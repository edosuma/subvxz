00:08.242 --> 00:09.177
Hey, Jackie.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.844
Hi, Happy Halloween.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.180
Listen, your mom's
really bummed out,

00:12.213 --> 00:13.281
and I'm going to
try and help her

00:13.314 --> 00:14.915
get back her Halloween spirit.

00:14.948 --> 00:15.816
You want to help?

00:15.849 --> 00:16.717
Not interested.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.187
I'll give you $20 bucks.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.221
Interested

00:20.254 --> 00:22.022
OK, here's the
plan, and we just

00:22.056 --> 00:23.457
want to get a rise out of her.

00:23.491 --> 00:24.925
So one thing that
usually always--

00:24.958 --> 00:29.163
Please, Jackie, I think I
know how to scare my mother.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.299
Hi, Happy Halloween.

00:31.332 --> 00:34.635
Did you see the Great
Pumpkin last night?

00:34.668 --> 00:38.406
No, Dan wore pajamas.

00:38.439 --> 00:42.376
Hey, Rosanne, did you see
that evidently in Nebraska where

00:42.410 --> 00:46.547
they grow corn for, uh,
various corn products,

00:46.580 --> 00:49.417
there have been a rash
of farmers losing body

00:49.450 --> 00:50.784
parts in threshing machines.

00:55.823 --> 00:58.192
Ah, oh, god, that's an ear.

01:03.231 --> 01:05.933
Give it up, Jackie.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.268
Oh, man.

01:07.301 --> 01:12.840
Oh, Jackie, what did you do
with the inside of the pumpkin?

01:12.873 --> 01:14.842
I put it down the
garbage disposal.

01:14.875 --> 01:15.843
That wasn't good?

01:15.876 --> 01:20.481
Well, no, turkey,
that wasn't good.

01:20.514 --> 01:23.317
Oh, man.

01:23.351 --> 01:26.187
Turn that light on, will you?

01:26.220 --> 01:27.621
[garbage disposal]

01:27.655 --> 01:32.726
[screaming]

01:32.760 --> 01:34.128
Oh, god, no.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.609
[theme music]

02:39.092 --> 02:41.094
Are you going to be OK, honey?

02:41.128 --> 02:44.131
Let me put it this way.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.200
Aw, come on, Rosie.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.302
I built that great
costume for us.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.504
We'll play a few tasteless
pranks on people.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.907
Everything will be fine once
we get down to the lodge party.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.075
Mmm, I ain't going.

02:55.108 --> 02:55.976
What?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.945
This is our special day.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.613
I mean, I know you're
upset about Becky, but--

02:59.647 --> 03:02.450
Oh, it's not just
Becky, it's everything.

03:02.483 --> 03:03.784
After what we've been
through this year,

03:03.817 --> 03:06.654
I just don't feel like
putting on some stupid costume

03:06.687 --> 03:08.489
and partying.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.891
Say it ain't so, Rose.

03:10.924 --> 03:15.863
I don't know, all of a sudden
mooning the retirement home

03:15.896 --> 03:19.066
and stuffing dead fish
through people's mail slots

03:19.099 --> 03:20.534
just seems somehow childish.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.544
[laughing]

03:30.578 --> 03:33.013
I know what you're doing.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.316
What the hell are
you talking about?

03:35.349 --> 03:36.884
Oh, man, this is
going to be big.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.151
So what's it going
to be, like a prank

03:38.185 --> 03:40.788
on the whole lodge--
don't, don't tell me.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.424
I want to be surprised.

03:43.457 --> 03:46.126
Oh, please let
me tell you, Dan.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.728
All right, all right, tell me.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.530
Oh, don't tell me.

03:49.563 --> 03:50.998
OK, tell me.

03:51.031 --> 03:53.867
OK, here's a hint.

03:53.901 --> 03:59.773
Uh, it starts off with you
being really disappointed.

03:59.807 --> 04:03.777
Oh, darn, I gave
away the ending.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.078
OK, I believe you.

04:07.548 --> 04:08.349
Give me another hint.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.164
How do I look?

04:27.234 --> 04:29.770
Well, it's nice to see
you in a skirt for a change.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.174
All right, I'm out of here.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.075
Hey, hey, hey, wait.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.143
Your brother's in the kitchen.

04:36.176 --> 04:36.977
He needs a ride.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.385
[knocking]

04:50.924 --> 04:53.694
- Trick or treat.
- Hi, hi.

04:53.727 --> 04:57.030
I know you guys are real scary.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.432
I'm sure scared here.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.267
All right, Happy Halloween.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.502
Have a nice night.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.336
See ya.

05:10.277 --> 05:13.080
How come he can't just
get there by himself?

05:13.113 --> 05:14.682
Because you're his big sister.

05:14.715 --> 05:15.949
You're going to
drive him over there.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.685
You're going to wheel him
in, and then you're going

05:17.718 --> 05:20.754
to lean him against a wall.

05:20.788 --> 05:21.789
Fine, then I'm out of there.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.824
How am I going to get home?

05:23.857 --> 05:26.927
Your dad will pick you
up after the lodge party.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.096
OK, let me hear your line.

05:29.129 --> 05:34.101
I ate his liver with some
fava beans and nice Chianti.

05:34.134 --> 05:35.369
Perfect, let's go.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.942
And remember, Darlene, when
you put him in the back seat,

05:41.975 --> 05:42.776
face up.

05:58.291 --> 06:02.696
[knocking]

06:10.303 --> 06:13.541
Whoa, what grade are you in?

06:13.574 --> 06:18.245
I am the ghost
of Halloween past.

06:18.278 --> 06:19.913
OK, here's your Snicker.

06:28.121 --> 06:32.960
GHOST: Do not toy with
me Roseanne Connor.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.929
How the hell did
you get in here?

06:35.963 --> 06:38.566
Tonight, the ghosts
of Halloween past,

06:38.599 --> 06:42.102
present, and future will
come to renew the joys

06:42.135 --> 06:43.804
of the Halloween spirit.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.272
You must come with me.

06:45.305 --> 06:46.173
Now.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.775
Who's under that sheet?

06:47.808 --> 06:48.709
Is that you, Fisher?

06:48.742 --> 06:52.145
Do not look under the sheet.

06:52.179 --> 06:54.682
Well, you want me
to go with you, right?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.016
How do I know that
you really are

06:56.049 --> 06:59.352
some evil and terrifying
spirit from beyond the grave

06:59.386 --> 07:03.557
and not just some ordinary
creep, huh, Casper?

07:03.591 --> 07:04.458
OK.

07:04.492 --> 07:05.826
Look under the sheet.

07:10.330 --> 07:11.198
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:18.639 --> 07:19.473
I'll get my purse.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.911
I want to know where
you're taking me.

07:23.944 --> 07:28.616
We must travel back
to where it all began.

07:28.649 --> 07:29.449
OK.

07:39.059 --> 07:42.095
Wow, cool trick.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.164
You are now at the
center of all time.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.234
You must travel back 39 years.

07:47.267 --> 07:50.070
Well, I hope you have
a tram or something.

07:54.942 --> 07:57.811
As you shall see,
the spirit of Halloween

07:57.845 --> 08:00.914
was with you from birth.

08:00.948 --> 08:05.385
Hey, that's me in
my little bassinet.

08:05.418 --> 08:09.022
There's Mom hovering over me.

08:09.056 --> 08:10.724
You know, until I was about
one, I thought she was

08:10.758 --> 08:14.895
just some huge annoying mobile.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.264
Look it, I'm in my bunny suit.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.800
I hated that bunny suit.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.803
You love your little
bunny suit, don't you?

08:22.836 --> 08:23.637
Yes.

08:26.473 --> 08:28.909
Your first Halloween.

08:28.942 --> 08:34.882
It's such a happy holiday,
full of magic and make believe.

08:34.915 --> 08:37.685
Man, she wasn't even
cool for the '50s.

08:40.287 --> 08:41.154
Rosie.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.592
(COUGHING) Sweetheart.

08:44.625 --> 08:46.694
Roseanne, are you all right?

08:46.727 --> 08:47.595
Roseanne!

08:47.628 --> 08:49.597
Oh, my goodness.

08:49.630 --> 08:50.497
Al?

08:50.530 --> 08:51.965
She's not breathing.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.433
She's turning blue.

08:53.466 --> 08:55.869
Al, call the doctor.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.305
Al!

08:58.338 --> 09:02.175
[baby giggling]

09:02.209 --> 09:03.677
So crude.

09:03.711 --> 09:05.879
This early prank
laid the foundation

09:05.913 --> 09:07.347
for a brilliant career.

09:19.993 --> 09:21.962
You shouldn't eat that, Jackie.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.064
Hey, you're not the
boss of me, Rosanne.

09:24.097 --> 09:24.965
Ha, ha, right.

09:29.202 --> 09:30.604
Why shouldn't I eat it?

09:30.638 --> 09:32.906
Well, everybody
knows they put poison

09:32.940 --> 09:34.708
and razor blades in those.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.111
Better give it to me.
- That's stupid.

09:38.145 --> 09:41.048
That's not really true.

09:41.081 --> 09:41.949
See?

09:41.982 --> 09:43.583
It's OK.

09:43.617 --> 09:45.418
Well, I guess you're right.

09:49.489 --> 09:51.892
[scream]

09:53.961 --> 09:57.397
[laughing]

09:57.430 --> 09:58.866
You know what
the best part was?

09:58.899 --> 10:01.368
I used to sell that
candy back to her later.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.815
And how could
you forget it was

10:14.848 --> 10:19.219
Halloween that brought a
kindred spirit into your life?

10:19.252 --> 10:21.889
Hey, Roseanne.

10:21.922 --> 10:26.026
Hi, Cindy, how's it going?

10:26.059 --> 10:27.627
So what are you
supposed to be?

10:27.661 --> 10:30.563
Oh, I'm Ginger from
Gilligan's Island, you know,

10:30.597 --> 10:32.900
if they never found the island.

10:32.933 --> 10:33.801
What are you?

10:33.834 --> 10:35.068
I'm a princess.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.837
Oh, a princess.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.707
I get it.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.374
This is my date, Dan Connor.

10:41.408 --> 10:44.211
How's it going?

10:44.244 --> 10:47.314
Oh, yeah, Ginger, if they
didn't find the island.

10:47.347 --> 10:48.916
Great costume.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.718
Thanks.

10:50.751 --> 10:55.188
So Roseanne, uh, why
aren't you dancing tonight?

10:55.222 --> 10:56.423
Oh, I didn't feel like it.

10:56.456 --> 10:59.259
I'm just running the apple bob.

10:59.292 --> 11:00.894
Come on, Cindy, give it a try.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.596
I'll let you go free.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.799
Well, all right.

11:05.833 --> 11:06.633
Hold this.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.074
What would you give me to hold
here there a couple minutes?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.847
[laughing]

11:19.880 --> 11:22.049
What's so funny?

11:22.082 --> 11:23.516
Oh, my god!

11:23.550 --> 11:25.886
Gee, Cindy, why so blue?

11:30.891 --> 11:33.193
Do you really
not want to dance?

11:33.226 --> 11:34.027
Depends.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.310
Oh, he never knew what hit him.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.380
And so, Roseanne
Connor, we have

11:53.413 --> 11:55.749
seen the importance of
the Halloween spirit

11:55.783 --> 11:57.484
you have since abandoned.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.319
And now we must return.

11:59.352 --> 12:01.855
Well, wait, there's other
stuff I want to see, like,

12:01.889 --> 12:04.324
uh, this one time I
took this coonskin cap,

12:04.357 --> 12:05.558
and I put it on my skateboard.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.460
And I pushed it out into
traffic and yelled watch out

12:07.494 --> 12:09.162
for my dog!

12:09.196 --> 12:12.299
[laughing] I'd love
to see that twice.

12:23.543 --> 12:25.913
[knocking]

12:30.918 --> 12:31.751
It was only a dream.

12:39.126 --> 12:43.696
I am the ghost of
Halloween present.

12:43.730 --> 12:44.798
No you're not.

12:44.832 --> 12:47.901
You're some great big
piece of candy corn.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.003
Gee, I get this all the time.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.438
Look, I'm a symbol of Halloween.

12:51.471 --> 12:54.875
Halloween, candy corn,
end of story, let's go.

12:54.908 --> 12:57.010
OK, but I hope nobody sees
us together, because I'm

12:57.044 --> 12:58.311
supposed to be on Slim Fast.

13:15.562 --> 13:18.098
I'm sorry, Jackie, I'm not
going in the ladies room.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.632
You're just going
to have to hold it.

13:19.666 --> 13:20.834
I've got to go sometime, Dan.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.503
Maybe you should just try
slowing down at the bar.

13:23.536 --> 13:24.905
Don't tell me what to do, Dan.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.706
I'm doing you a favor
just wearing this thing.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.541
Oh, yeah, like I'm
sure the real Marie

13:28.575 --> 13:30.543
Antoinette drank so much beer.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.988
So this is it, you
bring me to the lodge?

13:41.021 --> 13:45.792
Isn't there anything about my
life I could learn in Hawaii?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.627
Watch and learn.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.062
No, I'm not going
to let you see Fisher.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.430
You're just going to get
ticked off if he's still

13:50.463 --> 13:51.564
talking to that Indian girl.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.465
Fine.

13:52.499 --> 13:53.500
Then angle me toward the punch.

13:57.104 --> 13:57.905
Well?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.950
Ahh.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.385
Hey, honey, having fun?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.454
Oh, I love being
wedged under Dan's armpit

14:14.487 --> 14:17.324
while you're hanging out
with Pocahontas over there.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.725
She just came up to say hello.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.327
What was I supposed
to do, be rude?

14:20.360 --> 14:22.762
You know that this plays
with a lot of trust issues

14:22.795 --> 14:23.596
that I have.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.068
This is about last
night, isn't it?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.602
All I said was I love you.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.505
But it doesn't tell me
if you say it during sex.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.407
What difference does
it make when I say it?

14:34.441 --> 14:35.842
Because you're
completely out of control.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.210
You'd say anything.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.878
You want to know some of the
other things that you said.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.347
Hey, guys, can
I say something?

14:40.380 --> 14:41.481
Dan, do you mind?

14:41.514 --> 14:42.315
This is private.

14:48.088 --> 14:50.090
Who wants to shake my hand?

14:50.123 --> 14:52.192
Oh, come on somebody
wants to shake it.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.093
(BUZZ)

14:53.126 --> 14:55.495
Oh, whoa, whoa.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.165
It's called a joy buzzer.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.566
That was just me
playing a prank.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.934
Got it, Crystal.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.769
She do the joy buzzer thing?

15:06.539 --> 15:08.441
Oh, I sure do miss Roseanne.

15:08.475 --> 15:09.442
Me, too.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.311
Yeah, I thought
she'd be here by now.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.213
Just doesn't feel like
Halloween without her,

15:13.246 --> 15:14.547
you know?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.549
So is this the part where
I'm supposed to get all weepy

15:16.583 --> 15:19.252
and say, I wish I would've
gone to the party?

15:19.286 --> 15:20.153
No.

15:20.187 --> 15:21.688
Don't you get it?

15:21.721 --> 15:24.324
You've ruined the holiday
for all your friends.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.625
They need you.

15:25.658 --> 15:27.360
On the other hand,
at least we don't

15:27.394 --> 15:31.498
have to eat those god awful
pumpkin cookies she makes.

15:31.531 --> 15:33.333
Boy, she bakes once a year.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.535
You'd think it wouldn't
taste like grass.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.636
Hey!

15:36.669 --> 15:38.671
And, you know, some
of those pranks of hers.

15:38.705 --> 15:39.572
They aren't even funny.

15:39.606 --> 15:40.707
They're just plain mean.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.309
Yeah, but you have to
laugh like they're funny

15:42.342 --> 15:44.877
or she throws a tantrum
acts like a baby.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.380
I do not!

15:47.414 --> 15:48.681
Defend me, Dan.

15:48.715 --> 15:51.718
Hey, live with the woman.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.652
All I'm saying.

15:58.758 --> 16:01.794
Hey, what is this
supposed to teach me?

16:01.828 --> 16:02.762
I'm sorry.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.896
You weren't supposed
to hear that.

16:03.930 --> 16:05.732
Well, time's up, let's go.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.667
No, wait a minute.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.370
You think I was so hard to
live with before, Buddy,

16:10.403 --> 16:12.205
you just wait till you get home.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.074
He can't hear you.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.408
Oh, yeah?

16:15.442 --> 16:16.376
Dan!!!

16:16.409 --> 16:19.079
Ooh, anybody else get a chill?

16:21.948 --> 16:25.318
[knocking]

16:34.794 --> 16:38.565
I am the ghost of
Halloween future.

16:38.598 --> 16:41.501
Oh, OK.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.502
Come with me.

16:42.535 --> 16:44.237
Where are you taking me?

16:44.271 --> 16:46.673
You are there.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.310
You have already
stepped into the future.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.213
Now you must see what will
happen if you continue

16:53.246 --> 16:54.714
to deny the Halloween Spirit.

16:57.650 --> 17:00.687
Remember when this used to be
the coolest house on Halloween?

17:00.720 --> 17:02.922
Yeah, before Mrs. Conner
went through the change.

17:08.695 --> 17:12.232
Happy Halloween, boys.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.633
Trick or treat.

17:17.670 --> 17:19.739
Wow, mini toothpaste.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.875
And floss.

17:22.909 --> 17:26.446
Now you boys remember that
Halloween is a holiday of fun

17:26.479 --> 17:31.951
and treats not a
celebration of Satan.

17:31.984 --> 17:33.453
[buzzer]

17:33.486 --> 17:35.455
Excuse me, my game
hens are ready.

17:39.426 --> 17:42.562
Man, what happened to me?

17:42.595 --> 17:44.831
Come, you see it all.

17:49.602 --> 17:52.505
Remember, Darlene,
there is nothing

17:52.539 --> 17:57.110
like a game hen for Halloween
to really please your man.

17:57.144 --> 18:01.748
Yeah, I'm chopping vegetables,
Mom, just like you taught me.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.650
Oh, my goodness, Darlene!

18:07.654 --> 18:11.191
See, it's just a joke, Mom.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.193
Remember?

18:13.226 --> 18:15.061
Jokes.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.630
Darlene, there are
people on this earth who

18:17.664 --> 18:19.232
have chopped off
their arms who would

18:19.266 --> 18:23.203
not find that at all amusing.

18:23.236 --> 18:25.572
Roseanne, I'm leaving you.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.140
But why?

18:27.174 --> 18:29.542
Didn't I keep the
house clean enough.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.178
Wasn't I a good cook?

18:31.211 --> 18:32.078
It's not that.

18:32.111 --> 18:35.915
It's just that you bore me.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.918
Don't leave me,
Dan, I try the best

18:38.951 --> 18:41.454
I can, but I'm only a woman.

18:41.488 --> 18:46.559
Oh, god, Dan,
leave her, leave her.

18:46.593 --> 18:47.560
Dan, Dan!

18:47.594 --> 18:49.462
Do you have enough socks?

18:52.999 --> 18:55.902
Oh, my god, I've become
what I hate most.

18:55.935 --> 18:58.671
Not yet.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.740
You must go farther
into the future

19:00.773 --> 19:02.575
to see where this
path will lead you.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.245
I don't want to.

19:05.278 --> 19:10.016
You grew to be an elderly,
divorced woman living

19:10.049 --> 19:11.351
with your spinster sister.

19:14.053 --> 19:16.956
Oh, my god, I'm
living with Jackie?

19:16.989 --> 19:17.857
I don't see any more.

19:20.893 --> 19:23.530
Come on, Roseanne, we
don't want to be late.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.500
All right,
Jackie, I'm all set.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.203
Why is my mother here?

19:30.237 --> 19:32.705
That's not your
mother, Roseanne.

19:32.739 --> 19:36.175
That's you.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.579
[screaming]

19:46.118 --> 19:48.488
Oh, my god, there's still time.

19:57.129 --> 19:58.831
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

20:03.169 --> 20:04.036
-

20:04.070 --> 20:07.106
Rosie, thank god.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.142
Yeah, hey, everybody.

20:10.176 --> 20:12.345
Well, I just couldn't
stay home one more second

20:12.379 --> 20:14.914
feeling sorry for myself when
I knew that all you guys were

20:14.947 --> 20:17.950
down here missing me so
much and saying such really,

20:17.984 --> 20:21.087
really nice things about me.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.956
Yeah, you know how
much we love you, honey.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.358
Yeah.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.594
You know, Crystal, I
brought a whole truckload

20:27.627 --> 20:31.531
of my pumpkin cookies for you.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.132
And I've got something
for you later, Dan.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.904
Well, I'm so glad
you came, Roseanne.

20:37.937 --> 20:39.406
Want to shake my hand?

20:39.439 --> 20:41.374
Oh, I'll do that
later, but first I

20:41.408 --> 20:43.075
want to show you all my torch.

20:43.109 --> 20:46.546
Anybody got a light?

20:46.579 --> 20:49.048
So, So, uh, this
the whole thing?

20:49.081 --> 20:50.717
This is what we've
been waiting for?

20:50.750 --> 20:57.590
Oh, no, Dan, this is what
you've been waiting for.

20:57.624 --> 21:00.993
[fire alarm ringing]

21:04.531 --> 21:05.898
Happy Halloween.

21:16.809 --> 21:19.812
Turn me a light on, will ya?

21:19.846 --> 21:25.518
[screaming]

21:25.552 --> 21:26.919
Oh, my god!

21:36.529 --> 21:37.330
Handball?

21:44.371 --> 21:46.205
Stump the band?
