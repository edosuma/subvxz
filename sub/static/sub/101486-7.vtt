          -Hey, Lisa.
        -Oh, hey, Blake.

08:35.573 --> 08:38.164
      This is where I eat
    when I want to be alone.

08:38.227 --> 08:39.851
        Uh, I don't want
      to be alone, though.

08:40.003 --> 08:43.554
 Um, want to share wasabi peas?
      They're really dry.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.689
       Are you a veggie?

08:44.882 --> 08:46.358
          -Yes, I am.
           -Me, too.

08:46.551 --> 08:50.420
         This is a BLT:
   bread, lettuce and tomato.

08:50.522 --> 08:52.939
       Hey, quit talking
       to my girlfriend.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.258
   I am not your girlfriend.

08:55.318 --> 08:57.018
         Right, right.
        We're focused on

08:57.120 --> 08:59.353
    career days and homework
           right now.

08:59.456 --> 09:02.432
   -But love has a way of...
      -Get away from me.

09:02.492 --> 09:06.269
       Oh, my God, Lisa,
    we've become my parents.

09:06.329 --> 09:09.047
    Well, I just wanted to
 wish you good luck and, uh...

09:09.240 --> 09:11.383
        (blows sharply)

09:13.220 --> 09:16.096
     (smooth jazz playing)

09:27.943 --> 09:30.068
     (buzzing like insects)

09:31.262 --> 09:33.054
          -(loud zap)
        -(notes cry out)

09:33.073 --> 09:36.816
Ah, my favorite sound: silence.

09:36.910 --> 09:39.286
          (chuckling):
            See ya.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.431
     Okay, a little bigger
        than I thought.

09:59.624 --> 10:02.492
      Oh, boy, it's like
Burning Man for nerds, although

10:02.510 --> 10:05.252
to be fair, Burning Man is also
    Burning Man for nerds.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.254
  Man, there's a lot of nerds.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.090
         Hello, Hall H.

10:09.192 --> 10:12.444
      Let's let out a roar
    they can hear in Asgard.

10:12.637 --> 10:15.004
     Question, isn't sound
       to Asgard blocked

10:15.023 --> 10:16.506
    by the vacuum of space?

10:16.566 --> 10:19.676
 Actually, sound is transmitted
         by Yggdrasil,

10:19.736 --> 10:22.178
   the tree that connects the
   nine worlds of the cosmos.

10:22.197 --> 10:23.288
    But transmission doesn't
         come into it.

10:23.439 --> 10:24.939
 This has never not been true.

10:25.000 --> 10:28.609
    -(overlapping arguing)
   -Have you ever read <i> Thor?</i>

10:28.670 --> 10:31.187
        Wha-What? Whoa.

10:31.206 --> 10:34.023
  We have some of the greatest
 creators in the industry here.

10:34.084 --> 10:37.118
    Daniel Kim, Zoe Burwell,

10:37.220 --> 10:38.970
      and David Z. Cohen!

10:39.163 --> 10:42.123
           (cheering)

10:42.184 --> 10:43.700
    Oh, my God, oh, my God,
    oh, my God, oh, my God!

10:43.760 --> 10:46.219
  I've been blocked on Twitter
        by all of them.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.690
       And now it's time
   for... audience questions.

10:51.843 --> 10:53.193
     (microphone feedback)

10:54.104 --> 10:55.636
      Yes. Third position.

10:55.656 --> 10:57.656
        Time to prepare.
 And just two steps to the mic.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.306
         It's perfect.

10:59.326 --> 11:02.068
    Um, I-I'd like to ask,
   how would someone like me

11:02.162 --> 11:05.146
      get someone like you
     to-to look at my work?

11:05.207 --> 11:06.331
    I'll look at your work.

11:06.524 --> 11:09.150
 Uh, actually, uh, I-I don't...

11:09.211 --> 11:11.986
 I don't have any work, per se.

11:12.089 --> 11:13.988
             Next.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.899
  Closer to me. Closer to me.

11:15.959 --> 11:18.751
      (panting, grunting)

11:18.887 --> 11:20.753
         Isn't it true
   that Superman represented

11:20.847 --> 11:23.907
    the subconscious desire
    of creators Jerry Siegel

11:23.925 --> 11:28.169
   and Joe Shuster to defeat
   the Nazi menace in 1938?

11:28.230 --> 11:30.021
           Wow. Wow.

11:30.190 --> 11:31.931
      I have never heard
     a question that good.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.192
      (cheering, applause)

11:34.385 --> 11:36.085
  Oh, yes, yes, good question.

11:36.104 --> 11:38.697
    And I believe the answer
          is "a-doy."

11:38.890 --> 11:42.516
     And now for the query
   that will blow them away.

11:42.577 --> 11:44.761
 <i> Uh, uh, where's my question?</i>

11:44.779 --> 11:46.520
 <i> Ha, did I use it as a napkin?</i>

11:46.623 --> 11:49.190
   <i> No, I never use a napkin.</i>
       <i> Ugh, where is it?</i>

11:49.251 --> 11:51.768
             -Next!
           -Um, uh...

11:51.828 --> 11:53.937
 Yes, my question is, um, uh...

11:53.997 --> 11:56.697
  Okay, I forgot my question.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.217
      Worst question ever.

11:59.410 --> 12:01.869
             -No!
          -(laughter)

12:01.930 --> 12:03.963
       Welcome to Marvel.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.132
           (crying):
              No.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.952
We could offer you a job at DC.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.711
        Yes, hard pass.

12:10.772 --> 12:13.639
 Ugh. Just when I thought this
 day could not get any worse.

12:13.792 --> 12:15.382
            (laughs)

12:15.485 --> 12:19.462
   Okay, the day you've been
 waiting for: chair challenges.

12:19.522 --> 12:22.532
      We begin with Ralph
challenging for first triangle.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.077
            (grunts)
      I'm halfway through.

12:26.270 --> 12:29.897
   Once again, first triangle
    will be an empty chair.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.808
     The better chair won.

12:31.868 --> 12:34.902
   Now, for first saxophone,
         Lisa Simpson.

12:34.963 --> 12:37.422
        Hey, vegetarian,
       I soaked your reed

12:37.573 --> 12:38.831
       -in hot dog water.
            -(gasps)

12:38.925 --> 12:40.759
          Ew, ew, ew.

12:40.952 --> 12:42.485
      (saxophone playing)

12:42.545 --> 12:44.596
        Terrible. Blake?

12:44.789 --> 12:47.414
       -(saxophone plays)
     -Terrible, but better.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.250
      -You're first chair.
            -(gasps)

12:49.352 --> 12:51.936
      You were playing me
        the whole time.

12:52.129 --> 12:54.088
      (school bell rings)

12:54.107 --> 12:56.090
  Don't you walk away from me.

12:56.193 --> 12:58.851
       Well, very soon,
      I will outplay you,

12:58.945 --> 13:00.761
   my blues will be blue-ier,

13:00.822 --> 13:02.947
       my "Baker Street"
      will be more baked,

13:03.140 --> 13:05.008
 and I will get my chair back.

13:05.068 --> 13:07.360
      It may not be today,
          or tomorrow,

13:07.454 --> 13:09.621
       because tomorrow
     we have a field trip,

13:09.790 --> 13:12.773
     or two days after that
       because that's...

13:12.834 --> 13:16.277
       that's no school,
      but-but on the 11th.

13:16.338 --> 13:19.022
        Yeah, the 11th,
       it's mine, buddy.

13:19.082 --> 13:20.281
    That's the science fair.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.616
 Aah! Thanks for reminding me!

13:22.677 --> 13:23.760
            (shouts)

13:25.305 --> 13:28.214
    Okay, audition for King
  of Cookie Castle, take one.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.716
   Okay, you got this, Phil.
    Book it, book it good.

13:30.869 --> 13:33.294
           -We ready?
     -Off with their heads.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.204
      Off with their feet.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.982
         Grind the rest
      into a sugary treat.

13:38.175 --> 13:40.226
  Beautiful, you got the part.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.895
  Beautiful, you got the <i> fart.</i>
          (fart noise)

13:43.048 --> 13:45.214
           (laughs)
    Hey, the kid's not bad.

13:45.275 --> 13:46.841
         We might have
      a part for him, too.

13:46.843 --> 13:50.553
And if he improvises like that,
    I can fire the writers.

13:50.613 --> 13:52.055
        Read this, kid.

13:52.991 --> 13:54.866
       (English accent):
        Eat my tights.

13:55.018 --> 13:56.409
         -You're hired.
             -Wow.

13:56.561 --> 13:59.653
    Who knew it was so easy
   to become a working actor?

13:59.714 --> 14:01.155
             MARGE:
              Hmm.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.842
  Okay, everyone say one thing
        they did today.

14:03.993 --> 14:05.159
          I'll start.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.178
       I lost my half-cup
         measuring cup,

14:07.371 --> 14:08.829
  so I used two quarter cups.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.573
        Crisis averted.

14:10.633 --> 14:12.592
  I booked a voice-over job,
  and the show airs tomorrow.

14:12.686 --> 14:15.002
      I thought animation
       took nine months.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.413
   No, you can do any cartoon
           in a day.

14:17.473 --> 14:20.433
Anyone who takes longer is just
trying to bleed the studio dry.

14:20.585 --> 14:22.935
        And this is what
       they're paying me.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.587
           (scoffs)
        That's baloney.

14:24.647 --> 14:26.847
       Anybody could fake
        a check from...

14:26.908 --> 14:29.092
   "Warner Bros. Animation."

14:29.110 --> 14:30.684
        No, it's legit.

14:30.745 --> 14:33.613
    I made more in a minute
 than you do in a month, fatso.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.598
      -Why, you little...
         -Uhp-uhp-uhp.

14:35.658 --> 14:37.691
        Keep your hands
      off the moneymaker.

14:37.752 --> 14:38.935
And don't look me in the voice.

14:38.995 --> 14:42.288
           (grunts)
    Lisa, how was your day?

14:42.382 --> 14:44.716
   Well, my life is in ruin,

14:44.867 --> 14:47.868
and I'm trying to think of some
possible plan to rescue myself.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.370
        Plans are fine,

14:49.389 --> 14:52.281
    but never underestimate
    the power of giving up.

14:52.342 --> 14:56.043
 Because if you think about it,
      see, uh, s-spontan--

14:56.104 --> 14:57.637
         eh, forget it.

14:57.789 --> 15:00.289
          <i> ANNOUNCER:</i>
   <i> Coming up,</i> Cookie Castle,

       Oh, I still think
     we all could have fit.

15:05.221 --> 15:06.479
      Now get a good look.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.756
    This is your last chance
       to see normal Bart

15:08.783 --> 15:11.058
    before I become a star.

15:11.161 --> 15:14.078
 Then I'll be the guy who sells
 you out with a tell-all book.

15:14.271 --> 15:16.039
           Boo-yeah.

15:21.112 --> 15:22.420
      (cheering, applause)

15:22.613 --> 15:23.904
        Yeah, go, Bart.

15:23.965 --> 15:26.499
            (gasps)
   You got the "and" credit.

15:26.593 --> 15:30.911
   I negotiated that, in lieu
of having a teacher on set. Bam.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.680
         (lions growl)

15:34.809 --> 15:38.937
   I kneel before you, Jules.

           -Come on.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.188
            (gasps)
   They didn't tell me that.

15:49.324 --> 15:51.432
  My place is in the scullery.

15:51.493 --> 15:55.453
 (groans) I thought "scullery"
was where they kept the skulls.

(singsongy): Bart plays a girl,
      Bart plays a girl.

I'm proud that my brother isn't

      Ugh. I hate the way
     your generation talks.

16:32.275 --> 16:33.807
 I have something to tell you.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.643
Oh, don't tell me I'm nominated

But what you're doing is brave,

16:46.256 --> 16:47.730
    and you should be proud.

16:47.790 --> 16:48.731
            Really?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.341
    That's right, my friend.

16:50.534 --> 16:53.252
  You should walk into school
