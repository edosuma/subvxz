10:17.939 --> 10:19.673
I meant to tell you this
myself.

10:19.708 --> 10:21.509
Tell me what?

10:21.543 --> 10:24.246
Sit down.

10:24.280 --> 10:25.814
No, coach, I don't want you
to sugarcoat it.

10:25.848 --> 10:27.615
I just want you to tell me
straight. What is it?

10:34.290 --> 10:36.859
They don't want you.
They want Vince.

10:36.893 --> 10:38.795
They knew you were friends.

10:38.829 --> 10:41.031
They went through you
to get to him.

10:41.065 --> 10:42.732
I should have seen it,
and I didn't,

10:42.767 --> 10:44.400
and I apologize.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.402
I'm pretty sure they want
both of us, coach.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.871
I talked to Karl Gauge
yesterday...

10:47.905 --> 10:50.573
I'm pretty sure that I know
what I'm talking about.

10:50.607 --> 10:54.676
I was blindsided,
and I apologize for it.

10:54.711 --> 10:57.245
I should have been watching
out for you better.

10:59.548 --> 11:01.382
All the tickets

11:01.416 --> 11:04.251
and the taking me down there
and everything?

11:04.285 --> 11:05.352
Let me tell you something.

11:05.387 --> 11:06.720
You're a hell of an athlete.

11:06.755 --> 11:09.123
You're gonna have a hell
of a lot more opportunities.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.727
Sit down a second, would you?

11:13.762 --> 11:15.095
No, I'm all right.

11:15.129 --> 11:16.663
Okay.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.601
Thank you.

11:22.637 --> 11:24.905
Coach, aren't you
gonna suspend somebody?

11:24.940 --> 11:25.906
Coach, I'm not gonna
suspend anyone

11:25.941 --> 11:27.474
for doing something
that stupid.

11:27.508 --> 11:29.309
Hell, it's not like we didn't
do anything worse.

11:29.343 --> 11:31.778
I took a dump
in a mailbox once.

11:34.282 --> 11:35.716
Sorry, coach.
I didn't even know you.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.117
It was your first season.

11:37.152 --> 11:38.952
I got them
in the bleachers, coach.

11:38.987 --> 11:40.020
Good.

11:40.055 --> 11:41.055
You gonna rip 'em a new one?

11:41.089 --> 11:42.756
I would rip 'em a new one.

11:42.791 --> 11:46.927
I'll take that
under consideration, thank you.

11:46.962 --> 11:48.596
Here he comes!

11:48.630 --> 11:50.098
You ready?
Get ready now.

11:50.132 --> 11:51.599
Listen up.

11:51.633 --> 11:55.303
It's come to my attention...

11:55.337 --> 11:57.705
[laughter]

12:05.713 --> 12:07.147
Put 'em down.

12:10.384 --> 12:13.586
It's come to my attention
that several of you

12:13.621 --> 12:15.921
have permanently scarred
yourselves

12:15.956 --> 12:18.790
by branding your bodies
with a...

12:18.825 --> 12:20.492
What the hell was it,
a salad fork?

12:20.526 --> 12:23.661
Coat hanger,
Mr. Kingmaker, sir.

12:25.230 --> 12:26.931
Let me tell you something.

12:26.965 --> 12:28.666
You know,
it's every coach's dream

12:28.700 --> 12:31.035
to experience
the highest level of idiocy

12:31.069 --> 12:32.436
that his team can muster.

12:32.470 --> 12:35.205
And, gentlemen,
collectively us coaches,

12:35.240 --> 12:37.040
we are living a dream.

12:37.075 --> 12:40.277
But we'd like for you
to live your dreams too.

12:40.311 --> 12:42.813
So we're gonna allow you
to live the dream

12:42.847 --> 12:45.349
of realizing
just how far it is you can run

12:45.383 --> 12:46.951
before you can run no more,

12:46.985 --> 12:49.887
led with the tutelage
of coach Traub.

12:49.921 --> 12:52.157
Begin living your dream.
Hop to it.

12:52.191 --> 12:54.192
- Let's go.
- Live the dream!

12:54.226 --> 12:55.327
We were just being a team.

12:55.361 --> 12:56.462
Live the dream!

12:56.496 --> 12:57.930
Let's live it!

12:59.399 --> 13:01.600
Vince!

13:02.769 --> 13:05.338
Yes, sir.

13:05.372 --> 13:08.340
Didn't I ask you
to not say anything to Luke?

13:10.943 --> 13:13.811
Yes, you did, but it
just kind of slipped out.

13:13.846 --> 13:14.912
I didn't want to lie to him.

13:14.947 --> 13:16.647
I didn't ask you to lie to him.

13:16.681 --> 13:19.416
I simply asked you
to keep your mouth shut.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.518
I di... I tried, but...

13:22.552 --> 13:24.920
I'm sorry.

13:26.723 --> 13:29.058
I'm... I'm gonna run.

13:32.462 --> 13:33.696
I am dying
to hear about school,

13:33.730 --> 13:35.164
and I am trying
not to be pushy,

13:35.199 --> 13:37.467
but you haven't said a word.

13:37.501 --> 13:38.935
Can you tell me about it?

13:38.969 --> 13:40.070
How's it going?

13:40.104 --> 13:42.773
Classes?

13:42.807 --> 13:44.742
Mom, they make
you take all G.E.s

13:44.776 --> 13:47.745
your first semester anyway,
so...

13:47.779 --> 13:50.448
It's just whatever.

13:52.084 --> 13:55.119
Boys?

13:57.089 --> 13:58.522
Don't know.

14:01.493 --> 14:03.594
What's going on?

14:03.628 --> 14:06.030
If I tell you something,

14:06.064 --> 14:08.933
can you promise
not to freak out?

14:11.770 --> 14:13.137
Mm-hmm.

14:15.507 --> 14:19.544
I kind of was messing around
with this T.A.,

14:19.578 --> 14:21.212
who is married,

14:21.246 --> 14:23.214
but was supposedly separated,

14:23.248 --> 14:24.649
but it turns out
he's not as separated

14:24.683 --> 14:25.950
as I thought he was.

14:25.985 --> 14:29.020
And his wife is crazy
and came to my dorm room

14:29.054 --> 14:31.956
and physically assaulted me
in front of everybody and...

14:31.991 --> 14:33.558
Did she hurt you, hon?

14:33.592 --> 14:34.960
No, I'm fine.
It's just...

14:34.994 --> 14:36.628
She slapped me
in front of everybody,

14:36.662 --> 14:39.664
the whole dorm.

14:39.699 --> 14:41.199
I can't go back there,

14:41.234 --> 14:43.702
and I don't know what to do.

14:48.174 --> 14:49.908
With her teacher?

14:49.942 --> 14:51.576
Her T.A.

14:51.610 --> 14:54.979
With her married T.A.,
who's how old?

14:55.013 --> 14:57.248
I don't know.

14:57.283 --> 14:58.516
Did you ask her
how old this guy is?

14:58.550 --> 15:00.285
No, honey, I didn't ask her.

15:00.319 --> 15:03.254
I was in shock.

15:03.289 --> 15:05.956
And, you know, just come here.

15:05.991 --> 15:07.457
Just come sit down
so we can talk.

15:07.492 --> 15:10.594
I don't want to sit down.

15:10.628 --> 15:13.197
Then stop thinking
what you're thinking.

15:13.232 --> 15:14.398
I'm gonna go up there,

15:14.432 --> 15:15.666
and I'm gonna
kick that kid's ass

15:15.700 --> 15:17.501
- is what I'm gonna do.
- No, you're not.

15:17.536 --> 15:18.836
What the hell is someone doing,

15:18.870 --> 15:20.304
running around with
the students up at the school?

15:20.338 --> 15:21.372
Running around
with my damn daughter?

15:21.406 --> 15:22.873
- Honey, shh!
- One of the T.A.s?

15:22.908 --> 15:24.775
- Honey! Honey!
- A married T.A.?

15:24.810 --> 15:25.810
She is humiliated...

15:25.844 --> 15:26.978
Damn well hope so, honey.

15:27.012 --> 15:28.313
And ashamed.

15:28.347 --> 15:30.382
Honey, our daughter
is destroyed right now.

15:30.416 --> 15:33.584
That's what we need
to focus on.

15:38.891 --> 15:40.591
We need to be compassionate.

15:46.598 --> 15:49.333
Oh. You know she wrecked
that car on purpose.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.869
No.

15:51.903 --> 15:54.037
Think about it.

15:54.072 --> 15:55.539
No, she did not.

15:55.574 --> 15:57.508
- Think about it.
- No, she did not.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.677
I knew something was wrong.
Think about it, honey.

15:59.711 --> 16:03.881
Honey, she wouldn't do that.

16:16.397 --> 16:18.231
[Knocking]

16:18.266 --> 16:20.500
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

16:22.670 --> 16:24.538
Okay.

16:24.573 --> 16:28.042
Dad's pretty pissed, huh?

16:28.076 --> 16:30.010
Well, I think
he's worried about you.

16:30.045 --> 16:33.747
But he loves you.
We both do.

16:33.781 --> 16:37.717
Always will,
no matter what happens.

16:37.751 --> 16:40.986
I need to ask you something.

16:41.021 --> 16:43.755
Did you really swerve the car

16:43.790 --> 16:46.959
to avoid hitting that dog?

16:51.498 --> 16:52.665
No.

16:55.769 --> 16:58.070
Why'd you do that, honey?

16:58.105 --> 17:00.807
It was a stupid,
stupid, stupid decision.

17:00.842 --> 17:01.975
I just...

17:04.413 --> 17:06.814
I didn't know what else to do.

17:06.848 --> 17:08.049
And I'm sorry, and I will pay

17:08.083 --> 17:09.550
for whatever it costs
to fix the car.

17:09.586 --> 17:10.586
It's not about the money.

17:10.619 --> 17:12.288
I'm not talking
about the money.

17:12.321 --> 17:13.556
I'm talking about,

17:13.589 --> 17:15.124
what are these choices
that you are making?

17:15.157 --> 17:16.926
I understand that the choices

17:16.961 --> 17:18.228
that I have
been making recently

17:18.262 --> 17:19.896
have not been the brightest,

17:19.931 --> 17:23.367
but I feel like I just jumped
into this whole college thing.

17:23.402 --> 17:25.170
It was way too premature,

17:25.204 --> 17:26.505
and maybe
I should go traveling.

17:26.539 --> 17:27.906
Maybe I should go to Europe.

17:27.940 --> 17:30.275
- Maybe this whole thing isn't me.
- Honey, honey, honey...

17:30.309 --> 17:31.710
No.

17:31.744 --> 17:34.079
You're not running away
from anything.

17:34.113 --> 17:36.715
You are an adult right now.

17:36.749 --> 17:38.384
You need to think
about your choices,

17:38.418 --> 17:40.318
and you need to take
responsibility for them.

17:40.353 --> 17:41.920
That is what you do.

17:41.954 --> 17:44.190
That is the girl that I raised.

17:50.030 --> 17:51.197
I just don't understand

17:51.231 --> 17:52.932
why Billy wouldn't let me
say hi to Tim

17:52.966 --> 17:54.166
for like five minutes.

17:54.201 --> 17:55.635
I just wanted to say hi.

17:55.669 --> 17:57.670
Yeah, Becky, 'cause
it's a prison and not a dorm.

17:57.704 --> 17:59.672
I know that.

17:59.706 --> 18:01.474
You know what,

18:01.508 --> 18:04.910
I really feel like you need to
put your focus somewhere else.

18:04.944 --> 18:07.312
Release a little tension...

18:07.346 --> 18:09.147
With someone.

18:09.181 --> 18:11.182
Sex?

18:11.216 --> 18:12.950
[Laughs]

18:12.985 --> 18:15.085
Oh.
I don't know.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.621
Well what about
that, uh, cutie farm boy, Luke?

18:17.655 --> 18:19.255
He's hot.

18:19.290 --> 18:20.790
Yeah, I've kind of been there,

18:20.824 --> 18:22.658
and that didn't go so well.

18:22.692 --> 18:24.860
You dated him?

18:24.894 --> 18:26.461
Well, we didn't exactly date.

18:26.496 --> 18:29.164
It's...
It's a long story.

18:29.198 --> 18:31.200
Okay.

18:31.234 --> 18:32.868
Good, 'cause
I think someone your age

18:32.902 --> 18:34.302
should have a boyfriend.

18:34.337 --> 18:35.504
Or 12.

18:35.538 --> 18:36.972
[Laughs]

18:37.006 --> 18:39.274
Mm, winner.

18:39.308 --> 18:42.978
Mm-mmm, rhinestones
make me look trashy.

18:43.012 --> 18:44.813
[Laughs]

18:44.847 --> 18:46.848
Roll back, roll back!

18:46.883 --> 18:48.283
Come off the ball now!
Let's go!

18:48.317 --> 18:49.351
Hike.

18:49.386 --> 18:51.453
Downhill, downhill!

18:51.488 --> 18:53.055
Hit it hard.

18:53.089 --> 18:54.824
Cafferty, come on!

18:54.858 --> 18:57.459
You gotta get off your block
and make a tackle!

18:57.494 --> 19:00.195
Hey, that kid didn't
even play football last year,

19:00.230 --> 19:01.530
and he's taking you
out of the play.

19:01.564 --> 19:02.965
What the hell's
the matter with you?

19:02.999 --> 19:04.366
I don't know. Why don't
you ask the kingmaker?

19:04.401 --> 19:07.803
I'm asking you!

19:07.837 --> 19:10.139
Coach, it's like
we're going half-speed.

19:10.173 --> 19:13.008
You want to run 'em,
maybe get their mind right?

19:17.546 --> 19:19.013
You do me a favor?

19:19.047 --> 19:20.147
Sure.

19:20.182 --> 19:22.082
Finish up this practice.

19:24.085 --> 19:27.188
All right.

19:30.459 --> 19:32.227
Where's...
where's coach going?

19:32.261 --> 19:33.394
All right, call it again.

19:33.429 --> 19:34.763
Same set. Go again.

19:34.797 --> 19:35.797
Same set.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.889
Did you know he was married
and had a wife?

20:20.809 --> 20:22.610
What's up?

20:22.644 --> 20:25.212
What the hell is this?

20:25.246 --> 20:26.246
Yo, where the rest of my money?

20:26.280 --> 20:27.414
That's all I can get.

20:27.449 --> 20:29.050
- I'm working on it.
- You working on it?

20:29.084 --> 20:30.451
Man, where the rest
of my money, man?

20:30.485 --> 20:31.886
You gonna get your money,
a'ight?

20:31.920 --> 20:33.621
- Just get off my ass a little.
- Yo, hold that down.

20:33.655 --> 20:36.090
I own your ass, remember that.

20:36.124 --> 20:37.591
I ain't one of your fans
over there at the field.

20:37.626 --> 20:39.093
You gonna come up
off my money, man.

20:39.127 --> 20:41.329
Hey, man, you gonna
get your money, a'ight?

20:41.363 --> 20:44.231
So just take that and step off.

20:44.265 --> 20:46.133
I've got a lot of people
watching my back.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.602
You gonna be sorry
you ever messed with me.

20:58.246 --> 20:59.480
What are you doing?

20:59.514 --> 21:05.286
Just finishing up
with some things.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.021
You're hiding.

21:07.055 --> 21:08.822
I'm not hiding.

21:08.856 --> 21:10.957
Well, I don't blame you.

21:10.992 --> 21:14.161
It's a little strange
in there right now.

21:14.195 --> 21:17.398
What do we know about this guy?

21:17.432 --> 21:19.166
Nothing.

21:19.200 --> 21:21.134
She's running away from him.

21:21.169 --> 21:23.537
Doesn't seem
like true love to me.

21:23.571 --> 21:26.072
Jeez.

21:26.106 --> 21:28.542
Our daughter slept
with another woman's husband.

21:28.576 --> 21:31.111
She doesn't seem to
understand her actions at all.

21:31.145 --> 21:33.112
She seems to be
in complete denial.

21:33.147 --> 21:34.881
Maybe what she needs
is a good kick in the ass.

21:34.916 --> 21:36.716
Well, that's probably true.

21:36.750 --> 21:40.019
[Whispering] I don't know
that girl in there.

21:40.053 --> 21:42.054
Yeah, you do.

21:44.357 --> 21:47.859
She needs her parents
right now.

21:54.666 --> 21:56.700
Morning.

21:56.735 --> 21:57.701
Morning.

21:57.736 --> 22:00.337
Good morning.

22:00.371 --> 22:02.973
Here's what we're gonna do.

22:03.007 --> 22:05.309
I'm gonna call
the mechanic this morning.

22:05.343 --> 22:07.511
I'm gonna have him
fix that car.

22:07.546 --> 22:09.046
And I'm gonna pay for it
myself,

22:09.080 --> 22:10.949
and then you're gonna
pay me back,

22:10.983 --> 22:13.551
because it was
your responsibility.

22:13.586 --> 22:15.187
When that car shows up here
this afternoon,

22:15.221 --> 22:17.390
you're gonna get in that car,
and you're gonna go to school.

22:23.765 --> 22:25.699
Okay.

22:26.968 --> 22:29.703
I'll see you
later this afternoon.

22:29.737 --> 22:32.005
- Bye, honey.
- See you.

22:32.039 --> 22:34.808
Bye, have a good one.

22:34.842 --> 22:36.709
[Door closes]

22:36.743 --> 22:39.011
Rip 61 "x" choice.

22:39.045 --> 22:40.212
What's my read?

22:40.247 --> 22:41.747
Look, Hastings,
just get open, all right?

22:41.781 --> 22:43.616
I'll throw you the ball.
Just catch it.

22:43.650 --> 22:45.350
Touchdown.

22:45.385 --> 22:46.885
I think what QB1
is trying to say

22:46.919 --> 22:49.387
is that your read's
the free safety, all right?

22:49.422 --> 22:51.122
If he stays deep,
you run a hook,

22:51.157 --> 22:52.958
and if he comes back,
then you run the slant.

22:52.992 --> 22:54.460
Right?

22:54.494 --> 22:56.061
All right, Luke,
you know your stuff.

22:56.096 --> 22:58.431
Keep working on that arm,
maybe you be qb1 one day.

22:58.465 --> 22:59.766
Yeah, maybe I should be.

22:59.800 --> 23:01.935
Then I'd have TMU all over
my ass instead of yours,

23:01.969 --> 23:03.870
and I'd be
on magazine covers, huh?

23:03.905 --> 23:05.872
Yo, dude, you all right?

23:05.907 --> 23:07.307
They came after me.

23:07.341 --> 23:08.809
You asked me
to go to that game.

23:08.843 --> 23:09.809
I didn't have anything
to do with this.

23:09.844 --> 23:10.944
I'm aware of what happened.

23:10.978 --> 23:11.978
You've told me
about 5 million times

23:12.013 --> 23:13.146
that's how I know.

23:13.181 --> 23:14.414
Well, I thought I was doing
you a favor.

23:14.449 --> 23:15.882
How are you doing me a favor

23:15.917 --> 23:17.284
by taking my scholarship,
Vince?

23:17.318 --> 23:18.452
I took your scholarship?
Do you hear this guy?

23:18.486 --> 23:20.154
Thanks, man.
Thank you.

23:20.188 --> 23:21.221
See you guys later.

23:21.256 --> 23:23.190
If you need help, come ask me.

23:34.869 --> 23:37.536
If you was mine, you wouldn't
be taking out no trash.

23:37.571 --> 23:38.771
- Okay, get...
- Where you goin'?

23:38.805 --> 23:40.106
- Don't touch me!
- Where you goin'?

23:40.140 --> 23:41.440
- Get off of me!
- Where you goin'?

23:41.474 --> 23:43.542
Now, your boy owe me money.

23:43.576 --> 23:44.810
He's trying to get your money.

23:44.844 --> 23:46.946
Ain't tryin' to hear
about no tryin'.

23:46.980 --> 23:48.581
It needs to get done.

23:48.615 --> 23:53.687
Otherwise, buildings might
start bursting into flames.

23:53.721 --> 23:55.322
Yeah, it's a barbecue joint.

23:55.356 --> 23:56.991
Lot of grease, baby.

23:57.025 --> 24:01.396
All it takes is one match.

with more fortitude

24:17.581 --> 24:19.515

Hold on.

24:34.632 --> 24:35.665
Is Becky here?

24:35.700 --> 24:36.933
Uh, no, no.

24:36.968 --> 24:38.368
She's with mindy right now.

24:38.403 --> 24:40.437
Well, I gotta... I really
gotta talk to her.

24:40.471 --> 24:42.005
- She's not here.
- All right.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.206
She's with Mindy.

They'll be back
in a little while.

Where you goin'?

24:45.609 --> 24:46.743
Tell her that...

24:46.777 --> 24:48.778
Tell her that I need
to talk to her, okay?

24:48.813 --> 24:51.581
Are you drunk?

24:51.615 --> 24:53.349
Yeah.

24:53.384 --> 24:54.384
You got a game
tomorrow, Cafferty!

24:54.418 --> 24:56.152
You think that's a good idea?

24:56.186 --> 24:57.921
It doesn't matter.

24:59.957 --> 25:01.224
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:01.258 --> 25:02.559
Where the hell
you think you're going?

25:02.593 --> 25:04.460
- I'm all right.
- No, you're not all right.

25:04.495 --> 25:06.696
And you're not driving like...
Hey, come here!

25:10.066 --> 25:12.501
Get your ass inside, all right?

25:12.535 --> 25:14.336
I'm taking out the trash,
I turn around,

25:14.371 --> 25:15.537
and the little twerp

25:15.572 --> 25:17.072

up against my face.

He grabs me, and he throws me
up against the trash can.

to get away.

- Yeah.
- All right, I'ma handle him.

about to call the cops.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.416
No. No, no, no, no.

25:27.450 --> 25:28.617

25:28.651 --> 25:30.318

to make things right.

that look in your eyes.

call the cops, okay?

We gotta just tell them
what happened.

25:37.326 --> 25:38.492
We can't go to the cops!

We gonna have to go
to somebody.

extra money

playing football?

about scholarships

when you were eight years old?

No.

You were playing because
you loved the game, right?

27:10.390 --> 27:11.890
You gotta go back to that place

27:11.925 --> 27:13.192
where this game used to be fun.

27:13.226 --> 27:15.962
Where it used to be
a joy every single day

to strap on those pads
and put on that helmet.

all right?

the smallest guy on my team,

27:34.614 --> 27:36.215
but I played with heart.

You gotta get your heart
back into the game.

you don't have any heart.

out of my turds.

you should tell him.

I should say that.

And I guarantee you
that he is missing you.

41:06.598 --> 41:08.099
He is counting the days

41:08.133 --> 41:09.601
when y'all can
all be together again

41:09.635 --> 41:11.569
as a family.

41:15.742 --> 41:17.810
Yeah, like I did.

41:26.487 --> 41:29.122
Um, who gonna help me
finish this pie now?

41:29.156 --> 41:31.124
'Cause I can't do it
all by myself.

41:31.158 --> 41:32.158
I will!

41:32.193 --> 41:33.527
There you go!

41:33.561 --> 41:36.364
Boy, you better start eating.

41:42.439 --> 41:44.273
[Car keys jingle]

42:21.776 --> 42:24.945
I didn't mean
to disappoint you.
