Oh, I'm so happy you're here.

02:14.051 --> 02:16.970

02:16.971 --> 02:18.596
Something happened last night, Mom.

02:18.597 --> 02:20.932
Something incredible!

02:20.933 --> 02:21.933
I finally figured out

02:21.934 --> 02:23.561
why I've been such a jerk to you.

02:26.188 --> 02:29.524
I've always just felt like you didn't want me,

02:29.525 --> 02:31.861

02:33.445 --> 02:36.990

02:36.991 --> 02:39.742

No, sir.

Same situation as Project Icarus...

03:02.224 --> 03:03.766
some sort of electrical pulse,

subjects disappear?

I'm not in charge, sir.

03:19.825 --> 03:21.493
I'm-- I'm just a lieutenant.

No, sir.

03:28.626 --> 03:30.418
I'm Lieutenant Assistent.

your last name is "Assistent"?

03:35.299 --> 03:37.383

03:37.384 --> 03:38.676
Yes.

03:38.677 --> 03:41.430
Gah! Why is everything so stupid?

03:48.187 --> 03:50.438
I've been going about this all wrong.

05:48.182 --> 05:49.223

05:53.979 --> 05:55.314
Where's Dirk?

05:56.690 --> 05:57.816
Mm.

05:58.942 --> 05:59.859
Hi!

06:03.322 --> 06:05.365
Last night, you and all your friends,

06:05.366 --> 06:06.991
you were out there yelling

06:06.992 --> 06:08.868
and kissing

06:08.869 --> 06:13.498
and just grabbing each other's butts
and giving each other compliments.

06:13.499 --> 06:14.540
It was a mess.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.835
Mm. I-It was a mistake...
coming in here.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.963
I-I-I was in
quite a state last night...

06:20.964 --> 06:22.590
Are you back
to being scared of me?

06:22.591 --> 06:23.800
- Mm-hmm.
- Why?

06:23.801 --> 06:24.884
You tried to kill me.

06:24.885 --> 06:25.760
This again?

06:25.761 --> 06:27.553
Yeah, sorry.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.680
This forever.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.226
Aah!

06:33.227 --> 06:35.478
You know, I don't get you.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.271
You're going through
the same thing as me,

06:37.272 --> 06:38.815
I can tell.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.859
Do you even know how it works?

06:41.985 --> 06:44.821
You talk about
the interconnectedness

06:44.822 --> 06:46.197
with all those big, fancy words,

06:46.198 --> 06:49.951
but do you even know
what you are?

06:49.952 --> 06:51.661
Do you?

06:51.662 --> 06:53.663
Do you have an answer, Bart?

06:53.664 --> 06:56.249
You're not exactly a bastion
of eloquent, articulate thought,

06:56.250 --> 06:58.000
but do you have some
kind of insight to offer me,

06:58.001 --> 06:59.710
or are you just going
to indolently scowl at me

06:59.711 --> 07:01.588
while I'm trapped in your cage?

07:03.966 --> 07:05.592
I'm just an assassin.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.345
But I'll tell you what...

07:09.346 --> 07:13.058
I'm starting to get a feeling
this will all end badly.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.243
I'm sorry.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.661
I failed.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.998
It went wrong. I, um...

07:36.999 --> 07:39.876
I dropped the wand,
but I'm gonna make it right.

07:39.877 --> 07:41.836
I just... I dropped the wand,

07:41.837 --> 07:43.296
but I just need another shot,

07:43.297 --> 07:44.964
another chance,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.300
and I swear I will get Dirk Gently.

07:47.301 --> 07:48.885
I'll get The Boy.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.636
It doesn't matter.

07:52.014 --> 07:53.514
Are you all right?

07:54.892 --> 07:56.602
See for yourself.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.528
Wait, is that
supposed to be you?

08:07.446 --> 08:09.113
I suppose
I always suspected

08:09.114 --> 08:11.325
there was something
wrong with my world.

08:12.034 --> 08:16.455
Even as I took it over,
it felt <i>off</i> somehow, you know?

08:18.207 --> 08:20.541
Um, I don't...

08:20.542 --> 08:22.711
This is just a picture.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.506
Just a picture?

08:27.674 --> 08:28.841
Look there.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.843
This is the Battle of Star Rock.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.054
This is the first kingdom
that I conquered.

08:33.055 --> 08:35.932
And here, there's the war
for Knick-Knack Highlands!

08:35.933 --> 08:38.893
And this is the ambush
at Marshmallow Mountains.

08:38.894 --> 08:40.061
So?

08:40.062 --> 08:42.522
All of these are battles
that I won easily.

08:42.523 --> 08:45.066
There's no way anyone
could know all these details!

08:45.067 --> 08:48.612
I've killed everyone in my world
who could tell these stories.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.699
And yet,
these drawings show them all,

08:53.700 --> 08:57.329
with one difference... I lose.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.748
Every time.

09:00.749 --> 09:02.625
Don't you see?

09:02.626 --> 09:04.670
This is how it was meant to be.

09:05.379 --> 09:06.712
I'm just a...

09:06.713 --> 09:09.757
just a puppet.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.176
Just a "bad guy."

09:13.762 --> 09:15.805
The person who did this

09:15.806 --> 09:20.269
must be The Boy of the prophecy,
and Dirk Gently's already found him!

09:26.733 --> 09:28.734
If I return...

09:28.735 --> 09:31.612
to Wendimoor...

09:31.613 --> 09:33.031
I'll be defeated.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.287
All this time, I was built to lose...

09:39.288 --> 09:41.123
by a child.

09:43.125 --> 09:44.960
Do you know where The Boy is?

09:47.421 --> 09:49.298
And... what?

09:50.340 --> 09:52.800
You're just giving up?

09:52.801 --> 09:54.677
You're just gonna, what...

09:54.678 --> 09:56.679
let him live?

09:56.680 --> 09:59.265
All because of some
stupid kid's drawing

09:59.266 --> 10:00.808
in a weird old crackhouse,

10:00.809 --> 10:02.560
you're all sulky and depressed.

10:02.561 --> 10:04.938
No! Uh-uh.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.191
You told me

10:09.192 --> 10:12.111
I was gonna be a queen.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.946
A queen!

10:13.947 --> 10:16.907
I'm sorry, Mr. Mage,
but this isn't over.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.075
Not by a long shot.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.910
I'm gonna finish this myself!

10:19.911 --> 10:20.953
You watch your tongue, you impudent...

10:20.954 --> 10:23.706
Or what? Hmm?

10:23.707 --> 10:25.625
Do you see me in your stupid drawing?

10:25.626 --> 10:29.712
You may think that
you're some kind of fantasy...

10:29.713 --> 10:32.465
but I'm real!

10:32.466 --> 10:34.718
I am real!

10:36.219 --> 10:39.513
No. I'm sorry, I've never
seen this woman before.

10:39.514 --> 10:40.556
You said she had a wand?

10:40.557 --> 10:42.224
Or something, yes.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.225
It was a wand.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.352
It was definitely a magic wand.

10:44.353 --> 10:45.436
Let's bite that bullet.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.271
Perhaps she was there to help.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.648
You said she cast a love spell?

10:48.649 --> 10:50.608
She did not look like
she wanted to help, okay?

10:50.609 --> 10:52.818
She was headed right for Dirk.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.072
Dirk, do you think Suzie Boreton
got it from Wendimoor?

10:56.073 --> 10:57.239
Maybe she's been to Wendimoor.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.075
Maybe that's
how Amanda got there.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.701
Bit of a logical leap there, Todd.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.995
Look, we should be
just trying to finish this,

11:02.996 --> 11:05.790
before anything else happens,
not getting hung up on details.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.333
- "Details"?
- Ooh! Ooh, ooh, ooh.

11:07.334 --> 11:11.170
Maybe Wendimoor's
always existed, somehow,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.381
and Arnold Cardenas
is the guy who found it,

11:13.382 --> 11:16.133
and then his parents...
murdered each other,

11:16.134 --> 11:18.135
and the government
locked it down?

11:18.136 --> 11:19.553
Then why is this all happening now?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.847
The prophecy was spoken ages ago.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.140
What could've set it into motion?

11:23.141 --> 11:24.850
Ooh! Ooh! That's one of those...

11:24.851 --> 11:27.144
That is a good question, man.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.021
Why have we not been
talking to this guy sooner?

11:29.022 --> 11:31.732
I am pro-this guy, now.
I am Team Poncho!

11:31.733 --> 11:32.692
"Panto."

11:32.693 --> 11:35.736
I don't understand how
Suzie Boreton's involved.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.447
Is she under some kind
of spell too, or...?

11:38.448 --> 11:39.865
Wait...

11:39.866 --> 11:41.534
The prophecy...

11:41.535 --> 11:42.660
The prophecy!

11:42.661 --> 11:43.870
- What?
- What?

11:44.454 --> 11:45.788
In the prophecy,

11:45.789 --> 11:46.914
didn't you say

11:46.915 --> 11:48.916
the dark wizard would
find an apprentice?

11:48.917 --> 11:50.501
Isn't that how it all started?

11:50.502 --> 11:55.631
Look, isn't it probable, possible,
indeed very likely,

11:55.632 --> 11:57.967
and, in fact, almost certain

11:57.968 --> 12:00.803
that Suzie Boreton
met this Mage person,

12:00.804 --> 12:03.848
and is, for some reason,
in league with him?

12:03.849 --> 12:08.269
You're saying Suzie Boreton
is, what, some kind of witch?

12:08.270 --> 12:10.896
Yeah, like
a crappy junior witch, right?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.440
I don't think the "love spell"
or whatever

12:12.441 --> 12:13.441
was an intentional move.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.608
I think it was a mistake.

12:14.609 --> 12:16.193
She looked like
she wanted to hurt us.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.237
I... I think Bob Boreton
was enchanted too.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.697
I think that's why he attacked us.

12:19.698 --> 12:22.408
This man, The Mage,
must've got here first,

12:22.409 --> 12:23.993
before Panto.

12:23.994 --> 12:25.870
I... If he knows
the prophecy you told us

12:25.871 --> 12:28.289
about saving Wendimoor,
he'd know my name,

12:28.290 --> 12:30.959
that I'd "bring The Boy"
who would stop him...

12:33.211 --> 12:35.254
He'd want to kill me.

12:37.591 --> 12:40.218
The Mage is a cruel, sadistic monster.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.887
He's destroyed most of my world

12:42.888 --> 12:44.890
just for the sake
of his own amusement.

12:46.641 --> 12:48.017
If you're correct,

12:48.018 --> 12:50.102
and The Mage is here,

12:50.103 --> 12:52.814
or has an agent in your world...

12:54.608 --> 12:57.569
then I'm afraid you're
all in grave danger.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.657
There's a way to find out.

13:03.033 --> 13:05.284
Farah, if you find the clothes
you were wearing last night,

13:05.285 --> 13:06.870
you'll find
Scott Boreton's phone.

13:18.423 --> 13:19.340
Hello?

13:19.341 --> 13:22.259
Suzie Boreton?
This is Deputy Tina Tevetino.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.219
I'm afraid to tell you

13:23.220 --> 13:25.221
Scott's gotten himself
into some trouble again.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.059
You don't say.

13:29.518 --> 13:33.062
It's not a class-one felony,
uh, but I have had to hold him.

13:33.063 --> 13:36.148
He's saying a lot of stuff
about a "mage" or something,

13:36.149 --> 13:38.276
I don't know, was hoping
you could clear some things up.

13:38.777 --> 13:40.779
<i>Why are you lying to me, Tina?</i>

13:42.155 --> 13:43.113
Uh...

13:43.114 --> 13:46.493
You don't understand
who you're antagonizing.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.245
<i>You have no idea
what I could do to you.</i>

13:49.246 --> 13:51.622
Well, Suzie...

13:51.623 --> 13:53.290
I feel like you're threatening
me right now, so that's...

13:53.291 --> 13:55.502
You people embarrassed me!

13:56.419 --> 13:58.379
You laughed at me.

13:58.380 --> 14:00.214
You were dancing and having fun

14:00.215 --> 14:02.383
<i>while I was crawling
on the ground...</i>

14:02.384 --> 14:04.218
Uh, we didn't...

14:04.219 --> 14:06.011
I was just trying
to do something for myself,

14:06.012 --> 14:08.097
just kill one person,

14:08.098 --> 14:11.476
<i>and now I have mud in my hair!</i>

14:12.769 --> 14:15.563
You think I'm going to let
people make me feel small again?

14:15.564 --> 14:17.565
I am done feeling small.

14:17.566 --> 14:19.358
Nuh-uh.

14:19.359 --> 14:23.362
You know how much bullshit
I've had to deal with?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.906
Well, not anymore.

14:25.866 --> 14:29.285
No, I won't let
your negative attitude

14:29.286 --> 14:31.328
drag me down.

14:31.329 --> 14:33.372
I will cover myself

14:33.373 --> 14:34.916
in your blood!

14:36.501 --> 14:38.879
<i>I have high self-esteem.</i>

14:40.547 --> 14:42.089
I am...

14:42.090 --> 14:44.009
magnificent.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.638
And I'm going to kill all of you!

14:55.979 --> 14:58.899
I think it's time
you gave me my gun back.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.615
Well...

15:07.616 --> 15:10.492
your first error was letting Priest
use his own guys.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.411
Right. I-I see that.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.913
And your second error...

15:13.914 --> 15:15.331
Can we not... list my errors?

15:15.332 --> 15:17.166
- There are a lot.
- I know.

15:17.167 --> 15:18.417
There are, like, a lot of errors.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.376
I know!

15:19.377 --> 15:22.212
Like, there are errors, and then,

15:22.213 --> 15:24.423
nothing else... only errors.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.093
Ugh! Can you get
the Rowdy Three back?

15:28.637 --> 15:32.515
Our priority should be
what's happening in Bergsberg.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.516
But it doesn't make any sense

15:34.517 --> 15:36.185
that there wasn't any police response

15:36.186 --> 15:37.854
to what happened at the motel.

15:38.813 --> 15:40.940
Priest is still there, right?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.067
Have him ping the GPS trackers

15:43.068 --> 15:44.985
in the Bergsberg Sheriff
Department vehicles.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.612
Let's find out where they are.

15:46.613 --> 15:49.198
What would be the point of that?

15:49.199 --> 15:50.617
Well, everything is connect...

15:52.077 --> 15:54.621
You really still don't get
how this works, do you?

15:57.290 --> 15:58.375
Like, no!

16:05.215 --> 16:06.340
Could I talk to Mr. Priest?

16:06.341 --> 16:09.802
Well, I mean, he just ignores
everything I say,

16:09.803 --> 16:11.638
so, like... sure.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.101
You know I'm gonna need
a higher clearance for that.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.603
Of course.

16:23.108 --> 16:24.441
I want that square head!

16:24.442 --> 16:26.694
They're all square. Cubes.

16:26.695 --> 16:28.529
These things are so dumb, and I love it!

16:28.530 --> 16:29.905
It's "The Bad Cube Gang"!

16:29.906 --> 16:31.323
Mm. Canadian-made.

16:31.324 --> 16:32.825
That's a nice hat there, drummer.

16:32.826 --> 16:33.867
I just don't trust cubes.

16:33.868 --> 16:35.411
There's too many dimensions.

16:35.412 --> 16:36.787
It's confusing!

16:36.788 --> 16:38.748
Are you gonna tell us
how you did that trick?

16:39.290 --> 16:41.292
How you sucked us
through the floor like that?

16:43.503 --> 16:44.545
I don't know, Martin.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.088
I'm...

16:46.089 --> 16:47.256
I'm still learning.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.757
Mmm.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.009
But I'm happy to see you.

16:50.010 --> 16:51.177
Mm-hmm.

16:52.429 --> 16:54.680
You know, I been around a long time.

16:54.681 --> 16:59.226
I seen a lot of wild-style bamboo,
but those furry monsters,

16:59.227 --> 17:01.437
it's new to me.

17:01.438 --> 17:03.147
You have truly upped my limit.

17:03.148 --> 17:05.774
I'm just going with the flow right now.

17:05.775 --> 17:08.152
Trying to not ask too many questions.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.571
Hey, drummer! One of the Martians
is touching me again!

17:10.572 --> 17:11.905
Vogel, we've been through this!

17:11.906 --> 17:13.407
This is not Mars.

17:13.408 --> 17:14.908
But it might be Canada.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.035
It's not Canada, Cross.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.327
That guy's Canadian!

17:17.328 --> 17:18.245
We are in the woods right now!

17:18.246 --> 17:19.413
That's Canada!

17:19.414 --> 17:21.708
Like I said... you've upped my limit.

17:23.168 --> 17:24.878
I'm gonna figure out
how to get us home.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.215
Is that the plan?

17:30.216 --> 17:31.801
I mean, we just got here, right?

17:33.261 --> 17:35.429
I thought she was teaching you stuff.

17:35.430 --> 17:36.890
She is, yeah.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.059
But...

17:40.060 --> 17:41.436
Don't you guys...

17:42.479 --> 17:44.230
I thought you would want to leave.

17:46.441 --> 17:49.318
No, drummer.

17:49.319 --> 17:50.486
You're in charge.

17:50.487 --> 17:51.528
I'm in charge?

17:51.529 --> 17:54.031
Where you go, we go.

17:54.032 --> 17:56.283
Hell, you dragged us out of that pit.

17:56.284 --> 17:59.412
And you think we would
just wanna walk away?

18:01.247 --> 18:04.542
If you wanna learn magic,
learn that weird crap.

18:06.377 --> 18:08.713
We ain't got no place to be
but here for you.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.681
Guys, this is a mess.

18:19.682 --> 18:22.476
I just checked the station voicemail,
and there are nine messages saying

18:22.477 --> 18:24.686
that the motel's all shot up,
like the Wild West,

18:24.687 --> 18:28.690
and government trucks coming through,
and drones in the sky,

18:28.691 --> 18:32.194
and weird encrypted messages
using secure channels?

18:32.195 --> 18:33.070
Blackwing.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.655
This is bad.

18:34.656 --> 18:37.658
And Hobbs isn't picking up his phone,
and he always picks up his phone,

18:37.659 --> 18:40.911
and I checked my stupid voicemail, and...

18:40.912 --> 18:42.079
It was on silent,

18:42.080 --> 18:43.747
and I got a message
from him last night.

18:43.748 --> 18:45.082
He was over at the Cardenas',

18:45.083 --> 18:46.166
and something was happening,

18:46.167 --> 18:49.628
and he... he was amped.
You know, nervous?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.505
Hobbs is never nervous.

18:51.506 --> 18:54.007
And I...

18:54.008 --> 18:56.635
Farah, uh, uh, what's...
what's our next move?

18:56.636 --> 18:58.929
Do we...
Do we wait for him here, or...

18:58.930 --> 19:00.472
We can't stay here, Tina.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.640
We should go to the Cardenas house.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.641
That's where the portal is hidden,

19:02.642 --> 19:03.642
that's how we get to Wendimoor,

19:03.643 --> 19:05.060
and that's where Hobbs said he was!

19:05.061 --> 19:05.894
No!

19:05.895 --> 19:06.937
That's where Hobbs said he was.

19:06.938 --> 19:10.274
We've got no guarantee
where, or even if, he is.

19:10.275 --> 19:13.819
You are all now actively in danger,

19:13.820 --> 19:16.781
and that's my fault, so...

19:23.580 --> 19:25.081
You know what?

19:26.332 --> 19:29.377
Actually... I've finished the case.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.129
I've done as Mona asked.

19:32.130 --> 19:33.714
<i>I've found The Boy.</i>

19:33.715 --> 19:35.132
But Wendimoor...

19:35.133 --> 19:36.258
Mona didn't say
anything about Wendimoor.

19:36.259 --> 19:37.384
May not even be real.

19:37.385 --> 19:39.094
According to you,
Mona barely said anything.

19:39.095 --> 19:41.263
We've seen Panto, Amanda,
magic wands...

19:41.264 --> 19:42.806
Then we go to the hospital.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.142
If anyone can put all this to rest

19:45.143 --> 19:48.562
and stop any more of this nonsense
leading to anyone else getting hurt,

19:48.563 --> 19:50.564
it's Arnold Cardenas.

19:50.565 --> 19:53.192
Finishing the case
is our way out of this.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.903
The hospital is our only
useful destination.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.989
Arnold is the only one
who knows what actually happened

19:58.990 --> 20:01.200
in that house all those years ago
that caused all this.

20:01.201 --> 20:04.036
He is male,
he, at one point, was a child,

20:04.037 --> 20:07.247
and he damn near shat himself
when he saw Panto.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.457
Good enough for me.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.000
Clap-clap!

20:10.001 --> 20:13.170
He is The Boy!
He has to be The Boy!

20:13.171 --> 20:14.963
He's a boy who went
into a magical painting

20:14.964 --> 20:16.381
or opened a door to another universe

20:16.382 --> 20:18.008
where, I guess,
the Purple People-Eater lived,

20:18.009 --> 20:19.092
or some stupid thing,

20:19.093 --> 20:20.427
and yes, that makes no sense,

20:20.428 --> 20:23.388
and I don't know how to connect it to Mona
or anything else, but who cares?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.598
Me? No!

20:24.599 --> 20:25.807
'Cause guess what?

20:25.808 --> 20:28.602
Snap-snap. I'm calling it!

20:28.603 --> 20:30.145
<i>Case over.</i>

20:30.146 --> 20:32.189
<i>We get him, he shows us to Wendimoor,</i>

20:32.190 --> 20:33.857
prophecy fulfilled!

20:33.858 --> 20:36.109
Mona is involved in some way,
I'm sure,

20:36.110 --> 20:38.654
and mystery solved,
solved all over the place.

20:38.655 --> 20:41.740
Done. Done!

20:41.741 --> 20:45.285
<i>I'll "find The Boy," what,
six times in a row if I have to!</i>

20:45.286 --> 20:46.662
Done! Did it!

20:46.663 --> 20:48.664
I'll point at him. "Did it!"

20:48.665 --> 20:50.791
That's my new thing.
"Did it!"

20:53.586 --> 20:55.379
Is he okay?

20:55.380 --> 20:57.297
Honestly?

20:57.298 --> 20:58.548
No clue.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.467
But the sooner we get to the hospital,
the better.

21:00.468 --> 21:01.885
I'm gonna get the air gun.

21:01.886 --> 21:03.387
Oh, no. No, no, Todd.

21:03.388 --> 21:04.680
Are you sure that you need that?

21:04.681 --> 21:06.015
Wh... Todd?

21:10.019 --> 21:11.938
Hello, Icarus.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.949
Whosever idea
it was to track the cop cars,

21:23.950 --> 21:25.784
buy that guy a donut.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.753
I can't.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.589
I can't. It's too much.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.384
Could we take a break?
Could we just take, like, I don't know, five?

21:42.385 --> 21:46.179
The pool is just a stepping stone, a tool.

21:46.180 --> 21:51.852
If you can learn to control your visions,
you can learn to control your reality.

21:51.853 --> 21:54.146
You've already used it before.

21:54.147 --> 21:56.023
Yeah. You helped me.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.525
If I try to do it again, I'll have an attack.

21:58.526 --> 21:59.693
Then have one!

21:59.694 --> 22:01.111
What?

22:01.112 --> 22:03.238
How can you say that?
You know that it hurts!

22:03.239 --> 22:04.406
How do you feel?

22:04.407 --> 22:06.074
- Angry.
- Why are you angry?

22:06.075 --> 22:07.409
'Cause I'm afraid!

22:07.410 --> 22:11.121
Fear is just a thing...
like anything else.

22:11.122 --> 22:15.208
A feeling that exists inside of you.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.795
I thought you were punk.

22:19.964 --> 22:21.631
I am punk.

22:21.632 --> 22:22.507
Screw you!

22:28.639 --> 22:30.807
Oh! I'm having an attack!

22:30.808 --> 22:33.185
There's a knife in my hand!

22:33.186 --> 22:35.812
I see it. You are in control.

22:35.813 --> 22:37.022
Stay calm.

22:37.023 --> 22:40.192
Separate from reality.
Go to the place within.

22:40.193 --> 22:42.944
The physical world is just
something you experience with your body.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.614
Your body is a collection
of meat and blood and bone.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.657
Your awareness can separate.

22:47.658 --> 22:48.658
Separate!

22:48.659 --> 22:50.660
The knife is just an illusion, your illusion.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.704
Own it! Control it!

22:52.705 --> 22:55.457
Make it your reality!

23:03.424 --> 23:05.676
Oh, shit!

23:07.512 --> 23:11.765
It's over...
but the knife is real!

23:11.766 --> 23:13.809
I created the knife.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.269
I am a freakin' witch-a-koo-koo!

23:24.570 --> 23:25.779
Hey, Tina.

23:25.780 --> 23:26.988
"Wacky T"!

23:26.989 --> 23:28.657
I've never seen you this far east.

23:28.658 --> 23:30.826
I heard you became a cop.

23:30.827 --> 23:32.786
And working with Hobbs, no less.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.413
I, uh...

23:34.414 --> 23:36.374
Oh, hiya... Rizzio!

23:37.708 --> 23:39.084
Marnie!

23:39.085 --> 23:41.628
Marnie Fee from over
there in Great Falls.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.588
Oh. Uh, yeah. Hi.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.258
Hiya. Did you conversate
with Hobbs recently?

23:46.259 --> 23:47.384
I've been trying to reach him.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.552
Yeah. Me too, actually.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.138
A shipment of guns from
Great Falls was stolen.

23:51.139 --> 23:52.180
Oh.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.557
- Yeah.
- Ya don't say?

23:53.558 --> 23:56.184
Suspects went poof, into thin air,
but get this...

23:56.185 --> 23:57.436
we found out whoever paid them

23:57.437 --> 23:59.563
used gold bars
with big "K"s on them,

23:59.564 --> 24:01.148
like something out of a fairytale.

24:01.149 --> 24:02.274
The Mage.

24:02.275 --> 24:04.943
We have to go. Now.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.404
Sure... Sure. Bye, Tina!

24:07.405 --> 24:09.656
Uh, good to see you...

24:09.657 --> 24:11.075
Marnie.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.547
Whoever you are,
get out of here.

24:25.548 --> 24:29.509
Oh, no... I'm Dirk Gently.
Remember?

24:29.510 --> 24:30.719
I was told to find you

24:30.720 --> 24:33.013
by a woman
named Mona Wilder.

24:33.014 --> 24:34.431
Do you know who that is?

24:35.725 --> 24:37.309
No.

24:37.310 --> 24:38.185
<i>Leave me alone.</i>

24:38.186 --> 24:39.769
Yes. You said

24:39.770 --> 24:41.146
"the house within a house"

24:41.147 --> 24:43.607
and the air gun
were made for you.

24:43.608 --> 24:46.026
By whom?
Who made them?

24:46.027 --> 24:47.778
Someone in Wendimoor?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.447
Do you know how
to get there?

24:50.448 --> 24:52.950
Wendimoor can't be real.

24:54.368 --> 24:58.038
If it is...
I'll never be forgiven.

24:58.039 --> 24:59.415
Forgiven by who?

25:04.837 --> 25:08.381
My parents
were always fighting...

25:08.382 --> 25:09.591
over money...

25:09.592 --> 25:11.802
the motel, the farm.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.890
<i>A company called "Kellum"
wanted to buy our land.</i>

25:16.891 --> 25:18.893
<i>My mother wanted to sell...</i>

25:20.311 --> 25:24.315
...but my papi, he wanted to stay.

25:25.983 --> 25:30.320
The fighting
got worse and worse.

25:30.321 --> 25:32.240
And then, one night...

25:33.533 --> 25:36.785
My mother came home
in a shiny new car...

25:36.786 --> 25:38.621
<i>Kellum had bought her.</i>

25:41.207 --> 25:43.209
The scissors...

25:44.877 --> 25:47.421
I lost both my parents in one night.

25:48.714 --> 25:50.257
Is that why you called the government?

25:50.258 --> 25:51.883
Because your mother
killed your father?

25:51.884 --> 25:54.469
What does that
have to do with Wendimoor?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.514
I thought I was
going to be taken there.

25:57.932 --> 25:59.766
It was a promise.

25:59.767 --> 26:04.271
Wendimoor would be
a safe haven...

26:04.272 --> 26:05.981
but it can't exist.

26:05.982 --> 26:08.234
Well, if it does,
can you take us there?

26:09.527 --> 26:10.778
Maybe...

26:12.989 --> 26:14.407
Yes.

26:15.783 --> 26:17.076
Then put your shoes on.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.996
We're going to another dimension.

26:24.584 --> 26:25.625
<i>Priest.</i>

26:25.626 --> 26:27.043
<i>Update.</i>

26:27.044 --> 26:29.004
This is not Supervisor Friedkin.

26:29.005 --> 26:30.839
To whom am I speaking?

26:30.840 --> 26:32.090
Uh, no, it's cool.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.675
I'm still in charge,

26:33.676 --> 26:36.470
but my friend Ken here knows Dirk...

26:38.931 --> 26:41.099
<i>Update, please?</i>

26:41.100 --> 26:43.435
Interesting.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.605
The subject and accomplices
have entered the hospital.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.275
There's no sign of any activity yet.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.985
<i>Let us know if anything changes.</i>

26:51.986 --> 26:55.322
<i>Otherwise, hold back. Your team is en route.</i>

27:00.578 --> 27:03.997
Things appear to be getting
a bit more interestin' here.

27:03.998 --> 27:06.958
<i>I have an unknown female</i>

27:06.959 --> 27:09.210
<i>approaching the premises</i>

27:09.211 --> 27:10.754
<i>looking...</i>

27:10.755 --> 27:12.381
sorta...

27:14.091 --> 27:15.175
...nuts.

27:18.095 --> 27:19.722
What is up with her?

27:21.223 --> 27:22.558
Excuse me?

27:23.476 --> 27:24.851
Can I help you?

27:29.065 --> 27:30.232
Drop your weapon!

27:39.075 --> 27:41.785
Things are getting distinctly
supernatural around here.

27:41.786 --> 27:44.579
<i>Bursts of light coming from inside.</i>

27:44.580 --> 27:46.247
It might be time...

27:46.248 --> 27:47.791
for me to move in.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.959
<i>Find Project Icarus!</i>

27:49.960 --> 27:51.419
But stay back,

27:51.420 --> 27:53.046
unless the subjects are in danger.

27:53.047 --> 27:55.215
I don't want any subjects hurt,

27:55.216 --> 27:56.091
<i>you hear me?</i>

27:56.092 --> 27:57.092
Yeah, I got that.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.303
What about the civilians
and accomplices?

28:00.888 --> 28:02.848
Project Icarus is the priority.

28:03.766 --> 28:04.849
Oh.

28:04.850 --> 28:06.226
I like you, Ken.

28:07.520 --> 28:09.270
<i>Attention, all staff.</i>

28:09.271 --> 28:11.564
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

28:11.565 --> 28:14.859
<i>A controlled hospital lockdown
is now in effect.</i>

28:14.860 --> 28:17.737
<i>Please enter the nearest room
and lock the doors.</i>

28:19.949 --> 28:21.117
Hey! Freeze!

28:24.078 --> 28:25.495
Shit's going down.

28:25.496 --> 28:27.289
It's Suzie Boreton. It has to be.

28:27.415 --> 28:28.498
This is all my fault.

28:28.499 --> 28:30.333
We need to get Arnold out of here.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.377
I betrayed him.

28:32.378 --> 28:33.503
We need to go, now!

28:34.630 --> 28:36.006
Go, go, go, go.

28:39.051 --> 28:41.136
Where the hell
is she coming from?

28:41.137 --> 28:42.138
I don't know.

28:57.319 --> 28:58.362
Whoa!

29:00.990 --> 29:02.824
Give me The Boy!

29:02.825 --> 29:04.409
Tina, cover!

29:04.410 --> 29:05.411
Huh...

29:22.178 --> 29:23.721
Oh, for...

29:26.724 --> 29:28.392
Oh, that's so bad!

29:28.559 --> 29:29.560
Tina!

29:30.519 --> 29:31.561
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God!

29:41.280 --> 29:43.449
No. No!

29:45.785 --> 29:46.826
What about Tina?

29:46.827 --> 29:48.828
She's not after her!
She's after us!

30:00.508 --> 30:02.217
Oh, uh, this way!

30:02.218 --> 30:04.010
We need to find another way.

30:04.011 --> 30:05.304
No, Arnold, just trust us.

30:06.889 --> 30:08.015
Stand back!

30:15.105 --> 30:16.523
Arnold?

30:22.530 --> 30:23.696
Arnold!

30:23.697 --> 30:25.532
Well, hello there.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.616
Who're you?

30:26.617 --> 30:28.410
- No!
- Come on, let's go!

30:29.203 --> 30:31.079
Wouldn't you like to know?

30:31.080 --> 30:33.415
Toros!

30:40.756 --> 30:42.507
<i>Priest! Status!</i>

30:42.508 --> 30:44.760
Things... got a little zany.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.435
Goddammit, baby.

30:54.436 --> 30:55.855
I miss Blackwing.

31:02.486 --> 31:03.486
It's gonna be okay, Dirk.

31:03.487 --> 31:06.072
It most certainly is not.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.448
We'll... We'll figure it out.

31:07.449 --> 31:08.449
We... we have to get out of here.

31:08.450 --> 31:09.492
We'll regroup. We'll...

31:09.493 --> 31:10.493
There's nowhere to go.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.331
And The Boy is dead.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.251
So there's no regrouping.

31:20.754 --> 31:21.713
Let's go!

31:21.714 --> 31:22.923
Now!

31:24.592 --> 31:25.884
Whose car is this?

31:25.885 --> 31:27.886
They won't miss it.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.283
I can't believe that finally worked.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.744
What did you see?

31:53.537 --> 31:55.455
People I know.

31:55.456 --> 31:56.706
People I don't know.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.709
I saw Dirk,
I saw my brother's guitar.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.169
I saw, um...

32:01.170 --> 32:02.546
Could you see this stuff?

32:03.088 --> 32:05.089
No.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.925
I can't see into
your realm on my own.

32:06.926 --> 32:08.468
I made a friend.

32:08.469 --> 32:10.346
I use her eyes.

32:12.514 --> 32:14.058
What else did you see?

32:14.433 --> 32:16.684
I saw something bad coming.

32:16.685 --> 32:18.394
There was an army.

32:18.395 --> 32:20.980
Like those box-head...
the Kellum knight guys.

32:20.981 --> 32:22.315
And there was
thousands of them,

32:22.316 --> 32:23.900
and they were coming here.

32:23.901 --> 32:27.695
So what happens
when this army gets here?

32:27.696 --> 32:30.949
If the army is
as close as you've seen,

32:30.950 --> 32:33.035
that is very bad indeed.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.538
Evil will win.

32:37.623 --> 32:39.166
Everyone will die.

32:45.881 --> 32:47.967
Uh, you're not talking anymore.

32:49.593 --> 32:50.844
Don't you understand?

32:51.637 --> 32:54.806
They left us food because
they know they might not be back.

32:54.807 --> 32:57.142
They are facing grave peril.

33:00.521 --> 33:02.939
You have to let me out of here.

33:02.940 --> 33:03.815
We can take my weapons

33:03.816 --> 33:05.525
and disguise ourselves
in garb of this world.

33:05.526 --> 33:08.820
- I told you that we can't--
- No! You have to let me out.

33:08.821 --> 33:10.863
If The Mage is here,
it changes everything.

33:10.864 --> 33:12.907
<i>I have to go back to Wendimoor.</i>

33:12.908 --> 33:14.450
If my family's fate is to die,

33:14.451 --> 33:17.286
then I shall die
fighting as hard as I can by their sides.

33:17.287 --> 33:20.039
Wait. You know how to get back?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.417
You known this whole time?

33:22.167 --> 33:23.252
Yes.

33:24.586 --> 33:26.295
Then why didn't you tell Dirk?

33:26.296 --> 33:28.339
Because he didn't have The Boy.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.383
I didn't know who to trust.

33:30.384 --> 33:31.300
And now I can see

33:31.301 --> 33:33.011
you're the only person
who can help me.

33:33.012 --> 33:34.387
Yeah, but if your cell don't unlock,

33:34.388 --> 33:36.723
that means the universe
don't want you to get out, so I can't...

33:36.724 --> 33:38.558
Forget fate!
Forget the universe!

33:38.559 --> 33:41.310
Forget magic and mystery
and prophecies and all of it!

33:41.311 --> 33:43.396
You said you wanted control!

33:43.397 --> 33:44.605
<i>You can retrieve my scissor sword</i>

33:44.606 --> 33:45.940
<i>and break this lock.</i>

33:45.941 --> 33:48.443
Yeah, but...

33:48.444 --> 33:49.569
I'm not supposed to...

33:49.570 --> 33:52.238
I am fighting
for a happily-ever-after.

33:52.239 --> 33:55.158
<i>Do you want to help me
save the people I love?</i>

33:55.159 --> 33:57.869
Do you want to come with me
to Wendimoor?

33:57.870 --> 34:01.123
Or would you rather stay here
and let fate play out for you?

34:03.000 --> 34:05.084
What is it that you want?

34:12.217 --> 34:14.719
Dirk, I know that was bad,
but are you gonna be okay?

34:14.720 --> 34:16.346
Come on, Dirk. We need you, okay?

34:17.681 --> 34:19.932
Um, I-I've never seen him like...

34:19.933 --> 34:20.934
I know.

34:21.643 --> 34:22.602
Well, where we going?

34:22.603 --> 34:24.021
Out of Bergsberg.

34:27.441 --> 34:29.108
Screw this.
Everything's imploding.

34:29.109 --> 34:30.068
Go to the Cardenas house.

34:30.069 --> 34:31.360
I'm going to get my sister.

34:31.361 --> 34:32.820
You don't know where she is.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.614
Amanda's in Wendimoor!
I saw her!

34:34.615 --> 34:37.158
Todd, you had
a hallucination, okay?

34:37.159 --> 34:38.117
You don't know that that was real.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.495
It's the only place left!

35:02.768 --> 35:04.102
What's shaking?

35:04.103 --> 35:06.104
Yeah, why are you so twisted up?

35:06.105 --> 35:09.441
I think something...
really bad is coming.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.485
The visions are weird.

35:12.486 --> 35:14.946
But I need you to see
if it's, like, literal, or a metaphor.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.199
I need you to go south.

35:18.200 --> 35:22.620
Use your magic smell thing
to see if there's a giant army coming.

35:22.621 --> 35:24.789
Look, I know this world is weird

35:24.790 --> 35:25.623
and dangerous,

35:25.624 --> 35:27.291
and there's no telling
what you might run into...

35:27.292 --> 35:28.377
Stop.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.504
It's done.

35:31.672 --> 35:33.005
This is gonna be fun.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.094
Let's go, boys.

35:51.441 --> 35:52.985
Dirk! With me!

35:55.154 --> 35:56.737
Dirk. Come on. Get up.

35:56.738 --> 35:58.489
Fine. Guess it's just you and me, Farah.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.033
Wendimoor, here we come.

36:04.288 --> 36:05.706
Oh, that can't be good.

36:07.374 --> 36:08.750
I'm out of ammunition.

36:09.877 --> 36:11.252
Get Dirk inside.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.504
What... What about you?

36:13.380 --> 36:14.631
Farah!

36:17.342 --> 36:19.219
Dirk, stand up!

36:20.179 --> 36:21.596
We don't have The Boy.

36:21.597 --> 36:23.097
We failed the case.

36:23.098 --> 36:25.433
There's nowhere to go.
It's all pointless, isn't it?

36:25.434 --> 36:26.559
Maybe I'm The Boy. Right?

36:26.560 --> 36:28.478
Come on. At least we gotta try.

36:40.240 --> 36:42.742
Okay, Panto arrived on this bed,

36:42.743 --> 36:45.704
so it must somehow
turn into a portal.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.172
Could really use your help here.

36:56.173 --> 36:57.757
This is kind of your specialty...

36:57.758 --> 37:00.844
finding strange handles
and switches that do weird stuff.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.516
Right, so, Panto described it

37:07.517 --> 37:10.145
almost like he fell onto the bed, so...

37:11.980 --> 37:12.980
Oh! Yes!

37:12.981 --> 37:15.108
Of course!
I have to fall onto the bed!

37:28.997 --> 37:30.374
Farah Black!

37:31.917 --> 37:34.961
It's so lovely to make
your acquaintance.

37:34.962 --> 37:37.213
Sorry to hear about your father.

37:37.214 --> 37:39.840
I'm with an agency called Blackwing...

37:39.841 --> 37:41.509
I know who you are.

37:41.510 --> 37:45.388
Good. Then you know there's no reason
for any kind of fisticuffs

37:45.389 --> 37:50.309
with all that fancy training
that your file bored me with.

37:50.310 --> 37:52.645
Oh, I think there's a need
for violence here, actually.

37:52.646 --> 37:53.771
Oh.

37:53.772 --> 37:55.232
Blow my mind.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.363
Maybe next time.

38:03.115 --> 38:04.950
Maybe the portal
is actually the ceiling!

38:06.576 --> 38:07.869
Svlad Celli...

38:08.870 --> 38:10.372
it's time to come home!

38:13.292 --> 38:15.460
<i>A lot of people died today because of you.</i>

38:15.919 --> 38:17.128
Who the hell is that?

38:17.129 --> 38:19.922
That's Priest.

38:19.923 --> 38:21.549
Farah's dead.

38:21.550 --> 38:25.720
I'm sorry, Todd,
but now you're dead too.

38:25.721 --> 38:27.013
There's no way.

38:27.014 --> 38:28.514
Farah can take anybody out.

38:28.515 --> 38:30.933
She's probably planning
a sneak attack or something.

38:30.934 --> 38:32.810
We just need to portal to Wendimoor,
save Amanda,

38:32.811 --> 38:34.145
figure out all "The Boy" stuff,

38:34.146 --> 38:35.647
and come right back,
and everything's gonna be fine!

38:36.648 --> 38:39.942
Wait. Um... I-I-If... If-if-if...

38:39.943 --> 38:42.361
If the portal to Wendimoor
is in here somewhere,

38:42.362 --> 38:45.741
then wouldn't it make sense for it
to literally be through the mural?

38:51.330 --> 38:55.082
Poor confused,
dangerous little Svlad Celli...

38:55.083 --> 38:57.418
"Dirk Gently." Project Icarus.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.378
Always in trouble.

38:59.379 --> 39:01.297
Come back to Blackwing

39:01.298 --> 39:04.383
before anyone else
dies because of you.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.885
I deserve to go back.

39:05.886 --> 39:07.386
The water stain.

39:07.387 --> 39:08.554
Remember?

39:08.555 --> 39:10.098
It's right where the bed closes.

39:11.641 --> 39:13.392
Wait.
You were wet in the trunk,

39:13.393 --> 39:16.354
and Panto arrived all wet too.

39:16.355 --> 39:17.480
Oh, my God, wait.

39:17.481 --> 39:19.273
Panto said that he fell onto a bed,

39:19.274 --> 39:21.400
but when he stood up, it was gone.

39:21.401 --> 39:23.486
The force of him traveling
between the two worlds

39:23.487 --> 39:25.029
opened and closed the bed
when he got up!

39:25.030 --> 39:27.073
The bed has to be closed!

39:27.074 --> 39:28.866
Oh, no, the door is closed.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.911
However will I get inside?

39:33.330 --> 39:34.163
Oh, no...

39:52.933 --> 39:54.643
<i>Mr. Priest? Report.</i>

39:56.186 --> 39:58.105
I'm gonna need a lockdown team.

40:07.239 --> 40:09.740
Ever since I can remember,
I've always just wanted to hurt people.

40:09.741 --> 40:10.866
It's honestly

40:10.867 --> 40:15.414
the most interesting way
to spend your time.

40:20.502 --> 40:23.672
I thought I was the most powerful person
in my stupid little world.

40:24.965 --> 40:26.383
Turns out, I'm nothing.

40:27.551 --> 40:28.968
Even my first little plan...

40:28.969 --> 40:31.011
just basic cruelty, really...

40:31.012 --> 40:32.930
take weapons from your world,
give them to people in mine,

40:32.931 --> 40:34.056
and sit back
and watch the violence.

40:34.057 --> 40:35.767
Classic sort of fun.

40:38.353 --> 40:41.189
But I was thinking small, wasn't I?

40:43.275 --> 40:47.111
There's a whole world out there.

40:47.112 --> 40:49.113
Your world.

40:50.991 --> 40:54.160
Maybe it's time
I left Wendimoor behind me.

40:54.161 --> 40:56.954
There's plenty of people
in your world to torture.

40:56.955 --> 40:58.664
Maybe Wendimoor doesn't matter.

40:58.665 --> 40:59.749
Why should it?

41:00.500 --> 41:04.086
Maybe it's time I closed those doors
once and for all.

41:05.046 --> 41:07.465
Of course, that still leaves
your deranged wife to deal with.

41:09.801 --> 41:12.344
Dirk Gently is defeated.

41:12.345 --> 41:14.556
The Boy is dead.

41:17.726 --> 41:19.352
Send me to Wendimoor.
