BROOKE: I wanna have a baby.

00:09.743 --> 00:13.611
And I realized that what I actually want
is to have a family.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.307
Carrie, what are you doing?
This is not okay.

00:15.382 --> 00:18.283
- You have to get out of here.
- It's okay, Nathan.

00:18.351 --> 00:20.342
Haley, this isn't this, okay?

00:20.420 --> 00:23.048
I want you to get the hell out
of my house right now.

00:23.123 --> 00:24.283
No, you stay away from us!

00:24.357 --> 00:25.517
This marriage is over!

00:25.592 --> 00:27.890
- Haley.
- I want a divorce.

00:27.961 --> 00:29.622
I still love you, Lucas.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.027

I'm sorry, Lucas, I can't marry you.

00:48.148 --> 00:50.673
- Jamie.
- Nanny Carrie.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.544
Jamie!

00:54.621 --> 00:56.179
Won't Mama be mad?

00:56.256 --> 01:00.784
No. Besides, I'm gonna be
your mama now.

01:02.362 --> 01:05.593
If you decide to go anywhere
near my family ever again,

01:06.332 --> 01:08.664
I'd have no problem killing you.

01:11.371 --> 01:12.429
Mama!

01:12.505 --> 01:14.439
Oh, baby, come here.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.708
Sweetie, what happened to you?
Are you okay?

01:18.778 --> 01:21.804
I'm fine. Grandpa Dan saved me.

Jamie.

I gotta go now.
You go back to your mom, okay?

I guess I still find it hard to let Jamie
out of my sight. I just...

03:13.860 --> 03:15.760
It's only been a month
since he was abducted.

03:15.828 --> 03:19.161
Is it so crazy that I would
still hear echoes from that day,

03:19.232 --> 03:21.928
that I would still be a little overprotective?

03:22.001 --> 03:26.404
PSYCHIATRIST: Protective?
Or overprotective? You said overprotective.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.136
Okay, well, you said it yourself.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.278
Identification is the first step
to recovery, right?

03:37.784 --> 03:41.049
How have things been going
since Nathan moved home?

03:41.688 --> 03:43.315
- Better.
- Better.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.457
We spent the past four sessions
discussing you and Nathan as a couple,

03:47.527 --> 03:50.394
as parents to Jamie.
Let's talk about you as individuals.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.192
Who are you, Haley?

03:52.265 --> 03:55.496
You mean, like, what do I do for a living,
or what are my hobbies, or...

03:55.568 --> 03:57.536
No. I mean, who are you?

03:58.271 --> 04:03.402
Well, my name is Brooke Davis and I own
a fashion line called Clothes Over Bro's,

04:03.476 --> 04:08.846
which, before you read too much into it,
is very boy-friendly, just clothes-friendlier.

04:10.483 --> 04:13.452
Anyway, I attended the orientation,
so I took the liberty of drawing up

04:13.519 --> 04:16.010
a statement of my financial worth,
I think you'll be very pleased with...

04:16.089 --> 04:20.082
- How old are you, Brooke?
- Twenty-two,

04:20.159 --> 04:25.290
but I lead a rather accelerated lifestyle
with the fashion line and the magazine

04:25.365 --> 04:29.165
and I did read somewhere
that 25 is the average age for women to...

04:29.235 --> 04:31.032
Do you own your own home?

04:32.071 --> 04:37.008
- Are you sexually active?
- Lately, no, but not for a lack of trying.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.240
Sorry. No.

04:43.149 --> 04:45.743
Anyway, as I said,
I have my financial statements

04:45.818 --> 04:48.480
and a copy of my medical history,
a copy of my birth certificate...

04:48.554 --> 04:50.988
- And do you drink?
- Sorry?

04:51.057 --> 04:52.718
I noticed the bar.

04:53.192 --> 04:59.563
Oh. Some. Not really.
The bar is more for my roommate.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.966
And that would be
Peyton Sawyer, correct?

05:04.804 --> 05:08.001
You should see her knock them back,
she's a champ.

05:10.343 --> 05:15.178
I mean, the boy that she loves

05:15.248 --> 05:19.048
recently almost married someone else,
and kind of went AWOL

05:19.118 --> 05:23.418
so, unlike me,
who is perfectly stable and normal,

05:24.724 --> 05:26.715
she's struggling a bit.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.593
I guess that's what happens
when you fall in love.

05:32.432 --> 05:35.367
She can move out, if it's a problem.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.097
PEYTON: My mom used to sing to me.

05:40.873 --> 05:44.036
I don't think I've ever really told
anybody that before.

05:44.110 --> 05:45.634
It was like our little secret.

05:45.712 --> 05:49.079
But every night she'd come in
and she'd tuck me in

05:49.148 --> 05:55.212
and she'd sing me something like
lullabies or album rock stuff.

05:56.823 --> 06:00.054
And then, I don't know,
after she was gone,

06:00.126 --> 06:06.361
I remember lying in bed for the first time
and just feeling silence, you know?

06:08.167 --> 06:11.933
And then realizing that
for the rest of my life it was gone.

06:12.739 --> 06:18.143
All her songs were gone and her voice
and the way it used to soothe me.

06:19.078 --> 06:20.705
Just all of it.

06:21.748 --> 06:25.013
So I guess I tried to find new songs
to fill that quiet,

06:25.685 --> 06:28.677
but none of them ever really have,
you know?

06:30.490 --> 06:37.089
Now she's gone and Mia's gone
and Luke is gone.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.562
There's just silence.

06:42.635 --> 06:44.569
There's just silence.

06:45.171 --> 06:46.661
AND Y: You hear that?

06:47.907 --> 06:53.436
- Do I hear what?
- Nothing. Silence.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.738
It's nice, huh?

06:57.683 --> 06:59.207
I guess so.

07:00.319 --> 07:02.879
Luke, you gotta get out of your head.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.219
It's been a month, mate,
you gotta let it go.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.849
Let it go?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.918
A month ago,
I had my whole life ahead of me.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.726
Second novel, basketball team,

07:12.799 --> 07:15.131
and a girl I was gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

07:15.201 --> 07:18.068
Well, you still have all those things, yeah?

07:18.137 --> 07:22.597
If I did, do you really think I would've
spent the last four weeks at sea with you?

07:23.476 --> 07:27.879
Which brings me to this,
what are you doing out here?

07:29.015 --> 07:30.482
What do you mean?

07:30.550 --> 07:32.848
Well, I mean, it's not like
we haven't loved having you,

07:32.919 --> 07:36.320
but it's time for you
to get back to your life.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.558
And that all starts with a simple question.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.390
What do you want?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.624
I want my family back.

07:45.698 --> 07:48.531
And I want Haley to trust me again.

07:49.068 --> 07:50.865
I want her to look at me
the way she used to

07:50.937 --> 07:54.236
and see a better man
than maybe I'll ever be.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.605
And then I wanna be that man.

07:56.676 --> 08:00.407
And I will be, for her and for Jamie.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.983
I want to believe in Nathan again

08:06.486 --> 08:09.580
and I want to believe
in the goodness of people.

08:10.556 --> 08:14.151
And I want my son to be safe
and I want him to be great,

08:14.227 --> 08:18.163
and I want that greatness to be seen
and appreciated.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.761
That's what I want.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.859
I want to have a family.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.763
I want to use my success to help a child

08:26.839 --> 08:29.831
who maybe never really had
a chance at all.

08:30.977 --> 08:35.277
I want to be a mom.
And I'm ready to be one, I believe that.

08:36.782 --> 08:42.778
I want to believe in it all again,
music and art, fate and love,

08:43.856 --> 08:46.324
and I want to believe
that I've made the right choices

08:46.392 --> 08:51.955
and that I'm on the right path and there's
still time to fix the mistakes I've made.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.433
And I guess I want hope.

08:56.068 --> 08:57.695
And I want Lucas.

08:57.770 --> 09:04.403
I want Lindsey. I want her to be my wife
and I just wanna go back, you know.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.412
Wanna go back to a month ago
when we were happy

09:07.480 --> 09:12.247
and life had meaning
and purpose and direction.

09:13.686 --> 09:15.210
That's what I want.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.380
Good.

09:17.156 --> 09:19.624
'Cause I have a way you can get all that.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.393
<i>BROOKE: What did you write?</i>

09:57.830 --> 09:59.730

(PHONE VIBRATING)

10:03.202 --> 10:07.605
Sorry, it's just that I kind of feel
like I'm being judged, so...

10:07.673 --> 10:10.574
You're not being judged, Brooke,
you're being evaluated.

10:10.643 --> 10:13.305
It's to help clarify your reasons
for wanting to adopt

10:13.379 --> 10:17.782
and to explore your capabilities,
maturity and emotional readiness.

10:18.417 --> 10:22.547
And does it take very long,
the whole decision-making process?

10:22.622 --> 10:25.090
No. The home-study is the last of it.

10:25.157 --> 10:28.217
So I'll know if I'm going to be a mom
by the end of this meeting?

10:28.294 --> 10:30.023
Essentially, yes.

10:30.696 --> 10:34.792
Wow. Well, how am I doing?

10:36.769 --> 10:38.862
Let's talk about your past.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.534
<i>NA THAN: My problems with my past</i>
<i>are of my own doing.</i>

10:43.609 --> 10:49.445
I'm stubborn and I have a temper and
I don't always make the best decisions.

10:50.850 --> 10:54.911
Must have been very difficult for you,
coming so close to the NBA.

10:55.221 --> 10:58.019
- Do you think about that much?
- Sometimes.

10:58.858 --> 11:03.454
Yeah. I mean, sometimes,
I wake up in the middle of the night

11:03.529 --> 11:08.762
and I walk through town,
past the school, past the gym.

11:09.769 --> 11:14.001
I can still hear the echoes, you know.

11:15.374 --> 11:17.308
You never told me that.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.908
It's not something I'm all that proud of.

11:21.914 --> 11:26.544
It's like... Look, I'm not...
I'm not good at being vulnerable.

11:27.253 --> 11:30.711
In fact, this is probably the closest
I've come to it.

11:31.157 --> 11:33.421
Well, the second closest.

11:33.492 --> 11:35.221
What's the first?

11:35.995 --> 11:38.463
When I was a junior in high school,

11:38.531 --> 11:42.262
I took some stuff to help me
with my game.

11:43.002 --> 11:46.301
Drugs. And it was a stupid thing to do.

11:47.573 --> 11:51.942
I ended up collapsing on the court
and my father was all about, you know,

11:52.011 --> 11:54.502
covering it up for the scouts.

11:54.580 --> 12:00.416
But, anyway, when I left the hospital,
I went to see Haley,

12:00.486 --> 12:02.886
because I needed to know
if she could forgive me.

12:02.955 --> 12:06.755
Wanted to see if I still had
a chance to be great in her eyes.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.956
And what she did, she forgave me.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.931
That was the moment
that everything changed for me.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.893
That was the moment
I fell in love with her.

12:19.638 --> 12:24.337
This girl who could see past
all the mistakes I've made.

12:28.881 --> 12:30.815
I don't know.

12:30.883 --> 12:36.753
I guess maybe sometimes I screw up
because I want to feel that again.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.994
Suppose that sounds pretty broken.

12:44.697 --> 12:48.724
You're not broken, Luke.
You might think that you are, but...

12:48.801 --> 12:50.632
Hey, you remember
when I left your mom the first time,

12:50.703 --> 12:52.796
to go back to New Zealand?

12:53.873 --> 12:54.897
(SIGHS)

12:54.974 --> 12:57.943
It was one of the hardest things
I've ever had to do.

12:58.010 --> 13:01.571
Because I still loved your mom,
but I knew there was a place in her heart

13:01.647 --> 13:05.344
that I would never occupy,
a place reserved for someone else.

13:07.453 --> 13:12.322
Somehow I just couldn't get past that.
This sounding familiar at all?

13:12.758 --> 13:17.286
Yeah. Yeah, she said my heart
was "conflicted."

13:17.363 --> 13:19.422
Well, here comes the good news.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.489
There wasn't a day while we were apart

13:21.567 --> 13:23.933
that I wasn't completely in love
with your mom.

13:24.003 --> 13:27.666
And all it would've taken
was for her to simply say,

13:27.740 --> 13:31.699
"I love you, I miss you,
and I need to be with you."

13:31.777 --> 13:33.904
I don't think it's that easy, Andy.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.879
Lucas, it is that easy.

13:37.116 --> 13:40.244
Lindsey needs to be convinced
that you love her.

13:41.120 --> 13:45.523
And did I mention that I have a private jet,
and New York's not too far from here?

13:46.025 --> 13:51.190
Nah. I tried calling her, Andy.
She didn't want to talk to me.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.827
All right, tell me this much.

13:53.899 --> 13:56.026
Has a day gone by since the wedding

13:56.101 --> 13:58.331
where you haven't thought about her
or wanted to see her?

13:58.404 --> 14:00.395
- Wanted her back?
- No.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.667
Then you owe it to yourself
to tell her that.

14:02.741 --> 14:04.834
You owe it to Lindsey, too.

14:05.611 --> 14:11.174
Just trust me, over time,
not knowing is way worse than to know.

14:13.252 --> 14:15.447
<i>HALEY: I think not knowing</i>
<i>is the hardest part.</i>

14:17.189 --> 14:22.422
Just not knowing
what our marriage means to Nathan,

14:22.494 --> 14:26.897
if he still wants the same things
out of our relationship that I want,

14:27.199 --> 14:31.101
if he still finds me sexy,
or if he still wants me or...

14:31.170 --> 14:32.899
How could you not know that?

14:32.972 --> 14:35.532
The name Carrie comes to mind.

14:37.576 --> 14:39.601
Why didn't you just tell me
about the flirting?

14:39.678 --> 14:42.044
- I don't know.
- Did you like it?

14:42.114 --> 14:45.777
Maybe. Maybe I just needed it.

14:45.851 --> 14:47.785
Why, because I don't flirt with you
after a long day

14:47.853 --> 14:49.980
of wrestling with high school students
and parenting our son?

14:50.055 --> 14:54.185
No. Because you don't look at me
like that anymore.

14:55.227 --> 14:57.752
And I get it, you know?

14:57.830 --> 15:00.060
I haven't been worthy of that look
from you in a long time.

15:00.132 --> 15:02.999
But God, Haley, I just... I miss that.

15:06.272 --> 15:11.005
When was the first time you felt
a sense of accomplishment, Nathan?

15:12.645 --> 15:15.580
It was... I started playing basketball.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.946
And the support of your father?

15:19.151 --> 15:21.346
When I started playing basketball.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.752
And this year, all that stopped.

15:24.690 --> 15:27.955
All the praise and adoration.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.626
At least until your nanny
started swimming naked.

15:32.064 --> 15:35.192
It's not the craziest case of transference
I've ever heard.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.758
So, what, I need to start swimming naked
for my husband's ego?

15:37.836 --> 15:43.604
No, you don't...
Haley, this is not your fault. It's not.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.907
Why not swim naked?

15:47.713 --> 15:52.514
You could try it together, might be fun.
After all, you are 22.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.944
Tell me something.
When was the last time

15:56.021 --> 16:00.890
the two of you did something
really young and foolish together?

16:01.727 --> 16:05.424
All due respect,
we have been married nearly six years,

16:05.497 --> 16:09.433
we have a son who's almost five.
We don't get to be young.

16:10.169 --> 16:14.606
Everyone gets to be young,
especially when you are.

16:25.751 --> 16:27.480
Hey, I'm here about the car for sale.

16:27.553 --> 16:31.512
It runs great, even though it's kind of old.

16:32.291 --> 16:35.089
My parents said I could finally get one.

16:35.794 --> 16:38.422
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, buddy.

16:42.368 --> 16:43.596
Okay, for the first six months,

16:43.669 --> 16:46.160
you're not to leave the state
without notifying my office.

16:46.238 --> 16:48.866
You must have a job or show
an attempt at gainful employment

16:48.941 --> 16:50.135
at least twice a week.

16:50.209 --> 16:53.303
Any legitimate employment
is normally acceptable.

16:53.379 --> 16:56.177
So, running for mayor again
doesn't count?

16:56.715 --> 17:00.048
You may obtain help with problems
concerning employment, residence,

17:00.119 --> 17:02.781
finances or other issues
that often trouble a person

17:02.855 --> 17:06.051
trying to adjust to life
upon release from prison.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.819
Take a look at that.

17:09.895 --> 17:13.830
That's a good-looking boy, huh?
That's Jamie. He's my grandson.

17:14.066 --> 17:15.157
You have kids?

17:15.233 --> 17:17.464
I'm your case manager.
This isn't <i>The View.</i>

17:17.536 --> 17:20.060
I know. I just thought you might
appreciate a little small talk.

17:20.138 --> 17:23.233
- Get to know each other, you know?
- There's no small talk.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.935
It's just I haven't spoken
to too many people in a long time.

17:26.011 --> 17:28.502
At least, none that I haven't paid to listen.

17:28.580 --> 17:31.845
This is the balance of what the state
owes you for your work detail in prison.

17:31.917 --> 17:36.286
It'll help you get situated.
Count it, sign for it, and you can go.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.657
$3,437.

17:40.225 --> 17:44.286
Seven hundred fifty bucks a year, huh?
And they say crime doesn't pay.

17:49.301 --> 17:52.566
How'd you like to make three grand
for a little small talk?

17:54.173 --> 17:58.473
So anyway, like I was saying.
He's a great kid. Smart.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.205
He's got his whole life ahead of him.

18:00.279 --> 18:02.543
The other day he looks up at me
and he says...

18:02.614 --> 18:05.242
They won't let me outside the fence.

18:05.317 --> 18:08.115
Yeah, trust me, I know the feeling.

18:08.187 --> 18:11.247
Can you really go to jail
for not cleaning your room?

18:11.323 --> 18:15.350
Nah. But the guy next to me
got 10 years for not eating his peas.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.794
- I don't believe you.
- (CHUCKLING) Good man.

18:18.864 --> 18:22.800
- How's my favorite guy?
- Okay. Except Uncle Lucas is gone.

18:23.669 --> 18:27.264
Well, I get a feeling
he'll be coming back soon.

18:27.339 --> 18:28.931
Your parents, they good?

18:29.007 --> 18:34.206
Daddy came back home, but he mostly
sleeps on the couch again, like before.

18:35.747 --> 18:41.049
- Yeah. You know, I miss you, Jamie.
- I know. I miss you, too.

18:42.688 --> 18:46.488
Okay, well, I better get going
before I start looking pervy.

18:46.558 --> 18:49.755
- What's "pervy"?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

18:49.828 --> 18:51.921
Go ahead and play, I'll see you again.

18:51.997 --> 18:53.988
- Okay. Bye, Grandpa.
- Bye, buddy.

18:54.066 --> 18:58.332
Hey. Remember. Our secret.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.600
Hey, kid. You see that little boy?

19:05.911 --> 19:08.812
You mess with him, you answer to me,
you hear me?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.712
All right, pass that around.

19:14.052 --> 19:16.885
<i>PS YCHIA TRIST: Let's talk a little more</i>
<i>about basketball, Nathan.</i>

19:17.923 --> 19:21.882
I find it interesting
that when you describe yourselves,

19:21.960 --> 19:26.659
you describe being parents
and spouses and siblings and friends.

19:27.166 --> 19:31.296
But, Nathan, you never once described
yourself as a basketball player.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.530
It's because I'm not anymore.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.764
Why not?

19:33.839 --> 19:36.364
Well, it sort of happens
when your spine gets crushed.

19:36.441 --> 19:39.103
And the doctors definitively said
you couldn't play?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.805
There's no such thing as definitively,

19:40.879 --> 19:46.078
but nobody's ever come back
from something like this before.

19:46.151 --> 19:47.948
But you're Nathan Scott.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.681
I'm not that Nathan Scott.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.451
And, Haley, you never refer
to yourself as a musician.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.925
Yeah. Yeah, well, I haven't recorded
in a really long time.

19:55.994 --> 19:57.222
Why not?

19:58.664 --> 20:02.430
I had a son to raise, and Nathan's accident.

20:02.501 --> 20:03.832
And now?

20:03.902 --> 20:06.564
Now I still have a son to raise,

20:06.638 --> 20:09.766
because I haven't found
a really unattractive nanny yet.

20:11.143 --> 20:14.203
Look, I'm only as intelligent
as the diplomas on my wall,

20:14.279 --> 20:16.179
but here's a thought.

20:16.481 --> 20:18.449
Maybe you aren't the people
you fell in love with

20:18.517 --> 20:22.453
because neither of you is trying
to be the people you fell in love with.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.317
(PHONE VIBRATING)

20:31.630 --> 20:34.292
Do you think you're ready
to be a mother, Brooke?

20:34.366 --> 20:36.732
- Yes, I do.
- Why?

20:38.203 --> 20:44.164
Because sometimes all a child needs
to succeed is love.

20:44.876 --> 20:48.107
Love from a parent
who can provide a stable

20:48.180 --> 20:50.580
and caring environment, and I can do that.

20:50.649 --> 20:53.482
And was your home life safe and caring?

20:57.623 --> 20:58.749
No.

20:59.658 --> 21:02.593
- Do you think you'll ever get married?
- I don't know.

21:02.661 --> 21:04.686
If I met the right person,
I suppose I would.

21:04.763 --> 21:07.630
But you haven't met the right person yet?

21:07.699 --> 21:09.860
- Owen, the bartender...
- Bar manager.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.598
Chase Adams or Lucas Scott?

21:17.142 --> 21:19.372
Why did you close the store?

21:21.246 --> 21:23.942
- How long you been home?
- A few months.

21:24.016 --> 21:27.782
- And have you heard any new music?
- Yeah, a lot.

21:28.553 --> 21:34.185
- Didn't get it at my store, did you?
- Oh, okay, I see. It's my fault.

21:34.259 --> 21:36.227
No, it's no one's fault.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.230
I buy all my music online, too, you know,
it's just the way it is.

21:39.298 --> 21:43.598
Yeah. But the store really was
a lot more than that.

21:43.669 --> 21:44.966
I hope so.

21:45.037 --> 21:48.803
I'd like to think it had something to do
with this cool new record label.

21:48.874 --> 21:52.503
This place is really awesome.
It's like the Batcave in here.

21:52.577 --> 21:55.569
Tell me you fight crime at night,
like, secretly, in a leather catsuit.

21:55.647 --> 22:00.380
Oh, my God. Max, you are the guy
that lives at home, huh?

22:04.823 --> 22:07.155
You think about him much?

22:08.160 --> 22:09.354
Lucas?

22:11.730 --> 22:13.163
Every day.

22:22.908 --> 22:27.311
I don't understand what Lucas Scott
has to do with my decision to adopt.

22:27.379 --> 22:30.610
You said Peyton was a mess
because the boy she loves

22:30.682 --> 22:33.412
recently almost married someone else.

22:33.485 --> 22:35.919
You also had a relationship with him.

22:35.987 --> 22:38.285
Oh, we dated in high school. So what?

22:38.357 --> 22:40.951
So Lucas Scott falls in love
with someone else,

22:41.026 --> 22:44.587
Peyton hits the bar
and you decide to find love elsewhere.

22:44.663 --> 22:47.223
By adopting?

22:47.299 --> 22:49.392
Look, I want to say this
as politely as possible,

22:49.468 --> 22:53.928
but that logic is awfully cynical,
not to mention completely wrong.

22:54.005 --> 22:56.166
It's just the timing seems
a little questionable.

22:56.241 --> 22:57.936
Well, I've been thinking
about having a child

22:58.009 --> 23:01.945
since before I moved back to Tree Hill.
And I know that I'm young,

23:02.013 --> 23:04.345
but I explained to you,
I have an accelerated life,

23:04.416 --> 23:08.375
and on average, most women have
their first child at the age of 25.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.943
I looked it up.

23:10.922 --> 23:14.289
Okay. Let's move on.

23:14.659 --> 23:17.059
- Any drug use?
- I don't use drugs.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.892
But in high school,
didn't you run a campaign

23:18.964 --> 23:20.932
based on partying and promiscuity?

23:20.999 --> 23:24.457
I think this was around the time
you were arrested for shoplifting.

23:24.536 --> 23:26.060
I am not who I was in high school.

23:26.138 --> 23:29.767
And you recently housed a drug addict
named Rachel Gatina.

23:32.077 --> 23:35.012
I would never let my child do drugs.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.281
And I can't say that I know
where you're getting all this information,

23:39.351 --> 23:42.980
but I don't know how it affects
my ability to be a good...

23:46.057 --> 23:47.957
You spoke to my mother.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.259
Have you spoken with Peyton?

23:52.564 --> 23:54.896
- Not since the wedding?
- No.

23:55.400 --> 24:01.305
Jamie went missing, then I had to deal
with Dan and then we left.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.705
And the book. This whole Comet business

24:04.776 --> 24:06.971
that Lindsey was going on
about at the altar...

24:07.045 --> 24:08.910
So Peyton drives a fricking Comet,
what the hell?

24:08.980 --> 24:12.472
I mean, thank God the guy
in the book didn't see a white Bronco,

24:12.551 --> 24:16.180
they'd all say I'm in love with O.J. Man!

24:16.988 --> 24:20.617
- What kind of car does Lindsey drive?
- Oh, that's not fair.

24:20.692 --> 24:25.425
It is not fair that you spoke
with my mother.

24:25.497 --> 24:27.692
We always speak with applicants' families.

24:27.766 --> 24:29.700
I understand that, but did mine tell you

24:29.768 --> 24:31.235
that she was just let go
from my company?

24:31.303 --> 24:34.295
- Yes, she did.
- Sour grapes, don't you think?

24:34.372 --> 24:37.307
I think it's gotta be pretty busy for you
in the absence of your CEO.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.434
I'm really not that busy.

24:39.511 --> 24:40.773
(PHONE VIBRATING)

24:40.846 --> 24:46.045
That's 17, by the way.
That's 17 phone calls this afternoon.

24:46.117 --> 24:48.585
A lot of them are emails.

24:48.653 --> 24:52.089
Brooke, we ask our adoptive families
to take at least six months off

24:52.157 --> 24:54.785
to smooth the transition
for the new children.

24:54.860 --> 24:57.693
It's much easier
in a two-parent household.

24:58.563 --> 25:01.225
Were you from a two-parent household?

25:02.067 --> 25:04.865
My parents were divorced when I was 12.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.597
I'm sorry to hear that.

25:07.672 --> 25:12.166
But some of the best people that I know
are from single-parent households.

25:12.844 --> 25:14.539
Are you from a two-parent household?

25:14.613 --> 25:16.638
Something tells me you already know
the answer to that.

25:16.715 --> 25:18.979
I'd like to hear it from you.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.483
I'm from a no-parent household.

25:25.557 --> 25:28.788
My father cared a lot more about
his golf score than he ever did about me,

25:28.860 --> 25:31.886
and my mom went heavy
on the Scotch and Prada.

25:33.965 --> 25:35.159
The good news is that thanks to them,

25:35.233 --> 25:39.033
I know exactly what kind of parent
I won't be.

25:39.604 --> 25:41.162
I won't be an absentee parent.

25:41.239 --> 25:44.174
If I have to sacrifice some things,
then so be it.

25:44.242 --> 25:48.474
That's noble, Haley.
But it also might be part of the problem.

25:48.547 --> 25:53.007
You both have individual passions,
individual gifts, individual dreams,

25:53.084 --> 25:56.349
and you should, especially at your age.

25:56.421 --> 26:01.358
Maybe if you spent a little more time
being selfish 22-year-olds,

26:01.426 --> 26:05.385
you might love yourself a bit more
and resent each other a bit less.

26:05.463 --> 26:08.364
I don't resent Haley or Jamie.

26:08.433 --> 26:10.560
And they're the two best things
that ever happened to me.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.227
Yeah, I agree with that.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.398
We're the best things
that ever happened to him.

26:17.709 --> 26:21.110
No. I agree that Nathan
and Jamie are the best

26:21.179 --> 26:23.477
and most important things that I have.

26:23.548 --> 26:26.949
What about music?
I asked Nathan this before.

26:27.686 --> 26:32.783
What was it like hearing the cheers of
enthusiastic, sold-out crowds every night?

26:33.858 --> 26:37.851
Incredible. It was humbling and wonderful.

26:38.530 --> 26:40.430
But it took you away from Nathan?

26:40.498 --> 26:43.262
Yeah, and we really struggled then.

26:43.835 --> 26:45.427
I mean, I'm not avoiding music now

26:45.503 --> 26:47.528
because I'm afraid
that's gonna happen again, but...

26:47.606 --> 26:48.868
Good.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.876
Leaving Jamie out of all this,
would you say those were your best days?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.969
Were you happiest with yourself?

26:55.046 --> 26:58.914
Well, I wasn't proud of myself,
because I knew Nathan was hurting.

27:00.118 --> 27:03.110
But personally, I guess I loved it, yeah.

27:05.357 --> 27:09.919
What about you, Nathan? Best days ever?
Playing basketball in front of thousands?

27:09.995 --> 27:12.623
And the road trips sucked
because I was away from Haley and Jamie,

27:12.697 --> 27:16.463
but, for me, yeah.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.061
If you could have those days back, do you
think you might do things differently?

27:22.140 --> 27:26.440
Maybe treat each other a bit differently
in the face of those dreams?

27:26.778 --> 27:28.541
- Yeah.
- Definitely.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.914
Maybe you can. Maybe you will.

27:34.986 --> 27:40.014
<i>MAN: (SINGING)</i>
<i>What kind of man did you dream of?</i>

27:40.091 --> 27:44.653
<i>Was he making mistakes like I was?</i>

27:44.729 --> 27:46.856
I wish I could change some of the things

27:46.931 --> 27:50.025
about how I've acted
in the last couple months.

27:50.835 --> 27:53.565
I guess I'm just disappointed in myself.

27:53.638 --> 27:57.005
You know, I told Lucas
that if he loved his fiancée,

27:57.075 --> 28:02.172
then I would learn to be okay with that,
because I wanted him to be happy,

28:03.181 --> 28:07.242
but really I just wanted us to be happy,
me and him.

28:08.353 --> 28:10.287
Oh, and then when he didn't marry her,

28:10.355 --> 28:15.554
I mean, I felt terrible for her,
and for him, you know.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.653
His heart is breaking right now,

28:18.730 --> 28:24.498
and I come in here and I sit in silence

28:24.569 --> 28:28.335
and hear the echoes of who we used to be.

28:30.942 --> 28:37.643
And so I wish for patience and grace,

28:39.050 --> 28:41.746
and the strength to just let him be happy.

28:42.387 --> 28:48.986
And mostly I pray for the strength to not
make his life worse 'cause of what I want.

28:51.396 --> 28:54.524
That's the toughest part.
Letting go, you know?

28:57.902 --> 29:00.837
That's the part of grace that really sucks.

29:07.145 --> 29:10.376
Today for Show and Tell,
I brought my bunny, Chester.

29:10.448 --> 29:13.042
Chester's my best friend ever.

29:13.685 --> 29:16.153
My nanny, Carrie, used to be
my best friend,

29:16.221 --> 29:20.123
but she tried to put stuff in my hair
and take me away.

29:20.191 --> 29:24.127
Now I guess it's a tie
between my Uncle Skills,

29:24.195 --> 29:26.663
my Aunt Brooke, and Chester.

29:26.731 --> 29:30.223
Oh, and my Grandpa Dan.
He brought me home.

29:31.002 --> 29:33.300
DAN: You know how I got this scar, Sam?

29:34.539 --> 29:38.566
I was helping my son, Nathan.
You see, family is important to me.

29:39.978 --> 29:43.379
And didn't you go to prison
for killing your brother?

29:45.483 --> 29:47.144
I've changed.

29:47.218 --> 29:49.015
Come on, people don't change.

29:49.087 --> 29:51.317
Take it from me, most of the people
who walk through that door

29:51.389 --> 29:54.256
walk right back into prison
within a year's time.

29:55.827 --> 29:57.988
That's not gonna happen to me.

29:58.062 --> 30:01.930
Well, we'll see about that. Scott.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.031
I can't keep this.

30:07.071 --> 30:11.064
My debt to society is square.
Donate it to charity.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.269
Evil for good, right?

30:16.981 --> 30:18.642
Nice talk, Sammy.

30:26.891 --> 30:29.325
This wasn't a good talk, was it?

30:31.029 --> 30:34.897
I mean, I didn't pass, did I?
You're not gonna recommend me?

30:35.767 --> 30:39.703
No, I am not going to recommend you
for adoption, Brooke.

30:39.771 --> 30:44.333
I'm sorry, but the truth is
you are very young

30:44.409 --> 30:47.503
and you're single,
and I can't remember another case

30:47.579 --> 30:51.743
where an applicant's mother said,
"She'd make a terrible candidate."

30:54.319 --> 30:58.585
Well, it's too bad nobody interviewed
her before she had a kid, right?

30:59.357 --> 31:01.552
I'm sorry we can't help you.

31:04.195 --> 31:07.961
You're not sorry, but you should be.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.460
Do you know what my mother said to me

31:10.535 --> 31:13.698
when I told her
I wanted to start a company?

31:13.771 --> 31:16.205
She said,
"Your chances are one in a million,"

31:16.274 --> 31:20.938
and I said, "Maybe I'm that one."
And she said, "You're not."

31:22.680 --> 31:24.841
And she was wrong.

31:24.916 --> 31:29.410
And whatever she thought
she saw in me was wrong.

31:29.487 --> 31:33.218
Because I am one in a million,

31:33.892 --> 31:39.296
and there is a child out there who has
something so special inside of them,

31:39.664 --> 31:43.964
but whose life is miserable because
they think that nobody wants them.

31:44.636 --> 31:48.538
And I could be a great mother
to that child,

31:48.606 --> 31:52.007
no matter their age or race or sex.

31:53.378 --> 31:56.472
I could help them find
what makes them special.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.809
And if you can't see that,
then you're wrong.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.750
Just like my mother.

32:04.756 --> 32:07.816
Now why don't you go ahead
and write that down?

32:09.027 --> 32:13.691
<i>MAN: (SINGING)</i>
<i>It's better to jump overboard</i>

32:15.500 --> 32:19.834
<i>Before this ship starts sinking</i>

32:25.076 --> 32:26.907
Where's Mama?

32:26.978 --> 32:30.106
Hey, sleepy head, she'll be back soon.

32:30.181 --> 32:31.671
How did you sleep?

32:31.749 --> 32:34.547
- I had a dream about Daddy.
- Oh, yeah?

32:34.619 --> 32:36.951
Mmm-hmm. And you were there.

32:37.021 --> 32:41.253
And you were sad, but Daddy said
everything's gonna be okay.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.730
It's all gonna be okay, I know that.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.772
It's just some days are kind of messy,
you know?

32:54.839 --> 32:57.171
Well, it's only life.

32:57.241 --> 32:59.869
At least according to Mia Catalano.

33:01.112 --> 33:03.672
You ever wonder where she'd be
if you didn't decide to start this label?

33:03.748 --> 33:06.148
- She would be fine.
- Maybe not.

33:06.217 --> 33:08.481
You changed her life, Peyton.

33:08.953 --> 33:11.012
So maybe that's why you came home.

33:11.089 --> 33:14.923
To change the life of the next artist,
or the one after that.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.696
Maybe change your own life
at the same time.

33:19.197 --> 33:23.531
I think you're good here.
You just need a little patience.

33:24.135 --> 33:26.035
Patience.

33:26.104 --> 33:30.336
- Time heals old wounds, huh?
- Time, music.

33:32.243 --> 33:33.608
Let me ask you something.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.238
When's the last time you got
in that cool car of yours,

33:36.314 --> 33:38.782
turned up the stereo and just drove?

33:41.786 --> 33:43.981
You might try that sometime.

33:44.789 --> 33:48.190
Maybe find something there to heal
that broken heart of yours.

33:50.762 --> 33:54.254
- Then again, I am 36...
- Thirty-six and still living at home, yeah.

33:54.332 --> 33:57.130
So what the hell do I know, right?

33:59.771 --> 34:01.102
Thanks.

34:02.940 --> 34:06.171
Now, we're nearly out of time, so let's end
this session as we have every week.

34:06.244 --> 34:08.712
Haley, tell me some things
you love about Nathan.

34:08.780 --> 34:13.478
I love that he's here with me every week,
without fail.

34:14.385 --> 34:18.411
And I love that he holds himself
accountable for his mistakes,

34:18.489 --> 34:23.324
and I love that he's so protective
over me and Jamie.

34:24.594 --> 34:27.291
And I love that shirt that he's wearing.

34:27.665 --> 34:30.099
And maybe the way he wears it.

34:30.868 --> 34:32.165
Nathan.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.567
(TIMER BEEPING)

34:34.371 --> 34:37.000
It's okay, really.
I'm not that great at taking a compliment.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.511
Oh, well, we'll be working
on that next week, then.

34:41.079 --> 34:44.571
You two are going to be okay.
I really think so.

34:48.152 --> 34:49.346
Thanks.

34:51.722 --> 34:54.121
LINDSEY:
Can you pick up line 1 for me, please?

34:59.697 --> 35:00.857
Hi.

35:07.605 --> 35:11.097
I've been traveling with my mom since...

35:11.175 --> 35:15.703
Yeah, I talked to Haley.
I'm glad Jamie's okay.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.273
Yeah.

35:23.154 --> 35:27.955
Look, I know I owe you this,
but I'm not going to publish it.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.985
- Luke.
- Look, I know you promised your boss

35:32.063 --> 35:34.531
a second book out of me, but I can't.

35:34.599 --> 35:37.727
You have to. They'll void your deal,
they'll make you pay back your advance,

35:37.802 --> 35:41.033
and on top of that,
it's too good not to publish.

35:41.105 --> 35:42.470
I miss you.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.867
I do. Lindsey, I love you.

35:46.444 --> 35:50.403
Every day I wake up
and I have this ache in my chest.

35:51.516 --> 35:55.213
And sometimes I just sleep in
because I know when I wake up,

35:55.286 --> 35:57.345
you're not gonna be there.

35:58.990 --> 36:01.686
I love you, too, Luke, you know that.

36:02.960 --> 36:05.428
But I can't be with you.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.932
It's okay.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.461
I'll publish the book if you edit it.

36:14.539 --> 36:17.508
- Luke.
- That's it, that's my offer.

36:19.610 --> 36:23.979
There'll be long nights, heated arguments.
It'll be like we're married.

36:28.853 --> 36:33.984
I'll edit the book because I believe in it.
And I believe in you.

36:35.226 --> 36:38.684
- But we can't be together.
- We will be.

36:40.031 --> 36:43.023
One of these days you're gonna wake up
and you'll feel that same need

36:43.100 --> 36:46.501
in your heart and you're gonna
realize how much I love you.

36:46.571 --> 36:51.167
And whenever that day is,
I'll still be waiting for you.

36:52.743 --> 36:54.938
And you'll come home to me.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.842
(DOOR CLOSING)

37:15.499 --> 37:18.161
<i>MAN: (SINGING) Wish I were with you</i>

37:18.903 --> 37:21.269
<i>But I couldn't stay</i>

37:25.676 --> 37:26.768
Hi.

37:27.445 --> 37:30.437
<i>Every direction</i>

37:30.881 --> 37:33.475
<i>Leads me away</i>

37:33.551 --> 37:34.916
Hi, buddy.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.324
<i>Pray for tomorrow</i>

37:42.893 --> 37:45.623
<i>But for today</i>

37:51.469 --> 37:55.428
<i>All I want is to be home</i>

37:55.506 --> 37:57.804
It's quiet around here without Jamie.

37:57.875 --> 38:02.244
- Yeah. He's with Brooke. Baby steps.
- Yeah.

38:03.814 --> 38:06.146
How are you sleeping these days?

38:06.484 --> 38:10.443
So-so. Jamie tosses around
like a Tasmanian devil.

38:10.521 --> 38:12.284
He should probably get back
to his own bed soon.

38:12.356 --> 38:14.381
The separation thing.

38:15.459 --> 38:18.360
Or he could sleep in the spare bedroom
with me.

38:22.967 --> 38:26.562
You know, sometimes I find
your goodness staggering.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.134
I didn't get a chance
to tell you in the session,

38:31.208 --> 38:35.304
but your kindness is overwhelming, Haley.

38:36.080 --> 38:38.139
You saved my life.

38:41.185 --> 38:45.246
I haven't said it lately,
you're also sexy as hell.

38:51.896 --> 38:56.162
Hey, I was thinking,

38:57.702 --> 39:00.068
not sleeping in this bed

39:02.206 --> 39:06.404
might not be so bad tonight,
if you wanted to try it with me.

39:16.287 --> 39:17.845
You got any more of that sexy talk?

39:17.922 --> 39:21.221
What, the kindness stuff,
or the sexy stuff?

39:21.292 --> 39:22.452
Sexy.

39:22.526 --> 39:24.551
You have a serious ass, Haley James.

39:25.796 --> 39:32.292
<i>No fear of my heart, absence of faith</i>
