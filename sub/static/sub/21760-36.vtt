Giddyap, Captain.

01:24.540 --> 01:26.790
Come and get it, Captain!

01:26.790 --> 01:27.920
Come on!

01:30.170 --> 01:33.460
Man, that's got "thrill ride"
written all over it.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.250
You guys should check this out.

01:46.210 --> 01:49.040
All right, let's go, Captain!

01:49.040 --> 01:51.670
Whoaaa! I don't think so, Lucky.

01:51.670 --> 01:54.750
This is too dangerous
for rambunctious puppies.

01:54.750 --> 01:56.580
Spot: Hey, slow down!

01:56.580 --> 01:59.710
You have four legs,
I only got two!

02:01.460 --> 02:04.540
Lucky: Whoaaaaa!
Look out below!

02:04.540 --> 02:06.170
Aaaah!

02:06.170 --> 02:07.540
Uh-oh.

02:09.080 --> 02:11.460
Phew! That was close.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.420
Tell me nobody saw that.

02:14.420 --> 02:16.790
Oh, you were right, Captain.

02:16.790 --> 02:18.920
This is dangerous.

02:21.830 --> 02:24.080
Cruella: Letitia, darling!

02:24.080 --> 02:26.960
You are such a dear
to appraise my new painting.

02:26.960 --> 02:28.710
I'm sure it's worth a fortune.

02:28.710 --> 02:31.880
It is, after all,
a portrait of me!

02:31.880 --> 02:33.880
Yes, Cruella, dear.

02:33.880 --> 02:36.000
And who amongst us
wouldn't want to see you

02:36.000 --> 02:38.040
hanging in their parlor?

02:38.040 --> 02:41.080
Just a quick stop
to pick up some
designs from Anita

02:41.080 --> 02:42.420
and we're off.

02:42.420 --> 02:44.750
I let her do all
my menial etchings.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.710
Poor dear, it makes
her feel needed.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.040
Uggh!

02:51.460 --> 02:55.710
"Play tag with us, Spot.
It'll be fun, Spot."

02:55.710 --> 02:57.120
Easy for you to say!

02:57.120 --> 03:00.250
You're not wearing
base-coated primer!

03:01.880 --> 03:03.920
Here comes
the second coat of shame.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.920
I'll only be a second,
Letitia, dear.

03:09.830 --> 03:12.120
It... it...

03:12.120 --> 03:16.500
it...
it's a masterpiece!

03:16.500 --> 03:18.290
Come, come, Letitia,
we're off.

03:18.290 --> 03:20.710
This is pure genius!

03:20.710 --> 03:22.380
Look at the feathery
brush strokes.

03:22.380 --> 03:24.080
Color plucked
from a vibrant

03:24.080 --> 03:25.960
neo-Impressionist
palette.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.920
Sheer poetry
in motion!

03:28.920 --> 03:31.210
Letitia,
get a grip.

03:31.210 --> 03:33.500
It's poultry
in semigloss.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.040
Au contraire!

03:35.040 --> 03:37.830
This chicken is
a pullet Picasso.

03:37.830 --> 03:41.000
A work like this
could be worth
millions!

03:43.420 --> 03:45.750
Of course, the chicken
is a genius.

03:49.250 --> 03:52.040
But it's not like you really
painted it.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.210
You were just trying
to wipe paint off.

03:54.210 --> 03:57.500
B-b-but they both said
I was a genius.

03:57.500 --> 03:59.790
What if I am
the pullet's Picasso

03:59.790 --> 04:01.710
and just didn't know it?

04:01.710 --> 04:03.710
Could it be true?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.540
all, laughing: No!

04:06.830 --> 04:08.920
Fine. They laughed
at Van Gogh, too.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.960
I'd cut off my ear...

04:10.960 --> 04:13.620
if I had one.

04:13.620 --> 04:15.620
Jasper: Come here, you!

04:15.620 --> 04:17.540
Horace: Tell me again
why Cruella wanted

04:17.540 --> 04:20.500
an uncooked bucket
of chicken?

04:22.670 --> 04:27.500
Letitia, it's time
to talk turkey.

04:35.750 --> 04:36.920
Uh-huh!

04:36.920 --> 04:39.580
Cruella: Scorch!
That chicken isn't your meal.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.880
She's our meal ticket!

04:43.420 --> 04:45.500
All right,
rotisserie Renoir.

04:45.500 --> 04:47.960
Let's see
some magic, hmm?

04:49.620 --> 04:52.830
Oh, that's wonderful,
wonderful!

04:52.830 --> 04:57.500
Chicken, I am
going to make you
a household word.

04:57.500 --> 05:00.920
Hee hee! Maybe there is
something to this
genius thing.

05:00.920 --> 05:03.750
Whoa! Hah! Yeah!

05:05.330 --> 05:08.750
Oh, the colors, the lines!

05:08.750 --> 05:10.670
The cash!

05:10.670 --> 05:13.830
Help! Help! Spot's gone!

05:13.830 --> 05:15.500
She's been chicknapped!

05:15.500 --> 05:17.210
all: Cruella!

05:23.420 --> 05:26.380
It's a good thing
I recognized
this chicken's talent.

05:26.380 --> 05:29.880
I have such a keen eye
for brush-stroking
broasters.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.880
The opening is set
for Saturday night.

05:32.880 --> 05:35.080
I've promised 100 originals.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.830
I trust you can deliver
100 paintings by then?

05:38.830 --> 05:41.750
Yes, yes, don't crack
your make-up, Letitia.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.960
My talented little
drumstick Degas

05:43.960 --> 05:46.750
will paint her feathers
off if she has to.

05:50.380 --> 05:52.920
You guys could help me,
you know.

05:52.920 --> 05:56.620
I thought this
was some sort of
Iron John macho thing.

05:56.620 --> 05:58.290
All you
had to do was ask.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.500
Hyah! Yah! Ugh...

06:04.790 --> 06:07.170
Cadpig: Spot! Spot!

06:07.170 --> 06:09.620
Hey, what are you guys
doing here?

06:09.620 --> 06:12.330
Come on, we're
breaking you out.

06:12.330 --> 06:14.540
Hey, what's the big idea?

06:14.540 --> 06:17.170
Stop, stop, stop!

06:17.170 --> 06:18.380
We're trying

06:18.380 --> 06:20.080
to help you, Spot!

06:20.080 --> 06:21.710
Maybe I don't need help.

06:21.710 --> 06:25.790
You know, I've got an art
opening on Saturday night.

06:25.790 --> 06:28.670
But Cruella's just using you
to make money.

06:28.670 --> 06:32.830
Ha! Cruella is helping me
to discover my true vision.

06:32.830 --> 06:34.790
I am an artiste!

06:34.790 --> 06:36.880
A rising star.

06:36.880 --> 06:39.420
You mean you like living here
with Cruella?

06:39.420 --> 06:41.710
Lucky, dear Lucky.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.290
I know it must be hard
for a mere puppy
to understand

06:44.290 --> 06:46.790
the complex inner life
of an artiste,

06:46.790 --> 06:49.620
but for the first time
in my life I feel

06:49.620 --> 06:52.120
appreciated,
I feel needed.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.790
I feel nauseous.

06:53.790 --> 06:57.000
Come on, guys, let's leave
Chick-o-langelo here

06:57.000 --> 07:00.000
to finish the Sistine Coop.

07:05.620 --> 07:09.080
Only 95 more paintings to go.
Keep it up!

07:09.080 --> 07:10.620
We're on a tight schedule,

07:10.620 --> 07:13.670
but I don't want
to sacrifice quality.

07:21.880 --> 07:24.960
Cruella: Come on,
pullet Pissarro,
no slacking off now.

07:24.960 --> 07:27.540
Mustn't fall behind schedule!

07:30.500 --> 07:33.120
Oh, come on, now,
we can't disappoint our public.

07:33.120 --> 07:35.040
Let's paint, paint, paint!

07:41.710 --> 07:42.670
Oww!

07:49.710 --> 07:53.000
Wakey-wakey,
my wing-ed Warhol.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.960
Wake up, chicken!

07:54.960 --> 07:56.710
Huh?! Oh!

07:56.710 --> 07:59.880
48, 49, 50, 51?

07:59.880 --> 08:04.080
Oh, only 51 completed paintings,
and the opening is tonight!

08:04.080 --> 08:07.210
I need 49 paintings
by 8:00, bird,

08:07.210 --> 08:10.620
or one deep fat fryer,
got it?!

08:13.790 --> 08:15.790
Hmm.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.880
100.

08:27.880 --> 08:32.580
Oh, the creative process
can be so exhausting.

08:38.040 --> 08:39.620
Cruella: Ahem-hem!

08:42.620 --> 08:44.580
Ah, 8:00.

08:47.380 --> 08:50.420
Wake up, chicken.
Your public awaits.

08:53.670 --> 08:55.620
Welcome, welcome!

08:55.620 --> 09:00.040
Cash, checks, credit cards,
and first-born are accepted.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.620
What colors!

09:01.620 --> 09:04.960
The Rhode Island reds
and the cordon blues,

09:04.960 --> 09:08.670
such free-range expression
of a chicken's psyche!

09:08.670 --> 09:11.580
To me, this painting
is really just screaming,

09:11.580 --> 09:13.170
screaming loudly,

09:13.170 --> 09:15.330
"My empty feed dish mocks me."

09:15.330 --> 09:17.540
I mean, you can just
feel the bird's angst

09:17.540 --> 09:19.580
as well as the ennui.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.330
I still don't know
why we're here.

09:26.330 --> 09:27.580
You heard Spot.

09:27.580 --> 09:29.750
She wants to be
with Cruella.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.580
But this is Spot's
big night.

09:31.580 --> 09:33.500
And she is our friend.

09:33.500 --> 09:36.790
Although I think
her use of shadow
is a touch sloppy.

09:36.790 --> 09:38.580
Let's go find her!

09:38.580 --> 09:41.830
And remember, everyone,
these paintings are all for sale

09:41.830 --> 09:44.000
and they're going
fast, fast, fast!

09:44.000 --> 09:47.380
And here she is,
the artiste herself.

09:49.710 --> 09:51.920
Attention, attention, everyone.

09:51.920 --> 09:53.540
I've just come from Grutely,

09:53.540 --> 09:55.580
where I've seen
a sculpting beaver that...

09:55.580 --> 09:58.250
well, he's the rodent Rodin!

10:00.170 --> 10:02.880
Cruella: But what about
the paintings?

10:02.880 --> 10:05.620
What about the pullet Picasso?

10:05.620 --> 10:09.000
What about... my money?

10:09.000 --> 10:12.710
I'm afraid
the chicken
is stale, passé.

10:12.710 --> 10:14.540
Face it,
Cruella darling,

10:14.540 --> 10:16.620
she's yesterday's
white meat.

10:16.620 --> 10:19.880
Jasper, Horace,
get me that beaver!

10:19.880 --> 10:20.920
both: Yes, ma'am.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.710
All right, Scorchy-poo.

10:23.710 --> 10:26.960
That feathered has-been
is all yours.

10:29.580 --> 10:31.380
Yowwwww!

10:31.380 --> 10:34.290
I think our artiste
is gonna need some help.

10:34.290 --> 10:35.580
Over there!

10:44.120 --> 10:46.000
Nice shot,
Rolly.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.290
No prob.

10:47.290 --> 10:48.420
You know, all my life,

10:48.420 --> 10:51.380
cheese has always been there
when I needed it.

10:51.380 --> 10:53.250
Let's get outta here.

10:57.170 --> 10:59.580
So, how does it feel
to be a mere chicken,

10:59.580 --> 11:03.290
back with all the bourgeois
and masses?

11:03.290 --> 11:07.080
Okay, so I'm not an artiste.
I'm a chicken.

11:07.080 --> 11:08.710
Sorry for the way I acted.

11:08.710 --> 11:12.500
It just felt so good to be
appreciated for once, you know?

11:12.500 --> 11:14.790
Hey, we appreciate ya!

11:14.790 --> 11:16.920
Think you have talent, too.

11:16.920 --> 11:18.460
You do?

11:18.460 --> 11:21.750
Yep, and I know just how
you can prove it.

11:26.750 --> 11:30.830
Oh, yeah, I still got it!

11:44.210 --> 11:45.460
Ahem!

11:45.460 --> 11:48.580
Now, I want these bones buried
good!

11:48.580 --> 11:50.710
I wanna see dirt flyin'!

11:50.710 --> 11:52.500
Dig, dig, dig!

11:55.830 --> 11:57.710
Ahh, new tires.

11:57.710 --> 11:59.250
Steel-belted.

11:59.250 --> 12:02.880
P205/60 SR 15s!

12:02.880 --> 12:05.120
What a bouquet!

12:05.120 --> 12:07.960
Lucky: Wow, you can smell
all that?

12:07.960 --> 12:09.380
Pug: Cadet Pudgy!

12:09.380 --> 12:10.880
Oh, man!

12:10.880 --> 12:12.670
You call that
a hole, boy?

12:12.670 --> 12:14.830
I couldn't bury
a flea in that thing!

12:14.830 --> 12:17.420
I guess I'm not
much of a digger.

12:17.420 --> 12:19.420
Sorry, sir.

12:19.420 --> 12:20.880
I'll say you're sorry.

12:20.880 --> 12:24.080
You're the sorriest cadet
who ever put his pants
on two legs at a time!

12:24.080 --> 12:27.170
Now, give me
a double-time dog run
around the yard!

12:27.170 --> 12:29.580
Move, move, move!

12:29.580 --> 12:33.750
Cat got your ear, boy?
I said move!

12:33.750 --> 12:34.790
Yes, sir!

12:34.790 --> 12:36.500
I can't hear you!

12:36.500 --> 12:38.540
Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Yes--

12:38.540 --> 12:39.540
Oww!

12:43.380 --> 12:45.000
Yaah!

12:46.540 --> 12:51.170
You're a mite
small to make such
a big mess, boy.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.460
That tears it!

12:53.460 --> 12:55.540
You are out
of the Bark Brigade.

12:55.540 --> 12:59.040
Finished! Down the drain
without a paddle!

12:59.040 --> 13:01.040
Aw, Lieutenant,
he didn't mean to--

13:01.040 --> 13:03.210
Fact is,
if I'd been in charge,

13:03.210 --> 13:05.790
I would have canned
your tail long ago!

13:05.790 --> 13:09.290
Ahem!
Well, then, good thing
I'm still in command.

13:09.290 --> 13:13.210
After all, we
in the Bark Brigade
know that every member

13:13.210 --> 13:15.830
has a special,
unique talent.

13:15.830 --> 13:17.080
Right, Lieutenant?

13:17.080 --> 13:18.710
Eh, yes, sir!

13:18.710 --> 13:21.120
If I may
say so, sir...

13:21.120 --> 13:22.290
Eh, right.

13:22.290 --> 13:26.500
Lieutenant Pug, I think
you need to give Cadet Rolly

13:26.500 --> 13:30.080
another chance to discover
his enduring talents.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.710
B-b-but, Colonel--

13:31.710 --> 13:33.330
Now, Lieutenant.

13:33.330 --> 13:35.580
Sir, yes, sir!
A chance, sir!

13:37.790 --> 13:39.500
"Enduring talents,"

13:39.500 --> 13:41.040
my Aunt Cupcake.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.330
I'll show him enduring.

13:43.330 --> 13:47.210
Okay, cadet, I'll see you
at 0700 in the woods

13:47.210 --> 13:48.830
for your endurance test.

13:48.830 --> 13:50.830
This shouldn't take long.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.210
Pug:
This is where we separate

13:56.210 --> 13:59.330
the Weimaraners
from the wienie dogs.

13:59.330 --> 14:01.420
Your first test is to,
one, build,

14:01.420 --> 14:04.380
or B, find a shelter.

14:04.380 --> 14:06.420
On your mark,

14:06.420 --> 14:07.670
get set...

14:07.670 --> 14:09.330
Wait, I haven't said it yet.

14:09.330 --> 14:11.250
Go!

14:12.670 --> 14:14.290
Loser!

14:14.290 --> 14:17.710
He'll be out of the Bark Brigade
by, uh, 0900.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.000
Building, building,
building...

14:25.290 --> 14:27.000
Finding...

14:27.000 --> 14:28.210
finding...

14:28.210 --> 14:29.580
finding!
Oooh!

14:29.580 --> 14:32.290
Hey, hey,
I'm working here!

14:32.290 --> 14:33.460
Take a hike!

14:33.460 --> 14:36.920
Stupid dogs, always
messing with my nuts!

14:36.920 --> 14:38.460
Ohh!

14:38.460 --> 14:42.330
Failing, failing, failing...

14:42.330 --> 14:44.290
Can't we do
anything to help him?

14:44.290 --> 14:46.620
Spot: We could suggest
more roughage.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.330
I have a better idea.

14:49.330 --> 14:50.380
Psst! Rolly.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.750
Huh?

14:53.540 --> 14:57.000
Your time is up, Cadet Lardo!

14:57.000 --> 15:00.120
Or should I say
ex-Cadet Lard...Oh!

15:03.120 --> 15:05.960
You tellin' me
you made this?

15:05.960 --> 15:08.170
I, uh...

15:09.750 --> 15:10.920
Uh-huh.

15:12.330 --> 15:16.380
So, cadet, you
passed my cream-puff
warm-up test.

15:16.380 --> 15:18.120
But playtime is over!

15:18.120 --> 15:20.120
It's time to endure!

15:23.290 --> 15:27.420
Thanks, guys,
but let's face it,
I'm no good at this stuff.

15:27.420 --> 15:30.330
Come on, Rolly,
think positively.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.460
Okay.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.120
I'm positive
I'm no good.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.170
Pug: Hurry it up,
cadet!

15:37.330 --> 15:41.080
Pug: Your next test is,
find food.

15:41.080 --> 15:43.580
And I'm not talkin'
nuts and berries here,

15:43.580 --> 15:44.920
I mean real food,

15:44.920 --> 15:47.380
something you can wrap
your jaws around.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.290
Go!

15:53.330 --> 15:55.210
Caramel!

15:58.250 --> 16:00.210
Aww, it's only
an empty wrapper.

16:00.210 --> 16:04.500
Come on, Rolly,
you got the greatest
sniffer in three states.

16:04.500 --> 16:06.170
Yeah, but nothing around here

16:06.170 --> 16:09.080
even slightly smells like food.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.920
Except me.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.250
I'm toast.

16:13.750 --> 16:15.330
Toast?

16:15.330 --> 16:17.460
I smell toast!

16:18.920 --> 16:21.670
French toast!
With a choice
of toppings.

16:21.670 --> 16:23.000
Oh, papa!

16:23.000 --> 16:26.290
Rolly, you just stay here
and seek your inner peace.

16:26.290 --> 16:28.080
We'll be right back.

16:33.250 --> 16:34.290
Yah!

16:36.040 --> 16:39.710
The things I do for friendship.

16:44.210 --> 16:47.710
Whoa, guys!

16:47.710 --> 16:50.750
Wait! Where is
the main course?

16:52.120 --> 16:54.290
Huh?

16:54.290 --> 16:59.830
All right, cadet,
your time is...up?

17:01.420 --> 17:04.960
Funny, their main course
looks familiar.

17:04.960 --> 17:08.500
So, I guess I've been
too easy on you, cadet.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.170
But you'll never endure
this next test.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.170
I guarantee it!

17:14.880 --> 17:19.210
I am a deadly, mangy,
cadet-eating mountain lion.

17:20.120 --> 17:21.580
You are my prey.

17:21.580 --> 17:25.210
Your only chance for survival
is to set a trap for me.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.500
Ready?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.620
Run!

17:28.620 --> 17:32.210
5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
here I come!

17:32.210 --> 17:33.290
Yaaah!

17:37.210 --> 17:38.120
Incoming!

17:38.120 --> 17:40.290
Great, you already set the--

17:40.290 --> 17:42.210
Whoa!

17:42.210 --> 17:43.880
all: Whoa!

17:43.880 --> 17:47.670
Well, well,
the catch of the day.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.290
Look, Lieutenant,
I can explain.

17:49.290 --> 17:51.120
Put a shoe in it!

17:51.120 --> 17:53.620
I should have known
Humpty Rumpty there

17:53.620 --> 17:55.920
couldn't pass a test
without help.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.750
Anyway, the good news is,
once we get home,

17:58.750 --> 18:02.960
I will boot his sorry behind
right out of my beloved corps.

18:02.960 --> 18:05.380
Okay, fall in!

18:05.380 --> 18:07.040
Yowwww!

18:07.040 --> 18:09.080
Isn't that what we're
supposed to do?

18:09.080 --> 18:10.380
all: Whoa!

18:12.000 --> 18:14.540
Whoaaaaaa!

18:19.790 --> 18:21.170
Duck!

18:21.170 --> 18:22.500
Duck

18:22.500 --> 18:25.080
What is it with you guys
and poultry?

18:26.460 --> 18:27.580
Ohhh...

18:27.580 --> 18:30.040
You mean...duck.

18:37.710 --> 18:39.920
Whew!
We're safe.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.120
Interesting word choice.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.500
I would have gone
with "about to die!"

18:45.500 --> 18:47.540
all: Whoa!

18:50.170 --> 18:51.920
So, how do we get outta here?

18:53.290 --> 18:55.540
I smell fresh air.
This way!

18:56.670 --> 18:58.380
I don't smell anything.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.000
Company, halt!

19:00.000 --> 19:04.080
I'm calling the shots here,
so, right face!

19:04.080 --> 19:06.580
Hop to, hop to, hop to,
hop to, hop to!

19:19.460 --> 19:21.670
Hey, where's Lieutenant Pug?

19:21.670 --> 19:24.000
Rolly, sniffing:
I can still smell him.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.540
He's gotta be really close.

19:34.120 --> 19:36.290
Okay, this way.

19:36.290 --> 19:38.830
Eh, or that way!

19:38.830 --> 19:41.790
Oh, I'm getting
thirsty.

19:42.880 --> 19:46.080
Hey, I think I
can smell water.
That way!

19:46.080 --> 19:47.960
What a load
of metal muffins.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.460
But Rolly's nose
is always right.

19:50.460 --> 19:51.920
Is that so?

19:51.920 --> 19:56.540
Well, I am still in command,
and I do not smell water.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.960
Ergo, there is no water!

19:59.960 --> 20:02.670
So quit squawkin'
and keep walkin'!

20:03.830 --> 20:07.790
I said march,
you lily-livered lapdogs!

20:07.790 --> 20:10.040
I wanna see guts,
I wanna see grit,

20:10.040 --> 20:11.500
I wanna see--

20:15.000 --> 20:16.040
...mommy?

20:18.830 --> 20:20.210
We're gonna die!

20:20.210 --> 20:24.210
Trapped, eaten by some
blood-sucking, bone-crunching...

20:28.250 --> 20:31.250
You really should see
somebody about that.

20:33.540 --> 20:36.000
There's
no way out!

20:37.250 --> 20:39.960
Wait! Maybe there is.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.420
What are you doing?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.210
Rolly: Like I told you,
I smell water.

20:43.210 --> 20:45.000
Whoaaaa!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Lots of water!

20:47.000 --> 20:48.670
What happened to the monster?

20:48.670 --> 20:49.790
There it is!

20:51.670 --> 20:55.500
Monster!
Abandon ship!

20:55.500 --> 20:57.290
Please keep
your paws and legs

20:57.290 --> 20:59.830
inside
of this reality.

20:59.830 --> 21:01.580
Spot: Which way is out?!

21:01.580 --> 21:03.500
There's no way to tell.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.960
Wait.
I smell food.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.960
Yes. It's a French fry.

21:07.960 --> 21:09.880
All right!

21:09.880 --> 21:11.120
Rolly: Quick, lean to the left!

21:11.120 --> 21:13.330
Now right!

21:13.330 --> 21:14.670
Left!

21:14.670 --> 21:16.670
-Duck!

21:16.670 --> 21:19.670
French fry, here I come.

21:25.830 --> 21:28.880
Whoaaaa!

21:31.880 --> 21:33.040
Ahhhh!

21:33.040 --> 21:35.830
Hooray for Rolly's
olfactory skills!

21:35.830 --> 21:38.330
Rolly,
you saved us all!

21:38.330 --> 21:39.750
Isn't that right,
sir?

21:39.750 --> 21:44.290
Well, you're still the fattest
cadet I've ever seen...

21:44.290 --> 21:46.830
I'm promoting your nose.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.460
Colonel: I'm glad
to hear that, Lieutenant.

21:49.460 --> 21:51.920
Because you were being
tested, too.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.500
Oh, yes, your task

21:54.500 --> 21:56.830
was to mold Rolly
into a real cadet,

21:56.830 --> 22:00.000
and apparently you passed
with flying colors.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.080
All right, Rolly!

22:02.080 --> 22:03.920
You saved the day!

22:03.920 --> 22:07.080
See, Rolly, we all have
something to contribute.

22:07.080 --> 22:09.710
Even if it smells.
