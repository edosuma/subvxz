00:03.069 --> 00:05.537
CIA profile:
Agent Sydney Bristow.

00:05.538 --> 00:06.438
Okay. I'm in.

00:06.439 --> 00:09.374
Agent Bristow works undercover
with her father, Jack Bristow.

00:09.442 --> 00:11.243
Also a double agent with CIA.

00:11.244 --> 00:12.678
Get down!

00:12.679 --> 00:14.813
I guess we'll have to learn
to trust each other.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.314
Bristow's CIA contact:
Michael Vaughn.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.151
My guardian angel.

00:19.152 --> 00:23.748
Her current assignment:
to infiltrate and destroy SD-6.

00:23.823 --> 00:26.621
A secret organization
dealing in espionage,

00:26.693 --> 00:29.719
extortion, weapons sales,
posing as the CIA.

00:29.796 --> 00:32.662
SD-6 has made over $400 million
in arms sales alone.

00:32.732 --> 00:34.666
SD-6 director: Arvin Sloane.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.397
The sanctity of this agency
requires the sacrifice

00:37.470 --> 00:38.904
of some personal freedoms.

00:38.905 --> 00:41.405
This is not about cutting off
an arm of the monster.

00:41.474 --> 00:43.308
This is about killing
the monster.

00:43.309 --> 00:46.540
Bristow's mother,
formerly Russian intelligence,

00:46.613 --> 00:49.207
recently turned herself in
to the CIA.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.983
Mom?

00:50.984 --> 00:52.384
Intel indicates

00:52.385 --> 00:55.218
she may still be
an enemy of the United States.

00:56.423 --> 00:59.256
The true loyalty
of Agent Bristow's mother

00:59.325 --> 01:01.326
remains unknown.

01:01.327 --> 01:03.326
Previously on "Alias"...

01:03.327 --> 01:06.021
I could pay you to do research.

01:06.056 --> 01:08.055
All I need you to do is find out
if any of these questions ever appeared

01:08.056 --> 01:10.556
on a standardized test in the United States
over the last twenty years.

01:11.556 --> 01:13.555
- Thank you
- You are welcome

01:13.556 --> 01:16.556
Five weeks ago you infiltrated one
of your mother's laboratories in Taipei

01:16.591 --> 01:18.555
where you discovered a Rambaldi device.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.056
We believe the device is the
source of the virus

01:21.556 --> 01:24.556
Unfortunately, you and Agent
Vaughn may have been exposed.

01:24.591 --> 01:27.556
We'd like to draw some blood and
keep you under observation.

01:28.056 --> 01:31.056
Agent Bristow, your tests came back
negative for antibodies, youâ€™re free to go.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.021
Agent Vaughn, your tests at this
point are inconclusive.

01:34.056 --> 01:37.056
You said Sark tested patient's
blood at the first sign of infection.

01:38.056 --> 01:40.521
What was the sign?

01:40.556 --> 01:43.056
Hemorrhaging from the fingernails.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:16.500 --> 02:19.365
This is Dr. Nicholas calling.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.199
Thanks for getting back to me so soon.

02:21.200 --> 02:23.099
Uh, the thing is,

02:23.100 --> 02:24.599
I think I have a problem.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.199
I know you're worried,

02:26.200 --> 02:29.565
but we ran every available diagnostic
test for viral infections.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.500
Everything that could be related to your
exposure to the fluid inside the Rambaldi device.

02:33.535 --> 02:35.699
They all came back negative.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.365
Yes, I know.

02:38.400 --> 02:42.099
Under my fingernails, there's blood.

02:42.134 --> 02:45.799
Okay, here's what we're going to do.

02:45.800 --> 02:50.100
The virus isn't airborne, but as a precaution I'm
going to send an isolation unit to bring you in.

02:50.135 --> 02:51.299
Don't send anyone.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.199
I'll come to you.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.699
But first, there's someone I need to see.

02:54.700 --> 02:55.899
See them later!

02:55.900 --> 03:01.900
Right now, you stay put!

03:32.400 --> 03:35.665
I know what you did for me.

03:35.700 --> 03:38.900
Proving Sydney's father betrayed her
in Madagascar.

03:38.935 --> 03:44.900
I would have been executed for that.

03:45.400 --> 03:48.265
Thank you.

03:48.300 --> 03:53.300
I didn't do it for you.

03:53.335 --> 03:58.300
While that might be true,

03:58.335 --> 04:00.699
I owe you my life.

04:00.700 --> 04:04.250
You owe me my father's life.

04:04.285 --> 04:07.765
In Cap Ferrat, I saw Khasinau

04:07.800 --> 04:12.200
experiment on people who had been exposed
to the liquid from inside the red ball.

04:12.235 --> 04:14.700
I want to know what he learned
from doing that.

04:14.735 --> 04:15.799
If he found a cure?

04:15.800 --> 04:17.699
Yes.

04:17.700 --> 04:21.000
I know the terms are you only
cooperate with Sydney,

04:21.035 --> 04:24.100
but this disease, it works quickly.

04:24.135 --> 04:27.567
I don't have much time.

04:27.602 --> 04:31.000
You're the one who's sick.

04:31.035 --> 04:32.499
Yes.

04:32.500 --> 04:38.100
Tell me how you feel about my daughter.

04:38.135 --> 04:39.799
That's none of your business.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.565
Are you in love with her?

04:42.600 --> 04:44.299
I don't know why that matters to you.

04:44.300 --> 04:50.200
I don't have the advantage of
observing casual behavior.

04:50.235 --> 04:52.499
I'm curious.

04:52.500 --> 04:55.565
Help me,

04:55.600 --> 05:01.600
and I'll tell you what you want to know.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.999
Okay, tell me if this sounds weird.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.799
I mean, can we talk here?

05:06.800 --> 05:12.800
Hang on.

05:12.900 --> 05:13.799
Bug killer.

05:13.800 --> 05:14.899
In case anyone's listening.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.799
Seriously? In a lipstick?

05:16.800 --> 05:17.999
What were you going to say?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.399
I looked up twenty years of standardized
tests to see if any of those

05:20.400 --> 05:23.400
IQ-type questions Vaughn's interested
in were ever used.

05:23.435 --> 05:24.399
And?

05:24.400 --> 05:24.999
They weren't.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.199
At least in none of the tests I looked up.

05:26.200 --> 05:28.499
But there was a year missing and the educational

05:28.500 --> 05:30.499
testing service didn't have a
hard copy or a disk.

05:30.500 --> 05:34.465
I mean, it is like 1982 never existed.

05:34.500 --> 05:37.465
Maybe someone had a reason
to make it disappear.

05:37.500 --> 05:40.000
You've got to try this bouillabaisse
that I'm making.

05:40.035 --> 05:42.465
Here.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.799
What do you think? Too spicy, too salty?

05:44.800 --> 05:45.599
Perfect.

05:45.600 --> 05:47.299
I'll be done in, like, two minutes.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.499
Okay, great.

05:49.500 --> 05:50.599
So it's weird, right?

05:50.600 --> 05:55.500
There was an operation called
Project Christmas.

05:55.535 --> 05:57.499
My father developed it.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.500
It used standardized tests,
asking specific questions to

06:00.535 --> 06:03.500
identify children the agency
could later recruit.

06:03.800 --> 06:04.799
Children?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.399
It was an experiment.

06:06.400 --> 06:10.100
The KGB sent my mother here to steal
details about the program.

06:10.135 --> 06:14.065
About that time, the CIA stopped
the operation.

06:14.100 --> 06:20.100
Vaughn thinks maybe Russian intelligence is
still running it to recruit Americans.

06:22.500 --> 06:23.099
Hello?

06:23.100 --> 06:27.365
We need you at operations.

06:27.400 --> 06:32.300
I'll tell Francie you said good-bye.

06:32.335 --> 06:34.767
Hey, what's up?

06:34.802 --> 06:37.199
It's Vaughn.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.700
He's developed symptoms.

06:39.735 --> 06:40.399
What symptoms?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.199
The doctor said we were fine.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.599
Yes, but his exposure was
far more extensive.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.500
He's developed some kind of a blood
coagulation disorder.

06:47.535 --> 06:49.599
Do we... are you sure that it...

06:49.600 --> 06:53.099
We're sure.

06:53.134 --> 06:56.599
Where is he?

06:56.600 --> 06:58.299
He came to see your mother
about an antidote.

06:58.300 --> 07:04.300
Shortly after leaving the facility,
he collapsed.

07:08.000 --> 07:09.599
Is there an antidote?

07:09.600 --> 07:12.565
Yes. It can be found in Paldiski.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.300
It's a former Soviet training base
for nuclear submarine personnel.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.399
Who operates the base now?

07:18.400 --> 07:20.299
When Estonia gained independence,

07:20.300 --> 07:26.200
the local authorities graciously accepted
our offer to take over the facility.

07:26.235 --> 07:31.200
I can tell you were it is in the
facility, but even if you can get it,

07:31.235 --> 07:34.465
I can't guarantee anything.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.400
This antidote sounds almost as
dangerous as the infection.

07:37.435 --> 07:38.699
If Derevko is telling us the truth...

07:38.700 --> 07:40.399
Which is a valid question.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.199
Then the serum is a blood derivative.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.400
Meaning you just can't get the medicine
and inject it into the sick patient.

07:45.435 --> 07:46.599
How would something like this work?

07:46.600 --> 07:47.999
You need blood from the patient.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.099
In this case, Vaughn.

07:49.100 --> 07:52.665
The equipment that manufactures
the serum reads the blood and

07:52.700 --> 07:54.699
creates a custom genetic-specific
antidote for that particular patient.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.300
I'll need to take some of Vaughn's
blood with me.

07:57.335 --> 07:58.199
Yes.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.499
This is Agent Chapman,

07:59.500 --> 08:03.100
he'll be running the op from here while
your father leads the team into Paldiski.

08:03.135 --> 08:04.799
According to Derevko,

08:04.800 --> 08:10.100
the antidote is located at three separate
decontamination stations within the former
nuclear facility.

08:10.135 --> 08:13.600
We'll launch a zodiac a couple miles up the
coast and drop you in as close as we can.

08:13.635 --> 08:14.699
The plane's ready.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.099
You can spec out the mission in flight.

08:16.100 --> 08:20.100
You've got thirty minutes with Vaughn,
maybe less.

08:20.135 --> 08:22.865
How much time does Vaughn have?

08:22.900 --> 08:26.000
There doesn't seem to be a
consistent pattern,

08:26.035 --> 08:27.799
but the virus could act quickly.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.499
Are we talking weeks, days?

08:29.500 --> 08:30.299
Just tell me.

08:30.300 --> 08:36.299
Given his level of exposure,
three days would be my guess.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.899
I'll buy time for us with Sloane.

08:38.900 --> 08:44.900
Go.

08:46.700 --> 08:52.700
U.S. NAVAL MEDICAL CENTER

09:17.500 --> 09:22.065
Hi.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.399
I talked to my mother,

09:24.400 --> 09:26.299
there's an antidote.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.499
I'm going to go get it.

09:28.500 --> 09:29.999
How dangerous?

09:30.000 --> 09:32.099
Getting the serum?

09:32.100 --> 09:37.265
Nah, it'll be easy.

09:37.300 --> 09:43.300
But I need to take some
of your blood with me, okay?

10:06.400 --> 10:12.400
Couple of days, you'll be doing
wind sprints.

10:19.200 --> 10:25.200
Be careful.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.165
Syd...

10:33.200 --> 10:39.200
sorry I'm so tired.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.099
Vaughn! Vaughn!

10:51.100 --> 10:52.399
He's bleeding internally!

10:52.400 --> 10:54.299
Shall we prepare for a lavage?

10:54.300 --> 10:55.699
Yes, have you called the blood bank?

10:55.700 --> 10:58.600
They've already typed and crossed
for six units of packed RBCs.

10:58.635 --> 10:59.799
Have you reached Dr. Simon?

10:59.800 --> 11:01.799
He's not on call, but Dr. Carlson
is on his way in...

11:01.800 --> 11:02.999
Wait, wait, wait!

11:03.000 --> 11:04.099
Wait a minute, what's going on?

11:04.100 --> 11:04.999
Is he going to be all right?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.700
We don't know, but you have to wait here.

11:07.735 --> 11:08.899
Your designated cover...

11:08.900 --> 11:11.099
you're with the state department
bureau of arms control.

11:11.100 --> 11:15.100
Your name is Rita Stevens, give
no details about his illness.

11:15.135 --> 11:18.265
Excuse me,

11:18.300 --> 11:20.599
did they tell you anything?

11:20.600 --> 11:21.499
No.

11:21.500 --> 11:22.899
The paramedics called.

11:22.900 --> 11:24.099
"What was his last meal?

11:24.100 --> 11:27.465
Is he allergic to any medication?"

11:27.500 --> 11:30.600
I got to the hospital as fast as I could...

11:30.635 --> 11:33.800
So you work with Michael?

11:33.835 --> 11:34.499
Yeah.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.900
We're in the same bureau at state.

11:38.935 --> 11:40.767
I'm Rita.

11:40.802 --> 11:42.599
I'm Alice.

11:42.600 --> 11:44.799
I'm listed as his emergency contact.

11:44.800 --> 11:50.000
I'm Michael's girlfriend.

11:50.035 --> 11:56.000
Excuse me.

12:32.400 --> 12:35.365
I was contacted by an informant in Baku.

12:35.400 --> 12:40.200
He indicated that the triad has set up
a listening post near the Armenian border.

12:40.235 --> 12:42.599
I took the liberty of assigning
the recon op to Sydney.

12:42.600 --> 12:46.100
I'll be on the next plane myself.

12:46.135 --> 12:49.600
I went ahead with the exhumation.

12:49.635 --> 12:54.100
I opened Emily's grave.

12:54.135 --> 12:57.265
It was empty.

12:57.300 --> 12:58.899
Have you checked with the funeral home?

12:58.900 --> 13:01.400
Detailed a forensics unit to the gravesite?

13:01.435 --> 13:03.199
I saw her, Jack.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.799
Maybe. You can't be sure.

13:04.800 --> 13:06.499
Emily's alive.

13:06.500 --> 13:11.000
And she knows what I did.

13:11.035 --> 13:15.965
So I am dead to her.

13:16.000 --> 13:19.300
If the Alliance finds out about this
from another source...

13:19.335 --> 13:22.465
I just got off the phone with Christophe.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.500
I told him that someone was trying
to make it look like

13:25.535 --> 13:28.500
I faked Emily's death in order to
secure my position.

13:28.700 --> 13:29.899
It was the smart play.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.399
I'm not so sure.

13:31.400 --> 13:34.400
Even if they believe me,
the timing might make it seem like

13:34.435 --> 13:37.400
I was looking for an excuse for
my recent performance.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.565
Are there concerns?

13:42.600 --> 13:48.300
Since I was made a partner in the Alliance,
SD-6 has consistently stumbled
in its operations.

13:48.335 --> 13:51.165
We lost the terahertz wave camera.

13:51.200 --> 13:53.700
We failed to retrieve the formula
for zero-point energy.

13:53.735 --> 13:56.765
We didn't acquire
Derevko's operations manual.

13:56.800 --> 14:01.500
The situation regarding
Emily has been a distraction.

14:01.535 --> 14:06.367
Informing them puts these setbacks
in context.

14:06.402 --> 14:11.200
Christophe wants me to meet
with him in Tokyo.

14:11.235 --> 14:14.165
I need a victory, Jack.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.965
I need to bring something
tangible to the organization.

14:19.000 --> 14:25.000
We have an asset in custody downstairs who
is familiar with Derevko's operation.

14:25.700 --> 14:31.700
I suggest we take advantage of that.

14:32.200 --> 14:38.000
As the virus progresses, it causes
something called ascending paralysis.

14:38.035 --> 14:41.965
Your nervous system is being poisoned
from your feet up.

14:42.000 --> 14:47.600
You see, the paralysis is affecting the
nerves that control your ability to breathe.

14:47.635 --> 14:50.365
Soon, you will suffocate.

14:50.400 --> 14:53.700
Interestingly, you still have feeling,
but you're paralyzed.

14:53.735 --> 14:59.700
You can still feel both pleasure...

15:00.300 --> 15:01.899
and pain.

15:01.900 --> 15:07.100
Tell me where is Derevko's base
of operations, hmm?

15:07.135 --> 15:13.100
Please...

15:31.400 --> 15:37.400
I want a location.

15:38.200 --> 15:44.200
Smila. Smila.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.165
Hey. Thanks for meeting me.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.099
So I did the work you asked me to do,

16:06.100 --> 16:09.400
but please don't tell me you're chasing
some alleged CIA conspiracy again.

16:09.435 --> 16:11.599
No. I'm just helping out a friend, that's all.

16:11.600 --> 16:17.500
Well, you can tell your friend the questions
he's interested in weren't on the test in '82.

16:17.535 --> 16:18.299
Are you sure?

16:18.300 --> 16:21.165
Those ridiculously difficult
spatial relationship questions?

16:21.200 --> 16:25.200
The ones about why rainbows occur and why you
have to be standing behind the sun to see them?

16:25.235 --> 16:26.099
Yeah.

16:26.100 --> 16:29.100
Not on there. Sorry.

16:29.135 --> 16:30.599
Huh.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.699
Come on, off the record.

16:32.700 --> 16:38.700
What's this all about?

16:39.100 --> 16:40.199
These are propulsion boots.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.499
You can do five knots with them.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.799
We drop you a hundred yards offshore.

16:43.800 --> 16:49.100
You should be at the pier in
under two minutes.

16:49.135 --> 16:51.399
Heckler & Koch P-11 underwater pistol.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.399
Holds five rounds of tranq darts.

16:53.400 --> 16:57.600
Thing's virtually silent.

16:57.635 --> 17:00.965
Good luck.

17:01.000 --> 17:07.000
Paldiski, Estonia

17:29.700 --> 17:33.950
I'm at stage one, outside the facility.

17:33.985 --> 17:38.200
Copy that, Mountaineer. We're standing by.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.099
I just spotted Sark.

18:02.100 --> 18:08.100
I don't need to remind you to
stay out of sight.

18:16.400 --> 18:21.200
Our intel indicates that to use the serum
generator, you need the security pass code.

18:21.235 --> 18:24.200
The jack in this computer, it's got a
satellite link that will let us

18:24.235 --> 18:27.200
get into the system and provide
us with the code you need.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.700
I've got sat link. You should be
receiving data now.

18:40.735 --> 18:42.699
Roger, Mountaineer.
Stand by for the pass code.

18:42.700 --> 18:45.499
2664729.

18:45.534 --> 18:48.299
26647...

18:48.300 --> 18:49.299
Wait.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.499
What?

18:50.500 --> 18:52.799
The generators are peripheral
to the main system.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.499
I don't understand.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.265
The machine is connected to their
central security systems.

18:56.300 --> 18:59.700
If you try to generate the serum, their
security system will be alerted.

18:59.735 --> 19:01.299
Can we circumvent the system?

19:01.300 --> 19:02.899
Not from here.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.899
Mountaineer, abort the op and head back.

19:04.900 --> 19:05.799
We'll find another way to...

19:05.800 --> 19:06.399
Abort?

19:06.400 --> 19:08.965
We don't have time to find something else!

19:09.000 --> 19:10.899
If you use the machine,
they'll know you're there.

19:10.900 --> 19:12.499
Then I'll run fast.

19:12.500 --> 19:18.500
You've been ordered to abort,
Mountaineer, do you copy?

19:37.100 --> 19:43.100
Sir, someone has accessed the
decontamination room.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.099
Agent Bristow.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.300
Those pipes are rigged to
disperse ammonia flurochloride.

20:34.335 --> 20:37.600
Wonderful for decontaminating
metals and concrete.

20:37.635 --> 20:41.000
Not so good on organic materials,

20:41.035 --> 20:43.700
such as your suit.

20:43.735 --> 20:49.700
Or your skin.

20:55.400 --> 20:58.400
You and I, we're destined to work together.

20:58.435 --> 21:04.400
I truly believe that.

21:10.200 --> 21:14.800
Of course, any future collaboration requires
my turning the sprinkler system off.

21:14.835 --> 21:17.300
Notice your suit is already
being eaten away.

21:17.335 --> 21:20.400
I'd give it another forty seconds.

21:20.435 --> 21:23.065
I could use your help.

21:23.100 --> 21:25.499
I need access to Arvin Sloane.

21:25.500 --> 21:27.399
Why?

21:27.400 --> 21:33.400
Because I intend to kill him.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.365
I can get you to Sloane,

21:38.400 --> 21:43.000
but only if you promise
to let me keep the antidote.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.099
No. Sloane first.

21:45.100 --> 21:51.100
Then you'll get back your
precious antidote.

22:00.800 --> 22:03.800
Sark had me taken to the
decontamination room.

22:03.835 --> 22:05.899
He let me go.

22:05.900 --> 22:08.365
I came back here to Los Angeles.

22:08.400 --> 22:10.699
And Sark never asked you who
the antidote was for?

22:10.700 --> 22:12.599
No. He didn't seem to care.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.465
What exactly did you promise Sark?

22:15.500 --> 22:19.900
That I would render Sloane unconscious,
and deliver him to Sark.

22:19.935 --> 22:21.299
So he could kill him.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.899
Yes.

22:22.900 --> 22:25.700
There are just so many problems with this
that I don't even know where to begin.

22:25.735 --> 22:26.399
How about we start with Vaughn?

22:26.400 --> 22:28.599
Do I need to remind you that the American
intelligence, Agent Bristow...

22:28.600 --> 22:29.799
You said yourself that Vaughn
is in critical condition!

22:29.800 --> 22:32.900
...Are not in the business of
committing murder!

22:32.935 --> 22:35.199
Arvin Sloane killed my fiancÃ©.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.965
I have had plenty of opportunities
to return the favor,

22:38.000 --> 22:41.500
but I have chosen not to because, yes,
I know, it's not what we do.

22:41.535 --> 22:44.300
It's what he does and it's reprehensible!

22:44.335 --> 22:45.499
But we have no choice here!

22:45.500 --> 22:47.965
Vaughn could be dead in two days!

22:48.000 --> 22:48.599
- Well, we'll do our best to prevent that.
- What the hell would you have done?!

22:48.600 --> 22:52.700
- Agent Bristow, you don't collaborate with
the enemy like this!
- There is NO choice here!

22:52.735 --> 22:53.199
Sydney...

22:53.200 --> 22:54.999
I am NOT going to do nothing!

22:55.000 --> 22:59.165
Give us a minute, would you?

22:59.200 --> 23:01.299
Don't try and convince me not
to work with Sark!

23:01.300 --> 23:02.699
That's not what I'm doing.

23:02.700 --> 23:03.999
I'm on your side here.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.599
We can't lose Vaughn.

23:06.634 --> 23:09.199
So what do we do?

23:09.200 --> 23:10.899
We don't go through Kendall.

23:10.900 --> 23:12.899
Push him, and he'll run it
through channels.

23:12.900 --> 23:16.465
This needs to be handled quietly.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.900
Sloane is scheduled to attend an Alliance
meeting in Tokyo.

23:19.935 --> 23:22.099
I'll find out the details of his itinerary.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.600
My S.T.U. is not recognizing
my crypto-ignition key.

23:24.635 --> 23:25.699
I need it fixed.

23:25.700 --> 23:25.899
Fine.

23:25.900 --> 23:29.000
Do you know that polar bears can't be
detected by infrared photography?

23:29.035 --> 23:30.399
Their fur emits no heat.

23:30.400 --> 23:35.465
Nothing. Nada. Zip.

23:35.500 --> 23:40.700
I guess I thought maybe it would be
applicable to something, I...

23:40.735 --> 23:42.299
Crypto-ignition key.

23:42.300 --> 23:43.499
I got to do that from the server room.

23:43.500 --> 23:49.500
Excuse me.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.499
What's that?

23:57.500 --> 24:01.765
Oh, it's one of those standardized
tests kids take.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.700
A friend from the newspaper is
interested in me maybe tutoring his kid.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.699
"Reading comprehension essay.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.699
Based on our invasion of Grenada..."?

24:09.700 --> 24:11.299
Yeah. You know, it was weird.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.999
The only test I could download
was from 1982.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.850
Sort of the height of the Reagan era,
Cold War indoctrination.

24:16.885 --> 24:20.700
Well, back when I was listening to
Duran Duran every single day

24:20.735 --> 24:23.200
my uncle was one of the marines
Reagan sent into Grenada.

24:24.100 --> 24:27.065
The invasion was in 1983.

24:27.100 --> 24:30.500
I mean, why would the Department of
Education give you a fake test?

24:30.535 --> 24:32.399
How can I get a hold of
a copy of the original test?

24:32.400 --> 24:34.599
For the love of God,
Will, have you lost your mind?

24:34.600 --> 24:35.899
I mean, the whole test is a fake.

24:35.900 --> 24:38.299
I got it from the Department of Education.

24:38.300 --> 24:43.500
Abby, Abby, look, I don't know exactly what
this means but it could be important.

24:43.535 --> 24:46.165
I spoke to our man in custody.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.300
All he gave us was a province
in the Ukraine.

24:49.335 --> 24:51.199
Smila.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.000
I sent a team there to search for
Derevko's headquarters.

24:54.035 --> 24:55.499
So far they've found nothing.

24:55.500 --> 24:56.899
When do you leave for Tokyo?

24:56.900 --> 24:58.499
I leave in one hour.

24:58.500 --> 25:00.965
I need you to help me, Jack.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.565
I need you to get Richter to talk,

25:03.600 --> 25:07.600
to tell us exactly where in Smila we could
find Derevko's center of operations.

25:07.635 --> 25:13.300
If I go to Japan without something
tangible, something valuable,

25:13.335 --> 25:16.300
I don't know what the Alliance might do.

25:22.200 --> 25:24.649
It doesn't have to end this way.

25:24.684 --> 25:27.099
You could be made very comfortable.

25:27.100 --> 25:29.499
All you have to do is give us an address.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.099
Smila...

25:31.100 --> 25:33.399
Yes, in the Ukraine.

25:33.400 --> 25:34.999
Where in Smila?

25:35.000 --> 25:40.965
All we need is an address.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.950
Just tell me where the hell
Derevko's operation is!

25:43.985 --> 25:46.900
You give me an address now,
you son of a bitch!

25:46.935 --> 25:52.900
Where in Smila do we look?!

25:54.800 --> 26:00.800
Smila... Smila is my wife.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.899
And I love her.

26:09.900 --> 26:13.800
I love her so much.

26:13.835 --> 26:19.800
Just kill him.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.965
You said 1982, right?

26:26.000 --> 26:29.700
There's a serial number. FYB55L.

26:29.735 --> 26:31.699
Popular test.

26:31.700 --> 26:33.299
Popular?

26:33.300 --> 26:35.599
I got a call once from someone at ETS.

26:35.600 --> 26:38.100
Said they were centralizing their files.

26:38.135 --> 26:44.065
They wanted any originals.

26:44.100 --> 26:48.300
Can you remember if you put any
questions in about spatial reasoning?

26:48.335 --> 26:49.799
Why would I do that?

26:49.800 --> 26:52.400
There's no statistical utility
in asking questions

26:52.800 --> 26:55.850
maybe one in ten thousand first
graders could answer.

26:55.885 --> 26:58.900
Well, how would you
explain a question like this, then?

26:58.935 --> 27:00.599
"How can rainbows be seen?

27:00.600 --> 27:04.200
Only when the sun is behind the observer."

27:04.235 --> 27:08.300
This wasn't in the test I sent to ETS.

27:08.335 --> 27:10.299
I design the questions,

27:10.300 --> 27:13.665
I proof the test booklets
they print up,

27:13.700 --> 27:18.700
and then when they send the final
corrected copies, I put them on file.

27:18.735 --> 27:22.567
About how many first graders
took this test?

27:22.602 --> 27:26.400
They administered this in
33 states.

27:26.435 --> 27:31.000
That's over five million children.

27:31.035 --> 27:32.299
Sloane's on his way to Japan.

27:32.300 --> 27:36.400
He plans to stay at a Yakuza-run Ryokan,
the Nyoshi Ginza.

27:36.435 --> 27:38.699
Use the numbers he gave you
and contact Sark.

27:38.700 --> 27:44.600
Tell him we will hand him Sloane the night
before his Alliance meeting.

27:44.635 --> 27:49.100
Tell me you agree with me, that we have
no choice in this.

27:49.135 --> 27:53.765
Of course we have a choice,

27:53.800 --> 27:56.600
and it's a moment I never wanted you
to face.

27:56.635 --> 27:58.599
To kill someone.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.699
I'm not talking about self-defense,

28:00.700 --> 28:03.665
I'm talking about premeditated murder.

28:03.700 --> 28:07.200
To be there when the door closes on
him for the last time.

28:07.235 --> 28:10.465
Knowing you are responsible.

28:10.500 --> 28:16.500
That is something you never came close to
considering before getting to know your mother.

28:22.900 --> 28:28.900
Tokyo

28:38.000 --> 28:39.699
I'm on the grounds.

28:39.700 --> 28:40.299
Good.

28:40.300 --> 28:44.600
My associate just arrived to meet
your father.

28:44.635 --> 28:47.817
U.S. Naval Medical Center

28:47.852 --> 28:50.999
Is that the antidote?

28:51.000 --> 28:52.599
Yes.

28:52.600 --> 28:57.600
However, the briefcase is security coded with
a secondary system wired to a remote detonator.

28:57.635 --> 28:58.799
As I expected.

28:58.800 --> 29:00.999
Only Mr. Sark has the security code.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.300
Until I receive word from him
to release the serum,

29:04.335 --> 29:10.300
the case remains closed.

29:43.200 --> 29:44.899
Reaching the building

29:44.900 --> 29:46.199
Good luck, Sydney.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.000
I don't need you to wish me luck,
you son of a bitch.

29:49.035 --> 29:52.000
That's a wonderful attitude.

31:40.600 --> 31:45.400
Oh... God, I'm tense.

31:45.435 --> 31:50.165
Not a big surprise.

31:50.200 --> 31:55.400
I saw a man die yesterday.

31:55.435 --> 32:01.400
Do you understand?

32:03.900 --> 32:08.765
Yeah.

32:08.800 --> 32:13.065
He was in incredible pain,

32:13.100 --> 32:19.100
but it was the love he had for his
wife that sustained him.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.450
I loved my wife, too.

32:27.485 --> 32:30.500
But I had to take action.

32:30.535 --> 32:36.500
No...

32:39.900 --> 32:43.000
You are so good, do you know that?

32:43.035 --> 32:49.000
Send the ambulance.

32:57.700 --> 32:59.499
It went well.

32:59.500 --> 33:01.899
Look, when I said "Good luck" before,
I wasn't mocking you.

33:01.900 --> 33:07.900
Call in for your man to release the serum.

33:09.300 --> 33:10.799
Hand over the antidote.

33:10.800 --> 33:16.800
The security code is 10-11-92.

33:23.500 --> 33:29.500
You'll stay here until we've tested it.

33:31.300 --> 33:37.300
It was nice working with you.

34:01.600 --> 34:07.600
Los Angeles

34:28.199 --> 34:29.699
What's happening?

34:29.699 --> 34:32.199
You've been asleep for forty hours.

34:32.235 --> 34:33.799
Am I dying?

34:33.800 --> 34:36.199
Almost.

34:36.199 --> 34:39.965
Sydney got the antidote.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.699
The doctors say your blood levels
are looking good.

34:42.735 --> 34:44.899
How did she do it?

34:44.900 --> 34:50.900
She had Sloane killed.

35:45.600 --> 35:48.565
Sydney.

35:48.600 --> 35:52.765
Good morning.

35:52.800 --> 35:56.065
You know Mr. Sark.

35:56.100 --> 35:59.265
I don't think we've ever
been officially introduced.

35:59.300 --> 36:04.900
Mr. Sark is now cooperating with us in our
ongoing search for Derevko and the remains
of her company.

36:04.935 --> 36:06.399
He's cooperating.

36:06.400 --> 36:09.900
This is a strategic alliance,
Agent Bristow.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.299
Debrief him.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.399
Take down everything he knows
about Derevko

36:13.400 --> 36:19.400
and we'll see and decide
about what goes on after that.

36:31.000 --> 36:37.000
Agent Bristow, working with you...

36:37.300 --> 36:40.200
Don't worry. I pulsed the bugs.

36:40.235 --> 36:41.199
We can reminisce.

36:41.200 --> 36:44.265
What are you doing here? How?

36:44.300 --> 36:46.099
I took the ambulance to a
remote location.

36:46.100 --> 36:48.699
And then I revived him.

36:48.734 --> 36:51.299
Here's the situation.

36:51.300 --> 36:53.499
Rambaldi's true aim is a puzzle.

36:53.500 --> 36:56.065
I have certain pieces, you have others.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.800
We'll never solve his mystery,
but together...

36:58.835 --> 37:00.399
together, we cannot fail.

37:00.400 --> 37:03.300
How do I know you have anything
real to offer?

37:03.335 --> 37:05.800
I can prove myself in two ways.

37:05.835 --> 37:07.699
The first is obvious.

37:07.700 --> 37:10.400
I intercepted communications
indicating that

37:10.700 --> 37:14.650
there would be an assassination
attempt on your life.

37:14.685 --> 37:18.565
Now as this conversation proves,
I've prevented that.

37:18.600 --> 37:21.400
How do I know you didn't plan
the attempt in the first place?

37:21.435 --> 37:27.400
Which brings me to my second
piece of information.

37:34.800 --> 37:36.699
What was on the piece of paper?

37:36.700 --> 37:42.700
I'm afraid that's need-to-know.

37:48.400 --> 37:54.400
I got it from here, thanks.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.765
You asked me some questions.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.800
I told you I'd answer them
if you helped me.

38:22.835 --> 38:26.065
You did help me

38:26.100 --> 38:30.500
and I thank you for that.

38:30.535 --> 38:34.900
I didn't do it for you.

38:40.200 --> 38:44.550
I'm trying to live a normal life,

38:44.585 --> 38:48.865
which was always hard given what I do

38:48.900 --> 38:54.250
but it's gotten harder
since I met your daughter.

38:54.285 --> 38:59.600
It's not that knowing her
hasn't made my life better.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.465
It has.

39:03.500 --> 39:09.500
But it's also made it that much worse.

39:10.600 --> 39:12.199
I think I've said enough.

39:12.200 --> 39:14.299
The problem, Mr. Vaughn,

39:14.300 --> 39:18.600
is that to the one person who matters,

39:18.635 --> 39:20.699
you haven't said anything.

39:20.700 --> 39:23.265
Listen, this may not mean
anything to you.

39:23.300 --> 39:26.365
This may not be something you can understand
or appreciate, but we have rules.

39:26.400 --> 39:31.200
Very clear and important rules that govern the
relationship between a handler and his asset.

39:31.235 --> 39:37.200
And between a man and a woman?

39:50.600 --> 39:58.500
Hi.

40:07.800 --> 40:10.800
Thank you.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.465
I heard about Sark.

40:26.500 --> 40:32.500
Sloane actually brought Sark to the
Alliance and presented him as their new ally.

40:32.535 --> 40:34.099
How did that go over?

40:34.100 --> 40:37.065
Apparently, Sark was a big hit.

40:37.100 --> 40:43.100
And thanks to me, Sloane's standing
has never been higher.

40:48.000 --> 40:52.300
I understand you met Alice.

40:52.335 --> 40:54.499
She seems nice.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.799
Yeah, she is.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.365
She's a good person.

40:59.400 --> 41:02.200
We have a lot of history, we're trying to...

41:02.235 --> 41:03.699
You know we broke up.

41:03.700 --> 41:04.899
Yeah, you mentioned that.

41:04.900 --> 41:08.200
Yeah. A couple of months later, we saw each
other at a friend's and...

41:08.235 --> 41:09.399
You don't have to explain.

41:09.400 --> 41:11.865
No, I know, but I want to.

41:11.900 --> 41:14.400
Because, if things were the
other way around...

41:14.435 --> 41:19.567
Seriously...

41:19.602 --> 41:24.700
don't explain.

41:29.200 --> 41:35.200
I'll see you tomorrow.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.799
Jack briefed me.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.600
He and Sydney broke protocol but
I'm glad it worked out.

41:49.635 --> 41:55.600
Excuse me.
