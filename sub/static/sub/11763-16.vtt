WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:02.173
HEY, SEXY.

00:02.173 --> 00:03.734
(all) HEY.

00:03.734 --> 00:06.237
WOW. WHEN YOU SAY THINGS
LIKE "HEY, SEXY,"

00:06.237 --> 00:09.080
AND YOU SEE WHO ANSWERS,
THAT'S A GREAT SELF-ESTEEM TEST.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.042
THAT WON'T WORK.
HEY, DUMMY.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.414
YEAH?
YO, I HEARD YOU CALL ME
FROM OUT BACK.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.386
WOW, A TWOFER.

00:15.386 --> 00:19.520
YOU CAN REALLY TELL WHO IS
A MORNING PERSON AND WHO IS NOT.

00:19.520 --> 00:22.022
ME, I WAKE UP READY
TO SEIZE THE DAY.

00:22.022 --> 00:25.226
I'M LIKE, COME ON, DAY!
I GOTCHA!

00:25.226 --> 00:28.429
SHE LITERALLY SHOOTS AWAKE
LIKE THIS. "HELLO!"

00:28.429 --> 00:29.800
THEN SHE PELTS ME WITH QUESTIONS

00:29.800 --> 00:32.263
LIKE "WHY DO YOU EAT
SO MANY CARBS?

00:32.263 --> 00:35.166
WHAT'S AN AARDVARK? DO YOU THINK
WE'LL EVER LIVE IN LONDON?" NO.
I DON'T KNOW.

00:35.166 --> 00:39.540
ANDY SEEMS LIKE HE WOULD BE
A MORNING PERSON.
(operatically) в™Є GUILTY в™Є

00:39.540 --> 00:42.073
AND THAT'S FOR THE REST
OF MY LIFE.

00:42.073 --> 00:44.815
ELLIE IS NOT A MORNING PERSON...
OR A NIGHT PERSON.

00:44.815 --> 00:48.449
WELL, THERE'S REALLY ONLY, LIKE,
SEVEN MINUTES DURING THE DAY

00:48.449 --> 00:51.152
THAT YOU ARE FUN TO BE AROUND.
THE BEST PART IS YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN THEY'RE COMING. NOT NOW.

00:51.152 --> 00:52.223
OKAY.

00:52.223 --> 00:54.085
TRAV WAKES UP HAPPY.

00:54.085 --> 00:56.087
MAYBE BECAUSE SOMETIMES
HE SLEEPWALKS

00:56.087 --> 00:58.559
AND HE GETS FRISKY
WITH WEIRD STUFF. REMEMBER?

00:58.559 --> 01:01.732
IT STARTED WHEN HE WAS 12
WITH OUR CHRISTMAS TREE.

01:01.732 --> 01:03.734
OH, HE WENT TO TOWN
ON THAT THING.

01:03.734 --> 01:05.736
OOH, I LOVE CHRISTMAS.
(chuckles)

01:05.736 --> 01:08.399
I HATE THAT
I JUST DID THAT.

01:08.399 --> 01:12.203
SINCE I GREW UP IN FOSTER HOMES,
I WAKE UP SWINGING.

01:12.203 --> 01:14.205
IT COMES IN PRETTY HANDY,
THOUGH,

01:14.205 --> 01:16.277
IF I'M
IN SOME STRANGE GUY'S HOUSE.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.279
I'M LIKE... "BACK OFF, DUDE!"

01:18.279 --> 01:21.081
YOU SHOULD WRITE THAT DOWN
FOR WHEN YOU HAVE A DAUGHTER.

01:21.081 --> 01:25.186
ELLIE! STAN'S CRYING FOR YOU!
OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU HAVE A KID.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.118
WHAT?! SERIOUSLY?
SHE DOES NOT.

01:27.118 --> 01:29.290
NO, SHE DOES.
BYE, LOSERS.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.462
(Laurie and Jules) BYE!
LATER.

01:31.462 --> 01:33.124
WHY DID I ANSWER?

01:33.124 --> 01:36.397
OKAY, SO WE READ FOUR BOOKS.
WE PLAYED TRAINS.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.399
NOW HERE'S
YOUR COLORING BOOK, SWEETIE,

01:38.399 --> 01:40.701
AND MOMMY IS GONNA BE RIGHT...

01:40.701 --> 01:42.733
OVER... HERE.

01:42.733 --> 01:46.377
WOW. MEN START BEING NEEDY
SO YOUNG.

01:46.377 --> 01:48.809
GRAYSON'S STILL LIKE THAT.

01:48.809 --> 01:51.812
BUT INSTEAD OF LETTING HIM
NUZZLE UP WITH MY BOOBS,

01:51.812 --> 01:53.814
I LET HIM...
NO, IT'S THE SAME THING.

01:53.814 --> 01:56.847
HE DIVES RIGHT IN
LIKE HE OWNS THE PLACE.
THAT'S BAD.

01:56.847 --> 02:00.120
LUCKILY, STAN SPENDS
A LOT OF TIME WITH THE NANNY

02:00.120 --> 02:03.294
WHILE WE GET TO POUND GRAPE.
THAT'S MY NEW SLANG.

02:03.294 --> 02:05.856
I LIKE IT. YOU LOVE IT?
NO.

02:05.856 --> 02:08.359
YOU GUYS ALWAYS JOKE
THAT I'M NOT WITH STAN.

02:08.359 --> 02:10.361
EVERY DAY I'M AWAKE
AT LEAST 12 HOURS.

02:10.361 --> 02:12.203
I SPEND THREE HOURS WITH YOU,

02:12.203 --> 02:15.166
FIVE MINUTES WITH THE BALD GUY
WHO SHARES MY BATHROOM,

02:15.166 --> 02:17.668
AND THE REST OF THE TIME
IS WITH STAN.

02:17.668 --> 02:19.870
THAT IS A CRAP-TON
OF MOMMY TIME.

02:19.870 --> 02:22.513
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HARD IT IS.
OH, COME ON.
TRAVIS WAS A BABY ONCE, TOO.

02:22.513 --> 02:24.515
JULES, YOU HAD TRAVIS
IN YOUR 20s.

02:24.515 --> 02:27.518
YOU HAD TONS OF ENERGY,
AND PLUS, YOU WERE TOO DUMB

02:27.518 --> 02:30.521
TO WORRY YOU WERE SCREWING UP
YOUR KID FOR LIFE.
(laughs) I WAS SO DUMB.

02:30.521 --> 02:35.556
I USED TO LET HIM USE
MY PILL BOTTLE AS A RATTLE.
HAVING A BABY IN YOUR 40s
IS EXHAUSTING,

02:35.556 --> 02:38.559
AND PEOPLE WILL JUDGE YOU IF YOU
KEEP A SIPPY CUP FULL OF WINE

02:38.559 --> 02:41.392
IN THE STROLLER
SO YOU CAN POUND GRAPE.
HA! I KNEW YOU LOVED IT.

02:41.392 --> 02:43.694
I DO.
LOOK, WHEN I HAD TRAVIS,

02:43.694 --> 02:46.637
I WAS A SCARED, BROKE KID,
AND BOBBY WAS NEVER AROUND.

02:46.637 --> 02:50.341
BUT YOU'RE SAYING
THAT IT'S HARDERNOW

02:50.341 --> 02:53.244
WITH A NANNY
AND A DEVOTED HUSBAND.

02:53.244 --> 02:55.246
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR UNDERSTANDING.

02:55.246 --> 02:58.178
(whispers) WOW. OKAY.

02:58.178 --> 03:01.412
YOU KNOW, ALL THAT
"MORNING PEOPLE" TALK

03:01.412 --> 03:04.885
MADE ME THINK,
SINCE SMITH AND I BROKE UP,

03:04.885 --> 03:08.859
I HAVE NOT WOKEN UPONCE
NEXT TO SOME RANDOM GUY

03:08.859 --> 03:11.222
THAT I JUST MET
THE NIGHT BEFORE.

03:11.222 --> 03:13.524
FEELS LIKE THATSHOULDN'T
MAKE A WOMAN SAD.

03:13.524 --> 03:16.227
WELL, YOU JUST GOTTA
GET BACK OUT THERE, GIRL.

03:16.227 --> 03:18.799
YOU NEED TO GO HIT IT
AND QUIT IT. (laughs)

03:18.799 --> 03:21.201
TOOT IT AND BOOT IT.
WHIP IT AND SKIP IT.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.404
WAX IT AND TAX IT.
MOTHER IT AND SMOTHER IT.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.576
BOP IT AND DROP IT.

03:25.576 --> 03:27.608
CHUCK IT
AND... RECHUCK IT.

03:27.608 --> 03:31.242
YOURS DON'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

03:31.242 --> 03:33.744
ALL RIGHT. I'M DOING IT!
OH! I JUST...

03:33.744 --> 03:36.547
I REALLY NEED A WINGMAN.
CAN'T BE MY FRIEND TINA.

03:36.547 --> 03:38.249
SHE'S SUPER PREGNANT

03:38.249 --> 03:40.551
AND DOESN'T WANNA HAVE
ANOTHER BABY IN A CLUB.

03:40.551 --> 03:43.724
YOU KNOW, I'VE NEVER BEEN
A WINGMAN. LET ME DO THIS.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.756
DONE AND DONE.
TOMORROW NIGHT IT ISON.

03:45.756 --> 03:47.928
IT'SSOON...
IF ELLIE SAYS IT'S ON.

03:47.928 --> 03:49.900
IT MAY NOT BE ON.
OH.

03:49.900 --> 03:53.964
HEY, BOBBY, WHAT TIME ARE YOU
PICKING ME UP FOR GOLF TOMORROW?
5:30 IN THE A.M.

03:53.964 --> 03:57.508
YEAH, I NEED TO PRACTICE
FOR THAT PGA TOURNEY.

03:57.508 --> 03:59.940
THEY LET ME ON THIS GREAT COURSE
FOR FREE IF I GET THERE

03:59.940 --> 04:02.973
BEFORE 6:00.
IT'S AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY.

04:02.973 --> 04:05.676
COOL. HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU GONE?

04:05.676 --> 04:07.978
NONE. CAN'T GET UP.
KEEP HITTING THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

04:07.978 --> 04:09.980
BUT I GOT DOG TRAVIS ON IT NOW.

04:09.980 --> 04:12.252
(alarm clock beeping)
(Tokyo Police Club)
в™Є I'M ON YOUR TEAM в™Є

04:12.252 --> 04:14.455
в™Є BUT I NEVER KNOW
WHEN YOU'RE NOT в™Є
(beeping stops)

04:14.455 --> 04:15.826
SNOOZE.

04:15.826 --> 04:19.890
(whimpers)
в™Є YOU NEVER TELL ANYTHING
TO ME в™Є

04:19.890 --> 04:20.991
SNOOZE.

04:20.991 --> 04:22.893
в™Є BUT ONLY FOR A WHILE,
OF COURSE в™Є

04:22.893 --> 04:25.536
в™Є YOU NEVER USE WORDS
YOU CAN'T AFFORD в™Є

04:25.536 --> 04:27.968
в™Є A HOUSE OF CARDS
AND IT'S A SIGN в™Є

04:27.968 --> 04:29.970
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
OH, RIGHT, GOLF.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.973
SHOULD I LEARN TO PLAY GOLF?
DO WE DO ENOUGH TOGETHER?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.476
WHY DON'T WE EVER USE
MY JACUZZI?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.648
в™Є SO WAIT UP в™Є

04:37.648 --> 04:39.650
в™Є YOU NEVER GET NERVOUS
ANYMORE в™Є

04:39.650 --> 04:41.482
в™Є WHAT DID YOU WANT ME TO SAY? в™Є

04:41.482 --> 04:43.654
UGH.

04:43.654 --> 04:45.055
I'M UP.

04:45.055 --> 04:49.520
(Stan crying) MAMA!

04:49.520 --> 04:52.763
в™Єв™Єв™Є

04:56.397 --> 04:58.298
YOU SHOULD BUY THAT THING
BREAKFAST.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.471
в™Є INSIDE THE LINES,
GOTTA CATCH 'EM IN A PAPER CUP в™Є

05:00.471 --> 05:02.002
(tires screech)

05:02.002 --> 05:04.505
COME ON, MAN.
WE CAN STILL MAKE IT.

05:04.505 --> 05:07.077
OHH! HEY, COMING THROUGH!
COMING THROUGH, BABY!

05:07.077 --> 05:10.381
COMING THROUGH!
COMING THROUGH!

05:10.381 --> 05:13.444
SORRY, BOBBY. IT'S 6:05.
I CAN'T LET YOU ON. BOB--BOB--

05:13.444 --> 05:16.046
BOBBY. BOBBY!

05:17.918 --> 05:19.950
OHH! WHOA.

05:19.950 --> 05:22.593
WHOO! DID I WIN?
(birds squawking)

05:22.593 --> 05:24.925
NOBODY WON. NOBODY WON.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.998
WHY WON'T YOU LET LAURIE BE
ANDY'S WINGMAN?

05:27.998 --> 05:31.562
DID ANDY ASK YOU
TO CHANGE MY MIND?
(chuckles) NO.

05:31.562 --> 05:34.665
TELL HER I'LL TAKE EMBARRASSING
PHOTOS OF DRUNK LAURIE FOR HER.

05:34.665 --> 05:37.808
YEAH, AND TELL HER THAT I'LL
GET, LIKE, JURY DUTY DRUNK.

05:37.808 --> 05:39.810
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

05:39.810 --> 05:42.012
(door opens and closes)
NOTHING.

05:42.012 --> 05:43.444
(Grayson) HEY, HOTTIE.
(both) HEY.

05:43.444 --> 05:44.975
WHY DIDN'T I SAY ANYTHING?

05:44.975 --> 05:47.648
OH, I WAS ACTUALLY
TALKING TO THE MIRROR.

05:47.648 --> 05:51.422
YOU LOOK GOOD WET, PLAYBOY.
YEAH, I KNOW THIS. (chuckles)

05:51.422 --> 05:54.084
IF THERE IS A RIDICULOUS CUBAN
HIDING OVER THERE,

05:54.084 --> 05:57.388
YOU CAN TELL HIM THAT IT'S FINE
IF HE WANTS TO GO DANCING

05:57.388 --> 05:58.889
WITH TRAMP FACE TONIGHT.

05:58.889 --> 06:00.030
THANKS, BABY!

06:00.030 --> 06:01.532
YEAH, ME, TOO!

06:01.532 --> 06:03.834
I WILL STAY HOME
AND DO A DANCE--

06:03.834 --> 06:04.995
THE DANCE OF MOTHERHOOD.

06:04.995 --> 06:07.498
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
TO RAISE A KID.

06:07.498 --> 06:10.000
WOMEN HAVE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR HUNDREDS OF YEARS.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.872
(whistles)

06:11.872 --> 06:15.546
THOUSANDS.
YOU REALLY THINK YOU COULD
HANDLE STAN FOR ONE NIGHT?

06:15.546 --> 06:17.548
I COULD DO IT
WITHOUT A NANNY

06:17.548 --> 06:19.550
AND BOTH HANDS TIED
BEHIND MY BACK.

06:21.051 --> 06:23.383
THAT WAS FAST.
OH, HE NEEDS TO BE CHANGED.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.556
HEY, LAURIE,
WILL YOU GRAB ME A DIAPER?

06:25.556 --> 06:30.991
LAURIE?
WHERE THE HELL DID YOU GO?

06:30.991 --> 06:35.966
в™Єв™Єв™Є

06:42.633 --> 06:44.034
I'M HAPPY TO STAY AND HELP.

06:44.034 --> 06:47.037
THE DEAL WAS NO NANNY.
NOW IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD HIM

06:47.037 --> 06:50.040
WHILE I PUT THIS DANGEROUS STUFF
INTO THE PANTRY...

06:50.040 --> 06:52.042
THIS BRГ»LГ©E TORCH
IS PROBABLY ALL RIGHT.

06:52.042 --> 06:54.845
IT TAKES, LIKE, FIVE THINGS
TO LIGHT IT.
(click, flame hisses)

06:54.845 --> 06:57.988
NO, IT'S N-NOT SAFE. OKAY.
WHY DOES YOUR PANTRY
LOCK FROM THE INSIDE?

06:57.988 --> 07:00.020
WELL, WHEN TRAVIS WENT AWAY,

07:00.020 --> 07:02.192
I TURNED IT
INTO A PANTRY/SAFE ROOM.

07:02.192 --> 07:05.195
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ENOUGH TUNA
AND MERLOT TO LAST ME TWO WEEKS.

07:05.195 --> 07:07.928
BUT WHERE WOULD I PEE?
OH. I'LL JUST GO

07:07.928 --> 07:11.802
IN THE EMPTY BOTTLES. YAY.
ELLIE WROTE DOWN EMERGENCY
NUMBERS. AND HERE'S HIS EpiPen.

07:11.802 --> 07:14.134
HE'S ALLERGIC TO EVERYTHING
ON ELLIE'S LIST.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.806
HE'S ALLERGIC TO TELEMUNDO?

07:15.806 --> 07:17.808
I THINK THAT'S MORE FOR ME.

07:17.808 --> 07:19.810
OH, IT'S ALMOST
STAN'S BATH TIME.

07:19.810 --> 07:22.142
CAREFUL. WHEN HE GETS WET,
HE GETS A LITTLE MEAN.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.144
ROSA, I'M GREAT WITH KIDS.

07:24.144 --> 07:26.847
YOU KNOW, MY SON ALMOST MADE
HONOR ROLL... TWICE.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.980
(whispers) I'M A BIT
OF A MARY POPPINS.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.653
HELL, YEAH. I'LL GET SOMEONE
TO COVER FOR ME,

07:32.653 --> 07:33.954
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE TALKING...

07:33.954 --> 07:37.958
(lowered voice) ABOUT A LITTLE
AFTERNOON ACTION. (chuckles)

07:37.958 --> 07:41.932
ACTION--BATH UPSTAIRS.
HE LOVES THE WATER.

07:41.932 --> 07:44.464
THIS IS WHY MEN CHEAT.
(makes whooshing sound)

07:44.464 --> 07:45.966
(Stan giggling)

07:45.966 --> 07:48.669
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MISSED GOLF
AGAIN TODAY.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.672
IT'S MY OWN FAULT FOR HAVING
THAT SNOOZEBURGER AROUND.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.144
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK
ON THIS ALL DAY.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.846
HEY, YOU'RE MY BOY.

07:55.846 --> 07:58.148
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH,

07:58.148 --> 08:01.051
I'M JUMPING IN WHETHER
YOU ASKED ME TO OR NOT.
THANKS.

08:01.051 --> 08:04.054
SO WHAT YOU UP TO THIS WEEKEND?
YOU STAYING IN,

08:04.054 --> 08:06.857
OR YOU GONNA TAKE YOUR LAUNDRY
HAMPER OUT ON THE TOWN?

08:06.857 --> 08:09.520
TERRIFIC. WHO ELSE DID KEVIN
E-MAIL THAT VIDEO TO?

08:09.520 --> 08:12.192
OH, TRAV.

08:12.192 --> 08:13.894
NOW THAT HE'S DRY,

08:13.894 --> 08:18.168
MAYBE WE CAN CUT
LITTLE WOLVERINE'S NAILS.

08:18.168 --> 08:20.230
OH, MY GOSH.
(babbles)

08:20.230 --> 08:22.002
NO.
WHERE--WHERE YOU GOIN'?

08:22.002 --> 08:24.174
WELL, GO GET HIM.

08:24.174 --> 08:26.637
THIS IS OUR CRAZY NIGHT OUT?
A WINE BAR?

08:26.637 --> 08:28.839
I PRACTICED MY CLUB CALL.

08:28.839 --> 08:31.912
(high-pitched voice)
в™Є WHOO-WHOO в™Є
HEY. NOT HERE.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.013
SORRY.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.015
JUST WAIT. ONCE A MONTH,

08:35.015 --> 08:39.019
THEY TURN THIS WHOLE PLAZA
INTO A CLUB. IT'SSICK!

08:39.019 --> 08:41.852
LAST YEAR, MY FRIEND NEZZIE
GOT TRAMPLED.

08:41.852 --> 08:45.926
BUT IT'S OKAY. THE COUNTY PAID
FOR HER TO GET METAL LEGS. OKAY.

08:45.926 --> 08:48.028
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR WINGMAN RULES?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.529
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING ALONE,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.832
I STAND BEHIND YOU AND GO,
"DAMN!"

08:51.832 --> 08:54.234
YES, BECAUSE ASS WORSHIP
IS CONTAGIOUS.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.067
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE?

08:57.067 --> 08:59.039
MY NIGHT'S NOT DONE
TILL YOU GET SOME.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.741
WHOO! (laughs)

09:00.741 --> 09:03.674
HI.
IT'S SUCH A GORGEOUS NIGHT.

09:03.674 --> 09:06.817
I HAVE NO KID, WAYNE.
SHIRAZ ME.

09:06.817 --> 09:09.119
LAURIE, YOU ARE ROCKIN'
THOSE JEANS. HUH, GIRLFRIEND?

09:09.119 --> 09:11.582
(gasps) WHY IS IT BEING NICE?

09:11.582 --> 09:14.184
ARE THESE
THE GOLDEN SEVEN MINUTES?

09:14.184 --> 09:16.086
BOO, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

09:16.086 --> 09:18.128
THEY ARE!
ALL RIGHT, WINGMAN.

09:18.128 --> 09:19.930
(singsongy) IT'S TIME.

09:19.930 --> 09:21.832
(dance music playing)
WHERE'D THEY COME FROM?

09:21.832 --> 09:24.164
SWEETIE, HOLD MY HAND,
AND LET'S KISS A LITTLE.
OH, I AM SO SORRY, LAURIE,

09:24.164 --> 09:27.297
BUT WHEN ELLIE'S LIKE THIS,
I HAVE TO--
TOO LATE. NOT NOW.

09:27.297 --> 09:29.039
LET'S DANCE.

09:29.039 --> 09:30.140
(squeals)

09:30.140 --> 09:32.773
(clears throat)

09:32.773 --> 09:34.775
HEY, MOM.
(lowered voice) SHH!

09:34.775 --> 09:38.078
GRAYSON THINKS I'M LOOKING
FOR STAN'S PACIFIER.
HELLO.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.811
(normal voice, singsongy)
FOUND IT!
HEY, STINKY PANTS.

09:40.811 --> 09:43.313
HEY.
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE HIDING.

09:43.313 --> 09:46.586
ELLIE WAS RIGHT.
THIS IS HARDER IN YOUR 40s.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.119
I MEAN, I'M EXHAUSTED,

09:49.119 --> 09:52.092
AND WHEN YOU WERE A BABY,
I WAS TOO DUMB TO CARE.

09:52.092 --> 09:55.095
I USED TO TELL YOU TO GO HIDE,
AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR YOU,

09:55.095 --> 09:59.029
I'D WATCH TV
AND CALL MY GIRLFRIENDS.
WELL, THAT EXPLAINS
MY DEEP DISTRUST TOWARDS WOMEN.

09:59.029 --> 10:01.171
DON'T EVER LOSE THAT, BUDDY.
IT'S A GIFT.

10:01.171 --> 10:03.804
STAN SHOULD BE SLEEPING NOW,
BUT GENIUS HERE

10:03.804 --> 10:05.806
GAVE HIM CHOCOLATE-COVERED
ESPRESSO BEANS.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.878
I THOUGHT THEY WERE RAISINS.

10:07.878 --> 10:10.040
AND I WANTED HIM TO LIKE ME.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.312
HOW ARE WE GONNA TIRE HIM OUT
WITHOUT HAVING

10:12.312 --> 10:15.315
TO CHASE HIM
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD?
I CAN BUILD HIM A PLAY AREA,

10:15.315 --> 10:19.089
REMEMBER, TRAV,
LIKE WE DID LAST YEAR, HUH?
OH, NO, THANK YOU.
NO, THANK YOU.

10:19.089 --> 10:21.852
CAREFUL. HE'S GOT
HIS MOTHER'S TALONS.

10:21.852 --> 10:23.994
(fusses)
IS ANYONE IN MORE HELL
THAN ME?

10:23.994 --> 10:25.826
(Andy) LAURIE, WHERE ARE YOU?

10:25.826 --> 10:33.063
(dance music playing)

10:33.063 --> 10:37.307
(acoustic guitar playing)

10:37.307 --> 10:39.970
(dance music playing)

10:39.970 --> 10:41.641
(acoustic guitar playing)

10:41.641 --> 10:43.313
(dance music playing)

10:43.313 --> 10:45.015
(acoustic guitar playing)

10:45.015 --> 10:46.316
(dance music playing)

10:46.316 --> 10:48.348
(acoustic guitar playing)
NO WAY.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.121
I AM ALL ABOUT ACOUSTICS.
PINOT?
(cork pops)

10:51.121 --> 10:53.123
OH.

10:53.123 --> 10:54.084
(keys jangle)
CAR'S FIXED.

10:54.084 --> 10:56.086
(high-pitched voice)
SWEET!

10:56.086 --> 10:59.289
(normal voice)
WHAT'S WITH THE MIRROR?
WHEN THE 5:00 A.M. SUN

10:59.289 --> 11:02.362
HITS THE BAD BOY HERE TO GO
THROUGHTHATWINDOW THERE...

11:02.362 --> 11:05.195
ANDHITS RIGHT ON THE "X,"

11:05.195 --> 11:06.737
WAKING ME.

11:06.737 --> 11:09.039
WHAT IF THE PILLOW MOVES?

11:09.039 --> 11:11.041
(laughs)

11:11.041 --> 11:14.174
YOU KNOW, I COULD
JUST COME WAKE YOU UP.
I NEED TO DO THIS ON MY OWN,
TRAV.

11:14.174 --> 11:18.208
OH, IS THIS ONE OF THOSE TIMES
WHEN YOU TAKE SOMETHING TINY

11:18.208 --> 11:20.711
AND THEN SAY HOW IT MEANS
SOMETHING MORE PROFOUND?

11:20.711 --> 11:24.054
MY FAILURE TO WAKE UP SHOWS
HOW I BLOW ALL MY CHANCES

11:24.054 --> 11:25.185
FOR A BETTER LIFE.
YEAH, I CALLED IT.

11:25.185 --> 11:28.088
CAN YOU NAME ANOTHER PERSON
WHO GETS IN HIS OWN WAY

11:28.088 --> 11:30.190
MORE THAN I DO?
GARY BUSEY.

11:30.190 --> 11:32.723
TRUE. STILL, I HAVE TO WALK
THIS ROAD ALONE, SON.

11:32.723 --> 11:34.324
(dance music playing)

11:34.324 --> 11:37.097
(loudly)
YOU KNOW WHAT, DOUG?

11:37.097 --> 11:40.100
I AM PISSED THAT THEY JUST
PLAYED A MILEY CYRUS SONG,

11:40.100 --> 11:42.402
AND EVERYONE KNEW THE LYRICS!
I GOTTA GO!

11:42.402 --> 11:43.804
EXCUSE ME!

11:43.804 --> 11:46.176
TOO MUCH BODY SPRAY. AAH!

11:46.176 --> 11:49.179
(acoustic guitar playing)
SORRY I BAILED.
IT WAS TOO MUCH.

11:49.179 --> 11:53.083
IGET WHYYOU
DIDN'T LIKE IT.

11:53.083 --> 11:55.115
BUT, ANDY, WHY DIDN'TI?

11:55.115 --> 11:57.087
IT HAS ALL
OF MY FAVORITE THINGS--

11:57.087 --> 11:58.789
STICKY FLOORS, SHINY SHIRTS,

11:58.789 --> 12:01.151
WEIRD, RICH RUSSIAN DUDES
WHO SAY...

12:01.151 --> 12:04.154
(imitates Russian accent)
YOU WANT TO MAKE DANCE WITH ME?

12:04.154 --> 12:06.226
YOU WERE IN LOVE WITH SMITH.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.158
YOU GOT A TASTE
OF SOMETHING REAL,

12:08.158 --> 12:11.161
SO FROM NOW ON, GOING OUT TO
CLUBS LOOKING FOR ONE-NIGHTERS

12:11.161 --> 12:14.164
ISN'T GONNA CUT IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

12:14.164 --> 12:18.268
FINE. GO BACK OUT THERE.
YEAH, I WILL.

12:18.268 --> 12:20.510
(dance music playing)

12:20.510 --> 12:25.015
PAID THE BOUNCER 20 BUCKS
TO LET ME TAKE MY SHIRT OFF.

12:25.015 --> 12:27.117
(acoustic guitar playing)

12:27.117 --> 12:30.150
WAYNE...
GIVE ME MY PINOT.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.123
WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

12:33.123 --> 12:36.126
WELL, I'M ALREADY HAPPIER NOW
THAT I'VE DRESSED YOU TWO

12:36.126 --> 12:37.828
IN MATCHING JAMMIES.

12:37.828 --> 12:39.489
PLUS BEHOLD
THE WORLD'S BEST BABY FORT.

12:39.489 --> 12:41.461
LOOKS MORE LIKE
A BABY PRISON.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.895
IT'S AN INESCAPABLE FORT,
LIKE ALCATRAZ.

12:44.895 --> 12:47.337
SO YOU GUYS HAVING FUN
OVER THERE?

12:47.337 --> 12:49.970
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.202
WE'RE JUST SITTING BACK
RELAXING

12:52.202 --> 12:53.974
WHILE HE PLAYS
IN HIS BABY PRISON.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.775
FORT.
BABY FORT.

12:55.775 --> 12:57.948
BETTER BE CAREFUL.
THAT KID'S LIKE HOUDINI.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.180
HE CAN GET OUT OF ANYTHING.
(imitates explosion)

13:00.180 --> 13:01.181
WE'RE FINE.

13:01.181 --> 13:04.915
THAT KID AIN'T GOING NOWHERE.
(babbling)

13:04.915 --> 13:06.216
(door locks)

13:06.216 --> 13:08.058
OH! HE LOCKED IT!
(door rattles)

13:08.058 --> 13:11.321
(laughs) THAT WAS SO COOL.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE IN THERE?

13:11.321 --> 13:14.024
OH, NOTHING. JUST, YOU KNOW,
ALL MY KNIVES,

13:14.024 --> 13:17.027
A HALF A BOTTLE OF MERLOT,
AND A PUSH-BUTTON FIRE MACHINE.

13:17.027 --> 13:19.269
STAN!
STAN! STAN, COME OUT!

13:19.269 --> 13:21.501
COME ON, BABY!
UNLOCK IT!

13:28.278 --> 13:30.080
SO HOW'S IT GOING WITH STAN?

13:30.080 --> 13:31.381
WHO'S STAN? BOOM.

13:31.381 --> 13:34.915
THAT'S HOW EASY IT IS.
I FORGOT HE EVEN EXISTS.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.086
(trickling)

13:36.086 --> 13:37.247
IS THAT BLOOD?

13:37.247 --> 13:40.150
EXCUSE ME.
I HAVE A ROAST IN THE OVEN.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.993
(lowered voice) WHAT?!
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S RED WINE.

13:42.993 --> 13:45.255
OHH. WELL, NO!
THAT'S STILL BAD!

13:45.255 --> 13:47.257
HE'S HOLDING
A JAR OF PEANUT BUTTER.

13:47.257 --> 13:49.329
IS THAT ON
HIS ALLERGY OF DEATH LIST?

13:49.329 --> 13:51.561
OKAY, LISTEN.
IF HE OPENS THAT JAR,

13:51.561 --> 13:54.264
YOU BREAK THAT DOOR DOWN
AND STAB HIM WITH THIS.

13:54.264 --> 13:57.037
I DON'T WANNA STAB A BABY.
WIMP!

13:57.037 --> 13:59.209
(cell phone beeps)

13:59.209 --> 14:04.114
H--YES? 9-1-1? HI. UM, UH,
THEREMAYBE AN EMERGENCY.

14:04.114 --> 14:07.117
UM, I'M NOT SURE YET.
CAN YOU JUST HOLD ON A SECOND?

14:07.117 --> 14:09.479
HE PUT IT DOWN.
FALSE ALARM, FELLAS.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.452
I KNEW YOU'D NEVER MAKE
A ROAST.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.455
HEY, NEW MILESTONE. STAN KNOWS
HOW TO LOCK DOORS NOW.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.888
STANNIE...

14:17.888 --> 14:20.961
YOU WANT A GOLDFISH CRACKER?
(crackers rattle)

14:20.961 --> 14:23.533
(door creaks)
WELL, COME HERE!
THERE YOU GO.

14:23.533 --> 14:29.499
WELL, I COULD'VEBRIBEDHIM,
BUT I'M A GOOD MOM.
(Stan babbling)

14:29.499 --> 14:32.002
OH, REALLY?
YEAH.

14:32.002 --> 14:35.275
I USED TO LOVE CLUBS
LIKE THAT.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.876
NOW THEY SUCK.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.950
I DON'T KNOW WHO I AM
ANYMORE.

14:39.950 --> 14:41.952
SO YOU'RE DONE GOING
TO CRAPPY CLUBS

14:41.952 --> 14:44.114
AND HOPPING INTO BED
WITH GUYS.

14:44.114 --> 14:47.217
IT MEANS YOU'RE GROWING UP.
PLUS IT REDUCES THE ODDS

14:47.217 --> 14:50.060
OF YOU BEING RANDOMLY MURDERED
BY, LIKE, HALF.

14:50.060 --> 14:51.321
I GUESS.

14:51.321 --> 14:53.323
THINK OF HOW HORRIBLE
IT WAS

14:53.323 --> 14:55.325
TO WAKE UP
IN SOME STRANGE APARTMENT,

14:55.325 --> 14:57.027
WEARING YESTERDAY'S CLOTHES

14:57.027 --> 14:59.369
AND YOU HAVE TO DO
THE WALK OF SHAME.

14:59.369 --> 15:01.371
I USED TO LOVE THAT WALK.

15:01.371 --> 15:04.074
ALL THE JUDGMENTAL LOOKS
THAT I GOT FROM PEOPLE

15:04.074 --> 15:05.375
MADE ME FEEL ALIVE.

15:05.375 --> 15:08.378
IT WASN'T A WALK OF SHAME.
IT WAS A WALK OFAWESOME!

15:08.378 --> 15:11.081
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW,
ANDY?

15:11.081 --> 15:14.084
MEET SOMEONE GREAT, GET MARRIED,
AND HAVE A COUPLE OF KIDS?

15:14.084 --> 15:16.616
BLECH. WHAT'S THE POINT
OF LIFE THEN?

15:16.616 --> 15:19.389
THAT KINDA IS
THE POINT OF LIFE.
(sighs)

15:19.389 --> 15:21.591
WANT A COFFEE?

15:21.591 --> 15:25.295
GET ME A LARGEY SOY EXTRA CAP...
(makes hissing sound)

15:25.295 --> 15:26.997
(yawns loudly)

15:26.997 --> 15:28.959
DUDE.

15:28.959 --> 15:32.232
IT'S ONLY 9:30.
PRETTY WEAK.

15:33.363 --> 15:35.465
(yawning)
AND IT'S CONTAGIOUS.

15:35.465 --> 15:37.607
(yawns loudly)

15:37.607 --> 15:39.609
(yawns loudly)

15:39.609 --> 15:42.712
ALL RIGHT, NO SNOOZEBURGERS
TOMORROW, BUDDY.

15:42.712 --> 15:45.715
BUT... I'LL DAB ON
A LITTLE B-B-Q SAUCE,

15:45.715 --> 15:47.717
AND WHEN THAT ALARM GOES OFF,

15:47.717 --> 15:50.680
I REALLY WANT YOU
TO GET IN THERE AND WAKE ME.

15:50.680 --> 15:52.682
NIGHTY NIGHT. (grunts)
AHH.

15:56.026 --> 15:58.958
OH. AHH!

15:58.958 --> 16:01.992
GET THE CRACKER, STAN.
(makes clicking sound)

16:01.992 --> 16:03.994
LOOK HOW HE GOES
FOR THE BIG ONES.

16:03.994 --> 16:06.266
HE'S NOT A DUCK.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.468
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:08.468 --> 16:11.471
I'M EATING A BIG BITE
OF "I WAS RIGHT" STEAK.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.344
MMM! (smacks lips)
BUT IT NEEDS SOMETHING.

16:14.344 --> 16:18.308
MAYBE A NICE GLASS
OF 1985 "SUCK IT."

16:18.308 --> 16:20.450
(blows air)
AHH. SO SMOOTH.

16:20.450 --> 16:22.452
FINE. HAVING A BABY IS HARDER

16:22.452 --> 16:25.285
WHEN YOU'RE 100 YEARS OLD
LIKE YOU.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.187
THANK YOU.

16:27.187 --> 16:29.189
MMM, MMM. SO GOOD.

16:29.189 --> 16:33.123
WHAT YOU GOT GOING ON THERE,
DIME-EYES?
A BIG BOWL OF "WE CAN DO THIS."

16:33.123 --> 16:37.127
MM-HMM. MMM! COME ON.
IT'S JUST ONE NIGHT.

16:37.127 --> 16:39.499
NO. AND I HATE MIME.
(sighs)

16:39.499 --> 16:41.301
WELL, NOW THAT YOU KNOW
THE CRACKER TRICK,

16:41.301 --> 16:44.374
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING.
FISH CRACKERS
AREN'T THAT POWERFUL.

16:44.374 --> 16:47.207
STAN.
OOH!

16:47.207 --> 16:50.310
PUT YOUR SHIRT ON
FOR A CRACKER.
(cracker thuds)

16:50.310 --> 16:52.142
(babbles)

16:52.142 --> 16:53.443
WECANDO THIS.

16:53.443 --> 16:55.014
YEAH.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.317
YOUR FRIEND'S GOT IT
ALL WRONG, BY THE WAY.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.689
SORRY. I WAS TOTALLY
EAVESDROPPING.

16:59.689 --> 17:02.692
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE MY DAD WAS RIGHT.

17:02.692 --> 17:06.356
I THINK MY DAYS
OF CHEESY CLUBS ARE OVER.

17:06.356 --> 17:09.429
NO MORE TROLLING
FOR ONE NIGHT STRANGE.

17:09.429 --> 17:12.302
I STILL HOOK UP,
AND I NEVER GO OUT ANYMORE.

17:12.302 --> 17:15.065
I JUST GO TO THAT PUB FOR FOOD,
HERE FOR COFFEE,

17:15.065 --> 17:16.336
AND MY PLACE.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.037
HOW ABOUT YOU?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.671
SAME. PUB FOR FOOD,
HERE FOR COFFEE,

17:21.671 --> 17:24.144
AND... YOUR PLACE?

17:24.144 --> 17:25.445
WHO'S YOUR FRIEND?

17:25.445 --> 17:28.548
UH... NO NAMES.
THANKS, DAD.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.749
THANKS, SIR.

17:29.749 --> 17:34.284
OOH, THAT'S MY FRAP-CAP.
PAID $3.75!

17:34.284 --> 17:36.256
(Stan crying in distance)

17:36.256 --> 17:38.488
WHY WON'T HE SLEEP?

17:38.488 --> 17:40.390
CRACKERS AREN'T WORKING.

17:40.390 --> 17:42.792
(crying continues)

17:42.792 --> 17:45.795
ARE YOU TIRED OF FLORIDA?
SHOULD WE LIVE IN LONDON?

17:45.795 --> 17:47.797
WHAT IS A FLAT?

17:47.797 --> 17:49.799
YOU WERE ASLEEP
A TENTH OF A SECOND.

17:49.799 --> 17:52.442
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.

17:52.442 --> 17:55.645
THAT'S IT. I'M GETTING ELLIE.
NO, NO, NO, NO.
COME ON. DON'T GIVE UP.

17:55.645 --> 17:57.477
WE CAN REALLY DO THIS.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.179
THAT IS SO ANNOYING.

17:59.179 --> 18:02.552
WHY DO YOU CARE SO MUCH?

18:02.552 --> 18:04.254
BECAUSE...

18:04.254 --> 18:08.087
(crying stops)

18:08.087 --> 18:09.859
LISTEN.

18:09.859 --> 18:12.222
HE'S OUT.

18:12.222 --> 18:15.195
OH, MY GOD! WE DID IT!
WE DID IT. MMM.

18:15.195 --> 18:17.697
OHH. THE REST
OF THE NIGHT IS OURS.

18:17.697 --> 18:19.199
WHAT TIME IS IT?

18:19.199 --> 18:20.700
IT'S ONLY... 5:00 A.M.

18:20.700 --> 18:24.234
(moans)

18:24.234 --> 18:26.476
(beeping)

18:26.476 --> 18:29.709
(beeping stops)
