WEBVTT

00:00.516 --> 00:03.817
That's classic Nick Miller. Hey look,
I'm holding your hand, and what?

00:04.085 --> 00:05.919
Yeah, I want to go out tonight.

00:05.987 --> 00:07.921
Ugh, couples!

00:07.989 --> 00:10.056
Boo. Hiss.

00:10.124 --> 00:12.492
Every time you have sex
with the same person, Jess,

00:12.559 --> 00:14.960
you die just a little bit.

00:15.028 --> 00:16.429
It's like a copy of a copy.

00:16.497 --> 00:18.664
But lucky us-- we get to go
out looking for some strange.

00:18.732 --> 00:21.133
- Happy V-Day, player!
- Holla!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.568
Look, Jess, truth is, I don't
go out on Valentine's Day.

00:23.637 --> 00:25.470
- What?
- There's no thrill.

00:25.538 --> 00:28.040
You know, all these bars filled
with emotionally vulnerable women.

00:28.108 --> 00:30.475
I'm like a Dominican teenager
playing Little League.

00:30.543 --> 00:32.144
It's just not fair
for everybody else.

00:32.211 --> 00:34.379
It's my first single
Valentine's Day in six years,

00:34.447 --> 00:36.615
and I...
I need to go out, okay?

00:37.682 --> 00:38.950
<i>We</i> need to go out.

00:39.218 --> 00:41.085
'Cause I'm feeling
pretty twirly.

00:41.154 --> 00:43.021
- Twirly?
- Twirly.

00:43.088 --> 00:45.690
- Is that like horny?
- I got the dirty twirls, Schmidtty.

00:46.258 --> 00:50.461
Watch out, 'cause you're
about to get laid... world!

00:58.403 --> 00:59.537
full-on Valentine's.

01:00.304 --> 01:01.405
What'd you do last year?

01:01.473 --> 01:02.972
I was fighting with Caroline.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.206
What were you fighting about?

01:04.275 --> 01:05.642
Oh, you know, the usual--

01:05.709 --> 01:08.144
about how I make too much money
and I dress too fancy

01:08.212 --> 01:09.779
and I'm too good
at communicating my feelings.

01:09.846 --> 01:10.913
- Right.
- Well, this year

01:10.981 --> 01:12.182
we're gonna make up for it.

01:12.249 --> 01:13.650
You and me are gonna do

01:13.717 --> 01:16.286
a real Valentine's Day date.

01:16.353 --> 01:18.487
I know. God,
what's the plan?

01:18.555 --> 01:20.522
Well, first of all, you're
gonna need a map of Arizona.

01:20.590 --> 01:21.756
I can get that.

01:21.824 --> 01:22.824
And a container that you're

01:22.892 --> 01:23.992
comfortable getting urine in.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.495
Oh, I have one in my purse.

01:25.660 --> 01:26.495
You do?

01:26.563 --> 01:28.664
No. Bad idea.

01:28.731 --> 01:30.965
You can't go on a first date
on Valentine's Day, Winston.

01:31.033 --> 01:33.202
Dude, I'm telling you,
it's not a first date, man.

01:33.269 --> 01:35.169
We used to hook up all the time.

01:35.237 --> 01:37.771
You know, for two years I had her
number stored in my phone as "Shretty,"

01:37.839 --> 01:39.273
'cause I was too drunk
to type "Shelby."

01:39.341 --> 01:40.641
She just wanted a
relaxed night in.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.610
It actually sounds
kind of sexy.

01:42.678 --> 01:44.445
Dude, we're just trying to figure
each other out, that's all.

01:44.513 --> 01:46.013
You know where that
puts you in six months?

01:46.081 --> 01:47.548
Yeah, watching
<i>It's Complicated</i> on DVD

01:47.616 --> 01:49.783
while you cradle your
newborn baby to sleep.

01:49.851 --> 01:51.918
And guess what?
It's <i>not</i> complicated.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.286
It's about a bunch
of rich white people

01:53.354 --> 01:54.521
who are remodeling
their kitchen.

01:54.589 --> 01:56.089
Are you sure you're
really ready for that?

01:56.156 --> 01:57.457
Dude, it's gonna be great.

01:57.525 --> 01:59.158
What are you doing?

01:59.227 --> 02:00.460
I'm packing an overnight bag

02:00.528 --> 02:01.828
in case I have
one-night sex.

02:01.895 --> 02:03.930
I've got
a T-shirt, socks...

02:03.997 --> 02:05.064
Is this a sewing kit?

02:05.132 --> 02:06.365
Yes, it's a sewing kit.

02:06.433 --> 02:07.633
Stain remover.

Fixed-gear,
single-speed.

No, I'm not a bike messenger.

02:54.245 --> 02:55.411

- Okay.

I mean, despite
the age difference,

03:02.285 --> 03:04.486
I would just take
that to Pound Town.

03:04.553 --> 03:05.921
You know what I mean?

03:05.989 --> 03:07.990
Just take her a visit
to the boneyard.

03:08.158 --> 03:09.724
You know what I'm saying.

03:10.260 --> 03:11.293

03:29.344 --> 03:30.678

- Ha-ha!

03:32.447 --> 03:34.181
Heart boxers!
These are the best!

03:34.248 --> 03:34.588
Right?

03:34.589 --> 03:35.949
I'm putting them on
right now over my pants.

03:36.017 --> 03:39.085
- You can't stop me.
- I don't want to stop you, because I...

03:39.153 --> 03:40.921
am gonna be rockin'
this action.

03:42.488 --> 03:43.522
You were born
to wear that thing.

03:43.589 --> 03:44.871

any of this, to anybody.

03:44.872 --> 03:45.191
Okay.

03:45.258 --> 03:46.959
- Can we go?
- I have a little bit

03:47.027 --> 03:48.561
more work to do--
just, like, an hour.

03:52.666 --> 03:55.100
- Hey, babe.
- Ooh, you brought wine.

03:55.168 --> 03:56.869
- Yeah.
- Good. We're almost out.

03:56.937 --> 03:57.970

Pick out a polish.

03:59.771 --> 04:01.940
He looks like a player.

04:02.507 --> 04:04.042
Ah. Never mind.

04:04.109 --> 04:06.378
I thought we said no guys.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.147
I am not touching his feet.

04:09.215 --> 04:10.649
- I'm not kidding you.
- That's amazing.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.250
Where's what's his name?

04:12.318 --> 04:14.585
We are actually gonna
meet up later, because...

04:15.453 --> 04:16.553
he's got a little
surprise for me.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.555
Spoiler: it's his penis.

04:18.623 --> 04:20.190
Okay, stop. Enough.

04:20.257 --> 04:20.991
Pay attention.

04:21.059 --> 04:22.493
- You're from Oregon?
- Yeah.

04:22.561 --> 04:24.294
- I'm from Oregon.
- Oh, no. What?

04:24.363 --> 04:26.029
I mean, how often
do you meet Oregonians?

04:26.097 --> 04:27.231
I don't know.

04:27.298 --> 04:28.366
Oh, could you hold on
one second?

04:28.433 --> 04:29.933
- Yeah. Sure.
- Okay.

04:30.001 --> 04:32.969
Oh, my God, he's from
Oregon; I'm from Oregon.

04:33.036 --> 04:34.371
- Bad idea.
- No, you can't do this.

04:34.438 --> 04:35.304
- Horrible.
- I'm sorry.

04:35.373 --> 04:36.473
You bonded emotionally.

04:36.540 --> 04:37.907
If you end up
having sex with him,

04:37.975 --> 04:40.410
it's gonna be missionary
with a lot of eye contact.

04:40.478 --> 04:41.805
Look, that is not
one-night-stand material.

04:41.806 --> 04:42.612
You got to listen to him.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.280

this one. Sorry.

kind of, like, look thing,

06:46.063 --> 06:48.364

makes her confused...

06:48.932 --> 06:50.066
and, then, also kind of hot.

06:51.633 --> 06:52.835
Let me help you.

06:54.304 --> 06:55.938
I'm gonna make her jealous.

06:56.006 --> 06:57.607
All right, can
you... can you stop?

06:57.675 --> 07:00.942
Cece, you are way
too beautiful.

07:01.010 --> 07:02.911
She'll think she doesn't
have a shot with me.

07:02.978 --> 07:04.446
Can you stop looking
at me like that, please?

07:04.514 --> 07:06.448
What look? I'm not
even looking at you.

07:06.516 --> 07:08.684
The pouty one, the
naughty baby Indian.

07:08.751 --> 07:11.152

spicy, and now my lip is swollen. Mm-hmm.

07:40.248 --> 07:41.615
Yeah, yeah, I will.

07:41.682 --> 07:43.116
Okay. Let's go, Kyle.

07:43.183 --> 07:44.484
Schmidtty, Schmidtty, Schmidtty.

07:44.552 --> 07:47.319
Hey, um, so, I'm gonna
go home with Oliver.

07:47.387 --> 07:49.321
Great! I'm so happy...

07:49.389 --> 07:50.856
Hey, three words:

07:51.523 --> 07:52.324
Double bag it.

07:52.392 --> 07:54.360
I got that covered. Um...

07:54.927 --> 07:55.894
These guys...

07:55.962 --> 07:58.230
- hundy bag, so...
- A hundred condoms?

07:58.298 --> 07:59.449
What, are you gonna
have sex with an army?

07:59.450 --> 08:00.599
♪ Oh, I'm gonna ♪

08:00.667 --> 08:02.533
- ♪ Get up in it, mon. ♪
- That's the biggest box of condoms

08:02.601 --> 08:03.701
I've ever seen, honestly.

08:03.769 --> 08:05.069
Does it have, like, a roller?

08:05.137 --> 08:07.071
Like, you know, you go
through the airport with it?

08:07.139 --> 08:08.873
I'm gonna rip him a new one.

08:08.940 --> 08:09.840
<i>Very</i> intimidating.

08:09.908 --> 08:11.276
A normal man

08:11.343 --> 08:13.010
can go maybe three times
in a night,

08:13.078 --> 08:14.412
depending on how
much salmon he's had.

08:14.480 --> 08:17.014
He's literally the most
boring person I've ever met.

08:17.082 --> 08:19.483
He's described every lunch
he's had this week,

08:19.550 --> 08:21.652
and three of them were tacos.

08:21.719 --> 08:23.787
- My work here is done.
- Not really.

08:23.854 --> 08:25.289
Little favor.
He doesn't have

08:25.356 --> 08:27.824
a car, I don't have a car,
'cause I came with you, so I...

08:27.892 --> 08:28.958
No, no, no, no.

08:29.026 --> 08:31.027
No. <i>No.</i>

08:31.095 --> 08:33.530
One of the tacos
had extra cheese,

08:33.597 --> 08:35.998
and the other one had avocados.

08:36.065 --> 08:37.265
<i>And</i> cheese.

08:37.333 --> 08:39.234
<i>And</i> cheese, actually.

08:42.136 --> 08:43.306
Well, I guess

08:43.373 --> 08:44.973
it's time to take
that Chinese head

08:45.041 --> 08:47.075
out of that Chinese ass, Ming.

08:47.143 --> 08:48.644
That's so sweet.

08:48.712 --> 08:50.745
- I love that. Thank you.
- Hey, I pushed

08:50.813 --> 08:52.847
- the reservation to 8:30.
- Okay, I just need

08:52.915 --> 08:54.048
40 to 50 more minutes, okay?

08:54.116 --> 08:55.283
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

08:55.351 --> 08:57.485
Hey, Confucius say:

08:57.553 --> 09:00.254
"You work for me."

09:06.295 --> 09:07.027
What, Winston?

09:07.094 --> 09:08.295
Hey, man, look, I'm sorry

09:08.363 --> 09:09.530
to call you--
I know you're at dinner.

09:09.597 --> 09:10.831
No, I'm not, Winston.
I'm actually

09:10.898 --> 09:12.132
hanging out with
a guy named Cliff.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.167
Are we hanging out?

09:13.700 --> 09:14.767
That's awesome.

09:14.836 --> 09:16.036
Listen here, man,
I'm at Shelby's house.

09:16.037 --> 09:17.337
And there's
two other girls here.

09:17.338 --> 09:18.571
They're drinking
cranberry juice, talking about

09:18.639 --> 09:20.207
Michelle Obama's
upper-body workout.

09:20.274 --> 09:21.842
I got a nose strip
on my face, man.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.075
- So leave.
- It's just that...

09:23.143 --> 09:25.110
I really enjoy
being around this girl.

09:25.178 --> 09:26.679
All right, so stay.

09:26.747 --> 09:28.314
You know what,
I'm gonna stay. I'm gonna...

09:31.818 --> 09:33.418
Can I ask you something?

09:33.486 --> 09:34.354
With her, the...

09:35.121 --> 09:37.022
is it... is it gentle,

09:37.090 --> 09:40.291
or is it...
not so gentle?

09:41.060 --> 09:42.927
You know what I mean?

09:43.495 --> 09:46.351
Yeah, I'm gonna act like you
didn't just say that, Cliff.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.065
Fair enough.

09:47.132 --> 09:48.800
Yeah, Ming, I got your text.

09:48.868 --> 09:50.935
What-what part of that
did you not understand?

09:51.003 --> 09:52.604
Do you want some
champagne, Cliff?

10:02.848 --> 10:04.415
What is that?

10:04.483 --> 10:05.516
Is he injured?

10:06.084 --> 10:06.817
No, I think...

10:07.385 --> 10:08.285
Pause. Pause.

10:08.353 --> 10:10.453
Why are you pausing?

10:10.521 --> 10:12.054
Bathroom break.

10:12.122 --> 10:13.456
It's right in the
middle of the movie.

10:13.524 --> 10:14.657
What are...
What's wrong with him?

10:14.725 --> 10:16.325
Why are you still here?

10:16.394 --> 10:17.460
You don't have a car,
he doesn't

10:17.528 --> 10:18.695
have a car;
How you gonna get home?

10:18.763 --> 10:21.063
I'm gonna take a cab, Schmidt.

10:21.131 --> 10:22.732
It's a horrible
neighborhood, okay?

10:22.800 --> 10:24.634
There are youths everywhere.

10:24.702 --> 10:27.068
Youths? Are you
Officer Krupke?

10:27.136 --> 10:27.870
Would you st...

10:27.937 --> 10:29.805
Damn it.

10:29.873 --> 10:31.774
It's Cece. Hello?

10:31.841 --> 10:34.476
Why are you crashing
Jess's one-night stand?

10:34.544 --> 10:35.811
Well, he asked me if I wanted
to watch <i>Planet of the Apes.</i>

10:35.879 --> 10:38.046
- I didn't know he meant right now.
- Ugh.

10:38.114 --> 10:39.715
- What's wrong with you?
- Hate you. Tell him to leave.

10:39.783 --> 10:41.349
Get out of there, Schmidt.

10:41.418 --> 10:42.950
Leave your car there,

10:43.018 --> 10:44.218
and I'll come get you, okay?

10:44.286 --> 10:45.553
What is going on over there?

10:45.621 --> 10:46.888
Where are you; where's Kyle?

10:46.955 --> 10:48.656
I'm at a playground.

10:48.724 --> 10:49.924
Kyle's shrooming.

10:49.991 --> 10:51.058
Woo-woo.

10:51.126 --> 10:52.293
I'll see you guys later.

10:54.095 --> 10:55.730
I love brown people!

10:55.798 --> 10:57.665
That's racist, Kyle.

10:58.233 --> 10:59.132
Excuse me.

10:59.699 --> 11:00.666
Back to the movie.

11:02.403 --> 11:03.236
Ready?

11:03.304 --> 11:04.704
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:07.374 --> 11:09.242
These monkeys look so real.

11:09.310 --> 11:10.310
Apes.

11:10.377 --> 11:11.277
They're apes.

11:11.345 --> 11:13.379
Oh... you're one of those.

11:13.448 --> 11:14.647
- Get out.
- Like there's a real difference?

11:14.714 --> 11:17.015
- Get out now!
- All right.

11:25.425 --> 11:27.359
Youths!

11:27.427 --> 11:28.661
You know what, Cliff?

11:29.228 --> 11:31.062
I'm sorry,
I'm just feeling very romantic,

11:31.163 --> 11:32.831
and I have nowhere
else to put it,

11:32.898 --> 11:34.432
so happy Valentine's
Day, good looking.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.033
- You know what?
- What?

11:36.101 --> 11:37.335
Put it right here.

11:37.402 --> 11:39.904
'Cause I-I like it.

11:39.972 --> 11:42.106
So how did you get
that far into law school

11:42.174 --> 11:43.407
and then drop out?

11:43.476 --> 11:45.743
Well, I got my heart broken.

11:45.811 --> 11:48.044
- Yeah.
- And then everything got weird.

11:48.112 --> 11:50.567
- I started playing guitar
in an alt-country-ska band.

11:50.568 --> 11:51.181
Sure.

11:51.748 --> 11:52.983
- Gambling a lot.
- Yeah.

11:53.050 --> 11:55.819
There was a really weird week
where I wore a long blonde wig

11:55.887 --> 11:57.754
and I made everybody
call me Sandy Ferguson.

11:57.822 --> 12:00.156
I have never loved
anyone that much.

12:00.224 --> 12:02.425
Then I drove to Mexico, and I
tried to enter a cockfight.

12:02.493 --> 12:03.593
As a person?

12:04.160 --> 12:05.728
Yes, Cliff, as a person.

12:06.596 --> 12:07.596
Come on!

12:07.864 --> 12:08.965
Get me out of here!

12:09.532 --> 12:11.333
Help! Help!

12:11.401 --> 12:14.370
I've had a tough
couple of days, Freddie.

12:14.437 --> 12:16.739
The point of the story is
I looked around at my life

12:16.807 --> 12:19.240
and I realized that I didn't
want to work for somebody else

12:19.808 --> 12:21.075
my whole life.

12:21.143 --> 12:23.077
That is exactly
how I feel, man.

12:23.145 --> 12:25.079
Yeah, but the second
half of that story

12:25.147 --> 12:26.815
is how I went broke
and started working

12:26.883 --> 12:27.849
for somebody else
my whole life.

12:29.218 --> 12:30.451
Okay, what was that?

12:30.520 --> 12:31.586
I don't want to be a lawyer.

12:31.654 --> 12:32.621
I don't want to do this.

12:32.688 --> 12:34.188
Don't do this. Not tonight.

12:34.256 --> 12:36.089
- I'm leaving. I'm leaving tonight.
- Oh, Cliff.

12:36.157 --> 12:38.492
Look what I found
under a pile of depositions.

12:38.560 --> 12:39.459
I'm quitting!

12:40.028 --> 12:40.628
What?

12:40.695 --> 12:41.929
Nick convinced me
that I can't waste

12:41.997 --> 12:43.230
my life doing your
stapling any more.

12:43.297 --> 12:45.232
I never said anything
like that, Julia.

12:45.299 --> 12:47.535
Not doing it any more.
I'm not working

12:47.602 --> 12:48.602
all night on Valentine's Day.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.103
I'm just gonna get in my car,

12:50.171 --> 12:53.105
and I'm just gonna drive
until I see the sun.

12:53.173 --> 12:54.841
'Cause it's got to be
shining somewhere.

12:54.909 --> 12:56.776
And for once in my life,

12:56.844 --> 12:58.545
- I'm gonna spend some time with my birds.
- With you birds?

12:58.612 --> 13:00.013
Woo!
No, Cliff!

13:00.080 --> 13:02.148
We're gonna start
paying you so soon!

13:04.351 --> 13:06.385
Julia, I am so sorry.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.819
I just told him a story

13:07.887 --> 13:09.588
about when I
got arrested in Mexico.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.489
- You got arrested in Mexico?
- I wasn't gonna

13:11.558 --> 13:13.058
tell you until
after you got knocked up

13:13.125 --> 13:14.392
and were stuck with me.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.361
- Now I got to do all this stuff.
- I know.

13:16.429 --> 13:17.295
I'm sorry.

13:17.363 --> 13:18.897
Just go home, Nick.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.866
- Sorry.
- I'll call you tomorrow.

13:22.568 --> 13:23.834
No!

13:26.403 --> 13:27.271
What?

13:27.338 --> 13:28.439
Are you kidding me?

13:28.506 --> 13:30.407
Hey, baby.

13:30.475 --> 13:31.976
Uh, this is my ex, Amy.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.110
We broke up last week.

13:33.178 --> 13:34.545
She can't afford to move out

13:34.613 --> 13:36.047
- 'cause she doesn't work.
- What?

13:37.015 --> 13:38.848
Hey, so how was your night?

13:38.916 --> 13:41.317
Are you serious
right now, Oliver?

13:41.385 --> 13:42.886
- Yeah.
- Um, hey.

13:42.954 --> 13:44.120
I'm Jess.

13:46.055 --> 13:47.056
Hey.

13:47.324 --> 13:48.524
Who is she?

13:49.293 --> 13:50.627
What are you doing here, Cece?

13:50.695 --> 13:52.662
Sorry, I just came
to get Schmidt.

13:52.730 --> 13:54.464
Schmidt left,
like, an hour ago.

13:55.031 --> 13:56.198
No, no, I didn't.

13:56.265 --> 13:57.466
Are you kidding me?

13:57.533 --> 14:00.202
My tires were stolen
by street youths.

14:00.269 --> 14:01.103
Ugh!

14:03.006 --> 14:04.139
Hey, did I pee my pants?

14:04.207 --> 14:05.808
Friends, did I pee in my pants?

14:05.875 --> 14:07.676
- Guys?
- No, Kyle, you're just on drugs.

14:07.744 --> 14:08.877
He definitely peed, I can see.

14:08.945 --> 14:10.712
See! See!

14:10.779 --> 14:12.279
Who's the idiot now?

14:12.347 --> 14:14.115
Okay, all of you,
get out of here.

14:14.182 --> 14:16.150
- I peed my pants.
- We got to get out of... oh.

14:16.218 --> 14:17.251
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

14:17.319 --> 14:18.152
This guy's like a magician.

14:18.920 --> 14:20.254
How does it feel,

14:20.322 --> 14:21.789
Oliver?

14:22.290 --> 14:24.225
Okay, uh, Kyle,

14:24.292 --> 14:26.360
I'm the one you're gonna
sleep with tonight,

14:26.428 --> 14:27.728
so we got to...

14:29.496 --> 14:30.430
What are you gonna do now?

14:33.467 --> 14:34.434
Okay, okay.

14:34.502 --> 14:35.636
Okay.

14:35.703 --> 14:37.270
- My man!
- Get out of my house!

14:40.307 --> 14:41.541
- I will murder you!
- Bye!

14:43.710 --> 14:45.044
- What?
- Hey, Kyle. Hey.

14:45.112 --> 14:46.245
It's a stick.

14:46.312 --> 14:47.412
Go get it.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.614
Ooh, shiny!

14:49.682 --> 14:51.049
Whoo.

14:51.751 --> 14:52.818
What does a girl got to do

14:52.886 --> 14:55.420
to get a one-night stand
around here?

14:55.488 --> 14:58.124
Sorry.

15:00.572 --> 15:02.872
This sangria
is amazing, Winston.

15:03.040 --> 15:04.974
My grandmother's recipe,
so I can't take

15:05.042 --> 15:06.275
credit for that.

15:07.143 --> 15:08.011
But seriously, Tia,

15:08.078 --> 15:10.946
you don't want a man who has
fancier underpants than you.

15:11.014 --> 15:12.648
- I keep trying to tell her that.
- It's true.

15:12.715 --> 15:14.749
You want to have the fanciest
drawers in the relationship.

15:14.817 --> 15:15.417
Boom.

15:15.484 --> 15:16.818
- Wow.
- Hmm.

15:32.833 --> 15:34.834
Hey, are you gonna
be done soon?

15:34.902 --> 15:36.036
Maybe.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.841
She can't keep
eating tacos all night.

15:41.909 --> 15:43.309
Yeah.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.144
Because I ate most
of the tacos yesterday.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.780
You know what?

15:47.847 --> 15:48.681
I can't do this.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.449
You're a really great guy,

15:50.517 --> 15:51.950
and, um, I-I

15:52.018 --> 15:54.153
I mean, I don't know that, um,

15:54.221 --> 15:57.890
but honestly, I was just gonna
use you as a giant meat puppet.

15:58.657 --> 16:00.225
I'm looking pretty good right now.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.260
It's just so hard, you know?

16:02.828 --> 16:05.597
I feel so alone sometimes.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.267
And I lied to you.

16:09.335 --> 16:12.070
I'm not a Web creator.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.905
I'm not a player.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.013
- I miss her so much.
- Oh,

16:23.081 --> 16:24.948
she's in... she's just
in the kitchen.

16:25.016 --> 16:26.283
Baby!

16:26.351 --> 16:27.918
Can you make me a smoothie?

16:33.290 --> 16:34.691
You know, just making copies.

16:34.759 --> 16:36.093
Did you do all of this?

16:36.160 --> 16:37.293
- I did.
- No.

16:37.361 --> 16:38.795
- Yeah.
- Really?

16:38.863 --> 16:41.098
And I just want you to know
that there's a photocopy

16:41.165 --> 16:43.200
of my butt somewhere
in your recycling bin.

16:43.267 --> 16:44.567
Okay.

16:44.635 --> 16:46.802
I had a weird moment,
Julia, and I went for it.

16:46.870 --> 16:48.270
Okay, and if anyone finds it,

16:48.338 --> 16:50.539
I want them to know
that I moved during the copy,

16:50.607 --> 16:52.741
and I don't actually
have two butt cracks.

16:52.808 --> 16:53.842
I know.

16:55.078 --> 16:56.445
What?

16:56.512 --> 16:59.548
I've never ever cared

16:59.616 --> 17:01.183
about Valentine's Day before.

17:01.251 --> 17:03.051
Neither have I.

17:03.119 --> 17:04.318
But it's nice.

17:04.685 --> 17:05.920
- Yeah.
- Right?

17:11.526 --> 17:13.762
You did all the
work wrong, though.

17:14.329 --> 17:15.195
Yeah, I know I did.

17:15.263 --> 17:16.497
That's okay.

17:25.373 --> 17:26.973
I'm sorry.

17:27.040 --> 17:28.708
No, no, no,
do what you got to do.

17:29.777 --> 17:31.111
Hi, Ming.

17:31.679 --> 17:32.979
Yeah, I got your text.

17:33.046 --> 17:34.213
And yeah, it was wrong

17:34.281 --> 17:37.348
just like every single other
text you've sent me tonight.

17:37.416 --> 17:38.549
Call I call you tomorrow?

17:38.617 --> 17:40.519
- Yeah, it's fine, go.
- I'm sorry.

17:41.554 --> 17:42.288
Are you really...

17:42.355 --> 17:43.689
Are you arguing
with me about that?

17:44.457 --> 17:46.425
Are you actually arguing
with me about that?

17:46.493 --> 17:48.560
- Bye.
- Bye, girl, thank you.

17:49.529 --> 17:50.461
Bye.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.562
Bye, Shel.

17:53.832 --> 17:54.766
That was fun.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.534
Any time.

17:57.602 --> 17:58.303
So,

17:58.370 --> 17:59.637
you weren't expecting

17:59.705 --> 18:00.738
a girls' night, were you?

18:01.907 --> 18:02.907
Not really.

18:02.974 --> 18:03.675
You know,

18:03.742 --> 18:04.843
Tia needed some tough love.

18:09.247 --> 18:10.915
You keep doing it.

18:11.682 --> 18:12.516
What?

18:13.283 --> 18:15.585
Making up
for how you used to be.

18:17.588 --> 18:18.655
You don't remember?

18:18.723 --> 18:21.325
Valentine's Day, 2008?

18:21.392 --> 18:23.026
You said you'd call.

18:23.093 --> 18:24.260
You didn't.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.598
Um...

18:30.366 --> 18:32.368
I waited all night.

18:35.105 --> 18:38.506
Okay, I don't deserve
a second chance with you, do I?

18:39.574 --> 18:40.876
But here you are.

18:41.944 --> 18:43.212
Getting one.

18:53.222 --> 18:54.088
- Oh.
- Hey.

18:54.156 --> 18:55.917
Hey, what are you
doing home so soon?

18:55.918 --> 18:56.357
Well,

18:56.424 --> 18:58.726
I helped him get back together
with his ex-girlfriend.

18:58.793 --> 19:00.261
He made me video-chat

19:00.329 --> 19:02.163
with his mom in Hawaii
for a couple minutes,

19:02.231 --> 19:04.565
and then, um,
I came home, so...

19:04.632 --> 19:06.167
Jess, you don't
your first one-night stand

19:06.235 --> 19:07.735
to be with some total stranger.

19:07.802 --> 19:09.370
You got to pick someone
who you know,

19:09.437 --> 19:11.338
who's not gonna make a big deal
out of the whole thing.

19:11.405 --> 19:12.949
- Hmm.
- You have an urge,

19:12.950 --> 19:13.806
you act on it.

19:14.875 --> 19:15.342
And...

19:15.409 --> 19:16.809
whatever you do,

19:16.878 --> 19:19.679
leave immediately afterwards.

19:19.747 --> 19:22.182
God help you if you
get sucked into a brunch.

19:22.250 --> 19:25.051
- Thanks, Schmidt.
- Come here.

19:26.619 --> 19:27.519
You smell good.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.855
It's probably the oil
of the ylang-ylang tree.

19:34.793 --> 19:35.727
Don't over think it.

19:35.795 --> 19:36.929
Okay.

19:46.838 --> 19:48.039
Don't over think it.

19:48.107 --> 19:50.441
Don't over...

19:50.509 --> 19:52.743
Don't over think it.

20:06.124 --> 20:07.357
Schmidt?

20:07.425 --> 20:08.458
Hey, Jess, what are you doing?

20:13.463 --> 20:14.363
I was asking Schmidt a question.

20:14.431 --> 20:15.798
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

20:16.865 --> 20:17.300
Were you...?

20:17.367 --> 20:19.068
- What? No.
- ...with Schmidt?

20:19.136 --> 20:20.736
No! No.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.804
I was holding those,

20:21.871 --> 20:23.906
but I...

20:23.974 --> 20:25.341
Oh, my God.

20:25.409 --> 20:27.209
- What has gotten into you?
- No. No.

20:27.277 --> 20:29.045
- And why do you have so many condoms?
- Shh! Don't ever...

20:29.112 --> 20:30.278
Shh! Don't ever speak
of this again.

20:30.346 --> 20:31.313
You need one.

20:31.380 --> 20:33.114
Tops, two. Let's go.

20:33.182 --> 20:34.950
- We'll get these later.
- I was feeling twirly.

20:35.017 --> 20:36.117
- Nick, Nick...
- No!

20:36.185 --> 20:38.320
You're not having sex
with Schmidt.

20:38.387 --> 20:40.255
This is a danger zone for you.

20:40.823 --> 20:41.923
What is happening out there?

20:42.390 --> 20:43.325
Stop, do not move, okay?

20:43.392 --> 20:44.675
- What? Why...?
- Because if somebody catches us,

20:44.676 --> 20:45.060
I'm gonna say

20:45.127 --> 20:47.194
that you drugged me, and
it's my word against yours.

20:47.262 --> 20:48.262
- Okay?
- Okay, yeah.

20:48.330 --> 20:50.497
That-that's fine,
that makes sense.

20:51.265 --> 20:52.799
You smell so good right now.

20:57.317 --> 20:59.150
You are not gonna believe
the stupid thing

20:59.218 --> 21:00.884
I almost did last night.

21:00.952 --> 21:02.487
Tell me.

21:02.554 --> 21:05.990
Okay, but have to promise
never to tell anyone, ever.

21:06.057 --> 21:07.324
Of course, out with it.

21:07.391 --> 21:09.292
Tell me.

21:09.360 --> 21:11.694
Okay, I almost tried

21:11.762 --> 21:14.364
to hook up with Schmidt

21:14.432 --> 21:15.898
last night.

21:22.405 --> 21:24.040
That would have been crazy.

21:24.608 --> 21:25.908
I know!

21:25.976 --> 21:27.977
Can you imagine? Ugh.

21:28.545 --> 21:29.812
I cannot.

21:30.813 --> 21:31.812
I got to go, okay?

21:32.513 --> 21:33.512
Bye.
