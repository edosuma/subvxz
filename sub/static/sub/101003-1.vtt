and final judge of the destination
for your eternal soul. Dazzle me!

01:48.733 --> 01:52.487
I did sweaty, filthy things
to a sad, old man.

01:52.570 --> 01:56.491
I stole a tombstone from the cemetery
and blamed it on my brother.

01:56.574 --> 02:00.078
I put goofballs in my mom's coffee
so I could have a kegger.

02:00.161 --> 02:05.250
You know what? You know what?
Nana got me a goldfish, and I ate it.

02:05.333 --> 02:08.253
I'm harboring resentful thoughts
about my husband.

02:08.336 --> 02:12.132
Marie is mad at me because I took
some innocent crotch-level pictures

02:12.215 --> 02:13.341
of our neighbor.

02:13.424 --> 02:15.844
I crashed a school bus
into a telephone pole

02:15.927 --> 02:17.220
and blamed it on my son.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.889
I received the sacrament of oral sex,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.350
but I passed out
before I could reciprocate.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.728
And then I found the goldfish
in the toilet later.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.857
But it wasn't gold,
and it wasn't swimming.

02:28.940 --> 02:31.568
I knew Chet was being poisoned,
but I didn't say anything.

02:31.651 --> 02:36.156
I held back five dollars from my pimp
that wasn't mine to keep.

02:36.239 --> 02:37.532
I'm a watcher, not a doer!

02:37.615 --> 02:39.993
Daddy loves me so much.

02:40.076 --> 02:45.373
My son is really my nephew,
and my dead sister was a whore!

02:46.332 --> 02:49.544
There ain't no toilet paper
in this here talking bathroom.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.754
Okay, it's six o'clock. Bye-bye, now.

02:54.632 --> 02:57.635

at the end of your shift.

[door opens, closes]

03:00.305 --> 03:01.306
Anybody in here?

03:01.389 --> 03:04.225
Sir, I'm afraid confession time
is over for this week.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.311
Oh, come on, pick up.
I got to talk to you.

03:06.394 --> 03:07.562
It's me, Frank Murphy.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.940
I walked in on you sitting on the shitter
at the couples' retreat.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.152
I remember. You know,
this is supposed to be anonymous.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.363
Come on, Father, I'm at the end
of my rope here. You got to hear me out.

03:17.822 --> 03:21.117
You know, Frank, I'd be more inclined
to bend the rules

03:21.201 --> 03:22.452
if you ever came to Mass.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.830
Okay, I'm sorry
about my lack of attendance,

03:26.414 --> 03:29.042
but coming to Mass blows
my whole Sunday right out of the water.

03:29.125 --> 03:33.046
I got to get up early, shave,
pile the family in the car.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.591
Then once I get here, I'm kneeling,
I'm standing, I'm kneeling, I'm sitting,

03:36.674 --> 03:38.843
shaking hands
with people I don't care about.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.347
And even then it's not over because I have
to take the whole family out for waffles!

03:42.430 --> 03:45.099
Everybody gets waffles!
And there's another line.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.559
We can make waffles at home,

03:46.643 --> 03:50.521
but no, we have to go out
where the whole town's getting waffles!

03:50.605 --> 03:52.815
I got my wife a waffle iron
for our anniversary.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.569
She said, "What's this for?"
I said, "So I can have my Sundays back!"

03:56.653 --> 03:59.072
So, yeah, I don't go to church, okay?

03:59.155 --> 04:01.574
Because I figure I'm not gonna make it
to heaven anyways.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.576
None of my dreams
have come true in this world.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.620
Why should the afterlife be any different?

04:05.703 --> 04:07.538
But I've had a really bad run lately.

04:07.622 --> 04:09.040
Today was my worst day in months.

04:09.123 --> 04:12.085
My wife and kids think I'm crazy,
and I don't know what to do with myself.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.213
So you are gonna sit there,
listen to what I have to say,

04:15.296 --> 04:17.674
clean it up a little bit,
break the news to him,

04:17.757 --> 04:20.009
and tell him to get off his fat cloud
and give this guy a win!

04:20.093 --> 04:20.927
[knocking]

04:21.010 --> 04:23.513
[woman whispers] Sir, I'm sorry,
but we can hear you out here.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.350
And God can see you
interrupting me, so go fuck yourself!

04:35.650 --> 04:40.154
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
I... just told a nun to go fuck herself.

He's been out of my life for years.
No contact.

06:03.071 --> 06:06.699
And then he just comes waltzing back in

06:06.783 --> 06:09.702
Well, it may comfort you to know
that you're not alone.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.996
I had a difficult stepfather.

06:12.080 --> 06:15.750
Did he make you wear a grass skirt because
you cried when Pearl Harbor happened?

06:15.833 --> 06:19.295
Oh, no. My... my goodness. A grass skirt?

06:19.379 --> 06:21.756

06:21.839 --> 06:25.301

06:27.011 --> 06:29.305
Okay. [inhales]

06:29.389 --> 06:33.684
When I was a kid, my dad was
the most popular guy in Rustvale.

06:33.768 --> 06:35.812
<i>"Big Bill Murphy" they called him.</i>

06:37.021 --> 06:39.941
<i>And he was like a king</i>
<i>in his hardware store on Main Street.</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:46.072
So Dick Sawitzki says to me, "Big Bill,"
he says, "You've got the gift of gab.

So then Jack O'Connor says to me,

07:09.846 --> 07:13.808
"Big Bill, you could sell snowballs
to an Eskimo."

07:13.891 --> 07:16.269
Why would you sell snowballs to an Eskimo?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.437
You wouldn't.

07:17.520 --> 07:22.233
Then why would Jack say that?
Doesn't he know how cold it is up there?

07:22.316 --> 07:27.905
For the love of God, Nora, he's just
trying to say that I'm a good salesman.

07:27.989 --> 07:31.826
Eskimos don't even buy anything.
They have a barter economy.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.079

in a play or something.

11:39.281 --> 11:40.491
I'd love that.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.330
So here you are. Just like that.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.584
Well, come on out, you big bully.
I'm not afraid of you, tough guy.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.547
Come on, face your son... Dad.

11:59.468 --> 12:00.970
Good to see you, son.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.139
What?

12:03.222 --> 12:05.850
No, it's been too long.
Thanks for welcoming me.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.518
Did you have a stroke?

12:07.601 --> 12:09.645
-Mr. Murphy, I'm--
-No! No, no, no.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.690
No Mr. Murphy.
"Mr. Murphy" was my father.

12:12.773 --> 12:14.817
That rotten apple's been feeding the worms

12:14.900 --> 12:17.111
since Frank here
was knee-high to a sailor,

12:17.194 --> 12:20.197
which he was several times
during the war years.

12:20.281 --> 12:22.908
It's how we paid for the coal. [laughs]

12:22.992 --> 12:26.162
No, I'm just kidding.
Frank never blew a sailor.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.663
[chuckles]

12:27.747 --> 12:29.582
You must be the lovely Susan.

12:29.665 --> 12:33.169
And aren't you just as radiant
as the summer sun?

12:33.252 --> 12:35.421
Frank, he's charming.

12:35.504 --> 12:37.757
He just said I spent my childhood
blowing sailors.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.592
He said you didn't!

12:39.675 --> 12:41.427
-Hi, I'm Bill!
-I'm Maureen!

12:41.510 --> 12:44.847
Frank, I'm honored.
You named your son "Bill" after me.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.641
Don't get excited.
It was Sue's turn to pick.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.393
Hey, Grandpa, I'm Kevin Murphy.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.730
Look at you.
A dead ringer for your father.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.023
[both] Aw, shit.

12:54.106 --> 12:56.484
Kevin, have a giant typewriter key.

12:56.567 --> 12:58.277
It's a "Q" for "cool"!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.529
A giant typewriter key?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.491
He got a big job as a regional salesman

13:03.574 --> 13:06.619
for Dustbowl Typewriter Ribbon
and Adding Machine Tape.

13:06.702 --> 13:08.871
They sent him here
to scope out the territory.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.831
The bastard bounced all the way back!

13:10.915 --> 13:14.794
Why don't you come inside?
I'm sure it was a long trip from Tulsa.

13:14.877 --> 13:19.548
Oh, it was an ordeal. They lost my bag.
My meal tasted like an ashtray.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.635
No matter what you do, kids,
never fly Mohican.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.887
It's run by circus pinheads.

13:24.970 --> 13:28.808
Ugh. He acted nice,
like a Nazi living in Brazil.

13:28.891 --> 13:30.059
And he kept it up!

13:30.142 --> 13:31.852
<i>Helping me build the baby's room.</i>

13:32.561 --> 13:33.771
<i>Doing the dishes.</i>

13:34.271 --> 13:36.273
<i>Remembering Bill's birthday.</i>

13:36.357 --> 13:38.234
<i>Telling Kevin he has a future.</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:41.779
All aboard the Grandpa Express!

13:41.862 --> 13:44.615
[children] Chug-a-chug-a-chug-a-chug-a.

13:44.698 --> 13:45.699
Toot-toot!

13:45.783 --> 13:51.413
Now passing Sourpuss Junction!
Population: one grumpster!

13:51.497 --> 13:52.748
[children laugh]

13:52.832 --> 13:54.583
[Frank] <i>Even the neighbors</i>
<i>fell for his bullshit!</i>

13:54.667 --> 13:57.962
Okay, Big Bill will have these T-bones
out for you in no time.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.964
[scoffs] T-bones.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.175
And I know how you take them, Babe,
well-done!

14:03.259 --> 14:06.011
And, Goomer, extra rare.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.681
I like it cold on the inside.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.808
Your dad's a hell of a guy, Frank.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.685
Eh, not bad for a fucking Mick.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.437
He said my head was normal-sized.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.940
He's so sweet with Anthony.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.484
Oh, tummy yum-yum!

14:20.568 --> 14:22.778
Oh, he had everyone fooled.

14:22.862 --> 14:26.782
But I knew... it was just a matter of time
before he showed his true colors,

14:26.866 --> 14:29.243
and they'd all see what a prick he was.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.412
-And did he?
-No, he did not.

14:31.495 --> 14:33.163
And that was four weeks ago.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.499
<i>But the shit he pulled on me today,</i>

14:35.583 --> 14:37.585
<i>-that's why I had to come here. He told--</i>
-[knock on door]

14:37.668 --> 14:40.462
[Sister Layla] Father Patrick,
you need to come right away.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.423
It's time for Mr. McCriskin's funeral.

14:42.506 --> 14:45.301
You made up a great one,
but I'm gonna finish the confession.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.510
It's getting juicy.

14:46.594 --> 14:50.222
No, Father, there's a real dead guy
and everything!

14:50.306 --> 14:53.267
[organ music playing]

14:55.311 --> 14:58.397
Mr. McCriskin can wait in purgatory
for a few more minutes.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.857
Just keep them entertained.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.111
Hey, how's everybody doing today?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.529
[audience clamoring]

15:05.613 --> 15:06.614
So, what happened then?

15:06.697 --> 15:10.075
Everything. On Friday night,
I got devastating news.

15:10.576 --> 15:13.329
<i>What's that, Colt?</i>
<i>You say you got out of the submarine,</i>

15:13.412 --> 15:15.331
<i>but now you're about to go in a coma?</i>

15:15.414 --> 15:17.333
<i>Oh, come by when you get better.</i>

15:17.416 --> 15:20.294
Aw, what the fuck? Where is Colt?

15:20.377 --> 15:23.505
I think he's gonna be in a coma
for a while, Dad.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.468
Ah, fuck me!

15:29.803 --> 15:32.389
[Frank] <i>And then I got worse news.</i>

15:32.473 --> 15:33.807
The old man's never gonna leave.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.018
He's selling a boatload
of typewriter ribbon,

15:36.101 --> 15:38.145
so they want him to open a new territory.

15:38.228 --> 15:41.649
-He's gonna stay at least another month.
-Oh, the kids will love that.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.610
The kids also love
the smell of gasoline, Susan!

15:44.693 --> 15:48.155
I'll tell you, I can't take him anymore.
I have enough to deal with right now.

15:48.238 --> 15:52.576
I'm working three jobs since Pogo had
his heart attack, the pork-eating fuck!

15:53.077 --> 15:56.664
And now we're all going downtown
with Big Bill so he can get himself a car,

15:56.747 --> 16:00.250
and then he's taking the whole family
to lunch, which, of course, I'll pay for.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.087
-If he says he wants to pay, Frank, then--
-No, I'm paying.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.005
I'll show him how well I'm doing.

16:05.089 --> 16:08.425
I might have to break into the swear jar.
There's got to be a couple grand in there.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.094
We used it all for Kevin's bail money.

16:10.177 --> 16:12.596
Aw, piece-of-shit
motherfucking cocksucker!

16:12.680 --> 16:13.555
Frank, stop it!

16:13.639 --> 16:16.433
Ah, start a new jar.
I don't give a shit-shit-shit-shit!

16:16.517 --> 16:17.977
[yells] Frank, calm down!

16:18.602 --> 16:20.688
[sighs] Come here, honey.

16:24.149 --> 16:28.112
-I understand that he was a bad father.
-The worst.

16:28.195 --> 16:30.906
Okay, the worst. But--

16:30.990 --> 16:33.492
Why is there always a "but"
at the end of you agreeing with me?

16:33.575 --> 16:38.038
But... he's been very nice,
especially to the kids.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.373
I'm nice to the kids.

16:40.791 --> 16:45.087
Yes, you are.
But maybe he's really changed.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.547
People do change.

16:46.630 --> 16:49.216
I don't. You don't.
You keep getting pregnant.

16:49.299 --> 16:51.218
-Ow.
-You listen to me.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.637
I know you have your problems with him,

16:53.721 --> 16:56.765
but the kids are enjoying
their time with their grandfather.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.642
And he's not gonna be here forever.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.770
Would it kill you
to hold out a little longer?

17:01.854 --> 17:03.022
Fine. You're right.

17:03.647 --> 17:05.983
I mean, if I can shove
a man's intestines back into his body,

17:06.066 --> 17:08.902
Lord knows I can put up with this asshole
for another couple of weeks.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.446
You can do it, honey.

17:11.947 --> 17:13.907
But you're really gonna need
to work on your--

17:13.991 --> 17:17.703
Oh, would you stop with the "buts"?
It's a fucking sickness with you.

17:19.997 --> 17:22.791
You ready to go downtown?

17:22.875 --> 17:25.669
Oh, yeah, it's a big day for Big Willie.

17:25.753 --> 17:28.964
Home office sent me a little cash
to get some wheels.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.592
Wow. I've never seen
those presidents before.

17:31.675 --> 17:35.596
Then it's time for the vagabond to find
a more permanent place to stay.

17:35.679 --> 17:39.683
I'm, uh... going to get myself
a nice quiet motel room somewhere.

17:39.767 --> 17:43.979
I recommend
the Quint City Motor Inn on Route 16.

17:44.063 --> 17:48.400
I visited it once or twice
with a woman I was seeing.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.986
Oh, really? And who was that?

17:51.070 --> 17:54.990
I don't want to say her name.
She might appear.

17:55.074 --> 17:59.244
It's a shame you got to go, Big Bill.
Families should all be together.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.664
Sometimes a little break
is just what the doctor ordered.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.668
I told you, I'm done with
all that Vic stuff, my Swedish meatball!

18:07.336 --> 18:09.922
Now that's a man who loves his woman.

18:10.005 --> 18:12.341
-See? Vic said--
-Don't you talk to me!

18:13.008 --> 18:15.511
Nope, a motel it is.

18:16.011 --> 18:21.183
Frank, I have taken advantage
of your generous hospitality far too long.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.310
[clears throat]

18:24.686 --> 18:27.272
I'm sure Sue would love
to have her couch back.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.399
My couch.

18:33.779 --> 18:37.324
Wait a minute. Goomer has his trailer.

18:37.407 --> 18:38.951
You can stay in there.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.036
Goomie, you never use it.

18:42.913 --> 18:47.960
That's right. I don't use it for anything.
[chuckles nervously]

18:49.086 --> 18:51.755
Just give me a little time
to clear some stuff out.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.424
And bleach the walls.
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

18:54.508 --> 18:58.512
-[door creaks open]
-Oh, you've got some great neighbors, son.

18:58.595 --> 19:00.180
Nobody look at it!

19:00.264 --> 19:02.724
Let's get you that car, Mr. Wonderful.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.977
Daddy, are we getting a new car too?

19:05.060 --> 19:07.896
No, princess. Our car is just fine.

19:09.356 --> 19:12.484
The back door popped open
when you took me to the movies yesterday.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.443
I almost fell out.

19:13.527 --> 19:16.864
Aw, will you stop whining
about shit that almost happened?

19:16.947 --> 19:19.449
I almost walked out on your mother
last week. I'm still here.

19:20.033 --> 19:23.453
You listen to your dad, son.
He knows what's best.

19:23.537 --> 19:27.875
He would never put saving a buck
before your safety.

19:27.958 --> 19:31.003
If he's okay with you
rolling out into traffic,

19:31.086 --> 19:34.339
then who am I to say
he's not a good father?

19:34.423 --> 19:39.094
If he says the car is fine, it's fine.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.554
That son of a bitch.

19:43.515 --> 19:45.434
Here's the rest of the down payment.

19:45.517 --> 19:49.605
You can keep the green stamps.
Pleasure doing business with you both.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.649
Whoa, the tailgate opens two ways!

19:52.733 --> 19:54.610
This must be what astronauts drive!

19:54.693 --> 19:58.572
Frank, you don't have to do this
to impress your father.

19:58.655 --> 20:00.657
Are you sure we can even handle it?

20:00.741 --> 20:04.161
Yes, Susan. I'm extremely well-paid.

20:04.661 --> 20:07.789
We're doing 150 payments, right?
With the $20 trade-in?

20:07.873 --> 20:11.210
Yeah. You pay me $20
to take that heap off your hands.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.420
You're a thief. Let's eat!

20:16.882 --> 20:20.761
Well, that's the last time I do
a personal appearance for these hicks.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.889
The Polack that runs that TV store
said he'd watch out

20:23.972 --> 20:26.725
for the water-headed psycho.
That kid keeps sending me hair.

20:26.808 --> 20:30.020
Jim, you brought this on yourself
for rigging that game.

20:30.103 --> 20:34.399
And you've got to get your... problem
with pregnant women under control.

20:35.067 --> 20:37.569
I'm working on it, Ray, but it's tough.

20:37.653 --> 20:41.073
Especially this weekend. Labor Day.

20:41.573 --> 20:44.785
Grandpa, will you take me to the first day
of school Wednesday in your new car?

20:44.868 --> 20:48.830
I would be as happy
as a hand in a doorknob factory.

20:48.914 --> 20:51.708
My car is newer.
I signed the papers second.

20:51.792 --> 20:54.711
I think you'll be proud
of your grandchildren when school starts.

20:54.795 --> 20:58.882
They've all promised to work very hard
on their studies this year. Right, Kevin?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.926
[making kissing noises]

21:01.009 --> 21:02.052
[chuckles]

21:02.135 --> 21:04.763
Oh, hi, ketchup, you want to fuck?

21:05.472 --> 21:09.601
And Frank and I have made a promise to be
more attentive and involved this year.

21:09.685 --> 21:13.272
A hundred and fifty payments,
$34 a payment,

21:13.355 --> 21:16.483
it'll be paid off in '86. Christ,
there'll be a black president by then.

21:16.984 --> 21:18.944
Grandpa, will you come
and watch me play hockey?

21:19.027 --> 21:21.613
Jesus Christ, Bill!
The fuck is wrong with you?

21:21.697 --> 21:25.242
Okay, calm down, son.
It's not the end of the world.

21:26.451 --> 21:27.452
What did you say to me?

21:27.869 --> 21:30.747
Well, there's no need to lose your cool
over a little spill.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.875
You've got to be shitting me.
You goddamn hypocrite!

21:33.959 --> 21:35.544
Whoa, whoa, okay, take it easy.

21:35.627 --> 21:37.713
Oh, I've been taking it easy for a month.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.798
Hey, kids, you want to know
what your grandpa did

21:39.881 --> 21:41.925
when I spilled a bit of grape juice?

21:42.009 --> 21:43.927
-He shoved ice cream in my face!
-[chuckles]

21:44.011 --> 21:45.554
I never did any such thing.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.222
-Yes, you did!
-Never!

21:47.306 --> 21:49.057
And you called me a "goddamn dope."

21:49.141 --> 21:51.018
You called me a "dope"
when I failed Algebra.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.520
-Oh, I did not!
-[children] Yes, you did.

21:53.603 --> 21:54.855
Silence!

21:56.023 --> 21:58.900
-What about the grass skirt, Dad?
-Oh, it was a joke.

21:58.984 --> 22:00.027
Sounds funny to me.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.321
It wasn't funny. It hurt my feelings!

22:02.404 --> 22:03.739
That's what's funny about it.

22:03.822 --> 22:07.326
A grass skirt and coconuts he got me
for crying over an act of war!

22:07.409 --> 22:08.785
Who does that to a kid?

22:08.869 --> 22:10.495
Well, you said you'd buy me a doll

22:10.579 --> 22:14.333
if I didn't stop talking about the guy
whose guts landed on me at the airport.

22:14.416 --> 22:17.711
-You got to stop living in the past, Bill!
-Frank, you promised!

22:17.794 --> 22:20.964
At least one guy's got bigger problems
than I do and--

22:21.048 --> 22:25.260
Sweet Jesus, that balloon's about to pop,
and I want to be under it!

22:25.344 --> 22:26.428
Tell them, Dad!

22:27.346 --> 22:29.139
Tell them some of the shit
you used to do to me!

22:30.682 --> 22:32.184
-Tell them!
-Dad, leave him alone.

22:32.267 --> 22:33.685
Spit it out, you son of a bitch!

22:33.769 --> 22:36.897
Stop yelling at the choo-choo man!

22:47.032 --> 22:48.075
[sighs]

22:48.867 --> 22:50.369
The hell with this.

22:50.452 --> 22:53.288
Enjoy the rest of your day
with Santa Claus.

23:18.313 --> 23:19.898
[Frank] <i>And that's when I came in here.</i>

23:20.732 --> 23:23.860
If he'd just once admit to me
what a prick he was,

23:23.944 --> 23:25.028
just once...

23:25.987 --> 23:27.406
I could find some peace.

23:27.989 --> 23:29.825
Nah, but he'll-- he'll never do that.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.830
Oh, Frank, I'm so sorry for your pain.

23:35.330 --> 23:38.542
But our Father brought
your father back into your life,

23:38.625 --> 23:40.460
and now you have a choice.

23:40.544 --> 23:45.090
You can let out all your anger at him
and call him an old so-and-so

23:45.173 --> 23:46.883
and live with that hatred forever,

23:46.967 --> 23:49.845
or you can choose to accept his presence

23:49.928 --> 23:53.765
the way I think our Lord wants you to.
With forgiveness.

23:53.849 --> 23:57.894
Forgive the bastard for what he did to me?
What the hell kind of bullshit is that?

23:57.978 --> 24:00.689
Your job is to mumble some prayers
and tell me I'm going to heaven.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.357
Confession doesn't work that way.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.609
-Then what am I paying you for?
-You don't pay me.

24:04.693 --> 24:08.196
I put coins in those stupid
cardboard boxes every Halloween!

24:08.280 --> 24:09.322
That's UNICEF.

24:09.406 --> 24:12.159
Aw, shit, what a waste this was.

24:12.242 --> 24:14.953
Forgive my dad? I'll never forgive him!

24:15.036 --> 24:16.371
[door opens, slams shut]

24:17.330 --> 24:20.083
-Talk to God! He loves you!
-[door opens]

24:20.167 --> 24:23.086
-That's a company lie, and you know it!
-[door slams shut]

24:48.028 --> 24:50.197
-[laughing]
-[Big Bill Let me tell you...

24:52.657 --> 24:53.992
[indistinct chatter]

24:56.828 --> 24:58.788
[garage door creaking]

25:09.925 --> 25:12.344
Goddamn son of a bitch. [grunts]

25:12.427 --> 25:14.346
Coming here, making my kids happy.

25:14.429 --> 25:17.432
"Oh, talk to God." Oh, what a laugh!

25:17.516 --> 25:20.352
Just sits there with his son
and the fucking Holy Ghost,

25:20.435 --> 25:22.521
thinking he's better than me. [grunts]

25:22.604 --> 25:24.272
It's Frank Murphy calling!

25:24.356 --> 25:27.734
Why'd you bring that fucker back to me?
I demand an answer!

25:33.823 --> 25:35.867
Aw, fuck all three of you!
