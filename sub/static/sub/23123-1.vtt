BOY MISSING

02:33.959 --> 02:35.126
Where is he?

02:35.292 --> 02:37.834
He was found on the road
during school hours.

02:38.001 --> 02:40.667
He's very scared, he doesn't want
to talk or communicate with anybody.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.417
Any calls asking for him?

02:42.584 --> 02:44.001
He's still unidentified.

02:44.667 --> 02:48.584
No fractures or internal injuries
and we've ruled out abuse.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.334
But he's still unresponsive.

02:50.501 --> 02:52.917
Whatever happened
has left him in shock.

02:58.251 --> 02:59.501
Hi kid.

02:59.667 --> 03:03.667
I'm Ernesto Requena. This ugly guy
here is my colleague Carreño.

03:12.334 --> 03:13.417
What's your name?

03:16.001 --> 03:17.209
What happened?

03:23.084 --> 03:27.001
It's okay, just tell me how
to take you home. Where do you live?

03:28.459 --> 03:30.126
We'd like to help you, okay?

03:34.292 --> 03:36.917
- Is that the uniform he was wearing?
- Yes.

03:37.084 --> 03:40.126
We're checking it
against the schools in the area.

03:46.292 --> 03:48.667
His name is Victor de Lucas,
he's in Year 6,

03:48.834 --> 03:51.292
but he's been sick for several days
and he hasn't come today.

03:51.459 --> 03:54.292
- Was he wearing the uniform?
- I don't know.

03:54.459 --> 03:58.126
He hasn't attended classes today.
I don't know what else to say.

03:58.292 --> 04:00.626
We have to find his parents.

04:06.834 --> 04:09.417
The criminal court
number 2 that I chair

04:09.584 --> 04:11.917
declares Mr. Ignacio Puerta Gil

04:12.792 --> 04:16.750
absolved of the crime
of embezzlement of public funds

04:16.916 --> 04:20.916
and money laundering
for lack of evidence.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.417
- Happy?
- Very.

04:38.584 --> 04:41.834
It's all over now.
See you in a minute, okay?

04:42.001 --> 04:42.667
Okay.

04:50.417 --> 04:52.292
Mrs. de Lucas!
Does he have to testify again?

04:52.459 --> 04:54.584
Are you afraid
that the prosecution appeals?

04:54.751 --> 04:57.626
The prosecution and his Honour
have worked most effectively,

04:57.792 --> 05:00.126
so it makes no sense to appeal.

05:00.292 --> 05:04.876
It's impossible to find new evidence
because they don't exist.

05:05.042 --> 05:07.834
Reality imposes to prove

05:08.001 --> 05:10.667
that my client
has been wrongly accused.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.042
Thank you all very much.

05:25.751 --> 05:29.459
- Great job.
- I gave you my word.

05:30.001 --> 05:33.209
- What now?
- The second part of the deal.

05:37.501 --> 05:39.626
- Totally guaranteed?
- Absolutely.

05:47.459 --> 05:51.292
Congratulations. You were
the opener of all news bulletins.

05:51.459 --> 05:54.417
- Any news?
- Emergency meeting at 5.

05:54.584 --> 05:56.959
Move it to 3:30.
Then I'm going home.

05:57.126 --> 05:58.834
- Is Victor still sick?
- No. He went to school today.

05:59.001 --> 06:02.209
And I promised him we'd finish
his spaceship this afternoon.

06:02.376 --> 06:03.959
- Anything else?
- No.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.334
- I'll see you later in the office.
- Very well.

06:55.876 --> 06:56.917
507, please.

07:28.584 --> 07:31.042
Hello? Yes, it's me.

07:33.501 --> 07:36.251
Yes, I'm his mother,
is everything okay?

07:39.834 --> 07:42.501
What was my son doing
on the street if I left him at school?

07:42.667 --> 07:44.376
At the building's door
or at the entrance's gate?

07:44.542 --> 07:47.251
- At the gate, like everyone else.
- Did you see him getting inside?

07:47.417 --> 07:51.292
No. I always wait until he crosses it
and I see him walking to the building.

07:51.459 --> 07:54.459
But today I had to get
to the court early.

07:54.626 --> 07:58.292
- Does your son like going to school?
- He doesn't have those problems.

07:58.459 --> 08:00.542
Would you rule out
that he ran away to skip class?

08:00.709 --> 08:01.751
Absolutely.

08:01.917 --> 08:04.126
What about at home? Have you argued?
Have you grounded him? Or...

08:04.292 --> 08:06.792
My son hasn't escaped,
something happened to him.

08:06.959 --> 08:08.959
I'd also like to talk with his father.

08:09.126 --> 08:11.751
- There's no father.
- Oh! I'm sorry. Did he die?

08:11.917 --> 08:14.709
That's irrelevant.
Victor only has me.

08:16.959 --> 08:20.542
Now he's asleep, but he didn't react
to anything, not a word.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.959
Victor doesn't speak.
Well, he knows how to speak but...

08:24.126 --> 08:27.292
he feels shy. He doesn't control
his voice volume quite well.

08:27.459 --> 08:29.376
He was born deaf.

08:31.251 --> 08:34.667
- Haven't you seen his hearing aids?
- He wasn't wearing them.

08:47.709 --> 08:49.334
Hello, my love...

09:00.626 --> 09:01.959
What happened?

09:05.417 --> 09:07.709
Who has done this to you?

09:09.709 --> 09:13.626
I want to go home.

09:14.376 --> 09:18.084
First tell me why
you weren't at school

09:18.251 --> 09:21.376
and then we'll go home.

09:23.042 --> 09:27.751
- I cannot tell you.
- You can always tell me everything.

09:30.584 --> 09:31.959
My love,

09:32.876 --> 09:34.084
Victor...

09:41.417 --> 09:44.292
<i>Patricia de Lucas, the prestigious
lawyer who successfully</i>

09:44.459 --> 09:46.334
<i>settled her last case this morning,
is going through a difficult time</i>

09:46.501 --> 09:50.126
<i>after the disappearance of her son
at the school's gate.</i>

09:50.292 --> 09:52.084
<i>The little boy is in the hospital...</i>

09:52.251 --> 09:55.459
- I don't know how they've found out.
- I've called them.

09:56.334 --> 10:00.084
I will not let my son's
disappearance go unnoticed.

10:08.459 --> 10:13.251
Anything to say?

11:34.959 --> 11:37.376
- How is he?
- He's okay, Alba. Don't worry.

11:37.542 --> 11:40.209
And now with this,
he'll be even better, thanks.

11:46.751 --> 11:47.542
Here.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.167
Put them on.

11:59.834 --> 12:00.917
Better?

12:04.209 --> 12:05.126
Let's go.

12:11.667 --> 12:14.876
Victor, breathe with me.

12:19.917 --> 12:23.084
Very good. You're very brave.

12:24.167 --> 12:28.584
We'll talk to the police
and then we'll go home,

12:29.959 --> 12:31.292
I promise.

12:37.751 --> 12:40.542
So, you didn't get inside the building?

12:42.251 --> 12:43.167
Why?

12:45.001 --> 12:46.334
Why not?

12:51.042 --> 12:53.209
- What did he say?
- Tell him.

12:56.167 --> 12:58.417
No, he says he couldn't get inside.

12:58.792 --> 13:01.959
Why, son?
Why couldn't you get inside?

13:04.167 --> 13:05.709
Did you feel sick?

13:07.209 --> 13:08.792
You didn't want to go to class?

13:09.626 --> 13:12.459
If you didn't want to go,
it's fine. Okay?

13:14.084 --> 13:15.751
I won't get angry.

13:16.501 --> 13:18.084
Was that the reason?

13:19.542 --> 13:22.084
Then, why didn't you go to class?

13:22.917 --> 13:26.459
- Someone didn't allow you?
- Someone didn't allow to get inside?

13:31.959 --> 13:34.417
Who?

13:35.167 --> 13:36.001
Who?

13:46.376 --> 13:49.792
A man.
A man approached him at the entrance.

14:01.542 --> 14:03.292
How was he dressed?

14:06.542 --> 14:09.292
He dressed like the school gardeners.

14:09.584 --> 14:10.584
What else?

14:13.334 --> 14:17.001
He says that everything happened
so fast and then he fainted.

14:18.959 --> 14:19.959
Did he hit you?

14:31.876 --> 14:33.501
That's why you fainted?

14:35.084 --> 14:37.042
Did he approach you facing you?

14:37.959 --> 14:39.876
So, you could see his face.

14:40.042 --> 14:43.292
Not that sign.
So, did you see his face?

14:44.876 --> 14:46.209
Did you know him?

14:47.584 --> 14:49.667
What else did he do to you, honey?

14:49.834 --> 14:51.834
Please hold on a minute, ma'am.

14:52.001 --> 14:53.209
How was the man?

14:55.209 --> 14:57.417
He says he was an ordinary man.

14:57.584 --> 15:01.126
Was he old like me?
Tall? Short? Fat? Lean?

15:02.834 --> 15:04.126
He saw him briefly.

15:05.167 --> 15:05.876
And then what?

15:09.417 --> 15:13.417
He says he woke up
in a dark place and everything moved.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.834
And didn't you hear anything
that could help us?

15:16.001 --> 15:20.001
- Traffic? A train?
- He wasn't wearing his hearing aids.

15:20.167 --> 15:22.292
Oh, right.
Did he took them off?

15:25.501 --> 15:29.667
He says he must have lost them
when he fainted. He doesn't remember.

15:29.834 --> 15:32.917
Don't worry, kid, you're doing great.

15:33.084 --> 15:34.917
Just tell me what you remember.

15:53.584 --> 15:56.584
Do you remember how the house
looked from outside?

15:56.751 --> 15:59.126
He says there was a forest
and he saw the house,

15:59.292 --> 16:02.626
but just briefly,
he doesn't remember it.

16:03.126 --> 16:04.501
How did you get out?

16:05.792 --> 16:07.042
Did you escape?

16:23.459 --> 16:26.376
Many of these cases are solved
without our intervention

16:26.542 --> 16:28.209
because families pay.

16:28.376 --> 16:30.792
They don't demand a very high amount

16:30.959 --> 16:33.584
and parents prefer
not to take any risk.

16:34.042 --> 16:36.292
Your son is a perfect target.

16:37.626 --> 16:38.501
This one?

16:42.459 --> 16:46.042
Have you noticed any movement out
of the ordinary in your neighbourhood?

16:46.209 --> 16:48.626
- Or in your workplace?
- You mean if someone followed me?

16:48.792 --> 16:49.917
No, I'd have done something.

16:50.084 --> 16:53.626
Has anyone unexpected
or unknown tried to contact you?

16:53.792 --> 16:55.709
I don't have any call
like that in my cell.

16:55.876 --> 16:57.626
Maybe your son tried to call you.

16:57.792 --> 16:59.876
That would give us some clues
about the location.

17:00.042 --> 17:01.792
Can we check your calls?

17:01.959 --> 17:03.876
Why aren't we informed about all this?

17:04.041 --> 17:08.084
We don't take on most of the cases.
We cannot report what we don't know.

17:08.251 --> 17:10.459
And is it better not doing anything
and waiting for it to happen?

17:10.626 --> 17:12.834
Chief, we have a suspect.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.459
This is the photofit.

17:25.041 --> 17:27.626
And we have a profile
that is a 90% match.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.167
Is it him?

17:34.334 --> 17:37.126
Is it him who tried to kidnap you?

17:40.834 --> 17:43.334
His name is Carlos Coronas,
aka Charlie.

17:43.501 --> 17:46.584
He's charged for theft, assault
and breaking and entering.

17:47.126 --> 17:50.501
He served time in prison, was released
3 years ago and since then, nothing.

17:50.667 --> 17:54.292
But he has motives for wanting money:
his flat will be repossessed.

18:25.584 --> 18:27.042
What happened to you?

18:29.001 --> 18:30.792
Are you going to tell me?

18:32.709 --> 18:36.167
Nothing. I went to a job interview

18:37.042 --> 18:39.292
and it sucked, as always.

18:40.792 --> 18:42.626
I don't know
what the hell people want.

18:42.792 --> 18:45.292
Do they want me to kneel down
and kiss their shoes?

18:45.459 --> 18:47.042
Something will come up, you'll see.

18:48.876 --> 18:50.501
I just want to work.

18:52.001 --> 18:53.667
Was it at the bar?

18:58.001 --> 18:59.126
Where then?

19:04.001 --> 19:05.292
With whom?

19:07.626 --> 19:08.709
Charlie.

19:08.876 --> 19:11.834
I just hit a wall, honey, that's it.

19:20.626 --> 19:23.459
- Is this Carlos Coronas' home?
- Yes.

19:24.667 --> 19:25.667
Charlie.

19:26.792 --> 19:30.584
- Are you Carlos Coronas?
- What's going on?

19:30.751 --> 19:33.251
- Come to the police station with us.
- Why?

19:33.417 --> 19:35.001
We'll tell you there.

19:35.542 --> 19:39.001
- Can I have a word with my wife?
- No, no, no, no. Come with us.

19:45.334 --> 19:47.876
- What are you doing?
- Just wanted a kiss, damn it!

19:55.459 --> 19:56.876
Come with us, please.

20:05.876 --> 20:07.417
The kid made a mistake.

20:07.584 --> 20:10.042
- What have you done this morning?
- I was with my wife.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.376
Where? What have you done?

20:11.542 --> 20:13.876
We stayed at home.
We went for a walk. The usual.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.626
How did you hurt your hand?

20:17.542 --> 20:20.667
Fixing some things.
With a rusted piping.

20:20.834 --> 20:22.417
Am I arrested or not?

20:22.584 --> 20:26.042
You're in my custody...
until you convince me.

20:28.209 --> 20:31.542
- What have you told your wife before?
- That's personal.

20:32.084 --> 20:33.959
You're not going to convince me
with that, you know?

20:34.167 --> 20:37.251
A friend of mine is a lawyer.
I told her to call him.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.709
I have nothing to do
with that kid! Nothing!

20:39.876 --> 20:42.792
- So, you don't know what he said?
- With the fuss, I didn't understand.

20:43.917 --> 20:47.626
Where was Charlie
between eight and one o'clock?

20:47.792 --> 20:49.834
- He was with me.
- Doing what?

20:50.459 --> 20:54.209
I got home after my night shift.
I'm a shelf stacker.

20:54.376 --> 20:58.084
Charlie was sleeping. Then we had
breakfast and we stayed there.

20:58.251 --> 21:01.292
- All day?
- Well, we went for a walk.

21:03.376 --> 21:05.251
And how did he hurt his hand?

21:07.251 --> 21:08.876
You weren't with him, were you?

21:09.042 --> 21:13.709
I was. But I was in the shower.
He was fixing something.

21:18.834 --> 21:20.417
What do you think he's done?

21:23.001 --> 21:25.334
Charlie told me
he spent some time in prison,

21:25.501 --> 21:27.792
but now he's with me.
We're good people.

21:30.626 --> 21:32.667
Please, tell me what's going on.

21:44.542 --> 21:47.709
They didn't want me to come down.
They just gave me two minutes.

21:47.876 --> 21:50.334
Have you told them
we were together? Good.

21:54.584 --> 21:57.876
- The kid says it was you.
- I didn't do anything to him!

21:58.042 --> 22:00.459
You've done something. Tell me.

22:01.751 --> 22:04.251
- Did you go to the job interviews?
- No, I didn't, they don't want me,

22:04.417 --> 22:06.792
they wouldn't hire me
for any job, Raquel.

22:06.959 --> 22:08.167
And what have you done?

22:10.209 --> 22:11.667
I need a lawyer.

22:27.876 --> 22:29.417
He hasn't even tasted it.

22:32.126 --> 22:33.959
It's not your fault, dear.

23:06.292 --> 23:08.209
It's looking perfect.

23:09.792 --> 23:11.167
Does it have a name?

23:12.542 --> 23:17.126
- Pegasus.
- Pegasus.

23:18.667 --> 23:21.542
And where do you want to go
with spaceship Pegasus?

23:24.917 --> 23:26.042
To the moon?

23:26.709 --> 23:28.501
Forever.

23:29.876 --> 23:32.542
Forever?

23:32.709 --> 23:35.167
And won't you miss me?

23:35.334 --> 23:37.292
You'll come with me.

23:38.834 --> 23:42.792
My love, I cannot go to the moon.

23:44.167 --> 23:47.292
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

23:48.709 --> 23:50.209
I'm tired.

23:51.792 --> 23:54.417
Well, you'll stay home tomorrow.

23:55.501 --> 23:57.542
But just tomorrow, alright?

24:03.667 --> 24:04.834
Look at me.

24:06.959 --> 24:08.917
Victor, look at me.

24:09.626 --> 24:12.042
You're safe now,

24:14.376 --> 24:15.917
I promise.

24:21.626 --> 24:22.334
Wait.

24:27.001 --> 24:27.917
Hello?

24:28.084 --> 24:31.792
<i>Hi, I'm Daniel's mother,
from your son's school.</i>

24:31.959 --> 24:35.334
We barely know each other,
but he kept insisting.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.376
How is... Victor?

24:39.459 --> 24:42.459
Well, it's difficult to say.

24:42.626 --> 24:47.959
<i>Listen, Daniel would like
to cheer him up in behalf of ail.</i>

24:48.126 --> 24:51.376
- Could he come and visit him?
- Wait a minute, please.

24:52.459 --> 24:56.459
It's Daniel.
He wants to come and cheer you up.

25:27.667 --> 25:28.917
-Inspector.
- Headmistress.

25:29.584 --> 25:31.292
We're going to enclose
the school's perimeter.

25:49.709 --> 25:52.334
Inspector Requena.
I think we've found something.

26:07.042 --> 26:07.834
Anything?

26:08.376 --> 26:09.334
Negative.

26:09.501 --> 26:12.876
But we're taking all
we can to analyse it. And you?

26:13.042 --> 26:16.751
<i>Just the hearing aids. Nobody
remembers having seen the suspect.</i>

26:16.917 --> 26:18.084
The lawyer is here.

26:19.834 --> 26:21.459
The pettifogger is here.

26:22.542 --> 26:25.292
My client keeps arrested
without any conclusive evidence,

26:25.459 --> 26:28.501
you've invaded his home
and confiscated all you pleased.

26:28.667 --> 26:30.667
I demand an inventory
of everything you've taken

26:30.834 --> 26:32.626
and a compensation for this poor lady

26:32.792 --> 26:35.792
who's 8 months pregnant
and couldn't sleep in her home.

26:35.959 --> 26:39.084
And of course, I demand
the immediate release of my client

26:39.251 --> 26:41.126
or I'm going to bring
a big fucking lawsuit

26:41.292 --> 26:44.376
against your police station
for rights infringement.

26:49.251 --> 26:52.084
<i>Carlos Coronas, the alleged
kidnapper of Patricia de Lucas's son</i>

26:52.251 --> 26:54.917
<i>has been released this afternoon
for lack of evidence.</i>

26:55.084 --> 26:57.167
<i>Although the suspect
has a criminal record,</i>

26:57.334 --> 27:00.251
<i>police couldn't confirm
the tittle boy's testimony.</i>

27:00.417 --> 27:01.584
<i>Mr. Coronas, Mr. Coronas.</i>

27:01.751 --> 27:06.501
<i>Leave him alone.
He has nothing to say.</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:09.251
<i>My wife is pregnant, damn it!</i>

27:09.417 --> 27:12.584
<i>Do you have to testify again?
Anything to say?</i>

27:16.751 --> 27:18.542
They searched through all places.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.584
Charlie.

27:21.459 --> 27:25.126
If you're in trouble, let us help you.

27:29.917 --> 27:31.126
Hold on a second.

27:34.251 --> 27:34.959
Tell me.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.792
I've seen you
in the fucking news bulletin.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.417
All is sorted out!

27:41.626 --> 27:42.584
<i>Not everything.</i>

27:42.959 --> 27:45.334
- It is, really.
- No, sort it out.

27:45.501 --> 27:49.459
- How? I have nothing to do with it.
- Sort it out or I will.

28:09.042 --> 28:10.126
Charlie!

28:13.917 --> 28:14.959
Charlie!

28:15.834 --> 28:16.709
Charlie!

28:23.251 --> 28:27.167
- What do you want us to buy?
- A game and a ball.

28:27.334 --> 28:29.334
- Very well.
- And a dog.

28:29.501 --> 28:30.834
A dog, I'm not so sure.

28:39.459 --> 28:42.376
Are you happy
about not going to school?

28:44.667 --> 28:48.251
Are we going shopping again tomorrow?

28:49.376 --> 28:53.209
No, no, not tomorrow,
I have to work.

30:00.209 --> 30:03.709
You're screwed and if you keep
messing around, you'll be more.

30:03.876 --> 30:06.584
I just wanted to approach the kid
so he'd tell the truth.

30:06.751 --> 30:08.292
I haven't seen him in my life.

30:08.459 --> 30:11.251
It's his fault I'm here,
I already have problems, damn it!

30:11.417 --> 30:14.876
Say you didn't follow him,
that you know nothing. Deny it all.

30:21.001 --> 30:23.917
How was I supposed to follow
the kid if I was at home?

30:25.126 --> 30:26.376
Are there any witnesses?

30:27.459 --> 30:30.042
I was alone. But it's the truth.

30:34.126 --> 30:37.042
You're going to become
a father soon, right, Charlie?

30:37.209 --> 30:38.751
And have you thought
about what would happen

30:38.917 --> 30:41.709
if you couldn't see your child
because you're in prison?

30:41.876 --> 30:43.667
It'd be a shame, wouldn't it?

30:47.084 --> 30:48.792
My son is in danger.

30:50.251 --> 30:54.334
- You cannot release him again.
- Nor detain him without evidence.

30:54.501 --> 30:58.126
He's lying and everybody
in this police station knows it!

30:58.292 --> 31:00.001
Does anybody want
to do their job well?

31:00.167 --> 31:02.251
We all want to do our job well,

31:02.417 --> 31:04.542
including the lawyer
who's told the suspect

31:04.709 --> 31:06.376
to lie to us in our fucking face,

31:06.542 --> 31:09.917
because that's doing
a good job for you, right?

31:11.042 --> 31:13.376
We'll assign protection to your son.

31:13.834 --> 31:17.292
You'll have a bodyguard from home
to school until this gets solved.

31:26.251 --> 31:29.876
Here. This will help you rest.

31:35.084 --> 31:38.709
That man won't be able
to approach you.

31:38.876 --> 31:40.959
Mum sorted everything out.

31:41.792 --> 31:46.751
A police car will be watching
and I'll take you to the door.

31:47.126 --> 31:49.376
Any teacher will leave you alone.

31:50.251 --> 31:52.626
I'm scared at home.

31:53.292 --> 31:56.542
No, my love.
You're safe here too.

31:57.584 --> 31:59.626
Mum will leave the alarm on.

32:00.626 --> 32:01.459
Look.

32:03.042 --> 32:04.751
If you wake up,

32:06.417 --> 32:11.459
you switch it off with this button.
With this one, you switch it on. Look.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.292
Leave it there.

32:20.126 --> 32:24.209
I don't want to go to school tomorrow.

32:25.376 --> 32:28.501
Well, we'll talk tomorrow.

32:29.876 --> 32:30.709
Give me a kiss.

32:32.709 --> 32:33.584
Come on.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.083
What's wrong? What's wrong?

35:51.459 --> 35:53.417
Where have you been all night?

35:58.417 --> 36:02.292
I don't know what you do,
where you go, you tell me nothing.

36:04.209 --> 36:06.459
Don't worry, everything is alright.

36:06.626 --> 36:08.626
There are 20.000 Euros.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.959
How did you get them?

36:15.501 --> 36:17.334
I'm fed up with this, Charlie.

36:20.876 --> 36:24.459
They're for you and the baby girl,
so they don't take away our flat.

36:26.042 --> 36:28.209
- What have you done?
- I don't want to get you involved.

36:28.376 --> 36:29.834
I'm already involved.

36:33.042 --> 36:36.292
If you don't tell me what's going on,
you can leave now.

36:44.167 --> 36:49.042
I'm interested in the Russian, okay?
Alright, boys?

36:54.334 --> 36:55.542
Well, off to work.

37:03.292 --> 37:06.751
- What are you doing here?
- I need your help.

37:08.876 --> 37:11.459
- Is she your daughter?
- Her name is Laia.

37:12.001 --> 37:14.542
I thought your wife
didn't want children.

37:14.709 --> 37:17.417
And I thought you didn't want
to know anything about me.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.709
Why have you come, Patricia?

37:36.459 --> 37:38.334
You don't know anything
about what happened to me?

37:38.501 --> 37:40.542
On the newspapers or on TV?

37:40.709 --> 37:42.792
I don't watch TV nor read newspapers.

37:43.126 --> 37:46.126
I need to give
a wake-up call to someone.

37:48.167 --> 37:50.959
You come here
after 10 years to ask me to...?

37:51.126 --> 37:54.376
Don't be shocked,
it wouldn't be the first time for you.

37:54.542 --> 37:56.834
There are other laws
at the port, you said.

37:57.001 --> 38:00.709
I told you I'd change and I did.

38:02.376 --> 38:05.709
- People don't change.
- I was going to leave Sandra for you.

38:05.876 --> 38:08.626
But you disappeared
without giving any explanation.

38:08.792 --> 38:11.084
Come on, Raul, I need it.

38:11.917 --> 38:15.001
If you don't want to do it,
I'm sure you know someone who can.

38:15.417 --> 38:18.167
<i>- I'll</i> pay well.
- Money isn't everything.

38:19.584 --> 38:23.667
Come on,
don't look as if I offended you.

38:27.917 --> 38:29.584
I've investigated you.

38:30.542 --> 38:33.584
I know you owe a lot of money
to the union people.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.876
I'll get it without your help.

38:38.042 --> 38:39.876
You'd need a miracle

38:40.959 --> 38:43.709
and I'm bringing you one,
make the most out of it.

38:44.209 --> 38:48.376
I just want to put the guy who tried
to kidnap Victor in his place.

38:48.542 --> 38:51.376
He's still free
and the police looks the other way.

38:51.542 --> 38:52.667
Who is Victor?

38:53.751 --> 38:54.709
My son.

38:59.626 --> 39:00.667
Your son.

39:21.209 --> 39:23.209
Why didn't you tell me?

39:25.376 --> 39:27.084
Nothing would have changed.

39:27.876 --> 39:31.542
You had to get on with your life
and I got in your way.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.626
This world is not for me.

39:40.459 --> 39:43.001
But now I feel hemmed.

39:44.084 --> 39:46.834
And I don't expect anything else
from you, don't worry.

39:51.834 --> 39:55.167
Why did you have him?
Why having the kid was okay?

40:02.876 --> 40:04.209
Because I loved you.

40:10.792 --> 40:12.209
Do you have a picture?

40:30.917 --> 40:32.417
What have you told him?

40:36.417 --> 40:37.459
Nothing.

40:47.042 --> 40:48.709
I don't trust the police.

40:50.292 --> 40:52.001
All I ask

40:52.167 --> 40:55.959
is that the bastard who kidnapped
my son never gets closer again.

40:56.584 --> 40:58.251
I just want you to scare him.

41:12.709 --> 41:14.126
Thank you very much.

41:23.376 --> 41:25.459
Where was Charlie the other night?

41:26.459 --> 41:27.626
With me.

41:29.084 --> 41:30.542
And yesterday afternoon?

41:31.917 --> 41:33.209
With me as well.

41:34.209 --> 41:36.167
You started work at 6.

41:36.334 --> 41:39.126
Yes, but he was with me anyway.

41:39.501 --> 41:41.584
Looking how you shelf stock, right?

41:46.917 --> 41:50.042
Do you know he was
at the police station with us?

41:51.417 --> 41:52.876
Hasn't he told you?

41:55.959 --> 41:59.001
The kid's mother says
he followed them to their club.

41:59.167 --> 42:02.251
At night someone got into their house
and approached his son.

42:04.709 --> 42:06.917
What else hasn't he told you?

42:07.084 --> 42:10.251
That he hasn't attended
a job interview in months?

42:11.209 --> 42:14.959
Perjury is punished
up to two years of prison.

42:15.792 --> 42:18.334
We can help you, but of course,

42:18.501 --> 42:20.876
you have to give us
something in return.

42:24.876 --> 42:27.834
On the morning of the kidnapping,
Charlie wasn't home.

42:28.001 --> 42:28.834
Right.

42:29.959 --> 42:32.251
But he says he hasn't done
anything to the kid,

42:32.417 --> 42:35.209
he was betting on something
and he couldn't tell.

42:36.417 --> 42:37.792
Dog fights.

42:40.001 --> 42:42.792
Apparently you can make
a lot of money,

42:42.959 --> 42:44.959
but people who manage them
are dangerous and if police

42:45.126 --> 42:47.459
knew where they are,
they would hurt Charlie.

42:47.626 --> 42:50.126
- Has he told where they take place?
- He's scared.

42:50.876 --> 42:53.167
He says the kid has put him in danger.

43:03.459 --> 43:05.292
Thank you for coming so soon.

43:05.459 --> 43:07.459
I know this isn't easy for your son.

43:07.626 --> 43:10.792
- I don't understand why we're here.
- We have to reconsider everything.

43:10.959 --> 43:12.042
Why?

43:12.209 --> 43:15.251
Charlie lied and his wife
has covered him up

43:15.417 --> 43:17.417
but not for the reason we thought.

43:17.959 --> 43:21.501
At the time of the kidnapping,
Charlie was in a dog fight.

43:21.667 --> 43:25.042
- In a dog fight?
- We've been going after them.

43:25.209 --> 43:27.167
We've located them
in the southern area.

43:27.334 --> 43:29.376
And checking the traffic cameras,

43:31.626 --> 43:32.917
we've found this.

43:33.834 --> 43:37.709
This picture was taken at 9:03
on the morning of the kidnapping.

43:37.876 --> 43:39.834
Charlie couldn't kidnap your son

43:40.001 --> 43:42.292
and drive around this area
at the same time.

43:42.459 --> 43:45.626
But Victor identified him,
it must be a mistake.

43:46.042 --> 43:47.584
Your son's mistake.

43:49.751 --> 43:51.501
We have to start again.

43:57.959 --> 44:00.084
Honey, come in.

44:05.501 --> 44:07.917
We just want you
to take a look at these pictures

44:08.417 --> 44:11.959
and tell us if you recognise
the man who kidnapped you.

44:12.959 --> 44:15.417
The man who tried to kidnap you.

44:19.542 --> 44:20.834
Is he here?

44:26.667 --> 44:28.709
As long as it takes, my love.

44:28.876 --> 44:30.501
Let's move to the next one.

44:36.917 --> 44:38.001
Who? This one?

44:40.042 --> 44:42.542
This one? Number two.

44:46.834 --> 44:48.001
Julian Oltra.

44:53.834 --> 44:55.667
Are you sure it's him?

44:56.542 --> 44:57.751
Are you sure?

44:57.917 --> 45:00.667
No, no. Look at me. Is it him?

45:05.792 --> 45:08.251
This man was in prison
until a month ago.

45:08.417 --> 45:09.751
So, he's free now?

45:09.917 --> 45:13.584
He committed suicide in his cell.
He was buried three weeks ago.

45:22.501 --> 45:24.334
What's going on here, kid?

45:27.167 --> 45:29.417
What are you not telling us?

45:32.167 --> 45:33.209
Victor...

45:40.209 --> 45:41.001
What?

45:41.167 --> 45:42.376
What did he say?

45:44.876 --> 45:47.501
- We have to tell him.
- Tell me what?

45:49.334 --> 45:52.459
No one tried to kidnap him.
He made it all up.

46:00.667 --> 46:04.792
- Are you okay?
- I need to go to the toilet.

46:32.501 --> 46:34.584
<i>Raul Losada. Leave your message.</i>

46:36.334 --> 46:40.667
It's me.
Stop everything, change of plans.

46:57.042 --> 46:58.876
Why did you make it up?

47:04.917 --> 47:06.417
We'll wait outside.

47:17.334 --> 47:18.917
Tell me the truth.

48:11.667 --> 48:12.376
Come on.

48:13.459 --> 48:15.459
- Hey!
- No, Charlie, you can't get in.

48:15.626 --> 48:17.917
- Fucking hell, man!
- The boss says you can't get in.

48:18.084 --> 48:19.334
- Sorry.
- Listen, man. Listen to me.

48:19.501 --> 48:22.876
- I need money for my family.
- Come in, come in.

49:08.376 --> 49:10.084
5.000 for the pit bull.

49:16.792 --> 49:19.376
This is the last time I see you here.

49:19.542 --> 49:21.334
I'm tired of seeing you on TV.

49:21.501 --> 49:23.459
I swear I don't have anything
to do with the fucking kid.

49:23.626 --> 49:26.792
I don't care.
One round and get out.

49:27.834 --> 49:28.959
And don't come back.

50:12.167 --> 50:13.709
Pull! Pull!

50:31.001 --> 50:33.834
Fuck you! Fuck you!

51:20.001 --> 51:22.209
Listen to me, you're a motherfucker!

51:22.792 --> 51:26.126
You've made me lose 5.000 Euros
with the fucking pit bull!

51:54.709 --> 51:56.251
What is this about?

51:58.084 --> 52:00.292
Ask the lawyer.

52:14.459 --> 52:16.126
Son of a bitch!

52:30.792 --> 52:32.417
Are you angry?

52:33.042 --> 52:36.834
I'm not angry with you.

52:37.626 --> 52:40.167
But if you had told me before...

52:41.292 --> 52:45.334
I don't want to talk
with the policeman.

52:45.917 --> 52:47.542
He scares me.

52:47.709 --> 52:51.292
Don't worry. I'll talk to them.

53:03.334 --> 53:04.126
Hello?

53:05.834 --> 53:06.751
<i>What's going on?</i>

53:08.292 --> 53:11.251
I cannot talk to you right now, but...

53:11.417 --> 53:13.709
- Is it sorted out?
- They're working on it.

53:14.334 --> 53:17.459
My client doesn't want
to carry on because...

53:18.126 --> 53:20.917
It was a mistake,
he didn't do anything.

53:21.626 --> 53:23.376
Did you get the wrong target?

53:23.542 --> 53:25.917
<i>Exactly. So...</i>

53:26.084 --> 53:27.417
there's no deal.

53:28.001 --> 53:31.167
<i>Damn it, Patricia.
I'm calling them right</i> away.

53:31.334 --> 53:33.334
Very well. Thank you very much.

53:36.667 --> 53:38.667
He's told me that...

53:39.584 --> 53:44.084
some kids have been hitting him
and insulting him for months.

53:44.834 --> 53:47.501
They've even been filming him
to humiliate him.

53:49.209 --> 53:51.751
Before escaping,
he pretended he was sick

53:51.917 --> 53:54.626
for an entire week
in order not to go to class.

53:55.417 --> 54:00.292
That morning, he also tried
to stay home but I didn't let him.

54:08.459 --> 54:12.334
I was unable to notice that my son
was trying to protect himself.

54:14.792 --> 54:17.834
Look at him. Look who's here.

54:18.001 --> 54:19.876
Dumbo. Did you miss us?

54:20.751 --> 54:23.542
Did you miss us?
Your hearing aids don't work or what?

54:23.792 --> 54:26.084
Right, come on.

54:26.251 --> 54:27.292
Fly Dumbo, fly.

54:27.751 --> 54:31.209
Come on Dumbo, come on.

54:32.001 --> 54:33.542
Come on Dumbo, come on.

54:35.376 --> 54:37.501
Come on Dumbo, fly.

54:44.917 --> 54:46.501
Don't resist yourself!

54:50.917 --> 54:52.501
Come on. Eat it.

54:52.667 --> 54:55.751
I said eat it!
Don't resist yourself, it's yummy.

54:56.126 --> 54:58.667
Come on. Come on.
Don't resist yourself.

55:00.626 --> 55:03.001
You like it, right? You like it!

55:05.792 --> 55:08.501
He wanted to go back to school
at the end of the day.

55:09.251 --> 55:10.876
He thought that having been ill,

55:11.042 --> 55:13.834
if no one saw him getting inside,
nobody would miss him.

55:14.001 --> 55:16.292
But he got disoriented.

55:18.042 --> 55:20.584
And unintentionally,
he got away from school.

55:21.751 --> 55:24.167
When he realised what he had caused...

55:25.126 --> 55:29.501
He got scared and didn't have
the courage to tell the truth.

55:36.209 --> 55:39.001
Victor is a very observant kid.

55:40.667 --> 55:42.917
That's why he gave us
such a precise description.

55:43.084 --> 55:44.709
He felt hemmed

55:45.542 --> 55:48.751
and then those kids
started to pressure him.

55:49.376 --> 55:53.292
They feared what would happen
to them if Victor told the truth.

55:53.792 --> 55:57.084
They said to him that if he talked,

55:57.917 --> 56:01.751
they'd go after him
and this time it wouldn't be a game.

56:03.042 --> 56:04.584
They would kill him.

56:36.334 --> 56:37.084
Hello?

56:41.042 --> 56:41.876
Hello?

56:43.042 --> 56:47.251
<i>Raul has given us your number.
Your request got complicated.</i>

56:48.751 --> 56:49.917
Who are you?

56:50.084 --> 56:52.959
<i>You know Raul and we know him.</i>

56:53.126 --> 56:56.751
<i>Besides,</i> we <i>know how you look,
we've</i> seen <i>you on the</i> news.

56:58.209 --> 56:59.876
Raul had to call you to tell you...

57:00.042 --> 57:02.334
We were already up shit creek
without a paddle.

57:02.501 --> 57:03.917
<i>What's going on?</i>

57:05.751 --> 57:07.042
The target croaked.

57:09.709 --> 57:12.417
<i>We had to give him
a wake-up call as Raul asked.</i>

57:12.584 --> 57:15.542
He also told us it'd be an easy job
but he lied to us.

57:17.251 --> 57:18.584
Son of a bitch!

57:28.251 --> 57:30.167
Fucking hell!

57:32.501 --> 57:33.751
We have a fucking corpse.

57:33.917 --> 57:36.251
If you don't collaborate,
when the police finds it,

57:36.417 --> 57:38.709
it'll have your name tattooed
on the ass. You understand me now?

57:38.876 --> 57:41.542
That wasn't the deal.
Raul told me...

57:41.709 --> 57:44.167
Forget about Raul!
He has nothing to do with it now.

57:44.334 --> 57:47.376
We'll take care of the corpse,
but you have to pay us.

57:48.751 --> 57:50.251
No,I can't.

57:50.542 --> 57:53.001
You and your son
have involved us in this bloody mess!

57:53.167 --> 57:55.001
Don't you dare
getting my son involved in this.

57:55.167 --> 57:57.584
My friend and I
want six million to disappear.

57:57.751 --> 57:59.834
What has happened is your business.

58:23.334 --> 58:24.292
Work.

58:26.792 --> 58:30.459
I just wanted them to give him
a wake-up call, not to end his life.

58:30.626 --> 58:33.751
Why did you tell them
who they were working for?

58:33.917 --> 58:36.167
How were they supposed
to pass the message then?

58:36.334 --> 58:38.876
But you should have prevented them
to get to me. You should...

58:39.042 --> 58:40.167
What?

58:40.334 --> 58:42.542
I asked your help
so you'd be my intermediary.

58:42.709 --> 58:45.084
And now two stupid friends of yours
who haven't done their job well

58:45.251 --> 58:46.667
are going to blackmail me.

58:46.834 --> 58:49.876
They aren't my friends, just two guys
who owed me some favours.

58:50.042 --> 58:52.792
Now they don't answer before anyone.
Now it's your business.

58:55.709 --> 58:58.459
- Do it for Victor.
- I need to think about my family.

58:58.626 --> 59:00.959
Don't destroy my life again.

59:03.584 --> 59:05.042
You're involved in this
as much as I am.

59:07.001 --> 59:09.417
I don't want to see you
again in my fucking life.

59:12.917 --> 59:16.251
Leave me out
of all your shit, understood?

59:27.126 --> 59:29.959
- B roads, Alba.
- Yes.

59:30.126 --> 59:31.751
- No tolls.
- Yes.

59:31.917 --> 59:33.542
- You've filled the tank up? Give me.
- Yes.

59:39.959 --> 59:41.042
Thanks Alba.

59:42.667 --> 59:43.584
Go.

59:48.834 --> 59:50.542
See you in a few days.

59:51.876 --> 59:53.626
Are you going
to be okay all by yourself?

59:55.709 --> 59:59.959
Yes, but I'm going to miss you.

01:00:01.751 --> 01:00:03.167
I love you so much.

01:00:17.292 --> 01:00:20.084
- There are more, do you want to see?
- There's no need.

01:00:21.251 --> 01:00:25.501
The same old thing, but now there are
mobiles, cameras, social networks.

01:00:25.667 --> 01:00:27.251
Let's see what the Minors Brigade
can wheedle out of them.

01:00:27.417 --> 01:00:30.126
Daniel is going to be a big fucker
if he doesn't learn his lesson.

01:00:30.459 --> 01:00:32.126
Well, case closed.

01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:35.417
Get the paperwork ready
for the Minors Prosecuting Office.

01:00:35.584 --> 01:00:38.001
Inspector, Carlos Coronas' wife...

01:00:43.209 --> 01:00:45.751
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Yesterday night.

01:00:45.917 --> 01:00:47.542
He took the car
but he didn't tell me where.

01:00:47.709 --> 01:00:51.251
- He doesn't pick up the phone?
- No. I've called the hospitals.

01:00:51.417 --> 01:00:54.251
Then I thought he'd be arrested again.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:55.626
Because of the kid.

01:00:57.959 --> 01:01:01.167
Your husband never wanted
to hurt Victor de Lucas.

01:01:02.501 --> 01:01:04.542
Charlie isn't a bad person.

01:01:04.834 --> 01:01:06.251
What if he's hiding?

01:01:06.417 --> 01:01:09.126
If he knows we're following
a lead on the illegal bets...

01:01:09.292 --> 01:01:10.959
No, I didn't tell him we talked.

01:01:12.334 --> 01:01:14.001
Charlie does what he can.

01:01:15.751 --> 01:01:17.542
Are you going to help me?

01:01:29.917 --> 01:01:31.751
Charlie's mobile is disconnected,

01:01:31.917 --> 01:01:35.459
but we've triangulated the signal and
the last time active was around here.

01:01:35.626 --> 01:01:38.376
- It coincides with the betting.
- And that's his car.

01:01:38.542 --> 01:01:41.209
- And the motorbikes?
- We're working on it.

01:01:42.001 --> 01:01:43.792
What about the building's owners?

01:01:43.959 --> 01:01:47.126
They say it's in disuse but they lie.
The area is contaminated.

01:01:48.126 --> 01:01:50.292
Tell me we have the CCTV recordings.

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:53.917
This is Charlie.

01:01:55.126 --> 01:01:58.876
He went in but he didn't come out.
But he wasn't the only one.

01:01:59.542 --> 01:02:02.542
These two arrived seconds later.
They went in

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:08.584
but they didn't come out either.

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:12.792
- Why would they leave the motorbikes?
- Because they expected to come back.

01:02:12.959 --> 01:02:15.292
- We've found this.
- Take it to Forensics.

01:02:20.417 --> 01:02:23.501
This is just the preview.
The toilet is the big show.

01:02:47.584 --> 01:02:50.001
This door was blocked from inside.

01:02:51.751 --> 01:02:55.792
Here we have some impacts.
On the restroom.

01:03:01.251 --> 01:03:03.792
Charlie's fingerprints are everywhere

01:03:03.959 --> 01:03:06.167
-and we're identifying some others.
- The bikers'?

01:03:06.334 --> 01:03:09.751
Yes, that's what we think.
They fled through this window.

01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:22.292
They took him out from here.

01:03:26.709 --> 01:03:29.042
Carreño, your turn.

01:04:01.459 --> 01:04:03.376
I want a team in the forest.

01:04:03.542 --> 01:04:07.334
And tell traffic to give priority
to the bikers' identification.

01:04:09.084 --> 01:04:10.334
Good job.

01:04:20.751 --> 01:04:23.292
Samuel Garrido, "The Gunman".

01:04:23.459 --> 01:04:24.751
He's always armed.

01:04:24.917 --> 01:04:27.709
He's a criminal record
and he's dangerous.

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:34.334
Hector Duran, "The Heel Man".
He's even worse.

01:04:34.626 --> 01:04:35.834
They didn't go home.

01:04:36.001 --> 01:04:39.584
Their mobiles are off
and they use pre-paid phones.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.917
But on the day
of Charlie's disappearance,

01:04:42.084 --> 01:04:45.584
there was a call flow between Hector
and Samuel's registered numbers

01:04:45.751 --> 01:04:47.251
with Raul Losada.

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:48.459
He works in the port

01:04:48.626 --> 01:04:51.626
and he was absolved
of a crime of extortion 10 years ago.

01:04:52.001 --> 01:04:54.584
Guess who defended him.

01:04:57.376 --> 01:04:58.917
Patricia de Lucas?

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:02.917
They've been in touch since yesterday.

01:05:07.959 --> 01:05:09.251
Are we good?

01:05:10.542 --> 01:05:13.001
- We're good.
- Perfect, then.

01:05:13.167 --> 01:05:15.417
Just a few more protocol details.

01:05:16.084 --> 01:05:18.376
It's important that no delays occur.

01:05:18.542 --> 01:05:21.459
There won't be.
Thank you very much for coming.

01:05:39.417 --> 01:05:41.626
- Can I help you?
- Raul Losada?

01:05:42.626 --> 01:05:43.792
What is this about?

01:05:44.917 --> 01:05:47.709
We have to ask you some questions
about two acquaintances of yours

01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:50.584
and your relationship
with lawyer Patricia de Lucas.

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:54.167
Of course. Could you give me
a couple of minutes?

01:05:54.709 --> 01:05:56.542
I have to cancel a meeting.

01:06:26.251 --> 01:06:27.959
Son of a bitch.

01:07:39.167 --> 01:07:40.042
What?

01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:57.042
Are you at home?

01:08:00.542 --> 01:08:03.417
I cannot tell you now.
Just do as I say.

01:08:09.709 --> 01:08:11.209
Hey! Here!

01:08:19.376 --> 01:08:21.584
Any calls out of the ordinary?

01:08:21.751 --> 01:08:24.042
Think about the details,
it's important.

01:08:24.209 --> 01:08:28.292
Movements in the building, the office,
calls, emails, whatever...

01:08:28.459 --> 01:08:31.751
Will 4 pre-paid mobiles be enough?
What's going on?

01:08:34.167 --> 01:08:37.334
Mrs. de Lucas.
This has just arrived. It's express.

01:08:37.959 --> 01:08:39.001
Thank you.

01:08:42.334 --> 01:08:44.959
- What are we doing with your schedule?
- Cancel everything.

01:08:45.126 --> 01:08:47.584
- Everything?
- Yes. Allege personal reasons.

01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:48.751
Are you sure?

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:52.459
Please, Ines, focus on what I've said,
in the details. Stay alert.

01:08:52.626 --> 01:08:55.334
- Is this for Victor? Is he in danger?
- Do as I say.

01:09:00.626 --> 01:09:01.917
We've just arrived.

01:09:02.167 --> 01:09:03.917
Let someone bring you what you need,

01:09:04.084 --> 01:09:06.667
but don't go out with Victor,
don't even mention him.

01:09:06.834 --> 01:09:08.667
Are you sure
about what you're doing, Patricia?

01:09:08.834 --> 01:09:12.084
I have everything under control.
Thanks Alba.

01:10:22.209 --> 01:10:24.292
- Come with us.
- Where?

01:10:25.001 --> 01:10:26.709
The Inspector will tell you.

01:10:57.542 --> 01:10:59.959
- Come with me.
- What are we doing here?

01:11:00.959 --> 01:11:02.667
Charlie has disappeared.

01:11:02.834 --> 01:11:06.292
It happened before your son confessed
he'd made the kidnapping up.

01:11:06.751 --> 01:11:08.834
We've found his car, his mobile.

01:11:09.001 --> 01:11:11.251
And traces of his blood
in the restroom.

01:11:11.417 --> 01:11:14.126
We've also identified
the alleged attackers.

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:16.417
Now it's only a matter of time
finding them

01:11:16.584 --> 01:11:19.167
and relate them with Raul Losada.
Do you know him?

01:11:19.334 --> 01:11:22.126
If you want to say
something to me, do it now.

01:11:25.126 --> 01:11:26.584
Please.

01:11:31.709 --> 01:11:34.876
Raul Losada called one
of Charlie's alleged attackers

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:36.751
just before he disappeared.

01:11:36.917 --> 01:11:39.376
He ran out
when we mentioned your name.

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.584
He's disappeared with his family.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.667
I want you to see something.

01:11:48.459 --> 01:11:50.251
Give me, I'll hold this for you.

01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:00.042
Do you recognise him?

01:12:00.334 --> 01:12:03.042
It's Charlie,
getting inside that door.

01:12:06.292 --> 01:12:07.251
Follow me.

01:12:34.376 --> 01:12:38.459
He was buried in the forest,
near here.

01:12:41.501 --> 01:12:43.792
Don't you have anything to tell us?

01:12:45.084 --> 01:12:47.001
There's no need to prolong this.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:50.959
You know we know.
But I want you to tell me.

01:12:54.167 --> 01:12:55.876
Am I arrested?

01:13:06.292 --> 01:13:07.584
Am I?

01:13:26.626 --> 01:13:28.376
We'll find Charlie.

01:13:30.542 --> 01:13:32.167
Take her home.

01:14:54.709 --> 01:14:57.251
We'll take a 15 minute break.

01:15:03.251 --> 01:15:05.751
Patricia, are you out of your mind?

01:15:31.042 --> 01:15:33.376
Ignacio Puerta bought his freedom.

01:15:33.542 --> 01:15:35.709
He bribed you and you made my job.

01:15:35.876 --> 01:15:39.667
- His trial was a farce.
- A farce you set up.

01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:42.209
I don't understand
where this is coming from.

01:15:42.376 --> 01:15:44.792
The man that my son said
it was his kidnapper has...

01:15:44.959 --> 01:15:46.876
"disappeared".

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.709
And it's not a good idea
that police finds him.

01:15:49.876 --> 01:15:52.459
- I need to be ahead of them.
- You need another kind of help.

01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:56.751
- I want yours.
- I cannot stop the world, Patricia.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:59.126
But you can make it turn more slowly.

01:16:00.042 --> 01:16:04.626
If I find out what the police knows,
I could prevent whatever is necessary.

01:16:05.376 --> 01:16:09.834
If this comes out,
you won't come off better than me.

01:16:10.001 --> 01:16:13.167
Anything will be better
than being separated from my son.

01:16:40.584 --> 01:16:43.667
Police came to see me yesterday.
They knew everything.

01:16:45.001 --> 01:16:47.542
You've destroyed my life and
you're going to get me out of this.

01:16:47.709 --> 01:16:49.917
We must act before they catch them.

01:16:52.042 --> 01:16:53.542
I know where they hide.

01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:59.709
You're going to help me leave
no trace of them or him.

01:16:59.876 --> 01:17:01.501
You're no longer in charge here.

01:17:01.834 --> 01:17:03.376
Start the fucking car.

01:18:25.751 --> 01:18:27.126
Patricia...

01:18:37.001 --> 01:18:38.209
You scared me!

01:18:38.876 --> 01:18:40.167
Take a look at this.

01:18:50.042 --> 01:18:52.167
They left this so we could find it.

01:18:53.917 --> 01:18:57.417
They've traced a route
from where you were to here.

01:18:57.626 --> 01:18:59.209
They know we're here.

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:10.251
Hello?

01:19:10.417 --> 01:19:12.792
<i>Coming here
hasn't been a good idea, lawyer.</i>

01:19:14.501 --> 01:19:17.251
<i>Tell Raul we'll settle
a score with him.</i>

01:19:17.917 --> 01:19:21.501
Please, let's find a solution
to all of this.

01:19:22.084 --> 01:19:24.001
<i>Sit in front of the laptop.</i>

01:19:28.209 --> 01:19:30.001
<i>Do you see the red pen drive?</i>

01:19:30.542 --> 01:19:34.334
<i>Those are the instructions
to deliver the money tomorrow.</i>

01:19:34.501 --> 01:19:36.084
<i>Open the minimized window.</i>

01:19:44.084 --> 01:19:45.459
What have you done to him?

01:19:45.751 --> 01:19:49.834
Don't worry. He's a good kid.
He keeps us company.

01:19:50.376 --> 01:19:52.876
<i>If you want to see him alive,
you know what you have to do!</i>

01:19:57.792 --> 01:19:59.167
There's no way back.

01:20:09.959 --> 01:20:11.917
Come on,
let's get out of here right now!

01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:29.626
Get out.

01:20:47.126 --> 01:20:51.792
Sell the house, the bonds, the shares,
everything. In notes of 500.

01:20:51.959 --> 01:20:53.667
I'll make a few calls.

01:21:04.959 --> 01:21:07.417
She's just asked six million
for tomorrow.

01:21:07.584 --> 01:21:08.459
<i>Give her what she asks.</i>

01:21:08.626 --> 01:21:10.834
I'll call you later with instructions.

01:21:12.667 --> 01:21:13.667
What do we have?

01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:16.376
I've sent the blood samples to the lab.

01:21:16.542 --> 01:21:18.709
Chief, I got confirmation.

01:21:18.876 --> 01:21:23.334
The burned Opel Corsa was stolen
near the dog fight's venue.

01:21:23.917 --> 01:21:25.667
We must find the corpse.

01:21:35.042 --> 01:21:36.334
What did you find out?

01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:38.376
They know it'll be tomorrow
and they want to catch you

01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:42.959
during the exchange
in order to get to the missing man.

01:21:58.751 --> 01:21:59.584
Tell me.

01:21:59.751 --> 01:22:01.251
<i>- Are you in the office?
- Yes.</i>

01:22:01.417 --> 01:22:03.001
You have to leave now.

01:22:10.167 --> 01:22:12.667
- The target is on the move.
- Copy that.

01:22:12.834 --> 01:22:14.417
We know where she's going.

01:22:15.501 --> 01:22:17.292
Places, everyone!

01:22:18.042 --> 01:22:21.167
Remember: we have to arrest her
when she delivers the money.

01:22:21.334 --> 01:22:22.459
Come on, Vicky.

01:22:37.292 --> 01:22:38.667
She's arriving.

01:23:09.376 --> 01:23:10.709
She's here.

01:23:10.959 --> 01:23:12.542
Is the GPS in place?

01:23:12.709 --> 01:23:15.001
<i>Yes, I've done everything you asked.</i>

01:23:16.001 --> 01:23:17.167
Activate it.

01:23:49.251 --> 01:23:50.334
Chief, she's moving.

01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:53.251
Nobody does anything.
She's ours now, understood?

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.667
What's going on?
Do you have visual contact on her?

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:11.626
Affirmative.

01:24:11.792 --> 01:24:13.209
<i>She's going to the toilet.</i>

01:25:00.334 --> 01:25:02.292
- And now?
- She's still inside.

01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:11.584
Vicky, go check what's going on.

01:25:49.584 --> 01:25:50.834
<i>The bird has flown.</i>

01:25:51.626 --> 01:25:54.834
Fucking hell! Give me details.

01:25:55.001 --> 01:25:57.292
<i>The tracer is hidden
behind the toilet.</i>

01:25:57.459 --> 01:25:59.626
<i>There are no windows
or open ventilation circuits here.</i>

01:25:59.792 --> 01:26:02.334
Stay here and keep your eyes open.
She cannot have escaped.

01:26:05.126 --> 01:26:08.501
- Has anyone left?
- Just 3 women, but none was her.

01:26:20.209 --> 01:26:21.959
Have you seen this woman?

01:26:41.876 --> 01:26:43.792
- I'm 10 minutes away.
- What about the police?

01:26:43.959 --> 01:26:46.626
I've distracted them,
but not for a longtime.

01:26:47.501 --> 01:26:49.792
Try to get
some more information from her.

01:26:50.459 --> 01:26:51.792
Carreño, do you copy?

01:26:51.959 --> 01:26:53.376
We've got her secretary.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.751
She's left her some clothes
and her car. I'm sending the data.

01:26:58.084 --> 01:27:01.251
We got her, Chief.
Agent 348 has visual contact.

01:27:29.042 --> 01:27:31.251
She's moving and carrying a briefcase.
What do I do?

01:27:31.417 --> 01:27:34.084
Nothing, unless the delivery takes place.

01:27:34.376 --> 01:27:36.042
<i>We're there in 5 minutes.</i>

01:27:54.042 --> 01:27:55.917
She's getting in another car.

01:27:56.376 --> 01:27:58.334
- With the briefcase?
- Affirmative.

01:27:58.542 --> 01:28:01.542
- Copy, 348, follow her.
- Copy that.

01:29:05.042 --> 01:29:07.417
- Do you have the money?
- We do.

01:29:08.459 --> 01:29:09.834
Switch the GPS on.

01:29:12.376 --> 01:29:13.167
Done.

01:29:13.334 --> 01:29:14.834
<i>Follow the programmed route.</i>

01:29:15.584 --> 01:29:18.542
<i>348, we're here. She's ours.</i>

01:29:27.584 --> 01:29:30.542
By the way, you'll also have
to get rid of the corpse.

01:29:30.709 --> 01:29:31.626
It's behind you.

01:29:44.001 --> 01:29:46.751
Lawyer, follow the route
and you'll find the kid.

01:29:47.167 --> 01:29:49.917
<i>In the destination, someone
will take care of the corpse.</i>

01:29:50.084 --> 01:29:52.667
If something happens to my son,
there will be no place in the world

01:29:52.834 --> 01:29:55.917
-where you could hide.
- Good luck, lawyer.

01:31:42.001 --> 01:31:44.792
Where are the fucking reinforcements?
We're losing her.

01:31:49.584 --> 01:31:50.251
Goddamn it!

01:31:57.667 --> 01:31:59.876
Fucking hell!

01:34:06.667 --> 01:34:08.459
Oh, my love!

01:34:14.126 --> 01:34:15.792
Are you okay?

01:34:17.126 --> 01:34:18.167
Wait.

01:34:21.834 --> 01:34:23.251
Here, come.

01:34:26.626 --> 01:34:28.292
Did they hurt you?

01:34:28.459 --> 01:34:33.042
No, he hit Alba.

01:34:42.126 --> 01:34:43.209
Victor,

01:34:44.126 --> 01:34:47.709
next time you're scared, don't hide.

01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:53.209
Tell me. Tell me always,
don't be embarrassed anymore.

01:34:54.334 --> 01:34:57.292
If you don't know something, ask.

01:34:58.167 --> 01:35:01.626
Learn to get help.

01:35:02.334 --> 01:35:08.667
Because that's being strong:
knowing how to get help.

01:35:11.126 --> 01:35:14.501
And now, you have to be strong,

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:17.917
because Mum
has to talk with the police.

01:35:18.084 --> 01:35:21.626
You stay here, don't go out.

01:35:25.792 --> 01:35:27.376
Give me a huge kiss.

01:35:37.834 --> 01:35:41.001
- Mum...
- What, my love?

01:35:41.667 --> 01:35:43.001
Don't leave me.

01:35:45.209 --> 01:35:46.209
No.

01:35:51.209 --> 01:35:55.542
Look, even if you and I are apart,

01:35:56.417 --> 01:35:59.126
we'll always be together.

01:36:01.251 --> 01:36:03.376
Alba will take care of you.

01:36:07.751 --> 01:36:11.209
He gave me this for you.

01:36:33.876 --> 01:36:34.876
Laia...

01:36:52.376 --> 01:36:55.501
- I love you, honey.
- I love you too.

01:37:53.834 --> 01:37:55.376
Tell me everything.

01:38:06.876 --> 01:38:08.959
No, no, stay here!

01:38:10.209 --> 01:38:11.626
I want you to see him.

01:38:25.834 --> 01:38:27.959
What the hell is going on here?

01:38:29.584 --> 01:38:30.292
But...

01:38:35.501 --> 01:38:36.834
Son of a bitch.

01:40:35.001 --> 01:40:38.751
No!
