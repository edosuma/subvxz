00:21.088 --> 00:23.075
You can't turn the sink on

00:23.076 --> 00:25.041
This is not some fancy hotel.

00:25.042 --> 00:27.003
Okay, I'm sorry,
I overslept.

00:27.004 --> 00:28.062
I'm running late for a meeting
with the vice principal.

00:28.063 --> 00:31.003
Please get out of here
so I can save

00:31.004 --> 00:32.999
a little bit
of my dignity.

I'm not gonna do it, Schmidt,

- Well, I'm gonna keep asking, so just do it.
- Look,

00:40.076 --> 00:42.031
I'm not doing it until
you tell me why you've had

00:42.032 --> 00:44.012
time to shave your chest
but not your face.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.007
Ugh, Jess, would you
please scratch an itch

00:48.008 --> 00:49.069
I have
on my undercarriage?

00:49.070 --> 00:51.042
I can't get the right angle
and Winston refuses.

00:51.043 --> 00:53.011
No, I don't have
time, Schmidt.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.054
Jess, please, I-I--
this is awful.

00:54.055 --> 00:57.011
I feel like I dropped
something in there.

00:57.012 --> 00:58.999
You hear that? Loose change.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.069
I thought
we talked

01:00.070 --> 01:02.096
about you not wearing your
shower diaper in the kitchen.

01:02.097 --> 01:05.037
Excuse me, do you think
this has been easy for me--

01:05.038 --> 01:08.061
to wash myself all summer long
with a penis cast on?

01:08.062 --> 01:10.000
Thank God this thing
comes off this afternoon.

01:10.001 --> 01:13.041
And by the way, I know
what you've been thinking,

01:13.042 --> 01:14.094
and the answer
is yes,

01:14.095 --> 01:16.054
I have been able
to reach completion

01:16.055 --> 01:19.045
with some very precise
and vigorous nipple play.

01:19.046 --> 01:20.999
Nipple play-- off-limits.

01:21.000 --> 01:22.096
Wait, Jess, please,
I-I'm begging you.

01:22.097 --> 01:24.016
Okay, fine.

01:24.017 --> 01:26.041
Just get it,
just get it in there

01:26.042 --> 01:28.042
- in the back.
- Stop moving like that.

There you go.

Oh, thank God.

01:35.004 --> 01:36.038
- What do you mean?

Hi, Tanya, um,
sorry I'm late.

02:05.067 --> 02:07.024
Take a seat.

02:07.025 --> 02:08.044
Okay.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.002
Is everything all right?

02:10.003 --> 02:11.079
I'll give you
the bad news first.

02:11.080 --> 02:12.082
Okay.

02:12.083 --> 02:15.007
The bad news is, is that
cutbacks are forcing me

02:15.008 --> 02:17.096
to lay off ten percent
of our nontenured teachers.

02:17.097 --> 02:19.070
That's terrible.

02:19.071 --> 02:22.038
But the bad news is, is that
it seems you are one of them.

02:25.004 --> 02:27.008
That's not how
you deliver news.

02:29.008 --> 02:30.038
What are you doing?

02:30.039 --> 02:32.082
Trying to make this
more fun.

02:32.083 --> 02:35.042
- No.
- You're right.

02:35.045 --> 02:38.041
Tanya, I'm a really
good teacher.

02:38.042 --> 02:40.016
I care about my kids.

02:40.017 --> 02:41.058
I spent
two months

02:41.059 --> 02:45.011
in summer school with an
Indian student named Vaj Rejuv

02:45.012 --> 02:48.087
and I did not laugh
once, not once.

02:48.088 --> 02:51.057
I'm sorry, Jess,
but on the plus side...

02:51.058 --> 02:53.061
you can have
anything you want

02:53.062 --> 02:55.999
out of the
lost-and-found box.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.083
Okay.

03:01.083 --> 03:03.067
- Good choice.
- Thank you for the opportunity.

03:03.068 --> 03:05.067
Um, it's been an
honor working here.

03:06.083 --> 03:09.024
The dictionary
defines "teacher" as...

03:09.025 --> 03:11.062
Okay, you can take another one.

03:16.088 --> 03:18.036
No, you can't
share a bowl of cereal.

03:18.037 --> 03:19.067
Why not?

03:19.068 --> 03:21.095
The cast is off, gentlemen.

03:21.096 --> 03:24.058
- Great. Congratulations, man.
- Good news, man.

03:24.061 --> 03:27.017
Oh! - Oh!
Yeah, take it in.

03:27.018 --> 03:29.008
- Goodness, the smell, man.
- We have done nothing but love you, Schmidt.

03:29.011 --> 03:32.003
Soak it all in,
in all its foul glory.

03:32.004 --> 03:33.065
That is not just some

03:33.066 --> 03:35.050
disgusting, salty
bundle of gauze.

03:35.051 --> 03:38.061
That is a symbol of who I was
for the past two months:

03:38.062 --> 03:40.016
The broken-penis guy.

03:40.017 --> 03:42.040
But if there's anything
that majoring in marketing

03:42.041 --> 03:45.007
with a minor in theater studies
has taught me,

03:45.008 --> 03:46.079
it's that everybody has a brand.

03:46.080 --> 03:49.066
Nick, your brand
is gypsy alcoholic handyman.

03:49.067 --> 03:50.070
Winston,

03:50.071 --> 03:52.037
your brand is Winston.

03:53.071 --> 03:55.037
Nicholas, Winstoniel,

03:55.038 --> 03:58.053
I'm staging an event to
relaunch the Schmidt brand.

03:58.054 --> 04:00.038
It's going to happen
this Saturday night,

04:00.039 --> 04:02.082
and it is going
to be epic.

04:02.083 --> 04:03.998
You're having a party
to tell girls

04:03.999 --> 04:05.029
you're ready
to have sex again?

04:05.030 --> 04:09.024
Not a party;
A rebranding event.

04:09.025 --> 04:10.086
Please tell me
there's not a theme.

04:10.087 --> 04:12.073
There most certainly is
a theme-- it is a secret

04:12.074 --> 04:14.067
- that will be announced on the night.
- I bet it's danger.

04:14.068 --> 04:16.050
No, you're... you're wrong.
It's not danger.

04:16.051 --> 04:18.067
- It'll be announced on the night.
- I really think

04:18.070 --> 04:20.041
- It's going to be danger.
- I'm going to go with danger.

04:20.043 --> 04:22.010
Come on, man, it's not danger.
Stop guessing danger.

04:22.011 --> 04:23.090
Who'd you invite?

04:23.091 --> 04:25.048
The ladies from Lululemon,
my urologist,

04:25.049 --> 04:27.004
my badminton partner,
my financial planner,

04:27.005 --> 04:29.011
Philip Seymour Hoffman
and a guy who once wrote

04:29.012 --> 04:31.020
for a little show
called Crank Yankers.

04:31.021 --> 04:32.081
And obviously Cece.

04:32.082 --> 04:34.075
She hasn't spoken
to you all summer--

04:34.076 --> 04:36.061
since you broke
up with her.

04:36.062 --> 04:37.086
Yeah, I'm over it.

04:37.087 --> 04:39.062
It's not about her.
I hope she comes.

04:39.063 --> 04:41.062
Now, let's talk venue.

04:43.017 --> 04:44.999
Jess, oh, my God.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.041
Are you okay?

04:46.042 --> 04:48.017
How long have you
been sitting here?

04:49.088 --> 04:52.091
I panicked,
and I grabbed the hat.

04:52.092 --> 04:56.003
I should have grabbed the yo-yo
or the slap bracelet,

04:56.004 --> 04:59.087
and now all I have
is this stupid hat.

04:59.088 --> 05:02.012
- I'm sorry.
- No, you're right.

05:02.015 --> 05:04.046
I'm overthinking it.
The hat's fine.

05:06.017 --> 05:07.075
You take me home?

05:07.076 --> 05:09.007
Yeah, of course.

05:09.008 --> 05:10.052
I-I can't go
upstairs, though,

05:10.053 --> 05:12.012
'cause of the whole
Schmidt thing.

05:12.013 --> 05:14.028
It's going to be
okay, all right?

05:14.029 --> 05:16.044
I mean, this is the moment
before something amazing

05:16.045 --> 05:18.029
is going to happen
for you. I promise.

05:18.030 --> 05:19.058
Put these on.

05:21.088 --> 05:23.007
Is this making you
feel better?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.050
I've decided to host my

05:29.051 --> 05:31.071
- relaunch event at Nick's bar.
- No.

05:31.072 --> 05:33.065
And you, my friend,
are bartending.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.079
Don't make me work for you.
You can have everything else.

05:35.080 --> 05:37.024
Come on, man.
You're perfect.

05:37.025 --> 05:38.060
You bring the heat,
but you're not

05:38.061 --> 05:39.067
a threat in the
looks department.

05:39.068 --> 05:41.050
- I get that, actually.
- And only you

05:41.051 --> 05:42.092
Can make those fruity
drinks that used to make

05:42.093 --> 05:45.066
the girls lose their
minds in college.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.088
Fine, I'll do it,
but I'm not making those drinks.

05:47.089 --> 05:50.024
Oh, come on, Nick.
You have a gift.

05:50.025 --> 05:52.067
Why you always trying to hide
your light under a bushel?

05:52.068 --> 05:55.087
Because, sure, I could get
a girl topless, no bra,

05:55.088 --> 05:57.053
with one hollowed-out papaya,

05:57.054 --> 05:59.087
some crushed ice
and two fingers of rum,

05:59.088 --> 06:01.066
but then I grew up.

06:01.067 --> 06:04.066
Now I only want to make a drink
that a coal miner would want.

06:04.067 --> 06:07.032
Straightforward, honest.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.011
Something that says,
"I work in a hole."

06:10.012 --> 06:11.092
And I'm especially not making
those drinks for you.

06:11.093 --> 06:13.067
- What? Why?
- 'Cause you can't handle it.

06:13.068 --> 06:14.090
You drink them way too fast,
and then you get weird.

06:14.091 --> 06:16.073
Oh, come on. That was,
like, years ago, dude.

06:16.074 --> 06:18.027
I'm a changed man.
I mean, look at me.

06:18.028 --> 06:19.075
- I'm wearing a suit.
- A suit? Please.

06:19.076 --> 06:21.044
That's something they
put on Morgan Freeman

06:21.045 --> 06:23.073
when they let him out of
Shawshank. Look at that.

06:23.074 --> 06:25.002
What, did a magician
die in that thing?

06:28.017 --> 06:29.074
Hi.

06:29.075 --> 06:31.028
I got laid off.

06:31.029 --> 06:33.004
- What? Are you serious?
- Oh, my God.

06:33.007 --> 06:34.092
- What happened?
- Obama.

06:34.095 --> 06:37.028
It's possible
I'm still in shock.

06:37.029 --> 06:41.091
I'm going to go to my room
and process what just happened.

06:41.092 --> 06:44.062
Thank you for your attention.

06:46.033 --> 06:48.045
Ah, this is not good.
Now she's going to cry.

06:48.046 --> 06:49.060
I hate it when she cries.

06:49.061 --> 06:50.092
Her face gets all red and puffy.

06:50.093 --> 06:52.075
- Makes me sick.
- Okay, we got to

06:52.076 --> 06:53.088
Fix this right now, guys.

06:53.089 --> 06:55.074
Let's go.
We got to do something.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.092
- Okay. Here's how this is going to go.
- Hi.

07:02.095 --> 07:04.049
You will not pity me.

07:04.050 --> 07:07.007
No pity eyes.
Schmidt, stop looking at me

07:07.008 --> 07:08.062
like I'm a fat kid
riding a bike.

07:08.063 --> 07:11.074
It's just a job.
I'll get a new one.

07:11.075 --> 07:13.999
You're going to get so many
jobs, Jess. I promise.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.058
So I just want you to go
about your day and act normal.

07:16.059 --> 07:19.049
Okay?

07:19.050 --> 07:20.054
What's wrong
with your eyes, Nick?

07:22.071 --> 07:24.050
Stop blinking.
Why are you doing that?

07:24.051 --> 07:27.011
I just think they fired
the wrong girl, kid.

07:27.012 --> 07:29.012
Oh, for sure.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.053
Stop. Nick!

07:31.054 --> 07:33.016
What's up?

07:33.017 --> 07:34.088
- What's wrong with you?
- You wiggin'?

07:34.091 --> 07:36.083
- Act normal, okay?
- If that's what you want.

07:36.086 --> 07:39.008
- That is what I want.
- That's what you'll get.

07:39.009 --> 07:40.052
Where you going, Schmidt?

07:40.053 --> 07:41.062
Sorry. This way.

07:41.063 --> 07:43.017
Bye.

07:48.567 --> 07:49.732
Hey, hey.

07:49.733 --> 07:50.761
Hey.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.550
- How you doing, kid?
- Great.

07:52.551 --> 07:54.229
My boobs are loving
this unemployed thing.

07:54.280 --> 07:56.287
They don't have to go
to boob jail every day.

07:57.288 --> 07:59.266
Job hunt is on.

07:59.267 --> 08:03.270
This hospital Web site
says I can earn up to $700,

08:03.271 --> 08:06.257
and all I have to do is be
infected with dengue fever.

08:06.258 --> 08:08.287
Are you sure you're okay?

08:08.288 --> 08:09.302
For the thousandth time, yes.

08:09.303 --> 08:11.265
I know you've been
waiting all week

08:11.266 --> 08:12.325
for me to break down,
but I'm fine.

08:12.326 --> 08:14.299
Just be normal.

08:14.300 --> 08:15.342
- I'm being normal.
- You're crossing your legs.

08:15.345 --> 08:17.307
I always do this.

08:17.308 --> 08:19.306
You've never crossed your legs
in your entire life.

08:19.307 --> 08:21.292
I didn't even know
you were that flexible.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.329
- Well...
- And stop being nice to me.

08:23.332 --> 08:26.266
What, I'm not normally
nice to you, Jess?

08:26.267 --> 08:29.257
No. You're mean,
like a crazy old man.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.256
"I'm Nick. I hate sunshine.

08:32.258 --> 08:34.303
"When did gum get so fancy?

08:34.304 --> 08:37.303
This escalator
goes too fast."

08:37.304 --> 08:39.270
Be mean.

08:39.270 --> 08:42.249
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.346
Sorry. That... that was in
my head a little.

08:43.347 --> 08:46.299
Look sharp, you dumb-ass.

08:46.300 --> 08:48.312
- No. Tighten up!
- That's terrible.

08:48.313 --> 08:50.281
I don't have it today.
I don't know what it is.

08:50.282 --> 08:51.302
Can you
believe that the zoo

08:51.303 --> 08:53.260
wouldn't let me borrow
their white tiger?

08:53.261 --> 08:54.315
I mean, the nerve.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.331
I'm going to be sitting
in the back of the party,

08:56.332 --> 08:58.294
and Philip Seymour Hoffman's
going to be like,

08:58.295 --> 09:00.304
"Look at that idiot who
couldn't even get a big cat."

09:00.305 --> 09:02.332
Schmidt, you need a tiger.

09:02.333 --> 09:04.303
I need a job.

09:05.304 --> 09:06.266
Hire me.

09:06.267 --> 09:07.296
- No.
- Here...

09:07.297 --> 09:08.342
- No, I'm not going to...
- Schmidt!

09:08.345 --> 09:11.250
- What are you...?
- Hire me. I am a people person.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.296
I'm great at parties.

09:12.297 --> 09:14.296
I can make any kind
of balloon animal,

09:14.297 --> 09:17.270
as long as it's a worm
or a snake...

09:17.271 --> 09:19.304
- No, Jess.
- Come on.

09:19.307 --> 09:22.274
Help a brother out.

09:22.275 --> 09:24.260
Jess, you just got
laid off, okay?

09:24.261 --> 09:26.292
I can't have an emotionally
vulnerable person on my crew.

09:26.293 --> 09:29.287
Tonight is about one man's
functioning penis.

09:29.288 --> 09:30.306
I wouldn't say functioning.

09:30.307 --> 09:31.342
I saw what you did
to the toilet seat.

09:31.343 --> 09:34.299
And I'm not unstable.
I just need a job.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.256
Okay, fine.
You know what, Jess? Fine.

09:36.257 --> 09:37.329
You can be my other shot girl.

09:37.330 --> 09:40.267
- Yes!
- A shot girl? No, you can't be a shot girl.

09:40.270 --> 09:41.299
Why not?

09:41.300 --> 09:42.319
Because you don't have

09:42.320 --> 09:44.300
that specific hotness
that shames men

09:44.301 --> 09:46.303
into spending nine dollars
on a two-dollar shot.

09:46.304 --> 09:48.342
- She doesn't have it.
- Are you saying I'm not hot?

09:48.345 --> 09:51.341
No, no, no, I'm not...
No, no, you're hot, you're hot.

09:51.342 --> 09:54.262
- Nick!
- I'm saying you're the nurse

09:54.265 --> 09:57.261
That I want to wake up to
after having my stomach pumped.

09:57.262 --> 09:58.310
You know what I mean?

09:58.311 --> 10:00.304
Its a different kind of hot--
still hot.

10:00.305 --> 10:02.304
I'm going to be
a great shot girl, Nick.

10:02.305 --> 10:04.316
I pour liquids into cups
every single day.

10:04.317 --> 10:07.282
Add on top of that two years
of light tap and jazz.

10:07.283 --> 10:09.288
Please, I feel... I feel you
overthinking this already.

10:09.289 --> 10:11.295
I'm going to be the best
shot girl in the world.

10:11.296 --> 10:12.333
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

10:12.336 --> 10:14.258
Getting my costume.

10:16.321 --> 10:18.337
Hiya, big boy.

10:18.338 --> 10:20.303
What's your poison?

10:20.304 --> 10:22.312
- Oh...
- What?

10:22.315 --> 10:25.291
Yeah, interesting choices.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.296
It's a great hat.
Can I have it?

10:29.262 --> 10:30.340
Let's get rid of that.

10:30.341 --> 10:32.338
I've decided that
tonight my name is Ivy,

10:32.339 --> 10:35.257
and I'm studying
to be an actress,

10:35.258 --> 10:37.257
and I'll sleep with you
if you give me a part

10:37.258 --> 10:38.804
- in a Paramount picture.
- Do you have another

10:38.805 --> 10:41.274
Outfit in your car, or are you
going to stick with this one?

10:41.275 --> 10:42.304
Hey, young man, why
weren't you drafted?

10:42.305 --> 10:45.304
- You like someone?
- Good stuff.

10:45.305 --> 10:47.283
Schmidt! Just the guy
I was looking for.

10:47.284 --> 10:50.258
- So the theme of the party is...
- Is danger.

10:50.259 --> 10:51.342
That's right, but it's
on a level that you

10:51.343 --> 10:54.279
- couldn't possibly understand, Nick.
- Okay.

10:54.280 --> 10:56.262
Just, where... where
is the other shot girl?

10:56.263 --> 10:58.271
- I don't know, boss.
- Here I am.

10:58.274 --> 11:00.324
Casey. Thank you for
joining us. Great.

11:00.325 --> 11:01.346
Here's where it's at.

11:01.347 --> 11:03.287
I don't work with amateurs.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.302
I don't split tips.

11:04.303 --> 11:06.281
Things get a little freaky
in here, I'm out the door

11:06.282 --> 11:08.281
because I'm a little diabetic
and I don't need a hassle.

11:08.282 --> 11:10.321
And also, I do accept payment
in the form of whippets

11:10.322 --> 11:12.261
because I've got a PhD;

11:12.262 --> 11:15.292
- a Pretty Heavy Drug Problem.
- Oh.

11:15.293 --> 11:16.296
How old are you?

11:16.297 --> 11:18.308
Twenty-six.

11:21.342 --> 11:22.900
Thank you for your honesty.

11:27.271 --> 11:29.282
Yeah! Who's up?

11:29.283 --> 11:32.257
Okay, you jerk, come here.
Stupid jerk.

11:33.339 --> 11:36.295
Who wants a shot of firewater?

11:36.296 --> 11:39.317
Anybody want me to wet
their whistle?

11:41.312 --> 11:42.295
Hey, Schmidt.

11:43.296 --> 11:45.325
It's working, Nick. Look at all
these beautiful ladies.

11:45.826 --> 11:47.761
And this is just
the beginning, man.

11:47.762 --> 11:48.833
I can take this to the next
level whenever I want.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.774
You know why? 'Cause I got
something up my sleeve.

11:51.775 --> 11:53.841
Schmidt, please,
nothing up your sleeve.

11:53.842 --> 11:56.767
It never works!

11:58.000 --> 12:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:09.804 --> 12:13.767
Remain in your seat and finish
the exam, Mr. Schmidt.

12:15.767 --> 12:17.778
You know,
in Student Health Services,

12:17.779 --> 12:19.771
they still call that
"Schmidting the bed."

12:19.772 --> 12:21.749
Why are you proud
of that?

12:21.750 --> 12:22.765
What the hell
is this?

12:22.766 --> 12:23.783
Come on, Schmidt,
you know I don't

12:23.784 --> 12:25.829
- make girly drinks any more.
- I didn't buy that stuff.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.788
You didn't buy this?
Then who did?

12:30.771 --> 12:31.783
What's my name?

12:31.784 --> 12:32.837
Casey!

12:32.838 --> 12:34.803
You're all a bunch of jerks.

12:34.804 --> 12:38.782
Yes! My penis is working!

12:38.783 --> 12:40.783
Casey!

12:45.792 --> 12:47.779
Hey. - Hey.
Hey-hey!

12:47.782 --> 12:48.808
Cece.

12:49.846 --> 12:52.845
I had to check out the new
and improved Schmidt.

12:52.846 --> 12:54.842
Been hearing
so much about it, so...

12:54.843 --> 12:56.749
I'm really glad that you came.

12:56.750 --> 12:57.838
Look, I wanted
to tell you...

12:57.839 --> 13:00.841
I want you to meet Robby,
my, uh, my boyfriend.

13:00.842 --> 13:01.812
Your what?

13:02.813 --> 13:04.753
There he is.

13:04.754 --> 13:06.770
The one shaped
like a Liberty Bell?

13:06.771 --> 13:09.767
It's a great party.
Thank you for inviting us.

13:13.829 --> 13:15.829
- Flip it, man, flip it!
- I'm flipping it!

13:17.832 --> 13:18.782
Did you guys see

13:18.783 --> 13:20.775
Cece's new boyfriend,
the commoner?

13:22.771 --> 13:25.787
Oh, wow, Schmidty,
you really lowered Cece's bar.

13:25.788 --> 13:26.833
There's got to be an explanation
for this,

13:26.834 --> 13:28.782
like he's the Lord of Winterfell

13:28.783 --> 13:30.767
or he's working with
a real piece of pipe.

13:30.768 --> 13:33.791
Schmidt? Schmidt, don't get
hung up on that guy.

13:33.792 --> 13:35.803
And here comes the weirdness.

13:35.804 --> 13:37.846
Not weird, just a guy
who really wants a drink.

13:38.846 --> 13:42.803
Mm-mmm! Mmm...

13:42.804 --> 13:44.757
Mmm!

13:44.758 --> 13:45.788
It's like an explosion
of fruit!

13:45.789 --> 13:46.795
There it is.

13:46.796 --> 13:48.757
Look at me being so naughty!

13:49.817 --> 13:51.842
So naughty.

13:57.788 --> 13:59.783
- Hey.
- I'm Schmidt.

13:59.786 --> 14:02.828
I, too, was a sexual
partner of Cece.

14:02.829 --> 14:04.825
- Welcome to the party.
- Thank you for having me.

14:04.826 --> 14:05.838
Let me just tell you

14:05.839 --> 14:07.770
this is a very
impressive party.

14:07.771 --> 14:09.748
There's speakers everywhere.
There's one over there.

14:09.749 --> 14:10.810
I saw two on the back wall.

14:10.811 --> 14:12.846
Oh, there's one right there.
Didn't see that one before.

14:12.847 --> 14:15.804
- Yeah, there's a lot of speakers. Lot of...
- Lots of speakers. Yeah.

14:15.807 --> 14:17.749
So, so what's your deal?

14:17.750 --> 14:19.787
I mean, do you vacation
in Europe ever?

14:19.788 --> 14:20.846
No. You know, I've never left

14:20.847 --> 14:23.825
- California in my life.
- You in a band?

14:23.828 --> 14:26.828
I don't, I don't like music.
What's up with me, you know?

14:26.829 --> 14:29.775
- You work for Goldman then?
- For who?

14:29.778 --> 14:31.824
This feels good.
I'm gonna go.

14:31.825 --> 14:34.825
Congratulations
on your penis, man.

14:35.821 --> 14:37.770
What's your name?

14:37.771 --> 14:40.749
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my God. Oh!

14:40.750 --> 14:41.762
Could I get a broom?!

14:42.775 --> 14:43.825
Look at my butt.

14:43.826 --> 14:45.846
Look at my butt, stupid jerks.

14:54.783 --> 14:55.820
Hey, Jess.

14:55.821 --> 14:57.761
Nick, I'm fine.

14:57.762 --> 14:59.766
I don't need you to be nice
to me right now.

15:00.767 --> 15:02.837
Okay. You want me to be mean?

15:02.838 --> 15:04.812
- Yes.
- I'll give you mean, Jess.

15:04.815 --> 15:07.774
This is the easiest job
in the whole world!

15:07.775 --> 15:09.787
The only thing
easier than this

15:09.788 --> 15:11.845
is passing out cigarettes
to prisoners.

15:11.846 --> 15:15.766
And what if I wanted to
take a body shot off you?

15:16.767 --> 15:20.749
Oh, yeah! I can't
because you're wearing

15:20.750 --> 15:22.774
a turn-of-the-century
bathing costume.

15:22.775 --> 15:25.749
How's this? Are you getting mad
or are you happy with this?

15:25.750 --> 15:26.762
It's good.
That's really good.

15:26.763 --> 15:28.816
So stop feeling sorry
for yourself, kid,

15:28.817 --> 15:32.778
and get up on that bar and
shake that piece of plywood

15:32.779 --> 15:34.754
- that you call an ass!
- That's too far!

15:34.757 --> 15:37.779
- Yeah, yeah, I agree. You got a great ass.
- That is too far!

15:37.780 --> 15:38.808
That is too far.

15:38.809 --> 15:41.771
This is so fun!

16:17.759 --> 16:18.829
- Right.
- I think I can get Cece back.

16:18.832 --> 16:20.753
Seriously,
just let it go.

16:20.754 --> 16:23.774
I just need to remind her
how amazing I am.

16:23.775 --> 16:26.770
Luckily, I've got something
up my sleeve.

16:26.771 --> 16:27.792
Schmidt, no, no!
Schmidt, don't!

16:27.793 --> 16:29.771
Schmidt, no sleeves, please!

Shot girl!

Shot girl!

16:46.754 --> 16:48.837
I'm a shot girl.

16:51.804 --> 16:53.767
Oh.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.804
I'm a shot girl.

17:01.754 --> 17:03.816
Hey, J-Jess, Jess.

17:03.817 --> 17:04.846
Jess, where are you going?

17:04.847 --> 17:07.807
What am I doing, Nick?
I'm a teacher.

17:07.808 --> 17:09.808
I'm not a shot girl.

17:19.775 --> 17:22.749
Fire...

17:22.750 --> 17:26.758
the most dangerous element
of all of the elements.

17:27.750 --> 17:28.842
Now I'm doing this.

17:28.843 --> 17:31.749
Okay, let's see here.

17:31.750 --> 17:34.749
And then now I'm doing this.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.795
Sure. And now I'm not sure
what I'm doing.

17:36.796 --> 17:39.770
I'm not actually quite sure
how to stop this.

17:39.771 --> 17:41.811
Um, this is definitely
real fire.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.753
I'm very apologetic.
I think everyone should leave.

17:44.754 --> 17:45.842
Um, thank you very much
for coming.

17:45.843 --> 17:47.791
There's party favors
at the door.

17:47.792 --> 17:50.749
I'd like to thank my urologist
for coming.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.756
Oh, wait. No, no, no,
everybody, look.

17:56.757 --> 17:57.846
I'm okay.
I got it under control.

17:57.847 --> 18:00.771
Cece, watch this one.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.771
Hey, look, Cece. Fire!

18:14.762 --> 18:16.803
Where's Robby?

18:16.804 --> 18:17.842
Pulling the car around.

18:17.843 --> 18:19.757
You really scared him.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.342
Why haven't you called me back
in two months, Cece?

18:22.843 --> 18:24.757
You are the one
who broke up with me.

18:24.758 --> 18:25.842
I don't see you
until you show up here tonight

18:25.843 --> 18:27.837
with... with a boyfriend?

18:28.338 --> 18:31.337
And please, please tell me
he's on some sort of medication

18:31.338 --> 18:33.321
that's making him
temporarily bloated.

18:33.322 --> 18:35.253
Come on, okay?

18:35.254 --> 18:36.329
You and I both know
we never would have worked.

18:36.330 --> 18:38.275
We are far too alike.

18:40.271 --> 18:42.329
Both so beautiful.

18:48.321 --> 18:51.258
You're gonna be fine.
You know that, right?

18:53.338 --> 18:56.341
Hey, uh, Cece, I...

18:56.342 --> 19:00.249
I got to know, why him?

19:00.250 --> 19:02.337
I mean, what, what is his brand?

19:02.338 --> 19:04.295
He's just a good guy.

19:04.296 --> 19:06.341
And I'm...

19:06.342 --> 19:08.266
too dangerous?

19:08.267 --> 19:10.275
Yeah, that's it.

19:12.275 --> 19:13.337
I'll see you around, Schmidt.

19:13.338 --> 19:16.258
Yeah.

19:19.275 --> 19:20.316
Fun fact:

19:20.317 --> 19:23.311
There's a reason why guys
nickname me "T-Ball."

19:23.312 --> 19:25.261
When they step up
to the plate,

19:25.262 --> 19:26.312
they never strike out.

19:26.313 --> 19:29.261
Honey, what happened to you
in your life

19:29.262 --> 19:30.302
that made you like this?

19:30.303 --> 19:32.273
I graduated from MIT,
and then I got

19:32.274 --> 19:34.346
into a horrible accident
where I lost half my brain.

19:34.347 --> 19:36.333
There it is.

19:56.275 --> 19:58.249
I came back
to say good-bye.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.277
I figured that.

20:01.334 --> 20:03.337
I was kidding myself.

20:03.838 --> 20:06.270
I love teaching.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.345
It's who I am.

20:09.346 --> 20:12.249
What if I
can't do anything else?

20:12.250 --> 20:14.249
Jess, come on.
I can't do anything,

20:14.250 --> 20:15.279
and look at me.

20:16.308 --> 20:19.270
I'm kind of fine,
you know?

20:19.271 --> 20:24.287
It's just that being
a teacher was all

20:24.288 --> 20:26.328
I ever, ever
wanted to do.

20:26.329 --> 20:29.337
It just,
it just sucks, you know?

20:29.338 --> 20:32.291
Yeah, life sucks!

20:34.258 --> 20:36.317
And then it gets better,
and then it sucks again.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.324
Yeah.

20:37.325 --> 20:39.249
And then,
and then it just...

20:39.250 --> 20:40.292
- Sucks.
- ...sucks.

20:42.329 --> 20:46.249
Nick.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.311
What?

20:48.312 --> 20:50.308
Will you be mean to
me one more time?

20:53.325 --> 20:54.828
Look sharp,
you dumb-ass!

20:54.829 --> 20:56.261
You look sharp!

20:56.262 --> 20:57.317
You're a terrible
shot girl!

20:59.250 --> 21:01.278
You got hoof hands
and a plywood ass, kid!

21:01.279 --> 21:03.345
You call that a shot girl
outfit, you dumb-ass?

21:03.346 --> 21:06.261
I got mixed up-- I thought
it was a cigarette girl.

21:09.262 --> 21:11.278
That is what happened.

21:11.279 --> 21:15.274
You look like
a cigarette girl.
