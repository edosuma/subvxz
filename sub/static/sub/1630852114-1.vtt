00:34.669 --> 00:36.804
Hello. My name is...

00:45.813 --> 00:46.781
Hi.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.557
Yeah.

01:01.763 --> 01:03.263
Hi. My name is...

01:26.821 --> 01:27.822
Ayar.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.535
No, no.

03:21.301 --> 03:22.837
No, she's related
to the old cleaning lady.

03:22.870 --> 03:25.540
She's a cousin or niece,
I don't know...

03:25.973 --> 03:28.776
Oh. No, I'm gonna make her
wear a mask and gloves.

03:28.810 --> 03:30.578
And she leaves
her clothes here after...

03:30.912 --> 03:32.747
He's fine. I mean, he actually,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.282
he made a ton of money
on some mask company.

03:35.717 --> 03:37.652
I know, it's so sad, but yeah.

03:38.820 --> 03:40.420
I should go. Yeah, okay,

03:40.454 --> 03:42.389
let's plan a play date
this weekend, okay?

03:42.422 --> 03:43.524
All right.

03:44.025 --> 03:45.727
I'm so sorry.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.327
I don't know where
my days get away from me now.

03:47.360 --> 03:48.696
- No problem.
- Sorry. Thanks for waiting.

03:56.070 --> 03:57.739
What is it?

03:57.772 --> 03:59.507
Sorry. Nothing. You're just...

03:59.540 --> 04:01.408
You're just so much younger
than I was expecting.

04:01.441 --> 04:02.810
How are you related

04:02.844 --> 04:04.444
- to Maria again?
- I'm not.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.980
She's my friend's mother.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.849
She told me
you just moved back from Vegas.

04:07.882 --> 04:09.684
Were you working at a hotel?

04:10.885 --> 04:12.687
I was working as a singer,

04:12.720 --> 04:14.387
but I came back
to be with my daughter.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.057
Your English
is really good.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.692
How long have you been here?

04:17.725 --> 04:19.259
Since I was thirteen.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.430
Well, the house is really big.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.868
Lots of rooms. Four bathrooms,
we only use two of them,

04:26.901 --> 04:28.870
so you have to clean
two every week.

04:29.704 --> 04:32.472
But we used to use
all the natural products,

04:32.507 --> 04:33.875
but they just honestly
don't get the job done,

04:33.908 --> 04:35.777
so now we just
use bleach on everything.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.913
We like the floors done,
the windows done weekly,

04:38.946 --> 04:41.015
laundry... you know?

04:41.516 --> 04:42.850
Sure. No problem.

04:42.884 --> 04:43.951
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:43.985 --> 04:45.052
Well.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.888
I can show you
where the supplies are,

04:46.921 --> 04:48.321
you can get started now.

04:48.623 --> 04:50.725
No, sorry. I can't start today.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.459
Oh, I thought we said today.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.861
No, we discussed Monday.

04:53.895 --> 04:56.531
We said on Monday.
I can start on Monday.

04:57.565 --> 04:58.900
Huh. Okay.

04:58.933 --> 05:00.701
Yeah, I guess that's fine.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.003
- Sure.
- All right.

05:02.036 --> 05:03.470
See you Monday.

05:21.856 --> 05:23.791
<i>Hey. How's L.A.?</i>

05:23.825 --> 05:25.526
<i>What do you want, Robert?</i>

05:25.860 --> 05:27.595
<i>I need to see you.</i>

05:27.628 --> 05:28.796
<i>When are you coming back, Ayar?</i>

05:29.063 --> 05:30.330
<i>I don't know.</i>

05:32.700 --> 05:34.569
<i>You're missing
some big auditions.</i>

05:35.970 --> 05:37.605
<i>I need to go.</i>

05:38.606 --> 05:39.674
<i>Please.</i>

05:40.440 --> 05:41.943
<i>I'm coming to see you.</i>

05:41.976 --> 05:43.878
<i>No.
Her birthday is today. Don't.</i>

05:44.879 --> 05:46.981
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

05:47.615 --> 05:48.783
<i>I have to go.</i>

06:02.797 --> 06:03.965
I'll be there soon.

06:05.066 --> 06:06.067
<i>Oh, yeah,
you must be so excited</i>

06:06.100 --> 06:08.903
<i>to see her.
How long has it been?</i>

06:10.071 --> 06:11.105
Long.

06:13.107 --> 06:14.642
Too long.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.382
<i>You're back now.</i>

06:23.551 --> 06:24.752
<i>That's what matters.</i>

06:27.121 --> 06:29.557
I just hope it's not too late.

06:41.936 --> 06:43.871
Hey you!
Get away from there!

06:43.905 --> 06:46.173
What did you do with that? Stop!

06:47.174 --> 06:48.743
- Hey!
- You motherfucker.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.044
- You stop!
- Got you, motherfucker.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.781
You motherfucker.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.182
You motherfucker.

06:58.719 --> 06:59.754
Fuck.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.977
Can you believe that my daughter
won't even come here anymore?

07:58.546 --> 08:01.549
She could go to the bar, but she
can't come and see her mom.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.726
Ayar?

08:20.001 --> 08:20.968
Ayar?

08:25.673 --> 08:27.274
Hey.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.211
Who you looking for?

08:30.244 --> 08:32.179
No. No, I think
I'm in the wrong place.

08:33.014 --> 08:34.081
You sure?

08:34.749 --> 08:36.050
All good, thanks.
Have a nice day.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.711
<i>Sit straight.</i>

09:06.047 --> 09:08.315
<i>Sit proud.</i>

09:12.620 --> 09:14.055
<i>Look at you.</i>

09:15.890 --> 09:17.191
<i>So beautiful.</i>

09:51.959 --> 09:52.960
Hello?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.798
I know you're in there.
I just saw you at the window.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.036
I can hear you coughing.
Are you okay?

10:03.037 --> 10:05.773
I'm fine.
Just leave me alone.

10:14.215 --> 10:15.382
Raj!

10:18.886 --> 10:19.787
Raj!

10:20.754 --> 10:22.957
What? I was telling a story.
What happened?

10:41.375 --> 10:43.310
Did you put a sick person
next to my room?

10:43.344 --> 10:45.112
- What?
- Did you put someone with COVID

10:45.146 --> 10:46.981
- next to me?
- She said they had no symptoms

10:47.014 --> 10:48.149
- when they checked in.
- They said

10:48.182 --> 10:49.717
this wasn't a COVID motel.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.085
- It's not.
- Then why is the lady next door

10:51.118 --> 10:52.386
coughing her lungs out?

10:52.419 --> 10:53.988
She lied to me
when she checked in.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.690
By the time I'm back,
she'd better be

10:56.724 --> 10:58.225
far, far away from my room.

10:58.259 --> 11:00.861
- I will take care of it.
- Thanks. And please wear a mask.

11:00.895 --> 11:02.096
Will do.

11:03.197 --> 11:04.899
- Excuse me.
- Sorry, Ayar.

11:06.967 --> 11:08.135
Foster?

11:08.169 --> 11:09.370
Are you gonna move?

11:11.438 --> 11:12.773
Six feet!

11:12.806 --> 11:13.841
- Seriously?
- Yeah!

11:13.874 --> 11:15.342
That's a fancy top.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.212
- What's the occasion?
- None of your business.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.915
Why do I sense
you need someone to talk to?

11:20.948 --> 11:22.316
Hey, Raj!

11:22.750 --> 11:25.753
- You expecting some white dude?
- Hey!

11:25.786 --> 11:26.987
What was that earlier?

11:27.254 --> 11:28.322
With what?

11:28.355 --> 11:29.390
With the car.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.692
Uh, with that car?

11:31.892 --> 11:32.960
Uh-uh.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.129
I don't know. It's not my car.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.401
You should be wearing a mask!

11:41.068 --> 11:43.404
And you should mind
your fuckin' business.

11:49.410 --> 11:50.778
Shit.

11:53.480 --> 11:54.915
Shit.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.154
Okay.

12:20.908 --> 12:22.142
Julie.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.911
Oh. Finally.
Where have you been?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.279
I'm not late.

12:26.380 --> 12:27.748
What are you wearing?

12:28.849 --> 12:30.217
You hate it.

12:30.251 --> 12:31.852
No. You look pretty.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.521
You look like that girl in...

12:33.555 --> 12:35.856
- Oh!
- Go stand over there.

12:48.536 --> 12:49.903
Ta-daa!

12:49.937 --> 12:51.438
And I hope it's not stale.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.512
It's beautiful.

12:57.545 --> 12:59.446
Thank you. I love it.

13:00.281 --> 13:01.882
- Good.
- Thank you.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.251
It's time for you to finish it.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.086
What do you mean?

13:07.121 --> 13:08.789
Well, what do you
want to say to her?

13:22.336 --> 13:24.471
Please forgive me?

13:24.506 --> 13:26.240
What?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.375
I just think it's a little sad
for a birthday cake, no?

13:32.514 --> 13:34.048
- No, no, no, no!
- Let me cover it up.

13:34.081 --> 13:35.115
You're gonna ruin it.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.852
It looks great. It's perfect.

13:39.153 --> 13:40.487
It's just...

13:40.522 --> 13:42.056
- I'm so fucking nervous.
- Julie!

13:47.261 --> 13:48.395
What if she hates me?

13:49.664 --> 13:52.199
Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know,

13:52.567 --> 13:54.435
- just be honest with her.
- Julie! Now!

13:55.269 --> 13:56.904
Tell them to fucking wait!

13:59.507 --> 14:03.344
But now death
has come to our doorstep.

14:05.112 --> 14:07.515
You never listened before,

14:08.015 --> 14:09.983
so now you must be shown.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.487
Forget "when"
and ask yourself "what."

14:14.088 --> 14:15.422
Leave me alone, please.

14:15.456 --> 14:18.492
Oh this complicated,
distracting world,

14:18.526 --> 14:22.930
this man-made world
has led you astray.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.099
I asked you to leave me alone.

14:25.132 --> 14:26.900
You see, don't you?

14:27.334 --> 14:29.970
These selfish, deceitful dreams,

14:30.003 --> 14:34.576
these distracting storylines
made up by others.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.377
Leave me alone.

Jasmina?

15:37.672 --> 15:38.673
Come.

15:44.178 --> 15:45.647
Come here, sweetie.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.662
And you will have
the biggest party ever.

16:00.695 --> 16:03.263
What if I don't have
any friends by then?

17:16.838 --> 17:19.039
What the fuck?

17:43.430 --> 17:45.098
Is that Ayar?

18:13.828 --> 18:14.829
Where is she?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.497
Please. Don't do this.
Not today.

18:17.865 --> 18:19.132
What?

18:19.166 --> 18:20.768
I've canceled the party, Ayar.

18:23.337 --> 18:25.138
What are they
doing here, then, huh?

18:26.440 --> 18:28.175
It's not your decision.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.376
Let me in.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.678
- What...
- You're not coming in.

18:44.391 --> 18:45.727
Let me see her.

18:45.760 --> 18:47.260
I just wanna see her.

18:52.567 --> 18:55.268
That's my daughter.
She's still my daughter.

19:01.743 --> 19:03.210
What did you tell her?

19:16.791 --> 19:18.760
Jasmine!

19:18.793 --> 19:20.193
Jasmine!

19:20.862 --> 19:22.429
- Jasmine!
- Stop doing this!

19:22.462 --> 19:23.463
- Stop!
- Jasmine!

19:23.497 --> 19:24.498
You stop it! You stop it!

19:29.469 --> 19:30.705
I've been back for two weeks.

19:30.738 --> 19:31.939
Two weeks,
and I haven't seen her.

19:31.973 --> 19:32.907
- Two weeks?
- Yes.

19:32.940 --> 19:34.174
- Two?
- Yes.

19:38.613 --> 19:40.347
Why are you
doing this to me, mom?

19:42.349 --> 19:43.350
Mom?

19:51.993 --> 19:53.561
You wanted me to.

19:53.594 --> 19:54.762
You said you wanted
to take care of her.

20:07.041 --> 20:08.943
What do you really want, Ayar?

20:09.977 --> 20:11.278
Why now?

20:20.588 --> 20:22.322
I just wanted to see her.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.775
I'm not a bad person.

20:40.808 --> 20:42.744
But you're a stranger to her.

20:44.912 --> 20:46.614
This will take time.

20:47.715 --> 20:49.282
And you must learn.

20:52.687 --> 20:54.454
From who? From you?

20:56.524 --> 20:57.525
From her.

21:09.570 --> 21:10.470
Here.

21:10.872 --> 21:12.272
Just give her this.

21:13.708 --> 21:15.710
Just give her this. Please.

22:38.059 --> 22:41.095
]

23:18.666 --> 23:20.167
Did you have a nice day?

23:22.236 --> 23:23.838
Who was that today?

24:19.994 --> 24:21.162
But your mother,

24:22.697 --> 24:24.732
she remembered everything.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.636
She answered all the questions.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.075
Sit straight, please.

24:38.679 --> 24:40.014
Sit straight.

24:40.548 --> 24:41.582
Why?

24:42.850 --> 24:44.618
Now you look strong.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.688
So beautiful.

24:49.123 --> 24:51.826
Why didn't you let
Mommy come in today?

25:03.571 --> 25:05.673
From where
our ancestors come from.

25:05.973 --> 25:06.941
Where is it?

25:07.308 --> 25:09.276
Now we call it Cuzco.

25:17.218 --> 25:20.087
Now in the highest
mountains of all...

25:31.665 --> 25:33.834
...where the most supreme god

25:33.868 --> 25:35.936
gave birth to four sons.

25:36.704 --> 25:37.972
Why?

25:40.207 --> 25:42.276
You can decide
how much of it's true.

25:42.843 --> 25:43.844
Okay.

25:44.178 --> 25:46.881
Now listen, the gods

25:46.914 --> 25:50.117
bestowed them
with a golden stick...

25:59.093 --> 26:00.861
He was so strong.

26:09.270 --> 26:11.705
...and buried him in stone.

26:18.312 --> 26:22.716
...and they encountered
a stone deity.

26:28.889 --> 26:31.659
...except one brother.

26:32.693 --> 26:35.663
He wanted to show
he was the strongest

26:35.696 --> 26:37.331
by defying it,

26:37.364 --> 26:39.066
and when he touched it,

26:39.934 --> 26:42.203
he turned to stone.

26:43.804 --> 26:46.006
Now there was the third brother.

26:55.783 --> 26:59.320
But when he thought
he'd found the perfect land,

27:00.387 --> 27:04.191
he turned to stone.

27:05.726 --> 27:07.928
Now, there was one brother left.

27:15.436 --> 27:17.204
...continued on their path.

27:17.238 --> 27:19.974
And when they
finally arrived in Cuzco,

27:20.441 --> 27:24.311
he sunk the golden stick
into the ground.

27:25.379 --> 27:26.847
His name was

27:27.781 --> 27:29.783
Ayar Manco.

27:30.184 --> 27:31.819
That's Mommy's name.

27:33.020 --> 27:34.021
Yes.

27:34.822 --> 27:36.957
So with his own hands...

27:40.461 --> 27:42.163
And when he was done,

27:42.897 --> 27:44.431
he turned to stone.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.703
And now rests with nature.

27:52.006 --> 27:53.007
Good night.

27:54.208 --> 27:57.178
They should have worked together
like a family's supposed to.

27:58.746 --> 27:59.880
Perhaps.

28:00.414 --> 28:03.017
Is Mommy gonna turn to stone?

28:03.784 --> 28:04.885
No.

28:05.219 --> 28:06.253
Don't worry.

28:06.754 --> 28:07.955
Is she sick?

28:08.289 --> 28:09.290
No.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.264
What if it doesn't pass?

28:19.433 --> 28:20.434
It will.

28:21.101 --> 28:22.703
How do you know?

28:54.001 --> 28:55.469
Like in the movies.

29:58.566 --> 30:03.237
Dear, you can be
anything you dream of.

30:04.539 --> 30:06.373
You can be anything.

30:09.544 --> 30:13.013
<i>♪ I am here, here I am ♪</i>

30:13.047 --> 30:15.849
<i>♪ I remember my first love ♪</i>

30:15.883 --> 30:18.586
<i>♪ There's a new girl in town
So look out everyone ♪</i>

30:40.407 --> 30:43.077
Cadence isn't
just about your voice.

30:43.110 --> 30:44.178
It's about movement.

30:49.149 --> 30:50.884
Do you feel that pain?

30:51.452 --> 30:53.253
You can use that pain.

30:53.287 --> 30:54.556
You can build on it.

31:30.023 --> 31:31.024
Hey?

31:33.394 --> 31:34.428
Are you okay?

31:38.198 --> 31:40.000
Do you need any help?

31:48.710 --> 31:51.412
Hey!

32:05.192 --> 32:07.394
Raj!

32:11.064 --> 32:12.032
Raj!

32:19.373 --> 32:20.608
Raj!

32:29.751 --> 32:31.719
No, I was joking.

32:31.753 --> 32:34.488
Let me tell you a story,
when I was seventeen,

32:34.522 --> 32:36.724
about my grandma in Jaipur.

32:36.758 --> 32:38.992
Beautiful city in Rajastan,
you must visit.

32:39.561 --> 32:42.296
- I'm almost done.
- Oh, good.

32:42.597 --> 32:43.964
My grandma,

32:45.098 --> 32:46.768
bless her Hindi heart,

32:46.801 --> 32:48.368
she told me this

32:48.402 --> 32:50.738
the day before
I moved to America.

32:51.506 --> 32:54.676
She said one middle of the night

32:54.709 --> 32:56.443
she woke up

32:56.477 --> 32:58.145
and went straight to the kitchen

32:58.178 --> 33:01.181
and grabbed the longest knife
she could find,

33:01.215 --> 33:03.450
and walked back
to my grandfather's bed,

33:03.484 --> 33:06.320
and stood there
with the knife in her hands.

33:06.353 --> 33:07.689
She was sleepwalking?

33:07.722 --> 33:10.390
She stood there for entire hour,

33:10.424 --> 33:12.159
holding the knife
above his chest,

33:12.459 --> 33:15.162
and then
returned back to the kitchen

33:15.195 --> 33:17.064
and went back to sleep.

33:17.297 --> 33:18.298
He abused her.

33:18.332 --> 33:19.767
I'm sure.

33:19.801 --> 33:22.202
To Americans,
most Indian women are abused.

33:22.570 --> 33:26.306
She said every night
she would grab the knife

33:26.340 --> 33:29.309
and hold it above him
when he's asleep,

33:29.343 --> 33:32.346
and wait for gods to show
some sign to plunge

33:32.379 --> 33:33.648
the knife in his chest.

33:33.681 --> 33:35.115
Oh, shit.

33:35.148 --> 33:37.785
She looked at me
straight in the eyes

33:38.485 --> 33:41.154
and said, "Remember, Raj,

33:41.188 --> 33:43.591
one day,
you are going to get married,

33:43.625 --> 33:46.226
and you'll be sleeping
next to your own wife."

33:47.595 --> 33:49.396
You know,
the divorce rate in India

33:49.429 --> 33:51.098
- is less than one percent.
- Raj!

33:51.131 --> 33:52.667
- Much lower than the...-
- Raj!

33:52.700 --> 33:54.434
- Why is she still here?
- Someone always

33:54.468 --> 33:56.504
- interrupts my thoughts.
- She's still in her room!

33:56.538 --> 33:58.205
- Who?
- Who do you think?

33:58.238 --> 33:59.674
- The sick woman.
- No one is there. She's gone.

33:59.707 --> 34:01.709
- No one is there.
- She was just coughing.

34:02.242 --> 34:04.378
- What are you talkin' about?
- I just heard her.

34:04.612 --> 34:08.181
I helped to call an ambulance.
She was very sick.

34:08.650 --> 34:10.785
And I saw them load her up.

34:27.569 --> 34:28.836
She's all alone.

34:29.369 --> 34:30.705
Good that you told them.

34:31.673 --> 34:33.541
I swear, I just heard her.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.778
I wouldn't go in there.

34:41.583 --> 34:43.483
I'm gonna go grab a beer.
You want one?

34:51.593 --> 34:52.459
I'm so glad you came.

34:55.429 --> 34:57.699
London, New York,
our show's everywhere.

35:10.812 --> 35:12.446
So where you from?

35:14.649 --> 35:16.216
From Mexico.

35:16.249 --> 35:17.451
Mexico.

35:18.620 --> 35:20.387
How much longer you stayin'?

35:25.292 --> 35:26.561
Not long.

35:27.629 --> 35:29.229
Me neither.

35:30.531 --> 35:31.633
I thought you live here.

35:32.600 --> 35:34.267
Nah, I met Raj four years ago,

35:34.301 --> 35:36.738
traveling
from Delhi to Varanasi.

35:36.771 --> 35:39.373
I do work here once in a while
to help him out.

35:40.240 --> 35:41.441
Temporarily.

35:45.345 --> 35:47.147
You see, I have this condition.

35:47.782 --> 35:49.584
It's a rare condition.

35:50.918 --> 35:52.887
I can't stay
in one place too long.

35:53.453 --> 35:55.422
I have to keep moving
any way possible.

35:56.323 --> 35:57.558
Okay...

35:58.425 --> 35:59.727
If I stay in one place too long,

35:59.761 --> 36:02.295
then I.

36:02.329 --> 36:04.297
I sink back in, I get stuck.

36:05.600 --> 36:07.234
I used to work as an accountant.

36:07.267 --> 36:08.903
Had this nice
apartment downtown.

36:09.504 --> 36:11.371
I used to think this feeling
was normal at first,

36:11.405 --> 36:12.507
this feeling of

36:12.540 --> 36:14.509
my mind and body
bein' separated,

36:14.942 --> 36:16.376
as though I was...

36:17.578 --> 36:20.247
observing everything
through a plate of glass.

36:21.516 --> 36:23.350
You sound like an alien.

36:23.383 --> 36:24.484
Literally.

36:24.519 --> 36:25.586
Literally.

36:25.620 --> 36:26.854
It was like
I was like a little man

36:26.888 --> 36:28.656
that sat in back of my own head.

36:28.690 --> 36:31.626
I could see the inside
of my skull and everything.

36:32.660 --> 36:34.194
I could see out these

36:34.595 --> 36:36.263
two eye sockets,

36:37.464 --> 36:39.266
with controls,

36:40.535 --> 36:41.736
with controls that didn't work.

36:42.503 --> 36:43.738
Seriously?

36:44.005 --> 36:45.740
The first cases
of feeling unreal

36:45.773 --> 36:48.009
go back to French
otorhinolaryngologist

36:48.042 --> 36:51.546
Maurice Krishaber in 1873.

36:52.714 --> 36:54.247
Feeling unreal.

36:54.582 --> 36:58.385
It's called DPD:
depersonalization disorder.

37:00.353 --> 37:02.757
Depersonalization disorder?

37:03.024 --> 37:04.726
Someone gave it a name.

37:05.392 --> 37:06.594
Now you believe?

37:06.828 --> 37:08.029
Someone who came
before you said,

37:08.062 --> 37:09.564
do this, do that.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.632
Now you're believin'.

37:12.033 --> 37:13.266
I guess so.

37:13.868 --> 37:15.670
I ended up selling my apartment

37:15.703 --> 37:18.271
and all my shit, and I've
been traveling ever since.

37:19.941 --> 37:22.375
So you felt trapped
in a steady, well-paying job,

37:22.409 --> 37:24.946
and you decided to say,
fuck it, and become a gypsy.

37:24.979 --> 37:27.380
Yeah.

37:27.715 --> 37:30.383
- Basically.
- What a luxury.

37:32.086 --> 37:35.489
My dad worked a job he hated
until the day he died.

37:41.428 --> 37:43.598
Now they want us
all to stay in place.

37:45.566 --> 37:48.936
Don't you feel lonely,
traveling all the time?

37:55.342 --> 37:56.811
I miss my son.

37:58.112 --> 37:59.881
He's in college now.

38:01.549 --> 38:03.518
He barely talks to me.

38:06.621 --> 38:07.822
Why?

38:09.524 --> 38:11.391
'Cause that's what happens.

38:12.059 --> 38:13.594
People forget.

38:19.033 --> 38:22.003
I was working in Vegas
when everything shut down.

38:23.771 --> 38:25.573
What'd you do there?

38:28.509 --> 38:30.878
I got my first gig after college

38:30.912 --> 38:32.914
as a back-up singer in a show.

39:05.646 --> 39:07.447
My mom used to say,

39:09.116 --> 39:11.953
now you can be
anything you dream of, Ayar.

39:13.754 --> 39:15.422
You can be anything.

40:07.608 --> 40:10.578
How am I gonna be
anybody I wanna be now, huh?

40:16.217 --> 40:17.919
You can do anything.

40:18.853 --> 40:21.222
<i>♪ Oh, say, can... ♪</i>

40:23.658 --> 40:28.829
<i>♪ By the dawn's early light ♪</i>

40:31.866 --> 40:33.968
They never really
felt at home here.

40:34.268 --> 40:37.538
That's why my mom
always points to the past.

40:38.072 --> 40:39.740
Nothing wrong with that.

40:42.743 --> 40:45.046
I wanted to make
a life of my own.

40:46.047 --> 40:47.949
Make her proud.

40:48.783 --> 40:50.017
Did you?

40:51.619 --> 40:53.788
Did you make them proud?

41:06.934 --> 41:09.737
Viva Las Vegas!

42:04.959 --> 42:06.694
Maybe I made a mistake.

42:07.228 --> 42:08.929
Maybe you don't
have what it takes.

42:10.831 --> 42:11.932
I don't know.

42:14.335 --> 42:16.170
This role is made for you.

42:18.372 --> 42:21.075
I believe in you. Okay?

42:31.052 --> 42:34.055
A virus can only grow
if it has life.

42:35.790 --> 42:37.658
They have to infiltrate,

42:38.392 --> 42:40.561
take over and multiply.

42:42.863 --> 42:44.932
And it grows and multiplies

42:44.965 --> 42:47.868
until it consumes all life.

42:50.771 --> 42:53.741
Until it destroys
everything it needs to live.

42:56.077 --> 42:58.012
And then it dies with it.

43:00.147 --> 43:03.717
<i>♪ Speak until the life ♪</i>

43:14.061 --> 43:15.229
Hello?

43:33.013 --> 43:34.048
<i>Ayar.</i>

43:35.182 --> 43:36.217
<i>Ayar.</i>

44:09.383 --> 44:11.152
I didn't even go to his funeral

44:11.185 --> 44:12.987
because I had
a fucking audition.

44:18.092 --> 44:19.894
I made a lot of mistakes.

44:20.794 --> 44:22.396
And I didn't know.

44:24.431 --> 44:26.367
Why am I telling you all this?

44:27.134 --> 44:28.335
You're lucky.

44:28.936 --> 44:29.970
Some people

44:30.004 --> 44:31.438
avoid their feelings.

44:31.472 --> 44:33.407
They hide their feelings.
They avoid their pain.

44:33.440 --> 44:34.975
They're scared to love,

44:35.009 --> 44:36.443
so they hide
in their own little roles,

44:36.477 --> 44:38.879
whether it's TV shows,
books, games, movies.

44:38.913 --> 44:41.248
Maybe even this movie.
Look at 'em.

44:42.483 --> 44:44.051
Sittin' there.

44:44.351 --> 44:46.020
Feeling their emptiness,

44:46.053 --> 44:49.356
in this honest recreation
of someone else's life.

44:49.390 --> 44:51.125
- What?
- 'Cause we hope

44:51.158 --> 44:52.993
that they may sympathize
and understand what it's like.

44:53.027 --> 44:54.862
- What are you talking about?
- They love it.

44:54.895 --> 44:57.264
- I'm in the middle of what?
- Don't hide your pain now, Ayar.

44:57.464 --> 45:00.067
- What?
- Look, you have power.

45:00.334 --> 45:02.169
Learn from the past.

45:02.203 --> 45:04.205
You can say, fuck tomorrow,
you can say, fuck next week.

45:04.238 --> 45:06.807
You can say, fuck Christmas,
Valentine's Day.

45:06.840 --> 45:08.976
Fuck Thanksgiving,
fuck all that!

45:09.410 --> 45:11.312
Choose your own role today.

45:11.345 --> 45:14.048
That's what matters right now,
because this is still America,

45:14.081 --> 45:16.083
and in America,
you don't get what you want

45:16.116 --> 45:18.185
unless you fucking take it.

46:14.074 --> 46:16.377
Mother!

46:22.216 --> 46:24.451
Oh, here you are.
So what's the scoop?

46:24.485 --> 46:26.954
What the fuck have you
done to the place?

46:26.987 --> 46:28.422
You look fucking ridiculous.

46:28.455 --> 46:30.024
Oh, really?

46:30.057 --> 46:31.825
Yeah. Yeah,
this was your chance, Ayar.

46:34.295 --> 46:36.063
I did everything!

46:36.096 --> 46:42.936
[speaking

46:55.316 --> 46:56.450
Did you hear?

46:57.619 --> 47:00.120
All the shows are closing.
All the hotels are shutting.

47:02.990 --> 47:04.325
What's going on?

47:08.596 --> 47:09.897
I'm leaving.

47:10.964 --> 47:11.965
What?

47:13.033 --> 47:14.569
What are you talking about?

47:17.971 --> 47:19.440
I'm going home.

47:25.513 --> 47:26.947
For how long?

47:32.319 --> 47:33.521
I don't know.

47:37.124 --> 47:38.158
Let go.

47:40.060 --> 47:41.629
Why are you doing this?

47:51.438 --> 47:53.073
I have a daughter, Robert.

47:57.010 --> 47:58.345
I have a daughter.

48:02.684 --> 48:04.118
Oh, you're joking?

48:06.353 --> 48:07.522
Very funny.

48:08.489 --> 48:10.357
Funny, funny, funny girl.

48:14.562 --> 48:16.263
She's turning five.

48:19.166 --> 48:20.901
Why didn't you tell me?

48:26.974 --> 48:27.975
Wait.

48:28.676 --> 48:30.043
Ayar!

48:50.431 --> 48:52.065
Sit straight.

48:54.268 --> 48:55.469
Sit proud.

49:09.751 --> 49:11.051
I'm here.

49:14.455 --> 49:16.023
I am here now, aren't I?

49:16.056 --> 49:17.324
Please, try
to understand that.

49:17.357 --> 49:19.259
Let me see her.
I just wanna see her.

49:19.694 --> 49:21.295
What are you doing, Ayar?

49:21.328 --> 49:23.096
Just stop this.

49:23.430 --> 49:26.366
My name is Ariana Ron Pedrique,
I'm an actor.

49:27.635 --> 49:30.204
I was born and raised
in Caracas, Venezuela.

49:30.738 --> 49:33.040
Being beautiful,
it was a big thing.

49:33.273 --> 49:35.375
I remember being,
like, five years old,

49:35.409 --> 49:37.244
walking in my mom's high heels.

49:37.277 --> 49:40.280
You have to do like this,
and you have to walk like this.

49:41.415 --> 49:42.617
I was eleven

49:42.650 --> 49:45.520
the first time
I stood on a stage.

49:45.553 --> 49:47.789
Romeo! Romeo!
And then I started choking,

49:47.822 --> 49:50.625
and then everybody was like,
Stop! Ariana, what's going on?

49:50.658 --> 49:52.259
And I'm, I don't know
what's going on...

49:52.292 --> 49:54.361
They gave me a bunch of pages,
all of a sudden,

49:54.394 --> 49:57.397
I was Julietta,
just because I had long hair.

49:57.599 --> 50:00.033
I don't know, I think
I enjoyed being a character.

50:00.067 --> 50:04.171
Me, Ariana, the tiny...
like, skinny little girl.

50:04.204 --> 50:05.673
If I do all this,
I can look like

50:05.707 --> 50:08.510
a whole different person.
I thought it was magic.

50:11.546 --> 50:13.748
I started being a model.

50:13.781 --> 50:16.483
Venezuela's like, there's
one audition in one month,

50:16.518 --> 50:18.620
and that's
the audition that you have.

50:18.653 --> 50:21.756
Mom, somebody hired me,
like, I'm gonna earn money!

50:21.789 --> 50:23.591
I'm a model.

50:23.858 --> 50:25.693
I always looked at myself
in the mirror, and like,

50:25.727 --> 50:29.463
am I beautiful today?
Or no, I'm not beautiful, yet.

50:29.764 --> 50:31.431
I was 21 years old

50:31.465 --> 50:33.735
when I moved to Mexico City
to pursue acting.

50:33.768 --> 50:36.403
And then I moved to Los Angeles.

50:36.436 --> 50:38.205
I was coming to see

50:38.238 --> 50:40.340
the person who then
became my husband,

50:40.374 --> 50:41.776
and he was living here.

50:41.809 --> 50:44.144
He fueled my dream.
He was, like, why not?

50:44.177 --> 50:46.714
Why are you doing
this to me, Mom?

50:46.748 --> 50:48.081
Mom?

50:48.348 --> 50:50.350
You haven't
called me that in years.

50:50.384 --> 50:53.420
They were, like,
you need to be more Latina.

50:53.453 --> 50:55.155
Just cry. Just cry.

50:55.188 --> 50:56.658
I'm asking to cry.

50:56.691 --> 50:59.326
I'm gonna give you
a little thing in your ear.

50:59.359 --> 51:00.695
You can just repeat

51:00.728 --> 51:03.230
what the person
in the ear is telling you.

51:03.263 --> 51:04.699
You can feel
definitely like a puppet,

51:04.732 --> 51:06.601
this is what you have to wear,
and now this,

51:06.634 --> 51:08.302
and come here...

51:08.335 --> 51:10.605
So I knew that could be

51:10.638 --> 51:13.373
something that
killed my Ariana...

51:14.509 --> 51:18.111
When you just try to fake it,

51:18.412 --> 51:20.380
that's eventually gonna explode.

51:20.414 --> 51:22.115
Stop it! Stop it! Stop!

51:22.149 --> 51:24.886
Just a minute! Stop!
Please, please. Stop it!

52:20.908 --> 52:22.744
Ayar, please open up.

52:23.745 --> 52:26.246
Please open the door.

52:29.349 --> 52:30.852
Ayar.

52:36.758 --> 52:38.526
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

52:40.394 --> 52:41.461
What are you doing here?

52:42.362 --> 52:44.331
Please just stop this
and come back.

52:44.766 --> 52:46.266
You shouldn't have come.

52:47.835 --> 52:48.903
I love you, Ayar.

52:49.704 --> 52:52.472
You don't know
anything about love.

52:52.874 --> 52:54.241
Please.

52:54.676 --> 52:56.243
We can raise her together.

52:56.744 --> 52:57.745
We can be family.

52:58.513 --> 53:00.347
I'm never coming back, Robert.

53:02.617 --> 53:03.818
Goodbye.

53:04.284 --> 53:06.486
You don't mean that.
You don't mean that.

53:06.521 --> 53:07.822
Don't say something

53:07.855 --> 53:08.956
you're gonna regret.

53:08.990 --> 53:10.558
Let go!

53:10.591 --> 53:12.292
Come on! Look,
I know I've made mistakes.

53:12.325 --> 53:14.428
I know that. Please.

53:14.696 --> 53:16.531
- I'm sorry.
- Let go!

53:19.934 --> 53:22.335
Please, Ayar.

53:24.605 --> 53:26.339
You feel that pain?

53:27.041 --> 53:28.442
You can use that.

53:29.476 --> 53:31.512
You can build from that.

53:33.480 --> 53:35.482
You think
you can just go back?

53:36.818 --> 53:37.952
Wake up!

53:38.351 --> 53:39.921
You're ashamed
of who you really are.

53:39.954 --> 53:43.390
You're scared to admit
that you're a nobody! Admit it!

53:43.758 --> 53:45.425
You're gonna
be a nobody forever!

53:45.459 --> 53:46.493
Oh, no.

53:46.527 --> 53:47.762
People wanna see stars.

53:47.795 --> 53:49.630
The same people
over and over again.

53:49.664 --> 53:51.331
People don't care about you.

53:51.364 --> 53:52.700
Nobody's gonna watch this movie!

53:52.734 --> 53:55.335
Just shut up! And go away!

55:13.380 --> 55:14.749
My name is Vilma Vega.

55:15.049 --> 55:16.884
I was born in Lima, Peru.

55:17.384 --> 55:18.653
I have one brother.

55:19.053 --> 55:21.488
My mother never received
a formal education,

55:21.522 --> 55:23.858
and she worked
as a maid for years.

55:24.158 --> 55:26.060
I met my father
for the first time

55:26.093 --> 55:27.795
this year of 2020.

55:28.095 --> 55:30.731
My heritage is
indigenous Peruvian.

55:30.965 --> 55:34.802
Both of my parents
were raised speaking Quechua

55:34.836 --> 55:36.704
and later learned Spanish.

55:37.705 --> 55:40.141
I left for the United States
to Los Angeles

55:40.174 --> 55:42.910
when I was 15 years old,
with my boyfriend.

55:43.711 --> 55:44.979
I loved him.

55:46.247 --> 55:49.116
It was a world of possibilities
filled with hopes and dreams.

55:49.817 --> 55:51.786
I wanted to be an actress.

55:52.820 --> 55:54.088
And I got pregnant.

55:54.822 --> 55:56.824
And at the same time,
my boyfriend

55:56.858 --> 55:58.659
left me for another woman.

55:59.760 --> 56:02.495
My mother-in-law
took custody of my child,

56:03.764 --> 56:05.566
and I was all alone.

56:07.068 --> 56:08.870
But I got an education.

56:08.903 --> 56:10.571
I learned English.

56:10.605 --> 56:13.541
I got a four-year college degree
from U.C. Davis.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.944
And I got my citizenship
when I was 40 years old.

56:17.178 --> 56:20.882
It took just about
over twenty years.

56:22.482 --> 56:23.818
I worked several jobs.

56:23.851 --> 56:26.854
I worked as a bank teller,
babysitter,

56:27.555 --> 56:28.923
fast food worker,

56:28.956 --> 56:32.727
then sales,
then management and leadership.

56:33.861 --> 56:35.830
I missed my son every day.

56:40.201 --> 56:42.036
And I was finally
reunited with him

56:42.069 --> 56:43.838
when he was 15 years old.

56:44.205 --> 56:47.141
And last year, I took him
to a trip to Cuzco

56:47.909 --> 56:50.044
to show him where I was from.

56:52.847 --> 56:53.948
Two years ago,

56:54.949 --> 56:58.619
I decided that pursuing acting
wasn't too late.

57:05.860 --> 57:10.564
Vilma, when you were
apart from your son,

57:10.598 --> 57:12.934
did you ever
think to yourself, I'm not...

57:12.967 --> 57:16.469
maybe I'm just gonna
forget about him. Like...

57:16.504 --> 57:17.672
There was a time where...

57:17.705 --> 57:19.206
So, the... yes.

57:19.240 --> 57:21.509
You're after the success, right?

57:21.542 --> 57:24.812
It is to prove something,
to validate your absence,

57:24.845 --> 57:26.681
to validate you.

57:26.714 --> 57:28.616
The shame gets bigger,

57:28.649 --> 57:30.718
because that's what happens when
you don't put truth to the lie.

57:31.052 --> 57:33.921
You never know
for sure who you are.

57:33.955 --> 57:36.757
When I go into this hole,
or this rabbit hole,

57:36.791 --> 57:39.260
my mom played this character,
my dad played this character,

57:39.293 --> 57:40.528
my brother.

57:40.561 --> 57:41.929
Like, am I part of a movie?

57:41.963 --> 57:43.864
And I'm just a character, then,

57:43.898 --> 57:47.234
so if I am,
then what do I get to create?

57:47.268 --> 57:49.136
You know?

57:49.170 --> 57:52.807
I'm thinking of,
as, like, if I'm Ayar.

57:52.840 --> 57:54.141
But, yeah, she's a role.

57:54.175 --> 57:56.277
She's a movie.

57:56.310 --> 57:58.779
Right. It's probably
the real wake-up moment.

57:58.813 --> 58:02.783
Am I really in this world?

58:02.817 --> 58:05.052
That's like,
because, you know...

58:05.086 --> 58:06.687
Life is...

58:06.721 --> 58:08.856
Ayar.

58:08.889 --> 58:10.124
Ayar!

58:11.292 --> 58:12.893
Hello, my name is
Henry Foster Brown, I'm...-

58:12.927 --> 58:14.695
Caesar Hartman
for the role of...-

58:14.729 --> 58:16.831
Hi, I'm Simon Haycock.
I'm 6' 1".

58:18.199 --> 58:19.867
- It's me.
- And stood there

58:19.900 --> 58:21.268
with a knife in her hands...-

58:21.302 --> 58:24.071
As though I was
observing everything

58:24.105 --> 58:25.206
from a plate of glass.

58:26.807 --> 58:32.646
I am a middle-aged
gay, Jewish New Yorker.

58:32.680 --> 58:35.049
I am born in Tijuana, Mexico...-

58:35.082 --> 58:38.019
We are indigenous to this land
and to Mexico.

58:38.052 --> 58:39.887
My grandfather
grew up on a plantation...-

58:39.920 --> 58:42.957
First came to the United States
as a student.

58:42.990 --> 58:44.759
Through Ellis Island.

58:44.792 --> 58:46.293
To be with the love of my life.

58:46.327 --> 58:47.762
Through an arranged marriage.

58:47.795 --> 58:49.263
I started getting

58:49.296 --> 58:50.798
- a whole bunch of odd jobs.
- I've been married for

58:50.831 --> 58:52.666
- 33 years.
- I was an insurance agent.

58:52.700 --> 58:54.101
- Salesman, working call center.
- And we have two daughters.

58:54.135 --> 58:55.269
To travel with
the United States military.

58:55.302 --> 58:57.872
I was a model in Milan, Italy.

58:57.905 --> 58:59.040
- And then I married.
- I was a lead singer

58:59.073 --> 59:00.641
in a rock band

59:00.674 --> 59:01.942
- alongside my office job.
- I personally

59:01.976 --> 59:03.144
- have worked as a dance teacher.
- I did acting

59:03.177 --> 59:04.011
when I was one year old.

1:03:17.164 --> 1:03:18.198
Hello?

1:03:21.569 --> 1:03:22.570
Hello?

1:04:01.008 --> 1:04:02.409
What are you doing?

1:04:05.245 --> 1:04:06.313
Are you there?

1:04:08.415 --> 1:04:11.619
So, this is how it ends.

1:04:11.653 --> 1:04:12.853
Ayar...

1:04:14.955 --> 1:04:16.190
This is not you.

1:04:16.658 --> 1:04:17.925
You have no idea

1:04:18.526 --> 1:04:20.562
how much you mean to me.

1:04:21.395 --> 1:04:23.030
You'll find your way.

1:04:24.031 --> 1:04:26.266
And how brave

1:04:26.701 --> 1:04:32.072
I feel today, because
I was you, for a moment.

1:05:15.550 --> 1:05:16.551
Ayar.

1:05:17.752 --> 1:05:18.952
Ayar.

1:05:52.386 --> 1:05:53.555
Mom?

1:06:18.278 --> 1:06:19.379
Jasmina?

1:06:23.217 --> 1:06:24.384
What happened?

1:06:25.587 --> 1:06:27.187
Is everything okay?

1:06:32.226 --> 1:06:33.293
I...

1:06:35.395 --> 1:06:37.297
just had a dream.

1:06:40.467 --> 1:06:41.636
Are you sure?

1:06:53.280 --> 1:06:54.516
Good night.

1:07:00.387 --> 1:07:01.321
Okay.

1:07:01.723 --> 1:07:02.757
Good night.

1:07:25.279 --> 1:07:27.147
- Ow, ow.
- Jasmine.

1:07:27.180 --> 1:07:29.182
- Where are we going?
- Shh.

1:07:33.220 --> 1:07:35.489
Whoa. Let's go. Come here.

1:07:35.523 --> 1:07:36.724
Come here. Come here.

1:07:59.847 --> 1:08:00.848
Hey.

1:08:01.516 --> 1:08:02.449
Hey.

1:08:10.558 --> 1:08:13.260
You live here?

1:08:13.828 --> 1:08:15.429
It's temporary.

1:08:16.330 --> 1:08:17.632
Only temporary.

1:08:19.299 --> 1:08:20.635
Come. Sit.

1:08:26.741 --> 1:08:27.809
Here.

1:08:27.842 --> 1:08:30.110
I got this for your birthday.

1:08:37.518 --> 1:08:42.657
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:08:43.390 --> 1:08:48.462
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:08:49.196 --> 1:08:55.369
<i>♪ Happy birthday dear Jasmine ♪</i>

1:08:55.903 --> 1:09:00.742
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

1:09:03.645 --> 1:09:06.614
I'm tired. It's too late
to eat cake.

1:09:09.851 --> 1:09:11.151
Okay.

1:09:14.321 --> 1:09:15.489
You can sleep.

1:09:16.456 --> 1:09:17.491
You are safe here.

1:09:17.525 --> 1:09:19.292
Come. You can sleep here.

1:09:19.761 --> 1:09:21.395
Come. Come.

1:09:24.999 --> 1:09:26.534
There you go.

1:09:27.702 --> 1:09:29.503
There you go.

1:09:30.905 --> 1:09:32.172
Hey.

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:41.883
I need you to know something.

1:09:47.822 --> 1:09:49.891
I need you to know I'm sorry.

1:09:53.460 --> 1:09:55.395
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

1:09:56.531 --> 1:09:59.232
But I'm gonna be
here for you now, okay?

1:10:13.681 --> 1:10:16.316
I thought I could become a star.

1:10:19.419 --> 1:10:21.354
Someone you would look up to.

1:10:28.495 --> 1:10:29.964
But I was so ashamed.

1:10:36.637 --> 1:10:38.405
Ashamed of myself.

1:10:46.714 --> 1:10:49.550
People talk about love
like it's this...

1:10:52.587 --> 1:10:55.790
great, beautiful, warm thing.

1:11:00.094 --> 1:11:01.796
But love is hard.

1:11:03.731 --> 1:11:05.499
Filled with worry.

1:11:06.934 --> 1:11:08.335
And work.

1:11:12.439 --> 1:11:13.708
And somehow you end up

1:11:13.908 --> 1:11:16.476
hurting those
you love the most, because...

1:11:31.358 --> 1:11:33.360
I just want you to know

1:11:33.393 --> 1:11:34.796
that I love you

1:11:36.030 --> 1:11:37.865
with all my heart.

1:11:39.432 --> 1:11:44.304
And I'm so sorry
it took me so long to learn...

1:11:47.942 --> 1:11:50.377
to see what that really means.

1:12:44.999 --> 1:12:46.601
Hey.

1:12:49.670 --> 1:12:51.371
Good morning.

1:13:07.822 --> 1:13:09.056
Do you like it?

1:13:49.230 --> 1:13:51.933
Come. Come, Jasmina.

1:14:08.282 --> 1:14:10.151
I miss you so much.

1:14:20.995 --> 1:14:22.530
We lost each other.

1:14:24.932 --> 1:14:26.634
I almost lost you, too.

1:14:46.554 --> 1:14:48.255
Oh, my darling.

1:14:52.727 --> 1:14:54.028
You don't have to cry.

1:14:55.162 --> 1:14:57.531
Oh, thank you.

1:14:58.699 --> 1:15:00.167
Thank you, I won't.
