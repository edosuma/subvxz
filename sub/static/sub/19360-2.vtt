08:55.965 --> 08:58.598
Why should this be viewed
as a civil rights issue?

08:58.637 --> 09:00.231
Because this issue of how we treat

09:00.256 --> 09:02.190
transgender people in our community,

09:02.215 --> 09:06.479
in particular, how we treat
transgender students in our schools

09:06.504 --> 09:09.839
relates to how our government

09:09.864 --> 09:11.714

09:15.436 --> 09:17.786
uh, accepting people for who they are,

09:17.822 --> 09:20.018
and when you see that
attempt to roll back

09:20.043 --> 09:22.558
that change, through the use of the law,

09:22.593 --> 09:25.293
that's exactly when the Department
of Justice has to step in.

09:25.329 --> 09:28.094
One of the main opposing
arguments is that...

09:28.119 --> 09:31.951
predators could go into,
let's say, a girls' bathroom,

09:31.976 --> 09:35.470
making parents feel that their
children's safety is at risk.

09:35.505 --> 09:36.804
What is your response to that?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.840
Of course we want to
protect our children

09:38.876 --> 09:41.801
from people who are gonna prey on
them, in a bathroom, in a school.

09:41.826 --> 09:44.787
But that's not the basis
for the violence that we see

09:44.812 --> 09:46.458

It's not coming from the

09:58.461 --> 10:01.262

10:01.297 --> 10:02.696
I think that it's more than bathrooms

10:02.731 --> 10:04.731

10:04.767 --> 10:07.768
Adolescence is hard for any child.

10:07.803 --> 10:09.703

comfortable and secure

10:12.942 --> 10:16.777

it adds an extra weight to it.

10:33.368 --> 10:35.241
<i>they're now forced to weigh the options</i>

10:35.266 --> 10:37.288
<i>of early medical intervention.</i>

10:37.365 --> 10:39.624
<i>Now kids, like
eight-year-old Max O'Brien,</i>

10:39.649 --> 10:41.667
<i>can delay the onset of puberty</i>

10:41.702 --> 10:44.337
<i>using drugs called "hormone blockers."</i>

10:44.372 --> 10:48.499
Max, when did you first
realize that you were a boy?

10:48.913 --> 10:51.710
I just thought I was
a boy my whole life.

10:51.746 --> 10:53.111
How many times did you ask your parents

10:53.147 --> 10:54.858
to get your hair cut
before you actually did?

10:54.883 --> 10:57.202
Like, I think like...

10:57.303 --> 10:59.903
- 245.
- (laughs softly)

11:00.087 --> 11:03.481
So, I got really excited,
and I went to Hounds,

11:03.506 --> 11:06.520
which is an only men's barbershop,

11:06.545 --> 11:09.604
and... cut my hair.

11:09.629 --> 11:11.930
How did things change
once you got your hair cut?

11:12.904 --> 11:14.703
My life changed,

11:14.794 --> 11:16.928
'cause I felt good in my skin.

11:17.104 --> 11:18.878
What are you gonna do tomorrow?

11:18.903 --> 11:21.873
I'm going to the doctor's to
see if I need hormone blockers.

11:21.908 --> 11:25.604
Max, why is it so important that
you get the hormone blockers?

11:25.931 --> 11:28.598
So I don't go through girls' puberty.

11:28.623 --> 11:30.768
I don't want that to happen.

11:31.733 --> 11:34.682
Toboni: Has Max started to
talk about puberty at all?

11:34.707 --> 11:37.833
He knows about puberty,
about female puberty.

11:37.858 --> 11:40.958
He started to have some
breast growth last year, um,

11:40.994 --> 11:43.053
and he, actually, was using Band-Aids

11:43.078 --> 11:45.306
to try to cover himself up.

11:46.026 --> 11:48.423
He's eight, you know.

11:48.448 --> 11:51.602
And, in general, how do you
feel about hormone blockers?

11:51.637 --> 11:55.239
Nervous about it a little
bit, just because I always...

11:55.446 --> 11:57.688
like to know a little bit more
about medical intervention,

11:57.713 --> 12:00.143
you know, and anytime
we're introducing chemicals

12:00.178 --> 12:02.579
into bodies that, you know,
weren't there naturally.

12:02.604 --> 12:05.148
I'm just, kind of, a
little bit worried about it.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.536
So, that's on my mind.

12:06.561 --> 12:08.986
Toboni: <i>Max goes to
Boston Children's Hospital</i>

12:09.021 --> 12:12.122
<i>which opened the first clinic
for transgender youth in the US.</i>

12:12.157 --> 12:14.515
- Woman: Max O'Brien?
- Toboni: <i>Since 2007,</i>

12:14.540 --> 12:17.293
<i>they've treated hundreds
of children and teens.</i>

12:17.329 --> 12:20.696
In the past couple years, our
volume has just about doubled.

12:20.732 --> 12:22.685
Toboni: <i>Dr. Jeremi
Carswell is the director</i>

12:22.710 --> 12:24.270
<i>of the gender program here.</i>

12:24.295 --> 12:25.835
What are hormone blockers?

12:25.870 --> 12:28.670
It's a hormone that will block

12:28.695 --> 12:31.007
the progression of puberty.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.654
We can give it in a
couple different forms.

12:32.679 --> 12:34.276
It's an implantable device,

12:34.311 --> 12:36.655
or it's an injection
and it's reversible.

12:36.680 --> 12:38.652
Max, I'm gonna have you hop on up here.

12:40.637 --> 12:42.084
Okay, just look at me.

12:42.119 --> 12:44.720
Toboni: <i>What are the downsides,
or what are the adverse effects</i>

12:44.756 --> 12:48.157
<i>of getting hormone blockers, when
you're, you know, say Max's age?</i>

12:48.192 --> 12:51.793
Carswell: <i>We have concerns,
about primarily, bone health,</i>

12:51.828 --> 12:54.396
because the sex steroids,
estrogen and testosterone,

12:54.432 --> 12:57.499
really do help build those
bones to be nice and strong.

12:57.535 --> 13:00.897
Another one is, really, kind
of the psychosocial development.

13:00.922 --> 13:02.504
Our brains are supposed to be ex...

13:02.540 --> 13:05.373
you know, exposed to
estrogen and testosterone.

13:05.408 --> 13:07.210
<i>You know, if you're not
getting your sex steroids,</i>

13:07.235 --> 13:08.342
<i>do you still go through that?</i>

13:08.378 --> 13:11.866
And how important is that
in gender identification?

13:11.901 --> 13:12.991
We don't know.

13:13.016 --> 13:14.673
That's it! You're done!

13:16.391 --> 13:19.237
I do think that puberty
has actually started.

13:19.262 --> 13:20.474
Um, the labs do show...

13:20.499 --> 13:21.956
- really early puberty.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

13:21.991 --> 13:23.924
I... I think we can move forward.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.026
- Okay.
- Do you want to see what it looks like?

13:26.957 --> 13:29.074
See this little thing? Okay?

13:29.099 --> 13:32.166
This is the Histrelin implant.

13:32.202 --> 13:34.981
Are you gonna put it
in my skin as a shot?

13:35.006 --> 13:37.337
It actually goes right about here.

13:37.372 --> 13:38.914
This is what it feels
like when it's inside.

13:38.939 --> 13:40.007
Okay.

13:40.042 --> 13:41.530
- Yeah.
- Ew!

13:42.211 --> 13:43.857
- So you will be...
- Well, this isn't real skin, right?

13:43.882 --> 13:45.713
Right. You won't be clammy like this.

13:45.748 --> 13:47.117
But do you feel how you
can feel it in there?

13:47.142 --> 13:48.640
Yeah, I can worry about you.

13:48.665 --> 13:50.155
Kimberly: So, while
he's on the blockers,

13:50.180 --> 13:52.847
he's not going to get
a lot taller, right?

13:52.872 --> 13:55.054
You will have catch-down growth, okay?

13:55.090 --> 13:56.823
"Catch-down," which
means that he will grow

13:56.858 --> 13:59.740
probably at a slower rate,
because we're taking away...

13:59.765 --> 14:01.453
Kimberly: The puberty
that's making growth happen.

14:01.478 --> 14:02.529
Exactly.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.890
If Max changes his mind at any point,

14:04.915 --> 14:07.460
um, we can release the blockade,

14:07.485 --> 14:10.837
and we know from lots of
papers, lots of experience,

14:10.872 --> 14:12.556
that he will go into puberty on his own.

14:12.581 --> 14:14.759
- On his...
- A female puberty.

14:14.784 --> 14:16.242
I always ask, every time,

14:16.277 --> 14:17.829
- "How are things feeling," you know.
- Yeah.

14:17.854 --> 14:20.056
It's important to keep
the space open, right?

14:20.081 --> 14:22.085
- Keep the door open. Yeah.
- And we do. Yeah.

14:22.110 --> 14:23.376
And he gets really annoyed with it.

14:23.401 --> 14:24.454
- 'Cause we keep on saying to him...
- Right!

14:24.479 --> 14:26.040
"You know, if you want
to change your mind,"

14:26.065 --> 14:27.531
- and he's like, "I'm not."
- Right.

14:27.556 --> 14:29.759
But we keep saying
it to him, so he knows

14:29.784 --> 14:32.290
that it doesn't matter to us.

14:33.345 --> 14:34.665
Toboni: <i>A month later,</i>

14:34.690 --> 14:37.024
<i>Max went to Boston Children's
Hospital at Waltham</i>

14:37.049 --> 14:39.024
<i>to have the blocker placed.</i>

14:39.733 --> 14:41.266
So, we'll get our consents.

14:41.291 --> 14:42.701
We'll get him right in.

14:42.736 --> 14:44.670
Max, just so you know,
this is gonna be very quick.

14:44.705 --> 14:46.772
- Are we doing it?
- Rachel: We're doing it!

14:46.807 --> 14:49.094
- Green light.
- Are you ready to go for a ride?

14:52.179 --> 14:53.244
(Max laughing)

14:53.280 --> 14:55.147
This is all you have to do.

14:55.182 --> 14:57.016
You can give him a smooch.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.320
I'll see you in a couple minutes, bud.

15:00.520 --> 15:03.719
Diamond: So, what we're gonna
do is put a Supprelin implant

15:03.744 --> 15:05.490
in Max's left arm.

15:05.525 --> 15:08.703
Typically, these implants are functional

15:08.728 --> 15:11.596
for between 14 and 18 months.

15:11.631 --> 15:14.267
Uh, given his age,

15:14.292 --> 15:16.352
he's likely to need...

15:16.377 --> 15:19.103
the implant replaced at some point.

15:19.138 --> 15:22.508
Okay, so we put the implant
into this introducer,

15:22.533 --> 15:25.389
and, uh, we just slip it right in.

15:25.905 --> 15:30.347
That was so quick. The whole
thing took 10, maybe 15 minutes.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.820
Toboni: <i>Now that Max
has the hormone blocker,</i>

15:36.855 --> 15:39.948
<i>his parents are weighing the
consequences of the next step:</i>

15:39.973 --> 15:42.011
<i>Cross-sex hormone therapy.</i>

15:42.036 --> 15:45.206
Does it make you nervous to consider

15:45.231 --> 15:46.796
cross hormone therapy for your child?

15:46.832 --> 15:49.494
Rachel: To me, blockers is,
again, it's not a permanent thing.

15:49.519 --> 15:51.701
- Right.
- It just puts a pause for a while.

15:51.737 --> 15:53.369
But the cross hormones,

15:53.404 --> 15:55.221
I'm glad we have a ways to go,

15:55.246 --> 15:57.006
before we have to start
going down that road

15:57.042 --> 16:00.797
because that brings on a
whole other slew of questions

16:00.822 --> 16:04.619
about fertility and about all
these different things that,

16:04.644 --> 16:07.119
I think, are really impossible to decide

16:07.144 --> 16:09.659
when you're 11 or 12 or 13.

16:09.684 --> 16:10.776
At some point,

16:10.801 --> 16:12.622
- you'll have to make that decision.
- Rachel: At some point.

16:12.657 --> 16:14.156
- And he'll still be a child.
- Yep.

16:14.191 --> 16:15.991
- How will you make that decision?
- I have no idea.

16:16.026 --> 16:18.815
I don't know. I don't know.

16:19.430 --> 16:21.997
Toboni: <i>It's a difficult decision
because the changes that come</i>

16:22.032 --> 16:24.666
<i>with cross-sex hormones
can be irreversible.</i>

16:24.701 --> 16:28.471
<i>And while clinical guidelines
recommend them for teens 16 and older,</i>

16:28.496 --> 16:31.322
<i>many doctors are starting even earlier.</i>

16:31.541 --> 16:33.893
<i>At 15 years old,
Steviee is getting ready</i>

16:33.918 --> 16:35.844
<i>to start on testosterone.</i>

16:35.880 --> 16:38.079
First year in high school,
so that's a little weird.

16:38.114 --> 16:40.652
Then getting used to everything,
trying not to get lost.

16:40.715 --> 16:43.082
It's not like the movies. You don't
get shoved in lockers or anything.

16:43.115 --> 16:44.852
It's pretty, you know,

16:44.888 --> 16:48.156
if you fade in the background a
little bit, nobody really notices you,

16:48.191 --> 16:50.512
so it's like easier to
get through your day.

16:50.537 --> 16:52.761
So, let me guess,
this is Steviee's side?

16:52.796 --> 16:54.410
(both laughing)

16:55.730 --> 16:57.371
Toboni: <i>Steviee and his
twin sister, Hailey,</i>

16:57.396 --> 16:58.980
<i>have lived with their grandfather, Rich,</i>

16:59.005 --> 17:01.121
<i>since their mother passed away.</i>

17:01.404 --> 17:03.164
Did your mom know what
you were going through?

17:03.189 --> 17:04.532
Um, yeah.

17:04.558 --> 17:06.450
She was the one who helped a lot, and,

17:06.474 --> 17:07.518
you know, when I was younger,

17:07.542 --> 17:08.571
- it really helped me.
- Hailey: She was very supportive.

17:08.597 --> 17:10.665
She was the one who bought,
you know, guy clothes,

17:10.690 --> 17:11.888
and my whole family was like,

17:11.914 --> 17:13.814
"No, they're twins. We're
gonna dress them the same.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.650
"They're two little girls,"
but my mom, like, knew.

17:17.858 --> 17:19.392
Toboni: <i>Tomorrow, Steviee is going in</i>

17:19.416 --> 17:21.650
<i>for his first shot of testosterone.</i>

17:21.675 --> 17:23.340
You're about to take a step tomorrow,

17:23.366 --> 17:25.169
starting on cross-hormone therapy,

17:25.194 --> 17:28.795
um, that will cause you to
experience irreversible changes.

17:28.831 --> 17:30.381
- Mm-hmm.
- How do you feel about that?

17:30.406 --> 17:32.958
Um, I know there's a lot
of people who are like,

17:32.983 --> 17:35.708
"You're a 15-year-old,
making adult choices."

17:35.733 --> 17:38.201
Like, "This is something that's gonna
effect you for the rest of your life."

17:38.226 --> 17:42.175
After a certain point, my voice
is forever, you know, changed.

17:42.211 --> 17:43.819
There's a possibility
that I could not, you know,

17:43.844 --> 17:46.712
bear children or have a child of my own.

17:46.881 --> 17:49.148
And, you know, those are
big things to think about,

17:49.183 --> 17:51.007
but at the same time, you
know, you have to think about,

17:51.032 --> 17:53.828
"Okay. What's the first step

17:53.853 --> 17:56.794
in liking the way you look,
and like, liking yourself?"

17:56.819 --> 18:00.062
Hailey: There you go, you can have
your own cooking show, Steviee.

18:00.171 --> 18:02.328
How are you guys all
feeling about tomorrow?

18:02.360 --> 18:04.225
Steviee: I'm probably gonna
wake up tomorrow, and like...

18:04.257 --> 18:06.755
Hailey: Freak... freak out, yeah.

18:07.093 --> 18:09.515
- Sounds like Steviee.
- Yeah.

18:10.163 --> 18:12.812
This is what he's been
wanting for years, so...

18:12.999 --> 18:14.669
it's what we're gonna do.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.675
What changes are you
most looking forward to?

18:16.710 --> 18:19.578
You know, like the more
stronger, sharper features.

18:19.613 --> 18:21.045
Like broad... broader shoulders,

18:21.081 --> 18:23.096
and more, like, narrow hips,

18:23.121 --> 18:24.765
gain muscle mass really quick.

18:24.790 --> 18:27.064
So, yeah, there's a lot of perks.

18:27.094 --> 18:30.446
♪ ♪

18:30.471 --> 18:31.923
(woman speaks)

18:32.936 --> 18:34.799
Woman: All right, come with me.

18:35.473 --> 18:38.830
You can have a seat up there, so I
can grab your blood pressure, okay?

18:43.997 --> 18:45.564
A little nervous?

18:49.343 --> 18:50.946
- Hey, how you doin'?
- Steviee: Hey, good.

18:50.971 --> 18:52.453
Good to see you again.

18:52.612 --> 18:55.813
I'm gonna go over all the
stuff about the medication.

18:55.848 --> 18:59.249
Hormones start several months
just at a really low dose.

18:59.285 --> 19:01.461
You know, you want it to
be kind of slow and steady,

19:01.486 --> 19:03.819
so you can adjust,
transitioning is a big deal.

19:03.844 --> 19:06.407
But if at any point, you feel like...

19:06.892 --> 19:09.375
this wasn't right, just say so.

19:09.795 --> 19:12.515
Anything else you want to talk
about before we go any further?

19:12.540 --> 19:15.375
- I'm just nervous as hell.
- Okay, understandable.

19:15.400 --> 19:17.634
I'm just worried about
what it's gonna be like

19:17.669 --> 19:20.003
- 10, 20 years down the road.
- Uh-huh.

19:20.039 --> 19:22.839
So, I can tell you
that from my trainings

19:22.874 --> 19:24.841
and from advocates in the community,

19:24.866 --> 19:27.756
a lot of people wish they could
have started at a young age,

19:27.781 --> 19:30.880
when the body wasn't a full adult body.

19:30.916 --> 19:32.782
I mean, if it wasn't for
the fact that I've seen

19:32.818 --> 19:34.751
- all of his life that...
- Right.

19:34.786 --> 19:36.276
He wants the boys toys,

19:36.301 --> 19:38.598
and the boys clothes and all that stuff.

19:38.623 --> 19:41.174
- He's told me numerous times.
- Right.

19:41.673 --> 19:43.907
- "Pappy, I'm a boy."
- Uh-huh, yeah.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.065
I said, "You're sure?"

19:45.090 --> 19:46.829
- "I'm sure, I'm a boy."
- Okay.

19:46.854 --> 19:49.604
So one thing we sort of
talked about in the beginning,

19:49.629 --> 19:52.063
- was fertility issues.
- Mm-hmm.

19:52.088 --> 19:54.229
You know, it's not the best thing,

19:54.254 --> 19:55.271
but, you know, I never really...

19:55.306 --> 19:57.506
it just wouldn't be natural
for me to have, you know,

19:57.541 --> 19:59.196
carry a kid of my own, so.

19:59.221 --> 20:01.577
Probably the best option,
do this rather than wait

20:01.612 --> 20:04.145
- until I have kids or something.
- Okay, okay.

20:04.389 --> 20:06.639
Toboni: <i>Steviee's sister and
all of his grandparents came in</i>

20:06.664 --> 20:10.389
<i>to support him as he got his
first shot of testosterone.</i>

20:10.764 --> 20:15.348
Your dose is .125,
you're at 25 milligrams.

20:15.373 --> 20:16.928
It says that on here.

20:16.953 --> 20:18.797
You're gonna be self-administering.

20:18.822 --> 20:20.751
The thighs are the easiest part,

20:20.776 --> 20:22.204
but if, today, you want me to,

20:22.229 --> 20:24.042
I can do it in the back of your arm,

20:24.067 --> 20:26.267
or I can do it in your thigh,
wherever you would like.

20:26.303 --> 20:28.610
- My arms.
- Back of your arm? Okay.

20:33.010 --> 20:34.670
All right, little pinch.

20:36.976 --> 20:38.467
We're done.

20:40.563 --> 20:42.228
I'm very proud of you.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.975
- How do you feel?
- Pretty good, I've waited a while,

20:46.000 --> 20:47.254
so, this is weird.

20:47.289 --> 20:48.975
(Grandfather Young speaking) -

20:51.560 --> 20:53.662
Grandfather Rich:
Paps gettin' emotional.

20:54.334 --> 20:56.959
Oh, and Grandma's gettin' emotional too.

20:57.374 --> 21:01.442
I've just always prayed that
they would find happiness.

21:01.467 --> 21:03.154
- Well, like you always said...
- And I think this is it.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.826
We know there was something,
but we didn't know what.

21:06.408 --> 21:09.231
If you weren't able to get
access to cross-hormone therapy,

21:09.256 --> 21:11.144
how would that make you feel?

21:11.225 --> 21:13.847
It'd be very, like, very difficult.

21:13.882 --> 21:15.495
Like I couldn't... there's
no words to describe

21:15.520 --> 21:17.659
how hard, you know, it is waking up,

21:17.684 --> 21:19.604
and not really connecting

21:19.629 --> 21:22.011
mentally with what you see physically.

21:22.057 --> 21:23.889
And I feel, like, to prolong...

21:23.925 --> 21:25.860
prolong the treatment
and the process for that

21:25.885 --> 21:28.555
would be, like dreadful.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.569
Toboni: <i>Many trans youth can't
transition until well into adulthood,</i>

21:32.594 --> 21:34.967
<i>because they don't have the
support of their families.</i>

21:34.992 --> 21:37.651
<i>Estimates show that about
40 percent of homeless youth</i>

21:37.676 --> 21:39.876
<i>identify as LGBT.</i>

21:40.565 --> 21:43.375
<i>Long-term residency programs,
like the Waltham House,</i>

21:43.410 --> 21:45.510
<i>provide a place for these teens to go.</i>

21:45.546 --> 21:50.345
The kids that we see come in here,
they're just in fragile states.

21:50.370 --> 21:52.050
Toboni: <i>Program director, Rebecca Reed,</i>

21:52.086 --> 21:54.186
<i>has worked here for over a decade.</i>

21:54.221 --> 21:56.388
You know, kids feeling...
feeling suicidal,

21:56.423 --> 21:59.357
um, kids making some
significant self-harm attempts,

21:59.384 --> 22:01.928
and it's heartbreaking to think that...

22:01.962 --> 22:04.196
somebody so young and so full of life

22:04.231 --> 22:08.066
can feel like there's
nothing to, kind of, live for.

22:08.101 --> 22:10.134
Can I have my estrogen, please?

22:10.169 --> 22:12.827
Toboni: <i>Charlotte came to
the Waltham House at age 16.</i>

22:12.852 --> 22:15.239
<i>After a lengthy legal
battle with her family,</i>

22:15.274 --> 22:17.163
<i>she is now able to take estrogen.</i>

22:17.188 --> 22:19.049
What was your childhood like?

22:19.074 --> 22:20.916
I was very lonely.

22:21.393 --> 22:24.582
I remember my father
yelling at me one time.

22:24.617 --> 22:27.704
I came downstairs in
my sister's black tutu,

22:27.729 --> 22:30.287
and he screamed at me to get
it off, that I wasn't a fag,

22:30.323 --> 22:32.423
and that his son wasn't gay.

22:32.458 --> 22:34.225
At fourteen years old,

22:34.260 --> 22:37.907
I told my mother that
I wanted to be a woman.

22:37.947 --> 22:40.231
And she looked at me, and she goes,

22:40.256 --> 22:42.047
"I'm gonna tell you this once...

22:42.082 --> 22:43.834
"I will kill you.

22:43.869 --> 22:47.004
"I brought you into this
world, and I can take you out."

22:47.090 --> 22:50.273
How did you feel when
your mom said that to you?

22:50.371 --> 22:53.076
Like I really had no
place in this world.

22:53.112 --> 22:55.952
I thought a lot about how
I was gonna kill myself.

22:56.048 --> 22:57.980
I only stopped thinking about that

22:58.016 --> 23:00.264
because I got hormone treatment.

23:00.352 --> 23:02.552
Toboni: <i>After years of
fighting for her transition,</i>

23:02.587 --> 23:05.908
<i>tomorrow, Charlotte is going
in for the next major step:</i>

23:05.933 --> 23:07.605
<i>Breast augmentation.</i>

23:07.630 --> 23:09.192
Toboni: <i>Are you nervous?</i>

23:09.227 --> 23:11.393
Charlotte: <i>A little nervous
'cause it's my first surgery,</i>

23:11.418 --> 23:13.020
but it's gonna make me feel

23:13.045 --> 23:16.223
a lot more confident
and secure in my body.

23:24.395 --> 23:25.895
Woman: So, what do
you like to be called?

23:25.920 --> 23:27.819
- Charlotte.
- Charlotte, okay.

23:27.844 --> 23:29.610
But tell me, though,

23:29.635 --> 23:31.246
your first and last government name.

23:31.282 --> 23:33.020
My legal name is
Charlotte Jane Michaels.

23:33.045 --> 23:34.244
Okay.

23:35.986 --> 23:38.787
Reed: <i>Charlotte and I have
had many conversations</i>

23:38.822 --> 23:40.622
<i>about her identity.</i>

23:40.929 --> 23:43.124
If somebody mis-genders
her, she constantly thinks,

23:43.160 --> 23:45.031
"Well, it's 'cause I don't pass."

23:45.056 --> 23:46.861
And so, going into surgery,

23:46.897 --> 23:49.502
<i>she thinks that this
will be just one more</i>

23:49.527 --> 23:51.894
<i>defining moment, to kind of, help her</i>

23:51.919 --> 23:56.424
<i>get to that Charlotte she
ultimately wants to become.</i>

23:57.540 --> 23:59.040
Toboni: <i>This generation of trans youth</i>

23:59.065 --> 24:01.318
<i>are some of the first
to transition medically</i>

24:01.343 --> 24:03.167
<i>before reaching adulthood.</i>

24:03.213 --> 24:05.313
<i>Because of that, doctors are concerned</i>

24:05.348 --> 24:08.816
<i>about the potentially unknown
long-term effects of treatment.</i>

24:08.851 --> 24:11.691
<i>Dr. Elizabeth Miller
co-founded the gender program</i>

24:11.716 --> 24:13.675
<i>at the Children's
Hospital of Pittsburgh.</i>

24:13.700 --> 24:17.758
Do you ever worry that kids will
grow up to regret their decision?

24:17.793 --> 24:20.764
I think that is absolutely...

24:20.789 --> 24:24.031
the largest concern that we have

24:24.056 --> 24:27.267
about doing anything that's
potentially irreversible.

24:27.302 --> 24:30.670
Someone in your position is criticized
from both ends at times, right?

24:30.706 --> 24:32.773
- Mm-hmm.
- You're not giving care fast enough.

24:32.798 --> 24:35.374
Or you're giving care that
people don't agree with,

24:35.409 --> 24:36.632
that's very controversial.

24:36.657 --> 24:39.930
It's part of the bargain, I
think, that we have committed to,

24:39.955 --> 24:43.750
recognizing that things
are not black and white.

24:43.785 --> 24:46.453
What we're trying to do is provide

24:46.488 --> 24:48.722
the treatment, the care, um,

24:48.757 --> 24:52.692
for young people, who, in
the absence of that care

24:52.728 --> 24:55.861
have a very high likelihood
of taking their lives.

24:55.893 --> 24:57.879
So, my sense is...

24:57.904 --> 25:00.406
cross-sex hormones, pubertal blockers,

25:00.434 --> 25:04.300
are absolutely medically necessary.

25:07.298 --> 25:09.808
Toboni: <i> For Charlotte, taking
estrogen has helped her</i>

25:09.843 --> 25:12.244
<i>to feel more comfortable
in her own skin.</i>

25:12.280 --> 25:15.281
<i>We caught up with her two
months after her breast surgery.</i>

25:15.316 --> 25:17.283
Charlotte: <i>I still look
like a trans woman, but...</i>

25:17.318 --> 25:20.161
<i>people have been treating
me a lot different now.</i>

25:20.186 --> 25:24.802
People have been using
female pronouns predominately.

25:25.259 --> 25:28.333
<i>If I had access to hormone treatment</i>

25:28.358 --> 25:30.528
<i>when I was younger, blockers,</i>

25:30.553 --> 25:33.431
I think it would have
made such a difference.

25:34.369 --> 25:36.503
I probably wouldn't have been this tall.

25:36.528 --> 25:39.684
I probably wouldn't
have been mannish at all.

25:39.821 --> 25:42.887
I would have looked a lot like a female.

25:46.039 --> 25:48.741
Toboni: <i>For Max's father,
Tom, starting on blockers</i>

25:48.766 --> 25:50.954
<i>isn't the only important step to take</i>

25:50.979 --> 25:52.983
<i>in embracing his son's transition.</i>

25:53.019 --> 25:54.891
Tom: <i>Here is this tattoo
that I figured I would get</i>

25:54.916 --> 25:57.049
<i>because it was never changing, and...</i>

25:57.074 --> 26:01.055
<i>now I have Max's old name on my leg.</i>

26:02.403 --> 26:04.523
<i>So, it... it dawned on me at some point,</i>

26:04.548 --> 26:07.267
<i>that that was something
that I needed to change.</i>

26:15.241 --> 26:17.797
Rachel (laughing): I think
he's coming. Oh my gosh!

26:17.822 --> 26:19.867
- Oh my gosh!
- (laughs)

26:19.892 --> 26:21.611
Rachel: How did he do that?

26:21.647 --> 26:24.514
You would never even
know it said Amelia on it.

26:24.550 --> 26:26.987
- Tom: What do you think, Max?
- It's awesome.

26:27.012 --> 26:28.485
Yeah.

26:28.520 --> 26:31.455
Max: I can't even remember
what it looked like before.

26:33.136 --> 26:35.347
What have been some of
the challenges or struggles

26:35.372 --> 26:37.593
that you've had through
Max's transition?

26:37.628 --> 26:40.763
The thing that's been hardest
for me has been the grief.

26:40.798 --> 26:45.415
I totally, a lot of times,
feel like... I lost a daughter.

26:45.440 --> 26:49.104
There was one day that we
were at the bus stop, and...

26:49.139 --> 26:52.140
Max had on really tight jeans,

26:52.176 --> 26:55.273
<i>and um, uh, a big puffy coat</i>

26:55.298 --> 26:57.510
<i>where the hood was up over his face,</i>

26:57.535 --> 26:59.087
<i>and I couldn't see his hair,</i>

26:59.112 --> 27:03.234
and it looked like Amelia,
and I just started crying like,

27:03.259 --> 27:06.021
"I don't get to see you anymore,
you know, you're right there."

27:06.056 --> 27:08.086
Just stay, like stay for a little bit.

27:08.111 --> 27:11.150
I just want to see you for a
little bit before you go away.

27:11.190 --> 27:13.065
I feel like it sounds really selfish,

27:13.090 --> 27:15.408
because I do still have my kid.

27:16.040 --> 27:18.207
The suicide rate in the trans community

27:18.232 --> 27:20.538
