01:00.325 --> 01:03.427
                 Gloria, I can't
                 get that locket

01:03.429 --> 01:05.129
                 out of my mind.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.065
Aw, stop worrying,              
Ma.                             

01:07.067 --> 01:09.333
People do lose things,          
you know.                       

01:09.335 --> 01:11.602
                I shouldn't have
                worn it today,  

01:11.604 --> 01:13.638
                but I wanted    
                to look my best.

01:13.640 --> 01:14.839
            I was serving tea   

01:14.841 --> 01:16.908
                  to the ladies 
                  at the church.

01:16.910 --> 01:20.779
You wouldn't think that anything
    bad could happen to you     

01:20.781 --> 01:23.514
  when you're doing something   
        religious.              

01:25.484 --> 01:28.252
 Ma, you're just going to have  
  to try and forget about it.   

01:28.254 --> 01:34.092
     I can't. Grandma gave      
me that locket on her deathbed. 

01:34.094 --> 01:37.395
She put it around my neck       
         and she said,          

01:37.397 --> 01:41.833
"Edith, I want you to wear      
this always to remember me by." 

01:41.835 --> 01:45.136
Those were her last words to me.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.572
        Those and,              
     "Don't marry Archie."      

01:51.376 --> 01:55.346
Gee, Ma, didn't anybody         
in your family like Daddy?      

01:55.348 --> 01:56.347
                    Oh, yeah.   

01:56.349 --> 01:57.348
Who?                            

01:57.350 --> 02:00.351
                      Me.       

02:00.353 --> 02:01.619
            Look at the time.   

02:01.621 --> 02:03.421
                 Archie will be 
                 here any minute

02:03.423 --> 02:06.357
                and I ain't even
                started dinner. 

02:06.359 --> 02:07.959
Oh, I'm taking care             
of that, Ma.                    

02:07.961 --> 02:09.393
We're having                    
Chinese food.                   

02:09.395 --> 02:11.495
          From the Twin Dragons?

02:11.497 --> 02:14.398
No, no, no. I found a recipe    
for chicken chow mein           

02:14.400 --> 02:15.533
in the newspaper.               

02:15.535 --> 02:16.868
See, you make it                
from leftovers.                 

02:16.870 --> 02:20.205
        But we ain't got        
      no leftover chicken.      

02:20.207 --> 02:22.741
      I know, so I'm using      
    corned beef hash.           

02:25.277 --> 02:26.845
 ARCHIE: Edith, where are you?  

02:26.847 --> 02:28.913
                    Is that you,
                    Archie?     

02:28.915 --> 02:32.583
     No. It's Marcus Welby      
      making a house call.      

02:36.622 --> 02:39.157
    I'm sorry, Archie.          
     I ain't myself today.      

02:39.159 --> 02:43.194
             That could be an   
             improvement, Edith.

02:43.196 --> 02:46.564
Archie, I got some              
terrible news for you.          

02:46.566 --> 02:48.900
            I got enough        
            of my own, Edith.   

02:48.902 --> 02:50.468
                 Somebody swiped
                 my lunch box   

02:50.470 --> 02:51.803
      on the subway today.      

02:51.805 --> 02:53.738
                 Somebody swiped
                 your lunch box?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.873
    Oh, look at this.           

02:54.875 --> 02:58.643
            Bad news            
      always brings more.       

02:58.645 --> 03:00.311
          Do you mind?          

03:00.313 --> 03:02.914
Oh, my, then you                
didn't have no lunch.           

03:02.916 --> 03:03.915
                      No.       

03:03.917 --> 03:05.216
        I went across the street

03:05.218 --> 03:07.718
          to Liebewitz's        
          Kosher Deli, you know.

03:07.720 --> 03:08.853
          But wouldn't you know,

03:08.855 --> 03:11.522
        it's some kind          
        of Jewish holiday today.

03:11.524 --> 03:15.994
        Just when you need a Jew
        the most, he's closed.  

03:15.996 --> 03:17.195
Dinner's ready!                 

03:17.197 --> 03:18.529
                    Oh, great,  
                    I'm starved.

03:18.531 --> 03:19.964
Let me tell you something,      
        Meathead.               

03:19.966 --> 03:23.434
        I'm going to eat you    
        under the table tonight.

03:25.704 --> 03:28.807
         Wait a minute.         
         wait a minute.         

03:28.809 --> 03:30.574
What do you call this here, huh?

03:30.576 --> 03:32.911
              Chicken chow mein.
              I made it myself. 

03:32.913 --> 03:35.346
  I don't see no chicken here.  

03:35.348 --> 03:37.481
That looks like corned beef hash
             to me.             

03:37.483 --> 03:38.850
                 Well, it is.   

03:38.852 --> 03:40.084
                We didn't have  
                any chicken.    

03:40.086 --> 03:42.453
      Well, what the hell       
is this other stuff here?       

03:42.455 --> 03:45.756
This looks like some kind       
      of burnt spaghetti.       

03:45.758 --> 03:46.791
                It is spaghetti.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.059
            We didn't have      
            any Chinese noodles.

03:53.999 --> 03:58.236
        What the hell is Chinese
        about this slop?        

03:58.238 --> 04:00.738
The name, Archie.               
Chow mein.                      

04:00.740 --> 04:03.808
                             Oh!

04:03.810 --> 04:05.776
    Come on, Daddy. Try it.     
    It's good for you.          

04:05.778 --> 04:07.712
    It's kind of tasty          
      and it's very light.      

04:07.714 --> 04:09.214
     Well, I'm glad to hear     
          it's light.           

04:09.216 --> 04:11.482
 Then it won't hurt nobody when 
  you throw it out the window.  

04:13.618 --> 04:15.686
          Edith, go out in      
          the kitchen, will you,

04:15.688 --> 04:17.588
and get me something I can eat. 

04:17.589 --> 04:20.558
    Get me my Cheerios          
or my Cocoa Puffs or something. 

04:23.795 --> 04:26.130
      Meantime, I'll watch      
old pinko Cronkite on the news. 

04:30.269 --> 04:31.635
         Wait a minute.         

04:31.637 --> 04:33.604
Where's the guts to my TV?      

04:38.510 --> 04:39.510
          Hey, Edith!           

04:39.512 --> 04:42.247
What's the matter,              
Archie?                         

04:42.249 --> 04:44.448
        Where's the guts        
        to my TV?               

04:44.450 --> 04:45.984
 Oh, they couldn't fix it here. 

04:45.986 --> 04:47.785
They had to take it to the shop.

04:47.787 --> 04:49.687
    They say it needs           
      a new picture tube.       

04:49.689 --> 04:52.390
    It's going to cost $75.     

04:52.392 --> 04:54.692
        Oh, Edith,              
I ain't got that kind of money. 

04:54.694 --> 04:57.896
      Gee, the whole world      
    is out to get me today.     

04:57.898 --> 04:59.364
        Me, too, Archie.        

04:59.366 --> 05:03.467
I lost Grandma's                
gold locket today.              

05:03.469 --> 05:06.938
  You got the nerve to mention  
     that old hunk of junk      

05:06.940 --> 05:10.341
  in the same breath as my TV?  

05:10.343 --> 05:13.577
Archie! That locket             
was worth a lot to me.          

05:13.579 --> 05:14.745
                     What worth?

05:14.747 --> 05:17.081
             An old piece of tin
             from the Civil War?

05:17.083 --> 05:19.050
It's old enough                 
to be an antique.               

05:19.052 --> 05:20.285
                             Ah!

05:20.287 --> 05:23.121
I wore it into Mr. Snider's     
jewelry shop last year          

05:23.123 --> 05:27.491
and he saw it and offered       
me $150 for it.                 

05:31.830 --> 05:34.098
$150? You never told me nothing 
          about that.           

05:34.100 --> 05:36.167
  It ain't the money, Archie.   

05:36.169 --> 05:39.070
 You know how I loved Grandma.  

05:39.072 --> 05:41.439
    Now I ain't got nothing     
      to remember her by.       

05:42.975 --> 05:46.777
  Oh-ho, maybe we can get you   
  something a whole lot better  

05:46.779 --> 05:48.112
      to remember her by.       

05:48.114 --> 05:49.513
    What do you mean?           

05:49.515 --> 05:54.319
    Listen, that homeowner's    
    insurance policy we got.    

05:54.321 --> 05:55.586
                That'll cover   
                that locket.    

05:55.588 --> 05:59.457
Oh, Archie, money can           
never replace that locket.      

05:59.459 --> 06:02.693
      Oh, money ain't gonna     
      replace the locket, Edith.

06:02.695 --> 06:06.931
     The locket will be replaced
     by a brand-new color TV.   

06:08.667 --> 06:10.601
What new color TV?              

06:10.603 --> 06:13.671
        The one we're gonna get,
        Edith, with the $300    

06:13.673 --> 06:16.174
the insurance company's gonna   
give you for that locket.       

06:16.176 --> 06:20.945
But Mr. Snider said the locket  
was only worth 150.             

06:20.947 --> 06:22.313
                 Ah, but, Edith,

06:22.315 --> 06:26.084
      you're forgetting your    
      sentimentual value, there.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.652
    That brings it up           
    another 150 bucks.          

06:28.654 --> 06:30.921
      Now, get the policy       
     and don't say no more.     

06:30.923 --> 06:34.625
But, Archie, I--                
             You're saying more.

06:34.627 --> 06:36.627
    Now, get the policy, huh?   

06:36.629 --> 06:39.998
      Ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha!       

06:40.000 --> 06:41.632
Well, it looks like today       

06:41.634 --> 06:45.370
      ain't gonna turn out      
    to be so bad after all.     

06:45.372 --> 06:47.472
        And I could eat         
      my Cocoa Puffs here       

06:47.474 --> 06:49.207
  if I had my milk and my bowl  

06:49.209 --> 06:52.276
      and my special spoon      
     from the World's Fair.     

06:52.278 --> 06:54.012
          I'll get it.          

06:56.415 --> 06:58.282
 Double-header today, huh, Arch?

06:58.284 --> 07:00.118
What do you mean by that?       

07:00.120 --> 07:02.487
     You're going to cheat      
 the insurance company and Ma.  

07:02.489 --> 07:07.558
    Why don't you mind          
     your own beeswax, huh?     

07:07.560 --> 07:10.628
      Here you are, Daddy.      

07:10.630 --> 07:12.497
            Well, wait a minute,
            wait a minute.      

07:12.499 --> 07:15.233
     That ain't my special spoon
     from the World's Fair.     

07:15.235 --> 07:16.434
What's the difference?          

07:16.436 --> 07:18.536
  There's a lot of difference,  
          little girl.          

07:18.538 --> 07:20.438
What's so special about a spoon?

07:20.440 --> 07:24.708
Because that spoon happens      
        to fit my mouth.        

07:28.647 --> 07:31.349
     The same way your foot     
        fits your mouth.        

07:34.586 --> 07:36.987
      Now, will you go get      
    the World's Fair spoon?     

07:36.989 --> 07:39.190
        All right,              
        but it's silly.         

07:39.192 --> 07:40.258
      You know something?       

07:40.260 --> 07:41.859
        I bet you               
that if I blindfolded you       

07:41.861 --> 07:43.061
    you couldn't tell           
      those spoons apart.       

07:43.063 --> 07:44.395
      You'd lose, wiseguy.      

07:44.397 --> 07:46.531
You want to put a quarter on it?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.332
                You want to lose
                a quarter?      

07:48.334 --> 07:50.368
        I'll put a quarter down.
Come on, put it up.             

07:50.370 --> 07:52.236
        You want a bet?         
        There, you got a bet.   

07:52.238 --> 07:53.438
All right. Gloria,              
blindfold your father.          

07:53.440 --> 07:54.472
                I don't need    
                no blindfold.   

07:54.474 --> 07:56.074
            I can just close    
            my eyes and tell.   

07:56.076 --> 07:57.241
        What's going on?        

07:57.243 --> 07:59.043
    I bet him he can't tell     
    the spoons apart.           

07:59.045 --> 08:01.312
      I got my eyes shut.       
Put the spoons in my hand.      

08:01.314 --> 08:02.380
        No, no, no, no.         

08:02.382 --> 08:03.781
         You'll be able         
    to tell the spoons          

08:03.783 --> 08:04.982
    by feeling the handles.     

08:04.984 --> 08:06.150
Gloria will                     
hold the spoons.                

08:06.152 --> 08:07.452
You feed him, Gloria.           

08:07.454 --> 08:08.652
                    Go ahead.   

08:08.654 --> 08:11.155
    All right, Daddy,           
you keep your eyes closed.      

08:11.157 --> 08:12.156
            I got 'em closed.   

08:12.158 --> 08:13.157
          No peeking.           

08:13.159 --> 08:15.293
                     No peeking.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.594
     Okay, open your mouth.     

08:16.596 --> 08:20.064
                             Ah.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.765
             Well?              

08:21.767 --> 08:23.234
                        Uh...   

08:23.236 --> 08:25.069
Hah! You can't tell             
the difference.                 

08:25.071 --> 08:26.437
             Wait a minute,     
             will you, Meathead?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.339
        Give me a chance with   
        the other one there.    

08:28.341 --> 08:31.175
                    Go ahead.   

08:31.177 --> 08:32.477
      Okay, Daddy, here's       
         the other one.         

08:35.514 --> 08:38.015
             Gloria! Don't force
             him to eat that    

08:38.017 --> 08:39.383
      if he don't want it.      

08:42.921 --> 08:43.921
                 That's the one!

08:43.923 --> 08:45.389
                I got it.       
                That's my spoon.

08:45.391 --> 08:46.690
         Pay me off the quarter.

08:46.692 --> 08:48.459
    Wrong! I've been holding    
    your World's Fair spoon     

08:48.461 --> 08:50.628
        the whole time.         
 You owe me a quarter. Pay up.  

09:00.339 --> 09:02.173
You ain't gonna get the quarter.

09:05.277 --> 09:06.877
        The bet is off.         

09:06.879 --> 09:09.647
          Because why?          
 Because you are a lousy crook. 

09:09.649 --> 09:11.616
             Now give me my     
             World's Fair spoon,

09:11.618 --> 09:13.384
          because you ain't even
          worthy to hold it.    

09:13.386 --> 09:14.385
    Here's the policy,          
            Archie.             

09:14.387 --> 09:15.819
                        Good.   

09:15.821 --> 09:18.722
Now, first thing Monday morning 
I'm gonna take this policy      

09:18.724 --> 09:20.724
        down to the guy         
      who sold it to me,        

09:20.726 --> 09:23.927
         Joe Peterson,          
an old VFW buddy of mine,       

09:23.929 --> 09:27.064
  and he's going to take care   
  of yours truly, personally.   

09:27.066 --> 09:29.233
Uh, I'm going                   
to have to ask you              

09:29.235 --> 09:30.968
a very important                
question, Arch,                 

09:30.970 --> 09:33.604
and be careful                  
how you answer.                 

09:33.606 --> 09:36.507
Was the locket lost             
or was it stolen?               

09:37.909 --> 09:39.343
                 Uh, what's     
                 the difference?

09:39.345 --> 09:40.578
300 bucks.                      

09:40.580 --> 09:41.579
                            Huh?

09:41.581 --> 09:42.946
According to your policy,       

09:42.948 --> 09:44.682
if the locket was stolen,       
         you're covered.        

09:44.684 --> 09:45.749
But if it                       
was lost...                     

09:45.751 --> 09:48.819
    Stolen, stolen, stolen.     

09:48.821 --> 09:50.120
That's lucky, Arch.             

09:50.122 --> 09:51.922
      For a minute there,       
I thought you'd said lost.      

09:51.924 --> 09:53.724
     No, that's just my way     
     of talking, you know?      

09:53.726 --> 09:56.126
Anytime an item gets stole      
from me, I always say it's lost.

09:56.128 --> 09:57.995
        It sounds nicer.        
 Yes.                           

10:00.299 --> 10:03.234
Agnes, make a note for me       
to call Ed Wagner               

10:03.236 --> 10:05.836
at Ben Franklin Mutual          
later.                          

10:05.838 --> 10:07.672
Wagner's an old buddy           
of mine.                        

10:07.674 --> 10:10.040
Any claim I send over           
to Wagner...                    

10:10.042 --> 10:13.844
          Hey, what else is     
          an old buddy for, huh?

10:13.846 --> 10:16.780
Okay, Arch, you want to give me 
the details for the record?     

10:16.782 --> 10:18.449
          Yeah, well, Edith     
          was out shopping, see.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.684
                 She was wearing
                 the locket     

10:19.686 --> 10:21.352
            then all of a sudden
            she looked down     

10:21.354 --> 10:22.786
        and there, hanging      
        from around her neck,   

10:22.788 --> 10:24.188
                  was no locket.

10:24.190 --> 10:27.425
Arch, that wouldn't cut no ice. 
It could've fallen off.         

10:27.427 --> 10:28.626
                No, no, it      
                didn't fall off.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.861
             It was stolen, Joe.
Yeah, I know it was stolen.     

10:30.863 --> 10:32.663
But I'm afraid we'll need       
a few more details.             

10:34.032 --> 10:35.099
          Like, uh...           

10:35.101 --> 10:38.636
          Like, uh...           
    who could've stolen it.     

10:38.638 --> 10:40.538
      Did she see anybody       
    suspicious nearby?          

10:42.574 --> 10:44.242
             Yeah.              

10:44.244 --> 10:46.377
          Yeah, I was           
just coming to that, Joe.       

10:46.379 --> 10:47.978
Good.                           
Go ahead.                       

10:47.980 --> 10:49.313
  Uh, just before it happened,  

10:49.315 --> 10:51.181
    Edith was looking           
    over her shoulder, see,     

10:51.183 --> 10:53.183
  and there, running like hell  
    around the corner,          

10:53.185 --> 10:54.418
  was the neighborhood mugger.  

11:00.692 --> 11:01.559
      Neighborhood mugger?      

11:03.027 --> 11:04.862
             Yeah.              
 Every neighborhood's got one.  

11:07.499 --> 11:08.899
  Did, uh, Edith describe him?  

11:08.901 --> 11:11.469
    No, uh, she don't           
    know him too good.          

11:14.573 --> 11:17.040
 You mean he ran away too fast  

11:17.042 --> 11:19.076
        before your wife        
    had a good look at him.     

11:19.078 --> 11:22.280
    You took the words          
     right out of my mouth.     

11:22.282 --> 11:24.282
And did you report              
this to the police?             

11:26.217 --> 11:28.419
                Uh... You got   
                to do that?     

11:28.421 --> 11:30.755
Yeah, if you want to collect.   

11:30.757 --> 11:31.955
                    Oh, jeez.   
You didn't do that?             

11:31.957 --> 11:33.758
You'd better go right down      
to the police station           

11:33.760 --> 11:34.958
and make it official.           

11:34.960 --> 11:36.761
        Guess I'd better go     
        right down to the police

11:36.763 --> 11:38.462
     and make it official, yeah.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.698
But don't go until              
you sign the form.              

11:40.700 --> 11:42.667
            Yeah. Oh, ain't that
            a shame, Joe?       

11:42.669 --> 11:44.302
            I thought I could   
            walk in here        

11:44.304 --> 11:45.703
                 and walk out   
                 with the check.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.305
Well, I'll get it               
to you Friday night             

11:47.307 --> 11:48.406
at the latest.                  

11:48.408 --> 11:50.007
I'll bring it over              
to the house personally.        

11:50.009 --> 11:51.074
                Oh, gee, Joe,   

11:51.076 --> 11:52.876
            that's awful nice   
            of you there.       

11:52.878 --> 11:55.112
By the way, uh,                 
tell Edith I'm sorry.           

11:55.114 --> 11:57.548
                     About what?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.016
About the locket.               

11:59.018 --> 12:01.018
            Oh, yeah,           
            about the locket.   

12:01.020 --> 12:03.253
          Oh, well, see, we look
          at it this way.       

12:03.255 --> 12:05.556
        Like we, uh, didn't     
        just lose a locket, see.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.492
                 We gained      
                 a new color TV.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.002
Well, let me get                
this straight, Ma.              

12:18.004 --> 12:19.303
The police found                
the locket?                     

12:19.305 --> 12:20.638
                        Yeah.   

12:20.640 --> 12:23.808
      Wasn't Archie smart,      
    reporting it, huh?          

12:26.544 --> 12:29.680
     Yeah, they made me go      
down to the police station      

12:29.682 --> 12:30.948
        and identify it.        

12:30.950 --> 12:32.216
      It was so exciting.       

12:32.218 --> 12:33.718
Well, where'd they find it?     

12:33.720 --> 12:36.887
        In a man's pocket.      

12:36.889 --> 12:38.022
Huh?                            

12:38.024 --> 12:41.191
        Yeah, the pocket        
  of a man called Red Delaney.  

12:41.193 --> 12:43.360
  He's the one that stole it.   

12:43.362 --> 12:46.597
     They took me in to see     
        the lineup, oh!         

12:46.599 --> 12:49.433
'Course, they didn't really need
      me to recognize him       

12:49.435 --> 12:53.037
    because they knew           
      who he was already.       

12:53.039 --> 12:55.439
  It was a lot like in <i>Mannix,</i>  

12:55.441 --> 12:58.609
         only the cops          
    wasn't as good-looking.     

13:00.278 --> 13:01.478
Where are you                   
going now, Ma?                  

13:01.480 --> 13:03.547
              Oh, I forgot to do
              the shopping,     

13:03.549 --> 13:04.782
            I was so excited.   

13:04.784 --> 13:06.416
                 It'll just take
                 me 15 minutes. 

13:06.418 --> 13:08.119
            I'll tell you all   
            about it later.     

13:08.121 --> 13:09.120
Okay, Ma.                       

13:09.122 --> 13:10.121
          Oh, Gloria!           

13:10.123 --> 13:11.122
                         Hi, Ma.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.858
Oh, Gloria,                     
ain't it wonderful?             

13:16.261 --> 13:18.029
            What's wonderful,   
            Michael?            

13:18.031 --> 13:19.797
Gloria,                         
what is wonderful               

13:19.799 --> 13:21.398
is that we have                 
the house                       

13:21.400 --> 13:24.101
all to ourselves                
for 15 minutes.                 

13:24.103 --> 13:25.770
Let's celebrate.                

13:25.772 --> 13:27.538
         Wait a minute, Michael.
         wait a minute.         

13:27.540 --> 13:29.173
                    What are we 
                    celebrating?

13:29.175 --> 13:30.841
They found Ma's locket.         

13:30.843 --> 13:32.409
                  Oh, fantastic.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.610
          Okay, let's celebrate.

13:33.612 --> 13:34.712
     Good.                      

13:34.714 --> 13:35.579
                  [DOOR OPENING]

13:37.348 --> 13:38.215
    Oh, look at this.           

13:39.951 --> 13:42.820
      Adam and Eve nipping      
 at the forbidden fruit again.  

13:47.125 --> 13:49.126
      Supposed to do that       
 behind closed doors, you know. 

13:49.128 --> 13:52.563
It was closed                   
until you opened it.            

13:52.565 --> 13:55.032
All right, fellas,              
bring it right in.              

13:55.034 --> 13:58.035
Right this way,                 
here we go.                     

13:58.037 --> 14:00.270
         GLORIA: Daddy,         
        what's going on?        

14:00.272 --> 14:03.040
I am taking delivery            
on a new TV set.                

14:03.042 --> 14:05.109
Put it right over there         
by the wall, fellas.            

14:05.111 --> 14:09.546
Feast your eyes                 
on 24 inches of living color.   

14:09.548 --> 14:11.448
              Right over there  
              by the plug, boys.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.717
                And hook it     
                up fast, huh?   

14:12.719 --> 14:13.751
                Because in about
                10 minutes      

14:13.753 --> 14:15.720
             I think a ball game
             is coming on.      

14:15.722 --> 14:17.621
Daddy, there's something        
I hate to tell--                

14:17.623 --> 14:19.256
      Let me enjoy myself.      

14:19.258 --> 14:21.458
 You know, there's about three  
 great moments in a man's life. 

14:21.460 --> 14:25.196
 When he buys a house and a car 
      and a new color TV.       

14:25.198 --> 14:26.663
That's what America's all about.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.266
                 Look, Arch, you
                 better listen. 

14:29.268 --> 14:30.267
        Leave me alone.         

14:30.269 --> 14:32.302
            There you go,       
            Mr. Bunker. All set.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.604
                Will you sign   
                here, please?   

14:33.606 --> 14:34.772
Oh, yeah.                       

14:34.774 --> 14:37.975
Just show me where to put       
my John Handcrock, here.        

14:40.045 --> 14:42.379
There. There you go.            

14:42.381 --> 14:45.482
And right here, I got           
your check for you.             

14:45.484 --> 14:46.683
                         Thanks.

14:46.685 --> 14:48.452
              You know this was 
              an extra delivery.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.420
             We squeezed you in 
             as sort of a favor,

14:50.422 --> 14:51.521
            know what I mean?   

14:51.523 --> 14:52.656
Oh, yeah, yeah,                 
sure, sure.                     

14:52.658 --> 14:53.657
Daddy.                          

14:53.659 --> 14:57.561
I'm busy, little girl.          

14:57.563 --> 15:03.100
Uh, here's a half a buck.       
Take care of your buddy.        

15:03.102 --> 15:05.302
     Look at this, Angelo.      

15:05.304 --> 15:07.638
A whole half a buck.            

15:07.640 --> 15:10.007
         Why don't you tell him 
         what he can do with it?

15:10.009 --> 15:12.910
I'd rather see him              
do it with the TV set.          

15:14.880 --> 15:17.648
            Oh, look at this.   

15:17.650 --> 15:20.550
             Ain't that a little
             beauty there?      

15:20.552 --> 15:21.819
                  Let me tell   
                  you something.

15:21.821 --> 15:23.387
                  I saved myself
                  120 bucks     

15:23.389 --> 15:24.989
            buying that right   
            off of the floor.   

15:24.991 --> 15:26.857
    Daddy, they found           
          Ma's locket.          

15:27.793 --> 15:28.993
             What?              

15:28.995 --> 15:30.661
That's what we've been          
trying to tell you.             

15:30.663 --> 15:32.263
        What do you mean        
    they found Mom's locket?    

15:32.265 --> 15:33.764
Arch, you can't accept          
the insurance check             

15:33.766 --> 15:34.765
to pay for this.                

15:34.767 --> 15:37.301
        I got to accept         
      the insurance check       

15:37.303 --> 15:39.503
    to cover the check          
I just gave them two guys.      

15:39.505 --> 15:41.338
             Daddy, you better  
             get that check back

15:41.340 --> 15:43.507
or it's going                   
to bounce.                      

15:43.509 --> 15:44.508
         Oh, holy jeez.         

15:44.510 --> 15:45.509
Hurry up.                       
            Get them!           

15:45.511 --> 15:46.510
                    Hey, fellas!
                    Hey, fellas!

15:46.512 --> 15:47.611
There goes                      
the truck.                      

15:47.613 --> 15:49.280
                Sure, that's    
                delivery men.   

15:49.282 --> 15:50.281
                  They're always
                  slow coming   

15:50.283 --> 15:51.481
            and fast leaving.   

15:51.483 --> 15:52.482
Let me call the bank.           

15:52.484 --> 15:54.285
Maybe I can put                 
a stopper on the check.         

15:54.287 --> 15:55.485
                 Arch, you can't
                 do that.       

15:55.487 --> 15:57.021
            You already accepted
            delivery on the TV. 

15:57.023 --> 15:58.555
            You can get in      
            trouble for that.   

15:58.557 --> 16:00.657
That's right.                   
Now what am I gonna do?         

16:00.659 --> 16:01.892
Get away from me,               
will you?                       

16:01.894 --> 16:03.127
                Let me think.   

16:03.129 --> 16:04.528
        Wait a minute, wait--   
        Where's your mother?    

16:04.530 --> 16:05.930
        Well, she's out         
    for a few minutes.          

16:05.932 --> 16:07.764
    Listen, if Joe Peterson     
    gets here with the check    

16:07.766 --> 16:09.266
 before your mother comes back, 

16:09.268 --> 16:11.668
 I don't have to tell him your  
  mother got the locket back.   

16:11.670 --> 16:13.337
              Yeah, but she did.

16:13.339 --> 16:15.172
  But she didn't tell me that.  

16:15.174 --> 16:16.740
Well, so what?                  
We told you.                    

16:16.742 --> 16:18.175
              You!              

16:18.177 --> 16:20.377
You told me you was going       
    to support my daughter.     

16:20.379 --> 16:23.047
 Why the hell should I believe  
    anything you say?           

16:25.851 --> 16:27.318
                Now, I'll handle
                this, see.      

16:27.320 --> 16:28.919
        Gloria, Gloria,         
        come on now. Come on.   

16:28.921 --> 16:29.920
                    Be a good   
                    little girl.

16:29.922 --> 16:31.255
     Do Daddy a favor, huh?     

16:31.257 --> 16:32.890
      Here, get your coat       
         and put it on.         

16:32.892 --> 16:34.091
    Now go out in the street    

16:34.093 --> 16:36.160
      and run up and down       
          there, see.           

16:36.162 --> 16:38.262
When you see your mother,       
    just head her off.          

16:38.264 --> 16:40.097
         Daddy, you won't let Ma
         in her own house       

16:40.099 --> 16:42.032
          because you know      
          she won't lie for you.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.800
        I don't want her        
         to lie for me.         

16:43.802 --> 16:45.236
        I just want her         
          to stay away          

16:45.238 --> 16:47.004
    and keep her mouth          
          shut for me.          

16:47.006 --> 16:48.239
Arch, it's                      
the same thing.                 

16:48.241 --> 16:51.075
    It ain't the same thing,    
        Meathead!               

16:51.077 --> 16:53.277
It's like the all-American      
      horse trading, see.       

16:53.279 --> 16:54.879
 A guy goes in to buy a horse.  

16:54.881 --> 16:56.680
          He don't ask          
    if it's blind in one eye    

16:56.682 --> 16:57.882
 and the owner don't tell him.  

16:57.884 --> 16:59.716
     See, that ain't lying,     
        that's business.        

16:59.718 --> 17:00.717
That's right, Arch,             
that's business,                

17:00.719 --> 17:02.119
and it starts                   
right at the top                

17:02.121 --> 17:04.654
with our own government         
feeding us lies.                

17:04.656 --> 17:06.423
    If your government          
        tells you a lie,        

17:06.425 --> 17:08.625
    it's for your own good.     

17:08.627 --> 17:10.627
    Like what I'm doing here    
     is for your own good.      

17:10.628 --> 17:11.661
        Leave me alone.         

17:11.663 --> 17:13.663
     Go on, do what I told      
        you to do, huh?         

17:13.665 --> 17:14.865
         I got to call          
         Joe Peterson.          

17:14.867 --> 17:16.665
        Daddy, what do you mean,
        "for our own good"?     

17:16.667 --> 17:19.002
      Was the ITT scandal       
    for our own good?           

17:19.005 --> 17:21.838
And what about the bugging      
of the Democratic headquarters? 

17:21.839 --> 17:24.275
 I'm worrying about saving a TV,

17:24.277 --> 17:26.742
  and they're screaming at me

Sure. What is it?               

21:33.259 --> 21:34.658
              Oh, it's just     
              a simple statement

21:34.660 --> 21:36.293
            saying that your    
            locket was stolen   

21:36.295 --> 21:38.028
            and you know nothing
            of its whereabouts. 

21:38.030 --> 21:39.129
Just sign                       
the statement, Edith,           

21:39.131 --> 21:41.931
and we get the check.           

21:41.933 --> 21:44.668
            But I do know       
            where the locket is.

 No!                            
                Yeah.           

21:53.744 --> 21:55.078
             The police have it.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.413
Aw, jeez.                       
                     The police?

21:56.415 --> 21:58.848
             Yeah,              
they're holding it for evidence 

21:58.850 --> 22:00.450
     till after the trial.      

22:00.452 --> 22:01.885
The trial of Red Delaney?       

22:01.887 --> 22:09.893
Yeah, the trial of Red Delaney. 
"The trial of Red Delaney."     

22:09.895 --> 22:14.064
Oh, that sounds just like       
a movie, don't it, Archie?      

22:14.066 --> 22:17.434
Look, we got a new TV set!      

22:21.306 --> 22:23.607
             Well, that is that.

22:23.609 --> 22:26.643
        I'm sure you must be    
        very happy, Mrs. Bunker.

22:26.645 --> 22:28.111
                    I know I am,

22:28.113 --> 22:31.715
              and the company   
              will be delighted.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.084
        Oh, I just love         
         happy endings,         

22:34.086 --> 22:35.819
    don't you, Archie?          

22:38.423 --> 22:41.525
        Now, you just call me   
        anytime you want me,    

22:41.527 --> 22:43.159
                and remember,   

22:43.161 --> 22:46.563
         Benjamin Franklin is   
         there when you need us.

22:46.565 --> 22:47.564
                        Goodbye.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.899
Goodbye, and thank you.         

22:56.006 --> 22:57.274
                         Archie,

22:57.276 --> 23:00.009
can I ask you                   
a question?                     

23:00.011 --> 23:03.146
                Of course you   
                may, Edith.     

23:03.148 --> 23:05.415
Did you really think            
I was lying?                    

23:05.417 --> 23:08.017
                      Oh, Edith.

23:08.019 --> 23:11.622
      I mean, with $300 waltzing
      out the door that way,    

23:11.624 --> 23:13.423
             do you really think
             I give a damn?     

23:18.062 --> 23:20.297
But I told                      
the truth, Archie.              

23:20.299 --> 23:22.832
That's always                   
the best thing to do.           

23:22.834 --> 23:24.200
Aw, the best thing to do.       

23:24.202 --> 23:26.002
Let me ask you a question,      
             Edith.             

23:26.004 --> 23:27.137
             Sure.              

23:27.139 --> 23:30.807
        How is it always        
  when you do the best thing,   

23:30.809 --> 23:32.542
    it turns out the worst?     

23:41.619 --> 23:42.719
Hurry up, Michael.              

23:42.721 --> 23:44.087
The documentary                 
you wanted to see               

23:44.089 --> 23:45.355
is on                           
in a few minutes.               

23:45.357 --> 23:46.657
    Hold it, hold it,           
          little girl.          

23:46.659 --> 23:48.692
          Give me that          
        remote control.         

23:48.694 --> 23:50.427
Documentary, my foot.           

23:50.429 --> 23:52.962
I'm 300 bucks in the hole       
over that television set.       

23:52.964 --> 23:54.765
      We're going to watch      
     what I want to watch,      

23:54.767 --> 23:56.500
which happens to be the fights. 

23:56.502 --> 23:57.567
                      Oh, Daddy.

23:57.569 --> 23:58.902
There.                          

24:03.775 --> 24:04.941
        Now what's this?        

24:04.943 --> 24:06.443
      It's supposed to be       
    instant on, here.           

24:06.445 --> 24:08.144
  See, is it plugged in there,  
        Meathead?               

24:08.146 --> 24:09.946
                        Yeah.   

24:09.948 --> 24:11.047
     Why don't it come on?      

24:12.717 --> 24:14.618
         There, there.          

24:14.620 --> 24:16.687
     Come on, get on there.     

24:18.423 --> 24:19.690
     It's a brand-new set.      

24:19.692 --> 24:21.358
     This thing's supposed      
     to work perfect, here.     

24:21.360 --> 24:22.526
Did you ask them                

24:22.528 --> 24:24.328
if the remote control           
was working?                    

24:24.330 --> 24:25.796
    You don't ask questions     
        like that               

24:25.798 --> 24:27.931
    about a brand-new piece     
         of equipment.          

24:27.933 --> 24:30.667
Arch, you bought a horse        
with a blind eye.               

24:33.638 --> 24:35.271
            Yeah, Daddy,        
            that's not lying.   

24:35.273 --> 24:37.207
                That's business.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.042
That's what America's           
all about.                      

24:39.044 --> 24:41.177
            ♪ Doo-dah, doo-dah ♪
