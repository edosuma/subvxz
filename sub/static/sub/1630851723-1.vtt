WEBVTT

00:01.269 --> 00:02.936
<i>Previously on
"The Blacklist"...</i>

00:03.071 --> 00:05.739
If you took over
for Reddington,
inherited the Blacklist...

00:05.873 --> 00:07.975
One task, then it's done.

00:08.109 --> 00:11.079
What could <i>possibly</i>
be left for me to do?

00:11.212 --> 00:13.081
To take my life.
I can't do it.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.550
It's all right.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.759
Raymond, we must.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.027
I'm sorry.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.629
How does it end?

00:29.797 --> 00:31.031
You'll find out.

00:42.343 --> 00:44.044
Her name is Elizabeth?

00:44.178 --> 00:46.380
Do you believe
in love at first sight?

00:46.514 --> 00:49.550
I didn't. Not until she
walked into that restaurant.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.052
I knew an Elizabeth.

00:52.186 --> 00:54.322
You know, I've only
known her for two weeks,

00:54.455 --> 00:57.425
but when you know, you know,
am I right?

00:57.558 --> 01:00.060
I never did,
but I'm glad you do.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.995
So, tell me about her.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.331
Your Elizabeth.

01:05.199 --> 01:07.501
She wasn't my Elizabeth.
She was my friend.

01:08.769 --> 01:10.404
She died two years ago.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.140
I'm sorry.

01:12.273 --> 01:13.641
Hey.

01:21.349 --> 01:22.516
The truck's loaded up.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.252
Wire the payment,
and you're good to go.

01:24.385 --> 01:26.520
Yeah, listen.
Uh, about that...

01:30.791 --> 01:32.126
The agreement was
you come alone.

01:32.260 --> 01:34.228
Agreements change.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.896
My associate's
a trusting fellow.

01:36.029 --> 01:37.565
He sees nothing
but possibility

01:37.698 --> 01:40.268
in stealing a truckload
of precious microchips,

01:40.401 --> 01:43.137
especially when one of the
eagerly corrupt port employees

01:43.271 --> 01:45.239
asks a lot of questions.

01:45.373 --> 01:47.875
So I asked some of my own.
He's a cop.

01:50.878 --> 01:52.546
What should I do
about that?

01:53.814 --> 01:55.048
Make sure
he's never found.

02:00.854 --> 02:03.557
Kill him. Go on.
Your partner's a cop.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.060
Show me
you're not one, too.

02:12.733 --> 02:14.802
See? I told you.
Nothing to worry about.

02:20.741 --> 02:22.576
Hmm. There's no blood.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.949
Like I said,
he's very trusting.

02:30.851 --> 02:32.119
Up.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.858
Ah. Looky here.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.695
Special Agent
Dembe Zuma.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.231
FBI.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.270
No, no!

02:51.939 --> 02:53.674
See what the FBI knows first,

02:53.807 --> 02:56.009
then kill him
and get rid of the bodies.

02:56.143 --> 02:57.845
You, get the truck. Go.

02:59.913 --> 03:01.382
There's a diamond ring
in his pocket.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.016
Oh, I'm through
trusting you.

03:03.150 --> 03:04.685
It's two carats
at least.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.630
Well, well.
What do you know?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.033
No! No, no, no!

04:06.714 --> 04:10.150
<i>A shootout at a Los Angeles
port left one FBI agent dead</i>

04:10.284 --> 04:12.753
<i>and another wounded,
raising fears about disruption</i>

04:12.886 --> 04:15.222
<i>in the supply
of vital microchips.</i>

04:15.356 --> 04:17.224
<i>With us to discuss
the incident is former</i>

04:17.358 --> 04:19.593
<i>FBI deputy director
Harold Cooper.</i>

04:19.727 --> 04:22.095
<i>So, what happened
and why?</i>

04:22.229 --> 04:24.898
<i>The "why" is simple.
The world runs on microchips.</i>

04:25.032 --> 04:28.869
<i>Our phones, our cars,
the planes we fly in.</i>

04:29.002 --> 04:30.771
<i>The concern is that
America manufactures</i>

04:30.904 --> 04:33.240
<i>only 12% of the
world's semiconductors.</i>

04:33.374 --> 04:36.276
<i>The most advanced chips
are manufactured in Taiwan.</i>

04:36.410 --> 04:38.646
<i>If our ability to
import them is threatened,</i>

04:38.779 --> 04:40.514
<i>then so is our economy.</i>

04:40.648 --> 04:41.982
<i>You say
the attempted theft</i>

04:42.115 --> 04:44.251
<i>poses a national-security
threat.</i>

04:44.385 --> 04:45.619
<i>Absolutely.</i>
What are you watching?

04:45.753 --> 04:47.855
My ex-boss.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.557
<i>The target was a shipment
transported from Asia.</i>

04:49.690 --> 04:51.124
<i>The Bureau assigned
an undercover team</i>

04:51.258 --> 04:52.760
<i>to infiltrate and identify
the perpetrators,</i>

04:52.893 --> 04:54.628
<i>which I'm told
they were unable to do.</i>

04:54.762 --> 04:56.564
<i>In the past two years,
this country has seen...</i>

04:56.697 --> 04:59.867
Come on. Why are we
listening to this?

05:00.000 --> 05:01.602
You aren't taking the meeting
with Conroy seriously.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.537
It's okay.
I'm prepared for it.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.806
<i>...rise in crime...</i>

05:05.939 --> 05:07.908
No one's <i>prepared</i>
for Conroy.

05:08.041 --> 05:10.944
You <i>endure</i> Conroy.
You <i>suffer</i> him.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.147
You supplicate yourself in
the microscopically vain hope

05:14.281 --> 05:17.117
that he will agree to be
an angel investor in our idea,

05:17.250 --> 05:21.154
which, to date,
is notable only for costing
us our life savings.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.623
So, you know...

05:22.756 --> 05:24.291
<i>So when they...</i>

05:24.425 --> 05:27.428
I need you to focus
on that, only that.

05:27.561 --> 05:30.163
Okay.
I got you, Nick.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.766
<i>Criminal empires are like
authoritarian regimes.</i>

05:32.900 --> 05:35.335
<i>Most often ruled by a single,
all-powerful leader.</i>

05:35.469 --> 05:39.306
<i>When that power becomes
decentralized or fractured,</i>

05:39.440 --> 05:42.009
<i>it leads to a period
of chaos and instability.</i>

05:42.142 --> 05:44.144
<i>So when the leader of
a criminal organization</i>

05:44.277 --> 05:45.713
<i>steps down or dies,</i>

05:45.846 --> 05:48.015
<i>there's inevitably
a rise in crime</i>

05:48.148 --> 05:50.484
<i>as others fight for control
over what he left behind.</i>

05:50.618 --> 05:52.185
Reddington.
<i>Are you saying</i>

05:52.319 --> 05:55.255
<i>powerful crime bosses can
actually make the world safer?</i>

05:55.389 --> 05:57.190
<i>There are a lot of criminals
that we don't know exist.</i>

05:57.324 --> 05:59.159
<i>The best of the crime bosses
know them all</i>

05:59.292 --> 06:01.562
<i>and have the power to keep
many of them in check.</i>

06:01.695 --> 06:03.764
<i>So, when they stop doing that,
then, yes,</i>

06:03.897 --> 06:06.266
<i>the world is less safe
as a result.</i>

06:10.438 --> 06:12.005
I can boost your meds.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.174
It's fine.

06:14.307 --> 06:17.377
My friend. I came
as soon as I could.

06:17.511 --> 06:18.779
How is he?
Stubborn.

06:18.912 --> 06:21.348
His flak jacket
acted like a furnace.

06:21.482 --> 06:24.184
He's got third-degree burns
on his upper arms and torso

06:24.317 --> 06:26.353
and not enough pain meds
in his system.

06:26.487 --> 06:28.155
Not until we talk.

06:28.288 --> 06:30.190
So <i>you're</i> the reason.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.760
I'll give you a few minutes.
Please talk.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.327
So he can have some peace.

06:38.766 --> 06:40.701
I need to find him.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.503
The man who killed Laver.

06:45.773 --> 06:49.409
The passcode...
I-S-H-Q.

06:50.077 --> 06:50.911
The first photo.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.414
Six months undercover,
I don't know the buyer.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.651
All I have is that.
Both mercs had it.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.887
Do you know what it means?
No.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.755
Neither does anyone
at the Bureau.

07:02.723 --> 07:04.658
But we both know
who might.

07:05.893 --> 07:07.360
When was the last time
you spoke?

07:07.495 --> 07:11.264
A year and a half.
I can't reach him.

07:11.398 --> 07:13.867
But you have Agnes,
so I assume you can.

07:14.001 --> 07:17.170
What's the protocol?
How do we make contact?

07:28.916 --> 07:30.584
I'm getting too old for this.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.186
What were you thinking?

07:34.287 --> 07:35.689
Killing an FBI agent.

07:37.057 --> 07:40.060
You're putting us at risk.
Jeopardizing the brand.

07:42.796 --> 07:45.232
You gave me this opportunity,
so I come to you when you call

07:45.365 --> 07:47.067
and I listen to you
blah-blah-blah

07:47.200 --> 07:49.269
about playing it so safe
that if I didn't know better,

07:49.402 --> 07:51.905
I'd say you were once the CEO
of an insurance company.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.507
But I <i>do</i> know better.

07:53.641 --> 07:56.076
Certainly better than
some old fool
the world's passed by.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.146
What you see as a problem
I see as an opportunity.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.950
I doubt the buyer
thinks his microchips

08:03.083 --> 08:04.818
getting incinerated
is much of an opportunity.

08:04.952 --> 08:07.755
Plan "A" was to get
the product.

08:07.888 --> 08:11.324
Plan "B" is to get
to the secret to how
the product is made.

08:11.458 --> 08:13.861
That way, the buyer can make
the product themselves.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.596
There's gonna be
an investigation.

08:15.729 --> 08:17.464
Things could get exposed.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.966
If I were you,
I'd let it go.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.001
You <i>were</i> me.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.137
And you gave it all up
to play golf.

08:27.641 --> 08:28.809
May I borrow this?

08:28.942 --> 08:30.110
You gonna hit some balls?

08:30.978 --> 08:33.146
Yeah.
I might give 'em a whack.

08:39.452 --> 08:41.154
It's not my fault.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.356
I told you
everything I knew about
where the chips would be.

08:43.490 --> 08:45.893
How could I know the FBI
was watching the port
in Los Angeles?

08:46.026 --> 08:49.129
That's all in the past.
Now the plans have changed.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.931
I need to know
how to make them,

08:51.064 --> 08:53.400
the knowledge and
the processing software.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.769
Luckily, the person who can
give me both is your boss.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.805
Where does <i>he</i> live?
I don't know.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.975
You golf?

09:07.948 --> 09:10.217
Are the fingers supposed
to be interlocked?

09:11.251 --> 09:12.720
Forget it. Heh.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.688
If I get it wrong,
I'll take a, uh...

09:14.822 --> 09:16.356
What do you call it?
A mulligan?

09:16.489 --> 09:18.726
Yes. A mulligan.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.293
Thank you.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.877
Perfect timing.

09:39.012 --> 09:40.013
I'm not here to drink.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.348
I know why you're here.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.582
I've sent for the doctor.

09:42.716 --> 09:44.217
I came to see Reddington.

09:44.351 --> 09:45.953
Which is why
I called the doctor.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.721
Like you,
I follow protocol.

09:47.855 --> 09:50.924
Put a mark on a mailbox,
I call the doctor.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.060
If Reddington wants you
to find him, you will.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.829
If he doesn't, you won't.
Sit. Drink.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.031
The doctor
will be here soon.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.570
A list of sights
to see in Havana.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.673
I highly recommend
La Cabana.

10:06.974 --> 10:09.042
I'm leaving. As soon
as I speak with Reddington.

10:09.176 --> 10:10.377
I'm sure you will.

10:10.510 --> 10:12.579
But that won't be
for a few days.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.748
There was a flood
in the Amazon.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.549
The Amazon?

10:18.686 --> 10:20.153
I thought he was
in Cu... Cuba.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.589
He might be.
Eventually.

10:22.723 --> 10:26.226
I can't wait.
This...

10:27.928 --> 10:29.629
Why I came,
it's...urgent.

10:35.235 --> 10:38.638
Once you finish your scan
and his identify is verified,

10:39.406 --> 10:40.741
I'll call the sisters.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.525
Look at me.

10:59.392 --> 11:00.794
Come closer.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.429
I'm here
to see Reddington.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.113
Crack it
into the water.

11:29.089 --> 11:31.624
What do you see?
The shape.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.493
Tell me.

11:33.626 --> 11:35.628
A cloudy orb.

11:35.763 --> 11:37.898
The sun breaking
through the clouds.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.466
Is that good or bad?

11:39.599 --> 11:40.600
You may pass.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.702
Very few do.

11:42.836 --> 11:45.138
Go.
I will watch over you.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.421
How is Agnes?

12:01.554 --> 12:02.522
She's good.

12:03.256 --> 12:04.324
Thriving.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.194
I see you've met Weecha.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.162
And a bartender
who drugged me,

12:09.296 --> 12:11.331
and a shaman who rubbed me
with an egg.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.367
Hm. Weecha protects my body,
Mierce my soul.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.169
I wouldn't have survived
the past two years

12:16.303 --> 12:17.170
if I hadn't found them.

12:26.213 --> 12:27.580
What do you want,
Harold?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.349
It's about Dembe.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.885
How is
Special Agent Zuma?

12:32.019 --> 12:33.353
In the hospital
with third-degree burns.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.089
His partner
was shot and killed.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.858
We don't know anything
about the assailants

12:37.991 --> 12:39.459
except for this tattoo.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.995
You don't want
to show me that.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.596
I do if it
will help Dembe.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.533
During the past two years,

12:46.666 --> 12:49.903
I've learned what to hold onto
and what to let go of.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.707
If I look at that,
if I come back, even once...

12:58.345 --> 13:00.713
...I fear all that work
will be for nothing.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.116
There would be names
to be taken,

13:03.250 --> 13:06.219
people would be
held accountable.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.922
Down the line,
things would get very dark.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.090
Then don't come back.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.225
But tell me
what <i>I</i> need to know.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.061
The symbol.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.229
Do you know it?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.400
Yes.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.534
You know
who we're looking for?

13:22.035 --> 13:23.236
I do.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.439
A 700-year-old pirate.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.105
I'm sending you his itinerary.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.506
<i>Chen is staying
at the Fountain Grand</i>

14:33.640 --> 14:34.874
<i>with his wife and daughter.</i>

14:35.008 --> 14:36.676
The more the merrier.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.550
FBI! Open the door!

14:49.489 --> 14:50.857
Put your hands
where we can see them!

14:50.991 --> 14:52.525
Put your hands
where we can see them!

14:52.659 --> 14:54.061
You're all dead!

14:54.194 --> 14:57.130
Well! That sucked!
Perkins?

14:57.264 --> 14:58.698
We didn't sweep
every room.

14:58.831 --> 15:00.233
And the first rule
after a breach?

15:00.367 --> 15:03.336
Sweep every room.
Let's run it again.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.077
Hello, Alina.

15:10.210 --> 15:11.979
I heard about Dembe.
How is he?

15:12.112 --> 15:15.082
Not good.
Which is why I came.
We have a case.

15:15.215 --> 15:16.249
I'm not a field agent
anymore.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.051
And I'm not
with the Bureau.

15:18.185 --> 15:21.021
But Dembe
asked me to do this.
Now I'm asking you.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.456
Just this once.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.358
I trained Ken,
and I want to help Dembe.

15:25.492 --> 15:27.327
Congratulations, by the way,
on the wedding.

15:27.460 --> 15:28.761
I'm happy for you.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.363
It's been great.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.065
And if I want
to keep it that way,

15:32.199 --> 15:33.266
I can't go back
to the field.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.368
I promised Peter
I wouldn't go back.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.936
I didn't know
you trained Ken.

15:37.070 --> 15:38.471
He was in my first class.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.174
He was a good agent
and a better man.

15:41.308 --> 15:44.111
I know the stress that field
work can put on you. I do.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.912
And, still, I'm asking.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.947
That's how important
I think this is.

15:50.883 --> 15:53.220
So, Flagify is a company
that warns clients

15:53.353 --> 15:55.155
about security issues
or red flags.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.090
It has
multiple platforms,

15:57.224 --> 15:59.559
each designed to fulfill
a different security need.

15:59.692 --> 16:02.295
Now, ShadowSee
is piracy detection.

16:02.429 --> 16:04.931
It scans up to a million
websites an hour

16:05.065 --> 16:07.400
to determine if a specific
production is being used

16:07.534 --> 16:09.336
in violation
to copyright restrictions.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.139
Now, Greylock uses
key words to, um...

16:12.272 --> 16:13.706
I'm sorry.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.941
It's, uh...

16:15.075 --> 16:17.310
Nothing.
It's nothing.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.748
You were
talking about Greylock.

16:21.881 --> 16:27.254
Yes. Greylock uses
key words to determine
sentiment analysis.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.988
This function
has a forensic...

16:29.122 --> 16:31.658
Oh, dear.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.760
Uh, I think
I should take this.
I'm... I'm so sorry.

16:33.893 --> 16:35.162
I don't invest in sorry.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.630
I invest in focus
and concentration.

16:37.764 --> 16:40.600
In the people who have it.
Not in the people who don't.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.770
Just... Um...
Just... Um... Sir?

16:43.903 --> 16:46.173
My parents took out
a second mortgage for us.

16:46.306 --> 16:48.741
So tell whoever that is
he just cost them their house.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.611
One second.
Nick, Nick.

16:52.912 --> 16:54.013
Mr. Cooper.

17:20.740 --> 17:22.609
I hope it wasn't a bad time
to bother you.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.344
It wasn't bad.

17:24.477 --> 17:25.512
It was
a horribly bad time.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.481
There's the Scotch.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.290
What did Peter say?

17:38.458 --> 17:39.192
What makes you think
I told him?

17:45.565 --> 17:48.568
Thanks for coming.
Let's get started.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.069
Uh, what about Ressler?

17:55.007 --> 17:56.075
Nice ride.

17:58.311 --> 18:00.413
The answer's no.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.014
You don't even know
what I'm gonna ask.

18:02.149 --> 18:04.884
Well, I know you came all
the way to Detroit to ask it.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.154
I saw you on the news
talking about Reddington.

18:07.287 --> 18:09.422
At least it <i>sounded</i>
like Reddington.

18:09.556 --> 18:11.090
I was just answering
the question.

18:11.224 --> 18:14.527
Then, please, answer mine...
Is Reddington involved?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.264
Not really.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.266
"Not really" isn't "no."

18:19.399 --> 18:20.900
Which is my answer.

18:22.369 --> 18:23.736
He still blames Reddington
for what happened.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.005
We all do.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.941
Well, uh, I guess
the difference for me

18:29.075 --> 18:31.244
and... and maybe you guys,
as well, is that I believe

18:31.378 --> 18:33.045
Mr. Reddington
blames himself.

18:33.180 --> 18:35.382
Um, and I forgive him
for it.

18:37.150 --> 18:39.786
The Silicon Shield.
Tell me what
you know about it.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.689
Right.
Um, it's a term used to
describe the protection

18:42.822 --> 18:44.891
Taiwan gets for being
the sole manufacturer

18:45.024 --> 18:47.093
of next-gen microchips...
protection from America,

18:47.227 --> 18:51.097
which might go to war
to prevent the supply
from being disrupted.

18:51.231 --> 18:52.899
Which means we're talking
about a tripwire,

18:53.032 --> 18:55.468
one the Skinner
apparently wants to trip.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.903
"The Skinner"?

18:57.036 --> 18:59.306
Right.
How to explain this.

18:59.439 --> 19:01.974
According to Reddington,
highway robbery and plunder

19:02.108 --> 19:04.143
may not be the world's
second-oldest profession...

19:04.277 --> 19:06.579
...second-oldest profession,
but it runs a close third.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.582
The Skinner practices

19:09.716 --> 19:12.452
a well-documented version
of brigandage.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.387
The dacoits in India.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.689
Gentlemen Reivers
in Scotland.

19:16.823 --> 19:18.958
In Devonshire,
the Gubbings.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.494
In America, Highwaymen.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.931
Different countries,
different centuries.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.333
All outlaws.

19:26.466 --> 19:27.900
And in France.
<i>And in France.</i>

19:28.034 --> 19:29.269
The ecorcheurs.

19:29.936 --> 19:31.538
The flayers.

19:31.671 --> 19:35.007
Armed bands who rose up
in opposition to Charles VII.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.477
They took what they wanted,
and when people resisted,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.312
they burned their feet
in fire.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.148
The mercs Dembe shot
all had this.

19:42.282 --> 19:44.651
Fire, surrounding
the letter "S,"

19:44.784 --> 19:47.320
for the "Skinners,"
who burn people alive.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.523
So we know who they were.
Who are they know?

19:50.657 --> 19:54.627
The original Skinner died
quite suddenly in 1452.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.597
He had a fearsome
reputation,

19:57.730 --> 19:59.131
and his followers worried

19:59.266 --> 20:01.634
that, without him,
their days were numbered.

20:01.768 --> 20:05.538
So, as no one knew
he had died,

20:05.672 --> 20:08.675
they elevated
one of their own
to take his place,

20:08.808 --> 20:12.645
beginning a line of succession
that continues to this day.

20:12.779 --> 20:15.782
The Skinner
is more myth than man,

20:15.915 --> 20:20.186
so the identity of the man
personifying the myth

20:20.320 --> 20:23.022
has always been
a carefully guarded secret.

20:23.155 --> 20:25.024
And does Mr. Reddington
know the secret?

20:25.157 --> 20:26.459
If he does,
he's not saying.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.227
What?
He's not coming back?

20:28.361 --> 20:31.964
E... Come on. Even for Dembe?
How... How is that possible?

20:32.098 --> 20:34.066
I don't know.
And he wouldn't say.

20:34.200 --> 20:37.169
All I <i>do</i> know is it's our job
to find the current Skinner,

20:37.304 --> 20:39.406
whose goal it was
to steal 800,000

20:39.539 --> 20:41.474
of the world's
most advanced microchips.

20:41.608 --> 20:43.175
Dembe stopped him once.

20:43.310 --> 20:45.044
Unless we find him,
I'm sure he'll try again.

20:45.177 --> 20:46.313
Before we do that...

20:47.380 --> 20:49.048
I know none of us
expected to be here,

20:49.181 --> 20:50.550
and it's...

20:51.551 --> 20:54.454
It's hard.
And it's a little weird.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.323
But, um,
if it's okay with you,

20:56.456 --> 20:59.091
I'd, uh, like us
to take a moment to,

21:00.159 --> 21:02.061
uh, to remember Liz.

21:02.194 --> 21:03.530
You know, uh,

21:04.331 --> 21:06.232
together.

21:06.366 --> 21:07.767
Think we can do that?

21:07.900 --> 21:09.969
I'm embarrassed
I didn't suggest it myself.

21:38.931 --> 21:40.232
I bet she's happy here.

21:40.367 --> 21:42.335
She's also asleep.

21:44.236 --> 21:47.640
Mierce has powers, Harold.
All for the good.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.209
Agnes is fine.

21:53.279 --> 21:55.648
What if I wanted
to see her?

21:57.417 --> 21:59.251
I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.160
Right.

22:08.294 --> 22:11.664
I don't know
who the current Skinner is,

22:11.798 --> 22:14.501
but I do know
his predecessor,

22:14.634 --> 22:16.436
and that's where
we're gonna start.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.710
He just showed up?
In the middle of the night?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.211
With a witch?

22:25.344 --> 22:26.846
The more you think about it,
the less sense it makes.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.448
It makes as much sense
as a Skinner living

22:28.581 --> 22:29.782
in a retirement community.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.784
<i>Don't let the salmon shirt
fool you.</i>

22:31.918 --> 22:33.920
Remember what Reddington
told me about the <i>old</i> Skinner.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.988
His name
is Vincent Duke.

22:36.122 --> 22:39.158
He ran the organization
for almost 30 years.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.160
Built on its history
of hijacking

22:41.293 --> 22:43.963
whatever commodity
was most in demand.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.332
His predecessors
commandeered guns

22:46.466 --> 22:48.367
from the Spanish Armada,

22:48.501 --> 22:51.538
gold from Russian tsars.

22:51.671 --> 22:54.907
Duke's plunder was
a little more contemporary,

22:55.041 --> 22:58.811
everything from intellectual
property to uranium.

22:58.945 --> 23:01.347
If you know him,
why do you need
our help to make contact?

23:01.481 --> 23:04.551
We had a falling-out.
Over a word.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.185
One word?
Yes.

23:06.318 --> 23:07.319
"Ex."

23:08.888 --> 23:11.190
As in ex-wife.
Apparently, she wasn't.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.527
Here we go.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.868
Sir, are you
ready for this?

23:22.001 --> 23:23.836
I'm not looking forward to it,
if that's what you mean.

23:23.970 --> 23:26.506
He's leaving the country club,
turning onto Saw Mill Road.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.907
He's heading your way.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.215
I have a twenty.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.856
You all right, sir?

23:43.990 --> 23:45.458
I'm fine. Go.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.393
Deal with it and get us
out of here quickly.

23:53.332 --> 23:54.901
What the hell happened?

23:55.034 --> 23:57.036
That's <i>my</i> question.
You slammed on the brakes!

23:57.169 --> 23:58.971
I don't believe this!
I just bought this car!

23:59.105 --> 24:00.773
It's brand-new!
You stopped short!

24:00.907 --> 24:03.175
I stop...
Oh, so this is <i>my</i> fault?

24:03.309 --> 24:04.777
You hit me from behind!

24:04.911 --> 24:07.079
Everybody! Step to
the side of the road now!

24:07.213 --> 24:08.247
Who was driving?

24:08.380 --> 24:09.749
I was. And this man.

24:12.552 --> 24:15.087
Hands in the air!
Whoa! Take it easy.

24:15.221 --> 24:17.456
I'm licensed to carry.
Up against the car, now!

24:17.590 --> 24:19.025
We're both
armed security!

24:19.158 --> 24:21.528
If that's true,
then there's nothing
to worry about,

24:21.661 --> 24:23.129
but we <i>are</i> gonna
have to check it out.

24:24.764 --> 24:27.600
What's going on?
Officer, this was an accident.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.902
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to stay right there, please.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.607
Let's wrap this up
before anyone else
can crash the party.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.726
Vincent.
Need a lift?

24:56.963 --> 24:58.831
That's why
you've kidnapped me.

24:58.965 --> 25:01.433
To ask me to betray
my own organization.

25:01.568 --> 25:03.536
No.
To urge you to save it.

25:03.670 --> 25:05.738
What makes you think
it needs saving?

25:05.872 --> 25:08.074
Well, I know
about the microchips

25:08.207 --> 25:11.944
and the dead FBI agent and
the one in intensive care.

25:12.078 --> 25:15.114
I know port security
has increased as a result,

25:15.247 --> 25:17.483
which certainly hurts
<i>my</i> organization.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.018
Oh, so you're not here
to help <i>me.</i>

25:19.151 --> 25:21.353
You're here
to save yourself.

25:21.487 --> 25:23.455
Self-serving as always.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.191
How <i>is</i> Bianca?

25:25.324 --> 25:26.593
No idea.

25:26.726 --> 25:28.427
You'd have to ask
the golf pro.

25:29.996 --> 25:31.898
The last thing
you and I want

25:32.031 --> 25:34.333
is the American government
on alert,

25:34.466 --> 25:37.369
adding billions
to Homeland Security.

25:37.503 --> 25:40.873
Is that really gonna happen?
Over a shipment of microchips?

25:41.007 --> 25:43.509
SCG microchips
that, apparently,

25:43.643 --> 25:46.913
none of the brilliant minds
in America know how to make.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.416
Any <i>hint</i> of a weak link
in that supply chain

25:50.549 --> 25:54.220
will be viewed as a <i>huge</i>
national-security threat.

25:55.922 --> 25:57.523
I don't like what he did,

25:57.657 --> 25:59.926
but I have no influence
on my successor.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.928
Believe me.
I've tried to exert it.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.731
You picked
an unworthy successor.

26:04.864 --> 26:05.898
That's not a judgment.

26:06.032 --> 26:09.301
I failed spectacularly
when I tried.

26:09.435 --> 26:11.804
But it's true, and something
needs to be done about it.

26:15.274 --> 26:17.910
I'm sorry about the golf pro,
by the way.

26:18.044 --> 26:19.411
Don't be.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.214
Before they ran off,
he fixed my slice.

26:22.348 --> 26:24.851
All in all,
a pretty fair exchange.

26:29.856 --> 26:31.624
Vincent, you're certain?

26:31.758 --> 26:33.926
Beck? Thank you, Vincent.

26:34.060 --> 26:35.594
I'll call you
when it's resolved.

26:41.000 --> 26:42.835
<i>Cooper.</i>
Harold. I have news.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.904
The Skinner is in New York
at the Fountain Grand,

26:45.037 --> 26:46.605
under the name Clayton Beck.

26:46.739 --> 26:48.107
You trust Duke's intel?

26:48.240 --> 26:50.209
That he's willing
to betray his successor?

26:50.342 --> 26:51.644
<i>He understands
that the legacy</i>

26:51.778 --> 26:54.446
is more important
than any one Skinner.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.382
Why New York?
It can't be the microchips.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.384
They're not shipped
to the East Coast.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.053
Perhaps he's found another way
to skin this cat.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.589
Listen. I have Edward
standing by.

27:03.723 --> 27:06.425
If you want it,
you can be wheels up
as soon as you're ready.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.327
That's a generous offer,
and I'll take you up on it,

27:08.460 --> 27:11.030
but before I do, I wanted
to circle back to Agnes,

27:11.163 --> 27:12.431
our conversation earlier.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.600
You were clear
about boundaries.

27:14.734 --> 27:17.203
<i>Yes, and I want to thank you
for respecting them.</i>

27:17.336 --> 27:19.906
Elizabeth made you
Agnes' guardian.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.141
<i>She was confident that
you'd do right by her.</i>

27:22.274 --> 27:24.811
I have no doubt that you have
and you will.

27:27.579 --> 27:30.883
When will you tell me?
What she means to you?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.854
I can tell you now.

27:36.388 --> 27:37.990
She means everything to me.

27:49.736 --> 27:51.103
I'm sorry,
but something's come up.

27:52.438 --> 27:53.806
I don't know how late,
but...

27:53.940 --> 27:56.042
Yes, as soon as possible.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.444
Mm-hmm. Love you, too.

27:58.577 --> 28:01.280
Take it from me...
keeping secrets

28:01.413 --> 28:03.282
is not the secret
to a happy marriage.

28:03.415 --> 28:06.518
I'm not keeping secrets.
I'm...keeping the peace.

28:06.652 --> 28:08.454
Is it possible
Peter will understand?

28:08.587 --> 28:11.490
How could he? I don't.
What am I doing in the field?

28:11.623 --> 28:13.860
I left for
my mental health.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.995
Yeah, well,
you and me both.

28:16.128 --> 28:17.463
Well...

28:17.596 --> 28:19.131
Here's a pleasant
surprise.

28:20.366 --> 28:21.868
Aram called me
about Dembe.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.870
I'm sure he'll appreciate
your concern.

28:24.003 --> 28:27.073
Well, I came out of concern
<i>and</i> curiosity

28:27.206 --> 28:29.708
about his health and,
uh, how the hell
he became an agent.

28:30.777 --> 28:32.044
You look a mess.

28:33.079 --> 28:34.613
Where's Aram, anyway?

28:34.747 --> 28:36.648
Well, that's another reason
I'm here... to take his place.

28:36.783 --> 28:38.184
He called,
said he had to bail.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.886
Something about everything
he's been working on

28:40.019 --> 28:41.720
for the past two years
blowing up in his face

28:41.854 --> 28:43.489
and him needing
to try to fix it.

28:43.622 --> 28:45.191
You were right, by the way.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.726
Reddington <i>is</i> involved.
Sort of.

28:47.860 --> 28:51.563
Then for his sake,
I hope we're never
in the same room together.

28:51.697 --> 28:55.334
But Aram tells me
we're going after some
700-year-old pirate?

28:55.467 --> 28:57.269
We don't know his real name,
but Dembe's given us

28:57.403 --> 28:59.071
a description,
and Reddington's told us

28:59.205 --> 29:02.174
he's on his way to a hotel
in New York, and so are we.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.280
You're sure
this is right?

29:08.414 --> 29:10.449
The concierge said
that Beck came here?

29:10.582 --> 29:12.785
Said he asked for directions
about an hour ago.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.386
Why?
He didn't know.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.755
Well, I'd say it's a safe bet
it's not to smell the flowers.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.091
Well, whatever the reason,
we're not gonna leave here

29:19.225 --> 29:20.592
until we find out
what it was.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.966
Okay. Deep breath.

29:31.503 --> 29:33.339
Oh. You're not
Eric and Barbara.

29:33.472 --> 29:34.773
No. Not Eric and Barbara.

29:34.907 --> 29:38.010
Or... Or Eric.
Or Barbara.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.645
Honey, is that
Eric and Barbara?

29:41.047 --> 29:42.614
Hello.

29:42.748 --> 29:44.416
You've got to be kidding me!
I know.

29:44.550 --> 29:46.252
I am way out of line, uh,
coming to your home like this,

29:46.385 --> 29:48.420
but I was hoping, uh,
you'd give me just, uh,

29:48.554 --> 29:50.389
two minutes to explain.
You had your two minutes.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.859
Well, actually, uh,
you walked out after
about a minute or so,

29:52.992 --> 29:54.961
so, technically, I have
unused time on the clock.

29:55.094 --> 29:57.496
At least, um... At least
about, uh, say, 40 seconds?

29:57.629 --> 29:59.932
You should leave.
Come on, Henry. He's here.

30:00.066 --> 30:01.767
And he's flop sweating.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.103
The party can spare your
sparkling conversation

30:04.236 --> 30:05.804
for 40 seconds.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.342
You'll get your 40 seconds

30:10.476 --> 30:12.511
once my guests all have
drinks in their hands.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.246
Okay, I used to be
an FBI agent.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.582
The call, during the pitch,
it was from my old boss.

30:16.715 --> 30:18.150
You're wasting your
40 seconds telling me

30:18.284 --> 30:19.818
about what you used to do
for a living?

30:19.952 --> 30:22.321
He needed help
on a case with national
security implications.

30:22.454 --> 30:24.790
He's actually
working the case
now without me

30:24.924 --> 30:28.260
because I am here,
with you, flop sweating.

30:29.661 --> 30:30.829
I'll be back.

30:30.963 --> 30:33.765
Don't sit.
Don't touch.

30:36.702 --> 30:38.604
Gotcha.

30:38.737 --> 30:41.473
So, Dembe's
an FBI agent now, huh?

30:41.607 --> 30:44.543
I think it's cool.
<i>Special agent for the FBI.</i>

30:44.676 --> 30:46.178
It sounds like you have
a problem with that.

30:46.312 --> 30:48.247
Well.
Problems, questions.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.349
We started with
a background check.

30:50.482 --> 30:52.919
<i>Did the Bureau
abolish them?</i>

30:53.052 --> 30:55.621
Hang on. That's him.
Right side of the statue.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.823
<i>Maintain your position.
What's he doing?</i>

30:57.957 --> 31:00.459
Watching the concession stand.
Looks like he's on comms.

31:00.592 --> 31:01.693
Which means
he's got company.

31:03.762 --> 31:06.298
All right.
I've got a second suspect.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.367
<i>Near the Madison Avenue exit.</i>

31:08.500 --> 31:10.602
Careful. We have to
assume they're armed.

31:10.736 --> 31:12.204
He's surveilling
somebody by the vendor.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.406
<i>The family buying hot dogs.</i>

31:14.540 --> 31:15.374
I see them.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.210
Who in the hell is <i>that?</i>

31:26.452 --> 31:29.255
I'm sending you a photo.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.657
Sir, I, I told Ressler...
<i>I know what you told him,</i>

31:31.790 --> 31:33.225
but the Skinner's
tracking someone,

31:33.359 --> 31:34.093
and I need you
to tell me who.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.394
Uh, I'm not at my desk.

31:35.527 --> 31:36.695
Then sit at someone else's.

31:36.828 --> 31:39.465
Aram, this is important.
Hang on.

31:39.598 --> 31:43.002
Okay. Um, an Asian man.
That's... That's it?

31:43.135 --> 31:44.536
The chips come from Taiwan.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.038
<i>Okay. Great.
That helps.</i>

31:46.172 --> 31:48.374
SCG microchips.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.875
All right. That's better.
That helps narrow it down.

31:50.009 --> 31:51.843
All you need to do us to hack
into the employee database.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.745
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's not great or...
or better.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.315
I can't do that.
I mean, sir, I <i>can</i> do that.

31:56.448 --> 31:59.251
I know how to, but I can't.
Not... Not from here.

31:59.385 --> 32:01.053
Call me back with a name.

32:01.187 --> 32:02.588
Sir. Sir, I don't...
Sir? Sir.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.197
Oh. Okay.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.943
Yes! Boom.
There you are.

32:26.178 --> 32:28.680
What are you doing?

32:28.814 --> 32:30.949
Nothing.
Uh, not nothing.

32:31.083 --> 32:33.385
Uh, I needed to hack
into a company's website
for just a second.

32:33.519 --> 32:34.987
On <i>my</i> computer?
In <i>my</i> house?

32:35.121 --> 32:37.156
I know. It looks
really bad, doesn't it?

32:37.289 --> 32:39.058
But my boss really needs
this information.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.562
Beck's on the move.

32:43.695 --> 32:45.397
I thought you weren't
working with the FBI.

32:45.531 --> 32:48.100
I'm not. Technically.
Bu... It's complicated.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.935
No, it's not.
It's simple, really.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.970
Get away from the computer,
or I'll have you arrested.

32:53.572 --> 32:56.575
Do not answer that phone!

32:58.677 --> 33:00.412
Sir, I have a name.
Chen Yu-lan.

33:00.546 --> 33:02.248
He's SCG's chief
technology officer.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.316
Certainly someone
who would have details

33:04.450 --> 33:05.817
to the company in question's
manufacturing process.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.586
<i>He couldn't steal
the microchips,</i>

33:07.719 --> 33:08.420
<i>so he's going after
the man that made them.</i>

33:08.554 --> 33:09.921
Great work, Aram.

33:12.624 --> 33:15.427
All it takes is a little
focus and concentration.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.330
All right.
Beck's following him out.

33:18.464 --> 33:20.299
Stop him!
Move in, now!

33:24.770 --> 33:26.105
Get in the van.

33:26.238 --> 33:28.807
Get in the van! Let's go!

33:28.940 --> 33:30.109
Get in the van!

33:30.242 --> 33:33.179
Stop! FBI!

33:33.312 --> 33:36.014
Tell J. Edgar Whoever-It-Is,
the more you try to stop me,

33:36.148 --> 33:37.549
the more innocent people
get hurt.

33:37.683 --> 33:39.118
No!

34:07.613 --> 34:09.881
Leave?
You can't leave. Not now.

34:10.015 --> 34:13.018
I did what I came to do,
identified the Skinner.

34:13.152 --> 34:15.387
Who we now know
has abducted a man
capable of mass-producing

34:15.521 --> 34:17.523
the world's
most advanced microchips,

34:17.656 --> 34:18.824
as well as his wife
and daughter.

34:18.957 --> 34:20.492
What's happening?
What are you doing?!

34:23.529 --> 34:24.863
Why are you doing this?!

34:27.966 --> 34:30.035
I'm doing this because
I'm following orders.

34:30.169 --> 34:32.738
I was told to.
If you're smart,
you'll do the same.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.009
<i>I don't know
who his client is,</i>

34:38.144 --> 34:40.246
but if I were the Skinner,
I'd think big.

34:40.379 --> 34:42.648
The superpowers want
to be self-sufficient.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.050
Who knows... it's possible
some government

34:45.184 --> 34:47.353
bankrolled this
from the start.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.655
And you're just
gonna walk away?

34:49.788 --> 34:54.092
I recently spent time
in a monastery
above Boudhanath

34:54.226 --> 34:58.530
with sweeping views
of Kathmandu,

34:58.664 --> 35:02.468
meditating alongside
36 Tibetan monks.

35:02.601 --> 35:06.772
I achieved an inner harmony
there that

35:08.707 --> 35:12.344
was more mind-blowing
than any psychedelic,

35:13.345 --> 35:16.114
and yet more fragile than,

35:17.349 --> 35:19.551
than an origami swan.

35:20.519 --> 35:22.654
That has to be cared for.

35:22.788 --> 35:27.493
If I stay here,
it will be torn and crushed.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.728
Be honest... is this
about inner peace

35:29.861 --> 35:31.963
or is this about my reluctance
to reintroduce you

35:32.097 --> 35:34.300
into Agnes' life,

35:34.433 --> 35:36.535
a reluctance I know
you blatantly ignored?

35:36.868 --> 35:38.570
Yes.

35:38.704 --> 35:41.540
You have her watched.
That was a pleasant surprise.

35:41.673 --> 35:43.709
Nothing will happen
to that girl.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.244
Not while she's in <i>my</i> care.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.254
She didn't see me.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.024
We need your help.

36:00.091 --> 36:01.793
We can't find the Skinner
without it.

36:13.872 --> 36:16.141
Keeping the girl from him
is cruel.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.610
Is that what you want?
To be cruel?

36:37.596 --> 36:39.097
I'm told
you're feeling better.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.367
Hm. I am.

36:41.500 --> 36:43.635
Mostly because I'm wasted.

36:44.470 --> 36:46.372
Yeah, I think
you're entitled.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.839
You look good.

36:47.973 --> 36:49.541
Sorry to hear
about your partner.

36:50.242 --> 36:51.643
Thank you.

36:52.978 --> 36:55.347
Are you all right?
You look a mess.

36:57.283 --> 36:59.385
Okay.
Is it really that bad?

36:59.518 --> 37:00.719
Yeah, it, uh...
it's not great.

37:03.689 --> 37:06.258
Was I hallucinating,
or was Raymond here?

37:06.392 --> 37:08.159
He was, but he's gone.

37:08.294 --> 37:10.362
Gone as in, like...
he's <i>gone</i> gone?

37:10.496 --> 37:12.063
It seems so.

37:12.197 --> 37:15.033
Along with his resources.
His contacts. His jet.

37:15.166 --> 37:16.702
And any hope of
finding the Skinner
and the family he took.

37:16.835 --> 37:19.838
I don't know about that.
We know his real name

37:19.971 --> 37:22.007
and have a list
of known addresses.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.410
I brought you a dossier.
Wait.

37:24.543 --> 37:27.846
A dossier that you copied
on Agnes' printer?

37:27.979 --> 37:32.217
The, uh, unicorn stationary.
It's a nice touch.

37:32.351 --> 37:35.020
Okay, yes.
We are a bit ragtag.

37:35.153 --> 37:37.856
We're up against
a well-financed
Blacklister with no budget.

37:37.989 --> 37:41.693
Or access to any databases
and no authorization.

37:41.827 --> 37:43.061
And you thought we were here
to cheer you <i>up.</i>

37:44.896 --> 37:47.599
Every two hours,
an ICU nurse debrides me.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.337
<i>She snips off dead skin
with tweezers.</i>

37:51.470 --> 37:54.072
It's slow and painful.

37:55.807 --> 37:57.309
And it's the only way to heal.

38:01.046 --> 38:02.314
We all have dead skin.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.116
All of us.

38:05.250 --> 38:09.154
And healing
will be slow and painful.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.323
But seeing you here,

38:11.457 --> 38:13.625
I can't think
of a better way to start.

38:15.561 --> 38:18.464
So, um, now what?

38:18.597 --> 38:20.131
We have a case to solve.

38:20.265 --> 38:23.034
And no time to solve it.
Which means
we start right away.

38:23.168 --> 38:24.903
I'll stay and bring Dembe
up to speed.

38:25.036 --> 38:26.938
If you have anything to
rearrange in your own lives,

38:27.072 --> 38:29.808
rearrange it
and meet back here in an hour.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.752
<i>** Action, reaction</i>

38:41.420 --> 38:43.088
♪* Stay with it...

38:43.221 --> 38:45.757
Okay, okay.
Are you insane?

38:45.891 --> 38:47.393
You talked to Conroy.

38:47.526 --> 38:49.928
You went to his house?
I'm so... I'm so sorry.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.763
If there's any way I can
make it up to you, Nick...

38:51.897 --> 38:53.231
Uh-huh.

38:54.099 --> 38:56.167
You could...
drop your pants.

38:56.968 --> 38:58.737
Except, uh, maybe that?

38:58.870 --> 39:00.872
Mnh-mnh. I'm serious.
I need to see 'em.

39:01.006 --> 39:03.942
"Stones"... and I quote...
"the size of Montana."

39:04.075 --> 39:05.544
What... Uh, what are you
talking about?

39:05.677 --> 39:08.113
Conroy. I don't know
what you did,
but the guy was impressed.

39:08.246 --> 39:10.782
He said that?
He said that about my stones?

39:11.650 --> 39:12.651
That's not all he said.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.319
Did he say he's in?

39:14.453 --> 39:17.122
He said he's intrigued.
And he wants to hear more.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.490
Like, now.

39:18.624 --> 39:19.991
As in <i>now?</i>
Yeah.

39:20.125 --> 39:23.094
As in, our dreams
are about to come true.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.330
Well,
unless you have somewhere
else you'd rather be.

39:25.464 --> 39:27.699
No. No. Uh...
Yeah.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.670
Uh, uh, I wanted to also
talk to you about that...

39:31.803 --> 39:33.238
Hey.

39:33.371 --> 39:34.873
No. Not yet.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.009
Yeah. Long day. But...

39:39.478 --> 39:40.846
Not at the office.

39:42.280 --> 39:45.517
I had a case. In the field.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.719
I know, I know.
I should've told you.
I'm sorry I didn't.

39:47.853 --> 39:49.320
I know how you feel. I do.

39:49.455 --> 39:51.990
But a family was abducted.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.627
No. It's not over.

39:56.928 --> 39:58.396
Not even for tonight.

39:58.530 --> 40:00.566
<i>** Update</i>

40:00.699 --> 40:02.834
An agent is here.
The bearded one.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.837
<i>** Head on **</i>

40:09.207 --> 40:12.410
This is the last
place I ever wanted to be.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.080
And yet here you are.
Please, sit.

40:18.817 --> 40:22.020
Liz... she knew all
about being where
she didn't want to be,

40:22.153 --> 40:24.355
doing what
she didn't want to do.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.257
Like running your empire.

40:26.391 --> 40:28.560
And all she wanted
was a life with Agnes.

40:29.895 --> 40:33.031
But the Blacklist
changed her mind,

40:33.164 --> 40:35.634
knowing the world would be
safer with it than without it.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.036
I mean, that's why she agreed
to be your successor,

40:38.169 --> 40:42.040
why she gave up everything,
including her life,

40:42.173 --> 40:45.076
to protect it,
keep it running.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.046
And then she died.

40:50.348 --> 40:53.519
We all just walked away
and left the Blacklist
to die with her.

40:56.154 --> 40:58.890
A life with Agnes
wasn't all she wanted.

41:01.092 --> 41:02.193
She wanted a life
with you.

41:06.197 --> 41:09.300
I know you don't need this.
I don't, either.

41:09.434 --> 41:10.902
As painful as it was
to walk away,

41:11.036 --> 41:12.804
it's just as painful
to come back.

41:14.573 --> 41:15.974
Maybe more.

41:16.107 --> 41:17.843
But the Blacklist
was her calling,

41:17.976 --> 41:20.278
and if we loved her,
it has to be ours.

41:21.747 --> 41:24.415
That's why I came back,
because as much as I hate you,

41:24.550 --> 41:26.384
I loved her more.

41:28.787 --> 41:30.488
His real name
is Graeme Anderson.

41:35.426 --> 41:38.697
He was a foster kid,
bounced around
until he aged out.

41:38.830 --> 41:40.799
Two years unaccounted for,
and then he does a year

41:40.932 --> 41:42.768
at Stanford,
where he becomes obsessed

41:42.901 --> 41:46.672
with the French
adventurer and smuggler
Henry de Monfreid.

41:46.805 --> 41:48.940
Of course.
A former Skinner.

41:49.074 --> 41:51.509
Why are you
telling me all this?

41:51.643 --> 41:54.913
Graeme Anderson
is the next name
on the Blacklist.

41:55.046 --> 41:58.149
Your Blacklist,
the one that Liz died for.

41:58.283 --> 41:59.585
And whether she died in vain
is up to you.

42:08.459 --> 42:09.427
I like him.

42:10.028 --> 42:11.196
He has a good soul.

42:12.598 --> 42:14.232
I believe he does.

42:16.635 --> 42:18.570
I'm less certain about mine.
