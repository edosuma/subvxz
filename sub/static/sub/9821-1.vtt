00:10.000 --> 00:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:34.206 --> 00:35.460
Thanks a lot.

00:35.465 --> 00:37.817
Sure. Where are you going?

00:38.850 --> 00:40.700
To the end of the highway.

00:44.300 --> 00:47.900
You are not running away
from home, are you?

00:49.302 --> 00:51.802
Did you hear me?

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
Mummy...

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
Hi, mom! Any more groceries out in the car?

03:01.700 --> 03:05.473
No, couldn't afford any more groceries.

03:06.023 --> 03:08.000
How come you're so late?

03:08.100 --> 03:11.350
Stopped by for a couple of drinks
with someone from work.

03:11.400 --> 03:15.500
Any objections?
-No, I was just wondering...

03:22.800 --> 03:26.055
Evan!!! -What?
Don't scream like that.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.406
I marked this label, you know.
-You did what?

03:29.595 --> 03:31.466
I said I marked it.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.720
And now not the hell of a lot
left in where I marked.

03:34.787 --> 03:36.750
Well, I didn't drink it.
-You're lying to me.

03:36.752 --> 03:39.100
I swear to god, it must have been you.
-Breathe on me.

03:39.150 --> 03:42.650
Come on...
-Come on! Breathe on me!

03:52.300 --> 03:57.059
God damn you!
I told you to throw out this trash this morning.

03:59.500 --> 04:01.467
Wait, mom, I forgot,
I'm sorry.

04:01.550 --> 04:04.380
Sorry? Don't tell me to cool it.
God damn it!

04:04.400 --> 04:08.900
I don't wanna work all day so you could
sit on your ass and read comic books.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.700
You make me sick when you look like that.

04:12.804 --> 04:15.650
It's your father in you.
Makes me sick...

04:15.750 --> 04:16.700
Well, that's not my fault.

04:16.750 --> 04:19.399
I didn't choose him to be
my father, you did.

04:19.600 --> 04:23.300
Yeah, and that was the biggest
mistake I ever made.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.881
Where are you going?

05:00.200 --> 05:03.320
I'm going away for a while.
Mom's having a hard time right now.

05:04.361 --> 05:08.290
But I don't want you to go anywhere.
-It's ok, and it's for the best.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.220
She'll be better when she has
one kid to take care of.

05:10.270 --> 05:12.000
You understand.

05:12.050 --> 05:16.000
But where are you gonna go?
-I don't know. I'll find somewhere.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.000
Just don't worry about it.
I'll call you up some time, ok?

05:46.600 --> 05:49.062
SUBURBIA

07:12.700 --> 07:15.100
<i>Now, what's this guy?
-Get a job.</i>

07:26.250 --> 07:30.950
Come on. Have some
fucking fun. Move up.

07:39.466 --> 07:42.616
Come on, you've got some money there!
-I spent it all on this...

08:20.500 --> 08:22.280
Now, remember, watch the floor.

08:22.288 --> 08:24.406
Speedily follow down their clashes by [...]

08:24.450 --> 08:27.383
so bouncers know where the trouble is. Okay?

08:43.100 --> 08:45.661
Hey, get going out of there!

09:41.900 --> 09:44.113
Hey, what about some drugs?

09:45.417 --> 09:48.950
Black triangles, man.
They are fucking excellent, I'm telling you.

09:50.300 --> 09:53.500
OK, if you change your mind,
I'm here.

10:05.600 --> 10:08.200
I think I'd like to fuck your brains out.

10:08.250 --> 10:12.670
What?
-I said I think I'd like to fuck your brains out.

10:12.800 --> 10:17.600
Oh you would, huh?
Yeah, but it doesn't look like you have any.

11:30.400 --> 11:34.703
Hey, cut it off! Hey, leave her alone!
Come on you homos!

11:38.650 --> 11:41.534
Perfect example
of punk rock aggressiveness.

11:42.181 --> 11:44.381
Gonna get this club closed down
or something before...

11:44.600 --> 11:46.400
You, guys, have minds this big.

11:46.450 --> 11:48.716
All right, listen up, now get off!

11:54.150 --> 11:59.209
[...] turn that spot off, stupid!
And I'll give her goddamn clothes back!

12:00.050 --> 12:03.767
And you guys wanna hear more music you
give her clothes back right now, suckers!

12:06.300 --> 12:08.862
Attention, please!
Don't [...] and give her clothes back!

12:13.300 --> 12:15.809
All right, that's, fine, show's over.

12:17.400 --> 12:19.721
You guys are blowing your own city now.

12:19.900 --> 12:21.400
Fuck you!

12:24.198 --> 12:26.198
That's fucking typical.

12:28.700 --> 12:30.935
<i>All right, give them the muzak.</i>

12:50.450 --> 12:53.672
Come on, kid, on your feet.
Party's over.

13:03.945 --> 13:08.445
<i>You're such a fucking bitch.
You're so stupid, I swear that.</i>

13:10.300 --> 13:11.800
Get out.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.633
And don't kick my car, pig!
-You call that a car?

13:21.800 --> 13:24.200
What a total asshole!

13:27.100 --> 13:30.247
Hey, kid, pretty fucked up, huh?
-Aha.

13:30.350 --> 13:32.500
Get up. Need a lift home?

13:33.300 --> 13:36.200
I can't go home.
-Can't sleep on the grass.

13:36.342 --> 13:39.047
The snails will crawl on your face.
Come on.

13:43.800 --> 13:46.524
What's your name?
-Jack.

13:46.700 --> 13:47.987
Jack?

13:50.700 --> 13:52.500
Yeah, Jack Diddley.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.750
Looks like it's starting to rain.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.500
No, that's just the acid rain

13:59.518 --> 14:01.850
that comes down every night
about this time.

14:02.500 --> 14:03.900
Oh, yeah?

14:12.800 --> 14:15.889
Did you hear of a guy named Joe Schmo?
-Nope, never.

14:15.900 --> 14:18.950
Well, his old man's a homo and he
can't stand living with him anymore,

14:19.003 --> 14:22.308
so we're gonna go to pick him up
and take him out to the T.R. house, ok?

14:22.500 --> 14:23.920
What's T.R. house?

14:24.150 --> 14:26.616
It's one of those houses out by the 605.

14:27.050 --> 14:28.642
County bought them up years ago

14:28.905 --> 14:31.800
and just left then sitting there
all boarded up and rotting.

14:31.950 --> 14:33.700
A bunch of us live in one of them.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.900
It's pretty trashed but it's free.
Are you up for it?

14:36.980 --> 14:39.415
It's not like I have anywhere else to go.

15:13.100 --> 15:15.100
Keep going, fuckers.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.393
My old man's a cop.
He's my stepdad.

15:18.395 --> 15:21.967
My real father died in Vietnam
and mom got married again.

15:22.000 --> 15:26.183
God, your stepdad's a cop.
-Yeah, that's not the worst of it though.

15:29.100 --> 15:33.250
He's black.
-Black? God! What a drag!

15:41.900 --> 15:44.804
Yeah, he came over to T.R.
one time to check it out.

15:44.950 --> 15:46.852
Told everyone he was my father.

15:47.100 --> 15:49.300
They laughed him right outta the door.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.700
Parents are so lame.

15:52.200 --> 15:55.742
What's that?
-My mom's diary. Listen to this.

15:56.100 --> 16:00.895
May 10th, 1968. Dear diary, Mark
and I are gonna be very happy here.

16:00.900 --> 16:04.275
The air is clear, skies are blue, and all
the houses are brand new and beautiful.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.500
They call it "suburbia" and
that word's perfect

16:06.523 --> 16:09.423
because it's a combination of
the words "suburb" and "utopia".

16:10.100 --> 16:12.781
They didn't realize it would
be the slum of the future.

16:12.950 --> 16:14.350
I'm sure with Mark's job at Lockheed

16:14.400 --> 16:15.900
I'll never have to work again.

16:15.980 --> 16:17.577
Huh, you wish...

16:17.600 --> 16:20.400
Oh, and by the way, diary,
we want to have a child soon.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.398
Suburbia is a great place for children.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.739
And if it's a boy we're gonna name him
Evan Mark Johnson.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.800
You know, sometimes I wish
she would have had an abortion.

16:31.250 --> 16:35.140
Oh, yeah? They were illegal
in those days.

16:46.550 --> 16:49.432
Hand me one of those bottles, will you?

17:00.300 --> 17:02.139
I hate buses.

17:14.750 --> 17:17.223
Hi, ya. Joe here?
-Hello, Jack.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.200
Where's Joe?
-In his bedroom.

17:19.400 --> 17:22.749
See if you can wake him up.
I gave up three hours ago.

17:44.100 --> 17:46.400
Dad, I thought I told you
to leave that alone.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.850
Oh, it's you...
What's going on?

17:57.650 --> 18:02.200
Moving out again, hey, Joe?
Don't I even get a good-bye this time?

18:02.800 --> 18:04.687
Later days.

18:10.000 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:31.000 --> 18:32.539
Hey, look at those dogs over there.

18:32.700 --> 18:36.144
Yeah, they are kind of nasty.
You gotta watch out for them.

18:36.600 --> 18:40.300
I heard they killed a little kid
out here the other day. - No shit?

18:40.950 --> 18:42.300
Where do they come from?

18:42.600 --> 18:45.980
Well, I heard that when people were forced
to move from their houses,

18:46.500 --> 18:48.400
that some of them left
their dogs behind them.

18:48.450 --> 18:50.753
Coyotes came down from
the hills and fucked them.

18:51.050 --> 18:54.550
After a while... wild dogs!

18:54.600 --> 18:57.937
Jees! That's pretty amazing.
-Where did you hear that from?

19:07.900 --> 19:10.038
There is a welcoming committee.

19:11.700 --> 19:16.234
Close your windows.
-Shit, I'm stuck.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.825
Oh, my god!

19:26.400 --> 19:31.100
Fleabags. Razzle - one of the guys
of the house - captured a couple of them.

19:31.150 --> 19:34.275
He thinks he can train them,
but we think he's a little bit tweaked.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.139
What's up?

20:16.850 --> 20:18.850
Shit, I forgot something.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.357
You wanna be next?
-Huh?

20:53.109 --> 20:54.949
A haircut.
How about a haircut?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.223
Ah, no, thanks,
I just had a haircut.

20:58.250 --> 21:01.078
You did? Could have fooled me!

21:17.200 --> 21:18.450
Slim pickings.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.550
Come on.

21:20.600 --> 21:23.200
Hey, Jack. Who's that girl
getting a haircut?

21:23.900 --> 21:25.496
Ah, that's Sheila.

21:26.700 --> 21:31.181
<i>Ha-ha-ha, that's very funny. Stay with us,
we'll be back after these messages.</i>

21:31.800 --> 21:36.724
<i>Are you experiencing feelings of alienation
and depression or loneliness?</i>

21:36.750 --> 21:41.725
<i>We at Southwest Woodside Hospital
know that these are cry for help.</i>

21:41.750 --> 21:43.370
<i>We're only a phone call away.</i>

21:43.500 --> 21:46.680
Oh yeah? I know somebody checked in
in one of those places.

21:46.700 --> 21:47.950
And you know what they cost?

21:48.000 --> 21:50.782
What?
-800 bucks a week.

21:55.700 --> 21:56.900
What did you say?

21:58.500 --> 22:00.200
I said if you had 800 bucks a week,

22:00.300 --> 22:02.300
you probably wouldn't be
depressed in the first place.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.170
That's true. What's your name?
-Evan.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.850
Did you get a burn, Evan?
-A burn?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.900
Now, what's a burn?

22:25.050 --> 22:27.950
Nobody is supposed to stay here
unless he gets a burn.

22:28.900 --> 22:32.100
See. It's kinda nice.
Comes out like this.

22:32.500 --> 22:34.700
Jesus, that will be there all your life.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.700
Well, that's the idea.
See, if we didn't do that

22:36.750 --> 22:38.650
we'd had all finds of flakes
hanging around.

22:38.700 --> 22:42.000
Yeah, that's may be a stupid question, but
what does it stand for anyways?

22:42.200 --> 22:44.150
Stands for "rejected".

22:45.500 --> 22:47.150
Sounds really stupid to me.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.900
Yeah. Well, stupid or not,
I don't have anywhere else to go.

22:50.550 --> 22:53.100
It's like some kind of ridiculous
initiation of something.

22:53.126 --> 22:55.600
So?
-So, I'm leaving.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.700
Do you wanna me to drive you back?

23:01.031 --> 23:04.245
No, I'll hitch.
Ain't you got better things to do?

23:06.080 --> 23:11.231
Watch out for big bad wolf.
-The dogs, watch out for the dogs.

24:03.200 --> 24:05.341
Dad? Let me in, it's me.

24:50.500 --> 24:53.499
Came back?
-Oh, yeah.

24:55.400 --> 24:58.855
How come?
-Well, because...

25:00.050 --> 25:03.543
Well, I'll tell you about it some day.
If I ever get to know you better.

25:05.550 --> 25:10.008
Are you gonna get a burn?
-I guess so.

25:10.700 --> 25:14.700
And I thought twice about getting mine.
-Is that right? Why not?

25:15.700 --> 25:19.190
Because I've got so many scars already.
-What kind of scars?

25:21.717 --> 25:24.285
Hmm... This kind.

25:25.300 --> 25:27.500
Jesus! What's that from?

25:29.950 --> 25:32.868
I'll tell you about it some day
if I ever get to know you better.

26:40.400 --> 26:42.121
What's going on?

26:42.661 --> 26:44.619
Looks like they are killing the dogs.

26:59.800 --> 27:01.800
They are not killing my dogs.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.503
Where are you going?
Come back!

27:18.600 --> 27:20.400
These are my dogs.

27:20.800 --> 27:25.465
What the hell are you dressed up for?
-Yeah. - Where's the war?

27:26.235 --> 27:28.986
Up your ass.
-Up your ass?

27:29.000 --> 27:34.059
I'd like the long end of this rifle up your ass.
-[Wait it], Skinner, look.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.400
What's the occasion?

27:54.500 --> 27:57.451
We just thought we're doing
our good Americans' work for the day.

27:57.700 --> 28:00.300
Did you hear about the little boy
that got killed by the dogs the other day?

28:00.400 --> 28:03.690
We heard of that.
-Hey, we've got a little one over here.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.702
[Put] that god damn gun.

28:10.900 --> 28:12.550
Well, little ones grow up
to be big ones, you know.

28:12.600 --> 28:14.250
Have you got papers for these guns?

28:14.300 --> 28:16.486
Officer, we are from
"Citizens against Crime".

28:16.700 --> 28:18.497
Most citizens are against crime, sir.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.200
The question was do you have
papers for the guns?

28:21.600 --> 28:23.400
Guns are all registered.

28:25.600 --> 28:30.058
Jim Tripplett? Bob Skokes?
-That's right.

28:30.553 --> 28:32.200
You know it's against law
to use fire arms

28:32.250 --> 28:33.650
inside the city limits, don't you?

28:33.700 --> 28:37.304
Yes, sir, we sure do, but this side of the street
is county property.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.300
May be if decide to come back again

28:39.350 --> 28:42.350
we should inform
the department or officer... Rennard.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.602
May be you should.
-I know what you're probably thinking.

28:44.650 --> 28:47.031
You just don't like private citizens
doing your work for you.

28:47.200 --> 28:48.578
You're right.

28:50.421 --> 28:54.618
By the way, officer,
is that legal inside of city limits?

28:55.300 --> 28:57.010
What the hell?

28:57.700 --> 29:02.991
Hey, may be we should look into there.
-No, that's our job. We'll handle.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.386
Got a big kick out of
shooting that dog, didn't you?

29:15.550 --> 29:18.600
Yeah, it's kinda fun.

29:19.500 --> 29:20.612
Fu-uck.

29:24.400 --> 29:27.600
That car looks awful to me.
Maybe we should run a make on it.

29:27.981 --> 29:30.650
It should. This car I gave
my son Jack last year

29:30.700 --> 29:32.550
when I bought my new one.

29:32.600 --> 29:34.225
It sure looks like he's fucked it up.

29:34.400 --> 29:37.765
Son of bitch, that IS your old Ford.
Come on, let's go check the place out.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.400
No, I'm more worried
about our vigilante sharp shooters

29:40.440 --> 29:43.215
then I am about a bunch of
teenagers in a crash pad.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.700
There's one.
Hoodi-doo, hoodi-doo!

31:10.400 --> 31:12.456
Mew! Bye, kitty.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.417
Ha-ha, that was so close!

32:49.642 --> 32:51.825
The big guy would have sat on me!

33:01.500 --> 33:03.500
Garage sale

33:09.000 --> 33:11.300
"When guns are outlawed
only outlaws will have guns"

33:12.650 --> 33:14.696
It's a nice camper.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.000
But if you're so in love with it,
why are you selling it?

33:18.100 --> 33:20.762
Oh, we don't want to.
Got a lot of money tied up in this.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.491
Yeah, you know, we've used it just about
every weekend for the last three years, but...

33:24.500 --> 33:27.152
since the layoff we had to cut back
a little on recreation.

33:27.200 --> 33:28.666
Oh, you were with GM?

33:29.021 --> 33:31.364
12 long years.
-14 for me.

33:31.700 --> 33:33.050
It's a helluva amount.

33:33.700 --> 33:36.379
Makes it tough to get out and have
a good time when you can't afford the gas.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.805
I'll tell you what.
Let me think about it.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.600
Maybe I'll give you a call.
Have a nice day!

33:48.200 --> 33:50.600
Have a nice day in my ass.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.800
<i>We can't work, can't hunt,</i>

33:53.850 --> 33:57.350
<i>can't get sold the damn camper,
can't do jackshit.</i>

33:57.700 --> 33:59.691
Come on, let me buy you a beer.

34:31.650 --> 34:34.020
Is there something special
you're looking for?

34:37.500 --> 34:41.310
Yeah. Got any vibrators?

34:55.100 --> 34:56.600
Not you again!

34:59.500 --> 35:03.126
You know what he said?
If we had any vibrators.

35:08.500 --> 35:10.800
Go, bastards and chickenshits!

35:26.800 --> 35:28.900
Oh, somebody's been
on a garage raid.

35:28.950 --> 35:30.550
French fries!!!

35:44.500 --> 35:48.900
<i>If you are at least 18 years old you may
designate a donation of your body or heart[...]</i>

35:48.950 --> 35:51.032
<i>for medical transplanting in case of your death.</i>

35:56.900 --> 35:59.700
If you are looking for fine quality sofas,
look no more.

35:59.800 --> 36:02.200
Today and tomorrow only
with name brand new low prices

36:02.300 --> 36:05.500
you can have the sofa you've been looking for
plus the matching chair

36:05.550 --> 36:07.750
at a price you'd expect to pay
for just a sofa.

36:14.700 --> 36:17.274
Where are you going, kid?
-Get a drink of water.

36:17.800 --> 36:21.749
Here, sit down. Drink this.
Water is no good.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.765
Just here or everywhere?
-Everywhere.

36:24.950 --> 36:27.650
Yeah, you never know
where the toxins are gonna creep in.

36:27.800 --> 36:31.173
My aunt lived in a house that was built
on a hazardous waste dump.

36:31.200 --> 36:35.050
Last April she had a baby and it
was born with no ears.

36:35.200 --> 36:37.578
No ears? Fuck...

36:37.800 --> 36:43.350
Yeah, I know these people who had a baby
that was born with two rows of teeth on top.

36:43.450 --> 36:45.773
Jesus, this seems kind of a monster.

36:46.621 --> 36:51.250
Yeah, just think. By the year 2000
there will be one big chemical wasteland.

36:51.300 --> 36:54.550
Yeah, all contaminated and creepy
with gross, bubbling vines

36:54.600 --> 36:56.050
hanging off the dead trees.

36:56.100 --> 36:58.783
And the mutants will be roaming around
bumping into each other.

36:59.500 --> 37:04.834
Yeah, my dad was in Vietnam and he had some
of that Asian orange crap dumped on 'im.

37:04.950 --> 37:07.700
It had some adverse effects.
-Like what?

37:08.200 --> 37:10.000
Hmm, his fingernails fell out,
loss of sexual appetite and...

37:10.000 --> 37:14.700
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Hmm, his fingernails fell out,
loss of sexual appetite and...

37:14.700 --> 37:15.700
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:15.700 --> 37:17.213
this!
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:17.213 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:22.900 --> 37:24.937
Hey, guess what?
-What?

37:25.100 --> 37:26.500
Chicken butt!

37:30.200 --> 37:34.150
So, I walked in the house and my father,
he threw me down on the living room floor

37:34.200 --> 37:37.900
and held me there. And my mother
cut all my clothes off with the pair of scissors.

37:37.950 --> 37:40.400
And then they made me stand there while
they burned them right in front of me.

37:40.500 --> 37:41.600
You know, I was nude.

37:41.950 --> 37:44.197
Really? All because they didn't like
the way you dress?

37:44.200 --> 37:47.932
Yeah. And I looked just the way I do now.
I don't know what their problem was.

37:48.581 --> 37:51.200
Hey, Jack.
What's with that Sheila girl?

37:52.500 --> 37:54.397
Yeah, she is pretty weird. Why?

37:54.950 --> 37:58.865
I don't know. She bugs me.
She's always staring at me.

37:59.200 --> 38:03.227
She is? I heard she doesn't
even like guys.

38:03.700 --> 38:05.184
What do you mean?
She likes girls?

38:05.250 --> 38:09.094
No, no. I heard she hates sex.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.100
How can anybody hate sex?

38:12.300 --> 38:14.089
You're asking the wrong guy.

38:15.741 --> 38:17.666
She looks so sad all the time.

38:18.300 --> 38:21.700
These poor little
rich bitches always look that way.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.500
Razzle told me she tried to
kill herself a couple of times.

38:24.600 --> 38:27.800
Really?
-Yeah. He asked why.

38:29.700 --> 38:34.336
You know what she said? -What?
-She said: pick a reason.

38:34.600 --> 38:38.000
Hey, Cream, Cheese!
I know this is what you have been waiting for.

38:39.500 --> 38:43.400
Ya, ya. Come here.
Come on. Sit!

38:44.200 --> 38:46.003
Hey, check it out,
they did it!

38:49.000 --> 38:50.300
What?

38:55.264 --> 38:56.964
Chicken butt!

39:12.600 --> 39:14.335
Oh, my god...

39:16.000 --> 39:17.700
I wept.

39:19.300 --> 39:23.581
Count: "1001", "1002".
This makes about two seconds.

39:24.600 --> 39:26.200
Hey, stupid muck!

39:30.000 --> 39:32.750
See what happens
when you get so wiped out?

39:32.900 --> 39:34.800
You gotta stop bringing dope around here.

39:34.850 --> 39:39.579
You're like some old 60's hippy dirt merchant.
-Yeah, groovy, man.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.104
Thanks for helping me out, brother.

39:44.650 --> 39:47.150
You must be a Pisces.

39:49.600 --> 39:52.998
Jeez, this person looks like
a worse driver than me.

39:55.800 --> 39:58.179
My mom's got a car like that.

39:59.300 --> 40:02.200
Vehicle, driven by 35-year-old
Jina Johnson, came...

40:02.400 --> 40:04.126
That IS her car!

40:04.700 --> 40:06.390
Three shoppers were seriously injured

40:06.391 --> 40:08.900
and Mrs. Johnson was booked
on felony drunk drive.

40:09.138 --> 40:10.979
Nice going, mom.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.900
Hey, bike!
Get me a bike!

41:01.000 --> 41:03.000
Do I have to go to school?

41:03.200 --> 41:06.974
No. Not for a while anyways.
-All right!

43:37.900 --> 43:40.890
This is the cool band.
I think the lead singer a real...

43:40.891 --> 43:43.500
Where's the house, Flea?
-Hold on, it's coming, it's coming.

43:43.650 --> 43:48.600
Come on. We've been driving
around for hours... days, weeks.

43:48.650 --> 43:50.500
Hey, my name is Razzle, man.

43:53.300 --> 43:54.810
Oh, there it is!

44:54.600 --> 44:58.534
9 out of 10 Americans would perish
in an all-out nuclear attack.

44:58.535 --> 45:03.600
Not all would die instantly. Many fatalities
would be delayed for days or weeks

45:03.650 --> 45:08.300
until the effects of injuries, burns
and radiation sickness took their toll.

45:08.305 --> 45:13.656
And death from radiation is almost always
excruciatingly painful and prolonged.

45:14.400 --> 45:18.850
Any survivors of an initial onslaught
would be four times more likely

45:18.855 --> 45:23.486
to suffer from leukemia, sterility,
inherited disorders, birth defects

45:23.487 --> 45:26.431
and other conditions
which wreck havoc on living cells.

45:27.400 --> 45:29.750
If you do not live
in a possible target zone

45:29.800 --> 45:33.075
it would seem to be little point
building a blast-proof shelter

45:33.150 --> 45:36.300
because they need to be built
of very expensive materials

45:36.400 --> 45:39.007
and most people
don't have that kind of money.

45:43.400 --> 45:46.215
Tell me now.
-Tell you what?

45:46.800 --> 45:48.588
What happened to your back.

45:51.500 --> 45:56.043
Well... My dad used to beat me all the time.

45:57.400 --> 45:59.779
That's what I thought you were going to say.

46:00.500 --> 46:04.300
You'd think he was crazy.
He would get this look in his eye

46:05.400 --> 46:09.539
and I would know, "Oh-oh... trouble".

46:09.700 --> 46:13.750
He'd wake up in the night
and get touching me all over.

46:17.100 --> 46:21.300
He got all turned on, you know,
and instead of actually raping me

46:21.400 --> 46:25.753
he would stop himself by beating me up.
Does that make any sense?

49:15.700 --> 49:18.700
Hey, where are you going?
Are you all right?

49:51.400 --> 49:54.350
Hey, what does that "T.R." stand for?
"Totally ridiculous"?

49:56.000 --> 49:58.200
Heh, that guy's begging for it.

50:05.900 --> 50:07.366
Come on, fucker.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.632
Hey, there's Skinner.

51:01.300 --> 51:04.072
All right! That's enough of that.

51:05.000 --> 51:06.966
Get away from my house.

51:08.500 --> 51:10.001
Now!

51:57.300 --> 51:58.872
Hey, what was that all about?

51:59.000 --> 52:02.077
Just a couple of assholes
looking for a fight.

52:02.150 --> 52:04.450
Do you think they're
gonna come inside, do you?

52:04.500 --> 52:06.700
No, this isn't their kind of scene.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.600
Yeah, one of those guys had a knife.
-Don't worry about it.

52:09.650 --> 52:12.213
Wimps like that always carry knives.

53:42.500 --> 53:44.299
Oh, shit...

54:02.700 --> 54:06.435
Do I need a stamp to get out of here too?
-Watch it, smartass.

54:07.200 --> 54:11.331
Hey!
You've got a rat on your shoulder.

54:12.400 --> 54:14.950
Take your jacket off, hide the "T.R."
-What for?

54:15.000 --> 54:16.538
We'll tell you later.
Just do it.

54:50.700 --> 54:55.413
Ain't you got finally your turn to sleep in the bed?
-I sure am.

54:56.300 --> 54:58.400
It's kinda like my bed was at home.

54:58.450 --> 55:00.949
But the sheets were cleaner at home.

55:01.600 --> 55:08.079
Ethan? Do you miss your mom?
-Yeah, I kinda do.

55:08.750 --> 55:11.859
But I bet she doesn't miss me.
-Why do you say that?

55:12.700 --> 55:16.981
Because she used to always call me
a pain in the ass. That's why.

55:17.300 --> 55:20.685
Ahh... I bet she didn't mean it.
You're a real good little kid.

55:20.900 --> 55:23.950
All that you do is play all day and
mind your own business, you're sweet.

55:24.000 --> 55:27.672
"Have you hugged YOUR kid today"?
-So fuck off, Razzle.

55:33.500 --> 55:36.538
All right. Where were we?
-"Hansel and Gretel".

55:39.900 --> 55:43.541
In the morning the wicked witch got Hansel
by the hand and carried him to the shed.

55:43.600 --> 55:48.000
She said to Gretel, "You must draw water and
cook something nice for your brother

55:48.050 --> 55:50.665
and when he's fattened up I'll eat him".

55:51.200 --> 55:54.505
"Dear God", Gretel cried,
"I want you to help us".

55:54.900 --> 55:59.993
"Stop your blubbering", said the wicked red-eyed
witch, "it won't do you a bit of good".

56:00.400 --> 56:01.858
Every morning the witch would say,

56:02.100 --> 56:04.672
"Hold out your finger and
let's see if you're getting fat".

56:04.750 --> 56:07.449
"But Hensel held out a chicken bone".

56:13.600 --> 56:17.410
Oh, come on, don't stop.
-But he's asleep.

56:17.600 --> 56:20.695
But we are not.
Read it to us, come on.

56:21.200 --> 56:24.300
Aren't you too old for fairytales?
-Uh-uh.

56:24.400 --> 56:26.000
Please.

56:29.822 --> 56:32.383
Soon the witch got very impatient.

56:33.100 --> 56:35.300
Hold there, Gretel.
Go get water and don't dawdle.

56:35.350 --> 56:38.260
Skinny or fat, I'm gonna cook
your Hensel tomorrow.

57:10.000 --> 57:20.300
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:20.300 --> 57:22.000
See, you hold one hole closed,
you blow real hard
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:24.467
See, you hold one hole closed,
you blow real hard

57:24.500 --> 57:27.146
and all the snot will come
through the other hole.

57:30.500 --> 57:34.459
That a boy! Now you won't get
your shirt sleeve so dirtied.

57:38.800 --> 57:40.800
Could I have some change, mem?

57:44.400 --> 57:47.049
Let God be on your side!

57:52.400 --> 57:56.850
We don't do that anymore.
-I can't help it, I've got a jones.

58:07.300 --> 58:10.341
Yeah, I've been using that
[...] lately.

58:10.400 --> 58:15.000
Hey! Clear out of here.
No loitering allowed.

58:15.700 --> 58:19.137
Oh yeah? And maybe we're doing our shopping.
Ever think of that?

58:19.200 --> 58:23.535
Right, wise guy. Just get the hell out
before I call the police.

58:27.850 --> 58:30.274
What a character...
-Yeah, for sure.

58:30.300 --> 58:31.950
That guy is an asshole.

58:32.300 --> 58:34.943
I saw him selling
PCP to some little kids once.

58:35.100 --> 58:37.202
What a dick...
-Yeah.

58:37.350 --> 58:38.500
What we need is some beer.

58:38.550 --> 58:40.700
Yeah, our nerves are wrecked.

58:41.000 --> 58:45.800
Beer? I hate beer.
-And an ice-cream for Ethan.

58:45.850 --> 58:47.050
All right.

58:47.100 --> 58:50.000
Hey, walk like this.

58:55.500 --> 58:57.306
Nice day, huh?

59:18.600 --> 59:22.500
All right, very funny.
Let's see some ID.

59:24.600 --> 59:27.637
Look, I don't need this.
Don't come back here.

59:28.000 --> 59:29.700
I don't need your business.

59:29.905 --> 59:34.400
Okay. But let me have one of those slushies
over there. And make it a blue one.

59:38.800 --> 59:42.600
All right. That's... 3.23.
-Thanks!

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.372
Happy Easter, asshole.

01:00:22.100 --> 01:00:24.400
Hi!
-Quack-quack. -Bye!

01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:28.661
God damn little bastards!
Came in here and fucked up my store.

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.200
Scum of the earth.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:38.459
See you later.
Put the sock in it.

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.800
And I live over on Heatherton Avenue,
which is a nice neighborhood

01:00:57.850 --> 01:00:59.500
or at least it used to be.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:02.000
Now all you get are these wild teenagers
parading through

01:01:02.016 --> 01:01:02.950
like a bunch of terrorists.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.200
Hear, hear.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:08.012
Yes. The little bastards were
fighting on my front lawn.

01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:11.377
I had to hold them up with the shotgun
while my wife called the police.

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.500
And it took me over an hour to get through.

01:01:13.647 --> 01:01:16.826
Yeah. And that's another thing: the police
ain't doing a god damn thing.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:19.944
Excuse me, reverend Farrell.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.880
Just so happens we have a member of
the police department with us here tonight.

01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:32.834
We have reports of vandalism and robbery
just like any other city.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.200
And we follow up each and every one of them.

01:01:35.250 --> 01:01:37.578
Follow up? You came to my house
three hours later!

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:41.120
Well, we've got a responsibility by law
to adhere to certain procedures.

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.961
Well, while you're going through procedures
people's homes are being ruined by these monsters.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:49.918
Look, I've had to repaint the side wall
of my store five times already.

01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.644
Every time I turn around there is
a "T.R." spray-painted.

01:01:54.850 --> 01:01:56.910
What the hell is "T.R." anyway?

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:04.468
Sandra says there was a stabbing recently
at the club where she was molested.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:07.387
And that those same letters
were left near the weapon.

01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:08.600
In blood.

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.200
Did you investigate that house
like you said you would?

01:02:11.272 --> 01:02:13.311
No, not yet.
-Typical.

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.865
You know, Rennard, I get the feeling
you're not doing your job.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.500
And I get the feeling you're using
innocent people as scapegoat.

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.473
Scapegoat?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.950
We're talking about a bunch of psychos!

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:26.550
Mental rejects running wild on our streets!

01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:28.229
We're talking about kids!

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:30.609
Kids like yours and mine.

01:02:30.644 --> 01:02:32.935
Ha! Oh, I'm damn sure
they ain't my kids.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.500
Gentlemen, please!
Can we be reasonable?

01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:38.200
I know, times are tough and some of
you, people, are up against it.

01:02:38.250 --> 01:02:41.889
Look, Rennard. If the police can't
protect the people,

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.450
then the people have to
protect themselves.

01:02:44.658 --> 01:02:46.364
And take the law in their own hands?

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:48.285
If that's what it comes down to!

01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.100
And use guns to solve your problems?

01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.700
You're damn right!

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:11.042
Okay, mister! Hold it right there.
Identify yourself.

01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:15.696
Hi! I'm Bill. Don't shoot.
Where's Jack?

01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:17.600
Peeling potatoes.

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.846
Perfect.
What are you doing here?

01:03:26.900 --> 01:03:27.931
I need to talk to you.

01:03:28.250 --> 01:03:29.729
Let's go outside then, ok?

01:03:29.850 --> 01:03:31.958
No, I need to talk to all of you.

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:33.727
What for?

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.550
Hi! I'm Jack's father.

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.750
Stepfather.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.332
You're a cop!

01:03:47.700 --> 01:03:50.400
Yes I am, but that's not the reason
why I'm here to talk to you.

01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.200
I hate cops.
To the max.

01:03:53.350 --> 01:03:56.248
Listen. You, kids, are making a pretty bad
reputation for yourselves.

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.385
Last night I was at a meeting and...

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.500
Just let me tell you...

01:04:03.500 --> 01:04:05.290
You got people down on you.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:13.236
What happened?

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.595
Well, you're gonna have to listen up
sooner or later.

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.500
I am not leaving until you do.

01:04:25.850 --> 01:04:28.800
What do I have to do,
for Christ's sake? Pay you?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.200
So, I think it's best for all of you
to go back to your homes

01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:41.585
until this thing blows over.

01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.200
You don't seem to understand.

01:04:43.250 --> 01:04:45.794
Most of us don't have homes to go back to.

01:04:45.850 --> 01:04:49.093
My parents are dopers and the state
won't even let me go home.

01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:51.504
All they do is shove me into foster homes.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.098
Let me tell you,
that sucks big eggs.

01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.171
What do you do here all day?

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.437
Nothing.
-Watch TV.

01:04:59.701 --> 01:05:01.664
Don't you wanna make
anything of yourselves?

01:05:01.665 --> 01:05:02.900
What's the [...]?

01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:06.591
Well, there's families for one thing.
Careers? College?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.226
Families... Everyone knows
families don't work.

01:05:09.350 --> 01:05:12.807
College? Most of us couldn't
afford lunch in high school.

01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:15.400
What do you, kids, do for money?

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.079
Take bribes off cops.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:24.300
Please, mister policeman,
don't make us leave our home.

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.648
We'll be good from now on.
We promise.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.515
Yeah. This is the best home most of us ever had.

01:05:29.650 --> 01:05:32.794
Besides, if we didn't have each other
we wouldn't have anything.

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:38.500
You gonna have to stay out of trouble.

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.000
If you don't, somebody's gonna get hurt.

01:05:41.550 --> 01:05:44.928
Everybody's got guns these days
and they are just itching to use them.

01:05:45.500 --> 01:05:46.800
<i>Do you understand?</i>

01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:49.840
<i>Let this be the last time I hear of T.R.</i>

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:57.483
"Let this be the last time I hear of T.R."

01:05:57.550 --> 01:05:59.851
Maybe we should get guns too.

01:05:59.900 --> 01:06:01.768
I already have a gun.

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:04.731
Let's just move some place else.
-My old man's a shotgun.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:10.300
Come on. Don't get so worried.
Everything will be all right.

01:06:10.350 --> 01:06:12.751
<i>I know I can get a forty-five,
but I have to steal it.</i>

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.353
Let's go to Frisco!

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.800
What a pigsty!

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:17.534
Jesus Ch-rist!

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:25.041
At least they got good taste in women.

01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:45.820
Sit down!

01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:49.497
See that? See it?

01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:53.222
What do you want?

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:55.921
We want to let you know
we are sick of your shit.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.904
This is what you might call
a warning.

01:07:57.905 --> 01:08:01.176
If there's any more trouble from you,
creeps, some heads are gonna roll.

01:08:03.200 --> 01:08:04.691
You dirty whore!

01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.500
You get the message?

01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:12.060
Next time we'll do more
than tear up somebody's shirt.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.087
<i>Holy fuck.</i>

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.000
You know what I was thinking?

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.620
No, what was you thinking?

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.194
Has anybody seen my shirt?

01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:38.800
Yeah, you're wearing it.

01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:41.383
Not this shirt, asshole.
My yellow shirt.

01:08:41.649 --> 01:08:44.202
If somebody took that shirt
I'll knock their fucking teeth out.

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:47.916
Who will want that shirt.
-Don't call me an asshole.

01:08:48.381 --> 01:08:51.026
Well, where is it then?
-What the hell is wrong with you?

01:08:51.850 --> 01:08:54.635
Can't find my fucking shirt,
can't you hear?

01:08:55.661 --> 01:08:58.183
And I can't find my fucking dope.

01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:00.800
This is not where I had it.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:05.026
I know you. You were probably
too twisted to remember where you put it.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:09.371
I remember distinctedly.
-Distinctly.

01:09:10.050 --> 01:09:15.374
Whatever. I had a jar of
25 black triangles in it.

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:18.712
Put them in my sleeping bag
down by my feet.

01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.749
And now they're gone.

01:09:20.899 --> 01:09:24.803
All I know is I go to all the trouble
putting nails up all over the place

01:09:24.850 --> 01:09:28.947
to keep things organized and now
I can't find my god damned shirt.

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.768
My sentiment precisely.

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:50.283
Hey! Open this door!

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.483
Open this door right now!

01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:09.550
Sheila?

01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:04.200
What's going on?

01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:09.655
You and your stupid dope!
That's what I think of your dope.

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.150
What are you doing?

01:11:17.785 --> 01:11:20.292
Man, what did you do that for?

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:22.800
It's crazy!

01:11:24.270 --> 01:11:25.446
Sheila's dead.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.850
That's what happened to your stupid dope!

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.600
What?
-Sheila's dead.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.900
Go ahead, read it.

01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:26.766
To my friends.
Don't be mad at me for doing this.

01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:29.400
But I really don't wanna
stick around any longer.

01:12:30.050 --> 01:12:31.150
I'm sorry.

01:12:31.900 --> 01:12:34.300
I hope all of you have fun with your lives.

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:38.600
The time I've lived with you was
the best part of my life. Thanks.

01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:42.234
I love you all, especially Joe.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.145
Gone forever, Sheila.

01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:49.677
P.S.: I hope you don't have to move.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.043
Huh, that's funny.
"I hope you don't have to move".

01:13:03.200 --> 01:13:04.950
Did you hear something out there?

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.443
No, Ethan, just sit down and
be quiet for a while.

01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:14.700
So, what are we gonna do?

01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.700
I think we all should decide.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.877
Ain't you supposed to call the police
when somebody dies?

01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.206
Great. And that's just what we need.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.231
What about the coroner?

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.700
We do that and they'll
call the police.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.538
Right. And then they'll probably
gonna try and blame it on us.

01:13:30.181 --> 01:13:31.899
Don't you think we should let
her parents know?

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:34.200
God damn it, Keef, man,
if it wasn't for you

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.420
none of this shit
would happen in the first place.

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.350
I always knew something
because of it happens.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:39.572
Some friend you are.

01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.650
He's just a choking fucking druggy.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:43.400
Why don't you just leave him alone?
-Why don't you shut up?

01:13:43.450 --> 01:13:46.140
Keef is our friend too,
you don't have to rag on him.

01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:51.650
Wait a minute.

01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:55.100
Just take her home.

01:13:56.450 --> 01:13:57.650
Do what?

01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.481
Let's just take her home.

01:14:01.700 --> 01:14:03.850
Yeah. When Sindy Bartholomew o.d.-ed

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:06.400
her friends put her on the front seat
of her mother's car.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:09.400
Well, that's pretty crappy.
We are not gonna do that.

01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:14.500
I know where Sheila's parents live.
We could just bring her home.

01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:30.800
Yes?

01:14:31.250 --> 01:14:32.800
Are you Sheila's father?

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600
Yes, I am.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:38.650
Well. Sorry to tell you this, but...
she killed herself.

01:14:41.450 --> 01:14:42.900
What is this? A joke?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.332
No, it's not.

01:14:47.000 --> 01:14:49.500
Please, take her.
We didn't know what else to do.

01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:53.900
We'd like to go to the funeral.
If you don't mind.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.732
Oh, god...

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.150
I'm sorry, but the mother requests
that you leave.

01:16:35.383 --> 01:16:36.583
All of you.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:38.966
Leave? How come?

01:16:39.774 --> 01:16:41.286
Please, just do as we ask.

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.100
Mother is really very upset.

01:16:43.101 --> 01:16:45.501
We aren't feeling that great either.
Believe me.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:46.840
We understand.

01:16:46.900 --> 01:16:48.500
Good. Then will you leave?

01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.481
The mother really doesn't want you here.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.000
Neither do I.

01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:57.696
But we don't wanna to leave.

01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:00.095
But you have to.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.000
I mean, look at you.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:05.256
We didn't have any nice clothes to wear.
We're sorry.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:09.745
Will you please show
these young people out?

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:13.089
Why don't you just visit the grave
after we'd left?

01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.520
Or maybe tomorrow.

01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.782
Sheila was our friend. And we have
every right to be here if we want to.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:20.763
We're staying right here.
-No, you are not.

01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:22.650
We're sitting all the way in the back here.

01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:23.850
Can't you just ignore us?

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.420
No, we can't ignore you!

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:27.016
We don't want you here.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:31.332
We didn't like you when Sheila was alive
and we don't like you now.

01:17:32.100 --> 01:17:34.250
If it wasn't for you
she'd probably still be alive.

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:37.599
No, asshole, if it wasn't for YOU,
she'd still be alive.

01:17:37.900 --> 01:17:39.850
Don't you say that, you don't
know anything about us.

01:17:39.900 --> 01:17:42.043
Yes, I do. Sheila told me all about you.

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.000
She told me how you couldn't
keep your hands off her.

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:45.032
You shut up!

01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:47.250
You molested your own
daughter, you scumback,

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.679
and then you beat her -
she showed me the scars.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.046
You're a fucking asshole,
you know that?

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:51.217
Hey you, T.R.! -Me?
-Yeah, you. Come here!

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:58.585
Where's Jack?
-Inside, I guess.

01:19:59.050 --> 01:20:03.130
Go in there and find him. And tell him
to get his ass out here RIGHT NOW.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:21:07.100 --> 01:21:08.900
Yeah?
-Don't "yeah" at me.

01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:10.750
And don't come up with
no fucking attitude

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.300
after what you've pulled.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:16.106
We went to our friend's funeral, all right?
Big deal.

01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:18.500
And beat the shit out of
your friend's father!

01:21:18.750 --> 01:21:20.950
He's in the hospital,
in case you didn't know.

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:24.000
You can't piss off people
the way you do, Jack.

01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.212
This time you've bit off more
than you can chew.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:27.644
Somebody's gonna stop you.

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:30.680
Personally I'd like to see
all of you in jail for a while.

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:33.250
Yeah, "book 'em Danno".

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.200
I am not gonna arrest you.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:37.318
But I DO want you out of that house.

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:39.550
If you don't leave
somebody's gonna get hurt.

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.845
I want you out tonight!

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.600
What?
-No way.

01:21:43.650 --> 01:21:44.956
You can forget it.

01:21:44.957 --> 01:21:46.088
Where are we supposed to go?

01:21:46.123 --> 01:21:49.000
Anywhere!
Just get out of that place.

01:21:49.450 --> 01:21:52.200
If these people can't find you,
they can't hurt you.

01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:53.681
I want you to tell your friends

01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.150
to get out of there and
pack up their things TONIGHT.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.650
It's for your own good.

01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:02.600
I'll be out there in a few hours
and make sure that you're gone.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.100
Hey.

01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:16.545
You could come home, you know.
Your mother would like that.

01:23:12.300 --> 01:23:14.200
I like your personality.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:49.168
Here.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:24:01.066
So, do you feel anything?
-Aha, I feel kinda scared.

01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:03.266
Oh, you shouldn't.

01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:11.508
Hey.
Ain't nothing worth saving in here.

01:24:11.543 --> 01:24:12.398
Yeah, but...

01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:15.521
Don't you think we really gonna
trash this place before we leave?

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:19.023
Trash it?

01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:29.226
This is so-o fucked,
I can't believe it!

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.985
So, what are you gonna do?

01:24:41.500 --> 01:24:43.042
Go back home, I guess.

01:24:43.600 --> 01:24:45.009
Fag city.

01:24:46.450 --> 01:24:48.750
What about you?
-I don't know.

01:24:53.250 --> 01:24:56.193
All right, I've got it!
Here's what we're gonna do.

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:57.710
Check it out.

01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.764
I'm gonna go syphon
some gas out of your car.

01:25:01.100 --> 01:25:03.386
Then when we get ready to leave -
right before we leave -

01:25:03.500 --> 01:25:07.820
we'll set the whole place on fire.
Boom!

01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:10.099
Will be fun to watch it burn.

01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:13.150
What do you think?
-Whatever.

01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.666
Here you are.
-Hey, buddy, what's happening?

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:39.500
Sit down. This is great.

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:41.400
I've been looking all over for you.

01:25:42.000 --> 01:25:44.396
Your wife doesn't even know where you are.
-So?

01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:48.029
Come here I wanna talk to you.
Over here.

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.868
Do you know what happened?
-No, what?

01:26:00.903 --> 01:26:02.950
Hi...
-I don't wanna anything, thanks.

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.900
Give him a scotch, Marox.

01:26:05.850 --> 01:26:07.850
They buried one of those kids today.

01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:10.450
A 16-year-old girl.
-Really?

01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:12.200
O.D.?
-I don't know.

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.700
Were you ready for this:

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:17.355
those kids busted in and
raided a funeral home.

01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:19.900
They tore the place apart.

01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.300
Are you shitting me?

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:50.400
Wait a minute.

01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.600
What the fuck are we doing?

01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:54.442
I don't know about you,

01:26:54.450 --> 01:26:57.842
but there's no way anyone's
gonna make ME leave this place.

01:26:57.900 --> 01:27:00.887
Uh-uh, wake up
and smell the coffee, man.

01:27:01.472 --> 01:27:02.653
It's hopeless.

01:27:02.688 --> 01:27:04.430
Your old man only wants us to leave

01:27:04.450 --> 01:27:07.118
because he doesn't think
we can take care of ourselves.

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.696
That's bullshit.

01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:10.850
We're smarter than those assholes.

01:27:10.900 --> 01:27:13.403
Yeah, seems like if they
run us out of this place

01:27:13.405 --> 01:27:15.752
the others will run us out of
the next place we'll find.

01:27:15.850 --> 01:27:17.497
My old man's coming back later

01:27:17.500 --> 01:27:20.545
and if we're still here
he's gonna shit Twinkies.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.001
Can you imagine how
that girl's mother felt?

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:28.400
Her only daughter's up there in a box

01:27:28.650 --> 01:27:30.523
and those son-of-a-bitches come in

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:34.014
wreck the place and
than brutalize the family.

01:27:34.775 --> 01:27:36.630
Un-be-lie-vable.

01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:40.891
I mean, I am not religious.
But if you ask me...

01:27:40.900 --> 01:27:42.462
that's downright simple.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:47.800
Well, Jack, what's it gonna be?

01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:55.850
We've got a match?
Any match?

01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:59.848
Save it, Razzle.
We're staying.

01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:01.950
Staying?

01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.818
Yeah, we're not leaving this place
without a fight.

01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.300
Shit.

01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.000
We're gonna have to go back
out there.

01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:17.600
That's what I was thinking.

01:31:24.700 --> 01:31:27.089
Hasta luego, shitface!
