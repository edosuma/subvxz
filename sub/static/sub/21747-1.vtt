00:00.010 --> 00:01.370
- Adam!
- What?

00:01.420 --> 00:02.810
- It's started.
- What?

00:03.360 --> 00:03.950
What?

00:04.500 --> 00:06.210
It's too soon!

00:06.260 --> 00:08.250
- Shit!
- Aaah. Oh!

00:08.300 --> 00:09.690
Shit.

00:09.740 --> 00:11.040
Oh!

00:15.500 --> 00:17.610
Excuse me! Out of the
way, please. Thank you.

00:17.660 --> 00:19.650
Take her straight into theatre.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.810
Stay with me, please.

00:21.860 --> 00:23.860
It's OK. It's OK.

00:27.540 --> 00:31.930
- 10ml of phenobarbital. - The baby's
heartbeat is weakening. - Quickly, please.

Uhhh-hhh-hhh!

01:43.500 --> 01:45.490
You were thrashing.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.740
I just had the weirdest dream.

01:55.220 --> 01:57.010
What do you think it means?

01:57.060 --> 01:59.140
I don't know. Maybe you want a puppy?

02:03.140 --> 02:05.140
You can read too much into dreams.

02:07.500 --> 02:09.690
- I'll give you a lift
once I'm changed. - Great.

02:09.740 --> 02:12.450
- Oh, good luck. - Thanks.
- Good luck? What for?

02:12.500 --> 02:16.650
- Interview. New job. - I didn't know you were
looking. - I wasn't. I was head-hunted. - Mm.

02:16.700 --> 02:19.090
Ah, that used to happen to me.

02:19.140 --> 02:21.140
A long time ago.

02:23.940 --> 02:25.940
Good luck.

02:44.140 --> 02:47.020
OK. You all right? Come
on. We'll put you in.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.930
Oh ho-ho-ho!

02:53.680 --> 02:54.780
In you go.

02:57.380 --> 02:59.380
Aw!

03:00.580 --> 03:02.570
Oh, he's fine.

03:04.700 --> 03:07.460
Uhhh-hhh! Shit!

03:10.180 --> 03:11.780
Shit.

03:26.620 --> 03:30.770
So, erm, the young woman who rang
me said I'd be meeting the CEO.

03:30.820 --> 03:32.410
- I did.
- That was you?

03:32.460 --> 03:34.450
- And you are. I mean, I am.
- What?

03:34.500 --> 03:37.290
- The CEO. - Oh, right.
Ah, this has started well.

03:37.340 --> 03:40.130
It would have started even
better if you'd been here on time.

03:40.180 --> 03:41.770
Yes, I'm sorry.

03:41.820 --> 03:43.810
My team are waiting for us.

03:43.860 --> 03:46.180
- In the tree house.
- Tree house?

03:47.380 --> 03:49.530
- Go viral.
- Go viral!

03:49.580 --> 03:51.930
Excellent.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.580
Marsden House publishing.
How may I direct your call?

03:57.580 --> 03:59.170
One moment please.

03:59.220 --> 04:01.730
Is necessary I say that?
It's just you and me.

04:01.780 --> 04:03.900
It just sounds more professional, Ramona.

04:05.140 --> 04:06.740
Who is it?

04:07.820 --> 04:09.970
Who is this, please?

04:10.020 --> 04:12.220
Hello? Hello?

04:13.220 --> 04:14.660
They call back.

04:15.940 --> 04:18.410
Your book launch tonight.
Can I invite a friend?

04:18.459 --> 04:20.250
- No.
- Oh.

04:20.300 --> 04:22.530
One. But they can't eat or drink.

04:22.580 --> 04:26.010
- God, what's the point? - To support
your mother. - Marsden House Publishing.

04:26.060 --> 04:30.250
- How may I direct your call?
- We'll be there. Early. To help you set up.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.530
I suppose there's no chance of a lift?

04:32.580 --> 04:34.460
Is your distributor.

04:36.620 --> 04:38.020
Hello.

04:39.180 --> 04:40.860
Hello?

04:42.340 --> 04:44.740
Hello? Hello?

04:45.980 --> 04:48.490
What a lovely house you have, Mrs O'Neil.

04:48.540 --> 04:51.530
- It's very characterful.
- Oh, well, it's home to me.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.170
- And you'd like to stay in it, I understand.
- Er, milk, Mr Marsden?

04:55.220 --> 04:57.210
David. Yes, please. Thank you.

04:57.260 --> 04:58.530
Er...

04:58.580 --> 05:00.170
Oh, that's plenty.

05:00.220 --> 05:01.660
Thank you.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.450
Perfect.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.530
- Oh, is that the pen? - I'm
sorry? - In your briefcase.

05:07.580 --> 05:10.890
The advert said I'd get a free pen
just for arranging an appointment.

05:10.940 --> 05:13.130
Oh, yes. Yes, of course.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.180
Thank you.

05:17.020 --> 05:19.020
Oh, nice.

05:21.340 --> 05:22.970
Oh.

05:23.020 --> 05:26.500
- You are interested in equity release?
- I don't know. What is it?

05:27.740 --> 05:29.730
Well, it's a way of borrowing money

05:29.780 --> 05:33.290
against the value of your home,
while continuing to live in it.

05:33.340 --> 05:35.530
I don't own this house.

05:35.580 --> 05:38.180
- You don't?
- No. It belongs to my son.

05:42.140 --> 05:44.330
Well, you're not leaving, are you?

05:44.380 --> 05:47.770
- There's really no point my being here.
- Oh, well, finish your tea at least.

05:47.820 --> 05:50.140
I can go whole days without seeing anyone.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.170
Thank you.

05:55.220 --> 05:56.500
Ohh...

05:57.860 --> 05:59.290
So, David,

05:59.340 --> 06:01.850
you seem very intelligent,

06:01.900 --> 06:04.980
why are you going door-to-door
selling dodgy loans?

06:06.060 --> 06:08.650
I thought she was the sad
one, but she pitied me.

06:08.700 --> 06:13.010
And she was right to. 50 years ago, I'd have
been flogging dusters and encyclopaedias.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.290
Come on, David. We've all
got to make a living.

06:15.340 --> 06:19.130
Yeah, but when your reputation's trashed
and no respectable firm will touch you

06:19.180 --> 06:22.180
you're reduced to using cheap
pens as bait to lure old ladies.

06:22.560 --> 06:23.510
Sorry!

06:24.060 --> 06:24.750
Hi.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.290
- Ohh!
- Have you joined a boyband?

06:27.340 --> 06:30.260
- Don't. It's a long story.
- How was the job interview?

06:34.020 --> 06:38.490
Well, I think we'd all agree
your CV is very impressive.

06:38.540 --> 06:40.320
Longer than yours, I'd guess.

06:43.460 --> 06:48.530
- They were all children? - No, they
were bloody young. None of them
looked like they'd started shaving.

06:48.580 --> 06:53.170
So what we do is match consumers with designers,
based on the preferences they've expressed.

06:53.220 --> 06:56.490
Like a personal shopper finding the
fashions that best suit your taste.

06:56.540 --> 06:57.980
Like Thread?

06:59.380 --> 07:01.450
They are one of our main competitors.

07:01.500 --> 07:03.770
- We tend not to mention
their name. - Right.

07:03.820 --> 07:05.410
Said Thread.

07:07.220 --> 07:09.220
Before your time.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.130
So you blew it, then?

07:13.180 --> 07:16.570
You would have thought that, but no,
they seemed to like my sense of style.

07:16.620 --> 07:18.370
We'll be in touch.

07:18.420 --> 07:20.300
With an offer.

07:28.540 --> 07:30.540
- [Champagne?]
- [No, thank you.]

07:36.000 --> 07:38.170
Thank you so much for coming.

07:38.220 --> 07:41.330
Ah, your first book! Aww!

07:41.380 --> 07:44.020
Congratulations, Karen.
You must be so proud.

07:45.020 --> 07:46.490
Thank you, David.

07:46.540 --> 07:48.130
You're wearing the dress!

07:48.180 --> 07:51.050
- Tina took me shopping.
- I told you you'd look great in it.

07:51.100 --> 07:52.730
Yeah, yeah, you do.

07:52.780 --> 07:56.530
- I'd have said the same thing
if they'd invited me. - Sssh.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.730
I love the, uh, the swimming-baths theme.

07:58.780 --> 08:02.850
- Might drown the company if Bridie's book
doesn't do well. - Ah, it'll be a bestseller.

08:02.900 --> 08:06.210
Says the man who thinks Wayne
Rooney's autobiography is literature.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.060
- I'd better go and say something.
- That is a cracking read.

08:09.440 --> 08:10.630
Wayne can write.

08:11.180 --> 08:12.570
Oh. Hello.

08:12.620 --> 08:17.180
"Mr Williams? Huxtons. We have a couple
very interested in renting your property."

08:27.820 --> 08:29.410
Caught you.

08:29.460 --> 08:31.450
Ah, she's a beautiful girl, son.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.450
- Here, big man. - What? - So, er, I
think I've got someone for my house.

08:34.500 --> 08:37.370
- Haven't you rented it yet?
- No, sure, I've been doing it up.

08:37.419 --> 08:40.169
Anyway, I've got a viewing
tomorrow, an executive let.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.970
Why don't you just move in and live in it?

08:43.020 --> 08:46.690
- Because that would take me
too far away from Tina. - Mm.

08:46.740 --> 08:51.010
- And, besides, he pays me half of what
he'll earn in rent. - That's not a factor.

08:51.060 --> 08:53.290
- Yes, it is. - I see.
- Oh, it's a good day.

08:53.340 --> 08:55.940
The house, the job, a
teenage son who's happy.

08:58.460 --> 09:02.530
- And a beautiful woman who wants to share my
bed. - Oh? You've not mentioned her to me before.

09:02.580 --> 09:04.050
Oh, I didn't want to upset you.

09:04.100 --> 09:08.170
- I tell you what, I am gonna get the
hang of this life thing. - Don't worry.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.620
You'll screw it up like you usually do.

09:12.020 --> 09:14.020
- Thank you. - A pleasure. - Aw.

09:18.500 --> 09:20.090
Hi, everyone.

09:20.140 --> 09:22.810
I'd just like to take a
moment to welcome you all

09:22.860 --> 09:27.490
to this celebration of the first book
to come out of Marsden House Publishing.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.770
Thank you. Thank you.

09:31.820 --> 09:35.430
I need to thank a woman without
whom I wouldn't be here tonight.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.610
(I think that's me.)

09:36.660 --> 09:40.970
She's already tipped to be the voice
of her generation -- by me, anyway.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.610
Remember her name, you'll
be hearing it a lot.

09:43.660 --> 09:47.530
Author of The Deep End,
Miss Bridie Sellers.

09:50.940 --> 09:52.930
Come on, Bridie!

09:52.980 --> 09:54.780
Well done, Bridie!

10:01.420 --> 10:06.010
- We'll have to buy a copy, won't we?
- There's no such thing as a free drink.

10:06.060 --> 10:08.290
Oh, you must be pleased for her,

10:08.340 --> 10:11.410
but I'm sure you'd have
loved to be a part of it all.

10:11.460 --> 10:14.140
If I'm honest, I do
rather envy her success.

10:15.500 --> 10:18.610
Mm, me, too. I'd love to
have run my own business, me.

10:18.660 --> 10:20.050
Ah, you don't know, Jen.

10:20.100 --> 10:23.090
- Might still happen.
- Oh, next life, maybe.

10:23.140 --> 10:25.650
At least you have a job you enjoy.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.170
Hm.

10:28.820 --> 10:31.210
Yay!

10:31.260 --> 10:32.850
A great success!

10:32.900 --> 10:36.330
- Yeah, I got the author to sign mine.
- Oh, let's have a look. - There.

10:36.380 --> 10:40.250
- Spelt Jenny with an 'I'!
- Just careful, mind the spine.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.290
- Can you give me a hand?
- Oh, yeah.

10:42.340 --> 10:46.210
- Erm, I'll do it. - Shall we go and
listen to some music or something?

10:46.260 --> 10:48.410
Oh, I'm sorry, are we boring you?

10:48.460 --> 10:53.090
- Are they going upstairs? - Well, I very
much doubt they're going to help, David.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.810
Oh, I remember when I was
that age. I was just the same.

10:55.860 --> 10:58.810
- Like father, like son, eh?
- That's what worries me.

10:58.860 --> 11:00.450
Relax. Here, big man.

11:00.500 --> 11:03.530
So, Adam, I hear you're
letting your house.

11:03.580 --> 11:05.890
Erm, yeah, well, I've got a, a, a viewing.

11:05.940 --> 11:08.010
Just a young couple expecting a baby.

11:08.060 --> 11:11.050
- I'm sure they'll take it.
It's very beautiful. - Thank you.

11:11.100 --> 11:14.490
- Oh, had a nose around? - No. The
interior designer gave me a guided tour.

11:14.540 --> 11:15.930
Aw, thanks, David.

11:15.980 --> 11:20.530
Adam's brief was not to spend too
much money, but I wanted it to be
somewhere I'd be happy to live.

11:20.580 --> 11:22.450
- Would you be?
- Yeah.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.490
You never said that.

11:24.540 --> 11:26.810
- Food! - Ooh, I'm
famished. - Here we go.

11:26.860 --> 11:28.450
I'm starving!

11:28.500 --> 11:30.290
Er, ladies and gentlemen,

11:30.340 --> 11:32.370
I am going to say a few words.

11:32.420 --> 11:33.990
Oh, God, must you?

11:34.740 --> 11:39.450
Just a toast, really, just to celebrate
Karen's magnificent achievement.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.610
It was nothing, I just went to Waitrose.

11:41.660 --> 11:45.170
- Oh, is that why I saw those Aldi
bags stashed in the kitchen? - Cow.

11:45.220 --> 11:51.230
Well, I'm sure the catering will be better, one
day, to celebrate this winning the Booker Prize!

11:52.820 --> 11:54.310
To Karen!

11:54.960 --> 11:56.580
- No more.
- Yeah.

11:59.380 --> 12:01.290
I think she's got a temperature.

12:01.340 --> 12:03.290
- Shall we take her to the doctor's?
- Can you?

12:03.340 --> 12:07.730
- Oh, Jen, I ducked out of work yesterday.
- I just can't take the time off.

12:07.780 --> 12:11.260
I'll be fine. I just need to rest.
I've got my phone if I need you.

12:13.740 --> 12:15.690
She's not that hot.

12:15.740 --> 12:17.730
I just want to go back to sleep.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.570
All right, sweetheart.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.820
But if you start feeling sick,
will you call one of us. Yeah?

12:25.060 --> 12:27.060
Try your dad first.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.010
Come in. Come in.

12:42.060 --> 12:44.530
Well, I got your message.
What's so urgent?

12:46.060 --> 12:49.770
Oh, you spoke to the estate agent.
I thought the viewing went well.

12:49.820 --> 12:51.930
It did. It did. But, then we had a chat.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.570
- Oh.
- And, well,

12:53.620 --> 12:55.610
here's the thing.

12:55.660 --> 12:57.650
They're not gonna take the house.

12:57.700 --> 12:59.290
What?

12:59.340 --> 13:01.450
- They seemed dead keen.
- I know. I know.

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
I heard her. I was here, but erm...

13:04.580 --> 13:06.170
.. it got me thinking.

13:06.220 --> 13:10.930
You know, when we first started seeing each
other, we agreed to take things slowly.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.810
- Living across the hall from each other.
- Yeah, one day at a time.

13:13.860 --> 13:16.450
Yeah, well, that was nine
months ago. You know?

13:16.500 --> 13:19.900
273 days at a time to be precise.

13:20.980 --> 13:27.420
So I thought that maybe it's time
to take this to the next level.

13:38.640 --> 13:41.550
- Congratulations.
- If you ask me, it's not before time.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.630
I know. I can't think
why I didn't ask sooner.

13:43.680 --> 13:46.980
- Clearly it went well. - Oh, man, you
should've seen the look on her face.

13:50.440 --> 13:51.870
It's a key.

13:52.720 --> 13:53.490
Yeah.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.920
To this house.

13:58.800 --> 14:04.110
You know, I was crazy thinking I
was gonna rent it out. We should
be living here -- you, me and Matt.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.150
I thought it was an engagement ring.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.230
What!? Wha... Oh. Oh, the box.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.390
Yeah. Er, no, sorry.
Sorry. Are you disappointed?

14:11.440 --> 14:14.910
- No. - What? So you
will move in with us?

14:14.960 --> 14:17.030
- So you DON'T want
to get married? - No!

14:17.080 --> 14:19.600
- Oh, then yes! Yes! Yes!
- Oh!

14:25.440 --> 14:27.870
I was just so relieved, I
said it without thinking.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.960
- Now you wish you hadn't?
- In the next breath, I wished I hadn't.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.750
What if it doesn't work out, Karen?

14:34.800 --> 14:37.070
We couldn't go back to the way we were.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.550
I don't want to lose him.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.590
Whoo-ooh!

14:41.640 --> 14:45.350
Don't tell Jen. You might
as well be telling Adam.

14:45.400 --> 14:48.070
- Hi. - Hiya. - Sorry I'm late.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.110
What were you two talking about?

14:50.160 --> 14:54.550
- Oh, we weren't.
- Yeah, you were. I saw your lips moving.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.720
Nothing interesting.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.470
Well, it might be. Try me.

14:59.520 --> 15:02.230
Honestly, how are things with you?

15:02.280 --> 15:03.750
Oh, shite.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.630
Work's shite. Kids are shite.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.430
Oh, Chloe's up to something.

15:07.480 --> 15:10.040
Anyway, you don't want
me bringing you down.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.270
Er, listen, I'll just get myself a drink.

15:13.320 --> 15:15.600
- Do you want anything? - No,
thanks. - I'm good. - OK.

15:25.840 --> 15:29.030
I can't imagine ever setting
up house with someone again.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.950
- You mean you can't imagine
who'd do it with you. - No.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.590
Well, yeah.

15:33.640 --> 15:35.910
But, no, I mean, getting that far.

15:35.960 --> 15:38.950
Having to wade through
all that dating nonsense.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.390
Oh, I know what you mean. When
you're younger, dating, courting,

15:42.440 --> 15:44.150
it's like a voyage of discovery.

15:44.200 --> 15:47.310
When you're older, it's like a ride
on the Belfast-Liverpool ferry.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.680
But not when you meet the right person.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.950
Does Matthew know you're moving?

15:53.000 --> 15:55.630
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I checked with
him before I asked Tina. - Oh.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.510
Didsbury?

15:57.560 --> 16:00.510
- That's where you lived with Mum.
- Yeah, when you were born.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.190
It'll be like coming home. Well,
that's the plan. Our own home.

16:04.240 --> 16:05.950
Yours and mine.

16:06.000 --> 16:07.390
With...

16:07.440 --> 16:09.430
Tina, if that's OK with you.

16:09.480 --> 16:10.950
I like Tina.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.190
You like each other, I can tell.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.590
Listen, I know Didsbury is not
the centre of the universe --

16:16.640 --> 16:18.270
It's not the centre of town.

16:18.720 --> 16:20.310
But, yeah, I mean...

16:20.360 --> 16:23.350
You've got loads of friends
that live out that way.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.990
Olivia, too.

16:26.040 --> 16:28.800
Well, er, will she be
allowed to stay over?

16:30.480 --> 16:31.950
Er, well...

16:32.000 --> 16:33.990
I'd have to discuss that with Karen.

16:34.040 --> 16:36.440
- Not David.
- No. No, no, no.

16:37.520 --> 16:40.630
Look, if Karen's cool with
it, I wouldn't have an issue.

16:40.680 --> 16:42.870
Adam, what about me?

16:42.920 --> 16:44.510
- I got you one.
- Hm?

16:44.560 --> 16:46.150
No, I mean, I mean...

16:46.200 --> 16:49.070
If you're moving out, what's
going to happen to me?

16:49.120 --> 16:51.910
Oh, bollocks, er... I
hadn't thought about that.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.950
Could you afford the rent?

16:54.000 --> 16:55.470
Not now.

16:55.520 --> 17:00.710
Well, you were only supposed to be staying for a
couple of weeks until you got yourself sorted.

17:00.760 --> 17:02.560
I thought I had.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.829
I can't move in with him.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.950
But I can't not move in with him,

17:08.000 --> 17:10.589
because now I've told him that I will.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.829
- Don't say anything
to him, will you? - No.

17:12.880 --> 17:15.160
You've got to do that. And soon.

17:17.520 --> 17:22.030
- Ohh! Right, same again? Or shall we get
something to eat? - I'm sorry, Jen. I've got
to go.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.069
- Yeah, me, too. - Hey? - I've got
a stack of emails I need to answer.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.230
I'm sorry. I've got to
go and talk to Adam.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.270
- We said we'd catch a movie next week.
- Great, I'm up for that.

17:30.320 --> 17:31.910
- See you. - Bye. - OK.

17:31.960 --> 17:33.360
Don't forget.

17:43.760 --> 17:46.230
Adam, please don't look at me like that.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.760
How am I supposed to look? Happy?

17:50.680 --> 17:53.670
Like you did when I gave you
the key? Why did you do that?

17:53.720 --> 17:57.800
I just can't bear to leave this place.
You can understand that, can't you?

18:00.720 --> 18:02.720
It's where you lived with Liam.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.120
That's not it.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.640
I left after Rachel died. You stayed.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.710
You could too,

18:14.760 --> 18:16.760
across the hall.

18:18.400 --> 18:21.070
No. No, no. No, no, no,
no. Matt and I are moving.

18:21.120 --> 18:23.120
He wants to. You said you did.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.800
I know.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.560
Sorry.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.880
So you're not going to
claim that I misheard you?

18:38.120 --> 18:40.000

18:51.560 --> 18:53.630
Oh, no.

18:53.680 --> 18:55.670
I said, 'I love unicorns.'

18:55.720 --> 18:57.430
What?

18:57.480 --> 19:00.310

I was a little girl.

19:00.360 --> 19:03.040

19:04.760 --> 19:07.550
- You just said you love me.
- I thought you'd said it to me.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.560

I've just dropped one of my

- But David's not typical.
- He's trustworthy?

21:00.800 --> 21:03.230
Well, he did serve time for fraud.

21:03.280 --> 21:05.710
- I'm joking. He got off.
- That's a recommendation.

21:05.760 --> 21:08.110
- I should have a word with him.
- Invite your friends.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.760
- If they're anything like you.
- You mean 'loaded'?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.760

Do you think your friend
would be interested?

21:22.680 --> 21:24.470
Oh, Pete, you're a star!

25:01.100 --> 25:03.290
Sorry. Er... Let... Let me translate.

25:03.340 --> 25:05.810
Er, 'high net worth individuals'...

25:06.060 --> 25:08.060
.. also known as...

25:09.220 --> 25:11.020
That's more like it!

25:18.020 --> 25:21.020
Is it just me or does that
remind you of something?

25:22.020 --> 25:23.730
Vagina Dentata.

25:23.780 --> 25:28.170
- Eh? - Freud, I think. The fear of some
men that women have teeth down there.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.850
Ohh.

25:29.900 --> 25:31.690
'Vagina Dentata.'

25:31.740 --> 25:34.010
Sounds like 'Hakuna Matata', doesn't it?

25:34.060 --> 25:36.460
Well, that's just ruined
The Lion King for me.

25:37.620 --> 25:38.930
Ah, there you are.

25:38.980 --> 25:41.290
Jen? Jen, don't you want a word with him?

25:41.340 --> 25:42.570
Hey?

25:42.620 --> 25:45.570
Oh, yes, I do. He's been avoiding me.

25:45.620 --> 25:48.850
Probably scared that your
bite's worse than your bark.

25:48.900 --> 25:50.490
Hm, well, he's about to find out.

25:50.540 --> 25:51.810
Woof!

25:51.860 --> 25:53.450
I've got to hand it to you, David.

25:53.500 --> 25:57.210
The WAGs usually only get this excited
when there are paparazzi lurking.

25:57.260 --> 25:59.250
- Thank you.
- My card. Thank you.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.410
Yes, it went down really rather well.

26:01.460 --> 26:05.330
- Especially when you said that boob
jobs might be tax deductible. - Yes.

26:05.380 --> 26:07.010
Call me any time.

26:07.060 --> 26:08.810
Thanks, Dave.

26:08.860 --> 26:10.850
She's rather...

26:10.900 --> 26:13.050
- alarming.
- Yeah, don't worry.

26:13.100 --> 26:15.410
Unless you're worth ten mill, you're safe.

26:15.460 --> 26:17.930
If you'd like any more
information yourself --

26:17.980 --> 26:21.170
I would. Perhaps we could
arrange to meet up another time.

26:21.220 --> 26:24.410
Of course. Yes. Would you like
your husband to be present?

26:24.460 --> 26:27.740
Ooh, I don't think we need
to involve him, David. Do you?

26:31.420 --> 26:33.770
Tina's not to blame.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.610
Oh, it's my own fault, Jen.
You know, I'm never satisfied.

26:36.660 --> 26:39.850
- I always want something more.
- That's the human condition, that is.

26:39.900 --> 26:42.890
Look, you've been going out
for, what, nine months?

26:42.940 --> 26:45.450
It's not unreasonable to
want to move in together.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.250
You think that she's being
unreasonable not wanting to?

26:49.820 --> 26:52.930
I am not going to slag
off your girlfriend!

26:52.980 --> 26:55.490
- You always slag off my girlfriends!
- Well, hello!

26:55.540 --> 26:57.930
No, no, no. You never
take to them at first.

26:57.980 --> 26:59.660
Oh...

27:00.660 --> 27:02.650
Why do you think that is, Jen?

27:02.700 --> 27:05.030
Oh, my God. Get off me!

27:05.380 --> 27:07.810
Listen, I loved Rachel.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.130
- And I like Tina.
- She likes you.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.690
Does she?

27:11.740 --> 27:13.340
She likes Karen.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.490
- A lot.
- They are close.

27:16.540 --> 27:19.370
They're probably talking to each
other on the phone right now.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.140
Hm.

27:22.860 --> 27:25.050
More tea.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.410
Ugh. Get something stronger.

27:29.460 --> 27:32.140
- Hey. - I was just gonna
show Liv my room. - Sure. - Hi.

27:35.180 --> 27:37.170
Ah, he's so happy here.

27:37.220 --> 27:39.210
Ah, that'd be the double bed.

27:39.260 --> 27:42.730
- Hm? - Mind you, it must have
cramped his style living with David.

27:43.180 --> 27:44.780
He'll be right off the leash now.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.700
- Not for long.
- Hey?

27:47.780 --> 27:49.770
This is so good of you, Adam.

27:49.820 --> 27:51.330
- Hello, Jenny.
- Hi.

27:51.380 --> 27:54.170
Just for a couple of weeks until
you get somewhere long-term.

27:54.220 --> 27:55.810
Of course. Of course, yes.

27:55.860 --> 27:59.370
- Your bedroom's up by the bathroom.
- Right. I'll just dump these.

27:59.420 --> 28:00.900
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:04.900 --> 28:06.890
What... Aren't you gonna warn them?

28:06.940 --> 28:09.430
Ooh. Er, Matt! David's here!

28:09.580 --> 28:11.290
- Oh, Matt, sorry.
- Hi, David.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.770
- Olivia. - Dad. - Your
blouse isn't tucked in.

28:13.820 --> 28:15.810
Vodka.

28:16.860 --> 28:18.730
Easy on the tonic, my friend.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.380
Oh, yeah?

28:22.900 --> 28:24.890
Don't tell Pete, but...

28:24.940 --> 28:27.130
I think I might be about to get fired.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.770
Oh, Jen.

28:28.820 --> 28:30.410
Why?

28:30.460 --> 28:32.930
I had a bit of a run-in at work today.

28:32.980 --> 28:37.530
- The hotel is full. - Because we've
booked out half the bloody rooms!

28:37.580 --> 28:41.610
Listen, I've got a keynote
speaker arriving a day early.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.650
I expect you to find him a suite.

28:43.700 --> 28:46.180
- He's a VIP.
- He's a toothbrush salesman!

28:47.540 --> 28:51.770
'An orthodontic clinician.' Thank
you. With letters after his name!

28:51.820 --> 28:54.810
Have you got any? Besides GIT.

28:54.860 --> 28:58.810
Listen, among my delegates
are a number of hygienists.

28:58.860 --> 29:02.730
Who knows how many hygiene violations
they can find in your kitchen.

29:02.780 --> 29:04.250
You wouldn't dare.

29:04.300 --> 29:06.610
Not a room, a suite.

29:06.660 --> 29:08.130
I don't have any.

29:08.180 --> 29:11.370
What I do have is a very good
relationship with your boss.

29:11.420 --> 29:14.820
Who I'm now going to inform of
your attempt to blackmail me! Hm!

29:23.860 --> 29:28.410
My boss rang me earlier. She's
popping in tomorrow... for a chat.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.060
Oh, dear.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.810
God, book lovers drink a lot.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.490
- There's not a bad review among them.
- Mm, I know.

29:37.540 --> 29:40.450
Critics are always sniffy. Envy mostly.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.850
Ellie? Ellie, will you
make some coffee, darling?

29:42.900 --> 29:44.690
I'm doing my history assignment.

29:44.740 --> 29:47.370
- Well, I'm about to.
- No, you're about to make some coffee.

29:47.420 --> 29:48.300
Why can't...?

29:51.380 --> 29:53.450
The Independent loves it! And me!

29:53.500 --> 29:54.970
Don't be so humble.

29:55.020 --> 29:58.530
You're not an unpublished author any
more. You're a star. Get used to it.

29:58.580 --> 30:02.580
- This Chapter One bookstore want to
know if Bridie will do a signing. - Yes!

30:03.620 --> 30:05.090
Oh, my God.

30:05.140 --> 30:07.010
I have a public.

30:13.900 --> 30:17.090
No reason. I just wanted
to say good night.

30:17.140 --> 30:19.660
We used to do that lying
next to each other.

30:20.660 --> 30:22.500
Well, you could come over.

30:24.500 --> 30:28.490
I'd thought about ringing you,
but I didn't want to seem clingy.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.250
- I nearly didn't.
- For the same reason?

30:31.300 --> 30:32.890
In case you weren't alone.

30:32.940 --> 30:34.930
Hm.

30:34.980 --> 30:37.650
We mustn't start
second-guessing each other.

30:37.700 --> 30:40.850
No, you're right. We should
be open and honest and...

30:40.900 --> 30:45.210
if we are missing each other we
should feel that we can say it.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.260
Yeah.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.810
Well, good night.

30:50.860 --> 30:52.690
Good night.

30:52.740 --> 30:55.810
♪ Weight of love on my shoulders...

30:55.860 --> 30:57.850
I miss you.

30:57.900 --> 31:01.650
♪ .. I thought that it
would be easier than this

31:01.700 --> 31:03.500
♪ I found my heart... ♪

31:08.320 --> 31:11.310
- We're delighted you chose
to join us. - Me, too.

31:11.360 --> 31:13.350
When's naptime?

31:13.400 --> 31:14.750
Sorry.

31:14.800 --> 31:16.790
Let me introduce you to my team.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.710
Sarah, this is Adam, our new IT guru.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.870
- Sarah handles our marketing.
- Great.

31:21.920 --> 31:25.630
- I'm no longer the oldest person here.
- Hm, is that why I got the job?

31:25.680 --> 31:27.520
Yeah, positive discrimination.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.870
- We've met before.
- Have we?

31:30.920 --> 31:34.110
- Yeah. I feel like we have.
- Now you mention it, you do look familiar.

31:34.160 --> 31:38.110
You may have seen Sarah on our website.
She's the face of our middle-aged range.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.600
- Something of a back-handed compliment.
- No, no, no. They chose well.

31:42.680 --> 31:45.990
Actually, if you're looking
for any mature male models...

31:46.040 --> 31:47.630
Hm. Your desk's over here.

31:47.680 --> 31:48.430
Uh-huh.

31:49.280 --> 31:50.880
Whee!

31:53.640 --> 31:55.120
Whoo!

32:01.680 --> 32:03.280
There you go.

32:05.240 --> 32:07.160
Right. Let's have a look, then.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.150
It's high, isn't it?

32:12.200 --> 32:14.550
High? Well, technically,
you should be dead.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.720
- Oh, dear. - Not been holding
this on the radiator, have you?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.470
Hm?

32:21.520 --> 32:23.030
Come on, Chlo.

32:23.080 --> 32:24.790
What's going on?

32:24.840 --> 32:26.430
You like school.

32:26.480 --> 32:28.550
- It's Sasha.
- She's your best friend.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.470
She was, but now she's
friends with Kayla Roach.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.110
And you don't like Kayla?

32:33.160 --> 32:35.310
- No, I do.
- She's feeling left out.

32:35.360 --> 32:38.070
They don't want to spend
any time with me any more.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.830
- Oh, sweetheart. I'm sure
that's not true. - Hm...

32:40.880 --> 32:43.510
Two's company... three's a crowd.

32:43.560 --> 32:46.150
- Jen, that's not really helping.
- True, though.

32:46.200 --> 32:49.030
You're besties with someone,
you think you always will be.

32:49.080 --> 32:52.670
Then someone else comes along. It's
like the two of you were nothing special.

32:52.720 --> 32:54.470
It's rubbish, really.

32:54.520 --> 32:56.360
- Have you talked to her?
- No.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.320
No, I mean, obviously, she hasn't.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.590
Well, I think you should.

33:03.640 --> 33:07.350
I don't suppose it's even occurred to
Sasha that you're feeling like this.

33:07.400 --> 33:10.670
And, if she's a true friend,
she wouldn't want you to.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.960
Hey?

33:14.640 --> 33:16.840
Actually, your dad's right.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.230
That's what we should do. Clever.

33:20.280 --> 33:21.960
Aw.

33:27.120 --> 33:28.390
Oh, hi.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.600
Time for coffee and a Bourbon?

33:31.640 --> 33:33.640
Yeah, come on. Come on.

33:36.080 --> 33:39.590
I feel childish saying this, but...

33:39.640 --> 33:41.390
.. don't you like me any more?

33:41.440 --> 33:43.430
I hardly ever see you.

33:43.480 --> 33:46.590
Oh, come on, Jen. Look, I've
been so busy recently, I --

33:47.640 --> 33:48.390
Ramona.

33:49.440 --> 33:51.110
Ramona!

33:51.160 --> 33:52.640
Sorry, Jen.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.390
Kar -- Marsden House Publishing.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.670
No, I'm sorry. She's in
a meeting at the moment.

33:58.720 --> 34:02.430
- Sorry. I was in the toilet.
- Yeah, I'll just put you through to her PA.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.230
Jen, how are you? You're looking well.

34:04.280 --> 34:05.990
- Ramona?
- Oh, yes, sorry.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.960
Hello. Bridie Sellers...

34:08.960 --> 34:10.670
Not too busy for Tina, are you?

34:10.719 --> 34:12.679
No, I've seen her. That's true. Yeah.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.790
- Are you jealous?
- No. No, I'm not.

34:17.840 --> 34:20.560
- You are, Jen!
- No, I'm not.

34:24.800 --> 34:26.909
Oh, I don't know, I might be a bit.

34:26.960 --> 34:28.670
Oh, Jen.

34:28.719 --> 34:31.830
It used to be just you and me.

34:31.880 --> 34:34.070
Cagney and Lacey,

34:34.120 --> 34:36.429
Thelma and Louise, I don't know...

34:36.480 --> 34:38.840
- Pinky and Perky.
- We still are that.

34:39.920 --> 34:43.590
Oh, I'm sorry, Jen. Look, I
should have made more effort.

34:43.639 --> 34:46.429
It's just you're my friend. I miss you.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.800
Jenny.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.429
Oh, Karen, Karen. It's Woman's Hour.

34:51.480 --> 34:54.190
Oh, blimey. Listen, you're busy. I'll go.

34:54.239 --> 34:57.550
Right. We're gonna go out
for dinner really soon. OK?

34:57.600 --> 35:00.430
- Just the two of us. I promise. OK?
- See you.

35:00.480 --> 35:03.070
No, it's OK. We can... We can invite Tina.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.440
Just won't tell her the right restaurant.

35:09.280 --> 35:12.990
- "Yes?" - David Marsden. I have
an appointment with Mrs Kirkbright.

35:13.040 --> 35:15.040
"It's me, David. I don't do staff."

35:28.840 --> 35:30.840
- Oh. My cue to leave.
- Hey?

35:33.640 --> 35:36.110
I had a call about you yesterday.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.150
The hotel manager?

35:38.200 --> 35:40.590
'Incompetent, aggressive, unhinged.'

35:40.640 --> 35:43.950
- Yeah, that's him.
- That's how he described you.

35:44.000 --> 35:46.200
'Unhinged' is a bit harsh.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.510
And, in seven years' time, any funds
invested in trust for your children

35:52.560 --> 35:54.910
will no longer be subject
to inheritance tax.

35:54.960 --> 35:57.080
What happens if we get divorced?

35:58.360 --> 36:00.350
Forgive me, but... is that likely?

36:00.400 --> 36:03.950
Well, who was it who said, 'No-one
marries expecting to divorce'?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.790
Me. Twice.

36:05.840 --> 36:07.630
Twice?

36:07.680 --> 36:09.670
You picked badly.

36:09.720 --> 36:11.720
Or they did.

36:13.800 --> 36:14.470
Shit.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.710
- Hm?
- Well, he shouldn't be home.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.990
- Your husband?
- We need to hide your stuff.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.870
It'd be good to meet him.

36:20.920 --> 36:23.310
Nikki! Next door's dog
shat in the drive again!
