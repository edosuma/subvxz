00:21.605 --> 00:22.856
It's good, right?

00:23.273 --> 00:24.483
Sick beats.

00:27.653 --> 00:29.947
You find the best music, Tamra.

00:38.121 --> 00:39.456
What do you think, Vera?

00:41.041 --> 00:43.502
The 16 bar introduction
effectively established

00:43.585 --> 00:46.171
the melodic progression of
the unrelenting percussion,

00:46.255 --> 00:49.007
which is both insidious and pleasant.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.550
Totally.

00:50.884 --> 00:53.095
But doesn't it make you wanna dance?

00:53.178 --> 00:56.223
No. I am not driven by that compulsion.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.642
Oh, come on, Vera.
I bet you got some moves.

01:03.981 --> 01:04.982
Or not.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.117
It seems my programming
does not allow

01:15.200 --> 01:17.411
for adequate interpretation
of music through movement.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.955
Well, everybody's programmed differently.

01:20.998 --> 01:24.418
It's more of a feel thing, you know?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.919
A feel thing?

01:26.962 --> 01:28.964
As in an emotional response.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.466
Yeah, I guess so.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.343
Alyx, stop the music.

01:34.136 --> 01:36.054
<i>Music is stopped, Tamra.</i>

01:36.138 --> 01:37.764
<i>What else can I help you with?</i>

01:37.848 --> 01:39.516
Nothing right now. Thanks, Alyx.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.561
This will require additional research.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.813
Enjoy your lunch.

01:48.859 --> 01:51.695
- Where is she going?
- Dance lessons?

01:59.578 --> 02:00.954
Hey.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.123
Kale chips, please.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.240
Sentinels! Target the transaction relay.

02:42.454 --> 02:45.290
<i>Declined! Declined!</i>

02:48.627 --> 02:50.462
My card's declined?

02:51.797 --> 02:54.007
I guess no kale chips for me.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.678
I tried to be healthy.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.227
Teenage emotion plug-in
installation complete.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.816
Whoa. Cool.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.480
That feels much better.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.026
Uh-oh.

03:55.277 --> 03:58.739
It's Megabyte.
I have to contact the guardians.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.297
Excellent.

04:15.422 --> 04:18.632
Control of this site is mine.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.969
You're not done yet, Megabyte.

04:21.052 --> 04:25.724
We're just beginning, getting started.
This is only step one.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.977
The anti-virus protocols
will kick in any minute.

04:29.186 --> 04:30.520
I am well aware.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.689
My forces are armed and ready.

04:33.148 --> 04:34.483
They better be.

04:35.150 --> 04:38.069
No mistakes. No margin for error.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.657
Global Village Bank is going
to come crashing down.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.891
Anti-virus protocols.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.893
Such amateurs.

05:09.976 --> 05:12.938
They are no match for my sentinel army.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.623
Where did that come from?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.041
Seems like a viral attack

05:33.124 --> 05:35.418
at the Global Village Bank's
bank transaction terminal.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.931
Did you crawl here? Let's go!

05:48.014 --> 05:49.057
Let's go!

05:49.140 --> 05:51.768
Megabyte is attacking Global Village Bank.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.853
Global Village? That's my bank.

05:53.937 --> 05:54.938
Mine, too.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.025
And I just deposited the check my grandma
gave me for my birthday.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.778
What would Megabyte want with a bank?

06:01.861 --> 06:03.405
I don t know!

06:03.488 --> 06:05.240
How am I supposed to know?

06:05.323 --> 06:07.450
You always expect me to know everything!

06:07.534 --> 06:09.119
Get moving!

06:09.578 --> 06:11.705
Okay. Okay.

06:14.499 --> 06:18.795
And remember, whatever happens,
I'll always love you.

06:20.088 --> 06:21.298
<i>Now go.</i>

06:30.473 --> 06:31.975
Man, what's gotten into Vera?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.351
Good question.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.437
She said she loves me. I mean us.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.147
That's the important thing, right?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.231
- Yeah.
- Hey.

06:38.315 --> 06:39.399
That's it.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.777
Something's going on that
she's not telling us.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.661
<i>I can hear you, you know.</i>

06:45.780 --> 06:49.659
Okay, so why are you acting so...

06:50.577 --> 06:51.953
un-Vera-like?

06:52.829 --> 06:54.914
I coded a teenage emotion plug-in

06:54.998 --> 06:57.876
and installed it into my
internal systems, alright?

06:57.959 --> 06:58.960
Why?

06:59.044 --> 07:01.254
To enhance my emotions.

07:01.338 --> 07:05.592
I'm trying to feel as human
as is non-humanly possible.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.011
Now, get off my back!

07:08.094 --> 07:09.137
Whoa.

07:09.220 --> 07:11.514
How about you dial back
those emotions a bit?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.475
How about you mind your own business?

07:13.558 --> 07:15.077
<i>Okay, look. Let's focus here.</i>

07:15.101 --> 07:17.771
We'll come in hot and send
Megadork and his cyber goons

07:17.854 --> 07:19.981
running with their tails
between their legs.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.068
Megadork.

07:25.695 --> 07:27.197
You re so funny, Vector.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.699
Vera, you gotta pull it together.
This is serious.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.078
You hate me.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.080
You hate me. You hate me.

07:35.163 --> 07:36.915
You hate me. You hate me.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.875
We don t hate you, Vera.

07:40.001 --> 07:42.170
<i>Maybe music will help your mood swings.</i>

07:42.295 --> 07:44.923
Alyx, play Good Vibes playlist.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.550
<i>Playing "Good Vibes" playlist.</i>

07:54.224 --> 07:56.017
Okay, so you good, Vera?

07:56.101 --> 07:57.560
I'm fantastic.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.354
Now go stop Megadork.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.779
There he is. Old Megadork himself.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.365
And he's got a whole lot of
sentinels with him.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.617
They must have fixed the
replicator in the fortress.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.178
I could've sworn I took it out for good.

08:14.202 --> 08:16.538
We'll worry about that later.
Let's move.

08:19.874 --> 08:20.917
Mag Frag!

08:24.838 --> 08:26.506
What happened here?

08:28.049 --> 08:31.219
Megabyte destroyed the transaction relay.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.804
Global Village Bank customers
are locked out.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.890
No kidding.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.519
Dude owes me a bag of kale chips.

08:40.395 --> 08:42.272
Ha! Guardians!

08:42.355 --> 08:46.317
Sentinels, do not allow them to interfere.

08:49.154 --> 08:50.488
Code disruptor!

08:52.574 --> 08:53.908
Frag Fists!

09:19.768 --> 09:21.895
<i>And now this breaking news bulletin.</i>

09:21.978 --> 09:26.399
<i>Global Village Bank officials claim
it's just a temporary system malfunction</i>

09:26.483 --> 09:30.779
<i>but other sources suggest, it could be
the start of a much more serious problem.</i>

09:30.862 --> 09:35.408
One that could lead to millions
of customers losing their life savings.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.618
Yes.

09:37.494 --> 09:40.955
That's the idea. The point, the purpose.

09:41.247 --> 09:45.085
Now, to break into the bank's vault.

09:49.631 --> 09:51.382
Look, a dark code rift.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.137
We should have known Megabyte
was working with the Sourcerer.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.065
Go.

10:11.778 --> 10:14.531
Wait. Now there's dark code.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.494
Whoa.

10:19.619 --> 10:20.995
What is that?

10:21.246 --> 10:22.997
It's a cyber worm. Malware.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.040
Scary stuff.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.959
It doesn't look so scary to me.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.338
Ugh, I take that back!

10:43.101 --> 10:44.227
Whoa.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.020
He plowed through
that like it was nothing.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.355
Vera, what's down there?

10:49.107 --> 10:50.316
<i>Vera?</i>

10:50.483 --> 10:52.485
Vera? We need an update.

10:54.779 --> 10:57.323
The worm is headed into
the bank's internal vault.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.451
If it gets inside it will wipe
out the entire system.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.996
All the bank's customers
will lose their money for good.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.814
You need to keep it together, Vera.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.334
But this song is just so sad!

11:08.418 --> 11:11.421
Oh, man, my music must
be stuck on shuffle.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.172
<i>Alyx, stop the music.</i>

11:15.091 --> 11:16.759
<i>Alyx? Alyx?</i>

11:17.135 --> 11:18.136
Stop music!

11:19.804 --> 11:22.056
Great. Now Alyx isn't responding.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.155
It's that code again.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.619
Guardians.

11:43.328 --> 11:44.662
Of course.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.624
You will not stand
in the way of my plans.

11:50.752 --> 11:53.588
Keep fighting off the sentinels.
I'm going after that worm.

11:53.671 --> 11:54.923
Zip board!

12:02.680 --> 12:04.682
Say goodbye, guardian!

12:04.766 --> 12:06.434
- Goodbye!
- Argh!

12:07.602 --> 12:09.020
This'll come in handy.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.492
Hey wormy!

12:23.534 --> 12:25.370
Looks like it's the end of the line.

12:28.373 --> 12:29.874
An obstacle.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.334
A barrier.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.211
An obstruction.

12:34.212 --> 12:35.964
But it's not gonna stop me.

12:41.386 --> 12:42.470
No way!

12:46.557 --> 12:48.476
Okay, I got this.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.699
That worm can't get away
from me that easy.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.886
Hey, guys.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.764
I'm down to 25 percent power.

13:30.852 --> 13:31.978
Yeah, me too.

13:32.437 --> 13:34.022
Deflector ring!

13:34.105 --> 13:37.859
Hey, Vera, we re extremely
outnumbered and running low.

13:37.942 --> 13:38.818
<i>Vera.</i>

13:38.901 --> 13:39.819
<i>Hello?</i>

13:39.902 --> 13:41.029
Vera, can you help us out?

13:41.946 --> 13:43.656
I have just the thing.

13:55.376 --> 13:56.669
The Codec has weapons?

13:56.753 --> 13:58.171
It does now!

14:04.510 --> 14:05.595
Yes!

14:05.845 --> 14:07.180
That's awesome, Vera.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.935
Defensive formation!

14:13.019 --> 14:14.687
Protect me at all costs!

14:20.401 --> 14:21.486
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

14:21.611 --> 14:22.612
Sweet!

14:23.071 --> 14:24.322
Uh-oh.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.324
Firewall!

14:29.535 --> 14:30.995
Stop right there, drill face.

14:33.331 --> 14:34.499
Whoa!

14:37.585 --> 14:39.670
Okay, so you wanna play rough.

14:42.423 --> 14:43.424
Sweet!

14:51.265 --> 14:55.019
Two worms are better than one.

15:07.031 --> 15:10.743
Oh, so that didn't work out so well.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.248
Not a good place to stand!

15:17.583 --> 15:18.793
Whoa!

15:19.752 --> 15:20.795
No.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.215
Undo, undo!

15:24.340 --> 15:27.301
The guardian code will not
prevent me, stop me!

15:27.427 --> 15:29.345
I will complete what I started.

15:35.226 --> 15:37.103
I hope you're still hungry.

15:40.773 --> 15:41.774
Oh, yes!

15:43.985 --> 15:45.153
No!

15:46.028 --> 15:47.155
No!

15:47.905 --> 15:49.031
No!

15:56.706 --> 15:58.082
Does she not see us?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.418
She's out of control!

16:00.501 --> 16:03.504
The scales have been tipped
in the guardians favor,

16:03.588 --> 16:07.258
but revenge will be mine
another time.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.135
Sentinels, retreat!

16:11.804 --> 16:13.431
Is it safe to come out?

16:13.514 --> 16:14.640
I think so.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.273
So how did you like the weapons
upgrade on the Codec?

16:22.356 --> 16:25.476
We would have liked them a lot better
if you'd have waited until we were clear.

16:25.943 --> 16:26.943
What do you mean?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.279
You almost took us out, Vera.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.655
Like, for real.

16:32.492 --> 16:36.037
Yeah, that was crazy close.
Not cool.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.249
Oh, I didn't realize.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.718
Here come the binomes to get
the site running again.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.053
Here comes Vector.

16:52.136 --> 16:53.221
Hey, guys.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.555
What happened to the worm?

16:54.639 --> 16:57.391
Not worm, worms.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.143
You could say I divided and conquered.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.561
So we stopped the hack?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.813
I can use my bank card
for kale chips again?

17:02.897 --> 17:05.441
Yep. Mission accomplished.
Right, Vera?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.958
Vera? Everything okay?

17:22.666 --> 17:25.169
<i>Yes, I'll be fine.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:46.607
I'm very relieved that you are all okay.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.818
Would now be an appropriate time
for a hug?

17:48.901 --> 17:50.152
Definitely!

17:57.952 --> 17:59.996
What happened back there, Vera?

18:00.079 --> 18:02.123
You were kind of out of control.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.083
I was.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.794
That is something
that I've never felt before.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.464
Maybe that teenage emotional
plug-in wasn't the best idea?

18:11.007 --> 18:14.135
I agree. That is why I deleted it.

18:15.553 --> 18:18.681
I'm very sorry that I inadvertently
put you all in danger.

18:18.764 --> 18:21.225
It's okay. We're fine, right?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.685
We are now.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.104
You made a mistake, Vera.

18:25.229 --> 18:27.106
There's nothing more human than that.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.442
I found the experience exhausting.

18:29.692 --> 18:31.068
One second, happy.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.653
Then sad.

18:33.321 --> 18:34.947
Then angry.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.992
Is that what it's like to be a teenager?

18:38.075 --> 18:40.119
Uh, pretty much.

18:40.411 --> 18:42.496
You just have to learn to manage
your emotions.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.665
Without any plug-ins.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.125
Yes.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.862
I think it is best that I deepen
my emotional understanding

18:48.919 --> 18:50.588
at a more gradual pace.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.591
It's also good to have an outlet.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.135
A way to deal with the things
you feel inside?

18:57.011 --> 18:59.847
That's one of the reasons
I started vlogging.

19:00.014 --> 19:02.642
Shooting hoops. That's my thing.

19:03.017 --> 19:04.602
I snowboard.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.228
I hug.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.564
Easy, lover boy.

19:12.109 --> 19:14.153
Perhaps my outlet can be dancing.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.036
Alyx, play <i>Never Change.</i>

19:22.620 --> 19:24.246
<i>Playing </i> Never Change.

19:35.841 --> 19:36.967
Would you like to join?

19:58.572 --> 20:00.408
- Special Agent Nance.
- What is it, Tuck?

20:00.574 --> 20:04.036
Dark code. It was detected
at the Global Village Bank hack.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.038
Dark code? Again?

20:06.664 --> 20:07.915
The Sourcerer.

20:07.998 --> 20:09.583
We couldn't trace the origin.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.961
That's because he's using
a Nova X3J prototype

20:12.044 --> 20:13.963
he stole from Pogo
Computer Systems.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.840
It makes our job much
more challenging.

20:16.257 --> 20:19.051
How did you terminate his infiltration
into the bank's vault?

20:19.385 --> 20:21.929
We didn't. It just stopped.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.264
Stopped?

20:23.764 --> 20:24.890
How?

20:24.974 --> 20:27.518
We couldn't figure that out yet.
But there's something else.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.520
We picked up the presence of this code.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.523
It's the same signature we isolated
at the Pogo security breach.

20:32.815 --> 20:34.900
That must be connected to the Sourcerer.

20:35.067 --> 20:39.864
Keep tracking it and stay on
the look out for more dark code.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.616
I have a feeling the Sourcerer
is just getting started.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.541
<i>I said no margin for error, Megabyte.</i>

20:50.666 --> 20:53.711
Yes, an unfortunate miscalculation.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.379
Your army is pathetic.

20:55.963 --> 20:57.047
Inept.

20:58.466 --> 20:59.633
Weak.

21:00.092 --> 21:04.221
I am replenishing their ranks,
adding greater resiliency.

21:04.764 --> 21:07.057
More sentinels isn't the answer.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.604
Maybe what I need is more Megabytes.

21:14.023 --> 21:15.274
<i>Yes.</i>

21:15.483 --> 21:17.610
<i>An army of Megabytes.</i>

21:18.305 --> 21:24.481
