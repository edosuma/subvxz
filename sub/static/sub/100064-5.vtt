00:01.958 --> 00:04.352
Previously on Van Helsing:

00:04.395 --> 00:08.660
My name is Max by the way,
Max Borman.

00:08.704 --> 00:11.576
That's her, that's Jennifer.

00:11.620 --> 00:12.577
That's my wife.

00:12.621 --> 00:13.970
Help, help, help me!

00:14.014 --> 00:15.624
Shh!

00:16.581 --> 00:18.714
Oh, I love this godamn
apocalypse.

00:18.757 --> 00:20.063
Ahhhhhh!!!

00:20.107 --> 00:22.152
Denver sent us.

00:24.111 --> 00:26.722
We are here to awaken
Michaela.

00:26.765 --> 00:30.030
The great mother of
the Sisterhood.

00:30.073 --> 00:33.076
Axel, come on!

00:42.477 --> 00:46.481
[footsteps]

00:51.051 --> 00:54.532
[distant growling and snarling]

01:07.415 --> 01:09.417
When did you hear?

01:11.201 --> 01:12.550
Excuse me,

01:12.594 --> 01:14.161
I... I... I didn't know you werearriving so soon.

01:14.204 --> 01:15.379
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt you

01:15.423 --> 01:18.165
during your beauty regimen.

01:18.208 --> 01:21.951
I only take the youth serum
as a test subject.

01:21.994 --> 01:25.998
You must regret not starting
it sooner.

01:26.042 --> 01:27.739
I'll ask you again.

01:27.783 --> 01:29.785
When did you hear?

01:29.828 --> 01:33.005
Word came yesterday morning.

01:33.049 --> 01:35.051
And there is no doubt?

01:35.095 --> 01:37.140
It was a house fire.

01:37.184 --> 01:40.056
She was going by the name
of Scarlett Harker.

01:40.100 --> 01:41.840
And what about the other twin?

01:41.884 --> 01:43.451
Vanessa?

01:43.494 --> 01:45.409
We're still looking.

01:45.453 --> 01:48.151
She was given over to social
services years ago, but-

01:48.195 --> 01:52.851
I know how you lost her.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.202
I know how you let
the mother waltz in

01:55.245 --> 01:57.029
and take the two of them.

01:57.073 --> 02:02.078
I know how you failed to find
them year after year.

02:02.122 --> 02:06.909
So what I need to know is
did you finally track her?

02:08.302 --> 02:09.303
Hmm.

02:12.610 --> 02:16.527
I have put up with
your incompetence

02:16.571 --> 02:18.007
for far too long now.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.140
I have done everything
in my power.

02:20.183 --> 02:24.100
There are other forces at work,as you know.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.797
Here's what I know.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.061
[choking]

02:29.105 --> 02:32.500
We need a Van Helsing
to raise the Dark One

02:32.543 --> 02:33.979
and you've lost them all.

02:34.023 --> 02:35.198
No!

02:35.242 --> 02:36.068
That's not true.

02:36.112 --> 02:37.069
You're lying!

02:37.113 --> 02:38.070
[cries out]

02:39.681 --> 02:42.292
I'm telling the truth,
I swear.

02:42.336 --> 02:46.122
There are more Van Helsings.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.517
Or at least there can be.

02:53.347 --> 02:57.046
What do you mean by
"can be"?

02:57.089 --> 03:03.400
I harvested everything I need
years ago.

03:03.444 --> 03:09.101
I always have a little nest eggset aside.

03:09.145 --> 03:11.669
You took the eggs
from the twins,

03:11.713 --> 03:14.106
but they were just children.

03:14.150 --> 03:20.722
No matter the age,
the ova are fully formed.

03:23.333 --> 03:25.074
Who else knows?

03:25.117 --> 03:26.945
No one.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.774
Not even them.

03:29.818 --> 03:34.083
Line up some military
volunteers, male.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.693
Virile.

03:35.737 --> 03:38.174
I want a variety of seed.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.439
And what's left of
the Dark One's blood.

03:59.848 --> 04:05.114
An heir and a spare.

04:13.383 --> 04:19.259
[evil laughter]

04:40.367 --> 04:42.456
Where'd you come from?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.855
Hey.

04:54.119 --> 04:56.208
What're you doing here?

04:56.252 --> 05:00.125
Somebody's probably wondering
where you are.

05:03.085 --> 05:05.000
Is that for me?

05:09.221 --> 05:13.356
That's uh... that's really
kind of you.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.358
Thank you.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.885
Does someone here take care
of you?

05:20.929 --> 05:22.452
-You should probably-
-Owen!

05:23.975 --> 05:26.978
Owen, get away from him.
He could hurt you.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.765
Is he yours?

05:30.808 --> 05:33.202
Don't ever go back there, okay?

05:33.245 --> 05:34.246
Jen!

05:34.290 --> 05:35.987
I didn't mean to hurt them.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.989
It wasn't me!

05:38.033 --> 05:40.514
It was the virus!

05:40.557 --> 05:41.558
Just wait.

05:42.951 --> 05:45.736
I never meant to hurt them.

05:45.780 --> 05:49.653
It wasn't me,
it was the virus.

05:49.697 --> 05:53.091
You were unhappy
before that day.

05:53.135 --> 05:54.919
You hated being a husband
and father.

05:54.963 --> 06:00.447
You blamed me and the kids for
wrecking your life every day.

06:00.490 --> 06:03.406
You came home and you killed
your children

06:03.450 --> 06:06.104
because you wanted to.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.289
Is he ours?

06:36.091 --> 06:37.092
Keep your socks, Violet.

06:37.135 --> 06:38.572
I can't do anything for you.

06:38.615 --> 06:40.095
You said that before
and came through.

06:40.138 --> 06:42.706
I- I don't know what happened
to the doctor.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.491
She was just gone one day
when I started shift

06:44.534 --> 06:46.536
and I don't ask questions.

06:46.580 --> 06:47.755
And Julius?

06:47.798 --> 06:49.017
He's gone.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.454
Broke out.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.456
That's all I know.

07:04.336 --> 07:09.080
So, you had the amulet
and you let the Van Helsings

07:09.124 --> 07:11.169
take it from you.

07:11.213 --> 07:12.954
Who was it that let them
mutants run wild,

07:12.997 --> 07:15.043
polluting the food source?

07:15.086 --> 07:17.045
It's time to join
the modern world.

07:17.088 --> 07:19.177
Leave the coffins
and capes behind.

07:19.221 --> 07:20.657
Blasphemy.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.225
Keeping the traditions is
the only road to survival.

07:23.268 --> 07:27.055
These so-called daywalkers,
they are an abomination.

07:27.098 --> 07:30.711
I've created a stable
food source.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.453
Humans that are resistant
to death and injury,

07:33.496 --> 07:34.932
who heal from wounds,

07:34.976 --> 07:37.587
that we can feed on again
and again and again!

07:37.631 --> 07:40.503
That taste like shit.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.113
Oh, you didn't know?

07:42.157 --> 07:46.640
Raising the Dark One is the
answer to all of our problems.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.119
But when the time is right.

07:48.163 --> 07:50.426
I don't remember requiring
your permission, Michaela,

07:50.470 --> 07:51.427
or your presence.

07:51.471 --> 07:52.733
Hmm.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.691
The Dark One expects us
to be there, Bathory.

07:54.735 --> 07:57.477
Yes, of course.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.263
But we must first hunt downthe Van Helsing and the amulet.

08:01.306 --> 08:02.786
The Sisterhood will track them.

08:02.830 --> 08:03.831
No.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.705
I'll hunt Vanessa.

08:08.749 --> 08:10.054
She's mine.

08:10.098 --> 08:10.968
No.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.667
You will remain here.

08:13.710 --> 08:19.411
You're too important to risk andwe need the Van Helsing alive.

08:19.455 --> 08:21.109
Be a good little boy.

08:21.152 --> 08:22.980
Do as your keeper says.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.634
Meow.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.984
Besides, do we really wanna draganother Van Helsing back here,

08:27.028 --> 08:28.508
kicking and screaming?

08:28.551 --> 08:31.946
Although that does
sound delightful.

08:31.989 --> 08:33.643
What are you hiding?

08:33.687 --> 08:36.516
Another scientific nightmare?

08:36.559 --> 08:38.126
Not exactly.

08:38.169 --> 08:41.564
Let's just call it an ace
in the hole.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.052
Get up.

08:51.095 --> 08:52.314
You've gotta have more
than that.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.142
Get up!

08:55.143 --> 08:58.146
How can this be?

08:58.189 --> 08:59.930
I'm a scientist.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.977
There are ways.

09:03.020 --> 09:05.196
But you've kept her a secret
this whole time.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.937
Why?

09:06.981 --> 09:08.678
It was the best way
to protect her.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.855
[fighting grunts]

09:16.468 --> 09:21.473
Locking it in a cage will keep
it safest of all.

09:21.517 --> 09:23.519
She's in a cage.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.434
She just hasn't noticed
till recently.

09:25.477 --> 09:30.352
[fighting grunts]

09:36.924 --> 09:41.058
The blood of such a warrior
will please the Dark One.

09:41.102 --> 09:44.409
The sacrifice of a mighty
Van Helsing.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.889
And a cherished one?

09:45.933 --> 09:48.109
[Violet] Get up!

09:48.152 --> 09:52.069
[fighting grunts]

09:54.594 --> 09:55.899
Get up!

09:55.943 --> 09:59.686
To pander to our dear one
you risk everything.

09:59.729 --> 10:02.514
Selfish and reckless.

10:02.558 --> 10:05.343
You made no other?

10:08.303 --> 10:10.958
None that survived.

10:11.001 --> 10:16.050
Is it aware of its lineage?

10:16.093 --> 10:22.796
That there's another Van Helsingout there to be found?

10:22.839 --> 10:23.840
Vanessa?

10:23.884 --> 10:24.885
Mmm.

10:26.451 --> 10:29.716
Violet has no idea.

10:29.759 --> 10:34.242
She believes herself to be
my adopted daughter.

10:37.288 --> 10:40.074
[fighting grunts]

10:50.214 --> 10:51.738
Get up!

10:51.781 --> 10:53.609
Up!

10:53.653 --> 10:59.223
[panting]

10:59.267 --> 11:02.313
Thank you for the new trainer
but I'd like my old one back.

11:02.357 --> 11:04.272
This one's broken.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.600
Make sure you get everything.

11:28.644 --> 11:31.168
I want these reports
and all of those computers.

11:38.001 --> 11:38.959
[knocking]

11:39.002 --> 11:41.048
Hey.

11:41.091 --> 11:43.311
Uh, I'm not interrupting
something, am I?

11:43.354 --> 11:44.529
Uh, no.

11:44.573 --> 11:47.228
Not at all, Violet.

11:47.271 --> 11:49.360
I was hoping we could have
another one of our chats

11:49.404 --> 11:55.018
before I go but um... were you
looking for Dr. Carol?

11:55.062 --> 11:56.019
Yeah.

11:56.063 --> 11:57.455
No. Not really.

11:57.499 --> 11:59.066
I mean, I know
that she's not here.

11:59.109 --> 12:02.112
That my- my dad took
her away-

12:02.156 --> 12:03.897
Do you know where?

12:05.420 --> 12:07.030
[sighs]

12:07.074 --> 12:10.033
So why are you here?

12:10.077 --> 12:13.820
She was working on something.

12:13.863 --> 12:17.998
Something for me, kind of.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.739
It's no big deal, I don't-

12:19.782 --> 12:21.784
I don't want to interrupt.

12:21.828 --> 12:23.307
I'll see you soon.

12:23.351 --> 12:25.179
You know where to find me.

12:25.222 --> 12:25.962
Violet.

12:30.706 --> 12:32.795
I think it's only fair
that I give you a heads up.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.579
About what?

12:34.623 --> 12:36.146
I'm leaving in the morning

12:36.190 --> 12:38.192
and I'm taking this evidence
with me.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.933
Evidence?

12:39.976 --> 12:43.414
I've been looking into
your father's past project,

12:43.458 --> 12:47.027
elements of which have been
hidden from us.

12:47.070 --> 12:50.334
I won't go into the details,
they're too disturbing.

12:50.378 --> 12:52.380
Let's just say I'm not sure
your father is

12:52.423 --> 12:53.860
the man you think he is.

12:53.903 --> 12:55.775
What are you talking about?

12:55.818 --> 12:57.777
What did you find?

13:01.041 --> 13:03.173
I just wanted you
to be prepared.

13:03.217 --> 13:06.046
I'm gonna call for an enquiry
into all of your father's work

13:06.089 --> 13:09.136
going back decades.

13:09.179 --> 13:14.532
And unfortunately that's gonna
impact you, too.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.805
[thud]

13:30.244 --> 13:31.245
[laughs]

13:34.291 --> 13:36.946
You are like a dream come true
for a guy like me.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.165
[coughs]

13:38.208 --> 13:42.734
No food, no water...

13:42.778 --> 13:44.258
Argh!

13:44.301 --> 13:47.696
And nothin' seems to kill you,
does it?

13:47.739 --> 13:49.132
Argh!

13:51.134 --> 13:55.182
You know, if you just tell me
why you're here...

13:55.225 --> 13:56.966
I'll ease up.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.406
Everything can turn out well.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.385
Exactly why are you here?

14:28.215 --> 14:31.044
All the time in the world,
my friend.

14:31.087 --> 14:32.741
All the time in the world.

14:39.095 --> 14:40.096
Yee-ahhh!

15:05.165 --> 15:07.384
I'm not here to help, I just
want simple answers.

15:07.428 --> 15:09.299
Look, I'll tell you whatever
you need.

15:17.264 --> 15:18.439
Thank you.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.701
You were a vampire
and you're not anymore.

15:19.744 --> 15:20.876
That's not possible.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.096
I was turned by a...
by a Van Helsing.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.401
I don't know what you're
talking about.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.708
No, it's complicated but it...
it... it's true,

15:26.751 --> 15:27.883
it happened.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.667
Is that why you can't die?

15:29.711 --> 15:34.107
No, I... I think I can die, it'sjust I heal from most things.

15:34.150 --> 15:37.980
I was bitten by something calleda daywalker.

15:38.024 --> 15:39.634
So you're still a vampire.

15:39.677 --> 15:40.765
No.

15:40.809 --> 15:42.245
No, no, no, no, no,
that's not true.

15:42.289 --> 15:43.203
I'm human.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.161
Let me help you!

15:45.205 --> 15:46.162
Let me help you get out of here.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.208
You and your son.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.995
You destroyed my life.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.608
And you want me
to just trust you?

15:57.652 --> 15:59.045
No.

15:59.088 --> 16:00.133
No, you don't have to trust me.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.264
With another child?

16:01.308 --> 16:03.397
I can't have you anywhere
near him.

16:03.440 --> 16:05.573
Then I'll stay here.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.097
Jolene will get you out.

16:08.141 --> 16:10.012
You and him.

16:11.013 --> 16:14.190
You're right.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.235
I was unhappy.

16:15.278 --> 16:16.932
I was depressed.

16:21.067 --> 16:25.288
I was stupid.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.377
I didn't know what I had.

16:31.425 --> 16:32.992
I'm sorry.

16:34.602 --> 16:36.821
Jen, I'm sorry.

16:41.826 --> 16:44.916
He won't leave without you.

16:44.960 --> 16:46.788
He said to leave him behind.

16:46.831 --> 16:47.571
What?

16:47.615 --> 16:48.659
No.

16:48.703 --> 16:49.878
No way.

16:49.921 --> 16:51.706
We're all getting out
of here together.

16:51.749 --> 16:52.750
Think of your son.

16:52.794 --> 16:54.622
I am.

17:06.982 --> 17:09.028
Has he heard from Denver?

17:09.071 --> 17:11.421
It's beginning to look like
the rumours are right.

17:11.465 --> 17:14.076
Everybody's dead and gone.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.165
What, you don't believe me?

17:16.209 --> 17:18.211
You're the one selling
dog shit around.

17:18.254 --> 17:19.603
Something might have happened
in Denver,

17:19.647 --> 17:21.083
but it doesn't mean
everyone's dead.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.171
Yeah, well I face facts.

17:22.215 --> 17:23.694
I don't live in a dream world.

17:23.738 --> 17:26.480
Neither do I, but I don't
kill hope before it's dead.

17:26.523 --> 17:28.569
My girlfriend's a survivor.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.092
He's in a shit mood, FYI.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.615
Yeah, what else is new?

17:31.659 --> 17:33.617
Look, Jeremy, I need you.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.576
I need someone on the inside
if we're gonna get a chance

17:35.619 --> 17:36.925
to get out of here,

17:36.968 --> 17:38.927
and you're as good as dead
if you stay behind.

17:38.970 --> 17:40.059
He will kill you.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.147
You know that, right?

17:41.190 --> 17:42.757
Save it for the Warden.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.152
[clears throat]
Well, there you go.

18:30.196 --> 18:31.197
Good as new.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.155
Nothing broken,
nothing drunk.

18:33.199 --> 18:35.723
It's a deal too good
to be true.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.812
I don't do returns, man.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.640
What do you think this is,
a Wal-Mart or something?

18:39.683 --> 18:41.076
It's not a return,
it's a trade.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.164
Max is the only one I know

18:42.208 --> 18:44.862
that'll fork out
for the real stuff.

18:44.906 --> 18:47.038
Don't exactly get high-end
clientele in there.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.039
You know what I'm saying?

18:48.083 --> 18:49.693
You got water, right?

18:49.737 --> 18:51.652
You can squeeze as many bottlesout of that as you need.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.958
Yeah, and end up
with a bullet in my head?

18:54.002 --> 18:56.135
Even drunks know when
they don't get drunk.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.048
Pass.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.007
Alright, look.

19:02.097 --> 19:04.752
I'll sweeten the deal.

19:04.795 --> 19:06.928
Seriously?

19:06.971 --> 19:08.147
How dry is this tobacco?

19:08.190 --> 19:10.279
Does it even stay in the papers?

19:10.323 --> 19:11.237
It's all I got, man.

19:11.280 --> 19:12.368
I'm in a bit of a jam.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.282
Yeah.

19:13.326 --> 19:14.196
It's the apocalypse.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.198
Everybody's in a jam.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.069
And you'll be in an even
bigger one if Max finds out

19:18.113 --> 19:19.984
you swapped out his liquor.

19:20.028 --> 19:24.293
Listen, I... I'm trying
to set something right.

19:24.337 --> 19:27.078
Something I turned
my back on.

19:27.122 --> 19:29.168
I just need a little help.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.566
-Okay.
-Okay.

19:36.610 --> 19:38.177
I'll take everything.

19:38.220 --> 19:42.224
Plus the boombox in your truck.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.182
Fine.

19:43.225 --> 19:44.095
Plus all the cassettes.

19:44.139 --> 19:45.488
Aaaagh.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.360
You're killing me.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.100
Guns are clean,
ready to go.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.799
I'd uh, give up the smokes
with all that C4 in there.

19:51.842 --> 19:55.455
Yeah, they're all yours.

19:55.498 --> 19:57.326
And I want those.

19:57.370 --> 19:59.676
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I- I gotta keep these.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.156
I need these.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.027
That'll cost you then.

I had an ace in the hole.

21:12.401 --> 21:16.579
[Bathory] I have to hand it
to you, I had no idea.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.189
[Michaela] Tonight we celebrate.

21:18.233 --> 21:19.452
[Sam] We feast.

21:19.495 --> 21:21.671
[Hansen] Ah, there's still
much to do.

21:21.715 --> 21:25.893
Relax for once, Willem.

21:25.936 --> 21:27.286
Show your true form.

21:27.329 --> 21:28.765
I miss him.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.898
Willem.

21:30.941 --> 21:32.378
Hmm. Show me.

21:32.421 --> 21:35.119
Hm.

21:35.163 --> 21:37.034
It's been a long time
since someone called me

21:37.078 --> 21:38.340
by my real name.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.124
It must be exhausting,

21:40.168 --> 21:43.127
hiding in this disguise
for decades on end.

21:43.171 --> 21:44.912
Centuries, actually.

21:44.955 --> 21:49.917
And yet I've grown accustomed
to being... this.

21:56.880 --> 21:58.491
Oh, don't worry.

21:58.534 --> 22:03.191
I will stay true to the cause nomatter how personal the costs.

22:03.234 --> 22:06.586
[Sam] Be true to oneself.

22:06.629 --> 22:09.197
It's my only guiding star.

22:09.240 --> 22:13.941
Yes, I can see that.

22:13.984 --> 22:17.945
But tonight we celebrate.

Heard from Denver yet?

26:25.192 --> 26:26.410
No.

26:26.454 --> 26:28.499
I have not heard
from goddamn Denver

26:28.543 --> 26:31.067
because no one can fix
the goddamn radio.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.679
This guy Jer brought in
to fix it

26:33.722 --> 26:36.159

26:36.203 --> 26:38.553

I'm sure.

There's a lot of that going
around these days.

They want me to report on you.

Are you reporting on me
right now?

27:10.367 --> 27:11.847
How?

27:11.891 --> 27:13.457
They haven't even
contacted me yet.

27:13.501 --> 27:15.764
Yeah, that's what you say.

27:15.808 --> 27:16.852
What difference does it make

27:16.896 --> 27:18.854
whether I've talked to them
or not?

27:18.898 --> 27:22.075
Either way I'll cover for you.

27:22.118 --> 27:23.685

kill you all right now

the only ones with spies?

I've got spies right in Blak-Tek

27:44.880 --> 27:46.969
that'll tell me your story
is all bullshit.

27:47.013 --> 27:51.147

they'll tell you the truth.

Why don't you fix it?

28:18.131 --> 28:19.567
I'm not a fixer kinda guy.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.787
Well, I told you to find someoneto fix it, you didn't,

28:21.830 --> 28:24.137
so now you fix it.

28:24.180 --> 28:25.268
I'll fix it.

28:25.312 --> 28:29.490
Wow, is there anything
you can't do?

Seriously, you're like a-

28:31.013 --> 28:33.015

to all the questions.

You know what?

28:34.930 --> 28:36.366
Fine.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.846
Fix it.

28:37.890 --> 28:40.240
But if you don't have Denver
on the other end

28:40.283 --> 28:44.374
in, oh, I don't know, an hour,
you're dead.

28:44.418 --> 28:45.419
Deal.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.640
Help him clean up the body,
why don't you?

28:49.684 --> 28:51.120
Make sure he doesn't bleed
on the floor,

28:51.164 --> 28:53.644
for Christ's sake.

28:59.085 --> 29:00.956
You could have let him
just kill me.

29:01.000 --> 29:01.957
I need you.

29:02.001 --> 29:03.393
Oh, and here I was so touched.

29:03.437 --> 29:06.875
I need you to save Phil
and his family.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.748
Promise me.

29:09.791 --> 29:13.099
You can still get out of this.

29:13.142 --> 29:14.448
You're their only chance.

29:14.491 --> 29:16.537
Get them out.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.677
You want us to get him out
of here for you, sir?

29:26.721 --> 29:28.288
Yeah.

29:28.331 --> 29:30.159
Just uh, make sure you don'ttrack any shit across the floor,

29:30.203 --> 29:32.988
and she stays here.

29:39.908 --> 29:41.518
Come, come.

30:08.763 --> 30:10.678
You do not have
a goddamn clue

30:10.721 --> 30:12.723
how to fix that thing,
do you?

30:21.515 --> 30:23.560
Not a clue.

30:23.604 --> 30:28.000
Just wanted to save that guard,get him out of here.

30:28.043 --> 30:28.914
Why?

30:28.957 --> 30:30.480
You got something for that guy?

30:30.524 --> 30:33.875
Still not my type.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.226
Well, let's talk about
your type.

30:37.270 --> 30:39.011
I don't really think I care
if you're telling me the truth

30:39.054 --> 30:41.578
because you lie
like a á*áá*á!

I got back as quick
as I could.

31:03.035 --> 31:04.340
Brought you that whisky
you were looking for.

31:04.384 --> 31:05.907
You are the best.

31:05.951 --> 31:06.821
Best ever.

31:06.865 --> 31:08.475
Can't wait for you to try it.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.172
It's the bomb.

31:23.011 --> 31:23.838
What's going on?

31:23.882 --> 31:24.491
Quiet! Shut up!

31:24.534 --> 31:25.361
What're you doing?

31:25.405 --> 31:26.232
I'm getting you out of here.

31:26.275 --> 31:27.407
Look, I'm not going anywhere.

31:27.450 --> 31:28.712
I'm getting Jennifer
and Owen out, too.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.105
Listen, if you told him anythingabout my wife

31:30.149 --> 31:30.801
I swear to god I'll-

31:30.845 --> 31:32.238
Shut up! Shut up!

31:32.281 --> 31:33.674
I'm doing it 'cause I promised
your friend, Jolene

31:33.717 --> 31:35.632
and I can use a guy like you
on my side out there.

31:35.676 --> 31:36.416
Where is she?

31:36.459 --> 31:37.721
She's with the Warden.

31:37.765 --> 31:39.593
I promised her I'd get
you guys out.

31:39.636 --> 31:42.378
It's a nice thought but I'm notgoing anywhere without her.

31:42.422 --> 31:44.424
Jesus Christ,
just shut up and go!

31:49.124 --> 31:51.126
[sniffing]

31:51.170 --> 31:52.562
Aaah.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.521
You sure you don't want some?

31:54.564 --> 31:55.783
Nah, I gotta get some sleep,
man.

31:55.826 --> 31:57.002
It's been days.

31:57.045 --> 32:00.483
Oh, come on, just one more
drink, one more.

32:00.527 --> 32:02.964
Alright, one more drink.

32:03.660 --> 32:05.140
I'll have another.

32:06.315 --> 32:07.490
[laughs]

32:07.534 --> 32:08.970
Can you believe her?

32:09.014 --> 32:10.711
She's got chutzpah.

32:10.754 --> 32:12.147
Alright.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.021
For you.

32:19.198 --> 32:20.808
Here you go.

32:25.813 --> 32:29.164
She's been talking shit
about Denver.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.252
Has she, now?

32:30.296 --> 32:31.297
Yeah.

32:34.735 --> 32:38.652
I'm gonna kill her, I just
haven't decided how yet.

32:41.742 --> 32:45.964
[quiet beeping]

32:51.578 --> 32:52.579
Where are you taking us?

32:52.622 --> 32:53.884
Just come with me, go, go.

32:53.928 --> 32:55.886
Please don't hurt my son,
I'll do whatever.

32:55.930 --> 32:56.887
Quick, quick, quick!

32:56.931 --> 32:58.585
Axel's truck! Axel's truck!

32:58.628 --> 32:59.629
Come on, let's go!

32:59.673 --> 33:01.153
I am not going anywhere
with him!

33:02.893 --> 33:04.460
Okay, then I'll stay.

33:04.504 --> 33:05.679
Don't come anywhere
near Owen.

33:05.722 --> 33:06.636
Look, I'll do whatever you want.

33:06.680 --> 33:07.463
I just want you to be safe.

33:07.507 --> 33:08.856
I want you to trust me.

33:08.899 --> 33:10.249
Come on, please, I need you
to trust-

33:10.292 --> 33:11.337
Shut up with this shit!

33:11.380 --> 33:12.860
We don't have time for this,
okay?

33:12.903 --> 33:14.514
You can fight it out when
we're all out of here, okay?

33:14.557 --> 33:15.515
Alright?

33:15.558 --> 33:16.559
We all have our issues, okay?

33:16.603 --> 33:18.039
Come on.

33:18.083 --> 33:19.345
Okay, okay, okay.

33:19.388 --> 33:20.694
We have no time. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.565
Come on. Come on.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.136
Yeah, I'm gonna leave you
all to it.

33:28.180 --> 33:28.963
Oh, no.

33:29.007 --> 33:30.182
Come on.

33:30.225 --> 33:31.096
I gotta get some sleep.

33:31.139 --> 33:31.879
Alright, fine.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.402
Whatever.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.664
Pussy.

33:37.711 --> 33:40.279
Hey, you think I could borrow
her for a couple hours?

33:41.889 --> 33:43.064
Oh, you mean...

33:43.108 --> 33:44.631
It's been a while.

33:44.674 --> 33:45.806
Ain't no better sleeping pill,
you know what I'm saying?

33:45.849 --> 33:47.242
If you think for one second
I'm going any-

33:47.286 --> 33:48.374
Shut the á*áá*á up.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.202
[laughs]

33:50.245 --> 33:51.507
Oh, atta girl.

33:51.551 --> 33:52.682
Come on, don't be a bitch.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.510
Do what the man says.

33:54.554 --> 33:58.253
I'll see you real soon, okay?

33:58.862 --> 34:01.169
Do as the man says.

34:01.213 --> 34:03.519
Uh, wait. One more thing.

34:03.563 --> 34:04.955
Max, seriously.

34:04.999 --> 34:06.827
How is Denver, anyway?

34:06.870 --> 34:07.654
You talk to 'em?

34:07.697 --> 34:08.829
Denver?

34:08.872 --> 34:10.178
I can't get them on the radio.

34:10.222 --> 34:13.225
Damn thing's broken.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.661
Denver's done, man.

34:14.704 --> 34:16.576
Everybody's gone.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.968
Blak-Tek wiped the whole
place out.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.100
á*áá*á.

34:19.144 --> 34:21.407
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.542
Wait a minute, you two know
each other?

34:27.195 --> 34:28.892
[laughs]

34:28.936 --> 34:30.677
You need to lay off
that blue shit, man.

34:30.720 --> 34:33.071
Don't tell me what to do.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.115
We'll talk about it
in the morning.

34:34.159 --> 34:39.468
No, no, no, she stays with me.

34:39.512 --> 34:42.471
Now you're telling me
what to do?

34:42.515 --> 34:43.820
You just told me
I could have her.

34:43.864 --> 34:46.475
Don't á*áá*á with me!

34:48.521 --> 34:50.523
[quiet beeping]

34:50.566 --> 34:53.439
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

34:53.482 --> 34:55.441
You hear that?

34:57.573 --> 34:59.358
What the hell is that?

35:01.186 --> 35:04.145
[beeping]

35:05.146 --> 35:06.147
You asshole.

35:06.191 --> 35:07.453
[gunshot]

35:10.804 --> 35:13.241
Or you could just do that.

35:13.285 --> 35:14.112
Come on, we gotta go.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.548
Go, go, go! Go!

35:15.591 --> 35:18.420
[beeping]

35:25.210 --> 35:26.124
Holy shit!

35:26.167 --> 35:27.429
Take what you need.

35:27.473 --> 35:28.604
Is there anyone else here
that can help us?

35:28.648 --> 35:29.736
Some guards,
all the prisoners.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.477
Alright. Get them quickly,
quietly.

35:31.520 --> 35:33.305
Everybody down, now!
Now!

35:33.348 --> 35:37.222
[explosion]

35:45.012 --> 35:47.971
[alarm wailing]

35:48.015 --> 35:48.885
You alright? You okay?

35:48.929 --> 35:49.973
Yeah.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.933
Yeah, so that was
the distraction.

35:52.976 --> 35:54.021
I see you found
the guns already.

35:54.064 --> 35:54.978
You blew up the Warden's
office?

35:55.022 --> 35:56.893
Uh, and the Warden.

35:56.937 --> 35:59.157
Not before she shot him,
though.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.332
You are a á*áá*á badass.

36:00.375 --> 36:01.637
Only when I have to be.

36:01.681 --> 36:02.595
Alright, let's go.

36:02.638 --> 36:03.726
We'll take the truck,

36:03.770 --> 36:04.684
blast right through the gates,
alright?

36:04.727 --> 36:06.903
What's going on?

36:06.947 --> 36:07.643
Get back in the barracks!

36:07.687 --> 36:08.470
Woah, woah, woah.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.254
The Warden's dead.

36:09.297 --> 36:10.037
It's over.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.865
Let 'em go.

36:15.216 --> 36:16.609
There you go.

36:16.652 --> 36:18.263
Come on, come on.
Everybody, let's go.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.003
Flesh, I want you in the front
with me in case we take fire.

36:20.047 --> 36:21.266
Everybody else to the back
of the truck, alright?

36:21.309 --> 36:22.092
Let's go!

36:22.136 --> 36:23.137
Come on!

36:23.181 --> 36:23.964
No! No!

36:24.007 --> 36:25.008
[growling]

36:26.532 --> 36:27.663
I thought you said
you shot him.

36:27.707 --> 36:28.447
I did.

36:28.490 --> 36:29.622
Get away from him!

36:29.665 --> 36:31.319
No, don't hurt him!

36:31.363 --> 36:32.929
Hi!

36:32.973 --> 36:34.453
Surprised to see me?

36:34.496 --> 36:36.237
You could say that.

36:37.499 --> 36:38.892
Ahhhh!

36:41.286 --> 36:42.461
Yeah, surprise, surprise.

36:42.504 --> 36:43.636
Oh, my god!

36:43.679 --> 36:44.941
What do you want?

36:46.508 --> 36:48.641
I want the truck
and him.

36:48.684 --> 36:49.555
No.

36:49.598 --> 36:50.860
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

36:50.904 --> 36:52.601
Take- take me instead.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.864
I'll pass, thanks.

36:54.908 --> 36:56.083
[Axel] What do you need
the kid for?

36:56.126 --> 36:57.084
Take me.

36:57.127 --> 36:58.912
You shot me in the á*áá*á-

36:59.304 --> 37:00.870
You shot me in
the á*áá*á head.

37:00.914 --> 37:01.697
Sorry, little guy.

37:01.741 --> 37:02.524
Calm down.

37:02.568 --> 37:03.525
-No.
-Hey.

37:06.615 --> 37:08.313
You know what, actually?

37:08.356 --> 37:11.316
Jer, you mind turning
on that Jeep for me

37:11.359 --> 37:13.709
and then walking away with yourhands where I can see them?

37:13.753 --> 37:14.884
No, please don't take him,
please.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.495
No, no, no.

37:16.538 --> 37:18.018
We'll find you.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.585
We'll hunt you down.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.803
Yeah?

37:23.632 --> 37:24.546
You.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.591
Get in the car.

37:25.634 --> 37:26.374
No.

37:26.418 --> 37:27.332
No, no, no, no, no!

37:27.375 --> 37:28.768
No! No!

37:28.811 --> 37:31.249
Do what you said
and find us.

37:35.601 --> 37:36.950
Now.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.213
A-ba-ba-ba, with the kid,
with the gun, yeah, go.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.127
Bye.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.171
You.

37:42.390 --> 37:44.523
Follow me,
they both die.

37:47.395 --> 37:50.398
Yeah, I just gotta know.

37:50.442 --> 37:52.400
That Blak-Tek story,
is that bullshit?

37:52.444 --> 37:53.880
Every single word.

37:54.489 --> 37:55.751
[gunshot]

37:55.795 --> 37:56.665
á*áá*á!

37:56.709 --> 37:58.450
I'm okay.

38:49.109 --> 38:57.465
[humming]

39:25.145 --> 39:26.842
Squirrelly little prick is gone.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.235
I told you, he's going east.

39:28.278 --> 39:29.541
That's where all his trucks
went with supplies,

39:29.584 --> 39:31.107
with prisoners.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.674
He's got something else
going on out there.

39:32.718 --> 39:33.632
We go after him, right?

39:33.675 --> 39:34.763
Yeah.

39:34.807 --> 39:35.851
That thing you told Max
about Denver,

39:35.895 --> 39:37.462
are you sure it's true?

39:37.505 --> 39:39.072
Ninety percent of that city
got wiped out.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.379
Any survivors are long gone.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.423
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

39:42.467 --> 39:44.469
Ninety percent isn't everyone.

39:44.512 --> 39:45.600
Doc's made it through worse.

39:45.644 --> 39:46.732
Then I'm...I'm-

39:46.775 --> 39:48.995
I'm staying there,
back at Loveland.

39:49.038 --> 39:50.213
If Sarah survived-

39:50.257 --> 39:51.258
You know she did,
she's a survivor, right?

39:51.301 --> 39:52.825
You got that right.

39:52.868 --> 39:54.435
Then she'll be waiting for me
back at the prison, right?

39:54.479 --> 39:56.437
And those people,
they need my help, so...

39:56.481 --> 39:57.438
Do what you need to do.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.439
Okay.

39:58.483 --> 39:59.527
You get him, Phil.

39:59.571 --> 40:00.746
Bring 'em back.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.053
Well, I'm not an idiot.

40:04.097 --> 40:05.620
I'm sticking with you, badass.

40:06.578 --> 40:07.622
Be safe.

40:07.666 --> 40:08.406
Move fast.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.626
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

40:11.670 --> 40:12.888
I'm not stopping
till I find 'em.

40:12.932 --> 40:14.455
You know that, right?

40:14.499 --> 40:15.761
Damn straight.

40:24.073 --> 40:24.900
No.

40:24.944 --> 40:26.511
I know I had my doubts

40:26.554 --> 40:29.992
but I'll be the first to tell
you I was completely wrong.

40:30.036 --> 40:32.691
Hansen's doing
a wonderful job.

40:32.734 --> 40:35.476
I'd stake my reputation
on it.

40:35.520 --> 40:39.132
If anyone can get us through
this plague it's him.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.394
Thank you, ma'am.

40:40.438 --> 40:43.353
I'll be sure to pass on
your encouragement.

40:45.747 --> 40:46.922
Well done.

40:46.966 --> 40:49.664
Your party tricks
have some use at last.

40:49.708 --> 40:51.623
I will take that
as a compliment.

40:51.666 --> 40:54.364
I'll write Avery's
official report.

40:54.408 --> 40:57.890
Make sure there's no moreinterruptions from the council.

40:57.933 --> 41:02.285
Now, about your Van Helsing.

41:02.329 --> 41:03.765
We need to find a more
appropriate way

41:03.809 --> 41:05.375
of storing her.

41:05.419 --> 41:07.160
Yeah.

41:07.203 --> 41:09.162
Sadly, I must agree.

41:09.205 --> 41:11.773
Leave the amulet
to the Sisterhood.

41:11.817 --> 41:14.950
We will retrieve it and disposeof the vampire hunters.

41:14.994 --> 41:16.517
Alone?

41:16.561 --> 41:18.737
I do not think so.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.565
We will both go.

41:22.349 --> 41:23.785
Where's Sam?

41:49.811 --> 41:51.421
It's real gold.

41:51.465 --> 41:54.033
The stone is real, too.

41:54.076 --> 41:56.644
You're Hansen's daughter,
right?

41:56.688 --> 41:58.820
I don't want any trouble.

41:59.865 --> 42:01.562
Hey.

42:01.606 --> 42:02.694
I just wanna-

42:04.826 --> 42:07.350
I wasn't gonna give it to you,
anyway.
