WEBVTT

00:02.872 --> 00:04.529
There was water everywhere.

00:04.530 --> 00:05.897
It was such a mess.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.918
That stinks. How long are you
out of the apartment?

00:07.919 --> 00:08.919
About five weeks.

00:08.987 --> 00:10.231
Ugh! Did you lose
anything valuable?

00:10.255 --> 00:11.722
Well, the pipe was
over my closet,

00:11.790 --> 00:13.190
so all my
clothes are gone.

00:13.258 --> 00:15.693
Oh, so nothing. Great.

00:16.464 --> 00:18.169
Do they know why
the pipe burst?

00:18.235 --> 00:19.435
They didn't say.

00:19.503 --> 00:20.937
Buildings
that have a combination

00:21.004 --> 00:22.205
of copper and galvanized steel

00:22.272 --> 00:24.936
are susceptible to
pinholes and corrosion

00:25.036 --> 00:27.371
caused by the mobility
of ions in the water.

00:31.267 --> 00:34.136
Can't have your head shoved
in a toilet as much as I did

00:34.137 --> 00:37.940
and not pick up a few things
about plumbing.

00:38.008 --> 00:41.210
Well, if you need a place to
crash, you can stay with us.

00:41.278 --> 00:42.745
- Really?
- Of course.

00:42.813 --> 00:45.681
You can stay in Leonard's room,
and we'll stay at my place.

00:45.749 --> 00:47.349
You're sure
that's not an inconvenience?

00:47.417 --> 00:48.684
No, not at all.

00:48.752 --> 00:50.052
And we live with Sheldon,

00:50.120 --> 00:52.421
so the word "inconvenience"
has really lost all meaning.

00:53.857 --> 00:57.393
So, technically, I'd be
moving in with my boyfriend?

00:57.461 --> 00:58.928
I guess so.

00:58.995 --> 01:01.444
I'd finally get to live
alone with my husband.

01:01.921 --> 01:04.083
Oh, my, this is
a big step.

01:04.084 --> 01:04.831
Mm-hmm.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.833
For two of us, it's in
the right direction.

01:12.005 --> 01:15.874

01:45.088 --> 01:47.256
Cohabitation
with my girlfriend?

01:47.324 --> 01:49.057
That's a great deal
to process.

01:49.081 --> 01:49.525
Mm.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.860
It's only for five weeks.

01:50.927 --> 01:52.862
Yeah, and we'll be
right across the hall.

01:52.929 --> 01:54.130
What do you think?

01:54.197 --> 01:55.631
I don't know.

01:55.699 --> 01:59.135
What if living together
kills the romance?

02:00.737 --> 02:03.472
Okay, you guys had sex
one whole time.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.841
Nothing can put out
a fire like that.

02:05.909 --> 02:08.077
Yeah, but what happens

02:08.145 --> 02:10.246
when we each get a peek
behind the curtain?

02:10.312 --> 02:13.082
I mean, she's never even
seen me unshaven.

02:13.150 --> 02:14.950
You just shaved yesterday.

02:15.018 --> 02:16.452
You're good for three months.

02:16.520 --> 02:19.121
Sheldon, I understand
your apprehension,

02:19.189 --> 02:21.290
but let me appeal
to the scientist in you.

02:21.358 --> 02:23.359
Given the five-week end date,

02:23.427 --> 02:26.395
isn't it the perfect opportunity
to consider this an experiment

02:26.463 --> 02:28.431
and collect data
on our compatibility?

02:28.498 --> 02:31.734
Don't try luring me in
with sexy talk.

02:31.802 --> 02:33.202
Okay.

02:33.270 --> 02:34.703
<i>The Original Series.</i>

02:34.771 --> 02:36.372
The <i>Enterprise</i> was
on a five-year mission

02:36.440 --> 02:37.573
to explore new worlds.

02:37.641 --> 02:38.741
Think of this
as your

02:38.809 --> 02:41.110
personal five-week mission
to do the same.

02:41.178 --> 02:45.448
If you want to lure me in with
sexy talk, that's how you do it.

02:46.917 --> 02:49.118
Don't be proud of that.

02:50.320 --> 02:52.121
So, is that a yes?

02:52.189 --> 02:53.456
Not yet. I...

02:53.523 --> 02:56.559
How will I learn if
I'm comfortable living with Amy

02:56.626 --> 02:58.794
or just comfortable because
I'm in my own apartment?

02:58.862 --> 03:01.197
Now, if this experiment
is going to be valid,

03:01.264 --> 03:03.065
I suggest a neutral environment.

03:03.133 --> 03:04.400
Well, where would you go?

03:04.468 --> 03:05.768
Well, ideally, an enclosed,

03:05.836 --> 03:09.738
self-sustaining biodome
in New Mexico.

03:09.806 --> 03:14.143
Where we would eat crops
fertilized with our own waste.

03:14.211 --> 03:17.379
And you were worried
about the romance.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.914
Wait.

03:18.982 --> 03:21.917
Why don't you guys stay across
the hall, and we will live here?

03:21.985 --> 03:23.652
Interesting.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.121
If my official residence
were across the hall,

03:26.189 --> 03:30.359
I wonder if I'd need to knock
every time I came over here.

03:30.427 --> 03:32.027
That's a good question.

03:32.095 --> 03:34.163
Maybe just don't come over.

03:36.399 --> 03:39.235
Historically, I don't
do well with change.

03:39.302 --> 03:40.536
Okay, it won't
be that bad.

03:40.604 --> 03:42.114
We wouldn't even sit in
your spot while you're gone.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.706
You're darn right, you wouldn't.

03:43.773 --> 03:46.108
No matter where I am,
this will always be my spot.

03:46.176 --> 03:47.243
Like an embassy

03:47.310 --> 03:48.511
in a foreign country,

03:48.578 --> 03:51.647
this seat is the sovereign
soil of my bottom.

03:51.715 --> 03:54.717
Just nod and smile.
He's almost gone.

03:56.386 --> 03:58.821
Sheldon, what do you think?

04:01.458 --> 04:02.992
Very well. I'm on board.

04:03.059 --> 04:04.426
- Seriously?
- Yes.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.861
I accept this
five-week mission

04:05.929 --> 04:07.997
to share a living space
with my girlfriend.

04:08.064 --> 04:09.465
Oh. This is so exciting.

04:09.533 --> 04:11.700
Well, now, don't be surprised
if, like <i>Star Trek,</i>

04:11.768 --> 04:14.603
it's canceled in three.

04:15.772 --> 04:19.440
I have to say, I am happy
with your ob-gyn.

04:20.777 --> 04:23.879
Cool. 'Cause she says
you're doing a great job as

04:23.947 --> 04:27.016
"weird friend who doesn't have
to be at every appointment."

04:27.083 --> 04:29.518
I'm the son of a gynecologist.
I could be helpful.

04:29.586 --> 04:30.819
It would help

04:30.887 --> 04:34.623
if you stopped telling me
I have a textbook cervix.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.693
The polite response is,
"Thank you for noticing."

04:40.931 --> 04:43.132
Let me see the sonogram again.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.536
Oh, yeah, that's a good-looking
baby for a little gray blob.

04:47.604 --> 04:50.272
Yeah, we could
name him Blobert.

04:50.340 --> 04:51.941
What if it's a girl?

04:52.008 --> 04:53.742
Bloberta.

04:55.045 --> 04:56.478
Or Blobbi with an "I."

04:56.546 --> 05:00.115
Are we being silly
not finding out the sex?

05:00.183 --> 05:02.618
Yeah, I was just
thinking the same thing.

05:02.686 --> 05:04.553
If you want,
you can find out right now.

05:04.621 --> 05:05.955
- Mm.
- Hmm.

05:06.022 --> 05:08.062
The doctor's gone for the
day, so it doesn't matter.

05:08.091 --> 05:09.224
Well, somebody else knows

05:09.292 --> 05:10.993
because they saw it
in the folder.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.028
You looked in
our folder?!

05:13.096 --> 05:14.163
It was an accident.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.231
The doctor left
the folder out on her desk.

05:16.299 --> 05:19.435
It's not my fault
I opened it and looked.

05:19.502 --> 05:23.138
So you know the sex
of our baby, and we don't?!

05:23.206 --> 05:26.141
Flip a coin.
You got a fifty-fifty shot.

05:26.209 --> 05:28.143
It's unbelievable.

05:28.211 --> 05:29.478
- God, Raj.
- What?

05:29.546 --> 05:30.980
This is not a problem, okay?

05:31.047 --> 05:33.182
If you don't want to know,
I don't have to tell you.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.217
We don't want <i>you</i> to know!

05:35.285 --> 05:37.753
Okay, well, that's a problem.

05:40.457 --> 05:43.692
You know, I'm very proud of you
for trying to live with Amy.

05:43.760 --> 05:44.927
- Oh. Thank you.
- Mm.

05:44.995 --> 05:47.062
Of course, the ideal way
to conduct this experiment

05:47.130 --> 05:50.532
would be with four pairs of
identical Sheldons and Amys.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.235
One pair that was neither
dating nor living together.

05:53.303 --> 05:55.437
One pair that was dating
but not living together.

05:55.505 --> 05:57.149
One pair that was living
together but not dating.

05:57.173 --> 05:58.293
And then, of
course, one pair

05:58.341 --> 06:00.242
that was living
together and dating.

06:00.310 --> 06:01.644
Although, with
that many Sheldons,

06:01.711 --> 06:04.279
it'd be such a party,
we'd never get anything done.

06:04.347 --> 06:06.682
That was a cute story.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.550
So, um...

06:10.186 --> 06:11.487
What did you want to ask me?

06:11.554 --> 06:14.723
Well, you've lived with your
significant other for some time.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.759
I would like this
experiment to go well.

06:16.826 --> 06:19.495
Are there any insights
you can share?

06:19.562 --> 06:22.965
Mm. Well, the biggie is,
if she has an insane roommate,

06:23.033 --> 06:24.833
kick him out
as soon as possible.

06:24.901 --> 06:27.803
You know, Leonard
and I were very happy

06:27.871 --> 06:29.605
before you came along.

06:31.207 --> 06:33.042
You've been roommates
with Sheldon forever.

06:33.109 --> 06:35.177
Do you have any advice?

06:35.245 --> 06:37.379
I'm trying to think of an answer

06:37.447 --> 06:39.615
that won't stop you
from doing this.

06:41.084 --> 06:42.384
I know it sounds
like a cliché,

06:42.452 --> 06:43.619
but compromise is key.

06:43.687 --> 06:45.421
Never leave a belt
on the floor.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.323
At night, they
look like snakes.

06:48.391 --> 06:50.893
Do little things, like bring her
a cup of coffee in bed.

06:50.960 --> 06:52.394
Keep M&M'S in your pocket

06:52.462 --> 06:54.463
in case you have to
wait in a long line.

06:55.732 --> 06:57.566
You're gonna be seeing
each other a lot,

06:57.634 --> 06:59.702
so respect each other's
personal space.

06:59.769 --> 07:04.373
He startles easily, so,
please, no flash photography.

07:07.243 --> 07:10.879
How many pairs of underwear
did you pack for the move?

07:10.947 --> 07:13.282
I don't know. I didn't count.

07:13.349 --> 07:16.785
You truly are the Goofus
to my Gallant.

07:18.254 --> 07:20.222
That's me. Listen,

07:20.290 --> 07:24.593
you and I are gonna
be sharing a bed.

07:24.661 --> 07:27.896
You know, this is uncharted
territory for both of us.

07:27.964 --> 07:29.264
How are you feeling about that?

07:29.332 --> 07:32.735
Oh, excited, concerned,

07:32.802 --> 07:33.802
a little scared.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.070
All the same emotions

07:35.138 --> 07:37.306
I feel
in line at Space Mountain.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.077
Well, if you're nervous
about the sleeping arrangements,

07:42.145 --> 07:43.812
maybe we should talk about it.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.814
Okay.

07:48.585 --> 07:50.586
Talk.

07:50.653 --> 07:53.956
Well, I imagine
one of your concerns

07:54.023 --> 07:55.758
might be coital
expectations.

07:55.825 --> 07:58.660
Wow, no foreplay or anything,
just right to it.

08:00.029 --> 08:01.764
Look, I know
this experiment

08:01.831 --> 08:04.166
is a big step outside
of your comfort zone.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.636
So why don't we take being
physical off the table

08:07.704 --> 08:09.338
and maybe later on,

08:09.405 --> 08:12.307
once we're more settled in,
we can revisit it.

08:12.375 --> 08:15.144
You're really okay with that?

08:15.211 --> 08:16.779
I've never lived
with someone, either.

08:16.846 --> 08:18.614
This is a lot for me, too.

08:20.150 --> 08:21.350
This is such a relief.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.919
Honestly, if it didn't
get you all worked up,

08:23.987 --> 08:26.655
I'd kiss you right now.

08:26.723 --> 08:28.590
Good call.

08:28.658 --> 08:30.425
Seeing your
Teen Titans underwear

08:30.493 --> 08:32.760
really got my
motor running.

08:32.828 --> 08:35.731
I know. They probably shouldn't
sell those to children.

08:39.402 --> 08:40.869
Well, here's your key.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.236
Thank you.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.871
Enjoy having the place
to yourselves.

08:43.940 --> 08:47.576
You enjoy your mission to boldly
go where no man has gone before.

08:50.013 --> 08:51.513
It's Penny's bedroom.

08:51.581 --> 08:53.448
Plenty of men have gone before.

08:56.519 --> 08:59.955
Now, now, there's no need
to make this emotional.

09:00.023 --> 09:02.858
Shall we?

09:02.926 --> 09:04.993
I guess this is it.

09:05.061 --> 09:05.861
You guys have fun.

09:05.929 --> 09:08.363
You, too.

09:09.232 --> 09:11.300
Oh, don't forget.

09:11.367 --> 09:13.802
Tuesday the air filters
need to be changed.

09:13.870 --> 09:15.537
Yeah, you wrote it on my hand.

09:15.605 --> 09:16.705
Oh.

09:18.274 --> 09:19.575
Oh, and every other day,

09:19.642 --> 09:22.010
check the water level
on the avocado pit.

09:22.078 --> 09:23.245
I'm on it.

09:23.313 --> 09:26.248
15 years from now, we'll
make guacamole together.

09:26.316 --> 09:28.317
Leonard, please, let me go.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.624
Come on, Sheldon.

09:35.692 --> 09:37.326
Oh. Bye.

09:37.393 --> 09:39.628
- Good night.
- Good night.

09:43.566 --> 09:45.100
Well, that's it.

09:45.168 --> 09:47.936
For the next five weeks, we are
officially living together.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.439
I guess the experiment begins.

09:50.506 --> 09:51.773
We did it!

09:51.841 --> 09:53.742
Yeah!

09:55.000 --> 10:01.074

10:02.840 --> 10:05.041
Which side of the bed
would you prefer?

10:05.109 --> 10:06.710
Doesn't matter to me.
Your choice.

10:06.777 --> 10:09.713
No, no, we're living together
now-- everything's equal.

10:09.780 --> 10:12.148
You know? I know that I have
a tendency to be controlling,

10:12.216 --> 10:13.617
so I would rather
you choose.

10:13.684 --> 10:15.229
Well, Sheldon,
I really appreciate that,

10:15.253 --> 10:17.587
but these things mean more
to you than they do to me,

10:17.655 --> 10:18.889
so whatever you want.

10:18.956 --> 10:20.400
Well, clearly,
it's <i>not</i> whatever I want,

10:20.424 --> 10:22.926
because what I want is for you
to make this decision,

10:22.994 --> 10:24.661
and you refuse to do that.

10:24.729 --> 10:26.062
Well, I'm not refusing.

10:26.130 --> 10:27.898
I'm just trying
to be considerate.

10:27.965 --> 10:29.799
Like when you
let me get those shoes

10:29.867 --> 10:31.201
with the wheels on the bottom,

10:31.269 --> 10:32.946
and then watched me roll
right into traffic?

10:32.970 --> 10:34.298
Sheldon, will you please
just pick a side?

10:34.322 --> 10:35.390
Fine.

10:41.913 --> 10:44.214
Okay. Now, on this side,

10:44.282 --> 10:48.118
I am closer to the exit
in case of emergency.

10:48.185 --> 10:50.287
Great. That's your side.

10:50.354 --> 10:54.457
No, but I'm also closer to
the entrance in case of attack.

10:54.525 --> 10:57.093
Okay, <i>I'll</i> take that side.

10:57.161 --> 10:58.839
Ah, then again, what are
the odds of someone attacking me?

10:58.863 --> 11:00.330
Rising rapidly.

11:03.234 --> 11:06.903
Now, this side offers me
proximity to the bathroom,

11:06.971 --> 11:09.005
but I am closer to the window

11:09.073 --> 11:11.641
where perverts
can watch me sleep.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.610
Okay.

11:13.678 --> 11:16.279
What if we do this?

11:18.783 --> 11:19.783
I suppose that works.

11:19.850 --> 11:20.951
Great.

11:24.689 --> 11:26.189
Although now I'm kind of worried

11:26.257 --> 11:28.124
someone's hiding
behind those drapes.

11:31.896 --> 11:33.663
This is ridiculous.

11:33.731 --> 11:36.967
The doctor knows what the baby
is, the ultrasound tech knows,

11:37.034 --> 11:38.435
Raj knows,

11:38.502 --> 11:42.138
his <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> online
fan group probably knows.

11:43.341 --> 11:45.075
Is it weird we don't?

11:45.142 --> 11:46.443
I don't know.

11:46.510 --> 11:49.145
Maybe the surprise
will make it more fun.

11:49.213 --> 11:50.814
Like magic tricks.

11:50.881 --> 11:52.616
Remember how disappointed
you were

11:52.683 --> 11:55.251
when I explained
the never-ending hanky?

11:55.319 --> 11:57.487
I was disappointed to see
the man I was engaged to

11:57.555 --> 12:00.624
pulling rainbow scarves
out of his fly.

12:02.126 --> 12:05.328
<i>But</i> how delightful
was it when I pulled out

12:05.396 --> 12:07.897
a bouquet
at the end of those scarves?

12:07.965 --> 12:10.233
It'll be the same thing

12:10.301 --> 12:14.104
when the doctor pulls
a beautiful surprise out of you.

12:15.373 --> 12:18.575
Everyone said I could do better.

12:18.643 --> 12:21.745
But you didn't listen,
and presto change-o,

12:21.812 --> 12:24.114
my baby's inside you. Ta-da!

12:34.425 --> 12:36.092
Ugh. What is that?

12:45.269 --> 12:46.503
Why'd you switch sides?

12:46.570 --> 12:48.672
Be grateful
I'm still in the room.

12:55.579 --> 12:56.913
Comfy?

12:56.981 --> 12:58.882
Oh, I'm just happy
I don't know

12:58.949 --> 13:01.351
what this memory
foam remembers.

13:01.419 --> 13:02.786
Sheldon?

13:02.853 --> 13:05.321
I know we took coitus
off the table,

13:05.389 --> 13:08.591
but I was wondering how you feel
about <i>other</i> forms of intimacy,

13:08.659 --> 13:09.926
such as snuggling.

13:09.994 --> 13:11.661
Well, it's funny
you should ask,

13:11.729 --> 13:14.164
because I was wondering
how <i>you'd</i> feel

13:14.231 --> 13:17.967
about separating the two
of us with a pillow wall.

13:19.403 --> 13:22.672
Sheldon, I've made more than
enough accommodations for you.

13:22.740 --> 13:24.774
We're both grown adults--

13:24.842 --> 13:26.362
we've been far more
intimate than this.

13:26.410 --> 13:28.144
If you don't want
to snuggle, fine--

13:28.212 --> 13:29.913
but we're not building
a pillow wall.

13:29.980 --> 13:31.181
Okay, well, I am sorry.

13:31.248 --> 13:33.316
I'm just worried that my
sensitivity to temperature

13:33.384 --> 13:35.385
could make this
a rough night.

13:35.453 --> 13:37.587
And no offense, but your
bottom radiates enough heat,

13:37.655 --> 13:39.956
I'm surprised there aren't
iguanas lying on it.

13:44.528 --> 13:46.663
That's it. It's
Sheldon's bedtime.

13:46.731 --> 13:48.198
He is in for the night.

13:48.265 --> 13:51.735
Wow. I cannot believe we are
alone in our own apartment.

13:51.802 --> 13:53.069
It's weird.

13:53.137 --> 13:54.297
This must be how parents feel

13:54.338 --> 13:57.574
when their kid goes off
to college.

13:57.641 --> 14:01.678
Unless they feel sad--
then it's different.

14:01.746 --> 14:02.879
So, what do you want to do?

14:02.947 --> 14:06.616
I know exactly what
we are gonna do.

14:06.684 --> 14:07.817
Really? You're a genius,

14:07.885 --> 14:10.320
and that's the first thing
you come up with?

14:11.422 --> 14:13.156
Hey, Sheldon's
not here,

14:13.224 --> 14:15.225
so we are going
to put on music

14:15.292 --> 14:17.494
and dance in
our underwear.

14:18.763 --> 14:21.598
Ugh. Can we just have sex?

14:22.700 --> 14:24.267
Oh, don't worry.

14:24.335 --> 14:27.270
Once you see my sweet moves,
sex is inevitable.

Hello.

Who are you calling?

17:34.451 --> 17:36.085
I'm so sore.
I don't think

17:36.153 --> 17:38.221
I slept two minutes last night.

17:43.994 --> 17:45.995
Yeah, get it, girl.

17:47.064 --> 17:49.899
It's not what you think.

17:49.967 --> 17:51.934
I feel like
I pulled something.

17:52.002 --> 17:54.103
Why didn't you tell me to stop?

17:55.305 --> 17:57.740
Even more not
what you think.

17:58.675 --> 18:00.510
I don't know
if I can make it

18:00.577 --> 18:02.345
through five weeks
living with him.

18:02.413 --> 18:04.628
If you ever need a break,
the owner of the train store

18:04.629 --> 18:06.308
will let you leave him there
while you get a coffee.

18:06.332 --> 18:07.793
Yeah.

18:08.852 --> 18:10.153
Good morning.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.321
See? I didn't knock,
but it's fine.

18:12.389 --> 18:15.291
I didn't knock, but it's fine.
I didn't knock, but it's fine.

18:15.359 --> 18:17.960
So, how is everyone?

18:18.028 --> 18:20.229
Miserable and exhausted.

18:20.297 --> 18:21.831
Really? I slept great.

18:21.899 --> 18:24.934
Well, I didn't,
and it's your fault.

18:25.002 --> 18:27.837
How? You had the whole floor
to yourself.

18:30.107 --> 18:33.476
Sheldon, maybe living together
is a bad idea.

18:33.544 --> 18:36.112
Well... Yeah, but what kind
of scientists would we be,

18:36.180 --> 18:39.282
drawing a conclusion
after only 12 hours of data?

18:39.349 --> 18:42.718
The kind who almost put a pillow
over your face last night.

18:44.354 --> 18:45.655
Wow.

18:45.722 --> 18:47.623
I anticipated
we'd have problems,

18:47.691 --> 18:51.227
but I never thought your
scientific rigor would be one of them.

18:51.295 --> 18:54.797
I'm sorry, are you questioning
my integrity as a scientist?

18:54.865 --> 18:57.834
If the lab room
disposable shoe cover fits.

18:59.002 --> 19:00.670
Was that a science diss?

19:00.737 --> 19:01.904
- Yeah.
- Was it a good one?

19:01.972 --> 19:03.673
- Eh.
- Ah.

19:03.740 --> 19:05.274
What would a
theoretical physicist

19:05.342 --> 19:07.143
understand about an
experiment anyway?

19:07.211 --> 19:09.091
I mean, you wouldn't know
a confounding variable

19:09.146 --> 19:12.281
if two of them hit you in
the face at the same time!

19:13.851 --> 19:15.384
And you don't even
get that joke,

19:15.452 --> 19:18.688
'cause you don't even work
with confounding variables!

19:19.556 --> 19:21.190
How dare you?

19:21.258 --> 19:23.392
Oh, you heard me.
Your experimental bona fides

19:23.460 --> 19:24.694
are laughable.

19:24.761 --> 19:27.430
Whoa, whoa! Now you're
making fun of my bona fides?

19:27.498 --> 19:30.233
Can't make fun of something
that's a null set.

19:31.368 --> 19:32.869
I feel like

19:32.936 --> 19:34.337
I should say "damn."
- Do it.

19:34.404 --> 19:36.038
Damn!

19:36.106 --> 19:39.339
Well, if you are so protective
of the scientific method,

19:39.340 --> 19:41.066
perhaps we should use
the next five weeks

19:41.090 --> 19:42.912
to finish what we started.

19:42.913 --> 19:44.914
Well, for science, maybe I will!

19:44.982 --> 19:46.482
For science, maybe you should!

19:46.550 --> 19:47.250
- Fine!
- Fine!

19:47.317 --> 19:48.851
- Good.
- Great.

19:48.919 --> 19:50.987
Do you want to go to our place
and make out?

19:51.054 --> 19:52.855
Does Stephen Hawking roll
through the quad?

19:59.963 --> 20:02.665
