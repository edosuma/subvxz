WEBVTT

00:00.180 --> 00:01.492
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:01.533 --> 00:03.160
One of the cops who worked around here.

00:03.187 --> 00:06.740
Told me about a fifteen years old girl
from the church.

00:06.807 --> 00:10.237
Just like Faith

00:10.277 --> 00:13.147
- He never did anything.
- So I just say he raped you.

00:13.260 --> 00:15.261
The Senate is launching
an inquiry, James,

00:15.296 --> 00:17.063
into whether your church
and others like it

00:17.097 --> 00:19.232
are taking advantage
of your tax-exempt status.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.467
Pastor Skanks has offered me
complete artistic control.

00:21.502 --> 00:24.137
- Then take it.
- Pardon me?

00:24.171 --> 00:25.571
Take it, Nigel!

00:25.606 --> 00:27.307
There's something that you should know

00:27.341 --> 00:29.208
- before you pull that trigger.
- Okay.

00:29.243 --> 00:31.110
- I'm gay.
- That's fine.

00:31.145 --> 00:32.712
- You're hired.
- Praise God.

00:32.746 --> 00:35.114
Do you and Isabel have a venue yet?

00:35.149 --> 00:37.951
- For the wedding? No.
- Perfect.

00:37.985 --> 00:39.619
I want you to have it at the house.

00:39.653 --> 00:42.722
You're not planning
on reinstating Jacob ever?

00:42.756 --> 00:44.490
When Jacob shows me that he understands

00:44.525 --> 00:46.626
- the meaning of the position...
- Are you?

00:46.660 --> 00:48.001
We haven't sent his office

00:48.036 --> 00:49.736
any of the documentation they asked for.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.464
We're not legally required.

00:51.498 --> 00:53.599
As of this moment, we are.

00:53.634 --> 00:55.935
- What's going on?
- We're being audited.

02:35.302 --> 02:36.636
Mr. McCready, morning.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.438
Morning. Today's the big day, isn't it?

02:38.472 --> 02:40.440
Absolutely, sir. And yours, too, right?

02:40.474 --> 02:42.081
- Eh.
- Hey.

02:42.884 --> 02:44.914
Tell me what you think about this.

02:44.949 --> 02:46.412
I think she's going to say yes.

02:46.447 --> 02:49.048
Think so?

02:49.083 --> 02:51.017
Yeah. Always a pleasure, Mr. McCready.

02:51.051 --> 02:52.515
- You betcha.
- All right.

02:57.491 --> 02:59.680
Rough morning with your mama, huh?

02:59.823 --> 03:02.195
Yeah, I can't really
deal with her today.

03:02.229 --> 03:03.396
Anything I can do?

03:03.430 --> 03:05.583
No. She's off her meds.

03:06.969 --> 03:09.669
You ever want me to talk to her again...

03:09.975 --> 03:12.215
No, she's...

03:13.974 --> 03:14.908
it wouldn't matter.

03:22.349 --> 03:24.083
I got to go. See you.

03:24.118 --> 03:25.017
Yeah.

03:34.061 --> 03:35.261
Hey.

03:35.295 --> 03:36.629
Let's go.

03:49.743 --> 03:51.944
♪ Amen

03:55.415 --> 03:56.682
♪ Amen

04:05.292 --> 04:06.626
♪ Well

04:19.139 --> 04:23.109
♪ Amen, amen, ooh.

04:37.020 --> 04:38.667
Memphis' Man of the Year.

04:39.189 --> 04:40.156
What are you doing here, Junior?

04:40.190 --> 04:41.457
Hey, I'm just sat down.

04:41.491 --> 04:43.159
I think I'm still
allowed in the building.

04:43.193 --> 04:46.295
- Well, I think so, at least.
- What do you need?

04:46.329 --> 04:49.298
- You got any free time today?
- What's up?

04:49.332 --> 04:52.168
I want you to take a look at a
business plan I put together.

04:52.202 --> 04:54.003
- Come find me at noon.
- Yeah?

04:54.037 --> 04:56.839
- Yeah, all right.
- Aces.

04:56.873 --> 04:58.174
Congratulations, Mr. McCready.

04:58.208 --> 04:59.308
Thank you, Darlene.

04:59.342 --> 05:00.543
The auditor is in the conference room

05:00.577 --> 05:02.211
and said to come see her
the minute you got in.

05:02.245 --> 05:04.980
Just five more days.

05:05.015 --> 05:06.036
Mm.

05:07.317 --> 05:08.818
Before we leave, you need to make sure

05:08.852 --> 05:11.387
we get hard copies of everything.

05:15.292 --> 05:16.492
Mr. McCready, good morning.

05:16.526 --> 05:19.295
I heard my presence was requested?

05:19.329 --> 05:21.464
Yes, I'm wondering if we can get
the minutes of the meetings

05:21.498 --> 05:24.033
of the deacon board
for the past three years.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.468
- PDFs or hard copies?
- Both,

05:25.502 --> 05:26.936
if it's not too much trouble.

05:26.970 --> 05:28.104
No trouble at all.

05:38.849 --> 05:41.283
Uncle Mac! Got your text.

05:41.318 --> 05:43.552
Excuse me one second.

05:43.587 --> 05:45.387
What's the problem with Carlton?

05:45.422 --> 05:47.456
Darnell from the personnel committee

05:47.491 --> 05:50.826
told me this man's filed lawsuits
for wrongful termination

05:50.861 --> 05:52.294
against his last two employers.

05:52.329 --> 05:54.830
Yeah, but only because he's gay.

05:54.865 --> 05:57.355
He told me all about it,
and it's all good.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.203
Don't tell me you have a
problem with it, too.

06:01.732 --> 06:02.673
Even my husband...

06:02.698 --> 06:04.139
I don't have a problem with his
lifestyle.

06:04.174 --> 06:06.442
He can do whatever he wants
when he goes home.

06:06.476 --> 06:08.410
I'm just not sure we should hire someone

06:08.445 --> 06:10.880
who's so damn comfortable
in a courtroom.

06:10.914 --> 06:12.414
Carlton's not like that.

06:12.449 --> 06:14.412
He's very...

06:16.286 --> 06:18.787
if you'd just sit down
with him, you'll see.

06:23.827 --> 06:24.894
What?

06:28.999 --> 06:30.199
Is everything all right?

06:38.008 --> 06:39.875
There's my man of the year.

06:39.910 --> 06:41.277
What are you doing here, Daddy?

06:41.311 --> 06:42.945
You know you can't be here.
Remember last time?

06:42.979 --> 06:44.947
Oh, I know, I know.

06:44.981 --> 06:46.402
Your sister.

06:47.833 --> 06:50.542
Well, I saw the paper. I had to come by.

06:51.888 --> 06:55.449
You know, I always knew
you were the one, boy.

06:56.860 --> 06:59.028
Not everyone's on the front page.

06:59.785 --> 07:01.564
That is something.

07:01.598 --> 07:03.966
You got anything to drink?

07:04.000 --> 07:06.936
Come on, Daddy,
you got to go, seriously.

07:06.970 --> 07:08.971
- You got to go.
- Hey, hey, hey.

07:09.005 --> 07:10.806
All right, all right.

07:10.840 --> 07:13.409
Listen, you ain't got to
tell me that I got to go.

07:13.443 --> 07:15.706
I know. I know I got to go.

07:16.146 --> 07:20.171
I got to get that bus

07:20.205 --> 07:22.441
to Montgomery Park by 2:00.

07:23.286 --> 07:26.101
There's a filly in the third

07:26.135 --> 07:29.525
that's going to get your
daddy back to the top.

07:35.432 --> 07:36.899
Uh-huh.

07:44.007 --> 07:46.275
If I hit that trifecta,

07:46.309 --> 07:49.176
I'm going to take you out and celebrate.

07:49.210 --> 07:50.925
Don't do that, Daddy. Don't come back.

07:53.149 --> 07:54.850
Man of the Year.

07:55.744 --> 07:58.587
Can you imagine how proud
your mama'd be?

08:01.201 --> 08:04.568
A shame she's not alive to see it.

08:15.901 --> 08:18.827
This is where Jesus was crucified
and this is where He was buried.

08:20.041 --> 08:21.474
You ladies playing hooky?

08:21.509 --> 08:23.410
We're making grocery bags
for the food shelf

08:23.443 --> 08:25.711
if Pastor Ramona ever shows up.

08:25.745 --> 08:27.680
- Uncle Mac?
- Yeah?

08:27.714 --> 08:29.581
Do you think Jesus really
came back from the dead?

08:29.616 --> 08:30.816
Like, really?

08:30.850 --> 08:32.684
Matter of fact, I do.

08:33.537 --> 08:34.586
But it makes no sense.

08:34.621 --> 08:36.554
When has that ever happened, ever?

08:37.129 --> 08:38.590
This whole world we're living in,

08:38.625 --> 08:40.592
do you think you ever
could have made it?

08:41.014 --> 08:43.730
Or even made it up just in your mind,

08:43.763 --> 08:44.930
just as a thought?

08:45.766 --> 08:47.900
Skies and streams and trees and people?

08:47.934 --> 08:49.735
But here it is.

08:49.769 --> 08:51.070
If God can make a whole world like this,

08:51.104 --> 08:52.571
then bringing one man back from the dead

08:52.605 --> 08:54.373
doesn't seem like such a big deal.

08:54.934 --> 08:58.818
That's the problem when you
start talking about God.

08:58.853 --> 09:01.512
People always get hung up
on the wrong things.

09:04.072 --> 09:05.578
And what about hell?

09:07.158 --> 09:08.106
What about it?

09:09.335 --> 09:12.462
Well, do you really think God
sends bad people to hell forever?

09:13.228 --> 09:16.128
Oh, I hope not, for their sake.

09:24.581 --> 09:26.405
He doesn't seem so bad.

09:26.785 --> 09:28.021
Why would he?

09:39.619 --> 09:41.420
Could you please print the minutes

09:41.454 --> 09:42.855
from the deacon board meetings

09:42.889 --> 09:44.857
for the past three years for me?

09:44.891 --> 09:46.025
Mm-hmm.

09:46.694 --> 09:49.428
And email me the files as well.

09:49.462 --> 09:50.668
On it.

09:52.465 --> 09:53.699
Thank you.

10:01.608 --> 10:03.588
What's the fireball out there?

10:04.577 --> 10:05.651
Karine Jackson.

10:06.413 --> 10:08.380
That's Clara and Horace's granddaughter.

10:08.415 --> 10:09.882
I thought that
was going to be your office

10:09.916 --> 10:11.583
after Alexa cleared out.

10:11.618 --> 10:13.077
She needs more space.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.387
If space were allotted
in direct proportion

10:15.422 --> 10:17.389
to what people do to
maintain this community,

10:17.424 --> 10:22.027
I'd have a floor all my own
and then some. Oh!

10:22.062 --> 10:24.830
So, you're fixing to get more of
that Jackson Powerball money.

10:24.864 --> 10:26.031
No, no, no.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.566
I was just looking for somebody

10:27.600 --> 10:30.402
that that son of mine might leave alone.

10:30.437 --> 10:31.837
Mission accomplished.

10:33.137 --> 10:36.709
What?

10:38.411 --> 10:39.845
I heard we have a trespasser.

10:39.879 --> 10:41.814
I threw him out soon as I knew.

10:41.848 --> 10:43.082
I told you that I didn't want that man

10:43.116 --> 10:44.716
in this building ever again.

10:44.751 --> 10:47.019
- I know, I know.
- So, what do I have to do?

10:47.053 --> 10:49.388
Mae, there was a new fella
at the front desk.

10:49.422 --> 10:50.775
He didn't know the rules.

10:54.427 --> 10:56.776
I stay out of McCready family business.

10:59.140 --> 11:00.499
Mac, if he comes back here, I...

11:00.533 --> 11:02.572
I put in a call to Noah.

11:02.936 --> 11:04.369
- I did.
- Good,

11:04.404 --> 11:05.804
because I won't have it.

11:08.975 --> 11:12.144
And I don't appreciate you making
jokes like that at Jacob's expense.

11:12.178 --> 11:15.380
- Oh, Mae...
- No, you remember David and Absalom.

11:17.383 --> 11:19.218
You're going to regret that hardness.

11:26.772 --> 11:28.139
I'll be in my office.

11:34.724 --> 11:37.336
Look, how is that audit going?

11:37.370 --> 11:39.638
Flying colors.

11:44.077 --> 11:46.296
- There you go.
- What's this?

11:46.519 --> 11:47.953
The documents you requested.

11:57.924 --> 11:58.957
Morning. Brother McCready?

11:58.992 --> 12:00.159
Brother Sneed.

12:00.193 --> 12:01.226
You need help with that burden?

12:01.261 --> 12:02.394
I'm fine, thank you kindly.

12:02.428 --> 12:03.896
- You know I always ask.
- Uh-huh.

12:03.930 --> 12:05.731
Tonight's awards ceremony, huh?

12:05.765 --> 12:07.299
- Oh, yeah.
- Congratulations, by the way.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.700
Thank you much.

12:08.735 --> 12:09.835
Are there any tickets available?

12:09.869 --> 12:11.370
I bet you want to go, don't you?

12:11.404 --> 12:13.038
I do. Morgan Freeman's
hosting, isn't he?

12:13.072 --> 12:14.706
You know, I suppose he is.
I hadn't noticed.

12:14.741 --> 12:16.208
Well, it would be a pretty big mistake

12:16.242 --> 12:17.709
to miss a chance to meet
Red up close and personal.

12:17.744 --> 12:19.344
Uh-huh. Talk to my secretary.

12:19.379 --> 12:20.879
- I'll do that.
- Mm-hmm.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.116
- Thank you.
- All right.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.049
Hmm.

12:24.893 --> 12:27.293
Here you go, three years of...

12:28.087 --> 12:29.437
minutes.

12:50.723 --> 12:53.225
No one wants to go to court.

12:53.379 --> 12:55.447
Some folks do, actually, Mr. Cruise.

12:55.481 --> 12:57.816
It's their blood sport.

12:58.341 --> 13:00.052
Carlton's not like that.

13:00.086 --> 13:01.887
Carlton can speak for himself.

13:02.306 --> 13:04.890
I have only engaged legal counsel

13:04.924 --> 13:06.725
when I felt to not do so

13:06.759 --> 13:09.228
would be doing a disservice
to other people like me.

13:09.262 --> 13:10.283
Uh-huh.

13:12.265 --> 13:13.365
Here's the good news.

13:13.399 --> 13:15.734
I am completely positive

13:15.768 --> 13:18.870
that with this lady here
as my fearless leader,

13:18.905 --> 13:20.239
court will never be an issue.

13:22.909 --> 13:24.306
And what if it is?

13:24.911 --> 13:27.713
I mean, would you be
willing to sign a contract

13:27.747 --> 13:29.886
agreeing never to take Calvary downtown?

13:31.251 --> 13:34.072
Well, I don't know. I, um...

13:35.088 --> 13:37.318
I would prefer it
if everyone were to just,

13:37.578 --> 13:40.158
you know, behave.

13:45.331 --> 13:47.199
Could you give us a moment?

13:48.768 --> 13:49.901
Happy to.

13:49.936 --> 13:50.969
I've actually had to pee

13:51.004 --> 13:52.283
ever since we first sat down.

13:53.583 --> 13:54.615
We still having lunch?

13:54.649 --> 13:56.208
Yeah. I'll be right out.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.977
Okay, and see you Sunday morning.

13:59.012 --> 14:00.279
Be the good Lord willing.

14:07.238 --> 14:08.871
You're not going to let me hire him.

14:08.905 --> 14:10.856
No, I'm going to let you hire him,

14:10.890 --> 14:13.692
but you're going to hire him as a 1099

14:13.726 --> 14:15.427
so we can fire him at will.

14:15.461 --> 14:17.329
But he needs insurance.

14:17.363 --> 14:19.698
His partner Fred just lost his job.

14:19.732 --> 14:23.335
And if he lasts a year,
we'll circle back.

14:23.369 --> 14:25.457
Fred is not my concern.

14:25.492 --> 14:27.806
They were just talking about
opening a bed and breakfast.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.841
If we don't give him that insurance,

14:29.876 --> 14:31.810
I bet you that's what he'll do.
He'll open the...

14:31.844 --> 14:33.845
I don't care if he opens
a Popeyes Fried Chicken

14:33.880 --> 14:36.848
with a church organ in it and leads
the singing from behind the register.

14:36.883 --> 14:38.183
I'm not leaving your daddy's church

14:38.217 --> 14:39.851
open to legal attack from some...

14:39.886 --> 14:40.940
What?

14:41.721 --> 14:43.955
From some what?

14:45.364 --> 14:46.572
Huh?

14:48.276 --> 14:49.294
Say it.

14:50.086 --> 14:52.479
Litigious individual.

14:52.899 --> 14:54.766
Your daddy would have my ass.

14:55.790 --> 14:58.704
Daddy does whatever you say.

14:58.738 --> 15:01.106
I'm just telling you how it is.

15:03.343 --> 15:07.353
Well, I'll find somebody else.

15:11.117 --> 15:14.019
And he was so excited to meet
Memphis Man of the Year.

15:17.529 --> 15:19.224
What's so special about this cake?

15:19.258 --> 15:20.859
It's the one I want for my wedding.

15:20.893 --> 15:23.028
It's $800.

15:23.062 --> 15:25.162
Well, they're paying
for everything else.

15:25.898 --> 15:27.432
Look, can we talk about this at lunch?

15:27.467 --> 15:28.867
I'm just walking out.

15:28.901 --> 15:30.202
Okay, but we have to decide.

15:30.236 --> 15:32.704
It's less than two weeks away.

15:32.739 --> 15:34.172
We'll decide today, I promise.

15:34.207 --> 15:35.340
Okay. Love you.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.185
Bye.

15:37.043 --> 15:38.844
I saw you called. If this can wait...

15:38.878 --> 15:43.148
- It can't.
- He came by?

15:43.182 --> 15:47.219
Yeah. Have all your new guys made
aware he's not to be let in.

15:47.253 --> 15:49.491
I'll let them know. I'm sorry.

15:50.056 --> 15:52.357
Thank you. You know what they say

15:52.392 --> 15:53.825
about situations like that, don't you?

15:54.353 --> 15:56.537
Happy wife, happy life.

15:56.996 --> 15:58.289
Thanks for the advice.

15:59.132 --> 16:01.133
Do we have a problem?

16:01.979 --> 16:03.335
What do you mean?

16:03.369 --> 16:07.172
I assume Gigi's said some things.

16:07.206 --> 16:09.007
None of them are true.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.676
She got a wrong idea
about me a long time ago,

16:11.711 --> 16:15.112
and she just won't let it go.

16:16.057 --> 16:18.617
I'm sorry. Grace hasn't
said anything to me.

16:20.927 --> 16:22.754
I got to get going.

16:34.286 --> 16:36.254
Now, it's not Nashville Hot
Chicken, Uncle Mac,atter.

16:36.288 --> 16:37.756
but trust me, it's spicy.

16:37.790 --> 16:39.791
I'll be the judge of that.

16:43.896 --> 16:47.665
So, what's this business plan for?

16:50.903 --> 16:52.940
I want to put Daddy back on TV.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.241
Now, I know he says he's
never going to do it again,

16:56.275 --> 16:57.177
but come on.

16:57.212 --> 16:58.877
TBN wanted him back in the nineties.

16:58.911 --> 17:00.912
CBN called him just last year.

17:00.946 --> 17:02.514
I know, but I got a great price

17:02.548 --> 17:03.848
from a friend of mine
over at Voice of Life.

17:03.883 --> 17:06.251
Triumph's over there, all right?

17:06.285 --> 17:07.618
Growing every day.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.587
If he doesn't do it, Basie Skanks will.

17:09.622 --> 17:11.876
- Cold fact.
- All right.

17:11.910 --> 17:13.214
Let's have a look.

17:20.499 --> 17:21.833
Did you put this together?

17:22.323 --> 17:23.801
With a little help from Kerissa.

17:24.290 --> 17:27.872
- So, you two are back on?
- Giving it a shot.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.808
He'll be happy about that, anyway.

17:36.449 --> 17:38.249
- So, what do you think?
- Hang on, hang on.

17:38.284 --> 17:39.587
Still looking here.

17:40.453 --> 17:42.420
That is a hell of a price point.

17:42.455 --> 17:45.557
- Right?
- And are the, uh,

17:45.591 --> 17:48.359
ratings for these other
programs real or projections?

17:48.394 --> 17:51.328
According to their people,
that's who's watching.

17:51.764 --> 17:54.608
I called Davis Wentworth
over at Church for Change.

17:55.267 --> 17:58.403
They've been broadcasting a
half hour for six months now,

17:58.437 --> 17:59.871
a variety format.

18:00.176 --> 18:02.707
Traffic to their website has doubled.

18:03.048 --> 18:05.410
Offerings are up.
Collateral sales are up.

18:05.444 --> 18:06.711
It's working for them.

18:07.303 --> 18:09.247
Then go for it, I guess.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.418
Well, you're not going to
present it to him?

18:13.744 --> 18:16.888
Nah, he'll never do TV again.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.489
But why, though?

18:18.807 --> 18:20.052
I mean, what's his problem?

18:20.387 --> 18:23.728
Why are you going to
all this trouble anyway?

18:24.323 --> 18:25.729
Uncle Mac, I got to do something.

18:26.281 --> 18:28.533
- Oh, Jacob.
- Don't I?

18:33.405 --> 18:36.648
There's no way you're ever
getting reinstated.

18:37.576 --> 18:39.878
Not with Gigi back in the pulpit.

18:40.570 --> 18:43.848
The longer you stick around
acting like you still belong

18:43.883 --> 18:45.717
after everything you pulled?

18:45.751 --> 18:48.253
It just looks desperate.

18:48.287 --> 18:49.420
You're still here.

18:55.227 --> 18:57.825
Like I said, go for it.

18:59.231 --> 19:02.233
Obviously, you know what you're doing.

19:10.576 --> 19:11.334
Hello?

19:11.369 --> 19:12.944
This Isabel? It's Mac.

19:12.978 --> 19:15.713
Oh, hi. Is everything okay?

19:15.748 --> 19:17.215
Yeah, everything is fine.

19:17.249 --> 19:19.317
Uh, Noah should be back there soon.

19:19.351 --> 19:20.852
I'm calling for you, actually.

19:20.886 --> 19:22.218
What about?

19:22.588 --> 19:23.821
I just wanted to say,

19:23.856 --> 19:25.924
I heard about that cake
you been jonesing for.

19:26.831 --> 19:29.760
Yeah, yeah. We decided it's too much.

19:29.795 --> 19:31.696
Well, hang on, hang on.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.698
I've been going crazy over here

19:33.732 --> 19:36.201
trying to figure out
what to get you two.

19:36.235 --> 19:38.203
And now the wedding's two weeks away,

19:38.237 --> 19:42.124
and I can, uh, give you that cake.

19:42.158 --> 19:43.557
It's $800.

19:43.591 --> 19:45.748
I know. I heard all about it.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.347
Come on. Let me do it.

19:50.219 --> 19:51.549
It'll make me happy.

19:51.584 --> 19:53.618
You order what you want

19:53.652 --> 19:56.100
and have them send the bill to me.

19:56.889 --> 19:58.985
It'll be our little secret.

20:00.226 --> 20:02.227
Okay, I guess.

20:02.262 --> 20:03.777
Thank you.

20:04.144 --> 20:05.296
My pleasure.

20:14.573 --> 20:17.375
Hello? Yes, ma'am.

20:17.684 --> 20:19.309
Yeah, I'll be right there.

20:26.518 --> 20:29.246
- What's the problem now?
- There's no problem.

20:29.280 --> 20:31.522
We're just going through the
minutes that you supplied us.

20:31.834 --> 20:33.491
Thank you so much for getting
them to us so quickly.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.979
That's why I'm here.

20:35.394 --> 20:37.829
It's just this phrase "love offerings"

20:37.863 --> 20:39.530
that comes up so frequently.

20:39.565 --> 20:41.766
- Mm-hmm.
- What are they, exactly?

20:41.800 --> 20:43.534
Every three months the people bless

20:43.569 --> 20:44.702
the bishop with cash gifts

20:44.737 --> 20:47.670
over and above their weekly tithe.

20:47.704 --> 20:48.683
And how does that work?

20:48.718 --> 20:49.774
Do they pass a plate through the pews?

20:49.808 --> 20:52.914
A second time, mm-hmm. It's a gift.

20:53.808 --> 20:54.712
Okay.

20:54.747 --> 20:55.913
I guess there is a problem.

20:55.948 --> 20:58.716
According to Section 102...

20:58.751 --> 21:00.618
Section 102 has been amended.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.354
You're aware of that, right?

21:03.756 --> 21:07.358
It now states that any amount
transferred by or for any employer

21:07.393 --> 21:09.927
to or for the benefit of an employee

21:09.962 --> 21:11.743
can't be counted as a gift.

21:11.778 --> 21:13.364
That's all income.

21:13.399 --> 21:16.200
Does the bishop report
love offerings as income?

21:16.235 --> 21:18.369
I can check with our treasurer,

21:18.404 --> 21:20.584
but I'm pretty sure he does, yes.

21:20.609 --> 21:21.839
All right, see,

21:21.874 --> 21:24.375
we're going to need to see
his personal tax returns

21:24.410 --> 21:25.510
for the last three years.

21:25.544 --> 21:27.845
- Okay.
- Just to, you know,

21:27.880 --> 21:29.547
make sure they reconcile
with the statements

21:29.581 --> 21:31.846
made by the deacons in the minutes.

21:32.254 --> 21:33.587
I'll get right on that.

21:34.002 --> 21:35.553
No, it's all right, Mr. McCready.

21:35.587 --> 21:36.888
We'll take it from here.

21:44.909 --> 21:46.505
You need to stay out of my way.

21:46.933 --> 21:48.365
What are you talking about?

21:48.400 --> 21:49.300
I mean it. Stay out of my way.

21:49.335 --> 21:50.468
You can get out of my office now.

21:50.502 --> 21:51.836
You went behind my back to the auditor.

21:51.870 --> 21:52.837
I don't know what you told them,

21:52.871 --> 21:54.372
but you better realize,

21:54.406 --> 21:56.207
you start pulling threads
to get to me, girl,

21:56.241 --> 21:57.842
you going to unravel the whole thing...

21:57.876 --> 22:00.912
- the whole damn thing!
- The auditor came to me.

22:00.946 --> 22:04.074
- Mm-hmm. For what? Go ahead?
- Something confidential.

22:04.108 --> 22:06.625
Don't pull that with me. You're
no more a pastor than I am!

22:06.730 --> 22:08.912
What about? What did you
talk to her about?!

22:10.793 --> 22:13.019
She has a son who lost
his legs in the Army.

22:13.053 --> 22:15.786
She wanted to know if we had any
programs for disabled vets.

22:21.236 --> 22:22.236
Everything okay in here?

22:27.242 --> 22:28.242
You don't know.

22:29.122 --> 22:30.912
I do, though.

22:32.247 --> 22:33.280
I know everything.

22:33.314 --> 22:34.706
You don't know!

22:35.250 --> 22:36.917
And you don't know what you don't know.

22:39.788 --> 22:41.789
Stay the hell out of my business.

23:17.759 --> 23:18.859
Mr. McCready?

23:18.893 --> 23:20.779
The camera crew is here
for "Memphis Morning."

23:20.804 --> 23:22.015
They're ready for you.

23:26.921 --> 23:27.988
All right.

23:36.115 --> 23:38.628
Fact here is, lots of good lawyers

23:38.713 --> 23:40.713
are working hard to help people

23:40.965 --> 23:43.033
making sure the system
works for everybody.

23:43.514 --> 23:46.209
I'm grateful just to be
counted in their company.

23:46.234 --> 23:48.485
Well, that's predictably gracious.

23:48.519 --> 23:51.288
Well, even more than
that, though, Denise,

23:51.322 --> 23:53.623
I have to give credit to the Lord.

23:54.239 --> 23:55.358
I hope that's okay.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.693
We know you're a man of faith,

23:56.727 --> 23:58.461
Mr. McCready. Go ahead, preach.

23:58.496 --> 23:59.763
No, no. I'm not going to preach.

23:59.797 --> 24:01.197
I just want to say, you know,

24:01.232 --> 24:04.034
there but for the grace of God go I.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.335
That's all.

24:05.369 --> 24:07.304
One last question, Mr. McCready.

24:07.338 --> 24:09.706
Okay. I got a lot to wrap up
before they let me go.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.141
Oh, we're sure you do.

24:11.175 --> 24:12.642
Now, to the young people
out there watching

24:12.677 --> 24:14.778
who one day hope
to achieve your success,

24:14.812 --> 24:16.246
what advice do you have for them?

24:16.280 --> 24:17.374
Honestly?

24:17.815 --> 24:20.317
No one wants to hear this
because it's boring,

24:20.351 --> 24:21.626
but it's true.

24:22.353 --> 24:25.689
Read, study, stay in school.

24:25.723 --> 24:27.030
Get an education.

24:27.725 --> 24:30.627
My mama was a bear when it came
to getting my homework done,

24:30.661 --> 24:32.729
and I thank her for it
everyday in my heart.

24:32.763 --> 24:36.559
All right, then. Eileen? Back to you.

24:37.168 --> 24:38.101
Cut.

24:39.804 --> 24:41.604
What a pro. That was phenomenal.

24:41.639 --> 24:43.173
Thank you for the opportunity.

24:44.742 --> 24:46.358
Let's get out of here.

24:53.150 --> 24:54.784
Good job, Mr. McCready.

24:54.819 --> 24:56.753
Thank you.

24:56.787 --> 24:59.183
Memphis Man of the Year!

24:59.657 --> 25:02.625
- Hey there.
- Wonder if I might have a word?

25:14.171 --> 25:16.473
- What did she say?
- Not yet.

25:16.507 --> 25:18.205
I said, just wait.

25:21.512 --> 25:23.246
Karine, hold my calls.

25:38.662 --> 25:41.932
- What happened?
- Just tell me what the auditor said.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.734
You said everything
was going to be okay!

25:44.769 --> 25:48.037
Flying colors! What happened?

25:48.072 --> 25:50.774
What exactly did the auditor say?

25:50.808 --> 25:52.475
Tell me and I'll take care of it.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.144
You know I will. I always do.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.779
She wants our personal income taxes,

25:55.813 --> 25:58.397
complete with receipts,
for the last three years;

25:59.093 --> 26:00.784
an inventory of everything in our home,

26:00.818 --> 26:03.119
every God blessed object...

26:03.154 --> 26:05.755
explanations on where it all came from,

26:05.790 --> 26:08.625
and contact numbers from anyone

26:08.659 --> 26:11.261
who's even given us a ballpoint pen.

26:11.295 --> 26:13.263
Do you know what your
sister's going to do

26:13.297 --> 26:14.664
when she finds out about this?

26:16.267 --> 26:18.339
Did it ever occur to you

26:19.136 --> 26:20.437
to look at those damn minutes

26:20.471 --> 26:21.571
before you handed them over to her?

26:21.605 --> 26:23.875
- I did look at them.
- And?

26:23.910 --> 26:26.572
And I... I...

26:27.144 --> 26:28.711
I misunderstood one thing.

26:28.746 --> 26:33.854
No, you misunderstood
more than just one thing.

26:36.326 --> 26:37.760
When were you going to tell me?

26:40.060 --> 26:41.257
After they put me in prison?

26:41.292 --> 26:42.559
The reporter showed up.

26:42.593 --> 26:43.560
I was going to come down
as soon as I finished.

26:43.594 --> 26:45.301
I don't want to hear it!

26:48.884 --> 26:50.885
Memphis Man of the Year.

26:55.639 --> 26:57.740
If you spent half the time
doing your job

26:57.775 --> 26:59.742
that you spend wandering all over town

26:59.777 --> 27:02.567
looking for people to save...

27:19.296 --> 27:21.234
I'm going to give you one day.

27:21.798 --> 27:22.865
I won't tell Mae.

27:25.469 --> 27:27.889
I'm going to give you
one day to make this right.

27:28.832 --> 27:29.972
I'll take care of it.

27:30.007 --> 27:32.329
Don't tell me you're going
to take care of it.

27:33.193 --> 27:34.664
You just take care of it.

27:35.590 --> 27:37.747
I will not have people
going through our lives

27:37.781 --> 27:39.516
with a fine-toothed comb.

27:40.287 --> 27:42.585
We both know that won't be good.

27:44.126 --> 27:45.522
Now, get out.

28:31.135 --> 28:32.201
Hello?

28:39.276 --> 28:40.944
We'll see what he says.

28:40.978 --> 28:42.946
Well, Carlton says he'll take it.

28:42.980 --> 28:44.948
- Good.
- But I don't like it.

28:44.982 --> 28:47.116
- Charity...
- I want you to hire him

28:47.151 --> 28:48.785
as a full employee with full benefits.

28:48.819 --> 28:50.167
This is not the time.

28:50.621 --> 28:52.696
I'm not going to be party
to discrimination.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.924
He's a talented man, and
whether you or Kevin think...

28:54.959 --> 28:56.868
Then hire him! Do what you want!

28:57.615 --> 28:58.581
I will.

29:01.131 --> 29:04.534
- What's that sound?
- I don't know.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.301
- Come on.
- Mr. McCready, you can't be here.

29:06.335 --> 29:08.071
- Let me talk to my son.
- Just listen to me.

29:08.105 --> 29:09.205
- Now, you have to leave.
- What's happening?

29:09.239 --> 29:10.607
I'm sorry, Mr. McCready.

29:10.641 --> 29:12.108
I told him he could not come in.

29:12.142 --> 29:13.646
Did you put your hands on my father?

29:13.680 --> 29:15.478
No. He looked that way
when he showed up.

29:15.512 --> 29:16.613
I didn't know what to do.

29:16.647 --> 29:17.580
Mr. McCready, your daughter
doesn't want you here.

29:17.615 --> 29:18.881
Now, you know that.

29:18.916 --> 29:22.919
My daughter is a high yellow whore!

29:22.953 --> 29:25.088
- Daddy, Daddy.
- She ain't even mine!

29:25.122 --> 29:27.523
- Listen, Mae. Now, hold on.
- I'm sick of this.

29:27.558 --> 29:29.058
You better, or I'll have
to call the cops.

29:29.093 --> 29:30.526
Nobody's calling any cops.

29:30.561 --> 29:31.828
Come on, Daddy.
You got to get out of here.

29:31.862 --> 29:33.162
I just got to get some more money.

29:33.197 --> 29:34.697
I can't give you any more money.
Come on.

29:34.732 --> 29:36.532
This son of a bitch,

29:36.567 --> 29:38.927
if I don't give him something,
I'm in trouble.

29:39.803 --> 29:40.937
How much you need?

29:40.971 --> 29:42.647
Don't you dare give him a cent!

29:43.140 --> 29:44.952
What's the matter with you?

29:45.576 --> 29:48.611
You leave this church right now.

29:48.646 --> 29:51.216
This is a house of God,
and you don't belong here.

29:54.284 --> 29:55.551
Daddy, please.

29:58.635 --> 30:02.071
I cast you down in the
almighty name of Jesus!

30:02.259 --> 30:04.060
Leave! You have no place here, Daddy.

30:11.528 --> 30:12.639
Noah...

30:14.538 --> 30:15.505
call the police.

30:15.539 --> 30:18.199
Don't. Don't call them.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.610
I'm going.

30:25.616 --> 30:28.049
Come on, boy. You know the deal.

30:28.752 --> 30:30.486
Let me have the money.

30:30.521 --> 30:33.156
- Don't you do it.
- Come on.

30:33.190 --> 30:35.191
Just give me whatever you can

30:35.225 --> 30:37.860
and I'll, uh...
I'll figure out the rest.

30:37.895 --> 30:39.996
Mac, I said don't do it!

30:40.030 --> 30:41.164
Thank you, I just...

30:41.198 --> 30:43.152
thank you, boy.

30:43.934 --> 30:45.501
Okay.

30:55.440 --> 30:57.341
Evening, Mr. Mac.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.653
How'd it go?

30:59.077 --> 31:00.344
I was about to ask you the same thing.

31:00.378 --> 31:03.180
- Well...
- Oh, very nice.

31:03.214 --> 31:05.048
You couldn't get off?

31:05.083 --> 31:06.683
Oh, no, we're going to New
Orleans for the weekend.

31:06.719 --> 31:08.553
- It's all good.
- All right.

31:08.587 --> 31:09.687
It's not like I ain't going to see him

31:09.722 --> 31:12.056
when I get home anyway, you know?

31:12.091 --> 31:13.958
When are we going to get you married?

31:13.993 --> 31:16.060
I tried it once. Didn't take.

31:16.095 --> 31:18.262
- Oh. Mmm.
- No, ma'am.

31:19.565 --> 31:20.532
Look who's down here again.

31:20.566 --> 31:21.717
Hmm?

31:22.750 --> 31:24.301
How long has she been down here?

31:24.336 --> 31:25.537
Couple hours.

31:27.701 --> 31:30.073
Can't you do anything to help her mom?

31:30.109 --> 31:32.610
It seems like you can fix
everyone else here in Memphis.

31:32.645 --> 31:35.547
Yeah, we can't help folks
unless they want to be helped.

31:35.581 --> 31:36.966
I guess.

31:37.716 --> 31:41.770
It's just so sad to see a
girl like that so unhappy.

31:42.677 --> 31:46.089
- How was Morgan Freeman?
- Very inspiring.

31:46.125 --> 31:48.560
- I'd better get going. Good night.
- Good night.

31:56.602 --> 31:59.259
Come on. Let's get you home.

32:18.257 --> 32:21.225
Yours is so much nicer than ours.

32:21.260 --> 32:22.560
No kids.

32:24.430 --> 32:26.404
Go on in. I'll be right there.

32:29.268 --> 32:31.108
What happened tonight?

32:32.104 --> 32:33.705
She won't let me drive.

32:33.739 --> 32:35.724
I didn't know you had a license.

32:36.442 --> 32:37.475
Got a permit.

32:41.246 --> 32:42.280
What do you want to drink?

32:43.829 --> 32:45.149
What do you have?

32:45.468 --> 32:46.684
Well, I'm having whiskey,

32:46.719 --> 32:48.686
but I'm not giving you
anything like that.

32:48.721 --> 32:51.155
My mom lets me drink sometimes.

32:51.190 --> 32:52.457
Ginger ale or Coke?

32:53.291 --> 32:55.627
Coke. Fine.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.219
You don't seem very happy

33:22.254 --> 33:24.322
for someone who just won a big award.

33:26.592 --> 33:28.311
Guess I'm not, really.

33:29.537 --> 33:31.229
It's a pretty rotten thing
to do to be an adult

33:31.263 --> 33:33.231
and be able to do all the
things that kids can't do

33:33.265 --> 33:34.632
and not even be happy about it.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.389
It kind of just makes me want
to commit suicide right now.

33:41.440 --> 33:44.642
- I tried that once.
- Seriously?

33:46.423 --> 33:47.478
Yeah.

33:50.817 --> 33:52.150
Hang on a second.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.624
I was thinking about you today.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.505
Ever since I saw you the first time,

34:14.540 --> 34:17.175
I've been thinking that you
remind me of someone I've met.

34:17.984 --> 34:19.210
- Me?
- Mm-hmm.

34:19.244 --> 34:20.645
But then it hit me today.

34:20.679 --> 34:22.741
It's not anybody I've met.

34:23.215 --> 34:27.284
It's this girl in this painting.

34:31.096 --> 34:33.190
She's beautiful.

34:33.225 --> 34:34.592
Yeah.

34:36.096 --> 34:38.161
Anyway...

34:40.666 --> 34:42.166
Are you trying to get me in trouble?

34:42.201 --> 34:44.489
Just a little.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.582
Why did you try to kill yourself?

34:58.313 --> 35:00.648
I wasn't happy.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.054
When did you do it?

35:04.472 --> 35:06.057
When I was about 12.

35:07.034 --> 35:08.792
That's so sad.

35:10.696 --> 35:16.667
Yeah, but no sadder than you sitting
down in that lobby every night.

35:16.702 --> 35:18.069
I'm all right.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.028
Why did you want to die?

35:35.148 --> 35:37.099
If you don't want to
talk about it, I get it.

35:38.252 --> 35:39.290
We can just sit here.

35:42.394 --> 35:43.961
Hmm.

35:46.064 --> 35:49.061
My mama died and I
thought it was my fault.

35:51.004 --> 35:55.005
After my daddy left, she
started to drink too much.

35:56.419 --> 35:58.108
And my sisters were both
gone by that point.

35:58.143 --> 35:59.577
It was just her and me.

36:00.275 --> 36:02.757
She always used to tell me
I was the man of the house.

36:03.548 --> 36:05.650
Mama's man of the house.

36:06.043 --> 36:08.881
That was just her way
of saying "do everything."

36:09.971 --> 36:12.356
I'd come home from school,
have to make dinner

36:12.391 --> 36:14.192
and do the dishes and do the wash.

36:14.547 --> 36:16.193
She'd just sit out on the porch

36:16.228 --> 36:17.528
with her friend Joann,

36:17.563 --> 36:19.365
complaining about Daddy.

36:21.715 --> 36:23.367
Anyway, by the time I turned 12,

36:23.402 --> 36:27.138
I got a girlfriend... Missy.

36:29.860 --> 36:31.444
Does she look like her?

36:32.475 --> 36:34.212
Well, she did a little.

36:35.948 --> 36:37.080
Anyhow, Mama didn't like that...

36:37.115 --> 36:40.611
me not being available
to wait on her hand and foot.

36:42.054 --> 36:45.539
I came in one night after
taking a walk with Missy,

36:46.692 --> 36:48.192
and Mama, when I walked
through the door,

36:48.227 --> 36:50.027
she dragged me in the kitchen

36:50.062 --> 36:51.362
and made me stand there

36:51.396 --> 36:53.197
while she pulled everything
out of the cupboards

36:53.232 --> 36:54.532
and threw it all on the floor

36:54.566 --> 36:56.634
and said, "Clean it up."

36:57.564 --> 36:58.970
What did you do?

37:01.073 --> 37:02.473
I said no.

37:06.444 --> 37:07.612
She just left.

37:09.802 --> 37:11.348
A couple hours later,
the cops showed up.

37:11.383 --> 37:15.186
She had gone out and gotten drunk

37:15.220 --> 37:19.040
and was walking home
across the railroad tracks

37:19.074 --> 37:20.645
at the north end of town.

37:20.679 --> 37:22.498
There was a train stopped on the track,

37:22.532 --> 37:24.988
and I guess she must have
thought it was safe to cross.

37:25.828 --> 37:29.103
But there was another train
on the track behind

37:29.137 --> 37:30.334
she didn't see coming.

37:45.113 --> 37:47.184
- Hello?
- Uncle Mac?

37:47.219 --> 37:49.904
Yeah? It's late.

37:49.938 --> 37:51.522
Yeah, I'm sorry.

37:51.556 --> 37:53.224
Uncle Mac, I just wanted to say

37:53.258 --> 37:55.718
that I'm sorry about what
I said at lunch today.

37:56.286 --> 37:57.821
I didn't mean nothing by it.

37:58.230 --> 38:01.014
Um, you know, we all know...

38:02.701 --> 38:06.537
we all know the whole thing
with Faith was a mess.

38:07.013 --> 38:08.246
Um...

38:09.408 --> 38:10.975
I'm just not in a good place right now.

38:11.797 --> 38:15.012
- That's okay.
- No, it's not.

38:15.373 --> 38:17.102
And I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

38:17.136 --> 38:18.559
Well, thank you.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.453
I'm still going to talk
to Pop about the plan.

38:22.487 --> 38:24.221
I know you don't think
it's a good idea...

38:24.256 --> 38:25.489
No, no, I think it's a good idea.

38:25.524 --> 38:27.869
I just know he thinks it's bad.

38:27.904 --> 38:29.239
Well, anyway,

38:29.274 --> 38:31.357
I just hope you won't, you know...

38:31.382 --> 38:32.628
I'll stay out of it.

38:32.662 --> 38:35.723
But if it looks like he might go for it

38:35.757 --> 38:37.452
and you need me to take it
across the finish line,

38:37.496 --> 38:38.429
you just let me know.

38:40.064 --> 38:41.342
All right, thanks, Uncle Mac, really.

38:41.376 --> 38:43.162
Yeah, no problem.

38:44.146 --> 38:45.466
And, um...

38:46.686 --> 38:47.786
thanks for understanding.

38:47.821 --> 38:48.787
You got it.

38:48.822 --> 38:51.623
Tell Kerissa I said great job

38:51.658 --> 38:52.724
with the presentation.

38:54.828 --> 38:56.522
Uncle Mac said nice job.

38:57.130 --> 38:58.657
Thank you, Uncle Mac.

38:59.666 --> 39:01.091
She said thank you.

39:01.501 --> 39:03.563
All right, then, Junior. Night.

39:04.671 --> 39:05.699
Good night.

39:13.146 --> 39:14.413
Thank you.

39:22.047 --> 39:23.672
It's not your fault.

39:23.803 --> 39:25.449
Yeah.

39:25.474 --> 39:27.295
I didn't know that then.

39:32.131 --> 39:33.939
How did you try to kill yourself?

39:34.034 --> 39:36.040
We don't need to talk about that.

39:37.052 --> 39:39.923
I've been listening to
stories about me all night.

39:40.723 --> 39:43.157
- Let's talk about you.
- I'm boring.

39:43.192 --> 39:44.859
I find that hard to believe.

39:44.894 --> 39:46.288
It's true.

39:47.196 --> 39:48.696
I'm sure the girl in the picture

39:48.731 --> 39:50.398
is ten times more interesting than me.

39:50.863 --> 39:52.165
She's long gone.

39:52.201 --> 39:53.600
You're here.

39:54.203 --> 39:55.937
I think that gives you an advantage.

39:59.475 --> 40:02.810
All right, just a taste.
