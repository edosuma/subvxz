WEBVTT

00:00.901 --> 00:02.402
Last season
on the practice...

00:02.435 --> 00:03.403
Aah!

00:03.436 --> 00:04.505
What?

00:04.538 --> 00:05.772
There's a head
in the bag!

00:05.806 --> 00:07.107
The woman I met last night.

00:07.140 --> 00:08.642
What are you doing
with her head?

00:08.675 --> 00:09.710
Somebody put it there.

00:09.743 --> 00:11.111
George Vogelman, you are
under arrest

00:11.144 --> 00:13.046
for the murder
of Susan Robin.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.248
We both know I've always
had some motive

00:15.281 --> 00:16.683
to tell you I'm innocent,

00:16.717 --> 00:19.285
but now, the evidence
being closed,

00:19.319 --> 00:23.524
it doesn't matter
what I tell you.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.059
I didn't do it.

00:28.494 --> 00:30.430
MAN: We find the defendant,
George Vogelman,

00:30.463 --> 00:34.300
not guilty.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.541
(gasps)

00:40.574 --> 00:42.308
Ugh!

00:42.342 --> 00:45.478
Some guy stabbed me.

00:45.512 --> 00:49.349
Guy? You said --
you said "nun."

00:49.382 --> 00:55.221
It was a guy
in a nun suit.

00:59.325 --> 01:02.362
Is it really so terrible
if they see the videotape?

01:02.395 --> 01:03.697
It ain't great.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.832
We don't want the jury
inflamed over the images.

01:05.866 --> 01:07.367
We better get going.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.702
We're all set.

01:08.735 --> 01:09.836
Where's your wife?

01:09.870 --> 01:11.705
Jimmy said
we didn't need her.

01:11.738 --> 01:12.673
It's just a hearing.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.509
I want her there for trial.
Your kids, too.

01:15.542 --> 01:18.545
We're going to be late.
Let's go.

01:22.816 --> 01:23.784
Thank you.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.185
You're welcome.

01:25.218 --> 01:26.419
Elleanor?

01:28.622 --> 01:31.658
George, hey.

01:31.692 --> 01:34.127
My co-op association
just evicted me

01:34.160 --> 01:36.129
on grounds
of moral turpitude.

01:36.162 --> 01:38.464
-Excuse me?
-They're saying even though
I was acquitted

01:38.498 --> 01:40.333
in the Susan Robin case,

01:40.366 --> 01:42.803
in their minds it isn't clear
that I'm innocent,

01:42.836 --> 01:44.805
and they voted me out.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.473
How many times
do I have to keep paying

01:47.508 --> 01:49.342
for something I didn't do?

01:49.375 --> 01:50.877
They evicted you
from the building?

01:50.911 --> 01:53.747
30 days notice.
Is this legal?

01:53.780 --> 01:55.882
I wouldn't want a killer
on my floor.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.751
-Lucy.
-Well, not that you are one.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.787
George,
I'm just saying that...

02:00.821 --> 02:03.289
Will you represent me,
Elleanor?

02:03.323 --> 02:05.826
I know it's not
a big case, but --

02:05.859 --> 02:08.127
I brought my lease
with me.

02:11.331 --> 02:13.166
Okay. Sure.

02:13.199 --> 02:15.636
In the conference room,
we'll review it.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.672
Thank you.
I feel better already.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.208
He's back.

02:23.944 --> 02:27.147
â™ª

03:12.458 --> 03:15.428
This is how
she was found, your honor.

03:15.461 --> 03:16.462
You can see the slight
bruising on her neck.

03:16.496 --> 03:19.399
This is how the police
found her?

03:19.432 --> 03:20.801
They hadn't moved her.

03:20.834 --> 03:24.304
Okay, here.
Now, this isn't blood.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.672
It's grape jelly.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.807
Grape jelly?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.308
Yes, your honor.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.843
What else?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.679
That's it. 30 seconds
of footage, tops.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.848
That footage
is so inflammatory --

03:34.881 --> 03:37.584
it goes to what
the scene looked like.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.586
Why can't the jury
be allowed --

03:39.620 --> 03:40.721
they'll look at that
and be horrified

03:40.754 --> 03:42.556
and decide someone's
got to pay.

03:42.589 --> 03:43.757
You know what?

03:43.790 --> 03:46.326
This idea that we have to
shelter juries from the truth,

03:46.359 --> 03:47.928
that was started
by defense attorneys.

03:47.961 --> 03:50.697
-Already with the speeches.
We haven't even begun.
-You think that's a speech?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.132
All right.

03:52.165 --> 03:54.735
Your honor I have no
intention of getting on a
soapbox believe me,

03:54.768 --> 03:57.838
but how did it happen
that we became afraid

03:57.871 --> 04:00.006
of letting juries
see things for themselves?

04:00.040 --> 04:02.475
This footage describes
the scene more accurately

04:02.509 --> 04:04.310
than could any
testimonial account.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.012
This system
is supposed to be

04:06.046 --> 04:07.614
about arriving
at the truth.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.616
I don't see why
the straightest-line approach

04:09.650 --> 04:11.618
should be eliminated
from the process.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.053
We cling to this notion

04:13.086 --> 04:15.522
that the jury system
is the best in the world,

04:15.556 --> 04:18.058
all the while
we don't trust them.
It is absurd it is indecent

04:18.091 --> 04:20.894
It is an insult
to this room

04:20.927 --> 04:23.530
and to the people in the name of
civic duty who sit in that box.

04:23.564 --> 04:26.900
Yes, and I'm so glad you left
your soapbox at home.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.802
The issue
before this court goes

04:28.835 --> 04:31.471
to whether or not my client
committed the crime.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.674
The district attorney,
by his own admission,

04:33.707 --> 04:35.375
agrees this footage
doesn't speak to that.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.677
We've stipulated
to strangulation --

04:36.710 --> 04:38.378
I'm not offering --

04:38.411 --> 04:39.780
can I finish?

04:39.813 --> 04:42.082
You don't need to finish we
already know what you're going
to say.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.084
You got a sick depraved,
murdering client like always,

04:44.117 --> 04:45.952
and like always,

04:45.986 --> 04:48.655
the more truth you can keep
under wraps, the better.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.657
It is a disgrace regularly
visited upon this room

04:50.691 --> 04:52.959
by you and every other
defense attorney.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.695
Napoleon complex, your honor --

04:54.728 --> 04:56.563
res ipsa pipsqueak.

04:56.597 --> 04:58.398
All right.

04:58.431 --> 05:01.434
The videotape is allowed.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.570
Whatever's between
the two of you,

05:03.604 --> 05:06.006
keep it out of the room.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.109
We'll bring the jury in
at 11:00.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.578
Do you really think
that was necessary?

05:11.612 --> 05:13.580
Yes.
Any word from Rebecca?

05:13.614 --> 05:16.550
The sister agreed
to at least talk to her.
She should be there now.

05:16.583 --> 05:17.818
Where's your family?

05:17.851 --> 05:19.720
My wife and son
are coming.

05:19.753 --> 05:21.555
My daughter's 11.
I don't want her here.

05:21.588 --> 05:23.456
Call me a pipsqueak?

05:23.489 --> 05:24.891
Get away from me, Richard,
before I trip over you.

05:24.925 --> 05:26.627
LINDSAY: All right.

05:26.660 --> 05:27.994
I'll get you, Donnell.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.697
I'll get your client,
I'll get you.

05:30.731 --> 05:33.099
Richard,
what are you doing?

05:33.133 --> 05:35.569
He called me a pipsqueak
in open court.

05:35.602 --> 05:37.571
Richard,
you're a district attorney.

05:37.604 --> 05:40.106
You can't be yelling
"I'll get you"

05:40.140 --> 05:42.743
to defense lawyers
in the corridor.

05:42.776 --> 05:44.578
How's the case?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.880
Circumstantial but tight,
although you never know

05:46.913 --> 05:49.616
what your little friends
are going to pull.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.818
Just don't be screaming
at them

05:51.852 --> 05:53.119
in the corridor,
all right?

05:53.153 --> 05:54.487
All right.

05:55.922 --> 05:58.592
Call me a pipsqueak.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.595
This man
was judged innocent.

06:01.628 --> 06:02.963
So was O. J. Simpson,

06:02.996 --> 06:05.165
but that doesn't mean
a co-op has to welcome --

06:05.198 --> 06:07.501
How many times does he have
to be victimized?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.003
First he's put on trial,
and after an acquittal,

06:10.036 --> 06:12.773
the police plant a knife
in my office trying to
get him again.

06:12.806 --> 06:15.742
The reason the police did that
because they remain convinced

06:15.776 --> 06:18.645
that he cut off
a woman's head.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.647
He's supposed
to walk around branded?

06:20.681 --> 06:22.482
I sympathize, counsel,

06:22.516 --> 06:24.651
but an acquittal
in a criminal trial

06:24.685 --> 06:26.520
does not add up
to innocence.

06:26.553 --> 06:28.054
It simply means
that the state

06:28.088 --> 06:30.190
couldn't make
its burden of proof.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.191
How about O. J. Simpson?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.794
Do you think that a co-op
should be required

06:33.827 --> 06:35.662
to keep him as a member?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.931
First of all, O. J. Simpson
was found guilty

06:37.964 --> 06:39.499
in a civil trial.

06:39.533 --> 06:42.068
As Mr. Vogelman probably
would be if a civil trial --

06:42.102 --> 06:43.670
you don't know that.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.072
Look, he could be
a very nice man who,

06:46.106 --> 06:47.908
by coincidence,
happened to have

06:47.941 --> 06:50.210
a human head pop out
of his medical bag,

06:50.243 --> 06:52.813
but people in the building
have started to move out

06:52.846 --> 06:54.681
since he moved in.

06:54.715 --> 06:55.949
They feel threatened.
And by the way

06:55.982 --> 06:57.918
co-ops have always
been allowed

06:57.951 --> 07:00.053
to pick and choose
their members.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.688
They're not allowed
to discriminate.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.690
No, if he were being heaved

07:03.724 --> 07:06.226
because of the color
of his skin,

07:06.259 --> 07:09.195
because of his religion,
he'd have a case.

07:09.229 --> 07:11.932
But we're certainly allowed
to ask on the application,

07:11.965 --> 07:14.568
"have you ever been charged
with a decapitation?"

07:14.601 --> 07:17.203
Maybe it was a mistake
to leave that question off.

07:17.237 --> 07:18.204
You think you're funny?

07:18.238 --> 07:19.840
Would you live in the
same building as him?

07:19.873 --> 07:23.944
Alright, I'll take it
under advisement.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.713
Give me till
the morning -- 10:00.

07:31.251 --> 07:33.219
How dare you ask me that?

07:33.253 --> 07:35.556
I understand
this is difficult.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.823
My sister is murdered,

07:36.857 --> 07:39.993
and, what, you plan
to put her on trial?

07:40.026 --> 07:42.729
Ms. Poole, The prosecution
thinks there was
something going on

07:42.763 --> 07:44.731
between your sister
and Dr. Olson.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.868
There wasn't. She liked
clean teeth, he's a dentist.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.870
Ok, then Is it possible
she could have been

07:49.903 --> 07:51.872
having an affair
with somebody else?

07:51.905 --> 07:52.873
No.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.107
What about her ex-husband?

07:54.140 --> 07:56.009
Your client killed her,
Ms. Washington.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.878
He was obsessed with her,

07:57.911 --> 08:00.614
and he killed her because
she wasn't interested in him,

08:00.647 --> 08:04.718
and I can't believe you
actually expect me to help you.

08:04.751 --> 08:06.753
Did your sister
like bugs?

08:09.189 --> 08:10.724
Excuse me?

08:10.757 --> 08:12.726
There was a container
filled with bugs, cockroaches.

08:12.759 --> 08:14.728
It was found
at the scene.

08:14.761 --> 08:17.263
The police don't know
how it got there.

08:17.297 --> 08:19.766
Did she like bugs?

08:22.168 --> 08:24.304
And no other fingerprints
belonged to anybody

08:24.337 --> 08:26.306
other than the victim
or the defendant.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.041
What else did you find,
detective?

08:28.074 --> 08:30.644
We retrieved a pair
of latex gloves

08:30.677 --> 08:32.145
from a trash container.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.616
DNA analysis revealed they
were worn by the defendant.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.784
The DNA samples were...

08:37.818 --> 08:41.254
Oils from skin flakes
on the inside of the gloves.

08:41.287 --> 08:44.290
And on the outside
of the gloves?

08:44.324 --> 08:47.060
Skin secretions
from the victim

08:47.093 --> 08:49.162
and traces of grape jelly.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.064
Grape jelly?

08:51.097 --> 08:53.934
Yes. Her mouth was filled
with grape jelly.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.637
Anything else, detective?

08:56.670 --> 08:59.640
We found several pictures
of the victim

08:59.673 --> 09:00.941
in the defendant's desk.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.315
Who called you
and reported this crime?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.316
Dr. Olson.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.652
When you got there,

09:11.685 --> 09:14.688
did he tell you he tried
to clear her airways
when he walked in,

09:14.721 --> 09:16.690
discovering
her mouth all clogged?

09:16.723 --> 09:18.692
He said that, yes.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.060
If somebody reached in

09:20.093 --> 09:22.062
to clear
Ms. Poole's mouth out,

09:22.095 --> 09:25.165
he'd get jelly on his hands
or gloves, don't you think?

09:25.198 --> 09:26.700
Objection -- speculation.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.835
We're only here
because of speculation.

09:28.869 --> 09:31.104
Sustained. Let's move on.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.707
Detective, are you aware
that Ms. Poole

09:33.740 --> 09:36.810
sought and obtained
a restraining order

09:36.843 --> 09:37.844
against her ex-husband
two years ago?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.246
Yes. We questioned
Mr. Jenson

09:40.280 --> 09:42.816
and ruled him out
as a suspect,

09:42.849 --> 09:44.685
if that's where
you're going.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.687
You can't rule out
the possibility

09:46.720 --> 09:48.855
of somebody else coming
into that room, can you?

09:48.889 --> 09:51.257
No evidence points to anyone
other than Dr. Olson.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.259
But you can't exclude
the possibility

09:53.293 --> 09:54.327
of somebody else
coming into that room.

09:54.360 --> 09:57.731
DETECTIVE: No I can't,
but fibers from his gloves

09:57.764 --> 09:59.165
were found on her neck
and nobody else's.

09:59.199 --> 10:03.136
Yes and if my client were
performing mouth-to-mouth
resuscitation,

10:03.169 --> 10:05.405
would it be possible
for fibers of the gloves

10:05.438 --> 10:07.107
to get on
the victim's neck?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.275
I have no idea.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.044
You have no idea.

10:12.879 --> 10:15.415
Well, let's leave it at that.

10:15.448 --> 10:18.018
The detective has no idea.

10:25.892 --> 10:27.861
Do you have a second?

10:27.894 --> 10:31.031
Would this be ex parte?

10:31.064 --> 10:34.735
It may or may not be.
I'll let you be the judge.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.169
Gee, thanks.

10:36.202 --> 10:40.406
When I saw that this case
was going to your division,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.876
I thought about bringing
a motion to recuse you

10:42.909 --> 10:45.879
since both you
and George Vogelman

10:45.912 --> 10:47.881
had inadvertently been
listed as suspects

10:47.914 --> 10:49.883
after Lindsay Dole
was stabbed.

10:49.916 --> 10:53.319
I know it's not
a direct conflict, but...

10:53.353 --> 10:56.790
Well, after seeing the anger
of George Vogelman

10:56.823 --> 10:59.926
and what a false accusation
can do to a person,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.796
I have to be honest
and ask the question --

11:02.829 --> 11:05.331
can you see straight
on this issue?

11:05.365 --> 11:08.034
Can I see straight
on the issue

11:08.068 --> 11:11.938
of being falsely accused
of something?

11:11.972 --> 11:12.806
Yes.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.808
Well, if I couldn't,

11:14.841 --> 11:19.079
wouldn't my bias
run in your favor?

11:19.112 --> 11:20.814
I don't know.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.183
You don't know?

11:23.216 --> 11:25.786
Any thoughts
as to how this case

11:25.819 --> 11:28.922
ended up before me,
counsel?

11:28.955 --> 11:32.926
It's because you went
to the favor bank

11:32.959 --> 11:35.796
and you asked a certain
clerk named Benny

11:35.829 --> 11:39.365
to make sure this case
dropped into my lap,

11:39.399 --> 11:42.969
figuring my bias
would work for you.

11:43.003 --> 11:48.241
I see a lot straighter
than I'm given credit for.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.843
As I said,

11:49.876 --> 11:52.345
I will take the matter
under advisement.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.847
In the meantime,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.382
get your ass out
of my chambers.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.898
She would come in
twice a week

12:11.932 --> 12:13.433
to have
her teeth cleaned.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.835
Every week?

12:14.868 --> 12:16.102
Yes.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.905
She had this compulsive
thing about her teeth.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.241
She'd brush them
12 times a day

12:21.274 --> 12:23.777
and come in twice a week
for plaque removal.

12:23.810 --> 12:26.246
Were you ever there
for any of these cleanings?

12:26.279 --> 12:29.182
No. He did them himself,
which was odd.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.317
I'm the hygienist.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.386
He wanted to do them.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.388
Yes, then he started
scheduling her

12:35.421 --> 12:37.057
for early mornings,

12:37.090 --> 12:39.059
before the office
was even open.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.563
Did you ever witness any
of these early encounters?

12:42.596 --> 12:44.865
One time I came in early.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.867
The door
to the examination room

12:46.900 --> 12:48.334
slammed shut in a hurry.

12:48.368 --> 12:52.405
Dr. Olson then told me
I was never to come in early

12:52.438 --> 12:53.940
like that again.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.876
Did you find this strange?

12:55.909 --> 12:56.843
Of course,

12:56.877 --> 12:59.546
but I found the whole thing
very strange.

12:59.580 --> 13:02.015
Anything else
you find strange?

13:02.048 --> 13:03.950
Well...

13:03.984 --> 13:06.286
I'm also in charge
of accounts receivable.

13:06.319 --> 13:08.955
He instructed me
not to bill her.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.424
Two visits a week
for over a year --

13:11.457 --> 13:14.294
that's a lot of time
not billed.

13:14.327 --> 13:17.097
BOBBY: So if I'm clear,
the crux of your testimony

13:17.130 --> 13:19.432
is that he cleaned
her teeth twice a week

13:19.465 --> 13:21.902
early in the morning
and didn't bill her,

13:21.935 --> 13:23.369
and you found that strange.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.505
Basically.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.906
Thank you.

13:25.939 --> 13:27.908
Do you have any reason
to believe

13:27.941 --> 13:30.043
that she wasn't really
getting her teeth cleaned
on these visits?

13:30.076 --> 13:32.913
No, I believe she was
getting them cleaned.

13:32.946 --> 13:35.315
She had this thing
about it.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.351
Thank you, Ms. Heinz.
That's all.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.588
You got no case.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.924
Gee, I guess I should
just give up then.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.391
You got fingerprints
and a suspicious hygienist.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.393
I got two people
in a room,

13:47.427 --> 13:48.929
one ends up strangled.

13:48.962 --> 13:50.063
What's that, suicide?

13:50.096 --> 13:51.998
You've got no case.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.333
Mr. Donnell?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.001
I'm Bob Jenson.

13:55.035 --> 13:57.070
I used to be married
to the woman who was killed,

13:57.103 --> 13:58.872
and I don't appreciate
your innuendo

13:58.905 --> 14:00.406
that I might be a suspect.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.942
Mr. Jenson, I sympathize

14:01.975 --> 14:03.644
with the loss
of your ex-wife,

14:03.677 --> 14:05.946
but this
is a murder trial.

14:05.979 --> 14:08.414
If your feelings
get easily hurt in there,

14:08.448 --> 14:10.283
I'd stay out of the room.

14:10.316 --> 14:14.420
What's with these people?

14:14.454 --> 14:17.958
They didn't
make their burden.

14:17.991 --> 14:20.961
Maybe we don't even get up.

14:20.994 --> 14:23.630
Have you ever
heard him close?

14:23.664 --> 14:24.965
Who?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.900
Your friend the midget.

14:26.933 --> 14:27.968
He doesn't scare me.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.435
Bobby, there's no evidence

14:29.469 --> 14:31.972
of anybody else
coming into that room.

14:32.005 --> 14:34.107
We have to explain
why he never billed her,

14:34.140 --> 14:35.976
why he kept her pictures.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.110
It does seem suspicious.

14:37.143 --> 14:38.311
Suspicious, yes,

14:38.344 --> 14:40.313
but you can't convict
on that.

14:40.346 --> 14:44.050
It's too risky
not to have him testify.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.520
I'm not frightened.
I have nothing to hide.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.321
Can I do
the computer now?

14:48.354 --> 14:49.590
Ask your mother.

14:49.623 --> 14:50.924
Mom?

14:50.957 --> 14:52.993
You have another bite
of broccoli.

14:53.026 --> 14:53.994
Mom...

14:54.027 --> 14:56.062
The main thing,

14:56.096 --> 14:57.564
don't try to outsmart
this lawyer.

14:57.598 --> 14:59.265
He'll be trying
to trap you.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.067
Why aren't we calling
the sister?

15:01.101 --> 15:02.603
She's not in the mood
to help.

15:02.636 --> 15:04.070
You could subpoena her,
right?

15:04.104 --> 15:05.939
If she's not going
to be helpful --

15:05.972 --> 15:09.009
What about the ex-husband?
Can you call him to the stand?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.077
[ singsong ]
Steven, it's Nancy.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.079
Shut up, Laura.
Can I be excused?

15:13.113 --> 15:16.016
Yes, go ahead.

15:16.049 --> 15:19.085
I'm going to take it
in my room. One second.

15:19.119 --> 15:21.087
Anyway, the key
in your testimony

15:21.121 --> 15:23.089
is just stick
to yes or no.

15:23.123 --> 15:25.025
Okay.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.594
Why did you have
her pictures?

15:27.628 --> 15:30.564
I'm sure
he'll be asking that.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.298
That is something
they will ask.

15:32.332 --> 15:35.035
I didn't have an affair
with her, Allison.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.437
The police aren't
saying affair, Henry.

15:37.470 --> 15:41.174
They're saying that
you were obsessed with her.

15:41.207 --> 15:43.043
Are you?

15:43.076 --> 15:47.113
How many times are we going
to have the same talk?

15:47.147 --> 15:50.250
Every time something new
pops up -- like pictures.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.986
She gave me her pictures.
I don't know why.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.589
Maybe she's obsessed
with me.

15:55.622 --> 15:57.758
Look, think.
A woman who obsessively

15:57.791 --> 15:59.726
has to have
her teeth cleaned,

15:59.760 --> 16:02.729
maybe she sees
a dentist as --

16:02.763 --> 16:04.731
I don't know.
I don't know.

16:04.765 --> 16:07.200
Don't do that tomorrow.
Don't be playing hunches.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.536
Say, "she wanted me
to have them.

16:09.570 --> 16:11.071
I don't know why."

16:11.104 --> 16:13.507
And for some reason,
you didn't throw them out.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.209
What?

16:16.242 --> 16:18.344
Nothing.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.180
Oh, that's suspicious?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.649
What family doesn't
have grape jelly?

16:27.453 --> 16:29.155
Mr. Vogelman,

16:29.189 --> 16:31.758
I certainly sympathize
with the ongoing unfairness

16:31.792 --> 16:33.760
you have been subjected to.

16:33.794 --> 16:36.793
As your lawyer suspects I
know how you feel.

16:36.965 --> 16:41.101
 But the
co-op contract clearly
empowers the association.

16:41.101 --> 16:44.805
to evict a member as long
as it acts reasonably.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.808
Now, there is a great deal
of evidence here

16:47.841 --> 16:50.777
to suggest that you went
back to a motel

16:50.811 --> 16:53.279
with a young lady --
first date, no less --

16:53.313 --> 16:55.549
where you had sex with her,

16:55.582 --> 16:58.151
after which you promptly
chopped off her head.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.554
I wouldn't want you
on my block

17:00.587 --> 17:02.556
much less
in my apartment building.

17:02.589 --> 17:05.692
You may very well
be innocent,

17:05.726 --> 17:08.261
I realize that,

17:08.294 --> 17:10.262
but you might not be.

17:10.296 --> 17:14.535
Plaintiff's petition
for a T. R. O. Denied.

17:14.568 --> 17:16.169
Adjourned.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.405
What now?

17:19.439 --> 17:20.707
I don't know.

17:20.741 --> 17:22.175
Can I appeal?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.844
George,
my legal advice would be

17:23.877 --> 17:26.579
to start looking
for a new place to live.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.849
I never even got to have
my housewarming at this one.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.552
Well, maybe you can have
your goodbye party.

17:31.585 --> 17:32.853
Bad joke.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.188
Hey, have dinner with me,
Elleanor --

17:35.221 --> 17:37.190
my last supper.

17:37.223 --> 17:39.693
We can get an expensive
bottle of wine and,

17:39.726 --> 17:42.328
I don't know,
pretend things are good.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.064
I'm a good cook.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.570
Sure. It would be fun.

17:49.603 --> 17:51.337
Great.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.507
The question is,

17:53.540 --> 17:55.842
why didn't you
ever bill her,

17:55.876 --> 17:58.579
and why did you have
her pictures?

17:58.612 --> 18:00.581
'cause she gave me
her pictures,

18:00.614 --> 18:03.249
and I probably should
have thrown them away.

18:03.283 --> 18:07.387
As for the other,
I admit it was very nice

18:07.420 --> 18:09.723
to have a beautiful woman
come in.

18:09.756 --> 18:11.391
I don't get

18:11.424 --> 18:15.395
a lot of attention
from attractive...

18:15.428 --> 18:18.532
It was very flattering.

18:18.565 --> 18:21.401
Maybe I even
had a little crush,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.637
and so I didn't bill her,

18:23.670 --> 18:26.339
but I never had
an affair with her,

18:26.372 --> 18:28.875
and I certainly
did not kill her.

18:28.909 --> 18:30.611
Okay, Dr. Olson,

18:30.644 --> 18:33.146
I want you to take us
through that morning.

18:33.179 --> 18:34.781
I cleaned her teeth,

18:34.815 --> 18:36.883
and then I went back
to my office,

18:36.917 --> 18:39.419
which is at the end
of the corridor --

18:39.452 --> 18:40.554
40, maybe 50 feet --

18:40.587 --> 18:42.556
and I thought
she had left.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.826
I came out of my office
a little while later

18:45.859 --> 18:48.428
and I went
into the examining room

18:48.461 --> 18:49.563
just to clean up,

18:49.596 --> 18:54.500
and she was there
in the chair...

18:54.535 --> 18:56.637
Not breathing.

18:56.670 --> 18:58.572
What did you do then?

18:58.605 --> 19:00.507
I tried
to clear her airway,

19:00.541 --> 19:03.644
and I saw that her mouth
was filled with something.

19:03.677 --> 19:05.512
I didn't know what
at first,

19:05.546 --> 19:07.848
and then I realized
it was jelly.

19:07.881 --> 19:11.384
Then I tried to revive her,
and I couldn't,

19:11.417 --> 19:12.853
so I called 911.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.455
You tried to revive her?

19:15.488 --> 19:16.456
Yes.

19:16.489 --> 19:17.457
How?

19:17.490 --> 19:19.325
I did
some mouth-to-mouth.

19:19.359 --> 19:21.394
While she had a mouth
full of jelly?

19:21.427 --> 19:24.197
Well, I pulled enough out
to clear her airway.

19:24.230 --> 19:25.932
Why didn't you do
a tracheotomy?

19:25.966 --> 19:29.202
I considered that, but
the truth is, she was dead.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.272
She had no pulse,
she wasn't breathing.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.475
Okay, did you murder her
because she was going

19:35.509 --> 19:37.611
to break off
a sexual affair?

19:37.644 --> 19:38.745
Objection.

19:38.779 --> 19:40.547
You don't want him
to answer?

19:40.581 --> 19:43.483
I did not have an affair.
I did not kill her.

19:43.517 --> 19:45.752
Before you came back
to the examining room,

19:45.786 --> 19:48.354
you were
in your private office.

19:48.388 --> 19:49.489
Yes.

19:49.523 --> 19:51.291
Doing what?

19:51.324 --> 19:52.492
Uh, paperwork.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.695
I was going over
the day's appointments.

19:54.728 --> 19:55.962
Paperwork.

19:55.996 --> 19:57.964
Did you wash the floor?

19:57.998 --> 20:00.834
I'm sorry?

20:00.867 --> 20:02.368
The floor.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.506
The lab results showed traces
of ammonia and disinfectant
on the floor.

20:05.539 --> 20:06.773
Did you wash it?

20:06.807 --> 20:09.510
We have cleaners
that come in every night.

20:09.543 --> 20:11.512
They don't come in
on Sundays,

20:11.545 --> 20:12.779
and the analysis
showed this floor

20:12.813 --> 20:14.314
to be freshly washed.

20:14.347 --> 20:17.784
Some parts weren't even
completely dry.

20:17.818 --> 20:20.386
Did you wash the floor
that morning, Dr. Olson?

20:20.420 --> 20:22.322
No, I did not.

20:22.355 --> 20:25.258
Did you cause any liquid
to fall on the floor?

20:25.291 --> 20:27.528
Excuse me?

20:27.561 --> 20:28.328
Simple question --

20:28.361 --> 20:30.631
did you cause
any liquid to fall

20:30.664 --> 20:32.465
upon the floor
of your office?

20:32.498 --> 20:34.267
No, I don't believe I did.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.669
What about semen?

20:35.702 --> 20:38.404
Is there a reason
semen droplets were found,

20:38.438 --> 20:41.608
Droplets with an exact
DNA match to the ones --

20:41.642 --> 20:43.944
objection! There was no
evidence of semen introduced.

20:43.977 --> 20:46.947
Nor am I introducing it now.
I'm asking a question.

20:46.980 --> 20:48.481
If semen were found,

20:48.515 --> 20:50.817
any idea as to how
it could have gotten there?

20:50.851 --> 20:52.753
Did you think
you got it all

20:52.786 --> 20:55.288
when you washed the floor
that morning, Dr. Olson?

20:55.321 --> 20:57.691
Objection! Objection!

20:57.724 --> 21:01.695
I'll see counsel
in chambers.

21:01.728 --> 21:04.565
It's unfair surprise.
If they had evidence --

21:04.598 --> 21:06.700
we consider it neither
inculpatory nor exculpatory.

21:06.733 --> 21:08.569
It was a different room.

21:08.602 --> 21:09.636
Oh, you figured --

21:09.670 --> 21:10.837
All right!

21:10.871 --> 21:13.707
You have evidence
of the defendant's semen

21:13.740 --> 21:15.041
-being in his office?
-Yes.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.911
And you didn't
turn it over to them?

21:17.944 --> 21:20.046
We have no evidence
of the victim being

21:20.080 --> 21:21.648
in the defendant's office,

21:21.682 --> 21:23.617
therefore we don't
consider it relevant.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.451
So you Drop it
like a bomb --

21:25.485 --> 21:26.653
I asked a question.

21:26.687 --> 21:27.654
You tried to ambush
the witness!

21:27.688 --> 21:29.723
-MR. BAY: I did no such thing!
-JUDGE: Quiet!

21:29.756 --> 21:32.058
This should be declared
a mistrial right now!

21:32.092 --> 21:34.695
I said quiet.

21:37.698 --> 21:39.666
Mr. Bay,
I am very tempted

21:39.700 --> 21:41.935
to throw this trial out
right now.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.804
Your honor --

21:43.837 --> 21:45.939
Shut up. You're to
turn over to them

21:45.972 --> 21:47.608
everything you have
on this immediately.

21:47.641 --> 21:49.943
If there's
one more surprise,

21:49.976 --> 21:51.812
I will dismiss
with prejudice

21:51.845 --> 21:53.079
in favor
of the defendant.

21:53.113 --> 21:54.681
Do you understand me?

21:54.715 --> 21:55.749
Yes, your honor.

21:55.782 --> 21:58.351
I will also
put you in jail.

21:58.384 --> 22:00.353
If I could explain,
your honor --

22:00.386 --> 22:01.688
I'm not interested.

22:01.722 --> 22:04.758
You're on probation
for the rest of this trial.

22:04.791 --> 22:07.360
Your honor,
it's inconceivable

22:07.393 --> 22:10.430
for you not to declare
a mistrial now.

22:10.463 --> 22:12.899
That's not going to happen.
The trial goes on.

22:12.933 --> 22:16.036
You want to beat him up
in the parking lot,

22:16.069 --> 22:17.771
you have my blessing,

22:17.804 --> 22:19.873
but the trial goes on.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.386
What the hell was that?

22:33.419 --> 22:34.521
Oh, I can explain.

22:34.555 --> 22:35.689
It maybe too late!

22:35.722 --> 22:37.924
-Well, then I won't!
-Yes you will!

22:37.958 --> 22:39.993
-Bobby.
-You're going down for murder.
You get that?

22:40.026 --> 22:43.463
I didn't kill her.
You get that?
I didn't kill her.

22:43.496 --> 22:44.731
Then start talking.

22:44.765 --> 22:45.599
Leave him alone!

22:45.632 --> 22:48.602
Alright, everybody calm down,
okay?

22:48.635 --> 22:52.506
Henry, talk to me.

22:57.744 --> 23:01.582
-Allison, would you
take Steven out?
-What? Why?

23:01.615 --> 23:07.455
-Just do it, please.
-Okay. Come on, Steven.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.434
I have a fetish.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.038
A fetish?

23:25.071 --> 23:27.774
What kind of fetish?

23:30.043 --> 23:32.045
Bugs.

23:35.516 --> 23:37.083
Bugs?

23:37.117 --> 23:41.221
It's, um...

23:41.254 --> 23:45.659
I get aroused when I see
a woman step on them.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.163
She came in,

23:50.196 --> 23:52.498
I cleaned her teeth,

23:52.533 --> 23:56.503
and then she would
step on the bugs,

23:56.537 --> 23:59.973
and then I would go
to my office and, uh,

24:00.006 --> 24:01.842
you know, uh,

24:01.875 --> 24:04.611
gratify myself.

24:06.146 --> 24:11.117
And that's what happened
on that day.

24:11.151 --> 24:15.488
But then I came out,
and she was dead.

24:20.293 --> 24:23.196
I didn't kill her.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.765
I promise.

24:36.743 --> 24:37.711
I am not crazy.

24:37.744 --> 24:38.979
Elleanor, George is weird.

24:39.012 --> 24:40.947
He isn't weird.

24:40.981 --> 24:43.950
Even if he is, I feel bad
for the guy, okay?

24:43.984 --> 24:46.086
I mean, his life
is completely ruined.

24:46.119 --> 24:48.589
Doesn't mean
you have to eat pot roast.

24:48.622 --> 24:51.558
It's not like guys
are breaking down her door.

24:51.592 --> 24:53.093
-Lucy.
-I'm defending you.

24:53.126 --> 24:54.961
Rebecca,
get on the internet

24:54.995 --> 24:56.229
and find out
about crush clubs,

24:56.262 --> 24:57.864
people getting
sexually aroused

24:57.898 --> 24:59.666
by stepping on bugs.

24:59.700 --> 25:02.703
Then I need an expert witness
some shrink who can testify
about it. And I need it fast.

25:02.736 --> 25:04.004
What do you mean
stepping --

25:04.037 --> 25:05.005
Just what I said.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.006
What's going on?

25:06.039 --> 25:07.841
Our client likes bugs.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.843
Elleanor's dating
George Vogelman.

25:09.876 --> 25:12.779
I am not dating him!

25:16.216 --> 25:17.551
Richard --

25:17.584 --> 25:19.986
Don't start with me,
Helen.

25:20.020 --> 25:23.256
I just came to say hi.

25:23.289 --> 25:26.192
You know, you're lucky
the judge didn't toss it.

25:26.226 --> 25:28.862
Hey, if he did,
I'd have been no worse off.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.865
I had to catch him
on the stand, Helen.

25:31.898 --> 25:33.133
You know those guys.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.067
If I would have turned over
all that evidence,

25:34.100 --> 25:36.637
they'd have tailored
a nice little story

25:36.670 --> 25:38.171
to account
for the whole thing.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.707
I had to catch him
in a lie.

25:40.741 --> 25:42.976
Richard, It was prosecutorial
misconduct.

25:43.009 --> 25:45.311
Hey maybe you can live
with seeing murderers walk.

25:45.345 --> 25:46.713
I can't.

25:46.747 --> 25:48.915
No, you can live
with losing on appeal,

25:48.949 --> 25:50.116
so long as you win
at trial

25:50.150 --> 25:52.586
'cause that's when
the cameras are rolling.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.920
Thank you, Helen.

25:53.954 --> 25:56.256
You used to sleep
with one of their lawyers,

25:56.289 --> 26:00.326
you're living with another --
Hey maybe your even sleeping
with her.

26:00.360 --> 26:02.963
Does that make you
feel better saying that?

26:05.899 --> 26:08.702
This guy killed a woman.

26:08.735 --> 26:11.938
I'll do whatever I have to.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.710
It's called a crush fetish.

26:16.743 --> 26:18.779
I wouldn't say
it's common,

26:18.812 --> 26:20.280
but it's certainly not
unique to Dr. Olson.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.883
Can you describe it
for the jury?

26:22.916 --> 26:25.118
Basically it stems from
childhood,

26:25.151 --> 26:27.788
and it's generally related
to the oedipus complex.

26:27.821 --> 26:29.255
Can we talk specifically?

26:29.289 --> 26:30.657
Yes.

26:30.691 --> 26:32.793
Specifically, as a toddler,

26:32.826 --> 26:35.796
Dr. Olson saw his mother
frightened by a bug,

26:35.829 --> 26:37.798
after which
she stepped on it.

26:37.831 --> 26:40.200
Seeing a surge
in his mother's adrenaline

26:40.233 --> 26:42.869
caused a similar
adrenal surge in Dr. Olson.

26:42.903 --> 26:45.338
This is a typical genesis.

26:45.371 --> 26:47.040
For whatever reason,

26:47.073 --> 26:50.010
this adrenal rush
becomes sexual

26:50.043 --> 26:52.012
as the boy grows older,

26:52.045 --> 26:54.748
to the point
where one becomes aroused

26:54.781 --> 26:57.083
by seeing a female
stomp on a bug.

26:57.117 --> 26:58.885
You've studied this?

26:58.919 --> 26:59.753
I'm familiar with it.

26:59.786 --> 27:02.222
Believe it or not,
there is currently

27:02.255 --> 27:04.758
an american journal
of the crush freaks.

27:04.791 --> 27:07.027
Seeing a woman
mash a bug on the floor

27:07.060 --> 27:09.029
can be sexually stimulating?

27:09.062 --> 27:11.765
There's an underground
videotape industry --

27:11.798 --> 27:12.899
Thank you.

27:12.933 --> 27:16.169
And that's what was
going on with him?

27:16.202 --> 27:17.804
Yes.

27:17.838 --> 27:19.973
I would clean her teeth,

27:20.006 --> 27:21.975
and she would step
on cockroaches.

27:22.008 --> 27:23.309
And how did you meet
Ms. Poole?

27:23.343 --> 27:24.878
The internet.

27:24.911 --> 27:27.280
She proposed, uh, that
she would do this for me

27:27.313 --> 27:31.117
in exchange
for free teeth cleanings.

27:31.151 --> 27:33.119
Did you ever tell
anybody else

27:33.153 --> 27:34.988
about your fetish
for bugs?

27:35.021 --> 27:38.992
I told my wife once
that it aroused me,

27:39.025 --> 27:41.061
but I never told her

27:41.094 --> 27:43.797
that Ms. Poole was stepping
on them for me.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.801
So Ms. Poole,
she would crush these bugs,

27:47.834 --> 27:49.069
you'd become aroused

27:49.102 --> 27:51.271
and run back
to your office and...

27:51.304 --> 27:53.306
Yes.

27:55.976 --> 27:58.411
Plea bargain?
You mean say I did it?

27:58.444 --> 28:00.814
We're not recommending it,
just saying it's an option.

28:00.847 --> 28:03.316
But why would you be
throwing it out there

28:03.349 --> 28:04.751
if you're not
recommending it?

28:04.785 --> 28:08.221
Doctor you did okay damage
control just now, but the damage
was done.

28:08.254 --> 28:09.756
Jimmy.

28:09.790 --> 28:11.925
We're up against it,
Henry.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.227
I'm not saying
I think you did it --

28:14.260 --> 28:16.196
I'll say it.

28:16.229 --> 28:19.199
I don't believe you
anymore, Henry.

28:19.232 --> 28:21.034
Allison...

28:21.067 --> 28:25.171
Listening to you up there.

28:25.205 --> 28:26.907
You're sick.

28:26.940 --> 28:29.776
-You're just
a very sick person.
-Honey.

28:29.810 --> 28:32.813
Our children are going
to have to read about this.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.950
Could you give us
a moment?

28:36.983 --> 28:39.720
Sure.

28:54.535 --> 28:56.503
I don't know where to go --

28:56.537 --> 29:00.106
hatch a theory
he was being framed or...
I don't know.

29:00.140 --> 29:01.842
We should have
been digging

29:01.875 --> 29:03.910
into who else wanted
that woman dead.

29:03.944 --> 29:05.445
-We did dig into that.
-JIMMY: Not enough we didn't.

29:05.478 --> 29:07.047
She's into stuff
that kinky,

29:07.080 --> 29:10.851
who knows what people
she was mixed up with?

29:10.884 --> 29:12.919
He gets an annuity.
You know about that?

29:12.953 --> 29:14.054
Olson?

29:14.087 --> 29:15.321
From his father,

29:15.355 --> 29:18.258
-an annual annuity
of $125,000.
-So?

29:18.291 --> 29:20.126
So?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.228
Anybody thought
about plan "B"?

29:22.262 --> 29:24.865
Plan "B"? Who?
The ex has an alibi.

29:24.898 --> 29:26.232
Henry's wife.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.267
What?

29:27.300 --> 29:30.270
She got an alibi?
Think about it.

29:30.303 --> 29:32.105
Maybe she found out about
her husband's secret.

29:32.138 --> 29:33.774
Maybe she wanted revenge.

29:33.807 --> 29:37.143
Problem is if she kills him,
there goes the annuity and
she loses a lot of money.

29:37.177 --> 29:39.279
Better to frame him,
get him stuck in jail.

29:39.312 --> 29:41.214
Come on.

29:41.247 --> 29:44.284
Look, she probably has keys to
his offices. Maybe know's
his routines? Sneaks in
kills the girl.

29:44.317 --> 29:46.052
First of all, the police
checked her out.

29:46.086 --> 29:47.854
And accepted her word
that she was home.

29:47.888 --> 29:48.989
Well I know Allison --

29:49.022 --> 29:50.991
you said you knew Henry,

29:51.024 --> 29:53.393
-and you didn't know he was
cheating with a cockroach.
-Funny.

29:53.426 --> 29:55.261
If she doesn't really
have an alibi,

29:55.295 --> 29:57.130
maybe we could
plan "B" her.

29:57.163 --> 29:59.600
Bobby, there's no way
this woman killed her.

29:59.633 --> 30:02.135
Whether it's true or not
doesn't matter.

30:02.168 --> 30:03.203
The point is
you could sell it.

30:03.236 --> 30:06.206
I mean, at least enough
to make reasonable doubt.

30:06.239 --> 30:08.441
I thought you were out
of that business, Eugene --

30:08.474 --> 30:10.310
falsely accusing people
of murder.

30:10.343 --> 30:12.478
Last time we did this,
we got sued.

30:12.513 --> 30:14.014
I'm just throwing it
out there.

30:14.047 --> 30:17.150
You said you got an innocent
man for murder.I didn't
think you'd be too fussy

30:17.183 --> 30:18.418
over how you
got him acquitted.

30:18.451 --> 30:19.485
What was her statement?

30:19.520 --> 30:21.487
Home alone,
kids were at school.

30:21.522 --> 30:23.156
The police did confirm

30:23.189 --> 30:25.425
that the car
never left the Driveway.

30:25.458 --> 30:26.960
People take buses.

30:26.993 --> 30:28.161
It's too desperate.

30:28.194 --> 30:30.163
We are desperate, Jimmy.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.432
Your buddy was last seen
with the victim, he lies
under oath

30:32.465 --> 30:35.902
we find out that he gets
off on crushed cockroaches
he's a sick wacko.

30:35.936 --> 30:38.572
You don't know what
you're talking about.

30:38.605 --> 30:40.440
Let's just concentrate --

30:40.473 --> 30:42.375
Hold on. Hold on.

30:42.408 --> 30:43.910
Assuming this is an option,

30:43.944 --> 30:46.580
we call her and ask
to treat her hostile?

30:46.613 --> 30:48.248
Is there another way?

30:48.281 --> 30:50.083
We've got to run it
by the client.

30:50.116 --> 30:52.619
-And he'd say no.
-Which is maybe why we don't
tell him.

30:52.653 --> 30:56.957
-He'll tip her off...
-You can't not tell the client.
Bobby what are you crazy.

30:56.990 --> 31:00.160
Hey! Do we have an obligation to
tell the client our strategy?

31:00.193 --> 31:01.962
No, we have an obligation

31:01.995 --> 31:03.897
to act in his
best interest --

31:03.930 --> 31:06.099
You can't withhold
information from the client.
That's malpractice.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.101
It's not withholding
information.

31:08.134 --> 31:10.170
You plan to accuse
his wife of murder.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.572
That's not withholding
information?

31:11.605 --> 31:13.974
We've already been sued
for this.

31:14.007 --> 31:16.309
We don't need this kind
of publicity.

31:16.342 --> 31:17.644
All right, look,

31:17.678 --> 31:21.882
let's run it by Henry,
let it be his call.

31:26.219 --> 31:28.922
You never told me
you could cook.

31:28.955 --> 31:30.190
This is delicious.

31:30.223 --> 31:33.326
Two secrets --
first, butter.

31:33.359 --> 31:34.327
Butter?

31:34.360 --> 31:37.130
I smear the whole bird.
It seeps in when I bake.

31:37.163 --> 31:39.933
Second,
don't carve all at once.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.935
It just Dries out the meat.

31:41.968 --> 31:45.338
I carve as I serve.

31:45.371 --> 31:46.607
You want another piece?

31:46.640 --> 31:50.476
I will have one more,
and then I am done.

31:50.511 --> 31:53.413
That is an awfully big knife
you have there, George.

31:53.446 --> 31:57.350
All the better to cut
your head off with, my dear.

31:57.383 --> 31:58.484
Bad joke.

31:58.519 --> 32:00.486
That's one for each of us.

32:00.521 --> 32:03.156
Gallows humor
is all I have left.

32:03.189 --> 32:05.959
You know, this thing
is going to follow you.

32:05.992 --> 32:07.961
People are going
to make judgments.

32:07.994 --> 32:11.231
Sometimes you can fight it,
sometimes you can't.

32:11.264 --> 32:14.367
Maybe I should just sever
the past completely

32:14.400 --> 32:16.036
and leave town.

32:16.069 --> 32:18.038
That's not the worst idea,

32:18.071 --> 32:20.941
but I'd miss you.

32:27.347 --> 32:30.350
I'll miss you, too,
Elleanor.

32:35.355 --> 32:38.324
What's the matter?

32:38.358 --> 32:40.260
I've been missing you.

32:40.293 --> 32:42.996
One good thing
about my legal woes

32:43.029 --> 32:45.265
is I've been able
to spend time with you.

32:45.298 --> 32:48.268
Remember when we used to talk
on the phone and laugh

32:48.301 --> 32:51.337
back in the days,
before you laid eyes on me?

32:51.371 --> 32:54.407
George...

32:54.440 --> 32:58.344
You're the greatest woman
I've ever known, Elleanor.
I admit it.

33:02.148 --> 33:03.684
Thank you.

33:05.185 --> 33:08.454
This is where you're
suppose to say something
nice about me.

33:09.790 --> 33:13.760
Okay, how about...

33:13.794 --> 33:17.430
I really like having you
as a friend, George.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.567
Translation --

33:20.601 --> 33:23.570
let's just stay friends.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.628
-No.
-Henry.

33:47.661 --> 33:50.430
I'm not going to let you
point the finger at her.

33:50.463 --> 33:51.565
We could lose here.
You get that?

33:51.598 --> 33:55.168
You think I win because
I accuse my own wife of murder?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.402
We'd be doing it.

33:56.436 --> 33:58.438
With my blessing.

33:58.471 --> 34:01.441
You want to risk prison
the rest of your life?
Is that what I'm hearing?

34:01.474 --> 34:04.678
Allison could not possibly
have done this.
You know her.

34:04.711 --> 34:05.746
It doesn't matter.

34:05.779 --> 34:09.449
She's a red herring
to give us reasonable doubt.

34:09.482 --> 34:10.717
This is crazy, Jimmy.

34:10.751 --> 34:13.253
What jury is going
to believe --

34:13.286 --> 34:15.789
it isn't crazy.
Think about it.

34:15.822 --> 34:18.190
Don't get me wrong.

34:18.224 --> 34:20.527
I'm not saying
I think she did it,

34:20.561 --> 34:22.529
but the idea she did --

34:22.563 --> 34:25.532
you said yourself you two
had a big screaming fight

34:25.565 --> 34:28.268
over this bug fetish thing.

34:28.301 --> 34:30.804
Maybe she figured
it was going on at work.

34:30.837 --> 34:33.806
If the door was locked,
she'd have a key, right?

34:33.840 --> 34:36.543
You kept your appointments
in your computer at home.

34:36.577 --> 34:38.812
She'd know if anybody
would be there.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.481
She knew your office hours
of business.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.150
Can you be positive
she didn't go down there?

34:44.184 --> 34:46.652
Yes, I can.

34:55.195 --> 35:00.915
Me and you...
Lawyer privilege?
Friend privilege?

35:03.504 --> 35:05.238
Me and you?

35:06.707 --> 35:08.642
Sure.

35:09.275 --> 35:14.781
You were close.
It was Steven.

35:16.216 --> 35:19.520
What?

35:19.553 --> 35:21.454
Your son Steven?

35:21.487 --> 35:24.525
I saw the door close
on him when he left.

35:24.558 --> 35:27.393
I think he must have
come down,

35:27.427 --> 35:28.529
maybe discovered --

35:28.562 --> 35:29.796
Why haven't you told
anybody this?

35:29.830 --> 35:32.799
Because I don't want him
to spend the rest of
his life in jail

35:32.833 --> 35:35.536
for something
I drove him to.

35:35.569 --> 35:37.904
Now look you said I had
a very good chance

35:37.938 --> 35:39.506
of beating this thing.

35:39.540 --> 35:41.508
That's what
I've decided to do.

35:41.542 --> 35:43.276
He's letting you
take the fall?

35:43.309 --> 35:45.546
Oh, he's so angry with me,
he doesn't care.

35:45.579 --> 35:47.681
He doesn't even know
I know.

35:51.718 --> 35:53.820
Let me go to the D. A.

35:53.854 --> 35:55.956
Absolutely not!
No chance!

35:55.989 --> 35:58.525
They will try him
as an adult.

35:58.559 --> 36:00.827
You know that, Jimmy.
His life will be over.

36:00.861 --> 36:01.795
What if he kills --

36:01.828 --> 36:03.697
-Well I'll get him help.
-No Henry you can't.

36:03.730 --> 36:06.833
This is between you and me.
You gave me your word.

36:06.867 --> 36:10.403
You say anything to anybody,

36:10.436 --> 36:12.438
I'll confess to the crime.

36:15.308 --> 36:19.412
This happened because of me,

36:19.445 --> 36:22.749
and I'm willing
to take the risk.

36:34.628 --> 36:38.632
Okay. Closing arguments.

36:42.636 --> 36:44.871
Does it look bad?

36:44.905 --> 36:46.607
Of course it does.

36:46.640 --> 36:48.875
She was strangled
in his dental chair --

36:48.909 --> 36:52.746
no prints belonging
to anybody else.

36:52.779 --> 36:54.748
We know
he's a little twisted --

36:54.781 --> 36:58.585
sexually aroused
by seeing bugs get crushed?

36:58.619 --> 36:59.986
What's with that?

37:00.020 --> 37:03.624
It looks really bad,

37:03.657 --> 37:07.493
but he didn't do it.

37:07.528 --> 37:10.631
Who did?

37:10.664 --> 37:12.332
I don't know.

37:12.365 --> 37:14.635
I do know the victim
put herself out there

37:14.668 --> 37:17.604
on the internet
advertising her services,

37:17.638 --> 37:19.906
and you encounter a lot
of depraved people

37:19.940 --> 37:21.908
doing that kind of thing.

37:21.942 --> 37:24.477
Maybe she was stalked
that day.

37:24.511 --> 37:26.747
Maybe she was followed
to my client's office.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.482
Maybe her routine
was known to the killer

37:29.516 --> 37:32.919
and this presented
the perfect opportunity.

37:32.953 --> 37:34.655
I don't know.

37:34.688 --> 37:36.022
Neither do they.

37:36.056 --> 37:39.660
All they can prove
with the physical evidence

37:39.693 --> 37:43.764
is that my client was
in the same room as the victim.

37:43.797 --> 37:45.532
Well, he admitted that.

37:45.566 --> 37:47.768
In fact, he called the police,
didn't he?

37:47.801 --> 37:48.935
And think about this.

37:48.969 --> 37:50.937
If he was going
to kill somebody,

37:50.971 --> 37:52.673
would he do it this way --

37:52.706 --> 37:55.676
strangle the person
in his own office,

37:55.709 --> 37:57.811
put grape jelly
in her mouth,

37:57.844 --> 38:00.814
leave his gloves
in the room?

38:00.847 --> 38:03.550
Wouldn't he try
to get away with it?

38:03.584 --> 38:07.053
Why didn't he?
Because he didn't do it.

38:07.087 --> 38:09.690
And they have no physical
or testimonial evidence

38:09.723 --> 38:13.293
to prove that he did.

38:17.698 --> 38:21.802
He kept her pictures,
cleaned her teeth for free

38:21.835 --> 38:24.705
while she squished
cockroaches.

38:24.738 --> 38:27.708
Maybe she said she wasn't
going to do it anymore

38:27.741 --> 38:29.843
and he snapped.

38:29.876 --> 38:33.847
We could stand here all day
trying to make sense of it,

38:33.880 --> 38:37.083
but you can't make sense
of depravities,

38:37.117 --> 38:38.719
ladies and gentlemen,

38:38.752 --> 38:42.589
whether it be a murder
or a bug fetish.

38:42.623 --> 38:46.560
It's pointless
to apply reason.

38:46.593 --> 38:48.829
No evidence points
to anybody else

38:48.862 --> 38:51.865
being in that room
other than the defendant.

38:51.898 --> 38:54.134
The woman he engages
to come to his office

38:54.167 --> 38:58.572
to squish insects
and bring him to a climax

38:58.605 --> 39:00.440
is found dead.

39:00.473 --> 39:05.612
Him and her,
she ends up strangled.

39:05.646 --> 39:07.614
We caught him in a lie

39:07.648 --> 39:10.116
right here
on the witness stand.

39:10.150 --> 39:13.754
We already know he's a liar.

39:13.787 --> 39:16.456
Is there really
even a question here

39:16.489 --> 39:20.360
that he's also a murderer?

39:24.765 --> 39:26.099
Elleanor.

39:26.132 --> 39:27.734
Hey, George.

39:27.768 --> 39:28.735
Come on in.

39:28.769 --> 39:30.837
Actually, I'm running late
for a deposition.

39:30.871 --> 39:32.839
I just stopped by to...

39:32.873 --> 39:36.643
Well, I'm just feeling
a little uncomfortable

39:36.677 --> 39:38.645
about last night's kiss.

39:38.679 --> 39:40.113
Oh?

39:40.146 --> 39:42.916
I've been thinking
about it all night,

39:42.949 --> 39:44.450
and you know, George,

39:44.484 --> 39:46.853
your trial was the biggest
professional victory

39:46.887 --> 39:48.188
of my life.

39:48.221 --> 39:50.657
It was pretty big
for me, too.

39:50.691 --> 39:52.659
But I mean I think,
on some level,

39:52.693 --> 39:55.662
I try to relive that victory
every chance I get,

39:55.696 --> 39:59.065
and being in your company,
on some unconscious --

39:59.099 --> 40:02.736
I just think I feel
better about myself

40:02.769 --> 40:04.605
when I'm with you.

40:04.638 --> 40:06.673
You kissed me on some
professional high?

40:06.707 --> 40:11.077
No, no, it's not that.

40:11.111 --> 40:16.082
I like being with you
because...

40:16.116 --> 40:18.084
What I came here to say

40:18.118 --> 40:21.955
is that our friendship
is very complicated,

40:21.988 --> 40:24.691
and my kissing you

40:24.725 --> 40:27.828
is probably not going
to happen again,

40:27.861 --> 40:30.764
and I just want
to be clear on that,

40:30.797 --> 40:33.166
that we just keep it
as friends.

40:33.199 --> 40:36.036
Okay.

40:36.069 --> 40:37.704
I understand.

40:37.738 --> 40:39.239
Do you?

40:39.272 --> 40:41.575
I get it, Elleanor.

40:41.608 --> 40:44.044
You okay with that?

40:44.077 --> 40:47.113
Yes.

40:47.147 --> 40:50.116
I appreciate your
coming here to tell me.

40:50.150 --> 40:54.054
Well, good.

40:54.087 --> 40:55.922
See you soon?

40:55.956 --> 40:58.191
Absolutely.

40:58.224 --> 41:02.863
Well, I got
that deposition, so...

41:02.896 --> 41:05.532
All right.

41:05.566 --> 41:06.867
Bye.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.902
Bye.

41:20.313 --> 41:21.948
You're worried
about your son.

41:21.982 --> 41:23.950
How's he going
to be better off --

41:23.984 --> 41:25.719
He'll be better off
out of prison.

41:25.752 --> 41:28.121
Listen to me Henry, once that
verdict comes back,

41:28.154 --> 41:29.856
we have no credibility.

41:29.890 --> 41:32.225
You're just a guilty man
trying some desperate act --

41:32.258 --> 41:34.961
unless it comes back
not guilty.

41:34.995 --> 41:36.697
You yourself said
we have a decent chance.

41:36.730 --> 41:37.698
But it's a risk.

41:37.731 --> 41:39.232
A risk I'm willing to take.

41:39.265 --> 41:40.100
Henry --

41:40.133 --> 41:43.003
I've made my decision.

41:45.271 --> 41:47.273
Jury's back.

42:12.899 --> 42:16.770
Will the defendant
