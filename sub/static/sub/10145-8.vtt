00:01.453 --> 00:03.463
Mafia boss Arkady Ulyanov.

00:03.494 --> 00:05.911
Everyone from the Governor
down is on his payroll.

00:05.934 --> 00:07.655
Ulyanov is working with Al-Zuhari.

00:07.660 --> 00:10.177
Ulyanov finds out we're in his prison,
we're dead men walking.

00:10.189 --> 00:12.355
What happened at the bank? Leo?

00:13.067 --> 00:15.835
Al-Zuhari ordered me
to close all of his accounts.

00:15.840 --> 00:17.465
Michael's test
results came through.

00:17.470 --> 00:20.332
He's been exposed to a neurotoxin.
He will deteriorate rapidly.

00:20.355 --> 00:21.982
How are things going, doctor?

00:22.029 --> 00:24.883
When Andersson is done,
you will see he is transferred.

00:24.915 --> 00:26.457
Let's get you out of here.

00:27.245 --> 00:30.108
- I am Major Nina Pirogova
- You're Locke's inside man?

00:30.112 --> 00:31.745
My job is to get you out of here.

00:31.750 --> 00:34.916
Your plan could use
a little more finesse.

01:29.374 --> 01:31.844
Stay away! Stay away!

01:33.879 --> 01:35.964
How did this man get away?

01:36.352 --> 01:39.217
During processing.
A mistake.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.295
- He's not contaminated.
- No risks.

01:42.993 --> 01:45.162
Prepare it for incineration!

02:01.603 --> 02:03.488
Get me back to the facility.

02:15.595 --> 02:17.207
Oh, shit.

STRIKE BACK 4x08

03:41.430 --> 03:44.803
BLACK BEAR PRISON, MOSCOW

04:03.806 --> 04:07.198
- There is a mistake!
I am FSB. - I know.

04:07.828 --> 04:14.055
- Where is Iljin? - As dead ad the stinking
corpse in the boot of your car.

04:14.426 --> 04:16.563
He stank before
I put him there.

04:20.190 --> 04:21.930
Corrupt pig!

04:23.424 --> 04:26.323
You want me to have a shot?
'Cause your people skills suck.

04:27.849 --> 04:29.852
So my friend got away, huh?

04:30.361 --> 04:32.962
Pretty soon he's gonna come back
and then we're gonna get out of here.

04:35.469 --> 04:39.066
The same friend we found
in one of our trucks?

04:39.975 --> 04:43.344
Sergeant Damien Scott,
you have a death wish?

04:43.977 --> 04:46.043
First you kill my boss' son,

04:46.163 --> 04:49.823
then you team up with
Colonel Pirogov's daughter.

04:53.005 --> 04:54.411
Let's go!

04:55.708 --> 04:58.078
"Want me to give it a shot", huh?

05:00.672 --> 05:03.259
You don't want to do that.
We really don't get along.

05:03.955 --> 05:06.342
The American thinks he's funny.

05:06.353 --> 05:09.722
- What'd you say?
- That you only have one testicle.

05:09.754 --> 05:11.657
It's all for you.

05:12.758 --> 05:14.793
Colonel, you assured us

05:14.826 --> 05:17.198
your men could prevent
Andersson breaching the hub.

05:17.201 --> 05:21.135
- My men are still in the field.
This mission is... - They failed!

05:22.672 --> 05:25.209
We have intel that
prisoners are being moved

05:25.242 --> 05:27.705
from Black Bear on
behalf of Al-Zuhari.

05:27.746 --> 05:30.611
- Where to? And what for?
- Well, we don't know yet.

05:30.624 --> 05:32.388
We have no sat cover, ma'am.

05:32.389 --> 05:34.869
NATO has drones on Poland's
eastern border and I need them.

05:34.872 --> 05:36.682
Over Russian air space?

05:36.723 --> 05:39.852
Well, with respect, I'm not in the business
of making friends.

05:39.865 --> 05:43.061
I'm just trying to prevent
an attack that we know is coming!

05:43.094 --> 05:45.165
Until you have more
detailed information...

05:45.198 --> 05:47.997
Well, without drones,
I can't get it, sir!

05:48.030 --> 05:50.165
Where are your men now, Colonel?

05:50.308 --> 05:53.635
Well, the last we heard, they were
on their way out of Black Bear.

05:53.912 --> 05:58.175
As soon as I have more detailed
intel, you'll be fully briefed.

05:58.216 --> 06:01.214
- You'll get your drones, Colonel.
- Sir, ma'am.

06:05.584 --> 06:07.590
So you got history
with these assholes?

06:07.623 --> 06:11.491
History? Arkady Ulyanov
murdered my father.

06:11.524 --> 06:13.185
Fuck me.

06:13.218 --> 06:16.127
- This is gonna end well.
- I guarantee it.

07:02.653 --> 07:04.486
Seal the room.

07:10.360 --> 07:14.130
Please. No.
No!

07:36.028 --> 07:38.068
Use Vector Strain.

07:39.201 --> 07:42.301
He's running a fever. Looks like
there are respiratory problems.

07:43.510 --> 07:45.512
Ah, dispose of him.

07:57.008 --> 08:00.516
- We need gas.
- Pull in here.

08:15.544 --> 08:19.462
- Leave the fucking phone!
- Alright.

08:34.037 --> 08:36.466
You think he's gonna
buy us a bag of chips?

08:36.499 --> 08:38.337
Don't be smart-ass.

08:40.403 --> 08:42.876
You gonna ask him for me?
I like the barbecue ones.

08:42.909 --> 08:46.414
You want bullet?
Keep talking.

08:46.447 --> 08:49.958
How's that gonna go down with Ulyanov?
Wants me for himself, doesn't he?

08:50.478 --> 08:52.181
Break his fingers!

08:53.014 --> 08:55.082
What did Fuckoffski say?

08:57.785 --> 08:59.550
Oh, you gonna break that?

09:00.422 --> 09:02.250
Fuck! What is this?

09:07.393 --> 09:09.406
- Bring the phone!
- I'm trying!

09:14.408 --> 09:16.601
What are you saying?
Say it in English.

09:16.634 --> 09:18.489
- Fucking asshole.
- Yeah, he is.

09:18.492 --> 09:20.871
Get out, get out. Oh, wait!

09:22.471 --> 09:24.537
- Come on.
- I'm coming!

09:25.070 --> 09:26.605
Coming.

09:26.638 --> 09:28.867
- I'm gonna go after
that car, all right? - Yeah.

09:28.869 --> 09:30.883
- Ready to run? Coming?
- Yeah.

09:31.809 --> 09:32.872
Down.

09:32.905 --> 09:34.575
Coming? Go!

09:37.742 --> 09:39.476
Down, down, down, down.
OK. Get in the car.

09:39.509 --> 09:42.743
Get in.
Move over 'cause I'm driving.

09:42.776 --> 09:46.245
Well, get in the car, then.
Get in!

09:48.982 --> 09:51.442
Motherfucker!

09:56.184 --> 09:58.150
Shoot! Shoot!

09:59.486 --> 10:02.320
- Nice!
- Just shut up and drive.

11:04.435 --> 11:06.173
You have the men?

11:06.804 --> 11:08.711
One is at Drezna.

11:09.768 --> 11:11.483
The other one got away.

11:12.403 --> 11:13.952
Idiot!

11:26.338 --> 11:27.938
I've fucked up.

11:28.469 --> 11:30.108
I fucked up.

11:35.845 --> 11:37.216
Where have you been?

11:37.225 --> 11:40.947
I had to give Ulyanov your men.
I've told him they were at Black Bear.

11:41.020 --> 11:43.249
- What?
- Philip, he didn't trust me.

11:43.282 --> 11:46.952
I was in a corner.
I had to give him something real.

11:48.456 --> 11:51.022
You used Michael and Damien.

11:51.087 --> 11:54.153
I used what I had,
as you use me.

11:54.164 --> 11:56.389
Right. Well, tell me what you know.

11:56.430 --> 12:00.767
Where are they taking the prisoners?
- He has a facility north of Black Bear.

12:00.900 --> 12:02.784
Give me the location.
How far north?

12:02.787 --> 12:06.002
- I don't know.
- Well, what kind of facility?

12:06.105 --> 12:08.105
- It's bio-chemical.
- Yeah, and what do they...

12:08.146 --> 12:10.315
That's all I know!

12:10.347 --> 12:13.822
Philip,
I couldn't press him any harder.

12:14.255 --> 12:16.332
- I'm sorry.
- You're sorry?

12:17.465 --> 12:19.290
You get back here now.

12:33.446 --> 12:36.314
What are you gonna do with that?
Oh, fuck.

12:36.647 --> 12:38.051
Shit!

12:39.484 --> 12:41.400
You always run out at
the worst possible time.

12:41.453 --> 12:42.856
No kidding.

12:42.889 --> 12:45.652
- Well, it looks like
you're stuck with me. - Great.

12:47.295 --> 12:49.727
Do me a favor.
Get 20 on that phone.

12:51.066 --> 12:53.171
Why did Ulyanov kill your dad?

12:54.142 --> 12:56.678
Because he was an honest man.

12:58.547 --> 13:01.546
- There.
- Thank you.

13:06.062 --> 13:07.631
Martinez.

13:08.064 --> 13:09.870
I have Scott!

13:10.293 --> 13:11.866
On speaker.

13:12.399 --> 13:14.203
Go ahead, Sergeant.
What have you got for me?

13:14.236 --> 13:17.310
I'm with Pigarover.
Heh! Pirogova.

13:17.343 --> 13:21.278
- We're somewhere east of Black Bear.
- Stonebridge? - I lost him.

13:21.311 --> 13:24.278
They put Andersson on one of
those prison transport trucks.

13:24.719 --> 13:27.154
Mikey went after him.
I couldn't stop him.

13:27.187 --> 13:30.506
Well, we have eyes in the sky.
Any idea where we should be looking?

13:30.996 --> 13:33.462
Negative.
Mike's in a pretty bad way.

13:33.503 --> 13:36.739
I think it's in his chest.
He's having difficulty breathing.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.908
Then we haven't got long to find him.
Get back as soon as, Scott.

13:39.942 --> 13:42.999
- Shit! - Yeah, copy that. I got to
go. I got to lose some cops.

13:43.353 --> 13:44.784
Take that.

13:50.431 --> 13:53.271
- Have a lock on Scott's signal.
- Go.

14:08.690 --> 14:10.182
Come here.

14:12.123 --> 14:13.686
Sit down! Sit!

14:13.919 --> 14:16.294
What is this place?
Where the fuck are we?

14:17.927 --> 14:20.293
It's a research facility.
In Drezna.

14:20.326 --> 14:22.161
What kind of research?

14:22.994 --> 14:25.768
- I'm only an assistant.
I don't know! - Bullshit!

14:26.301 --> 14:28.136
It's biological.

14:30.775 --> 14:32.904
Weaponized smallpox.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.009
Shit.

14:40.700 --> 14:43.821
- Give me your phone.
- They're not permitted.

14:44.654 --> 14:46.784
Only Dr. Takenaka has a phone.

14:49.003 --> 14:51.662
Take me.
Take me to Andersson.

14:51.895 --> 14:54.701
He's the man I came in
with. Take me to him.

14:59.177 --> 15:00.911
You're dying.

15:03.180 --> 15:04.948
I could help.

15:05.561 --> 15:07.580
I could help you.

15:10.856 --> 15:13.127
Just take me to Andersson.
Now.

15:16.408 --> 15:18.688
- They're gaining.
- No shit.

15:18.723 --> 15:21.195
Anytime you want to
stop busting my balls...

15:21.230 --> 15:23.332
or ball, as you
put it... you can.

15:23.365 --> 15:25.868
I'll let you know
when I'm finished.

15:26.701 --> 15:30.642
- Do you feel threatened? - I've eaten
tougher steaks than you, sweetheart.

15:44.803 --> 15:46.694
That woman yesterday.

15:47.577 --> 15:50.892
- The hostage?
- Julia, it didn't bother you?

15:50.985 --> 15:53.266
Kim, this is not the DEA.

15:53.301 --> 15:56.370
It's not about the law.
Things aren't black and white.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.908
I understand gray. I do.

15:59.001 --> 16:02.115
What? I've served undercover.
Did some questionable things.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.967
Now, I can live with
killing that guard

16:04.002 --> 16:06.863
and hearing his girl on the phone,
but I have never stood by

16:06.887 --> 16:10.124
and watched an innocent woman
executed like that before.

16:12.695 --> 16:15.627
Is this where you tell me we
live in a complicated world?

16:15.660 --> 16:17.661
Or a very simple one.

16:19.802 --> 16:23.426
- It gets easier.
- Yeah.

16:32.216 --> 16:35.989
- Lost signal.
- So? Which way now?

16:39.308 --> 16:41.765
That car is from Black Bear.

16:52.035 --> 16:54.103
- Where are you going?
- I have no idea.

16:58.040 --> 17:01.005
- We're almost out of fuel.
- Shit.

17:01.040 --> 17:03.667
You couldn't have picked a car
with a full tank, could you?

17:03.702 --> 17:07.247
Yeah, sorry, I should have filled up with gas
and checked the oil before I stole it.

17:07.277 --> 17:11.518
- Ooh, sarcasm from an American.
- What, you think we don't get it?

17:11.553 --> 17:14.190
Oh, come on. Everybody knows this.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.549
You want to do stereotypes?

17:19.550 --> 17:22.095
You might look good now,
sweetheart, but everybody knows

17:22.127 --> 17:24.720
all Russian women turn into
short, fat little grannies

17:24.732 --> 17:26.963
who wear head scarves
and have mustaches.

17:27.306 --> 17:29.598
I can see one starting now.

17:32.570 --> 17:34.134
Babushka.

17:34.467 --> 17:36.405
- What?
- That's how we call them.

17:36.412 --> 17:39.467
See? You even got a name
for them. Must be true.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.810
- Why are you going up there?
- You see any other fuckin' road around here?

17:53.942 --> 17:55.149
Fuck!

17:57.149 --> 17:59.148
Come here. Come here. Come on.

18:01.749 --> 18:03.142
Whoa! Come here.

18:03.145 --> 18:04.832
- Hurry! What?
- One second.

18:04.835 --> 18:06.587
- Come on!
- Quick, quick.

18:39.153 --> 18:43.248
All right. They take the bait.
That's an outstanding explosion.

18:46.565 --> 18:49.066
- More cops?
- Those aren't cops.

18:59.489 --> 19:01.443
Cops. Black Bear guards.

19:01.476 --> 19:04.286
Ulyanov. Is there anyone you
haven't pissed off yet?

19:04.319 --> 19:06.793
Just as long as you still love me.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.526
Where are you going?

19:18.855 --> 19:20.217
Who is that?

19:20.230 --> 19:23.173
Nice timing.
That's friends of mine.

19:31.177 --> 19:33.451
- We're gonna walk out there, all right?
- Are you?

19:33.461 --> 19:34.914
- Trust me.
- What?

19:34.957 --> 19:37.851
Just trust me. You want
to die stuck here, hmm?

19:37.984 --> 19:40.493
- You tell me.
- You don't.

19:42.609 --> 19:45.350
Do what I do. Walk.

19:52.144 --> 19:53.736
Eyes on Scott.

19:56.059 --> 19:57.805
Fellas?

19:57.938 --> 20:00.277
Unarmed. No gun.

20:21.705 --> 20:24.126
Put your gun down.
Put it down.

20:24.269 --> 20:25.835
Right there. Down.

20:25.870 --> 20:29.295
- Down on your knees. You got him?
- Yeah.

20:29.908 --> 20:33.000
- Nice work, Babushka.
- Don't get overexcited.

20:34.391 --> 20:37.305
I saw you take his money.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.765
Scum!

20:40.768 --> 20:44.169
Major Pirogova.
He give you any trouble?

20:44.430 --> 20:45.955
- Who?
- Ah, she loves me.

20:45.975 --> 20:48.671
- Clearly.
- Nice of you guys to show up.

20:48.706 --> 20:51.145
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

20:51.778 --> 20:54.153
- Shall we go find Michael?
- Let's do it.

21:03.649 --> 21:05.727
What have you done to me?

21:17.249 --> 21:20.377
- Where have you been?
- Watch out! - Come here.

21:20.510 --> 21:23.691
You miss me? Don't! Don't you run,
or I'll slit his throat.

21:24.802 --> 21:26.984
Give me your phone.

21:27.017 --> 21:29.046
Put it in my left hand.
Yeah.

21:30.986 --> 21:33.685
He won't do it.
He needs me alive.

21:33.718 --> 21:36.887
- Go! Go!
- Don't do that! Don't do that!

21:36.922 --> 21:39.092
You have to get me
out of here!

21:39.265 --> 21:43.106
You can't.
He's infected, contagious.

21:43.128 --> 21:45.366
There must be something
you can do!

21:45.899 --> 21:48.403
He'll be dead in hours.

21:51.702 --> 21:55.218
- That's smallpox, right?
- A variant.

21:55.253 --> 21:58.735
- Much, much more effective.
- Huh? Effective?

21:58.942 --> 22:02.014
If Al-Zuhari gets his hands on this,
thousands of people will die.

22:02.049 --> 22:05.789
- Tens of thousands.
- But why?

22:06.744 --> 22:10.218
- You're not even a believer.
What is it, money? - Science.

22:10.253 --> 22:11.931
Come here. Come here.

22:13.551 --> 22:15.228
Erik, I need you
to listen to me.

22:15.235 --> 22:18.437
I need you to tell me everything
you know about their plans.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.176
You're going to leave
me here, aren't you?

22:20.180 --> 22:21.974
You heard what he said.

22:22.009 --> 22:25.214
I can't let you out,
but I will get you some help.

22:25.249 --> 22:28.420
Anything that I can do,
I will do, but right now,

22:28.423 --> 22:32.292
you have to tell me everything
that you know about them.

22:32.305 --> 22:33.904
Do you understand me?

22:34.654 --> 22:38.635
Yeah. I downloaded details
of every NATO base in Europe:

22:38.645 --> 22:40.749
schedules, personnel files,

22:40.768 --> 22:43.005
manifests, maps.

22:43.105 --> 22:46.168
Was there any indication on
where they plan the attacks?

22:46.601 --> 22:50.172
No. But I wasn't just downloading.

22:50.492 --> 22:54.077
- I was uploading onto the servers, too.
- What were you uploading?

22:54.310 --> 22:57.541
Clean skins. Their
people into the system.

22:58.573 --> 23:00.584
Guards! Guards!

23:02.017 --> 23:05.621
Go.
I tagged them.

23:05.654 --> 23:09.422
- Everything I did, I tagged.
- Thank you.

23:11.758 --> 23:13.995
Everything I did, I tagged.

23:46.690 --> 23:48.300
Yes, Philip,

23:48.540 --> 23:52.350
giving up Scott and Stonebridge
was a pressure decision.

23:52.980 --> 23:57.755
But in that moment, I thought it was
a risk worth taking.

23:58.030 --> 24:01.375
I believe they can
look after themselves.

24:01.410 --> 24:03.940
You do the same every time
you send them out there.

24:04.460 --> 24:06.660
You tell me you wouldn't
have done what I did.

24:07.070 --> 24:11.525
Now at least we know the nature
of the attack Al-Zuhari is planning.

24:11.555 --> 24:15.157
- We know it's bio-chemical...
- How do I even know that's true?

24:17.480 --> 24:19.360
What happened in Beirut, Leo?

24:21.570 --> 24:26.020
Yeah, what happened in Rue Eville,
when Dalton went into that house?

24:26.030 --> 24:27.450
I was shot.

24:27.860 --> 24:29.450
In the shoulder.

24:30.120 --> 24:33.220
You think I engineered that?

24:33.940 --> 24:37.750
I could have died.
And for what? For this?

24:37.830 --> 24:40.780
You are treating me like
a fucking traitor again.

24:40.890 --> 24:43.000
But you didn't die,
though, did you?

24:44.030 --> 24:47.075
One of my people did,
just like Van Berg...

24:47.110 --> 24:49.220
Do you think I could
have stopped her?

24:49.710 --> 24:53.300
You couldn't control her.
For God's sake...

24:53.340 --> 24:54.940
And which God
would that be, Leo?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.470
Does that matter?

25:04.110 --> 25:05.860
I can't make you trust me.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.550
You stay there.

25:10.250 --> 25:12.270
- Major.
- Colonel.

25:12.790 --> 25:14.710
- You OK?
- Yeah.

25:15.140 --> 25:17.450
You got anything on where
they're taking the prisoners?

25:18.080 --> 25:20.715
9 possibles within a hundred
miles north of Black Bear.

25:20.750 --> 25:23.350
We've been using drones to
track traffic from the prison,

25:23.385 --> 25:25.710
but so far we've got nothing.

25:25.970 --> 25:27.800
How long has Michael got?

25:28.810 --> 25:31.030
- This is about stopping
Al-Zuhari... - How long?

25:31.160 --> 25:32.590
Not long.

25:34.320 --> 25:36.260
- Leo.
- Don't ask.

25:37.590 --> 25:41.245
- What the fuck is going on?
- Spetsnaz team is on standby.

25:41.275 --> 25:44.650
Unofficial. The commander
was a friend of my father.

25:44.685 --> 25:46.040
Thank you.

25:46.310 --> 25:47.780
Michael.

25:48.360 --> 25:50.340
Sergeant?

25:50.460 --> 25:54.100
- What's your sit-rep?
- I'm alive. Is Damien with you?

25:54.135 --> 25:56.200
Yeah, I'm here, bud. All good.

25:56.235 --> 25:57.950
Your location, Michael?

25:58.090 --> 26:02.680
Drezna. They're developing weaponized
smallpox for Al-Zuhari.

26:03.830 --> 26:07.220
The Black Bear prisoners
are the test subjects.

26:07.250 --> 26:08.790
Inform NATO.

26:08.795 --> 26:12.860
I have a lock on the signal,
and it's a match for Drezna.

26:13.400 --> 26:16.510
Boss, Andersson's been infected.

26:18.070 --> 26:21.310
But he's not just
decoding data.

26:21.570 --> 26:24.000
- He was uploading.
- Uploading what?

26:24.150 --> 26:25.700
Clean skins.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.170
He's been putting their
people into the system.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.650
Fake IDs,

26:31.150 --> 26:32.855
but he tagged them somehow.

26:32.890 --> 26:35.150
Michael, we have your
meds and we're on our way.

26:38.310 --> 26:39.760
Roger that.

26:44.990 --> 26:46.410
Michael?

26:59.290 --> 27:01.570
- Leo, look...
- Nothing to say.

27:01.590 --> 27:04.050
We're, all of us,
under massive pressure.

27:04.070 --> 27:09.105
Look, if this smallpox virus
is at the Drezna facility,

27:09.140 --> 27:11.860
then a frontal assault
could be dangerous,

27:11.895 --> 27:14.522
suicidal, even, if
they decide to use it.

27:14.557 --> 27:17.150
Also, chances are they
will kill Stonebridge

27:17.185 --> 27:18.930
before you get anywhere near him.

27:19.380 --> 27:21.100
So, what, you go in?

27:21.460 --> 27:25.240
I secure the virus safely,
at least give Stonebridge a chance.

27:25.850 --> 27:28.410
Al-Zuhari's people tried
to kill you before, Leo.

27:28.740 --> 27:30.830
You walk in there, you're
probably not gonna walk out.

27:32.220 --> 27:34.610
Philip, let me go in.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.590
You're outside.
You come in after me.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.242
- You have nothing to lose.
- Richmond goes with you.

27:40.650 --> 27:42.060
Civvies.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.095
Right. Let's get on with it.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.480
I cannot be certain, but
I have a bad, bad feeling

27:47.515 --> 27:50.017
that Ulyanov wants
to hand this virus off

27:50.052 --> 27:52.520
to al-Zuhari's people
soon, very soon.

27:52.550 --> 27:55.490
Helo's on stand-by. Drezna
is 30 klicks from here.

27:56.410 --> 27:58.450
I'll go get Spetsnaz
and we'll meet you there.

27:58.485 --> 28:00.220
Right. We're out of here in 5.

28:00.470 --> 28:03.330
- Are you up to this?
- I have to make a call.

28:03.580 --> 28:04.970
Ester?

28:15.030 --> 28:17.210
<i>What's going on? You
said you'd be back by now.</i>

28:17.220 --> 28:20.565
Yeah...I'm gonna be
a few more days here.

28:20.600 --> 28:22.930
- Oh, no, but you said that you'd be back.
- Yep.

28:23.050 --> 28:26.360
I know what I said,
but things change.

28:27.130 --> 28:28.690
Has something happened?

28:28.820 --> 28:31.780
Ev-everything is fine, Ester.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.330
Listen, when I get
back, we'll do something.

28:34.660 --> 28:36.360
We'll go out somewhere.

28:37.670 --> 28:39.610
But I don't really
want to do anything,

28:39.810 --> 28:42.460
just...be together.

28:43.290 --> 28:45.020
That sounds good to me.

28:46.310 --> 28:48.100
And you'll look
after him, won't you?

28:49.140 --> 28:50.490
Yeah.

28:51.380 --> 28:54.160
- It's what I do, kid.
- Thanks, Damien.

28:55.990 --> 28:57.440
Love you, Dad.

29:00.670 --> 29:02.200
I love you, too.

29:08.240 --> 29:09.730
You all right?

29:13.730 --> 29:15.775
You should know,
I told Ulyanov

29:15.810 --> 29:18.290
you and Stonebridge
were at Black Bear.

29:18.460 --> 29:19.810
I know.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.050
Locke told you already.

29:23.300 --> 29:25.490
Damien, I was in a corner.

29:25.505 --> 29:26.680
Leo...

29:27.510 --> 29:31.000
we're all just pieces
on a board, that's all.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.990
Let's go catch that bird.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.435
- Philip Locke.
- Colonel Voskov.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.980
- The Major briefed you?
- Yeah. - Good.

29:54.790 --> 29:57.490
Your friend, he'll be fine.

29:57.840 --> 29:59.460
Hope so.

30:00.560 --> 30:02.270
That was almost human.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.580
All right, listen up.

30:06.700 --> 30:10.020
You find Stonebridge
and the viral samples, we do the rest.

30:10.035 --> 30:11.400
Sir.

30:11.860 --> 30:14.430
When you get to Stonebridge,
give him this right away.

30:15.310 --> 30:16.790
Let's move.

30:23.910 --> 30:25.990
- You all right?
- Yep.

30:58.620 --> 31:00.340
What are they burning?

31:00.920 --> 31:02.740
I dread to think.

31:11.940 --> 31:13.390
Leo Kamali.

31:14.120 --> 31:15.790
Leo Kamali.

31:24.400 --> 31:25.880
They're in.

31:34.390 --> 31:35.830
Ok?

31:37.640 --> 31:39.530
What are you doing here, Kamali?

31:39.860 --> 31:41.685
Following Al-Zuhari's orders.

31:41.720 --> 31:43.910
Reza Hassan is supposed
to be collecting the packet.

31:43.945 --> 31:48.470
Ah, in times like these,
a little insurance is wise.

31:48.505 --> 31:50.000
Where's Ulyanov?

31:50.360 --> 31:52.440
On his way with Hassan.

31:53.920 --> 31:56.080
- Who is this?
- She's with me.

31:56.580 --> 31:59.680
- You let the American escape.
- We have the Englishman.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.980
Good.
Let's go in.

32:21.100 --> 32:22.670
He is in here.

32:37.960 --> 32:40.360
I will demonstrate on this man.

32:40.570 --> 32:44.280
Mr. Ulyanov wishes to
take care of him in person.

32:46.910 --> 32:48.480
They are here.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.120
Reza Hassan.

33:11.130 --> 33:14.100
If Al-Zuhari's on to
Kamali, he's in trouble.

33:15.940 --> 33:17.380
Ulyanov.

33:19.350 --> 33:22.180
- I'll flip you for him.
- He's mine.

33:22.230 --> 33:23.690
Move.

33:41.350 --> 33:43.720
- Bravo Two in position.
- Stand by.

33:49.620 --> 33:51.120
Assalamu alaikum.

33:51.870 --> 33:54.121
The great day is near, brother.

33:57.522 --> 33:59.122
She is one of us.

34:00.443 --> 34:03.250
Perhaps you've been
absent from us too long.

34:03.257 --> 34:05.461
I had word to join you.

34:17.262 --> 34:18.661
Is this him?

34:26.219 --> 34:27.530
Do it.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.060
It's now or never.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.429
Go.

34:58.740 --> 35:00.400
Motherfucker!

35:07.560 --> 35:09.170
Oh, you bitch!

35:13.200 --> 35:14.860
- You all right?
- Yeah.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.590
- Where's Michael?
- Through there.

35:17.625 --> 35:20.420
- You owe me a beer.
- You wish.

35:40.210 --> 35:42.410
- Hey, you need a key!
- Huh?

35:42.600 --> 35:44.650
- Key!
- Got one.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.100
Hey, Mikey.
You all right?

35:56.260 --> 35:57.855
It's nice of you to show up.

35:57.860 --> 36:01.120
Yeah, well, any sooner and you
wouldn't have appreciated it, huh?

36:01.890 --> 36:03.910
- They do any funny
experiments on you? - Oh, fuck.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.455
- Pricks in your ass?
- Just get me the hell out of here.

36:06.500 --> 36:09.090
- All right. Here you go.
- Nice work.

36:09.670 --> 36:11.905
- Get that in you.
- On your 6! On your 6!

36:19.160 --> 36:20.930
Here. Mikey.

36:21.820 --> 36:23.590
- One up.
- Thank you.

36:25.870 --> 36:27.240
Ok.

36:28.140 --> 36:29.610
Think you can walk?

36:31.620 --> 36:32.375
Yeah.

36:32.410 --> 36:34.180
- I can keep up with you.
- Yeah?

36:34.290 --> 36:36.900
- Feel better already.
- Really? - No.

36:37.410 --> 36:38.880
Oh, shit.

36:48.090 --> 36:49.510
Go!

37:03.620 --> 37:05.010
Mikey!

37:12.100 --> 37:13.410
Shit.

37:13.445 --> 37:14.720
Poor bastard.

37:15.490 --> 37:16.970
Mike, comin' at us.

37:20.120 --> 37:21.550
This way, Mike.

37:22.010 --> 37:23.370
This way.

37:25.420 --> 37:26.840
Ulyanov!

37:27.000 --> 37:28.730
Nina Pirogova.

37:31.150 --> 37:32.590
Ulyanov!

37:39.350 --> 37:40.760
Are you all right?

37:41.560 --> 37:42.920
Fuck!

37:53.030 --> 37:54.850
Oh, shit!

37:55.620 --> 37:57.380
- Kamali!
- Give me the virus!

37:57.415 --> 37:59.030
Stay there!

38:03.870 --> 38:05.410
Cover me!

38:16.660 --> 38:18.120
Come! Come!

38:19.860 --> 38:21.875
Out! Quick! Move!

38:21.910 --> 38:25.365
Zero, seal the building.
They have the virus.

38:26.010 --> 38:27.450
He's with us.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.400
He's all right. He's with me.

38:32.070 --> 38:33.750
- You all right?
- Yeah.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.535
Ulyanov?

38:35.570 --> 38:39.180
You were right.
Always run out at the worst time.

38:39.450 --> 38:42.875
- They got Kamali.
- Buddy, I got to sit this one out.

38:42.885 --> 38:45.125
- Got it.
- It's all right.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.610
Cheers.

39:23.340 --> 39:26.460
So...what's the prognosis?

39:28.290 --> 39:30.320
Well, I won't call
it a mission failure.

39:30.950 --> 39:33.280
They have a weapon,
but we have samples,

39:33.630 --> 39:36.020
and Valigny, the Swedish doctor.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.460
I might get something out of her.

39:39.710 --> 39:42.550
Richmond, she's with the
NATO forensic computer team,

39:43.000 --> 39:45.900
see if they can find the clean
skins uploaded by Andersson.

39:47.440 --> 39:50.490
Actually, I was asking
about my prognosis.

39:50.640 --> 39:53.390
Oh. Ah, you'll be fine.

39:55.560 --> 39:57.270
It's nothing to worry about.

40:00.640 --> 40:03.620
It was a bacterium called
clostridium botulinum.

40:04.710 --> 40:06.410
It was a close one.

40:10.050 --> 40:11.580
What about Leo?

40:13.290 --> 40:14.780
There's no news.

40:15.030 --> 40:17.150
If it wasn't for him,
you would be dead.

40:20.530 --> 40:22.080
He risked his life.

40:23.720 --> 40:27.460
He did everything he could to stop them getting
the virus, and I didn't trust him.

40:27.720 --> 40:29.980
- I thought it was...
- This is not on you.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.670
You know, there was a...

40:37.720 --> 40:39.210
a moment...

40:40.950 --> 40:43.130
where I could feel myself going...

40:46.330 --> 40:48.610
and I wanted it to end.

40:52.240 --> 40:54.470
Best dead than broken, you know?

40:55.920 --> 40:57.290
And now?

40:58.550 --> 41:00.030
I'll be fine.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.730
You want to know
the truth, Michael?

41:05.200 --> 41:07.410
We don't make good old men.

41:08.940 --> 41:10.620
Enjoy the grapes.

41:11.070 --> 41:12.500
Boss.

41:51.640 --> 41:53.660
- Who is it?
- FSB.

41:53.990 --> 41:56.020
Open the fucking door.

42:01.070 --> 42:04.590
- Come in.
- Which one are you intending to use?

42:05.770 --> 42:08.650
Don't know yet.
What kind of mood are you in?

42:09.960 --> 42:13.400
Do you want me to show you how
a Russian girl drinks her vodka?

42:16.780 --> 42:18.320
Yes, I do.

43:44.570 --> 43:46.110
What are you saying?

43:47.270 --> 43:48.720
What?

43:50.640 --> 43:53.580
- Say it in English.
- Fuck me.

43:53.780 --> 43:57.125
- Is that what you were saying?
Really? - Yeah.

43:57.160 --> 43:58.980
You say that a lot.

44:11.500 --> 44:13.080
Oh, my God.

44:15.850 --> 44:18.460
- Fuck that. - What's that?
- It's nothing.

44:25.290 --> 44:26.830
What's up?

44:51.310 --> 44:53.560
My name is Leo Kamali.

44:55.510 --> 44:58.660
"I confess I have
sinned against Allah

44:59.310 --> 45:02.420
and defiled his most blessed name."

45:04.720 --> 45:08.780
"I have betrayed him in
the name of the infidel,

45:09.290 --> 45:10.990
"The Great Satan.

45:13.750 --> 45:17.260
"And I am here to
deliver this message."

45:18.470 --> 45:22.430
"Al-Zuhari will bring down
a vengeance upon the West,

45:22.670 --> 45:25.200
"The like of which
has never been seen.

45:26.630 --> 45:29.790
"My fate is a pure and merciful one

45:30.860 --> 45:33.490
compared with the victims to come."

45:43.720 --> 45:45.190
Fuck!

45:53.130 --> 45:55.250
What am I gonna say
to that little girl?

45:59.950 --> 46:03.260
Leo told us Al-Zuhari
would sacrifice anything,

46:03.440 --> 46:05.480
pay any price to achieve his goals,

46:06.620 --> 46:09.650
and in order to defeat him,
we would have to do the same.

46:09.685 --> 46:12.680
Well, I'm telling you now
that whatever the sacrifice...

46:14.540 --> 46:16.120
it will be made.

46:17.630 --> 46:19.300
And whatever the price,

46:20.480 --> 46:21.990
it will be paid.
