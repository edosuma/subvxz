15:41.776 --> 15:43.107
Yeah.

15:43.109 --> 15:43.945
Of course.

15:45.112 --> 15:48.239
Why would you ask
something like that?

15:48.241 --> 15:49.531
I don't know,
it's just sometimes

15:49.533 --> 15:51.074
I wish that I
could do better for

15:51.076 --> 15:53.910
the both of us like
it used to be before.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.703
Sweetie, you always provide.

15:55.705 --> 15:57.206
Always.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.834
And the way it used to be,
we weren't even that happy.

16:00.836 --> 16:03.421
I mean now we love our careers.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.923
We live comfortably.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.259
And look at me.

16:08.261 --> 16:09.094
Hey.

16:10.429 --> 16:12.011
We have our health.

16:12.013 --> 16:13.097
That's important.

16:13.099 --> 16:14.597
And I love being with you.

16:14.599 --> 16:18.769
I mean we made a decision to
change our lives together.

16:18.771 --> 16:21.230
This is exactly what we wanted.

16:21.232 --> 16:23.106
Even with all the craziness
that we've gone through?

16:23.108 --> 16:26.193
Yes, even with
all the craziness.

16:26.195 --> 16:27.443
Good.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.529
'Cause there's a
lot of craziness.

16:28.531 --> 16:32.116
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, I know that.

16:32.118 --> 16:32.949
Baby.

16:32.951 --> 16:33.785
Yeah?

16:35.246 --> 16:39.039
You truly are the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.794
I love you very,
very, very much.

16:43.128 --> 16:44.546
I love you too.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.263
So cheer up.

16:54.265 --> 16:55.639
Come on.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.724
Let's celebrate.

Okay, cheer up it is.

(TENSE ATMOSPHERE MUSIC)

17:18.330 --> 17:19.996
So you're confident
Markham will

17:19.998 --> 17:21.998
have the situation done today?

17:22.000 --> 17:23.416
Yes sir.

17:23.419 --> 17:27.588
He's putting the finishing
touches on the chip as we speak.

17:27.589 --> 17:28.421
Good.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.547
And the virus and serum?

17:29.549 --> 17:30.841
Trials have been conducted

17:30.843 --> 17:32.802
and completed as
of this morning.

17:32.804 --> 17:37.014
Everything works the way
we were hoping it would.

17:37.016 --> 17:38.431
Good.

17:38.433 --> 17:40.434
The rate he's going,
he'll be done before lunch.

17:40.436 --> 17:42.477
Should we just cut him then?

17:42.479 --> 17:44.146
Let him finish out the day.

17:44.148 --> 17:46.357
So as not to arouse suspicion.

17:46.359 --> 17:47.193
Yes sir.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.528
You should be proud
of yourself, Stern.

17:51.530 --> 17:53.488
You're about to be
part of history.

17:53.490 --> 17:55.740
History that no one
will ever know about.

17:55.742 --> 17:59.620
You want recognition Stern,
you don't join the CIA.

17:59.622 --> 18:01.538
You go with those
FBI pansies who need

18:01.540 --> 18:03.541
a pat on the back for
everything they do.

18:03.543 --> 18:06.043
Oh I'm not looking
for recognition.

18:06.045 --> 18:06.879
Good.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.380
Because we will
always and forever be

18:10.382 --> 18:12.382
the unsung heroes
of this country.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.884
I just mean no one will ever
know what you've done, sir.

18:14.886 --> 18:16.387
The brilliance of it all.

18:16.389 --> 18:19.055
World leaders would
bow down to you.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.560
They would also kill me
to get their hands on this.

18:22.562 --> 18:24.519
Which is why I've
taken every precaution

18:24.521 --> 18:27.065
to make sure that won't happen.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.570
Something on your mind Stern?

18:32.572 --> 18:35.238
Well sir, Markham has
proven to be a valuable asset

18:35.240 --> 18:37.115
since starting his
work on this project.

18:37.117 --> 18:38.784
He's a hard worker, trustworthy,

18:38.786 --> 18:41.120
and he takes his job seriously.

18:41.122 --> 18:44.415
Maybe you should
reconsider his fate, sir.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.708
You've grown fond of him.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.169
When you work day
and night with someone

18:48.171 --> 18:50.629
for a couple years
you tend to bond, sir.

18:50.631 --> 18:52.922
And his wife and mine
have become good friends.

18:52.924 --> 18:55.383
He already knows too
much about the project.

18:55.385 --> 18:57.969
But not enough to
understand what we're doing.

18:57.971 --> 18:59.929
He still thinks the chip
and the virus and serum

18:59.931 --> 19:02.932
are parts of two
unrelated projects.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.560
When this project was started,

19:04.562 --> 19:06.102
you knew all about
the risks, and you

19:06.104 --> 19:09.355
assured me you would
be okay with them.

19:09.357 --> 19:10.483
I did.

19:10.485 --> 19:11.691
I do, sir.

19:11.693 --> 19:14.027
Then you understand
why I can't budge.

19:14.029 --> 19:15.778
Now go on back to the lab.

19:15.780 --> 19:17.072
When he's done, give me a call.

19:17.074 --> 19:18.282
I'll come right down.

19:18.284 --> 19:19.449
We'll test the chip immediately.

19:19.451 --> 19:20.286
Yes sir.

19:49.148 --> 19:51.148
How's it coming along?

19:51.150 --> 19:52.733
Almost done.

19:52.735 --> 19:55.902
Just finished taking off
the excess photo resist.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.613

Director Smith terminated
him from the project.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.715
Being so close to the end,
we didn't need both of you.

20:16.717 --> 20:18.425
Gee, that's too bad.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.511
I mean he's worked so
hard on this project,

20:20.513 --> 20:23.805
not to see it to the
end, so many hours.

20:23.807 --> 20:26.059
Just seems kinda odd right?

20:28.563 --> 20:31.272
Deputy Smith is gonna
ask you for the equations.

20:31.274 --> 20:34.526
Do yourself a favor
and hold onto them.

long hours and hard work

20:45.787 --> 20:47.787
that I've been putting
in on this project,

20:47.789 --> 20:50.707
and the great job that you're
always saying I'm doing,

20:50.709 --> 20:53.043
perhaps you could put
a good word in for me

20:53.045 --> 20:56.755
with Director Smith
about a possible raise?

20:56.757 --> 21:00.260
I mean of course if
the chip is a success.

21:05.892 --> 21:07.557
Sure.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.767
I'll see what I can do.

means one thing.

for the base to dissolve,

not doing so well.

for the second time.

fine, has been locked

Laverne since we injected her.

obviously got it elsewhere.

43:15.888 --> 43:18.054

vetting skills are lax

43:18.056 --> 43:21.977

capable of the same skills.

revealed something beforehand.

"You have no idea who
you're messing with."

past that you don't know.

rigorous background checks.

on the run and able

your men at once.

Oh no, I'm not
gonna be banking

of a personal issue.

these games, Miss Markham.

45:01.118 --> 45:02.370

get your kicks,

So what's going on now?

01:02:25.245 --> 01:02:27.163
Well I went to work
for the CIA in the

01:02:27.165 --> 01:02:30.875
science department right
after I faked my death.

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:33.377
Everything was going real
well until two years ago,

01:02:33.379 --> 01:02:36.172
my boss's boss handpicked
me to help in the

01:02:36.174 --> 01:02:40.049
creation of a virus, its
antidote, and a nano chip.

01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:41.886
I was led to believe
that all three of them

01:02:41.888 --> 01:02:44.346
were created for
different reasons.

01:02:44.348 --> 01:02:49.225
But today they were tested,
after I completed it,

01:02:49.227 --> 01:02:52.897
and I found out they were
created for one specific reason.

01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:54.899
And the bullet
wounds tell me that

01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:57.067
it's probably not a
good specific reason?

01:02:57.069 --> 01:02:58.569
No it's not.

01:02:58.571 --> 01:03:02.739
See, they wanted to spread
the virus worldwide,

01:03:02.741 --> 01:03:04.699
making it mandatory
that the antidote

01:03:04.701 --> 01:03:09.078
be administered to each
individual with the virus.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.748
Otherwise if they didn't take it

01:03:10.750 --> 01:03:14.585
they would die in
about a month or so.

01:03:14.587 --> 01:03:17.337
But what the people
would not know

01:03:17.339 --> 01:03:20.007
is that the nano chip
would be within

01:03:20.009 --> 01:03:22.551
the antidote embedding
itself into the host's

01:03:22.553 --> 01:03:25.763
brain allowing
complete mind control.

01:03:25.765 --> 01:03:27.598
They tested it on mice today.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:29.266
And it worked.

01:03:29.268 --> 01:03:31.020

01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.728

come to me first.

want anyone to link us

01:09:30.212 --> 01:09:32.796

things went sour.

01:09:32.799 --> 01:09:34.255

for this to backfire on us.

for my family.

you say anything?
