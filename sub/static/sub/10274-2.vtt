WEBVTT

00:00.220 --> 00:03.474
-Previously on "The Americans."

00:03.480 --> 00:04.572
-Who killed Vlad?

00:04.580 --> 00:05.365
-I don't know.

00:05.370 --> 00:07.463
-Don't lie to me.

00:07.470 --> 00:08.437
-mom.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.907
-Happy birthday, Henry.

00:14.140 --> 00:15.801
-We have to be
able to trust each.

00:15.810 --> 00:17.425
-I know, I'm sorry.

00:17.430 --> 00:18.499
-And Amelia?

00:18.510 --> 00:19.499
-Ninth grade, cheerleading.

00:19.510 --> 00:21.057
-Oh my god, no.

00:21.060 --> 00:21.754
-Yes.

00:21.760 --> 00:22.954
Most of our mother
and daughter time

00:22.960 --> 00:26.748
is spend cooking for bake sales,
and there's boys, boys, boys.

00:26.760 --> 00:29.092
-Nothing much else to
worry about, these kids.

00:29.100 --> 00:31.682
-Nothing prepares you
for them growing up.

00:31.690 --> 00:33.635
-An agent called the service,
with surveillance tight,

00:33.640 --> 00:35.232
we can't do a dead drop.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.083
I've got him coming
here to do a pass.

00:37.090 --> 00:37.875
It can't be me.

00:37.880 --> 00:39.177
He's going to be
looking for a blue hat

00:39.180 --> 00:41.432
and an 11-year-old boy.

00:41.440 --> 00:43.328
-We don't use our kids.

00:43.330 --> 00:46.083
-Grey pants, grey blazer,
green tie with white pattern.

00:50.300 --> 00:50.994
-Nina?

00:54.830 --> 00:55.524
Paige and Henry.

00:55.530 --> 00:56.224
Go.

00:59.170 --> 01:01.377
I should have done
it without Henry.

01:01.380 --> 01:03.143
-He's supposed to be
with Martha tonight.

01:03.150 --> 01:03.844
-No,no.

01:03.850 --> 01:04.839
I'll make an excuse.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.513
-No, if the FBI were part of
this, if they know about this,

01:07.520 --> 01:08.487
we need to find out.

01:08.490 --> 01:09.400
-Who would do this?

01:09.410 --> 01:11.071
-Want the list?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.149
Someone who knows us.

01:12.150 --> 01:13.435
Every single one of us.

01:13.440 --> 01:14.566
Someone who_is
onto the operation.

01:18.040 --> 01:41.296
2! 7! 1! OI
3, 6, 4, 2, 9, 7, 2, 9, 5, 3.

01:48.730 --> 01:50.209
Mom, we're up.

02:09.980 --> 02:11.049
-Get the oranges out.

02:11.060 --> 02:11.754
-All right.

02:16.740 --> 02:18.219
Have a great day.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.199
Mike,
you forgot your backpack.

02:53.580 --> 02:55.468
-Oh, this looks fabulous.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.539
-You OK?

02:57.550 --> 03:00.246
-I'm not feeling so great.

03:00.250 --> 03:00.944
-So don't push it.

03:00.950 --> 03:03.578
Take a sick day.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.979
-I've got a lot to do today.

03:04.980 --> 03:05.992
-They're lucky to have you.

03:11.970 --> 03:13.665
-You know, I saw in
the Bureau newsletter

03:13.670 --> 03:17.447
that there's a senior
clerk pOSItlon opening up.

03:17.450 --> 03:19.429
-What department?

03:19.430 --> 03:21.341
-Office of Equal
Employment Opportunity.

03:24.010 --> 03:27.559
You know, secretaries usually
top out at GS7, senior clerks,

03:27.560 --> 03:29.346
they go all the way to GS9.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.363
-We||, are there
any clerk openings

03:31.370 --> 03:33.247
in counter intelligence?

03:33.250 --> 03:35.866
-No, not right now.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.384
-You should talk to personnel,
put in an application

03:38.390 --> 03:41.405
so you're top of the list the
next time one opens up there.

03:41.410 --> 03:44.436
-We||, sure but this
one is open now.

03:47.620 --> 03:50.589
-Martha, you're
smart, you're capable,

03:50.600 --> 03:53.216
you're working in a department
that does important work.

03:53.220 --> 03:55.677
I mean, don't you
want to stay and rise

03:55.680 --> 03:58.205
up somewhere where you
can make a difference?

03:58.210 --> 03:59.199
-Hm.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.622
What was supposed

04:00.630 --> 04:02.507
to be a family weekend
getaway turned tragic--

04:02.510 --> 04:03.465
-You're right.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.085
Agent Gaad would be luclq
to have me as a clerk.

04:05.090 --> 04:06.717
and daughter, Amelia,

04:06.720 --> 04:09.848
were brutally gunned down
in an 11 floor room--

04:09.850 --> 04:11.511
-Oh, this is awful.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.112
police have arrested--

04:13.120 --> 04:14.064
-What happened?

04:14.070 --> 04:18.404
-A family was murdered in
their hotel room in Alexandria.

04:18.410 --> 04:19.434
The parents and their daughter.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.285
-Good lord.

04:25.290 --> 04:27.019
-Now, do you think
this is a burglary

04:27.030 --> 04:28.770
or some Charles
Manson type thing?

04:28.780 --> 04:31.510
-Martha, it's not a
Charles Manson thing.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.249
-OK.

04:33.250 --> 04:34.478
Have a safe flight, hon.

04:34.490 --> 04:35.366
-Love you.

04:35.370 --> 04:36.792
-Love you too.

04:36.800 --> 04:41.294
-Express shock and outrage and
phones are ringing off the hook

04:41.300 --> 04:43.643
at a local security company
where many have inquired

04:43.650 --> 04:46.642
about installing alarm
systems in their home.

04:46.650 --> 04:49.892
-They were killed in a hotel
right near old town Alexandria.

04:52.820 --> 04:53.957
-God, turn that off.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.609
-But it's the news.

06:34.610 --> 06:37.010
-I don't think so but--
good morning, Mr. Phillip.

06:37.020 --> 06:38.066
-Morning, Stavos.

06:38.070 --> 06:39.549
-I need to talk to you about--

06:39.550 --> 06:41.120
-Give me five minutes
and I Will be all yours.

06:49.060 --> 06:50.925
What did Moscow say?

06:50.930 --> 06:53.660
-I didn't get the signal.

06:53.670 --> 06:57.777
The kids were up, I didn't
want to leave them downstairs.

06:57.780 --> 06:58.769
-OK.

06:58.780 --> 07:00.759
-Martha?

07:00.770 --> 07:02.385
-Hour and a half in
Gaad's office on the tape,

07:02.390 --> 07:04.472
but not a word
about the murders.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.368
They're not on it at FBI.

07:06.370 --> 07:09.760
They do not know who
Emmett and Leann are.

07:09.770 --> 07:11.818
Let's just see
what Moscow knows.

07:11.820 --> 07:13.708
You wanna make the drop?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.835
Get out on the street a little?

07:14.840 --> 07:15.852
I can listen to the numbers.

07:17.070 --> 07:17.934
-Come in.

07:17.940 --> 07:19.043
-Hey.

07:19.050 --> 07:19.744
-Stan.

07:19.750 --> 07:21.547
-Hey, sorry to
barge in like this.

07:21.550 --> 07:22.949
Is this a bad moment?

07:22.960 --> 07:23.745
-No, are you kidding?

07:23.750 --> 07:24.444
-Never.

07:24.450 --> 07:25.439
-Oh, great, great.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.202
-How are you?

07:26.210 --> 07:26.653
-Good, good.

07:26.660 --> 07:27.797
I've brought some
friends with me.

07:27.800 --> 07:28.653
-Great.

07:28.660 --> 07:30.116
-This is Mike Orendorrf.

07:30.120 --> 07:30.814
-Mike.

07:30.820 --> 07:31.741
-And this is Stewart Bally.

07:31.750 --> 07:32.444
-Hi.

07:32.450 --> 07:33.712
-Mike works down
the hall from me,

07:33.720 --> 07:35.722
and Stewart's his
brother-in-law.

07:35.730 --> 07:38.528
He's getting married to a very
lovely young lady named Sarah.

07:38.530 --> 07:39.485
-Oh, great.

07:39.490 --> 07:40.536
-Second marriage.

07:40.540 --> 07:41.962
Gonna do it right this time.

07:41.970 --> 07:42.811
-Yeah.

07:42.820 --> 07:43.661
Right.

07:43.670 --> 07:46.946
So we need a bachelor
weekend, March 12 to 14,

07:46.950 --> 07:48.759
something that's not going
to wreck the marriage.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.454
-OK.

07:49.460 --> 07:50.131
Budget?

07:50.140 --> 07:51.334
-We||, Stewart owns
his own plumbing

07:51.340 --> 07:53.422
business, very successful.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.988
-Maybe Montreal?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.888
I mean, it can be a little
cold that time of year,

07:56.890 --> 07:59.506
but it's very European, and
it's only a two hour flight.

08:02.290 --> 08:05.373
-Or there's that great
dude ranch in Kentucky.

08:05.380 --> 08:06.529
We sent some guys
there last year,

08:06.540 --> 08:09.259
you know, horseback riding,
trout fishing, dove hunting.

08:09.260 --> 08:10.579
They brew their own moonshine.

08:10.590 --> 08:11.284
-I told ya.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.838
This is the guy-- guys.

08:13.840 --> 08:17.549
-Let me, uh, let me
show you a brochure.

08:17.560 --> 08:19.767
-My mother has that same
clock in her kitchen.

08:20.470 --> 08:21.164
-Yeah.

10:47.570 --> 10:49.606
-I got the signal.

10:49.610 --> 10:50.304
Chesapeake tonight.

10:50.310 --> 10:52.289
They want us to check
out Emmett's agent.

10:52.300 --> 10:53.949
-Do they think he did it?

10:53.960 --> 10:54.654
-I don't know.

10:54.660 --> 10:56.480
I don't think they know.

10:56.490 --> 10:57.855
If Emmett's agent
turned, they definitely

10:57.860 --> 11:00.658
had someone watching the
brush pass in Alexandria.

11:00.670 --> 11:03.184
-If that happened, they
would have gotten us by now.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.498
-Why not?

11:04.500 --> 11:06.718
-Either way, we still have
to check out this guy.

11:09.950 --> 11:10.644
-You go.

11:10.650 --> 11:13.392
I'm gonna stay with the kids.

11:13.400 --> 11:16.506
-OK, good.

11:16.510 --> 11:17.204
Good.

11:21.010 --> 11:22.693
The
Soviet foreign minister

11:22.700 --> 11:24.577
wasn't pleased one
of his diplomats

11:24.580 --> 11:27.185
got shot in the
back of the head.

11:27.190 --> 11:29.875
His body
was found in a dumpster.

11:29.880 --> 11:31.848
DC's a dangerous place.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.648
The State
keeps asking questions.

11:34.650 --> 11:37.187
I can't really give
answers, someone

11:37.190 --> 11:38.225
may have to take the fall.

12:59.230 --> 13:01.642
-I just think the teachers
should communicate

13:01.650 --> 13:04.437
so if Miss Bell gives us
a maths test on Thursday,

13:04.440 --> 13:07.682
Mr. Abernathy doesn't give us
a history test the same day

13:07.690 --> 13:09.271
because you can't
study enough for both.

13:09.280 --> 13:09.974
-Right.

13:09.980 --> 13:11.038
-You don't learn anything.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.338
And you get bad grades, then
you just don't feel good.

13:13.340 --> 13:14.455
-Right.

13:14.460 --> 13:17.645
-Dad, do you really have to go?

13:17.650 --> 13:21.780
-Three new agencies have
opened up in the last month.

13:21.790 --> 13:24.998
The one around the corner is
offering Incluswe packages.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.399
-What's inclusive packages?

13:26.410 --> 13:28.298
-It's where they give
you all your food,

13:28.300 --> 13:30.951
airfare, hotel, you just pay
once, then you forget about it.

13:30.960 --> 13:31.654
-Oh.

13:31.660 --> 13:33.969
-The problem is we have to
figure out a way to keep up.

13:33.970 --> 13:35.153
We could be wiped out.

13:35.160 --> 13:39.005
-What it help if we came to
work with you on the weekends?

13:39.010 --> 13:40.079
-No, it's not that bad.

13:40.080 --> 13:40.774
He's exaggerating.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.145
Come here.

13:42.150 --> 13:45.096
-But I do have to travel
more, you know, make

13:45.100 --> 13:47.045
friends with _the hotel
managers, figure out

13:47.050 --> 13:48.608
a way we can be better
than the competition,

13:48.620 --> 13:52.511
so I will see you
in a couple of days.

13:52.520 --> 13:53.214
Bye.

13:53.220 --> 13:54.187
-Bye.

13:54.190 --> 13:55.248
-Bye, team.

13:55.250 --> 13:56.217
-Bye, Dad.

14:02.790 --> 14:03.484
-Come on.

14:07.860 --> 14:10.465
-mom, come on.

14:10.470 --> 14:11.164
-Coming.

14:34.200 --> 14:38.102
Mr. Dameran, I'm very sorry
to speak to you in this way

14:38.110 --> 14:40.874
instead of in person.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.724
-We||-- well, then
speak to me in person.

14:43.730 --> 14:45.766
Look, I put my life on
the line to get here.

14:45.770 --> 14:46.976
I don't think it's
asking much too

14:46.980 --> 14:49.767
talk to an actual human being.

14:49.770 --> 14:52.238
-I understand
completely, and we're

14:52.250 --> 14:54.593
very grateful you've come.

14:54.600 --> 14:59.378
Just, we have procedures we
absolutely have to follow.

14:59.390 --> 15:00.470
I'm very sorry.

15:00.480 --> 15:02.289
-I have to be at
work in 25 minutes.

15:02.290 --> 15:04.269
You get somebody in
here or I'll leave.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.430
-You're absolutely right.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.101
I'm taking care of it now.

15:10.110 --> 15:10.804
I'm sorry.

15:21.410 --> 15:26.803
-Some of these frustrations,
despite our numerous efforts,

15:26.810 --> 15:28.573
have not been solved yet.

15:28.580 --> 15:32.232
-Look, I want to do something
really important for the cause,

15:32.240 --> 15:35.255
but if I'm caught coming in
around at the embassy, it'll--

15:35.260 --> 15:36.500
-Of course.

15:36.510 --> 15:40.640
Mr. Dameran, I understand
if you cannot wait.

15:40.650 --> 15:45.804
Just maybe, you want to
tell me a little bit now

17:35.050 --> 17:35.823
-How's it going?

17:35.830 --> 17:37.912
Any look on the contracts?

17:37.920 --> 17:39.979
-So far, nothing, but
I'm just getting started.

17:39.980 --> 17:42.915
How are the kids?

17:42.920 --> 17:45.036
-I'm about to pick them up.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.213
-Yeah, better than
the bus today.

17:47.220 --> 17:49.268
That's good.

17:49.270 --> 17:50.385
Bye, honey.

17:50.390 --> 17:51.880
-I'll talk to you later.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.981
-I almost gave up on you.

21:29.990 --> 21:33.062
-We have a walk-in.

21:33.070 --> 21:35.766
-What do you now about it?

21:35.770 --> 21:36.919
-I'm not on the
team handling it.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.296
I haven't heard much.

21:38.300 --> 21:40.188
-Well, do you know
what time he came in?

21:40.190 --> 21:40.986
-No.

21:40.990 --> 21:42.503
-Well, when was
the first time you

21:42.510 --> 21:44.239
heard somebody talking about it?

21:44.250 --> 21:45.535
-About 11 o'clock.

21:48.330 --> 21:50.798
-We||, tell me about
our Arkady's movements.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.485
-He's in and out of his
office all day, very busy.

21:54.490 --> 21:56.299
-After 11 o'clock?

21:56.310 --> 22:00.599
-Yes, until about 2 o'clock.

22:00.600 --> 22:01.999
He was in there very long time.

22:02.010 --> 22:03.784
-You see any cables going out?

22:03.790 --> 22:04.996
-There's always cables.

22:05.000 --> 22:06.501
-Anything high priority?

22:06.510 --> 22:08.990
-No, I wasn't close
enough to see.

22:09.000 --> 22:11.468
I'm sorry I don't have more.

22:11.470 --> 22:13.119
-This is good.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.109
This is very good.

22:18.620 --> 22:20.770
I gotta get on it.

22:20.780 --> 22:22.179
-Your report can wait an hour.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.401
Come here.

22:36.070 --> 22:38.482
-So he's not in?

22:38.490 --> 22:42.312
Well, can I leave
him a message then?

22:42.320 --> 22:45.255
Tell them, I really
enjoyed our dinner.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.216
The steak was excellent.

22:47.220 --> 22:49.677
Did you get that?

22:49.680 --> 22:53.184
I really enjoyed our dinner.

22:53.190 --> 22:56.944
The steak was excellent.

22:56.950 --> 22:58.178
OK.

22:58.180 --> 22:58.874
Thanks.

23:02.150 --> 23:06.052
-Fred, um, we need to talk.

23:06.060 --> 23:07.084
I'm a friend of Paul's.

23:10.340 --> 23:12.991
You're-- you're doing great.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.467
You just send them
an emergency signal

23:14.470 --> 23:16.188
and now you're on
your escape plan.

23:16.190 --> 23:19.580
You probably think
I'm FBI or DOD

23:19.590 --> 23:24.630
or Lockheed Security or CIA.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.744
I know you feared
this day would come.

23:26.750 --> 23:30.493
Paul warned you, prepared you
probably and rigged that box

23:30.500 --> 23:32.411
for you, but this is
something different.

23:32.420 --> 23:33.956
Nobody has caught you.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.030
Fred, listen to me.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.462
Listen to me.

23:37.470 --> 23:39.426
We've met before.

23:39.430 --> 23:41.398
In old town Alexander, you
were supposed to hand something

23:41.400 --> 23:43.413
to Paul, but he couldn't do
it so you handed it to me.

23:43.420 --> 23:46.002
I looked different
then, but look close.

23:46.010 --> 23:47.716
It's me.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.460
Man in blue baseball
cap with a boy.

23:49.470 --> 23:50.198
How could I know that?

23:54.530 --> 23:56.441
-I can think of a lot or ways.

24:02.710 --> 24:05.861
-OK, I'll take the
automobile insurance.

24:05.870 --> 24:06.575
-Uh0huh.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.707
-Can I go watch TV?

24:08.710 --> 24:10.985
-I'm almost at retirement.

24:10.990 --> 24:13.129
-He always wants to watch
TV when he's behind.

24:13.130 --> 24:14.415
-Maybe I'm just
a little bit more

24:14.420 --> 24:16.126
interest in real
life than the game.

24:16.130 --> 24:16.949
-Yeah.

24:16.950 --> 24:18.247
Real life, watching TV.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.134
-Hello?

24:39.850 --> 24:41.545
Mom, it's your turn.

24:41.550 --> 24:42.244
-Hang on.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.672
I have to take a
message for Dad.

25:04.300 --> 25:07.736
-mom, I'm bored.

25:07.740 --> 25:08.718
-You know what?

25:08.720 --> 25:10.335
You guys want to go see a movie?

25:10.340 --> 25:11.955
-Yeah.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.689
-We could go see "Raiders
of the Lost Ark."

25:13.690 --> 25:14.634
-Cool.

25:14.640 --> 25:17.757
-If we left right now, we
could make the next show.

25:17.760 --> 25:19.102
-I thought we're
having family time.

25:19.110 --> 25:21.089
-You'd rather play Life
than watch "Raiders

25:21.100 --> 25:21.794
of the Lost Ark?"

25:21.800 --> 25:22.630
Are you insane?

25:22.640 --> 25:23.902
-We can have family
time at the movie.

25:23.910 --> 25:27.346
You guys, come on,
go get your coats.

25:27.350 --> 25:28.066
Quick, quick, quick.

25:36.440 --> 25:40.069
-Fred, you have
to untie my hands.

25:40.080 --> 25:41.308
-I still don't know who you are.

25:41.320 --> 25:42.378
-You do know who I am.

25:42.380 --> 25:45.452
I've told you who I am, and
we do not have much time.

25:45.460 --> 25:47.189
-I'm sorry.

25:47.200 --> 25:48.804
I'm so sorry I have to do this.

25:51.510 --> 25:52.852
-Those model-- the model kits.

25:52.860 --> 25:54.953
Those model kits that
you have In your closet.

25:54.960 --> 25:57.838
They were gifts for
his son, weren't they?

25:57.840 --> 25:58.795
Weren't they?

26:02.150 --> 26:03.754
We don't usually tell
people about our kids,

26:03.760 --> 26:05.796
so you must really
mean a lot to him.

26:05.800 --> 26:08.917
It is OK, Fred.

26:08.920 --> 26:10.581
Fred, it's OK.

26:10.590 --> 26:13.718
You know, it's the truth.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.835
We're both his friends.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.215
-I'm gonna meet him.

26:35.220 --> 26:36.369
I'll tell him
about you, and then

26:36.380 --> 26:38.860
we'll see what he wants to do.

26:38.870 --> 26:41.247
-You can't.

26:41.250 --> 26:43.969
-Why?

26:43.970 --> 26:47.610
-Is there any chance
that you told somebody

26:47.620 --> 26:48.894
about your
relationship with Paul

26:48.900 --> 26:51.539
or that they
guessed by accident?

26:51.540 --> 26:52.529
Even the littlest-- I know.

26:52.540 --> 26:54.053
I know you would never
betray him on purpose.

26:54.060 --> 26:54.754
I know that.

26:54.760 --> 26:59.572
But is there any chance
someone found out?

26:59.580 --> 27:01.024
-Why are you asking me this?

27:01.030 --> 27:03.078
-Because it's important.

27:03.080 --> 27:04.513
-No.

27:04.520 --> 27:06.681
Of course not.

27:06.690 --> 27:08.738
-Why did your surveillance
tighten up on you in DC?

27:08.740 --> 27:11.208
-They tightened up on
everybody at the meetings.

27:11.220 --> 27:11.959
They're paranoid.

27:11.970 --> 27:13.813
Now, tell me what
the hell is going on!

27:13.820 --> 27:14.661
-I believe you.

27:14.670 --> 27:15.364
I do.

27:15.370 --> 27:17.520
I-- I-- I_see all that
money In your bag.

27:17.530 --> 27:18.986
You didn't spend a penny.
You didn't do it for the money.

27:18.990 --> 27:21.276
You did it for something much
bigger, just like Paul said.

27:21.280 --> 27:23.498
I understand why he trusted you.

27:23.510 --> 27:24.317
I do.

27:27.900 --> 27:29.276
Fred, I have to
tell you something,

27:29.280 --> 27:30.508
and it is going to be hard.

27:34.100 --> 27:36.421
Did you see the story about
the couple that was murdered

27:36.430 --> 27:38.933
in a hotel room in
old town Alexandria?

27:38.940 --> 27:39.736
-With there daughter.

27:39.740 --> 27:40.434
-Yes.

27:43.420 --> 27:44.159
That was Paul.

27:47.590 --> 27:48.363
-No, it wasn't.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.721
I saw the picture in the paper.

27:53.730 --> 27:56.335
-No, you only ever
saw him in disguise,

27:56.340 --> 27:58.183
like I'm wearing now,
for your own protection.

28:10.190 --> 28:10.884
-Why?

28:15.390 --> 28:19.941
Why are you saying this?

28:19.950 --> 28:22.487
-Because it's the truth,
and you need to know.

28:54.750 --> 28:55.887
-Dammit.

28:55.890 --> 28:56.800
You guys, I forgot.

28:56.810 --> 28:59.415
I promised Dad I'd finish
ticketing this tour package

28:59.420 --> 29:01.229
we have to get out
by tomorrow morning.

29:01.230 --> 29:04.108
I'm going to have to drop
you guys off at the movie.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.977
-You're not coming with us?

29:06.980 --> 29:08.242
-You missed the turn, mom.

29:08.250 --> 29:10.434
-I'|| circle back around.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.453
I'll get there as
soon as I can, guys.

29:27.370 --> 29:29.998
-What was his real name?

29:30.000 --> 29:30.694
-Emmett.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.767
He didn't really take
to a lot of people.

29:36.770 --> 29:40.661
For him, you had to see the
world for the way it really is.

29:40.670 --> 29:43.537
-We talked about that a lot.

29:43.540 --> 29:47.158
Most people live their
lives, punch their clock,

29:47.160 --> 29:53.247
but they never do anything,
accomplish anything.

29:53.250 --> 29:56.037
-I know.

29:56.040 --> 30:03.003
-His wife, his daughter, and
that poor son left all alone.

30:07.020 --> 30:12.174
All that money, I
wanna give it to him.

30:12.180 --> 30:15.877
-We can't, but he'll
be taken care of.

30:20.070 --> 30:25.485
-That boy you were with in
Alexandria, was that your son?

30:31.190 --> 30:34.114
-I'm not really supposed
to talk about it.

30:34.120 --> 30:38.580
But, um, I'll be in touch.

30:38.590 --> 30:39.705
-Did you get the settings?

30:39.710 --> 30:42.292
Can you people build off them?

30:42.300 --> 30:44.461
-What settings?

30:44.470 --> 30:45.448
-On the machine.

30:45.450 --> 30:49.295
The information I gave
you in Alexandria.

30:49.300 --> 30:51.530
-Everything's been on hold
because of what happened.

30:51.540 --> 30:52.666
-It can't be on hold.

30:52.670 --> 30:56.788
The-- the plant where they're
grinding the propellers

30:56.790 --> 30:57.609
is moving.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.848
It's the one chance
to get In there

30:58.860 --> 31:00.236
and read the settings
on the machine.

31:22.470 --> 31:23.721
Who are you?

31:26.960 --> 31:28.143
Who are you?

31:28.150 --> 31:28.844
I need help.

31:28.850 --> 31:30.477
Did you come to help me?

31:36.160 --> 31:38.867
-Those are not the
words I'm looking for.

31:38.870 --> 31:42.328
What do you need help with?

31:42.340 --> 31:44.194
-Fixing my car.

31:44.200 --> 31:46.100
I need-- I need
help fixing my car.

31:46.110 --> 31:46.804
-Keep trying.

31:49.590 --> 31:52.900
-Ma'am, did you come to
help me fix my car tonight?

31:52.910 --> 31:56.038
-Yes, I heard you had a break
down, and I came to help.

32:02.460 --> 32:05.679
-I was-- I was out
with him and he said,

32:05.690 --> 32:07.897
do you want to have fun?

32:07.900 --> 32:10.505
-Give me the gun.

32:10.510 --> 32:14.469
He brought me here
to take drugs.

32:14.480 --> 32:16.812
I-- I don't know-- I
don't know what to,

32:16.820 --> 32:18.287
um-- I don't know what to do.

32:18.290 --> 32:19.757
I can't-- I can't think.

32:19.760 --> 32:20.454
-It's OK.

32:20.460 --> 32:21.154
I'm here.

32:21.160 --> 32:21.899
It's OK.

32:28.110 --> 32:31.591
Well, good news, he's not dead.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.238
What's your
relationship with him?

32:33.240 --> 32:35.083
-He's a Congressional aide.

32:35.090 --> 32:38.469
He works for a congressman,
the intelligence

32:38.480 --> 32:40.732
committee overseeing
Central America.

32:40.740 --> 32:43.117
-Who does he think you are?

32:43.120 --> 32:46.601
-A graduate student in political
science from Costa Rica.

32:46.610 --> 32:47.747
I can't breathe.

32:47.750 --> 32:49.297
I can't-- I can't breathe.

32:49.300 --> 32:52.087
-Do you know what you took?

32:52.090 --> 32:55.230
-We smoked cocaine,
and I took pills.

33:04.100 --> 33:05.044
-You're going to be OK.

33:05.050 --> 33:06.494
Look at me.

33:06.500 --> 33:07.649
How long have you been here?

33:07.660 --> 33:08.763
In the US?

33:08.770 --> 33:09.475
-Two months.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.799
-You're doing fine.

33:10.800 --> 33:11.573
Things can go wrong.

33:11.580 --> 33:12.456
They usually do.

33:12.460 --> 33:15.304
It's part of the job,
but we get through it.

33:15.310 --> 33:16.481
You'll get through this.

33:16.490 --> 33:18.355
I want you to sit here, and
I want you to watch him.

33:18.360 --> 33:19.054
Can you do that?

33:19.060 --> 33:20.413
-Uh-huh.

33:20.420 --> 33:21.682
-OK.

33:21.690 --> 33:22.384
-Wait.

33:22.390 --> 33:23.084
Where are you going?

33:23.090 --> 33:24.375
-I'm going to buy you something.

33:24.380 --> 33:25.551
I'll be back soon.

33:32.300 --> 33:33.232
-Who's the next one?

33:37.930 --> 33:38.646
-Greg Arenko.

33:41.160 --> 33:42.889
-That's him.

33:42.900 --> 33:44.299
What time did he go in?

33:44.310 --> 33:46.449
10:42.

33:46.450 --> 33:47.576
-Is this the last one we got?

33:47.580 --> 33:48.274
-Yep.

33:48.280 --> 33:49.212
-Where are we?

33:49.220 --> 33:50.835
-We started with the
surveIIIance photos

33:50.840 --> 33:53.809
at 10:00 AM, an hour before the
source first heard anything,

33:53.820 --> 33:55.230
and work our way
to 2:00 PM, when

33:55.240 --> 33:56.730
they said things settled down.

33:56.740 --> 33:58.856
We got everybody going in
and out of the Soviet Embassy

33:58.860 --> 34:01.067
between those hours
and eliminated

34:01.070 --> 34:02.560
the people we know
who work there.

34:05.230 --> 34:06.333
These are the four
that are left.

34:09.830 --> 34:13.891
One of them should
be the walk-in.

34:13.900 --> 34:16.698
-Last guy who walked
into the Soviet Embassy

34:16.710 --> 34:20.976
gave them the trigger designs
they use on all their nukes.

34:20.980 --> 34:23.312
Let's figure out who this
guy is before Khrushchev

34:23.320 --> 34:24.890
starts building his
own space shuttle.

34:31.310 --> 34:32.004
-Drink.

34:32.010 --> 34:34.672
All of it.

34:34.680 --> 34:37.069
When he wakes up, tell
him you saved his life.

34:37.080 --> 34:40.379
And by not taking him to the
hospital, you saved his future.

34:40.390 --> 34:42.244
Probably wants to
be a senator, right?

34:42.250 --> 34:42.944
-Probab|y.

34:43.740 --> 34:45.844
-Eat those.

34:45.850 --> 34:47.351
Don't party with him anymore.

34:47.360 --> 34:49.828
Be his girlfriend.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.319
-Thank you.

34:51.320 --> 34:53.368
-I wish I could stay with
you, but I have to go.

34:53.370 --> 34:54.348
You're going to be OK.

34:59.810 --> 35:02.335
Your revolution is
beautiful, a foothold

35:02.340 --> 35:04.456
for us in Central America.

35:04.460 --> 35:06.269
We're here to help you.

35:06.270 --> 35:06.964
Call any time.

35:19.280 --> 35:20.429
-What do you got?

35:20.440 --> 35:21.873
-Three of our four are out.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.507
Two were fixing the
AC at the embassy,

35:23.510 --> 35:25.705
one was bringing lunch.

35:25.710 --> 35:29.862
-So tell me you gotta
name on this guy.

35:29.870 --> 35:31.064
-Bruce Dameran.

35:31.070 --> 35:33.800
36-years-old.

35:33.810 --> 35:37.166
-Born in Reno, Nevada.

35:37.170 --> 35:39.843
Purple heart in Vietnam.

35:39.850 --> 35:41.989
Seven years employed,
department of agriculture.

35:41.990 --> 35:43.526
-Currently employed, World Bank.

35:46.170 --> 35:49.662
-Well, that's a nice spot for
the Soviets to get a source.

35:49.670 --> 35:50.716
-Bring him in?

35:54.200 --> 35:57.681
-Not yet.

36:18.540 --> 36:19.916
Any news?

36:19.920 --> 36:22.013
Yeah, I talked to him.

36:22.020 --> 36:22.816
-You what?

36:22.820 --> 36:24.117
It's a long story,

36:24.120 --> 36:25.747
but he didn't do anything.

36:25.750 --> 36:27.069
Are you sure?

36:27.080 --> 36:29.765
-Yeah.

36:29.770 --> 36:32.079
-Good.

36:32.090 --> 36:42.182
-So, Martha has a 102.

36:42.190 --> 36:44.954
-Um, you should
probably go over there.

36:44.960 --> 36:46.040
-Are you OK?

36:54.310 --> 36:55.004
-Yeah.

36:55.010 --> 36:58.229
I'll talk to you
when you get home.

36:58.230 --> 37:00.482
-OK, bye.

37:35.920 --> 37:38.900
-We have a walk-in.

37:38.910 --> 37:40.832
-We||, tell me about
Arkady's movements.

38:44.880 --> 38:45.574
-Da.

38:57.360 --> 38:59.180
Hello?

38:59.190 --> 38:59.884
-How are you feeling?

39:02.420 --> 39:03.933
-I don't know what happened.

39:03.940 --> 39:07.808
It wasn't like this yesterday,
but then it just hit me.

39:07.810 --> 39:10.040
Aanay, um, guess what?

39:10.050 --> 39:13.554
I talked to personnel today,
and even though there aren't

39:13.560 --> 39:18.122
any clerk openings in
counter-intelligence right now,

39:18.130 --> 39:20.746
they gave me an
application to fill out.

39:20.750 --> 39:23.878
So if something opens,
I will be on the list.

39:23.880 --> 39:24.835
-That's great.

39:24.840 --> 39:27.024
Listen, oh, you're not
going to believe this.

39:27.030 --> 39:29.533
My flight got cancelled.

39:29.540 --> 39:30.814
-Oh.

39:30.820 --> 39:32.492
Oh no.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.037
-Yeah, I'm stuck in a
Howard Johnson's in Boston.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.985
I'm so sorry.

39:36.990 --> 39:38.582
I wanted to bring you soup.

39:38.590 --> 39:40.148
-That's sweet.

39:40.150 --> 39:45.292
Well, don't worry about
it, I guess, get some rest.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.005
-I will.

39:46.010 --> 39:48.194
You, uh, you feel better, honey.

39:48.200 --> 39:53.001
-C|ark, um, everybody has been
talking about those murders.

39:55.660 --> 39:57.070
-Yep.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.457
-Agent Brooks says that
crime is at an all time high,

39:59.460 --> 40:02.907
and that it's only going
to get worse in DC.

40:02.910 --> 40:05.435
I think women should be
able to protect themselves.

40:05.440 --> 40:09.831
-Things like that
are really rare.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.353
-I'm gonna get a gun.

40:11.360 --> 40:12.440
-Martha.

40:12.450 --> 40:14.987
-C|ark, I don't
want to be a victim.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.346
-He||o, operator?

40:36.350 --> 40:39.217
Could I get the area code
for Cresson, Pennsylvania?

40:47.660 --> 40:49.480
Hi, I'm looking for
the phone number

40:49.490 --> 40:51.060
and address for Helen Leavis?

40:59.370 --> 41:02.009
-Hi, everybody, I'm home.

41:02.020 --> 41:02.975
Hi, honey.

41:02.980 --> 41:03.947
-Hi, Dad.

41:03.950 --> 41:06.248
-How are you?

41:06.250 --> 41:06.944
You OK?

41:06.950 --> 41:09.168
-You're home.

41:09.180 --> 41:11.580
-Yeah.

41:11.590 --> 41:14.639
Yeah, I, uh, heard
your voice on the phone

41:14.640 --> 41:16.267
so I thought I'd drive
straight through.

41:18.940 --> 41:19.895
-Night.

41:19.900 --> 41:20.594
-Goodnight.

41:27.320 --> 41:28.503
You OK?

41:28.510 --> 41:29.204
-Yeah.

42:11.690 --> 42:14.909
-What are you going
to tell the kids?

42:14.920 --> 42:15.614
-Lava.

42:21.350 --> 42:24.296
I signalled the Centre.

42:24.300 --> 42:26.325
It'll be tomorrow if
they want us to go.

42:33.650 --> 42:35.436
-I keep thinking
about their son.

42:42.060 --> 42:47.862
-I saw him walking back to
the room, when I was leaving.

42:47.870 --> 42:49.986
I heard him screaming.

42:53.780 --> 42:58.035
-What's going to
happen to him now?

42:58.040 --> 43:01.487
-The Centre will make
sure he's taken care of.

43:01.490 --> 43:02.479
-Taken care of how?

43:07.200 --> 43:07.894
-Yeah.

43:15.290 --> 43:19.920
-Phillip, all these
years, I-- I never

43:19.930 --> 43:24.446
worried about Paige
and Henry being safe.

43:27.420 --> 43:29.729
What happened to
Emmett and Leann,

43:29.730 --> 43:31.061
I always knew that was a risk.

43:35.070 --> 43:46.117
But seeing Amelia-- I mean, how
are we going to live like this?

43:48.950 --> 43:52.590
-We'll get used to it.

43:52.600 --> 43:54.636
Like we got used
to everything else.

44:00.060 --> 44:02.073
I can't believe I
pulled Henry into that.

44:02.080 --> 44:04.435
That I pulled him into this.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.458
-You didn't have a choice.

44:11.730 --> 44:14.142
-Yeah, I did.
