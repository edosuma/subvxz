Hey, baby.
What you hiding back there?

01:23.083 --> 01:26.042
Oh, you ain'’t ready. Okay.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.915
This right here
is an LED shower head.

01:29.959 --> 01:32.266
LED?
Like the lights?

01:32.309 --> 01:34.833
That thing changes colors

01:34.877 --> 01:36.922

Ain'’t nothing wrong with
a little color in your life.

01:40.187 --> 01:41.666
I think you'’ve been
working too hard.

01:41.710 --> 01:43.277
Well, there'’s a lot
of bad guys out there, Ma.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.279
Come on, let'’s
get you hooked up.

01:45.322 --> 01:48.456
Oh, Lord. Disco Inferno.

You know, Ma,
I think this is a problem

01:50.284 --> 01:53.069
with your shut-off valve,
not your shower head.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.984
So no laser shower?Oh, no. You
still getting

01:55.027 --> 01:56.116
your red light special.

01:56.159 --> 01:57.552
I just got to come
back with some parts

01:57.595 --> 01:59.641
and you get to see
a little more of me later.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.774
Why are you smiley this morning?

02:02.818 --> 02:04.124
W-What?Something eating at you?

02:04.167 --> 02:05.560
There'’s always something
eating at you

02:05.603 --> 02:07.953
when you smile this much.N-Nothing.

02:07.997 --> 02:09.955
Nothing, as far as I know.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.218
Mm-hmm.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.962
Get in there, Tan man!

02:17.006 --> 02:17.963
Get in there, Tan!

02:28.887 --> 02:30.324
Round goes to Stevens.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.456
Luca, get in!

02:34.197 --> 02:35.416
Here we go, Stevens.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.769
Push off the rope, Stevens.

02:44.468 --> 02:47.297
Oh!

02:47.341 --> 02:49.473
That'’s right!

02:49.517 --> 02:51.171
Special Agent Benson?

02:51.214 --> 02:52.694
Commander Hicks,
I assume.

02:52.737 --> 02:54.478
Okay, Captain Cortez and
one of our team leaders

02:54.522 --> 02:56.219
are waiting upstairs
as you requested.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.047
Perfect. This is
Agent Jorge Romero.

02:58.090 --> 03:00.354
I'’m with the PFM.
It'’s like the FBI, only...

03:00.397 --> 03:03.618
Mexican.
Happy to have you.

03:03.661 --> 03:05.010
BENSON:
See the LAPD was smart enough

03:05.054 --> 03:06.577
to put you in a
leadership role, Cortez.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.058
Well, we get it right
every now and then.

03:09.101 --> 03:12.061
Now, this woman was the backbone
of a sting that we ran in 2012.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.845
I did time undercover
when I worked gang unit.

03:13.889 --> 03:15.456
Got in pretty tight
with a crew called Los Huesos.

03:15.499 --> 03:16.674
Took down their
leadership,

03:16.718 --> 03:17.893
never blew her cover.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.024
That sounds about right.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.243
ROMERO:
Unfortunately,

03:20.287 --> 03:22.202
Los Huesos are back.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.465
They'’re shipping up low-grade
amphetamines from Mexico.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.728
Cheaper and stronger than
Adderall, and they'’re shopping

03:26.771 --> 03:29.383
them to high school and college
students as study drugs.

03:29.426 --> 03:30.688
We'’ve got about a
half-dozen kids dead

03:30.732 --> 03:32.473
from heart attacks already.

03:32.516 --> 03:33.822
He one of their heavies?No.

03:33.865 --> 03:34.823
No, this is one of ours.

03:34.866 --> 03:36.781
This is Special Agent
Adrian Cruz.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.043
He'’s been embedded
with Los Huesos in L.A.

03:38.087 --> 03:39.436
for about six months.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.177
No idea when Los Huesos
started to doubt his cover,

03:41.221 --> 03:42.787
but they must have been
following him.

03:42.831 --> 03:45.790
This morning, Cruz was
in the Palisades with his wife,

03:45.834 --> 03:47.705
nowhere near gang turf,
when they showed up

03:47.749 --> 03:49.620
out of the blue
and snatched him.

03:49.664 --> 03:52.536
Rico Peña, found
dead on the scene,

03:52.580 --> 03:55.147
and Eduardo "Flaco"
Ruiz, Top dog in L.A.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.540
Agent Cruz'’s wife says

03:56.584 --> 03:58.194
Flaco'’s the one
who took her husband.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.587
JESSICA:
I remember Rico.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.719
Never seen Flaco.
He must be new.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.330
He was sent up from
Mexico about a year ago.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.333
The man he answers to
down there, however--

04:06.376 --> 04:08.378
that may ring a bell.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.901
JESSICA:
Raul Lopez.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.034
Raul'’s in Mexico?He'’s based in Mexico City,

04:12.077 --> 04:13.644
but he runs L.A.

04:13.688 --> 04:15.646
ROMERO:
Raul did three years
for the sting Cortez ran.

04:15.690 --> 04:18.258
He moved his way up in prison,
then headed to Mexico

04:18.301 --> 04:20.085
as soon as he got out
and shot up the ranks.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.391
JESSICA:
That'’s a quick rise.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.175
Raul was low-level
when I worked him.

04:23.219 --> 04:25.395
Smart, but nothing close
to a leader.

04:25.439 --> 04:27.092
Easy to rise when
you take out

04:27.136 --> 04:28.703
the three guys ahead of you.

04:28.746 --> 04:31.401
He'’s not just smart,
he'’s ruthless.

04:31.445 --> 04:33.273
Nothing goes down in L.A.
without Raul signing off.

04:33.316 --> 04:35.405
He will know where Flaco
is keeping Cruz.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.928
Look, I don'’t want to say it,
but what makes you think

04:36.972 --> 04:38.669
he'’s still alive?He managed to dump

04:38.713 --> 04:40.715
his wallet and his phone,
so our best guess is Los Huesos

04:40.758 --> 04:42.107
don'’t know who he is yet.

04:42.151 --> 04:43.326
They'’re gonna press
the hell out of him

04:43.370 --> 04:44.675
to find out
who he'’s working for.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.024
BENSON:
Exactly. Now, Cruz
is an ex-Ranger,

04:46.068 --> 04:48.679
SERE-trained to
resist and survive,

04:48.723 --> 04:50.290
but the clock
is ticking.

04:50.333 --> 04:51.726
We need to know
where Raul is keeping him.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.031
HONDO:
So, what--

04:53.075 --> 04:55.730
you want Cortez to ask him?
In Mexico City?

04:55.773 --> 04:57.122
The Bureau'’s
already run it by

04:57.166 --> 04:58.689
your chief of police.

04:58.733 --> 04:59.908
If you sign off it,

04:59.951 --> 05:01.779
so will he.

05:01.823 --> 05:03.303
Wait, you'’re serious?

05:03.346 --> 05:06.480
You want her to go undercover
in gangland Mexico?

05:08.743 --> 05:10.527
No way.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.442
No way. This feels
way too rushed and sloppy.

05:12.486 --> 05:14.444
I'’m the best shot
Agent Cruz has.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.316
You'’d do the same in my shoes.Jessica,

05:16.359 --> 05:18.622
the FBI has a solid file
on these guys.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.624
We run their leads,
and then we track them locally.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.452
Raul'’s men
will cover their tracks.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.541
Fed'’s intel could be
useless by now.

05:24.585 --> 05:26.195
You think you'’re gonna
just show up in Mexico

05:26.238 --> 05:27.849
and get a confession
on a wink and a smile?

05:27.892 --> 05:31.156
I realize you don'’t know
my work in the field.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.723
I'’m not questioning your skills,

05:32.767 --> 05:35.900
but we are talking about
a high-risk op on foreign soil.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.338
You walk in there, I guarantee
you Raul is not gonna be

05:38.381 --> 05:40.383
the only lion in that den
that you have to worry about.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.472
I understand the risks.
It'’s been a few years,

05:42.516 --> 05:44.474
but I know exactly
what I'’m walking into.

05:44.518 --> 05:45.736
It'’s either that

05:45.780 --> 05:48.391
or do nothing
and let Agent Cruz die.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.524
At the very least, bring backup.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.047
Someone who'’s got your six.

05:52.090 --> 05:54.876
Someone you can read
without words, and vice versa.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.356
CHRIS:
I'’m in.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.009
Whatever you need.

05:58.053 --> 06:00.098
Things are a lot messier
down in Mexico.I get it.

06:00.142 --> 06:01.535
I'’m still in.HONDO:
I knew you would be,

06:01.578 --> 06:03.319
so I already
ran it up the chain.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.974
All right, listen up.
Raul knew Jessica as Alicia.

06:06.017 --> 06:08.455
Now, our story is the two of you
met in prison.

06:08.498 --> 06:11.458
Alicia did five years for the
same bust that put Raul away.

06:11.501 --> 06:12.850
What was I in for?Manslaughter.

06:12.894 --> 06:13.895
Caught your boyfriend
with another woman,

06:13.938 --> 06:14.983
and you made him pay.

06:15.026 --> 06:16.637
Sounds like he had it coming.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.595
Nice, so you were, like,
Jessica'’s prison muscle.

06:18.639 --> 06:20.205
Shouldn'’t we send a fed instead?

06:20.249 --> 06:22.338
Someone who'’s spent time
embedded with guys like this?

06:22.382 --> 06:24.384
You worried I can'’t do it?No, of course not.

06:24.427 --> 06:26.124
I'’m just wondering what
the safest option might be.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.344
I'’ll be fine.HONDO:
The rest of us

06:28.388 --> 06:29.954
are gonna track this crew
right here in L.A.

06:29.998 --> 06:31.608
Now, we rescue
Agent Cruz and then

06:31.652 --> 06:33.958
we get Chris and Jessica
on a plane and back home.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.525
I'’ll run known addresses
of Huesos members, see if we got

06:35.569 --> 06:37.135
anything in the system
the FBI doesn'’t have.

06:37.179 --> 06:38.876
I'’ll reach out to narcotics,
see what they have

06:38.920 --> 06:40.225
on the new drug
these guys are pushing.HONDO: Great.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.271
Luca, Street,
dig into arrest records.

06:42.314 --> 06:44.099
See if we got anyone in custody
we can lean on.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.796
All over it, boss.All right, let'’s get to it.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.319
Chris.

06:49.539 --> 06:51.367
Up here, Cortez is your captain,

06:51.411 --> 06:53.325
but down there, you'’re just two
cops doing whatever it takes

06:53.369 --> 06:54.762
to stay alive, you understand?

06:54.805 --> 06:56.024
And it'’s been a while
since she'’s been

06:56.067 --> 06:57.286
in the field.Exactly.

06:57.329 --> 06:59.157
I need you to stay sharp
for both of you.

06:59.201 --> 07:01.986
Don'’t worry, boss,
I... I got her back.I know you do.

07:03.292 --> 07:05.076
JESSICA:
Think of it this way:

07:05.120 --> 07:07.427
the less you know, the
less you can worry about.

07:07.470 --> 07:10.734
I don'’t know, Jess.
How dangerous is it?

07:10.778 --> 07:14.477
I'’ll let you know over a bottle
of wine when I get back.

07:14.521 --> 07:17.915
It'’s undercover work.
There'’s always risks,

07:17.959 --> 07:20.701
but I'’m a cop
and I'’m trained to handle it.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.573
I need to know
you'’re okay with it.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.749
Listen, you say
you got to do it, I'’m good.

07:25.793 --> 07:27.969
That doesn'’t mean it's fun
to be stuck outside the ropes

07:28.012 --> 07:30.537
when you-you can'’t even tell me
who you'’re in the ring fighting.

07:30.580 --> 07:33.278
I know. I'’m sorry.

07:33.322 --> 07:35.237
I knew I was in trouble
the second I met you.

07:36.325 --> 07:37.457
Just be safe.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.589
HONDO:
Captain.

07:39.633 --> 07:40.764
Hondo,

07:40.808 --> 07:42.505
this is David Arias.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.594
David, this is Hondo,
one of our SWAT team leaders.

07:44.638 --> 07:45.987
Pleasure to meet you, David.Nice to meet you.

07:46.030 --> 07:47.292
Just want to let you know
that Chris

07:47.336 --> 07:48.642
is all squared away
and ready to roll.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.121
Oh, so this Chris guy
is going with you?

07:50.165 --> 07:52.472
She is. Yes.Oh, sheis. Wow.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.604
I-I totally gender-assumed
there, didn'’t I?

07:54.648 --> 07:55.953
Don'’t even sweat it, man.Got to say,

07:55.997 --> 07:57.607
I got a lot of respect
for what you guys do.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.566
I appreciate that.
And Captain Cortez here

07:59.609 --> 08:00.610
is one of our best.

08:00.654 --> 08:02.438
I believe it.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.005
She'’s something else.Okay, guys.

08:04.048 --> 08:05.528
We'’re done here.
I have a plane to catch.

08:05.572 --> 08:07.138
Thank you, Hondo.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.668
ROMERO: You need to stay
on your toes down here.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.408
The narcos wield
a lot more power in Mexico

08:16.452 --> 08:18.193
than your gangs up north.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.586
And while most cops are clean,

08:19.629 --> 08:21.283
we have our share
of dirty ones.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.415
Best if no one knows
you'’re in town.

08:23.459 --> 08:26.549
Raul'’s hacienda is nearby.

08:26.593 --> 08:29.160
I have a good view.
If you leave his place,

08:29.204 --> 08:31.554
check in here
before going anywhere else.

08:31.598 --> 08:33.208
As long as
the mission is on,

08:33.251 --> 08:38.082
these curtains stay closed.

08:38.126 --> 08:40.258
If you see them open
it means either Agent Cruz

08:40.302 --> 08:42.696
has been rescued
or we'’ve aborted the mission.

08:42.739 --> 08:45.350
So if they'’re open, get out.

08:45.394 --> 08:48.049
Closed, stay put
and maintain your cover.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.833
Any way to signal
from inside Raul'’s hacienda

08:49.877 --> 08:51.400
in case things go south?

08:53.358 --> 08:55.317
No.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.840
Once you'’re in,
you'’re on your own.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.276
No weapons,

08:58.320 --> 09:01.758
no cell phones,
and a wire is too risky.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.804
Be careful in there.

09:03.847 --> 09:06.328
Raul has dropped
30 bodies at least,

09:06.371 --> 09:08.156
but we can'’t prove it
because we can'’t find them.

09:08.199 --> 09:11.333
If something goes wrong,
get out and run,

09:11.376 --> 09:13.596
and hope I get to you
before he does.

09:59.947 --> 10:02.253
Let me do the talking.

10:02.297 --> 10:03.603
Buenos días.

12:35.450 --> 12:37.017
We checked every hangout,
hideout and stash house

12:37.060 --> 12:38.670
Los Huesos have used
in the last six months

12:38.714 --> 12:40.411
and come up empty.
These guys have vanished.

12:40.455 --> 12:42.109
We'’ve also compiled a list
of the gang'’s friends,

12:42.152 --> 12:43.675
relatives, but if we talk
to them, we might

12:43.719 --> 12:45.329
tip off Los Huesos that
Agent Cruz is one of us.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.636
We can'’t risk that.I might have something.

12:47.679 --> 12:49.594
Hollywood Division Narcotics
says they'’ve been tracking

12:49.638 --> 12:51.509
a house with some frat types,
new on the scene,

12:51.553 --> 12:53.163
pushing volume of
a low-grade study drug

12:53.207 --> 12:55.383
they'’re calling Lucidia.That'’s the stuff.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.471
Los Huesos have
a few names for it,

12:56.514 --> 12:57.689
but Lucidia is one of them.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.169
If Hollywood'’s already
onto these guys,

12:59.213 --> 13:00.649
then it won'’t look fishy
if we kicked their doors in.

13:00.692 --> 13:01.955
Hell, the louder the better.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.218
We'’ll-we'll never
be able to sell all this.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.568
Okay, I can get Louie and
Chadsworth to move some.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.222
Maybe Benji.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.485
It'’s still too much,
bro. We can'’t.

13:10.528 --> 13:12.487
HONDO: On the ground!Whoa, don'’t shoot, don't shoot!

13:12.530 --> 13:15.011
On the ground! SWAT!On the ground! Hands
where I can see them.

13:15.055 --> 13:17.231
On the ground, right now!It'’s not ours. They came
and dumped it on us.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.754
Who did?Shut up, Ryan.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.843
We want lawyers.You tell me who brought you
these drugs,

13:20.887 --> 13:22.366
you won'’t need a lawyer,
you feel me?

13:22.410 --> 13:23.672
Any of you got the brains

13:23.715 --> 13:25.717
to avoid prison,
it'’s time to start talking.

13:28.590 --> 13:31.549
CHRIS: Your man Raul
is big on security.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.724
Just means we'’re safe.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.378
Safe?
You see the way his girl

13:34.422 --> 13:37.207
and his muscle
were eyeballing you?

13:37.251 --> 13:38.600
The sooner we get back home,
the better.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.254
I'’ll talk to him,
get things moving.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.054
Some things.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.607
Mm.

16:57.929 --> 16:59.366
Los Huesos probably
dumped their inventory,

16:59.409 --> 17:01.063
thinking with a rat
in the kitchen that

17:01.107 --> 17:03.022
their product was safer here
than one of their stash houses.

17:04.414 --> 17:06.025
HONDO:
We got a looky-loo who seems

17:06.068 --> 17:07.504
mighty interested
in what we'’re up to.

17:09.289 --> 17:11.030
Stop the car!

17:11.073 --> 17:12.683
Stop the car.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.076
Turn the car off,
step out slowly.

17:14.120 --> 17:15.338
Hands where I can see them.

17:20.517 --> 17:21.823
You watching all this
for a reason?

17:21.866 --> 17:23.564
Please just tell me
those punks are going away

17:23.607 --> 17:25.479
for a long, long time.Why?

17:25.522 --> 17:26.871
What'’s it to you?

17:26.915 --> 17:28.656
One of them killed my daughter

17:28.699 --> 17:31.093
with the drugs he sold her.
You wouldn'’t believe

17:31.137 --> 17:33.269
the pressure
kids are under these days.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.966
So she was taking something
to help her study?

17:35.010 --> 17:37.230
One of those idiots
sold her poison.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.232
Heart attack at 17.

17:39.275 --> 17:40.407
Sir, they will pay for it,

17:40.450 --> 17:42.017
but right now,
we also need to get the guys

17:42.061 --> 17:43.801
who are pumping the poison
into our country.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.760
The guys that are supplying
these losers.Yeah.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.327
They were here this morning.

17:47.370 --> 17:50.634
Latino guys. Unloaded a van
full of boxes and took off.

17:50.678 --> 17:52.332
Okay, wait a minute.
You saw them?

17:52.375 --> 17:54.160
Did you get a plate number?Dealer tags.

17:54.203 --> 17:57.032
But I followed them.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.643
They headed south and got off
the 710 at Del Amo.

17:59.687 --> 18:01.689
Headed into an area
that I couldn'’t follow

18:01.732 --> 18:03.647
in my Beemer,
if you know what I mean.We'’re gonna need

18:03.691 --> 18:06.476
a description of that van
and anyone you saw in it.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.435
JESSICA:
We need to get word
back to L.A.

18:08.478 --> 18:10.045
that agent Cruz is alive

18:10.089 --> 18:12.134
and Raul still doesn'’t
know who he is.

18:12.178 --> 18:14.180
Sorry for pressing him
like that.

18:14.223 --> 18:15.616
Raul can be sensitive.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.313
Best to let Alicia handle him.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.141
She'’s quite
the firecracker, Alicia.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.621
You like her?

18:20.664 --> 18:22.362
I do. Certainly a side
I didn'’t see coming.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.625
JESSICA:
Curtain'’s closed.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.366
Let'’s go up.

18:26.409 --> 18:29.151
ROMERO:
Good to hear that Agent Cruz
is still alive,

18:29.195 --> 18:31.022
but this Chato thing
is a problem.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.503
Raul won'’t just kill him,
he'’ll make a show of it

18:33.547 --> 18:35.026
to set an example.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.550
What if we say
we can'’t find him?

18:36.593 --> 18:38.639
We can'’t go back empty-handed.

18:38.682 --> 18:40.902
That won'’t fly with Raul.
Like he said, it'’s a test.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.687
If you think it'’s too
risky, don'’t do it.

18:43.731 --> 18:46.386
I know how serious
you take a missing cop,

18:46.429 --> 18:48.518
but losing two more in Mexico
won'’t make it any better.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.086
What if we kill him?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.696
Raul?

18:52.740 --> 18:55.134
No. Chato.

19:04.186 --> 19:05.622
D.A.'’s been leaning on the
frat kids, but they don'’t

19:05.666 --> 19:07.058
seem to know much.
What do we have on that van?

19:07.102 --> 19:08.756
Grieving father saw the van
exit a freeway

19:08.799 --> 19:10.236
near Rancho Dominquez.

19:10.279 --> 19:11.585
That'’s out of the way
and a good spot to lay low.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.761
Central Vice has some
UCs keeping eyes out,

19:13.804 --> 19:14.892
but that'’s a lot of
ground to canvass

19:14.936 --> 19:15.980
without drawing attention.

19:16.024 --> 19:17.634
And with Chris
and Cortez embedded,

19:17.678 --> 19:19.201
the last thing we want
is to tip Los Huesos

19:19.245 --> 19:20.420
that we'’re looking for them.

19:20.463 --> 19:22.030
Just got word from Romero.

19:22.073 --> 19:24.075
Your officers have confirmed
that Cruz is still alive

19:24.119 --> 19:26.643
and Los Huesos have
no idea who he is yet.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.254
Great, so we
bringing them home?Well, not yet.

19:28.297 --> 19:30.212
Raul has sent them
on some kind of a task.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.866
Says if they prove themselves

19:31.909 --> 19:33.563
he'’ll let them in on the whole
L.A. operation.

19:33.607 --> 19:35.696
What kind of task?I...

19:35.739 --> 19:37.654
STREET:
But they'’ve confirmed
that Cruz is still alive,

19:37.698 --> 19:39.743
and we know the part of town
that he'’s probably being held.

19:39.787 --> 19:41.876
I mean, is it really worth the
risk of leaving them down there?

19:41.919 --> 19:43.443
HONDO:
All right, look, we all
want to bring them back

19:43.486 --> 19:45.096
as soon as possible,
but Benson'’s right.

19:45.140 --> 19:46.881
We pull them out now,
it could look suspicious.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.622
They maintain their covers
until we get Agent Cruz back.

19:48.665 --> 19:49.971
End of story.

19:50.014 --> 19:52.016
Yes, sir.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.676
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.678
It'’s okay, it's okay.That'’s it.
Hey. That'’s it.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.512
30 seconds.

20:48.595 --> 20:51.293
What happened?
You shoot him for real?

20:51.337 --> 20:52.729
CHRIS:
He tried to run
at the last minute.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.427
I had to get a little physical.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.958
ROMERO:
I'’ll have someone come get him.

21:04.001 --> 21:07.266
I hope you two know
what you'’re doing.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.490
David Arias.
Yeah.

21:14.534 --> 21:17.101
Yeah, yeah, he'’s good.
Send him back.

21:17.145 --> 21:18.668
You good, Street?

21:18.712 --> 21:20.409
You got any idea
how many cops

21:20.453 --> 21:21.976
have been killed in
Mexico this year alone?

21:22.019 --> 21:23.325
I don'’t think
that'’s something

21:23.369 --> 21:24.848
you need to be focused
on right now.

21:24.892 --> 21:27.024
I just, I hate the feeling
like we got family

21:27.068 --> 21:28.591
in the battlefield,
and there'’s not a damn thing

21:28.635 --> 21:30.201
that we can do to help.Hey.

21:30.245 --> 21:33.335
We are helping. We have UCs
combing the streets,

21:33.379 --> 21:34.858
we have every CI in town
getting grilled,

21:34.902 --> 21:37.426
and once we even get a whiff
of intel, it'’s game on.

21:37.470 --> 21:40.473
And I'’m gonna need everyone
to be razor sharp and rested.

21:40.516 --> 21:42.953
I don'’t know, it's just
like, give me a job to do?

21:42.997 --> 21:44.781
I don'’t care how dangerous
it is, I'’ll get it done.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.435
But this sitting
on our hands crap...

21:46.479 --> 21:47.915
It'’s real easy to get lost

21:47.958 --> 21:49.569
with the things
that you can'’t control.

21:49.612 --> 21:51.440
But we know that Chris
and Jessica are safe

21:51.484 --> 21:53.529
at the moment,
and they have the trust of Raul.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.097
They'’re gonna send us some intel
soon, so I'’m gonna need you

21:56.140 --> 21:57.533
to find something else
to focus on,

21:57.577 --> 21:58.926
something to keep you positive.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.231
All right.DAVID:
Hondo.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.582
David.

22:02.625 --> 22:04.105
Hey. Everything all right?

22:04.148 --> 22:05.628
Yeah, yeah. Thanks.I got it.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.151
Thanks for letting me drop in.
I just,

22:07.195 --> 22:08.718
I just can'’t figure out
what to do with myself.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.241
Look, I'’m not the prying type,

22:10.285 --> 22:11.982
but it'’s hard to feel
so far out of the loop.

22:12.026 --> 22:13.941
Know the feeling.

22:15.377 --> 22:17.336
I'’m going for a run.

22:17.379 --> 22:19.468
I guess I was just hoping
you could tell me

22:19.512 --> 22:21.905
if you'’ve heard from her.She sent a message to us.

22:21.949 --> 22:23.429
It sounds like everything
is going as planned.

22:23.472 --> 22:26.083
Man, I don'’t know
why I'’m so wound up.

22:26.127 --> 22:27.781
Well, dating a cop'’s never
an easy thing.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.044
You ever date anyone
on the force?

22:31.132 --> 22:32.742
Couple times.

22:32.786 --> 22:34.265
At least as a cop,
you know you measure up well.

22:34.309 --> 22:35.789
Hey, come on, man.
I don'’t think you have

22:35.832 --> 22:37.747
to worry about all that.Well, usually,
I don'’t,

22:37.791 --> 22:39.575
but Jessica'’s different, man.

22:39.619 --> 22:41.925
Look, I know it sucks
being left in the dark,

22:41.969 --> 22:44.101
but she will be home
before you know it.

22:45.668 --> 22:48.367
Thank you, man.
Yeah.

22:54.329 --> 22:55.896
CHARICE:
You realize

22:55.939 --> 22:57.114
it'’s past midnight?

22:57.158 --> 22:58.507
Mama, by morning,

22:58.551 --> 23:00.291
this is all gonna be
good as new.

23:00.335 --> 23:02.990
So, you want to tell me
what'’s going on at work,

23:03.033 --> 23:04.905
or is this
something else?

23:04.948 --> 23:06.515
You only start

23:06.559 --> 23:08.125
these little projects
when you'’re spinning

23:08.169 --> 23:10.040
and need to feel
like you can fix something.

23:10.084 --> 23:11.694
I don'’t know, I...

23:11.738 --> 23:14.523
I'’m just restless, that's all.

23:14.567 --> 23:17.570
Are you still seeing
that girl, the ADA?

23:17.613 --> 23:21.661
No. No, that, uh, that
kind of went south.

23:21.704 --> 23:23.402
But it was never really
a permanent thing, anyway.

23:23.445 --> 23:24.794
Are they ever?

23:24.838 --> 23:26.230
Well, what'’s that
supposed to mean?

23:26.274 --> 23:27.797
Well, it'’s just that, sometimes,

23:27.841 --> 23:30.191
I feel like
I'’ve raised you to be

23:30.234 --> 23:32.280
a little bit too independent.Okay, Mama,

23:32.323 --> 23:34.543
I don'’t think girl trouble's
what'’s messing with me.

23:34.587 --> 23:36.415
Well, you spinning
about something.

23:38.547 --> 23:41.942
All right, I...

23:41.985 --> 23:44.771
I just feel like
I can never do enough,

23:44.814 --> 23:46.642
like nothing ever changes.

23:46.686 --> 23:48.644
Some of it won'’t.

23:48.688 --> 23:50.603
There'’s always gonna be
another racist cop

23:50.646 --> 23:52.692
like that one in Arizona.

23:52.735 --> 23:56.043
A pervert like the one
that went after your sister.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.654
Never gonna
get '’em all,

23:58.698 --> 24:01.788
but big picture, things change.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.660
Do they?I'’ve been around
long enough to see it.

24:04.704 --> 24:07.837
When I was a little girl,
I never saw anyone

24:07.881 --> 24:10.623
that looked like you
wearing a gun and a badge.

24:12.233 --> 24:14.714
I hear you, Ma...

24:14.757 --> 24:17.499
I just want to know that
I'’m making a real difference.

24:17.543 --> 24:20.894
Oh, you are, baby. You are.

24:20.937 --> 24:24.375
You got to start
trying to look at things

24:24.419 --> 24:26.029
the way you look at that faucet.

24:26.073 --> 24:28.379
You ain'’t gonna fix
the world'’s plumbing problems,

24:28.423 --> 24:31.905
but I'’m sure gonna be smiling
when you fix mine.

24:31.948 --> 24:33.994
You know you'’re over here
sounding like Oprah,

24:34.037 --> 24:35.386
trying to fix my life.

24:35.430 --> 24:36.692
I wish I had some
of that Oprah money

24:36.736 --> 24:39.216
for schooling
your little butt.

24:39.260 --> 24:42.045
Oh...

24:42.089 --> 24:44.439
Just focus on what'’s
in front of you, baby.

24:44.483 --> 24:47.137
That'’s all you can control.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.750
And by that,

24:50.793 --> 24:52.621
I mean my shower.

24:52.665 --> 24:54.101
Yes, ma'’am. Yes, ma'am.

24:54.144 --> 24:56.495
I'’m on it. I'm on it.

25:28.875 --> 25:30.790
CHATO:
Huh?

25:53.508 --> 25:55.031
Raul.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.303
No.

27:00.749 --> 27:02.011
Hmm.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.363
If Raul believed
the video they made,

27:49.406 --> 27:53.672
the intel should be legit.
If he didn'’t, who knows?

27:53.715 --> 27:55.282
Is there any way
to contact them and verify?

27:55.325 --> 27:58.589
Unfortunately, no. All I can do
is give the signal to pull out.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.200
Came as soon as I could.Whoa.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.289
You always look this
sharp at 3:00 a.m.?No.

28:02.332 --> 28:04.770
Hondo'’s boy Dee's got me loaded
up with shifts at the club.

28:04.813 --> 28:07.163
Baby coming, need money.
Where are we at?

28:07.207 --> 28:09.209
The rest of the team plus
Benitez are en route.

28:09.252 --> 28:11.777
Now, Street got a text message
with an address for Flaco,

28:11.820 --> 28:14.083
except it'’s nowhere near
where the father saw the van.

28:14.127 --> 28:15.737
Where'’s the address?Silver Lake.

28:15.781 --> 28:17.913
Anything else? Who sent it?It'’s a burner phone in Mexico.

28:17.957 --> 28:20.699
It said not to text back.
I'’m guessing it's Chris.

28:20.742 --> 28:22.570
Couldn'’t it have also been
Raul trying to set a trap?

28:22.613 --> 28:24.354
If he'’s suspicious,
he sends us bunk intel,

28:24.398 --> 28:26.095
see if we bite.How would he get my number?

28:26.139 --> 28:28.054
Well, for right now, we have to
assume that that intel is legit.

28:28.097 --> 28:30.099
We just can'’t take any of it
for granted.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.492
DEACON: Well, Silver Lake'’s
not the smartest place
to torture a prisoner.

28:31.535 --> 28:33.189
A lot of nosy neighbors.

28:33.233 --> 28:35.104
No, but it'’s a great spot for
an inked-up banger to disappear.

28:35.148 --> 28:36.802
He can blend right in
with the hipsters.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.847
If you raid the place
and Agent Cruz isn'’t there,

28:38.891 --> 28:41.763
Raul will hear about it.
Won'’t be good for your friends.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.634
He'’s right. We need more info.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.506
We got to get eyes and ears in
there without getting spotted.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.637
I'’ll get Agent Benson cracking

28:46.681 --> 28:47.769
on a federal
surveillance warrant.

28:47.813 --> 28:48.944
See if her guys
can get that house rigged

28:48.988 --> 28:50.032
before the sun comes up.

29:16.015 --> 29:19.801
Let'’s hope the address you sent
Street was worth something.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.281
Either way, we'’re on
that plane tomorrow,

29:21.324 --> 29:23.674
unless you want to end up
in bed with that psycho.

29:23.718 --> 29:26.982
JESSICA:
I can get more out of him first.

29:27.026 --> 29:29.768
I'’ll keep an eye on Meathead
and the girlfriend for you.

29:32.553 --> 29:35.643
They'’d both throw you off
this roof if they could.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.558
Nice work with the cameras.BENSON: We'’re lucky
their air vents

29:37.601 --> 29:39.821
could fit our drones. We got
'’em in just before sunrise.

29:39.865 --> 29:42.476
Let'’s hope we get
something from it.

29:42.519 --> 29:43.825
All right, here we go.
Flaco'’s back.

29:58.057 --> 30:00.146
They got Agent Cruz
in a matadero.

30:00.189 --> 30:01.843
It'’s like a slaughterhouse
or meat factory,

30:01.887 --> 30:03.192
about 30 kilometers
from where they'’re at.

30:03.236 --> 30:04.541
That'’s like 20 miles, right?Yeah.

30:04.585 --> 30:05.716
Street, how far
is that Silver Lake house

30:05.760 --> 30:07.414
from the van sighting?

30:07.457 --> 30:09.851
He said if Cruz doesn'’t
talk soon, they'’ll kill him.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.853
19 miles. It'’s got to be
somewhere close to there.

30:11.897 --> 30:14.203
Search the area
for slaughterhouses.

30:14.247 --> 30:15.422
Okay.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.076
Delamo Meat Company.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.860
Looks like the health department
shut '’em down a year ago.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.906
They'’ve been
off-line ever since.Can you get a schematic?

30:20.949 --> 30:22.559
Something that shows
a layout of the place?

30:22.603 --> 30:24.344
Should be able to.BENSON:
Makes sense.

30:24.387 --> 30:25.867
Two of the stash houses
they cleared out

30:25.911 --> 30:27.390
are just a couple
of blocks away from there.

30:27.434 --> 30:29.392
BENI: Lot of ins and outs.LUCA: Plenty of places to hide.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.917
STREET: And they'’ll be on
the doors. If we go in too hot,

30:31.960 --> 30:33.875
they could take Cruz out
before we can get to him.

30:33.919 --> 30:37.270
We breach from the roof.
Get a drop on '’em.

30:37.313 --> 30:39.707
I'’ll have Mumford and
Stevens'’ teams set a net.

30:39.750 --> 30:41.491
Your team runs breach
and recovery.

30:41.535 --> 30:43.580
Let'’s go get Agent Cruz out of
there and get our people back.

30:43.624 --> 30:45.147
Let'’s move.

32:28.859 --> 32:30.687
Just before a man dies,

32:30.731 --> 32:32.298
his pride vanishes.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.998
Then he stops fighting

32:37.042 --> 32:39.131
for the silly things
he believes in.

32:44.658 --> 32:45.876
I think...

32:45.920 --> 32:49.532
I think we'’re
getting close.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.627
Drop it! Down!

33:40.670 --> 33:42.020
Down on your knees!

33:42.063 --> 33:43.456
Down! Down!Put your hands behind your back!

33:43.499 --> 33:45.893
Your hands behind your back!
Both hands!
Now! Now!

33:45.936 --> 33:47.155
LAPD SWAT!

33:48.200 --> 33:52.465
Street, I got him.
Check on Cruz.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.037
Stay down!

33:59.080 --> 34:00.777
Stay down!
You'’re done!

34:00.821 --> 34:02.040
STREET:
Can you open your eyes?

34:02.083 --> 34:04.042
I got you now.

34:04.085 --> 34:05.130
I didn'’t talk.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.870
Yeah, you did good.
You did real good.

34:08.698 --> 34:11.310
This is 20-David.
We recovered Agent Cruz

34:11.353 --> 34:13.486
and I got Flaco in custody.
Are you good?

34:13.529 --> 34:14.748
One suspect down,
two in custody.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.184
We'’re good.All right, let'’s get word

34:16.228 --> 34:18.012
down to Mexico and get them
the hell out of there.

34:20.623 --> 34:23.104
Paco'’s been on and off his phone
for the last ten minutes.

34:23.148 --> 34:24.714
Now he'’s got blood
in his eyes.

34:24.758 --> 34:27.195
I think we'’re blown.

34:29.850 --> 34:32.853
All right.
Follow me and look casual.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.246
Yeah.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.626
Boss.

35:24.818 --> 35:26.428
If we go back out
there, we'’re dead.

35:26.472 --> 35:28.256
Where'’d you get that?Swiped it.

35:31.259 --> 35:33.131
Let'’s go. Come on.

36:06.990 --> 36:09.079
Señora, señora.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.885
Romero'’s on his way.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.301
Take the guard out,
then Raul,

36:56.344 --> 36:57.519
and I'’ll take Paco.

37:12.273 --> 37:14.362
How you like my pretty face now?

37:14.406 --> 37:15.624
Huh?

37:50.137 --> 37:52.400
Ready to go back home?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.503
Here they are!

38:08.547 --> 38:10.200
Yeah!
Welcome back.

38:10.244 --> 38:11.593
So good to be here.

38:13.987 --> 38:16.163
Hell no. Get in here.Aw, you missed me or something?

38:16.206 --> 38:17.773
: Yeah.How'’d it go down there?

38:17.817 --> 38:19.645
Tell you what, my partner Alicia
was a badass.

38:19.688 --> 38:21.777
Too bad you guys didn'’t get
a chance to meet her.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.565
Damn, I think we just did.

38:26.608 --> 38:30.482
You know, before we left,
I promised Hondo that

38:30.525 --> 38:31.744
I would have your back,

38:31.787 --> 38:33.006
but I think you'’re the one
that had mine.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.356
I say we had each other'’s.

38:35.400 --> 38:36.879
The way it'’s supposed
to work, right?

38:36.923 --> 38:39.186
I always respected the hell
out of you as a captain.

38:39.229 --> 38:41.667
I just had no idea what
an incredible cop you are, too.

38:41.710 --> 38:44.887
One of my better kept secrets.DEACON: Not anymore.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.802
Captain Cortez.

38:46.846 --> 38:48.064
Agent Benson.

38:48.108 --> 38:49.936
Agent Romero wanted me
to let you know,

38:49.979 --> 38:51.503
they found the chemical plant
that Raul'’s been using

38:51.546 --> 38:53.069
to dispose of the bodies.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.898
They'’re sweeping for DNA.
He'’s going down for good.

38:55.942 --> 38:57.509
That'’s great news. Thank you.

38:57.552 --> 38:59.511
Sounds like things got a little
thick down there at the end.

38:59.554 --> 39:01.121
Nothing we couldn'’t handle.

39:01.164 --> 39:04.472
Well, in any case,
we owe you big.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.127
HICKS:
Now for the fun part,

39:07.170 --> 39:09.172
interagency paperwork.

39:09.216 --> 39:11.174
Well, I can hardly wait.

39:12.959 --> 39:16.484
Ah, I guess all that worrying we
were doing was for nothing, huh?

39:16.528 --> 39:18.443
You probably burned
a few calories.

39:18.486 --> 39:20.183
Hmm. Okay,
there was that.

39:20.227 --> 39:23.273
Either way, I'’m just
really glad you'’re okay.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.710
Thank you.

39:29.192 --> 39:31.107
See you tomorrow.

39:33.327 --> 39:35.242
Hey.

40:04.140 --> 40:08.449
Hmm. You feel better, baby?

40:08.493 --> 40:10.582
I'’m too tired
to tell you right now.

40:10.625 --> 40:13.454
Aw. You should'’ve
just gone

40:13.498 --> 40:16.718
straight home and gone to sleep.
My shower could wait.

40:16.762 --> 40:20.635
You know me better than that.I guess I do.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.289
My Hon-do-it boy.

40:22.332 --> 40:23.769
Oh, come on,
Mama, don'’t do it.

40:23.812 --> 40:26.598
Practically the first
words out of your mouth.

40:26.641 --> 40:30.428
I loved how you just couldn'’t
manage saying "Hondo do it."

40:30.471 --> 40:31.994
It just was "Hon-do-it,"

40:32.038 --> 40:34.388
and wouldn'’t let nobody
help you with nothing.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.042
"Let me help you with
your shoes, baby."

40:36.085 --> 40:37.565
"No, Hon-do-it."

40:37.609 --> 40:39.524
"Let me help you with..."
"No, Hon-do-it."

40:41.134 --> 40:44.050
Hon-do-it. I was one proud
little man, wasn'’t I?

40:44.093 --> 40:47.488
Was? I don'’t remember
when that changed.

40:47.532 --> 40:50.230
And I encouraged it.

40:50.273 --> 40:51.753
That strength,

40:51.797 --> 40:55.235
that self-reliance
set you apart.

40:55.278 --> 40:58.412
It kept you safe
from temptation.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.153
Got you where you are.

41:00.196 --> 41:04.462
The irony is, it might be the
thing that'’s holding you back.

41:05.593 --> 41:07.552
Yeah, maybe.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.164
You know, Ma.

41:12.948 --> 41:17.475
I don'’t know if it's
because... I'’m alone

41:17.518 --> 41:20.695
or because I'’m
getting older or...

41:20.739 --> 41:22.958
if it'’s a cop thing
or if it'’s a black thing or...

41:23.002 --> 41:24.743
I mean, but whatever
it is, I mean,

41:24.786 --> 41:26.745
I-I don'’t feel right
complaining about it.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.137
Hmm.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.575
I know that I am blessed.

41:30.618 --> 41:32.272
I got so much more going for me

41:32.315 --> 41:34.187
than most of the people
I came up with.

41:34.230 --> 41:35.405
True enough.

41:35.449 --> 41:38.104
But everything comes
with a price, right?

41:38.147 --> 41:39.975
And what'’s the point

41:40.019 --> 41:42.978
of being the king if you'’re
gonna be alone in the castle?

41:46.895 --> 41:48.331
But I still got
you, don'’t I?

41:48.375 --> 41:50.943
Oh, Mama'’s love doesn't count.

41:50.986 --> 41:54.555
It'’s too blind, and I'm
not gonna be here forever.

41:54.599 --> 41:55.861
Yeah, well,
for a blind lady,

41:55.904 --> 41:57.906
you sure are picking up
on a lot of flaws.

41:57.950 --> 42:02.520
Not flaws,
just bumps in the road.

42:04.347 --> 42:06.915
I just wish I knew
what was causing '’em.

42:06.959 --> 42:09.135
You'’ll figure it out.

42:09.178 --> 42:11.964
Maybe not on your own.

42:12.007 --> 42:15.445
There'’s a lot of people who'd be
happy to help you over '’em,

42:15.489 --> 42:16.882
when you'’re ready.

42:20.146 --> 42:22.017
I love you.
