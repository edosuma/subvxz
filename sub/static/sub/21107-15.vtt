09:47.487 --> 09:49.554
(ECHOING) <i>Super cool.</i>

09:50.690 --> 09:52.190
<i>Okay, great. I like that.</i>

09:52.192 --> 09:53.291
<i>Hope you all heard that.</i>

09:53.293 --> 09:55.860
<i>Lockdown is over!</i>
<i>Have a bad night!</i>

09:55.862 --> 09:58.463
You never want to go
to war with the humans!

09:58.465 --> 10:01.866
Remember, when one ate my
Butterscream birthday cake

10:01.868 --> 10:03.335
and you said to forgive them.

10:03.337 --> 10:06.438
<i>Actually, I've been</i>
<i>meaning to tell you.</i>

10:06.440 --> 10:07.872
<i>I ate it.</i>

10:07.874 --> 10:08.873
<i>Yes. Me. Sorry.</i>

10:08.875 --> 10:11.743
<i>If it's any consolation,</i>
<i>though, it tasted great.</i>

10:11.745 --> 10:14.446
(SCREAMING)

10:14.448 --> 10:16.014
QUASIMODO: <i>En garde!</i>

10:16.016 --> 10:18.216
War!

10:21.087 --> 10:23.288
Uh. No war?

10:23.290 --> 10:25.156
<i>Oh, c'est bon.</i>

10:27.259 --> 10:32.964
DRACULA: <i>Mavey, I'm sorry</i>
<i>for pressuring you</i>
<i>to wear those wings.</i>

10:32.966 --> 10:35.533
<i>Perhaps they were a bit much!</i>

10:35.535 --> 10:37.302
And I'm sorry for
almost starting a war

10:37.304 --> 10:40.772
'cause I couldn't
tell you the truth about
those ugly, awkward,

10:40.774 --> 10:42.507
uncomfortable, ugly again...

10:42.509 --> 10:43.074
<i>Okay, I... I get it!</i>

10:43.076 --> 10:47.646
<i>Honeyguts, never forget</i>
<i>that we can always</i>
<i>talk to each other</i>

10:47.648 --> 10:50.849
<i>about anything,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

10:50.851 --> 10:52.951
(CHUCKLING) Yeah, I know.

10:52.953 --> 10:55.654
That's what makes
you super cool!

10:55.656 --> 10:56.921
<i>I'm glad you think that</i>

10:56.923 --> 11:00.592
<i>because there might be</i>
<i>another Mavey-Wavey product</i>

11:00.594 --> 11:03.561
<i>coming out really soon.</i>
<i>Okay, bye! Love you!</i>

11:03.563 --> 11:05.463
Wait, what?

11:06.632 --> 11:07.999
"The Mavey Savey?"

11:08.001 --> 11:11.302
It makes swimming pool
safety cool.

11:11.304 --> 11:14.105
(ECHOES) Super cool.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.941
(LAUGHING)

11:16.943 --> 11:20.545
(GROANING) Thanks, Dad.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.548
(BATS SQUEAKING)

11:23.550 --> 11:26.084
(WOLF HOWLING)

11:26.986 --> 11:27.552
PEDRO: Nice.

11:27.554 --> 11:30.922
You playing pin the stake
on the vampire again?

11:30.924 --> 11:32.223
Wait. You play that?

11:32.225 --> 11:33.625
Never.
Definitely, not.

11:33.627 --> 11:34.259
'Course.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.327
This is my body part
family tree!

11:36.329 --> 11:37.896
You guys know all
about your history,

11:37.898 --> 11:39.998
I wanna know where
my parts are from.

11:40.000 --> 11:40.799
Whoa!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.000
<i>You're part Werewolf?</i>

11:42.002 --> 11:44.102
HANK: <i>Yep.</i>
<i>My right-elbow part!</i>

11:44.104 --> 11:45.704
<i>My nose is from a Swamp Thing,</i>

11:45.706 --> 11:48.506
<i>and my kidneys are</i>
<i>from an invisible.</i>

11:48.508 --> 11:49.474
I mean, I hope.

11:49.476 --> 11:51.576
Cool. Where's this from?
HANK: The mail.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.345
<i>I couldn't figure out where</i>
<i>my left thumb came from,</i>

11:54.347 --> 11:56.514
so I sent away for
a home DNA test,

11:56.516 --> 11:58.616
but I'm too nervous
to open it.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.119
Your thumb's
from a troll, dude. 100%.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.687
Uh-uh. Chupacabra.
No doubt.

12:02.689 --> 12:05.690
I can't take the suspense.
Open it!

12:07.159 --> 12:08.460
What is it? How bad?

12:08.462 --> 12:11.362
Ow. Really bad. Paper cut.

12:11.364 --> 12:12.464
(ALL GASPING)

12:12.466 --> 12:13.998
Drumroll, please.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.667
My thumb is...

12:15.669 --> 12:18.002
Eh, um, vampire?

12:18.004 --> 12:21.072
"From a member
of the Dracula clan

12:21.074 --> 12:23.274
"dating back
thousands of years!"

12:23.276 --> 12:24.642
Holy rabies!

12:24.644 --> 12:25.777
We're related?

12:25.779 --> 12:28.213
Dude, you're part Dracula!

12:28.215 --> 12:29.380
Whoa, cool!

12:29.382 --> 12:31.549
Totally see the resemblance.

12:33.786 --> 12:34.886
Aren't you gonna eat?

12:34.888 --> 12:38.857
Second breakfast
is the fourth most
important meal of the day.

12:38.859 --> 12:41.493
Uh, I'm part vampire,
remember?

12:41.495 --> 12:42.227
Don't need to eat.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.763
Well, I think Mavis
would disagree.

12:44.765 --> 12:45.830
(GROWLING)

12:45.832 --> 12:47.465
(SLURPING)

12:47.467 --> 12:49.868
Vampires do need to eat, Hank.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.870
And, it's your thumb

12:51.872 --> 12:53.271
with a little cape on it.

12:53.273 --> 12:54.973
I know. Look how
good he looks.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.275
AUNT LYDIA: What is
this abhorrent nonsense I hear

12:57.277 --> 13:00.278
about Hank Stein
being part Dracula?

13:00.280 --> 13:04.149
I should put you in stocks
for just suggesting
such a thing.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.351
The certificate.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.620
Mmm-hmm.

13:08.622 --> 13:09.621
(CLUCKING)

13:09.623 --> 13:11.356
Pretty neat, huh?

13:11.358 --> 13:12.290
Oh!

13:12.292 --> 13:15.059
Oh! I would bet my afterlife

13:15.061 --> 13:18.496
this thumb belonged
to the late, great

13:18.498 --> 13:19.931
Lycidias Dracula.

13:19.933 --> 13:23.635
The last of the truly
horrifying Draculas.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.938
His depravity made us
a household name.

13:26.940 --> 13:31.543
<i>He was so feared,</i>
<i>his cows milked themselves</i>

13:31.545 --> 13:32.844
<i>at the mere mention of him.</i>

13:32.846 --> 13:34.212
MAN:
(WHISPERS) <i>Lycidias.</i>

13:34.214 --> 13:35.947
(COWS MOOING)

13:35.949 --> 13:36.915
PEDRO: <i>Wow, dude.</i>

13:36.917 --> 13:38.983
That is some lazy farming.

13:38.985 --> 13:40.618
Lycidias wasn't a farmer!

13:40.620 --> 13:42.420
He was my mentor.

13:42.422 --> 13:46.224
He taught me the fine art
of maniacal laughter.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.359
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

13:49.295 --> 13:52.597
Lycidias was an insidious
creature of the night.

13:52.599 --> 13:53.932
Who had cows.

13:53.934 --> 13:56.601
It was 3,000 years ago,

13:56.603 --> 13:58.636
everyone had cows!

13:58.638 --> 13:59.904
I did not know that!

13:59.906 --> 14:02.941
Mavis, you will train
your new cousin

14:02.943 --> 14:04.275
in the ways of the vampire.

14:04.277 --> 14:08.313
Until next time,
thumb of Lycidias.

14:09.081 --> 14:09.714
Did you hear that?

14:09.716 --> 14:12.584
I guess your Aunt Lydia
is my Aunt Lydia, too!

14:12.586 --> 14:16.020
Ooh! We're officially
blood relatives!

14:16.022 --> 14:16.354
Oh, shh!

14:16.356 --> 14:19.324
Don't mention blood
or my thumb might get hungry.

14:19.326 --> 14:21.059
(SNIFFING)

14:21.061 --> 14:25.296
Don't look at me.
I'm made of pure joy.

14:25.431 --> 14:29.267
There are several
rules of thumb
for being a vampire.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.537
First, we don't drink
blood anymore. Uh-uh.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.241
Vampires drink "I Can't
Believe It's Not Hemoglobin."

14:36.243 --> 14:40.111
It looks, tastes
and stains just like
the real thing!

14:40.113 --> 14:44.148
O-negative, now sold in
a scab-free spray bottle!

14:44.150 --> 14:45.516
Um, who are you talking to?

14:45.518 --> 14:49.220
One day, an invisible talent
scout is gonna be watching,

14:49.222 --> 14:50.221
and I'll be ready!

14:50.223 --> 14:53.458
There's so much
I can learn from you, Mavis.

14:53.659 --> 14:57.161
I might need that scab-free
spray bottle.

14:57.163 --> 14:58.229
MAVIS: Lesson two.

14:58.231 --> 14:59.764
If you're gonna be a Dracula,

14:59.766 --> 15:02.367
you gotta sound
like a Dracula.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.435
Ready? Bleh-bleh-bleh!

15:04.437 --> 15:05.403
Bleh-bleh-bleh!

15:05.405 --> 15:08.139
I don't say
"bleh-bleh-bleh!"

15:08.141 --> 15:10.308
Thirdly, you've gotta bat out.

15:10.310 --> 15:14.646
Close your eyes,
think flappy thoughts, and...

15:19.852 --> 15:20.919
Ahhh!

15:20.921 --> 15:22.787
How do you steer it?

15:22.789 --> 15:23.988
Whoa!

15:23.990 --> 15:25.657
(CLATTERING)

15:25.659 --> 15:27.425
Okay. Sorry!

15:28.961 --> 15:29.961
Ow!

15:29.963 --> 15:31.095
(SCREECHES)

15:31.097 --> 15:32.530
MAVIS: (LAUGHING) Awesome!

15:32.532 --> 15:33.631
There's just one last thing

15:33.633 --> 15:36.200
you need to be able
to do as a vampire.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.135
(GROANING)

15:37.137 --> 15:39.404
Learn to rejuvenate.

15:39.738 --> 15:42.240
Oh. That I can do.

15:42.975 --> 15:45.610
(SNORING)

15:45.612 --> 15:45.977
(GASPING)

15:45.979 --> 15:49.013
Do you always nap
with the Queen of Darkness
watching over you?

15:49.015 --> 15:52.784
It is time for
the Dracula Family
meeting to commence.

15:52.786 --> 15:55.486
Hank, you nap.
I'll be right bat.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.220
AUNT LYDIA: Nonsense!

15:56.222 --> 15:59.357
Lycidias' thumb
will be our guest of honor.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.726
(GRUNTING)

16:02.428 --> 16:03.695
(LAUGHS)

16:03.829 --> 16:07.465
Wow. Aunt Lydia just
smiled at you. Kind of.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.401
And disappeared into
a cloud of smoke.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.003
Can you teach me to do that?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.438
(FARTING)

16:13.440 --> 16:15.473
(COUGHING) Never mind.

16:15.475 --> 16:17.375
Ew. Stop!

16:18.344 --> 16:21.412
Now, to the matter at hand.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.113
See what I did there?

16:22.115 --> 16:26.951
The addition of a new portrait
to the Hall of Draculas.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.619
(CLAPPING)

16:28.621 --> 16:31.389
Yes! I've been waiting
since forever

16:31.391 --> 16:34.025
to get my portrait
in the Hall of Draculas!

16:34.027 --> 16:38.730
Zombie Michelangelo
will of course do the honors.

16:38.732 --> 16:39.330
Michael!

16:39.332 --> 16:44.102
I present to you
the Thumb of Lycidias.

16:45.637 --> 16:48.206
Hank's thumb
is getting a portrait?

16:48.208 --> 16:51.442
I don't even
have a portrait
in the Hall of Draculas,

16:51.444 --> 16:52.810
and I am a Dracula!

16:52.812 --> 16:57.148
Yes, well, so is the thumb,
and it's much older than you.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.583
Aw, yeah!

16:58.585 --> 17:00.284
But it's just a thumb!

17:00.286 --> 17:02.687
All thumbs are good for
is hitchhiking,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.055
and giving the thumbs up,

17:04.057 --> 17:04.955
and having a thumb war.

17:04.958 --> 17:08.693
Okay, okay, fine, we need
thumbs, whatever, but still!

17:08.694 --> 17:09.794
This is so unfair!

17:09.796 --> 17:14.065
Save your indignance for when
the thumb is to be coronated

17:14.067 --> 17:16.300
with a royal portrait raising.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.367
Oh. You're right.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.104
That's a much better thing
to freak out over...

17:20.106 --> 17:20.704
What? (THUDDING)

17:20.707 --> 17:24.608
A royal portrait raising's for
the most revered of Draculas!

17:24.611 --> 17:27.478
You have to be
2,000 years old!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.781
Lycidias' thumb is revered,

17:29.783 --> 17:32.150
and over 2,000 years old.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.919
But it's just a thumb!

17:35.421 --> 17:38.656
That is a lovely cape,
Lycidias.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.124
THUMB: Thank you.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.928
(GRUNTING)
Uh, luggage over there!

17:45.531 --> 17:47.598
Uh, you missed a spot!

17:48.033 --> 17:51.936
Being declared a Dracula
has completely gone
to Hank's head.

17:51.938 --> 17:55.106
I mean, thumb.
It's driving me batty!

17:55.108 --> 17:57.575
HANK: Welcome to
Hotel Transylvania!

17:57.577 --> 18:00.244
Did you know
that my left thumb
is a Dracula?

18:00.246 --> 18:03.347
Yeah, it may run
this place one day!

18:03.349 --> 18:05.383
Excellent work, Mr. Stein.

18:05.385 --> 18:08.219
Nothing to thumb
your nose at. Hmm.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.587
MAVIS: Excellent work?

18:09.589 --> 18:12.023
Did she just wink,
and make a joke?

18:12.025 --> 18:13.858
A bad one, yeah, but a joke?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.094
Aunt Lydia is fawning
all over Hank,

18:16.096 --> 18:17.695
and his thumb
is getting everything

18:17.697 --> 18:19.697
I've been working so hard for.

18:19.699 --> 18:23.134
The portrait, the hotel,
her respect!

18:23.136 --> 18:24.302
I've got to do something.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.572
You could reorganize
my shoe collection!

18:27.574 --> 18:28.739
Oh. I have no feet.

18:28.741 --> 18:32.577
How about you sneak in
while Hank is sleeping,

18:32.579 --> 18:33.010
take his thumb,

18:33.012 --> 18:36.047
and have Zombie Da Vinci
build you a flying machine.

18:36.049 --> 18:36.981
No, a time machine!

18:36.983 --> 18:38.649
Oh, okay, yeah, fine.
A time machine.

18:38.651 --> 18:41.886
WENDY: But first, have him
design an impenetrable box.

18:41.888 --> 18:42.720
PEDRO: Okay, a box.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.088
Put the thumb
in the impenetrable box.

18:44.090 --> 18:46.090
WENDY: <i>And time travel</i>
<i>all the way back...</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:47.859
To Ancient Egypt.

18:47.861 --> 18:49.327
And say hi to my man King Tut!

18:49.329 --> 18:53.131
Uh, you mean the King Tut
who could mummify Hank's thumb

18:53.133 --> 18:55.399
only to have it show up
back here?

18:55.401 --> 18:56.400
Right. No good. Okay.

18:56.402 --> 18:59.604
You should travel back
to the age of the dinosaurs?

18:59.606 --> 19:01.205
WENDY: <i>Yes. The dinosaurs!</i>

19:01.207 --> 19:02.406
<i>Feed it to a T-Rex,</i>

19:02.408 --> 19:04.609
<i>but do it quickly,</i>
<i>when you get back</i>

19:04.611 --> 19:07.545
I really wanna have
a glitter bomb dance party!

19:07.547 --> 19:09.814
<i>â™ª Glitter bomb,</i>
<i>bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb â™ª</i>

19:09.816 --> 19:12.083
So?
I didn't hear a word
you guys said.

19:12.085 --> 19:12.683
Come on!

19:12.685 --> 19:14.986
Is that a no
to the glitter bomb?

19:14.988 --> 19:16.220
(FANFARE PLAYING)
(GASPING)

19:16.222 --> 19:19.490
It's time for
the royal portrait raising!

19:19.492 --> 19:20.424
AUNT LYDIA: Mavis.

19:20.426 --> 19:22.560
A-blood-dumping
we shall go.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.761
A blood dumping
we shall, what?

19:23.763 --> 19:27.431
It means, you've been accepted
into the realm of the undead

19:27.433 --> 19:28.332
for all of eternity.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.735
<i>As they raise your portrait,</i>
<i>by tradition,</i>

19:30.737 --> 19:33.938
<i>a bucket of blood</i>
<i>is dumped on your head.</i>

19:33.940 --> 19:36.107
Lucky!

19:36.109 --> 19:36.674
BOTH: Ugh.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.442
Well, technically
it's not blood. It's...

19:38.444 --> 19:41.245
"I Can't Believe
It's Not Hemoglobin!"

19:41.247 --> 19:44.015
This can't be happening
to Hank's thumb

19:44.017 --> 19:45.383
before it happens to me!

19:45.385 --> 19:46.717
I know what'll
cheer you up.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.053
<i>â™ª How about a glitter bomb</i>
<i>Dance party</i>

19:49.055 --> 19:50.721
<i>â™ª Do the running blob</i>
<i>Here we go</i>

19:50.723 --> 19:52.056
<i>â™ª Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb</i>

19:52.058 --> 19:53.791
<i>â™ª Do the running blob</i>
<i>It's a bomb â™ª</i>

19:53.793 --> 19:56.561
Maybe you're on
to something, Wendy.

19:57.629 --> 19:58.262
(SNORING)

19:58.264 --> 19:59.931
HANK: I didn't think
I'd be so nervous.

19:59.933 --> 20:03.734
Ah, c'mon, you've got this.
You're a Dracula now.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.938
How did you two sneak
into the Vampire Catacombs?

20:06.940 --> 20:09.740
Connections, baby!
What's up?

20:09.742 --> 20:11.876
Glitter. That's what's up.
Literally.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.978
I took your advice.
I'm getting rid of the thumb.

20:13.980 --> 20:17.882
<i>Instead of bathing Hank</i>
<i>in "I Can't Believe</i>
<i>It's Not Hemoglobin,"</i>

20:17.884 --> 20:20.718
<i>that bucket is filled</i>
<i>with glitter, rose petals,</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:21.519
<i>and rainbow streamers.</i>

20:21.521 --> 20:24.755
All you're missing
is the unicorn. (LAUGHS)

20:24.757 --> 20:26.624
Hank's thumb
will look the opposite

20:26.626 --> 20:28.426
of what a Dracula
should look like,

20:28.428 --> 20:29.860
then Aunt Lydia
will think twice

20:29.862 --> 20:31.929
about fawning
all over him so much!

20:31.931 --> 20:33.664
Tell my thumb to break a leg!

20:33.666 --> 20:36.867
Aw. Look at
how excited he is.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.636
Yeah, and trusting.

20:38.638 --> 20:40.004
AUNT LYDIA: I call upon you,

20:40.006 --> 20:42.406
the current thumb
of Hank N. Stein,

20:42.408 --> 20:46.711
and the former thumb of
the great Lycidias Dracula,

20:46.713 --> 20:51.115
to be immortalized
in the Hall of Draculas!

20:53.952 --> 20:55.319
(SNORING)

20:56.855 --> 20:58.189
HANK: Mavis, Mavis!

20:58.191 --> 20:59.323
Will you stand with me?

20:59.325 --> 21:02.460
What was I thinking?
I can't do this to Hank!

21:02.462 --> 21:03.761

21:03.763 --> 21:05.062

21:10.103 --> 21:11.335
Ahhh!

21:11.737 --> 21:12.803
The glitter!

21:12.805 --> 21:14.538
(SCREAMING)

21:14.540 --> 21:16.007
So beautiful.

21:16.009 --> 21:18.175
I feel so... so...

21:18.177 --> 21:20.011
(SOBBING) Cute.

21:20.013 --> 21:20.678
AUNT LYDIA: Mavis!
(GASPS)

21:20.680 --> 21:26.417
Unfathomable that
you and I descend
from the same gene pool.

21:26.419 --> 21:27.485
Ugh!

21:27.487 --> 21:28.953
(GASPS) My what?

21:28.955 --> 21:30.655
Wow. Thanks, Mavis.

21:30.657 --> 21:32.456
You took that glitter
bath for me?

21:32.458 --> 21:35.159
I'm sorry, Hank.
This was all my fault.

21:35.161 --> 21:38.296
I'm happy for you
and your thumb.

21:38.298 --> 21:39.930
Best cousins forever?

21:39.932 --> 21:41.332
Best cousins forever.

21:41.334 --> 21:42.466
UNCLE GENE: Hey!

21:42.468 --> 21:42.967
My big toe!

21:42.969 --> 21:46.737
I've been looking
for that thing
for 1,000 years!

21:47.707 --> 21:48.606
(KIDS GROANING)

21:48.608 --> 21:51.509
HANK: So now what do
I do for a thumb?

21:52.044 --> 21:55.479
Okay, can I just say,
it's hilarious

21:55.481 --> 21:59.483
that there's
a portrait of a big toe
in the Hall of Draculas.

21:59.485 --> 22:01.519
I can't believe
I'm not a Dracula.

22:01.521 --> 22:05.222
I can't believe,
I ever thought you were one.
