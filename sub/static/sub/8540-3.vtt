[dramatic music]

00:05.092 --> 00:06.310
[sighs]

00:12.012 --> 00:13.665
We do this too,
you know.

00:13.752 --> 00:16.407
- What's that?
- Silence as a weapon.

00:16.494 --> 00:18.496
Make people uneasy.
Make 'em talk.

00:19.932 --> 00:23.588
I get paid whether
you talk or not, Teresa.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.895
CBI's been paying you
for five weeks now, doctor.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.723
This was supposed to be routine.

00:27.810 --> 00:31.596
Routine, like, you have to see
me after a shooting? Sure.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.990
Not routine like
I have to sign off on you.

00:34.077 --> 00:36.732
I didn't even pull the trigger
on Tanner. Jane did.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.126
You signed off on him
after one session.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.606
He has good mental health.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.956
Now I wanna see
your license to practice.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.481
- Ha ha.
- Ah, "ha ha."

00:46.568 --> 00:49.353
I've got six open cases.
I'm testifying in two more. I--

00:49.440 --> 00:52.922
It's not as if you have
anything to talk about.

00:53.009 --> 00:56.186
Mom dead when you were 12.
Three younger brothers.

00:56.273 --> 00:59.233
Abusive, alcoholic dad,
now dead also.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.625
It doesn't say abusive.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.498
[dramatic music]

01:05.978 --> 01:07.284
But he was, yes?

01:08.981 --> 01:11.636
This coffee tastes
like crap, seriously.

01:16.467 --> 01:18.730
- Are we done?
- No.

01:18.817 --> 01:21.211
Let's talk about
what you wanna talk about.

01:21.298 --> 01:23.474
- 'What do you do for fun?'
- Fun?

01:23.561 --> 01:26.651
That thing
when you're not working..

01:26.738 --> 01:29.437
I, uh, what does
this have to do--

01:29.524 --> 01:31.134
[cell phone ringing]

01:34.529 --> 01:36.400
Lisbon.

01:36.487 --> 01:37.445
'Yeah, I'll be right there.'

01:38.663 --> 01:40.143
Duty calls. I get it.

01:44.452 --> 01:45.366
Dr. Carmen?

01:47.063 --> 01:49.196
Why won't you sign off on me?

01:49.283 --> 01:51.372
Because there's something
you wanna tell me first.

01:52.895 --> 01:54.288
I'll see you next week.

01:54.375 --> 01:56.507
[music continues]

01:59.249 --> 02:00.468
How did we catch this one?

02:00.555 --> 02:01.730
Switchboard got
an anonymous call

02:01.817 --> 02:02.905
saying there's a dead body.

02:02.992 --> 02:04.689
It's two blocks from us.
Here we are.

02:04.776 --> 02:06.996
- There's just one problem.
- No body?

02:07.083 --> 02:08.084
No body.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.172
Oh, not the dumpsters.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.521
Please, not the dumpsters.

02:10.608 --> 02:11.740
Look around for the body.

02:11.827 --> 02:12.958
See what you see.

02:18.747 --> 02:19.965
Shrink day, huh?

02:20.052 --> 02:21.706
- No.
- Yes. Yes.

02:21.793 --> 02:24.753
You have the line between
your eyebrows. He annoys you.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.278
And besides, you smell
a little of his cigar smoke.

02:28.365 --> 02:30.106
I'm annoyed because
I forgot my cell phone.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.629
Oh, right.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.588
- Cho, anything?
- 'Nothin'.'

02:35.590 --> 02:37.331
[instrumental music]

02:37.418 --> 02:40.551
Did you know that if
you weighed every living thing

02:40.638 --> 02:44.468
on planet Earth, a quarter of
that biomass would be just ants?

02:44.555 --> 02:46.035
- That's a lot of ants.
- It is.

02:46.122 --> 02:47.689
Cho, anything?

02:47.776 --> 02:49.560
No sign of a body.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.040
Alright,
then look in the dumpsters.

02:51.127 --> 02:52.868
Let's get out of here.

02:52.955 --> 02:56.437
- I did it last time.
- Oh, man, I just got this suit.

02:56.524 --> 02:58.526
[Cho]
'Alright, rock, paper, scissors,
on three, ready?'

02:58.613 --> 03:00.702
- One, two, three.
- Yes!

03:03.095 --> 03:05.881
It's been dry this fall, huh?
No rain.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.491
- Like tinder.
- Mmm.

03:07.578 --> 03:09.363
That's why those ants
are looking for moisture

03:09.450 --> 03:11.191
wherever they can find it.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.063
Then why aren't all the ants
in the wet, stinky dumpsters?

03:14.150 --> 03:16.587
Exactly, because they've found
somewhere else

03:16.674 --> 03:19.111
'where there's a little
more m--'

03:19.199 --> 03:21.810
Oh! Rigsby?

03:21.897 --> 03:23.203
'Little help here.'

03:23.290 --> 03:25.248
Oh, please.

03:25.335 --> 03:27.859
[door creaks]

03:27.946 --> 03:30.035
[dramatic music]

03:35.519 --> 03:38.000
[Rigsby]
'Looks like three to the chest,
point-blank.'

03:38.087 --> 03:39.393
Perfect triangle formation.

03:41.395 --> 03:42.787
[Cho]
'No brass,
looks like the shooter took'

03:42.874 --> 03:44.572
'the shell casings
with him. Pro job.'

03:44.659 --> 03:46.922
[Rigsby]
'I can't find any ID.'

03:47.009 --> 03:48.793
'Call forensics.
Run him for prints.'

03:48.880 --> 03:49.881
Who is he?

03:49.968 --> 03:51.100
Name's William McTeer

03:51.187 --> 03:52.188
from San Francisco.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.233
Serial child rapist.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.147
Served six years at Pelican Bay.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.497
And you know this how?

03:56.584 --> 03:57.846
I'm the one
who sent him there.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.543
Ah!

03:59.630 --> 04:00.936
We're near Marie's Donuts.

04:01.023 --> 04:02.938
Anyone wanna go
for a bear claw after?

04:04.200 --> 04:06.724
[dramatic music]

04:06.811 --> 04:07.986
Can't say I'm hungry.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.512
[theme music]

04:21.565 --> 04:23.175
[instrumental music]

04:23.263 --> 04:25.308
Jane, we have a case.
You think I've time for games?

04:25.395 --> 04:29.312
Life is a game. You have
plenty of time for that. Shh!

04:29.399 --> 04:33.142
Shh! I'm gonna read
your thoughts.

04:33.229 --> 04:35.100
I want you to take
a deep breath in..

04:35.187 --> 04:37.451
[inhales deeply]

04:37.538 --> 04:39.191
...and out.

04:40.932 --> 04:42.151
Will you concentrate?

04:43.935 --> 04:48.723
Name as many 20th century
presidents as you can...now.

04:48.810 --> 04:53.205
Uh, Coolidge, Wilson,
Roosevelt, um..

04:53.293 --> 04:56.426
...Eisenhower, Truman,
Kennedy, Nixon, L.B.J.

04:56.513 --> 04:58.733
Good.
Take another breath in.

04:58.820 --> 04:59.734
[inhales deeply]

05:01.257 --> 05:03.564
And out.

05:03.651 --> 05:04.565
[exhaling]

05:06.349 --> 05:09.700
Concentrate on which mug
it is under.

05:09.787 --> 05:11.528
I am listening
to your thoughts.

05:12.877 --> 05:16.098
Don't shout.
I can hear you.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.317
Open your eyes.

05:20.232 --> 05:21.364
[instrumental music]

05:21.451 --> 05:24.585
Well, you did have
a 25 percent shot.

05:24.672 --> 05:28.719
We could do it...all day,
and I would get it every time.

05:28.806 --> 05:31.069
Give me that.
How do you do it?

05:31.156 --> 05:32.897
You told me, Lisbon.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.423
Our minds are in sync.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.468
In fact, right now, right now,
I'm feeling something.

05:38.555 --> 05:42.646
I'm getting it right here.
It's a, it's a nickname.

05:42.733 --> 05:44.996
Saint...Teresa.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.437
How come you never told me
how you know Agent Bosco?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.920
Look, another one. Lisbon was
like a rock star for a while.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.357
What's with her hair?

05:57.444 --> 06:00.534
- What's wrong with my hair?
- 'Nothin'.'

06:00.621 --> 06:03.406
The McTeer case made your career
and you never said a word.

06:03.493 --> 06:06.931
You're like a superhero
with a secret identity.

06:07.018 --> 06:08.890
Uh, you wanna know the deal?

06:08.977 --> 06:13.242
Fine...McTeer hit
the bay area for 18 months.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.941
He attacked seven girls between
the ages of six and nine.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.379
I was the SFPD inspector
who caught it.

06:19.466 --> 06:23.470
I inspected, took McTeer down.
Now, what do you got?

06:23.557 --> 06:25.820
BFS found the shooter's gun
a block away in a trash bin.

06:25.907 --> 06:27.474
They're running it
for prints now.

06:27.561 --> 06:30.128
"Inspector Lisbon's actions
were lauded as heroic

06:30.215 --> 06:33.305
"by city officials
and her SFPD colleagues.

06:33.393 --> 06:35.656
Said her supervisor,
Lieutenant Samuel Bosco.."

06:35.743 --> 06:38.006
"Inspector Lisbon
did an exemplary job

06:38.093 --> 06:40.791
tracking down
and arresting this animal."

06:40.878 --> 06:43.359
Well, that's pretty good.
You should get an act together.

06:43.446 --> 06:46.362
- 'Can you do Barbra Streisand?'
- Don't tempt me.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.364
So I heard about McTeer.

06:48.451 --> 06:50.932
Weird, huh? I mean, here we are
again, after how many years?

06:51.019 --> 06:54.283
Too many.
Have you spoken to Dreyer?

06:54.370 --> 06:55.719
'He'd be my favorite.'

06:55.806 --> 06:57.765
Dreyer Whelan,
father of the last victim

06:57.852 --> 07:02.117
Katie, seven years old, promised
to kill McTeer on release.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.119
I called him. He's on his way
down from Moran.

07:04.206 --> 07:05.729
You're all over it.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.557
Let me know
if you need any help..

07:07.644 --> 07:08.993
...for old times' sake.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.212
For old times' sake.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.084
Here's McTeer's address.

07:13.171 --> 07:14.782
Parole officer says
he's got a live-in girlfriend.

07:14.869 --> 07:17.437
- Go and talk to her.
- He has a girlfriend?

07:17.524 --> 07:18.873
- I think I'll go with her.
- Good idea.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.614
Rigsby, check up
on McTeer's old friends

07:20.701 --> 07:22.703
from the pedophile world
especially those who might

07:22.790 --> 07:25.009
have moved from
San Francisco to Sacramento.

07:25.096 --> 07:26.446
Sure, boss.

07:26.533 --> 07:27.882
Cho and I have a trial meeting

07:27.969 --> 07:29.840
with the deputy AG.

07:29.927 --> 07:32.016
Not if I throw myself
into oncoming traffic first.

07:32.974 --> 07:34.976
[instrumental music]

07:35.063 --> 07:36.891
Miss Derask,
what was your relationship

07:36.978 --> 07:38.196
with William McTeer?

07:38.283 --> 07:40.851
- He was my fiance.
- Fiance.

07:40.938 --> 07:42.766
You have a problem with that?

07:42.853 --> 07:45.247
Oh, she just can't see how
a woman could fall in love

07:45.334 --> 07:48.293
with a convicted pedophile,
not, uh..

07:48.380 --> 07:50.208
'...the best husband material.'

07:50.295 --> 07:53.777
Bill was a good man,
a good provider.

07:53.864 --> 07:56.954
And he treated me like a queen.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.218
Those charges in San Francisco
were totally bogus anyway.

08:00.305 --> 08:02.177
That bitch cop
had it in for him.

08:02.264 --> 08:05.180
A vendetta
is what Bill called it.

08:05.267 --> 08:06.747
You gotta learn how
to clean that trap, Tanya.

08:06.834 --> 08:08.923
That's where the clog..

08:09.010 --> 08:10.272
[sighs]

08:10.359 --> 08:11.926
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:12.013 --> 08:13.754
It's the police, about Bill.

08:13.841 --> 08:16.452
My brother came over
to fix the sink for me.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.236
- David.
- Patrick.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.544
- Hey.
- That's Grace.

08:21.631 --> 08:22.937
David, do you know
William McTeer?

08:24.460 --> 08:26.680
I met him a couple of times.

08:26.767 --> 08:30.074
He treated Tanya good,
so, you know..

08:30.161 --> 08:33.338
Anyway, I just gotta reattach it
and you're all set, T.

08:33.425 --> 08:34.514
Nice meeting you guys.

08:34.601 --> 08:35.515
[Jane]
'You, too.'

08:38.213 --> 08:41.346
Do you know anyone who
would wanna harm William?

08:41.433 --> 08:45.873
Well, i-it's probably
nothin' but..

08:45.960 --> 08:49.224
...he had a fight
with his boss last week.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.139
Came home all moody.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.793
Said the guy was out to get him.

08:52.880 --> 08:56.231
- Who's his boss?
- Some pipsqueak. I don't know.

08:58.102 --> 09:02.019
Uh, XXXYZ Incorporated is
the name of the place, I think.

09:03.673 --> 09:05.545
It's, uh, over on Winley,
near the highway.

09:05.632 --> 09:06.937
[door opens]

09:07.024 --> 09:09.331
- Hey, mommy.
- Hey, Emily, baby.

09:09.418 --> 09:10.680
'How was school?'

09:10.767 --> 09:12.377
[Emily]
'I can multiply my sixes.'

09:12.464 --> 09:13.770
- Wanna hear?
- Wow.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.337
Maybe a little later, okay?

09:18.906 --> 09:21.082
Bill wasn't who you think.

09:21.169 --> 09:24.085
Hey, Emily.
I'm Patrick.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.956
- How are you?
- Good.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.871
- Good day, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.786
Six times tables, huh?

09:29.873 --> 09:30.787
Wow.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.007
Why don't you go
into the kitchen

09:33.094 --> 09:35.923
and help your Uncle David?

09:36.010 --> 09:37.098
It's okay, sweetie.

09:38.578 --> 09:39.622
See ya.

09:41.885 --> 09:44.235
[Emily]
'Hi, David.'

09:44.322 --> 09:47.195
I don't think
McTeer touched Emily.

09:47.282 --> 09:49.414
See? I told you.

09:49.501 --> 09:51.155
Because he was still
grooming her.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.896
You don't know what
you're talking about.

09:52.983 --> 09:55.769
You met Bill at a shopping mall,
didn't you?

09:55.856 --> 09:58.685
Near the video arcade
or-or the movie theatre.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.251
Emily was with you.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.992
He worked there back then.

10:02.079 --> 10:05.822
Yeah. Real gentleman,
not like your other guys.

10:05.909 --> 10:08.216
He-he never pressured you
to have sex.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.741
It wasn't love at first sight,
but he was just so good

10:11.828 --> 10:13.917
'with Emily.
He listened to her.'

10:14.004 --> 10:15.832
Nobody listened to you
like that, growing up.

10:17.051 --> 10:19.619
Bill wanted to be a father.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.925
My girl doesn't deserve
a father?

10:22.012 --> 10:24.188
Lately, he'd been asking
if he could take Emily away

10:24.275 --> 10:26.408
on an overnight trip,
maybe camping.

10:26.495 --> 10:29.672
A little father-daughter
bonding.

10:29.759 --> 10:32.283
'He'd been pressuring you
to say yes, just a little..'

10:33.807 --> 10:37.375
But just enough
to start to nag you.

10:38.725 --> 10:41.249
A tiny,
little scratching nag..

10:43.033 --> 10:45.296
'...that maybe what you felt
deep down was right.'

10:46.733 --> 10:47.777
William McTeer..

10:49.692 --> 10:51.085
'...was too good to be true.'

10:52.390 --> 10:54.566
[dramatic music]

10:56.786 --> 10:57.700
[sighs]

10:59.615 --> 11:01.356
You deserve a good man, Tanya.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.576
If you can't believe that
for yourself

11:04.664 --> 11:07.928
then just pretend,
for Emily's sake.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.676
We done here? Good,
cause I gotta eat. I'm starving.

11:16.763 --> 11:17.677
Yeah.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.157
Alright.

11:20.984 --> 11:21.898
[door opens]

11:30.907 --> 11:31.865
You each are the state's
key witnesses

11:31.952 --> 11:33.301
in a few cases this month.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.042
Agent Lisbon,
you've got Howard and Ang.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.566
Agent Cho, you've got Ringman,
Daily and Freed.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.524
Freed. Freed bit me.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.613
And be sure to mention
that on the stand.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.180
'Teresa, you remember Howard?'

11:43.267 --> 11:45.313
'He and his syndicate
stole $100 million'

11:45.400 --> 11:47.576
from the online accounts
of thousands of people.

11:47.663 --> 11:49.796
And then he stashed the money
and killed his partner?

11:49.883 --> 11:51.406
I remember him.
The guy's creepy.

11:51.493 --> 11:52.494
Guy's going to prison.

11:52.581 --> 11:53.669
Thanks to Agent Lisbon

11:53.756 --> 11:56.063
and her cool, calm expertise.

11:56.150 --> 11:58.326
That's me, cool and calm.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.458
So glad this isn't a Jane case.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.330
You havegotto tell him,
Teresa, that he cannot

12:02.417 --> 12:04.201
threaten people with bombs
to get a confession.

12:04.288 --> 12:05.637
'No rubber masks,
no monster suits--'

12:05.725 --> 12:07.465
Hey, we have a problem.

12:07.552 --> 12:09.380
BFS got a print off the gun
that killed McTeer.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.079
- And that's a problem?
- Yeah.

12:12.166 --> 12:14.255
Boss, the print is yours.

12:14.342 --> 12:16.257
[dramatic music]

12:27.094 --> 12:27.834
[Minelli]
'Your fingerprint
is on the magazine'

12:27.921 --> 12:30.010
of the murder weapon.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.228
Tell me why I shouldn't
be throwing up

12:31.315 --> 12:33.056
in the bathroom right now.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.015
It's a lab error.
It must be.

12:35.102 --> 12:36.756
They're overworked
and underfunded.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.410
This happened last year
with the LAPD.

12:39.497 --> 12:41.238
Just have them retest it.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.937
Come on!
You don't think I did this.

12:44.024 --> 12:48.158
What I think is, I'm up to my
asterisk in political quicksand.

12:48.245 --> 12:50.247
You and your team are off
the McTeer case, obviously.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.641
I understand.
Are we throwing it to the FBI?

12:52.728 --> 12:53.990
[scoffs]
No.

12:56.514 --> 12:57.689
Hey, Lisbon.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.083
- How about this, huh?
- Bosco.

13:00.170 --> 13:01.693
He knows as much about
the McTeer case as you do.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.086
It makes sense.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.959
And, yes,
I had to pull some strings.

13:06.046 --> 13:08.875
Thank you, I guess.

13:08.962 --> 13:11.747
No, no, don't,
don't misunderstand me.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.576
If you're guilty,
I want you nailed.

13:14.663 --> 13:17.405
I just don't want the feebs
strolling around my offices

13:17.492 --> 13:18.710
asking impertinent questions.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.060
Okay.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.409
So you understand,
I have to ask you

13:21.496 --> 13:22.497
some questions now?

13:22.584 --> 13:23.541
'Nothing personal.'

13:23.628 --> 13:25.717
Absolutely. Shoot.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.589
Hey, everybody.

13:27.676 --> 13:31.114
Uh, well, I bet you wish
you wore some gloves, huh?

13:31.201 --> 13:33.682
- So you have some input here?
- No. Just nosy.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.162
It's okay. He can stay
if he wants to.

13:35.249 --> 13:36.163
I'll stay.

13:38.905 --> 13:41.168
Where were you, Tuesday night?

13:41.255 --> 13:44.954
I was at home, watching
television. Nobody saw me.

13:45.041 --> 13:48.305
- What did you watch?
- Some reality show.

13:48.392 --> 13:49.916
Which?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.831
Cooking show, with the man.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.835
- Oh, yeah. That one.
- 'The angry man. Yeah.'

13:55.922 --> 13:57.140
Oh, I know the one.
That's good.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.750
Cooking show. Tuesday nights.

13:58.838 --> 14:00.230
- 'Yeah.'
- Angry man.

14:02.972 --> 14:06.062
So I can, uh, set up a time
for you to take a polygraph.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.631
[dramatic music]

14:11.198 --> 14:12.373
No.

14:14.592 --> 14:15.855
I didn't kill McTeer.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.682
Nobody said you did yet.

14:17.769 --> 14:18.727
Yet?

14:27.388 --> 14:28.389
Good luck with the case.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.480
[music continues]

14:34.612 --> 14:36.005
Having lunch?

14:36.092 --> 14:37.877
A discussion,
about Lisbon's situation.

14:37.964 --> 14:40.140
Okay, Cho, you say
work the McTeer case hard

14:40.227 --> 14:41.750
screw Bosco and Minelli,
you disagree

14:41.837 --> 14:44.709
and you're not so sure.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.668
I'm just saying, maybe
we should let Bosco do his job.

14:46.755 --> 14:48.670
Stay out of his way.
He's a good cop.

14:48.757 --> 14:50.541
Is anybody gonna go as hard
after this case as us?

14:50.628 --> 14:51.934
I don't think so.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.414
Well, you're assuming
Lisbon didn't kill him.

14:53.501 --> 14:55.372
What if she did kill him?
What would you do?

14:58.288 --> 14:59.942
What would youdo?

15:00.029 --> 15:02.423
Me? I'd walk away.
But I ain't the law.

15:03.641 --> 15:05.382
Yes, we walk away.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.210
- Yeah.
- 'I disagree.'

15:07.297 --> 15:08.603
McTeer went after
little children.

15:08.690 --> 15:10.170
Hey, maybe he deserved to die.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.649
If Lisbon has the guts
to kill him

15:11.736 --> 15:12.955
she has the guts
to serve her time for it.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.525
I'm gonna talk
to McTeer's boss.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.831
- I'll come with you.
- Okay, okay.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.095
Look, Lisbon didn't do it
anyhow.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.706
I mean, right?
She's not capable of that.

15:24.793 --> 15:25.968
I'm not so sure.

15:27.491 --> 15:29.493
[dramatic music]

15:41.636 --> 15:44.291
What's up that we couldn't
talk inside? I'm busy.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.075
Thought you might wanna be
outside so you could

15:46.162 --> 15:48.251
express your anger
without constraint.

15:48.338 --> 15:49.600
Why?

15:51.037 --> 15:52.952
I know you lied about the alibi.

15:53.039 --> 15:55.432
I didn't lie.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.173
I don't know what
you did on Tuesday night

15:57.260 --> 15:58.958
but you weren't watching TV.

15:59.045 --> 16:01.569
I didn't lie.
He made risotto.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.832
Now this is insulting. You're
gonna continue lying to me?

16:08.097 --> 16:10.708
[dramatic music]

16:10.795 --> 16:12.928
I can't remember.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.409
I can't remember what I did
on Tuesday night. It's weird.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.672
Thank you. And it's okay.
The memory's there.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.153
We can get it back. If
I put you in a light trance--

16:20.240 --> 16:22.459
Like that's gonna happen.

16:22.546 --> 16:23.983
Stop trying to hypnotize me.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.375
What if something
traumatic happened

16:25.462 --> 16:27.682
and you're blocking it out?

16:27.769 --> 16:29.379
I didn't kill McTeer.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.729
Well, let me hypnotize you
so we can be sure.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.557
- No.
- Why not?

16:33.644 --> 16:35.168
'Cause I don't want you
inside my head.

16:43.263 --> 16:45.656
So it turns out you're not
quite done with the McTeer case.

16:45.743 --> 16:47.919
- Funny.
- It's not my choice.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.096
- He'll only talk to you.
- 'Who?'

16:51.923 --> 16:54.404
- Agent Lisbon.
- Hello, Dreyer.

16:54.491 --> 16:55.927
[Bosco]
'Thanks for coming in
and helping us out, Mr. Whelan.'

16:58.321 --> 17:02.369
So, you guys are still
working together?

17:02.456 --> 17:04.023
Still a team?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.676
We're both handling
this interview

17:05.763 --> 17:07.678
at your request, Dreyer.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.419
We just have a couple
questions for you.

17:09.506 --> 17:12.292
Just one, in fact.
Did you kill William McTeer?

17:16.513 --> 17:18.472
I didn't.

17:18.559 --> 17:20.909
Glad to hear it.
How's Katie doing?

17:22.215 --> 17:23.129
She's well.

17:24.434 --> 17:25.566
Doing well.

17:25.653 --> 17:26.784
Healing better than I am

17:26.871 --> 17:27.829
according to our therapist.

17:29.178 --> 17:31.441
Where were you, Tuesday night?

17:31.528 --> 17:33.313
At home, alone.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.445
Katie spent the night
at a friend's.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.707
And what time--

17:36.794 --> 17:39.275
- You let him hurt her.
- Excuse me?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.885
I recently read
the incident files.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.539
[Bosco]
'The internal SFPD files?'

17:42.626 --> 17:44.063
How did you get hold of those?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.716
You could have taken McTeer
down the Friday before.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.153
A whole week earlier.

17:47.240 --> 17:48.719
That was not the case.
I didn't have it.

17:48.806 --> 17:49.938
I didn't have any--

17:50.025 --> 17:51.548
And in the meantime,
he attacked Katie.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.028
And you could have saved her.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.465
If I'd arrested him
on a hunch

17:55.552 --> 17:56.945
he would have been acquitted.
He would have walked.

17:57.032 --> 17:58.860
But Katie wouldn't
have been raped.

18:02.168 --> 18:04.083
And thatis your fault.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.998
[dramatic music]

18:08.609 --> 18:09.653
[Bosco]
'Mr. Whelan.'

18:09.740 --> 18:11.177
What?

18:11.264 --> 18:12.961
You swore you'd spend
your entire fortune

18:13.048 --> 18:15.006
in the service of killing
William McTeer.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.357
- Why didn't you?
- I couldn't.

18:19.707 --> 18:22.231
What if I'd been caught?

18:22.318 --> 18:24.059
I couldn't leave Katie alone.

18:24.146 --> 18:26.192
My take? Maybe you just
didn't have the guts.

18:27.976 --> 18:30.457
Go to hell, both of you.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.942
[Bosco]
'Don't worry about it.
He's angry.'

18:38.029 --> 18:39.205
Anger turns you.

18:40.467 --> 18:41.598
Yes, it does.

18:45.428 --> 18:46.864
I wanna take the polygraph.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.130
[dramatic music]

18:53.654 --> 18:55.438
[indistinct]

19:11.933 --> 19:13.543
[keys clacking]

19:24.032 --> 19:26.208
How long did McTeer
work for you?

19:26.295 --> 19:28.384
Uh, couple of months.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.864
His record
didn't bother you?

19:29.951 --> 19:31.561
Nah, freaks work harder,
you know?

19:31.648 --> 19:34.869
They're grateful for the gig,
you know?

19:34.956 --> 19:36.218
Not McTeer, though.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.785
Is that why you two
got in a fight?

19:37.872 --> 19:39.395
Me and him?

19:39.482 --> 19:42.050
No, we didn't get in a fight.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.183
He got in a fight with
his jackal buddy, Dog.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.010
They got in a fight right here
in the middle of the place.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.534
Busted it all up.

19:47.621 --> 19:49.492
So I fired his twisted ass.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.929
I mean, that's management 101,
you know, no fist fights.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.192
So I booted him.

19:53.279 --> 19:54.367
He come back at you about that?

19:54.454 --> 19:56.847
No, he knows better than that.

19:56.934 --> 19:58.762
He knows I'm connected.

19:58.849 --> 20:01.374
Connected, really? To whom?

20:01.461 --> 20:03.767
Oh! People?

20:06.553 --> 20:09.164
So what was it about?
McTeer's fight with Dog?

20:09.251 --> 20:10.818
[sighs]
I don't know.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.689
Could have been about
a million things, you know?

20:12.776 --> 20:14.387
Dog was a utility idiot.

20:14.474 --> 20:16.563
'He's dumb
in ten different ways.'

20:16.650 --> 20:18.739
- Dog have a real name?
- 'Everybody does.'

20:20.697 --> 20:22.743
I don't know what his was.

20:22.830 --> 20:25.659
Oh, those are on special.
Buy one, get one free.

20:26.790 --> 20:28.401
No, thanks.

20:32.056 --> 20:33.754
[female #1]
'People vs. Milton R. Howard.'

20:33.841 --> 20:37.845
'Case number 97T03254,
come on down.'

20:37.932 --> 20:39.586
Agent Lisbon,
we have to talk.

20:39.673 --> 20:41.675
How about you give me
a confession, Howard?

20:41.762 --> 20:44.417
Agent, I-I didn't do
these things they said I did.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.114
Okay? Y-you have to hear
my side of it.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.116
I'll see you inside.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.465
Agent Lisbon.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.162
Virgil, talk to her after.
We're up.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.903
Agent Lisbon will not
be joining you.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.122
Is my team okay?
Is somebody hurt?

20:54.209 --> 20:57.473
No. You failed the poly,
Agent Lisbon.

20:57.560 --> 21:01.390
"Significant indications
of deception," they say.

21:01.477 --> 21:04.698
You're relieved of duty, agent.
Report to admin for processing.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.743
- Boss.
- Don't.

21:07.962 --> 21:10.225
[dramatic music]

21:19.147 --> 21:21.628
Signature on the bottom.
Gun and badge in the tray.

21:35.685 --> 21:36.599
[gun clicks]

21:38.775 --> 21:40.690
[music continues]

21:41.735 --> 21:42.823
Here's your receipt.

21:45.173 --> 21:46.609
Have a nice day.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.846
[Dr. Carmen]
'Teresa Lisbon in my office,
talking.'

22:05.933 --> 22:07.804
You must be desperate.

22:07.891 --> 22:11.199
I failed the polygraph.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.985
Well, reading polys
is more art than a science.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.684
Ask to retake it.
I can teach you how to relax.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.515
[dramatic music]

22:24.473 --> 22:28.129
My father used to have blackouts
when he drank.

22:28.216 --> 22:30.131
One time, he beat my brother
half to death

22:30.218 --> 22:32.438
and he didn't remember a thing.

22:34.222 --> 22:36.050
The whole way to the hospital,
he couldn't believe

22:36.137 --> 22:37.094
it was him who did it.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.141
'Are you drinking?'

22:40.228 --> 22:42.926
Is that why you are talking
of blackouts?

22:43.013 --> 22:45.059
What I need to know is,
is-is it possible

22:45.146 --> 22:46.974
that I killed McTeer
and blotted it out?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.889
You can't remember
the night of the murder?

22:50.847 --> 22:53.459
Well, don't panic.
There could be lots of reasons.

22:53.546 --> 22:54.634
'Stress or--'

22:54.721 --> 22:56.505
Cops can become killers,
doctor.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.072
- It can happen.
- It's ridiculous.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.467
You didn't even know
McTeer was in Sacramento.

23:01.554 --> 23:04.557
His parole officer
called me last month.

23:04.644 --> 23:06.167
Courtesy heads-up.

23:06.254 --> 23:07.211
Well..

23:09.649 --> 23:13.783
Can memory loss be a result
of trauma? Sure.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.917
Your mind shields you
from the awful thing you did

23:17.004 --> 23:18.658
or even what someone else did.

23:18.745 --> 23:21.704
Child molesters
don't get better.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.055
The killer saved a child's life,
whoever it is.

23:25.142 --> 23:27.057
How do I unblock my memory?

23:27.144 --> 23:30.191
Maybe it will come back
on its own. Give it time.

23:30.278 --> 23:32.367
I don't have time.
You-you're useless.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.630
- You and all your talking.
- I'm sorry.

23:34.717 --> 23:37.416
Until you remember,
I don't know how to help you.

23:39.809 --> 23:41.985
[dramatic music]

23:48.078 --> 23:49.428
Jane.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.429
Mmm.

23:51.995 --> 23:54.084
Oh, hey, Lisbon.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.522
I imagine you want me
to hypnotize you now.

23:58.088 --> 23:59.263
- Yeah.
- 'Mm-hmm.'

24:01.048 --> 24:03.746
Nothing in McTeer's parole files
about any Dog.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.139
No known associates, either.

24:07.533 --> 24:10.187
Black widow...dead one.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.668
[Bosco]
'What the hell do you think
you're doing?'

24:12.755 --> 24:14.322
Killing a spider.
What are youdoing?

24:14.409 --> 24:18.326
You're interfering with my case.
You're talking to witnesses.

24:18.413 --> 24:19.936
You're wrong.

24:20.023 --> 24:22.286
- You gonna lie to me now?
- What's the problem?

24:22.373 --> 24:24.811
Drop the McTeer case,
or you'll be on guard duty

24:24.898 --> 24:27.030
at the state capital,
saluting tourists.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.296
Is that right?

24:34.951 --> 24:35.865
Yes, it is.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.045
- Nice comeback.
- 'You told him.'

24:42.132 --> 24:43.046
He knows the score.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.442
May I?

24:47.529 --> 24:51.098
Thanks. My guy at Pelican Bay
came through.

24:51.185 --> 24:55.450
Uh, McTeer had a cellmate
for two years..

24:55.537 --> 24:56.582
'...nicknamed Dog.'

24:56.669 --> 24:59.193
[Van Pelt]
'Hey, we know this guy.'

24:59.280 --> 25:01.543
That's the brother
of McTeer's girlfriend.

25:01.630 --> 25:02.675
David Charles.

25:02.762 --> 25:04.328
[dramatic music]

25:04.415 --> 25:05.504
[door opens]

25:09.899 --> 25:11.510
It's kind of a mess.

25:11.597 --> 25:12.946
Not at all.

25:13.033 --> 25:13.990
It's nice.

25:15.557 --> 25:16.950
I like those pictures.

25:17.037 --> 25:18.734
Those are mostly
from the last tenants.

25:22.346 --> 25:24.566
Uh, where-where
are we gonna do this?

25:24.653 --> 25:27.700
Ah, interesting.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.658
Let's just do it. Let-let's go.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.966
- No.
- No?

25:33.053 --> 25:34.663
No, I'm not gonna
hypnotize you, Lisbon.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.665
- You're, you're too stressed.
- Are you kidding me?

25:36.752 --> 25:38.667
No, it's okay, shh!
It's okay, alright?

25:38.754 --> 25:41.583
I'd have to make all
the stress leave your body.

25:41.670 --> 25:45.239
Maybe have you count down
from 100, 99, 98.

25:45.326 --> 25:47.110
We'd go round and round.

25:47.197 --> 25:50.940
94, 93..
Listen to me, Lisbon.

25:52.289 --> 25:54.814
All the stress
would have to melt away.

25:54.901 --> 25:59.166
You'd have to feel calm
and relaxed and very safe.

25:59.253 --> 26:02.082
It's just about impossible.
I'm not hypnotizing you, Lisbon.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.780
It's not gonna happen,
so you can just relax.

26:04.867 --> 26:09.480
You are not falling into
a deep, relaxing trance state.

26:10.394 --> 26:12.658
[instrumental music]

26:14.268 --> 26:15.791
Sleep.

26:15.878 --> 26:18.881
Okay. Good.

26:18.968 --> 26:19.926
Alright.

26:24.495 --> 26:26.628
'So you're going down
the steps.'

26:27.847 --> 26:29.631
'Relaxing with each step.'

26:31.502 --> 26:33.200
And now you reach the bottom.

26:35.071 --> 26:36.203
The very last step.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.162
The ultimate place of calm.

26:41.556 --> 26:43.166
How are you feeling?

26:43.253 --> 26:44.820
Good.

26:44.907 --> 26:46.735
Good.

26:46.822 --> 26:49.608
You're gonna remain
in this relaxed trance state

26:49.695 --> 26:51.784
'while we think
about Tuesday night.'

26:51.871 --> 26:54.134
But first..

26:54.221 --> 26:56.919
...sometimes you dance to that
Spice Girls CD, don't you?

26:57.006 --> 26:58.051
Yeah.

27:00.531 --> 27:01.489
I thought so.

27:04.448 --> 27:05.449
Now, Tuesday.

27:08.278 --> 27:10.454
You can watch the whole day
like it's a movie.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.458
Every detail is in focus.

27:14.545 --> 27:16.809
You can zoom
into any moment you want.

27:16.896 --> 27:19.420
You can fast-forward, rewind.

27:19.507 --> 27:22.945
Youare in total control, okay?

27:23.032 --> 27:23.990
Okay.

27:25.078 --> 27:25.992
Good.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.822
What do you see?

27:31.693 --> 27:35.305
I'm finishing up the Form 41s
on the Milbank case.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.874
I feel..

27:38.961 --> 27:40.920
...hungry,
'cause I skipped lunch.

27:43.052 --> 27:45.489
The new guy
in the mailroom is hot.

27:45.576 --> 27:46.752
- Is he?
- Yeah.

27:48.928 --> 27:50.146
Let's fast-forward a little.

27:52.279 --> 27:53.410
Later in the day..

27:55.195 --> 27:56.500
...you're about to leave CBI.

27:58.198 --> 28:00.591
Van Pelt's working late.
She's a hard worker.

28:02.332 --> 28:05.422
She might do well if she manages
not to sleep with Rigsby.

28:06.554 --> 28:07.686
Where do you go now?

28:09.905 --> 28:10.950
I..

28:13.561 --> 28:14.649
I..

28:17.086 --> 28:18.131
Home?

28:20.133 --> 28:21.090
Do you?

28:22.570 --> 28:24.267
Where-where-where
do you go, Lisbon?

28:24.354 --> 28:26.530
I'm in my car.

28:26.617 --> 28:27.923
It's low on gas.

28:29.055 --> 28:30.447
[breathing heavily]

28:30.534 --> 28:33.320
It's okay.
You're in a trance state.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.670
Everything is okay.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.280
- I can't--
- What do you see?

28:38.542 --> 28:39.892
Where do you go?

28:39.979 --> 28:41.720
I...I don't..

28:42.938 --> 28:44.723
It's blank.

28:44.810 --> 28:46.725
- I just see a blank screen.
- It's alright.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.117
It's alright.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.424
[breathing heavily]
I don't..

28:50.511 --> 28:53.383
I don't know where I went.
I-I-I can't remember.

28:53.470 --> 28:54.776
I don't know where I went.

28:54.863 --> 28:56.343
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay.

28:58.388 --> 29:00.303
I can't remember.

29:00.390 --> 29:01.783
That's a little weird.

29:03.350 --> 29:05.526
[sighs]

29:05.613 --> 29:07.267
I thought you were the best.

29:07.354 --> 29:08.442
'I want my money back.'

29:09.182 --> 29:10.531
Hmm. Yeah.

29:14.100 --> 29:15.971
Why can't I remember?

29:16.058 --> 29:17.756
It's interesting, isn't it?

29:17.843 --> 29:19.322
Yeah.

29:19.409 --> 29:20.454
Yeah, it's interesting.

29:20.541 --> 29:22.151
Hmm.

29:22.238 --> 29:25.067
Well, you know,
th-thanks for trying.

29:25.154 --> 29:26.939
You probably have, uh,
somewhere you need to go, right?

29:27.026 --> 29:28.854
Well, I'm not gonna
give up that easily.

29:28.941 --> 29:30.812
[dramatic music]

29:33.554 --> 29:36.818
I can count on you not to tell
anybody about this, right?

29:36.905 --> 29:38.080
On the team?

29:38.167 --> 29:39.212
Oh, Lisbon.

29:40.430 --> 29:42.084
- Hey.
- Jane.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.346
I just need you to leave, okay?

29:43.433 --> 29:44.565
- Alright.
- Could you please go?

29:44.652 --> 29:45.784
It's-it's gonna be okay.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.002
It's gonna be fine, alright?

29:48.438 --> 29:49.483
I promise.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.792
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.630
Tanya? I got your text.

30:06.717 --> 30:08.545
It said 911.
What's going on?

30:08.632 --> 30:11.635
[grunts]
Oh! hey, help, police!

30:11.722 --> 30:12.811
Relax, buddy.

30:14.421 --> 30:16.162
Yeah, we're clear. You good?

30:16.249 --> 30:17.163
[Cho]
'Yeah.'

30:19.121 --> 30:20.035
You fought with McTeer
in the parking lot.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.471
He beat the snot out of you.

30:21.558 --> 30:23.169
That must have been
pretty humiliating.

30:23.256 --> 30:24.605
So you lured him into the alley
and you killed him.

30:24.692 --> 30:26.259
No, I didn't kill him.
I didn't!

30:26.346 --> 30:28.130
You didkill him, David.
You killed him.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.002
But it's our friend
on the hook for it.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.308
Look, Dog, jail is gonna
be so much better

30:32.395 --> 30:34.093
than what you get
if you keep lying to us.

30:34.180 --> 30:36.356
Look, your friend, the cop..

30:36.443 --> 30:38.880
She's the one who paid me
to bring McTeer to the alley.

30:38.967 --> 30:41.840
Look, I had no idea she was
gonna shoot him, I swear to you.

30:41.927 --> 30:43.406
I never would have taken
the money if I knew it.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.756
Agent Lisbon,
she's the one who paid you?

30:45.844 --> 30:47.410
Yeah, I mean,
it had to be her, didn't it?

30:47.497 --> 30:49.412
I heard you guys already
arrested her for it.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.937
But you're guessing, right?
You never actually saw her.

30:52.024 --> 30:55.157
Well, I didn't see anybody.

30:55.244 --> 30:56.680
It was all text.

30:56.767 --> 30:58.552
The deal was I got Bill drunk.

30:58.639 --> 31:01.642
We went out in the alley to go
take a pee, and then I split.

31:01.729 --> 31:04.558
I heard those shots. I just
started running like hell, man.

31:04.645 --> 31:05.864
'And the next day,
there's ten grand'

31:05.951 --> 31:06.995
in my checking account.

31:07.082 --> 31:08.431
Ten grand?

31:08.518 --> 31:10.172
- 'Ten grand, Sam.'
- I heard.

31:10.259 --> 31:12.479
Ten grand just to lure
the vic in, not even kill him.

31:12.566 --> 31:14.002
This is somebody
with resources, connections.

31:14.089 --> 31:15.438
[Cho]
Someone who's not Lisbon.

31:15.525 --> 31:16.744
Seriously, where's she gonna
get ten grand from?

31:16.831 --> 31:17.919
No offense, boss.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.660
I will have Van Pelt
track the text.

31:19.747 --> 31:21.357
Cho and I will talk
to the guy's bank.

31:21.444 --> 31:23.707
Lisbon, get this
through your head.

31:23.794 --> 31:25.622
You're relieved of duty.

31:25.709 --> 31:26.928
You're not even supposed
to be in the building

31:27.015 --> 31:29.496
and you two clowns
are wayout of hand.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.628
Let me deal with this.
Come here.

31:37.373 --> 31:40.550
Lisbon, look at me. Look at me.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.902
I'll handle it.
Will you please trust me?

31:43.989 --> 31:46.861
I'm sorry.
You don't understand.

31:46.948 --> 31:48.384
Later, you will.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.083
What are-are-are you
medicated or something?

31:51.170 --> 31:53.737
Okay, I'm alright.
I'm fine.

31:53.824 --> 31:57.393
What the hell is everybody
looking at? I'm fine!

31:57.480 --> 32:00.048
Just stay the hell away from me.
I'm done with this crap.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.484
I am done.

32:01.571 --> 32:03.660
Get out of my way.
I'm sick of everybody.

32:04.661 --> 32:06.925
[dramatic music]

32:16.760 --> 32:18.197
What was that, Lisbon?

32:18.284 --> 32:19.546
[Rigsby]
'She's freaking out.'

32:19.633 --> 32:21.287
Oh, come on.
It's just Lisbon.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.811
- She's a little stressed.
- What is going on?

32:34.822 --> 32:35.954
Sorry.

32:37.607 --> 32:40.393
- Why is this happening to me?
- It's alright.

32:40.480 --> 32:43.135
- Let's-let's go home.
- I'll take her.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.571
No. Leave me alone.

32:57.888 --> 33:00.152
[music on earphones]

33:06.810 --> 33:09.161
[dramatic music]

33:28.615 --> 33:30.443
The ten grand paid
to David Charles

33:30.530 --> 33:32.967
came from an account owned by
a shell company in the Caymans.

33:33.054 --> 33:34.186
Well, that's good.

33:34.273 --> 33:35.970
The day after it paid David

33:36.057 --> 33:38.146
the account paid out a million
dollars to someone else.

33:38.233 --> 33:39.887
I bet that's for the shooter.
Can we trace the payment?

33:39.974 --> 33:41.193
Uh, I'm trying, but--

33:41.280 --> 33:42.977
You'll find it dead-ends
in a blind account

33:43.064 --> 33:44.761
that was closed yesterday.

33:44.848 --> 33:47.373
Okay. We are working
the case. We just want to--

33:47.460 --> 33:49.592
Forget about it. How's Lisbon?

33:49.679 --> 33:50.811
She's fine.

33:52.682 --> 33:54.032
She's fine.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.338
Well, what did she say,
exactly?

33:56.425 --> 33:57.905
Well, I didn't actually
talkto her.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.211
She-she wouldn't let me in.

34:02.518 --> 34:03.563
'You're worried about her.'

34:07.871 --> 34:09.221
You think she might do
something stupid?

34:09.308 --> 34:11.049
Suicide? No.

34:13.529 --> 34:15.140
If she did,
she wouldn't blame the bureau.

34:15.227 --> 34:16.750
That's not my concern at all.

34:18.143 --> 34:20.623
I should've taken her
off-duty weapon.

34:20.710 --> 34:21.929
Oh, I'm sure she'll be alright.

34:28.805 --> 34:29.937
[knock on door]

34:32.374 --> 34:34.681
Minelli asked me to drop by.

34:34.768 --> 34:38.250
Well, ordered me
to drop by, actually.

34:38.337 --> 34:40.643
- Can we talk?
- Minelli?

34:40.730 --> 34:41.731
He's worried about you.

34:43.211 --> 34:44.691
We all are.

34:44.778 --> 34:46.736
'Cause I had a meltdown?

34:46.823 --> 34:48.738
Got perp-walked out of the CBI?

34:48.825 --> 34:50.349
'Or because I killed a guy?'

34:50.436 --> 34:51.393
[dramatic music]

34:51.480 --> 34:55.267
Wh...youkilled McTeer?

34:55.354 --> 34:57.878
How the hell would I know?
Maybe?

35:00.228 --> 35:04.276
Uh, Teresa, you-you wanna
put away your Glock there?

35:04.363 --> 35:07.279
Very good eye, doctor.

35:07.366 --> 35:10.238
The Glock, 9 millimeter.

35:10.325 --> 35:13.459
The safety's in the trigger.
How stupid is that?

35:13.546 --> 35:17.376
I mean, it's kind of like
not having a safety at all.

35:17.463 --> 35:18.681
How about you give it to me?

35:21.293 --> 35:23.860
Don't look at me like that.

35:23.947 --> 35:26.472
Don't look at me like that.
This is your fault.

35:26.559 --> 35:28.735
Well, Teresa..

35:28.822 --> 35:31.433
You unlocked too many things
in my head

35:31.520 --> 35:33.479
and now I can't remember.

35:33.566 --> 35:36.917
My head is messed up,
and it's your fault.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.136
Teresa..

35:39.615 --> 35:40.834
...put it down.

35:40.921 --> 35:42.575
'You need to be calm..'

35:43.880 --> 35:45.752
...and put down the gun.

35:45.839 --> 35:47.014
Calm?

35:49.147 --> 35:50.931
You were right, doctor.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.802
There was something
I wanted to tell you.

35:54.804 --> 35:57.851
I act calm on the outside,
but on the inside

35:57.938 --> 36:00.723
I'm so angry, sometimes
I think I'm gonna explode.

36:02.464 --> 36:05.032
All the misery and the pain
that I see every day

36:05.119 --> 36:08.905
makes me wanna scream,
but I lock it down.

36:08.992 --> 36:12.474
I lock it down because
I have to be calm and rational

36:12.561 --> 36:16.174
because that's my job,
but I wanna pull this trigger.

36:16.261 --> 36:17.479
I wanna kill.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.481
You're angry. I hear that.

36:20.308 --> 36:22.354
[dramatic music]

36:23.790 --> 36:24.921
I think I did it.

36:26.967 --> 36:28.838
I think I killed McTeer.

36:28.925 --> 36:32.233
Shh, Teresa.

36:34.888 --> 36:37.151
'If you did it..'

36:37.238 --> 36:38.935
'...that's okay.'

36:39.022 --> 36:41.242
He was a bad man.

36:41.329 --> 36:43.636
No reason for you
to hurt anyone else..

36:44.941 --> 36:47.205
...or yourself.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.816
- I still can't remember.
- You can and you will.

36:49.903 --> 36:53.211
And when you do, Teresa, when
you push through to the truth

36:53.298 --> 36:56.779
all this weight and worry
will come off your shoulders.

36:58.520 --> 37:00.609
Okay.

37:00.696 --> 37:02.742
'I want you..'

37:02.829 --> 37:06.267
...to visualize
that scene for me.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.489
Relive that moment.

37:10.576 --> 37:12.578
You went into the alley..

37:12.665 --> 37:15.102
...after this terrible man.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.279
Can you see him?

37:18.366 --> 37:19.280
No.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.502
Well, yes. Yeah, m-maybe.

37:23.589 --> 37:26.548
Yes. You see him.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.898
You see the dumpsters
and the trash

37:28.985 --> 37:31.901
and the crumbly, old brick,
and you see McTeer.

37:33.686 --> 37:36.210
You see him there,
this-this monster

37:36.297 --> 37:38.604
who destroyed so many lives.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.345
It's too much.

37:40.432 --> 37:41.563
'See it, Teresa.'

37:44.523 --> 37:46.655
[gunshots]

37:46.742 --> 37:48.570
Live it..

37:48.657 --> 37:50.442
...the reek, the garbage.

37:50.529 --> 37:52.705
The filthy alley walls.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.881
The faded cross there.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.801
God might have mercy
on William McTeer

38:01.888 --> 38:04.151
but you sure as hell wouldn't.

38:04.238 --> 38:06.240
He deserved to die.

38:06.327 --> 38:09.852
'But you're still
a good person, Teresa.'

38:09.939 --> 38:11.419
'You can get through this.'

38:12.899 --> 38:14.379
The cross?

38:14.466 --> 38:16.468
Uh, what?

38:16.555 --> 38:19.427
The cross, Roy.

38:19.514 --> 38:21.516
'How did you know
about the cross?'

38:21.603 --> 38:25.041
It was inside the door.
Only the killer saw it.

38:25.128 --> 38:28.784
Well, Teresa, you told me
about the crime scene.

38:28.871 --> 38:29.785
No, I didn't.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.311
[gunshots]

38:38.011 --> 38:41.275
[Jane]
'Oh, beautifully done.'

38:41.362 --> 38:42.711
'Lovely work, Lisbon.'

38:42.798 --> 38:44.060
What are you..

38:44.147 --> 38:46.541
Of course, the cross.

38:46.628 --> 38:49.109
You couldn't resist
the imagery, could you, doc?

38:49.196 --> 38:51.851
- Lapsed Catholic, perhaps?
- What's going on?

38:51.938 --> 38:55.028
Surrender, Dorothy.
We got you. Brilliant, though.

38:55.115 --> 38:57.552
Made Lisbon come back
week after week

38:57.639 --> 38:59.902
so you get her fingerprints
off your coffee mug

38:59.989 --> 39:03.689
and dose her up
with, uh, Lorazepam?

39:03.776 --> 39:06.169
Double dose for Tuesday
to cause the memory loss.

39:06.256 --> 39:09.129
Memory loss you knew
Lisbon would conceal

39:09.216 --> 39:11.958
which made her fail
the polygraph.

39:12.045 --> 39:15.570
Quite the, uh, student
of human nature, huh, doctor?

39:15.657 --> 39:17.485
Well done, really.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.661
Your breakdown in CBI,
that was fake?

39:19.748 --> 39:22.534
[Jane]
'And how good was that, huh?
What about that?'

39:22.621 --> 39:24.710
After that, all I had
to do was get Minelli

39:24.797 --> 39:26.625
to get you to come
around here.

39:26.712 --> 39:28.104
I've been waiting for you
all night.

39:28.191 --> 39:29.454
There was one little thing.

39:29.541 --> 39:32.021
I'm-I'm just,
just one little thing.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.589
The Lorazepam? Maybe
that went a little too far.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.939
When-when Lisbon couldn't
remember the night of the murder

39:37.026 --> 39:40.856
even under hypnosis,
I knew she'd been drugged.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.859
The rest of it? Spot on.

39:43.946 --> 39:45.470
Very, very impressive.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.082
- Thanks.
- Not at all.

39:49.169 --> 39:50.562
[instrumental music]

39:50.649 --> 39:53.129
[grunts]

39:53.216 --> 39:55.958
You're under arrest. You have
the right to remain silent.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.612
Anything you say or do

39:57.699 --> 39:59.353
can and will be used
against you in court.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.529
'You have the right
to an attorney.'

40:01.616 --> 40:03.618
So this guy who gave you
the million bucks.

40:03.705 --> 40:05.011
You ever met him
face-to-face?

40:05.098 --> 40:08.014
You want him?
I want a deal, a good one.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.232
What I got, it's worth it.

40:09.319 --> 40:11.191
Two to five, minimum security.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.454
Oh, there won't be a deal.
We know who he is.

40:13.541 --> 40:14.934
Just curious if youknew.

40:16.022 --> 40:17.893
[instrumental music]

40:28.687 --> 40:30.906
[Van Pelt]
'It took us a while
but we traced the shell company'

40:30.993 --> 40:32.952
'back to you, Howard.'

40:33.039 --> 40:34.867
You paid Dr. Carmen
and David Charles

40:34.954 --> 40:36.869
to frame Lisbon
for McTeer's murder.

40:36.956 --> 40:39.567
These cash transactions
prove it.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.744
Discrediting a cop is so much
smarter than killing her.

40:42.831 --> 40:44.703
'We'd have been all over that.'

40:44.790 --> 40:47.270
But this way, her testimony
dies along with her career.

40:47.357 --> 40:49.055
How about you give us
a statement?

40:49.142 --> 40:50.186
Maybe help yourself?

40:51.840 --> 40:53.407
How about you kiss me?

40:53.494 --> 40:56.236
[dramatic music]

40:56.323 --> 40:58.107
You're pretty.

40:58.194 --> 41:01.676
So are you, compared to
most state prison inmates.

41:08.335 --> 41:10.337
[Bosco]
'I hear Minelli's
billing you for the glass.'

41:11.556 --> 41:12.644
[Lisbon]
'It's only fair.'

41:15.211 --> 41:17.736
You know, for a cop, you made
a very convincing lunatic.

41:19.694 --> 41:21.696
Jane must be proud.

41:21.783 --> 41:23.263
Maybe it's not good police work

41:23.350 --> 41:26.353
but I have to confess,
I enjoyed it.

41:26.440 --> 41:29.008
Letting loose for once?

41:29.095 --> 41:30.313
Look, I'm glad you got cleared.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.797
I'm sorry that we couldn't
let you in on the plan.

41:35.884 --> 41:37.495
You could have, but you didn't.

41:40.280 --> 41:41.411
[sighs]

41:44.153 --> 41:47.287
You should know that
if it turned out to be you..

41:50.508 --> 41:52.205
I know.

41:52.292 --> 41:53.511
Just so you do.

41:55.425 --> 41:56.731
[footsteps approach]
Enough said.

41:56.818 --> 41:58.124
I'm not interrupting
anything, am I?

41:58.211 --> 42:00.082
No. Night, Lisbon.

42:01.693 --> 42:02.737
Night, Sam.

42:04.217 --> 42:05.523
- Donuts from Marie's.
- Oh!

42:07.176 --> 42:09.788
I didn't see it, of course.

42:09.875 --> 42:12.094
What?

42:12.181 --> 42:15.750
- He's in love with you.
- Don't be silly.

42:15.837 --> 42:17.665
I know, hard to fathom,
but, uh..

42:17.752 --> 42:20.102
...there's no accounting
for taste, is there?

42:20.189 --> 42:21.147
Hush!

42:27.849 --> 42:29.895
[instrumental music]

42:43.125 --> 42:45.563

Stay tuned for scenes
from our next episode.
