WEBVTT

00:02.485 --> 00:06.677
What's the point?

00:07.279 --> 00:08.614
Unless you're one
of the lucky ones

00:08.615 --> 00:10.718
like Maggie from Altadena,

00:10.719 --> 00:12.742
who is spending
this ridiculous day

00:12.743 --> 00:15.527
canoodling with the love
of her life in a snuggie

00:15.559 --> 00:17.174
with three armholes...

00:17.175 --> 00:19.480
And, yes, we actually
live in a world

00:19.481 --> 00:21.419
where that product exists,

00:21.420 --> 00:22.779
I checked online...

00:22.893 --> 00:24.095
But for the rest of us,

00:24.096 --> 00:27.495
the old 2/14 is
just a sad reminder

00:27.496 --> 00:29.558
of everything that's
missing from our lives,

00:29.559 --> 00:31.607
or we never had,

00:31.619 --> 00:33.468
or the one that got away.

00:33.850 --> 00:36.829
So here's to you and
all your near misses

00:36.830 --> 00:39.307
with your little bow
and arrow, Mr. cupid.

00:39.308 --> 00:41.215
Thanks a lot.

00:41.721 --> 00:42.638
This is Nora Walker,

00:42.639 --> 00:45.087
reminding you that mom
is always listening.

00:46.149 --> 00:47.304
Okay, we're out.

00:48.105 --> 00:49.513
What the hell was that?

00:49.619 --> 00:50.094
What?

00:50.095 --> 00:53.518
First you're patronizing some
poor woman and her blanket,

00:53.519 --> 00:55.359
then you start berating a cherub.

00:55.360 --> 00:58.110
Sarah, I was emoting.
That's what I get paid for.

00:58.111 --> 01:01.640
No, mom. You get paid
to be the concerned

01:01.641 --> 01:04.626
but ever-positive mother
that none of us actually have

01:04.694 --> 01:07.105
but that we all need,
especially on holidays.

01:07.106 --> 01:09.133
If this were a real holiday,

01:09.134 --> 01:11.119
the post office would be closed.

01:11.277 --> 01:14.441
Listen, this radio
station is gonna close

01:14.442 --> 01:16.320
if you don't stop this right now.

01:16.321 --> 01:17.992
You know what? Tommy told me

01:17.993 --> 01:19.902
you have been working very
long hours. No, mom...

01:19.903 --> 01:22.395
I really think the overtime
is making you irrational.

01:22.396 --> 01:25.118
Irrational? You're
costing me listeners.

01:25.119 --> 01:27.180
First you break up
with Dr. Karl, who had

01:27.181 --> 01:29.062
our highest-rated show... Karl

01:29.063 --> 01:32.204
leaving the station is
not my responsibility.

01:32.205 --> 01:33.388
That's debatable.

01:33.389 --> 01:34.728
What is your responsibility

01:34.729 --> 01:36.994
is that collective turning off
of radios that just occurred

01:36.995 --> 01:39.326
when you were pining
for him just now.

01:39.327 --> 01:42.379
Oh, come on. I wasn't talking
about Karl, the pill.

01:43.144 --> 01:45.016
Who were you talking about, then?

01:47.540 --> 01:48.994
No one. I...

01:49.057 --> 01:51.154
I was just talking
about life in general,

01:51.155 --> 01:52.548
the old ups and downs.

01:52.549 --> 01:55.702
Well, stop it.
This is not public radio, mom.

01:55.890 --> 01:59.311
Our advertisers like
us warm and fuzzy.

01:59.349 --> 02:02.669
Well, look who's talking.
You're not warm and fuzzy.

02:02.685 --> 02:04.500
You are cold and prickly.

02:04.501 --> 02:07.927
I am not cold and prickly.
I am working, mom.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.466
I could not be happier.
For now, anyway.

02:10.467 --> 02:13.012
Listen to yourself, mom.
You've gone dark.

02:13.374 --> 02:16.305
I need you to get
your mom back, okay?

02:19.140 --> 02:20.973
Warm, fuzzy, love.

02:24.559 --> 02:25.584
Ugh!

02:26.782 --> 02:28.796
Scotty, we're really
booked solid tonight.

02:29.357 --> 02:30.661
You know, in case we
have any walk-ins,

02:30.662 --> 02:33.353
I'm thinking maybe we should
squeeze an extra 2-top

02:33.354 --> 02:34.485
into that corner.

02:35.701 --> 02:37.029
What are you wearing, by the way?

02:37.887 --> 02:40.994
Oh. Uh, Jonathan's coming over.
We're going power walking.

02:40.995 --> 02:42.468
We've been doing
it for a few weeks.

02:42.469 --> 02:44.066
Please tell me you
don't go to the mall.

02:44.067 --> 02:46.221
Is that velour?

02:46.222 --> 02:47.438
Nice.

02:47.611 --> 02:50.207
Make fun of the two old men
who like to walk funny.

02:50.520 --> 02:53.750
See if that gets you into heaven.
I'm sorry. It's... it's cute.

02:54.026 --> 02:56.928
So you guys have been, uh,
seeing a lot of each other, huh?

02:56.929 --> 02:59.033
Don't make it sound like that,
because it's not.

02:59.034 --> 03:01.594
Well, forgive me for being
romantic on Valentine's Day.

03:03.068 --> 03:04.013
Hi.

03:04.857 --> 03:05.487
Jonathan.

03:05.488 --> 03:07.606
Hey. Hey.

03:07.607 --> 03:09.001
You guys match, by the way.

03:09.002 --> 03:10.400
You guys part of a
power walking team?

03:10.401 --> 03:11.655
You're vicious. You know that?

03:12.675 --> 03:13.652
Come on. Let's go.

03:13.736 --> 03:17.323
Wait, wait, wait. Saul,
who's Franklin Norman Beenz?

03:17.324 --> 03:19.725
He made a reservation for
one on Valentine's Day.

03:19.823 --> 03:22.876
Frank N. Beenz? 
You know him?

03:22.877 --> 03:26.174
I know Edward Lemonde.
That's one of his cover names.

03:26.175 --> 03:29.875
You're kidding me. You know
Edward Lemonde, the food critic?

03:29.876 --> 03:32.420
Yeah. W-well, why would he come tonight?
It's a prix fixe.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.266
How well do you know him? Well,
he calls me occasionally.

03:35.376 --> 03:38.576
Really? Well, I accompany
him to restaurants.

03:38.918 --> 03:40.307
Oh, I-I didn't know that.

03:40.308 --> 03:42.339
Well, we're not dating. Whatever.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.303
It'd be fine if you were.
Well, we're not.

03:45.304 --> 03:46.913
Matter of fact,
he called me yesterday.

03:46.914 --> 03:49.618
I told him I was busy.
What... what did he call you about?

03:49.619 --> 03:51.229
Tonight, actually.
He didn't tell me

03:51.230 --> 03:52.521
the name of the restaurant.
Excuse me.

03:52.522 --> 03:54.774
He called you to invite
you to dinner here

03:54.775 --> 03:56.537
for Valentine's Day? 
Yeah.

03:57.200 --> 04:00.224
Hmm. So why did you say no?

04:00.611 --> 04:02.474
Well, I didn't think I'd
be comfortable with it.

04:02.475 --> 04:04.312
But, Jonathan,
he's gonna review us.

04:04.313 --> 04:07.566
What do you want me to do,
try to influence his opinions?

04:07.567 --> 04:09.424
No. Don't look at it that way.

04:09.474 --> 04:12.018
You know, just to
keep him company.

04:12.099 --> 04:12.980
Jonathan, I told you,

04:12.981 --> 04:15.527
I don't mind if you're dating.
We're not dating.

04:15.528 --> 04:19.238
I-I-I-I have an idea.
Why don't you call him back?

04:19.240 --> 04:20.245
I don't think it's too late.

04:20.247 --> 04:22.742
Wait. Laverne,
Shirley has a very bad feeling

04:22.743 --> 04:24.054
about this little scheme of yours.

04:24.055 --> 04:25.739
I don't understand
what the big deal is.

04:25.740 --> 04:27.620
You don't want him
to do this. Come on.

04:27.621 --> 04:30.425
No, no, no. I-I'd
actually love to do it.

04:30.426 --> 04:33.592
As a matter of fact, I should've
said yes in the first place.

04:34.726 --> 04:36.886
I'm power walking,
Saul! I'll be right there!

04:37.115 --> 04:38.551
You realize you're
pimping him out.

04:38.552 --> 04:40.593
Would you be quiet?
He's fine with it.

04:40.665 --> 04:43.721
We don't want a critic eating
alone on Valentine's Day.

04:43.722 --> 04:45.210
I'm coming, Jonathan!

04:45.891 --> 04:46.876
He'll do it.

04:50.659 --> 04:52.194
Okay. I chiffonaded the basil.

04:52.195 --> 04:54.387
All right. I added the
herbes de provence.

04:54.557 --> 04:55.373
Justin, what's next?

04:55.374 --> 04:59.042
Next is, uh, add the...

05:00.119 --> 05:04.646
Ventreche. Uh, yeah, cut that into,
huh, half-inch squares.

05:04.747 --> 05:08.340
All right? Mix in the
dissolved veal demi-glace...

05:08.341 --> 05:10.014
Mm-hmm. While smashing...

05:10.015 --> 05:11.470
While smashing your
head against the wall.

05:11.471 --> 05:13.832
Ser... Could you have picked a
more difficult dinner to make?

05:13.833 --> 05:16.586
Of course it's difficult.
It's cassoulet D'Artagnan...

05:16.809 --> 05:19.993
a French stew with lamb,
duck, veal.

05:20.249 --> 05:22.103
Justin, you don't
promise your fiancÃ©e

05:22.104 --> 05:23.805
a beautiful, romantic,
home-cooked meal,

05:23.806 --> 05:25.618
and then serve up a
plate of spaghetti.

05:25.619 --> 05:27.098
Sarah's been working really hard,
you know? Well...

05:27.099 --> 05:28.404
I want to do something
special for her,

05:28.405 --> 05:29.929
something out of the ordinary.

05:29.930 --> 05:32.581
Well, barnyard soup is
definitely out of the ordinary.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.026
You know what?
You call it what you want,

05:34.027 --> 05:36.399
but it's complex, extravagant.

05:36.400 --> 05:39.811
Women love the big grand gesture.
Yeah, you know, uh, Luc,

05:39.812 --> 05:41.124
I think I'm gonna
disagree with you there.

05:41.125 --> 05:44.300
Uh, I think women like something
a little more personal to them.

05:44.301 --> 05:46.957
Like... like Sarah. You know
what she would like? Chili dogs.

05:47.469 --> 05:50.952
I know, but if I do something
like that for Sarah,

05:51.279 --> 05:54.799
I will look like a cheapstake.
It's, uh, it's cheapskate.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.660
But a cheap steak is
what I'm talking about.

05:56.661 --> 05:59.313
Okay, Dr. Valentine's,
so what are you doing tonight?

05:59.868 --> 06:03.132
Uh... don't have any plans.

06:03.162 --> 06:04.345
Because you don't have a date.

06:04.346 --> 06:05.617
Look, there's a big
game on tonight.

06:05.618 --> 06:07.963
Pizza, Laker girls... It's heaven.

06:07.964 --> 06:10.467
Yeah? Sounds like fun. It is fun.

06:10.468 --> 06:11.619
What's next, Justin?

06:11.620 --> 06:15.715
Next. Next is, uh, okay,
where... Oh. Here it is.

06:15.757 --> 06:18.027
Add that to the thing.

06:18.770 --> 06:19.682
Oh, mon dieu.

06:19.945 --> 06:20.580
Bonjour?

06:20.581 --> 06:23.409
Oh! I was supposed to
soak the beans overnight.

06:23.410 --> 06:25.343
Is that bad? Yeah,
it's bad, Justin.

06:25.344 --> 06:27.199
It's not a cassoulet
without the beans.

06:27.417 --> 06:29.616
If you don't soak the beans overnight,
it's all ruined.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.248
This publishing house
that I'm vetting,

06:35.249 --> 06:38.497
these spreadsheets are...
They're great.

06:38.784 --> 06:39.625
Are you gonna buy it?

06:39.626 --> 06:42.289
I'd like to.
I mean, it's a no-brainer.

06:42.290 --> 06:44.330
Even if we can't turn
this company around,

06:44.331 --> 06:45.862
its physical assets and building

06:45.863 --> 06:47.731
are worth the price itself.

06:48.193 --> 06:50.493
Hey, honey, um, you know,

06:50.494 --> 06:52.598
m-make sure you don't
intimidate Sarah.

06:52.599 --> 06:53.952
You just started working there,

06:53.953 --> 06:56.959
and she needs to know that
she's the one in charge.

06:56.960 --> 06:59.504
I know. I grew up with her.
What are you doing?

06:59.505 --> 07:02.041
Just checking out some
apartments. Oh, good.

07:03.061 --> 07:05.585
Let me see some... Oh, uh, wait. Uh, um...

07:09.797 --> 07:10.526
What is this?

07:10.527 --> 07:13.167
Uh, that's, uh, that's your
mother's high school yearbook.

07:13.546 --> 07:16.009
Honey, I-I thought we agreed
that you were gonna stop...

07:16.010 --> 07:18.378
Did you hear your mom talking
on the radio this morning,

07:18.886 --> 07:21.629
talking about the
one that got away?

07:22.011 --> 07:24.252
That's Brody she was
talking about, Tommy.

07:24.253 --> 07:28.172
Babe, you are going way too far.
She had a framed picture of him.

07:28.173 --> 07:30.916
I saw it. And... and then
she got really uncomfortable

07:30.917 --> 07:32.517
when I asked her about it.

07:32.781 --> 07:33.416
I'm sorry.

07:33.417 --> 07:35.577
Just... the curiosity
is killing me.

07:35.800 --> 07:39.175
Nora, a woman with
eyes for two men...

07:39.277 --> 07:42.701
William Walker and her high
school sweetheart Brody...

07:42.742 --> 07:45.952
when suddenly,
she finds herself pregnant.

07:45.953 --> 07:49.188
Rose. So she elopes with William,

07:49.189 --> 07:51.352
but she has to lie
about the wedding date

07:51.353 --> 07:52.839
because she's knocked up.

07:52.840 --> 07:55.687
And the question still remains...
are you done?

07:55.996 --> 07:56.958
Oh, come on.
Don't you want to know

07:56.959 --> 07:58.848
if Sarah could possibly
be Brody's daughter?

07:58.849 --> 08:00.929
No, I don't.

08:01.302 --> 08:02.710
This is my family.

08:02.870 --> 08:04.591
Sarah is dad's daughter.

08:04.859 --> 08:08.155
Please don't mention
this to anybody.

08:08.272 --> 08:09.589
Promise me, all right?

08:09.631 --> 08:12.499
Things are going good.
I don't want to screw it up.

08:13.104 --> 08:14.592
Okay, I promise.

08:15.221 --> 08:16.534
Okay? No.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.247
Consider it over.

08:21.008 --> 08:21.935
Okay.

08:22.777 --> 08:24.924
Mwah. I'll see you tonight, okay?

08:24.925 --> 08:25.822
Okay.

08:25.823 --> 08:26.768
Love ya.

08:28.493 --> 08:29.870
Happy Valentine's Day.

08:31.000 --> 08:37.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:54.973 --> 08:56.095
Okay, once you're
done with the onions,

08:56.096 --> 08:58.384
start on the reduction.
I'll do the caramelizing.

08:58.917 --> 09:00.542
Scotty, how you doing? Hey.

09:00.543 --> 09:02.612
What's going on? Hey.

09:04.619 --> 09:07.953
Right. So, uh, look, I know this
may be a little last minute,

09:07.954 --> 09:09.663
but we were sorta... Okay, stop right now.

09:09.664 --> 09:10.742
I don't know what you
guys are doing here,

09:10.743 --> 09:11.975
but I need you to leave now.

09:13.426 --> 09:15.474
Can you do a little
cassoulet to go?

09:15.842 --> 09:17.766
No. A cass... No, I can't do that.

09:17.767 --> 09:19.187
I have a major critic
coming tonight,

09:19.188 --> 09:20.156
and I'm a little crazed, Luc.

09:20.157 --> 09:21.858
I would not be here if
it was not an emergency.

09:21.859 --> 09:24.071
I told Sarah that I will do

09:24.072 --> 09:25.375
something special for Valentine's,

09:25.376 --> 09:28.192
and... I failed miserably.

09:28.193 --> 09:30.989
You understand romance,
how important the big gesture is.

09:30.990 --> 09:33.079
I get romance. I just don't think

09:33.080 --> 09:34.912
you need shock and
awe to prove it.

09:34.913 --> 09:36.053
All... What do you think, Scotty?

09:36.054 --> 09:37.023
Me? Mm-hmm.

09:37.024 --> 09:38.323
I'd take anything at this point.

09:38.324 --> 09:39.383
Kevin chose this week to

09:39.384 --> 09:42.912
attend a legal convention.
I'm sorry, man.

09:43.009 --> 09:44.828
Yeah. He didn't even send flowers.

09:45.022 --> 09:46.390
Hell, even Olivia sent a card,

09:46.391 --> 09:48.051
and we haven't even
adopted her yet.

09:48.101 --> 09:51.784
Kevin loves you.
I promise. Thank you.

09:52.311 --> 09:54.929
Oh, my G... I feel like
I'm in a women's bathroom.

09:55.045 --> 09:57.670
What is it about this holiday
that just drags estrogen

09:57.671 --> 09:58.532
out of dudes?

09:58.533 --> 10:01.862
Oh, that is so sexist. Love
is not restricted to estrogen.

10:02.846 --> 10:04.110
Thank you, Scotty.

10:04.148 --> 10:05.652
Tu es un amant. Tu comprendre.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.614
The littlest cassoulet?

10:08.750 --> 10:11.139
Luc, I can't help you.

10:11.140 --> 10:12.829
I have a major food
critic coming tonight,

10:12.830 --> 10:15.195
a husband out of town,
and an uncle

10:15.196 --> 10:17.252
who's pimping out his
friend for a good review.

10:17.253 --> 10:19.060
I can't help you. Okay.

10:22.894 --> 10:26.142
If you're willing to forget
the big grand gesture...

10:27.990 --> 10:29.220
Okay, what do I do?

10:29.221 --> 10:31.135
I have a suggestion,
and Sarah's gonna love it.

10:31.136 --> 10:32.000
Trust me.

10:33.210 --> 10:35.007
Nora, what are you doing here?

10:35.008 --> 10:37.793
I thought you'd be at work.
I came here to make a sandwich.

10:37.958 --> 10:41.096
What are you doing here? 
We ran out of mini springform pans.

10:41.396 --> 10:43.540
Now I know you have a whole
bunch of them here, don't you?

10:43.551 --> 10:46.551
Are you seeing Jonathan
on this special night?

10:46.552 --> 10:48.587
Well, sort of.
He's bringing Edward Lemonde,

10:48.588 --> 10:51.511
the food critic fr... Edward Le...
I know who Edward Lemonde is.

10:51.512 --> 10:52.152
Yeah, he's bringing him

10:52.153 --> 10:54.678
to the cafÃ© 429 tonight.
Isn't that cheating?

10:55.097 --> 10:56.073
What do you mean, cheating?

10:56.074 --> 10:57.365
Jonathan's not writing the review.

10:57.366 --> 11:00.110
Edward's writing the review.
No, no, no, I mean

11:00.111 --> 11:02.828
you. Isn't... isn't Jonathan
then cheating on you?

11:03.168 --> 11:04.047
How is that cheating?

11:04.048 --> 11:05.662
Jonathan and I are just two guys

11:05.663 --> 11:08.671
who happened to meet up
in old age. That's all.

11:09.728 --> 11:10.544
Found 'em.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.069
Saul, why don't you
live in the moment

11:14.070 --> 11:16.760
instead of constantly
focusing on the past?

11:16.761 --> 11:18.731
Oh, really? Look who's talking.

11:19.152 --> 11:22.468
Why don't you put away
your high school yearbook?

11:24.486 --> 11:25.926
Oh.

11:26.256 --> 11:29.447
You... no, I-I-I...
I was cleaning out a closet,

11:29.448 --> 11:30.534
and there it was. Ah.

11:30.578 --> 11:32.791
I was, "well, what's that doing"...
and what have we got... ah!

11:32.792 --> 11:34.155
You know what? This is private.

11:34.156 --> 11:37.421
That is Brody. I knew it.
I knew it. I knew it.

11:38.307 --> 11:41.391
All right. Fine.
I... I googled him. So what?

11:41.392 --> 11:43.056
You tell me so what. I don't know.

11:43.332 --> 11:46.121
I don't know. He...
he's just been on my mind

11:46.122 --> 11:49.402
ever since I saw that
damn picture, that's all.

11:51.379 --> 11:52.707
Do you want to see something?

11:53.185 --> 11:54.997
Look. Here.

11:54.998 --> 11:57.073
Oh. That's him surfing.

11:59.124 --> 12:01.049
And look, I... I just found this

12:01.050 --> 12:03.042
in a Sacramento newspaper. Listen.

12:03.997 --> 12:06.239
"In the fourth inning,
manager Nick Brody

12:06.240 --> 12:09.943
"was thrown out of the
game for arguing a call.

12:10.002 --> 12:11.882
"'My guy caught that ball.

12:11.883 --> 12:14.771
Anyone who says otherwise
can go straight to hell.'"

12:14.772 --> 12:17.623
oh, God. He was
always such a jerk.

12:17.956 --> 12:19.290
He was. Wasn't he?

12:19.291 --> 12:20.722
Let me ask you something.

12:22.361 --> 12:23.496
Were you in love with him?

12:27.828 --> 12:30.960
Well, you tell me.
Are you in love with Jonathan?

12:30.961 --> 12:32.809
Jonathan? What, are you crazy?

12:32.810 --> 12:34.051
What do you mean?
Where are you going?

12:34.052 --> 12:35.858
I have to get back to the studio.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.419
Be sure and lock
up when you leave.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.128
Well, hang on.
I'm gonna go with you.

12:39.129 --> 12:41.288
Come on. My car is blocking
yours anyway. Let's go.

12:48.736 --> 12:50.767
Wow. You're working
late on Valentine's.

12:50.768 --> 12:52.224
Tommy, can you close the door?

12:52.736 --> 12:53.825
Yeah. What's going on?

12:53.826 --> 12:55.583
I just got the strangest call.

12:55.584 --> 12:58.737
Are you negotiating
to buy Redlin's books?

12:59.260 --> 13:00.204
Yeah.

13:01.742 --> 13:03.694
How did I not know about this?

13:03.946 --> 13:05.745
Well, it's just
moving really quickly.

13:05.746 --> 13:08.002
It's great, though.
The guy just decided to sell.

13:08.212 --> 13:09.895
That's not what I
was talking about.

13:09.896 --> 13:12.106
Why didn't you brief me?
Come on, Tommy.

13:12.107 --> 13:14.651
You're not authorized to
start acquisition talks.

13:14.652 --> 13:17.548
Sarah, you should be patting
me on the back right now.

13:17.549 --> 13:20.493
I mean, this company
has huge potential.

13:20.903 --> 13:22.461
Even if we can't turn it around,

13:22.462 --> 13:25.007
the physical assets
alone are worth double.

13:25.216 --> 13:26.797
I don't care if we
triple our money.

13:26.798 --> 13:28.738
You're not authorized to
make decisions like that

13:28.739 --> 13:30.235
without consulting me. I mean,

13:30.236 --> 13:32.558
what am I doing here,
using up office supplies?

13:32.559 --> 13:34.371
Tommy, all I'm asking you
is that you consult me

13:34.372 --> 13:35.937
before you put me in
this position, okay?

13:35.938 --> 13:37.453
I felt like a complete
schmuck on the phone.

13:37.454 --> 13:40.136
I was totally in the dark,
okay? Okay.

13:41.764 --> 13:43.236
This is not Ojai foods.

13:43.271 --> 13:45.561
You know, rose said you were
gonna be threatened by this.

13:46.114 --> 13:47.977
Rose is a-a psychologist now?

13:47.978 --> 13:49.454
I thought she was a genealogist.

13:49.455 --> 13:50.831
What is your problem with her?

13:50.832 --> 13:52.879
Uh, let's start with the
fact that she thinks

13:52.880 --> 13:54.205
I'd be threatened by you.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.582
This is just killing you,
isn't it?

13:56.606 --> 13:57.553
I don't even know what

13:57.554 --> 13:59.552
you're talking about right now.
It's just funny.

13:59.553 --> 14:03.689
What? Ojai closes, and you,
what? You walk away with 50 mil?

14:03.690 --> 14:06.075
I got what I did, Tommy,
because I stayed here.

14:06.076 --> 14:07.977
I fought and I worked my ass off

14:07.978 --> 14:09.622
while you went down to Mexico to,
I don't know,

14:09.638 --> 14:12.360
irrigate corn or...
I was trying to save my life.

14:12.361 --> 14:15.217
Tommy, it is exhausting letting
you in and out of this family.

14:15.218 --> 14:17.749
At least I know I'm actually
part of this family.

14:19.066 --> 14:20.762
What's that supposed to mean?

14:22.588 --> 14:24.601
Rose found out th...

14:24.602 --> 14:26.490
Rose found out what?

14:27.295 --> 14:28.993
It's nothing. It's stupid.

14:28.994 --> 14:30.482
I shouldn't have said anything.

14:31.804 --> 14:32.716
Tommy?

14:45.308 --> 14:46.268
Hey, mom.

14:46.504 --> 14:48.169
Tommy. Hi.

14:48.858 --> 14:49.938
What are you doing here?

14:50.787 --> 14:51.811
Working.

14:52.528 --> 14:54.496
Yeah. Me, too.

14:54.926 --> 14:57.885
I'm going over tomorrow's
show so I don't accidentally

14:57.886 --> 15:00.510
send someone into a
clinical depression.

15:01.756 --> 15:03.563
Why aren't you having
dinner with rose?

15:03.610 --> 15:05.918
Mom, uh...

15:05.919 --> 15:07.937
I screwed up.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.367
What did you do?

15:10.899 --> 15:13.701
Rose found your marriage
certificate online.

15:13.702 --> 15:14.696
Not on purpose.

15:14.697 --> 15:17.942
She was googling you for
the family tree stuff,

15:17.943 --> 15:21.170
and she found out that...

15:21.171 --> 15:23.892
That what?

15:25.326 --> 15:27.904
That I was pregnant
when I got married?

15:28.241 --> 15:30.373
There. I said it. How's that?

15:30.740 --> 15:32.520
But now it's out there.

15:32.521 --> 15:35.128
You can all just have
at my sordid past

15:35.129 --> 15:36.490
like a bunch of vultures.

15:38.010 --> 15:40.624
But what a... what a...
what about Brody, mom?

15:42.992 --> 15:44.628
What about him?

15:45.021 --> 15:46.629
Well, you were...

15:46.630 --> 15:49.419
Seeing him at the same
time you were seeing dad.

15:49.420 --> 15:51.217
Did you ever think that...

15:51.218 --> 15:54.100
Did I ever think what?

15:55.485 --> 15:57.016
Did you sleep with him?

15:57.017 --> 15:58.995
How dare you, Tommy?

15:58.996 --> 16:01.439
I'm sorry. If it's not possible,
it's not possible.

16:01.440 --> 16:05.029
It's not possible.
Sarah is your father's daughter.

16:05.030 --> 16:06.528
And...

16:07.464 --> 16:09.770
Oh, God. No, Tommy. Oh, God.

16:09.771 --> 16:12.214
You didn't mention
this to Sarah, did you?

16:12.733 --> 16:14.022
Mom...

16:14.023 --> 16:16.373
Oh, damn it,
Tommy! You did screw up.

16:16.374 --> 16:18.388
I'm... I'm sorry, mom.
Can you just wait a minute?

16:18.389 --> 16:20.425
I don't have time
to stand around here

16:20.426 --> 16:21.724
and help you feel better.

16:21.725 --> 16:23.518
I have to find your sister.

16:23.519 --> 16:26.201
This is none of
your damn business.

16:26.202 --> 16:29.439
And it certainly
isn't any of rose's.

16:41.316 --> 16:43.787
I mean... this is nice, huh?

16:43.788 --> 16:45.881
Justin, it smells
like feet in here.

16:45.882 --> 16:48.923
Oh, come on. When I went
inside and asked the waitress

16:48.924 --> 16:51.017
if we could borrow a
tablecloth and a candle

16:51.018 --> 16:52.724
for a little romantic
Valentine's dinner,

16:52.725 --> 16:53.936
I mean, she almost cried.

16:53.937 --> 16:55.313
And you took that as a good thing?

16:55.314 --> 16:56.812
Oh, tell me this...

16:56.813 --> 16:58.072
Did Sarah, yes or no,

16:58.073 --> 16:59.377
say she loves to bowl?

16:59.378 --> 17:01.191
Yeah, when she was 8 years old.

17:01.192 --> 17:03.593
Okay, when Rebecca and
I first started dating,

17:03.594 --> 17:05.388
she had mentioned that, as a kid,

17:05.390 --> 17:06.502
she liked the Ferris wheel.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.339
So I took her to
Santa Monica pier,

17:08.339 --> 17:09.903
paid the guy who was
running the Ferris wheel.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.339
He let us ride it for 20 minutes.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.759
She said it was, like,
one of the most romantic things

17:13.760 --> 17:15.204
anybody had ever done for her.

17:15.204 --> 17:16.106
Really?

17:16.107 --> 17:18.267
Yeah, really. And there
was gonna be some awesome

17:18.268 --> 17:19.928
post-Ferris wheel sex after,

17:19.929 --> 17:21.012
but I got a little nauseous...

17:21.012 --> 17:23.109
Okay, okay, Justin,
you've said enough.

17:23.111 --> 17:26.515
Fine. I'm here, all right?
I'm betting on you, Justin.

17:26.516 --> 17:27.839
Trust me.

17:28.997 --> 17:30.768
Oh, man.

17:30.769 --> 17:33.003
I forgot how much I miss bowling.

17:33.004 --> 17:34.805
Maybe I could roll one? Justin.

17:34.823 --> 17:37.333
Okay, fine. Look, text me.
I want to know how it goes.

17:37.334 --> 17:38.653
She's gonna love it. Thank you.

17:38.654 --> 17:39.322
Good luck. Thank you.

17:40.342 --> 17:41.921
Hey. Yeah.

17:41.922 --> 17:43.480
You gonna be okay?

17:43.515 --> 17:45.782
Yeah. Pizza and laker girls.
Come on.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.021
Okay.

17:49.262 --> 17:51.526
Oh, it's her. She's probably here.

17:51.952 --> 17:53.228
Hello.

17:55.415 --> 17:58.640
Yeah. No, no. It's all right.

17:59.681 --> 18:03.180
I'm just gonna bowl a
little bit with Justin.

18:03.594 --> 18:05.668
I'll see you at home. Yeah.

18:07.897 --> 18:09.544
What happened?

18:09.984 --> 18:11.885
She still has work to do.

18:11.919 --> 18:13.820
It's not all that bad.

18:14.649 --> 18:16.430
I'll spot you 50 pins.

18:16.431 --> 18:18.324
Let's do this. Hold that.

18:28.123 --> 18:29.697
You know, I still
get a little kick

18:29.698 --> 18:32.301
out of booking anonymously.

18:32.302 --> 18:34.424
I think you should
retire Frank N. Beenz.

18:34.425 --> 18:37.509
People are gonna start
getting suspicious.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.419
So, gentlemen, good evening. Hmm.

18:39.420 --> 18:42.097
Happy Valentine's Day.
Welcome to Cafe 429.

18:42.098 --> 18:45.070
And, uh, so the
reservation is under...

18:45.071 --> 18:46.672
Beenz, table for two.

18:46.673 --> 18:48.690
Ah, yes, Mr. Beenz.

18:48.691 --> 18:51.480
I have a lovely table for you.
Please allow me.

18:53.153 --> 18:54.208
Follow me.

18:54.209 --> 18:55.909
I hear the food
here is spectacular.

18:55.910 --> 18:57.877
Well, we have all
night to savor it.

18:57.911 --> 18:59.365
I'll get it.

19:01.064 --> 19:02.799
Thank you, Edward. 
Ah.

19:07.317 --> 19:08.768
Voila.

19:08.769 --> 19:10.304
It's a bit dim back here,
isn't it?

19:10.305 --> 19:11.228
I like dim.

19:11.229 --> 19:14.955
Do you like dim? 
Ah, well, in that case, allow me.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.122
How about that?

19:17.123 --> 19:18.908
Ah, even better.

19:18.909 --> 19:20.370
Yes, better...

19:20.371 --> 19:21.860
And darker.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.688
You're sure your other
patrons won't object?

19:23.689 --> 19:26.711
Oh, not at all. After all,
it's Valentine's Day.

19:26.712 --> 19:29.852
So may I offer the gentlemen
a lovely glass of champagne,

19:29.853 --> 19:31.835
complimentary? Oh, I'd love one.
I'd love one.

19:31.836 --> 19:34.432
But my friend here is sober.
Boo. Hiss.

19:34.433 --> 19:37.461
Oh, true, true. But then...

19:37.462 --> 19:39.326
I don't need spirits to assure

19:39.327 --> 19:42.033
that I'll have a
wonderful evening.

19:43.249 --> 19:46.373
Well, I certainly
hope that you do.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.169
Oh, Edward. That is funny.

19:55.365 --> 19:57.338
I could kill Tommy.

19:57.339 --> 19:59.125
He made me swear not to
say anything, and then...

19:59.126 --> 20:01.665
Just show me what you have,
please.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.104
Fine. There's your file.

20:04.105 --> 20:05.869
You have a file on me?

20:05.870 --> 20:07.609
I'm not a stalker, Sarah.

20:07.610 --> 20:09.479
It's just part of
Nora's family tree.

20:09.480 --> 20:10.877
Okay, what's this?

20:10.878 --> 20:12.807
The marriage certificate.

20:12.955 --> 20:14.700
See the date?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.675
June 15th.

20:18.673 --> 20:20.449
Wow.

20:20.450 --> 20:23.225
So mom was a pregnant bride.

20:24.381 --> 20:26.830
All right. What about this...
this Brody guy?

20:26.831 --> 20:27.681
What have you got on him?

20:27.682 --> 20:29.427
Have you got a file for him, too?

20:29.428 --> 20:32.095
Yeah. Nick Brody.

20:32.096 --> 20:34.007
He's one of those guys who
goes by his last name.

20:34.008 --> 20:36.544
Mm-hmm. Uh, born and
raised in Pasadena,

20:36.545 --> 20:38.310
went to high school with your mom.

20:38.311 --> 20:39.516
Married and divorced twice.

20:39.517 --> 20:41.229
Could... could I have a
look at this, please?

20:41.230 --> 20:43.818
Yeah, but that's all there is.

20:44.271 --> 20:47.531
All I know is that she
was dating both of them,

20:47.532 --> 20:49.902
got pregnant,
and chose your father.

20:49.903 --> 20:51.494
You know what?
Tommy is a complete jerk,

20:51.495 --> 20:52.727
throwing this in my face,

20:52.728 --> 20:55.172
getting me all worked up over
it if this is all you have.

20:55.173 --> 20:57.119
I know. I can't believe
he said anything.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.928
What's this, my birth certif...
What are you, the FBI?

20:59.929 --> 21:02.028
It is so easy to find this stuff.

21:02.029 --> 21:03.211
This is scary.

21:03.212 --> 21:05.259
Hey. You're a jerk, Tommy.

21:05.260 --> 21:07.383
Hey, look, whatever
investigation you have going,

21:07.384 --> 21:08.868
just shut it down now, rose.

21:08.869 --> 21:11.755
Look, you're the one who told her,
after you made me swear...

21:11.756 --> 21:13.528
I know. I'm sorry. I really am,

21:13.529 --> 21:14.635
but just put it all away.

21:14.636 --> 21:16.554
Mom's coming home.

21:16.555 --> 21:18.001
Where did you get this?

21:18.002 --> 21:19.535
I just typed in
"birth certificate."

21:19.536 --> 21:22.442
Tommy gave me your social
security number, and...

21:23.328 --> 21:24.353
Why? What's wrong?

21:24.354 --> 21:26.732
Dad's signature is not on it.

21:27.063 --> 21:29.027
What do you mean? Dad...
dad didn't sign it?

21:29.028 --> 21:31.878
He signed the copy that I have.

21:34.535 --> 21:37.189
This one's from the
hospital's database.

21:37.190 --> 21:41.073
They must have reissued one,
and he signed it later.

21:41.432 --> 21:45.218
Look, Sarah, don't freak out.Okay?

21:45.219 --> 21:47.143
Mom told me none of this is true.

21:47.144 --> 21:49.206
Just hear her out before...

21:49.207 --> 21:50.794
Before I what?
Go jumping to the conclusion

21:50.795 --> 21:53.039
that perhaps my father is
not actually my father?

21:53.040 --> 21:54.078
Are you happy, rose?

21:54.079 --> 21:56.336
You're the reason she's
taking this seriously.

21:56.337 --> 21:58.099
Me? You're the one who told her.

21:58.100 --> 21:59.319
Can you just go
upstairs and start...

21:59.320 --> 22:01.180
If you think I'm gonna
go get all dolled up

22:01.181 --> 22:03.682
for some romantic dinner, you
need to have your head checked.

22:03.683 --> 22:06.549
I do not feel very Valentine's-y.

22:09.691 --> 22:10.826
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

22:10.827 --> 22:14.527
I'm sure there's some stupid
explanation about all this.

22:14.528 --> 22:16.421
Come on. Why would dad not
sign my birth certificate

22:16.422 --> 22:18.030
on the night that I was born?

22:18.031 --> 22:19.609
Look, I don't know.

22:19.610 --> 22:21.213
But I'm sure mom does.

22:21.214 --> 22:24.789
And we're all gonna feel like
a bunch of asses. Trust me.

22:24.975 --> 22:26.053
Where are you going?

22:26.054 --> 22:27.440
You shouldn't be alone right now.

22:27.441 --> 22:28.810
Fine. Then get in the car.

22:28.811 --> 22:31.087
Where are we going?

22:43.926 --> 22:45.430
What are you guys doing here?

22:45.487 --> 22:46.679
Where's Luc?

22:46.680 --> 22:49.324
Where's Luc? Probably home,
trying not to cry.

22:49.325 --> 22:51.424
He said you two were bowling.

22:51.425 --> 22:52.954
Yeah, that's called a cover.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.140
I mean, he left as soon as
you hung up the phone. What?

22:55.141 --> 22:57.300
Poor guy spent all day cooking
you this big fancy thing,

22:57.301 --> 22:59.249
and... and you left him for work?

22:59.250 --> 23:00.555
You broke his little French heart.

23:00.556 --> 23:01.938
Oh, damn it.

23:01.939 --> 23:03.701
I'll have to call him after this.

23:03.702 --> 23:04.851
After what?

23:04.852 --> 23:07.332
- Ah, there's Kevin. He'll be here in a few minutes.
- Good.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.575
You guys made Kevin come
home from his lawyerfest?

23:09.576 --> 23:11.561
What the hell is going on?
Is this an intervention?

23:11.562 --> 23:12.985
Guys, I'm allowed
to eat cheese fries.

23:12.986 --> 23:15.386
Justin, we need you to be serious.

23:15.491 --> 23:17.192
We've got something to tell you.

23:17.193 --> 23:18.831
- What is it?
- It's nothing.

23:18.832 --> 23:20.668
What's nothing?
What the hell is going on here?

23:20.669 --> 23:23.369
I convened an emergency
family meeting. Why?

23:24.108 --> 23:26.240
Wait. You're telling me mom's
gonna come to a bowling alley?

23:26.241 --> 23:28.001
No, mom's not coming.

23:28.002 --> 23:29.510
It's about her.

23:29.511 --> 23:31.323
About mom?

23:36.750 --> 23:38.692
More. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

23:38.693 --> 23:41.291
So, Scotty, these are the entrÃ©es
for Jonathan's table, right?

23:41.292 --> 23:42.228
Yes.

23:42.229 --> 23:45.856
Okay, so we have sole bercy
with chanterelle mushrooms...

23:45.857 --> 23:48.445
in a shrimp veloutÃ©.
In a shrimp veloutÃ©. That's great.

23:49.766 --> 23:51.813
Uh-oh. Shrimp?

23:51.814 --> 23:53.669
Yes. Shrimp stock.
Why? What's the matter?

23:53.670 --> 23:55.982
Well, Jonathan's mildly
allergic to shrimp.

23:55.983 --> 23:57.531
What? What does that mean, mildly?

23:57.532 --> 23:59.130
Mildly. It means that it's
gonna be perfectly fine.

23:59.131 --> 24:01.047
It's shrimp stock.
It's not the whole shrimp.

24:01.048 --> 24:02.792
No, we can't serve
him the sole, Saul.

24:02.793 --> 24:05.407
We have to serve him the sole,
Scotty. He ordered it.

24:05.408 --> 24:07.347
If we don't serve it to him,
then... then Lemonde will know

24:07.348 --> 24:08.771
that I know Jonathan
well enough to know

24:08.772 --> 24:10.879
that he's allergic to shrimp,
the whole plan will just...

24:10.880 --> 24:12.224
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

24:12.225 --> 24:13.771
Because a great review
from Lemonde means that

24:13.772 --> 24:15.364
we'll be booked solid
every night.That's why.

24:15.365 --> 24:16.353
Well, what do you want me to do?

24:16.354 --> 24:18.197
Because I'm not serving shrimp
to somebody who's allergic to...

24:18.198 --> 24:21.445
Fine, fine, fine. It's simple.

24:21.446 --> 24:23.452
I deliver the entrÃ©e,
I describe the entrÃ©e,

24:23.453 --> 24:25.962
Jonathan hears "shrimp,
" he says he's allergic to it,

24:25.963 --> 24:27.313
and then I bring him
the other choice.

24:27.314 --> 24:29.664
Great.Great. I'll start
on the other entrÃ©es.

24:29.986 --> 24:31.010
Saul. What?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.257
Does it seem like they're
having a good time?

24:32.258 --> 24:35.679
Oh, it seems like they're having
a perfectly wonderful time.

24:35.831 --> 24:37.937
It's an all-expense-paid
trip to St. Barths

24:37.938 --> 24:40.952
just to review this
resort's one restaurant.

24:40.953 --> 24:42.174
You really couldn't get away?

24:42.175 --> 24:44.046
Oh, Edward. I don't know. I...

24:46.563 --> 24:47.661
Actually,

24:47.662 --> 24:50.766
St. Barths is one of my favorite's
of the Caribbean islands.

24:51.439 --> 24:54.428
Uh, twist my arm, and, uh,

24:54.429 --> 24:56.275
I may have to cancel
my plans and join you.

24:56.276 --> 24:57.997
Wonderful. I'll look
into the details.

24:57.998 --> 25:00.874
Excuse me, gentlemen. If I may
interrupt your itinerary planning

25:00.875 --> 25:02.897
long enough just to
present your dinners.

25:02.898 --> 25:04.145
Please do.

25:05.879 --> 25:09.365
So we have a fillet of sole
bercy with chanterelle...

25:09.366 --> 25:12.702
You know, I do love St. Barths.

25:16.201 --> 25:18.673
Oh, sorry. Do go on.

25:18.674 --> 25:23.012
Yes, a fillet of sole bercy with
chanterelle mushrooms in a...

25:24.100 --> 25:27.682
Lovely veloutÃ©.

25:27.683 --> 25:28.631
Ah.

25:29.145 --> 25:29.875
Enjoy.

25:29.876 --> 25:31.411
Thank you.

25:32.775 --> 25:35.255
Bon appÃ©tit. Thank you.

25:44.547 --> 25:45.854
Have you lost your mind?

25:45.855 --> 25:46.913
I'm sorry. I'm done.

25:46.914 --> 25:48.106
Could you please let
me out of this thing?

25:48.107 --> 25:49.253
No, Kevin, Kevin,
you're not going anywhere.

25:49.254 --> 25:50.825
That's why you're on the inside.

25:50.826 --> 25:53.073
Yeah, kev, and your
head looks weird.

25:53.074 --> 25:54.700
You shouldn't be driving. It does.

25:55.217 --> 25:58.228
My head looks weird because
I've been on standby

25:58.229 --> 26:00.025
at Orlando airport since 6:00 A.M.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.869
Trying to fly home to
surprise my husband.

26:01.870 --> 26:04.098
Now that I'm finally minutes away,
I get summoned

26:04.099 --> 26:08.646
to the most inane family meeting
in the history of the walkers.

26:08.647 --> 26:09.620
Sarah. You gotta let this go.

26:09.621 --> 26:11.380
I mean, going all
D.N.A. in this family?

26:11.381 --> 26:12.898
Trust me. Don't do it.

26:12.899 --> 26:14.473
The kid's right.
Can we please leave?

26:14.474 --> 26:15.806
No, Kevin.

26:15.807 --> 26:19.112
I'm not gonna let you all
jump on the mom bandwagon

26:19.113 --> 26:21.464
and push this thing under the rug.

26:21.465 --> 26:24.949
Dad did not sign my
birth certificate.

26:24.950 --> 26:26.863
So what, now he's not your father?

26:26.864 --> 26:28.278
He could've been away on business.

26:28.279 --> 26:29.321
Sarah, it's the '60s.

26:29.322 --> 26:30.581
He could've been passed
out in the waiting room

26:30.582 --> 26:32.126
with a cigar hanging
out of his mouth.

26:32.127 --> 26:33.950
Guys, look, obviously,
she's not gonna stop.

26:33.951 --> 26:35.790
Can we all agree,
she should just speak to mom?

26:35.791 --> 26:37.993
I get it, Tommy.
You want me to believe mom

26:37.994 --> 26:39.506
so that she'll let
rose off the hook

26:39.507 --> 26:40.898
for the bringing
this whole thing up.

26:40.899 --> 26:41.975
Oh, and you'd hate that.

26:41.976 --> 26:44.098
Oh, shut up, Tommy.
I am so done with you today.

26:44.099 --> 26:45.320
Well, what are you gonna do,
fire me?

26:45.321 --> 26:46.725
Guys. We're not at work.

26:46.726 --> 26:48.263
Sarah, you're overreacting.

26:48.264 --> 26:49.574
I'm done with you, too, Kevin.

26:49.575 --> 26:50.824
Great. Can I leave now? No!

26:50.825 --> 26:53.962
Let the poor guy go, man.
He's got airport head.

26:54.369 --> 26:57.244
Look, Sarah, we all agree.
It's nothing.

26:57.245 --> 26:59.303
No, no, no, no.
It's not nothing, Tommy.

26:59.304 --> 27:01.045
It is something,
and how about a little bit of,

27:01.046 --> 27:04.584
"yeah, Sarah's freaking out,
and she has every right to be,

27:04.585 --> 27:07.252
and we are all there
supporting her"?

27:08.025 --> 27:09.494
God, I-if Kitty was here,

27:09.495 --> 27:11.528
at least I would have
someone on my side.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.298
Yeah, her and her other dad.

27:14.478 --> 27:15.807
Oh, I'm kidding.

27:16.062 --> 27:17.182
Where are you going?

27:17.183 --> 27:18.202
What does it matter, Tommy?

27:18.203 --> 27:19.511
Obviously,
this is not your concern.

27:19.512 --> 27:21.099
It's none of your concern.

27:31.216 --> 27:33.986
We should go back to that
bistro in Santa Barbara.

27:33.987 --> 27:35.863
Yes. Remember?

27:36.237 --> 27:38.026
Just you and me,

27:38.048 --> 27:39.834
balmy nights,

27:39.835 --> 27:42.200
the moon on the water.

27:42.201 --> 27:44.447
Speaking of water,
I could use some.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.932
Waiter. May I have
some water, please?

27:48.738 --> 27:50.744
Are you all right,
Jonathan? You look a bit flushed.

27:50.745 --> 27:52.846
No, I'm... I'm...
I'm fine. I'm fine.

27:52.847 --> 27:56.264
What did you say our entrÃ©e was?
It was so delicious.

27:56.265 --> 27:58.174
The entrÃ©e... was it delicious? Oh, great.

27:58.175 --> 27:59.791
It was a fillet of sole bercy

27:59.792 --> 28:02.093
with, uh, chanterelle
mushrooms and, uh...

28:02.094 --> 28:04.601
Mm. But what was in the sauce? The sauce?

28:04.602 --> 28:05.999
Yes.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.748
Fish. Oh.

28:07.749 --> 28:10.566
I believe I detected shrimp.

28:10.567 --> 28:11.449
Shrimp?

28:11.450 --> 28:14.470
Oh. I know my shrimp when
I taste it. Am I right?

28:15.890 --> 28:18.872
Well, the... the...
the... the veloutÃ©...

28:18.873 --> 28:24.347
The veloutÃ© was of a...
shrimpish nature.

28:24.348 --> 28:25.153
Oh.

28:25.154 --> 28:27.373
Do you have a problem with shrimp?

28:28.809 --> 28:31.185
No, no, no.

28:31.186 --> 28:33.548
I love shrimp.

28:33.549 --> 28:36.758
Oh, the sauce was so delicious,

28:36.759 --> 28:39.779
I practically licked my plate.

28:39.780 --> 28:41.239
Ah...

28:42.062 --> 28:46.497
Funny. I never noticed how...
sexy your voice is.

28:46.498 --> 28:49.007
Well, I-I will certainly pay
your compliments to the chef.

28:49.008 --> 28:50.733
Please do.

28:52.196 --> 28:54.103
Table nine. Got it.

28:54.104 --> 28:58.215
It's 2 for table 14.

28:58.574 --> 29:00.777
Hey, how's it going?
Is everything all right?

29:00.778 --> 29:02.256
Oh, yes. I just have
to get their desserts.

29:02.257 --> 29:03.381
Everything is gonna be fine.

29:03.382 --> 29:06.382
It's gonna be fine? Why? What...
what's going on?

29:06.383 --> 29:09.608
Jonathan is just feeling a
little warm. That's all.

29:09.744 --> 29:11.446
Warm? He looks like he's sweating.

29:11.447 --> 29:14.934
Ah, yes. This is gonna fix it.
This'll be great.

29:15.375 --> 29:18.356
You did tell him there was
shrimp in the veloutÃ©, right?

29:18.901 --> 29:20.448
Saul.

29:20.991 --> 29:22.088
Not in so many words.

29:22.089 --> 29:23.481
In any words?

29:23.482 --> 29:24.456
No.

29:24.457 --> 29:26.656
Oh, my God. Well,
it's not such a big deal.

29:26.657 --> 29:28.113
He just said he
felt a little warm.

29:28.114 --> 29:30.720
His throat is constricting,
but on the plus side...

29:30.721 --> 29:32.654
They loved the sole.

29:32.655 --> 29:34.196
This is a nightmare.

29:34.197 --> 29:35.987
He's gonna be fine.
Wait till you see.

29:35.988 --> 29:38.453
The sugar in the cake is
gonna counteract the shrimp.

29:38.454 --> 29:39.935
Oh, is that true?

29:39.936 --> 29:40.946
I don't know.

29:40.947 --> 29:41.885
What were you thinking?

29:41.886 --> 29:43.974
I wasn't thinking.

29:43.975 --> 29:45.602
They're out there having
fun at my expense.

29:45.603 --> 29:47.020
Do you know they're planning
on going on vacation?

29:47.021 --> 29:48.864
I don't care. This was
about a good review.

29:48.865 --> 29:50.386
You're both acting like teenagers.

29:50.387 --> 29:51.657
He started it!

29:51.658 --> 29:53.741
And you're gonna end it by putting
him into anaphylactic shock?

29:53.742 --> 29:55.143
I'm not gonna put him
into any kind of shock.

29:55.144 --> 29:57.309
If he goes into shock, there's
an epipen in the first aid kit,

29:57.310 --> 29:59.588
and I will apply it.
You need to calm down.

29:59.589 --> 30:01.642
He's probably out there talking
about the food right now.

30:01.575 --> 30:03.276
Talking? Sure,
if he can still talk.

30:03.277 --> 30:05.547
He's fine. They're fine.

30:07.561 --> 30:10.277
They're gone. Thanks a lot.

30:12.452 --> 30:13.746
Sarah, please.

30:13.747 --> 30:15.722
Would you just sit down? No.

30:17.175 --> 30:18.951
Honey, listen.

30:18.952 --> 30:20.670
Understand, back in those days,

30:20.671 --> 30:22.776
if you got pregnant and
you weren't married,

30:22.777 --> 30:25.197
it was a very big deal.
I mean, the neighbors

30:25.198 --> 30:27.230
would hold a press
conference for God sakes.

30:27.231 --> 30:29.796
Mom, I'm not here to
discuss your wedding date.

30:29.797 --> 30:32.015
All right, yes. I-I lied to you.

30:32.016 --> 30:34.003
I lied to you because I wanted you

30:34.004 --> 30:36.303
to never have a
doubt in your mind.

30:36.304 --> 30:38.239
Your father and I
loved each other...

30:38.240 --> 30:41.126
Did you sleep with
this Brody guy or not?

30:43.611 --> 30:45.195
Yes. Once.

30:48.554 --> 30:49.729
When?

30:50.560 --> 30:52.946
I don't remember. Mom,
was it around the time that I was...

30:52.947 --> 30:55.890
Yes. Oh, my God.
This is... this is not happening.

30:55.891 --> 30:57.325
This is who you were
talking about on the radio

30:57.326 --> 30:59.801
this morning, wasn't it,
the one that got away?

31:00.332 --> 31:02.271
That was Brody. You think he...

31:02.272 --> 31:04.138
You think he might be my... No.

31:04.139 --> 31:06.738
Sarah, no.

31:07.767 --> 31:10.354
Listen to me.
The only reason your father

31:10.355 --> 31:12.676
didn't sign your birth
certificate that night

31:12.677 --> 31:15.923
was because he was worried that
maybe you weren't his daughter.

31:15.924 --> 31:17.495
And what made him change his mind?

31:17.496 --> 31:19.622
Because they had a blood test.

31:20.618 --> 31:24.328
They both took a
blood test, Sarah.

31:25.048 --> 31:27.140
Brody was o negative,

31:27.141 --> 31:28.717
which ruled him out
since you're...

31:28.718 --> 31:31.159
AB. AB, yes.

31:35.039 --> 31:37.011
And what color are his eyes?

31:37.012 --> 31:39.188
My God. You don't believe me.

31:39.189 --> 31:41.390
I don't know, mom. I know
that you're capable of lying

31:41.391 --> 31:42.572
to protect the people you love.

31:42.573 --> 31:45.884
What color are his eyes?
I don't remember.

31:45.885 --> 31:47.677
Why don't you go find
out for yourself?

31:47.678 --> 31:49.928
No, better yet, why don't
you go have a d.N.A. Test?

31:49.929 --> 31:51.451
Then you can find
out all the facts.

31:51.452 --> 31:53.449
And when you know them
and you know the truth,

31:53.450 --> 31:56.087
you come back here and
you apologize to me,

31:56.088 --> 31:57.999
because I'll deserve it.

32:16.564 --> 32:18.203
Do you believe her?

32:18.557 --> 32:20.175
I have no reason not to.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.052
But I understand,
it's not simple for you.

32:23.781 --> 32:26.163
If you want to find this
man and talk to him,

32:26.617 --> 32:28.215
that's what you should do.

32:28.603 --> 32:29.656
Mm.

32:30.388 --> 32:31.304
God. Thank you.

32:31.305 --> 32:33.002
I feel like you're
the first person

32:33.003 --> 32:34.905
to listen to me all day.

32:35.292 --> 32:37.401
I'd love to listen to
you and I will help you

32:38.368 --> 32:39.935
if you let me in.

32:40.931 --> 32:42.604
What are you talking about?

32:42.794 --> 32:44.630
You know how nuts I was today,

32:44.911 --> 32:46.773
trying to plan this amazing night?

32:48.327 --> 32:48.938
I don't understand

32:48.939 --> 32:50.900
why you didn't tell
me what was going on.

32:50.901 --> 32:53.312
Well, you left the bowling
alley before I had a chance to.

32:53.313 --> 32:56.186
No, Sarah, before,
when you first heard.

32:56.187 --> 32:58.803
You told me it was work. Come on.
It was pretty hard to explain.

32:58.804 --> 33:01.490
My head was spinning.
How could I help you

33:01.491 --> 33:04.328
if I don't know a single
thing you do all day long?

33:05.286 --> 33:06.950
You mean like work stuff?

33:06.951 --> 33:10.159
Mm-hmm. I'm your partner.

33:10.160 --> 33:11.783
I don't want you to shut me out.

33:12.539 --> 33:14.281
You really feel I shut you out?

33:14.282 --> 33:17.371
Yeah. That's why I was trying
to plan this amazing evening.

33:18.203 --> 33:20.050
I need to find a way back in.

33:22.357 --> 33:25.150
Luc, I-I'm really sorry.
I had no idea.

33:25.930 --> 33:28.012
I don't want to shut you out.

33:28.013 --> 33:29.494
I want to share.

33:30.530 --> 33:34.976
Okay, I will talk about
the most boring, tedious,

33:35.358 --> 33:38.802
dull work stuff that
I can possibly find.

33:38.803 --> 33:40.382
In fact, I would like to do that,

33:40.383 --> 33:42.285
because right now,
it would be a great distraction

33:42.286 --> 33:44.420
for the day I just had.

33:47.361 --> 33:48.891
It's gonna be okay.

33:49.409 --> 33:50.555
Thank you.

33:55.392 --> 33:58.180
I want to believe mom.
I really do.

34:12.844 --> 34:14.788
I thought maybe you were Sarah.

34:16.464 --> 34:17.539
Sorry.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.193
I'm sure I'm the last person
you want to see right now.

34:21.300 --> 34:22.399
One of 'em.

34:23.803 --> 34:25.965
It's this damn family tree.

34:26.902 --> 34:27.900
It's done.

34:27.902 --> 34:30.659
There it is. You can
burn it for all I care.

34:31.150 --> 34:33.021
Just try to understand

34:33.022 --> 34:35.589
that I never wanted to
cause all this strife.

34:35.978 --> 34:38.228
What did you want?

34:38.561 --> 34:40.348
No good would ever come of it.

34:40.349 --> 34:43.321
Can you imagine what would've
happened had this been true?

34:43.871 --> 34:47.362
I'm sorry. You had no right
to dig into my family's past

34:47.362 --> 34:49.687
to satisfy your own curiosity.

34:50.034 --> 34:52.681
Here. Thanks.

34:52.681 --> 34:55.246
And let me tell you,
you can't bring this family down.

34:55.248 --> 34:57.251
We've been through a lot worse,
and we're still here.

34:57.252 --> 34:59.977
We're screaming at each other,
but we're still here.

35:01.833 --> 35:03.479
I feel terrible.

35:04.076 --> 35:05.474
Well, good.

35:08.995 --> 35:10.720
I don't know what to do.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.602
Why don't you do what we all do?

35:12.826 --> 35:15.230
Have a glass of wine and
wait for the dust to settle.

35:15.231 --> 35:16.820
And if you're gonna be
part of this family,

35:16.821 --> 35:19.103
you need to learn to get over it.

35:19.104 --> 35:20.900
Stop crying.

35:22.759 --> 35:23.884
Okay.

35:26.050 --> 35:27.006
So...

35:28.306 --> 35:30.307
It all comes down
to this question...

35:32.350 --> 35:33.816
Red or white?

35:35.366 --> 35:36.513
Red.

35:48.662 --> 35:49.865
Jonathan.

35:50.707 --> 35:51.818
Is Scotty here?

35:51.819 --> 35:54.207
No. Yeah, he's upstairs.

35:54.208 --> 35:55.634
Kevin came back.
He wasn't supposed to...

35:55.635 --> 35:57.605
Yes or no is all I need.

35:59.155 --> 36:00.491
Yeah, yeah,

36:00.951 --> 36:02.162
he's here.

36:02.266 --> 36:04.783
Tell him it's my fault
that we left so abruptly.

36:05.950 --> 36:08.131
I had to get out or
stay and make a scene.

36:08.132 --> 36:10.355
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

36:10.356 --> 36:12.961
Nothing a little
antihistamine wouldn't fix.

36:13.325 --> 36:16.326
That's not the scene
I'm talking about.

36:17.202 --> 36:19.822
Tell Scotty that Edward's
coming back another night.

36:19.823 --> 36:21.832
Great, great.

36:21.924 --> 36:25.551
I, for one, will, uh,
not be returning anytime soon.

36:25.552 --> 36:29.138
Jonathan, wait. Wait.
Please. Come on. Please.

36:29.383 --> 36:32.152
It was so stupid and
childish and thoughtless,

36:32.153 --> 36:33.100
this whole thing.

36:33.101 --> 36:37.039
I-I-I-I think that I
literally lost my mind.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.650
Why? That's all I want to know.

36:39.651 --> 36:41.636
Just listen to me, okay?

36:44.572 --> 36:47.801
You make me feel insecure.
Can you understand that?

36:48.481 --> 36:49.928
I make you feel insecure?

36:49.929 --> 36:50.638
Yeah.

36:50.707 --> 36:53.289
I wasted almost 20
years of my life drunk.

36:53.290 --> 36:54.438
Jonathan, listen to me.

36:54.439 --> 36:56.817
You make me feel insecure.
I can't help it.

36:57.454 --> 36:59.096
That's the way it is,
and then tonight,

36:59.097 --> 37:01.461
I see you with that
loathsome man...

37:01.462 --> 37:03.134
I told you,
he doesn't interest me.

37:03.135 --> 37:04.663
But I didn't believe you.

37:06.072 --> 37:08.405
And suddenly it feels like
it's the '80s again...

37:08.406 --> 37:10.023
All those people who lined up

37:10.024 --> 37:12.288
waiting to spend some
time with you, remember?

37:12.469 --> 37:15.432
You know, somehow
I actually thought

37:15.758 --> 37:19.278
we had put our past behind us.

37:19.279 --> 37:20.940
I'm trying. You're trying.

37:20.941 --> 37:23.365
We're both trying to
understand our lives.

37:23.366 --> 37:25.776
If we could live them over again,
maybe we would...

37:25.777 --> 37:28.486
Try to make them differently, yes.

37:28.487 --> 37:29.511
Maybe.

37:34.090 --> 37:35.696
I behaved like a...

37:36.374 --> 37:38.352
Like an ass tonight, too.

37:39.160 --> 37:41.762
God, we could've been in
high school tonight, right?

37:43.873 --> 37:44.839
Oh.

37:45.700 --> 37:49.255
Probably explains why
this man that I slept with

37:49.256 --> 37:50.215
all those years ago

37:50.216 --> 37:52.772
who doesn't even remember
that it happened,

37:53.091 --> 37:55.050
who probably gave me h.I.V.,

37:55.659 --> 37:58.870
is the only man that
I'm interested in now.

37:59.956 --> 38:01.049
Well...

38:02.495 --> 38:05.002
Hard as it is for
you to believe...

38:06.235 --> 38:09.488
You're the one I'm most
interested in, too.

38:09.897 --> 38:12.496
Oh, God. Well,
why didn't you say something?

38:12.497 --> 38:13.876
I'm sorry,

38:14.130 --> 38:18.069
but... we all are afraid

38:18.070 --> 38:20.099
of taking the first step.

38:20.450 --> 38:21.699
Yeah.

38:22.224 --> 38:24.027
Which probably explains

38:25.571 --> 38:27.918
why I've never done this before.

38:44.718 --> 38:46.847
Wait. Where are you...
Where are you going?

38:46.848 --> 38:49.791
I'm power walking to my car,
and then I'm driving home.

38:51.578 --> 38:52.991
Care to join me?

38:53.478 --> 38:54.873
Oh, yeah.

39:12.402 --> 39:15.643
Hey. Where, uh, where's mom?

39:15.644 --> 39:16.688
Upstairs.

39:16.689 --> 39:18.526
She finally called it a day.

39:18.527 --> 39:21.337
Not before we put
away a bottle of wine

39:21.338 --> 39:23.630
and taught me to bake
your favorite cookies.

39:23.752 --> 39:25.413
B-but what'd you say to her?

39:25.414 --> 39:28.558
Not much. She did
most of the talking.

39:28.559 --> 39:29.526
Yeah.

39:30.029 --> 39:31.701
She's quite a woman, huh?

39:33.062 --> 39:35.595
Did... did she say
anything about Brody?

39:35.871 --> 39:36.784
We were wrong.

39:36.785 --> 39:38.190
Yeah, I know.

39:40.191 --> 39:42.127
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:45.110 --> 39:46.334
Here.

39:48.596 --> 39:51.421
Your mom said that you
used to lick the frosting

39:51.422 --> 39:53.192
and then eat the cookie.

39:53.425 --> 39:55.825
Yeah. When I was 10.

39:55.826 --> 39:56.778
Oh.

39:57.496 --> 40:00.389
Well... happy Valentine's Day.

40:01.133 --> 40:02.799
You, too.

40:14.525 --> 40:16.299
Scotty, this is delicious.

40:16.300 --> 40:18.955
I am so glad you came home.

40:19.179 --> 40:21.649
I wasn't gonna miss
Valentine's with you.

40:21.650 --> 40:23.175
I love you. Mwah.

40:23.176 --> 40:24.554
I love you.

40:29.262 --> 40:30.531
What's wrong?

40:31.912 --> 40:34.861
Is this the entre with the shrimp?
Oh, screw you.

40:34.862 --> 40:36.615
I think I'm dying. Fine. Go ahead.

40:36.616 --> 40:39.844
I want you to have my
Olivia Newton-John...

40:40.052 --> 40:41.745
Action figure.

40:44.354 --> 40:45.104
I'm sorry.

40:45.105 --> 40:48.492
I was just trying to...
lighten things up about Saul.

40:50.838 --> 40:52.519
You know, people make mistakes,

40:52.520 --> 40:54.087
especially when it comes to love.

40:54.278 --> 40:56.006
Oh, come on. Do you
really think he's in love?

40:56.007 --> 40:58.610
Yeah, in his own peculiar way.

41:00.518 --> 41:02.338
You should forgive him, Scotty.

41:03.831 --> 41:06.329
Well, people have forgiven
me in the past, so...

41:10.462 --> 41:12.074
I'm glad I came home.

41:12.717 --> 41:13.940
Me, too.

41:17.624 --> 41:19.433
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:20.904 --> 41:22.551
Happy Valentine's Day.

41:26.072 --> 41:28.919
Yesterday, I, Nora Walker,

41:28.920 --> 41:31.011
your own dear mom,

41:31.012 --> 41:34.613
found herself
slandering a holiday.

41:34.805 --> 41:37.121
Yes, it was not my finest moment.

41:37.122 --> 41:38.342
But the good news is,

41:38.343 --> 41:41.159
there's always time
for a thought on love.

41:41.522 --> 41:44.363
Look, the thing is,
about the one that got away...

41:44.364 --> 41:46.501
If he was meant to
be in your life,

41:46.502 --> 41:48.755
then he would have found
his way back to you.

41:48.994 --> 41:52.564
So you moved on.
You chose a different road.

41:52.565 --> 41:54.900
Good. Keep your eyes on that.

41:55.101 --> 41:57.215
If you're always looking
in the rearview mirror,

41:57.216 --> 41:59.345
you're gonna miss the
turn you need to make

41:59.346 --> 42:00.348
in the road ahead of you.

42:00.349 --> 42:03.714
And believe me, there's always
plenty of road ahead of you.

42:03.935 --> 42:05.545
Focus on that.

42:05.818 --> 42:08.207
So till the next time,
this is Nora Walker,

42:08.208 --> 42:11.283
reminding you,
mom is always here to listen.

42:19.142 --> 42:22.582
Oh. You must have snuck
in while I snuck out.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.499
The skip's just
wrapping up a meeting.

42:26.029 --> 42:27.673
Who should I say is asking?

42:27.992 --> 42:29.584
Sarah Walker.

42:31.077 --> 42:33.338
Tell him I'm Nora's daughter.

42:34.081 --> 42:35.167
Okay.
