00:02.535 --> 00:03.661
Last time
on Star Trek: Voyager...

00:03.737 --> 00:06.035
You are resilient prey.

00:06.106 --> 00:08.164
l'm no one's prey!

00:10.210 --> 00:11.370
She'll survive.

00:11.444 --> 00:13.469
What about her neural interface?

00:13.580 --> 00:14.740
Stable.

00:14.814 --> 00:17.408
Shall l return her
to the Klingon simulation?

00:17.484 --> 00:18.473
No.

00:18.551 --> 00:20.712
Bring her to Holodeck 1.

00:20.787 --> 00:23.085
l've found another program
l want to try.

00:23.156 --> 00:28.492
Here in your arms this way...

00:28.561 --> 00:29.493
l'm Katrine.

00:29.562 --> 00:31.587
Le Coeur de Lion
is my establishment.

00:31.664 --> 00:33.131
The commandant would have us

00:33.199 --> 00:35.292
continue this simulation
until we rot.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.131
lt's pointless.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.397
We should begin the hunt.

00:38.471 --> 00:40.871
We've been able to expand
both holodeck grids

00:40.940 --> 00:42.703
by 5, 000 square meters.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.004
More.

00:44.077 --> 00:46.568
The colonel is
in a strange mood today.

00:53.319 --> 00:55.514
l have found a way
to disable the interface

00:55.588 --> 00:57.419
by remodulating
one of your Borg implants

00:57.490 --> 00:59.481
to emit a jamming signal.

00:59.559 --> 01:01.288
You circumvented our control!

01:01.361 --> 01:02.419
How?

01:02.495 --> 01:04.429
You're sending a message
to the Nazis.

01:04.497 --> 01:05.394
No.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.558
Step away or l'll kill you.

01:10.570 --> 01:12.037
Need a hand, buddy?

01:12.105 --> 01:14.096
Captain Miller,
Fifth Armored lnfantry.

01:14.174 --> 01:15.903
Welcome to Sainte Claire.

01:15.975 --> 01:17.067
This building
is being targeted.

01:17.143 --> 01:18.075
Let's get out of here.

01:21.181 --> 01:22.443
You wanted a war?

01:22.515 --> 01:24.642
Looks like you've got one.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.810
And now the conclusion.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.274 --> 01:50.003
Looks like the Hirogen
have been busy.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.668
This entire section
has been equipped

01:51.744 --> 01:52.676
with holo- emitters.

01:52.745 --> 01:54.178
Let's get to Astrometrics.

02:04.924 --> 02:06.824
There are 85 Hirogen on board

02:06.893 --> 02:09.258
concentrated
on Decks 2 through 9.

02:09.329 --> 02:10.523
What about the Bridge?

02:11.531 --> 02:14.261
Four Hirogen and Ensign Kim.

02:14.334 --> 02:15.665
At least he's alive.

02:15.735 --> 02:16.702
The neural interfaces--

02:16.769 --> 02:18.396
you said they're controlled
through Sick Bay.

02:18.471 --> 02:21.304
Yes. There's only one
Hirogen in Sick Bay

02:21.374 --> 02:23.672
with the Doctor,
but the corridors

02:23.743 --> 02:24.835
outside are heavily guarded.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.674
That's our first objective--
disable the interfaces--

02:26.746 --> 02:28.077
but we'll need help.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.878
We did have allies in the
World War ll simulation--

02:30.950 --> 02:31.917
the French Resistance.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.818
lt's time we mount
a resistance of our own.

04:28.635 --> 04:31.934
The battle is concentrated
here in Holodeck 1,

04:32.005 --> 04:34.405
but the fighting has spilled
out onto Decks 5 and 6.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.374
And it looks like a group
of holographic Americans

04:36.442 --> 04:37.374
is invading Deck 7.

04:37.443 --> 04:39.843
Show me the breach
in the hologrid.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.943
l've lost the visual link.

04:43.016 --> 04:44.278
lt was the last active circuit

04:44.350 --> 04:45.977
connecting the Bridge
to the holodecks.

04:46.052 --> 04:48.486
There's only one way
to stop this.

04:48.588 --> 04:51.386
l need to go to Engineering
and initiate a power surge

04:51.457 --> 04:52.822
across the holo- emitter network.

04:52.892 --> 04:54.086
lt'll blow out
the entire system.

04:54.160 --> 04:56.287
No. That would destroy
both the holodecks.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.331
Look, simulation or not,
if this battle keeps going

04:59.399 --> 05:00.661
we could all be killed.

05:00.733 --> 05:03.964
l want that technology
preserved.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.561
Commander.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.662
Status.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.331
l was able to reach Deck 5,

05:08.408 --> 05:11.241
but holographic forces
are massing near the breach.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.108
lf l'm to get into the holodeck,
l'll need help.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.579
Take the hunters
from the Klingon simulation.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.708
When l find Captain Janeway,
should l kill her?

05:18.785 --> 05:20.047
No.

05:20.119 --> 05:21.780
Bring her to me.

05:21.854 --> 05:24.015
This is no longer a game.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.421
This hunt is real.

05:25.491 --> 05:26.856
We should kill the prey.

05:26.926 --> 05:31.522
The Voyager crew must
remain alive to make repairs

05:31.597 --> 05:33.997
or we could lose everything--

05:34.067 --> 05:36.331
this vessel, its technology.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.870
You said that you understood
the importance

05:38.938 --> 05:40.803
of what we're doing here.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.242
l'll get the hunters.

05:51.617 --> 05:53.585
We think it's a secret compound
the Nazis built

05:53.653 --> 05:55.211
after they took over the city.

05:55.288 --> 05:56.448
What l don't understand

05:56.522 --> 05:58.683
is how they managed
to camouflage it so well.

05:58.758 --> 05:59.747
lndeed.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.316
We've been scrutinizing
German troop movements

06:01.427 --> 06:02.917
since the occupation.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.361
We knew nothing
of this installation.

06:04.464 --> 06:05.488
Don't sweat it.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.760
Our recon planes missed it, too.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.325
Any idea what they're
hiding in there, Captain?

06:10.403 --> 06:13.770
We saw all sorts of scientific
equipment-- strange metals,

06:13.840 --> 06:15.603
instruments we can't identify.

06:15.675 --> 06:18.007
l've relayed the findings
to Military lntelligence.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.009
They believe this

06:19.078 --> 06:21.342
could be an advanced
munitions laboratory

06:21.414 --> 06:23.314
designed to build
some kind of superweapon.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.748
We've got to put it
out of business.

06:24.817 --> 06:26.148
l've already sent
three squads in,

06:26.219 --> 06:28.414
but the Nazis are putting up
one hell of a fight.

06:28.488 --> 06:29.955
l've requested
additional troops.

06:30.022 --> 06:31.990
Lieutenant,
this restaurant will serve

06:32.058 --> 06:33.423
as our command post.

06:33.493 --> 06:34.653
Set up the transmitter

06:34.727 --> 06:35.921
and post guards
around the perimeter.

06:35.995 --> 06:37.519
Yes, sir.

06:37.597 --> 06:40.589
You've done a bang- up job,
but we'll take it from here.

06:40.666 --> 06:41.963
Tell your people to lie low

06:42.034 --> 06:44.434
and that the Americans
said"thanks."

06:45.505 --> 06:46.472
This is our city.

06:46.539 --> 06:49.337
We have no intention
of lying low.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.341
Listen, honey, the time

06:50.410 --> 06:52.037
for sneaking messages
back and forth is over.

06:52.111 --> 06:54.909
This is war,
and you aren't soldiers.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.642
He's right.

06:56.716 --> 06:59.082
We have weapons hidden
throughout the city.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.585
Brigette will tell
you where they are.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.585
Sounds good.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.815
Lieutenant, take care of it.

07:13.499 --> 07:15.990
l can see you haven't changed.

07:16.068 --> 07:18.502
Bring me one
of those street maps.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.236
Most of the guns, we stole
from the German army.

07:28.314 --> 07:31.044
The explosives, we bought
from the black market.

07:31.117 --> 07:32.709
We could use both.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.515
Our biggest stockpile
is buried here--

07:35.588 --> 07:36.987
two meters beneath
the last row of seats

07:37.056 --> 07:38.421
of the Cinema Mystere.

07:38.524 --> 07:40.856
You remember it, don't you?

07:40.927 --> 07:43.555
Hmm.

07:43.629 --> 07:45.187
l'm No Angel with Mae West.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.198
There's heavy fighting
in that area.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.133
What's the best way in?

07:51.204 --> 07:54.799
We dug a tunnel that leads
directly to the stockpile.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.466
Here. l'll show you.

07:58.611 --> 07:59.976
lncidentally...

08:00.012 --> 08:02.708
we saw Death Takes a Holiday.

08:02.748 --> 08:05.740
lt was the Mae West movie.
l'm sure of it.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.651
She was singing...

08:08.721 --> 08:11.918
"Sister Honky Tonk,"
and l put my arm around you.

08:11.991 --> 08:15.518
And during
the courtroom scene...

08:15.595 --> 08:17.392
l kissed you.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.857
You know, l think you're right.

08:21.934 --> 08:25.370
l guess the experience wasn't
exactly burned into your memory.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.166
Not the movie.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.140
But l do remember the kiss.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.347
So...

08:36.414 --> 08:38.042
did you get my last letter?

08:38.116 --> 08:40.813
You mean the one asking
me to leave France?

08:40.886 --> 08:42.616
Germany was about to invade.

08:42.688 --> 08:46.021
l thought you'd be safer
back in the States...with me.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.624
But...l guess
you found someone else

08:50.696 --> 08:51.924
to take care of you.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.398
There's never been
anybody else.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.434
Then who...?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.800
He's second in command
of the Sainte Claire occupation.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.999
The first time he saw me,
he said l was pretty.

09:02.074 --> 09:03.939
l took advantage
of his interest.

09:04.010 --> 09:08.106
He doesn't know
l'm in the Resistance.

09:08.180 --> 09:09.647
The child is his.

09:12.718 --> 09:14.709
l'm sorry.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.956
So am l.

09:27.533 --> 09:29.228
Hold your fire.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.929
Katrine...

09:31.003 --> 09:32.265
you survived.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.272
Are you surprised?

09:34.340 --> 09:35.272
Very.

09:35.341 --> 09:36.638
Nazi headquarters was destroyed.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.609
We assumed you were killed
in the explosion.

09:38.678 --> 09:39.610
What is that?

09:39.679 --> 09:41.579
Some kind of an escape tunnel?

09:41.647 --> 09:44.582
That's precisely what it is.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.242
You're the leader
of the local Resistance.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.251
That's right.

09:47.320 --> 09:50.312
Captain Miller,
Fifth Armored lnfantry.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.913
This is Lieutenant Davis.

09:51.991 --> 09:54.186
l take it you've seen the
German bunker we uncovered.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.319
l just came from there.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.419
We suspect it's a munitions lab.

09:57.530 --> 09:58.519
Can you confirm that?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.824
Yes. A munitions lab.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.391
Then this is it.

10:03.469 --> 10:04.436
We're calling in an air strike.

10:04.570 --> 10:05.434
Contact the RAF.

10:05.571 --> 10:06.538
Hold on, Captain.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.073
There's an easier way
to do this

10:08.140 --> 10:09.471
with a minimum of casualties.

10:10.576 --> 10:12.976
Let's hear it.

10:13.045 --> 10:15.912
l've located the generator
that powers the entire complex.

10:15.982 --> 10:17.916
lt's heavily guarded,
but with your help,

10:17.984 --> 10:20.179
l can get close enough
to set off some explosives.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.482
My orders are to blow
the entire compound

10:22.555 --> 10:24.182
before the Germans
send in reinforcements.

10:24.256 --> 10:27.487
l saw technology in there
you can't begin to imagine--

10:27.560 --> 10:30.358
warheads powerful enough
to destroy this entire valley

10:30.429 --> 10:32.124
if they're
accidentally detonated.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.597
Call for an air strike,

10:33.666 --> 10:35.463
may be the last call you make.

10:37.837 --> 10:39.395
How can you get close enough?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.133
This tunnel.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.731
l've been watching this compound

10:42.808 --> 10:45.106
for several months,
and l've got a man inside.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.940
The place is crawling
with Krauts.

10:47.013 --> 10:48.537
That's why l need your help.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.674
lf your men can clear
these two corridors,

10:51.751 --> 10:54.015
it'll give us access
to this entryway.

10:54.086 --> 10:56.452
Get me there,
and l can take care of the rest.

10:56.522 --> 10:58.854
"C" Company--
what's their status?

10:58.924 --> 11:02.121
They're holding position
about 200 yards from here.

11:05.264 --> 11:07.357
Get them on the horn.

11:07.433 --> 11:08.695
You'll lead us
into the compound,

11:08.768 --> 11:09.757
but l'm coming with you.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.234
l work better alone.

11:11.303 --> 11:12.793
This isn't a request.
lt's an order.

11:12.872 --> 11:13.839
Order? Do l look

11:13.906 --> 11:15.305
like l'm wearing
one of your uniforms?

11:15.374 --> 11:16.306
l go alone.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.399
l thought you needed our help.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.535
l'll be right behind you.

11:19.612 --> 11:20.806
Lieutenant Blake.

11:20.880 --> 11:22.347
There's been
a change of plans...

11:26.085 --> 11:28.918
Even if l manage to disrupt
the neural interfaces,

11:28.988 --> 11:30.421
we've still got a war to fight.

11:30.489 --> 11:32.889
We're going to need something
a lot more effective

11:32.958 --> 11:34.118
than these old firearms.

11:34.193 --> 11:36.388
l believe l can enhance
these weapons

11:36.462 --> 11:37.793
using Borg technology,
but l'll have

11:37.863 --> 11:39.592
to access Cargo Bay 2.

11:39.665 --> 11:42.691
lf something goes wrong
and l don't succeed,

11:42.768 --> 11:44.201
you'll be the only one left

11:44.270 --> 11:45.999
who knows what's
really going on.

11:46.072 --> 11:47.539
Understood.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.542
Have our suspicions
been confirmed?

11:51.610 --> 11:52.542
Suspicions?

11:52.611 --> 11:56.479
ls she a collaborator?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.039
l think we can trust her.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.778
Are you certain?

11:59.852 --> 12:01.114
Three hours ago,
you were prepared

12:01.220 --> 12:02.346
to put a bullet in her head.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.117
She's on our side.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.987
ln your absence,

12:06.058 --> 12:08.618
l may be forced to make
that determination for myself.

12:08.694 --> 12:10.127
l've already made it.

12:10.196 --> 12:11.185
You're not to harm her.

12:11.263 --> 12:12.787
ls that understood?

12:18.504 --> 12:20.995
German forces are advancing
on our position.

12:22.541 --> 12:24.600
Let's give them a warm welcome.

12:27.613 --> 12:29.376
Mademoiselle, after you.

12:33.753 --> 12:36.051
Punctured lung,
arterial rupture,

12:36.122 --> 12:37.817
fracture of the 13th vertebrae.

12:37.890 --> 12:38.982
He needs surgery.

12:41.026 --> 12:43.961
First- and second- degree burns
to the face and neck.

12:44.029 --> 12:45.018
Treat him.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.029
His injuries are minor.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.030
He can wait.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.498
l said treat him!

12:48.567 --> 12:50.501
This man has
massive internal injuries.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.036
lf l don't operate now,
he'll die.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.073
Treat the burns, or l'll
deactivate your program.

12:55.141 --> 12:57.609
What kind of physician are you?

12:57.676 --> 12:58.938
The first rule of triage

12:59.011 --> 13:00.876
states that critical injuries
take priority.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.107
Your rules, not mine.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.412
From now on, leave the wounded
prey where they fall.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.321
Tend only to our own.

13:16.395 --> 13:22.493
l'm as dry
as the crater at Tarpahk...

13:24.570 --> 13:27.733
...in the middle
of the dry season...

13:27.807 --> 13:30.037
when it's dry!

13:34.647 --> 13:36.012
l'm not done!

13:36.081 --> 13:38.106
Share with your brothers.

13:38.184 --> 13:39.913
lt's the eve of battle.

13:44.456 --> 13:46.924
l may be drunk,

13:46.992 --> 13:50.018
but l can still send your soul
to the next world

13:50.095 --> 13:52.757
and leave your body here
to rot!

13:52.832 --> 13:56.097
Though from the stench of it,
l'd say it's begun to already.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.079
Tom.

14:17.156 --> 14:18.953
Wrong guy.

14:19.024 --> 14:19.956
You speak English?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.890
Yeah.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.360
l speak English.

14:23.429 --> 14:24.521
American?

14:26.732 --> 14:28.063
l didn't see him coming.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.065
You saved my life.

14:29.134 --> 14:30.658
Why are you out of uniform?

14:30.736 --> 14:31.794
What company are you with?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.429
Um...

14:33.539 --> 14:35.473
well, l'm a...l'm a civilian.

14:35.541 --> 14:37.839
ln the middle
of a battle zone in France?

14:37.910 --> 14:38.842
The hell you are.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.338
Go on.

14:41.413 --> 14:43.278
l'm right behind you.

14:43.349 --> 14:46.341
Look, l don't have time
for 20 questions.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.181
You say you're an American?

14:48.254 --> 14:51.746
All right then, if Betty Grable
came around that corner

14:51.824 --> 14:53.314
what part of her
would you be staring at?

14:58.030 --> 15:00.658
Sorry. Time's up.

15:00.733 --> 15:01.597
Her legs!

15:01.667 --> 15:03.692
l- l'd be staring at her legs.

15:08.774 --> 15:10.241
Bull's- eye.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.235
Lucky for you.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.879
You're a gung ho kind of gal,
aren't ya?

15:20.953 --> 15:22.147
Does that bother you?

15:22.221 --> 15:25.213
Nope. Just not used to it,
that's all.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.851
The girls back home
are a little different.

15:27.927 --> 15:31.090
l guess when it comes
to my people's safety,

15:31.163 --> 15:35.623
this girl tends to get
a little...gung ho.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.100
Nothing to apologize for.

15:37.169 --> 15:38.864
l'm the same way with my men.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.203
There's not a day goes by
when l don't think to myself,

15:42.274 --> 15:44.606
"l'm going to get
'em back safely

15:44.677 --> 15:46.372
even if l die trying."

15:46.445 --> 15:48.140
l know the feeling.

15:50.215 --> 15:53.241
We're about to enter some caves
that run under the town.

15:53.319 --> 15:54.251
Caves?

15:54.320 --> 15:55.719
We're going to meet
our contact there.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.812
l should warn you.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.255
There are eccentric people
who live in the caves,

15:59.325 --> 16:00.849
but don't be alarmed.

16:08.801 --> 16:12.669
...ro- cha loH qech

16:12.738 --> 16:16.834
ro- cha loH qech

16:16.909 --> 16:23.906
qor'taH- taH- taH- taH-
taH- taH- taH Dech roH

16:23.983 --> 16:27.646
taH- taH- taH- taH- taH- taH

16:27.720 --> 16:29.984
Dech roH!

16:30.055 --> 16:31.886
Good evening, gentlemen.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.084
Who are you?

16:34.159 --> 16:37.322
How did you get past
our battle lines?

16:37.396 --> 16:38.522
We're friends.

16:38.597 --> 16:39.928
Allies.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.432
Sent by what House?

16:41.533 --> 16:42.625
The House of...

16:44.636 --> 16:47.400
...of ToH- Maag.

16:47.473 --> 16:50.442
ToH- Maag.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.477
l never heard of it.

16:52.578 --> 16:53.567
l'm not surprised.

16:53.645 --> 16:55.112
lt's a long way from here.

16:55.180 --> 16:58.047
This battle doesn't concern you.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.084
Maybe not...

17:01.920 --> 17:03.285
but we'd be honored

17:03.355 --> 17:06.085
to fight alongside
such great warriors.

17:07.925 --> 17:10.359
lf you prefer, we'll take
our weapons elsewhere.

17:10.462 --> 17:12.089
Wait!

17:12.164 --> 17:14.723
l'll consider your request...

17:14.800 --> 17:18.759
but first, prove your fortitude.

17:18.837 --> 17:19.895
Drink!

17:19.972 --> 17:22.406
San- roH

17:22.508 --> 17:24.373
t'patoH- cha!

17:24.443 --> 17:27.537
l guess my French
is a little rusty.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.274
Don't drink it.

17:29.348 --> 17:30.975
lt's twice as strong as whiskey.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.847
l'll be right back.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.589
Eh?

17:55.474 --> 17:58.204
Captain. ls...is it you?

17:58.277 --> 18:01.041
Yes. We've got to disable
the rest of those interfaces.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.171
The controls are routed

18:02.247 --> 18:03.771
through the surgical
console in Sick Bay,

18:03.849 --> 18:05.942
but it will take time
to disable all of them.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.645
We don't have time.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.916
l'll access the Jefferies tube
that runs under that deck plate,

18:10.989 --> 18:13.048
set a few charges
and blow out the console.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.992
Charges? The Hirogen
have seized the armories.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.153
No problem.

18:17.229 --> 18:19.720
l got all the ammo l need
right here.

18:19.798 --> 18:21.231
Holographic explosives?

18:21.300 --> 18:22.733
With the safety protocols
off- line,

18:22.801 --> 18:26.259
they're as good
as the real thing.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.203
Hmm.

18:29.908 --> 18:33.776
Ah! Another of your warriors?

18:33.846 --> 18:35.108
Yes.

18:35.180 --> 18:38.980
He's a frail- looking thing.

18:39.051 --> 18:40.575
l'll contact you
when l've disabled

18:40.652 --> 18:42.176
the rest of the interfaces.

18:42.254 --> 18:43.278
ln the meantime, stay here.

18:43.355 --> 18:44.549
With the Klingons?

18:44.623 --> 18:48.059
Believe me, it's peaceful
compared to Sainte Claire.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.219
Captain.

18:59.304 --> 19:00.794
Please, don't do that.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.013
They've got us outnumbered!

19:15.087 --> 19:16.452
And outgunned.

19:16.522 --> 19:18.012
They're setting up
a machine gun emplacement

19:18.090 --> 19:19.216
across the street.

19:34.139 --> 19:35.663
Where have you been?

19:35.741 --> 19:38.209
Obtaining supplies.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.404
What is this?

19:40.479 --> 19:44.108
German technology taken
from their compound.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.277
l can use them
to enhance our weapons.

19:57.596 --> 19:59.257
l've cornered
several Voyager crewmen,

19:59.331 --> 20:01.322
but they've taken refuge
in a guarded building.

20:01.400 --> 20:04.426
l need three nucleonic charges
to penetrate the structure.

20:04.503 --> 20:07.563
Nucleonic charges could damage
the holodeck further.

20:07.639 --> 20:10.199
Use your hand weapons.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.742
Then l'll need more hunters.

20:11.810 --> 20:14.278
They're on the way.

20:19.685 --> 20:21.482
Damn.
There's a level- 9 force field

20:21.587 --> 20:23.077
around the surgical console.

20:23.155 --> 20:24.918
We'll have to go in
and shut it down.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.048
"Force field"?

20:26.124 --> 20:27.182
l'll explain later.

20:27.259 --> 20:29.090
Set the detonator
for five minutes.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.794
Five hunters have been killed
in the last hour.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.462
You must engage
the safety protocols.

20:39.538 --> 20:41.768
Those protocols
aren't functioning.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.171
Then l'll need assistance to...

20:44.576 --> 20:45.600
Stand by.

20:50.415 --> 20:51.677
You.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.274
Get him out of here.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.980
There are ten pounds of dynamite
under the floor

20:56.054 --> 20:58.249
set to blow in less
than three minutes.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.415
Move.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.642
Bridge to Sick Bay.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.507
Sick Bay, respond.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.915
Bridge to Deck 5.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.183
Converge on the Sick Bay.

22:10.629 --> 22:12.995
- Ow!
- Oh!

22:19.971 --> 22:21.939
We're on the holodeck
under attack.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.998
You must...

22:40.625 --> 22:43.185
Bridge, this is Holodeck 1.

22:43.261 --> 22:44.922
l have seized the building

22:44.996 --> 22:48.295
and l have found
another access to this holodeck.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.664
Seal it.

22:49.735 --> 22:50.827
How many captives?

22:50.902 --> 22:51.834
Four.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.371
Their neural interfaces
have been disabled.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.669
l will make the kill.

22:56.742 --> 22:59.040
No. They are not prey;
they are hostages.

22:59.111 --> 23:00.043
l'll need them.

23:00.145 --> 23:01.806
As you wish.

23:01.847 --> 23:04.247
You. Help me seal this hatch.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.347
So, what do you think?

23:11.423 --> 23:14.017
A boy or a girl?

23:14.092 --> 23:16.151
lt's a holographic projection.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.594
Unfortunately,
it's a very good projection.

23:18.663 --> 23:20.028
l feel 20 kilos heavier.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.690
lt even kicks.

23:21.767 --> 23:23.428
l don't recognize this program.

23:23.502 --> 23:25.265
l do.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.805
He's wearing a Nazi uniform.

23:27.873 --> 23:29.898
We're on Earth
during the second world war.

23:29.975 --> 23:32.102
"Nazi"?

23:32.177 --> 23:34.202
Totalitarian fanatics
bent on world conquest--

23:34.279 --> 23:37.009
the Borg of their day,
no offense.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.174
None taken.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.187
What are you staring at?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.731
Get up.

24:00.038 --> 24:01.300
You deceived me.

24:01.339 --> 24:02.306
Really?

24:02.340 --> 24:04.103
l should've seen through
your flirtations.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.336
lf you say so.

24:05.410 --> 24:09.039
The thought of you
carrying my child disgusts me.

24:09.114 --> 24:10.945
You're not the only one.

24:12.984 --> 24:15.043
Look, l don't know what went on

24:15.120 --> 24:17.452
between the two of you,
but it's obviously over now.

24:18.890 --> 24:21.688
l see you're acquainted.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.058
Do you find her as attractive
as l once did?

24:26.998 --> 24:28.522
l'll miss our nights together.

24:29.434 --> 24:30.366
Pig!

24:32.704 --> 24:34.296
Put the weapon away.

24:35.907 --> 24:38.034
Now.

24:48.887 --> 24:51.014
Funny. He doesn't
seem like your type.

24:55.894 --> 24:56.952
Doctor, trouble.

24:57.028 --> 24:58.086
Now what?

24:58.163 --> 24:59.858
The Klingons are starting
to wake up from their nap.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.296
All right, all right, hold on.

25:01.399 --> 25:03.026
What are you doing?

25:03.068 --> 25:04.933
l've established an interface
with Holodeck 1.

25:05.003 --> 25:06.493
l want to monitor
what's going on over there

25:06.571 --> 25:08.004
in case the crew needs my help.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.301
Qapla'!

25:09.374 --> 25:12.343
Uh- oh. What should we do?

25:12.410 --> 25:13.934
Not having a cure
for Klingon hangovers,

25:14.012 --> 25:15.104
l couldn't tell you.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.509
The battle has begun.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.145
Our plan is to penetrate
the enemy's position,

25:23.221 --> 25:25.086
cut his forces in half.

25:25.156 --> 25:26.953
And a very good plan it is.

25:27.025 --> 25:28.583
Best of luck with it.

25:28.660 --> 25:30.594
You

25:30.662 --> 25:33.790
will lead us into
battle, great warrior.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.231
Maybe l'll just watch
from here--

25:36.301 --> 25:37.768
try to offer up some pointers

25:37.836 --> 25:38.825
as things develop.

25:38.904 --> 25:43.841
to'qaH! Lead the attack
or die here by my hand.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.376
You heard him.

25:45.443 --> 25:47.206
Don't argue with the man--
run along.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.746
l'll reattach any severed limbs.

25:48.813 --> 25:50.075
Just don't misplace them.

25:50.949 --> 25:53.144
You! Cover our flank.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.480
Qapla'!

25:57.556 --> 25:58.921
Qapla'.

25:59.925 --> 26:00.983
Tallyho.

26:05.797 --> 26:06.786
Enter.

26:11.903 --> 26:13.268
Leave her.

26:13.338 --> 26:15.863
l see you've done
some redecorating.

26:15.941 --> 26:19.638
Your attempt
to retake this vessel was...

26:19.711 --> 26:21.144
inventive.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.578
From the day l seized
Voyager, you put up

26:23.648 --> 26:27.311
a dauntless fight,
but your fight is over now.

26:27.385 --> 26:30.115
You're going to help me
shut down these simulations

26:30.188 --> 26:31.815
and repair the holodecks.

26:31.890 --> 26:33.721
No.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.625
We'll destroy this ship
before we surrender it.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.720
Don't threaten me, Captain.

26:38.797 --> 26:41.561
l've faced far more
intimidating prey than you.

26:41.633 --> 26:44.932
lf this fight continues,
l promise you,

26:45.003 --> 26:49.440
l will hunt down and kill
every member of your crew.

26:49.574 --> 26:52.134
Well, by then this ship
will be damaged beyond repair

26:52.210 --> 26:54.838
and there won't be much
of a trophy left, will there?

26:54.913 --> 26:56.574
Perhaps l should kill you

26:56.648 --> 26:59.048
and find someone
who will cooperate.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.312
Good luck.
You'll get the same response

27:01.419 --> 27:02.351
from all of them.

27:02.387 --> 27:03.513
You don't realize
what's at stake.

27:03.588 --> 27:05.818
l know what's at stake--
your sick little game.

27:05.890 --> 27:08.154
This is not a game!

27:08.226 --> 27:09.352
Then what is it?

27:13.131 --> 27:16.123
l'm trying to create a future
for my people.

27:16.201 --> 27:17.600
Future?

27:17.669 --> 27:20.263
l don't expect you
to understand.

27:20.338 --> 27:21.600
You are prey.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.368
You underestimate us.

27:27.445 --> 27:28.742
Yes.

27:30.682 --> 27:32.650
Perhaps l do.

27:33.685 --> 27:34.879
l'm listening.

27:39.357 --> 27:42.986
My people are hunting
themselves into extinction.

27:44.796 --> 27:47.663
Your holodeck technology
might offer us

27:47.732 --> 27:50.200
an alternative--
a new way of life.

27:50.268 --> 27:53.032
lnstead of scattering ourselves
across the Quadrant

27:53.104 --> 27:57.336
in pursuit of prey,
we could simulate the hunt

27:57.409 --> 28:01.869
and give ourselves a chance
to rebuild our civilization.

28:01.946 --> 28:05.848
And confine your killing
to holograms.

28:05.917 --> 28:09.353
With the safety protocols
off- line, the pursuit is just

28:09.454 --> 28:10.978
as challenging.

28:11.056 --> 28:12.683
Oh, l understand
what you're trying to do,

28:12.757 --> 28:17.160
but then...why have
you been torturing us?

28:17.228 --> 28:18.820
Why have you thrown my crew

28:18.897 --> 28:21.331
into one brutal
simulation after another?

28:21.399 --> 28:25.358
l've been studying your behavior
as l do with all my prey,

28:25.437 --> 28:28.531
but your holodecks
allowed me to go further--

28:28.606 --> 28:32.599
to explore your culture,
your history.

28:34.079 --> 28:37.412
l must admit
l've learned a great deal.

28:37.482 --> 28:38.574
How so?

28:38.650 --> 28:41.744
Your people have faced
extinction many times,

28:41.820 --> 28:44.414
but you've always
managed to avoid it.

28:44.489 --> 28:48.619
You seem to recognize
the need for change.

28:48.693 --> 28:51.025
Yes. You've got one
of those moments

28:51.096 --> 28:52.620
running right now
on the holodeck.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.562
We called it World War ll.

28:54.632 --> 28:56.623
One of your most difficult eras.

28:56.701 --> 28:59.033
And yet you survived.

28:59.104 --> 29:00.230
lt wasn't easy.

29:00.338 --> 29:03.364
You are a resilient species.

29:05.543 --> 29:07.909
l admire your cunning.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.574
Let's end this.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.545
l'll call a cease- fire

29:13.618 --> 29:16.348
and we can try
to contain the damage.

29:16.421 --> 29:19.618
l want my ship back,
but in return, l will give you

29:19.691 --> 29:22.717
what you need to create
the holodeck technology.

29:24.329 --> 29:27.457
lt would be cunning
for you to agree.

29:44.482 --> 29:46.950
Synthetic.

29:47.018 --> 29:48.986
And undrinkable.

29:49.053 --> 29:51.248
l am tired of this simulation.

29:51.322 --> 29:53.085
Mein Herr, a word with you.

29:53.158 --> 29:55.991
And these holograms
are becoming annoying as well.

29:56.060 --> 29:58.255
What are we waiting for?

29:58.329 --> 30:01.196
Why don't we execute
these prisoners?

30:01.266 --> 30:04.667
Orders from the commandant.

30:06.604 --> 30:07.901
lf l may speak freely?

30:10.708 --> 30:14.075
The commandant has been acting
strangely the past few days.

30:14.145 --> 30:18.241
He's been questioning
German superiority.

30:18.316 --> 30:22.685
Perhaps we shouldn't follow
his orders so...

30:22.754 --> 30:24.346
blindly.

30:24.422 --> 30:27.152
You will do as he says...

30:27.225 --> 30:29.921
as long as l tell you to.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.484
l don't know how much longer

30:31.596 --> 30:33.496
l can stand
being trapped in here.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.193
Perhaps you would enjoy
some entertainment.

30:43.107 --> 30:44.074
Sing.

30:45.310 --> 30:46.538
l will not.

30:46.611 --> 30:48.306
Sing...

30:49.781 --> 30:51.646
or you will die.

30:55.386 --> 30:57.547
Then l'll die.

30:57.622 --> 31:01.649
Seven, you are a valued member
of this crew.

31:01.726 --> 31:04.286
The logical response
would be to grant his request.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.954
Logic is irrelevant.

31:07.298 --> 31:10.597
One day the Borg
will assimilate your species

31:10.668 --> 31:13.296
despite your arrogance.

31:13.371 --> 31:17.068
When that moment arrives,
remember me.

31:17.141 --> 31:19.905
Bridge to Holodeck 1.

31:19.978 --> 31:21.070
Yes.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.239
l've come to an agreement
with Captain Janeway.

31:24.315 --> 31:26.249
Call a cease- fire.

31:26.317 --> 31:27.784
What?

31:27.852 --> 31:28.784
Captain...?

31:28.853 --> 31:29.785
lt's true, Tuvok.

31:29.854 --> 31:31.116
Our first order of business

31:31.189 --> 31:32.451
is to call off the troops.

31:32.523 --> 31:33.820
l want you to find Chakotay

31:33.892 --> 31:35.689
and have him
convince his soldiers

31:35.760 --> 31:37.091
to pull out of the city.

31:37.161 --> 31:38.788
Aye, Captain.

31:38.863 --> 31:43.129
Turanj, order our hunters
to end the fighting.

31:43.201 --> 31:44.133
This is madness.

31:44.202 --> 31:46.136
We're winning this battle.

31:46.204 --> 31:49.765
Our civilization depends
on this agreement.

31:49.841 --> 31:51.832
Acknowledged.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.502
You heard him.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.044
Release the captives.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.671
l'll tell the others.

31:59.317 --> 32:04.414
Order all units
to withdraw to these positions.

32:04.522 --> 32:06.456
l have always thought
highly of you.

32:06.491 --> 32:07.685
Have you?

32:07.759 --> 32:08.726
Yes.

32:10.295 --> 32:13.093
But the commandant is a fool.

32:13.164 --> 32:15.598
He doesn't understand.

32:15.667 --> 32:19.797
He's never embraced
the Fuhrer...or his vision.

32:19.871 --> 32:23.967
One does not cooperate
with decadent forms of life.

32:24.042 --> 32:27.102
One hunts them down
and eliminates them.

32:27.178 --> 32:30.113
The commandant speaks
of civilization.

32:30.181 --> 32:32.308
The ancient Romans
were civilized.

32:32.383 --> 32:34.146
The Jews are civilized.

32:34.218 --> 32:38.018
But in all its moral
decay, Rome fell

32:38.089 --> 32:40.614
to the spears
of our ancestors...

32:40.692 --> 32:43.388
as the Jews are falling now.

32:45.630 --> 32:48.929
Look at our destiny.

32:49.000 --> 32:50.831
The field of red.

32:52.870 --> 32:54.963
The purity of German blood.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.599
The blazing white
circle of the sun

32:57.675 --> 32:59.973
that sanctified that blood.

33:00.044 --> 33:04.003
No one can deny us,
no power on Earth or beyond--

33:04.082 --> 33:07.245
not the Christian savior,
not the God of the Jews.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.412
We are driven by the very force

33:10.488 --> 33:13.048
that gives life
to the universe itself.

33:13.124 --> 33:15.592
We must countermand
the commandant's orders.

33:15.660 --> 33:17.560
Stay and fight.

33:17.628 --> 33:19.789
We must be faithful
to who we are.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.872
You two, follow me.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.016
All units, clear the valley.

33:48.092 --> 33:49.957
Return
to your previous positions.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.586
We're calling a cease- fire.

33:51.662 --> 33:53.857
Repeat. Cease- fire.

33:53.931 --> 33:55.990
Well, the word is out.

33:56.067 --> 33:58.092
Whether it will be acted upon
is another question.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.727
Oh, they'll follow orders.

33:59.804 --> 34:01.533
l'm their commanding officer,
remember?

34:09.047 --> 34:11.139
Keep it moving!
Keep it moving!

34:11.215 --> 34:12.545
Get the lead out of your pants!

34:12.617 --> 34:14.244
Yes, sir. You heard him!
Let's move it.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.083
Mid- 20th century American slang.

34:17.155 --> 34:19.054
You got a problem
with that, sister?

34:19.123 --> 34:22.251
You're enjoying this simulation.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.418
l find that peculiar,
given the circumstances.

34:24.495 --> 34:25.553
Loosen up, baby doll.

34:25.630 --> 34:26.755
The war's almost over.

34:31.636 --> 34:34.230
So much for the cease- fire!

34:34.304 --> 34:36.431
Fire! Fire!

34:36.507 --> 34:38.475
l've been monitoring
the other simulation

34:38.543 --> 34:39.804
and the fighting's
getting worse.

34:39.877 --> 34:41.639
The crew is taking
heavy casualties.

34:41.712 --> 34:43.235
How can we help?

34:43.313 --> 34:45.612
l'll transfer my program
to Holodeck 1.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.310
You take the Jefferies tube
and meet me there.

34:47.385 --> 34:49.376
There's only the two of us.

34:49.454 --> 34:50.819
Nevertheless,
we have to try and...

34:54.525 --> 34:55.889
Even half drunk,

34:55.960 --> 34:59.953
Klingons are among the best
warriors in the galaxy.

35:00.031 --> 35:02.158
But they're already
in the middle of a war

35:02.200 --> 35:05.397
with the House of...
mmm, uh, whatever it is.

35:05.470 --> 35:06.767
Then you'll just have
to convince them

35:06.838 --> 35:08.499
that there's a more important
battle to be waged.

35:08.573 --> 35:10.131
What, me?

35:10.208 --> 35:12.403
You are their"great warrior."
Lead them.

35:18.783 --> 35:19.943
Pardon me, gentlemen.

35:20.017 --> 35:22.349
l wonder if l might
have a word with you.

35:24.188 --> 35:26.315
They're Klingons, not kittens.

35:31.496 --> 35:33.020
You will listen!

35:35.833 --> 35:38.734
These sensors show you've placed

35:38.803 --> 35:40.828
holo- emitters
on Decks 5 through 12?

35:40.905 --> 35:42.668
No wonder the system breached.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.435
You've turned Voyager
into one big holodeck.

35:44.575 --> 35:46.167
Can you shut it down?

35:46.244 --> 35:48.405
Yes, but l'm going to have
to initiate an overload.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.810
We'll worry about
making repairs later.

35:49.881 --> 35:51.872
Right now, we've got to put
an end to those simulations.

35:51.949 --> 35:53.678
Janeway to Ensign Kim.

35:53.751 --> 35:54.683
Yes, Captain.

35:54.752 --> 35:56.014
Harry, l'm going
to need your help

35:56.087 --> 35:57.748
overloading
the holo- emitter network.

35:57.822 --> 36:00.916
l'm transferring optical
processor control to you now.

36:00.992 --> 36:03.153
Start charging the
secondary power relays.

36:03.227 --> 36:04.922
We'll use them
to trigger the overload.

36:04.996 --> 36:06.190
l'm on it.

36:06.264 --> 36:07.322
This is going to take some time.

36:07.398 --> 36:09.559
There are over 800 emitters
that we have to...

36:09.634 --> 36:11.363
Move away from the controls!

36:11.469 --> 36:13.630
Why haven't you ordered
the cease- fire?

36:20.611 --> 36:22.545
Move away from the controls.

36:22.613 --> 36:24.410
Listen to me.

36:24.482 --> 36:25.642
No!

36:40.097 --> 36:41.689
What are you waiting for?

36:41.766 --> 36:43.427
l am a hunter.

36:43.534 --> 36:45.399
You are my prey.

36:49.473 --> 36:50.872
Run.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.011
Acknowledged. Out.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.948
Our holographic allies
are losing ground.

37:33.017 --> 37:34.644
The German troops
are surrounding the city.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.687
l don't know how much longer
we can hold them off.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.688
These weapons are pretty crude.

37:38.756 --> 37:40.155
They're not much help.

37:40.224 --> 37:41.521
Maybe we should fall back.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.856
Where to? They're coming in
from all sides.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.122
Tuvok, any chance we can get

37:45.196 --> 37:46.720
through that breach
in the hologrid?

37:46.797 --> 37:48.560
Unlikely.
20 more Hirogen

37:48.633 --> 37:50.260
have taken up position
near the opening.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.562
We are outnumbered.

37:53.671 --> 37:55.002
How's it going?

37:55.072 --> 37:56.437
l'm modifying
this explosive device

37:56.540 --> 37:58.098
to emit a photonic burst.

37:58.175 --> 37:59.972
lt'll be harmless
to organic tissue,

38:00.011 --> 38:01.774
but it should disrupt
all holographic activity

38:01.812 --> 38:02.870
within 20 meters.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.812
We'll try to buy you some time.

38:48.459 --> 38:49.790
l'll be in Sick Bay.

39:10.881 --> 39:12.280
Schnell!
Schnell!

39:12.350 --> 39:13.977
Ja.

39:19.657 --> 39:21.090
They're closing in.
Seven!

39:39.210 --> 39:41.007
Surrender.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.111
Auf stehen.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.149
Verdammt.

40:25.222 --> 40:27.019
Bring that one to me.

40:30.294 --> 40:32.626
l will spare
your life for now,

40:32.696 --> 40:36.223
but only because you are
carrying a German child.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.724
Please don't do this.

41:15.039 --> 41:16.973
l can be of use to you.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.566
l can help you repair the ship.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.167
Don't kill me.

41:31.188 --> 41:32.678
Against the wall.

41:37.228 --> 41:40.356
Your deaths will serve
the glory of the Reich.

41:40.431 --> 41:42.729
Prepare to fire.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.831
Fight on, warriors!

42:18.903 --> 42:19.835
This way!

42:19.904 --> 42:21.337
Qapla', gentlemen!
Qapla'!

42:38.322 --> 42:40.688
This hunt is over.

42:40.758 --> 42:43.249
Tell your hunters to stand down.

42:43.327 --> 42:47.855
l'll use this
if you force me to.

43:15.793 --> 43:17.317
lt's over.

43:17.394 --> 43:19.191
Let's go.

43:24.234 --> 43:28.967
Captain's Log, Stardate 517 15. 2.

43:29.039 --> 43:31.974
The damage to Voyager
has been extreme.

43:32.042 --> 43:34.670
Both sides have taken
heavy casualties,

43:34.745 --> 43:38.181
and it's clear that no one
is going to win this conflict.

43:38.248 --> 43:40.409
The fighting
has reached a standstill

43:40.484 --> 43:42.384
and the remaining Hirogen

43:42.453 --> 43:45.013
have agreed
to negotiate a truce.

43:45.089 --> 43:46.920
What is this?

43:46.991 --> 43:48.925
An optronic datacore.

43:48.993 --> 43:52.156
You can use it to create
holodeck technology

43:52.229 --> 43:54.129
on your own vessels.

43:54.198 --> 43:57.861
l made a promise with your
leader before he died

43:57.935 --> 43:59.835
that l would give this
knowledge to the Hirogen.

43:59.903 --> 44:00.927
Take it.

44:01.038 --> 44:04.166
His ideas were unconventional.

44:04.208 --> 44:06.142
l do not share them.

44:06.210 --> 44:09.338
Was he any more unconventional
than you are...

44:09.413 --> 44:12.348
calling a cease- fire
with your prey?

44:12.416 --> 44:14.179
Only a few days ago,

44:14.251 --> 44:16.151
the thought of speaking
with us on equal terms

44:16.220 --> 44:19.189
would've been inconceivable,
but here we are.

44:19.256 --> 44:21.656
Accept this...

44:24.495 --> 44:26.622
trophy.

44:26.697 --> 44:30.258
You can use it to create
a new future for your people.

44:30.334 --> 44:33.167
At the very least, you can
hang it on your bulkhead.
