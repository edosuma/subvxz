00:01.585 --> 00:03.576
(walkers growling in distance)

00:19.686 --> 00:21.677
(growling continues)

00:34.493 --> 00:36.484
(growling continues)

01:26.795 --> 01:28.786
(walkers growling)

02:04.625 --> 02:06.616
(growling continues)

02:17.262 --> 02:19.253
(walkers growling in distance)

02:35.072 --> 02:37.279
(insects chirping)

02:37.366 --> 02:39.357
(growling continues)

03:10.190 --> 03:11.601
(sighs)

03:15.070 --> 03:17.027
(Crying softly)

03:23.078 --> 03:25.035
(sighs)

03:28.875 --> 03:30.741
(growling continues)

03:43.390 --> 03:45.097
H9)!-

03:45.183 --> 03:46.890
We got to go.

03:59.197 --> 04:01.188
(growling continues)

04:04.911 --> 04:06.652
H9)!-

04:11.293 --> 04:13.705
He used to sit on the roof.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.456
We have to go.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.289
(walkers growling)

04:46.244 --> 04:47.860
Michonne!

04:47.954 --> 04:49.695
(walkers growling)

04:58.924 --> 05:00.210
Michonne.

05:02.677 --> 05:04.509
Michonne!

05:04.596 --> 05:05.836
(growling continues)

05:29.996 --> 05:31.327
(engine starts)

05:31.414 --> 05:32.700
(tires screech)

05:58.233 --> 05:59.974
(sighs)

06:13.582 --> 06:15.414
What do you think he meant?

06:19.629 --> 06:22.963
Did he want us
to stop fighting the Saviors?

06:23.049 --> 06:27.293
Just... surrender to Negan?

06:32.934 --> 06:35.221
We could pull over.

06:35.312 --> 06:37.929
- We could read what he wrote.
- No. Not yet.

06:38.023 --> 06:39.809
Not me.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.642
(sniffles)

06:45.780 --> 06:47.987
Rick.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.439
(breathes sharply)

06:49.534 --> 06:51.275
He-- Carl...

06:51.369 --> 06:53.076
He...

06:54.164 --> 06:56.952
wrote a letter to Negan.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.873
I need to talk to Jadis.

07:04.674 --> 07:06.790
What?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.593
They have weapons... people.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.795
We can't just give that up.

07:11.890 --> 07:14.097
Why now?

07:14.184 --> 07:16.972
They went with me to the Sanctuary.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.854
The Saviors saw us there.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.103
They're gonna be a target, too.

07:28.907 --> 07:30.818
We still need them.

07:31.785 --> 07:34.197
They're ours, not theirs.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.281
(walkers growling)

08:35.181 --> 08:36.967
Damn it.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.724
Hilltop is covered.
The roads and then some.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.932
They are out there somewhere,
so let's get balls deep

09:28.026 --> 09:31.109
in every nook and cranny
they might hole up in.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.530
Nooks, crannies, and holes, people.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.278
All that shit outside the box.

09:37.368 --> 09:38.824
(static crackles, clicks)

09:41.498 --> 09:43.159
Appears our friends at Alexandria

09:43.249 --> 09:45.411
had themselves an escape plan.

09:45.502 --> 09:49.587
Rick's little one-eyed
pride and joy played me.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.797
Damn.

09:52.884 --> 09:54.670
That kid...

09:54.761 --> 09:57.048
that kid is built for this shit.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.971
Let me go out and close this thing.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.891
Arat's got it for now.

10:02.977 --> 10:05.014
How'd the Hilltop go?

10:05.855 --> 10:07.687
As requested.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.855
Good job.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.558
With an extra attaboy on top

10:10.652 --> 10:13.485
given I know you didn't want
to play it that way.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.773
You hear anything from Gavin?

10:17.867 --> 10:20.450
Not yet, but it's coming.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.783
Gavin may be perpetually pissed off,

10:23.873 --> 10:26.285
but he keeps his shit dry and tight.

10:31.881 --> 10:34.623
If I'm not running down
Rick and company,

10:34.717 --> 10:36.173
where do you want me?

10:41.099 --> 10:42.715
(sighs)

10:48.398 --> 10:50.230
(chair scrapes)

10:55.321 --> 10:57.437
Garbage people.

10:57.532 --> 10:58.693
Good.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.445
Eliminating those who reneged might...

11:01.536 --> 11:03.618
leave us a tad short on ammo,

11:03.705 --> 11:05.867
but it's worth it.

11:10.712 --> 11:13.454
I need you to hear me on this, Simon.

11:14.757 --> 11:16.464
Those piss-stained double-crossers

11:16.551 --> 11:18.258
may have pulled a triple cross,

11:18.344 --> 11:19.834
but it doesn't change the fact

11:19.929 --> 11:22.045
that they are still a resource.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.926
So you're gonna choke back

11:24.017 --> 11:26.475
whatever shit is stirring up inside you

11:26.561 --> 11:29.269
and remind them
that a deal with the Saviors

11:29.355 --> 11:33.349
is a lock, stock, suck my barrel deal.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.232
Deliver the standard message,

11:38.323 --> 11:40.439
take one out,

11:40.533 --> 11:43.366
and the rest will fall in line.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.953
Just one, Simon.

11:55.590 --> 11:58.503
If you've got something to say...

11:59.385 --> 12:01.001
say it.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.590
Maybe we should cut our losses here.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.101
These people can't learn the lesson,

12:10.188 --> 12:13.476
no matter how many times we teach it.

12:13.566 --> 12:17.981
Alexandria, Hilltop, Kingdom,
these garbage rats--

12:18.071 --> 12:20.108
they're not seeming
to understand the situation.

12:20.198 --> 12:22.781
Not one little bit.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.162
So maybe we learn our lesson,

12:29.249 --> 12:31.616
scrape the plates into the trash.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.535
Move further out.

12:35.838 --> 12:39.126
Find other communities to...

12:39.217 --> 12:40.878
"save."

12:40.969 --> 12:42.960
(chuckles)

12:45.056 --> 12:47.718
Oh, I am doing my best

12:47.809 --> 12:50.392
to hold it together right now.

12:51.813 --> 12:55.772
You wanna cut your losses,
take your own advice.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.562
Killing everybody to solve the problem--

12:58.653 --> 13:01.566
that is the easy way, not our way.

13:01.656 --> 13:03.988
What we do...

13:04.075 --> 13:07.193
saving people, it is hard.

13:09.247 --> 13:12.490
But it damn well works.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.669
Not lately.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.882
Once I clip Rick,

13:22.969 --> 13:26.837
everything's aces again, Simon.

13:30.351 --> 13:32.012
(knock on door)

13:34.439 --> 13:35.975
Yeah?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.648
(door creaks open)

13:38.735 --> 13:40.897
(walker growling)

13:46.075 --> 13:47.361
What the hell is that?

13:47.452 --> 13:49.784
A delivery from the Hilltop.

13:49.871 --> 13:51.782
I brought you something to deal with it.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.455
It's charged.

13:55.710 --> 13:57.701
Out.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.911
(growling continues, thumping)

14:09.807 --> 14:11.764
(growling, thumping)

14:27.700 --> 14:28.906
Negan: Little bit more.

14:28.993 --> 14:31.234
(growling)

14:31.329 --> 14:33.445
(nail gun firing)

14:33.539 --> 14:36.497
(growling stops)

14:36.584 --> 14:38.040
Simon: That's Dean.

14:38.127 --> 14:40.459
That means the other "38"
that the Hilltop are holding

14:40.546 --> 14:42.378
are from the Satellite Outpost.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.830
Those are my people.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.257
I'm gonna kill
every last one of those farmers!

14:46.344 --> 14:47.960
You will do exactly what I asked.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.965
We can't let 'em get away with this shit.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.969
- (pounds table)
- You will do...

14:53.059 --> 14:54.766
Your job!

15:11.077 --> 15:13.364
Aaron:
We came here to ask for your help.

15:13.454 --> 15:15.411
Woman: Well, you shouldn't have.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.339
Hey. Please. Just...

15:30.430 --> 15:32.546
- Please. Just...
- (handcuffs clicking)

15:32.640 --> 15:34.176
Let's talk about this.

15:40.189 --> 15:42.396
Natania was your family.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.350
It's up to you, Cyndie.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.901
All of it.

15:46.988 --> 15:48.820
We should just kill them.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.076
(lock clicks)

16:06.048 --> 16:07.959
We're gonna get out of this.

16:11.012 --> 16:14.221
(voice breaking)
This is-- It's not about that.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.228
She made it so I had to do it.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.225
She made me kill her.

16:31.449 --> 16:33.235
I'd do it again.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.862
I'd have to.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.947
Even knowing it would feel this way.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.373
(door creaks open)

16:49.175 --> 16:52.258
(handcuffs clicking)

16:57.225 --> 16:59.057
Thank you.

16:59.143 --> 17:01.134
(handcuffs clicking)

17:10.905 --> 17:12.566
Take them to the beach.

17:12.656 --> 17:15.365
- You're going to kill us?
- Take them.

17:15.451 --> 17:17.192
This is your decision.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.401
You own it.

17:18.496 --> 17:20.281
Enid: Cyndie.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.829
You better have a good reason
for killing us

17:21.915 --> 17:24.829
other than thinking
it'll make you feel better.

17:24.919 --> 17:26.284
Because it won't.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.119
Let's just get it over with.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.000
Enid:
Why would you kill us?

17:30.091 --> 17:31.832
To punish us?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.963
I mean, don't you get it?

17:34.053 --> 17:36.260
Killing is the punishment.

17:36.347 --> 17:40.215
You execute us, then maybe
some of ours will come looking for us.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.050
And maybe you'll take them out,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.852
but eventually,
enough of them will come back

17:44.939 --> 17:47.101
and they will wipe you out.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.730
Your grandmother got herself killed,

17:51.821 --> 17:54.688
so don't make the same mistake.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.364
Just let us go...

17:56.450 --> 17:59.784
and we'll keep fighting them
and you can keep hiding.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.998
No.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.463
They live.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.258
(indistinct conversations)

18:15.344 --> 18:19.053
If we win, do you even want to know?

18:19.140 --> 18:20.630
Yes.

18:20.725 --> 18:22.716
Then help us win.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.427
We're helping you win
by not killing you both.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.058
That's our contribution to the cause.

18:28.149 --> 18:30.436
You've taken everything else
we could give.

18:31.736 --> 18:33.727
(birds chirping, squawking)

18:40.161 --> 18:42.402
Don't come here again.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.832
Stop trying to kill strangers.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.333
We know who we have to kill.

18:52.423 --> 18:55.666
We know the difference
between friends and enemies.

18:56.594 --> 18:58.335
You should, too.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.884
Don't come back.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.316
You know how to get to the car?

19:19.408 --> 19:20.569
Yeah.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.741
Good.

19:22.912 --> 19:23.993
No.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.412
Aaron, they're not gonna help us.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.115
I want to go home.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.167
I do, more than anything.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.087
But I can't leave.

19:35.883 --> 19:38.466
- Not until they join the fight.
- They're not joining.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.553
Beatrice and Kathy
were open to fighting before.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.927
I think I can convince them.
I just need time.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.258
Okay, then we both stay.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.014
You need to get back.

19:49.105 --> 19:51.346
Tell Maggie what's happening,
what I'm doing...

19:52.817 --> 19:54.854
and you need to tell her not to come.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.904
They'll kill you if you go back there.

19:59.990 --> 20:01.651
I won't go back there.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.362
It'll be okay.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.618
No matter what happens, I'll be okay.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.415
Promise me I'll see you again.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.629
Promise.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.049
Promise me you'll be okay.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.109
Go.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.299
(indistinct conversations in distance)

21:09.226 --> 21:11.217
(indistinct conversations)

21:16.317 --> 21:18.684
So...

21:18.778 --> 21:20.610
we lighting up the Hilltop?

21:21.697 --> 21:24.155
Gonna sit on our dicks a mite more.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.699
Alas, we're going to the landfill.

21:28.245 --> 21:30.657
No worries, Gary.

21:30.748 --> 21:33.331
Not a single one in the world.

21:33.417 --> 21:34.407
(whistles)

21:34.502 --> 21:36.413
(indistinct conversations)

21:36.504 --> 21:37.915
(door creaking)

21:44.345 --> 21:46.336
(weapons cocking)

21:47.890 --> 21:50.382
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nellie!

21:50.476 --> 21:53.810
Everybody keep their horses
inside the gate!

21:53.896 --> 21:56.308
After all, we're friends.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.724
Right?

22:02.863 --> 22:05.195
Now that that's out of the way,

22:05.282 --> 22:07.774
let's get down to the brass tacks.

22:07.868 --> 22:11.532
Bottom line,
I'm gonna need an apology.

22:11.622 --> 22:13.238
The genuine article.

22:19.630 --> 22:23.089
Now, I know you had
your little side deal with Rick.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.173
You came to our home,
pretty much arm in arm.

22:29.890 --> 22:33.303
This despite the pre-existing
arrangement with us.

22:35.312 --> 22:39.306
Now you know we saw you,
because we tried to kill you.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.229
So... (sighs)

22:42.319 --> 22:45.152
you've had plenty of time
to prepare something.

22:46.907 --> 22:51.322
(clicks tongue)
A heartfelt act of confession, I hope.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.074
(sucks teeth)

22:55.165 --> 22:58.578
Feel free to refer to any notes
you may have prepared.

23:00.588 --> 23:02.795
No deal with Rick.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.668
Delivered him.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.248
Brought to you.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.004
But you shot.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.965
Bull... shit!

23:18.480 --> 23:20.437
(inhales deeply)

23:23.777 --> 23:25.313
But no need to worry.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.769
(chuckles)

23:29.575 --> 23:33.318
'Cause you caught yourself a break--

23:33.412 --> 23:35.653
a big ol' break, if you ask me.

23:37.124 --> 23:42.210
Negan is graciously willing
to forgo any punishment,

23:42.296 --> 23:44.207
provided you agree to revert

23:44.298 --> 23:46.505
to the agreed-upon terms of our deal.

23:46.592 --> 23:49.050
You do that...

23:49.136 --> 23:51.127
all is forgiven.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.797
That's some crazy good luck, right?

23:56.060 --> 23:57.550
(sucks teeth)

23:57.645 --> 24:02.435
However, we will be taking
all your guns and ammunition.

24:02.524 --> 24:04.561
Not our deal.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.858
No, it isn't.

24:07.988 --> 24:10.855
But we currently have a need.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.943
And as friends, you will grant us

24:15.037 --> 24:18.575
this neighborly gesture
as a sign of good faith.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.373
Dangers everywhere.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.621
Need guns, too.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.497
Not when you got us.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.252
And if and when the time comes
for you to have guns,

24:28.342 --> 24:31.460
the Saviors will provide them for you.

24:31.553 --> 24:35.512
Spit-shined, ready to go.

24:35.599 --> 24:38.136
(scavengers murmuring)

24:44.984 --> 24:46.145
Thank you.

24:48.570 --> 24:50.356
(inhales deeply)

25:14.221 --> 25:16.553
(whistles) Mm!

25:16.640 --> 25:18.051
Is this you?

25:19.768 --> 25:22.135
It's not bad.

25:22.229 --> 25:24.596
You learn before or after?

25:24.690 --> 25:26.397
Don't learn.

25:26.483 --> 25:28.019
This?

25:28.110 --> 25:29.896
Come to know.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.195
Oh.

25:35.117 --> 25:38.485
Why the dump? (scoffs)

25:38.579 --> 25:41.162
I mean, there had to be
a better place to call home.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.324
Our place.

25:45.294 --> 25:46.534
Ours.

25:50.174 --> 25:53.383
What's the deal with the helipad in back?

25:55.554 --> 25:57.465
The solar panels?

25:59.141 --> 26:00.723
What was this place?

26:03.812 --> 26:05.394
A dump.

26:07.566 --> 26:08.772
(chuckles)

26:10.944 --> 26:12.526
(chuckles)

26:18.077 --> 26:20.318
I want to know if you know.

26:23.123 --> 26:24.784
You have guns.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.832
We have deal?

26:26.919 --> 26:29.081
It occurs to me that I've not yet received

26:29.171 --> 26:31.754
the full definition of an apology.

26:32.549 --> 26:36.087
I feel like I've gotten some
transgressional acknowledgment,

26:36.178 --> 26:39.921
the guns certainly cover restitution.

26:40.015 --> 26:42.882
But what I'm not yet feeling...

26:42.976 --> 26:44.558
is the remorse.

26:46.647 --> 26:49.184
There is remorse.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.185
(scavengers murmuring)

26:57.825 --> 26:59.907
There is remorse.

26:59.993 --> 27:00.983
No!

27:01.078 --> 27:03.365
(scavengers screaming)

27:03.455 --> 27:05.241
Say it again!

27:09.586 --> 27:13.671
There is remorse, you son of a bitch!

27:13.757 --> 27:15.498
(chuckles)

27:15.592 --> 27:18.050
Ohhh.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.925
No, no, no.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.005
Uaughs)

27:23.100 --> 27:24.682
Ohm

27:24.768 --> 27:25.803
Ah.

27:27.771 --> 27:29.557
I don't think you mean that.

27:38.949 --> 27:40.360
Light it up, gents.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.236
(all murmuring)

27:42.327 --> 27:43.943
Light it up now!

27:44.037 --> 27:46.028
(scavengers screaming, gunfire)

27:47.457 --> 27:49.448
(indistinct shouting)

28:04.057 --> 28:06.298
(engine rumbling)

28:09.813 --> 28:12.054
(engine shuts off)

28:13.317 --> 28:16.605
(engines rumbling)

28:18.155 --> 28:19.520
Got it done?

28:19.615 --> 28:21.572
That and then some.

28:21.658 --> 28:22.989
(door creaks open)

28:23.076 --> 28:24.157
You good?

28:24.244 --> 28:26.952
Negan: Nothing on Gavin.

28:27.039 --> 28:29.406
Simon: Want me to turn back around,

28:29.499 --> 28:33.117
roll out, end the mystery?

28:33.212 --> 28:34.373
(sighs)

28:34.463 --> 28:37.205
I already sent a team out there.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.210
Ah.

28:39.301 --> 28:41.212
Well, I'm sure he's A-okay.

28:41.303 --> 28:45.012
And if not,
we'll just send another message.

28:46.433 --> 28:48.674
So, tell me how it went.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.515
Standard message and delivery.

28:51.605 --> 28:53.391
Showed 'em and told 'em. (sniffs)

28:54.816 --> 28:56.932
- There was remorse.
- D.J.: Negan.

28:57.027 --> 28:59.439
Yeah. What is it?

28:59.529 --> 29:01.395
It's Rick.

29:16.922 --> 29:19.630
(walkers growling)

29:38.485 --> 29:39.725
Come on!

29:53.333 --> 29:54.869
Rick.

30:00.382 --> 30:02.214
What happened here?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.214
The Saviors.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.295
Well, how do we get out?

30:08.432 --> 30:10.343
Get out...

30:10.434 --> 30:12.300
how you got in.

30:12.394 --> 30:15.307
(growling continues)

30:18.233 --> 30:21.021
These weren't heaps before.

30:21.111 --> 30:23.853
It was just trash

30:23.947 --> 30:26.188
laid out, as far as the eye could see.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.076
I used to come here
to find things to paint on.

30:32.247 --> 30:34.534
Metal sheets.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.080
Fabrics.

30:38.128 --> 30:39.914
And then after...

30:40.005 --> 30:41.962
everything changed...

30:44.593 --> 30:48.382
(voice breaking)
I realized this whole place was a canvas.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.549
That we were the paint.

30:52.642 --> 30:55.259
We could create something new.

30:55.354 --> 30:57.595
We could become something new.

31:01.443 --> 31:03.025
We did.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.940
This was our world.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.947
Apart from everyone else.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.074
In every way.

31:15.123 --> 31:17.740
You did this.

31:17.834 --> 31:19.575
This is because of you.

31:42.317 --> 31:44.479
What are you doing?

31:45.195 --> 31:46.981
We're gonna run for it.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.620
Let me come with you.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.788
Just until they're gone.

32:02.421 --> 32:04.037
Nah.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.213
I'm done with her games.

32:08.593 --> 32:10.800
She can't help us, anyway.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.298
Come on.

32:36.455 --> 32:38.412
(grunting)

32:56.433 --> 32:57.844
(growling continues)

32:57.934 --> 33:00.972
Wait! Please!
Just-- Just let me get out!

33:16.036 --> 33:18.027
(growling stops)

33:35.972 --> 33:39.306
(walkers growling in distance)

33:39.392 --> 33:41.383
(thumping continues)

33:51.112 --> 33:53.649
(metal clanging)

33:53.740 --> 33:55.822
(growling continues)

34:11.757 --> 34:14.670
(chain clinking)

34:18.848 --> 34:21.840
(engine rumbling)

34:29.234 --> 34:31.771
(growling continues)

34:31.860 --> 34:34.444
(flesh tearing)

34:46.710 --> 34:48.701
(growling, tearing continue)

35:09.399 --> 35:11.481
(walkers growling)

35:14.738 --> 35:16.729
(thudding, flesh tearing)

35:21.119 --> 35:23.110
(growling, tearing continue)

35:31.755 --> 35:33.746
(metal creaking)

35:42.766 --> 35:45.053
(gunshots echo)

35:46.770 --> 35:48.761
(metal creaking)

36:00.492 --> 36:02.574
(metal creaking)

36:05.455 --> 36:07.947
(machinery whirring)

36:11.252 --> 36:13.414
(engine shuts off)

37:38.631 --> 37:40.872
(engine rumbling)

37:47.682 --> 37:50.265
I shot above her head.
I just wanted her gone.

37:51.895 --> 37:55.183
(sighs)
Look, I saw her. She made it.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.436
She ran into an empty alley
just before I left.

38:00.195 --> 38:02.903
I didn't want her dead.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.401
I just wanted her gone.

38:07.744 --> 38:10.657
Feels like what Carl was talking about.

38:12.874 --> 38:16.287
What we should do when we have a choice.

38:22.634 --> 38:24.045
(sighs)

38:24.135 --> 38:25.546
Uh...

38:28.223 --> 38:30.555
Um...

38:30.642 --> 38:32.724
I need a se-- I need a second.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.768
It's fine.

38:42.195 --> 38:44.186
(gearshift clicks)

38:46.366 --> 38:48.152
(engine shuts off)

39:19.858 --> 39:22.395
(papers rustling)

39:42.839 --> 39:45.206
(sniffles, sighs)

39:59.731 --> 40:02.393
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- Get me Negan.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.687
(walkie-talkie clicks)

40:04.777 --> 40:08.020
- D.J.: Who the hell is <i>asking?</i>
- (walkie-talkie clicks)

40:10.575 --> 40:13.317
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- It's Rick Grimes.

40:13.411 --> 40:15.322
(walkie-talkie clicks)

40:19.208 --> 40:21.825
<i>Negan:
Ricky. Look at you, callin' me up.</i>

40:21.920 --> 40:23.502
You wanna <i>tell</i> me where you are

40:23.588 --> 40:25.920
<i>so we can do this face-to-face?</i>

40:26.007 --> 40:27.918
(walkie-talkie clicks)

40:28.009 --> 40:29.841
Carl's dead.

40:32.764 --> 40:34.346
<i>He wrote letters.</i>

40:36.559 --> 40:38.345
<i>He wrote one to you.</i>

40:38.436 --> 40:42.725
<i>He asked you... to stop.</i>

40:42.815 --> 40:44.726
He asked me to stop.

40:47.111 --> 40:50.194
<i>He asked us... for peace.</i>

40:51.991 --> 40:54.403
But it's too late for that.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.368
Even if we wanted a deal now,
it doesn't matter.

41:03.378 --> 41:05.585
- I'm gonna kill you.
- (walkie-talkie clicks)

41:09.258 --> 41:11.590
- How did <i>it</i> happen?
- (walkie-talkie clicks)

41:16.557 --> 41:18.173
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- What?

41:18.267 --> 41:21.555
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- How did he die?

41:21.646 --> 41:23.557
Was it us?

41:23.648 --> 41:26.390
Was it the grenades?

41:26.484 --> 41:29.397
- The fire?
- It wasn't you.

41:32.281 --> 41:35.899
Carl went out to "help" someone.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.154
- And he got bit.
- (walkie-talkie clicks)

41:44.627 --> 41:45.992
(walkie-talkie clicks)

41:46.087 --> 41:47.703
God damn it.

41:50.216 --> 41:52.878
Shit. I, um...

41:52.969 --> 41:55.586
I am sorry.

41:55.680 --> 41:58.263
You know, I wanted him
to be part of things.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.636
I had plans. He--

42:00.727 --> 42:04.641
That kid... that kid was the future.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.018
The only future is one where you're dead.

42:07.108 --> 42:09.145
(walkie-talkie clicks)

42:09.235 --> 42:11.647
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- What the hell are you doing, <i>Rick?</i>

42:11.738 --> 42:13.945
<i>Why are you fighting?
Why are you making this so hard?</i>

42:14.032 --> 42:17.024
Carl is dead because of you.

42:17.118 --> 42:20.236
Because you couldn't leave shit
well enough alone.

42:21.289 --> 42:24.953
<i>I mean, hell, maybe he would've died
some other way.</i>

42:25.043 --> 42:27.034
<i>Any one of us can get our ticket punched
at any second.</i>

42:27.128 --> 42:28.414
<i>but in this case--</i>

42:28.504 --> 42:30.996
in this case...

42:31.090 --> 42:33.001
he is dead because of you.

42:33.092 --> 42:37.461
Because you weren't there
to stop him from doing something stupid.

42:39.515 --> 42:41.756
You set this course, Rick.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.259
Who's next?

42:44.353 --> 42:45.843
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- You are.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.521
- (walkie-talkie clicks)
- No.

42:48.608 --> 42:51.020
<i>But someone is.</i>

42:51.110 --> 42:55.024
You see, I stop people from dying.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.481
I am the answer.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.067
Now, it may have taken a hard lesson
for you to hear it,

43:00.161 --> 43:01.651
but you should hear it now.

43:01.746 --> 43:03.111
It's time.

43:03.206 --> 43:06.244
Do not let any more of
your shit decisions

43:06.334 --> 43:09.326
cost you to lose anyone else you love.

43:10.421 --> 43:13.004
That garbage...

43:13.091 --> 43:15.207
<i>that sticks with you.</i>

43:15.301 --> 43:17.087
<i>Forever.</i>

43:17.178 --> 43:19.761
<i>(sighs) Just like Carl will.</i>

43:21.766 --> 43:24.178
Hell, I'm feeling it.

43:24.268 --> 43:26.509
And I'm gonna be feeling it for a while.

43:28.940 --> 43:33.605
You could have just let me
save all of you.

43:33.694 --> 43:36.652
I mean, that's why I killed
your friends in the first place.

43:36.739 --> 43:39.356
<i>So, you can sit there and you can say</i>

43:39.450 --> 43:41.942
<i>that you're gonna kill me,
but you won't.</i>

43:43.412 --> 43:45.949
You failed.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.826
You failed as a leader,

43:47.917 --> 43:51.160
and most of all, Rick,
you failed as a father.

43:52.463 --> 43:56.331
<i>(sighs) Just give up.</i>

43:57.844 --> 44:00.552
<i>Give up, because you have already lost.</i>

44:00.638 --> 44:02.254
(walkie-talkie clicks)

44:07.979 --> 44:09.970
(theme music playing)
