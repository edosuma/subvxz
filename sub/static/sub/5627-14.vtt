WEBVTT

00:20.420 --> 00:22.670
You're gonna get us all in trouble.

00:23.710 --> 00:25.960
He's going to be home soon, okay?

00:26.250 --> 00:27.500
Stop!

00:27.500 --> 00:28.540
Rose?

00:29.250 --> 00:30.500
Rose!

00:30.500 --> 00:33.830
Don't call me that.
How many times I told you?

00:33.830 --> 00:36.920
You took that when I was watching
and he's gonna blame me.

00:38.380 --> 00:39.620
Please.

00:41.210 --> 00:43.460
-Stop that!
-Don't touch me!

01:28.420 --> 01:29.790
I'm gonna go get help.

01:29.790 --> 01:30.920
Don't go.

01:30.920 --> 01:33.330
You're sick. You need help.
I'll be back.

01:33.620 --> 01:34.670
Pinkie promise?

01:41.670 --> 01:43.250
Okay.

02:28.380 --> 02:30.330
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop her.

02:30.330 --> 02:31.670
We have to go.

02:31.670 --> 02:32.960
-Where?
-Now.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.120
I need help. I can't lift her.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.540
No. She's only gonna slow us down.

02:35.540 --> 02:37.250
-But we can't...
-Come on, put her down!

02:37.250 --> 02:39.120
Go! Now!

02:41.040 --> 02:46.000
Last night, uh, this girl, Gina Bryant,
flagged down a police car in St. Louis.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.540
She was wearing nothing but a dirty
nightgown and she was barefoot.

02:49.540 --> 02:52.540
And she told them she had been
kidnapped when she was eight.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.920
That girl's gotta be 19 or 20 years old.

02:54.920 --> 02:56.500
Eighteen.
And they confirmed her identity.

02:57.250 --> 03:00.290
She was a foster kid
who disappeared 10 years ago.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.500
She's been in captivity this whole time?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.290
Long-term hostage. That's rare.

03:04.290 --> 03:06.170
We got another Ariel Castro here?

03:06.170 --> 03:09.250
Oh. Funny you should say that.
Not funny, ha ha, funny weird.

03:09.250 --> 03:13.210
She told the police that she was held
captive with this girl, Sheila Woods,

03:13.210 --> 03:17.290
15 years old, who disappeared
from Nashville seven years ago.

03:17.290 --> 03:18.790
Also she said
there was another girl, too,

03:18.790 --> 03:21.540
but all she knows about her is that her
name is Violet and she was older.

03:21.540 --> 03:23.920
I'm assuming you've checked
the missing children's database.

03:23.920 --> 03:25.580
Affirmative. There's no Violet anywhere.

03:25.580 --> 03:27.170
Did Gina say anything
about her captor?

03:27.170 --> 03:29.540
Just that his name is Tom,
and he was an older white dude.

03:29.540 --> 03:31.500
This house.

03:31.830 --> 03:32.960
Gina took the cops there.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.880
They found Sheila.
Sheila's at the hospital,

03:34.880 --> 03:36.880
very ill with something
yet to be determined.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.040
Violet nowhere to be found.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.000
Probably safe to assume
that she's with the UnSub.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.250
Who owns the house?

03:41.250 --> 03:43.670
Oh, that's where it gets even weirder.
This woman, Clara Riggins.

03:43.670 --> 03:46.330
She's MIA,
but her checking account is active,

03:46.330 --> 03:48.670
she pays her bills on time,
and if my math is correct,

03:48.670 --> 03:50.710
she's 108 years old.

03:50.710 --> 03:52.420
I might be going out on a limb here,

03:52.420 --> 03:54.710
but I'm gonna bet she had nothing to do
with the kidnapping.

03:54.710 --> 03:57.580
Well, the real question's where is the
UnSub and this other girl, Violet?

03:57.580 --> 03:59.250
That's what
we're gonna find out.

03:59.250 --> 04:02.330
Lewis is on a research assignment.
Wheels up in 30.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.620
Can I go pee?

04:06.620 --> 04:07.670
Soon.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.120
When? We've been driving for hours.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.000
Soon. I said.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.670
I gotta go bad.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.960
-What'd I say, huh?
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'll hold it.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.120
I'll be good, I promise.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.580
Maybe I should just get rid of you.

04:26.580 --> 04:28.080
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

05:01.040 --> 05:04.790
"By the will art thou lost,
by the will art thou found,

05:04.790 --> 05:08.540
"by the will art thou free,
captive, and bound."

05:08.540 --> 05:10.750
Angelus Silesius.

05:12.750 --> 05:15.040
Both Gina and Sheila
were grabbed when they were eight.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.920
And both just blocks
away from their homes.

05:16.920 --> 05:19.290
And made a clean getaway each time.
No witnesses.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.920
There's an excellent chance
he stalked them as well.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.750
Clean getaways usually mean
they know daily routines

05:22.750 --> 05:23.960
and are familiar with the area.

05:23.960 --> 05:28.080
So this guy's patient and has a plan,
which means he has patterns, too.

05:28.080 --> 05:30.670
This guy's more than just
a preferential pedophile.

05:30.670 --> 05:31.790
His victims are children,

05:31.790 --> 05:34.420
but that's probably
more about establishing control.

05:34.420 --> 05:37.040
Long-term captivity
is what matters to him.

05:37.040 --> 05:38.880
We've seen profiles like this before.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.000
There's always a sexual
assault component to their MO.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.380
Hello, all. I just sent you

05:43.380 --> 05:46.540
the 4-1-1 on the statements
from police reports.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.460
Turns out the neighbors
haven't seen Clara Riggins in 20 years.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.580
Uh, most of them didn't even
know that she existed.

05:51.580 --> 05:53.170
But they all know who this Tom guy is.

05:53.170 --> 05:54.420
According to one lady,

05:54.420 --> 05:56.380
Tom told her
that he was Clara's grandson.

05:56.380 --> 05:57.500
But I triple-checked.

05:57.500 --> 05:58.670
Clara doesn't have
any relatives anywhere.

05:58.670 --> 06:00.330
Did we get a description
from any of the neighbors?

06:00.330 --> 06:03.580
Affirmative. And they also gave me
the make and model of Tom's blue van.

06:03.580 --> 06:07.080
It's a pretty common vehicle.
I got a long list of registered owners.

06:07.080 --> 06:10.170
So far the three Toms and Thomases
on that list all check out.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.330
All right, stay on it.-You know I will, sir.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.040
When we land, Dave, you and Morgan
go to the house.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.880
JJ, you and Reid
are with me at the hospital.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.170
We need to talk to the girls
and find out everything they remember.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.250
- -

06:26.080 --> 06:28.420
Well, she's stable for now.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.330
All we can do is wait.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.620
So, just sit tight.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.790
Agents, thank you for waiting.

06:36.790 --> 06:38.080
Of course. How is she?

06:38.080 --> 06:40.500
Looks like she had complications
from a miscarriage.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.170
Her infection turned septic

06:42.170 --> 06:44.620
and we had to perform
an emergency hysterectomy.

06:44.620 --> 06:47.040
And she has several old scars
on her back.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.920
If I didn't know better,
I'd say they were from a whip.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.580
Any idea when she might wake up?

06:50.580 --> 06:52.210
There's no way to tell.

06:52.210 --> 06:53.880
What about Gina Bryant?

06:53.880 --> 06:55.750
She's doing much better,
all things considered.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.540
Malnourished, dehydrated,
a couple nasty cuts and bruises.

06:58.540 --> 07:00.540
But she should be okay.
Physically, anyway.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.540
Do you think she's able
to answer a few questions?

07:03.540 --> 07:05.170
She was pretty agitated
when she came in,

07:05.170 --> 07:07.670
so we gave her a mild sedative.

07:07.670 --> 07:10.290
But she has the same scars
on her back,

07:10.290 --> 07:13.250
and she's got a bunch of old injuries
that didn't heal properly.

07:13.250 --> 07:16.330
Broken ribs, tibia, a couple of fingers.

07:17.290 --> 07:19.080
I hope you catch the guy who did this.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.420
Do you feel better?

07:23.420 --> 07:25.420
Much better. Thank you.

07:26.170 --> 07:27.290
Okay.

07:31.380 --> 07:32.670
Hey.

07:32.670 --> 07:33.790
Sorry I yelled.

07:33.790 --> 07:36.170
Daddy's just got a lot on his mind,
all right?

07:36.540 --> 07:37.920
It's okay.

07:53.790 --> 07:55.420
Hi, Gina.

07:55.420 --> 07:56.580
My name's Jennifer.

07:56.580 --> 07:58.420
This here is my friend, Spencer.

07:58.420 --> 07:59.540
Hi.

07:59.540 --> 08:02.620
We're with the FBI.
Do you know what that is?

08:02.620 --> 08:03.750
The police?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.290
Yeah. Something like that.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.670
I already talked to the police.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.500
Well, we're, we're a little bit different.

08:08.500 --> 08:10.040
Do you mind if we ask
you a few questions?

09:14.420 --> 09:16.250
Can you tell me about the day
you were kidnapped?

09:17.380 --> 09:19.170
I went to the park.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.250
I forgot my sweatshirt.

09:22.580 --> 09:24.080
But I didn't want to go home.

09:24.080 --> 09:25.210
Why not?

09:25.210 --> 09:27.040
That lady, Trisha, was mean.

09:27.040 --> 09:29.960
Your foster mother, Trisha

09:29.960 --> 09:31.080
Her kids, too.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.420
They said I wasn't worth the money
they made off me.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.380
So you went to the playground
to get away from them.

09:36.380 --> 09:38.540
I went all kinds of places.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.250
But mostly there.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.420
What happened that day?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.120
Violet.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.080
The girl you were held hostage with?

09:51.580 --> 09:54.080
She was waiting for her dad
to pick her up.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.210
And that's when he came.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.330
Who, Tom?

09:58.330 --> 10:00.250
Hey, girls, look what I have.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.290
He had this little puppy.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.250
He asked me if I wanted
to give him treats.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.080
He said he went crazy for treats.

10:06.080 --> 10:07.960
They were in his car.

10:08.290 --> 10:10.290
But it wasn't a car.

10:10.290 --> 10:12.080
It was a van.

10:12.080 --> 10:16.420
And he opened the door and he
pushed me in, and he hit me.

10:17.040 --> 10:20.250
I tasted my blood,
and my eyes were watery.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.170
And he said I'd better listen,
or he was gonna hit me again.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.380
We drove...

10:27.790 --> 10:29.880
We drove for a long time.

10:30.620 --> 10:32.830
But I never saw
the puppy again, though.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.330
Never saw it.

10:34.330 --> 10:35.710
He was so little.

10:36.290 --> 10:39.000
I don't know
where he went, though. I'm sorry.

10:39.830 --> 10:42.080
It's okay. It's, it's okay.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.460
-I'm sorry.
-Shh.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.880
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.710
Look what I found In the kitchen.

11:00.620 --> 11:02.120
Bondage and torture porn.

11:02.420 --> 11:04.830
Also found another toolbox in there.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.040
That makes three.

11:06.040 --> 11:07.210
Well, you saw the guy's woodwork.

11:07.210 --> 11:08.670
He's obviously good with his hands.

11:08.670 --> 11:12.040
So maybe some kind of
carpenter or handyman.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.210
Check this out.

11:13.500 --> 11:14.790
It could be OCD.

11:14.790 --> 11:17.000
I mean, his closet is just right.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.120
Clothes are perfectly folded

11:18.120 --> 11:20.210
and you can bounce
a quarter off his bed.

11:20.210 --> 11:23.420
He wants total control over every aspect
of his life.

11:23.420 --> 11:24.920
Makes sense for a sadist.

11:24.920 --> 11:27.750
He's not gonna like being on the run.
He's gonna feel powerless.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.540
And that's why he took Violet with him.

11:29.540 --> 11:32.040
Sheila Woods was probably
too sick to travel.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.330
You know, Violet was the oldest
and helped with the abductions.

11:35.330 --> 11:36.790
She was probably his first victim.

11:37.170 --> 11:38.620
Or maybe his daughter.

11:38.620 --> 11:41.500
Well, either way,
she was important to him.

11:41.500 --> 11:46.380
You know, I also wonder,
what happened to Clara Riggins?

11:46.380 --> 11:48.960
Well, the bedroom down the hall
was untouched.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.420
Looks like it's been that way for a while.

11:50.420 --> 11:52.000
And this house is well cared for.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.290
He looked after it.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.540
That could be how he found this place.

11:55.540 --> 11:59.880
Elderly woman with no family hires
someone to fix things now and then.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.460
He's a nice guy. He does good work.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.170
They build a relationship.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.750
You think he took advantage
of Clara Riggins?

12:06.750 --> 12:08.210
Yeah.

12:08.210 --> 12:10.170
Right before he murdered her.

12:10.170 --> 12:12.620
I don't know, Rossi.
This guy doesn't profile as a killer.

12:12.620 --> 12:13.670
He likes the long game.

12:14.670 --> 12:17.000
So maybe he just insinuates
himself into her life,

12:17.000 --> 12:18.750
and waits for her to die.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.710
And he made sure that she came
to depend on him for survival

12:20.710 --> 12:21.750
just like his victims.

12:24.670 --> 12:27.120
Gina, do you have any idea
where Tom might be right now?

12:27.120 --> 12:29.380
Maybe his disappearing place.

12:29.380 --> 12:30.830
His disappearing place?

12:30.830 --> 12:33.290
He'd always leave.
I liked it when he was gone,

12:33.290 --> 12:34.920
even though he never left much food.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.620
Do you know where
the disappearing place is?

12:36.620 --> 12:40.460
I didn't get to go.
He only took Violet and Sheila once.

12:40.460 --> 12:41.710
They were more special.

12:42.290 --> 12:44.670
Why were they more special?

12:44.670 --> 12:46.080
Because they were good.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.790
They never fought.

12:47.790 --> 12:49.080
But you did.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.250
I hated to call him "Daddy",
and I wouldn't say my name.

12:52.250 --> 12:53.750
What do you mean,
you wouldn't say your name?

12:53.750 --> 12:54.920
Rose.

12:55.170 --> 12:57.040
He tried to call me that.

12:57.040 --> 13:00.170
Did Sheila or Violet every talk
about the disappearing place?

13:00.170 --> 13:03.210
It was a secret.
It would make Tom mad if they did.

13:03.210 --> 13:05.330
Well, what about Tom

13:06.460 --> 13:07.960
One time.

13:07.960 --> 13:09.670
When he was nice.

13:10.210 --> 13:11.250
He brought pizza.

13:12.080 --> 13:13.420
Do you remember what he said?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.380
That maybe one day I could go.

13:16.620 --> 13:17.960
Then...

13:19.420 --> 13:21.880
Then he wanted
to go behind the curtain.

13:28.120 --> 13:31.080
Sometimes I didn't fight
as much after Sheila got there.

13:31.080 --> 13:32.210
Why not?

13:32.210 --> 13:33.880
Because we had to take care of her.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.540
So I tried to make him happy.

13:35.540 --> 13:38.500
But I made sure she remembered
her real name, no matter what.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.670
What about Violet

13:41.380 --> 13:42.460
Hmm...

13:44.460 --> 13:46.330
Just... Just Violet.

13:46.330 --> 13:47.750
Sometimes he called her Vi.

13:47.750 --> 13:50.210
Did Tom ever mention
anyone named Clara?

13:51.420 --> 13:52.790
She liked flowers.

13:52.790 --> 13:54.120
That's where we got our names.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.620
He called Sheila, Daisy.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.710
Did you ever see Clara?

13:58.830 --> 13:59.920
No.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.540
But sometimes I was good,

14:04.380 --> 14:09.120
and he let me go outside at night time,
and we planted flowers.

14:10.290 --> 14:11.830
He said they were for Clara.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.250
No, it was...

14:25.250 --> 14:26.670
It was just like any other day.

14:26.670 --> 14:29.790
I made her lunch, I kissed her goodbye,

14:29.790 --> 14:32.210
and then her school called
wondering where she was.

14:32.750 --> 14:34.210
Is there anyone you'd
like me to contact?

14:34.540 --> 14:35.960
Her father.

14:36.290 --> 14:37.420
He's in Tampa.

14:37.420 --> 14:40.040
We split up after Sheila disappeared.

14:40.670 --> 14:42.620
Who did this to her?

14:42.620 --> 14:43.920
Who?

14:43.920 --> 14:45.750
Rest assured, we're doing everything
we can to find him.

14:49.960 --> 14:53.380
So this one right here
will turn the volume up and down.

14:53.380 --> 14:55.380
And then this one
if you want to change the channel,

14:55.380 --> 14:56.540
if you want to watch
something different.

14:56.540 --> 14:57.830
JJ.

14:57.830 --> 15:00.250
Here you go. I'll be right back.

15:02.330 --> 15:03.830
Composite sketch of the UnSub.

15:03.830 --> 15:07.580
Garcia's running facial recognition
against her list of blue van owners.

15:07.580 --> 15:09.250
How's she doing?

15:09.250 --> 15:10.670
It's a lot.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.960
She has no money, no family,

15:12.960 --> 15:14.120
a second-grade education,

15:14.120 --> 15:16.210
not to mention a lifetime
of PTSD to deal with.

15:16.210 --> 15:18.620
Excuse me.
Clear the door, clear the door, please.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.540
103. Code blue.
Dr. Givens, room 103.

15:21.540 --> 15:22.710
That can't be good.-Code blue.

15:22.710 --> 15:23.830
Crash cart coming through.

15:23.830 --> 15:26.170
Given the amount of hospital staff
and the level of urgency,

15:26.170 --> 15:27.710
it looks to me like Sheila
might be coding.

15:27.710 --> 15:28.830
What's coding?

15:29.710 --> 15:31.750
Gina, you need to get back in bed.

15:31.750 --> 15:33.040
Is that Sheila's room?

15:33.040 --> 15:35.120
Oh, no, no, no. Okay, you know what?

15:35.120 --> 15:37.580
Let them work.
You don't want to get in their way.

15:37.580 --> 15:39.540
No! You don't stop working on her!

15:39.540 --> 15:40.670
You do not let her die!

15:40.670 --> 15:42.920
-Sheila, is she okay?
-No, no, no.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.500
It's okay.

15:44.500 --> 15:45.830
What's wrong with her?

15:45.830 --> 15:48.710
I have to help her!
I have to help her!

15:48.710 --> 15:51.670
Please! Please! Please.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.000
Oh... Oh.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.170
What have you got, Garcia?

16:06.170 --> 16:08.080
I have a big, fat hit on our UnSub.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.670
I give you Michael Clark Thompson,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.830
owner of Mike's Fix-It and Construction,

16:13.830 --> 16:17.330
and there's a blue van registered
in the company's name.

16:17.330 --> 16:18.500
You sent the address?

16:18.500 --> 16:21.500
No, it's a PO Box, sir,
and his cell phone is turned off.

16:21.500 --> 16:24.040
But it last pinged
last night in St. Louis,

16:24.040 --> 16:25.580
right next to Clara Riggins' house.

16:25.580 --> 16:26.920
Is this him?

16:26.920 --> 16:29.040
Yeah. Get it away, please.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.170
I'll issue the APB.

16:47.330 --> 16:48.540
Here.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.920
Eat. I know you're hungry.

16:50.920 --> 16:52.620
Can we please go see them?

16:52.620 --> 16:54.670
Just shut up
and eat your cheeseburger.

17:03.830 --> 17:05.830
Now, listen.
Just let me sleep for a little while,

17:05.830 --> 17:07.500
then I'll, I'll take you to see them.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.620
Okay. Okay. Yeah, I'll be quiet.

17:09.620 --> 17:11.250
I'll be quiet as a mouse.

17:11.920 --> 17:14.040
I just need a few minutes.

17:14.380 --> 17:15.790
Sweet dreams.

17:15.790 --> 17:17.290
I thought you said you'd be quiet.

17:22.670 --> 17:25.080
Michael Clark Thompson's
mother died in childbirth,

17:25.080 --> 17:26.500
so he grew up with his father, Nate,

17:26.500 --> 17:28.670
who was married and divorced
five different times.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.670
And each of his exes
filed for divorce

17:30.670 --> 17:33.380
on the grounds of cruelty,
adultery, or both.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.960
Apparently his father had a predilection
for prostitutes.

17:35.960 --> 17:38.790
He was even arrested once
for having assaulted one.

17:38.790 --> 17:40.540
Now, kids do what they see.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.710
This might explain the son's
extreme misogynistic tendencies.

17:43.710 --> 17:44.830
And his violent streak.

17:44.830 --> 17:47.000
The apple doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.710
Now, this man is smart,
and he's manipulative.

17:49.710 --> 17:52.330
He not only was able to take advantage
of the woman who owns this house,

17:52.330 --> 17:55.120
but he's somehow held three girls
hostage here for over a decade.

17:55.120 --> 17:57.250
That took effort and dedication.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.830
This was important to him,
like a compulsion.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.620
He gets off on having
absolute power and control.

18:02.620 --> 18:05.830
All units
be advised, APB suspect's blue van

18:05.830 --> 18:08.620
spotted on Taft Avenue
and Buckley Road.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.920
That's him.

18:28.710 --> 18:30.420
Michael Clark Thompson, FBI!

18:30.420 --> 18:31.620
Show me your hands!

18:31.620 --> 18:32.750
Daddy, who is that?

18:32.750 --> 18:34.080
Show me your hands!

18:34.080 --> 18:37.000
Now, very slowly, use your right hand
to open the driver's side door.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.460
Daddy?

18:38.460 --> 18:40.080
Remember what I told you.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.460
That if anybody ever found us,

18:43.460 --> 18:45.670
Daddy's the only one that loves you.

18:45.670 --> 18:47.330
Get out of the van
nice and slow.

18:47.330 --> 18:50.040
Keep your hands where I can see them.

18:52.540 --> 18:55.080
Oh, you gotta be kidding me, this guy.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.250
Oh! My wrist! My wrist!

19:04.620 --> 19:06.960
-Oh, what, am I hurting you? I'm sorry.
-

19:08.120 --> 19:09.420
Shut up.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.580
It's okay. It's okay.

19:20.170 --> 19:21.710
We got you.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.500
She's refusing treatment.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.880
She won't even tell us her last name.

19:25.880 --> 19:27.830
Well, that's because she might
not even remember it herself.

19:27.830 --> 19:29.620
Violet probably
isn't even her real name.

19:29.620 --> 19:31.290
It's most likely the name he gave her.

19:31.290 --> 19:32.420
We do need to talk to her.

19:32.420 --> 19:34.830
Well, you can try.
You might have better luck than I did.

19:34.830 --> 19:36.880
It may take some time
to get through to her.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.120
All right, see what you can find out.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.670
I'm gonna go question Thompson.

19:39.670 --> 19:42.330
She's probably childlike
and unsocialized, exactly like Gina.

19:42.330 --> 19:44.120
And if she was held captive the longest,

19:44.120 --> 19:47.580
she almost certainly
fell victim to intense trauma bonding.

19:49.040 --> 19:51.170
Hi. Violet?

19:51.710 --> 19:52.880
My name's Jennifer.

19:52.880 --> 19:54.080
And I'm Spencer.

19:54.080 --> 19:56.540
Uh, can we go now?

19:56.540 --> 19:58.040
Me and my daddy, we gotta go.

19:59.040 --> 20:01.170
When you say daddy,
do you mean Tom?

20:02.210 --> 20:04.420
I don't call him that.

20:04.420 --> 20:07.460
You know, that's not,
that's not actually his real name.

20:07.460 --> 20:09.250
His name is Michael Clark Thompson.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.120
Tom's just a name he made up.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.460
Kind of like your name. Violet.

20:13.460 --> 20:15.040
Do you remember your real name?

20:17.620 --> 20:19.290
I need my daddy. We need to go.

20:20.250 --> 20:22.170
Where is it that you need to go?
Maybe we can help you.

20:24.620 --> 20:26.420
He said you would do that.

20:26.670 --> 20:27.830
Do what?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.380
Ask questions and lie.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.710
Especially about him.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.620
We know what he did to you, Violet.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.710
Gina told us everything.

20:38.620 --> 20:40.170
You found her?

20:41.420 --> 20:43.330
Did you find Daisy, too?

20:44.880 --> 20:47.210
Her real name is Sheila. Sheila Woods.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.250
And, yes, we did.

20:49.500 --> 20:52.330
She was super sick. Is she okay?

20:52.330 --> 20:55.790
I'm sorry, but, no, she's not.

20:55.790 --> 20:59.790
The doctors did everything they could,
but she didn't make it.

21:00.170 --> 21:01.380
She died.

21:10.540 --> 21:13.580
You don't have to be
afraid of him any more.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.580
- -We can help you.

21:15.580 --> 21:17.620
He said you would say that, too.

21:17.620 --> 21:19.170
You don't know anything, okay?

21:19.420 --> 21:21.040
I would be dead without him.

21:21.040 --> 21:22.330
He's the only one who loves me.

21:22.330 --> 21:23.460
Violet, please.

21:23.460 --> 21:26.120
I... I gotta go. Please.

21:26.540 --> 21:29.120
I've been good.
I haven't done anything bad.

21:29.120 --> 21:30.620
Can I go now?

21:31.120 --> 21:32.380
Please.

21:39.330 --> 21:40.670
I gave them a good life.

21:40.670 --> 21:41.960
They were clothed, fed.

21:41.960 --> 21:43.750
You repeatedly raped
and tortured them.

21:43.750 --> 21:44.960
Children need discipline.

21:44.960 --> 21:46.540
Now, if you have kids yourself,
you know what...

21:46.540 --> 21:48.880
That wasn't discipline
and they're not your children.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.670
The hell they weren't. I saved them.

21:51.500 --> 21:52.620
From what?

21:52.620 --> 21:53.790
From their parents.

21:54.250 --> 21:55.750
Nobody cared about them.

21:55.750 --> 21:57.290
Where were they when I showed up?

21:57.290 --> 21:59.330
No one cared about them but me.

21:59.670 --> 22:01.000
What about Clara Riggins?

22:02.330 --> 22:03.460
She was a nice lady.

22:03.460 --> 22:05.330
-Who seems to have disappeared.
-Uh-huh.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.250
I didn't kill her.

22:07.250 --> 22:08.540
I didn't say that you did.

22:08.540 --> 22:11.210
No, but obviously
that's, that's what you're thinking.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.670
So where is she?

22:13.960 --> 22:16.830
I went to check on her one day,
and she didn't answer the door.

22:16.830 --> 22:20.960
I had the key, so I... I let myself in
and I found her

22:20.960 --> 22:22.710
just lying on the kitchen floor.

22:22.710 --> 22:25.000
So I put her in the yard.
That's what she would have wanted.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.500
Look, she loved that house.

22:26.500 --> 22:28.880
She didn't want to be buried
next to strangers.

22:28.880 --> 22:30.540
You, you can go check if you want.

22:30.540 --> 22:32.210
I told you, I've got nothing to hide.

22:33.250 --> 22:35.580
Nothing to hide, my ass.
He's full of it.

22:35.580 --> 22:37.500
The preliminary M.E. report
does suggest

22:37.500 --> 22:39.000
that Clara Riggins
died of natural causes.

22:39.000 --> 22:40.330
I think he's telling
the truth about that.

22:40.330 --> 22:41.500
He didn't kill her.

22:41.500 --> 22:44.170
I'm sorry, guys.
I, I can't stop thinking about Violet.

22:44.170 --> 22:46.670
She could not wait to get out of here,
like it was urgent.

22:46.670 --> 22:47.830
It's all she could talk about.

22:47.830 --> 22:49.500
Well, she'd been held
captive most of her life.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.330
All this has to be a tremendous shock.

22:51.330 --> 22:53.880
No question about that,
but that wasn't it.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.710
It's like she had somewhere specific
in mind,

22:55.710 --> 22:57.250
and she needed Thompson
to go with her.

22:57.250 --> 22:59.500
Well, he's conditioned her
to depend on him for everything.

22:59.500 --> 23:03.420
Exactly. You condition someone by
doing something over and over again.

23:03.420 --> 23:04.830
Now, we know he repeatedly
abused them.

23:04.830 --> 23:07.210
I don't think she was itching
to get out of here to go do that.

23:07.670 --> 23:10.210
Maybe he did something
to reward her somehow.

23:11.580 --> 23:12.830
What if she has a child?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.330
Where else would you
want to go so badly?

23:15.330 --> 23:16.790
You know, that's not a stretch.

23:16.790 --> 23:18.420
Sheila Woods had a miscarriage.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.420
Maybe Violet brought one to term.

23:20.420 --> 23:22.500
We did profile he might be trying to fill
some kind of void

23:22.500 --> 23:24.040
since he didn't have a family.

23:24.040 --> 23:28.080
Yeah, but Gina Bryant
never mentioned any baby.

23:28.080 --> 23:30.620
Well, Violet could have had the baby
before Gina was abducted.

23:30.620 --> 23:31.880
Gina wouldn't even know about it.

23:31.880 --> 23:33.670
Well, if we're right
about any of this,

23:33.670 --> 23:36.920
that means there's another
kid somewhere out there.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.040
Then who's taking care of it?

23:38.040 --> 23:40.210
I wove
my webs for you because I liked you.

23:40.210 --> 23:42.290
After all, what's a life anyway?

23:42.290 --> 23:45.250
We're born,
we live a little while, we die.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.620
A spider's life can't help
being something of a mess,

23:47.620 --> 23:49.710
with all this trapping and eating flies.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.040
I don't want to listen any more.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.080
I'm hungry.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.380
I know. Me, too.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.120
You want to sing?

24:01.580 --> 24:02.710
How about ABCs?

24:02.710 --> 24:03.750
You remember it?

24:04.210 --> 24:05.250
Yeah.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.040
Don't worry.
I'll be right there with you.

24:24.040 --> 24:25.540
Don't leave.

24:25.540 --> 24:26.920
I promise.

24:31.250 --> 24:33.250
Excuse me, Mrs. Woods.

24:33.250 --> 24:38.040
I am so sorry to interrupt here,
but this is Gina.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.420
She was with Sheila.

24:49.620 --> 24:51.000
I'm sorry.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.880
I tried to help her.

24:52.880 --> 24:54.170
I tried.

25:04.380 --> 25:05.540
Yeah, Garcia.

25:05.540 --> 25:07.170
Sir, I think I found
who Violet is.

25:07.170 --> 25:08.960
The timeline matches,
the geography matches,

25:08.960 --> 25:10.830
everything matches.

25:10.830 --> 25:13.040
Hi.

25:13.540 --> 25:14.920
You okay?

25:14.920 --> 25:17.290
How is Daddy

25:17.290 --> 25:20.040
Um... We're working on it.

25:20.040 --> 25:22.670
You know what, I still have
a few questions I need to ask you.

25:22.670 --> 25:23.830
Okay?

25:24.250 --> 25:26.420
-What's that thing?
-Um...

25:26.420 --> 25:29.120
Well, you can look at pictures on it.

25:31.420 --> 25:33.670
Do you know this little girl?

25:36.120 --> 25:38.500
Her name is Amelia Hawthorne,

25:38.500 --> 25:41.250
and she is from a city
called Indianapolis.

25:41.830 --> 25:45.330
And these... These are her parents.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.000
That's George and Maureen.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.620
That little girl is you.

25:54.790 --> 25:56.330
You're Amelia.

26:07.330 --> 26:08.880
Um...

26:08.880 --> 26:10.210
My name is Violet.

26:10.210 --> 26:11.880
No, sweetie.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.210
Tom took you away from your family
when you were only eight.

26:15.710 --> 26:18.330
You have been gone for 15 years.

26:18.330 --> 26:20.210
Tom is not your daddy.

26:20.790 --> 26:22.750
This man is.

26:24.790 --> 26:27.710
I... I can't even begin

26:27.710 --> 26:29.540
to understand what
you're feeling right now,

26:29.540 --> 26:32.710
but you must be scared and confused.

26:33.170 --> 26:37.080
I promise you, Amelia, I am your friend.

26:37.670 --> 26:39.790
Okay? And I'm here to help you.

26:40.120 --> 26:42.880
But you gotta trust me. Okay?

26:44.250 --> 26:45.420
Okay.

26:45.920 --> 26:47.460
Can you do me a favor?

26:48.580 --> 26:52.460
I need you to think back
and try really hard to remember.

26:52.790 --> 26:55.040
Did Tom...

26:56.750 --> 26:58.670
Did he ever get you pregnant?

26:59.710 --> 27:02.080
Did you have a baby, Amelia?

27:03.380 --> 27:05.830
-I can't talk about that. He gets mad.
-He's not here.

27:05.830 --> 27:08.380
He gets mad if I even ask about...

27:08.380 --> 27:12.420
Hey. I promised you,
I am here to help you.

27:12.920 --> 27:17.670
Which means you never,
ever have to worry about him again.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.330
My sisters.

27:27.250 --> 27:28.540
Your sisters?

27:30.710 --> 27:33.620
I got super sick.

27:34.170 --> 27:36.670
And then my belly got really big
both times.

27:36.670 --> 27:39.080
Both times

27:39.670 --> 27:42.210
And then one day, they just...

27:43.500 --> 27:44.540
Came out.

27:45.420 --> 27:50.040
And it really hurt like crazy,
but I got my sisters.

27:51.620 --> 27:53.790
Lily and Jasmine.

27:54.460 --> 27:56.210
Do you know where they are right now?

27:56.210 --> 27:58.710
Yeah, of course.
They're in the disappearing place.

27:58.710 --> 28:01.040
Do you know where that is?
I can take you there.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.830
Well, we have to drive. Can you drive?

28:02.830 --> 28:04.170
Yeah, but you need
to tell me where to go.

28:04.170 --> 28:05.330
Can you do that?

28:05.330 --> 28:07.620
No, I don't know,
I don't know where it is.

28:07.620 --> 28:09.750
I always sit in back. He drives.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.120
But you might remember
more than you think.

28:11.120 --> 28:13.170
No. Daddy knows. He can drive.

28:13.170 --> 28:16.330
Just go and get him.
Go get him, and we can go.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.960
Go ahead. Take it.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.620
-What about you?
-I'm okay.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.460
They'll be back soon.

28:35.210 --> 28:36.380
Here.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.120
Thanks.

28:45.420 --> 28:46.670
All right.

28:49.500 --> 28:52.500
The x-ray machine was down.
Thompson's going in now.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.670
Amelia Hawthorne's parents are here.

28:54.670 --> 28:56.420
She could barely look at their photo.

28:56.420 --> 28:58.460
I can't imagine how she'll react
in person.

28:58.460 --> 29:00.580
Wait. Maybe we should
give her more time.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.750
Psych hasn't completed
a full evaluation yet.

29:02.750 --> 29:04.460
I mean, she could become hostile

29:04.460 --> 29:06.620
or maybe even retreat
into a catatonic state.

29:06.620 --> 29:07.880
We don't have time.

29:07.880 --> 29:09.830
Amelia may have information
about the missing children

29:09.830 --> 29:11.170
that her parents could help unlock.

29:11.170 --> 29:13.250
It's a calculated risk,
but one I think we have to take.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.420
I'll go update them.

29:14.420 --> 29:15.580
Okay.

29:23.620 --> 29:24.710
Hi.

29:25.080 --> 29:27.330
Did you get Daddy

29:27.330 --> 29:28.580
Uh, no, not yet.

29:28.580 --> 29:29.620
Why not?

29:30.620 --> 29:34.120
Uh, there's... There's some people here
that would like to see you.

29:42.210 --> 29:43.460
Amelia.

29:45.540 --> 29:46.620
Who are they?

29:46.880 --> 29:48.250
They're your real parents.

29:48.250 --> 29:50.540
Baby, it's me. It's Mama.

29:54.290 --> 29:55.830
I don't know you.

29:55.830 --> 29:57.920
I know. I look different.

29:59.080 --> 30:00.460
So do you.

30:02.670 --> 30:04.460
I don't know them.

30:13.710 --> 30:16.500
See? That's how I looked back then.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.210
And that's your dad.

30:20.250 --> 30:24.460
And that right there is you.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.380
Do you remember?

30:33.540 --> 30:34.830
-Oh... -Don't touch me.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.710
Melly.

30:38.620 --> 30:40.420
What did you say?

30:40.880 --> 30:42.170
Melly.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.960
It's what I used to call you.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.210
It's short for Amelia.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.330
All right, get a hit, Melly.

30:48.210 --> 30:50.460
Daddy's the only one that loves you.

30:50.460 --> 30:51.960
Daddy, Daddy.

30:52.210 --> 30:53.460
Get out.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.460
-Baby...
-Get out! Get out! Get out!

30:55.460 --> 30:58.920
Get out! Get out! Get out! Now!

30:58.920 --> 31:00.290
Now! Get out!

31:00.290 --> 31:01.880
I want to go home!

31:01.880 --> 31:03.040
I want my daddy!

31:03.040 --> 31:04.710
I need my daddy!

31:05.960 --> 31:07.000
Excuse us, please.

31:10.580 --> 31:11.710
I don't think he was done.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.580
We know that Sheila Woods
got pregnant and miscarried.

31:15.170 --> 31:16.620
She preferred to be called Daisy.

31:16.620 --> 31:18.420
And we know about Lily and Jasmine.

31:18.420 --> 31:20.000
Where are they?

31:23.040 --> 31:24.670
I want a deal.

31:25.920 --> 31:27.460
Tell me where they are,
and I will make sure

31:27.460 --> 31:28.880
the court knows you cooperated.

31:28.880 --> 31:29.960
No.

31:30.250 --> 31:31.580
No, no, no.

31:31.580 --> 31:33.170
I want a deal.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.000
If we find them alive,
then we can discuss terms.

31:39.000 --> 31:40.170
Listen to me.

31:40.170 --> 31:41.960
The only reason I haven't asked
for a lawyer yet,

31:41.960 --> 31:44.000
is because I hate those
lying sons of bitches.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.380
Now, you either give me
a damn deal right now

31:46.380 --> 31:47.960
or I ain't sayin' boo.

31:50.500 --> 31:51.540
What do you want?

31:51.790 --> 31:53.330
That's better.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.750
I want to do my time
in minimum security.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.880
One of those places
where they send the white-collar guys

32:00.880 --> 32:03.210
with the, the TVs and the gyms.

32:03.210 --> 32:05.250
And no life sentence.

32:05.250 --> 32:07.080
I won't die in there.

32:07.080 --> 32:08.750
-Is that all?
-No.

32:08.750 --> 32:09.960
I want to see Violet.

32:09.960 --> 32:11.080
That's not happening.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.460
Come on. What are you telling me?

32:12.460 --> 32:15.080
She didn't ask for me, not even once?

32:16.830 --> 32:18.040
Okay. All right.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.290
You let your pride get in the way.

32:20.290 --> 32:23.380
Lily, Jasmine, I only left them enough
water for a few days

32:23.380 --> 32:25.880
and I've been gone almost a week.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.540
But that's on your head, not mine.

32:32.920 --> 32:35.420
Are we really gonna
make a deal with this guy?

32:35.420 --> 32:37.880
-I don't think we have a choice.
-

32:37.880 --> 32:40.960
You think he's telling the truth
about their food and water?

32:40.960 --> 32:42.790
I do. And I think
we're running out of time.

32:44.000 --> 32:46.750
Are we even sure the AUSA
will approve a deal?

32:46.750 --> 32:48.290
They just did.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.540
Well, do her parents know about this?

32:51.540 --> 32:53.170
JJ's talking to them now.

32:53.170 --> 32:55.080
I think I have a way
to use their presence

32:55.080 --> 32:56.580
to try to get through to her.

33:04.330 --> 33:06.750
I'm so sorry, I just can't...

33:07.580 --> 33:10.210
I just can't leave her yet.

33:10.210 --> 33:13.500
I understand.
Take as much time as you need.

33:16.040 --> 33:17.500
Is that him?

33:18.290 --> 33:19.460
Yes.

33:34.290 --> 33:36.210
-Daddy.
-Hi, Vi.

33:36.920 --> 33:38.210
Have a seat.

33:38.210 --> 33:39.830
No, I want to be close to her.

33:39.830 --> 33:41.880
Not part of the deal.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.330
Then give us some privacy.

33:43.330 --> 33:45.080
Not part of the deal, either.

33:45.080 --> 33:46.210
Sit.

33:47.290 --> 33:49.040
You got five minutes.

33:54.460 --> 33:55.620
You're hurt.

33:55.620 --> 33:58.330
Don't worry about that.
It's nothing.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.040
I'm really sorry.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.580
-About what?
-My sisters.

34:07.170 --> 34:09.250
I had to tell them.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.670
Please, don't be mad.

34:10.670 --> 34:11.710
I had to.

34:12.380 --> 34:15.040
Now, listen, it's all right, Vi.
Okay? It really is okay.

34:16.250 --> 34:18.580
Did you get the groceries yet?

34:19.670 --> 34:23.040
No, honey, I've been here
the whole time just like you.

34:23.040 --> 34:24.380
Okay, then, can we go now?

34:25.460 --> 34:26.830
I have some bad news.

34:26.830 --> 34:29.080
We can't go there today.

34:29.080 --> 34:30.710
We, we can't go there ever again.

34:30.710 --> 34:32.750
But, no, we, we have to go to the store,

34:32.750 --> 34:34.830
and it's close
by the disappearing place.

34:34.830 --> 34:36.210
And we can be fast.

34:36.210 --> 34:39.460
You're right, you're right,
Violet, but I can't.

34:39.830 --> 34:42.830
These police,
they don't think we should be together.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.290
They're gonna break apart our family
just like I told you they would.

34:46.420 --> 34:47.500
No.

34:48.330 --> 34:49.830
I just wanted to come in
and say goodbye

34:49.830 --> 34:51.080
before they took me away.

34:51.080 --> 34:53.500
Wait, when will you be back?

34:53.500 --> 34:55.750
Not for a very long time.

34:55.750 --> 34:57.500
A very long time.

34:58.120 --> 35:01.620
I would give you a hug goodbye,
but they... They won't let me.

35:01.620 --> 35:04.420
No! I... Please...

35:04.420 --> 35:06.460
Please, can I just hug him?

35:08.750 --> 35:09.830
Okay.

35:11.290 --> 35:13.500
Oh...

35:13.830 --> 35:16.000
Oh, Violet, I'm gonna miss you.

35:18.380 --> 35:19.710
My beautiful Violet.

35:20.830 --> 35:22.380
My beautiful Violet.

35:32.420 --> 35:34.670
What is... What is this

35:35.250 --> 35:37.000
These are her parents.

35:37.000 --> 35:40.330
And that gentleman right
there is her real daddy.

35:40.330 --> 35:41.420
Huh.

35:41.920 --> 35:44.250
She knows who her real daddy is.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.790
Daddy is the only one who loves you.

35:47.120 --> 35:48.580
Isn't that right, Violet?

35:55.500 --> 35:57.540
I love you, Melly.
I love you, Melly.

35:57.540 --> 35:58.620
No.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.920
My name is

36:06.750 --> 36:07.790
Amelia.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.250
Amelia.

36:13.540 --> 36:14.830
Amelia.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.250
-Amelia!
-

36:17.250 --> 36:20.290
-No! No!
-My name's Amelia!

36:20.290 --> 36:22.290
You hear me? Amelia!

36:22.290 --> 36:24.620
There's no deal. You hear me?
There's no deal!

36:29.210 --> 36:31.540
-Thank...
-

36:41.040 --> 36:43.380
Okay, so, this is a little
bit of a long shot,

36:43.380 --> 36:47.830
but you said Violet asked if Thompson
had gotten the groceries yet?

36:47.830 --> 36:50.500
Yeah, she said the store
was right by the disappearing place.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.210
Well, we profiled he's a control freak.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.080
He likes order,
which means there's a good chance

36:54.080 --> 36:56.120
he went to the same
grocery store every time.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.170
If we can figure out which one,
we can narrow the search.

36:58.170 --> 37:00.040
Well, he would need
the same kind of space,

37:00.040 --> 37:01.460
and he would want it close.

37:02.620 --> 37:03.790
Sir, yes, sir.

37:03.790 --> 37:06.330
Garcia, I need a list of clients
of Michael Clark Thompson in the area.

37:06.330 --> 37:08.000
Methinks I can do that. Let's see.

37:08.000 --> 37:10.210
Bank accounts, invoices...

37:10.210 --> 37:13.000
Bam. Eighty-three names.
That is a scary long list.

37:13.000 --> 37:16.040
All right, Garcia, you can eliminate
anyone under the age of 70.

37:16.040 --> 37:18.120
And they wouldn't just
need to be elderly clients.

37:18.120 --> 37:20.250
They could also be disabled
in some way.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.290
-Anyone he could take advantage of.-Oh.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.000
Twelve names, then.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.960
How many of them
live near a grocery store?

37:25.960 --> 37:28.040
Define near.-Uh, within a mile.

37:28.040 --> 37:33.000
Well, there are 163 grocery stores
in the greater St. Louis area.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.790
Two of them do.
First up is 91-year-old Herman Coker.

37:36.790 --> 37:39.670
He is a retired cop, World War II vet.

37:39.670 --> 37:40.790
No, I don't think it's him

37:40.790 --> 37:43.420
because he's got a very
active Facebook account,

37:43.420 --> 37:45.830
thanks to his youngest daughter, Jan,
who lives with him.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.290
Okay, who else you got, mama?

37:47.290 --> 37:49.960
Hold yourself. Fredna Nasee.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.380
Oh, not much on her.

37:51.380 --> 37:53.830
She's a retired nurse, 84 years old.

37:53.830 --> 37:56.330
She's got a daughter
that lives in Boca Raton.

37:56.330 --> 37:58.790
Uh, they... They don't communicate.

37:58.790 --> 38:00.040
No phone calls, no emails, nothing.

38:00.040 --> 38:02.330
Send us the address.-Done.

38:02.330 --> 38:03.580
Morgan and JJ, check it out.

38:11.120 --> 38:12.960
FBI!

38:18.040 --> 38:19.170
Clear.

38:19.170 --> 38:21.500
Wake up. I think they're here.

38:21.830 --> 38:22.960
Clear!

38:26.120 --> 38:27.620
Jasmine, wake up.

38:28.500 --> 38:29.670
Wake up, somebody's here.

38:29.670 --> 38:31.420
Jasmine, wake up!

38:31.420 --> 38:33.420
-Jasmine, wake up! Wake up!
-

38:36.710 --> 38:38.880
It's okay. It's okay. We're here to help.

38:38.880 --> 38:41.000
Are you Lily

38:41.000 --> 38:42.120
I can't wake her up.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.080
I'll call for an ambulance.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.170
I missed you so much!

38:59.000 --> 39:00.460
I'm so happy you're here!

39:05.670 --> 39:06.920
You look pretty.

39:25.540 --> 39:27.040
You're gonna need
to be patient with her.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.620
This might take a little time.

39:28.620 --> 39:29.960
Yeah, I know.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.330
Can I...

40:02.960 --> 40:04.290
Stand up.

40:05.880 --> 40:08.040
We found them both, alive.

40:08.710 --> 40:11.040
Too bad you took that deal off the table.

40:11.040 --> 40:14.540
You'd be well on your way
to club fed right about now.

40:14.540 --> 40:16.290
Yeah, but don't you worry.

40:16.290 --> 40:18.620
You're gonna make a lot of friends.

40:18.620 --> 40:21.420
They're gonna love you out in the yard.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.380
"Revenge is an act of passion,

41:24.380 --> 41:26.420
"vengeance of justice."

41:27.040 --> 41:28.620
Samuel Johnson.
