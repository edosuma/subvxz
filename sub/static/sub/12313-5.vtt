WEBVTT

00:01.901 --> 00:03.669
Hank, I want to apply to medical school.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.014
Us guys can have such fragile egos.

00:06.039 --> 00:07.341
About IVF?

00:07.374 --> 00:09.477
Just one more viable
way of making a baby.

00:09.509 --> 00:10.945
Why didn't you say something?

00:10.977 --> 00:12.179
Because you're the one

00:12.211 --> 00:13.379
who's going to have
to take all the drugs

00:13.413 --> 00:14.547
and have the procedures.

00:14.580 --> 00:16.050
Your father blames himself

00:16.148 --> 00:18.484
for all of your relationship problems.

00:18.518 --> 00:20.253
- What do you mean?
- He's afraid

00:20.285 --> 00:22.621
you've become more like him
than he ever wanted you to be,

00:22.654 --> 00:25.658
and he thinks that's why you
can't seem to settle down.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:39.004 --> 00:40.440
No, thank you very much.

00:40.473 --> 00:41.942
Absolutely, yeah.

00:41.974 --> 00:45.078
No, I'll call again next week. Yep. Bye.

00:45.111 --> 00:46.879
Damn it!

00:46.913 --> 00:48.181
- Hello.
- Hi.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.449
Thank you for joining me.

00:49.481 --> 00:50.583
Thanks for calling me.

00:50.617 --> 00:52.919
- Shall we?
- Yes.

00:52.952 --> 00:55.422
Raj says he's too tired

00:55.455 --> 00:57.623
to go walking with me this morning.

00:57.657 --> 01:00.293
I don't know. I think
he's up to something.

01:00.325 --> 01:02.161
Ha ha. What would Raj be up to?

01:02.194 --> 01:03.696
Would you want to spend your morning

01:03.729 --> 01:05.598
with three crying toddlers?

01:05.631 --> 01:06.599
- Uh...
- Exactly.

01:06.633 --> 01:09.301
- He's up to something.
- Right.

01:09.334 --> 01:12.172
So that phone call...
is everything okay?

01:12.205 --> 01:13.873
Not really.

01:13.905 --> 01:15.208
I'm still waitlisted at Johns Hopkins.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.709
You know what?

01:16.742 --> 01:18.845
I just have to accept that I'm going to

01:18.878 --> 01:21.081
need to go to my second
choice medical school.

01:21.113 --> 01:23.315
Hey, hey, Stony Brook is
nothing to feel down about.

01:23.348 --> 01:25.217
They have a great program.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.920
You know a former teacher of
mine, my mentor, in fact?

01:27.953 --> 01:29.521
- He works there now.
- You're kidding. Who?

01:29.554 --> 01:31.357
Dr. Joseph Whitcomb.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.392
He's a pioneer in the field
of emergency medicine.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.061
The man is brilliant. Inspiring.

01:35.093 --> 01:36.328
Well, I'm intrigued.

01:36.361 --> 01:37.797
Why have you never mentioned him before?

01:37.830 --> 01:40.166
I didn't want to add any
pressure to your decision,

01:40.199 --> 01:42.135
but he could definitely
dispel some of your doubts.

01:42.167 --> 01:43.402
So if it would be helpful,

01:43.435 --> 01:44.670
I could arrange for you two to meet.

01:44.703 --> 01:46.473
Yeah.

01:46.506 --> 01:48.275
I'd love to meet your mentor.

01:48.307 --> 01:50.209
Done and done.

01:57.316 --> 01:58.851
Hey.

01:58.884 --> 02:02.988
Aw, didn't sleep again?

02:03.021 --> 02:05.457
No, but it worked out.

02:05.491 --> 02:08.395
I spent the night researching
everything early Americana

02:08.426 --> 02:10.863
for my meeting with Ms.
Jeffries later today.

02:10.896 --> 02:12.666
Oh, is she the, uh, the hoarder?

02:12.699 --> 02:14.701
When clients are as wealthy as Ms.
Jeffries,

02:14.733 --> 02:16.035
we call them "collectors."

02:16.069 --> 02:17.536
Sorry.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.471
But yes, she has a lot of things,

02:19.505 --> 02:21.341
and she's finally ready to sell.

02:21.374 --> 02:23.576
And we want her selling
with Berger & Lawson.

02:27.012 --> 02:29.581
I just hope I have enough
energy to impress.

02:29.614 --> 02:33.420
These ovarian stimulation meds
are wreaking serious havoc.

02:33.452 --> 02:34.854
Are you still nauseous?

02:34.886 --> 02:37.556
And tired and bloated.

02:37.589 --> 02:41.126
It's like being pregnant without
actually being pregnant.

02:41.159 --> 02:44.196
Well, I know how hard
it's been, but, uh...

02:44.230 --> 02:47.467
hey, at least when your
follicles hit 16 millimeters...

02:47.499 --> 02:49.535
- 18 millimeters.
- Isn't that what I said?

02:49.569 --> 02:52.304
No, you said 16. I need to get to 18.

02:52.338 --> 02:54.407
That's when I can get the trigger shot.

02:54.439 --> 02:55.741
Right. The trigger shot, of course.

02:55.774 --> 02:57.076
How could I have forgotten
the trigger shot?

02:57.110 --> 02:58.345
It's all about the trigger shot.

02:58.378 --> 02:59.578
Yeah.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.315
Well, maybe today's the day.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.050
I'll know after the ultrasound.

03:04.082 --> 03:06.652
- We should call it T day.
- Hmm.

03:06.685 --> 03:08.120
Just don't tell Thanksgiving.

03:08.153 --> 03:09.655
Ha ha ha. Yeah.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.925
Exactly. Don't, uh...

don't tell Thanks...

I can't remember.

03:36.815 --> 03:37.884
I believe he crawled up the spout again.

03:37.916 --> 03:39.184

03:47.927 --> 03:49.963
Raj said he wanted clips
of Divya's friends

03:49.995 --> 03:52.498
entertaining the baby,
as they have with Sashi,

03:52.532 --> 03:54.600
because the new baby will
be growing up in Baltimore.

03:54.634 --> 03:56.001
Yeah, or Stony Brook.

03:58.004 --> 04:00.273
I just... I hate thinking
about her leaving.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.810
I understand, but I'm on a deadline.

04:04.844 --> 04:07.680
Raj wanted this ready for the
surprise shower tomorrow.

04:07.713 --> 04:09.883
And why did Raj ask you to do this?

04:09.915 --> 04:11.517
I was president of the audio/visual club

04:11.551 --> 04:12.886
- in high school.
- Oh.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.255
- Ready now?
- Yes. Absolutely.

04:15.287 --> 04:17.156
Um... sorry about all the interruptions.

04:17.190 --> 04:19.426

Cut. Actually, we're
filming a segment here.

04:46.185 --> 04:47.620
That little pissant!
Think of how much work

04:47.652 --> 04:49.721
I put in that photo shoot.
I was so ready.

04:49.755 --> 04:51.190
Look at me. Don't I look ready?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.926
- You look agitated.
- Well, wouldn't you be?

04:52.959 --> 04:54.327
I have no idea what we're talking about.

04:54.359 --> 04:57.095
The shoot, Hank. I'm talking...
I'm trying to...

04:57.128 --> 04:58.831
- Deep breaths.
- I'm telling you.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.233
I... all right, I got to sit down.

05:00.265 --> 05:01.433
Yeah, please. Have a seat.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.101
Your stress level is concerning me.

05:03.135 --> 05:04.404
I got out of there pretty fast.

05:04.436 --> 05:05.604
I had to pack a bag, right?

05:05.637 --> 05:06.772
I had to make it look believable.

05:06.806 --> 05:07.974
How dare that kid!

05:08.007 --> 05:09.175
Hey, are you having any chest pains?

05:09.207 --> 05:11.243
Yeah. I'm actually feeling
a little bit winded.

05:11.277 --> 05:12.745
You're also tachycardic and sweaty.

05:12.777 --> 05:13.946
Hank, we should work him up

05:13.979 --> 05:14.947
for a possible myocardial infarction.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.616
- Mm-hmm.
- What the hell is that?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.752
A heart attack.

05:20.452 --> 05:23.423
- sync and corrections by Caio -
- www.addic7ed.com -

05:30.954 --> 05:32.774
If that kiss-ass ingrate
gave me a heart attack...

05:32.915 --> 05:35.249
You were most likely in
supraventricular tachycardia,

05:35.274 --> 05:36.876
but the carotid vagal maneuver

05:36.910 --> 05:38.538
has got you back in normal sinus rhythm.

05:38.564 --> 05:41.662
The EKG might give us a fuller
picture of what is wrong.

05:41.810 --> 05:44.213
It's probably just a panic attack.

05:44.245 --> 05:47.048
I'm still not clear on
what got you so worked up.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.749
You... you walked out of a photo shoot?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.919
No. Not just any photo shoot.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.386
I was gonna be in "Sports Illustrated."

05:52.420 --> 05:54.222
With other agents?

05:54.254 --> 05:55.435
Not just any agents.

05:55.576 --> 05:58.279
Superstar agents with their
superstar athlete clients.

05:58.312 --> 06:00.629
I set the whole thing up.
It's called "Naked Ambition."

06:00.654 --> 06:02.657
But it's tasteful naked. It's not porn.

06:02.690 --> 06:04.560
- Oh, okay.
- So I get to the shoot,

06:04.593 --> 06:07.563
and I find out I'm standing next
to Rick "The Prick" Peterson.

06:07.596 --> 06:10.132
He's this junior agent in
the same agency as me.

06:10.165 --> 06:12.000
Turns out he's stolen one
of my prospective clients.

06:12.033 --> 06:13.769
Total douche move.

06:13.802 --> 06:15.003
How do you know he stole your client?

06:15.036 --> 06:16.905
Well, it's what I would have done.

06:16.937 --> 06:18.039
It's what I did do.

06:18.072 --> 06:19.707
But the guy was old.
He was off his game.

06:19.740 --> 06:22.377
It wasn't like I took
down a lion in his prime.

06:22.409 --> 06:23.711
About that...

06:23.745 --> 06:26.882
Looks like your heart
isn't quite in its prime.

06:26.915 --> 06:29.384
There are some nonspecific ST-T changes.

06:29.416 --> 06:32.887
Q waves. Left atrial and left
ventricular hypertrophy.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.423
Something unnatural

06:34.456 --> 06:36.358
is causing the chambers
of your heart to dilate.

06:36.391 --> 06:38.160
I will schedule an echocardiogram.

06:38.192 --> 06:39.562
Good. Thank you.

06:44.932 --> 06:47.368
So I'm the wounded antelope
instead of the lion?

06:49.370 --> 06:50.938
No, no, no. No. No.

06:50.971 --> 06:52.240
- That cannot happen.
- Listen to me.

06:52.274 --> 06:53.875
- No, that...
- Listen to me.

06:53.908 --> 06:54.942
If I'm going to help you, I
need to know what's wrong,

06:54.976 --> 06:56.345
and the only way that's going to happen

06:56.377 --> 06:57.745
is if you get a more thorough workup.

06:57.779 --> 06:58.880
I'm supposed to be on my way to Miami

06:58.913 --> 07:00.414
to care for my sick dad.

07:00.447 --> 07:02.483
It's the only way I could put
the kibosh on the photo shoot.

07:02.517 --> 07:04.086
Your father died when
we were in college.

07:04.118 --> 07:05.219
I know... isn't it great

07:05.252 --> 07:06.555
he can finally do something nice for me?

07:06.587 --> 07:08.055
- Okay.
- Look. I can't risk anybody

07:08.089 --> 07:10.125
from my agency finding out that
I'm still in the Hamptons,

07:10.158 --> 07:11.560
especially Peterson.

07:11.593 --> 07:14.763
I got to figure out a way to
get that Gen Y triathlon butt

07:14.795 --> 07:16.430
kicked off of my photo shoot.

07:16.464 --> 07:20.002
You'll have plenty of time
to do that in the cath lab.

07:20.034 --> 07:21.736
Look, I'm sure you're scared.

07:21.769 --> 07:23.771
- I'm not scared.
- Okay. Okay.

07:25.574 --> 07:27.042
I'm terrified.

07:32.514 --> 07:34.983
Hey, what...

07:35.016 --> 07:36.084
Did I miss our appointment?

07:36.117 --> 07:37.853
I told you last night

07:37.885 --> 07:40.488
I had to move it because of that
appraisal with the hoarder.

07:40.521 --> 07:41.923
I mean "collector."

07:41.957 --> 07:44.459
Oh, I'm so sorry. I forgot.

07:44.492 --> 07:46.395
How'd it go?

07:46.428 --> 07:47.963
It's not T day.

07:47.995 --> 07:50.097
My follicles have stalled at 16,

07:50.130 --> 07:52.000
but the doctor said not to worry.

07:52.033 --> 07:55.470
It doesn't mean that they won't
grow to 18 by tomorrow, so...

07:55.502 --> 07:57.705
So maybe T day will be soon?

07:57.738 --> 07:59.541
Maybe.

07:59.574 --> 08:00.776
Look.

08:03.611 --> 08:05.880
I really want to be more helpful to you,

08:05.913 --> 08:07.848
so I went online to see
if there's some way

08:07.882 --> 08:09.718
to help with your "side effects,"

08:09.750 --> 08:12.387
and I found something
really interesting.

08:12.420 --> 08:14.423
Oh, that's good. Okay.

08:14.456 --> 08:17.559
When you said side effects why
did you use "air quotes"?

08:17.591 --> 08:18.859
- Oh, did I do that?
- Yeah. It was so weird.

08:18.892 --> 08:20.694
I didn't even know. I know...
well, I did that

08:20.728 --> 08:25.666
because it turns out a lot of
your symptoms are psychosomatic.

08:25.699 --> 08:27.301
That means you can stop having them.

08:27.334 --> 08:29.604
Oh!

08:29.637 --> 08:32.807
- Isn't that great?
- That's so good to know.

08:32.840 --> 08:34.642
- So I can just stop being tired.
- Yeah.

08:34.674 --> 08:35.710
- And bloated.
- Yeah.

08:35.743 --> 08:38.145
- And nauseous.
- Uh, yeah.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.948
And this runny nose isn't real.

08:39.980 --> 08:42.383
No, no, no. I'm not saying
your side effects aren't real,

08:42.416 --> 08:44.018
babe, at all. They're real.

08:44.051 --> 08:46.654
It's just your mind
that's creating them,

08:46.688 --> 08:47.923
not your hormones.

08:47.955 --> 08:49.858
So I can help you,

08:49.891 --> 08:52.627
and together we can stop them.

08:52.661 --> 08:54.595
- Oh, we can stop them.
- Yeah.

08:54.628 --> 08:55.930
Yeah.

08:55.964 --> 08:58.566
Can "we" stop the rash
on my injection site

08:58.599 --> 09:01.869
and the river of sweat that
is dripping down my back,

09:01.902 --> 09:03.471
or is this just not real either?

09:03.504 --> 09:05.940
- Shh. Paige, all I'm...
- Did you just shush me?

09:05.973 --> 09:08.175
Look, I work here, so...

09:08.209 --> 09:09.978
Oh, my God. You did just shush me.

09:10.011 --> 09:11.512
- I...
- Well, guess what.

09:11.545 --> 09:12.781
I don't need to interrupt your work,

09:12.814 --> 09:16.151
because I work too.

09:16.184 --> 09:18.721
Or is that just in my head?

09:20.888 --> 09:22.923
Radiation isn't a plaything,

09:22.956 --> 09:27.028
but a half-life is better
than no life at all.

09:27.061 --> 09:31.565
Hello... Divya's baby.

09:31.598 --> 09:34.869
This is Madam Curie, your big
sister's favorite puppet.

09:34.902 --> 09:37.071
Course, I know
you're too young currently

09:37.104 --> 09:39.640
to understand about radiation,

09:39.674 --> 09:43.478
but Madam Curie was a
very important scientist.

09:43.511 --> 09:46.815
She was also a mom.

09:46.848 --> 09:49.351
Did you know that I...

09:49.383 --> 09:51.385
I knew your mom before she
went to medical school

09:51.419 --> 09:54.990
and became a doctor?

09:55.022 --> 09:57.658
She was...

09:57.691 --> 10:00.628
she was a very, very special person,

10:00.661 --> 10:03.964
and I... I know that if...

10:03.997 --> 10:06.033
if you can listen to her,

10:06.066 --> 10:10.104
you will grow up to be
a very fine person.

10:15.844 --> 10:19.480
Uh, c-cut all that.

10:19.513 --> 10:21.115
Take two.

10:33.762 --> 10:36.497
Hello? Dr. Whitcomb?

10:36.531 --> 10:38.300
Uh...

10:38.333 --> 10:39.901
Oh, gosh. Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:39.934 --> 10:41.236
I didn't mean to wake you.

10:41.268 --> 10:43.304
I-I wasn't sleeping. I was reading.

10:43.338 --> 10:44.606
Call me Joe.

10:44.638 --> 10:47.642
Okay, sure. I'll, uh, I'll call you Joe.

10:47.675 --> 10:49.611
Did I say something funny?

10:49.643 --> 10:53.147
No. No, not at all. I...

10:53.180 --> 10:56.317
You just remind me of
another doctor that I know.

10:56.350 --> 10:57.818
Who are you? What do you want?

10:57.852 --> 11:01.356
Sorry. I'm Divya Katdare.
I have an appointment.

11:01.388 --> 11:04.925
Oh. Oh, then come in and
close the door behind you.

11:04.959 --> 11:06.929
You're letting all the cold air out.

11:13.501 --> 11:16.938
Yeah, it's, uh... it's
rather cool in here.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.407
Women are more sensitive
to cold than men.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.108
So what can I do for you?

11:21.142 --> 11:22.310
And please make it quick.

11:22.343 --> 11:23.878
I don't want to be late
for my grand rounds.

11:23.911 --> 11:25.814
Of course. I'd like to talk
about the medical program

11:25.847 --> 11:27.416
at Stony Brook.

11:27.449 --> 11:28.849
I've been admitted for
the fall semester,

11:28.882 --> 11:30.685
though I haven't formally accepted.

11:30.718 --> 11:33.188
You're entering medical school?

11:33.220 --> 11:36.924
Yes. I'm due five weeks
before the semester begins,

11:36.958 --> 11:38.760
which I know will be a challenge,

11:38.792 --> 11:41.095
but I've been working as a
PA for several years now.

11:41.128 --> 11:43.731
Another eager beaver.

11:43.765 --> 11:45.699
Well, I'm afraid you're
gonna have to wait

11:45.733 --> 11:47.536
until second semester to shadow me.

11:47.569 --> 11:49.337
I do not accept first semester students.

11:49.369 --> 11:51.839
Oh, no. I'm here because
of a mutual friend

11:51.872 --> 11:53.642
who recommended that we meet.

11:53.675 --> 11:57.478
- Oh, who?
- Hank Lawson.

11:59.010 --> 12:02.684
He, uh, he worked under
you in Brooklyn I think.

12:02.717 --> 12:05.821
Yes, I remember him.

12:05.853 --> 12:07.888
I was under the impression that, uh,

12:07.921 --> 12:11.392
Dr. Lawson had quit practicing
medicine some time ago.

12:11.425 --> 12:12.526
No, not at all.

12:12.560 --> 12:14.329
He's a concierge doctor in the Hamptons.

12:14.362 --> 12:17.466
Like I said. Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:33.565 --> 12:34.588
No, my flight was delayed,

12:34.651 --> 12:36.019
but luckily my dad's still breathing.

12:36.378 --> 12:37.614
Yeah, I'm in the hospital right now.

12:37.647 --> 12:39.248
I'm waiting for his
echocardiogram results.

12:39.282 --> 12:41.551
- Make yourself at home.
- Oh, hey.

12:41.585 --> 12:45.122
My dad's doctor's here,
so I got to bounce.

12:45.154 --> 12:48.057
Thanks. I will. Jerk.

12:48.090 --> 12:51.128
- Him. Not you.
- Oh, what a relief.

12:51.346 --> 12:53.248
Ken, I got your test results.

12:53.280 --> 12:54.882
Man, I never really appreciated

12:54.915 --> 12:56.417
what a cozy little setup you got here.

12:56.451 --> 12:57.819
You got the spa and the pool table.

12:57.852 --> 13:00.488
You got some cool décor. You
got some taste, Lawson.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.947
Did you pick this stuff out yourself,

13:02.026 --> 13:03.896
or did you schtup some
internal decorator?

13:03.929 --> 13:06.232
Neither. It all came with the place.

13:06.265 --> 13:08.601
What I own could fit in a suitcase.

13:08.633 --> 13:10.536
Ken, your echo results...

13:10.569 --> 13:13.033
My heart's messed up. I know. I know.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.769
How'd you know?

13:14.794 --> 13:16.396
You called me "Ken" twice.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.131
You never call me by my first name,

13:18.164 --> 13:20.000
so I know it must be bad.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.302
Am I right?

13:22.334 --> 13:23.870
Um...

13:26.173 --> 13:28.208
The test confirmed cardiomyopathy.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.610
Heart failure.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.110
Something is damaging your heart,

13:31.144 --> 13:32.379
and we need to figure out what.

13:32.411 --> 13:33.446
Have you been using?

13:33.480 --> 13:35.716
Using... What, using drugs?

13:35.749 --> 13:38.085
I mean, I feel the temptation
sometimes, but no.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.153
I can't bounce back the
next day the way I used to.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.556
- Right.
- What else could be the cause?

13:42.588 --> 13:44.458
Well, there's a chance
it could be diabetes

13:44.491 --> 13:46.894
or something genetic, even viral.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.829
The lab work will help narrow it down.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.065
I've also made an appointment
for you to see a cardiologist.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.171
Hank, when did we get old?

13:57.203 --> 14:01.007
We're not old. Just old... er.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.209
Yeah, but I'm not ready for
achy joints and hearing loss

14:03.242 --> 14:04.578
and my hair falling out

14:04.611 --> 14:06.013
and popping up in places it shouldn't.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.914
You're 40-something, not 80.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.183
And yet I'm holding the
card of a cardiologist.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.818
Yeah.

14:11.852 --> 14:14.321
It's so strange... I always
thought I'd live a long life.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.256
Well, no one is saying you won't.

14:16.289 --> 14:18.292
Can you tell me for sure that I will?

14:18.324 --> 14:20.259
Ken... I mean, Keller...

14:20.293 --> 14:22.196
I think I need to be alone.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.930
Okay.

14:23.963 --> 14:25.098
Okay.

14:27.501 --> 14:30.136
- Do you mind?
- Oh, you... yeah. Okay.

14:34.607 --> 14:36.008
Hey.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.343
Hey.

14:37.376 --> 14:39.313
I thought you guys were
still at the hospital.

14:39.346 --> 14:40.447
Well, we just got back.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.583
Okay. Was everything okay?

14:42.616 --> 14:44.784
Yeah. Hoping it will be.

14:44.818 --> 14:46.486
So how was Whitcomb?

14:46.520 --> 14:48.121
Busy.

14:48.155 --> 14:50.323
He didn't seem to have much time for me.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.291
What? He didn't give you a warm welcome?

14:52.324 --> 14:54.828
Not from him or his office.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.797
It was kind of like a meat locker.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.865
I'm surprised it didn't go well.

14:58.899 --> 15:00.534
Honestly, it couldn't have gone worse.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.034
He was hostile.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.105
The only excuse I could think
of is maybe he's a day drinker.

15:05.137 --> 15:06.439
He sure was chugging something,

15:06.472 --> 15:07.875
and it didn't seem to quench his thirst.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.010
Wait a second... are you
sure you saw the right guy?

15:10.043 --> 15:12.078
Well, yeah. Mm...

15:13.413 --> 15:16.216
This is the man that I met.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.252
I Googled him before the meeting.

15:18.284 --> 15:19.886
Yeah. That's him, but...

15:19.919 --> 15:21.854
wow, he's aged.

15:21.887 --> 15:24.257
Well, whatever his reasons,
he didn't seem to like me.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.491
And just so you know,

15:25.525 --> 15:27.727
he is no big fan of yours either.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.596
- Really?
- The nicest thing

15:29.629 --> 15:32.066
I could say about him
is he's a total grouch.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.169
I think I know why.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.285
Everything okay, honey?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.721
I had a fight with Evan.

15:54.754 --> 15:57.157
He basically called me
crazy, which is crazy.

15:57.189 --> 15:59.358
Men can be such jerks.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.127
Oh, no offense.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.228
Some taken.

16:02.261 --> 16:04.363
Listen, I know how hard you've worked

16:04.396 --> 16:06.032
trying to pry Ms. Jeffries'
grip off her valuables,

16:06.065 --> 16:07.466
and I am fully prepared...

16:07.500 --> 16:08.735
Good, because she's cash poor,

16:08.767 --> 16:10.736
and if I am going to
help the dear goose,

16:10.770 --> 16:13.607
it's now or never. I
can't risk any missteps.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.174
Have I ever made a misstep?

16:15.208 --> 16:18.779
No, but you've also never
shown up wearing earrings

16:18.812 --> 16:20.714
that don't complement your jaw line.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.815
Your top button is pulling,
which the Paige I know

16:22.848 --> 16:24.784
never tolerate, and...

16:24.818 --> 16:28.922
dare I say I see moisture
on your upper lip,

16:28.954 --> 16:30.890
which can only be a warning

16:30.924 --> 16:33.492
of sweat rings about to
bloom at any moment.

16:33.525 --> 16:35.496
- No offense.
- Some taken.

16:36.862 --> 16:41.101
Wow, my stimulation meds are...
really stimulating.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.769
You sure you want to do this?

16:42.802 --> 16:44.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.173
Yeah, let's go.

16:51.544 --> 16:52.913
Make yourself comfortable.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.414
Ms. Jeffries will be down shortly.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.049
Thank you.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.059
This place is a gold mine.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.198
I spy with my little eye

17:12.231 --> 17:15.201
an authentic Paul Revere tea service.

17:15.234 --> 17:19.406
That teapot alone is worth a fortune.

17:19.438 --> 17:22.342
- Do you see the mark?
- Oh.

17:26.512 --> 17:30.183
Look at that adorable bear.

17:30.216 --> 17:34.388
I think even Ms. Jeffries can
relegate that to the dustbin.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.055
Look at the craftsmanship,

17:36.089 --> 17:37.958
and he's been loved to death,

17:37.990 --> 17:40.026
and his little ear's all chewed.

17:40.060 --> 17:42.296
And someone loved you, didn't they?

17:53.006 --> 17:54.941
I'll show myself out.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.125
Dr. Whitcomb.

18:13.159 --> 18:15.128
Ha ha ha.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.964
Two Hamptonites in one day.

18:16.996 --> 18:19.198
What have I done to deserve this honor?

18:19.231 --> 18:21.534
Joe, I just found out
that Lenore passed away.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.903
I'm so sorry.

18:23.937 --> 18:26.173
- She was a fine woman.
- She was.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.741
I liked her very much.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.443
Yeah, I remember.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.947
It's been a few years,
but you look the same.

18:33.979 --> 18:36.415
And you've lost a few pounds,

18:36.448 --> 18:37.683
but no surprise.

18:37.717 --> 18:40.020
I remember how Lenore liked to feed you.

18:40.053 --> 18:41.755
Well, I had a few pounds to spare.

18:41.787 --> 18:44.123
Excuse me, I, uh, have some, uh,

18:44.157 --> 18:45.859
patients to take care of.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.129
My physician assistant
got the impression

18:49.161 --> 18:51.331
that you were upset with
me, and, Joe, look,

18:51.363 --> 18:52.498
I know I've been lousy

18:52.532 --> 18:54.034
at staying in contact
over the past few years,

18:54.066 --> 18:55.768
but you gave me my start in medicine.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.971
- I owe you so much.
- You owe me nothing.

18:58.004 --> 19:00.207
Then why?

19:00.239 --> 19:02.008
Why do you seem so angry?

19:04.076 --> 19:07.948
You were the most promising
ER physician I ever trained.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.850
I-I-I favored you,
took you into my home.

19:10.883 --> 19:13.452
You said you would commit to Brooklyn.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.854
I thought, "Wow, I finally

19:14.888 --> 19:19.292
found somebody I could
really trust to replace me."

19:19.324 --> 19:20.459
Hah!

19:20.493 --> 19:22.429
Hey, hey, hey. I wanted
to stay in Brooklyn,

19:22.461 --> 19:24.131
- but they didn't want me.
- No, you didn't.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.032
If you wanted to stay, you
would have put up a fight,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.034
like I did for you.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.035
- And I appreciated it.
- Oh, sure.

19:29.069 --> 19:33.807
You waltzed off to the Hamptons
to do boobs and Botox.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.842
How much weight have you lost, Joe?

19:35.874 --> 19:37.643
- What are you talking about?
- Weight loss.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.880
You're drinking water like a
man with serious dehydration.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.781
I am old. I am grieving,

19:41.814 --> 19:43.917
and I don't need you to diagnose me!

19:43.949 --> 19:45.818
Has anyone diagnosed you?

19:45.852 --> 19:47.521
Divya mentioned your office is freezing.

19:47.554 --> 19:49.523
- You also keep rubbing your eyes.
- For God's sakes.

19:49.555 --> 19:50.790
I got work to do!

19:51.858 --> 19:53.260
Real work.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.601
Joe.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.670
Are you okay?

20:04.704 --> 20:05.806
Joe!

20:07.969 --> 20:10.205
Joe, are you okay?

20:11.454 --> 20:13.490
Hey, I need a gurney and a crash cart.

20:13.523 --> 20:15.792
- Tell them it's for Dr. Whitcomb.
- Okay.

20:15.824 --> 20:17.459
Okay... don't move.

20:17.493 --> 20:19.629
Don't move... I want to make sure
you didn't break anything, okay?

20:19.661 --> 20:20.997
Where do you hurt?

20:21.029 --> 20:23.098
No, I-I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:23.131 --> 20:24.366
Okay.

20:24.400 --> 20:25.834
Can you move your arms and legs?

20:25.868 --> 20:27.170
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.

20:27.202 --> 20:29.171
Okay, good. Nexus negative.

20:29.205 --> 20:30.070
All right.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.567
But you're definitely running a fever.

20:41.208 --> 20:42.943
- Your thyroid.
- What about it?

20:42.976 --> 20:44.679
It's enlarged.

20:52.286 --> 20:53.587
Hypertensive.

20:57.358 --> 20:59.860
- Irregularly irregular.
- Oh, boy.

20:59.893 --> 21:02.029
Joe, are you experiencing
heat sensitivity?

21:02.062 --> 21:03.331
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.832
- Does your vision get blurry?
- Oh, does it!

21:04.866 --> 21:06.868
Combined with your dehydration...

21:06.900 --> 21:08.669
- Is it what I think it is?
- Graves disease.

21:08.703 --> 21:10.772
Not only that, I think you're in
the middle of a thyroid storm.

21:10.804 --> 21:12.974
Over here! Hurry.

21:13.006 --> 21:16.177
I'm with you, Joe. You
just hang in there, okay?

21:18.646 --> 21:19.648
Hey.

21:19.680 --> 21:20.915
- Hi.
- Wow.

21:20.948 --> 21:23.418
You can shut the door, and
please sit on the stool.

21:28.589 --> 21:30.325
Oh, this is cool.

21:30.358 --> 21:31.826
You done this before?

21:31.859 --> 21:34.329
I've made a film at every film reunion.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.496
It allowed me to be with family,

21:35.530 --> 21:37.532
- but at a sufficient remove.
- Yeah.

21:37.564 --> 21:38.966
The only thing more stressful

21:38.999 --> 21:41.602
than being with family's
trying to start one.

21:41.636 --> 21:42.737
All right. You ready?

21:42.770 --> 21:44.973
- Commence nursery rhyme.
- Okay, great.

21:45.005 --> 21:47.341
Well, this one is a showstopper.

21:47.374 --> 21:48.642
It's my favorite of all time,

21:48.676 --> 21:50.445
but it's one you might
not have heard of.

21:50.477 --> 21:52.447
It's called "Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling."

21:53.814 --> 21:55.417
- Diddle, diddle...
- Do you have another one?

21:55.449 --> 21:57.251
That one's been used.

21:57.284 --> 21:58.786
What? Who used it?

21:58.820 --> 22:00.054
What do you mean it's been...
who... who...

22:00.088 --> 22:01.423
who would use that?

22:03.824 --> 22:05.459
<i>Hi, cute baby.</i>

22:05.493 --> 22:08.596
<i>I'm going to be reading you
"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling."</i>

22:08.629 --> 22:10.432
<i>"Diddle, diddle, dumpling.</i>

22:10.465 --> 22:14.269
<i>"My son John went to bed
with his pants still on.</i>

22:14.302 --> 22:16.771
<i>"One shoe off, and one shoe on.</i>

22:16.803 --> 22:18.773
<i>Diddle, diddle"...</i>

22:18.805 --> 22:20.507
<i>I think I might have screwed that up.</i>

22:20.541 --> 22:22.944
She knows it's my favorite.
Why would she do that?

22:22.976 --> 22:24.745
<i>Anyway, all I know for sure</i>

22:24.779 --> 22:28.450
<i>is that Evan's mom used to
read this to him every night</i>

22:28.483 --> 22:30.485
<i>before he went to bed.</i>

22:30.517 --> 22:32.252
<i>I'm going to try not to cry.</i>

22:32.285 --> 22:34.121
She stopped by yesterday, so...

22:34.155 --> 22:36.925
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Hold on.

22:36.957 --> 22:39.259
<i>He still loves it,</i>

22:39.293 --> 22:42.831
<i>and, uh, if there's any mom out there</i>

22:42.863 --> 22:47.600
<i>who can raise a child to
be as funny and smart</i>

22:47.635 --> 22:51.072
<i>and kind as my sweet husband,</i>

22:51.104 --> 22:53.574
<i>it's you, Divya.</i>

22:53.608 --> 22:56.177
<i>Oh, I think I got off topic again.</i>

22:57.477 --> 22:58.647
Evan?

23:03.885 --> 23:05.454
I'm never going to finish this.

23:10.491 --> 23:13.628
You were right. Graves disease.

23:13.660 --> 23:16.497
All right. Take me
through the treatments.

23:16.531 --> 23:20.135
Beta blockers and PTU
to control my symptoms

23:20.168 --> 23:22.669
and stop thyroid hormone synthesis.

23:22.703 --> 23:26.107
And after a few days,
radioactive iodine.

23:26.139 --> 23:29.643
- How'd I do?
- You show great promise.

23:29.677 --> 23:32.647
I'll be in touch with the staff
to monitor your progress

23:32.679 --> 23:34.783
and will stay on top of
research for a cure.

23:34.815 --> 23:37.351
Hey, Hank, you saved my life.

23:37.385 --> 23:38.520
You've done enough.

23:38.552 --> 23:40.588
I want to keep looking.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.224
A great doctor once told me,

23:43.256 --> 23:47.495
"Never assume treatments
will not get better."

23:47.527 --> 23:51.298
You know, I now remember
why you were my favorite.

23:51.331 --> 23:53.635
The other students were restless.

23:53.668 --> 23:55.703
They... they couldn't commit.

23:55.735 --> 23:58.706
All they wanted to do was leave...

23:58.738 --> 24:01.642
and you were ready to
make Brooklyn home.

24:01.676 --> 24:04.946
You once told me that your
big dream was to settle down

24:04.978 --> 24:08.482
and dedicate your life to my ER.

24:08.515 --> 24:14.755
26 years old, and you couldn't
wait to set down roots.

24:14.789 --> 24:17.358
Those bastards never
should have fired you.

24:17.390 --> 24:19.860
Believe it or not, those
bastards did me a favor.

24:19.893 --> 24:22.197
Losing that job changed
everything for me.

24:22.229 --> 24:24.765
In a good way.

24:24.799 --> 24:26.968
I hope you can forgive me.

24:27.001 --> 24:29.771
I hope you can forgive me.

24:29.803 --> 24:34.274
I really misjudged the kind
of doctor you've become.

24:34.308 --> 24:37.579
And thank heaven you're still
a hell of a diagnostician.

24:37.611 --> 24:40.948
I learned it all from you.

24:40.982 --> 24:44.752
Listen, one more thing, and
please don't break my heart.

24:44.784 --> 24:49.123
The Saab you bought from me.
Is it still running?

24:49.157 --> 24:51.259
200,000 miles and counting.

24:51.292 --> 24:53.360
Like me!

25:02.969 --> 25:05.273
- Need a little help over there?
- I got it. I got it.

25:05.305 --> 25:06.573
Yeah, okay.

25:06.607 --> 25:09.244
Anybody heard from Raj?
What's their ETA?

25:11.078 --> 25:12.680
- Good morning.
- Whatever.

25:15.049 --> 25:18.786
Are you wearing my bathrobe
and hoodie and sweats?

25:22.223 --> 25:24.759
No, please. Just keep 'em.

25:26.627 --> 25:27.995
Hello?

25:29.563 --> 25:30.764
- Is he okay?
- Yeah.

25:30.797 --> 25:32.633
I'll go check on him.

25:35.770 --> 25:36.937
- What can I do to help you?
- Oh, no.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.372
I'm good. I just finished here.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.807
All right.

25:39.840 --> 25:41.376
What else needs to be done?

25:41.408 --> 25:42.744
You know, I can handle it.

25:42.776 --> 25:43.977
I know, but I want to help you.

25:44.011 --> 25:46.380
Let me do this. Let me
just do this, okay?

25:49.249 --> 25:50.450
I like doing cupcakes. Say when.

25:50.484 --> 25:51.753
Oh, that's not really great.

25:51.785 --> 25:53.220
It's okay. I'm going to fix it.

25:53.254 --> 25:55.423
Look, just going to consolidate
some of this stuff...

25:55.456 --> 25:58.860
- Uh...
- And, uh...

25:58.892 --> 26:00.093
Maybe I should help with something else.

26:00.127 --> 26:01.296
Yeah.

26:01.329 --> 26:03.364
- I got it. I got it!

26:03.397 --> 26:05.567
'Cause I want to be helpful.
Oh, it's not a call.

26:05.600 --> 26:06.833
Yes. No, it's time for a shot.

26:06.867 --> 26:08.302
I've got this, really.

26:08.335 --> 26:10.103
- That's Raj. They're coming.
- It's happening.

26:10.137 --> 26:11.406
- They're coming.
- It's happening!

26:11.438 --> 26:13.807
- It's happening!
- Hank? Hank?

26:13.841 --> 26:15.877
Yeah. Oh.

26:15.909 --> 26:18.079
Come on, Keller. Come on.

26:18.111 --> 26:19.514
Evan, come on.

26:19.546 --> 26:20.948
Keller, finish the call, and hide.

26:20.982 --> 26:22.083
We're hiding!

26:22.116 --> 26:24.319
No, Peterson. I'm still in Florida.

26:25.620 --> 26:26.787
Oh, I'm sorry.

26:26.821 --> 26:28.356
Do the words heart
failure, heart disease

26:28.389 --> 26:30.291
and cardio-something-or-other
mean nothing to you?

26:30.323 --> 26:32.759
My father could be dying,
you understand, facing

26:32.793 --> 26:34.228
an eternity of nothingness
- Get off the phone!

26:34.262 --> 26:36.264
Shh, shh, shh! And you're
worried about some photo shoot?

26:36.296 --> 26:40.168
Show some class, you schmuck.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.835
Damn, that felt good.

26:43.504 --> 26:44.973
It was a work call.

26:47.975 --> 26:49.977
Keller?

26:50.011 --> 26:52.312
What just happened?

26:52.345 --> 26:53.513
- No pulse.
- I'll get the paddles.

26:53.546 --> 26:54.982
- Good.
- Uh, yeah, hi.

26:55.015 --> 26:56.149
We need an ambulance right away.

26:56.183 --> 26:58.286
550 Meadowvale Lane.

26:58.319 --> 27:00.655
Yeah, Shadow Pond. That's right.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.323
Come on, Ken.

27:15.669 --> 27:17.504
Surpri...

27:17.537 --> 27:19.339
Clear!

27:19.372 --> 27:22.242
- What's wrong?
- Keller's in V fib. Surprise.

27:22.275 --> 27:23.710
Okay. I'll start an IV and push epi.

27:23.744 --> 27:26.179
We'll need amiodarone too.

27:26.213 --> 27:27.982
All right. Paramedics are on the way.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.583
Clear!

27:29.617 --> 27:32.186
Come on, Keller.

27:32.218 --> 27:33.987
Boy, that's a flatline.

27:34.021 --> 27:36.858
Keller's flatlining right now?

27:41.677 --> 27:43.713
Come on, Ken. Come on.

27:46.107 --> 27:47.241
He's going to make it, right?

27:47.273 --> 27:49.042
Ken Keller is not going to die.

27:49.076 --> 27:51.379
Not on my floor, and not in my sweats.

27:54.856 --> 27:56.683
Okay. He's no longer in asystole.

27:56.716 --> 27:59.052
He's back in V fib.
Let's shock him again.

27:59.086 --> 28:00.387
Everyone, stand back.

28:05.192 --> 28:06.694
Damn it. Damn it. Stay with us.

28:06.726 --> 28:07.861
I'll intubate.

28:10.097 --> 28:12.267
Alive! I'm alive.

28:15.168 --> 28:16.470
His pulse is pounding.

28:20.107 --> 28:24.178
Keller, what the hell have you
been injecting yourself with?

28:27.848 --> 28:29.117
Thanks.

28:34.355 --> 28:35.757
Hi.

28:35.790 --> 28:37.791
If you've come to see
Paige, she's not here.

28:37.824 --> 28:41.061
Oh, no. I'm actually here to see you.

28:41.095 --> 28:43.098
You have something on your shirt.

28:45.066 --> 28:46.534
It's frosting.

28:50.236 --> 28:51.238
I need your help.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.974
I need to get a gift for Paige,

28:54.008 --> 28:56.811
and I heard her talking to her
mom about some teddy bear.

28:56.843 --> 28:59.046
I'd like to buy it.

28:59.080 --> 29:00.915
Oh.

29:02.515 --> 29:03.817
Wow. This is it?

29:03.850 --> 29:05.719
That is it. And put it down.

29:05.753 --> 29:07.054
You can't buy it.

29:07.088 --> 29:08.589
Why not?

29:08.621 --> 29:12.125
Thanks to your remarkable
wife's keen eye for valuables,

29:12.158 --> 29:15.162
I did some research, and
that dusty mohair bear

29:15.195 --> 29:16.964
is a one-of-a-kind Steiff.

29:16.996 --> 29:18.599
Price is no object.

29:18.631 --> 29:22.070
Starting bid in the high six figures.

29:31.177 --> 29:34.616
I just need to get her
something really special.

29:37.384 --> 29:39.753
She's been having a hard time lately,

29:39.787 --> 29:43.591
and I haven't been very helpful

29:43.624 --> 29:45.358
at all, really.

29:45.391 --> 29:47.961
And a gift will help you fix that?

29:47.994 --> 29:50.964
- Right.
- Wrong.

29:50.997 --> 29:52.365
It's a bribe.

29:52.398 --> 29:53.900
Well, I can't just say I'm sorry.

29:53.934 --> 29:55.203
Nor should you.

29:55.235 --> 29:58.305
Those words will only
mean "I'm not listening.

29:58.339 --> 30:00.742
"I'm not taking accountability,

30:00.774 --> 30:03.343
and whatever I did, I
will just do it again."

30:04.677 --> 30:06.813
If you truly want to apologize...

30:06.847 --> 30:07.882
I do.

30:07.915 --> 30:10.484
You need to say, "I hear you."

30:10.518 --> 30:11.953
Well, that's easy.

30:11.985 --> 30:13.820
- "I understand."
- That's easy too.

30:13.853 --> 30:17.057
And then don't do it again.

30:17.090 --> 30:19.593
That could be hard.

30:22.262 --> 30:24.564
Steroids? Really?

30:24.598 --> 30:27.401
I know. I know, Lawson.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.903
I stopped taking them a month ago.

30:28.935 --> 30:30.170
Why did you take them at all?

30:30.204 --> 30:32.173
Of course.

30:32.205 --> 30:33.906
You wanted to look good
for a photo shoot.

30:33.941 --> 30:35.143
For "Sports Illustrated."

30:35.176 --> 30:37.011
Why didn't you tell me?

30:37.043 --> 30:38.612
Because I knew you'd
get all judge-y on me.

30:38.646 --> 30:40.181
You almost got all dead-y on me.

30:40.214 --> 30:41.315
I mean, you have no idea

30:41.348 --> 30:43.151
how stressful the corporate world is...

30:43.184 --> 30:45.051
competing with kids like Peterson.

30:45.085 --> 30:46.788
They don't want to earn
their way to the top.

30:46.820 --> 30:48.321
They just want to leapfrog up there.

30:48.355 --> 30:50.558
So I did what I had to do.

30:50.590 --> 30:53.426
But, yes, I should have told you.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.696
Trust me. I'll never take them again.

30:55.728 --> 30:57.731
Well, if you want the damage to
your heart to reverse itself,

30:57.764 --> 30:58.932
that's probably a good idea.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.501
You don't have to worry.

31:00.533 --> 31:03.070
Because of you, I've seen the light.

31:03.102 --> 31:04.437
Okay. You're scaring me.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.906
You saved me to inspire me.

31:06.941 --> 31:09.443
And now I'm terrified.

31:09.475 --> 31:11.078
How could I inspire you?

31:11.110 --> 31:14.080
Well, you live like a 20-year-old.

31:14.114 --> 31:16.417
- That's ridiculous.
- Look at your life.

31:16.449 --> 31:17.751
Unlike your brother or Divya,

31:17.784 --> 31:20.253
you haven't settled in at all
since you started HankMed.

31:20.287 --> 31:22.557
You've got no possessions, no mortgage,

31:22.589 --> 31:24.192
no girlfriend, no boss.

31:24.224 --> 31:25.792
You've got nothing.

31:25.826 --> 31:26.894
That sounds awful.

31:26.926 --> 31:28.795
I used to think it was
weird and creepy too.

31:28.829 --> 31:30.697
- Oh.
- But now I realize

31:30.731 --> 31:33.233
that's what's keeping you so
healthy and looking so young.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.568
You're like this healthy young bird

31:34.601 --> 31:36.469
just flying around totally free.

31:36.503 --> 31:38.673
If I could live like you,

31:38.705 --> 31:40.273
be like you...

31:40.307 --> 31:43.211
maybe I could be happy.

31:43.243 --> 31:45.213
But first I have to be a new person.

31:45.245 --> 31:47.480
I have to be a different person.

31:47.513 --> 31:49.449
I have to make a huge change.

31:49.483 --> 31:52.753
I'm selling my houses.
Everything in 'em.

31:52.785 --> 31:53.920
And I'm moving to L.A.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.556
California? That's...

31:55.589 --> 31:56.823
that's your big change?

31:56.857 --> 31:57.959
It's the perfect place for me.

31:57.992 --> 31:59.226
Nobody gets old there.

31:59.260 --> 32:01.061
Who knows? Maybe a year from now

32:01.095 --> 32:03.564
I can be alone on the cover
of "Sports Illustrated"

32:03.597 --> 32:05.666
living in my own swanky guest house.

32:05.698 --> 32:07.601
I can't believe I'm gonna say this,

32:07.635 --> 32:10.104
but... I think I'm gonna miss you.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.638
Of course you are.

32:11.672 --> 32:12.940
Come here. Bring it in.

32:12.973 --> 32:14.508
- Well, uh...
- Hey! Bring it in.

32:14.541 --> 32:16.844
Okay. All right. Let's do it.

32:16.877 --> 32:18.178
There you go, Keller.

32:18.212 --> 32:19.247
Ooh.

32:19.280 --> 32:20.748
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

32:20.781 --> 32:22.515
Yep. This is happening.

32:22.549 --> 32:24.151
- Hmm.
- We good?

32:24.184 --> 32:26.454
No. Not yet.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.955
I think we're good.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.056
Okay.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.503
Is it true?

32:42.535 --> 32:44.705
Doctor called this afternoon.

32:44.737 --> 32:46.407
My follicles have grown to 18.

32:46.439 --> 32:48.074
So it's the end of stimulation?

32:48.108 --> 32:49.844
- It's the end of stimulation.
- It's finally T day.

32:49.877 --> 32:51.279
It's finally T day.

32:51.311 --> 32:52.580
Ha ha ha!

32:52.612 --> 32:54.248
Oh, my God.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.319
Oh, that's awesome.

32:58.351 --> 33:00.454
So I'll give myself the trigger shot,

33:00.486 --> 33:02.022
and if all goes well

33:02.055 --> 33:04.524
we could be pregnant by
the end of the month.

33:04.558 --> 33:05.693
Wow.

33:08.795 --> 33:10.364
Just like that.

33:13.099 --> 33:14.167
Okay.

33:16.503 --> 33:18.438
You should probably go now.

33:18.472 --> 33:20.141
Yeah, yeah.

33:23.510 --> 33:24.545
Wait.

33:27.147 --> 33:28.482
I'm not leaving you.

33:28.514 --> 33:32.118
Evan, it's okay. I can do this.

33:32.151 --> 33:34.087
So can I.

33:44.464 --> 33:47.667
Okay.

33:47.701 --> 33:49.603
Okay, I'm going to pinch the skin,

33:49.636 --> 33:51.539
- and you go for it.
- All right.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.206
I'll just go for it.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.009
Yeah. Okay. Ready?

33:56.443 --> 33:57.445
One.

33:57.477 --> 33:59.179
Two.

33:59.213 --> 34:00.248
Three.

34:09.554 --> 34:11.858
We did it.

34:20.728 --> 34:22.297
- Cupcake?
- Thanks. Almost ready.

34:22.330 --> 34:23.831
Oh, good.

34:23.864 --> 34:26.333
That's amazing, 'cause I
never knew it before.

34:26.368 --> 34:28.103
Oh, thanks, baby.

34:28.136 --> 34:30.438
But I have a fear of needles.

34:30.472 --> 34:32.473
Trypanophobia. I had it too.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.007
Really?

34:34.042 --> 34:36.745
Was it me, or did the
trigger shot seem huge?

34:36.777 --> 34:37.913
Oh, yeah.

34:37.946 --> 34:39.848
I don't even like talking about it.

34:39.880 --> 34:41.382
- Come on.
- Okay, okay.

34:41.415 --> 34:42.984
Maybe like 24-25.

34:43.016 --> 34:44.552
All right. Thank you.

34:44.585 --> 34:45.953
It's not just what Keller said

34:45.985 --> 34:47.856
about how I live like a 20-year-old.

34:47.888 --> 34:49.956
It's also what Whitcomb reminded me of.

34:49.989 --> 34:51.359
How I wanted to live.

34:51.391 --> 34:52.760
It sounds like you had
very specific goals

34:52.793 --> 34:54.029
when you worked in Brooklyn.

34:54.062 --> 34:57.199
Yeah, but why did I
abandon them when I left?

34:57.232 --> 35:01.036
It's like I never allowed myself
to really set roots down.

35:01.069 --> 35:02.504
Maybe because you thought your stay here

35:02.537 --> 35:03.772
was going to be temporary.

35:03.805 --> 35:05.440
Yeah, but I've been here for years.

35:05.473 --> 35:07.609
I'm still living in somebody
else's guest house.

35:07.642 --> 35:11.145
Okay. Maybe now you're ready to commit.

35:11.178 --> 35:13.080
I am.

35:13.113 --> 35:14.615
No more holding back.

35:14.649 --> 35:15.951
Yeah.

35:15.984 --> 35:18.053
Hopefully we'll both be
out of limbo very soon.

35:18.086 --> 35:21.156
Yeah. Oh, that reminds me.

35:21.189 --> 35:22.891
Dr. Whitcomb was in so much pain

35:22.923 --> 35:25.292
when you saw him, he
truly wasn't himself.

35:25.325 --> 35:27.028
He feels terrible about the
way he handled things,

35:27.062 --> 35:28.563
and he hopes you'll meet
with him again soon.

35:28.595 --> 35:30.831
Okay, so about Stony Brook...

35:30.865 --> 35:32.100
I'm ready.

35:32.133 --> 35:33.901
Everyone, please gather
around the movie screen.

35:33.935 --> 35:36.404
- Oh. Later?
- Yeah.

35:36.437 --> 35:38.106
Okay.

35:38.138 --> 35:40.541
- Shall we?
- Yes.

35:42.910 --> 35:47.014
Divya, I asked Jeremiah,
and he very kindly agreed

35:47.048 --> 35:49.984
to make a special movie for the shower.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.952
Yes. There were some
technical challenges

35:51.986 --> 35:54.289
which I won't belabor,

35:54.321 --> 35:57.325
although maybe you'd enjoy
hearing how I shot on Super 8

35:57.357 --> 36:00.062
and digitized to an mpeg video
file for post production

36:00.095 --> 36:02.029
and then did a kinescope
transfer back to Super 8

36:02.062 --> 36:05.166
for projection. Just kidding.

36:05.200 --> 36:06.435
Excessive detail.

36:06.468 --> 36:08.636
- Good one, Jeremiah.
- Thanks.

36:08.669 --> 36:11.807
But seriously, Raj,
Divya, this is for you.

36:16.745 --> 36:18.513
Here we go.

36:20.582 --> 36:22.951
<i>All the king's horses
and all the king's men</i>

36:22.984 --> 36:26.087
<i>couldn't put Humpty together again.</i>

36:26.120 --> 36:30.925
<i>I wonder if Mr. Humpty ever had
four children under three?</i>

36:30.959 --> 36:32.594
<i>Diddle, diddle, dumpling.</i>

36:32.627 --> 36:35.529
<i>My son John went to bed
with his pants still on.</i>

36:35.562 --> 36:38.566
This is how you read it?
You didn't do the voice.

36:38.600 --> 36:40.769
<i>"Diddle, diddle dum... "</i>

36:40.801 --> 36:42.403
<i>I think I might have screwed that up.</i>

36:43.937 --> 36:45.906

36:50.144 --> 36:52.246
<i>♪ Climbed up that spout again ♪</i>

36:52.279 --> 36:53.881
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

<i>Hickory dickory dock.</i>

36:56.283 --> 36:58.686
<i>The mouse ran up the c...

36:58.720 --> 37:00.321
<i>I really wanted to do
"Diddle, Diddle, Dumpling."</i>

37:00.354 --> 37:03.324
<i>I can't...</i> Aw.

37:03.357 --> 37:05.526
<i>If there's any mom who can
raise a son to be as sweet...</i>

37:05.560 --> 37:07.429
- Son? You're having a boy?
- I was just...

37:07.461 --> 37:09.263
I was just talking out loud.

37:09.296 --> 37:11.031
I don't know what I was saying.

37:11.064 --> 37:13.367
<i>As my sweet husband it's you, Divya.</i>

37:13.401 --> 37:16.238
<i>Hello, sibling of Sashi.</i>

37:16.270 --> 37:17.973
<i>This is your Uncle Hank.</i>

37:18.006 --> 37:20.642
<i>You will come to know
me as the smart one,</i>

37:20.674 --> 37:23.044
<i>the fun one, the cool one.</i>

37:23.077 --> 37:26.281
<i>No, no, no. Listen. I am your favorite.</i>

37:26.314 --> 37:27.783
<i>I am Uncle Evan, okay?</i>

37:27.816 --> 37:29.551
<i>AKA your mother's favorite
person in the universe.</i>

37:29.584 --> 37:30.719
<i>She loves me so much...</i>

37:30.752 --> 37:31.920
- What? <i>
- Hold on a second.</i>

37:31.953 --> 37:33.088
"In the universe."

37:33.120 --> 37:34.689
<i>I just had an idea.</i>

37:36.390 --> 37:38.726
<i>This is called dancing.</i>

37:38.760 --> 37:40.294
<i>To one of the classics.</i>

37:45.834 --> 37:48.370
<i>We are all so proud of your mother.</i>

37:48.403 --> 37:51.540
<i>"Who graduated first
in her class at Johns Hopkins."</i>

37:51.573 --> 37:52.641
<i>"Stony Brook."</i>

37:52.673 --> 37:54.341
<i>"Johns Hopkins." "Stony Brook."</i>

37:54.374 --> 37:57.478
<i>"Einstein... Johns Hopkins."</i>

37:57.511 --> 37:59.080
<i>We cannot wait to meet you.</i>

37:59.113 --> 38:00.714
<i>We love you already.</i>

38:00.747 --> 38:02.316
<i>That's "Evan."</i>

38:02.350 --> 38:03.985
<i>Evan. E-V-A...</i>

38:04.017 --> 38:06.253
<i>Hi, Mommy and the new baby.</i>

38:06.287 --> 38:08.723
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

38:08.756 --> 38:10.826
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

38:10.859 --> 38:14.162
Awesome, awesome.

38:14.194 --> 38:16.263
Please. It is a work in progress.

38:16.296 --> 38:18.266
And I loved it.

38:25.073 --> 38:26.875
Wow.

38:26.908 --> 38:30.278
This is going to be much more
difficult than I thought.

38:30.310 --> 38:34.015
For the first time I think I'm realizing

38:34.048 --> 38:35.616
that this baby won't be growing up

38:35.649 --> 38:39.354
surrounded by you guys every
day the way Sashi has.

38:39.386 --> 38:42.857
Okay. I am not going to
think about it, though,

38:42.890 --> 38:44.992
because if I do, I'm
going to start crying,

38:45.026 --> 38:46.528
and I probably won't be able to stop.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.631
So, um... thank you, Raj.

38:49.664 --> 38:52.933
And thank you, Jeremiah.

38:52.966 --> 38:55.269
Thank you all.

38:55.303 --> 38:57.638
I hope you all know how much I love you.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.206
Yes, even you, Evan.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.075
Thank you.

39:01.109 --> 39:04.980
So, uh... I am not going to Stony Brook.

39:05.013 --> 39:06.381
You're going to Johns Hopkins!

39:06.414 --> 39:08.350
Oh, my... you got in? That's amazing!

39:08.383 --> 39:09.451
I knew you would be accepted.

39:09.484 --> 39:12.287
No, uh... I'm still waitlisted.

39:12.319 --> 39:15.957
I decided on the way
here, and Raj agrees,

39:15.990 --> 39:18.126
that if I don't get
into my first choice,

39:18.158 --> 39:19.794
then I'll try again next year.

39:19.827 --> 39:23.531
When it comes to this dream,
I do not want to settle.

39:23.564 --> 39:24.832
And I won't.

39:24.865 --> 39:26.634
Good for you, Divs.

39:28.202 --> 39:30.772
- I know you'll get in.
- Thank you.

39:30.805 --> 39:33.341
Divya, really, I'm so happy for you.

39:33.374 --> 39:36.011
I'm just... I'm a little surprised.

39:36.044 --> 39:38.914
I mean... it's kind of a big risk, no?

39:38.946 --> 39:40.515
Are you sure?

39:40.548 --> 39:42.651
Yes. I've already called Stony Brook,

39:42.683 --> 39:45.086
and someone on their waitlist
will be accepted in my place.

39:45.118 --> 39:47.055
- Oh.
- You can always do research

39:47.087 --> 39:48.423
with me here during the winter.

39:48.455 --> 39:51.425
And work at HankMed. This
is gonna be awesome.

39:51.459 --> 39:53.028
Thank you.

39:53.060 --> 39:55.229
Oh!

40:04.372 --> 40:06.408
Really?

40:22.656 --> 40:24.859
Are you kidding me?

40:34.301 --> 40:36.270
Yeah.
