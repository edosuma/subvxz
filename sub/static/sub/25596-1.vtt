one phrase.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.305
Sarah, right?
She's a Naval surgeon, isn't she?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.851
She is. She also minored
in language

12:09.938 --> 12:11.304
and East Asian studies

12:11.439 --> 12:13.852
- at Annapolis.
- And your twins, Henry and Georgia.

12:14.525 --> 12:15.561
You know your stuff.

12:16.361 --> 12:17.818
You are the very first family

12:17.904 --> 12:20.317
we have had in the residential
section of The Pearl.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.382
I thought it might be
a good test for us.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.241
Well, they absolutely love it.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.068
It's their first visit
to Hong Kong.

12:27.247 --> 12:28.658
Ah, here they are.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.331
Allow me to introduce
my head of personal security,

12:31.417 --> 12:33.374
Ajani Okeke, and Mr. Pierce

12:33.461 --> 12:35.202
from the Hawthorne-Stone
Insurance Group.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.457
A pleasure.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.544
- Very nice to meet you Mr. Sawyer.
- Likewise.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.718
After your independent
third-party assessment is approved,

12:42.804 --> 12:44.564
they will confirm
full coverage of The Pearl,

12:44.597 --> 12:45.838
which I'm told

12:45.932 --> 12:47.719
will carry
the most expensive premium

12:47.809 --> 12:50.643
for a single structure
in underwriting history.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.766
So, shall we begin?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.267

12:56.109 --> 12:57.725
WILL:
The Pearl's anti-fire measures

12:57.819 --> 13:00.687
employ a one-of-a-kind
self-sealing ventilation system

13:00.780 --> 13:03.113
and a robust sprinkler
and CO2 array

13:03.199 --> 13:05.657
which can put out a fire
in a fraction of the time.

13:06.244 --> 13:09.828
All monitored by a control facility
located over a mile away.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.873
You hired me to assess your safety
and security systems

13:12.959 --> 13:15.747
and after a complete analysis,
I can say that it's the safest

13:15.837 --> 13:17.373

in the world.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.085
It's Fort Knox,
a mile in the sky.

13:20.842 --> 13:23.425
Once I inspect the security
at the off-site facility,

13:23.511 --> 13:24.797
my job will be done,

13:25.972 --> 13:28.134
and you can open
the residential upper half.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.557

for the job.

Once linked
to your biometric data,

13:44.532 --> 13:46.740
you'll be the only one
who can access it.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.403
Ben will take you
to our off-site facility

13:50.496 --> 13:52.176

everything checks out.

- You paid him.
- Yes.

01:15:54.216 --> 01:15:55.360
But what he didn't know
was that

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.751
<i>I hid tracking software
inside my wire transfer.</i>

01:15:58.596 --> 01:16:00.383
<i>As Botha
laundered my payments</i>

01:16:00.473 --> 01:16:01.839
<i>through their
offshore accounts,</i>

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.719
<i>I was able to trace
every transaction,</i>

01:16:04.060 --> 01:16:05.551
<i>giving me
their bank accounts,</i>

01:16:05.644 --> 01:16:07.636
<i>their names,
their identities.</i>

01:16:08.689 --> 01:16:10.646
This was my insurance policy.

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.933
Botha would never be able
to extort money from me again.

01:16:13.235 --> 01:16:15.818
But when the syndicates found out that
they were compromised,

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:19.426
<i>they threatened to destroy Botha if he
didn't clean up his mess.</i>

01:16:20.242 --> 01:16:21.553
<i>If he kills me,
the copies I've made</i>

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:23.569
<i>will be sent
to the authorities.</i>

01:16:24.121 --> 01:16:26.613
But if he gets his hands on
this, the original,

01:16:26.707 --> 01:16:29.074
he can reverse engineer
my tracking software

01:16:29.168 --> 01:16:31.501
and hide the identities
before anyone's the wiser.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.583
So, he lit
this entire building on fire

01:16:33.672 --> 01:16:36.872
knowing that you would take the most
valuable thing in this world to you and run.

01:16:36.967 --> 01:16:38.833
- And his plan worked.
- Not yet, it hasn't.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:43.714
We're gonna give Botha
what he came here for.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.016
As soon as he has the drive,
he'll kill us both.

01:16:49.313 --> 01:16:50.804
Maybe.

01:16:51.774 --> 01:16:53.231
But he has my daughter.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.650
And her life is what matters
to me, not mine.

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:59.175
Now, I'm taking that drive
to the roof.

01:17:00.116 --> 01:17:01.903
