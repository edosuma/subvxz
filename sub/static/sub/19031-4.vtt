WEBVTT

00:01.842 --> 00:03.576
being in med school

00:03.577 --> 00:05.611
Is kinda like
being in basic training,

00:05.612 --> 00:08.047
And the professors are like
drill sergeants.

00:08.048 --> 00:10.983
Some rule with an iron fist...
Do you feel
the spit raining down

00:10.984 --> 00:14.053
On your face, maggot?!
And will you ever forget

00:14.054 --> 00:16.989
The excessive production of
saliva is a condition known as

00:16.990 --> 00:19.992
Sia-lor-rhea!
Sialorrhea! Huh!

00:19.993 --> 00:22.061
Sir, no, sir!

00:22.062 --> 00:24.130
Others carry a big stick.

00:24.131 --> 00:26.566
You wanna become a doctor?

00:26.567 --> 00:28.467
Well,
you're gonna have to work.

00:28.468 --> 00:30.436
Work your little scrubs off.

00:30.437 --> 00:32.805
is this
the speech from "fame"?

00:32.806 --> 00:34.307
You want fame?

00:34.308 --> 00:36.175
Well, fame costs.

00:36.176 --> 00:38.678
Our only hope
for getting through it--

00:38.679 --> 00:40.213
Teamwork.

00:40.214 --> 00:43.282
Unfortunately, we all
just looked out for ourselves.

00:43.283 --> 00:45.885
Cole,
I need the retractor.
I'm using it right now.

00:45.886 --> 00:49.155
Seriously?
Yeah. I don't like
touching bread. Creeps me out.

00:49.156 --> 00:51.691
Give him
the stupid retractor!
What?

00:51.692 --> 00:53.526
gimme my sandwich!

00:58.732 --> 01:00.333
Who did this?

01:05.839 --> 01:08.975
if you want to
keep sleeping with me,

01:08.976 --> 01:11.510
I expect you
to have my back.

01:11.511 --> 01:13.980
God, you got so many rules!
Get your back,

01:13.981 --> 01:16.983
Listen to you when you talk,
stay out of your purse.

01:16.984 --> 01:19.518
Damn, girl.
Quit playing games.

01:19.519 --> 01:21.520
At least
the weekend was coming.

01:21.521 --> 01:24.557
We needed some fun,
and cole was throwing a party.

01:24.558 --> 01:26.058
fame!

01:26.059 --> 01:28.527
this weekend
was gonna be amazing.

01:28.528 --> 01:31.631
I was spending it
with the love of my life.
Elliot gone?

01:31.632 --> 01:34.667
Gone. Carla?
Long gone
and took the kids.

01:34.668 --> 01:37.670
Nice! Bro-a-palooza
has offily begun.

01:37.671 --> 01:39.438
We're not calling it
bro-a-palooza.

01:39.439 --> 01:42.775
Why not?
I already made t-shirts.
That's awesome.
Where's mine?

01:42.776 --> 01:44.744
We're not calling it
this is yours!Ro-a-palooza.

01:44.745 --> 01:49.015
I've decided to no longer
refer to you two as "pathetic."

01:49.016 --> 01:51.984
Well, thanks, perry.
Instead,
since my nephew gave me

01:51.985 --> 01:54.553
My very first thesaurus
as a birthday present,

01:54.554 --> 01:57.523
I'm going to allow you
to choose from the following,

01:57.524 --> 02:00.526
If you will--miserable, pitiful,
sorry, wretched, deplorable,

02:00.527 --> 02:02.929
Regrettable or... Sad.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.898
"wretched" sounds like dickens.
We'll go with wretched.

02:05.899 --> 02:08.967
Nah, it's just old man doesn't
understand two young guns...

02:08.969 --> 02:10.902
P-p-p-pow!
Out on the town.

02:10.904 --> 02:12.939
He doesn't get
bro-a-palooza.

02:12.940 --> 02:15.308
"8:00 p.M.
To question mark."

02:15.309 --> 02:19.478
That means we don't even know
when it ends.
So many things
to tear apart here...

02:19.479 --> 02:22.715
I'll focus on your delusion
that you are still young.

02:22.716 --> 02:25.651
You're both much closer to 40
than you are 20.

02:25.652 --> 02:28.120
Let's face it.
You're just like me--

02:28.121 --> 02:30.656
Old, tired and you gotta get up
a lot at night to take a pee.

02:30.657 --> 02:32.792
Is he psychic?
Hey, field hockey,

02:32.793 --> 02:34.994
Your med students
are acting like animals.

02:36.530 --> 02:39.865
Ugh! You think licking will stop
me? I've eaten out of dumpsters.

02:39.866 --> 02:43.736
They're not
my med students.
They are, because
you are their faculty advisor.

02:43.737 --> 02:46.439
You will advise them to start
working together like a team.

02:46.440 --> 02:49.208
And even more importantly,
you will teach them

02:49.209 --> 02:52.078
To never, ever again
lay their grubby paws

02:52.079 --> 02:54.080
On my glazed doughnut.

02:54.081 --> 02:58.484
It is the one sprinkled, sugary
beacon of light left in my life.

03:00.120 --> 03:02.388
But they're not my students.
Actually, they are,

03:02.389 --> 03:04.290
Because you're their faculty--
student advisor.

03:04.291 --> 03:07.259
So you will advise them
that if they want to

03:07.260 --> 03:10.229
Get through med school,
they have to work together.

03:10.230 --> 03:12.431
Oh, and don't touch doughnuts.
They're beacons of light...

03:12.432 --> 03:14.266
Or whatever.
When did I become
the student advisor?

03:14.267 --> 03:17.236
When you slept with
the faculty advisor.
Your mom's
the faculty advisor?

03:17.237 --> 03:19.171
Joke's on you.
My mom's dead.

03:19.172 --> 03:20.673
Really?

03:20.674 --> 03:22.675
You guys
coming to my party?

03:22.676 --> 03:24.677
Yes. I cannot wait
to wear a dress

03:24.678 --> 03:26.579
And have a reason
to actually shave again.

03:26.580 --> 03:29.081
It is like the friin' amazon
down there.

03:29.082 --> 03:31.650
too far, too far, too far.

03:31.651 --> 03:33.652
Gonna be nuts to butts
up in that piece.

03:33.653 --> 03:36.522
Big ol' wrangle-dangle!
Yeah, you're making it
sound horrible,

03:36.523 --> 03:39.525
But I'm still gonna go. I need
to have some fun. I've spent

03:39.526 --> 03:42.194
The last three weekends
finishing up community service.

03:42.195 --> 03:43.896
I'm sorry.
I was under the impression

03:43.897 --> 03:46.565
You'd all be much younger.

03:46.566 --> 03:48.501
Turns out dinosaur costumes
are extremely flammable.

03:48.502 --> 03:50.936
I think we all
need to let loose,

03:50.937 --> 03:55.207
And in my case, let lucy.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.576
Oh...

03:57.577 --> 04:00.312
Hello, murderers, butchers,
slaughterers, slayers.

04:00.313 --> 04:01.947
I love this thing.

04:01.948 --> 04:04.283
Uh, did you hear
that I was quitting?
I did, ted.

04:04.284 --> 04:06.986
I just haven't really figured
out how to pretend I care yet.

04:06.987 --> 04:08.454
Understandable.

04:08.455 --> 04:10.423
Theodore, I always
assumed that someday

04:10.424 --> 04:14.760
We'd just find you dead
in your office.
Yeah, that was the dream.

04:14.761 --> 04:17.630
But the h and I are gonna
take some time off

04:17.630 --> 04:20.399
And tour the country.
We've written a song
for every state.

04:20.399 --> 04:22.835
I'm sure I'll hear all of them
when I die and go to hell.

04:24.137 --> 04:26.238
Damn elevator.

04:28.000 --> 04:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:46.460 --> 04:47.626
I'm out.

04:52.307 --> 05:05.940
<i>Sync By: YesCool
www.addic7ed.com</i>

05:08.606 --> 05:10.607
Phase one of bro-a-palooza
starts now.

05:10.608 --> 05:13.009
- I'm making quesadillas.
- Pepper jack?

05:13.010 --> 05:15.779
Who you talking to?

05:19.417 --> 05:21.518
I see with your wives
out of town,

05:21.519 --> 05:24.220
You've whipped yourselves
into a lesbian frenzy.

05:24.221 --> 05:25.917
What do I need to get, a garden
hose to separate you two?

05:25.918 --> 05:28.315
You can't separate us.
We're attached by fun.

05:28.392 --> 05:32.262
And tonighs gonna be awesome.
He just fell from the ceiling.
We're not gonna address that?

05:32.263 --> 05:34.698
Your loser-palooza
is embarrassing,

05:34.699 --> 05:37.500
And I'll be honest with you--
I would have assumed that

05:37.501 --> 05:39.669
Two "hip young guys"
such as yourselves

05:39.670 --> 05:42.972
Would be headed to
the big med school party.
There's a party?

05:42.973 --> 05:44.974
What's the theme--
murder/mystery?

05:44.975 --> 05:48.578
Disco? "star wars"? '60s,
'70s, '80s, '90s? The future?

05:48.579 --> 05:50.613
Please say
it's a "star wars"-themed

05:50.614 --> 05:53.283
Murder/mystery
set in the roaring '20s.

05:53.284 --> 05:55.885
The theme is
cowboys and indians.

05:55.886 --> 05:57.721
yes!
we are there.

05:57.722 --> 05:59.956
Cowboys and indians--
not my first choice.

05:59.957 --> 06:01.991
But I do have chaps.

06:01.992 --> 06:05.061
I'm liking my new dress.
It makes my boobs look even.

06:05.062 --> 06:06.796
Okay.

06:06.797 --> 06:09.365
I'm getting so much
better at making friends.

06:09.366 --> 06:12.635
Boom! Looks like the bassist
and drummer from nickelback

06:12.636 --> 06:15.004
Are rolling through the party.
Acoustic set, yo.

06:15.005 --> 06:17.140
Please tell me some
of your super-solid bros

06:17.141 --> 06:19.309
From prep school will be there.
Topher and boots
are en route.

06:19.310 --> 06:21.978
Where's everyone going? Nice
dress. Your boobs look weird.

06:21.979 --> 06:25.014
From pre not from up here.Here.
Going to my party.S
are en route.

06:25.015 --> 06:26.683
That's not happening.

06:26.684 --> 06:29.018
Tonight we're trying a little
exercise in team building.

06:29.019 --> 06:31.821
No one leaves until
you take final interviews

06:31.822 --> 06:34.491
From the four teal patients
on this floor.
What's a final interview?

06:34.492 --> 06:36.860
It's a chance for old,
dying people to bore you

06:36.861 --> 06:39.796
With their life story
before they kick it.
No, denise. Have some respect.

06:39.797 --> 06:42.132
A final interview isn't
some inconsequential thing

06:42.133 --> 06:44.601
A med student
can just blow through.

06:44.602 --> 06:47.403
It actually really matters. Now
hold my pepper jack, please.

06:47.404 --> 06:49.272
Come with me, children.

06:49.273 --> 06:51.407
Hold it like a baby bird,
denise. Pepper "j" bruises.

06:51.408 --> 06:54.410
you have the sacred privilege
of being with someone

06:54.411 --> 06:58.248
And recording their precious
memories as they prepare to die.

06:58.249 --> 07:00.216
I'm dying?

07:00.217 --> 07:02.952
No, not dying.
Just tonsillitis.

07:02.953 --> 07:06.356
So you get to gargle.
gargle, gargle!

07:06.357 --> 07:10.093
Why would
you let me go in there?
Why would I stop you?
This is good cheese.

07:10.094 --> 07:12.762
Get off my cheese!

07:12.763 --> 07:15.498
How long do final interviews
with actual dying people take?

07:15.499 --> 07:17.667
If you work togeth,
it'll go faster.

07:17.668 --> 07:19.636
But let me make
this very clear--

07:19.637 --> 07:21.905
No one leaves
until you're all done.

07:21.906 --> 07:24.240
All done or none done.

07:24.241 --> 07:28.311
damn.
Boots is gonna be pissed.

07:39.056 --> 07:41.057
You have the voice
of an angel.

07:41.058 --> 07:43.092
Oh, thank you.
Oh, thank you, sir.

07:43.093 --> 07:45.328
Not you, ted
if I were ten years younger,

07:45.329 --> 07:49.532
And you were
ten years younger--
it's too late, sir.
I've already tapped it.

07:49.533 --> 07:53.236
Ted buckland!
I'm sorry.
He brings it out of me.

07:53.237 --> 07:56.206
It's okay. I didn't always
treat teddy very well.

07:56.207 --> 07:59.742
Say, how about we do
a last night out on the town?

07:59.743 --> 08:01.711
Let me give you
a proper send-off.

08:01.712 --> 08:04.380
That would mean a lot, sir.

08:04.381 --> 08:06.883
Ted!
I'sorry. It's him!

08:10.421 --> 08:12.388
An indian
wouldn't wear chaps.

08:12.389 --> 08:14.224
You're forgetting
my backstory.

08:14.225 --> 08:16.326
I killed a cowboy,
then took his chaps.

08:16.327 --> 08:18.094
I'm also a sheriff.

08:18.095 --> 08:21.698
it's not a theme party,
is it?

08:21.699 --> 08:24.868
No, but thank you for the great
early birthday present.

08:24.869 --> 08:27.370
Say cheese.

08:27.371 --> 08:29.706
Well done, girls.
The hell with it.
I'm goin' in.

08:29.707 --> 08:32.575
Maybe no one will notice.
Try and blend in.

08:32.576 --> 08:36.980
black cowboy?
Son, what are you doing?

08:36.981 --> 08:39.082
Me? He's the indian
wearing chaps.

08:39.082 --> 08:41.618
When it works, it works.
I'm also a sheriff.

08:41.619 --> 08:43.219
What are you guys
doing here anyway?

08:43.220 --> 08:45.188
Picking up some extra cash.
We do bar security,

08:45.189 --> 08:49.592
Bouncy house rentals--
we got a line--
we have a line
of homemade salsa.

08:49.593 --> 08:53.563
Shut your face, frank. I was
gonna tell 'em about the salsa.
Copy that.

08:53.564 --> 08:55.765
I don't have
you guys on the list.

08:55.766 --> 08:57.834
It's probably under "d"
for dr. D.,

08:57.835 --> 09:00.470
Or, um, maybe dr. Dizzle,
perhaps d-to-the-izzle?

09:00.471 --> 09:02.739
Oh, here.
We have a d. Izzle.
That's probably it.

09:02.740 --> 09:06.576
I'm dave izzle.

09:06.577 --> 09:08.845
Hey, hey! It's special "k."
howdy.

09:08.846 --> 09:13.182
Melvis, frank. Listen, that
salsa was in-frickin'-sane.

09:13.183 --> 09:17.120
These are my plus two.
Dr. Kelso, do you think you?

09:17.121 --> 09:19.489
You're gonna have to
ask ted about that

09:19.490 --> 09:21.224
Because this is ted's night.

09:21.225 --> 09:23.293
Ted?
I'm going to say yes,

09:23.294 --> 09:26.095
But I've never had
this kind of power before,

09:26.096 --> 09:28.498
So I'm going to milk it,
okay?

09:28.499 --> 09:31.034
Go ahead. Do your thing.
I mean, you gotta...
You...

09:35.873 --> 09:38.041
Let it be so!

09:38.042 --> 09:39.876
Oh, amen.

09:39.877 --> 09:42.245
We have to ask them
25 questions?

09:42.246 --> 09:44.614
This is gonna take
forever.

09:44.615 --> 09:46.482
Ain't no proem, luce.
It's just...

09:52.222 --> 09:54.891
man,
I just thought of that.

09:54.892 --> 09:57.827
Damn,
I'm gonna be a good doctor.

09:57.828 --> 09:59.829
Look, we'll split up
the patients, okay?

09:59.830 --> 10:01.731
It'll be quick and easy,

10:01.732 --> 10:03.700
And then we can
get to cole's party.

10:06.170 --> 10:07.637
Done.

10:07.638 --> 10:09.138
Done.

10:09.139 --> 10:10.974
Super done.
My dude is dead. Mm.

10:14.211 --> 10:17.613
Peace! Gotta go drown
my sorrows with a jagerbomb.

10:17.614 --> 10:19.816
Where's lucy?

10:19.817 --> 10:23.419
Um...
What is your birth date?

10:23.420 --> 10:25.922
Probably just find that
in the chart.

10:25.923 --> 10:28.992
Uh... How about...
Are you married?

10:28.993 --> 10:30.994
Okay.

10:30.995 --> 10:33.496
Do you think
that when bears hibernate,

10:33.497 --> 10:36.065
They have
super long dreams?
What?

10:36.066 --> 10:38.668
You spoke. I got you!
Now you owe me an answer.

10:38.669 --> 10:40.670
You know, tit for tat...

10:40.671 --> 10:42.972
Which, by the way,
is a horrible expression.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.407
It sous...
pornographic.

10:44.408 --> 10:46.409
Listen, girlie,
I'm not interested

10:46.410 --> 10:49.412
In answering a bunch of
stupid questions off of a form,

10:49.413 --> 10:52.315
So why don't you just
leave me the hell alone?
Great.

10:52.316 --> 10:56.019
Well, I guess it's time
for a little good-bye toast.

10:56.020 --> 10:59.022
Aw, I'm not really
much of a toast guy.

10:59.023 --> 11:00.356
A fond farewell...

11:00.357 --> 11:03.426
To that skanky blonde
heading out the door.

11:03.427 --> 11:06.262
I'm gonna see what other
chickens are in the coop.

11:11.969 --> 11:13.936
11 seconds--
you beat your record.

11:13.937 --> 11:15.972
Whoo! I'm spinning!

11:15.973 --> 11:18.441
Maybe next time
you should try it with alcohol

11:18.442 --> 11:21.277
Instead of soda.
Don'be insane.
This is awesome.

11:21.278 --> 11:24.280
Yeah, it is.
We're lettin' 'em know!
True dat!

11:24.281 --> 11:27.784
Who and--and what
are  letting know?

11:27.785 --> 11:30.286
Mine won't talk.
He wasn't even intrigued by

11:30.287 --> 11:33.589
My bear hibernation question.
For the last time, they
don't dream, and nobody cares.

11:33.590 --> 11:35.625
They do,
and everybody cares.

11:35.626 --> 11:38.494
I'm sorry about your party,
but I was very clear--

11:38.495 --> 11:40.930
All done or none done.

11:40.931 --> 11:43.800
Hey, guys?
My patient just died.

11:43.801 --> 11:46.235
I'm feeling a little too upset
to keep working.

11:46.236 --> 11:49.005
Really?
What was his name?

11:49.006 --> 11:51.674
Look, I can't do this
right now, drew! I'm hurtin'!

11:54.678 --> 11:56.512
You're really gonna
leave us?

11:56.513 --> 11:59.515
I don't know if you can see
how much my soul dies

11:59.516 --> 12:02.018
Every time
I let you back into my bed,

12:02.019 --> 12:05.021
But it would make me hate
myself, like, four notches less

12:05.022 --> 12:08.157
If I thought you had
one decent bone in your body.

12:08.158 --> 12:10.726
Please don't laugh
because I said "bone."

12:10.727 --> 12:13.196
Hey, look, baby,
I would love to stay,

12:13.197 --> 12:15.965
But I just don't want to.

12:27.077 --> 12:29.579
Whoo! Good one.
Whoo! Good one, boy!

12:29.580 --> 12:32.248
Please, please tell me that
this is just an intermission

12:32.249 --> 12:34.550
Because I don't want
this show to ever end.

12:34.551 --> 12:38.221
Why are you re, perry?
To laugh, to cry,
to cry from laughing,

12:38.222 --> 12:40.523
But mostly to laugh
at two desperate guys

12:40.524 --> 12:43.025
On an ice slide
to an irrelevant middle age.

12:43.026 --> 12:45.528
Well, not only have we been
lettin' 'em know--

12:45.529 --> 12:48.531
Is--is that
the correct expression?
Oh, that's it, right there--
lettin' 'em know.

12:48.532 --> 12:50.466
Well,
we've been lettin' 'em know

12:50.467 --> 12:52.768
By doing the cabbage patch...

12:52.769 --> 12:55.872
E running man
and the capoeira.
That's right.
That's brazilian dance fightin'.

12:55.873 --> 12:57.840
in your face!
Where's the jackass?

12:57.841 --> 12:59.375
jackass, come!

12:59.376 --> 13:01.377
What up?

13:01.378 --> 13:04.380
Now you are the host of
this party, and to some extent,

13:04.381 --> 13:07.416
The voice of your generation.
And while I sadly acknowledge

13:07.417 --> 13:09.252
That heralds
the coming apocalypse,

13:09.253 --> 13:11.787
I do value your opinion
on one thing in particular.

13:11.788 --> 13:14.190
Wow.
You're like shakespeare, yo.

13:14.191 --> 13:16.292
I am. I am
"like shakespeare, yo."

13:16.293 --> 13:19.295
Now look around the room
real quick and tell me

13:19.296 --> 13:21.030
The five lamest people
that you see.

13:21.031 --> 13:23.065
Feel free to start with me.

13:23.066 --> 13:26.068
Cool. One--old.

13:26.069 --> 13:28.704
Two--bald and shiny.

13:28.705 --> 13:31.240
Three--super old,

13:31.241 --> 13:34.544
Four--checked out my junk
at the urinal,

13:34.545 --> 13:38.281
And... Five--has weird junk.
Number four told me.

13:38.282 --> 13:40.950
We didn't make the list!
nope, we didn't.

13:40.951 --> 13:43.452
You've just been served.
Yeah, and you know what?

13:43.453 --> 13:45.755
We're gonna rub it
in your face a little bit

13:45.756 --> 13:47.823
By doing some
brazilian fight dancing.

13:47.824 --> 13:50.226
Five, six, seven, eight...
Capoeira, capoeira.

13:58.268 --> 14:00.803
that was outstanding!

14:00.804 --> 14:04.106
sometimes, reality takes
the form of a kick to the head.

14:04.107 --> 14:07.109
Sorry, bros. You just moved up
to the numbers one and two spots

14:07.110 --> 14:10.146
On my lame list.
Well, I think turk
should be number one

14:10.147 --> 14:12.915
Because he appears
to be bleeding.

14:12.916 --> 14:15.685
Other times, it gets
right up in your grill.

14:15.686 --> 14:17.353
Why would you page me?

14:17.354 --> 14:20.022
Paul just wants to be
left alone.
Just let us go.

14:20.023 --> 14:22.725
We'll come back in the morning
and take another shot at him.

14:22.726 --> 14:26.162
Great. I'll go talk to his liver
and tell it to stop failing.

14:26.163 --> 14:28.130
You don't get it, do you?

14:28.131 --> 14:30.633
Patients don't do things
on your schedule.

14:30.634 --> 14:33.636
This isn't high school, guys.
This is real. You know what?

14:33.637 --> 14:36.739
Do whatever you want.
I don't give a rat's ass.

14:36.740 --> 14:39.909
Just make sure
you can live with yourself.

14:45.265 --> 14:48.300
I'm really sorry, c-bear.
I had no idea my range of motion

14:48.301 --> 14:51.303
Would be so incredible in these chaps.
That's a lie. I totally knew.

14:51.304 --> 14:53.372
I can't believe
I let you sew my eye up

14:53.373 --> 14:56.141
After l the soda you had.
This night definitely didn't turn out

14:56.142 --> 14:58.143
The way I hoped it would.

14:58.144 --> 15:01.446
Oh, hey! Hey!

15:01.447 --> 15:04.049
Did you have us
in the chairs again?

15:04.050 --> 15:07.085
We weren't getting married,
turk. We were becoming men.

15:07.086 --> 15:09.354
Hey. Did you guys dress up
for the kids in the cancer ward?

15:09.355 --> 15:11.089
Yes. We...
Yeah. Yes.

15:11.090 --> 15:13.759
That's what we were...
Yeah,
and then what happened was

15:13.760 --> 15:16.662
One of the kids hit me
in the head with a toy.

15:16.663 --> 15:18.664
Yeah. 'cause he was mad.

15:18.665 --> 15:20.732
'cause he had the cancer.

15:20.733 --> 15:23.902
Okay. We're just...
Hey, how did
the final interviews go?

15:23.903 --> 15:25.404
Not perft.

15:25.405 --> 15:29.041
But we decided as a group
that we can live with ourselves.

15:29.042 --> 15:31.276
Well, I know
those things are hard.

15:31.277 --> 15:33.679
Turk and I had to do one
last year.

15:33.680 --> 15:36.148
We couldn't get the guy
to say a word.

15:36.149 --> 15:38.283
We ended up skipping
our big steak night,

15:38.284 --> 15:41.553
And we just spent hours
talking to him.
He had a lot
he needed to say

15:41.554 --> 15:44.156
Before he passed on.
Yeah, it definely
meant a lot to him.

15:44.157 --> 15:46.658
I gotta say for me, though,
it was probably

15:46.659 --> 15:49.194
One of the most memorable nights
I've ever had as a doctor.
Me, too.

15:50.797 --> 15:54.666
Ka-bam!
We just dropped
a knowledge bomb on your asses.

15:57.070 --> 15:59.037
dr. Turk was right.

15:59.038 --> 16:02.074
A knowledge bomb had been
dropped on our asses,

16:02.075 --> 16:04.543
So we decided
to take another shot

16:04.544 --> 16:07.512
Even though paul wasn't
gonna talk to any of us.

16:07.513 --> 16:10.382
what up, nerds?
Hey, this paul dude is awesome.

16:10.383 --> 16:12.784
He nailed marilyn monroe!

16:12.785 --> 16:15.253
Oh, no. It was actually
marilyn montrose.

16:15.254 --> 16:18.256
Same diff.
Chicks named marilyn are hot.

16:18.257 --> 16:21.393
I can't believe you came back.
It wasn't my idea.
Denise made me.

16:21.394 --> 16:24.162
How'd you get him to talk?
We had a conversation.

16:24.163 --> 16:26.832
All hot stuff here did
was ask questions off a form.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.835
Are you, uh, choosing to
smile and ignore the insult

16:29.836 --> 16:32.170
'cause he called you
"hot stuff"? Attagirl.

16:32.171 --> 16:35.140
Hey, did you know paulie got
a purple heart in korea?

16:35.141 --> 16:37.309
I didn't even know
we fought korea!

16:37.310 --> 16:39.444
So, paul, how'd you get
your purple heart?

16:39.445 --> 16:41.747
Come on, talk to us.

16:43.850 --> 16:46.685
Oops. That's not my drink.

16:46.686 --> 16:48.920
It's good, though.

16:48.921 --> 16:50.922
Methinks
it's quitting time.

16:50.923 --> 16:53.125
Good night, gooch.

16:53.126 --> 16:56.094
Ted.

16:56.095 --> 16:57.629
Ted?
That's it?

16:57.630 --> 17:00.599
I've been your whipping boy
for eight years,

17:00.600 --> 17:03.101
And all I get
before I disappear forever

17:03.102 --> 17:05.837
Is a wet, clammy handshake?

17:05.838 --> 17:08.773
And, yes, I know
that's from my hand, not yours.

17:08.775 --> 17:11.710
And, yes, I know that
we've never really been friends.

17:11.711 --> 17:14.613
And, yes, I know that the gooch
is way too attractive for me.

17:14.614 --> 17:16.481
That's not relevant
right now.

17:16.482 --> 17:18.784
It's just always
on my mind.

17:18.785 --> 17:21.453
Please don't leave me
for a baritone.
I won't.

17:21.454 --> 17:23.521
ted, I'm so hammered that

17:23.522 --> 17:26.525
The only thing I can think about
are those 30-cent hot dogs

17:26.526 --> 17:29.127
At the gas station,
so wrap it up.

17:29.128 --> 17:31.797
You owe me
more than a handshake.

17:31.798 --> 17:34.099
Let's go, honey.

17:39.305 --> 17:41.740
That's not my drink, either.

17:41.741 --> 17:45.077
In war, you have to
make the hard choices,

17:45.078 --> 17:47.012
So I shot the man,

17:47.013 --> 17:49.347
But I'll never forget
his face.

17:49.348 --> 17:51.450
No way.
You wasted a dude?

17:51.451 --> 17:53.985
Hey,
my buddy killed a guy once.

17:53.986 --> 17:57.522
Backed right over him
in a mini mall. It was crazy.
Yeah, that's the same.

17:57.523 --> 18:00.625
I can't believe you were our age
when all that happened.
Yeah, you and me, both.

18:00.626 --> 18:02.727
Some of our guys
never made it home.

18:02.728 --> 18:04.996
The rest of us
tried to keep in touch,

18:04.997 --> 18:07.499
But, you know,
life gets in the way.

18:07.500 --> 18:10.001
I haven't seen any of them
for years,

18:10.002 --> 18:12.537
But I think about them
all the time.

18:12.538 --> 18:15.574
You know, when you spend
the hardest time in your life

18:15.575 --> 18:17.943
With a group of people,
you're bonded forever.

18:17.944 --> 18:21.346
What are you guys
still doing here?
All done, none done, remember?

18:21.347 --> 18:23.048
Wow. That crap worked.

18:23.049 --> 18:26.184
I faculty-advised
the hell out of you guys.

18:26.185 --> 18:28.753
I think
it dawned on all of us that,

18:28.754 --> 18:30.021
In a way,
we were war buddies...

18:31.791 --> 18:34.526
And we wouldn't be able
to get through med school

18:34.527 --> 18:38.063
If we didn't
have each other's backs.

18:38.064 --> 18:41.666
Leave him!
Every man for themselves!

18:41.667 --> 18:44.202
Well,
it dawned on most of us.

18:46.339 --> 18:49.341
Hey, thanks for
making cole come back.

18:49.342 --> 18:51.276
I didn't make him
come back.

18:51.277 --> 18:53.712
I really hate
talking to that guy.

18:53.713 --> 18:56.548
Adds an extra shower
to my day.

18:59.252 --> 19:01.253
I can't believe
it's been 12 years

19:01.254 --> 19:04.723
Since we
started medical school.
Wee getting old,
kemo sabe.

19:04.724 --> 19:06.825
Well, thank you, lord.
Now you do realize

19:06.826 --> 19:08.760
You could've saved yourself
a lot of embarrassment

19:08.761 --> 19:10.762
And a lot of time
and about seven stitches

19:10.763 --> 19:12.631
If you'd just admitted to that
a little earlier.

19:12.632 --> 19:14.666
Of course, it wouldn't have been
as much fun for me,

19:14.667 --> 19:16.501
And I damn sure
wouldn't have gotten

19:16.502 --> 19:18.136
This teraver.

19:18.137 --> 19:20.372
He's gonna want
a copy of that.
No, I won't.

19:20.373 --> 19:22.340
hello, christmas cards!

19:22.341 --> 19:24.376
There's nothing wrong
with getting older,

19:24.377 --> 19:26.878
So do yourself a favor--
get a prostate exam,

19:26.879 --> 19:30.148
Stop wring ironic t-shirts
and just let it happen.

19:30.149 --> 19:32.117
Sometimes we have to embrace

19:32.118 --> 19:35.120
The had truths
about ourselves,

19:35.121 --> 19:38.123
Whether it's what we really
want to do on a big night out

19:38.124 --> 19:41.126
Or realizing that
you're never as strong alone

19:41.127 --> 19:43.161
As you are together.

19:43.162 --> 19:45.130
Can't believe we found 'em.

19:45.131 --> 19:46.898
I can't believe they came.

19:46.899 --> 19:50.068
Three straps!

19:59.586 --> 20:01.653
Ted, you're not gonna
just walk out

20:01.721 --> 20:04.289
Without saying good-bye
to anyone, are you?

20:04.357 --> 20:06.291
Aw, nobody cares.

16:27.340 --> 20:09.461
We're gonna miss you.
All the best, ted.

20:09.529 --> 20:11.930
Is this more like
what you were looking for?

20:11.998 --> 20:13.799
Thank you, sir.

20:13.866 --> 20:16.401
Oh, uh...
Forgot my keys.

20:16.469 --> 20:20.072
I'll be right back!

20:20.139 --> 20:23.475
oh, got 'em! Aw.

20:24.844 --> 20:26.745
This is more appropriate.

20:26.813 --> 20:28.981
I'm gonna miss you.

20:31.384 --> 20:33.018
Bye, ted.

20:33.086 --> 20:35.554
Good-bye, bob.

20:35.622 --> 20:38.056
Well, honey, uh...

20:38.124 --> 20:40.623
Play me out.
