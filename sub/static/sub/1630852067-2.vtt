00:06.041 --> 00:09.875
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:26.666 --> 00:30.208
Could we roll up the window?
I can't feel my toes anymore.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.958
Roll up one side,
the other rolls down. Look.

00:36.916 --> 00:38.791
All right. I'm cold!

00:43.916 --> 00:45.500
How did you get that guy

00:45.583 --> 00:47.791
to give you Marcus' parents' address?

00:47.875 --> 00:50.083
I said we had switched the presents again.

00:50.666 --> 00:52.333
-Hold on. He believed you?
-No need.

00:52.916 --> 00:56.708
I offered to go out for a drink.
He stopped listening altogether.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.500
-What an idiot.
-Good job!

01:14.791 --> 01:17.041
What do you think about Marcus' track?

01:17.125 --> 01:18.875
VERNO UR THE BEST
VERNO'S PISSED

01:18.958 --> 01:21.083
I don't have time for this bullshit.

01:21.166 --> 01:23.666
The one where he says
women should shut it?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.708
-Yeah, that one.
-Tell you what, Marcus.

01:26.791 --> 01:28.500
You should shut it.

01:28.583 --> 01:31.666
Shut it. If you have something to say,
say it to my face.

01:31.750 --> 01:33.333
Stop hiding around Paris.

01:33.416 --> 01:35.500
Spit it out. Why do you hate him?

01:35.583 --> 01:37.458
You know what? Stop filming.

02:00.375 --> 02:01.208
<i>Hello?</i>

02:01.291 --> 02:02.500
I saw Verno's video.

02:02.583 --> 02:06.125
-I haven't. What does it say?
<i>-He's not in a Christmas mood.</i>

02:06.208 --> 02:07.333
What's his deal?

02:07.416 --> 02:09.458
<i>I don't want to play his game.</i>

02:09.541 --> 02:14.083
-Anyway. Have you heard from Mel?
<i>-She's still mad. She's not coming.</i>

02:14.166 --> 02:15.625
Have to do without her.

02:15.708 --> 02:17.500
My mom's going to be bummed.

02:17.583 --> 02:20.500
Come on, man.
She's happy to have you, bro.

02:20.583 --> 02:22.291
<i>-Her son.</i>
-You're not wrong.

02:22.375 --> 02:26.000
Given the situation with the old man,
it may be best not to introduce Mel now.

02:26.083 --> 02:29.416
-Isn't she the perfect daughter-in-law?
-I'm not the perfect son.

02:29.958 --> 02:30.791
Talk later.

02:40.875 --> 02:44.333
CHRISTMAS MAGIC

02:45.250 --> 02:47.166
Marcus, my son!

02:48.125 --> 02:49.750
Come in quick. It's cold.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.291
-I have the prettiest mom.
-Sure, right.

02:53.791 --> 02:56.375
Two Christmases without you.
How could you?

02:56.458 --> 02:58.625
-It's work, Mom.
-Work, sure.

02:58.708 --> 02:59.541
Here.

03:00.458 --> 03:02.500
You have something to make up for.

03:02.583 --> 03:04.708
Everyone's been dying to see you.

03:05.375 --> 03:07.041
-Everyone?
-Everyone.

03:07.125 --> 03:08.541
Today is Christmas.

03:08.625 --> 03:11.458
-No negative topics. You hear me?
-Yeah.

03:12.458 --> 03:14.166
I'll put these in some water.

03:25.250 --> 03:26.833
-Hi, everyone.
-Marcus!

03:28.125 --> 03:30.291
You found time to come see us?

03:34.500 --> 03:36.875
Glad to see the atmosphere is a delight.

03:37.875 --> 03:40.375
You lost your trial.
Not your sense of humor.

03:40.458 --> 03:42.125
-Jean-Louis.
-It's okay, Mom.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.458
Glad to see you, Dad.

03:45.333 --> 03:46.416
Hey, bro.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.833
You're less handsome than I recall.

03:48.916 --> 03:51.083
-Time hasn't been kind.
-Don't listen to him.

03:51.166 --> 03:53.375
You're more handsome than ever.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.833
-All right. Let's get to work.
-Yeah.

04:04.541 --> 04:05.625
What are all these?

04:05.708 --> 04:09.250
For all the Christmases I missed.
Mel's presents too.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.625
-Can we open the presents?
-We're waiting for Mel.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.541
He wanted to buy The Simones?

04:15.125 --> 04:16.458
-The bastard.
-Never.

04:16.541 --> 04:18.750
-Come on, champ!
-Go!

04:19.416 --> 04:22.666
Think you can use us like that?
It's an insult to women.

04:23.416 --> 04:24.791
Even your mother.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.375
I'll mention his mother.

04:29.375 --> 04:30.500
Is she on her way?

04:30.583 --> 04:32.000
No, Mom. Mel isn't…

04:33.291 --> 04:35.500
That must be her.

04:35.583 --> 04:37.333
-I'll get it.
-It's not her.

04:38.208 --> 04:41.500
I can't wait. So great to have her here.

04:41.583 --> 04:43.625
-Here she is!
-Who?

04:43.708 --> 04:45.000
Your fiancée, Mel.

04:47.625 --> 04:48.458
No…

04:57.625 --> 05:00.125
Hello! Well, I…

05:00.208 --> 05:01.958
I'm delighted to meet you.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.333
-Hello, miss.
-Hello, young man.

05:05.416 --> 05:07.875
You must be the big brother. Right?

05:09.000 --> 05:11.166
-My husband, Jean-Louis.
-Jean-Louis.

05:11.250 --> 05:12.958
My eldest, Jean-Luc.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.500
-Nice to meet you.
-His wife, Chance.

05:15.583 --> 05:17.916
-Chance…
-And my youngest.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.791
-Marie-Jeanne.
-MJ!

05:22.000 --> 05:22.958
MJ.

05:23.041 --> 05:24.625
And you know Jean-Marc.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.541
I think we're done here.

05:27.625 --> 05:29.708
-We're good.
-Jean-Marc, then.

05:29.791 --> 05:31.875
I'll show you the bathroom.
Want to freshen up?

05:31.958 --> 05:33.333
Sure, babe.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.416
-Yes.
-What's wrong with you?

05:36.958 --> 05:39.250
Cool it, Jean-Marc!

05:39.958 --> 05:42.666
Very funny.
A tradition on my father's side.

05:43.958 --> 05:45.291
Jean-Marc sounds good.

05:45.958 --> 05:49.375
-I think it's better than Marcus.
-Why are you here?

05:49.458 --> 05:52.375
Gate-crashing your family Christmas,
talking nonsense?

05:52.958 --> 05:55.291
-Sound familiar?
-I didn't pretend to be your man.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.666
You did try to become him though.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.458
-What game are you playing?
-I can ask you the same.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.416
Why didn't you say I'm not Mel?

06:03.500 --> 06:07.541
You don't know them!
They wouldn't get it. I don't either.

06:09.500 --> 06:11.125
-When is Mel coming over?
-Never.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.458
It's complicated.

06:16.083 --> 06:18.166
What am I going to tell them?

06:21.708 --> 06:23.000
Fuck…

06:27.041 --> 06:29.833
-Yeah?
-What are you doing?

06:29.916 --> 06:32.541
We're freezing. Did you talk to Marcus?

06:32.625 --> 06:34.041
Even better!

06:36.833 --> 06:37.666
Just a sec.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.125
It's the whole blow-drying thing.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.333
Women… What are you doing?

06:44.416 --> 06:45.708
His family thinks I'm Mel.

06:45.791 --> 06:47.875
You don't even look like her.

06:48.458 --> 06:51.500
I know. It's insane. It's totally weird.

06:51.583 --> 06:56.541
He's embarrassed. You should see his face.
I'll drag it out to piss him off.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.458
Open up. What are you doing?

06:58.541 --> 07:01.291
-Hold on. We've got to cash in on this.
-Yes.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.375
-Infiltration mission.
-What?

07:03.458 --> 07:04.916
<i>Stay in character.</i>

07:05.000 --> 07:06.833
<i>Look around his room.</i>

07:06.916 --> 07:09.208
<i>Go through his stuff. Look for clues.</i>

07:09.291 --> 07:13.083
That's where we should be looking.
His parents will give you a lead.

07:13.166 --> 07:17.000
I don't know. His family doesn't have
anything to do with it.

07:17.083 --> 07:21.458
We're not trying to expose them.
Don't forget what he tried to do to us.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.416
He wanted to play. Let's play.

07:28.208 --> 07:29.166
I'll call you back.

07:33.291 --> 07:34.125
Mel.

07:36.500 --> 07:37.416
LIFE IS BETTER WITH ME

07:37.500 --> 07:39.333
ONLY THE SUN CAN WARM ME UP

07:40.416 --> 07:41.791
I don't look like her.

08:03.708 --> 08:04.583
Yeah, okay.

08:06.916 --> 08:07.750
Shit.

08:22.291 --> 08:23.208
Hi, Mel.

08:23.958 --> 08:25.208
Thank God, finally.

08:25.291 --> 08:26.333
I have an idea.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.958
Pretend to be Mel for ten minutes or so.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.375
Act as if you received a text. Then leave.

08:35.666 --> 08:38.333
-Did you change something?
-Don't worry, babe.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.375
Everything will be fine.

08:49.958 --> 08:53.166
-Is something wrong?
-No.

08:53.250 --> 08:55.500
Tell us how you met.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.500
-We want to know everything.
-Yes, everything.

08:58.583 --> 09:00.750
-For one of my videos.
-At one of my concerts.

09:02.541 --> 09:05.791
First times are like that.
Everyone remembers it differently.

09:05.875 --> 09:07.291
Yes. Actually,

09:07.375 --> 09:09.166
Marcus is a fan of mine.

09:09.250 --> 09:11.416
He contacted me for a collab.

09:11.500 --> 09:12.666
A collab?

09:12.750 --> 09:15.166
-It's--
-She's a fan of mine, actually.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.416
-Initially.
-I don't remember that.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.250
She knows all of my songs.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.791
-Not true.
-Yes.

09:20.875 --> 09:22.333
-I'm not a fan.
-You are.

09:23.916 --> 09:26.125
The food is ready. It's time to eat.

09:27.208 --> 09:28.958
No! Let's open the presents.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.375
-Not now. We're hungry.
-Yes, we are.

09:31.458 --> 09:33.208
Yes, I'm hungry too.

09:33.291 --> 09:35.666
Come on. Get up.

09:35.750 --> 09:36.708
That's nice.

09:36.791 --> 09:40.291
Stop! You're under the mistletoe.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.208
You have to kiss.

09:45.625 --> 09:47.541
-No. It's okay.
-There's no need.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.458
-Dad's here and all.
-Come on.

09:49.541 --> 09:51.000
-Come on, bro.
-Come on.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.416
You kissed every girl
in the family as a kid.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.708
That's true.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.333
Awkward.

09:57.416 --> 10:00.250
<i>-</i>That's true, but Mel is shy.
-Yes.

10:00.333 --> 10:02.875
With all those followers of yours?
I don't believe it.

10:02.958 --> 10:06.833
-Do me a favor. My camera is waiting.
-Come on.

10:06.916 --> 10:09.541
-There's no way out.
-Come on. One kiss.

10:11.458 --> 10:13.708
I didn't have time to take a picture.

10:13.791 --> 10:15.916
Kiss for real so we can eat.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.291
Yes, do a real kiss.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.541
So we can eat.

10:20.208 --> 10:22.166
-Come on.
-Come on, bro.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.416
I've got it on camera.
I'll send it to my cousins.

10:36.500 --> 10:39.250
They don't believe me
when I say you have a fiancée.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.375
I have proof.

10:42.750 --> 10:45.041
Don't stay stuck together until next year.

10:53.791 --> 10:55.125
-Our turn.
-A kiss.

10:58.583 --> 10:59.875
Mom? Are you ready?

10:59.958 --> 11:01.166
I'm ready. Go ahead.

11:02.708 --> 11:04.541
-Did you get it?
-One more time.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.458
How about now?

11:07.541 --> 11:09.541
That one's a keeper. I'll take it.

11:12.666 --> 11:14.458
They make vegan foie gras now.

11:15.958 --> 11:18.250
-They call it faux gras.
-No.

11:18.833 --> 11:19.833
Yeah, it's not bad.

11:20.750 --> 11:23.916
Victoire buys it.
She's been into vegetarianism lately.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.333
I have to go.
Victoire and her parents are about to eat.

11:32.416 --> 11:35.333
We can't hang around here,
freezing our asses off.

11:36.583 --> 11:37.500
Okay. Let's go.

11:38.625 --> 11:39.916
Let's go. Transfer.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.458
-Drop me off?
-At your place?

11:42.541 --> 11:43.791
No, I have plans.

11:45.500 --> 11:49.333
-You're more flexible.
-You noticed. Pilates will do that.

11:50.250 --> 11:53.333
Lila can handle it.
She'll dig up some serious dirt.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.250
-Delicious.
-It's Christmas.

11:56.333 --> 11:58.208
-We're in for a treat.
-Can I help?

11:59.000 --> 12:00.750
Thanks, Mel. You're sweet.

12:00.833 --> 12:04.000
-But you're our guest. Let us handle it.
-Okay.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.250
Can I help serve, then?

12:06.333 --> 12:07.791
Weren't we right to invite you?

12:08.416 --> 12:11.875
We've been dying to meet
this famous Mel. Right, Gloria?

12:12.458 --> 12:13.458
Eagerly waiting.

12:14.583 --> 12:16.000
Me too. I…

12:16.541 --> 12:18.833
I couldn't wait to meet you.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.125
Anyway, it's…

12:25.208 --> 12:27.291
it's wonderful for Marcus,

12:27.375 --> 12:29.875
Jean-Marc, to spend Christmas with family.

12:31.208 --> 12:33.416
With the trial and everything,

12:34.000 --> 12:36.250
he's been kind of down lately.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.625
Good thing there haven't been
any further revelations.

12:44.375 --> 12:46.375
I mean, at the same time.

12:48.666 --> 12:52.416
-Like old stories, for instance…
-Poor thing. It's hard for him.

12:54.416 --> 12:57.875
It's hard for everyone.
But today is Christmas.

12:59.708 --> 13:00.791
No negative topics.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.125
Positive vibes only.

13:03.208 --> 13:05.166
Positive vibes. Yes.

13:05.250 --> 13:07.166
-Would you give me a hand?
-Yes.

13:07.250 --> 13:11.041
-It looks delicious. What is it?
-Chicken mafe. His favorite.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.541
-Of course.
-Shall we?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.833
Let's go, ladies.

13:14.458 --> 13:15.958
-After you.
-Food's ready!

13:34.125 --> 13:35.583
It's delicious, really.

13:35.666 --> 13:37.583
Thank you, Mel.

13:37.666 --> 13:42.166
The sauce with the manioc leaves.
It's called saka-saka. And we sing…

13:48.041 --> 13:50.541
-You remember?
-Of course. Are you crazy?

13:50.625 --> 13:51.916
Anyway, Mom…

13:52.583 --> 13:55.291
-This here is out of this world.
-That's right.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.958
How's your music going?

13:57.958 --> 13:59.500
Yeah, it's fine. Good.

13:59.583 --> 14:00.500
Tell us more.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.541
Nothing special.
I'm wrapping up some tracks.

14:03.625 --> 14:07.458
Do you plan on getting sued
for your next album? Or is once enough?

14:07.541 --> 14:08.458
Jean-Louis?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.166
You promised.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.041
What? I'm interested.

14:12.125 --> 14:14.666
-I'll show you interested.
-Let him be, Mom.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.666
No big deal.
Dad's right. I have to settle that.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.916
We filed an appeal.
The lawyer says it's cool.

14:23.416 --> 14:24.250
So it's cool.

14:25.416 --> 14:26.541
Yes, it's cool.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.791
We worked hard
so that our children could make it.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.583
Get a degree.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.666
So they could lead fine lives.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.083
But

14:37.625 --> 14:38.458
it's cool.

14:39.833 --> 14:43.291
-Thank goodness we have Jean-Luc.
-Dad, please.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.750
-Let's eat in peace.
-What?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.625
Can't I be proud you've become a dentist?

14:49.708 --> 14:51.333
Yes, but we're eating.

14:51.916 --> 14:55.583
I guess my diamond records
are nothing compared to Mr. Dentist.

14:58.666 --> 15:03.666
The reward of a lifetime…
is earned by the sweat of your brow.

15:04.750 --> 15:07.750
What defines us
are the values we embody and uphold.

15:07.833 --> 15:11.333
Our role in society
cannot be measured in diamond records.

15:11.416 --> 15:13.750
And even less in court convictions.

15:16.208 --> 15:19.125
-You're laying it on thick.
-I beg your pardon?

15:20.458 --> 15:22.666
Writing and composing your own songs,

15:22.750 --> 15:27.000
making millions of people dance,
dream, that counts for something.

15:27.083 --> 15:30.666
As Nietzsche said,
"Without music, life would be a mistake."

15:31.250 --> 15:33.333
I doubt he was talking about music videos

15:33.416 --> 15:36.125
packed with girls
squirming around half-naked.

15:36.208 --> 15:39.166
I agree. Talk about
the representation of women.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.166
I have to say it's a bit…

15:42.041 --> 15:44.375
-Degrading.
-To say the least.

15:45.083 --> 15:46.541
Don't get me started on the lyrics.

15:47.500 --> 15:49.125
Those lyrics are something.

15:49.208 --> 15:50.833
Is this my second trial?

15:50.916 --> 15:52.875
-I mean, Mel is right.
-All right.

15:53.916 --> 15:57.333
Are we done? Can we eat in peace?

15:58.833 --> 16:01.375
His videos aren't
the only ones where women…

16:01.458 --> 16:03.791
Just look around. They're all doing it.

16:03.875 --> 16:06.291
-It's systematic.
-I'd say it's systemic.

16:06.375 --> 16:10.083
Consider the message
it sends out to young people. Right, MJ?

16:10.791 --> 16:11.875
It's beyond that.

16:11.958 --> 16:16.833
This is about women's place in society,
in family. What's it like in yours?

16:16.916 --> 16:19.375
The men didn't set a foot
in the kitchen today.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.708
-There you go.
-More like in the last 30 years.

16:22.750 --> 16:24.333
Whatever, Mom. Come on.

16:25.291 --> 16:26.625
It's the truth.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.583
Never seen you or your brother.

16:28.666 --> 16:30.750
When we bring it up, they run away.

16:30.833 --> 16:33.791
-When did you ever lend a hand?
-I have to work!

16:33.875 --> 16:36.000
You have to work! Doesn't she work too?

16:36.083 --> 16:37.875
You do everything too fast.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.208
Thanks, Dad. That's it.

16:43.166 --> 16:44.083
<i>-Hello?</i>
-Yeah.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.041
-You holding up?
<i>-I'm fed up with Christmas.</i>

16:47.125 --> 16:49.250
I draw a line at Christmas Eve.

16:49.333 --> 16:53.125
It's like running two marathons
back to back. I'm not fit for it.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.458
<i>It's worse, Zack.</i>

16:54.541 --> 16:56.291
-Mel turned up.
<i>-Seriously?</i>

16:56.916 --> 16:59.416
<i>-Isn't that great news?</i>
-Not the right Mel.

17:00.583 --> 17:01.666
What do you mean?

17:01.750 --> 17:03.916
She's turning my Mom
into Simone de Beauvoir.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.375
<i>Hey, listen.</i>

17:06.458 --> 17:10.375
I can't have the real Mel here.
Or it'll be war. You get me?

17:12.375 --> 17:16.291
No, I didn't get that.
It doesn't look like she wants to come.

17:16.375 --> 17:19.750
I'll stay on my guard.
This is the Christmas of surprises.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.291
<i>-I'm on it.</i>
-I got to go.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.583
Hey there, sunshines!

17:24.375 --> 17:26.791
Today, we're doing Christmas meditations.

17:27.500 --> 17:30.166
To finish off the year
with positive emotions.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.166
Then we can turn off social media
until next year.

17:34.208 --> 17:35.541
Let's go.

17:35.625 --> 17:37.458
AWESOME!
SHE'S PERFECT

17:37.541 --> 17:38.708
ZACK CELLPHONE

17:38.791 --> 17:40.416
What a pain.

17:40.500 --> 17:41.875
What a fucking pain.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.041
I'm still here. Sorry.

17:45.791 --> 17:49.291
Let's get back to it.
Let's take a deep breath…

17:51.875 --> 17:54.541
Let's reach for our little wisdom box.

17:54.625 --> 17:56.125
You all know it by now.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.375
We're going to lock up our negative vibes.

18:00.125 --> 18:03.500
As well as the assholes we trusted
but shouldn't have.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.208
And we throw it away.

18:10.291 --> 18:11.541
Let's open your presents.

18:14.125 --> 18:16.291
I guess I forgot them on my way here

18:16.375 --> 18:17.666
this morning.

18:17.750 --> 18:21.666
Don't worry,
Marcus brought them. Under the tree.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.000
-Really?
-Yes, I brought them.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.166
They're under the tree.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.208
Yeah.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.250
Okay.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.416
Well, great.

18:33.458 --> 18:34.458
I'm saved.

18:38.000 --> 18:39.125
-Yeah.
-Okay. Great.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.333
We…

18:41.416 --> 18:43.375
-I'll hand them out?
-Yes, now.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.958
So…

18:48.708 --> 18:49.666
Chance.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.375
-You're too kind. Thanks.
-My pleasure.

18:53.916 --> 18:55.166
Next…

18:55.750 --> 18:57.291
Gloria. We have two for you.

18:57.375 --> 18:58.208
Thank you.

19:00.375 --> 19:01.583
You're spoiled.

19:03.083 --> 19:04.750
-Jean-Luc.
-Thank you.

19:05.541 --> 19:07.041
And Jean-Louis.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.541
-Thanks.
-There.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.708
The last one for MJ.

19:12.458 --> 19:15.666
-I'm spoiled this year.
-Merry Christmas!

19:15.750 --> 19:16.625
Thanks, Mel!

19:21.625 --> 19:22.458
Thanks, Mel.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.375
It's a fucking sex toy.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.791
It's beautiful. What is it?

19:29.875 --> 19:31.375
I don't know.

19:32.666 --> 19:34.250
I got a candle.

19:34.958 --> 19:36.791
It smells lovely.

19:42.583 --> 19:43.416
Tell me, son.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.833
-What does it mean?
-It smells like muff.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.708
-Like what?
-Pussy.

19:49.333 --> 19:50.791
-Vagina.
-MJ.

19:51.541 --> 19:52.375
There!

19:53.333 --> 19:55.291
-I got it. Easy.
-No…

19:55.958 --> 19:58.125
-It's a Bluetooth earbud.
-No.

19:58.208 --> 20:00.208
-It is!
-"Voucher for a makeover."

20:00.291 --> 20:04.000
"Men have a right to be sexy too."

20:04.083 --> 20:06.166
-I totally agree.
-Yes…

20:06.833 --> 20:09.250
"From your legs to your chest, eyebrows,

20:09.333 --> 20:11.916
back, and the cleftal horizon"?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.875
"Cleftal horizon"? What's that?

20:13.958 --> 20:15.458
Mommy will look it up.

20:15.541 --> 20:17.458
I'll tell you what it means.

20:18.541 --> 20:20.458
"Buttock cleavage."

20:21.458 --> 20:22.541
All right. I see.

20:24.083 --> 20:24.958
Hair removal.

20:26.458 --> 20:27.416
Here, Mom.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.666
You have one left.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.083
-Another candle.
-Well!

20:31.750 --> 20:33.333
I have a collective present.

20:33.416 --> 20:34.833
-Yeah!
-Really?

20:37.083 --> 20:37.916
Listen.

20:39.791 --> 20:41.208
A Christmas carol.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.541
-How cute.
-It's cute.

20:48.500 --> 20:50.958
<i>One, two three, MJ's in the house</i>

20:51.041 --> 20:53.833
<i>I, too, can rap, so I'm the next star</i>

20:53.916 --> 20:56.458
<i>This year, I'm Santa Claus</i>
<i>I'll grant all your wishes</i>

20:56.541 --> 20:58.750
<i>Mom, Dad, I can't help</i>
<i>If the bedroom's dead</i>

20:58.833 --> 21:01.291
<i>Jean-Luc, who you laughing at?</i>

21:01.375 --> 21:03.750
<i>Put down your spoon, you've gotten fat</i>

21:03.833 --> 21:06.375
<i>Shut it, I'm in charge</i>
<i>It's nonsense</i>

21:06.458 --> 21:08.916
<i>You, big brother, put a lid on it</i>

21:09.000 --> 21:11.166
<i>Sir Marcus, blinded by ambition</i>

21:11.250 --> 21:13.875
<i>Play it tough</i>
<i>When shit goes down, you play dead</i>

21:13.958 --> 21:16.375
<i>When Verno calls</i>
<i>You're on airplane mode</i>

21:16.458 --> 21:18.750
<i>Easy to be a champ</i>
<i>When you pick your fights</i>

21:25.250 --> 21:26.916
Way to go, MJ!

21:27.000 --> 21:28.125
My God…

21:28.208 --> 21:30.250
-I love it. It's great.
-Thanks.

21:30.333 --> 21:33.208
-Why would you say such horrible things?
-What?

21:33.291 --> 21:35.875
-Are you out of your mind?
-It's a reply to Verno.

21:35.958 --> 21:37.291
What about Verno?

21:37.375 --> 21:39.541
-You know him?
-I won't stand it.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.333
-You stop that.
-Why don't you say anything?

21:43.666 --> 21:45.458
I wrote it for you!

21:45.541 --> 21:48.250
-Don't you like it?
-It's not that, MJ, but--

21:48.333 --> 21:50.416
Isn't it enough
to bring shame on our family?

21:50.958 --> 21:52.666
Why drag your sister into it?

21:53.375 --> 21:55.458
Do you want her to end up in court?

21:56.458 --> 21:58.541
Whatever happens, it's my fault.

22:03.416 --> 22:06.416
You know what, Dad?
Keep your comments to yourself.

22:08.375 --> 22:10.541
I hate Christmas.
With you, it's even worse.

22:10.625 --> 22:13.291
Aren't you sick of pretending?
This is a mess.

22:13.375 --> 22:15.875
MJ. Do me a favor. Stop rapping.

22:16.500 --> 22:18.125
-It's not for chicks.
-What?

22:18.208 --> 22:21.291
Bro, your wife's present
is a fucking sex toy. Yeah.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.291
-I need a cig.
-You smoke now?

22:27.083 --> 22:27.916
Excuse me.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.458
-A sex toy?
-What does it do?

22:32.541 --> 22:33.375
Good question.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.458
Girls…

22:41.125 --> 22:43.166
-Where you at?
-I don't know.

22:43.250 --> 22:47.083
Between the family melodrama
and orgasm candles, it's a roller coaster.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.916
Sounds like a blast.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.291
-Totally.
<i>-Did you dig up some dirt?</i>

22:51.375 --> 22:53.500
-I'm ready to write.
<i>-Nothing at all.</i>

22:53.583 --> 22:54.500
Seriously?

22:54.583 --> 22:57.791
-I'm wiped out. I've had enough.
-Are you still a journalist?

22:58.458 --> 22:59.500
-Yes.
<i>-Then dig.</i>

22:59.583 --> 23:02.041
Ask questions, investigate. Do your job.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.083
He has to have some secret vice.

23:04.166 --> 23:06.375
-Obviously.
-All right.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.458
Okay.

23:52.791 --> 23:55.625
The kid in the picture
next to Marcus is Verno.

23:55.708 --> 23:58.541
The guy trashing him on Insta.
They were friends.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.500
Childhood friends.

24:13.208 --> 24:14.333
What are you doing?

24:15.625 --> 24:16.458
You scared me.

24:17.458 --> 24:20.125
-I'm not doing anything.
-Nothing?

24:20.208 --> 24:23.041
-Then I'll call Marcus.
-No!

24:24.916 --> 24:28.291
I'm busy preparing
a surprise birthday party.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.333
I'm going to make him a video.

24:30.416 --> 24:31.791
You're ruining it.

24:31.875 --> 24:33.625
-A video?
-Yes.

24:34.333 --> 24:37.750
You really think I'm stupid?
I know you're not Mel.

24:37.833 --> 24:40.000
-It's not even you on Insta.
-It is.

24:40.625 --> 24:41.708
It's me on Insta.

24:43.041 --> 24:45.458
I use filters that alter my face.

24:45.541 --> 24:47.375
-It's me.
-Filters?

24:48.333 --> 24:49.291
What do you want?

24:51.000 --> 24:52.041
Make an offer.

24:53.000 --> 24:55.208
-Do you want candy?
-Candy?

24:55.291 --> 24:56.583
That's a pedo move.

24:57.708 --> 24:59.750
I want cash. Give me 20 euros.

25:01.541 --> 25:02.375
Come on.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.500
-Got change for a 50?
-What am I, a supermarket?

25:09.708 --> 25:11.625
-That's extortion.
-Hey…

25:12.500 --> 25:15.000
Tell me what went down with Verno.

25:15.083 --> 25:16.500
There's nothing to tell.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.666
He's bashing my brother on Insta.
Marcus just rolls over.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.583
Shame on him.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.541
Weren't they childhood friends?

25:24.625 --> 25:27.583
Verno says
Marcus was out of line with Salomé.

25:27.666 --> 25:28.750
He's just jealous.

25:30.125 --> 25:31.333
-Salomé?
-Yeah.

25:32.166 --> 25:33.000
Okay.

25:33.833 --> 25:38.291
-Out of line? What did he do?
-That's it for 50 bucks.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.125
I'm cleaned out. I'll pay you later.

25:41.208 --> 25:42.625
I don't give out credit.

25:43.666 --> 25:44.500
She's insane.

25:46.166 --> 25:47.625
Fifty bucks. Not bad.

25:50.875 --> 25:52.666
This family is just…

26:04.125 --> 26:07.375
I have a lead.
A Salomé, with whom something happened.

26:07.458 --> 26:09.250
He and Verno got into a fight.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.833
We have to find her. She might talk to us.

26:12.458 --> 26:13.375
I'll look into it.

26:15.625 --> 26:18.125
-Where are you going?
-To defend my brother's honor.

26:18.750 --> 26:21.291
-Who was that?
-His sister.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.875
-She's not messing around.
-You don't say.

26:23.958 --> 26:25.583
What do we do?

26:26.583 --> 26:28.208
I have a source.

26:32.208 --> 26:33.041
Hello.

26:34.583 --> 26:35.416
Alice!

26:35.500 --> 26:36.333
Yeah.

26:38.291 --> 26:40.416
-How are you?
-Fine. You?

26:40.500 --> 26:42.666
-I wasn't expecting you.
-I can tell.

26:44.291 --> 26:45.916
-Can I come in?
-Here?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.291
-Yes.
-For sure. Make yourself at home.

26:48.375 --> 26:50.708
I guess music pays well.

26:50.791 --> 26:51.875
Yeah. Very well.

26:54.583 --> 26:55.541
Want some cereal?

26:57.333 --> 26:59.208
See? I'm cleaning the table.

27:00.083 --> 27:01.083
I'll go get her.

27:03.458 --> 27:04.833
Yo. Have you seen MJ?

27:05.916 --> 27:08.458
She went to defend your honor.

27:08.541 --> 27:09.458
What?

27:10.291 --> 27:13.000
-At Verno's?
-She wants to get your attention.

27:13.875 --> 27:17.000
Support her.
Don't hold her back because she's a girl.

27:17.083 --> 27:20.500
-She's going to stir up trouble.
-She's not going to fight.

27:21.083 --> 27:21.958
No.

27:22.041 --> 27:24.416
She wrecked up a guy from middle school.

27:25.083 --> 27:26.708
-You serious?
-I have to go.

27:27.541 --> 27:29.041
I'm coming with you.

27:29.666 --> 27:31.458
Wait!

27:33.208 --> 27:34.041
There.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.541
Here we are. Thank you all for tuning in.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.500
I wish you all happy holidays.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.083
And goodbye to social media.

27:45.416 --> 27:46.875
See you next year.

27:47.541 --> 27:49.333
POOR MEL
TRAITOR

27:49.416 --> 27:51.000
IT'S SO SAD FOR YOU MEL

27:51.083 --> 27:51.916
Bye.

27:53.583 --> 27:54.416
No.

27:56.541 --> 27:58.416
No.

27:59.291 --> 28:00.791
Mel, don't do this.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.791
TAGGED YOU IN A STORY
73 PEOPLE SENT YOU A MESSAGE

28:03.875 --> 28:04.708
Wisdom.

28:04.791 --> 28:06.916
JADE - MEL ANSWER ME PLZ
CALL MARCUS

28:07.000 --> 28:08.458
YOU OKAY? SAW THE PHOTO

28:09.958 --> 28:10.958
DID YOU SEE THIS?

28:11.583 --> 28:12.416
It's weird.

28:12.958 --> 28:14.833
Only my cousins followed me.

28:14.916 --> 28:16.208
Now I have 250.

28:16.291 --> 28:20.541
-That's lit.
-Marcus has a new girl!

28:20.625 --> 28:21.958
No, 523!

28:24.375 --> 28:25.250
1,075?

28:27.583 --> 28:28.666
They hooked up!

28:30.500 --> 28:32.291
Dammit, he can't help himself.

28:32.375 --> 28:33.708
I see 2,500.

28:33.791 --> 28:35.500
My aunt's dating Marcus!

28:37.625 --> 28:38.458
What?

28:40.875 --> 28:42.166
When does it stop?

28:42.250 --> 28:44.125
Mom, it doesn't stop.

28:46.083 --> 28:47.291
MOM CHECK THIS OUT!

28:48.625 --> 28:50.000
There we go. The kiss.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.708
You're up to 3,000.

28:55.791 --> 28:56.666
So…

28:57.250 --> 28:58.083
I know.

28:59.083 --> 29:03.666
A relationship isn't a bed of roses.
You have to hang in there.

29:05.083 --> 29:05.916
I'm launching

29:06.833 --> 29:07.666
the hashtag

29:08.708 --> 29:10.416
"Mel and Marcus challenge."

29:11.166 --> 29:12.291
WE'RE HERE FOR YOU
BE BRAVE

29:12.375 --> 29:14.333
Post our most beautiful pictures

29:15.166 --> 29:17.083
and send him lots of love.

29:17.166 --> 29:19.583
Remind him we're meant for each other.

29:19.666 --> 29:20.625
YOU'LL BE OKAY
SUPPORT

29:22.791 --> 29:23.625
Asshole.

29:26.250 --> 29:28.541
-Wait. Hold on.
-What?

29:28.625 --> 29:29.583
Okay. I get it.

29:29.666 --> 29:30.500
Easy.

29:31.791 --> 29:34.333
No, I mean, let's get to know each other.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.083
-Okay. I get it.
-Let's ask each other questions.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.250
-Yeah.
-I'll start.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.416
For how long have you known Marcus?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.125
Easy. Since middle school.

29:43.208 --> 29:44.041
My turn?

29:45.958 --> 29:47.875
Your favorite Marvel superhero?

29:48.875 --> 29:50.291
That's a lousy question.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.666
No judgment, otherwise--

29:52.750 --> 29:54.375
Don't worry. My turn again.

29:54.458 --> 29:57.500
Have you known Verno
since middle school too?

29:58.791 --> 30:00.333
You know about Verno?

30:00.916 --> 30:02.416
His videos. Online.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.250
Like everyone else.

30:04.333 --> 30:06.416
How did you know we were friends?

30:07.583 --> 30:10.541
Because he says so at some point.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.500
-He says it?
-He says so, yeah.

30:12.583 --> 30:14.791
-Hold on. I don't think so.
-He does.

30:14.875 --> 30:16.500
-Let me check.
-Who cares?

30:21.041 --> 30:21.875
Sorry.

30:22.791 --> 30:23.625
Wait.

30:24.416 --> 30:27.708
Didn't you and Verno
used to be best pals? What happened?

30:27.791 --> 30:28.625
I'll explain.

30:51.250 --> 30:52.208
Hi. How are you?

30:52.291 --> 30:55.541
I don't have much time.
I'm looking for my sister, MJ.

30:55.625 --> 30:57.125
No. MJ, my little sister.

31:01.000 --> 31:04.250
Go to the living room.
Okay? Thanks, Grandma.

31:04.875 --> 31:08.500
-What the fuck are you doing here?
-I'm looking for my sister.

31:09.291 --> 31:11.625
Look somewhere else. Or you'll find me.

31:12.208 --> 31:14.666
-Still got that big mouth of yours.
-What?

31:14.750 --> 31:17.208
You come here, disrespect me. Wanna die?

31:18.958 --> 31:21.416
Chill out. What's with the cockfight?

31:21.500 --> 31:23.791
Your grandma's in the next room.

31:23.875 --> 31:25.041
Who are you anyway?

31:26.541 --> 31:28.416
I'm a friend of Marcus.

31:29.875 --> 31:31.666
Listen. We're looking for MJ.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.250
You can see she isn't here.

31:35.666 --> 31:37.291
Maybe she's with Mehdi.

31:37.833 --> 31:39.791
-Who's Mehdi?
-His little brother.

31:40.375 --> 31:41.208
Yeah.

31:41.291 --> 31:43.291
She showed up at his school.

31:43.958 --> 31:46.833
They diss each other.
Get into fights on our account.

31:47.416 --> 31:49.708
They were suspended.
Don't you know anything?

31:53.458 --> 31:54.458
Where are they?

31:55.666 --> 31:57.333
Your buddy has forgotten.

31:59.250 --> 32:00.583
Where did we hang out?

32:06.000 --> 32:09.333
#MELANDMARCUSCHALLENGE

32:09.416 --> 32:10.250
Beautiful.

32:12.458 --> 32:15.125
You guys are amazing. All right?

32:15.208 --> 32:16.666
Keep it up. I have to…

32:16.750 --> 32:18.541
I have to go get him back.

32:18.625 --> 32:22.541
I'm on my way to his place.
Stay tuned. I'm taking you with me.

32:22.625 --> 32:23.833
They're perfect.

32:23.916 --> 32:25.708
Come on. Let's go.

32:30.208 --> 32:31.166
Come on.

32:34.166 --> 32:35.875
YOUTH CULTURAL CENTER

32:39.250 --> 32:40.250
They're upstairs.

32:42.916 --> 32:44.916
<i>You got nothing to say</i>

32:45.000 --> 32:47.625
<i>Your brother makes more dough</i>
<i>But Verno's dope</i>

32:47.708 --> 32:50.208
<i>One slap sends you to Bali</i>
<i>No, I don't hit girls</i>

32:50.291 --> 32:53.375
<i>Got something to say?</i>
<i>Open your mouth, I dare you</i>

32:58.250 --> 33:00.541
<i>Why bring up my brother?</i>
<i>This is me against you</i>

33:00.625 --> 33:03.541
<i>Me up here, you down there</i>
<i>A failure, a star</i>

33:03.625 --> 33:05.875
<i>I'm the best</i>
<i>You want to argue?</i>

33:05.958 --> 33:08.833
<i>You're gonna be eating dirt</i>
<i>Down in the dumps</i>

33:12.458 --> 33:13.958
She's kicking his ass.

33:14.041 --> 33:15.666
-Marcus is there!
-No way!

33:15.750 --> 33:17.500
-Marcus, come rap!
-Marcus!

33:25.666 --> 33:26.583
Who's Salomé?

33:27.166 --> 33:28.875
-Salomé who?
-You know who I mean.

33:28.958 --> 33:31.416
I'm not like that. There's no one else.

33:31.500 --> 33:34.041
Salomé from Marcus and Verno.
What's the deal?

33:34.125 --> 33:37.041
Hold on.
You want to get to know me or Marcus?

33:37.125 --> 33:40.125
I'd like to know
if you're guys who mess with girls.

33:40.208 --> 33:41.875
What? That's not it at all.

33:44.083 --> 33:45.708
Go on, then. I'm listening.

33:46.375 --> 33:48.541
Something happened with Salomé.

33:48.625 --> 33:49.458
I knew it.

33:51.083 --> 33:52.041
It's not a girl.

33:53.208 --> 33:54.041
It's a guy?

33:55.625 --> 33:56.458
No.

33:57.125 --> 33:58.083
What is it?

33:58.166 --> 33:59.166
Marcus!

33:59.250 --> 34:00.791
All right. I'm in.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.750
I want a worthy opponent.

34:04.541 --> 34:06.666
Verno!

34:08.750 --> 34:09.750
Come on.

34:09.833 --> 34:10.666
Let's go!

34:11.291 --> 34:12.375
Let's honor Salomé.

34:12.458 --> 34:14.458
Salomé!

34:16.291 --> 34:17.375
All right. Enough.

34:17.958 --> 34:19.000
You've had your fun.

34:19.083 --> 34:22.791
Put the equipment
back in the studio. Turn the lights off.

34:22.875 --> 34:24.500
-And you, Mehdi.
-What?

34:24.583 --> 34:25.416
Go home.

34:26.250 --> 34:27.750
-Hurry up.
-A pain in the…

34:31.708 --> 34:34.291
You're a major pain.
I was kicking his ass!

34:34.375 --> 34:36.750
Mom's gonna be kicking your ass. Shut it.

34:37.750 --> 34:38.750
Go home. Move it!

34:45.125 --> 34:45.958
Who's Salomé?

34:47.458 --> 34:48.625
Verno's sister?

34:48.708 --> 34:50.125
His ex? Your ex?

34:50.708 --> 34:51.541
What?

34:52.458 --> 34:55.916
What's the deal?
You were together? You treated her badly?

34:57.375 --> 34:58.708
Who do you think I am?

35:00.208 --> 35:02.333
A son of a bitch who beats up women?

35:02.416 --> 35:03.541
You tell me.

35:14.250 --> 35:15.166
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

35:15.250 --> 35:16.125
It's a track.

35:16.791 --> 35:18.375
"Salomé" is a song.

35:18.458 --> 35:20.166
<i>Verno says Marcus ripped it off him.</i>

35:20.250 --> 35:21.541
<i>-Got to go.</i>
-Shit…

35:21.625 --> 35:25.333
What a moron. Shit!

35:28.500 --> 35:30.625
WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING ON INSTA?

35:34.875 --> 35:35.750
Shit.

35:38.375 --> 35:39.416
DEAL WITH IT!!!

35:39.500 --> 35:40.375
Shit.

35:43.958 --> 35:46.250
-What a great view.
-I know. I'm sorry.

35:46.333 --> 35:48.083
Got to bounce. An emergency.

35:48.166 --> 35:50.666
-Close the door?
-We don't know each other.

35:50.750 --> 35:52.666
Don't worry. It's fine.

35:52.750 --> 35:56.791
You can steal, set the place on fire
as long as you see me again.

36:30.833 --> 36:31.791
What are you doing?

36:32.708 --> 36:35.708
A wise one once said
you should go high for perspective.

36:35.791 --> 36:36.875
You should try it.

36:39.125 --> 36:39.958
Okay.

36:40.833 --> 36:41.708
I messed up.

36:42.416 --> 36:44.500
-I admit it.
-You came to apologize?

36:45.083 --> 36:46.291
Why would I?

36:47.541 --> 36:49.916
Don't wanna be taken for an ass?
Don't talk crap.

36:50.000 --> 36:53.333
Why didn't you ask? I'd have told you.

36:55.250 --> 36:57.166
Let's hear it. Since we're here.

36:58.875 --> 36:59.708
Too late.

37:05.750 --> 37:06.708
How about a bet?

37:08.583 --> 37:09.916
Let's bet our stories.

37:10.541 --> 37:11.750
Let's play for them.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.000
Play for them? In what game?

37:18.625 --> 37:20.916
Okay. Missed. Tell me the Verno story.

37:21.916 --> 37:22.750
Okay.

37:23.666 --> 37:27.333
Verno and I used to be brothers.
We made music together.

37:27.416 --> 37:29.875
We wrote a song called "Salomé."
The hood loved it.

37:30.750 --> 37:34.000
I tried to strike a deal
with a record label.

37:34.708 --> 37:36.208
Along comes Pascal.

37:36.708 --> 37:41.125
He was willing to produce,
but he wanted a more provocative image.

37:41.833 --> 37:42.666
Provocative?

37:43.291 --> 37:46.250
I was all in. I agreed.
I wanted us to make it big.

37:47.041 --> 37:50.208
Verno didn't see it that way.
So we clashed.

37:50.791 --> 37:52.666
"Salomé" became "The Hourglass."

37:53.458 --> 37:55.125
Jean-Marc became Marcus.

37:56.291 --> 37:57.416
Verno stayed Verno.

37:58.333 --> 37:59.166
The end.

37:59.250 --> 38:02.291
-Don't get carried away. It's nothing.
<i>-You kidding?</i>

38:02.375 --> 38:05.250
Some chick kissed my man
in front of the world.

38:05.333 --> 38:07.208
-I shouldn't get carried away?
-Misunderstanding.

38:07.291 --> 38:09.833
Let's meet, have coffee,
and talk it through.

38:09.916 --> 38:13.041
<i>I'm on my way</i>
<i>to Marcus' parents' as we speak.</i>

38:14.125 --> 38:16.375
Where are you? I'll come pick you up.

38:16.458 --> 38:19.416
The whole community's behind me.
I don't need you.

38:20.541 --> 38:21.791
He's pissing me off.

38:22.458 --> 38:24.541
Tell me your biggest secret.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.416
No. It's too big.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.833
Unless you get to the top before me.

38:28.916 --> 38:31.416
-Your most awkward date?
-With a guy?

38:31.500 --> 38:34.250
That sucks, but it doesn't count. Cheater.

38:36.041 --> 38:36.916
No.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.083
Move over. No way.

38:40.708 --> 38:41.833
-Missed.
-Fuck.

38:41.916 --> 38:43.416
Something more cheerful.

38:45.500 --> 38:48.083
When was the last time you felt free?

38:48.166 --> 38:50.958
Have you seen my trials
and interview? I'm free.

38:52.583 --> 38:54.375
I didn't say free to say bullshit.

38:55.416 --> 38:56.958
Just free.

38:59.333 --> 39:00.458
That's not so easy.

39:02.458 --> 39:03.875
I have responsibilities.

39:05.916 --> 39:07.958
People expect too much from me.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.041
Fans, the media, journalists.

39:10.125 --> 39:11.625
-Family.
-Family, yeah.

39:14.208 --> 39:16.791
Everyone has a set image of who I am.

39:17.750 --> 39:18.750
It freaks me out.

39:22.333 --> 39:25.625
It's the life I've chosen.
I have to own up to it.

39:26.500 --> 39:27.875
I feel free right now.

39:28.583 --> 39:30.500
Not sure if it's because of you…

39:32.500 --> 39:34.291
-Let's hope it lasts.
-Yeah.

39:34.375 --> 39:35.666
-My turn now.
-I know.

39:35.750 --> 39:36.791
What are you doing?

39:38.708 --> 39:40.458
Not fair. It was my turn.

39:40.541 --> 39:41.958
That's freedom.

39:42.625 --> 39:44.166
That's cheating, my friend.

39:46.500 --> 39:47.333
Tell me

39:48.583 --> 39:49.416
your

39:50.208 --> 39:51.250
biggest secret.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.833
-Is that how it is?
-Yeah.

40:01.166 --> 40:03.666
My mom told you my dad left
one Christmas without warning.

40:05.416 --> 40:06.250
It's not true.

40:08.041 --> 40:08.875
Well, it is.

40:12.000 --> 40:12.916
He told me.

40:13.833 --> 40:14.708
Just me.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.500
I was little.
I wanted to protect my mom, my sister.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.416
I said nothing.

40:23.375 --> 40:24.708
A week later, he left.

40:30.666 --> 40:33.416
I still keep it to myself
because it's too late.

40:38.416 --> 40:39.750
They still don't know.

40:52.166 --> 40:53.000
Thanks.

41:05.250 --> 41:06.833
Mel! Wait!

41:06.916 --> 41:09.041
-Are you stalking me?
-Not at all.

41:09.750 --> 41:11.625
-No use showing up.
-I'm busy.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.083
Not a good idea while it's still raw.

41:14.166 --> 41:16.708
-You're going to fight.
-We love each other.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.958
-Let's talk.
-We love each other.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.208
-Let me go!
-Zack?

41:20.875 --> 41:21.875
Auntie.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.333
-Is that you?
-You okay?

41:23.416 --> 41:25.458
-What are you doing here?
-Well…

41:25.541 --> 41:28.000
-Strolling around the neighborhood.
-Hi.

41:28.083 --> 41:29.291
-And you are?
-Mel.

41:30.666 --> 41:32.291
-It's Mel.
-Which "Mel"?

41:33.333 --> 41:34.333
What do you mean?

41:34.416 --> 41:36.750
Do you often steal people's identities?

41:37.791 --> 41:39.000
I'm not the bad guy.

41:39.666 --> 41:42.583
You tried to buy us behind our backs.

41:44.750 --> 41:45.583
That's right.

41:46.833 --> 41:48.250
I have to make a call.

41:48.833 --> 41:51.333
-Should I wait for you?
-Go ahead. It's fine.

41:52.500 --> 41:53.333
Okay. I'm off.

42:01.333 --> 42:04.250
<i>Listen. Forget it.</i>
<i>"Salomé" is just a song.</i>

42:04.333 --> 42:05.708
I know. Alice told me.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.458
That's good too.

42:08.000 --> 42:12.500
-I edited the article. Added plagiarism.
-That's not what we agreed on.

42:12.583 --> 42:14.416
-It's not the point.
<i>-Now it is.</i>

42:14.500 --> 42:18.708
Do we not want to bring him down?
Everything is true. Relax.

42:18.791 --> 42:20.000
<i>Maybe it is.</i>

42:20.083 --> 42:22.625
The Simones don't do
gossip and copyrights.

42:22.708 --> 42:25.458
We don't have time for those questions.

42:25.541 --> 42:27.708
Did he mind when it came to us? No.

42:27.791 --> 42:30.041
Because he knows that everything goes.

42:30.125 --> 42:31.958
So we're publishing it now.

42:32.625 --> 42:34.541
No, I don't agree.

42:34.625 --> 42:37.041
Not this time. End of discussion.

42:39.583 --> 42:40.416
Fuck…

42:47.375 --> 42:49.750
-Are you almost done?
-I'm coming.

42:54.416 --> 42:55.250
Okay.

43:01.083 --> 43:01.916
Shit.

43:18.250 --> 43:19.750
THE SIMONES JUST POSTED A VIDEO

43:22.125 --> 43:26.041
CHRISTMAS WITH MARCUS,
PLAGIARISM AND MISOGYNY - HATS OFF!

43:26.125 --> 43:26.958
Fuck…

43:34.375 --> 43:35.875
-There you are.
-There's--

43:35.958 --> 43:37.625
I'm sorry about earlier.

43:38.416 --> 43:39.541
You nailed it.

43:40.125 --> 43:41.333
You were right there!

43:41.416 --> 43:43.750
Your flow, your lyrics. And Jean-Luc.

43:43.833 --> 43:46.000
I'm going to tell the parents.

43:46.083 --> 43:47.750
-Hold on.
-They have to hear this.

43:47.833 --> 43:48.833
Marcus, hold on!

43:49.416 --> 43:51.375
Dad? We have to talk.

43:51.458 --> 43:53.666
Indeed. You have things to explain.

43:55.333 --> 43:57.541
Who just spent Christmas in our home?

43:59.625 --> 44:02.208
Probably the one who wrote this.

44:03.625 --> 44:06.583
"Christmas with Marcus.
Plagiarism and misogyny."

44:06.666 --> 44:07.791
"Hats off!"

44:07.875 --> 44:09.458
How about that… Yeah.

44:10.583 --> 44:14.541
-Well done.
-With her vagina-scented candle.

44:14.625 --> 44:15.916
You opened the gifts?

44:18.625 --> 44:19.583
Okay. All right.

44:20.583 --> 44:23.250
-I can explain everything.
-You can try, yeah.

44:24.791 --> 44:27.208
I, for one, need a good explanation!

44:27.291 --> 44:29.833
How could you do this to your mother?
