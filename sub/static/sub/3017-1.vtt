- Permission to speak candidly, sir?
- Granted.

SAAVIK: I don't believe this was
a fair test of my command abilities.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.588
- And why not?
- Because there was no way to win.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.509
A no-win situation is a possibility
every commander may face.

- No, sir. It has not.

as important as how we deal with life,

07:15.852 --> 07:17.519

that thought had not occurred to me.

19:24.912 --> 19:27.080
What do you want with us?
Sir, I demand to be...

19:27.164 --> 19:30.125
You are in a position
to demand nothing, sir.

19:33.045 --> 19:37.924
I, on the other hand,
am in a position to grant nothing.

19:39.260 --> 19:43.138
What you see is all that remains
of the ship's company and crew

19:43.598 --> 19:45.265
of the Botany Bay,

19:45.808 --> 19:51.396
marooned here 15 years ago
by Captain James T. Kirk.

19:51.564 --> 19:55.150
- Listen to me. You men and women...
- Captain, Captain, Captain.

19:57.361 --> 19:59.237
(KHAN CHUCKLING)

19:59.322 --> 20:01.489
Save your strength, Captain.

20:03.117 --> 20:04.659
These people have sworn

20:04.744 --> 20:09.289
to live and die at my command
200 years before you were born.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.835
Do you mean he never told you the tale?

20:15.922 --> 20:17.964
To amuse your captain? No?

20:21.093 --> 20:24.095
Never told you how the Enterprise
picked up the Botany Bay,

20:24.180 --> 20:27.265
lost in space from the year 1996,

20:27.350 --> 20:31.394
myself and the ship's company
in cryogenic freeze?

20:31.479 --> 20:34.356
- I've never even met Admiral Kirk.
- KHAN: Admiral?

20:35.358 --> 20:36.608
Admiral.

20:37.985 --> 20:39.319
Admiral.

20:44.033 --> 20:47.369
Never told you how Admiral Kirk

20:48.454 --> 20:53.667
sent 70 of us into exile
on this barren sand heap,

20:53.918 --> 20:58.505
with only the contents
of these cargo bays to sustain us?

20:58.839 --> 21:02.050
You lie! On Ceti Alpha V there was life!

21:02.510 --> 21:05.428
- A fair chance.
- This is Ceti Alpha V.

21:14.480 --> 21:20.610
Ceti Alpha VI exploded six months
after we were left here.

21:21.862 --> 21:26.282
The shock shifted the orbit of this planet
and everything was laid waste.

21:28.077 --> 21:32.455
Admiral Kirk never bothered
to check on our progress.

21:37.461 --> 21:41.172
It was only the fact
of my genetically engineered intellect

21:41.716 --> 21:43.800
that allowed us to survive.

21:48.597 --> 21:49.848
On Earth,

21:52.518 --> 21:54.019
two hundred years ago,

21:56.022 --> 21:57.564
I was a prince

21:59.984 --> 22:01.985
with power over millions.

22:02.611 --> 22:04.696
Captain Kirk was your host.

22:05.239 --> 22:09.492
You repaid his hospitality by trying
to steal his ship and murder him.

22:20.880 --> 22:27.635
You didn't expect to find me.
You thought this was Ceti Alpha VI.

22:30.139 --> 22:31.514
Ah.

22:33.225 --> 22:34.559
Why are you here?

22:44.570 --> 22:45.653

22:53.496 --> 22:56.247

to Ceti Alpha V's

23:20.106 --> 23:22.107
including my beloved wife.

23:37.915 --> 23:39.707

23:55.015 --> 23:56.015
(BARKING)

23:59.270 --> 24:03.606
You see, their young
enter through the ears

24:05.192 --> 24:08.236
and wrap themselves
around the cerebral cortex.

24:08.946 --> 24:10.822
This has the effect
of rendering the victim

24:10.906 --> 24:14.450
extremely susceptible to suggestion.

24:16.912 --> 24:20.165
Later, as they grow,

24:22.459 --> 24:27.255

26:13.112 --> 26:16.531
I'm delighted.
Any chance to go aboard the Enterprise.

26:26.083 --> 26:29.419
Well, I, for one, am glad to have you
at the helm for three weeks.

Open the airlock.

26:51.442 --> 26:53.693
- Permission to come aboard, Captain.
- Welcome, Admiral.

26:53.777 --> 26:57.697
I think you know my training crew.
Certainly they have come to know you.

26:57.781 --> 27:00.908
Yes. We've been through
death and life together.

27:06.081 --> 27:08.708
Mr. Scott, you old space dog.
You're well?

27:08.792 --> 27:12.170
I had a wee bout, sir,
but Dr. McCoy pulled me through.

27:12.254 --> 27:14.964
- A wee bout of what?
- Shore leave, Admiral.

27:15.049 --> 27:16.257
Oh, yes.

27:19.178 --> 27:20.511
And who do we have here?

27:20.596 --> 27:24.015
Midshipman, first class,
Peter Preston, engineer's mate, sir!

27:24.099 --> 27:25.641
First training voyage, Mr. Preston?

27:25.726 --> 27:28.311
- Yes, sir!
- I see.

27:29.605 --> 27:32.857
Well, shall we start
with the Engine Room?

27:32.941 --> 27:35.276
SCOTTY: We'll see you there, sir.
And everything is in order.

27:35.361 --> 27:37.653
That'll be a pleasant surprise, Mr. Scott.

27:38.947 --> 27:43.034
I'll see you on the Bridge, Admiral.

everything shipshape, Admiral.

28:39.716 --> 28:40.716
Oh, do you?

28:42.385 --> 28:44.178
Do you have any idea,
Midshipman Preston,

28:44.262 --> 28:46.680
how many times I've had to listen
to Mr. Scott on the comm,

28:46.765 --> 28:48.307
telling me his trouble?

28:48.391 --> 28:51.977
Do you have any idea, the ribbing
I've had to endure in the officer's mess,

28:52.062 --> 28:55.564
to the effect that
the Enterprise is a flying deathtrap?

28:55.899 --> 28:56.899
Oh, no, sir.

28:57.901 --> 29:01.403
This is the finest engine room
in the whole Starfleet.

29:01.488 --> 29:03.072
If the Admiral
can't see the facts for himself,

29:03.156 --> 29:05.407
then, with all due respect,

29:05.492 --> 29:07.659
he is as blind as a Tiberian bat.

Crazy to get to space.

I seem to remember it myself.

Well, Mr. Scott, are your engines

29:25.011 --> 29:27.388
capable of handling
a minor training cruise?

29:27.472 --> 29:31.809
- Give the word, Admiral.
- Mr. Scott, the word is given.

29:31.893 --> 29:33.102
Aye, sir.

- Thank you.

30:28.241 --> 30:31.451
Have you ever piloted a starship
out of space dock?

Never, sir.

30:43.256 --> 30:45.215
Take her out, Mr. Saavik.

Aye, sir.

For everything,
there is a first time, Lieutenant.

31:00.648 --> 31:01.815
Don't you agree, Admiral?

31:01.899 --> 31:02.941

31:03.025 --> 31:05.736
- Aft thrusters, Mr. Sulu.
- SULU: Aft thrusters.

Would you like a tranquillizer?

- Captain's discretion.
- Mr. Sulu, you may indulge yourself.

32:37.745 --> 32:38.995
Aye, sir.

33:05.231 --> 33:06.690
Does that about do it?

33:06.774 --> 33:08.316
I don't think
there's another piece of information

33:08.401 --> 33:11.027
we could squeeze
into the memory banks.

33:11.737 --> 33:14.573
- Next time, we'll design a bigger one.
- Who'd wanna build it?

33:14.657 --> 33:18.326
Dr. Marcus? Comm-pic coming in
on hyperchannel.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.747
- It's the Starship Reliant.
- On the screen, please, Jedda.

33:23.708 --> 33:27.210
Come in, please.
This is the Reliant calling Regula I.

33:29.213 --> 33:31.631
Repeat, this is U.S.S. Reliant.

33:32.717 --> 33:36.261
CAROL: Commander, we are receiving.
This is Regula I. Go ahead.

33:37.221 --> 33:42.183
Dr. Marcus. Good. We're en route to
you and should be there in three days.

33:42.894 --> 33:46.897
En route? Why? We weren't expecting
you for another three months.

33:47.565 --> 33:50.150
- Has something happened?
- Nothing has happened.

33:50.234 --> 33:52.444
Ceti Alpha VI has checked out.

33:53.279 --> 33:57.198
- Then I don't understand why you...
- We have received new orders.

33:57.283 --> 33:59.492
Upon our arrival at Regula I,

33:59.744 --> 34:03.747
all materials of Project Genesis
will be transferred to this ship

- Who in the hell do they think they are?
- Please be quiet.

34:08.920 --> 34:11.963
Commander Chekov,
this is completely irregular.

34:12.547 --> 34:14.257
Who gave the order?

34:15.301 --> 34:18.219
The order comes
from Starfleet Command, Dr. Marcus,

34:18.304 --> 34:20.054
direct from the general staff.

34:20.139 --> 34:22.139
- It's a civilian...
- (SHUSHING)

34:22.224 --> 34:25.018
Genesis is a civilian project
under my control.

34:26.312 --> 34:29.397
- I have my orders.
- Pin him down, Mother.

34:30.107 --> 34:31.815
Who gave the order?

34:32.735 --> 34:34.485
The order comes from

34:37.489 --> 34:39.239
Admiral James T. Kirk.

34:39.324 --> 34:40.992
I knew it! I knew it!

34:41.409 --> 34:42.577
All along, the military's wanted to get...

34:42.661 --> 34:45.329
This is completely improper,
Commander Chekov.

34:45.414 --> 34:49.667
I have no intention of allowing Reliant
or any other unauthorized personnel

34:49.751 --> 34:52.085
access to our work or materials.

34:52.545 --> 34:57.258
I'm sorry that you feel that way, Doctor.
Admiral Kirk's orders are confirmed.

34:58.510 --> 35:02.763
Please prepare to deliver Genesis
to us upon our arrival. Reliant out.

35:06.351 --> 35:08.144
Well done, Commander.

35:10.397 --> 35:14.066
You realize, sir, they will attempt
to contact Admiral Kirk

35:14.151 --> 35:16.027
and confirm the order.

35:28.874 --> 35:30.333
SAAVIK: Hold, please.

35:33.462 --> 35:35.004
Thank you, sir.

35:37.799 --> 35:40.968
Lieutenant, are you wearing
your hair differently?

35:41.053 --> 35:43.346
It's still regulation, Admiral.

35:46.016 --> 35:47.642
May I speak, sir?

35:49.937 --> 35:53.481
Self-expression doesn't seem
to be one of your problems.

35:57.319 --> 36:00.988
You're bothered by your performance
on the Kobayashi Maru.

36:01.073 --> 36:02.698
I failed to resolve the situation.

36:02.783 --> 36:05.701
There's no correct resolution.
It's a test of character.

36:06.662 --> 36:09.288
May I ask how you dealt with the test?

36:12.000 --> 36:13.417
You may ask.

36:16.296 --> 36:18.089
That's a little joke.

36:18.674 --> 36:21.300
Humor. It is a difficult concept.

36:23.220 --> 36:24.887
It is not logical.

36:26.515 --> 36:27.932
We learn by doing.

36:28.016 --> 36:30.267
Who's been holding up
the damn elevator?

36:30.352 --> 36:31.852
Thank you, sir.

36:32.896 --> 36:36.065
- Did she change her hairstyle?
- I hadn't noticed.

36:36.733 --> 36:39.193
Wonderful stuff, that Romulan ale.

36:51.581 --> 36:53.708
- I'll take it in my quarters, Uhura.
- UHURA: Aye, sir.

36:53.792 --> 36:55.918
It never rains, but it pours.

36:57.421 --> 36:59.255
As a physician,
you of all people should appreciate

36:59.339 --> 37:01.757
the dangers of re-opening old wounds.

37:05.554 --> 37:06.679
Sorry.

37:06.763 --> 37:07.805
CAROL: Jim, can you read me?

37:07.889 --> 37:11.350
I can hear you, Carol. What's wrong?
What's the matter?

37:12.185 --> 37:14.895
Why are you taking Genesis
away from us?

37:15.814 --> 37:18.024
Taking Genesis?
Who's taking Genesis?

37:18.108 --> 37:19.900
Who is taking Genesis?

37:19.985 --> 37:22.820
- I can see you, but I can't hear.
- Carol...

37:23.280 --> 37:25.406
Jim, did you give the order?

37:26.533 --> 37:28.784
What order? Who's taking Genesis?

37:28.869 --> 37:29.994
Please help us, Jim.

37:30.078 --> 37:32.997
I will not let them have Genesis
without proper authorization!

37:33.081 --> 37:36.876
- Have Genesis? Who's taking...
- On whose authority can they do this?

37:36.960 --> 37:40.004
- No one's authority!
- (DISTORTED) Jim, please...

37:40.088 --> 37:41.088
Uhura, what's happening?

37:41.173 --> 37:43.883
UHURA:
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.

37:46.803 --> 37:49.555
- Alert Starfleet Headquarters.
- UHURA: Aye, sir.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.349
I want to talk to Starfleet Command.

37:52.767 --> 37:55.269
CAROL: Quiet.
We must have order in here.

37:55.353 --> 37:56.854
This has to be some sort of mistake.

37:56.938 --> 38:00.190
DAVID: Mistake! We're all alone here.

38:00.525 --> 38:03.360
They waited until everyone was on leave
to do this.

38:03.444 --> 38:06.405
Reliant is supposed to be
at our disposal, not vice-versa.

38:06.489 --> 38:07.614
It seems clear Starfleet never intended...

38:07.699 --> 38:09.825
CAROL: I know that,
but I can't believe the Starfleet...

38:09.909 --> 38:11.243
DAVID: I've tried warning you before.

38:11.327 --> 38:13.495
Scientists have always been pawns
of the military.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.247
Starfleet has kept the peace
for 100 years.

38:15.331 --> 38:19.334
I cannot and will not subscribe
to your interpretation of this event.

38:19.419 --> 38:22.754
You may be right, Doctor.
But what about Reliant?

38:24.507 --> 38:25.716
She's on her way.

38:28.219 --> 38:30.637
Now, get your gear together
where it's handy.

38:30.722 --> 38:31.972
And where are we going?

38:32.056 --> 38:34.683
That's for us to know,
and Reliant to find out.

38:45.861 --> 38:47.529
KIRK: We have a problem.

38:47.655 --> 38:50.991
Something may be wrong on Regula I.
We've been ordered to investigate.

38:52.868 --> 38:56.788
If memory serves, Regula I
is a scientific research laboratory.

38:57.373 --> 39:01.292
I told Starfleet Command
all we had was a boatload of children,

39:02.670 --> 39:05.380
but we're the only ship in the quadrant.

39:07.383 --> 39:10.468
Spock, these cadets of yours,
how good are they?

39:10.553 --> 39:12.637
How will they respond
under real pressure?

39:12.722 --> 39:16.224
As with all living things,
each according to his gifts.

39:17.393 --> 39:19.644
Of course, this ship is yours.

39:20.938 --> 39:23.106
No, that won't be necessary.

39:24.692 --> 39:26.317
Just get me to Regula I.

39:26.402 --> 39:30.905
As a teacher on a training mission,
I'm content to command the Enterprise.

39:31.323 --> 39:33.158
If we are to go on actual duty,

39:33.242 --> 39:37.203
it is clear that the senior officer
onboard must assume command.

39:37.288 --> 39:38.997
It may be nothing.

39:40.249 --> 39:42.167
Garbled communications.

39:43.919 --> 39:45.920
- You take the ship.
- Jim.

39:46.005 --> 39:48.548
You proceed from a false assumption.

39:48.841 --> 39:52.177
I'm a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.

39:56.390 --> 39:59.017
KIRK: You're about to remind me
that logic alone dictates your actions?

39:59.101 --> 40:02.562
I would not remind you
of that which you know so well.

40:03.105 --> 40:07.650
If I may be so bold, it was a mistake
for you to accept promotion.

40:08.944 --> 40:12.155
Commanding a starship is your first,
best destiny.

40:12.656 --> 40:15.617
Anything else is a waste of material.

40:16.786 --> 40:18.328
I would not presume to debate you.

40:19.455 --> 40:20.955
That is wise.

40:21.791 --> 40:24.334
In any case, were I to invoke logic,

40:24.960 --> 40:26.461
logic clearly dictates

40:26.545 --> 40:30.131
that the needs of the many
outweigh the needs of the few.

40:31.675 --> 40:33.051
Or the one.

40:39.391 --> 40:42.644
You are my superior officer.
You are also my friend.

40:43.854 --> 40:46.481
I have been and always shall be yours.

40:49.860 --> 40:52.070
- Stop energizers.
- SULU: Stop energizers.

40:52.154 --> 40:53.905
Put me on speakers.

40:56.951 --> 40:59.369
An emergency situation has arisen.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.747
By order of Starfleet Command,
as of now, 1800 hours,

41:02.832 --> 41:04.916
I'm assuming command of this vessel.

41:05.000 --> 41:06.918
Duty officer, so note in the ship's log.

41:07.002 --> 41:09.629
Plot a new course
for Space Laboratory Regula I.

41:09.713 --> 41:11.131
Engine Room.

41:11.507 --> 41:13.299
- Mr. Scott.
- SCOTTY ON INTERCOM: Aye, sir?

41:13.801 --> 41:16.511
- We'll be going to warp speed.
- Aye, sir.

41:17.346 --> 41:21.057
- Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral.
- KIRK: Engage warp engines.

41:22.268 --> 41:24.811
- Prepare for warp speed.
- Ready, sir.

41:28.190 --> 41:31.651
I know that none of you
were expecting this. I'm sorry.

41:31.777 --> 41:35.864
I'm going to have to ask you to grow up
a little bit sooner than you expected.

41:35.948 --> 41:37.407
Warp 5, Sulu.

41:39.869 --> 41:42.162
So much for the little training cruise.

41:51.046 --> 41:53.464
WOMAN: Course to intercept Enterprise
ready, sir.

41:53.549 --> 41:54.716
KHAN: Excellent.

41:55.050 --> 41:57.719
- Helmsman?
- Sir, may I speak?

42:03.475 --> 42:05.435
We're all with you, sir.

42:06.770 --> 42:08.438
But consider this.

42:09.398 --> 42:13.568
We are free. We have a ship
and the means to go where we will.

42:15.237 --> 42:18.364
We have escaped
permanent exile on Ceti Alpha V.

42:19.700 --> 42:25.455
You have proved your superior intellect
and defeated the plans of Admiral Kirk.

42:27.374 --> 42:29.918
You do not need to defeat him again.

42:30.753 --> 42:35.798
He tasks me.
He tasks me and I shall have him.

42:37.760 --> 42:41.054
I'll chase him round the moons of Nibia

42:41.138 --> 42:44.140
and round the Antares maelstrom

42:44.225 --> 42:48.228
and round perdition's flames
before I give him up.

42:51.941 --> 42:53.441
Prepare to alter course.

42:54.652 --> 42:57.779
UHURA:
Space Station Regula I, please come in.

42:58.113 --> 43:00.114
Dr. Marcus, please respond.

43:02.701 --> 43:04.744
This is Enterprise...

43:05.871 --> 43:08.665
It's no use.
There's no response from Regula I.

43:08.749 --> 43:11.626
- But no longer jammed?
- No, sir. No nothing.

43:19.260 --> 43:21.261
There are two possibilities.

43:21.345 --> 43:24.931
They are unable to respond.
They are unwilling to respond.

43:25.015 --> 43:28.351
- How far?
- 12 hours, 43 minutes, present speed.

43:31.689 --> 43:33.815
"Give up Genesis," she said.

43:34.566 --> 43:36.901
What in God's name does it mean?
Give it up to whom?

43:36.986 --> 43:40.655
It might help my analysis
if I knew what Genesis was,

43:41.031 --> 43:42.699
beyond the biblical reference.

43:42.783 --> 43:45.576
Uhura, have Dr. McCoy
join us in my quarters.

43:45.661 --> 43:47.453
UHURA: Aye, sir.
KIRK: Mr. Saavik?

43:48.580 --> 43:50.206
You have the conn.

43:54.712 --> 43:56.129
Well, I've got Sickbay ready.

43:56.213 --> 43:58.965
Now, will someone please tell me
what's going on?

44:00.759 --> 44:03.970
Computer. Request security procedure

44:04.513 --> 44:07.098
and access to Project Genesis
summary.

44:07.516 --> 44:10.101
COMPUTER VOICE:
Identify for retina scan.

44:10.185 --> 44:12.562
Kirk, Admiral James T.

44:20.362 --> 44:24.198
- Security Scan approved.
- Summary, please?

44:28.662 --> 44:32.248
Project Genesis.
A proposal to the Federation.

44:32.333 --> 44:35.376
- Carol Marcus.
- Yes.

44:35.753 --> 44:37.712
What exactly is Genesis?

44:38.964 --> 44:43.259
Well, put simply,
Genesis is life from lifelessness.

44:44.970 --> 44:48.431
It is a process whereby
molecular structure is reorganized

44:48.515 --> 44:53.353
at the subatomic level into
life-generating matter of equal mass.

44:53.896 --> 44:57.148
Stage one of our experiments
was conducted in the laboratory.

44:57.232 --> 45:01.486
Stage two of the series will be
attempted in a lifeless underground.

45:01.570 --> 45:05.239
Stage three will involve
the process on a planetary scale.

45:05.908 --> 45:08.993
It is our intention to introduce
the Genesis device

45:09.078 --> 45:12.330
into a preselected area
of a lifeless space body,

45:12.414 --> 45:14.248
a moon or other dead form.

45:15.209 --> 45:16.584
The device is delivered,

45:16.668 --> 45:20.254
instantaneously causing
what we call the Genesis Effect.

45:21.256 --> 45:24.550
Matter is reorganized
with life-generating results.

45:40.609 --> 45:43.736
Instead of a dead moon,
a living, breathing planet

45:43.821 --> 45:47.865
capable of sustaining whatever
life forms we see fit to deposit on it.

45:49.118 --> 45:50.243
Fascinating.

45:50.327 --> 45:52.286
The reformed moon simulated here

45:52.371 --> 45:55.498
represents the merest fraction
of the Genesis' potential,

45:55.582 --> 45:58.000
should the Federation
wish to fund these experiments

45:58.085 --> 46:00.211
to their logical conclusion.

46:00.796 --> 46:05.258
When we consider the cosmic problems
of population and food supply,

46:05.342 --> 46:08.302
the usefulness of this process
becomes clear.

46:08.637 --> 46:11.806
This concludes our proposal.
Thank you for your attention.

46:12.683 --> 46:14.642
It literally is genesis.

46:16.478 --> 46:18.146
Power of creation.

46:20.774 --> 46:22.692
Have they proceeded
with their experiments?

46:22.776 --> 46:24.068
KIRK: Well, the tape was made
about a year ago,

46:24.153 --> 46:27.613
so I can only assume
they've reached stage two by now.

46:28.115 --> 46:31.534
Dear Lord, do you think
we're intelligent enough to...

46:32.453 --> 46:36.998
Suppose... What if this thing
were used where life already exists?

46:37.374 --> 46:41.502
It would destroy such life
in favor of its new matrix.

46:42.171 --> 46:46.549
Its new matrix? Do you have any idea
what you're saying?

46:47.342 --> 46:51.304
I was not attempting to evaluate
its moral implications, Doctor.

46:51.513 --> 46:53.264
As a matter of cosmic history,

46:53.348 --> 46:56.601
it has always been easier to destroy
than to create.

46:56.685 --> 46:59.854
Not anymore!
Now we can do both at the same time.

47:00.189 --> 47:03.232
According to myth,
the Earth was created in six days.

47:03.317 --> 47:07.570
Now, watch out. Here comes Genesis.
We'll do it for you in six minutes.

47:07.820 --> 47:10.322
I do not dispute,
that in the wrong hands...

47:10.448 --> 47:12.157
"In the wrong hands?"

47:12.659 --> 47:16.912
Would you mind telling me whose are
the right hands, my logical friend?

47:19.624 --> 47:22.793
Are you, by any chance,
in favor of these experiments?

47:22.877 --> 47:24.002
Gentlemen, gentlemen, this isn't...

47:24.087 --> 47:27.673
Really, Dr. McCoy,
you must learn to govern your passions.

47:28.424 --> 47:31.885
They will be your undoing.
Logic suggests...

47:31.970 --> 47:35.430
Logic?
My God, the man's talking about logic.

47:35.974 --> 47:38.725
We're talking about
universal Armageddon.

47:39.269 --> 47:41.144
- You green-blooded, inhuman...
- SAAVIK: Bridge to Admiral Kirk.

47:42.814 --> 47:46.608
Admiral, sensors indicate
a vessel in our area, closing fast.

47:47.401 --> 47:51.071
- What do you make of her?
- It's one of ours, Admiral. It's Reliant.

47:51.155 --> 47:52.405
SPOCK: Reliant?

47:55.910 --> 47:57.994
Try the emergency channels.

48:02.667 --> 48:04.417
Picture, Mr. Saavik.

48:20.184 --> 48:22.102
KHAN: Slow to one-half impulse power.

48:23.437 --> 48:28.150
- Let's be friends.
- Slowing to one-half impulse power.

48:28.776 --> 48:32.320
Reliant in our section,
this quadrant, sir, and slowing.

48:33.281 --> 48:37.534
Sir? May I quote General Order 12?
"On the approach of any vessel

48:37.618 --> 48:39.369
"when communications
have not been established..."

48:39.453 --> 48:42.998
Lieutenant. The Admiral is well aware
of the regulations.

48:44.167 --> 48:45.458
Aye, sir.

48:49.297 --> 48:52.174
KIRK: Is it possible
their comm system has failed?

48:52.884 --> 48:54.426
SPOCK:
It would explain a great many things.

48:55.094 --> 48:57.721
They're requesting communications, sir.

48:58.181 --> 48:59.598
Let them eat static.

49:01.934 --> 49:04.394
JOACHIM:
They're still running with shields down.

49:04.478 --> 49:07.772
Of course. We are one big happy fleet.

49:08.774 --> 49:09.733
(SIGHS LOUDLY)

49:09.817 --> 49:12.569
Kirk, my old friend.

49:13.321 --> 49:15.947
Do you know the Klingon proverb
that tells us,

49:16.032 --> 49:19.659
"Revenge is a dish
that is best served cold?"

49:22.788 --> 49:27.292
It is very cold in space.

49:37.261 --> 49:39.137
This is damn peculiar.

49:41.182 --> 49:43.808
- Yellow alert.
- Energize defense fields.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.602
(ALARM BLARING)

49:50.399 --> 49:51.775
I'm getting a voice message.

49:51.859 --> 49:55.278
They say their chambers coil
is overloading their comm system.

49:55.363 --> 49:57.030
- Spock?
- Scanning.

49:58.282 --> 49:59.741
Their coil emissions are normal.

50:03.079 --> 50:06.539
- They still haven't raised their shields.
- Raise ours.

50:09.043 --> 50:10.043
Their shields are going up.

50:10.127 --> 50:11.878
Lock phasers on target.

50:13.297 --> 50:14.756
Locking phasers on target.

50:14.882 --> 50:17.008
- They're locking phasers.
- Raise shields.

50:17.093 --> 50:18.218
Fire!

50:33.442 --> 50:35.318
- Sulu, get those shields up.
- Trying, sir.

50:37.989 --> 50:40.532

MAN: I need air! I need air!

50:58.718 --> 51:00.593
I can't get power, sir.

51:02.763 --> 51:03.972
Scotty?

51:04.765 --> 51:07.892
- Uhura, turn off those damn channels!
- Mr. Scott on the screen.

51:07.977 --> 51:12.397
We're just hanging on, sir.
The main energizer's out.

51:12.481 --> 51:15.984
- KIRK: Try auxiliary power!
- Aye, aye, sir.

51:16.068 --> 51:17.569
Damage report.

51:24.827 --> 51:26.453
They knew exactly where to hit us.

51:26.537 --> 51:29.956
Who? Who knew where to hit us?
And why?

51:30.041 --> 51:33.710
One thing is certain.
We cannot escape on auxiliary power.

51:35.838 --> 51:37.047
Visual.

51:39.884 --> 51:42.052
- Sulu, divert all power to phasers.
- SPOCK: Too late.

51:42.136 --> 51:43.386
Hang on!

51:54.648 --> 51:57.442
KIRK: Scotty! What's left?

51:57.526 --> 52:01.112
SCOTTY: Just the batteries, sir. I can
have auxiliary power in a few minutes.

52:01.197 --> 52:03.323
We don't have a few minutes!

52:09.497 --> 52:12.665
- Can you give me phaser power?
- A few shots, sir.

52:12.750 --> 52:15.168
- Not enough against their shields.
- Who the hell are they?

52:15.252 --> 52:18.546
UHURA: Admiral, the Commander
of the Reliant is signaling.

52:18.756 --> 52:21.674
He wishes to discuss
terms of our surrender.

52:31.685 --> 52:33.478
- Put it on screen.
- UHURA: Admiral...

52:33.562 --> 52:36.231
Do it! While we still have time.

52:43.114 --> 52:44.656
UHURA: On screen, sir.

52:54.166 --> 52:56.251
- Khan.
- You still remember, Admiral.

52:57.294 --> 53:02.632
I cannot help but be touched.
I, of course, remember you.

53:02.716 --> 53:06.970
What is the meaning of this attack?
Where is the crew of the Reliant?

53:07.763 --> 53:10.306
Surely I have made my meaning plain.

53:10.724 --> 53:14.227
I mean to avenge myself
upon you, Admiral.

53:14.562 --> 53:16.396
I've deprived your ship of power,

53:16.480 --> 53:20.191
and when I swing around,
I mean to deprive you of your life.

53:22.236 --> 53:26.364
But I wanted you to know first
who it was who had beaten you.

53:27.992 --> 53:32.537
Khan, if it's me you want,

53:34.081 --> 53:37.417
I'll have myself beamed aboard.
Spare my crew.

53:38.169 --> 53:40.420
I make you a counterproposal.

53:40.754 --> 53:47.302
I'll agree to your terms if,
in addition to yourself,

53:47.386 --> 53:50.263
you hand over to me
all data and material

53:50.347 --> 53:53.933
regarding the project called Genesis.

53:54.727 --> 53:58.438
- Genesis? What's that?
- Don't insult my intelligence, Kirk.

53:59.148 --> 54:02.525
Give me some time to recall
the data on our computers.

54:02.610 --> 54:04.944
I give you 60 seconds, Admiral.

54:11.827 --> 54:13.453
KIRK: Clear the Bridge.

54:19.043 --> 54:21.794
At least we know
he doesn't have Genesis.

54:22.254 --> 54:25.298
Keep nodding
as though I'm still giving orders.

54:25.466 --> 54:29.219
Mr. Saavik, punch up the data charts
of Reliant's command console.

54:29.303 --> 54:30.678
Reliant's command?

54:30.763 --> 54:31.888
- Hurry!
- 45 seconds.

54:31.972 --> 54:33.848
- The prefix code?
- That's all we've got.

54:40.314 --> 54:42.565
SAAVIK: The chart's up, sir.
KHAN: Admiral.

54:42.942 --> 54:44.567
We're finding it.

54:46.111 --> 54:47.153
Admiral.

54:47.488 --> 54:48.738
KIRK: Please.

54:48.822 --> 54:50.448
Please, you've gotta give us time.

54:50.533 --> 54:53.243
The Bridge is smashed.
The computer's inoperative.

54:53.327 --> 54:56.037
Time is a luxury
you don't have, Admiral.

55:03.420 --> 55:04.504
Damn!

55:06.006 --> 55:08.716
- Admiral?
- It's coming through now, Khan.

55:13.264 --> 55:18.601
- Reliant's prefix number is 16309.
- I don't understand.

55:18.686 --> 55:21.729
You have to learn
why things work on a starship.

55:21.814 --> 55:24.107
Each ship has its own combination code

55:24.191 --> 55:27.527
to prevent an enemy
from doing what we're attempting.

55:28.404 --> 55:33.408
We're using our console
to order Reliant to lower her shields.

55:33.492 --> 55:36.578
Assuming he hasn't changed
the combination. He's quite intelligent.

55:36.662 --> 55:38.663
Fifteen seconds, Admiral.

55:43.419 --> 55:46.129
Khan, how do we know
you'll keep your word?

55:46.213 --> 55:48.881
I've given you no word to keep, Admiral.

55:49.550 --> 55:52.635
In my judgment,
you simply have no alternative.

55:55.723 --> 55:57.390
I see your point.

55:58.684 --> 56:01.269
Stand by to receive our transmission.

56:02.605 --> 56:05.898
Mr. Sulu, lock the phasers on target
and await my command.

56:05.983 --> 56:07.525
Phasers locked.

56:08.652 --> 56:12.864
- Time's up, Admiral.
- Here it comes.

56:14.366 --> 56:15.867
Now, Mr. Spock.

56:20.623 --> 56:22.123
(BEEPING)

56:22.207 --> 56:24.417
Sir, our shields are dropping.

56:26.462 --> 56:29.797
- Raise them.
- I can't!

56:32.259 --> 56:34.177
Where's the override? The override?

56:34.762 --> 56:35.845
Fire.

56:38.557 --> 56:39.641
Fire.

56:44.772 --> 56:46.689
Fire! Fire!

56:46.774 --> 56:49.025
- We can't fire, sir.
- Why can't you?

56:49.276 --> 56:53.655
They've damaged the photon control
and the warp drive. We must withdraw.

56:53.906 --> 56:55.782
- No! No!
- Sir, we must!

57:02.956 --> 57:06.626
Enterprise can wait.
She's not going anywhere.

57:15.803 --> 57:18.137
- SULU: Sir, you did it.
- I did nothing.

57:19.807 --> 57:22.266
Except get caught
with my breeches down.

57:22.476 --> 57:24.102
I must be getting senile.

57:25.020 --> 57:28.106
Mr. Saavik, you go right on
quoting regulations.

57:29.400 --> 57:31.734
In the meantime,
let's find out how badly we've been hurt.

(UHURA GASPS)

58:21.034 --> 58:22.535
Is the word given, Admiral?

58:22.827 --> 58:24.411
The word is given.

58:26.247 --> 58:27.623
Warp speed.

58:28.499 --> 58:29.583
Aye.

(PRESTON SIGHING)

58:47.185 --> 58:48.185
Why?

58:51.439 --> 58:53.148
He wants to kill me

58:53.233 --> 58:56.151
for passing sentence on him
15 years ago.

58:56.236 --> 58:59.738
And he doesn't care who stands
between him and his vengeance.

I'm sorry, Scotty.

when the trainees ran.

Yes, Spock?

Best speed to Regula I. Kirk out.

59:26.557 --> 59:28.475
Scotty, I have to ask.

59:29.978 --> 59:32.646
Is there any chance of getting
the mains back on the line?

59:32.730 --> 59:35.983
I do not think so, sir,
but you'll have my best.

59:37.026 --> 59:40.362
Thanks, I know you tried, Doctor.

59:48.037 --> 59:49.746
Are you all right?

59:49.831 --> 59:51.206
(SIGHING)

59:51.291 --> 59:52.916
I don't know.

59:53.418 --> 59:56.503
Doctors lose patients sometimes.
Damn it.

59:57.964 --> 01:00:00.465
I'm still in the dark.
How did he know about Genesis?

01:00:00.550 --> 01:00:02.092
I don't know.

01:00:03.636 --> 01:00:06.972
But what's important now is to
prevent him from getting his hands on it.

01:00:07.056 --> 01:00:11.018
You said it yourself, it's a bang
that could rearrange the universe.

01:00:11.102 --> 01:00:12.686
There still may be time.

01:00:15.189 --> 01:00:17.190
You gave as good as you got.

01:00:20.194 --> 01:00:21.194
We're alive only because

01:00:21.279 --> 01:00:24.197
I knew something about these ships
that he didn't.

SULU: Approaching Regula
and Space Lab Regula I.

01:00:33.875 --> 01:00:36.668
UHURA: Space Station Regula I,
this is the Starship Enterprise.

01:00:36.753 --> 01:00:38.295
Please come in.

01:00:42.133 --> 01:00:44.676

01:00:47.555 --> 01:00:51.475
Space Station Regula I,
this is Enterprise. Please acknowledge.

01:00:53.394 --> 01:00:55.896
This is Enterprise. Do you read me?

01:00:58.649 --> 01:01:02.944
Space Station Regula I, do you read?
Please come in.

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:05.781
There's no response, sir.

01:01:09.702 --> 01:01:11.203
Sensors, Captain?

01:01:11.287 --> 01:01:13.622
The scanners and sensors
are still inoperative.

01:01:13.706 --> 01:01:16.249
There's no way
to ascertain what's inside the station.

01:01:16.334 --> 01:01:18.460
No way of telling
if Reliant is still in the area.

01:01:18.544 --> 01:01:19.878
Precisely.

01:01:20.046 --> 01:01:22.464
KIRK: What do you make
of that planetoid beyond?

01:01:22.548 --> 01:01:24.382
SPOCK: Regula is Class-D.

01:01:24.467 --> 01:01:28.220
It consists
of various unremarkable ores,

01:01:28.721 --> 01:01:30.430
essentially a great rock in space.

01:01:30.515 --> 01:01:32.390
And Reliant could be hiding
behind that rock.

01:01:32.475 --> 01:01:34.392
A distinct possibility.

01:01:36.521 --> 01:01:38.355
- Engineering.
- SCOTTY: Aye, sir?

01:01:38.439 --> 01:01:41.733
Mr. Scott? Do you have
enough power for transporters?

01:01:42.777 --> 01:01:44.194
Barely, sir.

01:01:46.948 --> 01:01:49.449
- KIRK: I'm going down there.
- Khan could be down there.

01:01:49.534 --> 01:01:51.326
He's been there,
hasn't found what he wants.

01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:53.078
Can you spare someone?
There may be people hurt.

01:01:53.162 --> 01:01:56.164
- Yeah, I can spare me.
- SAAVIK: Begging the Admiral's pardon.

"into a hazardous area

There's no such regulation.

01:02:08.261 --> 01:02:10.846
All right, join the party.
Mr. Spock, the ship is yours.

this is Lieutenant Saavik.
We're all right. Please stand by. Out.

Oh, sir, it was Khan.

01:05:03.936 --> 01:05:07.522
- We found him on Ceti Alpha V.
- Easy. Easy, Pav.

01:05:08.274 --> 01:05:14.446
He put creatures in our bodies
to control our minds.

01:05:16.324 --> 01:05:18.658
McCOY: It's all right. You're safe now.

01:05:18.784 --> 01:05:21.619
Made us say lies, do things.

01:05:22.955 --> 01:05:24.748
But we beat him.

01:05:24.832 --> 01:05:27.751
He thought he controlled us,
but he did not.

01:05:28.627 --> 01:05:31.046
- The Captain was strong.
- Captain.

01:05:32.506 --> 01:05:36.634
Where's Dr. Marcus?
Where are the Genesis materials?

01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:40.889
He couldn't find them.
Even the data banks were empty.

01:05:41.307 --> 01:05:44.768
- Erased?
- He tortured those people,

01:05:45.895 --> 01:05:49.898
but none of them
would tell him anything. He went wild.

01:05:49.982 --> 01:05:55.028
He slit their throats.
He wanted to tear the place apart.

01:05:56.238 --> 01:05:57.572
But he was late.

01:05:57.656 --> 01:06:00.825
He had to get back to the Reliant
in time to blow you to bits.

01:06:01.535 --> 01:06:03.745
Where's Reliant's crew? Dead?

01:06:05.915 --> 01:06:07.916
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V.

01:06:09.293 --> 01:06:13.046
He's completely mad, Admiral.
He blames you for the death of his wife.

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:15.340
I know what he blames me for.

01:06:19.303 --> 01:06:24.849
The escape pods are all in place.
Where's the Transporter Room?

01:06:27.019 --> 01:06:30.188
- Did he make it down here?
- It was not my impression.

01:06:30.272 --> 01:06:31.439
He spent most of his time

01:06:31.524 --> 01:06:33.858
trying to wring the information
out of the people.

01:06:33.943 --> 01:06:36.778
SAAVIK: Anything?
KIRK: The unit's been left on.

01:06:38.364 --> 01:06:40.657
Which means
nobody remained to turn it off.

01:06:40.741 --> 01:06:45.161
Those people back there bought
escape time for Genesis with their lives.

01:06:45.246 --> 01:06:46.621
This is not logical.

01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:50.125
These coordinates
are deep inside Regula,

it was going to be underground.

Admiral, if we go by the book,
like Lieutenant Saavik,

01:07:14.024 --> 01:07:16.109
hours could seem like days.

01:07:16.861 --> 01:07:20.363
- I read you, Captain. Let's have it.
- The situation is grave, Admiral.

01:07:20.448 --> 01:07:25.535
We won't have main power for six days.
Auxiliary power has temporarily failed.

01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:31.708
Restoration may be possible
in two days, by the book, Admiral.

01:07:31.792 --> 01:07:35.253
- Meaning you can't even beam us back?
- Not at present.

01:07:38.174 --> 01:07:41.759
Captain Spock. If you don't hear
from us within one hour,

01:07:42.428 --> 01:07:45.013
your orders are to restore
what power you can,

01:07:45.097 --> 01:07:47.724
take the Enterprise
to the nearest starbase

01:07:47.808 --> 01:07:50.435
and alert Starfleet Command
as soon as you're out of jamming range.

01:07:50.519 --> 01:07:52.812
UHURA: Sir, we won't leave you behind.

01:07:52.938 --> 01:07:57.442
Uhura, if you don't hear from us,
there won't be anybody behind. Kirk out.

01:07:58.611 --> 01:08:01.321
Well, gentlemen,
you can stay here, or...

01:08:01.655 --> 01:08:04.782
If it's all the same, Admiral,
we'd like to share the risk.

01:08:06.577 --> 01:08:08.870
Right. Let's go. Saavik?

01:08:10.831 --> 01:08:13.958
- Go? Where are we going?
- Where they went.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.462
Suppose they went nowhere?

01:08:18.796 --> 01:08:22.425
Then this will be your big chance
to get away from it all.

01:08:51.622 --> 01:08:52.830
Admiral.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:08.971

Mother, he killed everybody
we left behind.

01:09:53.017 --> 01:09:54.767
Of course he didn't.

01:09:56.061 --> 01:09:57.979
David, you're just making this harder.

01:09:58.063 --> 01:10:01.357
I'm afraid it's even harder
than you think, Doctor.

01:10:01.984 --> 01:10:04.652
Please don't move.

01:10:05.321 --> 01:10:09.907
- Chekov.
- I'm sorry, Admiral.

01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:14.245
Your Excellency,
have you been listening?

01:10:17.583 --> 01:10:19.917
I have indeed, Captain.

Admiral, I've got to take
the mains off the line.

01:28:53.488 --> 01:28:56.031
- It's the radiation...
- Scotty.

01:28:57.158 --> 01:28:58.367
KHAN: Joachim!

01:29:00.036 --> 01:29:04.998
Yours is superior...

01:29:13.341 --> 01:29:14.550
I shall avenge you.

01:29:24.936 --> 01:29:27.646
Could you use another hand, Admiral?

01:29:28.690 --> 01:29:30.190
Man the weapons console, Mr. Chekov.

01:29:35.405 --> 01:29:38.157
- Spock.
- SPOCK: Sporadic energy readings.

01:29:38.241 --> 01:29:40.993
Port side, aft. Could be an impulse turn.

01:29:43.037 --> 01:29:44.913
He won't break off now.

01:29:46.499 --> 01:29:49.209
He followed me this far, he'll be back.

01:29:51.004 --> 01:29:52.546
But from where?

01:29:53.673 --> 01:29:56.341
He's intelligent but not experienced.

01:29:57.302 --> 01:30:00.387
His pattern indicates
two-dimensional thinking.

01:30:07.395 --> 01:30:09.480
- Full stop.
- Full stop, sir.

01:30:11.774 --> 01:30:14.943
Z-minus 10,000 meters.
Stand by photon torpedoes.

01:31:08.206 --> 01:31:09.998
Torpedoes ready, sir.

01:31:20.843 --> 01:31:22.177
Look sharp.

01:31:26.015 --> 01:31:26.682
Fire!

01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:35.023
Fire!

01:32:08.182 --> 01:32:13.854
Uhura, send to Commander Reliant,
"Prepare to be boarded."

01:32:13.938 --> 01:32:15.230
UHURA: Aye, sir.

01:32:16.566 --> 01:32:18.942
Commander Reliant, this is Enterprise.

01:32:19.777 --> 01:32:22.321
Surrender and prepare to be boarded.

01:32:22.905 --> 01:32:27.326
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

01:32:39.088 --> 01:32:41.006
Reliant, come in, Reliant.

01:32:42.091 --> 01:32:44.676
You are ordered
to surrender your vessel.

01:32:45.011 --> 01:32:49.431
Enterprise to Reliant. You are ordered
to surrender your vessel. Respond.

01:33:04.781 --> 01:33:06.031
No, Kirk.

01:33:07.575 --> 01:33:09.326
The game's not over.

01:33:46.072 --> 01:33:49.908
"To the last I will grapple with thee."

01:34:00.837 --> 01:34:02.462
(RINGING)

01:34:04.215 --> 01:34:08.218
Admiral, scanning an energy source
on Reliant,

01:34:09.470 --> 01:34:11.847
a pattern I've never seen before.

01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:19.688
- It's the Genesis wave.
- What?

01:34:19.939 --> 01:34:22.482
DAVID:
They're on a build-up to detonation.

01:34:23.818 --> 01:34:26.319
- How soon?
- We encoded four minutes.

01:34:26.863 --> 01:34:29.698
- We'll beam aboard and stop it.
- You can't.

01:34:32.702 --> 01:34:36.538
Scotty, I need warp speed
in three minutes or we're all dead.

01:34:38.541 --> 01:34:40.751
UHURA: No response, Admiral.
KIRK: Scotty!

01:34:41.002 --> 01:34:43.628
Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Best possible speed.

01:34:43.713 --> 01:34:44.963
SULU: Aye, sir.

01:35:23.544 --> 01:35:25.587
Are you out of your Vulcan mind?

01:35:25.671 --> 01:35:28.131
No human can tolerate
the radiation that's in there.

01:35:28.257 --> 01:35:31.760
As you are so fond of observing,
Doctor, I am not human.

01:35:33.221 --> 01:35:35.263
You're not going in there.

01:35:36.724 --> 01:35:40.018
Perhaps you're right.
What is Mr. Scott's condition?

01:35:41.938 --> 01:35:43.814
Well, I don't think that he...

01:35:43.898 --> 01:35:47.609
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I have no time to discuss this logically.

01:35:51.864 --> 01:35:53.114
Remember.

01:36:02.792 --> 01:36:05.001
Spock! Get out of there!

01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:06.962
Spock!

01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:08.839
Spock! Get out of there!

01:36:20.184 --> 01:36:23.144
- Time from my mark?
- Two minutes, 10 seconds.

01:36:23.813 --> 01:36:26.314
Engine Room, what's happening?

01:36:26.482 --> 01:36:28.191
Spock!

01:36:28.693 --> 01:36:30.235
SCOTTY: Spock! Get out of there!
McCOY: Good God, man,

01:36:30.319 --> 01:36:31.736
get out of there!

01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:35.282
SCOTTY: No! Don't! Don't!
McCOY: Spock! Spock!

01:36:35.366 --> 01:36:36.950
(WHOOSHING)

01:37:05.521 --> 01:37:06.605
Time?

01:37:08.691 --> 01:37:10.734
Three minutes, 30 seconds.

01:37:16.449 --> 01:37:19.910
- Distance from Reliant?
- 4,000 kilometers.

01:37:20.202 --> 01:37:22.704
We're not gonna make it, are we?

01:37:34.717 --> 01:37:35.759
No.

01:37:37.762 --> 01:37:39.679
No, you can't get away.

01:37:42.725 --> 01:37:46.645
"From hell's heart I stab at thee.

01:37:48.856 --> 01:37:55.695
"For hate's sake
I spit my last breath at thee."

01:38:08.751 --> 01:38:12.587
- Sir, the mains are back online.
- Bless you, Scotty. Go, Sulu!

01:38:56.382 --> 01:38:58.425
My God, Carol. Look at it.

01:39:10.521 --> 01:39:14.149
Engine Room. Well done, Scotty.

01:39:15.609 --> 01:39:19.154
McCOY:
Jim, I think you'd better get down here.

01:39:20.656 --> 01:39:23.825
- Bones?
- Better hurry.

01:39:27.830 --> 01:39:29.664
Saavik, take the conn.

01:39:58.027 --> 01:40:00.528
No! You'll flood the whole compartment.

01:40:00.613 --> 01:40:03.281
- He'll die.
- Sir, he's dead already.

01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:09.621
It's too late.

01:40:32.394 --> 01:40:33.561
Spock!

01:41:04.260 --> 01:41:07.762
(HOARSELY) Ship out of danger?

01:41:09.974 --> 01:41:11.057
Yes.

01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:16.604
Don't grieve, Admiral.

01:41:19.650 --> 01:41:21.151
It is logical.

01:41:24.697 --> 01:41:27.949
The needs of the many outweigh...

01:41:30.327 --> 01:41:34.122
- The needs of the few.
- Or the one.

01:41:43.799 --> 01:41:47.719
I never took the Kobayashi Maru test.

01:41:49.471 --> 01:41:50.805
Until now.

01:41:53.184 --> 01:41:55.602
What do you think of my solution?

01:41:58.439 --> 01:41:59.606
Spock.

01:42:11.493 --> 01:42:16.998
I have been, and always shall be,
your friend.

01:42:23.339 --> 01:42:27.342
Live long and prosper.

01:42:49.657 --> 01:42:50.698
No.

01:43:10.928 --> 01:43:13.346
KIRK: We are assembled here today

01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:16.474
to pay final respects
to our honored dead.

01:43:23.107 --> 01:43:26.859
And yet it should be noted that,
in the midst of our sorrow,

01:43:27.111 --> 01:43:30.280
this death takes place
in the shadow of new life,

01:43:30.572 --> 01:43:32.657
the sunrise of a new world,

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:37.453
a world that our beloved comrade
gave his life to protect and nourish.

01:43:38.414 --> 01:43:41.624
He did not feel this sacrifice
a vain or empty one,

01:43:42.668 --> 01:43:45.795
and we will not debate his profound
wisdom at these proceedings.

01:43:49.341 --> 01:43:51.759
Of my friend, I can only say this.

01:43:57.099 --> 01:44:00.268
Of all the souls I have
encountered in my travels,

01:44:01.395 --> 01:44:03.104
(SOBS) his was the most

01:44:06.775 --> 01:44:08.067
human.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.779
SULU: Honors!

01:44:15.743 --> 01:44:18.536
(SCOTTY PLAYING AMAZING GRACE
ON BAGPIPE)

01:45:34.571 --> 01:45:36.155
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

01:45:36.448 --> 01:45:37.532
Come.

01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:43.079
I don't mean to intrude.

01:45:44.081 --> 01:45:47.583
No, not at all. I should be on the Bridge.

01:45:49.711 --> 01:45:52.046
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:45:52.297 --> 01:45:53.965
I poured myself a drink.
Would you like it?

01:45:54.049 --> 01:45:56.175
Lieutenant Saavik was right.

01:45:58.387 --> 01:46:00.555
You never have faced death.

01:46:09.815 --> 01:46:11.482
No, not like this.

01:46:14.403 --> 01:46:17.530
I haven't faced death.
I've cheated death.

01:46:21.285 --> 01:46:23.619
I've tricked my way out of death

01:46:24.079 --> 01:46:27.123
and patted myself on the back
for my ingenuity.

01:46:31.253 --> 01:46:32.378
I know nothing.

01:46:32.463 --> 01:46:35.006
You knew enough to tell Saavik
that how we face death

01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:37.717
is at least as important
as how we face life.

01:46:40.137 --> 01:46:42.597
- Just words.
- But good words.

01:46:44.558 --> 01:46:48.519
That's where ideas begin.
Maybe you should listen to them.

01:46:52.024 --> 01:46:56.277
I was wrong about you and I'm sorry.

01:47:00.491 --> 01:47:04.410
- Is that what you came here to say?
- Mainly.

01:47:11.710 --> 01:47:15.671
And also that I'm proud,

01:47:18.091 --> 01:47:21.469
very proud to be your son.

01:47:51.333 --> 01:47:54.669
KIRK: Captain's Log, Stardate 8141.6.

01:47:55.212 --> 01:47:57.713
Starship Enterprise
departing for Ceti Alpha V

01:47:57.798 --> 01:48:00.383
to pick up the crew of U.S.S. Reliant.

01:48:01.552 --> 01:48:02.969
All is well.

01:48:03.679 --> 01:48:07.682
And yet, I can't help wondering
about the friend I leave behind.

01:48:09.351 --> 01:48:12.270
"There are always possibilities,"
Spock said.

01:48:12.938 --> 01:48:16.691
And if Genesis is indeed life from death,

01:48:18.485 --> 01:48:20.903
I must return to this place again.

01:48:25.701 --> 01:48:30.538
He's really not dead,
as long as we remember him.

01:48:37.129 --> 01:48:41.090
"It's a far, far better thing I do
than I have ever done before.

01:48:44.094 --> 01:48:48.889
"A far better resting place I go to

01:48:49.766 --> 01:48:51.100
"than I have ever known."

01:48:51.852 --> 01:48:53.394
Is that a poem?

01:48:55.897 --> 01:48:59.233
Something Spock was trying
to tell me on my birthday.

01:49:00.235 --> 01:49:03.529
You okay, Jim? How do you feel?

01:49:07.075 --> 01:49:08.242
Young.

01:49:10.412 --> 01:49:11.871
(INHALES)

01:49:12.497 --> 01:49:13.956
I feel young.

01:50:26.863 --> 01:50:29.740
SPOCK: Space, the final frontier.

01:50:30.909 --> 01:50:36.497
These are the continuing voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:50:37.999 --> 01:50:43.254
Her ongoing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,

01:50:44.548 --> 01:50:49.218
to seek out new life forms
and new civilizations,

01:50:50.387 --> 01:50:56.183
to boldly go
where no man has gone before.
