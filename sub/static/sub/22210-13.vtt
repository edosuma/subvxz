00:02.252 --> 00:06.212
<i>My name is Barry Allen,
and I am the fastest man alive.</i>

00:06.381 --> 00:09.294
<i>To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist,</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:12.172
<i>but secretly, with the help
of my friends at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.262 --> 00:15.050
<i>I fight crime
and find other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.474 --> 00:17.181
<i>But I became lost in time.</i>

00:17.267 --> 00:20.055
<i>It took everything in my friends'
power to bring me back.</i>

00:20.229 --> 00:23.313
<i>And in doing so, our world
was opened up to new threats.</i>

00:23.440 --> 00:25.898
<i>And I'm the only one fast enough
to stop them.</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:28.476
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:29.196 --> 00:31.062
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:31.156 --> 00:34.149
These tears are just more than water,
it's like a love drug.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.111
I think I can read minds.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.321
<i>Cecile's a telepath.</i>

00:39.414 --> 00:42.657
That's way more important
than getting Allen out of prison.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.663
Cecile filed an appeal last week.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.745
We have no new evidence,
so that doesn't matter.

00:46.838 --> 00:47.828
Did you know
the oscillating cameras

00:47.923 --> 00:48.913
aren't the only ones in this wing?

00:49.174 --> 00:50.415
You're the Flash.

00:50.509 --> 00:52.296
You said to call you
when I was ready to do business.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.378
Do you have another fish to sell me?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.513
Welcome to my own personal meta-block.

01:02.271 --> 01:04.854
Built on the ruins
of the first Iron Heights,

01:04.940 --> 01:07.353
completely off the books
and camera-free.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.685
Yes, yes, less history lesson,
more window shopping.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.606
Mina Chaytan.
Her powers bring effigies to life.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.612
Now that is a nifty trick.

01:17.411 --> 01:19.368
Can she animate anything else? Hmm?

01:19.830 --> 01:21.287
- How about my finger?
- Oh!

01:21.748 --> 01:23.740
I like her. She's feisty.

01:23.834 --> 01:26.451
Then you are going to love me.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.161
And I'll come willingly, gorgeous.

01:28.255 --> 01:29.245
Sylbert Rundine.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.797
He can shrink objects
and return them to original size.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.966
I know a drug smuggler who would pay
a pretty pence for that man.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.671
Ramsey Deacon, controls technology.

01:38.098 --> 01:41.887
And Becky Sharpe can manipulate luck
on the quantum level.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.969
I smell a bidding war.

01:45.689 --> 01:49.148
And who might this be?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.317
Something you've been wanting
for a long time.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.194
A speedster.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.396
The piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.861
Terms are the same as always.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.193
Any metas you sell,
we split the profits evenly.

02:00.579 --> 02:02.161
So, who would you like?

02:02.414 --> 02:07.455
Oh, well, eenie, meenie,

02:08.502 --> 02:11.086
miny...

02:11.173 --> 02:13.756
All of them!

02:20.515 --> 02:22.677
Drakkar Noir...

02:22.809 --> 02:24.220
Onions...

02:25.103 --> 02:27.390
And liverwurst?

02:27.481 --> 02:29.097
Oh, no.

02:37.866 --> 02:39.232
Earl Cox.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.193
Earl! It's the cops.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.153
It wasn't me! I'll fight
every one of you...

02:44.247 --> 02:45.704
Hiyah! Hiyah!

02:46.458 --> 02:47.699
Oh!

02:47.834 --> 02:49.041
Hello, Ralphy.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.413
How'd you get in here, Earl?

02:50.504 --> 02:52.496
- The door was unlocked.
- No, it wasn't.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.751
Was after I picked it.

02:56.551 --> 03:00.591
Ow! Oh, look at you,
you went all Zac Efron on me.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.549
What, you drink so many six-packs,
you end up growing one?

03:03.642 --> 03:04.723
Nice suit, Earl.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.928
Ah, thank you, kindly.
Armani knockoff, I love it.

03:08.021 --> 03:10.638
Listen, it's always great seeing you,
but if you'll excuse me,

03:10.732 --> 03:12.268
I've got a very busy day.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.103
Clear your calendar, slim,

03:14.569 --> 03:17.528
'cause I've got a score that will
knock your honey-glazed holiday ham

03:17.614 --> 03:18.946
into next Christmas.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.740
Yeah, I don't think any of those
words mean what you think they do.

03:21.827 --> 03:23.363
How about these words for you?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.578
A rich, old heiress hires me

03:25.664 --> 03:28.372
to find out if her boyfriend,
the pool boy,

03:28.458 --> 03:29.494
is a gold-digger.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.034
Turns out he is.

03:31.128 --> 03:34.621
But pool boy is
willing to share said gold

03:34.798 --> 03:38.166
with someone who can help him
keep up appearances, so to speak.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.217
And that, my friend, is your specialty.

03:40.303 --> 03:41.794
Are you in?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.971
I don't do that kind of stuff anymore.

03:44.307 --> 03:45.639
Ralph Dibny's gone straight.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.467
You serious?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.974
I got friends now. They're good people.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.685
Helped me turn over a new leaf.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.310
- Are they now?
- Yeah.

03:57.446 --> 03:58.857
We'll see.

03:59.906 --> 04:02.273
- Meaning?
- Meaning...

04:03.660 --> 04:06.027
I love you, Ralphy, I really do.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.987
But you let people down.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.372
Especially the good ones.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.493
They get close to you,
place their trust in you,

04:13.754 --> 04:15.290
and then, bam,

04:15.505 --> 04:16.837
you screw up.

04:17.214 --> 04:19.377
Every single time.

04:20.510 --> 04:22.297
So when you let your new friends down,

04:23.388 --> 04:24.845
give your old one a call.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.267
Thanks for coming, Cecile.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.974
I know Barry isn't too optimistic
about the appeal hearing.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.560
Don't lose hope, Iris,
we still have a few days to prepare.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.987
I know, but it's not like
we've come up with any new ideas

04:42.073 --> 04:43.109
for clearing Barry's name.

04:45.619 --> 04:48.327
A bigger issue is,
we don't seem to have Barry.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.991
Mrs. West-Allen.

04:50.081 --> 04:51.071
Warden Wolfe.

04:51.166 --> 04:52.407
Unfortunately, you won't be able to
see your husband today.

04:52.501 --> 04:53.617
He was in an altercation.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.996
What, an altercation?

04:55.086 --> 04:57.169
- A prison yard fight.
- What? Is he okay?

04:57.255 --> 04:58.416
He's fine. He's fine.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.214
He wasn't harmed and he wasn't at fault.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.711
But per Iron Heights protocol,

05:01.802 --> 05:04.089
everyone involved
is in isolation for the week.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.422
- And is he safe there?
- He couldn't be more safe.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.261
Actually,
it's a pretty common occurrence.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.681
<i>Safe until midnight.</i>

05:12.771 --> 05:15.388
<i>Then Allen and the others
belong to Amunet.</i>

05:15.774 --> 05:18.061
The important thing to know is,
he's in good hands.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.484
- You can rest easy at night.
- Thank you, Warden.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.402
Yes, thank you.

05:25.909 --> 05:27.116
What's wrong?

05:28.870 --> 05:30.577
Wolfe is trafficking meta-humans?

05:30.789 --> 05:32.405
Is everybody crooked in this town?

05:32.541 --> 05:35.579
Ah, he always did look smug
in those Italian wool suits.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.956
Oh, my God, he's literally a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

05:38.255 --> 05:39.541
It's kind of the perfect partnership.

05:39.631 --> 05:42.499
I mean, Amunet deals in metas
and Wolfe has a prison full of them.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.960
And him being the warden,
he can make some inmates disappear

05:46.137 --> 05:48.129
without raising any eyebrows.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.680
I'm gonna go talk to Singh.

05:49.766 --> 05:50.756
And say what?

05:51.393 --> 05:54.431
Your pregnant girlfriend with
gestational psychic powers told you?

05:54.521 --> 05:55.682
Joe, Singh's just gonna think

05:55.772 --> 05:57.934
that you're a father desperate
to get his son out of prison.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.640
Well, if we don't figure out
something before midnight,

05:59.734 --> 06:00.941
that's exactly what I'm gonna say.

06:01.027 --> 06:02.859
Hey, where's Harry? He can help.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.316
He went to Earth-2.
He's checking in on Jesse.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.568
So...

06:06.783 --> 06:07.773
Great.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.404
Okay, we're out of legal options,

06:09.494 --> 06:12.453
and Cisco can't breach Barry
out of the meta-wing,

06:12.539 --> 06:14.576
so how do we stop this?

06:15.333 --> 06:17.700
Hey, guys. Got your alert.
Sorry I'm late.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.751
- It's okay, Ralph.
- No, it's not okay.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.545
I ran into this old
business partner of mine.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.964
This guy, he's a big, fat creep.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.884
He's always sticking his nose
in my business.

06:27.971 --> 06:29.052
Oh, my.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.926
And he's so shady.

06:31.182 --> 06:33.925
He's got these beady eyes
and this crooked smile.

06:34.019 --> 06:36.636
He's just
a real two-faced rat from head to toe.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.392
- Well, freaky.
- What?

06:40.734 --> 06:42.316
He's a two-faced rat, he is.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.320
What's wrong with my voice?

06:47.449 --> 06:48.690
Do you hear that?

06:49.034 --> 06:50.150
Um...

06:53.496 --> 06:55.408
That's him, right there.

06:55.624 --> 06:58.958
That's him. Do you see him?
That's him. That's him! That's him!

06:59.377 --> 07:00.959
Right there.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.086
That's me.

07:06.343 --> 07:07.709
That's me.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.213
Why is that me?

07:09.387 --> 07:12.926
You somehow willed your body to
shape-shift into Earl's appearance.

07:13.016 --> 07:15.349
Seems like your cells can do
a lot more than just elongate.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.017
Ugh, brilliant!

07:17.145 --> 07:19.603
How do you undo it?
Undo this? That? This?

07:19.689 --> 07:20.975
Control Z?

07:21.066 --> 07:22.557
Control Z...

07:31.701 --> 07:34.284
Guys, I think I just figured out
how to stop Warden Wolfe.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.239
If Ralph could shape-shift
into Braveheart here,

07:37.332 --> 07:39.164
then he could easily
shape-shift into Wolfe

07:39.250 --> 07:40.616
and meet Amunet before midnight.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.043
And call off the whole deal
before it ever even happens.

07:43.129 --> 07:44.119
Right.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.248
I can call off what now?

07:52.430 --> 07:55.264
If he doesn't stop soon,
I'm gonna ask to be sold early.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.634
Being a meta-prisoner or a meta-pet,

07:57.894 --> 07:59.226
what's the difference?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.061
The difference is Amunet Black.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.932
She captures metas,
sells them to the highest bidder.

08:04.025 --> 08:06.608
Mob bosses, drug traffickers, gangs.

08:06.695 --> 08:10.063
Just imagine how our powers
could be used in the wrong hands.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.943
I ain't gonna be nobody's weapon.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.149
We gotta get out of here!

08:13.243 --> 08:14.984
Agreed. But how?

08:21.042 --> 08:23.500
Wolfe and Amunet's latest
criminal undertaking

08:24.045 --> 08:26.207
throws an annoying wrench in our plans.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.872
What shall we do?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.299
I don't know.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.962
You... You don't know?

08:35.807 --> 08:40.222
My mind is consumed by a near
infinite web of variables,

08:40.311 --> 08:43.554
more plentiful than there are atoms
in an exploding star.

08:43.648 --> 08:47.187
So, for the moment, I do not know.

08:47.902 --> 08:49.313
I fail to see the humor in this.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.483
I heard that. In your mind,

08:54.576 --> 08:57.910
a flash of stimuli racing through
your ventromedial prefrontal cortex

08:57.996 --> 09:01.239
where belief is formed. And doubt.

09:01.458 --> 09:02.915
I don't have any doubt.

09:03.126 --> 09:06.210
And if you had asked
instead of reading my mind,

09:07.088 --> 09:08.374
then you would know.

09:10.633 --> 09:11.919
I do know.

09:14.345 --> 09:18.259
As for your earlier inquiry,
it's not about what we're going to do.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.598
It's about what Barry Allen
is going to do.

09:56.805 --> 09:58.467
<i>Sitter, how goes it?</i>

10:00.433 --> 10:02.299
Hold your horses, almost done.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.362
Looks like the trap got clogged
with a bunch of hair.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.360
I'll head underneath,
make sure the stack is clear.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.903
- Good to go.
- Thank you.

10:37.887 --> 10:39.344
Okay, how's this?

10:40.181 --> 10:43.549
You know that painting in <i>IT,</i>
the one that comes to life?

10:43.643 --> 10:44.633
It's like that.

10:48.273 --> 10:49.855
This is impossible.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.400
We might as well just gift-wrap Barry,
hand him to Amunet and call it a day.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.024
No, Ralph, this is not impossible.

10:56.114 --> 10:58.902
Your polymerized cells
are linked to your thoughts.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.780
You should be able to change
into anyone you can think of.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.408
Just like when you squeezed
your belly into abs.

11:04.497 --> 11:07.285
Okay, first off,
I have been working out.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.957
This is au naturel now.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.579
And second, that was just some abs.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.336
This is an entire person.

11:13.214 --> 11:17.549
Look, when I first learned how to vibe,

11:18.094 --> 11:21.337
I had to learn how to clear my mind
of all other thoughts.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.888
You think you can do that?

11:24.475 --> 11:27.388
Okay, uh, all right. I'll try.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.310
Do better than "try"!

11:29.397 --> 11:32.265
Barry's life is in your hands,
and we're all counting on you.

11:35.195 --> 11:37.528
I think what you meant to say was,
"No pressure, Ralphy."

11:37.614 --> 11:41.153
- Here we go!
- All right. Focus. Be Wolfe.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.528
Be the Wolfe.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.363
Big, bad Wolfe.

11:56.633 --> 11:59.967
Oh, wow, sweet chiseled cheekbones,
I did it.

12:00.470 --> 12:02.962
Wow, maybe I can save Barry.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.297
Oh, uh-oh.

12:08.311 --> 12:09.927
Uh, a little help?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.471
Next, we need to
work on his motor skills.

12:50.144 --> 12:51.851
Well done, boy.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.600
And hey, for the record,

12:53.690 --> 12:57.229
I was already planning on making
that stuff that you used, so...

12:57.318 --> 12:59.526
Sure, right after your lunch tray
crowbar method.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.109
Can we continue on with the breaking
and exiting, please?

13:02.198 --> 13:04.281
You want us to follow a cop
on a prison break?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.700
I'm not a cop in here. I'm a prisoner.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.699
And I'm not about to let Amunet
turn me into a weaponized slave.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.405
- Are you?
- Okay.

13:11.499 --> 13:13.741
- You convinced me. Let's go.
- I'm staying.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.622
What? Why?

13:15.712 --> 13:17.829
Because I don't wanna hurt anyone else.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.545
Last time I was out there,
I almost destroyed the whole city.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.968
- Yeah, she can stay.
- No, we're all leaving.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.719
Becky, if Amunet sells you,

13:28.808 --> 13:31.141
your powers will be used
to hurt a lot of people.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.311
The only way to prevent that
is to escape with us.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.022
Please, trust me.

13:40.320 --> 13:43.358
Yay, one big happy. Now what?

13:45.158 --> 13:48.902
Wolfe said that this wing
was built on top of the old prison.

13:50.955 --> 13:54.369
I also heard the plumber talking
about piping underneath us.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.745
Once we're far enough away
from the meta-wing,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.250
we'll get our powers back.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.083
That's how we get our freedom.

14:19.233 --> 14:20.769
Ew...

14:22.653 --> 14:23.643
My bad, tiny.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.400
Hey, as soon as we get out,

14:25.490 --> 14:27.356
I'll steal you
a brand-new pair of Timmy Choos.

14:28.493 --> 14:31.031
It's Jimmy. I'm size six.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.237
You're so sweet.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.239
If you want to use your powers
for something useful,

14:35.333 --> 14:37.700
you can help me steal back
some native artifacts.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.285
If you two plan on going back to crime,

14:39.379 --> 14:40.745
you might as well just turn around.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.081
Flash will just run you back here.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.415
Same goes for all of you.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.671
Don't look at me, I'm reformed.

14:46.761 --> 14:48.753
From now on I only commit legal crime.

14:48.930 --> 14:50.091
"Legal crime"?

14:50.264 --> 14:53.098
- The stock market.
- Come on. We have a long way to go.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.845
Augmentation is complete.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.522
Your chair will serve its purpose.

15:01.609 --> 15:05.148
You have outdone yourself once again.

15:12.203 --> 15:16.322
<i>Well, I think I'm going
out of my head...</i>

15:16.416 --> 15:17.827
That melody in your head...

15:20.086 --> 15:21.122
You don't recognize it?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.959
- It was playing...
- The first time we danced.

15:25.466 --> 15:26.456
Yes.

15:26.551 --> 15:27.917
So you do remember.

15:28.010 --> 15:32.345
June 27th, 1997 at 8:13 p.m.

15:33.182 --> 15:36.516
In the countryside
in the small hamlet of Boars Hill.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.265
That was also the first time we kissed.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.521
And the first time I realized

15:41.607 --> 15:43.599
I wanted to spend
the rest of my life by your side.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.437
Marlize, I forget nothing.

15:49.574 --> 15:54.865
Perhaps our song was once
at the forefront of my consciousness,

15:54.954 --> 15:56.866
but now...

15:58.166 --> 16:00.658
<i>Think I'm going out of my head</i>

16:02.378 --> 16:05.917
That song playing in your head makes
it difficult to read your thoughts.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.131
Quite difficult.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.091
Perhaps that's on purpose.

16:10.344 --> 16:11.630
Of course not.

16:13.055 --> 16:14.216
Of course not.

16:16.517 --> 16:21.433
I know this unforeseen change
concerns you,

16:21.522 --> 16:22.888
but fear not.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.316
Once this next phase is complete,

16:28.029 --> 16:30.692
I will erase every doubt from your head.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.910
Wolfe-man to S.T.A.R.
- base, I'm in.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.873
Ralph, to help you stay as Wolfe,
I'm gonna hand you over to Joe, okay?

16:48.966 --> 16:50.457
He's gonna quarterback.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.543
- Ralph, you copy?
- Yep.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.670
So what's the next move?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.301
Preferably something
without a lot of moving.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.348
Okay, Amunet's point man is Norvok,

16:59.435 --> 17:00.767
so you're gonna have to
talk to him first.

17:01.103 --> 17:03.516
Grab a drink. Act like a hard-ass.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.722
Barkeep?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.683
Something cold and frosty,
if you please.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.392
Jeez.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.190
That's on you, bro.

17:20.915 --> 17:23.406
Snake's on the brain. Five o'clock.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.914
Stay focused, Ralph.
No distracting thoughts.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.203
Gingold on the rocks.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.872
Hand it to me, please.

17:31.926 --> 17:33.292
What the hell are you doing here?

17:34.262 --> 17:38.723
I'd like to talk to Amunet, please,
about the deal.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.468
You can talk to Amunet at the deal.

17:43.604 --> 17:46.563
Damn it, Ralph.
Nobody talks to Wolfe like that.

17:46.649 --> 17:48.891
<i>He's the warden of the most
dangerous prison in the Midwest.</i>

17:49.026 --> 17:50.016
Demand some respect.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.688
Listen, you lapdog.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.447
Set up the meeting with your boss, now.

17:56.534 --> 17:59.151
Or I'll pull out your eye snake
and strangle you with it, understood?

17:59.245 --> 18:00.986
All right. All right.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.580
Let me see what I can do.

18:15.261 --> 18:16.502
Oh, God.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.137
- Sup?
- Ralph, are you okay?

18:23.352 --> 18:24.809
Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah.

18:25.021 --> 18:26.307
No problem here.

18:26.981 --> 18:30.224
I'm definitely holding it together.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.731
Yeah, that doesn't sound too convincing.

18:32.903 --> 18:34.769
I have complete control
of the situation.

18:35.197 --> 18:37.405
<i>Ol' Dibny won't let his friends down.</i>

18:39.619 --> 18:40.655
Wolfe.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.784
Amunet's ready.

18:48.044 --> 18:49.455
Then let's not keep her waiting.

18:52.465 --> 18:54.548
Are you sure this is the right way?

18:54.967 --> 18:57.254
You hear the water in this sewer drain?

18:57.428 --> 18:58.885
It's moving in this direction.

18:59.180 --> 19:01.547
We keep going this way,
we'll head away from the prison,

19:01.641 --> 19:02.757
find our exit.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.058
Wow, good catch.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.553
You must have been a really smart CSI.

19:08.230 --> 19:11.314
A CSI who killed a teacher
in his own apartment,

19:11.400 --> 19:13.107
and left evidence everywhere.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.652
Yeah, doesn't sound so smart to me.

19:15.738 --> 19:17.525
Hey, speaking of,
maybe we shouldn't be...

19:20.493 --> 19:21.859
Crap.

19:22.161 --> 19:24.448
Hey, easy! Easy. Rundine.

19:24.538 --> 19:25.699
Easy.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.452
If we let him go, he will out us.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.908
- We can't do that, can we?
- Deacon...

19:30.544 --> 19:32.251
What are you doing?
No, we can't hurt him!

19:32.338 --> 19:34.295
We have to do more than hurt him.
We don't have a choice.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.840
No. Hey, we do not have to kill him.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.167
Yes, we do.

19:41.722 --> 19:44.430
No, we don't.
All right, just duct-tape him.

19:45.226 --> 19:46.683
Come on, let's move.

19:51.232 --> 19:52.848
It looked like it hurt.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.017
Ding, ding.

19:56.112 --> 20:00.527
Boys, have some orange slices.
Mommy needs to work, okay?

20:01.158 --> 20:02.524
Warden.

20:02.952 --> 20:06.662
I'm going to assume this is not
one of those good emergency meetings.

20:06.956 --> 20:11.041
A few hours before
major criminal undertaking.

20:11.127 --> 20:12.868
- We have to delay the deal.
- What?

20:13.713 --> 20:15.921
My ears outside tell me
the police have been tipped.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.122
I don't know how.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.799
Maybe CCPD hacked into the cameras.

20:20.428 --> 20:22.590
You said there were no cameras.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.012
- I did?
- Mmm...

20:24.098 --> 20:26.215
Yes, I did say that.

20:26.308 --> 20:29.892
But then, afterwards, I installed a few.

20:32.398 --> 20:33.855
- Did you?
- Mmm.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.224
Hmm...

20:37.820 --> 20:43.236
Something seems off
with the big, bad Wolfe.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.614
If you even are Wolfe.

20:46.954 --> 20:48.820
Stay in it. She's testing you.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.080
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.949
I'm the same man
you've always dealt with.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.586
Okay. And who would that be?

20:56.839 --> 20:58.831
The one who gives you your merchandise.

20:59.508 --> 21:00.919
And trust me,

21:01.010 --> 21:02.876
you need me a lot more than I need you.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.713
So when I say
the deal has to be delayed,

21:05.806 --> 21:08.640
it's because the deal has to be delayed.

21:10.728 --> 21:11.844
Okay.

21:17.568 --> 21:18.854
What the hell?

21:21.864 --> 21:22.854
What?

21:23.032 --> 21:25.991
You know, sometimes I hate
being right all the time.

21:26.368 --> 21:27.654
Ralph, get out of there.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.952
Uh...

21:37.713 --> 21:38.874
Damn it!

21:46.138 --> 21:48.425
Get me Wolfe, yeah?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.099
I understand your concern, Amunet,

21:52.186 --> 21:53.768
but you have my word.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.891
Your metas are exactly
where they're supposed to be.

21:56.357 --> 21:58.599
Locked up tightly in their cells,
waiting for you to claim them.

22:00.236 --> 22:03.400
Very good. I'll see you then.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.231
Find them!

22:12.498 --> 22:15.206
I mean, there has to be another way.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.624
There isn't.

22:17.461 --> 22:19.373
There is one card left to play.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.797
Go to Iron Heights
and stop the deal before it happens.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.465
You're talking about finding Amunet,

22:24.552 --> 22:27.636
plus a prison full of
armed meta-guards on their turf.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.257
This is the only option we have left.

22:31.517 --> 22:32.553
You guys can do this.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.014
Let's go.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.140
Ralph.

22:36.939 --> 22:39.431
Yeah, maybe not this time.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.891
What, why?

22:41.318 --> 22:44.402
Look, you're gonna have a better
chance saving Barry without me.

22:44.947 --> 22:46.313
Ralph, you know that isn't true.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.690
I just screwed everything up.

22:48.909 --> 22:50.696
You know what could happen
if I screw it up again?

22:50.786 --> 22:51.902
You won't.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.828
Okay, you know what?
Maybe we just need to talk this out.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.325
Let's go visit with Dr. Hallway.
Come on.

22:55.624 --> 22:57.331
Look, talk's not gonna fix my head.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.794
I just can't do it this time, guys.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.914
Sorry I let you down.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.086
Hey! Hey, Ralph!

23:14.435 --> 23:16.552
Looks like we're finally
in the old prison.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.931
We must be close.

23:18.355 --> 23:19.721
Maybe closer than we think.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.272
I know this lock.

23:21.358 --> 23:23.600
It's the same kind they use
in the general population wing.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.227
Which means there are no meta-dampeners

23:25.404 --> 23:26.565
on the other side of this door.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.064
We get through, we get our powers back.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.492
Well, that's all I needed to hear.

23:32.828 --> 23:34.239
Out of the way.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.827
You good?

23:39.209 --> 23:40.871
No brains, no brawn.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.418
Allow me.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.417
I may not have my powers...

23:48.302 --> 23:51.636
But I don't need them
to hack my way out of trouble.

23:52.431 --> 23:53.797
Give me a few minutes.

23:54.516 --> 23:55.506
Come here.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.888
I'm fine. It doesn't really hurt.

23:58.103 --> 23:59.184
Are you sure?

23:59.688 --> 24:02.021
- I mean, it hurts a little.
- Yeah, come here.

24:03.901 --> 24:05.858
- There.
- Thanks.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.902
Guess I forgot what it feels like

24:07.988 --> 24:09.945
to punch someone in the face
without my powers.

24:10.240 --> 24:12.653
Judging by the swelling,
I'd say

24:12.743 --> 24:17.283
you have a fracture on either
the fourth or fifth metacarpal.

24:18.165 --> 24:21.579
I used to fall down a lot. Super klutz.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.254
So what are you gonna do
when you're free?

24:26.507 --> 24:28.544
I hope it's not more of what you did
to get you in here.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.633
Oh, no, trust me.

24:30.803 --> 24:34.092
I am so over prison jumpsuits.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.849
Orange is not the new anything.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.469
Neither is gray. Neither is gray. So...

24:41.021 --> 24:42.557
So, what then?

24:43.065 --> 24:44.431
I don't know.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.810
Using my powers
just hurt those around me.

24:47.903 --> 24:51.567
My good luck just jinxed everyone else.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.743
You know, you seem to really care
about people.

24:57.871 --> 25:03.868
Not like the type of person
who'd take someone's life.

25:05.421 --> 25:07.128
I didn't kill that teacher.

25:08.173 --> 25:09.709
I wouldn't take a life.

25:11.802 --> 25:14.761
You know, not every meta
uses their powers to hurt people.

25:14.847 --> 25:18.716
Some use them to help others,
to protect people.

25:19.268 --> 25:21.760
Our powers don't decide who we are.

25:22.563 --> 25:23.553
We do.

25:28.652 --> 25:31.360
Ralph? Hey, Ralph, you in here?

25:33.490 --> 25:36.654
Ugh, the light, it burns.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.448
All right, come on. Time to get up.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.579
I can't. I'm dead.

25:41.957 --> 25:43.414
Okay, I don't know
what's going on with you,

25:43.500 --> 25:45.537
but I'm betting it has something
to do with the reason

25:45.627 --> 25:47.539
you literally fell apart at the bar.

25:47.629 --> 25:50.997
I told Cisco that a talk from him
is not going to help.

25:51.091 --> 25:54.129
So a talk from you
is not going to help either, Caitlin.

25:55.262 --> 25:56.423
Okay.

25:57.014 --> 25:58.425
I'll get somebody else.

25:59.767 --> 26:00.848
Hey.

26:15.657 --> 26:17.273
Hello, stretch.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.408
They call me "man who elongates" now.

26:20.287 --> 26:22.574
Hmm. They should call you pathetic.

26:24.374 --> 26:26.491
So you screwed up, get over it.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.410
You are a mean lady.

26:28.504 --> 26:30.416
I'm just telling you
what you need to hear.

26:30.506 --> 26:32.372
Yeah, well, I'm not gonna miss you
when you leave.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.379
"Leave"? Is that what this is about?

26:35.844 --> 26:37.130
Well, yeah.

26:37.262 --> 26:38.844
Everybody leaves Ralph Dibny eventually.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.297
That's how this whole thing works.

26:40.724 --> 26:43.558
I screw up big time and they take off.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.434
This time, the people
who are gonna leave

26:49.525 --> 26:51.517
are actually my friends.

26:52.903 --> 26:55.520
They're the first ones that I've had
in a really long time.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.647
That's stupid.

26:58.075 --> 26:59.657
Yeah, well, I wouldn't
expect you to understand.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.234
You kidnap and stab all your friends.

27:01.328 --> 27:04.196
Right, I'm the queen of letting
these people down.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.823
But you know what, they're still here.

27:06.917 --> 27:10.957
No matter how much I disappoint them,
they still show up for me.

27:11.046 --> 27:12.457
I don't really understand it,

27:12.548 --> 27:14.710
but I think it's part of this
whole friends thing.

27:15.551 --> 27:20.842
So, unless you do something worse
than kidnap and stab them,

27:21.056 --> 27:22.718
I think you're gonna be just fine.

27:23.016 --> 27:25.224
- You really think so?
- Yes, I do.

27:26.186 --> 27:27.176
Huh.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.056
You know, that
actually wasn't a bad pep talk.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.434
Well, it's your turn next time.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.440
If I ever decide
to go full villain again,

27:36.530 --> 27:38.237
you can give me the lame heart-to-heart.

27:39.032 --> 27:40.364
"Full villain."

27:41.034 --> 27:42.570
Wait.

27:43.412 --> 27:45.028
Wait.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.909
I know how to fix this!

27:48.375 --> 27:50.332
I gotta see a girl about a guy.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.126
Thank you, Frosty Oprah.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.011
Presto.

28:09.271 --> 28:10.432
Everyone's powers work?

28:13.567 --> 28:14.648
Yep.

28:14.902 --> 28:15.892
Ah...

28:17.404 --> 28:20.943
I can smell all the tech
within five miles of here.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.574
Thank you, Barry. You saved us.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.780
You did good, boy.

28:28.290 --> 28:29.872
Not good enough, it seems.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.508
Everyone back inside
and you'll live to see another day.

28:40.594 --> 28:42.210
I think the only one
who should be worried about

28:42.304 --> 28:43.715
surviving right now is you.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.562
There's no cavalry.

28:53.857 --> 28:56.019
No one's gonna see what happened here.

28:56.109 --> 28:59.022
It's just you and us, Wolfe.

28:59.863 --> 29:02.571
You want revenge? Understandable.

29:02.741 --> 29:03.948
Just one thing.

29:04.409 --> 29:08.653
If you're thirsty for vengeance,
you might wanna start with the Flash.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.666
Barry Allen is the Flash.

29:13.752 --> 29:16.210
The same man who put you behind bars,

29:16.296 --> 29:18.663
and who will no doubt
recapture you after you escape.

29:19.800 --> 29:22.167
That was probably his plan
all along.

29:22.511 --> 29:23.501
Is all that true?

29:24.596 --> 29:27.304
I'm gonna squash you so quick,
you won't even know what hit you.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.053
No, not quick.

29:31.311 --> 29:33.644
Let's take our time.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.643
The Flash on his knees.

29:37.567 --> 29:39.729
I suppose there is justice after all.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.025
Let's see how fast he can run
when he's the size of a flea.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.698
Stop! Stop!

29:46.410 --> 29:47.446
What are you doing, runt?

29:48.036 --> 29:49.322
Deciding who I am.

29:50.539 --> 29:51.871
You're not gonna hurt him.

29:52.374 --> 29:54.707
Join us or get out of the way.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.454
Either way, we're taking him.

29:58.422 --> 30:00.789
Good luck with that.

30:23.196 --> 30:24.186
Told ya.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.992
Shoot to wound.
They're no good to me dead.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.278
They most certainly are not.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.788
Amunet. You're early.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.709
And you are exactly as I suspected.
A liar.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.207
Who's obviously in way over his head.

30:40.505 --> 30:41.791
But no matter,

30:42.215 --> 30:44.127
I will clean up your mess for you.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.296
Step aside, boys.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.927
Mommy needs to work.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.092
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.848
Not again.

31:01.109 --> 31:02.099
Oh.

31:12.037 --> 31:13.198
DeVoe...

31:14.748 --> 31:17.081
Oh, I don't pay me enough for this.

31:25.884 --> 31:27.125
My powers won't work.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.252
Mine either.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.303
He must have blasted us with something.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.676
Who the hell are you?

31:33.183 --> 31:34.924
I am your destiny.

31:51.576 --> 31:53.033
No!

32:03.672 --> 32:05.664
Help me.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.720
Too late, Mr. Allen.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.608
Oh, what an inconspicuous body.

32:26.778 --> 32:29.145
This will be quite useful.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.577
<i>Not so fast, Warden.</i>

32:44.379 --> 32:45.495
You won't take my body.

32:45.714 --> 32:47.205
I don't want your body.

32:48.758 --> 32:49.748
I want your life.

33:04.316 --> 33:07.104
Goodbye for now, Mr. Allen.

33:30.258 --> 33:31.499
What happened?

33:32.719 --> 33:34.255
DeVoe.

33:34.888 --> 33:36.595
Well, the party's over.

33:39.059 --> 33:40.766
Let's get the hell out of here.

33:41.603 --> 33:42.593
I'm staying.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.845
What? Barry.

33:45.065 --> 33:47.273
I was only willing to do this,

33:47.359 --> 33:48.566
trying to break everybody out,

33:48.652 --> 33:49.938
because Wolfe was gonna sell us.

33:50.028 --> 33:52.315
But that's not gonna happen now.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.484
I'm staying.

33:55.158 --> 33:57.115
Until you find a way to
get me out of here legally.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.449
It's the only way I'd ever
really feel free, you know that.

34:02.207 --> 34:03.994
This could be our only chance
to save you.

34:05.293 --> 34:06.750
We all have to decide who we are.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.496
This is who I am.

34:17.097 --> 34:18.257
<i>Prison breach.</i>

34:18.348 --> 34:19.714
<i>Breakout in progress.</i>

34:20.350 --> 34:21.931
<i>Engage lockdown.</i>

34:23.520 --> 34:25.476
<i>Code Xprison breach.</i>

34:25.563 --> 34:27.851
<i>Repeat, we have a Code X.</i>

34:27.940 --> 34:29.226
Move, move, move!

34:29.985 --> 34:31.647
Stand against the wall!

34:33.905 --> 34:35.112
Cell block secure.

35:12.235 --> 35:14.067
New evidence, Ms. Horton.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.238
That's what you told this court
had come into your possession.

35:17.532 --> 35:19.945
Only I haven't heard it or seen it,

35:20.035 --> 35:23.619
nor have the circumstances changed
in any way that would convince me

35:23.705 --> 35:25.162
to move for a retrial.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.453
So unless you have
something more to add,

35:28.793 --> 35:30.876
this appeal hearing is over.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.828
I understand,
Your Honor, I do.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.710
If we could just wait
a few more minutes,

35:35.800 --> 35:38.838
- I am sure that...
- I am tired of waiting.

35:39.012 --> 35:42.050
Either you have something new to add
or you don't.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.056
Which is it?

35:47.937 --> 35:49.394
We have nothing further, Your Honor.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.599
Then I hereby deem
Barry Allen's appeal...

35:53.234 --> 35:54.350
Wait...

36:03.286 --> 36:04.322
DeVoe?

36:04.412 --> 36:05.778
Nope. Not DeVoe.

36:06.414 --> 36:07.996
It's Ralph.

36:08.249 --> 36:11.583
I believe you are looking for me,
Your Honor.

36:14.214 --> 36:16.456
I don't know how any of this happened.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.962
You were found in Barry Allen's loft.

36:19.052 --> 36:21.260
- You were dead.
- I was stabbed.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.595
I heard a voice saying
something about framing someone.

36:26.851 --> 36:27.967
- Then I blacked out.
- It's gonna work.

36:28.395 --> 36:31.559
And this morning,
I woke up in my own home.

36:32.732 --> 36:35.975
Mrs. DeVoe, does any of this
make any sense to you?

36:36.695 --> 36:37.856
No.

36:37.946 --> 36:41.155
I am just as surprised by all of this
as everyone.

36:43.076 --> 36:45.784
Your Honor, the city has had
reports in the past

36:45.870 --> 36:48.954
of people who have appeared dead

36:49.040 --> 36:51.578
only to later emerge very much alive.

36:51.960 --> 36:52.950
That's impossible.

36:53.044 --> 36:57.288
"Impossible"?
Your Honor, is it as impossible as

36:57.382 --> 36:59.840
a man who can run faster than
the speed of sound?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.508
I submit that Central City is home
to the impossible.

37:05.598 --> 37:09.342
I have as many questions as
you have, Your Honor.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.094
And I am looking forward

37:11.187 --> 37:14.555
to working with the authorities
to solve this mystery.

37:15.233 --> 37:18.852
Yes, I'm sure that CCPD
will be very interested in this.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.943
And as for Barry Allen's appeal...

37:27.245 --> 37:29.077
I guess the court must deem that

37:30.039 --> 37:32.531
Clifford DeVoe is alive and well.

37:32.667 --> 37:34.954
Barry Allen is hereby cleared
of all charges

37:35.044 --> 37:36.660
and ordered released from

37:36.755 --> 37:39.247
Iron Heights Penitentiary immediately.

37:54.314 --> 37:56.226
- You're home.
- You're my home.

38:00.069 --> 38:01.560
Aw. He couldn't wait to do that.

38:01.654 --> 38:02.940
How you feeling, Barry? You doin' okay?

38:03.031 --> 38:04.147
I'm feeling great, Dad.

38:04.282 --> 38:06.114
Well, you look like
you can use a good meal.

38:06.326 --> 38:08.864
And don't you worry,
I made a fresh batch

38:08.953 --> 38:12.071
of Grandma Esther's meatloaf.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.656
- Oh, yeah.
- Just like you like it.

38:13.750 --> 38:15.161
Meatloaf? Gross.

38:16.419 --> 38:20.163
I just meant meatloaf is a grossly
undervalued menu item

38:20.256 --> 38:21.963
in most restaurants, I think.

38:22.258 --> 38:24.671
You guys, now that I'm free,
I don't care what I do.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.756
I'm just so happy
to be back with all of you again.

38:27.806 --> 38:28.922
Team Flash.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.426
Today, we celebrate Barry.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.013
Tomorrow, we go back to
stopping the man that framed you.

38:38.566 --> 38:39.556
I'll drink to that.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.641
Hear, hear.

38:44.072 --> 38:45.062
You okay, Barry?

38:47.700 --> 38:49.612
Yeah, it's DeVoe.

38:49.911 --> 38:51.573
Barry, we're gonna stop him.
I know we will.

38:51.871 --> 38:53.328
No, that's not it. He...

38:54.582 --> 38:56.039
There was nothing keeping him

38:56.125 --> 38:59.539
from going inside the meta-wing
and absorbing the powers

38:59.629 --> 39:01.245
of every meta in Iron Heights.

39:02.215 --> 39:04.502
Peek-a-Boo, Top, Weather Wizard...

39:04.843 --> 39:07.961
I mean, he could have stolen
their powers and more, but he didn't.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.929
He only wants the bus metas,

39:11.975 --> 39:14.718
he wants their powers for something,
all of them.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.052
We know a bus meta.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.231
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

39:21.317 --> 39:23.684
Just couldn't get this left glute
to shape-shift back to

39:23.778 --> 39:25.064
its normal perky...

39:27.740 --> 39:29.481
Why is everyone looking at me
like I'm a dead man?

39:38.668 --> 39:39.704
What's all this?

39:40.879 --> 39:47.001
After last night's success,
I thought a toast was in order.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.423
"Success"? Is that what
you call last night?

39:50.513 --> 39:52.425
Yes. How would you describe it?

39:55.643 --> 39:56.975
Barry Allen was...

39:58.146 --> 40:01.105
Supposed to remain in
the meta-human wing at Iron Heights.

40:02.442 --> 40:04.399
But he's now free.

40:05.320 --> 40:09.155
Even Team Flash has good luck sometimes.

40:09.449 --> 40:10.565
And the bus metas?

40:10.658 --> 40:13.071
We were supposed to wait
till all of them were captured.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.618
But you only got four.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.867
I said I would retrieve them
from confinement.

40:18.750 --> 40:22.084
I never said when or where.

40:27.675 --> 40:31.259
There is something else on your mind,
isn't there?

40:32.138 --> 40:33.254
Warden Wolfe's death.

40:33.348 --> 40:34.839
