00:20.020 --> 00:25.442
<i>Love is crucial.</i>

00:27.068 --> 00:31.531
<i>If we don't have love,</i>
<i>it's difficult to work well.</i>

00:31.614 --> 00:35.201
<i>And in the kitchen,</i>
<i>that is extremely important.</i>

00:36.745 --> 00:41.499
When one is loved,
she can create better.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.632
<i>There is more passion.</i>

00:53.052 --> 00:55.638
<i>More beautiful thoughts.</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:02.020
<i>Because of love we do nice things,</i>

01:02.103 --> 01:03.897
<i>and because of love,</i>

01:03.980 --> 01:07.192
<i>sometimes we create catastrophes.</i>

05:14.814 --> 05:16.607
Two peaches, right away.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.026
Yes.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.663
Don't let so much time pass in between.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.374
You need to think in advance, Maja.

05:41.424 --> 05:45.720
Look, Maja. Did you add salt?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.597
<i>I never went to cooking school,</i>

07:11.681 --> 07:15.643
<i>and that's why I discovered</i>
<i>my own way of creating,</i>

07:15.726 --> 07:17.979
<i>which is less restrictive.</i>

07:20.481 --> 07:23.860
<i>Upon first sight, you think,</i>
<i>"Do I even like this?"</i>

07:23.943 --> 07:27.155
<i>But when you put it in your mouth,</i>

07:27.238 --> 07:29.449
<i>the world completely changes.</i>

07:32.577 --> 07:36.706
<i>I'm proud of my audacity.</i>

07:39.459 --> 07:42.753
The only thing that I don't like
to hear from my guests

07:42.837 --> 07:45.256
is that the dinner was boring.

07:45.339 --> 07:50.970
<i>That might be the biggest criticism</i>
<i>I could ever receive.</i>

07:55.391 --> 07:59.812
Have you put the collar on Prince?

07:59.937 --> 08:03.232
Are we ready? Okay, let's go.

08:04.484 --> 08:07.445
Eva, why is your bag so heavy?
Svit, close the door.

08:07.528 --> 08:10.156
Oh, these shoes of yours.

08:11.866 --> 08:16.162
<i>Hiša Franko is not just my kitchen.</i>

08:23.044 --> 08:27.632
<i>It's also our home.</i>

08:31.677 --> 08:35.848
Hiša Franko is led by two people.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.684
On one side there's me and my kitchen.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.569
<i>And on the other side is Valter</i>

08:48.653 --> 08:52.156
<i>and his wine cellar.</i>

09:13.970 --> 09:16.764
Valter is also my husband.

09:16.847 --> 09:20.851
This is a true partnership
24 hours a day.

09:24.939 --> 09:28.067
<i>Ana and I have been together</i>
<i>for more than 20 years.</i>

09:28.150 --> 09:31.571
<i>I've known her cuisine</i>
<i>since the beginning.</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:37.326
We have been together for so many years
that none of her dishes surprise me.

09:39.704 --> 09:40.955
Hey.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.794
Superb.
I think we'll get drunk just like this.

09:49.797 --> 09:54.302
And here's the mackerel.
Let's try it first.

09:55.344 --> 10:01.726
<i>When we were tasting wines</i>
<i>to pair with new dishes...</i>

10:02.643 --> 10:05.229
<i>I thought of three bottles</i>

10:05.354 --> 10:09.942
from my cellar that matched perfectly.

10:12.028 --> 10:18.701
<i>The flavor of food is enhanced</i>
<i>by the flavor of wine and vice versa.</i>

10:18.784 --> 10:22.246
They give each other energy.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.514
<i>I'm a child of a rural doctor.</i>

11:25.684 --> 11:29.105
<i>In the countryside,</i>
<i>doctors are important people.</i>

11:38.739 --> 11:42.743
My father and I were...
are very attached to each other.

11:46.205 --> 11:48.582
<i>When growing up,</i>

11:48.666 --> 11:53.671
<i>your parents are your first true love.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:58.008
We had a beautiful
father-daughter relationship.

12:04.932 --> 12:09.520
My father strived for me
to get an education.

12:09.603 --> 12:11.188
To be somebody.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.193
<i>She was a very good skier.</i>

12:16.277 --> 12:21.615
<i>She was a member</i>
<i>of the youth national team of Yugoslavia.</i>

12:22.950 --> 12:27.204
She would come home late from practice,

12:27.288 --> 12:31.584
<i>and get up at 5:00 a.m.</i>
<i>and get ready for school.</i>

12:31.667 --> 12:35.421
<i>That was how it was every day for her.</i>

12:39.884 --> 12:45.347
Even while balancing
sports and demanding activities,

12:45.431 --> 12:50.686
<i>she was an excellent student.</i>

12:52.938 --> 12:56.358
<i>She studied international relations.</i>

12:57.943 --> 13:02.948
<i>We were all expecting that she would</i>
<i>end up as a professional diplomat.</i>

13:05.034 --> 13:06.994
I was put under more and more pressure

13:07.077 --> 13:09.788
from practice, competition
and high expectations.

13:12.166 --> 13:15.544
<i>But when somebody puts</i>
<i>all that on your plate,</i>

13:15.628 --> 13:17.421
<i>it's really difficult.</i>

13:18.422 --> 13:20.716
<i>It doesn't allow any creativity.</i>

13:41.195 --> 13:43.614
Look, mint.

13:59.880 --> 14:01.590
-Knock, knock, knock.
-Hello!

14:01.674 --> 14:03.926
-Hello.
-Hello.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.555
You are finally here!
We are just making coffee.

14:08.472 --> 14:11.016
Coffee! Coffee and milk.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.562
Okay, I will drink some brandy instead.

14:14.645 --> 14:17.273
The first thing you have to do
when you come to the mountains

14:17.356 --> 14:18.566
is to take a shot of brandy.

14:21.068 --> 14:26.574
Shots at 7:00 a.m.? That is a good day.

14:29.743 --> 14:34.248
You need to drink all at once!

14:41.255 --> 14:45.509
<i>During my fourth year of college,</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:47.011
<i>I was on break.</i>

14:47.845 --> 14:53.100
My mom forced me to join her for dinner.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.354
<i>We went to Hiša Franko.</i>

15:00.566 --> 15:04.361
<i>I was working there as a waiter.</i>

15:05.362 --> 15:10.075
<i>They were sitting at the table,</i>
<i>and I could tell she was really bored.</i>

15:10.159 --> 15:13.537
So I invited her
for a glass of wine at the bar.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.458
<i>We found each other interesting.</i>

15:17.541 --> 15:21.003
<i>After that,</i>
<i>we started seeing each other and...</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:24.173
<i>we fell in love.</i>

15:25.966 --> 15:28.594
<i>Soon after that I moved in with him.</i>

15:30.429 --> 15:32.890
These things happen fast
when they are real.

15:36.393 --> 15:39.521
<i>We traveled the world</i>
<i>and got to know new continents,</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:42.274
<i>new flavors, new wines.</i>

15:45.569 --> 15:49.198
<i>We were making our wishes come true.</i>

15:50.115 --> 15:52.701
<i>And that made us very happy.</i>

15:52.785 --> 15:54.411
<i>It lifted our spirits.</i>

15:56.080 --> 16:00.668
<i>This way of living had</i>
<i>a deep effect on me.</i>

16:00.751 --> 16:02.586
<i>It changed me.</i>

16:04.630 --> 16:08.050
<i>In a way, I grew up by his side.</i>

16:11.220 --> 16:16.392
<i>I was discovering completely</i>
<i>new foreign countries.</i>

16:16.475 --> 16:18.769
<i>And it seemed that</i>

16:18.852 --> 16:24.274
<i>my path was to leave everything</i>
<i>from my childhood behind.</i>

16:27.111 --> 16:28.654
<i>I realized that...</i>

16:29.571 --> 16:32.324
<i>living surrounded by rules</i>

16:32.408 --> 16:35.619
<i>can feel very restrictive.</i>

16:38.372 --> 16:42.167
<i>It's freedom that defines you.</i>

16:58.183 --> 17:02.271
<i>Being aware of local tradition</i>

17:02.354 --> 17:06.900
is the basis on which a chef should
build their creations.

17:09.361 --> 17:12.489
<i>These are harsh living conditions.</i>

17:12.573 --> 17:17.870
<i>The farmers work very hard to survive.</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:34.094
They're arranged by date.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.681
There's a date on top
and then they go by age.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.476
How long do you keep them here?

17:40.559 --> 17:42.936
For four weeks.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.150
<i>In this very modest region,</i>
<i>they didn't have refrigerators</i>

17:48.233 --> 17:52.488
<i>or cold places for storing.</i>

17:54.948 --> 18:01.163
<i>The cheese doesn't get</i>
<i>the opportunity to be aged.</i>

18:02.206 --> 18:07.252
The Tolmin cheese is one of the most
beautiful expressions of our environment.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.760
This is why our decision

18:14.843 --> 18:18.597
<i>to age the cheese is so important.</i>

18:19.515 --> 18:24.895
<i>I'd never come across</i>
<i>anyone in the valley or in Slovenia</i>

18:24.978 --> 18:26.605
who was aging cheese.

18:29.066 --> 18:33.487
<i>So I started aging this cheese</i>
<i>in my cellar.</i>

18:37.199 --> 18:43.163
<i>I nurtured it, turned it,</i>
<i>cleaned it, washed it.</i>

18:46.291 --> 18:49.294
<i>I realized it was best after three years.</i>

18:54.716 --> 18:58.011
<i>When you take a bite...</i>

18:58.095 --> 19:00.597
the flavor overwhelms your mouth.

19:02.850 --> 19:06.728
<i>Three-year-old Tolmin cheese</i>
<i>is an exceptional cheese.</i>

19:08.730 --> 19:11.024
<i>It can be compared...</i>

19:11.942 --> 19:15.195
<i>to the best cheeses in the world.</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:18.824
And using a traditional ingredient

19:18.907 --> 19:23.120
<i>is a solid base</i>
<i>from which we can build on.</i>

19:25.330 --> 19:29.585
<i>That is why there is stuffed pasta</i>
<i>on my menu.</i>

19:29.668 --> 19:33.672
<i>It's stuffed with cheese</i>
<i>from the high part of Soča Valley.</i>

19:37.426 --> 19:41.680
<i>Even though</i>
<i>we're creating something new...</i>

19:43.682 --> 19:48.228
<i>Hiša Franko has an important role</i>

19:48.312 --> 19:51.815
<i>in keeping this tradition alive.</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:33.941
<i>Everything changed</i>

20:34.024 --> 20:39.404
<i>when Valter's father decided to retire...</i>

20:40.447 --> 20:45.160
and leave Hiša Franko to Valter.

20:48.330 --> 20:54.044
<i>Valter could not run</i>
<i>the restaurant on his own.</i>

20:57.673 --> 21:01.301
At the time,
she had a job offer in Brussels,

21:01.385 --> 21:05.430
<i>and we expected that she would take it.</i>

21:07.975 --> 21:11.812
<i>Having to make a decision</i>

21:11.895 --> 21:15.023
<i>that will hurt your family</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:20.696
<i>is one of the hardest things you can do.</i>

21:24.366 --> 21:26.201
<i>I had to decide.</i>

21:31.498 --> 21:35.919
<i>I stayed because of Valter</i>
<i>and our relationship.</i>

21:37.879 --> 21:40.924
<i>My father started panicking.</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:45.053
<i>"What will become of you?</i>

21:45.137 --> 21:47.180
<i>Are you planning</i>
<i>on working in a restaurant?"</i>

21:48.098 --> 21:50.142
<i>Then he stopped speaking to me.</i>

21:55.522 --> 22:01.028
<i>That silence was extremely painful.</i>

22:12.789 --> 22:16.209
Well, this is the right temperature.
We should measure it now.

22:18.003 --> 22:20.047
210°C, yes.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.718
The rice is all lively.
Can you see?

22:26.678 --> 22:32.309
<i>When I opened the kitchen doors,</i>

22:32.392 --> 22:37.856
<i>I didn't want to walk through them</i>

22:37.939 --> 22:40.484
<i>and change my life.</i>

22:42.611 --> 22:44.863
It would have been natural
for Valter to be the chef.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.656
<i>He grew up in the restaurant.</i>

22:47.574 --> 22:50.786
<i>But since Valter</i>
<i>was already a sommelier...</i>

22:54.122 --> 22:57.709
it had to be me.

22:59.795 --> 23:05.509
<i>The first years were extremely difficult.</i>

23:06.176 --> 23:10.430
<i>I knew how to make pasta at home,</i>

23:10.514 --> 23:15.393
<i>but that didn't mean I knew how to cook.</i>

23:17.354 --> 23:23.318
<i>I had so many questions,</i>
<i>and I had to deal with them every day.</i>

23:24.152 --> 23:26.780
<i>Why doesn't my bread rise?</i>

23:26.863 --> 23:29.407
<i>Why are my ravioli opening?</i>

23:29.491 --> 23:31.451
<i>Why is the meat dry?</i>

23:32.744 --> 23:35.622
<i>If you go to culinary school,</i>

23:35.705 --> 23:37.958
<i>takes care of all these things</i>
<i>during school.</i>

23:41.002 --> 23:46.758
I've always been a disciplined person
who needs to have everything organized.

23:46.842 --> 23:50.887
All of a sudden,
I found myself in an abyss of ignorance.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.786
And during that time,
both my children were born.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.413
First Svit...

24:17.330 --> 24:20.542
<i>and then 16 months later, Eva Klara.</i>

24:29.593 --> 24:36.516
<i>We lost most</i>
<i>of Hiša Franko's regular guests.</i>

24:39.603 --> 24:43.523
<i>We were struggling to survive financially.</i>

24:46.568 --> 24:50.947
<i>It wasn't easy, the life of a chef.</i>

24:56.036 --> 24:59.289
<i>It was a story about survival.</i>

25:12.761 --> 25:15.639
<i>Ana wanted to make</i>
<i>something great of her life.</i>

25:15.722 --> 25:17.515
<i>Since she hadn't done</i>
<i>anything in diplomacy,</i>

25:17.599 --> 25:20.227
<i>she wanted to achieve something</i>
<i>in gastronomy.</i>

25:20.310 --> 25:24.064
She had to prove to her parents

25:24.147 --> 25:27.317
and fight to show them
she had taken the right path.

25:29.527 --> 25:32.280
<i>She knew some traditional dishes,</i>

25:32.822 --> 25:35.242
<i>but she didn't know high gastronomy.</i>

25:35.325 --> 25:37.953
<i>So we went to the best restaurants around.</i>

25:39.621 --> 25:44.834
<i>I wanted to inspire her,</i>
<i>so we could develop the restaurant</i>

25:44.918 --> 25:48.505
and make something beautiful out of it.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.054
<i>Valter took me</i>
<i>to a great Italian restaurant.</i>

25:57.305 --> 26:02.727
<i>I remember a dish</i>
<i>with polenta, rhubarb and liver.</i>

26:02.811 --> 26:05.188
<i>It was so new to me, so different.</i>

26:07.107 --> 26:10.485
<i>I felt like we were</i>
<i>going to a dream world,</i>

26:10.568 --> 26:12.320
<i>like</i> Alice in Wonderland.

26:16.199 --> 26:21.246
What followed was a long,
five-year period of learning.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.001
<i>I spent a lot of time experimenting</i>

26:26.084 --> 26:28.670
<i>because I was convinced</i>
<i>I had to learn everything.</i>

26:28.753 --> 26:31.506
<i>I was testing my new dishes on the guests.</i>

26:32.716 --> 26:37.554
<i>Unfortunately for them,</i>
<i>I made many mistakes.</i>

26:44.769 --> 26:50.108
<i>That was when</i>
<i>the disciplined part of me came out.</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:56.114
<i>I went to the library</i>
<i>looking for information</i>

26:56.197 --> 26:59.326
<i>and read through</i>
<i>the few cookbooks that they had.</i>

27:02.871 --> 27:05.290
<i>I was constantly questioning.</i>

27:06.750 --> 27:10.545
<i>"Why? How?</i>
<i>Why does this reaction happen?"</i>

27:17.344 --> 27:24.309
<i>Valter's chef friends helped</i>
<i>me learn cooking techniques.</i>

27:26.353 --> 27:30.440
<i>I realized that there has to be</i>
<i>a contrast of textures,</i>

27:30.523 --> 27:32.233
<i>a contrast of temperatures.</i>

27:37.030 --> 27:43.703
<i>And then, in this trance,</i>
<i>my brain started looking for combinations.</i>

27:44.829 --> 27:49.042
<i>That was a key moment.</i>

27:57.384 --> 27:59.928
<i>I started believing in myself.</i>

28:00.845 --> 28:04.307
<i>And I knew I was on my way.</i>

28:22.409 --> 28:28.623
<i>Until independence,</i>
<i>we were a socialist/communist country.</i>

28:29.165 --> 28:32.710
Everything was the same.

28:32.794 --> 28:39.092
There was no excess,
novelty, or expression.

28:39.175 --> 28:42.595
<i>And not only in art,</i>
<i>but also in gastronomy.</i>

28:44.597 --> 28:47.058
<i>One evening, a friend of ours</i>
<i>came to dinner.</i>

28:47.142 --> 28:50.729
<i>He was a food critic.</i>

28:50.812 --> 28:53.064
<i>And after dinner he said,</i>

28:53.148 --> 28:55.358
"Ana, I ate very well.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.318
You are progressing and growing."

28:57.402 --> 28:58.862
<i>But he also said,</i>

28:58.945 --> 29:02.073
<i>"I think that you will</i>
<i>create something big</i>

29:02.157 --> 29:04.951
when you start looking around
at your own environment.

29:05.034 --> 29:08.705
<i>Why don't you try to create something</i>

29:08.788 --> 29:12.083
<i>with trout, cheese,</i>
<i>or other local ingredients?"</i>

29:13.668 --> 29:15.754
<i>When I heard that...</i>

29:15.837 --> 29:19.883
<i>something inside me changed.</i>

29:20.592 --> 29:23.011
I started thinking.

29:29.934 --> 29:35.648
<i>There is an indigenous fish</i>
<i>that lives in the Soča River.</i>

29:35.732 --> 29:37.942
<i>It's the marble trout.</i>

29:40.612 --> 29:44.908
<i>In the first part of the 20th century,</i>

29:44.991 --> 29:49.078
<i>due to pollution in the river</i>

29:49.162 --> 29:51.331
<i>the fish almost became extinct.</i>

29:52.999 --> 29:56.628
<i>But some very dedicated people...</i>

29:58.505 --> 30:04.469
<i>found a healthy family of marble trout.</i>

30:06.429 --> 30:09.724
<i>And with these trout...</i>

30:11.351 --> 30:17.690
<i>they were able to save the species.</i>

30:22.111 --> 30:26.574
<i>For this remote place where we live,</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:30.370
<i>it's a beautiful story.</i>

30:32.831 --> 30:39.295
Marble trout need cold, clean water
with a lot of oxygen.

30:40.630 --> 30:47.595
Like the people of the Soča Valley,
the trout have to fight to survive.

30:50.348 --> 30:53.142
<i>That was my story as well.</i>

30:56.938 --> 30:59.899
The dish that I created with it

30:59.983 --> 31:03.570
<i>is dedicated to that fish.</i>

31:10.410 --> 31:14.998
After that, I decided that,
with every plate I create...

31:16.749 --> 31:19.168
<i>I want my main ingredient to be one</i>

31:19.252 --> 31:21.880
<i>that comes from this environment.</i>

31:24.340 --> 31:27.594
<i>It began a new chapter for us.</i>

31:33.975 --> 31:37.645
<i>I realized when I express the territory,</i>

31:37.729 --> 31:40.481
<i>that my thoughts...</i>

31:41.608 --> 31:43.192
<i>they can travel.</i>

32:18.436 --> 32:24.817
<i>I was creating a philosophy</i>
<i>and starting a new Slovenian story.</i>

34:09.005 --> 34:12.508
<i>The article changed things.</i>
<i>It put us on the world map.</i>

34:12.592 --> 34:19.432
<i>All these little things,</i>
<i>which really aren't so little...</i>

34:20.975 --> 34:26.439
<i>help the gastronomies of small countries</i>
<i>like Slovenia</i>

34:26.522 --> 34:32.236
slowly position themselves
on the international stage.

34:37.784 --> 34:40.912
<i>At the time,</i>

34:40.995 --> 34:43.915
<i>it was a very important story</i>
<i>for Slovenian gastronomy,</i>

34:43.998 --> 34:47.376
<i>since it was still developing.</i>

34:49.003 --> 34:55.927
<i>So every step was a big step</i>
<i>for Slovenia.</i>

34:59.597 --> 35:06.145
Opening the doors for the whole nation
or for a group of chefs

35:06.229 --> 35:08.231
is very difficult.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.861
<i>But this is what defines a big chef.</i>

37:56.732 --> 38:02.488
I've chosen the Blažič cuvée
to go with your duck.

38:02.571 --> 38:05.700
A mix of merlot and sauvignon.

38:38.566 --> 38:41.819
<i>How can I say this</i>
<i>so you can understand me correctly?</i>

38:43.696 --> 38:46.699
I never meant to hurt my parents...

38:50.244 --> 38:55.750
<i>but my need to be true to myself</i>
<i>and my sense of duty to my parents</i>

38:55.833 --> 38:58.419
were fighting a battle.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.004
And I chose to follow my heart.

39:05.843 --> 39:07.178
<i>Perseverance.</i>

39:07.261 --> 39:10.431
Perseverance.
You have to be persistent at what you do.

39:10.514 --> 39:13.100
Because it's hard to believe
what you've been through.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.562
And then deciding to drop out...

39:18.814 --> 39:21.942
<i>Finally getting that affirmation</i>
<i>and being told "well done"</i>

39:22.026 --> 39:24.820
meant the world to me.

39:28.699 --> 39:33.371
<i>Ana showed all of us</i>
<i>that this valley is too small for her.</i>

39:34.455 --> 39:36.832
She had to spread her wings,

39:36.916 --> 39:39.877
and she did it in a very unusual way.

39:44.298 --> 39:50.262
Now, we have our grandchildren close by,

39:50.346 --> 39:53.432
and her success as a chef.

39:53.516 --> 39:56.310
Which is an amazing, beautiful surprise.

40:00.481 --> 40:03.109
<i>We are very proud.</i>

40:03.192 --> 40:08.614
<i>Proud of all she has</i>
<i>accomplished not only at home...</i>

40:08.697 --> 40:12.535
but internationally, as well.

40:13.452 --> 40:18.040
Truly, with love
you can accomplish anything.
