WEBVTT

00:08.520 --> 00:10.150
I'm looking for Mr. Wallace.

00:10.370 --> 00:12.820
He's not here. You got me. Speak.

00:14.130 --> 00:15.710
You knew I was coming, didn't you?

00:15.840 --> 00:16.620
Yeah.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.930
To whine to Mr. Wallace.

00:19.940 --> 00:22.059
This week's check's
60 bucks light, man.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.200
I'm just here to get what's mine.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.309
Question... you think you're pulling

00:25.310 --> 00:26.530
your weight down there, Warner?

00:26.531 --> 00:27.640
What, did my crew say I'm not?

00:27.641 --> 00:28.770
No. I say it.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.650
I see everything you
mokes do and don't do.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.260
That's why you call
me Big Brother, right?

00:33.261 --> 00:35.650
I'm trying to put a down payment
on a ring, man. Come on.

00:35.760 --> 00:38.059
Well, I guess that means
now Connie has time

00:38.060 --> 00:39.520
to find herself a real man.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:50.960 --> 00:51.830
I thought so.

00:54.600 --> 00:57.150
***

01:21.410 --> 01:22.250
***

02:53.870 --> 02:55.780
Every man has his price,
Mr. Lightman.

02:55.781 --> 02:57.460
Oh, yeah? What's mine, then?

02:59.070 --> 02:59.880
100 grand?

03:02.880 --> 03:03.970
Why come to me?

03:05.110 --> 03:07.479
Msha's about to come
out with their report

03:07.480 --> 03:10.320
saying that they found no
evidence of miner error.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.670
That's as good as saying
that the company's to blame

03:12.671 --> 03:13.910
for the death of all those men.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.280
Sounds fair.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.990
What happened in that
mine was human error.

03:18.280 --> 03:19.110
Of course it was.

03:19.520 --> 03:20.500
Always is.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.380
Bloody humans.

03:24.350 --> 03:27.119
I came up in those mines, Mr.
Lightman.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.910
20 years breaking rocks.

03:29.280 --> 03:31.939
Now, if enough methane
gas builds up down there,

03:31.940 --> 03:34.780
one slip of the hammer
sets off a spark,

03:35.230 --> 03:37.200
no one stands a chance in hell.

03:38.170 --> 03:39.600
Now, if the company's at fault,

03:39.900 --> 03:41.380
I'd be the first one to admit it.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.360
But that is not the case here.

03:43.830 --> 03:44.680
How do you know?

03:46.320 --> 03:48.360
Because I run a safe mine.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.670
You don't know, do you?

03:50.940 --> 03:52.499
I mean, not for sure, right?

03:52.500 --> 03:54.990
But if I can prove that the
company's not at fault,

03:54.991 --> 03:56.140
you get an extra little something

03:56.141 --> 03:57.440
in your Christmas envelope,
don't you?

04:37.910 --> 04:39.100
A.S.A.C. Dillon.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.530
Dr. Foster.

04:41.110 --> 04:41.990
Nice to see you.

04:42.050 --> 04:44.100
It's your boss I'm here to see.

04:45.490 --> 04:46.920
You did get the memo?

04:47.890 --> 04:49.900
We're no longer on
retainer with the FBI.

04:51.190 --> 04:52.440
And you mean my partner.

04:53.450 --> 04:55.030
You speak to him after
you're done with me.

04:55.031 --> 04:56.910
That's how we vet
our incoming cases.

04:57.650 --> 05:00.530
Your partner got Agent
Reynolds shot and wounded.

05:01.960 --> 05:02.880
How's Ben doing?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.390
Ben is riding a desk.

05:05.570 --> 05:06.960
How do you think he's doing?

05:09.540 --> 05:10.560
What are you doing here?

05:11.410 --> 05:12.350
Quid pro quo.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.010
You speak Latin now.

05:14.870 --> 05:16.820
Heh. You want to hear
some more? Pro Bono.

05:17.230 --> 05:18.840
That's what you're
gonna charge the FBI

05:18.841 --> 05:20.290
for this case I'm bringing you.

05:20.470 --> 05:22.099
Pro Bono? I don't think so.

05:22.100 --> 05:23.520
Well, then we'll drag Lightman in

05:23.810 --> 05:25.490
to answer some very
tough questions

05:25.491 --> 05:27.700
which will make him wish
that we'd stayed friends.

05:28.300 --> 05:29.100
Ok.

05:30.470 --> 05:31.710
What's he done now?

05:32.970 --> 05:34.270
I can't wait till tomorrow.

05:34.860 --> 05:35.890
What happens tomorrow?

05:35.970 --> 05:37.610
I get better-looking every day.

05:39.520 --> 05:41.390
Now you know why they
call him Jimmy the mouth.

05:41.540 --> 05:42.620
Who's dealing?

05:44.000 --> 05:45.559
Is this still Texas hold 'em,

05:45.560 --> 05:46.840
or are we ready for
a real man's game?

05:48.860 --> 05:50.160
Had enough?

05:50.950 --> 05:52.400
Or do I need to skip to the part

05:52.401 --> 05:55.070
where he sweeps 5 large in
dirty money off the table?

05:55.170 --> 05:57.080
Which, in case you're
not hearing me clearly,

05:57.140 --> 06:00.190
I can easily turn into a
felony that won't go away.

06:04.470 --> 06:06.450
Here are those pictures you
asked for, Dr. Lightman.

06:21.230 --> 06:22.980
You don't think I
grieve for my men?

06:25.260 --> 06:27.240
We're sorry for your loss,
Mr. Wallace,

06:27.380 --> 06:30.100
but apart from the
picture of your foreman,

06:30.170 --> 06:32.580
the rest aren't miners
killed in that explosion.

06:32.900 --> 06:35.850
They're 5 random pictures that
we pulled from the Internet.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.600
Hiya.

06:45.920 --> 06:46.800
Who died?

06:46.940 --> 06:48.609
Your friend Dillon from the FBI

06:48.610 --> 06:50.000
is in the conference room

06:50.060 --> 06:52.200
with a video of you

06:52.650 --> 06:54.540
playing cards with criminals.

06:55.010 --> 06:55.850
Me?

06:56.630 --> 06:57.970
Jimmy the mouth.

06:59.190 --> 07:00.360
I'll take care of the FBI.

07:01.810 --> 07:04.740
All you do is
antagonize them, Cal.

07:04.890 --> 07:06.670
That's never gonna get
them to leave us alone.

07:06.740 --> 07:09.450
What this requires
is a woman's touch.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.690
Get lost.

07:12.700 --> 07:14.089
Torres, I need you.

07:14.090 --> 07:15.360
Jimmy the mouth made a mess.

07:15.590 --> 07:16.690
And he was just leaving.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.720
What's that all about?

07:21.270 --> 07:24.490
I was never here.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.319
Dr. Lightman's not in the office.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.170
Still out playing
cards with criminals?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.080
That doesn't mean
he is a criminal.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.740
So why don't we focus on
what you're really here for.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.530
You want to use Dr. Lightman
against the men in that game.

08:05.260 --> 08:06.130
Who's that one?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.530
Name is Brian Warner.

08:10.050 --> 08:11.130
He's a timberman.

08:11.610 --> 08:13.580
He builds supports,
and the miners, they dig.

08:14.330 --> 08:15.870
One of the best I've ever seen.

08:16.890 --> 08:17.910
00 in the morning

08:17.911 --> 08:19.000
and he's already drunk.

08:20.020 --> 08:22.790
This is Mr. Lightman from
D.C. I was telling you about.

08:23.940 --> 08:24.990
Old times.

08:25.360 --> 08:27.300
Oh, yeah? Yes,
'cause I look so young.

08:27.910 --> 08:28.800
Oh. Right.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.000
I was Big Brother's
assistant foreman.

08:31.690 --> 08:33.080
I taught him everything he knows.

08:33.770 --> 08:34.450
Big Brother?

08:35.539 --> 08:36.929
Eyes in the back of
his head, did he?

08:37.390 --> 08:39.570
Yeah. Except this time.

08:43.830 --> 08:46.100
That's Hoodak. He's an engineer.

08:46.280 --> 08:49.000
Angry sober, angry drunk.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.840
It runs in the family.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.180
He blames you for
the explosion, mate.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.880
Face of the company.
Comes with the territory.

09:09.660 --> 09:11.210
Ooh. Racism's alive and kicking

09:11.420 --> 09:12.730
in hopper's river, I see.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.240
That's Darryl.

09:17.700 --> 09:19.060
He's part of the crew, too.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.290
6 men went underground on Monday.

09:28.630 --> 09:30.370
Today we mourn their passing.

09:30.750 --> 09:36.020
First and foremost, we'd like
to mourn our foreman bill Jones.

09:38.300 --> 09:39.810
We all called him Big Brother

09:40.430 --> 09:43.200
because that's what
he was to all of us.

09:43.880 --> 09:46.460
This one's so full of it,
it's coming out of his ears.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.490
He was tough,

09:47.910 --> 09:50.340
but he always had our backs.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.810
And everyone here knows it.

09:53.060 --> 09:55.810
What do you expect with
his family here, huh?

09:56.130 --> 09:59.189
I would expect the
man eulogizing him

09:59.190 --> 10:01.850
to at least try to
hide his contempt.

10:02.350 --> 10:05.070
Let's all bow our heads
in a moment of silence.

10:49.040 --> 10:49.930
Hello.

10:51.370 --> 10:54.140
That was a very touching eulogy.

10:55.600 --> 10:56.940
I was moved.

10:57.660 --> 10:58.620
Who the hell are you?

10:58.880 --> 11:00.600
I'm sorry about your
foreman in there.

11:01.580 --> 11:02.690
You're with Wallace.

11:02.820 --> 11:04.180
Yeah, he's sorry, too.

11:04.840 --> 11:07.780
And for the other 5 men
that got killed with him.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.910
You're leaving so soon?

11:13.080 --> 11:14.470
He's only just racked them up.

11:14.630 --> 11:15.710
Nature calls.

11:15.990 --> 11:16.930
You know,

11:18.220 --> 11:21.689
I am gonna find out what
happened down that mine

11:21.690 --> 11:23.330
that makes you so ashamed.

11:24.670 --> 11:26.940
I'm kind of a pain
in the ass that way.

11:27.450 --> 11:30.020
Being a miner's not a question
of if you're gonna get hurt,

11:30.100 --> 11:31.090
just when.

11:31.470 --> 11:33.580
Really? So, how's it work, then?

11:34.280 --> 11:37.530
All right, 6 of you get
killed all together

11:37.570 --> 11:39.579
and you guys just
knock back a few pints

11:39.580 --> 11:41.240
and put it down to
accidents will happen.

11:41.241 --> 11:42.080
Is that how it goes, eh?

11:45.040 --> 11:46.900
You're not welcome in this bar.

11:47.700 --> 11:49.300
You got some nerve
coming in here, Wallace.

11:49.360 --> 11:52.630
Connie, I'm here to pay my
respects like everyone else.

11:52.740 --> 11:53.810
Connie, it's all right.

11:53.920 --> 11:56.100
My kid cousin Joey was
killed in that explosion.

11:56.270 --> 11:58.390
How do you dare tell me
it's all right, Sully?

11:59.040 --> 12:01.720
He was just a canary.
18 years old.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.580
His first week down
your damn mine.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.100
Ok, hold on, guys.

12:09.150 --> 12:10.690
We don't want any trouble,
Mr. Wallace.

12:13.140 --> 12:14.050
Where you going?!

12:15.720 --> 12:16.700
Back off!

12:16.701 --> 12:17.630
You ain't gonna use it.

12:17.880 --> 12:18.740
Try me.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.290
Try me.

12:27.470 --> 12:28.750
Who the hell are you?

12:32.170 --> 12:33.070
He's with me.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.440
Here, give me that.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.810
It's all good.
The sheriff's outside.

12:50.400 --> 12:51.590
I want everyone out,

12:52.160 --> 12:54.330
except for you four.

12:54.390 --> 12:55.120
All right?

12:57.110 --> 12:57.980
And him.

12:58.330 --> 12:59.670
The rest of you leave. All right.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.540
This is our bar,
not your mine, Wallace.

13:01.541 --> 13:03.200
Either you answer his
questions in here

13:03.201 --> 13:04.490
or the sheriff's outside.

13:05.370 --> 13:07.520
All right, well, nature calls.

13:18.970 --> 13:21.240
Did Foster tell you
to follow me here?

13:22.370 --> 13:23.820
No, that was all my idea.

13:24.540 --> 13:26.420
You think what you did out
there is clever, do you?

13:26.700 --> 13:28.819
You mean as opposed to
what you were about to do

13:28.820 --> 13:29.760
with that bottle?

13:38.510 --> 13:39.550
Back up, cobra.

13:40.530 --> 13:41.470
Right.

13:41.990 --> 13:42.940
Sorry.

13:44.660 --> 13:46.490
4 miners were all
on the same crew.

13:47.950 --> 13:48.900
How do you know that?

13:50.710 --> 13:51.790
They've probably known each other

13:51.791 --> 13:52.880
since they were kids.

13:54.370 --> 13:56.510
And now they count on each other

13:56.960 --> 13:58.200
for their lives every day.

13:59.460 --> 14:03.260
So John, Paul, George,
and Ringo have a secret.

14:04.350 --> 14:05.740
We identify their weakest link.

14:08.910 --> 14:10.620
What would I do
without you, Loker?

14:11.750 --> 14:14.269
Meet Joseph Hench,
also known as Bruzzy

14:14.270 --> 14:16.260
by his foot soldiers
back in Boston.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.870
Nice eyes for a guy with henchmen.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.650
He ordered the gangland shootings

14:20.940 --> 14:23.080
of 7 rivals and a federal judge.

14:23.170 --> 14:24.080
Allegedly.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.749
All the same, he's on
your most-wanted list.

14:26.750 --> 14:27.780
He's at the top of the list.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.710
Um, bring up the poker game.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.700
That's him.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.150
What if Lightman can't help?

14:40.210 --> 14:42.249
The arrest of every
person at this poker game

14:42.250 --> 14:43.420
is the next step.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.160
By the next step,
you mean Lightman?

14:46.210 --> 14:48.230
I'm not letting you near Lightman,
so forget that.

15:02.890 --> 15:05.480
Let me guess. Love song?

15:07.720 --> 15:08.600
Oi, Paul.

15:09.060 --> 15:11.380
Over here. Yeah, you.
Over here, man.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.710
Name's Brian, not Paul.

15:18.090 --> 15:19.630
Oh, really? Really.

15:20.080 --> 15:21.640
You guys don't
belong in here, man.

15:21.641 --> 15:23.790
You belong behind bars for what
happened down that mine, mate.

15:28.610 --> 15:29.570
Is she single?

15:31.250 --> 15:33.100
Oh, I'm sorry. You and her, eh?

15:33.930 --> 15:34.830
Say no more.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.750
Don't take plastic.
And it's peanuts or nothing.

15:38.460 --> 15:39.610
All right.

15:41.230 --> 15:43.250
You two make a handsome couple.

15:46.850 --> 15:48.150
Does he always drink like this

15:48.151 --> 15:49.250
or is just since the accident?

15:51.220 --> 15:53.910
What did he tell you about
what happened down that mine?

15:56.790 --> 15:57.710
Oh, that much.

15:58.840 --> 15:59.890
That was a bit careless, Brian.

16:01.290 --> 16:02.490
Make that your last one, Brian.

16:02.560 --> 16:04.460
I didn't tell anybody anything.

16:04.760 --> 16:05.930
Anything about what, babe?

16:06.930 --> 16:10.990
About who killed your kid
cousin and his mates.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.230
I don't know what
you're talking about.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.560
About how big brother
had it coming.

16:18.030 --> 16:20.290
He's trying to mess
with your head, sweetie.

16:20.600 --> 16:21.890
You take it from me, mate,

16:21.891 --> 16:23.820
you've already told me
much more than you realize.

16:23.880 --> 16:25.350
You should back up out of my face

16:25.351 --> 16:26.850
before you get really hurt.

16:26.851 --> 16:27.980
***

16:28.090 --> 16:29.160
Oh, yeah? Yeah.

16:29.670 --> 16:30.740
We ok here?

16:31.190 --> 16:31.980
Oh, yeah.

16:32.090 --> 16:33.710
He's about to throw up, though.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.610
And it's not the drink,
it's the nerves.

16:38.820 --> 16:39.520
All right.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.540
I think I'll take them
peanuts now, darling.

16:52.590 --> 16:53.990
So, how long you guys
known each other?

16:54.290 --> 16:55.260
Long enough.

16:57.440 --> 16:58.780
First question's free.

16:58.980 --> 17:00.320
Next one costs you.

17:02.790 --> 17:05.290
You two idiots start a
shift in less than an hour.

17:05.420 --> 17:06.410
Take a hike.

17:10.050 --> 17:10.800
Go.

17:16.770 --> 17:18.910
What do you got in your pocket,
huh? A gun?

17:19.030 --> 17:20.089
Don't push it, son.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.180
For your own good.

17:27.950 --> 17:29.030
That's not a gun, is it?

17:34.290 --> 17:35.490
A little advice, son?

17:36.980 --> 17:39.280
Go home, before you get hurt.

17:42.280 --> 17:45.090
I told the FBI Agent, uh, Dillon,

17:46.530 --> 17:48.500
no one knows each other
outside of card game.

17:48.930 --> 17:51.550
No one digs nose into
each other's business.

17:51.800 --> 17:53.470
High stakes poker.

17:54.180 --> 17:55.230
That's it.

17:55.730 --> 17:57.580
Everyone has a good time.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.590
Are those hair plugs?

18:00.950 --> 18:03.860
Are those, uh, fake breasts?

18:06.130 --> 18:07.840
Well, he's deflecting
about the doll hair.

18:08.190 --> 18:10.000
But everything else
he's saying is true.

18:11.970 --> 18:14.190
You didn't just stumble
into the poker game one day.

18:14.320 --> 18:15.300
You were invited.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.400
By whom?

18:20.180 --> 18:21.080
This is him.

18:23.580 --> 18:24.970
The guy who invited me.

18:27.910 --> 18:28.900
What about this guy?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.350
Who's he?

18:30.980 --> 18:32.340
Ahh. Jimmy the mouth.

18:33.690 --> 18:35.350
Funny, funny guy. Ha ha ha ha!

18:37.340 --> 18:38.960
So if everybody is invited,

18:39.380 --> 18:40.410
who invited him?

18:42.180 --> 18:43.330
Wheels.

18:45.300 --> 18:47.340
His name is wheels.

18:52.270 --> 18:53.540
How you doing,
Connie? Are you all right?

18:55.920 --> 18:56.760
Yeah?

18:58.490 --> 18:59.540
Nor is Brian.

19:01.280 --> 19:05.000
The secret of how those men died

19:05.490 --> 19:06.740
is killing him.

19:09.150 --> 19:12.840
And the others,
they can smell his fear.

19:16.520 --> 19:17.360
Souvenir?

19:22.020 --> 19:22.830
Where you going?

19:23.260 --> 19:24.830
Where do you think I'm going?
I'm going to work.

19:46.300 --> 19:47.880
Got a new canary for you.

19:55.550 --> 19:56.900
Tweet.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.890
Where's your engineer, then?

20:06.260 --> 20:07.010
Hoodak?

20:07.800 --> 20:08.800
He saw a rabbit.

20:09.820 --> 20:12.060
Let me guess...
Bunnies bring bad luck, right?

20:12.380 --> 20:14.670
Who knows? Point is,
we cut him a break.

20:19.050 --> 20:20.380
Last thing you want down here

20:20.381 --> 20:21.950
is someone's who's had
too much to drink, right?

20:22.140 --> 20:23.060
You got that right.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.230
But you let him down here.

20:26.010 --> 20:27.400
And he's had a skinful.

20:27.940 --> 20:29.720
Can't do squat without
your timberman.

20:35.030 --> 20:36.120
You cold, Brian?

20:38.650 --> 20:41.210
No, it's the draft from
the methane extractor fan.

20:42.040 --> 20:43.040
Don't worry, I'll live.

20:45.570 --> 20:46.320
Oh, yeah?

20:58.670 --> 20:59.410
Right.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.290
The engineer stayed
up top for a reason.

21:02.780 --> 21:05.500
Connie. She's knows this crew's
involved in the explosion.

21:05.820 --> 21:06.870
Brian told her.

21:08.850 --> 21:10.720
So Hoodak's up there
to silence Connie?

21:14.620 --> 21:15.740
You still here, college boy?

21:18.010 --> 21:19.880
Aw, maybe he saw an
itty bitty bunny, too.

21:20.140 --> 21:22.180
Just pour and shut up, Connie.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.880
I want you turn the
fans off in this shaft.

21:35.050 --> 21:36.300
I want a methane buildup.

21:36.795 --> 21:39.216
Do you have any idea how
dangerous it is down here?

21:39.217 --> 21:40.217
While you're at it,

21:40.218 --> 21:43.091
stand the sheriffs and the
emergency services by.

21:46.990 --> 21:48.072
And trust me.

21:48.994 --> 21:51.356
All right, but save yourself the
respirator till the last moment.

21:51.357 --> 21:53.341
It'll give you about one hour
before you have to get out.

21:53.780 --> 21:55.073
That's all the air you'll have.

21:55.596 --> 21:56.245
All right.

21:57.725 --> 22:00.609
But you're gonna turn the fans
on again in an hour, right?

22:01.251 --> 22:02.047
Yeah.

22:03.299 --> 22:04.203
All right.

22:10.010 --> 22:11.306
This is your last, Hoodak.

22:11.307 --> 22:13.471
Drink up, go home, sleep it off.

22:26.247 --> 22:27.162
Hey.

22:27.954 --> 22:29.688
Why'd your boss go down that mine?

22:30.141 --> 22:33.196
Well, he operates on the premise

22:33.197 --> 22:35.248
that a predator has most success

22:35.249 --> 22:37.671
striking where its prey
feels most at home.

22:42.576 --> 22:44.628
Hey.

22:46.087 --> 22:49.041
So, is that safe down here?

22:49.374 --> 22:51.398
No, it's not.
Nothing's safe down here.

22:52.083 --> 22:56.198
So one spark, all right,
and good night, nurse?

22:57.388 --> 22:58.508
Perfect crime, right?

23:00.020 --> 23:01.654
If there was a methane buildup,

23:01.655 --> 23:03.919
you should probably ask the
people that run this place

23:03.920 --> 23:06.284
why they keep
shutting the fans off.

23:07.304 --> 23:11.047
So Big Brother was the
face of everything

23:11.048 --> 23:13.069
you resent about
management, right?

23:13.625 --> 23:15.204
I didn't kill him.

23:18.306 --> 23:19.766
The company did.

23:21.777 --> 23:22.981
Yeah.

23:24.281 --> 23:25.598
The company did.

23:27.738 --> 23:31.297
Yo, Bri, we need those timbers
down the shaft yesterday, bro.

23:31.298 --> 23:33.182
Yeah, I'm sorry. Come on.

23:34.058 --> 23:38.073
So, did you resent Big Brother

23:38.074 --> 23:39.646
as much as he did?

23:43.785 --> 23:45.550
Oh. Worse.

23:46.401 --> 23:48.513
Oh, strong, silent type.
I can work with that.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.218
The more we talk,

23:49.219 --> 23:52.071
the colder America gets,
yellow bird.

23:57.645 --> 23:58.880
Thanks.

24:03.086 --> 24:04.140
What's this?

24:04.141 --> 24:05.797
Pickpocket son of a bitch.

24:05.798 --> 24:07.561
It's part of a door handle.

24:08.078 --> 24:10.473
What is this, blast damage?

24:10.952 --> 24:12.119
It's coal dust in the grooves,

24:12.120 --> 24:13.919
looks like it's been
sawed off or something.

24:13.920 --> 24:16.632
I'm thinking sometime
before the explosion.

24:16.633 --> 24:17.909
Where's Hoodak?

24:18.593 --> 24:20.328
He must have went home already.

24:20.329 --> 24:21.699
Want to check on that?

24:24.177 --> 24:25.244
What's this?

24:31.560 --> 24:33.836
Maybe we'll find one of your
foreman's teeth in here.

24:33.928 --> 24:35.740
Mining's dangerous work.

24:35.784 --> 24:37.469
Big Brother knew the risk.

24:38.236 --> 24:39.927
Him and, what, 5 others?

24:39.928 --> 24:41.956
You should know the risks, too.

24:43.832 --> 24:44.999
That's why you all got to

24:45.000 --> 24:46.803
trust each other down
here completely, right?

24:49.568 --> 24:51.259
'Cause your lives depend on it.

24:51.312 --> 24:52.533
No matter what.

24:55.433 --> 24:58.515
Even though you know what
they really think about you.

24:58.560 --> 25:00.741
Down here we all the same color.

25:01.632 --> 25:02.996
Oh, nice try.

25:04.104 --> 25:05.183
Our brotherhood's stronger

25:05.184 --> 25:07.620
than whatever b.S.
You're trying to spin.

25:08.272 --> 25:10.964
What, the same brotherhood
that got 6 men killed?

25:14.888 --> 25:18.157
You're not leaving here until
you tell me how you got this.

25:20.272 --> 25:22.444
It's the handle
from the tool room.

25:22.969 --> 25:24.622
When the feds from mine safety

25:24.623 --> 25:26.807
were sifting through
the rubble, I saw it.

25:26.808 --> 25:28.550
You stole evidence?

25:28.978 --> 25:30.134
You don't know nothing, kid,

25:30.135 --> 25:31.799
so just keep it in your pants.

25:31.800 --> 25:33.759
So your men just locked
Big Brother in there

25:33.760 --> 25:35.315
and left him to die.

25:36.392 --> 25:39.079
It was a prank, a stupid prank.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.245
Nobody was meant to get killed.

25:40.246 --> 25:43.596
They just wanted to teach that
bullheaded bastard a lesson.

25:43.597 --> 25:45.786
A lesson? How do you know that?

25:46.486 --> 25:48.917
You want to kill
somebody in a mine,

25:48.918 --> 25:50.828
you take a hammer to them

25:50.829 --> 25:52.786
and you bury them in a wall.

25:54.134 --> 25:56.044
They locked him in the tool room.

25:56.045 --> 25:57.409
He panicked.

25:57.494 --> 25:58.677
Because of the methane buildup.

25:58.678 --> 26:00.018
Because he wasn't
running the fans.

26:00.902 --> 26:03.826
Saving the company money
is what got him killed.

26:05.382 --> 26:07.593
Well, him and those other five.

26:11.508 --> 26:13.490
You and I need to
talk to the sheriff.

26:14.429 --> 26:15.657
Let's go.

26:27.013 --> 26:30.196
I used to think you lot
were a really tight crew.

26:30.197 --> 26:31.378
You know?

26:31.749 --> 26:33.602
Till about a minute ago.

26:39.109 --> 26:43.860
What's worse when operating
machinery down a mine...

26:43.861 --> 26:45.650
Too much alcohol

26:45.718 --> 26:47.273
or living a lie?!

26:52.341 --> 26:53.937
'Cause it is hard,

26:54.078 --> 26:56.652
if not impossible,
to work like that

26:56.653 --> 26:58.370
and lie at the same time.

26:59.214 --> 27:02.034
Well, that's real interesting.

27:03.006 --> 27:04.210
Just saying.

27:10.782 --> 27:13.290
You didn't mean to kill
all 6 men, did you?

27:17.126 --> 27:18.322
Eh?

27:19.733 --> 27:21.265
Just the foreman.

27:23.542 --> 27:24.162
You told him.

27:24.163 --> 27:25.941
No, no. I told you to stop.

27:25.942 --> 27:27.778
Digging ain't your game.

27:28.390 --> 27:31.425
Look, he didn't tell me a thing.

27:33.798 --> 27:35.444
If he'd have blabbed to me up top,

27:35.445 --> 27:38.050
you think I'd be down here playing
city buggers with you two?

27:40.766 --> 27:42.625
Damn methane meter's in the red.

27:44.734 --> 27:46.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
What are you doing?

27:46.545 --> 27:48.159
You're gonna get us all killed.

27:48.160 --> 27:49.868
All right, well, look at them.

27:49.888 --> 27:50.989
Look at them.

27:53.241 --> 27:55.316
You think they're gonna let
us out of here alive now?

27:55.777 --> 27:56.964
You wouldn't do that.

27:58.856 --> 28:00.051
Try me.

28:08.770 --> 28:10.888
You really want to take
that chance, do you?

28:13.195 --> 28:14.651
What the hell are you doing?

28:14.652 --> 28:16.874
This gas is nasty, mate.

28:16.875 --> 28:18.904
Wouldn't want to make a spark,
now, do I?

28:19.139 --> 28:21.159
Would you give me that,
you psycho.

28:21.612 --> 28:23.642
Something like this happened
with Big Brother, did it?

28:23.643 --> 28:25.799
Just put the shovel down.
We'll talk.

28:26.147 --> 28:28.840
You didn't turn off
those fans that morning.

28:29.883 --> 28:31.870
Only management can do that.

28:32.739 --> 28:35.426
The methane buildup was
an accident, all right?

28:35.427 --> 28:37.187
They just meant to
put the fear of God

28:37.188 --> 28:38.691
into Big Brother a little bit.

28:38.692 --> 28:40.887
All right? Just scare him,
that's all.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.495
Wait, wait!

28:46.872 --> 28:47.665
Well, go on, then.

28:47.666 --> 28:49.168
Run after them.

28:49.323 --> 28:51.480
See if they'll let you
out of here alive now.

29:01.707 --> 29:02.619
Look,

29:02.620 --> 29:05.475
they came into the mine
before the dawn shift.

29:05.476 --> 29:07.677
But all they wanted to do was mess
with the tool room door handle

29:07.678 --> 29:09.981
before Big Brother came
down to do his check.

29:09.982 --> 29:11.361
That's all.

29:11.798 --> 29:12.845
Where were you?

29:12.846 --> 29:14.420
I was with Connie.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.084
Big Brother just
docked some of my pay.

29:16.085 --> 29:18.132
I figured, what the hell,
screw him.

29:18.929 --> 29:21.238
Look, when I heard
the mine blew, I...

29:21.506 --> 29:23.478
I didn't know what to think.

29:24.433 --> 29:26.333
Oh, you knew, all right.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.511
You just didn't want
to believe your crew

29:28.512 --> 29:30.485
could do something
like that, did you?

29:32.531 --> 29:33.927
Did you tell Connie?

29:34.819 --> 29:36.343
You put her in danger.

29:37.818 --> 29:39.966
You want to do something
about that, do you?

29:46.308 --> 29:47.634
What did you do to this guy?

29:47.635 --> 29:50.470
It wasn't us. It was his bookie.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.927
Mr. wheels here is a
degenerate gambler.

29:54.251 --> 29:55.586
Your name wheels?

29:55.587 --> 29:57.030
Your name legs?

29:58.529 --> 30:00.205
Gillian Foster.

30:00.256 --> 30:01.803
Johnny Carl.

30:03.440 --> 30:06.901
And there I was, thinking I could
feel nothing below the waist.

30:08.448 --> 30:09.700
Thank you.

30:14.175 --> 30:15.851
How'd you end up in the chair?

30:16.184 --> 30:18.036
I got bit by a shark.

30:18.161 --> 30:20.165
The kind that makes bad loans.

30:23.184 --> 30:24.476
Two in the spine.

30:25.329 --> 30:26.972
They don't kill guys like me.

30:27.336 --> 30:29.700
A dead man can't pay his debts.

30:31.201 --> 30:32.780
You know a friend of mine.

30:32.936 --> 30:34.332
Jimmy the mouth.

30:35.536 --> 30:37.227
Jimmy's a friend of yours?

30:37.601 --> 30:39.471
I always knew he was a classy guy.

30:39.472 --> 30:40.616
I wouldn't go that far.

30:40.617 --> 30:43.615
Hey. That's a friend of
mine you're talking about.

30:43.616 --> 30:45.510
Fascinating.
You're defending his honor.

30:45.511 --> 30:46.839
Jimmy the mouth.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.605
He really a friend of yours?

30:53.095 --> 30:54.167
So what do you owe him?

30:54.168 --> 30:55.199
None of your business.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.607
That personal?

30:56.608 --> 30:58.352
We worked those card games,
him and me.

30:58.353 --> 30:59.638
Him and me, like you're brothers.

30:59.639 --> 31:00.707
Mm...

31:11.834 --> 31:13.262
He looks different here.

31:13.370 --> 31:14.918
Help me help him, Johnny.

31:25.993 --> 31:27.689
Jimmy bummed a smoke off of me

31:27.690 --> 31:30.439
on a subway platform last year.

31:30.786 --> 31:32.454
He doesn't smoke.

31:35.002 --> 31:36.841
Let's just say I was
waiting for the train

31:36.842 --> 31:38.373
but I wasn't going to get on it.

31:39.153 --> 31:41.054
You were going to kill yourself.

31:42.258 --> 31:43.792
Thank you, Agent Dillon.

31:43.793 --> 31:45.103
I've got this.

31:48.738 --> 31:50.029
Jimmy saw it.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.653
I don't know how.
The guy's a magician.

31:53.394 --> 31:55.185
He turns red to black,
got me out of debt

31:55.186 --> 31:56.662
right at that card table.

31:56.938 --> 31:58.909
Where's the next
card game gonna be?

32:02.099 --> 32:03.393
It's a floating game.

32:03.394 --> 32:04.797
But I didn't say that.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.398
You didn't have to.

32:23.460 --> 32:24.976
Put the gun down, Hoodak.

32:25.963 --> 32:27.825
How long we known each other?

32:27.828 --> 32:29.360
Since we were kids, right?

32:29.361 --> 32:30.687
You don't want to kill me.

32:30.688 --> 32:32.141
Shut up, Connie!

32:32.993 --> 32:34.422
Who put you up to this?

32:34.609 --> 32:35.568
Sully?

32:35.569 --> 32:37.503
I know that Brian told you.

32:37.504 --> 32:39.893
I swear, he didn't
tell me anything.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.453
That explosion...

32:42.489 --> 32:43.552
Was an accident.

32:43.553 --> 32:45.761
I believe you, ok? Just...

32:45.762 --> 32:48.485
Just... just put down the gun. Ok?

32:49.354 --> 32:51.070
I wish I could, Connie.

32:56.315 --> 32:57.670
Stay down.

33:02.547 --> 33:03.863
Hey, where you going?

33:03.912 --> 33:05.413
Where you going?

33:32.073 --> 33:35.182
I give you this and we're even.

33:37.369 --> 33:39.357
If Hench is there
we'll take him down.

33:40.818 --> 33:42.657
Then Lightman gets off the hook.

33:42.658 --> 33:45.750
If Hench is there,
you lose our number,

33:46.481 --> 33:47.758
for good.

33:52.386 --> 33:53.572
Your word.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.845
Ok.

34:09.826 --> 34:11.670
Somebody turned the fans back on.

34:16.803 --> 34:17.896
I knew it.

34:18.766 --> 34:20.321
You want to talk some more.

34:32.292 --> 34:34.056
That hammer's what,

34:34.295 --> 34:36.646
800 pounds of force, right?

34:36.649 --> 34:37.541
Shut up.

34:37.542 --> 34:39.942
No, so, if it's a chest shot,

34:39.943 --> 34:41.766
that's automatic cracked ribs

34:41.766 --> 34:43.524
and, you know, punctured lung,

34:43.525 --> 34:45.174
drowning in your own
blood type of thing.

34:45.175 --> 34:48.203
But if it's a head shot,
much cleaner.

34:48.855 --> 34:50.897
I mean, what's a
bit of brain matter

34:50.900 --> 34:52.239
between men?

34:53.139 --> 34:54.400
You done?

34:55.987 --> 34:57.872
You don't want to do this, do you?

34:58.108 --> 35:00.034
But if you do do it, all right,

35:00.035 --> 35:02.751
you should at least know what
it is you're about to do.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.504
6 men dead already.

35:08.012 --> 35:09.848
How many more can you live with?

35:14.845 --> 35:15.928
Now...

35:19.972 --> 35:21.353
Now give me that.

35:25.044 --> 35:26.361
Shift's over.

35:34.915 --> 35:36.969
What the hell is going on here?

35:38.427 --> 35:40.224
This ain't who we are, bro.

35:41.459 --> 35:43.536
That's exactly who he is.

35:43.567 --> 35:45.861
***

35:47.011 --> 35:48.705
And you know it.

35:50.654 --> 35:53.146
See, this is what happens, Sully,

35:53.567 --> 35:55.635
when you send a boy
to do a man's job.

35:56.766 --> 35:58.459
Ain't that the truth.

36:02.734 --> 36:03.699
All right.

36:03.864 --> 36:05.964
He brought a knife to a fistfight.

36:06.695 --> 36:07.867
Out, then.

36:22.508 --> 36:23.656
Oi.

36:24.843 --> 36:25.977
Where's Connie?

36:26.092 --> 36:27.872
She just ran out
of here with a gun.

36:28.244 --> 36:29.440
I called the cops.

36:30.492 --> 36:33.000
She's gone to speak
for her dead cousin.

36:44.099 --> 36:46.945
Looks like this is your canary
come home to roost, mate.

36:47.977 --> 36:49.460
Baby, what are you doing?

36:50.777 --> 36:52.492
He's the one who did this...

36:53.193 --> 36:54.452
To all of us.

36:55.090 --> 36:57.766
Men like old times,

36:57.961 --> 36:59.389
with black lung.

37:00.544 --> 37:01.888
Brian's crew,

37:01.889 --> 37:04.524
dealing with bastards like
Big Brother day in, day out.

37:04.525 --> 37:06.104
You're responsible!

37:06.140 --> 37:07.360
Darling.

37:07.484 --> 37:10.792
If you've come here
for a true confession,

37:11.052 --> 37:12.695
a gun's not the way.

37:15.052 --> 37:16.600
All right, answer her.

37:16.875 --> 37:18.856
Answer her, Wallace, anyway.

37:19.981 --> 37:21.971
As far as legal
liability is concerned...

37:21.972 --> 37:23.260
No, properly!

37:23.261 --> 37:24.537
Like a man.

37:25.069 --> 37:27.112
The truth is, we can't...

37:27.587 --> 37:30.355
Dig the stuff out of
the ground fast enough.

37:30.356 --> 37:32.440
That's not an excuse, Wallace,

37:32.460 --> 37:34.904
for the conditions we're
working. You know it.

37:35.148 --> 37:37.627
You beat the drum,
Big Brother cracked the whip.

37:37.628 --> 37:39.056
Listen to me, ok?

37:39.966 --> 37:41.288
Your cousin,

37:41.564 --> 37:42.848
all of them...

37:43.861 --> 37:45.136
I'm sorry.

37:45.524 --> 37:47.259
I am so sorry.

37:47.260 --> 37:48.620
And I promise you,

37:48.621 --> 37:51.361
I will do everything I
can to make it right.

37:52.924 --> 37:54.199
All right, well...

37:55.438 --> 37:57.383
For your information, love,

37:57.708 --> 37:59.433
he means that bit.

38:04.508 --> 38:07.016
All right, Wallace,
here's what you have to do.

38:07.340 --> 38:08.723
You let the accident report

38:08.724 --> 38:10.889
stand and the company
takes the blame...

38:11.590 --> 38:13.999
And they pay the damages in full.

38:14.524 --> 38:15.864
It's untrue.

38:16.173 --> 38:17.259
It's untrue.

38:17.260 --> 38:19.417
I should just let
her shoot you, mate.

38:19.445 --> 38:20.523
Ok, ok, ok!

38:20.524 --> 38:21.633
Ok!

38:24.140 --> 38:25.168
All right.

38:29.116 --> 38:31.273
Once they fire me, and they will,

38:32.397 --> 38:34.740
things will just go back to
the way they've always been,

38:34.741 --> 38:37.567
with a new big
brother and a new me.

38:37.572 --> 38:39.492
And that's how it'll be

38:39.493 --> 38:41.961
until all that coal is gone.

38:45.805 --> 38:48.472
And there I was thinking I
was saving the world, mate.

38:56.881 --> 38:58.198
Let me have it.

39:13.308 --> 39:14.424
Thank you.

39:14.772 --> 39:16.211
I'm not much of a whiskey drinker,

39:16.212 --> 39:17.912
but this is smooth.

39:18.755 --> 39:20.688
50-year-old malt.

39:21.338 --> 39:23.543
You steal this from
Lightman's stash?

39:27.972 --> 39:29.192
You did?

39:30.439 --> 39:32.332
Up yours.

39:35.210 --> 39:36.558
All right.

39:40.107 --> 39:41.486
You deserve it, though.

39:43.001 --> 39:44.665
You saved his ass today.

39:44.666 --> 39:46.030
It's force of habit.

39:47.433 --> 39:49.334
What makes this
time any different?

39:53.617 --> 39:55.546
Well, this time he
actually noticed.

39:55.547 --> 39:57.361
You know, when I told
him that I was gonna

39:57.362 --> 40:00.878
get rid of the FBI once and for all,
he said thank you.

40:02.289 --> 40:04.181
He actually said that?

40:05.137 --> 40:06.494
Less talk.

40:07.314 --> 40:08.566
More drink.

40:18.943 --> 40:23.036
This love of mine

40:26.800 --> 40:30.869
goes on and on

40:32.799 --> 40:37.300
though life is empty

40:39.072 --> 40:43.243
since you have gone

40:47.886 --> 40:49.217
aye, aye.

40:53.473 --> 40:56.861
Though out of sight

41:00.705 --> 41:03.724
it's lonesome till the day...

41:07.328 --> 41:08.461
You know...

41:08.904 --> 41:11.285
I never realized there
were so many stars.

41:12.257 --> 41:13.493
There aren't.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.197
That's my very expensive
scotch talking.

41:18.448 --> 41:19.592
Ohh.

41:19.593 --> 41:21.197
What's mine is mine...

41:22.697 --> 41:25.037
Render unto Caesar, you know....

41:25.545 --> 41:26.724
And all that.

41:29.449 --> 41:32.421
Loker's earned his
stripes finally.

41:36.864 --> 41:38.284
The FBI...

41:38.824 --> 41:39.988
They won't be back.

41:41.976 --> 41:44.071
That scotch was a gift

41:44.072 --> 41:46.268
from a very grateful client.

41:47.051 --> 41:49.179
Johnny wheels was a client.

41:52.151 --> 41:53.948
We have had a good day,
haven't we?

41:54.407 --> 41:56.492
And you're gonna thank me for it.

42:01.016 --> 42:02.747
You're gonna say thank you...

42:04.304 --> 42:05.723
And...

42:06.552 --> 42:10.204
I'm gonna stand here until you do.

42:28.968 --> 42:30.629
I'm waiting.

42:41.862 --> 42:45.762
Thank you for
cleaning up my mess...

42:46.535 --> 42:47.827
Gillian.

42:52.583 --> 42:56.227
I can't wait until tomorrow.

42:56.768 --> 42:58.604
Why? What's tomorrow?

43:00.808 --> 43:03.324
I get better-looking every day.
