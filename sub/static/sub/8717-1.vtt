00:10.000 --> 00:16.049
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:16.049 --> 00:19.041
I am not gonna make a fuss over it.
I promise.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:19.041 --> 00:19.152
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:19.152 --> 00:22.000
It's not that I don't appreciate you offering
to stay with me while Peter's away.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

00:22.000 --> 00:23.350
It's not that I don't appreciate you offering
to stay with me while Peter's away.

00:23.456 --> 00:24.886
You go visit your friend.

00:24.887 --> 00:27.859
After the baby comes, there
won't be much travelin'.

00:27.961 --> 00:30.259
Thank you for understanding, Mary.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.854
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,
but I do wanna visit Belinda.

00:32.966 --> 00:37.903
It takes a lot more than that
to hurt this old crone's feelings.

00:38.004 --> 00:42.134
But it would hurt my feelings if you
delivered my first grandson without me.

00:42.242 --> 00:45.734
I'll be back in plenty of time.
And I'm counting on you.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.780
Keep good thoughts. For the baby.

00:48.882 --> 00:51.112
- We'll see you in a few weeks, Mother.
- All right.

00:51.217 --> 00:55.017
Peter Watson, you drive slowly and easily...

00:55.121 --> 00:57.988
and-and avoid the ruts and the bumps.

00:58.091 --> 01:02.824
Annie and my grandson do not need
to be jostled around like a sack of potatoes.

01:02.929 --> 01:04.897
Yes, ma'am.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.224
- I got it, Freddy Joe.
- Yes, sir!

01:09.335 --> 01:12.099
Step up!

01:18.778 --> 01:20.973
Have a good time!

01:49.642 --> 01:52.133
It just feels awful sometimes.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.213
What exactly are you feeling?

01:54.314 --> 01:57.477
I don't mean to complain, Doctor,
but I 'm just plumb wore out.

01:57.584 --> 01:59.552
Sometimes I can barely keep my head up.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.847
And when did you start feeling this way?

02:01.955 --> 02:04.719
When I had my youngest,
about five months ago.

02:08.895 --> 02:11.193
Open your mouth, please.

02:15.902 --> 02:19.360
Your gums are very pale, Mabel. You haven't
noticed when you look in the mirror?

02:19.472 --> 02:21.997
I'm not sure I know
what they're supposed to look like.

02:22.108 --> 02:25.874
Well, I think you have anemia, which means
you don't have enough iron in your body.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.424
It's common with new mothers.

02:27.425 --> 02:30.313
When the baby was inside of you,
he took most of your iron.

02:30.416 --> 02:33.317
- So it's nothing serious then?
- Oh, it's very serious.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.319
What took you so long to come to me?

02:35.421 --> 02:38.720
Well, you see,
my husband doesn't think I'm really sick.

02:38.825 --> 02:42.420
- He says I'm just lazy.
- You take care of six children and a husband.

02:42.529 --> 02:43.853
You work harder than he does.

02:43.854 --> 02:46.090
Lloyd's a good man, Doc Owens.
Really, he is.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.394
He just don't trust doctors.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.368
Not since his sister died.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.769
Is there a tonic I can take for this anemia?

02:53.873 --> 02:56.603
There is a tonic, but eating vegetables
would be much more effective.

02:56.709 --> 02:59.405
Lloyd doesn't really like
all those vegetables.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.106
He prefers his meat and potatoes.

03:09.422 --> 03:14.382
Take two spoonfuls twice a day
and come and see me in a week.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.725
It's very important
that my comin' to see you is kept private.

03:17.830 --> 03:21.129
What goes on between a doctor and a patient
is always very private.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.838
- Hello, Lee.
- Hey there, Reverend.

03:35.949 --> 03:38.474
You leaving that bronc of yours
saddled all day?

03:38.585 --> 03:41.884
I'm just trying to wear him down
for the ride home.

03:41.988 --> 03:43.922
You're here early. You're here late.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.423
Sometimes I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.551
Aren't you expecting company?

03:48.661 --> 03:51.221
My wife's best friend from medical school.
She should get here any day now.

03:51.331 --> 03:53.128
I was referring to that apprentice of yours.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.463
He should be here on Thursday's stage.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.059
I'll leave you to your work, Lee.

03:58.171 --> 04:01.629
You have a good day, Reverend.

04:03.276 --> 04:05.574
All finished?

04:05.678 --> 04:08.841
That'll be $2.00 for the doctor
and 50 cents for the medicine.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.822
I'm sorry..
My husband doesn't allow me any extra money.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.762
I have to use the sock money I've saved up.

04:25.865 --> 04:29.164
Why don't we just call it a dollar even?

04:29.269 --> 04:31.829
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

04:31.938 --> 04:35.430
Don't mention it, Mrs. McQueen.

04:35.642 --> 04:37.974
Tell her I'll be by with that medicine.

04:38.077 --> 04:40.307
I will. Absolutely.
It's very good to see you.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.644
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.
- Now, you take care of yourself.

04:43.750 --> 04:46.719
- Okay.
- All right, pal.

04:48.721 --> 04:52.282
Let's have a nice, easy ride today. Okay?

04:55.061 --> 04:58.428
I don't want any more
of that funny business.

05:00.500 --> 05:04.300
Here it comes. Easy.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.339
Whoa! Hey!

05:07.440 --> 05:10.534
- Everybody get inside!
- Settle down now. Settle. Settle.

05:10.643 --> 05:14.135
Easy now.

05:14.247 --> 05:17.512
I guess we're still in the learning process.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.812
Come on.

05:19.919 --> 05:21.944
That was a close one.

05:31.864 --> 05:34.662
Aunt Annie's here.

05:36.102 --> 05:38.662
- Aunt Annie!
- Oh, Lillian, my love.

05:38.771 --> 05:40.932
Oh!

05:41.040 --> 05:43.270
She looks wonderful, doesn't she, pa?

05:43.376 --> 05:45.844
Sure. She, uh, looks very round.

05:45.945 --> 05:48.436
I'm so glad you and Uncle Peter are here.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.016
- Oh, let me get that.
- Oh, it's fine.

05:51.117 --> 05:54.985
Every.one treats me like a China doll.
I'm not gonna break.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.456
- I'm so glad you came.
- Me too.

06:00.059 --> 06:01.959
I can't tell you how much I appreciate...

06:02.061 --> 06:04.086
you looking after Annie while I'm away.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.165
I didn't wanna take a surveying job...

06:06.265 --> 06:09.393
this close to her having the baby,
but we need the money.

06:09.502 --> 06:12.528
- I'll be back in plenty of time.
- Put your mind at ease, Pete.

06:12.638 --> 06:15.732
- We're happy to have her.
- My mother would have stayed with Annie.

06:15.842 --> 06:19.710
But I wanted to come visit my best friend
and her family before the baby comes.

06:19.812 --> 06:22.804
- And we're so glad you did.
- How are things down at the clinic?

06:22.915 --> 06:26.749
Broken bones and bee stings.
Anything a nursing student can handle.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.287
Don't let her fool you, Aunt Annie.
The town loves Ma.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.916
- They wouldn't know what to do without her.
- Those are very kind words.

06:33.025 --> 06:35.619
But they're hardly true.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.969
How about I start cleaning, and, Lee,

06:37.970 --> 06:40.756
you'll help them get
settled in for the night?

06:53.312 --> 06:57.305
It's, uh- It's good having Annie here.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.510
It is.

06:59.619 --> 07:01.519
She's your best friend, isn't she?

07:01.621 --> 07:04.089
I like to think of you
as my very best friend.

07:04.190 --> 07:07.253
Why don't you tell
your very best friend where you are?

07:07.254 --> 07:08.183
I'm right here.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.422
Well, you seem like
you're a hundred miles away.

07:11.531 --> 07:14.830
- I'm just tired.
- Are you sure that's all there is to it?

07:16.302 --> 07:18.964
- What's wrong?
- I'm not pregnant.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.437
Don't worry yourself about it.

07:21.541 --> 07:23.475
We've tried for so long.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.942
We have more than we can handle with Lil.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.479
Oh, I know, but-

07:30.349 --> 07:32.442
It's just that
when Annie found out the news...

07:32.552 --> 07:35.112
it made me want a baby of our own even more.

07:35.221 --> 07:37.712
- Mm-hmm.
- And...

07:37.824 --> 07:40.384
now that she's staying with us-

07:40.493 --> 07:42.461
No.

07:45.231 --> 07:48.792
We are gonna have
a beautiful baby of our own.

07:48.901 --> 07:51.199
All good things come in God's time...

07:51.304 --> 07:54.899
and... maybe we should just let him decide.

07:55.007 --> 07:57.066
What if he doesn't want us to have a baby?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.010
Hey.

08:08.120 --> 08:10.145
Come on.

08:10.256 --> 08:13.316
Let's go help Lil finish the dishes. Hmm?

08:23.870 --> 08:27.306
I guess I'd best be leaving now.

08:27.406 --> 08:29.374
Peter, please be careful.

08:29.475 --> 08:33.035
Yes. My level and compass
are dangerous pieces of equipment.

08:33.145 --> 08:35.113
- I love you.
- I love you too.

08:38.985 --> 08:42.284
Bye, ladies.
Take good care of my Annie.

08:42.388 --> 08:44.515
Will do.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.592
Step up!

08:54.467 --> 08:57.766
Boy, are you all right?

08:57.870 --> 09:01.806
Hyah! Hold 'em!

09:01.908 --> 09:03.808
Ho!

09:07.313 --> 09:10.874
Hup! Ho! Ho! Easy.

09:12.418 --> 09:14.318
Well, about time, isn't it?

09:14.420 --> 09:16.320
- The bags.
- Got it.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.754
Check on the team.

09:18.858 --> 09:22.385
- Welcome home, darlin'.
- Oh, it's beautiful.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.759
How was the trip?

09:24.864 --> 09:26.764
Just lovely.

09:33.072 --> 09:35.563
- You must be Joshua Coil.
- Yes, sir.

09:35.675 --> 09:39.133
Lee Owens.
Welcome to Sikeston. How was your trip?

09:39.245 --> 09:42.169
Couldn't believe how far
it was just to get here.

09:42.170 --> 09:43.807
Nothing but wide open spaces.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.146
- This your first time away from home?
- Yes, sir.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.345
Well, Sikeston's a nice little town.

09:48.454 --> 09:50.684
- I hope you like it.
- I expect so.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.520
- Can I help you with your things?
- Don't have much.

09:54.794 --> 09:57.354
All right. Come on.
Let me show you the shop.

09:57.463 --> 09:59.954
Sounds good.

10:00.066 --> 10:02.728
So we do a little bit of everything here.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.269
Livery work and rolling stock.

10:05.371 --> 10:08.568
Custom work for the building trade.

10:08.674 --> 10:12.209
When your blows are even and you can work a straight piece of metal,

10:12.210 --> 10:13.509
those will be your tools.

10:13.613 --> 10:18.050
It's hard work, but we manage to make
something that lasts a generation or two.

10:18.150 --> 10:20.175
It gives you a sense of pride.

10:20.286 --> 10:22.481
I reckon that's true.

10:22.588 --> 10:26.217
What do you say? You ready to get started?

10:26.325 --> 10:28.793
- Yes, sir.
- All right then.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.293
How was your walk?

10:38.404 --> 10:41.816
Like carrying around a
30-pound sack of flour.

10:41.817 --> 10:42.397
Slow day?

10:42.508 --> 10:45.477
Oh, I'm sure it's only a matter of time
before someone comes in...

10:45.578 --> 10:48.843
from getting caught on a rusty nail
or falling off a ladder.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.041
When I was traveling
through Selena last month...

10:51.150 --> 10:54.017
there was a rash of copperhead snakebites.

10:54.120 --> 10:57.055
It felt like every day
someone was dragged into the clinic.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.353
I haven't had anything
as exciting as a snakebite in months.

11:00.459 --> 11:03.917
You should be grateful
to have a healthy community to serve.

11:04.030 --> 11:08.057
It's our job as doctors to care about even
the most minor illness or affliction.

11:08.167 --> 11:12.103
And our patients deserve
and need our compassion.

11:12.204 --> 11:15.196
That's right out of a textbook.

11:15.307 --> 11:18.276
Belinda, are you sure there isn't anything
you'd like to talk to me about?

11:18.377 --> 11:20.436
You can tell me anything. You know that.

11:22.615 --> 11:26.517
What is it?

11:26.619 --> 11:31.716
It's a quick, sharp pain and a
shortness of breath and minor faintness.

11:31.824 --> 11:34.224
- Let's get you to an examination room.
- It's not necessary.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.386
- Is the baby moving?
- It isn't that.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.522
It's nothing to be concerned about.

11:40.633 --> 11:44.296
Let me finish some things up,
and we'll get you home.

11:48.908 --> 11:52.275
You know, my pa says walking's good
for a man's constitution.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.278
You always walk?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.780
Well, lately, I've been riding.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.646
- You walking on my account?
- No. No.

11:59.752 --> 12:02.414
I got a horse to give to Lillian...

12:02.521 --> 12:05.490
but he's still a little green and testy.

12:05.591 --> 12:09.391
I've been breakin' him,
gettin' ready for her to ride.

12:09.495 --> 12:12.396
I figured I'd give him and me the day off.

12:12.498 --> 12:15.797
I know nothing of saddle horses,
only a harness pro.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.597
- I stick with wagons.
- You're better for it.

12:20.506 --> 12:23.600
I really wish you would just sit down
after what happened today.

12:23.709 --> 12:27.076
- What happened today?
- Absolutely nothing to be concerned about.

12:27.179 --> 12:29.147
And that's coming from the doctor in me.

12:29.248 --> 12:31.182
When you go home,
who will deliver your baby?

12:31.283 --> 12:33.410
My mother-in-law. She's a midwife.

12:33.519 --> 12:36.079
Well, I wish I was the one
delivering your baby.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.156
It's a doctor's job after all.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.487
I'm sure it's gonna be fine.

12:42.394 --> 12:46.023
Ladies, if you don't mind,
I brought home a guest for supper.

12:48.134 --> 12:50.034
Ahh. Ah.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.267
And you must be Joshua. Welcome to our home.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.706
- It's very nice to meet you, Mrs. Owens.
- Uh, that's ‘‘Dr. Owens."

12:59.278 --> 13:00.194
You're a doctor?

13:00.195 --> 13:02.941
Yes, as is my best
friend, Dr. Annie Watson.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.107
It's a pleasure to meet you, Joshua.

13:05.217 --> 13:09.711
Ma'am. It's funny. I just had no idea women
were allowed to be doctors.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.017
- Allowed?
- No. I just-

13:12.124 --> 13:13.961
And just who would
we need permission from?

13:13.962 --> 13:14.922
Go easy on him, Lil.

13:15.027 --> 13:19.487
He just got here. I'm sure he's aware
of what women can accomplish. Hmm?

13:19.598 --> 13:22.328
Apparently not.

13:23.903 --> 13:28.033
That's our daughter, Lillian.
We raised her to speak her mind.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.506
You'll get used to it.

13:30.609 --> 13:35.706
Well, now, let's go get washed up.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.908
It smells like my favorite.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.077
- Well, she certainly is your daughter.
- Indeed.

13:54.433 --> 13:56.924
- Miss Owens?
- Mr. Coil.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.903
I just want you to know...

14:01.006 --> 14:03.839
I meant no disrespect earlier.

14:03.943 --> 14:06.844
I would express an opinion,
but I'm not sure I'm allowed.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.676
Well, I'd very much like to
hear your opinions.

14:10.816 --> 14:12.716
I think you're very old-fashioned.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.718
Women can pursue any career
they want these days.

14:14.820 --> 14:16.720
They already have female lawyers,
doctors and ministers.

14:16.822 --> 14:18.790
A town in Kansas even had a woman mayor.

14:18.891 --> 14:22.452
Well, I have no objections to your mother
and aunt being doctors. I swear.

14:22.561 --> 14:27.589
It's just-
Well, I've never met a lady doctor before.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.602
I'm apologizing.
I guess I'm just not doing a very. Good job.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.865
Apology accepted.

14:37.643 --> 14:41.602
- Well, I 'll leave you to your schoolwork.
- Well, this isn't for school.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.692
So you read for fun?

14:42.693 --> 14:45.480
I'd read just about all day
if Ma and pa would let me.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.052
Well, all right.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.644
I'll leave you to your book, Miss Owens.

14:53.592 --> 14:55.560
Good night, Mr. Coil.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.066
- Nice young man.
- I hadn't noticed.

15:15.114 --> 15:18.572
- Good night, pumpkin.
- Good night, pa.

15:31.297 --> 15:33.959
Come in.

15:36.368 --> 15:39.201
- How are you?
- I feel fine.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.312
- Is everything all right?
- I can't get pregnant.

15:53.419 --> 15:56.786
Belinda, you're young and healthy.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.857
It may just take some time.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.553
It's just- I think Lee is so disappointed.

16:02.661 --> 16:05.528
- Have the two of you talked about it?
- Yes.

16:05.631 --> 16:08.099
And he says he's fine
with the way our lives are.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.532
But recently,
he's been at work more than ever.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.763
His business is booming.

16:12.871 --> 16:14.805
He's had to hire help.

16:14.907 --> 16:17.273
You're probably right.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.123
I'm really glad you're
back and we can talk again.

16:20.124 --> 16:21.039
Me too.

16:23.682 --> 16:26.014
- Oh!
- Annie, what is it?

16:26.118 --> 16:29.144
It's that pain again.

16:29.254 --> 16:31.484
And it's more severe this time.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.558
Oh, I feel light-headed.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.191
Belinda, I think something is really wrong.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.178
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I believe so.

17:33.285 --> 17:37.483
- The baby?
- He should be fine for now.

17:40.993 --> 17:44.952
Annie thinks it was preterm labor,
but I just don't know.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.089
- Why?
- I think it's eclampsia.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.963
That sounds serious. What is it?

17:50.069 --> 17:53.061
It's a condition of pregnant women,
but it's not well understood.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.231
What makes you think that Annie has it?

17:55.340 --> 17:57.831
Well, the symptoms
include muscle aches and pain...

17:57.943 --> 18:01.640
severe agitation,
unconsciousness, seizures.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.478
- Did she have a seizure?
- No, but she has all the other symptoms.

18:05.584 --> 18:08.985
Well, I'll telegraph Peter first thing in
the morning, tell him what's happened.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.000
Thank you.
And let him know I think it's best...

18:10.000 --> 18:11.147
You're Watching 123Movies.to
Thank you.
And let him know I think it's best...

18:11.147 --> 18:11.256
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:11.256 --> 18:13.747
that Annie stay here
for the remainder of her pregnancy.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.747 --> 18:13.859
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:13.859 --> 18:17.295
- Bed rest is crucial.
- While I'm at it, I'll wire his mother.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.295 --> 18:17.396
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:17.396 --> 18:20.456
- You said she lives in Spartan?
- Thank you.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:20.456 --> 18:22.000
You're Watching 123Movies.to

18:24.036 --> 18:27.267
Do you really think this is necessary?

18:27.372 --> 18:30.432
Total rest for you, Mrs. Watson,
and a dark room is conducive to rest.

18:30.542 --> 18:34.478
To being lazy, you mean.
I cannot just lay around all day.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.174
- I'm a doctor, remember?
- But I'm your doctor.

18:37.282 --> 18:41.275
And this is my home. And if it is eclampsia,
you know bed rest is called for.

18:41.386 --> 18:43.877
- Don't you think you're overreacting?
- Perhaps.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.787
But if I'm not, I won't be sorry later.

18:46.892 --> 18:50.794
- I love you.
- I love you too.

18:57.736 --> 18:59.829
A pear for my peach.

19:01.840 --> 19:04.468
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay home with Aunt Annie?

19:04.576 --> 19:06.976
No. You just run along to school.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.980
I'll post a note on the clinic. If someone
really needs me, they know where to find me.

19:10.082 --> 19:13.518
- Morning, ladies.
- Good morning.

19:13.619 --> 19:15.712
- Bye, Ma.
- Have a good day, darlin'.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.085
- Bye, pa.
- Bye.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.988
That girl kicks up a cloud of dust
everywhere she goes.

19:22.094 --> 19:24.824
Here you go.

19:24.930 --> 19:28.093
Is this your way of telling me
not to come home for supper?

19:28.200 --> 19:30.134
The other one is for Joshua.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.514
A young man just starting off-

19:31.515 --> 19:33.432
look like he could use
a few more good meals.

19:33.539 --> 19:37.202
- Do you have any idea how much I love you?
- It never hurts to hear it.

19:37.309 --> 19:39.243
Come here.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.815
I love you too, Lee Owens.

19:43.916 --> 19:46.972
Oh, and don't forget
to send the telegrams.

19:46.973 --> 19:47.875
All right.

19:47.986 --> 19:50.284
Have a good day, sweet darlin'.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.464
‘‘Belinda feels Annie's
health as well as the baby's...

20:02.568 --> 20:06.368
‘‘is better served staying here
until after the delivery..

20:06.471 --> 20:09.872
I wired Peter the same message. Lee Owens."

20:20.018 --> 20:22.782
- Doc Owens.
- Mr. McQueen.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.823
I 'm sorry. We're closed today.
But if you'd like to make an appointment-

20:25.924 --> 20:27.847
Were you the one that
gave Mabel this tonic?

20:27.848 --> 20:29.257
Yes. It's iron for her anemia.

20:29.361 --> 20:32.296
Why you got to go telling her
she's got this and that condition?

20:32.397 --> 20:34.388
What she has is a spell of laziness.

20:34.499 --> 20:38.094
Mabel is sick, Mr. McQueen.
Give her that medicine.

20:38.203 --> 20:40.171
I don't need your magic potion.

20:40.272 --> 20:42.706
A doctor killed my sister with tonic.

20:42.808 --> 20:46.266
I don't know the details
of your sister's death.

20:46.378 --> 20:49.176
But there's no magic to it.
Your wife had a baby a month ago...

20:49.281 --> 20:51.977
and she has a very serious
medical condition.

20:52.084 --> 20:54.075
Maybe if you weren't so hardheaded,
you would realize that.

20:54.186 --> 20:57.485
- Now, my advice-
- I don't need your mouth nor your advice.

20:57.589 --> 21:01.150
And I don't need your magic potion.
Doctors aren't worth a hootin' howl!

21:01.260 --> 21:03.228
Hey, boy!

21:05.564 --> 21:07.657
Are you all right, Belinda?

21:07.766 --> 21:11.429
Yes. I'm just frustrated
at a very stubborn and hardheaded man.

21:11.536 --> 21:14.164
Lloyd McQueen is truly set in his ways...

21:14.273 --> 21:16.298
but he's still a child of our maker.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.774
He has no compassion
for his wife's condition.

21:18.877 --> 21:21.175
Can't we all get caught up
in our own lives at times...

21:21.280 --> 21:24.807
and lose sight of the compassion
we should have for others?

21:24.916 --> 21:26.941
There I go preaching again.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.782
Oh, it's all right.
I suppose I needed to hear it.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.789
I'll see you in church, Belinda.
Good day.

21:44.436 --> 21:46.336
That's it. Steady blows.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.065
All right.

21:52.844 --> 21:56.405
Your daughter seems very smart, Mr. Owens.
It must run in the family.

21:58.517 --> 22:00.610
Oh, I wish I could take credit
for Lillian's intelligence.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.687
But she was adopted.

22:02.788 --> 22:05.313
- But still, I couldn't be prouder.
- Really?

22:05.424 --> 22:07.892
- Yeah.
- I never would've known.

22:07.993 --> 22:11.895
I mean, she and Mrs.-
I mean, Dr. Owens- sorta look alike.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.988
Is that a fact?

22:14.099 --> 22:17.830
Well, yeah.
I mean, it's just- Lillian's very pretty.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.427
Yeah, I know she's pretty.

22:32.651 --> 22:34.551
I'm truthfully not that hungry..

22:34.653 --> 22:36.746
Doctor's orders.

22:36.855 --> 22:40.052
Even if you don't feel up to it,
you need to finish the entire bowl.

22:40.158 --> 22:42.126
I'm not a child, Belinda.

22:42.227 --> 22:44.218
And I'm a doctor. I know what's best for me.

22:44.329 --> 22:47.093
Knowing and doing
are two entirely different things.

22:47.199 --> 22:50.930
Is that another contraction?

22:51.036 --> 22:52.534
No. The baby's just kicking.

22:52.535 --> 22:54.995
And I have to tell you.
I'm a little relieved.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.541
I haven't felt him move
since the contractions yesterday.

22:57.642 --> 23:00.202
You just said it was... h-he?

23:00.312 --> 23:02.280
How do you know it's a boy?

23:02.381 --> 23:04.349
I know it sounds silly...

23:04.449 --> 23:07.577
but Mary thinks because
I'm carrying so low that it'll be a boy.

23:07.686 --> 23:11.417
It is silly. That's an old wives' tale.
There's no medical merit to it.

23:11.523 --> 23:14.492
Say what you want,
but when Peter's sister was pregnant...

23:14.593 --> 23:17.653
Mary was concerned because
she was carrying so far out in front.

23:17.763 --> 23:20.561
She said it would be a breech birth,
and she was right.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.725
One lucky guess,
and she's got you believing made-up stories.

23:23.835 --> 23:26.736
Goodness, he's getting his exercise today.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.238
- Do you wanna feel?
- That's all right.

23:29.341 --> 23:32.777
Come on, Belinda. Don't be nervous.

23:35.447 --> 23:39.144
It's so strange.
I never thought I'd be a mother.

23:39.251 --> 23:43.517
Now it suddenly feels like
the most natural thing in the world.

23:46.258 --> 23:50.422
I'm sorry.
I've opened that wound, haven't I?

23:50.529 --> 23:53.191
Maybe we shouldn't talk about it.

23:53.298 --> 23:56.699
You know, I know so many women that
have gotten pregnant without even trying.

23:56.802 --> 23:58.770
And Lee and I have been trying.

23:58.870 --> 24:00.963
We've both seen it take some time.

24:01.072 --> 24:04.337
You just can't get impatient with yourself.

24:04.443 --> 24:07.503
I look after this woman, Mabel McQueen.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.979
She's had six babies in the past eight years
without even trying.

24:11.082 --> 24:14.017
It's important to you, isn't it?

24:17.789 --> 24:19.757
I'd best get supper ready.

24:19.858 --> 24:21.792
Lee and Lillian will be home soon.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.862
I'm here to talk whenever you'd like to.

24:26.064 --> 24:28.328
Please eat your soup, Annie.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.710
I was wondering where you'd run off to.

24:49.020 --> 24:52.387
I just looked in on Annie.
She's out for the night.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.925
She keeps insisting she feels fine.

24:56.862 --> 25:00.764
I think I've heard that before.

25:00.866 --> 25:03.096
You two are so much alike, it's frightening.

25:04.603 --> 25:07.153
I suppose that's why
we're such good friends.

25:07.154 --> 25:08.004
Hmm.

25:08.106 --> 25:11.405
I notice you didn't have Joshua over
for supper tonight.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.944
Well, I'm pretty sure he's sweet on Lil.

25:14.045 --> 25:17.879
I don't want the two of them
spending too much time together.

25:17.983 --> 25:20.213
Why not? He's only a couple years older.

25:20.318 --> 25:24.015
Doc, he's an apprentice blacksmith.
I want better for Lillian.

25:24.122 --> 25:27.114
I'm the wife of a blacksmith,
and you don't hear me complaining.

25:27.225 --> 25:31.218
I spent the last five years trying to figure out
how I tricked you into marrying me.

25:31.329 --> 25:34.765
- You could've done much better.
- You didn't trick me into anything.

25:34.866 --> 25:38.632
I married you
because I fell in love with you, Lee Owens.

25:38.737 --> 25:41.729
And if Lillian and Joshua
have taken an interest in one another...

25:41.840 --> 25:44.240
I don't think it's our place
to stand in their way.

25:44.342 --> 25:47.175
Besides, telling Lillian
she can't have something...

25:47.279 --> 25:50.407
is like daring to try to stop her.

25:53.385 --> 25:54.877
I get your point.

25:54.878 --> 25:57.116
I don't wanna get in
the way of her happiness.

25:57.222 --> 26:02.455
Still, you left a small town
to follow your dream.

26:02.561 --> 26:06.588
And if Lil wants to go to college,
I darn sure wanna see it happen.

26:06.698 --> 26:09.667
I don't want her tied down to Sikeston.

26:09.768 --> 26:14.000
I hope she knows
what a wonderful and caring father she has.

26:16.508 --> 26:20.171
You know, it's getting a little chilly.
Wanna turn in for the night?

26:20.278 --> 26:22.644
No, you go ahead.
I'll be up in a little while.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.833
Don't be in such a hurry, pretty lady.

26:46.404 --> 26:49.635
- Please allow me to pass.
- Uh-uh. We need to get to know each other.

26:51.409 --> 26:54.606
I think not.
I don't wanna be late for school.

26:54.713 --> 26:57.238
Oh, I can teach you
more than any school can.

26:57.349 --> 27:00.682
Excuse me.
You mind letting the young lady pass?

27:00.785 --> 27:03.151
This ain't none of your affair, sod buster.

27:03.254 --> 27:06.052
- Ah, but it is.
- It ain't.

27:06.157 --> 27:08.216
Oh, dear, what-

27:08.326 --> 27:10.726
What's going on here?

27:10.829 --> 27:14.321
- I'm gonna knock your head off, boy.
- Now, you hold on a second.

27:14.432 --> 27:16.662
Now, the good book tells me
to turn the other cheek.

27:16.768 --> 27:19.794
Now, I only have two.
So after the second, I'm on my own.

27:26.011 --> 27:28.673
- That was the second cheek.
- You're breaking my wrist.

27:28.780 --> 27:30.714
Well, I understand
there's a fine doctor in town.

27:30.815 --> 27:33.340
No. Please don't. Please don't break it.

27:33.451 --> 27:35.652
I trust I'll never see
you around Miss Owens again.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.386
No. Never.

27:36.488 --> 27:40.857
Good. Now get.

27:49.200 --> 27:52.192
Good morning, Miss Owens.
You were on your way to school?

27:52.303 --> 27:54.498
Indeed I am.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.904
May I walk with you?

28:03.481 --> 28:05.449
I did the best I could, Jim.

28:05.550 --> 28:09.384
But you got to go easy on her, all right?

28:19.364 --> 28:22.094
Your pa strikes me as a hardworking man.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.293
He lives and breathes work.

28:24.402 --> 28:26.165
Ma says sometimes he
rolls over in his sleep

28:26.166 --> 28:27.929
and tries to use her
arms like a set of tongs.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.906
I guess that's the future
I have to look forward to.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.500
It's not such a bad life really.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.774
So what about you?

28:37.882 --> 28:40.373
You gonna become a doctor like your ma?

28:40.485 --> 28:43.045
I don't know. I haven't decided.

28:43.154 --> 28:46.749
Maybe I wanna be a lawyer or a
famous writer like Harriet Beecher Stowe.

28:46.858 --> 28:48.826
One thing for sure- I wanna go to college.

28:48.927 --> 28:51.760
Well, I'd better get to work.

28:51.863 --> 28:56.300
- Have a nice day, Joshua.
- You too, Lillian.

29:05.744 --> 29:08.645
I don't think you should be
climbing the stairs.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.681
But I feel fine.

29:10.782 --> 29:13.444
What's making me crazy
is sitting in a dark room all day.

29:13.551 --> 29:16.645
But it's only been three days
since you had pain and felt faint.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.985
You know the symptoms and treatment
as well as I do.

29:19.090 --> 29:21.991
That's assuming your diagnosis is correct.

29:25.463 --> 29:27.294
Is that singing?

29:27.398 --> 29:30.026
I would know that voice anywhere.
That's Mary.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.763
Your mother-in-law?
What reason does she have to be here?

29:32.871 --> 29:35.806
Mary doesn't need a reason to do anything.

29:46.918 --> 29:50.854
Well, this must be it.

29:50.955 --> 29:53.014
Whoa, Tee.

29:53.124 --> 29:55.024
Thank you, my good man.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.492
And you have a blessed day.

29:57.595 --> 30:02.362
And you must be the infamous Doc Owens.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.231
- Infamous?
- Mary Watson.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.566
Oh, but you knew that already.

30:07.672 --> 30:10.641
Now, where is my peach pie?

30:10.742 --> 30:13.711
Oh, would you be a dear
and bring my things along?

30:17.215 --> 30:21.481
Mary, what are you doing here?

30:21.586 --> 30:24.521
Well, where else would you expect me to be?
Oh, my little lamb.

30:24.622 --> 30:27.420
But didn't you get the telegraph
from Belinda's husband?

30:27.525 --> 30:29.459
I did. That's why I'm here.

30:29.561 --> 30:32.496
I have nothing against you finishing out
your term with your friend.

30:32.597 --> 30:37.227
But I certainly wasn't going to miss
the birth of my first grandson.

30:37.335 --> 30:39.303
I've missed you.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.981
Ah, it's darker than the
inside of a cow in here.

30:41.982 --> 30:42.703
Yes, it is.

30:42.807 --> 30:44.707
Oh, please don't do that.

30:44.809 --> 30:47.869
Well, she's not a mushroom.
She needs light.

30:47.979 --> 30:51.608
All right, darlin', let's sit up
so I can get a good look at you.

30:51.716 --> 30:53.616
- I'm sorry. What are you doing?
- I'm getting her upright.

30:53.718 --> 30:56.585
If she stays in this bed too long...

30:56.688 --> 30:59.680
she'll get a crick in her back,
and it'll make delivery much more painful.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.624
I think it's better that she's on bed rest
for the remainder of her term.

31:02.727 --> 31:05.890
It's not gonna hurt her to sit up.

31:05.997 --> 31:09.592
When you've delivered as many babies
as I have, you learn a few things.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.862
Well, I've been to
medical school for years...

31:11.970 --> 31:13.938
and rest is the proper treatment.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.973
You don't learn everything
in medical school.

31:17.075 --> 31:20.567
That is a matter of opinion,
and I wholeheartedly disagree.

31:20.678 --> 31:24.114
Ladies, I'm not a sack of flour.

31:30.355 --> 31:34.485
There I was in the middle
of the worst blizzard I ever saw.

31:34.592 --> 31:37.288
I wasn't too surprised...

31:37.395 --> 31:41.161
when three babies were delivered that night.

31:41.266 --> 31:45.566
- I expected twins, not triplets.
- I n a blizzard?

31:45.670 --> 31:49.470
Oh, the little ones pop out whenever
they want, regardless of the weather.

31:49.574 --> 31:52.509
Fortunately, I don't have many emergencies.

31:52.610 --> 31:56.808
Women giving birth are always an emergency.

31:56.915 --> 32:01.352
That's the penalty we pay
for Eve eating the apple.

32:01.452 --> 32:02.730
It is not a penalty.

32:02.731 --> 32:06.116
Wow, Mrs. Watson.
You sure got an exciting life.

32:06.224 --> 32:09.660
Well, I should
probably get you up to your room, Annie.

32:09.761 --> 32:12.525
You let that little fella
start running your life now...

32:12.630 --> 32:15.258
you'll be lacing his shoes when he's 30.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.664
Yes. Annie told me you believe it's a boy.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.930
Believe nothing. It's a fact.

32:20.038 --> 32:22.131
Honestly, Mary., you can't possibly-

32:22.240 --> 32:24.367
Actually, I am a little tired.

32:24.475 --> 32:26.602
I'm gonna go to bed.

32:26.711 --> 32:29.407
I can manage on my own.

32:29.514 --> 32:31.414
Good night, all.

32:31.516 --> 32:33.416
- Good night, Annie.
- Rest well, dear.

32:33.518 --> 32:36.112
- Good night, Aunt Annie.
- Good night, Annie.

32:39.424 --> 32:43.224
- There is no way to tell whether-
- It's time we all settled down.

32:43.328 --> 32:46.126
Huh? We have a full day tomorrow.

32:51.235 --> 32:53.635
Thank you for dinner, Dr. Owens.

32:54.906 --> 32:58.307
Joshua. Lillian told us
that you came to her rescue.

32:58.409 --> 33:00.309
Her mother and I both appreciate it.

33:00.411 --> 33:04.211
It was my pleasure, sir. Thank you again.

33:05.450 --> 33:07.418
I'll walk you out.

33:17.161 --> 33:21.757
Aren't they the most adorable couple?

33:21.866 --> 33:25.927
So tell me.
How was Captain Nemo this evening?

33:26.037 --> 33:28.505
When I left him,
he was exploring the ruins of Atlantis...

33:28.606 --> 33:31.734
although I can't say for sure what he does
when I'm not looking.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.505
I never met a girl that made a book
sound so interesting.

33:34.612 --> 33:37.103
- Well, you can borrow it if you like.
- No, no.

33:37.215 --> 33:39.445
I'm not sure if I'm sold on Nemo just yet.

33:39.550 --> 33:41.575
Maybe you could read
some of it to me though.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.277
Just so I can find out
if it's my kind of story.

33:44.278 --> 33:45.281
I could do that.

33:45.390 --> 33:48.382
Would you like to go on a picnic with me?

33:48.493 --> 33:53.089
Maybe on Saturday we can go out
and find a nice, quiet spot and read.

33:53.197 --> 33:56.132
I think I know just the place.

33:56.234 --> 33:58.532
Lee Owens,
you are not spying on our only daughter.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.104
I'm not spying on her.
I'm just looking out for her.

34:08.079 --> 34:10.239
Good night.

34:29.300 --> 34:31.598
Let's see what you've got there.

34:31.702 --> 34:34.899
- Well?
- You're, uh-You're really improving.

34:35.005 --> 34:38.304
Thank you, sir.
I'm trying my best to impress you here.

34:38.409 --> 34:42.539
Well, as long as it's me
you're trying to impress.

34:44.315 --> 34:47.681
Well, to be honest, I wanted to ask you...

34:47.784 --> 34:50.481
maybe, um...

34:50.588 --> 34:53.716
- Lillian and I-
- You want permission to court Lillian.

34:53.824 --> 34:56.817
- Right?
- Yes, sir.

34:56.928 --> 34:59.419
Well, I don't want it
to distract her from her goals.

34:59.530 --> 35:03.364
Well, I promise I'll be respectful of her
and not get in the way of her schooling.

35:03.468 --> 35:05.766
I know how much she wants to go to college.

35:05.870 --> 35:09.863
Well, I'll think about it. All right?

35:09.974 --> 35:12.738
- I understand.
- In the meantime...

35:12.844 --> 35:15.312
finish up with that horseshoe.

35:15.413 --> 35:17.881
- Eli wants this order by noon.
- Yes, sir.

35:19.183 --> 35:21.913
You're gonna be late opening your clinic.

35:22.019 --> 35:24.283
I don't feel comfortable
leaving Annie here all alone.

35:24.388 --> 35:27.448
And I certainly don't feel comfortable
with her being out of bed this much.

35:27.558 --> 35:31.187
I wish the two of you wouldn't talk about me
as if I wasn't sitting right here.

35:31.295 --> 35:34.196
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

35:34.298 --> 35:39.326
You must be so frustrated
cooped up inside all the time.

35:39.437 --> 35:42.565
I will be here with her all day.

35:42.673 --> 35:46.666
You tend to your patients,
and we'll see you at supper.

35:49.313 --> 35:53.181
- If you need anything, I'll be close by.
- Thank you.

35:54.318 --> 35:56.582
Have a nice day.

35:58.356 --> 36:02.918
Praise the Lord! We're free.

36:03.027 --> 36:05.621
peach pie, you get dressed.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.392
We are going out to smell the roses.

36:10.568 --> 36:12.763
Oh! Going to town.

36:12.870 --> 36:14.770
Ah!

36:19.210 --> 36:22.737
Doc Owens? Can I talk to you?

36:22.847 --> 36:25.179
Mrs. McQueen, come in.

36:27.585 --> 36:30.179
I only have a minute.
I left Lloyd at the general store.

36:30.180 --> 36:31.681
Said I was running to the butcher.

36:31.789 --> 36:34.758
- What can I do for you, Mabel?
- Doc, I feel terrible.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.157
This sickness, it's just getting worse.

36:37.261 --> 36:39.729
I'm dizzy all the time,
and I can barely pick up the young 'uns.

36:39.830 --> 36:42.697
That's because your anemia's getting worse.
Your body needs iron.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.598
- You're only gonna get sicker.
- Well, what can I do to make it better?

36:45.703 --> 36:48.103
I already told you. Vegetables or the tonic.

36:48.206 --> 36:51.369
If you don't listen to my instructions,
there is nothing more I can do.

36:51.475 --> 36:55.309
I tried to take the tonic. Really, I did.
Even started to feel a little stronger.

36:55.413 --> 36:59.247
And then Lloyd found it,
and you know the rest.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.477
I certainly do. He threw a bottle at me.

37:01.586 --> 37:05.613
I'm sorry for that. Really, I am. He was
just upset. He didn't mean anything by it.

37:05.723 --> 37:08.419
He's a wonderful husband and a father.

37:08.526 --> 37:10.000
Maybe. But I can't help you
if you won't help yourself.

37:10.000 --> 37:12.223
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
Maybe. But I can't help you
if you won't help yourself.

37:12.223 --> 37:16.567
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:16.567 --> 37:19.058
Good day, Mrs. McQueen.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:19.058 --> 37:22.000
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

37:37.922 --> 37:41.483
Your friend Belinda doesn't seem too happy.

37:41.592 --> 37:43.651
I'd say it's just that
she doesn't like me...

37:43.761 --> 37:46.662
but everybody likes me.

37:46.764 --> 37:48.994
She isn't happy.

37:49.100 --> 37:51.295
She's been trying to have a baby.

37:51.402 --> 37:53.768
Belinda just feels discouraged.

37:53.871 --> 37:58.137
And me showing up in my condition
and staying till the baby comes...

37:58.242 --> 38:01.143
I think it's just another painful reminder.

38:01.245 --> 38:03.873
Why didn't you say something sooner?

38:03.981 --> 38:07.781
If it's baby trouble she's got,
I've surely got the cure.

38:08.953 --> 38:12.286
How about a sugary treat?

38:12.390 --> 38:14.324
Okay.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.893
I'm sorry, Lloyd. It isn't here yet.

38:16.994 --> 38:19.895
It's been over a week.
You said it'd be here by now.

38:19.997 --> 38:22.192
The freight line lost the shipping order.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.791
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- There's something I could do...

38:24.902 --> 38:27.632
if there was another general store
within 10 miles of here.

38:27.738 --> 38:29.865
It'll be here within a week.

38:29.974 --> 38:32.238
I'm here, Lloyd.

38:33.577 --> 38:35.545
What took you so long?

38:35.646 --> 38:37.944
I'm sorry, Lloyd.
There was a little bit of a line.

38:38.049 --> 38:40.210
There's always an excuse.
Let's get out of here.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.253
I've got fences to mend before sundown.

38:43.354 --> 38:47.313
- It's not fair.
- She's-

38:47.425 --> 38:48.915
- Annie!
- My goodness!

38:49.026 --> 38:51.551
- That man!
- Ma'am?

38:51.662 --> 38:54.995
- Ma'am?
- She's just feelin' poorly of late.

38:55.099 --> 38:59.001
She's got a newborn and five young 'uns.
Says it wears her out.

38:59.103 --> 39:01.731
You think a mother doesn't work?

39:01.839 --> 39:06.538
I've seen this a bunch
during and after pregnancy.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.874
This is a severe case of anemia.

39:08.979 --> 39:12.437
She don't need coddlin', lady!
I know how to take care of my wife!

39:12.550 --> 39:14.677
No, you don't!

39:14.785 --> 39:17.618
You are selfish...

39:17.722 --> 39:19.781
and rude and contemptuous.

39:19.890 --> 39:22.290
And you can't see the forest for the trees.

39:22.393 --> 39:25.851
Doc Owens is trying
to save your wife's life.

39:25.963 --> 39:28.659
She's dying.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.929
You get her over to the clinic...

39:32.036 --> 39:34.596
and you beg Doc Owens
for more of that tonic.

39:34.705 --> 39:38.641
- Don't talk to me like that.
- I'll talk to you anyway I want-

39:38.743 --> 39:41.234
Get her to the clinic.

39:42.713 --> 39:44.681
I admire women like that.

39:44.782 --> 39:48.548
And you better pray
to the merciful and good Lord...

39:48.652 --> 39:53.817
that she doesn't slam
the door in your ungrateful face!

39:53.924 --> 39:57.155
Amen. Amen.

40:07.972 --> 40:11.581
I gave you a double dose,
so do not take any more today.

40:11.582 --> 40:12.341
No, ma'am.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.877
Starting tomorrow morning,
take two teaspoons every morning.

40:14.979 --> 40:17.971
And if you don't get your strength back
in four days, get back in here.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.955
I'd like to apologize.

40:25.055 --> 40:27.751
The last time we spoke, I lost my temper.

40:27.858 --> 40:30.326
What do I owe you for the tonic?

40:30.428 --> 40:32.419
Only that you allow her to keep taking it.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.498
We don't need no charity.

40:34.598 --> 40:37.032
The first one was already paid for.
This is just a replacement.

40:39.069 --> 40:41.037
Step up!

40:54.084 --> 40:57.281
Yes, dear.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.447
I'm sorry. Are you sleeping?

40:59.557 --> 41:02.321
Well, not anymore.

41:02.426 --> 41:06.123
My apprentice wants to court Lillian.

41:06.230 --> 41:09.199
His name is Joshua.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.962
I told him I'd think about it.

41:12.069 --> 41:14.037
Well, then think.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.800
But don't think too long.

41:16.907 --> 41:20.343
- Lillian's grown up.
- I'm having a hard time with it.

41:20.444 --> 41:22.674
You're having a hard time
letting her grow up.

41:22.780 --> 41:24.805
I'm just trying to protect her.

41:24.915 --> 41:27.941
I don't think she needs protection
from Joshua.

41:28.052 --> 41:30.577
He's a very nice young man.

41:30.688 --> 41:32.883
That's all you have to say about it.

41:32.990 --> 41:35.686
Good night, sweetheart.

41:39.296 --> 41:42.231
All right.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.531
Tomorrow I'll give Joshua
my permission to court Lil.

41:58.616 --> 42:01.346
Don't think I don't know
about your little excursion with Annie.

42:01.452 --> 42:05.252
This town is filled with gossips. You can't
keep a secret for more than five minutes.

42:05.356 --> 42:08.086
It's a pretty little town, Sikeston.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.752
I can see why you like it here.

42:10.861 --> 42:12.522
May I ask why you feel the need

42:12.523 --> 42:15.093
to go against every
instruction I have for Annie?

42:15.199 --> 42:18.930
I don't deliberately go against your word.

42:19.036 --> 42:23.530
- We just disagree about how to treat her.
- This isn't a competition.

42:23.641 --> 42:27.168
If a patient came to you
with gangrene or pneumonia...

42:27.278 --> 42:29.712
I wouldn't dream of telling you
how to treat them.

42:29.813 --> 42:31.974
That's your business.

42:32.082 --> 42:36.542
Babies are my business.
Have been for 30 years.

42:36.654 --> 42:39.589
It's just that there's been
so many new advancements.

42:39.690 --> 42:41.988
Sometimes the old ways are best.

42:42.092 --> 42:45.550
Annie may have a serious condition which
could be fatal to both her and the baby.

42:45.663 --> 42:46.267
Are you sure?

42:46.268 --> 42:48.962
Of course I'm not sure,
but I'm not taking any chances.

42:49.066 --> 42:53.799
So it's true what they say
that doctors only practice medicine.

42:56.173 --> 42:59.074
This conversation obviously
isn't getting us anywhere.

43:01.612 --> 43:03.773
So Annie tells me you're barren...

43:03.881 --> 43:05.849
or, uh- or having trouble anyway.

43:05.950 --> 43:08.544
I don't think that's any of your concern.

43:08.652 --> 43:10.984
I see this problem a lot.

43:11.088 --> 43:14.057
If you want, I can give you some remedies
that are guaranteed to work.

43:14.158 --> 43:15.479
I know how it's done, Mary.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.924
I don't think there's
anything wrong with you.

43:18.028 --> 43:22.397
- So, what do you think is the problem?
- You're too high-strung.

43:22.499 --> 43:25.866
Folks worry too much about work, family...

43:25.970 --> 43:28.268
or whether or not they can have a baby.

43:28.372 --> 43:31.671
Then years go by and nothing happens.

43:31.775 --> 43:34.266
Then one day they decide to stop trying...

43:34.378 --> 43:38.474
and before you know it,
they find they're with child.

43:38.582 --> 43:42.177
So your sage advice for me is to relax.

43:42.286 --> 43:45.153
Read a book before you go to bed.

43:45.255 --> 43:48.281
Take some deep breaths.

43:48.392 --> 43:51.520
And before you know it,
I'll be back to deliver your little one.

43:51.629 --> 43:54.325
I'll make sure I'll try that.

44:12.316 --> 44:16.685
Every baby boy needs his own blanket.
Don't you agree?

44:16.787 --> 44:19.813
Yes, I do.

44:24.161 --> 44:27.597
I'm gonna head to the shop for a few hours.
I'll be back in time for supper.

44:27.698 --> 44:29.893
Don't you ever take time off?

44:30.000 --> 44:32.935
Well, the good book says that a man
who doesn't work doesn't deserve to eat.

44:33.037 --> 44:34.937
And I got a lot of work to do.

44:35.039 --> 44:37.701
We just thought you'd have more time off
once you hired an apprentice.

44:37.808 --> 44:40.276
And I do. Now I'm only two weeks behind
instead of six.

44:43.614 --> 44:46.174
Lillian, you look lovely.
Where you headed off to?

44:46.283 --> 44:48.751
Joshua and I are having a picnic.

44:48.852 --> 44:52.083
You enjoy yourself.
And please, tell Joshua that we said hello.

44:52.189 --> 44:52.531
I will.

44:52.532 --> 44:55.124
You be back in time for
supper now, no exceptions.

44:55.225 --> 44:56.749
I will. I promise.

44:58.462 --> 45:00.521
- Bye, everyone.
- Bye, dear.

45:14.845 --> 45:17.075
‘‘I love it. The sea is everything.

45:17.181 --> 45:20.742
‘‘It covers seven-tenths of the terrestrial
globe. Its breath is pure and healthy.

45:20.851 --> 45:23.820
‘‘It is an immense desert
where man is never lonely...

45:23.921 --> 45:26.151
‘‘for he feels life stirring on all sides.

45:26.256 --> 45:30.192
‘‘The sea is the only embodiment
of the supernatural and wonderful existence.

45:30.294 --> 45:32.319
‘‘It is nothing but love and emotion.

45:32.429 --> 45:35.762
It is the ‘Living Infinite,'
as one of your poets has said."

45:37.534 --> 45:39.900
I've been reading for almost two hours.
You must be bored.

45:40.003 --> 45:42.801
No. I don't think I can ever get bored
listening to you talk.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.931
You're just saying that.

45:45.042 --> 45:47.806
No, I'm not. I swear. It's just-

45:47.911 --> 45:51.574
I'd like this Captain Nemo if he weren't
holding his friends hostage all the time.

45:51.682 --> 45:54.810
Well, he can't let them go.
They might tell the world who he is.

45:54.918 --> 45:57.182
20,000 Leagues is an allegory.
It's about personal freedom.

45:57.287 --> 45:58.802
"Nemo" means "nobody" in Latin.

45:58.803 --> 46:01.781
He's invisible to the world
and wants to keep it that way.

46:01.892 --> 46:03.689
You're brilliant. You know that?

46:03.794 --> 46:05.694
I am not.

46:12.870 --> 46:15.304
Lee, you working today?

46:17.775 --> 46:20.039
You work harder than any man I know.

46:20.144 --> 46:23.807
I can't let the customers down.
Besides, it gives me thinkin' time.

46:23.914 --> 46:26.178
Anything that you'd like
to share with your pastor?

46:28.485 --> 46:31.181
Just a lot of rumblin' around in my head
like a marble.

46:31.288 --> 46:33.188
Sometimes it helps to speak it out loud.

46:33.290 --> 46:36.691
Talking to yourself
only gets the answer you're looking for.

46:36.794 --> 46:39.058
Just can't figure Lillian out.

46:40.330 --> 46:42.662
I'm trying to be a good father to her, but-

46:42.766 --> 46:47.169
Our children grow up,
start spreading their wings.

46:47.271 --> 46:51.765
A father has to be aware of that
and try to grow with his child.

46:51.875 --> 46:54.537
Yeah. Belinda tolerates more than I do.

46:54.645 --> 46:55.486
She's a mother.

46:55.487 --> 46:58.012
The good Lord gave them
the patience of Job...

46:58.115 --> 47:00.379
when it comes to raising their children.

47:00.484 --> 47:02.418
He shortchanged fathers in that area.

47:02.519 --> 47:06.888
Yeah. Yeah.

47:10.160 --> 47:12.754
I really wish you would get some rest.

47:12.863 --> 47:15.627
I feel fine.

47:15.732 --> 47:18.360
Looks like someone may have been wrong
about my condition.

47:18.468 --> 47:21.198
Perhaps.

47:21.305 --> 47:23.535
So, have things improved with Lee?

47:23.640 --> 47:26.541
He says he isn't bothered, but...

47:26.643 --> 47:29.612
I still sense that he's disappointed
we can't have a baby.

47:29.713 --> 47:31.787
Well, maybe you're just
being overly sensitive

47:31.788 --> 47:33.376
and you think that he's disappointed.

47:33.483 --> 47:35.041
Maybe.

47:35.152 --> 47:38.451
You know, I'm starting to think
that maybe she regrets marrying me.

47:38.555 --> 47:42.423
Now, Lee, that is just plain nonsense.

47:42.526 --> 47:44.687
She's proud as a peacock
that she married you.

47:44.795 --> 47:48.196
- Maybe.
- Have you spoken to her about it?

47:48.298 --> 47:52.598
Uh, in a roundabout way.
Of course she says I'm wrong.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.728
But still, she seems kind of distant lately.

47:54.838 --> 47:59.036
She's got something on her mind.
Most women do when they get like that.

47:59.142 --> 48:02.236
Hmm. You know, we're, uh...

48:03.380 --> 48:06.008
trying to have a baby.

48:06.116 --> 48:09.279
- So far, no luck.
- You have to have faith.

48:10.387 --> 48:12.287
Sometimes it's hard, Reverend.

48:12.389 --> 48:16.985
Talk to her about your feelings.

48:17.094 --> 48:18.346
I best be getting home.

48:18.347 --> 48:21.394
Mrs. Davis will give me an
earful if I'm late for supper.

48:21.498 --> 48:24.490
Yeah, myself included.

48:29.439 --> 48:31.737
Well, I see...

48:31.842 --> 48:34.310
you didn't need my help
putting supper on the table.

48:34.411 --> 48:37.505
- You were taking a nap, Mary.
- We just wanted you to be able to rest.

48:37.614 --> 48:40.174
I'll rest enough when I'm dead!

48:40.284 --> 48:43.082
Give me that knife before you cut yourself.

48:49.559 --> 48:51.550
So, do you miss your family?

48:51.662 --> 48:55.564
I do. My pa's a farmer back in Pennsylvania.

48:55.666 --> 48:58.260
He wanted more for me
than spending my entire life plowing fields.

48:58.368 --> 49:03.032
So he said if l got good enough,
maybe I can find some work in Philadelphia.

49:03.140 --> 49:05.040
Sounds like he cares about you a lot.

49:05.142 --> 49:08.373
Yeah, my family's pretty close.

49:08.478 --> 49:12.437
It's kind of strange though,
you know, being out here all by myself.

49:12.549 --> 49:15.609
I have three sisters and two brothers
and not a moment of peace.

49:15.719 --> 49:18.119
Back at the boardinghouse
I got nothin' but quiet.

49:18.221 --> 49:21.213
I know what you mean.
I mostly grew up in an orphanage...

49:21.325 --> 49:23.919
until Ma and pa adopted me when I was 10.

49:24.027 --> 49:28.691
I'd spent so long in a room with other kids
I couldn't wait to have a room of my own.

49:28.799 --> 49:32.462
- Now I miss having someone to talk to.
- You have me.

49:32.569 --> 49:35.163
I do, don't I?

49:37.574 --> 49:39.701
So tell me something.

49:39.810 --> 49:42.677
How'd you ever find a place
like this anyway?

49:42.779 --> 49:44.906
I stumbled across it by accident
while riding one day.

49:45.015 --> 49:48.382
And it's so far off the main road,
so no one really comes out here.

49:48.485 --> 49:53.650
So I brought some of my old stuff,
and now it's where I come to be alone.

49:53.757 --> 49:55.418
I can see why.

49:55.525 --> 49:59.086
Captain Nemo had a cave near the ocean
where he went to escape.

49:59.196 --> 50:02.222
This reminds me of it.

50:02.332 --> 50:04.357
- Well, the timber still seems sound-
- I wouldn't do that.

50:04.468 --> 50:06.436
Whoa.

50:08.138 --> 50:10.402
Not as sound as you may think.

50:10.507 --> 50:13.567
Yeah, you're probably right.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.077
I think it's best we pack up.

50:19.683 --> 50:22.243
Well, I'm happy to see
you and Mary are getting along.

50:22.352 --> 50:25.685
You know,
her fertility advice to me was to...

50:25.789 --> 50:28.121
relax and read a book before bed.

50:28.225 --> 50:31.251
- Did you try it?
- Of course not.

50:31.361 --> 50:34.159
She's been doing this longer
than we've been alive.

50:34.264 --> 50:36.425
I can't believe you, Annie Watson.

50:36.533 --> 50:38.524
You've spent three years
in medical school...

50:38.635 --> 50:41.695
five years practicing medicine and you're
gonna believe that woman's folk magic?

50:41.805 --> 50:43.705
It's rubbish, plain and simple.

50:43.807 --> 50:48.267
We ask people to believe in things
they don't understand and they do...

50:48.378 --> 50:52.109
because they have trust and faith in us,
just like they have faith in the Lord.

50:52.215 --> 50:55.116
Okay, it is not the same thing,
and we're talking about Mary here.

50:55.218 --> 50:58.244
Why do you have such a hard time
believing in Mary's ways?

50:58.355 --> 51:01.188
Look, okay, Mary is a lovely woman...

51:01.291 --> 51:03.282
but you have to admit,
she's a little touched in the head.

51:03.393 --> 51:05.987
She doesn't like me anymore than I like her.

51:06.096 --> 51:09.463
Really?
The other day at the general store...

51:09.566 --> 51:11.727
Mary defended you to the ends of the earth.

51:11.835 --> 51:14.463
- What are you talking about?
- The man with the anemic wife?

51:14.571 --> 51:17.233
The one that you said
was such a success story?

51:17.340 --> 51:20.275
Mary is the reason
that he brought her back to you.

51:20.377 --> 51:22.572
That's why Lloyd McQueen
brought his wife back to me?

51:22.679 --> 51:25.341
Mary unloaded on him like a tornado.

51:25.449 --> 51:27.576
Spoke up for you
and just plain made him cower.

51:30.620 --> 51:33.145
Come on. Let's go.

51:35.859 --> 51:37.827
Thank you.

51:39.896 --> 51:42.194
Do you have any idea what time it is?

51:42.299 --> 51:43.926
Hi, pa.

51:44.034 --> 51:45.934
You were supposed to be home for supper.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.766
Joshua and I weren't that hungry, so we
decided to stay out a little while longer.

51:48.872 --> 51:51.306
Well, it's well past supper.
That's more than a little while.

51:51.408 --> 51:52.932
Why are you so angry?

51:53.043 --> 51:55.841
I thought I could trust your judgment,
but apparently I was wrong.

51:55.946 --> 51:58.574
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means you can't spend any more time...

51:58.682 --> 52:00.980
with Joshua Coil until I say so!

52:01.084 --> 52:03.484
You'll go to school, help your mother
at the clinic and come straight home.

52:03.587 --> 52:06.147
- For how long?
- As long as it takes me to trust you again.

52:06.256 --> 52:09.692
That's completely unfair.
Joshua's only two years older than I am...

52:09.793 --> 52:11.818
and no one tells him what to do.

52:11.928 --> 52:14.624
No one said the world was fair, young lady.

52:14.731 --> 52:16.528
Lil?

52:17.901 --> 52:20.870
I was worried about you.

52:41.725 --> 52:44.023
Hello, Joshua.

52:44.127 --> 52:46.220
Good afternoon, ma'am.

52:46.329 --> 52:50.493
Uh, Mr. Owens told me
how much trouble I caused the other night.

52:50.600 --> 52:54.900
I just wanted to come by and say how
sorry I am for keeping Lillian out so late.

52:55.005 --> 52:58.600
You needn't place the blame all on yourself.
She's old enough to know better.

52:58.708 --> 53:01.575
- Well, I'm still sorry.
- Ma, I can't find the-

53:02.779 --> 53:04.906
Bandages.

53:06.483 --> 53:09.850
Pa said I can't see you for a while.

53:09.953 --> 53:12.285
Pa said you couldn't go out with Joshua.

53:12.389 --> 53:15.051
He said nothing about the two of you
seeing each other.

53:15.158 --> 53:17.285
Thanks, Ma.

53:19.763 --> 53:23.859
Well, I have work to do.
It was nice to see you, Joshua.

53:23.967 --> 53:26.629
There's always room open
at the dinner table for you.

53:26.736 --> 53:28.704
Thank you, ma'am.

53:33.543 --> 53:34.908
Sorry to get you into trouble.

53:34.909 --> 53:37.274
You didn't do anything
wrong, and neither did I.

53:37.380 --> 53:41.146
I'm a grown woman and I don't need my pa
deciding how late I can and can't stay out.

53:41.251 --> 53:44.049
- He's just worried about you is all.
- Well, he doesn't need to be.

53:44.154 --> 53:45.973
There's no need to be cross, Lillian.

53:45.974 --> 53:48.284
I'll still be here when
you get off punishment.

53:48.391 --> 53:50.655
I'm not going anywhere.

53:50.760 --> 53:54.491
- I wanted to return this. Finished it.
- Already?

53:54.598 --> 53:56.034
I just gave it to you.

53:56.035 --> 53:59.297
Well, once I got started,
it was hard to quit.

53:59.402 --> 54:01.267
The sun was already up
when I finally closed the book.

54:01.371 --> 54:03.566
So you stayed up all night
just to read about Captain Nemo?

54:03.673 --> 54:07.109
Well, I don't think I would have gotten
much sleep with or without him.

54:10.747 --> 54:13.181
- I'll be thinking about you.
- Me too.

54:32.802 --> 54:36.329
- Mary?
- In here, dear.

54:42.212 --> 54:44.612
- Annie, should you be up?
- Where are you going?

54:46.116 --> 54:50.382
I've decided to head on home.
I can see you're in good hands.

54:50.487 --> 54:53.547
You're leaving? Before the baby comes?

54:53.657 --> 54:56.820
Oh, you'll do fine.

54:56.926 --> 55:00.418
And besides, the last thing you need...

55:00.530 --> 55:03.966
is an old granny midwife
gumming up the works.

55:04.067 --> 55:05.705
This doesn't have anything to do

55:05.706 --> 55:08.470
with the disagreement between
you and Belinda, does it?

55:08.571 --> 55:11.165
Oh, no. No, no.

55:11.274 --> 55:15.836
Truth is... I'm feeling homesick.

55:15.945 --> 55:18.379
I miss sleeping in my own bed.

55:18.481 --> 55:24.044
And my patients back home don't have
a smart lady doctor to take care of them.

55:24.154 --> 55:26.418
If you've made your decision,
I can't stop you.

55:26.523 --> 55:29.788
I'd really love for you to stay though.

55:29.893 --> 55:32.259
I want my family here when the baby comes.

55:32.362 --> 55:35.763
Belinda is your family, sweetheart.

55:35.865 --> 55:38.857
And Peter will be back with you next week.

55:38.968 --> 55:42.131
Besides, all of you
will be home before long...

55:42.238 --> 55:45.366
and somebody's gotta get the house ready.

55:47.043 --> 55:49.944
I'm gonna go home to check on Annie.
I shouldn't be long.

55:50.046 --> 55:53.675
If there's an emergency,
just send them my way or come running.

55:53.783 --> 55:56.411
- Which you're very good at.
- I will, Ma, and thank you.

55:56.519 --> 55:59.044
- For what?
- For understanding about me and Joshua.

55:59.155 --> 56:02.022
Believe it or not, I was your age once.

56:12.902 --> 56:16.269
I'm not gonna keep her from a church social.

56:16.373 --> 56:19.900
You may not be able to go with her,
but you'll see her there.

56:21.544 --> 56:23.910
In the meantime, we have an order to finish.

56:25.415 --> 56:27.940
Well, all right. I like your attitude.

56:34.524 --> 56:36.151
You're leaving.

56:36.259 --> 56:39.626
- Time for me to go home.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

56:39.729 --> 56:41.458
I'm gonna see her off into town.

56:41.564 --> 56:45.432
I don't think it's a good idea for you to be
carrying luggage and walking into town.

56:45.535 --> 56:47.503
It was my idea, Belinda.

56:47.604 --> 56:50.471
And I've been all over this whole territory
through my entire pregnancy.

56:50.573 --> 56:53.474
I think I can handle a short walk into town.

56:53.576 --> 56:55.771
Doc Owens!

56:57.547 --> 56:58.069
Danny.

56:58.070 --> 57:02.246
Lillian told me you was here.
Ma's in labor.

57:02.352 --> 57:04.752
Okay, there's a horse and buggy in the barn.
Help me hook it up.

57:04.854 --> 57:06.822
Yes, ma'am.

57:08.291 --> 57:10.000
I trust you won't walk into town
while I'm away?

57:10.000 --> 57:10.657
You're Watching 123Movies.to
I trust you won't walk into town
while I'm away?

57:10.657 --> 57:12.162
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:12.162 --> 57:16.792
All right, peach pie,
you get back in the house and stay put.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.792 --> 57:16.900
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:16.900 --> 57:19.869
Belinda and I have a baby to deliver.
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.869 --> 57:19.969
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:19.969 --> 57:22.000
- Mrs. Travis is my patient.
- If you find you don't need me...
You're Watching 123Movies.to

57:22.000 --> 57:24.531
- Mrs. Travis is my patient.
- If you find you don't need me...

57:24.641 --> 57:27.041
you have my permission
to just shove me out of the way.

57:27.143 --> 57:30.271
But if you do, I'm there.

57:32.582 --> 57:35.449
Fine, but only because
I don't have time to argue with you.

57:44.961 --> 57:46.929
Thank you, young man.

57:51.267 --> 57:52.412
It's never taken this long.

57:52.413 --> 57:54.703
The first few hours seemed
normal, but then it stopped.

57:54.804 --> 57:56.965
- What stopped, the contractions?
- No.

57:57.073 --> 57:57.632
Doc, the baby.

57:57.633 --> 57:59.507
It's like it's stuck,
but I can't see the head.

57:59.609 --> 58:03.705
- I'll see to it.
- Your mama's gonna be fine.

58:05.281 --> 58:08.307
- It's a fetal dystocia.
- A what?

58:08.418 --> 58:10.648
- The baby's shoulder is stuck.
- What are you fixin' to do with that?

58:10.753 --> 58:13.085
We have to get the baby out
before it suffocates.

58:13.189 --> 58:16.317
If we start pulling,
we could make things worse.

58:16.426 --> 58:18.894
What should we do?

58:18.995 --> 58:22.726
Well, if you can't
get the baby out from the inside...

58:22.832 --> 58:24.732
you try from the outside.

58:24.834 --> 58:26.734
All right, help me with her now.

58:26.836 --> 58:29.327
- That's good.
- What are we doing?

58:29.439 --> 58:32.931
We're gonna flatten out her hipbones.

58:33.042 --> 58:36.443
Now, Mrs. Travis, lay down for me.

58:36.546 --> 58:39.879
Now, we're gonna see
who's stuck and who's not.

58:51.361 --> 58:53.556
There.

59:04.974 --> 59:07.738
It's gonna be all right.

59:12.382 --> 59:15.613
Pa?

59:15.718 --> 59:17.481
Pa?

59:19.656 --> 59:22.887
Hello, Joshua. Where's my pa?

59:22.992 --> 59:26.393
He's on delivery and then headed home.

59:26.496 --> 59:29.397
I'd sure like to go to the ice cream social.

59:29.499 --> 59:33.401
- I'd sure like to ask you to go with me.
- So?

59:33.503 --> 59:37.940
Your pa said I could see you there,
but I can't escort you.

59:38.041 --> 59:40.407
I'm sorry..

59:55.258 --> 59:56.725
Joshua.

59:58.161 --> 01:00:01.289
Pa is being so unreasonable.

01:00:01.397 --> 01:00:03.297
We were late coming home, okay?

01:00:03.399 --> 01:00:06.926
Don't tell me you're on his side?
What's the difference in an hour or so?

01:00:07.036 --> 01:00:09.596
We got home just fine.
He just doesn't trust me.

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:11.072
Your pa had no way of knowing

01:00:11.073 --> 01:00:14.040
whether you were all right when
you didn't make it home on time.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:17.670
You sound just like Pa.
Ma is the only one who understands.

01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:20.681
Lily, wait a second.

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.856
Hyah! Giddyap! Hyah!

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.561
Hyah!

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:51.638
It's a beautiful baby boy,
and your wife is fine.

01:00:51.748 --> 01:00:53.306
- Can I see them?
- Shortly.

01:00:56.886 --> 01:01:00.447
Well, it looks like we got ourselves
a baby brother.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.825
- Isn't he beautiful?
- He sure is.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:15.026
He'd better be.
Leave it to a boy to jam up the works.

01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:29.474
Uh, that's not doctor's work.

01:01:29.585 --> 01:01:32.349
It doesn't matter who does it,
just as long as it gets done.

01:01:36.926 --> 01:01:39.394
I learned something today
that they didn't teach me in medical school.

01:02:22.605 --> 01:02:25.005
All right, whoa. Whoa.

01:02:32.415 --> 01:02:34.747
Whoa.

01:02:36.385 --> 01:02:38.478
- You seen Lillian?
- No. Why?

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:41.284
We thought she might be with you.
She's been missing all afternoon.

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:44.325
We got into an argument at the shop
over Mr. Owens and she stormed off.

01:02:44.427 --> 01:02:46.327
Said you were the only one
who understands her.

01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:49.592
We were hoping she'd run off to find you.

01:02:49.699 --> 01:02:52.259
She rode off on that crazy horse
I bought for her.

01:02:52.368 --> 01:02:55.860
It's about to get dark outside.
If she gets stuck in the country.side-

01:02:55.972 --> 01:02:58.497
I think I know where she is.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:07.276
Come on.

01:03:13.923 --> 01:03:16.551
Are you all right?

01:03:16.659 --> 01:03:19.628
It's worse this time.
I feel like I could faint.

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:22.061
Okay, okay. Let's get her inside.

01:03:22.165 --> 01:03:26.397
It looks as if the doctor
was right about bed rest.

01:03:59.101 --> 01:04:02.070
- How much further?
- It's just up ahead.

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.744
How are you feeling?

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:15.944
I'm really not as light-headed as before.
I'd like to just go to bed.

01:04:16.052 --> 01:04:20.352
Let's get you upstairs to a darkened room.
Doctor's orders.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.534
Whoa, ho.

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:59.420
- Was it like this before?
- No, sir.

01:04:59.528 --> 01:05:02.463
It looks like there was a cave-in.
She might be hurt.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.733
This is one of her lamps.

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:09.396
Come on. Let's go. Lil!

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.473
Lil!

01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:21.008
- It's right up there.
- I see her.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:24.776
Lil!

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.483
Lil! Give me a hand with this.

01:05:29.592 --> 01:05:31.787
One, two, three.

01:05:33.863 --> 01:05:35.626
I got it.

01:05:35.731 --> 01:05:37.358
- You got it?
- I got it.

01:05:37.466 --> 01:05:40.924
Lil? Lil. Lil.

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:44.268
Come on. Talk to me, pumpkin.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:52.603
- pa?
- Yeah. I'm here, honey.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.845
Just take it easy. You stay down, all right?

01:05:59.588 --> 01:06:01.783
- We're gonna get you out of here.
- Okay.

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:26.108
How's Lillian?

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:28.183
A few cuts and bruises...

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:31.845
but nothing that won't heal nicely.

01:06:31.954 --> 01:06:35.822
She's out for the night.
Lee is sitting with her for a while.

01:06:35.925 --> 01:06:39.656
Give her a couple of days.
She'll be right as rain.

01:06:39.762 --> 01:06:41.855
At that age, nothing keeps them down.

01:06:41.964 --> 01:06:45.923
Well, I think her ego has suffered
more than her body.

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:48.333
Ah. This, too, shall pass.

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:55.670
Children are just so resilient, aren't they?
True miracles.

01:06:55.778 --> 01:06:58.076
Are you still fretting
about the baby making?

01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:01.445
I don't think I'll be making babies
anytime soon, Mary.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:04.246
Hmm. Give it up if you want...

01:07:04.353 --> 01:07:06.446
but I'm telling you...

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:11.390
the shine in your hair
is not the mark of a barren woman.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:13.394
You don't really believe that, do you?

01:07:13.496 --> 01:07:16.260
Doesn't matter what I believe.
Only matters what you believe.

01:07:16.365 --> 01:07:17.547
What do you mean?

01:07:17.548 --> 01:07:21.928
Medicine isn't the only thing
that makes people feel better.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:25.599
It's believing that they can be better.

01:07:27.109 --> 01:07:30.442
I'm sorry I doubted you.
You didn't deserve it.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:34.346
The Lord says we are to forgive...

01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.918
if we expect to be forgiven.

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:41.649
Make me some fresh bacon and eggs
in the morning and all is forgiven.

01:07:41.757 --> 01:07:43.918
That's a promise.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.633
Late night tonight. Every.one's worn out.

01:07:56.739 --> 01:07:58.934
Lil's sleeping like a pup.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:06.981
You know...

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:10.348
I think I might read a book
before bed tonight.

01:08:10.453 --> 01:08:13.479
Really? You never read in bed.

01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:17.957
I think it'll do me good. Help me unwind
after the long day we've all had.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:20.028
Hmm.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.300
Doc.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.428
I've been thinking about us
trying to have a baby.

01:08:29.537 --> 01:08:33.167
Lil's changed our lives
in so many wonderful ways...

01:08:33.274 --> 01:08:38.178
and I'm sure there's plenty of children down
at the orphanage who need a good home.

01:08:38.279 --> 01:08:41.613
You mean, you'll still be happy
even if we can't have children of our own?

01:08:41.716 --> 01:08:45.517
I'll be happy as long as I'm with you.

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:47.850
I always have been and always will be.

01:08:50.593 --> 01:08:53.255
Do you think my hair is shiny?

01:08:55.430 --> 01:08:58.524
Yeah. Yeah, like the sunrise.

01:09:02.171 --> 01:09:05.004
I do love you, Mr. Owens.

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:07.473
I love you too.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:08.345
Good night.

01:09:08.346 --> 01:09:11.706
Oh, all right.
You gonna read your book now?

01:09:11.814 --> 01:09:14.078
Okay.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:18.313
All right, I'll just go to sleep.

01:09:25.027 --> 01:09:27.518
You sure I can't help you read it or- No?

01:09:27.630 --> 01:09:29.825
All right.

01:09:37.939 --> 01:09:40.305
Shouldn't you be in bed?

01:09:40.408 --> 01:09:43.572
My ball and chain let me come downstairs.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.408
She has her mind set on going
to the ice cream social.

01:09:46.515 --> 01:09:50.952
What if l find a shady, comfortable place
to just sit and eat ice cream?

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:54.545
- You are not going to the social.
- I am a doctor. I vote yes.

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:59.094
Well, that's one vote for Dr. Annie
and one vote for the midwife.

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.926
I guess you've got
the tie-breaking vote, Doc.

01:10:04.366 --> 01:10:07.733
I'm sorry., Annie. I'm gonna have
to side with the midwife.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.532
- But I love ice cream.
- Then I'll send you some.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:11.863
It's not the same.

01:10:11.864 --> 01:10:13.699
How do I know you're not
gonna sneak out when we're gone?

01:10:13.809 --> 01:10:16.744
Don't give it a second thought, Doc.

01:10:16.845 --> 01:10:20.941
This old ball and chain will be sitting
right here like a prison warden.

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:24.713
- You're both against me.
- That's right. Read your book and pout.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:39.496
Don't you look beautiful.

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:42.230
- Except for this.
- Oh, no one will even notice that.

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:45.273
- Even Joshua?
- Especially Joshua.

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:49.105
Thanks for telling Joshua
he can escort me to the social.

01:10:49.211 --> 01:10:51.236
You're still coming
with your mother and I, right?

01:10:51.347 --> 01:10:53.941
I told him I wanted to walk in with
my family and see him from afar.

01:10:54.049 --> 01:10:58.611
- That's very romantic.
- It must be from all the books I read.

01:10:58.721 --> 01:11:04.523
Pa, I'm sorry for not making curfew
the other night.

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:06.686
I know you were just worried about me.

01:11:06.795 --> 01:11:09.195
Don't worry about it.

01:11:09.298 --> 01:11:11.926
You're growing up so fast,
sometimes I can't keep up with you.

01:11:12.034 --> 01:11:13.626
Thanks, pa.

01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.727
Come here.

01:11:29.285 --> 01:11:30.980
And then you step like this.

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:38.721
Here you go.

01:11:38.827 --> 01:11:41.819
Mr. Owens, Dr. Owens,
would you like some lemonade?

01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:43.955
- No, thank you.
- No, thank you, Joshua.

01:11:50.973 --> 01:11:53.134
Hey, partner, how's your ice cream?

01:11:53.242 --> 01:11:56.405
Doc Owens, can we talk?

01:11:56.512 --> 01:11:58.878
Lloyd, I believe you know my husband Lee?

01:11:59.848 --> 01:12:02.510
- Lloyd.
- I wanna thank you.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:06.554
Mabel is as different as night and day.
It's all I can do to keep up with her.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:10.648
- Well, you do look like a brand-new person.
- I've had a lot more energy.

01:12:10.759 --> 01:12:12.799
I still need some extra
sleep in the afternoons,

01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:14.160
but getting stronger everyday.

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:16.129
Well, the best medicine is no good...

01:12:16.130 --> 01:12:18.700
if it isn't dispensed or
received with a joyful spirit.

01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:24.495
- It's all too easy to forget that.
- Well, I, uh...

01:12:24.606 --> 01:12:28.064
mostly want to apologize
for being... stubborn.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.441
- Thanks again, Doc Evans.
- It was my pleasure.

01:12:30.546 --> 01:12:34.573
And I should be the one
to apologize to you, Mabel.

01:12:34.683 --> 01:12:38.119
I had no right to be cross with you
when you needed my help.

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.348
- I hope you can forgive me.
- There's nothing to forgive.

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:43.118
Thank you.

01:12:43.225 --> 01:12:45.489
Have a good day.

01:12:48.797 --> 01:12:53.530
Well, now, that was
a very nice thing you just did.

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:56.297
- You like some ice cream?
- I'd love some.

01:13:07.850 --> 01:13:09.613
Whoa!

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:16.224
I got Lee's telegram. Where's Annie?

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:20.193
The Lord brought you at the right time.
Everyone's in town at a social.

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:23.162
- I need Belinda now.
- I want to see Annie.

01:13:23.265 --> 01:13:26.757
Get Belinda now!

01:13:26.869 --> 01:13:29.133
Hoo-hoo. Hyah!

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:34.266
- You look beautiful.
- So do you- handsome.

01:13:36.311 --> 01:13:39.769
- I still can't believe it.
- Can't believe what?

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:43.943
Well, that I'm here with the smartest,
most beautiful girl in town.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.080
That's very sweet of you to say, Joshua.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:03.636
Lillian's got a boyfriend.
Lillian's got a boyfriend.

01:14:03.739 --> 01:14:07.539
Lillian's got a boyfriend.
Lillian's got a boyfriend.

01:14:07.643 --> 01:14:10.669
Gracie, Shannon,
you go on and get out of here.

01:14:18.854 --> 01:14:21.049
Belinda, Doc Owens, I need you!

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:24.821
Whoa! Whoa.

01:14:27.396 --> 01:14:29.023
- Belinda!
- Peter.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:31.395
It's Annie! You gotta come quick.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:34.401
Joshua, you see to it
that Lillian gets home safe.

01:14:34.402 --> 01:14:35.368
Yes, sir.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:37.962
- Hyah! Hyah!
- Stand back.

01:14:38.073 --> 01:14:40.132
Hyah! Hyah!

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:47.308
- Mary.
- Thank God you're back.

01:14:47.416 --> 01:14:51.113
She's had a seizure. I've got her in bed.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:55.452
Pete, you best wait down here.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.923
There's nothing you can do up there.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:09.235
Dear Lord, please watch over Annie
and her baby.

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:15.343
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:19.706
- Thank you, Lee.
- You're welcome.

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:21.840
Come on. Let's have a seat.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.928
- Peter.
- He's waiting downstairs.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.436
Right. Is it eclampsia?

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:43.801
I'm afraid so.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:48.865
Please save my baby.

01:15:48.977 --> 01:15:51.377
You know what you have to do.

01:15:58.186 --> 01:16:00.620
I'm gonna close my eyes now.

01:16:13.602 --> 01:16:16.935
What did she mean,
you know what has to be done?

01:16:17.039 --> 01:16:20.338
That baby has to come out
if we're to save it...

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:22.603
even at the risk of her own life.

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.941
That baby is ready.

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:27.845
She was talking about a cesarean delivery...

01:16:27.950 --> 01:16:31.613
which I could do at the clinic,
but under very crude conditions.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.214
- Have you ever done one?
- I did one once at a hospital in Boston...

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:41.285
but I had the proper equipment and staff,
and there wasn't eclampsia involved.

01:16:41.396 --> 01:16:44.058
Is there no other choice?

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:46.532
Not if she doesn't go into labor soon.

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:51.504
Well, then, we best get that labor going.

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:56.707
What is that?

01:16:56.812 --> 01:17:00.270
Scotch broom with a little vanilla
to help it go down.

01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:04.785
- Women have been using it for centuries.
- Scotch broom is a weed?

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:09.346
A weed the good Lord made.
His wonders to perceive.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:12.859
- Does it work?
- As sure as the sunrise.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.861
A little of this...

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:19.127
and we'll have our baby boy in no time.

01:17:22.437 --> 01:17:25.338
- Is there anything else I can do?
- A glass of water.

01:17:59.741 --> 01:18:02.471
Her temperature is slightly raised...

01:18:02.577 --> 01:18:04.602
but her heartbeat
and her breathing are normal.

01:18:04.713 --> 01:18:06.613
No contractions yet.

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:11.049
It doesn't seem to be working.
It's never taken this long.

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:14.122
Let's just give it a little more time.

01:18:14.222 --> 01:18:16.690
We could lose Annie and the baby.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:22.025
Do you have everything here
that you need to do a Caesarian delivery?

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:30.070
How about taking a spoonful
of that faith you're always talking about?

01:18:34.109 --> 01:18:36.407
I'm gonna make some tea.
Would you like a cup?

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.945
No, thank you.

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:55.224
- Any news?
- Nothing yet.

01:18:55.330 --> 01:18:57.298
I'm going to have a cup of tea.

01:19:17.419 --> 01:19:20.149
You're doing fine, Annie.
Just keep breathing.

01:19:20.255 --> 01:19:23.418
Okay.

01:19:23.525 --> 01:19:25.755
Contractions, closer together.

01:19:25.861 --> 01:19:30.525
We are going to introduce
this baby boy to his new family.

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:32.964
It's all right. It's all right.

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:36.526
Good job. Keep breathing. Good, good.

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.021
Congratulations, Uncle Peter.

01:20:06.434 --> 01:20:09.403
She's so beautiful.

01:20:09.504 --> 01:20:10.000
I've delivered hundreds of babies...

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:11.472
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!
I've delivered hundreds of babies...

01:20:11.472 --> 01:20:11.573
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:11.573 --> 01:20:14.542
but I've never seen one this... perfect.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.542 --> 01:20:14.643
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:18.010
And I'm not just saying that
because she's my granddaughter.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:18.010 --> 01:20:18.113
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:18.113 --> 01:20:21.378
I thought she was a boy.
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.378 --> 01:20:21.483
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:21.483 --> 01:20:22.000
She carried like a boy.
But we live and learn, don't we, Doc?
Thank You for Watching Movies on 123Movies.to website!

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.714
She carried like a boy.
But we live and learn, don't we, Doc?

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.084
We sure do.

01:20:27.189 --> 01:20:31.421
- Thank you both for being here.
- There's no other place we'd rather be.

01:20:33.361 --> 01:20:36.194
Is it okay if I come in?

01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:44.097
Come meet your daughter, Peter.

01:20:49.711 --> 01:20:51.679
Can I hold her?

01:20:51.780 --> 01:20:53.577
Come sit.

01:21:23.345 --> 01:21:26.178
- Whoa.
- Hey, you got that, fella?

01:21:26.281 --> 01:21:29.114
- I brought you a present.
- A present?

01:21:29.217 --> 01:21:32.482
These are a few of my favorites.

01:21:32.587 --> 01:21:36.284
When I asked you for a few books,
I thought you'd give me one or two.

01:21:36.391 --> 01:21:39.417
Well, the way you went through 20,000
Leagues, I figured you could use a few more.

01:21:39.527 --> 01:21:41.654
Oh, you think so?

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:45.765
I should probably get going.

01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:48.165
Okay. Will I see you later?

01:21:49.304 --> 01:21:51.670
As sure as this is one fine day.

01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:06.145
Joshua, when you're finished
swooning over my daughter...

01:22:06.254 --> 01:22:11.021
- I could use a little help in here.
- I 'm comin'.

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:14.653
Lord, thank you for the family
that surrounds us...

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:17.323
and the love which envelopes us.

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:20.367
May we always strive
to walk the way you like...

01:22:20.468 --> 01:22:23.835
and be true missionaries of your word.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.907
Amen.

01:22:34.983 --> 01:22:36.321
Hey, are you all right?

01:22:36.322 --> 01:22:39.113
I 'm fine.
It's just a little stuffy inside.

01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:41.346
I've gotten so used to
you being at the house,

01:22:41.347 --> 01:22:43.156
it's gonna be too
quiet when you're gone.

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:46.244
Well, it's been a week since
my darling daughter was born.

01:22:46.245 --> 01:22:47.661
I think it's time we go home.

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:50.128
I'm gonna miss you so very much.

01:22:50.231 --> 01:22:53.496
And all the more reason for you
to come visit us soon.

01:22:58.073 --> 01:22:59.451
What are you doing out here?

01:22:59.452 --> 01:23:02.305
I was just getting some fresh air
and talking to Annie.

01:23:02.410 --> 01:23:05.470
You're gonna miss her, aren't you?

01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:08.174
Well, we have her for one more night.

01:23:08.283 --> 01:23:10.911
Let's enjoy her while we can.

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:21.754
- Thank you very much, Lee.
- Oh, it was my pleasure, Pete.

01:23:21.863 --> 01:23:24.730
And, Belinda, I can never thank you enough.

01:23:24.833 --> 01:23:28.428
Well, I wish I could take all the credit,
but I had some expert help.

01:23:29.871 --> 01:23:32.362
This has been the happiest time of my life.

01:23:32.474 --> 01:23:35.298
I'm so glad that I got
to share this with you.

01:23:35.299 --> 01:23:36.240
Me too.

01:23:36.344 --> 01:23:39.336
All aboard, folks! We're burning daylight.

01:23:39.447 --> 01:23:43.178
I think it's about that time.
Will you hold baby Linda for me?

01:23:43.284 --> 01:23:45.878
Of course.

01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:57.022
- Bye, you two.
- Bye.

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:10.578
There you go.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:15.042
Easy now. All right, take her easy there.

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:22.789
Well, my friend,
we had ourselves an adventure.

01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.791
How do I thank you, Mary?

01:24:24.893 --> 01:24:27.157
Well, you could start
by finding me a husband.

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:33.156
- I learned a lot from you.
- And I from you.

01:24:33.268 --> 01:24:35.702
I may bring 'em into the world...

01:24:35.804 --> 01:24:38.739
but you keep 'em alive and kicking
once they're here.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:42.469
Now, if you ever need a good midwife...

01:24:42.577 --> 01:24:44.477
you know where to find me.

01:24:44.579 --> 01:24:47.571
Oh.

01:24:58.593 --> 01:25:01.221
Oh, young man,
I'm gonna need a hand here.

01:25:01.329 --> 01:25:04.127
All right. Here we go.

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:07.099
- Wait a minute. One, two, three.
- Steady, steady, steady.

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:13.733
Well, commodore,
are we sailing with the tide?

01:25:13.842 --> 01:25:16.333
I thought you said we were burning daylight.

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:21.245
Yes, ma'am. Hyah! Giddyap! Get!

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:37.895
What were you and Mary
whispering to each other?

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:40.797
Oh, just telling her
I'd be needing a good midwife.

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:47.208
- You mean-
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:50.808
Are-Are you sure?

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:55.872
I'm a doctor. I know a pregnant woman
when I see one, especially when I am one.

01:25:55.984 --> 01:25:59.351
Hey.

01:26:00.288 --> 01:26:02.188
We're gonna have a baby.

01:26:02.290 --> 01:26:05.088
A baby?

01:26:05.193 --> 01:26:06.683
We're gonna have a baby.

01:26:08.963 --> 01:26:11.231
Lillian Owens, you're late enough
for school as it is.

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:12.592
Put those running legs to good use.

01:26:12.700 --> 01:26:15.828
Yes, Ma.

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:18.461
Joshua Coil,
don't just stand there and gawk.

01:26:18.462 --> 01:26:19.668
You've got a job to do.

01:26:19.774 --> 01:26:22.572
Yes, ma'am.

01:26:24.379 --> 01:26:26.827
I've got patients to attend to
and baby plans to make.

01:26:26.828 --> 01:26:27.644
Mm-hmm.

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:32.350
Uh, now wait up.

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:34.421
Wait up.

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:38.423
How far along are you?

01:26:38.526 --> 01:26:40.824
Now, I'm serious.

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:43.193
We've gotta start talking about names.

01:26:43.298 --> 01:26:46.392
- I like Lee for a boy.
- Oh, you think it's gonna be a boy?

01:26:46.501 --> 01:26:49.629
Or, you know, maybe Daphne for a girl.
What do you think?

01:26:49.737 --> 01:26:50.947
Oh, that's very pretty.

01:26:50.948 --> 01:26:52.763
Come on. You want a
little girl, don't you?

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:55.843
- And what do you think?
- Hold on. Let me get the door for you.

01:26:55.944 --> 01:26:58.378
- Oh, Lee, my goodness.
- Take it easy.

01:26:58.479 --> 01:27:00.447
- Stop it.
- There you go.
