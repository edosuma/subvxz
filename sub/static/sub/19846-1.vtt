00:37.219 --> 00:39.219
Based on the book by Jan Guillou

00:39.984 --> 00:43.984
Arn - The Knight Templar

00:50.802 --> 00:52.802
The Holy Land

00:56.368 --> 00:59.405
The war raged
between Christians and Muslims

00:59.568 --> 01:04.881
in a battle over the city
that was sacred to them all: Jerusalem.

01:05.048 --> 01:10.645
Assaults and robberies made it dangerous
to travel in the inhospitable country.

02:04.328 --> 02:07.735
In order to protect
travellers, the church...

02:07.835 --> 02:10.244
sent their most-feared warriors:

02:10.407 --> 02:12.205
The Knights Templar.

02:21.368 --> 02:26.317
For some, they were
God-blessed soldiers.

02:26.488 --> 02:32.165
For others they were
the devil and evil demons.

03:00.768 --> 03:03.760
It is him.

03:03.928 --> 03:07.079
- The devil with the Red Cross.
- "Al Ghouti."

03:12.608 --> 03:15.725
Why does he help us?

03:31.848 --> 03:33.918
Al Ghouti.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.038
Arn.

03:49.128 --> 03:51.323
Arn!

03:55.288 --> 04:01.841
Many years earlier, in the cold
Nordic countries, Arn Magnusson grew up.

04:02.008 --> 04:06.445
His fate would be decisive
for many peoples' life and death.

04:06.608 --> 04:08.599
Arn!

04:10.528 --> 04:13.759
Arn! Where are you?

04:15.568 --> 04:18.526
It is not fun anymore.

04:19.128 --> 04:22.484
Arn, come out now!

04:23.128 --> 04:25.562
Yes, you are dead!

04:45.168 --> 04:48.558
What are you doing out here alone? What?

04:50.208 --> 04:53.723
This is no place for small boys.

04:58.968 --> 05:03.200
Arn was born on the farm Arnäs in
West Götaland (Gothia) in South Sweden,

05:03.368 --> 05:08.044
a small kingdom where three powerful
dynasties competed for the crown.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.358
Arn?

05:11.528 --> 05:15.203
Arns parents,
who belonged to the Folkung dynasty,

05:15.368 --> 05:17.882
had long kept the peace
with their neighbors.

05:18.048 --> 05:20.084
Eskil!

05:21.248 --> 05:24.763
- Have you seen the boys?
- No, Sigrid, my wife.

05:35.048 --> 05:39.644
Get Mr Magnus! His brother is here.

05:44.328 --> 05:49.083
- I found them north of the creek.
- Are you completely out of your mind?

05:49.248 --> 05:53.958
What is it with you?
How many times do I have to tell you?

05:54.128 --> 05:58.679
- Never go alone into the forest. Never!
- No.

05:58.848 --> 06:01.408
In with you now!

06:01.568 --> 06:05.243
- Birger!
- Magnus!

06:06.648 --> 06:10.960
- What brings you here, brother?
- The King is on the way.

06:15.008 --> 06:19.081
King Erik Jevardsson tried
to strengthen their power

06:19.248 --> 06:23.002
against the most dangerous enemy:
the Sverkers ("Swedes").

06:23.168 --> 06:30.324
He had allowed construction of a church
that now would bear his name:

06:31.408 --> 06:36.607
I want to cement our long friendship
in the Church's sacred land.

06:36.768 --> 06:39.514
Do I have your support, Folkung-Clan?

06:39.614 --> 06:43.116
Or do I have to leave
your house as your enemy?

06:45.808 --> 06:48.800
Knut, get your jinx out of here!

06:50.088 --> 06:55.367
Choosing the right side was crucial:
Knut knew from his father

06:55.528 --> 07:00.158
that those who fought for the crown
could gain much,

07:00.328 --> 07:04.003
but they could also lose everything.

07:10.488 --> 07:17.360
- So you'll be king one day?
- Father says it's decided by God.

07:17.528 --> 07:23.603
He says that my son will be king,
and my grandson, and my grandson's son.

07:23.768 --> 07:29.161
And your great-great-
great-great-grandson.

07:32.088 --> 07:35.763
- Can I hold him?
- Mm.

07:37.328 --> 07:42.721
- Oops, sorry!
- He always comes back.

07:46.688 --> 07:53.924
Folkung supported the king Erik,
so that he could inaugurate the church.

07:54.088 --> 07:59.287
A "God's house" (church) -
but located on Sverker land.

08:52.688 --> 08:55.407
How dare you attack God's house?

08:56.328 --> 08:58.319
No!

09:14.768 --> 09:18.522
Listen to me, Folkungs!

09:19.288 --> 09:23.998
Now there is only one legitimate king
in West Götaland (Gothia),

09:24.168 --> 09:27.524
and it's me, Karl Sverkersson.

09:37.128 --> 09:39.278
Who is he?

09:41.688 --> 09:44.248
Is that his son?

09:46.208 --> 09:49.280
No, he is with me.

10:14.688 --> 10:19.921
Knut is not safe here. I say we send him
to his brothers in Norway.

10:27.768 --> 10:31.197
The sword was from the sheath, and...

10:31.297 --> 10:35.197
the people turned around
to God with fear.

10:35.368 --> 10:39.486
Because only God knew
what the future would bring

10:39.648 --> 10:43.960
and who would be friend or enemy.

10:44.128 --> 10:48.644
On Monday the Arnäs family prepared
for uncertain times,

10:48.808 --> 10:54.758
and Arn would soon get to know God's
intentions for him and his family.

11:05.528 --> 11:10.397
- Will there be war now?
- No, don't worry.

11:14.208 --> 11:18.167
We have a new king. That's all.

11:18.328 --> 11:21.126
So it is.

11:21.288 --> 11:24.280
Where is Knut?

11:27.648 --> 11:30.685
He is in Norway.

11:32.008 --> 11:34.515
But should Knut not be king?

11:34.615 --> 11:39.039
With God's help he will
claim the throne one day.

11:39.208 --> 11:45.807
- We have to be patient.
- No, Ingmar! Those go to the forge.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.846
Arn, come!

11:59.248 --> 12:03.366
- Look!
- It is Knut's bird.

12:16.208 --> 12:20.042
No, Arn! You should not go up there.

12:22.768 --> 12:26.397
Arn! Don't do that!

12:52.648 --> 12:54.479
Arn!

12:59.808 --> 13:01.719
Ouch!

13:04.088 --> 13:06.727
Mother! Mother!

13:07.808 --> 13:10.766
- Mother, come!
- Arn!

13:11.408 --> 13:13.239
Arn!

13:15.208 --> 13:17.438
Arn!

13:22.208 --> 13:26.167
- Arn, do you hear me?
- What happened?

13:26.328 --> 13:30.446
I told him he was not
allowed to go up there.

13:30.608 --> 13:32.997
Arn?

14:34.888 --> 14:38.403
We must not give up hope, Magnus.

14:47.848 --> 14:49.679
Come!

15:00.768 --> 15:06.286
Good God, make Arn healthy again.

15:08.008 --> 15:13.207
If you let him live,
we promise to repay you.

15:23.288 --> 15:28.999
We promise to let him do
your sacred work.

15:32.848 --> 15:36.124
He will be your servant on earth.

15:38.768 --> 15:42.647
God, we give you our promise.

15:46.248 --> 15:49.923
God, we give you our promise.

15:54.688 --> 15:57.680
We give you our promise.

16:02.808 --> 16:07.438
Panem nostrum quotidianum
da nobis hodie...

17:01.168 --> 17:03.887
Magnus...

17:06.968 --> 17:09.435
Our prayer has been answered.

18:14.928 --> 18:20.525
- Listen now, I've decided.
- You can't be serious.

18:20.688 --> 18:23.680
He is just a child.

18:24.248 --> 18:28.161
We promised, Magnus.

18:28.328 --> 18:33.880
No, Sigrid, I will not send
my boy to the monastery.

18:34.048 --> 18:37.677
Do you think I want to do it?

18:37.848 --> 18:42.558
I can no longer turn a blind eye
for my sin.

18:42.728 --> 18:48.280
- He is just a child.
- We promised, Magnus.

18:49.608 --> 18:56.002
If God let Arn live, we would
give him to his holy church.

18:59.048 --> 19:04.281
God has a task for Arn.

19:04.448 --> 19:07.440
For something so large
we should not stand in the way.

19:14.368 --> 19:20.000
It is God's punishment, Magnus.
We have betrayed him.

19:22.208 --> 19:25.996
This is how he reminds us.

19:42.328 --> 19:46.241
We must meet our promise.

19:49.448 --> 19:53.043
I take him to Varnhem monastery.

20:36.448 --> 20:39.360
- Father Henri.
- My children.

20:39.528 --> 20:42.565
Father, I need your help.

20:42.728 --> 20:45.481
What is it, my child?

20:59.568 --> 21:02.924
We have an extra
blanket if it gets cold.

21:03.808 --> 21:06.163
Where is mother?

21:06.328 --> 21:09.604
We will do what we can for her.

21:37.608 --> 21:39.519
The boy...

21:40.528 --> 21:42.459
Brother Lucien has examined the mother.

21:42.559 --> 21:45.556
The sores on her face are
quite consistent with swine fever.

21:45.728 --> 21:49.960
That we can cure.
Her arm...

21:50.128 --> 21:54.041
It is blood poisoning.
There's only one cure for that.

21:54.208 --> 21:57.245
It has to be removed?

21:58.608 --> 22:01.645
The mother refuses.

22:01.808 --> 22:04.766
She says it is the will of God.

22:09.848 --> 22:13.267
She and her husband
promised the child to God.

22:13.367 --> 22:15.957
Thus the promise is a sacred trust.

22:16.128 --> 22:19.404
We cannot oppose the will of God.

22:19.568 --> 22:24.198
But I'm reluctant to raise a child
to become a monk.

22:27.048 --> 22:31.564
To become one of us
must be a free choice.

22:46.568 --> 22:51.722
Father Henri has promised
that you are allowed to stay here.

22:54.928 --> 22:59.126
It is God's will, Arn.
Do you understand?

23:00.288 --> 23:03.917
Will you stay here as well, mother?

23:12.168 --> 23:16.525
Be obedient and do as you are told.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.885
Promise me that.

23:23.048 --> 23:25.482
Do you promise?

24:16.968 --> 24:20.324
You want to try? Good.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.596
Want to try?

24:34.848 --> 24:37.442
How are you? There, take it.

24:38.728 --> 24:40.684
Hold it tight.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.200
And now... Aim.

24:47.968 --> 24:50.482
And now try to hit the target.

24:57.968 --> 24:59.924
Very good!

25:01.088 --> 25:03.921
Good. Again.

25:04.088 --> 25:05.806
Very good!

25:05.968 --> 25:08.243
Look!

25:08.408 --> 25:10.524
I told you, always look in my eye.

25:10.688 --> 25:14.920
- Voce.
- Voce.

25:15.088 --> 25:18.603
Vocamus... scribo...

25:19.848 --> 25:23.204
- Scribis.
- Scribis.

25:24.008 --> 25:26.886
- Voco.
- Voce.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.802
- Voco.
- Voce.

25:47.168 --> 25:49.045
Arn!

25:50.688 --> 25:55.204
Arn! Arn, wake up!

25:55.368 --> 25:57.199
Come!

27:27.768 --> 27:32.922
"Thou hast ravished my heart,
my sister, my spouse;

27:33.088 --> 27:37.366
"thou hast ravished my heart
with one of thine eyes,

27:37.528 --> 27:43.319
"with one chain of thy neck."

27:43.488 --> 27:46.635
The song of Solomon is
the most beautiful text...

27:46.735 --> 27:49.165
about love that has ever been written.

27:49.928 --> 27:53.477
But how can you "ravish"
(take) someone's heart?

27:53.648 --> 27:58.085
It is meant figuratively, Arn.

28:06.168 --> 28:11.481
"Legere est omnis
scientiae fundamentum."

28:11.648 --> 28:14.560
Now write it.

28:14.728 --> 28:18.687
Reading is the foundation
of all knowledge.

28:29.288 --> 28:30.641
What?

28:37.888 --> 28:41.597
In which hand does
it feel most comfortable?

28:46.808 --> 28:48.400
Both.

28:49.848 --> 28:52.123
Again.

28:52.288 --> 28:54.563
Bien.

28:57.768 --> 28:59.963
Regarde!

29:06.368 --> 29:09.724
You seem to be training
him to be a warrior.

29:11.968 --> 29:14.926
Is that entirely wise?

29:15.088 --> 29:17.324
I am merely strengthening	...

29:17.424 --> 29:20.685
the skills that God
has already given him.

29:30.048 --> 29:33.085
You have a new friend. Look!

29:33.248 --> 29:35.842
What a beautiful horse!

29:40.968 --> 29:44.961
- What kind of horse is that?
- Well...

29:45.128 --> 29:50.725
He belongs to the noblest, the fastest
and the most resilient breed there is.

29:50.888 --> 29:55.006
- They are war horses.
- Where is he from?

29:58.248 --> 29:59.761
The Holy Land.

30:19.888 --> 30:24.962
- Can you speak to him?
- I can speak to desert horses.

30:30.928 --> 30:33.317
I think he likes you.

30:33.488 --> 30:36.719
Tell him that I like him, too.

30:36.888 --> 30:39.607
What's his name?

30:39.768 --> 30:41.440
Chamsiin.

30:41.608 --> 30:43.803
Cham... siin.

30:44.048 --> 30:47.518
It means "Desert Wind."

30:47.688 --> 30:50.566
Do you want to ride him?

30:57.768 --> 31:01.602
Good! Can you feel
the strength of the horse?

31:05.568 --> 31:07.365
Good!

32:08.568 --> 32:13.198
- Help me! I do not want to!
- There she is!

32:13.368 --> 32:17.839
- I beg you, help me!
- Come on, Gunnar, come!

32:18.008 --> 32:22.206
- Sinner!
- Where is she?! She's my bride.

32:27.168 --> 32:30.160
- No, let me!
- Let's do justice.

32:36.088 --> 32:40.684
- You wanted to take my bride?
- He is innocent!

32:40.848 --> 32:45.763
Just as innocent as you are!
You want to prevent my wedding?

32:47.608 --> 32:50.884
Do what you have to, brother.

32:51.048 --> 32:55.564
Calm down!
He is only a young monk.

33:04.848 --> 33:08.204
Take it, boy! Pick it up!

33:12.808 --> 33:15.561
Pick it up!

33:24.048 --> 33:26.562
Take it, now!

33:33.848 --> 33:36.681
Do it, Gunnar!

34:13.648 --> 34:18.119
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

34:20.328 --> 34:23.877
I have committed the gravest of sins.

34:28.328 --> 34:31.161
I have killed two men.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.844
That is the end of your
confession, my son?

34:38.848 --> 34:42.578
All thy sins I thee forgive.
Ego te absolvo.

34:42.748 --> 34:45.764
In the name of the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

34:47.967 --> 34:50.482
I do not understand.

34:50.648 --> 34:52.445
Sit.

34:57.007 --> 35:00.557
You killed those men in self-defense.
They were sinners,

35:00.728 --> 35:03.401
trying to force that poor girl
to marry against her will.

35:03.568 --> 35:09.200
It might not have been a miracle
as that simple-minded priest said,

35:09.368 --> 35:13.839
but who if not God was it
that put them in your way?

35:20.168 --> 35:21.647
Arn...

35:21.808 --> 35:23.764
It was your mother's will, and God's,

35:23.864 --> 35:26.199
that you'd be raised
here in this monastery.

35:26.368 --> 35:29.440
Well, and now that you're grown up,
and must do the Lord's calling.

35:29.608 --> 35:33.237
Brother Guilbert and I
have discussed this.

35:33.408 --> 35:36.002
And we have reached a decision.

35:38.488 --> 35:41.719
The time has come for
you to go home, Arn.

35:41.888 --> 35:45.483
You must go back to your family.

35:50.448 --> 35:53.326
"In this sign thou shall conquer."

35:57.408 --> 36:01.640
Before I came here
to this peaceful monastery...

36:01.808 --> 36:04.959
...I served another order:

36:05.128 --> 36:07.517
God's holy army.

36:07.688 --> 36:09.519
The Knights Templar.

36:12.328 --> 36:17.243
For twelve years I fought
with this sword in the Holy Land.

36:19.128 --> 36:22.677
With this sword,
no one has ever defeated me.

36:26.848 --> 36:30.557
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.

36:31.928 --> 36:35.477
It has to serve God's good cause.

37:03.448 --> 37:07.885
Ave Maria...

37:56.648 --> 37:58.843
Cecilia!

37:59.008 --> 38:03.684
- Gra--
- Gracias...

38:25.568 --> 38:29.800
You have let your animals
graze on my land.

38:29.968 --> 38:34.564
- They must graze there.
- It is not your land.

38:34.728 --> 38:41.679
- You lie to me, straight in the face?
- The land has always belonged to us.

38:42.808 --> 38:48.326
- I am willing to swear an oath on that.
- We will see what you have to say.

38:54.168 --> 38:56.921
See you, liar!

38:58.528 --> 39:01.361
And who are you?

39:07.728 --> 39:09.559
Eskil!

39:11.688 --> 39:13.599
Father.

39:18.768 --> 39:21.566
Arn?

39:21.728 --> 39:24.242
It's you...

39:30.808 --> 39:33.641
I didn't recognize you.

39:50.248 --> 39:54.958
I thought we had lost you
to the monks.

39:56.608 --> 40:00.044
I'm happy to have you back.

40:05.888 --> 40:09.767
"When you pick bullshit instead",
she says no!

40:11.368 --> 40:15.122
Arn, my boy! Stand up!

40:16.848 --> 40:20.841
You are a Folkung now.
Wear it with pride.

40:25.368 --> 40:29.122
Father, who was the man who was here?

40:30.888 --> 40:32.476
- Emund Ulvbane.

40:32.576 --> 40:36.520
He is the bastard who killed King Erik.

40:39.168 --> 40:43.400
Now he says that we have taken his land.

40:43.568 --> 40:45.524
We'll present this dispute
at the Ting meeting.

40:45.928 --> 40:48.283
The Ting in Axevalla.

40:49.488 --> 40:52.605
Quite a lot of things have changed.

41:28.448 --> 41:31.963
Magnus! Eskil!

41:33.328 --> 41:38.163
And Arn! I am pleased
that you are back on Arnäs.

41:41.048 --> 41:42.832
- Likewise glad to see you.

41:42.932 --> 41:45.803
You've been a few years
in monastery cells.

41:45.968 --> 41:50.041
Have you learned how to read?

41:50.208 --> 41:55.362
- So you can really read now.
- Is Knut here?

41:55.528 --> 41:58.197
No, he is staying in Norway. When the...

41:58.298 --> 42:01.239
time is right, he'll
come back, but not yet.

42:01.408 --> 42:04.938
We have to give Ulvbane
silver, although we have...

42:05.038 --> 42:08.007
the right on our side.
We need to buy time.

42:09.008 --> 42:11.478
I intend to propose a settlement.

42:11.578 --> 42:15.880
It worries me that Ulvbane
and the Swerkers are so close.

42:16.048 --> 42:20.246
A concerned King is an
unpredictable king.

42:43.048 --> 42:48.680
We have gathered here in Axevall
to keep local governments.

42:48.848 --> 42:53.160
We come in peace and we go in peace.

42:53.688 --> 42:56.581
Anyone who violates the
peace of the Ting...

42:56.681 --> 42:58.637
will be regarded as an outlaw.

42:58.808 --> 43:02.721
Here and now this Ting is opened.

43:10.408 --> 43:14.633
The next question concerns the dispute...

43:14.733 --> 43:19.166
between Magnus Folkesson
and Emund Ulvbane.

43:19.328 --> 43:23.039
Magnus Folkesson is willing
to make an offer.

43:23.208 --> 43:30.717
It is true. I am willing to pay
Emund Ulvbane 30 silver coins.

43:33.008 --> 43:36.159
It is more than what it's worth,

43:36.328 --> 43:41.277
for peace between neighbours
is worth more than silver.

43:51.808 --> 43:54.561
The settlement is adequate.

44:00.648 --> 44:06.280
As the Ting has decided
I have to be content with that.

44:15.128 --> 44:20.202
But it is hard that silver is
more valuable than honour and justice.

44:20.368 --> 44:25.123
It is hard to reconcile
with a man without honour.

44:25.288 --> 44:30.681
You, Magnus Folkesson,
you're not a man.

44:32.648 --> 44:39.679
And your sons are not better:
One is a nun, the second a beer barrel.

44:47.368 --> 44:49.706
That was planned by Sverkersson.

44:49.806 --> 44:52.965
The words were planted
into Ulvbanes mouth.

44:53.128 --> 44:57.599
He knew exactly what to say!
Sverkersson wants to weaken us.

44:57.768 --> 45:01.647
He knows that Knut can come back
and that he could be the next king.

45:01.808 --> 45:04.720
I wish that there was a loophole.

45:04.888 --> 45:10.087
This insult can only be settled in
an ordeal by battle.

45:10.248 --> 45:13.320
Is there any other way?

45:18.048 --> 45:23.680
- There must be another way?
- I will meet him tomorrow.

45:23.848 --> 45:25.839
May God be with me!

46:03.928 --> 46:06.522
Don't worry about me!

46:08.368 --> 46:11.166
I am not dead yet.

46:23.728 --> 46:27.801
Let the combattants step forward!

46:34.688 --> 46:35.688
- Arn!

46:35.788 --> 46:39.239
Too late. He has taken up the challenge.

46:51.928 --> 46:55.603
Do I really have to fight against a nun?

47:03.248 --> 47:07.287
I didn't think
that your father was a coward.

48:34.768 --> 48:38.317
- Death to Swerker!
- Kill him, Arn!

48:38.488 --> 48:41.207
Kill! Kill!

50:18.528 --> 50:19.643
Welcome, Magnus!

50:19.743 --> 50:23.044
Your fame from Axevall
has arrived before you.

50:23.208 --> 50:25.783
- Algot, thank you
that we may rest here.

50:25.883 --> 50:26.883
Eskil!

50:28.488 --> 50:33.516
- There we have a new face.
- It is Arn.

50:33.688 --> 50:39.524
Last I saw you you where a toddler.
Now everybody's talking about you.

50:39.688 --> 50:42.521
You must be a proud father, Magnus.

52:30.968 --> 52:34.677
- You think I'm ugly.
- No.

53:05.648 --> 53:09.561
- Send my greetings to mother.
- Do not be sad, Katarina.

53:10.848 --> 53:14.602
Soon it is my turn again.

53:40.768 --> 53:42.649
Welcome home, Cecilia!

53:42.749 --> 53:46.400
Katarina was so sad
when she had to leave last time.

53:46.568 --> 53:51.403
It's always like that
when it is her turn to be here.

53:51.568 --> 53:55.846
- I promised that I would visit her.
- Cecilia, did you?

54:49.048 --> 54:51.357
Hello...

54:52.088 --> 54:55.797
- Cecilia.
- Yes, mother.

55:28.168 --> 55:33.037
Arn, Algot Pålsson is here.
He has his daughter with him.

55:37.528 --> 55:42.397
It is not Katarina.
It is, of course, Cecilia.

55:43.488 --> 55:47.083
Welcome, Algot! What brings you here?

55:47.248 --> 55:50.877
We were in the neighborhood, so...

55:54.728 --> 55:58.960
I just wanted to see how it looks.

55:59.128 --> 56:02.086
It has been a long
time since I was here.

56:14.848 --> 56:20.525
Father does not like it when I ride out
alone. That's why he's with us.

56:21.288 --> 56:27.443
You met my sister.
Katarina... well, you met her?

56:30.008 --> 56:33.239
- Yes, I did.
- What do you think of her?

56:33.408 --> 56:36.684
You are not alike.

56:36.848 --> 56:40.841
- You are quite different.
- What do you mean?

56:44.328 --> 56:47.638
What a beautiful horse you have!

56:50.368 --> 56:52.518
Come!

56:56.328 --> 56:59.365
Come and catch me if you can!

57:34.808 --> 57:39.643
- We almost got rid of him.
- Miss Cecilia!

57:39.808 --> 57:45.440
- Miss Cecilia!
- Meet me here at dawn.

58:06.208 --> 58:07.926
Cecilia!

58:12.288 --> 58:14.597
Cecilia!

58:22.048 --> 58:23.959
Cecilia!

59:01.288 --> 59:03.006
Arn?

59:05.928 --> 59:07.327
Arn?

59:12.768 --> 59:15.441
Stop!

59:28.568 --> 59:31.287
You have--

59:31.448 --> 59:33.325
What did you say?

59:34.768 --> 59:37.680
What did you say?

59:39.688 --> 59:45.160
"You have taken my heart,
my sister, my bride;

59:48.928 --> 59:53.160
"You have taken my heart
with a single glance."

01:00:01.728 --> 01:00:06.643
I think that you have taken mine,
Arn Magnusson.

01:00:58.168 --> 01:01:01.399
How are you?

01:01:03.688 --> 01:01:06.122
I am fine, how are you?

01:01:06.288 --> 01:01:10.327
It was my fault
that you ended up in that monastery.

01:01:13.259 --> 01:01:14.612
Knut?

01:01:23.939 --> 01:01:29.139
- I thought you were in Norway.
- Yeah, it's me.

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:39.736
It is good to see you again, Arn.

01:01:40.459 --> 01:01:45.295
This is Arn, the hero of Axevall.

01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:49.414
Was it with this sword that...?

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:55.408
Let me have a look.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.745
Let all the saints ensure...

01:02:06.845 --> 01:02:09.688
that we are always on
the same side, Arn.

01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:17.016
- Are you coming to Arnäs?
- Not this time.

01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:20.012
I have a mission to accomplish.

01:02:21.179 --> 01:02:24.172
But I'll see you soon again,
I promise.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.730
Brothers!

01:02:58.219 --> 01:03:02.258
- What happened?
- Knut has returned.

01:03:02.420 --> 01:03:05.412
He has killed Emund Ulvbane.

01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:09.697
I've heard that you're
after Algot Pålsson's youngest daughter.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:18.852
Stay away away from her
or people will start talking.

01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:22.973
Everyone knows that you and Knut
are best friends.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:30.416
I have to get hold of him before he
gets up to more devilry.

01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:37.935
Algot can not give his daughter
to one of the king's enemies.

01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:58.090
I do not want some Swerker guy.
I want to be yours, Arn.

01:04:44.660 --> 01:04:48.778
The Holy Virgin is on our side.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:55.653
Nothing can divide us.

01:05:05.219 --> 01:05:08.689
Arn, you can't do that. Forget it.

01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:17.616
Cecilia can never be yours as long
as Karl of Sweden is in power.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.652
Knut?

01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:03.768
- They are looking everywhere for you.
- I'm going to Visingsö soon.

01:06:03.939 --> 01:06:06.658
To the king's castle?

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:10.049
I will take back what is mine.

01:06:10.820 --> 01:06:12.571
Knut...

01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:20.497
I can understand if you
don't want to get involved, but...

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:23.731
...I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:29.213
Cecilia Algots-daughter.
She is promised to someone else.

01:06:30.179 --> 01:06:33.012
I will be king.

01:06:33.179 --> 01:06:38.333
If I can count on your support,
you can count on me.

01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:53.892
- How do you know that he will come?
- He will, I am sure.

01:07:54.060 --> 01:07:55.891
He will.

01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:30.671
Tell your people that now Knut

01:09:30.770 --> 01:09:34.495
Eriksson is king of
Western Götaland (Gothia).

01:10:27.180 --> 01:10:29.818
Cecilia!

01:10:29.979 --> 01:10:35.100
- Where's mother?
- I wanted to talk to you alone.

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:44.771
I have something to tell you.

01:10:47.459 --> 01:10:50.930
I am betrothed to Arn Magnusson.

01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:00.012
- What's wrong?
- I knew it.

01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:02.693
What?

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:07.728
Father cannot afford two weddings.

01:11:07.899 --> 01:11:14.896
- I will never get away from here.
- Don't say that! I will not leave you.

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.656
It will work out in the end.
Arn is a friend of Knut.

01:11:19.819 --> 01:11:24.131
When he becomes king,
everything will be different.

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:27.531
Sorry, Cecilia.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:32.410
I am glad for your sake.
When will the wedding be?

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.528
It is not decided,
but it must be soon.

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:43.218
You're the only one I can tell this.
Promise not to tell anybody.

01:11:46.620 --> 01:11:48.975
I bear his child.

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:05.569
- Are you quite sure about that?
- Yes.

01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:15.855
And this Arn Magnusson
would be Knut Eriksson's best friend?

01:12:16.019 --> 01:12:18.897
Yes, Mother Rikissa.

01:12:27.300 --> 01:12:30.609
One more thing...

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:37.378
Before Arn met Cecilia,
he had sex with me.

01:12:48.859 --> 01:12:54.729
You do well understand that
this will not stop here?

01:13:13.140 --> 01:13:16.127
Have you lost your mind?
Killing the king...

01:13:16.227 --> 01:13:19.214
before we know what kind
of support we have!

01:13:19.379 --> 01:13:23.931
Knut is a hothead, but you...
Why?

01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:26.931
- You should keep him
under control (arrest?).

01:13:27.031 --> 01:13:29.173
Do you not want Knut on the throne?

01:13:29.339 --> 01:13:32.649
But he is not ready yet!

01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:41.690
In order to survive it is not enough
to kill anyone who stands in your way.

01:13:41.859 --> 01:13:46.569
You have to think as he
and his brother is thinking!

01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:50.291
He has the Erik-clan and
the Folkung-clan behind him.

01:13:50.459 --> 01:13:53.212
But the Sverkers (Swedes)
still hold Visingsö.

01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.334
They have the church behind them.

01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.012
You have not yet killed the snake.

01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:11.585
Honourable bishop,

01:14:11.685 --> 01:14:16.372
it is with a heavy heart
I write these lines,

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:20.381
when the sorrow of our
beloved king's death...

01:14:20.481 --> 01:14:23.139
still weighs down our monastery.

01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:26.041
But in these anxious times all

01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:30.092
Swerkers need to be
faithful to each other.

01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:34.172
This is why I have to write.

01:14:34.339 --> 01:14:37.784
I have knowledge and written proof...

01:14:37.884 --> 01:14:42.179
which is of great importance
for our brothers.

01:14:42.339 --> 01:14:47.892
This is about the
king's murderer's Knut best friend:

01:14:48.060 --> 01:14:51.210
Arn Magnusson of the Folkungs.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:15:00.649
Here in Skara is a young man

01:15:00.819 --> 01:15:03.288
whose face is angelic

01:15:03.459 --> 01:15:08.817
but whose heart is
black and full of sin.

01:15:08.979 --> 01:15:14.134
With fine words and false promises
he has seduced a young maiden

01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:17.257
into having sinful sexual intercourse.

01:15:20.379 --> 01:15:26.978
Good Lord, he impregnated
her without being married.

01:15:33.339 --> 01:15:35.728
But this is not the worst.

01:15:35.979 --> 01:15:41.815
The young man had already
have an atrocity on his conscience.

01:15:41.979 --> 01:15:44.096
He had already been...

01:15:44.196 --> 01:15:48.579
in bed with the younger
sister of the maiden.

01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:52.167
To take two sisters of
the same father is...

01:15:52.267 --> 01:15:56.010
against christian law and
the work of the devil.

01:15:59.499 --> 01:16:03.698
There is no excuse for this.

01:16:10.899 --> 01:16:18.614
Arn Magnusson of Arnäs farm and
Cecilia Algotsdotter from Pålsgården

01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:25.213
are excommunicated from this day on.

01:16:26.379 --> 01:16:32.773
None of the churches in West Götaland
(Gothia) may deal with them.

01:16:34.339 --> 01:16:37.571
They are condemned to
discipline and penance

01:16:39.580 --> 01:16:45.814
in Varnhems and Gudhems monasteries

01:16:47.419 --> 01:16:52.254
for half their lives - 20 years.

01:18:01.780 --> 01:18:03.690
- Cecilia!
- Arn!

01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:10.852
Cecilia...

01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:22.055
Whatever they say,
I have never been with your sister.

01:18:26.339 --> 01:18:28.978
I have never loved anyone else.

01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:38.052
I swear
that I will get you out of here.

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:44.374
We have to pray to the Holy Virgin.
She will hear our prayers.

01:18:44.859 --> 01:18:50.492
Don't take any monasterial vows,
because they are irrevocable.

01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:55.697
I'll wait for you.

01:19:00.379 --> 01:19:02.575
Cecilia!

01:19:10.859 --> 01:19:13.498
Cecilia Algotsdotter!

01:19:16.539 --> 01:19:19.292
No, I do not want to!

01:19:19.459 --> 01:19:21.211
No!

01:19:52.379 --> 01:19:54.018
Take it.

01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:00.056
Refusing to eat doesn't help.

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:18.255
- Have you ever had doubts, Guilbert?
- About eating? No, never.

01:20:19.859 --> 01:20:23.693
Doubting is one way in
which God tries us.

01:20:29.660 --> 01:20:32.731
When I killed two men I walked free.

01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.929
But for love I am punished?
How can that be the will of God?

01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:44.212
What you're speaking of
has nothing to do with God.

01:20:44.379 --> 01:20:47.929
These are the plots and schemes of men.

01:20:50.859 --> 01:20:53.055
Ora et labora.

01:20:53.620 --> 01:20:59.854
Prayer and work, Cecilia.
That's what you have ahead of you.

01:21:00.019 --> 01:21:05.332
If you think that your life here
will be just as comfortable as it was,

01:21:05.499 --> 01:21:09.378
you are badly mistaken.

01:21:09.539 --> 01:21:16.412
You are now among Swerkers
and to be chastised and do penance.

01:21:17.979 --> 01:21:20.812
Look at me!

01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:27.530
Look at me!

01:21:46.339 --> 01:21:51.175
I will eventually subdue you,
Cecilia Algotsdotter.

01:22:13.019 --> 01:22:16.012
Folkung whore!

01:23:22.425 --> 01:23:25.101
'Many are called, but few are chosen.'

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740
Guilty or not,

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.619
you have been convicted
of an abomination.

01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:35.011
No man can lift that sentence.

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.818
But you will not stay here at Varnhem.

01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:40.777
I have written to the bishop,

01:23:40.939 --> 01:23:44.818
and he has agreed to our request.

01:23:46.700 --> 01:23:51.853
Under the name of "Arn de Gothia"
you will journey first to Rome

01:23:52.019 --> 01:23:55.898
and from there to the Holy Land.

01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.655
- Father, I...
- You will be a Knight Templar, Arn.

01:24:03.819 --> 01:24:06.573
A soldier in the service of God.

01:24:23.499 --> 01:24:25.774
Take good care of Chamsiin.

01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:06.016
You sit here daydreaming again?

01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:10.571
Do you still think that your lover
will come to pick you up?

01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:17.736
He will not. Arn Magnusson has
been sent to the war in the Holy Land.

01:25:22.539 --> 01:25:26.852
- No, you are lying!
- You will never see him again.

01:26:21.539 --> 01:26:23.018
Sir?

01:26:25.339 --> 01:26:26.852
Sir.

01:26:28.339 --> 01:26:29.852
Sir...

01:26:31.060 --> 01:26:33.699
We should be heading back now.

01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.768
You saved our lives, Knight Templar.

01:27:26.019 --> 01:27:27.931
You speak our language.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:32.775
Then you will understand that I do not
wish to be indebted to a Christian.

01:27:33.939 --> 01:27:36.534
- Allow me to repay you.
- You are very generous,

01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:41.090
but as a Knight Templar
I can not accept your money.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.090
Farewell.

01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:47.249
Allez! (Go!)

01:27:51.419 --> 01:27:53.411
Then at least share
a meal with us.

01:27:56.060 --> 01:27:57.811
At our camp.

01:27:59.859 --> 01:28:01.851
Sir?

01:28:02.939 --> 01:28:08.377
I swear by Allah and his prophet,
we mean you no harm.

01:28:08.539 --> 01:28:10.814
If you give us the same assurance.

01:28:12.819 --> 01:28:15.050
You have my word.

01:28:21.979 --> 01:28:24.494
God truly moves in mysterious ways.

01:28:27.459 --> 01:28:31.691
Only he knows why he sent
an enemy to our rescue.

01:28:31.859 --> 01:28:34.692
You could have killed us
as easily as you killed the bandits.

01:28:34.859 --> 01:28:37.331
Those bandits have robbed many pilgrims,

01:28:37.431 --> 01:28:40.218
and it's our mission to
protect the pilgrims.

01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:45.689
"Take no one else's life."

01:28:46.740 --> 01:28:50.254
"Because each life is
sacred in God's eyes."

01:28:50.419 --> 01:28:54.207
"Only for a righteous cause."

01:28:54.379 --> 01:28:59.329
- You are familiar with the Holy Koran.
- I have been here many years.

01:29:03.419 --> 01:29:05.809
Al Ghouti...

01:29:05.979 --> 01:29:09.289
I have heard of you.
You are a great warrior.

01:29:09.459 --> 01:29:12.452
I am Youssouf. This is my brother Fahkr.

01:29:14.379 --> 01:29:17.769
We are merchants on our way to Cairo.

01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:23.895
Taking this way around the
Dead Sea without an escort?

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:30.017
- It is the shortest route.
- But not the safest.

01:29:33.459 --> 01:29:38.772
We have sworn not to raise arms
against each other.

01:29:38.959 --> 01:29:42.974
So let us be honest.
You are warriors, just like us.

01:29:51.459 --> 01:29:52.974
Leave us alone.

01:30:04.419 --> 01:30:07.139
I'll go and see to the horses.

01:30:19.859 --> 01:30:24.092
- Do you know who I am?
- You are Youssouf Sala ad-Din Ayyoubi.

01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:26.295
The one we know as Saladin.

01:30:26.459 --> 01:30:29.930
- And you're not afraid?
- You have given me your word.

01:30:35.859 --> 01:30:39.898
You are a man of honor.
Not like your brothers.

01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:50.210
It is a shame that
you must lose this war.

01:30:50.379 --> 01:30:53.497
- I have sworn to win.
- So have I.

01:30:53.660 --> 01:30:58.370
And we shall soon see
which one of us is right.

01:30:59.700 --> 01:31:01.656
Very soon.

01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:09.369
- De Gothia.
- Sir.

01:32:09.539 --> 01:32:13.199
Back so soon? I trust you
have completed your mission.

01:32:13.299 --> 01:32:14.719
I have, grand master.

01:32:15.419 --> 01:32:19.015
- But I have bad news to report.
- Go on.

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.537
- Saladin is here.
- What?

01:32:20.780 --> 01:32:22.563
He could march
on Jerusalem at any time.

01:32:22.663 --> 01:32:23.600
This is not possible.

01:32:23.700 --> 01:32:26.691
Saladins forces are
scattered across the country.

01:32:26.859 --> 01:32:31.012
Surely, we would have heard something
if he had assembled an army.

01:32:31.180 --> 01:32:34.809
Saladin is here,
and he is sure of his victory.

01:32:34.979 --> 01:32:37.319
I have just spoken to
the King of Jerusalem.

01:32:37.419 --> 01:32:39.814
His spies report that
Saladin is in Damascus.

01:32:39.979 --> 01:32:42.619
Not anymore.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:45.449
Grand Master, I don't
know what de Gothia...

01:32:45.549 --> 01:32:48.218
hopes to achieve by
spreading these rumours.

01:32:48.379 --> 01:32:51.850
- Who told you this, de Gothia?
- An eye-witness.

01:32:52.019 --> 01:32:54.169
Who told you?

01:32:56.740 --> 01:32:59.173
A man I trust.

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:04.414
Gentlemen...

01:33:10.499 --> 01:33:11.941
Now I understand...

01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:15.369
why you didn't want to
reveal your sources.

01:33:15.539 --> 01:33:17.573
But you kept your word
as Knight Templar,

01:33:17.673 --> 01:33:19.453
and that's of the utmost importance.

01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:21.735
Now, what did you learn?

01:33:21.899 --> 01:33:25.973
He was heading south.
That's where the attack will come from.

01:33:28.019 --> 01:33:32.649
I will inform the king.
We must prepare for a siege.

01:33:32.819 --> 01:33:37.335
Tell me, de Gothia...
What kind of man is he, our enemy?

01:33:39.780 --> 01:33:42.977
He is like us. A man of his word.

01:33:46.859 --> 01:33:51.774
I am glad that God has given me
this chance to get to know my enemy.

01:33:53.019 --> 01:33:55.817
You respect him.

01:33:56.979 --> 01:33:59.177
You must know your enemy to defeat him.

01:34:06.939 --> 01:34:10.090
And you are a most worthy opponent.

01:34:12.180 --> 01:34:16.139
I have sworn my oath
as a Knight Templar,

01:34:16.300 --> 01:34:20.895
but I have also sworn
to return home when my time here is due.

01:34:21.939 --> 01:34:25.057
Perhaps there is
someone waiting for you?

01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:08.412
Mother Rikissa has forbidden
to open the prison cell.

01:35:27.459 --> 01:35:33.728
- How long has she been here?
- Several days and several nights.

01:35:34.819 --> 01:35:37.333
Help her up, and get her out of here.

01:35:49.180 --> 01:35:55.494
- What is this?
- We have orders to punish her often.

01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:06.618
I'm not chiding you.
I come with reconciliation.

01:36:06.780 --> 01:36:10.294
Cecilia! Cecilia!

01:36:10.459 --> 01:36:16.808
No one is allowed to talk to her,
and now she does not speak with anyone.

01:36:17.939 --> 01:36:24.175
You can talk to me, Cecilia.
There is no need to be defiant.

01:36:24.539 --> 01:36:29.011
You have to reconcile
yourself with your fate.

01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:33.492
Mother Rikissa only wants your best.

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.769
This child is a child of sin.

01:37:09.899 --> 01:37:13.575
Give me my child! Give me my child!

01:37:14.939 --> 01:37:17.659
No!

01:37:29.019 --> 01:37:32.648
It's for her own good.

01:37:32.819 --> 01:37:36.858
You've been leeching her?
She was white as a sheet.

01:37:37.019 --> 01:37:41.969
Your Eminence know how effective
it is against the carnal desires.

01:37:42.140 --> 01:37:45.450
She has been stubborn
from the beginning.

01:37:45.620 --> 01:37:49.056
You should not treat her so hard.

01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:54.373
All the years of war
have weakened our dynasty position.

01:37:54.539 --> 01:37:57.715
We do not know how long we
can hold our position...

01:37:57.815 --> 01:38:00.296
against Knut Eriksson and his followers.

01:38:00.459 --> 01:38:05.772
- Those damned blue coats!
- Now you listen to me, Rikissa!

01:38:05.939 --> 01:38:11.775
If they are victorious, God forbid,
it would hardly benefit the monastery

01:38:11.939 --> 01:38:16.411
if Cecilia Algotsdotter
has been harmed.

01:40:06.419 --> 01:40:08.250
Cecilia...

01:40:13.220 --> 01:40:15.653
You're not alone any more.

01:40:40.419 --> 01:40:43.252
It has come to my attention

01:40:43.419 --> 01:40:48.414
that Cecilia deserves a punishment.

01:40:48.580 --> 01:40:52.095
She has violated the talking rules.

01:40:52.260 --> 01:40:57.539
Not you, Cecilia Algotsdotter.
We have a new Cecilia among us.

01:40:57.700 --> 01:41:00.851
Cecilia Blanka, come here!

01:41:05.939 --> 01:41:12.048
This new Cecilia shall
be called Blanka from now on.

01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:15.369
On the first evening she spoke...

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:19.490
with Cecilia Algotsdotter
against the ban.

01:41:19.660 --> 01:41:22.048
Go!

01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:33.134
Helena!

01:41:33.300 --> 01:41:35.655
Come here!

01:41:43.819 --> 01:41:50.167
Three whippings, in the name of the
Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:43:19.379 --> 01:43:22.132
Who are you?

01:43:23.620 --> 01:43:29.251
I am the future Queen.
I am betrothed to Knut Eriksson.

01:43:29.419 --> 01:43:33.538
He want me to stay here
until the war is over.

01:43:33.700 --> 01:43:39.809
He asked me to look after
his best friend's fiancée.

01:43:39.979 --> 01:43:42.369
Arn...

01:43:43.339 --> 01:43:47.015
Does someone know anything about him?

01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:51.377
I have not heard anything about Arn,
but little Magnus is well.

01:43:51.539 --> 01:43:55.533
- Magnus?
- Your son.

01:43:59.100 --> 01:44:03.491
Hasn't she told you? You didn't know?

01:44:05.260 --> 01:44:08.296
That ghastly Swerker hag!

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:13.136
His name is Magnus?

01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.852
Thank you!

01:44:17.019 --> 01:44:19.580
He lives.

01:45:08.700 --> 01:45:11.931
- Sir.
- Thank you, Armand.

01:45:14.899 --> 01:45:18.608
Sir, how long can Jerusalem
withstand a siege?

01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:21.620
- Are you afraid?

01:45:21.720 --> 01:45:24.579
A Knight Templar is not
allowed to be afraid, sir.

01:45:27.419 --> 01:45:29.536
Nor is he allowed to lie.

01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:33.335
No, sir...

01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:39.490
I am afraid, but I will
not let that stand in my way.

01:45:46.019 --> 01:45:48.852
You'll become
a great Knight Templar one day, Armand.

01:45:54.379 --> 01:45:57.735
Who is it? Who sent you?

01:45:57.899 --> 01:46:01.528
- What are you doing here?
- I will speak only to Al Ghouti!

01:46:01.700 --> 01:46:05.613
- Al Ghouti? What do you want with him?
- I will speak only to Al Ghouti!

01:46:05.780 --> 01:46:09.852
You filthy Saracen.
Let's make him talk.

01:46:11.939 --> 01:46:14.373
Al Ghouti!

01:46:14.539 --> 01:46:17.895
- My Lord has sent me.
- What does he want?

01:46:18.060 --> 01:46:21.238
He wants to talk to you only.
I will bring you to him.

01:46:21.400 --> 01:46:24.056
- You speak his language.
- Let him go.

01:46:25.939 --> 01:46:30.536
How dare you?
This man is to be interrogated.

01:46:30.700 --> 01:46:35.090
As you wish. But the Grand Master
won't be pleased. Be assured of that.

01:46:37.660 --> 01:46:41.573
Very well. You'll make your
little friend talk.

01:46:43.260 --> 01:46:45.330
Release him.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:49.491
Take me to your master.

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:11.093
So we meet again.

01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:14.809
It is God's will.

01:47:14.979 --> 01:47:17.937
My brother is waiting for you.

01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:20.294
Wait here.

01:47:33.620 --> 01:47:38.568
He will come here.

01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:42.449
- Do you love him?
- Knut?

01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:48.609
I don't know.

01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:53.410
I haven't seen him in a long time.
He's all right, I guess.

01:47:53.580 --> 01:47:55.969
He is the king.

01:47:58.300 --> 01:48:01.132
Do you love Arn Magnusson?

01:48:02.780 --> 01:48:06.249
More than anything else.

01:48:09.379 --> 01:48:16.218
I know that it is a sin
but I love him more than God.

01:48:20.859 --> 01:48:25.694
You will certainly learn
to love Knut.

01:48:42.419 --> 01:48:45.377
What is going on here?!

01:48:45.539 --> 01:48:50.215
Rikissa, I have come
to get my betrothed wife.

01:48:50.379 --> 01:48:55.817
Here in Gudhem, I am the abbess!
I am under the bishop's protection.

01:48:55.979 --> 01:49:02.771
Then I think we should get him here.
Bishop Bengt disappeared when Knut won.

01:49:02.939 --> 01:49:08.890
- Rumor says he fled abroad.
- Get her.

01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:26.013
My queen.

01:49:28.819 --> 01:49:31.618
It was about time.

01:50:03.100 --> 01:50:09.539
Birger Bros? Thank you for
taking care of my boy.

01:50:09.700 --> 01:50:14.568
His name is Magnus
and he is a Folkung now.

01:50:14.740 --> 01:50:19.938
- Does he know that...?
- No, he shall not grow up in shame.

01:50:20.100 --> 01:50:22.489
Cecilia, come here!

01:50:28.580 --> 01:50:32.652
Rikissa! I keep an eye on you now.

01:50:32.819 --> 01:50:37.734
If you do Cecilia any harm,
you'll regret it.

01:50:38.499 --> 01:50:43.527
- Is that understood?
- Answer your future queen!

01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.332
It is understood.

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:55.797
Cecilia. He will come back.

01:50:56.939 --> 01:50:59.408
He will come back to you.

01:51:59.919 --> 01:52:05.167
Welcome. Have a seat.

01:52:10.819 --> 01:52:17.167
You will lose this war.
You know that as well as I do.

01:52:17.339 --> 01:52:22.936
But because you have saved
my life, I will be merciful.

01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:30.337
Leave Jerusalem
without giving battle...

01:52:30.499 --> 01:52:34.651
and you and your brother Templars will
have safe passage to wherever you wish.

01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.329
My duty is to protect Jerusalem.

01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:52.857
Even if the decision was mine to make,
my answer would still be "no".

01:52:53.019 --> 01:52:55.977
Then you will die.

01:52:56.819 --> 01:52:59.811
It's all in the hands of God.

01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:12.689
The king of Jerusalem
sends his blessings.

01:53:14.100 --> 01:53:16.330
The true cross.

01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:22.778
- Now we're safe.
- Thank you, de Ridefort.

01:53:22.939 --> 01:53:24.252
We appreciate the king's kindness.

01:53:24.439 --> 01:53:28.752
is already on his way to Jerusalem.

01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:34.736
Grand Master Torroja.

01:53:34.899 --> 01:53:38.121
The battle for Jerusalem
does not have to be fought in Jerusalem.

01:53:38.221 --> 01:53:39.040
What do you mean?

01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:43.167
Saladin's army is great, but that
also means that it moves slowly.

01:53:43.267 --> 01:53:46.039
Which gives us time to
prepare for the siege.

01:53:46.139 --> 01:53:50.136
Which gives us time to stop him
before he reaches Jerusalem.

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.939
To save time, Saladin will
take the way across Mount Gisard,

01:53:53.039 --> 01:53:55.359
There's a shortcut there
that is used by the Beduin.

01:53:55.459 --> 01:53:56.878
You know of the place.

01:53:56.978 --> 01:53:59.896
A narrow pass through the mountains.

01:54:00.060 --> 01:54:03.131
Saladin would never
expect us to confront them there.

01:54:03.300 --> 01:54:05.938
An ambush could do
Saladin's army a great deal of harm.

01:54:06.100 --> 01:54:08.330
Grand Master.

01:54:08.499 --> 01:54:11.617
We have no evidence that
Saladin will choose that way.

01:54:11.780 --> 01:54:13.277
Unless of course, de Gothia has...

01:54:13.377 --> 01:54:15.329
intelligence from yet
another secret source.

01:54:15.499 --> 01:54:19.458
De Ridefort, this is not the time
or place for personal fights.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:23.658
- De Turenne, what's your opinion?
- It's a wise strategy.

01:54:23.819 --> 01:54:27.495
We could avoid a siege,
if God be willing.

01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:34.412
We should get a force out there at once.
We have nothing to lose and all to win.

01:54:40.260 --> 01:54:42.215
Arn de Gothia.

01:54:42.379 --> 01:54:44.405
The encounters that you've had can't be...

01:54:44.505 --> 01:54:46.976
interpreted as anything
other than the will of God.

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.669
You shall lead our
brothers in this battle.

01:54:49.769 --> 01:54:51.099
You will be in command.

01:54:51.260 --> 01:54:53.819
I am honoured, Grand Master.

01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:48.935
We'll wait in ambush here.

01:55:50.539 --> 01:55:55.772
A sandstorm will soon be upon us.
It would be madness to fight in this.

01:55:55.939 --> 01:55:59.295
It is a godsend.

01:55:59.459 --> 01:56:03.168
Saladin will be taken by surprise.

01:56:03.339 --> 01:56:05.137
Dismount.

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:01.610
Sir?

01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:04.130
Sir?

01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:10.130
Sir!

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.136
Now!

02:01:23.140 --> 02:01:25.858
We have to bring in more troops!

02:01:33.660 --> 02:01:37.334
Sound the retreat.

02:03:09.220 --> 02:03:11.255
He lives.

02:03:12.140 --> 02:03:14.414
Arn lives.

02:03:18.100 --> 02:03:22.810
- Is that true? Is that true?
- Yes.

02:03:39.060 --> 02:03:40.614
You have fought well.

02:03:40.860 --> 02:03:45.214
Thanks to you, we have defeated our
greatest enemy and defended Jerusalem.

02:03:45.379 --> 02:03:47.932
You have served our order faithfully
and I want to make sure

02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:52.497
that you receive your rightful reward
when the day comes.

02:03:54.859 --> 02:03:56.738
De Gothia.

02:03:57.899 --> 02:04:01.938
With great honor you can leave
your service in the army of God

02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:05.217
and return to your former life.

02:04:06.459 --> 02:04:11.772
When your time is due,
this is your way out of here.

02:04:15.539 --> 02:04:18.007
May God keep you until then.

02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:55.219
Thank you.
Thank you, Holy Mother of God.

02:04:55.379 --> 02:05:00.408
Watch over him.
Help him to return home.

02:05:11.539 --> 02:05:25.214
