WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.534
.

00:02.536 --> 00:06.672
- I'm not internal affairs.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.140
- If I find out different...

00:08.141 --> 00:10.175
You'll wish you never
set foot in the 21st.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.211
- This is complete horse--
- [whistles]

00:12.213 --> 00:14.546
Gotta get your hips into it--
like this.

00:14.548 --> 00:16.515
- This'll only take a minute.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.520
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.255
- Your son is a pedophile
and a killer!

00:23.257 --> 00:24.590
- Leave!

00:24.592 --> 00:26.558
- Jay. I'm your partner.
- Yeah.

00:26.560 --> 00:28.327
- Talk to me.
- You don't wanna know.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.295
- Halstead, my office.

00:30.297 --> 00:31.563
I told you to let
the rodiger thing go.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.066
- I think lonnie's gonna
kill another kid.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.535
- You got eyes on you.
I've warned you all I can.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.640
- Yo!

00:41.642 --> 00:43.609
Did you guys catch the game
last night?

00:43.611 --> 00:46.245
18 seconds into overtime,
kane scores the backhander.

00:46.247 --> 00:50.149
Guy's on fire this season.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.684
What's with you two?
- Halstead.

00:57.357 --> 00:58.424
- Commander.

00:58.426 --> 01:02.061
- Halstead.
Have a seat.

01:02.063 --> 01:04.163
- I'll stand.

01:04.165 --> 01:06.198
- All right, after shift
last night, where were you?

01:06.200 --> 01:09.802
- Home.
Why?

01:09.804 --> 01:11.336
- So you're telling us

01:11.338 --> 01:12.571
You didn't go out at all
last night?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.573
- I'm telling you that
I watched the hawks game

01:14.575 --> 01:16.442
And I was in bed by midnight.

01:23.616 --> 01:28.854
- This was taken last night
near broadview and cicero.

01:28.856 --> 01:32.357
The car's registered
to lonnie rodiger.

01:32.359 --> 01:36.261
And that's you...

01:36.263 --> 01:39.565
Two cars behind.

01:39.567 --> 01:42.234
- Okay, so I happened
to be driving home

01:42.236 --> 01:44.837
Behind a pedophile.

01:44.839 --> 01:48.807
- Well, your alleged pedophile
was found dead this morning,

01:48.809 --> 01:51.176
Lafollette park.

01:51.178 --> 01:52.711
- What?

01:52.713 --> 01:56.381
- Someone tied a cord
around his neck.

01:59.719 --> 02:01.820
- So I hope you have
a better alibi

02:01.822 --> 02:03.255
Than watching
a hockey game...

02:03.257 --> 02:06.191
Alone.

02:06.193 --> 02:08.293
- Until this is
straightened out,

02:08.294 --> 02:10.362
You're officially stripped.

02:11.698 --> 02:13.899
- So expect a call
from internal affairs.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.567
They're going to want
to interview you

02:15.569 --> 02:18.237
As soon as possible.

02:18.239 --> 02:20.239
- You mean an interrogation.

02:20.241 --> 02:23.375
- You know
how this works, son.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.315
- Jay.

02:30.317 --> 02:32.151
- I'm the one who tried
to stop that freak.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.485
Now I'm the target.
- I know.

02:33.487 --> 02:35.287
Take this.
It's the number for dan hanes.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.289
He's the best police union rep
there is.

02:37.291 --> 02:38.790
You call him...

02:38.792 --> 02:41.860
And then you tell me
how you want to handle this.

02:41.862 --> 02:45.164
- This is unbelievable.

02:45.166 --> 02:48.867
Hey, jin, I need
the rodiger homicide file.

02:48.869 --> 02:51.737
- As a suspect in his murder,
that's highly unauthorized.

02:51.739 --> 02:53.338
- Come on, man!
- We're done!

02:53.340 --> 02:55.774
I'm back to manning
traffic patterns

02:55.776 --> 02:57.843
For streets and san.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.845
- Told you to be careful,
didn't I?

02:59.847 --> 03:01.380
- I just got suspended.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.614
- You're shocked?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.650
I'm the one who brought you
into this unit.

03:04.652 --> 03:06.385
- Tony, this wasn't me.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.753
- I got to clock in.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.655
Go get yourself a lawyer
right now

03:09.657 --> 03:11.423
And keep your mouth shut.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.529
[siren approaching,
indistinct chatter]

03:17.531 --> 03:20.432
- He--he came out of nowhere,
I swear.

03:20.434 --> 03:22.534
I didn't see him.
- I understand, ma'am,

03:22.536 --> 03:24.436
But we need you
to get out of the way

03:24.438 --> 03:26.872
So these men can do their jobs,
okay?

03:26.874 --> 03:28.473
[radio chatter]

03:28.475 --> 03:30.409
- Old lady plows her boat
through an intersection,

03:30.411 --> 03:32.744
And she's the only one
without a scratch.

03:34.214 --> 03:35.581
- Hey, sit tight.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.382
We're going
to get you out of there.

03:42.522 --> 03:43.689
- Okay!

03:43.691 --> 03:46.525
More!

03:46.527 --> 03:48.260
Hold it!

03:50.530 --> 03:52.631
[low chatter]

03:58.972 --> 04:01.473
- Hey! The driver of this car,
he decked my guy!

04:01.475 --> 04:02.874
- You ungrateful prick!

04:02.876 --> 04:04.776
- You all right?
- Yeah.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.778
- It wasn't his fault.
Why'd he run?

04:06.780 --> 04:09.448
- Check the car.

04:16.723 --> 04:19.257
- Hey!
What you got for this?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.793
- [grunting]

04:23.596 --> 04:25.664
- Damn.

04:33.973 --> 04:37.676
- No wonder
he was in such a hurry.

04:37.678 --> 04:46.451
.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.755
- Well, it's evidence
in a murder case,

04:49.757 --> 04:51.556
So it could be impounded
for a while.

04:51.558 --> 04:53.558
- Well, my insurance isn't going
to cover a loaner.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.494
Will the cpd
provide me with one?

04:55.496 --> 04:58.430
Go ahead and pick one out
from the lot.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.632
Go talk to sergeant platt,
front desk.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.468
She'll give you
the keys, okay?

05:03.470 --> 05:04.870
The owner
of the car's clean.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.772
The car was reported stolen
from a parking garage

05:06.774 --> 05:08.373
About a week ago.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.975
- Hey, the torso recovered
from the trunk

05:09.977 --> 05:11.510
Had an artificial hip,

05:11.512 --> 05:13.445
So I asked jin to trace
the serial number

05:13.447 --> 05:16.982
- Doing it that way's actually
faster than a dna test.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.084
Only takes me a couple hours
instead of a couple weeks.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.952
- It's a good thing you're back
to doing your day job

05:20.954 --> 05:25.357
Instead of personal favors.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.592
Keep hitting the bushes.

05:29.462 --> 05:33.532
- Hey, so you think halstead
did it or what?

05:33.534 --> 05:34.966
Lindsay, come on,
it's a question.

05:34.968 --> 05:36.468
You never know around here
sometimes.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.537
- What's that supposed to mean?

05:38.539 --> 05:40.706
- Nothing.

05:43.776 --> 05:46.912
- To be honest,
I don't feel any sympathy.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.481
- Do the police have any idea
who did it?

05:49.483 --> 05:53.819
- We're still trying
to piece that together.

05:53.821 --> 05:55.454
Gail, do you have any milk
for this?

05:55.456 --> 05:57.022
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you.

05:57.024 --> 05:59.591
Sorry.
- I'm sorry.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.367
They suspended me.

06:08.369 --> 06:10.068
They think I did it.

06:10.070 --> 06:14.005
So if you did something...

06:14.007 --> 06:16.541
Then tell me now,

06:16.543 --> 06:20.412
And we'll figure this out
together.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.914
- Jay, I have been fantasizing
about it for years,

06:22.916 --> 06:25.117
But I didn't do it.

06:25.119 --> 06:27.753
After all you've done
for this family,

06:27.755 --> 06:30.622
If you need me to confess...

06:30.624 --> 06:32.491
I will.

06:34.000 --> 06:40.074

06:41.634 --> 06:43.769
- Hey!
He's dead because of you!

06:43.771 --> 06:44.936
- Oh, man.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.405
- None of this
would have happened

06:46.407 --> 06:50.475
- Lonnie brought this on himself
and you know it.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.184
- You're a man short.

07:01.053 --> 07:03.622
- Halstead's under investigation
for murder.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.756
You want to cash in on that?

07:04.758 --> 07:06.725
- I deserve to be
in intelligence.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.960
An opportunity
is an opportunity.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.162
[knocking on door]

07:10.164 --> 07:12.764
- I got a match
on the artificial hip.

07:12.766 --> 07:15.434
Dr. Richard elliot...
The dna consultant

07:15.436 --> 07:17.536
Who testified
for the state's attorney.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.670
- Yeah, I knew him.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.472
Helped put away
some major hitters.

07:20.474 --> 07:23.175
- Well, his wife filed a missing
persons report on him yesterday.

07:23.177 --> 07:26.611
- Nice work.

07:28.881 --> 07:33.518
Let's take a ride.

07:33.520 --> 07:34.820
- He left his office
two nights ago,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.621
And he never came home.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.190
He called me when he got
on lakeshore drive,

07:38.192 --> 07:41.126
But then he never answered
his phone after that.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.128
- As a consultant
for the prosecution,

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
I assume
he's gotten death threats.

07:45.132 --> 07:48.500
- He's testified in hundreds
of dna cases.

07:48.502 --> 07:50.936
I told him
I wanted him to retire,

07:50.938 --> 07:55.006
To go back to teaching,
but he loved his work.

07:55.008 --> 07:58.176
- Was he about to testify
in any upcoming trials?

08:08.588 --> 08:10.622
- The trial was supposed
to start tomorrow.

08:10.624 --> 08:15.827
- This clown, nicholas djurovic,
aka nick the dj.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.230
- Ma'am, we're going to need you
to go downtown

08:18.232 --> 08:21.666
With the patrolman to...
Deal with the remains.

08:23.903 --> 08:28.540
- [sobbing]

08:28.542 --> 08:30.575
- "the remains," huh?

08:32.645 --> 08:35.113
Alvin, I want you
to do a drive-by.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.982
- Yeah, just shoot me the name
and I'll suit up.

08:36.984 --> 08:40.719
So you'll let me know
what's going on with halstead?

08:40.721 --> 08:43.154
- I told him not to pursue
his vendetta.

08:43.155 --> 08:46.091
- So we're just gonna to let
this kid twist in the wind?

08:46.093 --> 08:47.959
- He created this problem.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.561
He can't figure his way
out of it,

08:49.563 --> 08:51.596
He doesn't belong
in our unit anyways.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.032
- All right.

08:55.969 --> 08:59.604
He got jammed up on
an aggravated assault charge--

08:59.606 --> 09:01.640
- I want your opinion,
I'll ask.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.948
[muffled electronica]

09:09.950 --> 09:13.785
- Djurovic, this is cpd!

09:13.787 --> 09:15.554
- Chicago pd!

09:15.556 --> 09:18.223
Woman: Oh!

09:21.561 --> 09:24.195
[thumping electronica]

09:24.197 --> 09:25.330
- Clear!
- Clear!

09:25.332 --> 09:33.939
â™ª

09:46.686 --> 09:48.787
- [screams]

09:48.789 --> 09:50.922
- Where you going?

09:52.124 --> 09:55.727
- [gasps, whimpers]

09:55.729 --> 09:57.762
Can't just...
Break in on me...

09:57.764 --> 10:00.365
[wheezes]
- you want to run, nicky?

10:00.367 --> 10:03.068
- Help me!
- Hey...

10:03.070 --> 10:06.972
In an erotic asphyxiation
situation here, bud.

10:06.974 --> 10:08.640
- Can't you see?
Just--

10:08.642 --> 10:10.375
[muttering shrilly]

10:10.377 --> 10:12.944
- What, do we pull him up?
- Nah. Let him hang there.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.080
- Got a warrant...

10:15.082 --> 10:16.648
- Do you have an idea, al?

10:16.650 --> 10:18.116
- I think I might.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.385
- Uhh...
[mutters]

10:20.387 --> 10:22.320
[strangling]
- what do you think, nicky?

10:22.322 --> 10:25.390
- Help me...[muttering]
- huh?

10:25.392 --> 10:27.325
- Oh, you got no right!

10:27.327 --> 10:30.362
- Right underneath him.
- Yeah, right there.

10:30.364 --> 10:31.930
- Pretty high up here.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.732
- Let 'er rip!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.170
- Uh--uhh!
[muttering]

10:39.172 --> 10:41.906
Aah!

10:43.876 --> 10:45.377
[groans]

10:45.379 --> 10:47.412
- Well, that didn't work.

10:47.414 --> 10:50.849
- I'm gonna sue you.
I'm gonna sue the city.

10:50.851 --> 10:53.652
I'm gonna sue your mother
for having you.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.387
I'm gonna sue your father
for even thinking about doing--

10:55.389 --> 10:56.921
- Shut up.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.890
You're facing 20 years
for murder,

10:58.892 --> 11:01.860
And it all hinged
on dr. Elliot's testimony.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.130
Now, that sounds like motive
to hack him up to me.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.766
- Am I shedding tears
for that doctor?

11:07.768 --> 11:09.668
Nah.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.403
Do you think I'd be throwing
a going-away party

11:11.405 --> 11:15.674
If I wasn't actually...
Going away?

11:15.676 --> 11:19.044
- So you're saying you're guilty
of the murder they got you on?

11:19.046 --> 11:23.181
- Got to admit,
now that the doc's dead,

11:23.183 --> 11:25.083
I'm suddenly feeling
not guilty.

11:25.085 --> 11:30.288
You're the luckiest defendant
in illinois criminal history.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.190
- Recognize him?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.758
- It's not the guy who ran.

11:33.760 --> 11:34.993
- You sure?

11:34.995 --> 11:37.228
- Yeah, positive.

11:37.230 --> 11:39.397
- Well, time of death
on the torso

11:39.399 --> 11:41.232
Was determined
to be 48 hours ago,

11:41.234 --> 11:42.967
Same time djurovic
was visiting his mother

11:42.969 --> 11:44.402
In a nursing home
in milwaukee.

11:44.404 --> 11:46.438
They've got him signed in
and on camera.

11:48.007 --> 11:49.407
Maybe he farmed out the hit.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.476
- No, it doesn't make sense.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.846
But he's the one criminals farm
this sort of thing out to.

11:57.316 --> 12:00.351
- You mind coming to take a look
at a couple mug shots?

12:00.353 --> 12:01.786
- Sure.

12:01.788 --> 12:03.722
Good to see you again.

12:03.724 --> 12:04.956
- You, too.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.726
I wish it was
under better circumstances.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.394
How's your sister?

12:09.396 --> 12:14.466
- Recently paroled ex-cons
dr. Elliot testified against.

12:14.468 --> 12:17.736
- You recognize anybody?

12:20.940 --> 12:22.774
- That guy.

12:22.776 --> 12:24.509
That's the guy that
we pulled out of the car.

12:24.511 --> 12:27.178
- Tony johnston,
a member of the northsiders.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.914
- They're a hardcore
white supremacist gang

12:29.916 --> 12:31.149
That formed
in stateville prison.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.317
- Yeah.

12:32.319 --> 12:33.451
Johnston did time
for multiple rapes,

12:33.453 --> 12:35.453
Was released on appeal
two weeks ago,

12:35.455 --> 12:39.390
Owns a salvage yard
over on west lake.

12:42.962 --> 12:44.395
- Chicago pd!

12:46.465 --> 12:48.366
- Antonio, get the gauge.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.202
- Got it.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.376
- [groans]
that didn't work.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.812
- It's got a gate bolt.

13:25.371 --> 13:28.173
- Hey, come here.

13:32.077 --> 13:34.212
- Hey, careful.
That's hydrochloric acid.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.281
- Hmm? Oh!
[sizzling]

13:36.283 --> 13:49.928
.

13:49.930 --> 13:53.198
- So johnston didn't
accidentally slip into that tub.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.333
M.E. Found strangulation marks
on his neck,

13:55.335 --> 13:57.869
Or what was left of it.
- What about his phone?

13:57.871 --> 13:59.604
- Two dozen calls to his lawyer
in the last 24 hours.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.208
- All right, take sumner,
go see johnston's mouthpiece.

14:03.210 --> 14:05.376
See what you can dig up.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.378
No, wait. Hold on.

14:07.380 --> 14:10.014
Antonio, you go with her.

14:10.016 --> 14:13.017
- What's wrong with me
and sumner?

14:13.019 --> 14:14.452
Say it.

14:14.454 --> 14:17.522
- I think it's better
if partners are male-female.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.992
- Let's go.
- Erin.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.961
- Kiss my ass.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.600
Your attorney-client privileges
are over.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.603
We found tony johnston
in an acid bath.

14:31.605 --> 14:34.606
Why would he want
dr. Elliot dead?

14:34.608 --> 14:36.875
- Well, he believed
elliot misread the dna evidence

14:36.877 --> 14:38.943
In favor of the prosecution.

14:38.945 --> 14:41.512
In his mind,
he spent seven years inside

14:41.514 --> 14:43.348
For a crime he didn't commit.

14:43.350 --> 14:45.950
- What do you think?
- I led tony's appeal

14:45.952 --> 14:47.318
And got him an early release
from prison.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.220
So obviously,
dr. Elliot's research

14:49.222 --> 14:50.622
Had some holes in it.

14:50.624 --> 14:53.558
- Sounds like you get
pretty close to your clients.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.894
- I believe in justice
being done.

14:55.896 --> 14:59.030
You spend years helping people
get through a corrupt system,

14:59.032 --> 15:01.933
You begin caring
how it affects their lives.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.435
- He called you two dozen times
in 24 hours.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.237
What was so important?

15:06.239 --> 15:08.539
- Tony feared for his life.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.108
- Who was he so afraid of?

15:10.110 --> 15:12.977
- A man by the name
of jacob sims.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.545
He's the head
of the northsiders.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.147
While tony was in prison,

15:16.149 --> 15:18.182
Sims took over
his salvage yard

15:18.184 --> 15:20.952
And used it
to traffic in stolen cars.

15:20.954 --> 15:23.521
After his release, the two had
a falling out over business.

15:23.523 --> 15:26.090
- And what did johnston think
you could do to protect him?

15:26.092 --> 15:28.526
- I was merely offering
legal advice.

15:28.528 --> 15:32.697
- Legal advice
for an illegal business?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.966
Come on, humor me.

15:34.968 --> 15:37.568
- Working with a man
like sims--

15:37.570 --> 15:40.438
You cut your losses
and you run.

16:00.726 --> 16:03.061
- Stalking the rodigers,

16:03.063 --> 16:04.729
The multiple complaints
on record against you--

16:04.731 --> 16:08.566
I've seen cops flushed down
the toilet for less than this.

16:10.436 --> 16:13.071
- I'm going to go now.

16:13.073 --> 16:16.507
- I'd hoped
that you'd be smarter.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.710
Give iad a formal statement,

16:18.712 --> 16:22.046
And we can all avoid
a very messy hearing tomorrow.

16:25.084 --> 16:29.087
- All you have on me
is a few pictures of me driving.

16:31.357 --> 16:33.391
[door opens, closes]

16:34.693 --> 16:37.328
- Halstead.
Do you think he did it?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.098
- If I knew,
you think I'd tell you?

16:40.100 --> 16:41.766
- Okay.

16:41.768 --> 16:43.501
Second reason
I called you in here,

16:43.503 --> 16:45.636
You should have kept
better eyes on him.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.372
- You're saying
this is my fault?

16:47.374 --> 16:49.707
- He's your guy.
You brought him in.

16:49.709 --> 16:53.044
- You're judging me,
after everything you've done?

16:53.046 --> 16:55.346
Iad put you in cuffs
a week ago.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.582
- Yeah, cuffs I got out of.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.418
I told you, day one, you want
to bring this kid in our unit,

17:00.420 --> 17:01.786
Fine.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.788
But I hold you responsible
for his actions.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.623
[knocking on door]

17:07.291 --> 17:10.461
That hasn't changed, antonio.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.695
Yeah?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.231
- Northsiders' chop shop.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.766
I made a list
of all the license plates

17:14.768 --> 17:16.334
Connected
to the cars we found,

17:16.336 --> 17:17.801
Put an alert out,
just in case.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.804
Half an hour ago, rosemont
police spotted a mustang

17:19.806 --> 17:21.439
With one of the stolen plates

17:21.441 --> 17:24.809
In the parking lot
of the convention center.

17:27.413 --> 17:30.748
- Rosemont pd, in position
and ready to move in.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.217
- Rosemont pd,
stand down, stand down.

17:33.219 --> 17:37.388
We will wait for the suspect
to be identified.

17:37.390 --> 17:40.358
I want all these exits covered
and set up for takeaways.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.394
Maintain eyes on the vehicle.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.562
- Well...

17:44.564 --> 17:45.763
Talk about the worst place
in the world

17:45.765 --> 17:47.298
To take down a suspect,
right?

17:47.300 --> 17:49.634
- [laughs]
- olinsky, you I.D. Sims?

17:49.636 --> 17:51.636
- Yeah, on his way out,

17:51.638 --> 17:55.573
And he's got a brand-new
shiny akm.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.676
- All right, nobody pops off
until sims gets the artillery

17:58.678 --> 18:00.778
Into his vehicle,
he's out of this parking lot.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.847
We'll just box him in.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.087
Patrol, position to the front.

18:09.089 --> 18:11.289
- 10-4, moving in.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.406
- Suspect unarmed.
Moving in.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.775
- He's jumping the gun.
- Rosemont pd, pull back!

18:30.777 --> 18:33.211
Pull back, rosemont!

18:33.213 --> 18:35.213
- Stop! Police!

18:37.783 --> 18:42.420
[people screaming]

18:43.689 --> 18:45.356
- Everybody, watch your aim!

18:45.358 --> 18:47.458
We got civilians all over!

19:04.643 --> 19:06.644
- [grunts]

19:08.814 --> 19:10.548
- Police!
Guns down.

19:14.219 --> 19:15.786
- Where is he?

19:17.756 --> 19:19.790
Everybody, spread out!

19:19.792 --> 19:22.593
Find this guy!

19:22.595 --> 19:24.428
- Everybody
stay where you are!

19:24.430 --> 19:26.931
Calm down!
- Go that way.

19:26.933 --> 19:34.672
.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.908
- The rosemont police officer
who was shot

19:36.910 --> 19:38.943
Died on the way
to the hospital.

19:38.945 --> 19:42.246
Wife, two kids.

19:42.248 --> 19:46.717
We lost that guy.

19:46.719 --> 19:50.621
So we go down whatever dark hole
we have to to find him.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.699
- Hey.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.268
- Hey.
- You doing all right?

20:04.270 --> 20:06.771
- Yep.
- Yeah?

20:10.209 --> 20:13.377
Is this your first time
firing your weapon?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.347
- Yeah.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.617
- All right,
well, when you finish up,

20:19.619 --> 20:21.385
Let's get out of here, yeah?

20:26.592 --> 20:28.826
- I appreciate you meeting me.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.662
What the hell?
- Did you do it?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.397
- I already told you--

20:33.399 --> 20:35.600
- Did you do it?
- No!

20:37.869 --> 20:39.537
If I was going
to kill lonnie rodiger,

20:39.539 --> 20:41.239
I would have done it
the night he raped

20:41.241 --> 20:43.541
And he killed ben corson.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.977
And I was this close!

20:54.953 --> 20:56.721
- Lonnie rodiger's
homicide file.

20:56.723 --> 20:58.356
No one knows
where you got that.

21:05.297 --> 21:08.799
- Did tony johnston mention
anything about jacob sims?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.935
- Nothing specific
I can recall.

21:10.937 --> 21:14.772
- No stash house or,
you know, hangout?

21:14.774 --> 21:17.541
Someplace off the radar
we might find him?

21:17.543 --> 21:20.411
- You have to understand
I was merely johnston's lawyer.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.446
We didn't discuss much else
other than his case.

21:22.448 --> 21:25.283
- Dad wanted me to tell you
dinner's ready.

21:25.285 --> 21:27.718
- Okay, you two start eating.
I'll be right in.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.287
- Is everything okay?

21:29.289 --> 21:32.323
- Yeah, it's fine, honey.
It's just work.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.658
- Okay.

21:37.329 --> 21:42.333
- Look, I don't have
to tell you, sims is unhinged.

21:42.335 --> 21:44.035
He could put two
and two together,

21:44.037 --> 21:46.971
Figure out that...
You said something.

21:49.308 --> 21:53.778
There's a possibility
he might show up here.

21:55.580 --> 21:58.816
- I don't know.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.985
Maybe I was hoping
I'd be one of those cops

22:00.987 --> 22:03.621
That go their whole careers
without firing a single shot.

22:03.623 --> 22:05.656
- Well, you want to be upstairs,
right?

22:05.658 --> 22:07.325
- Yeah, of course.

22:07.327 --> 22:08.926
- Well, then I think it's good
you popped your cherry now,

22:08.928 --> 22:10.695
Because I promise you, this is
not going to be the last time

22:10.697 --> 22:13.497
You fire your weapon.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.433
- What about you?
What's your trick?

22:15.435 --> 22:16.567
- I don't really think
about it.

22:16.569 --> 22:18.736
- Oh, so you just bury
your feelings,

22:18.738 --> 22:20.004
Like a typical guy.

22:20.006 --> 22:21.405
- No, it's not intentional
or anything.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.407
I just, really,
it doesn't bother me.

22:23.409 --> 22:26.577
- You don't ever think
about the suspect you killed?

22:26.579 --> 22:30.381
- My uncle used to tell me
this story about two monks...

22:30.383 --> 22:34.418
- Who find a wayward maiden
on the riverbank, right?

22:34.420 --> 22:36.120
And one monk says
to the other monk...

22:36.122 --> 22:39.357
This is the younger monk.
- Okay.

22:39.359 --> 22:41.992
- This is after
they cross the river.

22:41.994 --> 22:43.361
The--

22:43.363 --> 22:45.062
Uh...

22:45.064 --> 22:48.432
The upshot is don't carry
your problems around with you.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.870
- Monks?

22:52.872 --> 22:54.905
- Monks.
- [laughing]

22:54.907 --> 22:57.041
Thanks for the--
thanks for the beer.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.111
I'm around
anytime you need to talk.

23:00.113 --> 23:02.980
All right?
- Yeah.

23:21.166 --> 23:22.600
I'm so sorry.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.502
- No, I'm--

23:25.404 --> 23:29.006
No, hey, it's okay.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.408
[engine starts]

23:46.691 --> 23:47.892
[beep]

23:47.894 --> 23:49.660
[beep beep beep]

23:49.662 --> 23:51.095
[knocking on door]

24:01.840 --> 24:03.874
- Hey.

24:03.876 --> 24:05.142
I figured
you might be drinking.

24:05.144 --> 24:07.111
A man shouldn't
be drinking alone.

24:12.150 --> 24:15.152
What, were you raised
in a trailer park?

24:15.154 --> 24:17.188
- Works the same, right?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.759
- [sighs]
yeah.

24:21.761 --> 24:25.129
[both chuckle]

24:25.131 --> 24:30.067
- You know, I had my piece
and badge taken away from me.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.169
It's the worst feeling
in the world.

24:32.171 --> 24:34.672
- Was it the browning thing?

24:36.675 --> 24:40.678
- Well...

24:40.680 --> 24:41.879
[clears throat]

24:41.881 --> 24:44.748
No one expected us
to deliver him alive,

24:44.750 --> 24:47.084
So...

24:47.086 --> 24:51.222
We just decided not
to deliver him at all.

24:52.824 --> 24:56.527
- Did voight make you do it?

24:56.529 --> 24:59.163
- No one made anyone
do anything that night.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.901
- I didn't kill lonnie.

25:03.903 --> 25:07.805
- Hey...

25:07.807 --> 25:09.273
It's no sweat.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.285
- Can I run something by you?

25:21.287 --> 25:22.253
- Yeah, yeah.

25:22.255 --> 25:24.255
[clears throat]

25:27.125 --> 25:32.196
- So phil rodiger
gives his statement,

25:32.198 --> 25:34.899
And he says...

25:34.901 --> 25:37.167
That his son never came home
that night.

25:41.106 --> 25:44.275
But I know he did.

25:51.283 --> 25:55.653
- Where the hell
is my grenade?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.955
- Your what?

25:57.957 --> 26:00.991
- Oh, it's a paperweight.
[slams drawer]

26:00.993 --> 26:03.627
A gift that I got
when I graduated the academy.

26:03.629 --> 26:05.796
If it's not nailed down
around here...

26:05.798 --> 26:07.831
- Hey,
platt's taking donations

26:07.833 --> 26:09.333
For the rosemont cop
that was killed.

26:09.335 --> 26:11.635
- Dig deep.

26:14.739 --> 26:16.140
Much appreciated.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.576
- Burgess.
- Better not cry poor.

26:20.011 --> 26:22.112
- Hey, I don't care what voight
or anyone else thinks about you.

26:22.114 --> 26:23.747
As long as you honor
that chair you're sitting in,

26:23.749 --> 26:25.182
You'll be right by me.

26:25.184 --> 26:26.717
[knocks twice]

26:26.719 --> 26:28.152
- Hey.

26:28.154 --> 26:31.221
I see I'm not the only one
without a social life here.

26:31.223 --> 26:34.592
So investigators searching the
crime scene at the salvage yard

26:34.594 --> 26:36.293
Found a couple hundred grams
of meth,

26:36.295 --> 26:40.197
A cache of weapons,
and this.

26:40.199 --> 26:42.633
That lawyer
you interviewed earlier--

26:42.635 --> 26:45.302
I think you're going to want
to bring her in.

26:46.705 --> 26:49.773
[panting, moaning]

26:52.644 --> 26:55.846
- Turn it off.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.314
Please.

26:57.316 --> 27:03.387
.

27:03.389 --> 27:04.288
[moaning on video]

27:05.690 --> 27:07.091
- I'm assuming the cameraman

27:07.093 --> 27:09.026
Isn't your husband.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.828
- Of course not.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.830
- Then who is it?

27:14.766 --> 27:18.636
- Want me to bring your husband
down here to watch?

27:18.638 --> 27:20.304
- Tony johnston.

27:22.407 --> 27:24.408
I was forced into it.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.411
- Looks like you were
enjoying it to me.

27:27.413 --> 27:31.815
- I was working on johnston's
appeal when I met jacob sims.

27:31.817 --> 27:35.252
I needed his testimony
for the case.

27:35.254 --> 27:37.655
Over the last year,
he began stalking me.

27:37.657 --> 27:41.659
- Why didn't you reach out
to the police?

27:41.661 --> 27:43.894
- You know their reputation.

27:43.896 --> 27:46.296
He threatened me.

27:46.298 --> 27:49.867
He said if I didn't,
he'd charge a family tax.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.368
Either I have sex with him,

27:51.370 --> 27:53.904
Or he kills my husband
and my daughter.

27:53.906 --> 27:56.907
He said he's send that video
to everyone I know.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.418
Maybe johnston and sims
had a falling out over her?

28:07.420 --> 28:10.454
- That doesn't explain
why they hacked up dr. Elliot.

28:10.456 --> 28:14.725
- I have a ci
who used to be a northsider.

28:14.727 --> 28:17.261
Maybe he knows something
about sims.

28:17.263 --> 28:20.197
- You're tight
with a white supremacist?

28:20.199 --> 28:22.700
- Like this.

28:27.105 --> 28:28.739
- Hey.
- Hey.

28:28.741 --> 28:30.374
- Can you...
- Yeah, of course.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.409
- Thanks.
- [clears throat]

28:32.411 --> 28:34.344
Hey.
- I'm not a home wrecker.

28:34.346 --> 28:35.846
- What, are you kidding me?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.347
You're like the most
honest cop in this building.

28:37.349 --> 28:39.249
- Then we can agree
what happened never happened.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.451
- Hey, burgess, look.

28:40.453 --> 28:42.386
- Please.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.854
Let's keep it as friends.

28:48.760 --> 28:51.829
- Erased from my memory.
All right?

28:58.937 --> 29:02.973
- Ruzek was just letting me know
that I was double-parked,

29:02.975 --> 29:05.075
So I'm going to go move it.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.280
Oh, right, yeah.
I've been looking for that.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.983
Let me see, um...
Let me see how much I have.

29:12.985 --> 29:15.753
Oh, great.
There you go.

29:35.807 --> 29:36.774
- [clears throat]

30:01.499 --> 30:04.802
- In the statement
you gave the detectives,

30:04.804 --> 30:07.971
You said that you didn't
see lonnie after 10:00 p.M.,

30:07.973 --> 30:11.341
That he went for a drive
and he never came back.

30:17.448 --> 30:20.484
I was following lonnie
that night,

30:20.486 --> 30:23.320
And not long
after these pictures were taken

30:23.322 --> 30:26.957
I watched him walk
into your house.

30:35.433 --> 30:39.503
Lonnie got tired of hunting,
so he went home.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.105
And according
to the time of death,

30:42.107 --> 30:47.611
He was killed an hour
after I took this photo.

30:52.450 --> 30:56.320
Your son wasn't killed
in lafollette park, was he?

30:58.056 --> 31:00.457
- You got no idea
what you're talking about.

31:07.065 --> 31:08.899
- Phil, where you going?

31:15.106 --> 31:17.174
You killed him.

31:19.878 --> 31:22.212
- He was sick!

31:24.315 --> 31:28.151
All those years,
I defended him.

31:28.153 --> 31:31.188
[breathing heavily]

31:39.597 --> 31:42.499
- Still smoking those buglers?

31:42.501 --> 31:44.334
I checked
with your parole officer.

31:44.336 --> 31:47.070
Supposedly
you're a model citizen,

31:47.072 --> 31:49.072
Except for that dui
you got last month.

31:49.074 --> 31:51.541
- Bears lost.
I went a little overboard.

31:51.543 --> 31:53.410
So what do you need?

31:53.412 --> 31:55.612
- I know you left
the northsiders years ago,

31:55.614 --> 31:58.482
But I need the lowdown
on their shot caller jacob sims.

31:58.484 --> 32:02.052
- I saw it on the news.
Killed a cop.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.087
That was me,
I wouldn't stick around.

32:04.089 --> 32:06.590
- Yeah, we got alerts out
at o'hare, midway,

32:06.592 --> 32:08.258
Union station, the works.

32:08.260 --> 32:10.027
Figured you'd know

32:10.029 --> 32:12.296
If the northsiders had
an underground railroad.

32:12.298 --> 32:14.531
- You know what the problem is
with being legit?

32:14.533 --> 32:17.134
I actually got
to pay the bills.

32:17.136 --> 32:18.602
- There's a reward
for this guy.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.404
You give me something
that checks out,

32:20.406 --> 32:22.339
I'll make sure you get it.

32:26.010 --> 32:27.945
- Northsiders are
the only crew in chicago

32:27.947 --> 32:29.479
That get away
with making meth.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.615
They use a big rig
with false walls

32:31.617 --> 32:34.484
That leaves every day
from chicago to indianapolis.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.486
- You got a name
for this trucking company?

32:36.488 --> 32:39.122
- Naw. They changed it
every few months.

32:39.124 --> 32:43.660
But I do remember they used
a trucking yard on south racine.

32:43.662 --> 32:47.130
- A little something for now.

32:49.600 --> 32:51.001
- Which one?

32:51.003 --> 32:52.402
- That's what we have
to figure out.

32:52.404 --> 32:53.670
- If sims is in one of them,

32:53.672 --> 32:56.139
We'll catch
his body heat on this.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.175
- All right, hang back
until we need you.

33:02.113 --> 33:03.680
- When's the next rig
to indianapolis?

33:03.682 --> 33:08.518
- There's three of them--
dock 3, 12, and 16.

33:08.520 --> 33:11.521
- Antonio,
scan docks 12 and 16.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.023
We got number 3.

33:13.025 --> 33:15.125
Why don't you go wait
in the office, sir?

33:15.127 --> 33:17.160
[scanner whirring]

33:17.162 --> 33:18.695
- I need an image.

33:41.619 --> 33:45.122
- Chicago pd, jacob sims!

33:48.626 --> 33:50.594
[gunshots]

33:56.401 --> 33:58.301
- Drop it!

33:58.303 --> 34:05.275
.

34:05.277 --> 34:06.810
- I got him! Go!

34:06.812 --> 34:08.745
Adam?
- [gasps] I got hit.

34:08.746 --> 34:10.380
- Come on, let me see.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.581
All right, all right,
the vest stopped it.

34:12.583 --> 34:14.150
You're okay.
You're okay.

34:14.152 --> 34:15.485
- Yah!
- Take a deep breath.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.054
You're all right.

34:38.342 --> 34:39.708
- Stay down.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.143
Stay down!

34:41.146 --> 34:42.279
Stay down!

34:42.281 --> 34:43.513
- Aah!

34:48.619 --> 34:50.754
[coughing]

34:56.393 --> 34:57.794
- That was good intel.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.865
You can write the report
on this one.

35:03.334 --> 35:05.368
Cuff him.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.638
- Should I include the part

35:08.640 --> 35:13.743
Where you shot
an unarmed suspect?

35:13.745 --> 35:16.813
- No, you can leave
that part out.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.152
- [groaning]

35:22.154 --> 35:24.688
Ah! Aah!

35:29.127 --> 35:31.294
- So jacob sims...

35:31.296 --> 35:33.630
He had some interesting
things to say.

35:33.632 --> 35:38.201
- I'm just happy that
you finally caught that animal.

35:38.203 --> 35:40.871
- We got your case files sent
over from the states attorney.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.405
Dr. Elliot was the reason

35:42.407 --> 35:44.574
You lost eight
of your last ten cases,

35:44.576 --> 35:47.177
And you were set to face him
in court next month.

35:47.179 --> 35:50.580
- I have multiple cases
next month.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.617
- We also spoke
with your law partners.

35:53.619 --> 35:55.852
They said with your record of
wins versus losses lately,

35:55.854 --> 35:58.188
You're close to being
voted out of the firm.

35:58.190 --> 36:01.358
- I think elliot was about
to cost you your partnership,

36:01.360 --> 36:03.326
Your stake in the firm,

36:03.328 --> 36:06.196
Million-dollar townhouse
in lincoln park.

36:10.701 --> 36:13.703
- Are you insinuating
that I killed dr. Elliot?

36:13.705 --> 36:15.906
- No.

36:15.908 --> 36:17.841
That little sex tape you made?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.277
I'm thinking
you seduced sims and johnston

36:20.279 --> 36:21.912
Into doing it for you.

36:21.914 --> 36:24.314
One screws up
disposing the body...

36:24.316 --> 36:27.184
- The other kills him
so he can't talk.

36:27.186 --> 36:30.520
- Then you sic us on sims
to clean up your mess.

36:33.224 --> 36:34.758
- I am a victim.

36:34.760 --> 36:38.428
Are you going to believe
the accusations of a racist,

36:38.430 --> 36:42.465
Sociopathic ex-con, or me?

36:42.467 --> 36:45.202
- Personally?
The first one.

36:49.607 --> 36:52.742
- Prove it.

36:54.478 --> 36:57.380
- We're just going to kick her?
- What do we got?

36:57.382 --> 36:59.316
- Evidence of her
with those two suspects.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.817
- What, two ex-cons
and a sex tape?

37:00.819 --> 37:02.319
No, kick her.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.653
File it
with the states attorney,

37:03.655 --> 37:06.223
See how far it goes.

37:09.493 --> 37:12.295
- Heard they brought in
phil rodiger.

37:12.297 --> 37:14.631
- I never wanted to believe

37:14.633 --> 37:19.636
My son was capable
of such a thing.

37:19.638 --> 37:23.840
I found some pictures
on his computer--

37:23.842 --> 37:26.009
Boys...

37:26.011 --> 37:28.645
The same age
as the corson kid.

37:30.948 --> 37:35.619
I confronted him.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.255
- How did you kill lonnie?

37:41.325 --> 37:44.728
- We fought.

37:44.730 --> 37:49.866
I picked up a belt...

37:49.868 --> 37:51.868
And I kept choking him.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.838
[sobbing]

37:57.541 --> 37:59.943
- And then you dropped his body
in the park.

38:06.817 --> 38:09.586
- [sobbing]

38:14.292 --> 38:17.494
- Hey, good to have you back.

38:17.496 --> 38:19.696
- These are yours.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.032
- We all going for a drink?

38:22.034 --> 38:26.002
- No, I got someplace
I got to be.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.972
- Hey.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.441
I never doubted you
for a second, bro.

38:40.051 --> 38:42.652
- What's up with you
and rebel without a cause?

38:42.654 --> 38:44.788
- Ruzek?
[laughs]

38:44.790 --> 38:46.723
Nothing.
He's engaged.

38:46.725 --> 38:49.092
- I have been a cop a long time,
burgess.

38:49.094 --> 38:51.861
I know body language,
and yours said you got felt up.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.063
- Sergeant, no way.

38:53.065 --> 38:55.098
- How old are you?
- I'm 26.

38:56.534 --> 38:58.368
- I'll tell you what, burgess.

38:58.370 --> 38:59.969
- What?

38:59.971 --> 39:02.972
- Why don't you have fun
while you're young?

39:02.974 --> 39:04.974
God knows
I've tasted my share

39:04.976 --> 39:09.879
Of forbidden district
house fruit over the years.

39:14.885 --> 39:18.955
- Hey, al, you ever get cold
feet before you got married?

39:18.957 --> 39:20.957
- Getting second thoughts
there, kid?

39:20.959 --> 39:23.126
- No.
I mean, maybe, yeah.

39:23.128 --> 39:24.794
Been doing a lot of thinking.

39:24.796 --> 39:27.897
My life just flashed
before my eyes, so...

39:27.899 --> 39:32.001
- Yeah, well, my daughter's
my greatest blessing.

39:32.003 --> 39:34.904
Now wendy seems like
she'd make a great mom, but--

39:34.906 --> 39:37.006
- Yeah. Yeah.

39:37.008 --> 39:39.376
- If your marriage
doesn't work out, so be it.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.544
But...

39:41.546 --> 39:44.381
Your kids,
they last a lifetime.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.143
- And it knocked down
[knock at door]

40:13.145 --> 40:16.112
Three blocks around the house,
but no one was hurt.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.749
[knocking continues]

40:25.656 --> 40:27.924
- What are you doing here?

40:32.596 --> 40:35.999
So that's where it went.
- Yeah.

40:36.001 --> 40:39.068
I, uh...

40:39.070 --> 40:40.637
I bumped into your desk,

40:40.639 --> 40:42.439
And it accidentally fell
into my pocket.

40:42.441 --> 40:44.107
And then by the time
I got to the parking lot,

40:44.109 --> 40:46.042
I didn't have time to...

40:46.044 --> 40:48.978
To come back in, so...
- [laughs]

40:48.980 --> 40:51.080
- Here I am.

40:53.517 --> 40:56.886
- This might be one of the worst
excuses a guy has ever used

40:56.888 --> 40:58.655
To try
to get into my apartment.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.991
- Here I was expecting
a thank you.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.961
- Thank you.

41:16.474 --> 41:19.642
I have to work so early
in the morning.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.812
- Yeah.
Yeah, sure.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.550
I'll see you around.

41:30.020 --> 41:33.122
- Okay.

41:33.124 --> 41:37.193
But, I mean,
you did come all this way and...

41:37.195 --> 41:40.797
- Yeah.
- So maybe just...One more.

41:48.506 --> 41:51.107
- Oh, damn.

41:51.109 --> 41:53.943
- [laughs]

41:53.945 --> 41:56.012
[whispering]
good night.

41:58.015 --> 41:59.616
Go.
