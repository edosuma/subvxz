about one of your officers, sir.

26:02.240 --> 26:03.970
Uh-huh.

Mr. Caraway.

26:06.311 --> 26:09.210
Well, go on then.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.909
He's no good... sir.

26:13.952 --> 26:16.751
Gonna need more than that.

26:17.422 --> 26:19.454
No good, how?

26:19.524 --> 26:22.050
It's how he treats his daughter.

26:23.962 --> 26:27.788
I understand the two of you
have become pretty close, am I correct?

26:29.067 --> 26:30.165
Yes, sir.

26:30.235 --> 26:33.802
And this complaint of yours, it wouldn't have
anything to do with a potential complaint...

26:33.872 --> 26:35.534
of his about you spending all day
and night with her would it?

26:35.774 --> 26:37.072
No.

26:37.142 --> 26:39.475
But he has made such an objection?

26:43.314 --> 26:44.179
Hm.

26:48.453 --> 26:49.978
I saw him beat her.

26:52.991 --> 26:56.424
And he went on afterward
to drown me half to death.

26:56.494 --> 27:00.495
Well, that doesn't sound quite right.

27:00.565 --> 27:03.998
But what puzzles me about this, you see...

27:04.068 --> 27:07.502
is that kids are a product of their parents.

27:07.572 --> 27:09.471

27:09.541 --> 27:13.274

29:19.404 --> 29:21.135

29:21.205 --> 29:24.539
and I'm sorry to say
that not either of 'em...

29:24.609 --> 29:28.409
involves you having a friendship
with my baby girl.

All right.

51:03.873 --> 51:06.001
I lost count twice...

51:06.243 --> 51:11.511
but, I think I got around
four hundred and thirty thousand.

51:11.581 --> 51:14.881
I've got about five hundred
and fifty thousand.

51:14.951 --> 51:16.010

51:16.253 --> 51:18.485
nine hundred and eighty, total.

51:18.555 --> 51:20.387
It's almost a million dollars.

51:22.025 --> 51:24.724
- Do you know what that means?
- It means we're rich.

No, Jonas, this is not our money.

he stole from them...

56:15.151 --> 56:18.246
He wasn't too concerned with beating her up.

57:48.311 --> 57:51.008
they made sure nothing bad
would happen to him.

57:55.318 --> 57:58.720
And then after that, I guess...

I guess I was the only one
around to get angry at.

he wouldn't lose control again.

Casey, why would you do that?

01:13:12.350 --> 01:13:14.116
Because it scares me.

01:13:14.186 --> 01:13:17.219
It scares me more to think about
what we're suppose to do without it.

01:13:17.289 --> 01:13:19.321
Okay, that gun keeps us safe and you know it.

01:13:19.391 --> 01:13:20.989
I don't want to be those kind of people.

01:13:21.059 --> 01:13:22.390

01:13:22.460 --> 01:13:25.961
The kind that sticks a gun in someone's
face to get what they want.

01:13:26.031 --> 01:13:27.395
Well, I don't want to be those
kind of people, either, Casey...

01:13:27.465 --> 01:13:30.165
but we have to be realistic about this.

01:13:30.235 --> 01:13:34.136
It's only a matter of time before someone
sees us with Blaise and puts it together.

01:13:34.206 --> 01:13:39.074
He's gonna get us caught again and when
he does we need to be ready for it.

01:15:46.304 --> 01:15:49.270
There wasn't time for that, Casey!
I had to get you out of that house!

just leave me right where I was?

Huh? Why'd you even come?

01:16:03.354 --> 01:16:05.721

01:31:21.521 --> 01:31:24.221
Casey, what are you doing?

01:31:24.291 --> 01:31:26.419
Casey... please.

01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:32.029
Casey, please! Casey!

01:31:32.266 --> 01:31:34.464
- Come on now, baby girl.
- Casey, please don't.

01:31:34.534 --> 01:31:35.732
- Let's get this done.
- Casey!

01:31:35.802 --> 01:31:38.328
Casey! Casey!

01:31:39.673 --> 01:31:41.437
Casey!

01:31:42.042 --> 01:31:43.670
Casey!

01:31:49.983 --> 01:31:53.681
All you had to do was mind your own business.

01:32:00.994 --> 01:32:02.326
Let's go.

01:32:07.067 --> 01:32:10.697
Casey! Casey!

01:32:11.772 --> 01:32:15.709
Casey! Casey!

01:32:17.377 --> 01:32:18.845
Casey!

01:32:47.040 --> 01:32:48.705
It's under here somewhere.

01:32:48.775 --> 01:32:50.869
What are you waiting for, then?

01:32:53.547 --> 01:32:56.346
I'll try that one.

01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:44.925
No use stallin'.

01:33:47.901 --> 01:33:49.130
Hey!

01:33:50.904 --> 01:33:52.569
Whoa! Baby girl.

01:33:52.639 --> 01:33:54.905
I'll kill you before I let you kill him.

01:33:54.975 --> 01:33:57.035
Nobody's killin' anybody.

01:33:58.845 --> 01:34:01.011
Put the gun down, Casey and we'll talk.

01:34:01.081 --> 01:34:02.746
You shut up!

01:34:02.816 --> 01:34:05.716
Casey, you're scaring me.

01:34:05.786 --> 01:34:10.620
Okay, I admit it... I know I failed you.

01:34:10.690 --> 01:34:13.824
I lost my heart, I lost my way.

01:34:13.894 --> 01:34:16.526
But I swear on my soul,
on your mama's grave...

01:34:16.596 --> 01:34:20.497
- I'll let him go.
- I don't believe you.

01:34:20.567 --> 01:34:23.734
You know what happens
if you pull that trigger, don't you?

01:34:23.804 --> 01:34:27.604
You'll be alone.
I know you're with Jonas now.

01:34:27.674 --> 01:34:31.508
Pretty soon he's gonna get tired
and he's gonna wanna go home.

01:34:31.578 --> 01:34:35.011
You'll see... one day he'll quit
on you, quick as light.

01:34:35.081 --> 01:34:37.748
It's coming, I guarantee it.

01:34:37.818 --> 01:34:39.583
Casey, you're my angel.

01:34:39.653 --> 01:34:42.919
Baby girl, please.

01:34:42.989 --> 01:34:45.185
It's you and me, right?

01:34:46.693 --> 01:34:47.991
Say it.

01:34:48.061 --> 01:34:49.859
Shut up.

01:34:51.614 --> 01:34:53.143
It's you and...

01:34:56.536 --> 01:34:58.635
