00:02.244 --> 00:03.844
Hey, Leonard, if you're
not busy tomorrow,

00:03.846 --> 00:06.246
I have to do a little
reception after work.

00:06.248 --> 00:09.082
Oh, I would, but we need to make
a push on the air force project.

00:09.084 --> 00:10.317
Oh, are you sure?

00:10.319 --> 00:12.119
We're celebrating
our new A.D.D. drug,

00:12.121 --> 00:14.888
and it'll probably be over
in, like, six minutes.

00:16.024 --> 00:17.224
Did you say you guys
are working on

00:17.226 --> 00:19.393
the guidance system tomorrow?
Yeah, why?

00:19.395 --> 00:21.195
Well, Sheldon said that
he was gonna work with me

00:21.197 --> 00:22.796
on our quantum
perception project.

00:22.798 --> 00:24.898
We've had this planned
for a week.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.867
Well, he reconfirmed
with me this morning.

00:26.869 --> 00:28.669
Guys, before this
gets ugly, remember,

00:28.671 --> 00:30.637
the winner gets Sheldon.

00:31.974 --> 00:34.074
Hey, Raj, do you want
to go with me tomorrow?

00:34.076 --> 00:36.577
Are you asking because you
want me there or out of pity?

00:36.579 --> 00:38.111
Actually, never mind,
don't answer.

00:38.113 --> 00:39.279
I'd love to.

00:41.116 --> 00:42.983
Hello.

00:42.985 --> 00:44.318
Why did you tell Leonard
you're working on

00:44.320 --> 00:46.253
the gyroscope tomorrow?
Because I am.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.698
But you said you were
working with me.

00:47.722 --> 00:48.556
PENNY: Uh-oh.

00:48.557 --> 00:52.626
Someone's got two dates
to the nerd prom.

00:53.295 --> 00:54.294
I have a plan

00:54.296 --> 00:56.830
to work on both
projects simultaneously.

00:56.832 --> 00:59.466
And for your information,
the summer conference

00:59.468 --> 01:02.636
on algebraic topology
at Caltech is nerd prom.

01:04.039 --> 01:05.873
I'm sorry, what is
this plan you have?

01:05.875 --> 01:08.742
Well, I'm not needed at
both places at the same time.

01:08.744 --> 01:11.712
And I can also free up extra
hours with simple tricks,

01:11.714 --> 01:14.815
such as using a minimal amount
of words to convey my point.

01:14.817 --> 01:17.184
When does
that start?

01:18.287 --> 01:19.353
Soon.

01:19.355 --> 01:20.721
See, I could've said

01:20.723 --> 01:22.456
"in the near future," but I
didn't say "in the near future,"

01:22.458 --> 01:25.525
'cause "in the near future" is
three more words than "soon."

01:25.527 --> 01:28.328
"In" one, "the" two, "near"
three, "future" four.

01:28.330 --> 01:30.264
See "in the near future"
is four, "soon" is just one,

01:30.266 --> 01:33.233
four is more than one;
saving time already.

01:34.637 --> 01:35.936
Genius.

01:35.938 --> 01:37.137
I was gonna say,

01:37.139 --> 01:39.606
"Why does anyone think
Sheldon's a genius?"

01:39.608 --> 01:41.608
But I didn't.

02:12.110 --> 02:15.411
Gentlemen, I've got
Amy up and running.

02:15.413 --> 02:16.546
Shall we get to work?

02:16.548 --> 02:19.215
Uh, before we do,
what are you wearing,

02:19.217 --> 02:22.051
oh, friend who
we pretend is normal?

02:22.053 --> 02:24.754
These are hydration backpacks.

02:24.756 --> 02:27.157
Eh, for efficiency,
whenever I'm thirsty,

02:27.159 --> 02:28.625
I have access to water.

02:28.627 --> 02:31.494
Eh, when I'm hungry,
I have lentil soup.

02:33.298 --> 02:35.265
It's getting harder to pretend.

02:35.267 --> 02:37.367
Anyway, Sheldon, we're
at a decision point

02:37.369 --> 02:39.235
to run the xenon stream
through the cryocooler

02:39.237 --> 02:40.904
or through the
vacuum filter.

02:40.906 --> 02:42.806
Run down the pros and cons
of each for me.

02:42.808 --> 02:44.908
Well, if we run the xenon stream
through the cryocooler,

02:44.910 --> 02:45.875
it'll be cooled immediately

02:45.877 --> 02:47.510
before it reacts
with the conduction.

02:47.512 --> 02:48.945
(slurping)

02:51.750 --> 02:55.318
Oh, sorry, uh, carrot chunk.

02:56.454 --> 02:59.155
You can just feel
the time being saved.

03:01.126 --> 03:04.427
Ah, I'm back, you got me
for eight minutes.

03:04.429 --> 03:05.461
Sheldon,
this is silly.

03:05.463 --> 03:07.030
You can't expect us
to do quality work

03:07.032 --> 03:09.833
with you popping
in and out like this.

03:09.835 --> 03:11.467
The coefficient isn't lambda,
it's lambda sub one.

03:11.469 --> 03:12.502
And over here,

03:12.504 --> 03:13.903
you should consider
the possibility

03:13.905 --> 03:16.673
that the brain itself is in
two different quantum states.

03:16.675 --> 03:19.542
And lastly, do you have
any little soup crackers?

03:20.612 --> 03:22.946
The rate of spinning for
the central axis centrifuge

03:22.948 --> 03:25.248
has to be four
revolutions per second.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.684
It can't be four revolutions,
it's got to be seven.

03:27.686 --> 03:28.551
Seven?!

03:28.553 --> 03:30.053
Look at the board,
it's four.

03:30.055 --> 03:31.087
Oh, my God, it's seven!

03:31.089 --> 03:32.155
Four!
Seven!

03:32.157 --> 03:33.456
It's five and a half.

03:34.359 --> 03:36.259
Son of a bitch,
it's five and a half.

03:37.395 --> 03:39.929
B.R.B., that's short
for "Be right back."

03:39.931 --> 03:41.931
I'm saving so much time!

03:43.201 --> 03:45.535
The two signals meet up
in the corpus callosum

03:45.537 --> 03:48.171
and T equals zero.

03:48.173 --> 03:51.574
And I know a boy who just
earned a slurp of soup.

03:51.576 --> 03:53.142
Incredible.

03:53.144 --> 03:56.212
Sheldon, I didn't expect that
you could work on both projects,

03:56.214 --> 03:58.514
but I, I was wrong.

03:58.516 --> 04:00.250
You know, I felt the same way
about the spork.

04:00.252 --> 04:02.552
Uh, solids and liquids
handled by one utensil?

04:02.554 --> 04:04.153
That'll never work.

04:04.155 --> 04:05.655
Spoiler: works.

04:06.858 --> 04:08.224
I got to admit,

04:08.226 --> 04:10.159
we didn't think you'd be able
to do two things at once.

04:10.161 --> 04:13.096
Yeah, I felt the same way
about the platypus.

04:13.098 --> 04:14.530
You know,
bird and mammal

04:14.532 --> 04:16.065
in the same creature? No way.

04:16.067 --> 04:19.035
And spoiler: way.

04:21.172 --> 04:23.039
Hey.
Hey.

04:23.041 --> 04:26.075
Oh, thanks again for letting
me use your laptop last night.

04:26.077 --> 04:27.377
No problem.

04:27.379 --> 04:29.012
Was just doing my taxes.

04:29.014 --> 04:30.213
Okay.

04:30.215 --> 04:31.648
Actually, if
I could...

04:31.650 --> 04:33.116
if I could just
check one more...

04:33.118 --> 04:34.284
Already cleared
the browser history.

04:34.286 --> 04:35.985
You're a good woman.

04:37.188 --> 04:38.721
What you working on?

04:38.723 --> 04:41.524
Trying to catch up on office
e-mails before I go back.

04:41.526 --> 04:44.928
Oh, that's right,
maternity leave's almost over.

04:44.930 --> 04:46.229
Ah, you excited?

04:46.231 --> 04:49.632
Yeah, I mean, I'll miss Halley,

04:49.634 --> 04:51.801
but it'll be nice
to get out of the house,

04:51.803 --> 04:53.736
be intellectually
stimulated.

04:53.738 --> 04:58.441
Go out to lunch instead of,
you know, be lunch.

04:59.311 --> 05:00.777
That's great, good for you.

05:00.779 --> 05:05.315
Yeah, I mean, with you and my
parents, she's gonna be fine.

05:05.317 --> 05:06.582
Ah, of course
she is.

05:06.584 --> 05:08.217
And that day care is great.

05:08.219 --> 05:09.852
It is. I went to check it out,

05:09.854 --> 05:12.755
and they are very cautious about
letting strange men with no kids

05:12.757 --> 05:15.458
peek in the windows.

05:17.295 --> 05:20.596
Plus, I, I think I'm setting
a good example for Halley,

05:20.598 --> 05:22.332
to show her that
women can be mothers

05:22.334 --> 05:24.968
and still have
satisfying careers.

05:24.970 --> 05:27.870
Sure, she won't know where I
went or if I'm ever coming back.

05:27.872 --> 05:29.973
That'll just make the ten
minutes between when I get home

05:29.975 --> 05:32.842
(voice breaking): and her
bedtime even more special.

05:33.812 --> 05:37.146
Uh, other than burp you
or give you a bottle,

05:37.148 --> 05:39.482
I don't know
what to do right now.

05:39.484 --> 05:43.386
It's okay, I'm just being
emotional about this.

05:43.388 --> 05:45.355
Can you not tell Howard?

05:45.357 --> 05:47.824
Well, don't you think
it'd be healthier

05:47.826 --> 05:49.826
if you told him what's
going on with you?

05:49.828 --> 05:51.127
Don't you think
it'd be healthier

05:51.129 --> 05:54.130
if you had your own apartment,
grown man?

05:55.633 --> 05:58.034
Your secret is safe with me.

06:01.606 --> 06:04.440
Hey, since when do you do
laundry on a Thursday?

06:04.442 --> 06:06.943
Oh, I had an
accident at work,

06:06.945 --> 06:10.279
I slipped and fell
on my soup sack.

06:10.281 --> 06:14.183
You know, there was a time I
would say "What's a soup sack?"

06:14.185 --> 06:17.353
But... I'm glad we're past that.

06:19.024 --> 06:20.323
(sneezes)

06:20.325 --> 06:22.725
You know, there was a time
I would say "God bless you,"

06:22.727 --> 06:25.261
and then you would say "If you
must invoke an imaginary deity,

06:25.263 --> 06:26.396
how about Thor?"

06:26.398 --> 06:28.231
And I would say,

06:28.233 --> 06:29.899
"How do you know
I didn't mean Thor?"

06:29.901 --> 06:31.167
And then you would say "Touché,"

06:31.169 --> 06:32.368
and that there ends the tale

06:32.370 --> 06:35.171
of why I no longer say
"God bless you."

06:36.608 --> 06:38.508
Well, we have had some fun,
haven't we?

06:38.510 --> 06:39.709
Oh, yeah.

06:40.612 --> 06:42.412
So, Leonard tells me
you've had a busy day.

06:42.414 --> 06:43.813
Hmm? Oh, I did.

06:43.815 --> 06:45.048
It hasn't stopped.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.383
I figured out a solution
for our navigation system

06:47.385 --> 06:50.653
while I was pre-soaking lentils
out of my pants.

06:50.655 --> 06:51.654
(sneezes)

06:51.656 --> 06:53.122
Are you getting sick?

06:53.124 --> 06:54.323
Of course not.

06:54.325 --> 06:55.525
I'm too busy to be sick.

06:55.527 --> 06:56.859
Well, you're
pretty delicate.

06:56.861 --> 06:58.761
Maybe you shouldn't be
pushing yourself so hard.

06:58.763 --> 07:00.363
I'm fine.
All right.

07:00.365 --> 07:02.265
Well, we'll just pretend
that you didn't catch a cold

07:02.267 --> 07:04.233
watching <i>Frozen.</i>
I...

07:04.235 --> 07:05.701
That didn't happen.

07:05.703 --> 07:07.403
You also got a nosebleed
watching <i>Up.</i>

07:07.405 --> 07:08.738
Just do your laundry!

07:12.877 --> 07:14.644
Stuart, you didn't
have to make dinner.

07:14.646 --> 07:17.680
Yeah, well, I felt bad about
upsetting you this morning.

07:17.682 --> 07:21.751
And to be honest, I'm not the
biggest fan of your meatloaf.

07:23.588 --> 07:24.954
Hey, what's for dinner?

07:24.956 --> 07:25.955
Meatloaf.

07:25.957 --> 07:27.256
Oh, cool.

07:27.258 --> 07:28.391
Stuart made it.

07:28.393 --> 07:30.259
Oh, cool.

07:31.629 --> 07:33.129
Hey, I was thinking

07:33.131 --> 07:35.631
maybe we take Halley
to the zoo this weekend,

07:35.633 --> 07:37.100
get in a little
family time

07:37.102 --> 07:38.601
before you go
back to work.

07:38.603 --> 07:39.936
Sounds great.

07:39.938 --> 07:41.137
WOLOWITZ:
Speaking of which,

07:41.139 --> 07:42.839
for day care,
it'll be easy for me

07:42.841 --> 07:45.741
to drop her off, unless
you want to do it.

07:45.743 --> 07:47.777
Hmm, guess it should be me.

07:47.779 --> 07:48.911
STUART:
I can't do it;

07:48.913 --> 07:52.782
they have a picture of me
on file now.

07:57.655 --> 07:58.654
You okay?

07:58.656 --> 08:00.223
Of course, why?

08:00.225 --> 08:02.592
Well, I don't know,
you seem a little upset.

08:02.594 --> 08:04.894
No, I'm fine.
You sure?

08:04.896 --> 08:05.995
Why don't you
think she's fine?

08:05.997 --> 08:08.231
She sounds fine,
she looks fine.

08:08.233 --> 08:11.000
If I saw her on the street I'd
say, "Damn, that girl's fine!"

08:15.607 --> 08:17.840
Sheldon, you're sick,
go back to bed.

08:17.842 --> 08:20.243
(stuffy):
I am fine.

08:20.245 --> 08:21.911
Here, eat your toast.

08:21.913 --> 08:24.113
(sneezes)

08:26.885 --> 08:28.584
Sorry.

08:29.621 --> 08:31.654
It's okay,
now I don't need butter.

08:33.525 --> 08:36.826
Well, perhaps I am
a little under the weather.

08:36.828 --> 08:39.195
It's nothing a little
cold medicine and tea can't fix.

08:39.197 --> 08:40.796
You need sleep.

08:40.798 --> 08:42.899
What I need is
to get to work.

08:42.900 --> 08:44.901
Well, I don't want
your germs around me.

08:44.903 --> 08:47.503
What? You hold my hand,
you kiss my mouth,

08:47.505 --> 08:50.239
but you draw the line
at 102 fever?

08:51.142 --> 08:52.675
What happened to our love?

08:57.348 --> 08:59.115
Sheldon, are you okay?

09:01.819 --> 09:03.386
What's going on?

09:04.289 --> 09:05.821
How'd I get here?

09:05.823 --> 09:09.091
I don't know, we came home
from work and we found you.

09:09.093 --> 09:11.861
Home from work?

09:11.863 --> 09:12.962
What time is it?

09:12.964 --> 09:13.930
It's 9:00.

09:13.932 --> 09:15.698
9:00?!

09:15.700 --> 09:17.366
W-What happened
to 8:00 and 7:00

09:17.368 --> 09:19.202
and all the other o'clocks?

09:19.204 --> 09:21.404
Wait, you don't remember?

09:21.406 --> 09:24.740
Well, I remember waking up
in the morning,

09:24.742 --> 09:27.944
Amy rubbing Vicks on my chest.

09:27.946 --> 09:31.380
And her hands were like
two frozen chunks of tundra.

09:33.251 --> 09:36.485
I took some cold medicine to...
(gasps)

09:36.487 --> 09:38.254
I took cold medicine.

09:39.357 --> 09:40.556
You did seem a little loopy

09:40.558 --> 09:41.891
when you showed up at the lab.

09:41.893 --> 09:43.793
At-- at the lab?!

09:45.363 --> 09:47.930
Why am I naked
from the waist down?

09:50.702 --> 09:52.001
I don't know
where your pants are,

09:52.003 --> 09:54.470
but we did find your underwear
in a pot on the stove.

09:56.000 --> 10:02.074

10:04.168 --> 10:07.570
My pants are missing,
I don't remember anything.

10:07.572 --> 10:11.307
Penny, this is your youth.
What do I do?

10:11.309 --> 10:13.609
I don't know,

10:13.611 --> 10:16.245
check your body for tattoos?

10:17.415 --> 10:19.281
Leonard,
would you be a lamb...

10:19.283 --> 10:20.816
She's kidding!

10:23.020 --> 10:26.122
Wait, wait. Where's my bag?
My phone and my wallet

10:26.124 --> 10:27.556
are in my bag.
It's right here.

10:27.558 --> 10:29.191
(gasps)

10:29.193 --> 10:31.393
(sighs)

10:31.395 --> 10:34.230
Where's my notebook?
My notebook's gone. Oh, no.

10:34.232 --> 10:36.198
Okay, it's just a notebook,
what's the big deal?

10:36.200 --> 10:37.633
What's the big deal?

10:37.635 --> 10:38.834
It's full of
classified information

10:38.836 --> 10:40.169
about the air force project!

10:40.171 --> 10:41.670
How could you lose that?

10:42.874 --> 10:44.273
It's okay,
I'm sure we'll find it.

10:44.275 --> 10:46.108
Look, it's got to be
around here somewhere.

10:46.110 --> 10:48.778
Maybe it's wherever
your pants are.

10:50.515 --> 10:53.549
Nope, pants in the microwave,
no notebook.

10:55.787 --> 10:57.920
Hey.

10:57.922 --> 10:59.789
Ah, hello.

10:59.791 --> 11:01.857
(sighs) Look, something's
going on with Bernadette.

11:01.859 --> 11:03.025
She say anything to you?

11:03.027 --> 11:05.361
Well, nope,
not a word.

11:05.363 --> 11:06.662
Come on, be honest.

11:06.664 --> 11:09.765
Did you tell her
I tried her breast pump?

11:15.039 --> 11:18.874
No, but I did mention it
to my therapist.

11:21.779 --> 11:24.480
Well, I know she's mad
at me about something.

11:24.482 --> 11:26.916
Well, what have you done
that would upset her?

11:26.918 --> 11:30.519
Oh, gosh,
how much time do you have?

11:30.521 --> 11:31.921
(sighs)

11:31.923 --> 11:34.590
Well, why don't you just
start with the worst thing?

11:34.592 --> 11:36.792
Hmm, let's see. Mm.

11:36.794 --> 11:39.295
Okay, here we go: six years ago,

11:39.297 --> 11:45.234
I got a call that Bernie's
great-aunt, Trixie, died.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.435
And?

11:46.437 --> 11:50.673
(whispering): And I forgot
to give her the message.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.142
That's terrible.

11:53.144 --> 11:54.977
The terrible part is,
ever since then,

11:54.979 --> 11:56.645
I've been
sending Bernie

11:56.647 --> 11:59.515
(laughing):
Christmas cards from Trixie.

11:59.517 --> 12:02.251
Oh...

12:02.253 --> 12:03.452
Howard!

12:03.454 --> 12:05.287
Let me finish-- and one card
had five dollars in it

12:05.289 --> 12:06.622
I took from Bernie's purse.

12:10.061 --> 12:12.127
The notebook isn't
in the bathroom.

12:12.129 --> 12:13.596
I can't find it,
either.

12:13.598 --> 12:15.097
How can he not remember a day?

12:15.099 --> 12:18.100
Well, people who are abducted
by aliens lose time.

12:18.102 --> 12:21.070
I mean, maybe it happens
to the aliens, too.

12:21.072 --> 12:22.471
(door opens)

12:22.473 --> 12:25.307
Well, it's not
across the hall.

12:25.309 --> 12:28.644
That's it. I'm in breach
of my security clearance.

12:28.646 --> 12:30.079
I'm going to prison.

12:30.081 --> 12:32.615
And you know what happens
to people like me in prison.

12:33.951 --> 12:38.153
I'll be forced to be
some large man's tutor.

12:40.124 --> 12:42.558
You're not going to prison.

12:42.560 --> 12:44.627
But, boy, it is funny
to think about.

12:44.629 --> 12:46.228
(chuckles)

12:46.230 --> 12:48.597
You really can't remember
anything?

12:48.599 --> 12:49.598
I'm trying.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.201
Wait a minute.
Hey, let me see your phone.

12:52.203 --> 12:53.702
Why?

12:53.704 --> 12:54.837
Well, it's--
it's possible

12:54.839 --> 12:56.639
it was tracking
everywhere you went.

12:56.641 --> 12:58.040
Phones can do that?

12:58.042 --> 13:00.276
Yeah, it depends
on the privacy settings.

13:00.278 --> 13:01.377
Oh, tha-- that's so cool.

13:01.379 --> 13:05.414
How do you--
how do you turn that thing off?

13:05.416 --> 13:06.916
Relax.

13:06.918 --> 13:09.685
I know when you "go for a run,"
you stop for a donut.

13:09.687 --> 13:12.655
I don't even run there, I drive.

13:15.660 --> 13:17.927
Hang on, I can see
every place you went.

13:17.929 --> 13:18.928
What does it say?

13:18.930 --> 13:21.630
Uh, you were in the building,

13:21.632 --> 13:23.432
you were
at the university,

13:23.434 --> 13:26.068
then you were somewhere
on Colorado Boulevard.

13:26.070 --> 13:28.003
Where?

13:28.005 --> 13:30.272
Wait, hang on.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.174
Did you go to a cowboy bar?

13:32.176 --> 13:34.310
I-- no!

13:34.312 --> 13:36.845
That is preposterous.

13:38.516 --> 13:40.783
Ow!
(country music playing)

13:45.189 --> 13:46.722
Maybe.

13:50.328 --> 13:52.795
Hey, how's it going?

13:52.797 --> 13:53.963
Fine.

13:53.965 --> 13:57.166
Good. Love you.

13:57.168 --> 13:58.901
Love you, too.
Love you more. (chuckles)

13:58.903 --> 14:02.304
Okay, you won.
Can I finish what I'm doing?

14:02.306 --> 14:05.674
Sure, sorry.
(chuckles)

14:05.676 --> 14:07.910
(humming)

14:09.613 --> 14:11.246
Something on your mind?

14:11.248 --> 14:13.048
No, no, nothing.
(chuckles)

14:13.050 --> 14:15.584
Okay, well,
maybe I'm just feeling like

14:15.586 --> 14:17.519
something's bothering you.

14:17.521 --> 14:19.221
Nope, all good.

14:19.223 --> 14:23.659
Prove it, make love to me
right now on the kitchen floor.

14:23.661 --> 14:26.195
No, what is wrong with you?

14:26.197 --> 14:27.596
Aha, you are upset.

14:27.598 --> 14:32.401
I don't know a lot about women,
but I know I upset them.

14:32.403 --> 14:35.337
Howard, I'm sorry
if I'm being weird,

14:35.339 --> 14:37.272
but it has nothing
to do with you.

14:37.274 --> 14:38.374
It doesn't?

14:38.376 --> 14:40.676
No.
(sighs)

14:40.678 --> 14:42.878
I didn't want
to tell you, but...

14:42.880 --> 14:46.181
I'm having a really tough time
about going back to work.

14:46.183 --> 14:48.884
Oh. Okay, well, I get that.

14:48.886 --> 14:51.487
It was hard for me
when I went back.

14:51.489 --> 14:52.855
It was?
Of course.

14:52.857 --> 14:55.124
I missed you
and the baby

14:55.126 --> 14:58.660
and being able to watch <i>Ellen</i>
every day.

14:58.662 --> 15:02.264
I just don't know
what the right thing to do is.

15:02.266 --> 15:05.034
If I go back to work,
I'm abandoning Halley.

15:05.036 --> 15:06.435
If I don't go,

15:06.437 --> 15:08.504
I'm giving up
everything I worked for.

15:08.506 --> 15:10.873
It's like
there's no right choice.

15:10.875 --> 15:14.076
Look, I don't know what
the best decision is, either.

15:15.613 --> 15:18.447
But whatever we choose,
if we're not happy,

15:18.449 --> 15:20.616
we can undo it.

15:20.618 --> 15:22.051
I guess.

15:22.053 --> 15:23.819
And the best part is:
Halley won't remember a thing.

15:23.821 --> 15:25.120
(laughs)

15:25.122 --> 15:28.123
Babies are cute,
but they're dumb.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.124
(chuckles)
I mean,

15:29.126 --> 15:30.526
I-I go like this,

15:30.528 --> 15:32.688
she thinks I'm gone. Then
magically I'm back. I mean...

15:34.165 --> 15:37.099
Honestly,
why are we saving for college?

15:38.903 --> 15:41.770
I'm not crazy about
you calling our baby dumb.

15:41.772 --> 15:44.406
Well, she gets it from me.

15:44.408 --> 15:45.574
Speaking of which,

15:45.576 --> 15:48.444
I have some news

No, but Sheldon told me

16:44.368 --> 16:45.901
He told everybody.

16:47.771 --> 16:49.037
That's just great.

16:49.039 --> 16:50.205
Oh, don't worry,
