My brother's DNA turned up
at your mum's murder scene.

00:03.790 --> 00:05.430
Alexa, do you know who did it?

00:05.590 --> 00:07.830
<i>This businessman
my mum used to work for.</i>

00:07.990 --> 00:09.030
Help!

00:09.190 --> 00:12.030
<i>I told Slade everything
and he went to help Dad.</i>

00:12.190 --> 00:14.430
<i>Slade went to the Old Town Hotel?</i>

00:15.470 --> 00:17.430
I'm calling the... police.

00:17.590 --> 00:19.550
Slade, you killed someone.

00:19.710 --> 00:22.510
Give me the codes!

00:22.670 --> 00:24.590
Now!

00:24.750 --> 00:27.950
I'm a solicitor. When you get
to the police station, call me.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.630
<i>You knew where he was all along.</i>

00:29.790 --> 00:30.830
You knew about the whole thing.

00:30.990 --> 00:33.190
You were so destructive,

00:33.350 --> 00:35.550
<i>smashing things with that bat.</i>

00:35.710 --> 00:39.030
Where'd you go after you'd run out?

00:39.190 --> 00:42.030
<i>They've found Jesse's DNA
at Newman's crime scene.</i>

00:42.190 --> 00:44.750
- Maybe Jesse killed Newman.
- That's impossible,

00:44.910 --> 00:46.630
because I killed Newman.

01:31.310 --> 01:33.350
- Alan.
- Mm-hm?

01:33.510 --> 01:36.150
- There's someone in the house.
- No, there isn't. Shut up.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.590
No, no, no, no.

02:03.110 --> 02:04.110
Hello?

02:05.030 --> 02:06.350
Hey!

02:13.550 --> 02:14.870
Shit!

02:25.590 --> 02:27.670
Alan? Oh, jeez!

02:30.110 --> 02:31.830
Ow! You bastard!

02:32.590 --> 02:34.430
What have you done?

02:38.790 --> 02:41.230
They went into Jesse's room too.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.910
It was him, wasn't it?

02:45.630 --> 02:47.390
Jesse?

02:48.910 --> 02:50.830
Oh, it's glass.

02:50.990 --> 02:53.710
Open your mouth. Open your mouth.

02:54.750 --> 02:57.350
Open. Open wide. Don't bite.

02:59.750 --> 03:02.430
How could he bite through
the glass?

03:07.670 --> 03:10.070
Al? Are you OK?

03:13.870 --> 03:15.950
I'll get you some tissue.

03:22.630 --> 03:25.150
Did you set out to kill
this Newman guy?

03:25.310 --> 03:27.990
Slade, come on!

03:28.150 --> 03:30.790
You can't just tell me you killed
two people and leave it at that.

03:34.030 --> 03:37.070
This... This first guy,
this Dempsey guy, I understand.

03:37.230 --> 03:38.750
It's him or Kenton.

03:38.910 --> 03:42.630
I can understand that
but, with Newman...

03:43.270 --> 03:46.630
This Newman destroyed girls' lives.

03:48.030 --> 03:49.590
One of those girls was Britnay.

03:49.750 --> 03:52.030
- OK...
- No, no, no, just, please, shut up.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.310
OK, you asked. Now you listen.

03:54.470 --> 03:56.870
- <i>Sorry, I can't...</i>
- <i>Brit!</i>

04:06.230 --> 04:08.190
Just let me die!

04:09.430 --> 04:11.590
Stop it! No!

04:11.750 --> 04:14.270
Come on. Eat your breakfast. Eat!

04:14.430 --> 04:15.390
Stop it!

04:19.870 --> 04:21.550
What are you doing here?

04:31.710 --> 04:33.710
But it was self-defence, right?

04:41.110 --> 04:45.310
What does that mean?
So you would've killed him anyway?

04:45.870 --> 04:48.870
<i>If he'd lived, he would've
implicated Britnay.</i>

04:50.870 --> 04:52.350
I had two choices.

04:52.510 --> 04:56.790
Kill that monster or let him
destroy her all over again.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.510
It was an easy choice.

05:03.070 --> 05:07.950
<i>Help. Please.
I'm at 3 Manville Avenue. Help.</i>

05:14.470 --> 05:17.830
This Newman,
he could've told us about Jesse.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.990
I didn't know that, did I, Mark?
At the time, I didn't know...

05:21.150 --> 05:23.510
Maybe you shouldn't go around
killing people, then.

05:23.670 --> 05:26.830
- I was protecting Britnay.
- Yeah, well, it didn't work.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.070
Did it, Slade?

05:36.230 --> 05:38.990
Mum?

05:39.150 --> 05:40.670
Danny's here.

05:41.590 --> 05:44.470
- Mum. Mum, Mum, Mum.
- Oh, Mark.

05:45.710 --> 05:47.990
This is a personal thing.
I'm asking for a favour.

05:48.150 --> 05:51.310
- Hi, Slade.
- Are you all right, Dad?

05:51.470 --> 05:55.630
- Yeah. Cut my foot. It's all right.
- So... is it definite? Was it him?

05:55.790 --> 05:57.670
Well, your dad saw him.
I only heard him.

05:57.830 --> 06:00.110
Excuse me. No, I saw
someone running into the park.

06:00.270 --> 06:02.150
I couldn't see his face.
He was in a hoodie.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.950
He was in Jesse's room,
looking through family photos.

06:05.110 --> 06:07.910
- We think. We're not sure.
- Some of the photos are missing.

06:08.070 --> 06:10.830
You said he had a backpack
he could've put them in.

06:10.990 --> 06:12.630
Thank you.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.750
Look, CSI can't be here
till the morning. Erm...

06:15.910 --> 06:17.950
Julie can stay
with you and your dad till then?

06:18.110 --> 06:20.030
- Yeah, of course.
- Listen, I've got to go.

06:20.190 --> 06:22.470
- You'll call me?
- Yeah. Thanks, Danny.

06:22.630 --> 06:24.830
- Thanks, Danny.
- Night, mate.

06:25.350 --> 06:28.470
Danny, what do you reckon?
Jesse or not Jesse?

06:31.030 --> 06:32.470
Your guess.

06:33.710 --> 06:35.710
OK. See you.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.630
- Hey. Oh, yes! Yes!
- Keep your voice down.

06:57.790 --> 06:59.790
Shut the door.
I don't wanna wake the kids up.

07:00.910 --> 07:04.430
- Where have you been?
- Oh, yeah, Julie called.

07:04.590 --> 07:08.030
- They had a break-in.
- And who is looking after our kids?

07:08.190 --> 07:09.790
No, no, look, I left some notes.

07:09.950 --> 07:12.350
I left them loads of notes
saying I'd be back. One each.

07:12.510 --> 07:15.390
And then you just left them...
with Ray?

07:15.550 --> 07:17.350
That's super-safe, isn't it?

07:17.510 --> 07:19.270
They're asleep.

07:19.430 --> 07:21.310
What if something happened?

07:24.430 --> 07:27.150
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.
It was a one-off, OK.

07:27.310 --> 07:30.190
Um... It was wrong.
Course it's wrong. OK. I'm sorry.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.150
I'm really sorry. Let's go upstairs
and wake the kids up.

07:33.310 --> 07:35.190
They're gonna be
so happy you're back.

07:35.350 --> 07:37.310
I'm only here
to take them to school.

07:40.390 --> 07:43.990
You and me,
we're in big trouble, Danny.

07:46.230 --> 07:48.870
Look, I hate being away.
I hate it, but...

07:49.030 --> 07:51.790
- Jen, I know something's gotta give.
- Good.

07:51.950 --> 07:55.630
Yeah. So I've been thinking:
let's just get someone in.

07:55.790 --> 07:59.670
Let's pay for them to come in, two
or three times a week to help out.

07:59.830 --> 08:02.030
I am further down the road than you.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.590
I came here to tell you
that Ray has to go.

08:07.470 --> 08:11.350
I'm not putting my dad in a home.
OK? That is not gonna happen.

08:11.510 --> 08:15.510
You just have to take him to your
sister's. That's the ultimatum.

08:15.670 --> 08:18.870
Ray goes to stay with Sarah.
He is her father too.

08:19.030 --> 08:22.430
- That is never gonna happen.
- Oh, she has done nothing so far.

08:30.790 --> 08:32.789
Make it happen.

08:37.429 --> 08:39.429
And stop smoking.

08:44.230 --> 08:48.790
It was any old burglar
going through any old house.

08:50.430 --> 08:53.630
And my very expensive iPad
isn't good enough for him?

08:54.270 --> 08:56.030
It was on the side.
You can't miss it.

08:56.190 --> 08:59.150
- Maybe he's got an iPad.
- It was Jesse.

09:00.590 --> 09:03.230
And he was in his old room
looking for photos.

09:03.390 --> 09:04.990
I know it was...

09:06.870 --> 09:11.030
- I felt something. I still do.
- No, you just want it to be him.

09:13.390 --> 09:15.110
You don't understand.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.590
Or maybe I do.

09:35.430 --> 09:37.350
It was him.

10:25.270 --> 10:27.270
<i>Where were you, Danny?</i>

11:03.510 --> 11:05.350
But what if she's right?

11:06.670 --> 11:08.110
Shouldn't you be at work?

11:08.270 --> 11:10.630
No, there's nothing there
that can't wait.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.550
Do you think that's blood
or ketchup there? Look.

11:13.710 --> 11:15.350
It's ketchup, Dad.
It's all ketchup.

11:15.510 --> 11:18.630
Look, why don't you just sit down?
You can take your pinny off.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.230
- No.
- We can just talk about this.

11:20.390 --> 11:23.350
- No, I've gotta start prepping.
- So you open a little late today.

11:23.510 --> 11:25.590
You're becoming obsessed,
like your mother.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.390
- Fat lot of good it's done her.
- But he came to our house.

11:28.550 --> 11:30.470
It was just a kid breaking in.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.710
And if he's alive,
why doesn't he call us? Hmm?

11:32.870 --> 11:36.190
We're his family. Why doesn't he
come and find us? Explain that. Huh?

11:44.870 --> 11:47.310
I still believe that he's gone,
Mark.

11:51.790 --> 11:53.510
But, whatever happened...

11:56.070 --> 11:58.070
it wasn't our fault.

12:01.310 --> 12:03.310
We have to let it go.

12:20.190 --> 12:21.350
Dad.

12:23.030 --> 12:24.550
Dad, what are you doing?

12:24.710 --> 12:27.470
I need a new place
to hide your baseball bat.

12:27.630 --> 12:28.990
Dad.

12:29.150 --> 12:32.510
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here. Look at me.

12:32.670 --> 12:37.550
Listen, I had nothing to do
with Jesse's disappearance.

12:37.710 --> 12:39.790
I was visiting
Hannah's and Jodie's graves -

12:39.950 --> 12:41.710
Frank's kids
killed in that car crash.

12:41.870 --> 12:45.110
I went there whenever I was unhappy.
I was at the cemetery, Dad.

12:52.190 --> 12:54.390
I thought you'd killed him!

12:56.910 --> 12:59.430
So every time you looked at me,

12:59.590 --> 13:02.710
you thought... you were looking
at a murderer?

13:13.510 --> 13:15.110
Are you smoking again?

13:17.790 --> 13:20.550
- Can I have one?
- No, Dad. You gave up years ago.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.910
Listen to me, this is important.

13:25.070 --> 13:28.350
I love you. OK?

13:28.510 --> 13:30.430
I love you.

13:30.590 --> 13:32.550
It's easy to say.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.630
Give me a cigarette.

13:34.790 --> 13:39.590
And I know that you were trying
to protect me all those years

13:39.750 --> 13:41.830
and I love you for that.

13:41.990 --> 13:43.950
I love you.

13:49.150 --> 13:50.150
Just one.

14:32.910 --> 14:34.230
Hello?

14:38.990 --> 14:40.910
Can I help you with something?

14:58.310 --> 15:00.310
- Bye, Mum.
- Bye, baby.

15:02.350 --> 15:03.950
There you go, sweetie.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.310
Pru! Pru!

15:12.430 --> 15:15.230
- So, my mom's coming over.
- Oh, nice.

15:15.390 --> 15:17.190
Why don't we ask her
to look after Nico?

15:17.350 --> 15:20.070
You know, that way you and me can
shoot off on our own for a bit.

15:20.230 --> 15:24.550
You know, somewhere quiet, somewhere
where it's just the two of us.

15:25.670 --> 15:29.430
Cause us fighting all the time,
I can see what it's doing to Nico.

15:31.150 --> 15:33.630
What do you think? Good idea, huh?

15:35.390 --> 15:36.390
Great idea.

15:41.030 --> 15:42.990
Be just like the good old days.

15:53.110 --> 15:55.990
- Are you ready for Mr Payne?
- Yeah, let's do it.

15:56.870 --> 15:59.950
Ah, I trust you haven't,
er, forgotten about

16:00.110 --> 16:02.350
our glam rock charity gig?
It's today.

16:02.510 --> 16:05.550
- You did sign up.
- Yeah, it's all I can think about.

16:06.950 --> 16:08.870
Love you, too!

16:17.870 --> 16:20.550
Can I have a word with you outside?

16:25.110 --> 16:26.950
Listen, you can't represent
this man.

16:27.110 --> 16:30.230
I ran a check on his plates.
This is the guy that beat you up.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.510
Both misunderstandings.
Both cleared up.

16:33.630 --> 16:35.350
OK, cool.

16:35.510 --> 16:38.390
Well, try misunderstanding this.
He beats up a lot of people.

16:38.550 --> 16:41.030
In fact, his record covers
the whole range of violence.

16:41.190 --> 16:42.950
He makes his living
off of prostitution.

16:43.110 --> 16:46.150
He calls me up, he says
he wants to confess to two murders.

16:46.310 --> 16:47.710
So here I am, Danny.

16:47.870 --> 16:49.990
This is what I do.
This is what you do.

16:50.150 --> 16:53.110
So do me a favour
and let me help you out for once.

16:56.830 --> 16:59.230
Porter had a girl killed
who used to work for me.

16:59.390 --> 17:00.950
Who was that?

17:01.110 --> 17:02.910
Selena Callaway.

17:10.069 --> 17:12.589
Selena Callaway
was killed by Porter?

17:13.230 --> 17:16.349
Well, he farmed it out.
He didn't do it personally.

17:16.510 --> 17:20.310
But, if he's targeting my girls,
he's gonna target me.

17:20.869 --> 17:24.109
So I made a pre-emptive strike.

17:26.030 --> 17:28.150
- Then you went to his house...
- To kill him.

17:28.310 --> 17:29.430
OK.

17:29.590 --> 17:34.510
The other guy, Matt Lohan,
he just got in the way.

17:36.350 --> 17:38.390
Tried to defend Porter.

17:39.430 --> 17:43.190
Porter shot me
and then he shot Lohan.

17:43.350 --> 17:44.870
Porter started it.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.750
I finished it.

17:54.310 --> 17:56.950
So who did kill Selena Callaway?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.750
Harry Dempsey.

18:00.270 --> 18:01.990
Works for Porter.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.550
Well, worked.

18:07.950 --> 18:09.830
So where's this Harry Dempsey now?

18:09.990 --> 18:11.910
Laying low, I'd imagine.

18:21.150 --> 18:22.430
Is that him?

18:25.310 --> 18:27.430
It's an age-progression image.

18:28.590 --> 18:31.710
Well, they never really
look like anyone, do they?

18:31.870 --> 18:36.910
I mean, it's possible
but, on the whole, no.

18:37.070 --> 18:38.990
Well... maybe.

18:41.630 --> 18:43.270
I don't know.

18:43.430 --> 18:47.470
Is Harry Dempsey local?
Where's he from? What's his accent?

18:47.630 --> 18:50.030
- I don't have a clue.
- Describe him.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.430
Shaved head.

18:53.590 --> 18:55.630
Kind of wiry.
A bit shorter than me.

18:55.790 --> 18:59.190
Look, I really don't know.
He's unremarkable.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.430
Two eyes, two ears, a nose, yeah?

19:03.990 --> 19:05.990
I'm trying to help you.

19:06.150 --> 19:09.870
Yeah, well, try a little bit harder.
OK? Thanks.

19:10.030 --> 19:12.070
I don't know.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.790
OK. Well, let's keep it simple.

19:16.270 --> 19:19.830
Where did you last see
Harry Dempsey?

19:22.190 --> 19:24.750
We were running a scam
out of the Old Town.

19:24.910 --> 19:26.750
It's a hotel.

19:27.710 --> 19:29.510
<i>You killed someone.</i>

19:35.310 --> 19:37.110
They had a shooting here.

19:37.790 --> 19:42.030
Bloodstains were found two days ago
in the Envy Room,

19:42.190 --> 19:43.830
whatever that is.

19:43.990 --> 19:46.350
Oh, old blood, a week old.

19:46.510 --> 19:49.470
Scatter patterns
typical of gunshots.

19:49.630 --> 19:52.510
There was a lot of blood,
but no body was found.

19:54.470 --> 19:55.430
Hey.

20:05.910 --> 20:08.830
<i>♪ Good morning, good morning
Sunbeams will soon shine through ♪</i>

20:08.990 --> 20:11.830
<i>♪ Good morning, good morning to you
and you and you and you ♪</i>

20:11.990 --> 20:15.390
Morning. This man ran a string
of girls out of your hotel.

20:15.550 --> 20:17.070
You recognise him, right?

20:17.230 --> 20:20.590
String of what?
I'm so bad with faces...

20:20.750 --> 20:23.630
- His name's Payne.
- And names.

20:23.790 --> 20:25.710
How about this one: Harry Dempsey?

20:26.830 --> 20:28.270
He likes attacking people.

20:28.430 --> 20:30.670
He'll be the wiry guy
with the shaved head that

20:30.830 --> 20:33.230
you decided not to backchat
on a number of occasions.

20:33.390 --> 20:36.870
Does that ring any bells,
or are you deaf as well?

20:37.990 --> 20:40.430
Oh, sorry, did you say something?

20:47.110 --> 20:49.270
Sorry.
Says you're a defrocked lawyer.

20:49.430 --> 20:51.590
And a nightmare in the witness box.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.990
Somehow, I never say
what you want me to.

20:54.150 --> 20:57.070
Shall we take a look at the room
where the shooting took place?

20:57.230 --> 21:01.230
The Envy Room. Yes. Yes, you must.
Yes. Perfect. Brilliant.

21:01.390 --> 21:05.750
Because if I say to you "Envy",
what springs to mind?

21:05.910 --> 21:08.750
- What?
- I'm talking colour schemes.

21:08.910 --> 21:11.670
You see, they've gone
for caramel and beige.

21:11.830 --> 21:14.710
Carpets, walls, ceiling.
The whole lot.

21:14.870 --> 21:18.390
The room where the shooting took
place has been redecorated?

21:18.550 --> 21:21.670
Yes, well, there was blood
all up the walls.

21:21.830 --> 21:25.030
What did you want them to do,
make a feature of it?

21:25.190 --> 21:28.390
Harry Dempsey might come looking
for you if we don't find him first.

21:28.550 --> 21:32.390
Ooh, I don't think
he'll be back here, do you?

21:33.310 --> 21:34.270
Oh.

21:35.110 --> 21:36.150
OK.

21:46.110 --> 21:49.590
I'll meet you in the car, after
you've finished killing yourself.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.270
Danny!

22:34.710 --> 22:37.950
Dempsey or Jesse?
It's Dempsey's car.

22:43.630 --> 22:45.990
- Yeah?
- <i>Danny, I need you to come in.</i>

22:46.150 --> 22:48.470
<i>They've found something else
in Newman's garden.</i>

22:48.630 --> 22:49.870
Why? What is it?

22:52.870 --> 22:56.070
The book Jesse Wells had
when he disappeared.

22:58.710 --> 23:02.670
It was buried two feet down,
so under the top soil and laid flat.

23:10.230 --> 23:13.310
So, what?
Jesse was held by Newman?

23:13.950 --> 23:17.230
He escaped? Went back? It makes
sense. His DNA was found there.

23:17.910 --> 23:22.070
All right, run all the checks
on this and let's crack on. OK?

23:29.150 --> 23:31.350
And I feel so bad...

23:33.270 --> 23:35.270
Cause he was being kind.

23:37.030 --> 23:39.870
He just wants things to be nice
between us.

23:40.750 --> 23:44.830
And, Mark, I treat him appallingly.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.870
I mean, I really do.

23:47.750 --> 23:50.550
But he'll just come back
with some new suggestion.

23:50.710 --> 23:51.990
Like what?

23:52.150 --> 23:55.950
Like let's just go away,
just him and me.

23:57.190 --> 23:59.710
- You don't wanna do that?
- No, I don't.

24:00.750 --> 24:03.470
No. Oh, I dunno.

24:04.910 --> 24:07.910
I mean, no. No, I don't.
How could I?

24:08.470 --> 24:12.030
How could I? He touched my arm
and it made my skin crawl.

24:14.430 --> 24:16.590
But then he brings Nico up.

24:17.910 --> 24:21.430
When you bring children into the equation,
it changes everything.

24:25.430 --> 24:27.790
I really need to talk to you...

24:27.950 --> 24:29.710
I'm so sorry, I'm on call.

24:29.870 --> 24:30.990
That's OK.

24:31.470 --> 24:33.910
It's not OK,
cause it means I have to go.

24:34.070 --> 24:36.150
It's fine. I have to do something
this afternoon.

24:36.310 --> 24:38.990
- OK.
- Erm, what time do you finish?

24:39.150 --> 24:40.910
I'll... I'll come and meet you.

24:41.070 --> 24:42.750
Seven. Great.

24:42.910 --> 24:45.230
- Oh, my God. Sorry. I'm...
- It's OK. Don't worry.

24:45.390 --> 24:47.750
- OK. Bye.
- To be continued.

24:47.910 --> 24:49.350
Yeah.

24:49.510 --> 24:51.230
Hi. Yeah, I'm coming.

24:55.750 --> 24:58.310
Erm, one final reminder.

24:58.470 --> 25:02.230
Full attendance is required
for the glam rock gig this evening.

25:02.390 --> 25:04.750
By order of the DI.

25:04.910 --> 25:08.350
Thank you very much. Thank you.
All right. Come on. Let's go to work.

25:08.510 --> 25:10.710
- Mickey? Taser time.
- Oh, no, that's not funny.

25:10.870 --> 25:13.590
- You shouldn't be handling that.
- It's been decommissioned.

25:13.750 --> 25:15.830
Oh, shit.

25:20.950 --> 25:22.750
Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.630
Ally, can you cover for me
this afternoon?

25:25.790 --> 25:27.550
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

25:30.950 --> 25:34.430
Hey, Jen, it's me.
Er... I'm gonna do it.

25:34.590 --> 25:36.070
OK? I'm gonna do it now.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.950
Can you just...?

25:38.750 --> 25:41.590
Can you just come with me,
so I don't back out?

26:34.150 --> 26:36.750
- Hey, sis.
- Hi.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.750
Dad needs a change of scene.

26:41.790 --> 26:43.190
Does he?

26:48.630 --> 26:51.430
Well, I guess this is what it
feels like to dump your old dad.

26:52.910 --> 26:55.990
- Go home, shall we?
- Are you finished for the day?

26:57.110 --> 26:58.590
Er, yeah. Well, I'm...

26:58.750 --> 27:02.110
The whole station's supposed to go
to this, erm, charity gig,

27:02.270 --> 27:03.750
but I could skip that.

27:03.910 --> 27:05.750
No. No, no, we should go.

27:05.910 --> 27:08.510
We should do this.
This is what I'm talking about.

27:08.670 --> 27:10.310
I wanna meet the people
you work with.

27:10.470 --> 27:14.790
Put faces to names, you know,
join the two worlds.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.110
What about the kids?

27:20.270 --> 27:21.750
Oh, I'll make a phone call.

27:21.910 --> 27:24.270
You and me at a gig.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.830
Hello!

27:31.390 --> 27:33.150
He was wearing
exactly the same clothes

27:33.310 --> 27:35.070
as the guy that broke
into my mum's house.

27:35.230 --> 27:37.590
He was wearing this hoodie
and this backpack.

27:38.710 --> 27:40.230
- You mean...?
- I don't know.

27:40.390 --> 27:43.630
I don't know. I mean, I'm not saying
that it's Jesse, right?

27:43.790 --> 27:45.830
So this afternoon
I went back to the woods,

27:45.990 --> 27:48.550
to have a look where this guy
had been watching me from.

27:48.710 --> 27:51.310
Right? And there was
this patch of ground

27:51.470 --> 27:54.150
that had been raked over
and it was warm to the touch.

27:54.310 --> 27:57.110
- There's been a fire there. So...
- Hang on, wait. What?

27:57.270 --> 28:01.830
But if it is Jesse, why would he be
going back to where he disappeared,

28:01.990 --> 28:05.150
lighting fires
and then covering them up?

28:05.310 --> 28:08.630
I dunno. I dunno. That's why
I'm going back there tonight.

28:08.790 --> 28:10.790
- What, on your own?
- Yeah.

28:10.950 --> 28:13.590
No. Not a good idea.
He could be a psychopath.

28:13.750 --> 28:15.910
Oh, come on. I have to go.

28:16.070 --> 28:18.510
I have to find out.
I have to. I can't just leave it.

28:18.670 --> 28:22.150
- OK, I'm coming with you.
- OK, that is really not a good idea.

28:22.310 --> 28:24.230
You think I'm a pussy?

28:26.150 --> 28:27.670
I can fight, remember.

28:27.830 --> 28:29.830
Oh, I think
you might be forgetting this.

28:32.390 --> 28:35.030
- Ow!
- See? I'm coming.

28:40.710 --> 28:43.550
Listen, I'm thinking that maybe
we should, erm...

28:44.470 --> 28:46.190
We should get ourselves a cab home.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.950
- Oh, what, have a drink or two?
- Mmm-hmm. Or three or four.

28:49.110 --> 28:51.230
- Three or four?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:52.270 --> 28:55.070
Danny! Are you out of your mind?
You were in the clear.

28:55.230 --> 28:57.350
- Ally covered for you.
- Hey, he's here because

28:57.510 --> 29:00.030
he's a lover of music
and he's a true fan.

29:00.190 --> 29:01.990
Don't touch the suit.

29:02.150 --> 29:04.710

All right, hey, can I get, er,
two rum and cokes and two beers?

29:21.950 --> 29:25.110
What, what have you got?
Is it draft or bottled?

29:25.550 --> 29:28.950
- Erm, it's no alcohol, I'm afraid.
- Come again?

29:29.110 --> 29:34.470
Well, it's a charity gig for PADD,
for Police Against Drink Driving.

29:35.310 --> 29:37.510
It's soft drinks
and fruit punch only.

29:37.670 --> 29:40.150
Great. That's great.

29:42.350 --> 29:45.270
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello, 'ello!
What a turnout, uh?

29:45.430 --> 29:48.070
We are Firefly
and we're gonna start with this.

29:54.150 --> 29:56.230

and the sixth dance for you.

30:25.110 --> 30:26.630
And if you fancy this one, too...

30:32.670 --> 30:34.190
Tough one, mate.

30:36.550 --> 30:39.110
Don't tell me this was
his idea of a fun night?

30:39.270 --> 30:41.430
No. No, no, I warned her.
I warned you, right?

30:41.590 --> 30:44.590
No, this is fine. This is fine.
It's... It's fun.

30:44.750 --> 30:47.910
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
This is fun.

30:48.070 --> 30:50.630
- Come on, let's have a dance.
- Nah, I'm all right.

30:50.790 --> 30:52.310
- Go on.
- Nah, it's OK.

30:52.470 --> 30:54.550
Hold my bag.
You stay here with your drink.

30:57.670 --> 30:59.430
Great.

31:14.470 --> 31:15.990
I'm just gonna get my jacket.

31:30.350 --> 31:32.670
Actually, why am I doing this?

31:33.790 --> 31:35.550
Why aren't you doing this
with Slade?

31:38.590 --> 31:40.310
I dunno.

fire's just down here.

32:17.870 --> 32:19.030
Oh.

32:19.190 --> 32:22.230
Oh, no.
Oh, my God. Are you OK?

32:22.390 --> 32:23.830
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

32:23.990 --> 32:26.550
- I think so. Ow!
- Hold the torch. Let's have a look.

32:27.950 --> 32:29.270
All right?

32:29.430 --> 32:31.550
Is it scratched,
or have you got something in it?

32:31.710 --> 32:34.910
Erm, I dunno. Maybe both.

32:35.870 --> 32:37.830
You're the one looking at it.

32:45.470 --> 32:46.790
Mark!

32:46.950 --> 32:49.790
Oh... I'll wait in the car, then.

32:51.430 --> 32:52.550
Great.

33:35.550 --> 33:38.110
- I need to get in there.
- You're not coming in here.

33:38.270 --> 33:39.910
- I need to get in!
- No, no, no, no. Hey!

33:40.070 --> 33:42.430
- Out you go. Go on.
- How many exits are there?

33:42.590 --> 33:44.390
- What's going on?
- How many exits are there

33:44.550 --> 33:47.110
- in this building?
- Just one. I'm calling the police.

33:47.270 --> 33:48.790
I'm calling them too.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.830
- Yeah?
- <i>Danny!</i>

33:52.990 --> 33:55.310
Danny! Danny, I've got him.

33:55.470 --> 33:58.110
- What? Who?
- <i>Jesse.</i>

33:58.270 --> 34:00.630
I've got him trapped in the building.

34:02.150 --> 34:05.310
Sorry to disturb the party. I need
as many officers as possible.

34:05.470 --> 34:07.870
We have a possible sighting
of a murder suspect.

34:08.030 --> 34:09.870
As many people as I can right now.

34:10.590 --> 34:12.550
Thank you. Thank you very much.

34:12.710 --> 34:14.590
Sorry, babe. Babe, I'm so sorry.

34:14.750 --> 34:16.630
I've gotta go. I love you.
Take the car.

34:18.350 --> 34:20.030
<i>Mark? Are you OK?</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

34:20.190 --> 34:22.830
I'm good. I'm good.
Where are you? How are you?

34:22.989 --> 34:25.030
I'm fine. I'm... I'm by the car.

34:25.190 --> 34:26.750
<i>You just took off.</i>

34:26.909 --> 34:29.270
Well, didn't you see him?
I-I think it was Jesse.

34:29.429 --> 34:31.070
I've got him holed up
in this building.

34:31.230 --> 34:34.150
Pru, Danny's here.
I can't really talk right now.

34:34.310 --> 34:36.429
You get yourself home.
I'll call you tomorrow.

34:40.750 --> 34:44.030
- Talk to me.
- He's in this building here.

34:44.670 --> 34:48.270
OK, listen up. I want two groups.
Ally, you play points.

34:48.429 --> 34:51.870
Spread out. I want every inch
covered. Go! Go! Go! Thank you.

34:53.230 --> 34:55.230
- How many exits are there?
- Just the one.

34:55.389 --> 34:57.070
OK, good.

34:57.230 --> 34:59.910
- Danny, can I go in there?
- No, no, no. Let them do their job.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.790
OK, we're in.

35:07.790 --> 35:10.990
All right, guys,
spread out and keep in contact.

35:41.270 --> 35:44.510
Yeah. All right. Copy that.
Just send everyone down.

35:44.670 --> 35:46.510
There's no-one up there.

35:47.150 --> 35:50.270
What? No. No, no, no.

35:50.430 --> 35:52.950
That's not possible. I saw him
run in there. I chased him.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.950
I saw him run up those stairs.
Danny, he's in there.

35:56.110 --> 35:58.430
- There's no-one up there now.
- Then check again, then!

35:58.590 --> 36:00.990
- We've been up to the roof and back.
- OK. Is there any way

36:01.150 --> 36:03.830
that he could have got to another
building from up there?

36:03.990 --> 36:06.990
Not unless he's Spider-Man.

36:09.470 --> 36:12.510
OK, er... sorry, everyone.

36:12.670 --> 36:15.510
False alarm.
Thanks for coming down.

36:15.670 --> 36:17.470
- Your mate's loopy. You know that?
- Yeah.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.710
Coming up with crap like this,
it's crazy.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.070
All right. Thank you.
OK, thank you very much.

36:22.230 --> 36:25.230
Danny... Danny, I saw him.
He's in there.

36:26.030 --> 36:28.190
- He's in there.
- Yeah. Well, he's not in there now.

36:28.350 --> 36:31.430
And there's nowhere to hide.
All right? We scoured the place.

36:31.590 --> 36:34.830
Come on. It's been a long night.
I'll take you home.

37:01.390 --> 37:03.470
<i>Hello?</i>

37:03.630 --> 37:05.190
Hi, Mum.

37:05.350 --> 37:07.230
<i>Oh, hello, stranger.</i>

37:08.190 --> 37:09.750
Sorry, I've...

37:10.830 --> 37:12.670
How are you? How's things?

37:12.830 --> 37:15.750
<i>Well, your father's been drinking
all day.</i>

37:15.910 --> 37:17.750
Alan, no! I want you out.

37:17.910 --> 37:19.710
<i>Back to Mark's. Come on!</i>

37:19.870 --> 37:21.310
Just a sex object, aren't I?

37:21.470 --> 37:24.070
Once you've had your way with me,
that's it, I can go.

37:24.230 --> 37:26.750
Well, at least your long-term
memory's holding up.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.790
Mum, do you need me
to come and pick him up?

37:28.950 --> 37:30.510
<i>No, you're all right.</i>

37:30.670 --> 37:33.310
- <i>Maybe come in the morning, yeah?</i>
- Yeah, OK.

37:33.470 --> 37:34.550
Bye.

37:35.390 --> 37:36.750
Oh, dear.

38:04.710 --> 38:06.230
Where have you been?

38:06.390 --> 38:08.350
What do you care, Mark?

38:11.630 --> 38:13.390
Just asking.

38:16.390 --> 38:18.670
Look, Slade, this morning,
you know I...

38:24.230 --> 38:27.790
- Look, I just wanna say...
- Look, I messed up with Newman.

38:29.710 --> 38:31.230
Yeah.

38:32.630 --> 38:34.630
But I'd do it again, Mark.

38:47.430 --> 38:49.230
Is that directed at me or yourself?

38:49.390 --> 38:52.590
Oh, no, mate. Mainly me, me, me.

38:52.750 --> 38:56.950
But, you know, you shouldn't really
feel left out of it.

38:57.110 --> 39:00.030
I chase people who aren't there
and you kill people.

39:00.190 --> 39:03.430
We're mad.
Louder. Say it louder.

39:04.630 --> 39:06.550
You know what's really scary,
though?

39:06.710 --> 39:08.470
That person I chased...

39:10.230 --> 39:12.590
he was as real as you are there.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.950
- Right there.
- I'm not here, I'm in bed.

39:15.110 --> 39:16.670
I'm trying to be serious here.

39:16.830 --> 39:19.270
What I'm saying is
I know what madness is.

39:19.430 --> 39:21.110
Madness is when you know
you're right

39:21.270 --> 39:23.310
and the rest of the world thinks
you're wrong.

39:23.470 --> 39:25.550
Well, sanity's consensus, isn't it?

39:26.510 --> 39:28.470
Not what's true. You're right.

39:31.190 --> 39:33.190
But consensus can change.

39:33.750 --> 39:37.030
Therefore,
maybe there was someone there.

39:37.190 --> 39:39.790
Or, rather,
maybe there is someone there.

39:39.950 --> 39:43.710
They vanished into somewhere
that they can't vanish.

39:43.870 --> 39:46.030
No-one saw them, apart from me.

39:46.190 --> 39:48.750
Danny goes in and searches
the whole building

39:48.910 --> 39:51.750
and there's no-one,
absolutely no-one.

39:51.910 --> 39:54.470
You know, I'm just chasing someone
that I wanna chase.

39:54.630 --> 39:57.630
You know, some sprinter that
I'm never gonna be able to catch.

39:57.790 --> 40:00.470
It's the burglar that
my dad described exactly,

40:00.630 --> 40:04.150
right down to the backpack he was
wearing with that smiley face on it.

40:05.510 --> 40:07.190
You know what's really scary?

40:07.350 --> 40:09.030
I thought we'd had the scary stuff.

40:10.310 --> 40:12.110
I still think I saw him.

41:32.870 --> 41:35.030
You explain this. OK?

41:38.190 --> 41:39.790
What?

41:39.950 --> 41:42.270
The <i>Gulliver's Travel</i> picture book
that we found

41:42.430 --> 41:45.270
in Newman's garden yesterday,
it's not an original.

41:45.430 --> 41:47.830
- What do you mean?
- It's a reprint from 2005.

41:47.990 --> 41:49.630
It's a second edition.

41:49.790 --> 41:53.310
It's a reprint made ten years after
Jesse disappeared.

41:53.470 --> 41:55.830
But it's exactly like the one
that Jesse had that day.

41:55.990 --> 41:57.430
- Right.
- And found at Newman's.

41:59.390 --> 42:01.590
OK. No, no. OK.

42:03.670 --> 42:05.790
No, it makes no sense.
This is just...

42:10.750 --> 42:13.190
Do you think
someone's screwing with us?

42:14.150 --> 42:16.510
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

42:17.710 --> 42:22.030
All right. Jesse's DNA is found
at two different murder scenes.

42:22.190 --> 42:25.150
Someone is stealing photos
from Julie's house.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.790
Mark thinks someone is
following him. And now this...

42:27.950 --> 42:30.310
The same picture book Jesse had.

42:30.470 --> 42:31.550
But not the same.

42:31.710 --> 42:34.230
And found at Newman's house,
where a body was found also.

42:34.390 --> 42:35.230
Right.

42:36.550 --> 42:38.630
Someone is setting us up
deliberately.

43:08.470 --> 43:09.630
Just came in.

43:14.430 --> 43:16.070
What is it?

43:18.510 --> 43:21.550
It's from Jakob Marosi.
He wants to see me.

43:21.710 --> 43:24.350
He says he wants
to tell us about Jesse.

43:24.510 --> 43:25.790
What?

43:25.950 --> 43:27.510
Who else is lying about that day?
