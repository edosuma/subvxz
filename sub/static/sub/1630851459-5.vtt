00:01.368 --> 00:03.301
Hey, girl!
Thanks for making the drive.

00:03.337 --> 00:05.237
I'm so psyched you're coming.

00:05.306 --> 00:08.607
Oh! And I got that rosé
jody likes so we can chug it,

00:08.609 --> 00:12.110
Crush the charcutes,
and hit the town.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.712
I know!
Mothers, lock up your sons

00:13.714 --> 00:16.515
'cause shans and her gals
are in the hammer!

00:16.650 --> 00:18.784
'kay, gotta go.
I need two hands. See ya soon.

00:25.860 --> 00:26.825
'kay.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.196
(grunting)

00:31.265 --> 00:34.265
Wow! That is quality.

00:34.301 --> 00:35.467
Okay.

00:37.137 --> 00:40.038
(grunting)

00:45.112 --> 00:48.547
Damn it. Zipper, just...

00:48.682 --> 00:49.515
(groaning)

00:51.752 --> 00:52.818
Oh. Okay.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.161
(sighing)

01:03.297 --> 01:05.163
It's inside out.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.232
♪ I don't lose my cool ♪

01:07.367 --> 01:10.368

01:21.682 --> 01:24.082
You gave your cat alcohol?
You know it's toxic, right?

01:24.217 --> 01:25.917
I swear, I didn't give
him anything!

01:25.986 --> 01:27.051
I poured myself a drink

01:27.088 --> 01:28.453
And I turned away for one minute

01:28.489 --> 01:30.188
To watch a video of two otters
holding hands.

01:30.324 --> 01:31.523
Such a classic.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.991
I thought middens
was watching with me,

01:33.060 --> 01:35.160
But when I reached for his paw,
he was whisker deep in rosé.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.795
He looks fine.
Really?

01:36.864 --> 01:38.797
He tried to make out with
snowball and kicked over a lamp.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.599
Kind of screams,
"I got my drink on."

01:40.734 --> 01:42.467
Just keep an eye on him tonight.
I wouldn't worry.

01:42.470 --> 01:44.002
Shannon:
Worrying's kind of my thing.

01:44.038 --> 01:45.270
Well, I should probably--

01:45.405 --> 01:47.139
There's just a lot
going on right now.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.473
Big night?

01:48.476 --> 01:50.309
It was supposed to be.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.476
I had friends
coming in from toronto,

01:51.545 --> 01:53.912
But with the middens sitch...

01:53.914 --> 01:55.079
You're welcome to a glass.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.982
Doctor lara.
Not you, you big lush!

01:56.984 --> 01:58.350
No. I should be going.

01:58.485 --> 02:00.285
Oh, please, have something
as a thank you for

02:00.420 --> 02:02.020
The after-hours help.

02:02.056 --> 02:03.288
I really have an early...

02:03.290 --> 02:04.689
Is that truffle brie?

02:04.824 --> 02:07.826
Yes! It tastes like creamy dirt,
but in a great way.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.694
Maybe just a taste.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.396
I got it at
the farmer's market from--

02:11.465 --> 02:12.697
Half-goatee guy?

02:12.733 --> 02:13.698
Half-goatee guy!

02:13.734 --> 02:14.900
How does he only
have half like that?

02:15.035 --> 02:16.100
Why did he start shaving?

02:16.137 --> 02:17.269
Why did he stop?

02:17.404 --> 02:18.704
Can he not grow
hair on that side?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.305
So many questions.

02:20.440 --> 02:22.174
Although the goatee answers
one of them, he is single.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.675
But, oddly, still kind of cute.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.744
Right?
I mean, the one half.

02:25.746 --> 02:26.711
Which half?

02:28.115 --> 02:29.714
♪

02:29.783 --> 02:32.116
Sorry, boo.
Rick says the limo's booked.

02:32.153 --> 02:33.852
Rick's limo fleet is one limo?

02:33.987 --> 02:35.887
I mean, technically two,
but he's been living

02:35.923 --> 02:38.123
In the other one since
his wife kicked him out.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.925
But it's tina's birthday,

02:39.994 --> 02:43.195
And I promised the crew
a limo to the bowling alley.

02:43.264 --> 02:44.429
Well, take an uber.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.064
There's six of us.

02:46.133 --> 02:47.933
'kay, well, I could drive you.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.468
I mean, two at a time,
if I move the turntables.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.138
Forget it. We'll do shrooms
and take the bus.

02:53.140 --> 02:54.206
Oh, man.

02:54.341 --> 02:55.407
I miss out on the best nights!

02:55.542 --> 02:57.075
(phone vibrating)
ooh.

02:57.144 --> 02:58.610
I gotta go.

02:58.612 --> 03:00.478
New tvs came in and raoul's
already dropped,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.146
Like, two of 'em.

03:02.183 --> 03:04.015
#techcitylife!

03:04.051 --> 03:06.384
Mm. Peace.

03:11.291 --> 03:12.757
(car starting)

03:19.733 --> 03:20.932
What?

03:20.935 --> 03:22.234
I need a favour.

03:22.303 --> 03:24.803
Yeah, well,
I need a new fishing rod

03:24.805 --> 03:26.672
And 10 years of my life back.

03:26.674 --> 03:27.706
What?

03:27.708 --> 03:29.174
I'm kidding!
I mean, not really.

03:29.309 --> 03:30.575
What's the favour?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.810
♪

03:32.846 --> 03:35.514
Ah! Ah.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.249
Shannon:
Ooh! Looking sharp, paulie.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.351
An apple soda.
Yummy in my tummy!

03:40.387 --> 03:41.987
Are you drunk?
Ah, no!

03:41.989 --> 03:44.522
I'm just living the hammer
dream. Don't wake me yet!

03:44.558 --> 03:45.924
I swear I smell
something on your breath.

03:46.059 --> 03:49.461
Ah, relax. It's just
a kombucha lara recommended.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.130
So fun swapping reccos
with my girl gang!

03:52.199 --> 03:53.598
You're in a gang with lara?

03:53.634 --> 03:55.466
Oh, no.
Not an actual gang.

03:55.502 --> 03:58.337
But we did have a bit of
a girls' night last night.

03:58.472 --> 03:59.805
I'm a girl.

04:01.275 --> 04:02.974
Yeah, no.
It was more of a unoffish

04:03.043 --> 04:05.010
Cat emergency slash hang.

04:05.079 --> 04:07.446
I would've texted you,
but I just don't have your nu--

04:07.448 --> 04:09.514
(phone ringing)

04:09.516 --> 04:10.648
For next time.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.951
Cool.
(phone ringing)

04:14.488 --> 04:16.088
My mom's number. For backup.

04:16.223 --> 04:17.355
Tell her you're a church friend.

04:17.424 --> 04:18.556
Shannon:
Ah. Okay.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.325
Oh, hey, lars!

04:20.327 --> 04:22.794
Crazy night, huh?

04:22.929 --> 04:23.861
Oh, yeah.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.432
Who drank my almond milk?

04:27.567 --> 04:29.201
We should do it again
sometime.

04:29.336 --> 04:30.435
Drink her almond milk?

04:30.437 --> 04:32.137
Uh, no. Hang out.

04:32.139 --> 04:35.240
Maybe some night this week
after work, or whatevs.

04:35.309 --> 04:36.441
Ah, this week's tough.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.576
Yeah.
The weekend's better.

04:37.711 --> 04:38.676
I'm free.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.245
Not this weekend.
Lots going on.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.147
Oh, hangin' with
the rav-ster?

04:42.149 --> 04:44.583
No, but thanks
for the invite.

04:47.788 --> 04:48.720
Ouch.

04:48.855 --> 04:50.589
(laughing)
okay, no offense, paul,

04:50.724 --> 04:53.258
But, uh, you don't
understand career women.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.193
It's a lot of, uh,
go-go-go.

04:55.262 --> 04:57.328
That's what my sister
said before she burnt out,

04:57.364 --> 05:00.165
But my schedule is wide open.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.933
(slurping)

05:03.070 --> 05:05.404
That should keep
venture out of trouble.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.205
And high as a kite.

05:07.207 --> 05:08.807
I know
it's for lyme disease.

05:09.943 --> 05:12.610
So, I was thinking of
ordering bao for lunch.

05:12.646 --> 05:14.413
Maybe someone would like to--

05:14.415 --> 05:15.680
Hey, babe.

05:15.749 --> 05:16.481
Hey!

05:16.550 --> 05:18.183
You can just
call me kristian.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.251
(laughing)

05:19.253 --> 05:20.385
(barking)

05:20.520 --> 05:22.820
Whoa! Hey, hey!
Down! Down.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.389
Kristian:
It's okay. He's just saying hi.

05:24.524 --> 05:25.557
Ravi's scared of dogs.

05:25.692 --> 05:28.159
I'm just not used
to their chi,

05:28.195 --> 05:29.294
Or their horizontal chakras.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.530
I get it. Not everyone can
connect like me and lara.

05:34.201 --> 05:35.767
With animals.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.436
I'm just going to
finish up a couple things

05:37.571 --> 05:39.571
And then we'll get lunch?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.239
Kristian:
You can pet him
if you want.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.841
Oh!
Ah, no, no.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.709
I, uh,
I just washed my hands.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.712
It's okay.
He's a pushover. Lie down.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.447
It's just, uh, I kind of had
a bad experience as a kid.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.048
A labradoodle took
out part of my calf.

05:51.085 --> 05:53.651
I left a blood trail
three blocks long.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.387
Ha.
That's kind of funny.

05:55.456 --> 05:58.457
Yeah.
No, I-I guess, you know?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.926
I was legally dead for
three minutes, but yeah.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.494
No. I meant you
being scared of dogs

06:03.530 --> 06:05.731
When you're with lara,
a vet.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.565
Just seems like kind of
an important connection

06:07.634 --> 06:08.900
To have with your partner.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.803
We connect in
so many other ways.

06:11.839 --> 06:15.006
Uh, emotionally.
Sexually.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.474
Oh, my god.

06:16.510 --> 06:17.942
Oh, my god,
it's all surface.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.011
Nah, you're fine.
I mean, would she prefer

06:20.147 --> 06:23.481
To be with someone who
shares her passion? Probably.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.883
No, no, no.
You're right.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.686
Can I really be
her soul's true mate

06:27.821 --> 06:29.955
If where she sees affection,

06:30.090 --> 06:32.957
I see teeth, rabies,
and part of my missing calf?

06:32.993 --> 06:35.760
Well, it's something to think
about over lunch with lara.

06:35.763 --> 06:37.963
Ah, wait.
What about the dogs?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.231
Oh, just don't show fear
or too much skin.

06:41.602 --> 06:44.102
(barking)

06:44.104 --> 06:46.571
(growling)

06:46.640 --> 06:48.907
Paul:
Whoa, you look fantastic!

06:48.976 --> 06:51.176
Can't be slumming it
in my ride.

06:51.178 --> 06:54.312
Yeah. I was talking to misty,
but you look pretty good, too.

06:54.348 --> 06:55.379
You named your van?

06:55.416 --> 06:57.148
Every precious thing
deserves a name.

06:57.184 --> 06:58.850
You sound like russ
with his sous vide.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.051
The son he never had.

07:00.087 --> 07:02.320
Yeah, well this van
is like my daughter.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.788
I mean,
I already have a daughter,

07:03.857 --> 07:05.924
But she left and I can't
afford to lose two.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.860
So, no drinking, smoking,
vaping, barfing, food,

07:08.929 --> 07:11.462
Sex, or head on collisions,
please.

07:11.498 --> 07:13.531
Got it.
Don't do anything fun.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.333
Just be careful.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.535
I will.
Oh, you mean your van?

07:17.604 --> 07:20.071
And you. I love you, baby.

07:20.107 --> 07:21.206
Jesus, paul!

07:21.208 --> 07:23.475
She's a collector's item.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.143
I can tell
she's experienced.

07:25.278 --> 07:26.778
Don't be disgusting.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.550
Anyway, I'll send you the new
fundraising targets Friday.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.017
Make sense?

07:33.053 --> 07:34.820
Ross, you gotta stop saying
"make sense" after everything.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.221
It diminishes your power.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.823
Right. Well, I'll send you
the new targets Friday,

07:38.826 --> 07:41.058
So you can suck it up,
short-pants.

07:42.062 --> 07:43.628
Let's find
a balance, 'kay?

07:43.697 --> 07:46.097
Hey, one more thing.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.966
If I were to
ask you for drinks--

07:48.035 --> 07:49.967
I would, but I promised
hugh we'd do f45.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.103
Hugh says
it's better than sex,

07:52.105 --> 07:54.372
But how's that supposed
to make me feel?

07:54.374 --> 07:55.640
No.
I meant hypothetically.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.208
Oh. I mean, you're fun,

07:57.211 --> 07:59.644
But I really just
came by for the update.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.246
And to steal post-its.

08:01.381 --> 08:03.181
I'm probably
overthinking this,

08:03.183 --> 08:05.783
But lara and I had a really
fun time the other night,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.719
But when I asked her to hang
out this week,

08:07.854 --> 08:09.387
She seemed very hesitant.

08:09.389 --> 08:10.388
That woman speaks?

08:10.390 --> 08:11.990
She has literally
never said hello to me.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.658
I saw her say
hello to you yesterday.

08:13.727 --> 08:16.327
Oh. Maybe I'm the one
who never says hello?

08:16.363 --> 08:17.295
I just thought
we connected.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.330
I wouldn't worry about it.
You're her boss.

08:19.366 --> 08:20.565
Weird power dynamic.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.766
You and I hang out.

08:21.768 --> 08:24.869
And it's always
a bit weird.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.739
Besides, lara doesn't really
strike me as a gal's gal.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.207
What?
She loved<i> little women.</i>

08:29.209 --> 08:32.677
Exactly. When the bad skater
burns the old one's books?

08:32.713 --> 08:33.878
Def not a gal's gal.

08:33.947 --> 08:35.680
It was just the first time

08:41.855 --> 08:43.488
It was last night.

08:43.623 --> 08:44.589
Wow.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.024
Yeah.
I'll give it some time.

09:31.605 --> 09:32.837
The strip and bowl?

09:32.873 --> 09:34.538
I was eating, drinking,
and about to hurl.

09:34.575 --> 09:36.207
Misty can thank me later.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.475
She's 16 years old!

09:37.544 --> 09:40.879
Relax. I'll take a cab at lunch
and pick her up.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.014

It's okay.
I'll get paul on that.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.095
What's up?

09:57.164 --> 09:58.763
Uh, joy told me
to give you these.

09:58.832 --> 10:00.965
Ooh. Cost reports.
My fave.

10:00.968 --> 10:02.901
Show me where
the money went.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.404
Yes?

10:06.473 --> 10:09.841
Oh, um, I just wanted to let you
know that I'm really enjoying

10:09.843 --> 10:11.443
My time here.

10:11.445 --> 10:12.677
Aww.
I love to hear that.

10:12.679 --> 10:15.847
It's actually, um-- it's made
me rethink what I want to do

10:15.916 --> 10:17.248
For a living,
but, um, anyway,

10:17.384 --> 10:20.184
If you have any time,
um, I'd love some advice.

10:20.253 --> 10:25.123
Of course.
Mentorship is so important.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.925
What is going on in that
freckled little noggin of yours?

10:27.961 --> 10:30.862
Well, I think that
I'd like to work with,

10:30.931 --> 10:32.530
Uh, special needs dogs.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.399
You know,
not dogs with special needs,

10:34.401 --> 10:36.534
But dogs who help people
with special needs.

10:36.603 --> 10:37.936
That sounds good!

10:37.938 --> 10:39.937
Yeah. Uh, dogs have
been a huge help for me.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.273
Uh, not that I have
special needs or anything,

10:42.342 --> 10:44.342
But, um,
I do have astigmatism.

No, it's just been busy

Keep it down!

10:51.985 --> 10:53.418

10:53.487 --> 10:55.086
Uh, I have astigmatism.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.555
Okay, but before that,
about advice?

10:57.557 --> 10:59.857

I couldn't say no.

I'd like to be a--

Our personalities are
just so different.

11:03.497 --> 11:04.862

11:04.931 --> 11:07.631
Lara:
I mean, it wasn't the worst
but read the room, you know?

11:07.668 --> 11:08.967
What?
Lara: So needy.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.168
Yeah, you're right.
Of course it's not a job.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.704
Maybe this is all stupid.

11:12.839 --> 11:14.605
No, no, no!
That's not what I meant. I--

11:14.675 --> 11:18.042
(clearing throat)
I want to hear all
about your career goals.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.511
Really?
'cause I never share them

11:19.646 --> 11:21.379
'cause I was worried people
would find them boring,

I clearly wasn't into it.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.254
Sorry.
No, no!

11:29.256 --> 11:31.389

have a moment of silence

11:31.524 --> 11:32.590

11:32.726 --> 11:34.992
Lara:
It's just all the chatting.
It's too much.

11:35.062 --> 11:38.062
Mm, maybe I'm being harsh,
but get over it!

11:38.098 --> 11:39.564
You get over it!

11:39.566 --> 11:42.433
Yeah. I'm trying.
Um, but, you're right.

11:42.436 --> 11:43.868
I can be doing better.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.336

with the animals.

more comfortable around dogs.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.368
That's a bit much, but--

12:17.504 --> 12:19.036
First I was terrified,
but then I looked

12:19.038 --> 12:21.172

the eyes and you know what?

12:21.307 --> 12:23.174
Uh, he licked you
and peed on the floor?

12:23.176 --> 12:24.542
I made a new best friend.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.510
Yeah.
Venture's pretty gentle.

12:26.546 --> 12:28.046
Uh, when I said sit,
he sat.

12:28.181 --> 12:29.781
When I said don't sit--
not a command.

12:29.783 --> 12:33.251
He didn't. It's like we're
surfing the same wavelength.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.086
Mm.
Venture! Bark!

12:35.221 --> 12:36.221
(barking)

12:36.223 --> 12:38.589
See?
Yeah, he responds to commands.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.925
It's kind of something that
venture and I worked on.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.994

12:43.063 --> 12:45.463
I am a dog whisperer.

12:45.465 --> 12:47.465

there's a person who spent

12:47.467 --> 12:49.466

comfortable with humans.

12:49.503 --> 12:51.703
Nah, man, it was only,
like, eight minutes!

12:51.705 --> 12:55.139

this whole time is my own power.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.441
Mm.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.276
Sometimes we dim our light
because we don't believe

12:58.278 --> 12:59.477
That we're stars ourselves.

12:59.546 --> 13:02.146
Well, I'm glad
that you connected.

connected to her as her lover.

I heard anything much.

17:06.926 --> 17:09.927
He's been paranoid about
our... Connection lately

17:09.996 --> 17:12.729
And so he's all about
these nightly check-ins.

17:12.766 --> 17:15.800
It's killing me.
Also, here.

17:15.802 --> 17:19.203
A gift card to fondu-rosa's?

17:19.205 --> 17:21.572
Because I ate all your cheese
and drank all your wine.

17:21.608 --> 17:22.940
Again, apologies.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.742
I said things
I wish I hadn't.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.877
It's okay. To be honest,
I was surprised that you

17:26.913 --> 17:28.479
Would wanna hang out with me.

17:28.614 --> 17:30.414
People often find
me dull,

17:30.483 --> 17:31.682
And, as you say, cold.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.717
No. No, no, no. No.

17:33.787 --> 17:38.222
And you seem to have so much
going on, tons of friends.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.058
I do, just not here.

17:40.193 --> 17:41.692
Everyone says they'll
drive to hamilton,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.160
But no one ever does.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.762
It's an hour, people!

17:44.764 --> 17:47.131
And the night that middens
got drunk was such a fun night,

17:47.200 --> 17:49.967
Not because I poisoned him,
but because you came over

17:50.036 --> 17:51.903
And I thought we had
a really good time.

17:52.038 --> 17:55.906
We did, and it was actually
nice to get away from ravi.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.642
Now he wants
to foster a dog,

17:58.678 --> 18:00.845
But I know I will
end up taking care of it.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.179
Oh, I have been there.

18:02.215 --> 18:04.515
You should just tell him that
you wanna focus your energy

18:04.551 --> 18:06.317
On caring for him.
They love that.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.051
Oh! That's good.

18:08.088 --> 18:09.786
Oh, my god.
We're chatting right now,

18:09.823 --> 18:11.455
But keep going, keep going.

18:11.491 --> 18:12.690
That's all I have.

18:12.692 --> 18:15.126
It's a great start.
Gal pals.

18:17.897 --> 18:21.198
Look, just relax.
This is a teaching moment.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.267
I trusted you with
something I care about, nikki.

18:23.269 --> 18:26.337
You can't just park
my wheels anywhere in the city.

18:26.472 --> 18:28.405
Paul, I know.
I made a mistake.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.942
Well, thankfully, I saved
my baby by parking her here.

18:33.246 --> 18:36.480
Oh, wow. You really go
all out when teaching a lesson.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.449
My god!

18:38.518 --> 18:39.851
Who would do this?

18:39.986 --> 18:42.853
This is one of the sketchiest
streets ever, so take your pick.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.956
I just had her repainted!

18:44.958 --> 18:48.092
Whoa!
Sweet boob job, misty.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.861
I'll call an uber.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.766
Plus, the library's
a bit of a hot spot,

18:55.768 --> 18:58.102
So we could always do
a quiet hang in the stacks.

18:58.237 --> 18:59.303
Oh my god.

18:59.372 --> 19:00.471
What is going on?

19:00.540 --> 19:01.439
Ravi:
I'm fine.

19:01.574 --> 19:02.807
I took greta out

19:02.809 --> 19:04.508
And I guess she
took me out, too.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.912
Greta? I love all our animals,
but that dog's a psycho.

19:07.914 --> 19:11.448
Ah, greta's got a good heart
and a strong jaw,

19:11.518 --> 19:12.650
I saw both today.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.585
Greta is way out
of your league!

19:14.587 --> 19:17.722
I can't help but feel
partially responsible.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.657
Dude, all you did
was give me the dog.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.492
You gave him greta?

19:21.561 --> 19:22.927
Okay, I'm fully responsible,

19:22.996 --> 19:24.595
But he said he
was a dog whisperer.

19:24.730 --> 19:26.463
Yeah, that seems
a bit much.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.565
Look, it's all good.

19:27.634 --> 19:30.067
Greta was afraid
and she lashed out.

19:30.203 --> 19:32.737
Who here can say
they've never done that?

19:32.739 --> 19:35.739
I can see why
you love animals, babe.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.609
Also, I really
don't want a dog.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.477
Oh, babe.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.545
Babe.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.181
Babe.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.448
Babe.

19:48.488 --> 19:51.288
Okay, well
I'll leave you to it.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.925
She's not much of a talker.

19:54.060 --> 19:56.693
Kristian:
You should keep
your arm elevated.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.895
That's not what I meant.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.502
Fondu-rosa's added
a gruyere-fontina blend

20:04.637 --> 20:05.903
With strawberry salsa.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.104
Apparently, it's tdf.

20:07.173 --> 20:09.373
Oh, and for dessert we have
to get the classic

20:09.409 --> 20:12.043
Peanut butter fondue topped
with-- right.

20:12.045 --> 20:14.711
Chitty-chatty-shan-shans
has left the building.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.915
Maybe after we could go to
the havana room for live music?

20:18.952 --> 20:21.251
Oh, my god! Yes.

20:21.287 --> 20:22.519
I know the bartender.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.522
Sometimes we do crosswords
together at the bar.

20:24.657 --> 20:26.657
Oh, wow. We're not going
to do that though, right?

20:26.726 --> 20:28.526
Are you guys going for drinks?

20:28.661 --> 20:30.560
Well, dinner first.

20:30.597 --> 20:33.263
Okay.
Have a good time, then.

20:33.299 --> 20:34.531
Joy, would you--

20:34.567 --> 20:37.735
Yes.
Wait, is this a pity invite?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.670
Don't answer.
I'll get my coat.

20:41.874 --> 20:44.942
A little desperate,
but I get it.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.810
I hope this is okay.

20:46.846 --> 20:47.745
Of course.

20:47.880 --> 20:49.880
The more you two talk,
the less I have to.

20:49.882 --> 20:51.281
(chuckling)
that's funny.

20:51.317 --> 20:53.150
That was a joke, right?

20:53.152 --> 20:54.285
Yes.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.219
So, where are we going?

20:56.256 --> 20:57.688
Fondu-rosa's.

20:57.724 --> 21:00.090
I love it!
What is it?

21:00.159 --> 21:01.892
It's a fondue place.

21:01.961 --> 21:03.227
So romantic.

21:03.229 --> 21:04.561
Oh! We should get a booth

21:04.597 --> 21:06.630
And a big drink where
we all share with straws!

21:06.633 --> 21:08.532
(squealing)
oh, my gosh.

21:09.568 --> 21:10.901
She knows this
isn't a date, right?

21:10.903 --> 21:12.570
I don't know what
she thinks this is.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.505
Have you guys seen
<i> sex and the city?</i>

21:14.640 --> 21:16.574
