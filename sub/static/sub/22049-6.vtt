00:02.980 --> 00:05.820
Don't you have siblings?
-My brother studies in Stockholm.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.440
William is a Russ.

00:08.900 --> 00:12.820
When someone becomes a Russ,
they don't want to have a girlfriend.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.340
Everyone knows that.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.760
Say that you don't like me, and I'm gone.

00:16.860 --> 00:19.860
You are so insanely selfish...

00:20.300 --> 00:24.380
... and manipulative and self-involved.

00:24.820 --> 00:26.160
Was that all?

00:53.340 --> 00:55.440
Are you looking at me while I'm sleeping?

00:56.140 --> 00:57.080
No.

01:06.940 --> 01:08.780
Noora Amalie SÃ¦tre

01:10.260 --> 01:11.740
Now you have to be careful.

01:13.880 --> 01:16.240
Because you're going to be so damn in love with me.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.060
I'm not in love with you.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.500
You are in love with me.

01:25.500 --> 01:28.700
You don't even have clothes on.

01:29.500 --> 01:31.460
I do have clothes on!

01:31.720 --> 01:33.820
Give me two weeks and they're gone.

01:34.220 --> 01:36.100
That is not gonna happen.
-It is gonna happen.

01:38.820 --> 01:43.820
I told you that I won't have sex before I get married, right?

01:49.520 --> 01:51.460
Jesus...

01:51.740 --> 01:52.920
It's true!

01:55.120 --> 01:57.220
Okay... We're going to get married then.

01:58.120 --> 01:59.040
Okay...

02:02.260 --> 02:03.000
I mean it.

02:04.480 --> 02:06.240
I can't get married...

02:06.840 --> 02:10.460
... to someone called... Willhelm.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.020
Stop calling me Willhelm.

02:18.060 --> 02:20.000
Oh my, but that's your name.

02:20.580 --> 02:23.140
Is that not what you're called?

02:23.140 --> 02:26.800
Oh that's awkward!
Oops! Oh god.

02:49.000 --> 02:49.980
Where are you going?

02:51.080 --> 02:52.180
I'm going to get water.

02:55.620 --> 02:56.820
There's no water today.

02:57.080 --> 02:58.420
Today we'll just lay here.

02:59.500 --> 03:00.680
We have to go to school.

03:00.820 --> 03:03.940
Not yet.
We'll just lay here a little first.

03:07.180 --> 03:10.520
But I'm thirsty
Shhh...

03:12.860 --> 03:13.700
William!

03:17.560 --> 03:18.860
You can say my name?

03:24.900 --> 03:26.280
Just let me get water.

03:27.160 --> 03:29.180
How do I know you're only going to get water?

03:30.640 --> 03:32.000
Because I say so.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.000
Why should I trust you?

03:35.620 --> 03:39.780
You ran away from me earlier, before I woke up.

03:48.460 --> 03:49.300
Hey you...

03:49.960 --> 03:50.640
Hm?

03:51.200 --> 03:52.780
I'm just going to get water.

03:54.200 --> 03:54.780
I swear.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.060
You have 30 seconds.

04:09.900 --> 04:10.940
I'll keep track of time.

05:11.520 --> 05:12.260
Hi.

05:15.520 --> 05:17.080
Sorry, did I wake you?

05:20.260 --> 05:21.260
No.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.600
Nikolai, William's brother.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.420
Noora.
-Noora, hello!

05:31.840 --> 05:34.020
And there's William! Hello!

05:34.980 --> 05:36.480
Niko, what are you doing here?

05:37.860 --> 05:39.560
I'm cooking.

05:40.800 --> 05:41.960
In Oslo?

05:43.760 --> 05:45.740
Yeah. Needed a little break.

05:48.100 --> 05:48.860
Okay...

05:52.360 --> 05:53.860
Are you perhaps hungry?

05:56.440 --> 05:57.240
No.

05:58.680 --> 05:59.640
No?

05:59.940 --> 06:02.000
Ok. Little rude, right?

06:02.000 --> 06:04.400
Maybe your girlfriend wants something to eat?

06:06.320 --> 06:09.000
She's not my girlfriend and she's leaving now.

06:14.340 --> 06:16.480
Can you find the way out by yourself,
or do you need me to help?

06:21.860 --> 06:22.720
Bye.

06:34.880 --> 06:36.740
Was it a bad vibe, or?

06:38.620 --> 06:39.900
No, she's nothing.

06:40.820 --> 06:41.980
What are you making?

06:49.620 --> 06:51.920
Damn, terrible pictures.

06:52.440 --> 06:54.360
It looks so painful!

06:54.520 --> 06:55.960
I'm getting chills.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.460
It's my fault.

06:59.060 --> 07:02.860
Had it not been for me,
Jonas would have never started fighting with him.

07:04.720 --> 07:08.140
I didn't even know he was with Yakuza.

07:08.580 --> 07:14.500
He isn't with them.
But he's friends with quite a lot of them.

07:14.660 --> 07:17.560
The Yakuza-guys are just looking for people to beat up.

07:18.080 --> 07:22.000
He has to do something.
The Yakuza-guys have too much power.

07:22.400 --> 07:28.260
They can't do anything.
Won't they just fight each other forever?

07:29.020 --> 07:31.540
Noora, you have such good morals.

07:36.760 --> 07:40.280
No, but I mean it.
I really look up to you.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.500
Thanks.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.920
How is Jonas doing?

07:49.340 --> 07:52.000
He's still ignoring me.

07:54.640 --> 07:59.680
It's Isabel. She's the one who told him
he can't talk to me.

08:00.640 --> 08:05.220
She seems really bossy.
As if she has him on a leash.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.580
Smart of her.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.300
Why is that?

08:12.060 --> 08:13.980
To keep him away from you.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.800
I'm not going to sleep with Jonas.

08:20.180 --> 08:22.680
No, but you always feel something for your ex.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.080
You hold the advantage.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.180
How?

08:27.420 --> 08:29.060
You're not together with him anymore.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.900
How is that an advantage?

08:32.160 --> 08:38.180
When a boy is together with a girl,
suddenly all the others seem more exciting.

08:38.640 --> 08:39.800
Seriously?

08:39.900 --> 08:40.680
Yes.

08:40.780 --> 08:42.840
Boys are naturally like that.

08:43.040 --> 08:46.820
Guys' instict is to spread their genes as much as possible.

08:47.140 --> 08:48.900
That's why guys sleep around.

08:49.220 --> 08:52.800
If you want to hold on to a guy...

08:53.340 --> 08:55.680
You have to make sure his needs are covered

08:55.960 --> 08:58.000
And keep others at a distance.

08:58.560 --> 09:00.780
Isabel is just trying to be his girlfriend.

09:00.960 --> 09:02.460
Can't blame her for that.

09:04.320 --> 09:08.500
Enough about spreading genes.. Anyone else excited
about the start of Russetiden this Friday?

10:02.920 --> 10:04.040
Nice lipstick.

10:05.980 --> 10:06.760
Thanks.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.800
Where is it from?

10:11.160 --> 10:12.640
Clinique, I believe.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.060
It suits you.
Really sexy.

10:38.700 --> 10:39.800
You're ignoring me.

10:40.000 --> 10:44.000
William, you can't talk to me here!

10:44.300 --> 10:46.120
I have to... when you're not answering your phone.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.580
I have math now.

10:51.520 --> 10:52.780
We have to talk first.

10:53.440 --> 10:54.920
Well, then talk!

10:57.720 --> 10:59.820
That stuff yesterday didn't have anything to do with you.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.360
It did have something to do with me.
You treated me like crap.

11:05.220 --> 11:07.900
The thing is that my brother was dumped by his girlfriend.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.040
They were together for years.

11:16.780 --> 11:18.260
He's really depressed.

11:18.340 --> 11:19.380
So what?

11:20.460 --> 11:22.500
It didn't feel right to introduce you.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.260
And to rub it in.
-Rub in what?

11:29.420 --> 11:30.420
Us.

11:41.220 --> 11:42.100
I'm sorry.

11:45.780 --> 11:48.140
I'm just really bad at that kind of stuff.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.620
Hey you...

11:58.160 --> 11:59.880
I didn't mean to hurt you.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.000
You didn't hurt me!

12:03.700 --> 12:05.960
I'm not hurt even a little bit.

12:07.040 --> 12:07.880
Okay...

12:16.660 --> 12:19.180
I just think you were a real asshole.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.760
Yeah I agree. I was an asshole.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.880
It won't happen again.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.060
I promise.

12:45.920 --> 12:48.320
It was actually really good that it happened.

12:50.240 --> 12:55.760
I was afraid that you would go around thinking we were a couple.

12:56.640 --> 13:01.580
But then at least I don't have to be afraid of that now.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.460
We are together, though.

13:12.220 --> 13:13.140
No.

13:19.700 --> 13:21.360
Yes we are.

13:38.940 --> 13:40.700
You have to fix your hair.

14:28.760 --> 14:31.620
Those girls are so scary.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.860
Should I delete the picture, Sana?

14:37.000 --> 14:37.800
No.

14:38.620 --> 14:39.780
What picture?

14:44.360 --> 14:53.680
<i>(My pillow smells of you.
I had a dream about you last night)</i>

14:53.880 --> 14:56.100
Don't delete the picture.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.340
<i>(Did you get up? What did you dream?)</i>

15:08.080 --> 15:15.500
<i>(That we had sex)</i>

15:15.920 --> 15:19.060
<i>(You were so delicious)</i>

15:19.620 --> 15:21.740
Did you just go and work out? During lunch break?

15:22.120 --> 15:25.680
Russetiden season is approaching.
And bikini season.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.860
Is anyone looking forward to the Penetrator concept?

15:29.340 --> 15:31.300
I bet it's something kinky.

15:32.260 --> 15:35.520
I wonder how many girls William will sleep with during Russetiden.

15:36.560 --> 15:39.980
Is it okay with you that he's going to sleep with lots of girls?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.980
Are you jealous?

15:42.600 --> 15:45.240
No, I just have to accept it.

15:46.560 --> 15:51.040
He has been working towards this for 3 years.
It's the most important time in his life.

15:52.740 --> 15:58.400
I wonder if he will beat his brother's record.
He slept with 130 girls during his Russetiden.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.060
He has a brother?

16:01.040 --> 16:05.280
Yes, Nico. From '95.
He left Nissen 2 years ago.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.060
A true fuckboy.

16:09.580 --> 16:11.840
So there are two of them?

16:12.880 --> 16:19.620
My sister studies in Stockholm with him.
She told me he gave half the Stureplan chlamydia.

16:19.900 --> 16:20.980
Seriously?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.140
That's really nasty.

16:23.560 --> 16:25.580
The Magnusson brothers...

16:26.380 --> 16:29.640
"Begge samma ulla, alle skall bli knulla"

16:32.460 --> 16:34.920
It's the Karpe Diem song.

16:47.660 --> 16:50.500
This here is not going to work!

16:51.840 --> 16:52.520
What's up?

16:52.880 --> 16:57.940
If you want to sleep with loads of girls
during Russetiden, then that's totally fine.

16:58.300 --> 17:05.400
But if you think I'm just going to sit at home and wait for you,
then you're wrong.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.560
Where is this coming from?

17:09.640 --> 17:12.320
You're going to be sleeping around.

17:14.280 --> 17:16.380
Okay, then you know more than me.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.500
Yeah, you know what?
Your brother never had a girlfriend.

17:19.620 --> 17:23.620
That he was "terribly depressed"
was just bullshit!

17:26.540 --> 17:28.280
Yeah true, that was bullshit.

17:29.900 --> 17:31.360
So you lied?

17:32.920 --> 17:33.580
Yes.

17:34.540 --> 17:35.800
Why?

17:38.460 --> 17:43.620
Because you were wondering why I behaved
like that in front of my brother.

17:45.360 --> 17:47.600
Then what's the truth?

17:48.140 --> 17:50.800
You don't always tell the truth either.

17:52.180 --> 17:55.360
But that's to protect Vilde.

17:55.560 --> 17:59.040
I do it to protect you.
What's the difference?

17:59.760 --> 18:04.000
The difference is that I don't need to be protected.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.820
Have you asked Vilde if she wants to be protected?

18:15.100 --> 18:17.080
Noora what is this really about?

18:18.500 --> 18:21.800
Do you really think I worked so hard to be together with you

18:22.100 --> 18:26.340
if I was going to sleep with loads of random girls during Russetiden?

18:27.200 --> 18:28.780
Isn't that illogical?

18:37.780 --> 18:39.820
No but... that's not what it's about.

18:39.860 --> 18:41.800
How do I get to know you then?

18:42.760 --> 18:45.180
How can I trust you?

18:46.020 --> 18:49.520
When you don't even want me to meet your family?

18:54.180 --> 18:57.360
You don't need to know my family to know me.

19:02.300 --> 19:03.820
What about your family?

19:05.600 --> 19:08.280
You've never even talked about them.

19:08.680 --> 19:11.680
Oh we can talk about my family!

19:11.900 --> 19:14.360
I am an unplanned only child.

19:14.460 --> 19:17.840
My mom is a sexologist,
my dad is a psychologist.

19:19.420 --> 19:24.220
They never loved me. They were only concerned about
one another and their sex life.

19:25.380 --> 19:32.040
I come from a shit town called MjÃ¸ndalen,
and fled as soon as I was 15. Fled to Madrid.

19:33.180 --> 19:35.360
I talk to them once a month.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.520
They are happy without me.
I am happy without them.

19:39.540 --> 19:40.980
I don't have siblings.

19:42.660 --> 19:44.660
I already told you that, so.

19:45.760 --> 19:46.660
Your turn.

19:49.700 --> 19:52.040
I actually have a hard time believing that.

19:53.140 --> 19:55.020
That they don't love you?

19:59.620 --> 20:01.520
That's practically impossible.

20:13.520 --> 20:15.320
It's your turn.

20:34.580 --> 20:35.520
Hey you...

20:40.000 --> 20:40.840
Look at me.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.320
I realise that it may be difficult to trust me.

21:00.000 --> 21:01.880
That I can't tell you everything.

21:05.400 --> 21:07.220
But I don't want to hurt you.

21:12.420 --> 21:13.680
I swear.

21:19.920 --> 21:26.100
If you really want to meet my brother
I'll introduce you to him.

21:28.380 --> 21:29.440
Okay?

21:38.700 --> 21:39.740
Yes.

21:58.260 --> 22:00.120
Maybe that wasn't so crazy.

22:09.140 --> 22:11.300
Are that Chris and Isak?

22:19.980 --> 22:20.940
Isak?

22:22.260 --> 22:25.240
Yeah, he's in the first year.

22:27.600 --> 22:28.480
Okay.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.820
Isn't that a little strange?

22:38.300 --> 22:42.400
I just didn't know they knew each other.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.540
Same.
