00:03.657 --> 00:05.887
What's a four-letter word
for "nonsense"?

00:06.059 --> 00:08.527
- Bull.
- Thanks.

00:09.329 --> 00:11.888
- Mind if we join you?
- No. Sit down.

00:12.064 --> 00:14.328
Selma, you haven't touched your food.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.401
I've touched it. I've chewed it.
I've swallowed it.

00:17.570 --> 00:20.562
Now it's up to my enzymes.

00:20.973 --> 00:23.167
That's the judge's tray.
He's on the phone.

00:23.341 --> 00:24.933
Got another lead on those tickets.

00:25.377 --> 00:29.211
I must say, I've never seen anybody
so whipped up about a concert.

00:29.381 --> 00:31.713
Well, you know how he is
about Mel Torme.

00:31.883 --> 00:33.475
Bonkers.

00:33.652 --> 00:35.209
It fits.

00:35.386 --> 00:38.082
Personally, I don't see the big
attraction about Mel Torme.

00:38.255 --> 00:40.086
I like singers that stick to the tune.

00:40.257 --> 00:41.815
Like who, for instance?

00:41.992 --> 00:43.323
Leontyne Price...

00:43.494 --> 00:45.860
...Luciano Pavarotti...

00:46.029 --> 00:48.930
<i>...that bird on Sesame Street's
not bad either.</i>

00:51.467 --> 00:52.832
- Any luck?
- Yeah. All bad.

00:53.002 --> 00:55.027
The concert's been sold out
for two weeks...

00:55.204 --> 00:57.035
...and my sources don't have tickets.

00:57.206 --> 01:00.140
I don't believe it. I am two days
away from getting shut out.

01:00.308 --> 01:02.333
It's only a concert, judge.

01:02.744 --> 01:05.406
No, Liz. Woodstock was only a concert.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.445
This is Mel Torme.

01:07.816 --> 01:09.545
Yeah, I'm into financial planning.

01:09.718 --> 01:13.084
I make money the old-fashioned way.
I print it.

01:13.254 --> 01:16.849
- Dan, you're a very funny guy.
- Yes. Well...

01:17.024 --> 01:19.390
...I have my serious side too.

01:19.560 --> 01:21.858
Unhand me, sir. I'll scream.

01:22.029 --> 01:25.930
You'll scream. You'll faint.
You'll see skyrockets going off.

01:26.766 --> 01:28.859
Is it me, or has Dan
been different lately?

01:29.035 --> 01:31.196
No. He's always been different.

01:32.539 --> 01:34.665
You think there's been a little...

01:34.840 --> 01:36.307
...between them?
- Come on, now.

01:36.475 --> 01:39.774
Just because people work together
and have coffee breaks together...

01:39.945 --> 01:41.469
...and laughs, don't jump to...

01:41.647 --> 01:45.139
Don't look now.
He's kissing her hand.

01:46.351 --> 01:49.945
Listen, you lured me in here
with the promise of a cup of coffee.

01:50.121 --> 01:52.316
- Any chance of getting one?
- That's the spirit.

01:52.490 --> 01:54.458
Use me.

01:57.862 --> 02:00.830
- Look at that man smile.
- It's cute.

02:00.997 --> 02:05.832
It's dangerous. Your teeth dry up
and stick to your lips.

02:06.269 --> 02:08.532
Very painful.

02:10.507 --> 02:13.202
- Hey, Dan, over here.
- Dan.

02:13.375 --> 02:16.640
Dan, I think the others
want us to join them.

02:16.812 --> 02:18.871
- Come over.
- Come on over, Dan.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.347
I don't see anyone.

02:22.518 --> 02:25.418
I think you might be right.
It looks like our Dan is in love.

02:25.587 --> 02:27.214
Incredible!

02:27.388 --> 02:29.822
That's it. "Incredible."
How many letters?

02:30.892 --> 02:32.120
Ten.

02:34.129 --> 02:35.857
Close enough.

02:37.000 --> 02:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:20.271 --> 03:24.468
Has anyone ever told you what
a cute vaccination scar you have?

03:25.575 --> 03:28.043
Not that I recall.

03:28.611 --> 03:30.943
Well, if it isn't two of
the loveliest ladies...

03:31.114 --> 03:33.048
...in the entire criminal justice system.

03:33.216 --> 03:34.478
Hi.

03:34.884 --> 03:37.374
- Dan?
- Dan Fielding?

03:37.553 --> 03:40.750
Liz, that may be the smartest
outfit I've ever seen you wear...

03:40.923 --> 03:43.357
...and you have worn
some smart outfits.

03:43.525 --> 03:48.587
- I have?
- Don't you dare change that hair.

03:53.167 --> 03:57.763
Remember that movie about the pods
in the basement?

04:00.407 --> 04:01.635
Here.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.070
What's this?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.143
A poem I wrote on the subway
this morning.

04:05.312 --> 04:06.540
Oh?

04:10.383 --> 04:11.679
What do you think?

04:12.518 --> 04:14.213
Nice.

04:14.386 --> 04:18.447
Must be hard to find something
to rhyme with "jurisprudence."

04:20.024 --> 04:22.516
Looks like love is in
full bloom over there.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.595
The massive amounts of fertilizer
have helped, I think.

04:25.763 --> 04:27.924
- Come on, Miss Wagner.
- Don't be so hard on him.

04:28.099 --> 04:30.499
Haven't you ever been
madly in love with someone?

04:30.668 --> 04:33.432
Of course not. I'm engaged.

04:33.605 --> 04:36.232
What I mean is, I don't think
that it's appropriate...

04:36.406 --> 04:38.567
...for people who work together
to have...

04:38.742 --> 04:41.267
...romantic relationships.

04:41.979 --> 04:43.844
- Have you?
- Have I what?

04:44.014 --> 04:46.244
Have you ever been
madly in love with someone?

04:46.416 --> 04:48.349
- Sure.
- Anyone I know?

04:48.517 --> 04:50.610
I doubt it. She was
a cute dark-haired girl...

04:50.786 --> 04:52.617
...who sat next to me
in second grade.

04:52.788 --> 04:55.382
- I see.
- I forget her name, but she was wild.

04:55.558 --> 04:57.025
- Your Honor...
- We'd sneak off...

04:57.193 --> 05:00.423
...to the cloakroom and eat paste.
- Next case.

05:00.829 --> 05:03.024
You see, in our version of hide-and-seek...

05:03.198 --> 05:05.029
<i>The People v. Leo Bell, Your Honor.</i>

05:05.200 --> 05:07.828
Mr. Bell was arrested near
Madison Square Garden...

05:08.003 --> 05:09.300
...for scalping tickets.

05:09.471 --> 05:12.633
Hey, I'm very distraught
about this whole thing, judge.

05:12.806 --> 05:14.671
See, I made my little niece a promise:

05:14.842 --> 05:18.938
The next time the ice show comes to town,
her Uncle Leo would take her.

05:19.113 --> 05:22.879
But then two weeks ago,
something else took her.

05:23.050 --> 05:25.449
- I'm sorry. You mean...?
- She went with the school...

05:25.618 --> 05:28.109
...and I got stuck
with the ticket, right.

05:28.688 --> 05:30.485
You thought you might sell the ticket?

05:30.657 --> 05:32.090
Exactly.

05:32.258 --> 05:35.159
So someone else's niece
could enjoy the show.

05:35.328 --> 05:37.989
That is a very nice thought, Mr. Bell,
but it says here...

05:38.163 --> 05:41.030
...that you sold a $9 ticket for $45.

05:41.199 --> 05:44.362
Well, that seat was right behind
Snoopy's doghouse.

05:45.904 --> 05:49.339
If it please the court, Exhibit A
was taken from the defendant...

05:49.507 --> 05:51.771
...at the time of his arrest.

05:52.643 --> 05:55.908
I couldn't have said it better myself.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.344
Well, how do you explain this, Mr. Bell?

05:58.516 --> 06:00.380
You must have 200 or 300 tickets here.

06:01.184 --> 06:03.084
I love the theater.

06:03.954 --> 06:07.651
Your appreciation of the arts
is duly noted for the record.

06:07.824 --> 06:13.056
- Your hair smells great.
- It's dandruff shampoo.

06:14.496 --> 06:17.556
Excuse me, does the prosecution
have anything else to present?

06:17.733 --> 06:19.758
- Your Honor...
- Your Honor... Sorry, go ahead.

06:19.935 --> 06:21.800
No, no. After you.

06:22.538 --> 06:25.233
Mr. Bell is so brazen
in his flaunting of the law...

06:25.406 --> 06:28.534
...that he prints business cards
listing his office phone number...

06:28.710 --> 06:31.975
...which is, in fact, a phone booth
on Lexington Avenue.

06:34.048 --> 06:36.948
This is quite an assortment
you have here, Mr. Bell:

06:37.117 --> 06:41.611
<i>The Knicks, the Rangers, the boat show,
La Cage aux Folles, Mel...</i>

06:42.856 --> 06:45.723
...Torme?

06:45.892 --> 06:48.860
There must be 30 Mel Torme tickets here.

06:49.028 --> 06:54.091
I had 50 Tormes this morning.
That is a very hot ticket.

06:55.368 --> 06:58.769
- Your Honor.
- September 13.

06:58.938 --> 07:00.962
- Beg your pardon?
- That's when Mel Torme...

07:01.139 --> 07:03.039
...was born in Chicago.

07:03.208 --> 07:05.176
- I celebrate it every year.
- Your Honor...

07:05.343 --> 07:08.403
I mean, I don't have a big affair.
It's not a national holiday...

07:08.580 --> 07:10.013
...not yet.

07:10.548 --> 07:12.243
Sir, the case.

07:12.417 --> 07:15.647
- Is open-and-shut, right, Leo?
- I have erred.

07:15.819 --> 07:17.309
Forgive me.

07:17.488 --> 07:19.922
Fifty dollars penance.

07:20.090 --> 07:21.557
Go in peace.

07:22.259 --> 07:24.318
I like him. He's nuts.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.185
Let's have a recess.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.796
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

07:28.965 --> 07:31.058
Your thinking was clear,
your logic, precise.

07:31.234 --> 07:33.862
You're a credit to the profession.
Let's have children.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.939
- Oh, Dan.
- Oh, Suzanne.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.872
- Harry, they're evidence.
- Of course.

07:45.047 --> 07:47.481
I have to turn them over
to the city property clerk.

07:47.649 --> 07:50.082
- Absolutely. That's the law.
- Right.

07:51.085 --> 07:54.077
Oh, God. Row B.

07:59.293 --> 08:01.590
- Your Honor?
- Miss Woodfield?

08:01.761 --> 08:04.423
I'm sorry, but I couldn't
help overhearing, and...

08:04.898 --> 08:07.423
...well, I have two tickets
to the Mel Torme concert.

08:07.600 --> 08:10.933
- You're not using them? Fantastic!
- No. I'm using them...

08:11.104 --> 08:13.401
At least one of them.
See, I'm a big fan too.

08:13.572 --> 08:15.540
- Really?
- I wondered if you might wanna...

08:15.707 --> 08:18.005
...use the other ticket.
- But what about Dan?

08:18.444 --> 08:22.039
- What about him?
- I assumed you two were...

08:22.214 --> 08:25.410
Oh, no, no. I mean, he's a very nice guy.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.108
We've gone out a couple of times,
but it's not serious.

08:28.286 --> 08:30.880
- Well, in that case...
- You'll go with me?

08:31.055 --> 08:34.388
I would go with Godzilla.

08:37.159 --> 08:40.061
I have better breath.

08:40.230 --> 08:43.198
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

08:43.366 --> 08:45.027
Your Honor...

08:45.202 --> 08:47.329
...is she adorable or what?

08:47.504 --> 08:49.199
The court agrees, Mr. Fielding.

08:49.371 --> 08:52.807
I'll tell you what. After work
why don't we go get pizza. My treat.

08:52.975 --> 08:54.272
I'd love to, but I can't.

08:54.443 --> 08:56.377
I'm already doing something this evening.

08:56.545 --> 08:58.843
Yeah. We're already doing
something this evening.

08:59.014 --> 09:01.811
What exactly will we be doing this evening?

09:01.983 --> 09:03.883
Sorry, Dan. I have a date.

09:04.052 --> 09:07.180
A couple of the gals are getting together,
doing their nails.

09:07.355 --> 09:10.119
- That kind of thing?
- No. It's a date.

09:12.594 --> 09:14.754
With a man?

09:14.928 --> 09:16.327
Are you serious?

09:16.497 --> 09:18.362
Deadly. Who are you going out with?

09:18.532 --> 09:20.557
- None of your business.
- Come on. Tell me.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.066
- I won't die.
- Excuse me.

09:23.237 --> 09:26.535
Shall I pick you up at your house,
or should we just leave from here?

09:28.908 --> 09:30.398
Him?!

09:31.144 --> 09:33.203
Could we discuss this
somewhere else, Bull?

09:33.379 --> 09:35.540
Excuse us.

09:40.452 --> 09:41.749
Dan?

09:43.054 --> 09:44.578
Dan, I didn't know.

09:44.756 --> 09:46.917
I didn't know that you
and Suzanne were serious.

09:47.092 --> 09:50.322
- I just thought that...
- Harry, stuff it.

09:53.397 --> 09:55.831
- I can't believe he said that.
- No, it's okay.

09:56.000 --> 09:58.093
I told him he could call me "Harry."

10:04.407 --> 10:07.069
I have never known Dan to be late before.

10:07.243 --> 10:10.508
- I hope he's all right.
- Yeah. But it's his own fault.

10:10.680 --> 10:15.309
I mean, I always make it a rule: Never get
involved with people I work with.

10:16.118 --> 10:19.815
You work with rapists, junkies,
muggers and flashers.

10:22.124 --> 10:24.285
That does make it easier.

10:27.361 --> 10:30.262
- Hi, Dan. How was dinner?
- The part that stayed down? Fine.

10:30.431 --> 10:31.796
Dan.

10:32.967 --> 10:35.162
Dan, I've gotta talk to you
about something.

10:35.336 --> 10:36.928
- Business?
- No.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.264
Catch me in the fall.

10:40.140 --> 10:43.303
- Dan, can we talk?
- Sure.

10:45.979 --> 10:49.540
So where are you and Conehead
the Barbarian going tonight?

10:52.084 --> 10:54.211
Dan, it is just a dinner date.

10:54.386 --> 10:56.786
Foraging in the forest,
trapping small animals...

10:56.956 --> 10:58.253
...that kind of thing?

10:58.924 --> 11:01.324
If you must know, he's taking me
to the restaurant...

11:01.493 --> 11:03.619
...on top of
the World Trade Center.

11:04.495 --> 11:06.258
Are you going to use the elevator...

11:06.431 --> 11:09.195
...or is he just dragging you
up the side of the building?

11:11.302 --> 11:13.463
- Poor guy.
- Yeah.

11:13.638 --> 11:15.298
I'm sure he presumed way too much...

11:15.472 --> 11:17.997
...but he must feel like he's been
kicked in the teeth.

11:18.175 --> 11:20.871
- Well...
- I'm sure that to feel that a friend...

11:21.044 --> 11:23.205
...has stabbed you in the heart...
- But...

11:23.380 --> 11:27.315
- Betrayal eats away so...
- I didn't know!

11:28.451 --> 11:31.443
That we were getting so backed up!

11:31.621 --> 11:33.452
Next case!

11:33.623 --> 11:36.490
That would be Gerald Jackson,
Your Honor...

11:36.659 --> 11:38.751
...charged with theft, second-degree.

11:38.927 --> 11:42.886
He was accused of tapping the till of
his employer, the Midtown Speedy Mart.

11:43.064 --> 11:44.964
- Miss Williams?
- Yes, sir. Your Honor...

11:45.133 --> 11:47.465
...the amount of money
is less than $50...

11:47.636 --> 11:50.366
...and my client has expressed
willingness to pay it back.

11:50.537 --> 11:52.095
Pay it back?

11:52.806 --> 11:56.537
How do you pay back someone's trust
once you've spent it?

11:56.710 --> 11:59.804
- Mr. Fielding...
- Look at it from my point of view.

11:59.980 --> 12:03.142
I was nuts about her. No.
Scratch that. Insane about her.

12:03.316 --> 12:06.547
I gave her all of my love, all of my
attention, all of my affection...

12:06.719 --> 12:08.311
...and what happens?
She dumps me...

12:08.488 --> 12:11.150
...for Bobbo the Human Redwood
over there.

12:15.193 --> 12:17.093
- I don't feel well.
- I know, Dan...

12:17.262 --> 12:19.127
...but we have to put
personal problems...

12:19.298 --> 12:22.756
- I am going to soil your bench.
- Recess now.

12:26.538 --> 12:29.028
Dan, we've all been through rejection.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.674
Hasn't anything like this
ever happened to you before?

12:31.842 --> 12:33.070
Are you serious?

12:33.244 --> 12:38.011
Harry, I was just jilted in favor of a man
who wears hunting socks to work every day.

12:38.882 --> 12:41.407
Now, be fair.
Bull has his share of talents.

12:41.584 --> 12:45.543
I don't consider being able to drive in
nails with your fists a talent.

12:46.356 --> 12:49.792
Dan, Suzanne appears to be
a wonderful woman.

12:49.959 --> 12:53.325
You know, I really, really thought
that we were simpatico, Harry.

12:53.495 --> 12:54.985
She appeals to a lot of people.

12:55.164 --> 12:57.189
We shared so many of the same interests.

12:57.366 --> 12:59.266
I imagine a lot of people appeal to her.

12:59.435 --> 13:00.959
She found my jokes amusing.

13:01.136 --> 13:03.365
She likes Torme. I like Torme.

13:03.538 --> 13:05.836
Her nose wrinkles when she laughs at them.

13:06.007 --> 13:08.567
- Harry, Suzanne and l...
- Suzanne and l...

13:08.743 --> 13:10.267
Go ahead.

13:10.445 --> 13:13.346
Dan, I'm gonna go...

13:13.715 --> 13:15.443
Answer the door.

13:17.517 --> 13:19.747
- Bull.
- Your Honor.

13:20.754 --> 13:22.619
<i>You're ocupado.</i>

13:27.193 --> 13:28.683
- I'll come back.
- No, no.

13:28.861 --> 13:30.692
Come on in. Come on in.

13:30.863 --> 13:33.093
I think we have something
to talk about.

13:34.500 --> 13:35.728
What?

13:36.335 --> 13:39.303
The year in combs.
You ever see one up close?

13:41.339 --> 13:44.240
Listen, you myopic little dilettante!

13:45.243 --> 13:47.302
Who are you calling little?!

13:47.479 --> 13:48.810
Okay, that is enough of that.

13:48.980 --> 13:51.607
I won't tolerate personal
disagreements that interfere...

13:51.782 --> 13:55.240
...with the operation of my court.
Do I make myself clear?

13:55.719 --> 13:59.086
Now, the three of us have a problem.
We must work it out like grown men.

13:59.256 --> 14:02.555
- The three of us?
- Yeah. We all...

14:03.926 --> 14:07.453
Anybody want pretzels?
Or nuts? I got some avocado dip.

14:07.630 --> 14:09.427
Your Honor, I have cases to prepare.

14:09.599 --> 14:13.091
Why don't you just sit down
until you're told to leave?

14:14.937 --> 14:17.029
You talking to me?

14:18.840 --> 14:21.502
- Guys.
- Perhaps you'd like to step outside.

14:21.843 --> 14:23.708
- You bet I would.
- All right, that's it.

14:23.879 --> 14:26.973
- Nobody leaves here.
- Thank you. Thank you.

14:31.485 --> 14:34.818
Now, we got to find a way
to cut this tension.

14:37.191 --> 14:39.886
Let's hold hands.

14:42.595 --> 14:44.062
What did he say?

14:44.230 --> 14:46.357
I took a sensitivity training
class once...

14:46.533 --> 14:49.093
...and I learned that most male
aggression is due to...

14:49.269 --> 14:51.396
...a lack of physical
and emotional contact...

14:51.571 --> 14:53.299
...with members of the same sex.

14:53.472 --> 14:56.964
Perhaps you should visit
our holding cell sometime, sir.

14:57.142 --> 14:59.804
Come on. You've seen
professional football huddles...

14:59.978 --> 15:03.209
...haven't you? Come on. Come on.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.080
That's it.

15:08.019 --> 15:10.010
Dan, take my hand.

15:11.589 --> 15:14.149
Good. Now, Bull.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.584
All right, now the two of you link up.

15:18.195 --> 15:19.685
Go ahead.

15:22.065 --> 15:24.226
That's it.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.232
No.

15:26.403 --> 15:28.063
I wanna be on top.

15:32.908 --> 15:35.638
Okay, guys.
Now, no need to say anything.

15:35.811 --> 15:38.405
Just let go.

15:38.581 --> 15:41.743
Just feel, experience the bond.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.942
His bond is breaking my knuckles.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.516
Bull, loosen up.

15:48.690 --> 15:51.659
Come on now, guys, relax.
Close your eyes.

15:52.426 --> 15:54.087
All the way.

15:55.362 --> 15:59.162
All right. Now just...

15:59.333 --> 16:01.062
...feel.

16:04.737 --> 16:07.638
Someone came in.

16:07.807 --> 16:09.331
- Hello?
- We'll come back.

16:09.509 --> 16:11.704
- No, no. Don't be silly.
- We were...

16:11.878 --> 16:14.472
...just discussing humiliation.

16:14.647 --> 16:15.875
If you'll all excuse me.

16:16.048 --> 16:18.345
Dan, there is no reason
to feel humiliated.

16:18.517 --> 16:22.180
Some helpful advice:
Date within your species.

16:23.922 --> 16:26.914
I have no idea what she sees in him.

16:27.959 --> 16:31.223
Don't worry.
Women are still tops in my book.

16:32.863 --> 16:35.991
We were just trying
a little sensitivity exercise.

16:36.166 --> 16:38.225
- Just say, "Of course."
- Of course.

16:38.402 --> 16:39.630
Did you want to see me?

16:39.803 --> 16:42.032
Yes. Harry, we're ready
for you anytime you are.

16:42.205 --> 16:43.729
- Fine.
- And I want to apologize...

16:43.907 --> 16:45.374
...for what happened in court.

16:45.542 --> 16:48.409
- I feel partly responsible.
- No, it wasn't your fault.

16:48.578 --> 16:52.513
It's just that Dan needs to realize
that I care as much for him as I do for Bull.

16:52.681 --> 16:54.979
It just so happens
I have a lot of interests.

16:55.150 --> 16:57.675
- Fine.
- Bull likes Post-lmpressionist painters.

16:57.853 --> 16:59.445
- So do I.
- He does?

16:59.621 --> 17:02.556
- Dan enjoys oompah bands. So do I.
- He does.

17:02.724 --> 17:05.385
You and I love Mel Torme,
so we're going to the concert...

17:05.560 --> 17:08.529
...just to have a good time.
- You are?

17:09.664 --> 17:13.828
- Lana, you wanna hear a funny story?
- Yeah. Make me laugh.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.732
Your Honor, you better hurry. It's bad.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.428
- What happened? Bad?
- Bull and Dan in the cafeteria...

17:19.606 --> 17:21.233
...they are fighting.
- Fighting?!

17:21.407 --> 17:24.502
I passed by. Bull was throwing
Dan around like a little rag doll.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.305
- Oh, my God!
- Those stupid...!

17:26.479 --> 17:29.311
- Are they fighting over me?
- Chivalry is not dead.

17:29.481 --> 17:30.743
Let's go.

17:33.619 --> 17:35.109
No. Dan!

17:35.287 --> 17:38.051
He was lucky there was a doctor here.

17:39.325 --> 17:40.815
Look at this place!

17:40.992 --> 17:42.687
Love stinks.

17:43.394 --> 17:46.921
- Is he all right, doctor?
- Couple of cracked ribs, that's all.

17:47.098 --> 17:49.828
You big, overgrown oaf!
How could you?!

17:50.001 --> 17:53.163
Settle down there, Your Honor.
He probably saved this man's life.

17:53.337 --> 17:55.669
- Come again?
- Your friend here almost choked...

17:55.839 --> 17:58.239
...to death on an olive
that got stuck in his throat.

17:58.408 --> 18:01.434
- You mean Bull?
- Applied the Heimlich maneuver...

18:01.612 --> 18:04.410
...with ferocity heretofore
unknown to mankind.

18:06.482 --> 18:08.712
Dan, how do you feel?

18:09.285 --> 18:11.378
Take a guess.

18:12.388 --> 18:14.288
Bull saved your life.

18:14.457 --> 18:15.890
I know.

18:16.058 --> 18:17.285
Bull?

18:20.895 --> 18:24.194
- Yeah?
- Thank you.

18:24.366 --> 18:27.233
Bull, I am so sorry
for what I thought and what I said.

18:27.836 --> 18:30.827
That enough manly affection
for you, Your Honor?

18:31.972 --> 18:33.269
I deserved that.

18:33.440 --> 18:37.376
- Any bandages or tape around here?
- In the guard's lounge. Follow me.

18:37.544 --> 18:39.273
Now, just keep still.

18:39.446 --> 18:41.709
And please, no more help.

18:43.516 --> 18:46.747
Bull, I said some pretty nasty things.

18:46.919 --> 18:51.185
- You didn't say anything that nasty.
- Not to your face, no.

18:52.191 --> 18:53.555
Well, forget it.

18:53.725 --> 18:57.525
No, no! I don't wanna forget it.
I want a chance to make it up to you.

18:57.696 --> 18:58.924
So...

19:00.332 --> 19:03.233
...you can have Suzanne.

19:04.236 --> 19:05.702
He what?

19:05.870 --> 19:08.270
No, Dan, I mean, you were
there first. I had no idea.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.997
- You should have her.
- No, no, no.

19:10.174 --> 19:12.472
- I insist.
- You insist?!

19:12.643 --> 19:15.111
- Listen...
- My ribs, my ribs!

19:17.714 --> 19:20.114
For your information, boys...

19:20.283 --> 19:22.649
...l'm not a plaything
to be tossed around...

19:22.819 --> 19:25.344
...between the two of you.
I'm an adult...

19:25.522 --> 19:28.150
...and I'll make the decisions
about what I do in life...

19:28.324 --> 19:31.417
...thank you, including whom
I spend my time with.

19:31.593 --> 19:34.756
Now, can't you just accept the fact
that I liked all three of you...

19:34.930 --> 19:36.830
...that's why I wanted to be with you?

19:41.969 --> 19:44.563
Three?

19:47.709 --> 19:49.700
Isn't that amazing? She...

19:49.877 --> 19:52.368
She just happened to have
an extra seat to the...

19:52.547 --> 19:54.377
...Mel Torme concert.

19:55.682 --> 19:58.776
Is that something?
Or is that something?

19:59.286 --> 20:01.652
Come on, Harry. You're not
gonna back out, are you?

20:01.822 --> 20:06.554
No. It's just that when we've had some
time to put all this in perspective...

20:06.726 --> 20:09.991
Listen, I'm going.
You can do whatever you want.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.323
Bull?

20:15.501 --> 20:17.833
Dan?

20:20.705 --> 20:24.334
- I'm sorry, Suzanne.
- No, no. You own that ticket now.

20:29.214 --> 20:31.078
There. You satisfied?

20:31.248 --> 20:34.376
You could tape that sucker
back together real easy.

20:34.818 --> 20:37.810
I would have hoped that a gesture
of friendship was enough...

20:37.988 --> 20:40.354
...but evidently you guys want blood.

20:46.963 --> 20:48.225
There.

20:48.397 --> 20:50.558
Now are you happy?

20:50.733 --> 20:52.860
That was dumb.

20:53.035 --> 20:54.433
She's right, Harry.

20:54.603 --> 20:56.332
- She is?
- Suzanne, you were correct.

20:56.505 --> 21:01.135
I acted like a stereotypical
male chauvinist pig...

21:01.309 --> 21:04.142
...and I apologize.
- Yeah. Me too, Suzanne.

21:04.312 --> 21:07.109
I guess it got a little crazy around here.

21:07.281 --> 21:08.748
It won't happen again.

21:08.916 --> 21:12.545
Well, gentlemen, I appreciate
your apologies. I accept.

21:12.720 --> 21:15.188
So, what you are all saying is...

21:15.356 --> 21:17.756
- Go with her. Have fun.
- Go ahead.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.696
If you'll excuse me.

21:27.200 --> 21:31.260
Harry, I think Mel put it best
once when he said:

21:44.048 --> 21:46.539
- Hi, everything's locked up.
- Good.

21:46.717 --> 21:48.548
We're all going to Emilio's for a beer.

21:48.719 --> 21:50.812
- Wanna join us?
- Not tonight, Lana. Thanks.

21:51.989 --> 21:55.788
- It's been a crazy couple of days.
- Yeah.

21:57.460 --> 22:01.157
- Dan's coming back tomorrow.
- Great, great, great.

22:01.331 --> 22:04.061
Harry, I want you to know
I'm sorry about the concert.

22:04.234 --> 22:06.701
I know. I'm fine.
Really, thanks.

22:08.838 --> 22:11.136
Unless there's something else...

22:11.307 --> 22:14.708
No, no. Nothing.

22:16.645 --> 22:19.306
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

22:19.480 --> 22:20.947
Fine.

22:41.034 --> 22:44.730
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Mel Torme!</i>

22:44.904 --> 22:46.895
<i>One, two...</i>

22:47.874 --> 22:49.808
<i>Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

22:50.343 --> 22:53.437
<i>Now, there's good vibes tonight.</i>
