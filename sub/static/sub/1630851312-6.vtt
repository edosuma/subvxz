WEBVTT

00:05.406 --> 00:06.274
Hey. Hey, Dave.

00:06.374 --> 00:07.708
Can you grab me a wrench, man?

00:07.808 --> 00:09.410
Yeah, sure.

00:10.211 --> 00:12.012
GROVER: (growls)
(screams)

00:12.113 --> 00:14.014
(laughing)

00:14.115 --> 00:15.083
Gotcha!

00:15.183 --> 00:16.717
(laughs)
Good job, Grover.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.718
(chuckles)

00:17.818 --> 00:19.253
Okay, you know what, son?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.288
This is a teachable moment.

00:20.388 --> 00:23.091
Never prank the person
who pays your allowance.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.659
Yeah, that's why
I won't prank Mom.

00:27.161 --> 00:29.563
Man, I love Halloween.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.433
It's like Christmas,
but instead of giving out gifts,

00:32.533 --> 00:34.168
I give out nightmares.

00:35.603 --> 00:37.037
Hey, y'all.

00:37.138 --> 00:38.306
Oh, hey, Dave.

00:38.406 --> 00:40.007
Are you taking Grover
trick-or-treating?

00:40.108 --> 00:42.243
Nah, he's going to
a friend's Halloween party.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.246
Apparently, the kid's too cool
for me now.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.280
(chuckles)

00:46.380 --> 00:48.749
I saw that one coming.
(laughs)

00:48.849 --> 00:51.352
Yeah, you lasted longer
than we thought, Dave.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.321
(laughing)

00:53.421 --> 00:54.488
Oh. Uh-oh.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.590
Dad, I think there's a scratch
on your truck.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.126
What?

00:58.226 --> 00:59.360
Where?
Yeah, ri-right here.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.262
Can't you see?
It's right there.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.296
(cackles)

01:02.396 --> 01:03.397
(screams)

01:04.465 --> 01:05.766
Want to float?

01:09.337 --> 01:11.505
It's okay, guys.
It's just Malcolm.

01:12.673 --> 01:15.176
Oh, Pop,
you didn't even flinch.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.010
And this mask was not cheap.

01:17.111 --> 01:18.679
Yeah, well, your prank was.

01:18.779 --> 01:19.480
Guys.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.282
(scoffs)
I've been pranking people

01:21.382 --> 01:23.417
in this neighborhood
for over 30 years,

01:23.517 --> 01:25.586
and no one has gotten me yet.

01:25.686 --> 01:28.789
I'm the reason Freddy Krueger
moved to Elm Street.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.092
This yard is filled
with the bodies

01:32.193 --> 01:34.395
of those that
tried to scare me before.

01:34.495 --> 01:37.298
Oh, please, Pop.
I would not go that far.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.400
(screaming)

01:39.500 --> 01:41.702
(laughing)

01:41.802 --> 01:43.571
Don't leave me!

01:44.572 --> 01:48.409
Come for the king,
you best not miss! (laughs)

01:48.509 --> 01:50.378
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

01:50.478 --> 01:51.645
* Welcome to the hood.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.052
* Gonna scream on Halloween...

01:59.153 --> 02:00.521
(humming rhythmically)

02:00.621 --> 02:02.556
Oh, okay. You're
in a good mood.

02:02.656 --> 02:03.624
Let me guess,

02:03.724 --> 02:06.026
you scared the hell out of
someone this morning?

02:06.126 --> 02:07.261
(chuckles)

02:07.361 --> 02:10.398
I got Miss Kim real good.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.732
You know, it turns out

02:11.832 --> 02:13.501
she runs pretty fast
without that walker.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.369
No.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.371
Calvin, you are wrong
for that, baby.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.739
(chuckles)
That was terrible.

02:18.839 --> 02:21.742
I'm-a go over to Gemma's
and pick out a costume.

02:21.842 --> 02:24.345
I'll be back later
to give you some candy.

02:24.445 --> 02:25.979
(chuckles)
Mmm, mmm.

02:26.079 --> 02:27.548
Ooh.

02:27.648 --> 02:29.149
Did you turn the AC on?

02:29.250 --> 02:30.684
I just got the chills.

02:30.784 --> 02:32.720
No. That's all me, baby.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.323
(chuckles)
All right.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.526
(mechanical whirring)

02:38.626 --> 02:41.161
Ooh. Ooh.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.397
I do feel a little draft
in here, though.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.132
(little girl giggles)

02:46.234 --> 02:47.235
Tina?

02:47.335 --> 02:49.703
(little girl giggling)
(footsteps approaching)

02:49.803 --> 02:51.505
(door creaking)

02:52.506 --> 02:54.208
What was that?

02:58.145 --> 02:59.680
Anyone here?

02:59.780 --> 03:00.681
(door slams)

03:00.781 --> 03:03.116
(footsteps running)

03:04.785 --> 03:07.355
Oh, all right. I see.

03:08.389 --> 03:11.525
Trying to scare me
with the ole Chucky footsteps.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.361
(chuckles)

03:13.461 --> 03:15.229
Yeah, come on out.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.331
Malcolm? Marty?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.432
(curtain rustling)

03:20.568 --> 03:24.238
Oh. Well, I guess no one's here,

03:24.338 --> 03:27.375
so I'll just go
back to the kitchen.

03:33.347 --> 03:35.015
(chuckles):
Okay. Okay.

03:35.115 --> 03:37.518
I see somebody's learning
from the OG.

03:37.618 --> 03:39.086
(chuckles)
A'ight.

03:39.186 --> 03:41.154
(little girl giggles)

03:43.557 --> 03:45.726
A little girl, really?

03:45.826 --> 03:47.528
Nice try,
but I was there

03:47.628 --> 03:49.330
when your mama gave birth
to you.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.799
It's gonna take a lot more
than that to scare me.

03:55.869 --> 03:57.438
Okay, we've got
all the classics:

03:57.538 --> 04:00.073
sexy vampire,
sexy nurse,

04:00.173 --> 04:01.675
sexy maid.
Ooh.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.311
Ooh, save the sexy maid
for later.

04:03.411 --> 04:04.978
My room is dirty.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.315
Honey, we have company.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.582
It's fine.

04:08.682 --> 04:10.117
I know you two are freaks.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.622
Oh, look,
my old cheerleading uniform.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.324
Go Cobras!

04:16.424 --> 04:18.392
(chuckles)

04:18.492 --> 04:19.727
I used to roll the skirt up,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.028
so when I walked away,
you'd see my...

04:21.128 --> 04:22.396
Yeah, you're right.
I'm a freak.

04:22.496 --> 04:25.366
(chuckles):
All right. Well,
you guys have fun.

04:25.466 --> 04:27.368
I'm gonna go find a new space
for Webster here.

04:27.468 --> 04:28.969
You know, he was traumatized
this morning

04:29.069 --> 04:31.138
when I faced him
towards Miss Kim's yard.

04:34.742 --> 04:37.177
Okay. So, uh,
what do you think?

04:37.277 --> 04:39.279
Sister Mary Cleavage?
Mm.

04:39.380 --> 04:40.614
Or Satan's little helper?

04:40.714 --> 04:43.484
Ooh, I'll take the Devil.
(chuckles)

04:43.584 --> 04:46.487
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

04:46.587 --> 04:48.155
Shh...

04:49.189 --> 04:51.224
You know it's me.
Yeah, it's you.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.529
(knocking)

04:56.664 --> 04:57.998
Calvin?

04:58.098 --> 04:59.467
You home?

04:59.567 --> 05:01.602
Yeah. Hey, Dave.
What's going on?

05:01.702 --> 05:03.270
Left your wrench out front.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.038
Ah, yeah. Thank you.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.540
Ooh, while I'm here,
I was wondering,

05:06.640 --> 05:08.442
are you planning on
pranking me tonight?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.243
Because, you know,
I'm a little skittish already,

05:10.344 --> 05:11.679
and, look,
if you're gonna do it,

05:11.779 --> 05:13.447
can you just do it to me now?

05:14.482 --> 05:16.550
That's not how pranks work,
Dave.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.119
(little girl giggles)

05:19.753 --> 05:20.988
What was that?

05:21.088 --> 05:22.456
Was-was that the prank?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.992
Calvin, 'cause I told you,
I am skittish.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.728
Nah,
that's just Marty and Malcolm

05:27.828 --> 05:29.530
trying to pull a prank on me.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.065
And it's so lame,
it's a shame.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.702
(footsteps approaching)

05:35.736 --> 05:36.970
(little girl giggles)

05:37.070 --> 05:39.239
(footsteps)

05:39.339 --> 05:40.674
Okay, Calvin, uh...

05:40.774 --> 05:43.010
This all sounds pretty real
to me.

05:43.110 --> 05:44.378
No, Dave, I'll show you.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.646
They just got a fan

05:45.746 --> 05:47.681
and-and a speaker hidden in here
somewhere.

05:49.249 --> 05:53.120
LITTLE GIRL (singsongy):
You'll never find me.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.256
(singsongy):
And we don't want to.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.329
Aha!

06:02.430 --> 06:04.064
(chuckles) Found it.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.666
Man, you know what?
You would think,

06:05.766 --> 06:07.568
with me being their father,
genetically

06:07.668 --> 06:09.302
they would be better than this.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.004
Hmm.

06:11.104 --> 06:15.142
And just like that
we unplug ghost girl.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.946
So disappointing, guys.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.313
Yeah, that's right.

06:20.414 --> 06:24.117
Busted. You can't
dethrone the king.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.252
(grunts softly)

06:26.286 --> 06:28.489
LITTLE GIRL:
Do you want to play?

06:31.492 --> 06:34.462
I know I unplugged that speaker,
right, Dave?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.398
Dave?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.400
(little girl giggling)

06:44.137 --> 06:47.508
I can't believe these fools are
trying to come for the king.

06:47.608 --> 06:49.610
Now, I know my boys did it.

06:49.710 --> 06:54.682
I may not know how they did it,
but I know they did it.

06:54.782 --> 07:00.020
Or... your house is actually
haunted by a creepy little girl.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.222
(chuckles):
Be quiet, okay?

07:02.322 --> 07:04.091
We're about to get
the drop on them.

07:04.191 --> 07:07.060
And because I'm the landlord,
I got the key.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.029
Mm-hmm.

07:09.697 --> 07:12.132
(grunts)
What the hell?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.269
Okay, all right.
Well, to be fair,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.539
we didn't knock.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.240
Pop, is that you?

07:20.340 --> 07:21.975
Yeah. I wish it wasn't.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.277
MARTY:
Dad, Dad, we can talk
about boundaries later.

07:24.377 --> 07:27.080
Right now, we need your help.

07:27.180 --> 07:30.551
Why are you guys wearing
this ridiculous costume?

07:30.651 --> 07:32.185
We're going to
a costume party later,

07:32.285 --> 07:33.621
so we figured we'd
try it on first.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.388
And I told Marty
it was stupid,

07:35.489 --> 07:37.090
and the stupid zipper
got stuck.

07:37.190 --> 07:39.026
Yeah, well, then Malcolm
started freaking out,

07:39.126 --> 07:42.029
and I'm downwind from Malcolm,
so then I stated freaking out.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.196
Okay, all right, all right.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.598
Let me see what I can do.

07:44.698 --> 07:46.366
(shrieks)

07:46.466 --> 07:49.036
Very clever, fellas.
I see what you're doing.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.103
You got you a alibi.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.672
But I know that you're the ones

07:51.772 --> 07:53.641
that's behind this
creepy little girl stuff,

07:53.741 --> 07:55.509
and I'm gonna prove it.
You got to remember,

07:55.609 --> 07:56.677
I'm the prank king.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.279
What are you talking about,
Pop?

07:59.379 --> 08:02.049
We've been stuck in here
for an hour.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.350
Man, this thing
really won't budge.

08:03.450 --> 08:05.152
Ah! Hurry!

08:05.252 --> 08:07.921
I know camels can hold
their pee, but I can't!

08:08.021 --> 08:09.122
(groaning)

08:09.222 --> 08:10.423
(gasps)
(grunts)

08:10.524 --> 08:12.259
Ah! I'm not gonna make it!

08:12.359 --> 08:14.194
I'm not gonna make it!

08:16.196 --> 08:18.198
(door closes)
Huh.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.368
If you two can't get
out of a camel suit,

08:21.468 --> 08:24.404
then I know y'all not
behind the ghost girl.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.708
The question is,
who is?

08:27.808 --> 08:30.210
We already tried pranking you
this morning, Pop,

08:30.310 --> 08:31.979
and that did not work.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.715
Well, I'm gonna find out
who's behind this thing.

08:34.815 --> 08:36.416
Trust me.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.186
It can't be Tina.
No. No...

08:39.286 --> 08:40.721
Maybe it's Miss Kim.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.456
Nope. No. She's only
got one good hip.

08:44.457 --> 08:48.528
Well, I'm gonna figure out
why I agreed to go as a camel

08:48.629 --> 08:50.530
instead of Dumb and Dumber
like I wanted to.

08:50.631 --> 08:53.033
It's Halloween, son.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.168
You can't go as yourselves.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.737
(chuckling)

08:56.837 --> 09:00.007
You served it up too easy.
(forced chuckle)

09:02.009 --> 09:05.445
Ooh, girl. Look at you.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.980
You should save
that outfit

09:07.080 --> 09:09.182
for when Dave is mad at you.

09:10.483 --> 09:13.153
Oh, and I would happily spend
a night in hell with you.

09:13.253 --> 09:14.221
(growls playfully)

09:14.321 --> 09:17.057
(both grunting)

09:20.360 --> 09:22.029
Oh, hey, guys.

09:23.296 --> 09:25.032
What do you think
of our costumes?

09:25.132 --> 09:26.934
Um...

09:27.034 --> 09:30.070
I mean, uh, no offense...

09:30.170 --> 09:32.973
"No offense" is always followed
by something truly offensive,

09:33.073 --> 09:34.174
but go on.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.610
Should you be dressed that way?

09:38.278 --> 09:40.413
I mean, you-you're...
you're moms.

09:40.513 --> 09:44.017
And you have been
for, like...

09:44.117 --> 09:45.552
a while.

09:47.054 --> 09:50.190
So, what do moms dress like?

09:50.290 --> 09:55.062
Well, Uggs, messy hair,
sweatpants with holes in them.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.363
MARTY:
Yeah, uh...

09:56.463 --> 09:58.531
Chipped nail polish,
a T-shirt that says,

09:58.632 --> 10:00.567
"Everything happens
for a Riesling."

10:01.568 --> 10:03.603
Okay. It's time for
you haters to leave.
Yep. Beat it.

10:03.704 --> 10:04.772
Get out.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.976
Tina, I never thought
I'd say this,

10:09.076 --> 10:12.212
but do you think we're too old
for Sexy Halloween?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.748
You know, normally, I would
scratch your eyeballs out

10:14.848 --> 10:16.316
for saying that...
Mm-hmm.

10:16.416 --> 10:18.652
...but this corset
is killing me.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.688
Please, just give me
a pair of sweatpants.
Okay.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.356
For Halloween, I'm going
as a lady that gave up.

10:25.425 --> 10:27.460
You know, Calvin, that's
your third cup of coffee.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.496
You're damn right it is.

10:29.596 --> 10:32.032
Because I'm staying up
all night until I figure out

10:32.132 --> 10:34.201
who's trying to take
my prank crown from me.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.769
Okay. You know...

10:35.869 --> 10:37.570
Calvin, is it really
that hard to believe

10:37.671 --> 10:40.273
that a little ghost girl wants
to play with you?

10:40.373 --> 10:43.777
You know what, Dave,
you're off the case. Go home.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.447
Dave! Look!

10:50.851 --> 10:52.753
Oh, my God.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.221
Is that a tamale?

10:57.324 --> 10:59.760
No. I think it's a doll.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.061
Stop!

11:01.161 --> 11:03.363
Don't touch that.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.665
Wait, uh, Miss Kim,

11:05.766 --> 11:07.534
you-you know
who that thing belongs to?

11:07.634 --> 11:10.570
Oh, yes. And I'd hoped
I'd never have to see her again.

11:10.670 --> 11:11.739
See who?

11:11.839 --> 11:14.374
(whispers):
Emily.

11:15.475 --> 11:18.278
(whispers):
Who's... Emily?

11:19.579 --> 11:22.482
The little girl that haunts
this neighborhood.

11:22.582 --> 11:24.584
Wait a minute.
I've lived here for 30 years.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.720
I've never heard of this Emily.

11:26.820 --> 11:29.122
Have you been drinking again?

11:29.222 --> 11:31.391
Yes, but mind your business.

11:33.193 --> 11:37.297
Emily lived in this neighborhood
over a century ago.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.467
Oh, that Emily.

11:41.869 --> 11:43.503
I heard about her on NPR.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.306
The story goes that
she went missing on Halloween,

11:46.406 --> 11:49.509
and now every time there's
a harvest moon on October 31,

11:49.609 --> 11:52.645
she returns
in search of a playmate.

11:52.746 --> 11:54.447
MISS KIM:
That's right, Dave.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.683
The last time Emily was here,

11:56.784 --> 12:00.620
she picked little Willy Hopkins
to be her next playmate

12:00.720 --> 12:03.590
and almost dragged him
back to the underworld.

12:05.192 --> 12:10.063
The whole neighborhood had to
perform a ritual to free Willy.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.432
You know what, Calvin?

12:12.532 --> 12:13.500
I bet that's the little girl

12:13.600 --> 12:14.601
that's been running
around your house.

12:15.502 --> 12:16.603
She's been in your house?

12:17.604 --> 12:19.239
Ooh, that's not good.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.141
Why?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.675
Because that means
that she's chosen you

12:22.776 --> 12:24.344
to be her next playmate.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.713
So pack your bags
and include

12:26.814 --> 12:28.681
some short sleeves,
'cause where you're headed,

12:28.782 --> 12:31.018
it's gonna be hot.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.419
All right,
you know what, I'm done.

12:32.519 --> 12:34.287
I'm not listening
to this nonsense.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.423
Don't you have
a gentleman to grope?

12:37.457 --> 12:39.692
As a matter of fact, I do.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.495
So if you don't want to know
how to get rid of her,

12:42.595 --> 12:44.231
it's your funeral.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.299
I'll see you later.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.635
Or maybe I won't.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.074
That's exactly what you get

12:54.174 --> 12:56.776
when you mix bourbon
with blood pressure pills.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.646
Whoa.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.481
Where's that little ugly doll?

13:01.581 --> 13:03.416
I bet Emily took it.

13:03.516 --> 13:04.617
Calvin,
you better be careful.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.187
Look, Dave, I'm fine.
All right?

13:07.287 --> 13:10.323
This is just all
a bad Halloween prank.

13:10.423 --> 13:11.491
(door creaks)

13:11.591 --> 13:13.360
LITTLE GIRL:
Come play with me.

13:18.265 --> 13:21.334
Uh, Calvin,
that ball had blood on it.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.735
Aw, hell no.
Miss Kim!

13:22.836 --> 13:24.071
Miss Kim!

13:30.810 --> 13:33.180
Still depressed about
our insensitive children's

13:33.280 --> 13:35.348
casually cruel comments?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.184
Yeah. We gave them life,

13:37.284 --> 13:39.552
and now they're
hating on ours.
Mm-hmm.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.389
You want a mini Kit Kat?

13:42.489 --> 13:43.656
No.

13:43.756 --> 13:46.226
I want four 'cause that
makes a whole Kit Kat.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.394
(laughing)

13:47.494 --> 13:48.595
(doorbell rings)

13:48.695 --> 13:49.997
(both groan)

13:50.097 --> 13:51.564
Leave us alone!

13:51.664 --> 13:54.101
Yeah, we're trying to eat
our feelings!

13:54.201 --> 13:55.202
(groans)

13:55.302 --> 13:56.569
Trick or treat!

13:56.669 --> 13:59.339
Aw.
Aw. Gemma. What we got?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.974
Well, we are out of candy,

14:01.074 --> 14:03.376
but how about a scented candle,

14:03.476 --> 14:06.113
spare car key,
and some Clorox wipes?

14:07.447 --> 14:08.982
Say thank you, Joey.

14:09.082 --> 14:10.183
No.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.154
I am so sorry.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.588
He is in a mood tonight.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.157
Don't worry about it.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.026
By the way,
you look great, girl.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.460
Yeah.
You are one wicked witch.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.728
Mm-hmm.
Thank you!

14:21.828 --> 14:24.497
You know, earlier my son told me
my costume was embarrassing.

14:24.597 --> 14:28.068
But I wore it anyway,
'cause I am a grown-ass woman.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.971
Yas! I heard that.

14:31.071 --> 14:32.072
You know what?

14:32.172 --> 14:35.308
I have one mini Kit Kat left,
and it's all yours.

14:35.408 --> 14:36.709
Happy Halloween to me.
Yeah.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.545
(chuckling)

14:38.645 --> 14:40.047
Aw, I liked her.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.714
Yeah. You know what?

14:41.814 --> 14:43.216
She wasn't a wicked witch.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.285
She was our fairy godmother

14:45.385 --> 14:47.687
here to remind us
that we still got it.

14:47.787 --> 14:51.358
Yeah. Bibbidi-bobbidi-
forget-our-kids-boo.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.762
And forget the sweatpants, too.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.168
Whoa. You guys look amazing.
Hey. (chuckles)

15:01.268 --> 15:02.569
Mm-hmm?
Little overdressed
for a séance,

15:02.669 --> 15:05.272
but amazing.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.406
Mama!

15:06.506 --> 15:08.041
We talked about this.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.277
It's because you're a mom.

15:10.377 --> 15:14.081
We did,
and I don't care.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.718
That's right.
As moms, we decide

15:18.818 --> 15:20.420
when we're too old
for something.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.589
Now, let's get
this tea party started.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.491
MISS KIM:
All right.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.726
Gather 'round, everyone.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.328
It's time, Calvin!

15:30.263 --> 15:32.399
All right. I'm ready.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.068
Whoa, Tina.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.203
(chuckles):
Ooh!

15:36.303 --> 15:38.271
Talk about the Devil
making you do it.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.073
(chuckling)

15:40.173 --> 15:41.508
Mmm! Well, if you get

15:41.608 --> 15:43.343
that creepy little
girl out of my house,

15:43.443 --> 15:45.212
I will possess you
all night long.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.679
Focus, you two.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.218
(stammers)
Make sure you keep that on

15:51.318 --> 15:53.320
after this little
séance thing.
Okay.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.722
Are all these people
really necessary?

15:55.822 --> 15:59.526
Yes, Calvin, we all have to
be here for it to work.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.495
Now, sit.
(sighs)

16:02.595 --> 16:05.032
It's the witching hour.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.605
I have to summon her.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.075
Calvin, repeat after me.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.444
(singsongy):
Emily...

16:17.544 --> 16:22.115
it's time to play.

16:23.150 --> 16:26.553
(singsongy):
Emily...

16:26.653 --> 16:30.723
it's time to play.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.592
(electrical crackling)
(thunder rumbling)

16:32.692 --> 16:33.993
Oh.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.228
Whoa.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.729
(groaning, gasping)

16:36.829 --> 16:38.098
(footsteps running)

16:38.198 --> 16:40.367
(little girl giggling)

16:40.467 --> 16:43.103
Emily? Is that you?

16:43.203 --> 16:44.737
It's me, Dave.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.174
We met earlier.

16:47.274 --> 16:49.442
Uh, you-you have
a very nice laugh.

16:49.542 --> 16:51.144
Seriously, Dave? Come on, man.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.479
Calvin, I'm a people person,
okay?

16:52.579 --> 16:53.713
Dead or alive.

16:53.813 --> 16:55.248
(little girl giggling)

16:55.348 --> 17:00.087
Emily? It's safe
to show yourself.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.222
You don't have to hide.

17:02.322 --> 17:03.690
You're among friends.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.258
Uh, yeah.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.594
How about some double Dutch?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.362
Tina and I will
play with you.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.363
Uh-uh, girl.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.564
Don't put me in that.

17:13.400 --> 17:16.669
Invite Emily to have some tea.

17:18.471 --> 17:22.609
Emily, would you want some tea?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.977
(thunder rumbling)
(screaming)

17:27.080 --> 17:29.249
I'd love some tea, Calvin.

17:30.483 --> 17:32.685
(stammers)
H-How did you know my name?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.554
She's a ghost, Pop.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.623
She probably know
your credit score, too.

17:37.690 --> 17:40.560
Eat a cookie.
I made them myself.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.195
I-I don't see any cookies.

17:42.295 --> 17:44.197
I said eat a cookie!

17:44.297 --> 17:47.234
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Those cookies.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.402
(chuckles)

17:49.502 --> 17:51.604
(giggles)
Mmm.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.440
Delicious.

17:55.675 --> 17:57.644
(stammers) Well, you know,
look at the time.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.279
You know, it's Halloween,

17:59.379 --> 18:01.581
so I'm sure you got
a lot of other ghost,

18:01.681 --> 18:03.916
ghoulie, creepy stuff to do.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.019
So, uh, just go ahead and enjoy
the rest of your death, okay?

18:07.120 --> 18:09.556
You're coming to my world

18:09.656 --> 18:13.626
where we can play together
forever.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.664
That's gonna be a hard no
from me. Okay.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.699
(demonic voice):
Come with me!

18:20.233 --> 18:22.402
(Calvin screams)

18:22.502 --> 18:24.337
Get this little devil baby
off me!

18:24.437 --> 18:25.672
Oh, I can't... Ah!

18:25.772 --> 18:27.640
I ain't been to the Bahamas yet!

18:27.740 --> 18:29.242
(shouting indistinctly)

18:29.342 --> 18:31.178
(grunting)

18:31.278 --> 18:32.712
(all laughing)

18:32.812 --> 18:34.547
Gotcha!

18:35.582 --> 18:36.549
What?

18:36.649 --> 18:37.950
TINA:
Oh, we got him!

18:38.050 --> 18:39.051
What's going...
Yes!

18:39.152 --> 18:40.953
It was a prank, Dad.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.455
Yeah.
We finally got you.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.257
Yeah, we did.
Wait a minute.

18:44.357 --> 18:45.658
You all were in on this?

18:45.758 --> 18:47.560
(others agreeing)
Yeah. You had it coming.

18:47.660 --> 18:49.529
Remember when you put
that stink bomb in my mailbag?

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
Yeah. And then when you put
that Krazy Glue on my blunt.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.066
I was talking like this
for two days.

18:54.167 --> 18:56.336
And, baby,
it wasn't even Halloween.

18:56.436 --> 19:01.040
I mean, you can't limit all this
talent to just one day a year.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.509
But wait a minute.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.244
How did y'all do
the creepy little girl?

19:04.344 --> 19:06.446
Oh, Emily was a hologram
me and my buddies worked on

19:06.546 --> 19:07.614
at JPL.

19:07.714 --> 19:09.482
We did everything
with remote controls,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.484
projection audio,
and a fog machine.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.420
And I got all the sound effects
off the Internet.

19:13.520 --> 19:14.621
Well, except for one.

19:14.721 --> 19:16.489
(giggles)

19:16.589 --> 19:17.524
Too soon?

19:17.624 --> 19:19.025
(others laugh)

19:19.125 --> 19:21.027
Baby, we were all in on it.

19:21.127 --> 19:22.262
Don't be mad at us.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.397
I'm not mad.
(chuckles): I mean...

19:24.497 --> 19:26.098
it took a whole neighborhood

19:26.199 --> 19:29.168
and a team of engineers
just to trick me.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.137
Besides,
I wasn't even really scared.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.605
What?
(overlapping groans, chatter)

19:32.705 --> 19:34.140
Yeah, come on, Pop.

19:34.241 --> 19:35.542
You were terrified.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.644
No, I was not.
You know what I mean?

19:37.744 --> 19:40.547
The only reason that
I had tears coming out my eyes,

19:40.647 --> 19:42.382
because that doll's hair
got in there,

19:42.482 --> 19:45.051
and I'm allergic
to the synthetic...

19:45.151 --> 19:47.153
(overlapping chatter)

19:51.458 --> 19:53.326
Yesterday was so much fun.

19:53.426 --> 19:55.962
You know what, I'm glad
you all enjoyed yourselves.

19:56.062 --> 19:57.096
(chuckling)

19:57.196 --> 19:59.065
You edit the video yet, Marty?

19:59.165 --> 20:00.300
Yeah. Almost done.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.335
Just adding some close-up's
of Dad's tears.

20:02.435 --> 20:04.671
(forced laugh)

20:04.771 --> 20:06.005
You know what?

20:06.105 --> 20:08.007
I got everybody
a little something

20:08.107 --> 20:10.477
to congratulate you
on finally pranking me.

20:10.577 --> 20:13.413
So, uh, here.
Go ahead and open it.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.348
Ooh, I love mixed nuts.
(others disagreeing)

20:15.448 --> 20:16.749
What?

20:16.849 --> 20:18.251
Do not open that.

20:18.351 --> 20:19.486
It's the oldest trick
in the book, man.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.155
(chuckles):
You got me.

20:23.256 --> 20:26.158
(chuckling)

20:26.259 --> 20:28.194
Eh, I guess I'm losing my touch.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.729
(chuckles)
It's okay. It's all right.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.398
Hey, Malcolm, uh,
turn the game on.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.633
Oh, that's right.
(grunts): Yep.

20:34.367 --> 20:36.636
What y'all doing?
(screaming)

20:38.137 --> 20:39.706
(laughing)

20:42.709 --> 20:45.278
(chuckles) Yes!

20:45.378 --> 20:47.013
I'm still the king!

20:47.113 --> 20:49.682
(both chuckling)

20:49.782 --> 20:51.651
So, you're gonna fix
my transmission, right?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.252
Uh, nah.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.722
That was also
a part of the prank. (laughs)
