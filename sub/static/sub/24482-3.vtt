WEBVTT

01:20.371 --> 01:22.040
You didn't have to, you know...

01:23.500 --> 01:27.504
-I know. I just thought--
-Since you were leaving.

01:28.546 --> 01:32.425
Is it wrong to want to say goodbye
to my sister?

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
You know I'd bring you if I could.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.766
Let's not ruin things
with a bunch of lies, Jess.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.143
-I'm just trying--

01:43.394 --> 01:47.315
Why would I apologize
for being a productive member of society?

01:47.398 --> 01:48.566
Oh, there's the girl I know.

01:48.650 --> 01:52.153
At some point, you have to
take responsibility for your choices.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.115
Coming from someone
who's never had to make any.

01:55.698 --> 01:57.450
That's not fair.
-Ah.

01:57.575 --> 01:59.744
Your college wasn't paid for?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.539
Dad didn't leave you the business?

02:02.622 --> 02:04.666
What

02:05.125 --> 02:06.918
You're a criminal, June.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.629
I've made mistakes.

02:09.712 --> 02:12.048
And I'm glad you recognize that.

02:13.383 --> 02:18.138
But they don't want mistakes
in the new world.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.306
Well, thanks for the meal.
Have a nice flight.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.558
Oh. Wait.

02:23.017 --> 02:28.314
I didn't ask you here to fight. I just...
I just wanted to give you these.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.819
My house. My car.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.738
I'm not gonna need them anymore, so...

02:36.156 --> 02:37.657
I don't deserve this.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.827
No, no. Start fresh.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.622
Be a better version of yourself.

02:50.211 --> 02:51.045
Yes.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.463
I could drive your car?

02:55.216 --> 02:57.719
-If you'd like.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.267
So I could just... I could just be you?

04:57.213 --> 04:58.047
Yeah.

04:59.424 --> 05:02.593
I was looking at it...
I was looking for anything to orient us.

05:02.969 --> 05:06.347
Anything familiar,
a planet or a constellation.

05:07.140 --> 05:10.935
But there was nothing, nothing--
There was nothing I recognized at all.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.812
Okay. I don't understand.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.148
Exactly how lost are we talking about?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.567
Yeah, "Can't find your car
in the parking lot" lost?

05:17.650 --> 05:23.114
Well, if this is Earth
and this is Alpha Centauri,

05:23.948 --> 05:29.037
we are, metaphorically, maybe,
a 600-year drive away.

05:29.746 --> 05:30.580
Maybe.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.000
Okay, so, not metaphorically...

05:34.292 --> 05:36.836
Trillions of light years. It's, uh...

05:38.963 --> 05:41.049
Look, if we got here, we can get back.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.678
So... how do we get back? Honestly, unless the <i>Resolute </i>is intact
and can find us,

05:53.019 --> 05:54.228
we might be stuck here.

05:57.607 --> 06:01.069
Which is why I need everyone
working on the problem.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.278
Maureen.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.905
We need to get comms operational.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.990
Can't do that until we get the ship
out of the ice.

06:06.074 --> 06:07.533
-Judy, you need to get--
-Maureen.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.576
What?

06:09.285 --> 06:11.454
-I think we should take a breather.
What?

06:11.537 --> 06:13.956
With the storm outside,
there's nothing we can do,

06:14.040 --> 06:18.086
and I think we'd all think a lot clearer
after some rest.

06:21.255 --> 06:24.550
-I am kind of tired.
-Yeah. I think we all are.

06:28.846 --> 06:31.891
Just an hour, Mom. Then I'll be ready.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.726
Okay.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.981
Okay. I will wake everybody up
after the storm.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.108
Thanks, Mom.

07:00.586 --> 07:03.548
-Oh, no, Doctor, don't. I've got it.
-Oh, please. Let me.

07:04.549 --> 07:05.800
Thank you.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.471
Um, your family...

07:11.556 --> 07:15.810
Unfortunately, I...
I had to leave them behind.

07:17.895 --> 07:18.771
Oh.

07:19.313 --> 07:20.606
No, it's okay.

07:21.441 --> 07:25.027
No husband, no kids.
Makes it a little easier.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.364
You're welcome to stay with us until...

07:32.952 --> 07:35.663
Let me show you
where you can store your stuff.

07:38.082 --> 07:40.751
Doctor, engineer, soldier.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.422
Sounds like I was rescued
by the right family.

07:45.089 --> 07:46.924
I wouldn't say we're...

07:48.217 --> 07:50.428
-It's complicated.
-Most families are.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.849
-I'm a psychologist.
-Oh.

07:54.974 --> 07:57.560
I actually specialize in family therapy.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.812
You've come to the right place.

07:59.896 --> 08:03.858
Seriously, if there's anything I could do
to repay you somehow...

08:03.941 --> 08:06.027
Don't worry, we'll put you to work.

08:06.694 --> 08:09.405
Um, so, you can store your stuff in there.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.659
I'm sorry we don't have extra bunks,
but there's, uh, blankets.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.869
Please. I'll manage.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.079
Okay. See you in a bit.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.831
See you. Good night.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.670
It's fine.
It's just the ice shifting.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.133
I thought you needed the rest.

09:11.217 --> 09:13.636
I needed to relax.
There's a difference.

09:22.019 --> 09:23.604
Hey, hon. Look...

09:24.355 --> 09:27.775
what you went through out there
in the ice...

09:28.359 --> 09:30.361
I know what that kind of fear
can do to your body.

09:30.444 --> 09:33.406
More importantly,
what it can do to your mind.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.866
-So, if there's anything you need to--

09:35.950 --> 09:36.909
I'm fine, Dad.

09:43.874 --> 09:44.750
Okay.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.670
You do what you have to do.

12:27.872 --> 12:28.998
You okay?

12:29.540 --> 12:31.750
Yeah.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.336
Bad dream?

12:37.047 --> 12:38.048
Sort of.

12:39.633 --> 12:44.388
Don't tell anyone, but I still get them
from time to time.

12:45.723 --> 12:50.895
And when I do,
it helps to say what they were out loud.

12:57.693 --> 13:01.113
It was nothing. Really. I'm fine.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.378
I thought you said
it wasn't dangerous.

13:22.760 --> 13:23.886
I'm gonna go back to bed.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.222
Sorry.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.311
Please don't mention anything to my dad.

13:32.394 --> 13:33.687
-Oh.
-About my nightmare.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.440
I'm good at keeping secrets.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.579
Will?
-In here, Mom!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.332
Uh...

13:53.749 --> 13:54.708
What happened?

13:54.792 --> 13:57.753
I don't know.
It was like something just hit us.

13:57.836 --> 13:59.880
It's the glacier. It's breaking apart.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.924
-When the girls used the blast jets--
-Wasn't me.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.218
Yeah. It wasn't her who totally saved
everybody's life.

14:05.219 --> 14:09.306
If we don't get the Jupiter out of here,
the whole thing's gonna collapse on us.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.978
The storm's over. It's all clear up there.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.231
Okay. Judy, pre-flight checklist.
Start with the thrusters.

14:17.314 --> 14:20.067
Penny, as we get closer to the surface,
I want you on the radio.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.653
Soon as we get the signal, we broadcast.
See if the <i>Resolute</i>--

14:22.736 --> 14:24.071
Maureen.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.865
We got a problem with the engines.

14:26.657 --> 14:27.575
What kind of problem?

14:28.325 --> 14:29.577
We don't have any.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.295
-It's heavy particulate from the storm.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.383
It's blocking the air flow
to the ventilation shafts.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.016
We're not going anywhere
until we clear this out.

14:54.768 --> 14:58.606
-I'll get Judy to come down and start--

14:58.689 --> 14:59.899
What do you mean, ready?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.401
After what happened,
you're not worried about her?

15:02.484 --> 15:04.820
I'm worried about a lot of things,
Judy's not one of them.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.363
She'll pull through. She always does.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.909
Well, maybe she'll pull through faster
if we let her sit this out.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.785
You know, give her time--

15:11.869 --> 15:14.914
We don't have time, John.
This part of the glacier is--

15:14.997 --> 15:17.082
Unstable. Yeah, I know.

15:18.042 --> 15:18.959
So is our daughter.

15:19.627 --> 15:23.213
You really think you're the best judge
of what she can and can't handle?

15:25.466 --> 15:29.803
Look, I know you and the kids
are this team, but...

15:31.472 --> 15:35.601
...if I'm gonna be here,
you gotta let me be here.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.609
All right. Um...

15:44.652 --> 15:47.988
Then how do you think
we should handle our new guest?

15:48.072 --> 15:53.661
Well, it seems to want to help us,
but we don't know why it's here, or what--

15:53.744 --> 15:55.371
I meant Dr. Smith.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.540
Oh. Yeah, right. Um...

16:00.167 --> 16:02.294
Well, if she qualified for Alpha Centauri,

16:02.378 --> 16:05.673
she must be trained
in emergency procedures,

16:05.756 --> 16:07.216
so she should be fine.

16:10.344 --> 16:13.055
Okay, aft engine cage.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.641
We need to disassemble
the contaminated thrusters.

16:15.724 --> 16:18.811
So bag and heat-seal anything
that needs to be on VC levels.

16:19.687 --> 16:21.605
-Yeah. Sure.

16:22.606 --> 16:25.943
How about you and I work together?
Okay, everybody else pair up.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.778
-Dibs on Will.

16:27.861 --> 16:31.031
I want to spend quality time
with my brother. What's wrong with that?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.449
You guys are on detox.

16:32.533 --> 16:36.120
Every piece needs to be wiped completely
clear before it goes into the cage.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.579
Guess you're with me.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.165
Hey, you two,
flush out the combustion chamber

16:40.249 --> 16:42.626
so we don't re-circ any contaminants
into the system.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.923
Uh, John, does that sound okay?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.884
Sure. Let's get this done.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.473
Um... Okay.

16:57.057 --> 16:59.518
Your robot's totally gonna
do the work for us, right?

17:03.981 --> 17:07.151
You go ahead.
I'm gonna print a few replacement parts.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.485
Okay.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.743
Is it safe?

17:59.328 --> 18:02.247
I think that's the first time
I've ever heard you ask that.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.960
Well, you haven't been around
to hear much of anything, so...

18:12.049 --> 18:13.675
Hey, Jude?

18:15.427 --> 18:17.221
It's okay if you don't want
to come down here.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.391
Mom always says four hands
are better than two.

18:21.475 --> 18:24.853
Doesn't she also say
"too many cooks spoil the broth"?

18:26.438 --> 18:28.023
Not one time.

18:31.026 --> 18:32.236
John?

18:32.611 --> 18:33.987
Speaking of which...

18:55.968 --> 18:58.137
Hey. Everything okay?

18:58.220 --> 18:59.721
Did you use the printer today?

19:00.139 --> 19:01.557
No. Why?

19:02.266 --> 19:05.102
A record came up.
Someone ran a program outside protocol.

19:05.185 --> 19:07.855
Oh. So you automatically assume it was me?

19:08.272 --> 19:10.524
Not assuming. I'm asking.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.738
Okay, I did think about it,
but it wouldn't let me.

19:17.197 --> 19:18.490
Jesus, John.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.869
This isn't your commune on Alpha Centauri.
We need protection.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.121
You know how I feel about weapons
in our house.

19:24.204 --> 19:25.956
We already have one, Maureen.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.792
It belongs to an 11-year-old boy
and we have no idea how to use it.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.211
-It's protecting Will.

19:31.295 --> 19:33.755
After everything that's happened,
I'm relieved.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.757
It's one less thing
we have to worry about.

19:37.676 --> 19:40.220
More importantly,
if you didn't print something, who did?

19:45.726 --> 19:47.102
We can skip the heat exchanger,

19:47.186 --> 19:49.771
but let's pull the rotary coupling
and the igniter.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.607
Okay.

19:55.527 --> 19:57.654
I have to be honest with you
about something.

19:57.738 --> 20:00.699
And if it makes you regret taking me in,
I wouldn't blame you.

20:02.576 --> 20:04.578
I was actually gonna ask you.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.955
How did you get past the restrictions?

20:08.290 --> 20:09.333
What do you mean?

20:10.459 --> 20:13.253
On the printer.
There's a firewall so people can't--

20:13.337 --> 20:16.298
I think our signals are crossed.
I haven't touched your printer.

20:18.508 --> 20:19.384
Oh.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.428
Sorry.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.724
-It's just that, uh...

20:25.807 --> 20:31.104
my grasp of emergency training
isn't what it should be. Uh...

20:31.980 --> 20:35.108
Most of my prep-grouping
was occupational and not familial,

20:35.192 --> 20:37.736
and most of them
were more mechanically inclined,

20:37.819 --> 20:39.196
so I figured they would...

20:41.865 --> 20:43.867
I'm sorry. I...

20:44.576 --> 20:46.536
I really should've paid more attention.

20:48.121 --> 20:51.375
I just never imagined we'd end up--

20:51.458 --> 20:53.961
Hey, it's okay. Nobody did.

20:56.922 --> 21:00.509
Really? You seem like you've been
preparing for this since you were a child.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.511
Might explain why
I didn't have a lot of friends.

21:02.594 --> 21:05.180
Oh, stop it.
-No, seriously.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.598
Look at you.

21:07.182 --> 21:11.228
Successful, intelligent, beautiful.

21:13.605 --> 21:15.774
You remind me of my sister.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.947
I didn't have any siblings.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.657
It would've been nice.

21:23.740 --> 21:26.410
Someone to help with the chores,
work the fields.

21:26.493 --> 21:30.622
Work the fields?
Am I standing next to a genuine farm girl?

21:31.623 --> 21:33.417
-In the flesh.
-Oh.

21:34.126 --> 21:37.963
Not a lot of farm girls
grow up to be aerospace engineers.

21:38.046 --> 21:41.091
-Well, when you wish upon a star...

21:41.174 --> 21:44.094
<i>♪ Makes no difference who you are ♪</i>

21:48.473 --> 21:49.975
What the hell is that?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.481
What's going on?
Fuel level's dropping,

21:56.565 --> 21:58.984
which is weird 'cause we're not using any.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.697
Damage from the ice
could've caused a leak.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.324
I'll go check it out.

22:05.407 --> 22:07.951
Keep an eye on the fuel.
If it drops any faster, radio me, okay?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.244
Okay.

22:11.913 --> 22:12.831
Me, too.

22:35.812 --> 22:37.606
Your mom said
you'd know what to do with this?

23:22.484 --> 23:25.195
Uh, yeah, that's fine.
Just leave it there. Thank you.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.619
What do you think about her?

23:33.328 --> 23:36.039
Dr. Smith? I don't know.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.919
-I don't know. I like her hair.

23:41.002 --> 23:42.879
What about judging a book by its cover?

23:42.963 --> 23:44.923
Whoever said that
has never been to a bookstore.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.676
You've never been to a bookstore.
The last one closed in--

23:47.759 --> 23:48.760
That's not my point.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.144
Hey, come back.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.105
These parts aren't gonna clean themselves.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.900
Yeah, thank you. Cool robot, Will.

24:20.250 --> 24:23.712
Well, if there is a fuel leak,
it's not wide scale.

24:24.796 --> 24:26.631
I'm gonna take a closer look.

24:49.738 --> 24:52.532
Thanks. So, new development.

24:53.116 --> 24:56.119
Somewhere along the line,
we started bleeding fuel.

24:56.494 --> 24:58.747
What do we do?

25:00.040 --> 25:02.918
Same thing we've been doing,
only a lot faster.

25:03.293 --> 25:05.503
How much longer do you think we have?

25:05.587 --> 25:08.632
Until we run out of fuel
or until the glacier crushes us?

25:08.715 --> 25:11.301
Seriously, why don't we all
pile into that Chariot

25:11.384 --> 25:13.720
and get the hell out of here
before it's too late?

25:13.803 --> 25:15.013
Not a chance.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.766
Maybe one or two people
could survive in there for a bit,

25:17.849 --> 25:20.352
but not all of us.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.232
I'm gonna take these to the kids
and see how they're doing on those parts.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.524
Okay, great.

25:49.339 --> 25:52.842
Hey! What are you looking for?

25:54.177 --> 25:55.303
Come on.

25:56.012 --> 25:57.847
I thought you were supposed to
listen to me.

26:19.202 --> 26:20.245
No!

26:22.080 --> 26:22.956
Mom!

26:26.918 --> 26:28.128
Will?

26:29.879 --> 26:30.714
Will!

26:32.173 --> 26:33.508
-I don't know.

26:33.591 --> 26:35.510
Danger, Will Robinson.

26:35.593 --> 26:37.095
What kind of danger?

26:37.721 --> 26:40.265
-Mom, be careful!
What happened?

26:40.348 --> 26:41.850
There's something on the ship.

26:45.145 --> 26:47.063
Okay. We definitely got a leak.

26:47.564 --> 26:50.734
-I'm just, uh, trying to find the...

26:51.943 --> 26:53.862
-...source.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.406
Dad?

27:03.204 --> 27:04.039
Dad?

27:04.748 --> 27:05.790
John?

27:09.502 --> 27:10.337
John?

27:11.963 --> 27:13.340
Joh

27:13.423 --> 27:16.259
I... I think he's still in the basement.
Why

27:16.343 --> 27:18.345
Will said there's something on board.
Some kind of--

27:18.428 --> 27:19.429
Some kind of what?

27:19.512 --> 27:22.349
Judy, you go find Dr. Smith.
Penny, you stay here and--

27:28.271 --> 27:29.814
Don't go downstairs.

27:33.526 --> 27:35.528
-It is now.
Okay.

27:39.991 --> 27:43.662
No idea, but it probably came in through
one of the puncture holes from the crash.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.955
-Yeah.

27:46.039 --> 27:48.541
Smells like it's been hiding
in someone's butthole.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.297
I've never seen anything like it.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.891
Wait, where's Will?

28:04.974 --> 28:07.852
It's okay. He's safe.
The robot locked him in the closet.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.270
Okay.

28:13.942 --> 28:15.944
I think that smell is fuel.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.738
Makes sense.
I found it in the water next to the tank.

28:19.739 --> 28:21.991
<i> Warning.</i>
<i>Fuel level at 52%.</i>

28:22.075 --> 28:23.785
Fuel's dropping. Faster now.

28:37.257 --> 28:40.677
And I'm never having unagi again.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.933
Our fuel isn't leaking. It's being eaten.

28:47.976 --> 28:49.936
Our fuel is a methane hybrid.

28:50.895 --> 28:54.482
One of the compounds must be similar
to its food source on the planet.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.943
Any ideas how we get out of this one?

28:58.403 --> 28:59.988
I need a bigger whiteboard.

29:01.030 --> 29:02.532
Are those our fuel tanks?

29:02.615 --> 29:04.701
Is anyone else
never sleeping in here again?

29:05.785 --> 29:06.828
Is it just me?

29:06.911 --> 29:08.830
The Jupiters were built
with two fuel tanks:

29:08.913 --> 29:13.001
the primary and the reserve.
So far, our reserves are untouched.

29:13.501 --> 29:16.171
If it stays that way,
we'll have enough to get out of the ice.

29:16.254 --> 29:19.048
So we need to trap those things
and keep 'em out of the other tank.

29:19.132 --> 29:22.635
Yes, but the emergency settings
will open the reserve tank

29:22.719 --> 29:25.180
when the primary gets too low,
and the only way to stop that

29:25.263 --> 29:27.807
is to turn it off manually at the source.

29:29.768 --> 29:33.021
So, um, we have to go down
where the eels are?

29:33.104 --> 29:37.317
At the rate these things are going,
we have about 15 minutes before we're dry.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.152
I'll handle the tank.

29:40.445 --> 29:42.113
You just get us ready to fly.

29:50.121 --> 29:51.456
Hey, Dad?

29:52.665 --> 29:53.958
-I can help.

29:54.751 --> 29:56.878
Oh, it's okay. You sit this one out.

29:56.961 --> 29:59.964
No, seriously, I'm... I can handle it.

30:00.048 --> 30:02.342
I believe you, I do.

30:04.969 --> 30:06.429
I want you to believe it, too.

30:22.237 --> 30:23.530
I need to get in there.

30:24.447 --> 30:26.074
Danger, Will Robinson.

30:26.157 --> 30:29.369
I know it's dangerous.
It's gonna get a lot more dangerous

30:29.452 --> 30:31.412
if I can't get in there
to get a torque wrench.

30:37.293 --> 30:41.256
Will, can you tell your robot
to open the damn door?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.174
I've been trying. He won't listen.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.265
Judy.

30:50.974 --> 30:51.808
Yeah?

30:51.891 --> 30:55.687
Judy, I need you to print me
a torque wrench, 11/16".

30:56.271 --> 30:58.064
That's gonna take--
-I know.

30:59.691 --> 31:04.404
-Mom said we've only got--

31:10.451 --> 31:12.245
I'm gonna buy us some more time.

31:16.457 --> 31:17.625
I just...

31:20.003 --> 31:21.546
I don't understand.

31:21.629 --> 31:24.507
It's okay. It's not your fault.

31:24.924 --> 31:27.051
He usually does what I want him to do.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.390
Really?

31:33.975 --> 31:35.518
Why do you think that is?

31:35.602 --> 31:39.606
I don't know.
Maybe it's his way of saying thank you.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.108
For what?

31:43.693 --> 31:44.736
For saving his life.

31:48.531 --> 31:50.533
And now it's like we're connected.

31:51.242 --> 31:54.537
Like he just knows what I want him to do.

31:55.997 --> 31:57.290
Until now.

32:10.053 --> 32:13.681
Maybe he's not listening to your voice...

32:15.767 --> 32:19.854
because he's listening to what's inside.

32:21.189 --> 32:22.440
What do you mean?

32:25.276 --> 32:31.741
Every day, we have these little battles
going on inside of us,

32:33.868 --> 32:36.329
between what we want to do...

32:38.081 --> 32:40.541
and what we need to do. And...

32:43.711 --> 32:46.172
sometimes they can be
very different things.

33:00.561 --> 33:03.272
<i>Level three access confirmed.</i>

33:04.232 --> 33:08.444
<i>Level three access confirmed.</i>
<i>Level three access confirmed.</i>

33:08.528 --> 33:09.529
Morning.

33:10.780 --> 33:11.864
Good morning.

33:13.866 --> 33:16.411

33:27.588 --> 33:28.798
Excuse me, miss?

33:28.881 --> 33:31.342
<i>Level three access confirmed.</i>

33:32.385 --> 33:35.096
Hey, Jessica Harris,
I've been looking for you.

33:37.223 --> 33:39.809
Hey, come on, why aren't you stopping?

33:40.977 --> 33:42.395
I'm sorry, I...

33:42.478 --> 33:44.105
No, I'm sorry.

33:44.188 --> 33:46.524
I just haven't been able
to get away from Holly lately.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.110
At this point,
I don't even care if she finds out.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.487
I just need to be with you.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.123
Jesus, Jess.
I thought you'd been avoiding me.

34:02.206 --> 34:04.876
-I don't want anyone to see us.

34:06.627 --> 34:07.795
Wait a minute.

34:10.757 --> 34:12.842
-Let's make a deal.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.095
You don't tell anyone about me,

34:16.179 --> 34:18.931
and I won't tell your wife
about your bad taste in women.

34:22.560 --> 34:24.145
<i>Access granted.</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.315
<i>-Stand clear.</i>

34:29.734 --> 34:32.487
<i>-Air lock releasing in ten seconds.</i>
You don't wanna do this.

34:32.570 --> 34:33.988
<i>Press to override.</i>

34:34.072 --> 34:35.698
<i>-Nine, eight...</i>
-Press the button.

34:35.782 --> 34:37.909
-You don't want to do this to me.
<i>-...seven, six, </i>

34:37.992 --> 34:40.870
<i>-five, four, three...</i>
-Just press the override button.

34:40.953 --> 34:42.872
-...<i>two, one.</i>
-Please, override it!

35:10.608 --> 35:12.026
Salt for the eels.

35:12.610 --> 35:15.655
Clever. Sixth grade biology?

35:15.738 --> 35:17.573
Close. Fifth grade.

35:17.657 --> 35:19.408
It was actually Jimmy Sewerth's backyard.

35:19.492 --> 35:23.621
You told me I couldn't play with him
because anyone who tortures worms

35:23.704 --> 35:25.498
is destined to be a future serial killer.

35:25.581 --> 35:28.417
Right. Well, Jimmy's not going
to Alpha Centauri, is he?

35:31.921 --> 35:36.342
Your dad thinks I expect too much
of you kids sometimes. Do you?

35:38.136 --> 35:40.304
Um... no.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.266
I don't think you expect too much from us.

35:43.349 --> 35:47.395
I just think maybe, sometimes,
you expect too little from Dad.

35:49.063 --> 35:52.066
Hey, Judy. How's it going?

35:52.733 --> 35:54.819
Every time you ask, it goes faster.

35:54.902 --> 35:56.529
<i>Okay, so not yet. </i>

35:58.406 --> 35:59.323
Are you okay?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.784
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

36:15.006 --> 36:16.007
Hey, Maureen.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.800
<i>How are the engines coming along?</i>

36:20.261 --> 36:22.180
-One down, one to go.
<i>-Great.</i>

36:22.263 --> 36:25.183
Oh!

36:25.558 --> 36:27.768
I think some of these pieces
are still back in the hub.

36:27.852 --> 36:30.646
-Yeah. But be careful.

36:31.230 --> 36:32.315
Mmm-hmm.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.444
What... What are you doing?

36:37.153 --> 36:38.571
I'm being careful.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.761
What are you looking at?

37:24.867 --> 37:26.744
<i>Surface unstable.</i>

37:27.286 --> 37:28.287
Hey.

37:30.498 --> 37:33.376
Sure. Judy, you okay?

37:36.712 --> 37:37.588
Yeah.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.217
But the torque wrench, it didn't print.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.635
<i>Auxiliary tank released.</i>

37:42.718 --> 37:44.011
Don't worry. It's okay.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.722
-John...
-Judy, hold a sec.

37:47.473 --> 37:50.601
When the Jupiter's weight shifted,
it must've exposed the fuel sensor

37:50.685 --> 37:53.187
and released the reserves
into the main tank.

37:53.396 --> 37:57.066
That's all the fuel we have left.
Now they got it.

37:57.733 --> 37:59.610
We can't wait. We gotta launch right now.

37:59.694 --> 38:02.113
The last thruster's almost done.
I just have to secure it.

38:02.196 --> 38:03.739
-So...
-Five minutes, tops.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.283
Dad!

38:05.950 --> 38:06.784
Penny?

38:06.867 --> 38:07.910
Dad, help!

38:07.994 --> 38:09.245
Penny!
-Something's wrong.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.080
Whatever it is,
I'm sure your family will--

38:11.163 --> 38:12.665
-They need me!
Where are you?

38:12.748 --> 38:15.042
Do something! Please!
Penny!

38:15.418 --> 38:17.003
Why won't you listen to me?

38:18.087 --> 38:21.048
Please, help them.

38:21.132 --> 38:22.758
Penny, where are you?

38:23.634 --> 38:26.595
I don't understand.
Why won't he listen to me?

38:26.679 --> 38:28.180
Shh. Deep breaths.

38:28.764 --> 38:30.433
Fear is a powerful emotion, Will.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.312
If you and that machine
are as connected as you say,

38:34.395 --> 38:35.688
he can sense that fear in you.

38:37.648 --> 38:38.649
It's okay to be afraid.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.402
To want to save yourself.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.656
No, it's not.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.160
Self-preservation is nothing
to be ashamed of.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.829
It's how we learn to survive.

39:00.129 --> 39:01.130
Help.

39:02.298 --> 39:04.633
Mom.

39:06.344 --> 39:07.428
Dad!

39:08.304 --> 39:09.221
Dad.

39:12.266 --> 39:13.768
Hey, sweetie. You okay?

39:13.851 --> 39:14.685
Been better.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.979
Yeah, that's going around.

39:17.063 --> 39:19.440
They're all around me. I can't move.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.442
Oh, my God!

39:21.525 --> 39:23.694
-Hey! Hey!
-No!

39:23.778 --> 39:24.695
It's on my leg!

39:24.779 --> 39:29.784
No! It hurts, Dad.
-Sweetie, it's okay.

39:29.867 --> 39:32.870
They're not after you,
they're after the fuel.

39:32.953 --> 39:35.081
But the fuel is... It's all over me!

39:36.415 --> 39:39.126
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.628
How do you know?

39:41.337 --> 39:42.963
Daddy?

39:44.507 --> 39:47.385
Daddy, no!
-Go! Go!

39:48.969 --> 39:52.681
Go to the hub. Come on! Come on!

39:55.726 --> 39:58.896
Are we gonna die in here?
-No.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.274
-'Course I'm sure.

40:03.192 --> 40:06.612
You and me, we're survivors, aren't we?

40:06.695 --> 40:10.741
<i> Warning.</i>
<i>Fuel level at 45%. No reserves.</i>

40:11.367 --> 40:13.327
Here's what I think.

40:14.620 --> 40:18.457
Your family, they risked their lives
out there in the storm to save me.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.002
So I think it's time I risked my life
to save them.

40:22.086 --> 40:25.798
I don't understand. We're in here.
How are you gonna get out there?

40:25.881 --> 40:30.094
Your robot! Think about it.
He only cares about putting you in danger.

40:30.177 --> 40:31.971
He could care less what happens to me.

40:32.054 --> 40:33.764
But I care what happens to you.

40:43.941 --> 40:46.694
I appreciate that, Will. I really do.

40:47.653 --> 40:51.323
But one thing you'll learn about me...
I can handle myself.

40:54.493 --> 40:57.496
Come on, tell him.

40:59.290 --> 41:01.542
Robot, I'm gonna need you to listen.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.238
Okay.

41:58.766 --> 42:01.185
Okay! Okay!

42:02.353 --> 42:05.231
-My mom and dad, make sure they're--
I will.

42:05.314 --> 42:06.565
And my sisters--
-Don't worry.

42:08.025 --> 42:09.193
I got this.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.165
<i> Warning.</i>

Oh, no.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.054
Come on!

43:23.684 --> 43:25.144
Oh! Come on!

43:30.482 --> 43:33.152
Oh, thank God!

43:33.611 --> 43:34.945
Oh, thank you. Okay, okay.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.618
We're good. Let's go.

43:41.493 --> 43:42.661
You look terrible.

43:42.745 --> 43:44.038
Thanks. You, too.

43:45.372 --> 43:46.206
Okay.

43:47.541 --> 43:50.836
-Figuring out how to save your ass.

43:50.919 --> 43:53.339
And she's back.

43:53.422 --> 43:56.258
<i>Warning. Fuel level at 15%.</i>

43:56.342 --> 43:58.552
That's okay.
15% should be enough to get us out.

43:58.636 --> 44:02.348
-They should just burn up on ignition.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.600
Everyone hold tight.

44:12.066 --> 44:14.234
You've gotta be kidding me.

44:14.318 --> 44:17.571
-Nothing. We should be--
<i>Warning. Fuel at 10%.</i>

44:17.655 --> 44:19.281
<i>-No reserves.</i>
-Everything checks out.

44:20.074 --> 44:22.785
We're gonna get crushed.
What do we do?

44:25.329 --> 44:27.122
-Dump the fuel.

44:27.206 --> 44:29.667
-Dump the fuel.
-We can't, we need--

44:29.750 --> 44:33.879
If those things are still in the tank,
they might be clogging the intake valve,

44:33.962 --> 44:36.048
which means
whatever fuel is left down there

44:36.131 --> 44:37.758
can't get into the combustion chamber.

44:37.841 --> 44:40.219
Ever drink fresh lemonade
and get a seed stuck in your straw?

44:40.302 --> 44:41.970
I know, Judy, it's just--

44:42.054 --> 44:45.432
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Fuel level at 8%. No reserves.</i>

44:45.516 --> 44:46.392
Trust me.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.229
There's still enough fuel in the lines
to get us out.

44:51.814 --> 44:52.898
Do it.

44:55.567 --> 44:59.613
<i>Fuel ejection system... activated.</i>

45:04.201 --> 45:06.662
Maureen, does this thing run on fumes?

45:07.746 --> 45:09.123
I sure as hell hope so.

45:44.408 --> 45:45.242
Dad?

45:45.534 --> 45:47.119
Dad, watch out!

46:26.033 --> 46:28.535
-John...
-It's okay, I got this.

46:35.042 --> 46:36.335
John?

46:36.418 --> 46:38.253
Dad?
-Brace yourselves.

46:47.387 --> 46:48.514
You okay?

46:53.560 --> 46:56.939
Does anybody have a mop?
I may have barfed a little.

47:02.361 --> 47:03.654
It's beautiful.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.537
Nice bit of flying you did.

47:12.746 --> 47:14.039
It's a good crew.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.295
We've got comms. They're live!

47:20.379 --> 47:23.465
<i>This is Mark on </i>Jupiter 22...
There are other survivors.

47:23.549 --> 47:26.218

We're not alone.

47:26.301 --> 47:28.136
<i>Standby.</i>

47:28.637 --> 47:34.476
-Wait a sec. Will. Will. Will!

47:48.699 --> 47:49.825
Will?

47:53.620 --> 47:54.621
Mom!

48:02.212 --> 48:04.381
I'm so sorry I wasn't there to help.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.550
It's okay, sweetie.

48:07.134 --> 48:08.969
You would've if you could've.

48:36.330 --> 48:39.499
Guys! Guys, come here! Quick!

49:02.814 --> 49:05.067
<i>-toward our new home on Alpha Centauri.</i>

49:05.150 --> 49:07.361
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you!

49:09.363 --> 49:12.366
Mom, Mom, Mom!

49:13.909 --> 49:15.369
I know, baby.

49:17.579 --> 49:20.207
<i>And for those of you</i>
<i>who are unable to return,</i>

49:20.290 --> 49:23.001
<i>know that as soon as repairs</i>
<i>are completed,</i>

49:23.543 --> 49:25.170
<i>we will find you.</i>

49:29.257 --> 49:32.803
Did you really think we wouldn't find you?
Do you think you're the first person

49:32.886 --> 49:35.931
who thought they could fake their way
into a new life?

49:36.807 --> 49:39.434
June Harris. Quite a career.

49:39.810 --> 49:43.230
Breaking and entering.
Possession of stolen goods.

49:43.313 --> 49:44.481
Identity theft.

49:44.564 --> 49:48.151
Now it seems you've graduated
to the big time.

49:48.235 --> 49:53.490
We have you on camera
taking that man's life.

49:53.573 --> 49:57.494
I was defending myself.
It wasn't my fault.

49:57.577 --> 49:59.579
You don't actually believe that, do you?

50:00.789 --> 50:05.001
Well, Miss Harris, I have some good news
and some bad news.

50:05.627 --> 50:09.715
The good news, we haven't set up
a system of justice yet.

50:10.173 --> 50:12.300
No courts. No jail.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.302
Bad news?

50:14.720 --> 50:16.930
We haven't set up a system of justice yet,

50:17.013 --> 50:20.600
which means I can do
whatever the hell I want to you.

50:22.728 --> 50:25.355
Sir, we've had a breach.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.899
I don't know. They're asking for you
in the control room.

50:30.193 --> 50:33.321
Sit tight. We are not done.
Not even close.

51:46.353 --> 51:47.437
What is it?

51:53.235 --> 51:54.569
What are you doing with that?

51:56.780 --> 51:57.656
I don't want it.

52:01.326 --> 52:04.663
Wait. Did you make it?

52:05.705 --> 52:07.374
With our printer?

52:08.834 --> 52:09.668
Why?

52:09.751 --> 52:12.587
Danger, Will Robinson.

52:12.671 --> 52:14.798
Danger

52:18.426 --> 52:19.845
That was just a bad dream.

52:20.887 --> 52:24.474
Look...
I know you don't want to hurt me...

52:26.810 --> 52:30.355
but if we're gonna be friends,
you can't hurt anybody.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.399
Ever.

52:34.192 --> 52:35.360
Do you understand?

52:39.656 --> 52:40.657
Good.
