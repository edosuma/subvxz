WEBVTT

00:52.929 --> 00:55.890
Yeah,
we need those reinforced!
Bring some more!

00:58.309 --> 01:00.812
The stake needs retying!

01:03.940 --> 01:06.151
Every other man
on the outer perimeter!

01:10.321 --> 01:11.573
Gate!

01:13.116 --> 01:15.994
Come with me!

01:16.661 --> 01:19.247
Yeah, on all sides.
...very strong defenses.

01:34.012 --> 01:35.430
I need some
more wood over here.

01:35.513 --> 01:37.307
Yeah, on all sides.

01:42.395 --> 01:45.148
Come get your goats!
Chickens!

01:57.160 --> 01:58.203
Who is that man?

01:58.912 --> 02:00.079
I don't know.

02:02.040 --> 02:04.500
He sailed in this morning
with some other traders.

02:05.210 --> 02:08.004
They look, but they don't
want to buy anything.

02:08.087 --> 02:11.549
I ask myself,
why did they bother
to come all this way

02:11.633 --> 02:14.093
if they're not interested
in buying anything?

02:18.181 --> 02:19.849
Attack!

03:05.561 --> 03:07.563
What were they doing?

03:07.647 --> 03:09.774
Looking for
weaknesses in our defenses.

03:10.650 --> 03:12.277
Seems like they found one.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.450
Open the gates!

03:38.094 --> 03:40.221
The Bishop was
in battle with King Aelle.

03:41.639 --> 03:42.807
Dear God.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.892
His Grace is certainly
closer to God right now

03:44.976 --> 03:46.978
than to you,
Prince Aethelwulf.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.066
Put him down!

03:57.030 --> 03:58.031
Who did this to you?

04:00.325 --> 04:01.826
Was it the sons
of Ragnar Lothbrok?

04:02.535 --> 04:05.163
Their army.
How big is their army?
How many warriors?

04:06.456 --> 04:08.458
How many blades of grass

04:10.501 --> 04:12.295
are there in a field?

04:13.087 --> 04:15.798
What does that mean?
Hundreds? Thousands?

04:15.882 --> 04:17.091
Tell me, come on.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.843
Tell me!

04:22.221 --> 04:23.264
Damn you!

04:26.726 --> 04:29.187
And may you rest in peace.

04:37.195 --> 04:41.032
Give the Bishop
a proper and decent
Christian burial.

04:42.075 --> 04:45.453
Even in such times,
we must do what is right.

04:50.666 --> 04:52.543
So, King Aelle is defeated.

04:52.877 --> 04:55.880
Most horribly
and barbarously
put to death, Sire.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.090
So it is said.

04:58.508 --> 05:00.051
Well, I'm sorry to hear it.

05:02.220 --> 05:03.346
For all our sakes.

05:06.182 --> 05:09.310
That great army is doubtless
on its way here already.

05:09.394 --> 05:12.897
I charge you, my son,
to go out and face it.

05:13.106 --> 05:14.982
If it really is as great
as the Bishop suggested,

05:15.066 --> 05:17.443
then I'll need some extra time
to raise more men at arms.

05:17.527 --> 05:20.113
I agree.
But now time itself
is of the essence.

05:20.196 --> 05:22.073
They cannot bring
such a force, on foot,

05:22.156 --> 05:23.991
or by boat,
to Wessex within a week!

05:24.075 --> 05:27.662
Even so,
the element of surprise
is the most valuable asset...

05:27.745 --> 05:30.331
Father! Since
you've given me command,
then let me exercise it!

05:31.416 --> 05:34.627
Father, I want
to fight with you.
As do I!

05:37.338 --> 05:39.590
And I won't risk
the lives of either of you.

05:39.799 --> 05:40.925
You're the future.

05:41.926 --> 05:46.055
My duty is to protect you.
Go to bed. Sleep peacefully.

05:50.268 --> 05:52.520
Good boy. Good boy.

05:56.357 --> 05:58.317
I hope to God
you're right, my son.

05:58.401 --> 06:00.903
For right now,
all the dreams and plans

06:00.987 --> 06:03.781
I had stand in
the greatest jeopardy.

06:04.198 --> 06:06.659
You're not the only one
who had dreams, Father.

06:07.076 --> 06:09.787
If you forgive me,
I have messengers
to dispatch.

06:15.543 --> 06:16.711
Hmm.

06:18.337 --> 06:22.216
If anyone can
save us, it's my son.

06:22.717 --> 06:24.886
I know. He is very brave...

06:26.679 --> 06:28.181
Whatever else he may be.

06:28.514 --> 06:32.643
I urge you again to go
back to him, my love.

06:32.935 --> 06:36.189
He will need the strength
and brilliance of your mind.

06:36.272 --> 06:38.858
You must forgive him
as he must forgive you.

06:39.692 --> 06:43.988
There's no need
to remain attached
to a dying animal like me.

06:45.531 --> 06:46.657
What if I don't want to?

06:49.702 --> 06:53.789
Then I shall
have to command you,
being your King.

06:58.294 --> 06:59.337
My Lady.

07:02.882 --> 07:06.010
Why can't you sleep?
Are you afraid?

07:07.053 --> 07:09.055
No. I'm not afraid.

07:09.138 --> 07:12.183
Good. You have no
reason to be afraid.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.269
Your father watches over you
the whole time.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.690
But you are my father.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.027
I mean your real father.

07:24.737 --> 07:28.908
You know very well.
The monk they
called Athelstan.

07:30.076 --> 07:32.536
Oh, he was a very
holy man, Alfred.

07:33.537 --> 07:34.914
He was a very special man.

07:37.541 --> 07:39.710
He changed all our lives.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.004
You should be
very proud to have
a father like him.

07:43.256 --> 07:45.216
I'm also proud to
have a father like you.

08:03.192 --> 08:04.235
This way!

08:07.113 --> 08:08.739
Come. Quickly.

08:11.867 --> 08:14.370
From the fury of
the Northmen,
O Lord, deliver us!

08:16.706 --> 08:18.749
Quick!

09:13.054 --> 09:15.848
May God in His mercy
bless and keep you.

09:16.390 --> 09:18.392
And may He sow confusion
among His enemies,

09:18.642 --> 09:21.395
and bring you
victory in this Holy War.

09:23.773 --> 09:25.149
Thank you, Father.

09:27.234 --> 09:30.071
Farewell for now.
Fear nothing.

09:30.654 --> 09:34.533
We shall all be together soon.
Praise the Lord.

09:37.370 --> 09:40.581
My husband,
you depart with our love,

09:40.664 --> 09:44.251
and carry our hopes.
Fare you well.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.462
Live, live, and live!

09:46.837 --> 09:52.093
I will try.
As I'll also try
to be worthy of you, Judith.

09:57.181 --> 09:59.767
To everything,
there is a season,

10:00.768 --> 10:03.104
and a time for every
purpose under the sun.

10:03.854 --> 10:06.399
A time to love,
and a time to hate,

10:06.982 --> 10:09.860
a time of war,
and a time of peace.

10:10.027 --> 10:13.030
Now this is the time of war!

10:13.239 --> 10:15.783
This is the time to hate!

10:17.576 --> 10:18.577
My son,

10:19.829 --> 10:23.374
I do beg your forgiveness.

10:24.542 --> 10:27.420
I have been
a very poor father,

10:27.503 --> 10:31.715
but know that I love
you with all my heart.

10:52.987 --> 10:54.738
Let's go.
Move out!

10:54.822 --> 10:56.031
Let's go!

10:56.490 --> 10:59.326
Forward! Align!

11:23.184 --> 11:27.938
It seems to me that
the Saxons are as timid
as frightened women.

11:28.439 --> 11:29.857
Their hearts are faint.

11:30.274 --> 11:32.735
I don't think they
can truly trouble us.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.445
You don't know enough, Ivar.

11:35.196 --> 11:38.949
You haven't seen enough.
These are brave men.

11:40.242 --> 11:42.203
I've fought against them,
you haven't.

11:42.536 --> 11:44.872
I can only see what
my eyes tell me, Bjorn.

11:44.955 --> 11:47.917
And what I see is
frightened people
running before us.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.962
I see their spineless God
running away from our gods.

11:52.296 --> 11:55.925
For once,
why don't you just listen
to an older, wiser brother?

11:56.967 --> 11:59.762
These people who
are running away,
they're not warriors.

12:00.137 --> 12:01.764
They are not
the ones who will stay

12:01.889 --> 12:03.474
and fight to
defend this kingdom.

12:03.557 --> 12:07.019
And protect their honor.
For what is a warrior
without his honor?

12:07.228 --> 12:09.813
I don't know.
You tell me, brother.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.525
And, tell me again,
how many battles
have you fought?

12:14.318 --> 12:15.444
Same as you, brother.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.655
Except I don't ride around in
a comfortable bloody chariot!

12:18.197 --> 12:19.823
What you have to learn, Ivar,

12:19.907 --> 12:23.869
is that if you break
up this brotherhood,
we shall not succeed.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.163
We have many
challenges ahead of us.

12:26.247 --> 12:27.831
So, if you want
to keep arguing

12:27.957 --> 12:29.500
and whining
like a little girl,

12:29.667 --> 12:32.169
then I suggest you leave.
We don't need you.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.504
Oh, but you do need me.

12:33.671 --> 12:36.173
Why do you think
Father chose me
to come with him to England?

12:36.298 --> 12:38.342
He had a reason for doing so.

12:38.676 --> 12:41.637
He told me I was the one
who would act for him,

12:41.887 --> 12:44.473
who would make
sure he was revenged.

12:47.017 --> 12:50.312
If that's
what you want to think,
then think it.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.652
I understand it
must be hard for you

12:56.735 --> 13:00.072
to accept that the true heir
to the great Ragnar Lothbrok

13:00.155 --> 13:02.908
should turn out to be
a cripple and a reject.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.250
So this is what
the grunting of the little
pigs was all about!

13:32.062 --> 13:33.772
No, not there!

13:34.315 --> 13:35.774
Where shall I put them?

13:37.568 --> 13:39.695
Fill your bellies, boys!

13:39.862 --> 13:41.071
He's here!

13:42.114 --> 13:43.282
Lord Aethelwulf!

13:43.365 --> 13:44.867
There he is!

13:45.534 --> 13:47.536
Prince Aethelwulf!

14:01.091 --> 14:04.136
But I need him now!
You'll have to
find him for me.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.387
It's all you'll get today.

14:06.680 --> 14:09.600
What's your estimation
of their strength? Honestly?

14:10.017 --> 14:11.060
Who can tell?

14:12.269 --> 14:14.355
Between three
or four thousand.

14:14.605 --> 14:15.856
That's what it
looked like to me.

14:16.398 --> 14:18.108
We've never seen
anything like this before.

14:18.400 --> 14:22.446
Not a raiding party,
but a great heathen army.

14:22.571 --> 14:23.822
Where were they headed?

14:23.906 --> 14:25.366
They killed King Aelle
near York,

14:25.449 --> 14:28.535
and they're moving south
into the Midlands,
so far towards Repton.

14:28.619 --> 14:31.663
Is it your belief
that they are set upon
attacking my father's kingdom?

14:31.747 --> 14:34.375
That they have
gathered together
to attack Wessex?

14:34.458 --> 14:36.126
There is no doubt in my mind.

14:36.251 --> 14:39.088
These are the sons
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

14:39.463 --> 14:41.048
They want revenge
for the death of their father.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.967
They killed Aelle.

14:44.093 --> 14:46.345
But they know
your father was
complicit in his death.

14:47.513 --> 14:50.432
So it seems inevitable
that they are marching
towards Wessex.

14:50.516 --> 14:51.642
Mmm-hmm.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.311
I believe this man.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.981
I always thought
they would seek revenge
against my father.

14:59.149 --> 15:01.068
So let's move towards Repton.

15:01.693 --> 15:03.654
I think our
destiny awaits us there.

15:07.366 --> 15:08.742
Tanaruz!

15:09.701 --> 15:12.246
Floki, get up!
Floki!

15:12.413 --> 15:13.622
Hmm?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.416
What is it?

15:15.499 --> 15:18.210
She's gone! Tanaruz is gone.

15:20.546 --> 15:22.214
Maybe it's for the better.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.175
What are you talking about?

15:25.384 --> 15:27.594
Something frightened her
and she's run away.

15:27.678 --> 15:28.929
She might be in danger, Floki!

15:29.012 --> 15:33.517
- Floki, we have to find her!
- Where is my darling?

15:35.519 --> 15:37.688
Floki, find her, please.

15:57.291 --> 15:58.292
Tanaruz?

16:53.138 --> 16:54.181
I'm sorry.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.477
You hate us.

17:02.231 --> 17:03.690
I don't know what to do.

17:17.538 --> 17:19.373
Tanaruz! My baby!

17:20.249 --> 17:21.250
My baby!

17:22.292 --> 17:24.127
You're okay,
aren't you?

17:26.505 --> 17:29.424
Come inside. Come inside.

17:54.533 --> 17:55.867
They're here.

18:04.167 --> 18:07.379
Take your positions!

18:07.462 --> 18:08.964
To the wall! Hold the gate!

18:13.302 --> 18:14.636
You two!

18:14.928 --> 18:16.597
Take the tower!

18:20.809 --> 18:22.019
On the wall!

18:37.659 --> 18:40.037
Over there! Close that breach!

19:32.047 --> 19:33.590
To the Great Hall!

19:52.693 --> 19:53.777
Astrid!

19:55.612 --> 19:56.780
We're in the wrong place!

19:57.948 --> 19:59.616
Torvi! Keep them at bay.

20:02.494 --> 20:04.287
Hurry!
Yes!

21:08.602 --> 21:09.686
Forward!

21:48.225 --> 21:49.392
Egil!

21:50.519 --> 21:52.938
Retreat! Let's go! Retreat!

21:53.188 --> 21:55.106
Back! Back to the boats!

22:10.080 --> 22:11.206
Stop!

22:23.176 --> 22:24.261
Ah!

22:28.765 --> 22:30.392
Let him live.

22:36.356 --> 22:40.193
Retreat!
Retreat! Leave him!
Come, retreat! Let's get away!

22:42.696 --> 22:45.365
Let's go! Run!

23:13.351 --> 23:14.811
Leave.

23:23.194 --> 23:28.158
All right. I admit I was
a fool not to kill her.

23:29.993 --> 23:32.913
You were a fool to think
that she would
always wait for you.

23:34.164 --> 23:36.166
You were a fool to
think that she loved you.

23:36.333 --> 23:38.084
How could she
marry that nobody?

23:38.209 --> 23:40.503
Maybe she loves him.
And, if she loves him,

23:42.088 --> 23:43.506
then he is somebody.

23:46.134 --> 23:48.511
How are you
suddenly so wise, brother?

23:49.596 --> 23:53.099
It may have
escaped your attention,
but I am not married myself.

23:53.767 --> 23:54.768
You know why?

23:56.353 --> 23:58.980
I don't understand women
any more than you do.

24:01.983 --> 24:05.862
Women are fickle. Forget her.

24:23.296 --> 24:24.839
Ellisif?

24:27.050 --> 24:28.843
I came to forgive you.

24:31.638 --> 24:34.349
It is not your fault
you could not wait for me.

24:35.642 --> 24:39.270
You probably thought
it was an impossible task
you had set me in any case.

24:39.646 --> 24:41.606
I was never
supposed to achieve it.

24:43.108 --> 24:46.569
You never really
intended to marry me,
did you?

24:48.196 --> 24:49.489
I'm sorry.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.409
I don't even know your name.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.079
My name is Vik,
King Harald.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.331
I am happy to meet you.

24:59.416 --> 25:04.421
Believe me, I knew nothing
of this arrangement
you had with my wife.

25:05.088 --> 25:06.172
Mmm.

25:06.256 --> 25:08.383
But I'm glad that
you have forgiven her.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.844
Mmm.

25:13.096 --> 25:14.973
No! Vik!

25:30.071 --> 25:31.406
Vik.

25:32.282 --> 25:33.783
I'm so sorry.

25:56.264 --> 25:58.808
They say
you are called Egil!

26:00.060 --> 26:04.564
Egil the Bastard.
That's what they call you.

26:07.484 --> 26:11.988
But you are
neither earl nor king.

26:20.705 --> 26:22.832
How could you could
collect such an army?

26:24.959 --> 26:28.880
Who paid for your army,
Egil the Bastard?

26:30.048 --> 26:31.883
Why should I tell you?

26:32.801 --> 26:36.513
You will kill me,
burn me alive,
whether I tell you or not.

26:37.138 --> 26:39.349
That's not true.
Of course it's true!

26:39.516 --> 26:40.683
Don't play games.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.978
As you can see,
I have no time for games.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.398
We found your wife.

27:01.996 --> 27:03.039
Look at her!

27:08.586 --> 27:10.964
We have told her
that if you tell us

27:11.047 --> 27:13.049
who paid for your
fleet and attack,

27:14.384 --> 27:16.261
then we will spare your life.

27:16.678 --> 27:20.431
That you and your wife
can live together again.
Happily.

27:22.517 --> 27:24.060
I don't know this woman.

27:26.980 --> 27:28.565
Just tell them.

27:35.989 --> 27:37.323
Just tell them, Egil!

27:44.330 --> 27:48.126
If I do it, it is for you.
Not for me.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.336
I am dead anyway.

27:51.629 --> 27:53.715
Perhaps they will spare you.

28:00.722 --> 28:03.474
I was paid by
King Harald Finehair.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.962
On! On!
Keep up the pace!

28:38.176 --> 28:39.427
Hold the line!

28:40.845 --> 28:42.013
Line!

28:46.017 --> 28:47.185
Push on!

28:47.894 --> 28:49.646
Pull up on the rear!

28:50.021 --> 28:51.356
Hold your form!

29:04.160 --> 29:05.328
Stop!

29:05.828 --> 29:06.829
Stop!

29:06.913 --> 29:07.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:08.665 --> 29:09.749
Halt!

29:13.962 --> 29:15.213
What news?

29:15.296 --> 29:17.131
The Saxons are less
than a day's ride away.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.258
They have a large army.

29:21.177 --> 29:22.428
We'll make camp here.

29:23.680 --> 29:24.931
Tomorrow we shall fight.

29:25.181 --> 29:29.227
In the name of our father,
we shall overcome.

29:32.438 --> 29:33.523
Make camp!

29:33.648 --> 29:35.483
Make camp here!

29:37.276 --> 29:38.569
You can make camp.

29:39.529 --> 29:42.365
I want to take a look
at where we're going to fight.

29:42.615 --> 29:43.950
What are you talking about?

29:44.033 --> 29:46.953
They will expect us
to fight in a certain way.

29:47.412 --> 29:48.705
Why should we do that?

29:49.539 --> 29:53.501
Why don't we plan to fight
in a different way,
and surprise them?

29:58.423 --> 30:00.216
Our warriors won't understand
what's happening.

30:01.175 --> 30:03.553
We fight in the shield wall.
That's how we fight.

30:03.636 --> 30:05.805
But we have a bigger army now.

30:05.888 --> 30:08.307
And they have a bigger
army, now, Hvitserk.

30:08.391 --> 30:09.851
We cannot
fight in the same way.

30:10.059 --> 30:11.436
It's too late to change now.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.438
Who are you to say that?
Shut your mouth.

30:13.521 --> 30:14.939
We are brothers.

30:17.567 --> 30:18.609
Together.

30:22.196 --> 30:23.823
Why do you want to
change the tactics?

30:23.906 --> 30:26.075
Do you want to win, brother?

30:31.914 --> 30:35.251
Listen, come with me, Bjorn.

30:36.586 --> 30:38.588
Let's investigate
the battlefield.

30:39.047 --> 30:42.300
Perhaps, instead of
a narrow and small place,

30:42.383 --> 30:44.177
we should
stretch the battlefield

30:44.260 --> 30:45.970
across a large area,
many miles.

30:46.137 --> 30:50.308
And use the landscape.
Ditches, hills, woods.

30:55.063 --> 30:56.522
What do you say?

30:58.691 --> 31:01.944
If it works,
it is a good plan.

31:04.030 --> 31:07.116
If it doesn't,
then it is a bad plan.

31:20.254 --> 31:21.923
Tie the horses together!

31:22.006 --> 31:24.092
What are you waiting for?

31:24.675 --> 31:25.885
Ha!

31:44.403 --> 31:45.822
Can I talk to you?

32:28.531 --> 32:29.866
Talk.

32:31.367 --> 32:34.745
I made a mistake.
I'm so sorry.
I should have waited.

32:35.538 --> 32:37.331
I never loved him.
I loved you.

32:38.291 --> 32:41.878
But people persuaded me.
They lied to me.
Can you understand?

32:43.045 --> 32:45.047
Your dream seemed
such a long time away.

32:48.092 --> 32:50.511
But I was wrong, so wrong!
I should have waited!

32:52.597 --> 32:54.056
And now I see why.

32:55.057 --> 32:57.727
You are
going to do exactly
what you said you would do.

33:00.062 --> 33:02.356
And I should
have believed you.

33:04.400 --> 33:08.404
And I believe you now.
Forgive me.

34:01.999 --> 34:04.043
Seems like, after all,

34:05.002 --> 34:08.130
I know women
a lot better
than you, brother!

34:45.793 --> 34:46.836
Onward!

34:48.170 --> 34:49.338
Keep up!

34:55.678 --> 34:57.013
Stay straight!

35:08.691 --> 35:10.860
Keep your colors held high!

35:25.708 --> 35:27.626
Stay alert!

35:53.986 --> 35:54.987
Ha!

36:04.413 --> 36:05.956
Forward!
Forward!

36:08.667 --> 36:10.086
Captain! Flank!

36:11.754 --> 36:14.006
You men! Follow me left!
Follow!

36:15.091 --> 36:16.217
Keep your eyes on them!

36:16.383 --> 36:17.676
Go! Get up! Come!

36:17.760 --> 36:19.011
Right on me!

36:50.626 --> 36:51.794
Sire!

37:01.053 --> 37:02.346
Turn around!

37:02.805 --> 37:05.599
Around face! Full turn!

37:20.197 --> 37:21.574
After them!

37:21.991 --> 37:23.325
Keep moving!

37:27.788 --> 37:28.831
Stay together!

37:36.630 --> 37:39.175
Turn! Turn around!
Turn back! Turn back!

37:41.927 --> 37:44.013
Turn! Turn around!

37:46.140 --> 37:47.266
Shield wall!

37:48.851 --> 37:50.686
Shield wall! Get together!

37:55.191 --> 37:56.525
Formation!

38:01.488 --> 38:02.698
Advance!

38:07.453 --> 38:08.495
Stay together!

38:14.043 --> 38:15.085
Advance!

38:16.253 --> 38:17.296
Forward!

39:08.013 --> 39:10.766
Prince Aethelwulf?
Prince Aethelwulf?

39:34.540 --> 39:36.083
Mmm...

39:36.166 --> 39:37.334
Four blasts.

39:39.003 --> 39:40.462
If you say so.

39:56.186 --> 39:57.271
Hurry!

40:02.359 --> 40:03.444
Yes!

40:15.122 --> 40:16.123
Hyah!

40:31.889 --> 40:33.182
There they are, My Lord!

40:34.767 --> 40:35.893
Wait!

40:39.188 --> 40:40.522
Whoa.

40:47.696 --> 40:51.658
I'll not be their fool
or their dupe any longer!

40:54.036 --> 40:55.954
You say they left
their ships at Repton?

40:56.080 --> 40:57.581
Yes, My Lord Aethelwulf.

40:58.248 --> 41:00.125
In which direction is Repton?

41:02.878 --> 41:04.546
Then that's
where we're going.

41:05.047 --> 41:08.550
And if we reach Repton first,
and destroy their ships,

41:08.884 --> 41:11.220
then we shall have
the better of this battle!

41:11.470 --> 41:14.681
But we must move fast,
and keep them behind us!

41:14.765 --> 41:15.933
Move!

41:24.066 --> 41:27.277
What are they doing?
Where are they going?

41:30.406 --> 41:31.990
To Repton, I imagine.

41:38.747 --> 41:39.832
To the boats?

41:41.250 --> 41:42.543
They are going for our boats?

41:45.087 --> 41:49.258
You crippled bastard!
You were right!

41:51.009 --> 41:55.097
You were right!
Oh, you bloody mad genius.
You were right!

42:18.704 --> 42:20.456
Stay down!
Get in lines!

42:21.874 --> 42:23.625
Cover the ridge! On the ridge!

42:25.419 --> 42:27.296
Shields!

42:29.882 --> 42:32.092
Close up! Close up!

42:33.969 --> 42:35.262
Pull together!

42:35.345 --> 42:36.597
Mind your back!

43:10.172 --> 43:11.173
Shield wall!

43:15.677 --> 43:17.679
Charge!
