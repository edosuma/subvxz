WEBVTT

00:05.680 --> 00:07.213
You should go.

00:09.707 --> 00:11.452
It's your engagement party tomorrow.

00:11.477 --> 00:12.987
Right. Right.

00:13.011 --> 00:15.164
Engagement party, less than 24 hours.

00:15.534 --> 00:16.824
Good call.

00:17.398 --> 00:18.515
Yeah.

00:20.265 --> 00:23.539
Uh, I'm sorry for just
stopping by like this. Um...

00:23.564 --> 00:25.141
It's okay.

00:25.166 --> 00:26.757
I hope I helped.

00:26.782 --> 00:28.257
You did.

00:28.282 --> 00:29.695
You always do.

00:31.539 --> 00:32.930
Good night, Zoey.

00:33.617 --> 00:34.950
Good...

00:36.435 --> 00:37.701
night.

00:52.415 --> 00:53.415
Hello.

00:54.753 --> 00:57.054
And how's your morning going?

00:57.258 --> 01:00.334
Um, okay.

01:00.554 --> 01:01.804
Why are you smirking?

01:01.829 --> 01:04.078
Because I saw Simon

01:04.102 --> 01:07.289
go into your apartment
late at night alone.

01:07.314 --> 01:09.671
Right. Well, then, you also missed him

01:09.696 --> 01:13.703
leaving my apartment
about 10 minutes later, alone.

01:13.728 --> 01:15.796
- Mm.
- He just wanted to talk.

01:15.821 --> 01:17.417
Ooh, that's it?

01:17.442 --> 01:18.976
Nothing else happened?

01:19.001 --> 01:22.851
No. Mo! He is an engaged man.

01:22.876 --> 01:24.854
I meant did he sing to you?

01:24.879 --> 01:26.344
And you have to make
everything so sexual.

01:26.368 --> 01:27.779
Don't you know you're in
the presence of a lady?

01:27.803 --> 01:29.281
He sang to me.

01:29.306 --> 01:31.857
He sang "Should I Stay or Should I Go."

01:31.882 --> 01:33.617
And you told him he should...

01:33.642 --> 01:35.506
- Go.
- Either way, it's trouble.

01:35.531 --> 01:36.704
It says it right there in the song.

01:36.728 --> 01:38.639
Is it trouble, though?

01:38.664 --> 01:40.563
He was only thinking about staying.

01:42.784 --> 01:44.411
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:44.436 --> 01:45.861
It's Jessica, Simon's fiancée.

01:45.886 --> 01:47.517
Like I said, trouble.

01:47.542 --> 01:48.853
Why would she even be texting you?

01:48.877 --> 01:49.916
Do you think it's about last night?

01:49.940 --> 01:51.018
What do I do? Do I text her back?

01:51.042 --> 01:52.611
No! You do not text her back.

01:52.636 --> 01:54.948
You stay as far away from
this phone as possible.

01:54.973 --> 01:55.983
Ow.

01:56.783 --> 01:58.293
Is this a protractor?

01:58.317 --> 01:59.828
Maybe.

01:59.852 --> 02:00.884
Bye.

02:03.673 --> 02:05.455
Basically I just told Autumn

02:05.480 --> 02:07.301
I didn't think we were
on the same wavelength,

02:07.326 --> 02:09.904
and then I said a bunch of
stuff about paths and journeys,

02:09.929 --> 02:12.150
and we decided to go our separate ways.

02:12.175 --> 02:13.854
So everything's cool
between the two of you?

02:13.878 --> 02:16.109
Oh, yeah. As far as
breakups are concerned,

02:16.134 --> 02:18.408
I think it went well, really well.

02:18.433 --> 02:21.378
Like, if there were awards
for breakups, the Breakies,

02:21.403 --> 02:23.457
I'd at least get a nomination.

02:23.956 --> 02:27.095
Well, I'm glad things ended
on such a positive note.

You always get the usual.

02:41.573 --> 02:43.681
I do, I do, but this time,

02:43.706 --> 02:45.685
I'm thinking maybe I switch
things up a little bit.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.454
Like, I've always considered
myself a purist

02:47.479 --> 02:48.856
when it comes to java consumption,

02:48.881 --> 02:50.759
but there are so many
libations on this menu,

02:50.784 --> 02:53.400
and it's like, is this the day
when I try my first chai tea?

02:53.425 --> 02:55.382
Or, ooh, an iced latte maybe?

02:55.634 --> 02:56.852
I don't know. What do you think, Autz?

02:56.876 --> 02:58.415
I think Autumn's busy.

02:58.440 --> 03:00.415
We've taken up enough of her time.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.689
- I'll have the usual.
- Yeah, and I'll just have

03:02.714 --> 03:06.680

04:15.753 --> 04:17.841
"Max... imum A-hole?"

04:17.867 --> 04:20.250
Wait. Is this someone else's drink?

04:20.276 --> 04:21.627
Pretty sure that's yours.

04:21.652 --> 04:22.951
Autumn?

04:23.795 --> 04:26.205
Hey, A-Autumn? Something wrong?

04:26.230 --> 04:28.994
Are you kidding? You dumped me.

04:29.019 --> 04:33.337
Well, yeah, but didn't we
both agree that it was, like,

04:33.362 --> 04:34.673
the best breakup ever?

04:34.698 --> 04:36.432
- And then there's, like...
- No. We didn't agree.

04:36.456 --> 04:38.150
You totally blindsided me.

04:38.175 --> 04:41.415
Then you come back into my
coffee shop the very next day?

04:41.651 --> 04:43.595
Did you really think you
could just end things

04:43.620 --> 04:45.392
and we'd pretend like it never happened?

04:45.760 --> 04:47.626
Y-Yeah?

04:48.306 --> 04:49.950
I'm glad we broke up.

04:49.975 --> 04:52.053
You're a self-important,
arrogant nerd who dresses

04:52.078 --> 04:54.900
like a third grader, and I never
want to see you in here again.

05:01.887 --> 05:03.197
She's wrong.

05:03.222 --> 05:05.300
You are not arrogant.

05:05.325 --> 05:08.626
But we are going to have to
find a new favorite coffee shop.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.790
This is terrible.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.658
You talking about the
girl or the coffee shop?

05:18.683 --> 05:20.294
I don't know, both.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.631
Sometimes I just feel like
I can't do anything right.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.955
_

05:44.142 --> 05:45.853
Hello.

05:46.009 --> 05:47.798
Someone sounds like
they're in a good mood.

05:47.823 --> 05:50.728
I am. I'm setting up for
Simon and Jessica's party.

05:50.753 --> 05:53.360
I cannot wait for you
to see this place, honey.

05:53.385 --> 05:57.939
That's, uh, exactly why I am calling.

05:57.964 --> 05:59.212
Um...

06:00.298 --> 06:02.198
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it tonight.

06:02.222 --> 06:03.366
Oh, no.

06:03.391 --> 06:05.337
Oh, I'm so sorry. I was...

06:05.362 --> 06:07.665
I was really looking
forward to hanging with you.

06:07.690 --> 06:10.047
I know. Me, too,
but I will see you soon.

06:10.072 --> 06:11.173
I don't know if you've noticed,

06:11.197 --> 06:12.915
but I tend to hang
out at your house a lot.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.587
- <i>Who's gonna be with Dad tonight?</i>
- Oh, Paul is coming in

06:15.612 --> 06:17.353
from Portland to spend the weekend.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.705
Oh, great. I love Paul.
That'll make Dad happy.

06:20.730 --> 06:22.489
<i>Oh, wait. Can you just
check with Jessica</i>

06:22.514 --> 06:25.337
to see if she likes those before
I put them out? Thank you.

06:25.362 --> 06:27.611
Are you with Jessica right now?
Does she seem upset?

06:27.636 --> 06:30.665
No, but she did ask
for your number earlier.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.212
- <i>Why didn't she ask Simon?</i>
- Do you want me to ask her?

06:33.237 --> 06:34.648
No! Nope.

06:34.673 --> 06:36.717
Um, listen, Mom, I gotta work.

06:36.742 --> 06:39.476
Uh, have fun tonight. You've earned it.

06:44.479 --> 06:47.234
Bro, it's gonna be an open bar,

06:47.259 --> 06:49.298
and you know Simon's
a top-shelf kinda guy,

06:49.323 --> 06:52.259
Wait. Simon invited you guys
to his engagement party, too?

06:52.284 --> 06:54.495
Why? You can't believe Simon would
have friends as cool as us?

06:54.519 --> 06:57.462
Yeah, that's where my confusion lies.

06:57.487 --> 06:59.226
If you must know, we taught Si-Si

06:59.251 --> 07:00.853
how to beat Galaga in the game area,

07:00.878 --> 07:02.065
and we've been tight ever since.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.533
Have you ever called
him Si-Si to his face?

07:04.558 --> 07:06.687
We are building to that.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.384
People, I keep telling you,

07:09.409 --> 07:12.275
I need to hear the next big idea.

07:12.300 --> 07:13.345
What have you got for me?

07:13.370 --> 07:14.948
Joan, right here. I got this "robot dog

07:14.973 --> 07:17.181
that can tell the weather"
idea in my back pocket.

07:17.206 --> 07:18.587
Okay, keep it in your back pocket.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.415
I don't get it.
How hard can it be to come up

07:20.440 --> 07:23.564
with something game-changing,
brilliant, and revolutionary?

07:23.763 --> 07:26.251
The world is waiting. So am I.

07:26.369 --> 07:29.080
Zoey, uh, I have
another work thing for you.

07:29.105 --> 07:30.416
Come.

07:30.892 --> 07:32.093
Why a robot dog?

07:32.117 --> 07:34.095
Why not just a robot?
What, do you have to walk it?

07:34.119 --> 07:35.952
Yeah. That's how it charges.

07:37.554 --> 07:39.953
I lied. It's not about work.
What are you doing tonight?

07:39.978 --> 07:41.189
- Me?
- Yeah.

07:41.214 --> 07:44.251
Oh, I was planning on going
to Simon's engagement party,

07:44.276 --> 07:46.154
but that's no longer the case.

07:46.179 --> 07:47.724
Okay, yeah, I was invited to that, too,

07:47.748 --> 07:49.362
but I have no interest in
hanging out with a bunch

07:49.386 --> 07:51.837
of 20-somethings talking about
artisanal beer all night.

07:51.862 --> 07:53.674
In our defense,
we also talk about nut milk.

07:53.699 --> 07:55.619
Um, but I do want to do something,

07:55.644 --> 07:58.140
since I am celebrating.

07:58.165 --> 08:00.962
I just signed my divorce
papers this morning.

08:01.869 --> 08:04.991
So, it's pretty exciting,

08:05.016 --> 08:07.094
and since you're free, I'll send a car.

08:07.357 --> 08:09.232
I'm sorry. You'll...

08:09.537 --> 08:11.662
send a car to me?

08:11.687 --> 08:14.201
Yes, so that we don't have
to worry about driving and...

08:14.226 --> 08:16.834
So we can go out together,
the two of us?

08:16.859 --> 08:18.795
I don't know why this got weird,

08:19.256 --> 08:20.349
but yeah.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.545
I'll see you tonight.

08:21.570 --> 08:23.003
That sounds good.

08:31.198 --> 08:32.342
You busy?

08:32.366 --> 08:34.068
Just working on a speech for tonight.

08:34.092 --> 08:36.138
Um, I got some time.

08:36.163 --> 08:37.929
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

08:39.197 --> 08:41.770
I was just wondering, um,

08:41.796 --> 08:44.802
what did you tell
Jessica about last night?

08:44.827 --> 08:46.170
I didn't tell her anything. Why?

08:46.195 --> 08:48.973
'Cause she's been texting
and calling me all morning.

08:48.998 --> 08:51.137
- She has?
- Mm-hmm.

08:51.615 --> 08:52.646
And did you answer her?

08:52.671 --> 08:54.449
No. I wanted to talk to you first.

08:55.349 --> 08:57.578
I guess she could have woke up

08:57.602 --> 08:59.108
while I was at your
place and got suspicious.

08:59.132 --> 09:03.590
Or maybe she tracked my
phone and saw where I was.

09:03.615 --> 09:04.670
I don't know about that.

09:04.695 --> 09:07.007
I just know that it's making
me a little bit uncomfortable,

09:07.031 --> 09:08.875
which is why I've decided

09:08.900 --> 09:12.836
that I'm not going to go
to your engagement party.

09:14.043 --> 09:17.097
Ah. Okay.

09:17.122 --> 09:18.248
I guess that makes sense.

09:18.273 --> 09:19.584
Um, tell you what.

09:19.609 --> 09:21.912
Don't get back to Jessica just yet.

09:22.135 --> 09:23.935
I'll talk to her, see what's up.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.127
Okay. Great talk.

09:28.331 --> 09:31.177
And have fun tonight.

09:31.685 --> 09:33.826
And eat a pig in a blanket for me.

09:33.851 --> 09:35.896
There will be pigs in a blanket,
won't there?

09:35.921 --> 09:37.584
Zoey, this is a classy affair.

09:37.609 --> 09:39.220
Of course there'll be pigs in a blanket.

09:39.548 --> 09:41.348
- Cool.
- Yeah.

09:46.433 --> 09:48.199
Hi. Hello.

09:48.224 --> 09:49.746
Jessica.

09:49.771 --> 09:53.287
Wow, you're here at my office,
where I work.

09:53.312 --> 09:55.920
Where we all work. That's great.
It's so great to see you.

09:55.945 --> 09:57.466
- Are you looking for Simon? He's...
- Zoey.

09:57.490 --> 09:59.468
I really need to talk
to you for a minute.

10:00.633 --> 10:01.777
Alone.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.312
Absolutely. Sounds good.

10:03.337 --> 10:05.371
Um, right this way.

10:06.041 --> 10:07.173
Oh...

Synced & corrected by QueenMaddie
www.addic7ed.com

10:11.998 --> 10:14.795
So, what can I do you for madam.

10:14.977 --> 10:18.954
Well, here's the thing.

10:22.150 --> 10:24.195
I've planned a little surprise for Simon

10:24.219 --> 10:26.920
at the party tonight,
and I need your help.

10:28.223 --> 10:30.134
That's why you've been calling me?

10:30.751 --> 10:33.470
Oh, I didn't call you back,
because I've been in meetings.

10:33.495 --> 10:35.476
- Oh.
- So many meetings.

10:35.501 --> 10:37.708
I'm so sorry to hit you up
like this out of nowhere.

10:37.732 --> 10:40.462
- You must think I'm a crazy person.
- Not at all.

10:40.487 --> 10:42.336
Are you crazy? You just asked.

10:42.361 --> 10:43.984
No. Wow.

10:44.595 --> 10:46.217
Let's...

10:46.241 --> 10:48.708
talk about it in the conference room.

10:50.979 --> 10:53.376
I should've... should've
given you space.

10:53.401 --> 10:55.559
I understand everyone has
their own journey and...

10:55.584 --> 10:58.048
But if we... if our journeys
take us to the same place,

10:58.073 --> 10:59.829
I want to know that we're on good terms.

10:59.854 --> 11:01.346
And we all have different... I mean...

11:01.370 --> 11:03.300
Max? Why are you pacing around

11:03.325 --> 11:05.166
like that time my daddy
took me shopping for prom?

11:05.190 --> 11:06.674
I'm just trying to figure
out what to say to Autumn

11:06.698 --> 11:07.931
when I go back in there.

11:07.956 --> 11:10.736
I broke up with her,
and she's super angry.

11:10.761 --> 11:13.674
Is that why she wrote "No Mo"
on the side of my cup?

11:13.962 --> 11:15.680
- I guess so.
- And you're returning

11:15.704 --> 11:18.111
to the scene of the crime
because you want to...

11:18.136 --> 11:19.649
Apologize?

11:19.674 --> 11:21.519
I don't want her to hate me.

11:21.543 --> 11:23.829
Let me get this straight.
You're coming back to make sure

11:23.854 --> 11:26.609
that she's okay with the fact
that you're still dumping her?

11:26.634 --> 11:27.825
Yeah, I guess so.

11:27.849 --> 11:30.494
- Straight people.
- I just... She called me

11:30.518 --> 11:32.806
a self-important nerd who
dresses like a third grader.

11:32.831 --> 11:34.844
Oh, honey, you're not self-important.

11:34.869 --> 11:36.701
If you ask me,
you need to goodbye that girl

11:36.725 --> 11:37.783
and get on with your life,

11:37.808 --> 11:40.136
and that starts with
a little Mo swagger.

11:40.161 --> 11:42.712
Like more swagger or... Or Mo swagger?

11:42.737 --> 11:44.875
Exactly. Now it's time for a makeover,

11:44.900 --> 11:46.878
which is literally my
favorite thing to do.

11:46.902 --> 11:48.765
Take that jacket off, and throw it out.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.400
Throw it out.

11:50.425 --> 11:52.025
Oh, you really mean it.

11:52.923 --> 11:54.415
All right.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.084
Like, there's nowhere to...

11:56.109 --> 11:57.353
Put it there?

11:59.486 --> 12:01.531
- Stop looking at it.
- Okay. Well...

12:01.556 --> 12:03.846
I've still got a million things
to take care of before tonight,

12:03.870 --> 12:06.142
but I also put together
a last-minute surprise

12:06.167 --> 12:09.246
for Simon, because, well,
like I said, crazy person.

12:09.271 --> 12:12.484
And I'm realizing I could
use a little Zoey wisdom.

12:12.634 --> 12:14.984
Simon says you give the best advice.

12:15.009 --> 12:16.590
- Oh.
- I made him a slideshow.

12:16.615 --> 12:19.283
It's very basic.
I'm not a computer whiz like you.

12:19.308 --> 12:23.789
Eh. I prefer the term
"computer wiz-zard."

12:24.095 --> 12:26.550
Right. Well, uh, the thing is,

12:26.574 --> 12:29.020
it's got all these pictures
from our relationship

12:29.044 --> 12:31.993
and our childhoods, and, ah,

12:32.017 --> 12:33.757
isn't Simon adorable?

12:34.415 --> 12:36.661
Oh, this is where I need you,

12:36.685 --> 12:38.431
the ones with his dad.

12:38.456 --> 12:42.892
I just... I'm not sure
if I should include them.

12:42.917 --> 12:45.429
I really want to honor
his father, but I just, I-I...

12:45.773 --> 12:47.921
I don't know if this is the best way.

12:48.484 --> 12:50.528
It's tricky. I get it.

12:51.444 --> 12:52.943
I know you do.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.640
Gosh, I feel terrible about your father.

12:55.665 --> 12:56.948
Oh, God, if I'd been going through

12:56.972 --> 12:58.243
what you've been going through,
I probably would have

12:58.267 --> 13:00.745
jumped off the Golden
Gate Bridge by now.

13:01.398 --> 13:03.421
It's... I am so sorry.

13:03.446 --> 13:04.577
- No, no.
- I... See?

13:04.602 --> 13:05.616
This is the problem.

13:05.641 --> 13:08.663
No matter how hard I try,
I just never say the right thing.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.700
I just feel like I'm
failing Simon all the time.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.452
But tonight,

13:14.070 --> 13:16.070
I really want to get it right.

13:17.825 --> 13:20.242
Navigating grief is really hard.

13:21.351 --> 13:23.151
But, um...

13:24.557 --> 13:26.710
I think you should include these photos.

13:26.735 --> 13:28.746
They're beautiful and emotional,

13:28.770 --> 13:29.985
but I don't think that's a bad thing.

13:30.009 --> 13:34.281
I think it's good to keep
Simon's dad alive somehow.

13:35.337 --> 13:37.085
Gosh, you just...

13:37.110 --> 13:38.601
get it.

13:38.734 --> 13:39.734
It's weird.

13:39.759 --> 13:42.038
I'm usually extremely
jealous around other women,

13:42.063 --> 13:44.546
like a full-on psychopath.

13:45.218 --> 13:46.731
But with you, I'm...

13:47.255 --> 13:48.632
I can't wait for you

13:48.657 --> 13:50.304
to see the wall of
roses your mother made.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.169
Oh, my goodness. It's just incredible.

13:53.194 --> 13:57.174
Actually, it's a huge bummer,
but I can't make it tonight.

13:57.198 --> 13:59.410
There was a last-minute
emergency with my boss.

13:59.687 --> 14:01.632
That's a shame.

14:01.657 --> 14:03.935
Well, we'll miss you,

14:03.960 --> 14:06.781
but of course I totally understand.

14:13.007 --> 14:15.545
You remember when
we took the kids fishing

14:15.570 --> 14:20.257
at the greatest watering hole
in the whole entire world?

14:20.555 --> 14:22.716
What was that place called again?

14:23.580 --> 14:25.535
June! June Lake.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.204
Yeah.

14:27.228 --> 14:29.513
You still have got a
better memory than me.

14:29.538 --> 14:31.913
We didn't catch anything at that place.

14:33.274 --> 14:34.851
I love hearing you two laugh.

14:34.876 --> 14:36.086
Oh, you gotta laugh, Mags.

14:36.111 --> 14:37.367
You always gotta laugh.

14:37.392 --> 14:40.383
All right, you guys.
Well, have fun tonight.

14:40.408 --> 14:42.386
And, you, too.
Can't wait to hear how much

14:42.410 --> 14:46.023
everyone loves your flowers,
so take a zillion pictures.

14:46.047 --> 14:48.234
Okay. Thanks, Paul.

14:48.259 --> 14:50.024
I love you, honey.

14:51.169 --> 14:52.702
Okay.

14:58.373 --> 15:01.632
Hey, Mags, seriously,

15:01.657 --> 15:03.695
I don't want you back until midnight.

15:03.720 --> 15:06.287
I've got the whole
bedtime routine laced up.

15:06.312 --> 15:09.024
Just... enjoy yourself.

15:10.605 --> 15:12.335
I will do my best.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.093
- That's good.
- Okay.

15:14.805 --> 15:17.281
Okay, thanks, Paul.

15:20.745 --> 15:23.326
Guess what. Good news.

15:23.351 --> 15:25.373
You finally bought a dress. Mm.

15:25.398 --> 15:26.657
At least let me help you accessorize.

15:26.681 --> 15:28.968
No, that wasn't my news.
The news is that I actually

15:28.993 --> 15:31.267
am not in trouble.
Jessica just needed some help.

15:31.292 --> 15:32.601
Are you still planning on going

15:32.626 --> 15:34.351
to Simon's engagement party?

15:34.826 --> 15:36.843
- Playing with fire.
- No.

15:36.868 --> 15:38.952
I am going for drinks with Joan,

15:38.977 --> 15:40.538
and the car should be here any minute.

15:40.563 --> 15:43.046
- Oh, fun.
- If you say so.

15:43.071 --> 15:44.367
What are you doing tonight?

15:44.392 --> 15:47.604
I am going to Simon's engagement party.

15:47.629 --> 15:48.940
Max needed a wingman.

15:48.965 --> 15:50.960
- Who?
- Hey, Mo, uh...

15:51.343 --> 15:54.059
Oh, hey, Zoey.
I didn't hear you come in.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.115
And I'm...

15:57.377 --> 15:59.348
staring at your nipples.

16:00.821 --> 16:02.857
I don't think I've ever seen
you with your shirt off before.

16:02.881 --> 16:05.081
Are you... secret buff?

16:05.106 --> 16:07.591
I've been dabbling in the
muscular arts a little bit.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.038
Yeah, sure.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.341
Don't judge.

16:10.366 --> 16:11.977
You caught us mid-makeover.

16:12.002 --> 16:13.002
Yeah.

16:14.283 --> 16:16.137
You look nice, though.

16:16.162 --> 16:17.887
Joan's a very lucky lady.

16:17.912 --> 16:21.451
Well, I'm sorry I won't get
to see you two in action.

16:21.476 --> 16:22.934
That's really too bad.

16:23.618 --> 16:26.036
Hey, Zoey, my eyes are up here.

16:28.265 --> 16:29.759
Peace out, peeps.

16:29.948 --> 16:31.281
Peace.

16:34.830 --> 16:36.567
Gotta admit, this is kinda fun.

16:36.592 --> 16:37.602
Uh-huh.

16:39.334 --> 16:41.536
Just so I know, what kind
of night do you have in mind?

16:41.561 --> 16:43.559
We talking a nice glass of wine

16:43.584 --> 16:45.458
or a bunch of Skinnygirl Margs

16:45.483 --> 16:47.083
and then going to
ride a mechanical bull?

16:47.427 --> 16:49.559
Relax, Zoey. We're just two single girls

16:49.584 --> 16:51.536
out on the town
celebrating a recent divorce

16:51.561 --> 16:53.439
with a couple of after-work drinks.

16:53.464 --> 16:55.950
I just want a calm, civilized evening.

and couple of shots?

18:12.098 --> 18:14.442
Uh, sure, I could do a shot.

18:14.467 --> 18:16.722
Oh, you want one, too?
Um, make that four.

18:16.747 --> 18:18.190
Sure thing.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.661
Now they just taste like water.

18:28.686 --> 18:31.700
And you know, that's when
the night gots interesting.

18:31.725 --> 18:33.052
Who do we know with a hot tub?

18:33.077 --> 18:36.044
Wow, you are really
in it to win it, huh?

18:36.069 --> 18:38.387
Yeah. I'm making up for lost time,

18:38.412 --> 18:39.790
all those years I wasted

18:39.815 --> 18:42.005
sitting at home, waiting for Charlie.

18:42.030 --> 18:44.842
And the irony is, when we met,
I was the fun one,

18:44.867 --> 18:46.919
and now he's probably out, you know,

18:46.944 --> 18:49.550
with models or the daughters of models,

18:49.575 --> 18:52.495
- and somehow, oh, I'm boring?
- Mmmmm.

18:52.520 --> 18:53.662
Is there something wrong with me?

18:53.686 --> 18:55.669
No, there is nothing wrong with you.

18:55.694 --> 18:57.825
You are super fun,

18:57.850 --> 19:01.911
like, sloppy,
dance-on-a-bar kind of fun.

19:01.936 --> 19:04.052
Thank you! See? You get me.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.847
No one at the office thinks I'm fun.

19:05.872 --> 19:08.152
Oh, that's because they
only see you in work mode,

19:08.176 --> 19:11.243
but they would love the fun you.

19:12.074 --> 19:14.362
That is a great idea.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.135
- Um, can we get the check, please?
- Wait. What did I say?

19:16.159 --> 19:17.966
We're going to Simon's party.

19:18.587 --> 19:19.864
Oh, uh...

19:19.889 --> 19:23.099
I am pretty drunk already.

19:23.124 --> 19:24.575
I think I should call it a night.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.325
Zoey, this is my first night out

19:26.350 --> 19:28.786
as a single woman in 20 years.

19:29.075 --> 19:30.903
We are going to that party.
That's final.

19:30.928 --> 19:33.262
Can I please get the bill? Tick-tock.

19:44.255 --> 19:48.903
Okay. This is a par-tay.

19:48.927 --> 19:52.575
Let's find those guys and show
those losers how to do it.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.574
Yes, you should. I'm just gonna hydrate

19:54.599 --> 19:55.973
- and try to sober up first.
- Ooh.

19:55.998 --> 19:57.309
'Cause I'm real drunk right now.

19:57.334 --> 19:59.512
Hi, Toblerone.

19:59.537 --> 20:02.482
What's up, Leif Stroganoff? Boop, boop.

20:02.507 --> 20:03.794
Did you just give us nicknames?

20:03.819 --> 20:04.903
Yeah, 'cause I'm fun.

20:04.928 --> 20:07.239
Let's, uh, get our asses to the bar.

20:08.444 --> 20:10.256
Were you pre-gaming with Joan?

20:10.281 --> 20:11.434
I cannot believe the lengths

20:11.459 --> 20:13.223
you're willing to go to
get in with our boss.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.364
And I cannot believe
you're dressed as...

20:15.389 --> 20:17.817
Shaggy wearing Scooby-Doo.

20:18.130 --> 20:21.202
So tell me, Shags,
where are those pigs in a blanket?

20:21.226 --> 20:22.591
They're...

20:23.264 --> 20:25.505
they're in the kitchen.
Okay, you know what?

20:25.653 --> 20:27.723
And remember the plan, Maxwell.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.143
Keep the conversation
light with the ladies,

20:29.167 --> 20:30.182
and if you bring up Autumn,

20:30.206 --> 20:32.106
I will shove my heel so
far down your throat...

20:32.131 --> 20:33.546
My, you're kinda mean, aren't you?

20:33.571 --> 20:35.049
When I have to be.

20:35.073 --> 20:36.550
Oh, look at this place.

20:36.574 --> 20:39.919
Gotta say,
Jessica's got a lot of cute friends.

20:39.944 --> 20:42.137
Hmm. That she does.

20:42.449 --> 20:44.575
- Hey.
- Hi.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.497
And I'm not mad at it.

20:52.248 --> 20:53.712
Okay, there it is. There it is.

20:53.744 --> 20:54.971
Ah!

21:04.344 --> 21:06.213
Paul?

21:06.237 --> 21:07.883
Hey, wh-what's going on?

21:07.908 --> 21:09.649
We're at the club. Can't talk,

21:09.674 --> 21:12.446
because we're just having
way too much fun, huh?

21:12.471 --> 21:14.288
- Right, pal?
- <i>Sounds like a good time,</i>

21:14.313 --> 21:16.257
um, but did you remember to give him...

21:16.281 --> 21:18.926
<i>To give him his nighttime
medication? Well, uh, yeah.</i>

21:18.950 --> 21:20.642
I mean, if his nighttime medication

21:20.667 --> 21:23.242
is a bottle of Jack and
some 'shrooms, then...

21:23.267 --> 21:24.532
why, yes,

21:24.556 --> 21:26.330
'cause we are tripping up in here.

21:26.355 --> 21:29.080
Okay. Well, I'll let you,
um, get back to it.

21:29.105 --> 21:30.570
- Thanks, Paul.
- <i>Okay, listen.</i>

21:30.595 --> 21:32.440
Enjoy yourself, okay?

21:32.464 --> 21:34.240
It's all good, really.

21:34.265 --> 21:35.965
Okay. Thanks.

21:52.067 --> 21:54.153
You came.

21:55.408 --> 21:56.697
I came.

21:56.721 --> 21:59.767
Ah, Zoey, Simon loved
the slideshow so much,

21:59.791 --> 22:01.268
every picture. Right, babe?

22:01.292 --> 22:03.267
- It was amazing.
- Oh, shoot.

22:03.292 --> 22:05.960
Sorry. I need to go and chat
with the caterer. Excuse me.

22:08.814 --> 22:10.213
Hi.

22:10.725 --> 22:12.922
I-I hope it's okay that I'm here.

22:12.947 --> 22:15.415
It's a long story.
Basically Joan forced me.

22:15.440 --> 22:17.228
I might also be drunk.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.768
Of course it's okay.
I'm glad you're here.

22:18.792 --> 22:22.603
I'd like to think we get
to stay friends, right?

22:22.946 --> 22:25.416
Right. Friends.

22:25.441 --> 22:26.752
Definitely.

22:26.777 --> 22:28.408
So, enjoy your...

22:28.813 --> 22:30.775
night, you big party man.

22:31.103 --> 22:33.431
Well, thanks, Zoey, for everything.

23:09.394 --> 23:10.713
Oh, my God, are you okay?

23:10.738 --> 23:13.306
No. I'm not.

23:13.331 --> 23:16.110
I'm a mess and emotional.

23:16.134 --> 23:18.430
- Also, vodka.
- Oh.

23:18.455 --> 23:20.636
Wh-what happened?

23:26.281 --> 23:28.947
Simon showed up at my
apartment late last night.

23:28.972 --> 23:30.416
- Oh.
- But before you say anything,

23:30.441 --> 23:32.191
I know it sounds bad,
but nothing happened.

23:32.216 --> 23:34.828
He just wanted some grief advice,
and then he left.

23:34.852 --> 23:37.698
But honestly, it got close,

23:37.722 --> 23:42.024
and I have real feelings... for him.

23:42.049 --> 23:45.339
And I know you warned me about
getting too close to him.

23:45.363 --> 23:49.250
I tried to back away,
but it didn't happen and...

23:51.009 --> 23:53.516
now here I am at this
beautiful engagement party

23:53.541 --> 23:56.150
acting like a total idiot.

23:56.174 --> 23:57.580
Oh, my God.

23:58.673 --> 24:02.471
I'm so sorry that you've gotten
yourself into this situation,

24:02.496 --> 24:05.024
because I can see
how much you're hurting,

24:05.049 --> 24:09.713
but you, my daughter, are not an idiot.

24:10.275 --> 24:14.984
It's just, life doesn't
always go as planned.

24:15.009 --> 24:17.274
It just doesn't.

24:17.674 --> 24:21.242
And that's a lesson that we're
both learning all too well.

24:23.327 --> 24:25.594
Hey, come here.

24:26.036 --> 24:27.614
So sorry.

24:27.639 --> 24:29.297
Do you think I'm a bad person?

24:29.322 --> 24:31.000
No.

24:31.798 --> 24:35.165
Hey, let's go take
a picture for your dad.

24:35.384 --> 24:37.759
- Let's get out of here.
- Okay.

24:46.678 --> 24:47.678
Thank you.

24:47.712 --> 24:49.155
This really is beautiful, Mom.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.150
I'm glad I got to see it in person,

24:51.682 --> 24:53.227
but I am very ready to go home.

24:53.251 --> 24:55.109
Oh, me, too. Can I give you a ride?

24:55.134 --> 24:57.742
Uh, no, that's okay. You go.

24:57.767 --> 25:01.181
I should check on Joan before
she becomes an HR situation.

25:01.384 --> 25:02.683
Okay.

25:03.467 --> 25:05.279
- Bye.
- Bye.

25:08.024 --> 25:09.243
Then the next thing I know,

25:09.267 --> 25:13.269
the sun is starting to rise,
and that's when we realize...

25:13.294 --> 25:15.197
I think you should bid a hundr...

25:15.221 --> 25:18.165
And that's when we realized
that we were all naked.

25:20.362 --> 25:22.061
I'm gonna call.

25:29.001 --> 25:30.798
God, Mitch.

25:33.927 --> 25:39.142
I have just done so many
stupid things over the years.

25:39.534 --> 25:42.306
All the drugs, the booze, the women.

25:44.658 --> 25:48.260
I can't even remember the
last time I saw a doctor.

25:50.115 --> 25:52.095
I just always assumed that...

25:53.883 --> 25:57.345
I always assumed that I would
be the first one of us to go,

25:58.361 --> 26:00.351
and I just never thought...

26:10.995 --> 26:12.261
I never thought...

26:22.940 --> 26:25.390
Anyway, it's past 10:00,

26:25.415 --> 26:27.845
so the boss said that
means it's bedtime,

26:27.870 --> 26:30.771
so let's get you upstairs.

26:38.589 --> 26:40.666
Zoey, look. I did it with my tongue.

26:40.691 --> 26:42.302
Great work, Joan.

26:42.326 --> 26:44.004
You okay if I go?

26:44.028 --> 26:45.423
Lame, but go.

26:45.448 --> 26:46.532
- Bye.
- Bye.

26:46.557 --> 26:47.890
Zo White, a word.

26:47.915 --> 26:50.093
Mo, hi. Um, can we talk later?

26:50.118 --> 26:52.312
- I really need to...
- Oh, no, no, don't care.

26:52.336 --> 26:55.312
Quick question.
Who is that hot guy talking to Jessica?

26:55.337 --> 26:56.939
He and I almost had a moment earlier.

26:56.964 --> 26:59.687
I don't know him. I think he's
part of Jessica's "I Do Crew."

26:59.712 --> 27:02.011
Is that really what she's
calling her bridal party?

27:03.145 --> 27:05.023
Earlier I saw them wearing jackets

27:05.048 --> 27:08.025
that said, "Say Yes To The Jess."

27:08.486 --> 27:10.515
Is it weird that I want one of those?

27:10.540 --> 27:12.821
Okay, I'm leaving now for real.

27:17.970 --> 27:21.363
Can everyone please join
Jessica and I in the backyard?

27:26.161 --> 27:28.695
Oh, oh, oh, oh. Come, come, come, come.

27:33.392 --> 27:35.421
Hello, everybody. Please gather around.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.392
I have some words I'd like to say.

27:37.417 --> 27:41.260
Can we please give it up for
our party-planning visionary,

27:41.285 --> 27:44.154
the gorgeous love of my life,
Jessica Hamilton?

27:48.759 --> 27:50.436
You all know that my family and I

27:50.461 --> 27:53.507
have lived in some real
darkness this past year,

27:53.531 --> 27:56.276
but through it all,
Jessica has been my rock,

27:56.587 --> 27:58.689
the lighthouse in my storm.

27:59.937 --> 28:01.281
Now, I already know that there aren't

28:01.305 --> 28:02.549
enough words in the English language

28:02.573 --> 28:04.523
for me to properly
express my love for her,

28:04.548 --> 28:07.150
but I'm gonna try to do it anyway.

28:08.379 --> 28:10.915

- To Jessica!

29:50.347 --> 29:52.056
I got a big problem.

29:56.644 --> 30:00.343
She was singing "Say My Name"
over and over.

30:00.368 --> 30:03.226
Yeah, nothing good happens
after someone sings that song.

30:03.251 --> 30:06.016
But I don't understand
why she's so upset.

30:06.041 --> 30:08.103
I talked to her, like, 20 minutes ago.

30:08.587 --> 30:10.712
What changed all of a sudden?

30:10.737 --> 30:12.489
Does it matter? If she's singing it,

30:12.514 --> 30:14.392
she's feeling it. Isn't that the rule?

30:14.416 --> 30:17.184
Yes. You're right.

30:19.520 --> 30:22.232
And another rule is that
now I have to deal with it.

30:22.257 --> 30:23.548
Exactly.

30:24.001 --> 30:26.003
Wait. You don't mean now, do you?

30:26.403 --> 30:27.702
Yes.

30:33.030 --> 30:35.608
Yes, I am the boss, but it doesn't mean

30:35.633 --> 30:39.157
that I can't cut loose,
because I am loose, Leif... Paper.

30:39.533 --> 30:40.784
I might be drunk.

30:40.809 --> 30:42.354
- Fun.
- Hi, Joan.

30:42.814 --> 30:43.854
Hi.

30:43.879 --> 30:45.690
Who is that? Do I know her?

30:45.714 --> 30:47.907
Did I fire her? Do we
work together? God.

30:47.932 --> 30:49.259
It's Karen from Accounting.

30:49.284 --> 30:52.363
Oh, hey, Kar... Karen, great accounting.

30:52.388 --> 30:55.066
I hate when people assume
that I know their names.

30:55.090 --> 30:56.564
I'm very successful and busy.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.846
I meet a new person every single day.

30:59.728 --> 31:03.301
But I do have trouble remembering
names in social situations.

31:03.326 --> 31:05.256
We should make a device for that.

31:05.281 --> 31:06.787
What do you mean?

31:09.290 --> 31:12.049
Um, yeah, like a...
a piece of, like, wearable tech

31:12.074 --> 31:15.474
that uses a pin-size camera and
facial-recognition software.

31:15.499 --> 31:16.720
Can you do that?

31:16.745 --> 31:18.490
Could you hook it up to social media?

31:18.857 --> 31:20.959
Yeah, and bounce the relevant data

31:20.983 --> 31:23.248
back to the user through an earpiece.

31:23.273 --> 31:24.995
What? Whoa.

31:25.020 --> 31:26.664
I love this idea. Do you love it?

31:26.688 --> 31:28.709
- Y-Yeah.
- Let's do it.

31:29.201 --> 31:31.436
Let's... Let's do it. Um...

31:31.461 --> 31:34.238
We gotta get on this, like, s...

31:34.263 --> 31:36.608
Yesterday. Tomorrow?

31:36.632 --> 31:38.568
- Soon.
- Totally.

31:38.911 --> 31:40.822
Are you sure you wanna do this?

31:40.847 --> 31:42.029
Mm-hmm.

31:42.684 --> 31:44.100
Hey, Z.

31:44.428 --> 31:46.840
Mo, you would be very proud of me.

31:46.865 --> 31:49.987
- Where you been?
- Oh, just crushing the party game.

31:50.012 --> 31:51.523
Getting lots of attention.

31:51.547 --> 31:54.204
You were right.
The clothes really do make the man.

31:54.998 --> 31:57.594
Oh, and how's it going
with our friend over there?

31:57.619 --> 31:58.767
He's clearly not into me,

31:58.792 --> 32:00.306
otherwise he would have spoken to me.

32:00.331 --> 32:01.735
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.934
Whatever happened
to all that Mo swagger?

32:03.959 --> 32:05.493
It went on a Mo-cation.

32:06.303 --> 32:07.603
You know what?

32:07.628 --> 32:09.632
- We're doing this.
- We're doing what? No.

32:09.657 --> 32:12.321
Zoey, rules are meant to be broken.

32:14.837 --> 32:17.157
Hi, there. Uh, I'm Max,

32:17.182 --> 32:20.446
and this is the one, the only...

32:20.470 --> 32:21.819
Drumroll, please...

32:21.844 --> 32:24.889
Mo. I'm sorry. My friend is not well.

32:25.374 --> 32:26.791
I'm Eddie.

32:27.407 --> 32:29.160
Eddie, can I tell you a secret?

32:29.184 --> 32:31.863
Not only did Mo design
this entire killer outfit,

32:31.887 --> 32:34.332
but also tailored my suit to perfection.

32:34.356 --> 32:36.301
So you're attractive and talented?

32:37.056 --> 32:38.946
There are so few of us.

32:39.557 --> 32:41.658
I think I'm gonna get one mo' drink.

32:52.164 --> 32:53.726
Hi, Jessica.

32:53.751 --> 32:55.390
I'm just saying hello.

32:55.415 --> 32:57.373
Are you having a good party?

32:57.398 --> 32:59.055
- Can't say that I am, Zoey.
- Mm-hmm.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.924
I heard you talking to your mum earlier.

33:00.949 --> 33:03.648
Seems I'm not the only person
who's close with my fiancé.

33:03.673 --> 33:06.363
- Right. Um...
- I can't believe I was so blind

33:06.388 --> 33:08.711
about what's actually happening
between you and Simon.

33:08.736 --> 33:10.765
- Babe? What's going on?
- Oh, not much.

33:10.790 --> 33:12.671
Just chatting about you
being at Zoey's apartment

33:12.695 --> 33:13.872
after I went to bed last night.

33:13.896 --> 33:15.007
- It's not...
- Can we just not...

33:15.031 --> 33:16.330
I don't want to hear it.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.945
I'll talk with you later.

33:19.706 --> 33:21.238
Get out of my house.

33:22.729 --> 33:25.536
And stay the hell away from my fiancé.

33:41.837 --> 33:44.037
I think I like it better this way.

33:52.336 --> 33:54.024
I can't believe that
happened and how quickly.

33:54.048 --> 33:55.734
Just forget about the rose wall...

33:56.080 --> 33:57.634
that your mother
and I worked tirelessly on

33:57.658 --> 33:58.931
and was the whole reason that I wanted

33:58.955 --> 34:00.930
to have this party
outside in the first place.

34:02.803 --> 34:04.825
All I want to know is if you
two are sleeping together.

34:04.849 --> 34:06.327
- No!
- Jessica, can we go inside

34:06.351 --> 34:07.695
- and talk about this later?
- I'm just gonna...

34:07.719 --> 34:09.274
- This feels like a conversation...
- No, no.

34:09.297 --> 34:11.043
If there's something going on,
I'd love all our friends

34:11.067 --> 34:12.984
- to hear about it.
- Nothing is going on.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.835
Jess, I was just really upset
about my dad last night...

34:14.859 --> 34:16.603
It's always about your dad.

34:16.846 --> 34:18.312
I'm... I...

34:19.375 --> 34:22.170
I hate that you're hurting, Simon,

34:22.195 --> 34:24.429
but I feel like you're using
your grief as an excuse

34:24.455 --> 34:27.312
- to not address the fact that...
- That's... not fair.

34:27.871 --> 34:29.583
I needed to talk to someone.

34:29.609 --> 34:31.051
You told me to go talk to someone.

34:31.076 --> 34:33.562
I meant a therapist, not an arsonist.

34:34.469 --> 34:37.525
I can't believe you would
rather talk to her than me,

34:37.549 --> 34:39.560
the "love of your life," right?

34:39.812 --> 34:41.023
I'm sorry.

34:41.047 --> 34:42.395
This is...

34:42.420 --> 34:43.719
over.

34:44.355 --> 34:45.366
All of it.

34:50.947 --> 34:53.635
It says there's no cars... available.

34:53.659 --> 34:54.670
How's that even possible?

34:54.695 --> 34:56.661
Well, I think
the Warriors game just ended.

34:56.687 --> 34:58.766
You wanna walk? I mean,
I could grab us a couple scooters.

34:58.790 --> 35:01.437
- I don't know what I want.
- Well, that's okay.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.048
But you should probably leave this party

35:04.072 --> 35:06.006
before you burn something else down.

35:08.112 --> 35:10.157
That's almost funny.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.478
Sorry.

35:13.951 --> 35:15.395
Hey, Mom, is everything okay?

35:15.420 --> 35:16.805
Zoey, your father fell

35:16.830 --> 35:19.605
when, uh, Paul was
helping him up the stairs.

35:19.630 --> 35:20.807
Is he all right?

35:20.832 --> 35:23.036
Um, I-I think so. I don't know.

35:23.061 --> 35:24.599
I think he might be in pain.

35:24.624 --> 35:26.905
<i>Just meet us at Saint Francis Hospital.</i>

35:26.930 --> 35:28.508
Of course. I'll be right there.

35:28.533 --> 35:30.935
Uh, is everything okay? Is it your dad?

35:30.960 --> 35:33.346
Yeah, yeah, yeah. He fell, but, um...

35:34.779 --> 35:35.950
Why isn't this working?

35:35.974 --> 35:38.586
How are there no drivers anywhere? I...

35:39.298 --> 35:41.150
I need to get to the hospital right now.

35:41.175 --> 35:42.418
Okay, okay, okay.

35:42.443 --> 35:44.596
Zoey, I'm gonna get you there.

35:44.621 --> 35:46.029
All right?

35:46.618 --> 35:47.795
I promise.

36:53.737 --> 36:55.294
I don't see your name on it.

36:55.319 --> 36:56.997
Buddy, you're gonna put
that scooter down

36:57.021 --> 36:58.866
and walk away right now,
because I need that thing

36:58.890 --> 37:01.193
more than you've ever needed
anything in your entire life,

37:01.218 --> 37:03.670
and I'm ready to fight
you for it if you make me.

37:03.695 --> 37:05.318
So what are you gonna do?

37:08.459 --> 37:09.724
Zoey, it's all yours.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.145
Max, I wouldn't trust myself
to ride that thing sober,

37:12.170 --> 37:14.014
let alone now, still halfway drunk.

37:14.038 --> 37:16.472
All right.
Well, then we'll ride it together.

37:22.074 --> 37:24.123
Hold on tight, okay?

37:35.560 --> 37:36.818
I know I messed up.

37:36.843 --> 37:39.138
Simon, the last thing
I want to hear from you

37:39.163 --> 37:40.463
is another apology.

37:42.365 --> 37:44.139
- I love you.
- Yeah.

37:47.801 --> 37:49.300
I love you, too.

37:50.908 --> 37:52.342
But I just...

37:52.710 --> 37:55.224
I really need to be mad
at you right now, so...

37:55.249 --> 37:56.873
I'm going to bed.

37:57.355 --> 37:59.060
You can clean up.

38:08.593 --> 38:11.615
Hey, thank you so much for
bringing the bed downstairs.

38:11.640 --> 38:13.135
Yeah. Of course.

38:15.780 --> 38:18.381
Oh, sweetheart, your poor back.

38:20.618 --> 38:23.599
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

38:24.248 --> 38:25.817
I never should have left.

38:25.842 --> 38:27.588
It's not your fault.

38:27.612 --> 38:29.623
The ER doctor said she's surprised

38:29.647 --> 38:30.935
that this hasn't happened sooner

38:30.960 --> 38:33.030
with us taking him up and
down the stairs all the time.

38:33.054 --> 38:35.294
I left him alone, and for what?

38:35.319 --> 38:38.645
To... To go to a party?

38:38.670 --> 38:41.342
Mom, it was an accident, okay?

38:41.788 --> 38:44.676
Paul is a big, strong guy.

38:44.701 --> 38:45.703
- Yeah.
- They just slipped.

38:45.727 --> 38:48.275
And Paul, he couldn't stop
beating himself up.

38:48.300 --> 38:50.700
Okay, so then don't do the same thing.

38:51.739 --> 38:53.842
It could have been so much worse.

38:55.973 --> 38:57.439
I'm just...

38:58.677 --> 39:02.349
not ready to lose you.

39:03.124 --> 39:04.668
I'm not.

39:05.099 --> 39:07.177
You hear me?

39:08.029 --> 39:11.569
Y-You have to stick with us.

39:14.859 --> 39:16.792
I'm gonna leave you two alone.

39:18.329 --> 39:20.563
I love you.

39:21.716 --> 39:23.449
It's been a long night.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.087
Max, thank you.

39:35.232 --> 39:36.657
No, really, thank you.

39:36.681 --> 39:38.694
You were there for me tonight
when I least expected it,

39:38.718 --> 39:41.779
and I... appreciate you.

39:44.495 --> 39:46.445
Well, I'm here if you need me.

39:49.728 --> 39:51.148
Always.

39:53.440 --> 39:54.953
