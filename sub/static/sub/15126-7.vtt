00:17.560 --> 00:21.039
Daniel. Theodore. You must be tired.

00:21.077 --> 00:23.736
I have rooms prepared...
No rest, Daniel.

00:23.763 --> 00:26.363
The journey from New York
is more comfortable now.

00:26.364 --> 00:29.003
I have made certain of it. Oh.

00:30.563 --> 00:34.882
Oh, er, my associate, Mr Goodnight.

00:34.883 --> 00:36.803
Mr Goodnight. Sir.

00:39.563 --> 00:41.322
Shall we?

00:41.323 --> 00:44.323
Oh! Keys, Charlie.

00:50.243 --> 00:55.043
Do you feel that you require
protection in our city, Theodore?

00:56.403 --> 00:58.443
I require it in life.

01:00.683 --> 01:02.323
Lead on, Daniel.

01:12.563 --> 01:13.963
Boys.

01:17.563 --> 01:20.923
The next matter to which we attend.

01:23.243 --> 01:26.723
We find her, there he will be also.

01:38.643 --> 01:40.282
Shelby. Sir. Mary.

01:40.283 --> 01:41.323
Captain Jackson.

01:44.083 --> 01:46.803
Afternoon. Afternoon, sir.

01:55.123 --> 01:57.523
Comfortable? And what if I am?

02:54.403 --> 02:56.403
He's stiff in mortis.
Which means?

02:57.523 --> 03:01.642
Hobbs? No less than 12 hours
since he breathed his last,

03:01.643 --> 03:03.963
but no more than three days, sir.

03:05.563 --> 03:09.122
Stevedore, pissed on porter,
falls in, drowns.

03:09.123 --> 03:12.603
No, his jacket's too decent
for that. Shirt and trousers, though.

03:12.604 --> 03:13.802
There's this.

03:13.803 --> 03:15.322
Burns.

03:15.323 --> 03:18.121
Bad. But too precise
to be fire or water.

03:18.122 --> 03:21.721
From a steampipe, perhaps?
Could he be some type of engineer?

03:21.722 --> 03:23.803
His good coat on over
his work clothes?

03:23.804 --> 03:25.202
The lad improves.

03:25.203 --> 03:26.601
He is drowned, however.

03:26.602 --> 03:28.643
Well, you do have
that right, Sergeant.

03:28.644 --> 03:33.402
Drowned, drunk and murdered. Algae
in his lungs, gin in his belly.

03:33.403 --> 03:36.323
And you have this.
Hobbs, give me a hand. Sorry.

03:41.683 --> 03:43.363
His spinal cord is cut.

03:45.243 --> 03:47.202
One stroke of a thin blade.

03:47.203 --> 03:48.722
He was paralysed?

03:48.723 --> 03:51.322
Mm-hmm. Then put in the water.

03:51.323 --> 03:56.723
He would have kicked for sure
but found himself capable of
nothing more than sinking.

03:56.724 --> 03:58.883
Cruel. Professional also. Hm.

04:00.003 --> 04:02.083
It was the West India
Docks he was found?

04:02.084 --> 04:03.522
Yes, sir.

04:03.523 --> 04:06.281
Then did he come in on the tide
from the foundry at Bow Creek?

04:06.282 --> 04:08.603
Constable, get on the
wires to the caretaker there.

04:08.604 --> 04:11.683
See if an engineer's
reported missing. Sir.

04:30.243 --> 04:32.402
Gentlemen. Identify yourselves.

04:32.403 --> 04:35.322
Police. H Division.
Return the favour.

04:35.323 --> 04:37.642
I'm Bruton. Fields, my secretary.

04:37.643 --> 04:39.521
Neither of you the proprietor?

04:39.522 --> 04:41.441
I pay both Fanthorpe's
rent and wage.

04:41.442 --> 04:43.161
In what capacity is he paid?

04:43.162 --> 04:46.483
As chief engineer
to my shipping line. Which is?

04:46.484 --> 04:49.282
The Argentine Marine Company.

04:49.283 --> 04:52.123
Your engineer, er, Fanthorpe.
He was a big man.

04:52.124 --> 04:55.002
Around 15 stones,
two yards in height?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.802
You have him?

04:56.803 --> 05:00.081
Cut and quartered in our
dead room, I'm afraid. He's dead?!

05:00.082 --> 05:03.003
He was found caught in a sluice
over West India Docks.

05:03.004 --> 05:05.042
What? Drowned?

05:05.043 --> 05:07.163
What was it Mr Fanthorpe
made for you?

05:08.443 --> 05:10.843
The means by which
we might save our souls.

05:13.683 --> 05:16.201
You and your wife are
bound for the Americas.

05:16.202 --> 05:18.603
Which line do you trust
to carry you there?

05:20.123 --> 05:24.442
For comfort, White Star.
Swift Intercontinental for speed.

05:24.443 --> 05:26.841
20 years ago,
it would not have been so.

05:26.842 --> 05:30.521
You'd have booked passage
on an Argentine steamer and
not thought twice about it.

05:30.522 --> 05:33.123
Samuel Fanthorpe was to
return us to those glories.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.042
I'm bound to ask how.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.961
Am I to simply hand you and your
man my most prized confidence?

05:37.962 --> 05:42.003
Mr Bruton, it was not simple
misadventure that put
Mr Fanthorpe in the Thames.

05:42.004 --> 05:44.283
It was murder. Murder?!

05:49.003 --> 05:56.002
It is an engine. Triple expansion.
To drive a triple screw propeller.

05:56.003 --> 05:58.881
That type of power inside us
and the journey time to New York,

05:58.882 --> 06:01.681
Buenos Aries, Cape Town
would have been reduced by days

06:01.682 --> 06:05.083
and our competitors nothing more
than a sail on the horizon.

06:05.084 --> 06:06.522
Mrs Fanthorpe!

06:06.523 --> 06:09.003
Martha. What?

06:16.843 --> 06:19.561
Would you allow us
a moment, Mr Bruton?

06:19.562 --> 06:22.363
Martha, would you have me...?
No, Ezekiel Bruton, I would not.

06:32.763 --> 06:36.362
What was it brought you
to his place of work today?

06:36.363 --> 06:38.801
His absence from
his place of living.

06:38.802 --> 06:40.563
And when did you see him last?

06:40.564 --> 06:42.202
Three days ago.

06:42.203 --> 06:44.601
That is some time for a
husband not to see his wife.

06:44.602 --> 06:46.523
Not this husband. Nor this wife.

06:46.524 --> 06:49.522
Excuse me, ma'am?
You're married, Mr Reid?

06:49.523 --> 06:53.642
I am. And your marriage is
a picture of permanent joy?

06:53.643 --> 06:55.643
No, I, er...

06:59.043 --> 07:03.482
Mr Bruton there, he told me
a little of the engine

07:03.483 --> 07:05.481
your husband was designing for him

07:05.482 --> 07:09.843
and its significance to AMC's future.
He had finished the design?

07:09.844 --> 07:13.443
He had not. It neared
completion, however.

07:15.883 --> 07:19.443
This engine, it was our last hope.

07:21.723 --> 07:24.562
But our lines to South America,

07:24.563 --> 07:28.441
the steel that sails them,
they are not without some value.

07:28.442 --> 07:31.361
And now I must present
them to our predators.

07:31.362 --> 07:34.041
And one such has made itself
known to your shareholders?

07:34.042 --> 07:36.921
There is an offer, yes. And you are
dutybound to hear their vote

07:36.922 --> 07:40.841
on whether to accept or no.
Hear and obey. We sit in two days.

07:40.842 --> 07:43.881
Then you understand why I must ask
who makes this offer as this

07:43.882 --> 07:45.403
may be a motive for murder?

07:46.803 --> 07:50.043
The name of his company tripped
easily from your tongue.

07:51.283 --> 07:53.803
Swift Intercontinental.

07:55.523 --> 07:58.121
Theodore Swift himself
with his Pinkerton entourage

07:58.122 --> 08:00.923
arrived from New York
to see the deal closed.

08:00.924 --> 08:02.803
Your work travels, Mr Best.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.123
Picked that up in New York.

08:13.163 --> 08:14.442
You are American.

08:14.443 --> 08:16.923
You know others similar?
What, in London this year?

08:18.923 --> 08:22.523
As many as there are pigeons
shitting in Grosvenor Square.

08:22.524 --> 08:24.402
Ha!

08:24.403 --> 08:30.482
There's a, er, there's
a man goes about with her.

08:30.483 --> 08:32.121
First I've seen of him.

08:32.123 --> 08:36.482
And she, Miss, er, Hart.
You call her a businesswoman?

08:36.482 --> 08:38.522
Turn of phrase. Meaning?

08:38.523 --> 08:41.361
What it commonly does.
She runs whores.

08:41.363 --> 08:42.403
Oh!

08:45.363 --> 08:48.163
From an address? Indeed. Which?

08:50.683 --> 08:52.362
I know not.

08:52.363 --> 08:53.763
Oh.

08:56.363 --> 09:00.562
I want to thank you
for your time, Mr Best.

09:00.563 --> 09:02.083
You're very welcome.

09:07.283 --> 09:09.722
You lie.

09:09.723 --> 09:11.163
She was shook down.

09:12.843 --> 09:15.963
The police tolerate such business
but when it rose into plain view,

09:15.964 --> 09:18.722
she was moved on. To where?

09:18.723 --> 09:20.762
I know... I know not.

09:20.763 --> 09:25.282
Which is your constant refrain,
Mr Best. A reporter so ignorant.

09:25.283 --> 09:28.403
Back home, you'd be sweeping
pencil shavings for pigfeed.

09:30.883 --> 09:33.163
No, no. No, please.

09:43.163 --> 09:46.843
I find you lie to me,
I'm coming for your face.

09:57.843 --> 10:03.123
So, gentlemen. Mr Bruton,
Mr Fields, Mrs Fanthorpe.

10:05.003 --> 10:07.842
Please, don't any
of you leave London.

10:07.843 --> 10:10.683
It is not I that will be
leaving London, Reid.

10:10.684 --> 10:12.442
It is my business.

10:12.443 --> 10:14.083
Shall we?

10:27.283 --> 10:29.002
Constable.

10:29.003 --> 10:33.761
There is something of a chill about
Mrs Fanthorpe which strikes strange.

10:33.762 --> 10:36.681
Get yourself into civvies
and keep a watch over her.

10:36.682 --> 10:41.083
Find out if away from our eyes
she chooses to mourn any heavier.

10:41.084 --> 10:45.283
Yes, sir. Th-th-thank you, sir. Hm.

10:48.243 --> 10:49.963
Artherton, we have the week's papers?

10:49.964 --> 10:51.003
We do, sir.

10:57.603 --> 11:00.962
Ah. Here.

11:00.963 --> 11:04.121
"Swift Intercontinental's Mr TP Swift
and his banker,

11:04.122 --> 11:07.801
"Mr Daniel Goldman, both of whom
declined to deny or confirm

11:07.802 --> 11:10.561
"that the shipping magnate's
visit from New York

11:10.562 --> 11:13.801
"had any bearing on the emergency
stockholder meeting

11:13.802 --> 11:17.163
"called by the ailing
transatlantic Argentine Marine."

11:18.483 --> 11:21.882
Oh, Jackson, New York
ship owner, name of Swift.

11:21.883 --> 11:23.283
That mean anything to you?

11:27.403 --> 11:29.043
Your reason for asking?

11:36.043 --> 11:40.003
My apologies, Reid.
I must disappoint for once.

11:53.243 --> 11:54.883
Excuse me, gentlemen.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.803
Have you found her?

12:02.203 --> 12:05.082
It was never going to be easy. Easy?

12:05.083 --> 12:08.843
Frank, I don't pay you because you
know how to get easy things done.

12:08.844 --> 12:11.523
No, Mr Swift.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.243
Susan!

12:19.443 --> 12:23.123
Let's see if you can guess
who's visiting on business?

12:23.124 --> 12:26.482
Good evening to you,
Captain Jackson.

12:26.483 --> 12:27.563
Best.

12:30.643 --> 12:32.203
What the hell's going on here?

12:32.204 --> 12:36.402
One of your countrymen had cause
to separate my ear from me.

12:36.403 --> 12:39.523
A Pinkerton named Goodnight.

12:42.483 --> 12:44.643
You do what you can to fix my head.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.963
And I shall tell you all
we spoke of, he and I.

12:54.803 --> 12:58.562
After all, what is a Pinkerton

12:58.563 --> 13:02.241
but a hired lawman who lives
on another continent entirely?

13:02.242 --> 13:03.603
He holds no sway here.

13:05.803 --> 13:07.523
So why should I hand you to him?

13:10.923 --> 13:16.522
You, Captain Jackson, whose value
to me is almost beyond compare.

13:16.523 --> 13:18.922
I fail to see how, Mr Best.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.841
Well, it pertains to our
mutual friend, Mr Reid,

13:21.842 --> 13:24.443
and the steadfast alliance
he makes with you.

13:25.643 --> 13:29.763
A kinship so close that
his reputation cannot help
but be advanced by it.

13:32.043 --> 13:34.562
Well, advanced, or blackened,

13:34.563 --> 13:39.522
depending on the truth of
your own life, Captain.

13:39.523 --> 13:41.041
Your story is all I ask,

13:41.042 --> 13:43.521
how the two of you are
bound to this American,

13:43.522 --> 13:47.121
something that, now I have suffered
for affording you my protection,

13:47.122 --> 13:48.723
I would have you share with me.

13:52.083 --> 13:57.842
So, now I give you both the
opportunity to unburden yourselves,

13:57.843 --> 14:01.002
will you do so?

14:01.003 --> 14:04.683
Or must I reconsider
my approach to Mr Goodnight?

14:05.843 --> 14:08.761
We would like nothing more
than to help you, Mr Best.

14:08.762 --> 14:12.161
But sadly I have not one
inkling as to what you refer.

14:12.162 --> 14:14.761
If you want to go reacquaint
yourself with this Pinkerton

14:14.762 --> 14:17.363
and his knife, I'm afraid
we cannot stop you.

14:20.323 --> 14:21.883
As you prefer.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.603
Madam.

14:31.603 --> 14:34.443
Those sons of bitches.
They cannot do this.

14:34.444 --> 14:36.082
I will not allow it.

14:36.083 --> 14:39.081
Fine. Why don't you just
march on down there and tell
them all to go to hell?

14:39.082 --> 14:42.363
Oh, you quip, but I'm in earnest...
Sit down, will you?

14:45.363 --> 14:46.883
You let me do the marching.

14:48.763 --> 14:50.601
This man once called me a friend.

14:50.602 --> 14:53.161
And then amongst others
you killed his brother.

14:53.162 --> 14:57.843
Well, he was never one to hold a
grudge. I'll ask him what he wants.

14:59.123 --> 15:01.481
And what if the
answer is to kill you?

15:01.482 --> 15:03.003
Then at least we'll know.

15:09.643 --> 15:13.683
Mr Fields, a face like that
will solve precisely nothing.

15:15.243 --> 15:17.362
I apologise, Mr Bruton.

15:17.363 --> 15:21.082
However, I fear for us,
our survival.

15:21.083 --> 15:24.041
My life savings are bound up
in our company's stock.

15:24.042 --> 15:27.803
And now, without Samuel's engine,
I shall lose everything.

15:27.804 --> 15:31.442
I'm going to tell you
a thing, a secret thing.

15:31.443 --> 15:33.961
Only two men have ever
shared its knowledge,

15:33.962 --> 15:35.683
and one of these now lies dead.

15:37.003 --> 15:40.003
It pertains to
Martha, Mrs Fanthorpe...

16:04.363 --> 16:05.643
Gentlemen.

16:22.483 --> 16:26.242
Men sank a cable in the sea,
here to Nova Scotia.

16:26.243 --> 16:28.763
News arrives from
America in instants.

16:28.764 --> 16:32.202
And what do they say,
these Americans?

16:32.203 --> 16:34.563
These are coded
stock transactions.

16:34.564 --> 16:40.562
Those from the floor of the Chicago
Stock Exchange. You are Reid?

16:40.563 --> 16:42.761
I am, sir. This is Drake,
my sergeant.

16:42.762 --> 16:45.483
And your business here?
Urgent, I understand?

16:45.484 --> 16:47.442
With Mr Swift.

16:47.443 --> 16:48.722
You know my name?

16:48.723 --> 16:50.122
I do.

16:50.123 --> 16:53.523
Mr Swift is my guest
in our city, Inspector.

16:55.083 --> 16:56.963
Would you have me leave him to you?

16:56.964 --> 16:58.442
That is his choice.

16:58.443 --> 17:01.602
I have nothing to hide.
Name your query.

17:01.603 --> 17:06.083
Accusations made against you.
Of what? Conspiracy to murder.

17:07.443 --> 17:10.521
This is an outrage! Nonetheless,
it is true. A man is killed.

17:10.521 --> 17:13.560
An engineer, name of Fanthorpe,
contracted to Argentine Marine.

17:13.561 --> 17:16.840
And no doubt it is young
Mr Bruton lodges the claim.

17:16.842 --> 17:19.881
You have men travelling
with you, I understand.

17:19.882 --> 17:23.241
I have. I would be grateful if you
would confirm your whereabouts

17:23.242 --> 17:25.963
day and night across the
21st and 22nd of this month.

17:25.964 --> 17:28.962
Yours and your men. You can do that?

17:28.963 --> 17:32.283
Gladly. If you'll
follow us, gentlemen.

17:41.443 --> 17:47.323
My er, associate, Mr Goodnight
of the Pinkerton Agency.

17:50.203 --> 17:54.763
Frank, show these lawmen
our transit papers, will you?

18:19.963 --> 18:21.682
As you can see, Mr Reid,

18:21.683 --> 18:26.242
we put in to Liverpool
late on the day you speak of.

18:26.243 --> 18:29.723
The night, we were
aboard the train south.

18:32.683 --> 18:37.642
Well, a relief to have
that squared away.

18:37.643 --> 18:40.962
Hmm, Inspector?

18:40.963 --> 18:45.162
And for our part, I'm sure we
all understand that you,

18:45.163 --> 18:46.883
you must perform your duties.

18:49.243 --> 18:51.323
My, er, my apologies, Mr Swift.

18:52.403 --> 18:53.923
Don't mention it.

18:57.043 --> 18:58.243
Hey, Reid.

19:00.643 --> 19:03.883
You're the Jake brought
that slumlord to ground

19:03.884 --> 19:07.562
a few months back, right?
Read about you in the news.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.283
Way the hacker had it in the story,
it was a woman brought him to you.

19:11.284 --> 19:15.483
Never stated such, but the sense
was she kept a cathouse.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.722
And so?

19:18.723 --> 19:23.442
It, er, trouble you to
tell me which and where?

19:23.443 --> 19:28.442
No. No trouble at all, if I had
the knowledge. We moved her on.

19:28.443 --> 19:31.763
Any notion of where
she might have relocated? Um...

19:34.403 --> 19:38.363
None. You heard tell of Miss
Hart's whereabouts, Sergeant?

19:38.364 --> 19:40.842
No, sir. You see, Mr Goodnight?

19:40.843 --> 19:44.123
We'd gladly be of service to you
but we currently lack the means.

19:45.683 --> 19:46.723
Good day to you, sir.

19:49.243 --> 19:51.562
And so?

19:51.563 --> 19:55.482
These Limeys, they lie,
they don't lie. Who's to know?

19:55.483 --> 19:57.442
They're like altar boys.

19:57.443 --> 19:58.962
British police?

19:58.963 --> 20:01.681
Not the first likeness which
strikes round my way.

20:01.682 --> 20:03.481
I've wiped worse shit off my shoe.

20:03.482 --> 20:05.723
Well, you leave them be right now.

20:05.724 --> 20:09.042
This other matter,
there are developments.

20:09.043 --> 20:10.123
A change in the game.

20:11.723 --> 20:14.363
Have Charlie and the boys
keep on the search for her

20:14.364 --> 20:19.203
while you collect a package for me.

20:30.483 --> 20:32.363
Your American newspapers, sir.

20:33.643 --> 20:36.202
Is there something wrong, Mallinson?

20:36.203 --> 20:37.483
Off you go, then.

20:40.283 --> 20:43.243
Let us see if we can find you,
my Pinkerton friends.

20:47.963 --> 20:49.283
Afternoon, Frank.

20:54.323 --> 20:58.163
I'd wish you the same if I knew what
they were calling you these days.

21:10.283 --> 21:12.641
How you stand this place,
I do not know.

21:12.642 --> 21:16.681
Oh, you grow accustomed while
the charms reveal themselves.

21:16.682 --> 21:19.683
As I recall, it was only the
one charm brought you here.

21:19.684 --> 21:24.322
Nah, she moved on. Decided I wasn't
to her liking after all.

21:24.323 --> 21:27.323
You're awful breezy about
a woman that cost you so much.

21:27.324 --> 21:28.363
Others too.

21:29.483 --> 21:33.642
What passed that day, I never
meant it to go like that.

21:33.643 --> 21:35.522
I was sorry for them.

21:35.523 --> 21:37.123
I still mourn for William.

21:39.883 --> 21:43.523
Would it make any bones to say
they drew on me first? None.

21:44.883 --> 21:48.361
And when the time comes,
you'd best do the same to me.

21:48.362 --> 21:50.523
It wouldn't change
the upshot now, would it?

21:53.123 --> 21:55.203
I'm not as quick as you, Frank.

21:58.563 --> 22:00.243
Which is why you find me here.

22:01.963 --> 22:04.243
I came to see exactly
what it is brings you by.

22:06.083 --> 22:08.041
If there's a version of the future

22:08.042 --> 22:11.121
that includes you and
yours heading home happy,

22:11.122 --> 22:13.443
well, that is me
resting easy right here.

22:21.163 --> 22:24.483
We were friends once. Wouldn't
mean anything we were still.

22:27.043 --> 22:28.083
Was she worth it?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.041
I told you. She moved on.

22:32.042 --> 22:34.841
You forget I was by your side
the day you first saw her.

22:34.842 --> 22:38.841
You expect me to believe you'd lose
such a prize? I do. Well, I don't.

22:38.842 --> 22:41.523
Why is it no man in this
world will ever trust me?

22:42.803 --> 22:45.161
Maybe they see you for
what you really are.

22:45.162 --> 22:46.563
And what is that, Frank?

22:48.683 --> 22:53.203
A low, false, murdering,
sonofabitch cocksucker.

22:57.723 --> 23:00.283
Well, I didn't come
by here to be insulted.

23:00.284 --> 23:03.163
So, if you don't mind...

23:05.163 --> 23:06.683
I'll be heading on now.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.123
What? Here?

23:13.403 --> 23:16.321
From what I recall, your master
might baulk at such a rumpus

23:16.322 --> 23:18.361
so near his seat of operations.

23:18.362 --> 23:20.763
I know he would have
while I was on his ticket.

23:24.043 --> 23:28.962
Don't think I won't find you.
You and that stuck-up boxy!

23:28.963 --> 23:32.163
I have my way, you both will
die in this stinking shitpit!

23:54.843 --> 23:56.243
Goodnight, Goodnight...

23:57.683 --> 23:59.681
"William Goodnight and his men

23:59.682 --> 24:03.401
"killed in battle by the
Pinkerton traitor, Matthew Judge,

24:03.402 --> 24:07.921
"following his abduction for ransom
of the daughter of Theodore Swift.

24:07.922 --> 24:12.643
"His pursuers thus
over-powered, Judge vanished
into the Hoboken dockside."

24:15.203 --> 24:17.682
Matthew Judge?

24:17.683 --> 24:22.363
Every ruination my life has
ever known, your mark upon it!

24:24.563 --> 24:27.082
All of you! Back to your rooms.

24:27.083 --> 24:28.323
We're resting today.

24:30.843 --> 24:34.241
Anyhow, this is really
all down to you getting
your grill in the news.

24:34.242 --> 24:37.361
Oh, no, it is not! This is down
to you getting above your station

24:37.362 --> 24:39.801
and making eyes at me.
If we play by those rules,

24:39.802 --> 24:42.561
it's down to you getting
born in the first place.

24:42.562 --> 24:46.283
Besides, it weren't long before
you were making them right back.

24:49.163 --> 24:53.443
Anybody. Any man other than you
would have caused me less trouble.

24:54.483 --> 24:58.683
Any other woman and I'd still be
sat in The Roost playing cards

24:58.684 --> 25:00.642
with the Goodnight brothers.

25:00.643 --> 25:03.403
But you don't see me
bitching about it.

25:07.443 --> 25:10.923
You know, I know a thing
or two about the finding
of pleasure in this world.

25:10.924 --> 25:15.282
But I've got to tell you,
your endless ball-breaking aside,

25:15.283 --> 25:16.323
those few months...

25:19.003 --> 25:21.442
they hit the heights for me.

25:21.443 --> 25:24.841
You find me another man
still happy to say that to his wife

25:24.842 --> 25:28.243
three years after the fact.
You're going to listen to me.

25:33.763 --> 25:36.322
I'm going to leave you now.

25:36.323 --> 25:39.521
I'm going to run some errands,
collect a belonging of mine,

25:39.522 --> 25:44.441
and then I'm going to come back to
you. And then I'm going to do what
I've done countless times before.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.723
I'm going to leave
this town for another.

25:46.724 --> 25:49.442
If you wish to remain unmolested...

25:49.443 --> 25:51.323
come with me.

26:31.603 --> 26:35.202
I'd feel more comfortable
if you kept this on you.

26:35.203 --> 26:37.203
You never know
when you might need it.

26:42.883 --> 26:45.722
No word of Jackson, sir, nothing.

26:45.723 --> 26:48.683
Neville over The Bear says
he's not seen him all day.

26:48.684 --> 26:51.442
Then strange days
are upon us indeed.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.202
What is it, Mr Reid?

26:53.203 --> 26:57.762
Yesterday, before I sent Hobbs
out after Mrs Fanthorpe,

26:57.763 --> 27:01.202
I had him dispatch wires.
Mr Fanthorpe's bankers,

27:01.203 --> 27:03.723
his past employers, the station
where he was raised, here,

27:03.724 --> 27:05.842
the institute where he trained.

27:05.843 --> 27:09.123
All and anything that might tell me
the details of his life and now this.

27:09.124 --> 27:13.362
Bradford Technical College,
with the one fact to report,

27:13.363 --> 27:17.002
that the man graduated
LAST in a class of 15.

27:17.003 --> 27:20.683
This is the genius set to transform
Mr Bruton's fortunes, is it?

27:20.684 --> 27:23.162
We are asked to believe so, yes.

27:23.163 --> 27:26.403
Mr Reid, sir,
your wife begs a moment. My wife?

27:26.404 --> 27:28.363
Unless she has a twin, sir.

27:33.043 --> 27:37.923
Emily? Edmund, I need your help.
Will you come to the shelter?

27:52.123 --> 27:55.322
Miss Goren. Good evening. Inspector.

27:55.323 --> 27:58.283
Deborah found them
at the foot of Trinity Row.

27:58.284 --> 28:02.042
Who is it did this to you?
Who do you think? A man!

28:02.043 --> 28:04.522
He is a policeman.

28:04.523 --> 28:06.242
Still a man.

28:06.243 --> 28:07.523
And also my husband.

28:14.123 --> 28:20.242
Four of them. Clipped whiskers
and long coats. Americans.

28:20.243 --> 28:24.283
They had pictures and
searched for Long Susan.

28:29.483 --> 28:31.043
Oi!

28:38.923 --> 28:40.042
Your mistress?!

28:40.043 --> 28:42.481
She's not here, sir.
She's not here, sir!

28:42.482 --> 28:44.163
'Tell me! She's not here!

28:47.163 --> 28:48.803
'Get up!'

29:50.603 --> 29:51.763
Easy...

29:55.403 --> 29:56.883
You.

29:58.643 --> 30:00.203
Stop.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.882
Who is it tells me?

30:05.883 --> 30:07.163
P-police.

30:10.883 --> 30:12.723
Now you stand your ground.

30:15.563 --> 30:16.723
No.

30:19.163 --> 30:22.203
Altar boy. I come for you.

31:55.403 --> 31:57.123
I didn't know where else to go.

32:19.043 --> 32:21.323
Artherton, why am
I roused from my home?

32:28.883 --> 32:31.643
Longshoreman pulled him
out of Shadwell Basin.

32:34.363 --> 32:35.443
Where's Jackson?

32:37.083 --> 32:40.041
Men were sent to Tenter
Street for him, sir. No sign?

32:40.042 --> 32:42.443
None. The cathouse
was empty. Ransacked.

32:50.443 --> 32:52.043
Not the boy.

32:56.763 --> 32:57.803
How, Mr Reid?

33:00.683 --> 33:01.723
I, er...

33:09.403 --> 33:12.843
He cannot have been dead longer than
ten hours and yet there is mortis.

33:20.523 --> 33:22.323
There is something in his hand.

33:42.443 --> 33:49.002
Oh, Hobbs, get men to the Fanthorpe
warehouse and find Mrs Fanthorpe.

33:49.003 --> 33:51.602
The boy was sent to follow her.

33:51.603 --> 33:54.643
Inside and out, all along that
stretch. Miss nothing. Yes, sir.

34:11.443 --> 34:13.283
Help me, Bennet.

34:23.083 --> 34:24.482
Wait. There.

34:24.483 --> 34:27.442
His spinal cord was cut.

34:27.443 --> 34:28.842
Fanthorpe had the same.

34:35.043 --> 34:36.803
All dispatched, sir.

34:38.723 --> 34:42.763
The boy was crippled, then
put into the water to drown.

34:46.443 --> 34:47.842
Sweet Jesus.

34:50.803 --> 34:54.322
Mr Reid. When you find the
persons who've done this...

34:57.123 --> 34:59.123
we may kill them, may we not, sir?

35:10.843 --> 35:12.683
Long day?

35:15.563 --> 35:17.842
The longest.

35:17.843 --> 35:20.961
A day in which your services
would have been most valued.

35:20.962 --> 35:22.801
I can't always be
by your side, Reid.

35:22.802 --> 35:25.281
And now will be so
no longer, I imagine.

35:25.282 --> 35:27.763
Now that Miss Hart's
pursuers are upon her.

35:29.283 --> 35:32.682
You still keep that ring,
locked in your desk?

35:32.683 --> 35:34.283
Then I'll have it from you.

35:42.723 --> 35:48.962
What little I know of you, I know
this. You would not fire on me.

35:48.963 --> 35:51.323
You wouldn't be the first
lawman I kill.

35:51.324 --> 35:54.003
Nonetheless, you will not kill me.

35:56.843 --> 35:59.202
No sign of Mrs Fanthorpe, sir.

35:59.203 --> 36:01.683
But there was this rag
soaked in chloroform.

36:01.684 --> 36:04.003
And this man? Would you risk him?

36:06.003 --> 36:10.683
It's my ring and I will take
it from you. Right now.

36:18.563 --> 36:24.042
You are he then, the Matthew Judge
engraved on the inner.

36:24.043 --> 36:25.083
Drake.

36:29.523 --> 36:31.083
Oblige me, will you?

36:39.163 --> 36:40.883
It was given to me by my father.

36:44.043 --> 36:47.641
Despite all the circumstances,
it does feel good to wear it again.

36:47.642 --> 36:50.481
You should know, whoever put
the knife in the engineer's back,

36:50.482 --> 36:52.763
they did the same to
Dick Hobbs this day.

36:53.883 --> 36:55.762
I'm sorry to hear that.

36:55.763 --> 36:59.521
Another fact, he's in
mortis no longer than ten
hours since his murdering.

36:59.522 --> 37:02.963
Before you run, you have any
thoughts as to how this can be so?

37:06.203 --> 37:08.721
Drownings, on occasion,
if the water's very cold

37:08.722 --> 37:12.601
and the shock of it, er, immediate,
the body can convulse

37:12.602 --> 37:15.561
and lock itself immediately
in a cadaveric spasm.

37:15.562 --> 37:17.643
The effects developing into mortis.

37:20.243 --> 37:24.603
That a service to you? Yes, it is.
Well, I'm glad of that at least.

37:24.604 --> 37:27.122
Stop him! Stop that man!

37:27.123 --> 37:29.442
Drake! Wait, wait! Let him go!

37:29.443 --> 37:30.922
Let him go.

37:30.923 --> 37:34.243
That man?! Back to work!
Back to work! Here...

37:38.643 --> 37:42.441
Now, there are others more
deserving of your rage, Sergeant.

37:42.442 --> 37:45.363
The same men pursue
Miss Hart as finished Fanthorpe,

37:45.364 --> 37:48.842
murdered Hobbs and abducted
Martha Fanthorpe.

37:48.843 --> 37:50.761
Now, this spasm just spoke of,

37:50.762 --> 37:53.961
it resembles rigor mortis
but presents itself earlier.

37:53.962 --> 37:56.161
In which event, this man Goodnight

37:56.162 --> 37:59.841
and his master can no longer claim
themselves absent from London.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.881
What are they to gain
from taking this woman?

38:01.882 --> 38:05.281
They wanted the engineer dead, he is
dead. They don't have all the facts.

38:05.282 --> 38:08.641
Bruton has a secret.
He's been guarding it for years.

38:08.642 --> 38:11.203
It wasn't Samuel Fanthorpe
he built his hopes upon.

38:11.204 --> 38:16.002
It is his wife, Martha.
She might secure Swift's defeat.

38:16.003 --> 38:17.563
Then why keep her alive?

38:17.564 --> 38:22.682
If I am right, a woman like this,
with strength to hide herself

38:22.683 --> 38:28.522
yet to perform such genius, she may
be too valuable to extinguish.

38:28.523 --> 38:31.723
If we find Martha Fanthorpe,
we shall have our answers.

38:47.723 --> 38:48.763
Susan!

38:53.803 --> 38:55.083
Susan?!

38:59.043 --> 39:00.163
Susan!

39:09.843 --> 39:13.841
'Matthew, despite what I have
said, your arrival in my life,

39:13.842 --> 39:17.121
'it is still the greatest
happiness I have known.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.643
'I go to give them something
of what they want from us

39:19.644 --> 39:24.083
'in the hope they will let
you run. So you do that. You run.'

39:50.483 --> 39:55.043
I rack myself to think why
I should not scatter your brains
over this fine furniture.

39:58.323 --> 39:59.363
Search the place.

40:02.483 --> 40:05.241
What the hell is this?!
What are you doing?!

40:05.242 --> 40:07.961
Just a few questions.
Get your hands off me!

40:07.962 --> 40:10.923
You take a trip to Bow Creek
of late, Mr Goodnight?

40:10.924 --> 40:13.162
What happens there, Reid?

40:13.163 --> 40:17.962
Women are drugged and abducted.
A young lad gets killed.

40:17.963 --> 40:19.163
Oh?

40:22.683 --> 40:25.722
Where is Martha Fanthorpe?

40:25.723 --> 40:28.683
I have no idea of who
you speak, Inspector.

40:28.684 --> 40:30.562
Mr Reid!

40:30.563 --> 40:33.322
You have taken
leave of yourself, sir.

40:33.323 --> 40:36.642
And? Nothing. She's not here.

40:36.643 --> 40:40.363
You put that gun down
and you explain yourself!

40:41.403 --> 40:44.241
I'd ask how it is you come to
associate with kidnappers

40:44.242 --> 40:46.443
and murderers, Mr Goldman. Slander!

40:47.523 --> 40:49.122
Your proof, Inspector?

40:49.123 --> 40:50.963
He has none.

40:52.283 --> 40:55.283
Well, Reid? Justify yourself, man.

41:08.483 --> 41:10.201
You will burn for this, Inspector!

41:10.202 --> 41:12.841
Perhaps. But if
I am right, Mr Goldman,

41:12.842 --> 41:16.681
and you have simply sat by to admire
the dividend you make from kidnap

41:16.682 --> 41:18.083
and murder, so will you.

41:37.243 --> 41:38.363
Thank you, Daniel.

41:43.683 --> 41:47.402
Theodore. We've worked
hard for you here.

41:47.403 --> 41:49.803
And in six hours' time,
we'll provide the funds

41:49.804 --> 41:54.002
by which Argentine Marine votes
itself into your ownership.

41:54.003 --> 41:57.962
That achieved, you
and your men will leave

41:57.963 --> 42:01.203
and you will not darken
these halls again.

42:08.483 --> 42:09.643
What?

42:12.003 --> 42:15.922
Will you kill me?
You think me incapable of it?

42:15.923 --> 42:18.123
I didn't say that, Caitlin.

42:20.003 --> 42:24.882
So, what is it brings you here?

42:24.883 --> 42:27.483
There's a kindness
I'd ask of you. Kind?

42:28.603 --> 42:31.483
Isn't a word you ever had much
call to use in my direction.

42:31.484 --> 42:36.003
Let Matthew be. Call Frank
Goodnight and his dogs off.

42:37.203 --> 42:39.882
I invited the man into my home,

42:39.883 --> 42:44.081
paid his wage to keep watch
on you. So he steals you from me,

42:44.082 --> 42:46.483
ships you here to live
as a cathouse madam.

42:47.883 --> 42:51.082
Now you wish me to
forgive that insult,

42:51.083 --> 42:53.523
I'd know what you offer in return.

42:55.323 --> 42:58.522
Myself. You may take me home again.

42:58.523 --> 43:01.963
And if you still
consider me marriageable,
I shall divorce my husband.

43:01.964 --> 43:04.642
Should I allow him to live.

43:04.643 --> 43:09.202
And accept your choice for me.
Whatever's your pleasure.

43:09.203 --> 43:12.562
Theodore, Goldman is... Frank!

43:12.563 --> 43:15.161
If you or any of your
men harm my daughter,

43:15.162 --> 43:17.843
you will find yourself
outside my protection.

43:43.723 --> 43:45.403
Barnes!

43:47.963 --> 43:50.723
Have them bring in last
week's maritime trades.

43:51.883 --> 43:55.602
All sales of Argentine Marine,

43:55.603 --> 43:58.843
all acquisitions of
Swift Intercontinental.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.762
No, Theodore. It was understood!

44:05.763 --> 44:07.682
I understand your rage.

44:07.683 --> 44:11.203
But she is my daughter and I have
undertaken to bring you to heel.

44:11.204 --> 44:12.602
I am not your dog.

44:12.603 --> 44:16.762
Oh yes, Frank. You are.
You let Matthew Judge run.

44:16.763 --> 44:21.123
Besides, there's more than one way
to skin this particular cat...

44:23.723 --> 44:25.403
if you have the stomach for it?

44:58.723 --> 45:02.802
Here. Just yesterday.

45:02.803 --> 45:06.162
A vast number of Argentine
sold at cutdown.

45:06.163 --> 45:11.202
And then, minutes later, the same
trader makes a sizeable acquisition

45:11.203 --> 45:13.082
in Swift Intercontinental.

45:13.083 --> 45:16.161
Have you been able to discover on
whose behalf the trade was made?

45:16.162 --> 45:19.563
An employee of the company itself.
A man named Fields.

45:33.603 --> 45:34.643
Mr Reid!

45:44.203 --> 45:45.243
Peek-a-boo.

45:49.163 --> 45:51.761
Mr Fields,
never make a plan in haste.

45:51.762 --> 45:54.441
Who could blame you,
once Fanthorpe was found dead,

45:54.442 --> 45:57.961
of wanting to disencumber yourself
from falling Argentine stock?

45:57.962 --> 46:03.163
Did Bruton fail to inform you till
after the fact that it was with
the lady where the inspiration lay?

46:05.243 --> 46:11.081
I have worked endlessly, every
breathing moment of my adult life
for that family. What was I to do?

46:11.082 --> 46:13.481
Watch my entire
livelihood go up in flames

46:13.482 --> 46:15.401
with no safeguard for my future?

46:15.402 --> 46:17.641
So you went to Swift
and told him what you knew?

46:17.642 --> 46:21.001
He promised she would not be harmed.
Once the sale was completed

46:21.002 --> 46:23.081
and he left the city,
she could be released.

46:23.082 --> 46:27.443
But a man from my company got
in their road and he paid for it,
with his life.

46:31.203 --> 46:33.762
Surely this interrogation can wait,

46:33.763 --> 46:36.602
Inspector?
The shareholders' meeting?

46:36.603 --> 46:39.961
They've not started yet, Miss.
Do you have a carriage? We do.

46:39.962 --> 46:43.363
Then show me to it.
And don't "Miss" me, Sergeant.

46:57.683 --> 47:01.883
This extraordinary shareholders'
meeting will come to order.

47:14.323 --> 47:18.283
As you know, there is but
one item upon the agenda.

47:19.563 --> 47:22.203
Unless Mr Bruton
has anything to say?

47:25.163 --> 47:27.723
I suggest we move
directly to a vote.

47:29.203 --> 47:32.002
All those in favour
of forced sale...

47:32.003 --> 47:33.723
Wait there, if you please, sir.

47:35.803 --> 47:39.323
Before votes are cast,
there are facts you should learn.

47:44.923 --> 47:46.363
Martha?

48:02.003 --> 48:03.803
I want to watch you swing, scum!

48:06.003 --> 48:09.881
Gentlemen, calm down.
What is this? Explain yourself, sir!

48:09.882 --> 48:13.843
No, I should allow Mrs Fanthorpe
and Mr Bruton to do that.

48:13.844 --> 48:15.802
Get him out of here.

48:15.803 --> 48:19.162
Please, gentleman. Take your seats.

48:19.163 --> 48:22.403
May the lady and I have
five minutes of your time?

48:22.404 --> 48:24.442
But for what purpose, sir?

48:24.443 --> 48:29.322
To show you, I hope, that all
is not lost for our company,

48:29.323 --> 48:35.722
that we assemble an innovation
to our engines that will render ours

48:35.723 --> 48:39.682
the fastest fleet in all
commercial maritime history.

48:39.683 --> 48:42.202
But our engineer is dead, is he not?

48:42.203 --> 48:44.962
Mr Fanthorpe may sadly be so, yes.

48:44.963 --> 48:50.562
But he is not, and has
never been, our engineer.

48:50.563 --> 48:56.722
That privilege, ours too,
belongs to Mrs Fanthorpe.

48:56.723 --> 48:58.202
A woman?!

48:58.203 --> 49:00.322
I am that, sir, yes.

49:00.323 --> 49:05.762
You have lost all reason.
No, Mr Bruton, a thousand times no!

49:05.763 --> 49:07.722
Martha, please sit!

49:07.723 --> 49:11.042
A female engineer? Never! No, sir...

49:11.043 --> 49:13.601
Gentlemen, please...
No, sir, I shan't accept...

49:13.602 --> 49:17.323
It will only take a moment to listen
to Mrs Fanthorpe's proposals.

49:17.324 --> 49:18.603
Gentlemen!

49:36.563 --> 49:39.762
Inspector!
I'm glad to have found you.

49:39.763 --> 49:42.801
Wanted you to be the first
to comment on your employing

49:42.802 --> 49:45.841
of Matthew Judge, a wanted
murderer and the abductor

49:45.842 --> 49:47.963
of the daughter
of Mr Theodore Swift.

49:49.283 --> 49:52.563
Mr Best, I'm afraid the story
has moved on a yard or two now.

50:10.363 --> 50:13.402
Nobody move or
I snap his goddamn neck!

50:13.403 --> 50:15.203
Everybody stay where they are!

50:23.963 --> 50:25.403
Next one's in your head, Frank.

50:27.763 --> 50:28.883
Let him go.

50:31.003 --> 50:32.683
I let him go, they kill me.

50:32.684 --> 50:34.722
I will if you don't.

50:34.723 --> 50:37.843
If you do, they're going to give you
what you want most in this world...

50:42.043 --> 50:43.763
your chance at me.

50:45.923 --> 50:48.963
One shell a man, one shot apiece.

50:52.603 --> 50:53.643
Toss 'em!

50:59.083 --> 51:00.683
You still got that piece I gave you?

51:08.043 --> 51:09.763
Take out all the brass bar one.

51:15.843 --> 51:17.682
Give it to him.

51:17.683 --> 51:18.843
Do it.

51:40.763 --> 51:41.923
You kept in training?

51:42.963 --> 51:44.003
Not so much.

51:46.203 --> 51:47.243
Then I fear for you.

51:50.523 --> 51:55.522
I do work with one
advantage, however.

51:55.523 --> 51:56.723
You want to tell me?

52:05.563 --> 52:06.683
It's my home field.

52:51.283 --> 52:53.242
Always were a faker.

52:53.243 --> 52:55.643
You shouldn't have
killed the boy, Frank.

53:25.283 --> 53:28.123
I never knew a man who could
make cheating so heroic.

53:35.643 --> 53:37.523
Care to take a turn
with me, Miss Hart?

53:39.003 --> 53:40.043
I will.

53:52.443 --> 53:53.883
I know no man named Judge.

53:55.003 --> 53:57.083
I do know a man named Homer Jackson,

53:57.084 --> 54:00.122
however, a police surgeon
in this quarter

54:00.123 --> 54:03.881
who just took down a cold-blooded,
murdering Pinkerton out of New York.

54:03.882 --> 54:05.523
That story enough for you, Best?

54:07.123 --> 54:09.123
For now, Inspector.

54:13.963 --> 54:16.562
He was a mad dog, that one.

54:16.563 --> 54:19.522
His actions,
no man could control them.

54:19.523 --> 54:24.722
Your bodyguard, a lone killer
acting on his own whim?

54:24.723 --> 54:27.843
You think that's enough
to spare you, do you?

54:27.844 --> 54:29.283
I KNOW it will be.

54:30.923 --> 54:35.923
Think of all the great men
who have made their fortunes
through me, Mr Reid.

54:35.924 --> 54:37.882
All that I know of them.

54:37.883 --> 54:41.203
All that I will tell
from behind your bars.

55:23.843 --> 55:26.802
You will not regret this,
Mrs Fanthorpe.

55:26.803 --> 55:29.721
You have promised me the full
expression of my talents

55:29.722 --> 55:32.723
and vision and that is all
I've ever wanted from this life.

55:32.724 --> 55:35.723
Then you travel in
the correct direction.

55:36.803 --> 55:40.002
America will prove much
more accommodating.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.243
Not so stuck in its
ways as this place.

55:44.203 --> 55:48.723
A woman like you, you
will do very well indeed.

56:20.443 --> 56:23.682
So is this the lot
for a bobby's wife, then?

56:23.683 --> 56:26.323
Never knowing when
you're likely to come home?

56:26.324 --> 56:29.242
Yeah, it can be.

56:29.243 --> 56:35.083
And as you've said not long past,
it is not much of a life.

56:37.123 --> 56:41.403
You, er, you come to me
out of fear, Rose.

56:42.843 --> 56:46.243
Not natural affection.

56:48.883 --> 56:50.323
I know I'm not much.

56:52.443 --> 56:54.243
But I am worth better than that.

56:55.563 --> 56:57.522
Then what's to become of me?

56:57.523 --> 57:01.322
Your mistress is returned
to her house.

57:01.323 --> 57:03.203
You could do likewise if you wish.

57:03.204 --> 57:07.522
And if I do not? If I decide
to finish with that life?

57:07.523 --> 57:12.563
Then you must be brave,
Rose, and look for another.

57:16.123 --> 57:17.723
Now get along with you, girl.

57:38.203 --> 57:40.602
Chief Inspector Abberline?

57:40.603 --> 57:43.163
This man's rooms, now.

57:45.443 --> 57:47.722
There!

57:47.723 --> 57:51.203
Another tart's been ripped.
Another snitch sends me to you.

58:08.803 --> 58:10.283
Take him.

58:12.643 --> 58:16.681
Do you think that hanging my American
will return your sleep to you?

58:16.682 --> 58:18.121
Are you so desperate, Inspector,

58:18.122 --> 58:21.483
that you rake through all
the suspects we ever knew?

58:21.484 --> 58:23.483
I believe him returned.

58:26.243 --> 58:29.203
What use our work if we cannot
care for those we love?

58:30.084 --> 58:59.960
