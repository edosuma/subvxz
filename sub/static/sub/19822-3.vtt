12:53.507 --> 12:55.774
Great to see you too, Emily.

12:59.079 --> 13:01.012
Tim's gonna be here any minute.

13:01.081 --> 13:02.747
You've gotta help me
clean up this place.

13:02.816 --> 13:05.150
It looks fine. What's
going on with the safe?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.417
Did they get it open?

13:06.486 --> 13:07.952
I don't know, I've been busy!

13:08.021 --> 13:10.255
(doorbell chimes)

13:10.323 --> 13:12.157
Keep the door closed. (grunts)

13:14.694 --> 13:17.529
Hey, Tim, great to see you.

13:17.597 --> 13:18.530
Come on in.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.299
No.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.569
Hi, Tim.

13:27.974 --> 13:30.708
Oh, yeah, this stuff
is powerful stinky.

13:30.777 --> 13:32.544
Totally gonna work.

13:34.514 --> 13:37.582
Whoa, that's totally not gonna work.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.417
What'd you put in this?

13:39.486 --> 13:42.487
This is useless.

13:42.556 --> 13:44.155
I found Rinus.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.423
He was really nice at first,

13:45.492 --> 13:48.159
but then when I mentioned
Saganash, he...

13:48.228 --> 13:49.694
What is that?

13:49.763 --> 13:52.797
Apparently, it's garbage.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.334
What did he do when you
mentioned Saganash?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.870
He went nuts and chased
me out of there.

13:58.939 --> 13:59.904
Tim is here.

13:59.973 --> 14:03.174
All right.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.610
Let's get this over with.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.252
So, are these all the
combinations Sal tried?

14:14.321 --> 14:16.120
Good luck with it.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.290
There's, like, a zillion
different combinations.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.798
(clicking)

14:26.867 --> 14:27.832
(tumblers clicking)

14:27.901 --> 14:30.768
Oh, you are so picking
my lottery numbers.

14:30.837 --> 14:33.171
The combination is 1978.

14:33.240 --> 14:34.906
1978? The year Kate was born.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.642
Erik uses it as his pin
code for everything.

14:50.757 --> 14:51.689
Max?!

14:51.758 --> 14:52.757
Sal?

14:52.826 --> 14:54.125
(knocking) Max?

15:00.901 --> 15:02.734
Whoa.

15:05.872 --> 15:07.672
(Max) Whoa.

15:10.076 --> 15:13.411
Guys, stop fooling around!
Open the door!

15:16.149 --> 15:17.882
(Max) It's an old machine.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.851
You're kidding me.

15:22.122 --> 15:25.290
(phone vibrating)

15:25.358 --> 15:26.557
Sal?

15:26.626 --> 15:28.226
I can't open it.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.460
Push the door as hard as you can.

15:31.498 --> 15:32.730
It won't work.

15:32.799 --> 15:33.765
<i>Come on, man, you can do it.</i>

15:33.833 --> 15:35.433
Just give it all your power, okay?

15:35.502 --> 15:37.201
Okay.

15:45.578 --> 15:46.511
(Sal cries out in pain)

15:48.081 --> 15:50.348
You okay? Sal?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.986
Check this out.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.628
Whoa.

16:03.697 --> 16:05.330
It's a tunnel.

16:05.398 --> 16:07.165
Another... secret room.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.334
This is not a normal house.

16:13.239 --> 16:16.507
You coming? Tim's waiting.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.709
(exasperated sigh)

16:26.920 --> 16:29.654
(Tess) Maybe this is our way out.

16:33.226 --> 16:37.462
Uh, just hold it for two minutes
and, uh, and do the other side.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.464
I do it at least five times a day.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.466
My abs are... like slabs.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.700
(chuckling)

16:42.769 --> 16:45.236
Yeah, your workout routine
is very interesting.

16:45.305 --> 16:46.637
But I'm kind of in a hurry.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.706
So, is Max coming?

16:48.775 --> 16:50.241
He should be right here.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.242
(chuckling)

16:51.311 --> 16:53.678
Oh, that's him now.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.880
(Daniel) Oh, it's you.

16:55.949 --> 16:56.914
(laughing weakly)

16:56.983 --> 16:59.183
What did I do?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.986
Hi, Sal. Where's Max?

17:02.055 --> 17:06.624
Oh, Max. He, he was just with me.

17:06.693 --> 17:11.295
He must've gone to, uh...
change his shirt.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.165
You know, Max, always
wants to look his best.

17:18.137 --> 17:20.238
All right.

17:20.306 --> 17:22.507
Just a little darkness.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.675
Nothing we can't handle.

17:34.654 --> 17:38.456
Uh, anyone know any good jokes?

17:38.525 --> 17:40.058
Oh, I do.

17:40.126 --> 17:43.461
What do you get when you cross
a potato with an elephant?

17:43.530 --> 17:45.430
(chuckling) I don't know.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.632
Mashed potatoes.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.235
(laughter)

17:51.304 --> 17:52.904
Mashed potatoes?

17:52.972 --> 17:57.141
'Cause the elephant steps on the
potato and the potato goes...

17:57.210 --> 18:00.445
I think I'd like to speak
to Kate and Erik now.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.947
Uhh...

18:05.118 --> 18:08.686
♪♪

18:23.403 --> 18:24.335
(coughs)

18:25.405 --> 18:27.338
No. No-no-no-no, come on.

18:27.407 --> 18:29.006
What? Not now.

18:29.075 --> 18:30.408
The battery died.

18:30.477 --> 18:31.809
I can't see a thing here.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.144
Oh, calm down.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.546
Just let your eyes adjust
to the dark for a minute.

18:35.615 --> 18:36.914
Adjust? Yeah.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.015
What?

18:38.084 --> 18:40.651
Wait, why is there no floor here?

18:40.720 --> 18:41.719
What do you mean, there's no fl...

18:41.788 --> 18:45.089
Whoa! Whoa!

18:45.158 --> 18:48.226
(both screaming)

18:48.294 --> 18:50.928
(Max) Oh! Ow! (coughing)

18:53.500 --> 18:55.032
Is that my boy over there?

18:55.101 --> 18:56.400
What's up, man?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.569
Are you making trouble again?
You promised me...

18:58.638 --> 19:00.004
Uh, no, no, he's not making trouble.

19:00.073 --> 19:03.441
Uh, he and Tess were just, uh...

19:03.510 --> 19:05.877
Cleaning the ventilation systems.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.879
These old houses, you know.

19:07.947 --> 19:09.380
Yeah.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.048
Look...

19:11.117 --> 19:14.952
I don't know what you guys are up to,

19:15.021 --> 19:17.088
but you're all standing up for Max.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.960
And no family has ever
done that before, so...

19:23.029 --> 19:26.764
I guess things must be going okay.

19:29.636 --> 19:32.236
But I still have to
speak to Kate and Erik.

19:32.305 --> 19:34.305
Could someone get them?

19:34.374 --> 19:38.209
No, sorry, they, they just went out.

19:38.278 --> 19:43.247
Oh, okay, uh, well...

19:43.316 --> 19:46.184
Could you do me a favor
and tell them I came by?

19:46.252 --> 19:48.686
Sure, no probs.

19:48.755 --> 19:51.355
Thanks. Take it easy, guys.

19:51.424 --> 19:53.791
I'll see you later.

19:58.097 --> 19:59.030
(exhaling)

19:59.098 --> 20:01.265
(Sal) They went out?

20:01.334 --> 20:02.633
What kind of story is that?

20:02.702 --> 20:04.368
I can't believe he bought it.

20:04.437 --> 20:05.870
Rule number one when making up a story,

20:05.939 --> 20:07.705
keep it simple.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.640
You have a lot to learn.

20:12.011 --> 20:16.380
(grunting)

20:22.055 --> 20:24.288
Pushing it doesn't work anymore.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.324
Let a professional do it.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.059
(clears throat)

20:32.865 --> 20:36.267
(groaning)

20:36.336 --> 20:37.768
It's all in the hips.

20:52.185 --> 20:53.951
So, uh, what is it?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.019
I'm not sure.

20:55.088 --> 20:56.020
Let me see.

20:57.223 --> 20:58.756
Careful! Don't break it.

20:58.825 --> 21:00.191
Relax.

21:00.260 --> 21:03.194
I'm what they call an
experiential learner.

21:03.263 --> 21:05.463
I figure stuff out by
messing around with it.

21:05.531 --> 21:06.764
(whirring)

21:06.833 --> 21:08.266
Oh!

21:12.705 --> 21:14.905
This is a telegraph machine.

21:14.974 --> 21:15.973
A tele-what?

21:16.042 --> 21:17.275
Telegraph.

21:17.343 --> 21:18.709
It's how people used to communicate

21:18.778 --> 21:20.411
before they invented the telephone.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.213
I built an app that
translates Morse Code.

21:22.282 --> 21:23.214
Of course you did.

21:24.751 --> 21:29.387
(beeping)

21:29.455 --> 21:32.123
It's a message.

21:32.191 --> 21:35.660
"Hunters, stop.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.595
Are you receiv..."

21:37.664 --> 21:40.064
That's it. There's no more.

21:40.133 --> 21:41.799
There has to be more.

21:44.137 --> 21:45.069
(electrical zapping)

21:46.306 --> 21:47.972
I think you broke it. Me?!

21:48.041 --> 21:50.141
Guys, come on.

21:50.209 --> 21:52.576
This could be a real clue.

21:52.645 --> 21:57.148
The big question is,
who sent this message?
