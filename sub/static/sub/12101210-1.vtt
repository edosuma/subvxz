WEBVTT

00:16.015 --> 00:17.682
Yeah, I hear you.

00:19.386 --> 00:20.251
I hear you.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.452
No, I'm not.

00:21.454 --> 00:23.287
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not near
the prison.

00:23.289 --> 00:25.356
I'm waiting for him near the bus
station.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.226
Oh my God.

00:28.228 --> 00:30.228
How many times we have to go
over this.

00:31.398 --> 00:32.530
Mom you're making it out

00:32.531 --> 00:34.232
like he's Pablo Escobar or
something.

00:35.001 --> 00:36.434
20 pounds of
weed.

00:36.436 --> 00:37.535
Yeah, I know.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.237
I know, I know, I know how much
it was.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.940
I was there, it was a lot,
but he's my best friend.

00:44.044 --> 00:45.943
Yeah, and plus if it wasn't for
him,

00:45.945 --> 00:48.479
we would've all gotten busted.

01:02.095 --> 01:04.394
Okay, yeah mama, mom, I know, I
know.

01:04.397 --> 01:05.229
I got call you back, okay?

01:05.230 --> 01:06.130
Okay, bye.

01:07.767 --> 01:12.403
There he is, fresh out of
prison, hey!

01:15.175 --> 01:16.174
You did it brother.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.012
Okay, that's you.

01:22.816 --> 01:25.016
Man, I can believe it man.

01:28.421 --> 01:31.589
Man, you took your jumpsuit?

01:31.591 --> 01:32.824
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:32.826 --> 01:34.425
A memento I guess.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.028
It kinda stuck with me after six
years.

01:37.030 --> 01:38.362
I can dig it.

01:38.364 --> 01:39.931
We can put it on the wall,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.366
frame it like it's your
championship Jersey.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.102
Everybody gotta come in
and take a picture with it.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.436
They'd be like.

01:45.438 --> 01:47.271
- I don't think so.
- No, Okay, all right.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.173
Oh, I hope you're hungry though

01:49.175 --> 01:50.942
'cause I brought your favorite.

01:50.944 --> 01:51.776
No, a double?

01:51.778 --> 01:52.877
You know it brother.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.145
I'd kill for one of those
right now.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.547
Hey, hey, hey, relax man.

01:56.549 --> 01:59.217
We don't want you to go back in
there.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.518
You ain't gotta kill no one.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.954
I'm just joking, I'm just
joking.

02:02.956 --> 02:03.821
I was just joking.

02:03.823 --> 02:04.622
A little jokey joke you know.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.491
To soon, maybe?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.459
- You think?
- A little bit?

02:09.628 --> 02:11.529
Come on, a little.

02:11.531 --> 02:12.997
I missed you dog.

02:15.502 --> 02:17.535
Man, I missed these so much.

02:17.537 --> 02:19.871
Yeah, you used to order
like three at a time

02:19.873 --> 02:21.806
when we were in college.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.541
True, I was a little hog boy.

02:23.543 --> 02:24.742
No you weren't.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.078
Man, look at this.

02:28.481 --> 02:29.981
These used to be tight on me.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.383
I had a kangaroo pouch for a
stomach.

02:32.385 --> 02:33.751
Damn man, you're little.

02:38.758 --> 02:41.325
Can I see your papers?

02:41.327 --> 02:42.860
Yeah, of course.

02:52.305 --> 02:54.772
Well, it doesn't get
anymore realer than that.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.175
You're a free man.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.243
Cheers to that.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.884
- My bad!
- Man!

03:06.886 --> 03:08.252
Okay look, I'll clean it.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.023
I'll clean it.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.391
Dude, what are you doing?

03:14.827 --> 03:17.762
It's better just to remove
the stain with one big lick

03:17.764 --> 03:20.298
and then you just tap, tap, tap,
tap.

03:21.534 --> 03:22.867
You dab it with some napkins

03:22.869 --> 03:24.802
that way it doesn't spread
everywhere.

03:25.638 --> 03:29.207
- Who says that?
- Says me man and everybody.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.641
One time before a job interview,

03:30.643 --> 03:33.477
I spilled syrup on my resume
and then I licked it off

03:33.479 --> 03:34.579
with one clean swipe.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.985
I mean, I didn't say I
got the job but still.

03:45.258 --> 03:47.458
Well, it's not that bad I
guess.

03:47.460 --> 03:48.492
It could be worse.

03:48.494 --> 03:50.461
Hell yeah, it could be worse
man.

03:50.463 --> 03:51.963
You're out of that shit hole.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.266
Shit, I mean I still can't
believe it.

03:56.169 --> 03:57.335
Six years?

03:58.504 --> 03:59.437
Yeah.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.106
- Crazy.
- Hey, by the way man,

04:02.108 --> 04:03.474
I really appreciate
letting me stay with you

04:03.476 --> 04:04.342
until I find a job.

04:04.344 --> 04:05.810
Yeah, of course man.

04:05.812 --> 04:08.145
Of course, like I said, I
got plenty of room for you.

04:09.382 --> 04:11.249
Hey, it's gonna be fun man,

04:11.251 --> 04:12.783
like college all over again.

04:12.785 --> 04:14.485
Yeah, but I promise
as soon as I get a job,

04:14.487 --> 04:15.319
I'll help you with the rent.

04:15.321 --> 04:16.620
Hey, stop, stop that, man.

04:16.623 --> 04:17.922
Look, I got you.

04:17.923 --> 04:19.923
I'm making more than
enough to cover the rent.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.194
Oh, because of your clothing
line?

04:23.196 --> 04:25.496
You damn right 'cause
of my clothing line.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.265
Say that again that sound pretty
good.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.166
Because of your clothing line.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.003
So it's going well, huh?

04:32.005 --> 04:36.040
Yeah, yeah it is actually.

04:38.611 --> 04:39.977
You know to be honest man,

04:41.814 --> 04:44.782
I really wasn't expecting
it to be this much work.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.550
It's kinda taking up my whole
life

04:46.552 --> 04:49.520
but yeah I mean, that's part of
the reason

04:49.522 --> 04:53.157
why I couldn't visit you
at all the last few months.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.995
But yeah anyway, like
I said man, I'm sorry.

04:57.997 --> 04:59.563
I'm really sorry about that.

04:59.565 --> 05:01.065
Hey look, don't worry about
it.

05:04.237 --> 05:05.336
I totally understand.

05:06.673 --> 05:11.042
But if there's anything I
can do, just let me know.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.978
I got pretty good at doing
dishes and sweeping floors, so.

05:15.281 --> 05:16.580
I'll keep that in mind.

05:18.518 --> 05:20.051
I got a French maid outfit in
the closet.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.419
Shut the fuck up.

05:25.024 --> 05:26.190
All right man, let's get out
of here.

05:26.192 --> 05:27.692
I gotta show you something.

07:09.871 --> 07:14.871

M_I_SForEver

07:23.042 --> 07:24.675
Right, here we are.

07:27.046 --> 07:29.213
Holy shit, this is your house.

07:29.215 --> 07:30.681
Oh no, no, no, man,

07:30.683 --> 07:31.982
this is the Share Pad we're
staying at for the night.

07:31.984 --> 07:34.018
- A what?
- Share Pad.

07:35.822 --> 07:37.188
Right, Share Pad wasn't really a
thing

07:37.190 --> 07:39.023
when we were in college.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.291
Okay wait, I'm confused,

07:40.293 --> 07:41.826
if this isn't your house
then why are we here?

07:41.828 --> 07:43.828
Okay, so we rented this house
to stay at for the tonight.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.296
- Who's we?
- Kate and I.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.832
We rented it from, what's his
name?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.802
It's Dylan Baker.

07:53.239 --> 07:56.407
- What?
- The house is Dylan Baker's.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.309
No, who the fuck is Dylan
Baker?

07:58.311 --> 07:59.877
Did you say that was coming here
today?

07:59.879 --> 08:01.245
- Yeah.
- Shit.

08:01.247 --> 08:02.580
Okay, okay, okay, now look,

08:02.582 --> 08:03.914
let's rewind a bit.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.184
Okay look, first off, a
Share Pad is like a hotel

08:07.186 --> 08:09.653
but you can stay at
random people's houses.

08:09.655 --> 08:10.988
That sounds like a terrible
idea.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.057
But actually it's a million
dollar idea.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.926
And also Kate and I, we were
planning

08:15.928 --> 08:18.195
to throw you a little surprise
party

08:18.197 --> 08:20.397
for your getting out of prison.

08:20.399 --> 08:21.499
A surprise party?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.733
It was most of her idea not
mine.

08:24.604 --> 08:27.104
Also she invited Alison and
Pete.

08:27.106 --> 08:28.772
- What?
- Yeah.

08:28.774 --> 08:31.175
No, no man, I'm not
ready to see them yet.

08:31.177 --> 08:35.578
I mean, okay look Allison's
one thing but Pete?

08:35.581 --> 08:36.413
Okay, I know man.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.748
I know, I know.

08:37.750 --> 08:39.517
Look, it may seem like it
could be a lot all right

08:39.519 --> 08:42.720
but let's just try, it could be
fun.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.090
Can we just go back to your
house, get a case of beer

08:46.092 --> 08:48.859
and just drink till we
pass out or something?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.597
- I'm serious.
- I know you are all right,

08:53.599 --> 08:55.966
but we can do the same thing
here.

08:55.968 --> 08:57.301
Okay come on, come on,

08:57.303 --> 09:00.204
let's at least just take
a look inside, all right?

09:00.206 --> 09:01.705
Maybe it'll change your mind?

09:03.910 --> 09:05.576
- Fine.
- Fine, yeah?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.645
But only because this
burger's going right through me.

09:07.647 --> 09:11.215
Hey, whatever it takes to
get you in the house my man.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.552
We got a lot of toilet
paper inside too big dog.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.920
Come on, it's gonna be good.

09:24.096 --> 09:25.729
So what do you think?

09:25.731 --> 09:26.564
Yeah, it's a nice.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.065
Where's the bathroom.

09:28.067 --> 09:29.934
Oh, it's straight here to the
left.

10:02.034 --> 10:02.933
It's one night.

10:05.404 --> 10:06.337
I get to see Kate.

10:21.921 --> 10:23.487
All right, I'm in.

10:23.489 --> 10:26.357
Good, cause the turkey's
already in defrosted.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.025
I can see that.

10:28.027 --> 10:29.526
You're really going all out for
this, huh?

10:29.528 --> 10:32.229
Oh, not just me, everyone's
bringing a dish for tonight.

10:32.231 --> 10:34.131
Of course they are.

10:34.133 --> 10:36.900
Okay dude, you got
to be the first person

10:36.902 --> 10:38.135
who has ever complained

10:38.137 --> 10:39.870
about their getting out of
prison party.

10:39.872 --> 10:41.572
That's because getting
out of prison parties

10:41.574 --> 10:42.873
aren't really a thing.

10:42.875 --> 10:43.907
Oh, they're not a thing?

10:43.909 --> 10:45.509
No.

10:45.511 --> 10:47.745
You don't think rappers turn
up when they get out of jail?

10:47.747 --> 10:49.346
You don't think those big wig
millionaires

10:49.348 --> 10:51.248
that get busted for
embezzlement don't know

10:51.250 --> 10:54.251
how to throw a little soiree
with hookers and strippers?

10:56.589 --> 10:57.855
I'll call you some hookers if
you want,

10:57.857 --> 10:59.256
I got one on speed dial right
now.

10:59.258 --> 11:00.858
Jay, I went to jail

11:00.860 --> 11:03.594
for the possession and
distribution of marijuana.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.596
I really don't think
that warrants a party.

11:05.598 --> 11:06.730
Yeah, it does dude.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.098
It definitely warrants a party.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.535
Peter went to the drunk
tank for 20 hours in college

11:11.537 --> 11:12.736
and we threw him a rager.

11:12.738 --> 11:14.204
You definitely deserve one man.

11:14.206 --> 11:19.043
Fine, you made your point,
we'll throw the party.

11:23.716 --> 11:24.782
I'm just really tired man.

11:24.784 --> 11:29.219
All right okay look, take a
nap.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.521
Where?

11:30.523 --> 11:31.922
Anywhere man, pick a room.

11:32.825 --> 11:34.058
I can just pick a room?

11:34.060 --> 11:35.426
It doesn't matter?

11:35.428 --> 11:38.095
I don't think you really
get the concept of this.

11:38.097 --> 11:42.299
We own the house tonight.

11:42.301 --> 11:42.933
We can do whatever we want.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.606
Fine, then I pick the master
bedroom.

11:49.608 --> 11:51.141
All right then Mr. Grumpy.

11:51.143 --> 11:52.142
Don't call me Mr. Grumpy.

11:52.144 --> 11:55.312
Okay, Mr Happy-ish.

11:55.314 --> 11:56.146
Thin ice.

11:56.148 --> 11:57.247
How thin is it?

11:57.249 --> 11:58.782
Can I skate on it or will I fall
through?

11:58.784 --> 12:01.285
You say the dumbest shit
sometimes.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.795
Here we are.

12:14.500 --> 12:18.068
There are towels in the
bathroom and I'll be downstairs

12:18.070 --> 12:19.636
in the kitchen if you need me.

12:19.638 --> 12:20.938
Yeah, thanks.

12:24.176 --> 12:25.909
Get some rest man.

15:25.357 --> 15:28.592
Hey Jay, do you have any
clothes I can borrow man?

15:28.594 --> 15:29.459
Tyler?

15:32.097 --> 15:32.996
Kate.

15:35.734 --> 15:38.268
Well, don't just stand
there, give me a hug.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.271
I should probably put
on some clothes first.

15:42.107 --> 15:44.207
I think it's fine, I've seen
you naked.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.281
It's so good to see you.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.217
It's good to see you too.

15:55.988 --> 15:56.887
I missed you.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.356
Same.

16:04.463 --> 16:07.230
So, how does it feel?

16:09.301 --> 16:14.371
Yeah I mean, it's kind of
weird but I mean it's good.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.474
I just don't think it's
really sunk in yet though

16:17.476 --> 16:18.508
if that makes sense.

16:18.510 --> 16:20.243
Yeah no, it totally makes
sense.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.645
I get it.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.581
Yeah, 'cause you spent
six years in prison, right?

16:24.583 --> 16:26.350
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:26.352 --> 16:27.484
I didn't mean it like that.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.885
No, no, I know.

16:32.624 --> 16:34.157
So, how have you been?

16:35.027 --> 16:36.226
I've been good.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.663
I got promoted at my job.

16:39.665 --> 16:44.001
I didn't get a raise but
I have an office now.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.869
Well congrats on the office

16:45.871 --> 16:48.538
and I'm sorry to hear about the
raise.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.540
Thanks, it's whatever you
know.

16:50.542 --> 16:52.576
I knew I wasn't going to get one
anyway.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.178
Let's see, what else?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.016
I started teaching a yoga class.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.050
Yoga?

17:00.052 --> 17:01.451
Oh you mean

17:01.453 --> 17:02.886
that dumb stretching shit
you made me do in college.

17:02.888 --> 17:04.755
Yes, and it's not dumb.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.923
It's actually quite popular now.

17:06.925 --> 17:09.425
So wait, people pay
you to help them stretch.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.060
Well, it's more than just
stretching.

17:11.063 --> 17:13.797
I mean, it can be very
therapeutic.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.799
It really helped me a lot.

17:15.800 --> 17:20.704
Well, I don't know back in
college it was pretty boring.

17:22.241 --> 17:25.776
Well maybe, if I was teaching
it to you

17:25.778 --> 17:27.077
it wouldn't be as boring.

17:30.516 --> 17:33.617
Yeah it maybe.

17:34.686 --> 17:36.987
No, it would still be boring.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.722
Finally, where was it?

17:38.724 --> 17:41.224
In one of the bedroom closets

17:41.226 --> 17:42.559
Like, Why?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.394
Like this Dylan Baker guy is
weird.

17:44.396 --> 17:47.264
Yeah, seriously I mean,
look at this potato peeler.

17:47.266 --> 17:50.100
See, this is why men are stupid.

17:50.102 --> 17:51.635
This guy owns a million dollar
house

17:51.637 --> 17:53.236
and he can't spend more than a
dollar

17:53.238 --> 17:54.171
on a kitchen appliance.

17:54.173 --> 17:55.639
Oh boy, here we go.

17:55.641 --> 17:59.643
Okay, all I'm saying is
that men are dumb sometimes.

17:59.645 --> 18:01.478
Well, most of the time.

18:01.480 --> 18:02.512
No, no, no, no, no,

18:02.514 --> 18:04.815
look, it's not about men or
women.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.485
They're just stupid people
and then they're smart people.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.155
Oh, so your one of the smart
ones.

18:12.157 --> 18:13.957
I'm sorry, I couldn't tell.

18:13.959 --> 18:15.759
It takes one to know one, I
suppose.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.094
Oh, shut up.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.962
I hate to bring up this
riveting conversation

18:18.964 --> 18:23.333
but Jay, do you have any
clothes I can borrow?

18:23.335 --> 18:25.702
Yeah, I didn't know you
learned the whole air-dry thing

18:25.704 --> 18:27.671
in prison, I was trying to
make you feel comfortable

18:27.673 --> 18:30.974
but sure I have it a ton of
extra clothes.

18:30.976 --> 18:32.142
You know I'm always fresh with
it.

18:32.144 --> 18:34.010
You want the Monday, Tuesday or
Wednesday?

18:34.012 --> 18:35.112
We get it, you got a clothing
line.

18:35.114 --> 18:35.979
Can I have some yes?

18:35.981 --> 18:38.348
Yes, follow me young player.

18:47.793 --> 18:48.992
Alright, here it is.

18:50.162 --> 18:51.328
You're a medium, right?

18:51.330 --> 18:52.629
Yeah.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.331
Okay, here you go.

18:57.102 --> 18:58.802
And here's some joggers.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.173
Whoa, come on brother, come on
now.

19:03.175 --> 19:05.175
You don't gotta change
right in front of me,

19:05.177 --> 19:06.042
you could wait til I get out.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.511
Dude, grow the fuck up, man.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.649
Hey, can I ask you something?

19:12.651 --> 19:13.517
What?

19:15.621 --> 19:17.487
Kate, what's with the ring?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.256
When did that happen?

19:20.526 --> 19:23.894
Oh yeah, I don't know.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.228
Maybe like a month ago.

19:26.665 --> 19:27.531
A month ago?

19:27.533 --> 19:28.431
Man, how do you not know?

19:29.635 --> 19:31.434
I know that it happened fairly
recently.

19:31.436 --> 19:33.336
I mean, he didn't make it
like a big announcement

19:33.338 --> 19:34.905
on social media or anything.

19:37.342 --> 19:40.076
My bad man, I didn't know
that it'd bother you.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.077
Well, she's my ex girlfriend.

19:41.079 --> 19:41.945
Why wouldn't bother me?

19:41.947 --> 19:44.347
I mean, it was six years ago

19:44.349 --> 19:45.916
and she's been dating that
douche bag Zach

19:45.918 --> 19:47.117
for two years now.

19:47.119 --> 19:49.252
I mean, it was bound to happen
eventually.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.188
Well, if he's such a douche
bag bag,

19:51.190 --> 19:52.389
why is she marrying him?

19:52.391 --> 19:53.557
Hey, I don't know.

19:53.559 --> 19:56.793
I tried telling her but I don't
know man,

19:56.795 --> 19:59.129
we're just getting to that age
where when you ask somebody

19:59.131 --> 20:00.530
to be your girlfriend or
boyfriend

20:00.532 --> 20:02.065
it's like a marriage proposal.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.236
Maybe that's why I'm still
single.

20:07.973 --> 20:11.107
Anyway dude, look, don't get
hung up on Kate all right?.

20:11.109 --> 20:12.542
I know you loved her

20:12.544 --> 20:15.545
but you also haven't seen
another woman in six years

20:15.547 --> 20:17.814
so you're probably just horny.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.985
Yeah, probably.

20:22.987 --> 20:24.620
All right, I'm gonna head
downstairs

20:24.623 --> 20:27.958
and tomorrow night we
gonna break that dry spell.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.159
Sounds good man.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.594
Unless you've been
getting laid in prison.

20:30.596 --> 20:31.728
All right, get out.

21:00.425 --> 21:02.325
So, what'd you guys
bring?

21:02.327 --> 21:03.827
I made buffalo chicken

21:03.829 --> 21:06.696
and Michelle made beets.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.531
That sound great
together.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.166
Thank you Michelle

21:10.168 --> 21:11.868
How was traffic?

21:11.870 --> 21:13.470
Not bad actually.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.538
Yeah, we got here in pretty...

21:15.540 --> 21:16.773
- Tyler!
- Hey Pete.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.377
Dude, oh man it's so good to
see you.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.645
Yeah, it's good to see you too
man.

21:21.647 --> 21:24.681
Man look at you, like
no scars, no tattoos?

21:24.683 --> 21:26.149
You made it out pretty good.

21:27.119 --> 21:29.352
Oh, this is my girlfriend
Michelle.

21:29.354 --> 21:31.488
- Tyler, Nice to meet you.
- Michelle.

21:32.791 --> 21:36.192
Sorry, it's just I didn't
expect you to be Tyler.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.228
I'm sorry?

21:38.230 --> 21:41.231
It's just, you don't look like
someone

21:41.233 --> 21:42.666
that just got out of prison.

21:43.669 --> 21:47.804
Oh okay, thank you I guess.

21:49.174 --> 21:51.041
Justin got any beer?

21:51.043 --> 21:52.008
Yes sir.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.677
Tyler you want one?

21:53.679 --> 21:54.511
Why not?

21:54.513 --> 21:56.046
It's been a while.

21:56.048 --> 21:58.915
Hey that's right, I didn't
really think about that man.

21:58.917 --> 22:01.351
You haven't had a beer in six
years?

22:01.353 --> 22:02.519
Yeah.

22:02.521 --> 22:03.987
All right, that's worth
cheerzing for.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.021
Oh wait, hang on,

22:05.023 --> 22:06.523
let me get a picture of you
guys.

22:06.525 --> 22:10.026
- Okay.
- All right, Justin move it.

22:10.028 --> 22:11.761
Okay, there we go.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.272
Oh Michelle, can you move a
little?

22:22.274 --> 22:24.274
I just wanna get a picture
of the three of them.

22:26.311 --> 22:27.744
It'll be just one second.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.448
All right, let's do the
first one just smiling.

22:34.720 --> 22:37.787
All right, now hold your
beers up and cheers.

22:37.789 --> 22:39.356
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.258
Yeah, that's perfect!

22:46.565 --> 22:48.064
Oh hey, let's do a boomerang.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.533
Oh, absolutely fucking
not I don't want that.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.568
Let me see what it looks like?

22:51.570 --> 22:53.103
It better be in portrait mode.

22:54.673 --> 22:57.107
Hey guys, are we gonna do the
cheers or?

22:57.109 --> 22:59.142
Oh shit of course, sorry.

22:59.144 --> 23:00.043
Yeah my bad.

23:01.813 --> 23:03.480
What should we cheers to?

23:03.482 --> 23:04.381
Freedom?

23:05.650 --> 23:07.650
I was gonna say to friends.

23:07.652 --> 23:08.618
Friends and freedom.

23:08.620 --> 23:09.953
Good enough for me.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.254
- Cheers.
- Cheers boys.

23:14.092 --> 23:15.425
Just like old times.

23:19.865 --> 23:21.131
Man, find you someone

23:21.133 --> 23:23.566
that looks at you the
way Tyler looks at beer.

23:24.836 --> 23:26.436
Seriously #RelationshipGoals.

23:31.710 --> 23:33.309
You know, you guys
should just go catch up

23:33.311 --> 23:34.577
in the living room.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.446
Michelle and I will keep
an eye on the turkey.

23:36.448 --> 23:39.115
Yeah, you sure?

23:39.117 --> 23:42.085
We got like 20 more minutes on
the turkey

23:42.087 --> 23:44.154
so just take it out pretty soon,
okay?

23:44.156 --> 23:45.188
Don't screw it up.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.856
Yeah, yeah, don't worry about
it.

23:46.858 --> 23:47.991
We got it, okay.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.926
You guys just go have fun.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.628
We got this right?

23:51.630 --> 23:53.997
Yeah, Kate's right.

23:53.999 --> 23:55.165
You should go catch up.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.032
Thanks babe.

23:57.402 --> 23:58.668
Kate, will you just put
buffalo dip in the fridge

23:58.670 --> 24:00.336
so it doesn't get all room
temperatury?

24:00.338 --> 24:02.338
Yeah, I'll just heat
it up before dinner.

24:02.340 --> 24:03.807
Sound good?

24:03.809 --> 24:04.808
Sounds good to me.

24:04.810 --> 24:05.642
Alright, let's go.

24:05.644 --> 24:09.546
Babe, Kisses?

24:15.720 --> 24:16.686
I love you.

24:18.323 --> 24:19.522
Love you too.

24:20.492 --> 24:21.558
What?

24:21.560 --> 24:22.859
That's the living
room?

24:24.396 --> 24:25.728
So you want something to
drink?

24:25.730 --> 24:26.629
We got wine.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.199
Yeah, I could use a glass.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.203
Oh hey dude here,

24:33.205 --> 24:35.972
you need some chapstick 'cause
your lips look a little dry

24:35.974 --> 24:36.973
from the kisses.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.074
Okay very funny, very funny.

24:38.076 --> 24:39.175
Here, hold that, I'll be right
back.

24:39.177 --> 24:41.177
I just gotta grab something real
quick.

24:55.093 --> 24:58.228
So, how's it feel to be out?

24:58.230 --> 24:59.896
It's gotta be pretty good right?

25:00.799 --> 25:02.031
Yeah, it's good.

25:02.968 --> 25:04.234
It's a little weird too.

25:08.473 --> 25:10.607
Weird, like how?

25:12.310 --> 25:15.712
Weird in the sense that
I'm not there anymore.

25:18.683 --> 25:20.517
I was in that cell for so long,

25:22.487 --> 25:23.786
I just don't think it's really
sunk in yet

25:23.788 --> 25:25.188
that I'm out for good.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.692
Yeah, I guess that
could be kind of weird.

25:40.572 --> 25:43.540
So have thought about like
what you wanna do for work?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.275
I'm gonna freelance for a
little bit.

25:46.811 --> 25:48.378
I think it's gonna be pretty
hard for me

25:48.380 --> 25:52.315
to get a traditional nine to
five given the felony charge,

25:52.317 --> 25:54.751
but I got a plan.

25:57.322 --> 25:59.222
Look at what I got.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.823
No, no, no there's no way.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.458
Yes way, yes way man.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.427
I had to for this special
occasion.

26:04.429 --> 26:06.262
Man, I haven't had
this stuff since college.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.430
I know right?

26:07.432 --> 26:09.165
That used to get us in a lot
of trouble

26:10.669 --> 26:12.001
but I'm gonna have to pass man.

26:12.003 --> 26:13.670
What pass?

26:13.672 --> 26:15.138
You just got out of jail man,

26:15.140 --> 26:17.941
we should be drinking like
prohibition just got lifted.

26:17.943 --> 26:19.442
Seriously Tyler, I've
been waiting six years

26:19.444 --> 26:20.910
to party with you.

26:20.912 --> 26:24.614
Michelle is my DD for the
night, I can actually drink.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.317
I haven't drank in six years.

26:27.319 --> 26:30.587
I mean, my tolerance is
nonexistent.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.523
Ooh, well it looks like you
only need one shot then huh?

26:34.359 --> 26:36.759
Come on, come on, one shot.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.361
Okay, only one.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.762
One swig?

26:39.764 --> 26:40.830
You used to drink a whole bottle

26:40.832 --> 26:42.498
of that stuff before we'd go
out.

26:48.873 --> 26:49.706
- There it is.
- I don't know

26:49.708 --> 26:50.540
how I used to drink that.

26:50.542 --> 26:51.541
It burns good.

26:53.979 --> 26:56.179
So, Michelle seems nice.

26:57.382 --> 26:58.948
- She is.
- She isn't.

27:01.653 --> 27:03.519
Dude, she's not that bad come
on.

27:03.521 --> 27:06.189
Maybe not to you, but
you would know best given

27:06.191 --> 27:09.359
that you spend every
waking moment with her.

27:09.361 --> 27:11.194
Yeah, because I live with her.

27:12.430 --> 27:13.730
Besides, what do you
know about relationships?

27:13.732 --> 27:15.999
When was the last time you were
in one?

27:16.001 --> 27:19.869
I know that you're in too
deep that's what I know.

27:19.871 --> 27:22.705
Dude, don't laugh at
him, he's not funny okay.

27:22.707 --> 27:26.376
It's pretty fucking funny
from over here, kissy kisses.

27:27.345 --> 27:29.412
Pete, if she was able to tame
you,

27:29.414 --> 27:30.546
she must be special.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.982
Exactly, she is.

27:34.252 --> 27:35.151
I think?

27:36.621 --> 27:38.721
I mean she's cool, right?

27:38.723 --> 27:42.091
She's smart, she's hot.

27:42.093 --> 27:43.559
Manipulative.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.194
She's the reason I got my job.

27:45.997 --> 27:46.996
Well, how'd you do that?

27:46.998 --> 27:48.364
Yeah, how'd you do that?

27:50.435 --> 27:52.335
Her dad's my boss.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.737
You slept with the boss's
daughter.

27:54.739 --> 27:55.872
He wasn't my boss at the time.

27:55.874 --> 27:56.906
It wasn't like that.

27:56.908 --> 27:57.940
I don't understand.

27:57.942 --> 27:58.775
What does that mean?

27:58.777 --> 28:00.109
It's a whole thing.

28:00.111 --> 28:01.210
Okay, I think you just gonna
have

28:01.212 --> 28:03.713
to tell him the story Pete, come
on man.

28:03.715 --> 28:04.881
I really don't want to.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.282
You always make me tell it.

28:06.284 --> 28:08.051
Come on man, tell the story.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.585
You tell it way better than I
do.

28:09.587 --> 28:11.054
I mean you lived it.

28:11.056 --> 28:11.921
Look, you don't have to if
you don't want to alright.

28:11.923 --> 28:13.389
No, no, no, he has to tell it.

28:13.391 --> 28:15.558
It is fucking hilarious, I
die every time he tells it.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.426
Come on man please.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.427
Why don't you tell it Justin?

28:17.429 --> 28:18.361
Can you tell it please,
please?

28:18.363 --> 28:19.228
Can you tell it Justin?

28:19.230 --> 28:20.430
No, because I can't tell it.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.031
Okay, okay, give me this
bottle Jesus Christ.

28:22.033 --> 28:24.567
- Go ahead.
- Give me a second.

28:26.805 --> 28:27.937
Get this away from me.

28:30.809 --> 28:34.210
So, it all started 19 months
ago.

28:34.212 --> 28:35.745
You know how I know that?

28:35.747 --> 28:36.913
Because Michelle likes

28:36.915 --> 28:40.083
to celebrate our anniversary
every month.

28:40.085 --> 28:40.950
She's cray cray.

28:42.487 --> 28:46.222
Anyways, so one day I go to
the bank to get my taxes done

28:46.224 --> 28:48.591
and place is about to close,

28:48.593 --> 28:49.959
but the receptionist tells me
one

28:49.961 --> 28:52.061
of the accountants can squeeze
me in.

28:52.063 --> 28:55.131
So he walks me down the
hall to Michelle's office

28:56.768 --> 29:01.571
and there she was putting
on this tight dress

29:01.573 --> 29:03.506
and these cute glasses.

29:04.375 --> 29:06.109
I mean totally not what
you'd expect an account

29:06.111 --> 29:07.143
to look like, right?

29:08.446 --> 29:10.313
So we started going through my
taxes

29:10.315 --> 29:12.482
and she is writing everything
off.

29:12.484 --> 29:14.617
I mean, I'm making a killing.

29:14.619 --> 29:16.018
All the while,

29:16.020 --> 29:17.954
she's asking me all these
really personal questions,

29:17.956 --> 29:19.155
flirting with me, right.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.823
Like, am I dependent?

29:20.825 --> 29:23.126
Or am I single?

29:23.128 --> 29:24.794
Don't they have to ask
you if you're single,

29:24.796 --> 29:26.295
when they're filing your taxes?

29:27.532 --> 29:29.098
Well yeah, technically

29:29.100 --> 29:31.501
but it was more like the
way she was saying it.

29:34.139 --> 29:36.873
So we get through with
my taxes and she asked

29:36.875 --> 29:39.442
if I wanna go get some drinks?

29:39.444 --> 29:41.944
Now, I was going through
a bit of a dry spell

29:41.946 --> 29:45.548
and she was super hot
so of course I said yes.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.783
Next thing you know,

29:46.785 --> 29:48.351
we're at this little
Mexican joint near house

29:48.353 --> 29:51.821
and we are throwing back
margaritas and tequila shots.

29:51.823 --> 29:52.955
I mean, we were both hammered

29:52.957 --> 29:55.124
before the appetizers even got
there.

29:55.126 --> 29:57.627
There's no way I'm gonna drive
home.

29:57.629 --> 30:00.363
So, she invited me back to her
place

30:00.365 --> 30:03.733
which we went to, which was
amazing.

30:03.735 --> 30:06.135
I mean this girl lives in
a two bedroom penthouse,

30:06.137 --> 30:08.838
completely decked out all
by herself, two bedrooms.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.574
Yeah, yeah, tell him what
the second bedroom is for.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.310
Alright, so we have
a couple more drinks,

30:14.312 --> 30:15.878
start making out on the couch.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.648
And then she asked me
to go to her bedroom.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.018
The only thing is we don't go to
her room.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.687
We go to the other room, the
second room.

30:25.523 --> 30:28.724
She opens the door and there are
whips,

30:28.726 --> 30:32.428
chains, bonded stuff and
like a sex swing hanging

30:32.430 --> 30:33.896
from the ceiling.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.364
I mean, she had everything,

30:35.366 --> 30:37.934
every toy you can imagine
except for like a sex doll.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.769
He was the sex that she
needed.

30:41.439 --> 30:43.539
Pete, that doesn't sound so
bad man.

30:43.541 --> 30:45.007
Not at all.

30:45.009 --> 30:49.545
I mean, we start going at it
and we're at it for hours.

30:49.547 --> 30:52.248
She's tying me down, I'm tying
her down,

30:52.250 --> 30:54.851
our bodies are contorting.

30:54.853 --> 30:55.918
It was exhausting.

30:57.155 --> 30:58.888
She starfish'd you bro.

30:58.890 --> 31:00.523
- No she did not
- Yes she did!

31:00.525 --> 31:03.059
I Starfish'd her too if
anything.

31:03.061 --> 31:03.893
But you didn't.

31:03.895 --> 31:05.027
Dude she starfish'd you!

31:05.029 --> 31:06.229
It was mutual.

31:06.231 --> 31:07.430
You can't
do no double starfish.

31:07.432 --> 31:08.798
It was a mutual double
starfish situation.

31:08.800 --> 31:09.866
What's a starfish?

31:11.803 --> 31:13.569
So, it's basically when two
people

31:13.571 --> 31:15.471
they have wow sex right?

31:15.473 --> 31:18.307
But usually one person is more
experienced than the other,

31:18.309 --> 31:19.141
in this case.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.143
And then someone is done,

31:21.145 --> 31:23.112
the other is just completely
exhausted,

31:23.114 --> 31:27.083
passed out just lying on
the floor like a starfish.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.051
You ever seen a girl like this
before?

31:30.688 --> 31:32.221
- No.
- You aint never seen it?

31:32.223 --> 31:34.390
- One eye open like this?
- No.

31:35.159 --> 31:37.059
Don't worry, it'll happen to you
man.

31:37.061 --> 31:38.728
Continue with the story bro.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.629
What happened next?

31:39.631 --> 31:41.731
So, this goes on for weeks.

31:42.934 --> 31:45.067
I'm going to her place every
other night.

31:45.069 --> 31:46.736
And then her parents got
involved

31:46.738 --> 31:49.438
and that's when things started
spiraling out of control.

31:50.208 --> 31:53.242
Parents, you are a
savage.

31:54.178 --> 31:57.013
Dude, I didn't sleep
with them, I met them.

31:57.015 --> 31:58.314
Oh I get that.

31:59.517 --> 32:01.918
They invited me to dinner.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.687
We went to this super
nice steak restaurant.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.158
Then a few days later, my car
breaks down.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.327
Her dad meets me at the
dealership

32:11.329 --> 32:15.131
and drops eight G's on a down
payment on a new car for me.

32:15.133 --> 32:17.700
Eight G's, and I barely even
know the guy.

32:17.702 --> 32:22.271
So, few months go by
and my lease runs out.

32:23.141 --> 32:24.473
I didn't have anywhere to go

32:24.475 --> 32:25.641
and Michelle was all,

32:25.643 --> 32:27.510
"You can stay with me, I have
the room."

32:29.047 --> 32:32.715
And then her dad offers me a
job.

32:33.718 --> 32:34.817
What was I gonna do?

32:34.819 --> 32:36.152
Tell him no?

32:36.154 --> 32:37.520
I mean, I'm living with his
daughter

32:37.522 --> 32:38.988
and he just bought me a car.

32:40.558 --> 32:43.025
So, now I'm trapped.

32:46.230 --> 32:47.897
Well, not trapped.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.498
I mean I still love
Michelle and everything.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.202
It's just complicated.

32:58.743 --> 33:01.143
Well, do you like your job at
least?

33:01.145 --> 33:06.182
Not really, but I am making
85K a year so there's that.

33:06.517 --> 33:09.752
So, let me just to recap the
whole thing

33:09.754 --> 33:12.755
Basically Michelle's dad
bought you for 85K a year

33:12.757 --> 33:15.825
and Michelle turns you into her
sex slave.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.493
- #Hooker.
- All right dude, chill okay.

33:17.495 --> 33:20.496
At least I'm getting laid
on the reg unlike you.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.031
Oh Okay, wow dude.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.767
Congratulations, you get to
have sex with your girlfriend

33:24.769 --> 33:25.768
that is awesome.

33:25.770 --> 33:26.869
It is awesome.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.371
Yeah, it is sick.

33:28.373 --> 33:29.238
Hello?

33:30.108 --> 33:31.907
Yeah, yeah okay, I'll help you.

33:31.909 --> 33:32.942
Alright, one second, bye.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.710
That's Alison, she's outside.

33:34.712 --> 33:35.878
I'll be right back.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.847
Sorry you couldn't keep
talking to us.

33:44.489 --> 33:45.721
Sorry about that man.

33:45.723 --> 33:48.424
He always makes me tell
that stupid story.

33:48.426 --> 33:49.458
Today should be about you.

33:49.460 --> 33:51.293
No, it's okay man.

33:51.295 --> 33:53.262
I just wanna hear what
you guys have been up to.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.765
I'm sure it's a lot more
interesting than prison.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.133
Oh, hold that thought.

33:57.135 --> 33:59.101
Sorry I have to take this.

33:59.103 --> 34:00.536
Hi, this is Peter.

34:01.706 --> 34:06.142
Yeah, of course you know
it's me, you called me.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.780
I thought that was gonna be due
on Monday.

34:11.649 --> 34:12.648
You mean her dad.

34:15.018 --> 34:17.386
Oh yeah, Michelle and I are
actually out

34:17.388 --> 34:18.721
to dinner with friends.

34:18.723 --> 34:22.757
Is there any way I can put
this off until tomorrow?

34:25.929 --> 34:26.829
Need any help?

34:29.100 --> 34:30.800
Where's Peter?

34:30.802 --> 34:31.833
He's still in the living room.

34:31.835 --> 34:33.335
I think he's talking to your
dad.

34:33.337 --> 34:34.503
Oh, my God.

34:41.245 --> 34:44.679
Oh, poor Peter always
getting whipped around.

34:44.681 --> 34:46.415
Yeah he seems pretty tied
down.

34:47.284 --> 34:51.087
Oh, so you heard about
the starfish story?

34:51.089 --> 34:54.523
Oh yeah.

34:56.226 --> 34:57.693
Oh my God, Tyler.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.799
Oh my God, it's so good to see
you.

35:03.801 --> 35:04.667
I'm so glad you came.

35:04.669 --> 35:05.968
Are you kidding me?

35:05.970 --> 35:07.703
I wouldn't miss this for the
world.

35:09.707 --> 35:11.674
Sweet potato's coming
in hot.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.310
I'm sorry Justin.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.447
Yeah, it's fine.

35:19.217 --> 35:20.950
Thank you for bringing it.

35:20.952 --> 35:22.551
Mommy who's that?

35:24.555 --> 35:26.956
- Ally, is this?
- My Selena, yup.

35:31.262 --> 35:32.528
Okay, the turkey.

35:33.498 --> 35:35.364
Relax, I turned off the oven.

35:36.667 --> 35:38.067
Thank you Black Jesus.

35:38.069 --> 35:41.170
Selena, this is who mommy
was telling you about.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.338
This is Tyler.

35:42.340 --> 35:44.340
Hi Selena, it's really nice to
meet you.

35:45.776 --> 35:48.911
He doesn't look like the
people in prison on TV.

35:50.114 --> 35:55.184
Selena, that is not a nice
thing to say, apologize.

35:55.419 --> 35:56.886
No, no, no, it's all good.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.990
I'm sorry Tyler.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.224
I forgive you.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.759
I'm glad you came to my party.

36:07.798 --> 36:09.732
I swear, they taste
better than they look.

36:09.734 --> 36:12.268
I'm sure they're as sweet as
you are.

36:12.270 --> 36:16.772
Haha, but in my defense I
wasn't a bit of a rush today

36:16.774 --> 36:20.409
between cooking for this,
Selena's dance practice,

36:20.411 --> 36:22.711
my OBGYN appointment.

36:22.713 --> 36:26.182
It has been quite the
day and I need a drink.

36:27.118 --> 36:28.450
Bottle opener?

36:28.452 --> 36:30.953
Please, you know I never
leave home without one.

36:32.390 --> 36:34.924
Okay, all we need is
Zachary.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.193
What about Peter and the
wench?

36:37.195 --> 36:40.095
- Allison!
- They are right here.

36:40.097 --> 36:41.297
Oh whatever.

36:42.833 --> 36:46.735
Okay, I guess I'll go ahead
and set the table real quick.

36:46.737 --> 36:47.937
You wanna give me a hand bro?

36:47.939 --> 36:49.271
Yeah, sure.

36:57.215 --> 37:01.984
Tyler is kinda little leaner
now, looking like a snack.

37:03.387 --> 37:05.721
Yeah, he definitely got in
better shape.

37:07.058 --> 37:09.558
Maybe you can date him mommy?

37:10.761 --> 37:12.628
Mommy might have to sweetie.

37:14.165 --> 37:15.764
Mommy might have to.

37:21.839 --> 37:23.906
Allison man, holy shit.

37:23.908 --> 37:24.974
I know right?

37:24.976 --> 37:27.309
She became a mom and got hotter.

37:27.311 --> 37:28.310
Not like Hillary Duff.

37:28.312 --> 37:29.979
No, not that man, her
daughter.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.414
What is she like five or six?

37:32.416 --> 37:34.750
Well, she had Selena in
college.

37:36.187 --> 37:37.519
What, you expected her to never
grow up?

37:37.521 --> 37:40.322
No, I know that but
it's just of kind of crazy

37:40.324 --> 37:42.458
to think that one of us has a
kid.

37:42.460 --> 37:44.026
I mean a baby is one thing

37:44.028 --> 37:46.629
but Selena's is like a full on
person.

37:48.399 --> 37:50.332
I mean good for Allison.

37:50.334 --> 37:54.370
But, I don't know, I
guess I missed a lot man.

37:57.775 --> 38:00.209
- I'm sorry man.
- For what?

38:00.211 --> 38:04.046
This, everybody coming over
here, there's the Share Pad.

38:04.048 --> 38:04.947
It's a lot.

38:07.985 --> 38:10.653
Look, Pete only visited
me once in prison.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.389
Yeah, maybe he felt guilty or
something.

38:14.225 --> 38:15.858
And Alison visited me twice

38:15.860 --> 38:18.661
and Kate stopped when she was
dating Zach.

38:18.663 --> 38:19.828
But you know, it's just,

38:19.830 --> 38:21.297
they're acting like nothing ever
happened.

38:23.234 --> 38:28.304
Got it.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.472
I just don't understand.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.007
What were they thinking?

38:32.009 --> 38:35.210
We'll throw Tyler this big
party and he'll just forget

38:35.212 --> 38:38.247
that we neglected him
for six fucking years.

38:38.249 --> 38:40.349
It was originally supposed
to just be me and Kate tonight

38:40.351 --> 38:43.085
but yeah, she wanted to surprise
you

38:43.087 --> 38:44.386
and do something special.

38:45.623 --> 38:47.990
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:47.992 --> 38:51.827
So she should get someone
to blame too, not just me.

38:51.829 --> 38:53.162
I don't blame you guys man.

38:53.164 --> 38:54.830
You have good intentions.

38:57.702 --> 39:00.002
No it's one night, I'll survive.

39:05.309 --> 39:06.208
You sure?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.248
All you can do is try.

39:16.120 --> 39:19.288
We will, I just wanna keep
it between us right now.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.058
But we gotta tell someone
eventually.

39:23.060 --> 39:24.360
Okay, just not tonight.

39:25.129 --> 39:27.529
How about the end of the month
deal?

39:29.400 --> 39:30.299
Deal.

39:40.411 --> 39:41.276
The table's set.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.244
Jesus, Justin.

39:44.181 --> 39:45.781
Oh, here we go.

39:45.783 --> 39:47.549
This must be the man of the
hour?

39:48.686 --> 39:49.718
I guess so.

39:49.720 --> 39:50.786
And you must be Zack.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.955
I prefer Zachary, but yes.

39:52.957 --> 39:53.922
Nice to meet you man.

39:53.924 --> 39:56.258
Wow, that's quite a grip.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.428
You've been working out
at the school yard, damn?

39:59.430 --> 40:02.898
No, there was no school
yard or anything like that.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.401
Just push ups and prison food I
guess.

40:05.403 --> 40:07.069
Well keep it up man.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.270
You're doing great.

40:08.272 --> 40:09.638
Me, I just worked out three
times a week,

40:09.640 --> 40:11.974
but I went vegan.

40:11.976 --> 40:13.642
It's been working wonders for
me.

40:14.445 --> 40:17.479
Nice, yeah I'll have
to try that sometime.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.816
Tyler, you just ate two
double cheeseburgers for lunch.

40:20.818 --> 40:23.352
It might be a little
tough to go vegan my man.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.789
Well, it's not for everyone.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.357
Two, good Lord Ty?

40:28.359 --> 40:29.258
It was my first meal after
prison.

40:29.260 --> 40:30.526
Can you cut me some slack?

40:30.528 --> 40:32.628
Okay, so does anyone want
refills?

40:32.630 --> 40:33.495
Another brew?

40:34.732 --> 40:37.032
Oh Zachary, you got
another batch of homemade?

40:37.034 --> 40:38.300
Oh, I sure do.

40:38.302 --> 40:39.868
This is a new lager I've been
working on,

40:39.870 --> 40:41.270
haven't quite figured out a name
for it,

40:41.272 --> 40:42.304
but you wanna try one?

40:42.306 --> 40:43.972
- Yeah, sure.
- All right.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.474
Tyler, how about you brother?

40:46.710 --> 40:47.609
I'm alright.

40:47.611 --> 40:49.144
Oh, come on you gotta try one.

40:49.914 --> 40:52.948
No, I think I'm gonna
stick to the light beer.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.317
Well it's a lager, it can't
get much lighter than this.

40:55.319 --> 40:56.819
Just have a sip.

40:56.821 --> 40:57.653
Come on man.

40:57.655 --> 40:58.720
Just try it.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.622
He won't stop bugging you til
you do.

41:00.624 --> 41:01.857
Well, I will if you will?

41:02.793 --> 41:04.493
No, I don't really like beer.

41:05.463 --> 41:06.728
Since when?

41:06.730 --> 41:08.897
We used to drink them
all the time in college.

41:08.899 --> 41:11.300
Yeah, because that's
all we could afford.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.669
I've never actually
really liked the taste.

41:13.671 --> 41:15.571
You know I have been
trying to put her on beer

41:15.573 --> 41:18.507
for two years now but every
time I pick up a new brew,

41:18.509 --> 41:19.875
she just shoots it down.

41:22.580 --> 41:23.812
It would be waste on her.

41:25.449 --> 41:28.217
So, how does this new batch
compare

41:28.219 --> 41:29.318
to the ones you brought

41:29.320 --> 41:31.353
to Michelle's beach house last
summer?

41:31.355 --> 41:34.756
No comparison whatsoever,
worlds better.

41:34.758 --> 41:37.926
All right, cheers.

41:37.928 --> 41:38.894
Cheers.

41:38.896 --> 41:40.195
To getting out of jail.

41:43.934 --> 41:46.068
To getting out of jail.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.513
Okay, yeah, it's pretty good
man.

41:59.450 --> 42:03.252
Yeah, jail break.

42:05.289 --> 42:07.422
Excuse me?

42:07.424 --> 42:09.391
It's the name of the
beer, a jailbreak lager.

42:09.393 --> 42:10.692
It's a great name for it.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.229
What?

42:15.132 --> 42:16.131
You know what.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.399
No I don't.

42:17.401 --> 42:21.203
The name bro, it's just
a little insensitive.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.070
Oh, come on.

42:23.240 --> 42:25.240
Tyler I'm sorry, I
didn't mean it like that.

42:25.242 --> 42:26.441
No it's cool man, don't worry
about it.

42:26.443 --> 42:28.277
Okay but I don't wanna
hurt your feelings.

42:28.279 --> 42:30.312
No I know you didn't, it's
fine.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.883
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

42:38.923 --> 42:39.988
What?

42:39.990 --> 42:43.125
Go apologize and actually mean
it.

42:43.127 --> 42:45.093
- Okay fine, fine.
- Go.

42:49.900 --> 42:51.633
Are you sure you guys
don't need any help?

42:51.635 --> 42:53.602
We'll be fine, we got
it.

42:55.005 --> 42:56.338
I could peel some more
potatoes.

42:56.340 --> 42:57.673
I already peeled them all.

42:57.675 --> 42:58.774
I can help set the table.

42:58.776 --> 43:00.342
I already told you we set it.

43:02.780 --> 43:04.346
All right, fine.

43:16.560 --> 43:18.994
So you really gonna marry
that?

43:36.080 --> 43:37.179
He's a tool.

43:40.784 --> 43:41.883
You can get her back.

43:48.792 --> 43:51.893
Whoa, sorry I didn't
know anyone was waiting..

43:51.895 --> 43:55.297
I wasn't, I want to
apologize for what I said

43:55.299 --> 43:56.164
in the kitchen.

43:57.234 --> 43:59.134
It's all good, don't worry
about it.

43:59.136 --> 44:04.139
I know, but I feel bad and
I'd hate for us to start off

44:04.441 --> 44:05.407
on the wrong foot.

44:06.310 --> 44:07.643
I wanna apologize.

44:07.645 --> 44:11.179
Well, you already
apologized and it's okay.

44:12.016 --> 44:14.883
Just come on outside
with me real quick, right?

44:15.653 --> 44:17.052
It will just take a second.

44:18.422 --> 44:21.256
- All right, sure.
- Great, come on.

44:37.941 --> 44:39.841
It's so beautiful out.

44:46.884 --> 44:48.216
Is that weed?

44:49.520 --> 44:50.419
It sure is.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.889
You know they made marijuana
recreational

44:53.891 --> 44:57.125
when you were in jail which
in essence decriminalized it.

44:59.563 --> 45:01.763
It sucks they didn't do
that before you got busted.

45:04.835 --> 45:05.734
Yeah.

45:09.239 --> 45:09.805
You want some?

45:13.377 --> 45:15.644
No, no I'm good thank you.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.313
Let me know if you change your
mind.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.490
So, how's it feel man?

45:29.860 --> 45:30.792
How's what feel?

45:32.196 --> 45:33.462
Getting out of prison?

45:35.566 --> 45:37.599
You know 'cause Kate told me

45:37.601 --> 45:39.968
that you took the fall for all
those guys.

45:40.838 --> 45:42.104
So, let me get this straight?

45:42.106 --> 45:45.173
You stockpile 20 pounds
of weed for that party?

45:47.010 --> 45:48.009
Yeah, about that.

45:49.046 --> 45:50.612
What the idea was to take the
weed,

45:50.614 --> 45:52.280
put in some barrels and
then we were going to just-

45:52.282 --> 45:54.783
- And hotbox the whole house.

45:54.785 --> 45:56.017
Dude, that's so cool.

45:58.021 --> 45:59.321
Sucks you got busted.

46:02.059 --> 46:04.960
Yeah, it really sucked.

46:08.532 --> 46:12.501
But you know, it could happen
anyone.

46:12.503 --> 46:13.935
It was an accident.

46:13.937 --> 46:16.371
But it happened to you, of
course.

46:21.245 --> 46:23.111
Freaking Peter man,

46:23.113 --> 46:25.680
making you take the fall for all
of this.

46:25.682 --> 46:28.450
Can't believe you're still
friends with the guy.

46:28.452 --> 46:29.885
Wasn't it his idea in the first
place

46:29.887 --> 46:31.653
to get all the weed for the
party?

46:32.422 --> 46:33.321
Yeah, it was.

46:35.893 --> 46:37.159
If he would've done that to
me,

46:37.161 --> 46:39.027
I'd never talked to that dude
again.

46:39.897 --> 46:43.398
But you know, I guess you're
a better man than I am.

46:46.670 --> 46:48.370
I'm a nice guy, what can I
say?

46:49.273 --> 46:51.540
That's the understatement
of the century my guy.

46:56.146 --> 46:58.246
Listen man, I just don't want
things

46:58.248 --> 47:00.482
to be weird between us.

47:02.586 --> 47:03.518
Why would things be weird?

47:03.520 --> 47:04.386
I just met you.

47:07.024 --> 47:10.158
Because of Kate, you guys used
to date,

47:10.160 --> 47:12.194
she's my girlfriend.

47:14.832 --> 47:17.165
Well you mean fiance though?

47:17.167 --> 47:18.233
She told you?

47:20.671 --> 47:22.070
No, she didn't tell me
anything.

47:23.507 --> 47:24.439
I saw the ring.

47:27.711 --> 47:29.211
You saw the ring?

47:29.213 --> 47:30.412
It's pretty nice isn't it?

47:30.414 --> 47:32.214
Picked it out myself.

47:32.216 --> 47:33.415
Yeah, it's very nice.

47:36.053 --> 47:37.185
You see, she kind of wanted to
keep it

47:37.187 --> 47:39.421
on the DL, this whole
engagement.

47:39.423 --> 47:41.556
Keep it our little secret.

47:41.558 --> 47:42.691
Me on the other hand,

47:42.693 --> 47:44.092
I just wanna shout out this
engagement

47:44.094 --> 47:45.060
on top of the mountain.

47:45.062 --> 47:47.062
Like yo, that's my wife!

47:47.064 --> 47:48.730
I am hitting that man.

47:51.201 --> 47:52.734
Relax man, lighten up.

47:53.503 --> 47:55.737
Just joking I'm not that awful.

48:03.847 --> 48:05.747
Zach, I just really care about
Kate

48:07.217 --> 48:09.217
so I just wanna make
sure that she's happy.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.239
Yeah, so do I.

48:15.241 --> 48:16.257
Why do you think I'm marrying
her, huh?

48:19.363 --> 48:20.729
Yeah.

48:20.731 --> 48:22.731
You know what, that makes a lot
of sense.

48:26.069 --> 48:29.771
Tyler I know I'm probably
not your favorite person

48:29.773 --> 48:33.008
in the world, but I make Kate
happy.

48:34.344 --> 48:36.912
And I know that may not make you
happy

48:36.914 --> 48:39.114
but you're just gonna
have to deal with it.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.258
How about we go back inside and
be social?

48:51.028 --> 48:52.160
It's a party isn't it?

48:53.630 --> 48:54.629
Come on, let's go.

49:14.151 --> 49:15.884
Jesus Kate, you weigh like 90
pounds,

49:15.886 --> 49:17.352
how do you take up so much
space?

49:17.354 --> 49:19.888
I'm standing still, you're
the one who keeps moving.

49:33.603 --> 49:36.171
Oh, that look good don't it?

49:37.307 --> 49:38.673
- Yeah.
- Better than your turkey

49:38.675 --> 49:40.141
that you brought to school
in the seventh grade

49:40.143 --> 49:41.576
and made everybody poo poo.

49:41.578 --> 49:43.078
Yeah, it don't even get close to
this.

49:43.080 --> 49:45.213
Mine is perfect that's
why you on the potatoes,

49:45.215 --> 49:46.147
stick with them.

49:47.284 --> 49:49.084
You sure you guys
don't need any help it?

49:49.086 --> 49:50.518
Oh yeah, we're fine.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.320
Hey Zachary, you should go
say hi to Alison and Peter

49:52.322 --> 49:53.588
in the living room.

49:53.590 --> 49:55.423
Okay, all right.

49:55.425 --> 49:56.825
Hey Tyler, you wanna go?

49:56.827 --> 49:59.561
I don't wanna interrupt
their magic in here.

50:02.632 --> 50:03.598
Do I have to go with that guy

50:03.600 --> 50:05.200
because I really don't want to?

50:05.969 --> 50:08.103
Yes and be nice.

50:09.873 --> 50:12.040
For you, I'll try.

50:16.947 --> 50:19.214
I may need a few more
of these first though.

50:22.285 --> 50:26.688
Jailbreak!

50:26.690 --> 50:29.457
It was funny, jailbreak!

50:34.898 --> 50:36.431
Okay, okay my turn.

50:39.903 --> 50:44.973
Never have I ever had a
threesome.

50:45.242 --> 50:46.207
You better not have.

50:46.209 --> 50:49.744
Foursome, but who's counting.

50:49.746 --> 50:51.112
Yeah not you.

50:51.114 --> 50:53.882
- Geez Allison.
- And she wonders

50:53.884 --> 50:55.150
why she's still single.

50:56.486 --> 50:58.987
Oh whatever, none of you all
know

50:58.989 --> 51:01.790
what it's like trying to date
when you're a single mom.

51:03.560 --> 51:06.227
I love my Selena to death

51:06.229 --> 51:09.097
but when guys hear you're a mom,

51:10.167 --> 51:12.834
they just stop talking to me.

51:12.836 --> 51:16.938
Yeah, I'm a mom but I'm hotter
now than I was in college.

51:18.508 --> 51:19.974
This momma needs some loving.

51:20.911 --> 51:21.910
Oh, yes she does!

51:23.346 --> 51:27.182
Tyler, you haven't really
seen me since college.

51:27.184 --> 51:29.084
Don't you think I got hotter?

51:29.086 --> 51:29.951
Excuse me?

51:29.953 --> 51:31.586
Do I think you got hotter?

51:33.090 --> 51:34.422
Would you bang me?

51:34.424 --> 51:36.658
Allison, we're
friends.

51:36.660 --> 51:38.326
Come on, would you bang me?

51:38.328 --> 51:43.031
Ally, okay I guess I would.

51:43.033 --> 51:44.699
Yeah, there we go.

51:44.701 --> 51:45.600
Thank you!

51:47.070 --> 51:49.504
God, it is like pulling
teeth with you guys.

51:50.474 --> 51:53.541
I mean, for what it's
worth Allison, I'd bang you.

51:56.246 --> 51:59.447
I mean, if I was single,
not now obviously.

52:01.418 --> 52:02.650
Thank you Zachary.

52:04.821 --> 52:07.989
Oh whatever, it's not
like you weren't hoeing

52:07.991 --> 52:09.023
around in college.

52:11.161 --> 52:14.062
Excuse me, would you like
to elaborate on that Peter?

52:14.064 --> 52:16.197
Yeah Peter, would you?

52:16.199 --> 52:18.733
I would but tonight is not
about me.

52:18.735 --> 52:22.704
Tyler, why don't you
tell us about prison man?

52:22.706 --> 52:25.507
What was the craziest
thing that happened to you?

52:25.509 --> 52:29.410
Yeah, was there like some
prison riots and stuff?

52:29.412 --> 52:32.080
No, no I was in a
minimum security prison.

52:32.949 --> 52:34.048
Yeah, but it had to be cooler

52:34.050 --> 52:35.884
than anything we were doing out
here.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.353
I mean, did you ever like
get in a lunch room brawl

52:38.355 --> 52:40.388
or like learn how to
make a shiv or something?

52:40.390 --> 52:41.556
Pete, it wasn't cool.

52:42.659 --> 52:43.558
It was prison.

52:44.995 --> 52:49.564
I did the same thing every
day for six years, it sucked.

52:52.836 --> 52:54.102
And if it's all right,

52:54.104 --> 52:55.904
I'd rather not talk about it
right now.

52:59.442 --> 53:00.708
Of course it is.

53:02.212 --> 53:03.778
Yeah, sorry man.

53:03.780 --> 53:04.879
No, it's all right.

53:07.050 --> 53:08.750
It's just a little fresh I
guess.

53:13.857 --> 53:17.358
So Tyler, have you thought
about what you might wanna do

53:17.360 --> 53:18.226
for work here?

53:20.797 --> 53:23.464
I think I'm gonna start just
doing some freelance work.

53:23.466 --> 53:25.466
I think it's gonna be a little
hard for a company to hire me

53:25.468 --> 53:27.769
with a felony charge and also.

53:27.771 --> 53:29.571
Tyler, what was your major?

53:29.573 --> 53:31.372
Graphic design.

53:31.374 --> 53:34.142
Well, I can ask my dad if
he has any need for designers

53:34.144 --> 53:35.610
in his company.

53:35.612 --> 53:36.778
I know you're a nice guy,

53:36.780 --> 53:40.215
Peter told me everything that
happened.

53:40.217 --> 53:41.082
Did he now?

53:42.419 --> 53:46.120
Yeah Michelle, I don't
think that's such a good idea.

53:46.122 --> 53:47.322
I read the HR manual

53:47.324 --> 53:49.123
and your dad's company doesn't
hire anyone

53:49.125 --> 53:50.992
with a felony charge.

53:50.994 --> 53:53.595
You read the HR manual Peter?

53:53.597 --> 53:54.596
Yeah, I did.

53:56.166 --> 53:57.432
Nerd!

54:00.770 --> 54:05.139
Well, at least I have
an HR manual to read

54:05.141 --> 54:06.241
'cause I have a job.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.609
- Peter?
- Oh well,

54:07.611 --> 54:09.510
at least I didn't have
to beg my girlfriend

54:11.948 --> 54:12.980
for a job.

54:12.982 --> 54:14.015
It's not begging, it's
called networking you dick.

54:14.017 --> 54:15.750
Oh really?

54:15.752 --> 54:19.320
Well, I didn't know that sleeping
with your boss's daughter

54:19.322 --> 54:21.189
is called networking.

54:21.191 --> 54:22.991
Well in that case, I guess me
and Kate

54:22.993 --> 54:24.792
and her father have to
have a big conversation.

54:24.794 --> 54:25.860
You know what?

54:25.862 --> 54:27.595
You've been such a dick like all
night

54:27.597 --> 54:28.429
to like everybody.

54:28.431 --> 54:29.297
You don't want this bro.

54:29.299 --> 54:30.131
Why are you even here?

54:30.133 --> 54:31.366
You do not want this,

54:31.368 --> 54:33.201
I take two classes of
judo this month okay.

54:33.203 --> 54:35.837
- Okay, that's enough stop.
- He started it!

54:35.839 --> 54:36.838
- It doesn't matter.
- And I would've finished

54:36.840 --> 54:37.839
it too bro, what's up?

54:37.841 --> 54:42.477
Dinner's ready!

54:42.479 --> 54:43.611
A dinner bell?

54:43.613 --> 54:45.046
Really Kate?

54:45.048 --> 54:48.549
Yeah, I saw it online
and it was only seven bucks

54:48.551 --> 54:50.051
so I had to.

54:50.053 --> 54:51.619
All right, is everybody ready?

54:55.425 --> 54:58.059
Yeah, I'm starving actually.

54:58.061 --> 55:01.062
Oh Alison, is Selena gonna
sit with us at the table

55:01.064 --> 55:02.297
or hang out in here?

55:02.299 --> 55:05.066
Oops, no she'll be fine with
her shows.

55:06.102 --> 55:07.368
I'll fix her up a plate.

55:08.271 --> 55:09.370
Okay, great.

55:09.372 --> 55:11.005
All right, I hope everybody's
hungry

55:11.007 --> 55:12.707
'cause we got a lot of food.

55:45.308 --> 55:48.409
All right, one beautiful bird
coming in.

55:51.214 --> 55:54.515
Peter, can you move
the beets to make room?

56:06.463 --> 56:08.396
Does anyone need anything else?

56:09.332 --> 56:10.732
Another drink or?

56:14.070 --> 56:16.204
- Okay then.
- Actually Jay,

56:17.040 --> 56:19.107
can I talk to you for a second?

56:19.109 --> 56:20.475
Yeah, yeah, sure.

56:21.845 --> 56:24.312
- Just real quick?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:29.252 --> 56:30.151
What's up?

56:32.255 --> 56:33.221
Zachary man.

56:34.724 --> 56:35.623
What about him?

56:37.660 --> 56:38.893
He sucks, dude.

56:40.897 --> 56:41.963
Man, you should've heard
the shit he was saying

56:41.965 --> 56:42.930
to me outside.

56:42.932 --> 56:44.265
I know he sucks man

56:44.267 --> 56:46.267
but do you think you might
be overreacting a bit?

56:46.269 --> 56:47.402
You have been drinking.

56:47.404 --> 56:49.504
No I have, but I'm not
overreacting.

56:52.575 --> 56:54.442
Man, we can let Kate marry that
man?

56:56.913 --> 56:59.981
Look, I know you still
have feelings for her.

56:59.983 --> 57:01.783
No, it's not even like that
man.

57:03.219 --> 57:04.318
Okay, maybe there's a little bit

57:04.320 --> 57:07.588
but we can't let her go through
with it.

57:07.590 --> 57:08.489
I mean, we have to say
something.

57:08.491 --> 57:09.991
I've tried man.

57:09.993 --> 57:11.793
I've talked to her and him
when they first started dating,

57:11.795 --> 57:13.628
even with Peter and Michelle.

57:13.630 --> 57:15.596
Don't even get me
started with Peter man.

57:19.235 --> 57:20.768
What happened with those two?

57:23.740 --> 57:26.274
I mean, people just grow up in
a way

57:27.944 --> 57:30.545
and they wanted to settle down,

57:31.614 --> 57:33.281
it's just what people started
doing.

57:34.884 --> 57:35.783
Why didn't you?

57:36.986 --> 57:38.619
'Cause I like hoeing around.

57:38.621 --> 57:41.889
It's fun.

57:42.826 --> 57:45.893
Hey, tomorrow night me and you,

57:45.895 --> 57:47.795
we're gonna go out and
we're gonna find some girls

57:47.797 --> 57:50.231
that haven't settled down
if you know what I'm saying.

57:51.768 --> 57:52.834
You down for that?

57:57.841 --> 57:58.739
Yeah.

57:59.609 --> 58:00.875
All right, good.

58:00.877 --> 58:04.011
Now let's go eat some
turkey, rip some shots,

58:04.013 --> 58:06.013
have some fun all right.

58:06.015 --> 58:07.849
Fuck what they all think down
there.

58:10.787 --> 58:12.253
- You're right.
- All right?

58:12.255 --> 58:13.654
Let's do it, let's have fun.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.594
For the love of God Allison,
just take the damn photo!

58:19.596 --> 58:21.762
Shut up, I'm trying.

58:21.764 --> 58:23.331
- Smile
- Wait I'm trying.

58:24.534 --> 58:26.534
Thank you, it looks great.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.509
Well, it's about time.

58:34.511 --> 58:35.843
We've been waiting.

58:36.813 --> 58:39.747
Okay, how about maybe thank
you

58:39.749 --> 58:42.216
for making the turkey Justin?

58:42.218 --> 58:44.952
- Thanks Justin.
- Thank you Justin.

58:44.954 --> 58:47.288
See, they are grateful now
let's eat.

58:50.994 --> 58:54.128
Hey Justin, I got to say
this whole cooking the turkey,

58:54.130 --> 58:56.063
organizing this whole dinner,

58:56.065 --> 58:57.965
your clothing line, you are
quite

58:57.967 --> 59:01.135
the renaissance man my
friend, congratulations.

59:02.238 --> 59:03.771
Please don't feed his ego.

59:03.773 --> 59:05.740
Seriously, I don't think
he can get any cockier.

59:05.742 --> 59:07.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa, cocky?

59:07.410 --> 59:08.376
No, I'm not cocky man.

59:08.378 --> 59:11.112
I am fucking vindicated.

59:11.114 --> 59:14.882
You know how hard it was to
put this whole thing together?

59:14.884 --> 59:16.651
Yeah, well I think it's great
Jay.

59:16.653 --> 59:17.485
You should be really proud.

59:17.487 --> 59:18.653
Thank you.

59:18.655 --> 59:21.322
I agree, it's really
impressive Justin.

59:21.324 --> 59:24.492
Plus your leggings make my ass
look good

59:24.494 --> 59:27.061
so keep making clothes.

59:27.063 --> 59:29.497
I am grateful to help
you on that Allison.

59:30.934 --> 59:34.802
Well, when you've had as many
failed businesses as Justin,

59:34.804 --> 59:36.804
it's only a matter of time
before one of them takes off.

59:36.806 --> 59:39.674
- Right Jay?
- You damn right.

59:39.676 --> 59:42.143
Self-made, I mean I was over

59:42.145 --> 59:44.178
that whole corporate America
shit.

59:44.180 --> 59:49.116
I mean my last job, ass.

59:49.118 --> 59:54.288
I was making 35K to manage a
client

59:54.290 --> 59:58.192
that was grossing our company
over $3 million a year.

59:58.194 --> 01:00:02.597
Like how does that even make any
sense?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.931
Why even try?

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.967
Because if you don't you'll
get fired.

01:00:06.769 --> 01:00:08.369
No you won't.

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:12.006
My nine to five boss has me
doing like three people's jobs.

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:15.309
If he were to fire me,
he would be so fucked.

01:00:15.311 --> 01:00:19.981
He tried to reprimand me for
my lack of enthusiasm lately.

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.818
It's like, yo bitch why
don't I reprimand you

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:25.386
for my lack of salary?

01:00:28.124 --> 01:00:29.790
Oh, working sucks man.

01:00:30.927 --> 01:00:33.027
I mean, corporate America broke
my spirit.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:37.498
It's like trade in your
soul for 401k in a salary

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:38.899
with good health benefits.

01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:45.006
Oh, I miss college, no
responsibilities, just fun

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.474
that was so great.

01:00:48.077 --> 01:00:51.212
When I was in college, I
couldn't wait to graduate.

01:00:51.214 --> 01:00:53.881
- Yeah, that was dumb.
- Right?

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:57.418
Now it's just go to work, make
money,

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:01.555
pay your bills and just keep
repeating that until you die.

01:01:01.557 --> 01:01:03.691
Yeah, growing up really sucks.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:04.825
Sure it does.

01:01:08.598 --> 01:01:09.830
You know if you hate your jobs
so much,

01:01:09.832 --> 01:01:11.032
why don't you just quit?

01:01:11.868 --> 01:01:12.767
Get a new one.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:15.903
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:20.441
Yeah, I should just quit my
job.

01:01:20.443 --> 01:01:24.111
Me and Selena can become
actors to pay the bills.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:26.113
Oh, I could be your manager.

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.948
Yeah, and I'll call
your dad and be like,

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:29.784
"Hey Mr. Nolan, can you give me
a raise?

01:01:29.786 --> 01:01:32.420
"And also lessen my workload."

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.521
That would go over well.

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.356
I think you guys just need to
find out

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.391
what you wanna do in life.

01:01:37.393 --> 01:01:40.027
I think that's all of
you guys' problem is.

01:01:42.398 --> 01:01:45.866
Yeah, but I wish it was that
easy.

01:01:46.903 --> 01:01:49.236
I just don't know what I want.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.106
Well, I mean I don't know,

01:01:52.108 --> 01:01:53.708
it might be a little corny

01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:56.877
but maybe you can just
start off by making a list,

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:57.912
note everything that you like

01:01:57.914 --> 01:02:00.214
and then pick out the ones

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.782
that you can make money off of.

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.453
Yeah, I guess.

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:10.391
You should, I mean it's what I
did.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:12.793
And I got a pretty good idea
of what I'm gonna do now

01:02:12.795 --> 01:02:14.595
that I'm out so.

01:02:14.597 --> 01:02:18.132
Yeah, but it's tough to
find time to even do that

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:21.936
with work, Selena, friends.

01:02:23.606 --> 01:02:25.773
Yeah and Tyler you also
had a lot more free time

01:02:25.775 --> 01:02:27.842
than all of us to think about
your goals.

01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:33.347
Damn it.

01:02:37.453 --> 01:02:39.353
Are you serious right now?

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:41.255
Oh come on, I was just joking.

01:02:41.257 --> 01:02:43.090
Screw your jokes, you've been
a dick.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.159
- Ty, Ty.
- No, no you've been a dick

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:46.694
- to me all night.
- Tyler?

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:48.696
Come on dude, he didn't mean
it.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:49.997
I was just joking.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:51.832
Yeah, just let it go Ty.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:05.613
Wow, you know what?

01:03:05.615 --> 01:03:08.649
You're right, it was a joke.

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.852
This whole night's been a joke.

01:03:14.957 --> 01:03:19.727
All night, every single one
of you have been complaining.

01:03:19.729 --> 01:03:21.562
You think work sucks?

01:03:21.564 --> 01:03:26.567
Try prison, I sacrificed
72 months of my life.

01:03:27.737 --> 01:03:30.237
I never even had the opportunity
to make the kind of life

01:03:30.239 --> 01:03:32.139
that you guys have been bitching
about.

01:03:35.411 --> 01:03:38.379
Look dude, nobody asked
you to play the martyr.

01:03:38.381 --> 01:03:40.181
Hey Peter, Peter.

01:03:40.183 --> 01:03:41.849
You hear that?

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.350
That I didn't have to play the
martyr?

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:47.054
Peter, how come when the cops
showed up,

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.556
you were nowhere to be found?

01:03:52.595 --> 01:03:56.330
It was your idea to hotbox
the whole house for the party.

01:03:57.667 --> 01:03:58.833
It was also you

01:03:58.835 --> 01:04:00.935
who made sure the cops showed
up.

01:04:00.937 --> 01:04:02.603
Right Jay, right?

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.105
Yeah Ty, yeah.

01:04:05.107 --> 01:04:06.607
Somebody tripped the alarm.

01:04:09.178 --> 01:04:10.845
It was an accident, okay.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.779
I said I was sorry.

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.881
Yeah, if you were sorry,

01:04:13.883 --> 01:04:15.950
you would've shared the blame
with me.

01:04:15.952 --> 01:04:17.885
All of you would have.

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.753
Whoa, hold on.

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:21.355
You said that you would take the
wrap

01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:23.023
so that none of us would
have a felony charge

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:24.191
that would ruin our lives.

01:04:24.193 --> 01:04:25.526
That really doesn't even
matter anyway

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.128
'cause you all ruined your
lives all by yourselves.

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:36.437
All you guys, all three
of you hate your jobs,

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:39.039
hate your lives.

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:43.911
You just complain, complain and
complain.

01:04:43.913 --> 01:04:46.113
At least you had a chance to
make something of your lives.

01:04:46.115 --> 01:04:47.982
You don't have to spend
half a decade locked

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:49.583
in a fucking box.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:56.957
But what did you do with it
though?

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:04.832
All right Tyler, I
think you've had enough

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:06.567
- to drink.
- Fuck you.

01:05:08.571 --> 01:05:09.770
You know they may hate their
jobs

01:05:09.772 --> 01:05:10.938
but at least I have one bud.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.906
Tyler!

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.611
Kate, you should've heard
the shit he was saying outside.

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.613
Come on, we were just messing
around.

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.949
Messing around?

01:05:26.956 --> 01:05:32.026
How unappreciative and
ungrateful can you be?

01:05:42.705 --> 01:05:44.638
Six years for you guys.

01:05:47.777 --> 01:05:48.876
What a fucking waste.

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:16.370
I think
Michelle

01:06:16.372 --> 01:06:18.138
and I should hit the road.

01:06:19.175 --> 01:06:21.742
Great, bail like you always
do.

01:06:24.313 --> 01:06:26.180
Look, let's just go.

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:35.889
Justin, do you have a
trashcan?

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.157
I think I'm gonna vomit.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:44.398
Shit.

01:06:51.807 --> 01:06:54.742
You know no one likes you right?

01:07:37.920 --> 01:07:40.421
I'm not apologizing Jay.

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:43.323
It's Kate, we need to talk.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:03.577
I'm sorry.

01:08:04.680 --> 01:08:05.813
Gee thanks.

01:08:08.350 --> 01:08:13.353
No seriously, I mean it
really should've just been me,

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.156
you and Justin tonight.

01:08:18.961 --> 01:08:20.928
Clearly we did not think this
through.

01:08:23.599 --> 01:08:24.631
Yeah, clearly.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:34.841
Look, I do appreciate the
effort.

01:08:36.745 --> 01:08:40.514
I know you guys are just trying
to do something nice for me.

01:08:43.752 --> 01:08:46.153
Do we get an A for effort at
least?

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:51.457
Yeah, you get an A for effort.

01:08:58.334 --> 01:08:59.899
Look, can I ask you something?

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:03.470
Yeah, of course.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:15.149
Are you just gonna stand there

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:16.850
or do you wanna sit down?

01:09:19.988 --> 01:09:20.888
Yeah, I'll sit.

01:09:31.634 --> 01:09:36.670
Ty, just ask me the question.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.778
What could you possibly see in
Zachary?

01:09:47.616 --> 01:09:48.515
What?

01:09:51.053 --> 01:09:53.120
I mean Kate, you can't marry
that man.

01:09:55.658 --> 01:09:58.058
It's not really your
decision to make Ty.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:00.594
I mean, I love him.

01:10:00.596 --> 01:10:02.462
He's such a pompous asshole.

01:10:04.466 --> 01:10:05.432
You just met him.

01:10:05.434 --> 01:10:06.767
How would you even know?

01:10:07.670 --> 01:10:09.303
The fact that you just said,

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:11.638
"How would you know?",
just proves my point.

01:10:13.142 --> 01:10:14.875
Don't put words in my mouth
Ty.

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:19.713
Okay, why then?

01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:22.082
Why what?

01:10:22.084 --> 01:10:23.250
Why do you love him?

01:10:24.987 --> 01:10:26.653
What do you mean why?

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:30.224
When you love someone, you love
someone.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.992
There doesn't need to be a
reason.

01:10:31.994 --> 01:10:34.895
What do you mean there
doesn't have to be a reason?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.664
I don't know it's just love.

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:42.903
Kate, I get that you
didn't wanna wait for me

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:44.438
to get out of prison but him?

01:10:45.374 --> 01:10:47.574
I mean, you can do a lot better
than that.

01:10:47.576 --> 01:10:50.277
Oh, 'cause you're the
best judge of character?

01:11:07.763 --> 01:11:08.662
I'm sorry.

01:11:14.803 --> 01:11:16.603
I did so much for you guys.

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:29.716
No one forced you to take the
fall Ty.

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:31.451
No one forced me?

01:11:34.256 --> 01:11:38.992
They begged me, begged me
to figure out a situation

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:40.794
so you guys wouldn't get
convicted.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:52.339
Kate, you know what I
did was the only way.

01:11:55.844 --> 01:11:59.980
Allison, Selena, Pete and Jay
knew.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.722
You guys show up here

01:12:08.724 --> 01:12:10.390
and you act like nothing ever
happened.

01:12:10.392 --> 01:12:12.225
I've never heard this much
complaining for

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.493
in my entire life.

01:12:18.967 --> 01:12:22.235
You know what might seem
like a lot compared to you.

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:25.872
I'm not trying to belittle what
you did,

01:12:27.209 --> 01:12:32.245
but growing up and getting
out of college just wasn't

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.451
what we all thought it would be.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:38.352
How so?

01:12:39.955 --> 01:12:42.556
Well, when you get to college,

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:45.625
you get to pick your major
with the expectations

01:12:45.627 --> 01:12:48.462
that you'll get a job
doing what you wanna do

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:50.130
with your major.

01:12:50.132 --> 01:12:52.733
And sometimes it's hard
to find a job in that field,

01:12:52.735 --> 01:12:53.867
I get that.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:58.872
No, it's not hard, it's
impossible.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:03.610
So what happens is someone like
me

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:06.213
who wants to be a photographer,

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.482
ends up having to get a job in
sales

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:11.051
because there are no
photography jobs available.

01:13:11.987 --> 01:13:15.555
So a super creative person
who shouldn't be sitting

01:13:15.557 --> 01:13:20.560
at a desk all day ends up
having to sit at a desk all day.

01:13:21.597 --> 01:13:24.731
And then on top of that,
this job that you're forced

01:13:24.733 --> 01:13:26.900
to take doesn't even pay that
well.

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:30.570
So you're underpaid,
overworked and you're not doing

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:34.674
what makes you happy, it's
awful.

01:13:40.716 --> 01:13:42.783
To make matters even worse,

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:47.454
I still have $40,000 in
student loans to pay off

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:52.159
so it's not like I can just quit
my job.

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:01.868
Some things in life don't
give you any choices Ty.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.675
You just have to make them work.

01:14:26.628 --> 01:14:27.527
I'm sorry.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:37.504
Don't be sorry, it's not your
fault.

01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:44.077
Well, if it makes you feel any
better,

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:50.484
currently I'm $60,000 in debt,
I'm homeless, I'm unemployed

01:14:53.021 --> 01:14:56.690
and I've got a felony charge
on my permanent record.

01:14:58.093 --> 01:15:02.329
So I'd say sitting next to me,
you're looking pretty good.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:15.408
You know, that's the thing
I missed the most about you,

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:18.512
it's your optimism.

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:20.914
My optimism?

01:15:20.916 --> 01:15:21.748
Yeah.

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:22.616
Really?

01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:24.684
Yeah.

01:15:26.121 --> 01:15:30.690
I mean even before prison,
no matter what the situation,

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:33.693
you always looked at the glass
half full.

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:37.230
I don't know how you did it.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:44.771
Maybe it's just perspective.

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:48.441
You may hate your job
but at least you got one.

01:15:50.812 --> 01:15:52.946
You got food and a roof over
your head.

01:15:53.982 --> 01:15:55.815
A lot of folks don't even have
that.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:04.424
Yeah, you're right.

01:16:09.598 --> 01:16:11.932
And if you wanna be a
photographer,

01:16:14.002 --> 01:16:15.602
just go out and make it happen.

01:16:16.505 --> 01:16:21.575
Start taking pictures on the
weekends or in your spare time

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:23.810
because if you love something,

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:28.415
you make time for it.

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:36.823
I would but, I mean I
don't even have a camera

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:38.325
'cause I can't afford one.

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:40.527
Kate, you're already 40 grand
in debt,

01:16:40.529 --> 01:16:42.829
what's another two for
a really great camera?

01:16:44.566 --> 01:16:46.099
You'll pay it off eventually.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:49.869
Yeah, I guess.

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.039
I don't know, I'll see what I
can do.

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:55.542
Kate, just go get the camera.

01:16:57.579 --> 01:17:00.013
Dreams are worth taking a risk
on.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:03.516
All right, okay all right, I
will.

01:17:09.157 --> 01:17:12.792
So, now can I ask you a
question?

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:16.463
Sure.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:23.169
Did you ever think about

01:17:23.171 --> 01:17:24.971
what would have happened between
us

01:17:25.774 --> 01:17:27.173
if you didn't go to prison?

01:17:32.781 --> 01:17:36.750
Of course I did, everyday.

01:17:43.925 --> 01:17:44.824
Did you?

01:17:50.632 --> 01:17:52.165
Yeah, it's crossed my mind.

01:17:57.806 --> 01:17:59.739
I'm always gonna love you Tyler.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:09.382
You still love me?

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.287
In a way yes.

01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:22.562
I mean what we had, it was so
special.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:27.967
I'm never gonna forget that.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:44.484
I still love you.

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:45.652
You do know that right?

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.444
Ty, I can't.

01:19:14.416 --> 01:19:15.648
Yes you can.

01:19:16.718 --> 01:19:17.650
You can break up with him right
now.

01:19:17.652 --> 01:19:19.486
No, it's not that simple.

01:19:21.223 --> 01:19:22.455
You're only engaged.

01:19:26.595 --> 01:19:28.161
Ty, I'm pregnant.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:33.466
You're what?

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.205
I'm pregnant.

01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:51.117
No, I saw you drinking
tonight.

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:53.720
Well, you can't be pregnant.

01:19:54.723 --> 01:19:56.823
No, it was just sparkling
cider.

01:20:04.933 --> 01:20:05.832
So that's it?

01:20:06.968 --> 01:20:08.902
You're just gonna be with him
forever?

01:20:10.972 --> 01:20:12.405
You know, you could at least
pretend

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:14.007
to be a little happy for me.

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.211
Why should I be happy for you?

01:20:20.849 --> 01:20:22.215
You're not even happy.

01:20:37.532 --> 01:20:42.168
You deserve so much better.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:09.789
Kate's not feeling too well

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.824
so I think we're gonna get out
of here.

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.094
You sure?

01:22:15.096 --> 01:22:15.929
You can take one of the empty
rooms,

01:22:15.931 --> 01:22:17.830
we've got plenty of room.

01:22:17.832 --> 01:22:19.165
Yeah, I know.

01:22:19.167 --> 01:22:21.434
I just really wanna sleep
in my own bed tonight.

01:22:24.372 --> 01:22:25.471
Is she gonna be okay?

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:30.810
Yeah, I'll keep an eye on her.

01:22:34.215 --> 01:22:35.448
It'll be fine.

01:22:50.732 --> 01:22:53.733
Text me when you get home
safely.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.034
- I will.
- Bye.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:03.696
I guess everyone cleared out.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:09.869
Yup, except for Allison,
she's passed out on the couch.

01:25:10.905 --> 01:25:12.638
I'll go check up on her.

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.107
No man, she's good.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.208
Selena's watching her.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:21.881
You did some good work
on that bottle buddy.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:25.351
Yeah, it was either get drunk

01:25:25.353 --> 01:25:27.019
or beat the shit out of Zachary.

01:25:28.389 --> 01:25:30.123
Figured I'd get drunk, take the
high road.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:32.191
You should've beat
the shit out of Zachary.

01:25:32.193 --> 01:25:33.359
Right?

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:36.796
Next time.

01:25:43.771 --> 01:25:45.238
- Good catch.
- Thanks.

01:25:56.684 --> 01:26:01.654
Hey man, I'm sorry
about this whole thing.

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:05.224
Tonight really didn't go as
planned.

01:26:05.226 --> 01:26:06.392
It's not your fault.

01:26:07.662 --> 01:26:10.696
Well I mean, it is a
bit but not completely.

01:26:19.674 --> 01:26:21.674
I kind of freaked out on Kate
tonight.

01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:27.513
Yeah, I figured.

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.448
She seemed pretty upset when she
left.

01:26:31.486 --> 01:26:33.586
You don't even know the half
of it man.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:37.757
Well, what happened?

01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:43.229
Well, first of all, she's
pregnant.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.567
- No.
- Yeah.

01:26:47.569 --> 01:26:49.435
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:53.508 --> 01:26:54.407
Shit.

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.712
Yeah, that's why she got
engaged.

01:27:01.816 --> 01:27:03.382
I just can't believe it man.

01:27:07.322 --> 01:27:09.155
How long has he been unemployed
for?

01:27:11.993 --> 01:27:15.795
I think like maybe six
months without a nine to five

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:18.731
but he says he's freelancing now

01:27:19.667 --> 01:27:21.267
But, he has to be making no
money

01:27:21.269 --> 01:27:24.237
because Kate, that's
all she complains about

01:27:24.239 --> 01:27:25.271
is not having any.

01:27:31.913 --> 01:27:34.413
It's like they all just
gave up on their dreams man.

01:27:36.851 --> 01:27:39.452
You never told me, how come
you never settled down?

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:42.688
Yeah, I did.

01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:43.956
I like hoeing around.

01:27:46.694 --> 01:27:47.827
No, seriously man.

01:27:59.641 --> 01:28:00.973
I don't know,

01:28:02.410 --> 01:28:05.144
I guess I didn't wanna stop
trying new things you know?

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:09.282
I mean I'm 28, you're 28.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:12.551
This isn't like the end
all be all you know.

01:28:13.588 --> 01:28:16.989
I'm just now in my stride,
I got my business going.

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.360
You know what the problem is?

01:28:21.362 --> 01:28:22.528
What?

01:28:22.530 --> 01:28:25.865
The problem is people think
the party

01:28:25.867 --> 01:28:27.333
is over after college.

01:28:28.936 --> 01:28:33.306
They did it, that's it just stop
trying,

01:28:33.308 --> 01:28:36.008
stop doing new things, stop
taking risks.

01:28:36.010 --> 01:28:38.477
But it's not man it's not,

01:28:39.347 --> 01:28:41.080
since I graduated from college,

01:28:41.082 --> 01:28:44.884
I got fired from two
jobs, walked out on one,

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:46.886
fell for a pyramid scheme.

01:28:48.122 --> 01:28:51.157
I had three failed
business endeavors, three.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:53.259
But I learned so much
from all those failures.

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:55.428
It made me a better, stronger
person man.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:29:00.566
And people used to dog me bruh.

01:29:00.568 --> 01:29:03.602
They used to be like,
"Oh, he can't keep a job.

01:29:05.506 --> 01:29:06.372
"He's a loser.

01:29:06.374 --> 01:29:08.741
"He drinks too much.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.110
"He's a failure."

01:29:11.112 --> 01:29:15.881
But, everybody used to say that
shit.

01:29:17.051 --> 01:29:19.919
Everybody wrote me off
just because I wasn't doing

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.520
what I was supposed to be doing.

01:29:21.522 --> 01:29:22.355
Yeah, but at least
you're doing something

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:23.356
that you care about.

01:29:23.358 --> 01:29:24.724
Right, you know what I mean?

01:29:24.726 --> 01:29:26.292
And those same people that
called me off

01:29:26.294 --> 01:29:28.527
on my failures are the same ones

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:32.031
who are too afraid to fail
that they never even start.

01:29:33.401 --> 01:29:35.401
Like, who are you to judge?

01:29:35.403 --> 01:29:37.636
Like you're not happy with your
life,

01:29:37.638 --> 01:29:39.905
you're not, you're not.

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:42.308
You just post your
highlights on social media

01:29:42.310 --> 01:29:44.310
so people think that you're
happy

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:46.579
but you hate your life, you hate
it.

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:49.715
You go to the same job
that you hate every day,

01:29:49.717 --> 01:29:52.485
every week doing the
same shit over and over

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:55.421
and over again not changing
nothing and worrying about how

01:29:55.423 --> 01:29:57.923
and why my life isn't different.

01:29:57.925 --> 01:29:58.758
You know what I mean?

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.092
Like us as millennials,

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:01.594
yeah we might have the
cards stacked against us,

01:30:01.596 --> 01:30:03.996
but at least like try
something fucking new,

01:30:03.998 --> 01:30:06.599
do something different,
take a risk, God damn.

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:08.934
Well, that's why I couldn't
take it anymore in there man.

01:30:08.936 --> 01:30:11.237
Like if you're not happy with
your life,

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:12.638
do something about it.

01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:14.106
I mean, you've got a choice.

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.646
Well, it's not like you're in
prison?

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:23.516
Exactly, it's not
like you're prison man.

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.785
You can make anything happen

01:30:25.787 --> 01:30:27.520
in your life if you want to man.

01:30:27.522 --> 01:30:32.525
It's not like any of them
are in poverty or like Africa

01:30:35.096 --> 01:30:38.664
where you can get eaten
by a lion in the savanna.

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.833
Eaten by a lion?

01:30:40.835 --> 01:30:43.202
Yeah, I don't know man, I'm
drunk.

01:30:43.204 --> 01:30:45.838
You know what I mean man.

01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:49.008
Basically, life can be so much
worse.

01:31:01.322 --> 01:31:03.022
And for what it's worth,

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:08.027
I don't think any of them
could have lasted six days,

01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:10.629
let alone six years in prison.

01:31:12.567 --> 01:31:14.633
I have so much respect for you
man.

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:23.476
I really appreciate that man.

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:30.416
What are you doing?

01:31:30.418 --> 01:31:32.351
I'm trying to cheers.

01:31:34.188 --> 01:31:36.155
All right, to what?

01:31:37.658 --> 01:31:40.593
To you, to you being awesome.

01:31:44.165 --> 01:31:45.064
Ditto.

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:57.009
Dude, you're like batman.

01:31:57.879 --> 01:31:59.345
Batman, what do you mean?

01:31:59.347 --> 01:32:02.882
So you know Batman, he
saved Gotham City every night?

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.450
I know what Batman does yeah.

01:32:05.386 --> 01:32:10.456
Okay, so even though he
saves his city every night,

01:32:11.359 --> 01:32:13.726
people still find a reason to
complain.

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:21.567
They need him but they
take him for granted.

01:32:25.907 --> 01:32:26.805
Thank you man.

01:32:29.744 --> 01:32:31.644
You're the best.

01:32:31.646 --> 01:32:33.879
Dude, you're the best.

01:32:33.881 --> 01:32:34.914
We the best.

01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:38.884
And since we both are the best,

01:32:38.886 --> 01:32:41.053
we should line up two shots of
the best

01:32:41.055 --> 01:32:42.321
and it's right over there

01:32:43.190 --> 01:32:45.658
Hey Jay, you alright?

01:32:45.660 --> 01:32:47.993
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:32:47.995 --> 01:32:50.462
You got to walk that off
brother.

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.264
Now, let me line up these shots.

01:32:52.266 --> 01:32:55.134
Hey, hey why don't we just
call it?

01:32:56.537 --> 01:32:58.003
Great idea, I'll call the
stripper.

01:32:58.005 --> 01:33:00.940
No, no, no, let's go to bed
man.

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:01.774
Go to bed?

01:33:01.776 --> 01:33:03.842
Hmm mmh, you alright?

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.747
I just need to go to
the bathroom real quick.

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.916
I'm gonna puke and we can
ride this shit back up.

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:11.817
We're gonna be good.

01:33:11.819 --> 01:33:13.118
You know what buddy?

01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:14.587
We're gonna have so many
other nights to do that.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.622
I think right now we
should just go to bed.

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.593
Can I at least take some
turkey with me to bed?

01:33:21.462 --> 01:33:22.828
Absolutely, absolutely you can

01:33:24.632 --> 01:33:26.265
Some good stuff right here.

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:27.266
That's some good stuff, I'm
gonna bring it to you though.

01:33:27.268 --> 01:33:29.201
Huh?
I'm gonna bring it to you.

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:30.369
Dark meat only.

01:33:30.371 --> 01:33:32.171
Absolutely, I know it's your
favorite.

01:33:32.173 --> 01:33:34.473
Don't judge me, it's
not because I'm Black.

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:36.475
It's not that reason.

01:33:36.477 --> 01:33:37.443
I never said that.

01:33:37.445 --> 01:33:39.445
I just like it, I like it.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:53.158
Yo, hell yeah.

01:33:55.162 --> 01:33:56.328
Give me some of that.

01:34:00.835 --> 01:34:03.502
Dude, I made such a great turkey
tonight.

01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:05.704
Michelle would have been shook

01:34:05.706 --> 01:34:07.206
if she would've tried some of
it.

01:34:07.208 --> 01:34:09.074
She would've pulled out
the whips and chains for me

01:34:09.076 --> 01:34:11.143
and I would've let her keep
going.

01:34:11.145 --> 01:34:12.678
Yeah man, you did a
good job.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.313
I did a great job.

01:34:16.017 --> 01:34:18.550
Great, so you're good?

01:34:18.552 --> 01:34:20.252
You don't need anything else?

01:34:20.254 --> 01:34:21.520
Yeah, I'm good man.

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:27.493
You're going to bed?

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:30.696
No, I gotta stay up for a
little bit.

01:34:30.698 --> 01:34:32.364
You know I had that three hour
nap

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:34.767
and well someone's got to watch
Selena.

01:34:35.603 --> 01:34:39.371
Oh dude, we're the
worst babysitters ever.

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:40.739
Yeah, speak for yourself.

01:34:42.877 --> 01:34:43.776
Come on let's go.

01:34:43.778 --> 01:34:45.544
No, no, don't worry about it.

01:34:45.546 --> 01:34:46.512
I got it.

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.613
Yeah?

01:34:47.615 --> 01:34:49.014
I'll see you in the morning.

01:34:52.319 --> 01:34:53.886
Oh shit my bad man, hold up.

01:34:54.689 --> 01:34:56.588
I got something for you in the
closet.

01:34:56.590 --> 01:34:58.057
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a present.

01:34:58.893 --> 01:35:00.392
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:35:00.394 --> 01:35:01.894
Oh thanks man, you
didn't have to do that.

01:35:01.896 --> 01:35:04.096
Yeah man, just consider it a
present

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:06.131
for the six birthdays I missed.

01:35:08.202 --> 01:35:09.250
Okay.

01:35:09.252 --> 01:35:10.301
It's on the floor to
the right.

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:18.043
Can I open it now or?

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:20.279
Yeah, this ain't Christmas
Eve open that shit.

01:35:33.761 --> 01:35:37.329
Jay, this must've
cost you a fortune man.

01:35:38.165 --> 01:35:38.997
I can't accept this.

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:40.232
Yeah, you can man.

01:35:40.234 --> 01:35:41.100
You deserve it.

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:44.436
And it's brand new.

01:35:44.438 --> 01:35:46.472
Don't worry, I ain't steal
it or nothing like that.

01:35:46.474 --> 01:35:47.506
I just had to unwrap it

01:35:47.508 --> 01:35:49.775
so I could put all the photo
editing

01:35:49.777 --> 01:35:51.577
and software shit on there.

01:35:51.579 --> 01:35:52.811
Oh this is awesome man.

01:35:52.813 --> 01:35:54.580
Thank you so much.

01:35:54.582 --> 01:35:58.751
Enjoy it dude, but you
gotta promise me one thing?

01:35:58.753 --> 01:35:59.618
Yeah what?

01:36:01.956 --> 01:36:03.856
When we were in college,
I remember you saying

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:06.992
that you wanted to open
your own design company.

01:36:06.994 --> 01:36:09.094
Now, I don't know what your
dream is now

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:11.663
but whatever your dream is,

01:36:12.466 --> 01:36:15.000
don't stop until you get it man.

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.504
You're stronger than me Tyler.

01:36:18.506 --> 01:36:20.506
You are the a baddest White boy
I know.

01:36:21.642 --> 01:36:23.675
So if I can do it, you can too.

01:36:25.646 --> 01:36:30.215
I promise man.

01:36:30.217 --> 01:36:32.684
Now take your ass down
there and watch Selena.

01:36:33.654 --> 01:36:35.187
- I'm going to sleep.
- I will.

01:36:36.657 --> 01:36:37.956
Hey, come here.

01:36:41.996 --> 01:36:44.296
- Thanks man.
- Yeah man, of course.

01:36:47.067 --> 01:36:49.835
- Good night Justin.
- Good night man.

01:36:49.837 --> 01:36:51.970
Oh, I'm glad you're back.

01:36:56.477 --> 01:36:57.376
Me too.
