<i>Kristen:
Okay, are you ready?</i>

00:10.707 --> 00:12.741
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm. Joffrey.

00:12.742 --> 00:14.109
Jeffrey?

00:14.110 --> 00:16.646
Joffrey, like the ballet.

00:16.647 --> 00:19.115
Oh, that's...

00:19.116 --> 00:21.017
That's really good.

00:21.018 --> 00:23.220
You don't like it.

00:23.221 --> 00:25.255
No, no, I do.

00:25.256 --> 00:27.724
I-I think Joffrey's
a great name

00:27.725 --> 00:30.094
for a-a boy.

00:30.095 --> 00:31.995
You're lying, Ryan.
You won't even look at me.

00:31.996 --> 00:33.731
I'm sorry, Kristen.

00:33.732 --> 00:36.068
C-can you maybe just not
do that in front of me?

00:36.069 --> 00:38.137
Uh, no, Ryan,
I won't starve my baby for you.

00:38.138 --> 00:39.338
You're gonna have to get comfortable

00:39.339 --> 00:40.639
with stuff like this.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.841
I know, I know.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.376
Look, when we were little,

00:43.377 --> 00:45.712
I was the one who had
to hold the family together.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.347
I didn't ask for any help from you,

00:47.348 --> 00:49.283
but I am asking for it now.

00:49.284 --> 00:51.552
Joffrey needs a male influence
in his life, okay?

00:51.553 --> 00:52.720
Okay.

00:52.721 --> 00:54.388
I-I'm here for you,

00:54.389 --> 00:57.058
and I'll get comfortable
watching you breastfeed.

00:57.059 --> 00:59.094
Don't be a pervert, Ryan.

00:59.095 --> 01:00.729
Can you hold him?

01:00.730 --> 01:03.098
I am so thirsty; This baby
sucks the life out of me.

01:03.099 --> 01:04.566
Burp him?

01:04.566 --> 01:06.402
(Crying)

01:11.976 --> 01:13.711
Uh...

01:13.712 --> 01:15.680
(Crying continues)

01:15.681 --> 01:17.915
Uh... Kristen?

01:20.085 --> 01:21.519
Oh, Jesus.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.722
Shh, stop crying.

01:23.723 --> 01:24.856
Stop crying.

01:24.857 --> 01:26.725
You're good; Stop crying.

01:26.726 --> 01:29.595
Shh, stop crying.

01:29.596 --> 01:31.063
Stop crying.

01:31.064 --> 01:32.465
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

01:32.466 --> 01:34.067
Um...

01:34.068 --> 01:35.569
Stop crying.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.537
Shh.
I just...

01:37.538 --> 01:39.406
I-I need, uh...

01:41.176 --> 01:42.744
(Panting, gasping)

01:42.745 --> 01:44.479
Ryan?

01:44.480 --> 01:46.381
Talk to me mate.
What's going on?

01:46.382 --> 01:48.249
Ryan! Oh, my God.

01:48.250 --> 01:49.817
It's a panic attack.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.952
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God.

01:51.953 --> 01:53.954
We're having a panic attack down here.

01:53.955 --> 01:55.757
I'm okay.

01:55.758 --> 01:58.125
You okay?

01:58.126 --> 01:59.827
I don't know what just happened.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.996
I-I was holding
Kristen's baby, and...

02:01.997 --> 02:03.698
And-and it started to cry,

02:03.699 --> 02:05.834
and then all of a sudden,
it felt like I was...

02:05.835 --> 02:08.036
I-I was suffocating.

02:08.037 --> 02:09.571
You just say the word, and that baby

02:09.572 --> 02:11.239
will pay for what it's done to you.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.009
Don't do anything to the baby, Wilfred.

02:14.010 --> 02:16.311
We understand each other.

02:16.312 --> 02:17.746
Seriously, don't.

02:17.747 --> 02:20.482
Right, gotcha.

02:20.483 --> 02:22.217
The-the baby's not
the problem, Wilfred.

02:26.623 --> 02:29.559
Oh, my God.

02:29.560 --> 02:32.061
Ryan, look at what your panic
is doing to me.

02:32.062 --> 02:34.664
I'm absorbing

02:34.665 --> 02:36.500
your stress.

02:40.138 --> 02:41.906
Ryan,

02:41.907 --> 02:45.409
we need to find out the
cause of this anxiety.

02:45.410 --> 02:47.478
It's not the baby.

02:47.479 --> 02:50.814
Maybe it's your mom getting worse

02:50.815 --> 02:52.482
or losing your job?

02:52.483 --> 02:53.984
I can find another job,

02:53.985 --> 02:56.586
and my mom's getting better.

02:56.587 --> 02:59.055
What about Amanda?

02:59.056 --> 03:00.858
What about Amanda?

03:00.859 --> 03:02.793
Well, just, we've never talked about it.

03:02.794 --> 03:04.194
What's there to talk about?

03:04.195 --> 03:05.729
We broke up.

03:05.730 --> 03:07.064
It sucks, but that's life.

03:07.065 --> 03:08.532
Can we drop it, please?

03:08.533 --> 03:10.367
What about your boss' suicide?

03:10.368 --> 03:12.837
I mean, someone ate his brains.

03:12.838 --> 03:14.639
I mean, that's twisted.

03:14.640 --> 03:16.574
Did they ever find who
did that, by the way?

03:18.611 --> 03:20.946
So, this will mellow me out?

03:20.947 --> 03:23.348
You ask a lot of questions, bro.

03:23.349 --> 03:25.150
I asked one question.

03:25.151 --> 03:27.153
No, no, no, it's good, man.

03:27.154 --> 03:29.322
You know, I had a lot of questions, too.

03:29.323 --> 03:33.192
I just got back from an
insane two weeks in Peru, man.

03:33.193 --> 03:35.060
Had a glorious spiritual awakening.

03:35.061 --> 03:37.431
Got an assload of answers.

03:37.432 --> 03:39.800
You ever hear of Ayahuasca?

03:39.801 --> 03:41.402
It's unreal, man.

03:41.403 --> 03:43.270
Both:
What is it?

03:43.271 --> 03:45.106
It's this extract from a vine.

03:45.107 --> 03:46.507
They call it "The Teacher"

03:46.508 --> 03:48.376
because while you're tripping on it,

03:48.377 --> 03:50.912
you're supposed to ask yourself
these questions and shit,

03:50.913 --> 03:53.714
and the answers come from
with inside your brain, man.

03:53.715 --> 03:55.550
So, what did you ask?

03:55.551 --> 03:57.252
That's between me and my spirit guide.

03:57.253 --> 04:00.889
Anyway, I brought some back with me.

04:00.890 --> 04:02.757
Could sell you a little bit if you want.

04:06.028 --> 04:07.161
I'll take some.

04:07.162 --> 04:08.395
Right on.

04:08.396 --> 04:10.297
I'm excited for you.

04:11.700 --> 04:14.135
(Muttering)

04:14.136 --> 04:17.605
I should warn you, the trip
will probably start out

04:17.606 --> 04:19.106
with some nausea and vomiting.

04:19.107 --> 04:20.274
Awesome.

04:20.274 --> 04:21.875
Also, make sure

04:21.877 --> 04:23.545
you surrender to your trip completely,

04:23.546 --> 04:26.548
'cause if you fight it even a little bit,

04:26.549 --> 04:28.450
your trip could turn into a nightmare.

04:28.451 --> 04:30.652
W-what do you mean?
You could lose your mind completely

04:30.653 --> 04:32.253
and never come back.

04:32.254 --> 04:35.322
All right, let's do this, Ryan.
Thanks, mate.

04:35.323 --> 04:37.158
You know what, I changed my mind.

04:37.159 --> 04:38.826
Um, can I just get my money back?

04:38.827 --> 04:40.128
Sorry, man.

04:40.129 --> 04:42.329
No refunds, store policy.

04:44.466 --> 04:46.033
You got to find a way to calm down.

04:46.034 --> 04:47.268
I'm shedding my ass off over here.

04:47.269 --> 04:49.370
It's not noticeable, is it?

04:49.371 --> 04:51.939
(Ringtone playing)

04:51.940 --> 04:53.841
Hey, Kristen.

04:53.842 --> 04:55.743
Did I leave Joffrey's pacifier
at your place?

04:55.744 --> 04:58.279
(Baby screaming) Um, I'm not sure.

04:58.280 --> 05:00.248
Let me ask in a different way.

05:00.249 --> 05:02.483
I left Joffrey's pacifier at your place.

05:02.484 --> 05:04.385
Can you please find it?

05:06.555 --> 05:08.022
Sure.

05:08.023 --> 05:09.290
Thank you.

05:09.291 --> 05:10.591
Just being such a little dickhead.

05:10.592 --> 05:12.126
Sorry, d-head.

05:12.127 --> 05:14.194
You know, he will not
stop crying without it.

05:14.195 --> 05:15.396
Shh, Joffrey.

05:15.397 --> 05:17.631
Don't cry, baby, don't cry.

05:17.632 --> 05:19.500
It's okay; Stop crying.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.568
Okay, stop crying please.
Um, Kristen?

05:21.569 --> 05:23.070
I got to... I got to run.

05:23.071 --> 05:24.304
I'll call you back.

05:24.305 --> 05:25.506
(Gasping) What's happening?

05:25.507 --> 05:26.974
Are we panicking?

05:26.975 --> 05:28.642
Shit.

05:28.643 --> 05:30.010
We are panicking.

05:30.011 --> 05:31.078
Here we go.

05:31.079 --> 05:33.113
Ryan.

05:33.114 --> 05:34.648
I-I wasn't even holding the baby.
Ryan.

05:34.649 --> 05:36.016
I just heard it.

05:36.017 --> 05:37.284
Just got to pull ourselves together.

05:37.285 --> 05:39.086
Wilfred, calm down.

05:39.087 --> 05:40.387
Aah! No!

05:40.388 --> 05:42.622
You calm down.

05:42.623 --> 05:44.391
First my tail and now bear?

05:44.392 --> 05:46.026
Why are you doing this to us?

05:46.027 --> 05:48.996
Mmm, it's gonna be okay.

05:48.997 --> 05:51.699
We're gonna figure this out.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.367
You're right; Of course we are.

05:53.368 --> 05:55.036
(Panting)

05:55.037 --> 05:56.537
That's what the Ayahuasca's for.

05:56.538 --> 05:58.206
What? Are you kidding me?

05:58.207 --> 06:00.074
I couldn't handle a drug
like that right now.

06:00.075 --> 06:01.376
I'd lose my mind.

06:01.377 --> 06:03.478
Well, I hope that's not true.
Why?

06:03.479 --> 06:06.614
Because you've kind of been
drinking it all this time.

06:12.871 --> 06:14.371
Wilfred, how could you do this?

06:14.372 --> 06:15.906
I don't know, Ryan.
I'm a monster.

06:15.907 --> 06:17.775
But you can fix bear, I know you can.

06:17.776 --> 06:19.443
I don't care about bear.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.044
You dosed me with a dangerous
hallucinogenic drug.

06:21.045 --> 06:22.246
That was a joke.

06:22.247 --> 06:23.480
So, you didn't dose me?

06:23.481 --> 06:24.881
No, I dosed you.

06:24.882 --> 06:26.283
The thing about fixing bear,
that was a joke.

06:26.284 --> 06:27.751
We need to get to a hospital.

06:27.752 --> 06:29.252
Come on, Ryan, bear doesn't have insurance.

06:29.253 --> 06:31.455
I meant me.
There's no time.

06:31.456 --> 06:32.823
I feel sick.

06:32.824 --> 06:34.791
I-I... I can't do this.

06:34.792 --> 06:37.193
You can do this.

06:37.194 --> 06:39.295
It'll be worth it.

06:39.296 --> 06:41.097
You'll find the answer
to your panic attack,

06:41.098 --> 06:42.432
and I'll get my tail back.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.434
Just don't fight it.

06:44.435 --> 06:48.404
If you do, you could lose yourself

06:48.405 --> 06:51.207
inside your own head for all eternity.

06:51.208 --> 06:53.877
But most importantly,

06:53.878 --> 06:55.879
have fun with it.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.615
Maybe if I just rest.

07:06.424 --> 07:08.658
Hey, Ryan, look.

07:14.999 --> 07:16.666
Oh, my God, Ryan!

07:16.667 --> 07:18.802
There's so much good stuff out here.

07:20.304 --> 07:22.072
There's a lot of good stuff up ahead.

07:22.073 --> 07:23.339
I'm gonna go check it out.

07:23.340 --> 07:26.409
Oh, wow, it's so good.

07:28.112 --> 07:30.146
Wait till you see what's ahead.

07:30.147 --> 07:31.481
Okay, sorry, go at your own pace.

07:31.482 --> 07:32.882
There's no rush.

07:32.883 --> 07:35.452
But just hurry up.

07:35.453 --> 07:37.620
Wilfred,

07:37.621 --> 07:39.722
none of this is real.

07:39.723 --> 07:41.657
I know that, Ryan.

07:41.658 --> 07:43.960
Right now, you're passed out
in the basement,

07:43.961 --> 07:45.661
and I'm eating vomit off your shirt,

07:45.662 --> 07:48.797
but while we're here,
try to learn something.

07:48.798 --> 07:50.532
Learn something?

07:50.533 --> 07:52.100
How?

07:52.101 --> 07:54.202
How.

07:54.203 --> 07:57.105
Ryan, I am red wolf.

07:57.106 --> 07:59.507
I am your spirit guide.

07:59.508 --> 08:00.875
Spirit guide?

08:00.876 --> 08:03.277
The journey ahead of you

08:03.278 --> 08:05.279
is one of great enlightenment,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.015
but also great treachery.

08:08.016 --> 08:09.650
(Clears throat) Can I...

08:09.651 --> 08:12.019
Can I talk to you for a second?

08:12.020 --> 08:14.455
Uh, listen, uh, what was it?

08:14.456 --> 08:16.657
Red bull?
Red wolf.

08:16.658 --> 08:20.495
Right. I think we might be
overlapping a bit.

08:20.496 --> 08:22.530
I do not get your meaning.

08:22.531 --> 08:24.499
The thing is,

08:24.500 --> 08:27.168
I'm sort of already with this guy.

08:27.169 --> 08:29.304
Ryan requires a spirit guide,

08:29.305 --> 08:31.907
and I am well-trained
in such matters.

08:31.908 --> 08:33.808
Yeah, and I kind of
hear what you're saying.

08:33.809 --> 08:35.010
It's just that

08:35.010 --> 08:36.544
Ryan and I already know each other,

08:36.546 --> 08:38.881
so I think it'd probably be faster...

08:38.881 --> 08:40.350
Faster is not better.

08:40.351 --> 08:42.085
Trust me.

08:42.086 --> 08:43.620
I have not failed anyone yet.
Yet?

08:43.621 --> 08:46.289
Aha, so you're admitting
there's a possibility.

08:46.290 --> 08:47.758
You doubt my abilities?

08:47.759 --> 08:49.760
No, no, no, no, no one's doing that.

08:49.761 --> 08:53.097
I'm sure you're
a fantastic "spirit guide."

08:53.098 --> 08:55.766
Take the air-quotes out,
and yes.

08:57.969 --> 08:59.369
Having learned from my father

08:59.370 --> 09:01.104
who learned from his father

09:01.105 --> 09:02.473
who learned from his father...

09:02.474 --> 09:03.907
I'm not questioning

09:03.908 --> 09:05.442
your qualifications.
Why are you even...

09:05.443 --> 09:07.344
I am just going to finish my thought,

09:07.345 --> 09:09.947
if that is okay with you.

09:09.948 --> 09:12.316
Having learned from his
father before (squeaks) him.

09:12.317 --> 09:14.218
I-I'm sorry,
"before (squeaks) him"?

09:14.219 --> 09:15.186
Him.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.253
How's puberty going?

09:16.254 --> 09:17.288
I see.

09:17.289 --> 09:18.589
Because my voice cracked,

09:18.590 --> 09:20.558
you are trying to undercut me

09:20.559 --> 09:22.493
to make me feel inferior.

09:22.494 --> 09:24.162
I'm not trying to undercut anyone.

09:24.163 --> 09:26.965
I just want to know if you need
a lift to the junior prom.

09:26.966 --> 09:29.134
I can drop you off a block away,
if you're embarrassed.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.636
It's kind of hard for me to tell
if you are embarrassed because,

09:31.637 --> 09:33.637
well, because your face is already red.

09:33.638 --> 09:36.240
Wilfred, enough.

09:36.241 --> 09:38.541
I just want to get started.

09:38.542 --> 09:41.210
Red wolf, I'm sorry about him.

09:41.211 --> 09:43.546
You can guide me.
What?!

09:43.547 --> 09:45.381
This is bullshit!
No, what is bullshit

09:45.382 --> 09:47.983
is that you would slip drugs
into my tea without telling me.

09:47.984 --> 09:49.718
You call yourself

09:49.719 --> 09:51.420
my best friend, but you're
always screwing with me.

09:51.421 --> 09:53.822
I mean, who are you?

09:53.823 --> 09:55.224
Is that your question, Ryan?

09:55.225 --> 09:56.592
Now, hang on.

09:56.593 --> 09:58.694
L-let's not get
too crazy here.

09:58.695 --> 10:00.396
You already have a question, remember?

10:00.397 --> 10:01.931
It-it's the panic.

10:01.932 --> 10:04.734
No.

10:04.735 --> 10:07.503
I want to know the truth about Wilfred.

10:09.506 --> 10:11.407
What is Wilfred?

10:11.408 --> 10:13.242
That's my question.

10:13.243 --> 10:14.978
The truth will be revealed.

10:14.979 --> 10:16.579
Ryan, you're making a big mistake.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.447
Wilfred, stay.

10:21.184 --> 10:23.152
Really, dude?

10:28.496 --> 10:31.864
It's beautiful.

10:31.865 --> 10:36.202
Everything is so strange and magical yet...

10:36.203 --> 10:38.604
Somehow familiar.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.939
It all comes from within you, Ryan.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.542
All that you see here

10:43.543 --> 10:46.312
are creations of your own mind.

10:46.313 --> 10:49.615
Perhaps that explains why
I am such a stereotype.

10:55.822 --> 10:57.723
I feel like I've seen this in a movie.

10:57.724 --> 10:59.491
(Sighs deeply)

10:59.492 --> 11:01.293
You have definitely seen this in a movie.

11:01.294 --> 11:03.829
Sorry.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.797
I do not judge.

11:05.798 --> 11:09.000
It is my sincere hope

11:09.001 --> 11:12.070
that during this time we spend
together, that you...

11:12.071 --> 11:13.271
(Ringtone playing)

11:16.042 --> 11:18.276
(Ringtone continues)

11:21.914 --> 11:23.848
Shh.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.450
Let it go to voice-mail.

11:30.389 --> 11:32.824
Where are we?

11:32.825 --> 11:35.593
Sometimes, when a question
does not want to be answered,

11:35.594 --> 11:38.596
it is necessary to travel to a place

11:38.597 --> 11:40.131
where your mind has never before been.

11:40.132 --> 11:42.066
Are we going to be able to get back?

11:42.067 --> 11:45.837
Do not worry, Ryan.
As long as you stay with me,

11:45.838 --> 11:49.307
I will guide you safely back
home after your journey.

11:52.978 --> 11:56.080
Black files...
Why are those here?

11:56.081 --> 11:59.784
They are here because your mind
has brought them here.

11:59.785 --> 12:03.588
Everything and everyone...
All that happens.

12:08.961 --> 12:09.928
That is your sister.

12:17.170 --> 12:20.672
This... is the
spring of truth.

12:23.476 --> 12:27.479
Gaze into the water with
your question in your heart...

12:29.849 --> 12:33.019
And from the depths...

12:33.020 --> 12:36.356
Your answer will rise.

12:36.357 --> 12:40.994
Remember, Ryan, do not look with your eyes,

12:40.995 --> 12:42.629
look with your heart.

12:46.968 --> 12:48.202
(Sighs)

12:50.672 --> 12:51.705
What is Wilfred?

12:51.706 --> 12:53.874
(Singing a mystical chant)

13:00.215 --> 13:02.283
Something's happening.

13:02.284 --> 13:03.617
(Continues singing)

13:03.618 --> 13:05.553
The water is, uh...
(Thwipping)

13:05.554 --> 13:07.722
(Gagging)

13:10.225 --> 13:11.525
Wilfred!

13:11.526 --> 13:12.926
What? Me?

13:12.927 --> 13:14.828
(Grunts)

13:14.829 --> 13:18.032
Yeah, you're not gonna
see much truth in there.

13:18.033 --> 13:20.568
How's the quest going, by the way?

13:20.569 --> 13:22.136
What have you done?!

13:22.137 --> 13:24.572
You're turning my trip into a nightmare!

13:24.573 --> 13:27.075
No, Ryan, you're turning
this trip into a nightmare

13:27.076 --> 13:28.943
because you're not
asking the real question:

13:28.944 --> 13:32.280
Why do you panic every
time that baby cries?

13:32.281 --> 13:34.149
Uh, I don't know.

13:34.150 --> 13:35.884
Because it reminds me of
a responsibility I don't want,

13:35.885 --> 13:38.020
or can't handle, or my failed relationship,

13:38.021 --> 13:39.788
or my job, or something about something...

13:39.789 --> 13:41.189
But none of that matters now,

13:41.190 --> 13:42.824
because without my spirit guide,

13:42.825 --> 13:44.193
I'm gonna be trapped in here forever!

13:44.194 --> 13:45.661
You don't need him, Ryan!

13:45.662 --> 13:47.229
I can be your spirit guide!

13:49.599 --> 13:51.100
Fine.

13:51.101 --> 13:52.602
Just... guide us out of here.

13:52.603 --> 13:54.637
It would be my greatest honor.

13:56.000 --> 14:02.074

14:05.182 --> 14:06.048
Yeah, we're lost.

14:12.451 --> 14:14.119
Wilfred:
I'd like to apologize.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.487
Great.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.755
But I can't, because I'm not sorry.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.189
Course not!

14:18.190 --> 14:20.458
I'm not sorry because it was necessary.

14:20.459 --> 14:23.494
There are some questions that you're
not ready to find out... not yet.

14:23.495 --> 14:25.763
You're the one who brought
me here in the first place.

14:25.764 --> 14:27.565
To figure out why Kristen's baby

14:27.566 --> 14:29.333
causes you so much anxiety...

14:29.334 --> 14:31.301
That's the answer you need now.

14:31.302 --> 14:34.404
So, ô wise spirit guide, what's the answer?

14:34.405 --> 14:35.939
Sorry, mate, there's some questions

14:35.940 --> 14:37.507
even I don't have the answer to.

14:37.508 --> 14:39.242
(Anxious gasp, panting)

14:39.243 --> 14:40.810
I can't believe I'm gonna freeze to death

14:40.811 --> 14:42.278
inside my own head.

14:42.279 --> 14:44.180
(Distant, eerie howling)
Here, this'll help.

14:44.181 --> 14:45.615
Distract you from the cold.

14:45.616 --> 14:48.084
Seriously? You dosed
my tea with Ayahuasca.

14:48.085 --> 14:49.686
Ryan...
If you think I'm gonna

14:49.687 --> 14:51.754
eat or drink anything
you give me, ever again,

14:51.755 --> 14:53.056
you're tripping harder than I am.

14:53.057 --> 14:55.524
Exactly!
You're already tripping!

14:55.525 --> 14:56.559
None of this is real!

14:56.560 --> 14:58.226
I'm not real!

14:58.227 --> 15:00.393
I'm just a version of me
that exists in your head.

15:00.394 --> 15:01.828
So, think about it, Ryan...

15:01.829 --> 15:04.029
Would you dose yourself?

15:04.030 --> 15:06.197
(Unsure):
No...

15:06.198 --> 15:08.533
This flask is just your subconscious self

15:08.534 --> 15:10.868
trying to help you imagine
a way to keep warm.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.440
Suit yourself.

15:19.579 --> 15:21.146
(Laughing)

15:21.147 --> 15:23.715
Oh, my God! I can't
believe you fell for it!

15:23.716 --> 15:25.550
That was totally more Ayahuasca.

15:25.551 --> 15:28.253
What?! I knew it!
This is such...

15:28.254 --> 15:30.555
Ryan, the whole reason
we're here is to get answers,

15:30.556 --> 15:32.690
and since you were clearly
giving up like a little bitch,

15:32.691 --> 15:33.958
I had to intervene.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.926
You have to go deeper for this one.

15:35.927 --> 15:38.095
I'm gonna kill you.

15:38.096 --> 15:40.130
And also, the real me
has been down in the basement

15:40.131 --> 15:42.098
with the real, passed-out you
for quite a while now,

15:42.099 --> 15:43.700
so I probably need to piss pretty badly,

15:43.701 --> 15:45.068
so hurry up, okay?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.003
Oh... oh, God.
I feel sick.

15:47.004 --> 15:48.638
Perfect.

15:48.639 --> 15:50.274
I'll just wait here,
eating vomit off your shirt.

15:53.711 --> 15:54.912
Amanda...?

15:56.548 --> 15:58.582
Oh, Ryan, guess what?

15:58.583 --> 15:59.983
You're about to trip within a trip

15:59.984 --> 16:01.852
into a trip within a trip.

16:01.853 --> 16:03.387
(Weakly):
What does that even...?

16:25.643 --> 16:28.344
Yeah, Ryan, I know you're there.

16:28.345 --> 16:29.545
Just wait.

16:29.546 --> 16:32.015
Do I know you?

16:35.152 --> 16:38.422
Yes... and no.

16:38.423 --> 16:39.990
So...

16:39.991 --> 16:42.159
How's Wilfred doing?

16:42.160 --> 16:44.695
Is he behaving himself?

16:46.998 --> 16:48.732
Yes and no.

16:48.733 --> 16:50.767
Why so cryptic?

16:50.768 --> 16:54.037
I-I just thought that's
what we do here.

16:59.677 --> 17:00.744
That's my couch.

17:00.745 --> 17:01.878
It wasn't here before.

17:01.879 --> 17:03.714
Oh, terrific.

17:03.715 --> 17:05.714
I guess we better do this.

17:05.715 --> 17:07.983
What is your question?

17:07.984 --> 17:09.685
Um... yeah.

17:09.686 --> 17:12.188
Why do I panic around crying babies?

17:13.723 --> 17:15.391
Nothing is developing.

17:18.929 --> 17:20.296
What's my stuff doing here?

17:20.297 --> 17:21.763
I guess you're moving in.

17:21.765 --> 17:23.298
What?!

17:23.299 --> 17:24.398
Wh... I'm getting
trapped down here.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.701
What do I do?

17:25.702 --> 17:28.604
You just have to ask the right question.

17:28.605 --> 17:30.072
I thought I...

17:30.073 --> 17:31.740
You're running out of time, Ryan!

17:31.741 --> 17:33.208
I'm just here to find out
why I'm panicking!

17:33.209 --> 17:34.676
Why am I panicking?

17:34.677 --> 17:37.312
Ah... now here we go.

17:41.985 --> 17:43.486
Now, this...

17:46.024 --> 17:48.058
Takes me back.

17:48.059 --> 17:50.861
Or should I say, takes you back.

18:10.883 --> 18:12.517
(Dog barking)

18:14.453 --> 18:15.720
Sneakers...

18:15.721 --> 18:18.289
(Crying)

18:18.290 --> 18:21.426
Ryan, Ryan, stop crying.

18:21.427 --> 18:22.560
You can't cry.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.196
It's gonna make mom upset.

18:24.197 --> 18:25.630
And then dad's gonna get mad,

18:25.631 --> 18:27.332
and they're gonna start fighting more.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.902
Okay? Stop crying.
Don't cry.

18:29.903 --> 18:34.974
Jesus, it's so... sad.

18:34.975 --> 18:37.077
(Crying continues)

18:37.078 --> 18:39.112
It wasn't the baby crying...

18:39.113 --> 18:42.582
It was Kristen telling the baby not to cry.

18:42.583 --> 18:44.251
Because that's what she told me.

18:47.288 --> 18:49.156
I never stopped not crying.

18:51.593 --> 18:53.961
Maybe it's time.

18:57.033 --> 18:59.603
Man:
See you round, Ryan.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.178
(Owl hooting)

19:08.282 --> 19:09.649
Hey, man, how was your trip?

19:11.251 --> 19:13.486
It was...

19:13.487 --> 19:14.587
Wait.

19:19.327 --> 19:20.794
Hey, mate.

19:20.795 --> 19:22.329
How was your trip?

19:24.499 --> 19:26.968
It was...

19:26.969 --> 19:28.803
Well, I'd love to hear about it.

19:28.804 --> 19:30.338
Perhaps outside?

19:30.339 --> 19:31.439
Over a walk?

19:45.189 --> 19:46.856
I'm sad, Wilfred.

19:50.461 --> 19:52.062
I'm really sad.

20:20.022 --> 20:21.990
(Crying quietly)

20:27.797 --> 20:29.964
I really do need to go out, though.

20:29.965 --> 20:32.901
(Laughing)
