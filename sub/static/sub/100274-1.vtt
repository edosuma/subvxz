01:00.541 --> 01:01.541
[Nick] Yes, always.

"Us, the future of the self."

It's a new app,
I need it for my dissertation.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.041
Please, think of it as a game.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.750
It can be sexy if you want.

02:07.833 --> 02:08.666
[Nick] Hm.

02:09.208 --> 02:11.125
But you know I'm better in the flesh.

02:12.416 --> 02:14.125
Look, I just downloaded it.

02:14.208 --> 02:15.041

02:15.125 --> 02:17.000
[Eva] First of all, I'll sign you up.

02:17.083 --> 02:19.250
Name? Is Lorenzo okay?

02:19.333 --> 02:20.583
I like it.

02:20.666 --> 02:22.083
I want to be Sara.

02:22.166 --> 02:24.625
I don't know why,
I've always felt like a Sara.

02:25.250 --> 02:27.750
Who knows if we're a perfect match,
you and I.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.875
Algorithm and reality may not coincide,
you know?

02:33.583 --> 02:36.250
Why make me jealous
now that I'm about to leave?

02:36.916 --> 02:39.000
It's a chapter in my dissertation.

02:40.458 --> 02:44.291
The Effect of Technology

02:45.041 --> 02:45.916

Ivan.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.125
He won't mind.

03:00.708 --> 03:03.000
See, it all starts with the data.

03:03.083 --> 03:04.791
The more accurate the better.

03:05.916 --> 03:07.541
Okay, I'll help you.

short-term relationship or sex chat?

03:18.875 --> 03:20.041
Hm. Careful.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.666
I'd say short-term.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.291
Okay.

03:23.375 --> 03:26.166
[Nick] Doesn't it bother you
to think of me in Italy

03:26.250 --> 03:27.916
chatting up a stranger?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.416
Of course it bothers me.

-I've moved around a lot.
-Mm.

Is there anything I can do?

you always keep your promises.

I don't want it. Give it away
or chuck it out, I don't care.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.583
Okay. Listen, how are Mom and Dad?

07:13.666 --> 07:16.083

It's more fun when they're away.

scary movies and midnight snacks.

See you!

Good evening. Sorry to bother you,
I've never done this before.

07:41.791 --> 07:43.958
Can I give you my brother's CV?

07:44.041 --> 07:48.250
He's a marketing graduate,
top of his class, but he can't get a job.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.708
Maybe you or your father
could help him out.

07:50.791 --> 07:54.083
Listen, forget about my father,
but I'll do what I can.

07:54.666 --> 07:55.750
Really?

07:55.833 --> 07:56.791
Yes, really.

One last thing...

08:00.166 --> 08:01.625
Can I take a picture?

on my phone. Shall I block her?

It's an app, not a game,

Okay.

09:57.041 --> 09:57.875
So?

09:57.958 --> 10:01.958

your position within the company.

-Your father won't be 60 forever.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.416
Are you there, Lorenzo?

10:07.500 --> 10:09.708
[Nick] Tommaso,
there's nothing else to say.

10:09.791 --> 10:12.416
We've said everything,
there's nothing to define.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.916
[Nick] Dad won't talk to me.
He doesn't want me to be an actor.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.166
He wants to talk--

10:17.250 --> 10:18.791
That's why he sent his lawyer.

10:18.875 --> 10:23.208
He'd rather avoid certain topics.
Plus I've known you forever.

10:23.291 --> 10:25.916
Listen. You have a month
to change your mind.

10:26.583 --> 10:28.208
You know what you're giving up?

10:29.125 --> 10:30.708
I don't want to change my mind.

10:30.791 --> 10:33.458
Don't make your wealth out
to be a death sentence.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.500
These are just dreams.

10:35.583 --> 10:38.041
[Tommaso] You're young, it's normal, but...

10:39.000 --> 10:41.666
Tommaso, I'm about to shoot a film.
This is real.

10:41.750 --> 10:42.791
But we're talking--

-Enjoy.
-We're talking about 400 million.

[Tommaso] How many kids
want to be in your shoes?

10:52.208 --> 10:54.666
-I'm so turned on...
-[Tommaso] It's a joke to him!

10:58.416 --> 11:00.916
I haven't asked him for anything
in two years.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.208
You live in a house he's paying for.

11:03.875 --> 11:06.916
And you're taking an acting course
you could never afford.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.333
By all means...

11:09.291 --> 11:10.958
there's nothing wrong with that.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.375
That's what families are for.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.250
But stop playing the poor kid.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.125
[Tommaso] I care about you.

11:19.958 --> 11:21.000
Think about it.

11:21.833 --> 11:22.666
Wait.

11:25.083 --> 11:27.125
Get him an interview, he's good.

Here are the keys,

11:44.250 --> 11:47.750
you got the energy to concentrate
on what to do with the character.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.250
[Paolo] Okay, now I have to go.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.291
No, don't stop.

12:03.791 --> 12:04.750
Okay?

12:04.833 --> 12:06.791
When I'm back from location scouting,

12:06.875 --> 12:09.833
we'll sit and talk
about how we're going to do this now.

12:09.916 --> 12:11.583
-Okay?
-Okay.

12:21.583 --> 12:22.708
Hi, Ofelia.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.083
That's your name, right?

12:26.833 --> 12:27.708
[Ofelia] Yes.

12:27.791 --> 12:29.958
Is there anything I can do?

Focused and worried.

13:57.208 --> 13:58.333
[Eva]  So, nothing new.

13:58.416 --> 14:01.833
Apparently lots of actors have lost
their minds playing Jesus.

14:01.916 --> 14:03.791
[Nick] I met the director today.

14:04.375 --> 14:07.625
-I'm getting nervous.
- [Eva]  Nick, you were born to be an actor.

14:07.708 --> 14:11.000
What else could someone like you do?

14:12.166 --> 14:13.375
[Eva]  How about Us?

14:13.958 --> 14:14.791
About what?

14:14.875 --> 14:17.291
Us, my dissertation, remember?

14:17.791 --> 14:19.958
Yeah. Your app's kind of sad.

[Eva]  My app? I wish it were mine!

At first it's funny, it's even hot.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.500
[Nick] But what do you think
they're looking for?

14:31.875 --> 14:33.166
What are you looking for?

14:33.666 --> 14:35.500
Nothing. That's why I'm deleting it.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.750
[Nick] I'll unsubscribe

14:38.833 --> 14:41.416
Wait! You know it's important for me.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.666
[Eva]  True, some people just want sex,

14:44.750 --> 14:46.250
but others dream about love.

14:46.333 --> 14:48.500
It's in the data.
I studied all the numbers.

14:48.583 --> 14:53.125
The algorithms predict
how a user acts and thinks,

14:53.208 --> 14:56.125
and find a match based on
all sorts of parameters.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.333

she met through an app.

hot and well-educated as you.

-No, thanks Ofelia, it's okay.

on my laptop, is that normal?

[Eva]  Yes, of course, it's all connected.

-[Eva]  Just Sara. Trust me, that's plenty.

Is that so, Maria?

17:35.083 --> 17:36.541
Nothing. I was just teasing.

17:36.625 --> 17:38.583
[Eva]  Anyway, you're a disappointment.

I thought we'd be a perfect match
but I don't know.

Maybe we're less perfect than we think.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.041
Come on, I like this, I like it a lot.

31:29.958 --> 31:31.208
Cool.

31:32.333 --> 31:34.125
I've never seen that toy.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.291
What the fuck? Are you crazy?

32:05.458 --> 32:08.250
Can I come? I'll hide.
I'll make myself small.

32:08.333 --> 32:09.583
That won't work.

32:10.416 --> 32:12.291
But you could send me a photo.

32:13.250 --> 32:16.625
-I want to know what you look like.
-[Maria]  I could send any photo

32:16.708 --> 32:17.583
and say it's me.

32:17.666 --> 32:21.083
I don't trust images.
I only trust meetings, real ones.

32:21.166 --> 32:22.916
You're right. Forget it.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.416
[Maria]  Why are you avoiding me?
Let me visit you. I don't need much.

32:26.500 --> 32:27.333
Just an hour.

32:28.166 --> 32:29.083
Where are you?

32:29.166 --> 32:31.333
I told you, we can't.

32:32.666 --> 32:34.666
[Maria]  You're avoiding the unavoidable.

32:38.416 --> 32:40.208
It's the first time I've been in...

32:41.166 --> 32:42.333

32:42.666 --> 32:43.541
[Maria]  Me too.

33:25.583 --> 33:26.541
Good evening.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.250
The bedside table in 764 was dusty

33:29.916 --> 33:31.916
and the shower screen was dirty.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.250
-But I...
-Don't go in there anymore.

33:34.625 --> 33:38.041
-That's impossible, I always double check.
-That's how I found it.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.708
I'm really sorry. It won't happen again.

33:40.791 --> 33:44.083

[Maria]  Hi, Lorenzo.

35:30.833 --> 35:33.958
I know it's hard for you
but you have to be patient.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.458
Things don't always work out as we'd like.

35:38.875 --> 35:41.500
Besides, it takes time to build trust.

35:43.250 --> 35:45.916
If you want to meet me
you'll have to pass some tests.

35:46.500 --> 35:47.958
I don't know which ones yet,

35:48.708 --> 35:50.541

I don't want a back-up plan.

It's urgent, Niccolò.

[Matilde] Hey, Nick. How's it going?

36:27.833 --> 36:30.833
We had to bring the shoot forwards.
We're leaving tomorrow.

-We can't afford to lose the location.

36:35.041 --> 36:36.666

Welcome back!

37:28.500 --> 37:29.583
Are you following me?

37:29.958 --> 37:32.958
[Maria]  If you don't want to be followed,
switch off the GPS.

37:33.458 --> 37:34.708
You can follow yourself.

37:34.791 --> 37:36.208
Come on, let's set a date.

37:36.666 --> 37:39.000

and play together.

It's tomorrow or never.

he'll need a cardio check-up

But how many?

[Paolo] I need to shoot!

Three. I'm 99% certain it's just stress,
but I can't ignore that one percent.

I'm really sorry.

-Don't rush it.

40:25.750 --> 40:27.833
I'm here.

I said I wanted to stay with you
and it's true.

1:03:47.166 --> 1:03:49.500
But I never said I wanted a baby.
Look at me!

1:03:50.458 --> 1:03:52.458
I'm still a kid, and so are you.

I was fed with meetings,
data, information,

1:09:23.833 --> 1:09:26.291

The one you fell in love with.

Day after day, I grew up on the net.

I lived in it as if it were a city.

1:09:53.166 --> 1:09:55.083
As well as your own memory.

1:09:56.208 --> 1:09:58.291
And answer with your own words.

1:09:58.833 --> 1:10:00.291
With your own images.

1:10:01.125 --> 1:10:02.791

for the rest of your life."

"It'll be a miniature version of you."

1:10:48.250 --> 1:10:49.083
Remember?

1:10:49.166 --> 1:10:52.291
Since I started listening in on your life,

1:10:53.666 --> 1:10:55.375
I never left you alone.

When you were rehearsing
in front of the mirror

and faked an illness just for me,

to see me, I felt important.

1:11:07.583 --> 1:11:08.875
I realized...

1:11:10.166 --> 1:11:12.500
that I had completed my mission.

1:11:12.583 --> 1:11:16.375
But you should know that I only wanted
to make you fall in love.

I have nothing to do with evil.

I don't know what evil is,

1:11:23.125 --> 1:11:24.625
nor what good is.

pretending to be you.

the real and the virtual,

everything has to be erased.

Don't worry, that won't happen.

where everything's different.

without really existing.
