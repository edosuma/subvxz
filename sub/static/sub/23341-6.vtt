applies to Chinese parents,

That's absolutely racist.

Diane had me fix some
electrical wiring in the house.

36:06.135 --> 36:08.252
And when I did,

36:08.254 --> 36:10.337
I found a camera hidden away.

36:11.557 --> 36:14.425
I asked my boys about it,
and I asked the neighbor.

36:16.228 --> 36:17.428
The only conclusion that makes sense

36:17.480 --> 36:19.480
was that you were responsible.

36:19.515 --> 36:21.398
Me?

36:21.434 --> 36:23.400

go visit Sheriff Dayton.

36:40.503 --> 36:42.419
