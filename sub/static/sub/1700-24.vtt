WEBVTT

00:02.752 --> 00:04.795
Here's little Ben nodding off.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.840
Aww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy.

00:08.048 --> 00:11.593
- Look, he's got Ross' haircut.
- Oh, let me see.

00:12.262 --> 00:15.222
Oh, God!
Is he just the sweetest thing?

00:15.432 --> 00:18.475
You must just want
to kiss him all over.

00:22.522 --> 00:24.481
That would be nice.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.318
- Pfft.
- Pardon?

00:28.528 --> 00:31.864
Nothing. Just a little extra air
in my mouth. Pfft.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.164
Hey, Chan, can you help me out here?
I promise I'll pay you back.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.417
Oh, yeah, right.
Including the waffles last week...

00:43.626 --> 00:45.252
...you now owe me...

00:45.462 --> 00:47.629
...17 jillion dollars.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.716
I will, really,
I'll pay you back this time.

00:50.925 --> 00:52.801
Where's the money coming from?

00:53.011 --> 00:56.555
I'm helping out at the NYU
Med School with some, uh, research.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.432
What kind of research?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.394
Uh, just, you know, science.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.730
Science.

01:06.691 --> 01:08.984
Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

01:11.237 --> 01:12.780
It's a fertility study.

01:14.365 --> 01:15.949
Joey...

01:16.159 --> 01:19.286
Please tell me you're only
donating your time.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.248
Come on, you guys.
It's not that big a deal.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.210
I just go down there
every other day...

01:26.419 --> 01:28.504
...and make my contribution
to the project.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.674
Hey, but at the end of two weeks,
I get $700!

01:32.884 --> 01:35.636
Wow, you're gonna be making money
hand over fist.

02:27.605 --> 02:30.232
Okay, we got the coleslaw.
We got the buns.

02:30.441 --> 02:34.611
We've got the ground-up flesh
of formally cute cows and turkeys.

02:36.447 --> 02:38.365
Men are here!

02:43.663 --> 02:45.581
We make fire.

02:47.292 --> 02:48.750
Cook meat.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.461
Then put out fire by peeing,
no get invited back!

02:52.213 --> 02:53.589
Cute, cute.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.675
- Oh, Melanie called. She's gonna be late.
- Oh, okay.

02:56.885 --> 02:58.552
So how are things going with you two?

02:58.761 --> 03:01.305
Is she becoming your special someone?

03:03.516 --> 03:05.767
I don't know. She's, uh...
She's pretty great.

03:05.977 --> 03:09.188
Yeah? What does she think of
your little science project?

03:11.065 --> 03:14.568
You think I'm gonna tell a girl I like
that I'm also seeing a cup?

03:18.615 --> 03:19.990
The man's got a point.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.869
Well, the tough thing is,
she really wants to have sex with me.

03:24.078 --> 03:26.288
Crazy bitch.

03:31.252 --> 03:34.880
I still got a week left in the program,
and according to the rules...

03:35.089 --> 03:39.009
...if I want to get the money, I'm not allowed
to conduct any personal experiments...

03:39.219 --> 03:42.846
...if you know what I mean.
- Joey, we always know what you mean.

03:49.687 --> 03:51.480
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.025
How long did you think
this barbecue was gonna last?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.610
I'm going to China.

03:56.819 --> 03:59.446
Jeez, you say one thing and, eh...

04:00.615 --> 04:01.823
You're going to China?

04:02.033 --> 04:04.785
It's, uh, for the museum.
Someone found a bone.

04:04.994 --> 04:07.120
We want the bone,
they don't want us to have it.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.458
So I'm going to try to persuade them...
It's a whole big "bone" thing.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.504
Anyway, I'm gonna be gone
for, like, a week.

04:15.713 --> 04:19.800
So, uh, if you wanna reach me,
you can't. So here's my itinerary.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.718
Um...

04:21.928 --> 04:24.638
- Here's a picture of me.
- Oh, let me see.

04:25.223 --> 04:29.393
Could you take it to Carol's now and then
and show it to Ben so he doesn't forget me?

04:29.602 --> 04:31.812
- Yeah.
- Hi, Ben.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.981
I'm your father.

04:36.150 --> 04:39.069
I am The Head! Pahh!

04:43.825 --> 04:45.534
This barbecue's gonna be very fun.

04:46.703 --> 04:50.580
Is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her
a happy birthday before I left.

04:50.790 --> 04:54.001
- Oh, no, she's out having drinks with Carl.
- Oh. Heh.

04:54.210 --> 04:55.961
Hey, who's Carl?

04:58.381 --> 05:00.799
- The guy she met at the coffeehouse?
- No.

05:01.009 --> 05:05.595
- See, there's this guy she met at...
- The coffeehouse? Right.

05:05.805 --> 05:08.932
So you do know who he is. Heh.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.104
I'm gonna go say goodbye
to the guys.

05:14.314 --> 05:17.190
Hey, you know what?
Tell them that bone story.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.405
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:23.614 --> 05:24.614
Hey.

05:24.824 --> 05:27.451
- I have to go to China.
- The country?

05:29.287 --> 05:32.539
No, this big pile of dishes
in my Mom's breakfront.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.084
Do you guys know who Carl is?

05:36.294 --> 05:39.421
Let's see. Alvin, Simon, Theodore...

05:39.630 --> 05:40.797
No.

05:41.924 --> 05:44.801
- Well, Rachel's having drinks with him.
- Oh, no!

05:45.011 --> 05:47.554
How can she, when she's never
shown interest in you?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.891
Forget about her.

05:51.100 --> 05:55.145
He's right, man. Please move on.
Go to China. Eat Chinese food.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.190
Of course, there they just call it food.

05:58.983 --> 06:02.277
Yeah? I guess. I don't know.

06:03.112 --> 06:06.406
All right, just give her this
for me, okay?

06:06.616 --> 06:08.450
Listen, we're just looking out for you.

06:08.659 --> 06:10.160
- I know.
- We want you to be happy.

06:10.370 --> 06:14.247
And I may only have a couple beers
in me, but I love you, man.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.668
I'm still on my first.

06:21.631 --> 06:23.298
I just think you're nice.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.393
Anyway, that's when me and my friends
started this fruit-basket business.

06:34.602 --> 06:39.189
We call ourselves
"The Three Basketeers." Ha, ha.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.275
Like "The Three Musketeers,"
only with fruit.

06:43.778 --> 06:44.986
Oh!

06:46.030 --> 06:47.280
Okay.

06:49.117 --> 06:52.160
- How do you like your burgers?
- No. Presents first, food later!

06:54.330 --> 06:55.455
Hold on there, tiger.

06:56.290 --> 06:57.833
How's it going?
How you holding up?

06:58.042 --> 06:59.543
Well, not so good.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.130
She thinks tonight's the night
we're gonna complete the transaction...

07:03.339 --> 07:04.714
...if you know what I...

07:04.924 --> 07:06.383
And you do. Heh.

07:07.009 --> 07:10.220
So, uh, have you ever thought about
being there for her?

07:10.638 --> 07:12.222
What do you mean?

07:16.060 --> 07:18.728
You know, just be there for her.

07:21.399 --> 07:22.941
Not following you.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.155
Think about it.

07:32.952 --> 07:38.373
Okay, I'm guessing this is from...

07:41.210 --> 07:43.170
Well, thank you, Melanie.

07:43.504 --> 07:45.964
- Okay, this one right here is from me.
- Okay.

07:46.174 --> 07:47.757
Hmm. Ah, it's light.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.303
It rattles. It's...

07:53.014 --> 07:56.600
...Travel Scrabble.
- Ha, ha, hey!

07:57.226 --> 08:00.187
Wow. Thank you.

08:04.066 --> 08:05.317
This one's from Joey.

08:05.526 --> 08:10.405
It feels like a book. I think it's a book.
Feels like a book. And it's a book!

08:10.615 --> 08:12.407
It's Dr. Seuss!

08:13.659 --> 08:15.827
That book got me through
some tough times.

08:17.788 --> 08:20.373
There is a little child
inside this man.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.502
The doctors say if they remove it,
he'll die.

08:26.547 --> 08:28.507
- Who's this from?
- That's, uh, Ross'.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.966
Ah.

08:34.804 --> 08:36.556
Oh, my God.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.892
He remembered.

08:39.101 --> 08:40.309
Remembered what?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.229
It was, like, months ago.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.941
We were walking by this antique store,
and I saw this pin in the window.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.819
I told him it was just like one
my grandmother had when I was little.

08:50.029 --> 08:53.365
Aw! I can't believe he remembered!

08:53.574 --> 08:57.160
Well, sure, but can you
play it on a plane?

09:01.290 --> 09:04.251
Oh, it's so pretty.

09:04.460 --> 09:07.420
- This must've cost him a fortune.
- I can't believe he did this.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.965
Ross? Remember when he
fell in love with Carol...

09:10.174 --> 09:13.593
...and bought her that ridiculously
expensive crystal duck?

09:14.887 --> 09:16.555
What did you just say?

09:28.609 --> 09:30.026
Crystal duck.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.533
No, no, no.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.911
The, um... The "love" part?

09:46.377 --> 09:49.379
Oh, my God.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.799
Oh, no, no, no, no.

09:53.009 --> 09:55.302
That's good.
Just keep rubbing your head.

09:55.511 --> 09:57.971
That'll turn back time.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.771
This is unbelievable.
I mean, this is unbelievable.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.649
I know. This is really, really huge.

10:09.859 --> 10:14.321
No, it's not. It's small,
it's tiny, it's petite, it's wee.

10:14.780 --> 10:19.534
Uh-uh. I don't think any of our lives
will ever be the same ever again.

10:20.911 --> 10:23.496
Is there a mute button on this woman?

10:23.706 --> 10:27.125
I think this is so great!
I mean, you and Ross!

10:27.335 --> 10:30.587
- Did you have any idea?
- No, none.

10:30.796 --> 10:34.090
My first night in the city,
he mentioned asking me out...

10:34.300 --> 10:36.760
...but nothing ever happened,
so I just...

10:36.969 --> 10:40.138
What else did he say?
Does he want to go out with me?

10:40.348 --> 10:42.515
Given that he's desperately
in love with you...

10:42.725 --> 10:45.810
...he wouldn't mind getting
a cup of coffee or something.

10:46.562 --> 10:47.771
Ross?

10:48.481 --> 10:50.106
All this time?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.692
- I've gotta talk to him.
- He's in China!

10:52.902 --> 10:54.027
The country.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.615
Wait, his flight doesn't leave
for 45 minutes.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.409
What about the time difference?
From here to the airport?

11:01.619 --> 11:02.661
Yes!

11:04.038 --> 11:06.539
- You're never gonna make it!
- I've got to try.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.667
What are you gonna say to him?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.168
I don't know.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.836
Maybe you shouldn't go.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.923
Right, because if you're gonna
break his heart, that can wait.

11:15.132 --> 11:17.759
Yeah, but if it's good news, tell him now.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.469
Maybe I'll know when I see him.

11:19.679 --> 11:22.180
Here, look. All right, does this help?

11:28.771 --> 11:30.021
No.

11:30.231 --> 11:34.192
All I know is, I cannot wait a week.
This is just too big.

11:34.402 --> 11:36.820
I've just got to talk to him. I've got...

11:37.029 --> 11:39.406
- I'll see you later.
- I love you!

11:40.783 --> 11:42.283
Deal with me first!

11:54.755 --> 11:55.755
All right.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.886
Ross! Ross.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.179
Excuse me, pardon me.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.848
- Hi. Your boarding pass?
- Hi.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.891
No, I need to talk to my friend.

12:07.101 --> 12:11.062
Sorry, you're not allowed on the jetway
unless you have a boarding pass.

12:11.272 --> 12:14.482
He just went on. He's right there,
in the blue jacket! Can I just...?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.651
I'm sorry. Federal regulations!

12:16.861 --> 12:20.864
All right, um, then could you please
just give him a message for me?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.615
Please? This is very important.

12:22.825 --> 12:25.160
All right. What's the message?

12:25.494 --> 12:27.871
Uh... I don't know.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.792
Excuse me! Sir!
Excuse me! Sir?

12:33.002 --> 12:34.919
- I have a message for you.
- What?

12:35.129 --> 12:39.007
It's from Rachel. She loved the present.
She'll see you when you get back.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.925
What?

12:41.969 --> 12:45.054
Toby, I don't know
what she's talking about.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.765
There's no Rachel!

12:46.974 --> 12:49.142
Don't give me that deep freeze!

12:58.527 --> 13:02.280
Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey!

13:03.032 --> 13:06.034
I think I blacked out there
for a minute.

13:07.661 --> 13:09.162
It was nothing.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.958
Well, now we gotta
find something fun for you!

13:17.379 --> 13:19.672
Ahh, you know what?

13:20.966 --> 13:24.594
Forget about me. Let's, uh...
Let's give you another turn.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.431
Me, again?

13:28.641 --> 13:30.975
Sure. Why not?

13:33.646 --> 13:38.483
Boy! Somebody's gonna get
a big fruit basket tomorrow!

13:43.489 --> 13:48.201
I gotta tell you, you are nothing like
I thought you would be.

13:48.410 --> 13:49.744
How do you mean?

13:49.954 --> 13:54.290
I just had you pegged as one of those
guys who are always, "Me, me, me!"

13:54.500 --> 13:56.042
- Ha, ha.
- But you...

13:56.961 --> 13:58.253
...you're a giver.

13:59.630 --> 14:02.048
You're, like, the most generous
man I ever met.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.718
I mean, you're practically a woman.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.894
So, uh, Rach, do you want to save
this wrapping paper?

14:15.104 --> 14:16.396
It's only a little torn.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.941
Are you gonna go for it with Ross,
or should I throw it out?

14:22.778 --> 14:26.030
I don't know.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.200
Thought about it
all of the way there...

14:29.410 --> 14:32.579
...and I thought about it
all the way back and, uh...

14:32.788 --> 14:34.539
You know, it's Ross!

14:34.748 --> 14:37.041
You know what I mean? It's Ross.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.877
- Sure!
- Sure.

14:39.336 --> 14:44.007
I don't know. This is just
my initial gut feeling...

14:45.009 --> 14:46.885
...but I'm thinking...

14:47.887 --> 14:49.053
...it'd be really great.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.849
Oh, my God, me too!
Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law!

14:54.268 --> 14:57.312
The best part is you already
know everything about him.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.647
It's like starting on the 15th date.

14:59.857 --> 15:03.318
But it would be like
starting on the 15th date.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.112
Another good point.

15:06.322 --> 15:07.906
No, I mean...

15:08.115 --> 15:12.535
At the 15th date, you're already
in a "relationship-y" place.

15:12.745 --> 15:13.953
You're committed.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.040
Huh.

15:17.499 --> 15:19.834
What happens if it doesn't work out?

15:20.044 --> 15:23.046
- Why isn't it working out?
- I don't know, sometimes it doesn't.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.966
Is he not cute enough for you?
Does he not make enough money?

15:27.176 --> 15:29.344
- No, I'm just...
- Maybe there's someone else.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.221
Is there? Is there someone else?

15:32.431 --> 15:35.600
- No, there is no one else.
- Then why the hell...

15:35.809 --> 15:38.186
...are you dumping my brother?
- Wha...?

15:48.572 --> 15:49.989
- Hey, big...
- Shh!

15:50.199 --> 15:51.908
Spender.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.745
She's still asleep.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.456
- So how'd it go?
- It was amazing.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.708
You know how you think
you're great in bed?

16:00.918 --> 16:04.587
The fact you'd even ask
shows how little you know me.

16:05.089 --> 16:07.882
Well, it's like,
last night I couldn't do the thing...

16:08.092 --> 16:10.009
...that usually makes me great.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.345
So I had to do all this other stuff.

16:12.554 --> 16:15.598
And the response I got! Man, oh, man.

16:15.808 --> 16:17.976
It was like a ticker-tape parade!

16:20.020 --> 16:23.564
Yes I know. As it happens, my room
is very close to the parade route.

16:29.363 --> 16:33.032
It was amazing, and not just for her.
Uh-uh. For me too.

16:33.242 --> 16:36.327
It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind...

16:36.537 --> 16:38.705
...but all my other senses
are heightened.

16:38.914 --> 16:42.542
You know? It's like,
I was able to appreciate it...

16:42.751 --> 16:44.794
...on another level.

16:47.423 --> 16:49.841
I didn't know you had another level.

16:50.384 --> 16:52.176
I know. Neither did I!

17:01.687 --> 17:03.938
- Hey, great skirts! Birthday present?
- Yeah.

17:04.147 --> 17:05.732
- From who?
- From you.

17:05.941 --> 17:08.067
I exchanged the blouse you got me.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.362
Well, it's the thought.

17:12.196 --> 17:14.699
Doesn't Ross' flight get in
in a couple hours?

17:14.950 --> 17:16.742
At gate 27B?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.871
Uh, yeah.

17:20.079 --> 17:22.540
Monica, you know,
I've been thinking about it.

17:22.750 --> 17:26.127
I've decided this Ross thing
is not a good idea.

17:26.336 --> 17:28.171
- Why?
- Because I feel...

17:28.380 --> 17:30.923
...like I wouldn't
just be going out with him.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.217
I would be going out with all of you.

17:33.427 --> 17:37.013
- Ugh, there'd be all this pressure and...
- No pressure, no pressure!

17:38.807 --> 17:41.809
Nothing has even happened yet
and you're already so...

17:42.019 --> 17:43.352
I'm not "so."

17:43.562 --> 17:45.772
I was a teensy bit weird at first...

17:45.981 --> 17:48.858
...but I'll be good. I promise.

17:54.114 --> 17:55.156
Who is it?

17:55.365 --> 17:56.699
It's me, Carl.

17:56.909 --> 17:57.992
Come on up.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.952
Behind my brother's back?

18:01.538 --> 18:05.249
Is the kind of crazy thing
you won't be hearing from me.

18:18.847 --> 18:22.141
- Seven hundred bucks.
- All right, you did it.

18:22.351 --> 18:23.726
Do we have any fruit?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.815
Man, hell of a two weeks, huh?

18:29.024 --> 18:32.026
You know what, though?
I really feel I learned something.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.862
So you'll stick with this
"it's all for her" thing?

18:35.072 --> 18:36.864
What, are you crazy?

18:37.074 --> 18:41.452
When a blind man gets his sight back,
does he walk around like this?

18:46.917 --> 18:50.294
I'm just saying, if I see one more
picture of Ed Begley Jr...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.547
...in that stupid electric car...

18:52.756 --> 18:54.257
...I'm gonna shoot myself!

18:56.468 --> 19:00.221
Don't get me wrong. I'm not against
environmental issues, per se...

19:00.430 --> 19:02.181
...it's just that guy!

19:02.391 --> 19:06.602
I can't believe you'd rather
go out with him than me.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.022
Excuse me, please.
I'm trying to have a date here.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.692
Fine, just stop thinking about me.

19:16.196 --> 19:18.406
Can't do it, can you?

19:19.241 --> 19:21.534
So I'm thinking about you.
So what?

19:21.827 --> 19:24.954
I don't get it. What do you see
in this guy anyway?

19:25.164 --> 19:28.541
Well, he seems to be
a very nice guy.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.878
I mean, come on, buddy!
Get a real car!

19:35.090 --> 19:38.593
Rachel, come on. Give us a chance.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.220
- Ross, it's too hard.
- No, no.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.347
Because it'll get weird
for everyone else?

19:43.557 --> 19:45.725
Who cares about them? This is about us.

19:45.934 --> 19:49.437
I've been in love with you
since the ninth grade.

19:49.646 --> 19:52.190
- You're, like, my best friend.
- I know.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.358
- If we broke up, and I lost you...
- Whoa.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.402
Why do you think we'll break up?

19:56.612 --> 20:00.489
Have you been involved with someone
where you haven't broken up?

20:03.035 --> 20:04.702
No.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.623
But it only has to happen once.

20:08.957 --> 20:12.001
You and I know
we are perfect for each other.

20:12.294 --> 20:13.419
Right?

20:13.629 --> 20:17.298
So the only question is:
Are you attracted to me?

20:19.384 --> 20:21.219
I don't know.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.765
I mean, I've never looked at you
that way before.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.142
Well start looking.

20:38.612 --> 20:39.654
Wow.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.072
Exactly!

20:41.281 --> 20:43.199
And you just know
I'm gonna be the guy...

20:43.408 --> 20:46.369
...caught behind this hammerhead
in traffic!

20:48.997 --> 20:50.206
- Right.
- Heh.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.083
You're right.

20:52.459 --> 20:53.542
- You know what?
- What?

20:53.919 --> 20:57.046
I forgot, I'm supposed to pick up
a friend at the airport.

20:57.256 --> 20:59.382
I am so sorry. I'm so...

20:59.591 --> 21:02.969
If you want to stay
and finish your drinks, please do.

21:03.178 --> 21:05.596
I'm sorry, I gotta go. I'm sorry.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.515
But...

21:16.984 --> 21:18.943
Excuse me! Pardon me! Excuse me.

21:19.152 --> 21:20.778
I'm sorry. Ha, ha.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.823
Toby, for God's sake, will you let it go?

21:24.032 --> 21:25.783
There's no Rachel!

21:30.622 --> 21:33.791
- Oh, hey. I got that.
- Oh.

21:34.001 --> 21:36.502
- Thanks, sweetie.
- No problem.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.760
I cannot wait
for you to meet my friends.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.513
Really? You don't think
they'll judge and ridicule me?

21:47.723 --> 21:49.515
No, they will. I just, uh...

21:49.725 --> 21:51.017
- Can't wait. Heh.
- Can't wait.

21:51.226 --> 21:52.768
Come on, they're gonna love you.
