00:39.785 --> 00:42.951
What are you doing back?
We can't go over this again.

00:42.985 --> 00:45.753
Go home. Get some sleep.

01:02.365 --> 01:06.268
It is so weird watching
your mother try to rebound.

01:06.302 --> 01:09.738
Well, taking care of her
appearance is a good sign, actually.

01:09.772 --> 01:12.273
She's flirting with
everything that moves.

01:13.275 --> 01:14.875
Did she tell you why
Cavanaugh broke it off?

01:14.909 --> 01:17.478
- No.
- I wish she'd talk about it.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.614
Do you know the average woman ingests

01:19.615 --> 01:21.716
7 pounds of lipstick over a lifetime?

01:21.750 --> 01:25.453
Why do you insist on telling me
your disgusting fun facts over food?

01:25.488 --> 01:26.587
It's coffee.

01:26.622 --> 01:28.623
- Hiya, doll!
- Hi!

01:28.657 --> 01:30.058
Hallo Detective.

01:30.092 --> 01:32.960
Of all the knuckleheads
she's gonna flirt with ...

01:32.995 --> 01:34.562
she has to flirt with
Lightning McQueen?

01:34.596 --> 01:36.931
I thought his name was Detective Gibson.

01:36.965 --> 01:39.733
I believe he's part of
the auto-theft task force.

01:39.768 --> 01:41.936
That explains why he's so arrogant.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.037
Watch this. Watch.

01:43.071 --> 01:46.573
If you were a car,
you'd be a '68 Dodge Charger ...

01:46.641 --> 01:48.841
sleek styling, great street performance.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.012
Hey, Detective. I was, uh,
I was just telling your mother

01:53.046 --> 01:56.515
about this, uh, '68 Dodge
Charger we recovered.

01:56.550 --> 01:58.150
Really?

01:58.185 --> 02:00.286
I thought you were about to
compliment her on her trunk space.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.587
Jane!

02:01.622 --> 02:02.788
Good morning, Lieutenant.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.493
What's good about it?

02:07.862 --> 02:11.130
So... Rich, I guess
you'll have your usual.

02:11.165 --> 02:13.666
Angela, how can you know me so well?

02:18.172 --> 02:20.406
Now she's trying to
make Cavanaugh jealous?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.975
Jealousy can sometimes be
a sign of love or commitment.

02:23.010 --> 02:25.111
It can also be a sign
that Lightning McQueen

02:25.145 --> 02:26.679
is about to get his ass kicked.

02:26.713 --> 02:31.016
- So, I'll be seeing you, beautiful.
- Okay. Bye, Rich.

02:31.050 --> 02:33.418
- I will call you.
- Okay.

02:33.453 --> 02:35.320
Hey, Mrs. Rizzoli, if
you're not too busy,

02:35.354 --> 02:36.821
can I get some coffee over here?

02:36.855 --> 02:39.123
Right away, Lieutenant.

02:40.592 --> 02:43.727
- I can't watch any more.
- We have to do something.

02:43.761 --> 02:46.296
What?
Hide all the plastic knives?

02:49.433 --> 02:50.433
Vanilla.

02:52.068 --> 02:54.236
Just who I was looking for.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.938
- I thought you wanted some coffee.
- Uh, never mind.

03:00.108 --> 03:03.209
Hello, Mr. Rondo.
Who do we have here?

03:03.244 --> 03:05.912
Reuben, Dania, Trevor.

03:05.946 --> 03:07.479
It's Dawg.

03:07.514 --> 03:09.981
Oh. How do you do, Dawg?

03:10.015 --> 03:11.916
Rondo, aren't we
a little old for playdates?

03:11.950 --> 03:14.251
These are all my homies
from "off the street."

03:14.286 --> 03:17.988
- Oh. The home for teenagers?
- I volunteer there.

03:18.023 --> 03:19.923
- We're "Rondo's rejects."
- Mm-hmm.

03:19.957 --> 03:21.189
Um...

03:22.290 --> 03:24.924
Perhaps you'd consider
a less pejorative name.

03:24.958 --> 03:28.358
Juveniles often identify with
the labels society gives them.

03:28.392 --> 03:31.627
Oh, society didn't name them.
They named their own selves.

03:31.662 --> 03:32.662
Hmm.

03:32.696 --> 03:37.199
Um, a reject is a person or thing
dismissed as failing to meet standards ...

03:37.233 --> 03:38.333
Maura.

03:38.367 --> 03:41.302
"Pejorative" is a word that
expresses contempt or disapproval.

03:42.904 --> 03:46.606
Brought 'em by to meet my heroes...
a little impromptu "career day."

03:46.640 --> 03:48.040
Wow. So you guys want to be cops?

03:48.075 --> 03:50.209
No. No way.

03:50.243 --> 03:51.943
They just need a little mentoring.

03:51.978 --> 03:54.145
Maybe you could...
take 'em around a little?

03:54.180 --> 03:57.381
I-I could be a mentor, too.
Does anybody like cooking?

03:57.416 --> 03:58.416
Cooking!

04:00.051 --> 04:01.651
- Or science?
- Science!

04:05.322 --> 04:07.856
Okay, Ma, why don't you
give them a doughnut,

04:07.891 --> 04:09.358
and we'll let you be on your way?

04:09.392 --> 04:10.592
Fine by me.

04:10.627 --> 04:12.594
Right? I ain't being
mentored by no chick, anyway.

04:16.331 --> 04:20.466
You know, now that I think about it,
we love to mentor here.

04:20.502 --> 04:24.304
And we can find a boy Detective,
if that's what you'd prefer.

04:24.339 --> 04:27.807
Detective Frost could be your mentor.

04:27.842 --> 04:29.909
And Sergeant Korsak
could be your mentor.

04:29.944 --> 04:31.644
If I have to have a mentor,

04:31.679 --> 04:33.479
I'd rather it be someone
with an advanced degree.

04:33.514 --> 04:35.581
- I have an M.D.
- Okay, I guess.

04:35.615 --> 04:37.182
You got anything to eat?

04:39.185 --> 04:41.086
Okay, Ma, we got to go.
We got a case.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.455
All right, come on.
I'll make you all breakfast.

04:45.993 --> 04:48.527
Frankie!
Come here!

04:49.963 --> 04:52.331
- I need you to do something.
- You got a big case?

04:52.366 --> 04:54.066
You see those teenagers over there?

04:54.101 --> 04:56.936
Run their names ... make sure
they haven't killed anybody.

04:56.971 --> 04:59.339
You mean the ones
standing 6 inches from Ma?

04:59.373 --> 05:02.075
You probably shouldn't let
them out of your sight, either.

05:22.115 --> 05:24.776
<b>3x13 - Virtual Love</b>

05:28.536 --> 05:30.571
Where would Luke Skywalker
be without Yoda?

05:30.605 --> 05:32.372
Or the Karate Kid without Mr. Miyagi?

05:32.407 --> 05:34.875
Okay, I said I would do it.
I'll be a mentor.

05:34.909 --> 05:38.045
Agnodice was the first female
gynecologist in ancient Athens.

05:38.079 --> 05:39.446
She was one of mentors.

05:39.514 --> 05:42.583
You mean when you time-traveled
back to the 1st century?

05:42.617 --> 05:47.554
3rd century B.C. Marie Curie was
also a big influencer of mine.

05:47.589 --> 05:50.524
- Who were your mentors?
- Uh, police woman, Kojak...

05:50.558 --> 05:52.592
Oh! Jim Rockford.

05:54.028 --> 05:55.128
What was he cooking?

05:55.163 --> 05:56.797
- Beer.
- Beer?

05:56.831 --> 05:59.266
He's a microbrewer.
This is his test kitchen.

05:59.300 --> 06:03.704
Victim is Greg Jensen, C.E.O.
and brewmaster of Overlord Ale.

06:03.738 --> 06:07.207
- Who found the body?
- Jensen's assistant, ruby Burke.

06:07.241 --> 06:09.876
- She found him this morning.
- ...and then I came back, and...

06:09.911 --> 06:11.144
She have an alibi?

06:11.179 --> 06:13.814
Yeah, she was in Scandinavia
for the last month.

06:13.848 --> 06:17.184
She was selling her
boss's Viking-themed beer.

06:17.218 --> 06:19.153
She flew in
from Reykjavik this morning.

06:19.187 --> 06:20.888
When was he killed?

06:20.922 --> 06:23.190
He's been dead at least eight hours.

06:23.225 --> 06:25.226
- Sweet poster girl.
- No kidding.

06:25.260 --> 06:27.461
- Uh, gentlemen?
- Huh?

06:27.496 --> 06:29.063
Do we have any suspects?

06:29.097 --> 06:31.232
Oh, victim's married.
Wife's been notified.

06:31.266 --> 06:33.234
Says she was home taking
care of their two young kids.

06:33.268 --> 06:38.007
- We're bringing her in.
- 2.5-centimeter round hole.

06:38.041 --> 06:41.210
Hmm.
That's a very unusual entrance wound.

06:41.244 --> 06:44.179
- What was he stabbed with?
- Not a knife.

06:44.214 --> 06:46.349
Are we playing
"process of elimination" again?

06:46.383 --> 06:47.517
Yes.

06:47.551 --> 06:51.588
It's not a garbage disposal,
cleaver, pitchfork, pinking shears...

06:51.623 --> 06:53.290
Uh, ladies?

06:54.893 --> 06:55.593
Right.

06:55.627 --> 07:00.666
Ah. But this...
appears to be a metal rivet.

07:02.969 --> 07:05.404
Maybe it came off the murder weapon.

07:08.409 --> 07:12.413
There's some blood droplets...

07:16.318 --> 07:18.186
...leading into that mill.

07:23.328 --> 07:26.264
I think we just found what's
left of our murder weapon.

07:30.796 --> 07:33.556
The trace confirmed that the blood on
the stick belonged to Jensen.

07:33.591 --> 07:35.926
You think a sharpened stick
could do that kind of damage?

07:35.960 --> 07:39.829
Yeah.
Doesn't explain the metal rivet, though.

07:39.864 --> 07:41.935
<i>Hey. Jane.</i>

07:43.601 --> 07:44.801
Oh, my g...
Frankie, I'm so sorry.

07:44.836 --> 07:46.036
Oh, no problem.

07:46.104 --> 07:48.505
I've been having a barrel
of laughs with your mentees.

07:48.540 --> 07:49.573
Who has mentees?

07:49.607 --> 07:50.774
Um... you.

07:52.177 --> 07:53.477
And you.

07:53.511 --> 07:56.246
Apparently, Maura and Jane
volunteered all of us ...

07:56.281 --> 07:57.981
Toured booking, properties.

07:58.016 --> 08:00.450
I was just about to show them
how I write a traffic ticket.

08:00.485 --> 08:03.320
This is snore-ville... population, you.

08:04.989 --> 08:06.623
They're all yours.

08:09.694 --> 08:11.294
- Hey.
- Hello.

08:11.329 --> 08:15.599
Hi! Please...
don't play with that.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.000
Why you got a doll, man?

08:17.035 --> 08:19.336
I was wondering if I could
go see the medical examiner,

08:19.370 --> 08:20.637
maybe check out an autopsy?

08:20.672 --> 08:23.173
- Uh... no.
- Why not?

08:23.208 --> 08:24.675
'Cause it's not on the itinerary.

08:24.710 --> 08:28.012
- I'm taking A.P. Bio, so ...
- Advanced-placement biology?

08:28.046 --> 08:30.081
- Yeah.
- What, you think a reject kid can't be smart?

08:30.149 --> 08:32.918
At least reject kids
don't play with dolls.

08:32.985 --> 08:35.654
Wait. I bet you call him an
action figure, right, bro?

08:38.058 --> 08:42.796
Yes, and if you touch my "action
figure" again, I will break your face.

08:42.830 --> 08:45.966
If I could observe an autopsy,
it'd count for extra credit.

08:46.550 --> 08:48.251
Okay, fine.

08:49.571 --> 08:53.874
But you need to have your parents
sign this liability release waiver.

08:55.244 --> 08:58.345
- No, Dania, your parents got to ...
- It's legal. I'm emancipated.

08:58.379 --> 09:00.681
My mom's dead,
and my dad's in prison.

09:00.715 --> 09:03.450
If you don't believe me,
here are my documents.

09:04.452 --> 09:05.586
Okay. Come on.

09:05.620 --> 09:07.888
W-w-w-w-wait. We want
to see dead bodies, too.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.589
Yeah.
Better than this bullshit.

09:09.624 --> 09:10.923
Oh, shoot.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.760
I bet you wish you picked
the "chick" Detective now.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.528
Sorry, fellas.

09:18.932 --> 09:21.167
<i>Cover him up.</i>

09:23.437 --> 09:26.906
<i>Cover him up, Maura.
Cover him up.</i>

09:28.642 --> 09:32.378
- Hi.
- You're about to do the "y" incision?

09:32.412 --> 09:36.016
Yes!
And do you know why the "y," Dania?

09:36.050 --> 09:37.951
To facilitate the removal
of the breastplate.

09:37.985 --> 09:40.787
- Go ahead. Do it.
- Uh... no.

09:40.821 --> 09:42.889
Our release form doesn't
cover slicing and dicing.

09:42.924 --> 09:44.591
You said I could check out an autopsy.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.725
I didn't say which part.

09:45.760 --> 09:50.863
Okay, so, the first thing
that I do is examine the body.

09:50.898 --> 09:52.732
Does your release form cover gloves?

09:52.766 --> 09:53.666
Yes.

09:58.405 --> 10:00.974
All right.
Do you notice anything?

10:01.008 --> 10:04.343
His leg's a little swollen,
but I don't see an injury.

10:04.378 --> 10:05.545
You're very observant.

10:05.579 --> 10:07.947
You think it could be
deep-vein thrombosis?

10:08.516 --> 10:10.417
I read about this war correspondent

10:10.451 --> 10:12.919
who died from sitting in
one place for too long.

10:12.954 --> 10:16.123
Better be careful, Maura.
I think we found your replacement.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.291
Can I see the wound?

10:19.527 --> 10:22.763
- What kind of weapon did that?
- I'm not sure.

10:22.798 --> 10:27.101
But the ragged wound edges suggest
some kind of a barbed blade.

10:27.136 --> 10:28.770
Detective, can you help
me turn him on his side?

10:28.804 --> 10:29.805
Yeah, sure.

10:31.407 --> 10:32.374
Okay.

10:32.408 --> 10:34.342
There we go.

10:34.377 --> 10:38.380
We'll take a closer look
with the fluoroscope.

10:38.414 --> 10:39.881
Huh.

10:39.916 --> 10:42.350
There's something lodged near T-8.

10:42.485 --> 10:45.253
Looks like some kind of spear tip.

10:57.499 --> 11:00.501
It looks like an iron krokspjot.

11:00.535 --> 11:03.503
Aha! Just as I suspected ...
a crockpot.

11:03.538 --> 11:08.341
Krokspjots like this
were used during the Viking era.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.713
Oh. I think these are rune
letters carved into the metal.

11:12.747 --> 11:16.517
The runic alphabet is an ancient
nordic one that predates latin.

11:16.551 --> 11:18.118
Can you read what it says?

11:18.153 --> 11:20.621
No. I'll have to
consult a Runic scholar.

11:20.655 --> 11:24.358
Well, Greg Jensen sold
Viking-themed beer.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.693
Maybe the spear tip came from
his brewery or his office.

11:31.499 --> 11:35.068
Okay, Frost and Korsak have
a lead on a possible suspect.

11:35.102 --> 11:36.269
Come on, Dania.

11:36.336 --> 11:38.070
Cool. Can I watch you
intimidate the suspect?

11:38.105 --> 11:39.405
No. But hurry.

11:39.439 --> 11:42.508
I don't want you to miss
my mother's cooking class.

11:43.576 --> 11:46.044
Thank your mom for that cooking class.

11:46.078 --> 11:48.646
Dawg and Reuben almost got
slapped upside the head.

11:48.681 --> 11:50.482
Korsak, you were gonna hit your mentees?

11:50.516 --> 11:54.719
Not me ... Frost.
Mr. Chill can't take teen 'tude.

11:56.088 --> 11:58.423
Take a look at this.

11:58.457 --> 12:02.627
That is the Overlord Ale logo.
But look at this.

12:05.631 --> 12:08.933
Why would a brother want to
be in a nordic motorcycle gang?

12:08.968 --> 12:12.903
Ragnarok Riders is a motorcycle
club. It's not a gang, Frost.

12:13.638 --> 12:18.008
Well, the motorcycle-club logo
is similar to Overlord Ale.

12:18.042 --> 12:22.212
Don't tell me our victim
lifted a motorcycle club's logo.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.382
It gets worse.
See the sexy Viking poster girl?

12:25.416 --> 12:27.817
- Yes.
- Meet Sophie West.

12:27.852 --> 12:31.588
Here she is with her daddy.

12:31.622 --> 12:34.725
Clark "Skull Crusher" West ...
head of the Ragnarok Riders.

12:34.759 --> 12:37.794
He sued Greg Jensen, claiming
copyright infringement.

12:37.829 --> 12:40.097
Yeah, 'cause he couldn't sue
for daughter infringement.

12:40.131 --> 12:44.067
Jensen paid Sophie
to be the model for Overlord Ale.

12:44.102 --> 12:49.039
- Daddy sued over the logo and lost.
- The guy's a sore loser.

12:50.342 --> 12:52.376
<i>Hey, you watch yourself, pencil neck.</i>

12:52.410 --> 12:54.678
<i>You watch your back.
This battle isn't over.</i>

12:55.914 --> 12:57.949
Oh, I think we should
pay Skull Crusher a visit.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.621
That's not a drill.
Nothing's scheduled today.

13:03.656 --> 13:05.690
Get the hell out of here, people!

13:05.758 --> 13:09.195
Let's move ... now!
Go!

13:10.730 --> 13:12.998
I left my mask from Nairobi inside.

13:13.033 --> 13:14.667
I left my lucky notepad.

13:14.701 --> 13:17.103
I should've
grabbed my swiss lithographs.

13:18.171 --> 13:19.872
Look at this building.
Do you see any smoke?

13:19.940 --> 13:21.373
No.

13:21.441 --> 13:24.176
And does your super-sniffer
nose smell any smoke?

13:24.211 --> 13:25.344
No.

13:25.379 --> 13:27.447
I think one of Rondo's
rejects pulled the fire alarm

13:27.481 --> 13:29.549
to get out of Ma's
"fun with fresh produce" lecture.

13:31.018 --> 13:34.087
All right, everybody.
Some joker pulled the fire alarm.

13:34.121 --> 13:36.890
- Let's get back to work.
- Told you ... false alarm.

13:42.062 --> 13:43.530
<i> Frankie!</i>

13:43.564 --> 13:47.434
- Ma. What's the matter?
- Someone stole my wallet!

13:58.280 --> 14:02.855
Ok. I cashed my paycheck,
I put my wallet in my purse {*70 lines need corr.}

14:02.952 --> 14:07.208
I keep my purse underneath
the counter like I always do.

14:07.340 --> 14:11.556
- That's not very safe.
- Clearly Maura, thank you.

14:11.886 --> 14:13.804
You don't think...

14:14.937 --> 14:17.866
- Yeah, I do think.
- Me too.

14:18.420 --> 14:22.115
- I better put these mask right to...
- Ok, put them in a safe.

14:22.301 --> 14:26.853
- I don't have a safe!
- No one's taking you masks, Maura!

14:27.455 --> 14:30.621
Ok, which one
of you snap the wallet? Hm?

14:30.745 --> 14:33.031
Look, anyone of you that
"found" my mother's wallet

14:33.124 --> 14:34.927
you'd turn it now,
we don't press charges.

14:35.033 --> 14:37.901
You heard Detective Vanilla.
If one of you's been guilty parted...

14:38.010 --> 14:40.121
guilty parted better speak up!

14:40.347 --> 14:42.119
- I didn't steal no wallet.
- Me neither.

14:42.216 --> 14:43.683
I want a lawyer.

14:43.786 --> 14:47.052
Stand up.
Do it!

14:51.272 --> 14:52.945
Hold your hands up.

14:53.188 --> 14:57.456
Whoever pull the fire alarm,
has gonna have U.V. dye residue.

15:17.735 --> 15:20.594
So? I turned it on, so
I turned it off.

15:20.823 --> 15:23.520
- Sure you did.
- I didn't steal no wallet. I...

15:23.789 --> 15:25.244
You can't proove nothing!

15:25.340 --> 15:27.986
No, but we can follow mis...
for pulling the alarm.

15:28.235 --> 15:31.390
I know that it doesn't seem like it,
but they're all good kids.

15:31.507 --> 15:35.648
Dawg has scholarship to B.C.U.
And he can lose it, if he gets in trouble.

15:35.765 --> 15:38.647
If?!
Oh, he's in trouble!

15:38.791 --> 15:42.268
You'll find that wallet, Rondo,
then we'll talk.

15:48.469 --> 15:50.204
<i>...but I feel bad.</i>

15:50.677 --> 15:54.326
You think that 20 minutes with us
will turn they lives around?

15:54.743 --> 15:57.460
Hello. Will you support
kids cancer aid, too?

15:57.709 --> 16:01.242
Uh... Boston homicide.
Where we can find Clark West?

16:01.509 --> 16:03.074
Clark!

16:04.375 --> 16:07.923
- What do you want?
- We're investigating a homicide.

16:08.035 --> 16:10.391
Wasn't asking you.
I asked mylady.

16:10.501 --> 16:14.495
Clark West.
Friends call me "Skull Crasher".

16:14.861 --> 16:16.419
You're right bitch, Detective.

16:16.541 --> 16:20.505
No, I am a terrible passanger.
We're here about a murder.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.844
I'm busy.
Gettin' ready for a charity ride.

16:23.988 --> 16:26.459
Here's your choice.
You can answer our questions,

16:26.574 --> 16:29.630
or enjoy a bitch-ride and squad-core
back to headquarters

16:29.736 --> 16:31.714
You've got 30 seconds of my attention.

16:31.817 --> 16:35.113
Greg Jensen, the beermaker you sued,
was murdered yesterday.

16:35.209 --> 16:37.584
You know.
Guy was a prick.

16:37.689 --> 16:39.807
He might ahead something
like that come to you.

16:39.941 --> 16:42.771
We have video of you threatening
Greg Jensen at the courthouse.

16:42.891 --> 16:46.171
Stole my club logo.
Made my daughter a marketing bitch.

16:46.277 --> 16:48.502
Where were you, you say?

16:49.575 --> 16:52.518
Mass Gen.
Pedriatic cancer center.

16:52.639 --> 16:55.879
Bringing toys, books to the kids.
You wanna see the photos?

16:56.006 --> 16:59.529
Big Carl here
maxed up the camera member.

16:59.740 --> 17:04.221
Really cute.
He signed them.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.880
- Good luck with your aid.
- Thank you.

17:18.268 --> 17:19.153
Hi.

17:19.308 --> 17:21.779
I emailed the photo
of the rune letters on

17:21.780 --> 17:24.251
speartip to my old
nordic history professor.

17:24.400 --> 17:30.050
- It says: "Olaf the Boneless"
- The recipy to Viking soup?

17:30.227 --> 17:33.017
Hm. Could it have
meant "Ivar"... I wonder.

17:33.173 --> 17:35.408
- Hm, you too?
- There was a Viking leader named

17:35.518 --> 17:37.266
"Ivar the Boneless".

17:37.382 --> 17:40.199
Some scholars believe that
he was a disabled dwarf, who was

17:40.316 --> 17:43.327
carryin' into battle on his shield.
He was a great warrior.

17:43.686 --> 17:47.751
How was a boneless dwarf
on a shield... great warrior...

17:47.791 --> 17:49.836
You... how'd he managed
to do this?

17:49.946 --> 17:53.235
- Do what?
- A boneless dwarf...

17:53.702 --> 17:56.843
- What was so urgent?
- The crime lab found semenal fluid

17:56.973 --> 18:00.207
mixed with vaginal secretions
in the victim's Tyvek suit.

18:00.331 --> 18:03.212
- It appears to be a month old.
- In?

18:03.666 --> 18:06.755
So, our victim had sex
about month ago and then...

18:06.799 --> 18:10.426
wore his disposable
Tyvek suit again?

18:10.563 --> 18:14.414
Yes. And they also found
vaginal secretions on a spear.

18:14.537 --> 18:18.306
Okay, that qualifies as the
grossest trace evidence ever.  {* from here ok}

18:19.408 --> 18:21.710
Relax.
The secretions were here.

18:21.744 --> 18:25.379
Probably from transfer.
Also about a month old.

18:25.414 --> 18:28.449
And there was enough cellular
material in both to extract DNA.

18:28.484 --> 18:31.152
- We're running it.
- So our killer could be a woman.

18:32.421 --> 18:35.456
Well, since a weapon this sharp
doesn't need much force, it's possible.

18:35.491 --> 18:37.225
Korsak is interviewing
the victim's wife.

18:37.259 --> 18:38.760
I need one of those swabby things.

18:40.696 --> 18:43.565
W... stop! I'll get you
whatever you're looking for.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.234
But I need a more
precise description.

18:45.268 --> 18:47.335
I have to figure out
what you say all day long.

18:47.370 --> 18:50.438
You can't figure out
"swabby thing"? Really?

18:55.710 --> 18:59.046
Mrs. Jensen, this is Detective Rizzoli.

18:59.080 --> 19:01.948
- Very sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

19:01.982 --> 19:03.616
Mrs. Jensen was just telling me

19:03.651 --> 19:06.252
that her husband often
disappeared for days at a time.

19:06.287 --> 19:08.988
You have any idea
where he was going?

19:10.757 --> 19:13.693
He said he was working
on a new Ale recipe.

19:13.728 --> 19:16.997
But I had my suspicions.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.167
I think he was having an affair.

19:25.240 --> 19:27.341
I'm right, aren't I?

19:31.045 --> 19:33.112
We found a woman's DNA on
your husband's clothing.

19:36.416 --> 19:40.586
Was he gone for an extended
period of time about a month ago?

19:40.620 --> 19:44.756
This has been going
on for almost a year.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.693
You understand that
we'll need to rule you out

19:47.727 --> 19:49.094
as a source of that DNA?

19:50.163 --> 19:55.326
Yeah, of course.
Whatever you guys need.

19:57.971 --> 20:01.074
I found a second phone
in my husband's car.

20:01.109 --> 20:04.377
I believe they're
called "burn" phones.

20:04.412 --> 20:06.713
I wrote the number down.

20:09.951 --> 20:11.651
Maybe that'll help.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.755
Thank you.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.928
What were you thinking
Detective Frost?

20:21.929 --> 20:23.254
I guess I wasn't thinking, sir.

20:23.322 --> 20:26.591
- You sure as hell weren't.
- I'm sorry, sir.

20:29.828 --> 20:32.563
- What was that all about?
- I made hazelnut coffee.

20:32.597 --> 20:34.632
Apparently, he doesn't like hazelnut.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.033
Oh, boy.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.602
Why is Cavanaugh in such a lousy mood?

20:38.670 --> 20:41.538
- 'Cause he broke up with my mother.
- You're kidding me.

20:41.573 --> 20:43.274
Unh-unh.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.176
You don't look too surprised.

20:45.210 --> 20:47.278
Uh...
your mother confided in me,

20:47.346 --> 20:49.147
and asked me not to say anything.

20:49.181 --> 20:51.483
Well, good. I'm glad she had you
to talk to. She was really hurt.

20:51.517 --> 20:54.485
- I think she still likes him.
- How do you feel about that?

20:54.520 --> 20:56.821
Like it's time to set a good
example for Mrs. Buttinsky

20:56.856 --> 20:58.323
and not be Detective Buttinsky.

20:59.592 --> 21:03.294
Run this number, will you?
It's our victim's burn phone.

21:03.362 --> 21:05.763
- Wife seems clean to me.
- Me too.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.533
I'm guessing ol' Greg wasn't
calling home on that second phone.

21:08.567 --> 21:11.202
Yeah, he was.
But not the family home.

21:11.236 --> 21:12.737
Our boy had two phones
for two addresses.

21:12.772 --> 21:17.042
He was using his secret
batphone to call...

21:17.076 --> 21:19.645
a back bay condo
he bought a year ago.

21:20.747 --> 21:23.082
I'm thinking not only was
he cheating on his wife,

21:23.116 --> 21:26.519
- he had a little love nest.
- Let's go toss it.

21:36.464 --> 21:38.499
Boston police!
Open the door!

21:46.274 --> 21:47.274
Clear.

21:50.845 --> 21:53.647
I think all that yelling
is just this game.

21:54.883 --> 21:56.216
<i> Clear.</i>

21:57.585 --> 22:00.454
Olaf the Boneless.
That's the same name

22:00.488 --> 22:02.456
that was on the spear
tip that killed him.

22:02.491 --> 22:04.458
Must be Jensen's user name.

22:04.492 --> 22:08.796
Man. He liked playing.
He's logged 2,738 hours.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.398
He has some high-level
weapons, too ...

22:10.432 --> 22:12.700
Porgeir's Ax, Thor's hammer.

22:12.735 --> 22:15.269
And a saga shield?
Damn!

22:15.304 --> 22:18.439
You seem to know
a lot about this, Frost.

22:18.474 --> 22:22.377
- I've dabbled in MMORPG.
- Have you?

22:22.411 --> 22:24.979
Massive multiplayer
online role-playing games.

22:25.014 --> 22:27.048
This one's called
"Vikings of the Realm."

22:27.082 --> 22:29.650
Why would you waste 2,700
hours playing a computer game?

22:29.685 --> 22:31.886
- Points.
- Points for what?

22:31.921 --> 22:33.888
- To win!
- Win what?!

22:33.922 --> 22:37.792
Okay, so... Greg Jensen ran a
successful microbrewing company,

22:37.826 --> 22:41.128
but he pretended to be
"Olaf the Boneless" most of the time.

22:41.162 --> 22:44.030
Look at this ...
snail mail,

22:44.065 --> 22:48.168
addressed to the victim at a P.O. Box,
sent within the last month.

22:48.203 --> 22:51.105
No return address.
Can't read it.

22:54.309 --> 22:56.877
Looks like it's written in rune.

22:58.179 --> 23:03.417
Hey, look at this.
"Your whore is next."

23:03.451 --> 23:05.753
I'm thinking our killer isn't done.

23:07.956 --> 23:09.757
I'm just saying it's
more cost-effective

23:09.791 --> 23:12.860
to get a quart of frozen yogurt
if we're sharing the same flavors.

23:12.894 --> 23:14.127
I like my own, okay?

23:14.162 --> 23:17.765
Well, why don't you like it swirled?
It's still mocha and mint.

23:17.799 --> 23:21.035
No. When you swirl it,
it becomes one flavor.

23:21.069 --> 23:22.770
Coffee toothpaste.

23:24.740 --> 23:26.641
Don't get your pepperoni
grease on my half.

23:26.675 --> 23:29.011
Okay, get your mushroom off my half.

23:31.248 --> 23:32.782
Did you talk to your mother?

23:32.816 --> 23:35.451
Lieutenant Cavanaugh looked
miserable when we left.

23:35.485 --> 23:38.288
Well, maybe because we
have an unsolved homicide

23:38.322 --> 23:40.623
with a killer hiding in a video game.

23:43.828 --> 23:45.295
Who's that?

23:50.034 --> 23:53.569
<i>He did not!
A lavender VW bug?</i>

23:53.603 --> 23:57.072
<i>God's honest truth ...
lavender, for a guy who's...</i>

23:57.106 --> 23:58.874
You feel me?

23:58.908 --> 24:00.743
Who's gonna feel you,
Detective Gibson?

24:00.777 --> 24:02.311
Detective Rizzoli.

24:02.345 --> 24:04.040
How are you? Uh...

24:04.159 --> 24:05.881
I was just
dropping your mother off.

24:07.984 --> 24:09.184
Did you permit this?

24:09.219 --> 24:12.087
Well, I insisted they each
have one foot on the floor

24:12.122 --> 24:14.456
when there's heavy petting
on your mother's bed.

24:15.592 --> 24:17.760
You're so funny.

24:17.794 --> 24:23.698
- Uh, Ma, can I talk to you for a sec?
- Uh... s-sure.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.902
Oh, hey,
I'm just gonna go upstairs.

24:27.937 --> 24:30.272
I think I forgot to charge
my electric toothbrush.

24:30.306 --> 24:33.108
Okay, why are you doing
this to Lieutenant Cavanaugh?

24:33.142 --> 24:36.211
Okay, Jane, this is
so not your business.

24:36.246 --> 24:39.181
Yeah, it is. Especially when
he's taking it out on all of us.

24:39.216 --> 24:40.783
The ... the entire squad.

24:40.817 --> 24:43.919
Well, then he's more juvenile
than I thought he was.

24:43.954 --> 24:45.454
You want to hear juvenile?

24:45.488 --> 24:49.192
"If you were a car,
you'd be a '68 Dodge Charger."

24:49.226 --> 24:52.728
- You don't even like that goofball.
- Don't call him that.

24:52.763 --> 24:55.398
- And I do, too!
- I don't believe you.

24:55.432 --> 24:57.066
And if you are doing this
just to get to Cavanaugh,

24:57.100 --> 24:59.702
then I'm gonna say the
same thing you told me.

24:59.737 --> 25:03.073
Don't.
It's beneath you.

25:05.943 --> 25:07.244
Jane.

25:08.780 --> 25:11.147
Wh... Ma?
A-are you crying?

25:11.182 --> 25:14.785
- I'm so proud of you.
- W-w-why are you crying?

25:14.820 --> 25:18.255
Because I raised you ...
I raised a beautiful girl.

25:23.629 --> 25:25.095
And...

25:27.032 --> 25:28.299
...you're right.

25:30.635 --> 25:31.702
Thank you.

25:33.038 --> 25:36.573
- I love you, Ma.
- I love you more.

25:41.312 --> 25:43.346
- Thanks, gorgeous.
- Detective.

25:44.382 --> 25:45.682
That's a good sign.

25:45.716 --> 25:47.017
At least she's not drawing
attentntion to her mouth.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.853
No sign of flirtation.

25:49.888 --> 25:53.057
I needed a pick-me-up
after that Porsche fiasco.

25:53.091 --> 25:56.193
You hear about this, Rizzoli?
Everybody's talking about it.

25:56.228 --> 25:59.196
Oh, yeah, everyone's talking
about that old "Porsh," Gibson.

25:59.231 --> 26:01.999
It's "Porsh-ah."

26:02.033 --> 26:05.002
Really?
"Gibson" is an italian name?

26:05.037 --> 26:10.274
No. But some of us know a lot
about high-end italian rides.

26:11.242 --> 26:13.911
It's a german car, you idiot.

26:13.945 --> 26:16.213
<i>I think they're
crotch-blocking each other.</i>

26:16.247 --> 26:17.748
"Crotch-blocking"?
Really?

26:19.751 --> 26:21.085
It's my old nordic-history professor.

26:21.119 --> 26:22.319
His office says he's almost here.

26:22.354 --> 26:25.456
Mrs. Vanilla.
We found your wallet!

26:25.490 --> 26:29.326
Rondo, thank you!
Oh! Where'd you find it, Rondo?

26:29.361 --> 26:30.928
I knew you guys didn't take it.

26:30.962 --> 26:34.198
Well, we checked the trash.
Dania found it in a dumpster.

26:35.233 --> 26:36.567
Is everything there, Ma?

26:36.601 --> 26:40.872
Well, my license, my
ATM card, my cash ...

26:40.907 --> 26:41.906
Oh.

26:43.209 --> 26:46.077
- I'm missing 100 bucks.
- Are you sure, Mrs. Vanilla?

26:48.114 --> 26:50.281
Okay, Dawg, let's go.
We're going upstairs to booking.

26:50.316 --> 26:52.817
No, Jane, wait.
Let me handle this.

26:54.120 --> 26:55.654
How would your mother feel?

26:55.688 --> 26:58.690
She wouldn't be very proud, would she?

26:59.625 --> 27:02.360
Um...
Dawg doesn't have a mother.

27:02.395 --> 27:05.063
- His mother passed.
- Oh.

27:05.097 --> 27:05.964
Oh.

27:05.998 --> 27:09.300
Oh, I'm ... I'm sor...
don't cry.

27:09.335 --> 27:12.003
- Don't cry. All right.
- He didn't do it.

27:12.972 --> 27:14.272
He's covering for me.

27:14.306 --> 27:16.541
The money's there.
I put it back.

27:16.576 --> 27:19.177
Dania, why would
you steal from me?

27:19.212 --> 27:21.446
I needed $100 for a textbook.

27:21.481 --> 27:23.148
Well, why didn't you tell the teacher?

27:23.183 --> 27:28.821
- I didn't want her to know ...
- What?

27:28.855 --> 27:32.291
That ... that you live
in a teen shelter?

27:32.325 --> 27:33.993
Yeah.

27:35.295 --> 27:39.064
You went to the bathroom.
I took the wallet out of your purse.

27:39.099 --> 27:43.335
Dawg saw you coming, and he
pulled the alarm to cover for me.

27:43.369 --> 27:46.605
- I'm really sorry.
- I'm sorry, too.

27:58.656 --> 28:01.324
Jane.
This is professor Walter Lowell

28:01.359 --> 28:02.893
from the Department
of scandinavian studies

28:02.927 --> 28:04.427
at Boston Cambridge university.

28:04.462 --> 28:07.263
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.
- The pleasure is mine.

28:07.298 --> 28:09.932
Dr. Isles was about
to show me some letters

28:09.967 --> 28:13.702
written in the rune alphabet that
you all would like me to translate.

28:13.736 --> 28:15.871
Yes.
I have some of the letters here.

28:15.905 --> 28:18.373
We made copies of the originals.

28:18.407 --> 28:20.876
Oh, floppy disks?

28:20.910 --> 28:25.013
Oh, yes, I certainly do remember
when the floppies were the originals.

28:26.416 --> 28:29.284
When you said "old," I didn't realize

28:29.319 --> 28:33.489
that you meant he and
Olaf went on Viking raids... together.

28:33.523 --> 28:35.591
He's hard of hearing,
but he can read lips.

28:35.626 --> 28:39.162
These appear to be
written in proto-norse.

28:39.196 --> 28:42.132
That's an indo-european
language spoken in Scandinavia.

28:42.166 --> 28:43.533
It's thought to have evolved

28:43.568 --> 28:47.337
as a proto-germanic northern
dialect over the 1st century A.D.

28:47.372 --> 28:50.073
Please ...
one nerd at a time.

28:50.108 --> 28:56.180
Well, these are love letters
addressed to a Viking

28:56.214 --> 28:59.850
by the name of Olaf the Boneless.

28:59.885 --> 29:04.054
No, that's ...
that's historically incorrect.

29:04.088 --> 29:06.824
it's Ivar the Boneless.

29:09.260 --> 29:10.695
Hmm.

29:10.729 --> 29:13.098
I hope he's not
charging us by the hour.

29:13.132 --> 29:14.099
Stop.

29:14.133 --> 29:16.534
They were written by Olaf's lover,

29:16.568 --> 29:20.538
a Viking maiden by the name of Gunnhild.

29:20.572 --> 29:26.076
Oh, dear. Olaf was still married
to a different Viking maiden

29:26.111 --> 29:28.079
by the name of Undirmaor.

29:28.113 --> 29:31.081
- You know, "Undirmaor" means ...
- Not now, Maura.

29:31.116 --> 29:34.685
Exactly how deep
into this game was he?

29:34.719 --> 29:36.821
Listen to this.

29:36.855 --> 29:41.025
"Your velvety beard still hums

29:41.060 --> 29:45.697
against the bosom of my tender flesh."

29:47.067 --> 29:50.636
Okay. Well, uh, you've
been very helpful.

29:52.038 --> 29:53.872
The DNA recovered from
the spear is a match

29:53.907 --> 29:56.575
for the DNA found on the victim.
It's from the same woman.

29:56.610 --> 29:58.911
- Thank you, Susie.
- Okay, well, that's a big break.

29:58.946 --> 30:00.046
Yep.

30:00.080 --> 30:02.915
It was nice to meet you.

30:02.950 --> 30:06.119
Oh, no, no, no, no,
I'm not finished with your letters.

30:06.153 --> 30:08.621
Sit. Sit.
Have some tea.

30:08.655 --> 30:10.590
Have some tea.

30:10.624 --> 30:17.564
"Cold are the counsel of women."
Cold, indeed.

30:20.536 --> 30:22.972
Find anything on the victim's computer?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.946
Nothing useful.
He just used it to play MMOS.

30:25.981 --> 30:27.848
No idea how he had
a successful business.

30:27.883 --> 30:31.052
I guess playing with Geirlaug of Gongu
is more fun than making beer.

30:31.086 --> 30:32.654
"Vikings of the Realm" game makers

30:32.688 --> 30:34.589
sent over subscriber information ...

30:34.623 --> 30:37.092
12,000 names of people
Greg Jensen played with.

30:37.126 --> 30:39.794
I was about to go through
them when Jane rescued me.

30:39.829 --> 30:42.496
- Where is she?
- Trapped with professor Windbag.

30:42.531 --> 30:45.132
Undirmaor and... Gunnhild?

30:46.568 --> 30:49.003
I can't find under-girl,
but I found the other one.

30:50.772 --> 30:53.074
Gunnhild is va-va-va-voom!

30:53.108 --> 30:54.909
Her name is Kendra Dee.

30:54.943 --> 30:57.845
She logs in from her
house in South End ...

30:57.880 --> 31:00.815
conveniently located
just minutes from us.

31:00.849 --> 31:04.151
I'm not doing anything.
I could help you pick her up.

31:13.662 --> 31:18.866
Yes, that's my avatar.
Can't you tell?

31:18.900 --> 31:20.668
Yeah. Quite the resemblance.

31:21.670 --> 31:23.971
Were you having an
affair with Greg Jensen?

31:24.006 --> 31:26.207
Oh, I was.

31:26.241 --> 31:31.279
It was the most intensely
passionate affair of my life.

31:31.313 --> 31:36.518
We made love on the Isle
of Thanet, Nottingham, York.

31:38.287 --> 31:43.458
- Ma'am, was this I.R.L.?
- It was enchanting and magical.

31:43.492 --> 31:46.294
Olaf swept me off my feet.

31:46.329 --> 31:49.731
That's not what I asked.
Was it I.R.L.?

31:49.766 --> 31:51.333
It was not.

31:51.367 --> 31:54.135
- What's "I.R.L."?
- "In real life."

31:55.071 --> 32:00.075
- Ma'am, have you seen this before?
- No, but I can read rune letters.

32:00.110 --> 32:05.949
It's the name of my lover ...
"Olaf the Boneless."

32:07.952 --> 32:10.153
Did you write these
letters to Greg Jensen?

32:10.187 --> 32:14.991
To Olaf.
It's a shame he's dead.

32:16.460 --> 32:18.894
This has to be the work of Undirmaor.

32:18.929 --> 32:22.664
She did everything in her
power to drive us apart.

32:22.699 --> 32:25.201
Do you know who
Undirmaor is in the, uh...

32:25.235 --> 32:28.037
- ... the I.R.L.?
- No. I do not.

32:28.071 --> 32:32.007
But mark my words ...
I will get that woman.

32:32.042 --> 32:38.080
Take my card a-and call me
before you do that. Ma'am.

32:38.114 --> 32:41.550
Ma'am.
Greg Jensen was killed I.R.L.

32:41.584 --> 32:43.718
Yeah. By an R.P.

32:44.787 --> 32:46.522
"Real person."

32:50.293 --> 32:51.426
It's Jane.

32:51.461 --> 32:54.263
We'd like to do a cheek
swab for a DNA sample.

32:54.297 --> 32:56.731
If you must.

32:56.766 --> 33:01.336
Darn!
Who am I gonna play with now?

33:09.811 --> 33:12.379
Oh, my god.
I thought that professor

33:12.413 --> 33:15.349
would never stop
talking about underwear.

33:15.383 --> 33:18.885
Undirmaor has got mad hacking skills.

33:18.919 --> 33:21.989
Keeps changing accounts,
deleted her avatar's history.

33:23.791 --> 33:26.259
Well, what do you know?
It's Gunnhild.

33:27.428 --> 33:28.762
She's cute.

33:28.796 --> 33:31.598
She stopped looking like that in 1963.

33:31.632 --> 33:35.334
She's at a secret gaming event.
I'm invited.

33:35.369 --> 33:36.802
Well, the DNA results
haven't come back yet.

33:36.837 --> 33:37.970
She could be our killer.

33:38.005 --> 33:39.205
Uh-oh.

33:39.240 --> 33:41.340
She's says she's about to
make contact with Undirmaor.

33:41.375 --> 33:42.608
Let's go.

33:50.150 --> 33:53.786
There's Porgeir.
And there's Thor.

33:53.820 --> 33:56.155
And Grettir.
And Refur!

33:57.424 --> 33:58.824
"Refur"?

34:01.895 --> 34:03.629
Well, I don't see my date.

34:03.664 --> 34:06.032
<i>Speak your preference, Viking king ...</i>

34:06.066 --> 34:08.967
Raiding, looting,
pillaging, slaughtering.

34:11.639 --> 34:15.107
Maybe...
Erich the Blood Ax has seen her.

34:15.141 --> 34:17.610
Whoa!
Your name, wench?

34:17.643 --> 34:19.812
Detective Rizzoli, Boston homicide.

34:21.781 --> 34:24.449
I'm sorry.
W-we're role-playing.

34:24.484 --> 34:25.717
Get it, yeah.

34:25.751 --> 34:28.453
Uh, we're looking for
a Viking named "Gunnhild."

34:28.487 --> 34:30.987
Sure, yeah ... the babe.

34:33.058 --> 34:35.126
She's in the lower realm.

34:37.395 --> 34:40.364
<i> Come on!
You've only got one life left.</i>

34:40.399 --> 34:42.367
<i> And I got to go
back to the beginning.</i>

34:42.400 --> 34:45.203
Oh, crap.
Mrs. D! Kendra!

34:45.237 --> 34:47.072
Call for backup.
We got to lock this place down.

34:47.774 --> 34:49.875
Hey, you.
You! Hey!

34:49.909 --> 34:52.578
I need all units in the
area at Solly's comic store.

34:52.612 --> 34:53.813
Did you see anyone come in here?

34:53.847 --> 34:55.148
Uh, no, sir.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

34:55.181 --> 34:58.451
Make sure nobody leaves
this store, all right? Go on!

35:00.387 --> 35:02.989
She was stabbed with a dagger
... just like in the game.

35:04.392 --> 35:06.326
Who the hell is Undirmaor?

35:06.360 --> 35:08.261
Because that's our killer.

35:13.154 --> 35:15.154
Tell me you have something

35:15.155 --> 35:16.722
'cause we don't have a single witness.,

35:16.756 --> 35:19.958
Well, I found a hair on
Kendra's cloak. No root ball.

35:19.993 --> 35:22.427
But we are trying a new
forensic laser technique.

35:22.462 --> 35:24.797
It uses ultraviolet light
and mass spectrometry.

35:24.831 --> 35:27.799
- Faster, please.
- Zaps the hair and turns it into a gas.

35:27.834 --> 35:29.968
Explain how that's gonna
help me solve two murders.

35:30.003 --> 35:32.138
It may help us determine
what the killer ate

35:32.172 --> 35:33.505
and drank over the last year.

35:33.540 --> 35:36.842
How is knowing how many ding
dongs our suspect ate helpful?

35:36.877 --> 35:39.378
The mass spectrometer results
are back on the hair tests.

35:39.413 --> 35:42.148
- I know you've been waiting for them.
- Thank you.

35:42.182 --> 35:47.754
Because hair grows slowly over time,
it creates a timeline of sorts.

35:47.788 --> 35:50.791
Okay.
So, what did the killer eat ...

35:50.859 --> 35:54.662
Uh, let me see ...
for breakfast in April?

35:54.696 --> 35:57.265
- That's interesting.
- It certainly is.

35:57.699 --> 36:01.670
Strawberry waffles?
Eggs benedict? What?

36:01.704 --> 36:05.240
Fermented minke whale
and sheep's head cheese.

36:05.275 --> 36:09.712
Where would you get minke
whale and sheep's head cheese,

36:09.746 --> 36:11.280
assuming you'd want it?

36:11.314 --> 36:13.749
Um... Scandinavia?

36:14.751 --> 36:19.723
Scandinavia.
Maura, what does "Undirmaor" mean?

36:19.757 --> 36:22.292
- In english?
- No. In proto-hobbit.

36:22.327 --> 36:25.496
- Yes, in english!
- "Underling" or "apprentice."

36:25.530 --> 36:28.800
Apprentice.
Or assistant.

36:30.035 --> 36:34.973
Maura, we know someone who's
probably been eating whale or sheep.

36:35.007 --> 36:37.609
Got a warrant.
Alibi was bullshit.

36:37.644 --> 36:40.645
The airline just confirmed
Ruby Burke, Greg Jensen's assistant,

36:40.680 --> 36:44.015
flew standby on an earlier
flight from Reykjavik.

36:44.050 --> 36:46.618
- Nice, Frost.
- Okay. Thanks.

36:48.087 --> 36:49.554
Ruby didn't show up to work today.

36:49.588 --> 36:51.723
She's playing
"Vikings of the realm" somewhere.

36:51.758 --> 36:55.961
- So I put a bolo out in the realm?
- No. I built an avatar to find her.

36:56.996 --> 36:58.230
Looks just like you.

36:59.298 --> 37:00.565
We got to go in disguise.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.901
I still don't understand
the point of this stupid game.

37:02.935 --> 37:05.736
Well, what is so hard about it?

37:05.771 --> 37:11.542
You raid ships, plunder villages,
Kill sworn enemies... to win.

37:11.576 --> 37:13.410
Win what? A fantasy lover?

37:13.445 --> 37:17.281
Wait a minute.
I don't think this is about winning.

37:17.315 --> 37:18.749
I think this is about love.

37:18.783 --> 37:21.118
You think Greg Jensen was
having a real affair with Ruby?

37:21.152 --> 37:24.054
I don't know.
It wasn't much of an affair.

37:24.089 --> 37:26.290
There wasn't any evidence
of her at his love nest,

37:26.324 --> 37:30.127
and the secretions and the seminal fluid
that we found were a month old.

37:30.161 --> 37:31.962
Unless Jensen had pity sex.

37:31.997 --> 37:34.765
- Pity sex?
- Yeah, one-time pity sex,

37:34.799 --> 37:36.700
right before he sent
Ruby to Scandinavia.

37:36.735 --> 37:40.370
I mean, he froze her out ...
in real life and in the game, too.

37:40.405 --> 37:42.406
So, Ruby must have
stalked him in the game,

37:42.441 --> 37:44.575
figured out that he had
a new virtual lover...

37:44.609 --> 37:47.378
"Gunnhild," A.K.A. Kendra Dee.

37:47.413 --> 37:51.283
Frost...
check and see if Olaf is online.

37:51.317 --> 37:54.519
Olaf? But Greg Jensen
is dead in the I.R.L.

37:54.554 --> 37:57.489
So explain why Olaf is online
in his back bay love nest.

37:57.524 --> 37:59.258
Not Olaf ... Undirmaor.

38:01.728 --> 38:03.462
Hey.

38:17.642 --> 38:18.909
Ruby, put your hands in the air.

38:18.943 --> 38:21.678
<i> Olaf, my love.</i>

38:21.713 --> 38:24.347
<i>Undirmaor. At last...
you're here.</i>

38:24.382 --> 38:27.217
Ru...
she doesn't even know we're here.

38:27.252 --> 38:28.252
Korsak, unplug that thing.

38:33.658 --> 38:36.727
No.
No! Olaf!

38:36.761 --> 38:38.662
Olaf, please come back, my love.

38:38.696 --> 38:41.698
- Ruby, it's over.
- It's not over.

38:41.732 --> 38:44.200
We were finally together.
Turn it on.

38:44.234 --> 38:45.368
Bring him back.

38:45.402 --> 38:48.037
He's not coming back.
Greg is dead, Ruby.

38:52.575 --> 38:55.009
I loved him.

38:56.645 --> 38:58.713
He loved me.

38:58.747 --> 39:02.150
Did he love Ruby Burke,
or did he love Undirmaor?

39:02.185 --> 39:05.820
He loved me.
Me.

39:07.089 --> 39:10.993
Olaf loved Undirmaor,
and I thought...

39:11.027 --> 39:15.832
oh, god, if only, if only
he knew that it was me ...

39:15.866 --> 39:18.968
me, Ruby, right there all along...

39:19.002 --> 39:20.970
Did you tell him who
you were before or after

39:21.004 --> 39:22.872
you slept with him a month ago?

39:26.377 --> 39:29.345
I gave him my flesh.

39:29.380 --> 39:32.982
And when I told him I
was Undirmaor, he just...

39:33.017 --> 39:36.018
he sent me away.

39:41.358 --> 39:43.726
Ruby, you're under arrest
for the murder of Greg Jensen.

39:43.761 --> 39:45.829
No! No!
Please turn it back on!

39:45.863 --> 39:47.030
And Kendra Dee.

39:47.064 --> 39:49.532
No! 
No, he's not gone!

39:49.567 --> 39:52.602
No, he's not gone!
He can't be!

39:52.636 --> 39:54.971
He can't be gone!

39:56.774 --> 39:59.375
Go right to jail!

40:00.544 --> 40:03.846
My turn.
I want to buy me some property.

40:03.880 --> 40:06.348
Hope you hid the good silver.

40:06.383 --> 40:10.052
You pretend to be such a badass,
but you're really a pushover.

40:10.086 --> 40:11.720
I'm glad you brought them here.

40:11.755 --> 40:14.857
Why? So you could study
aberrant juvenile behavior?

40:14.891 --> 40:17.860
They just need some
attention, a little support.

40:17.894 --> 40:19.695
I mean, they've never
played a board game.

40:19.729 --> 40:22.631
- Can you believe that?
- I know.

40:22.665 --> 40:24.834
Maura, how much garlic
did you put on this bread?

40:24.868 --> 40:26.435
- Six cloves.
- Six cl...

40:26.470 --> 40:29.804
They're homeless teenagers.
They're not vampires.

40:31.107 --> 40:32.441
What about Dania?

40:32.475 --> 40:34.710
Well, I'm
gonna keep an eye on her.

40:34.744 --> 40:37.847
And so are you.
And we'll make sure

40:37.881 --> 40:40.649
that she puts that
big brain to good use.

40:40.684 --> 40:44.053
And I talked to Cavanaugh.
The mentor program is now official.

40:44.087 --> 40:45.054
Great.

40:45.088 --> 40:46.589
<i>Yes! Whoo-hoo!</i>

40:46.623 --> 40:50.392
- I wanted park place!
- Oh, too bad, Mrs. Vanilla.

40:50.426 --> 40:52.494
- Hey, Vanilla.
- Yeah.

40:52.528 --> 40:54.897
I'm a landlord!

40:57.667 --> 41:00.436
I never pictured an
evening in with Rondo.

41:01.504 --> 41:03.572
Jane.

41:03.607 --> 41:07.076
You don't think that your mom might...

41:07.110 --> 41:09.278
I don't want to seem
uncharitable, but...

41:09.313 --> 41:14.017
Yes, I will make sure that
the Rondo's rejects family

41:14.051 --> 41:15.651
does not move into
your guesthouse, yes.

41:15.686 --> 41:17.086
Thank you.

41:17.120 --> 41:19.421
- Who's hungry?
- I'm starving.

41:19.456 --> 41:21.690
- Me too!
- Me too! Me too!

41:21.724 --> 41:24.760
<i>- Here you go.
- Oh, man, this looks good!</i>

41:24.794 --> 41:26.161
<i>All right, lasagna's hot.</i>

41:28.999 --> 41:30.132
<i>No, no, no. I got it.</i>

41:30.167 --> 41:32.802
No. No. N-n-no.
J-just look.

41:32.837 --> 41:35.672
- Like this.
- Okay.
