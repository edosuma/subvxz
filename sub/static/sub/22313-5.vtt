00:00.150 --> 00:02.086
Last time on Superstition...

00:02.211 --> 00:04.219
Looks like you're gonna be
the man of the house soon.

00:04.228 --> 00:06.184
Want you to take this.

00:06.209 --> 00:07.406
How can you see her?

00:07.464 --> 00:08.661
It must be Pop's ring.

00:08.914 --> 00:10.728
He is your father whether
you like it or not.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.404
I wish it was you and not my mom.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.366
Did you just jump dimensions for me?

00:14.448 --> 00:16.114
I couldn't bear to lose another son.

00:16.135 --> 00:17.746
Now, I need to protect my family.

00:26.608 --> 00:28.271
Arlo, what are you doing?

00:29.137 --> 00:30.862
Pop said that was off limits.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.779
- It's just a ring, Calvin.
- Last week I touched what I thought

00:33.804 --> 00:35.848
was just a watch and my
hand still stinks. Let's go.

00:35.899 --> 00:37.457
Aren't you curious?

00:37.872 --> 00:39.449
- No.
- Come on, look.

00:39.475 --> 00:43.260
- We're in a room filled with dope ass weapons.
- Arlo.

00:43.603 --> 00:46.617
Crossbows, swords,

00:47.041 --> 00:48.909
talismans.

00:49.348 --> 00:51.887
There's gotta be something
awesome about that weapon.

00:52.012 --> 00:53.446
That ring.

00:54.366 --> 00:58.101
Nothing so closely
represents our family's legacy

00:58.452 --> 01:00.106
as that ring.

01:02.578 --> 01:04.539
When you put it on...

01:07.706 --> 01:10.421
You have to be fully
committed to using it,

01:10.856 --> 01:12.752
without hesitation.

01:13.065 --> 01:15.563
What if we hesitate, Pop?

01:17.990 --> 01:20.033
When you're ready...

01:20.818 --> 01:23.520
And only when you're really
ready for all the responsibility

01:23.539 --> 01:25.181
that comes with knowing,

01:25.306 --> 01:26.842
I'll tell you both.

01:27.474 --> 01:29.908
Not until then. Hmm?

01:30.603 --> 01:33.262
But what'd I tell ya'll
about being in this room?

01:46.244 --> 01:48.760
Hey, Calvin.

01:49.296 --> 01:52.004
- Um...
- Hey.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.648
- What a coincidence.
- Imagine that. Yeah.

01:54.668 --> 01:56.781
What, that in a town
with limited food options

01:56.794 --> 01:58.416
we'd see you here for lunch?

01:59.189 --> 02:00.926
So...

02:01.051 --> 02:02.874
Since we're all here,

02:02.893 --> 02:05.148
we may as well just share
a table, make it easy.

02:05.273 --> 02:07.089
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.836
Yeah, let's do that.

02:09.215 --> 02:10.576
Okay, I get it.

02:10.601 --> 02:11.994
You guys set up this whole

02:12.007 --> 02:14.351
little happy to run into
each other family meal.

02:14.958 --> 02:17.010
You're lucky you caught me at
the right amount of starving.

02:17.020 --> 02:18.384
I cannot fight this.

02:19.350 --> 02:21.482
Let's get to the tough decisions first.

02:22.542 --> 02:24.428
Curly fries or onion rings?

03:04.944 --> 03:07.197
I got bad news.

03:09.746 --> 03:12.642
What you've got is bad timing.

03:13.205 --> 03:14.758
Ain't no good timing

03:14.983 --> 03:17.210
to deliver what I got to say.

03:17.921 --> 03:20.276
What you do with the
message is up to you.

03:20.664 --> 03:22.232
But I will caution.

03:22.641 --> 03:26.320
If ignored, your
family will end up dead.

03:26.445 --> 03:30.458
As dead as that man in the box.

03:32.722 --> 03:36.656
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

03:38.382 --> 03:40.462
I miss this sauce.

03:40.926 --> 03:42.219
Ketchup?

03:42.612 --> 03:45.933
I will have you know,

03:45.981 --> 03:49.812
this is a very complex,
secret family blend.

03:49.894 --> 03:51.375
And your mom will back me on it.

03:51.676 --> 03:53.348
'Cause she used to make
it almost every week.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.316
- You worked at the Cottonmouth?
- We're not discussing that.

03:57.337 --> 03:59.156
She was a waitress, but
she spent most of her time

03:59.166 --> 04:00.318
telling everybody else what to do.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.593
Yeah, that I believe.

04:01.718 --> 04:03.085
Well, here's what you want.

04:03.089 --> 04:04.125
One night,

04:04.418 --> 04:06.375
your mom, she was supposed to
be cleaning the grease traps.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.153
But she ends up Tom
Sawyering me to do it.

04:08.173 --> 04:09.981
I believe I rewarded you

04:10.011 --> 04:12.167
with something very special
that night, did I not?

04:14.241 --> 04:16.392
Oh, my God. You had sex
with him for grease traps?

04:16.459 --> 04:18.559
God, no, Garvey!

04:18.594 --> 04:22.921
Your mom made this recipe for fries

04:22.937 --> 04:24.746
out of almost everything
she could find in the kitchen

04:24.756 --> 04:26.166
that was borderline expired.

04:26.426 --> 04:30.207
Chili, uh, pastrami, hot
sauce, more hot sauce,

04:30.229 --> 04:33.313
- cheddar cheese.
- It was not cheddar, it was pimento.

04:33.329 --> 04:34.968
If you're going to tell
the story, tell it right.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.591
Whatever. And she called
it fireworks fries.

04:38.652 --> 04:39.793
What's the fireworks?

04:40.206 --> 04:41.709
What was it, hot sauce?

04:41.995 --> 04:43.026
Uh...

04:44.371 --> 04:45.773
Well, that was where your mom

04:46.084 --> 04:47.841
finally decided to tell me she loved me.

04:49.235 --> 04:52.124
After, big guy here, told me first.

04:53.440 --> 04:57.291
And then we took up the
old Cottonmouth tradition

04:57.336 --> 04:59.093
of carving our initials into the bar.

04:59.118 --> 05:01.641
Along with the hundreds of
other initials that were there.

05:01.657 --> 05:03.521
Random initials.

05:03.646 --> 05:05.494
- You remember, May?
- Yeah.

05:05.729 --> 05:07.998
And it's still up there if
you wanna see it, Garvey.

05:10.056 --> 05:11.273
Why?

05:13.071 --> 05:15.470
To see a symbol of
something that doesn't exist?

05:15.514 --> 05:18.045
I mean, all tradition, you
guys still split up, so...

05:18.071 --> 05:19.476
- Garvey.
- What?

05:19.894 --> 05:22.628
We're not a family. Not a real one.

05:22.674 --> 05:24.998
So, the next time you guys
wanna ambush me, skip it.

05:36.559 --> 05:37.928
Looks like Mom needs me.

05:38.598 --> 05:40.018
I gotta run.

05:44.407 --> 05:45.434
Mmm.

05:55.580 --> 05:57.000
So, you two are old friends?

05:57.501 --> 05:59.227
In a manner of speaking.

05:59.518 --> 06:02.380
And I've known your
father ways before that.

06:03.028 --> 06:04.939
Like the kind of old friends

06:04.975 --> 06:06.946
that value faded pictures
of each other or...

06:07.381 --> 06:09.195
The kind that have some
long standing grudge.

06:13.850 --> 06:15.969
Guess we'll keep this
conversation about the present.

06:17.093 --> 06:19.803
Well, pecan pie and visions of death.

06:20.266 --> 06:22.999
You have my undivided
attention, Aunt Nancy.

06:23.807 --> 06:26.842
So, how exactly are we going to die?

06:27.588 --> 06:28.977
The Dredge.

06:30.433 --> 06:32.742
That furnace is still kicking,
we can go ahead there right now.

06:32.993 --> 06:36.030
I wouldn't be so quick
to rush to the very thing

06:36.053 --> 06:39.959
- that's trying to take you and your family down.
- Why is its sights set on us?

06:40.084 --> 06:43.133
If I knew that I wouldn't
have bought the sweets.

06:44.372 --> 06:45.822
But...

06:46.141 --> 06:49.123
Every piece of a person's life

06:49.666 --> 06:52.004
is woven like a web.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.215
One moment, this moment.

06:55.445 --> 06:57.744
Past, future, all...

06:57.993 --> 06:59.777
Conducted as one.

07:00.509 --> 07:04.526
I've gleaned that the fight
coming with The Dredge,

07:04.590 --> 07:07.859
is tied to another nasty inferno,

07:08.746 --> 07:11.154
in your past.

07:14.079 --> 07:16.270
Aunt Nancy has a gift

07:16.615 --> 07:18.564
for collecting memories.

07:18.934 --> 07:20.898
And once collected,

07:21.578 --> 07:24.305
I can read 'em like the pages of a book.

07:25.748 --> 07:27.230
That's quite a tale.

07:28.871 --> 07:30.174
Aunt Nancy, huh?

07:31.279 --> 07:32.509
That's cute.

07:33.029 --> 07:34.913
Little play on words.

07:35.213 --> 07:36.854
Because she's no one's aunt.

07:36.979 --> 07:39.952
You're looking at the Anansi.

07:42.079 --> 07:44.959
There's quite a few Anansis
running around these days.

07:44.966 --> 07:46.556
There's only one.

07:46.681 --> 07:50.363
Heard you died, like,
100 years ago in Ghana.

07:50.488 --> 07:52.822
A good story is hard to keep buried.

07:53.161 --> 07:56.322
And the new ones always have to

07:56.686 --> 07:58.117
change the title.

07:58.155 --> 08:00.004
Curacao, Shi Maria.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.192
Professional trickster.

08:02.317 --> 08:05.047
Different names, same old lies.

08:05.507 --> 08:08.119
Except she's gonna use
her creepy blood magic

08:08.145 --> 08:10.948
to weave a web of them
to catch your tail.

08:11.155 --> 08:13.451
Whether you want to give it up or not.

08:13.911 --> 08:15.706
I see you two are old friends, too.

08:15.738 --> 08:17.654
She's a guest in our home, Tilly.

08:17.659 --> 08:19.595
Yeah, I would've recommended
that you keep her in the porch,

08:19.616 --> 08:21.140
but it looks like we're way past that.

08:21.170 --> 08:22.815
- Do not eat that pie!
- Hey!

08:22.856 --> 08:26.075
I see you still have a
flair for the dramatic.

08:26.442 --> 08:30.014
My guess, there'll be no
shortage of drama today.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.085
Calvin!

08:40.101 --> 08:43.457
- Calvin, what's wrong?
- You see, I warned you!

08:44.249 --> 08:47.386
Looks like we'll be
skipping once upon a time.

08:52.043 --> 08:53.813
What is this, Aunt Nancy?

08:54.880 --> 08:57.247
Don't worry he's not
dead, it's just that

08:57.697 --> 09:00.967
some people that need to
go on a journey the most

09:00.980 --> 09:02.864
need a little push.

09:02.908 --> 09:05.975
What exactly are you
pushing my boy to remember?

09:20.313 --> 09:25.216
You and I have been on the
same side more than not,

09:25.261 --> 09:27.445
but you come into my home

09:27.490 --> 09:31.462
talking about the most
painful day of my life...

09:32.982 --> 09:35.925
You'd better have a damn good reason

09:35.957 --> 09:37.573
to dig into this darkness.

09:37.618 --> 09:41.462
We shut some memories
behind a door, Bea.

09:42.343 --> 09:44.079
'Cause some losses

09:44.105 --> 09:47.040
are just too hard to go on
with them out in the open.

09:47.165 --> 09:49.540
What happened to Arlo was a tragedy,

09:49.665 --> 09:53.711
I came to keep you
from having another one.

10:12.170 --> 10:13.550
Arlo?

10:21.035 --> 10:22.510
No.

10:24.924 --> 10:26.086
Pop!

10:26.211 --> 10:27.753
Why?

10:28.206 --> 10:30.123
Why?

10:33.138 --> 10:35.512
I understand you have reservations.

10:35.858 --> 10:38.387
But she and her family
have a long history of...

10:38.444 --> 10:41.581
Which I'll remind you
hasn't always been so smooth.

10:42.744 --> 10:44.531
She's dangerous, Bea.

10:45.451 --> 10:48.357
Don't confuse power with danger.

10:50.062 --> 10:53.166
Your family and I have
always done what's best,

10:53.166 --> 10:56.239
with regard to this very unique town.

10:56.268 --> 10:59.869
And how many other towns have
you left behind during your wake?

10:59.971 --> 11:04.057
Traveling around collecting stories,
collateral damage to be damned.

11:04.951 --> 11:06.910
You've come to like
the drama, haven't you?

11:07.238 --> 11:10.661
She's an unreliable narrator.

11:11.249 --> 11:14.104
You view people, so they're
mainly just characters, huh?

11:14.119 --> 11:15.547
Live or die,

11:15.672 --> 11:17.995
bothers you in the least.

11:19.489 --> 11:21.316
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

11:21.354 --> 11:24.439
Sometimes the answer's
gotta rattle loose.

11:24.452 --> 11:25.908
Bring him out of the vision.

11:25.931 --> 11:28.202
I can't. It's like Tilly said,

11:28.266 --> 11:30.910
I'm not the writer, I'm just the reader.

11:30.936 --> 11:35.004
- What does that mean exactly?
- Calvin's gotta wake himself.

11:37.295 --> 11:39.042
- Is that...
- Stand back.

11:40.707 --> 11:41.997
Oh, God.

11:50.886 --> 11:52.794
Oh, God. Are you okay?

12:04.202 --> 12:06.071
Good. You got my text.

12:06.709 --> 12:08.104
All eight of 'em.

12:08.364 --> 12:10.254
I could've sent a squad car.

12:10.379 --> 12:12.500
Last I checked, somebody
was still grounded.

12:12.970 --> 12:15.100
I let you slide for the stunt you
pulled over at the Cottonmouth,

12:15.126 --> 12:17.231
but that was not one
of your best moments.

12:17.251 --> 12:18.815
Yeah, I know. I get it.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.251
I get it, too.

12:21.604 --> 12:23.688
You've been juggling a lot lately.

12:24.244 --> 12:27.511
So, I figured I would back up,
you know, just make some ribs,

12:27.543 --> 12:29.714
have game night at the
house, just me and you.

12:29.787 --> 12:31.635
- That's my punishment?
- Ha-ha.

12:33.037 --> 12:34.149
Unfortunately,

12:34.178 --> 12:36.663
I just landed this really
time-sensitive case,

12:36.692 --> 12:39.868
so, I was thinking we could just
spend the quality time together here.

12:41.373 --> 12:42.939
Or I could extend your grounding.

12:44.912 --> 12:46.697
Quality time it is.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.015
Just sit here, while
you work on your case.

12:49.044 --> 12:51.190
Oh, no, no. You're gonna
talk to me. Let me have that.

12:51.843 --> 12:53.841
Texting your friends the
whole night kinda defeats

12:53.849 --> 12:55.952
the purpose of said quality
time, don't you think?

12:56.554 --> 12:57.619
Thank you.

12:59.464 --> 13:00.776
Where do you want delivery from?

13:09.959 --> 13:11.334
How did you get in this room?

13:13.291 --> 13:16.354
You wanna pretend that
protection spells and trinkets

13:16.382 --> 13:17.807
can keep me out of it?

13:19.611 --> 13:21.144
I was curious.

13:22.881 --> 13:25.615
I wanted to see where
you spend your days.

13:27.838 --> 13:30.091
I do miss you sometimes.

13:30.291 --> 13:31.521
You were my favorite.

13:31.746 --> 13:33.532
The Artful Dodger had nothing on me.

13:33.602 --> 13:35.343
I didn't hear you complaining about it

13:35.360 --> 13:37.930
when I filled your
belly full of cornbread.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.714
It was easier then between us,

13:40.999 --> 13:42.398
when you were younger.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.431
You should know better
than anybody else.

13:46.004 --> 13:48.288
The story gets more
complicated as it goes on.

13:48.573 --> 13:52.608
Doesn't mean that I don't
ever consider a different path.

13:53.221 --> 13:54.954
But brevity aside,

13:56.012 --> 13:58.706
ours was a wonderful tale.

13:59.176 --> 14:02.331
We both know that you fit
better with the Hastings,

14:03.819 --> 14:06.978
and I see that they've come
to think of you as family.

14:07.820 --> 14:08.800
After all...

14:12.013 --> 14:15.699
Your blood is kept
with the rest of theirs.

14:18.151 --> 14:19.269
So...

14:20.171 --> 14:22.243
Given how they feel about you,

14:23.277 --> 14:24.552
I'm curious.

14:25.777 --> 14:28.088
Why don't the Hastings know

14:28.549 --> 14:31.320
how you've come to be
everything that you are?

14:31.872 --> 14:34.100
I'll tell them when I'm ready.

14:34.839 --> 14:36.470
Or have you forgotten?

14:36.519 --> 14:39.327
It's my story to tell.

14:39.838 --> 14:44.571
But to keep a story as
good as yours on a shelf...

14:45.131 --> 14:46.476
We both know

14:47.314 --> 14:48.961
that's a missed opportunity.

14:52.439 --> 14:53.780
The truth will come out.

14:54.272 --> 14:55.959
It always does.

14:57.271 --> 15:00.701
And what uncomfortable truth are
you trying to ring out of Calvin?

15:03.223 --> 15:05.834
You may be wary of
me being in your home,

15:05.959 --> 15:07.273
but trust me,

15:07.890 --> 15:13.210
the Hastings would rather learn
their hidden truths from my methods,

15:13.420 --> 15:17.323
as opposed to the ones
implemented by The Dredge.

15:22.785 --> 15:25.212
I... I don't even have the
words to describe. It felt...

15:25.943 --> 15:27.231
Real.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.847
How the hell does reliving
this connect us to The Dredge?

15:31.307 --> 15:33.979
You know, I've known Aunt
Nancy for a long time.

15:35.145 --> 15:37.649
And when she senses trouble brewing,

15:38.287 --> 15:41.117
she's usually right to some degree.

15:42.614 --> 15:45.194
- I mean, her process may be questionable...
- Questionable?

15:46.067 --> 15:48.499
She gave me pie. She should
have given me a heads-up

15:48.575 --> 15:50.113
that I was gonna be
trapped in my own head.

15:50.144 --> 15:52.954
And clearly, there's more to
this process than remembering.

15:53.015 --> 15:55.835
It's because she uses a method
that taps into your soul.

15:55.917 --> 15:57.843
That really sounds like it's gonna hurt.

15:58.972 --> 16:02.135
You see, Aunt Nancy isn't
showing you a memory.

16:02.727 --> 16:04.251
You're literally reliving it.

16:04.285 --> 16:05.894
See, she does that by

16:05.914 --> 16:08.786
tapping into the lines
that run through all of us.

16:09.021 --> 16:11.646
Okay, so now that crazy
talk about spider webs

16:11.667 --> 16:14.048
-  is starting to make sense.
- People go to therapy, right?

16:14.063 --> 16:17.078
Because metaphorically speaking,
your memories can hurt you.

16:17.471 --> 16:18.600
It's the same thing.

16:18.988 --> 16:22.120
Except, Aunt Nancy did not tell
you about that little detail

16:22.145 --> 16:24.230
that when you're reliving
in that altered state,

16:24.276 --> 16:26.325
- it can also...
- Kill you.

16:27.260 --> 16:28.987
You were literally re-injured.

16:29.718 --> 16:32.190
- And if Tilly hadn't pulled you out...
- You'd be dead.

16:33.104 --> 16:36.182
The best stories are tinged with danger.

16:36.984 --> 16:40.392
Well, if that doesn't sound like
a reason enough not to get back

16:40.412 --> 16:42.701
onboard the crazy train,
I don't know what does.

16:42.742 --> 16:44.540
Agreed.

16:45.593 --> 16:47.478
Which is why I'll go instead.

16:47.519 --> 16:49.124
- What? No!
- Ma. No, no.

16:49.155 --> 16:50.672
You almost died that day, too.

16:50.754 --> 16:52.940
So, I should do nothing and we just wait

16:52.955 --> 16:54.596
for this new infernal to come for us?

16:54.642 --> 16:57.038
We need to know what
this fight is about.

16:57.064 --> 16:58.632
- We need answers.
- Well,

16:58.653 --> 17:00.953
what if you go and I
lose you in the past, too?

17:01.029 --> 17:04.906
You don't have to unspool
the thread of your story.

17:05.740 --> 17:09.449
But the pages you've
traversed have shown me this.

17:14.412 --> 17:17.413
If the answers are
not found in the past,

17:18.650 --> 17:21.617
you will lose your
other son in the present.

17:30.685 --> 17:32.481
I don't like this at all.

17:32.606 --> 17:34.565
Look, I appreciate your concern.

17:35.453 --> 17:38.902
Don't forget, I'm well-versed
in taking on the unexpected.

17:39.653 --> 17:42.647
I'd say finding out Dad killed
Arlo was unexpected enough.

17:43.082 --> 17:45.764
Now we're being told there's
more hell wrapped up in that day.

17:46.050 --> 17:47.260
You know, maybe we should just let

17:47.275 --> 17:49.401
whatever's in the
shadows just stay there.

17:50.407 --> 17:54.219
If Aunt Nancy told you
Garvey's life was on the line,

17:54.689 --> 17:57.698
you would be back in that memory
looking for clues, you would.

17:58.726 --> 17:59.937
Well, it doesn't change the fact that

17:59.937 --> 18:02.098
this soul cord stuff is dangerous.

18:02.635 --> 18:05.818
It also doesn't change the
fact that your memories alone

18:05.858 --> 18:07.718
can't provide the answer.

18:08.597 --> 18:11.656
Whether trauma or
magic, for some reason,

18:12.265 --> 18:14.722
Calvin's memories fail him.

18:15.984 --> 18:17.119
Well...

18:17.804 --> 18:21.008
As much as I do like
a good family drama,

18:21.641 --> 18:23.240
I think it's time to begin.

18:24.114 --> 18:25.207
Again.

18:40.147 --> 18:42.451
- No talking you out of this, is there?
- No.

18:49.426 --> 18:51.265
I'm gonna be holding
your hand the entire time.

18:53.161 --> 18:55.633
It's easy to get lost in there, so...

18:56.150 --> 18:58.797
If you hear me call your
name, just answer, okay?

18:59.180 --> 19:00.432
I'll be listening.

19:42.802 --> 19:45.286
I'm worried about our little boy's

19:45.342 --> 19:47.058
pushing when he should be pulling,

19:47.370 --> 19:49.153
talking when he should be listening.

19:49.327 --> 19:51.109
He's smart and bright,

19:51.234 --> 19:53.460
just maybe too bright for his own good.

19:53.710 --> 19:55.779
Fathers and sons clash.

19:56.883 --> 19:58.032
Thankfully,

19:58.476 --> 20:00.044
we have Calvin to look after him, too.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.768
Yeah, and two boys that can't
swim can drown each other.

20:03.973 --> 20:05.873
Hey, wait, I'm sorry.

20:06.384 --> 20:07.759
You asked me here to talk

20:07.884 --> 20:09.281
and here I am blabbing.

20:09.573 --> 20:10.865
What you got on your mind?

20:12.398 --> 20:14.018
Uh, I've...

20:14.268 --> 20:17.650
I have some concerning
news about Calvin and May.

20:19.356 --> 20:22.059
Don't tell me he let that good
one slip through his fingers.

20:22.269 --> 20:25.359
Hmm, she reminds me of you, Bea.

20:26.080 --> 20:29.288
We Hastings men, we need a good
woman that keep us centered,

20:30.076 --> 20:33.050
on track, in line.

20:34.143 --> 20:36.574
May told me a secret.

20:37.704 --> 20:41.560
One that she wants me to
keep from Calvin for now.

20:42.097 --> 20:43.573
She's pregnant.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.657
We're gonna be grandparents?

20:48.763 --> 20:50.894
Oh, wow.

20:51.019 --> 20:53.700
Girl, you'll be the
youngest, finest granny ever.

20:53.705 --> 20:55.662
Grandma!

20:55.738 --> 20:57.858
Ah! Grandma!

21:01.011 --> 21:02.860
Whoo! Man.

21:02.866 --> 21:04.658
- You...
- What?

21:04.704 --> 21:06.040
You just, you...

21:06.165 --> 21:08.833
I don't know. You've seen
it all and done it all and...

21:09.635 --> 21:11.030
What I love about you is, you...

21:11.155 --> 21:14.489
- You still live in the moment.
- It is a good moment.

21:14.614 --> 21:16.405
On the other side of that,

21:17.387 --> 21:19.738
our baby is going to have
a baby of his own soon.

21:19.840 --> 21:21.570
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you sure

21:21.610 --> 21:25.098
the family business is what we
want Calvin and Arlo committing to?

21:25.130 --> 21:26.444
Well...

21:27.715 --> 21:29.615
It's in their blood, Bea.

21:30.391 --> 21:31.796
It's their duty.

21:33.922 --> 21:36.572
One that you yourself
has struggled with.

21:36.598 --> 21:38.890
True. But look around you.

21:40.033 --> 21:43.884
So many of these people,
they have empty lives,

21:44.231 --> 21:45.991
looking for a reason.

21:46.585 --> 21:48.099
And then there's us.

21:49.069 --> 21:52.123
And the good we do, the
good that only we can do

21:52.174 --> 21:54.239
far outweighs the burden.

21:55.450 --> 21:57.769
And you know that I'm
not lying when I say,

21:58.037 --> 22:00.208
Calvin's a natural at it.

22:00.713 --> 22:02.061
Natural.

22:02.386 --> 22:04.960
Doesn't necessarily mean natural fit.

22:05.599 --> 22:07.852
Are you saying you want Calvin

22:08.395 --> 22:10.267
to walk away from his true calling?

22:10.312 --> 22:13.250
No, I'm... I'm saying that you

22:13.896 --> 22:15.952
need to tell him everything.

22:17.792 --> 22:20.761
The best of it, the darkest parts, too.

22:22.645 --> 22:25.003
And then he can pick his path.

22:27.408 --> 22:28.980
And after all, it's...

22:30.444 --> 22:32.288
It's not just

22:33.047 --> 22:35.533
his life to consider anymore. It's...

22:36.127 --> 22:37.916
It's our grandkids, too.

22:57.025 --> 22:59.585
Russ had better not be sending
you anything more scandalous

22:59.604 --> 23:01.526
than some smiley face emojis.

23:01.651 --> 23:03.148
Is that why I'm in jail?

23:03.212 --> 23:05.058
Keep my virginity locked up.

23:05.492 --> 23:07.356
Everything below is off-limits.

23:07.370 --> 23:09.158
So everything above it is fair game.

23:10.065 --> 23:12.205
We're not Gilmore Girls open.

23:12.268 --> 23:14.519
I'm not about to share every
detail of my life with you.

23:14.925 --> 23:16.752
You can trust me.

23:17.327 --> 23:19.843
As of late, I haven't been
able to trust you with anything.

23:20.047 --> 23:22.564
You've been sneaking around,
dabbling in mysticism.

23:22.596 --> 23:24.129
That's a part of who I am.

23:24.254 --> 23:26.127
And that is why I need the Hastings

23:26.172 --> 23:28.567
to go over the list of dangers
that come along with it.

23:29.072 --> 23:30.930
So that's what that was.

23:31.055 --> 23:32.897
Hey, we just happened
to run into the man

23:32.910 --> 23:34.832
who followed you at the
Cottonmouth for lunch.

23:34.896 --> 23:36.519
Force us to spend quality time together.

23:36.519 --> 23:38.760
Not the smoothest play,
but still the right one.

23:39.061 --> 23:41.162
Your father is the only one
who can help you navigate

23:41.215 --> 23:42.848
what you've been born into, Garvey.

23:43.084 --> 23:46.507
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly
my decision to keep him away.

23:49.590 --> 23:52.836
I made a judgment call
to protect you. Okay?

23:52.875 --> 23:54.982
I thought I could keep you away
from the creepiness in the world,

23:54.995 --> 23:57.706
but apparently, I can't. So, new call.

23:57.725 --> 23:59.784
You will make an attempt
to get to know your father.

23:59.836 --> 24:02.557
- Stop calling him that.
- That is who he is.

24:02.604 --> 24:04.193
Donating DNA doesn't mean

24:04.217 --> 24:06.131
I need to send him a
card every year mid-June.

24:06.144 --> 24:08.372
You can call him the tooth fairy,
if you want to. I don't care.

24:08.404 --> 24:09.649
You will get to know him.

24:09.662 --> 24:11.731
He's the only one who can
help you with the path.

24:11.776 --> 24:13.635
I have made it this far.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.742
I think me and my path
are doing just fine.

24:23.610 --> 24:25.257
I can handle this.

24:28.036 --> 24:30.930
Famous last words from every
teenager throughout time.

24:49.521 --> 24:50.816
Are they coming for us?

24:50.918 --> 24:52.317
What?

24:52.419 --> 24:55.262
- Did we do that?
- All right, you just stay here.

25:16.777 --> 25:18.366
Hmm.

25:18.813 --> 25:20.645
Thank you.

25:31.317 --> 25:33.757
It is glorious to finally be out.

25:35.091 --> 25:36.286
No.

25:37.327 --> 25:39.402
Get back in. I... I command you.

25:41.561 --> 25:43.490
You're scared of this, aren't you?

25:43.771 --> 25:46.856
That's no magic lamp and I'm no genie.

25:47.291 --> 25:51.135
You turned the key on the prison
that's held me for centuries.

25:51.454 --> 25:53.855
Okay, well, you don't
have to get back in,

25:54.060 --> 25:55.670
but could you just go away?

25:55.795 --> 25:57.582
I promise I won't tell anybody.

25:57.684 --> 25:59.189
I promise.

25:59.314 --> 26:01.150
I recall that custom.

26:01.188 --> 26:02.804
You cross your heart.

26:02.856 --> 26:04.899
So do you now hope to die?

26:05.288 --> 26:07.064
If I'm the one that got you out,

26:07.527 --> 26:09.140
I'm the one that can put you back in.

26:09.265 --> 26:12.297
But your father hasn't
taught you to do that, has he?

26:12.399 --> 26:14.249
Otherwise, you would have done so.

26:14.601 --> 26:17.736
I can't touch the ring,
but because you can,

26:17.838 --> 26:20.113
together we can unleash my brethren.

26:20.974 --> 26:22.470
I'm not helping you do anything.

26:22.709 --> 26:25.414
You have little choice, boy.

26:25.605 --> 26:27.212
Hey, get away from my brother

26:27.246 --> 26:28.920
before I kick your ugly gray ass.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.525
Calvin.

26:35.575 --> 26:38.290
Is this that gray ass-kicking
you were talking about?

26:40.527 --> 26:42.805
There's a darkness in your soul.

26:48.937 --> 26:50.456
Calvin.

27:06.282 --> 27:11.886
Like chains, families are only
as strong as the weakest link.

27:11.988 --> 27:13.565
But the weakest infernal

27:13.690 --> 27:16.515
sets dimensional shift
traps to pick on boys.

27:16.559 --> 27:18.528
You want to get your fight on?

27:18.961 --> 27:20.974
Come on up to the womens' department.

27:20.997 --> 27:22.423
Bitch.

27:22.548 --> 27:24.565
And what's to be found there?

27:24.667 --> 27:26.996
The source of your son's weakness?

27:39.815 --> 27:41.875
Mom! Mom!

27:43.953 --> 27:45.376
Ugh.

27:45.586 --> 27:47.170
Tilly!

27:48.281 --> 27:50.257
Ma, come back to me.

27:50.359 --> 27:52.113
- Come back!
- What is it? What?

27:52.128 --> 27:53.825
You got that taser charged up?

27:53.863 --> 27:56.283
Oh, yeah, the spirit and the Holy Ghost.

28:02.238 --> 28:03.737
It's happening.

28:08.844 --> 28:10.978
Better improvise, Till.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.672
'Cause her heart just stopped.

28:23.759 --> 28:25.893
Okay.

28:26.762 --> 28:28.902
You always were clever.

28:30.097 --> 28:32.836
And you remain duplicitous.

28:32.849 --> 28:34.382
If you want your family safe,

28:34.403 --> 28:36.349
kick her the hell out of this house!

28:56.428 --> 28:58.659
What else did you see?

28:58.761 --> 29:00.849
She saw Arlo's mistake.

29:01.764 --> 29:03.588
What does that mean?

29:05.863 --> 29:07.979
This house is fortified.

29:08.921 --> 29:12.316
No malevolent spirit should have
been able to enter that night.

29:12.330 --> 29:16.115
The only way they could have is
if a spirit was tied to one of us.

29:16.145 --> 29:17.544
No.

29:17.647 --> 29:19.646
No, we promised each other
not to mess with anything

29:19.649 --> 29:21.382
Isaac hadn't shown us how to use.

29:21.638 --> 29:24.148
- He wouldn't have gone against that.
- What if he was tricked?

29:24.644 --> 29:27.438
The infernal used Arlo to get free.

29:28.024 --> 29:30.480
And it was after
something in your study.

29:30.760 --> 29:33.371
That study is filled with thousands

29:33.496 --> 29:36.904
of weapons and writings and relics.
It could've been after anything.

29:37.266 --> 29:39.120
Mom, was there anything
else you remember?

29:39.171 --> 29:42.065
She did wake in the Cottonmouth.

29:45.961 --> 29:47.935
What does one thing have
to do with the other?

29:50.313 --> 29:51.578
Mom?

29:51.681 --> 29:53.180
Your future...

29:53.209 --> 29:56.013
After Arlo passed, I...

29:56.819 --> 30:00.721
Spoke with Isaac about helping
you pick a quieter path.

30:00.823 --> 30:03.624
One different from all
these deathlessness.

30:05.594 --> 30:07.427
You knew May was pregnant.

30:08.103 --> 30:09.987
Ma, how could you keep that from me?

30:15.771 --> 30:20.347
No matter their age, parents
protect their children from monsters.

30:22.178 --> 30:25.201
Arlo's death became something
I couldn't guard you from.

30:25.681 --> 30:27.794
You were no good to yourself.

30:27.919 --> 30:31.211
And May could see at that time
that you would be no good to her.

30:31.620 --> 30:33.220
Your Garvey...

30:33.322 --> 30:34.691
She was right.

30:36.492 --> 30:38.811
How could you not respect her wishes?

30:39.169 --> 30:42.483
Clearly your future
is important, Calvin.

30:42.965 --> 30:46.333
That infernal didn't just
wanna end your family,

30:46.435 --> 30:48.715
it wanted to end your legacy.

30:53.486 --> 30:55.102
Pop always said,

30:56.245 --> 30:58.155
this ring was our legacy.

31:01.807 --> 31:04.950
Arlo must have stood his ground
against the infernal to keep it.

31:05.075 --> 31:06.566
Your father has secrets

31:06.579 --> 31:08.661
regarding that ring
that even I don't know.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.627
And things he'd planned to
teach you when he saw you ready.

31:13.729 --> 31:16.925
Pop may have had a
plan, but he's not here.

31:17.232 --> 31:19.460
You said you wanted to
help me choose a path,

31:20.112 --> 31:23.253
but I need to know the truth
to know that I can handle it.

31:24.607 --> 31:27.813
I get the pull to see the truth, I do.

31:28.037 --> 31:31.262
But, Calvin, we both tried
and we didn't get any answers.

31:31.300 --> 31:32.871
This time it will be different.

31:32.916 --> 31:35.282
This time we'll go into
the memories together.

31:36.417 --> 31:40.147
Once combined, we can find
a way to help the family.

31:42.792 --> 31:44.261
Well,

31:45.053 --> 31:47.417
let's find a bigger room.

31:50.482 --> 31:53.017
So, I've been doing some thinking...

31:53.362 --> 31:55.796
And it seems the more
salacious the ending,

31:55.994 --> 31:57.814
the more you like the story.

31:57.857 --> 32:00.381
Not that you'll believe this,

32:00.663 --> 32:04.086
but this journey taken
ultimately will keep you safe.

32:04.211 --> 32:07.197
The Dredge has designs on that ring.

32:09.769 --> 32:11.551
I don't know what exactly.

32:11.596 --> 32:13.033
Right.

32:13.439 --> 32:14.972
But you know something.

32:15.074 --> 32:21.770
I know that he told me either I
help him acquire it, or when he does,

32:21.949 --> 32:24.363
he swore there will be a reckoning.

32:25.785 --> 32:27.384
And to that end,

32:27.486 --> 32:31.362
I apologize in advance for
what's about to happen next.

32:39.632 --> 32:41.287
What the hell are you doing?

32:41.300 --> 32:44.802
I'm bombarding them with
the memory repeatedly.

32:48.107 --> 32:50.209
They led you how far?

32:53.412 --> 32:57.273
No, I know how far you are, that's
a pretty big soup of the area.

32:59.752 --> 33:01.499
All is well here.

33:03.167 --> 33:04.482
Okay.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.680
Okay, bye.

33:29.563 --> 33:30.554
If we're gonna end this,

33:30.555 --> 33:32.716
we're gonna need Arlo and
Isaac's account of that night.

33:32.818 --> 33:35.052
Since they're not here, I
got you the next best thing.

33:39.373 --> 33:42.629
Blood is a mystical representation
of a person's whole life,

33:42.661 --> 33:44.023
and this is theirs.

33:45.352 --> 33:48.030
You remain quite the clever girl.

34:06.081 --> 34:09.013
I'm eager to see how this story ends.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.802
Arlo...

34:25.556 --> 34:26.967
What happened to Mom?

34:28.407 --> 34:29.690
Arlo!

34:35.031 --> 34:36.277
It's inside of me.

34:38.862 --> 34:40.784
Shut up, boy.

34:42.688 --> 34:45.367
It's gonna reach hundreds of
infernals and kill everyone.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.924
You gotta shoot me.

34:47.025 --> 34:48.965
I messed up and I let it out.

34:49.090 --> 34:50.971
You gotta help me make this right.

35:01.753 --> 35:03.774
No, dark soul.

35:04.129 --> 35:06.555
Your future will bring death to others.

35:06.579 --> 35:09.334
And I will unleash hell upon your world

35:09.381 --> 35:11.859
that hasn't been seen since Solomon.

35:16.055 --> 35:17.598
Pull the trigger, Calvin.

35:17.723 --> 35:19.313
Or people are gonna die.

35:20.324 --> 35:22.025
It's the only way. Do it!

35:25.500 --> 35:29.143
The sons of the great
infernal hunter, will fall.

35:29.268 --> 35:31.678
And from your bones
I will forge a weapon

35:31.719 --> 35:34.273
that will kill your un-killlable father.

35:35.663 --> 35:37.942
You're as weak as your brother.

36:31.112 --> 36:32.274
Calvin.

36:32.492 --> 36:33.738
Why?

36:35.307 --> 36:38.056
Because we don't see things as they are,

36:38.669 --> 36:40.677
we see things as we are.

36:42.588 --> 36:45.765
What I wanna see is you leave.

36:46.118 --> 36:49.035
Our stories are part of life's tapestry.

36:49.071 --> 36:50.578
Leave!

37:06.538 --> 37:07.724
You lied.

37:13.655 --> 37:15.299
You lied to me.

37:17.271 --> 37:18.528
You let them do it.

37:18.549 --> 37:20.342
Only to protect you.

37:20.408 --> 37:23.347
- From the fact that I'm a monster?
- No, son, no.

37:24.160 --> 37:28.170
That thing was right. I
do, I have a dark soul, Ma.

37:29.918 --> 37:31.333
Calvin...

37:32.151 --> 37:34.353
My heart broke for Arlo.

37:35.564 --> 37:40.674
But in those final minutes he
embraced the burden of our legacy,

37:40.690 --> 37:45.046
and the two of you together kept
hundreds of horrors locked away.

37:45.077 --> 37:47.309
And maybe that's why
your dark soul is needed.

37:47.319 --> 37:48.724
I failed him.

37:49.470 --> 37:50.952
I failed Arlo.

37:51.825 --> 37:53.931
- And worse, I blamed Pop for it.
- Calvin.

37:53.977 --> 37:58.248
Being a parent means you protect
your children as best as you can.

38:00.553 --> 38:03.362
Your daughter will be
facing her own choices soon.

38:03.950 --> 38:06.432
When you look into her eyes,

38:08.864 --> 38:11.889
maybe you'll understand why
your father did what he did.

38:13.646 --> 38:15.005
But I don't.

38:20.262 --> 38:21.816
I don't understand it yet.

38:43.913 --> 38:44.980
Hey.

38:45.471 --> 38:47.064
I need a bourbon.

38:49.543 --> 38:51.468
Mmm. Two fingers.

38:53.583 --> 38:55.452
Heck of a night for you, too, huh?

38:59.438 --> 39:00.592
Yeah.

39:01.537 --> 39:02.978
Bea, can I ask you something?

39:06.028 --> 39:07.933
Do you think I made the right decision

39:08.058 --> 39:11.310
in keeping Garvey and Calvin apart?

39:26.415 --> 39:28.025
With kids,

39:30.447 --> 39:33.461
sometimes it takes years to learn
you've made the right decision.

39:36.353 --> 39:38.152
And the day you go through gut,

39:38.851 --> 39:40.511
and pray you're right by them.

39:41.794 --> 39:43.107
My gut...

39:43.505 --> 39:46.018
My gut tells me they need to talk.

39:48.460 --> 39:50.458
I feel like he's the
only one who can help her.

39:53.011 --> 39:55.496
Or maybe she's the only
one who can help him.

40:22.769 --> 40:24.765
Sometimes I come here to think.

40:25.261 --> 40:26.869
That's your favorite spot, too?

40:28.898 --> 40:32.629
Look, I don't get most
of what the family does,

40:33.402 --> 40:35.069
but I know it's important.

40:35.254 --> 40:39.149
I'm just not so sure I can
handle the weight of it all.

40:39.175 --> 40:40.541
Neither am I.

40:41.570 --> 40:43.180
Sometimes I think I can.

40:44.080 --> 40:46.549
Sometimes, not so much.

40:46.575 --> 40:47.915
Yeah?

40:50.620 --> 40:53.220
Do you know what I do when I
don't know which way to go in life?

40:54.608 --> 40:56.257
I get pancakes.

40:57.660 --> 40:59.467
Bigger the problem,
the higher the stack.

41:01.158 --> 41:03.130
Or maybe we can get some now.

41:03.814 --> 41:04.963
Maybe,

41:05.382 --> 41:07.457
over them you can tell me
how you deal with everything

41:07.482 --> 41:09.503
when it just gets so bad.

41:11.140 --> 41:13.322
I was kinda hoping you
could tell me the same thing.

41:21.350 --> 41:22.683
So, the Cottonmouth?

41:30.293 --> 41:31.771
I guess that means a rain check?

41:34.627 --> 41:35.990
Unfortunately.

41:37.133 --> 41:38.766
You got monsters to slay...

41:39.051 --> 41:40.168
Dad.

41:41.764 --> 41:43.889
It's okay, really. I get it.

41:44.140 --> 41:45.739
I'll hold you to that rain check.

41:48.444 --> 41:49.610
Make sure you do.

41:54.717 --> 41:56.283
I got your text, I'm on the way.

42:09.546 --> 42:11.098
Does my family amuse you?

42:11.670 --> 42:13.269
Only their father.

42:13.719 --> 42:16.718
But you might wanna
thank me for saving them,

42:17.111 --> 42:19.607
or at least delaying their slaughter.

42:21.844 --> 42:25.000
I think it'd be wise you
leave them the hell alone.

42:31.088 --> 42:32.943
Welcome back, Isaac.
