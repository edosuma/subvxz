01:05.519 --> 01:07.800
I didn't do anything. I am innocent.

01:07.880 --> 01:10.000
I was wrongly convicted.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.440
I didn't harm Kathleen,

01:12.520 --> 01:15.480
and I didn't believe
until the jury clerk read the sentence

01:15.920 --> 01:17.440
that I would be convicted.

01:20.240 --> 01:23.520
My immediate reaction was...
"Let's end it."

01:23.600 --> 01:26.520
And I told David
that I didn't want an appeal.

01:26.600 --> 01:29.040
I wanted to just end it right now.

01:29.320 --> 01:31.000
Forget it. Enough was enough.

01:31.640 --> 01:33.000
We had all suffered enough.

01:34.000 --> 01:37.840
And that-- that wonderful,
awful line from Romeo and Juliet...

01:38.480 --> 01:40.880
that-- that "All are punishéd."

01:43.760 --> 01:45.520
I don't know
what we were being punished for.

01:45.600 --> 01:49.400
I don't why my children
had to suffer what they did.

01:49.480 --> 01:50.640
Why they were being punished.

01:50.720 --> 01:55.120
But I did feel that,
let this end right now.

02:15.680 --> 02:20.560
I have been here almost 3,000 days.
Over eight years.

02:21.800 --> 02:25.360
When I first got here, I thought,
"Well, I'll be out in a couple of years."

02:25.440 --> 02:29.960
We appealed. And we kept appealing,
and every one of them failed.

02:30.720 --> 02:32.760
And after eight years, I'm still here.

02:32.840 --> 02:36.840
And I began to think, "I may die in here."

02:37.760 --> 02:41.080
It's been almost ten years
since Kathleen died.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.480
But...

02:44.280 --> 02:47.920
Well, there's this wonderful photograph
in my locker of-- of her.

02:48.000 --> 02:49.720
Every time I open it, I see it.

02:49.800 --> 02:54.160
And, uh, it's of Kathleen
in the Imperial Gardens in Tokyo.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.760
And she's looking for Japanese

02:56.840 --> 03:00.520
because there aren't any,
uh, in downtown Tokyo,

03:00.600 --> 03:02.680
because it's not cherry blossom time.

03:03.320 --> 03:05.320
And that's how it always was with her.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.480
We were always joking
and we were always laughing.

03:09.360 --> 03:10.360
So...

03:12.080 --> 03:14.600
Even though it's been ten years,

03:15.360 --> 03:16.880
it's just like yesterday.

03:17.840 --> 03:19.200
She's just as alive to me,

03:19.280 --> 03:25.160
and I love her as much today
as I did ten years ago.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.280
One of the most awful things
that could ever befall somebody

03:44.480 --> 03:45.920
is to think to yourself,

03:46.720 --> 03:50.640
"The only way I'm ever going
to get out of here is in a coffin."

03:52.040 --> 03:55.040
And that thought,
I won't say it occurred to me often,

03:55.120 --> 04:00.320
but every so often
it would flip-- flit across my mind.

04:00.480 --> 04:02.200
Uh, and I would think to myself...

04:03.920 --> 04:08.160
"Boy, uh, he's there until he dies."

04:09.800 --> 04:12.040
And it was only when all this...

04:13.560 --> 04:16.839
uh, publicity started coming out
about Deaver...

04:18.000 --> 04:24.040
that I started feeling like maybe,
maybe there was a chance.

04:33.920 --> 04:35.160
The decision.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.000
Judge Calvin E. Murphy rules
Gregory F. Taylor has proved

04:40.080 --> 04:42.480
- by clear and convincing evidence...
-

04:42.880 --> 04:46.360
...that Gregory F. Taylor is innocent
of the charge of first-degree murder

04:46.440 --> 04:49.960
of Jacquetta Thomas on September 26, 1991.

04:51.320 --> 04:53.840
A Wake County man
who spent 17 years in prison

04:53.920 --> 04:57.720
has been exonerated by the North Carolina
Innocence Commission in Raleigh.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.560
Greg Taylor, who had been condemned
to life in prison in 1993,

05:01.640 --> 05:03.000
is now a free man.

05:04.560 --> 05:06.360
The commission's three-judge panel

05:06.440 --> 05:10.400
centered around the testimony
of one SBI agent, Duane Deaver.

05:10.920 --> 05:14.960
Deaver admits to having misrepresented
blood test results in the Taylor case.

05:15.320 --> 05:18.640
The SBI has announced plans
for an internal investigation.

05:19.000 --> 05:20.840
"Deaver is a major character

05:20.920 --> 05:23.720
in the emerging story
of the SBI's troubles.

05:24.440 --> 05:25.880
At the bureau's crime labs,

05:25.960 --> 05:28.280
where Deaver had been
a key agent and trainer,

05:28.880 --> 05:33.200
analysts charged with using science
to solve crimes have hidden test results

05:33.640 --> 05:37.800
or concocted bizarre experiments
to shore up a prosecutor's case."

05:44.480 --> 05:46.080
I interviewed Tonya Rogers,

05:46.160 --> 05:49.280
who was one of jurors
in the Michael Peterson trial.

05:49.960 --> 05:52.760
And she said that Deaver's testimony

05:52.840 --> 05:57.560
was the most important evidence
presented at the trial.

05:58.320 --> 06:01.720
Ms. Rogers said that
during the jury's deliberations,

06:02.080 --> 06:05.800
they started off split, uh, 6-6 or 8-4,

06:06.240 --> 06:10.120
but as they talked,
the most powerful evidence

06:10.400 --> 06:13.600
that moved the jury to come 12-0
for a conviction

06:13.680 --> 06:17.920
was that bloodstain on the inside
of Michael Peterson's shorts.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.720
The jury was convinced
by Deaver's testimony

06:20.800 --> 06:24.120
that the only way the bloodstain
could have arrived there

06:24.200 --> 06:25.280
was through an assault.

06:30.240 --> 06:33.560
When I heard what Deaver
had done in the Greg Taylor case,

06:33.640 --> 06:38.120
it became clear to me
that I might be able to finally prove

06:38.200 --> 06:42.880
that what he had done in Michael's case
was the same sort of thing.

06:42.960 --> 06:44.200
In other words,

06:44.280 --> 06:50.000
ignore the facts, ignore the science,

06:50.440 --> 06:55.000
and do what you need to do
to get a conviction.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.520
Ten years ago next Friday,

06:56.600 --> 06:58.160
Kathleen Peterson was found dead

06:58.240 --> 07:00.400
at the bottom of a staircase
in their home.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.240
Almost two years after that,

07:02.320 --> 07:05.280
her husband, Mike Peterson,
was found guilty of murder

07:05.360 --> 07:07.040
and sentenced to life in prison.

07:07.360 --> 07:10.520
Now, Mike Peterson hopes a hearing
that could begin next week

07:10.600 --> 07:12.080
will give him a new chance at freedom.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.480
The District Attorney's Office
has seen turnover

07:16.560 --> 07:19.360
since Peterson's murder trial in 2003.

07:19.800 --> 07:24.000
The original DA, Jim Hardin,
is now a superior court judge.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.360
Freda Black, the assistant DA at the time

07:26.440 --> 07:29.000
is no longer with
the District Attorney's Office.

07:30.040 --> 07:33.560
Tracey Cline, who is Durham's current DA
will represent the State.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.800
But some of the key players
have remained the same.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.880
Orlando Hudson,
Durham County's Superior Court Judge,

07:39.960 --> 07:42.800
and David Rudolf,
who is taking on the case pro bono,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.280
are back on the case.

07:54.720 --> 07:56.240
Oh, wow!

07:56.320 --> 07:57.840
- Hi!
- It's Ron Guerette!

07:57.920 --> 07:59.800
Martha,
Ron Guerette just walked in.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.440
- Oh, my God. Hi!
- Hey, girl.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.000
I'm gonna get up and hug you.

08:04.080 --> 08:06.720
I'm on the phone with Martha,
with my sister.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.440
- You're not a kid anymore.
- I know!

08:08.920 --> 08:10.520
What have you been up to?

08:10.880 --> 08:12.760
Just working
in this crazy world.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.840
Yeah, I know what you mean.

08:14.920 --> 08:18.440
He's trying to come back
from his near-bankruptcy in 2003

08:18.520 --> 08:20.600
as a result of working
on your father's case.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.520
- Still working on it.
- Wow, it's been eight years.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.760
- I can't believe it.
- Can't believe it.

08:27.960 --> 08:31.720
- You've gone from a kid to a young lady.
- Little kid? I was like 20!

08:31.800 --> 08:33.559
-
- You're still a kid.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.360
Yeah, I'm turning 30 on Saturday.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.159
- Is that right?
- Yeah, it's been ten years.

08:38.640 --> 08:40.080
- Wow.
- Yeah.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.880
Yeah, because Mom died on the 9th
and I turned 20 on the 10th and--

08:43.960 --> 08:45.440
Oh, that's right!

08:45.520 --> 08:47.840
- Whew. Man.
- Crazy.

08:47.920 --> 08:50.280
- That is crazy.
- Yeah, I'm married now.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.680
- Are you? Well, congratulations.
- Yeah.

08:53.120 --> 08:56.400
Well, one thing about Radisch,
Deaver and Butts

08:56.480 --> 08:58.840
is they have been
in this very courtroom before.

08:59.760 --> 09:02.080
They have. They've testified
in front of people like you.

09:02.520 --> 09:06.760
Agent Deaver, Dr. Radisch,
they are tried and true.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.680
Tried and true. Because they work for us.

09:10.320 --> 09:13.040
Now to hear them tell it,
that scene was altered.

09:13.360 --> 09:14.640
Well, if you believe that,

09:14.720 --> 09:17.320
then you just got to believe
that Duane Deaver is a liar!

09:17.400 --> 09:20.320
- Pleasant memories?
- He has no reason to lie to you.

09:20.400 --> 09:23.840
- Yeah. Wow, that one where--
- Oh, my God! Where she says--

09:23.920 --> 09:26.760
Where she says they'll be back,
that one gave me chills.

09:26.840 --> 09:29.600
And you have to believe
that Deaver's a liar?

09:29.680 --> 09:30.520
Guess what?

09:30.640 --> 09:33.000
And he tried
to get himself vindicated

09:33.080 --> 09:35.880
by blaming it on the SBI in general,
and that got him fired.

09:35.960 --> 09:36.800
Right.

09:37.120 --> 09:39.640
After editing stuff for you
for the Deaver clips,

09:39.720 --> 09:41.800
my husband watched it, too, and he goes,

09:41.880 --> 09:43.680
- "This guy's an idiot."
- Yeah.

09:43.760 --> 09:44.800
Just... argh.

09:45.880 --> 09:49.280
- Greg Taylor was let out.
- How long was he in prison?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.680
Seventeen years.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.520
- He was in there for a while.
- Oh, my God.

09:55.440 --> 09:56.920
That's terrible.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.160
Okay.

09:58.800 --> 10:03.200
Like it's just a little lie
that put someone away for 17 years.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.880
That's devastating. God.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.200
Greg Taylor.
I live in Durham, North Carolina.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.640
Forty-nine years old.

10:16.040 --> 10:20.800
When I was 29 years old,
I was arrested for first-degree murder

10:21.200 --> 10:27.680
and tried and convicted, uh, April 1993.

10:28.440 --> 10:34.160
Um, I was 31 years old at the time,
and I was married.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.200
Uh, had a nine-year-old daughter,

10:37.560 --> 10:43.680
and, um, after that, uh,
things just kind of fell apart.

10:50.600 --> 10:53.840
In the beginning,
you think that the next appeal

10:53.920 --> 10:57.240
you'll be free,
or the next motion filed in court.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.800
And then when those things let you down,

10:59.880 --> 11:01.480
you come to realize that,

11:01.560 --> 11:04.120
you know, if you've been let down
so many times so far,

11:04.200 --> 11:07.280
there's nothing to stop you
from being let down in the future.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.880
And it just went on interminably
and, um...

11:12.040 --> 11:16.040
Until finally, I had--
when I had exhausted all my appeals

11:16.480 --> 11:22.320
and, uh, you know, I realized
that the chances were very good

11:22.400 --> 11:26.000
that I was gonna die in prison,
and I had to learn how to deal with that.

11:49.200 --> 11:53.080
I don't have faith
in the system like I used to have,

11:53.560 --> 11:56.440
but I still believe, I hope,

11:56.520 --> 12:00.520
that justice will finally prevail
after eight years.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.800
And I'll get out of here.

12:03.960 --> 12:08.240
I want people to see
what Duane Deaver did.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.040
I want all of it to come out.

12:11.120 --> 12:16.360
I want people to see what that man did
not just to me, but to other people.

12:16.920 --> 12:21.880
He'd say these ridiculous things
and I just would not pay any attention--

12:21.960 --> 12:23.720
I mean, I wouldn't even listen anymore,

12:23.800 --> 12:25.920
thinking that nobody
could believe this nonsense

12:26.000 --> 12:30.640
of hitting, you know,
Kathleen 42 times or whatever it was.

12:30.720 --> 12:34.080
This-- this reenactment that he did,

12:34.160 --> 12:36.320
it was just all a lie.

12:36.960 --> 12:40.360
So, at the time, I just thought,

12:40.440 --> 12:44.160
"Well, this is-- this is just stupid,
nobody's going to believe this."

12:45.160 --> 12:46.000
But they did.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.960
I do think
that it's Michael's last chance.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.760
Uh, it's been eight years.

13:02.200 --> 13:07.920
He is now 68 years old,
and all of his appeals have been denied.

13:08.000 --> 13:11.720
And this is really the best opportunity

13:11.800 --> 13:15.000
that we're gonna have to prove
that he should never have been convicted.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.240
Thirteen, please.

13:18.720 --> 13:21.680
All right. They're saying
they took your clothes over yesterday.

13:21.760 --> 13:22.680
They're having them prepared.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.720
Okay. I guess this is for the car.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.280
Come on with me, please.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.600
I remember
just a couple nights ago,

13:36.680 --> 13:39.760
I dreamed I was there, an old man,

13:40.360 --> 13:42.840
lying on a gurney
at the end of a corridor.

13:45.320 --> 13:48.160
You go to central prison and you die.

13:48.520 --> 13:51.680
And you die alone. No family, no one.

13:52.360 --> 13:54.040
And you die on a gurney.

13:55.160 --> 13:57.760
And I remember having that dream
and waking up.

13:58.000 --> 14:01.960
Thinking, "No!"
But it was a pretty scary dream.

14:27.320 --> 14:29.360
Mike, is this going to be--

14:30.800 --> 14:33.320
Is this gonna be good enough
for you today, what you want to wear?

14:33.400 --> 14:34.640
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.080
That sports coat? That shirt? Belt? Okay.

14:42.600 --> 14:43.440
Take a left.

14:50.840 --> 14:52.560
It's gruesome twosome.

14:53.720 --> 14:54.560
- Sorry.
-

14:56.080 --> 14:58.600
Judge, Ms. Zamperini wants to be heard.

14:58.720 --> 15:00.080
And she is a victim, Judge,

15:00.160 --> 15:03.240
because I believe Mr. Peterson
was convicted of first-degree murder.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.360
Her sister was murdered
according to a jury.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.160
Ms. Zamperini would like to be heard

15:07.240 --> 15:09.680
if the court is inclined
to give her a few minutes.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.480
- All right.
- Thank you.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.080
Yes, sir.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.320
Good morning.

15:15.400 --> 15:20.040
Um, Judge Orlando, I think you're aware
that I am Kathleen's sister.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.640
In this court, that is very rarely heard.

15:23.720 --> 15:27.040
Kathleen is a victim of murder.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.160
We have rights in this state.

15:29.240 --> 15:31.720
That is why there's a judge
in this courtroom

15:31.800 --> 15:34.040
to make sure victims' rights are heard.

15:34.120 --> 15:37.600
That is, in my opinion,
the judge's sole responsibility

15:37.760 --> 15:40.800
to make sure that there is clear, fair,

15:40.880 --> 15:45.520
quality representation for the victim,
dead or alive.

15:45.720 --> 15:50.040
My sister has lied in her grave
for ten years.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.800
This Friday, ten years, she was murdered.

15:53.880 --> 15:56.360
Ten years, I have been without my sister.

15:56.440 --> 15:59.160
Ten years, her daughter hasn't had her.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.120
Ten years the rest of us have been alive
and had our freedom.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.120
But not Kathleen. Not Kathleen.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.760
She wanted to live, and she deserves

16:07.240 --> 16:10.560
and should get
the best, best legal representation.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.440
And there is no way I feel, sir,

16:13.520 --> 16:17.400
that you can have this district attorney
represent my sister's rights

16:17.720 --> 16:21.080
and feel you are doing the best job
by the citizens of this state

16:21.520 --> 16:24.840
in having her represent and not
the Attorney General's Office step in.

16:24.920 --> 16:27.520
She is not prepared.
It is clear she is not prepared.

16:27.600 --> 16:29.120
The office is not prepared.

16:30.400 --> 16:31.720
Thank you very much, sir.

16:37.480 --> 16:39.320
All right.
The Court in its discretion

16:39.400 --> 16:42.880
will deny a motion to continue.

16:43.920 --> 16:45.920
The Court is ready to proceed.

16:47.160 --> 16:51.400
Your Honor,
the key issue during Mr. Peterson's trial

16:52.360 --> 16:54.280
was what happened in the stairway.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.960
There was only one witness
called by the state

16:58.040 --> 17:02.600
who claimed to be able to say
what happened in the stairway.

17:04.280 --> 17:07.000
And that was SBI agent Duane Deaver.

17:07.920 --> 17:11.839
He testified that the bloodstain patterns
in the stairway

17:12.520 --> 17:14.440
proved that there had been a beating.

17:14.960 --> 17:18.960
He testified that the bloodstains
on Michael Peterson's shorts

17:19.040 --> 17:23.599
and in particular, there was a stain
inside the shorts and on his shoes

17:24.200 --> 17:27.240
proved that he inflicted
this alleged beating

17:27.319 --> 17:30.960
because he claimed he could tell
that the wearer of those items

17:31.040 --> 17:34.200
was in close proximity
to Kathleen Peterson

17:34.280 --> 17:35.760
when her head was impacted.

17:36.400 --> 17:40.320
But we don't have to take my word
for whether Deaver was a critical witness.

17:40.920 --> 17:43.800
We can listen
to District Attorney Jim Hardin.

17:45.840 --> 17:47.440
What does Deaver find?

17:47.760 --> 17:51.800
This is the first area that he contends
is the first point of impact.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.520
This is above the 15th step.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.400
It's off the wall,
it's off the riser and it's out in space.

18:00.200 --> 18:03.080
Impact spatter in the crotch area
of these pants

18:03.160 --> 18:05.000
and the back side of this right leg...

18:05.080 --> 18:07.960
Duane Deaver said
the only way that can happen

18:08.040 --> 18:12.920
is if he's standing over her
with his leg above her striking her.

18:13.840 --> 18:16.200
Now, why do we know
there was a second assault?

18:16.680 --> 18:19.760
Because Duane Deaver sees,
and this is absolutely critical,

18:20.200 --> 18:25.000
Duane Deaver sees blood spatter
on top of the clean-up.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.600
There's only one way that can happen,
if there's a second assault.

18:30.440 --> 18:31.520
He assaulted her,

18:33.080 --> 18:34.200
she went down,

18:34.840 --> 18:36.560
he continued to assault her,

18:37.520 --> 18:41.000
and that's when
the premeditation formulated.

18:41.360 --> 18:43.560
And, of course,
the only thing Mr. Peterson

18:43.640 --> 18:45.120
was charged with was first-degree,

18:45.200 --> 18:48.320
so without premeditation,
the state's case failed.

18:49.400 --> 18:52.120
And the state relied
upon Duane Deaver during the trial.

18:52.400 --> 18:54.000
There's no evidence

18:54.360 --> 18:58.320
that anything that was done
to that scene altered the walls--

18:58.400 --> 19:00.000
Nobody was walking on the walls.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.920
There's been no evidence,
no credible evidence

19:03.360 --> 19:06.040
that anybody did anything
to the stairwell.

19:06.400 --> 19:07.640
Well, if you believe that,

19:07.720 --> 19:10.960
then you're just got to believe
that Duane Deaver is just a liar.

19:12.040 --> 19:14.320
He has no reason in the world
to come here and lie.

19:14.640 --> 19:18.960
Agent Deaver and Dr. Radisch,
they are tried and true.

19:19.880 --> 19:22.360
Tried and true, because they work for us.

19:22.720 --> 19:26.080
What we didn't know then
about Duane Deaver,

19:26.160 --> 19:27.480
but we do know now,

19:27.800 --> 19:31.280
is that Duane Deaver
had a pattern and practice

19:31.360 --> 19:34.680
of preparing misleading expert reports,

19:35.160 --> 19:39.520
of doing shoddy
and scientifically invalid work,

19:40.160 --> 19:43.920
of presenting misleading testimony
under oath.

19:45.040 --> 19:48.680
He did it in 2010
at Innocence Commission Hearing,

19:48.760 --> 19:50.200
State v. Greg Taylor.

19:51.480 --> 19:53.320
We never asked for a perfect trial.

19:54.320 --> 19:57.880
We hoped to get a fair trial,
and I know that this court did its best...

19:57.960 --> 20:00.760
-
- ...to give us a fair trial.

20:04.240 --> 20:06.360
Thank you very much.
I think that's my cue.

20:09.200 --> 20:12.240
- It's Candace. She's smoking you out.
- I'm sure that's right.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.960
Called to the basement.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.280
Everybody, move back.

20:29.080 --> 20:31.360
- Back to the line. Back to the line.
- Move back!

20:31.440 --> 20:33.440
Let's move. Let's go, ma'am.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.640
- Oh, it's a bomb threat.
- Are you serious?

20:35.720 --> 20:36.560
It's a bomb threat.

20:36.640 --> 20:37.880
- It's a bomb threat?
- Yeah.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.840
-
- Oh, my God.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.960
It was surprising to see
that 40 percent

20:43.040 --> 20:47.280
of Hardin's closing statement
was about Duane Deaver.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.120
It was about his research,
his testimony, and--

20:50.200 --> 20:51.360
That was shocking.

20:51.640 --> 20:54.040
I don't think they had anything else
that made it first-degree,

20:54.120 --> 20:56.560
- and that was all Deaver.
- That was it. Exactly.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.480
Ugh.

20:59.200 --> 21:01.560
- Made me feel sick to my stomach.
- I know.

21:01.640 --> 21:03.960
- Ten years a-wasted, nine years a-wasted.
- Yeah.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.520
- Mike, here you go.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.000
Don't drop the plate. You have it?

21:09.080 --> 21:11.120
- All right, I got it. Thank you.
- All right.

21:12.360 --> 21:17.000
My God, I'm wearing this ten-pound boot
on my foot.

21:17.080 --> 21:18.480
I can barely move.

21:18.800 --> 21:24.120
What was so nice was to see everybody
and my children there.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.960
I can't really talk to them.
That's not allowed.

21:27.040 --> 21:30.440
I certainly can't touch them
or interact with them.

21:30.760 --> 21:31.680
So that's very hard,

21:31.760 --> 21:35.080
but it's wonderful to know
that they were there.

22:20.480 --> 22:24.000
- Dad, we're here! We're here! Oh, my God!
- I know!

22:24.080 --> 22:25.360
Dad, we love you!

22:25.440 --> 22:27.640
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God!

22:27.920 --> 22:30.480
I have never been so tired in my life.

22:30.560 --> 22:32.360
- Oh.
- I can relate!

22:32.440 --> 22:34.040
Oh, God.

22:34.440 --> 22:35.920
- Everything's okay?
- Yeah.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.760
- You like LA?
- Yeah, I love LA.

22:37.840 --> 22:41.840
- Okay. And do you love Boulder?
- I don't love it, but it's good.

22:41.920 --> 22:43.760
- Well, you look great.
- Thank you.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.200
You look just--

22:45.600 --> 22:48.520
- Margaret's helping me with fashion tips.
-

22:50.680 --> 22:52.520
So, what do you think of Candace?

22:53.160 --> 22:55.560
- How is that?
- Dad, are you safe?

22:55.640 --> 22:58.080
I'm afraid she's gonna hunt you down!

22:58.160 --> 23:01.280
I told you from the beginning.
Don't hate. Don't get caught up in that.

23:01.360 --> 23:04.400
- And you could see that in her face.
- Yeah.

23:04.480 --> 23:06.920
- And her eyes.
- And her hands.

23:07.840 --> 23:10.400
- Consumed by hatred.
- Yeah.

23:10.800 --> 23:13.160
And yes, you know, I understand it.

23:13.240 --> 23:16.120
You know, she--
But she can't be the only victim.

23:16.200 --> 23:18.680
You see, you guys are victims.
I'm a victim.

23:19.240 --> 23:20.120
Um...

23:20.200 --> 23:22.520
You don't have to be there all day,
every day.

23:22.600 --> 23:24.640
I want to. It's fascinating!

23:24.720 --> 23:27.080
I'm so angry at Deaver!

23:27.160 --> 23:30.520
I just wanna see all the crap
that's talked about him.

23:30.600 --> 23:34.600
I wonder, sometimes I wonder,
"Where was I during some of that trial?"

23:34.680 --> 23:35.640
I know!

23:35.720 --> 23:36.800
I don't remember that stuff

23:36.880 --> 23:39.120
- where he was gross.
- He was so boring!

23:39.200 --> 23:41.320
- He was gross.
- Boring and gross.

23:41.400 --> 23:42.960
Supercilious and know-it-all

23:43.040 --> 23:44.400
- and just awful.
- Yeah.

23:44.480 --> 23:48.320
- Really a screwy character.
- Yikes. I hated him so much.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.520
Oh, God! Lord!

23:52.040 --> 23:53.800
Okay. No more crying.

23:54.640 --> 23:59.000
Whatever!
That's gonna make us cry more.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.880
We'll see you tomorrow!

24:01.720 --> 24:04.440
- I love you, Dad! Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.640
-
- He does look very tired.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.680
- I know.
- Yeah.

24:12.240 --> 24:16.600
The thing that makes me so sad
is that Dad was our--

24:16.800 --> 24:20.480
The only continuity we've had
in our lives for parents, um.

24:22.920 --> 24:26.480
And so I feel like that's why
we have such a strong bond with him,

24:26.560 --> 24:27.880
um, and with each other.

24:28.280 --> 24:31.320
Uh, but also Mom, Kathleen.

24:31.920 --> 24:37.280
It's-- She really was the first person
who took us in and combed our hair.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.360
You know, we don't know
really what happened,

24:41.080 --> 24:44.560
and so we have to live
with the mystery of her death,

24:45.360 --> 24:49.040
and trust that our dad didn't kill her
at the same time.

24:49.120 --> 24:51.320
So it's kind of a hard position to be in.

24:53.120 --> 24:53.960
I think--

24:54.040 --> 24:58.040
Or it's a position that would,
you know, bring up a lot of stuff, so.

24:58.560 --> 25:01.600
Um, so I've never doubted
my dad's innocence,

25:02.240 --> 25:07.480
but it's just-- just kind of,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.160
I don't know, a hard place to be.

25:11.400 --> 25:12.280
Um...

25:20.920 --> 25:23.440
I started to have doubts.
I mean, how can you not

25:23.520 --> 25:26.880
when you're hearing all these rumors
going around and things like that?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.480
It was the physical evidence
that allowed me to go back

25:29.560 --> 25:31.680
and look at the situation as a whole.

25:32.080 --> 25:34.200
Because, you know,
reading the autopsy report,

25:34.280 --> 25:39.560
was the point at which I was convinced
that my mother had been murdered.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.960
Obviously,
the horrific intensity of the wounds

25:44.480 --> 25:47.640
and the fact that I just, to me,
could not physically come up with the way

25:47.720 --> 25:51.640
that you could get seven deep lacerations
on the back of your head

25:52.520 --> 25:53.800
by falling down the stairs.

25:54.160 --> 25:57.760
I think that there's so many elements
to Michael Peterson

25:57.840 --> 25:59.880
that I can't possibly understand.

26:00.120 --> 26:04.160
I think that from what I've learned
in the last couple of years,

26:04.240 --> 26:08.560
he clearly did not hold himself out
to myself and my family

26:08.640 --> 26:11.760
as the same person that I had
grown up thinking that he was.

26:12.120 --> 26:15.160
I think that there is
a very deep level of misunderstanding

26:15.240 --> 26:16.920
on my part of his character

26:17.000 --> 26:20.720
or possibly an element
of multiple characters,

26:20.800 --> 26:22.240
multiple personalities

26:23.040 --> 26:26.800
to the extent that I can't necessarily say

26:27.080 --> 26:29.680
that I will ever know
what exactly happened.

26:31.720 --> 26:34.520
You know, weeks later,
we find out that he's bisexual.

26:34.920 --> 26:38.520
That, to me, is something
that he did not hold himself out to be...

26:39.880 --> 26:42.560
unfaithful on any level to my mother.

26:42.640 --> 26:47.240
And to think that he had this secret life
going on is just-- it's baffling.

26:47.320 --> 26:51.200
It makes me think there are many things
that I didn't know about him and it's...

26:51.400 --> 26:53.560
it cancels out all trust I had in him.

26:54.440 --> 26:56.560
And that's very scary.

26:58.160 --> 27:00.520
I did consider Martha and Margaret
my sisters.

27:00.600 --> 27:03.800
And, you know, my mother
considered them her daughters.

27:03.880 --> 27:08.720
But my goal, my strength in life,
is completely opposite.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.840
It's in seeking justice for my mother.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.360
That's what I'm here for.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.720
-
-

27:48.840 --> 27:50.600
Right through that door
is your place.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.360
So, what do you have?

27:58.440 --> 28:04.360
You have two women murdered on
or pushed down, whatever, two staircases

28:04.960 --> 28:08.360
in two different countries,
and one man present with them each time.

28:08.440 --> 28:09.720
Both ruled a homicide.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.320
The second thing
is the blood wiping on the walls.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.480
The medical examiner testified,
that I read last night,

28:16.560 --> 28:21.240
that Kathleen Peterson laid there
and was bleeding for a time cert--

28:21.320 --> 28:25.880
She couldn't say how long,
for a period of time before she died.

28:25.960 --> 28:29.760
But it's clear evidence that somebody
was wiping the blood off the walls.

28:29.840 --> 28:34.400
And then, how do you get past
the blood spatter on his shoes?

28:34.960 --> 28:39.160
And then, the bloody footprint
on the back of her leg.

28:39.240 --> 28:42.800
And, Judge, I went back and looked
at the photographs in this case.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.040
I don't know how high that ceiling is
in that home,

28:46.120 --> 28:49.240
but anybody with common sense would know

28:49.320 --> 28:52.400
that the blood on that ceiling
and on the wall

28:52.480 --> 28:54.680
did not come from falling down the steps.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.000
I grew up in a house that had steps.
I've fallen down steps.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.880
My mother has fallen down the steps.

29:00.000 --> 29:04.160
Separate and apart
from anything Mr. Deaver did,

29:04.720 --> 29:09.120
Mr. Labor and Mr. Epstein
indicate in their report

29:09.200 --> 29:11.640
that this was clearly not a fall
down the steps.

29:11.720 --> 29:14.280
And furthermore, Judge Hudson,
they indicated

29:14.360 --> 29:18.000
from wearing the pants of Michael Peterson

29:18.080 --> 29:22.800
that the spatter inside of those pants
came in an upward direction,

29:22.880 --> 29:25.240
and found that, in their opinion,

29:25.320 --> 29:27.640
- Peterson was standing over the body...
- Not true.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.480
- ...of this lady when that spatter was...
- That's just not true.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.640
...inside his pants.

29:32.720 --> 29:36.280
Your Honor, defendant will call
Mike Klinkosum to the stand.

29:41.760 --> 29:44.360
In 1991,

29:44.880 --> 29:49.880
Greg, um,
and his acquaintance, Johnny Beck,

29:50.360 --> 29:56.320
had been out in Raleigh that evening
and had been seeking drugs and drinking.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.880
They had gotten together
because Johnny knew where to get drugs

29:59.960 --> 30:04.800
and Greg had the money,
and so they were doing drugs together.

30:04.880 --> 30:09.520
And they ended up driving down
into a cul-de-sac on Blunt Street

30:09.600 --> 30:10.440
here in Raleigh.

30:11.000 --> 30:14.520
And they sat there for a while
and smoked some more crack.

30:14.920 --> 30:17.200
At one point,
when they were getting ready to leave,

30:17.280 --> 30:21.440
Greg decided, because he had
a four-wheel-drive vehicle,

30:21.520 --> 30:24.360
that he would go down this dirt path
out into this field.

30:24.520 --> 30:29.080
And when he did, he got his car stuck
in a ravine out in the field.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.640
So, as they walked back
into the cul-de-sac and out Blunt Street,

30:33.000 --> 30:35.720
they noticed--
and this was in the early morning hours.

30:35.920 --> 30:40.000
They noticed, um, what Greg at first
thought was a rolled-up carpet

30:40.640 --> 30:43.000
lying in the road in the cul-de-sac,

30:43.640 --> 30:46.560
and it was really Johnny
who determined that it was a body.

30:47.360 --> 30:51.960
And because they had been out using drugs
and Greg still had some marijuana on him

30:52.040 --> 30:56.480
and didn't have a driver's license,
they just decided to leave it be.

30:56.560 --> 30:59.480
And later that morning,
he went back to the cul-de-sac.

30:59.560 --> 31:03.480
He walked up to the police and told them
that that was his truck in the field.

31:03.560 --> 31:06.680
And they asked him to come down
to be questioned

31:07.440 --> 31:08.840
and he agreed to do that,

31:08.920 --> 31:13.040
and at that point,
things started rolling against him.

31:18.400 --> 31:23.040
They had found stains
on the fender and the fender liner

31:23.120 --> 31:26.080
that law enforcement thought
might be blood.

31:26.160 --> 31:32.080
So they sent these stains to the SBI lab
for testing in the serology section.

31:32.800 --> 31:37.520
The report that was generated and signed
by Agent Deaver from the SBI lab

31:37.840 --> 31:41.720
said that there were chemical indications
for the presence of blood.

31:41.800 --> 31:43.640
That's what was written in the lab report.

31:43.760 --> 31:47.400
But what was not turned over or disclosed
was the fact that Agent Deaver

31:47.480 --> 31:50.920
had gotten a negative result
on the Takayama test,

31:51.000 --> 31:57.320
which indicated that he could not confirm
that those two stains were in fact blood.

31:57.520 --> 32:02.520
And the lab report
that was given to defense counsel,

32:02.600 --> 32:06.240
given to the prosecutor,
and introduced into evidence,

32:06.840 --> 32:08.240
Duane Deaver's lab report,

32:09.720 --> 32:14.840
did it say anything about the fact
that an additional test had been done?

32:14.920 --> 32:15.760
No.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.080
What was the result?

32:17.160 --> 32:20.120
Um, Mr. Taylor was convicted
of first-degree murder.

32:20.200 --> 32:23.800
- And what was his sentence?
- Uh, he was-- life in prison.

32:24.360 --> 32:27.680
Did you see in the report
where Agent Deaver stated,

32:27.760 --> 32:30.400
in his opinion,
"there is nothing scientifically wrong

32:30.480 --> 32:34.840
with what they reported,
and they did not hurt anybody

32:35.280 --> 32:38.640
by not reporting negative results."
Did you see that?

32:39.440 --> 32:41.880
Uh, Greg Taylor is the prime example.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.000
He spent 17 years in prison
for a murder he didn't commit.

32:46.080 --> 32:48.600
And if the results
of the confirmatory test,

32:48.680 --> 32:51.000
the Takayama test, had been turned over,

32:51.080 --> 32:53.880
I think that would have made
a large impact on the jury,

32:53.960 --> 32:59.600
because at his trial, the prosecutor,
um, in his closing argument

33:00.120 --> 33:02.680
several times referred
to the blood on the truck.

33:03.120 --> 33:05.960
I think even later some jurors
gave their opinion

33:06.040 --> 33:10.960
that the blood on the truck
was a major factor, um, in their decision.

33:11.960 --> 33:13.920
It never occurred to anybody.

33:14.160 --> 33:17.480
We thought they hadn't done
all the testing they should have done.

33:17.960 --> 33:21.080
Uh, we thought the testing
was probably not accurate,

33:21.480 --> 33:25.520
but it never occurred to anybody
that they had done the testing

33:25.600 --> 33:28.560
and just hidden the results.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.080
Um...

33:30.160 --> 33:35.160
They're scientists, and scientists
are supposed to be about the facts.

33:35.240 --> 33:36.840
They're not supposed to take sides.

33:36.920 --> 33:41.240
They're supposed to reveal
everything they find and not have bias.

33:41.680 --> 33:45.520
Uh, but the fact that they held back
these confirmatory tests

33:45.600 --> 33:50.440
was absolutely biased, uh,
in favor of the prosecution

33:50.520 --> 33:54.080
in the way they conducted--
they prepared that final report.

33:55.160 --> 33:59.800
Uh, so I was shocked, really.
Uh, we were all shocked.

33:59.880 --> 34:02.200
How could a lab do that?
You don't expect--

34:02.280 --> 34:06.800
You'd expect it from a prosecutor
or a policeman or an attorney,

34:06.880 --> 34:09.520
maybe a judge or whatever, but from a lab?

34:09.880 --> 34:10.719
You know?

34:12.880 --> 34:14.800
You know, where's the...

34:16.120 --> 34:17.639
sense of fairness?

34:18.320 --> 34:22.719
Why do they feel like
they have to do something like that?

34:23.840 --> 34:29.360
Um, you know, and I think about
all the years that I lost

34:29.440 --> 34:33.280
because of this,
what I missed of my daughter growing up.

34:33.360 --> 34:37.199
I missed her tenth birthday.
I missed her high school graduation.

34:38.159 --> 34:40.120
I missed her college graduation.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.440
I missed her getting married.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.920
I missed the birth of my grandson.

34:47.920 --> 34:50.719
She was 26 years old when I was released.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.199
And I missed all that.
I look at her today like she's a stranger,

34:55.880 --> 34:58.640
'cause I don't know
how she came to be about herself.

35:23.520 --> 35:28.480
-
- Uh-huh.

35:38.720 --> 35:39.560
Say hi?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.320
- How are you doing?
- Say hi. Hi, Grandpa!

35:44.680 --> 35:47.320
Hi. How you doing?

35:51.680 --> 35:53.200
His first visit to jail.

35:53.920 --> 35:56.160
But he's been to prison
twice already!

35:56.240 --> 35:58.800
-
- He's seen you twice at Nash.

35:58.880 --> 36:01.600
- In prison! That's right. Right.
- Right.

36:02.040 --> 36:03.600
His first time to jail, though.

36:03.680 --> 36:06.760
It's the first
through-the-glass conversation!

36:06.840 --> 36:09.560
All those little memories
that you write down in the baby scrapbook.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.800
- In his baby book!
-

36:12.800 --> 36:14.600
Oh, for God's sake.

36:14.680 --> 36:18.440
- Oh, it's good to see you. God.
- You too, Dad.

36:19.520 --> 36:20.480
Oh, Christ.

36:20.560 --> 36:22.840
I hear your career's going beautifully.

36:22.920 --> 36:27.480
Yeah, everything's great.
Work's going well. All this is good.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.640
He's a darling.

36:29.720 --> 36:33.000
You know, down here with family.
It's stressful, but, you know,

36:33.080 --> 36:35.080
- it's nice to see everybody.
- Oh, yeah!

36:35.200 --> 36:37.520
So, do you know think
he looks like anyone yet?

36:37.720 --> 36:40.120
- No!
- His ears are like mine.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.480
- They are! So you...
- I said--

36:43.800 --> 36:46.400
I said that to Margaret the other day.

36:46.480 --> 36:48.600
'Cause we were looking at you in court
from the back,

36:48.680 --> 36:51.360
and I look at him from the back.
Your ears look the same.

36:51.440 --> 36:53.680
I had gorgeous, small ears
when I was young.

36:54.400 --> 36:57.280
- Is he going to have hair or not?
- One of these days...

36:57.360 --> 37:00.800
- Someday! Someday!
-

37:01.080 --> 37:03.040
When you see Margaret,

37:03.560 --> 37:05.840
would you please wish her
a happy birthday?

37:05.920 --> 37:07.800
- Yeah.
- That poor child.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.000
- I know.
-

37:10.080 --> 37:13.280
You know, I wrote about this day with her.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.240
I was there when she was born.

37:16.320 --> 37:21.840
Well, I wasn't in the room,
but I took her to the hospital in 1981,

37:22.040 --> 37:24.080
drove her through a snowstorm

37:24.200 --> 37:27.520
to go to, you know, Wiesbaden Hospital.

37:28.280 --> 37:33.040
And then I was there every birthday
after that.

37:33.120 --> 37:36.120
Every single birthday she ever had,
I was there

37:36.200 --> 37:38.560
until, I guess it was about
the 18th birthday.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.640
- Then she went to college.
- Yeah.

37:41.720 --> 37:46.520
- And then there was the 20th birthday.
- Yeah, that one kind of sucked.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.800
- Kind of sucked?
-

37:48.880 --> 37:49.720
Yeah.

37:50.320 --> 37:54.360
Yeah, you remember that?
Watching the grid search of the house.

37:54.440 --> 37:57.880
- And then here it is, her 30th birthday.
- 30th birthday.

37:58.560 --> 37:59.920
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

38:00.000 --> 38:03.440
So maybe this is the last
I'm going to see of Dorian until...

38:04.320 --> 38:08.120
you bring him down
for our ice cream and tattoo outing.

38:08.200 --> 38:10.600
Well, we'll see.

38:10.680 --> 38:12.720
So I'll see you Tuesday morning.

38:12.800 --> 38:14.000
- Yeah. No, no.
- Yes.

38:14.080 --> 38:16.360
You're going to watch me
hobble down the stairs, okay?

38:16.440 --> 38:20.920
- Yeah.
- Oh, God Almighty. Oh, Christ.

38:21.000 --> 38:23.120
Don't let them film me
going down the stairs.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.800
-
- Jesus.

38:25.360 --> 38:29.480
- No filming going down the stairs!
-

38:29.840 --> 38:31.600
- I love you.
- Love you.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.800
We love you, Pa!

38:34.000 --> 38:37.280
- Bye-bye. Come on, wave.
-

38:37.520 --> 38:39.160
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.040
- Bye-bye.
- Bye, Dad. Love you.

38:41.120 --> 38:43.680
- Oh, shit.
-

38:44.200 --> 38:46.800
-
- Bye-bye.

38:48.960 --> 38:50.280
Bye-bye.

38:51.480 --> 38:52.560
Bye-bye.

38:56.320 --> 39:00.880

39:24.360 --> 39:27.880
It was snowing, gently falling everywhere,

39:27.960 --> 39:31.600
and after many,
many hours of intensive labor,

39:31.680 --> 39:33.520
I was at your birth mother's side.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.880
Margaret, at long last, emerged.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.360
- She was exquisitely beautiful...
-

39:39.720 --> 39:41.960
...and she looked exactly the same.

39:42.400 --> 39:46.920
Lovely red strawberry-blonde hair.
To Margaret, much love.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.080
May the future bring you much happiness
and continued fulfillment.

39:50.160 --> 39:51.760
- We love you, Margaret.
- Thank you.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.400
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

39:55.880 --> 39:57.320
I love you, guys.

39:57.400 --> 39:59.600
Thanks for coming, guys.

39:59.680 --> 40:01.680
I hope your 30s
are freaking awesome.

40:03.280 --> 40:05.640
Yay! I love you!

40:05.760 --> 40:09.520
My 20th birthday sucked so hardcore

40:09.600 --> 40:11.720
and my 30th birthday is so much better,

40:11.800 --> 40:13.640
so thank you guys for coming.

40:14.120 --> 40:17.160
It's gonna just be a lot better
from now on.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.080
I hope.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.800
- For our loving, dear Margaret.
- Yeah!

40:21.280 --> 40:23.920
Okay, so to all of you guys
and to Dad, too.

40:24.320 --> 40:25.840
- Yes.
- Yeah.

40:34.120 --> 40:36.560
Place your left hand on the Bible,
raise your right.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.960
You solemnly swear the testimony
you're about to give

40:39.040 --> 40:42.640
and the jury, in the case now being heard,
to be the truth and nothing but the truth

40:42.720 --> 40:44.040
- so help you God?
- I do.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.240
Please be seated.

40:45.320 --> 40:50.280
Did there come a time
when you were asked to conduct a review

40:50.360 --> 40:52.640
of the SBI laboratory?

40:54.080 --> 40:58.600
Yes, in, uh... early March of 2010,

40:58.680 --> 41:03.080
we agreed to conduct a review
of all serology files

41:03.160 --> 41:08.520
with similar reporting sequences
as had appeared in the Taylor case.

41:08.880 --> 41:13.640
The purpose of the report was to see
if there had been any cases of injustice.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.640
Did you find that there were
at least a number of agents,

41:17.720 --> 41:22.280
not just Agent Deaver,
who were producing lab reports

41:22.360 --> 41:26.200
that didn't have all of the tests
that they had actually run?

41:26.280 --> 41:31.280
We identified 230 cases
where not all the tests were reported

41:31.360 --> 41:34.120
in the final report
that was issued by the lab.

41:34.200 --> 41:39.040
You would see a presumptive positive,
a negative Takayama in the notes,

41:39.120 --> 41:42.400
and you'd see a final report that simply
reported the presumptive positive.

41:42.480 --> 41:46.600
And, of the five cases
that were categorized by you all

41:46.680 --> 41:50.200
as the most serious of all the cases
you looked at,

41:50.280 --> 41:53.600
who was the agent on each of those cases?

41:54.160 --> 41:55.560
Special Agent Deaver.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.960
Were those the only instances
where you found

41:58.040 --> 42:03.440
that Agent Deaver had failed
to put down what his lab notes reflected?

42:04.160 --> 42:07.400
No.
I believe the final total was 34.

42:07.480 --> 42:09.320
- Thirty-four cases?
- That's correct.

42:10.480 --> 42:11.400
Thank you very much.

42:11.480 --> 42:14.640
Please answer whatever questions
the DA may have. I appreciate it.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.200
Hey, Tim.

42:23.400 --> 42:25.040
These guys work late, too, huh?

42:25.440 --> 42:26.800
We all work late.

42:27.240 --> 42:30.160
What I knew
at the time of the trial was that

42:30.240 --> 42:34.440
what Deaver was saying
was not valid science.

42:34.840 --> 42:39.880
He's trying to put it out in space,
you know, and you just can't...

42:40.000 --> 42:43.160
- It's an area, it's not a point.
- That's absolutely right.

42:43.240 --> 42:46.200
- He worked from the end result backwards.
- Right.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.080
- He wanted to recreate something.
- He looked at the pictures.

42:49.160 --> 42:56.160
So his goal was, "I need this end product,
what do I have to do to get there?"

42:56.240 --> 42:58.720
That's dead polar opposite
to good science.

42:58.800 --> 43:02.440
Good science says,
"We don't care what the end product is."

43:02.520 --> 43:05.960
It was clear to me that Deaver
was not playing by the rules.

43:06.040 --> 43:08.040
My experts were playing by the rules,

43:08.680 --> 43:13.520
but Deaver would simply deny
what was in all of the treatises,

43:13.920 --> 43:17.120
and so there was no way really
to impeach him at that point

43:17.600 --> 43:20.200
uh, and the jury was asked
to believe what he said,

43:20.280 --> 43:22.480
because after all, he was their expert.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.680
Now of course,

43:25.320 --> 43:29.280
I have a lot more ammunition
that I can present to Judge Hudson,

43:30.120 --> 43:34.920
uh, to hopefully convince him
that what I said back then,

43:35.400 --> 43:39.160
which was that Deaver
should not be permitted to testify,

43:39.560 --> 43:42.400
that he was a self-proclaimed expert,

43:42.680 --> 43:46.440
and that what he was saying
was not scientifically valid,

43:47.000 --> 43:48.520
was in fact the truth.

43:48.800 --> 43:50.720
Have you published any manuals

43:50.800 --> 43:53.280
with regard
to bloodstain pattern analysis?

43:53.560 --> 43:57.640
I have, uh, co-authored three textbooks.

43:58.280 --> 44:02.040
The first, second, and third edition
of Bloodstain Pattern Analysis.

44:02.120 --> 44:04.400
Is that recognized as a learned treatise

44:04.480 --> 44:06.400
in the field
of bloodstain pattern analysis?

44:06.760 --> 44:07.600
It is, yes, sir.

44:08.040 --> 44:13.880
I'm gonna show you at this point
some clips of Agent Deaver's testimony

44:13.960 --> 44:15.520
at Mr. Peterson's trial.

44:17.280 --> 44:21.080
The precision
of the math should not be construed

44:21.680 --> 44:26.480
to mean a similar precision
in the definition of the angle.

44:28.400 --> 44:31.080
- Do you agree with that?
- No, I do not.

44:32.840 --> 44:35.240
Would that statement
have been well-accepted

44:35.320 --> 44:38.680
in the field of bloodstain pattern
analysis back in 2003?

44:39.000 --> 44:40.600
Back then as well as today.

44:43.160 --> 44:45.240
For the analyst to state

44:45.480 --> 44:52.200
that an event occurred at a precise point
in space is almost ludicrous.

44:52.280 --> 44:53.800
- Do you agree with that?
- No.

44:54.000 --> 44:57.560
- Is it in fact ludicrous?
- In my opinion, it is.

44:57.640 --> 45:03.320
Anybody who's ever done it would agree
with the statement that's being made.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.400
I think "ever done it accurately"
needs to be inserted there.

45:08.440 --> 45:11.560
On the night
that I was at this scene,

45:11.680 --> 45:18.360
I gave Detective Holland a minimum
of four blows that occurred to the victim.

45:18.440 --> 45:20.240
The reason for that was...

45:20.320 --> 45:25.040
that I found three points of origin
from impact.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.360
That means that the source of blood,

45:27.440 --> 45:29.960
the back of the head,
was struck three times.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.560
I add one to that,

45:31.640 --> 45:33.640
because there needs to be
at least one blow

45:33.720 --> 45:35.920
that occurs to start bleeding.

45:36.160 --> 45:39.640
Do you have
any question in your mind whatsoever

45:39.720 --> 45:43.120
that Ms. Peterson's head was out in space

45:43.400 --> 45:46.800
when those patterns were created
to cause those three points of origin?

45:47.560 --> 45:50.440
I have no doubt that a source of blood
was out there

45:51.040 --> 45:55.440
and that it was impacted creating those
and that they are not on a surface.

45:56.520 --> 46:03.120
Was it acceptable for a bloodstain pattern
analyst to testify back in 2003

46:03.640 --> 46:06.240
that it was inconsistent with a fall,

46:06.320 --> 46:11.040
simply by calculating what he called to be
"points of impact"?

46:11.120 --> 46:13.880
You can't identify points of impact.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.400
You can only come to an area.

46:16.880 --> 46:19.520
In the smallest area, such as a gunshot,

46:19.600 --> 46:23.960
you're generally talking about something
about the size of a tennis ball.

46:24.040 --> 46:26.200
When you start getting to blunt trauma,

46:26.280 --> 46:32.080
you're talking about an area approximately
of 12 inches in a spherical shape.

46:32.160 --> 46:35.640
And in this case, for example,
some of those "points" that he identified

46:35.720 --> 46:39.120
were as close as two inches to a wall?
Correct?

46:39.200 --> 46:40.040
That's correct.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.480
So you can't just,
based on his points of impact analysis,

46:43.560 --> 46:48.480
rule out the wall as an area of origin?

46:49.040 --> 46:50.000
No.

46:50.080 --> 46:51.600
It is misleading to the jury, correct?

46:51.680 --> 46:53.760
- Objection.
- Overruled.

46:54.320 --> 46:56.040
In my opinion, it would be, yes.

46:56.240 --> 46:58.840
Is this the testimony of someone who,

46:59.520 --> 47:02.520
within the field
of bloodstain pattern analysis,

47:02.600 --> 47:04.200
knows what they're talking about?

47:04.520 --> 47:06.600
- Objection.
- Overruled.

47:07.000 --> 47:08.560
In my opinion, no.

47:41.480 --> 47:44.040
Court is in recess
until 9:30 tomorrow morning.

47:50.200 --> 47:51.200
I thought I was prepared.

47:51.280 --> 47:54.240
I thought that I was going
to be strong enough to go in there

47:54.320 --> 47:55.440
and see these photos

47:55.520 --> 48:01.840
and hear them talk about,
you know, the death of our mother,

48:02.920 --> 48:07.840
and Dad has been in prison
for so long and, um...

48:07.920 --> 48:13.200
I just saw such a vulnerability in him
being up there kind of...

48:13.840 --> 48:15.640
having to see these things again.

48:15.720 --> 48:17.920
Being subjected to being talked about

48:18.000 --> 48:21.000
and not being able to have his voice
directly heard.

48:21.840 --> 48:25.320
Every time he'd come into the courtroom,
he couldn't really talk to us,

48:25.400 --> 48:27.800
and I think it's some direction
that he can't do.

48:27.880 --> 48:30.560
He was in chains the first time,

48:31.600 --> 48:34.280
um...

48:34.360 --> 48:38.840
Whatever it was, him talking to me.
And that being the first time,

48:38.920 --> 48:43.120
just kind of softened everything
that was in there

48:43.200 --> 48:47.040
and just allowed me to cry
and to let my grief show.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.600
He looks-- He's in pain.

49:24.280 --> 49:25.360
Why, Jack?

49:25.440 --> 49:27.400
Let me tell you how great you look.

49:29.400 --> 49:35.760
I have never, ever been
in such pain like this.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.600
I can't move my neck. Okay?

49:40.600 --> 49:43.720
I can't, I can't lift my--
Sorry, can't lift my foot.

49:44.240 --> 49:48.920
I have lower back pain.
I can't move. I can't move!

49:50.760 --> 49:53.240
Have they told you
they've contacted a doctor?

49:53.320 --> 49:57.160
- Are they going to bring one for you?
- Huh! No.

49:57.960 --> 50:00.240
No. I can't goddamn believe it.

50:00.440 --> 50:03.880
- Me, either.
- That for once you look better than I do.

50:07.040 --> 50:07.880
Oh, God!

50:07.960 --> 50:09.960
It's not just once,
it's always been that way.

50:10.040 --> 50:13.040
- No, no, no.
- You're just coming to the realization.

50:13.120 --> 50:14.520
- No.
-

50:15.720 --> 50:18.520
- You doing good?
- Ah! You know, I'm all right.

50:19.120 --> 50:21.720
I'm all right. Especially compared.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.480
- Compared?
-

50:23.920 --> 50:26.480
You'll see.
I'm canceling my appeal tomorrow.

50:28.520 --> 50:29.680
I don't care.

50:29.760 --> 50:32.200
No, but I mean,
I have a high pain threshold.

50:32.280 --> 50:34.280
- Yes, I know.
- I do. And this would...

50:35.040 --> 50:38.560
I mean, I've just been lying there,
laying back...

50:39.160 --> 50:43.720
I try to get up and uh! Jesus.

50:45.160 --> 50:47.440
I was telling Clay about your threshold.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.840
I said, I remember,

50:49.640 --> 50:52.920
it was either late '70 or early '71,
I can't remember which,

50:53.000 --> 50:56.480
when Bill and I took you out
of Bethesda Naval Hospital.

50:56.560 --> 50:59.160
Oh.

51:00.920 --> 51:02.680
Oh, my God, I remember that.

51:03.200 --> 51:05.440
- Oh, shit, we went and saw a movie.
- We did, yeah.

51:05.520 --> 51:08.120
Ken Russell's movie on... Oh, God.

51:08.200 --> 51:11.200
Do you remember the scene
in which she's at the bottom of the cross,

51:11.440 --> 51:15.440
she's the nun,
and she's masturbating with the crucifix?

51:15.520 --> 51:17.600
-
- And I...

51:17.680 --> 51:21.320
And you were there,
sweet, good little Catholic boy!

51:21.560 --> 51:25.040
- "Don't tell Mama!"
- "Don't tell Mother I'm here!"

51:25.600 --> 51:27.320
He needs some meds pretty badly.

51:28.280 --> 51:30.920
And not just an ibuprofen.

51:31.000 --> 51:32.600
Yeah, he's in pretty much pain.

51:46.360 --> 51:50.720
I got this group of French people
who are following me around with a camera.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.920
I know they're here,
but what are you doing?

51:56.080 --> 51:57.800
They want to film inside.
I don't know if...

51:57.880 --> 52:00.280
- If that's all right with you...
- It's okay with me.

52:00.360 --> 52:02.560
Oh, you've come
to share lunch with me!

52:02.640 --> 52:04.600
- No!
- You were going to bring yours.

52:04.680 --> 52:06.720
No, I'm not sharing anything
with you.

52:06.800 --> 52:09.200
Why are you hobbling around
like you're 80 years old?

52:09.280 --> 52:10.480
Jeez, 80?

52:10.960 --> 52:12.000
- Ninety.
- How about 200?

52:12.080 --> 52:15.360
- Ask them what I looked like yesterday.
- Why? What's going on?

52:16.640 --> 52:19.640
Well, I'm hardly
the "Princess and the Pea" here.

52:19.720 --> 52:22.080
- You know "Princess and the Pea"?
- Yes.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.040
I've been in prison for eight years.

52:25.120 --> 52:28.400
We don't have
Sealy Posturepedic mattresses or anything.

52:28.480 --> 52:32.680
- They don't have the foam?
- No, no, no. No, it's pretty terrible.

52:32.760 --> 52:36.520
I'm so used to prison
luxury conditions, you see,

52:36.600 --> 52:41.280
that coming to the jail, sleeping
on cold concrete, maybe that's it.

52:41.440 --> 52:45.480
- Maybe that's it.
- It's sort of like going from the Westin

52:45.560 --> 52:49.680
with their Heavenly Beds to Motel 6.

52:50.080 --> 52:51.400
All right. All right.

52:51.480 --> 52:56.520
So, she is not calling Deaver.
She is not calling any experts.

52:57.840 --> 53:00.160
Uh... She's going to call
a couple of witnesses.

53:00.240 --> 53:02.280
I think she's going to try
to get into evidence

53:02.360 --> 53:05.640
that Deborah Radisch
thought it was a homicide,

53:05.720 --> 53:08.920
but neither of those things
has any bearing on it.

53:09.000 --> 53:11.440
Right. As you say, that's for a retrial.

53:11.520 --> 53:12.560
Right, right.

53:12.640 --> 53:14.840
I don't want to get too far out
ahead of ourselves here,

53:14.920 --> 53:18.640
but if we get a new trial,
then the question becomes,

53:18.720 --> 53:24.040
can they even retry you, given the fact
that Deaver was all over that scene?

53:24.400 --> 53:26.120
I mean, all over the scene.

53:26.200 --> 53:28.920
- And, remember the photo glitches?
- Oh, yeah.

53:29.000 --> 53:34.920
- You know, and him smelling the wine and--
- Yes, he's the one that did that!

53:35.000 --> 53:37.480
- All of it. He did all of it!
- Such bullshit.

53:37.560 --> 53:38.600
He did all of it.

53:38.840 --> 53:41.600
Get a good close-up of him.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.080
- I don't think it's a good idea.
-

53:44.160 --> 53:46.240
Oh, another close-up right there.

53:46.320 --> 53:50.160
How the man got away with it,
for as long as he did,

53:50.800 --> 53:53.320
that's really a crime,

53:53.680 --> 53:56.880
because you wonder
how many other cases there are,

53:56.960 --> 54:02.920
not high-profile cases, but other cases
in which the man probably testified.

54:03.480 --> 54:07.000
And he made the difference
of sending them either to prison

54:07.080 --> 54:08.800
or getting them much more time.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.680
And, uh...

54:10.760 --> 54:15.360
I just cannot even imagine
that anybody would do that.

54:15.920 --> 54:20.400
But he's done it for,
oh, gosh, over 20 years.
