10:26.327 --> 10:28.594
in the prison laundry room,
away from cameras and guards.

10:28.596 --> 10:30.262
There were four witnesses.

10:30.264 --> 10:31.797
Conveniently, they all came down
with a case of amnesia.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.666

10:34.668 --> 10:36.668
No, snitches get stitches.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.704
But here's where it gets weird.

10:38.706 --> 10:41.306
In the weeks
before the assault,

10:41.308 --> 10:44.309
Hamasaki was visited over
a dozen times by this guy.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.713
He signed in as Reid Garner,
Hamasaki's attorney.

10:47.715 --> 10:49.314
All right,
what's weird about that?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.450
JERRY:
There's no Reid Garner listed

10:51.452 --> 10:53.485
as a licensed attorney
in the great state of Hawaii.

10:53.487 --> 10:55.954
So I ran him through facial rec,
and as you may have guessed,

10:55.956 --> 10:58.924
his name is not Reid Garner,
and he's not an attorney.

11:00.461 --> 11:02.794
Then who the hell is he?

11:06.934 --> 11:08.634
Gentlemen.

11:08.636 --> 11:10.636
Special Agent Ed Scanlon.
How can I help you?

11:10.638 --> 11:12.404
We need to know about
the case you're working

11:12.406 --> 11:13.305

11:13.307 --> 11:14.406

11:15.542 --> 11:16.908

former associates,

11:16.910 --> 11:19.411
uh, Anthony Palumbo.

11:19.413 --> 11:21.013
James was supposed
to testify against him

11:21.015 --> 11:22.881
in a federal grand jury
last week.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.350
He got cold feet and bailed

11:25.352 --> 11:26.718

sharp instrument

11:26.720 --> 11:28.520
inserted into his ribs
contributed to that decision.

11:28.522 --> 11:30.055
Hamasaki was killed

11:30.057 --> 11:32.024
this morning on his way
from Halawa Prison

11:32.026 --> 11:33.859
to the Marine barracks
at Kaneohe Bay.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.028
That IED attack
on the corrections bus?

11:36.030 --> 11:37.429
We think he was the target.

11:37.430 --> 11:38.829
But it's strange that
Palumbo would take him out

11:38.832 --> 11:40.799
knowing he decided
not to testify.

11:40.801 --> 11:42.067
So who put the hit

11:42.069 --> 11:43.435
on Hamasaki?

11:48.642 --> 11:50.709
(birds chirping)

11:52.046 --> 11:53.412
What was that look?

11:53.414 --> 11:54.680
Was that a look?
Yeah.

11:54.682 --> 11:56.715
Oh, I was just wondering
why the man with...

11:56.717 --> 11:57.983
the man with a
thousand opinions

11:57.985 --> 11:59.751
has suddenly turned
into a Buddhist monk.

11:59.753 --> 12:02.020
You haven't said two words
since we left the command post.

12:02.022 --> 12:03.755
Well, maybe that's because
I don't have anything to say.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.324
Oh, really?
Yeah, really.

12:05.326 --> 12:06.892
Maybe you know
I'm not gonna like

12:06.894 --> 12:08.460
what you have to say.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.062
DANNY: All right, let me
ask you a question.

12:10.064 --> 12:12.497
I understand, okay?

12:12.499 --> 12:14.399
I understand Adam
is shackled to Duclair

12:14.401 --> 12:16.335
and he had no choice,
but what if he did?

12:16.337 --> 12:18.804
What if he was using this
as an opportunity to run?

12:18.806 --> 12:20.806
Why would he turn himself
in and take a plea deal

12:20.808 --> 12:22.040
if he's just gonna run?

12:22.042 --> 12:23.809
Doesn't make any sense.
Okay, tell you why.

12:23.810 --> 12:25.577
Maybe... maybe it has
something to do with the fact

12:25.579 --> 12:26.978
that he had a sit-down
with Gabriel Waincroft,

12:26.980 --> 12:28.380
didn't tell anybody,
not even Kono,

12:28.382 --> 12:30.082
until he was asked about it.
How about that?

12:30.084 --> 12:33.785
He's got 14 months
left on his sentence, okay?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.987
He's not gonna throw that away
for a fugitive play.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.823
Besides, he wouldn't do that to Kono.
Oh, no?

12:37.825 --> 12:39.424
I understand that
once you are a criminal,

12:39.426 --> 12:40.692
you are always
a criminal.

12:40.694 --> 12:42.694
Old life calls, okay?

12:42.696 --> 12:44.696
Need a little help
carrying the weight of the world

12:44.698 --> 12:46.698
on your shoulders
there, Atlas?

12:46.700 --> 12:47.866
I'm just thinking about Adam.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.435
Adam had to run.
He didn't have a choice.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.104
Come on, you know that,
don't you?

12:52.106 --> 12:53.972
I do, and then my mind
starts wandering

12:53.974 --> 12:56.441
into all that stuff with Gabriel
and then I don't.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.110
Well, let me give you
a little advice.

12:58.112 --> 13:00.612
Follow your first instinct.
Your husband's a good guy.

13:00.614 --> 13:03.415
I know that and you know that,
too, more importantly.

13:03.417 --> 13:05.450
He was protecting you
by leaving you out of the loop,

13:05.452 --> 13:07.652
and now he's doing what
he's got to do to stay alive

13:07.654 --> 13:09.454
and protecting himself.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.922
It's just that simple.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.093
JERRY:
<i> So...</i>

13:15.095 --> 13:16.428
I did some digging
into Hamasaki,

13:16.430 --> 13:17.562
and check this out.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.064
You recognize this guy?

13:19.066 --> 13:21.500
Yeah. Solomon Tuasopo.

13:21.502 --> 13:23.635
He's the guard that let Gabriel
into Halawa to visit Adam.

13:23.637 --> 13:25.036
What's he got to do
with Hamasaki?

13:25.038 --> 13:26.071
Nothing.

13:26.073 --> 13:27.672
But he was also the guard

13:27.674 --> 13:29.574
assigned to special holding
this morning.

13:29.576 --> 13:32.077
He put Adam and some other
protective custody inmates

13:32.079 --> 13:34.413
on a bus with prisoners
from maximum security.

13:34.415 --> 13:36.014
According to Halawa

13:36.016 --> 13:38.116
chief of security, that should
never have happened.

13:38.118 --> 13:40.051
Okay. Where are you going
with this, Jer?

13:40.053 --> 13:42.154
I have a theory,
if you don't mind.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.557
Who does this
look like to you?

13:45.559 --> 13:46.691
Our victim Hamasaki.

13:46.693 --> 13:48.760
Right.
But who else does it look like?

13:48.762 --> 13:49.961
I don't know. Who?

13:49.963 --> 13:51.563
I'll give you a hint.

13:52.666 --> 13:54.733
They could pass
as brothers, right?

13:54.735 --> 13:56.868
I guess, yeah.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.570
Which leads me
to my theory.

13:58.572 --> 13:59.838
With all the chaos,

13:59.840 --> 14:01.873
the smoke, the fire,
blood everywhere,

14:01.875 --> 14:04.576
same striped jumpsuits,
same physical appearance...

14:04.578 --> 14:07.145
Hamasaki wasn't the target.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.213
It was Adam.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.589
♪ ♪

14:19.226 --> 14:21.092
Chin, are you sure
they were trying to kill Adam?

14:21.094 --> 14:23.895
CHIN: It's the only theory
that makes any sense right now.

14:23.897 --> 14:25.063
We're bringing Tuasopo in.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.465
He's the guard
that put Adam on the bus.

14:26.467 --> 14:27.899
I want to know who
paid him to do it.

14:27.901 --> 14:28.900
That's easy.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.202
It was Waincroft.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.503
He crawled out
from under his rock

14:31.505 --> 14:33.505
and he's orchestrating
the whole damn thing.

14:33.507 --> 14:34.973
KONO: Yeah, well,
if Gabriel's behind it,

14:34.975 --> 14:37.008
obviously Adam turned down
his offer to partner up.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.109
No way it was Gabriel.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.578
Last time we saw this guy,

14:39.580 --> 14:40.879
he's doing a gainer
out of a window.

14:40.881 --> 14:41.980
He bounced off a car hood.

14:41.982 --> 14:43.048
He's half dead,
he's got no money;

14:43.050 --> 14:44.783
he ain't putting
a hit on anybody.

14:44.785 --> 14:46.518
KONO: Okay. Well,
it's not Gabriel,

14:46.520 --> 14:47.486
who wants Adam dead?

14:47.488 --> 14:48.620
McGarrett!

14:48.622 --> 14:50.155
Chin, I got to call you back.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.795
Look at this.

14:56.797 --> 14:58.163
Look at all this blood.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.232
At least one of these guys
is hurt bad.

15:00.234 --> 15:02.067
DANNY:
Hey.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.002
Guys, I got something over here.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.814
This is the prayer beads

15:15.816 --> 15:17.549
off of Adam's necklace.

15:17.551 --> 15:18.683
It must've broken.

15:18.685 --> 15:20.151
Guys?

15:21.221 --> 15:23.622
Got fresh tracks over here.
They split up.

15:30.697 --> 15:33.565
CHIN: You got a house
on the North Shore.

15:33.567 --> 15:35.567
You got two kids
in private school.

15:35.569 --> 15:37.168
Either you really
know how to stretch

15:37.170 --> 15:39.638
that state correctional buck,

15:39.640 --> 15:41.907
or you're on
somebody's payroll.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.777
You know what I learned

15:45.779 --> 15:47.913
from talking to people like you,
Solomon?

15:47.915 --> 15:50.982
That even the worst men
who have sat in that chair...

15:52.920 --> 15:55.787
...they all have
someone they care about.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.956
Someone they love.

15:57.958 --> 16:01.259
Now, for you...

16:01.261 --> 16:03.295
you got two boys
at the Iolani School, right?

16:03.297 --> 16:05.163
That's 40 grand a
year in tuition.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.633
That's... that's a lot of love.

16:09.970 --> 16:12.003
For me, it's Kono.

16:12.005 --> 16:15.273
I mean, you know, she's like
the sister I never had.

16:15.275 --> 16:17.642
But maybe you didn't know

16:17.643 --> 16:20.010
that the man you had set up
to be killed this morning

16:20.013 --> 16:22.314
is her husband.

16:22.316 --> 16:24.115
That makes him<i> 'ohana.</i>

16:24.117 --> 16:27.285
And that makes this
very, very personal.

16:27.287 --> 16:30.655
So if you ever want
to see your children again

16:30.657 --> 16:32.958
without a piece of
glass and a telephone

16:32.960 --> 16:34.092
between you and them,

16:34.094 --> 16:36.294
you're gonna tell me
who paid you

16:36.296 --> 16:38.196
to put Adam Noshimuri
on that bus.

16:53.213 --> 16:55.914
Where are Garavito
and Aquino?

16:55.916 --> 16:57.983
They should've
caught up to us by now.

16:57.985 --> 16:59.784
Maybe the cops grabbed them.
BURNS: Who cares?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.052
All they did was
slow us down anyway.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.021
All right.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.923
Hold still.
Forget it.

17:04.925 --> 17:06.758
That's not gonna cut
through cold steel.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.194
You got a better idea?

17:11.198 --> 17:12.931
Yeah.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.302
Heat up the chain,
make it softer.

17:17.304 --> 17:19.371
(chuckles)
This is priceless.

17:19.373 --> 17:20.639
The pyro wants

17:20.641 --> 17:22.340
to start a fire.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.342
Does anyone else think that's,
like, a really bad idea?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.377
Look, the man's right.

17:25.379 --> 17:26.978
The cops will see the smoke.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.848
Not if we build the fire
upside down.

17:29.850 --> 17:32.717
Of course. An upside-down fire.

17:32.719 --> 17:34.219
I mean, why didn't
I think of that?

17:34.221 --> 17:35.687
Everybody on your heads.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.056
Be smart.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.157
Shut up.

17:40.994 --> 17:43.128
Gather up the bigger logs.

17:43.130 --> 17:45.196
Start with those.

17:45.198 --> 17:46.931
Smaller logs on top,

17:46.933 --> 17:48.833
kindling on top of that.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.236
This way, the fire burns
down instead of up.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.704
The heat on top

17:52.706 --> 17:54.039
eats up all the gases
from underneath.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.175
Trust me.

18:01.415 --> 18:04.215
Tuasopo's more afraid of
whoever's paying him than he is

18:04.217 --> 18:05.283
of going to jail.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.284
He's not talking.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.886
Well, his money
definitely is.

18:07.888 --> 18:10.121
I found large deposits
into accounts

18:10.123 --> 18:11.723
under his wife's
maiden name.

18:11.725 --> 18:12.791
Only problem is,
there's no connection

18:12.793 --> 18:14.259
to who we thought
was behind this,

18:14.261 --> 18:15.794
Gabriel Waincroft.

18:15.796 --> 18:17.362
The money was wired
from offshore accounts

18:17.364 --> 18:19.397
controlled by
the man he murdered,

18:19.399 --> 18:22.067
late Yakuza boss Goro Shioma.

18:22.069 --> 18:24.069
So whoever filled Shioma's shoes

18:24.071 --> 18:26.337
is the one who ordered
the hit on Adam.

18:28.842 --> 18:30.875
Let's get on with this.
My hand is on fire!

18:30.877 --> 18:32.444
Not yet.

18:32.446 --> 18:35.880
I'd rather keep the chain
than lose the hand!

18:35.882 --> 18:36.881
Okay, over there.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.483
Go!

18:46.393 --> 18:48.059
Yeah! (shouting in pain)

18:48.061 --> 18:50.428
Well, I guess I owe you
an apology.

18:50.430 --> 18:52.430
I just want you
to stay out of my face.

18:52.432 --> 18:53.498
That's all I want.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.775
Where's Aquino?

19:03.777 --> 19:05.243
We got lost.

19:05.245 --> 19:07.445
Cut across a stream

19:07.447 --> 19:09.080
and he slipped on a rock.

19:09.082 --> 19:11.750
Cracked his head wide open.
It was real bad.

19:11.752 --> 19:14.385
Blood everywhere.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.788
He quit breathing.

19:16.790 --> 19:18.790
How'd you get the chain off?

19:24.331 --> 19:26.765
I had no choice.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.139
You sick son of a bitch!

19:34.808 --> 19:36.307
I did what I had to do.

19:36.309 --> 19:37.442
Get back!
ADAM: Easy. Come on.

19:39.212 --> 19:41.546
There's nothing we can
do about it now.

19:44.785 --> 19:48.186
I did what I had to do.

19:50.924 --> 19:52.824
(helicopter blades whirring)

19:52.826 --> 19:55.927
I can walk 18 holes on
a golf course, not blink an eye.

19:58.899 --> 20:00.965
I'm lying.
I take a cart every time.

20:00.967 --> 20:03.301
What I'm trying
to say is

20:03.303 --> 20:04.803
this hiking is
kicking my ass.

20:04.805 --> 20:06.104
(exhales)

20:06.106 --> 20:08.072
Well, I guess
it is better than

20:08.074 --> 20:09.407
walking a beat
in Chicago

20:09.409 --> 20:11.209
on Rush Street in
the middle of winter.

20:11.211 --> 20:13.178
I do not miss that,
I tell you what.

20:13.180 --> 20:15.313
Waking up in double digits
below zero.

20:15.315 --> 20:18.016
Weather forecast for the day is:

20:18.018 --> 20:19.918
popsicle toes.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.920
I can't feel
my face.

20:21.922 --> 20:22.921
(chuckles)

20:22.923 --> 20:24.389
I don't know.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.858
I could do with a little
cold weather right now.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.827
Kono.

20:33.166 --> 20:34.833
KONO:
I see it.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.307
I got blood and drag marks.

20:47.414 --> 20:49.547
Hang on. What is this?

20:51.017 --> 20:52.350
Oh, it's a body.

20:57.457 --> 20:59.023
It's Aquino.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.458
Yeah.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.595
I guess Garavito
prefers his own company.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.163
Hang on.

21:09.469 --> 21:11.536
Where is his hand?

21:19.446 --> 21:21.212
It's over here.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.028
Gentlemen, as much as
I've enjoyed the company,

21:37.030 --> 21:38.330
think I'm gonna
head out on my own.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.631
Splitting up will only increase
our chances of getting caught.

21:39.633 --> 21:41.065
No one's asking your opinion.

21:41.067 --> 21:41.933
The man's right.

21:41.935 --> 21:43.001
We should stay together

21:43.003 --> 21:44.235
until we get to the highway.

21:44.237 --> 21:45.637
The man eats people.

21:45.639 --> 21:47.238
I think that
disqualifies him

21:47.240 --> 21:49.340
as someone we should listen to.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.342
This guy turned himself in
the last time he escaped.

21:51.344 --> 21:54.245
He doesn't care
if he gets caught.

21:54.247 --> 21:55.947
The cops grab him,
he's liable to tell them

21:55.949 --> 21:56.981
which way we're headed.

21:56.983 --> 21:58.349
We can't let him go.

21:58.351 --> 22:00.485
Who's gonna stop me? You?

22:00.487 --> 22:02.420
(gun clicks,
Stockman clears throat)

22:02.422 --> 22:04.088
I am.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.958
Give him the hatchet.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.229
Keep that handy.

22:11.231 --> 22:13.197
I'm gonna need it later
when I kill you.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.166
Shoot him!

22:15.168 --> 22:17.101
Blow his damn brains out!

22:17.103 --> 22:18.469
This guy
is a liability!

22:18.471 --> 22:19.504
All right, shut up!

22:19.506 --> 22:21.072
No one's killing anyone.

22:21.074 --> 22:22.140
Put the gun down.

22:22.142 --> 22:23.608
Everybody,

22:23.610 --> 22:25.243
just take a deep breath.
Give me the gun!

22:25.245 --> 22:27.078
I'll do it!

22:27.080 --> 22:28.112
ADAM: You pull
that trigger,

22:28.114 --> 22:29.514
and you'll tell the cops exactly

22:29.516 --> 22:31.716
where we are,
quicker than Duclair ever could.

22:33.053 --> 22:35.053
Trust me, they're out there,
listening.

22:35.055 --> 22:37.689
They're waiting for us
to give up our location.

22:37.691 --> 22:38.690
That gun

22:38.692 --> 22:40.358
leads them right to us.

22:41.594 --> 22:44.128
Let's go.

22:44.130 --> 22:47.031
Before I change my mind.

22:47.033 --> 22:48.132
Wait, hold on.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.002
How far is that stream?

22:51.004 --> 22:52.637
It's not far-- half a mile. Why?

22:54.274 --> 22:56.975
We're heading to higher ground.

22:56.977 --> 22:58.509
We need to fill these bottles.

22:58.511 --> 23:01.045
We're not gonna get
very far without water.

23:02.282 --> 23:04.148
Okay.

23:04.150 --> 23:05.717
But only Burns goes.

23:05.719 --> 23:08.519
No offense,
but, uh,

23:08.521 --> 23:10.088
I don't know you.

23:10.090 --> 23:12.457
So I trust you even less
than these guys.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.674
If the Yakuza put
a hit out on Adam,

23:29.676 --> 23:31.576
it had to be because he
was working with Gabriel.

23:31.578 --> 23:33.578
Or because Shioma
thought he was.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.779
Well, they'd
have to have

23:34.781 --> 23:37.215
solid intel to come at him
this strong.

23:37.217 --> 23:40.651
No? And it'd be another
reason why Adam's running.

23:40.653 --> 23:42.653
Did you hear what I said?
Yeah, I heard what you said.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.089
I'm not saying you're wrong.
Did I say you're wrong?

23:45.091 --> 23:46.624
No, you didn't, but then what
would be the opposite of that?

23:46.626 --> 23:47.625
The word opposite of--

23:47.627 --> 23:49.761
Why can't you
just say I'm right?

23:49.763 --> 23:50.661
Say, "You're right
about something."

23:50.663 --> 23:52.230
Why can't you say that?

23:52.232 --> 23:53.631
Why?

23:53.633 --> 23:55.533
Am I, am I speaking to myself?

23:55.535 --> 23:57.802
Why can't you say that?

23:57.804 --> 23:59.570
Because you're wrong.

24:01.508 --> 24:03.541
Adam's not running.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.609
He's leaving a trail
for us to find him.

24:15.455 --> 24:17.522
♪ ♪

24:24.431 --> 24:27.098
(branches rustling nearby)

24:29.436 --> 24:32.570
Are you crazy?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.505
I thought you were the cops.

24:34.507 --> 24:36.707
Sorry. They sent me to find you.

24:36.709 --> 24:38.543
Stockman's anxious
to get moving.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.411
He needs to relax.
I'm not done here.

24:40.413 --> 24:41.679
All right,
let me help.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.748
All right, thanks.

24:55.361 --> 24:58.563
(muffled shouting)

25:05.638 --> 25:06.771
(grunting)

25:31.164 --> 25:34.265
What's taking them so long?

25:34.267 --> 25:35.900
Asking that every minute
ain't gonna get them

25:35.902 --> 25:37.368
here any faster.

25:37.370 --> 25:39.203
Oh, I'd shut up
if I were you.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.271
You got a problem with me?

25:40.273 --> 25:42.907
Yeah, I do.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.409
How's a guy
with two bodies on him

25:45.411 --> 25:47.278
get only 18 months
in protective custody, hmm?

25:47.280 --> 25:49.914
DUCLAIR:
Answer him.

25:52.619 --> 25:54.318
ADAM:
The government

25:54.320 --> 25:56.220
had a weak case; I took a plea.

25:56.222 --> 25:59.857
Or maybe you used
some of that Noshimuri money

25:59.859 --> 26:01.726
to get yourself a comfy
little sentence, huh?

26:01.728 --> 26:03.327
(chuckles)

26:03.329 --> 26:05.630
Yeah, you got that
wrong, friend.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.333
Yakuza slit
my brother's throat

26:09.335 --> 26:11.702
three years ago
over a gambling debt.

26:11.704 --> 26:14.305
Let's get
one thing straight.

26:14.307 --> 26:15.573
I ain't your friend.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.177
(grunting)

26:19.179 --> 26:21.245
No.

26:28.855 --> 26:29.587
I'm sorry about your brother.

26:34.194 --> 26:35.560
Where the hell
have you been?!

26:35.562 --> 26:36.661
Looking for Burns.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.329
He wasn't at the stream.

26:38.331 --> 26:40.231
We've wasted enough time.
We got to go.

26:40.233 --> 26:42.266
Yeah, we have to assume
the cops got to him.

26:42.268 --> 26:43.568
All right!

26:43.570 --> 26:44.902
Let's move.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.348
CHIN:
<i> Who is she?</i>

26:57.350 --> 26:58.749
Michelle Shioma,
Goro's oldest daughter.

26:58.751 --> 26:59.817
Married mother of two,

26:59.819 --> 27:03.254
masters in
business admin,

27:03.256 --> 27:05.373
soccer mom,
president of the PTA.

27:05.374 --> 27:07.491
Model citizen, until you get
to these bank transactions.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.598
CHIN: The money used
to pay off Tuasopo

27:13.600 --> 27:15.183
came from her?

27:15.184 --> 27:16.767
Uh-huh. His account's
under her direct control.

27:16.769 --> 27:18.369
I checked with
the head of security

27:18.371 --> 27:20.238
at the branch where
the wire transfers originated.

27:20.240 --> 27:22.373
Michelle was physically present
and signed for them.

27:22.375 --> 27:23.808
And there's security footage
to prove it.

27:23.810 --> 27:26.444
She's out to avenge
her father's death.

27:26.446 --> 27:27.812
So why put Adam
in the crosshairs?

27:27.814 --> 27:29.347
I'm thinking she found out

27:29.349 --> 27:30.648
about Gabriel's meeting
with Adam,

27:30.650 --> 27:32.516
and figured that the two of them
were in business.

27:32.518 --> 27:33.985
So that makes him

27:33.987 --> 27:35.586
an enemy of the family.

27:53.773 --> 27:54.905
Michelle Shioma.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.591
Lieutenant Kelly,
Five-O.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.276
I need you to step out
of the vehicle, please.

27:58.278 --> 28:00.344
Lieutenant, as you can see,

28:00.346 --> 28:03.347
I'm driving my children home
from school.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.715
If you need anything from me,

28:04.717 --> 28:06.317
I suggest you call
my attorney.

28:06.318 --> 28:07.918
Why don't you hold onto that
and call him yourself.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.488
Your girls are gonna
need a ride home.

28:11.724 --> 28:13.524
Step out of the
vehicle, please.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.634
You're not nearly as sharp
as your father, Michelle.

28:25.805 --> 28:27.938
See, your father knew
how to cover his tracks.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.840
He never would've been
careless enough to leave

28:29.842 --> 28:31.542
the paper trail that you did,

28:31.544 --> 28:34.945
leading straight to
Tuasopo's bank account.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.981
And your father
would've known that Tuasopo

28:36.983 --> 28:38.816
was also on Gabriel's payroll.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.818
Did you know he was
the same guard who slipped

28:40.820 --> 28:43.087
Gabriel into Halawa
to meet with Adam Noshimuri?

28:44.724 --> 28:46.791
You didn't know that,
did you?

28:50.963 --> 28:52.863
Tuasopo played you, Michelle.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.033
He saw the chance to make
a few extra bucks,

28:56.035 --> 28:59.337
so he told you about Gabriel's
partnership offer to Adam.

28:59.339 --> 29:02.907
But what he didn't tell you
was that Adam said no.

29:04.877 --> 29:08.346
So all of this was for nothing.

29:10.616 --> 29:11.982
But you didn't know that.

29:11.984 --> 29:14.085
You just knew
that Gabriel was in hiding

29:14.087 --> 29:16.721
and that Adam was in
protective custody,

29:16.723 --> 29:19.357
so you needed to make your play.

29:19.359 --> 29:21.726
And that's where
things got messy.

29:21.728 --> 29:24.562
Well, literally,
because you did

29:24.564 --> 29:26.564
set up the chemical spill.

29:26.566 --> 29:31.001
And you were the one to pay
Tuasopo to put Adam on that bus.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.372
But the IED didn't quite
do its job, did it?

29:34.374 --> 29:35.639
And the hit man?

29:35.641 --> 29:36.774
Well...
(chuckles)

29:36.776 --> 29:39.543
he tagged the wrong guy.

29:41.514 --> 29:45.049
That's a very amusing story,
Lieutenant.

29:45.051 --> 29:47.051
The only part of it
that made any sense to me

29:47.053 --> 29:49.653
is the part
about the kind woman

29:49.655 --> 29:51.956
depositing money
into a dear friend's account

29:51.958 --> 29:54.558
to help pay
for a decent education

29:54.560 --> 29:56.394
for his children.

29:56.396 --> 29:58.896
If that's a crime,

29:58.898 --> 30:02.032
then... I'm guilty.

30:02.034 --> 30:04.702
Is that really the story
you're sticking with?

30:04.704 --> 30:06.437
Lieutenant,

30:06.439 --> 30:10.107
you seem to know
my father very well.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.744
But not the fact that for
the last five years of his life,

30:13.746 --> 30:16.914
he wasn't very active
in the business.

30:16.916 --> 30:23.154
You see, he left the day-to-day
to the person he trusted most.

30:23.156 --> 30:27.625
The one person he knew
would do...

30:27.627 --> 30:31.529
whatever was necessary to
protect our family's interests,

30:31.531 --> 30:36.033
no matter how heavily
it weighs on their conscience.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.637
Is that a threat?

30:46.646 --> 30:48.112
(door buzzes, opens)

30:55.021 --> 30:56.020
(door closes)

30:56.022 --> 30:57.688
(helicopter blades whirring)

30:58.624 --> 31:00.624
All right,
judging by this fire,

31:00.626 --> 31:02.693
they were here
in the last two hours.

31:08.801 --> 31:10.501
If they're no longer shackled,

31:10.503 --> 31:12.503
they're gonna be moving
a hell of a lot quicker.

31:12.505 --> 31:13.504
We got to pick
up the pace.

31:13.506 --> 31:15.639
Aquino's dead.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.808
Yeah, we found his body
about a mile back.

31:17.810 --> 31:20.211
We followed the blood trail;
led us right back here to you.

31:20.213 --> 31:22.646
Garavito smashed his head in
with a rock.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.048
And that ain't all.

31:24.050 --> 31:26.584
He chewed off Aquino's hand
at the wrist to get free.

31:26.586 --> 31:28.586
Okay.

31:28.588 --> 31:30.788
He's not the only one
off his chains.

31:30.790 --> 31:32.089
Well, so much for the advantage.

31:32.091 --> 31:34.158
No, we still got one.

31:35.094 --> 31:37.795
What are those?

31:37.797 --> 31:40.798
Adam's been
leaving us a trail.

31:40.800 --> 31:42.066
Hey.

31:42.068 --> 31:43.534
What I tell you?

31:43.536 --> 31:44.935
STEVE:
Now, let's go find them.

31:44.937 --> 31:46.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

31:46.072 --> 31:47.271
Stop.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.706
I get that this Garavito

31:48.708 --> 31:50.741
is a psychopath,
nut job, maniac

31:50.743 --> 31:52.576
or whatever,
but I don't get it.

31:52.578 --> 31:54.078
He kills the guy
that he's chained to.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.980
And instead of disappearing,
he doubles back

31:55.982 --> 31:58.616
and rejoins the group-- why?
Strength in numbers.

31:58.618 --> 31:59.717
STEVE:
No.

31:59.719 --> 32:01.118
He's not done killing.

32:02.955 --> 32:05.523
(phone ringing)

32:05.525 --> 32:07.925
Chin, hey. How'd you do
with the Shioma woman?

32:07.927 --> 32:08.959
Oh, you'd love her.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.761
She's beautiful,

32:10.762 --> 32:12.562
sophisticated...
and she'd shoot you in the face

32:12.565 --> 32:14.064
just to make sure
the gun worked.

32:14.066 --> 32:15.733
JERRY: While Chin was getting
the silent treatment,

32:15.735 --> 32:17.167
I ran her cell records.

32:17.169 --> 32:19.236
There were dozens
of incoming calls to her phone

32:19.238 --> 32:21.272
before and after
the attack on the bus.

32:21.274 --> 32:22.806
These calls were
pinging cell towers

32:22.808 --> 32:24.241
in the area
of your crime scene.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.243
And we triangulated
on those GPS signals.

32:26.245 --> 32:27.978
There are at least
four active signals

32:27.980 --> 32:30.047
within a mile of
your current location.

32:30.049 --> 32:31.081
CHIN:
Steve,

32:31.083 --> 32:32.116
we believe those are troops

32:32.118 --> 32:33.551
on the ground looking for Adam.

32:33.553 --> 32:35.119
We got company.

32:35.121 --> 32:36.754
We got to move.

32:48.801 --> 32:50.868
Come on, hurry up!
You're holding us up!

32:58.244 --> 32:59.977
STOCKMAN:
Hey! Are you crazy?!

32:59.979 --> 33:01.345
What are you doing?

33:05.585 --> 33:07.651
(grunts)

33:09.322 --> 33:11.789
What'd you do that for?

33:11.791 --> 33:14.058
He murdered Burns and
probably Aquino, too.

33:14.060 --> 33:15.292
What are you talking about?

33:15.294 --> 33:17.194
There was fresh blood
on his pants,

33:17.196 --> 33:18.896
and he stopped bleeding
hours ago.

33:18.898 --> 33:20.164
And where do you think
he got this?

33:20.166 --> 33:21.632
Huh?

33:21.634 --> 33:23.901
You gave it to Burns.

33:23.903 --> 33:25.903
Think about it.

33:25.905 --> 33:27.171
Why would Burns run off?

33:27.173 --> 33:28.906
He had no reason.

33:28.908 --> 33:31.809
Garavito killed him, and he came
back to kill the rest of us.

33:31.811 --> 33:34.612
(leaves rustling)
Where the hell are you going?!

33:34.614 --> 33:35.346
Move, you die.

33:35.348 --> 33:36.614
(groans)

33:47.293 --> 33:49.793
♪ ♪

33:54.900 --> 33:56.000
(panting)

34:00.006 --> 34:01.205
Easy, easy.

34:01.207 --> 34:03.107
I'm not running.

34:03.109 --> 34:04.375
I'm not running.

34:04.377 --> 34:06.010
My name is Adam Noshimuri.

34:06.012 --> 34:07.077
We know who you are.

34:07.079 --> 34:08.879
On your knees,
hands over your head.

34:08.881 --> 34:10.681
I'm unarmed.

34:10.683 --> 34:12.182
I surrender.
Shut up!

34:17.390 --> 34:19.890
(man speaks Japanese over radio)

34:19.892 --> 34:21.692
(speaks Japanese)

34:23.396 --> 34:25.229
You guys aren't
real cops, are you?

34:38.911 --> 34:41.812
Whoever's paying you to do this,
I'll double it.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.380
With what, Mr. Noshimuri?

34:43.382 --> 34:45.783
Everyone knows
you have nothing left.

34:45.785 --> 34:47.951
You think I gave everything
to Shioma, you're wrong.

34:47.953 --> 34:51.221
I think you'd say anything
right now to stay alive.

34:57.029 --> 34:58.095
(man screams in distance)

35:04.136 --> 35:05.302
(screaming)

35:09.875 --> 35:11.308
(choking)

35:22.788 --> 35:25.122
Now we're even.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.177
STEVE: Call Max,
tell him we got another body.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.179
What was that?

35:49.181 --> 35:50.314
What's going on?

35:50.316 --> 35:52.349
It's fine.
Everything's fine.

35:52.351 --> 35:53.984
Don't lie to me.

35:53.986 --> 35:55.385
Whatever happened,

35:55.387 --> 35:57.187
just tell me.

36:01.427 --> 36:04.361
They found Burns's body
by a creek a couple miles back.

36:05.498 --> 36:06.764
Was it Garavito?

36:06.766 --> 36:08.031
He opened the guy's chest up

36:08.033 --> 36:10.234
with a broken bottle
and ate his heart.

36:13.439 --> 36:16.240
He's not gonna stop until
he kills every one of them.

36:36.829 --> 36:38.796
I'm not a real cop.

36:38.798 --> 36:41.331
Doesn't matter.

37:02.354 --> 37:05.155
People who I work for
will never...

37:05.157 --> 37:07.391
Shh.

37:14.233 --> 37:16.967
STEVE:
Hey, Garavito!

37:16.969 --> 37:19.303
Drop the knife!

37:19.305 --> 37:21.004
Put down the knife!

37:21.006 --> 37:22.973
(yelling)

37:34.553 --> 37:36.553
(radio static crackles)

37:36.555 --> 37:39.890
Yeah, I need an immediate
medical evacuation.

37:39.892 --> 37:41.959
Sending location now.

37:43.295 --> 37:44.394
Thank you.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.395
Shut up.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.064
How many more are with you?

37:47.066 --> 37:49.166
(helicopter blades whirring)

37:52.504 --> 37:54.271
(both panting)

37:57.009 --> 37:59.243
Burns said you turned yourself
in last time you escaped.

37:59.245 --> 38:00.244
That's right.

38:00.246 --> 38:02.212
So why'd you run
this time?

38:02.214 --> 38:04.448
Thought the best place
for me was on the inside.

38:04.450 --> 38:05.983
I was wrong.

38:05.985 --> 38:07.551
(two gunshots)

38:23.002 --> 38:24.167
(grunts)

38:51.196 --> 38:52.930
Took you guys long enough.

38:55.434 --> 38:57.200
You all right?

38:57.202 --> 38:59.002
Yeah.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.174
GROVER:
This is Captain Grover.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.709
I need a medevac
for a gunshot wound

39:05.711 --> 39:08.578
on a male escaped convict,
Jason Duclair.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.647
MAN: Copy that.
Medevac on the way.

39:19.458 --> 39:21.525
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

39:29.268 --> 39:31.335
(car doors closing)

39:33.405 --> 39:35.305
(sighs)

39:35.307 --> 39:37.374
Looks like my
ride's here.

39:44.450 --> 39:46.984
No more secrets.

39:46.986 --> 39:49.186
No more secrets.

39:57.229 --> 39:59.496
Hey.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.565
We're gonna make it.

40:03.535 --> 40:05.335
I know.

40:15.047 --> 40:17.581
(whispering):
No matter what happens,

40:17.583 --> 40:20.417
we'll always find our way
back to each other.

40:41.306 --> 40:43.607
(engine starts)

40:47.446 --> 40:49.513
(van driving away)

41:09.635 --> 41:11.635
Hey.

41:15.274 --> 41:17.074
What's up?

41:18.544 --> 41:21.545
Hey, uh, sorry about the
whole, uh, tire thing.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.814
Uh, I dropped off the
jack in your garage.

41:23.816 --> 41:25.549
Don't worry about it.
Okay.

41:25.551 --> 41:28.819
Anyways, the food
fest was amazing.

41:28.821 --> 41:33.390
I made so much tips, and,
uh, Kamekona, he, uh...

41:33.392 --> 41:35.792
yeah, he won best original
dish for, uh, that, uh,

41:35.794 --> 41:38.095
that, uh, three-alarm
chili shrimp dog.

41:38.097 --> 41:40.630
Yeah, that was so good.

41:40.632 --> 41:43.166
So, uh, what... what'd you
want to talk to me about?

41:43.168 --> 41:45.235
Sit down for a sec.

41:55.447 --> 41:57.781
(Steve speaking quietly)

42:12.831 --> 42:14.898
(Steve continues
speaking quietly)

42:25.210 --> 42:28.145
Uh, I don't know
why I'm crying.

42:28.147 --> 42:29.412
(sniffles)

42:29.414 --> 42:32.315
He wasn't really a good person.

42:32.317 --> 42:34.918
Yeah, he was still your father.

42:43.195 --> 42:46.229
I got no more family left.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.298
(sobbing softly)

42:53.272 --> 42:55.539
Yeah, you do, pal.
