00:02.945 --> 00:04.656
I miss you, too,
but what are you doing up?

00:04.657 --> 00:07.708
Isn't it, like, 3:00
in the morning in London?

00:07.710 --> 00:10.177
Yeah, I've been having trouble
sleeping, too.

00:10.179 --> 00:14.998
Alan suggested warm milk
and masturbation,

00:15.000 --> 00:18.519
but that's his answer
for pretty much everything.

00:18.521 --> 00:20.054
No, don't worry.

00:20.056 --> 00:21.972
He's not gonna live here
forever.

00:21.974 --> 00:24.892
More importantly, uh,
when are you coming back?

00:24.894 --> 00:29.012
Ugh! Really, another week?

00:29.014 --> 00:30.614
All right, that settles it.

00:30.616 --> 00:32.983
I'm gonna heat up some milk.

00:32.985 --> 00:35.519
Okay, all right.

00:35.521 --> 00:37.354
Try to get some sleep.

00:37.356 --> 00:38.956
I love you.

00:38.958 --> 00:42.526
No, I love <i>you</i> more.

00:42.528 --> 00:44.662
No, uh-uh, I love you more.

00:49.702 --> 00:51.552
You got a problem with love?

00:51.554 --> 00:53.704
Uh-uh.
No, no.

00:55.390 --> 00:57.007
Sorry.

00:57.009 --> 00:58.542
Oh, it's Jake and his friend.

00:58.544 --> 01:02.045
No, he's not gonna stay here
forever, either.

01:03.849 --> 01:05.816
All right, bye-bye.
Sweet dreams.

01:05.818 --> 01:09.070
Sorry, we'll get out
of your way.

01:09.072 --> 01:10.321
Nah, that's okay.

01:10.323 --> 01:12.073
What are you guys doing?

01:12.075 --> 01:14.075
Well, we were gonna
play a video game

01:14.077 --> 01:16.243
on the big screen,
but if you're busy...

01:16.245 --> 01:17.194
No, no, come on.

01:17.196 --> 01:19.380
Nice.
Awesome.

01:19.382 --> 01:20.414
Where's your dad?

01:20.416 --> 01:22.199
Oh, he's out with
this guy's mom.

01:22.201 --> 01:23.701
Yeah, they're picking
my grandma up

01:23.703 --> 01:25.669
at the International House
of Old People.

01:27.456 --> 01:30.073
I-Hoop.

01:30.075 --> 01:32.075
She's in a rest home?

01:32.077 --> 01:34.244
I guess
they're resting.

01:34.246 --> 01:36.597
They don't move
very much.

01:36.599 --> 01:38.015
Oh, except on pudding day.

01:38.017 --> 01:40.217
Uh, then you could
get trampled.

01:40.219 --> 01:43.437
Wow. Your dad's meeting
his girlfriend's mother.

01:43.439 --> 01:45.106
That's a big step.

01:45.108 --> 01:46.941
What's bigger than
boning each other?

01:46.943 --> 01:47.955
Shut up!

01:47.980 --> 01:49.725
Come on. We both
know they're doing it.

01:49.862 --> 01:51.729
- We've heard them.
- Dude!

01:51.731 --> 01:54.532
Oh, Alan!
Oh, Lyndsey!

01:54.534 --> 01:56.867
Okay, quit it,
or I'm leaving.

01:56.869 --> 01:58.068
Okay, fine.

01:58.070 --> 01:59.236
And I'm taking my game.

01:59.238 --> 02:00.905
I apologize.
Accepted.

02:00.907 --> 02:03.908
It's nice you guys have a sense
of humor about that stuff.

02:03.910 --> 02:06.961
So many kids of divorce are,
like, so angry all the time.

02:06.963 --> 02:08.996
Yeah, well, it's kind of
hard to stay angry

02:08.997 --> 02:10.997
when you smoke
as much pot as we do.

02:11.000 --> 02:13.134
Truth.

02:13.136 --> 02:17.671
When my dad left, I was, like,
really angry.

02:17.673 --> 02:18.806
What did you do?

02:18.808 --> 02:20.057
Just channeled my energy

02:20.059 --> 02:21.592
into learning how
to program computers.

02:21.594 --> 02:24.145
Made my first million
by the time I was 20.

02:24.147 --> 02:26.480
- Oh, that's our plan, too.
- Totally.

02:26.482 --> 02:28.799
Really? What language
do you guys code in?

02:28.801 --> 02:30.651
Java? Perl? C-Plus-Plus?

02:30.653 --> 02:32.820

I am.

02:48.023 --> 02:49.706
Looking forward to
seeing your mother?

02:49.708 --> 02:51.224
Not at all.

02:51.226 --> 02:53.226
I'm high as a kite.

02:54.028 --> 02:55.579
If I'm looking forward
to anything,

02:55.581 --> 02:58.732
it's for that second
muscle relaxer to kick in.

02:58.734 --> 03:01.668
I hear you. Unfortunately,
I can't do that with my mom.

03:01.670 --> 03:03.170
I have to stay alert.

03:03.172 --> 03:06.673
Dinner with her is like being
trapped in a box with a snake.

03:06.675 --> 03:08.842
My mom's more like a hamster.

03:08.844 --> 03:11.044
They seem cuddly,
but they eat their young.

03:11.046 --> 03:12.746
Can't wait to meet her.

03:12.748 --> 03:13.964
Oh, you'll love her.

03:13.966 --> 03:15.915
Everybody loves her.

03:15.917 --> 03:18.268
She's sweet, shy and charming.

03:18.270 --> 03:21.021
Unless you happened
to come out of her uterus,

03:21.023 --> 03:23.190
then you're part
of a balanced breakfast.

03:23.192 --> 03:24.441
That bad, huh?

03:24.443 --> 03:27.311
Yeah, and it's gotten worse
since my dad died.

03:27.313 --> 03:29.112
Oh, she must have loved him
very much.

03:29.114 --> 03:30.564
Nah, hated his guts.

03:30.566 --> 03:32.316
She tried to kill him once.

03:32.318 --> 03:33.400
You're kidding.

03:33.402 --> 03:34.601
Yeah, they were playing golf.

03:34.603 --> 03:35.736
He gave her a swing tip.

03:35.738 --> 03:37.704
She hit him on the head
with a pitching wedge.

03:37.706 --> 03:39.289
A-a pitching wedge?

03:39.291 --> 03:40.774
It was the right club.

03:40.776 --> 03:42.626
They were about 90 yards out.

03:43.795 --> 03:46.046
Anyway, when he finally died
years later,

03:46.048 --> 03:48.298
she decided
he was the love of her life,

03:48.300 --> 03:49.549
moved into
a retirement community,

03:49.551 --> 03:51.885
and put a "gone fishing sign"
on her hoo-ha.

03:51.887 --> 03:56.423
Okay, guess I shouldn't
mention golf during dinner.

03:56.425 --> 03:58.058
Mm.

03:58.060 --> 03:59.593
Or fishing.

03:59.595 --> 04:02.646
Yeah. You might also want
to stay away from politics,

04:02.648 --> 04:04.731
religion or <i>The Price Is Right.</i>

04:04.733 --> 04:05.732

04:05.734 --> 04:06.733
She misses Bob Barker.

04:06.735 --> 04:07.934
Hates Drew Carey.

04:07.936 --> 04:09.302
Oh, really?

04:09.304 --> 04:11.104
I think he's a wonderful breath
of fresh air.

04:11.106 --> 04:12.739

Man, I used to be a lot better
at this.

04:30.759 --> 04:32.759
I guess
I'm just out of practice.

04:32.761 --> 04:34.511
That's 'cause
you got a girlfriend now.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.496
Yeah. Your thumbs
have gotten weak.

04:38.015 --> 04:39.850

04:46.007 --> 04:47.140
Are you gonna marry her?

04:47.142 --> 04:49.509
I don't know.
I mean, I love her and all,

04:49.511 --> 04:51.445
but I just got out
of a marriage.

04:51.447 --> 04:53.613
Do I really want
to be back in one?

04:53.615 --> 04:55.031
Hell, yeah.
She's hot.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.616
It's not about how hot she is.

04:56.618 --> 04:58.702
Oh, thank you, Jake.

04:58.704 --> 05:01.138
It's about whether
she <i>stays</i> hot.

05:05.076 --> 05:07.577
I mean, plus, there's some
serious stuff to consider.

05:07.579 --> 05:10.547
She has a daughter,
so I'd be a stepdad.

05:10.549 --> 05:12.632
My stepdad's a pretty cool guy.

05:12.634 --> 05:14.801
I mean, he's always
slipping me money.

05:14.803 --> 05:17.137
I think he feels bad
about replacing my dad.

05:17.139 --> 05:19.673
Or about banging
your mom.

05:19.675 --> 05:20.891
Shut up!

05:20.893 --> 05:23.510
Mm, doesn't feel
so good, does it?

05:23.512 --> 05:25.762
That's what
your mom said.

05:27.432 --> 05:30.517
All right, can we please talk
about something other than sex?

05:30.519 --> 05:32.936
Yes.
Okay.

05:32.938 --> 05:35.322
But for the record,
I'm not a virgin.

05:35.324 --> 05:37.274
Good to know.

05:37.276 --> 05:39.526

07:59.134 --> 08:01.051
Seriously, Mom? Really?

08:01.053 --> 08:03.503
What? It was a
very nice movie--

08:03.505 --> 08:05.722
if you like pornography.

08:05.724 --> 08:09.542
Okay, I-I saw it, and-and
it wasn't pornography.

our first consultation.

08:51.519 --> 08:52.852
How about this?

08:52.854 --> 08:55.221
We could tell you

09:10.288 --> 09:12.605
tell me some of your app ideas.

09:12.607 --> 09:14.741
Okay, well, you know, uh,

09:14.743 --> 09:18.461
when you take a picture of
your junk and send it to a girl?

09:20.131 --> 09:22.432
Um... no.

09:23.450 --> 09:25.051
But I understand the concept.

09:25.053 --> 09:29.305
Okay, okay, well, this app
makes your junk look bigger.

09:29.307 --> 09:32.075
And you can customize it.

09:33.511 --> 09:35.345
You can customize your junk?

09:35.347 --> 09:37.463
Yeah, you know,
like silly hats,

09:37.465 --> 09:39.465
glasses, little messages.

09:39.467 --> 09:42.452
"Wish you were here."

09:43.320 --> 09:45.405
Get it? Get it?

09:45.407 --> 09:47.157
Yeah, I get it.

09:47.159 --> 09:50.326
So, it's like Photoshop,
but for your junk.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.697
We call it Junkshop.

09:54.532 --> 09:55.949
It's a good name.

09:55.951 --> 09:58.585
What do you do
if you already got big junk?

09:58.587 --> 10:00.870
Oh, way ahead of you.
Tell him about Boobshop.

10:00.872 --> 10:03.673
All right, you know
how girls always complain

10:03.675 --> 10:06.009
about one boob being bigger
than the other?

10:10.965 --> 10:13.633
Oh, thank God,
she's asleep.

10:13.635 --> 10:15.552
I don't think
I can last four days.

10:15.554 --> 10:17.670
Every word out of her mouth
pushes my buttons.

10:17.672 --> 10:19.689
Yeah, I saw.
She's like a ninja mom.

10:19.691 --> 10:21.608
She sneaks in,
destroys your will to live,

10:21.610 --> 10:23.342
and then,
disappears without a trace.

10:23.344 --> 10:24.510
So I'm not crazy?

10:24.512 --> 10:25.729
Oh, no, not at all.
Oh.

10:25.731 --> 10:27.897
In fact, it kind of makes me
grateful for my mom.

10:27.899 --> 10:28.698
What do you mean?

10:28.700 --> 10:30.016
Well, there's no sneaking

10:30.018 --> 10:31.201
and stabbing in the back.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.368
She just walks right up to you,

10:32.370 --> 10:33.903
and hits you in the face
with a lead pipe.

10:35.123 --> 10:36.355
I wonder what would happen

10:36.357 --> 10:38.524
if we put them
in the same room together.

10:38.526 --> 10:39.876
Uh. Momageddon.

10:41.362 --> 10:44.697
Although... it wouldn't be
the worst idea in the world.

10:44.699 --> 10:45.531
What?!

10:45.533 --> 10:46.800
Well, think about it.

10:46.802 --> 10:48.635
They're around the same age,
they're single,

10:48.637 --> 10:51.421
they're both deeply disappointed
in their children

10:51.423 --> 10:54.340
and their children's children.

10:54.342 --> 10:55.675
They might hit it off.

10:55.677 --> 10:59.045
And if they did,
it might give us a break.

10:59.047 --> 11:00.230
You know what? Tell you what--

11:00.232 --> 11:02.682
I will call my mom
and try to set up a dinner.

11:02.684 --> 11:03.850
Oh, Alan,

11:03.852 --> 11:05.551
that would
be wonderful. Mm.

11:05.553 --> 11:07.153
I owe you one.

11:07.155 --> 11:09.739
You still owe me one
from my birthday.

11:09.741 --> 11:11.858
Well...

11:11.860 --> 11:14.077
if she wasn't here,
I'd be steering this car

11:14.079 --> 11:16.395
with the back
of my head right now.

11:19.533 --> 11:21.534
Looks like she's
sleeping pretty good.

11:24.171 --> 11:26.172
Oh, what the hell?
Scoot your seat back.

11:27.007 --> 11:29.759
<i>Yay!</i>

11:36.555 --> 11:38.205
♪ Men.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.274
Hey, what you doing?

11:40.276 --> 11:41.542
Absolutely nothing.

11:41.544 --> 11:42.910
I'm bored out of my mind.

11:42.912 --> 11:44.912
Oh, well, Lyndsey and I
are having dinner with our moms.

11:44.914 --> 11:45.963
You're welcome to join us.

11:45.965 --> 11:47.898
A two-mom dinner?

11:47.900 --> 11:48.883
You can say no.

11:48.885 --> 11:50.584
No. God, no.

11:50.586 --> 11:51.952
I get you.

11:51.954 --> 11:53.337
I don't want to go, either.

11:53.339 --> 11:54.805
Why are you
doing it?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.174
Are you thinking
about getting married?

11:57.176 --> 11:59.560
Um, to answer your questions
in reverse order:

11:59.562 --> 12:01.512
not at the moment and oral sex.

12:01.514 --> 12:02.730
Night.

12:05.400 --> 12:08.769
Oral sex.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.971
Time to warm up the old milk.

12:12.157 --> 12:13.407
Oh, great, Amy.

12:13.409 --> 12:14.992
We'll be there.

12:14.994 --> 12:16.110
What's going on?

12:16.112 --> 12:17.194
Just got invited

12:17.196 --> 12:19.113
to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

12:19.115 --> 12:20.147
Cool.

12:20.149 --> 12:22.149
Can we borrow your car?

12:24.786 --> 12:27.204
Uh, all right, let me think.

12:27.206 --> 12:31.258
Two potheads want to borrow
my $100,000 car

12:31.260 --> 12:33.994
to go to a slammin' party
in the Valley.

12:34.846 --> 12:36.096
Sounds like a no.

12:36.098 --> 12:37.298
Wait, wait, wait.

12:37.300 --> 12:38.632
Let's hear him out.

12:38.634 --> 12:40.801
It's a no!

12:42.137 --> 12:43.938
I'll give you guys a ride.

12:43.940 --> 12:45.556
- Oh, sweet.
- Thanks.

12:45.558 --> 12:47.107
What you got going on
with the water?

12:47.109 --> 12:49.477
Oh, we had another idea
for an app.

12:49.479 --> 12:52.112
Let me guess-- Sinkshop.

12:52.114 --> 12:53.397
Oh, no, no.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.666
Okay, imagine the app
is on my phone.

12:55.668 --> 12:57.034
- All right.
- Go ahead.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.037
Now, all I do

13:00.039 --> 13:02.523
is press this button,
and our app will tell you

13:02.525 --> 13:05.810
exactly how long you can
hold your breath underwater.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.533
That's clever.

13:12.535 --> 13:13.717
Thanks.

13:13.719 --> 13:15.536
How is it different
than the stopwatch

13:15.538 --> 13:16.754
that's already
on your phone?

13:16.756 --> 13:18.205
The what?

13:18.207 --> 13:20.808
See this
little clock?

13:21.927 --> 13:23.727
Oh.

13:23.729 --> 13:26.213
Damn.

13:26.215 --> 13:28.499
How long?

13:32.320 --> 13:33.654
So this is nice, huh?

13:33.656 --> 13:34.738
Lovely.

13:34.740 --> 13:36.223
I can't remember
how long it's been

13:36.225 --> 13:38.225
since the last time
you called me to have dinner.

13:38.227 --> 13:39.860
Oh, come on. It hasn't
been that long.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.729
Oh, please.
Jake was still cute.

13:42.731 --> 13:45.065
Guess it has been awhile.

13:45.067 --> 13:46.417
So what's up with this dinner?

13:46.419 --> 13:48.836
Why are you finally allowing me
to meet your girlfriend?

13:48.838 --> 13:50.337
First of all, I wasn't
disallowing you

13:50.339 --> 13:51.905
from meeting her;
I was just, uh...

13:51.907 --> 13:54.208
avoiding it as long as possible.

13:55.577 --> 13:57.578
Uh, but things
are more serious between us now,

13:57.580 --> 13:58.963
and I thought it might be nice

13:58.965 --> 14:00.881
for you two
to get to know each other.

14:00.883 --> 14:03.417
- All right.
- And her mother might come along.

14:03.419 --> 14:04.468
Her mother?

14:04.470 --> 14:06.053
Yeah, she's, uh,
in town visiting.

14:06.055 --> 14:08.222
I thought you two
might hit it off.

14:08.224 --> 14:12.476
Alan, you know
I don't like old people.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.446
I do know, but you'll like her.

14:15.448 --> 14:17.097
She's young at heart,
like you.

14:17.099 --> 14:20.100
I'm young everywhere--
all the parts.

14:20.102 --> 14:21.268
Sure.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.369
What I haven't replaced,

14:22.371 --> 14:25.039
I've had tightened,
bleached or trimmed.

14:25.041 --> 14:26.957
Got it.

14:26.959 --> 14:28.775
So where's
the old biddy live?

14:28.777 --> 14:30.110
Palmdale.

14:30.112 --> 14:33.130
Palmdale, ech.

14:33.132 --> 14:34.448
Is she married?

14:34.450 --> 14:35.616
Uh, widow.

14:35.618 --> 14:36.634
How'd her husband die?

14:36.636 --> 14:37.801
Heart attack.

14:37.803 --> 14:39.053
Boring.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.806
She did actually try
to kill him once.

14:42.808 --> 14:43.924
Oh.

14:43.926 --> 14:45.709
Well, at least we have
something in common.

14:49.064 --> 14:51.065
Sure you gave me
the right address?

14:51.067 --> 14:52.399
Yeah.

14:52.401 --> 14:54.935
1478 Amy Lane.

14:54.937 --> 14:56.937
Wait a sec.

14:56.939 --> 15:00.574
Isn't Amy Lane the name
of the chick having the party?

15:02.944 --> 15:06.430
It may not be Amy Lane.

15:08.583 --> 15:12.536
But we're on
Amy Lane.

15:12.538 --> 15:15.289
An amazing coincidence, huh?

15:16.508 --> 15:18.626
Is there somebody
you guys can call?

15:18.628 --> 15:20.327
I mean,
I can call Amy Lane.

15:20.329 --> 15:23.631
If that is, in fact,
her real name.

15:28.637 --> 15:31.838
Evelyn, Alan tells me
you do a lot of traveling.

15:31.840 --> 15:33.474
Yes. I love it.

15:33.476 --> 15:36.276
The classical architecture,
the exotic cuisine,

15:36.278 --> 15:37.844
the uncircumcised men.

15:39.649 --> 15:41.565
Although one could make a case

15:41.567 --> 15:43.850
that falls under
"exotic cuisine."

15:43.852 --> 15:48.038
Just like you and
Alan in the car.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.712
Do you guys travel much?

15:54.714 --> 15:56.196
Not anymore.

15:56.198 --> 15:59.333
But when my husband was alive,
we went everywhere.

15:59.335 --> 16:02.970
Six Flags, Epcot, Dollywood.

16:02.972 --> 16:04.371
Charming.

16:04.373 --> 16:06.306
Real globe-trotter.

16:06.308 --> 16:09.376
Speaking of which, I once slept
with Meadowlark Lemon.

16:10.729 --> 16:12.429
Let me tell you,

16:12.431 --> 16:15.566
basketballs weren't
the only thing he could spin.

16:18.069 --> 16:20.220
I'm so sorry.

16:21.406 --> 16:22.690
I hope this is it.

16:22.692 --> 16:24.441
They have a balloon
on the mailbox

16:24.443 --> 16:26.226
that says party.
Mm.

16:29.397 --> 16:31.648
Yeah?

16:32.417 --> 16:34.735
Uh, is this
where the party is?

16:34.737 --> 16:37.571
Oh, you saw the balloon, huh?

16:37.573 --> 16:39.206
Come on in.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.758
Okay.
Oh, hang on.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.459
Hang on. Excuse us.

16:42.461 --> 16:45.012
Don't you pay attention
in health class?

16:45.014 --> 16:46.380
What are you
talking about?

16:46.382 --> 16:48.198
Stranger danger.

16:50.635 --> 16:52.686
No, he seems okay.

16:52.688 --> 16:55.088
You guys like to wrestle?

16:55.090 --> 16:56.890
Let's book it, dude.

16:56.892 --> 16:59.209
Yeah. Walden!
Don't go!

17:01.262 --> 17:03.597
Always a bridesmaid.

17:05.000 --> 17:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here

17:12.040 --> 17:13.574
Really, Alan?

17:16.211 --> 17:17.728
Why don't I get this?

17:19.164 --> 17:21.298
Well, you got to admit
my plan worked.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.751
They hit it off and left us
pretty much unscathed.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.286
Plus, thanks to your mom,
my mom can now go back

17:26.288 --> 17:28.472
to her retirement community
and show all her girlfriends

17:28.473 --> 17:30.808
what happens
when you Google "Santorum."

17:32.928 --> 17:35.979
Lyndsey, will you take me
to get a tramp stamp?

17:35.981 --> 17:37.397
What?

17:37.399 --> 17:40.017
It's a cute little tattoo
right here.

17:40.019 --> 17:41.301
Evelyn has one.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.519
You do?

17:42.521 --> 17:44.071
I got it in Singapore.

17:44.073 --> 17:47.241
The Chinese characters for:
"Thank you. Come again."

17:48.743 --> 17:51.278
All right, well,
we're done here.

17:51.280 --> 17:52.446
Why don't we head home?

17:52.448 --> 17:54.114
I don't want
to go home.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.149
Evelyn says there's a place
right down the street

17:56.151 --> 17:58.252
where they have music
and dancing.

17:58.254 --> 18:00.003
Oh, I don't think so.
It's getting kind of late.

18:00.005 --> 18:01.872
Yeah, we both have
to work in the morning.

18:01.874 --> 18:02.873
I don't.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.324
Neither do I.

18:04.326 --> 18:06.043
Why don't you two fuddy-duddies
run along

18:06.045 --> 18:08.328
and let Jean and I
have some fun?

18:08.330 --> 18:10.047
How will you get home?

18:10.049 --> 18:12.516
Alan, I made it from Brunei
to Morocco with nothing

18:12.518 --> 18:15.335
but the clothes on my back
and a tube of lubricant.

18:15.337 --> 18:18.856
I think I can get us
from Tarzana to Sherman Oaks.

18:18.858 --> 18:21.191
Isn't she a hoot?

18:21.193 --> 18:23.894
All right,
if you're sure.

18:23.896 --> 18:25.362
Let's go.

18:26.447 --> 18:28.866
You think we'll find
some cute fellas to dance with?

18:28.868 --> 18:30.818
Oh, Jean, Jean, Jean.

18:30.820 --> 18:33.070
We're not going
to dance.

18:35.990 --> 18:37.658
♪ Men.

18:37.660 --> 18:39.993
Should have written
the address down, dude.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.078
I did write it down.

18:41.080 --> 18:42.696
She must have told it
to me wrong.

18:42.698 --> 18:44.131
Or maybe you
heard it wrong.

18:44.133 --> 18:48.335
If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

18:49.972 --> 18:53.974
If only there was an app that
could capture the spoken word.

18:55.310 --> 18:56.894
Don't mock us, man.

18:57.763 --> 19:00.731
Don't mock us, man.

19:02.049 --> 19:04.234
Hi, Jake.

19:04.769 --> 19:05.686
Hi, Eldridge.

19:05.688 --> 19:07.321
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:08.222 --> 19:10.073
I bet they were
at the party.

19:10.075 --> 19:12.893
Yeah, maybe they can
tell us where it is.

19:12.895 --> 19:13.861
Oh, good thinking.

19:13.863 --> 19:15.279
I'll text 'em.

19:17.064 --> 19:19.065
Wait, I don't have
their numbers.

19:19.918 --> 19:23.537
Man, we're never going
to find this party.

19:24.339 --> 19:26.840
Okay.

19:28.092 --> 19:30.344
Let me ask you a question.

19:30.346 --> 19:33.847
If you had made it to the party,
what would you have done there?

19:33.849 --> 19:36.416
Try to hook up
with some chicks.

19:45.009 --> 19:47.194
Why don't you hook up with them?

19:48.696 --> 19:51.865
Right there--
that's why you're rich.

19:53.618 --> 19:57.120
Would you mind very much if
we, you know, blew you off?

19:57.122 --> 19:59.239
I would worry about
you if you didn't.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.325
- Bye.
- Later.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.877
Hello, ladies.

20:03.879 --> 20:06.079
Mind if we
hook up with you?

20:10.141 --> 20:12.142
♪ Men.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.393
Morning.
Morning.

20:13.395 --> 20:14.477
Oh, morning.

20:14.479 --> 20:15.845
You and Evelyn have a
good time last night?

20:15.847 --> 20:17.630
Fantastic.
Mm.

20:17.632 --> 20:19.316
I adore your mother.

20:19.318 --> 20:21.651
That's only because
you just met her.

20:21.653 --> 20:24.988
I don't know, I think I got
to know her pretty well.

20:24.990 --> 20:27.557
Good morning,
darling.

20:29.243 --> 20:30.827
Hi, Peaches.

20:36.367 --> 20:39.152
Once again,
I'm so, so sorry.
