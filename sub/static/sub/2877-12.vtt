WEBVTT

00:02.585 --> 00:04.753
- Oh, hey, Joey.
- Mmm.

00:05.213 --> 00:08.090
- Hey.
- Listen, I need to ask you something.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.134
You know how my stepdad's in prison?

00:10.301 --> 00:12.386
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:12.554 --> 00:16.598
He was supposed to get a weekend
furlough so he could go to the wedding.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.934
But he just called and...

00:19.102 --> 00:24.106
Well, apparently stabbing Iceman in the
exercise yard couldn't wait till Monday.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.567
- So he can't come?
- No.

00:26.735 --> 00:29.987
And so there's no one to walk me
down the aisle. And...

00:30.739 --> 00:33.615
Well, I would just really love it
if you would do it.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.326
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

00:36.494 --> 00:39.246
You've, you know,
sort of been like a dad to me.

00:40.790 --> 00:44.460
You've always, you know, looked out
for me and shared your wisdom.

00:47.005 --> 00:49.465
I am pretty "wisdomous."

00:50.717 --> 00:52.968
So, what do you say?

00:53.136 --> 00:56.805
Are you kidding?
Phoebe, I would be honored.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.808
Oh, thank you.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.728
I hope...

01:03.730 --> 01:06.482
I hope you know how much
you mean to me.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.151
Listen, I hope...

01:09.319 --> 01:11.653
I hope that you know...

01:13.782 --> 01:17.493
I don't want you to see your father cry.
Go to your room!

02:08.794 --> 02:11.547
- Oh.
- Oh, no, no, no. Let your dad get this.

02:15.385 --> 02:19.721
Oh. It's my wedding planner.
She's driving me crazy!

02:19.889 --> 02:24.601
Hello? Okay, stop screaming!

02:24.769 --> 02:27.396
Okay, so halibut.

02:27.564 --> 02:30.232
All right, so salmon.
Either way. I don't...

02:30.400 --> 02:33.152
- It doesn't matter to me.
- Well, it matters to me!

02:35.280 --> 02:38.198
Well, I don't care. So you pick.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.492
Did you just hang up on me?

02:41.494 --> 02:45.122
All right, look, I need you at the
rehearsal dinner tonight at 1800 hours.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.457
Okay. What time is that?

02:48.918 --> 02:50.586
You don't know military time?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.964
I must have been in missile training
the day they taught that.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.717
Just subtract 12.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.469
Okay, so 1800 minus 12...

02:59.637 --> 03:02.097
...is 1788.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.307
- Six o'clock!
- Okay.

03:04.684 --> 03:06.226
Hold on. Yeah? Geller here.

03:06.728 --> 03:11.190
No, I said it has to be there
by 4:00. Goodbye.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.692
How hard is it to make an ice sculpture?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.485
That sounds really fancy.

03:15.653 --> 03:18.030
I told you, I just want a simple wedding.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.908
Please, honey, leave the details to me.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.785
Now, I wanna make this day
as special for you as I can.

03:23.953 --> 03:26.163
I was thinking the harpist
should wear white.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.625
Harpist? My friend Marjorie
is playing the steel drums.

03:29.792 --> 03:32.628
- Oh, she backed out.
- She did? Why?

03:32.795 --> 03:34.630
I made her.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.049
Steel drums don't really say
"elegant wedding."

03:37.217 --> 03:40.636
- Nor does Marjorie's overwhelming scent.
- Hey!

03:40.803 --> 03:43.889
She will shower when Tibet is free.

03:52.148 --> 03:56.276
- Hey. You look great.
- You too.

03:56.444 --> 04:01.531
I'm glad we're having a rehearsal dinner.
I rarely practice my meals before I eat.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.660
What did we say
was your one gift to us?

04:04.827 --> 04:08.330
No stupid jokes, but I thought
that was for the actual wedding.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.332
Rehearse it.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.459
Hi.

04:12.627 --> 04:14.836
- Thanks for coming, you guys.
- Oh, yeah...

04:15.046 --> 04:18.507
I was...
I was going for a handshake.

04:18.675 --> 04:20.509
That why your hand's
against my crotch?

04:20.677 --> 04:22.761
- That is why.
- Yeah.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.098
So, Rach, where's Emma?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.975
Monica made me send her
to my mom's.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.019
Apparently, babies and weddings
don't mix.

04:31.187 --> 04:34.356
Are you still crying about
your damn baby?

04:35.275 --> 04:39.027
Pheebs, you got to keep the line moving.
Remember, 20 seconds per person.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.988
You see these clowns all the time.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.703
- Hey, you're Mike's parents, right?
- Yes, we are.

04:47.870 --> 04:50.706
Gosh, our little ones
are growing up fast, aren't they?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.709
- How's that?
- You know...

04:53.876 --> 04:57.379
...on one hand, you're happy for them.
On the other, it's hard to let go.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.966
Who in God's name are you?

05:01.384 --> 05:05.721
I'm not that fond of you either, buddy.
I'm just trying to be nice for the kids.

05:08.099 --> 05:12.686
You know what? We have no idea what
we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.731
I thought we'd be groomsmen.
They would have asked us by now.

05:15.898 --> 05:18.400
When did they ask you
to be a bridesmaid?

05:18.609 --> 05:22.738
- November.
- I wanna say it's not looking good.

05:23.072 --> 05:24.906
- Hey, Pheebs?
- Huh?

05:25.074 --> 05:28.702
You haven't told these guys
what they're doing in the wedding yet.

05:28.870 --> 05:31.413
Um, well, they're not in the wedding.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.248
What?

05:37.211 --> 05:38.879
Well...

05:39.255 --> 05:41.590
...this is really awkward.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.426
Oh, and I can leave.

05:45.428 --> 05:49.931
I'm sorry, you guys. But Mike's got
his brother and his friends from school.

05:50.099 --> 05:52.100
So, you know, you were...

05:52.268 --> 05:56.688
If it helps, you were next in line.
You just missed the cut.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.231
Oh, man.

05:58.399 --> 06:01.651
This is like figure skating team
all over again.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.573
I mean, synchronized swimming.

06:06.741 --> 06:09.743
I mean...
I mean, the balance beam.

06:09.911 --> 06:11.244
- Help me.
- Football.

06:11.412 --> 06:13.038
Thank you.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.916
Oh, Pheebs, spit that out.
That has pork in it.

06:16.084 --> 06:17.459
Oh! Oh!

06:17.752 --> 06:20.545
I thought the pot stickers
were supposed to be vegetarian?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.632
Yeah, I changed them.
I sent you a fax about it.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.176
I don't have a fax machine.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.971
Huh. Well, then there are gonna be
a few surprises.

06:32.266 --> 06:35.435
I can't believe we're gonna be
the only people not in the wedding.

06:35.603 --> 06:39.147
- I know. I hate being left out of things.
- And it's a wedding.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.067
It'll be weird if I'm not in it.

06:43.319 --> 06:46.154
- Hey, guys, how's it going?
- Fine.

06:46.322 --> 06:51.201
We're sitting here, alone, doing nothing.
It's our rehearsal for tomorrow.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.287
Look, about tomorrow,
I've got a question for you.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.666
I found out one of my groomsmen
had an emergency and can't make it.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.502
- What happened?
- Who cares? And?

07:01.671 --> 07:03.797
And I was wondering
if one of you guys...

07:03.965 --> 07:06.216
- I'll do it!
- Me!

07:07.009 --> 07:09.511
You both wanna do it?
There's only room for one.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.347
Pick me. I look great in a tux,
and I won't steal focus.

07:12.515 --> 07:17.018
No, Mike. No, no, you wanna pick me.
I mean... Watch.

07:19.605 --> 07:20.856
Huh?

07:21.858 --> 07:25.652
You know, I really don't feel
very comfortable making this decision.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.989
You know, Phoebe knows you better.
I'm gonna let her choose.

07:29.740 --> 07:35.203
Well, if Phoebe's choosing, then say
hello to Mike's next groomsman.

07:35.830 --> 07:38.665
Oh, I will. But I will need a mirror...

07:38.833 --> 07:40.876
...as he is me.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.630
- Please. You're going down.
- You are going "downer."

07:45.798 --> 07:47.716
They say that on
the figure skating team?

07:47.884 --> 07:50.635
I wouldn't know. I didn't make it.

07:53.556 --> 07:56.516
You know I'm filling in
for Phoebe's stepdad tomorrow, right?

07:56.684 --> 08:00.228
- Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks for doing that.
- Oh, hey, my pleasure.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.023
So, what are your intentions
with my Phoebe?

08:03.858 --> 08:07.569
- I intend to marry her.
- Oh, a wiseacre.

08:09.572 --> 08:13.700
I understand you plan to support
your wife by playing the piano?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.411
Isn't that kind of unstable?

08:16.662 --> 08:19.498
- No more so than acting.
- Strike two.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.919
You're right.
She probably will support me.

08:24.086 --> 08:26.338
Hey, unless we move in with you, Dad.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.591
Strike three.

08:30.259 --> 08:32.092
You only get one more, Mike.

08:35.181 --> 08:38.015
So? What did you decide?

08:38.308 --> 08:40.727
I decided to pee.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.397
You have to choose one of us
to be in your wedding.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.942
- One of the groomsmen fell out.
- Oh, no, no.

08:47.109 --> 08:50.737
I can't choose between you two.
I love you both so much.

08:50.905 --> 08:54.574
Just not enough to put us
in the original wedding party.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.452
But I don't wanna choose.
It's...

08:57.703 --> 08:59.579
- Okay, wait. Rach?
- Yeah?

08:59.747 --> 09:03.124
Listen, I have a very special
bridesmaid task for you to do.

09:03.459 --> 09:05.252
Goody! What is it?

09:05.419 --> 09:07.796
Well, there's a spot open
for only one groomsman...

09:07.964 --> 09:11.633
...and you have to choose between Ross
and Chandler. So good luck with that.

09:11.842 --> 09:14.553
What? What, what, what?
No, I don't wanna do that.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.638
I guess I have to find a new bridesmaid.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.557
I'll do it!

09:18.766 --> 09:20.809
Okay, it's 2100 hours.

09:20.977 --> 09:23.895
- Time for your toast.
- Do I have time to go to the bathroom?

09:24.063 --> 09:28.358
You had a bathroom break at 2030.
Pee on your own time, Mike.

09:30.486 --> 09:33.405
In regards to the toasts, okay,
you wanna keep them short.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.575
Nothing kills a rehearsal dinner
like long speeches. Okay.

09:36.742 --> 09:39.077
You just get in, do your thing,
and get out.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.996
Is that what you say to Chandler?

09:42.748 --> 09:45.500
It's 2101, and I am not amused.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.461
Okay.

09:48.629 --> 09:52.632
The bride and groom
have a few words they'd like to say.

09:54.468 --> 09:56.636
Okay. Hello, everyone.

09:56.804 --> 10:00.932
And thank you all for being here tonight.
So tomorrow's the big event.

10:01.183 --> 10:05.270
Some of you might not know, but Mike
and I didn't get off to the best start.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.815
Yeah. My friend Joey and I...

10:08.983 --> 10:13.361
...decided to fix each other up
with friends. So I...

10:15.698 --> 10:18.199
Oh, okay. I...

10:18.367 --> 10:21.536
I thought about it, and I fixed him up
with my friend Mary Ellen...

10:21.704 --> 10:25.498
...who couldn't be here tonight,
because... It's not...

10:25.666 --> 10:28.293
It's not important.
Well, she's in rehab.

10:28.919 --> 10:33.673
Anyway. So Joey said that he was
fixing me up with his friend Mike...

10:33.841 --> 10:38.053
...only he didn't have a friend Mike,
so he just brought my Mike. And... And...

10:40.056 --> 10:43.391
But despite, you know...
It got good.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.855
I wanna take a moment to mention
my mother, who couldn't be here.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.732
Oh, God.

10:50.941 --> 10:53.151
And... And moment's over.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.321
So okay... Oh, no, forget that.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.573
I can forget that. Oh, this is funny.

10:58.741 --> 11:02.243
Oh, but you need to know that
to get that.

11:02.453 --> 11:05.080
So... Oh, well, okay.

11:05.331 --> 11:07.499
I... Okay.

11:07.958 --> 11:10.669
Okay, Monica, I can't do it like this!

11:11.587 --> 11:15.507
This is my wedding, okay?
I don't want this...

11:15.675 --> 11:18.176
Or this... Or this...

11:18.344 --> 11:20.595
Okay? I just wanted a simple wedding...

11:20.763 --> 11:24.057
...where my fiancé can go
to the bathroom any time he wants!

11:27.770 --> 11:30.021
- You know what? You're done.
- What?

11:30.189 --> 11:32.023
You're fired!

11:33.275 --> 11:34.901
Cheers.

11:44.495 --> 11:47.122
- Hey.
- Happy wedding day.

11:47.289 --> 11:48.957
Happy my wedding day to you.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.460
Joey, listen, this is gonna be
bridesmaid central, all right?

11:52.628 --> 11:55.004
We're gonna have hair and makeup
in the bathroom.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.758
I had to move a couple things in the
fridge to make room for the corsages.

11:58.926 --> 12:02.470
Man! I wouldn't have had breakfast
if I knew there was gonna be corsages.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.309
Hi.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.479
About last night...

12:11.647 --> 12:14.315
I know you're under
a lot of stress, and...

12:14.483 --> 12:18.653
Well, even though the things you said
hurt me a little bit...

12:20.448 --> 12:21.948
My point is...

12:22.116 --> 12:24.659
Well, I'm willing to take my job back.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.121
Oh, well, that's okay.

12:29.039 --> 12:33.334
I think you and I will do much better
if you're just here as a bridesmaid.

12:34.336 --> 12:37.213
Oh, is that so?

12:37.381 --> 12:38.715
Okay.

12:38.883 --> 12:41.342
If that's really what you want,
then here.

12:41.510 --> 12:44.679
I give you the headset. I don't really
wanna give you the headset.

12:45.890 --> 12:50.393
I guess if you're taking over, then you
should probably return these messages.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.812
- This is a lot.
- Uh-huh.

12:52.980 --> 12:55.857
But I'm sure you can handle this.
I have won awards...

12:56.025 --> 12:59.194
...for my organizational skills.
But I'm sure you'll do fine.

12:59.361 --> 13:02.781
- You've won awards?
- I printed them out on my computer.

13:04.825 --> 13:06.201
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:06.368 --> 13:08.328
- Where's Rach?
- She's in her room. Why?

13:08.537 --> 13:11.039
I have to talk to her
about this groomsman situation.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.876
I'm not gonna watch Chandler up there
while I'm in the seats like some chump.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.092
My God, you're breathtaking.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.555
What do you want?

13:28.015 --> 13:31.684
You haven't by any chance
chosen a groomsman yet, have you?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.521
Ross, please don't make this
harder than it already is.

13:34.688 --> 13:37.565
I'm not. I'm making it easier. Pick me.

13:38.442 --> 13:41.903
- Chandler said it's important to him too.
- Listen. Listen.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.865
Whoever you pick is gonna
walk down the aisle with you.

13:46.033 --> 13:49.577
Now, I promise I won't say a word.
But if you pick Chandler...

13:49.745 --> 13:53.331
...he's gonna be whispering stupid jokes
in your ear the whole time.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.417
Oh, you are the lesser of two evils.

13:56.585 --> 13:58.378
Yes!

14:03.342 --> 14:07.262
Sven, I don't understand what you're
saying. What is wrong with the flowers?

14:07.429 --> 14:09.764
"Lorkins"? What the hell are "lorkins"?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.266
I know.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.769
- Hey.
- Mike, if you were Swedish...

14:14.937 --> 14:18.439
...and you were saying the word
"lorkins," what flower would that be?

14:18.941 --> 14:20.483
- Orchids?
- Right there!

14:20.651 --> 14:23.778
That's why I'm marrying you.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.453
Hello, Michael.

14:32.913 --> 14:34.622
Joseph.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.293
May I have a word with you, please?

14:48.637 --> 14:50.471
This is...

14:50.639 --> 14:52.473
...great.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.809
Have a seat.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.606
Last night...

15:00.274 --> 15:03.902
...I tried to welcome you into my family.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.699
And instead, you disrespect me.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.534
I cannot allow this.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.914
Are you rehearsing
for some really bad Mafia movie?

15:16.498 --> 15:18.166
More back talk.

15:19.043 --> 15:24.464
And yes, I may be borrowing a few lines
from my recent unsuccessful audition...

15:24.632 --> 15:28.301
...for Family Honor 2:
This A-Time It's A-Personal.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.306
Joey, I kind of have a lot to do today.
What do you want?

15:33.474 --> 15:35.642
I want you to take this seriously!

15:35.809 --> 15:38.978
Phoebe is very,
very important to me, okay?

15:39.146 --> 15:41.564
I wanna make sure
you are gonna take care of her.

15:43.317 --> 15:45.526
Joe, I love Phoebe.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.862
She's the most important thing
in my life.

15:48.030 --> 15:51.074
I'd die before I let
anything happen to her.

15:52.701 --> 15:55.828
That's what I wanted to hear.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.831
Because she's family, okay?

15:58.999 --> 16:00.833
And now you're gonna be family.

16:01.001 --> 16:06.172
And there's nothing more important
in the whole world than family.

16:06.382 --> 16:08.591
That must have been one lousy movie.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.760
That was me!

16:13.847 --> 16:16.349
- Hi.
- Let's talk about this groomsman thing.

16:16.517 --> 16:19.394
If you pick Ross, he'll walk you
down the aisle just fine.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.521
But if you choose me...

16:21.689 --> 16:24.065
...you'll be getting some comedy.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.778
Even so...

16:31.740 --> 16:33.950
...I think I'm gonna pick Ross.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.910
Let me tell you
why you need to pick me.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.245
Okay.

16:38.414 --> 16:43.251
See, when I was a kid, you know,
I was always left out of everything...

16:43.419 --> 16:46.462
...and it really made me feel insecure.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.633
I was always picked last in gym...

16:50.801 --> 16:54.762
...even behind that fat exchange student
who didn't know the rules to baseball.

16:54.930 --> 16:58.641
I mean, this guy would strike out
and then run to third.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.980
Anyway, if I'm the only one
left out of this wedding...

17:04.147 --> 17:08.317
...I just know that all those feelings
are gonna come rushing back.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.655
All right, fine, I pick you.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.615
Yes!

17:15.284 --> 17:18.744
Make "groom" for Chandler.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.583
Oh, my.

17:25.335 --> 17:29.672
No, we're gonna do it my way.
Because your way is stupid.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.551
All right, I got to go.
I have another call, Reverend.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.512
Hello?

17:36.680 --> 17:38.765
- I'm glad we had this little talk.
- Yes.

17:38.932 --> 17:41.809
And thanks for all
the wedding night advice.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.437
That didn't make me
uncomfortable at all.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.856
All right, so I'll see everybody tonight.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.357
- Okay.
- Bye.

17:52.821 --> 17:56.491
Did you guys know that there's
a giant ice sculpture in the hall?

17:56.658 --> 17:58.701
Oh, my God, what's it doing here?

17:58.869 --> 18:02.997
I guess it got sent to the billing address
as opposed to the shipping address.

18:03.165 --> 18:07.460
- What a pickle.
- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.

18:07.628 --> 18:10.171
Why is this happening to me?

18:10.672 --> 18:14.008
How bad do you wanna
stick your tongue on that?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.517
- How's it going?
- Good.

18:22.726 --> 18:27.647
I'm just getting some coffee
so I'm alert for the wedding.

18:28.148 --> 18:30.691
That's what I was doing too.

18:30.859 --> 18:34.028
Well, you have fun tonight.

18:34.196 --> 18:37.031
- You too.
- Oh, I will.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.741
Me too.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.666
Wait a minute. I know why I'm being
such an ass. Why are you?

18:47.376 --> 18:50.920
- I'm not supposed to tell you.
- I'm not supposed to tell you.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.215
You told us both
we could be in the wedding?

18:55.050 --> 18:59.053
In my defense, you weren't
supposed to tell each other!

19:00.013 --> 19:02.765
Rachel, only one of us can do it.
You have to choose.

19:02.933 --> 19:05.560
You and me together again.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.604
Rach, Rach? Knock-knock.

19:08.772 --> 19:10.940
- Who's there?
- I'll tell you at the wedding.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.068
Hey, I forgot my scarf.

19:14.236 --> 19:17.113
I can't do this. I don't know
which one of you guys to pick.

19:17.281 --> 19:20.408
Oh, you haven't picked yet?
Oh, good, because I had an idea.

19:20.576 --> 19:25.580
I thought it would be fun if the third
groomsman was my family dog, Chappy.

19:25.789 --> 19:29.083
What? A dog?
No. Rachel gets to choose.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.587
Wow, this is a tough one.

19:32.754 --> 19:34.755
I think I'm gonna have to go
with the dog.

19:36.300 --> 19:39.927
So, what you're saying is
that the chef is at the Hamilton Club...

19:40.095 --> 19:44.223
...but the food is not? And the drinks
are there but the bartender is not?

19:44.391 --> 19:47.727
Are you freaking kidding me?

19:48.562 --> 19:50.271
How's it going?

19:50.439 --> 19:52.273
- Help me.
- What?

19:52.441 --> 19:55.276
I want you to be crazy bitch again.

19:57.112 --> 19:58.779
Really?

19:59.448 --> 20:00.781
Please?

20:01.617 --> 20:05.953
- You really want me to come back?
- More than I wanna get married.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.167
Okay, people, we are back in business!

20:11.335 --> 20:15.087
Oh, God, I have missed you
so much. Okay.

20:15.255 --> 20:18.090
Get your hair and makeup done.
I'll take care of everything.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.927
- Hey, what are you guys gonna do?
- About what?

20:21.094 --> 20:23.137
The blizzard.
I just saw on the news...

20:23.305 --> 20:25.181
...it's the worst snowstorm
in 20 years.

20:25.349 --> 20:28.309
They already closed
all the bridges and tunnels.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.480
But the band and the photographer
are coming in from New Jersey.

20:32.648 --> 20:34.649
I don't think they are.

20:34.983 --> 20:38.527
Ha-ha! Looks like you're not gonna be
in the wedding, either.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.822
So sorry, Pheebs.

20:53.293 --> 20:57.505
- Well, the club lost its power.
- The news said most of the city did.

20:57.714 --> 21:00.675
- Since when do you watch the news?
- For your information...

21:00.842 --> 21:03.886
...since they hired
a very hot weather girl.

21:04.846 --> 21:07.181
I can't believe you aren't
getting married today.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.308
I know.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.521
It's so beautiful out there. You always
wanted to get married outside.

21:13.689 --> 21:16.315
- Why don't you just do it on the street?
- What?

21:16.483 --> 21:19.193
Well, look, it's hardly snowing anymore.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.697
I mean, you couldn't ask
for a more romantic setting.

21:22.864 --> 21:25.574
This could be the simple wedding
you've always wanted.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.452
What do you think?

21:29.913 --> 21:32.331
I think I wanna get married to you today.

21:34.251 --> 21:38.212
Me too. Monica, do you think
we could do it?

21:39.881 --> 21:41.507
Affirmative!

21:49.182 --> 21:51.517
Okay, let's get these chairs out here!

21:51.685 --> 21:54.312
Gunther, hit the Christmas lights.

21:59.276 --> 22:00.526
Ah.

22:01.236 --> 22:06.574
Okay, who left the ice sculpture
on the steam grate?

22:07.868 --> 22:11.662
- Michael.
- Hey, you made it. Great. Chappy!

22:11.830 --> 22:14.874
- There you go.
- Hi. Hi.

22:15.751 --> 22:18.919
I know getting married in the street
isn't what you approve of.

22:19.087 --> 22:24.467
No, it's lovely. The lights and the snow.
I could look at them forever.

22:24.676 --> 22:26.802
I crushed a pill and put it in her drink.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.014
Come on, sweetheart.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.018
You know, Chappy's too small
to handle all this snow.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.228
Someone has to
walk him down the aisle.

22:36.396 --> 22:38.939
- Would this person be in the wedding?
- I guess.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.649
- I'll do it!
- I'll do it!

22:40.817 --> 22:44.278
Chandler, hello?
I mean, aren't you scared of dogs?

22:44.446 --> 22:47.323
I'm not scared.
I'll just take little Chappy and...

22:47.491 --> 22:50.326
He can sense my fear!
My throat is exposed!

22:50.577 --> 22:55.289
Well, I guess I'm in the wedding then.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.209
He stinks.

22:58.835 --> 23:01.962
Level one alert! I repeat,
level one, this is not a drill!

23:02.130 --> 23:05.716
We have a situation. The minister called.
He's snowed in, he can't make it.

23:05.884 --> 23:07.802
- Oh, no.
- Hey, don't worry.

23:07.969 --> 23:10.179
- I'm still ordained from your wedding.
- Really?

23:10.347 --> 23:14.683
Yeah. You think I'd give up being
a minister and pay to ride the subway?

23:15.268 --> 23:17.770
Ministers don't ride the subway for free.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.273
I had to read the Bible pretty carefully,
but, yeah, we do.

23:22.734 --> 23:25.569
We have to find someone else
to walk Phoebe down the aisle.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.321
I'll do it!

23:31.451 --> 23:33.494
Okay, Mike and Joey, get in position.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.871
Chandler, come with me.

23:41.586 --> 23:46.257
Okay, Joey's doing the ceremony,
and Chandler's giving you away.

23:46.425 --> 23:49.051
Oh, okay. Hi, new Dad.

23:50.804 --> 23:56.809
- So you ready to do this?
- Oh, my God. This is really happening.

23:56.977 --> 24:01.605
- Uh-huh. I'm so happy for you, honey.
- Thank you.

24:01.815 --> 24:05.401
I love you.
Wait, wait! No hugs! The dresses!

24:05.569 --> 24:07.278
- Oh, what the hell.
- Oh, come on.

24:09.281 --> 24:11.240
- I love you guys.
- I love you.

24:11.408 --> 24:15.661
Okay, it's zero hour!
All teams execute on my count!

24:15.829 --> 24:19.331
Let's get this bad boy on the road!

24:19.499 --> 24:21.959
Is it okay I want you
to wear that headset in bed?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.837
I have you scheduled for nudity
at 2300 hours.

24:25.005 --> 24:26.338
Oh, yeah.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.925
Okay, Marjorie, hit it.

24:39.728 --> 24:43.856
- Jeez, Ross. You could've showered.
- It's the dog.

24:46.359 --> 24:49.487
Groomsman? Why are you standing
there? Where's your bridesmaid?

24:49.654 --> 24:52.740
We've got a broken arrow!
Bridesmaid down!

24:52.908 --> 24:55.075
Oh, that's me.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.333
- Ready?
- Okay.

25:02.501 --> 25:05.461
Oh, wait. Oh, no. Wait.

25:09.257 --> 25:12.134
Wow. Aren't you gonna be cold?

25:12.302 --> 25:13.636
I don't care.

25:13.803 --> 25:16.639
I'll be my "something blue."

25:20.185 --> 25:23.020
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.312
My God.

26:05.814 --> 26:08.023
- Aren't you freezing?
- Nuh-uh.

26:13.238 --> 26:16.156
Friends. Family.

26:16.324 --> 26:18.200
Dog.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.746
Thank you all for being here
to witness this blessed event.

26:23.540 --> 26:26.834
The cold has now spread
to my special place...

26:29.379 --> 26:31.505
...so I'm gonna do
the short version of this.

26:32.966 --> 26:35.175
Phoebe and Mike
are perfect for each other.

26:35.343 --> 26:37.595
And I know I speak for everyone here...

26:37.762 --> 26:41.515
...when I wish them
a lifetime of happiness.

26:41.683 --> 26:43.851
Who has the rings?

26:48.189 --> 26:49.857
Okay.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.779
When I was growing up,
I didn't have a normal mom and dad...

26:55.989 --> 26:58.866
...or a regular family like everybody else.

26:59.034 --> 27:02.494
And I always knew
that something was missing.

27:04.414 --> 27:06.790
But now I'm standing here today...

27:07.000 --> 27:10.919
...knowing that I have everything
I'm ever gonna need.

27:11.254 --> 27:13.589
You are my family.

27:22.724 --> 27:25.142
Phoebe, you are so beautiful.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.395
You're so kind. You're so generous.

27:28.563 --> 27:31.023
You're so wonderfully weird.

27:33.610 --> 27:36.570
Every day with you is an adventure.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.573
And I can't believe how lucky I am.

27:39.741 --> 27:43.243
And I can't wait
to share my life with you forever.

27:46.164 --> 27:48.749
Oh, wait! Oh, I forgot. And...

27:48.917 --> 27:50.334
...I love you.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.837
And you have nice eyes.

27:55.548 --> 27:57.549
I love you too.

27:57.801 --> 27:59.343
- Joey?
- Yeah?

27:59.552 --> 28:02.805
Chappy's heart rate
has slowed way down.

28:04.599 --> 28:07.101
Okay. Phoebe...

28:07.268 --> 28:10.020
...do you take this man
to be your husband?

28:10.188 --> 28:11.814
I do.

28:12.857 --> 28:14.316
Oh...

28:14.484 --> 28:18.612
Mike, do you take this woman
to be your wife?

28:18.780 --> 28:20.614
I do.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.785
I now pronounce you...

28:24.953 --> 28:27.996
...husband and wife.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.839
I got married!

28:40.885 --> 28:43.887
Could someone get me a coat?
I'm frigging freezing.

28:52.313 --> 28:54.481
- It really was an incredible wedding.
- It was.

28:54.649 --> 28:56.817
I kind of don't want it to end.
Hey...

28:56.985 --> 29:00.028
...you wanna come in for a drink
and a bite of corsage?

29:00.905 --> 29:02.906
I'd love to, but it's 2300 hours...

29:03.074 --> 29:06.827
...and I'm about to have the most
organized sex anyone's ever had.

29:06.995 --> 29:09.204
- Whatever happened to Ross?
- I don't know.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.832
Maybe he hooked up with that
hot girl he talked to.

29:12.000 --> 29:15.335
Come on, Chappy! Do your business!
Make!

29:16.880 --> 29:18.797
Make!

29:20.717 --> 29:22.718
I did not sign on for this.
