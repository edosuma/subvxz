00:02.044 --> 00:03.206
<i>Previously on</i> Justified...

00:03.337 --> 00:05.744
I'll go talk to Mags. She likes me.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.672
Retty?

00:07.799 --> 00:09.175
Don't say anything about us growing.

00:09.301 --> 00:11.044
She already knows, Daddy.

00:13.138 --> 00:14.965
I call it apple pie.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.971
It was already in the
glass, not in the jar.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.219
Loretta...

00:22.356 --> 00:23.731
I'll raise her myself.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.690
I kicked a hornets' nest last night.

00:33.825 --> 00:36.826
And I need you to know
if you find yourself in trouble,

00:36.954 --> 00:39.361
any kind, you can call me.

00:40.415 --> 00:43.831
Black Pike needs your
Indian Line property...

00:43.961 --> 00:45.669
We're not signing that
land over to anyone.

00:45.796 --> 00:49.628
We have got to say, "No, thank you," to Miss
Carol Johnson here and Black Pike Mining.

00:49.758 --> 00:52.166
Which is why I have
put up my own money

00:52.302 --> 00:54.094
to stop the landowners

00:54.221 --> 00:57.008
from selling their rights away
to the mining company.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.255
Boyd.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.887
I figured it out.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.519
I know what Mags is up to.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.485
Hold still now, honey. Tangled
up like a beaver dam back here.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.402
I ain't altogether sure about this dress.

01:16.535 --> 01:17.946
Well, I am.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.867
You look pretty as a picture in it.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.406
Feels like I'm putting on airs.

01:25.752 --> 01:29.417
Daddy would say dresses is for folks
who tell folks like us what to do.

01:29.548 --> 01:33.332
Well, your daddy's got his ways,
and I got mine.

01:34.636 --> 01:37.008
Miss Mags,

01:37.139 --> 01:39.178
he ever ask about me?

01:40.600 --> 01:42.593
He's been real busy.

01:44.646 --> 01:47.600
I miss hearing his voice.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.817
You reckon the next time he calls,
I could have a word?

01:52.154 --> 01:54.063
Next time he calls.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.861
Now, look here.

02:00.245 --> 02:04.077
There ain't no shame
in a woman looking beautiful.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.121
My time has passed.
Ain't nothing for it.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.587
But you...

02:13.717 --> 02:15.710
You got something.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.509
Power you haven't even
come to understand.

02:19.639 --> 02:23.803
That was my grandmama's
before she passed it on to my mama.

02:23.935 --> 02:26.853
I coveted it as long
as I could remember.

02:27.856 --> 02:30.394
She give it to me when I turned 16.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.983
I lit up like a firecracker.

02:39.576 --> 02:40.857
There.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.747
What do you think?

02:47.876 --> 02:49.869
I don't know. What do you think?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.755
I think them boys are never
gonna know what hit 'em.

02:53.256 --> 02:56.341
Ma, ice cream man outside want
to know where to park his vehicle.

02:56.468 --> 02:59.919
Coover, you ever hear of knocking on a
woman's door before you fling it open?

03:00.055 --> 03:02.546
- I just...
- "I was just... I was just..."

03:02.682 --> 03:04.971
Just ignorant is what.

03:05.102 --> 03:08.767
You're filthy as a shoat. You hadn't bathed
in a week, and us with company at the door.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.605
You got any shame at all?

03:10.732 --> 03:14.812
Now go on! Get out of here
before I chase you out with a belt! Go!

03:16.738 --> 03:20.522
I used to tell people I dropped him
on his head when he was a baby.

03:20.659 --> 03:24.787
Truth is I got no excuse for him.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.706
You're like a dream come true
for this old girl.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.124
That's definitely an A.
Yeah, there you go.

04:15.255 --> 04:19.122
Fella in the musty suit
runs the railroad line out of Loyall.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.964
Gotta watch him. He'll grab your fanny,

04:22.095 --> 04:25.713
but he's a good man to acquaint
yourself with nonetheless.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.885
- You know all these folks?
- I know the ones worth knowing.

04:29.019 --> 04:32.352
Dickie, hell.
I ain't paying that band to tune all day.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.473
I'm on it, Ma. Hey!

04:35.609 --> 04:39.143
How far away are y'all from making
some actual goddamn music?

04:39.279 --> 04:41.022
What do you say?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.649
Well, shit! Look at this.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.494
You lose your way, Crowder?

04:57.631 --> 05:00.501
It can get tricky up these hollers.
I figure you must have took a wrong turn.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.338
Well, I thought Mags extended
that invitation to everybody.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.877
I just assumed it was a plus-one.

05:06.973 --> 05:10.140
Well, y'all ain't invited. Gonna be
a scene dragging you out of here?

05:10.268 --> 05:13.720
We ain't looking for trouble, Doyle.
We're just looking to have a word.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.931
Well, I'm listening.

05:16.066 --> 05:17.809
With your mama.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.943
Mags is busy.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.193
Well, we can wait.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.608
Boyd, y'all ain't welcome.

05:27.077 --> 05:30.197
Now, you're gonna bounce
one way or the other.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.698
Doyle, your mama needs to hear
what I got to say.

05:33.834 --> 05:37.000
You think I'd come up
in this holler otherwise?

05:39.130 --> 05:40.790
Y'all wait here.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.760
You all right?

05:45.887 --> 05:47.963
- Never been better.
- Ava.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.260
I'm with you.

05:49.391 --> 05:52.095
This is a picnic on a Sunday afternoon.

05:52.978 --> 05:55.054
Wish I'd packed a basket.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.643
What happened? Sugar high wear off?

06:41.484 --> 06:43.062
I'm good.

06:43.194 --> 06:46.361
Well, get up there
and lay a chunk of firewood on her still.

06:46.489 --> 06:47.604
Why?

06:48.408 --> 06:52.192
Paying respect. Show her you're
here with peaceful intent.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.871
Who says I am?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.010
Hey, they're pretty good.

07:09.137 --> 07:10.548
They're better than pretty good.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.139
Why aren't you up there?

07:12.265 --> 07:14.507
Well, I never was much for clogging.

07:14.643 --> 07:18.261
I had a cousin, next county over.
Called him Heinz.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.389
- Heinz?
- Yeah, like the steak sauce.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.568
Claimed he knew 57 dance steps
that no one else had ever done before.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.185
- Why isn't he here?
- His wife shot him.

07:27.322 --> 07:31.189
Well, if it isn't that pretty lady
that spoke at the church.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.994
My Lord, you are a picture up close.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.781
Hobart Curtis.

07:36.915 --> 07:40.414
I see you've been at the punch bowl
a few times already, huh?

07:40.543 --> 07:42.335
This one your date?

07:42.462 --> 07:45.416
'Cause I'd allow you could do better.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.882
And worse, I suppose. Mr. Curtis, is it?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.386
Hobart.

07:50.512 --> 07:53.085
But, darlin', you look at me
with them big green eyes,

07:53.223 --> 07:55.429
you can call me anything you like.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.516
My eyes are brown, Mr. Curtis.

07:57.644 --> 08:00.479
Now what you need to do is come
out on the dance floor with me

08:00.605 --> 08:02.349
and let me show you how to move.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.771
- Hobart.
- Excuse us, Marshal.

08:04.901 --> 08:08.685
I can't abide you laying your hands
on Miss Johnson without her invitation.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.110
You understand.

08:11.241 --> 08:14.195
Sure. Yeah, I get it.

08:14.327 --> 08:17.696
She struts in here
shaking that little Ivy League ass,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.452
lay hands on whatever she sees fit.

08:20.583 --> 08:25.411
Blow the top off of it, send it down the
hill into my creek. That's just fine.

08:25.547 --> 08:27.041
But I so much as touch her...

08:30.260 --> 08:34.008
Hey, hey. Stay back, all right?
Now, now, nothing happening here.

08:34.139 --> 08:36.808
I think he got it.
Let's just go back to dancing.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.842
It's all right. Go back to dancing.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.183
What do we got here?

08:41.312 --> 08:45.061
See, I was under the impression
we got ourselves a party here.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.563
Am I right, or am I damn right?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.936
- Damn right.
- Thank you so much.

08:50.071 --> 08:54.484
Well, let's get some party shit going
on here, then. What do you say?

08:55.952 --> 08:57.743
- Raylan.
- Dickie.

08:57.871 --> 09:02.616
I think Hobart had sampled your
mama's punch beyond his capacity.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.372
That right? Hobart...

09:07.714 --> 09:10.287
You and me had a talk about polite.

09:10.425 --> 09:14.375
- God. Hey, hey.
- Take a look at that finger. Easy, easy.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.260
- What?
- What?

09:27.525 --> 09:29.897
Miss Ava. Enjoying the party?

09:30.028 --> 09:34.405
I'm finding it ever more tiresome
as it grows on, actually.

09:34.532 --> 09:36.821
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.158
Boyd, I see you managed
to find your way in.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.988
- I have my charms, Miss Johnson.
- I do not doubt it.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.666
Do you by chance have news for me?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.999
I stopped by Helen and Arlo Givens'
on the way over

09:47.128 --> 09:49.287
and was able to highlight the pluses
and mitigate the minuses.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.667
So you got it?

09:51.049 --> 09:53.006
We managed to come
to an agreement, yes.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.794
No shit, Boyd.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.963
That is excellent news.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.389
I knew I could count on you.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.768
You sure you know what you're doing?

10:06.898 --> 10:10.148
I'm making it up as I go, but I sure
am happy you elected to come along.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.936
You're sure you don't want none?

10:12.070 --> 10:14.857
- No, I'm fine.
- This makes you more grown up.

10:14.989 --> 10:17.278
You Bill Carroll's kid?

10:17.408 --> 10:18.951
That's right. What of it?

10:22.831 --> 10:25.238
Puts you just shy of your
21st birthday, then.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.573
So?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.995
So you might want to think about how much
you want to be blowing out your candles

10:30.130 --> 10:32.917
at the Harlan County detention centre.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.299
Yeah. Get.

10:42.267 --> 10:44.639
How do you know you didn't just
scare off my future husband?

10:44.769 --> 10:48.719
What, that guy? Come on.
You can do better than that.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.267
Marshal, I don't mean
to give you offence,

10:50.400 --> 10:53.105
but I don't need you looking after
who I talk to.

10:53.236 --> 10:55.145
I got Daddy for that.

11:15.425 --> 11:18.094
Mrs. Bennett.
Quite an event you put on here.

11:18.219 --> 11:21.754
Glad you could make it.
You had a taste of my apple pie yet?

11:21.890 --> 11:22.885
No, ma'am. Not yet.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.637
Well, you don't want to miss it.

11:27.478 --> 11:28.854
We should talk.

11:28.980 --> 11:32.930
Miss Johnson, this is a party.
Let your hair down a bit.

11:33.526 --> 11:36.195
I'm a bit partied out.
I got a flight to catch.

11:36.321 --> 11:39.606
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, sweetie.

11:39.741 --> 11:41.235
You take care now.

11:42.619 --> 11:46.830
Mags, you can condescend to me like I'm some
carpetbagging shit stepper all you like,

11:46.956 --> 11:50.159
but I speak with the full authority
of the company who employs me.

11:50.293 --> 11:54.706
I walk away from here now, there is
no deal, and there never will be.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.674
Black Pike will take your mountain
and blow the top off of it,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.920
and the Bennett clan will get nothing.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.426
You still have nothing to say?

12:06.309 --> 12:08.100
Miss Johnson, wait.

12:10.730 --> 12:12.557
Look around you.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.813
All you see here,

12:14.943 --> 12:19.106
this whole way of life has roots
sunk deep in this mountain.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.022
If you truly think you can put
a price on all this, well...

12:25.161 --> 12:26.904
I ain't heard it yet.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.539
Well, okay, then.

12:30.667 --> 12:33.502
No, no, Raylan, Raylan, this is
just between Mags and me, okay?

12:33.628 --> 12:34.826
I need you to wait outside.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.623
If I can't see you, I can't protect you.

12:36.756 --> 12:39.377
You're gonna be right outside, okay?

12:39.509 --> 12:42.047
Making me what, a doorman?

12:42.178 --> 12:45.381
Yes, a supremely
overqualified doorman. Just...

12:45.515 --> 12:49.809
No matter what happens, don't let
anyone in there, none of her kin.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.311
Okay.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.194
For luck.

13:11.582 --> 13:13.741
- Hey, Boyd.
- Carol.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.205
What are you doing here?

13:15.336 --> 13:19.251
You don't mind if Boyd sits in
on our little powwow, do you?

13:21.300 --> 13:24.301
You said you signed
the Indian Line property, correct?

13:24.429 --> 13:26.505
Well, that's the fact of it, yes.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.426
Well, then, you've done very well,
and you can go.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.635
There's just one wrinkle to that.

13:31.769 --> 13:36.099
The lease rights to the Indian Line
property now lie solely with me.

13:38.693 --> 13:42.192
Well, I hope you understand.
This is just business.

13:44.157 --> 13:49.613
And have you decided what you plan
on doing with that property, Boyd?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.913
Have a seat, Miss Johnson.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.294
Raylan. Ray.

14:00.423 --> 14:03.756
Can't let you in there just now, Dickie.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.376
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.762
Meeting going on.
You're not on the guest list.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.717
You are attempting to bar me,

14:13.853 --> 14:16.261
"attempting" being the key word here,

14:16.397 --> 14:18.520
from entering my very own home.

14:18.649 --> 14:22.315
It's your mama's home, Dickie.
Try and keep it in perspective.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.603
Well, do pardon me, Raylan.

14:24.739 --> 14:27.277
I will do my perspective-keeping best.

14:27.408 --> 14:29.864
But here's the thing, Raylan.

14:29.994 --> 14:33.908
I'm going in that door.
You know that, don't you?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.531
I know I'd like to see you try.

14:51.349 --> 14:53.057
How y'all doing?

14:54.102 --> 14:56.178
Here's the thing, Raylan.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.435
Am I not the heir apparent
to the family business?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.723
I got a right to be there.
Mama would want me to be there.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.234
- Doesn't appear so. No.
- Mama!

15:02.360 --> 15:05.693
Dickie, if your mama
wanted you in there,

15:05.822 --> 15:07.861
I think you'd be in there, don't you?

15:22.338 --> 15:25.505
You want to cut to the chase?
Fine. Here it is.

15:25.633 --> 15:30.710
Black Pike Mining is prepared to
offer you a cash buy out in the sum...

15:30.847 --> 15:33.468
May I? I am writing here.

15:44.986 --> 15:46.361
My word.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.733
Yes. You can see by that number
that we're serious.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.820
This is a one-time-only,
non-negotiable deal.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.866
You take it, we shake, we're done,
and I never darken your door again.

15:56.998 --> 16:01.743
You say no, you play games, you stall,
I walk out, and it goes to the lawyers.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.119
Do we have an agreement?

16:06.257 --> 16:09.174
No, Miss Johnson, I don't believe we do.

16:11.179 --> 16:14.014
Well, then I got nothing else to say.

16:14.140 --> 16:15.883
You don't want to hear
my counter-offer?

16:16.017 --> 16:17.559
There is no counter-offer.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.057
It's this,
or we go with eminent domain.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.848
Your family's history?

16:21.981 --> 16:25.315
Getting this property seized is
an inevitability.

16:25.776 --> 16:29.395
You wouldn't be the first who tried,
missy thing.

16:29.530 --> 16:32.282
Now, sit your bony ass down
and listen to my counter-offer

16:32.408 --> 16:36.026
while there's still pieces
of you big enough to find.

16:42.251 --> 16:46.379
I will accept a payout from Black Pike
for easements on my mountain.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.376
I believe we can settle for, say...

16:51.344 --> 16:55.424
Triple the amount scratched
on this piece of parchment.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.264
I'm not finished.

16:57.391 --> 17:00.677
We will also take a four percent stake
in the company.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.978
Not Black Pike,
lest they pack up, declare bankruptcy,

17:04.106 --> 17:06.182
and disappear with
what's coming to me.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.982
No, I want a piece of the company
that owns Black Pike.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.570
A legacy deal.

17:14.407 --> 17:18.868
Sufficient to provide for my kin
and this community for generations to come.

17:18.996 --> 17:22.864
Short of that, we got
nothing to talk about.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.128
Mags, you haven't
done your homework.

17:27.255 --> 17:31.039
The properties you're holding out
are worthless for coal.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.504
Parking lots and hillsides.

17:32.635 --> 17:35.920
Why in God's name would
my company agree to that deal?

17:36.055 --> 17:39.506
Well, it's not about the coal,
Miss Johnson. It never was.

17:39.642 --> 17:41.017
Then what?

17:41.143 --> 17:43.136
Look at a map, honey.

17:43.271 --> 17:46.971
State roads can't carry coal trucks up
that mountain.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.100
No way to get 'em there.

17:50.278 --> 17:52.484
You want the riches
atop this piece of Appalachia,

17:52.613 --> 17:55.733
you gonna have to build your own road.

17:55.866 --> 18:00.327
And the road you need to build
runs through the properties I hold.

18:03.124 --> 18:06.243
So Boyd here sussed it out,

18:06.377 --> 18:10.624
looked at the pinch points for grading
a lane wide enough for your trucks.

18:10.756 --> 18:14.172
He come to me, and we worked
out a little deal of our own.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.465
The Indian Line property owned by Helen
and Arlo Givens is the last parcel.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.801
I was able to convince them
to put their trust in me.

18:21.934 --> 18:26.062
Yeah. Without that property,
without them, without me,

18:27.106 --> 18:30.973
there is no Green Mountain project.
Nor will there ever be.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.604
Black Pike will cut its losses

18:32.737 --> 18:35.987
and move on to the next hill
with empty hands.

18:39.660 --> 18:43.528
Sugar. They didn't tell you that,
did they?

18:44.915 --> 18:46.873
Sent you in blind to close the deal

18:47.001 --> 18:50.584
without ever clueing you in
on the particulars.

18:50.713 --> 18:53.334
Funny way to run a business.

18:53.466 --> 18:54.876
But, then...

18:56.635 --> 18:58.593
You pick the devil you run with.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.056
I have to make a call.

19:05.061 --> 19:06.934
Go ahead, honey.

19:07.063 --> 19:08.806
Go, go. Yeah.

19:09.857 --> 19:12.146
We'll be right here waiting.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.956
Well, Mags, I spoke with my people,

19:29.085 --> 19:32.288
and you got yourself a deal.

19:33.881 --> 19:35.874
I expected I might.

19:36.008 --> 19:39.591
I've worked with Black Pike for four years,
six years before that with Henley Coal.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.262
And never in all that time

19:41.389 --> 19:45.007
have I seen a company
lay down the way they have here.

19:45.142 --> 19:47.099
I'd call it a blessing,

19:47.228 --> 19:50.893
a chance to learn new things
in this tired old world.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.815
And all that talk at the meeting,

19:52.942 --> 19:55.611
the whole town looking at you
as if you're the protector

19:55.736 --> 19:58.571
of all that's green and holy in Bennett.

19:58.697 --> 20:01.319
They're gonna blow 1,000 feet
off the top of that mountain,

20:01.450 --> 20:03.739
spill it into your creeks,
wipe out homesteads.

20:03.869 --> 20:05.992
My people have been here
for 200 years, Miss Johnson,

20:06.122 --> 20:07.699
and we will be here
once your people have come in,

20:07.832 --> 20:09.030
and taken what they want and left.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.788
And everyone else,
you just sell them out.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.833
Nothing changes up here, not really.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.752
I've seen the story played out
time and time again before,

20:18.884 --> 20:21.719
as it will happen again
in times yet to come.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.218
I'll take the cash up front,

20:26.350 --> 20:29.102
delivered tomorrow morning first thing.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.895
You want to shake on it?

20:39.029 --> 20:43.027
Up here, that kind of agreement's
just as binding as they come.

20:43.159 --> 20:45.650
You'll hear from our attorneys.

20:45.786 --> 20:48.194
They'll work out the details.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.615
Been a pleasure
doing business with you, Carol.

20:52.752 --> 20:54.376
If you're ever up this way...

20:57.715 --> 21:00.716
Was thinking I was gonna have
to come in there after you.

21:00.843 --> 21:02.800
Can we go?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.091
Sure.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.010
What happened?

21:06.140 --> 21:11.976
Raylan, take me away from here.
I don't care where it is as long as I can get a drink.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.891
You done good, Boyd.

21:18.027 --> 21:21.063
I did what was coming. That's all.

21:21.197 --> 21:24.897
Crowders. Always looking for an angle.

21:25.034 --> 21:27.489
Is there anything else, Mags?

21:28.537 --> 21:31.574
How in the hell did you ever get Arlo
to come over to you?

21:31.707 --> 21:35.835
Mr. Givens can be very practical when
it comes to matters that suit him.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.420
Well...

21:38.839 --> 21:40.583
Whatever you promised him,

21:42.092 --> 21:43.836
whatever you decide to do,

21:43.969 --> 21:47.634
take over your daddy's affairs,
go your own way, whatever,

21:47.765 --> 21:50.885
the county is yours
far as I'm concerned.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.474
I got my family out of all that now.

21:55.773 --> 21:57.267
One thing.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.856
Stay out of the weed business.

22:01.737 --> 22:06.150
It's Bennett territory.
Always has been, always will be.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.882
- Is that it?
- That's it.

22:26.011 --> 22:28.004
- So we go now?
- Ava.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.343
- What?
- Let's dance.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.265
- Boyd.
- Right now.

22:58.836 --> 23:03.130
Winona, starting to feel like
a bit of a stalker here.

23:03.257 --> 23:05.748
Just call me back when you can.

23:05.884 --> 23:09.834
- So what now?
- Flight out of Cincinnati,

23:09.972 --> 23:13.305
stiff vodka tonic on the flight,
pick up cat from my neighbour,

23:13.434 --> 23:17.894
- and then open the file on the next mountain.
- No rest for the weary.

23:18.022 --> 23:23.264
- What about you?
- Well, I drop you off, go back to my room,

23:23.402 --> 23:28.693
open a bottle of Jim Beam, wake up
in the morning, and get my next case.

23:30.492 --> 23:33.114
Save all your love for your dog?

23:34.330 --> 23:36.287
I used to have a dog.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.621
Hey, I have an idea.
I got a couple hours before my flight.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.494
Why don't we just take a sixer with us,

23:40.628 --> 23:44.293
and pull off the side of the road,
and make out like we're in high school.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.831
I might even let you feel me up.

23:48.385 --> 23:52.383
Or we could just skip the drive,
seeing as we're already here.

23:54.016 --> 23:57.681
- Hey, honey. Did you have any fun?
- I did.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.978
Saw you out here, having to beat
those boys off with a stick.

24:01.106 --> 24:03.562
Did you meet any likely suitors?

24:05.653 --> 24:07.028
Anything else you need me to do?

24:07.780 --> 24:12.442
Go see if Coover needs help
wrapping things up, then go play.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.159
Listen. I did something today
gonna change everything.

24:17.122 --> 24:21.334
For me, for my family
here, and for you, too.

24:21.460 --> 24:24.544
From now on out,
things is gonna be different.

24:25.923 --> 24:28.414
Make you proud of your old Mags.

24:30.052 --> 24:32.377
- Come on, Mama, sing something.
- I don't want to sing.

24:32.513 --> 24:34.422
Come on. Come on. Sing one.

24:34.556 --> 24:38.803
Well, all right. What, <i>High on a
Mountain?</i> Start me off, honey.

24:51.365 --> 24:54.152
<i>High on a mountain</i>

24:54.284 --> 24:56.610
<i>Wind blowing free</i>

24:56.745 --> 25:00.446
<i>Thinkin' 'bout the
days that used to be</i>

25:02.501 --> 25:07.875
<i>High on a mountain
standing all alone</i>

25:08.006 --> 25:11.625
<i>Wondering where
the days of my life have gone</i>

25:23.188 --> 25:25.228
<i>As I looked at the
valleys down below</i>

25:25.357 --> 25:28.643
Loretta, give me a hand with this,
will you, girl?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.494
Thank you.

25:39.621 --> 25:42.326
Now drag that other one over here.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.377
You look like a monkey
humping a football.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.087
Come on, let's do it together.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.067
What's wrong, girl?
Look like you seen a ghost.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.748
I better get back inside.

26:32.883 --> 26:34.294
All right.

27:07.167 --> 27:11.913
There's gonna be a big hole in the sky
with that mountain gone.

27:12.047 --> 27:15.416
Well, it's just a mountain.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.169
You really believe that?

27:20.305 --> 27:22.215
Why don't you tell me something?

27:22.349 --> 27:26.429
Was it you set off those firecrackers
at the town hall meeting?

27:28.188 --> 27:30.264
I paid someone to do it.

27:31.191 --> 27:34.809
- How much it cost you?
- Forty bucks and a handful of Xanax.

27:34.945 --> 27:36.772
Nothing, considering.

27:39.741 --> 27:44.154
You really have a soft spot in your
heart for those people, don't you?

27:45.122 --> 27:47.114
Don't you?

27:47.249 --> 27:52.041
- I never could manage it.
- I'm sure they hired you for some reason.

27:52.170 --> 27:54.662
I make-believe good enough.

27:55.966 --> 27:59.335
But in the end, you know,
you are who you are.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.967
- Would have been fun back there, huh?
- Maybe.

28:15.235 --> 28:16.433
Hey.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.030
Hey, yourself, little girl.
What do you want?

28:21.450 --> 28:24.155
Come across something
made me think of you.

28:24.286 --> 28:25.697
What's that?

28:27.664 --> 28:31.876
Just harvested a crop of McCready's
finest red-hair sativa.

28:32.002 --> 28:34.078
Know how much you love it.

28:44.139 --> 28:46.547
- Shit.
- Right?

28:47.809 --> 28:51.854
Well, thanks, I guess.

28:51.980 --> 28:53.439
My pleasure.

28:54.858 --> 28:58.856
You think it'd be all right
if I hung out here a little while?

29:06.370 --> 29:09.205
<i>Now, most rednecks
take their truck into the shop.</i>

29:09.331 --> 29:13.660
<i>But in true thrillbilly style,
Cam's gone in to modify his crapper.</i>

29:15.003 --> 29:16.284
<i>- I don't know.
- It's beautiful.</i>

29:16.421 --> 29:18.081
<i>That's why we came here today.</i>

29:18.215 --> 29:20.966
Sure you don't want to hit this thing?

29:21.093 --> 29:22.801
I got school tomorrow.

29:24.471 --> 29:25.634
Your loss.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.509
Hey, check this out.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.930
You ever seen <i>Fast Times?</i>

29:38.276 --> 29:41.277
You hear that? That's my skull!

29:41.405 --> 29:43.148
I'm so wasted.

29:54.167 --> 29:55.827
Mama likes you.

29:57.254 --> 29:58.831
I can tell.

30:02.134 --> 30:03.925
She took good care of me
while my daddy's away.

30:04.052 --> 30:07.386
Girl, my daddy ain't
never did shit for me.

30:08.390 --> 30:10.347
Never give me nothing.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.682
Hell, her neither.

30:13.812 --> 30:14.975
But you come along,

30:15.105 --> 30:19.981
and she put that hair clip on you like
you was a prize hog at the county fair.

30:23.488 --> 30:25.113
She just wanted me to look right
for the party.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.398
No, Mama has gone soft.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.948
Thinks you're her new prize bunny.

30:33.749 --> 30:36.204
But she never gave me nothing.

30:38.628 --> 30:40.586
Broke up my hand, too.

30:50.265 --> 30:51.510
Your daddy.

30:59.066 --> 31:01.058
You never ask about your daddy.

31:03.278 --> 31:04.772
Why is that?

31:07.366 --> 31:11.494
Well, y'all told me already
that he's working down Texas.

31:11.620 --> 31:15.570
Yeah. He's working.

31:19.378 --> 31:22.082
He's doing his job.

31:22.214 --> 31:25.215
<i>I don't think it's his heart
we're worried about, Wild Bill.</i>

31:25.342 --> 31:29.386
<i>Apparently, you're not supposed
to have two cracks in your ass.</i>

32:38.832 --> 32:40.077
Daddy.

32:49.134 --> 32:52.882
<i>- Loretta?</i>
- Raylan? I'm sorry to bother you. I just...

32:54.139 --> 32:57.555
- Loretta, what is it?
<i>- I knew they'd killed him.</i>

32:57.684 --> 32:59.890
I knew it. I just...

33:01.062 --> 33:04.645
Please help me, Raylan.
I don't know what to do.

33:06.693 --> 33:07.973
Loretta?

33:08.987 --> 33:10.150
What?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.741
What? Think I'm stupid, little girl?

33:22.876 --> 33:24.335
- Is that it?
- Coover!

33:24.461 --> 33:26.786
You think old Coov never smoked
a wet blunt before?

33:26.922 --> 33:29.673
- Like, what, I'm gonna curl up and hibernate?
- What is your problem, man?

33:29.799 --> 33:32.884
This girl brings this joint
like it's this gift she's giving me.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.256
I'm failing to see your
problem here, brother.

33:34.387 --> 33:38.255
She laced it with formaldehyde. Tastes
like I'm smoking a goddamn dead person!

33:38.391 --> 33:41.096
Okay, and yet I doubt you let that
stand in the way of you finishing it.

33:41.228 --> 33:43.516
- I'm still failing to see a problem.
- She...

33:43.647 --> 33:46.434
- Hey!
- Where you going, little sister?

33:46.566 --> 33:47.942
Hey!

33:48.693 --> 33:50.982
You think you're gonna lay me out
that easy, girl?

33:51.112 --> 33:55.062
With a little wet weed? Come on, girl.
You gotta do better than that.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.480
I'm a goddamn professional.

33:56.618 --> 34:00.829
Coover, hey! Look at me. Look at me.
What is it you're trying to do here, now?

34:00.956 --> 34:03.791
Show him what you
got in your hand, girl.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.212
Show him!

34:13.677 --> 34:14.708
Coover. Coover.

34:14.844 --> 34:17.844
- No, I kept it because I knew, Dickie.
- Coover!

34:17.973 --> 34:19.514
'Cause I'm the only one
taking care of us here.

34:19.641 --> 34:23.591
You're taking care of us? Keeping the
damn watch! That's what's going on here.

34:23.728 --> 34:26.398
Mama looking at her
like she's this brand-new baby lamb.

34:26.523 --> 34:29.393
- Good God!
- But I seen what your angle was right away.

34:29.525 --> 34:34.069
To drive a wedge into this family,
to tear us apart from the inside,

34:34.197 --> 34:36.273
- and keep the pieces for herself!
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

34:36.408 --> 34:39.989
But you know what?
I ain't gonna let that happen, girl.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.196
- Coover.
- You want it bad enough to come after me?

34:42.330 --> 34:44.157
- Coover.
- What do you want to know, girl?

34:44.291 --> 34:47.375
- You want to hear how he went?
- You stop that shit right now!

34:47.502 --> 34:48.699
- You want to see your daddy?
- Hey! Hey!

34:48.837 --> 34:50.460
- Want to see your daddy?
- You stop that shit right now!

34:50.588 --> 34:51.583
Hey, Coov! Hey!

34:51.715 --> 34:55.629
I'll take you to see him right now.
Come on. Let's go see him.

34:55.760 --> 34:59.010
Stay back. You think about this. Hey!
Hey! Think about this, now.

34:59.139 --> 35:00.467
Think about what Mama's gonna do.
Think about...

35:00.598 --> 35:01.713
Mama don't need to know about this.

35:01.850 --> 35:03.926
Mama knows everything! You know it.
Everything.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.516
You know it as well as I do, Coover.
Come on.

35:06.646 --> 35:09.932
Come on. Ain't no keeping it from her.
Ain't no keeping it from her.

35:10.066 --> 35:14.360
You know this, Coover. Please.
Come on, brother. Come on.

35:14.487 --> 35:19.196
That's it. That's it.
There is my baby brother right there.

35:19.326 --> 35:22.492
He's back. He's back. He's back!

35:22.620 --> 35:26.784
Here he is.
You know what I think this is?

35:26.916 --> 35:29.621
I think you're just a wee bit jealous

35:29.753 --> 35:32.422
'cause Mama's taken more of a shine
to her than you.

35:32.547 --> 35:34.290
- Don't say that, Dickie.
- Come on, now.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.752
- Don't say that, Dickie.
- Just a wee bit jealous.

35:35.884 --> 35:39.004
- Don't say that, Dickie.
- Come on. A wee...

35:39.137 --> 35:40.928
Don't say that, Dickie!

35:47.437 --> 35:50.224
Coover! Coover! Coover. Coover.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.476
Coover. Coover. Coover! Coover. Hey.

36:11.961 --> 36:15.662
Dickie? Dickie?

36:17.258 --> 36:20.425
Dickie? Dickie?

36:26.893 --> 36:28.684
Hell, no.

36:28.812 --> 36:32.809
Tim. Hey, it's Raylan. I need you to
track a cell for me and get a location.

36:32.941 --> 36:34.139
I need you to do it right now.

36:42.409 --> 36:44.615
- Sorry about this.
- Don't be. I'll manage.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.404
- Your things.
- Forget it. I'll get them when it's done.

36:46.538 --> 36:48.577
Go. Go get her.

37:23.867 --> 37:25.409
Where is she?

37:27.829 --> 37:32.076
I don't know. I don't...
I don't... I don't... Ray!

37:32.208 --> 37:34.699
Now, listen, Dickie.
I will finish what was started here.

37:34.836 --> 37:38.335
- Raylan! Wait. Raylan!
- You're gonna tell me where they went

37:38.465 --> 37:42.296
- if it's the last breath you ever draw.
- I tried to stop him, Raylan.

37:42.427 --> 37:45.463
I swear to God. I did everything I could.
I swear.

37:50.226 --> 37:54.805
Raylan, please! Please, let me...

37:54.939 --> 37:58.308
Just let me go after him. Let me go after him.
I can take care of this, Raylan.

37:58.443 --> 38:01.230
No. I'm gonna take care of this now.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.857
Where?

38:02.989 --> 38:05.029
He said something about taking her
to see her daddy.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.735
Where?

38:06.868 --> 38:09.904
- Up at the mine.
- Where?

38:10.038 --> 38:13.288
Up in the mine shaft,
the Garner mine shaft.

38:15.543 --> 38:17.785
Don't you hurt my brother, Raylan!

38:27.639 --> 38:29.049
Coover!

38:30.683 --> 38:32.094
Coover!

38:37.941 --> 38:39.221
Coover!

39:34.872 --> 39:37.577
Coover! Coover, stop it!

39:38.626 --> 39:41.248
Stop it! Stop!

39:41.379 --> 39:42.957
You're dead, girl.

39:44.591 --> 39:45.753
Coover!

40:40.730 --> 40:42.557
Mama?

40:45.068 --> 40:47.025
Mama, wake up.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.316
What?

40:49.447 --> 40:50.775
Doyle?

40:54.952 --> 40:56.151
What is it?

41:02.418 --> 41:05.419
All right, man. Thank you.
I appreciate it.

41:07.256 --> 41:11.586
Well, they got her to UK Hospital.
Child Protection Services are with her.

41:11.719 --> 41:13.463
They think she's gonna be all right.

41:13.596 --> 41:16.467
You really think she's ever gonna
be all right after all this?

41:16.599 --> 41:19.351
Well, we got him.
He was all the way down at the bottom.

41:20.019 --> 41:21.050
They're lacing him up right now.

41:21.187 --> 41:22.765
They're gonna have him up here
in a couple of minutes.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.055
- All right.
- There's another body down there, too.

41:25.191 --> 41:27.729
- Real bad decomp. Been down there a while.
- That's McCready.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.778
- Man, what is she doing here?
- I'll handle this.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.889
- That my boy up there?
- It is.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.350
- Where's Loretta?
- She's gone.

42:06.983 --> 42:10.566
Raylan, I need to speak to her.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.608
No, Mags. I'm sorry. You can't.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.864
Raylan, please.

42:23.583 --> 42:25.955
I never even got to say goodbye.

42:31.674 --> 42:32.919
Please.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.091
- I just wanted to...
- No.

42:38.181 --> 42:39.758
There's no way.

42:48.858 --> 42:50.186
Let's go.
