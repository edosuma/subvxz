The only time you're ever not
in the mood is when you're...

19:35.181 --> 19:36.581
Oh, God.

19:36.582 --> 19:39.150
Are you thinking about that nasty little...

19:39.151 --> 19:41.553
Is this about Hamilturd?

19:41.554 --> 19:45.390
Oh, my God, it so is.

19:45.391 --> 19:47.926
[exhales deeply]

19:47.927 --> 19:50.128
Okay.

19:50.129 --> 19:51.496
You did a good thing for me,

19:51.497 --> 19:54.432
so I'm gonna do a good thing for you.

19:54.433 --> 19:56.301
Matthew?

19:56.302 --> 20:00.271
Even thought it pains me to say this,

20:00.272 --> 20:03.341
you...

20:03.342 --> 20:07.846
are in love with Jenna Hamilton.

20:07.847 --> 20:11.749
<i>And even though I think it is
a sick, compulsive fetish,</i>

20:11.750 --> 20:16.321
which is obviously incurable,

20:16.322 --> 20:19.190
you have to tell her.

20:19.191 --> 20:21.593
You have to tell her

20:21.594 --> 20:23.394
because if you don't,

20:23.395 --> 20:25.730
you'll be the saddest king in Promland.

20:25.731 --> 20:28.766
And I can't let that happen.

20:28.767 --> 20:30.735
Are you sure?

20:30.736 --> 20:35.373
Go...

20:35.374 --> 20:37.775
Go to her.

20:37.776 --> 20:39.544
Hey, Jeeves.

20:39.545 --> 20:43.414
Take us back to prom.
