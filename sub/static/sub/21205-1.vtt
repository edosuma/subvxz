00:42.303 --> 00:46.307
All right.
Almost done.

00:47.177 --> 00:48.483
Pickles.

00:49.310 --> 00:50.789
Here you go, boy.

00:50.833 --> 00:51.834
All right.

00:51.877 --> 00:53.116
Okay, how many
pancakes you want?

00:53.140 --> 00:54.663
- Six.
- Ten.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.795
Ten pancakes?

00:56.839 --> 00:58.536
Ten? Say two.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.973
Say "I would like
two pancakes, please."

01:01.017 --> 01:03.193
You know they always ask
for more than they can eat.

01:03.237 --> 01:04.846
- Yeah.
- Give me...

01:04.890 --> 01:06.153
All right, I'll see you guys

01:06.196 --> 01:08.024
in a couple of hours.
I love you.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.852
What do you guys want
to do this afternoon?

01:09.895 --> 01:11.419
- The park.
- The zoo.

01:11.462 --> 01:13.682
How about the beach?

01:13.725 --> 01:16.163
- The beach.
- I'm in for the beach.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.531
And what do you
want to do tonight?

01:17.555 --> 01:20.123
Tonight should be me and you

01:20.167 --> 01:22.169
and a bottle of wine.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.735
You want to go out to dinner?

01:23.779 --> 01:25.694
Mrs. Gilberts said
that she'd watch the kids.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.652
I want to stay home
with the kids.

01:27.696 --> 01:28.523
Game night.

01:28.566 --> 01:31.526
- Yes.
- Game night.

01:31.569 --> 01:33.049
Well, you're a cheap date.

01:33.093 --> 01:34.877
Hey, the wine can't be cheap.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.400
Okay.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.446
Would you like
a pancake for the road?

01:38.489 --> 01:40.187
Yes, I would like ten, please.

01:40.230 --> 01:42.798
All right.
Have a good ride.

02:34.110 --> 02:37.200
I was told my wife's
here... Kaylene Larson.

02:38.332 --> 02:39.507
There's her doctor now.

02:39.550 --> 02:41.726
Doctor, is she okay?

02:41.770 --> 02:43.424
Drew Larson, Kaylene's husband.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.383
Kaylene Larson.

02:46.427 --> 02:48.864
Let me s... Yes.
She's... She's okay.

02:48.907 --> 02:50.518
She has a concussion,

02:50.561 --> 02:52.215
a fractured leg, bruised ribs,

02:52.259 --> 02:53.912
broken finger, and road burn,

02:53.956 --> 02:57.046
but all things considering,
she's pretty lucky.

02:57.089 --> 02:58.874
Can I see her?

02:58.917 --> 03:00.005
Of course.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.703
She's in room 204.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.202
Go right down the hallway.
Last one on the left.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.314
Thank you.

03:11.887 --> 03:13.236
Hey.

03:13.280 --> 03:14.933
Hey.

03:19.851 --> 03:23.768
I guess we're not going
to the beach today?

03:23.812 --> 03:25.030
Or the zoo.

03:26.902 --> 03:28.860
Babe,

03:28.904 --> 03:31.472
they made me cut
my wedding ring off.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.257
It's okay.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.694
We'll get a new band.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.394
Are the kids okay?

03:40.437 --> 03:42.700
They're fine.
They're with Mrs. Gilberts.

03:43.832 --> 03:46.138
I don't want them
to see me like this.

03:46.182 --> 03:48.793
Are you okay?

03:51.448 --> 03:53.102
You have no idea
how scary it was

03:53.145 --> 03:54.364
getting that phone call.

03:54.408 --> 03:56.540
I'm sorry.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.847
You don't have to be sorry.

03:58.890 --> 04:00.414
Just get better.

04:01.328 --> 04:03.286
I love you.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.549
I love you, too.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.161
Sorry to interrupt.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.641
Um, that's okay.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.254
I'm going to call the airline,

04:14.297 --> 04:15.994
let them know what's happening.

04:16.038 --> 04:17.517
Okay.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.476
I should be able to get
cell phone reception

04:19.519 --> 04:20.999
somewhere in the hospital.

04:22.610 --> 04:23.959
I'll be right back.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.047
Okay.

04:30.095 --> 04:33.534
So, officially, I'm Vanessa.

04:33.577 --> 04:35.318
I'm one of your nurses.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.928
Hi.

04:36.972 --> 04:39.191
How are you feeling?

04:39.235 --> 04:40.802
I'm tired now.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.413
But I guess the doctor
says I'm lucky.

04:43.457 --> 04:45.676
You certainly are.

04:45.720 --> 04:49.463
Just try and relax.
You're in good hands.

04:52.422 --> 04:54.424
So that was your husband?

04:54.468 --> 04:55.599
He's handsome.

04:55.643 --> 04:57.297
He says he works for an airline.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.515
Is he a pilot?

05:12.834 --> 05:14.444
Mr. Larson.

05:14.488 --> 05:17.099
Detective Dawkins.
Can we talk?

05:17.142 --> 05:18.709
Yeah, of course.

05:19.928 --> 05:21.886
I spoke to your wife
earlier this morning.

05:21.930 --> 05:24.193
She has no memory
of what happened to her.

05:24.236 --> 05:27.370
Why did you talk to my wife
before speaking to me?

05:27.414 --> 05:29.459
Because I'm
investigating a crime

05:29.503 --> 05:31.113
and I don't need
your permission.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.159
So tell me, Mr. Larson,

05:34.203 --> 05:35.509
what were you doing this morning

05:35.552 --> 05:37.162
while your wife was out biking?

05:37.206 --> 05:38.642
I was home with the kids.

05:38.686 --> 05:41.471
What do you do
for a living, Mr. Larson?

05:41.515 --> 05:43.821
I'm a commercial airline pilot.

05:43.865 --> 05:46.868
So you're away from home
several days at a time.

05:46.911 --> 05:47.956
That's right.

05:47.999 --> 05:49.523
Put up in one of those
nice hotels

05:49.566 --> 05:51.394
with all the pretty
flight attendants.

05:51.438 --> 05:53.353
I don't know
where this is going,

05:53.396 --> 05:56.921
but I'm 100% faithful
to my wife.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.532
Your wife have any enemies?

05:58.575 --> 06:00.403
Enemies?

06:00.447 --> 06:01.926
No.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.451
What does she do?

06:04.494 --> 06:06.496
She does marketing
for a nonprofit...

06:06.540 --> 06:08.846
Wounded Warriors.
Everybody loves her there.

06:08.890 --> 06:12.633
D-Do you really think
this was deliberate?

06:12.676 --> 06:15.984
There's nobody on that
road at that time of day.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.290
Excellent visibility.

06:18.334 --> 06:20.118
Your wife is wearing
bright clothing.

06:20.162 --> 06:21.642
There's no skid marks.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.513
So no one even tried
to hit a brake

06:23.557 --> 06:24.688
before the collision.

06:24.732 --> 06:26.690
So either your wife is a target,

06:26.734 --> 06:29.476
or she's the most unlucky
person I've ever met.

06:29.519 --> 06:31.782
Well, are there any witnesses?

06:31.826 --> 06:35.177
Did somebody
get a plate number or...

06:35.220 --> 06:38.223
Nobody that we've been
able to find so far.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.661
We don't even know how long
she was lying there unconscious

06:40.704 --> 06:42.010
before the joggers found her.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.273
Look, I can't think
of a single person

06:44.316 --> 06:45.492
that would want to hurt her.

06:45.535 --> 06:46.754
- No one?
- No one.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.190
No one at the job,

06:48.233 --> 06:51.628
family conflict, some neighbor?

06:51.672 --> 06:53.717
No. Not anybody.

06:56.720 --> 06:59.331
Would you do me a favor,
Mr. Larson?

06:59.375 --> 07:00.681
If you think of something,

07:00.724 --> 07:02.223
no matter how
insignificant it may seem,

07:02.247 --> 07:03.423
give me a call.

07:08.036 --> 07:09.646
Thank you, detective.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.221
They all miss you so much.

07:19.264 --> 07:21.136
I think even Pickles
is depressed

07:21.179 --> 07:23.355
that you're not around.

07:23.399 --> 07:25.445
Baby, get me some Jell-O.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.837
Absolutely.

07:26.881 --> 07:29.100
Your appetite's back.
That's good.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.406
Sounds so good.

07:32.408 --> 07:35.455
Well, somebody is loved.

07:37.326 --> 07:41.286
So cute.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.853
How many kids do you have?

07:42.897 --> 07:46.074
We have twins... Zoey and Toby.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.469
That's got to be so much fun...

07:49.512 --> 07:51.949
Fun-slash-exhausting.

07:51.993 --> 07:54.299
You must have some kids, too.

07:54.343 --> 07:56.476
Kids? No.

07:57.955 --> 07:59.043
You married?

08:00.915 --> 08:05.528
My husband was killed
in action in Afghanistan.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.618
My gosh.

08:08.662 --> 08:09.793
I'm so sorry.

08:09.837 --> 08:12.535
No. I'm... I'm sorry.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.319
I... I shouldn't
have told you that.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.843
Sometimes it's just easier

08:15.886 --> 08:17.932
to talk to strangers
about things, so...

08:17.975 --> 08:20.021
I hope you won't
consider me a stranger

08:20.064 --> 08:21.065
for much longer.

08:21.109 --> 08:22.719
It's hard to consider
you a stranger

08:22.763 --> 08:24.547
when you've seen me
with this gown off.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.768
You know, it's all
part of my job.

08:27.811 --> 08:29.378
Hey, check it out.

08:29.421 --> 08:33.034
Strawberry, lime, orange,
and black cherry.

08:33.077 --> 08:34.861
Four different flavors of gross.

08:34.905 --> 08:37.559
You should be able to start
eating real food soon.

08:37.604 --> 08:39.388
Any numbness or tingling

08:39.431 --> 08:41.129
in your toes or fingertips?

08:41.172 --> 08:42.217
No.

08:42.260 --> 08:43.697
Good. All right.

08:43.740 --> 08:45.133
I'll be by to check
on you later.

08:45.176 --> 08:46.308
All right.

08:50.094 --> 08:52.096
Hey, have you guys thought about

08:52.140 --> 08:54.055
what you're going
to do for home care?

08:54.098 --> 08:56.710
I was going to go
to Discharge Planning

08:56.753 --> 08:59.147
to find out about
a home health aide.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.105
Can I be honest?

09:01.149 --> 09:02.106
- What?
- Yeah.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.194
I wouldn't.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.762
Well, the doctor
was just saying that...

09:05.806 --> 09:07.206
- That you'll need somebody.
- Yeah.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.330
He's right.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.375
But what I'm saying is,

09:10.419 --> 09:12.421
with your situation,

09:15.032 --> 09:16.730
Look, can I be honest with you?

09:16.773 --> 09:17.774
- Please.
- Sure.

09:17.818 --> 09:18.993
Do you know how long it takes

09:19.036 --> 09:20.777
to become a home health aide?

09:23.650 --> 09:25.129
It's a six-week course.

09:25.173 --> 09:27.175
- They teach them how to...
- Wow.

09:27.218 --> 09:30.831
Take blood pressure
and wipe a tush. Done.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.833
You know, with young kids,

09:32.876 --> 09:35.662
and especially how serious
your injuries are,

09:35.705 --> 09:37.577
I'd get a nurse.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.969
Babe.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.366
Well, can you recommend a nurse?

09:47.717 --> 09:49.197
What, you?

09:49.240 --> 09:50.677
If you'll have me.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.200
Wait. Can you do that

09:52.243 --> 09:53.743
while you're working here
at the hospital?

09:53.767 --> 09:55.072
I'm only registry,

09:55.116 --> 09:56.552
so I can come and go
as I please.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.510
I'm just covering for someone

09:58.554 --> 09:59.642
on maternity leave.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.818
And you want the job?

10:05.605 --> 10:08.259
- What do you think?
- I think we have a nurse.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.739
Thank you.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.349
Yeah. Okay.

10:11.393 --> 10:14.657
Great. All right.
Well, we'll be in touch.

10:14.701 --> 10:16.311
Enjoy your Jell-O.

10:18.966 --> 10:21.142
This is the kitchen, obviously.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.449
The pool and the living room.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.277
It's a beautiful home.

10:26.321 --> 10:27.322
Thank you.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.454
Toby, Zoey, come here.

10:29.498 --> 10:32.457
- Daddy.
- Hey, guys.

10:32.501 --> 10:33.894
Guys.

10:37.767 --> 10:41.205
And this is your mother's
nurse Vanessa.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.644
We talked about this, right?

10:44.687 --> 10:46.428
She's going to be
staying with us

10:46.471 --> 10:48.299
until Mommy feels better.

10:48.343 --> 10:50.606
Hi. I'm Zoey, and this
is my brother Toby.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.173
Hi.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.828
It is very nice
to meet you both.

10:54.871 --> 10:56.960
And these two promised me

10:57.004 --> 10:59.963
that they would be
on their best behavior

11:00.007 --> 11:02.705
while you're here. Right?

11:02.749 --> 11:04.272
And then we each get a toy.

11:04.315 --> 11:06.578
Only if you're good.

11:06.622 --> 11:08.145
How long are you
going to be here?

11:08.189 --> 11:10.844
I mean, don't
take that the wrong way.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.236
They're just trying to calculate

11:12.280 --> 11:15.544
how many days of good
behavior are ahead of them.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.198
They're smart?

11:17.241 --> 11:22.507
I guess, but do not trust
these innocent faces.

11:22.551 --> 11:26.947
These two are shrewd
operators working the system.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.819
All right, guys, who wants
to show Vanessa to her room?

11:29.863 --> 11:31.908
I will. Come on, Vanessa.

11:31.952 --> 11:34.432
We even clipped a flower
from Mommy's garden

11:34.476 --> 11:35.738
and put it in your room.

11:35.782 --> 11:39.089
That is very sweet of you.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.831
- Thank you.
- Here, I'll take that.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.443
Toby, I thought we talked

11:45.487 --> 11:47.619
about you leaving
your toys on the floor.

11:47.663 --> 11:48.838
Sorry.

11:48.882 --> 11:50.971
That's okay. Come on.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.541
I hope the kids
don't bother you too much.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.500
They have a lot of energy.

11:58.543 --> 12:00.763
It's good, though.
They hang out next door

12:00.807 --> 12:02.852
at Mrs. Gilberts' house.
She's so sweet.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.767
She takes care of them
when I'm working,

12:04.811 --> 12:06.900
and I feel like
there's other things

12:06.943 --> 12:09.424
I should be telling you,
maybe, about the house.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.599
The thermostat...

12:10.642 --> 12:13.994
Kaylene, I'll figure it out.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.996
- Okay.
- More importantly,

12:16.039 --> 12:17.171
how are you feeling?

12:17.214 --> 12:18.999
You ready for your medication?

12:21.001 --> 12:22.959
- Yeah, I guess.
- Good.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.748
And you just need to be patient.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.227
Healing takes time,

12:30.271 --> 12:33.578
and your body needs to rest.

12:35.058 --> 12:36.364
These will help with the pain,

12:36.407 --> 12:37.844
but they'll also help you sleep.

12:37.887 --> 12:39.149
Okay.

12:41.238 --> 12:42.370
All these?

12:51.683 --> 12:53.120
Can you grab the kids for me

12:53.163 --> 12:55.035
so that I can hang out
with them a little bit

12:55.078 --> 12:57.254
- before I fall asleep?
- Of course.

13:12.313 --> 13:15.272
Hey, is she okay enough
to read to the kids?

13:15.316 --> 13:18.319
She is officially
out like a light.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.881
You are such a bad girl.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.622
It's hard to concentrate.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.580
You're doing great.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.409
Is that her?

14:05.453 --> 14:07.629
Well, if that's you,
then that's her.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.065
Let me see.

14:13.765 --> 14:16.029
I could get so fired for this.

14:17.900 --> 14:21.817
Ooh, you've been
such a good boy.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.038
Now it's my turn
to take care of you.

14:27.431 --> 14:31.218
You just keep your eyes
on the screen...

14:31.261 --> 14:33.481
and I'll take care of the rest.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.265
Close your eyes.

14:36.310 --> 14:39.095
Yes. Take control.

14:39.139 --> 14:40.705
I'm down for that.

15:22.051 --> 15:25.446
You look like you
could use this.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.928
Yes. Thank you.

15:28.971 --> 15:31.800
It was not a good night.

15:31.843 --> 15:33.062
What happened?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.760
She just...

15:35.804 --> 15:37.327
She couldn't get comfortable.

15:37.371 --> 15:40.374
Just tossing and turning.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.724
She elbowed me in the face.

15:43.986 --> 15:45.379
Well, I'll see

15:45.422 --> 15:47.163
if we can up her meds a bit.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.339
In the meantime,

15:49.383 --> 15:51.124
why don't you stay
in the extra guest room?

15:51.167 --> 15:52.777
You know, just until
she gets back

15:52.821 --> 15:54.475
to her regular sleeping pattern.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.651
I don't think she'd
be happy with that.

15:57.826 --> 15:58.958
Maybe not,

15:59.001 --> 16:00.394
but I don't think
your passengers

16:00.437 --> 16:03.527
would like a pilot falling
asleep in the cockpit.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.355
You're probably right
about that.

16:06.443 --> 16:07.879
No, honestly,

16:07.923 --> 16:09.533
it would be easier for me

16:09.577 --> 16:10.708
to tend to Kaylene

16:10.752 --> 16:13.102
at all hours of the day
and the night

16:13.146 --> 16:15.409
if she were in her own room.

16:15.452 --> 16:17.411
Well, if you can
convince her of it,

16:17.454 --> 16:18.760
I am all for it.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.980
- Can't get me.
- Gonna get ya.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.807
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Wait!

16:22.851 --> 16:24.287
Why aren't you guys dressed?

16:24.331 --> 16:25.873
Miss Thompson's coming over
to take you to school.

16:25.897 --> 16:27.464
There's no school today.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.554
I cut you some apples.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.296
Parent-teacher conferences.

16:33.340 --> 16:37.561
All right.
I will call Mrs. Gilberts

16:37.605 --> 16:39.085
and see if she
can come over and...

16:39.128 --> 16:41.609
Don't bother. I got it.

16:41.652 --> 16:44.264
No. You got your hands
full with Kaylene.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.222
I'm happy to take care of them.

16:47.441 --> 16:49.356
- You sure?
- Absolutely.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.923
Thank you so much.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.057
When's Mommy coming out?

16:55.101 --> 16:57.059
Your mommy just needs
to stay in bed

16:57.103 --> 16:58.756
for a few more days, sweetie.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.019
But I want to see her.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.890
Me, too.

17:01.933 --> 17:04.284
Mommy needs to get her rest
for a few more days.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.721
We'll go and see her
later, okay?

17:06.763 --> 17:08.417
God, I got to go.

17:08.462 --> 17:10.377
They will pick out
their own clothes

17:10.420 --> 17:12.248
and tell you
what they want to eat.

17:12.291 --> 17:14.642
Um, one hour of TV max.

17:14.685 --> 17:15.730
They can feed the dog,

17:15.772 --> 17:17.252
but just make sure
they close the gate

17:17.297 --> 17:18.776
so the dog doesn't get out.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.517
Bedtime is at 8:00 sharp,

17:20.560 --> 17:23.303
and do not let them
convince you otherwise.

17:23.346 --> 17:25.608
We got it under control,
right, guys?

17:25.653 --> 17:27.089
- Right.
- Right.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.960
Thank you so much.

17:29.004 --> 17:30.962
I will see you guys
tomorrow afternoon.

17:31.006 --> 17:33.356
Mwah! Mwah!
I love you. Bye.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.401
Bye.

17:36.316 --> 17:40.146
Well, kiddos, looks like
it's just the three of us.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.591
How much longer?

17:50.634 --> 17:52.897
Let's see.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.986
Seven more minutes.

17:55.030 --> 17:56.510
Aw.

17:58.077 --> 18:01.167
You two are just like me.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.605
I can't wait
for cookies, either.

18:05.693 --> 18:07.521
Do you want to see
what they look like?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.218
Yeah.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.443
Don't they look delicious?

18:16.486 --> 18:18.184
Yeah.

18:36.637 --> 18:37.594
I'll get it.

18:37.638 --> 18:39.553
Nobody touches that oven.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.170
Can I help you?

18:49.476 --> 18:50.651
Hi.

18:50.694 --> 18:51.956
I'm Samantha.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.480
I'm here to see Kaylene.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.830
It's not really a good time.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.136
She's sleeping right now.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.485
Hi, Auntie Samantha.

18:58.528 --> 19:02.793
Hi, guys. Come here.
Ha ha ha ha!

19:02.837 --> 19:04.621
Get over here!!

19:06.841 --> 19:08.190
This is Mommy's nurse.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.279
And we're baking
peanut butter cookies.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.369
Really?
Well, I had no idea

19:13.413 --> 19:15.197
it was in a nurse's
job description

19:15.241 --> 19:16.242
to bake cookies.

19:16.285 --> 19:18.418
Just helping out wherever I can.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.552
Well, I am gonna go
see your mommy,

19:22.596 --> 19:24.574
and then I will come back
and hang out with you guys.

19:24.598 --> 19:26.948
I promise, promise,
promise, okay?

19:26.991 --> 19:28.428
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:33.302 --> 19:35.043
Knock-knock.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.654
You okay? Are you asleep?

19:37.698 --> 19:41.136
Whoa. What is
going on around here?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.965
This is... okay.

19:47.273 --> 19:48.578
That's too bright.

19:48.622 --> 19:51.233
Okay. Don't take this
the wrong way,

19:51.277 --> 19:54.193
but you kind of look like hell.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.848
I was in an accident.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.241
Yeah. I know.

19:59.285 --> 20:00.436
I was at the hospital with you

20:00.460 --> 20:02.462
every single day, remember?

20:03.898 --> 20:05.378
Yeah.

20:05.421 --> 20:07.597
That was sweet of you.

20:07.641 --> 20:08.816
Thank you.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.993
I think I'm a little out of it.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.036
Yeah. I know.

20:14.125 --> 20:15.126
What's this?

20:15.170 --> 20:16.954
That's the guy.

20:16.998 --> 20:19.435
I'm supposed to call him
if I remember anything.

20:19.479 --> 20:21.089
I don't remember anything.

20:21.132 --> 20:24.875
Of course you don't,
not in this condition.

20:26.616 --> 20:28.139
How many pills are you taking?

20:28.183 --> 20:29.663
All those.

20:29.706 --> 20:30.751
Yeah?

20:30.794 --> 20:34.102
I'm just gonna take
a little nap for...

20:34.145 --> 20:35.756
A quick nap.

20:42.893 --> 20:43.851
Okay.

20:43.894 --> 20:44.939
Come on.

20:44.982 --> 20:46.245
I'm gonna help you.

20:49.900 --> 20:51.075
Okay?

20:51.119 --> 20:52.251
Yeah.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.904
Okay, real slow.

20:53.948 --> 20:55.166
Yeah.

20:56.211 --> 20:57.865
I'm sorry.

20:57.908 --> 21:00.389
That is so brutal.

21:00.433 --> 21:02.565
So what's up across the hall?

21:02.609 --> 21:04.524
Is that where she's sleeping?

21:04.567 --> 21:07.222
No, that's where Drew's
sleeping for a little bit.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.050
What? Why?

21:09.093 --> 21:10.573
He's just, you know...

21:10.617 --> 21:13.228
He said I'm not that easy
to sleep next to.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.447
Look, you know what?

21:14.490 --> 21:15.815
You are going to feel
so much better

21:15.839 --> 21:17.319
after a bath, I promise you.

21:17.363 --> 21:18.538
Just forget it.

21:20.453 --> 21:23.238
This is the first time
that I didn't feel like crap

21:23.282 --> 21:24.718
in a very long time.

21:24.761 --> 21:26.502
Aw.

21:27.982 --> 21:31.638
So how much do you know
about this woman?

21:31.681 --> 21:33.770
- Vanessa?
- Yeah.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.034
She was my favorite nurse
in the hospital.

21:37.078 --> 21:38.862
She's so attentive.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.734
Okay, but what about her family?

21:40.777 --> 21:43.214
I mean, how could she
just drop everything

21:43.258 --> 21:44.694
and move in like this?

21:44.738 --> 21:46.827
I don't think
she has any family.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.395
Her husband died in Afghanistan.

21:49.438 --> 21:50.961
Whoa.

21:51.005 --> 21:52.441
It's awful.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.443
You know what? I'm gonna
take some time off work,

21:54.487 --> 21:56.445
and I'm gonna help out
around here.

21:56.489 --> 21:58.665
No, you're not.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.581
You have that whole big
venture capital thingie.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.931
That venture capital thingie
is done on Wednesday,

22:03.974 --> 22:04.845
so yes, I can help.

22:04.888 --> 22:07.369
No, you're not coming over here

22:07.413 --> 22:09.153
and helping with stuff,
you weirdo.

22:09.197 --> 22:11.199
I don't like Vanessa down there

22:11.242 --> 22:13.027
baking cookies
with Toby and Zoey.

22:13.070 --> 22:14.507
She's so good with the kids.

22:14.550 --> 22:16.944
I feel horrible I can't
hang out with them right now,

22:16.987 --> 22:18.946
and Drew can't take
any more time off work.

22:18.989 --> 22:22.384
Okay, well, how long
is she going to be here?

22:22.428 --> 22:23.603
I don't know.

22:23.646 --> 22:25.387
Maybe a couple weeks.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.128
More importantly...

22:27.171 --> 22:31.480
when are we going to
bedazzle that cast?

22:31.524 --> 22:33.743
No. Don't say bedazzle.

22:41.098 --> 22:42.491
Vanessa, is it?

22:42.535 --> 22:44.624
If you wouldn't mind
washing her hair

22:44.667 --> 22:45.973
just a little more often.

22:46.016 --> 22:47.670
It's hard to start
feeling better

22:47.714 --> 22:49.324
when you look that terrible.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.935
Okay.

22:51.979 --> 22:52.936
Thanks.

22:52.980 --> 22:55.199
Samantha, is it?

22:55.243 --> 22:58.594
Kaylene needs time
to rest and heal,

22:58.638 --> 23:01.423
and no amount of soap or make-up

23:01.467 --> 23:03.425
is going to speed that along.

23:05.166 --> 23:06.515
And keeping her so doped up

23:06.559 --> 23:08.082
that she can't carry on
a conversation?

23:08.125 --> 23:11.041
Is that also part
of your healing process?

23:12.216 --> 23:14.480
It's called pain management.

23:14.523 --> 23:16.046
Would you rather she suffered?

23:16.090 --> 23:19.833
Hey, Auntie Samantha, want
to try one of our cookies?

23:21.312 --> 23:23.358
Honey, I would love to,

23:23.402 --> 23:26.013
but you know
I'm allergic to peanuts.

23:26.883 --> 23:29.408
This looks so delicious.

23:29.451 --> 23:32.454
You know what?
I am going to color.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.456
Okay.

23:34.500 --> 23:38.504
What should I draw?

23:38.547 --> 23:40.636
What are you guys making?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.595
That's me, that's Toby,
that's Daddy,

23:42.638 --> 23:44.684
and that's Vanessa and Pickles.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.555
Where's your mommy?

23:46.599 --> 23:48.731
Right here in bed.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.038
That makes me really sad

23:51.081 --> 23:53.606
that she's way down
in the corner like that.

23:53.649 --> 23:55.564
Vanessa told us
we need to keep quiet

23:55.608 --> 23:57.044
so we can let her sleep.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.263
Really?

24:03.267 --> 24:04.443
You know what?

24:04.486 --> 24:05.618
It's absolutely true.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.576
She does need to rest.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.100
But do you know what
the best medicine is?

24:10.144 --> 24:13.495
All of the hugs and kisses
you can give her.

24:13.539 --> 24:16.237
- Really?
- Ha ha ha ha!

24:16.280 --> 24:19.022
Well, not exactly.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.548
Are you seriously telling me

24:22.591 --> 24:24.941
that these children can't
spend time with their mother?

24:24.985 --> 24:26.465
Not at all.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.728
But I have been hired

24:28.771 --> 24:30.773
to nurse Kaylene back to health,

24:30.817 --> 24:32.949
which means ensuring

24:32.993 --> 24:37.780
that she gets plenty
of uninterrupted rest.

24:37.824 --> 24:39.565
I forgot something
in the bedroom.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.218
I will be right back.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.703
What have we got here?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.576
Kaylene, we really need to...

25:23.739 --> 25:27.047
A cookie hamburger.
What would be in it?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.265
Icing?

25:32.443 --> 25:34.358
Hey, guys, I got to go,

25:34.402 --> 25:36.249
and I really want to give
you kisses like always,

25:36.273 --> 25:38.113
but I can't because of
that darn peanut butter.

25:38.145 --> 25:40.321
So I am going
to blow you kisses.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.410
Mwah and mwah.

25:42.453 --> 25:43.759
And maybe this weekend

25:43.803 --> 25:45.326
I will take you somewhere fun.

25:45.369 --> 25:46.936
Yay.

25:46.980 --> 25:47.980
Bye.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.337
Please call first next time.

25:56.380 --> 25:57.773
Actually, Vanessa,

25:57.817 --> 25:59.470
I'll drop by whenever I want

25:59.514 --> 26:00.863
because this ain't your house,

26:00.907 --> 26:02.996
and this isn't your family.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.826
Have a nice day.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.003
Bitch.

26:12.962 --> 26:16.662
"Then the fox said
to the little mouse,

26:16.705 --> 26:19.447
'I know a short cut
through the groove'."

26:19.490 --> 26:20.622
Grove.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.078
Grove. "Follow me
through the grove."

26:22.102 --> 26:23.930
Right. Sorry.

26:23.973 --> 26:26.585
"'Follow me, and I will
show you to my pen'."

26:26.628 --> 26:27.629
- Den.
- Den.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.065
- Mom.
- Sorry, sweetie.

26:29.109 --> 26:31.067
It's a little bit blurry
for me right now.

26:31.111 --> 26:33.243
Vanessa doesn't
make any mistakes

26:33.287 --> 26:34.680
when she reads to us.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.725
Yeah, and she makes
funny animal noises

26:36.769 --> 26:38.248
to all the animals, too.

26:38.292 --> 26:40.686
I'm sorry, you guys.

26:40.729 --> 26:43.776
You know what?
I'm going to try it again.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.126
Okay? Ready?
"Then the fox said"...

26:46.169 --> 26:47.867
Hey, you two,

26:47.910 --> 26:49.999
let's let your mom
get some sleep now.

26:50.043 --> 26:52.436
I'll finish reading
to you in your room.

26:52.480 --> 26:54.090
- Yay.
- Aw.

26:54.134 --> 26:56.179
Okay. Hugs.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.051
Kisses.

26:59.835 --> 27:02.098
Here, let me give you your meds.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.145
Roxie And the Fox.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.451
- Yeah.
- That's their favorite.

27:07.495 --> 27:08.714
Here you go.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.633
The more you rest,

27:14.676 --> 27:16.635
the faster you'll recover.

27:19.159 --> 27:20.160
Okay.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.163
Here, I got this.

27:25.905 --> 27:29.125
Let's make this
a little darker for you.

27:29.169 --> 27:31.998
Okay, let's go, Pickles.
Come on.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.394
Sweet dreams.

27:59.765 --> 28:00.853
Hey.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.463
What are you doing out of bed?

28:02.506 --> 28:03.943
I just thought it might be good,

28:03.986 --> 28:06.075
you know, if I was up
and around a little bit.

28:06.119 --> 28:08.643
Well, I don't know
if that's the best idea.

28:10.645 --> 28:13.387
I think I just miss the kids.

28:13.430 --> 28:15.041
I know.

28:15.084 --> 28:16.607
But I... I really think

28:16.651 --> 28:18.305
that you'd be better off in bed.

28:19.654 --> 28:20.916
God, I've just been in bed

28:20.960 --> 28:22.265
for so many days.

28:22.309 --> 28:24.615
I think I'm going stir crazy.

28:24.659 --> 28:26.879
Hey, guys.

28:26.922 --> 28:28.750
Do you want to put
your bathing suits on?

28:28.794 --> 28:29.969
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

28:30.012 --> 28:31.187
Yes.

28:34.364 --> 28:35.539
I'll just sit outside

28:35.583 --> 28:37.019
and watch them for a while.

28:37.063 --> 28:38.780
Okay. Well, I guess
I'll put my suit on, too.

28:38.804 --> 28:40.719
Perfect.
You brought one.

28:40.762 --> 28:42.068
You know, I'm like a Boy Scout.

28:42.111 --> 28:43.765
I always come prepared.

28:52.905 --> 28:55.995
They always play so well
together.

28:56.038 --> 28:58.432
Usually, until Toby gets tired

28:58.475 --> 29:00.913
of Zoey telling him what to do.

29:00.956 --> 29:03.785
So she calls the shots.

29:03.829 --> 29:05.589
She was born two minutes
earlier than he was,

29:05.613 --> 29:08.703
so, you know,
she's much older and wiser,

29:08.747 --> 29:09.878
according to her.

29:10.966 --> 29:13.012
How was your pregnancy?

29:13.055 --> 29:15.405
It was fantastic.

29:15.449 --> 29:17.756
Every single thing

29:17.799 --> 29:20.497
that I smelled made me
wanna throw up.

29:20.541 --> 29:23.196
And I had enormous canckles.

29:23.239 --> 29:27.026
It was super hot.
It was worth it.

29:30.899 --> 29:34.816
- You're lucky.
- I know.

29:34.860 --> 29:37.601
We did try for a long time.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.778
They are miracles.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.781
IVF?

29:46.610 --> 29:47.568
Yeah.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.917
I just assumed

29:48.961 --> 29:51.137
when you said
you'd tried for years.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.879
Plus the fact
that you had twins.

29:53.922 --> 29:55.576
Yeah.

29:55.619 --> 29:58.100
We tried everything.
I mean everything.

29:58.144 --> 30:01.800
I became like
a human pincushion.

30:01.843 --> 30:04.411
Actually, it's... it's true.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.171
Every time I see someone
with twins these days,

30:06.195 --> 30:08.807
I always just wanna ask them
who did their in vitro.

30:11.853 --> 30:13.463
Do you think you'll have more?

30:13.507 --> 30:17.380
No.

30:17.424 --> 30:20.122
We're so happy,
just the four of us.

30:20.166 --> 30:22.124
It's really perfect.

30:26.607 --> 30:28.696
Hey, guys! I'm home!

30:31.568 --> 30:33.570
Toby? Zoey?

30:35.703 --> 30:38.053
Kay?

30:41.883 --> 30:43.145
Kay?

31:21.531 --> 31:23.794
I think it's time
for your needs.

31:23.838 --> 31:26.058
You ready to to back in?

31:26.972 --> 31:30.236
I don't think so.

31:30.279 --> 31:33.195
Feels really good to be outside.

31:33.239 --> 31:38.026
Kaylene, in order for your
meds to be most effective.

31:38.070 --> 31:41.116
We need to keep you
on a regular schedule.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.945
Well, the good news is

31:43.989 --> 31:47.079
I'm not in that
much pain right now.

31:47.122 --> 31:48.515
I don't want to get addicted.

31:48.558 --> 31:51.779
Are you saying you know
better than your doctor?

31:51.822 --> 31:54.173
No.

31:54.216 --> 31:56.740
But I know how I feel.

31:56.784 --> 32:00.353
You know, there's
this old rule in nursing,

32:00.396 --> 32:03.704
especially with injuries
like yours.

32:03.747 --> 32:07.882
Stay ahead of the pain.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.144
The one thing we don't want

32:09.188 --> 32:10.972
is to wait until
you're already in pain,

32:11.016 --> 32:12.104
before you take them,

32:12.147 --> 32:14.584
because by that time,

32:14.628 --> 32:16.978
it's too late.

32:17.022 --> 32:19.589
That makes sense.
Okay.

32:19.633 --> 32:21.548
Good.

32:23.767 --> 32:26.727
- We're gonna get you better.
- Thank you.

32:30.078 --> 32:32.428
And fentanyl.

32:32.472 --> 32:34.691
Dilaudid?
You can't even get dilaudid.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.607
This is way too much medication
for one person, right?

32:37.651 --> 32:40.915
This is too much medication
for an entire platoon.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.352
Okay, jokester, not funny.

32:43.396 --> 32:46.007
No, you're right.
I'm sorry.

32:46.051 --> 32:47.922
But I want to tell you
something else.

32:47.966 --> 32:49.619
I mean, aside from her taking

32:49.663 --> 32:51.708
three different types
of opioids,

32:51.752 --> 32:56.452
which... I don't even know
how that happens, okay?

32:56.496 --> 32:57.758
Yeah.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.281
And benzos?

32:59.325 --> 33:01.544
I mean, Samantha,
have you seen the models?

33:01.588 --> 33:04.895
She has three different
prescribers

33:04.939 --> 33:06.636
and three different pharmacists.

33:06.680 --> 33:10.249
Which I'm assuming
should not be happening.

33:10.292 --> 33:13.295
Well, it's illegal.
There's that.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.036
But I would never
prescribe her this.

33:16.777 --> 33:20.172
Okay, so what should she do?

33:20.215 --> 33:22.043
How sedated did she look?

33:22.087 --> 33:24.176
She can barely carry on
a conversation.

33:24.219 --> 33:26.482
And she's sleeping half the day.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.355
Well, then she needs to see
another doctor immediately.

33:29.398 --> 33:31.835
And she needs to take
the meds with her.

33:33.576 --> 33:38.190
And, look, if you'd like,
I will see her.

33:38.233 --> 33:40.844
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:40.888 --> 33:43.108
That would be amazing.

33:43.151 --> 33:44.326
Listen.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.286
Here's my card.

33:47.329 --> 33:48.765
Make sure she uses it.

33:48.809 --> 33:51.551
And if she has any problem
with appointments,

33:51.594 --> 33:53.770
make sure she calls
my cell phone.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.861
So, seriously,

33:57.905 --> 34:00.777
are you just doing this 'cause
you wanna do the right thing,

34:00.821 --> 34:04.738
or 'cause you just
wanna get back in my,

34:04.781 --> 34:06.653
you know, life?

34:09.395 --> 34:11.614
Why, is this mutually exclusive?

34:11.658 --> 34:15.139
In my case, usually.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.446
Well, I could charge you
for the session,

34:17.489 --> 34:19.840
if that would make you
feel better.

34:19.882 --> 34:21.188
No, I'm good.

34:21.233 --> 34:22.451
- You sure?
- Yeah.

34:22.495 --> 34:23.688
I'll buy you a coffee, though.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.760
Maybe I'll pay.

34:35.943 --> 34:40.339
Wow! There is some serious
cooking going on in here.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.210
You know it.

34:46.214 --> 34:48.737
You know what?

34:48.782 --> 34:51.350
This is...

34:51.393 --> 34:53.221
officially outstanding.

34:53.264 --> 34:54.440
Here. Try some.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.184
Wow. That really is good.

35:00.576 --> 35:02.100
But you know what it needs?

35:02.143 --> 35:03.362
What?

35:03.405 --> 35:05.494
A couple glasses of wine.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.150
You know what, I could use one.

35:10.934 --> 35:12.675
Or ten.

35:14.851 --> 35:17.550
It has been a long week.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.774
- Voilà.
- Wow. It smells good.

35:25.862 --> 35:29.431
You a nurse or a chef?

35:29.475 --> 35:32.565
Thanks. We make a good team.

35:32.608 --> 35:35.742
Team like you cook, I eat?

35:35.785 --> 35:37.526
Just the way I like it.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.185
Okay.

35:44.229 --> 35:46.796
You ready for dinner?

35:46.840 --> 35:50.626
Actually, I'm gonna take a plate
to Kaylene before we sit down.

35:50.670 --> 35:53.934
You know what?
I just checked on her.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.283
She's out cold.

35:55.327 --> 35:57.329
God, she's just
sleeping so much.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.808
I know.

35:58.852 --> 36:00.201
It's like one minute she's fine,

36:00.245 --> 36:01.637
and then the next...

36:04.205 --> 36:07.600
Can I give you some advice?

36:07.643 --> 36:10.690
Tonight, give yourself a break.

36:10.733 --> 36:12.822
She'll be fine.

36:12.866 --> 36:14.824
But you need to relax

36:14.868 --> 36:17.871
and just not think
about anything.

36:17.914 --> 36:19.177
That's an order.

36:20.352 --> 36:22.789
Tomorrow is another day,
but tonight...

36:22.832 --> 36:24.399
well, just enjoy.

36:30.710 --> 36:33.626
You know, I saw you staring
at me at the pool today.

36:33.669 --> 36:36.542
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:36.585 --> 36:38.108
You don't have to pretend.

36:38.152 --> 36:41.590
- Zoey, Toby!
- I liked it.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.244
It's, time for dinner.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.551
Hey, guys!

36:45.594 --> 36:48.554
Your daddy and I made
a huge pot of spaghetti!

36:48.597 --> 36:51.600
- Yay!
- Yeah, let's eat!

37:00.827 --> 37:03.656
He says you're taking
way too many pills.

37:03.699 --> 37:06.136
Well, if that's true,
then why were they prescribed?

37:06.180 --> 37:08.138
By three different doctors.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.444
He says you were overmedicated,

37:09.488 --> 37:12.273
and he will make time
to see you.

37:12.317 --> 37:14.797
Do you feel a little bit loopy?

37:14.841 --> 37:16.277
Girl, I love you,

37:16.321 --> 37:19.062
but you are a lot loopy.

37:19.106 --> 37:21.630
I love you, too.

37:21.674 --> 37:23.676
And it's true,
I haven't been paying attention

37:23.719 --> 37:26.200
to what she's been giving me,
because she's a nurse, right?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.680
She's a really good nurse.

37:27.723 --> 37:30.291
Well, that is yet
to be established.

37:30.335 --> 37:34.991
Why don't you go see Max?

37:35.035 --> 37:39.126
All right,
I'll just check his schedule.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.041
Blah, blah, blah.
Call him.

37:41.084 --> 37:42.869
You're so bossy,

37:42.912 --> 37:46.699
- All right, I'll call him.
- Thank you.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.527
Okay, after that happens,

37:48.570 --> 37:51.138
you need to plan a weekend
alone with your family.

37:51.181 --> 37:52.768
Tell Vanessa to take
a hike for a few days.

37:52.792 --> 37:54.663
Yes, sir.

37:56.361 --> 38:00.365
- The whole weekend?
- Yes, Drew's off work.

38:00.408 --> 38:04.847
So he's gonna be able
to take care of me.

38:04.891 --> 38:06.980
I don't know
if that's such a good idea.

38:11.027 --> 38:13.943
We'll be fine, I promise.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.858
Well, don't you have
friends or family

38:15.902 --> 38:18.992
that you'd be excited
to check in with?

38:19.035 --> 38:20.428
I'm sure.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.604
I guess I could get caught up
on a few things.

38:22.648 --> 38:24.084
Perfect.

38:26.216 --> 38:28.654
Is everything okay?

38:28.697 --> 38:31.352
Are you unhappy
with the job I'm doing?

38:31.396 --> 38:32.788
No, of course not.

38:32.832 --> 38:34.964
We just want to spend
the time alone together

38:35.008 --> 38:36.792
as a family.

38:39.012 --> 38:41.144
I think I'm done.

38:41.188 --> 38:42.842
So that was really good.

38:44.713 --> 38:48.195
My leg feels way better.

38:48.238 --> 38:49.675
She said as she limped away,

38:49.718 --> 38:52.025
pretending not to be in pain.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.683
I'll be back in a couple
of days, okay?

38:57.726 --> 39:01.208
- Okay.
- Bye, Vanessa.

39:01.251 --> 39:04.385
I'm gonna miss you both so much.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.998
Now, try not
to tire out your mom.

39:09.042 --> 39:10.739
She still needs
a lot of rest, okay?

39:10.783 --> 39:13.307
- Pickles!
- She's always resting.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.092
Pickles!
Has anybody seen Pickles?

39:16.136 --> 39:18.268
I can't seem to find him.

39:18.312 --> 39:19.531
I can help you look.

39:19.574 --> 39:21.271
If you could check out back.

39:21.315 --> 39:24.231
- Sure.
- Pickles!

39:24.274 --> 39:26.407
- Pickles!
- Pickles!

39:26.451 --> 39:28.627
- Here, Pickles!
- Pickles.

39:28.670 --> 39:32.935
We can't find him anywhere.
He must have gotten out somehow.

39:32.979 --> 39:35.242
We have to find him.
The kids are gonna be devastated.

39:35.285 --> 39:39.115
They already are.
Toby and Zoey are in the kitchen crying.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.943
- They are?
- Yeah.

39:40.987 --> 39:43.206
Vanessa's in there
trying to console them.

39:43.250 --> 39:45.426
- She's still here?
- She said she would stay and help.

39:45.470 --> 39:46.775
Yeah, of course she did.

39:46.819 --> 39:50.257
Kaylene, we need all
the help we can get.

39:50.300 --> 39:53.216
I know. I'm starting to...

39:53.260 --> 39:55.393
Why don't I send them
in here with you,

39:55.436 --> 39:58.700
and then Vanessa and I will go out
in the neighborhood and look again?

39:58.744 --> 40:00.876
Yeah, send them in with me.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.840
Pickles! Pickles!

40:07.883 --> 40:09.494
Has he ever gotten out before?

40:09.537 --> 40:13.367
No. He didn't have much
common sense either,

40:13.411 --> 40:14.851
so I'm afraid
he'll get hit by a car.

40:14.890 --> 40:17.284
You said Kaylene's been
absent minded lately.

40:17.327 --> 40:20.679
Is it possible she accidentally
left the gate open?

40:20.722 --> 40:22.637
I don't know. Maybe.

40:24.683 --> 40:27.120
This does happen
with concussions.

40:27.163 --> 40:31.254
It can take a while for
the brain to get to normal.

40:33.213 --> 40:34.432
Pickles!

40:34.475 --> 40:38.174
- Pickles!
- Pickles!

40:39.611 --> 40:41.830
- Pickles!
- Pickles!

40:47.270 --> 40:50.273
Daddy! Daddy!
Did you find him yet?

40:52.537 --> 40:54.321
Hey, guys.

40:54.364 --> 40:57.542
Your daddy and I have been
looking and looking,

40:57.585 --> 40:59.718
and we haven't found him yet.

40:59.761 --> 41:03.939
But we love you both so much.

41:03.983 --> 41:06.768
And we're not gonna stop.

41:06.812 --> 41:11.120
And I'm even gonna go out
in a few minutes and look again.

41:11.164 --> 41:13.209
Okay?

41:13.253 --> 41:18.171
We are not gonna give up.
We're all in this together.

41:18.214 --> 41:19.520
Okay?

41:19.564 --> 41:21.087
As a family?

41:23.002 --> 41:24.569
Come here.

41:31.314 --> 41:34.317
Pickles.

41:34.361 --> 41:36.450
Pickles.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.149
What a stupid name.

42:14.793 --> 42:18.274
- "How now," said the little brown cow.
- There you two are.

42:18.318 --> 42:20.929
It's time for bed.

42:20.973 --> 42:22.888
They can sleep with me tonight.

42:22.931 --> 42:24.759
No, they can sleep
in their own bed.

42:24.803 --> 42:27.762
Honestly, I don't mind.

42:27.806 --> 42:30.112
And they both just
have been so sad.

42:30.156 --> 42:32.332
I think they'd
rather stay with me.

42:32.375 --> 42:35.553
All right.
Just this once.

42:35.596 --> 42:37.642
But don't make
a habit out of it.

42:39.208 --> 42:42.734
- Good night.
- Good night.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.827
I think there are worse habits.

42:51.525 --> 42:53.832
"Why don't you follow me
to the grove?"

43:37.789 --> 43:39.225
Where is she?

43:41.662 --> 43:43.229
I can take you if you want.

43:43.272 --> 43:45.318
I'll have to bring
the kids with us.

43:45.361 --> 43:48.626
- Where's Vanessa?
- She went to run an errand.

43:48.669 --> 43:51.367
It's all right. I'm sure Sam will be here.
She's never late.

43:51.411 --> 43:52.455
There's Vanessa.

44:01.421 --> 44:04.554
Isn't she just the cutest?

44:04.598 --> 44:08.950
Hey, Zoey! Toby!
Come meet your new dog.

44:12.127 --> 44:14.956
Who said anything
about a new dog?

44:15.000 --> 44:19.395
I don't think that
we're ready for a new dog.

44:19.439 --> 44:21.659
I'm so sorry I didn't check
in with you first.

44:21.702 --> 44:23.051
Just the kids were so sad.

44:23.095 --> 44:26.359
And puppies make
everything better, right?

44:27.839 --> 44:29.623
That wasn't really
your place, Vanessa.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.670
I know.
Um, please don't be mad.

44:32.713 --> 44:33.864
My heart was in the right place.

44:33.888 --> 44:37.239
So is she gonna be
our new puppy?

44:37.283 --> 44:40.025
- What are you gonna name her?
- Jellybean!

44:40.068 --> 44:43.289
Hey, guys, maybe let's
wait on naming her, okay,

44:43.332 --> 44:45.528
because we don't even know if
we're gonna be keeping the dog.

44:45.552 --> 44:48.990
- Please, Mommy?
- Please?

44:49.034 --> 44:51.732
- It's not really a great time...
- No.

44:51.776 --> 44:54.561
I mean, I guess...

44:54.604 --> 44:57.259
I could take her back to the
pound if you don't want her,

44:57.303 --> 45:00.306
but she was next on the list
to be euthanized.

45:00.349 --> 45:02.961
- What does that mean?
- It's...

45:03.004 --> 45:08.270
Um, you know what?
Let's just keep the dog for right now.

45:08.314 --> 45:10.664
There's Sam.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.361
Hey, where are you?
Yes.

45:12.405 --> 45:14.122
I'm so sorry. I thought
you were someone else.

45:14.146 --> 45:16.409
Yes, I do have
an appointment right now,

45:16.452 --> 45:18.628
but I think I'm gonna have
to reschedule.

45:18.672 --> 45:21.544
- Look! She's peeing!
- Ew!

45:21.588 --> 45:23.982
Vanessa will get that.

45:43.784 --> 45:45.525
Hey, babe.

45:45.568 --> 45:47.570
What's up?

45:47.614 --> 45:48.833
What's wrong?

45:48.876 --> 45:50.791
- What is it?
- Have a seat.

45:50.835 --> 45:52.837
No. What's wrong?
Is it the kids?

45:52.880 --> 45:55.578
Samantha was in a car accident.

45:55.622 --> 45:57.015
What? Is she okay?

45:57.058 --> 45:58.538
- I'm sorry.
- Where is she?

45:58.581 --> 46:00.801
- I wanna go see her.
- She didn't make it.

46:00.845 --> 46:01.933
What are you talking about?

46:01.976 --> 46:04.152
She ran into a tree or pole.

46:04.196 --> 46:05.980
They didn't tell me much.

46:07.242 --> 46:08.940
I'm gonna call her mother.

46:08.983 --> 46:11.029
Her mother's gonna know
exactly what's going on.

46:11.072 --> 46:13.466
I spoke to the police.

46:13.509 --> 46:15.294
I identified the body.

46:15.337 --> 46:16.817
I'm sorry.

46:20.603 --> 46:22.083
There you go, little one.

46:23.650 --> 46:25.478
No, no, no!

46:40.145 --> 46:41.668
You know how we were talking

46:41.711 --> 46:43.278
about going out of town
as a family

46:43.322 --> 46:44.889
right before
Pickles went missing?

46:44.932 --> 46:47.021
Yeah.

46:47.065 --> 46:48.849
Can we do that?

46:49.937 --> 46:51.765
Yeah. Sure.
It's a great idea.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.419
- Really?
- Yeah.

46:53.462 --> 46:54.637
Let's go to the Marina.

46:56.248 --> 46:58.859
I'll get your medication
schedule from Vanessa.

46:58.903 --> 47:01.557
No. I don't need them.

47:01.601 --> 47:03.603
- You sure?
- Yeah.

47:03.646 --> 47:06.519
I don't feel like myself
on all these pills.

47:08.129 --> 47:09.827
You haven't noticed?

47:11.480 --> 47:13.047
Samantha did.

47:17.530 --> 47:18.836
I'll get it. I'll get it.

47:18.879 --> 47:20.838
I'm gonna come with you.

47:20.881 --> 47:23.579
Look at you.
You want to dance?

47:23.623 --> 47:25.190
Shut up.

47:31.936 --> 47:33.851
Mr. Larson?

47:33.894 --> 47:34.895
Kaylene.

47:34.939 --> 47:36.244
Sorry to bug you this late,

47:36.288 --> 47:38.507
but I need to talk
to both of you.

47:38.551 --> 47:40.205
Sure.

47:40.248 --> 47:41.248
Thank you.

47:47.473 --> 47:50.215
We found something
inside Samantha's car

47:50.258 --> 47:53.522
that's making us think
this was not an accident.

47:53.566 --> 47:54.784
Okay.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.090
Traces of peanut residue

47:56.134 --> 47:57.415
were found all around
the steering wheel.

47:57.439 --> 47:59.572
Makes us think
somebody wanted her

47:59.615 --> 48:01.748
to have an allergic reaction
while she was driving.

48:01.791 --> 48:03.881
What?

48:03.924 --> 48:05.273
The pill was in her purse.

48:05.317 --> 48:07.101
The purse was in the back seat.

48:07.145 --> 48:08.798
Probably didn't
get to it in time,

48:08.842 --> 48:10.844
so she probably went into shock.

48:10.888 --> 48:13.107
Probably lost consciousness.

48:13.151 --> 48:15.153
And all that before the crash.

48:15.196 --> 48:18.417
How many people do you know
knew about her allergy?

48:20.593 --> 48:23.074
It wasn't like she was keeping
it a secret or anything.

48:23.117 --> 48:24.379
Everybody. You know,

48:24.423 --> 48:25.966
she was always so careful
about what she ate.

48:25.990 --> 48:27.948
She always asked people
ingredients

48:27.992 --> 48:29.819
and stuff like that.

48:29.863 --> 48:31.754
So I'm going to ask you
some of the same questions

48:31.778 --> 48:34.172
I asked your husband
after your accident, okay?

48:34.215 --> 48:36.870
Can you think of anyone
who would have hurt Samantha?

48:36.914 --> 48:38.176
No. What...

48:38.219 --> 48:40.352
- No?
- Of course not.

48:40.395 --> 48:42.310
- Everybody loved her.
- And, of course,

48:42.354 --> 48:45.183
you guys kind of had
all the same friends.

48:45.226 --> 48:46.532
She was my best friend.

48:46.575 --> 48:48.577
Because I'm not willing
to rule out the fact

48:48.621 --> 48:50.362
that whoever it is
that killed Samantha

48:50.405 --> 48:52.886
is probably the same guy
that was going after you

48:52.930 --> 48:54.018
on your bike.

48:54.061 --> 48:56.194
So I got to ask you a question,

48:56.237 --> 48:57.935
and I need you
to really think about it.

48:57.978 --> 48:59.980
Are you sure
there isn't something

49:00.024 --> 49:01.068
you're not telling me?

49:01.112 --> 49:02.548
I'm absolutely sure

49:02.591 --> 49:04.221
about everything that I'm
telling you right now.

49:04.245 --> 49:05.812
Why would I not
tell you something?

49:05.855 --> 49:06.900
Anything. Some thief...

49:06.944 --> 49:08.684
- No.
- Some rivalry...

49:08.728 --> 49:09.772
Some petty little fight.

49:09.816 --> 49:10.860
No, there's not.

49:10.904 --> 49:12.210
Nothing?

49:13.472 --> 49:15.126
You're scaring me.

49:19.217 --> 49:21.349
I'm sorry.
It's not my intention.

49:23.438 --> 49:26.615
I need you to be careful, okay?

49:26.659 --> 49:28.052
And...

49:29.662 --> 49:31.098
keep my number handy.

49:32.404 --> 49:33.404
Okay?

49:36.321 --> 49:37.931
Thank you for your time.

49:37.975 --> 49:39.498
Thank you.

49:42.501 --> 49:44.807
Whoa. Way to come in
hot, buddy.

49:44.851 --> 49:46.722
That's how he lives his life.

49:46.766 --> 49:47.897
- Daddy.
- All right.

49:47.941 --> 49:49.943
Come on, Toby.

49:49.987 --> 49:51.249
So there was actually something

49:51.292 --> 49:53.686
I wanted to talk to you about.

49:53.729 --> 49:58.343
I do, too, but, you go first.

49:59.735 --> 50:04.349
See, the last week
has been pretty rough,

50:04.392 --> 50:07.004
especially for Kaylene.

50:07.047 --> 50:09.702
I know. So horrible.

50:09.745 --> 50:13.836
So we were going to go
away for the weekend,

50:13.880 --> 50:15.316
just the four of us,

50:15.360 --> 50:18.928
so that we can
explain to the kids

50:18.972 --> 50:21.235
and just be together
as a family.

50:22.802 --> 50:24.282
I see.

50:24.325 --> 50:26.066
I knew you'd understand.

50:26.110 --> 50:27.415
I do.

50:28.547 --> 50:31.289
But, there is something

50:31.332 --> 50:34.074
that I... I've been
meaning to tell you.

50:34.118 --> 50:36.163
Now works fine.

50:37.860 --> 50:39.297
This is hard

50:39.340 --> 50:42.952
because I know it's your
wife we're talking about,

50:42.996 --> 50:44.302
and there's no question

50:44.345 --> 50:47.827
that she's improving
physically, but...

50:47.870 --> 50:50.830
her mental state is really
starting to worry me.

50:50.873 --> 50:55.052
Well, she did just
lose her best friend.

50:55.095 --> 50:56.836
I meant before the accident.

50:56.879 --> 51:01.449
She seems confused,
even paranoid at times.

51:01.493 --> 51:04.322
Maybe it's the pills she's on.

51:04.365 --> 51:07.194
This is not a medication
reaction. Trust me.

51:07.238 --> 51:09.066
This is different.

51:09.109 --> 51:11.894
She breaks into tears
over nothing.

51:11.938 --> 51:15.463
She spouts off delusions
about people out to get her.

51:15.507 --> 51:17.204
I mean, I'm...

51:18.727 --> 51:21.469
I'm worried that she's going
to try to hurt herself.

51:23.732 --> 51:24.864
No.

51:24.907 --> 51:26.300
No way.

51:26.344 --> 51:28.868
You're not around her
all day like I am.

51:28.911 --> 51:30.522
I think she's right.

51:30.565 --> 51:33.655
I think it's the
medication that she's on.

51:33.699 --> 51:36.702
Thankfully, she's going
to stop taking them soon.

51:36.745 --> 51:38.312
She can't do that.

51:38.356 --> 51:40.662
I mean, that would
definitely be a mistake.

51:40.706 --> 51:43.622
Let's see what her doctor
has to say about it.

51:43.665 --> 51:45.145
See, this is
just another example

51:45.189 --> 51:47.452
of her poor decision making.

51:47.495 --> 51:50.324
And I think it's
starting to affect you.

51:52.761 --> 51:55.199
In... In the meantime,
if you wouldn't mind

51:55.242 --> 51:56.939
going home for a few days.

51:59.072 --> 52:01.596
No. Of course not.

52:03.032 --> 52:04.730
Come on. Take us
to the swings, Daddy.

52:04.773 --> 52:06.775
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

52:16.524 --> 52:18.744
- Kaylene?
- Yeah.

52:18.787 --> 52:21.181
The door's locked.
Everything okay?

52:21.225 --> 52:22.661
Yeah. Everything's great.

52:22.704 --> 52:25.054
You sure? You seemed
a little distant

52:25.098 --> 52:26.491
at breakfast.

52:26.534 --> 52:28.623
No, I'm great. Thank you.

52:28.667 --> 52:30.886
Okay. Well, we're all
going for a swim.

52:30.930 --> 52:33.541
You want to join us
and do some pool exercises?

52:33.585 --> 52:36.979
No, thanks.
Maybe later, okay?

52:37.023 --> 52:38.807
Okay. Just let me know.

52:38.851 --> 52:39.852
Okay.

52:41.027 --> 52:43.508
Who the hell are you?

52:55.346 --> 52:57.870
Damn it, Toby.

53:00.829 --> 53:03.310
Raah!

53:03.354 --> 53:04.548
- Go!
- The lobster's in the lead,

53:04.572 --> 53:06.618
but the dolphin's catching up!

53:06.661 --> 53:07.662
No!

53:07.706 --> 53:09.186
Hey, guys.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.535
- Hey.
- You guys having fun?

53:10.578 --> 53:12.014
Yeah, Mommy.

53:12.058 --> 53:14.103
Awesome! Toby, you remember

53:14.147 --> 53:17.368
we talked about you not leaving
your cars all over the floor?

53:17.411 --> 53:18.717
They're everywhere.

53:18.760 --> 53:20.303
But I wasn't even
playing with them today.

53:20.327 --> 53:22.895
He wasn't playing
with his cars, Mommy.

53:22.938 --> 53:24.201
We were playing.

53:24.244 --> 53:25.506
You were?

53:25.550 --> 53:26.812
You look great, babe.

53:26.855 --> 53:28.683
You look like you're
going to work.

53:28.727 --> 53:31.730
Yeah. I have to go sign
those disability papers,

53:31.773 --> 53:34.211
and then they're
having some sort of

53:34.254 --> 53:36.213
get-well-soon
surprise party for me,

53:36.256 --> 53:37.692
so I'm going to go
act surprised.

53:37.736 --> 53:39.651
That's great. You're not
driving, though, right?

53:39.694 --> 53:41.305
- No, I called a cab.
- Okay.

53:41.348 --> 53:43.524
I have to be
at the airport at 4.

53:43.568 --> 53:45.222
I'll be back before then.

53:45.265 --> 53:47.311
Guys, one more picture
for Grandma.

53:47.354 --> 53:49.617
Yay! Wave!

53:49.661 --> 53:51.140
Wave, sweeties.
Say "Hi, Grandma."

53:51.184 --> 53:52.794
Hi.

53:54.840 --> 53:56.276
Cheese, Vanessa.

53:57.364 --> 53:59.627
Yay!

53:59.671 --> 54:01.150
Bye.

54:01.194 --> 54:02.282
Super flying dolphin.

54:02.326 --> 54:04.153
Raah!

54:04.197 --> 54:07.418
She looks familiar,
but I don't know who she is.

54:07.461 --> 54:09.507
She was one of my nurses here.

54:09.550 --> 54:11.335
I think I've seen her around,

54:11.378 --> 54:12.553
but I never caught her name.

54:12.597 --> 54:14.207
She says her name's
Vanessa Faraquon,

54:14.251 --> 54:16.165
but I don't think
that's her real name.

54:16.209 --> 54:18.211
Well, I'm sorry.
I can assure you

54:18.255 --> 54:19.449
there's no one here
by that name.

54:19.473 --> 54:21.258
How's that possible?
She said

54:21.301 --> 54:22.302
she's a registry nurse

54:22.346 --> 54:23.695
and that she was filling in

54:23.738 --> 54:25.566
for one of the nurses
on maternity leave.

54:25.610 --> 54:28.700
We haven't had anybody
out on maternity leave

54:28.743 --> 54:32.312
since I had my daughter
14 years ago.

54:37.186 --> 54:40.189
Ooh. Wait.
That one hurt.

54:41.974 --> 54:43.814
You know, earlier today
I went to the hospital,

54:43.845 --> 54:47.632
and just wanted to
say hi to the girls.

54:47.675 --> 54:50.330
No one had ever heard of you.

54:50.374 --> 54:52.811
I told you you.
I was just filling in.

54:52.854 --> 54:56.293
Nobody even bothered
to learn my name.

54:56.336 --> 54:59.687
They said that there were no
nurses on maternity leave.

55:01.733 --> 55:03.822
I was told someone was on leave.

55:03.865 --> 55:07.652
I mean, I just assumed it was
maternity leave, but who knows.

55:07.695 --> 55:11.438
I... I just go
wherever they tell me.

55:11.482 --> 55:13.222
Life of a traveling nurse.

55:14.702 --> 55:15.940
- How's your leg feeling?
- It's okay.

55:15.964 --> 55:17.314
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

55:17.357 --> 55:20.839
You know, it's important
to keep pushing yourself.

55:20.882 --> 55:22.710
How about we wade
a little bit deeper?

55:22.754 --> 55:25.104
Nah, that's okay.
I'm good here.

55:25.147 --> 55:26.627
Come on.

55:26.671 --> 55:29.587
Your broken leg is half
the size of your good one.

55:29.630 --> 55:32.372
You know, you gotta build
back up your muscle tone.

55:32.416 --> 55:34.418
Yeah, um...

55:34.461 --> 55:36.202
can I tell you a secret?

55:36.245 --> 55:40.424
I... I'm not really that
great of a swimmer. So...

55:40.467 --> 55:42.426
I got you.
You'll be fine.

55:42.469 --> 55:43.557
- I'm not...
- Yeah.

55:43.601 --> 55:47.822
Here. Hang onto this.
There you go.

55:47.866 --> 55:50.825
This is not gonna work 'cause my
cast is gonna get wet with this.

55:50.869 --> 55:52.412
Well, just... just rest
it on the kickboard.

55:52.436 --> 55:54.133
No, it's still gonna get wet.

55:54.176 --> 55:56.372
- I promise you, you'll be fine.
- No, see, this isn't gonna be...

55:56.396 --> 55:57.721
This isn't strong enough
to hold me.

55:57.745 --> 55:59.747
No, it's good for
someone twice your size.

55:59.791 --> 56:02.073
- No, I'm already sinking.
- So, okay, I want you to go forward.

56:02.097 --> 56:03.292
- Actually, I think I want to go back now.
- Go forward,

56:03.316 --> 56:04.665
and move your leg.

56:04.709 --> 56:06.426
- No, I just want to...
- Yeah, now move your leg.

56:06.450 --> 56:07.862
I can't touch right here.
I want to go back over there now.

56:07.886 --> 56:09.583
Now, I want you to start
treading water.

56:09.627 --> 56:11.890
No, I'm gonna go back over
there. No, I'm not okay.

56:11.933 --> 56:14.414
I'm not kidding,
I want to go back over to the edge.

56:14.458 --> 56:16.851
I want to go to the edge.
No! No!

56:16.895 --> 56:19.114
Hold onto me!
Help me, please!

56:19.158 --> 56:24.119
I can't kick up.
I can't keep above the water.

56:24.163 --> 56:25.991
It's sink or swim time.

56:28.385 --> 56:29.603
- Mommy.
- Mommy.

56:29.647 --> 56:31.170
Vanessa.

56:32.214 --> 56:33.477
Please help me!

56:33.520 --> 56:36.784
Mommy. Vanessa.

56:39.483 --> 56:40.962
Mommy.

56:46.925 --> 56:47.926
Hey, guys.

56:47.969 --> 56:49.449
We were just
doing some exercises

56:49.493 --> 56:50.798
to make her legs stronger.

56:52.234 --> 56:55.194
Kids, go inside.
There's no swimming right now.

56:55.237 --> 56:56.500
Please?

56:56.543 --> 56:59.241
Go back inside.
I'll meet you inside.

57:03.855 --> 57:06.597
- Get out of my house.
- Kaylene.

57:08.076 --> 57:09.338
What's going on, Mommy?

57:09.382 --> 57:10.862
Um, nothing, everything's fine.

57:10.905 --> 57:12.745
I think you guys just
go over to Mrs. Gilbert's

57:12.777 --> 57:14.387
for a couple hours, okay?

57:14.431 --> 57:15.780
But why?

57:15.823 --> 57:17.956
Um, just because I have to
deal with a couple things,

57:17.999 --> 57:19.523
one of the...

57:19.566 --> 57:23.527
One of the neighbors is having a...
problem, so...

57:23.570 --> 57:24.939
- I'm just gonna help fix it.
- Kaylene.

57:24.963 --> 57:26.355
Is everything okay?

57:26.399 --> 57:28.290
Yeah, can you watch the kids
for a couple of hours?

57:28.314 --> 57:30.882
Of course.
Anything else I can do?

57:30.925 --> 57:32.729
Yeah, please just keep them
inside today, okay?

57:32.753 --> 57:34.189
All right.
By the way,

57:34.233 --> 57:36.235
you never returned my call
from the other day.

57:36.278 --> 57:37.715
What call?

57:37.758 --> 57:40.631
I left you a voicemail,
said it was important we talk.

57:40.674 --> 57:43.068
No, I didn't get it.
What was it about?

57:44.983 --> 57:46.506
How about I email you instead?

57:46.550 --> 57:47.768
Okay, great.

57:47.812 --> 57:49.640
Look, Mommy, it's the police.

57:49.683 --> 57:51.772
Dear, what's that about?

57:51.816 --> 57:55.036
Um, it's okay.
I called them because

57:55.080 --> 57:58.605
- you know how that neighbor is
having that problem? - Right, yes.

57:58.649 --> 58:00.825
Kids, let's have
some ice cream, okay?

58:05.830 --> 58:07.832
There's no problem here,
officer.

58:07.875 --> 58:10.138
I'm... I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

58:10.182 --> 58:11.662
And do you work here?

58:11.705 --> 58:13.794
I'm Kaylene's home care nurse.

58:13.838 --> 58:16.057
She was in a car accident
a few weeks ago,

58:16.101 --> 58:18.233
and suffered a number of
serious injuries,

58:18.277 --> 58:19.757
including head trauma.

58:19.800 --> 58:23.587
And there is still some paranoia
and delusional thinking.

58:23.630 --> 58:25.197
No, I'm not paranoid, officer.

58:25.240 --> 58:28.809
She just tried to
drown me in my pool.

58:28.853 --> 58:31.377
We were doing some simple
physical therapy.

58:31.420 --> 58:33.727
Kaylene had some
difficulty with it,

58:33.771 --> 58:38.079
and... now she thinks
I was trying to kill her.

58:38.123 --> 58:39.994
She is trying to kill me.

58:40.038 --> 58:42.606
Can I see both your IDs please?

58:42.649 --> 58:44.912
- Is that really necessary?
- That's very interesting.

58:44.956 --> 58:46.523
You don't want to
show him your ID? Why?

58:46.566 --> 58:48.699
You don't want us to know
what your real name is?

58:50.352 --> 58:52.311
Officer.

58:52.354 --> 58:54.245
When she comes back,
she's gonna show you her ID,

58:54.269 --> 58:55.638
and it's not gonna be the
name that she claims to be.

58:55.662 --> 58:56.942
I looked her up on the computer,

58:56.968 --> 58:58.665
I Googled her there's nothing.

58:58.709 --> 59:00.643
She's not even on social
media, she doesn't exist.

59:00.667 --> 59:02.582
Is your husband home
by any chance?

59:02.626 --> 59:05.106
He's not home right now.
He's a commercial airline pilot.

59:05.150 --> 59:06.630
He's on a flight right now.

59:06.673 --> 59:09.546
- When will he be back?
- Yesterday.

59:09.589 --> 59:12.592
I mean, today, I think.

59:12.636 --> 59:15.073
Okay.
Your ID, please.

59:15.116 --> 59:16.311
- Here, officer.
- I'll go get...

59:16.335 --> 59:18.119
I brought both of our IDs.

59:18.163 --> 59:22.254
Where'd you get my ID?
You went into my purse and got my ID?

59:22.297 --> 59:24.473
This is not your home.

59:24.517 --> 59:26.084
This is my home!

59:26.127 --> 59:30.610
Kaylene, your license
was on the table. Remember?

59:30.654 --> 59:32.307
It wasn't in your purse.

59:33.657 --> 59:35.572
Let's see what her real name is.

59:35.615 --> 59:37.312
- What's her name?
- Vanessa Ren...

59:37.356 --> 59:39.140
Renzy? Wh... Renzy?

59:39.184 --> 59:40.683
That's not what
you said your name was.

59:40.707 --> 59:42.491
You said your name was
Vanessa Faraquan.

59:42.535 --> 59:44.992
Renzy is my maiden name.
I... I just never got around to changing it

59:45.016 --> 59:46.887
- at the DMV.
- Is there anyone else

59:46.931 --> 59:49.213
- who can come over and be with you
right now? - No, there's no one...

59:49.237 --> 59:51.215
- A friend?
- I don't need anyone else to come here.

59:51.239 --> 59:54.373
I just want you to remove this
woman from my home permanently.

59:57.071 --> 59:58.595
I think,
under the circumstances,

59:58.638 --> 01:00:00.224
that might be the best
thing to do right now.

01:00:00.248 --> 01:00:03.425
Officer, it would be
medically unethical

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:06.341
for me to leave her alone
in this state right now.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.822
It's my husband calling.

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.610
- Kaylene.
- Drew, where are you right now?

01:00:13.653 --> 01:00:15.718
- I know you want her gone.
- Yes, I do want her out.

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:17.831
- She tried to kill me.
- Chill.

01:00:17.875 --> 01:00:20.201
There is a police officer here right
now, and he's gonna escort her out.

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:21.942
- There's a police officer there?
- Wait. Wait, wait.

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:23.160
- Wait, wait.
- What is going on?

01:00:23.184 --> 01:00:24.664
How do you already
know about this?

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:28.755
She called me.
I already spoke to Vanessa.

01:00:28.799 --> 01:00:30.627
You called my husband?

01:00:30.670 --> 01:00:34.456
I called him just now because
we were both worried about you.

01:00:34.500 --> 01:00:37.938
- Drew, I need you to stop
talking to this wo... - Chill.

01:00:37.982 --> 01:00:40.767
- I'm totally calm!
- Let me speak to the officer.

01:00:40.811 --> 01:00:42.160
Yes, hold on.

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:48.340
My husband wants to
talk to you for a second.

01:00:51.343 --> 01:00:53.824
- Yes, Mr. Larsen.
- I'm on my way home.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.129
- I understand.
- Until then,

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:57.088
she should not be left alone.

01:00:57.131 --> 01:00:58.437
Thank you for clearing that up.

01:01:00.352 --> 01:01:02.876
Your husband says he's coming
home early to be with you.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.705
Until then,
he'd rather you not be alone.

01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:43.264
Who else have you
been keeping from me?

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:06.200
Hello. You've reached the
Oakdale Fertility Clinic.

01:02:06.244 --> 01:02:08.246
Please leave a message
and someone from our team

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:10.422
will get back to you
as soon as possible.

01:02:10.465 --> 01:02:12.467
Hi, this is Kaylene Larsen.

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:14.295
Um, I see that I have
a missed call from you.

01:02:14.339 --> 01:02:15.775
Can you have someone
call me back

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:18.212
as soon as possible
at this number?

01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:19.257
Thank you.

01:02:32.444 --> 01:02:34.141
Where are you going?

01:02:34.185 --> 01:02:36.578
You win.
Enjoy the house.

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:55.902
Yes, can I help you?

01:02:55.946 --> 01:02:58.731
I... Sorry to bother you.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:02.213
Do you happen to know
Vanessa Renzy?

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.605
No.

01:03:03.649 --> 01:03:04.955
What has she done now?

01:03:04.998 --> 01:03:06.913
Can I come in for a minute?

01:03:08.915 --> 01:03:10.090
Of course.

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:16.183
Well, things were
never the same again

01:03:16.227 --> 01:03:18.446
after the diagnosis
a couple of years ago.

01:03:18.490 --> 01:03:21.188
She, um, got very depressed.

01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:23.147
Couldn't get herself out of bed.

01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:26.367
And, um...
she lost her job, then her home.

01:03:28.195 --> 01:03:31.068
Do you mind if I ask
what she was diagnosed with?

01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:32.983
- What do they call it?

01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:36.377
Premature ovarian insufficiency.

01:03:36.421 --> 01:03:39.598
It basically means that
she can't have children.

01:03:39.641 --> 01:03:41.861
Right.

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.820
So, after she got
this diagnosis,

01:03:43.863 --> 01:03:46.953
that's when she found out that
her husband had died in the war?

01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:48.476
What?

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.087
Did she tell you that?

01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:51.281
I don't know what to tell you,

01:03:51.305 --> 01:03:53.133
but Vanessa's
never been married.

01:03:53.177 --> 01:03:55.875
She's come close.
Always wanted to be.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.051
Wanted kids, too.

01:03:59.226 --> 01:04:01.925
I don't know
what happened to her.

01:04:02.926 --> 01:04:04.884
I'm sorry.

01:04:04.928 --> 01:04:06.688
You know,
she came back home and moped around

01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:08.888
for about a year.

01:04:08.932 --> 01:04:11.325
And then, like,
a switch went off.

01:04:11.369 --> 01:04:12.544
She was fine.

01:04:12.587 --> 01:04:14.304
She went back to school,
got a part-time job,

01:04:14.328 --> 01:04:15.895
started looking for
an apartment.

01:04:15.939 --> 01:04:19.812
We really thought that
she'd moved on.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.988
So...

01:04:22.032 --> 01:04:23.947
what has she done now?

01:04:24.948 --> 01:04:28.038
She's obsessed with my family.

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:30.910
And it's starting to
scare me a little bit.

01:04:30.954 --> 01:04:32.607
So, I'm just
trying to figure out

01:04:32.651 --> 01:04:35.088
what's going on with her.

01:04:35.132 --> 01:04:37.438
I don't know if you've ever...

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:42.530
seen her obsessed with
anyone in the past, or...

01:04:42.574 --> 01:04:47.274
No, she's been a loner
these past two years.

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:49.624
Can I ask how you two met?

01:04:49.668 --> 01:04:51.061
Yeah.

01:04:51.104 --> 01:04:53.541
She pretended to be
my nurse at St. Vincent's.

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:54.934
Pardon?

01:04:54.978 --> 01:04:57.502
I'm gonna guess she's
not a nurse, either.

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:00.505
She has a medical background.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:03.464
She went to pharmacy school.
I was so proud of her.

01:05:04.988 --> 01:05:06.380
But she is not a nurse.

01:05:10.167 --> 01:05:12.125
I... I really want to help.

01:05:12.169 --> 01:05:15.433
But the truth is, I...

01:05:15.476 --> 01:05:18.523
haven't seen or heard from her
since she borrowed my car

01:05:18.566 --> 01:05:20.525
over a month ago.

01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:21.743
I really miss her.

01:05:23.702 --> 01:05:25.008
Will you ask her to call me?

01:05:25.051 --> 01:05:27.532
Yes, of course.

01:05:27.575 --> 01:05:28.576
Thank you.

01:05:33.973 --> 01:05:35.366
Hello.
Hi, this is Kaylene.

01:05:35.409 --> 01:05:37.281
Um, thank you so much
for returning my call.

01:05:37.324 --> 01:05:38.717
Hi, Kaylene.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.850
We already spoke last week.
Don't you remember?

01:05:41.894 --> 01:05:44.201
No, I don't.

01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:47.204
Yes, we did.
I placed the call myself.

01:05:47.247 --> 01:05:48.683
You answered,

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:50.511
and I connected you to
Dr. Bartelini.

01:05:50.555 --> 01:05:52.731
Right.
What did we discuss?

01:05:56.126 --> 01:05:58.084
That's really more for
the doctor to say.

01:05:58.128 --> 01:06:00.149
Can you please tell the doctor
that I'm going to be there

01:06:00.173 --> 01:06:01.609
in exactly ten minutes,

01:06:01.653 --> 01:06:04.003
and I really need to
speak to her in person.

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:06.005
Okay.
We'll see you then.

01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.224
Thank you.

01:06:12.751 --> 01:06:15.623
So, it wasn't you I was
speaking with last week?

01:06:15.667 --> 01:06:17.669
No.

01:06:17.712 --> 01:06:19.018
Who was it?

01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:20.628
I think it was
my home care nurse.

01:06:20.672 --> 01:06:23.327
What exactly were you
calling me about?

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:27.113
We had a privacy breach
with one of our employees.

01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:29.463
Or should I say,
former employees.

01:06:29.507 --> 01:06:31.813
She got a job here
under false pretenses,

01:06:31.857 --> 01:06:34.947
using a fake ID and
falsified qualifications.

01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:37.994
We didn't discover that
until she disappeared one day

01:06:38.037 --> 01:06:40.474
with another male employee.

01:06:40.518 --> 01:06:41.519
Okay.

01:06:44.565 --> 01:06:47.829
The police found his body
a couple of weeks ago.

01:06:47.873 --> 01:06:50.615
Now, we don't know if she
had anything to do with it,

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:53.879
but there was talk that the two
were having sexual relations.

01:06:53.922 --> 01:06:57.056
Okay, well, this sounds awful,

01:06:57.100 --> 01:06:59.624
- but I just don't know what it
has to do with me. - Kaylene.

01:07:01.669 --> 01:07:04.455
He was our egg donation
database coordinator.

01:07:04.498 --> 01:07:05.867
We have reason to believe
that he was

01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:09.634
accessing and sharing
private patient records.

01:07:09.677 --> 01:07:10.765
Not my records.

01:07:12.593 --> 01:07:14.030
Yes.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:18.512
Now, I want you to know that we
are doing everything that we can...

01:07:18.556 --> 01:07:20.036
I'm sorry, I have to
interrupt you.

01:07:20.079 --> 01:07:21.602
Is that her?

01:07:26.129 --> 01:07:27.434
That's her.

01:07:27.478 --> 01:07:31.090
Her hair is different,
but that is definitely her.

01:07:31.134 --> 01:07:33.832
- Is she your nurse?
- Yes.

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.532
Okay, Kaylene, I know the DA's
still working on the case,

01:07:38.576 --> 01:07:40.554
but I think that you should
call the police right away,

01:07:40.578 --> 01:07:42.512
because as far as I know,
they are still looking for her.

01:07:42.536 --> 01:07:44.669
What do you think
she wants from me?

01:07:45.931 --> 01:07:47.387
I know you came in this
from the other end,

01:07:47.411 --> 01:07:48.716
but a lot of girls in college,

01:07:48.760 --> 01:07:51.502
they donate their eggs
for tuition money.

01:07:51.545 --> 01:07:53.741
It pays well and they never
have to think about it again.

01:07:53.765 --> 01:07:56.985
So she's an egg donor?

01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:59.379
She's your egg donor.

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:01.303
You were the only one
to carry pregnancy to term

01:08:01.338 --> 01:08:03.340
with embryos
derived from her eggs.

01:08:04.732 --> 01:08:06.691
In her warped mind,
I think she believes

01:08:06.734 --> 01:08:09.607
your children are her children.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:12.262
I'm so sorry.

01:08:21.184 --> 01:08:23.533
Babe.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:24.883
I'm home.

01:08:24.926 --> 01:08:26.885
Hi, honey.

01:08:26.928 --> 01:08:28.365
How was your trip?

01:08:39.506 --> 01:08:42.073
Vanessa.
What the...

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:44.511
Shh. Honey.

01:08:44.555 --> 01:08:47.688
I want you to listen to me.
Okay?

01:08:47.732 --> 01:08:51.518
The last thing I want to do
is shoot you.

01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:52.562
I love you.

01:08:53.999 --> 01:08:56.305
You know that?

01:08:56.349 --> 01:08:58.917
You're the father
of our children.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.224
That's right.

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.529
My eggs,

01:09:03.573 --> 01:09:05.184
your sperm.

01:09:05.228 --> 01:09:08.144
It's a shame they couldn't get
together in a more fun way.

01:09:09.274 --> 01:09:14.453
But what I need for you
to do for us right now

01:09:14.497 --> 01:09:16.978
is drink that smoothie.

01:09:17.022 --> 01:09:18.979
It's not gonna hurt you.

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:21.548
It's just gonna take
the edge off.

01:09:21.591 --> 01:09:22.984
Vanessa...

01:09:27.772 --> 01:09:29.729
Drink your smoothie, honey.

01:09:49.968 --> 01:09:52.231
It's gonna be a fun night.

01:09:58.542 --> 01:10:00.544
Hello.
This is Eileen Gilberts.

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:03.547
Leave a message and I'll get
back to you as soon as I can.

01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:05.244
Thank you.
Have a nice day.

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:06.419
Damn it.

01:10:09.292 --> 01:10:12.382
You've never been in my
car, have you?

01:10:12.425 --> 01:10:14.427
It's brand new.
I love it.

01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:19.780
My old car is a wreck.

01:10:19.824 --> 01:10:22.609
Some clueless bitch on a bicycle

01:10:22.653 --> 01:10:25.482
totally smashed in
the front end.

01:10:27.092 --> 01:10:28.311
Hey, kids.

01:10:29.573 --> 01:10:32.184
We're almost there.

01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:34.273
You guys are gonna love it.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:36.144
There's this beautiful lake

01:10:36.188 --> 01:10:37.711
where everybody goes swimming,

01:10:37.755 --> 01:10:40.148
and boating.

01:10:40.192 --> 01:10:42.629
Someone's tired?

01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:45.502
You go back to sleep, baby.

01:10:45.545 --> 01:10:48.461
I'll wake you up
when we get there.

01:11:07.132 --> 01:11:08.742
My God. Mrs.
Gilberts, are you okay?

01:11:08.786 --> 01:11:11.005
- I'm gonna call 9-1-1.
- No, no, no, I'm okay.

01:11:11.049 --> 01:11:13.051
I'm okay.
It's the kids.

01:11:13.094 --> 01:11:14.095
Where are the kids?

01:11:14.139 --> 01:11:15.314
She took them.

01:11:15.358 --> 01:11:16.718
I tried to stop her,
I swear I did,

01:11:16.750 --> 01:11:18.970
but she hit me with
one of my gold clubs.

01:11:19.013 --> 01:11:21.407
Tell me where you think
she took the kids.

01:11:21.451 --> 01:11:22.887
I don't know.
I'm so sorry.

01:11:22.930 --> 01:11:25.063
Just go find them. Go!

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:35.421
Hello?

01:11:44.169 --> 01:11:45.169
Drew?

01:11:48.478 --> 01:11:49.653
Guys?

01:11:51.829 --> 01:11:52.829
Hey!

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:54.832
Hello!

01:11:56.181 --> 01:11:57.487
Zoey?

01:12:09.847 --> 01:12:11.849
Guys?

01:12:11.892 --> 01:12:12.893
Drew?

01:12:14.242 --> 01:12:16.767
Toby!

01:12:16.810 --> 01:12:18.377
Zoey!

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:20.292
Drew!

01:12:20.336 --> 01:12:22.294
Zoey!

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.904
My God.

01:12:25.515 --> 01:12:26.820
My God.

01:12:28.431 --> 01:12:29.823
Hello. Hi,

01:12:29.867 --> 01:12:31.869
I need to speak to
Detective Dawkins right now.

01:12:31.912 --> 01:12:34.088
Please tell him it's
Kaylene Larsen calling.

01:12:34.132 --> 01:12:36.352
Um, it's important.
It's an emergency.

01:12:40.921 --> 01:12:42.401
Detective.

01:12:42.445 --> 01:12:46.100
I think the home care nurse
has kidnapped my children.

01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:49.974
No, my husband's car
isn't here, either.

01:12:50.017 --> 01:12:51.236
See you soon.

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:03.640
Come on.
Come on.

01:13:09.820 --> 01:13:13.389
This woman was an egg donor
at the fertility clinic

01:13:13.432 --> 01:13:14.781
where I had done my IVF.

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:16.063
It's supposed to be
completely anonymous,

01:13:16.087 --> 01:13:17.760
but as a matter of
a couple of years later,

01:13:17.784 --> 01:13:20.874
this person finds out that
she can't have kids anymore,

01:13:20.918 --> 01:13:22.330
- and that's when she started freaking out.
- Wait, wait.

01:13:22.354 --> 01:13:23.442
So she investigated,

01:13:23.486 --> 01:13:25.270
found out who had her eggs,

01:13:25.313 --> 01:13:28.142
and then you're saying she seduced
and took out the clinic employee?

01:13:28.186 --> 01:13:30.077
Yeah, then she thought she could
kill me and move in on my family.

01:13:30.101 --> 01:13:31.818
She had to follow you around
for at least two weeks

01:13:31.842 --> 01:13:33.974
to figure out your routine
and your bike route.

01:13:34.018 --> 01:13:35.778
I mean, my friend Samantha,
she saw it right away.

01:13:35.802 --> 01:13:37.563
She said there's something
off with this girl.

01:13:37.587 --> 01:13:39.042
I was so out of it
I didn't realize it.

01:13:39.066 --> 01:13:41.329
No, it was my fault,
I was so overmedicated,

01:13:41.373 --> 01:13:42.679
I should have
been there for her.

01:13:42.722 --> 01:13:45.246
She was gonna take me to
a doctor the day she died.

01:13:46.813 --> 01:13:48.859
- Samantha was?
- Yeah.

01:13:48.902 --> 01:13:51.818
So Vanessa probably killed
her to keep her quiet.

01:13:51.862 --> 01:13:54.255
I'm gonna call in
for back up, okay?

01:13:54.299 --> 01:13:56.519
When we get to the cabin,
I need you to stay in the car.

01:13:56.562 --> 01:13:57.583
I'm not staying in the car.

01:13:57.607 --> 01:13:58.825
Stay in the car.

01:13:58.869 --> 01:14:00.348
She already tried to
kill you once,

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.065
please don't give her
a chance to do it again.

01:14:02.089 --> 01:14:04.701
This woman has kidnapped
my husband and my kids.

01:14:04.744 --> 01:14:06.703
I'm not just gonna
sit in the car.

01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:07.897
Give me a chance to
go in there first,

01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:09.314
and try to reason with her.

01:14:09.357 --> 01:14:11.403
Come up with some sort of
peaceful solution.

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:13.536
- Solution?
- You gotta trust me,

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:16.495
and stay your ass in the car.

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:31.510
I spent all of my
summers here growing up.

01:14:34.992 --> 01:14:40.563
I used to spend hours sitting
right here at this table.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:42.478
Playing checkers with my dad,

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:46.090
or doing jigsaw puzzles.

01:14:46.133 --> 01:14:49.310
I have the best memories
of this place.

01:14:49.354 --> 01:14:53.532
I always knew that I would
bring my own family here.

01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:58.755
It makes me so happy
that day's finally come.

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.539
Don't you love it here?

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.367
I want my mommy.

01:15:02.410 --> 01:15:03.934
Sweetie.

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:06.937
I'm right here.

01:15:06.980 --> 01:15:09.374
I'm your mommy.

01:15:09.417 --> 01:15:11.158
We want our real mommy.

01:15:11.202 --> 01:15:14.510
I am your real mommy, damn it.

01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.558
You can ask your daddy.
It's a fact.

01:15:20.733 --> 01:15:23.257
That other lady
was just an imposter.

01:15:23.301 --> 01:15:27.087
A cheap stand in until
I was able to find you.

01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:32.136
Vanessa.
You're scaring them.

01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:36.053
Why are they scared?

01:15:37.271 --> 01:15:40.536
I mean, we're finally
all together.

01:15:40.579 --> 01:15:43.974
If... you put the gun away,
it would help.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.588
You know, I wish I could.

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.244
But I don't trust you.

01:15:55.812 --> 01:15:57.509
Now, I know that, eventually,

01:15:57.553 --> 01:15:59.250
you'll learn to love me, but...

01:16:00.904 --> 01:16:03.167
until that happens,
I need this gun

01:16:03.210 --> 01:16:06.997
to insure that my family
will never leave me.

01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:09.608
I want to go home.

01:16:09.652 --> 01:16:12.611
We are home.

01:16:12.655 --> 01:16:14.700
This is our home now.

01:16:16.006 --> 01:16:18.617
No one will ever bother us here.

01:16:27.670 --> 01:16:29.323
God.

01:16:29.367 --> 01:16:34.285
You know, all I ever wanted
was for us to be together.

01:16:34.328 --> 01:16:36.896
Is that so much to ask?

01:16:36.940 --> 01:16:38.202
Hey.

01:16:38.245 --> 01:16:41.335
It was... It was
a long ride up here.

01:16:41.379 --> 01:16:44.077
We're tired and hungry.

01:16:44.121 --> 01:16:45.921
Maybe if they take a nap,
they'll feel better.

01:16:49.213 --> 01:16:50.213
Okay.

01:16:52.433 --> 01:16:53.434
That's a good idea.

01:16:56.481 --> 01:17:00.833
Daddy is gonna go
show you to your room.

01:17:00.877 --> 01:17:02.487
Right in there.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:04.532
While Mommy tidies up a bit.

01:17:04.576 --> 01:17:06.012
Yeah.

01:17:06.056 --> 01:17:07.056
Come on.

01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:12.366
Then we'll go into town
and get some groceries.

01:17:21.462 --> 01:17:23.421
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:31.037
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:17:31.081 --> 01:17:34.432
But I need you to stay in here.

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:36.826
With the door closed.

01:17:36.869 --> 01:17:39.306
And after I leave,

01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:41.831
I want you to lock it.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:43.484
You see that little button?

01:17:43.528 --> 01:17:44.747
Just turn it.

01:17:47.532 --> 01:17:49.577
And don't open the door again

01:17:49.621 --> 01:17:51.710
'til you know it's me.
Okay?

01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:53.364
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:57.020
I promise, I'm gonna
get us out of here,

01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.283
and back to Mommy
just as soon as I can.

01:18:08.422 --> 01:18:09.467
I love you.

01:18:09.510 --> 01:18:11.164
I love you, too.

01:18:34.057 --> 01:18:38.322
Don't you think Zoey
looks exactly like me?

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:39.758
Yeah.

01:18:39.802 --> 01:18:42.630
I can see the resemblance.

01:18:42.674 --> 01:18:45.851
I think...

01:18:45.895 --> 01:18:47.374
there's a reason

01:18:47.418 --> 01:18:51.248
why you chose my eggs
over all the others.

01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:54.338
It's destiny that we
made this family together.

01:18:56.557 --> 01:18:59.473
We... are the parents

01:18:59.517 --> 01:19:02.607
of those beautiful kids, baby.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.000
You and me.

01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:06.698
Not some rich bitch.

01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:09.788
Who was able to plunk down
thousands of dollars

01:19:09.832 --> 01:19:13.139
to buy the children
of her choice.

01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:18.841
But that's all ancient history.

01:19:18.884 --> 01:19:22.801
Now, we finally have the chance

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:26.065
to be the family we were
always meant to be.

01:19:35.945 --> 01:19:37.860
Is that hers?

01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:39.557
Do you like it?

01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:41.864
I had it refitted.

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:45.868
I mean, my fingers were a little
more slender than hers, but...

01:19:45.911 --> 01:19:49.523
I finally have
everything I ever wanted.

01:20:37.615 --> 01:20:40.313
Drew's car.

01:20:40.357 --> 01:20:41.880
Hey! Hey!

01:20:41.924 --> 01:20:43.621
Stay in the car.

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:01.900
I'm okay.

01:21:01.944 --> 01:21:02.945
Hey.

01:21:02.988 --> 01:21:05.425
Hey!
Where are you going?

01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:18.786
- Hi.
- Mommy.

01:21:18.830 --> 01:21:20.571
- Mommy.
- Unlock it. Here.

01:21:20.614 --> 01:21:24.357
Hi, sweetie. Hi.
Good, good, good.

01:21:24.401 --> 01:21:25.968
Come on. Come out.
Come out.

01:21:26.011 --> 01:21:27.554
I'm gonna chase you.
You run and hide, okay?

01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:29.449
Go and hide. Come on, sweetie.
Run, run, run.

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:31.582
Make sure you stay close by.

01:21:31.625 --> 01:21:32.975
I love you.

01:21:33.018 --> 01:21:34.672
I love you.

01:21:36.065 --> 01:21:37.849
This is all your fault.

01:21:37.893 --> 01:21:40.939
You'd have been so happy.

01:21:40.983 --> 01:21:43.637
You wouldn't even
give us a chance.

01:21:47.772 --> 01:21:50.427
At least this way...

01:21:51.863 --> 01:21:53.647
We can be together forever.

01:22:20.152 --> 01:22:22.067
Kids, please open the door.

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:26.724
What the...

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:44.916
You have no idea
how long I have...

01:23:13.814 --> 01:23:16.165
Zoey and Toby!

01:23:17.818 --> 01:23:19.168
Zoey!

01:23:19.211 --> 01:23:21.170
- Mommy! Daddy!
- Daddy!

01:23:21.213 --> 01:23:22.606
- Daddy!
- Mommy!

01:23:22.649 --> 01:23:23.955
Come on.
Come on.

01:23:23.999 --> 01:23:25.739
Hi.

01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:45.716
- Can you get that?
- Yeah.

01:23:45.759 --> 01:23:48.066
Mrs. Gilberts.

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:51.026
Hi, Mrs. Gilberts.
It's Kaylene.

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:52.810
Yeah.

01:23:54.072 --> 01:23:55.204
You're here?

01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:59.077
Yeah, we just got on the pathway

01:23:59.121 --> 01:24:00.600
right along the water.

01:24:02.559 --> 01:24:03.603
Wait, who?

01:24:04.691 --> 01:24:07.216
Look who just showed up
this morning?

01:24:07.259 --> 01:24:09.392
Pickles!

01:24:09.435 --> 01:24:11.002
My God.

01:24:11.046 --> 01:24:14.440
Yeah.
She's fine.

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:17.487
- Yeah, she just...
- My goodness.

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.793
- Babe, you did that?
- Yeah.

01:24:19.837 --> 01:24:23.667
And who's the little
friend we have here?
