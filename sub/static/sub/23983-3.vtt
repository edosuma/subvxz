WEBVTT

00:00.828 --> 00:03.160
So it turns out
the mysterious jock strap

00:03.171 --> 00:04.497
belongs to Mr. Alvarez,

00:04.499 --> 00:07.333
who... twist... is now dead.

00:07.335 --> 00:09.739
What? Aw, another
hair-raising tale

00:09.750 --> 00:11.204
from the lost and found.

00:11.206 --> 00:13.370
- Fun meeting.
- So I was going over

00:13.381 --> 00:15.840
the books, and our membership
numbers took a dive last month.

00:15.851 --> 00:17.944
Well, Dad always said
memberships are like the tide...

00:17.955 --> 00:19.076
goes up, goes down.

00:19.087 --> 00:21.582
- No one knows why.
- Except we do know how tides work.

00:21.593 --> 00:24.037
When people go in the ocean,
it rises, like a bathtub.

00:24.039 --> 00:25.672
No, it's because of
the moon's gravity.

00:25.674 --> 00:28.708
Okay, the moon
does not have gravity.

00:28.710 --> 00:30.644
All right? That's why
's bouncy up there.

00:30.646 --> 00:32.345
Okay, let's not question
Dad's wisdom.

00:32.347 --> 00:33.753
The guy ran this place for decades

00:33.764 --> 00:35.851
and I doubt he ever panicked
about losing a few members.

00:36.885 --> 00:38.307
See, this is what I'm talking about.

00:38.318 --> 00:40.687
Mrs. Harrington's
been a member since the '70s.

00:40.689 --> 00:42.656
Our loyal members will keep
this place afloat.

00:42.658 --> 00:45.592
- What's good, babe?
- It's the hardcore rap music

00:45.594 --> 00:48.128
- out there.
- Oh, did you want rap-rock?

00:48.130 --> 00:49.829
Slipknot, Limp Biz... we got it all.

00:49.831 --> 00:51.932
Actually, the gals and I
were kinda wondering

00:51.934 --> 00:55.359
if maybe you could rotate in
some Carole King.

00:55.370 --> 00:56.702
On it, Mrs. H.

00:56.713 --> 00:58.596
Alexa, play Matthew's.

00:58.607 --> 01:02.133
"Now That's What I Call Feminism Mix."

01:03.245 --> 01:05.806
Matthew, I don't think that works
if you don't have an Alexa.

01:05.817 --> 01:08.481
Yeah, Mrs. H,
I'm so sorry,

01:08.483 --> 01:11.218
but we can't play any Carole King.

01:11.220 --> 01:12.837
It's a safety issue. You see,

01:12.848 --> 01:15.755
if I got a guy out there on the
bench trying to put up two fiddy,

01:15.757 --> 01:17.857
and then "Tapestry" comes on,

01:17.859 --> 01:20.393
he might fall asleep and get crushed.

01:20.395 --> 01:23.296
I'll just take
my hearing aid out.

01:23.298 --> 01:25.799
- Thanks anyway.
- All right, cool. Thanks.

01:25.801 --> 01:28.501
Dana, that's leadership.

01:30.906 --> 01:34.207
Siri, get me an Alexa.

01:36.848 --> 01:39.371
- Synced and corrected by Shazi89 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:43.819 --> 01:48.054
Wow, this meal was the best
Asian-American fusion since my birth.

01:48.056 --> 01:49.516
You're clearly
buttering me up.

01:49.527 --> 01:51.008
- What'd you do?
- Nothing big.

01:51.019 --> 01:53.226
I just got a D on a math test
and I need you to sign it.

01:53.228 --> 01:55.891
A D? Wow, gay kids finally
gained some acceptance

01:55.902 --> 01:57.833
and suddenly you're not
the smart ones anymore.

01:57.844 --> 02:01.034
Who cares? Okay, I'm an artist, not
a black woman at NASA in the '60s.

02:01.036 --> 02:02.702
The only numbers I need to know are...

02:02.704 --> 02:04.196
a five, six, seven, eight...

02:04.207 --> 02:06.162
You're not "Chorus Line-ing"
your way out of this one.

02:06.173 --> 02:07.907
Look, everyone needs to know math.

02:07.909 --> 02:10.110
What if Broadway doesn't work out?

02:11.546 --> 02:14.848
Wow, the claws come out now.

02:14.850 --> 02:16.850
Look, if you truly believed in me,

02:16.852 --> 02:18.918
you wouldn't make me
learn math as a fallback.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.554
Look, no one can count
on their dreams coming true.

02:21.556 --> 02:23.690
Everyone needs a plan B.

02:23.692 --> 02:24.877
You're getting a tutor.

02:24.888 --> 02:27.360
Ugh! I hate school.

02:27.362 --> 02:29.596
You moved here
to go to school.

02:33.068 --> 02:35.201
- You got Pasquesi.
<i>- Hey, it's Vince Cook.</i>

02:35.203 --> 02:39.039
Uh, I was wondering if you could
recommend a math tutor for Michael.

02:39.041 --> 02:40.707
Oh, of course.
What type of math.

02:40.709 --> 02:42.429
Uh, I have no idea.

02:42.440 --> 02:44.223
Math wasn't really
my thing in high school.

02:44.234 --> 02:46.713
I was more of a cool athlete
that got laid a lot.

02:46.715 --> 02:48.682
I'm sorry, are you
bragging to me

02:48.684 --> 02:50.817
about how cool you were 17 years ago?

02:50.819 --> 02:52.519
Uh, I'm just
stating facts, man.

02:52.521 --> 02:54.788
If you're impressed,
that's on you.

02:55.891 --> 02:58.625
There's a tutor from MIT
I think would be a good fit.

02:58.627 --> 03:00.727
He does all of his math writing
on windowpanes.

03:00.729 --> 03:02.629
And he's a steal at only $200.

03:02.631 --> 03:04.812
- For the year?
- For the hour.

03:05.916 --> 03:08.702
Pasquesi, you tripping.

03:08.704 --> 03:09.769
Who does that?

03:09.771 --> 03:12.939
So I figured out
why our numbers are declining.

03:12.941 --> 03:15.542
Turns out women over 40
are abandoning the gym

03:15.544 --> 03:17.677
faster than they abandoned
Hillary Clinton.

03:17.679 --> 03:19.512
- White women.
- Wait, what?

03:19.514 --> 03:21.881
Middle-aged ladies
are our best customers.

03:21.883 --> 03:23.483
Well, I found the culprit.

03:23.485 --> 03:26.019
An all-female gym
opened up two blocks away.

03:26.021 --> 03:27.754
- It's called Lumps.
- Okay, whatever.

03:27.756 --> 03:29.589
I'm not gonna be bothered
by some fad gym.

03:29.591 --> 03:31.224
- Won't last.
- You also said that

03:31.226 --> 03:33.960
about red velvet cupcakes
and they're still everywhere.

03:33.962 --> 03:35.295
- I'm worried now.
- Why?

03:35.297 --> 03:36.963
Lumps isn't even a workout.

03:36.965 --> 03:39.599
It's just a place where women
sit on exercise equipment

03:39.601 --> 03:41.735
and brag about finding
a good parking spot.

03:41.737 --> 03:44.904
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
An all-women's gym is fine,

03:44.906 --> 03:46.706
but if wanted to start an all-male gym,

03:46.708 --> 03:50.343
suddenly Lena Dunham's creating
another hashtag about me.

03:50.345 --> 03:52.112
From what I've read,
it provides women

03:52.114 --> 03:54.681
a safe place to work out
without feeling self-conscious

03:54.683 --> 03:56.416
or beholden to the male gaze.

03:56.418 --> 03:58.885
<i>I used to get
all my exercise</i>

03:58.887 --> 04:01.287
<i>taking my dog Pickles on walks.</i>

04:01.289 --> 04:04.801
<i>Then one day, Pickles
started slowing down a little.</i>

04:04.812 --> 04:07.994
<i>By the end of that walk, he was dead.</i>

04:07.996 --> 04:09.629
That escalated so fast.

04:09.631 --> 04:12.298
<i>Without Pickles,
I couldn't leave the house.</i>

04:12.300 --> 04:15.568
<i>In two months, I gained 100 pounds.</i>

04:15.570 --> 04:17.837
<i>But then I heard about Lumps...</i>

04:17.839 --> 04:20.005
<i>a no-impact workout for women...</i>

04:20.007 --> 04:21.673
<i>and it saved my life.</i>

04:21.676 --> 04:25.445
Oh, come on. Who's gonna fall
for this manipulative nonsense?

04:27.282 --> 04:29.115
Who's walking Pickles
in heaven?

04:29.117 --> 04:30.917
Do you think it's Princess Diana?

04:30.919 --> 04:33.219
Guys, listen, my dad
wanted Champions

04:33.221 --> 04:35.822
to be a welcoming place
to work out for men and women.

04:35.824 --> 04:37.857
Just yesterday, I caught up
with Mrs. Harrington.

04:37.859 --> 04:40.226
She has been a member
for over 30 years...

04:40.228 --> 04:42.095
Dana, I told you not to raise your hand.

04:42.097 --> 04:43.596
It's weird. Just interrupt me.

04:43.598 --> 04:46.215
Okay, I hate to burst your bubble,
but Mrs. Harrington quit today.

04:46.226 --> 04:48.468
- Huh?
- To join Lumps.

04:50.272 --> 04:51.805
What?

04:52.669 --> 04:55.548
Guys, this is a minor hiccup,
all right?

04:55.559 --> 04:58.430
We just need to ask ourselves
what would Dad do?

04:58.441 --> 05:00.830
Get drunk and pray to
his picture of JFK?

05:00.841 --> 05:02.674
My ears were burning.

05:02.676 --> 05:05.143
Were you guys discussing
the needs of middle-ages women?

05:05.145 --> 05:07.160
I'm an expert from observing mother.

05:07.171 --> 05:09.438
Hey, don't call Priya
middle-aged.

05:09.449 --> 05:11.674
I'm the same age. It's normal age.

05:11.685 --> 05:13.652
- Everyone else is the wrong age.
- Oh, okay.

05:13.654 --> 05:16.824
Well, here's a tip, maybe not every
TV has to be playing sports.

05:16.835 --> 05:18.457
My mom only goes to the gym

05:18.459 --> 05:20.125
to sit on a treadmill and watch Bravo.

05:20.127 --> 05:21.564
Okay, well, I'm pretty sure

05:21.575 --> 05:24.263
gyms in New York are just a little
bit different than gyms in Ohio.

05:24.265 --> 05:26.009
Like, what's Bravo?

05:26.020 --> 05:27.415
Also, shouldn't you be doing math?

05:27.426 --> 05:29.756
Uh, I am doing the math
and your business model

05:29.767 --> 05:31.475
- does not add up.
- How about we start

05:31.486 --> 05:33.802
by putting tampons
in the tampon machines.

05:33.804 --> 05:35.804
I put in a quarter
and a spider came out.

05:35.806 --> 05:38.874
If a woman's having her special time,
she shouldn't be in a gym anyway.

05:38.876 --> 05:40.809
She should be at home
with a hot water bottle

05:40.811 --> 05:43.045
watching Julie Chen on "The Talk."

05:43.047 --> 05:46.582
- That is so sexist.
- Hey, I'm not sexist at all.

05:46.584 --> 05:49.885
All lives matter... chicks,
dudes, gender confusos.

05:49.887 --> 05:51.620
Okay, you know what?

05:51.622 --> 05:53.656
Champions has survived
all the trends, right?

05:53.658 --> 05:56.425
Jazzercise, step aerobics, that one
year everyone just did cocaine.

05:56.427 --> 05:58.627
- Yeah, 2012!
- Yeah, 1983.

05:58.629 --> 06:00.763
Yeah, so we can change,
we'll get a few customers.

06:00.765 --> 06:02.197
But we're gonna lose our base.

06:02.199 --> 06:03.732
Yeah, and your dad would stop new gyms

06:03.734 --> 06:05.467
from poaching our members by giving them

06:05.469 --> 06:07.503
- the old Irish hello.
- An Irish hello...

06:07.505 --> 06:09.638
is that when you flash someone
on St. Patrick's Day?

06:09.640 --> 06:12.204
What? Dude, it's when you
go visit a new gym owner

06:12.215 --> 06:14.513
and you agree not to steal customers.
We're gonna do that.

06:14.524 --> 06:16.578
So you're not gonna change
anything about the gym.

06:16.580 --> 06:19.648
Yeah, Vince, I mean, why not just
try a few female-friendly upgrades.

06:19.650 --> 06:21.517
Matthew, Vince has
made up his mind.

06:21.519 --> 06:22.885
- Thank you.
- We are dropping everything

06:22.887 --> 06:24.320
and we are going to Lumps.

06:24.322 --> 06:26.755
Let me just grab my pashmina
and I'll be right there.

06:26.757 --> 06:28.857
No, Matthew and I
are gonna be going, okay?

06:28.859 --> 06:30.576
You have math to do and you're
not gonna go anywhere

06:30.587 --> 06:32.261
until you are a beautiful mind.

06:32.263 --> 06:35.197
Uh... the movie that took
the Oscar from "Moulin Rouge!"?

06:35.199 --> 06:37.833
- How dare you.
- Okay. Dana, come on.

06:37.835 --> 06:42.104
So Dana, you've been asking for
a raise for a couple weeks now.

06:42.106 --> 06:43.772
And you're giving it to me?

06:43.774 --> 06:45.507
Vince, this is amazing.

06:45.509 --> 06:48.210
My boyfriend Asher and I have
been trying to move in together.

06:48.212 --> 06:50.045
He's an aspiring
screenwriter and he needs

06:50.047 --> 06:52.047
an extra bedroom to be alone
with his characters.

06:52.049 --> 06:53.916
Oh, I forgot
you have a boyfriend.

06:53.918 --> 06:55.818
You just look so single.

06:55.820 --> 06:59.421
Excuse me? Name one thing about
me that makes me look single.

06:59.423 --> 07:02.057
Oh, easy. Your cardigans,
your close-toed shoes...

07:02.059 --> 07:03.965
Oh, the way you always
bring a salad from home.

07:03.976 --> 07:06.829
I don't always bring a salad from home.
Sometimes they are leftovers

07:06.831 --> 07:10.432
from... a restaurant.

07:10.434 --> 07:11.967
Just tell me how much my raise is.

07:11.969 --> 07:14.737
Well, it's actually, uh...
it's better than a raise.

07:14.739 --> 07:18.006
Okay? Because you're gonna
be earning it by working more

07:18.008 --> 07:21.176
tutoring an at-risk minority youth.

07:21.178 --> 07:23.645
Oh, no.
I have to teach your kid math?

07:23.647 --> 07:25.948
Oh, no. I have to do math
with this nobody?

07:25.950 --> 07:27.549
I'm... I'm sorry,
just a second ago

07:27.551 --> 07:29.661
you desperately needed money
to move in with Asher.

07:29.672 --> 07:32.388
Or is his unemployment
more lucrative than we thought?

07:32.390 --> 07:34.056
Forget it.
I will teach your kid math.

07:34.058 --> 07:35.557
Great.
Um, eight bucks an hour?

07:35.559 --> 07:38.694
And you're gonna have to show me
how to deduct that off my taxes.

07:45.403 --> 07:47.269
Look at all the quotes
on the wall.

07:47.271 --> 07:50.002
"Every Mother is Also
a Daughter," Tyne Daly.

07:50.013 --> 07:52.674
Wow. It's like living
in Mom's Facebook page.

07:52.676 --> 07:54.810
Why doesn't Champions
have quotes on the walls?

07:54.812 --> 07:58.451
We do. "No Spitting on
the Treadmill," Vince Cook.

07:58.462 --> 08:00.006
Maureen, Code Blue.

08:00.017 --> 08:01.658
There's a him in the gym.

08:01.669 --> 08:04.193
Oh, you know what? It's okay.
It's under control. And you know,

08:04.204 --> 08:05.854
why don't you move to the next station?

08:05.865 --> 08:08.124
I think you're ready to move up
to half-pound weights.

08:08.135 --> 08:09.925
Yeah, you go.

08:09.927 --> 08:12.227
Oh, hi. So you must be
the Champions boys.

08:12.229 --> 08:13.695
- Hi, I'm Maureen.
- Hi.

08:13.697 --> 08:15.230
I'm Lumps'
tri-state area manager.

08:15.232 --> 08:17.065
It's so nice to finally meet you.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.834
Why don't we go to my office
and we can chat?

08:18.836 --> 08:20.903
Come on, sweethearts. Let's go.

08:20.905 --> 08:24.506
So in a right triangle,
the square of the hypotenuse

08:24.508 --> 08:27.810
is equivalent to the sum of the
squares of the short sides.

08:27.812 --> 08:29.545
Dana, come on.

08:29.547 --> 08:32.313
Okay, let's just ease into this
with a little chit chat.

08:32.316 --> 08:34.582
Tell me about Asher.
Are you going to get married?

08:34.585 --> 08:35.851
You're like 50, right?

08:35.852 --> 08:39.121
Why is everyone obsessed
with Asher and I getting married?

08:39.123 --> 08:41.123
You, my mom, Asher's ex.

08:41.125 --> 08:43.292
It's perfectly normal
to date someone for 12 years.

08:43.294 --> 08:44.560
Are you a freshman at Berkeley?

08:44.562 --> 08:45.928
Because you protest too much.

08:45.930 --> 08:47.663
Are you a freshman
in high school?

08:47.665 --> 08:51.066
Because you are four feet tall
and about to get beat up.

08:51.068 --> 08:52.935
I admire what
you do here, Maureen.

08:52.937 --> 08:55.437
For a woman of your age
to run this place,

08:55.439 --> 08:57.473
it's a heartwarming success story

08:57.475 --> 08:59.374
and you should be proud of yourself.

09:01.445 --> 09:03.011
But, uh... and the problem is

09:03.013 --> 09:05.547
you've been poaching some of our clients

09:05.549 --> 09:07.076
and you probably don't even mean to,

09:07.087 --> 09:08.750
but that's just not how we do things

09:08.752 --> 09:10.185
- in this neighborhood.
- Uh-huh.

09:10.187 --> 09:12.193
Do you know what capitalism is?

09:12.204 --> 09:13.217
- Of course.
- Yeah.

09:13.228 --> 09:15.858
It's when you press shift on the
keyboard to make the letter big.

09:15.860 --> 09:18.560
It's survival of the
fittest but in business.

09:18.562 --> 09:20.562
Your members are leaving because I offer

09:20.564 --> 09:22.364
a better product for a better price.

09:22.366 --> 09:25.133
Poaching? No, that's what I do in Africa

09:25.135 --> 09:27.769
on my vacations
with my much younger husband.

09:27.771 --> 09:31.940
Uh, no this isn't about
business, okay, or price points.

09:31.942 --> 09:35.544
This is America and capitalism
doesn't apply to mom and pops.

09:35.546 --> 09:38.046
Mom and pop. That's an
interesting term, isn't it?

09:38.048 --> 09:39.481
One can almost say it's a folksy way

09:39.483 --> 09:42.050
of describing a business
that's not successful

09:42.052 --> 09:43.151
enough to franchise.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.053
Lady, we're very successful.

09:45.055 --> 09:47.389
We just successfully
fought off a rat infestation,

09:47.391 --> 09:49.358
- so...
- You did? Okay, you know what?

09:49.360 --> 09:50.567
Here's what's going on:

09:50.578 --> 09:52.961
You think because
I'm a 63-year-old woman

09:52.963 --> 09:54.963
in a blush-colored velour track suit

09:54.965 --> 09:56.465
that you can tell me what to do.

09:56.467 --> 09:57.799
- Yeah. Is that okay?
- No.

09:57.801 --> 09:59.868
And now I'm gonna offer every woman

09:59.870 --> 10:02.838
at Champions a free
one-month membership.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.373
'Cause I feel so bad for them.

10:04.375 --> 10:05.707
You know what? Screw it.

10:05.709 --> 10:07.209
A year membership.

10:07.211 --> 10:09.690
Hey, that's not fair. You know
we can't compete with that.

10:09.701 --> 10:12.272
Yeah, our dad died
when we were young... ish.

10:12.283 --> 10:13.649
- Feel bad for us!
- You know what?

10:13.651 --> 10:16.985
Time is up and I've gotta go. I
have a very important appointment.

10:23.675 --> 10:26.507
So the old Irish hello backfired
and Lumps has declared war.

10:26.518 --> 10:28.007
We need female members now.

10:28.018 --> 10:29.854
Yeah, we gotta just
grab 'em off the street.

10:29.865 --> 10:30.901
Should we get a van?

10:30.912 --> 10:33.417
How about we just try to make
Champions more female-friendly?

10:33.428 --> 10:35.509
Like, maybe no ugly pervs
in my yoga class?

10:35.511 --> 10:37.945
Britney! Ugly pervs
is all we've got left.

10:37.947 --> 10:39.346
Look, I got a two-prong plan.

10:39.348 --> 10:41.515
Britney, Shabaz, Matthew,

10:41.517 --> 10:43.550
I need you to recruit
every middle-aged woman

10:43.552 --> 10:45.166
in Brooklyn into a long-term contract

10:45.177 --> 10:46.358
before Lumps finds them.

10:46.369 --> 10:47.855
And how, pray tell, are we supposed to

10:47.857 --> 10:51.191
- get these women to suddenly join up?
- I don't know! Give 'em a free t-shirt.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.960
Tell 'em they can
control the thermostat.

10:52.962 --> 10:54.862
I'll tell you where
you can find older women.

10:54.864 --> 10:56.964
Yankee Candle,
the return line at Kohl's,

10:56.966 --> 11:00.396
matinees for the new Nancy
Meyers movie, "She Can't Even."

11:00.407 --> 11:02.065
- Should I continue?
- Michael, I told you

11:02.076 --> 11:03.737
I got this, and what are you doing here?

11:03.739 --> 11:05.128
- Where's Dana?
- Sorry, sorry.

11:05.139 --> 11:07.633
I took a call from Asher and then
when I came back he was gone.

11:07.644 --> 11:10.484
- I thought I locked the door.
- You didn't lock the air vent, sweetie.

11:10.495 --> 11:12.446
Okay, prong two:
infiltration.

11:12.448 --> 11:14.514
We go under cover
to find out their secrets.

11:14.516 --> 11:16.281
So we just need to
send in our best actor.

11:16.292 --> 11:19.019
Okay. Well, uh,
thank you for the opportunity.

11:19.021 --> 11:21.154
This is the role of a lifetime.

11:21.156 --> 11:23.624
- And I accept.
- I'll do it.

11:23.626 --> 11:26.460
I went undercover for years
as an all-state hammer thrower

11:26.462 --> 11:28.161
who wasn't on steroids.

11:28.163 --> 11:29.596
Ruby, you are hired.

11:29.598 --> 11:32.032
Let's get to work. And with any luck,

11:32.034 --> 11:36.136
we're about to take down the
neighborhood safe space for women.

11:36.138 --> 11:38.572
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

11:38.574 --> 11:41.208
Come on!
I thought I had that one.

11:41.210 --> 11:42.976
I asked you to define acute
and you wrote,

11:42.978 --> 11:44.778
"Jake Gyllenhaal circa 1999."

11:44.780 --> 11:47.948
Watch "October Sky"
and then tell me I'm wrong.

11:49.285 --> 11:51.485
It's Asher.

11:54.657 --> 11:56.189
"Hey, canceled the realtor.

11:56.191 --> 11:58.914
Not sure I'm ready
to move in together. Cool?"

11:59.595 --> 12:02.930
Oh, Dana. I'm so sorry.

12:02.932 --> 12:05.232
It's not that bad, right?

12:06.468 --> 12:09.436
I don't wanna pass judgment
without knowing all the facts.

12:09.438 --> 12:11.571
Tell me everything.

12:11.573 --> 12:12.673
Fine, okay.

12:12.675 --> 12:14.775
Um, I had to cosign for his car.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.978
It's just really expensive and I was
the only one that had credit, so...

12:17.980 --> 12:20.113
- That's horrible.
- Yeah.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.415
Go on.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.183
So what brings you
in here, hm?

12:23.185 --> 12:25.119
Are you one of the many women
in the neighborhood

12:25.130 --> 12:28.121
- disenchanted with Champions?
- Yes, I am

12:28.123 --> 12:30.257
a heterosexual mother

12:30.259 --> 12:32.059
who needs to get in shape

12:32.061 --> 12:36.496
because my male husband
no longer finds me alluring.

12:36.498 --> 12:39.967
Darling, your husband
sounds like a grade A fool.

12:39.969 --> 12:41.168
Oh, he is.

12:41.170 --> 12:43.303
Always burping and scratching his butt,

12:43.305 --> 12:45.372
reading my "Playboys."
Well, here,

12:45.374 --> 12:46.773
there are no husbands.

12:46.775 --> 12:48.760
Just a strong group of women
in comfortable jeans

12:48.771 --> 12:50.775
- I can't wait for you to meet them.
- Cool!

12:50.786 --> 12:53.213
You know, we can talk about, um...

12:53.215 --> 12:55.749
uh, nail polish or Josh Groban.

12:55.751 --> 12:58.251
He is the only male artist
that we play in here.

12:58.253 --> 13:00.287
What?
That's crazy.

13:00.289 --> 13:02.489
I know. Listen, let's get
your paperwork started.

13:04.000 --> 13:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:18.736 --> 13:19.873
Where are the new clients?

13:19.875 --> 13:22.275
Ohh! I knew I was
forgetting something.

13:22.277 --> 13:23.744
These candles are so great.

13:23.746 --> 13:26.081
One of them smelled so good, I bit it.

13:32.755 --> 13:34.287
I've been working out

13:34.289 --> 13:36.990
for two hours, and I haven't
even broken a sweat.

13:36.992 --> 13:40.260
- Great job, Ruby.
- No! Terrible job.

13:40.262 --> 13:41.995
Okay, Ruby.
How are you enjoying

13:41.997 --> 13:45.165
- your first week at Lumps?
- This place stoinks.

13:45.167 --> 13:46.767
I'm not getting the body I want.

13:46.769 --> 13:50.103
Maybe some other gyms
have a more satisfying workout

13:50.105 --> 13:52.339
- with a cool local flare.
- You know,

13:52.341 --> 13:54.207
I remember that frustration,

13:54.209 --> 13:58.445
being obsessed about what the
magazines told me to look like.

13:58.447 --> 14:00.313
I guess I do feel like crap
after I read.

14:00.315 --> 14:02.049
"Russian Weight Lifters Monthly."

14:02.051 --> 14:03.683
I could never squat a school bus.

14:03.685 --> 14:05.986
No, maybe the weight
you actually need to lift

14:05.988 --> 14:07.220
is off your shoulders.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.689
Take a look. Can you read that for me?

14:10.295 --> 14:11.495
"I'm perfect."

14:11.506 --> 14:13.794
Now for the people
in the cheap seats.

14:13.796 --> 14:16.503
"I'm perfect!"
Whoa.

14:16.865 --> 14:18.665
- That's about me.
- Yes.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.301
I'm perfect. I'm perfect!

14:21.303 --> 14:23.804
Do you hear that, bitches? I'm perfect!

14:23.806 --> 14:26.667
- I win! You lose!
- Okay, no, no, no, no, no.

14:26.678 --> 14:28.141
We're all perfect We're all perfect.

14:28.143 --> 14:29.376
- Oh.
- Okay, you know what?

14:29.378 --> 14:32.913
We had a breakthrough
and you know what that means.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.148
Massage train!

14:35.150 --> 14:37.684
All right!

14:37.686 --> 14:40.387
Vince, sorry to interrupt, but
you have to watch this video.

14:40.389 --> 14:41.521
I...

14:41.523 --> 14:44.825
<i>At my old gym, I was just
so angry all the time.</i>

14:44.827 --> 14:47.027
<i>The people I surrounded myself
with were...</i>

14:47.029 --> 14:49.329
<i>for lack of a better word... losers.</i>

14:49.331 --> 14:51.331
Think she could've
found a better word?

14:51.333 --> 14:52.899
Scrappy underdogs? Working poor?

14:52.901 --> 14:54.367
<i>But ever since</i>

14:54.369 --> 14:56.002
<i>I've been coming to Lumps,</i>

14:56.004 --> 14:57.219
<i>I've found peace.</i>

14:57.230 --> 14:59.072
<i>With the support of the gals here,</i>

14:59.074 --> 15:02.509
<i>I feel like the goddess
I always dreamed of being,</i>

15:02.511 --> 15:05.879
<i>which is why I'm not
only a member of Lumps,</i>

15:05.881 --> 15:08.448
<i>I'm now a trainer.</i>

15:08.450 --> 15:09.696
What are we gonna do?

15:09.707 --> 15:11.766
Ruby was the heart and soul
and pecs of this place.

15:11.777 --> 15:13.519
I thought Ruby loved
our aggro environment.

15:13.530 --> 15:16.656
Vince, I've been telling you, this place
has been getting a little too intense.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.059
Too intense?! Okay, I
don't see that at all.

15:19.061 --> 15:21.628
Okay, everybody shut up!

15:23.899 --> 15:25.465
Asher? What are you
doing here?

15:25.467 --> 15:27.033
I'm looking
for Michael Patel.

15:27.035 --> 15:29.302
I'm gonna kick his ass.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.071
That's Michael? This guy's
trying to steal my boo?

15:36.082 --> 15:38.492
He's straight-up Stewart Little.

15:38.503 --> 15:41.953
Oh, honey. The only things
I steal are... scenes.

15:41.955 --> 15:44.022
Okay. What exactly
gave you the impression

15:44.024 --> 15:46.858
that Dana was cheating on you
with a gay teenager?

15:46.860 --> 15:49.027
Well, she was
always texting me,

15:49.029 --> 15:51.062
"Michael says my outfit looks fierce."

15:51.064 --> 15:52.830
"Michael thinks I should
break up with you."

15:52.841 --> 15:55.733
Hair flip emoji... and now that I'm
saying it, I missed some clues.

15:55.735 --> 15:57.202
Well, Dana should break up with you.

15:57.204 --> 15:58.937
You say you wanna move in,
then you don't.

15:58.939 --> 16:01.426
You're hot, then you're cold.
You're yes, then you're no.

16:01.437 --> 16:03.608
Sorry, I didn't think we
should move in together

16:03.610 --> 16:04.909
unless we were gonna get married.

16:04.911 --> 16:06.544
And then I thought about losing you

16:06.546 --> 16:07.946
and our shared HBO NOW account

16:07.948 --> 16:10.448
and I realized I do wanna live with you.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.917
Wait, but if you only
wanna live with someone

16:12.919 --> 16:16.654
that you're gonna marry and you
wanna move in with me then...

16:16.656 --> 16:18.490
Then by
the transitive property,

16:18.492 --> 16:19.824
you wanna marry Dana someday?

16:19.826 --> 16:22.927
Oh, my God. I know math now.

16:22.929 --> 16:26.564
That's so great. Now Michael can be
our accountant and we can fire Dana.

16:26.566 --> 16:28.666
Wait, Asher, is that true?

16:28.668 --> 16:30.428
Do you wanna marry me?

16:31.104 --> 16:32.980
Sure, sure.

16:32.991 --> 16:35.840
We could definitely talk about that.

16:35.842 --> 16:38.743
Or... maybe we shouldn't.

16:38.745 --> 16:40.612
But, hey! We can wrestle with it.

16:40.614 --> 16:41.846
- Yes.
- Yeah, maybe somewhere

16:41.848 --> 16:44.115
that's not the floor of an all-male gym?

16:44.117 --> 16:45.917
All-male gym?

16:45.919 --> 16:47.619
There's women here.
Open your eyes, dude.

16:47.621 --> 16:49.587
No, man. It's all dudes.

16:49.589 --> 16:52.357
It's like a Congressional panel
for women's health out there.

16:52.359 --> 16:55.026
Come one, babe. Let's go.

16:55.028 --> 16:57.996
The course of true love
never did run smooth.

16:57.998 --> 17:00.765
I read that on an ad
for chunky peanut butter.

17:00.767 --> 17:03.034
You. Upstairs, now.

17:05.031 --> 17:07.559
Michael, you're not supposed
to be trying to fix Dana's many,

17:07.569 --> 17:10.137
many relationship problems. You're
supposed to be learning math.

17:10.147 --> 17:11.559
Why do I have to care about math?

17:11.569 --> 17:14.394
I should be spending that time on
useful classes like stage combat

17:14.405 --> 17:15.613
or award season networking.

17:15.615 --> 17:17.015
How is your school accredited?

17:17.017 --> 17:18.650
Every time you tell me I need to

17:18.652 --> 17:21.152
work harder on math, I hear,
"I don't believe

17:21.154 --> 17:23.198
in my son's talent."

17:23.623 --> 17:25.823
Hey, look,
you're so talented.

17:25.825 --> 17:27.559
And I was talented at baseball,

17:27.560 --> 17:29.360
but then life threw me a curveball.

17:29.362 --> 17:31.729
- You see, a curveball...
- Yeah, I know.

17:31.731 --> 17:34.132
It's a pitch that's hard to hit.
I'm gay, not foreign.

17:34.134 --> 17:35.967
Luckily, my dad made me
focus on school,

17:35.969 --> 17:37.802
so that when baseball didn't work out,

17:37.804 --> 17:40.305
- I had the skills to run the gym.
- Hm. That's interesting.

17:40.307 --> 17:41.973
'Cause you're terrible
at running the gym.

17:41.975 --> 17:43.708
Terrible at
running the gym?

17:43.710 --> 17:45.009
Come on, that's not fair.

17:45.011 --> 17:46.609
Okay, he's average at running the gym.

17:46.620 --> 17:48.195
Champions is a symptom of our society's

17:48.206 --> 17:50.048
complete rejection of women over 40.

17:50.050 --> 17:51.916
If it weren't for gay men,
older women would be

17:51.918 --> 17:54.586
- marched to their deaths.
- That's a little dramatic.

17:54.588 --> 17:58.856
Oh, really? What was the last Judi
Dench movie you've seen her in?

17:58.858 --> 18:01.025
- "Harry Potter."
- Uh... she is literally

18:01.027 --> 18:03.695
the only British person
not in a "Harry Potter" movie.

18:03.697 --> 18:06.264
You are so obsessed with doing
everything your dad's way.

18:06.266 --> 18:08.366
But would your dad want
the gym to close?

18:08.368 --> 18:09.734
Yeah, Michael's right.

18:09.736 --> 18:11.069
Dad didn't always fear change.

18:11.071 --> 18:12.852
Remember that one summer
he watched "Roots"

18:12.863 --> 18:14.709
and realized we need
to find some black members

18:14.720 --> 18:16.060
so we could talk
about "Roots" with someone.

18:16.071 --> 18:17.775
Yeah, I'd forgotten
he did that.

18:17.777 --> 18:19.377
And it explains the shirtless photo

18:19.379 --> 18:21.133
of the "Reading Rainbow" guy
on the wall in our gym.

18:21.144 --> 18:22.714
- Mm.
- Okay, so maybe Champions

18:22.716 --> 18:24.415
could use some change.

18:24.417 --> 18:26.384
And maybe you could help.

18:26.386 --> 18:28.286
I mean, I wouldn't even
know where to start.

18:28.288 --> 18:30.555
Tear down all the walls.
Glass everywhere.

18:30.557 --> 18:33.224
We don't open until midnight.
Calvin Harris DJs.

18:33.226 --> 18:35.593
We have no sign.
Our address constantly changes.

18:35.595 --> 18:36.628
- Stripper poles.
- Yeah.

18:36.630 --> 18:38.396
This is gonna be great.

18:38.398 --> 18:39.631
<i>Hey, guys, listen up.</i>

18:39.633 --> 18:41.099
I made a few changes around here

18:41.101 --> 18:43.067
to make Champions a little more
female friendly.

18:43.069 --> 18:44.636
For instance, Britney,

18:44.638 --> 18:47.071
I filled the tampon machine
with tampons.

18:47.073 --> 18:49.407
Thank you for doing
the bare minimum.

18:49.409 --> 18:51.943
- It is more than I expected.
- That's not all.

18:51.945 --> 18:55.546
Also added some all-female
classes to the schedule.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.749
Cardi B cardio is a go.

18:57.751 --> 18:59.317
- Cardi B? Really?
- Yeah.

18:59.319 --> 19:01.953
Thank you. And don't worry,
I'll use the censored version

19:01.955 --> 19:04.088
of her music... though it is
more bleep than song.

19:04.090 --> 19:05.490
- Yeah.
- Actually, most of these

19:05.492 --> 19:06.891
were Michael's ideas.

19:06.893 --> 19:11.734
So we now have a TV that is
dedicated solely to "SVU" reruns.

19:12.298 --> 19:14.132
How's it going, Mrs. H? Welcome back.

19:14.134 --> 19:16.300
My niece was the body
in this one.

19:16.302 --> 19:17.935
Oh, cool.

19:17.937 --> 19:20.405
Hey, everybody.

19:20.407 --> 19:22.273
It's me. I, uh...

19:22.275 --> 19:23.775
finished my undercover mission.

19:23.777 --> 19:27.145
Yeah, nice try. We saw your testimonial.
You loved it there.

19:27.147 --> 19:29.113
No, I went in too deep.

19:29.115 --> 19:30.615
Like Donnie Brasco.

19:30.617 --> 19:32.784
Some days I'd wake up
and not even know who I was.

19:32.786 --> 19:36.120
Mm-hmm.
So why'd they kick you out?

19:36.122 --> 19:38.489
I told Maureen
to pull my finger.

19:38.491 --> 19:40.625
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll just put it this way:

19:40.627 --> 19:42.126
she pulled too hard.

19:42.128 --> 19:45.129
But you know what? One thing I
will thank those soccer moms for

19:45.131 --> 19:47.331
is giving me a sense of confidence.

19:47.342 --> 19:49.194
You're the most confident
person I've ever met.

19:50.670 --> 19:52.970
You guys ain't seen nothin' yet.

19:52.972 --> 19:55.807
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm
gonna go shake some snacks

19:55.809 --> 19:57.155
out of the vending machine.

19:57.166 --> 19:59.844
Any orders? No? Okay.

19:59.846 --> 20:02.013
- Oh, "SVU." Sweet.
- Yeah.

20:02.015 --> 20:05.850
More like Mariska Hardbody.

20:05.852 --> 20:07.309
<i>- All right, cool, thanks.
- Okay.</i>

20:07.320 --> 20:09.121
Hey, don't take this the wrong way,

20:09.132 --> 20:11.656
but I don't think you tutoring
Michael's working out.

20:11.658 --> 20:13.491
Oh. That's too bad.

20:13.493 --> 20:15.059
He was really keeping Asher on his toes.

20:15.061 --> 20:16.527
Right.

20:16.529 --> 20:19.630
Last night he brought me a dozen
carnations and left the price tag on.

20:19.632 --> 20:21.684
- $7.
- Whoo. Not bad.

20:21.695 --> 20:23.301
Uh, so here's what I was thinking.

20:23.303 --> 20:25.503
Uh, I pay you to teach me math

20:25.505 --> 20:27.138
then I teach Michael.

20:27.140 --> 20:29.340
Okay. As long as
I'm still getting paid.

20:29.342 --> 20:32.844
Great. Okay, so, um,
beginner's geometry.

20:32.846 --> 20:34.245
Seems pretty easy.

20:34.247 --> 20:36.145
It's just, like,
naming shapes and stuff, right?

20:36.156 --> 20:37.482
Circles, squares, what not.

20:37.484 --> 20:39.364
Um, actually, we're doing
Pythagorean theorem.

20:39.375 --> 20:41.753
So it's A squared plus
B squared equals C squared.

20:41.755 --> 20:44.355
That sounds pretty hard. So I'm just
gonna tell Michael to cheat.

20:44.357 --> 20:45.590
- Cool?
- Uh, you know what?

20:45.592 --> 20:47.864
Let's just ease back into it.

20:47.875 --> 20:50.394
Let's sit down and maybe you wanna

20:50.396 --> 20:52.530
just go back to naming some shapes.

20:52.532 --> 20:53.831
- I can name shapes.
- All right.

20:53.833 --> 20:54.866
- I know shapes.
- Okay.

20:54.868 --> 20:56.601
Rectangles, star,

20:56.603 --> 20:57.835
- snowman.
- Well...

20:57.837 --> 20:59.537
- Oh! Triangle.
- Yes.

20:59.539 --> 21:01.339
Um, hexagon, octagon...

21:02.876 --> 21:05.376
decathlon, diamond,
rhombus, six-point star,

21:05.378 --> 21:07.257
spiral, cube, um, acute triangle.
