00:20.938 --> 00:22.356
Dear Miss Dickinson,

00:22.439 --> 00:27.110
Your writing gives the impression
of a wholly new and original poetry.

00:27.194 --> 00:31.240
"Wholly new and original."

00:34.910 --> 00:36.161
My poetry's not dead.

00:37.120 --> 00:38.664
It's not dead. It's alive!

00:53.345 --> 00:57.307
Vinnie! Vinnie! You won't believe this.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.310
I just got a letter
from Thomas Wentworth Higginson.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.813
Do you know who he is?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.482
Okay. He's amazing, Vinnie.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.485
He's-- He's an abolitionist
and a minister,

01:08.569 --> 01:10.237
and he writes essays for The Atlantic.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.532
He's a freethinker, Vinnie, an activist,

01:13.615 --> 01:16.451
a person who really cares about
making the world a better place,

01:16.535 --> 01:18.161
and guess what?

01:18.245 --> 01:19.496
He likes my poems.

01:21.331 --> 01:23.041
He asked me to send more.

01:23.125 --> 01:27.254
I may not be able to go to war myself,
but maybe, by learning from this man,

01:27.337 --> 01:30.174
I can write poems
that actually matter to people.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.800
Poems that can help.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.931
Why aren't you saying anything?

01:41.685 --> 01:45.480
Right. You took a vow of silence
in solidarity with the troops.

01:47.191 --> 01:49.610
You know, Lavinia,
you're really pushing boundaries

01:49.693 --> 01:52.487
with your durational performance art.
You're getting pretty avant-garde.

02:34.530 --> 02:38.033
Please, look with your eyes,
not with your hands.

02:38.116 --> 02:39.743
-The stitching is so intricate.
-Yeah.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.954
It's how we get
all the secret messages in there.

02:42.037 --> 02:43.080
Wait. What?

02:44.581 --> 02:47.876
Wow. America's been a country
for less than 100 years,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.170
and it thinks it invented quilting?

02:50.254 --> 02:51.296
Go off, I guess.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.799
-Hi, Emily. Hi, Lavinia.
-Hi.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.301
Lavinia is not speaking today.

02:56.385 --> 02:59.096
She's taken a vow of silence
as an homage to our fallen men.

03:00.097 --> 03:01.139
Hello, Lavinia.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.644
So, you guys see anything you like?

03:05.727 --> 03:09.106
That's… It's very small. Is it for a baby?

03:09.189 --> 03:10.357
Yeah.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.317
A feminist baby.

03:12.401 --> 03:13.694
Wow. Okay.

03:16.864 --> 03:20.450
Oh, my God. Look at Betty's quilts.
They're gorgeous.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.453
Thank you.
Happy to raise money for the cause.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.080
These squares don't match.

03:25.664 --> 03:28.667
They're all different shapes and sizes.
It's not symmetrical.

03:28.750 --> 03:31.587
What's going on here?
This quilt makes no sense.

03:31.670 --> 03:33.255
Art doesn't have to make sense.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.381
She's a genius.

03:34.464 --> 03:35.883
-I'm buying it.
-I was here first.

03:37.384 --> 03:38.385
Thanks.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.180
Guess what? I took your advice.

03:41.263 --> 03:42.264
What advice?

03:42.347 --> 03:45.184
I wrote a letter to the world,
and the world wrote me back.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.894
Well, there you go.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.326
Edward, does it feel like
people are staring at us?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.243
No.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.287
Maybe a bit.

04:06.246 --> 04:09.166
I'm getting a lot of disapproving energy
from these townspeople.

04:10.042 --> 04:11.543
It's time for the auction.

04:11.627 --> 04:13.795
I donated Grandmother Norcross's quilt.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.714
I'm sure it'll fetch a pretty penny.

04:15.797 --> 04:18.091
We'll start the bidding for this
at five dollars.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.010
I beg your pardon?

04:20.511 --> 04:23.889
My mother won
the 1822 Monson quilting bee's blue ribbon

04:23.972 --> 04:24.973
with that piece.

04:25.057 --> 04:26.350
It's only a starting bid.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.937
The buyers will determine the value
of your donation, Mrs. Dickinson.

04:30.020 --> 04:31.313
Well, that's not fair.

04:31.396 --> 04:33.273
That's literally how auctions work.

04:33.857 --> 04:37.694
Five dollars for my family heirloom?
That's outrageous.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.987
No.

04:39.071 --> 04:41.907
I'm sorry. I-- I've decided
I'm not selling it. Give it back.

04:41.990 --> 04:44.660
I-- I thought you wanted to support
the troops, Mrs. Dickinson.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.119
Well, of course I do.

04:46.203 --> 04:47.663
But my sister just died,

04:47.746 --> 04:50.374
and this quilt is the only thing
I have left to remember her by.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.291
Give it to me.

04:51.375 --> 04:53.836
If you want the quilt back,
you'll have to bid for it.

04:55.462 --> 04:56.588
Edward.

04:56.672 --> 04:57.756
Yes?

04:57.840 --> 04:59.633
I need you to buy this quilt back.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.052
I'm not gonna spend
my hard-earned money on a quilt

05:02.135 --> 05:05.138
that's been sitting in our attic
since we got married, Mrs. Dickinson.

05:05.222 --> 05:08.016
Edward! Family is all that matters.

05:08.100 --> 05:11.603
And this quilt is the only thing I have
left to remind me of my dead sister.

05:11.687 --> 05:12.729
Twenty bucks?

05:12.813 --> 05:13.814
The item is yours.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.148
Oh, thank heavens.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.655
You're making quite a to-do,
Mrs. Dickinson.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.865
-Okay.
-Just--

05:22.948 --> 05:23.991
Dickinson.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.325
Conkey.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.952
I'm surprised to see you here.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.287
Surprised? Why?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.247
This is an important civic event.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.332
Not to mention,
I'm treasurer of the college.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.042
Oh, yes. Of course.

05:34.668 --> 05:38.755
But after your recent letter
to the editor,

05:38.839 --> 05:40.883
I wouldn't have thought
you particularly cared

05:40.966 --> 05:42.467
about supporting our Union soldiers.

05:42.551 --> 05:43.802
I beg your pardon, Ithamar.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.637
Your letter in the paper today, Edward,

05:45.721 --> 05:49.474
in which you offer nothing but praise
and sympathy for the vile Confederates.

05:49.558 --> 05:51.018
I certainly did not.

05:51.101 --> 05:53.270
Yeah, you did! Traitor!

05:54.188 --> 05:55.939
Gerald, come on.

05:59.943 --> 06:04.448
Back in 1850, when you voted in support
of that disgusting Fugitive Slave Act…

06:04.531 --> 06:06.116
-Here we go.
-…I was willing to accept

06:06.200 --> 06:08.785
your justification that you did so
as a compromise

06:08.869 --> 06:10.996
in order to preserve our fragile peace.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.999
But now, with war raging,

06:14.082 --> 06:16.543
claiming the lives of our valiant sons,

06:16.627 --> 06:22.049
you pen this-- this tone-deaf,
equivocating plea for civility,

06:22.132 --> 06:24.301
asking us to listen to both sides.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.385
My God, Edward.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.805
You are an apologist for villainy.
For evil.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.973
How dare you.

06:30.682 --> 06:33.060
I wrote that letter
on behalf of my brother.

06:33.143 --> 06:36.563
Just because he happens to live in Georgia
doesn't make him our enemy.

06:36.647 --> 06:39.900
-It most certainly does!
-That's literally how civil wars work.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.944
-Thank you.
-Your tone was condescending,

06:42.027 --> 06:44.613
and your message was deeply out of step
with the moment.

06:44.696 --> 06:47.574
At worst, you looked like a bigot.
And at best…

06:48.367 --> 06:49.368
Yes?

06:49.451 --> 06:50.285
A fossil.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.414
Well, I turned a year older today,
so I suppose you're right.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.709
Oh, my God. It's your birthday?
Happy birthday!

06:57.793 --> 06:58.836
Happy birthday.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.255
-I didn't know.
-I don't like to make a big deal of it.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.507
He never likes to make a big deal
out of his birthday.

07:03.590 --> 07:09.638
Edward, the time has come
for you to choose a side.

07:13.267 --> 07:16.645
I can't choose sides
against my own family.

07:17.396 --> 07:22.276
Well, then you risk losing your title
as treasurer of this college

07:22.359 --> 07:24.778
and God only knows what else.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.160
You could have had this.

07:39.126 --> 07:41.044
-Dad, are you okay?
-Yeah.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.589
I can't believe
Mr. Conkey just attacked you like that.

07:43.672 --> 07:47.009
-That man has always been drama.
-And on your birthday. God, Dad.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.343
Well, what's the difference?

07:49.261 --> 07:50.596
I'll be dead soon enough.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.478
Everything has been just so hard lately.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.856
We can't let him be sad on his birthday.

08:00.939 --> 08:03.400
Well, what can we do?
I already got him a shoehorn.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.904
-I know. I know.
-What?

08:06.987 --> 08:09.740
We should have
a classic Dickinson sing-along.

08:10.490 --> 08:14.703
Emily, that's a wonderful idea.
We haven't done that for so long.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.414
Yes, we'll light a fire in the parlor.
We'll gather around the piano.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.166
We'll sing all his old favorites.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.667
Yes. That's perfect.

08:20.751 --> 08:22.628
It'll be just like old times,

08:22.711 --> 08:25.506
singing around the fire with you children,
just like when you were young.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.257
You know your dad loves a good sing-along.

08:27.341 --> 08:30.469
Girls, family truly is all we have.

08:30.552 --> 08:31.720
I agree.

08:32.261 --> 08:36.015
This will make Dad so happy
on his birthday, for all of us to sing!

08:37.893 --> 08:39.311
Vinnie.

08:40.437 --> 08:41.980
You can lip-synch?

08:42.063 --> 08:43.690
It's probably for the best, Lavinia.

08:44.733 --> 08:47.486
-Now we only have one more problem.
-What?

08:47.569 --> 08:50.572
Well, we can't have a family sing-along
without the whole family.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.741
What about Austin and Sue?

08:53.325 --> 08:54.826
You mean, you want them to come?

08:55.536 --> 08:58.247
Even if Sue is still not ready
to let you hold the baby?

08:59.331 --> 09:02.543
Family is the only thing that matters.
It's as simple as that.

09:02.626 --> 09:03.710
Mom, you're right.

09:04.336 --> 09:06.547
I will get them to join us tonight.
Leave it to me.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.430
Sue!

09:20.143 --> 09:22.479
Sue. What's wrong?

09:24.398 --> 09:28.318
The baby didn't sleep last night
and he won't stop crying,

09:28.402 --> 09:30.612
and I just am so tired.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.992
I honestly didn't know it was possible
to be this tired. I'm just--

09:35.576 --> 09:38.161
Emily, I don't think I can do this.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.914
But you're doing it, Sue.
You're already doing it.

09:40.998 --> 09:42.958
You're taking great care of your baby.

09:45.836 --> 09:47.129
Sue, where is your baby?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.839
He's with Clara and Anna.

09:48.922 --> 09:50.966
I know,
they're twisted little pyromaniacs,

09:51.049 --> 09:54.094
but I just couldn't listen
to him scream anymore.

09:54.678 --> 09:57.639
Just-- I needed a break. Is that wrong?

09:57.723 --> 09:59.808
No. No, no. Of course not.

09:59.892 --> 10:01.185
Okay.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.854
Sue, listen to me.

10:05.772 --> 10:06.815
I love you.

10:08.692 --> 10:10.444
Well, I wasn't expecting that.

10:10.527 --> 10:13.739
And I love you more than anything
or anyone on Earth,

10:13.822 --> 10:16.909
and you need to know that so deeply
that you never doubt it.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.245
You need to know it in your bones.

10:21.747 --> 10:23.540
And if it takes me telling you
every single day

10:23.624 --> 10:26.001
for it to sink in that deep,
then I'm gonna do that.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.254
Because you are my everything, Sue.

10:29.338 --> 10:30.547
Emily.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.049
I can't live without you,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.801
I can't breathe without you,

10:34.885 --> 10:36.428
and I can't write without you.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.972
Where is this coming from?

10:39.056 --> 10:40.766
It's coming from my dirty little heart.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.272
I feel a lot better.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.525
Well, good. Nurse Emily at your service.

10:49.608 --> 10:52.152
Thank you, nurse.
I think you just saved my life.

10:54.112 --> 10:57.574
We're having a family sing-along tonight
for Dad's birthday.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.618
Will you come and join?

11:00.661 --> 11:02.496
That actually sounds really nice.

11:03.247 --> 11:04.456
I'd love to.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.083
Thank you, Sue.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.004
This family is not complete without you.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.259
Now we just need to convince Austin.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.303
-Don't worry. I'll take care of that.
-You will?

11:18.887 --> 11:22.850
At the end of the day, I'm still his wife.
He has to do what I say.

11:23.517 --> 11:26.812
You might be his wife, but I'm yours.

11:31.775 --> 11:33.819
Oh, God. I think he needs me.

11:33.902 --> 11:34.903
-Go.
-Sorry.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.530
It's okay. I'll see you tonight.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.323
See you.

11:54.381 --> 11:57.259
Safe in their Alabaster Chambers -

11:57.342 --> 11:58.677
Untouched by Morning -

11:58.760 --> 12:00.345
And untouched by noon -

12:00.971 --> 12:03.640
Sleep the meek members
of the Resurrection,

12:04.224 --> 12:07.394
Rafter of Satin and Roof of Stone -

12:09.396 --> 12:13.609
Now, before we dive in,
I'd like to take attendance.

12:13.692 --> 12:15.986
Could you each state your name for me,
please?

12:16.069 --> 12:20.365
And while we're at it, why don't you
tell me a little bit about yourself?

12:20.449 --> 12:21.658
I'll start.

12:23.160 --> 12:24.912
My name is Everett.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.497
I have perfect taste in interior design.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.209
And I don't want to talk about my history,
okay?

12:30.834 --> 12:32.336
I want to talk about my future.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.546
Future where
I can get the hell out of this place.

12:34.630 --> 12:35.881
Yeah.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.509
-Say that. Say that.
-Yeah, dude. Amen.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.844
Have you always lived here?

12:40.928 --> 12:45.098
All of us were born here, except Erasmus.
No-- Nobody know where he come from.

12:45.182 --> 12:46.266
Time is a fiction.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.853
Like any story,
I weave myself in and out of histories.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.564
Occasionally,
I do take the shape of a spider.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.859
Man, you something else, man.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.986
Okay.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.530
And you?

12:59.613 --> 13:00.864
I'm The Wall.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.449
They call me The Wall 'cause I'm big,

13:02.533 --> 13:05.744
but ironically, I'm known for
my strength of character above all else.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.954
You can lean on him.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.205
I'm The Wall.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.498
-Got it.
-Yeah.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.667
Yeah. And what's your name?

13:11.750 --> 13:12.751
Michael Jordan.

13:13.418 --> 13:14.628
Michael River Jordan.

13:14.711 --> 13:17.005
You carry a greatness within you,
Michael Jordan.

13:17.965 --> 13:21.260
One day, stadiums will gather
to watch you dominate.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.345
Erasmus can see the future.

13:23.428 --> 13:27.850
The future and the past coexist,
if you have the eyes to see it.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.726
And that's Black excellence.

13:31.520 --> 13:34.231
Wow. Okay.

13:36.024 --> 13:37.651
You. Do you got a story you want to share?

13:37.734 --> 13:39.278
My name is Soloman.

13:39.361 --> 13:43.448
Used to work in the kitchen here, and I
know a whole bunch of herbs and spices.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.575
So you're a good cook?

13:44.658 --> 13:45.826
I'm an assassin.

13:45.909 --> 13:47.953
I will poison you.
You won't even see it coming.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.372
I will watch out for that.

13:50.455 --> 13:51.748
You can try!

13:56.420 --> 13:59.548
Well, now that we're done with attendance…

13:59.631 --> 14:01.049
Once you know the alphabet,

14:01.133 --> 14:04.469
you'll be able to spell
any word in the English language.

14:04.553 --> 14:05.762
Can I spell, "Where's my gun?"

14:06.930 --> 14:08.348
My man!

14:08.432 --> 14:11.727
Can I spell, "If I'm in your army now,
then give me my weapon"?

14:11.810 --> 14:12.895
Boom.

14:12.978 --> 14:15.022
I thought you was gonna get us
our guns, buckra.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.191
Yeah, didn't you say
you was gonna talk to Higginson?

14:17.274 --> 14:18.692
He said that. How that go?

14:18.775 --> 14:21.361
-Well, I did bring it up with him.
-And what did he say?

14:22.196 --> 14:24.740
He said, "It's in process."

14:24.823 --> 14:28.202
"It's in process." What does that mean?

14:28.785 --> 14:29.912
Well, according to Higginson,

14:29.995 --> 14:34.082
the First South Carolina Volunteers
is still a bit of an experiment.

14:34.166 --> 14:35.125
Experiment.

14:35.209 --> 14:38.754
You're not an officially authorized
regiment yet, it seems.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.423
Not until Lincoln signs
the Emancipation Proclamation.

14:41.507 --> 14:43.258
Okay. And when is that gonna happen?

14:43.342 --> 14:44.801
January 1st, 1863.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.720
Higginson believes it will be soon,

14:47.304 --> 14:49.264
but he can't arm you himself.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.892
He needs permission from General Saxton,

14:51.975 --> 14:54.686
who has to wait for the go-ahead
from Lincoln himself.

14:54.770 --> 14:58.190
It's an infinity of white men lined up,
getting in our way.

14:58.273 --> 15:02.319
I wish I could help you, but I'm just here
to teach you how to read.

15:02.402 --> 15:05.739
-We don't wanna read. We wanna fight.
-We want to get to the future.

15:06.615 --> 15:07.950
Well, I can tell you this.

15:09.618 --> 15:12.746
In order to get to the future,
you need to understand the past.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.333
And that means reading history,

15:17.334 --> 15:21.004
studying all the darkness,

15:21.088 --> 15:22.756
the pain,

15:22.840 --> 15:24.132
the paradox.

15:25.467 --> 15:29.137
America itself is a paradox,
and we have to study that.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.475
'Cause if you can't really confront
that darkness,

15:34.351 --> 15:37.354
how can you move forward into the light?

15:42.818 --> 15:44.862
This buckra might have a point, y'all.

15:45.529 --> 15:46.530
Yeah.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.659
Let's learn to read.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.292
Austin, here you are.

15:58.375 --> 16:00.961
Go get dressed. We're expected
at your father's house tonight.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.589
Excuse me? I'm not speaking to my father.

16:03.672 --> 16:07.467
Yes, yes, I know, but it's his birthday,
and they're having a sing-along and--

16:07.551 --> 16:09.928
You don't listen
to a single word I say, do you?

16:10.512 --> 16:12.598
I have cut myself off from my father.

16:12.681 --> 16:16.685
I will not be attending his birthday.
But I surely won't stop you from going.

16:16.768 --> 16:19.396
As a matter of fact,
I'd love for you to go.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.565
Leave me here alone with the baby.

16:21.648 --> 16:24.985
I haven't gotten to spend time with him.
I'd love to have a night, just him and me.

16:25.611 --> 16:29.323
Why would a father ever want
a night alone with his child?

16:29.406 --> 16:32.409
If you're not coming,
the baby will stay with Clara and Anna.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.744
They can look after him.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.370
You're not listening to me again.

16:36.747 --> 16:39.541
I said, I want to look after him.

16:40.626 --> 16:43.587
You're not even capable
of looking after yourself.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.215
What have you been doing all afternoon?

16:46.298 --> 16:48.425
Drinking again, I assume.

16:49.218 --> 16:52.221
No. I cannot leave you alone
with the baby.

16:52.304 --> 16:55.766
You would likely drop him out of a window
or some equally horrible accident.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.187
Fathers are just not good nurturers,
Austin.

17:00.270 --> 17:01.772
That's just the way it is.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.273
Men have other roles to play.

17:03.941 --> 17:05.817
Really? Like what?

17:06.318 --> 17:08.069
Like fighting in the war.

17:08.779 --> 17:12.449
Why don't you go put a uniform on
and do what you're supposed to do?

17:12.950 --> 17:14.034
It's what men do.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.539
Then maybe your father
might actually be proud of you.

17:23.502 --> 17:24.545
Do you have my song?

17:25.295 --> 17:27.923
Good song.
Do you have "Plenty of Fish in the Sea"?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.466
-Yes.
-Are they all in the right order?

17:29.550 --> 17:31.134
-Yes, yes and--
-Great.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.644
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

17:41.520 --> 17:42.688
Edward!

17:42.771 --> 17:44.773
Edward, can you hear me?

17:44.857 --> 17:46.859
I can hear you just fine, woman.

17:47.693 --> 17:49.361
That's what almost did me in right now.

17:49.444 --> 17:51.321
Thank God.
I thought we lost you for good that time.

17:53.490 --> 17:54.741
What is all the hubbub?

17:55.325 --> 17:58.704
-Well, it was my idea.
-Yeah?

17:58.787 --> 18:01.957
I just wanted to have
an old-fashioned family sing-along

18:02.040 --> 18:03.166
for your birthday.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.793
Well…

18:05.711 --> 18:07.880
I think I would love a bit of music.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.756
Yes. I think I'd like that
very much indeed.

18:10.883 --> 18:14.553
For he's a jolly good fellow
For he's a jolly good fellow

18:14.636 --> 18:19.641
For he's a jolly good fellow
Which nobody can deny

18:23.937 --> 18:26.523
We live in hard and stirring times

18:26.607 --> 18:29.151
Too sad for mirth
Too rough for rhymes

18:29.234 --> 18:31.862
For songs of peace
Have lost their chimes

18:31.945 --> 18:34.531
And that's what's the matter

18:34.615 --> 18:37.034
The men we held as brothers true

18:37.117 --> 18:39.786
Have turned into a rebel crew

18:39.870 --> 18:42.497
And now we have to put them through

18:42.581 --> 18:45.417
For that's what's the matter

18:45.501 --> 18:47.794
That's what's the matter

18:47.878 --> 18:50.547
The rebels have to scatter

18:50.631 --> 18:53.634
We will make them flee
By land and sea

18:53.717 --> 18:56.678
And that's what's the matter

18:56.762 --> 18:59.681
Oh, the sun shines bright

18:59.765 --> 19:02.976
On my old Kentucky home

19:03.060 --> 19:08.482
'Tis summer, the people are gay

19:09.149 --> 19:11.902
The corn tops rise

19:11.985 --> 19:14.905
And the meadow is in bloom

19:14.988 --> 19:20.494
While the birds make music all day

19:21.495 --> 19:24.456
A lady tossed her curls

19:24.540 --> 19:27.417
At all who came to woo

19:27.501 --> 19:30.504
She laughed to scorn the vows

19:30.587 --> 19:33.632
At hearts though false or true

19:33.715 --> 19:36.718
While merrily she sang

19:36.802 --> 19:39.930
And cared all day for naught

19:40.013 --> 19:42.933
There are plenty of fish in the sea

19:43.016 --> 19:46.103
As good as ever were caught

19:46.186 --> 19:49.314
There are plenty of fish in the sea

19:49.398 --> 19:52.609
As good as ever were caught

19:57.531 --> 19:59.658
Listen to the mockingbird

19:59.741 --> 20:01.952
Listen to the mockingbird

20:02.035 --> 20:06.164
The mockingbird still singing
O'er her grave

20:06.248 --> 20:08.542
Listen to the mockingbird

20:08.625 --> 20:10.752
Listen to the mockingbird

20:10.836 --> 20:15.090
Still singing
Where the weeping willows wave

20:15.174 --> 20:17.718
-Yay, Vinnie!
-Vinnie! Yay! More. More. More.

20:18.594 --> 20:19.636
Keep playing.

20:20.929 --> 20:22.222
I needed this.

20:22.973 --> 20:23.974
Thank you.

20:24.558 --> 20:26.894
Oh, God.
Now that my brain fog is clearing, I--

20:27.561 --> 20:30.647
I had a thought I wanted to share
with you about your poem.

20:30.731 --> 20:32.566
My poem? Which one?

20:32.649 --> 20:35.485
The last one you sent me,
right before the baby was born.

20:36.695 --> 20:38.780
"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers."

20:38.864 --> 20:40.699
That's one of the ones I sent to--

20:40.782 --> 20:42.534
One of the ones you sent to who?

20:42.618 --> 20:45.537
To you. To-- That's-- Yeah. Go on.

20:46.788 --> 20:51.668
Yeah, well, I mean, it's--
It is an extraordinary poem.

20:51.752 --> 20:55.506
Just the imagery of death and snow.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.633
It's just beautiful, Emily.

20:58.842 --> 20:59.843
But?

21:00.969 --> 21:03.096
-Is there a but?
-No, no.

21:03.180 --> 21:06.642
Not a but. Just a maybe. I--

21:07.851 --> 21:11.021
I thought maybe it could be better
without the second stanza.

21:11.104 --> 21:12.272
Without it?

21:12.356 --> 21:14.441
Well, it's just my opinion.

21:15.192 --> 21:19.363
But I know that my opinion means more
to you than anyone else's.

21:19.947 --> 21:22.074
It's time to reminisce.

21:22.157 --> 21:24.409
Edward, let's share
some of our fondest memories.

21:24.493 --> 21:25.827
Do we have those?

21:25.911 --> 21:27.037
Of course we do.

21:27.120 --> 21:29.414
Why don't you tell us the story
of how you first met?

21:29.498 --> 21:30.499
All right.

21:31.291 --> 21:33.627
-It was in the 15th century…
-Edward!

21:33.710 --> 21:35.128
-…and I--
-Tell the story.

21:35.212 --> 21:37.840
All right. All right. All right.

21:37.923 --> 21:39.049
All right. Well…

21:40.050 --> 21:44.012
Well, I was a strapping young man,
member of the Massachusetts State Militia.

21:44.513 --> 21:46.431
And I was posted in Monson.

21:46.515 --> 21:47.975
Where I grew up.

21:48.058 --> 21:50.811
And one night, I happened to attend
a chemistry lecture at Monson Academy,

21:50.894 --> 21:51.895
and wouldn't you know it,

21:51.979 --> 21:55.148
young Miss Emily Norcross sat
just beside me.

21:55.232 --> 21:56.942
What?
Mom, you went to a chemistry lecture?

21:57.025 --> 22:00.237
I assure you, I was only there
to hold the seat for my brother.

22:00.320 --> 22:03.490
I intended to hurry on home
the minute any science got started.

22:03.574 --> 22:06.910
Yes, but she stayed for the chemistry,
if you permit me.

22:08.370 --> 22:12.624
He was a major,
with a sash and a sword and everything.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.668
It was love at first sight.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.921
Is that why you left my proposal letter
unanswered for three months?

22:18.505 --> 22:19.840
It wasn't that long.

22:19.923 --> 22:22.176
Three months.
She left me high and dry three months.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.428
-Unbelievable.
-What was the wedding like?

22:24.511 --> 22:26.680
The wedding. Let's see.

22:27.431 --> 22:30.517
Well, I remember I was so excited
the night before that I couldn't sleep.

22:30.601 --> 22:33.770
So I just stared at the candle
as it burned ever lower,

22:33.854 --> 22:37.024
until its light was extinguished forever.

22:40.611 --> 22:45.199
My sister, Lavinia, God bless her soul,
she didn't want me to get married.

22:45.282 --> 22:47.117
She thought I was too young.

22:47.201 --> 22:49.536
She didn't know how she'd survive
on the farm without me.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.121
She was in a true panic about it.

22:51.205 --> 22:54.082
I remember she spent
our entire wedding day in tears.

22:54.958 --> 22:55.959
That's…

22:58.921 --> 23:01.507
Well, look, it all worked out.

23:01.590 --> 23:04.718
A great life with Edward,
three beautiful children.

23:05.302 --> 23:07.304
And who cares if I never got to see
my mother again

23:07.387 --> 23:09.389
because, by the time I was able
to get back to Monson

23:09.473 --> 23:10.766
after the three of you were born,

23:10.849 --> 23:12.768
she already wasted away from yellow fever.

23:17.773 --> 23:18.774
Sweet memories.

23:18.857 --> 23:22.027
Yes. Great.

23:22.110 --> 23:24.780
You know, I saw my wedding dress
just this morning.

23:24.863 --> 23:28.116
It was packed away
along with Grandmother Norcross's quilt,

23:28.200 --> 23:29.201
gathering dust.

23:29.284 --> 23:30.536
I remember that dress.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.081
You do, do you?

23:34.164 --> 23:36.542
-Yes. You should go put it on.
-Edward.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.419
Edward, stop.

23:39.503 --> 23:41.630
-It would never fit.
-Mom, go try.

23:41.713 --> 23:44.007
Please, I am not the child bride

23:44.091 --> 23:47.052
your father ripped from the bosom
of her family anymore.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.596
You'll always be that child bride to me.

23:49.680 --> 23:50.931
Okay, that--

23:53.016 --> 23:54.351
I miss my sister.

23:58.856 --> 24:00.899
Life is hard for us all, isn't it?

24:03.360 --> 24:05.529
Hey, I think I know a song about that.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.823
Go on then.

24:31.680 --> 24:35.475
Let us pause in life's journeys

24:35.559 --> 24:38.228
And count its many tears

24:38.312 --> 24:43.692
While we all sup sorrow with the poor

24:45.319 --> 24:49.281
There's a song that will linger

24:49.364 --> 24:51.909
Forever in our ears

24:51.992 --> 24:57.164
Oh, hard times come again no more

24:58.916 --> 25:01.084
'Tis the song

25:01.168 --> 25:05.631
The sigh of the weary

25:06.340 --> 25:09.801
Hard times, hard times

25:09.885 --> 25:12.513
Come again no more

25:12.596 --> 25:16.350
Many days you have lingered

25:16.433 --> 25:19.102
Around my cabin door

25:19.186 --> 25:22.147
Oh, hard times

25:22.231 --> 25:24.441
Come again no more

25:26.235 --> 25:30.197
While we seek mirth and beauty

25:30.280 --> 25:32.866
And music light and gay

25:32.950 --> 25:35.744
There are frail forms

25:35.827 --> 25:37.829
Fainting at the door

25:39.373 --> 25:43.544
Though their voices are silent

25:43.627 --> 25:46.046
Their pleading looks will say

25:46.129 --> 25:49.049
Oh, hard times

25:49.132 --> 25:52.052
Come again no more

25:52.970 --> 25:56.098
Oh, hard times

25:56.765 --> 25:58.892
Come again no more

26:00.143 --> 26:01.520
You came.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.982
Happy birthday, old man.

26:05.858 --> 26:08.610
Thanks.
I'm glad you could make it for that one.

26:09.194 --> 26:10.821
It's just such a beautiful song.

26:11.321 --> 26:12.906
Yeah. I love that one.

26:12.990 --> 26:16.034
Perhaps you two should teach it
to your young boy one day.

26:16.118 --> 26:17.452
You mean, me and Emily?

26:18.203 --> 26:19.830
No. I meant you and Austin.

26:22.040 --> 26:24.334
We were just having
some fond memories tonight.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.796
Speaking of memories, I'll be right back.

26:27.880 --> 26:29.548
-Where are you going?
-Upstairs.

26:30.257 --> 26:31.341
What?

26:31.425 --> 26:33.260
I'll just be a moment.

26:36.180 --> 26:38.765
Austin, don't you think you've had enough?

26:39.600 --> 26:41.810
Listen to your wife. She's right.

26:43.478 --> 26:48.192
Actually, I'd like to say a few words,
if that's all right.

26:48.275 --> 26:50.527
A birthday toast. Yes, go right ahead.

26:51.153 --> 26:52.863
Not exactly a toast.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.075
Oh, for God's sake.

26:57.159 --> 26:59.036
All right. Here it is.

27:00.037 --> 27:01.371
I've been doing some thinking.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.332
That's a bit unusual for you.

27:04.458 --> 27:08.795
Now, it won't come as any surprise
to any of you that I've been unhappy.

27:09.505 --> 27:13.800
Of course, our whole country is unhappy.
Unhappy and in pain.

27:14.301 --> 27:19.431
And sometimes it's hard to tell your pain
apart from the general sorrow of society,

27:19.515 --> 27:20.516
you know?

27:20.599 --> 27:24.269
But the fact is, I don't like
the way my life has turned out.

27:24.937 --> 27:26.939
For more reasons than I can count.

27:27.648 --> 27:31.193
"Turned out"?
But you're still young, my boy.

27:31.276 --> 27:32.819
Yes, that's right.

27:33.570 --> 27:35.322
My life isn't over yet,

27:35.405 --> 27:38.075
and that means I still have
the power to make some changes.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.451
What do you mean, "changes"?

27:39.535 --> 27:41.912
-I'm not sure now is the best time to--
-Let me talk, Emily.

27:43.580 --> 27:45.207
I've made
some important decisions tonight,

27:45.290 --> 27:46.708
and I'm here to share them with you.

27:48.585 --> 27:53.674
First off, I'm leaving the law office
of Edward Dickinson and Son.

27:54.299 --> 27:56.343
I'll be starting my own firm.

27:56.426 --> 27:57.594
Your own firm?

27:58.387 --> 27:59.721
You're not ready for that.

28:00.305 --> 28:02.683
And where will you be finding
your clients?

28:02.766 --> 28:04.393
Or do you plan on
helping yourself to mine?

28:04.476 --> 28:06.728
I've already got a few clients,
as a matter of fact,

28:06.812 --> 28:09.314
because I'll be specializing
in a whole new area of law.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.067
Excuse me? What area?

28:13.026 --> 28:14.027
Divorce.

28:15.487 --> 28:17.573
I've been reading up on the subject.

28:17.656 --> 28:21.785
It seems there's a growing demand
for divorce lawyers these days.

28:21.869 --> 28:25.330
More and more marriages,
when you look under the surface,

28:25.414 --> 28:28.166
turn out to conceal
irreconcilable differences,

28:28.250 --> 28:30.627
just like the Yankees
and the Confederates.

28:30.711 --> 28:34.298
There just comes a point
when you can't live together anymore.

28:34.923 --> 28:36.925
And I'll have an edge in the area,

28:37.426 --> 28:39.803
since I've experienced
just such a marriage myself.

28:41.972 --> 28:43.432
I'm divorcing you, Susan.

28:44.516 --> 28:46.685
And I'll be taking
full custody of the child.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.440
I put on my wedding dress.
Look, it still fits.

28:52.941 --> 28:54.860
-Wait. What's happening?
-Just…

28:58.113 --> 29:00.324
I mean it. We're done.

29:00.407 --> 29:05.621
This, whatever this is or was, is over.

29:13.420 --> 29:15.964
You won't even remember this
in the morning.

29:17.216 --> 29:19.301
I'll just go back upstairs.

29:27.309 --> 29:29.186
Austin, how could you?

29:29.269 --> 29:30.812
I think you know how I could, Emily.

29:30.896 --> 29:32.898
I think you know
better than anyone, I'd say.

29:32.981 --> 29:35.317
Your drinking is out of control.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.361
Austin,
I won't let you do this to yourself.

29:37.903 --> 29:40.072
I won't let you ruin your own life!

29:40.155 --> 29:42.658
Don't worry about that.
You've already ruined it for me.

29:42.741 --> 29:45.327
You will stop this.
You will stop this right now!

29:45.410 --> 29:48.080
Why don't you just go ahead
and hit me? Come on.

29:48.664 --> 29:50.123
Hit me like you used to hit her.

29:51.708 --> 29:52.584
Austin.

29:53.210 --> 29:54.211
What?

29:54.711 --> 29:57.339
We all knew. We just pretended not to.

29:57.923 --> 30:01.635
But I'm not going to protect
this loser's feelings anymore.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.595
-Em.
-I can't make a new future for myself

30:03.679 --> 30:06.098
if I continue to lie about the past.

30:13.772 --> 30:15.482
I can't change the past.

30:16.066 --> 30:18.068
But I will never give up on this family,

30:18.819 --> 30:20.445
and I will never give up on you.

30:23.824 --> 30:25.659
Austin, just get out. You need to leave.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.744
You couldn't keep me here if you tried.

30:30.706 --> 30:32.791
Hey, listen to me.

30:33.292 --> 30:34.293
What?

30:37.671 --> 30:40.257
You told me I had to choose.

30:41.049 --> 30:43.802
You said it was either you or him.

30:45.596 --> 30:46.889
Well, guess what?

30:48.473 --> 30:49.641
I choose him.

30:50.767 --> 30:52.769
I choose our father.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.819
Well, it's your funeral.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.696
Vinnie. My sweet sister.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.907
-Mom?
-Vinnie, forgive me--

31:10.495 --> 31:11.538
Dear God!

31:15.292 --> 31:18.795
Edward, I'm sorry. I do. I do.

31:19.838 --> 31:21.048
Jesus Christ.

31:22.466 --> 31:23.717
I have no regrets.

31:23.800 --> 31:26.345
I just wanted to make everyone happy.

31:26.428 --> 31:28.013
Emily, my love.

31:30.766 --> 31:33.602
Okay, I am breaking
my vow of silence to say

31:34.228 --> 31:36.230
this family is absolutely insane.

31:46.073 --> 31:47.157
Sue, I--

31:47.241 --> 31:48.992
Emily, don't touch me right now.

31:51.411 --> 31:53.288
I know how upset you must be.

31:53.830 --> 31:55.207
He didn't mean it.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.793
-He won't leave you, Sue.
-Emily, I don't care about Austin.

31:57.876 --> 31:59.294
I care about you.

32:00.212 --> 32:02.297
You need to explain this to me.

32:09.471 --> 32:12.015
-His name is Higginson, and--
-I know who he is.

32:12.641 --> 32:13.934
I've read his work.

32:14.434 --> 32:17.020
-I have a brain too. Remember?
-Yes. Of course.

32:17.104 --> 32:19.439
What I don't understand is
why you gave this man

32:19.523 --> 32:21.984
the same poem that you gave to me.

32:24.236 --> 32:28.532
He invited young writers
to reach out to him, so I reached out.

32:29.032 --> 32:31.994
And sent him
"Safe in their Alabaster Chambers."

32:33.871 --> 32:35.122
Yes.

32:39.793 --> 32:44.381
"Would-- Would you have time
to be the friend you should think I need?

32:44.464 --> 32:46.341
I have a little shape.

32:46.425 --> 32:51.388
It would not crowd your desk nor make
much racket as the mouse."

32:51.471 --> 32:56.852
"Will you be my preceptor, Mr. Higginson?
I am in danger, sir…"

32:56.935 --> 32:58.228
Oh, my God, Emily.

32:58.312 --> 33:01.106
This letter makes it sound like
you're helpless.

33:01.732 --> 33:05.068
Like you're completely alone.
It doesn't even mention me.

33:05.152 --> 33:08.405
-Look, I wanted to. I just--
-It's like ever since I've had a baby,

33:08.488 --> 33:10.407
I have ceased to exist!

33:10.490 --> 33:11.533
Sue, please!

33:12.784 --> 33:13.785
You know what?

33:16.955 --> 33:18.373
You're just like Austin.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.920
Well, what does that mean?

33:23.670 --> 33:25.881
You think you're fighting for something,
but really,

33:27.132 --> 33:28.592
you're just running away.
