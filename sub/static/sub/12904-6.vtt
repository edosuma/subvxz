After my friend passed away
and her husband moved,

00:02.982 --> 00:05.773
I wrote a book that ended up
bringing me back to life.

00:05.793 --> 00:07.544
<i>Previously on "Mistresses"...</i>

00:07.564 --> 00:09.972
A year ago, it was... it was
the scariest night of my life.

00:09.992 --> 00:11.587
I honestly thought I was gonna die.

00:11.607 --> 00:14.309
You've got to lighten up, man.
We are opening a restaurant.

00:14.343 --> 00:15.510
It's supposed to be fun.

00:15.544 --> 00:18.759
I met the most gorgeous man I've ever
seen in my entire life at a taco truck.

00:18.779 --> 00:20.415
[Cellphone rings]

00:20.449 --> 00:21.616
Hi.

00:21.651 --> 00:23.285
When you land, call me.

00:23.319 --> 00:25.507
- She gets it, April.
- Thank you.

00:25.527 --> 00:27.998
Marc: She's in ninth grade. She's
got three more years of high school.

00:28.018 --> 00:30.155
But it's there, right in front of me...

00:30.175 --> 00:32.487
A big fat nest of emptiness.

00:33.712 --> 00:37.415
[Sighs] What the hell
are you doing here?

00:37.449 --> 00:39.517
[Sighs] Oh, my God.

00:39.551 --> 00:41.085
[Chuckles]

00:41.119 --> 00:43.506
- Hello, Karen.
- [Sighs]

00:44.852 --> 00:46.717
She's so beautiful.

00:46.737 --> 00:48.617
She's 4 months today.

00:49.695 --> 00:51.229
[Sighs]

00:51.263 --> 00:53.551
- I've missed so much.
- You've missed everything.

00:53.571 --> 00:55.600
It was just too hard
for me without Vivian.

00:55.634 --> 00:58.042
If I recall, you said you couldn't stay

00:58.062 --> 01:00.417
because of what <i>people might think,</i>

01:00.437 --> 01:03.007
that you'd been cheating
on your dying wife with me,

01:03.041 --> 01:04.903
and that's how we ended
up with our daughter.

01:04.923 --> 01:08.430
In hindsight, it was a mistake,
and I'm so sorry.

01:10.361 --> 01:12.950
What are you doing here?
What happened to Costa Rica?

01:12.985 --> 01:16.247
Uh, Doctors Without Borders gave
me a week off for an interview.

01:16.267 --> 01:20.391
I'm on the short list for the chief
of cardiothoracic surgery at UCLA.

01:20.411 --> 01:22.607
- Why didn't you tell me?
- [Scoffs]

01:22.627 --> 01:25.500
Let's face it... we haven't
exactly been great on the phone.

01:25.520 --> 01:28.766
And when I read about how much
pain I had caused you...

01:28.800 --> 01:31.980
- You... read my book?
- Hey, I get it.

01:32.000 --> 01:35.306
- We all deal in our own way.
- [Vivian fusses]

01:35.340 --> 01:39.310
We have so much to talk about,
and I am running on fumes.

01:39.344 --> 01:41.812
Please, can I take you to dinner
tomorrow night?

01:41.847 --> 01:44.875
Sure. On the early side... For the baby.

01:44.895 --> 01:46.617
Of course.

01:48.235 --> 01:50.285
It's so good to see you, Karen.

01:57.191 --> 01:59.130
I've missed you.

02:06.605 --> 02:08.187
Good night, Karen.

02:25.692 --> 02:28.279
Transgender? Really?

02:28.299 --> 02:29.897
I know. I was pretty surprised, as well.

02:29.917 --> 02:32.102
So that's the whole story?
He's transgender?

02:32.122 --> 02:33.464
Did... Did something else happen?

02:33.498 --> 02:36.500
No, no. The story is,
I was surprised, obviously.

02:36.535 --> 02:38.536
And when I saw him the next night,

02:38.570 --> 02:41.086
he thought I said something
insensitive and fired me.

02:41.106 --> 02:44.084
Oh, no. [Sighs] What did you say?

02:44.104 --> 02:46.543
Nothing. I just said that
even if I wasn't with Marc,

02:46.563 --> 02:48.596
I could never be attracted
to him because he was,

02:48.616 --> 02:51.382
you know, born a woman. Was that so bad?

02:52.285 --> 02:54.678
- Well, it wasn't great.
- Why? That's how I feel.

02:54.698 --> 02:56.053
And your feelings are valid,

02:56.088 --> 02:58.332
but maybe you should have
kept some of them to yourself.

02:58.352 --> 02:59.625
Okay, let me remind everyone

02:59.645 --> 03:01.877
that he knew I was in a relationship.

03:01.897 --> 03:03.912
He was my boss, and he kissed me.

03:03.932 --> 03:06.664
- She makes a good point.
- Whatever. It's over.

03:06.698 --> 03:08.257
We parted ways. Moving on.

03:08.277 --> 03:11.268
Speaking of which,
I should get back to work.

03:13.701 --> 03:17.326
So [Sighs] Alec is back.

03:17.346 --> 03:19.004
What?! Why didn't you tell us?

03:19.024 --> 03:22.065
April was talking about her issues
with people who are transgender.

03:22.085 --> 03:23.555
I do not...

03:23.660 --> 03:25.200
Never mind.

03:25.446 --> 03:27.883
So, how was it? How did you feel?

03:27.903 --> 03:30.237
It felt strange.

03:30.272 --> 03:34.842
And I can't be too sure, but what if
he wants to pick up where we left off?

03:34.876 --> 03:38.115
- Did he say that?
- Not in words. It was more in his hug.

03:38.135 --> 03:40.448
Oh, yeah. Well, Alec's not
a hugger. He's too tall.

03:40.482 --> 03:41.732
Exactly my point.

03:41.752 --> 03:44.185
But let's say he does
want to get back together.

03:44.219 --> 03:45.872
- Would you be into it?
- I don't know.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.922
I haven't let myself think about it

03:47.942 --> 03:51.807
because I've been so mad. And I
didn't think it was really an option.

03:51.827 --> 03:53.360
It shouldn't be. Alec had his chance.

03:53.395 --> 03:55.207
But Alec is Vivian's dad,

03:55.227 --> 03:58.750
and if he's truly sorry
and you can forgive him,

03:58.770 --> 04:01.846
keeping the family together
could be a good thing.

04:01.866 --> 04:03.637
RANDY: You went out with a married guy?

04:03.672 --> 04:04.839
He's actually separated.

04:04.873 --> 04:07.374
You do realize that separated
means they're still married?

04:07.409 --> 04:09.964
[Sighs] I answered the call
in a moment of weakness.

04:09.984 --> 04:13.614
Now that I've gone out with him,
there's this... undeniable connection.

04:13.648 --> 04:16.712
We both love
the same cheesy romantic movies,

04:16.732 --> 04:19.553
and the sex... was mind-blowing.

04:19.588 --> 04:22.223
Ah. That's why you're smitten.
It's the oxytocin.

04:22.257 --> 04:24.325
[Chuckles] The oxy-what?

04:24.680 --> 04:27.661
- Is it a gay thing?
- No! It's a woman thing.

04:27.696 --> 04:30.558
The hormone that makes women
fall in love after sex.

04:30.578 --> 04:33.300
That's what you're feeling,
not true love.

04:33.335 --> 04:36.423
Mm. I guess that does make sense.

04:36.793 --> 04:39.140
It's not like
we know each other so well.

04:39.174 --> 04:42.076
[Scoffs] Really, what am I doing?
I shouldn't be pursuing this, anyway.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.812
I don't want to be the girl who waits
around for the guy to leave his wife.

04:44.846 --> 04:46.580
[Sighs] Amen to that, sister.

04:46.615 --> 04:48.649
You're right. No more texts or calls.

04:48.683 --> 04:51.143
Great. Time to start
thinking with your head

04:51.163 --> 04:52.744
and not your hoo-ha.

04:56.064 --> 04:57.758
Fantastic. Mm-hmm.

04:57.792 --> 05:00.153
Yes, thank you.

05:00.567 --> 05:01.922
Guess where we're going tomorrow.

05:01.942 --> 05:03.702
- Las Vegas.
- Uh, no.

05:03.722 --> 05:06.209
I got us an appointment to see
a potential wedding venue...

05:06.229 --> 05:09.203
- The Calamigos Ranch.
- Oh, that sounds spectacular.

Yes. Okay, yeah. I'm in.

a few, um, errands.

Please don't make me.

05:50.412 --> 05:52.919
You've always had a good time
at the church fundraisers.

05:52.939 --> 05:56.483
That's before I thought about
what the church really represents.

05:56.518 --> 05:59.603
Most of the world's atrocities are
committed under the name of religion.

05:59.623 --> 06:01.422
I just can't support that with brownies.

06:01.456 --> 06:03.390
- Is that so?
- Yes.

06:03.425 --> 06:06.393
Plus, I'm supposed to be studying at
Noel's that day for our next debate.

06:06.413 --> 06:07.761
So you're going to Noel's?

06:07.781 --> 06:10.130
- When were you gonna let me know?
- I just did.

06:10.165 --> 06:12.018
His parents are gonna be there.
You can call them.

06:12.038 --> 06:14.868
Oh, I will. But you're still
going to the fundraiser.

06:16.805 --> 06:18.672

because you want me to.

06:20.775 --> 06:24.090
- Do you really want that?
- Yes. Your religion is important.

- Whatever.

won't be so mean to me.

You know him... always
thinking about the future.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.169
Speaking of which, he made plans
for all of us this evening...

19:12.203 --> 19:14.138
Front-row tickets to the new Cirque.

19:14.172 --> 19:15.673
Ah, wow, that sounds like...

19:15.707 --> 19:17.641
We'd love to.

19:17.676 --> 19:19.677
Great. I'll call the driver.

19:19.711 --> 19:20.978
[Laughs]

19:21.012 --> 19:22.646
But what about our upcoming nuptials?

19:22.681 --> 19:24.972
Listen to me.
This is your business, okay?

19:24.992 --> 19:26.848
It would be bad form
to turn down the invitation.

19:26.868 --> 19:27.886
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:27.906 --> 19:29.004
You're sure you're okay with this?

19:29.024 --> 19:30.921
Only if you promise
we get married tomorrow night.

19:30.955 --> 19:34.525
- I'll send you a "Save the Date."
- Mm.

19:34.559 --> 19:36.260
I'm so proud of you.

19:36.294 --> 19:38.162
Why do I keep offending people?

19:38.196 --> 19:41.131
First, Michael, now Lucy and Marc.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.000
Because you have strong opinions.

19:43.034 --> 19:44.859
See, that sounds very close

19:44.879 --> 19:47.072
to when Marc called me "authoritarian."

19:47.092 --> 19:48.123
Let me ask you,

19:48.158 --> 19:51.560
why is it so important
that Lucy goes to church?

19:51.594 --> 19:54.168
At the most basic level,
spiritual guidance.

19:54.188 --> 19:56.331
But what if she's not open
to that right now?

19:56.366 --> 19:59.586
She's 14 years old. She doesn't
always know what's good for her.

19:59.606 --> 20:00.940
Plus, it's one of the few things

20:00.974 --> 20:03.175
Lucy and I... still get to do together.

20:03.210 --> 20:04.310
Oh, I get it.

20:04.344 --> 20:07.513
So this is all really about
your fear of losing her.

20:07.547 --> 20:09.114
I mean...

20:09.149 --> 20:11.650
Hey, wait. Don't psychoanalyze me.

20:14.654 --> 20:16.522
How was your dinner with Alec?

20:16.556 --> 20:19.765
Is he... interested in starting
things back up again?

20:19.785 --> 20:23.195
Considering he introduced me
to his wife, I'm gonna say no.

20:23.230 --> 20:25.197
- Alec is married?
- Yep.

20:25.232 --> 20:26.198
And he brought her to dinner?

20:26.233 --> 20:30.002
She showed up halfway through,
as a surprise. And get this...

20:30.036 --> 20:32.838
He told her that I asked him
to leave me and the baby.

20:32.873 --> 20:35.450
- What?! That's crazy!
- What was he thinking,

20:35.470 --> 20:39.378
marrying a woman he barely knows
after a 20-year marriage?

20:39.412 --> 20:41.213
I'm offended on behalf of Vivian.

20:41.248 --> 20:42.281
As you should be.

20:42.315 --> 20:44.950
He was so distraught,
he had to go to Costa Rica,

20:44.985 --> 20:47.019
but not distraught enough to stop him

20:47.053 --> 20:49.722
from marrying
some 30-year-old pediatrician.

20:49.756 --> 20:52.992
Well, if she's a pediatrician,
that could be helpful.

20:53.026 --> 20:54.334
Not the point.

20:54.354 --> 20:56.295
The point is, Alec decided to move back,

20:56.329 --> 21:01.438
and he and... Faith want to take
the baby for the weekend.

21:02.235 --> 21:03.269
What am I gonna do?

21:03.303 --> 21:06.872
Okay, first of all, you have
every right to be angry.

21:06.907 --> 21:09.575
But Alec is Vivian's father,
and if he's moving back,

21:09.609 --> 21:11.844
he's gonna be a part of both your lives.

21:11.878 --> 21:15.080
Okay, just don't ask for trouble.

21:15.115 --> 21:18.717
Be cool and just work this out
as calmly as possible.

21:20.777 --> 21:22.021
Mm.

21:22.055 --> 21:24.252
You are such a good cuddler.

21:24.272 --> 21:27.226
Well, what can I say? You inspire me.

21:27.260 --> 21:29.662
In fact, you know what? Hell with it.
I'm gonna take the rest of the day off

21:29.696 --> 21:31.430
so we can continue to do this.

21:31.464 --> 21:33.399
Mm!

21:35.990 --> 21:37.937
What is this? Are you going on
vacation or something?

21:37.971 --> 21:39.838
[Groans] No, no.

21:39.873 --> 21:42.241
- I'm actually the house sitter.
- Oh.

21:42.275 --> 21:44.276
I wish I could afford a place like this.

21:44.311 --> 21:46.145
[Cellphone ringing]

21:47.213 --> 21:50.182
Oh. Hell no. Nope.

21:50.216 --> 21:51.684
Mm.

21:51.718 --> 21:54.046
Was that your wife?

21:54.178 --> 21:55.621
No. No. It was work.

21:55.655 --> 21:57.589
But I'm taking the day off, remember?

21:59.529 --> 22:01.093
Okay.

22:03.043 --> 22:05.531
M-My marriage was a mistake, all right?

22:05.565 --> 22:09.414
I rushed into it after
another relationship went...

22:09.722 --> 22:11.138
bad.

22:12.339 --> 22:14.907
But now I feel like I can
finally breathe again, you know.

22:14.941 --> 22:16.408
Especially here with you.

22:19.156 --> 22:22.050
We had an amazing morning, right?

22:22.314 --> 22:23.716
Can we not talk about it?

22:23.750 --> 22:26.285
- Let's not talk at all.
- Mm.

22:27.854 --> 22:29.221
Mm.

22:29.255 --> 22:31.790
Big day, mate. We are getting married.

22:31.825 --> 22:34.931
Ah. Congratulations.
I've never heard that before.

22:36.696 --> 22:38.090
- Tip included?
- Uh, no.

22:38.110 --> 22:39.807
Great. Thanks.

22:39.966 --> 22:42.668
Okay. Wakey, wakey, baby.

22:42.702 --> 22:44.965
- Oh!
- Breakfast is served.

22:44.985 --> 22:47.270
We have the caviar, eggs Benedict,

22:47.290 --> 22:49.455
and toast with some champagne jelly.

22:49.490 --> 22:50.957
Voilà.

22:52.493 --> 22:54.327
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

22:54.361 --> 22:56.162
- Is that real gold leaf?
- Oh, yeah, honey.

22:56.197 --> 22:59.065
The most expensive breakfast
on the menu for nothing.

22:59.099 --> 23:02.502
Okay. Um, honey,
while I appreciate the thought,

23:02.536 --> 23:04.270
this is... this is officially too much.

23:04.305 --> 23:06.239
Oh, yeah, I grant you, it is outrageous,

23:06.273 --> 23:08.308
but I am just letting myself enjoy it,

23:08.342 --> 23:10.410
especially... since it's comped.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.345
Yeah. Um, listen, honey.

23:12.379 --> 23:13.913
- Hmm?
- I'm just, I'm just a little worried

23:13.948 --> 23:15.720
you're gonna lose touch with reality.

23:15.740 --> 23:18.618
I've seen you make money before,
but this time, it's different.

23:18.652 --> 23:20.854
Yeah, it is different,
because I'm enjoying it more.

23:20.888 --> 23:23.590
You know, I'm not...
I'm not stressing out.

23:23.624 --> 23:25.959
You know what, babe?

23:25.993 --> 23:27.527
Kate and I did not
have a lot growing up,

23:27.561 --> 23:30.797
so why not live in the moment?

23:30.831 --> 23:33.166
O...kay. So it's wish fulfillment.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.935
- [Both laugh]
- Hey, everything on this bed is more

23:35.970 --> 23:38.371
than I could have ever wished for.

23:38.405 --> 23:39.721
Honey.

23:39.741 --> 23:41.241
- [Chuckles]
- Okay, okay.

23:41.275 --> 23:43.610
If you put it like that,
by all means, then let's dig in.

23:43.644 --> 23:46.779
All righty. Oh,
you know what? One second.

23:46.814 --> 23:48.448
I want to get a photo
and send it to Kate.

23:48.482 --> 23:49.816
Oh, okay.

23:49.850 --> 23:51.417
- Grab your eggs.
- Grab the eggs.

23:51.452 --> 23:52.785
The eggs are the most important thing.

23:52.820 --> 23:53.953
- Oh, yeah.
- [Camera shutter clicks]

23:53.988 --> 23:55.355
Oh, that's good. Right.

23:55.389 --> 23:57.223
Yep. That's the stuff.

23:57.258 --> 23:59.826
- What?! [Gasps]
- Gorgeous.

23:59.860 --> 24:02.061
- [Cellphone chimes]
- Mm. Do you need to get that?

24:02.096 --> 24:03.663
[Sighs]

24:03.697 --> 24:05.464
[Cellphone chimes]

24:05.843 --> 24:07.000
[Laughs]

24:07.034 --> 24:09.636
No, it's just my future
sister-in-law being silly

24:09.670 --> 24:11.504
with her eggs Benedict.

24:11.538 --> 24:15.341
I don't want to know what that means,
but I am, all of a sudden, starving.

24:15.376 --> 24:17.010
Well, we have been burning
a lot of calories.

24:17.044 --> 24:18.049
Hmm.

24:18.069 --> 24:20.143
- I'll get us something.
- Nope.

24:20.163 --> 24:21.514
You stay right there.

24:21.548 --> 24:23.316
- Aah!
- [Laughs]

24:54.179 --> 24:55.648
[Laughs]

24:56.537 --> 24:59.886
Thing is, I, uh... turns out
I do have to run into work.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.842
So, uh, just grab all of this,
and you take care, and, um...

25:04.974 --> 25:06.400
Where are you going?

25:06.420 --> 25:07.798
Scott?

25:08.329 --> 25:11.230
[Door opens, closes]

25:11.265 --> 25:12.265
[Groans]

25:14.257 --> 25:16.572
She usually naps around
3:00 and is always

25:16.592 --> 25:18.356
in a terrible mood when she wakes up.

25:18.376 --> 25:22.531
Faith wanted me to ask if you
are pro- or anti-pacifier.

25:22.565 --> 25:25.300
She didn't want to give Vivian
one unless you're okay with it.

25:25.334 --> 25:27.135
I'm okay with it.

25:27.170 --> 25:28.436
Where is Faith, by the way?

25:28.471 --> 25:32.240
Oh, I thought it best if I came alone.

25:32.275 --> 25:34.609
I realized we kind of
ambushed you last night.

25:34.644 --> 25:36.104
Oh, that's okay.

25:36.124 --> 25:39.574
I'm not sure there would have
been an easy way to do that.

25:40.100 --> 25:41.983
Thank you for being
so gracious about this.

25:42.018 --> 25:44.486
Of course.

25:44.520 --> 25:47.622
Although, I was wondering
if we can start with you

25:47.657 --> 25:49.457
taking the baby one night

25:49.492 --> 25:52.160
and then build up to a full weekend.

25:52.195 --> 25:54.462
It's just that I've never been
away from her so long, and...

25:54.497 --> 25:57.666
That sounds perfectly reasonable.

25:57.700 --> 26:00.635
Look at us, doing this like adults.

26:00.670 --> 26:03.438
It actually works out well
because I'm interviewing

26:03.472 --> 26:06.172
potential full-time nannies
later on today.

26:07.521 --> 26:08.867
Why?

26:09.351 --> 26:11.913
- Why what?
- Why do you need a new fulltime nanny?

26:11.948 --> 26:13.481
Because the last one left.

26:13.516 --> 26:15.450
And in addition to being a mommy,

26:15.484 --> 26:17.919
I've got my practice,
and I'm writing a second book.

26:17.954 --> 26:19.821
But now that I'm moving back,
is that really necessary?

26:19.855 --> 26:23.491
To be fair, I only found out
you're moving back yesterday.

26:25.421 --> 26:29.564
I'd just... rather not have
our child raised by a stranger.

26:31.226 --> 26:33.635
Why don't I push the
interviews to tomorrow

26:33.669 --> 26:35.303
so that you can meet them, too?

26:35.338 --> 26:37.872
That way, they won't be strangers.

26:37.907 --> 26:39.311
All right.

26:40.217 --> 26:42.277
I'd appreciate that.

[Chuckles]

27:04.890 --> 27:06.968
- [Sighs]
- Your fiancé just got recognized

27:07.003 --> 27:08.453
by a couple of the SVPs at Wynn.

27:08.473 --> 27:10.207
Oh. I hope you chased them away.

- You know I did.
- [Both laugh]

- I'm okay.

27:15.346 --> 27:17.414

- Of course. Cheers, mate.

Uh, okay, okay, okay.

27:24.522 --> 27:26.757
If you could have any fake
celebrity officiate our wedding,

27:26.791 --> 27:27.891
- who would it be?
- Robert De Niro.

27:27.925 --> 27:28.959
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:28.993 --> 27:30.927
Honey, that seems weird.
Anyway, I got us Charo.

27:30.947 --> 27:33.463
- Well, who the hell is Charo?
- You don't know who Charo is?

27:33.498 --> 27:35.632
She's... Charo.

27:35.666 --> 27:38.635
Whatever. Our... Our wedding is
officially in T-minus two hours.

27:38.669 --> 27:40.337
- Brilliant.
- [Laughs]

27:40.371 --> 27:42.272
- You feeling lucky?
- I'm marrying you, aren't I?

27:42.306 --> 27:44.274
- [Both laugh]
- Blow on them for good luck.

27:44.308 --> 27:46.176
- [Blows]
- Okay.

27:46.210 --> 27:48.345
- Come on!
- Yeah, baby!

27:48.379 --> 27:49.479
[All cheer]

27:49.514 --> 27:51.853
How about that? Whoo-hoo-hoo!

27:54.719 --> 27:57.754
Well, this is fun.
Maybe I should get my cellphone.

27:57.789 --> 28:00.157
Sorry. I'm just checking in
on Alec and the baby.

28:00.191 --> 28:02.192
She's been very fussy lately.

28:02.226 --> 28:04.361
Isn't his new wife a pediatrician?

28:04.395 --> 28:06.296
We should change the subject.

28:06.330 --> 28:07.697
Kate, what's going on with you?

28:07.732 --> 28:10.300
You know... Same old, same old.

28:10.334 --> 28:12.436
Nothing new at all?

28:12.470 --> 28:14.094
Well...

28:14.872 --> 28:17.541
nothing compared to what
poor Randy's going through.

28:17.575 --> 28:19.309
What's going on with Randy?

28:19.343 --> 28:23.547
You can never tell him
I told you this, but...

28:23.913 --> 28:26.216
Randy's seeing a married man.

28:26.250 --> 28:27.976
Randy's gay?

28:29.053 --> 28:30.954
What? I don't stereotype.

28:32.390 --> 28:36.026
Anyway, earlier today, they were
having a great morning,

28:36.060 --> 28:38.361
and the married guy was gonna
take the day off.

28:38.396 --> 28:39.863
But then, out of nowhere,

28:39.897 --> 28:41.465
he actually does need to go to work,

28:41.499 --> 28:44.334
and "Take care"...
practically runs out the door.

28:46.351 --> 28:47.637
Can you explain that?

39:54.476 --> 39:56.711
- [Knock on door]
- Oh.

40:02.151 --> 40:03.652
Are you Karen Kim?

40:03.686 --> 40:04.886
Yes.

40:06.322 --> 40:09.391
You've just been served.

40:09.425 --> 40:11.059
[Gasps]

40:18.727 --> 40:21.336
- Karen.
- I need to speak to Alec.

40:21.370 --> 40:23.071
He'll be right here.

40:23.105 --> 40:26.441
- I'd invite you in, but I...
- I don't want to come in.

40:26.475 --> 40:28.481
[Sighs] It's okay.

40:29.554 --> 40:30.986
What the hell is this?

40:31.006 --> 40:34.599
You're suing for full custody?
And supervised visitation?

40:34.619 --> 40:36.927
Are you out of your freaking mind?!

40:40.323 --> 40:43.459
I'm not the one who slept
with my child's nanny

40:43.479 --> 40:46.161
and wrote a book about all
the sexual things that I've done

40:46.195 --> 40:48.596
- for all the world to see.
- So this is about my book?

40:48.631 --> 40:52.334
This is about you... living in
a morally questionable universe

40:52.368 --> 40:54.502
that isn't appropriate
to raise a child in.

40:54.537 --> 40:58.306
But yes... I found your book
exploitive and disturbing.

40:58.341 --> 40:59.474
- Faith and I both did.
- [Sighs]

40:59.508 --> 41:02.477
What's gonna happen when
Vivian grows up and reads it?

41:02.511 --> 41:04.279
What's she gonna think of her mother?

41:04.313 --> 41:05.987
She'll be glad to know
that she's been raised

41:06.007 --> 41:08.016
by a self-aware truth-teller.

41:08.050 --> 41:10.685
When you're bothering to be there
and not handing her off to some nanny.

41:10.720 --> 41:12.790
Mothers rely on nannies
all over the world!

41:12.810 --> 41:15.323
Out of necessity, not when
there's another set of parents

41:15.358 --> 41:16.958
willing and able to care for the child.

41:16.993 --> 41:18.539
You and Faith are both doctors.

41:18.559 --> 41:21.329
You'll be just as busy as I am!

41:21.364 --> 41:23.365
Faith's not going back to work.

41:23.399 --> 41:25.033
She's gonna stay home.

41:25.067 --> 41:27.469
We're gonna have more children.

41:27.503 --> 41:29.170
Faith's not Vivian's mother.

41:29.205 --> 41:30.685
Maybe not.

41:30.705 --> 41:34.175
But I am Vivian's father,
and she is my wife,

41:34.210 --> 41:38.313
and she knows the proper way
to care for and raise a child.

41:40.349 --> 41:42.183
And I don't?

41:42.218 --> 41:43.418
Come on.

41:43.452 --> 41:44.486
[Scoffs]

41:44.520 --> 41:45.954
Why hold back now?

41:47.256 --> 41:49.557
[Sighs]

41:49.592 --> 41:53.042
Faith just seems more comfortable
with Vivian inherently.

41:53.992 --> 41:56.578
Not every woman has the maternal gene.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.000
Oh.

41:59.035 --> 42:01.669
I've got the gene, all right.

42:01.704 --> 42:04.176
And now you're gonna see
me fight for my child.

42:04.196 --> 42:07.409
I'm going to destroy you in court.

42:07.443 --> 42:12.213
I hoped we could be civil, but you
just messed with the wrong mother.
