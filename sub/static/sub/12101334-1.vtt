28:43.809 --> 28:44.723
- Yes.

28:48.465 --> 28:51.686
And here is my resume.

28:51.730 --> 28:52.992
There you are.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.693
- So what's your experience
working with troubled teens?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.434
- Define troubled teens.

29:00.477 --> 29:02.305
- I mean I'm assuming you
know what we do, right?

29:02.349 --> 29:03.654
- Well I viewed your website.

29:03.698 --> 29:04.917
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.875
- And I've read your reviews.

29:06.919 --> 29:08.529
- You read reviews?

29:08.572 --> 29:10.096
And what was it exactly
that attracted you

29:10.139 --> 29:12.228
to our humble place? [chuckles]

29:12.272 --> 29:13.795
- Well I was under
the impression that

29:13.839 --> 29:16.276
your school needed my services.

29:16.319 --> 29:17.886
- We do.

29:17.930 --> 29:19.975
- I mean, it's not a school.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.064
Not in a traditional sense.

29:22.108 --> 29:24.458
Most of these kids
are repeat offenders.

29:24.501 --> 29:26.634
We're just trying to
teach 'em the right thing.

29:26.677 --> 29:29.593
It's about survival,
not academics.

29:29.637 --> 29:31.291
They need basic life skills.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.162
If we can give 'em that,
keep 'em off the streets,

29:33.206 --> 29:34.598
that's a win for us.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.035
That's the goal.

29:38.646 --> 29:41.170
[knocks]

29:41.214 --> 29:42.519
- Sam.

29:42.563 --> 29:44.478
Oh.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.219
Yep, come on, let's
get you cleaned up.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.742
Mhm, mhm.

29:47.786 --> 29:50.049
All right, right here.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.398
- Come on, man.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.400
- Here, here.

29:53.443 --> 29:56.229
Yep, keep puttin'
that pressure on it.

29:56.272 --> 29:57.970
You got it.

29:58.013 --> 30:01.887
- Like I said, life
skills. [chuckles]

30:01.930 --> 30:04.237
I mean, I'ma be
honest with you.

30:04.280 --> 30:06.326
Kimberly thought we
could use your help.

30:06.369 --> 30:09.242
Said we'd be blessed
to have you. [chuckles]

30:09.285 --> 30:11.810
- Oh, so you're saying that...

30:11.853 --> 30:13.246
- When can you start?

30:13.289 --> 30:15.117
- When would you
like me to start?

30:15.161 --> 30:16.815
- Today works.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.599
- Mr. Devlin, don't
you think that it would

30:18.642 --> 30:20.862
be better if I met the
kids then sat in on

30:20.906 --> 30:23.082
one of your classes first?

30:23.125 --> 30:25.780
I mean, I don't
know your curriculum

30:25.824 --> 30:27.390
or your schedule or...

30:27.434 --> 30:29.610
- Curriculum? Schedule?

30:29.653 --> 30:32.221
Not what you're expecting, huh?

30:32.265 --> 30:36.573
- That stock image on your
website was a nice touch.

30:36.617 --> 30:39.402
When can I meet the kids?

30:39.446 --> 30:40.403
- Stop.

30:40.447 --> 30:42.841
[speaks in Spanish]

30:42.884 --> 30:44.755
- Man.

30:44.799 --> 30:45.974
So somebody speak a
little bit of Spanish,

30:46.018 --> 30:47.541
think she the mom of us.

30:47.584 --> 30:48.759
- Oh my gosh, shut up.
[Jaylen laughs]

30:48.803 --> 30:49.891
- Guys.

30:49.935 --> 30:50.761
- [Jalen] All I'm sayin' is-

30:50.805 --> 30:52.502
- Guys.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.940
This is Ms. Grace.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.202
- That's the lady I saw.

30:56.245 --> 30:57.681
- She's here to
teach you music.

30:57.725 --> 30:59.248
- Uh uh, this is our
free time Miss K.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.815
- Yeah.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.599
[phone rings]

31:02.643 --> 31:05.385
- Excuse me, I gotta take
this. I'll be right back.

31:05.428 --> 31:07.691
- I aint sign up
for no music class.

31:07.735 --> 31:10.956
- Good, because this
is music therapy.

31:10.999 --> 31:12.871
- We got counselors already.

31:12.914 --> 31:15.743
- Music therapy is
a way for you to

31:15.786 --> 31:19.790
express yourselves creatively,
with all kinds of music.

31:19.834 --> 31:21.662
- Like you want us to sing?

31:21.705 --> 31:22.924
[sucks teeth]

31:22.968 --> 31:23.751
- Nobody asked
you to sing.

31:23.794 --> 31:24.795
[laughing]

31:24.839 --> 31:26.580
- [Jalen] You so rude.

31:26.623 --> 31:28.930
- There aren't really any
rules to this kind of music.

31:28.974 --> 31:31.411
- Sounds like a waste of time.

31:31.454 --> 31:33.630
- Well could you please
hold your opinion

31:33.674 --> 31:36.546
until you find out
what it's all about?

31:36.590 --> 31:39.332
[laughing]

31:39.375 --> 31:40.246
- Yo.

31:40.289 --> 31:41.595
Yo?

31:41.638 --> 31:43.423
King of Devlin. I'm
back, what's up?

31:43.466 --> 31:46.382
- My boy, welcome back.
- What's up, what's up?

31:46.426 --> 31:47.209
What's good, dog?

31:47.253 --> 31:49.081
[hits]

31:49.124 --> 31:50.952
[laughing]

31:50.996 --> 31:53.694
Aye.
- That's not funny, bro.

31:53.737 --> 31:54.782
- Yo, I'm not cleaning that up.

31:54.825 --> 31:56.175
Y'all got me messed up.

31:56.218 --> 31:57.698
- Bro, she been here
for two seconds.

31:57.741 --> 31:59.352
- You act like you
don't know me now?

31:59.395 --> 32:00.919
What's up, you not gonna
give me no love or nothin'?

32:00.962 --> 32:03.573
- Nah, bruh, what's
good with it?

32:03.617 --> 32:05.271
You got coffee in
your hair and junk.

32:05.314 --> 32:06.402
Let's see that
bling, let's see it.

32:06.446 --> 32:07.882
- Run it, run it.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.014
- [Jalen] My god,
yeah, I like it bro.

32:09.057 --> 32:10.406
Does it itch?

32:10.450 --> 32:11.581
- [Kimberly] All
right, thank you.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.018
- How do you do this?

32:13.061 --> 32:15.759
[sighs]

32:15.803 --> 32:17.761
- Okay, look.

32:17.805 --> 32:19.415
It takes some getting used to.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.939
But I promise you
that if you just--

32:20.982 --> 32:23.942
- This was a mistake.

32:23.985 --> 32:27.249
- The kids mean well, you just-

32:27.293 --> 32:31.297
- And you call this helping me.

32:31.340 --> 32:32.689
- Grace, please,
what can we do?

32:32.733 --> 32:36.041
- Nothing. I'm fine, thank you.

32:36.084 --> 32:38.521
- What? She said she's fine.

32:38.565 --> 32:41.350
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

32:41.394 --> 32:44.397
Is it the schedule?

32:44.440 --> 32:46.399
- And you think this is funny?

32:46.442 --> 32:49.924
I have taught ambassador's
kids, and one time a prince.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.970
- Look, Jalen's
dad used to run one

32:52.013 --> 32:53.797
of the hardest
gangs on this block,

32:53.841 --> 32:57.453
so for real, for
real, we royalty too.

32:57.497 --> 32:59.760
You know my wife can make
a bad cup of coffee,

32:59.803 --> 33:01.109
but you aint have
to do all that.

33:01.153 --> 33:04.417
You could've just
thrown it away.

33:04.460 --> 33:06.767
They're kids, they're
gonna act out.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.508
I think someone from
where you're from,

33:08.551 --> 33:10.771
what is it, music
therapy, or whatever,

33:10.814 --> 33:14.427
would be more in tune with
how these at risk teens act.

33:14.470 --> 33:17.734
- My students have taught
kids from all over the world

33:17.778 --> 33:21.782
because of the skills
I knew to teach them,

33:21.825 --> 33:24.263
and you don't think I'm
qualified enough for you?

33:24.306 --> 33:26.743
- Paper says you qualified,
but it take way more

33:26.787 --> 33:28.049
than that to last.
- You don't have a schedule,

33:28.093 --> 33:30.834
you don't have curriculum.

33:30.878 --> 33:35.535
You, I'm assuming, don't
have money for supplies.

33:35.578 --> 33:38.059
- All the money goes to
the fancy universities

33:38.103 --> 33:39.713
like the one you came from.

33:39.756 --> 33:41.497
Look, we got a
saying around here:

33:41.541 --> 33:43.543
meet them where they are at.

33:43.586 --> 33:45.284
- And then?

33:45.327 --> 33:47.460
Because I'm pretty sure
I've already done that.

33:47.503 --> 33:48.896
- And that's it.

33:48.939 --> 33:51.507
Anything past
that is a calling.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.118
So where we goin'?

33:54.554 --> 33:57.339
[Grace scoffs]

33:58.558 --> 34:01.430
[birds chirping]

34:02.910 --> 34:04.520
Uh, hello?

34:06.435 --> 34:08.698
I'll get these.

34:08.742 --> 34:11.614
[birds chirping]

34:14.878 --> 34:18.012
- So we don't
usually have guests.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.580
Oh wow.

34:20.623 --> 34:24.236
I thought the kids had
it cleaned in here.

34:25.802 --> 34:26.934
[Grace coughs]
You know what,

34:26.977 --> 34:28.240
I could send some of them over.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.851
- No, that's fine. That's okay.

34:30.894 --> 34:32.331
- You sure?
- Mhm.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.246
- I really don't mind.

34:34.289 --> 34:36.335
I mean, they could clean up
some more, really, honestly.

34:36.378 --> 34:39.294
[Clears throat]

34:40.121 --> 34:42.558
Okay.

34:42.602 --> 34:46.345
Grace, I'm really
glad you're here.

34:46.388 --> 34:50.175
I think you'll be good
for us. [chuckles]

34:50.218 --> 34:51.350
Okay.

34:53.743 --> 34:55.397
All right.

34:55.441 --> 34:59.401
Well, get some rest.
Tomorrow's a new day.

34:59.445 --> 35:03.101
And again, thanks for
give us another shot.

35:05.494 --> 35:07.105
All right.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.760
[door closes]

35:11.631 --> 35:15.287
[soft music]

35:15.330 --> 35:16.940
- Just meet them
where they're at.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.290
- [Selina] 'Cause little
miss thing over there

35:18.333 --> 35:19.595
wouldn't let me
sleep last night.

35:19.639 --> 35:21.771
- Are you serious?
- Come on.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
- Good afternoon.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.908
- [Q] You know it is.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.912
- No coffee today?

35:31.955 --> 35:33.653
- I can't get with this.

35:33.696 --> 35:34.567
- Run that.

35:34.610 --> 35:35.916
- It's trash.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.222
- What?
- It's trash.

35:37.265 --> 35:38.223
- That is not trash.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.746
Trash is-

35:39.789 --> 35:42.227
- So, um, what is
good music to you?

35:44.272 --> 35:45.969
- I don't know.

35:46.013 --> 35:47.232
You just know.

35:49.799 --> 35:52.237
It's definitely not that.

35:52.280 --> 35:53.803
- What about you?

35:55.065 --> 35:56.589
- What about me what?

35:56.632 --> 35:59.635
- What do you
consider good music?

36:01.420 --> 36:04.205
Is it the song or the artist?

36:04.249 --> 36:07.687
Do the lyrics move
you in a certain way?

36:08.992 --> 36:11.212
What do you get from it?

36:11.256 --> 36:12.735
- It's not about what we get,

36:12.779 --> 36:14.781
it's about what we
don't have to get.

36:14.824 --> 36:18.219
Some of us don't wanna be
in our feelings all day.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.135
- So, music is the escape?

36:21.179 --> 36:23.529
- There's a lot worse
things than music.

36:23.572 --> 36:26.401
Uh, the people
you use to escape.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.360
- True.

36:28.403 --> 36:31.493
It's a healthy distraction.

36:31.537 --> 36:34.583
But on the other side of that,

36:34.627 --> 36:39.327
music can help us feel or
make sense of our emotions.

36:39.371 --> 36:43.157
- Like, for me, I,
I like listening to

36:43.201 --> 36:48.249
my favorite songs because
it makes me feel less alone.

36:48.293 --> 36:49.729
- So loneliness.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.384
What else?

36:52.427 --> 36:56.344
- Um, music is one of
the only things that

36:56.388 --> 36:59.869
doesn't ask for anything we
don't wanna give, I guess.

36:59.913 --> 37:01.741
- [Grace] How so?

37:01.784 --> 37:03.482
- We can listen to
it when we want to,

37:03.525 --> 37:05.397
turn it off when we don't
wanna hear it anymore.

37:05.440 --> 37:06.789
We can either get
something from it,

37:06.833 --> 37:09.139
or get nothing at
all, it just is.

37:09.183 --> 37:11.446
It lets us choose
how we wanna respond

37:11.490 --> 37:13.579
without telling
us how we should.

37:13.622 --> 37:15.363
I guess, I don't know.

37:15.407 --> 37:18.279
- That's pretty insightful.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.933
[scoffs]

37:19.976 --> 37:21.413
Do you disagree?

37:24.067 --> 37:26.331
- Just don't care.

37:26.374 --> 37:27.419
Just wondering
if there's a point

37:27.462 --> 37:29.377
to all of this or what?

37:29.421 --> 37:31.249
- Yo, chill.
- Please.

37:31.292 --> 37:34.077
Like y'all aint
wondering the same thing.

37:34.121 --> 37:35.775
This supposed to be
our time to kick back

37:35.818 --> 37:38.212
and not deal with somebody
else talking at us.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.259
- Well you know there have
been studies that suggest

37:41.302 --> 37:44.436
that babies in their
mother's wombs can hear

37:44.479 --> 37:46.742
and even recognize
the music that

37:46.786 --> 37:48.527
their mothers play for them.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.442
It can be a song, it
can be humming a song--

37:50.485 --> 37:52.531
- Don't talk to
me about my baby.

37:52.574 --> 37:54.881
- Look, I was just trying-
- That's your problem.

37:54.924 --> 37:57.449
Stop. Like, are you
even a real teacher?

37:57.492 --> 38:00.626
'Cause I aint heard
nothin' yet that matters.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.237
- [Grace] What
does matter to you?

38:03.281 --> 38:05.413
- Not this.

38:05.457 --> 38:07.807
- Well maybe not today,
but what about the future?

38:07.850 --> 38:09.417
[chuckles]

38:09.461 --> 38:13.029
That maybe later, one
day, what you learn

38:13.073 --> 38:16.076
here can impact your life.

38:16.119 --> 38:18.600
What you gonna do when
you leave this place,

38:18.644 --> 38:20.733
who you're going to be.

38:20.776 --> 38:25.912
A life outside of anything
you've ever known.

38:25.955 --> 38:30.917
Doing big things that you
never thought you could do.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.222
[scoffs]

38:32.266 --> 38:33.702
- Big?

38:33.746 --> 38:35.356
That aint us.

38:35.400 --> 38:38.011
We just trying to make
it through every day.

38:38.054 --> 38:39.752
- I can't even leave the house.

38:39.795 --> 38:42.624
- Look, Ms. Grace, was
it? We know our options.

38:42.668 --> 38:45.105
- Yup, and they suck.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.109
- Well then I've got
an important assignment

38:49.152 --> 38:50.937
for you to do tonight.
[Jaylen scoffs]

38:50.980 --> 38:52.460
- Wait, hold up, now she's
talking about assignment.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.201
Can someone please
tell this lady

38:54.244 --> 38:57.552
that we don't do homework here?

38:57.596 --> 39:00.250
- Facts.
- Yeah.

39:00.294 --> 39:01.904
- Are you telling me that
if I give you an assignment,

39:01.948 --> 39:05.255
you're not-
- No, no one would do it.

39:05.299 --> 39:08.084
I'm not trying to
be mean, but...

39:08.128 --> 39:10.652
- Not one of you
even wants to try?

39:10.696 --> 39:12.219
- I'm good.
- No.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.569
- You're just happy
doing nothing?

39:14.613 --> 39:16.832
- We do what we gotta
do to stay here.

39:16.876 --> 39:19.922
Why would we do
something we aint gotta?

39:19.966 --> 39:23.186
- Why indeed.

39:27.147 --> 39:30.019
[birds chirping]

39:34.459 --> 39:36.330
I did what you said.

39:36.374 --> 39:38.637
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.161
But where they're
at is a problem.

39:41.204 --> 39:42.858
- Huh?

39:42.902 --> 39:45.731
- You told me to meet them
where they're at. I did.

39:45.774 --> 39:48.560
But where they're
at is a problem.

39:48.603 --> 39:51.911
- Oh, I see. See, I
thought we hired a teacher.

39:51.954 --> 39:54.043
But it seems like we
just hired a judge.

39:54.087 --> 39:57.090
- No, what you did
was hire the sitter.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.744
That's what this is.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.354
- Look, I don't have
time to give you

40:00.398 --> 40:02.356
a pep talk every time
something happens.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.271
It's the job.

40:04.314 --> 40:06.752
First it was too hard for you,
now it's too easy for you.

40:06.795 --> 40:08.928
What do you want?

40:08.971 --> 40:12.279
- I want to help.
- Well then help.

40:16.762 --> 40:18.372
- I mean I'll trade you this-
- Look, I'm just saying,

40:18.416 --> 40:19.939
then keep your door closed.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.897
- Hey, if I wanna leave
my door open, it's open.

40:21.941 --> 40:23.203
[laughing]

40:23.246 --> 40:24.639
- Hey.

40:24.683 --> 40:27.642
- Are we having a sleep over?

40:27.686 --> 40:29.035
- [Q] Come on with
your big head.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.645
- You can't talk
for nobody, dog.

40:30.689 --> 40:33.213
Have you seen that
thing you carry around?

40:33.256 --> 40:35.433
- Will you be joining us?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.567
Is everyone comfortable?

40:39.611 --> 40:41.917
- Of course.
- I could use another pillow.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.745
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.486
Yeah. [laughs]

40:45.530 --> 40:47.096
- I'll catch one.

40:47.140 --> 40:49.272
[laughing]

40:49.316 --> 40:55.235
- Yes, this is really nice.

40:55.278 --> 40:56.932
Ah.

40:58.630 --> 41:02.590
And to think, I was
worried about what

41:02.634 --> 41:04.897
you all thought about me.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.421
[Grace chuckles]

41:07.465 --> 41:12.905
Racking my brain with what
I could do to help you,

41:12.948 --> 41:17.257
or where I would go
if I decided to leave.

41:17.300 --> 41:20.608
And then it finally
occurred to me:

41:20.652 --> 41:26.571
I don't have to think about
any of this stuff. [laughs]

41:26.614 --> 41:27.920
- She's loosing it.

41:27.963 --> 41:32.968
- Not if I have one
of those passes.

41:33.012 --> 41:36.406
Oh, you know what
I'm talking about?

41:36.450 --> 41:39.540
Because you all have
them, the passes.

41:39.584 --> 41:41.934
- We don't have any passes?

41:41.977 --> 41:44.980
- Oh, I'm not
gonna tell anybody.

41:45.024 --> 41:47.940
Just tell me where
you got the passes.

41:47.983 --> 41:50.551
- We stole 'em.
[laughing]

41:50.595 --> 41:52.510
- Um, passes for what?

41:53.467 --> 41:55.469
- The passes on life.

41:55.513 --> 41:59.299
The free passes that
say that all you

41:59.342 --> 42:03.390
have to do is show up
and that's good enough.

42:03.433 --> 42:08.438
The passes that say you
don't have to do the work.

42:08.482 --> 42:12.660
You talk a tough game.

42:12.704 --> 42:16.577
And you almost had
me for a minute.

42:16.621 --> 42:19.493
You intimidate and
you make your threats

42:19.537 --> 42:21.539
and you demand respect.

42:23.758 --> 42:26.761
But when it comes time to
stand up for yourselves,

42:26.805 --> 42:29.024
you throw up your
hands and you back into

42:29.068 --> 42:32.332
the corner and you cry
and you oh, I'm scared,

42:32.375 --> 42:35.378
I can't do this, it's too hard.

42:35.422 --> 42:36.815
- We know how to fight.
- Yeah.

42:36.858 --> 42:38.468
- No you don't.

42:38.512 --> 42:40.601
Not for yourselves.

42:40.645 --> 42:43.822
Now, you may have
been victimized.

42:43.865 --> 42:45.780
No fault of your own.

42:45.824 --> 42:52.439
And you may not have family,
friends, a $1.50 to your name.

42:52.482 --> 42:56.356
But you do have something,
something so powerful

42:56.399 --> 43:01.230
that no one can ever
take away from you.

43:01.274 --> 43:03.232
- What's that? Our
court records, right?

43:03.276 --> 43:04.277
[laughing]

43:04.320 --> 43:07.497
- [Grace] Choice.

43:07.541 --> 43:12.067
- Most of us were sent
here. It wasn't our choice.

43:12.111 --> 43:14.461
- That's not how it
is for most of us.

43:14.504 --> 43:17.464
Even if we wanna move on,

43:17.507 --> 43:20.293
the world doesn't
just let you forget.

43:20.336 --> 43:24.079
- But you still have a choice,

43:24.123 --> 43:28.083
to not let it define one
more moment of your lives.

43:28.127 --> 43:30.695
Just stop believing
the lies that this

43:30.738 --> 43:32.653
is all that there is.

43:32.697 --> 43:37.266
You stand up and fight. Stand
up and fight for yourselves!

43:38.790 --> 43:41.619
[sighs]

43:41.662 --> 43:43.403
Now...

43:45.623 --> 43:51.106
You, you, you can just give up.

43:51.150 --> 43:57.809
You can let the world, and
all of the bad people in it,

43:57.852 --> 44:01.682
determine your
future, and this class

44:01.726 --> 44:04.467
will be your nap time.

44:04.511 --> 44:08.428
But if you decide to
stand up for yourselves,

44:10.604 --> 44:13.520
stand up and fight
for yourselves

44:13.563 --> 44:19.482
and do something positive
with all of that negativity,

44:19.526 --> 44:25.663
all of that pain,
you just let me know.

44:27.186 --> 44:32.321
Now my future is good, no
matter what you decide.

44:33.932 --> 44:36.499
[soft music]

44:39.372 --> 44:44.507
You just let me know.
[soft music]

44:51.906 --> 44:53.081
Yes.

44:54.648 --> 44:56.432
This is good.

44:56.476 --> 44:58.608
- You said what?
- Michael.

44:58.652 --> 45:01.002
- If we only expect
the minimum from them,

45:01.046 --> 45:02.743
that is all we're going to get.

45:02.787 --> 45:04.527
And then they will never,
ever know that they

45:04.571 --> 45:06.573
are capable of so much more.

45:06.616 --> 45:08.183
- Now she's telling
me how to do my job.

45:08.227 --> 45:10.055
Unbelievable.

45:10.098 --> 45:12.361
You don't just walk up
in somebody house, Grace,

45:12.405 --> 45:14.320
and start telling
them how to clean it.

45:14.363 --> 45:18.367
- I didn't just walk in.
I was invited to stay.

45:18.411 --> 45:21.588
- Exactly. Key word:
"invited".

45:21.631 --> 45:23.416
I should've let
you walk that day.

45:23.459 --> 45:26.419
- Michael!
- Then why didn't you?

45:26.462 --> 45:27.899
[Michael sighs]

45:27.942 --> 45:29.335
- Look.

45:31.424 --> 45:33.078
I know these kids.

45:33.121 --> 45:35.733
I know what it's like
to be one of these kids.

45:35.776 --> 45:37.909
They don't call 'em
at risk for nothin'.

45:37.952 --> 45:39.737
Last thing they need is
somebody coming in here

45:39.780 --> 45:42.783
sellin' 'em dreams,
tellin' 'em more lies,

45:42.827 --> 45:44.524
leading to more disappointment.

45:44.567 --> 45:48.571
- Everybody's at risk of
something, Mr. Devlin.

45:48.615 --> 45:50.225
That's life.

45:50.269 --> 45:52.532
But we just can't, we
can't grow complacent

45:52.575 --> 45:54.752
and not try to do better.

45:55.796 --> 45:57.450
- Oh, I get it.

45:57.493 --> 45:58.712
This some of that old
recovery talk, aint it?

45:58.756 --> 46:00.496
What are you, 90
days clean now?

46:00.540 --> 46:02.063
- Okay, Michael,
that is enough.

46:02.107 --> 46:03.891
What has gotten into you?

46:03.935 --> 46:06.241
You of all people
should know better.

46:06.285 --> 46:08.287
Okay, this house would
not be in existence

46:08.330 --> 46:10.332
if you just settled
for less and stopped

46:10.376 --> 46:14.510
fighting for more, for
yourself and the kids.

46:14.554 --> 46:16.164
Now I wanna show
Grace their files.

46:16.208 --> 46:17.818
- No.

46:17.862 --> 46:18.863
- At least she'd know
where we started from.

46:18.906 --> 46:20.386
- They're private. No!

46:20.429 --> 46:22.344
- So, she could just-
- Mr. Devlin.

46:22.388 --> 46:24.433
You, you've have a
problem with me from the

46:24.477 --> 46:28.046
moment I stepped inside your
door and I don't know why,

46:28.089 --> 46:31.223
but honestly, I don't care.

46:31.266 --> 46:34.226
Because at this
point in my life,

46:34.269 --> 46:39.144
I am done with trying
to please people.

46:39.187 --> 46:44.366
And 115 days sober,
if you must know.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.239
And you're my boss.

46:47.282 --> 46:51.809
And I can respect and accept
that this is your house.

46:53.114 --> 46:56.639
- Well?
- But you gave me those kids.

46:56.683 --> 47:00.165
You stuck me in
the room with them,

47:00.208 --> 47:02.689
and as long as I'm living here,

47:02.732 --> 47:05.648
I refuse to let
my room be a mess.

47:07.433 --> 47:10.871
- Look, you two work this out.

47:10.915 --> 47:12.786
But when it all
comes falling apart,

47:12.830 --> 47:15.267
and these kids end
up spittin' bullets,

47:15.310 --> 47:17.573
you better hope to God you got
something real to give 'em.

47:17.617 --> 47:24.102
[clattering]

47:28.846 --> 47:31.022
[knocking]

47:31.065 --> 47:33.763
- Come in.

47:38.420 --> 47:41.510
- This aint me backin' down.

47:41.554 --> 47:45.297
- So you trust me, then?
- Trust might be pushin' it,

47:45.340 --> 47:47.299
but I respect your
assertiveness.

47:47.342 --> 47:49.954
It's not everyday I come across
someone as aggressive as me.

47:49.997 --> 47:51.738
[Grace chuckles]

47:51.781 --> 47:55.873
- Look, I don't wanna hurt
these kids, Mr. Devlin.

47:55.916 --> 47:58.484
[soft music]

48:03.054 --> 48:07.188
- Two years ago, they
sent us a 13-year-old boy.

48:07.232 --> 48:09.930
He couldn't speak,
he stared at walls,

48:09.974 --> 48:12.367
he wet the bed, he
couldn't even feed himself.

48:12.411 --> 48:15.283
13-years-old.

48:15.327 --> 48:17.546
And it's not like he couldn't.

48:17.590 --> 48:18.808
You look at his
early school records,

48:18.852 --> 48:21.202
it shows that he
was a smart kid.

48:21.246 --> 48:25.119
But whatever happened to
him at his parent's house?

48:25.163 --> 48:27.948
Completely checked out.

48:27.992 --> 48:30.255
The therapists and
all their credentials,

48:30.298 --> 48:32.431
they told us to keep pushin'
him, keep pushin' him,

48:32.474 --> 48:33.998
don't go easy on him.

48:34.041 --> 48:37.262
They said if we did,
he'd never recover.

48:37.305 --> 48:40.178
You can't argue with these
doctors, so that's what we did.

48:40.221 --> 48:43.964
For a year straight, all we
did was focus on results.

48:44.008 --> 48:46.227
No visible sign of success.

48:46.271 --> 48:48.229
You know what they
told us to do?

48:48.273 --> 48:49.752
Just get rid of him.

48:49.796 --> 48:52.755
Just like that,
just get rid of him.

48:54.018 --> 48:56.977
Couldn't do it.
Couldn't do it.

48:57.021 --> 48:58.979
I don't care if he
decided to check out

48:59.023 --> 49:03.679
the rest of his life, all we
were called to do was love him.

49:03.723 --> 49:06.769
Dirty, smelly,
exhausting, whatever.

49:07.988 --> 49:09.250
Just love him.

49:10.730 --> 49:22.785
- And what happened?
[soft music]

49:27.399 --> 49:30.837
You've got a good heart.

49:30.880 --> 49:34.493

back in the morning.

You shouldn't sneak
up on me like that.

1:03:45.299 --> 1:03:46.648
Come on in, come on in.
- What's all this, Ms. Grace?

1:03:46.692 --> 1:03:48.041
- Just come on in.
- Ms. Grace,

1:03:48.085 --> 1:03:50.783
you promised us no choir.
- Hey, no choir.

1:03:50.827 --> 1:03:52.437
Just instruments.

1:03:52.480 --> 1:03:54.221
Come on in, come come,
come see what we have.

1:03:54.265 --> 1:03:55.701
See what we have.
- Are you serious?

1:03:55.744 --> 1:03:58.008
- Yes I am serious.
I am very serious.

1:03:58.051 --> 1:03:59.836
Absolutely.
- If you say so. [laughs]

1:03:59.879 --> 1:04:02.447
- Let me try this one.

1:04:02.490 --> 1:04:04.797
- Now, just pick it up.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:08.105
- Oh my gosh, it's so heavy.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:09.846
And just-
- And I hold it like this?

1:04:09.889 --> 1:04:12.152
- Absolutely. Absolutely.
[soft guitar strumming]

1:04:12.196 --> 1:04:13.110
- Hey.

1:04:14.502 --> 1:04:15.939
- You look really
dumb with that.

1:04:15.982 --> 1:04:20.291
- Thanks. I appreciate
it. [chuckles]

1:04:20.334 --> 1:04:22.206
You know, I bet you have
a really nice smile.

1:04:22.249 --> 1:04:24.425
Too bad nobody gets to see it.

1:04:24.469 --> 1:04:25.600
- Yeah, well you
don't have to put

1:04:25.644 --> 1:04:27.298
up with me for much longer.

1:04:27.341 --> 1:04:30.867
- Yeah, and why is that?
- They're sending me away.

1:04:30.910 --> 1:04:32.520
- Wait, seriously?

1:04:32.564 --> 1:04:34.696
Who? Michael
and Kimberly?

1:04:34.740 --> 1:04:37.090
- Social workers.

1:04:37.134 --> 1:04:40.180
- I mean, where
are you going? Why?

1:04:43.183 --> 1:04:44.576
Did they at least
tell you when?

1:04:44.619 --> 1:04:46.708
- I don't know.

1:04:46.752 --> 1:04:48.232
Could be any day, I guess.

1:04:48.275 --> 1:04:49.668
[scoffs]

1:04:49.711 --> 1:04:51.626
- Nah, if it was
me, I'd be trippin'.

1:04:51.670 --> 1:04:55.587
I mean like, we bump heads, I
mean, but this is your home.

1:04:55.630 --> 1:04:57.502
Your family.

1:04:57.545 --> 1:05:00.418
- People are the same
no matter where you go.

1:05:00.461 --> 1:05:01.898
- I mean, how would you know?

1:05:01.941 --> 1:05:03.247
You never gave any
of us a chance.

1:05:03.290 --> 1:05:05.249
- Yeah, and now
I don't have to.

1:05:05.292 --> 1:05:07.599
Why you always gotta make
everything so personal?

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:08.992
- It' snot even like that.

1:05:09.035 --> 1:05:10.732
- I shouldn't even
have told you.

1:05:10.776 --> 1:05:11.820
- Aye, wait a second,
we could talk this out.

1:05:11.864 --> 1:05:13.431
It's not that..
serious.

1:05:15.781 --> 1:05:17.609
[sighs]

1:05:17.652 --> 1:05:21.004

[soft music]
[birds chirping]

1:05:27.053 --> 1:05:28.228
- Listen y'all, we've
been noticing a lot of

1:05:28.272 --> 1:05:30.404
holes in the walls around here.

1:05:30.448 --> 1:05:33.364
Anybody wanna own up to that?

1:05:33.407 --> 1:05:35.148
- It was the lizard?

1:05:35.192 --> 1:05:38.586
- Aye, no snitchin'.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

1:05:38.630 --> 1:05:40.153
Anyway, Daniella?

1:05:41.850 --> 1:05:45.724
Any thoughts or concerns
over the pregnancy?

1:05:45.767 --> 1:05:48.596
- I mean, I'm not
exactly looking forward

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:51.295
to pushing a head out of-
- No, I think we got it.

1:05:51.338 --> 1:05:54.124
- So we're just not gonna
talk about the situation?

1:05:54.167 --> 1:05:55.734
What are y'all doin'
to stop this, huh?

1:05:55.777 --> 1:05:57.344
How is she supposed
to prepare for a baby

1:05:57.388 --> 1:05:59.216
if she doesn't know
where she's gonna be?

1:05:59.259 --> 1:06:00.957
- You're right.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.003
We're all family, and if
anything has the potential

1:06:04.047 --> 1:06:07.398
to affect one of us, it
should affect all of us.

1:06:07.441 --> 1:06:09.313
But we're doing everything
we can to make sure

1:06:09.356 --> 1:06:11.315
Daniella does not
leave this house.

1:06:11.358 --> 1:06:12.751
- That's right.

1:06:13.926 --> 1:06:15.797
- What does she do?

1:06:15.841 --> 1:06:18.496
Mike, I've been locked
up how many times?

1:06:18.539 --> 1:06:20.411
I literally broke
into someone's house.

1:06:20.454 --> 1:06:23.153
- Q.
- No, I'm on house arrest.

1:06:23.196 --> 1:06:24.545
- Okay.
- No one's kicking me out.

1:06:24.589 --> 1:06:26.983
- Q, listen. She
didn't do anything.

1:06:27.026 --> 1:06:28.027
It's her case workers,
okay?

1:06:28.071 --> 1:06:29.420
They just, they-

1:06:31.813 --> 1:06:34.207
They just want what's
best for her and the baby.

1:06:34.251 --> 1:06:35.382
[Jaylen scoffs]

1:06:35.426 --> 1:06:37.036
- By sending me to Heflin Hall?

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.560
- Look, I don't
even like Daniella.

1:06:39.604 --> 1:06:41.736
But I wouldn't want
her to go there.

1:06:41.780 --> 1:06:42.999
The place is bad.

1:06:43.042 --> 1:06:45.610
- I thought we were safe here.

1:06:47.220 --> 1:06:48.961
And now you're
telling me that we

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:51.007
can get thrown out just
by doing nothin' wrong?

1:06:51.050 --> 1:06:52.356
- See that's why I
aint wanna say nothin'.

1:06:52.399 --> 1:06:54.271
Aint no point of
getting all worked up

1:06:54.314 --> 1:06:57.448
over something that's probably
not even gonna happen.

1:06:57.491 --> 1:07:01.017
Listen, Daniella will not
be leaving this house.

1:07:01.060 --> 1:07:03.019
You have my word.

1:07:03.062 --> 1:07:06.718
And if you know anything about
me, you know my word is good.

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:08.067
Now let's pray.

[insects buzzing]

1:07:18.643 --> 1:07:21.080
- Mind if I sit out
here with you for a bit?

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:22.864
- Can't sleep?

1:07:22.908 --> 1:07:23.822
- Nope.

1:07:27.434 --> 1:07:29.610
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1:07:31.743 --> 1:07:34.702
[insects buzzing]

1:07:36.269 --> 1:07:39.577
- What do you wanna
do with your life?

1:07:40.795 --> 1:07:42.928
There must be something.

1:07:46.105 --> 1:07:49.239
- I want my mom
to wanna see me.

1:07:49.282 --> 1:07:51.937
- She doesn't wanna see you?

1:07:51.980 --> 1:07:53.417
- She told me the only reason

1:07:53.460 --> 1:07:56.333
she kept me around
was for the check.

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:57.595
Said if it wasn't
for the check,

1:07:57.638 --> 1:08:00.424
she would've got
rid of me a long...

1:08:01.599 --> 1:08:05.733
long time ago.
[soft music]

1:08:05.777 --> 1:08:08.997
- So why do you wanna see her?

1:08:09.041 --> 1:08:10.738
- She's still my
mother, you know?

1:08:10.782 --> 1:08:13.567
I still want her
to be straight.

1:08:17.963 --> 1:08:20.226
Anyways, enough about
me. How about you?

1:08:20.270 --> 1:08:22.098
I mean, I see you
leaving the house

1:08:22.141 --> 1:08:24.448
every Sunday afternoon
around the same time.

1:08:24.491 --> 1:08:27.668
Not that I'm a creep or a
stalker or nothin' like that.

1:08:27.712 --> 1:08:31.933
It's just, I see you
leave and come back.

1:08:31.977 --> 1:08:36.242
- I go to AA meetings. I'm
a recovering alcoholic.

1:08:37.156 --> 1:08:38.853
I go on Thursdays, too.

1:08:42.553 --> 1:08:44.729
Wow, I don't know.

1:08:44.772 --> 1:08:49.647
You just to have it all
so together, you know?

1:08:49.690 --> 1:08:52.737
- [Grace] Everybody's
got struggles.

1:08:54.608 --> 1:08:58.656
- You know, I stopped
dreaming a long time ago.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:01.267
But since you've been here,
I mean, I'm dreaming again.

1:09:01.311 --> 1:09:04.488
And I don't know
what that means yet.

1:09:05.619 --> 1:09:08.318
But I hope it's something good.

1:09:09.841 --> 1:09:11.843
- Me, too.

1:09:11.886 --> 1:09:14.193
- Thanks. For the candy.

1:09:14.237 --> 1:09:17.544

night, Ms. Grace.

of you waking me up

1:09:48.096 --> 1:09:50.882
in the middle of
the night, God.

1:09:52.275 --> 1:09:54.233
I mean, because
you don't sleep,

1:09:54.277 --> 1:09:56.583
I shouldn't sleep either?

1:09:56.627 --> 1:09:58.716
[sighs]

1:09:58.759 --> 1:10:01.284
Couldn't we do this
in the morning,

after I've had my coffee?

what your father wanted.

- Mine.
- I know.

let you have that picture.

- There's gotta be another way.

- We've exhausted
every option, Grace.

1:12:30.607 --> 1:12:32.304
Other than going
out on our own,

1:12:32.348 --> 1:12:33.523
that's the only thing left.

1:12:35.133 --> 1:12:36.656
Go off on your own.

1:12:39.137 --> 1:12:41.269
If we do that, we run the
risk of losing everything,

1:12:41.313 --> 1:12:43.533
maybe even the house.

- They can't take your house.

1:12:47.972 --> 1:12:49.887
- We still got the mortgage.

If we lose our funding, for
my salary, Kimberly's salary,

1:12:53.151 --> 1:12:55.936
and our medical insurance...

1:12:55.980 --> 1:12:57.808
- What about grants?

I know that there are grants
for communities like this.

That's why we stayed
under their umbrella.

1:13:41.286 --> 1:13:42.983
- What is that?

1:13:43.027 --> 1:13:43.810
- I wrote it.

1:13:43.854 --> 1:13:45.290
For you.

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:49.076
- And you're giving
it to me because?

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.383
- It's for you. [laughs]

1:13:51.427 --> 1:13:54.081
Thought that was implied.

1:13:54.125 --> 1:13:55.605
- You're not scared
I'm gonna slap

1:13:55.648 --> 1:13:58.521
you in the face like
your mom or whatever?

1:14:00.523 --> 1:14:02.916
- You know what? Forget it.

1:14:04.831 --> 1:14:07.443
Look, one of these
days, you're gonna need

1:14:07.486 --> 1:14:09.488
somebody in your corner,
and if it's not me,

1:14:09.532 --> 1:14:11.142
fine, that's whatever.

a friend, a true one.

1:14:14.188 --> 1:14:15.929
- So you find out I'm
leaving and all of a sudden,

1:14:15.973 --> 1:14:18.279
you wanna be my friend?

1:14:18.323 --> 1:14:21.239
Feels a little convenient,
don't you think?

1:14:21.282 --> 1:14:24.416
- You just don't
get it, do you?

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:25.373
I'm done.

1:14:27.288 --> 1:14:40.867
[melancholy music]

1:14:45.524 --> 1:14:47.744
- Langston, if you
just hear me out,

1:14:47.787 --> 1:14:50.311
you'll see that the
Devlin House is everything

1:14:50.355 --> 1:14:54.185
that we used to dream
about being a part of.

1:14:54.228 --> 1:14:55.665
- The projects
that we've chosen

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:57.971
have large-scale,
global impact.

1:14:58.015 --> 1:15:00.104
That was your idea
from the beginning.

1:15:00.147 --> 1:15:01.975
You want us to just
set those aside

1:15:02.019 --> 1:15:04.238
and focus on a house
with a handful of kids

1:15:04.282 --> 1:15:05.631
from a dying community?

1:15:05.675 --> 1:15:07.067
- Just come.
- Grace.

1:15:07.111 --> 1:15:08.025
- Just come. Come
meet the kids.

1:15:08.068 --> 1:15:09.461
See the kids, listen.

1:15:09.505 --> 1:15:10.636
- This house is just
one of thousands

1:15:10.680 --> 1:15:12.551
of programs that need our help.

1:15:12.595 --> 1:15:15.293
We can't save them all.

1:15:15.336 --> 1:15:17.251
[Langston sighs]

1:15:17.295 --> 1:15:21.517
Look, I'm worried
about you burning out.

1:15:21.560 --> 1:15:24.215
That's the last thing you
need during a recovery.

1:15:24.258 --> 1:15:27.435
- Langston, I've
never felt so alive.

1:15:28.959 --> 1:15:30.830
Nice catching up.

1:15:30.874 --> 1:15:35.879
[soft music]

1:15:42.581 --> 1:15:45.671
- Can't we do like a bake
sale or a raffle or somethin'?

1:15:45.715 --> 1:15:49.153
Isn't that what people
do when they need money?

1:15:49.196 --> 1:15:51.329
- I vote bake sale.

1:15:51.372 --> 1:15:52.809
I could get with some edibles.

1:15:52.852 --> 1:15:54.158
- Okay, dude, those
kind of edibles

1:15:54.201 --> 1:15:56.769
will get you locked up again.

1:15:56.813 --> 1:15:58.379
- That's it.

1:15:58.423 --> 1:15:59.990
- Really?

1:16:00.033 --> 1:16:01.426
- Okay, Selina does
have a point, though.

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:02.601
I can't be caught
with anything.

1:16:02.645 --> 1:16:04.908
- Uh-uh, no Q, no.

1:16:04.951 --> 1:16:08.781
I'm talking about a fundraiser.

1:16:08.825 --> 1:16:10.609
A concert.

1:16:10.653 --> 1:16:13.003
- Yeah, no disrespect, but
that's a terrible idea.

1:16:13.046 --> 1:16:15.745
- Yeah, Ms. Grace, and
you promised us no choir.

1:16:15.788 --> 1:16:17.616
- A showcase, then.

1:16:17.660 --> 1:16:19.705
You don't have to sing.

1:16:19.749 --> 1:16:22.360
Jalen, you'll write.

1:16:22.403 --> 1:16:24.884
It's time for you to
show this community

1:16:24.928 --> 1:16:27.017
the power of your words.

1:16:27.060 --> 1:16:29.759
And Tay, I've seen
your paintings.

1:16:29.802 --> 1:16:31.238
You are amazing.

1:16:31.282 --> 1:16:33.937
We can sell your artwork.

1:16:33.980 --> 1:16:35.852
And I'm sure that
there's at least someone

1:16:35.895 --> 1:16:37.331
here who can sing.

1:16:37.375 --> 1:16:39.420
- Okay wait, let me
get this straight.

1:16:39.464 --> 1:16:42.206
You want us to do all of
this for Daniella, right?

1:16:42.249 --> 1:16:43.511
- [Grace] Yes.

1:16:45.775 --> 1:16:48.038
- Think about it, you guys.

1:16:48.081 --> 1:16:49.605
Would she do that for us?

1:16:49.648 --> 1:16:50.649
- No.

1:16:50.693 --> 1:16:51.868
- No.
- Nope.

1:16:51.911 --> 1:16:54.740
- Look, you all
want to be safe.

1:16:54.784 --> 1:16:57.743
We can raise enough money
to go out on our own

1:16:57.787 --> 1:17:00.528
so that we're no longer
underneath this organization

1:17:00.572 --> 1:17:04.663
that doesn't care about you
the way that the Devlin's do.

1:17:04.707 --> 1:17:07.361
And, at the very
least, we can gain some

1:17:07.405 --> 1:17:09.929
support from the community.

1:17:09.973 --> 1:17:13.237
This thing that's
happening with Daniella,

1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:18.808
this is only a small part
of a big, big problem.

1:17:18.851 --> 1:17:21.506
Now, you wanna take
your power back?

1:17:21.549 --> 1:17:25.641
This is your chance
to stand up and fight.

1:17:27.338 --> 1:17:29.862
- [Jalen] I've got you.

1:17:29.906 --> 1:17:33.257
- We really gonna do
this, Mr. Michael?

1:17:33.300 --> 1:17:34.301
- For real.

1:17:37.000 --> 1:17:39.219
[chuckles]
- All right, everybody.

1:17:39.263 --> 1:17:41.134
The photographer's
gonna be here in an hour

1:17:41.178 --> 1:17:45.051
and they wanna do a story on
the house and the showcase.

1:17:45.095 --> 1:17:46.400
- [Jalen] That's right.

1:17:46.444 --> 1:17:47.924
- Are you kidding?
- Newspaper bro.

1:17:47.967 --> 1:17:49.316
We're gonna be famous,
my guy, famous.

1:17:54.844 --> 1:17:55.932
You kidding me right now?

1:17:55.975 --> 1:17:57.716
- Hold up, Sam.

1:17:57.760 --> 1:17:59.805
It's all right, it's all right.

1:17:59.849 --> 1:18:01.589

- He can't help it.

1:18:01.633 --> 1:18:03.156
You guys know he can't help it.

1:18:03.200 --> 1:18:05.202

- It's okay, baby.

It's all right. It's all right.

How long has this
been going on?

1:18:10.947 --> 1:18:16.430
- It happens mostly when
I'm distressed or excited.

1:18:16.474 --> 1:18:20.086
I don't know. It's
just, I guess I'm weird.

1:18:20.130 --> 1:18:23.089
It does wonders for my clout.

1:18:23.133 --> 1:18:25.439
- There's something
special about you.

1:18:25.483 --> 1:18:27.572
- Right.
- Something rare,

1:18:27.615 --> 1:18:31.489

gonna change people.

- Right.
- Yes.

- Trailer trash with
meth head parents.

your future, your family,

or where you're going, baby.

I don't wanna make posters.

1:18:52.292 --> 1:18:55.774
- I don't wanna make posters.
- Okay.

1:18:55.818 --> 1:18:58.734

like to do, Sam?

1:27:32.334 --> 1:27:35.902
I don't have time to pretend.

1:27:35.946 --> 1:27:38.731
What did you do with my baby?

1:27:41.430 --> 1:27:44.563
You know. You tell
me who took him.

1:27:47.131 --> 1:27:49.264
Just give me that.

1:27:50.961 --> 1:27:53.877
- I don't, I don't know.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:58.447
- You are the most
selfish man I've ever met.

1:27:58.490 --> 1:28:00.100
- [Solomon] Grace.

1:28:01.885 --> 1:28:05.497
- What did you do with my baby?

1:28:07.369 --> 1:28:09.109
- I don't know.

1:28:10.676 --> 1:28:12.939
I signed papers.

1:28:15.115 --> 1:28:18.075
It said you were
to give him away.

1:28:18.989 --> 1:28:21.252
I'm sorry, Grace.

1:28:22.122 --> 1:28:24.081
I'm sorry, Grace.

1:28:26.257 --> 1:28:28.999
I'm sorry for everything.

1:28:29.042 --> 1:28:30.653
- I'm sorry?

1:28:33.395 --> 1:28:36.180
You can destroy
a person's life,

1:28:38.530 --> 1:28:43.535
your only child.
your daughter,

1:28:43.579 --> 1:28:46.712
just like that,

1:28:46.756 --> 1:28:49.541
and then what, one
day you see the light

1:28:49.585 --> 1:28:53.763
and you think that I
am sorry is enough?

1:28:56.983 --> 1:29:03.816
- I don't deserve to be
forgiven for what I've done.

1:29:06.297 --> 1:29:08.517
I deserve this.

1:29:16.873 --> 1:29:24.750
- I forgive you,
Pastor Solomon Grant.

1:29:29.451 --> 1:29:30.713
I forgive you.

1:29:56.956 --> 1:29:58.567
- You can't leave me
in this house, man.

1:29:58.610 --> 1:30:00.482
- Listen, bro, we love you bro.

1:30:00.525 --> 1:30:01.961
- Get out
of my face, man!

1:30:02.005 --> 1:30:02.745
- We're here for you.
[Jalen yelling]

1:30:02.788 --> 1:30:04.224
It's okay.

1:30:04.268 --> 1:30:05.748
- You can't keep me
in this house!

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:07.053
- It's okay, I
understand, I'm sorry.

1:30:07.097 --> 1:30:10.317
I'm sorry.
[Jalen yelling]

1:30:11.536 --> 1:30:13.277
- What, sweetie?
- Ms. Grace.

1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:16.062
- What, what, what?

1:30:16.106 --> 1:30:17.499
- You can't keep me
in this house.

1:30:17.542 --> 1:30:18.717
Get out
of my face, man.

1:30:18.761 --> 1:30:21.154
- Jalen. Jalen, what's wrong?

1:30:21.198 --> 1:30:23.243
What's wrong,
honey? What's wrong?

1:30:23.287 --> 1:30:25.507
[Jalen sobbing]

1:30:25.550 --> 1:30:26.725
- She's dead.

1:30:28.945 --> 1:30:31.426
My mom is dead.
- Oh, baby.

1:30:31.469 --> 1:30:34.385
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

1:30:34.429 --> 1:30:35.647
I am so sorry.

1:30:39.564 --> 1:30:41.653
- They told me that
she wanted to see me,

1:30:41.697 --> 1:30:45.831
but she just, she just
wanted another fix.

1:30:45.875 --> 1:30:47.877
She got what she wanted,
and it killed her.

1:30:47.920 --> 1:30:49.879
- Oh, sweetie.

1:30:49.922 --> 1:30:53.099
No, no. No, no,
no, no, sweetheart.

1:30:53.143 --> 1:30:55.058
It's not your fault.

1:30:55.101 --> 1:30:59.541
It is not your fault,
and as hard as it is,

1:30:59.584 --> 1:31:05.634
as hard as it is, you're
gonna have to forgive her.

1:31:05.677 --> 1:31:07.070
It's all right.

1:31:08.767 --> 1:31:10.900
I've got you.

1:31:12.771 --> 1:31:17.907
[soft piano music]

1:31:40.059 --> 1:31:43.106
- My father was king of the
streets, so I'm royalty.

1:31:43.149 --> 1:31:45.456
My mother was his queen,
but she fell hard.

1:31:45.500 --> 1:31:48.633
It's crazy how you change
and substances get involved.

1:31:48.677 --> 1:31:50.243
She said she loved me
with her whole heart

1:31:50.287 --> 1:31:52.158
but the love never got to me.

1:31:52.202 --> 1:31:54.726
I guess it got clogged behind
the drugs in her arteries.

1:31:54.770 --> 1:31:56.467
She left me low
while she got high,

1:31:56.511 --> 1:31:58.556
'til I was at a make
shift grave saying goodbye

1:31:58.600 --> 1:32:00.776
with her ashes in a can.

1:32:00.819 --> 1:32:02.299
My dad was in jail,
then he was free,

1:32:02.342 --> 1:32:03.648
then he was shot
like the next day,

1:32:03.692 --> 1:32:05.520
so what's that say to me?

1:32:05.563 --> 1:32:07.826
By the time I was eight, I
was with a foster family,

1:32:07.870 --> 1:32:10.960
by nine, it was another,
until I was put in a house

1:32:11.003 --> 1:32:13.397
that turned into a home
and became a family,

1:32:13.440 --> 1:32:15.138
so now I'm not alone.

1:32:15.181 --> 1:32:16.748
To let go of the pain, I
put my heart into my writing

1:32:16.792 --> 1:32:18.402
and I let my soul explain.

1:32:18.445 --> 1:32:20.535
Now this boy's no longer
a child and this man,

1:32:20.578 --> 1:32:22.406
he will proclaim.

1:32:22.449 --> 1:32:24.800
I just proclaim someone out
there hears what I'm sayin'

1:32:24.843 --> 1:32:27.716
and they can see the old me
is gone and now I'm changin'.

1:32:27.759 --> 1:32:30.762
Step by step, I
strive to maintain it.

1:32:30.806 --> 1:32:33.156
And that's the story
of Harris-comma-Jalen.

1:32:41.817 --> 1:32:44.863

we are not asking you

1:32:44.907 --> 1:32:48.214
to give what you don't have.

1:32:48.258 --> 1:32:50.739
But we are asking
that you pray,

1:32:50.782 --> 1:32:53.829
and that you give
what you can give.

1:32:53.872 --> 1:32:56.309
That you will volunteer.

1:32:56.353 --> 1:33:00.444
That you will make this
community the community

1:33:00.487 --> 1:33:02.707
that you want it to be.

1:33:02.751 --> 1:33:05.623
We're asking you
to take it back.

1:33:05.667 --> 1:33:09.845
Because when we do
invest in each other,

1:33:09.888 --> 1:33:13.239
then we determine our future.

I, I didn't know you were here.

1:33:27.776 --> 1:33:29.734
- You think I'd miss this?

1:33:29.778 --> 1:33:33.085
A long time ago, I was
just like these kids.

1:33:33.129 --> 1:33:36.306
- Well thank you for
all of your help.

1:33:36.349 --> 1:33:38.874
- Thank you.

1:33:38.917 --> 1:33:41.616
You've been a real inspiration.

1:33:42.834 --> 1:33:45.620
You've inspired
me to do better.

1:33:46.751 --> 1:33:48.013
To be better.

1:34:17.086 --> 1:34:19.044
- What's wrong?

1:34:19.088 --> 1:34:20.567

Okay.

1:34:27.313 --> 1:34:28.706
Go ahead, I'll be out.

1:34:28.750 --> 1:34:29.751
I'm coming.

1:34:33.580 --> 1:34:36.714
Ooh. [sighs]

1:34:46.985 --> 1:34:48.639
- Listen.

1:34:48.683 --> 1:34:49.771
I know you and
the kids put a lot

1:34:49.814 --> 1:34:52.034
of effort into the showcase,

1:34:52.077 --> 1:34:55.385
but sometimes God
has other plans,

1:34:55.428 --> 1:34:57.213
and wants to denounce
our affiliation with

1:34:57.256 --> 1:34:59.824
the organization.

1:34:59.868 --> 1:35:04.220
- You know what, no.
No, we won't give up.

1:35:04.263 --> 1:35:06.875
- Do you know a man by
the name of Langston?

1:35:06.918 --> 1:35:08.050
- Yes.

1:35:08.093 --> 1:35:09.878
- Well, he called this morning,

1:35:09.921 --> 1:35:13.708
and he wants to award
us a large grant.

1:35:13.751 --> 1:35:16.580
This grant is gonna
last the entire lifespan

1:35:16.623 --> 1:35:20.236

- What do you mean?

1:35:52.442 --> 1:35:54.661

out this afternoon.

I mean, I don't know,
I guess all the stress

1:36:05.324 --> 1:36:08.806

wanting a baby so God,

1:36:08.850 --> 1:36:11.243
he just felt the
need to remind me.

that's wonderful.

better equipped to be parents.

Better get over there and
see what they're up to.

much noise. [laughs]
