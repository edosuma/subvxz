09:42.115 --> 09:45.650
unless she was willing to risk
a military confrontation.

09:45.652 --> 09:48.853
I didn't think Elizabeth would
escalate to violence so quickly.

09:48.855 --> 09:52.090
I sent a letter to King Philip
asking for Spain's support

09:52.092 --> 09:53.758
if England should invade,

09:53.760 --> 09:55.093
but I'm not going to
get an answer by tonight.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.361
Then Scotland is on its own.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.863
And we're not ready for this.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.632
But we can't cancel
the celebration,

10:00.634 --> 10:02.417
guests are already en route.

10:02.418 --> 10:04.201
Then you need to decide
if this marriage

10:04.204 --> 10:06.204
is worth it,
because the English

10:06.206 --> 10:07.906
are coming tonight,
and if you defy them...

10:07.908 --> 10:09.774
It will be war.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.918
I have good news for you,
Agatha.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.353
There's a physician
here to see you,

10:21.355 --> 10:23.722
and he has come
all the way across the sea

10:23.724 --> 10:24.956
to make you feel better.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.192
What kind of boat
did he take?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.126
A galleon.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.395
And he is the very best

10:30.397 --> 10:32.697
doctor in the whole world.

10:32.699 --> 10:35.000
Hello, young lady.
I am Viktor Kozlov.

10:35.002 --> 10:36.267
I am going to listen
to your heart

10:36.269 --> 10:38.269
and lungs now,
all right?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.943
I can't believe you were able
to bring Kozlov here.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.312
I promised you
I would do everything

10:47.314 --> 10:49.347
in my power to help
and I meant it.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.183
No one has studied fevers
more extensively than Kozlov.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.718
Have faith.

No, I haven't.

You know that your sister
mustn't find out

11:12.139 --> 11:14.072
that the king has fled his post.

11:14.074 --> 11:16.074
Does Luc know?

11:16.076 --> 11:17.676
Narcisse told him.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.377
Leith knows as well,

11:19.379 --> 11:20.745
but we can trust him.

11:20.747 --> 11:22.380
I'm surprised that Leith

11:22.382 --> 11:24.783
has decided to stay at court,

11:24.785 --> 11:27.686
now that you are wed
to another.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.288
Actually, we settled on
a practical arrangement

11:30.290 --> 11:31.356
between the three of us.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.425
Don't give me
that look.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.894
It's working
nicely so far.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.929
By day I appear as Luc's wife

11:37.931 --> 11:40.765
and on select occasions
we'll try to conceive an heir.

11:40.767 --> 11:43.468
But discreetly, I spend my
nights and mornings with Leith.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.370
How progressive of you.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.805
And how long
has that been going on?

11:46.807 --> 11:48.173
Two weeks?

11:48.175 --> 11:50.709
I was in a similar arrangement
with your father

11:50.711 --> 11:52.911
for years.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.747
It was about as much my
choosing as it is Leith's.

11:57.417 --> 12:00.151
watching someone you love

12:00.153 --> 12:03.488
share their body with another
poisons the heart.

12:03.490 --> 12:06.891
Hello, my wonderful family!

12:06.893 --> 12:09.294
CATHERINE:
Leeza, welcome back.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.932
What's this?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.500
It seems the royal family
is one member short.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.202
CATHERINE:
Well, Charles has retired

12:17.204 --> 12:19.370
to a monastery in Reims,

12:19.372 --> 12:20.939
for a period of
seclusion and prayer.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.440
Would this retreat
have anything to do

12:22.442 --> 12:23.475
with the rumors
I've been hearing?

12:23.477 --> 12:25.076
Something about baby-eating,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.344
and so forth?

12:26.346 --> 12:27.378
NARCISSE:
Vicious lies

12:27.380 --> 12:29.013
spread by treasonous peasants.

12:29.015 --> 12:30.348
CATHERINE:
Well, we all know

12:30.350 --> 12:32.083
that Charles has been having
a difficult time,

12:32.085 --> 12:33.518
but nothing out
of the ordinary.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.521
He's just getting the rest and

12:36.523 --> 12:39.257
the spiritual comfort
that he needs.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.526
Well, I'm famished.

12:41.528 --> 12:42.861
Shall we eat?

12:42.863 --> 12:44.929
Actually,
it's rather important

12:44.931 --> 12:47.065
that I speak
to Charles about Scotland.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.299
What? Is Mary all right?

12:48.301 --> 12:50.368
For now. But she's written

12:50.370 --> 12:51.770
to my husband Philip,

12:51.772 --> 12:53.438
asking Spain
to promise military support

12:53.440 --> 12:55.540
in the event that
England invades.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.408
Now, you know how we feel
about Protestant nations,

12:57.410 --> 13:00.812
but for my husband
to commit military forces,

13:00.814 --> 13:02.046
well, we would want France
to contribute as well.

13:02.048 --> 13:03.448
A Catholic alliance.

13:03.450 --> 13:04.449
Well, I think that
France will endorse...

13:04.451 --> 13:06.050
Could someone with an actual

13:06.052 --> 13:08.052
position here at court weigh in?

13:08.054 --> 13:11.055
As a Catholic hard-liner,

13:11.057 --> 13:12.490
I have always believed

13:12.492 --> 13:15.460
that what is good for
Scotland is good for France.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.229
No, you haven't,
you just despise England.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.232
But if the lord
chancellor agrees...

13:21.234 --> 13:24.169
I'll need something
in writing from Charles.

13:24.171 --> 13:26.037
Which monastery
did you say he was at?

13:26.039 --> 13:27.372
Uh...
He's all the way
in Reims.

13:27.374 --> 13:28.873
And you, you poor thing,

13:28.875 --> 13:30.175
you've been traveling
for weeks.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.409
I will go

13:31.411 --> 13:33.044
and fetch the signature at once.

13:33.046 --> 13:34.913
I can be back with the edict
in a day's time.

13:34.915 --> 13:37.348
Why would the queen mother go?

13:37.350 --> 13:39.250
Because Charles
needs convincing

13:39.252 --> 13:40.552
to do anything of substance.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.020
You know that.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.822
Very well, Mother.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.290
Godspeed.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.861
Luc. Claude. How are you
enjoying married life?

13:49.863 --> 13:52.330
I assume you are
now going to craft

13:52.332 --> 13:54.032
the signature of the king.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.501
I'm going to need a day or two
to fulfill the illusion.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.536
Keep your eye on Leeza
at all times.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.071
If she goes snooping
around and finds out

14:00.073 --> 14:02.440
that the king has fled,
we are lost.

<i> You have an extraordinary</i>

14:13.854 --> 14:15.086
She's a fighter.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.421
Can you help her?

14:16.423 --> 14:17.956
There is a medicinal compound

14:17.958 --> 14:19.524
that I have used
with some success

14:19.526 --> 14:21.960
in cases similar to Agatha's.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.595
I could, if possible,
prepare some.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.296
What would prevent you?

14:25.298 --> 14:26.598
The principle ingredient
is an extract

14:26.600 --> 14:28.433
from the petals
of a rare blue flower,

14:28.435 --> 14:30.301
a type of rose.

14:30.303 --> 14:32.337
It's quite costly to obtain.

14:32.339 --> 14:34.339
Cost is not an issue.

14:34.341 --> 14:37.275
You must understand,

14:37.277 --> 14:38.610
there's no guarantee that

14:38.612 --> 14:40.044
this treatment will work.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.479
But I will contact my supplier.

14:41.481 --> 14:44.349
If the roses are available,

14:44.351 --> 14:45.884
I'll begin at once.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.654
See?
He can help her.

14:49.656 --> 14:52.390
Well, if the flower's available.

14:52.392 --> 14:53.992
If she responds
to the treatment.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.326
Gideon,

14:55.328 --> 14:57.028
everything
is going to be all right.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.463
Oh, stop saying that.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.631
Stop making promises

14:59.633 --> 15:01.065
you don't have
the power to keep.

15:02.235 --> 15:06.971
I-I just... need to be with her.

15:09.643 --> 15:11.309
Am I supposed to be intimidated

15:11.311 --> 15:13.044
because England is threatening
to send troops?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.480
Elizabeth wouldn't risk
a full-scale assault

15:15.482 --> 15:17.048
just to capture me.

15:17.050 --> 15:19.083
I have powerful Catholic friends
across the borders

15:19.085 --> 15:21.920
who would make her life
very unpleasant if she did.

15:21.922 --> 15:25.056
Perhaps you're overestimating
your popularity in England,

15:25.058 --> 15:27.058
and underestimating Elizabeth.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.928
We can't be sure she hasn't made
Catholic friends of her own.

15:29.930 --> 15:30.929
Darnley, I know

15:30.931 --> 15:32.630
that we've been defiant

15:32.632 --> 15:35.566
with the English,
but tensions are escalating.

15:35.568 --> 15:37.602
We need to take
this threat seriously.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.437
James has called
for reinforcements

15:39.439 --> 15:40.939
to guard the castle.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.973
Good.

15:41.975 --> 15:43.641
Then our engagement celebrations

15:43.643 --> 15:45.310
can continue as planned.

15:45.312 --> 15:48.179
If the English do come,
we can stand our ground.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.480
Mary and I have been talking.

15:49.482 --> 15:52.350
If we refuse
those English troops,

15:52.352 --> 15:55.687
if we stand our ground, as you
say, and they stand theirs,

15:55.689 --> 15:58.122
this could turn
into a military confrontation.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.991
Scotland is not ready for a war,

15:59.993 --> 16:01.693
not yet, but if you are not here

16:01.695 --> 16:04.262
when they come, then there
will be no standoff.

16:04.264 --> 16:06.030
I will make an excuse
at the party,

16:06.032 --> 16:08.333
and you will remain in
a safe house, under guard,

16:08.335 --> 16:09.701
until the English
leave Edinburgh.

16:09.703 --> 16:13.705
You want me to be absent
from our own royal ceremony?

16:13.707 --> 16:16.007
It's the only way
to keep the peace.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.508
Our allies are traveling

16:17.510 --> 16:19.577
great distances to
pledge their support

16:19.579 --> 16:21.446
for our marriage
and our reign.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.047
What will they think if I just
suddenly run and hide?

16:23.049 --> 16:25.016
This isn't about you.

16:25.018 --> 16:26.751
This isn't about
what people might think

16:26.753 --> 16:28.586
about you, Darnley.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.288
This is about the
future of Scotland!

16:30.290 --> 16:33.391
Mary and I are
the future of Scotland.

16:33.393 --> 16:35.393
Face it,
you became redundant here

16:35.395 --> 16:36.694
the day I arrived.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.529
That's enough!

16:38.531 --> 16:39.764
(sighs)

16:39.766 --> 16:40.732
James...

16:42.402 --> 16:43.768
leave us.

16:49.642 --> 16:52.610
(door closes)
Do you really
want to send me away?

16:52.612 --> 16:54.612
It's a practical solution.

16:54.614 --> 16:56.614
It's convenient, for you.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.684
Look, I have to ask,

16:59.686 --> 17:01.219
are you avoiding me?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.757
Well, you must admit,
the timing is curious.

17:08.061 --> 17:10.528
I thought that we were
growing closer day by day.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.764
What's changed?
I don't know.

17:12.766 --> 17:14.766
But my feelings don't matter.

17:14.768 --> 17:17.201
We are facing a credible
threat from the English queen,

17:17.203 --> 17:19.670
and we must do what is right
for Scotland.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.040
I need you to stay away.

17:22.042 --> 17:24.075
Until all of this blows over.

17:24.077 --> 17:27.078
Is that a request or a command?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.213
Both.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.646
Go, be with her.

19:11.518 --> 19:13.184
Doctor, what happened
to your fingers?

19:13.186 --> 19:14.452
Are they burnt?

19:14.454 --> 19:15.620
It's a dry skin condition,

19:15.622 --> 19:17.188
embarrassing to say the least.

19:17.190 --> 19:18.389
I can save lives,

19:18.391 --> 19:19.924
but I can't seem to treat this.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.425
Excuse me.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.664
(festive music in the distance)

19:26.666 --> 19:29.467
(laughter and
indistinct conversations)

19:29.469 --> 19:30.601
Is it just me,

19:30.603 --> 19:32.703
or is this party
rather depressing?

19:32.705 --> 19:33.871
(chuckles)
I mean it.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.339
Mary's celebrating
her engagement

19:35.341 --> 19:36.541
without her fiancé,

19:36.543 --> 19:37.542
Queen Catherine
was too busy

19:37.544 --> 19:38.876
to leave France and attend,

19:38.878 --> 19:40.811
and you're holding court
with an abandoned woman

19:40.813 --> 19:42.313
out of pity.
I don't spend time

19:42.315 --> 19:44.215
with a beautiful woman
out of pity.

19:44.217 --> 19:45.716
For the record,

19:45.718 --> 19:47.652
I think Castleroy was a fool
to leave you.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.320
You're very kind, James.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.722
(whispers indistinctly)

19:51.724 --> 19:53.558
Excuse me.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.596
They're here.

19:58.598 --> 20:01.232
Our scouts report
15 English soldiers.

20:01.234 --> 20:04.969
If Elizabeth seeks to intimidate
us, why only send 15 men?

20:10.210 --> 20:12.310
(music stops, crowd murmurs)

20:13.613 --> 20:15.680
Ambassador Richards,

20:15.682 --> 20:17.448
welcome to Scottish court.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.783
Queen Mary.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.850
On behalf of Elizabeth,

20:19.852 --> 20:21.652
we've come for Lord Darnley.

20:21.654 --> 20:26.591
This time our visit isn't quite
as diplomatic in nature.

20:26.593 --> 20:28.993
Unfortunately, Lord Darnley
is not here tonight.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.363
Do you know where he might be?

20:32.365 --> 20:33.698
I don't.

20:33.700 --> 20:35.700
Seems like you've wasted a trip.

20:35.702 --> 20:39.303
Well, perhaps we'll
stay a little while,

20:39.305 --> 20:41.239
see if Lord Darnley turns up.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.940
You don't mind.
Of course not.

20:42.942 --> 20:45.476
You and your men are my guests,
please,

20:45.478 --> 20:47.745
enjoy yourselves.

20:47.747 --> 20:50.715
♪ ♪

20:52.619 --> 20:55.620
Send out your scouts
to every surrounding region

20:55.622 --> 20:56.687
to search for
more English troops.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.322
If Richards really did
only bring

20:58.324 --> 21:01.559
15 men, then there's
another plan afoot here.

21:04.631 --> 21:05.830
CLAUDE:
<i> This feels rather awkward.</i>

21:05.832 --> 21:06.831
Drink?

21:06.833 --> 21:08.833
God, yes.
(chuckles)

21:11.704 --> 21:13.004
(chuckles)

21:13.006 --> 21:14.005
(Claude laughing)

21:14.007 --> 21:15.873
(Luc laughing)

21:15.875 --> 21:18.009
Oh, you have a little bit
on your chin there.

21:35.061 --> 21:36.060
Ah.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.462
(Claude giggling)

21:40.667 --> 21:42.733
(gasping)

21:47.974 --> 21:51.075
I'm sorry, I can't.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.844
It's all right,
it's all right.

21:53.846 --> 21:55.346
But we did agree...
I know.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.882
I-I know what we agreed to.

21:59.352 --> 22:01.419
I just can't do this tonight.

22:01.421 --> 22:02.987
I understand.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.388
Another time.

22:04.390 --> 22:05.890
It's all right.

22:10.763 --> 22:12.697
(door opens)

22:14.801 --> 22:17.068
(festive music playing)

22:17.070 --> 22:19.704
(laughter)

22:19.706 --> 22:20.971
Our scouts have confirmed

22:20.973 --> 22:22.807
there are no more
English forces nearby.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.375
That doesn't make any sense.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.510
15 men isn't enough
for an attack.

22:26.512 --> 22:29.080
Perhaps Elizabeth was bluffing.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.948
Beg your pardon, Queen Mary,
but this message

22:30.950 --> 22:32.883
was left for you
at the gates.

22:34.654 --> 22:35.820
The Loyal Watchman.

22:35.822 --> 22:36.821
Did you see who delivered this?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.356
No, Your Majesty.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.796
He says an English assassin
was dispatched

22:45.798 --> 22:46.831
to Edinburgh days ago.

22:46.833 --> 22:48.799
Who's the target?
Unknown.

22:48.801 --> 22:50.101
You believe this "Watchman"
is credible?

22:50.103 --> 22:51.936
He's been right before.

22:51.937 --> 22:53.770
If the assassin left days ago,
he could be here

22:53.773 --> 22:55.373
right now, among
these soldiers,

22:55.375 --> 22:56.707
targeting you.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.509
No, Elizabeth wouldn't
have me assassinated

22:58.511 --> 22:59.944
in a crowded room, with her...

22:59.946 --> 23:01.879
soldiers in plain sight.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.881
No, she'd want her target
isolated.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.383
What is it?
England warned us

23:05.385 --> 23:06.884
that they were sending troops.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.053
That's why we moved Darnley--
to avoid a standoff.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.054
What if that was their plan

23:10.056 --> 23:11.389
all along?
They knew

23:11.391 --> 23:12.456
we'd divert
our forces here.

23:12.458 --> 23:13.858
They're going after Darnley.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.960
We need to send reinforcements
to the safe house.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.461
Now!

23:21.134 --> 23:23.401
DARNLEY:
<i> I'm losing my bloody mind.</i>

23:23.403 --> 23:24.969
How much longer do I have to be
stuck in this house?

23:24.971 --> 23:26.937
Queen Mary will send an escort
for you

23:26.939 --> 23:28.439
once it's safe to return.
Well,

23:28.441 --> 23:30.241
I've run dry.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.042
So go and fetch me some
ale from the cellar.

23:37.650 --> 23:38.916
(muffled yelling)

23:44.957 --> 23:46.424
(knocking)
MAN: Lord Darnley,
are you there?

23:46.426 --> 23:47.792
Queen Mary sent me.

23:47.794 --> 23:48.993
You are to return to
the castle at once.

23:48.995 --> 23:51.429
Come in.

23:51.431 --> 23:53.431
The English are gone.
It's safe to travel.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.698
Brilliant.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.833
(unsheathes sword)

23:55.835 --> 23:57.735
(grunting)

24:12.685 --> 24:14.118
(yelling)

24:20.793 --> 24:22.660
(yelling)

24:24.030 --> 24:25.930
(straining)

24:27.767 --> 24:29.834
Aah!

24:31.804 --> 24:32.603
(gasping)

24:34.207 --> 24:35.706
(grunting)

24:35.708 --> 24:37.641
(panting)

24:42.648 --> 24:46.217
I had no idea that, uh,

24:46.219 --> 24:49.753
you were a patron of the arts,
Queen Leeza.

24:49.755 --> 24:51.989
In a way. These were...

24:51.991 --> 24:54.058
"recovered" from
Protestant homes

24:54.060 --> 24:55.759
that just so happened
to be abandoned

24:55.761 --> 24:58.729
or destroyed due to
unfortunate outbreaks

24:58.731 --> 25:00.231
of religious conflict.
Mm.

25:00.233 --> 25:04.835
Conflicts that coincidentally

25:04.837 --> 25:07.071
happened to occur along
the same routes

25:07.073 --> 25:08.105
that you traveled.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.740
Mm.
(chuckles)

25:09.742 --> 25:11.809
How marvelous.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.078
It's quite a feeling.
Hmm?

25:14.080 --> 25:16.547
Ripping something beautiful away
from one's enemies.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.883
I knew you would
appreciate my passion.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.885
Excuse me, Your Majesty,

25:20.887 --> 25:22.219
we just heard a report
that the king was seen

25:22.221 --> 25:23.287
wandering in Meaux.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.123
Meaux?

25:26.125 --> 25:27.691
I-I thought you said that

25:27.693 --> 25:29.827
the king was at a
monastery in Reims?
He is.

25:29.829 --> 25:31.595
Then what is happening in Meaux?

25:31.597 --> 25:33.898
We've had trouble
in the region before

25:33.900 --> 25:35.766
with, uh, impersonators--

25:35.768 --> 25:38.035
thieves collecting taxes
from gullible townsfolk--

25:38.037 --> 25:39.937
it's disgraceful, really.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.739
I'll send the kingsguard

25:41.741 --> 25:42.740
to investigate.

25:42.742 --> 25:43.741
Do you want my men to help?

25:43.743 --> 25:45.843
No, your men belong with you.

25:45.845 --> 25:48.178
Mm.
This will take
just a moment

25:48.180 --> 25:49.713
to delegate.

25:49.715 --> 25:52.049
And when I come back,

25:52.051 --> 25:53.183
I want you to tell me
all about

25:53.185 --> 25:55.219
this piece here.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.588
(whispers):
Simply breathtaking.

25:59.325 --> 26:03.193
I want to know every gory detail

26:03.195 --> 26:05.296
of its recovery.
Mm.

26:05.298 --> 26:08.032
It's a dark tale.

26:08.968 --> 26:10.134
NARCISSE:
Claude.

26:10.136 --> 26:11.869
I need to speak to Luc,
where is he?

26:11.871 --> 26:14.238
What's going on?
It's about your brother.

26:15.708 --> 26:16.941
Leith!

26:18.244 --> 26:20.778
I need you.
Are you well enough to ride?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.313
I'm fine.

26:22.315 --> 26:24.281
Why aren't you with Luc?
He's gone.

26:24.283 --> 26:27.284
Narcisse sent him
to retrieve Charles.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.686
The king's been
spotted in Meaux.

26:28.688 --> 26:29.887
We have to bring
him back.

26:29.889 --> 26:30.955
Why are you telling me this?

26:30.957 --> 26:33.290
Charles is in a fragile state.

26:33.292 --> 26:35.125
Luc's practically a
stranger. You're not.

26:35.127 --> 26:36.327
He'll listen to you.

26:39.332 --> 26:40.998
What is it?

26:40.999 --> 26:42.665
If you're upset
about Luc and me,

26:42.668 --> 26:43.968
nothing happened tonight.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.336
Nothing?

26:45.338 --> 26:46.337
Really?

26:46.339 --> 26:48.639
Leith!

26:48.641 --> 26:49.974
Please, can we talk
about this later?

26:49.976 --> 26:52.343
If you leave now

26:52.345 --> 26:54.912
and follow Luc's trail,
you can reach Charles tonight.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.313
Please.

26:56.315 --> 26:58.282
My brother is in trouble.

26:58.284 --> 27:00.351
Will you help him?

27:05.391 --> 27:07.024
Darnley?

27:07.026 --> 27:08.509
Mary.

27:08.510 --> 27:09.993
(crying): I'm so sorry
I sent you here.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.261
Are you all right?
The assassin?

27:11.263 --> 27:12.896
He killed my guard,
tried to kill me.

27:12.898 --> 27:14.131
You almost died
because of me.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.799
DARNLEY:
You don't need to be upset.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.068
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm getting married soon.

27:19.639 --> 27:21.772
(sniffles)

27:21.774 --> 27:24.174
England orchestrated this.

27:24.176 --> 27:25.909
I want everyone to know.

27:31.150 --> 27:32.282
(horse snorts)

27:33.252 --> 27:35.085
Who's there?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.354
Hyah! Hyah!
(horse neighs)

27:37.356 --> 27:41.158
(horse snorts)

27:42.094 --> 27:46.363
(man groaning, panting)

27:46.365 --> 27:47.331
My God, are you
all right?

27:47.333 --> 27:49.166
(panting)

27:50.336 --> 27:51.335
Leith?

27:52.304 --> 27:54.171
What happened?

27:54.173 --> 27:55.306
Bandits.

27:55.307 --> 27:56.440
They stabbed me
and they took my horse.

27:56.442 --> 27:59.043
Well, they're gone now.

27:59.045 --> 28:00.944
(groans)

28:00.946 --> 28:02.646
Did you follow me?

28:02.647 --> 28:04.347
Claude sent me. She wanted me
to help bring Charles back.

28:04.350 --> 28:05.416
(grunts)

28:05.418 --> 28:07.017
Your leg, it's...

28:07.019 --> 28:08.052
(inhaling sharply):
It's fine.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.737
I just need to keep
pressure on it.

28:09.738 --> 28:11.421
You need more than that.
You're bleeding out.

28:11.424 --> 28:14.058
(groaning, panting)

28:14.060 --> 28:15.192
What is it?

28:15.194 --> 28:16.794
I'm grateful you're here,
it's just...

28:17.863 --> 28:19.363
...of all the people
to come and help me.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.698
Yes.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.700
The man you replaced.

28:22.702 --> 28:25.102
I never pursued Claude.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.438
Yeah, I know, it
was all arranged.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.206
It's more than that now,
isn't it?

28:32.378 --> 28:35.779
Leith, nothing happened
between Claude and I.

28:35.781 --> 28:38.282
She called it off.

28:38.284 --> 28:40.484
Well, I'm not sure that matters.

28:41.454 --> 28:44.455
Something will happen...

28:44.457 --> 28:46.757
as long as she's married to you.

28:46.759 --> 28:50.260
Leith-- Leith,

28:50.262 --> 28:53.163
I-I need a tourniquet
to stop the bleeding.

28:54.133 --> 28:55.132
Leith.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.301
You can't let me die out here.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.737
Actually, I can.

29:10.816 --> 29:11.849
Your Majesty, you sent for me?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.784
When we last spoke, you said

29:13.786 --> 29:15.319
you had a skin condition
that affected

29:15.321 --> 29:16.887
your fingers?
Yes, Your Majesty.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.956
It struck me:

29:18.957 --> 29:21.024
there is a solvent
my ladies use to erase blemishes

29:21.026 --> 29:23.360
from their skin-- it
has a similar effect,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.229
and I wondered...

29:25.231 --> 29:26.997
is there something
you were desperately

29:26.999 --> 29:29.199

from your own hands?

29:29.201 --> 29:31.502

open your chest.

29:31.504 --> 29:34.438
And I found this.

29:39.011 --> 29:42.513
You have been dyeing
common flowers blue.

29:42.515 --> 29:43.881
(distant bell ringing)

29:43.883 --> 29:45.983

exorbitant amount

29:45.985 --> 29:49.086

29:49.088 --> 29:51.054
Queen Elizabeth, please,
let me explain. I'm not...

been giving Agatha?

29:52.825 --> 29:54.925

29:54.927 --> 29:56.794
I...

29:56.796 --> 29:58.061
gave Agatha an opiate,

29:58.063 --> 29:59.263
to relieve her pain
and help her sleep.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.898
Then how did her fever break?

30:00.900 --> 30:03.267
I had her bathed in ice,
from your cellar.

30:03.269 --> 30:05.936
So you have been
manipulating her symptoms.

30:05.938 --> 30:07.905
What else can I do
in this kind of case?

30:07.907 --> 30:10.874
I did my best
to relieve her pain,

30:10.876 --> 30:13.944
but the cure you're looking for
doesn't exist.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.479
Then she will die?

30:15.481 --> 30:16.847
I can make her comfortable.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.882
But she will die?

30:18.884 --> 30:20.184
Yes.

30:20.186 --> 30:24.354
You defrauded a queen!

30:24.356 --> 30:25.889

30:40.005 --> 30:42.940
Kozlov's reputation was
of the highest order.

30:42.942 --> 30:45.442

doubt his methods until now.

30:45.444 --> 30:46.944

30:46.946 --> 30:49.880

tell Gideon the truth.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.562
her symptoms returned.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.797
Send the court physician
to Agatha's bedside at once.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.032
The court physician

39:29.034 --> 39:31.134
can't help her.
Where is Kozlov?

39:31.136 --> 39:33.470
Gideon.

39:33.472 --> 39:35.538
Sit with me a moment.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.408
Please?

39:38.410 --> 39:40.477
♪ ♪

39:47.853 --> 39:51.388
Let's go spend
the night together.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.489
(moans)

39:52.491 --> 39:54.657
No, we can't.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.159
We're not married yet.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.660
Well, that didn't
stop you last night.

39:57.662 --> 39:59.662
Or this morning.

39:59.664 --> 40:01.898
Very well.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.401
(exhales)
Good night,

40:04.403 --> 40:05.769
Queen Mary.

40:05.771 --> 40:07.137
Good night,

40:07.139 --> 40:09.639
King Darnley.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.911
KEIRA:
You don't love her.

40:18.116 --> 40:19.749
Keira.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.522
What are you doing here? You...

40:25.524 --> 40:26.856
You're married.
You shouldn't be here.

40:26.858 --> 40:27.957
I couldn't stay away.

40:27.959 --> 40:30.093
Oh, I ca-- I can't...

40:30.095 --> 40:31.795
breathe in that house.

40:31.797 --> 40:33.463
Lying next
to him,

40:33.465 --> 40:35.465
thinking only of you
every night.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.100
Oh, don't you ever think of me?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.702
I-I thought I'd never
see you again.

40:39.704 --> 40:42.739
But you are the love of my life,

40:42.741 --> 40:44.707
and I am yours.

40:45.710 --> 40:47.777
Keira. I'm going to marry

40:47.779 --> 40:49.112
the queen of Scotland.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.181
You can't.

40:51.183 --> 40:54.951
She'll never win
your heart, Darnley.

40:56.655 --> 40:59.556
It's mine.
