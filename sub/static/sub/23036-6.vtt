00:07.707 --> 00:08.708
[The Beast growls]

00:10.777 --> 00:12.612
[Clément] My background is in parkour.

00:13.880 --> 00:15.949
It's not just about jumping over walls.

00:16.449 --> 00:18.852
It's also about getting back
your freedom.

00:19.586 --> 00:22.489
That basic freedom, the freedom to move.

00:25.792 --> 00:28.495
Conquering the obstacles
of Ultimate Beastmaster...

00:32.265 --> 00:35.402
Inspiring the nation,
or even just inspiring yourself...

00:36.369 --> 00:38.204
in order to achieve your objectives.

00:42.008 --> 00:43.276
[theme music playing]

00:50.550 --> 00:51.885
[cheering]

00:54.854 --> 00:57.824
[Tiki] Is it me
or is the Beast getting bigger?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.692
Somebody has to stop feeding that thing.

00:59.759 --> 01:01.795
[Chris] It's been eating athletes
like popcorn.

01:01.861 --> 01:04.831
But have you seen them?
Honestly, talk about lean protein!

01:04.897 --> 01:07.667
They have zero fat.
It's like eating a chicken foot.

01:07.734 --> 01:08.601
[Tiki laughs]

01:08.668 --> 01:12.038
Hello, everyone. I'm Tiki Barber
and with me is Chris Distefano.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.775
Tonight, we've got 12 new competitors,

01:15.842 --> 01:20.246
waiting to attack
the world's toughest obstacle course.

01:20.313 --> 01:24.984
But only one will win $10,000
and become tonight's Beastmaster.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.354
We already have
five Beastmasters in place,

01:28.421 --> 01:31.858
four spots remaining,
and tonight we will crown number six.

01:33.660 --> 01:36.596
[Chris] Earlier tonight, we got to meet
our two American competitors,

01:36.663 --> 01:39.132
and I think it's safe to say,
we're sitting pretty.

01:39.632 --> 01:40.767
You're a powerlifter.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.869
Yeah, powerlifter, weightlifting...

01:42.936 --> 01:45.138
Do you think you can handle
twice your weight?

01:45.205 --> 01:46.039
Easy.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.441
-I won't hurt you, right?
-You won't hurt me.

01:51.911 --> 01:53.046
-Nice.
-[Chris] Here we go.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.114
[Tiki] That's one rep.

01:55.048 --> 01:56.416
-[Chris] One and two.
-Two reps.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.419
Alright, I've got to save some
for the jumps on the Beast.

01:59.486 --> 02:01.154
-[Chris] Impressive.
-[Myra] Awesome.

02:01.221 --> 02:02.088
Thank you.

02:02.322 --> 02:04.457
[Tiki] Myra began powerlifting
after childbirth,

02:04.524 --> 02:06.960
and it turned her
into one tough mother.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.764
Powerlifting gives me an edge in
this competition, in speed and strength.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.267
I will be the Ultimate Beastmaster.

02:14.634 --> 02:16.302
-You're an MMA fighter, yes?
-Yes.

02:16.369 --> 02:19.939
I've been next to the other competitors.
With him, I'll keep my distance.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.575
Because I just feel like
I don't want to say something

02:22.642 --> 02:24.477
and just get my head snapped back.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.479
I've got to be in fight mode and be ready.

02:27.013 --> 02:30.416
[Tiki] Andres plans to use his MMA skills
to KO the Beast.

02:31.117 --> 02:34.187
[Andres] I'm not afraid of challenges.
I'm aggressive in the cage.

02:34.254 --> 02:37.157
And I try to be aggressive
in anything else I do.

02:37.223 --> 02:39.325
I'm the Ultimate Beastmaster. Believe it.

02:39.959 --> 02:42.829
[Chris] Don't get a face tattoo.
That's one thing you shouldn't do.

02:42.896 --> 02:44.564
-I won't.
-[Chris] USA, baby!

02:44.631 --> 02:45.565
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

02:45.632 --> 02:47.433
-[Andres] USA!
-[Myra] USA!

02:47.767 --> 02:48.935
[Chris] Crush it, alright?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.870
[Tiki] Let's kick it off!

02:50.937 --> 02:53.306
Level 1 starts right now.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.142
It's time for our first athlete.

02:56.209 --> 02:59.879
From China, parkour coach, Minghua He.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.815
-You know what the people here call him?
-What?

03:02.882 --> 03:03.917
-Andy.
-Andy?

03:03.983 --> 03:06.653
-From Toy Story.
-How do you get "Andy" from Minghua He?

03:06.719 --> 03:07.720
[Tiki] Andy!

03:11.991 --> 03:16.062
I like parkour because I feel

03:16.496 --> 03:21.701
it makes me think of ways
to overcome obstacles.

03:21.768 --> 03:24.904
When I was young, my parents got divorced.

03:24.971 --> 03:28.841
It's only when I train for parkour
that I'm able to forget about my troubles.

03:29.742 --> 03:31.945
My relationship
with my grandmother is great

03:32.011 --> 03:34.147
because she was the one who brought me up.

03:34.514 --> 03:41.087
She's afraid I might hurt myself.
If I win, I'll treat her to a meal.

03:41.487 --> 03:47.894
She'll be really happy
because she's always talking about me.

03:52.365 --> 03:53.233
[man] You can do it!

03:54.234 --> 03:55.702
I LOVE CHINA! CHINA WILL WIN!

03:58.638 --> 03:59.906
[Tiki] Here we go, Andy.

04:05.478 --> 04:06.646
He's on the Grinder.

04:09.716 --> 04:11.851
-He's got to jump out, not up.
-[Chris] Yes.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.755
-Come on, Team China!
-You can do it!

04:16.422 --> 04:18.757
He jumped the second Grinder so easily.

04:19.192 --> 04:23.796
[Chris] Minghua He deceptively
is already on the third Grinder.

04:23.863 --> 04:24.864
[Tiki] Quick jump.

04:26.666 --> 04:29.469
Now, here he is on the Faceplant.
This is the hard one, man.

04:29.535 --> 04:30.536
This guy is jacked.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.873
You've got to hold on to the side
and lean forward.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.577
-Look at the concentration on his face.
-[Chris] No, this kid is good.

04:39.612 --> 04:43.249
-There's Andy--
-[Tiki] He's going for the Energy Coil.

04:44.250 --> 04:47.186
[Chris] Wow, Andy got...
He got the Energy Coil. He looks like...

04:47.253 --> 04:50.923
You know why I like the Chinese outfits?
They look like mustard and ketchup.

04:50.990 --> 04:53.493
[Tiki] Not even thinking about
the Thruster opportunity.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.529
-Andy jumps out. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Yeah! Yes!

04:56.596 --> 04:58.331
He grabbed it so firmly.

04:58.398 --> 05:00.867
-[Tiki] That's a long jump.
-[Chris] That's ten feet.

05:00.933 --> 05:02.969
-[Tiki] That is ten feet.
-[Chris] He's got hops.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.103
Andy!

05:04.570 --> 05:06.339
Oh, Andy! He's hanging on.

05:06.406 --> 05:08.241
[Tiki] Did you see that?
That was one landing!

05:08.308 --> 05:09.642
[Chris] He's got grip strength.

05:09.709 --> 05:10.910
Yeah!

05:10.977 --> 05:11.878
Go, Minghua!

05:12.545 --> 05:15.815
[Tiki] Alright, now he's on to the
Deadbolts. Now, these Deadbolts move.

05:15.882 --> 05:16.716
[Chris] Yeah.

05:17.250 --> 05:20.186
[Tiki] There's some strategy here.
It's not just strong hands.

05:20.253 --> 05:21.421
It takes some strategy.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.724
This is all about momentum,
transfer of weight, back and forth.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.292
Confidently.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.329
[Chris] You have to get... It's a lot
of ab strength and core strength.

05:29.395 --> 05:32.498
-[Tiki] He's stuck. He has to figure out--
-[Chris] He wants to use his feet.

05:32.565 --> 05:35.735
[Tiki] He has to use his feet
because if you stand there too long,

05:35.802 --> 05:37.070
your hands will get tired.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.172
[Chris] Yeah,
and then you'll lose all momentum.

05:39.238 --> 05:41.541
[Tiki] And you can't move forward
with the Deadbolt.

05:41.607 --> 05:43.242
-You have to hold--
-There you go.

05:43.309 --> 05:44.711
[cheering]

05:44.777 --> 05:46.512
Cool, cool, cool.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.315
[Tiki] It's one thing to be strong
and have muscles,

05:49.382 --> 05:51.351
but to hold on to something takes talent.

05:51.417 --> 05:52.919
[Chris] That is hard - to hold on.

05:52.985 --> 05:55.021
Ask every relationship I've been in.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.456
Get to the next Deadbolt!

05:56.522 --> 05:58.358
[Tiki] Let's hope
the Beast doesn't eat him.

05:58.424 --> 05:59.859
[Chris] Oh, Andy!

06:00.827 --> 06:03.529
-Into the belly!
-Into the Beast!

06:04.263 --> 06:05.431
[Chris sighs]

06:06.132 --> 06:07.967
[Tiki] As you can see in this replay,

06:08.034 --> 06:10.803
he's trying to use one hand
to grab the Deadbolt.

06:10.870 --> 06:14.240
Most of the competitors who are successful
use the momentum to jump

06:14.307 --> 06:15.942
and grab with both hands.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.145
What a way to kick off the night
and get to the Deadbolts.

06:19.212 --> 06:20.079
[Chris] Absolutely.

06:20.580 --> 06:21.647
He ain't no Deadbolt.

06:21.714 --> 06:25.551
I couldn't make it across
because I wasted a lot of energy.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.254
I hope that my teammate will succeed.

06:28.321 --> 06:29.422
Good luck.

06:29.856 --> 06:33.459
-[Chris] Andy's got 65 points.
-[Tiki] He started off the night nicely.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.362
Let's see if that holds up
and gets him into Level 2.

06:36.796 --> 06:41.768
[Chris] Next up, she's the number one
wrestler in Italy, Francesca Indelicato.

06:41.834 --> 06:43.836
-That was impressive.
-Thank you.

06:44.137 --> 06:47.273
[Chris] Francesca's a self-proclaimed
tomboy and wrestling champion.

06:47.340 --> 06:49.008
And she wants to be in the Olympics.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.979
But first, she's representing
her country on the Beast, so relax.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.915
Blood! Blood!

06:55.982 --> 06:57.683
Blood! Blood!

06:59.185 --> 07:01.287
Francesca, go, go, go!

07:01.354 --> 07:03.322
-Ouch! I hurt myself!
-Oh, no!

07:04.056 --> 07:05.124
Go, go!

07:05.191 --> 07:06.192
Thank you.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.095
[audience cheering]

07:10.163 --> 07:13.132
[Tiki] Now, she's a smaller female
so she's five-four.

07:13.199 --> 07:15.735
-This is a 7.5-foot jump.
-[Chris] OK.

07:15.802 --> 07:19.138
[Tiki] The average elite woman
can only jump about 6 foot 6",

07:19.205 --> 07:20.373
so see if she can make it.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.675
-Come on, Francesca!
-And one, and...

07:22.742 --> 07:23.743
Go on...

07:24.644 --> 07:26.345
[commentators groan]

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
It's a very sad moment.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.350
I'd appreciate a little silence.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.452
Silence, silence...

07:34.387 --> 07:37.523
-[Chris] She did the best she could.
-[Tiki] She did. Five points for her.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.793
[Chris] You have to hit it right
because if you hit it in the middle...

07:40.860 --> 07:42.895
She had the distance
but hit the soft spot.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.863
She bounced back.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.632
You know what it is?
I remember being a kid.

07:46.699 --> 07:49.068
I would run and jump
and give my dad a bear hug.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.070
But he had one of those big pot bellies.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.773
I bounced right off him
and hit the ottoman.

07:53.840 --> 07:57.276
I broke another lamp
because my dad wanted to have a sandwich.

07:57.910 --> 08:02.582
[Tiki] Next up from France which, if you
didn't know, is the birthplace of parkour.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.517
We've got a parkour athlete for you...

08:04.884 --> 08:06.319
Clément Dumais.

08:06.619 --> 08:09.322
-Oh, parkour was born in France?
-It was indeed.

08:09.388 --> 08:10.957
It's pronounced "par-kou".

08:11.023 --> 08:12.091
[Tiki laughs]

08:15.695 --> 08:18.731
[Clément] Parkour is a bit like a game
where you try to deviate

08:18.798 --> 08:21.267
from the more traditional ways
of using things.

08:23.436 --> 08:28.841
One November evening in 2015,
we had this project going on,

08:28.908 --> 08:31.244
which was to scale the Eiffel Tower.

08:33.679 --> 08:37.482
No harness, just our hands, our arms
and everything that goes with them.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.318
It took us a year to prepare for.

08:39.385 --> 08:42.221
When the police asked
how we got up there,

08:42.288 --> 08:45.124
we told them we'd climbed up,
and they didn't believe us.

08:45.558 --> 08:48.261
We weren't on CCTV,
because we'd avoided those angles,

08:48.327 --> 08:50.129
and so they really didn't believe us.

08:50.196 --> 08:52.231
"Yes, we did." "No you didn't."

08:55.368 --> 08:58.437
I spent my best night in Paris,
in the arms of the Iron Lady.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.877
Come on, let's bring out the flag,
because I believe in Clément!

09:04.944 --> 09:08.848
[Chris] Clément actually teaches
at-risk youth parkour

09:08.915 --> 09:12.084
to keep them away from drugs
and to keep them away from the police.

09:12.151 --> 09:14.620
That's so nobody can catch
a parkouring criminal.

09:17.189 --> 09:19.692
[Tiki] He's going for the Thruster.
He barely made it, too.

09:20.459 --> 09:23.195
This is the one we always see
athletes have trouble with.

09:23.529 --> 09:24.597
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

09:24.664 --> 09:26.365
[Chris] Clément grabbed it.

09:26.866 --> 09:29.402
-[Tiki] He face-planted.
-[Chris] He got it with his armpit.

09:29.468 --> 09:31.637
You have to use every inch
of your body.

09:31.704 --> 09:35.007
If you have a strand of hair
that can get onto that Energy Coil,

09:35.074 --> 09:36.042
you'd better use it.

09:36.108 --> 09:37.310
[Tiki] He has hair. Look.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.512
[Chris] He's got
a nice comb-over, for sure.

09:42.815 --> 09:43.683
Bravo!

09:46.886 --> 09:48.321
[Tiki] He's on to the Deadbolts.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.326
He got another Thruster.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.463
Let's see if he learned a lesson
from Andy's run

09:57.530 --> 09:59.532
about two-handing that third Deadbolt.

10:02.501 --> 10:05.204
He's going to kill me!
I nearly had a heart attack!

10:05.271 --> 10:08.608
My heart might stop, Clément.
Don't slip up, darling!

10:08.674 --> 10:10.076
[Tiki] There you go.

10:10.142 --> 10:12.445
[Chris] Now, these mags
can fall at any second.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.214
You don't know which one will fall
or when it will fall.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.816
[Sandy and Gilles] Come on, Clément!

10:16.882 --> 10:19.685
[Tiki] He's racking up points
every time he goes by the orange lines.

10:19.752 --> 10:21.320
He just hit another Thruster.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.956
He is "Beasting" this thing.

10:24.523 --> 10:28.527
-We're so good at this!
-Come on, Clément!

10:28.594 --> 10:31.764
-Keep your balance!
-Balance, Clément!

10:31.831 --> 10:32.798
[Tiki] Can he do it?

10:33.766 --> 10:34.967
[Chris] Clément!

10:35.801 --> 10:38.604
[Tiki] So close! So close for Clément.

10:39.438 --> 10:41.774
[Clément] I thought I'd make it,
not end up in the water.

10:42.074 --> 10:44.276
But it's OK. I was one obstacle short.

10:45.011 --> 10:45.945
Almost perfect.

10:46.145 --> 10:50.082
[Tiki] Clément Dumais, into first place.
115 points.

10:50.149 --> 10:51.884
-Yeah!
-Looking good.

10:51.951 --> 10:53.185
We like it.

10:53.252 --> 10:56.355
He climbed the Eiffel Tower.
But he couldn't tame the Beast.

10:56.422 --> 10:57.523
[Tiki] It's official.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.960
The Beast is more intense
than the Eiffel Tower.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.867
[Tiki] Now, let's take a look
at highlights of four more athletes

11:07.933 --> 11:10.169
hoping to power their way through Level 1.

11:10.870 --> 11:13.639
[Chris] From the USA, Andres Encinales.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.441
[Tiki] Andres is an MMA wrestler.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.209
So he's got some intensity.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.046
Come on, Andres! Pull yourself up.

11:20.112 --> 11:21.881
[Tiki] After a close call on Faceplant...

11:21.947 --> 11:23.416
[Chris] There we go. He made it.

11:23.482 --> 11:26.652
[Tiki] ...the naval officer and MMA star
showed some serious fight.

11:26.719 --> 11:28.554
-Can he hold on?
-[Chris] Come on!

11:30.222 --> 11:33.893
[Tiki] Aude Brignone of France
is like a Swiss Army knife of athletes.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.561
Nine years - ballet dancer.

11:35.628 --> 11:39.699
[Chris] Also, five years - horseback
riding, two years - pole dancing, boxing--

11:39.765 --> 11:41.167
Hold up. Two years, what?

11:42.201 --> 11:43.536
[commentators groan]

11:43.736 --> 11:47.206
[Tiki] And Aude's first jump on the
Grinder was a dance with the devil.

11:47.273 --> 11:50.209
Marc Vela hopes to propel himself
to the top of the pack

11:50.276 --> 11:51.877
with his pole vaulting prowess.

11:51.944 --> 11:56.015
He's a pole vaulter so being
in compromising positions in the air

11:56.082 --> 11:57.650
is something he's used to.

11:57.983 --> 11:59.618
He'll make it. It's the last one.

11:59.685 --> 12:01.987
-[Tiki] Can he do it?
-[Chris] No!

12:02.054 --> 12:03.189
No!

12:03.756 --> 12:07.560
[Chris] Giles D'Souza.
And he trains the Special Forces of India.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.628
So this guy's a true badass.

12:09.695 --> 12:13.132
NSG commandos have a lot of urban
warfare training that they need to do,

12:13.199 --> 12:15.534
but we developed
a parkour course with them.

12:15.968 --> 12:18.904
They need to learn how
to infiltrate buildings quietly.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.773
-Giles!
-Giles!

12:20.840 --> 12:23.309
[Tiki] Now, he's deploying
his stealth-like moves

12:23.375 --> 12:24.777
to infiltrate the Beast.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.912
With this next move,
he could take the lead.

12:26.979 --> 12:27.813
Oh, my God.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.282
Sarah, if he gets this,
can I go on a date with you?

12:32.218 --> 12:34.453
-[Sarah-Jane] No!
-[Vidyut] No!

12:34.520 --> 12:36.922
-[Sarah-Jane] You were bad karma.
-Is that a no on the date?

12:36.989 --> 12:38.657
-[Sarah-Jane] It might be.
-It's a no?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.860
My dad's cursing at the TV:

12:40.926 --> 12:42.428
"Kid blew it again!"

12:43.295 --> 12:44.263
[the Beast growls]

12:44.330 --> 12:47.166
[Chris] Next up, from the
USA, stay-at-home mom and powerlifter,

12:47.233 --> 12:49.301
Myra Robinson, everybody.

12:52.238 --> 12:53.272
[girl] One, two...

12:53.339 --> 12:54.774
[Myra] I'm a mom to three kids.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.877
My husband and I are licensed
therapeutic foster parents,

12:57.943 --> 13:00.880
which means we take in kids
who are removed from their home

13:00.946 --> 13:03.649
because of cases of neglect or abuse.

13:03.716 --> 13:06.352
We're looking to model. Hey!

13:06.652 --> 13:07.953
Hey!

13:08.320 --> 13:10.790
Foster care is something
I had always wanted to do,

13:10.856 --> 13:12.191
as my mom was a foster parent.

13:12.258 --> 13:15.027
And my parents taught me, growing up,

13:15.094 --> 13:17.596
that if there's someone out there
who's suffering,

13:17.663 --> 13:21.167
it's not their problem, it's everyone's,
and we have to help each other.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.435
Nobody inspires me more than foster kids.

13:23.502 --> 13:25.237
-Do you love me?
-Yeah.

13:25.304 --> 13:27.473
And it makes me emotional
thinking about...

13:27.973 --> 13:29.475
all that they've been through.

13:29.542 --> 13:34.680
Any time I think of obstacles in life,
I think about what they've been through,

13:34.747 --> 13:37.082
and I think, I can do this!

13:37.149 --> 13:38.984
If they can do it, I can do it.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.891
[Tiki] Confidently through Bite Force.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.092
There you go!

13:47.259 --> 13:49.261
[Chris] She's a rock-climber
and powerlifter,

13:49.328 --> 13:51.697
so I think the upper-body strength
is no problem.

13:51.764 --> 13:55.467
But again, the issue we've been having
with most of the female competitors

13:55.534 --> 13:58.971
is this distance
between these two Grinders.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.574
[man] Take your time. Take your time.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.944
[Chris] Oh, and she held on.
Good for you, Myra.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.279
[Tiki] She's smart. She went hands first.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.382
As opposed to trying to
get her feet on it, she went hands first,

14:10.449 --> 14:12.818
and grabbed the edge of the Grinder.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.620
[Chris] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:15.154 --> 14:16.989
[Tiki] She just couldn't save it.

14:17.489 --> 14:19.859
-[Tiki] Is she OK?
-[Chris] She's hurt, emotionally.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.095
She really wanted that bad
for her country, for her family.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.930
You can see the disappointment.

14:24.997 --> 14:28.667
I landed and I just couldn't...
My hands just weren't sticking.

14:29.635 --> 14:32.371
I felt I had the distance,
but my hands weren't sticking.

14:32.671 --> 14:33.806
[Chris] But you know what?

14:34.006 --> 14:35.207
She did a great effort.

14:35.274 --> 14:36.909
She's sitting at 15 points.

14:38.244 --> 14:41.380
[Tiki] With Clément Dumais
setting fire to his competition,

14:41.447 --> 14:44.917
our next two competitors
hope to extinguish those flames.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.486
And this Spaniard
was the perfect guy to do it.

14:47.553 --> 14:50.923
[Chris] Samuel Muñoz,
a firefighter from Spain.

14:50.990 --> 14:52.524
[Tiki] When we run out, he runs in.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.026
Can he make it?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.396
Spain! Spain!

14:57.863 --> 14:59.698
[commentators] No!

14:59.765 --> 15:00.633
LONG LIVE SPAIN!

15:01.233 --> 15:03.402
[Chris] Pietro Lalla from Italy.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.704
[Tiki] Now, Pietro's the oldest
of the competitors.

15:05.771 --> 15:08.407
-Forty-three years old.
-[Chris] Wow.

15:08.908 --> 15:10.676
He's in shape. He has good footwork.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.445
I think he has what it takes
to tame this Beast right now.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.247
[Tiki] Can he make it?

15:15.581 --> 15:17.449
[commentators groan]

15:17.516 --> 15:19.385
And that is not going to do it.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.120
All that build-up for that?

15:21.186 --> 15:22.421
[Chris] The Beast will slay you, man.

15:22.488 --> 15:25.324
[Tiki] And with that, let's see
how the leaderboard is shaping up.

15:25.724 --> 15:28.260
Francesca Indelicato and French star,

15:28.327 --> 15:31.063
Aude Brignone, bid adieu to the Beast,

15:31.130 --> 15:33.899
putting the last Italian, Pietro Lalla,

15:33.966 --> 15:34.833
on the bubble.

15:34.900 --> 15:38.103
[Chris] And remember, only the top eight
will advance to the next level.

15:38.170 --> 15:41.140
-Now, here's quite a career transition...
-OK.

15:41.206 --> 15:45.644
Former Chinese Naval Special
Operations, who now owns a diner.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.279
-Owns a diner?
-Owns a diner.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.581
Oh, my...
I love chicken fingers from a diner.

15:49.982 --> 15:51.517
[Tiki] Bin Xie!

15:54.720 --> 15:57.957
[Bin] It was my dream to join the military
and be in Special Operations.

15:59.458 --> 16:02.461
From 1860 candidates,
only 120 were selected.

16:02.728 --> 16:04.396
It was also based on a fitness test.

16:04.997 --> 16:10.135
After a year of training,
there were only 60 of us left.

16:11.203 --> 16:13.939
I'm the eldest in my family.

16:14.006 --> 16:19.011
My mom sells barbecued meat
back in Guangdong.

16:19.478 --> 16:24.883
My mom wasn't feeling well, so I quit
my job and went back home to help her.

16:24.950 --> 16:29.555
The reason why I'm joining
this American show, Ultimate Beastmaster,

16:29.822 --> 16:32.291
is actually for my family, my parents

16:32.791 --> 16:33.759
and my girlfriend.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.494
I hope they can have a better life.

16:39.932 --> 16:41.100
[crowd] Come on!

16:41.567 --> 16:44.036
[Chris] So Pietro from Italy
is now on the bubble.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.706
All Bin Xie has to do right now
is get more than ten points.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.744
[Tiki] Now, he's got a unique nickname.
They call him the "Monkey King."

16:51.810 --> 16:52.678
[Chris] Monkey King?

16:53.312 --> 16:54.847
[Tiki] Bin is very, very confident--

16:54.913 --> 16:56.849
[Chris] Now I know
why they call him that.

16:57.483 --> 16:59.051
[Tiki] Monkeys can jump. Can he jump?

16:59.118 --> 17:00.819
-[Chris] He can.
-[Tiki] Very easily.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.888
[Chris] Yes, he can. Through the Grinder.

17:02.955 --> 17:05.023
So Pietro from Italy is now out.

17:05.457 --> 17:09.494
China will win! China will win!

17:09.560 --> 17:12.698
[singing]

17:15.733 --> 17:16.902
Woohoo!

17:16.969 --> 17:20.239
[Chris] And his Chinese comrades
are cheering him on here.

17:20.305 --> 17:22.340
[Tiki] Let's hope we don't
get a face-plant here.

17:22.407 --> 17:23.876
[chanting]

17:23.942 --> 17:24.943
Come on!

17:25.411 --> 17:26.278
Come on!

17:27.012 --> 17:28.146
Yeah!

17:30.749 --> 17:33.652
-[Tiki] Off the Faceplant - Bin Xie.
-[Chris] That was monkey-like.

17:33.719 --> 17:34.953
[Tiki] Onto the Energy Coils.

17:35.020 --> 17:38.590
See if he can rack up some points here
and move up the leaderboard.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.159
[Tiki and Chris] Oh!

17:40.225 --> 17:43.629
[Tiki] Wow. So he's using his momentum.
Bin Xie.

17:43.695 --> 17:44.630
Come on!

17:44.696 --> 17:45.898
[Chris] Trust yourself.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.466
Is this going to be on?

17:47.666 --> 17:48.500
[Tiki] It's on!

17:48.567 --> 17:50.936
[Chris] The Monkey King
is more like a flying squirrel.

17:51.003 --> 17:52.738
It's on like Donkey Kong.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.673
It's on like Donkey Kong. OK.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.675
-The video game. OK--
-[Tiki] Wow!

17:57.009 --> 17:57.943
Look at that.

17:58.010 --> 18:02.114
Oh, nice nailing of the Point Thruster
with the foot. Nailed it!

18:02.181 --> 18:05.284
Woohoo! Woohoo!

18:05.350 --> 18:07.486
Monkey King! You're doing a good job!

18:09.822 --> 18:13.125
-[Chris] He's getting to the Mag Wall.
-[Tiki] The third to the fourth is a jump.

18:13.192 --> 18:14.827
-Let go!
-[Chris] He should have let go.

18:14.893 --> 18:16.462
-[Chris] Let it go!
-[Tiki] Nice.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.066
We're going to get our second competitor
of the evening get to the Mag Wall.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.769
-[Chris] Let's see.
-[Tiki] Bin Xie.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.106
[Chris] He makes it look easy.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.509
-These mags are going to fall off.
-[Tiki] Every two seconds, one falls off.

18:30.576 --> 18:36.215
-Go! Keep going!
-Go! Keep going!

18:36.281 --> 18:37.549
One more Point Thruster.

18:37.616 --> 18:40.219
[Tiki] He hit another Thruster.
Could he be the first one?

18:40.285 --> 18:41.854
[Chris] No one has done it yet tonight.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.524
Bin Xie, keep going!

18:46.058 --> 18:46.925
Bin Xie!

18:46.992 --> 18:47.826
[Tiki] Is there one?

18:48.760 --> 18:50.429
[Chris] The Monkey King is close.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.631
[commentators groan]

18:53.665 --> 18:57.302
[Tiki] There is not one, but you just
got baptized in the blood of the Beast.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.472
[cheering]

19:00.539 --> 19:01.940
[Qinyi] I need to run around!

19:04.243 --> 19:05.944
[Tiki] Here's the replay of Bin Xie.

19:06.545 --> 19:09.348
Barely hangs on to the Mag Wall.
Barely. But he gets it.

19:09.414 --> 19:12.151
Here's the important thing:
those things fall quickly.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.052
As soon as he gets his hand off it,

19:14.119 --> 19:15.721
it falls off behind him.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.591
This last jump is always so hard,
because how do you get your momentum?

19:19.658 --> 19:22.961
[Chris] You're holding on, holding on,
and then, boom! He falls down.

19:23.028 --> 19:25.597
-Well, he made his diner proud tonight.
-[Tiki] Yes, he did.

19:25.931 --> 19:29.401
[Chris] With that incredible run, the
Monkey King catapults to second place,

19:29.468 --> 19:32.671
eliminating Pietro and Team Italy
from tonight's competition.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.006
Arrivederci!

19:34.273 --> 19:35.307
Goodbye!

19:35.374 --> 19:36.742
It was nice being here!

19:37.242 --> 19:38.110
Italy's out.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.046
They're giving each other
hugs and kisses over there.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.348
-We're so sorry.
-Thank you, Paula.

19:43.415 --> 19:44.249
Sorry.

19:44.316 --> 19:46.585
-You did good!
-We appreciate your friendship.

19:46.652 --> 19:47.486
Sorry.

19:47.553 --> 19:49.955
I'm Spanish. I'm not Italian, I'm Spanish.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.058
-[Paula] Here's your replacement.
-[Saúl] Let's all support Spain!

19:53.125 --> 19:55.794
-I'm Spanish!
-[Bianca] What a sell-out!

19:55.861 --> 19:57.062
[Paula] You did great!

19:59.598 --> 20:03.835
[Chris] Myra Robinson from the USA
is now on the bubble, unfortunately.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.137
It comes down to this man -

20:05.204 --> 20:09.374
Abhinav Mahajan,
who can knock out our beloved Myra...

20:09.875 --> 20:10.909
if he has a good run.

20:10.976 --> 20:12.544
[Tiki] He's a motivational speaker.

20:12.611 --> 20:15.414
-And he is a large competitor.
-Yes.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.049
He is six foot, two inches tall,

20:17.115 --> 20:20.953
which obviously gives him a decided
advantage on a lot of these obstacles

20:21.019 --> 20:22.955
because of the distance between them.

20:23.255 --> 20:26.325
There's nothing in my brain.
There's only one thing in my brain.

20:26.391 --> 20:27.859
I have to reach the end goal

20:28.193 --> 20:30.128
and achieve what no one has done before.

20:30.195 --> 20:31.597
End goal. That's it.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.399
[Chris] This kid came all the way
from India to compete,

20:34.466 --> 20:36.468
but Myra's my girl, OK?

20:36.535 --> 20:38.670
I've got to go
with national pride right now.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.239
I do not want to see Myra go home.

20:44.710 --> 20:45.811
[Vidyut] Yeah, Abhinav!

20:46.578 --> 20:48.914
Come on, India! I can't hear you cheering.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.149
[Tiki] This should be an easy one for him.

20:51.216 --> 20:54.152
He's 6 foot 2". It's a 7.5-foot jump.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.254
[Chris] He can make this.

20:57.689 --> 20:58.523
[Tiki] Easily.

20:58.590 --> 21:00.959
Myra is out if he makes this jump.

21:01.526 --> 21:04.763
[Chris] I'm really hoping he face-plants
before he gets to the Faceplant.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.833
And Myra is out, folks.

21:08.233 --> 21:09.768
-We love you, Myra.
-[Tiki] Yes.

21:10.068 --> 21:12.371
-[Chris] We love you, Myra. USA!
-[Tiki] We love you.

21:12.437 --> 21:14.273
[Sarah-Jane] Go, India! Go, India, go!

21:14.706 --> 21:16.008
[Tiki] He's got good hair.

21:16.074 --> 21:18.610
[Chris] You jealous, Tiki?
You'd look good with that look.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.247
[Tiki] The problem with hair like that -
that's at least 45 minutes

21:22.314 --> 21:23.148
to get ready.

21:23.215 --> 21:24.449
You know how long it takes me?

21:24.516 --> 21:26.151
-[Chris] How long?
-[Tiki] 45 seconds.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.086
[Chris] Not even.
You wake up and you're good.

21:28.153 --> 21:31.723
[Tiki] He's long. He can almost reach
this coil without even having to jump.

21:32.424 --> 21:34.960
He can almost...
I feel like he could step across.

21:35.027 --> 21:37.296
-[Chris] He's long, limber--
-[Tiki] Energy Coils.

21:37.362 --> 21:39.164
-[Chris] Yeah.
-[Tiki] He's thinking.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.999
Don't think about it, just do it.

21:41.066 --> 21:43.402
-Your issue is not the Energy Coils.
-[Chris] Yeah.

21:43.468 --> 21:47.005
[Tiki] Your issue is going to be
when you get to the Deadbolts.

21:47.072 --> 21:48.940
You've got to hold that long frame...

21:49.508 --> 21:51.877
dangling over the blood of the Beast.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.148
I... I think... He seems unconfident here.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.618
[Chris] He is a little nervous.
He's doing this awkward...

21:59.685 --> 22:00.886
[Tiki] This is curious.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.388
[Chris] You've got to just go, my brother.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.258
-What is...?
-Just jump!

22:08.060 --> 22:10.395
-[Tiki] What are you doing?
-[Chris] What are you doing?

22:10.729 --> 22:12.664
[Tiki] You're making it worse
on your mind.

22:12.731 --> 22:14.633
[Chris] You're making it worse. Just jump.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.704
Remember, competitors have
six minutes to get through this.

22:18.770 --> 22:19.604
Come on.

22:20.372 --> 22:23.675
[Chris] I've never seen anything...
This guy is just completely stuck.

22:24.643 --> 22:26.278
[Tiki] I don't even know what to think.

22:26.345 --> 22:27.346
He's stuck.

22:27.412 --> 22:30.349
If you're not going to jump,
then we'll just do this.

22:30.949 --> 22:32.451
[Tiki] But he's stuck in his mind.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.152
Call me when he jumps.

22:34.219 --> 22:35.687
Call me when he jumps.

22:36.855 --> 22:37.856
[cheering]

22:38.223 --> 22:40.125
-[Chris] Abhinav!
-[Tiki] What is going...

22:40.192 --> 22:42.427
-Come on. You've got this!
-Jump!

22:44.162 --> 22:47.232
-He's done so many squats!
-Look at him doing squats!

22:48.200 --> 22:49.701
I can't take it anymore!

22:52.270 --> 22:54.706
[Tiki] He's got one minute left
to complete this level.

22:58.510 --> 23:01.046
[Chris] This is me trying to ask Sarah
for her phone number.

23:02.681 --> 23:03.815
Come on, Abhinav!

23:04.249 --> 23:05.517
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

23:05.584 --> 23:07.119
[Tiki] Look at the excitement,

23:07.185 --> 23:09.888
from all the competitors
from all the countries.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.994
[crowd] Yes! Yes, yes! Come on!

23:16.061 --> 23:18.463
-[Tiki] Go for the Thruster.
-[Chris] Get the Thruster.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.132
[Tiki] You're not going to finish.

23:20.198 --> 23:25.137
[Chris and Tiki]
Five, four, three, two, one.

23:27.139 --> 23:29.574
I don't blame him.
The Beast can get into your head.

23:29.641 --> 23:31.977
This is what the competitors
are going through.

23:32.043 --> 23:35.147
This is not his fault.
This is something the Beast throws at you.

23:35.414 --> 23:37.149
[Abhinav] The fear of losing just came in.

23:37.215 --> 23:38.350
After that, I froze.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.551
If I'd had the time,

23:40.118 --> 23:43.355
and didn't have the fear of having
to be number one, I'd have done it.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.256
Good job, man.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.992
He wasted 20 minutes humping
an Energy Coil.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.796
I just want to say that this first level

23:50.862 --> 23:55.467
will be remembered for the new dance
created by Abhinav.

24:03.642 --> 24:04.676
This is the new dance.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.312
-Yeah.
-This is from Bollywood.

24:07.379 --> 24:09.881
-Please try that at home.
-Yeah. That's how we do it.

24:09.948 --> 24:10.782
Try it with us.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.284
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you.

24:12.350 --> 24:13.685
-I love your hair.
-Thanks.

24:13.752 --> 24:15.854
-I want it, I want it.
-He wants my hair.

24:15.921 --> 24:18.757
-Is it fake or real?
-Very real.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.625
Real? Real, real!

24:20.692 --> 24:22.861
-Great, great.
-See you. Bye.

24:25.831 --> 24:28.033
[Tiki] That's the end of Level 1.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.535
Clément Dumais is the man to beat

24:30.602 --> 24:32.704
with 115 points.

24:32.771 --> 24:34.439
[Chris] Bin Xie
is nipping at his heels

24:34.506 --> 24:36.808
in second place with 100 points.

24:37.175 --> 24:39.544
[Tiki] And our American, Andres Encinales,

24:39.611 --> 24:40.946
the naval officer,

24:41.012 --> 24:42.013
he advances.

24:42.080 --> 24:43.582
[Chris] Abhinav Mahajan from India

24:43.648 --> 24:45.150
proved he has a beard,

24:45.484 --> 24:49.354
and that he really, really thinks
Energy Coils are cute.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.057
Ultimate Beastmaster!

24:54.793 --> 24:56.962
[Tiki] Some big news
to start off Level 2...

24:57.028 --> 25:02.033
We just got word that Team India's
Abhinav Mahajan

25:02.100 --> 25:06.938
could not continue due to the shoulder
injury he sustained on the Deadbolts.

25:07.005 --> 25:11.810
Let's go to the Indian hosts,
who are standing by with Abhinav.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.679
I see you're in a sling, man.
What happened?

25:14.746 --> 25:16.114
I don't know...

25:16.915 --> 25:20.719
I was moving from one bolt to the next
when, suddenly, I heard a kind of snap.

25:20.785 --> 25:24.789
Then I went to the physiotherapist. I
asked him, "Can I go for the next level?"

25:24.856 --> 25:25.957
I wanted to give it a try

25:26.024 --> 25:28.727
but, as the officials said,
I cannot do that.

25:29.027 --> 25:32.664
Unfortunately,
Abhinav will have to let the course go.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.335
[Tiki] So with Abhinav injured
and unable to continue,

25:37.402 --> 25:40.238
just seven players
will compete in Level 2,

25:40.305 --> 25:42.674
and only the top five will advance.

25:43.508 --> 25:46.811
[Chris] First up is Giles D'Souza
from India.

25:46.878 --> 25:47.946
Go, India!

25:48.413 --> 25:49.314
[claxon sounds]

25:49.381 --> 25:54.019
[Chris] Giles D'Souza scaling up
the spine of the Beast.

25:54.319 --> 25:58.189
As we know, Sarah,
he's part of the Indian Special Forces.

25:58.256 --> 25:59.958
And in the first segment,

26:00.025 --> 26:03.595
he gave a very good demonstration
on the obstacle course.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.698
[Tiki] Almost! Is he stuck?

26:06.765 --> 26:08.934
Again, it takes a lot
of upper-body strength

26:09.000 --> 26:10.502
and shoulder strength here.

26:10.569 --> 26:13.705
It's actually...
It's harder if you put your leg up.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.807
Come on, Giles.
Come on, Giles. Come on!

26:16.908 --> 26:18.910
Nice. Nice.

26:18.977 --> 26:19.811
[Tiki] He makes it.

26:20.345 --> 26:24.349
[Chris] And he's through Spinal Ascent.
Now it's time to go to Spinal Descent.

26:28.286 --> 26:33.658
[Tiki] Obviously, as you can see,
a bunch of cords that are intertwined

26:33.725 --> 26:35.794
almost like a spider's web...

26:35.860 --> 26:38.863
It looks easier than it actually is
to get down,

26:38.930 --> 26:43.702
because if you take one misstep, you fall
into the blood of the Beast below.

26:45.136 --> 26:46.371
-Good swing.
-Well done.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.707
And I'm hoping
that this Point Thruster gets added.

26:48.773 --> 26:50.575
-He's a good athlete.
-He'll make it.

26:58.216 --> 27:00.051
[Sarah-Jane] Yeah!
Come on, Giles! Come on!

27:00.685 --> 27:03.688
-[Chris] Don't get your feet wet, Giles.
-[Tiki] As he goes for this...

27:03.755 --> 27:06.725
-[Chris] He's got wet feet now.
-[Tiki] Now, he's stuck here.

27:06.791 --> 27:12.063
The rule is all four limbs have to fall
into the blood of the Beast

27:12.130 --> 27:13.498
before you're eliminated.

27:13.565 --> 27:18.637
This could come to a soggy end,
where Giles D'Souza...

27:18.703 --> 27:20.538
-Come on. Let go, Giles!
-No...

27:20.605 --> 27:23.341
-[Chris] He can't get back.
-[Tiki] He's pulling himself up.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.343
[Chris] He's a fighter but he's trying...

27:25.410 --> 27:27.145
-Poodle--
-[Tiki] He's proving me wrong.

27:28.513 --> 27:29.648
[Chris] Come on, Giles.

27:29.714 --> 27:31.149
Come on, come on!

27:31.216 --> 27:34.419
[Tiki] He has already expended
a lot of upper-body strength.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.721
-Come on, Giles!
-Come on, Giles!

27:36.788 --> 27:38.623
You can do this, Giles.

27:39.891 --> 27:41.760
-[Tiki] Giles cannot do it.
-[Chris] Giles!

27:41.826 --> 27:44.896
[Tiki] He has to let himself go
into the blood of the Beast.

27:45.563 --> 27:51.636
Valiant effort. But he did get that
Point Thruster for a total of 105 points.

27:51.703 --> 27:53.338
Chris, that's why they're risky.

27:53.405 --> 27:56.508
[Chris] He got stuck underneath
the Stomach Churn.

27:56.574 --> 28:00.211
The last place you want to be caught
is underneath the stomach of the Beast.

28:03.014 --> 28:04.783
My hands got ripped again, man.

28:05.450 --> 28:06.351
So...

28:07.085 --> 28:08.953
It burnt my hand when I held it.

28:09.287 --> 28:10.922
I hope I make it to the next round.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.658
But it seems sketchy right now.

28:14.659 --> 28:17.662
[Tiki] Next up
is Bin Xie representing China.

28:18.063 --> 28:20.231
[Chris] You know,
he's got a bit of a rivalry going on

28:20.298 --> 28:21.800
with Clément Dumais of France.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.168
We talked to Bin earlier.

28:23.234 --> 28:26.604
No surprise -
the military man ain't backing down.

28:28.173 --> 28:32.477
[Bin] I don't think the Frenchman
is stronger than me.

28:32.811 --> 28:34.446
I'll beat him in this round.

28:35.480 --> 28:38.917
[Chris] Now, remember, coming down Spinal
Descent, there's a Point Thruster,

28:38.983 --> 28:43.521
but if you try to get it
and your foot gets in that water,

28:43.588 --> 28:46.991
you'll have a slippery time
getting through that Digestive Track.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.127
So let's see what Bin Xie wants to do.

28:49.194 --> 28:51.930
[Tiki] He's going for it.
And he gets the Point Thruster.

28:51.996 --> 28:56.134
That speed and strength. Nicely done.

28:56.201 --> 28:58.837
[Tiki] He pulls himself back over
to the Stomach Churn.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.741
[Chris] He probably didn't care, like:
"I'm in the Navy. My feet are always wet."

29:02.807 --> 29:06.177
[Tiki] He's not afraid
of the soggy bottom below.

29:06.511 --> 29:07.879
[Chris] Hmm, soggy...

29:07.946 --> 29:09.347
Oh, Bin Xie!

29:09.414 --> 29:12.250
[Tiki] Bin Xie, now on the Stomach Churn.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.721
Those gears...

29:18.022 --> 29:20.658
[Chris] Oh! Nice jump by Bin Xie!

29:20.725 --> 29:23.394
[Tiki] On to that last gear,
which is seven feet across.

29:23.461 --> 29:25.029
[Chris] He's on the Digestive Track.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.865
[Tiki] He has to fly up Digestive Track.

29:26.931 --> 29:29.234
[Chris] With dry feet.
He should be able to get through.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.871
[Tiki] You have to get there at the apex,
or near it, so you can make the jump.

29:33.872 --> 29:34.706
And he made it.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.274
He made the jump.

29:36.341 --> 29:37.308
Wow.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.443
Keep it up!

29:38.510 --> 29:40.478
[Tiki] Those Dreadmills
sway back and forth.

29:40.545 --> 29:43.414
[Chris] Now, he's at Chain Reaction.
Bin Xie's making it look easy.

29:43.481 --> 29:46.351
[Tiki] Clément's
intently watching every move.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.620
The Monkey King
is powering up some points,

29:48.686 --> 29:51.523
hoping to put himself safely out
of the Frenchman's reach.

29:52.023 --> 29:56.394
His friends call him "the Monkey King".
He has to swing back and forth.

29:56.461 --> 29:58.396
[Chris] This is how Bin Xie gets to work.

29:58.797 --> 30:00.532
There are extra points.

30:00.598 --> 30:03.334
[Tiki] Is he going to go?
And he gets another Point Thruster.

30:03.401 --> 30:04.269
[Chris] Wow.

30:04.702 --> 30:07.405
[Tiki] He's already gotten
two of the Point Thrusters

30:07.472 --> 30:11.376
as he's now trying to make this last leap
over to Vertabrace.

30:11.676 --> 30:13.945
[Chris]
Bin Xie is flying through this, though.

30:14.012 --> 30:17.382
[Tiki] He missed his first attempt
to reach the Vertabrace, but oh, man!

30:17.448 --> 30:18.550
He's still hanging on.

30:18.917 --> 30:21.219
We've seen competitors get stuck here.

30:21.286 --> 30:24.622
Bin Xie
is showing incredible grip strength.

30:24.689 --> 30:26.457
This kid is not giving up.

30:26.524 --> 30:28.493
You've really got to go Tarzan here.

30:29.027 --> 30:32.630
You almost need to go back
and grab a farther away chain.

30:33.865 --> 30:37.135
Here he goes, attempting
to start his momentum again.

30:37.202 --> 30:40.004
God, this takes a lot of athleticism.

30:40.071 --> 30:44.742
Keep going! Keep going!

30:44.809 --> 30:47.378
[Chris] He's too low right now.
Bin Xie's coming in too low.

30:47.445 --> 30:49.414
Don't give up.

30:49.480 --> 30:53.051
-[Tiki] It's over. Bin Xie!
-[Chris] Bin Xie!

30:53.117 --> 30:54.853
Xie's out of luck on that one.

30:54.919 --> 30:57.422
-[Tiki] But good run.
-[Chris] Good run, China!

30:57.755 --> 31:00.792
[Bin] I'm disappointed.

31:01.526 --> 31:02.927
I've learnt my lesson.

31:03.361 --> 31:04.996
I'll learn from this experience.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.598
I'll do it slowly.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.435
[Tiki] France's parkour expert,
Clément Dumais,

31:10.501 --> 31:12.904
has already smashed
through the Spinal Ascent.

31:14.372 --> 31:16.040
[Chris] Now, he takes on Spinal Descent.

31:16.107 --> 31:18.810
-Come on, Clément!
-Go, France!

31:20.044 --> 31:24.682
[Tiki] Remember, from Level 1,
Clément was a Point Thruster king.

31:24.749 --> 31:26.885
-[Chris] A PTK.
-[Tiki] He got three of them.

31:26.951 --> 31:30.855
The Point Thrusters obviously
add ten points to your score total.

31:31.189 --> 31:34.859
So if you can mitigate the risk
and do it effectively...

31:35.693 --> 31:39.664
-Kicking the Point Thruster easily!
-[Chris] That was PTK at his finest there.

31:39.964 --> 31:42.267
That's why he's the king
of the Point Thrusters.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.602
[Tiki] Coming back to the Stomach Churn.

31:44.669 --> 31:48.039
He's scaled the Eiffel Tower,
so I don't think he'll struggle here.

31:48.106 --> 31:51.743
This part is really easy
for our athlete, Clément,

31:51.809 --> 31:55.179
who is a professional tracer.

31:55.647 --> 31:56.614
[Tiki] Wow!

31:56.681 --> 31:59.017
[Chris] Clément's spinning
round the stomach churners

31:59.083 --> 32:00.785
like a croissant in a display case.

32:00.852 --> 32:01.719
[Tiki laughs]

32:05.456 --> 32:07.625
[Tiki] It looks like
he's losing his bearings.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.027
[Chris] Will the Beast eat him?

32:09.093 --> 32:09.961
Let's see.

32:10.662 --> 32:13.731
[Tiki] He falls off. He doesn't even look
at the second Point Thruster.

32:13.798 --> 32:14.666
[Chris] Wow.

32:14.732 --> 32:17.669
[Tiki] Now, he has to fly
up the Digestive Track.

32:17.735 --> 32:20.872
It's all about speed and urgency
to get to the top of the track

32:20.939 --> 32:23.207
because if you don't jump
when it's still high,

32:23.274 --> 32:26.244
it's almost impossible
to land on the Dreadmills.

32:27.445 --> 32:28.546
He's there...

32:29.647 --> 32:31.950
He's reached the Dreadmills.

32:33.885 --> 32:35.653
[Chris] This kid is unstoppable.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.426
[Tiki] And there he goes.
He makes it onto the landing pad.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.294
Easy!

32:43.361 --> 32:46.898
[Tiki] Chain Reaction is all about
momentum, grip strength.

32:48.967 --> 32:54.205
And power to thrust yourself
through that last, very large gap.

32:54.272 --> 32:58.476
[Chris] Also, what Clément did was jump
the highest I've ever seen anyone jump.

32:58.543 --> 33:02.880
[Tiki] With that Point Thruster,
Clément has taken the lead from Bin Xie.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.419
-Oh, wow.
-[Chris] Clément fell.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.921
[groaning]

33:10.655 --> 33:14.359
[Tiki] Oh, my goodness.
He completely missed that.

33:14.425 --> 33:20.031
Again, the risk reward of going
for the Point Thruster shows itself.

33:20.098 --> 33:22.200
He got the extra ten points.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.169
But he completely stopped his momentum.

33:25.236 --> 33:28.406
He face-plants
into the blood of the Beast.

33:29.173 --> 33:34.979
He did manage to make it to first place
with 210 points.

33:35.046 --> 33:37.515
Also my goal weight - 210.

33:38.082 --> 33:39.617
You are...

33:39.684 --> 33:41.686
-What a turn of events!
-Oh, no! Not them!

33:42.253 --> 33:44.756
-They're back again.
-Not these Italians again!

33:44.822 --> 33:46.524
He fell asleep!

33:47.558 --> 33:49.227
Thank you!

33:49.293 --> 33:52.997
They're pretending to be nice,
but careful, maybe it's poisonous...

33:53.064 --> 33:54.465
Clearly...

33:54.532 --> 33:58.703
There are no Italians here.

34:01.272 --> 34:05.643
[Tiki] Next up is our jacked firefighter
from Spain...

34:06.377 --> 34:08.579
Samuel Muñoz.

34:10.148 --> 34:13.784
It's best to be in shape
to do the work that I do.

34:14.284 --> 34:19.991
I chose to be a firefighter because
I think helping other people is great.

34:20.058 --> 34:24.562
It also allows me to stay in shape

34:25.362 --> 34:26.898
as part of my routine.

34:27.264 --> 34:29.067
I compete against myself.

34:29.500 --> 34:32.437
I am competing to pass some tests.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.806
And I will be the one
that defeats the Beast!

34:38.275 --> 34:39.177
Come on, Samuel!

34:39.243 --> 34:41.212
-Go, Samuel!
-Come on!

34:41.813 --> 34:45.349
[Chris] Samuel's getting through
Spinal Descent relatively easy here.

34:45.416 --> 34:47.452
But see if he goes
for that Point Thruster.

34:47.918 --> 34:49.487
[Tiki] I'm going to guess "no".

34:49.554 --> 34:52.255
He's very muscle-bound, so he's heavy.

34:52.322 --> 34:54.625
You can see the musculature in his legs.

34:55.126 --> 34:57.027
It might not be worth the risk for him.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.698
I'm sure that, as a firefighter,
he faces tests much harder than this one.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.567
You can do it. Perfect!

35:02.633 --> 35:03.768
[Chris] Wow.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.369
[Tiki] And with that Point Thruster,

35:05.436 --> 35:08.606
he moves into fifth place,
back onto the Stomach Churn.

35:09.006 --> 35:12.110
[Chris] Look at those biceps. I'd like
to take a bite out of those, folks.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.246
-[Tiki] No, you wouldn't.
-[Chris] You're right, I wouldn't.

35:15.313 --> 35:17.248
Who cares? If I'm drunk enough...

35:17.315 --> 35:18.382
[Tiki laughs]

35:18.850 --> 35:20.251
[Tiki] Maybe he banged his thigh.

35:20.318 --> 35:22.220
[Chris] He banged his quadricep,
looks like.

35:22.286 --> 35:23.821
[Tiki] Thigh bruises aren't fun,

35:24.088 --> 35:26.124
especially when you're spinning around.

35:26.491 --> 35:28.559
You start to lose your orientation.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.462
He's not going
for the second Point Thruster.

35:31.529 --> 35:32.363
[Chris] Smart move.

35:32.430 --> 35:38.202
[Tiki] This fall to this last Stomach
Churn wheel is very difficult.

35:38.269 --> 35:39.504
It's all about timing.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.606
-It's spinning quickly.
-It gets harder.

35:41.672 --> 35:43.174
-Come on!
-Jump! Jump!

35:43.741 --> 35:45.910
-He fell!
-No!

35:46.911 --> 35:48.312
He went too far!

35:48.379 --> 35:50.615
[Chris] And he overshot the jump!

35:51.616 --> 35:53.751
That looked like it hurt.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.454
[Chris, in Spanish]
For heaven's sake, Spain!

35:56.754 --> 35:59.190
[Tiki] Let's see the replay.
What happens here...

35:59.257 --> 36:01.192
He gets through the first two.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.662
That's where he hit his leg,
and you can see it affected him.

36:05.229 --> 36:07.198
And here's the jump to the last--

36:07.765 --> 36:08.733
Oh, man!

36:08.799 --> 36:10.034
That looks painful.

36:10.101 --> 36:13.304
I don't think he felt it. He's got
muscle upon muscle on his thighs.

36:13.804 --> 36:15.006
That was a hell of a bump...

36:16.274 --> 36:18.376
as if someone had thrown a sack of acorns.

36:18.442 --> 36:20.077
That's how I bounced on the mat.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.413
[The Beast growls]

36:22.813 --> 36:27.218
[Tiki] The next competitor,
Andres Encinales, from the United States.

36:27.285 --> 36:28.386
USA!

36:29.487 --> 36:30.354
USA!

36:30.421 --> 36:32.356
[Tiki] You hear that call? That's USA!

36:36.627 --> 36:41.799
[Andres] I've never really been
into sports like football or basketball.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.168
But I always loved fighting.

36:44.235 --> 36:47.738
[commentator] Encinales coming in,
throwing out some punches. Good combo.

36:47.805 --> 36:51.709
[Andres] Once I joined the military, I
started training in Jujutsu and Muay Thai.

36:51.776 --> 36:53.344
I've been competing ever since.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.482
The Indian hosts
are looking for some US face time.

36:58.583 --> 37:01.219
-Andres Encinales.
-What do you see when you look at him?

37:01.285 --> 37:03.788
[Sarah-Jane] Someone Chris
should not get into a fight with.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.724
I'd never fight him,
unless he said something bad to you.

37:06.791 --> 37:08.125
Then I'd fight anybody.

37:10.861 --> 37:12.129
[Chris] Oh, no!

37:12.196 --> 37:14.065
[commentators] Oh, oh, oh!

37:14.131 --> 37:15.132
[Tiki] Wow!

37:15.199 --> 37:16.300
[Chris] Andres!

37:16.367 --> 37:17.535
[Tiki] Andres is--

37:18.002 --> 37:19.203
[Vidyut] Oh, no.

37:19.270 --> 37:22.039
[Tiki] Andres is ready.
This is all part of the plan.

37:22.106 --> 37:25.009
I don't think that was part of the plan,
but he made do.

37:25.076 --> 37:26.377
[commentators] Wow.

37:26.811 --> 37:29.714
-[Tiki] You get a clap for that, Andres.
-[Vidyut] Yes!

37:29.780 --> 37:31.482
[Chris] America's giving 110%.

37:31.549 --> 37:33.084
[Vidyut] When Tiki played football,

37:33.150 --> 37:35.319
he gave it more than he could have
ever imagined.

37:35.386 --> 37:36.254
[Tiki] You're right.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.488
I left it all on the field.

37:37.555 --> 37:39.457
You also left a lot of my dad's money...

37:39.523 --> 37:40.391
[all laugh]

37:40.458 --> 37:43.961
on the field, because
he used to gamble on you quite often.

37:45.296 --> 37:47.198
-[Chris] Come on, Andres!
-[Vidyut] Come on!

37:47.265 --> 37:49.700
[Chris] He has to be
getting disorientated.

37:49.767 --> 37:52.870
[Tiki] He has to get closer to the edge,
otherwise it's too far of a jump.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.138
[Sarah-Jane] He'll be sick.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.606
What's he doing?

37:55.673 --> 37:57.975
[Chris] He's taking a lot of time
on the Spinning Churn.

37:58.042 --> 38:00.011
[commentators] USA! USA!

38:00.077 --> 38:02.513
-[Tiki] Oh, he made it.
-[Chris] Yes!

38:02.580 --> 38:04.181
[Vidyut] That's how you do it.

38:04.248 --> 38:07.351
-[Chris] He fell. He hit that edge thing.
-[Sarah-Jane] Wow.

38:08.719 --> 38:11.389
-OK.
-[Chris] He has to get up this quick.

38:11.455 --> 38:13.324
[Sarah-Jane] He knocked his shiny head.

38:13.391 --> 38:14.759
Oh, he hit his shiny head?

38:14.825 --> 38:16.827
[Tiki] There's nothing wrong
with a shiny head.

38:16.894 --> 38:18.362
He... Yeah.

38:18.429 --> 38:20.464
You and him should have a shine-off, Tiki.

38:21.899 --> 38:25.336
[Tiki] Remember, you've got to get
to the top of this thing quickly,

38:25.403 --> 38:28.472
so that you can make this jump
onto the track.

38:28.539 --> 38:30.374
Oh!

38:31.309 --> 38:35.379
[Tiki] The issue is, if you don't have
urgency going up the Digestive Track,

38:35.446 --> 38:38.516
it is impossible to jump over
to the Dreadmills.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.218
No excuses, I did my best.

38:41.952 --> 38:44.088
I've got to see how
the other competitors do.

38:44.422 --> 38:45.690
May the best man win.

38:45.756 --> 38:50.127
[Tiki] Andres has 95 points.
It puts him into fourth place.

38:50.194 --> 38:53.297
-Alright, guys.
-Vidyut and Sarah.

38:53.664 --> 38:56.334
-[Tiki] We like it when they visit.
-We're friends with India.

38:56.400 --> 38:57.668
Sarah, call me.

38:58.502 --> 39:02.573
Remember, only five competitors
will advance to the next level.

39:03.441 --> 39:06.477
[Tiki] Samuel Muñoz
is currently on the bubble

39:06.544 --> 39:08.045
with 85 points,

39:08.112 --> 39:09.914
as Minghua He...

39:10.114 --> 39:12.350
-[Chris] Minghua, what?
-[Tiki] Minghua, huh?

39:12.416 --> 39:13.651
[Chris] "Minghua, why?"

39:13.718 --> 39:15.386
[Tiki] ...takes on Level 2 of the Beast.

39:17.188 --> 39:20.658
He's a really young parkour expert
from Guangdong.

39:24.028 --> 39:28.232
[Chris] Alright, he's only 20 years old.
Minghua's one of our younger competitors.

39:28.299 --> 39:31.202
And a self-described grandma's boy.

39:31.635 --> 39:35.840
[Tiki] And that's it for Samuel,
our firefighter from Spain.

39:35.906 --> 39:38.709
He is knocked out of the competition.

39:38.776 --> 39:40.244
Bye-bye, Spain!

39:40.878 --> 39:43.347
Goodbye, Spain!

39:43.414 --> 39:46.350
-What happened? Goodbye!
-Those Italians are delightful.

39:49.153 --> 39:50.388
[Tiki] Minghua...

39:51.188 --> 39:55.826
delicately making his way
down Spinal Descent.

39:57.094 --> 40:00.398
All competitors have a decision
to make when they get to the bottom.

40:00.464 --> 40:04.869
Do you go for
the 10-point Point Thruster below?

40:04.935 --> 40:06.337
It's like he's not even aware of it,

40:06.404 --> 40:10.274
or his pre-race strategy
was just to get further through.

40:10.341 --> 40:11.375
He didn't even look.

40:11.442 --> 40:14.345
[Chris] Yeah, Minghua He
is only 20 years old,

40:14.412 --> 40:18.215
so our competitors who are older know
what it's like to have the room spin.

40:18.282 --> 40:19.283
[Tiki laughs]

40:21.000 --> 40:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

40:28.292 --> 40:31.061
You can do it. You're the best.

40:31.128 --> 40:33.831
[Chris] Minghua He is spinning on that.
I think he's having fun.

40:33.898 --> 40:36.333
[Tiki] He's sitting down,
somewhat disorientated.

40:36.700 --> 40:38.035
-Wow!
-[Chris] Oh, Minghua!

40:38.102 --> 40:41.238
[Tiki] That was like a rash attempt,
but he made it.

40:41.305 --> 40:44.508
-The last of the Stomach Churner--
-[Chris] It puts him in third place.

40:44.575 --> 40:47.511
You'll notice he's rubbing
the bottom part of his right leg,

40:47.578 --> 40:48.913
so we'll see what happened.

40:48.979 --> 40:53.217
[Tiki] This is not a competition
for the faint in physicality.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.686
You are going to get banged around.

40:56.020 --> 40:58.689
He flies into the Digestive Track.
He's got to move.

40:58.756 --> 41:00.958
-He's got to get up quicker.
-[Chris] Come on!

41:02.393 --> 41:06.197
[Tiki] The Digestive Track falls down
into the blood of the Beast.

41:06.263 --> 41:09.700
-He is stuck.
-[Chris] The Beast is going to eat him.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.001
[Tiki] Can he make it up there?

41:11.068 --> 41:13.237
The problem is,
even if he does get to the top,

41:13.304 --> 41:15.473
he has to jump out
to get the five points.

41:15.539 --> 41:16.574
Can he make it?

41:16.640 --> 41:19.643
He can't make it.
I think he injured his leg.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.512
[Chris] No!

41:21.579 --> 41:24.915
[Tiki] He conceded,
because he got out of the Digestive Track.

41:24.982 --> 41:26.750
He did get the five points.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.286
[Minghua] I injured my leg
when I knocked into the platform.

41:29.353 --> 41:31.455
It hurt when I jumped
and landed on it again.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.090
My form today has been mediocre.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.893
If I can move on to the next stage,
I'll perform better.

41:35.960 --> 41:40.297
[Tiki] Minghua from China
accumulates 115 points,

41:40.364 --> 41:42.600
which currently leaves him in third place,

41:42.666 --> 41:45.870
with one more competitor to go
for Level 2,

41:45.936 --> 41:47.538
Marc Vela.

41:52.343 --> 41:55.579
[Marc] My parents passed
their passion for sports on to us.

41:55.646 --> 41:58.883
My dad did athletics
and my mom was a sports journalist.

41:58.949 --> 42:02.586
I started doing athletics
when I was seven,

42:02.653 --> 42:04.855
and then one day I tried pole vaulting.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.957
-[man 2] Go!
-[man 3] Well done!

42:07.024 --> 42:09.760
[Marc] Pole vaulting
is a very explosive sport.

42:10.294 --> 42:11.295
What sets me apart

42:11.362 --> 42:15.132
is that my sport is very different
to what the other contestants do.

42:15.699 --> 42:20.004
My sport calls for
a lot of physical training,

42:20.070 --> 42:24.508
so many of the exercises that I do

42:24.575 --> 42:29.747
are very similar to those
in the Ultimate Beastmaster show.

42:30.381 --> 42:33.150
Well, I will be the one
that finishes off the Beast.

42:36.954 --> 42:39.990
[Chris] Marc Vela, our final competitor
of the night, going for Spain,

42:40.057 --> 42:42.293
putting Andres from the United States
on the bubble.

42:42.359 --> 42:44.295
Team USA is on the ropes.

42:44.361 --> 42:46.196
This would be the knock-out blow.

42:46.263 --> 42:47.498
Let's see what happens.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.466
-[Paula] Come on, Marc!
-[Saúl] Great!

42:49.533 --> 42:50.401
Well done, Marc!

42:50.467 --> 42:55.673
[Tiki] All he needs is one more jump
to knock Andres out.

42:55.739 --> 42:58.609
I'm not rooting against you, Spain,
but how about you fall?

43:00.077 --> 43:03.614
The United States has been knocked out
of this competition.

43:06.917 --> 43:13.023
[singing in Spanish]

43:13.090 --> 43:17.194
[Tiki] Marc Vela comes out way before
the bottom of the Spinal Descent.

43:17.261 --> 43:18.295
[Chris] Interesting.

43:19.129 --> 43:21.065
[Tiki] He decided
against the Point Thruster.

43:21.131 --> 43:25.636
He's a pole vaulter.
This must be a piece of cake for him.

43:26.003 --> 43:26.937
[Chris] Wow.

43:27.004 --> 43:30.474
[Tiki] Let's not forget, it's all about
the strategy of accumulating points.

43:35.913 --> 43:37.715
Oh! España!

43:39.383 --> 43:41.018
No!

43:41.085 --> 43:42.119
[Tiki] What happened?

43:42.186 --> 43:46.156
[Chris] España shot out
of the Digestive Track!

43:46.557 --> 43:48.659
[Marc] I didn't think
it would be so slippery.

43:49.126 --> 43:52.596
It sounds silly, but it's really slippery.

43:53.030 --> 43:53.998
I don't know.

43:54.531 --> 43:57.134
It's all a bit absurd, but that's OK.

43:57.601 --> 43:59.803
[Tiki] Here's where we stand
after Level 2.

43:59.870 --> 44:04.408
Clément Dumais from France
is leading the way with 210 points.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.512
Bin Xie is pulling in second
with 205 points.

44:08.579 --> 44:14.318
Marc Vela from Spain - 115,
tied with Minghua from China.

44:15.019 --> 44:18.689
Giles from India with 105 points.

44:18.756 --> 44:21.358
And that does it for Level 2.

44:21.425 --> 44:23.460
And then there were five.

44:23.527 --> 44:25.829
They will be advancing to Level 3.

44:28.198 --> 44:29.867
[Chris] Let's kick off Level 3.

44:30.267 --> 44:31.702
[Tiki] I've got to tell you, so far,

44:31.769 --> 44:34.271
it's been all about the Frenchman,
Clément Dumais,

44:34.338 --> 44:35.939
and Bin Xie of China,

44:36.006 --> 44:38.642
with the top two spots in an epic battle.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.278
I can teach you Kung fu.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.680
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

44:42.946 --> 44:45.649
The Frenchman surpassed my ranking,

44:45.716 --> 44:47.818
so I need to get more points
in this round.

44:49.453 --> 44:50.621
I'm always thinking

44:50.688 --> 44:53.891
about the Chinese contestant
gradually catching up to my score.

44:57.127 --> 44:57.961
Good luck.

44:58.028 --> 44:59.196
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

44:59.263 --> 45:00.431
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

45:00.497 --> 45:01.331
Cool.

45:01.398 --> 45:02.232
Good luck.

45:04.201 --> 45:05.636
[Tiki] Here we go. Here we go.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.237
First up, from China,

45:07.304 --> 45:10.708
Bin Xie comes into Level 3
with 205 points.

45:10.774 --> 45:12.810
He's currently second place.

45:13.610 --> 45:15.546
[Chris] Bin Xie is a former
Navy Special Op

45:15.612 --> 45:17.614
that turned
into a barbeque restaurant owner,

45:17.681 --> 45:19.717
which is the normal progression in China.

45:20.150 --> 45:20.984
[Tiki] Wow.

45:21.351 --> 45:22.753
[cheering]

45:23.721 --> 45:26.557
Nicely done.

45:27.691 --> 45:29.393
Nice kick.

45:29.460 --> 45:33.430
[Tiki] Another five points he gets
by getting to the second of the handholds.

45:33.997 --> 45:38.202
Nicely done.
Now he's at the Coil Crawl.

45:38.936 --> 45:41.572
[Tiki] Each one of these Coil Crawls -
eight feet long -

45:41.638 --> 45:43.273
is worth five points.

45:43.340 --> 45:48.345
They sink into the fuel of the pyramid,
so you have to be quick and efficient.

45:49.113 --> 45:51.448
[Chris] Remember,
Bin Xie's nickname is the Monkey King

45:51.515 --> 45:53.250
and he's doing his thing right now.

45:57.955 --> 46:00.657
These things are squirting water.
Did you notice that?

46:00.724 --> 46:04.294
[Tiki] Yes, they've been down
into the fuel of the pyramids.

46:04.361 --> 46:05.929
They have water in them.

46:06.764 --> 46:08.232
Faster. He needs to do it fast.

46:08.665 --> 46:11.401
[Tiki] They start sinking
as soon as the competitors touch it.

46:11.468 --> 46:14.638
If you don't get through it quick enough,
you don't have a chance.

46:14.705 --> 46:16.406
Grab the Hangman.

46:16.473 --> 46:19.276
He tried. He's going to have to leap
in order to get that.

46:19.343 --> 46:20.544
He has to time it correctly.

46:20.611 --> 46:21.812
[Chris] Oh!

46:23.247 --> 46:26.316
Monkey King, don't give up.
He's going to give it one more try.

46:26.383 --> 46:27.851
[Tiki] Oh, he's gone.

46:27.918 --> 46:29.820
He could not come through.

46:30.287 --> 46:33.423
-[Chris] And what do you say? Bin Xie!
-[Tiki] Bin Xie!

46:33.490 --> 46:37.194
[Bin] I thought I could reach it.

46:38.095 --> 46:39.797
I'll do better in the next round.

46:40.397 --> 46:44.034
[Tiki] 240 points for Bin Xie!

46:44.401 --> 46:48.438
Only two of these competitors
will move forward to Level 4 -

46:48.505 --> 46:52.176
Giles D'Souza is up next
on Level 3 of the Beast.

46:52.409 --> 46:55.712
India! India! Come on, Giles!

46:55.779 --> 46:58.849
[Tiki] He comes in with an aggregate score
of 105 points,

46:58.916 --> 47:00.184
but get this, Chris,

47:00.250 --> 47:03.420
because our leader, Bin Xie,
has 240 points,

47:03.487 --> 47:07.925
and our second-place competitor,
Clément Dumais, who hasn't even run yet,

47:07.991 --> 47:09.560
has 210 points,

47:09.626 --> 47:15.632
Giles D'Souza needs 110 points
just to have a chance to go forward.

47:15.699 --> 47:18.368
He'll have to make it
almost all the way through Hangman

47:18.435 --> 47:21.572
and hit all three Point Thrusters
just to rack up enough points.

47:22.039 --> 47:23.974
He's hanging by a thread here at Level 3.

47:24.708 --> 47:26.810
-Come on, Giles!
-Come on, boy.

47:27.644 --> 47:28.679
Yeah!

47:30.080 --> 47:31.181
[Chris] Oh!

47:31.248 --> 47:35.352
-[Tiki] What was that?
-[Chris] Giles D'Souza took a D'Snoozer.

47:35.919 --> 47:37.521
[commentators groan]

47:37.588 --> 47:39.156
Awesome!

47:41.325 --> 47:43.894
[Chris] So that's not 110 points.

47:44.094 --> 47:50.100
[Tiki] Zero points for Giles D'Souza, who
needed 110 just to be in the competition.

47:50.167 --> 47:52.069
[Giles] When you do parkour, in our minds,

47:52.135 --> 47:55.639
we're only tuned into
using the edge for a push.

47:56.106 --> 47:59.610
That's what happened. I used the edge
but forgot it's a moving platform.

47:59.676 --> 48:00.978
So the edge moved.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.881
LONG LIVE SPAIN!

48:03.947 --> 48:05.215
[Tiki] Next up, from Spain,

48:05.716 --> 48:07.451
Marc Vela.

48:07.517 --> 48:10.954
Marc has a similar situation
that Giles D'Souza had.

48:11.021 --> 48:13.891
At 115 points through levels 1 and 2,

48:13.957 --> 48:18.528
he's got to score 100 just to
have a chance to qualify for Level 4.

48:18.595 --> 48:22.132
Go, Marc! Come on. Focus.

48:22.199 --> 48:23.300
[klaxon sounds]

48:23.367 --> 48:25.636
[Chris] He has the upper body for it,
I'll tell you that.

48:25.702 --> 48:28.472
[Tiki] Upper-body strength is needed.
And...

48:28.538 --> 48:30.173
[commentators groan]

48:30.240 --> 48:31.275
[Tiki] Again!

48:32.109 --> 48:34.411
So much harder than it looks.

48:34.478 --> 48:37.281
-Jesus Christ! What was that?
-[Saúl] Let's take a look.

48:38.348 --> 48:41.618
[Marc] I focused too much on the
treadmill, which was going really fast,

48:41.685 --> 48:44.621
and I missed the handle
I was supposed to hold on to.

48:44.688 --> 48:46.189
I only grabbed it with one hand.

48:46.690 --> 48:48.859
It's a shame,
but I've had a great time so far,

48:48.926 --> 48:51.595
so I can't really say
anything bad about it.

48:53.430 --> 48:55.599
[commentators shouting]

48:55.666 --> 48:58.869
Hit him! Hit him!
They are absolutely shameless.

48:59.536 --> 49:02.406
Have you seen the French?
Oh, well...

49:02.472 --> 49:05.542
We need to be serious,
but that's too funny.

49:05.609 --> 49:08.712
[Tiki] And just like Giles D'Souza,

49:08.779 --> 49:12.282
Marc Vela has been knocked out
of this competition.

49:12.349 --> 49:16.753
Clément Dumais has been on top of
the leaderboard for the last two levels.

49:16.820 --> 49:18.455
The big question remains:

49:18.522 --> 49:20.857
can the man who once climbed
the Eiffel Tower

49:20.924 --> 49:25.395
overcome Bin Xie's monumental score
of 240 points.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.864
[claxon sounds]

49:28.732 --> 49:31.435
France's champion, Clément Dumais, is off.

49:31.501 --> 49:35.505
-He's 23. That was good. Well done.
-That's how to do it.

49:35.572 --> 49:37.574
[Chris] Easy jump onto Prism Strike.

49:38.275 --> 49:39.109
[Tiki] He nails it.

49:39.176 --> 49:43.814
The magic number for Clément Dumais
is 270 points.

49:43.880 --> 49:46.016
If he gets to 270 points,

49:46.083 --> 49:51.822
it is mathematically impossible for
Minghua He to make it to Level 4.

49:54.291 --> 49:57.961
Clément is making his way through
the eight-foot Coil Crawls.

49:58.028 --> 50:00.130
Each one of these is worth five points.

50:00.197 --> 50:03.400
[Chris] And as he's crawling through them,
it's getting lower and lower.

50:03.834 --> 50:07.304
He has to get through this quick if
he wants any chance to get to Hangman.

50:07.904 --> 50:10.207
I've not played a good game of Hangman
in a while.

50:10.273 --> 50:13.777
-After this, you want to do Tic-Tac-Toe?
-[Tiki] Yes, let's play Tic-Tac-Toe.

50:15.479 --> 50:17.514
[Tiki] Bin Xie is keeping a close eye
on his rival.

50:22.152 --> 50:24.955
He has to get to the end.
He has to focus on his feet.

50:25.022 --> 50:26.990
-Make the jump here.
-[Chris] Can he make it?

50:27.958 --> 50:31.061
[Tiki] Just a little bit too high
for Clément Dumais.

50:33.096 --> 50:36.299
[Clément] I could have made it,
but I missed the jump by a second,

50:36.366 --> 50:38.435
so I missed the landing
by three centimeters.

50:39.269 --> 50:42.539
It's progress, but I really wanted
to widen the gap and I didn't.

50:43.073 --> 50:44.975
So now it's down to the next level.

50:45.909 --> 50:47.944
[Spanish commentators groaning]

50:50.013 --> 50:53.283
Sorry, Spaniards,
but we're the ones in first place.

50:53.617 --> 50:58.088
Clément Dumais finishes with 245 points,

50:58.155 --> 51:00.791
which propels him into first place,

51:00.857 --> 51:04.494
and guarantees his entry into Level 4.

51:05.262 --> 51:08.465
Now, on the bubble, is Bin Xie.
Here's the situation, though.

51:08.532 --> 51:14.905
With 240 points, he is 125 points
ahead of Minghua He.

51:14.971 --> 51:16.073
So Minghua He

51:16.139 --> 51:18.375
is going to have to run
a damn-near perfect run

51:18.442 --> 51:23.413
just to get a chance to knock
his countryman out of Level 4.

51:23.480 --> 51:27.451
There is going to be a Chinese competitor.
It's just a matter of which one.

51:27.517 --> 51:31.054
[Bin Gu] This round
is all about upper-body strength.

51:31.121 --> 51:34.624
It shouldn't be a problem for Andy
since he's light and thin.

51:34.991 --> 51:38.995
[Tiki] Can Minghua He run a perfect run

51:39.062 --> 51:41.431
and put himself into Level 4

51:41.832 --> 51:47.137
and a chance at $10,000
and the title of Beastmaster?

51:47.204 --> 51:48.371
[claxon sounds]

51:48.738 --> 51:51.074
-[Tiki] Here we go, Andy.
-[Chris] Andy!

51:54.511 --> 51:56.346
[Chris and Tiki] Oh!

51:56.413 --> 51:58.248
[Chris] And that is not going to do it.

51:58.682 --> 52:00.250
Wow.

52:00.550 --> 52:03.453
-[Chris] Minghua He--
-[Tiki] What the hell was that?

52:03.520 --> 52:06.123
[Chris] All I've got to say is, huh? Huh?

52:06.490 --> 52:08.024
Wow, that was crazy.

52:08.091 --> 52:11.261
[Tiki] It took me ten minutes
to get in my mind how to set this up,

52:11.328 --> 52:12.829
and you did that?

52:12.896 --> 52:16.266
[Chris] So it's France versus China
in Level 4

52:16.333 --> 52:18.935
to see who will be a Beastmaster tonight.

52:19.002 --> 52:21.738
Here's the situation going into Level 4...

52:21.805 --> 52:25.976
Clément Dumais, leading with 245 points,

52:26.042 --> 52:30.547
and Bin Xie, pulling up second
with 240 points.

52:30.614 --> 52:33.250
This is a very, very tight competition.

52:33.316 --> 52:37.154
The points are all cumulative,
so this will be an exciting finish,

52:37.220 --> 52:41.625
as they compete for $10,000
and the title of Beastmaster.

52:41.691 --> 52:42.759
Yeah!

52:45.762 --> 52:48.832
[Tiki] This is it.
We have reached Level 4.

52:48.899 --> 52:53.036
Two athletes, one winner.
$10,000 on the line.

52:53.470 --> 52:56.606
France's Clément Dumais
and China's Bin Xie

52:56.673 --> 52:58.842
have been battling it out all night.

52:59.276 --> 53:01.511
Bin is a former Special Forces soldier...

53:01.578 --> 53:02.779
[Chris and Tiki] Let it go.

53:02.846 --> 53:03.980
[Tiki] There he goes. Nice.

53:04.047 --> 53:05.715
[Tiki]...who has one target tonight...

53:06.449 --> 53:08.285
the title of "Beastmaster".

53:08.351 --> 53:12.189
He has more points,
but with his upper body strength,

53:12.255 --> 53:14.024
I don't think he'll make it through.

53:14.624 --> 53:16.793
[Tiki] Clément is a parkour instructor...

53:16.860 --> 53:18.461
[Tiki] There we go. He gets it.

53:18.528 --> 53:20.463
[Tiki] ...who climbed the Eiffel Tower.

53:20.530 --> 53:23.433
-Come on, Clément!
-Go, France!

53:23.500 --> 53:27.671
[Tiki] And he came out swinging,
taking first place on every level.

53:28.638 --> 53:31.808
But the Monkey King from China
has been right on his tail.

53:31.875 --> 53:34.077
[Clément] Like always,
he's always just behind me.

53:34.144 --> 53:37.447
It was ten points to start with.
Now, it's five so he's really close.

53:37.514 --> 53:39.849
It's a bit like the clash of the titans.

53:40.617 --> 53:43.320
[Tiki] And now,
with only a five-point difference,

53:43.386 --> 53:48.291
they begin the closest battle in the quest
to be crowned the next Beastmaster.

53:48.692 --> 53:52.495
Clément Dumais of France,
who comes in with 245 points,

53:52.562 --> 53:56.333
and Bin Xie of China with 240 points.

53:56.399 --> 53:58.568
[claxon sounds]

53:58.635 --> 54:00.070
[Tiki] And here they go.

54:00.136 --> 54:01.171
Come on.

54:01.238 --> 54:02.305
Go, Clément!

54:02.372 --> 54:04.007
Come on! Come, on!

54:06.042 --> 54:07.944
[Tiki] They're flying
up the Ricochet Wall.

54:08.011 --> 54:08.845
[Chris] Wow.

54:08.912 --> 54:11.982
[Tiki] These parkour and climbing skills
are serving them well.

54:12.048 --> 54:14.451
[Chris] This is unbelievable.
This is freaking close!

54:14.517 --> 54:15.819
[Tiki] Full Tilt.

54:18.989 --> 54:22.359
Those blocks tilt down
each time you put weight on them.

54:24.060 --> 54:26.763
The most important part
as they get to the Motherboard,

54:26.830 --> 54:30.600
is to be cautious,
as they've got eight pegs to climb.

54:30.667 --> 54:33.470
-Bin Xie is going for the point.
-[Chris] Bin Xie does it.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.672
Wow, that's devastating for "Clé-moon".

54:35.739 --> 54:39.009
[Tiki] Because only five points
separated them coming in.

54:39.442 --> 54:41.745
That puts Bin Xie in the lead.

54:43.280 --> 54:46.416
Bin Xie is struggling
a little bit to get started...

54:46.983 --> 54:48.151
on the Motherboard.

54:48.518 --> 54:52.122
Completely unconcerned about urgency.

54:52.188 --> 54:54.858
The first half of the Motherboard
is worth five points.

54:54.924 --> 54:57.894
If Clément can pass the orange line,
he can tie this--

54:57.961 --> 55:00.230
-What's wrong?
-I'm not sure what's happened.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.565
[Chris] Clément has tied it up.
Incredible.

55:03.466 --> 55:06.102
[Tiki] I'm not sure
what Bin Xie is up to.

55:06.169 --> 55:07.037
[Chris] Is he hurt?

55:07.103 --> 55:09.239
I don't know why he's not climbing, Tiki.

55:09.306 --> 55:12.309
-I don't understand Bin Xie.
-He's in neutral.

55:12.375 --> 55:14.811
What's wrong? What's wrong?

55:14.878 --> 55:17.981
[Tiki] I'm going to speculate
that he's resting his arms.

55:18.048 --> 55:22.552
Because we know fatigue ultimately takes
over when you do any climbing exercise.

55:22.619 --> 55:26.389
And it may prove to be true here,
as Clément Dumais is kind of stuck.

55:27.290 --> 55:29.759
[commentators] Oh!

55:30.260 --> 55:32.362
[Chris] And look.
This strategy kind of paid off.

55:32.429 --> 55:34.130
-He just fell off.
-[Tiki] Wow.

55:34.197 --> 55:38.268
He's not out of it yet, but he needs
to regroup and get back up there.

55:38.335 --> 55:40.870
[Chris] That was like a Tortoise
and the Hare kind of thing.

55:40.937 --> 55:43.740
[Tiki] It's totally
the Tortoise and the Hare.

55:43.807 --> 55:47.711
Bin Xie begins to climb the Motherboard.

55:47.777 --> 55:51.548
Clément Dumais has yet
to try to re-ascend Ricochet.

55:51.614 --> 55:54.918
Remember, he's got to go back across,
Full Tilt as well.

55:54.984 --> 55:57.987
[Chris] Oh, my God. I can't even think
about having to do all that.

55:58.054 --> 56:00.056
That's like going through school again,

56:00.123 --> 56:01.891
which was bad for me.

56:03.059 --> 56:06.029
And Bin Xie has crossed the orange line
to break the tie.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.833
[Tiki] This is coming down to strategy.

56:09.899 --> 56:12.068
It's not always about speed.

56:12.135 --> 56:14.237
Bin Xie just taught a lesson

56:14.704 --> 56:16.206
to Clément Dumais.

56:16.606 --> 56:18.908
Bin Xie, Navy Special Forces.

56:19.376 --> 56:22.879
It's psychological warfare
he's playing on Clément Dumais.

56:23.413 --> 56:27.617
-He can't lose by five points.
-Please, Clément.

56:27.684 --> 56:28.985
You have to win!

56:32.188 --> 56:35.291
[Tiki] Clément Dumais, down again.

56:35.925 --> 56:41.564
Bin Xie is just a few feet away
from getting to the top of Motherboard.

56:42.332 --> 56:43.166
[Chris] Wow.

56:43.833 --> 56:46.936
Come on, Clément!
What, are you taking a cigarette break?

56:47.570 --> 56:51.474
There are 30 seconds left
and Bin Xie is laying down.

56:52.409 --> 56:54.511
[Tiki] He was five points behind.

56:54.911 --> 56:57.547
The Monkey King is now ten points ahead.

56:57.614 --> 57:01.584
As long as Clément doesn't pass him,
he'll take the crown tonight.

57:01.851 --> 57:06.356
[Chris] Come on, Dumais. You get $10,000
if you win this thing. Hurry up!

57:08.091 --> 57:09.959
[chanting]

57:12.695 --> 57:16.800
[Chris and Tiki]
Five, four, three, two, one.

57:16.866 --> 57:18.401
[Tiki] And there it is!

57:20.236 --> 57:21.905
Bin Xie!

57:25.308 --> 57:30.480
Masterful strategy has claimed
the title of "Beastmaster".

57:30.547 --> 57:32.782
He'll go on to face the other winners

57:32.849 --> 57:37.253
for a chance to be crowned
the Ultimate Beastmaster.

57:38.555 --> 57:40.223
[Chris] Yeah, Bin Xie!

57:44.093 --> 57:46.629
It's so sad. I feel bad.

57:46.696 --> 57:52.769
Clément was first until right at the end,
and now China's ahead of France.

57:55.939 --> 57:57.707
[Tiki] Here's what's very interesting...

57:57.774 --> 58:00.043
You could see in Bin Xie's mind

58:00.109 --> 58:02.779
his urgency was not
to climb the Motherboard.

58:02.846 --> 58:05.648
His urgency was just
to get the Point Thruster.

58:05.715 --> 58:09.819
I'm really excited because I came here
just to earn the Beastmaster title.

58:09.886 --> 58:12.622
I can't wait to see who can top that.

58:12.689 --> 58:15.391
But the beauty of Netflix?
You don't have to wait.

58:15.458 --> 58:18.127
You can watch the entire season right now.

58:18.194 --> 58:22.966
108 incredible athletes,
but only one Ultimate Beastmaster.

58:23.032 --> 58:25.235
Also, zero commercials.

58:25.301 --> 58:27.871
I honestly feel like
we should get a medal for that.

58:27.937 --> 58:29.205
Go watch already.

58:33.276 --> 58:35.912
