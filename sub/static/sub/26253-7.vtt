[GROANS]

14:32.969 --> 14:35.259
<i>[COMPUTER VOICE] Ten minutes
to satellite re-entry.</i>

14:35.260 --> 14:37.129
What... What have you done?

14:37.130 --> 14:39.678
I've deactivated
one of your satellites.

14:39.679 --> 14:43.259
<i>When it falls out of orbit, the
impact will destroy your palace,</i>

14:43.260 --> 14:46.919

a new Wakanda will rise...</i>

14:46.920 --> 14:48.879
one led by me.

14:48.880 --> 14:52.994
If my father were alive, he would be
disgusted by what you have become!

14:53.536 --> 14:57.919
Hmm. T'Chaka was a great
man, a great king,

14:57.920 --> 15:01.838
but he failed our people
when he left his throne to you...

15:01.839 --> 15:06.009
a spoiled, pampered prince without the
strength to do what must be done!

15:06.010 --> 15:10.218
- And what is that?
- Rule! Wakanda is superior.

15:10.219 --> 15:13.009
Ours is the greatest nation
the world has ever known.

15:13.010 --> 15:17.178
The world will know it
when Wakanda conquers all!

15:17.179 --> 15:18.838
[YELLS]

15:18.839 --> 15:21.629
[SHURI] Open sockets
three, nine, and 24.

15:21.630 --> 15:25.009
I need those for direct access to the
kernel while I reset the beta node.

15:25.010 --> 15:27.088
Princess, may I help you?

15:27.089 --> 15:29.509
Yes. You may stop
distracting me.

15:29.510 --> 15:31.919
I am familiar
with the computer systems.

15:31.920 --> 15:33.880
- Surely there must be something...
- Dora Milaje,

15:33.883 --> 15:35.718
please take the Baron
to his quarters.

15:35.719 --> 15:38.799
What? I put my life
at risk for you,

15:38.800 --> 15:40.919
and yet you still see me
as an enemy?!

15:40.920 --> 15:43.419
I see you as an ally, truly,

15:43.420 --> 15:46.549
but this is a matter
of Wakandan security.

15:46.550 --> 15:50.009
You do not belong here.
Do you?

15:50.010 --> 15:52.049
I...
[EXHALES]

15:52.050 --> 15:54.430
will be in my suite.

15:54.889 --> 15:56.009
Let him go.

He knows the way.

It is over, T'Challa.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.309
Time for your final lesson.

16:22.310 --> 16:26.268
Perhaps. But you
are no longer my teacher.

[BOTH YELL]

16:27.769 --> 16:29.559
[BOTH GRUNTING]

16:29.560 --> 16:33.888
You have taught me everything you
know, but not everything I know.

16:33.889 --> 16:36.179
I have fought
with Captain America.

16:36.180 --> 16:38.388
[BOTH GRUNTING]

16:38.389 --> 16:40.019
I have fought with Black Widow.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.518
I have learned, I have adapted,

16:45.519 --> 16:48.268
while you, Killmonger... you...

[BOTH YELL]

[GRUNTS]

16:58.560 --> 17:02.018
Arrogant T'Challa.
Sloppy.

17:02.019 --> 17:06.769
So focused on beating me, you've
forgotten the true danger.

17:06.770 --> 17:08.638
- [BEEPING]
- <i>Five minutes to impact.</i>

17:08.642 --> 17:12.479
Your sister is alone,
defenseless.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.769
Without your help,
how ever will she prevail?

17:15.770 --> 17:18.269
You underestimate us both.

17:18.270 --> 17:21.599
Shuri is never defenseless.

17:22.929 --> 17:24.928
<i>I have repaired my comm system.</i>

17:24.929 --> 17:26.559
<i>Shuri, are you there?</i>

17:26.560 --> 17:28.387
T'Challa, did you find N'Jadaka?

17:28.388 --> 17:31.349
<i>He is no longer a factor.
What is your status?</i>

17:31.350 --> 17:34.178
We've nearly regained control
of the entire network.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.178
When were you going to tell me a
satellite is about to fall on us?

17:37.179 --> 17:39.519
<i>You have time to stop it,
but you must hurry.</i>

17:39.520 --> 17:41.849
Yes. Thank you,
King Obvious.

17:41.850 --> 17:44.179
We're working as fast as we can.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.020
- [BEEPS]
- Yes!

17:54.023 --> 17:56.638
Went back online.
Activate the plasma shields.

17:56.639 --> 17:59.179
[TRILLING]

18:09.520 --> 18:11.888
T'Challa,
we've got a big problem.

18:11.889 --> 18:14.269
Even with the plasma shields,
the satellite's impact

18:14.270 --> 18:16.519
will still flatten
a huge section of the city.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.519
The losses
would be catastrophic.

18:18.520 --> 18:21.660
<i>The satellite must be destroyed
before it strikes.</i>

18:22.060 --> 18:24.913
On it. Accessing the
self-destruct right... [PINGS]

18:24.914 --> 18:27.838
- No! No, no, no!
- <i>What is wrong?</i>

18:27.839 --> 18:30.259
The self-destruct command
has to come from the source

18:30.260 --> 18:32.679
where the go-signal originated...
the island.

18:32.680 --> 18:35.299
You have to initiate the
self-destruct sequence from there.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.049
I'm transmitting you
the stop code.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.800
- You have less than two minutes.

20:45.095 --> 20:46.878
Thank you, sister.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.724
I am coming home.

20:49.180 --> 20:52.549
[SHURI] Computer and defense systems
are secure and fully operational.

20:52.550 --> 20:55.680
[BEEPING] We've also revised and
updated all security protocols

20:55.683 --> 20:58.679
and shut down the backdoor
access that N'Jadaka used.

20:58.680 --> 21:01.259
He calls himself Killmonger now.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.009
And what do you mean "we"?

21:03.010 --> 21:05.338
Zemo proved himself
during the crisis.

21:05.339 --> 21:07.838
I've given him
limited computer access.

21:07.839 --> 21:09.628
Are you sure that is wise?

21:09.629 --> 21:12.088
He risked his life
for me, T'Challa.

21:12.089 --> 21:13.708
For all of us.

21:14.010 --> 21:17.418
Killmonger and the Shadow Council
are a threat unlike any other.

21:17.419 --> 21:18.970
- We need...
- Ah, stop.

21:18.973 --> 21:21.838
If you trust him, Shuri,
that is enough.

21:21.839 --> 21:23.549
Zemo is an ally.

21:23.550 --> 21:26.128
It's Killmonger
who wants your throne.

21:26.129 --> 21:28.259
He will never have it, sister.

21:28.260 --> 21:30.970
You can trust that too.
