00:16.625 --> 00:19.410
I don't care
if you're new to us.

00:20.629 --> 00:23.719
I don't care
what your past was.

00:23.762 --> 00:26.983
We all have a past.

00:27.027 --> 00:29.072
None of that matters now.

00:37.689 --> 00:41.302
You did well at the barn.

00:41.345 --> 00:43.956
Now I need something more.

00:45.175 --> 00:48.613
Eyes and ears
inside their walls.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.400
You are the kind of man
they'll trust.

00:52.443 --> 00:58.667
Practical, loyal, smart.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.237
And my daughter
doesn't know you.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.767
Where should I start?

01:11.810 --> 01:13.334
Ugh!

01:13.377 --> 01:18.730
Find some strangers
and join them.

01:30.525 --> 01:31.656
Help!

01:31.700 --> 01:33.615
-Come on! Let's move!
-Help me!

01:33.658 --> 01:35.356
-Walkers!
-Walkers! Move!

01:35.399 --> 01:36.226
Help me!

01:36.270 --> 01:38.228
-He's over here!
-Help me!

01:39.273 --> 01:40.970
Help me!

01:53.374 --> 01:55.027
Alpha:
Go to their gate.

01:56.594 --> 01:59.945
They won't turn you away.

02:01.077 --> 02:02.296
How you doing?

02:02.339 --> 02:03.993
Hey, roll your sleeve up
for me, please.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.299
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.604
There we go.

02:09.912 --> 02:13.045
Make them think
you're at home...

02:14.438 --> 02:17.006
...but never forget
your real one.

02:28.757 --> 02:35.242
Push quietly against their
weaknesses until they crumble.

03:05.228 --> 03:07.578
Alpha: Do all this,

03:07.622 --> 03:12.104
and we will welcome you home
when they fall.

03:12.148 --> 03:15.412
You'll have a special place
among us.

04:20.347 --> 04:21.565
Siddiq, are you awake?

04:23.785 --> 04:24.916
Hola.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.528
Bueno.

04:33.055 --> 04:34.012
Siddiq and I
were talking about

04:34.056 --> 04:36.188
how he's not sleeping much.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.238
We're having
a hot romance.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.196
Didn't you know?

04:46.460 --> 04:50.333
Nah, we were just hanging,
and he got called out.

04:50.377 --> 04:52.292
Something about, uh,

04:52.335 --> 04:55.817
Andy and Donna's kid
throwing up.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.384
I didn't ask
for details.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.343
Okay.

05:00.387 --> 05:02.563
Lo siento, pero
you just missed him.

05:03.912 --> 05:05.566
Mm.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.579
No.

05:18.622 --> 05:19.971
Rosita.

05:23.018 --> 05:24.715
Okay. Okay.
Okay.

05:24.759 --> 05:27.370
Okay. Okay.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.067
There you go.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.744
Alright. It's okay.
No.

05:53.788 --> 05:55.093
It's okay.
No.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.357
In nature, sometimes
parents eat their young.

06:07.584 --> 06:08.716
Ahh!

06:08.759 --> 06:12.067
No!

06:16.027 --> 06:17.028
No!

06:20.945 --> 06:22.338
Oh!

06:39.964 --> 06:42.010
It's okay. It's okay.

06:42.053 --> 06:43.925
It's okay. It's okay.

06:43.968 --> 06:45.448
It's okay. It's okay.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.407
It's okay.

06:47.450 --> 06:50.322
I know.

06:50.366 --> 06:51.802
I know.

07:57.389 --> 07:58.695
You alright?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.611
Is the baby still alive?

08:01.655 --> 08:04.527
The baby that was rescued
at Hilltop?

08:04.571 --> 08:06.311
Y-Yes.

08:07.182 --> 08:10.011
He's my nephew.

08:10.054 --> 08:12.100
Oh.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.232
I didn't know that.

08:18.149 --> 08:20.238
Did you ever name him?

08:20.282 --> 08:21.675
My sister didn't.

08:21.718 --> 08:23.459
She couldn't.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.548
The family raising himnamed him Adam.

08:25.592 --> 08:27.724
Can I see him?

08:28.682 --> 08:31.206
Your people
left him to die.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.469
Why would we ever agreeto that?

08:33.513 --> 08:35.689
Because we can trade.

08:35.732 --> 08:37.429
I have information
for you.

08:37.473 --> 08:38.430
What is it?

08:38.474 --> 08:39.736
Promise me I can see him.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.956
I can't promise you
anything.

08:41.999 --> 08:45.002
I'll listen to what you have,see if it's true,

08:45.046 --> 08:46.526
and then we can talk.

08:48.092 --> 08:50.573
He's the only family
I have left.

08:50.617 --> 08:52.749
Well, then,you better tell the truth.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.316
Without your mask.

09:10.941 --> 09:14.684
Before all this,
my name was Mary.

09:16.381 --> 09:18.601
Hi, Mary.

09:18.645 --> 09:20.821
What do you wanna tell me?

09:23.519 --> 09:24.694
Hope that hurts.

09:30.482 --> 09:32.572
It doesn't matter.

09:34.051 --> 09:36.140
None of this matters.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.447
Watch enough peopleget incinerated, devoured alive,

09:38.490 --> 09:41.624
you see how ridiculous it is
getting attached to ourselves.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.626
But knowing that
sets you free.

09:43.670 --> 09:44.801
Is that
what you're doing?

09:44.845 --> 09:46.107
Setting us free?

09:46.150 --> 09:48.762
If you learn that lesson,
it'll only help you.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.678
What, so we can be
more like you?

09:51.721 --> 09:54.028
Accept the future.Gabriel:Siddiq depended on you.

09:54.071 --> 09:56.073
Why put him throughall that hell in the barn

09:56.117 --> 09:57.335
just to kill him
months later?

09:57.379 --> 09:59.337
I-I can't see an ideologybehind that.

09:59.381 --> 10:01.383
I liked Siddiq.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.167
Oh, you liked him?

10:05.909 --> 10:07.781
He wasn't part
of the plan.

10:09.739 --> 10:12.133
But he found out who I was,
so I had no choice.

10:12.176 --> 10:13.656
What plan?

10:13.700 --> 10:16.790
Encourage your paranoia
about us...

10:16.833 --> 10:20.315
which will push you
into bad decisions.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.230
Places like this

10:22.273 --> 10:23.710
are cruel promises
to their people,

10:23.753 --> 10:26.800
and they crumble
at the smallest nick.

10:28.758 --> 10:30.847
Hell, I'm gonna enjoy watching
you rip each other apart

10:30.891 --> 10:32.109
over what to do with me.

10:32.153 --> 10:34.764
Just like with Negan.

10:34.808 --> 10:37.637
Is that what you want?A public reckoning?

10:37.680 --> 10:39.421
A chance to be heard?

10:39.464 --> 10:41.815
That's what you'll give me.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.077
Because it's right.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.689
We helped you.Why?

10:46.733 --> 10:48.865
'Cause you wanted
another doctor around?

10:48.909 --> 10:51.172
You got something
from me, too.

10:51.215 --> 10:52.695
Don't pretend you didn't.

10:55.045 --> 11:00.050
No one is actually kind.

11:00.094 --> 11:02.705
We are selfish.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.054
We are brutal.

11:04.098 --> 11:06.013
Come on.

11:06.056 --> 11:07.754
Even seeing all those heads
on spikes

11:07.797 --> 11:09.277
didn't teach you
what people are?

11:17.111 --> 11:19.853
He's been here
four months.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.683
How didn't I know?

11:26.120 --> 11:27.512
None of us did.

11:27.556 --> 11:29.863
We all ate together.

11:29.906 --> 11:32.692
Talked about
training the militia.

11:33.127 --> 11:36.913
He treated Gracie.

11:36.957 --> 11:38.785
You can't do that
to yourself.

11:38.828 --> 11:40.264
Yeah.
Especially now.

11:40.308 --> 11:41.396
We gotta keep our heads
straight,

11:41.439 --> 11:43.224
try to figure out
what's going on.

11:44.791 --> 11:50.448
Mary, the Whisperer
I've been talking to, um,

11:50.492 --> 11:52.712
told me where Alpha
is keeping the herd.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.325
Just over the border,
on their side.

11:57.368 --> 11:58.935
It's this sunken field

11:58.979 --> 12:00.676
on the edge
of the national forest.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.547
We can leave
right after the funeral.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.767
We're gonna trust
a Whisperer now?

12:04.811 --> 12:06.900
You wanna do nothing?Lydia's still gone.

12:06.943 --> 12:09.816
We don't even knowwhat that means yet.

12:09.859 --> 12:11.818
Alpha doesn't know that.

12:11.861 --> 12:14.864
With Dante locked up in a cell,
she never has to.

12:14.908 --> 12:17.867
We ain't gonna talk abouthow this is probably an ambush?

12:17.911 --> 12:22.785
Well, the baby
that Connie rescued --

12:22.829 --> 12:24.613
apparently
that's Mary's nephew.

12:24.656 --> 12:27.050
She wants to see him.

12:27.094 --> 12:28.095
I don't think she's lying.

12:28.138 --> 12:29.487
Alright.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.794
Get a group from Hilltopand meet us there.

12:31.838 --> 12:34.014
Second we're done, we're goinglooking for the girl.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.363
Yeah. I'll radio them.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.234
Maybe they can get the news
to Michonne, too.

12:37.278 --> 12:39.323
Alright.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.805
Hey.

12:42.849 --> 12:45.068
Why don't you stay here?I'll go.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.461
Why?

12:46.504 --> 12:49.116
You gonna tell mewhat really happened out there?

12:49.159 --> 12:51.945
I told you.
Lydia didn't want to come back.

12:51.988 --> 12:53.207
I couldn't make her.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.862
Her being here protects us.You know that.

12:55.905 --> 12:58.386
So, that's it for her now,
to be our shield?

12:58.429 --> 13:00.997
Just lock her up again?

13:01.041 --> 13:01.998
I showed
one of Alpha's people

13:02.042 --> 13:03.260
that their leader
lied to them,

13:03.304 --> 13:04.522
and that's good for us.

13:04.566 --> 13:06.829
We can push on
their wounds, too.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.788
You stillshould have told me.

13:08.831 --> 13:10.006
I'll help you look for her,

13:10.050 --> 13:11.834
but I don't think
she wants to be found.

13:11.878 --> 13:14.576
Are we talking about her,or are we talking about you?

13:30.461 --> 13:31.549
Whoa.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.986
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.959
What do you see?

13:50.003 --> 13:51.874
I'm not as good a trackeras Daryl,

13:51.918 --> 13:55.747
but those printslook recent and clean,

13:55.791 --> 13:57.575
not dragging
like a walker.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.795
Whisperers
don't travel alone,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.362
so it's gotta be
somebody else.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.886
Could beone of their scouts.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.105
The longer
we spend out here,

14:05.148 --> 14:08.238
the more likely we are
to bump into them.

14:08.282 --> 14:12.286
If it's just one scout,
I like our chances.

14:12.329 --> 14:18.118
But we have to be
as quiet as possible.

14:18.161 --> 14:19.902
Right?

14:19.946 --> 14:22.470
Yup, that was meant for me.Let's go.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.167
I take no offense.

14:24.211 --> 14:26.996
I am here as a representative
of Hilltop

14:27.040 --> 14:29.869
as a soldier of peace
and justice.

14:29.912 --> 14:32.088
Or you wanna see
Jules.

14:32.132 --> 14:32.959
What?

14:33.002 --> 14:35.091
Stop it.

14:35.135 --> 14:37.006
What were you whistlingbefore?

14:37.050 --> 14:39.922
I'm glad
you asked me that.

14:39.966 --> 14:42.925
I'm whistling one
of the most whistle-able --

14:42.969 --> 14:45.058
is that even a word? --
it is now --

14:45.101 --> 14:47.147
whistle-able sections

14:47.190 --> 14:50.933
of Rachmaninoff's variations
on a theme of Paganini.

14:50.977 --> 14:53.631
It's like one of the greatest
pieces of music ever.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.068
It's my favorite.

14:55.111 --> 14:59.202
And I can only hear it
in my head nowadays.

14:59.246 --> 15:02.162
I wanna write that down, butyou've gotta spell it, please.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.773
I got you.
What do you got here?

15:04.816 --> 15:06.514
A record of everythingthat happens to us.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.472
Our stories
for the future.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.431
Really?

15:10.474 --> 15:11.823
Oh.

15:11.867 --> 15:13.173
Well, maybe
I can help you out.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.957
If you wanna do
a great personal history,

15:15.001 --> 15:16.480
you've gotta read a little.

15:16.524 --> 15:22.225
And this road leads right
through Waterford, right?

15:22.269 --> 15:24.575
And I remember they had a
really excellent library there.

15:24.619 --> 15:27.622
Maybe we want to stop
and pick up some inspiration.

15:27.665 --> 15:29.189
What do you say, Ma?

15:29.232 --> 15:30.712
We really shouldn't.

15:30.755 --> 15:33.062
Come on, please, Mom?

15:33.106 --> 15:35.717
I've read almost every bookin Alexandria.

16:03.136 --> 16:06.008
Russian-English dictionary
for Eugene.

16:06.052 --> 16:07.009
Satellite parts.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.056
Okay, smart one.

16:10.099 --> 16:12.014
I'm gonna go check out
their music section.

16:12.058 --> 16:16.149
Just 'cause, you know,
we're here.

16:17.454 --> 16:20.153
I'll go see if there's
anything worth taking.

16:33.296 --> 16:34.994
Mm.

16:40.173 --> 16:41.826
I always wanted
to read this.

16:43.872 --> 16:45.352
Maybe we can read ittogether?

16:45.395 --> 16:47.528
Magna: Hilltop to Michonne.

16:47.571 --> 16:49.051
Are you there?

16:51.271 --> 16:52.272
This is Michonne.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.664
It's Magna.

16:53.708 --> 16:57.233
I'm relaying a message to you
from Alexandria.

16:57.277 --> 16:59.583
Michonne and Judith
are listening.

16:59.627 --> 17:01.020
What happened?

17:12.379 --> 17:15.164
Aha, yes!

17:20.343 --> 17:21.692
Yo.

17:21.736 --> 17:23.172
Yo.

17:23.216 --> 17:26.132
Here we go.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.612
Ahh!

17:42.887 --> 17:44.759
Ohh!

17:52.897 --> 17:54.682
Oh!

17:54.725 --> 17:55.813
Damn it!

17:57.859 --> 17:59.426
Help!

18:04.605 --> 18:07.521
Hey!
W-What's your name, man?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.305
Huh? What's your name?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.306
What -- Wait!

18:10.350 --> 18:13.396
Thank you! Ah!

18:18.923 --> 18:20.490
Hey!

18:20.534 --> 18:23.058
What's your name, man?!What happened?

18:23.102 --> 18:24.364
This guy just came in
out of nowhere.

18:24.407 --> 18:26.409
He saved my life.
He just ran out!

18:26.453 --> 18:28.107
Who the hell does that?!

18:28.150 --> 18:31.458
Maybe you can catch him.
Ohh!

18:33.199 --> 18:37.159
Who in the hell
does that, man?

18:37.203 --> 18:39.466
And leave
all his stuff here?

18:39.509 --> 18:41.642
Just runs off?

18:41.685 --> 18:42.904
What the hell?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.906
That's a good book.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.603
You should keep that one.

18:46.647 --> 18:49.171
We'll take all of it.

18:49.215 --> 18:50.825
Hey, I'm sorry.

18:50.868 --> 18:52.870
Is everything alright?

18:59.007 --> 19:00.226
Siddiq is dead.

19:00.269 --> 19:02.402
So, no,
not everything is okay.

19:02.445 --> 19:05.492
We have to get to Oceanside
and get back home now.

19:16.242 --> 19:18.940
I remember this passage
from my studies.

19:18.983 --> 19:20.376
Written by a scholar
centuries ago

19:20.420 --> 19:24.989
who was trying to understand
the impossible --

19:25.033 --> 19:29.168
"Let me live
if life is better for me

19:29.211 --> 19:33.476
and take my life
if death is better for me."

19:33.520 --> 19:35.348
He had surrendered himself
to fate

19:35.391 --> 19:38.220
because his world
defied logic.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.744
Defied justice.

19:50.580 --> 19:52.060
We created you from it...

19:54.018 --> 19:56.412
...and return you into it...

19:57.761 --> 20:02.113
...and from it we will
raise you a second time.

20:42.458 --> 20:44.330
Hi.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114
Hi.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.463
It's good to see you.

20:47.507 --> 20:51.162
You too.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.516
I can't believe
he's gone.

20:56.559 --> 20:58.387
I don't know why, but...

20:59.997 --> 21:02.478
Never mind.

21:02.522 --> 21:03.958
What?

21:04.001 --> 21:07.353
He was one of those peopleI thought would live forever.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.140
Not really, but you know.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.188
Too many things
are changing.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.931
How long are you staying?

21:20.975 --> 21:23.586
Maybe a day or two.

21:23.630 --> 21:26.241
I'm sorry.
I wish I had more time.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.330
It's okay.

21:29.505 --> 21:31.594
I hear you might have foundAlpha's herd.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.423
You need help?

21:34.467 --> 21:36.338
No, we have
enough people.

21:39.385 --> 21:42.344
Everything else okay?

21:46.566 --> 21:49.220
Good luck.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.311
Thanks.

22:41.316 --> 22:42.796
No!

23:00.640 --> 23:03.120
Ohh!

23:12.782 --> 23:15.176
Thanks.

23:15.219 --> 23:18.484
No expressions of
gratitude required.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.095
I was only relieved I happened
to be crossing through

23:21.138 --> 23:22.705
on my way ho--

23:24.054 --> 23:26.187
On my way back
to my domicile.

23:27.188 --> 23:30.539
You almost said "home."

23:30.583 --> 23:31.627
No.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.327
Yes.

23:38.721 --> 23:42.595
My deepest condolences,
Rosita.

23:42.638 --> 23:45.685
Siddiq's passing was
an incomprehensible tragedy.

23:46.947 --> 23:47.991
I only wish there was
more I could offer

23:48.035 --> 23:49.079
than to pay my respects

23:49.123 --> 23:50.646
and to bash

23:50.690 --> 23:53.388
a few vexatious walkers

23:53.432 --> 23:54.824
in their
flame-blistered crania.

23:56.652 --> 23:59.612
Well...

23:59.655 --> 24:02.484
travel safe.

24:02.528 --> 24:06.880
I mean, I'm -- I'm the one
who's gonna be traveling.

24:15.671 --> 24:17.107
Man: Who were you before?

24:17.151 --> 24:21.242
I was a doctor, a father.

24:21.285 --> 24:23.636
I was trying to get by.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.556
How long did you know
the people you came in with?

24:30.599 --> 24:32.035
Months, I don't know.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.733
I lost track of time.

24:33.776 --> 24:34.864
They saved my life.

24:34.908 --> 24:37.345
I was dying
out in the woods.

24:37.388 --> 24:38.912
Who was your leader?

24:38.955 --> 24:40.566
We didn't --

24:40.609 --> 24:43.743
How many people
have you killed?

24:43.786 --> 24:47.486
Only man I ever killed
tried to hurt my son.

24:47.529 --> 24:50.619
But walkers got Jimmy
in the end, anyway.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.599
What happened?

25:13.642 --> 25:18.560
I was helping Eugenewith some walkers at the gates.

25:18.604 --> 25:19.779
How's sweet pea?

25:19.822 --> 25:22.521
Fast asleep.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.875
You know,that wasn't the truth.

25:28.918 --> 25:31.225
Um...

25:31.268 --> 25:32.618
I wasn't helping Eugene.

25:32.661 --> 25:35.011
He was helping me.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.970
Okay.
I just --

25:37.013 --> 25:41.452
I should be ableto handle walkers like that.

25:41.496 --> 25:42.671
I always could before.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.456
It's been a rough day,
Rosita.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.806
No, it's not that.

25:50.461 --> 25:52.246
I could die.

25:54.988 --> 25:57.817
I used to think that,if it happened, it happened.

26:00.733 --> 26:03.170
But now that wouldmake Coco an orphan.

26:07.348 --> 26:09.785
And I cannot die.

26:13.484 --> 26:14.703
I'm afraid.

26:14.747 --> 26:17.053
And that feeling
isn't going away.

26:17.097 --> 26:19.621
Well feelings don't predict
the future.

26:19.665 --> 26:21.928
That sounds like a quotefrom somewhere else.

26:21.971 --> 26:23.886
We need to focus
on the problem in front of us.

26:23.930 --> 26:25.192
It's my responsibility to --

26:25.235 --> 26:26.497
If I freeze again --

26:26.541 --> 26:28.064
You won't.

26:28.108 --> 26:29.631
You're not listening.

26:29.675 --> 26:31.807
I have to figure out
how this happened to us.

26:31.851 --> 26:33.809
Council members are talking
to Jen and Wayne now,

26:33.853 --> 26:35.724
and I need to get over there.
We need to find Lydia.

26:35.768 --> 26:37.944
We need to find out
why she didn't know Dante.

26:37.987 --> 26:39.685
We need to find out --Did you hear what I said?

26:39.728 --> 26:41.861
You needed help
with a walker,

26:41.904 --> 26:42.992
and now you think
you'll keep needing help,

26:43.036 --> 26:45.299
but I'm saying
the feeling will pass.

26:52.741 --> 26:55.265
Maybe Dante was rightabout us.

26:58.007 --> 27:00.488
We're not as strong
as we think we are.

27:07.060 --> 27:09.671
Alright. If you get
two more right, you win.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.587
Pick easy ones.No way, Jose.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.198
Okay, let's see. Uh.

27:15.242 --> 27:17.287
Capital of Missouri.

27:17.331 --> 27:19.420
Jefferson City.

27:19.463 --> 27:20.377
Amazing.

27:20.421 --> 27:21.814
Uh...

27:21.857 --> 27:22.858
capital
of South Dakota.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.077
Pierre.

27:24.120 --> 27:27.646
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.821
That's amazing.

27:28.864 --> 27:29.996
It's good.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.040
Okay. Choose.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.520
I want a story
about California.

27:32.563 --> 27:34.914
Capital, Sacramento.

27:34.957 --> 27:36.524
California.

27:36.567 --> 27:37.525
Okay.

27:37.568 --> 27:39.919
Let's see.

27:39.962 --> 27:43.923
Okay, um,
summer after college,

27:43.966 --> 27:45.707
I was hiking near Eureka

27:45.751 --> 27:47.970
with this man
I was in love with.

27:48.014 --> 27:49.755
And we were way high up
in the forest.

27:49.798 --> 27:54.716
We found these old ruins
from a Native American village

27:54.760 --> 27:56.892
from hundreds of years ago.

27:56.936 --> 28:01.549
And we stood there
in the middle of the village

28:01.592 --> 28:04.073
and just listened to the sound
of the ocean waves

28:04.117 --> 28:06.902
crashing on the beach
from far away.

28:06.946 --> 28:08.861
And we tried to imagine,
you know,

28:08.904 --> 28:10.819
what those people
were like

28:10.863 --> 28:15.911
who were now, um,
um, lost to time.

28:15.955 --> 28:20.220
These were people who had
their own laws and beliefs

28:20.263 --> 28:23.876
and hopes for the future
of their own village.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.619
You know, I was one
of the very first people

28:28.663 --> 28:30.578
here in Alexandria,

28:30.621 --> 28:33.755
back when it started,
back when we --

28:33.799 --> 28:36.976
we thought we knew
what it was going to be.

28:38.368 --> 28:41.763
And recently, I've been
thinking more and more

28:41.807 --> 28:42.721
about that village.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.027
What happened
to those people?

28:45.071 --> 28:48.465
I don't know.

28:59.999 --> 29:01.783
Michonne: When was the last timeyou had new people in here?

29:01.827 --> 29:03.132
Rachel:
Since way before the fire.

29:03.176 --> 29:07.441
Dante showed up in Alexandriaway before the fire.

29:07.484 --> 29:08.790
We can't use that
as a marker

29:08.834 --> 29:11.532
of Alpha's return anymore.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.751
Whatever process
you were using

29:12.794 --> 29:13.969
to vetyour newest people here,

29:14.013 --> 29:15.492
you have to put themthrough a different one.

29:15.536 --> 29:18.060
Man: Ahh! No! No!

29:20.019 --> 29:22.848
-What's going on?
-Aah! No! No!

29:22.891 --> 29:24.980
N-No! No!

29:25.024 --> 29:26.416
How did you get in here?

29:26.460 --> 29:27.940
-Come on, come on!

29:27.983 --> 29:30.812
-Who the hell are you?
-He was trying to steal a sail.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.771
And then probably
also a boat.

29:32.814 --> 29:34.990
Let me go!Where did you come from?

29:35.034 --> 29:37.819
Let me go.
Don't touch me!

29:37.863 --> 29:40.169
I swear to God,I'm not gonna ask you again.

29:42.955 --> 29:46.828
I'm just trying
to get home.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.396
I don't want to cause
any trouble.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.877
I just wanna get back
to my family.

29:51.920 --> 29:56.055
Michonne...This is the guy.
This is the guy.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.883
He saved my life at the library.How you doing, pal?

29:57.926 --> 29:59.493
And also the guy that's beensneaking around,

29:59.536 --> 30:00.929
messing withthe security system.

30:00.973 --> 30:03.845
In the past, we've hung men
for less than that.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.456
And he might be
a Whisperer.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.894
O-Okay. H-Hold on.
Hold on. Hold on.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.722
He was taking books.

30:11.766 --> 30:13.986
He -- He has a pictureof his family.

30:14.029 --> 30:15.988
He's got a bag full of stuff.Does that seem like a Whisperer?

30:16.031 --> 30:18.251
We don't know what a Whisperer
looks like anymore, Luke.

30:18.294 --> 30:21.080
Come on.
Let me go.

30:21.123 --> 30:25.258
You're gonna answer
our questions.

30:25.301 --> 30:27.651
Who are your people?

30:29.915 --> 30:31.917
Cyndie:
They breached the fence!

30:31.960 --> 30:33.092
Hold him!

30:35.007 --> 30:36.922
Watch their hands!

30:53.634 --> 30:55.897
Judith!

31:16.309 --> 31:18.964
Did you even have a son?

31:21.096 --> 31:22.968
Why does that matter?

31:24.795 --> 31:27.320
I guess it doesn't.

31:27.363 --> 31:30.062
It was one of the things
I liked about you.

31:33.804 --> 31:36.677
That my son was killed?

31:36.720 --> 31:37.896
That you had a family.

31:40.289 --> 31:43.379
I suppose you'd like me to
never trust anyone ever again.

31:46.992 --> 31:49.951
It's a meaningless idea.

32:14.628 --> 32:17.936
Is that what you're here
to show us?

32:17.979 --> 32:20.895
Look around you, Gabriel.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.941
Look what people didto the world.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.858
And you think
we can be good?

32:27.902 --> 32:30.687
You think we deservea second chance?

32:31.775 --> 32:34.082
I loved Siddiq
like a brother.

32:36.128 --> 32:39.087
My family will never be
the same now.

32:39.131 --> 32:41.046
His daughter
will never know him.

32:42.221 --> 32:44.701
Maybe Rosita will blame me,
and maybe she's right to.

32:44.745 --> 32:46.051
I didn't protect them
enough.

32:46.094 --> 32:49.228
I...

32:49.271 --> 32:50.969
I haven't always
been brave.

32:57.932 --> 33:00.195
Do we deserve
a second chance?

33:03.242 --> 33:05.157
I don't know.

33:07.072 --> 33:09.074
But sometimes we get one,
anyway.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.390
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

33:21.434 --> 33:24.785
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

33:24.828 --> 33:26.569
Ahh!

34:12.050 --> 34:15.314
No! No!

34:18.230 --> 34:19.579
Ohh!

34:21.059 --> 34:24.410
Don't move.

34:33.375 --> 34:34.507
Mom!

34:34.550 --> 34:36.335
Over here!

34:47.346 --> 34:48.999
Good girl.

34:56.137 --> 34:59.097
You will grow tall,

34:59.140 --> 35:01.316
and you will
grow strong.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.364
You will know safety...

35:06.800 --> 35:08.280
...and family...

35:08.323 --> 35:10.151
and home.

35:46.318 --> 35:49.973
-Hi.
-Hey, D.

35:51.236 --> 35:53.803
-Good to see you.
-You too.

35:53.847 --> 35:55.805
-Good to see you.
-Mm.

35:55.849 --> 35:59.331
How's Rosita?
As expected.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.508
Let's get to it.
Screw these freaks.

36:03.944 --> 36:06.120
I say that
in Siddiq's honor.

36:08.035 --> 36:10.168
Thanks for helping.

37:12.099 --> 37:14.710
Hey. Wait.

37:16.190 --> 37:18.279
Coulda lost a foot.

37:18.323 --> 37:20.847
They laid traps.Means we're getting closer.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.805
I saw something over there.

37:22.849 --> 37:24.981
Will you stop this shit?

37:25.025 --> 37:26.287
Please.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.464
You want her dead so bad,

37:29.508 --> 37:31.205
you don't even care
what happens to you.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.381
That's not true.

37:33.425 --> 37:36.515
You never
came off that boat.

37:36.558 --> 37:39.431
It's been like talking
to a goddamn ghost.

37:42.172 --> 37:44.174
I'm doing the best I can.

37:44.218 --> 37:47.090
I'm the one you tell.

37:47.134 --> 37:48.527
Me.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.837
I don't -- I don't know how.

37:54.881 --> 37:58.972
You gotta try, alright?

38:02.149 --> 38:03.193
Come here.

38:13.378 --> 38:14.553
She's not worth it.

38:18.252 --> 38:19.688
She's not.

38:19.732 --> 38:21.603
Look at me.

38:23.126 --> 38:27.043
She's a dead woman,
anyway.

38:27.087 --> 38:29.045
We have a future.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.960
Don't let her
take that, too.

38:34.529 --> 38:36.009
Yes.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.492
You good?

38:42.537 --> 38:44.147
Yeah.

38:48.891 --> 38:51.024
Alright.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.505
I'll get this.

40:20.505 --> 40:22.594
Don't go through my stuff.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.641
That book belongs
to my daughter.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.513
I wasn't.

40:28.556 --> 40:30.558
The book fell out,
and I picked it up for you.

40:30.602 --> 40:32.473
And it clearly belongs
to the library.

40:32.517 --> 40:37.043
It's for my daughter.

40:37.086 --> 40:38.218
Put it back.

40:45.312 --> 40:46.487
Be careful.

40:46.531 --> 40:49.577
You'll rip
your stitches.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.843
You comfortable?

40:58.717 --> 40:59.979
Judith...

41:00.022 --> 41:02.242
give us a minute.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.393
So...

41:23.437 --> 41:25.395
what are you
really doing here?

41:30.618 --> 41:32.838
Your daughter's a little demonwith a sword.

41:32.881 --> 41:34.143
Yeah.

41:34.187 --> 41:37.669
Like mother,
like daughter.

41:37.712 --> 41:40.541
Only mine wouldn't leave
anything to heal.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.720
Now answer
my damn question.

41:46.765 --> 41:50.333
Didn't mean it
in a bad way.

41:50.377 --> 41:52.727
No way you make it
this long

41:52.771 --> 41:56.252
without being comfortablewith violence.

41:56.296 --> 42:00.430
Now, how long
have you been watching us?

42:00.474 --> 42:02.128
I'm not watching you.

42:02.171 --> 42:04.347
I don't want to hurtanybody here.

42:06.393 --> 42:09.614
I left home for supplies,

42:09.657 --> 42:11.703
and now I'm just tryingto get back.

42:11.746 --> 42:13.400
I swear.

42:13.443 --> 42:16.664
Why'd you help
my friend?

42:16.708 --> 42:18.231
Is that
a part of the play?

42:18.274 --> 42:20.842
No. No.
There is no play.

42:25.499 --> 42:27.980
I don't know.
I just did it.

42:31.026 --> 42:32.462
He needed help.

42:33.812 --> 42:38.643
Even with what might happento me here, glad I did it.

42:41.602 --> 42:45.650
Mercy's in short supplythese days.

42:48.174 --> 42:49.784
I don't expect it.

42:49.828 --> 42:51.438
Maybe I don't deserve it.

42:58.010 --> 43:01.056
Something wrong?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.406
You just reminded me
of something

43:03.450 --> 43:05.626
a friend of mine
used to say.

43:09.151 --> 43:11.501
What's that?

43:15.593 --> 43:18.900
"My mercy prevails
over my wrath."

43:45.797 --> 43:48.364
Okay.

43:49.627 --> 43:51.454
So, you're trying
to get home.

43:56.372 --> 43:58.723
Just tell me
where that is.

43:58.766 --> 44:02.378
I can't tell you
where I live.

44:02.422 --> 44:03.684
My family's there.

44:03.728 --> 44:06.252
This is how you get
back to them.

44:06.295 --> 44:09.037
Or keep them safe.

44:09.081 --> 44:12.867
Your wife and kids
don't know where you are

44:12.911 --> 44:15.522
or whether you're
ever gonna come back.

44:15.565 --> 44:18.133
Don't put them
through that.

44:25.706 --> 44:29.492
I live on Bloodsworth Islandin Tangier Sound.

44:31.756 --> 44:34.672
Hard to find...

44:34.715 --> 44:36.238
and fortified.

44:39.720 --> 44:43.245
Like I said, I didn't meanto break in, cause any chaos,

44:43.289 --> 44:46.031
but I needed a boat
on your pier.

44:48.773 --> 44:51.819
Well,
good intentions or not,

44:51.863 --> 44:54.779
you owe them
for all that damage,

44:54.822 --> 44:57.738
and you're not going anywhere
until we figure that out.

44:57.782 --> 45:00.393
You have enemies to fight.

45:03.048 --> 45:06.094
Maybe we can help
each other out.

45:08.096 --> 45:10.403
What do you mean?

45:20.282 --> 45:21.893
What'd he tell you?

45:22.981 --> 45:26.419
He lives on a naval base,

45:26.462 --> 45:28.334
an island about
two days from here.

45:29.988 --> 45:34.688
Could be weapons big enoughto kill a herd.

45:34.732 --> 45:37.865
Take out Alpha
once and for all.

45:37.909 --> 45:39.214
And he'd just
let you have 'em?

45:39.258 --> 45:41.869
Oh, yeah.

45:41.913 --> 45:45.003
Then I need to find a wayto bring them back.

45:47.832 --> 45:50.530
So, what's wrong?

45:50.573 --> 45:53.838
It would have to be me...

45:53.881 --> 45:57.232
just metaking that kind of risk.

45:59.452 --> 46:02.281
But also...

46:02.324 --> 46:04.936
I should get back.

46:04.979 --> 46:07.329
With everything happeningat home, we should be together.

46:07.373 --> 46:08.940
Fighting together.

46:13.901 --> 46:17.165
But this
could end the war.

46:17.209 --> 46:19.037
Right?

46:19.080 --> 46:21.343
Maybe.

46:24.912 --> 46:26.479
I have to find out.

46:30.831 --> 46:33.660
It's okay, Mom.

46:33.703 --> 46:35.227
You do.

46:39.884 --> 46:42.147
We can't lose anyone else.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.266
God damn it!

47:14.309 --> 47:16.094
-Wait.
-For what?

47:16.137 --> 47:17.530
Aaron: This doesn't mean
Mary lied to us, alright?

47:17.573 --> 47:19.140
They were protecting
this place.

47:19.184 --> 47:20.881
T-They put a trap in the road
as a deterrent.

47:20.925 --> 47:22.100
Yeah, from some huntera decade ago.

47:22.143 --> 47:23.275
No. That thing was rigged

47:23.318 --> 47:25.103
more recently than that,
and you know it.

47:25.146 --> 47:27.192
You wanna stand aroundand figure it out?

47:27.235 --> 47:31.849
Look, the herd could have been
here last week or yesterday.

47:31.892 --> 47:33.676
We had an obligation
to come check this out.

47:33.720 --> 47:36.201
Nah.
Time to find Lydia.

47:36.244 --> 47:38.029
Let's go.

47:43.208 --> 47:45.906
I know everything's
upside down right now,

47:45.950 --> 47:48.691
but I wasn't wrong
about this.

48:09.364 --> 48:12.063
I negotiated
with Rachel.

48:12.106 --> 48:14.935
Whatever weapons you have
on your island

48:14.979 --> 48:17.285
will pay off your debt.

48:17.329 --> 48:18.852
I'll take you home,

48:18.896 --> 48:20.288
and I'll bring the boat
back to them.

48:26.338 --> 48:28.557
Can't be that simple.

48:28.601 --> 48:30.995
Or thank you.

48:31.038 --> 48:33.301
You're welcome.

48:33.345 --> 48:34.781
Up to you.

48:36.652 --> 48:38.089
Can I have my stuff back?

49:02.678 --> 49:04.245
I'm Virgil.

49:07.248 --> 49:08.989
Michonne.

49:09.033 --> 49:10.121
Man:
Yeah, we're gonna need...

49:10.164 --> 49:11.949
Fill everyone in
back home.

49:11.992 --> 49:15.778
I am just a walkie call away
if they need anything.

49:15.822 --> 49:17.998
I'm only a couple days
behind you.

49:18.042 --> 49:19.217
I'll make sure
the council knows

49:19.260 --> 49:21.219
what you're about to
bring home.

49:21.262 --> 49:23.699
We'll have people ready
with wagons, if you need.

49:23.743 --> 49:25.049
Just keep us posted.

49:25.092 --> 49:27.573
Michonne,I don't want you to worry.

49:27.616 --> 49:29.140
We got Judith
looking after us.

49:33.927 --> 49:35.189
Keep her safe.

49:35.233 --> 49:37.191
I will.

49:43.371 --> 49:46.809
Now, it doesn't have to be
an emergency

49:46.853 --> 49:49.464
for you to check in,
okay?

49:49.508 --> 49:51.162
You can do that every day.

49:53.425 --> 49:54.513
Or...

49:56.428 --> 49:58.821
...every hour.

50:00.127 --> 50:02.521
Roger.
Over and out.

50:06.873 --> 50:08.396
I'll see you soon.

50:11.051 --> 50:14.185
Be good for Uncle Daryl.

50:48.523 --> 50:51.222
Daryl: Lydia would have taken
this river downstream.

50:51.265 --> 50:52.875
Back to our side.

50:55.878 --> 50:58.316
Hey.

50:58.359 --> 50:59.839
Carol, let's go.

50:59.882 --> 51:01.188
You go on.
I'll meet you.

51:01.232 --> 51:03.495
Nope.
We all stay together.

51:25.386 --> 51:26.344
Hey!

51:28.302 --> 51:30.348
Carol!

52:20.311 --> 52:21.747
Go! Get her ass
out of there!

53:14.060 --> 53:16.323
Carol!
