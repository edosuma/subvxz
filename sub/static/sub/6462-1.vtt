01:18.348 --> 01:19.839
The mission of the Vegas PD...

01:20.117 --> 01:23.178
is to protect the community
through prevention,

01:23.253 --> 01:26.655
partnership and professional
service.

01:32.295 --> 01:34.321
The acronym "I CARE" is
the guiding principle...

01:34.397 --> 01:38.425
for each and every Vegas PD
employee.

01:38.502 --> 01:39.800
This acronym represents the
values...

01:39.870 --> 01:42.339
of the Las Vegas
Police Department:

01:42.606 --> 01:47.408
Integrity, Courage,
Accountability...

01:47.477 --> 01:49.275
Respect for People.

01:54.151 --> 01:56.279
The values are supported
by behaviors demonstrated by...

01:56.353 --> 02:00.381
the actions of employees as they
live these values.

02:00.457 --> 02:02.323
All employees are expected to
represent the values...

02:02.392 --> 02:06.887
of the Department while in the
workplace and off-duty.

02:07.164 --> 02:09.565
This is Vegas PD's oath.

02:16.706 --> 02:21.909
I hate this. I hate my job.
I hate what I've become.

02:29.586 --> 02:31.748
Who are you?

02:51.575 --> 02:52.440
Hi, Jack.

02:52.509 --> 02:53.772
Angela.

02:53.843 --> 02:55.436
So where's the boss at?

02:55.512 --> 02:58.481
Where do you think? In the
office.

02:58.547 --> 02:59.776
Right. Thanks.

02:59.848 --> 03:01.874
Hey, you coming with to
Red Herring tonight?

03:01.951 --> 03:03.544
Yeah, I'll be there.

03:03.619 --> 03:06.680
Nice. I'll get dressed.

03:09.458 --> 03:10.756
...and just make
sure the transfer goes through...

03:10.826 --> 03:12.385
first thing in the
morning. Go ahead and...

03:12.461 --> 03:14.692
email that confirmation to my
cell.

03:14.763 --> 03:16.231
Ok.

03:18.500 --> 03:19.627
Hey! Jack!

03:19.702 --> 03:21.466
Roy. What's going on?

03:21.537 --> 03:24.507
Ah, just making a
killing as usual. Have a seat.

03:25.407 --> 03:26.568
Hi, Jack.

03:26.642 --> 03:27.940
Hey, Kim.

03:28.010 --> 03:29.535
Are you here
to take me on that date?

03:29.612 --> 03:33.606
Ah, not tonight, darlin'.
Got business with the boss.

03:34.250 --> 03:37.310
Look, we need to talk about
something... in private.

04:00.509 --> 04:01.442
Hey, do you think
it's a good idea...

04:01.510 --> 04:02.808
for you guys to be
drinking together?

04:02.878 --> 04:05.347
No, but I need to see him though.

04:05.414 --> 04:06.905
Hey hey hey,
my man!

04:06.982 --> 04:09.383
Roy Ridell! Smooth as ever.

04:09.451 --> 04:11.886
Lookin' sharp, man!
Have a seat.

04:13.022 --> 04:14.888
What the fuck is he doing
here?

04:14.957 --> 04:16.425
C'mon, Damon, look. He's only
here to-

04:16.492 --> 04:18.552
- I've been waiting to talk
to you for five years.

04:18.627 --> 04:21.995
Yeah? Well, you know what I've
been doing for five years?

04:22.064 --> 04:23.464
Waitin' to settle a score.

04:23.532 --> 04:24.465
Don't start.

04:24.533 --> 04:25.466
Yeah? Don't make me.

04:25.534 --> 04:27.332
Okay look. Knock it off. Just
be the bigger man...

04:27.403 --> 04:29.031
Both of you.

04:29.772 --> 04:31.297
Hey stranger.

04:31.373 --> 04:33.535
Angela, lookin' beautiful as
ever.

04:33.609 --> 04:34.736
You too, handsome.

04:34.810 --> 04:36.711
You still playin' for the right
team?

04:36.779 --> 04:38.509
Care to find out?

04:38.881 --> 04:42.283
I can't. It's official - I
belong to Roy now.

04:44.053 --> 04:45.681
Lucky devil.

04:45.954 --> 04:46.683
] Hey, sweetie.

04:46.755 --> 04:48.280
Hey, Jack.

04:48.357 --> 04:49.450
] Damon?

04:49.525 --> 04:50.857
] Vodka.

04:50.926 --> 04:52.622
] Cristal, please.

04:52.695 --> 04:54.288
Jack and Coke.

04:54.363 --> 04:55.661
] White Russian.

05:00.803 --> 05:02.738
Wait here.

05:05.107 --> 05:06.803
You son of a bitch!

05:06.875 --> 05:08.707
the missing link.

05:08.777 --> 05:10.405
You bring a whole new meaning to
the term...

05:10.479 --> 05:11.742
"killing off the competition. "

05:11.814 --> 05:12.611
] What are you talking
about?

05:12.681 --> 05:14.047
Wilkinson.

05:14.116 --> 05:15.379
What, did you guys break up?

05:15.451 --> 05:16.749
Why the fuck did you
kill Wilkinson?!

05:16.819 --> 05:20.415
Whoa whoa whoa, guys, this
is not the time, nor the place.

05:20.489 --> 05:21.422
And who the fuck are
you?

05:21.490 --> 05:23.789
I'm the guy with the gun...
and the right to use it.

05:23.859 --> 05:24.827
Are you threatening to
shoot me?

05:24.893 --> 05:26.691
No, no, no. He's just
trying to remind you...

05:26.762 --> 05:27.752
that all the swearing and
threatening...

05:27.830 --> 05:30.595
in the world won't close a
nine-millimeter hole.

05:30.666 --> 05:31.827
Is this what you wanted to
talk to me about?

05:31.900 --> 05:34.699
You should have
been a detective yourself.

05:34.770 --> 05:36.762
Now I'll be the first
to admit...

05:36.839 --> 05:39.331
Wilkinson had more enemies than
you.

05:39.408 --> 05:41.343
But you're the only one
in town.

05:42.544 --> 05:43.409
Alright, when was he killed?

05:43.479 --> 05:44.344
Last night.

05:44.413 --> 05:44.946
Last night?

05:44.947 --> 05:46.609
Yes.

05:46.682 --> 05:49.982
Honey, where was I last
night?

05:50.052 --> 05:53.921
You were on a phone call
til about 10, making slow,

05:53.989 --> 05:57.926
passionate love to me til
about midnight...

05:57.993 --> 06:00.622
and then experimenting with
some light S&M until 2.

06:00.696 --> 06:02.824
Ooh. That's my boy.

06:02.898 --> 06:05.424
I've got the hot wax burns to
prove it.

06:05.501 --> 06:06.696
Listen, Kyusovich.

06:06.769 --> 06:08.670
Aren't you tired of trying to
ruin my life by now?

06:08.737 --> 06:10.865
I mean now you're trying to pin
a murder rap on me?

06:10.939 --> 06:12.839
How do I know you didn't do
it yourself?

06:15.710 --> 06:19.477
He was a bastard, but
he was my friend.

06:19.547 --> 06:23.382
And friends don't screw each
other, Roy.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.647
Ooh, imagine that, Jack.

06:26.521 --> 06:28.581
And who the fuck are
you?

06:29.023 --> 06:30.924
I'm his brother.

06:31.192 --> 06:34.026
I don't have to listen to this.
But you hear me now...

06:34.095 --> 06:35.996
- That is not the White
Russian I ordered.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.497
What did you say, mother fucker?

06:37.565 --> 06:39.761
What did you say?

06:46.507 --> 06:49.909
Be careful, Kyusovich...
that could have been you.

06:51.112 --> 06:52.671
Get up.

07:03.191 --> 07:04.784
] Let's go.

07:11.065 --> 07:12.795
] What the hell was that?

07:12.867 --> 07:14.426
] Predicting the weather.

07:14.802 --> 07:15.701
] You know, someday Damon
and I...

07:15.770 --> 07:18.569
aren't going to be here
to protect your dumb ass.

07:21.075 --> 07:23.670
Mouth, muscles, and morals.

07:23.744 --> 07:26.839
It's good to have the old gang
back together again.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.911
That's the thing about Vegas...

07:29.984 --> 07:32.215
you never really know who you
think you know.

07:53.741 --> 07:57.200
Detective Adamson?
I'm Mason White, LAPD.

07:57.278 --> 07:59.509
See anything you like?

08:01.282 --> 08:03.547
I've been assigned the
Wilkinson case.

08:03.618 --> 08:04.916
Why?

08:04.986 --> 08:06.955
It bears some resemblance to a
couple of cases I worked...

08:07.021 --> 08:08.717
a few years ago.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.724
Hm. So you think it's a
serial?

08:10.791 --> 08:14.785
It's a possibility. But, let's
see what you've got first.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.489
Hey, Boss? Sorry for
interrupting, but Captain wants

08:17.565 --> 08:18.298
to see you.

08:18.299 --> 08:19.065
Thanks, hon.

08:19.066 --> 08:21.865
Oh, and, she's down at
City Hall.

08:21.936 --> 08:27.034
Huh, really? Hm.

08:30.845 --> 08:34.509
Adamson, I want
you to work this case with White.

08:34.582 --> 08:35.674
No.

08:35.750 --> 08:36.474
No?

08:36.551 --> 08:39.111
I have to recuse myself.
Conflict of interest.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.849
Sorry, Jack. This is direct from
the Mayor.

08:41.923 --> 08:43.948
Begging your pardon, sir,
but what business

08:44.025 --> 08:44.993
is this of yours?

08:45.059 --> 08:47.688
Oh, I understand that
Mr. Ridell is considering a run for the

08:47.762 --> 08:50.197
governor's seat. If he's
involved in a murder,

08:50.264 --> 08:51.960
I need to know about it.

08:52.033 --> 08:54.696
And, Detective...
The fact is, it's my business...

08:54.769 --> 08:56.567
and no one else's business.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.629
Mr. Mayor, I'm best friends
with the man fingers are

08:58.706 --> 08:59.537
starting to point at.

08:59.607 --> 09:04.011
You can handle it. And you can
do it quickly and quietly.

09:04.078 --> 09:05.171
The press is gonna be all
over us.

09:05.246 --> 09:10.082
I don't have time for this!
Just show White around town.

09:18.726 --> 09:20.058
Is the
forensics report in here?

09:20.127 --> 09:23.222
Yeah, 38. Nothing special
about it. Wilkinson took it in

09:23.297 --> 09:25.198
the head from about
10 feet away.

09:25.266 --> 09:28.997
No fingerprints. No
forced entry.

09:32.639 --> 09:35.108
It says we got the call at
3:40 yesterday afternoon.

09:35.175 --> 09:36.768
That's right.

09:36.843 --> 09:37.867
Why so long?

09:37.944 --> 09:41.972
Well, he lived alone. The maid
didn't show up til around 3:30.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.778
I'm surprised none of his
neighbors heard the shot.

09:43.850 --> 09:47.946
No, three heard it, but
assumed it was outside.

09:48.622 --> 09:50.215
Any theories?

09:50.290 --> 09:54.591
Come on... I know you have
at least one.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.688
Wilkinson had someone over
for drinks.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.631
Later that evening, somebody
breaks in, Wilkinson startles

09:59.699 --> 10:04.364
him. Perp takes a shot,
goes for the loot.

10:31.998 --> 10:35.696
Look, this guy had enemies.

10:35.769 --> 10:39.865
Other than your friend Ridell?

10:40.440 --> 10:41.874
What do you know about Roy?

10:41.941 --> 10:43.933
Let's just say "cut-throat
business sensibilities" will

10:44.010 --> 10:48.209
earn you a reputation.

10:55.822 --> 10:59.657
The police... Now
what the fuck is he doing here?

10:59.726 --> 11:00.955
Observing.

11:01.027 --> 11:04.657
He can't be involved.
He's friends with the killer.

11:04.731 --> 11:07.792
No suspects have been named
yet. But Detective Adamson is

11:07.867 --> 11:09.165
the best investigator in Vegas,

11:09.235 --> 11:11.795
So if you want your
friend's murder solved, you'll

11:11.871 --> 11:14.841
do whatever he asks you to.

11:14.908 --> 11:19.278
Okay. Come on in, gentlemens.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.356
] What, exactly, was your
relationship with the deceased,

11:29.422 --> 11:30.446
Mr. Kissavich?

11:30.724 --> 11:32.750
It's Kyusovich.

11:32.826 --> 11:33.816
Sure.

11:33.893 --> 11:35.759
Look what Detective White
means is that we're more

11:35.829 --> 11:38.094
concerned in solving a crime
than pronouncing

11:38.164 --> 11:40.998
names correctly.

11:41.267 --> 11:44.260
We've been worked
together for about six years.

11:44.337 --> 11:46.101
What's your business?

11:46.172 --> 11:47.105
Investments.

11:47.173 --> 11:48.937
Care to elaborate?

11:49.008 --> 11:52.069
No. I don't.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.272
Okay.

11:53.346 --> 11:58.375
Then why do you think Mr.
Ridell killed Mr. Wilkinson?

11:59.385 --> 12:03.117
Well, we knew Roy was
involved on his trip to Russia.

12:03.189 --> 12:05.021
There were six of us on the
project.

12:05.091 --> 12:08.027
Roy and his partner had
developed security system for

12:08.094 --> 12:10.893
Russian M.R.I. processing
company or something.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.365
And Roy had to leave
under hurried circumstances.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.129
What does this have to do
with Wilkinson?

12:15.201 --> 12:18.968
Let's just say... Roy wasn't
named there as a suspect either.

12:19.038 --> 12:21.803
You said there were six of
you. Who were the others?

12:21.875 --> 12:24.811
Chaise, Quarrie and Sukay.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.109
Do you think we might be
able to contact them?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.274
I'm sure Chaise and
Quarrie will want to talk to

12:29.349 --> 12:31.978
you. I'll get you their numbers.

12:32.051 --> 12:33.451
Why wouldn't Sukay want to talk
to us?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.512
Go and ask Roy.

12:35.789 --> 12:39.055
Boy, I wish everyone was as
cooperative as you are.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.185
Look, last night you said
Wilkinson had more enemies than

12:41.261 --> 12:43.252
Ridell. Who are they?

12:43.328 --> 12:46.025
Doesn't matter. Roy did it.

12:46.398 --> 12:47.098
Ok.

12:47.099 --> 12:48.795
Are you done here?

12:48.867 --> 12:52.065
Just one more question, Mr.
Kyusovich.

12:52.137 --> 12:54.936
Yes, Detective?

12:55.007 --> 12:58.409
Where were you on the night
of the murder?

12:58.477 --> 13:00.309
Look if you want me to start
working with you, we've got to

13:00.379 --> 13:03.213
start sharing more information.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.409
Agreed.

13:05.484 --> 13:07.510
Let's start with why
you're here.

13:08.887 --> 13:11.254
Look, I'll tell you everything
when we have more time.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.316
But this case is already 36
hours old and getting stale, so

13:14.393 --> 13:17.022
let's just concentrate on that.

13:17.095 --> 13:20.554
Okay. We know Roy was
working with the group.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.166
They didn't get along, and he
has something to hide.

13:23.235 --> 13:25.227
That presents motive.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.331
Maybe. But he also has an alibi.

13:28.407 --> 13:30.967
] Yeah, but so does
Kyusovich.

13:31.043 --> 13:35.174
I don't think he did it. I
think someone else is involved.

13:35.247 --> 13:38.445
Well, why don't we go talk
to Roy?

13:38.517 --> 13:42.181
Because Roy is flying to SoCal
on business.

13:42.254 --> 13:44.917
He'll be back tomorrow.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.153
Okay.

13:48.227 --> 13:50.992
I'm telling you, Captain, he's
not the right guy for the case.

13:51.063 --> 13:52.588
And who is?

13:52.865 --> 13:53.531
I don't know.

13:53.532 --> 13:55.000
Yes, you do.

13:55.067 --> 13:56.933
Captain, his bias is the
opposite of mine,

13:57.002 --> 13:58.334
but just as strong.

13:58.403 --> 14:03.068
Listen... just keep an eye on
him. Help when necessary.

14:03.141 --> 14:06.373
Stay out of the
way when the fit hits the shan.

14:06.445 --> 14:09.210
You can keep your name off the
paperwork. I don't want this in

14:09.281 --> 14:10.909
the news any more than you do.

14:10.983 --> 14:13.475
I'm telling you, this is a
bad idea.

14:13.552 --> 14:16.078
White will bring in the
shooter. You'll just happen to

14:16.154 --> 14:19.556
be along when he does.
Comprende?

14:47.920 --> 14:53.384
] Who's here?
Chaise? Quarrie?

15:47.312 --> 15:49.508
Ooh! Man.

15:49.581 --> 15:50.640
Eh, it's office...

15:50.716 --> 15:53.379
Hey, so what are you doing
here?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.647
Thought you could use a lift.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.154
] Gee, thanks, but Angela's
waiting outside.

15:57.221 --> 15:59.452
Nah. She had a manicure
emergency... asked if

15:59.523 --> 16:00.320
I'd pick you up.

16:00.391 --> 16:02.724
Oh, really. I'm surprised she
didn't ask you for a police

16:02.994 --> 16:03.984
escort to the spa.

16:04.061 --> 16:05.723
What makes you think
she didn't?

16:05.997 --> 16:11.197
So what's going on?

16:11.268 --> 16:13.100
Where were you last night?

16:13.170 --> 16:14.001
What?

16:14.071 --> 16:17.508
Roy, I'm on the clock here.
C'mon, man. Where were you?

16:17.575 --> 16:20.204
I was in San Diego.

16:20.277 --> 16:22.143
Do you have witnesses who
can testify to that?

16:22.213 --> 16:23.579
Well, yes, of course. I was
meeting with Tactara and

16:23.647 --> 16:25.240
the Isaac Org.

16:25.316 --> 16:27.478
What did you do?

16:27.551 --> 16:30.419
Well, we had dinner at 7:30.
We had drinks from about

16:30.488 --> 16:32.081
10 til 2. Hey, I've got the bar
tabs to prove it.

16:32.156 --> 16:36.355
No... What did you discuss?

16:36.527 --> 16:39.554
Investments.

16:41.732 --> 16:44.759
Alright, look. I'm gonna
need their numbers.

16:45.036 --> 16:46.299
Well, come on, Jack. If you
call them, they're going to

16:46.370 --> 16:47.429
think I'm involved
with something.

16:47.505 --> 16:48.495
] Are you?
] Am I what?

16:48.572 --> 16:50.632
Involved with something. You
haven't even asked

16:50.708 --> 16:52.768
what's happened.

16:53.210 --> 16:55.611
Ok, what's happened?

16:56.047 --> 16:57.606
Kyusovich died last night.

16:57.681 --> 16:59.149
Was he murdered?

16:59.216 --> 17:01.310
I don't know... was he?

17:01.385 --> 17:03.354
Ah. Okay, Jack, come on.

17:03.421 --> 17:06.185
You basically threaten to
kill the guy, and 24 hours later

17:06.257 --> 17:07.486
he ends up dead?

17:07.558 --> 17:10.153
That automatically makes you
a suspect, Roy. And you haven't

17:10.227 --> 17:13.391
even asked how he died.

17:14.397 --> 17:17.527
How'd he die?

17:21.439 --> 17:23.101
Okay, so you say it was
an accident.

17:23.174 --> 17:25.473
It's within the realm of
possibility, but I really don't

17:25.542 --> 17:26.076
think so.

17:26.077 --> 17:27.409
Well, then someone is setting
me up.

17:27.478 --> 17:29.504
And who do you think that is?

17:29.580 --> 17:31.105
Damon.

17:31.182 --> 17:31.648
Roy.

17:31.649 --> 17:32.742
I don't know.

17:32.817 --> 17:34.479
What's going on?

17:34.552 --> 17:36.180
Kyusovich bought it.

17:36.253 --> 17:40.486
The White Russian's dead?
Too bad... I really had fun

17:40.558 --> 17:41.324
playing with that guy.

17:41.325 --> 17:44.261
Look, who else would want
Wilkinson and Kyusovich dead?

17:44.328 --> 17:48.197
You haven't met Chaise and
Quarrie yet, have you?

17:49.166 --> 17:51.465
Chaise and Quarrie...
weren't they friends of him? I

17:51.535 --> 17:55.165
mean, they wouldn't try to kill
their own friends, would they?

17:55.239 --> 17:57.674
I could think of a scenario.
You see...

17:57.741 --> 18:00.472
Quarrie always tried to be a
better businessman than me and

18:00.544 --> 18:01.111
he always failed...

18:01.112 --> 18:04.776
So maybe he's trying to be a
better thug than Kyusovich...

18:04.849 --> 18:08.251
And maybe his jealousy
finally got the best of him.

18:08.319 --> 18:09.480
Then why would they set you
up for it?

18:09.553 --> 18:11.488
See that's just
it... they wouldn't...

18:11.555 --> 18:13.524
'Cause they depend on me.
Besides, if they were

18:13.591 --> 18:15.492
committing murder when I'm not
even in town, then how can you

18:15.559 --> 18:17.528
call that a set up?

18:18.629 --> 18:21.656
Something's not right.

18:21.732 --> 18:26.295
Oop. Excuse me for a
minute, gentlemen.

18:28.405 --> 18:30.431
Hey, does
Angela know I'm a suspect?

18:30.508 --> 18:32.204
No. I haven't told her
anything.

18:32.276 --> 18:33.801
Good. I had gotten
her way too involved with

18:33.878 --> 18:36.279
those guys before.

18:36.881 --> 18:39.350
Understood.

18:43.287 --> 18:44.311
Who was that?

18:44.388 --> 18:44.821
Who?

18:44.822 --> 18:46.484
That guy you
went back there to talk to.

18:46.557 --> 18:47.320
Just had to make a call.

18:47.391 --> 18:50.225
Yeah, but...

19:08.646 --> 19:12.480
Looks like lunch is on me.

19:12.549 --> 19:13.744
How was your trip?

19:13.816 --> 19:17.514
Oh, it was okay.

19:17.854 --> 19:19.823
Baby, what's wrong?

19:19.889 --> 19:23.223
Kyusovich is dead.

19:23.293 --> 19:25.592
House fire.

19:25.662 --> 19:27.688
Honey, you shouldn't feel bad.

19:27.764 --> 19:30.700
I don't. I'm glad those
bastards are dead.

19:30.767 --> 19:32.861
But I am confused.

19:32.936 --> 19:35.428
I think someone's trying to
set me up.

19:35.505 --> 19:36.632
Who?

19:36.706 --> 19:40.666
I haven't quite figured that
out yet.

19:41.311 --> 19:42.643
] Have you given any
more thought to it?

19:42.712 --> 19:45.773
To what, baby?

19:45.915 --> 19:48.248
Oh. Leaving?

19:48.318 --> 19:52.414
Yeah. Let's just go. Let's
move to the islands. We've made

19:52.488 --> 19:55.424
enough. We can start fresh.

19:55.491 --> 19:58.950
Up until this week, we've had
such a great thing going here.

19:59.229 --> 20:01.892
Why would you want to walk away
from that?

20:01.965 --> 20:04.833
You call paying them
$10,000 a month "a great thing?"

20:04.901 --> 20:07.530
Ange, that's a small price to
pay for happiness.

20:07.604 --> 20:11.302
And you and I... we're happy.

20:11.374 --> 20:15.869
Which is a lot more than I
can say for most people.

20:17.847 --> 20:20.544
I don't know. I just have
a bad feeling about this...

20:22.252 --> 20:25.518
Baby, if someone's pulling
strings to get you, whoever it

20:25.588 --> 20:30.322
is probably won't stop until
they've really gotten to you.

20:30.393 --> 20:35.764
Don't worry about me. I'll be
fine. Come here.

20:54.350 --> 20:57.252
We know you killed
Wilkinson and Kyusovich.

20:58.655 --> 21:02.615
No, I didn't.

21:43.766 --> 21:46.668
Roy's talking tough, but
I've seen him like this before

21:46.736 --> 21:49.069
it's his way of bluffing.

21:49.739 --> 21:51.435
You will let me know when you've
got something, won't you?

21:51.507 --> 21:54.739
Of course, Captain.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.373
Captain.

21:59.449 --> 22:00.940
Yeah?

22:01.017 --> 22:03.646
Thanks for putting me on this
case.

22:03.720 --> 22:07.885
Don't make me regret it, Jack.

22:20.136 --> 22:21.866
But I am glad you're getting
along with Jack.

22:21.938 --> 22:23.930
Don't remind me of that.
Please.

22:24.006 --> 22:25.838
Come on, Damon, he was just
doing his job.

22:25.908 --> 22:29.435
He didn't have to do anything.
He could have "lost" some

22:29.511 --> 22:30.303
of the evidence.

22:30.379 --> 22:32.678
If he had "lost" some evidence,
he'd be in a cell right next to

22:32.748 --> 22:34.717
you right now.

22:35.550 --> 22:38.748
Yeah. He is a good cop,
isn't he?

22:38.820 --> 22:41.915
He's an honest cop. And you
should be thankful that he got

22:41.990 --> 22:43.083
you out early.

22:43.158 --> 22:44.023
He did?

22:44.092 --> 22:49.463
Yeah. Pulled a few strings
with the parole board. But he

22:49.531 --> 22:50.931
promised them that you were done
with the life.

22:50.999 --> 22:53.833
Hey, a man's gotta make a
living.

22:53.902 --> 22:56.133
Is Damon
really Roy's brother?

22:56.405 --> 22:59.569
Yeah. Roy's parents adopted
him when they were kids. I sent

22:59.641 --> 23:01.940
him up a few years ago.

23:02.010 --> 23:04.138
Shouldn't he be trying to
kill you instead of them?

23:04.413 --> 23:06.939
Well, Roy and I are best
friends. Been that way for

23:07.015 --> 23:12.477
years. As long as I stay that
way, he won't touch me.

23:12.554 --> 23:14.022
What's his connection?

23:14.089 --> 23:15.853
] I don't know if there
is one.

23:15.924 --> 23:17.449
] Hm.

23:17.526 --> 23:21.429
But I'm hesitant to put him
into this... mix.

23:28.470 --> 23:30.166
There's got to be someone else.

23:30.439 --> 23:36.140
Hm. So, what are you
thinkin?

23:40.215 --> 23:44.084
] It's possible. Wouldn't
be the first time.

23:44.152 --> 23:45.984
Alright, assuming a
professional is involved,

23:46.054 --> 23:48.717
everyone's alibis would be
negated.

23:48.790 --> 23:51.021
I mean for all we know, Roy
could have been in Borneo and

23:51.092 --> 23:52.560
paid someone to do it.

23:52.627 --> 23:55.426
Hm. So we check some
bank accounts.

23:55.497 --> 23:57.056
Exactly.

24:03.805 --> 24:07.003
Okay, here we go.

24:07.075 --> 24:09.442
Great. Alright, look I need
a list of all transfers,

24:09.511 --> 24:13.778
withdrawals and purchases over,
say... say, $5,000.

24:13.882 --> 24:16.477
Piece o' cake.

24:16.551 --> 24:19.020
I really appreciate this,
Kimmy.

24:19.087 --> 24:21.579
] Remember, I never did
this for you.

24:21.656 --> 24:24.717
] Same goes double for
you. I was never here, okay?

24:24.793 --> 24:28.787
See? You and I are on the
same wavelength. Isn't it great

24:28.864 --> 24:29.923
how well we communicate?

24:29.998 --> 24:31.899
] Kimmy...

24:35.670 --> 24:37.104
Hey, Jack. What do you got?

24:37.172 --> 24:39.539
Alright, we've got
a monthly withdrawal marked

24:39.608 --> 24:42.737
"Miscellaneous" for $10,000 a
month every month for the last

24:42.811 --> 24:44.677
three years.

24:44.746 --> 24:46.715
Wow. That's
pretty significant.

24:46.781 --> 24:48.511
Yeah, well, what's
significant is that there are 3

24:48.583 --> 24:50.176
new ones within the last month.

24:50.252 --> 24:52.687
The first transfer is about
2 weeks prior to Wilkinson's

24:52.754 --> 24:55.053
death. The second one's in
between Wilkinson and

24:55.123 --> 24:57.991
Kyusovich.
And you ready for this?

24:58.059 --> 25:00.255
The most recent was yesterday.

25:00.529 --> 25:01.963
Well, I'd say that's enough
evidence to make him

25:02.030 --> 25:05.262
our prime suspect.

25:06.067 --> 25:09.504
Agreed. Agreed. Look, we
need to get units on Chaise and

25:09.571 --> 25:11.938
Quarrie A.S.A.F.P.

25:12.674 --> 25:16.133
Done. Chaise called and
said he had something for us.

25:16.211 --> 25:19.113
I already dispatched units
on both of them - you know,

25:19.180 --> 25:22.173
thought we might get lucky.
Also got a warrant to hack

25:22.250 --> 25:24.151
through Ridell's firewall.

25:24.219 --> 25:26.916
Ha ha. Yeah, good luck
with that.

25:26.988 --> 25:28.854
You've got a better chance
of finding Bin Laden than you do

25:28.924 --> 25:31.052
of hacking into Roy's system.

25:31.126 --> 25:33.960
Look, I'll catch up with
you later.

25:40.802 --> 25:41.770
Hey, Jack.

25:41.836 --> 25:43.667
Damon, we need to talk.

25:43.737 --> 25:45.205
Hold up. Hey, Jack, I want
you to meet, uh -

25:45.272 --> 25:46.205
Charlie.

25:46.273 --> 25:47.741
Hi, Charlie.

25:47.808 --> 25:52.109
] Outside. Now.

25:52.179 --> 25:56.048
Alright. I'll be back.
Don't go nowhere.

25:56.116 --> 25:59.746
Okay. Look, I did some
digging.

25:59.820 --> 26:02.153
With whom?

26:02.222 --> 26:06.922
There's this guy. I don't
know his name. He's a broker.

26:06.994 --> 26:10.726
Ok, look. Let me explain it. The
employer finds the broker.

26:10.798 --> 26:13.165
The brokers hires the
Blue Screen.

26:13.233 --> 26:16.567
The employer and the Blue
Screen never ever meet.

26:16.637 --> 26:18.105
Alright, what the hell's a
Blue Screen?

26:18.172 --> 26:20.004
] He's a guy that wipes
your hard drive clean,

26:20.074 --> 26:22.737
so to speak.

26:22.810 --> 26:24.142
They call him the
Blue Screen of Death.

26:24.211 --> 26:28.171
That's cute. Look, what else
can you tell me about him?

26:28.248 --> 26:30.217
That's it. That's all I know.

26:30.284 --> 26:31.308
] You sure?

26:31.385 --> 26:35.186
I swear. C'mon man. Don't
look at me like that.

26:35.255 --> 26:37.121
Look, I'm on your side, Jack.

26:37.191 --> 26:39.922
Thanks.

26:48.369 --> 26:50.702
Get off of me!

27:03.651 --> 27:06.917
Get down! Get down!

27:06.987 --> 27:09.752
] Shoot him! What are
you waiting for?

27:09.823 --> 27:12.315
Shoot the motherfucker!

27:14.795 --> 27:17.856
] Get down!

27:20.300 --> 27:21.928
] What are you
waiting for?

27:45.459 --> 27:48.156
Sit down.

27:50.064 --> 27:51.191
] Hey.

27:51.265 --> 27:54.292
Hey. You ever heard of the
Blue Screen of Death?

27:54.368 --> 27:56.064
] What, like when your PC
crashes?

27:56.136 --> 27:58.833
Nah. Never mind.

27:58.906 --> 28:00.204
] Alright. I'm on my way
to Chaise's place.

28:00.274 --> 28:04.837
Yeah, I'm going to go talk
to Quarrie. I'll meet you there.

28:05.813 --> 28:08.305
I'm sorry, Mr. Quarrie.
Your membership was based upon

28:08.382 --> 28:11.875
Mr. Kyusovich's sponsorship.
Since his membership has been

28:11.952 --> 28:15.787
revoked, you are no longer
authorized to enter.

28:15.856 --> 28:19.122
Sam, it's alright. I'm inviting
him in as my guest tonight.

28:19.193 --> 28:21.890
Why thank you,
sir. Let me buy a drink.

28:21.962 --> 28:25.865
Much obliged.

28:25.933 --> 28:30.029
It's just not fair. I'm a
respectable businessman.

28:30.104 --> 28:31.299
I deserve respect.

28:31.371 --> 28:33.169
I hear you, pal.

28:33.240 --> 28:37.177
My family deserves to
live well. So do I.

28:37.244 --> 28:41.477
No foolin'! I didn't know
you were a family man.

28:45.753 --> 28:50.885
That's my brat kids...
God bless 'em.

28:50.958 --> 28:54.395
Hey, man, you live very
well. Good lookin' family.

28:54.461 --> 28:57.898
I suppose.

29:01.067 --> 29:05.266
Thanks, sweetheart.

29:06.205 --> 29:08.265
What is it you do again?

29:08.341 --> 29:11.334
Life insurance.

29:16.282 --> 29:20.083
That's funny. Someone's
trying to kill me.

29:20.153 --> 29:21.052
No...

29:21.120 --> 29:24.454
Yes! He wants to destroy
everything I've worked for.

29:24.524 --> 29:26.755
He wants revenge.

29:26.826 --> 29:28.761
Why would he want to do that?

29:31.063 --> 29:33.157
You promise not to tell
anyone?

29:33.232 --> 29:37.135
Scout's honor.

29:37.837 --> 29:40.204
I've been blackmailing him.

29:40.273 --> 29:45.941
What? Isn't that illegal?
C'mon, what do you have on him?

29:47.013 --> 29:50.848
He murdered someone...

29:51.918 --> 29:57.325
No, wait, that was
someone else.

29:59.392 --> 30:02.089
Can't the police protect
you?

30:02.161 --> 30:06.394
The police. You know, if
the police were to offer me

30:06.465 --> 30:11.566
protre... protection, I wouldn't
take it.

30:14.841 --> 30:17.003
I wouldn't want to
subject my family to that.

30:17.076 --> 30:22.849
I don't want them live in fear.
Besides, if this guy

30:25.918 --> 30:31.156
can get to Kyusovich,
he can get to me.

30:35.161 --> 30:39.963
C'mon, buddy. How bout I take
you home, huh?

30:44.537 --> 30:46.563
Relax, Rookie. We're just gonna
hang back until Adamson

30:46.639 --> 30:50.167
gets here.

31:18.271 --> 31:20.172
So, what's the news, guys?

31:20.239 --> 31:22.308
All's quiet.

31:23.009 --> 31:26.070
Oh, c'mon!

31:46.599 --> 31:50.627
Stop! This is the police!
We'll shoot!

32:00.513 --> 32:02.948
] Come on!

32:05.017 --> 32:06.178
Don't give us an excuse,
asshole.

32:06.252 --> 32:11.190
This guy ain't giving us any
excuses at all.

32:13.092 --> 32:17.187
Yeah, well, I... I
wasn't... I never even shot...

32:17.262 --> 32:18.127
Don't worry about it.

32:18.196 --> 32:19.061
] Look, we both saw what
happened...

32:19.130 --> 32:21.531
Everything was by the book.

32:22.300 --> 32:23.000
] Just fired.

32:23.001 --> 32:26.233
Yeah.

32:26.504 --> 32:27.938
What the hell was that?

32:28.006 --> 32:29.634
What was what?

32:29.708 --> 32:30.437
Let's go!

32:30.508 --> 32:33.410
You stay here! Call it in!

33:17.522 --> 33:19.718
] Stop the car!
Let me see your hands!

33:19.791 --> 33:21.316
Hands! Let me see em!

33:21.393 --> 33:25.125
Hands Up! Let me see em!

33:33.671 --> 33:36.197
I hate my job.

33:41.079 --> 33:43.242
] Sorry.

33:43.782 --> 33:47.150
So this is where you come
to unwind, huh?

33:47.218 --> 33:49.380
Yeah.

33:49.454 --> 33:53.221
Nice.

33:54.159 --> 33:56.424
You know we did volunteer
for this.

33:56.494 --> 33:58.190
Yeah.

33:58.263 --> 34:00.664
And we can quit at any time.

34:00.732 --> 34:03.133
Yeah.

34:03.201 --> 34:07.229
But there's no one else to
do it.

34:07.305 --> 34:10.139
Yeah.

34:11.176 --> 34:14.043
Look, Jack, about why I'm
here...

34:14.112 --> 34:17.411
I started a file on Ridell
about four years ago.

34:17.482 --> 34:19.678
Two C.E.O.'s he was
competing against met with,

34:19.751 --> 34:23.449
shall we say...
"untimely deaths. "

34:23.521 --> 34:26.389
So what makes you think Roy
was involved?

34:27.324 --> 34:33.255
Those 2 deaths cleared the
way for Ridell's early success.

34:37.768 --> 34:40.431
I can't believe he didn't
tell me about this.

34:40.505 --> 34:43.134
We had to close the case
for political reasons.

34:43.208 --> 34:43.934
Really.

34:44.109 --> 34:46.840
I've been watching Ridell
and his associates, just waiting

34:47.112 --> 34:49.638
for them to come back
up on the radar.

34:49.714 --> 34:52.775
Why don't you email me them
case files. I'll look over 'em,

34:52.851 --> 34:56.447
see what I can get out of Roy.
Roy and I owe each other our

34:56.521 --> 34:59.514
lives, but that doesn't put him
above the law.

35:00.258 --> 35:02.727
Wow.

35:05.730 --> 35:08.700
Why are you so hell-bent on
getting Roy?

35:08.867 --> 35:10.802
He's the one that got away
with it.

35:10.869 --> 35:14.169
I always know when they're
guilty, and I hate to see a

35:14.239 --> 35:16.538
guilty man walk free.

35:16.608 --> 35:20.375
Well, if fate isn't
tickling my tatas tonight!

35:23.414 --> 35:25.383
So you gonna say I can't buy
you that drink now?

35:25.450 --> 35:28.113
Have a seat.

35:29.286 --> 35:31.619
I don't eat dark Chocolate.

35:31.688 --> 35:36.183
] Why? It's rich and
goes down so easy.

35:42.232 --> 35:43.700
] Entertain the ladies
for a moment.

35:43.767 --> 35:46.134
] It's gonna take longer
than a moment.

35:46.503 --> 35:48.631
You know the rules, Saffiote.

35:48.705 --> 35:51.174
Hey, Jack, we make the rules.

35:51.241 --> 35:53.267
Yeah, well, you're not
supposed to contact me here,

35:53.343 --> 35:54.709
Even if it's a matter of
life and death.

35:54.778 --> 35:58.442
With you it's always a
matter of life and death.

35:58.515 --> 36:01.679
We came by to, uh, congratulate
you on such a great job

36:01.752 --> 36:02.451
you did tonight.

36:02.452 --> 36:05.718
What?! A rookie cop kills an
innocent man?

36:05.789 --> 36:07.781
That kid has to live with
that for the rest of his life.

36:07.858 --> 36:09.918
Well it wasn't my idea...
Jack-off.

36:10.194 --> 36:10.760
You son of a...

36:10.761 --> 36:12.696
Whoa, Jack. Take it easy.

36:12.763 --> 36:14.755
Get your hand off me.

36:14.831 --> 36:16.459
I don't want to see you guys
here again.

36:16.533 --> 36:19.594
Yeah? Well, do what we
tell you next time.

36:21.471 --> 36:24.839
This is a bad idea.

36:24.908 --> 36:30.873
] It's more complicated
than it looks.

36:34.651 --> 36:37.587
] Oops.

36:49.266 --> 36:51.394
I don't know what to say.

36:51.468 --> 36:54.233
] The first thing that
comes to mind.

36:55.439 --> 36:57.533
I don't know if you're a
stalker I should be worried

36:57.608 --> 37:02.205
about, or a devoted lover
I should admire.

37:02.279 --> 37:05.807
] I'm neither. C'mon.
Have a seat.

37:43.587 --> 37:45.283
So what's the
chances these three deaths are

37:45.355 --> 37:49.554
one big coincidence?
Okay, not a coincidence.

37:49.993 --> 37:51.621
Let's go over
the events of last night.

37:51.695 --> 37:53.755
"Blue Screen" figures on us
putting units on these guys, so

37:53.830 --> 37:57.631
he knows he has to get one or
both of them immediately.

38:14.017 --> 38:14.882
There's a what?

38:14.951 --> 38:15.680
There's a guy killing people.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.914
I'm supposed to tell you
about fuckin' killin'?

38:17.988 --> 38:19.388
] I'm asking you if
you've heard anything about it.

38:19.456 --> 38:21.425
] When did you ever
help me out? When?

38:21.491 --> 38:23.323
Tell me one fuckin' time
you ever helped me out.

38:23.393 --> 38:25.521
You know what? Get the
fuck outta here!

38:25.595 --> 38:28.759
See you later!
All set. Here we go.

38:29.766 --> 38:30.893
Anything I should know about?

38:30.967 --> 38:32.401
No. They're not helping.

38:32.469 --> 38:33.960
They've never heard of
Blue Screen?

38:36.773 --> 38:39.572
] Adamson...

38:39.643 --> 38:42.579
Make me happy...

38:42.913 --> 38:45.575
You're the man, Jimmy. Thanks.

38:45.648 --> 38:46.547
All three match?

38:46.615 --> 38:48.607
I knew you'd make a good
detective some day.

38:48.684 --> 38:50.880
So you going to tell me
what you were thinking earlier?

38:50.953 --> 38:53.388
Maybe Chaise
deleted Wilkinson and Kyusovich.

38:53.456 --> 38:55.550
That would explain why there
was no forced entry in

38:55.624 --> 38:58.856
Wilkinson's apartment.
Wilkinson actually invited

38:58.928 --> 39:00.726
Chaise in.

39:00.796 --> 39:03.459
I certainly hope that's the
case. What we don't need is an

39:03.532 --> 39:06.400
assassin running around Vegas
making a name for himself.

39:06.469 --> 39:09.496
Let's say Blue Screen is real.

39:09.572 --> 39:11.871
If we catch him, we could
discourage any other

39:11.941 --> 39:13.967
copycat killers.

39:14.043 --> 39:15.909
Alright, look. Let's
keep working on the assumption that

39:15.978 --> 39:18.971
there is a Blue Screen, and he
is involved.

39:19.048 --> 39:21.449
So what's our next move?

39:21.517 --> 39:25.352
Find the broker.

40:08.898 --> 40:09.797
Obriga.

40:09.865 --> 40:14.166
Obriga.

40:14.437 --> 40:16.963
So this is your infamous
buddy?

40:17.039 --> 40:21.170
Damon, this is Detective
White. White, Damon Ridell.

40:21.444 --> 40:22.776
Nice to meet you, convict.

40:22.845 --> 40:24.040
Take it easy, White.

40:24.113 --> 40:27.515
Way I hear it, you're a
cold-blooded pusher looking for

40:27.583 --> 40:29.711
a reason to get back
in the joint.

40:29.785 --> 40:30.809
What have you been telling him?

40:30.886 --> 40:31.854
Nothing!

40:31.921 --> 40:35.688
White, take a walk! Meet me
back here in 10.

40:42.164 --> 40:44.895
Look, I need you to talk to me.

40:45.234 --> 40:47.169
Tell you what.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.899
You get in the cage with me
for one round, I'll tell you

40:49.972 --> 40:51.668
everything you need to know.

40:51.740 --> 40:53.675
You're kidding

40:53.943 --> 40:56.435
Time's tickin'.

41:48.030 --> 41:48.630
Talk!

41:48.631 --> 41:49.758
] What?
Tap.

41:49.832 --> 41:53.894
] Talk!
] Tap!

41:53.969 --> 41:56.097
] Talk!

41:57.239 --> 42:00.572
Stubborn bastard.

42:04.712 --> 42:05.941
Wow. Hello.

42:06.014 --> 42:07.983
Hi.

42:16.157 --> 42:18.524
So what the Hell are you
getting yourself into?

42:18.593 --> 42:22.121
Look, you have got to start
trusting me, Jack.

42:22.196 --> 42:25.655
Damon, I can't trust you if
you keep me in the dark.

42:25.733 --> 42:27.861
I'm doing this for Roy, ok?

42:27.936 --> 42:30.098
You're gonna go back to jail
for him?

42:30.171 --> 42:33.938
No. But I owe him big time.

42:34.008 --> 42:37.035
By being a murder broker?

42:38.746 --> 42:39.770
] That's a pretty
serious accusation.

42:39.847 --> 42:43.875
It's not an accusation. It's
just a suspicion.

42:43.952 --> 42:45.853
I haven't even told my
partner yet.

42:45.920 --> 42:51.120
And what a pleasant
individual he is.

42:53.761 --> 42:55.855
I got a line on a broker,
alright?

42:55.930 --> 42:58.024
I can't confirm he's
involved in this.

42:58.099 --> 43:00.830
If you want to check it
out yourself, that's your business.

43:00.902 --> 43:03.997
But he goes by the alias
"El Corredor. "

43:04.072 --> 43:06.303
He owns a rattlesnake
restaurant down in Tijuana.

43:06.374 --> 43:10.072
You should be able to take
it from there.

43:10.278 --> 43:12.611
Okay. Thanks, Damon.

43:12.680 --> 43:15.707
Good fight. Oops, sorry.

43:15.783 --> 43:19.311
] It's alright.

43:23.157 --> 43:25.786
] Hey. You okay?

43:25.860 --> 43:26.725
] Yeah.

43:26.794 --> 43:28.023
] Whatchu got?

43:28.096 --> 43:30.930
Feel like going to Mexico?

43:42.744 --> 43:44.235
Real classy guy.

43:44.312 --> 43:47.771
] Yeah, I bet your
sister'd like him.

43:48.249 --> 43:51.947
You know my sister? 'Cause
she probably would like him.

43:52.887 --> 43:54.082
You ready?

43:54.155 --> 43:57.319
Ready for what? Oh, come on.

43:57.392 --> 43:58.758
We can't just waltz in there
and tell this guy we're

43:58.826 --> 44:01.921
investigating him for a crime
in another country for which we

44:01.996 --> 44:05.899
have no witnesses or no
evidence.

44:05.967 --> 44:08.903
That makes sense.

44:10.238 --> 44:13.640
Let's just hang back. We'll
check things out later.

44:27.722 --> 44:33.060
Bienvenido,
mi amigo. Como estas?

44:54.048 --> 45:00.047
You know this guy?

45:13.868 --> 45:19.137
Same as before. I already took
my 20%.

45:20.907 --> 45:26.039
Look, the employer is
very happy with your work.

45:26.113 --> 45:31.212
And you've impressed me.

45:46.299 --> 45:49.030
What?

45:49.102 --> 45:51.970
I think that may be our guy.

45:54.241 --> 45:55.209
Why?

45:55.275 --> 45:59.906
Doesn't he look a little out
of place here?

46:02.415 --> 46:05.249
So what are we waiting for? I
mean, why don't we go after him?

46:05.318 --> 46:07.446
Nah, I got his plate when he
came in.

46:07.521 --> 46:10.355
We'll put him through the
system when we get back.

46:10.423 --> 46:14.121
Look, your hunches
have been pretty accurate so far.

46:14.194 --> 46:15.287
] Why don't we have an
unmarked pick him up

46:15.362 --> 46:16.455
at San Ysidro?

46:16.530 --> 46:17.930
Then someone in the
department's gonna know we've

46:17.998 --> 46:20.092
been down here beyond our
jurisdiction.

46:20.167 --> 46:24.070
Come on, I thought you were
supposed to be a detective.

46:25.305 --> 46:27.035
] Alright, you ready?

46:27.107 --> 46:29.401
Yeah, let's do this.

46:37.117 --> 46:42.422
] Shh. Alright.

46:44.491 --> 46:47.518
You know, for a
detective renowned for playing by the

46:47.594 --> 46:51.497
rules, you sure break
a lot of them.

46:54.301 --> 46:57.829
] Look, it's all about
image and perception.

46:57.904 --> 47:00.100
As long as you follow the
rules while everyone's looking,

47:00.173 --> 47:01.937
get the results everybody wants,
you can tweak the

47:02.008 --> 47:04.000
laws here and there.

47:04.277 --> 47:07.441
] True that.

47:07.948 --> 47:09.348
] Plus, the best thing
is... the Federales

47:09.416 --> 47:11.317
are easy to bribe.

47:11.384 --> 47:13.012
] How would you know that?

47:13.086 --> 47:16.215
] Hey, I could have a
dark and mysterious past.

47:16.289 --> 47:20.556
No, you
couldn't.

47:20.627 --> 47:22.926
Yeah, you're right.
I couldn't.

47:27.033 --> 47:29.969
] Alright.

47:56.229 --> 47:58.221
] I thought this guy was
supposed to have money.

47:58.298 --> 48:00.961
That's what they say.

48:02.168 --> 48:03.602
] Did you bring a bug?

48:03.670 --> 48:05.298
] If we leave behind
evidence we were here, then

48:05.372 --> 48:07.967
we're gonna get thrown off the
case and demoted.

48:09.442 --> 48:13.470
Can you crack that thing?

48:13.546 --> 48:17.074
Not quickly enough.

48:22.455 --> 48:24.447
] Jack.

48:30.029 --> 48:31.622
I'm not seeing anything
else here.

48:31.697 --> 48:35.099
Yeah. You ready
to blow this pop stand?

48:37.236 --> 48:38.204
] Wait a second.

48:38.270 --> 48:42.901
What? What's that?

48:42.975 --> 48:45.069
] Looks like a wax seal.

48:46.578 --> 48:48.206
] Let's take it with us.

48:48.280 --> 48:51.079
Alright.

48:57.990 --> 49:00.926
] Alright.

49:01.961 --> 49:03.395
] You ready to get back
to the good ol' U.S. of A.?

49:03.462 --> 49:06.489
] Yeah. Let's go.

49:13.439 --> 49:18.939
Adamson... Thanks, Jimmy.

49:22.014 --> 49:22.747
What?

49:22.748 --> 49:25.183
Standard candle wax. You can
buy it in any arts

49:25.250 --> 49:28.584
and crafts store.

49:29.154 --> 49:30.281
] Wasted night.

49:30.356 --> 49:32.655
Yep.

49:59.618 --> 50:02.383
I need you to tell me about
these guys, Roy.

50:02.454 --> 50:04.514
What do you want to know?
They're dead.

50:04.590 --> 50:06.491
Tell me about your
relationship with them.

50:06.558 --> 50:09.118
I'm not involved. So
our relationship isn't relevant.

50:09.194 --> 50:11.527
No, it is. The evidence is
starting to mount against you.

50:11.597 --> 50:13.429
Evidence? What evidence?

50:13.499 --> 50:14.523
Don't get defensive.

50:14.600 --> 50:17.126
Well, Jack, you're accusing
me of murder, so I'm gonna get a

50:17.202 --> 50:18.170
little defensive.

50:18.237 --> 50:19.535
Roy, I'm here as a friend.

50:19.605 --> 50:21.574
Are you?

50:21.640 --> 50:23.336
Did you
see Wilkinson the night

50:23.409 --> 50:25.037
he was killed?

50:25.110 --> 50:28.046
Ok, if I was there, and I
did, you know we have

50:28.113 --> 50:30.412
business together.

50:30.482 --> 50:33.543
I can't believe you lied to me.

50:33.619 --> 50:35.747
Alright, let's take a walk.

50:35.821 --> 50:37.517
Okay, so what
did Kyusovich tell you?

50:37.589 --> 50:40.024
Don't worry about that, Roy.
Tell me your story.

50:40.092 --> 50:44.052
Okay. It started about four
years ago. We were working on

50:44.129 --> 50:46.098
this really intricate way of

50:46.165 --> 50:47.656
] Whoa... "We?"
] manufacturing...

50:47.733 --> 50:50.430
Yeah. Sukay and me.

50:51.370 --> 50:53.236
But because the market
started to downturn, I couldn't

50:53.305 --> 50:56.742
raise the necessary capital
through legitimate channels.

50:56.809 --> 51:00.576
And then, I met Kyusovich.
And he was able to raise the

51:00.646 --> 51:04.583
funds through... other ways.

51:04.650 --> 51:06.380
They agreed to let us keep
the domestic profits,

51:06.452 --> 51:10.048
But they were insistent on
retaining complete rights over

51:10.122 --> 51:11.249
the international revenue.

51:11.323 --> 51:14.191
Ah, well, then they sent us off
to Moscow to adapt our process

51:14.259 --> 51:17.627
for a Russian radiology
network.

51:29.575 --> 51:30.508
Okay, go on.

52:00.571 --> 52:03.200
I managed to
escape and flee the country.

52:03.274 --> 52:05.470
Why didn't you just go to
the local police?

52:05.543 --> 52:07.478
Well, because during the
attack, one of them kept saying

52:07.545 --> 52:11.778
"Kyusovich. " So with the Russian
mob there, I just figured that

52:11.849 --> 52:15.377
the local cops were in their
back pocket.

52:15.453 --> 52:17.319
Alright, well what happened
when you got back to the States?

52:17.388 --> 52:19.823
So in order to get even with
them for killing Sukay, I

52:19.891 --> 52:22.486
modified the code so that it
would only work on

52:22.560 --> 52:24.222
U.S. networks.

52:24.295 --> 52:28.232
I got rich, and Kyusovich and
company lost their investment.

52:28.299 --> 52:29.426
And they just let this go?

52:29.500 --> 52:31.731
Hell no.

52:31.802 --> 52:34.135
Because I escaped, I was a
witness to their murder.

52:34.205 --> 52:36.572
And Kyosovich threatened to
tell the Russian mob where I was

52:36.641 --> 52:39.372
unless I paid him hush money.

52:39.443 --> 52:42.379
So that's where the $10,000
a month comes from.

52:42.647 --> 52:43.512
How did you know that?

52:43.581 --> 52:46.380
Roy, I'm a Detective. You know
it's my job to find that out.

52:46.450 --> 52:48.351
And that's exactly what you
told Damon before you

52:48.419 --> 52:49.318
Mirandized him.

52:49.387 --> 52:53.256
Whoa, take it easy. Roy, I
hate what I do. You know that.

52:53.324 --> 52:54.348
Then why do you do it?

52:54.425 --> 52:59.295
Because I have to.
I have no choice.

53:01.499 --> 53:03.195
Angela wants out.

53:03.267 --> 53:04.326
Out? Out of what?

53:04.402 --> 53:06.462
Everything. Sell the house,
the cars, the businesses.

53:06.537 --> 53:09.166
Run off to the islands, Costa
Rica, wherever.

53:09.240 --> 53:09.673
Are you considering it?

53:09.674 --> 53:13.475
Yes! I don't know.

53:13.544 --> 53:19.451
But hypothetically if we go,
would you come with us?

53:20.518 --> 53:23.317
I mean, Roy, that'd be
great, but...

53:23.387 --> 53:26.653
Jack, it'll be just like
old times.

53:28.259 --> 53:32.253
Roy, I can't. Look, I can't
leave Vegas.

53:32.330 --> 53:37.496
Jack. She's not coming back.

53:41.606 --> 53:42.005
You don't have to wait...

53:42.006 --> 53:44.271
I know.

53:46.777 --> 53:49.542
Let me buy you lunch.

53:54.252 --> 53:54.751
] Hi.

53:54.752 --> 53:55.452
Something to drink?

53:55.453 --> 53:56.648
Yeah I'll just have a water.

53:56.721 --> 53:57.882
] Iced tea is great.
Thank you.

53:57.955 --> 53:59.924
] Iced Tea.
No problem.

54:01.025 --> 54:03.551
So are you going to let me
take a look at your phone bills?

54:03.628 --> 54:05.824
Why? What are you looking for?

54:05.896 --> 54:08.422
It depends. What are you hiding?

54:08.499 --> 54:10.525
I gotta hit the john.

54:10.601 --> 54:13.628
Yeah, good luck.

54:20.878 --> 54:23.507
Talk to him
about Los Angeles, Jack.

54:24.815 --> 54:28.411
] Thank you.

54:30.988 --> 54:32.889
Hey, so why don't you tell
me about L.A.

54:32.957 --> 54:35.552
What do you mean?

54:36.861 --> 54:40.298
Listen, Jack, the fortunes
of some are often precipitated by

54:40.364 --> 54:41.124
the misfortunes of others.

54:41.299 --> 54:43.996
It happens all the time, and
you can't expect me to feel bad

54:44.068 --> 54:44.834
about that.

54:44.835 --> 54:47.270
Yeah, well, you know
what? We've been friends for 25 years,

54:47.338 --> 54:50.831
Roy. 25 years. I want to know
why you didn't tell me about

54:50.908 --> 54:51.474
any of this.

54:51.475 --> 54:54.468
Because, Jack. You're such
a freakin honest cop, and I didn't

54:54.545 --> 54:56.514
want you treating me like every
other suspect.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.572
And I didn't want you digging
and finding connections that

54:58.649 --> 54:59.947
weren't there. Listen -

55:00.017 --> 55:00.749
Roy...

55:00.750 --> 55:03.948
I just didn't want you
judging me, alright?

55:04.020 --> 55:08.549
I just... just didn't want us
to lose what we had.

55:08.625 --> 55:10.685
You have to admit, it's
kinda funny how people tend to

55:10.760 --> 55:14.356
die when they disagree with you.

55:14.964 --> 55:19.925
Thank you... for perfectly
proving my point.

55:20.003 --> 55:25.567
Christ, Jack. Who are you?

55:26.643 --> 55:29.044
Jesus.

55:34.851 --> 55:35.384
Yeah.

55:35.385 --> 55:37.581
Hey, Jack. Just wanted
to let you know your partner and

55:37.654 --> 55:39.486
the other officers are at
Roy's right now.

55:39.556 --> 55:42.617
Okay. You get the warrant
and I'll bring him in.

55:42.692 --> 55:43.625
Alright.

55:43.693 --> 55:44.456
Leave an unmarked there.

55:44.527 --> 55:46.496
Copy.

55:46.763 --> 55:49.756
Shit.

55:49.833 --> 55:53.861
Roy! Look, we just raided
your house.

55:53.937 --> 55:55.769
You did what?

55:55.839 --> 55:58.900
Look, we found evidence. They're
getting an arrest warrant.

55:58.975 --> 56:00.841
You're fucking unbelievable.

56:00.910 --> 56:06.042
I'm sorry. But now's your
chance, okay? Don't go home.

56:06.116 --> 56:08.085
Turn your cell phone off, get
out of town, and don't tell

56:08.151 --> 56:10.916
anyone except Angela where
you're going.

56:10.987 --> 56:12.387
Yeah, now I can see why
she left.

56:12.455 --> 56:15.015
No, you...

56:18.661 --> 56:19.924
I'll do what I can.

56:19.996 --> 56:22.864
Yeah? And you'll always put
your work before your

56:22.932 --> 56:24.423
friends, Jack.

56:24.501 --> 56:27.869
That's not fair!

56:35.578 --> 56:36.910
What are the chances your
Sicilian friends are

56:36.980 --> 56:37.646
involved in this?

56:37.647 --> 56:38.842
There isn't.

56:38.915 --> 56:39.712
How can you be so sure?

56:39.783 --> 56:42.651
I'm sure.

56:45.155 --> 56:46.020
Anything?

56:46.089 --> 56:49.150
Still nothing. The
woman came by about 15 minutes ago. She

56:49.426 --> 56:52.863
only went in for about 5
minutes, then drove off.

56:53.096 --> 56:55.395
Well, did anybody follow her?

56:56.566 --> 56:59.035
Copy.

57:00.737 --> 57:03.434
So where do we look next?

57:07.944 --> 57:09.537
Mr. Ridell.

57:09.612 --> 57:12.980
Detective White. Nice to see
you're still carrying the old

57:13.049 --> 57:15.450
torch for me.

57:15.518 --> 57:18.044
And thank you, friend, for
telling me that you're working

57:18.121 --> 57:18.520
with him.

57:18.521 --> 57:18.854
Roy...

57:18.855 --> 57:20.551
I don't know where you're
going with this investigation,

57:20.623 --> 57:23.650
but I am not a criminal.
I'm a respectable

57:23.726 --> 57:26.821
businessman, and as such I am
willing to cooperate with you

57:26.896 --> 57:30.060
gentlemen in any way I can.
Tell me what evidence it is

57:30.133 --> 57:32.534
that you think you have against
me, and I'll try to explain it.

57:32.602 --> 57:34.730
Thank you. I appreciate
that, but you have the right to

57:34.804 --> 57:35.533
remain silent.

57:35.605 --> 57:39.508
I know, but silence won't
help me now.

57:41.544 --> 57:45.481
We recorded a conversation
between you, Quarrie and Chaise.

57:45.548 --> 57:48.712
I believe you said "Let's
say I don't kill you.

57:48.785 --> 57:50.651
How much is that worth?"
And that sounds like

57:50.720 --> 57:54.623
premeditation to me, which
amounts to Murder 1.

57:54.691 --> 57:56.819
I simply said what I needed
to to get them out of my house.

57:56.893 --> 57:59.590
And let us not forget,
Detective White, that it was

57:59.662 --> 58:02.131
your boy that killed Chaise.

58:03.867 --> 58:05.529
Well, can you explain the cash?

58:05.602 --> 58:07.662
What cash?

58:07.971 --> 58:10.566
He doesn't know about the money.

58:10.640 --> 58:12.973
Angie, what are you
talking about?

58:13.042 --> 58:16.068
I've lent Damon some money
to find his feet. I've made a

58:16.144 --> 58:17.806
few withdrawals.

58:17.880 --> 58:19.007
How much?

58:19.081 --> 58:19.980
50 grand.

58:20.048 --> 58:21.573
Oh, Goddamnit.

58:21.650 --> 58:22.515
He's gonna pay us back.

58:22.584 --> 58:24.917
I know. That's not the point.

58:24.987 --> 58:27.582
I transferred ten grand to him
as well.

58:27.656 --> 58:29.648
Why?

58:29.725 --> 58:31.091
Legal fees.

58:31.159 --> 58:34.687
So what, he's playing both
of us for money?

58:34.763 --> 58:36.755
Why would Damon want to
set you up?

58:36.832 --> 58:39.199
He wouldn't. It Judy doesn't
make any sense.

58:39.268 --> 58:41.635
Roy, I don't know what Damon
has planned.

58:41.703 --> 58:44.798
Alright, the safest place for
you and Angela is right here.

58:44.873 --> 58:46.739
Well, you'll forgive me,
Detective Adamson, if I don't

58:46.808 --> 58:50.677
feel safe staying in such a
public place.

58:50.746 --> 58:53.716
I think it might be better if
no one knew where we were.

58:53.782 --> 58:56.274
Look, you may be fooling
him, but I'm gonna get you this

58:56.552 --> 58:58.783
time, motherfucker.

58:59.988 --> 59:02.822
Bring it.

59:13.135 --> 59:15.695
Tell me about Damon's jail time.

59:15.771 --> 59:19.003
Well, not much to tell. He did
five years... model prisoner.

59:19.074 --> 59:20.599
I called in a few favors.
Got him out early.

59:20.676 --> 59:22.736
It was all above the table.

59:22.811 --> 59:25.076
Did you ever see him in jail?

59:25.147 --> 59:27.776
No, whenever I went there,
he refused to see me.

59:27.849 --> 59:29.249
And you say he got out on
Wednesday, right?

59:29.318 --> 59:30.581
Yeah. What's this about?

59:30.652 --> 59:33.053
Look, I did some digging
and found some video, recorded

59:33.121 --> 59:37.582
at Henderson Executive Airport,
on Monday.

59:37.659 --> 59:39.992
Watch this.

59:41.296 --> 59:43.959
Now that plane had no
markings and no flight plan with

59:44.032 --> 59:46.763
the FAA. And he was the only one
who disembarked.

59:46.835 --> 59:48.235
Wait, this doesn't make
any sense.

59:48.303 --> 59:51.171
Now the prison records
indicate that he did his time

59:51.239 --> 59:54.073
and was released on Wednesday,
but I checked with his

59:54.142 --> 59:57.135
neighbors on his cell block, and
none of them had ever seen or

59:57.212 --> 59:58.646
heard of him.

59:58.714 --> 01:00:01.149
You telling me he didn't do
any jail time?

01:00:01.216 --> 01:00:04.675
Looks that way.

01:00:05.821 --> 01:00:07.687
You join the stakeout at
Roy's motel.

01:00:07.756 --> 01:00:09.748
I'll find Damon... see if
he'll come in voluntarily.

01:00:09.825 --> 01:00:12.287
Now you're talking.

01:00:14.129 --> 01:00:15.893
Now, keep an eye
on the perimeter. Make sure that

01:00:15.964 --> 01:00:20.868
nobody comes up behind us.
Alright? Good job, Officer.

01:00:33.849 --> 01:00:34.714
Adamson.

01:00:34.783 --> 01:00:36.718
Guess whose just pulled
into the motel.

01:00:36.785 --> 01:00:38.117
Surprise me.

01:00:38.186 --> 01:00:40.121
Mr. Quarrie.

01:00:40.188 --> 01:00:41.850
At the same motel?

01:00:41.923 --> 01:00:44.916
Uh huh. And he just checked
into the room right next to our

01:00:44.993 --> 01:00:47.622
old friend Mr. Ridell.

01:00:47.696 --> 01:00:49.688
Huh. You mean to tell
me that something's actually going

01:00:49.765 --> 01:00:51.961
to be convenient for us?

01:00:52.034 --> 01:00:54.367
I'm here to tell you.

01:00:54.436 --> 01:00:57.634
Okay. As soon as I'm
done with dinner, I'll head over.

01:00:57.706 --> 01:01:01.006
Okay. See you soon.

01:01:04.112 --> 01:01:06.138
No.

01:01:06.214 --> 01:01:07.705
You have certain
obligations to us.

01:01:07.783 --> 01:01:09.012
Don't remind me.

01:01:09.084 --> 01:01:10.848
It's our job to remind you.

01:01:10.919 --> 01:01:12.751
Why don't you do me a favor
for once, Saffiote?

01:01:12.821 --> 01:01:13.789
You want me to do you a favor?

01:01:13.855 --> 01:01:14.288
Yeah.

01:01:14.289 --> 01:01:15.086
What is it, Jack?

01:01:15.157 --> 01:01:16.750
] Tell me about the
Russian mob.

01:01:16.825 --> 01:01:21.354
The Russian mob? A bunch
of undisciplined drunks.

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:22.659
] So you know them.

01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:25.223
Yeah, I know them. We
had a few dealings with 'em.

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:27.428
Dug a few holes. Sent 'em a
message.

01:01:27.703 --> 01:01:29.262
We didn't want to get
you involved.

01:01:29.337 --> 01:01:31.430
You didn't want them to
encroach on your territory?

01:01:31.706 --> 01:01:34.972
Whoa. You said it, not us.

01:01:35.976 --> 01:01:37.274
You don't look too happy.

01:01:37.344 --> 01:01:39.904
Should I be?

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.676
Look, would you hear about
it if they were trying to make

01:01:41.749 --> 01:01:44.378
another move here? Maybe try to
tie up some loose ends?

01:01:44.452 --> 01:01:47.388
Probably... but I don't
think I'd tell you.

01:01:47.455 --> 01:01:47.987
Okay.

01:01:47.988 --> 01:01:50.753
Where you going, Jack?

01:01:50.858 --> 01:01:52.087
What's it to you?

01:01:52.159 --> 01:01:54.185
Well we have somebody
coming to dinner to join us.

01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:55.126
Excuse me?

01:01:55.196 --> 01:01:57.722
You know... Kim. We've
seen you together, Jack. You

01:01:57.798 --> 01:02:03.329
guys make a good couple...
Why don't you give her a shot?

01:02:04.405 --> 01:02:06.340
C'mon, you've been alone
too long. Look at this kid

01:02:06.407 --> 01:02:09.138
over here.

01:02:27.228 --> 01:02:27.894
Hey.

01:02:27.895 --> 01:02:28.294
How's it going?

01:02:28.295 --> 01:02:29.160
Good.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:31.756
Just brainstorming here...
let's say the Russian mob was

01:02:31.832 --> 01:02:33.767
trying to make another play for
Vegas, they'd want to make a

01:02:33.834 --> 01:02:34.501
name for themselves, right?

01:02:34.502 --> 01:02:35.868
Absolutely.

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:38.030
Well what better way to do
that than to set a few examples

01:02:38.105 --> 01:02:39.801
before they come?

01:02:39.874 --> 01:02:41.240
Yeah, but would they kill
their own man?

01:02:41.308 --> 01:02:45.006
Who? Kyusovich? C'mon. He
wasn't the most pleasant guy we

01:02:45.079 --> 01:02:46.274
ever met.

01:02:46.347 --> 01:02:48.282
No, but wouldn't they want
him around for, like,

01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:50.944
introductions around town?

01:02:51.018 --> 01:02:53.146
I'm still working on that one.

01:02:53.220 --> 01:02:56.486
Anyways, what's going on
here? Where they at?

01:02:56.557 --> 01:03:01.758
Ridell is in 6. Quarrie 7.

01:03:02.830 --> 01:03:05.197
I'm gonna go talk to Roy.

01:03:05.466 --> 01:03:06.798
You want me to go with you?

01:03:06.867 --> 01:03:09.393
No, you hang back here. Keep an
eye on things.

01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:11.200
Call me if anyone comes.

01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:14.037
] You got it.

01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:20.973
Baby, it's not worth it. Yeah,
it was paradise when we first

01:03:21.048 --> 01:03:22.448
moved here, but we need to
move on.

01:03:22.516 --> 01:03:25.884
No, we don't need to move on.
I've put in too much time and

01:03:25.953 --> 01:03:28.548
worked too hard to build what we
have here.

01:03:28.823 --> 01:03:31.554
I just want this whole mess
to blow over, so that we can go

01:03:31.826 --> 01:03:33.522
back to the way it was.

01:03:37.431 --> 01:03:38.421
Who is it?

01:03:38.499 --> 01:03:40.468
It's Jack.

01:03:42.937 --> 01:03:44.371
] Are you alone?

01:03:44.438 --> 01:03:47.033
White's in the car outside.

01:03:48.843 --> 01:03:50.141
It's the Russians.

01:03:50.211 --> 01:03:52.510
] What?

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:53.411
] What haven't you
told me?

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.539
I told you everything.

01:03:54.615 --> 01:03:57.380
]Tell me about
the Russians!

01:03:57.451 --> 01:04:00.853
Alright.

01:04:01.088 --> 01:04:03.489
Start talking.

01:04:03.624 --> 01:04:08.927
Alright. Alright, the money
that Kyusovich and the others

01:04:08.996 --> 01:04:13.161
invested in the company was
Russian mob money.

01:04:13.234 --> 01:04:15.465
And?

01:04:15.536 --> 01:04:18.370
So Kyusovich thought he could
regain control of all the

01:04:18.439 --> 01:04:22.035
domestic profits by killing
Sukay and me.

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:24.408
But obviously that backfired.

01:04:24.478 --> 01:04:27.107
We met this guy in Mexico
named El Corredor.

01:04:27.181 --> 01:04:30.049
Yeah I know him.

01:04:31.619 --> 01:04:34.282
Of course you do.

01:04:34.355 --> 01:04:36.847
Well then I heard that the
Russians were mad at Kyusovich

01:04:36.924 --> 01:04:39.086
for losing their money,
So I thought if they killed

01:04:39.159 --> 01:04:42.527
him, they could get away
with it. And then in turn, that

01:04:42.596 --> 01:04:45.964
would get me off the hook with
all the blackmail payments.

01:04:46.033 --> 01:04:48.866
So I made a call to the
Russians, gave them some

01:04:48.935 --> 01:04:50.995
convincing evidence that
Kyusovich lost their money

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:54.404
gambling. And then, I told them
where they could find

01:04:54.474 --> 01:04:57.342
El Corredor.

01:04:57.410 --> 01:05:03.341
Roy... So you are -
indirectly - responsible.

01:05:05.418 --> 01:05:07.046
Jack I may have given them
the weapon, but I didn't

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:07.519
pull the trigger.

01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:11.582
People have been convicted
for less!

01:05:11.658 --> 01:05:15.095
Nothing ever happened, so I
assumed that they let it go.

01:05:15.161 --> 01:05:16.561
But you did set this whole
thing in motion?

01:05:16.629 --> 01:05:18.928
Look, Jack, they tried to
screw me, so I screwed them

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:20.364
right back. But I didn't kill
anybody.

01:05:20.433 --> 01:05:24.268
Okay! You're right. Pulling
the trigger is what counts.

01:05:24.337 --> 01:05:26.101
But we may still have to
charge you with Solicitation or

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.438
even Accessory.

01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:35.013
Don't worry... I'm sure a good
lawyer could get you out of it.

01:05:35.081 --> 01:05:35.614
If it was the Russians.

01:05:35.615 --> 01:05:37.243
Right.

01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:39.513
Well, we need to warn Quarrie.

01:05:39.585 --> 01:05:42.555
That's easy. He's right
next door.

01:05:42.622 --> 01:05:45.490
You've gotta be joking.

01:05:50.063 --> 01:05:52.362
] You guys stay here.

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.283
Mr. Quarrie?

01:06:13.252 --> 01:06:18.054
Mr. Quarrie, it's the Police!
Open up!

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:35.569
Please forgive me.
They were my friends. I don't know

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:43.704
why I did it. I just can't live
with it any more.

01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:48.179
What? What is it?

01:07:48.247 --> 01:07:51.411
] The Russians aren't
coming.

01:08:02.427 --> 01:08:04.828
So Quarrie had Chaise kill his
other two friends so they could

01:08:05.097 --> 01:08:08.625
get all the blackmail money.
He felt guilty and

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.829
killed himself.

01:08:12.537 --> 01:08:14.301
Yes.

01:08:14.372 --> 01:08:17.774
So after all this, you didn't
save any lives or

01:08:17.843 --> 01:08:20.278
bring in any collars.

01:08:20.345 --> 01:08:21.278
No, ma'am.

01:08:21.345 --> 01:08:24.510
Great. Nice work.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.142
Sorry we let you down, Captain.

01:08:26.218 --> 01:08:27.709
Good thing we're not paying
you commission.

01:08:27.786 --> 01:08:30.153
With your permission, I'd
like to keep the case open...

01:08:30.221 --> 01:08:32.622
see if there really is a
Blue Screen.

01:08:32.691 --> 01:08:35.286
But I need permission to
wiretap El Corredor's office.

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:40.162
You know I can't authorize that.
Do your digging on your turf.

01:08:40.232 --> 01:08:42.167
You two can go now.

01:08:42.234 --> 01:08:44.703
Thank you, ma'am.

01:08:45.470 --> 01:08:47.200
I'll catch up with you in
a minute.

01:08:47.272 --> 01:08:50.332
Okay.

01:08:54.779 --> 01:08:57.442
So what's on your mind, Jack?

01:08:57.515 --> 01:08:59.246
It's Detective White, ma'am.

01:08:59.317 --> 01:09:01.115
You're going to tell me how you
hate working with a partner and

01:09:01.185 --> 01:09:02.745
No, no, no, he's a fine
partner.

01:09:02.821 --> 01:09:05.346
What's the problem, then?

01:09:09.294 --> 01:09:12.127
He may be the Blue Screen.

01:09:14.533 --> 01:09:16.331
That's a pretty serious
accusation.

01:09:16.401 --> 01:09:19.667
Look, I know it's a
stretch, but all the pieces fit.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:21.536
We don't know who the hell
authorized his transfer from

01:09:21.606 --> 01:09:24.701
L.A., but it did all happen
before Wilkinson.

01:09:24.943 --> 01:09:25.643
It did?

01:09:25.644 --> 01:09:28.671
It's the only way
the timing would have worked.

01:09:29.514 --> 01:09:31.312
And he's the one who
proposed that a professional was

01:09:31.383 --> 01:09:33.408
involved in the first place.

01:09:33.484 --> 01:09:37.581
Okay. Go on.

01:09:37.656 --> 01:09:39.682
I didn't see him when the
others were killed.

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:41.488
There are a million people in
the city you didn't see when the

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.895
murders took place.
Jack, I can't have you accuse a

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:48.763
decorated officer... with
connections... of murder based on

01:09:48.832 --> 01:09:52.361
circumstantial evidence.
See if you can find something

01:09:52.437 --> 01:09:54.633
solid, but otherwise don't
mention this to anyone.

01:09:54.706 --> 01:09:55.674
Okay.

01:09:55.740 --> 01:09:56.867
Don't mention this. Ever.

01:09:56.942 --> 01:10:00.902
I heard you.

01:10:02.414 --> 01:10:04.349
] What are you doing?

01:10:04.416 --> 01:10:05.679
We just got a new case.

01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:08.379
No, we're keeping the
Blue Screen open.

01:10:08.453 --> 01:10:09.648
We have all these notes in
the file, Jack.

01:10:09.721 --> 01:10:13.658
Yeah, well that board helps
me think.

01:10:13.725 --> 01:10:18.720
Okay. You're still hung up
on Quarrie. I mean, what's up?

01:10:18.797 --> 01:10:20.629
It just doesn't sit well.

01:10:20.699 --> 01:10:23.760
Quarrie copped to it in his
note. It's over, Jack.

01:10:23.835 --> 01:10:25.736
What more do you want?

01:10:25.804 --> 01:10:28.205
Funny you're supposed to be
this great cop that doesn't let

01:10:28.273 --> 01:10:29.502
anyone get away.

01:10:29.574 --> 01:10:33.511
Jack, it's not the biggest
case of my life.

01:10:33.578 --> 01:10:36.480
Let me ask you something, Mason.

01:10:36.548 --> 01:10:40.747
How'd you find out
about Wilkinson so quickly?

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:45.484
I told you, Jack. I had
Ridell and his associates put on

01:10:45.557 --> 01:10:48.823
a watch list. I'm down here for
Ridell. And frankly, I don't

01:10:48.893 --> 01:10:50.828
want to spend another minute on
this case unless we can

01:10:50.895 --> 01:10:51.954
tie it to Ridell.

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:52.763
Don't make this a vendetta.

01:10:52.764 --> 01:10:54.255
Listen, you're the only one
who wants to prove the

01:10:54.332 --> 01:10:56.494
Blue Screen exists. If you
weren't so hell-bent on making a

01:10:56.568 --> 01:10:57.501
name for yourself...

01:10:57.569 --> 01:10:59.595
Oh, please. Not everyone's
motivated by fame and fortune,

01:10:59.671 --> 01:11:02.732
Mason.

01:11:03.775 --> 01:11:04.970
What do you want to do
here, Jack?

01:11:05.043 --> 01:11:06.306
I want to catch the Blue Screen!

01:11:06.378 --> 01:11:08.677
There is no Blue Screen! He
doesn't exist!

01:11:08.747 --> 01:11:11.979
Quarrie ordered it; Chaise
did it. End of story.

01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:15.316
So if that letter were true,
then why would they try to force

01:11:15.387 --> 01:11:18.720
Roy to leave town?
They'd be throwing money away.

01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:21.623
Furthermore, if he really
wanted to kill himself,

01:11:21.692 --> 01:11:23.684
why would he pack his bags and
go to a motel?

01:11:23.761 --> 01:11:24.660
Maybe he was confused.

01:11:24.728 --> 01:11:28.495
No, he was afraid of
someone, and he ran.

01:11:28.565 --> 01:11:29.726
What are you thinking?

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:32.736
Why did Damon need all that
extra money from Roy and Angela?

01:11:32.803 --> 01:11:35.272
Maybe he was just trying to
scam both of them. I mean he is

01:11:35.339 --> 01:11:36.830
a convict after all.

01:11:36.907 --> 01:11:39.035
I think it's time to put the
fear of God into him.

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:41.302
Okay, great. Alright, let's go.

01:11:41.378 --> 01:11:44.678
No. You stay here. Check in with
I.T. on those account numbers.

01:11:44.748 --> 01:11:46.808
I'll take care of Damon.

01:11:46.884 --> 01:11:50.844
Okay. But if we don't come
up with a Blue Screen, say, by

01:11:50.921 --> 01:11:56.622
the end of the week, we move on
to a new case. Agreed?

01:11:56.694 --> 01:12:00.290
Jack?

01:12:11.375 --> 01:12:12.934
So you say you didn't know
that much about El Corredor,

01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:15.502
huh? Looks to me like you two
have been buddies for quite

01:12:15.579 --> 01:12:16.569
some time.

01:12:16.647 --> 01:12:20.345
Yeah. You're right. We
served together for two years.

01:12:20.417 --> 01:12:21.715
Yeah, well, why don't you
tell me about some of the other

01:12:21.785 --> 01:12:22.878
guys on your cell block.

01:12:22.953 --> 01:12:23.977
What?

01:12:24.054 --> 01:12:26.455
Tell me about Ramirez.
Tell me about Jones.

01:12:26.523 --> 01:12:28.856
There's nothing to tell.
Ramirez is a gang-banger.

01:12:28.926 --> 01:12:32.488
Three-striker. Jones was
falsely convicted. He shouldn't

01:12:32.563 --> 01:12:34.691
even be there, but he won't be
there long.

01:12:34.765 --> 01:12:36.734
There was no one on your
cell block named Ramirez or

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:39.634
Jones, dumbass. I know you
didn't serve any time with

01:12:39.703 --> 01:12:41.695
El Corredor, 'cause you didn't
serve any time.

01:12:41.772 --> 01:12:43.365
Why don't you just cut the
shit and just tell me the truth,

01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:43.940
Damon?

01:12:43.941 --> 01:12:46.740
I can't. You know better than
anybody else that some things

01:12:46.810 --> 01:12:47.577
should never be spoken.

01:12:47.578 --> 01:12:49.877
You knew we were gonna find out
about it anyway.

01:12:49.947 --> 01:12:51.848
Only if you play by the
rules, Jack.

01:12:51.915 --> 01:12:55.044
Jesus Christ, can't you just see
I'm trying to do my job here?!

01:12:55.119 --> 01:12:56.815
What the hell did you do
with all the extra money from

01:12:56.887 --> 01:12:57.820
Roy and Angela?

01:12:57.888 --> 01:13:00.619
Legal fees. After my legal
fees, I only had enough left

01:13:00.691 --> 01:13:01.886
over to get a car.

01:13:01.959 --> 01:13:03.621
You blew $60,000?

01:13:03.694 --> 01:13:07.096
10, Jack. Only 10.

01:13:12.503 --> 01:13:14.472
Kim!

01:13:14.538 --> 01:13:15.104
Kim?

01:13:15.105 --> 01:13:16.403
Kim.

01:13:16.473 --> 01:13:17.006
Who's Kim?

01:13:17.007 --> 01:13:19.602
Roy's secretary. Angela
thinks she transferred you

01:13:19.676 --> 01:13:21.702
50,000. Roy thinks he
transferred you 10.

01:13:21.779 --> 01:13:23.873
You only got 10, right?

01:13:23.947 --> 01:13:25.939
Why would she do that?

01:13:26.016 --> 01:13:27.644
Maybe to protect Roy.

01:13:27.718 --> 01:13:30.517
She probably got in contact
with El Corredor

01:13:30.587 --> 01:13:33.853
through the Sicilians.

01:13:44.435 --> 01:13:47.098
] What are we
waiting for?

01:13:47.171 --> 01:13:49.003
] Right...

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:50.005
] Roy, you don't
think...

01:13:50.073 --> 01:13:54.010
Yeah, I do think. He's my
brother, but I wouldn't put it

01:13:54.077 --> 01:13:57.741
past him. He's got the money and
the motive.

01:13:57.815 --> 01:14:01.809
You know you're starting
to sound like Jack.

01:14:31.014 --> 01:14:32.447
] What do you hope to
find down here, baby?

01:14:32.515 --> 01:14:37.180
I don't know. Answers.

01:14:37.253 --> 01:14:39.984
Why don't you just go
inside and talk to him?

01:14:40.056 --> 01:14:41.854
Okay.

01:14:41.924 --> 01:14:47.056
What? Wait, Roy, I wasn't
being serious.

01:15:09.785 --> 01:15:11.185
What, are y'all here to
join me for dinner?

01:15:11.254 --> 01:15:13.086
] We gotta talk.

01:15:13.155 --> 01:15:15.784
You boys obviously have
some things to sort out.

01:15:15.858 --> 01:15:19.260
I'll be in the señorita's room.

01:15:19.529 --> 01:15:21.259
Why are you here?

01:15:21.531 --> 01:15:22.863
Why are you following me?

01:15:22.932 --> 01:15:24.264
What are you doing down here?
You know you're not supposed to

01:15:24.534 --> 01:15:28.198
be here. Jesus.

01:15:31.107 --> 01:15:34.669
Where's the baño?

01:15:34.744 --> 01:15:38.647
It's around the
corner, to your right.

01:15:39.715 --> 01:15:41.274
] I've thoroughly
enjoyed the rattlesnake.

01:15:41.551 --> 01:15:47.255
Although this is probably the
last time I'm going to eat it.

01:15:50.326 --> 01:15:53.558
I'd like everything finished
within the next 24 hours.

01:15:53.629 --> 01:15:59.093
Sure, I understand. Thank you
for your loyal patronage.

01:16:14.150 --> 01:16:17.712
So what did I miss?

01:16:17.787 --> 01:16:21.189
Hey, babe, I think you're
right. I think it's time for us

01:16:21.257 --> 01:16:23.123
to leave Vegas.

01:16:23.192 --> 01:16:27.755
What? Oh, baby, I'm so
glad. Let's just leave now.

01:16:27.830 --> 01:16:29.696
Thank you for being a pal.

01:16:29.765 --> 01:16:33.861
No problem.

01:16:34.770 --> 01:16:37.899
See you at the Herring.

01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.904
] So what did Damon say?

01:16:39.976 --> 01:16:42.241
What the Hell were you
thinking?

01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.303
Baby, what's wrong?

01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:48.818
Be straight with me! For once
in your life be honest!

01:16:48.884 --> 01:16:51.649
How could you do it?

01:16:51.721 --> 01:16:53.781
Honey, I did it for you.

01:16:53.856 --> 01:16:56.223
Those guys were not gonna
stop... not while they were

01:16:56.292 --> 01:16:57.021
still alive.

01:16:57.093 --> 01:16:59.324
But they got the message.
They got the message after

01:16:59.395 --> 01:17:00.363
Wilkinson and after Kyusovich.

01:17:00.630 --> 01:17:03.065
But, Ange, why did you have
to kill Chaise and Quarrie?

01:17:03.132 --> 01:17:04.225
They had families!

01:17:04.300 --> 01:17:07.802
Let's just move past this, okay?
They're not in our lives any more.

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:11.363
They can't get to you.
It's just you and me now.

01:17:11.641 --> 01:17:17.172
How much were they? What's a
human life go for these days?

01:17:19.281 --> 01:17:21.216
10,000 each.

01:17:21.283 --> 01:17:25.778
Then why was it 50, not 40?

01:17:26.389 --> 01:17:28.358
I had to pay for one more
job to get some things

01:17:28.424 --> 01:17:32.122
cleaned up.

01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:34.993
You're going to have him
kill Jack!?

01:17:35.064 --> 01:17:38.728
What? No! God! Just trust
me... you don't want to know who

01:17:38.801 --> 01:17:44.798
the last target is. Baby, let's
just go. Let's sell the house.

01:17:44.874 --> 01:17:46.968
Let's get out of here.

01:17:47.043 --> 01:17:52.106
I don't know. I feel like I
don't even know you.

01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:57.118
I love you, Roy. I love
you. Can't you see that?

01:17:57.185 --> 01:18:02.355
I am going to need some time
with all this.

01:18:05.427 --> 01:18:10.427
Okay. Okay, I understand.
How about two weeks?

01:18:14.703 --> 01:18:16.035
And if I'm not ready by then,
what, are you going to

01:18:16.104 --> 01:18:18.266
have me whacked?

01:18:18.339 --> 01:18:24.041
Come on, baby. Who's my
howling monkey?

01:18:25.880 --> 01:18:31.810
So. What was Damon's connection
was to this whole thing?

01:18:33.221 --> 01:18:38.459
He told me how to find El
Corredor. Are you satisfied now?

01:18:47.102 --> 01:18:49.833
Yeah.

01:19:12.327 --> 01:19:17.394
Pinche, gringo. You're
developing quite a reputation.

01:19:20.468 --> 01:19:25.897
Do you like the "mi
arte de la semana?"

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:31.970
You gonna sit down? Or is this
an official work visit?

01:19:32.046 --> 01:19:35.380
Give me something.

01:19:38.253 --> 01:19:41.314
Okay.

01:19:55.403 --> 01:19:58.840
The mission of the
Vegas PD is to protect the community

01:19:58.907 --> 01:20:04.039
through prevention, partnership
and professional service...

01:20:04.112 --> 01:20:07.514
The acronym "I CARE" is the
guiding principle for each and

01:20:07.582 --> 01:20:11.280
every Vegas PD employee.
This acronym represents the

01:20:11.352 --> 01:20:16.222
values of the Las Vegas Police
Integrity, Courage,

01:20:16.291 --> 01:20:20.558
Accountability, Respect for
People, and Excellence.

01:20:20.829 --> 01:20:23.924
The values are supported by
behaviors demonstrated by the

01:20:23.998 --> 01:20:27.059
actions of employees as they
live these values.

01:20:27.135 --> 01:20:29.400
All employees are expected
to represent the values of the

01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:33.407
Department while in the
workplace and off-duty.

01:20:33.474 --> 01:20:38.105
This is Vegas PD's Oath.

01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:49.357
This is the last
job from this particular employer,

01:20:49.424 --> 01:20:55.331
but you only have 24 hours.
The employer is

01:20:56.397 --> 01:21:02.098
extremely satisfied with your
work, and there's more employers

01:21:02.170 --> 01:21:07.509
that are in need of your
services.

01:21:18.185 --> 01:21:21.952
You know this guy?

01:21:57.357 --> 01:22:01.556
You know the first animal I
ever killed was a squirrel.

01:22:01.628 --> 01:22:04.462
I accidentally ran over it with
my parents' minivan.

01:22:04.531 --> 01:22:09.060
I really did try to avoid it.
When I felt it go under the

01:22:09.136 --> 01:22:13.597
tires, I slammed on the breaks.
I looked out the rear view

01:22:13.674 --> 01:22:19.103
mirror and saw him twitching and
jerking. Much like you are right

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:24.345
now. I stepped out with a
gas can, ready to put it out of

01:22:24.418 --> 01:22:28.321
its misery.

01:22:28.689 --> 01:22:34.392
But as I got closer, ooh, I
was fascinated.

01:22:36.463 --> 01:22:38.523
This creature was trying to
keep its soul from being ripped

01:22:38.598 --> 01:22:44.232
from its body. There was so much
emotion going through this thing

01:22:45.305 --> 01:22:50.608
because it knew that it would
never live again.

01:22:50.677 --> 01:22:56.311
All it wanted was just one
more day, just one minute, to

01:22:57.384 --> 01:23:01.082
enjoy its life on this Earth.
And you know what it could

01:23:01.154 --> 01:23:07.152
think about? That it's one life
was about to end.

01:23:10.564 --> 01:23:13.432
What are you thinking about?

01:23:23.243 --> 01:23:26.680
Well, after that, I swore to
God that I would never kill

01:23:26.747 --> 01:23:29.046
anything again.

01:23:32.019 --> 01:23:37.119
But every day that went by,
ooh, that hunger grew...

01:23:39.192 --> 01:23:44.393
The hunger to see that
struggle to live.

01:23:45.465 --> 01:23:50.768
You see I don't like what I
have to do... but I am

01:23:51.038 --> 01:23:56.642
fascinated by it.

01:23:57.677 --> 01:24:02.706
Lo siento, mi
amigo.

01:25:24.797 --> 01:25:27.824
] Well, well, well, Jack!

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:29.562
Nice of you to join us.

01:25:29.635 --> 01:25:31.399
Nice to see your
work ethic still supersedes

01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:32.494
your punctuality.

01:25:32.571 --> 01:25:34.631
Sorry I'm late.

01:25:34.707 --> 01:25:37.836
So, we're toasting to life,
liberty, and the pursuit of

01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:39.276
happiness.

01:25:39.345 --> 01:25:40.472
] You mean "Property. "

01:25:40.546 --> 01:25:41.570
] What?

01:25:41.647 --> 01:25:43.513
Well, the phrase in the Bill
of Rights actually reads "nor...

01:25:43.582 --> 01:25:47.519
shall any person be deprived of
life, liberty, or property. "

01:25:47.853 --> 01:25:48.786
What?

01:25:48.854 --> 01:25:51.449
Always by the book, Jack, huh?

01:25:51.524 --> 01:25:55.291
Always.

01:25:55.361 --> 01:26:01.360
It's nice to see the old
gang together again.

01:26:18.184 --> 01:26:22.246
It's nice to see the old
gang together again.
