WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.834
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
KNOW HOW THINGS
ARE GONNA TURN OUT.

00:03.834 --> 00:06.041
VERY TRUE, POTTER.

00:06.041 --> 00:08.000
I MEAN,
WHO WOULD'VE THOUGHT
THAT I'D ACTUALLY

00:08.000 --> 00:10.917
BE ABLE TO USE
THOSE DANCE LESSONS?

00:10.917 --> 00:12.583
THERE'S GONNA BE DANCING
AT THIS THING?

00:12.583 --> 00:13.625
YEAH.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID IT WAS JUST

00:13.625 --> 00:15.708
SELF-CONGRATULATORY
AWARD-GIVING.

00:15.708 --> 00:17.166
THIS IS A BIG DEAL.

00:17.166 --> 00:18.708
A.J.'S GOING TO BE
READING HIS WORK

00:18.708 --> 00:21.166
IN FRONT OF SEVERAL
VERY IMPORTANT ALUMNI.

00:21.166 --> 00:23.417
HE'S THE YOUNGEST PERSON
IN HIS DEPARTMENT TO WIN--

00:23.417 --> 00:26.000
CREATIVE VITING
AWARD?

00:26.000 --> 00:27.500
CREATIVE WRITING.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.500
YEAH, I'LL SAY.

00:28.500 --> 00:29.500
IT'S CALLIGRAPHY.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.417
IT'S PRETENTIOUS.

00:31.875 --> 00:33.458
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T MIND ME.

00:33.458 --> 00:35.583
JUST HAVE
A GOOD TIME
THIS WEEKEND.

00:35.583 --> 00:37.000
I WILL.

00:37.000 --> 00:37.125
I MEAN...

00:38.375 --> 00:41.291
THIS COULD BE
THE MOST ROMANTIC NIGHT
OF MY LIFE.

00:41.291 --> 00:44.500
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVERY DAY
THAT I GET IN--INVITED

00:44.500 --> 00:47.542
TO ELEGANT DINNERS
WITH DISTINGUISHED GUESTS

00:47.542 --> 00:49.083
ACCOMPANIED BY A FRIEND WHO--

00:49.083 --> 00:50.041
FRIEND?

00:50.041 --> 00:51.417
IS THAT WHAT
YOU AND A.J. ARE?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.166
UH, A.J. AND I ARE...

00:56.542 --> 00:59.750
IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS
WHAT A.J. AND I ARE.

00:59.750 --> 01:03.333
A.J. AND YOU ARE
FRIENDS WHO KISS.

01:03.333 --> 01:04.500
OH...

01:04.500 --> 01:07.083
PACEY, LOOK...

01:07.083 --> 01:09.750
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS
DON'T NECESSARILY FOLLOW

01:09.750 --> 01:13.125
THE SAME RULES
AND DEFINITIONS
AS REGULAR RELATIONSHIPS.

01:13.125 --> 01:16.166
NO, THEY DON'T.
AND THAT'S WHY
THEY'RE PERFECT FOR YOU.

01:16.166 --> 01:18.417
'CAUSE THEY'RE NOT REAL.

01:18.417 --> 01:20.458
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

01:21.667 --> 01:23.291
DON'T YOU SEE?

01:23.291 --> 01:24.917
LITTLE
SCRUBBER GIRL, JOEY,

01:24.917 --> 01:26.333
GETS TO
PUT ON A PRETTY DRESS

01:26.333 --> 01:27.583
AND GO TO THE BALL
WITH COLLEGE PRINCE
CHARMING.

01:27.583 --> 01:30.375
THAT'S NOT REAL.
IT'S A FAIRY TALE.

01:30.375 --> 01:32.291
SAY WHAT YOU WILL,
BUT FAIRY TALE
OR NOT...

01:32.291 --> 01:35.000
I STILL FEEL
WHAT I FEEL, PACEY.

01:35.000 --> 01:38.500
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,
ALL YOU HAVE HERE
IS AN EYES-CLOSED WISH.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.041
SOMETIMES
WISHES COME TRUE.

01:42.041 --> 01:44.166
YES, SOMETIMES
WISHES DO COME TRUE.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.792
SOMETIMES EVEN
IN UNEXPECTED PLACES.

01:46.792 --> 01:49.959
BUT REALITY ALWAYS FINDS A WAY
OF CREEPING BACK IN, JO.

01:49.959 --> 01:51.542
CLOCK INEVITABLY
STRIKES MIDNIGHT.

01:51.542 --> 01:52.875
THEN IT'S PUMPKIN CITY.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.542
THE FANTASY FADES.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.917
TRY TO HAVE
A GOOD WEEKEND,
PACEY.

02:00.000 --> 02:01.917
THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

02:01.917 --> 02:03.583
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.875
WE COULD HAVE
A WINNER HERE.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.250
I REALLY HOPE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.708
WHY? JUST BECAUSE
MY RESTAURANT OPENS
IN LESS THAN A WEEK,

03:13.708 --> 03:15.041
AND I STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND A CHEF?

03:15.041 --> 03:17.333
OR WAITERS.
OR...MENUS.

03:17.333 --> 03:19.834
WHAT? THE MENUS
STILL HAVEN'T ARRIVED
FROM THE PRINTERS?

03:19.834 --> 03:21.166
WE SENT THEM BACK
YESTERDAY, REMEMBER?

03:21.166 --> 03:24.125
WE SAID $2,200
WAS A LITTLE PRICEY
FOR SCAMPI.

03:24.125 --> 03:26.792
RIGHT. YOU JUST
KEEP SCREENING APPLICANTS
FOR MY WAITSTAFF.

03:26.792 --> 03:30.041
HOPEFULLY, WE HAVE, UH,
FOUND OUR KITCHEN TALENT.

03:30.041 --> 03:31.500
THE CHOWDER SMELLS AMAZING.

03:33.708 --> 03:34.708
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:34.708 --> 03:36.083
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
FINE FOOD,

03:36.083 --> 03:38.208
BUT I KNOW ENOUGH
TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS...SUCKS.

03:39.708 --> 03:42.208
ARE YOU SURE THAT WE DON'T WANT
TO STEAL BODIE FROM THE POTTERS?

03:42.208 --> 03:44.291
NOT UNLESS
WE DECIDE THAT
BESSIE AND ALEXANDER

03:44.291 --> 03:46.291
DON'T NEED A HOME
AND I DON'T NEED
JOEY AS A FRIEND.

03:46.291 --> 03:48.625
CHOWDER ISN'T EASY
TO MASTER.

03:48.625 --> 03:50.000
HERE, TRY HIS
BREADED MONKFISH.

03:50.000 --> 03:50.875
IT LOOKS GREAT.

03:50.875 --> 03:52.708
I GOTTA GET OFF
TO THE PRINTER.

03:52.708 --> 03:54.458
OH, AND, HONEY,
DON'T WORRY.

03:54.458 --> 03:56.333
EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

03:58.917 --> 04:02.542
HEY!
HEY!

04:02.542 --> 04:05.208
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR PICKING UP THE SIGN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

04:05.208 --> 04:08.333
YEAH, WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THIS MAY EXACERBATE
THE INSANITY.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.542
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU WANNA KEEP
THE PLACE A SECRET.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.583
WHAT HAPPENED?
WELL, THE GUY TOLD YOUR MOM

04:12.583 --> 04:13.917
HE HAD TO HAVE
A NAME BY TODAY.

04:13.917 --> 04:14.917
HE'S ALREADY GOT
ANOTHER JOB.

04:14.917 --> 04:17.250
I THOUGHT IT WAS
THE FISH BISTRO.

04:17.250 --> 04:19.375
DAWSON, A WOMAN
HAS THE RIGHT
TO CHANGE HER MIND.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.750
NOT THIS LATE
IN THE GAME.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.166
WELL, UH...

04:22.166 --> 04:24.083
OK, SO THE RESTAURANT
COULD BE LIKE
ONE OF THOSE

04:24.083 --> 04:25.542
HIP NO-NAME CLUBS.

04:25.542 --> 04:26.959
YOU KNOW, TOO COOL
TO HAVE A NAME.

04:26.959 --> 04:28.375
EXCUSE, PLEASE.

04:28.375 --> 04:30.250
I LOOK FOR
RESTAURANT OF FISH.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.250
I HAVE TRYING OUT
FOR CHOWDER MAN.

04:32.250 --> 04:33.917
YOU GUYS HUNGRY?

04:34.542 --> 04:36.250
SO WHO IS THIS KID

04:36.250 --> 04:37.583
WORTHY OF BEING
A WITTER MENTEE?

04:37.583 --> 04:39.417
SOMEONE YOUR SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATION AND I

04:39.417 --> 04:40.875
THOUGHT WOULD BE
APPROPRIATE.

04:40.875 --> 04:44.125
HOW EXACTLY
DO YOU GUYS GO ABOUT
MAKING THAT DETERMINATION?

04:44.125 --> 04:46.875
YOU'LL SEE.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.208
UH, IF THERE
ARE ANY PROBLEMS,

04:48.208 --> 04:50.417
I CAN ALWAYS
ASSIGN YOU
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

04:50.417 --> 04:54.041
I THINK I'LL PROBABLY
BE ABLE TO HANDLE
A 9-YEAR-OLD, THANKS.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.875
BUZZ THOMPSON MEET
PACEY WITTER.

05:03.959 --> 05:06.458
HEY.
HOW YOU DOIN', KID?

05:06.458 --> 05:08.166
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:08.166 --> 05:10.250
16. HOW OLD ARE YOU?

05:10.250 --> 05:12.875
YOU HAVE 5:00 SHADOW.

05:12.875 --> 05:14.208
WELL, I'M MATURE.

05:14.208 --> 05:18.208
IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL IT?

05:18.750 --> 05:20.291
HEH, HEH...

05:20.291 --> 05:23.500
I GET IT.
YOU'RE A SMART ASS.

05:23.500 --> 05:24.959
THAT'S WHY THEY
PUT US TOGETHER.

05:24.959 --> 05:27.291
PEOPLE THINK I'M
A SMART ASS, TOO.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.959
BUT WHEN THEY
REALLY GET TO KNOW YOU,

05:28.959 --> 05:32.083
THEY DISCOVER,
UNDER THE GRUFF EXTERIOR,

05:32.083 --> 05:35.834
LIES A VULNERABLE,
BEATING HEART.

05:35.834 --> 05:39.500
GET REAL! I'M NOT LIKE
ONE OF THOSE KIDS
ON SEVENTH HEAVEN,

05:39.500 --> 05:41.000
AND I'M NOT LIKE YOU.
PISSY!

05:41.000 --> 05:43.083
PACEY.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.458
WHATEVER, PISSY.

05:44.458 --> 05:47.291
PACEY. AND YOU DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT ME, KID.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.333
I KNOW YOU THINK
YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE,

05:49.333 --> 05:52.250
BUT YOU'RE JUST DYING
TO THROW YOUR ARM AROUND ME

05:52.250 --> 05:54.000
AND HAVE A WARM AND FUZZY.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.125
WELL, DON'T BOTHER,

05:55.125 --> 05:56.417
'CAUSE YOU'RE GONNA
BE BACK HERE

05:56.417 --> 05:57.458
TRYING TO
GET RID OF ME.

05:57.458 --> 06:01.291
I GIVE YOU 48 HOURS.
KID!

06:33.375 --> 06:35.542
HI, I'M--
I'M JOEY POTTER.

06:35.542 --> 06:36.875
OF COURSE YOU ARE.

06:36.875 --> 06:37.875
AND YOU ARE...

06:37.875 --> 06:39.583
I'M MORGAN.

06:39.583 --> 06:41.708
I'M A.J.'S
OLDEST FRIEND.

06:41.708 --> 06:42.708
OH.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.500
WHERE'S A.J.?

06:45.500 --> 06:47.250
THE JUMPY-BOY
IS STILL TRYING
TO DECIDE

06:47.250 --> 06:48.625
ON WHAT TO READ
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.041
WHY DO I FEEL LIKE
I FELL ASLEEP ON THE TRAIN

06:52.041 --> 06:54.834
AND SUDDENLY WOKE UP
THE PROTAGONIST
IN A KAFKA STORY?

06:54.834 --> 06:57.875
WELL, THERE'S THE WIT.
JUST LIKE HE SAID.

06:57.875 --> 06:58.583
THE WIT?

06:58.583 --> 06:59.667
THE FAMOUS
POTTER WIT.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.959
HE'S TOLD ME
ALL ABOUT YOU.

07:02.959 --> 07:04.500
ARTIST, POLITICAL
AGITATOR...

07:04.500 --> 07:06.750
OH, AND, UH,
SIZE-8 FOOT.

07:06.750 --> 07:08.917
PUT THESE ON.
WE'RE GONNA
GO BLADING.

07:10.083 --> 07:13.333
THANKS.

07:13.333 --> 07:14.667
Buzz: IS THIS
THE FUN PART?

07:14.667 --> 07:17.542
IS THIS THE PART
WHERE WE'RE HAVING FUN?

07:17.542 --> 07:21.000
OR DID I BLINK
AND MISS IT?

07:21.000 --> 07:23.792
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT ME, MAN.
I DON'T WANNA BE HERE
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

07:23.792 --> 07:27.208
I GOT STUCK WITH YOU.
BUT THIS STILL DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE SO HORRIBLE.

07:27.208 --> 07:29.750
HERE COMES THE HONESTY.
NEXT IS THE INTIMACY.

07:31.875 --> 07:33.375
WHAT EXACTLY
DO YOU WANT?

07:33.375 --> 07:35.166
LET ME MAKE THIS
EASY FOR YOU.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.959
READ MY LIPS.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.625
PIKACHU.

07:39.625 --> 07:43.166
YOU WANT SOMETHING
THAT HAS TO BE TREATED
WITH ANTIBIOTICS.

07:43.166 --> 07:45.166
MAN, YOUR GENERATION
IS SO OUT OF IT.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.291
POKÃ‰MON, YOU PUTZ.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.625
I KNEW THAT.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.166
I GOT ALAKAZAM
THROUGH METAPOD,

07:49.166 --> 07:50.500
BUT I'M IN SERIOUS NEED
OF A POLIWRATH.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.333
THERE'S A VENDOR
RIGHT OVER THERE.

07:53.333 --> 07:54.542
YOU GOTTA BE
KIDDIN' ME, MAN.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.291
THERE'S NO WAY
I'M SPENDING 20 BUCKS

07:56.291 --> 07:57.542
ON A JAPANESE
TRADING CARD.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.125
YOU HAVE A SERIOUS
PROBLEM WITH ANGER.

07:59.125 --> 08:01.000
I HOPE THE CAPESIDE
MENTORING PROGRAM

08:01.000 --> 08:01.625
KNOWS WHO
I'M DEALING WITH HERE.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.667
OK. IF I BUY YOU
THE STUPID CARD,

08:08.667 --> 08:10.458
WOULD YOU SHUT UP
FOR 2 SECONDS, PLEASE?

08:10.458 --> 08:11.625
OK.

08:11.625 --> 08:15.166
HERE, TAKE THESE
AND GO WHACK SOME MOLES

08:15.166 --> 08:16.208
AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE
WHILE I'M GONE. MAN.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.125
WHATEVER, PISSY.

08:19.125 --> 08:19.625
Buzz: YOU GUYS PLAYING?

08:19.625 --> 08:21.375
Kid: STEP ASIDE.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.375
Kid: GET OUT OF HERE!

08:23.375 --> 08:26.375
HEY! HEY, HEY, HEY!
WHAT THE HELL'S
GOIN' ON OVER HERE?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.625
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:28.625 --> 08:30.166
HE HIT ME IN THE HEAD
WITH THE MALLET.

08:30.166 --> 08:32.041
POPPED ME
RIGHT ON THE NOSE!

08:32.041 --> 08:33.958
THEY TRIED TO PUSH ME
OFF MY GAME!

08:33.958 --> 08:36.082
OK, THAT'S IT.
YOU'RE DONE.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.250
NO MORE DECISIONS
FOR YOU.

08:37.250 --> 08:38.750
NOW WE DO SOMETHING
I THINK IS FUN.

08:38.750 --> 08:38.833
OW!

08:42.166 --> 08:44.500
HEY.

08:44.500 --> 08:45.792
HEY!

08:45.792 --> 08:46.959
WHERE'S JOEY?

08:46.959 --> 08:48.667
I SHOWED HER AROUND TOWN,
LIKE YOU ASKED.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.041
YOU DIDN'T...

08:50.041 --> 08:51.875
YOU DID.

08:51.875 --> 08:54.375
JOEY, HEY.
IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

08:54.375 --> 08:55.375
HEY. YOU, TOO.

08:55.375 --> 08:56.500
HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?

08:56.500 --> 08:56.750
UH...

08:57.333 --> 08:59.792
IT WAS A TRIP.

08:59.792 --> 09:01.792
I'M--I'M SO SORRY
I WASN'T THERE
TO MEET YOU.

09:01.792 --> 09:03.834
I STILL HAVEN'T
PICKED A READING
FOR TOMORROW.

09:04.417 --> 09:05.250
DO YOU HATE ME?

09:05.250 --> 09:07.583
COMPLETELY.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.917
HI.

09:11.834 --> 09:15.166
OH, GOOD GOD.
GET A ROOM.

09:16.208 --> 09:19.083
I HOPE SHE DIDN'T
TOTALLY WEAR YOU OUT.

09:19.083 --> 09:22.208
NO, IT WAS--
IT WAS ACTUALLY
VERY INFORMATIVE.

09:22.208 --> 09:23.875
I HAD NO IDEA THAT
THE CHARLES RIVER

09:23.875 --> 09:25.291
RAN THROUGH SO MUCH
OF THE CITY.

09:25.291 --> 09:27.125
YOU TOOK HER ON
THE CHARLES RIVER CIRCUIT?

09:27.125 --> 09:28.291
SHE DID BETTER THAN YOU.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.375
OH, I'M SORRY.
I ASKED HER
TO PICK YOU UP,

09:30.375 --> 09:31.917
NOT TAKE YOU
ON AN ENDURANCE TEST.

09:31.917 --> 09:33.083
OH, YOU'RE THREATENED!

09:33.083 --> 09:34.500
HE CAN'T BLADE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE,

09:34.500 --> 09:36.625
AND IF ANY TIME A GIRL
SHOWS GREATER SKILL
THAN HIM,

09:36.625 --> 09:37.041
HE GETS
TOTALLY THREATENED.

09:37.041 --> 09:39.208
WHAT?

09:39.208 --> 09:41.291
HOW LONG
HAVE YOU GUYS
KNOWN EACH OTHER?

09:41.291 --> 09:43.083
PRETTY MUCH SINCE
WE WERE ZYGOTES.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.417
MORGAN AND I
GREW UP TOGETHER.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.542
SAME TOWN,
SAME HIGH SCHOOL--

09:46.542 --> 09:48.208
SAME COLLEGE?

09:48.208 --> 09:49.708
ACTUALLY, I GOT BORED
WITH THIS GEEK,

09:49.708 --> 09:51.500
AND I DECIDED TO MAKE
SOME NEW FRIENDS.

09:51.500 --> 09:54.125
SO I WENT TO SCHOOL
LAST SEMESTER AT SORBONNE.

09:55.333 --> 09:58.667
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO STUDY IN PARIS.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.583
PLUS TARD, JE TE DIRAI
TOUS CES FAIBLESSES.

10:00.583 --> 10:02.333
PAS SI JE PEUX T'EMPÃ‰CHER.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.708
SORRY. MY FRENCH
ISN'T VERY GOOD.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.291
OH, MORGAN LIKES
TO EMBARRASS ME,

10:07.291 --> 10:09.583
SO I'M NOT LETTING YOU TWO
HANG OUT TOGETHER ANYMORE.

10:09.583 --> 10:11.083
HMM. SEE? THREATENED.

10:11.083 --> 10:13.458
DON'T LET THE FRIENDLY
BANTER FOOL YOU, JOEY.

10:13.458 --> 10:15.291
WE REALLY
CAN'T STAND EACH OTHER.

10:15.291 --> 10:18.000
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
ALL HE WROTE ABOUT
IN HIS LETTERS TO ME.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.000
REALLY?

10:22.250 --> 10:24.750
I'LL BET HE NEVER TOLD YOU
A THING ABOUT ME.

10:26.417 --> 10:29.750
YEAH, WELL, I CAN SEE
THAT YOU TWO NEED
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

10:32.875 --> 10:33.959
THANK YOU.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.083
AT LEAST
YOU CAN TAKE A HINT.

10:36.083 --> 10:37.792
JOEY, I'M GLAD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.000
I WAS
BEGINNING TO THINK

10:39.000 --> 10:41.125
THAT YOU MIGHT BE
ONE OF HIS FANTASIES.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.750
NO. SHE'S REAL.
I TOLD YOU.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.375
FLESH AND BLOOD.

10:45.708 --> 10:49.125
THAT'S ME.
JOEY POTTER,
FLESH AND BLOOD.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.083
OK, HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.
THIS GUY SAYS

10:58.083 --> 11:01.166
HIS SPANISH MACKEREL
QUICHE IS WORLD FAMOUS.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.625
DOES ANYBODY
HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT THAT IS?

11:02.625 --> 11:03.792
YOU DON'T
WANT TO KNOW.

11:03.792 --> 11:06.875
THE LADY WHO DID
THE COD FLAMBÃ‰...

11:06.875 --> 11:08.041
THAT WAS MY FAVORITE.

11:08.041 --> 11:09.417
YEAH, SHE WAS A GEM--
HUH.

11:09.417 --> 11:10.834
YOU SHOULD SEE
THE KITCHEN CEILING,

11:10.834 --> 11:12.708
IT'S COVERED
IN TINY BURNT
FISH BONES.

11:12.708 --> 11:14.458
YEAH, YOUR MOM NEEDS
SOME SERIOUS HELP, MAN.

11:14.458 --> 11:15.417
I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT ROCK

11:15.417 --> 11:16.375
THESE PEOPLE HAVE
BEEN COOKING UNDER.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.250
HI, GUYS.

11:18.250 --> 11:19.333
HEY!

11:19.333 --> 11:20.333
HEY, JEN.

11:20.333 --> 11:21.500
YOU. I KNOW YOU.

11:21.500 --> 11:23.625
YOU--YOU
WERE AT A RALLY,

11:23.625 --> 11:24.625
RIGHT? NO!
OR WAS IT THE, UM...

11:24.625 --> 11:27.083
THE HACKY SACK
CIRCLE AT CAPEFEST?

11:27.083 --> 11:28.667
VERY FUNNY, YEAH.

11:28.667 --> 11:30.041
I KNOW, I'VE BEEN
A LITTLE OUT OF
CIRCULATION LATELY.

11:30.041 --> 11:32.542
SPENDING
MOST OF MY TIME
WITH HENRY.

11:32.542 --> 11:33.333
OOH!

11:33.333 --> 11:35.083
THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

11:35.083 --> 11:36.333
I THINK THERE'S
A 6-WEEK HONEYMOON PERIOD

11:36.333 --> 11:39.417
YOU GO THROUGH WHENEVER YOU
GET INTO A NEW RELATIONSHIP.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.125
WELL, YEAH, BUT THEN
YOU WAKE UP ONE DAY,

11:41.125 --> 11:42.917
YOU REALIZE YOU'VE
GOT THE RELATIONSHIP
BUT NOT MUCH ELSE.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.625
IF YOU'RE
IN NEED OF SUSTENANCE,

11:46.625 --> 11:47.708
YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.500
ACTUALLY, I WAS--
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

11:49.500 --> 11:50.875
SERVING SAID SUSTENANCE.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.458
JEN LINDLEY
WANTS TO BE A WAITRESS?

11:53.458 --> 11:54.875
YEAH. I THINK
IT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY

11:54.875 --> 11:56.000
FOR ME TO MEET
NEW PEOPLE.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.500
I--I COULD EARN
ENOUGH TIP MONEY

11:57.500 --> 11:58.583
TO OCCASIONALLY
TAKE HENRY OUT...

11:58.583 --> 12:00.708
I'M TIRED
OF LIVING OFF MY GRAMS.

12:00.708 --> 12:02.417
OK. UH, WELL...

12:02.417 --> 12:05.041
AS YOU CAN SEE,
MY MOM IS IN IMMEDIATE
NEED OF ASSISTANCE--

12:05.041 --> 12:06.375
[CRASH]

12:07.041 --> 12:09.417
HOW SOON CAN YOU START?

12:14.875 --> 12:17.208
CAN YOU BELIEVE
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

12:17.208 --> 12:18.959
TO DECIDE ON A READING
FOR TOMORROW?

12:18.959 --> 12:21.792
I MEAN, IT'S ONLY
THE MOST IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY
OF MY LIFETIME.

12:21.792 --> 12:23.166
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?

12:23.166 --> 12:24.750
SHE'S PRETTY.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.208
WHO?

12:26.208 --> 12:27.417
MORGAN.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.458
SHE'S REALLY PRETTY
AND...

12:29.458 --> 12:30.542
SO SMART.

12:30.542 --> 12:32.375
YEAH.
REAL SMART.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.417
OW.

12:33.417 --> 12:35.542
SORRY.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.291
A.J., WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT HER?

12:41.083 --> 12:44.000
I--I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS WE HAVE
SO LITTLE TIME TOGETHER,

12:44.000 --> 12:45.375
I JUST FIGURE
I'D CONCENTRATE
ON THE BIG THINGS.

12:45.375 --> 12:48.041
YOU DON'T THINK
ONE OF YOUR OLDEST
FRIENDS

12:48.041 --> 12:50.333
IS A BIG ENOUGH
THING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME ABOUT?

12:50.333 --> 12:52.041
YEAH...

12:52.041 --> 12:54.500
BUT, I MEAN, HOW MUCH
DO YOU TALK TO ME
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS?

12:56.417 --> 12:58.000
I GUESS
YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.125
SO...I'M TRYING
TO DECIDE ON--
ON SOMETHING I DID

13:00.125 --> 13:04.125
MORE RECENTLY OR MAYBE
ONE OF MY OLDER PIECES,
I DON'T KNOW.

13:04.125 --> 13:06.500
DID YOU TWO EVER...
DATE?

13:07.959 --> 13:11.583
JOEY, LOOK...
I PROMISE YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.917
OW.

13:12.917 --> 13:14.834
I'M SORRY.
DAMN THIS STUFF.
BUT...

13:14.834 --> 13:16.625
I WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT NO FOREIGN ELEMENTS

13:16.625 --> 13:18.041
GET INTRODUCED
TO YOUR HEMOGLOBIN,

13:18.041 --> 13:19.750
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE PART OF THE BLOOD

13:19.750 --> 13:21.375
THAT TRANSPORTS--
I KNOW WHAT THAT IS.

13:23.458 --> 13:24.792
SORRY.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.166
YOU KNOW, I--I, UH...

13:28.166 --> 13:30.458
I KNOW SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT WORK
BETTER THAN THIS.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.458
IS IT BETTER?

13:43.041 --> 13:44.291
WELL, UM...

13:44.291 --> 13:47.875
SEE, NOW I'M FEELING
A LITTLE LIGHTHEADED.

13:47.875 --> 13:48.959
REALLY?

13:48.959 --> 13:50.583
YEAH, I DON'T--
I DON'T THINK

13:50.583 --> 13:53.625
MY HEMOGLOBIN
IS TRANSPORTING ENOUGH
OXYGEN THROUGH MY BODY.

13:53.625 --> 13:55.041
OH...

13:55.041 --> 13:57.750
THAT COULD BE A PROBLEM.

14:04.583 --> 14:06.500
I WAS THINKING...OH.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.166
I GUESS YOU GUYS
GOT THAT ROOM.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.959
NO, WAIT.
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING?

14:09.959 --> 14:12.333
I WAS THINKING, ARTHUR.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.083
YOU KNOW, GO WITH
THE NATURE OF LOVE
PIECE.

14:14.083 --> 14:16.583
YOU DON'T THINK
IT'S OLD?
ARTHUR?

14:16.583 --> 14:17.959
THEY ALREADY KNOW
YOUR NEW STUFF.

14:17.959 --> 14:19.625
THEY WANNA KNOW
WHERE IT COMES FROM.

14:19.625 --> 14:21.625
I SAY BE HONEST
AND SHOW THEM
YOUR ROOTS.

14:21.625 --> 14:22.917
YEAH. YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:22.917 --> 14:24.834
YEAH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

14:24.834 --> 14:27.834
WHAT'S UP WITH
THE DOUBLE-BREASTED
JACKET AND THE REP TIE?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.500
YOU WIN AN AWARD,
AND SUDDENLY YOU TURN
RALPH LAUREN ON US?

14:29.500 --> 14:32.333
NO, I--I JUST WANT
TO LOOK RESPECTABLE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

14:32.333 --> 14:35.083
IT'LL TAKE
A LOT MORE THAN
A BORING JACKET.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.583
WHY NOT JUST BE YOURSELF?

14:36.583 --> 14:39.125
YOU KNOW, KHAKIS,
SWEATER, LOAFERS?
THAT'S YOU.

14:39.125 --> 14:40.542
OH, AND I HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

14:40.542 --> 14:42.667
OH...BYE.

14:43.875 --> 14:45.583
WHO'S ARTHUR?

14:49.250 --> 14:50.542
YOU CAN'T
MAKE ME DO THIS.

14:50.542 --> 14:51.542
THE HELL I CAN.

14:51.542 --> 14:54.125
THIS IS SLAVE LABOR.

14:54.125 --> 14:56.500
CAN YOU DO ANYTHING
BESIDES WHINE, KID?

14:56.500 --> 14:58.375
I CAN WRITE LETTERS.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.792
YOU COULD PAINT.

14:59.792 --> 15:01.667
WATCH AND LEARN,
ALL RIGHT?

15:01.667 --> 15:02.500
IT'S UP,
AND THEN DOWN.

15:02.500 --> 15:03.959
AND THEN UP,
AND THEN DOWN.

15:03.959 --> 15:04.875
YOU GOT IT?

15:04.875 --> 15:07.000
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
THE EXPRESSION,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.792
DON'T GO
AGAINST THE GRAIN?

15:13.375 --> 15:15.458
WHO ON EARTH
GOT YOU TO SIT STILL
LONG ENOUGH

15:15.458 --> 15:16.417
TO TEACH YOU
HOW TO PAINT?

15:16.417 --> 15:17.875
MY DAD.

15:17.875 --> 15:18.750
REALLY?

15:18.750 --> 15:19.959
WHERE IS YOUR DAD NOW?

15:19.959 --> 15:23.000
SOMEWHERE
IN THE ATLANTIC.

15:23.000 --> 15:23.542
OH, YEAH?
YOUR DAD'S A SAILOR?

15:23.542 --> 15:24.542
NOPE.

15:24.542 --> 15:26.667
FISH FOOD.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.959
SCATTERED HIS ASHES
OFF NANTUCKET.

15:29.583 --> 15:31.542
OH.

15:31.542 --> 15:33.375
WHERE'S YOURS?

15:33.375 --> 15:34.708
UH, MY DAD?

15:34.708 --> 15:38.041
HE'S PROBABLY
HANGING UP HIS HOLSTER
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

15:38.041 --> 15:39.458
A COP!

15:39.458 --> 15:41.500
THAT EXPLAINS
YOUR AUTHORITY
ISSUES.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.083
I DON'T HAVE
AUTHORITY ISSUES.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.834
ISSUES,
ISSUES, ISSUES.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.250
I DON'T HAVE ISSUES, OK?

15:46.250 --> 15:47.959
LOOK HOW YOU
HANDLED ME
AT THE ARCADE.

15:47.959 --> 15:49.250
YOU GOT INTO A FIGHT.

15:49.250 --> 15:50.625
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LEARN
THAT THERE ARE BETTER WAYS

15:50.625 --> 15:52.750
TO HANDLE CONFRONTATIONS

15:52.750 --> 15:54.250
THAN PLAYING WHACK-A-KID.
OK...

15:54.250 --> 15:56.000
MENTOR.

15:56.000 --> 15:58.959
HOW'D YOU GET INTO
THIS STUPID PROGRAM?

16:01.125 --> 16:02.792
[SOFTLY]
I HIT A GUY.

16:02.792 --> 16:03.959
WHAT?

16:03.959 --> 16:05.708
I HIT A GUY.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.125
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUTTA HERE.

16:07.125 --> 16:09.166
HEY, COME BACK. HEY!
COME BACK HERE!

16:09.166 --> 16:11.125
OR WHAT?
YOU'LL WHACK ME
UPSIDE THE HEAD?

16:11.125 --> 16:12.166
HERE, YOU LITTLE...

16:12.166 --> 16:14.041
HELP! HELP!
CHILD ABUSE!

16:14.041 --> 16:16.750
LET GO OF ME,
YOU HYPOCRITICAL
MANIAC!

16:16.750 --> 16:19.083
HIS FATHER'S NAME
IS ARTHUR, SO THEY
NAMED HIM ARTHUR JR.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.667
THAT'S WHAT
THE A.J. STANDS FOR.

16:21.667 --> 16:23.959
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE NEVER TOLD ME.

16:23.959 --> 16:25.792
YOU WOULD'VE
GOTTEN IT EVENTUALLY.

16:26.625 --> 16:28.792
WHO'S THAT?

16:28.792 --> 16:30.208
UH, A FRIEND.

16:32.542 --> 16:33.166
HE'S GORGEOUS.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.959
OH, THESE DRAWINGS
ARE INCREDIBLE.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.708
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE JUST
DRAW THESE ON THE SIDEWALK.

16:41.708 --> 16:45.750
ACTUALLY, SIDEWALK CHALK
DRAWINGS ARE A CLASSIC
PARISIAN TRADITION.

16:45.750 --> 16:48.625
YEAH, BUT WHO DOES
THIS KIND OF WORK?

16:48.625 --> 16:50.750
UH...ME.
UM...

16:50.750 --> 16:52.250
THAT ONE
TOOK ME 3 DAYS.

16:52.250 --> 16:54.708
PEOPLE JUST
RESPECTFULLY WALKED
AROUND WHILE I WORKED.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.667
THIS SEMESTER,
I'M STUDYING PHOTOGRAPHY.

16:57.667 --> 17:01.917
I GUESS I WAS WANTING
SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL
IN MY LIFE.

17:01.917 --> 17:04.416
HERE...TAKE THIS.

17:05.375 --> 17:07.500
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

17:07.500 --> 17:09.500
YEAH, WELL, HE MAY
CHICKEN OUT AND NOT EVEN
SHOW UP TOMORROW NIGHT.

17:09.500 --> 17:12.625
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
YOU REALLY HAVE TO
KICK HIS BUTT.

17:12.625 --> 17:14.125
HA.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.250
I MEAN...

17:15.250 --> 17:17.791
ONCE I GAVE HIM
SOME THICK
GRAY CRANE PAPER,

17:17.791 --> 17:20.375
TOLD HIM HE HAD TO
FILL IT UP WITH WORDS
BEFORE HE TALKED TO ME.

17:20.375 --> 17:22.165
AND HE DIDN'T
TALK TO ME FOR 2 WEEKS.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.959
OH!

17:23.959 --> 17:27.165
UH, THERE ARE SO MANY
THINGS THAT I'M LEARNING
ABOUT HIM EVERY DAY.

17:27.165 --> 17:30.375
DID YOU KNOW THAT HE LIKES
TO EAT ALL THE PEANUTS
OUT OF CHEX MIX?

17:30.375 --> 17:31.542
REALLY?

17:31.542 --> 17:33.458
YEAH. HE'S BEEN BANNED
FROM SOCIAL GATHERINGS

17:33.458 --> 17:35.875
IN OVER 20 STATES.
HEH, HEH.

17:35.875 --> 17:38.625
WELL, I HAVE BEEN
WITNESS TO HIS--
HIS PASTA SLURPING.

17:38.625 --> 17:41.041
OH--

17:41.041 --> 17:44.291
DOES HE STILL CONJUGATE
LATIN VERBS UNDER HIS BREATH
WHEN HE GETS NERVOUS?

17:44.291 --> 17:45.208
YEAH. UH...

17:45.208 --> 17:47.333
ADAMO, ADAMAS, ADAMAT--

17:47.333 --> 17:49.458
HE IS SUCH A MESS.

17:49.458 --> 17:49.917
YEAH...

17:49.917 --> 17:52.708
HE CAN KISS.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.208
YEAH, WELL--

17:55.208 --> 17:56.375
UH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO...

17:56.375 --> 17:58.417
ONCE.

18:01.959 --> 18:05.959
AFTERWARDS
WE FELT REALLY WEIRD
AND SILLY AND, UH...

18:09.166 --> 18:11.083
WELL, WE JUST...
WE KNOW EACH OTHER TOO WELL.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.041
AND, UH...

18:12.041 --> 18:14.291
WE HAVE
WAY TOO MANY FIGHTS.

18:15.291 --> 18:17.583
BUT THERE'S JUST...

18:17.583 --> 18:19.375
NO MYSTERY. SO, UM...

18:20.750 --> 18:24.417
THERE'S ABSOLUTELY
AND POSITIVELY

18:24.417 --> 18:26.250
NOTHING THERE.

18:30.083 --> 18:31.875
DO YOU HAVE ANY PLANS
FOR TOMORROW NIGHT?

18:33.583 --> 18:36.083
ACTUALLY
ONE OF MY FAVORITE ACTIVITIES.

18:36.083 --> 18:38.875
I'M GONNA GET
THE EARLY SUNDAY TIMES
AND JUST...

18:38.875 --> 18:40.208
COME WITH US.

18:41.125 --> 18:42.250
THAT'S YOUR THING.

18:42.250 --> 18:43.417
NO.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.250
YOU'RE, UH, A.J.'S
OLDEST FRIEND.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.417
YOU...YOU SHOULD
BE THERE.

18:47.417 --> 18:49.250
YEAH, BUT YOU'RE
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.291
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
FOR THE BOTH OF US

18:51.291 --> 18:53.166
TO BE A PART
OF A.J.'S LIFE?

18:55.291 --> 18:56.333
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT,
JOEY POTTER.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.000
HEY, YOU GUYS
ARE LEAVIN' ALREADY?

19:04.000 --> 19:07.291
OH, DAWSON,
I'VE EATEN SO MUCH
OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS,

19:07.291 --> 19:08.333
I JUST CAN'T BE OBJECTIVE.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.625
SURE YOU
DON'T WANT TO STAY?

19:09.625 --> 19:10.959
I'VE GOT A FEELING
ABOUT THE GUY.

19:10.959 --> 19:12.417
I CAN STILL
BE OBJECTIVE.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.333
IF THIS GUY IS HALF
AS BAD AS THE DOZEN
BEFORE HIM--

19:15.333 --> 19:16.750
HE SAYS THAT--

19:16.750 --> 19:18.625
NO!
DON'T EVEN MENTION ANYTHING
THAT COMES FROM THE SEA.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.667
OH!

19:22.417 --> 19:23.834
OOH, THANK YOU.

19:23.834 --> 19:26.291
I PROMISE
TO STOP DOING THIS
BEFORE YOU GUYS OPEN.

19:26.291 --> 19:26.959
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

19:26.959 --> 19:29.208
IS EVERYTHING OK?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.458
OH, GOD,
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:30.458 --> 19:33.667
YOUR WAITSTAFF
IS JUST EXPERIENCING
THE DIFFICULTIES

19:33.667 --> 19:35.083
OF PROPER SERVING.

19:35.708 --> 19:37.917
HI.

19:37.917 --> 19:41.500
JEN, I'D BE HAPPY
TO DEMONSTRATE
THE STANDARD WAY

19:41.500 --> 19:42.667
OF CARRYING A STACK.

19:42.667 --> 19:44.041
OH, THANK YOU, GOD.
THANK YOU.

19:45.250 --> 19:47.458
THANKS
FOR THE OFFER,
BUT, UM...

19:47.458 --> 19:48.291
I THINK WE'VE
GOT IT COVERED.

19:48.291 --> 19:51.000
WELL, OK,
THEN WHAT CAN I DO?

19:51.000 --> 19:52.625
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:52.625 --> 19:54.333
WELL, I'M HERE...

19:54.333 --> 19:57.625
REPORTING FOR WORK
AS REQUESTED.

19:57.625 --> 20:00.250
WHO REQUESTED THAT
YOU COME TO WORK?

20:12.208 --> 20:14.041
YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T KEEP
TREATING ME THIS WAY.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.041
THERE ARE LAWS.

20:15.041 --> 20:16.542
YOU HAVE TO FEED ME.

20:22.834 --> 20:23.834
HERE.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.166
WIENERS?

20:25.166 --> 20:27.208
IT'S ALL-BEEF.

20:27.208 --> 20:29.125
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT PART OF THE BEEF?

20:29.125 --> 20:30.792
COME HERE.

20:31.875 --> 20:33.417
WHEN ARE YOU
TAKING ME HOME?

20:33.417 --> 20:36.542
MY MOTHER'S
COOKING HER MEAT LOAF
AND MASHED POTATOES TONIGHT.

20:36.542 --> 20:39.583
YOU WANNA WAIT
FOR MEATLOAF AND
MASHED POTATOES, WAIT.

20:41.458 --> 20:43.125
WHO'S THE GIRL?

20:43.125 --> 20:44.708
WHAT GIRL?

20:44.708 --> 20:46.458
THE ONE YOU NAMED
YOUR BOAT AFTER?

20:46.458 --> 20:50.041
"TRUE LOVE"
ISN'T A PERSON.
IT'S AN IDEA,

20:50.041 --> 20:52.000
AN UNATTAINABLE IDEA.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.542
WHO'S
THE UNATTAINABLE GIRL?

20:54.542 --> 20:55.917
MAN, YOU JUST LOVE
GETTIN' UNDER MY SKIN,
DON'T YA?

20:55.917 --> 20:57.166
HAVE YOU KISSED HER?

20:57.166 --> 20:59.792
I TOLD YOU,
THERE'S NO GIRL.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.000
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST KISS HER?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.708
AND WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SHUT YOUR MOUTH?

21:02.708 --> 21:03.917
YOU HAVE NO PROBLEM
TAKING A SWING AT A GUY,

21:03.917 --> 21:06.917
BUT YOU CAN'T TELL A GIRL
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT HER.

21:06.917 --> 21:07.875
MAN, YOU'RE PATHETIC.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.625
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANNA GO HOME?

21:09.625 --> 21:13.166
YOU'RE BLUFFING.
YOU NEED ME
TO FINISH YOUR BOAT.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.875
I DON'T NEED YOU.
LET'S GO.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.583
BLUFFIN' COWARD.
LET'S GO.

21:16.583 --> 21:20.750
FINE. TOMORROW YOU'D
BETTER FIND SOMETHING
CREATIVE FOR ME TO DO,

21:20.750 --> 21:22.458
BECAUSE I'M NOT WORKING
ON THIS PITIFUL RAFT
ANYMORE.

21:22.458 --> 21:25.333
MAYBE TOMORROW
I JUST WON'T SHOW UP.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.375
MAKE MY DAY...

21:27.375 --> 21:28.041
LOSER!

21:28.041 --> 21:31.333
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

21:31.333 --> 21:34.125
I HAD A GOOD LIFE,
GOOD FRIENDS,

21:34.125 --> 21:35.708
A MODEST BUT PROMISING
LITTLE FUTURE

21:35.708 --> 21:38.625
TEACHING AT A JUNIOR COLLEGE
IN A PLEASANT SUBURBAN TOWN.

21:38.625 --> 21:40.834
AT THIS TIME,
IT IS MY HONOR
TO INTRODUCE THE YOUNG MAN

21:40.834 --> 21:43.291
WHO MADE THIS INSTITUTION
SO PROUD.

21:43.291 --> 21:45.625
TONIGHT,
HE WILL SHARE WITH US

21:45.625 --> 21:49.417
HIS IMAGINATIVE MIND
AND DISTINCTIVE VOICE.

21:49.417 --> 21:50.667
LOOK, THERE'S STILL TIME.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.583
DO YOU WANNA MAKE A BREAK
FOR THE BACK DOOR
WITH ME?

21:53.583 --> 21:55.417
A.J., COME UP HERE
AND SHARE WITH US.

21:55.417 --> 21:56.959
TOO LATE.

22:10.959 --> 22:12.375
GREETINGS.

22:12.375 --> 22:15.708
TONIGHT I'M REMINDED
OF F.D.R.'S IMMORTAL WORDS...

22:15.708 --> 22:19.500
"THE ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR
IS FEAR ITSELF."

22:19.500 --> 22:23.250
OF COURSE,
F.D.R. NEVER STOOD UP HERE.

22:25.291 --> 22:28.417
SILENT DREAM.

22:28.417 --> 22:29.500
"IT HAD ALWAYS SEEMED LIKE
A SILENT DREAM TO HER.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.625
"THE MANY MEANINGLESS PASSINGS
IN THE HALLWAY,

22:32.625 --> 22:36.250
"THE SENSE OF DISCONNECTION
FROM THOSE SHE SUPPOSEDLY
KNEW SO WELL,

22:36.250 --> 22:40.250
"BUT ONCE SHE MET HIM,
THE BOY SHE HAD ALREADY
KNOWN ALL HER LIFE,

22:40.250 --> 22:43.625
SHE REALIZED THAT LOVE UNSPOKEN
IS THE LOUDEST SOUND OF ALL."

22:46.542 --> 22:48.542
"AND SHE AWOKE."

22:53.333 --> 22:54.458
"HER NAME WAS MARY.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.125
"AND MORE THAN ANYTHING,

22:56.125 --> 22:58.542
"SHE LOVED TO READ
THE SUNDAY TIMES
ON SATURDAY NIGHT.

22:58.542 --> 23:00.375
"MARY DATED FREQUENTLY,

23:00.375 --> 23:03.708
"AND, SADLY, FOUND HER TIME
SPENT ALONE WAS THE ONLY
SHELTER FROM THE RAIN.

23:03.708 --> 23:08.041
"IT SEEMED NO ONE ELSE NOTICED
THE DAWN OF HER HEART.

23:08.041 --> 23:11.375
"I FELL INTO HER AND AWOKE
BY THE RADIANCE SHE BEAMED.

23:11.375 --> 23:13.208
"HER SILENT DREAM IS MY COURAGE.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.125
"HER DANCE IS MY FREEDOM.

23:16.125 --> 23:19.417
HER SMILE IS A PAINTING
OF MY SOUL."

23:22.750 --> 23:23.959
THE KID HATES ME.

23:23.959 --> 23:26.041
WELL, DON'T TAKE IT
PERSONALLY.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.625
HE'S BEEN THROUGH 4 MENTORS
IN THE LAST YEAR.

23:28.625 --> 23:30.875
THEN YOU'VE
BEEN EXPECTING
THIS CONVERSATION?

23:30.875 --> 23:32.500
I HAD HOPED NOT
TO HAVE IT WITH YOU,

23:32.500 --> 23:35.291
BUT I'M NOT SURPRISED.

23:35.291 --> 23:37.375
HIS MOTHER WORKS ALL HOURS,

23:37.375 --> 23:39.208
AND THE PROGRAM
ISN'T REALLY DESIGNED

23:39.208 --> 23:40.750
TO BE A CHEAP
BABY-SITTING SERVICE.

23:40.750 --> 23:43.542
I TRY TO DO MORE
WITH THAT KID
THAN JUST BABY-SIT HIM.

23:43.542 --> 23:45.708
HE HAS THE HIGHEST IQ
IN HIS CLASS,

23:45.708 --> 23:46.834
BUT HE'S CONSTANTLY FAILING.

23:46.834 --> 23:50.625
HE CAN'T SEEM TO FINISH
ANYTHING HE STARTS.

23:50.625 --> 23:52.542
GUESS THAT THING
WITH HIS FATHER REALLY
SCREWED HIM UP, HUH?

23:52.542 --> 23:53.750
WOULDN'T IT
SCREW YOU UP

23:53.750 --> 23:57.083
IF YOUR FATHER RAN OFF
WITH A YOUNG WOMAN?

23:57.083 --> 23:59.333
RAN OFF?

23:59.333 --> 24:01.875
STARTED
A WHOLE NEW FAMILY.

24:03.625 --> 24:04.959
IN NANTUCKET.

24:04.959 --> 24:06.583
MM-HMM.

24:08.291 --> 24:10.875
THAT'S WHY HE BEHAVES
THE WAY HE DOES.

24:10.875 --> 24:11.625
HE FEELS REJECTED.

24:11.625 --> 24:13.917
WELL, I KNOW THAT FEELING.

24:13.917 --> 24:17.250
SO HE TESTS THE PEOPLE
IN HIS LIFE,

24:17.250 --> 24:20.125
JUST TO SEE IF THEY'LL
COME BACK TO HIM.

24:21.708 --> 24:25.542
WELL, IF YOU LIKE,
WE CAN REASSIGN YOU
IMMEDIATELY.

24:25.542 --> 24:26.625
REASSIGN?

24:26.625 --> 24:28.875
WHAT? YOU THOUGHT
I CAME IN HERE

24:28.875 --> 24:30.458
'CAUSE I COULDN'T
HANDLE THE KID?

24:30.458 --> 24:33.250
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF PROBLEMS
THOSE OTHER 4 GUYS HAD,

24:33.250 --> 24:34.542
BUT THERE'S
NOT A KID ON EARTH

24:34.542 --> 24:35.792
THAT PACEY WITTER
CAN'T HANDLE.

24:35.792 --> 24:37.083
THE ONLY REASON
I CAME IN HERE

24:37.083 --> 24:39.333
WAS TO ASK YOU IF I COULD
PICK HIM UP EARLY TOMORROW.

24:41.166 --> 24:43.125
SURE. I THINK
WE COULD ARRANGE THAT.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.959
COOL.

24:51.959 --> 24:53.583
I'M REALLY ANGRY
WITH YOU, DAWSON.

24:53.583 --> 24:57.750
YOU HAD NO BUSINESS
TELLING YOUR FATHER
THAT I NEEDED HELP.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.291
BUT, MOM, YOU DO.

24:59.291 --> 25:01.667
WHERE DID YOU GET
A RIDICULOUS IDEA
LIKE THAT?

25:01.667 --> 25:04.750
RIDICULOUS? YOU MEAN,
LIKE THE STATE THIS PLACE
IS IN RIGHT NOW?

25:04.750 --> 25:07.667
MOM, YOU OPEN
IN LESS THAN A WEEK,
AND I CAN'T DO IT ALL.

25:07.667 --> 25:10.750
I ONLY ASKED YOU
TO SCREEN APPLICANTS
FOR MY WAITSTAFF,

25:10.750 --> 25:12.166
OVERSEE SOME TASTINGS.

25:12.166 --> 25:13.583
THINGS
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

25:13.583 --> 25:15.166
BRINGING IN
MY EX-HUSBAND CERTAINLY
ISN'T THE SOLUTION.

25:15.166 --> 25:17.750
OK, MOM, YOU--

25:17.750 --> 25:19.291
YOU AND DAD
HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR

25:19.291 --> 25:22.000
HOW MUCH YOU WANT TO
BE A PART OF EACH OTHER'S
LIVES, ALL RIGHT?

25:22.000 --> 25:23.917
I THOUGHT
I WAS CONFUSED BEFORE.

25:23.917 --> 25:26.834
DAWSON, DO YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO TELL YOU HOW TO
DIRECT YOUR MOVIES? NO.

25:26.834 --> 25:29.458
YOU NEED PEOPLE TO ACT
IN THEM, LIGHT THEM,
TAKE DIRECTION.

25:29.458 --> 25:31.333
THIS IS MY CAREER NOW,
DAWSON.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.875
GOD, I THOUGHT
OF ALL PEOPLE YOU
WOULD UNDERSTAND THAT!

25:33.875 --> 25:36.083
WELL, EXCUSE ME
FOR NOT WANTING
TO SEE YOU FAIL, MOM.

25:36.083 --> 25:37.583
IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT YOU'VE TAUGHT ME,

25:37.583 --> 25:40.834
IT'S THAT YOU
SHOULD NEVER BE ASHAMED
TO ASK FOR HELP, RIGHT?

25:40.834 --> 25:44.000
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
CAN'T TAKE YOUR OWN ADVICE.

25:50.125 --> 25:53.625
CAN YOU BELIEVE
THE PYNCHON LOOK-ALIKE
GAVE ME A BOTTLE OF DOM?

25:53.625 --> 25:56.041
IT'S DEFINITELY
YOUR NIGHT.

25:56.041 --> 25:58.625
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW LUCKY HE IS
YOU BROKE YOUR HEEL.

25:58.625 --> 25:59.875
THE GUY CAN'T DANCE
TO SAVE HIS LIFE.

26:06.708 --> 26:08.625
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

26:10.083 --> 26:11.750
HERE WE ARE.

26:11.750 --> 26:14.417
HAVE YOU GUYS THOUGHT
ABOUT HEADING DOWN
TO THE ARBORETUM?

26:14.417 --> 26:16.959
I BET IT'S AMAZING
DOWN THERE TONIGHT.

26:20.083 --> 26:22.208
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO YOUR ROOM.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.041
OK.

26:25.041 --> 26:26.917
GOOD.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.583
I'LL HAVE THE ARBORETUM
ALL TO MYSELF.

26:28.583 --> 26:29.750
I'LL CATCH YOU KIDS LATER.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.792
THIS IS YOURS.

26:33.417 --> 26:34.500
THANK YOU, MORGAN.

26:34.500 --> 26:36.291
YOU'RE WELCOME.

26:55.750 --> 26:57.667
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

26:59.917 --> 27:01.083
YOU TELL ME.

27:01.083 --> 27:05.041
YOU'RE FEELING GUILTY
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

27:05.041 --> 27:06.583
GUILTY? NO.

27:06.583 --> 27:09.250
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA
OF MORGAN HANGING OUT
BY HERSELF AT NIGHT.

27:09.250 --> 27:11.083
THAT'S ALL.

27:11.083 --> 27:11.917
GO JOIN HER.

27:14.333 --> 27:17.458
I WANT TO GO BACK
TO YOUR ROOM ALONE.

27:17.458 --> 27:19.000
WHAT?

27:19.000 --> 27:22.625
TONIGHT
IS ONE OF THE MOST
MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES

27:22.625 --> 27:24.417
OF YOUR LIFE, A.J.,

27:24.417 --> 27:27.333
AND YOU SHOULD SHARE IT
WITH MORGAN.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.417
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

27:29.417 --> 27:31.750
YOU'VE GOTTA
BE THE THICKEST
MENSA MEMBER AROUND.

27:31.750 --> 27:33.041
A.J., MORGAN
IS YOUR MUSE.

27:33.041 --> 27:34.125
NO, JOEY,
SHE'S JUST MY FRIEND.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.125
NO. SHE'S MORE
THAN JUST A FRIEND.

27:36.125 --> 27:38.000
SHE PICKS OUT PAPER
FOR YOU,

27:38.000 --> 27:39.583
AND SHE ENCOURAGES
YOU TO WRITE,

27:39.583 --> 27:41.083
AND SHE DEMANDS
THAT YOU BE YOURSELF,

27:41.083 --> 27:42.458
AND SHE DOES THIS
IN SUCH A SELFLESS WAY

27:42.458 --> 27:44.959
THAT YOU
CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO COMPREHEND AND--

27:44.959 --> 27:46.959
WAIT. WAIT, WAIT.
DID SHE TELL YOU SOMETHING?

27:46.959 --> 27:48.333
SHE WANTS MORE
THAN FRIENDSHIP?

27:48.333 --> 27:50.625
NO, NO. SHE--

27:50.625 --> 27:52.625
THEN WHERE
IS THIS COMING FROM?

27:54.834 --> 27:58.458
I KNOW WHAT
IT'S LIKE TO--

27:58.458 --> 28:01.667
TO HARBOR FEELINGS
FOR SOMEBODY THAT
YOU DENY, AND...

28:01.667 --> 28:04.458
I KNOW
HOW HORRIBLE IT IS

28:04.458 --> 28:07.708
TO REALIZE
THOSE FEELINGS
WAY TOO LATE,

28:07.708 --> 28:12.792
AND THIS IS COMING
FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE,
MY OWN LIFE, WHICH...

28:12.792 --> 28:13.708
HONESTLY...

28:13.708 --> 28:15.959
YOU KNOW
VERY LITTLE ABOUT.

28:15.959 --> 28:18.834
WELL, GOD, JOEY,
GIVE ME A CHANCE.

28:18.834 --> 28:21.208
LET ME GET TO KNOW
MORE ABOUT YOU.

28:21.208 --> 28:23.291
ISN'T THAT THE FUN PART?

28:23.291 --> 28:24.667
YES, IT'S--IT'S FUN,

28:24.667 --> 28:29.625
AND IT'S ROMANTIC
AND EXCITING
AND UNBELIEVABLE, BUT...

28:30.375 --> 28:33.000
IT'S NOT REAL.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.542
WELL, THEN,
LET'S MAKE IT REAL.

28:34.542 --> 28:38.041
SEE, YOU ALREADY HAVE
SOMETHING THAT IS REAL,

28:38.041 --> 28:41.250
AND MORGAN HAS JUST
RECENTLY REALIZED IT.

28:41.250 --> 28:44.000
WHY DO YOU THINK SHE
CAME BACK FROM FRANCE?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.208
CAN'T YOU HEAR IT, TOO?

28:47.208 --> 28:48.542
HEAR WHAT?

28:48.542 --> 28:51.500
THE LOUDEST SOUND OF ALL.

28:52.583 --> 28:53.625
LOVE UNSPOKEN.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.083
OH...

28:55.083 --> 28:56.875
THE FEELINGS
BETWEEN YOU AND MORGAN.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.875
JOEY, YOU'RE READING
WAY TOO MUCH INTO THIS.

28:59.875 --> 29:00.667
AM I?
YES.

29:00.667 --> 29:03.208
A.J., THEN WHY THE LOOK?

29:03.208 --> 29:04.875
WHAT LOOK?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

29:04.875 --> 29:07.375
IN THE READING,
YOU PAUSED,
AND YOU LOOKED AT HER.

29:07.375 --> 29:09.875
I DON'T KNOW.
I WAS READING SOMETHING AND--

29:09.875 --> 29:12.208
OK, I GUESS
IT MADE ME THINK OF HER.

29:12.208 --> 29:14.000
IT'S BECAUSE
IT'S ABOUT HER.

29:14.000 --> 29:15.917
NO, NO. IT'S
A MADE-UP CHARACTER, JOEY.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.583
UH...

29:20.583 --> 29:21.875
A.J., I...

29:22.750 --> 29:26.000
I WANT YOU TO GO TO HER.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.750
AND I WANT YOU TO...

29:28.750 --> 29:32.750
TO LOOK INTO HER EYES...

29:32.750 --> 29:36.417
AND LOOK DEEP...

29:36.417 --> 29:40.250
AND SEE JUST HOW MADE-UP
THAT CHARACTER IS.

29:40.250 --> 29:43.792
IS THAT WHAT YOU
REALLY WANT?

29:47.000 --> 29:48.417
YES.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.875
WELL...

29:52.875 --> 29:54.417
SO THAT'S IT?
I MEAN, WE'RE--

29:54.417 --> 29:57.750
WHAT ABOUT US?

29:59.834 --> 30:01.333
"US" IS--

30:01.333 --> 30:04.250
"US" IS SOMETHING
THAT...

30:04.250 --> 30:08.458
I'M GONNA REMEMBER
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

30:08.458 --> 30:10.750
BUT, SEE...

30:12.583 --> 30:14.083
"US" IS A MEMORY.

30:19.583 --> 30:21.625
AND YOU AND MORGAN...

30:21.625 --> 30:23.250
A REALITY.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.375
UH...

30:39.375 --> 30:43.000
I USED TO THINK
A BROKEN HEART
WAS JUST...

30:43.000 --> 30:44.333
HYPERBOLE.

30:46.208 --> 30:48.250
NOW I KNOW THE TRUTH.

30:51.792 --> 30:54.125
A.J., THERE ARE WORSE THINGS
THAN A BROKEN HEART.

30:57.750 --> 31:01.208
LIKE THE LOVE
THAT YOU DON'T EXPLORE.

31:05.125 --> 31:07.125
I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND...

31:07.792 --> 31:10.875
POTTER COMMA JOSEPH.

31:53.875 --> 31:56.542
I GAVE AT THE OFFICE.

31:56.542 --> 31:57.708
[WHAM]

31:57.708 --> 32:00.417
I JUST WANTED TO COME BY

32:00.417 --> 32:02.750
AND TELL YOU SOMETHING
ABOUT YOUR WORK
ON THE BOAT.

32:02.750 --> 32:04.041
YEAH?

32:04.041 --> 32:05.083
YEAH.

32:05.083 --> 32:07.250
IT AIN'T HALF-BAD, KID.

32:07.250 --> 32:11.583
YEAH. IF YOU PAY ATTENTION,
I'LL TEACH YOU A THING
OR TWO.

32:11.583 --> 32:16.041
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT MAKIN' MEATLOAF
AND MASHED POTATOES?

32:19.083 --> 32:21.333
YOU HAVE TO WORK IT
WITH YOUR HANDS.

32:28.417 --> 32:29.583
LIKE THIS?

32:29.583 --> 32:32.250
YOU'RE GETTING
THE HANG OF IT.

32:32.250 --> 32:35.333
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
YOUR MOM HAD TO WORK LATE
TONIGHT, HUH?

32:35.333 --> 32:36.792
YEAH.

32:38.083 --> 32:40.083
AND SO YOU KNOW,

32:40.083 --> 32:43.208
MY FATHER'S
NOT ENTIRELY DEAD.

32:54.250 --> 32:56.041
HER NAME IS JOEY.

32:56.041 --> 32:58.375
IS SHE A HOTTIE?

32:59.125 --> 33:01.125
I'M NOT ANSWERING THAT.

33:01.125 --> 33:02.625
COME ON. I'M 9.

33:02.625 --> 33:03.875
I HAVE YEARS
BEFORE I GET THERE.

33:03.875 --> 33:05.125
THE LEAST YOU CAN DO

33:05.125 --> 33:07.250
IS COUGH UP
A DESCRIPTION.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.208
OK...

33:14.333 --> 33:15.542
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL...

33:15.542 --> 33:19.500
THAT EVERY TIME YOU LOOK
AT HER, YOUR KNEES TREMBLE,

33:19.500 --> 33:20.542
AND YOUR HEART MELTS.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.208
AND YOU KNOW RIGHT THEN
AND THERE

33:22.208 --> 33:26.625
WITHOUT ANY RESERVATIONS
THAT THERE'S ORDER AND
MEANING TO THE UNIVERSE.

33:26.625 --> 33:28.000
SHE'S A HOTTIE.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.667
YES, SHE IS.

33:29.667 --> 33:32.959
WHERE IS SHE?

33:32.959 --> 33:34.333
RIGHT NOW...

33:34.333 --> 33:37.291
SHE IS PROBABLY OUT
HAVING THE TIME
OF HER LIFE.

34:27.166 --> 34:28.542
LOOKS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN
OUT HERE FOR A WHILE.

34:28.542 --> 34:30.875
YEAH.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.417
I BET YOU
COULD USE A FRIEND.

34:34.208 --> 34:37.375
FOR SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN
SO WRAPPED UP IN HER
OWN LITTLE WORLD,

34:37.375 --> 34:39.333
YOU'RE
PRETTY PERCEPTIVE.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.041
WELL, THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF GIRL I AM:

34:42.041 --> 34:44.125
THOUGHTFUL AND PATHETIC,

34:44.125 --> 34:45.875
AND I CAN SEE
PRETTY MUCH SEE EVERYTHING
THAT HAPPENS OUT HERE

34:45.875 --> 34:47.958
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

34:47.958 --> 34:50.250
SO YOU HEARD THE FIGHT
I HAD WITH MY MOM.

34:50.250 --> 34:51.500
YEAH...

34:51.500 --> 34:55.250
AND THEN I CAUGHT
A MINI VERSION
OF HER WRATH MYSELF.

34:55.250 --> 34:59.500
JUST AFTER I BROKE
A FEW MORE PLATES.

35:01.250 --> 35:04.750
I THINK THE PRESSURE
OF THE RESTAURANT HAS
FINALLY GOTTEN TO HER.

35:04.750 --> 35:10.250
I WAS JUST--YOU SAW.
ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO
WAS HELP HER OUT,

35:10.250 --> 35:13.250
AND SHE COMPLETELY
UNLOADED ON ME.

35:13.250 --> 35:17.417
OH, I THINK YOU WERE
TRYING TO DO A LITTLE MORE
THAN JUST HELP HER.

35:17.417 --> 35:20.834
YOU'RE TRYING
TO HELP YOURSELF, TOO.

35:20.834 --> 35:22.542
HELP MYSELF?

35:22.542 --> 35:25.417
YOU'RE TRYING TO PUT
YOUR FAMILY BACK TOGETHER,
DAWSON.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.542
WHAT?

35:27.542 --> 35:29.667
NO, I'M NOT.

35:29.667 --> 35:33.208
HEY, COME ON,
YOU SAW HOW ANGRY I WAS
AT THE B & B

35:33.208 --> 35:35.083
WHEN THEY TRIED TO POSE
AS HUSBAND AND WIFE.

35:35.083 --> 35:37.792
EXACTLY. BECAUSE
IT WAS A FACADE, A LIE.

35:37.792 --> 35:40.291
OF COURSE THAT UPSET YOU,

35:40.291 --> 35:41.667
BUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE RESTAURANT IS REAL.

35:41.667 --> 35:45.125
WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THE RESTAURANT
IS CHAOS.

35:45.125 --> 35:46.125
WE INVARIABLY RETURN
TO WHAT WE KNOW, DAWSON,

35:46.125 --> 35:49.333
WHAT'S IN OUR BONES.

35:49.333 --> 35:51.792
AND YOUR FAMILY, THAT--

35:51.792 --> 35:53.750
IT'S IN YOUR BONES.

35:53.750 --> 35:57.750
YEAH, BUT I KNOW
THAT THEY'RE NOT
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

35:57.750 --> 36:01.166
SO, UH...

36:01.875 --> 36:06.708
SO WHAT AM I DOIN'?

36:06.708 --> 36:12.875
DO YOU REMEMBER A COUPLE
OF YEARS AGO AT THAT SPOT
RIGHT OVER THERE...

36:12.875 --> 36:15.625
YOU ASKED ME TO DANCE...

36:15.625 --> 36:19.291
AND YOU SAID
THAT YOU WANTED TO BE
MY BOY ADVENTURE?

36:19.291 --> 36:20.834
UH...

36:22.125 --> 36:24.333
DID I REALLY SAY THAT?

36:26.041 --> 36:26.959
OH, I WAS SO NAIVE.

36:26.959 --> 36:28.875
AND SWEET AND HONEST.

36:28.875 --> 36:33.959
ON THE OUTSIDE,
YOU'RE NOT THAT SAME
NAIVE LITTLE BOY ANYMORE.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.375
YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH
TOO MUCH RECENTLY, BUT--

36:36.375 --> 36:40.625
BUT DEEP DOWN
AT YOUR CORE,

36:40.625 --> 36:43.667
THERE'S ALWAYS
GONNA BE A PART OF YOU
THAT REJECTS REALITY

36:43.667 --> 36:45.417
AND THAT'S ETERNALLY HOPEFUL

36:45.417 --> 36:47.583
AND...

36:47.583 --> 36:50.208
AND THAT JUST WANTS
HIS PARENTS BACK TOGETHER.

36:55.125 --> 36:55.417
HEY.

36:57.792 --> 36:58.375
HEY.

36:58.375 --> 37:00.417
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

37:02.708 --> 37:04.375
NOTHING HAPPENED.

37:09.333 --> 37:11.208
YOU GOT BORED?

37:11.208 --> 37:15.333
YOU GOT HOMESICK?

37:15.333 --> 37:16.542
HE FINALLY RIPPED OFF
HIS RUBBER MASK

37:16.542 --> 37:18.417
AND REVEALED HIS TRUE
ALIEN FEATURES, WHAT?

37:18.417 --> 37:21.000
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

37:21.000 --> 37:24.041
OH, WELL, FORGIVE ME
IF I'M HAVING A LITTLE
BIT OF TROUBLE

37:24.041 --> 37:25.500
WITH THE NO-QUESTIONS-
ASKED PART.

37:43.458 --> 37:44.792
GOOD MORNING.

37:44.792 --> 37:46.667
GOOD MORNING.

37:46.667 --> 37:49.417
I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE
FOR, UH...

37:49.417 --> 37:51.208
UNDERCUTTING YOUR AUTHORITY
AROUND HERE

37:51.208 --> 37:52.542
AND TO OFFER MY SERVICES,

37:52.542 --> 37:55.834
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
DOIN' JUST FINE WITHOUT ME.

38:02.041 --> 38:04.667
THIS COFFEE TASTES
LIKE CLAM CHOWDER.

38:04.667 --> 38:06.291
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.708
THAT IS GOOD.

38:09.708 --> 38:10.708
UH-HUH.

38:10.708 --> 38:13.291
THIS IS NOT THE PLACE
I LEFT LAST NIGHT.

38:13.291 --> 38:16.125
OH, YOU MEAN, YOU WEREN'T
AT LEERY'S FRESH FISH?

38:16.125 --> 38:17.375
I THOUGHT LEERY'S
FRESH FISH WAS--

38:17.375 --> 38:20.583
IT'S HER NAME, TOO, DAWSON.

38:22.333 --> 38:23.417
OK?

38:24.375 --> 38:26.000
SO WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

38:26.000 --> 38:27.917
YOU KNOW,
YOU WERE RIGHT, HONEY.

38:27.917 --> 38:31.458
I DO NEED A PARTNER,
AND I WAS JUST TOO PROUD
TO ADMIT IT.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.166
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.959
RUNNING A RESTAURANT
TAKES MANY TALENTS.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.375
YOU'VE GOT THE MOST
IMPORTANT ONE.

38:36.375 --> 38:38.041
YOU KNOW
HOW TO DELEGATE.

38:38.041 --> 38:40.792
SO YOU MADE DAD
A PARTNER AFTER ALL?

38:40.792 --> 38:42.125
NO, NO. THAT
WOULD NEVER WORK.

38:42.125 --> 38:43.625
SHE HIRED ME AS
THE GENERAL MANAGER.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.291
"HIRED" BEING
THE OPERATIVE WORD.

38:45.291 --> 38:46.708
AND MY FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS

38:46.708 --> 38:50.583
WAS TO STRONGLY SUGGEST
SHE MAKE BODIE
HER PARTNER.

38:50.583 --> 38:52.000
BODIE? BUT WAIT--

38:52.000 --> 38:53.959
WELL, YEAH, HE'S GONNA
OWN 20% OF THE BUSINESS,

38:53.959 --> 38:56.834
AND IN RETURN,
HE'S GONNA PROVIDE ME
WITH ALL OF HIS RECIPES,

38:56.834 --> 38:58.041
OVERSEE THE KITCHEN,
WORK ONLY NIGHTS.

38:58.041 --> 39:00.542
THAT WAY, IT WON'T TAKE HIM
AWAY FROM HIS B & B.

39:00.542 --> 39:02.500
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
FIRE JEN FROM THE WAITSTAFF.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.000
BUT--
HONEY...

39:04.000 --> 39:06.583
AS A WAITRESS,
SHE'S GONNA PUT ME OUT
OF BUSINESS IN A WEEK.

39:06.583 --> 39:08.333
BUT SHE'D MAKE
A CHARMING HOSTESS.

39:08.333 --> 39:10.625
I THINK SHE
WOULD LIKE THAT.

39:13.625 --> 39:15.458
APPARENTLY YOU GUYS
WORK WELL TOGETHER.

39:37.834 --> 39:39.500
SO ARE YOU EVER
GONNA SPEAK AGAIN?

39:43.166 --> 39:45.834
OH, COME ON, JO,
SAY SOMETHING.

39:47.542 --> 39:50.792
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY, PACEY...

39:50.792 --> 39:53.792
YOU WERE RIGHT?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.375
YOU WERE RIGHT, OK?

39:55.375 --> 39:57.041
RIGHT AS ALWAYS.

39:57.041 --> 39:58.708
PACEY WITTER:

39:58.708 --> 40:01.667
THE ONLY PERSON
IN MY LIFE WHO EVER
SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

40:01.667 --> 40:05.708
THAT'S NOT
ENTIRELY ACCURATE.

40:05.708 --> 40:08.875
WELL, YOU TOLD ME
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

40:08.875 --> 40:10.583
WHICH WAS WHAT, JO?

40:10.583 --> 40:12.041
WHAT HAPPENED UP THERE?

40:12.041 --> 40:14.959
[SIGHS LOUDLY]

40:15.625 --> 40:18.291
THERE WAS ANOTHER GIRL.

40:20.000 --> 40:23.333
OH...

40:23.333 --> 40:25.500
I'M SORRY, JO.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.583
YOU KNOW, THE WHOLE TIME
THAT I WAS WATCHING THEM,

40:28.583 --> 40:30.291
I JUST KEPT THINKING...

40:30.291 --> 40:32.208
THIS IS IT.

40:34.166 --> 40:38.083
THIS IS REAL,
JUST LIKE PACEY SAID.

40:38.083 --> 40:41.000
THIS IS THE REAL THING.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.750
AND IT REMINDED ME ONCE AGAIN
WHAT EXACTLY I DON'T HAVE.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.083
IF YOU KEEP LOOKING,
YOU'LL FIND IT.

40:51.083 --> 40:52.458
NO, I WON'T.

40:52.458 --> 40:54.917
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT
OBVIOUS BY NOW?

40:54.917 --> 40:57.083
I'M NOT MEANT TO.

40:57.083 --> 40:58.000
WHY? BECAUSE
YOU'RE 16 AND ALONE?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.083
COME ON.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.458
NO. BECAUSE I'M 16,
AND IN MY ENTIRE LIFE,

41:01.458 --> 41:03.625
THERE HAVE BEEN 2 PEOPLE
WHO HAVE ACTUALLY
KNOWN ME, PACEY:

41:03.625 --> 41:06.500
DAWSON AND--
THIS A.J. GUY DIDN'T KNOW YOU.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.125
I DON'T CARE HOW YOU
FELT ABOUT HIM, JO.

41:08.125 --> 41:09.583
HE DIDN'T KNOW YOU,
'CAUSE IF HE DID,

41:09.583 --> 41:11.375
HE NEVER WOULD
HAVE WALKED AWAY.

41:11.375 --> 41:12.667
I WAS GOING TO
SAY YOU, PACEY.

41:17.458 --> 41:17.708
OK.

41:19.750 --> 41:21.583
HAVE YOU
TOTALLY LOST IT?

41:21.583 --> 41:23.583
NOPE, NOT TOTALLY,
NOT YET.

41:29.500 --> 41:31.000
ALL RIGHT, WHAT
DID YOU MEAN BY THAT?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.208
ABOUT WHAT?

41:33.208 --> 41:35.291
ABOUT ME
KNOWING YOU BETTER
THAN ANYBODY ELSE.

41:35.291 --> 41:37.208
EXACTLY WHAT I SAID,
PACEY.

41:37.208 --> 41:38.542
YOU KNOW ME, OK?

41:38.542 --> 41:40.959
IN A WAY THAT NOBODY ELSE
BESIDES DAWSON EVER HAS.

41:40.959 --> 41:42.834
WE'RE NOT TALKIN'
ABOUT DAWSON RIGHT NOW.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.083
WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT ME.

41:44.083 --> 41:45.542
YOU CAN'T KEEP ON
DOIN' THIS TO ME.

41:45.542 --> 41:46.583
DOING WHAT?

41:46.583 --> 41:48.291
SO I COUNT ON YOU,
AND I TELL YOU SECRETS?

41:48.291 --> 41:50.667
YOU CALL ME IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE NIGHT TO PICK YOU UP.
WHY?

41:50.667 --> 41:52.375
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT I CALLED.

41:52.375 --> 41:53.458
I THOUGHT THAT I COULD--

41:53.458 --> 41:54.875
I'M NOT MAD
THAT YOU CALLED ME.

41:54.875 --> 41:56.542
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU CALLED ME.

41:56.542 --> 42:00.000
YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON
THAT I THOUGHT OF, PACEY.

42:00.000 --> 42:01.750
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN, JO?

42:01.750 --> 42:02.625
IT MEANS THAT...

42:05.000 --> 42:06.500
I GUESS IT--

42:06.500 --> 42:08.125
IT MEANS
THAT I CAN TALK TO YOU

42:08.125 --> 42:09.166
AND THAT YOU'RE THERE
FOR ME.

42:09.166 --> 42:10.542
DON'T YOU EVER
GET TIRED OF TALKIN'?

42:10.542 --> 42:13.291
NO. I DON'T.
WELL, I GET TIRED.

42:13.291 --> 42:15.166
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ANYMORE.

42:15.166 --> 42:16.166
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, PACEY?

42:16.166 --> 42:17.166
WHY ARE WE STANDING HERE?
I DON'T--
