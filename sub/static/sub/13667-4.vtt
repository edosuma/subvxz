The vessels in your feet
aren't giving you
an adequate supply of Blood.

11:49.206 --> 11:53.310
Now, the only way
We're gonna find out
what's going on...

11:53.377 --> 11:56.747
is to inject some Dye
into the vessels,
and then take some pictures.

11:56.814 --> 12:01.252
- It's called Angiography.
- You're gonna make me
radioactive, huh?

12:01.318 --> 12:03.254
Well,

12:03.320 --> 12:06.057
you might have
some reaction to the Dye,

12:06.123 --> 12:09.627
but usually we can handle that.

12:09.693 --> 12:12.897
See? I read the papers too.

Couple of days late, maybe,
