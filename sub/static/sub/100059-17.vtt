WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.093
- Because when we reach out
to others,

00:06.136 --> 00:08.312
we reach in to our hearts.

00:08.356 --> 00:10.140
Today, let's show the world

00:10.184 --> 00:13.274
how much Zephra cares.

00:13.317 --> 00:14.623
- I'm not doing
any of that stuff.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.928
- We have to build houses?

00:15.972 --> 00:17.278
- I'm not comfortable
around tools or kids.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.149
- Pass.
- Okay, guys, relax.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.455
You don't have to do
any of the things

00:20.498 --> 00:21.673
you just saw in the video.

00:21.717 --> 00:22.979
All you have to do today

00:23.023 --> 00:24.807
is hand out
these nifty care packages

00:24.850 --> 00:26.678
to the Holloway House
Women's Shelter

00:26.722 --> 00:28.550
and ask our customers
to round up

00:28.593 --> 00:29.986
to the nearest dollar
for charity.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.335
Easy.
- Wow.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.076
Cloud 9 never did
any of this stuff,

00:33.120 --> 00:34.599
but I feel like Zephra cares.

00:34.643 --> 00:37.515
- Well, let's not just blindly
believe the T-shirts.

00:37.559 --> 00:40.127
Although Zephra
is a fine company

00:40.170 --> 00:41.737
which I am not criticizing
today

00:41.780 --> 00:43.391
as was made clear to me
in the car.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.610
But guys,
Amy set this whole thing up.

00:45.654 --> 00:46.959
- Please.

00:47.003 --> 00:48.178
- I mean,
she chose the charity,

00:48.222 --> 00:51.007
she got local businesses
to donate goods.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.922
- So this stuff is donated?
Zephra didn't even pay for it?

00:52.965 --> 00:54.358
- It's a PR stunt.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.968
- Okay, I'm confused.

00:56.012 --> 00:58.058
Is Zephra good or bad?

00:58.101 --> 01:00.321
- Glenn, come on.
It's not that easy.

01:00.364 --> 01:02.323
- They did give us
that Lyft discount though.

01:02.366 --> 01:04.455
Today I got to ride
in a Kia Soul.

01:04.499 --> 01:06.501
Guys, believe the hype.

01:06.544 --> 01:09.330
- Well, I read Zephra
does blood diamonds.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.375
- What do you mean by "does?"

01:11.419 --> 01:13.421
- Uh, I don't know.
I didn't click on it.

01:13.464 --> 01:15.379
- I did hear that Zephra
gives a lot of money

01:15.423 --> 01:16.902
to struggling communities.

01:16.946 --> 01:18.208
- We all heard that, Justine.

01:18.252 --> 01:20.384
They said it, like,
12 times in the video.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.212
- "Those communities
might not be struggling

01:22.256 --> 01:23.779
if Zephra paid taxes."

01:23.822 --> 01:26.129
It's a text from Jonah.

01:26.173 --> 01:27.348
- Butt text.

01:32.396 --> 01:34.398
- Buses from the shelter
will be arriving all day,

01:34.442 --> 01:36.357
so Glenn, you're gonna be
running care packages

01:36.400 --> 01:37.706
from the warehouse,

01:37.749 --> 01:40.100
or doing that waddle thing
you do, whatever works.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.014
- Female hips, so...

01:42.058 --> 01:43.233
- Garrett, you're only
giving packages

01:43.277 --> 01:44.495
to people with wristbands.

01:44.539 --> 01:46.149
- Wait, so we're just gonna
turn people away

01:46.193 --> 01:48.020
'cause they don't have
a wristband?

01:48.064 --> 01:49.457
- So for all
intensive purposes,

01:49.500 --> 01:51.850
people in need without
a wristband are dead to us.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.548
- "Intensive purposes?"

01:53.591 --> 01:55.550
Did you mean
"intents and purposes?"

01:56.855 --> 01:58.161
- I mean, you could say it
both ways.

01:59.554 --> 02:02.122
You can, but one way
makes you sound like an idiot.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.384
You're lucky you're pretty.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.777
- All right, you know what?
I know what it--

02:05.821 --> 02:08.302
you're lucky I'm pretty!

02:08.345 --> 02:10.173
- You went way above
and beyond.

02:10.217 --> 02:12.958
Most stores are just writing
"fight breast cancer" on a jar

02:13.002 --> 02:14.351
and sticking it at checkout.

02:14.395 --> 02:17.746
- Yeah, I mean, breast cancer
is so first thought.

02:17.789 --> 02:19.182
For a good reason.

02:19.226 --> 02:21.924
You know, one in eight.
Affects us all.

02:21.967 --> 02:24.709
- Anyway, I want Zephra
to know you're kicking ass,

02:24.753 --> 02:25.971
so I got them to send someone

02:26.015 --> 02:29.061
to do a profile of you
for the website.

02:29.105 --> 02:31.194
- A profile?
Of me?

02:31.238 --> 02:33.849
Um, okay.
Wow.

02:33.892 --> 02:36.765
Well, I've never been profiled
before.

02:36.808 --> 02:38.375
I mean, except racially.

02:38.419 --> 02:41.204
- This could be really good
for you, so sell yourself.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.814
We'll talk after, okay?
Bye.

02:42.858 --> 02:44.076
- Bye.

02:44.120 --> 02:45.687
- This is great!

02:45.730 --> 02:47.689
I mean, we hate it.
Why do we hate it?

02:47.732 --> 02:50.170
- No, no, it's--
it's fine, it's fine.

02:50.213 --> 02:52.172
It's just--I don't know,

02:52.215 --> 02:54.435
I don't know how to brag
about myself,

02:54.478 --> 02:56.915
it feels gross, and now
I'm supposed to take a charity

02:56.959 --> 02:58.047
and make it all about me.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.483
- Hey, you took
their empty slogan

02:59.527 --> 03:01.137
and did something
actually great with it.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.486
You deserve to brag
a little bit.

03:02.530 --> 03:05.576
I think you should be
on all the websites.

03:05.620 --> 03:07.752
I mean,
except for the incel ones.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.189
And most of Reddit.

03:09.232 --> 03:11.234
4chan, 8chan...

03:11.278 --> 03:12.888
I hope you're never
on a website.

03:12.931 --> 03:15.238
- Oh, hey, Glenn.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.718
Just a heads up,
you might be getting a call

03:16.761 --> 03:17.719
from my landlady.

03:17.762 --> 03:19.286
- Oh, fun!

03:19.329 --> 03:21.026
Oh, wait, is everything okay?

03:21.070 --> 03:22.202
- Oh, yeah.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.768
It's just 'cause
you cosigned the lease,

03:23.812 --> 03:26.118
and Bo and I were late
on the rent last month.

03:26.162 --> 03:27.685
And this month.

03:27.729 --> 03:28.860
She's crazy.

03:28.904 --> 03:30.514
She's got, like,
a total boner for rent.

03:30.558 --> 03:32.124
- Cheyenne, if you're having
money problems,

03:32.168 --> 03:33.778
I'm more than happy to help.

03:33.822 --> 03:36.390
- Oh, thanks, but no,
we'll figure it out.

03:36.433 --> 03:39.697
It's just, you know,
groceries and kid expenses

03:39.741 --> 03:41.699
and then you get caught up
in a pyramid scheme

03:41.743 --> 03:43.223
and then your husband
breaks his tailbone

03:43.266 --> 03:44.615
at backyard wrestling.

03:44.659 --> 03:45.747
- Oh.

03:45.790 --> 03:47.096
- Anyway, I'm gonna go see
if Robot Glenn

03:47.139 --> 03:48.402
sucked up any change.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.236
- Big breakfast.

03:58.194 --> 03:59.935
- All right, it checks out.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.545
You'd be surprised
how many people pose

04:01.589 --> 04:02.981
as corporate reps
at charity events

04:03.025 --> 04:04.200
just to try to get free stuff.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.377
- Really?
How do they pull that off?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.553
- I'm not gonna tell you that.
- Oh.

04:09.597 --> 04:11.163
- Sorry.

04:11.207 --> 04:13.078
She's been a little extra
since she saw "Richard Jewell."

04:13.122 --> 04:14.732
- Ah.

04:14.776 --> 04:18.127
- Anyway, thank you for
coming and talking to me.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.737
- Hey, always happy to show off

04:19.781 --> 04:22.349
one of the leaders
in our new Cloud 9 family.

04:22.392 --> 04:24.307
This is a really cool event
you've put together.

04:24.351 --> 04:25.613
- Well thank you,

04:25.656 --> 04:27.354
but I couldn't have done this
without my team.

04:27.397 --> 04:30.400
I mean, most of the credit
goes to them.

04:30.444 --> 04:33.447
And I also share
some of that credit.

04:33.490 --> 04:34.709
- Hey, hey!

04:34.752 --> 04:37.015
- Jeff?
What are you doing here?

04:37.059 --> 04:38.713
- Thought I'd surprise you,
check in on the event

04:38.756 --> 04:39.931
from the Cloud 9 side
of things.

04:39.975 --> 04:42.194
- Oh, wow.
You survived the acquisition?

04:42.238 --> 04:44.588
Not that I thought
that they were gonna fire you.

04:44.632 --> 04:47.069
I mean, obviously
they value your...

04:48.679 --> 04:50.638
Jeff, this is Isabel.
She works at Zephra.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.814
- Oh, oh, the parent company!

04:52.857 --> 04:54.381
Oh, maybe I should
call you Mommy.

04:54.424 --> 04:56.121
I'm gay, so that's not weird.

04:56.165 --> 04:58.602
- Oh good, 'cause for a second
I almost thought it was.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.430
No, I'm from Digital Content.

05:00.474 --> 05:02.432
We're doing a profile on Amy
for the website.

05:02.476 --> 05:04.391
- Oh, very cool, very cool.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.175
Listen, I'm gonna run inside
and say hi to Mateo.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.350
We've been playing phone tag

05:07.394 --> 05:10.484
and he's been it
for, like, the whole time.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.442
Everything looks shipshape.
Okay.

05:12.486 --> 05:15.445
- Great.
Glad you approve.

05:15.489 --> 05:17.969
I was 100% sure
he'd been fired.

05:18.013 --> 05:20.537
- He didn't get fired?
- I know, it's insane.

05:20.581 --> 05:23.627
- Ooh, I didn't know
we carried aged balsamic.

05:23.671 --> 05:25.325
Nice.
- Oh, yeah, it's great.

05:25.368 --> 05:26.456
I make a reduction

05:26.500 --> 05:28.240
and I drizzle it
over vanilla ice cream.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.459
- Ah, that sounds amazing!

05:29.503 --> 05:31.287
Are you, like,
a culinary student, or--

05:31.331 --> 05:32.462
- Oh.

05:32.506 --> 05:33.942
Haven't been a student
of anything

05:33.985 --> 05:35.160
for a couple decades.

05:35.204 --> 05:36.379
- Ah, you could've fooled me.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.341
Your total is $36.48.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.646
Would you like to round up
to $37 today

05:42.690 --> 05:44.039
for Holloway House
Women's Shelter?

05:44.082 --> 05:45.170
- Oh, yeah, sure.

05:45.214 --> 05:46.171
- Thank you so much.

05:46.215 --> 05:49.261
It's for a great cause.

05:49.305 --> 05:52.395
All right.
Thank you.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.266
- You have five minutes
to tell Amy, or I will.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.312
- Tell Amy what?

05:56.356 --> 05:58.445
- How you were flirting
with that lady.

05:58.488 --> 05:59.968
Turning each other's cranks.

06:00.011 --> 06:02.187
I thought you two were gonna
do it right here on the belt.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.190
- Oh, come on, Sandra.
I was just being friendly.

06:05.234 --> 06:08.193
Customers appreciate a little,
you know, human connection.

06:08.237 --> 06:11.196
- Ugh.
Close your legs, Jonah.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.373
- My legs are fine,

06:13.416 --> 06:14.852
and if anything,

06:14.896 --> 06:17.377
we should be a little
friendlier than usual today

06:17.420 --> 06:19.074
to get people to round up
for charity.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.511
- Not if it means betraying
the woman you love.

06:21.555 --> 06:23.861
Trust me, I'm married now.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.516
Don't you dream about someday
having what Jerry and I have?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.910
- Of course--well,
exactly what you and Jerry--

06:28.953 --> 06:30.738
it's fine, Sandra.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.522
Hi.
How's it going?

06:32.566 --> 06:33.654
Hope you didn't have
any trouble

06:33.697 --> 06:35.177
finding those toe warmers.

06:35.220 --> 06:38.049
- He's gonna die alone.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.748
- Look, Mateo, when I put
my career on the line for you,

06:40.791 --> 06:42.837
it was because
it was the right thing to do.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.056
You don't owe me anything.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.536
Although brunch
wouldn't kill you.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.538
- Look, Jeff,
it's not gonna happen.

06:48.582 --> 06:50.235
I'm actually seeing someone.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.368
- Oh.
Oh, yeah?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.848
Mateo, that's amazing!

06:53.891 --> 06:55.806
- Thank you.
That's very nice of you.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.721
- I'm very happy for you.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.462
How'd you guys meet, or I mean,
have you met yet

06:59.506 --> 07:01.290
or is it maybe, like,
an online thing?

07:01.333 --> 07:03.161
- Actually, Amy introduced us.

07:03.205 --> 07:04.554
He's her brother.

07:04.598 --> 07:06.730
- Oh, Amy did?

07:06.774 --> 07:09.472
That's so nice of her.

07:09.516 --> 07:11.387
Hey, folks.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.606
How's that digital coming?

07:12.649 --> 07:13.781
- Good, yeah.

07:13.824 --> 07:15.173
We're getting
some good digital.

07:15.217 --> 07:16.914
Actually, Amy's just showing me
around a little

07:16.958 --> 07:18.525
before the buses come
so I can get a sense

07:18.568 --> 07:19.917
of what she's like
as a manager.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.354
- Ooh. Feels like I should
get in on that action.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.704
- Does it?

07:23.747 --> 07:25.706
- Yeah, actually,
it would be really helpful

07:25.749 --> 07:27.098
to get some quotes
from corporate.

07:27.142 --> 07:28.317
- Yeah, sure.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.579
That--that would be great.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.147
- Nice.
We'll make it a three-way.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.801
Again, totally gay.

07:38.980 --> 07:40.808
- ♪ Think of your fellow man

07:40.851 --> 07:43.550
♪ Lend him a helping hand

07:43.593 --> 07:45.073
♪ Put a little love in

07:45.116 --> 07:48.555
- And this is the break room.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.295
Um... oh, I--

07:50.339 --> 07:52.820
I noticed that there was always
a really long line

07:52.863 --> 07:55.431
at the toaster,
so I bought another one.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.522
Which, you know,
I think people appreciated.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.090
- I think you got your headline
there, "Manager buys toaster."

08:02.133 --> 08:04.005
- That's helpful, Jeff.
Thank you.

08:04.048 --> 08:07.487
Oh, and also,
I know how hard it is

08:07.530 --> 08:09.663
to eat healthy
during long shifts,

08:09.706 --> 08:14.102
so I keep this cabinet full
of healthy snacks for everyone.

08:14.145 --> 08:16.583
- Oof, that cabinet
is pretty full.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.802
Seems like people would rather
die than eat that stuff.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.500
- Well, I just replenished it.

08:20.543 --> 08:21.631
- Yeah, and thank you

08:21.675 --> 08:23.720
for the healthy seaweed snack,
SpongeBob.

08:23.764 --> 08:24.895
Just messing with you,
SpongeBob.

08:24.939 --> 08:27.463
- Sorry, I'm--I'm SpongeBob?
Is--

08:27.507 --> 08:29.030
- All right,
there's a scarf in here.

08:29.073 --> 08:30.422
Now be careful.
That's a loose knit,

08:30.466 --> 08:32.294
so avoid all hooks
and low-hanging branches.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.948
It'll pop your head clean off.

08:33.991 --> 08:35.079
- Huh.
That's weird.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.472
It looks like
we're one package short.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.126
- One package?

08:38.169 --> 08:40.607
Wow, that's news to me.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.261
Short, you said.
Huh.

08:43.305 --> 08:44.480
- You must've counted wrong.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.786
- No, I counted right.

08:45.829 --> 08:46.917
I double-checked
and everything.

08:46.961 --> 08:48.005
- It's fine.

08:48.049 --> 08:49.616
I'll just count 'em again
myself.

08:49.659 --> 08:51.182
- Okay, so now you're saying
I don't know how to count?

08:51.226 --> 08:52.793
- Well, no offense, Garrett,

08:52.836 --> 08:54.359
but you did say
"intensive purposes,"

08:54.403 --> 08:56.100
which, apparently,
is kind of dumb.

08:56.144 --> 08:57.449
- I'm not dumb!

08:57.493 --> 08:59.147
I'm one of the smartest people
in the store.

08:59.190 --> 09:00.757
- Well, that's a bit
of a stretch.

09:00.801 --> 09:02.933
- It's true.
It's kind of my thing.

09:02.977 --> 09:04.326
People are always like,

09:04.369 --> 09:06.763
"Garrett, he's clever
and funny."

09:06.807 --> 09:09.244
- Okay, then be clever
and funny.

09:09.287 --> 09:12.595
- Well--no, not--
it's not appropriate right now

09:12.639 --> 09:13.727
when we're missing a package.

09:13.770 --> 09:14.989
- I'll set you up for it, okay?

09:15.032 --> 09:17.382
A Polish guy and a blonde
walk into a bar.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.819
- What?
- Come on, man.

09:18.862 --> 09:20.516
I put you on the one yard line.

09:22.039 --> 09:23.998
- Your total is $3.89.

09:24.041 --> 09:25.477
Would you like to round up
for charity?

09:25.521 --> 09:27.001
- Not today, thanks.

09:27.044 --> 09:30.352
- Hey, Sandra, aren't these
your favorite kind of chips?

09:31.745 --> 09:34.138
- Yes.
I love these chips.

09:34.182 --> 09:36.271
- Oh.
Cool.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.925
- Uh-huh.

09:37.968 --> 09:39.666
You're a lucky man.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.364
And these are some lucky chips

09:42.407 --> 09:44.409
'cause they get to take a ride

09:44.453 --> 09:46.368
in that hot little mouth
of yours.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.025
Nope.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.854
Oh, my God.
I have to call Jerry.

09:53.897 --> 09:55.203
Jerry?

09:55.246 --> 09:59.076
Jonah made me seduce a man.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.297
- Would you say you have
a unique management style?

10:02.340 --> 10:04.299
- Yeah.
Yeah, I would say that.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.214
- Could you actually say it
just so I can quote you?

10:06.257 --> 10:08.738
- Everything's pulling teeth
with this one.

10:08.782 --> 10:09.870
It's like, what are you,
a dentist?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.393
I mean, come on--
- Jeff!

10:11.436 --> 10:12.699
Enough.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.832
Listen, I am a working mother,

10:15.876 --> 10:18.182
and I came up from the floor,

10:18.226 --> 10:19.706
but it was worth it

10:19.749 --> 10:23.884
because as a manager, I know
what my people need from me,

10:23.927 --> 10:25.799
so it might seem silly,

10:25.842 --> 10:27.888
but small things
like healthy snacks

10:27.931 --> 10:29.454
actually make a difference.

10:29.498 --> 10:31.152
- Yikes, Amy.
Brag much?

10:31.195 --> 10:33.067
- Hey, Jeff, why don't you
give us a minute?

10:33.110 --> 10:36.418
Maybe go grab a coffee
or literally anything?

10:36.461 --> 10:39.160
- I'm not clear
whether I report to you or not,

10:39.203 --> 10:42.076
so I am gonna grab that coffee.

10:45.253 --> 10:47.734
- Wait, what's this doing
in here?

10:47.777 --> 10:49.474
- Oh.
Wow.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.868
Oh, there's a note.
Looks like there's a note.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.828
Why don't you look at the note?
Wonder what that note says.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.700
Why don't you read the note?

10:57.744 --> 11:00.355
- "Cheyenne,
thought you could use this.

11:00.398 --> 11:02.487
From your guardian angel."

11:02.531 --> 11:04.359
Aww.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.144
Whoa, there's a lot of stuff
in here.

11:07.188 --> 11:10.060
Gift certificates,
grocery coupons,

11:10.104 --> 11:11.888
and an e-reader?

11:11.932 --> 11:14.761
Nice, I could sell this
to some nerd and make bank.

11:14.804 --> 11:16.327
- Wow, you're so lucky.

11:16.371 --> 11:19.113
- Yes.
Lucky ducky, quack quack.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.941
- What, don't you think
it's nice

11:20.984 --> 11:23.117
that someone helped out
Cheyenne?

11:23.160 --> 11:25.162
- Oh, yeah,
but where's my guardian angel?

11:25.206 --> 11:28.078
I've got two kids
and an underwater mortgage.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.211
- And my heat broke,
so I have to stay with friends.

11:30.254 --> 11:31.734
I have lots of offers,

11:31.778 --> 11:33.693
but if anyone wants to throw
their hat into the ring.

11:33.736 --> 11:37.000
- Wow, looks like lots of folks
are having a rough time, huh?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.306
- Yeah, but it figures

11:38.349 --> 11:40.656
only Cheyenne
would get a care package.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.790
I bet this guardian angel
is just some sort of pervert.

11:43.833 --> 11:46.096
- What?
No!

11:46.140 --> 11:48.577
- I mean, unless you mean
a pervert for giving.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.622
- I mean a pervert
for pervin'.

11:50.666 --> 11:52.624
- Guys, I'm sure
the guardian angel

11:52.668 --> 11:54.801
is gonna give everyone
a care package.

11:54.844 --> 11:57.717
Otherwise, it's just unfair.

12:01.764 --> 12:03.592
- Ah, I was probably 25

12:03.635 --> 12:05.463
when I finally heard
of dryer sheets.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.075
Before that, it was just like
wrinkles, shminkles, you know.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.164
Let's hit the club.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.861
- You know who else
likes dryer sheets?

12:11.905 --> 12:15.735
Jonah's girlfriend.
Which he has.

12:15.778 --> 12:17.301
Your total is $26.17.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.999
- Oh, I'll round up
for charity.

12:19.042 --> 12:21.871
- No.
No rounding up.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.831
Not like this.

12:24.874 --> 12:26.746
- Are you--

12:26.789 --> 12:29.444
sorry, thank you so much.

12:29.487 --> 12:31.620
Sandra, you have to stop.

12:31.663 --> 12:34.188
I know you and Jerry don't,
like, talk to a lot of people,

12:34.231 --> 12:36.930
but this is just
meaningless banter.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.193
- 'Scuse me. 'Scuse me.
Hi. Jonah.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.369
- Oh, hey, yeah.
You were here before.

12:41.412 --> 12:43.371
- Yeah, Judy, yeah.
Culinary student.

12:43.414 --> 12:46.069
- Yeah, right.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.897
- Yeah, I don't usually
do this,

12:47.941 --> 12:51.509
and maybe I'm crazy,
but I feel like we had a...

12:51.553 --> 12:52.641
connection.

12:52.684 --> 12:53.990
- Ah.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.209
- And I just--
I'm just wondering,

12:55.252 --> 12:57.602
would you like to have coffee
sometime?

12:57.646 --> 12:58.821
- You know what?

12:58.865 --> 13:00.954
I did enjoy our--
our friendly conversation.

13:00.997 --> 13:03.434
- Mm-hmm.
- So why not?

13:03.478 --> 13:05.567
- Oh, good.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.917
- And Eddie in bakery
does this drag show,

13:07.961 --> 13:10.137
so I usually just give him
our extra packing material

13:10.180 --> 13:11.268
for hip and boob pads.

13:11.312 --> 13:12.530
I love that.

13:12.574 --> 13:13.705
- Yeah, I mean, you know,

13:13.749 --> 13:15.055
it's just like
this event today.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.404
All you have to do
is show you care.

13:16.447 --> 13:17.797
I really think
that's a big reason

13:17.840 --> 13:19.755
why I've been able to earn
my employees' respect.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.757
- Rodriguez.
Over here.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.585
Now.

13:23.628 --> 13:26.240
- She calls me--
I've never known--

13:26.283 --> 13:28.024
it's not racist, I don't think.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.330
'Scuse me.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.592
I've told you

13:30.635 --> 13:32.202
not to call me that
in front of people.

13:32.246 --> 13:33.856
- How's the interview going?

13:33.900 --> 13:36.032
- Honestly, really great,

13:36.076 --> 13:37.425
and I know that sounds braggy,

13:37.468 --> 13:39.514
but bragging is really working
for me right now.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.950
I think I've won her over.

13:40.994 --> 13:42.430
- Oh, that is awesome.

13:42.473 --> 13:43.997
That means it probably won't
even matter

13:44.040 --> 13:45.868
when this whole thing
goes to .

13:45.912 --> 13:47.739
- What?
- We're short on care packages.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.263
There won't be enough
once the next bus arrives.

13:49.306 --> 13:50.351
I probably should've led
with that,

13:50.394 --> 13:51.439
but you just kept talking
and talking

13:51.482 --> 13:52.875
about how great you're doing.

13:52.919 --> 13:55.835
Anyway, guess these needy women
are gonna stay needy.

14:02.580 --> 14:04.147
- How is this possible?

14:04.191 --> 14:05.453
I made sure
that there were enough

14:05.496 --> 14:06.758
for everybody coming.

14:06.802 --> 14:08.630
- Stealing from the poor?
Ugh.

14:08.673 --> 14:10.719
There's a special place
in hell.

14:10.762 --> 14:13.504
- Yeah, or maybe, like,
the worst part of heaven.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.506
- This is a Class C felony.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.118
20 care packages valued at,
what, 500 bucks a pop?

14:18.161 --> 14:19.554
- 10,000.
That's the total.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.035
- I mean, who would even--

14:22.078 --> 14:23.471
wait.

14:23.514 --> 14:25.168
Could this be Jeff?

14:25.212 --> 14:27.040
I don't know why,
but he has been trying

14:27.083 --> 14:28.911
to tear me down all day today.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.174
- Okay, don't be mad,

14:31.218 --> 14:32.610
but I think it's because
I told him

14:32.654 --> 14:34.961
that you set me up
with your brother.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.876
- Mateo.
Why would you even--

14:36.919 --> 14:38.355
- I said don't be mad!

14:38.399 --> 14:40.531
- Okay, fine, just--

14:40.575 --> 14:43.360
go stall Isabel
and we'll go talk to Jeff.

14:43.404 --> 14:45.058
I can't believe he would stoop
this low.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.887
- I mean, love makes you do
crazy things.

14:47.930 --> 14:49.366
- You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

14:49.410 --> 14:51.586
- I'm trying not to!

14:53.370 --> 14:55.503
- Jeff, what the hell?

14:55.546 --> 14:56.852
- You've got a lot of gall.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.419
In fact, if I measured
your gall level,

14:58.462 --> 15:00.160
you would break
the gall level device.

15:00.203 --> 15:03.728
- It's called revenge, Amy.
I did what I had to do.

15:03.772 --> 15:06.775
- What, you did--you did?
Are you sure?

15:06.818 --> 15:09.082
- How is stealing packages
from poor people

15:09.125 --> 15:10.518
"what you had to do?"

15:10.561 --> 15:12.302
- What?
No, I didn't take any packages.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.870
I just--I farted
in your office.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.306
- Ew.
What?

15:16.350 --> 15:18.961
- But if somebody is taking
packages from a charity,

15:19.005 --> 15:20.093
that's a horrible person.

15:20.136 --> 15:21.398
- Yeah, I mean,

15:21.442 --> 15:22.965
unless they're doing something

15:23.009 --> 15:25.054
equally charitable
with the packages,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.969
but, you know, that would be
really hard to know.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.971
- Well, the next bus is gonna
get here in 20 minutes.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.407
What am I gonna give
these women?

15:30.451 --> 15:32.322
- Why don't we just give them
some cash?

15:32.366 --> 15:33.671
I'm happy to contribute.
I've got--

15:33.715 --> 15:35.238
- Glenn, don't worry about it.

15:35.282 --> 15:38.459
I'll go figure out how to not
send them away empty-handed.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.637
- If you ever fart

15:42.680 --> 15:45.292
in my best friend's office
again,

15:45.335 --> 15:47.642
it will be the last fart
you ever fart.

15:51.559 --> 15:53.213
- I got you this.

15:53.256 --> 15:56.129
This is a map
of the night stars

15:56.172 --> 15:59.393
over St. Louis where we met.

15:59.436 --> 16:02.787
- That's--ah, wow,
that is so...

16:02.831 --> 16:06.878
useful to anyone in St. Louis,
really.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.271
- I just--I just--

16:08.315 --> 16:11.622
oh, you just make me feel
so electric

16:11.666 --> 16:13.494
since you started
flirting with me.

16:13.537 --> 16:16.801
- I mean, that is just--

16:18.064 --> 16:19.674
No, no, no, no.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.328
Sorry.
I'm so sorry, Judy.

16:21.371 --> 16:24.026
I just--this--I think
there was a misunderstanding.

16:24.070 --> 16:26.289
- Oh.
- I was only being friendly.

16:26.333 --> 16:29.031
I was definitely not flirting.

16:29.075 --> 16:32.034
I guess I felt
that that was understood

16:32.078 --> 16:34.950
because we're--obviously!

16:34.994 --> 16:37.866
I mean, not obvious,
'cause you know,

16:37.909 --> 16:40.782
you're gorgeous really,
for your cohort.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.523
- He was just doing it
for charity.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.046
So you'd round up.

16:44.090 --> 16:45.352
- Oh, oh--oh, you did this--

16:45.395 --> 16:47.963
you did this to me
for 57 cents?

16:48.007 --> 16:50.183
Oh, I feel so stupid.
- No.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.881
- Oh, my God,
is this what catfishing is?

16:52.924 --> 16:55.057
No, no, no, no, it's not.

16:55.101 --> 16:57.146
- Catfishing is--
- No, not the time.

16:57.190 --> 16:59.322
- What?
- Tell you later.

16:59.366 --> 17:02.108
- Sorry for the wait, ladies.

17:02.151 --> 17:03.892
Here you go.
Zephra cares.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.373
You can wait till you're on
the bus to open those.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.418
- There's just tape

17:08.462 --> 17:11.160
and some loose grapes in here.

17:11.204 --> 17:12.770
- Oh!
Ooh.

17:12.814 --> 17:16.948
You got the antioxidant
package.

17:16.992 --> 17:18.124
- Yes.

17:18.167 --> 17:20.082
Grapes are so important
for the skin,

17:20.126 --> 17:23.825
and skin is so important
for the face.

17:23.868 --> 17:25.000
- Mm-hmm.

17:25.044 --> 17:27.089
- Then how come I didn't get
any grapes?

17:27.133 --> 17:31.093
- Well, all of the packages
are different because--

17:31.137 --> 17:34.227
because the female experience
is not a monolith,

17:34.270 --> 17:35.619
am I right, gals?

17:35.663 --> 17:40.189
I mean, we don't all
eat grapes.

17:40.233 --> 17:41.495
Right?

17:41.538 --> 17:44.759
- This hairbrush
is clearly used.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.978
- Did you go through my desk?

17:49.633 --> 17:52.071
- You haul us down here just
to give us a bunch of junk?

17:52.114 --> 17:53.289
What is this,
some kind of a joke?

17:53.333 --> 17:54.856
- No, I promise you, this is--

17:54.899 --> 17:56.205
- You think you can treat us
like crap

17:56.249 --> 17:59.121
just because you have
a nice job and a nice coat.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.167
- Ladies, it's not like that.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.212
That coat is from Ross.

18:03.256 --> 18:04.518
- I found the thief.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.563
It was Cheyenne.
She took the care packages.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.436
- I'm telling you, somebody
just put this in my locker.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.395
I haven't stolen anything
in, like, a really long time.

18:12.439 --> 18:15.311
- Okay, I'm sure that there's
an explanation for this.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.357
My employees are not criminals.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.923
Well, actually,
some of them are,

18:18.967 --> 18:20.229
but everyone deserves
a second chance.

18:20.273 --> 18:21.535
This is not the point, Amy.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.711
- It wasn't Cheyenne!

18:23.754 --> 18:26.148
And I know that
because I have a hunch.

18:26.192 --> 18:27.976
I have a very good hunch.

18:28.019 --> 18:29.586
- Wait, it was Glenn.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.632
He's lying right now
because he stole the stuff.

18:31.675 --> 18:33.373
Not so dumb now.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.897
I figured it out.

18:35.940 --> 18:37.290
It was obvious to everyone,
huh?

18:37.333 --> 18:38.639
- Yes.
- Pretty obvious.

18:38.682 --> 18:39.988
- So obvious.
- Yeah, we all got that.

18:40.031 --> 18:41.859
- Yeah.
- Fine!

18:41.903 --> 18:43.165
I gave them to the staff.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.037
- Why?
Glenn, what were you thinking?

18:46.081 --> 18:48.170
- Our people are struggling,
Amy.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.563
- Okay, you know what?

18:49.606 --> 18:52.522
Just--you're gonna have to get
the packages back.

18:52.566 --> 18:53.828
- Oh.

18:53.871 --> 18:55.395
- Well, you almost pulled off
a Robin Hood,

18:55.438 --> 18:56.613
except you gave to the poor

18:56.657 --> 18:58.354
by stealing
from the really poor.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.443
- He's picturing the fox
Robin Hood.

19:00.487 --> 19:03.142
- I'm picturing the man one.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.448
- Your total is $23.87.

19:05.492 --> 19:06.971
Would you like to round up
for charity?

19:07.015 --> 19:10.018
- Sure.
What's 13 cents, right?

19:10.061 --> 19:12.455
- I'd rather not comment
on your finances.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.332
- Jerry.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.290
You didn't have to come.
I told you to forget about it.

19:21.334 --> 19:23.205
- I did,
but then I remembered again.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.685
- Hey, Jerry.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.165
- Sandra told me

19:26.208 --> 19:29.037
you tried to make her do stuff
with men for money.

19:29.080 --> 19:31.300
- What--oh, oh.
Earlier today?

19:31.344 --> 19:33.084
No, that was--
that was just talking.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.652
- Let me make myself
perfectly clear.

19:35.696 --> 19:37.437
I don't like that.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.048
- Jerry, please calm down.

19:40.091 --> 19:42.006
I've never seen him this angry.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.139
- If you ever mess
with my marriage again,

19:44.183 --> 19:47.273
I will hate it.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.796
- Got it.
Understood.

19:48.839 --> 19:51.668
- Sandra, could you bring home
some magazines?

19:51.712 --> 19:52.974
Bye, Jonah.

19:53.017 --> 19:55.585
- Bye, Jer.

19:55.629 --> 19:57.108
Take notes, Jonah.

19:57.152 --> 20:00.155
That's marriage material.

20:00.199 --> 20:03.811
And yes, he reads magazines.

20:06.727 --> 20:09.251
- So probably doesn't look
great for the profile

20:09.295 --> 20:11.297
that we were robbing
the homeless, huh?

20:11.340 --> 20:13.037
- I mean, robbing the homeless

20:13.081 --> 20:16.084
is probably not exactly
how I'll frame it,

20:16.127 --> 20:18.739
but, you know,
it's kind of a nice story.

20:18.782 --> 20:20.654
Coworkers helping each other.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.265
One big Zephra family.

20:23.309 --> 20:25.049
Cheyenne, could you come
over here for a second?

20:25.093 --> 20:26.790
- Oh, yeah, sure.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.403
- I would actually love to get
just, like, a quick shot

20:30.446 --> 20:32.448
of Amy handing you
one of the care packages,

20:32.492 --> 20:35.059
you know, just, like,
helping an employee in need.

20:35.103 --> 20:37.279
- Oh, I'm not in need.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.325
If you wanna talk
to a sad person,

20:39.368 --> 20:40.848
you should go find Justine.

20:40.891 --> 20:43.372
- Yeah, we probably
don't need a photo.

20:43.416 --> 20:46.593
- It'll just take one second.
Great.

20:46.636 --> 20:48.551
- Oh, wait,
so that's gonna end up online,

20:48.595 --> 20:51.424
like, with my face on it
and stuff?

20:51.467 --> 20:52.816
- Mm-hmm.

20:52.860 --> 20:55.254
- Yeah, I think maybe
you don't wanna post those

20:55.297 --> 20:57.256
'cause of, like, optics, right?

20:57.299 --> 20:58.779
I mean, it could come off

20:58.822 --> 21:01.390
that Zephra employees
get paid so little

21:01.434 --> 21:03.305
that they rely on charity to--

21:03.349 --> 21:06.352
- Oh, I don't really think
anyone's connecting those dots.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.832
Plus you guys look so awesome,
right?

21:08.876 --> 21:09.833
Cute.

21:13.184 --> 21:14.664
- She took so many photos
today.

21:14.708 --> 21:16.927
That one probably won't even
get posted.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.756
- It will, Amy.
I'm gorgeous.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.759
Sucks.
