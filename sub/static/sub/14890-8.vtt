00:04.137 --> 00:06.471
And we have something
to celebrate.

00:06.507 --> 00:09.743
The paper is sending me
Los Angeles for the weekend.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.745
Oh, my Lord!

00:11.778 --> 00:13.313
’That’s Marco Madison.’

00:13.346 --> 00:15.115
’He’s very big
in the underworld.’

00:15.148 --> 00:16.617
Balki, tape this for me.

00:20.654 --> 00:21.655
[groans]

00:24.190 --> 00:25.626
Get those guys.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.697
Rosebud.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.767
[screaming]

00:33.800 --> 00:37.103
Cousin, I videotaped the murder.

00:37.137 --> 00:38.539
The, the tape will prove us
innocent.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.374
All we need is to,
to find someplace

00:41.407 --> 00:44.110
where we can play back the tape.

00:44.144 --> 00:47.280
(female newsreader)
The two suspects are considered
armed and dangerous.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.215
Hey, hey, wait, stop!

00:49.249 --> 00:51.351
Balki, get in the car!

00:51.384 --> 00:52.619
Get in the car! Get in the car!

00:52.653 --> 00:53.754
Oh, God! God! God!

00:55.321 --> 00:57.758
Balki, I think
they’re getting closer!

00:57.791 --> 00:59.459
(Balki)
’Oh! Oh! Oh!’

00:59.492 --> 01:02.629
Uh, cousin, don’t worry
about them, worry about that!

Oh! Oh!

02:41.528 --> 02:43.630
I‐I‐I, I hope you know
where we are going

02:43.664 --> 02:45.932
because the street map
was in the sun visor.

02:53.439 --> 02:54.641
Balki, there’s Jennifer
and Mary Anne.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.777
Hey, Jennifer and Mary Anne!

02:59.746 --> 03:02.382
Jennifer! Jennifer, Mary Anne!

03:02.415 --> 03:03.984
Quick, get in the car.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.386
Why has the top of this car
been torn off?

03:06.419 --> 03:09.289
Please, get in the car first
and then I’ll explain.

03:13.293 --> 03:14.494
Now, what’s going on?

03:14.528 --> 03:16.462
Well, there’s a very simple
explanation for all of this.

03:16.496 --> 03:17.931
It could have happened
to anybody.

03:17.964 --> 03:18.932
We were at the wedding

03:18.965 --> 03:20.934
and I didn’t have an angle
for my story‐‐

03:20.967 --> 03:22.569
Cousin, eyes on the road.

03:22.603 --> 03:25.305
Well, suddenly I saw
Marco Madison big time gangster

03:25.338 --> 03:26.540
and, and, and Balki and I

03:26.573 --> 03:27.974
followed him and his pals
to the garage

03:28.008 --> 03:31.978
where Marco Madison killed
this guy and we videotaped it.

03:32.012 --> 03:33.413
Excuse me, cousin, we?

03:33.446 --> 03:34.781
Anyway, the dead guy

03:34.815 --> 03:37.651
turned out to be
an undercover drug agent.

03:37.684 --> 03:38.852
So you’re wanted for murder

03:38.885 --> 03:41.287
because Marco Madison
killed this guy?

03:41.321 --> 03:44.490
No. We’re wanted for murder
because the guy died in my arms

03:44.525 --> 03:46.793
while I was holding
the murder weapon.

03:46.827 --> 03:47.961
It was the weirdest thing,
Jennifer.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.897
He looked up at me and said,
"Rosebud."

03:50.931 --> 03:53.366
But, Larry, if Balki
videotaped the murder

03:53.399 --> 03:55.301
why don’t you just
take the tape to the police?

03:55.335 --> 03:57.804
Because we have no idea
what’s on the tape.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.874
We’ve got to get to a TV
before Marco’s men get to us.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.409
Cousin, there’s a TV!

04:04.745 --> 04:06.847

04:14.788 --> 04:16.757
Come on! Let’s go
take a look at this tape!

Wait here where it’s safe.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.301
Right.

04:40.947 --> 04:42.916
Welcome to Roy’s Tattoo Parlor.

04:45.686 --> 04:48.622
‐I’m Roy.
‐I’m Balki.

04:48.655 --> 04:50.356
You want a tattoo
or did you just come in

04:50.390 --> 04:52.425
to enjoy the...ambience?

04:53.894 --> 04:56.496
He wants a tattoo. Uh, can I use
your TV for just a moment?

04:56.530 --> 04:57.631
Okay.

04:57.664 --> 04:59.566
So which tattoo would you like?

04:59.600 --> 05:01.034
Oh!

05:01.067 --> 05:03.069
Well, I don’t know.
What’s a tattoo?

05:04.638 --> 05:05.839
Those are tattoos.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.810
[static]

05:11.444 --> 05:13.647
Hey, cousin, look at these.
These are beautiful.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.517
Look, cousin,
he’s got a, a snake

05:16.550 --> 05:20.587
slithering through the eye
sockets of a human skull.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.022
And, uh, and...

05:22.055 --> 05:24.090
Oh, there’s Regis
and Kathie Lee.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.897
Hey, cousin, which tattoo
you think I should get.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.066
One you can enjoy in prison
for the rest of your life.

05:33.099 --> 05:35.536
’Cause we got nothin’,
but static.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.538
So which tattoo
do you want, pal?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.540
‐What’s that?
‐That’s a tattoo needle.

05:39.573 --> 05:42.375
‐Which tattoo do you want?
‐Uh...

05:42.408 --> 05:44.144
Well, I‐I don’t know.
What‐what have you got?

05:44.177 --> 05:45.912
I’ll show you what I got.

05:47.447 --> 05:48.448
Ah!

05:49.916 --> 05:53.019
Well, uh, do, do,
do you have the "Muppet Babies?"

05:53.053 --> 05:55.121
Ooh, that’s our second most
requested number.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.425
Most people want a cobra
on their face.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.130
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
there’s something on the tape!

06:06.166 --> 06:09.536
‐’You don’t lie to me.’
‐I’m not lying.

Now we have proof
that we are innocent!

06:25.118 --> 06:26.720
This isn’t going to hurt, is it?

06:26.753 --> 06:28.054
Oh, of course not.

07:31.752 --> 07:34.588
Balki, I think we’re safe.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.358
You know...

07:38.391 --> 07:41.928
There’s something about this
whole thing that smells rotten.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.197
It’s us, cousin, we were
just sitting in garbage.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.232
No, I mean...

07:52.205 --> 07:53.874
No, I mean

07:53.907 --> 07:56.543
why would
a respectable politician

07:56.577 --> 07:58.979
invite a gangster
to his wedding?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.280
If I can just
figure out the connection

08:00.313 --> 08:03.149
between Marco Madison
and Commissioner Albrecht

08:03.183 --> 08:05.018
I think I’ve got
a front page story.

08:05.051 --> 08:07.688
Balki, I think things
might be looking up.

08:07.721 --> 08:08.755
Well, think again.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.991
Give me all your money
or I’ll blow you away!

08:13.326 --> 08:14.928
Okay, okay.

08:14.961 --> 08:17.130
Uh, here’s my money.

08:17.998 --> 08:19.566
Is that all of it?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.201
Well, uh, to be perfectly honest

08:21.234 --> 08:23.136
no, no, th‐that isn’t all of it

08:23.169 --> 08:26.239
and you‐you did ask
for, for all my money.

08:26.272 --> 08:28.842
So, so, uh, fair is fair.

08:28.875 --> 08:31.177
Here you go.

08:31.211 --> 08:33.847
I didn’t mean to lie.
I’m, I’m sorry about that.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.816
So you want to take this?

08:35.849 --> 08:37.951
This is a locket that...

08:37.984 --> 08:39.720
This is an heirloom
in my family.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.855
My, my, my mother gave me this

08:41.888 --> 08:43.924
and she wept
as she gave it to me.

‐If you look inside‐‐
‐Balki!

08:45.659 --> 08:46.827
How about you, shorty?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.895
Oh, uh, uh, alright.

08:48.929 --> 08:52.332
Here, here, uh, here you go.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.601
Now, give me the VCR.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.070
No. No, no, not the‐the VCR.

08:57.103 --> 08:59.139
No, no, here.
Here, take my watch.

08:59.172 --> 09:01.141
Take my cufflinks,
or‐or‐or give us your address

09:01.174 --> 09:02.876
I’ll send you a big check.

09:02.909 --> 09:04.811
Yeah, I’ll take that,
but I still want the VCR.

09:04.845 --> 09:07.714
No, no, no, no. Don’t‐don’t
don’t take the‐the‐the VCR.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.315
Don’t‐don’t‐don’t...
Bal‐Balki, give him something!

09:09.349 --> 09:12.919
Uh, can I, can I offer you
my shoes?

09:12.953 --> 09:16.189
Now these are hand‐made
of the finest goat bladder.

09:16.222 --> 09:17.958
Look at the detail work on this.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.760
I don’t know what...
What size shoe are you?

09:19.793 --> 09:22.128
‐The VCR!
‐No, don’t take the VCR.

09:22.162 --> 09:24.665
Take something else.
Take, take, take him.

09:27.634 --> 09:28.635
Hold this.

09:29.703 --> 09:31.071
Give me that!

09:32.973 --> 09:34.775
‐Thanks.
‐Well, you’re most welcome.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.210
‐Nice doing business with you.
‐You forgot your shoes.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.948
He took the VCR.

09:42.949 --> 09:45.051
He took the evidence.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.654
We’re goin’ to jail.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.190
Oh, no, cousin,
we‐we‐we’re not going to jail.

09:50.223 --> 09:53.226
‐We’re not?
‐Well, no, no, no.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.630
Marco’s men will kill us first,
you silly.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.974
We were so close.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.843
Another few minutes
a‐and‐and the police

10:09.876 --> 10:12.178
would have had the tape, our
names would have been cleared.

10:12.212 --> 10:15.215
But no‐o‐o,
we had to get mugged.

10:15.248 --> 10:18.685
We could’ve stayed in Chicago
and gotten mugged.

10:18.719 --> 10:21.354
You know. You know, cousin,
I’ve been thinking.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.857
Maybe that mugger
will play the tape

10:23.890 --> 10:26.993
see that we’re innocent
and bring it to the police.

10:27.027 --> 10:28.261
Right.

10:28.294 --> 10:29.996
And maybe pigs will fly.

10:30.030 --> 10:31.732
No, cousin,
that don’t usually happen

10:31.765 --> 10:35.135
unless the pig
gets a good running start.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.903
‐’Seventy five dollars?’
‐’Yeah.’

10:39.139 --> 10:40.841
That’s him.

10:40.874 --> 10:42.976
This has an 18 day timer.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.746
You can get yourself
like 32 tapes...

10:45.779 --> 10:47.280
That’s our VCR.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.418
Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.988
Uh, th‐th‐that’s our VCR
and we need it back.

10:55.021 --> 10:56.322
Sheila,
it’s the crazy men again.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.224
Alright!
You give us back our car

10:58.258 --> 10:59.359
and our bike
and we’ll talk about it.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.161
W‐w‐we can’t do that.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.997
B‐b‐but that’s our VCR.
It was stolen from us.

11:04.030 --> 11:04.898
Who cares?

11:04.931 --> 11:07.167
Herb, I told you
this thing was stolen.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.001
We never should have bought it.

11:08.034 --> 11:10.070
But did you
ever listen to me? No.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.038
Put a sock in it, Sheila.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.007
This is the worst vacation
we ever had.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.843
Gettin’ this machine for $50
is the only good thing

11:16.877 --> 11:18.478
that’s happened
since we left the corn belt!

11:18.512 --> 11:20.413
Okay, we don’t need the machine.

11:20.446 --> 11:22.916
Just give us the video cassette.

11:22.949 --> 11:24.751
Hmm, that seems fair, Herb.

11:24.785 --> 11:28.188
Oh, that is so very kind.
Where are you from?

11:28.221 --> 11:31.057
‐Danville, Illinois.
‐Get out of the city!

11:31.091 --> 11:33.093
‐We’re from Chicago!
‐No!

11:33.126 --> 11:35.495
No, I’m not kidding you!
Is that a coinc...

11:35.529 --> 11:38.164
We should exchange addresses
so that we can write.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.766
Absolutely. Yes, I‐‐

11:39.800 --> 11:41.001
‐Balki!
‐Sheila!

11:44.505 --> 11:46.206
Give us that video cassette.

Ah!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.469
Yes!

12:16.503 --> 12:18.972
Alright, Balki, now we go
straight to the police

12:19.005 --> 12:21.241
give them this tape,
and tonight we’re at Disneyland

12:21.274 --> 12:23.343
in time for the Main Street
Electrical Parade.

12:23.376 --> 12:26.847

we do the Dance of Joy!

I’m so sorry.

‐Well, I was, he‐he was...

with you in a moment.

Oh, that’s okay.

Oh, now, I’m sure
Mr. Madison is quite a busy man.

13:32.278 --> 13:34.114
I’m so scared!

13:39.485 --> 13:40.987
There must be some kind of way
out of here.

13:47.528 --> 13:49.530
Cousin, cousin, cousin,
if we can get out here

13:49.563 --> 13:51.097
we can jump out the window.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.101
Balki, we’re 25 feet
off the ground.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.638
No, cousin, we can jump
onto that truck. See?

13:57.671 --> 14:01.107
Right there. The one that says
"Rosebud Trucking Company."

14:01.141 --> 14:02.408
"Rosebud?"

14:04.444 --> 14:06.647
Balki, just before the federal

14:06.680 --> 14:08.549
drug agent died,
he said, "Rosebud."

14:08.582 --> 14:11.451
He must have been talking
about Rosebud Trucking Company.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.053
And that must mean
Marco is using

14:13.086 --> 14:16.590
Rosebud Trucking Company
to transfer drugs illegally.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.158

’Very good.’

14:18.191 --> 14:20.594
You put everything together.

Now as soon as you
give me your videotape

14:23.396 --> 14:25.365
you two will be
pushing up daisies.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.100
I love daisies.

14:27.133 --> 14:30.170
Especially the little white ones
or the little pink ones.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.438
For some reason I’m not
that fond of the yellow ones.

14:32.472 --> 14:35.976
I mean you’ll be
sleeping with the fishes!

14:36.009 --> 14:39.379
I love fishes,
but I‐I’ve never slept with one.

14:39.412 --> 14:43.349
Balki, he means
he’s going to kill us.

14:43.383 --> 14:47.420
And I’m supposed to figure this
out from fish and daisies?

14:47.453 --> 14:51.124
You see, you two can link me
to the drug shipments.

14:51.157 --> 14:53.359
And you saw the murder.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.296

a‐a‐about Mr. Potter,
the shop teacher.

15:07.073 --> 15:09.042
To this day
I haven’t told anyone.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.177
Cousin, is that
the same Mr. Potter

15:11.211 --> 15:14.214
that was also Mrs. Olsen,
the substitute home EC teacher?

15:20.220 --> 15:21.922
What’s going on here?

15:23.156 --> 15:25.025
Darla!

15:25.058 --> 15:28.962
Cousin, this,
this is one special woman

15:28.995 --> 15:31.698
taking time off from her
honeymoon to come and save us.

15:31.732 --> 15:34.067
But no, Darla,
this is a dangerous place.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.335
Save yourself.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.737
Are you finished?

15:36.770 --> 15:38.705
Yes, but I was wondering
why I never got

15:38.739 --> 15:41.307
that autographed picture
that I sent for?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.043
Although you have been busy
with the, uh

15:43.076 --> 15:44.210
the wedding and all.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.147
Kill him first.

No, Darla, you‐you don’t
want to kill us

it’s your housekeeper’s
illegitimate son‐in‐law

who’s been putting the poison
in your diet shake.

15:55.656 --> 15:58.091
Balki, you don’t get it.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.626
She and her crooked
commissioner husband

15:59.660 --> 16:01.494
are obviously in on this.

16:01.528 --> 16:03.496
It’s the last piece
of the puzzle.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.999
Get the tape and then,
get rid of them.

16:10.671 --> 16:13.439
‐Give me the tape.
‐Why should I?

Because if you don’t, I’ll fix
it so your knees bend both ways.

‐Well, it gets better.

You see, in just a little bit
the Road Runner gets away

16:42.435 --> 16:44.605

bashes into a brick wall.

Oh, look, look!

16:47.674 --> 16:49.042
Balki, what did you
do with the tape?

16:49.075 --> 16:50.276
Yeah, what did you
do with the tape?

16:50.310 --> 16:51.512
Well, that’s for you to know

16:51.545 --> 16:53.413
and me to find out, bucko!

16:53.446 --> 16:55.115
I may be a simple Mypiot boy

to have switched the tapes.

and some barbed wire!

to make a goat pen?

No.

He’s gonna hurt us.

17:05.425 --> 17:09.128
Oh, ha, I was really hoping we
were going to make a goat pen.

Just leave him to me.
I’ll make him talk.

Aah!

Tell me where you put the tape!

Ow!

We’ll take you to the tape
if you promise not to kill us.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.311
Okay. That sounds fair to me.

17:28.682 --> 17:31.151
But if you mess around with me

17:31.184 --> 17:34.320
I’m gonna rip your heart out
right through your ear!

the tape, they’re gonna kill us.

favorite party game?

21:09.435 --> 21:10.604
Are you okay?

21:16.910 --> 21:18.344
We were really lucky.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.713
When Jennifer and Mary Anne
went to the police

21:19.746 --> 21:20.981
they found out
the police already

21:21.014 --> 21:22.082
had Marco under surveillance.

21:22.115 --> 21:25.051
So all they had to do
was close in and arrest him.

21:25.085 --> 21:27.387
We were minutes away
from certain death.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.455
But the exciting part
is after that

21:29.489 --> 21:30.957
we bought maps
to the stars homes

21:30.991 --> 21:34.928
and I got to shake hands
with Pat Sajak’s gardener!

21:34.961 --> 21:37.397
Well, what excites me
is that the story went national

21:37.430 --> 21:38.832
and we beat every paper
in the country

21:38.865 --> 21:40.601
including the "Washington Post."

21:40.634 --> 21:42.636
‐Nice work, boys.
‐Thank you, sir.

21:46.106 --> 21:49.676
You know, Appleton, when I made
you an investigative reporter

21:49.710 --> 21:52.045
everyone on the paper
said I was an idiot.

21:52.078 --> 21:53.780
But you proved them wrong.

21:53.814 --> 21:54.815
Well, thank you, sir.

21:54.848 --> 21:56.850
I’m glad I could prove
you’re not an idiot.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.388
Boy, cousin,
that was one scary weekend.

22:02.422 --> 22:03.757
I hope we never
have to go through

22:03.790 --> 22:05.358
anything like that again.

22:05.391 --> 22:07.894
Well, you know, Balki,
as an investigative reporter

22:07.928 --> 22:10.664
I’m gonna have to get used
to living on the edge.

22:11.865 --> 22:15.001
I have to confess I,
I kind of enjoyed

22:15.035 --> 22:18.404
mixing it up with men
who were trying to kill us.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.140
They thought they had us
on the run.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.042
Huh, they were lucky

when they did.

22:26.446 --> 22:27.648

have to learn

if they’re gonna mess with
Larry "Lock‐em‐up" Appleton...
