WEBVTT

00:09.259 --> 00:10.760
Ba-bum.

00:12.137 --> 00:13.138
[croaks]

00:14.639 --> 00:15.890
[panting]

00:17.016 --> 00:19.811
[Viren]  Previously on  The Dragon Prince...

00:20.353 --> 00:23.648
So, the most important things,
I've written down.

00:25.608 --> 00:26.526
A letter?

00:29.279 --> 00:33.366
Queen Aanya, would you allow me
to share a story with you?

00:33.950 --> 00:38.496
Nine years ago, my oldest friend,
Prince Harrow,

00:38.580 --> 00:41.207
became the king of Katolis.

00:42.459 --> 00:47.046
But one day, two visitors came
from a faraway place, another kingdom.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.299
[Aanya]  They were my parents.

00:49.924 --> 00:55.889
This winter, we will run out of food,
and a hundred thousand people will die.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.933
I can use the heart of the titan

00:59.017 --> 01:01.436
in a powerful spell
that will warm the land,

01:01.519 --> 01:04.689
and allow us
to magically grow an incredible bounty.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.619
[roaring]

01:19.496 --> 01:21.498
[theme music playing]

01:36.262 --> 01:37.597
[roaring]

02:07.919 --> 02:09.129
[sighs]

02:12.507 --> 02:13.675
[Harrow]  Dear Callum...

02:14.968 --> 02:17.220
Over the years,
there have been moments

02:17.303 --> 02:19.430
when I let there be a distance between us.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.808
Because I'm your stepfather,

02:21.891 --> 02:24.102
I was trying to give you
the space I thought you needed

02:24.185 --> 02:27.355
to love your real father,
even though he passed away.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.068
Now, I wonder
if I should have held you closer.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.862
I wonder if showing you

02:33.945 --> 02:35.864
how much I loved you
would have been okay,

02:35.947 --> 02:38.867
and would not have disrespected
your relationship with him.

02:44.539 --> 02:46.958
Callum, I know I'm not your birth father.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.087
But in my eyes and in my heart,
you are my son.

02:51.713 --> 02:54.424
I see myself in you. I'm proud of you.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.302
And I love you unconditionally.

02:58.219 --> 02:59.387
[exhales deeply]

03:00.179 --> 03:01.973
Oh, this isn't easy.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.058
[croaks and whimpers]

03:04.142 --> 03:06.352
Wait. You can't read, can you?

03:06.436 --> 03:08.438
[snorts]

03:11.190 --> 03:13.401
[Harrow]  As I write this,
the sun is setting

03:13.484 --> 03:16.237
while Moonshadow assassins
prepare to end my life.

03:16.946 --> 03:20.033
A few months ago,
I took my revenge on Xadia.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.702
Tonight, it is their turn.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.664
I may not have long.
So I'm forced to ask myself...

03:28.124 --> 03:31.878
what can I pass on to my sons
in the short time I have left?

03:31.961 --> 03:34.297
In this letter, I will share with you

03:34.380 --> 03:38.259
a lie, a wish, and a secret.

03:44.098 --> 03:45.099
[Viren] Where is he?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.060
[stammering] Sorry, sorry.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.812
[chuckles] I'm not used to hearing
so much story all at once.

03:49.896 --> 03:53.608
I just needed a quick trip
to the little king's room. [chuckles]

03:54.442 --> 03:56.444
May I continue?

03:56.527 --> 03:58.404
I am ready to hear more, Lord Viren.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.657
Though I know how this story ends,

04:00.740 --> 04:05.328
it warms my heart to hear about my parents
from someone who was there.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.789
Yes. You must know as well as anyone

04:07.872 --> 04:11.292
that while this appears to be
a story of epic battles

04:11.376 --> 04:13.127
and legendary creatures,

04:13.711 --> 04:18.258
it is ultimately a story of sacrifice
and love.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.969
[horse whinnies]

04:21.761 --> 04:23.513
[shouting]

04:24.138 --> 04:25.306
[roaring]

04:25.390 --> 04:26.432
[soldiers groaning]

04:29.894 --> 04:31.312
[roaring]

04:31.396 --> 04:32.397
[soldiers screaming]

04:32.939 --> 04:34.023
[gasps]

04:44.409 --> 04:45.785
[roars]

04:50.415 --> 04:51.416
[soldier] Fire!

04:52.083 --> 04:53.293
[roars]

04:55.795 --> 04:58.881
Aim for the cracks
between the rocky plates!

04:59.299 --> 05:00.383
We can chain it down!

05:07.807 --> 05:09.058
[roaring]

05:14.397 --> 05:15.690
[sizzling]

05:15.773 --> 05:16.858
[roaring]

05:23.197 --> 05:24.157
[gasps]

05:25.199 --> 05:26.576
[Harrow] Take aim at the center.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.745
Fire right where we cracked into it.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.710
[roaring]

05:43.634 --> 05:45.053
[screaming]

05:45.762 --> 05:46.596
Now what?

05:46.679 --> 05:47.889
Push!

05:49.766 --> 05:50.892
Over the edge!

05:55.104 --> 05:56.898
[roaring]

06:07.075 --> 06:08.367
[roars]

06:14.332 --> 06:16.250
[Sarai screaming]

06:18.169 --> 06:19.462
[grunts]

06:25.927 --> 06:27.553
[roars]

06:41.317 --> 06:42.527
[horse neighing]

06:58.584 --> 06:59.418
[sighs]

07:12.223 --> 07:14.600
The legend was true.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.727
The heart of the titan

07:16.811 --> 07:20.398
radiates with life and magic.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.733
So, do you think you can--

07:22.817 --> 07:24.861
Yes. We can save them all.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.991
[all cheering]

07:30.908 --> 07:32.743
Our people, they'll be fed.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.006
Amaya, you did it!

07:47.425 --> 07:48.509
Sister?

07:50.636 --> 07:51.471
Amaya!

08:08.154 --> 08:11.574
Time is short.
There's barely an hour until sunrise.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.202
We can't risk the wrath
of the Dragon King.

08:14.285 --> 08:16.204
We must take the heart and hurry back.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.998
Yes, of course. We'll move as fast we can.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.502
[Viren sighs]

08:22.585 --> 08:24.921
The wounded must be left behind.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.632
We can't afford to slow down.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.513
"You don't need to whisper, Viren.

08:33.596 --> 08:34.639
I'm deaf.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.974
It'll be okay.

08:37.558 --> 08:41.020
Once I rest a bit,
I can make it back by myself."

08:41.103 --> 08:43.064
We won't leave you here alone.

08:43.147 --> 08:45.900
I'll stay with Amaya.
We'll make it home together.

08:45.983 --> 08:47.944
Everyone else should take the heart back.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.112
They agree. Time is of the essence.

08:50.863 --> 08:52.990
-No.
-But Harrow, they just said--

08:53.074 --> 08:56.869
We leave no one behind.
We do not leave our wounded.

08:57.703 --> 09:00.248
You wouldn't do this if it...
if it wasn't your wife's sister.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.918
I've made my decision and it is final.

09:10.216 --> 09:13.219
[Harrow]  When I am gone,
your brother Ezran will become king,

09:13.302 --> 09:17.139
and you will be his partner, his defender,
and his closest adviser.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.101
Soon you will both face a lie.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.145
The great lie of history.

09:25.106 --> 09:28.943
Advisers and scholars will tell you
that history is a narrative of strength.

09:29.527 --> 09:33.489
They will recount stories of the rise
and fall of nations and empires.

09:34.073 --> 09:38.494
They will be stories of armies, battles,
and decisive victories.

09:40.871 --> 09:42.873
But this isn't true strength.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.458
It's merely power.

09:45.543 --> 09:49.088
I now believe true strength is found
in vulnerability...

09:49.755 --> 09:52.341
in forgiveness, in love.

09:53.342 --> 09:54.468
[boys laughing]

09:55.303 --> 09:58.681
[Harrow]  There is a beautiful
upside-down truth,

09:58.764 --> 10:02.184
which is that these moments
of purest strength

10:02.268 --> 10:05.021
appear as weakness
to those who don't know better.

10:06.105 --> 10:08.482
For a long time, I didn't know better.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.195
I ask you and your brother to reject
history as a narrative of strength,

10:14.322 --> 10:18.701
and instead have faith
that it can be a narrative of love.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.292
[Villads] So, Rayla...

10:26.375 --> 10:28.628
[chuckles] That's an unusual name,
isn't it?

10:29.253 --> 10:30.379
Oh! [laughs nervously]

10:30.463 --> 10:35.343
Yeah, uh, my human parents
had an unusual taste in names...

10:35.426 --> 10:37.345
Villads with a silent D.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.181
Hmm, 'tis fair. [chuckles]

10:40.765 --> 10:42.224
So, what do you do for a living?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.060
I'm an assassin.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.605
[laughing]

10:47.688 --> 10:49.857
Oh! You're not joking.

10:49.940 --> 10:52.401
Well, I'm supposed to be an assassin,

10:52.485 --> 10:55.529
but I've never actually,
you know, killed anyone.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.740
Oh. Well, maybe someday.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.784
Never give up on your dreams.

11:00.409 --> 11:01.869
Thanks for the encouragement.

11:02.370 --> 11:07.041
But the truth is, I'm not sure
being an assassin is my dream after all.

11:07.124 --> 11:10.628
Oh! So, then... what is your dream?

11:11.128 --> 11:12.922
Ugh, I wish I knew.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.262
[Viren]  With the heavy heart of the titan,

11:20.346 --> 11:23.015
and the additional burden
of carrying the wounded,

11:23.724 --> 11:27.478
our pace back to the Breach
was slower than I'd wished.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.148
Dawn came.

11:31.232 --> 11:33.526
As the sun rose on the horizon,

11:33.609 --> 11:35.319
I could feel its heat on my neck,

11:35.403 --> 11:39.115
like a hot doom I knew was coming for us.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.617
But we pushed forward,

11:41.700 --> 11:45.246
hoping to escape the inevitable
consequence of our trespass.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.666
There's the entrance.

11:49.417 --> 11:50.543
We've almost made it!

11:51.168 --> 11:54.338
-Faster! All our strength now!
-[horses neighing]

11:55.256 --> 11:58.217
[Viren]  Suddenly, the heat disappeared.

11:59.885 --> 12:03.556
There was a chill
as a shadow covered the sun.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.350
But instead of relief,

12:07.268 --> 12:09.937
I felt a cold dread.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.148
[thunder rumbling]

12:14.233 --> 12:15.109
[Harrow] Thunder.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.278
[horse whinnies]

12:17.361 --> 12:19.238
[Viren]  The storm had come.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.450
[screeching]

12:22.533 --> 12:24.952
[laughing]

12:25.619 --> 12:26.620
[gags]

12:29.331 --> 12:33.878
I'm a crazy old man,
but let me share some wisdom, will ya?

12:34.462 --> 12:37.756
[sighs] Why not? I love wisdom. Bring it.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.886
Life is like a river.

12:41.969 --> 12:45.848
Ugh! Oh, great.
That's exactly what I was afraid of.

12:45.931 --> 12:46.849
[laughing]

12:47.558 --> 12:49.602
You can't see too far ahead.

12:49.685 --> 12:52.771
I can't see at all,
as I might have mentioned before.

12:52.855 --> 12:54.273
You mentioned!

12:54.356 --> 12:57.943
You don't know where the river of life
will bend and turn.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.488
You don't know where it will go at all.

13:00.571 --> 13:02.656
How is that supposed to be helpful?

13:03.282 --> 13:06.410
Don't try to control where the river goes.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.163
There's one thing
you can know and control,

13:09.663 --> 13:10.873
yourself.

13:11.582 --> 13:15.753
Look at yourself. Who are you, Rayla?
What do you stand for?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.882
Once you know that,
then wherever the river takes you,

13:19.965 --> 13:23.135
you'll be right where
you were always meant to be.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
Villads, that's amazing.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.933
When you started talking,

13:29.016 --> 13:32.102
I was sure you were going to spout
some complete nonsense,

13:32.186 --> 13:35.189
but what you said, it's beautiful.

13:35.272 --> 13:37.316
[Villads snoring]

13:39.401 --> 13:41.820
[Berto squawks] I'll tell him later.

13:45.991 --> 13:48.244
[roaring]

13:48.869 --> 13:50.329
We'll never make it.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.334
We have to hold off the dragon
as long as possible

13:55.417 --> 13:57.795
so those carrying the heart
can make it back.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.004
Stop!

13:59.088 --> 14:01.757
This is our day to sacrifice.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.759
You get the titan's heart to safety.

14:03.842 --> 14:05.719
Save all our people.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.267
Come on.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.811
[roaring]

14:22.820 --> 14:23.654
[yelling]

14:36.834 --> 14:37.710
I can help!

14:42.673 --> 14:44.091
[roaring]

14:49.346 --> 14:50.556
[roars]

14:52.016 --> 14:54.393
Aspiro frigis!

14:55.728 --> 14:57.187
[roaring]

15:04.570 --> 15:05.738
For Aanya!

15:22.129 --> 15:23.297
[both screaming]

15:29.011 --> 15:32.056
They've bought us enough time.
We've made it!

15:32.139 --> 15:33.515
[horse neighing]

15:34.975 --> 15:36.685
-What is it?
-Viren...

15:37.645 --> 15:41.023
Without him to perform the spell,
the heart is worthless,

15:41.106 --> 15:42.650
and this was all for nothing.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.444
Sarai, what are you saying?

15:47.071 --> 15:48.739
I'll see you on the other side.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.040
[Harrow]  The last time I saw your mother,

15:58.123 --> 16:01.168
she said, "I will see you
on the other side."

16:02.086 --> 16:04.213
I don't know what lies on the other side.

16:04.713 --> 16:09.385
But I do know I will be watching over
you and your brother always.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.471
[Thunder roaring]

16:26.068 --> 16:27.236
[roaring]

16:29.279 --> 16:30.155
[grunts]

16:31.031 --> 16:33.492
-Thank you.
-[grunts] Don't thank me yet.

16:33.575 --> 16:35.077
[roaring]

16:54.847 --> 16:55.931
Yah! Yah!

17:09.361 --> 17:10.446
[coughing]

17:12.197 --> 17:13.032
[gasps]

17:16.410 --> 17:18.454
Come on. We have to run.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.587
[gasping weakly]

17:28.881 --> 17:31.258
[Viren]  I was there when Queen Sarai

17:32.801 --> 17:34.386
took her last breath.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.263
[Sarai exhales heavily]

17:37.181 --> 17:38.015
[Sarai groans]

17:39.058 --> 17:40.309
[Viren]  We returned home.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.605
Xadia had stolen
precious loved ones from us.

17:44.688 --> 17:47.941
Their loss changed our lives forever...

17:50.694 --> 17:53.238
but their sacrifice changed the world.

17:59.953 --> 18:03.957
The heart of the titan
yielded its incredible life force.

18:07.086 --> 18:08.837
The spell worked.

18:09.671 --> 18:12.341
It created fertility and abundance.

18:13.008 --> 18:16.011
A hundred thousand lives were saved.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.931
Families celebrated their life and health.

18:19.473 --> 18:22.601
They were safe, alive, together.

18:23.811 --> 18:27.648
The people of both of our kingdoms
knew who they owed their lives to.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.776
These incredible heroes.

18:31.401 --> 18:34.196
Three queens, three mothers...

18:35.239 --> 18:36.824
became legends.

18:50.462 --> 18:51.630
It should have been me.

18:52.339 --> 18:53.549
I'm so sorry.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.052
[female guard] Your Highness.
He's waiting for you now.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.847
[sighs] Okay.

19:07.062 --> 19:08.438
[male guard] Are you ready?

19:08.522 --> 19:11.316
No, but you may open the doors.

19:11.942 --> 19:12.901
[door opens]

19:20.450 --> 19:21.326
[sighs]

19:21.869 --> 19:24.621
Callum, I want to talk to you about life.

19:25.330 --> 19:26.707
And growing up.

19:26.790 --> 19:30.502
And how sometimes there are changes
you don't expect.

19:33.797 --> 19:34.631
[door closes]

19:37.342 --> 19:39.261
[Harrow]  I've tried to be
selfless as a king,

19:39.344 --> 19:42.973
but as a father, I have a selfish wish.

19:44.099 --> 19:46.059
And that is for you and Ezran to be...

19:46.685 --> 19:47.686
free.

19:48.812 --> 19:50.272
Reject the chains of history.

19:50.814 --> 19:53.692
Do not let the past
define your future, as I did.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.320
Free yourself from the past.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.699
Learn from it, understand it,
then let it go.

20:00.782 --> 20:05.120
Create a brighter future
from your own hearts and imagination.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.293
[Viren] I'm sorry you were never
able to know them.

20:12.461 --> 20:13.462
Your mothers.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.798
Thank you for sharing this story,
Lord Viren.

20:16.882 --> 20:20.177
I feel lucky to have heard
so many beautiful stories.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.137
This is how I've gotten to know them.

20:22.221 --> 20:26.058
They were very brave,
and very strong, and wise.

20:27.017 --> 20:28.810
I know it is not my place to say,

20:29.353 --> 20:31.980
but I am sure they would have been
very proud of you.

20:40.405 --> 20:43.200
It may seem strange to miss someone
I've never known,

20:43.825 --> 20:46.411
but I miss them so much.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.790
Queen Aanya, knowing what you know now,

20:49.873 --> 20:53.293
can you see why I believe
that if your mothers were here today,

20:54.086 --> 20:57.506
they would choose to join us
and fight by our side?

20:58.632 --> 20:59.758
I think you are right.

21:00.425 --> 21:01.385
Perhaps they would.

21:03.762 --> 21:06.014
But I... will not.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.057
What?

21:08.100 --> 21:11.561
We owe Katolis a great debt,
there is no doubt.

21:12.271 --> 21:16.608
We received so much kindness
and courage and sacrifice.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.903
But I cannot repay a debt
of a hundred thousand

21:19.987 --> 21:21.571
whose lives were saved

21:22.281 --> 21:25.826
by sending a million men
and women to die in violence.

21:25.909 --> 21:28.245
Did you not listen? Did you not...

21:29.413 --> 21:30.247
King Ahling!

21:31.123 --> 21:33.125
Help me talk some sense into her.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.546
Viren, we sympathize
with the plight of Katolis,

21:37.629 --> 21:40.632
but I'm afraid we can no longer--

21:40.716 --> 21:41.717
Coward!

21:42.968 --> 21:44.177
Traitors.

21:44.261 --> 21:50.851
Each of you standing here today,
you betray humanity!

21:50.934 --> 21:53.687
Lord Viren, I'm sorry.

21:55.439 --> 21:58.442
Save your empty apology.

21:59.693 --> 22:01.194
There is danger coming.

22:01.278 --> 22:03.405
They'll be on your side
of the border soon.

22:03.488 --> 22:07.242
You'll all pay the price
for ignoring my warnings.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.041
[Harrow]  And, finally,
you must be wondering

22:14.124 --> 22:16.168
about the secret I promised to share.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.545
Well, good news.

22:18.628 --> 22:20.839
The secret is hidden
in the Banther Lodge,

22:20.922 --> 22:22.841
right where you are right now.

22:22.924 --> 22:24.468
How's that for planning?

22:24.551 --> 22:27.095
Huh. Good thing we're at
the Banther Lodge, huh, Bait?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.388
[croaks]

22:28.472 --> 22:31.266
[Harrow]  Right now, go upstairs
to the game room.

22:31.349 --> 22:35.020
There, I have hidden an unusual cube
with rune symbols on each side.

22:35.103 --> 22:35.937
[exclaims]

22:40.484 --> 22:42.402
[Harrow]  This cube is an ancient relic

22:42.486 --> 22:44.696
that has been passed down
through the ages.

22:44.780 --> 22:49.326
It belonged to an elven wizard in Xadia,
the Archmage Aaravos,

22:49.409 --> 22:52.037
a master of all six primal sources.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.123
It is hidden in a box of keys

22:55.207 --> 22:57.667
because it is known
as the "Key of Aaravos,"

22:58.210 --> 23:02.047
and legends say it unlocks something
of great power in Xadia.

23:02.798 --> 23:06.635
Perhaps it will be you, Callum,
who discovers the key's secrets.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.096
[croaks]

23:09.179 --> 23:12.349
[Harrow]  And one last
extra-super-secret bonus secret.

23:13.058 --> 23:16.061
Did you know that Bait,
our most sour friend,

23:16.144 --> 23:18.063
secretly loves belly rubs?

23:20.357 --> 23:21.566
[snorting]

23:22.192 --> 23:25.612
-Aww! Who's a tubby lumpa grump?
-[purring]

23:29.407 --> 23:32.160
You probably thought
I was just a crazy old sea captain,

23:32.244 --> 23:33.745
but I've got some good wisdom.

23:33.829 --> 23:37.082
I'll admit it.
You do have some good wisdom.

23:37.749 --> 23:40.377
You want to know the other secret to life?

23:41.503 --> 23:42.921
Waterproof socks!

23:43.004 --> 23:44.381
It's a metaphor.

23:44.464 --> 23:45.549
Think about it.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.718
You just showed me the socks.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.595
That's not what a metaphor is.

23:58.687 --> 23:59.938
[both yawning]

24:02.315 --> 24:03.150
[yelps]

24:04.651 --> 24:06.153
What's that for?

24:06.778 --> 24:09.322
You're my brother,
and you mean everything to me.

24:09.406 --> 24:10.615
Is this a trick?

24:10.699 --> 24:13.076
[chuckles] No. I just love you.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.245
-Well, I love you, too.
-[yips]

24:15.954 --> 24:18.415
So are we there yet? Are we close?

24:18.498 --> 24:21.042
[sniffs] We are close.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.296
-I smell land!
-[caws]

24:32.179 --> 24:34.598
Hey, what was that? A shadow?

24:34.681 --> 24:36.850
Eh, you're asking the wrong pirate.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.269
[Rayla] There's something up there.
