WEBVTT

00:09.500 --> 00:11.583
Keep it steady.

00:11.667 --> 00:14.583
'Don't think.
Just trust your hands.'

00:17.041 --> 00:18.917
'There you go.'

00:20.125 --> 00:21.083
'That's it.'

00:21.166 --> 00:22.500
That's a decent Adams.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.417
See if you catch
any fish with it first

00:26.500 --> 00:29.667
before you go
celebrating too much.

00:29.750 --> 00:33.291
I mean, that's
the problem in life. Pride.

00:33.375 --> 00:36.667
People think
they can't help
it.

00:36.750 --> 00:37.709
But man has a choice.

00:37.792 --> 00:38.792
And that's where he's different

00:38.875 --> 00:40.041
from an animal.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.625
That's right.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.834
It's from "East Of Eden."

00:43.917 --> 00:45.875
Only showed it 20 times.

00:45.959 --> 00:47.375
Yeah.

00:47.458 --> 00:49.959
At the drive-in.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.583
Well, I guess you're right,
but it doesn't make it

00:51.667 --> 00:53.667
any less true, take it from me.

00:53.750 --> 00:56.250
They got a "Dirty Harry"
double bill playing in town.

00:56.333 --> 00:58.417
Maybe we could go.

00:58.500 --> 00:59.875
Sure.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.250
'We'll see.'

01:01.750 --> 01:03.625
Hey.

01:03.709 --> 01:05.542
Why don't you go
grab us some firewood.

01:07.166 --> 01:08.417
'Paul.'

01:09.208 --> 01:10.834
You're a good kid.

01:30.333 --> 01:31.417
Dad?

01:46.458 --> 01:47.709
Dad?

01:53.875 --> 01:55.125
'Dad?'

02:05.750 --> 02:07.625
[Paul screams]
'Dad!'

02:12.750 --> 02:14.917
We have no sign of the shooter
from the post office

02:15.000 --> 02:18.000
but we found his van abandoned
at an old campground.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.875
Well, cause of death
looks like a single
bullet.

02:20.959 --> 02:23.875
Exit wound
through
the top of the
skull.

02:23.959 --> 02:26.208
- Suicide.
- Bill Shepard.

02:26.291 --> 02:28.959
Killed four people,
then himself back in 1983.

02:29.041 --> 02:31.709
We got a different take, John.

02:31.792 --> 02:33.083
Yates?

02:35.000 --> 02:36.542
You got me, G-man.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.083
You're suspended pending an OPR.

02:38.166 --> 02:39.542
That coming from you or HQ?

02:39.625 --> 02:40.750
Even if I wanted to protect you

02:40.834 --> 02:42.709
I couldn't once
those shots were fired.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.834
And you're about a hundred
miles out of your
jurisdiction.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.375
And you'd be about 500 miles

02:46.458 --> 02:47.792
away from this
cabin without her.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.417
No thanks to you
playing keep-away.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.959
Well, such a crack investigator

02:51.041 --> 02:53.083
figured you'd
find it on your
own.

02:53.166 --> 02:54.834
Always this
insubordinate, lieutenant?

02:54.917 --> 02:56.291
Not to me.
Can we get on with this?

02:56.375 --> 02:57.709
- Absolutely.
- Yates.

02:57.792 --> 03:00.041
Ryan, when you're done
putting 'em on the table

03:00.125 --> 03:02.125
come and see what we've got.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.250
So, ME estimates Bill Shepard

03:06.333 --> 03:08.041
offed himself
about 30 years ago.

03:08.125 --> 03:10.083
But all that time
someone's been paying

03:10.166 --> 03:12.792
property tax on this cabin
using a local checking
account.

03:12.875 --> 03:14.750
Even after Shepard died,
paid up every year.

03:14.834 --> 03:18.542
So, there's checks from
the late '70s, early '80s.

03:18.625 --> 03:19.959
Signatures are different.

03:20.041 --> 03:22.417
They changed somewhere
around the fall of 1978.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.792
From this to this.

03:25.709 --> 03:26.834
Bill Shepard dropped off

03:26.917 --> 03:28.583
the face of the Earth in 1978

03:28.667 --> 03:31.083
but our first
body
dropped in 1980.

03:31.166 --> 03:33.333
So, Shepard was dead
before the first murders?

03:33.417 --> 03:35.125
Means someone else
did the killing.

03:35.208 --> 03:39.250
Yeah. Bill's son, Paul Shepard.

03:39.333 --> 03:40.959
Yeah, the bag from
his video store.

03:41.041 --> 03:43.959
Half-empty box of
.25-06 cartridges.

03:44.041 --> 03:45.500
Same as our sniper's ammo.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.291
Paul claimed that
his father ran off

03:47.375 --> 03:48.834
but he's been coming up here.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.625
Makes him what, 16, when
the first murder occurred?

03:51.709 --> 03:53.041
Awful young for a serial killer.

03:53.125 --> 03:54.542
Old enough to pull a trigger.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.166
Scotty, tell me you
found Paul Shepard.

04:00.250 --> 04:03.834
No, but I sure as hell
know where he's been.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.500
(Scotty)
'Theodore Kutler.'

04:20.583 --> 04:22.333
'Twenty six-year-old
grad student.'

04:22.417 --> 04:23.667
Took a bullet coming out of his

04:23.750 --> 04:25.500
apartment couple hours ago.

04:25.583 --> 04:26.667
Witnesses?

04:26.750 --> 04:28.250
Well, several people
heard the shot and..

04:28.333 --> 04:31.917
...one witness saw a
muzzle
flash from that building.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.667
There was a shell
casing found on the
roof.

04:34.750 --> 04:35.709
Getting sloppy.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.500
He's on a spree.

04:37.583 --> 04:39.208
I'll take that.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.333
Last I heard, Ninth and Cherry
was still Philadelphia proper.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.667
Well, if you want to get that
evidence processed this year

04:44.750 --> 04:46.917
'we're gonna have
to send it to my lab.'

04:47.000 --> 04:49.166
Unless, of course,
you don't trust me.

04:50.583 --> 04:53.500
Scotty, work the scene, huh?

04:53.583 --> 04:55.542
Not looking for
a jurisdiction
war.

04:55.625 --> 04:57.291
It's only a matter of time
before the media finds out

04:57.375 --> 04:59.709
we have an active
serial
killer on a rampage.

04:59.792 --> 05:01.041
Well, what do you propose?

05:01.125 --> 05:02.875
Joint task force.
Your guys and mine.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.875
Hey, look, no one's
up to speed like Rush.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.041
- She runs point on this.
- Fair enough.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.667
But we prosecute.

05:10.583 --> 05:11.500
Yates too.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.375
- It's her case.
- No deal.

05:13.458 --> 05:14.834
Yates has already
booked a one-way
ticket

05:14.917 --> 05:16.500
to the Anchorage field office.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.041
Cavanaugh. Change of plans.

05:19.125 --> 05:21.834
Rush and I have field
command with your oversight.

05:21.917 --> 05:23.208
According to who?

05:23.291 --> 05:24.291
Well, you, actually.

05:24.375 --> 05:26.375
Just got off
the phone with the SAC.

05:26.458 --> 05:28.125
Let him know your
plans to pursue the case

05:28.208 --> 05:29.375
and he signed off.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.125
Even you don't
have
the balls, Yates.

05:31.208 --> 05:34.959
Well, call him yourself,
Ryan, if you don't believe me.

05:35.041 --> 05:36.792
Of course you're gonna have
to explain how I went off

05:36.875 --> 05:39.917
the reservation for a week,
opened this case solo

05:40.000 --> 05:42.750
while you sat in your
corner office clueless.

05:46.750 --> 05:49.417
Don't pout, Ryan.
It causes frown lines.

05:52.959 --> 05:54.750
Bad news is she likes you.

05:54.834 --> 05:57.417
Or maybe she just
cares about the job.

05:57.500 --> 06:00.625
You've known her,
what, three days?

06:00.709 --> 06:03.875
Yates talks a good
game...
but she's reckless.

06:07.875 --> 06:10.917
Being told that before our
victim was a grad student

06:11.000 --> 06:14.583
he was the manager at
the Long View Video
Store.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.875
That was Paul Shepard's place.

06:18.333 --> 06:19.792
(Kat)
'Anything different
about Paul lately?'

06:19.875 --> 06:21.375
He seem aggravated, depressed?

06:21.458 --> 06:22.834
No. No more than usual.

06:22.917 --> 06:24.333
You-you guys need,
like, a warrant

06:24.417 --> 06:25.959
to be here?
'Cause I'm in charge.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.000
(Will)
'When was the last
time you saw Paul?'

06:28.083 --> 06:29.667
Uh, yesterday?

06:29.750 --> 06:31.291
No, no. Day before.

06:31.375 --> 06:35.792
Uh, no. Thursday.
It was, it was Thursday.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.625
What are you
doing on that thing?

06:38.709 --> 06:41.291
Oh, totally Tweeting all this.

06:44.834 --> 06:47.667
- Dude.
- Hey, Brian, focus.

06:47.750 --> 06:49.750
Tell us about your
relationship with Paul.

06:49.834 --> 06:53.291
Alright, uh, Theo was
the manager, Paul was the
owner.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.208
Little more detail. Like why
Theo didn't work here anymore.

06:56.291 --> 06:57.458
He quit? Get fired?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.959
Oh, oh, d-definitely fired.

07:06.083 --> 07:08.417
[sighs]
What the hell happened, Theo?

07:08.500 --> 07:11.875
- We were robbed.
- Yeah, I can see that.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.458
They wrecked the place.

07:15.959 --> 07:18.125
Windows aren't broken.

07:19.291 --> 07:21.208
The locks are untouched.

07:21.291 --> 07:23.834
The alarm didn't go off.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.125
You see where I'm
going with this, Theo?

07:27.291 --> 07:29.709
I was kind of out
of it last night.

07:29.792 --> 07:33.250
My girlfriend and I
were fighting, and..

07:33.333 --> 07:35.583
'...I went over there.'

07:35.667 --> 07:38.083
- 'Might have neglected to..'
- You might have neglected?

07:39.959 --> 07:43.417
Do you understand
what this means, Theo?

07:43.500 --> 07:46.125
The insurance won't pay
if the alarm wasn't on.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.041
Maybe I could chip in.

07:51.125 --> 07:54.041
It's-it's not just the money.

07:54.125 --> 07:57.166
I mean, look at this
stuff.
It's-it's-it's
irreplaceable.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.542
I mean, do you,
do you have any
idea

07:59.625 --> 08:03.166
how long it took
me
to fix this place
up?

08:03.250 --> 08:04.542
'Huh?'

08:10.375 --> 08:12.291
You know what?

08:12.375 --> 08:14.625
Just-just get
the hell out of here!

08:26.500 --> 08:28.583
Yeah, those repairs
cost, like, a ton.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.041
Paul had to close
the other stores

08:30.125 --> 08:31.750
just to make up the difference.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.542
You know, it's not like the
vid biz is a growth
industry.

08:34.625 --> 08:36.250
We're gonna need
access to your
safe.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.917
Any financials you have here.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.667
Alright, in the office.

08:39.750 --> 08:42.583
U-um, I-I got..

08:42.667 --> 08:43.917
...tardiness issues.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.792
You think Paul's
gunning for me too?

08:47.875 --> 08:50.417
You might want to
stop Tweeting about it.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.291
Where is your husband
right now, Mrs. Shepard?

08:58.375 --> 08:59.500
I don't know.

08:59.583 --> 09:01.041
When was the last
time you saw him?

09:01.125 --> 09:02.625
Uh, yesterday morning.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.208
Is that normal?

09:04.291 --> 09:06.125
'Disappearing for
a day and a half?'

09:06.208 --> 09:07.333
What's going on?

09:07.417 --> 09:09.333
We're just
looking
to talk to Paul.

09:09.417 --> 09:13.375
If it was just to talk,
then the FBI wouldn't be here.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.458
Well, that's
right,
Mrs. Shepard.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.083
The fact is, we
think your
husband

09:18.166 --> 09:21.125
may have been
involved in a
shooting.

09:21.208 --> 09:24.250
- He own a rifle you know of?
he

09:24.333 --> 09:26.500
Claire, I understand how
difficult this is for you

09:26.583 --> 09:29.125
'but Paul's out
there right now..'

09:29.208 --> 09:30.959
'...and no matter what
he did or didn't do'

09:31.041 --> 09:33.458
the best thing for everyone..

09:33.542 --> 09:36.250
...is to bring him back safely.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.000
He's, uh..

09:39.166 --> 09:41.500
...he's been under
a lot of pressure lately..

09:41.583 --> 09:43.083
...with the video stores.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.083
There a place that he goes
to when he's feeling
stressed

09:45.166 --> 09:47.834
or under pressure
other than the
cabin?

09:48.792 --> 09:50.041
What cabin?

09:50.125 --> 09:53.125
The cabin your husband
owns in Mount Pocono.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.458
Which is where we found this.

09:59.583 --> 10:01.875
That's Bill Shepard,
Paul's father.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.542
His father? Uh--

10:03.625 --> 10:05.709
He ever talk about him?

10:05.792 --> 10:07.667
Oh, my God.

10:07.750 --> 10:09.709
He ever tell you
how his father
died?

10:09.792 --> 10:11.542
No.

10:11.625 --> 10:13.333
I found out on my own.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.959
(Paul)
What the hell are you doing?

10:37.041 --> 10:40.250
I'm sorry. I, I was
just looking for
stamps.

10:43.625 --> 10:46.959
You told me your
father
walked out on you.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.375
This is a suicide note.

10:48.458 --> 10:51.208
What's the difference?

10:51.291 --> 10:53.917
Gone is gone.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.125
How did it happen?

10:57.208 --> 10:59.375
He shot himself.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.125
Nothing I could do.

11:01.208 --> 11:02.709
You?

11:04.125 --> 11:07.041
Paul...you were
the one who found him?

11:08.500 --> 11:11.083
You should have just asked
me for the damn stamps.

11:11.166 --> 11:12.500
I'm sorry.

11:13.542 --> 11:15.875
That must have been so hard.

11:16.959 --> 11:18.667
It's something I
will never do to you.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.500
You understand me?

11:20.583 --> 11:23.417
I will never leave you.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.542
Or the family we're making.

11:26.917 --> 11:29.000
Well, what if we
can't make a
family?

11:31.542 --> 11:33.000
We've been
trying
for two years.

11:33.083 --> 11:34.542
Then we keep trying.

11:34.625 --> 11:38.041
- It's so expensive.
- Oh, come on.

11:38.125 --> 11:40.458
You let me worry
about that, okay?

11:50.625 --> 11:53.625
He never liked to
talk about his family.

11:53.709 --> 11:56.583
That part of him
was...closed off.

12:01.291 --> 12:04.542
You really have no idea
who your husband is, do
you?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.917
(Lilly)
'"I can't do this anymore.'

12:08.000 --> 12:08.959
'"I am nothing.'

12:09.041 --> 12:10.458
"Less than nothing.

12:10.542 --> 12:12.125
"This world is full
of people willing

12:12.208 --> 12:14.458
"to kick you when you're
down, like the secretary

12:14.542 --> 12:18.291
"too blind to realize
she works for thieves.

12:18.375 --> 12:22.083
"Like the repo men, devoid
of common human decency.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.208
'"Like the judgmental
bus driver'

12:26.291 --> 12:28.500
"who offered nothing but pity.

12:30.375 --> 12:33.166
"And finally, to my son Paul..

12:33.250 --> 12:35.834
"...I'm sorry, but I'm too
weak to take you with me.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.542
'"I tried to make
something special'

12:37.625 --> 12:41.166
but nobody seems to
care.
Nobody ever will."

12:41.250 --> 12:44.166
Suicide note written
by Bill Shepard in 1978.

12:44.250 --> 12:46.333
We believe his son
Paul used this note

12:46.417 --> 12:48.834
as a blueprint for revenge.

12:48.917 --> 12:53.000
Barry Jensen, Felicity Andrews,
Preston Schmall, Fred Norris..

12:53.083 --> 12:55.667
...killed between 1980 and '83.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.625
Mel Shaver,
Walt Granville, Theo Kutler

12:58.709 --> 13:00.792
cut down within
the last five months.

13:00.875 --> 13:02.291
He's not haphazard.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.875
Not in it for the thrill.
Shepard has an objective.

13:04.959 --> 13:06.333
'There was a pattern
to his first killings.'

13:06.417 --> 13:07.959
Well, figure out
the pattern today

13:08.041 --> 13:10.542
maybe we catch him
before he kills again.

13:10.625 --> 13:13.291
We were able to remotely
clone Paul Shepard's cell
phone.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.709
Anything he hears
or says, we pick it up.

13:15.792 --> 13:17.041
Got this five minutes ago.

13:17.125 --> 13:18.542
(Paul on speaker)
'Hey, it's Paul.'

13:18.625 --> 13:20.625
'I was, uh, hoping,
you guys were around.'

13:20.709 --> 13:22.041
'I wanted to drop by.'

13:22.125 --> 13:23.709
<i>lasagna</i>
night, right?'

13:23.792 --> 13:25.959
[sighs]
'A-anyway, I-I'll
try again later.'

13:26.041 --> 13:27.542
Number belongs to
Charles and Rita
Gleason

13:27.625 --> 13:28.792
of Morristown, New Jersey.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.208
Shepard's aunt
and uncle raised him

13:30.291 --> 13:31.542
after his father died.

13:31.625 --> 13:32.875
(Ryan)
Turned his phone off after
that.

13:32.959 --> 13:35.125
But we were able
to pick up a GPS signal.

13:36.834 --> 13:39.667
'Right outside
the Gleasons' house.'

13:39.750 --> 13:41.500
There's no sign of Paul Shepard.

13:41.583 --> 13:43.208
Aunt and uncle
were at a
neighbor's.

13:43.291 --> 13:44.917
Came back, their
car was missing.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.667
He took their car?

13:46.750 --> 13:48.250
So, how'd he get here?

13:58.583 --> 13:59.917
We're clear.

14:13.208 --> 14:14.583
(John)
'What do you got?'

14:14.667 --> 14:17.667
ID on that dead
truck
driver. Ned Cotner.

14:17.750 --> 14:19.458
Reported missing last night.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.834
Up near Paul Shepard's cabin.

14:21.917 --> 14:23.291
(John)
'Shepard must
have carjacked him.'

14:23.375 --> 14:24.875
Left the truck
and the body at
his

14:24.959 --> 14:26.667
aunt and uncle's
place,
took their car.

14:26.750 --> 14:29.667
We may have a line
on the next victim.

14:29.750 --> 14:33.291
Now, most of Paul
Shepard's
original victims

14:33.375 --> 14:35.500
were mentioned in his
father's suicide note.

14:35.583 --> 14:37.875
Bill Shepard killed
himself when he was 45.

14:37.959 --> 14:41.208
Paul Shepard turned 45
in October last year.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.125
Well, children of
suicides dread reaching

14:43.208 --> 14:44.709
the age of their parent's death.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.083
Paul got revenge
on the people he

14:46.166 --> 14:47.375
blamed for his father's failure.

14:47.458 --> 14:48.583
Well, now, he's getting
revenge on the people

14:48.667 --> 14:49.792
he blames for his own.

14:49.875 --> 14:52.625
Felicity
Andrews,
killed in 1981.

14:52.709 --> 14:54.834
'She neglected to
file loan paperwork.'

14:54.917 --> 14:56.583
Bill Shepard
blamed her for losing

14:56.667 --> 14:58.083
his drive-in when he defaulted.

14:58.166 --> 15:00.917
Theo Kutler forgot to lock up

15:01.000 --> 15:03.458
Paul's video store,
resulting in a break-in.

15:03.542 --> 15:05.333
The loss crippled his business.

15:05.417 --> 15:08.333
Then there's Preston
Schmall
repo man, shot in '82.

15:08.417 --> 15:11.000
Took his dad's car,
disabling
his ability to go to work.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.875
According to witnesses,
Paul's father begged Schmall

15:13.959 --> 15:15.375
to give him another week.

15:15.458 --> 15:17.291
Even suggesting they
shared a brotherhood..

15:17.375 --> 15:18.875
'...both former marines.'

15:18.959 --> 15:21.166
Been looking through
Paul's
correspondence.

15:21.250 --> 15:24.959
Found a dozen letters from
his accountant, Kenneth
Hoag.

15:25.041 --> 15:27.500
"Paul, you have to face
facts.
The IRS will not go away.

15:27.583 --> 15:30.625
I won't be able to stop
them from taking your store."

15:30.709 --> 15:33.792
You think this accountant
is a matchup for the repo man?

15:33.875 --> 15:35.625
Guy's not just
Paul's
accountant.

15:35.709 --> 15:37.166
They went to college together.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.834
Fraternity brothers.

15:38.917 --> 15:42.542
Well, let's pick him up
before Paul picks him off.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.333
Is Paul in some kind of danger?

15:45.417 --> 15:47.000
He may be, Mrs. Gleason.

15:47.083 --> 15:48.500
That's why we need your help.

15:48.583 --> 15:50.291
Any idea why he came here?

15:50.375 --> 15:51.291
H-he's my nephew.

15:51.375 --> 15:52.917
I practically raised him.

15:53.000 --> 15:54.083
He doesn't need a reason.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.875
When's the last
time you saw him?

15:55.959 --> 15:57.291
Uh, not since Thanksgiving.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.667
Did something happen
on Thanksgiving?

15:59.750 --> 16:03.041
What does that have to do
with a dead body out there?

16:03.125 --> 16:04.709
Just trying to find your nephew.

16:04.792 --> 16:06.750
Well, nothing happened
at Thanksgiving.

16:06.834 --> 16:09.875
Obviously, I-I-I don't
know where Paul is.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.542
Clearly, you don't either.

16:11.625 --> 16:14.500
Has Paul had any
trouble recently?

16:14.583 --> 16:16.875
Paul doesn't get in trouble.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.041
Don't you find it
strange
that he took your car

16:19.125 --> 16:21.041
and he left a truck
with a corpse in it?

16:21.125 --> 16:22.834
You're suggesting he had

16:22.917 --> 16:24.959
something to do
with the dead body?

16:25.041 --> 16:26.875
Yup, that's what I'm suggesting.

16:26.959 --> 16:28.458
That's ridiculous.

16:28.542 --> 16:30.500
You said that you
practically raised him.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.166
How did he end up living here?

16:33.250 --> 16:37.542
Oh, my sister Martha
died
when he was very young.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.542
And then his father left.

16:39.625 --> 16:43.750
We were all he
had.
Poor boy.

16:43.834 --> 16:46.875
You don't know what he was
like when he first came here.

16:49.625 --> 16:50.709
(Rita)
'Paul.'

16:51.583 --> 16:52.667
Paul.

16:54.792 --> 16:57.000
Darling, are you alright?

16:57.083 --> 16:59.000
It's "East Of
Eden,"
Aunt Rita.

17:01.000 --> 17:03.250
James Dean, Raymond Massey.

17:03.333 --> 17:04.792
Directed by Elia Kazan.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.041
[chuckles]
You've seen it before?

17:07.125 --> 17:08.959
Dozens of times.

17:09.041 --> 17:11.583
My dad showed it every year.

17:11.667 --> 17:13.750
That's nice, dear,
but you're not eating.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.458
You must be hungry.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.792
You don't have to
wait to be served.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.750
You're family.
One of us, okay?

17:29.375 --> 17:31.959
He was so forlorn.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.458
A glass half-empty kind
of kid for a long time.

17:35.542 --> 17:37.917
- But he adapted?
- He was a good student.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.667
Got a job after school,
volunteered at the church.

17:40.750 --> 17:42.458
And you weren't
curious where he'd

17:42.542 --> 17:44.208
disappear to all
those weekends?

17:44.291 --> 17:45.792
He went camping a lot.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.166
No. No, not camping.

17:48.250 --> 17:50.458
No, see, while you were
here baking pies, Aunt
Rita

17:50.542 --> 17:52.750
he was out there
dropping bodies.

17:55.000 --> 17:58.333
- Yates, Yates--
- You think Paul killed
someone?

17:58.417 --> 18:00.291
Ma'am, we just
want to talk to him.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.458
- 'So, if you could tell us--'
- H-he couldn't even hurt a
fly.

18:03.542 --> 18:07.125
Felicity Andrews.
Preston Schmall, Fred
Norris.

18:07.208 --> 18:10.000
'Barry Jensen, and that's
just on your watch.'

18:10.083 --> 18:11.959
- It's a lie.
- No, it's not a lie.

18:12.041 --> 18:14.125
'You look at Barry.
You see that blood?'

18:14.208 --> 18:16.250
Now you tell me
who's
living the lie,
sister.

18:16.333 --> 18:17.500
Yates.

18:21.041 --> 18:22.417
Mr. Hoag, I'm
Lieutenant Stillman.

18:22.500 --> 18:25.083
We need to talk
about Paul Shepard.

18:25.166 --> 18:27.333
Yeah, I'll tell you
what
I told your
detective.

18:27.417 --> 18:28.542
I don't discuss my clients.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.125
I understand,
but this is urgent.

18:30.208 --> 18:32.542
I don't care if it's
a matter of national
security.

18:32.625 --> 18:34.125
I won't talk without my lawyer.

18:34.208 --> 18:36.834
And don't try to scare
me with some federal
BS.

18:36.917 --> 18:38.834
'I eat the IRS for breakfast.'

18:38.917 --> 18:42.917
Sir, we believe Paul Shepard
is a serial killer

18:43.000 --> 18:45.166
'and you're his next target.'

18:45.250 --> 18:48.834
But if you want to take your
chances out there, be my
guest.

18:54.291 --> 18:57.291
Must have been hard...
having Paul move in with
you.

18:57.375 --> 19:00.041
This 14-year-old stranger
comes to your house.

19:00.125 --> 19:01.500
You got your own
son to consider.

19:01.583 --> 19:02.875
Oh, we made do.

19:02.959 --> 19:05.333
Smooth sailing
from the word go?

19:05.417 --> 19:08.875
Well, between you and me,
the kid was always half queer.

19:08.959 --> 19:11.875
Rita's blood...not mine.

19:11.959 --> 19:14.583
- Queer how?
- Huh, never into sports.

19:14.667 --> 19:19.250
Not a lot of friends. He'd, uh,
sit and watch movies on the TV.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.834
Disappear for days.

19:20.917 --> 19:21.917
Sounds sketchy.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.083
Well, he outgrew it, though.

19:23.166 --> 19:24.375
He, uh..

19:24.458 --> 19:26.625
...turned his obsession
with movies into a living.

19:26.709 --> 19:30.083
And he always looked
out for my son Tom.

19:30.166 --> 19:33.041
They were
tight...
for a long time.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.291
were

19:34.375 --> 19:37.083
Always said you don't
do business with
family.

19:39.583 --> 19:42.208
I've had some
setbacks, Tom.

19:42.291 --> 19:43.875
Cash flow.
You know how it
is.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.959
You said that last
month, month before.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.250
So, I want to
know when, Paul.

19:48.333 --> 19:49.417
Shh.

19:50.625 --> 19:53.917
I have partners,
and they won't wait anymore.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.583
So, what?

19:55.667 --> 19:57.875
You're gonna kick me out?

19:57.959 --> 19:59.375
It's me, Tom.

19:59.458 --> 20:02.250
I used to baby-sit you, take
you to the movies. We're
family.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.166
I-I got my own family
to consider, Paul.

20:08.542 --> 20:10.834
Rosie's pregnant.

20:10.917 --> 20:12.417
Oh.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.834
Again?

20:15.625 --> 20:17.083
Hey.

20:17.166 --> 20:19.750
It's good news, right?

20:19.834 --> 20:21.583
Yeah. Uh, of course.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.166
I'm sorry. Congratulations.

20:25.291 --> 20:27.458
'I'll, um..'

20:27.542 --> 20:29.458
...I'll find
another
way out of this.

20:29.542 --> 20:32.792
I'm sorry, Paul.
Yeah. I know you will.

20:34.208 --> 20:37.083
You still own that
first store of yours.

20:37.166 --> 20:39.250
Got to be worth something.

20:45.875 --> 20:47.333
I don't know
what hurt him
worse.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.166
Losing the stores or..

20:49.250 --> 20:51.709
...finding out Tom
was having another
kid.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.875
You know where your son is now?

20:54.959 --> 20:58.500
Oh, he was supposed to come by
this afternoon, Sunday dinner.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.041
Uh, he should be here now.

21:01.125 --> 21:02.000
Excuse us.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.500
(Ryan)
'Thank you.'

21:07.458 --> 21:08.500
(Kat)
'Tom Gleason.'

21:08.583 --> 21:09.667
'Philadelphia Police.'

21:10.792 --> 21:12.333
'We're coming in, Mr. Gleason.'

21:35.000 --> 21:36.417
We're going to have to go.

21:36.500 --> 21:37.875
Well, is that about Paul?

21:37.959 --> 21:39.041
'Did you find him?'

21:39.125 --> 21:40.959
We'll be in touch.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.041
You'll look out for him, right?

21:47.125 --> 21:49.041
I don't want to
see him get
hurt.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.041
Yeah, we'll take care of him..

21:51.125 --> 21:52.417
...just like he
took care of Barry

21:52.500 --> 21:55.041
just like he took
care of your son too.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.041
Tom?

21:57.125 --> 21:59.125
What do you mean?
What happened?

21:59.208 --> 22:02.041
Sweet Paul just put
a bullet between his eyes.

22:04.458 --> 22:05.625
[crying]
No.

22:06.875 --> 22:08.625
What the hell
was that about?

22:09.625 --> 22:12.500
- Oh..
- You'll be alright.

22:12.583 --> 22:14.667
- Come on. Let's go inside.
- Come on.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.041
Who's Barry?

22:19.125 --> 22:21.792
- One of our victims.
- No.

22:21.875 --> 22:23.375
He's more than that.

22:23.458 --> 22:25.083
Oh, you're so freaking smart?

22:25.166 --> 22:26.792
Well, you call him Barry.

22:26.875 --> 22:29.208
All the others you
call by their last names.

22:29.291 --> 22:32.625
You keep calling him Barry.
Like you know him.

22:32.709 --> 22:34.208
I don't need to explain myself.

22:34.291 --> 22:36.083
Yeah, well, I'm
done unless you
do.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.625
I'm not going down
on your sinking
ship

22:37.709 --> 22:39.375
till you tell me
what's going on.

22:39.458 --> 22:41.208
Look, I was there.

22:50.166 --> 22:52.625
I was 18 years old.

22:52.709 --> 22:54.834
His body just
fell into my lap.

22:57.625 --> 22:59.625
Oh, my God! Ah!

23:00.709 --> 23:03.291
One day you're a kid
at the movies and..

23:04.542 --> 23:06.125
And then you're not.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.333
It still keeps me up at night.

23:11.083 --> 23:12.125
I mean, why?

23:12.208 --> 23:13.625
- Why Barry?
- Well, why not me?

23:13.709 --> 23:16.125
Why not anybody
else there that night?

23:18.667 --> 23:21.125
And now he's killing again.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.875
And I am so close.

23:26.125 --> 23:28.792
I'm going to find out
why he murdered Barry..

23:30.959 --> 23:33.250
...and then I'm gonna
put a bullet in him.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.959
(Scotty)
'Paul Shepard's out there,
okay'

23:44.041 --> 23:45.625
'with a high-powered rifle'

23:45.709 --> 23:47.417
waiting for us to release you.

23:47.500 --> 23:50.333
Hoag's either too stupid to
talk or he's hiding something.

23:50.417 --> 23:52.750
(Scotty)
'Now, you won't cooperate,
we can't keep you.'

23:52.834 --> 23:55.125
He's a dead man walking,
don't even know it.

23:55.208 --> 23:59.125
If I'm so important, you
won't let me out of your
sight.

23:59.208 --> 24:00.834
So, why protect him?

24:00.917 --> 24:05.667
Huh, some...fraternal code,
secret handshake crap?

24:05.750 --> 24:07.417
I'm just going to
wait for my
attorney

24:07.500 --> 24:09.333
if it's all the same with you.

24:09.417 --> 24:12.333
Well, it's your funeral, pal.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.458
Come on. Let's go.

24:13.542 --> 24:15.583
Sit down, Kenneth.

24:15.667 --> 24:17.333
Ryan Cavanaugh, FBI.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.834
I understand you're
reluctant to cooperate.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.750
Protecting your client.

24:21.834 --> 24:23.542
I respect that, but I'm not here

24:23.625 --> 24:25.834
to talk about Paul Shepard.

24:25.917 --> 24:28.667
I'm here to talk about you.

24:28.750 --> 24:30.875
I know everything
about you, Kenneth.

24:30.959 --> 24:34.417
Took me no more than an hour
to download your entire life.

24:34.500 --> 24:35.417
You don't scare me.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.083
'Those Web sites you frequent?'

24:37.166 --> 24:39.041
You're one sick pup, Kenny.

24:39.125 --> 24:42.041
And then there's the hooker
in Atlantic City five years
ago.

24:42.125 --> 24:43.792
'Used your company credit card.'

24:43.875 --> 24:46.709
Not to mention the inside
trading in the '90s.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.542
- That's illegal.
- 'Maybe.'

24:49.625 --> 24:52.375
But when your wife
and your clients find out..

24:52.458 --> 24:55.250
...who's really going to care?

24:55.333 --> 24:57.542
(Scotty)
Tell us about
Paul Shepard and we'll..

24:57.625 --> 24:59.375
...keep this to ourselves.

24:59.458 --> 25:00.750
Absolutely.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.375
We went to school together

25:03.458 --> 25:06.792
like, a hundred years ago, okay?

25:06.875 --> 25:08.417
I've been trying to
dig him out of a hole.

25:08.500 --> 25:11.375
He'd been hemorrhaging cash,
he didn't file his tax
returns.

25:11.458 --> 25:12.750
Problems with the IRS?

25:12.834 --> 25:14.041
I told him declare bankruptcy

25:14.125 --> 25:15.542
but he said he was
starting a family

25:15.625 --> 25:17.458
and he didn't want
to lose his house.

25:17.542 --> 25:19.250
So, you tried
to help him out.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.250
I felt bad for the guy.

25:21.333 --> 25:23.250
Hooked him up with
an associate of mine..

25:23.333 --> 25:26.000
...someone interested
in buying the store.

25:26.083 --> 25:27.375
A guy named Mel Shaver.

25:29.291 --> 25:33.583
You know, when I was a kid,
movies were everything.

25:33.667 --> 25:37.750
More than entertainment.
They were...like an escape.

25:37.834 --> 25:41.959
I wanted to share that
vision,
and that's The Long View.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.834
For 15 years we've
been the premier

25:43.917 --> 25:45.542
video store in Philadelphia.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.917
I'd like to think that we're

25:47.000 --> 25:49.125
more than just a business.

25:49.208 --> 25:52.208
We're a beacon for
the community, a refuge.

25:52.291 --> 25:54.792
I can see it's working great.

25:54.875 --> 25:57.417
Yeah, it's been a rough year.

25:57.500 --> 25:59.208
But we've seen
tough times before.

25:59.291 --> 26:01.041
We've always bounced back.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.625
People love movies.

26:02.709 --> 26:04.291
There's nothing you
offer I can't get
better

26:04.375 --> 26:06.125
and cheaper on the Web.

26:06.208 --> 26:08.834
Bottom line, I want the space

26:08.917 --> 26:11.792
and I'll take the inventory
and sell it off.

26:11.875 --> 26:15.125
You know, you're wrong
about my business.

26:15.208 --> 26:18.125
People want
face-to-face interaction.

26:18.208 --> 26:19.667
They appreciate what we do.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.125
Paul, you seem like a nice
guy, but let's be honest.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.959
Nobody cares about that crap.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.291
Not anymore.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.959
Now, he said, "Nobody cares?"

26:38.041 --> 26:39.291
(Kenneth)
'Yeah.'

26:39.375 --> 26:42.000
I thought it was kind of harsh.

26:42.083 --> 26:43.792
You don't hit
a guy when he's down.

26:43.875 --> 26:45.709
That's the same
words
Bill Shepard's

26:45.792 --> 26:47.834
suicide note ended with.

26:47.917 --> 26:50.875
Why he shot Mel Shaver.
Echoing Paul's father.

26:50.959 --> 26:52.625
Paul ever talk to Shaver again?

26:52.709 --> 26:54.375
Why don't you ask Shaver?

26:54.458 --> 26:56.667
Well, he's a little
dead right now.

26:57.750 --> 27:01.000
- Yeah.
- Paul needed to sell.

27:01.083 --> 27:03.667
He didn't have a choice.
Bled the business dry.

27:03.750 --> 27:06.000
'He was writing checks
20 grand at a time.'

27:06.083 --> 27:07.792
Company called LifeSpring.

27:07.875 --> 27:09.166
You know what that was?

27:09.250 --> 27:10.625
Fertility clinic.

27:10.709 --> 27:11.875
'He couldn't afford
the treatments.'

27:11.959 --> 27:13.542
'So, he used company money.'

27:13.625 --> 27:15.125
Look, Paul was ducking me

27:15.208 --> 27:16.875
when it got bad, okay?

27:16.959 --> 27:18.875
I had to track him down
at this coffee place.

27:18.959 --> 27:20.542
He would sit there all
day at this computer.

27:20.625 --> 27:23.458
- Coffee joint got a name?
- Alfonso's.

27:23.542 --> 27:26.250
'It's just up the block
from his video store.'

27:27.417 --> 27:28.917
He..

27:29.000 --> 27:32.375
Manager says Paul was
a fixture at Alfonso's.

27:32.458 --> 27:34.041
He was there this morning.

27:34.125 --> 27:36.542
A public computer, a perfect
place to profile his victims.

27:36.625 --> 27:38.417
Alright, let's see what we got.

27:38.500 --> 27:40.250
Looks like he
cleared the
browser.

27:40.333 --> 27:43.041
(Ryan)
'Cleared, maybe. Erased, no.'

27:43.125 --> 27:48.041
Credit report, background
check,
and a Facebook page for..

27:48.125 --> 27:49.208
'"...Juanita Renaldo."'

27:49.291 --> 27:50.291
(Lilly)
'His next victim?'

27:50.375 --> 27:51.625
According to Facebook

27:51.709 --> 27:53.959
she works
at LifeSpring Fertility.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.458
- You got a number for her?
- Yeah.

28:00.959 --> 28:03.709
Juanita Renaldo?

28:03.792 --> 28:06.417
My name's Detective Rush,
Philadelphia Police.

28:06.500 --> 28:09.250
I need to know where she is now.

28:09.333 --> 28:12.625
- 'Map and train schedule.'
- 'Today?'

28:13.250 --> 28:14.417
Okay, thank you.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.959
Juanita Renaldo
has been out of town.

28:17.041 --> 28:18.750
Yoga retreat. Comes back today.

28:18.834 --> 28:21.625
On a train into
30th Street
Station.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.709
There she is.

28:48.792 --> 28:51.041
(Yates)
'We've got her.
Bring the van around.'

28:54.208 --> 28:55.291
Juanita Renaldo.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.542
We need you to
come with us now.

28:57.625 --> 28:59.959
- What's going on?
- We don't have time to
explain.

29:00.041 --> 29:02.000
- We got to move.
- I don't understand.

29:03.583 --> 29:04.667
You understand now?

29:14.083 --> 29:15.709
He's heading to the subway.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.083
I got him.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.709
Cavanaugh.

29:26.041 --> 29:27.250
[panting]
You move a muscle..

29:27.333 --> 29:29.500
...I'll blow your
freakin' head off.

29:36.792 --> 29:38.417
<i>(Juanita)</i>
<i>I don't get it.</i>

29:38.500 --> 29:40.000
Who'd want to kill me?

29:40.083 --> 29:42.166
You recognize the name
Claire Shepard?

29:42.250 --> 29:45.458
She's been a patient at
the clinic for a couple
years.

29:45.542 --> 29:47.667
Her husband Paul.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.750
Oh, God, this guy?

29:49.834 --> 29:51.959
Did something
happen between you?

29:53.208 --> 29:55.500
I was just trying to help him.

29:59.542 --> 30:01.375
I'm sorry. This is declined too.

30:01.458 --> 30:04.125
Well, i-i-it must be
some sort of mistake.

30:04.208 --> 30:05.458
I'm sure it is.

30:05.542 --> 30:07.959
Well, could you maybe
try, uh, splitting it

30:08.041 --> 30:09.375
across a couple of these?

30:09.458 --> 30:11.583
I-I can't do that, sir.

30:12.625 --> 30:14.750
Please, y-you
have to help
me.

30:14.834 --> 30:16.417
My wife and I have been
coming here for months.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.792
We've tried and tried.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.959
Don't turn us away.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.625
Dr. Shandir sponsors
these experimental trials.

30:25.709 --> 30:27.375
It's an option if you
can't afford the cycle.

30:27.458 --> 30:28.750
I can afford it.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.959
I've been affording it.
It just hasn't worked!

30:31.041 --> 30:33.500
Please, don't
raise
your voice to me.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.083
'I'm just trying to help.'

30:35.166 --> 30:37.083
Is there a problem, Paul?

30:37.166 --> 30:39.834
(Paul)
'No, no, no, sweetheart.'

30:39.917 --> 30:41.834
There's no problem.

30:41.917 --> 30:43.000
Right?

30:43.083 --> 30:45.834
Sir, just take
the card and go home.

30:54.625 --> 30:56.583
Come on, sweetie.

30:59.834 --> 31:02.166
A lot of people come
through that clinic.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.500
It was sad.

31:03.583 --> 31:05.041
Guy really wanted a child.

31:05.125 --> 31:07.250
What about
the experimental trial?

31:07.333 --> 31:09.875
Supposed to start last month.

31:09.959 --> 31:12.583
He calls up
and cancels just
before.

31:12.667 --> 31:14.291
I told him he couldn't
get back in the program

31:14.375 --> 31:15.709
if he changed his mind.

31:15.792 --> 31:17.208
Did he threaten you?

31:17.291 --> 31:19.166
No.

31:19.250 --> 31:21.959
Just said it didn't matter.

31:22.041 --> 31:23.667
Nobody cared anyway.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.500
So Juanita was supposed
to be target number four

31:28.583 --> 31:31.959
just like Fred Norris
who pitied his father.

31:32.041 --> 31:33.291
But he failed.

31:33.375 --> 31:35.750
Juanita's in protective custody.

31:35.834 --> 31:37.000
So, what's his next move?

31:37.083 --> 31:39.792
Take himself
out,
just like dad.

31:39.875 --> 31:42.125
What's Bill say to
his son in that note?

31:42.208 --> 31:43.750
"To my son Paul..

31:43.834 --> 31:46.750
...I'm sorry I'm too
weak to take you with me."

31:46.834 --> 31:48.792
I keep thinking
about what Claire
said

31:48.875 --> 31:51.375
that Paul would
never leave her
behind.

31:51.458 --> 31:52.792
All he ever wanted
was a family.

31:52.875 --> 31:54.250
He was willing to
give up his business

31:54.333 --> 31:55.750
if it meant having a child.

31:55.834 --> 31:59.792
But he cancels his appointments
at the...fertility clinic.

31:59.875 --> 32:02.041
- "Nobody cares."
- Yeah, he's done.

32:02.125 --> 32:04.458
He's gonna take himself out
and take Claire with him.

32:08.083 --> 32:11.125
- No answer at Claire's house.
- Agent's not responding
either.

32:11.208 --> 32:13.125
Paul's already there.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.875
Officer down. Shots fired.

32:50.125 --> 32:53.291
(woman on TV)
'I think you can
understand me, though.'

32:53.375 --> 32:55.458
'I think behind
your eyes you're..'

32:55.542 --> 32:58.625
'...you're just
as alert as ever..'

32:58.709 --> 33:01.125
They're going to say
things that aren't fair.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.792
Blow them out of proportion.

33:06.667 --> 33:09.917
But you know me.
You've always known me.

33:11.583 --> 33:14.208
So, uh, why do you
want to work here?

33:14.291 --> 33:16.917
The hours are long.
We don't pay very
well.

33:17.000 --> 33:18.458
The boss is a stickler.

33:18.542 --> 33:21.709
[chuckles]
I like movies.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.125
Who doesn't?

33:24.041 --> 33:25.667
I get lost in movies.

33:25.750 --> 33:28.917
It's like...dreaming
while you're awake.

33:30.333 --> 33:33.625
I don't know. I just
wanted to be closer to it.

33:33.709 --> 33:34.667
I get that.

33:37.375 --> 33:38.625
"East Of Eden."

33:38.709 --> 33:39.917
Oh, yeah.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.500
- Y-you like it?
- Yeah.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.125
Not bad for a melodrama.

33:43.208 --> 33:46.125
[chuckles]
Well, it's a little
more than a melodrama.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.250
That's debatable.

33:47.333 --> 33:48.834
[laughs]
Not
really.

33:48.917 --> 33:50.834
I mean, it's Steinbeck.

33:50.917 --> 33:52.792
Oh.

33:52.875 --> 33:55.125
Okay, smart man.

33:55.208 --> 33:56.166
Convince me.

34:05.041 --> 34:08.417
What you said about the movies,
about living in a dream..

34:10.041 --> 34:13.542
...that's how you've made
me feel all these years.

34:13.625 --> 34:16.625
- Paul, please..
- Shh.

34:16.709 --> 34:17.917
(woman on TV)
'Excuse me, Mr. Trask..'

34:18.000 --> 34:19.458
This part's great.

34:19.542 --> 34:21.125
(woman on TV)
'...daring to speak
to you this way, but..'

34:21.208 --> 34:23.667
(Paul and woman on TV)
...it's awful not to be
loved.

34:23.750 --> 34:26.583
(Paul and woman on TV)
It's the worst thing
in the world.

34:26.667 --> 34:29.333
It makes you mean
and violent and cruel.

34:29.417 --> 34:31.959
(woman on TV)
'And that's the way Cal has
always felt all his life.'

34:32.041 --> 34:33.709
We're in the middle
of something here.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.125
Put the gun down.

34:35.208 --> 34:38.125
You know that's
not going to happen.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.000
How you doing, Claire?

34:40.083 --> 34:41.542
You hanging in there?

34:41.625 --> 34:42.917
Yeah.

34:43.000 --> 34:44.667
(Yates)
'You hear that, Paul?'

34:44.750 --> 34:46.500
You're terrifying your wife.

34:46.583 --> 34:49.208
Why don't you be a good
husband and let her go?

34:49.291 --> 34:51.792
- It'll be over soon.
- 'Is that the master plan?'

34:51.875 --> 34:53.500
Eat a bullet,
just like your father?

34:53.583 --> 34:55.041
My father built something

34:55.125 --> 34:57.375
and it was ripped
from his hands.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.583
I just tried to correct
the mistakes of the past.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.709
- Murdering all those
people--
- Tying up his loose ends.

35:01.792 --> 35:04.709
Balancing the books.
But it didn't matter.

35:04.792 --> 35:07.375
(Lilly)
'Your father's not
a touchstone, Paul.'

35:07.458 --> 35:11.125
He was bad in business,
and he blamed everyone else.

35:11.208 --> 35:13.208
'He could have tried again.'

35:13.291 --> 35:16.000
He could have made
an effort, for his son.

35:16.083 --> 35:18.166
You think I don't know that?

35:19.250 --> 35:21.542
The man shot himself
30 yards from me.

35:21.625 --> 35:23.500
You see his note?

35:23.583 --> 35:25.625
It said, "Nobody cares."

35:28.208 --> 35:30.125
But I cared.

35:30.208 --> 35:32.792
Why couldn't he see that?

35:32.875 --> 35:36.458
Like...like I
didn't even matter.

35:37.542 --> 35:38.834
I mean, every
step of the way

35:38.917 --> 35:41.208
I just tried to build
something that would last.

35:41.291 --> 35:43.041
He had the drive-in,
so you got

35:43.125 --> 35:45.375
the video stores
to prove him wrong.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.291
- But it ends the same.
- Easy, now, Paul.

35:48.375 --> 35:52.125
Forty five years old, and I'm
every inch the failure he was.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.291
You're wrong.

35:54.375 --> 35:57.667
You've got something he never
had. You've got a real family.

35:57.750 --> 35:59.375
You've got a beautiful wife

35:59.458 --> 36:01.291
'sitting there
right next to you.'

36:01.375 --> 36:03.458
You've got a child.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.583
Juanita from
the fertility clinic..

36:10.667 --> 36:11.792
'...that's what she told us.'

36:13.000 --> 36:14.667
Claire here is pregnant.

36:17.834 --> 36:20.458
- How?
- 'Experimental treatments.'

36:20.542 --> 36:22.583
You canceled the appointment..

36:22.667 --> 36:24.834
Claire went anyway.

36:24.917 --> 36:26.250
Claire?

36:26.333 --> 36:29.417
I...I..

36:29.500 --> 36:32.083
...I just really
wanted to make you happy.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.458
You should have told me.

36:36.542 --> 36:39.417
I was waiting until
I knew it was for
sure.

36:56.041 --> 36:58.625
(Paul)
"Man has a choice, and it's..

36:58.709 --> 37:01.166
...the choice is
what makes him a man."

37:01.250 --> 37:02.583
(Yates)
'That's right.'

37:08.667 --> 37:10.750
Alright. Sending Claire up!

37:24.959 --> 37:27.083
- He's secure.
- I don't care.

37:28.000 --> 37:29.792
What are you doing?

37:29.875 --> 37:31.667
I want to know why.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.333
Why did Barry Jensen
have to die?

37:33.417 --> 37:35.625
[scoffs]
Why do you care?

37:35.709 --> 37:37.375
I'm the one who was with him.

37:39.291 --> 37:40.709
Oh, yeah.

37:41.667 --> 37:43.000
I remember you.

38:08.583 --> 38:11.125
Your phone number, right?

38:11.208 --> 38:12.834
Well, if you didn't
care about that guy

38:12.917 --> 38:14.542
before I shot him,
why do you care now?

38:14.625 --> 38:16.667
We were kids.
He didn't deserve it.

38:16.750 --> 38:18.458
Now, I want an answer. why?

38:18.542 --> 38:19.875
Take it from me.

38:19.959 --> 38:23.417
- Answers...they're
overrated.
- I want an answer!

38:23.500 --> 38:25.041
Diane, don't do this.
He's not worth it.

38:25.125 --> 38:26.959
Don't you get high
and mighty with me.

38:27.041 --> 38:28.458
Roles reversed,
you'd do the same.

38:28.542 --> 38:29.709
What do you prove
by shooting him?

38:29.792 --> 38:30.792
He's got nothing to lose.

38:30.875 --> 38:32.709
Except my child, right?

38:32.792 --> 38:35.291
Nothing to lose
except my unborn
chi..

38:40.959 --> 38:43.041
Claire isn't pregnant.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.542
It's a lie.
Go ahead. Shoot me.

38:49.625 --> 38:51.792
You pull that trigger
and you're doing him a
favor.

38:51.875 --> 38:52.875
- That's all you'll
accomplish.
- 'Shoot.'

38:52.959 --> 38:54.333
I've waited 30 years to find out

38:54.417 --> 38:55.917
why that kid died in my lap.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.750
Now, you're going to tell me
and in exchange for that..

38:58.834 --> 38:59.959
...I'm going to give
you what you want.

39:00.041 --> 39:01.458
End your miserable life.
Is that a deal?

39:01.542 --> 39:03.750
- Diane, we are not--
- This is happening,
detective!

39:03.834 --> 39:05.041
Whether you like it or not.

39:05.125 --> 39:06.750
- I had to prove him wrong!
- Barry?

39:06.834 --> 39:08.583
My father.

39:08.667 --> 39:11.417
Said he was nothing when
he died. Less than
nothing.

39:11.500 --> 39:15.000
But to me, he was everything.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.959
Barry didn't know your father.

39:17.041 --> 39:20.458
He wasn't paying
attention to the
movie.

39:20.542 --> 39:22.834
Just wanted to get
inside your pants.

39:22.917 --> 39:25.083
Would have been
fine any other
day.

39:33.417 --> 39:36.583
But they were playing
"East Of Eden" that night.

39:36.667 --> 39:40.959
And your
boyfriend...
just didn't get it.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.375
Man, I'm telling you,
she's good to go.

39:45.458 --> 39:47.709
I got the peach schnapps,
couple ludes.

39:47.792 --> 39:49.959
- Tonight's the night.
- Excuse me!

39:50.834 --> 39:52.291
Just need a small popcorn.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.875
Easy, little man.

39:54.917 --> 39:56.083
Anyway, she's waiting for me.

39:56.166 --> 39:57.959
Come on. Movie's
about to start.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.208
Dude, so what?

40:00.291 --> 40:02.125
It's "East Of
Eden."
It's a classic.

40:02.208 --> 40:04.333
Yeah, if you say so.

40:04.417 --> 40:05.417
They've played it every year

40:05.500 --> 40:06.792
since this theater opened.

40:06.875 --> 40:08.959
Kid, look around you.

40:09.041 --> 40:11.125
No one's here to see the movie.

40:22.917 --> 40:25.458
If you wanna movie,
go to the cineplex.

40:25.542 --> 40:27.542
Nobody here cares.

40:27.625 --> 40:29.083
Nobody cares.
