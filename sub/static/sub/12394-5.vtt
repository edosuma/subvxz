OH, NO.

00:17.310 --> 00:19.278
GUS, GET DOWN THERE
AND STOP US.

HAVE TO BE THE FEET?

00:20.550 --> 00:21.517
HOW COME YOU
JUST CAN'T BE TALLER?

00:21.550 --> 00:23.108

00:23.150 --> 00:25.516
SEAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

00:25.550 --> 00:27.256
- WELL, THE IMPORTANT QUESTION
IS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HOME?

00:27.290 --> 00:29.781
- I'M A DETECTIVE--
NEW JOB, NEW HOURS.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.650
- CAN YOU WRITE THOSE DOWN
FOR ME?

00:31.690 --> 00:33.521
- GIVE ME THE KEYS.
GIVE ME THE KEYS.

00:33.560 --> 00:35.391
- WE WERE ONLY GONNA GO
AS FAR AS THE END OF DRIVEWAY.

00:35.430 --> 00:37.125
- I DON'T CARE HOW FAR
YOU WERE GONNA GO, SEAN.

00:37.170 --> 00:38.660
YOU'RE NOT OLD ENOUGH

IT'S A LAMBORGHINI.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.609
[siren wailing]
I HAVE PRETI'Y GOOD IDEA

01:51.640 --> 01:53.471
WHO'S BEHIND THIS CARJACKING.
- WHO?

01:53.510 --> 01:55.478
- I'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING
A GROUP OF CAR THIEVES

01:55.510 --> 01:56.875
WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING IN TOWN
FOR THE LAST FEW MONTHS.

01:56.910 --> 01:58.468
STREET RACERS--
THEY FINANCE THEIR LIFESTYLE

01:58.510 --> 02:00.341
BY BOOSTING EXOTIC VEHICLES.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.211
- WHOA, CARLTON.
WATCH IT.

02:02.250 --> 02:04.616
AND HOW DO YOU KNOW
THESE ARE THE GUYS

02:04.650 --> 02:06.789
YOU'VE BEEN INVESTIGATING?
- OH, IT'S THEM. I KNOW IT.

02:06.820 --> 02:11.621
- CARLTON!
- THERE THEY ARE.

02:11.660 --> 02:14.493
- CAR 7-0. WE HAVE VISUAL

02:14.530 --> 02:18.421
TRAVELING SOUTH ON MARIPOSA--
REQUESTING BACKUP.

02:42.290 --> 02:45.259
- DAMN IT.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.429
- CARLTON, WE LOST HIM.
- I'M NOT GIVING UP THAT EASY.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.667
I'VE SPENT TOO LONG TRYING
TO NAIL THIS SON OF A BITCH.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.429
- HE'S HALFWAY
TO THE CITY LIMITS BY NOW.

02:51.470 --> 02:52.960
- O'HARA,
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HELP,

02:53.000 --> 02:54.536
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME
TO GET OUT RIGHT NOW.

02:54.570 --> 02:56.435
- WE ARE THREE MILES

02:58.840 --> 03:01.400
AT THE CORNER
OF 8TH AND WATERFRONT.

03:01.440 --> 03:04.409
- THIS IS DETECTIVE LASSITER.
SECURE THE AREA AND STAND DOWN.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.816
NO ONE APPROACHES THAT VEHICLE
UNTIL I GET THERE.

03:06.850 --> 03:09.171

THE TRUTH *

* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:56.500 --> 03:58.468

- [sighs]
AND THAT, MY DEAR GUS,

04:20.520 --> 04:23.557
IS WHY ONE SHOULD NOT
TEXT AND DRIVE.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.808
- SPENCER, GET AWAY
FROM THE VEHICLE. SHOO.

04:48.850 --> 04:50.715
- THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY
LOVELY CRIME SCENE

04:50.750 --> 04:52.308
YOU HAVE HERE, LASSIE.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.351
I ESPECIALLY ENJOY
WHAT YOU DO WITH THE, UH...

04:54.390 --> 04:55.812
WHAT'S THAT CALLED?
- YELLOW TAPE.

04:55.860 --> 04:57.953
- CRIME SCENE TAPE.
AND IT'S THERE FOR A REASON.

04:57.990 --> 05:00.595
- LOOK, WE ONLY CAME OVER TO
GET A CLOSER LOOK AT THE RIDE,

05:00.630 --> 05:02.860
BECAUSE I USED TO HAVE
ONE JUST LIKE IT.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.323
GUS AND I BUILT IT
FROM SCRATCH IN AUTO SHOP.

05:05.370 --> 05:06.598
- SPENCER,
YOU DON'T WANT THIS CASE.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.335
- OH, BUT I DO.
- BUT YOU CAN'T HAVE IT.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.735
- OH, BUT I WILL.
- STOP IT.

05:09.770 --> 05:11.032
- LOOK, LASSIE,

05:11.070 --> 05:12.776
I KNOW WE'VE HAD
OUR KERFUFFLES IN THE PAST,

05:12.810 --> 05:14.004
BUT LET'S BE HONEST,

05:14.040 --> 05:15.632
THIS HAS ALL THE MAKINGS
OF A PSYCH SPECIAL--

05:15.680 --> 05:17.477
FAST CARS.
- FAST WOMEN.

05:17.510 --> 05:19.102
- FAST FOOD.
- MURDER.

05:19.150 --> 05:20.879
- THAT TOO.
- ENOUGH. THE ANSWER IS NO.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.615
I'VE DONE TOO MUCH WORK
ON THIS CASE ALREADY,

05:22.650 --> 05:23.787
SO I WILL THANK YOU
TO GET LOST.

05:23.820 --> 05:25.014
IN FACT,
I'LL EVEN HELP YOU.

05:25.050 --> 05:27.382
MILLER, ESCORT THESE TWO
OUT OF HERE PLEASE.

05:27.420 --> 05:28.887
- WELL, IN THAT CASE,

05:28.920 --> 05:30.888
I GUESS WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO RACE YOU FOR IT.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.921
WHAT?

05:34.430 --> 05:36.057
[car doors open, close]

05:36.100 --> 05:38.989
[engine turning]

05:39.030 --> 05:41.760

05:41.800 --> 05:45.759
- GO GIVE 'EM A TICKET.

05:45.810 --> 05:47.368
[scoffs]

05:53.820 --> 05:54.741
WE KNOW THE LAMBORGHINI

05:54.780 --> 05:56.782
WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY
90 MILES AN HOUR

05:56.820 --> 05:58.617
WHEN THE DRIVER WAS KILLED,

05:58.650 --> 06:00.049
SO WE CAN EXT RAPOLATE
THE SHOOTER'S LOCATION

06:00.090 --> 06:01.648
BASED ON HOW LONG IT TOOK

06:01.690 --> 06:02.918
THE DEAD MAN'S CAR
TO COME TO A STOP.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.780
- WELL, HOW DID THE SHOOTER
EVEN FIND HIM?

06:04.830 --> 06:06.798
- WE FOUND AN ILLEGAL
TRACKING DEVICE UNDER THE HOOD.

06:06.830 --> 06:09.890
NOW WATCH.

06:09.930 --> 06:11.067
- AWESOME DRIVING.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.658
- THANK YOU, MCNAB.

06:12.700 --> 06:13.598
YOU KNOW, THERE'S ACTUALLY
QUITE A BIT MORE

06:13.640 --> 06:15.938
TO PURSUIT DRIVING
THAN MOST PEOPLE THINK.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.062
- I WAS TALKING
ABOUT THE OTHER GUY.

06:17.110 --> 06:18.759
- WATCH FOR THE FLASH, GUS.

06:18.810 --> 06:19.936
SOON AS LASSIE HITS 88,

06:19.980 --> 06:21.936
HE GOES BACK IN TIME,

06:21.980 --> 06:23.948
AND THIS TIME HE DOES NOT GO
TO THE PROM WITH HIS SISTER.

06:23.980 --> 06:25.447
- IT WAS HIS MOTHER,

06:25.480 --> 06:26.777
AND IT WAS THE ENCHANTMENT
UNDER THE SEA DANCE.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.809
- COME ON, MAN,
IT WAS A TH ROWAWAY,

06:27.850 --> 06:28.817
SO WE COULD MAKE AN ENTRANCE.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.408
- BUT YOU GOT IT WRONG.

06:30.450 --> 06:32.088
- I CAN'T DO THIS
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.918
- SPENCER, I AM TRYING
TO INVESTIGATE A MURDER,

06:34.960 --> 06:36.780
SO UNLESS YOU HAVE
A REASON TO BE HERE,

06:36.830 --> 06:38.821
LEAVE.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.921
- OH, I HAVE A REASON.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.699
I'M GETTING THE SHOOTER
WAS IN A SECOND CAR,

06:47.740 --> 06:50.004

FOUND ON STREET-RACING,

06:50.040 --> 06:51.462
HOT-ROD-TYPE VEHICLES.

06:51.510 --> 06:52.829
- TELL ME SOMETHING
I DON'T KNOW.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.007
- ALL RIGHT,
AMERICA'S NEVER LOST A WAR

06:55.040 --> 06:57.076
WHEN DONKEYS WERE IN USE.

06:57.110 --> 06:58.702
AND THE LAMBORGHINI'S

06:58.750 --> 07:00.445
VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER
WAS ALTERED,

07:00.480 --> 07:02.072
WHICH MEANS
IT WAS STOLEN BEFORE.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.712
- I KNEW THAT ALREADY
AS WELL--

07:03.750 --> 07:05.217
THE PART ABOUT THE VIN NUMBER,
NOT THE DONKEYS.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.854
THAT'S AN INTERESTING FACT.

07:06.890 --> 07:09.450
WHAT I NEED TO KNOW
IS WHERE THE SHOOTER'S CAR WAS.

07:09.490 --> 07:10.889
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST EXTRAPOLATE

07:10.930 --> 07:12.488
BASED ON HOW LONG IT TOOK

07:12.530 --> 07:14.122
FOR THE DEAD MAN'S CAR
TO COAST TO A STOP?

07:14.160 --> 07:15.627
- YEAH. WHAT CHOCOLATE EINSTEIN
JUST SAID.

07:18.900 --> 07:23.769
UM, LASSIE, ARE YOU HUMMING...
DANGER MUSIC?

07:23.810 --> 07:25.903
- WE'RE DONE HERE.

07:25.940 --> 07:27.874
O'HARA, WE GOT AN I.D.
ON THAT VICTIM YET?

07:27.910 --> 07:29.707
- HIS NAME IS MAX CONTRERAS.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.968
HE'S A KNOWN STREET RACER,
HAS A LONG LIST OF PRIORS.

07:32.010 --> 07:33.841
AND GET THIS--
HE'S A HUGE GAMBLER.

07:33.880 --> 07:36.246
OWES A BUNDLE TO NONE OTHER
THAN LOGAN PAGET.

07:36.280 --> 07:37.918
- WHO'S THAT?

07:37.950 --> 07:39.781
- PAGET'S A BIG TIME
EXOTIC-CAR COLLECTOR

07:39.820 --> 07:41.515
AND SUSPECT ED LOAN SHARK.
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

07:41.560 --> 07:43.858
BY THE WAY,
IT'S PRONOUNCED "PA-JAY."

07:43.890 --> 07:45.721
- NO, IT ISN'T.
- IT IS WHEN I SAY IT.

07:45.760 --> 07:47.796
NOW, LET'S SADDLE UP
AND GO TALK TO THIS FROG.

07:47.830 --> 07:51.027
- HE IS NOT FRENCH, SHAWN,
AND THAT TERM IS A SLUR.

07:51.070 --> 07:52.765
- OH, PLEASE.
THEY WON'T BE OFFENDED.

07:52.800 --> 07:54.131
THE FRENCH ARE KNOWN FOR
THEIR WONDERFUL SENSE OF HUMOR.

07:54.170 --> 07:55.899
- EXCUSE ME.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.862
- YOU'RE NOT GOING
ANYWHERE ON THIS, SPENCER,

07:57.910 --> 07:59.263
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
ON THIS CASE.

07:59.310 --> 08:00.902
- UNDERSTOOD.
DAD.

08:00.940 --> 08:02.032
- THEY'RE ON THE CASE.
- HENRY!

08:02.080 --> 08:03.900
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
CARLTON,

08:03.950 --> 08:05.872
YOU'VE BEEN AFTER THESE GUYS
FOR MONTHS WITH NO LUCK,

08:05.910 --> 08:07.013
AND NOW SOMEONE IS DEAD.

08:07.050 --> 08:08.608
IT'S TIME
FOR ALL HANDS ON DECK.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.140
THAT COMES STRAIGHT
FROM THE CHIEF, NOT ME.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.782
- I DON'T NEED HELP
QUESTIONING PAGET.

08:11.820 --> 08:13.515
- "PA-JAY."
- SHUT UP.

08:13.560 --> 08:14.913
- THAT'S WHY I'M SENDING
SHAWN AND GUS

08:14.960 --> 08:16.689
TO SEE IF THEY CAN FIND
ANY STREET RACERS

08:16.730 --> 08:17.924
THAT CONTRERAS HUNG WITH.

08:17.960 --> 08:18.927
MAYBE THEY CAN HELP.

08:18.960 --> 08:19.927
- WHAT DO YOU EVEN KNOW

08:19.960 --> 08:21.894
ABOUT STREET RACING ANYWAY?

08:21.930 --> 08:23.921
- ONLY WHAT WE LEARNED
FROM THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS,

08:23.970 --> 08:25.562
SO EVERYTHING.
- MM-HMM.

08:25.600 --> 08:27.090
- FINE. DON'T THINK
WE'RE PARTNERS ON THIS.

08:27.140 --> 08:28.767
I'M IN CHARGE.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.062
- I PROMISE TO FOLLOW YOU
TO THE LETI'ER.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.566

ISN'T "Q."

08:31.610 --> 08:33.532
- OR ANY OTHER VOWEL,
FOR THAT MA'I'I'ER.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.571
- SHAWN, YOU'RE TO PLAY
BY THE BOOK ON THIS ONE.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.043
YOU FIND ANYTHING OUT,
YOU MAKE ANY MOVE,

08:37.080 --> 08:38.707
YOU FIRST REPORT TO LASSITER.
GOT IT?

08:38.750 --> 08:41.048
- DONE AND DONE.

08:41.080 --> 08:43.810
- ARE WE REALLY GONNA CHECK
EVERYTHING WITH LASSIE?

08:43.850 --> 08:45.989
- OF COURSE NOT.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

08:46.890 --> 08:48.858
- IT'S AN '83 AVANTI.

08:48.890 --> 08:51.051
THEY ONLY MADE
189 OF THESE THINGS.

08:51.090 --> 08:54.958
ITS DESIGN WAS INSPIRED
BY THE '64 STUDEBAKER AVANTI.

[door closes]
- RIGHT.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.007
- YES?

09:07.040 --> 09:09.133

09:09.180 --> 09:10.704

09:15.020 --> 09:17.580

ABOUT MAX CONTRERAS.

09:17.620 --> 09:18.814
- WE UNDERSTAND YOU KNEW HIM.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.354
- MAX WAS A BUSINESS ASSOCIATE.

09:22.390 --> 09:23.982
- AND?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.828
- HE WORKED
FOR ME OCCASIONALLY.

09:26.860 --> 09:30.159
HE WAS A GIFI'ED MECHANIC...

09:30.200 --> 09:32.361
AN ARTIST,
IRREPLACEABLE--

09:32.400 --> 09:36.734
JUST LIKE ONE OF YOUR PRECIOUS,
PORCELAIN DOLLS.

09:36.770 --> 09:38.135
- I DON'T COLLECT DOLLS.

- YOU LOOK LIKE
THE KIND OF GUY WHO DOES.

09:41.010 --> 09:44.275
- WE ALSO KNOW THAT MAX
OWED YOU A LOT OF MONEY.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.242

WHO OWES THEM MONEY.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.898
- OUCH.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.249
- WHEN DID YOU LAST TALK
TO CONTRERAS?

10:01.300 --> 10:04.019
- AH, IT'S BEEN WEEKS...
WEEKS.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.765
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

10:05.800 --> 10:07.768
I HAVE TO PREPARE THIS BABY
FOR AN AUCTION.

10:07.800 --> 10:10.132
- YEAH, JUST ONE MORE QUESTION.
YOU--

10:10.170 --> 10:12.309
[engine turning, revs loudly]

10:12.340 --> 10:14.808
YOU WERE THE--

10:14.840 --> 10:15.909
YOU'RE THE REGI--

10:15.940 --> 10:18.943
WOULD YOU TURN THAT OFF?

10:18.980 --> 10:21.949
TURN OFF THE CAR!

10:21.980 --> 10:23.641
YOU'RE THE REGISTERED OWNER

10:23.690 --> 10:25.009
OF THE VEHICLE
THAT MAX WAS DRIVING

10:25.050 --> 10:26.039
THE NIGHT HE WAS MURDERED.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.318
- YEAH.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.316
IT WAS TAKEN
FROM A RESTAURANT VALET.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.783
- THAT'S INTERESTING,
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ANY RECORD

10:31.830 --> 10:33.354
OF YOU REPORTING IT STOLEN.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.698
- HMM.
MUST HAVE SLIPPED MY MIND.

10:35.730 --> 10:37.664
- SEE, I THINK
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.395
- MAYBE I JUST HAVE
THAT KIND OF FACE.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.332
- DUDE, WE'VE BEEN
TO FIVE OF THESE PLACES,

10:48.380 --> 10:49.802
AND NO ONE'S HEARD ANYTHING
ABOUT STREET RACING

10:49.850 --> 10:50.839
OR EVEN HEARD OF MAX.

10:50.880 --> 10:52.711
- LET'S JUST DO THIS ONE,

10:52.750 --> 10:54.342
AND THEN I'LL GET YOU
SOME ASTRONAUT ICE CREAM.

10:54.380 --> 10:56.314
- DAMN RIGHT YOU WILL.
- EXCUSE US.

10:56.350 --> 10:57.942
- HELLO.
- OOH.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.446
I'M SHAWN.

10:59.490 --> 11:03.722
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE,
M.C. CLAP YO HANDZ.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.387
- WITH A "Z."

11:05.430 --> 11:07.193
- WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME STREET-RACING ACTION.

11:07.230 --> 11:08.788
- OR ANY KIND OF ACTION.

11:08.830 --> 11:09.967
- DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.729
SO YOU CAN
GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE...

11:11.770 --> 11:13.988
WITH A "Z."

11:24.880 --> 11:26.745
- DUDE, SHE'S LYING.

11:26.780 --> 11:28.839
- I KNOW.
THERE'S NO "Z" IN "ASSES."

11:28.880 --> 11:30.939
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT THE STREET RACING.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.016
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
YEAH.

11:45.470 --> 11:47.028
WHAT?

11:47.070 --> 11:49.868
SERIOUSLY.
DUDE, DO THAT AGAIN.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.265
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO COME UP
WITH AN ENTRANCE BIT LIKE THAT

11:52.310 --> 11:55.279
SINCE I ACCIDENTALLY THREW GUS'
WALLET INTO A FIREPLACE.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.449
- I KNEW A SQUIRREL DIDN'T SWIPE
IT OFF A WINDOW SILL.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.244
- THERE WAS A SQUIRREL OUTSIDE,
AND IT WAS EYEING YOUR WALLET.

12:00.280 --> 12:01.975
- YOU LYING BASTARD.

12:04.020 --> 12:05.885
- YOU RUINED MY WALLET
AND BLAMED IT ON AN ANIMAL.

12:05.920 --> 12:08.115
- SQUIRRELS BITE, GUS,
AND YOU WANTED TO BELIEVE IT.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.889
- OH, HEY.
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU GUYS?

12:09.930 --> 12:12.057
- THEY'RE NOBODIES.

12:12.090 --> 12:14.888
- AND BY "NOBODIES," SHE MEANS
EXPERIENCED STREET RACERS

12:14.930 --> 12:16.795
WHO ALSO HAPPEN TO DABBLE
IN FLATULENCE.

12:16.830 --> 12:18.866
- WHAT?
- I'M SORRY. STAMP COLLECTING.

12:18.900 --> 12:20.458
- IT'S "PHILATELY," SHAWN.

12:20.500 --> 12:22.195
- NO, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S THE WORD FOR FARTING.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.901
- YOU NEED TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE.

12:23.940 --> 12:26.158
- DAMN, GIRL.
- HOLD ON. TAKE IT EASY, GINA.

12:26.210 --> 12:27.905
CLEARLY THESE GUYS ARE INSANE.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.908
THEY'RE JUST LOOKING
TO HAVE SOME FUN.

12:29.950 --> 12:33.340
- I RACE HARD.
YOU RACE HARD.

12:33.380 --> 12:34.938
YOU'RE AN AWESOME KEY FLIPPER.

12:34.980 --> 12:36.277
I CAN PLAY
SEWING THE SEEDS OF LOVE

12:36.320 --> 12:37.287
ON THE RECORDER.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.878
HE HAS THAT HEAD.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.456
NOW WE ALL KNOW EACH OTHER.

12:40.490 --> 12:42.151
WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
WHERE THE NEXT RACE IS?

12:42.190 --> 12:43.885
- WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- SHAWN.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.488
_ THERE'S AN OLD SAYING,
SHAWN.

12:45.530 --> 12:49.455
IF YOU NEED TO ASK,
THEN YOU DON'T BELONG THERE.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.094
- I KNEW THAT.
- THEN WHY'D YOU ASK?

12:52.130 --> 12:54.291
- WELL, IF YOU MUST KNOW,
IT'S A RH ETORICAL QUESTION.

12:54.340 --> 12:55.796
SORT OF LIKE "WHERE'S WALDO?"

12:55.840 --> 12:57.933
OR "ARE YOU SMARTER
THAN A FIFTH GRADER?"

12:57.970 --> 13:00.973
- IF YOU CAN FIND THE RACE,
HAPPY TO SEE YOU THERE.

13:01.010 --> 13:01.999
- COOL, MAN.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.918
GUS, FOR GOODNESS SAKE,
CAREFUL.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.520
I'M SORRY.
HE'S ALL THUMBS.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.366
- ARE YOU GUYS DONE HERE?

13:25.400 --> 13:28.233
- SORRY, AGAIN, ABOUT THAT.

13:28.270 --> 13:29.999
OH, MY...

13:42.450 --> 13:44.839
- YOU'RE MAKING A MESS.
I HAD THAT PERFECT LY ORGANIZED.

13:44.890 --> 13:45.982
- I NEED A MAP.
WHERE'S THE MAP?

13:46.020 --> 13:47.510
- UNDER MY BACKUP BREATH MINTS,

13:47.560 --> 13:48.959
NEXT TO MY LAVENDER SCALP OIL.

13:48.990 --> 13:50.526
- LAVENDER SCALP OIL?

13:50.560 --> 13:52.949
BEEN USING THAT STUFF SINCE
WE DID THAT MODEL THING, HUH?

13:53.000 --> 13:56.254
- EVERY DAY. A PLAYER
NEEDS TO SHINE, SHAWN.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.188
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:20.920 --> 14:23.980
- WAIT A MINUTE.
THESE ARE STREETS...

14:24.030 --> 14:26.021
AND TIMES AND DATES.

14:26.060 --> 14:27.527
GUS, I KNOW
WHERE THE NEXT RACE IS.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.551
WE JUST NEED WHEELS.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.022
- UH,
THAT'S A NEGATIVE, SHAWN.

14:31.070 --> 14:32.162
YOU ALREADY
TRICKED OUT MY CAR ONCE.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.428
- YEAH,
AND IT LOOKED AWESOME.

14:33.470 --> 14:35.461
- AND I ALMOST GOT FIRED.
- FINE.

14:35.500 --> 14:38.298
WE'LL HAVE TO FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT, THEN.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.959
- EVERYBODY ELSE'S HOOD
STAYS UP BY THEMSELVES.

14:53.990 --> 14:55.082
HOW LONG
DO I HAVE TO DO THIS?

14:55.120 --> 14:57.054
- GUS, WE HAVE
TO FEATURE THE ENGINE.

14:57.090 --> 14:59.229
WE HAVE TO SHOW IT TO PEOPLE.
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

14:59.260 --> 15:00.591
SIT TIGHT.

15:00.630 --> 15:02.427
I'M GONNA GO GET
MY PAUL WALKER ON.

15:02.460 --> 15:04.064
- THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

15:04.100 --> 15:06.022
YOUR DAD'S GONNA KILL YOU
FOR TAKING HIS TRUCK.

15:06.070 --> 15:07.469
- MONTE CARLO, HUH?

15:07.500 --> 15:09.934
IT'S BLUE, BUT IT'S BOXY.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.608
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, MAN?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.938
- I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MACHINE, MAN.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.574
MY BUDDY MAX
HAD ONE JUST LIKE IT.

15:16.610 --> 15:19.374
MAX CONTRERAS, EL GUAPO.

15:19.410 --> 15:21.344
YOU GUYS KNOW HIM?

15:21.380 --> 15:23.086
- I KNOW HE GOT A BULLET
PUT IN HIS HEAD.

15:23.120 --> 15:24.940
- YEAH, I HEARD THAT.
BUMMED ME OUT.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.480
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
WHO DID IT, WOULD YOU?

15:26.520 --> 15:28.215
- YOU KNOW WHAT WE DO
WITH LITTLE GUYS

15:28.260 --> 15:30.626
WHO COME AROUND HERE
ASKING BITCH-ASS QUESTIONS?

15:30.660 --> 15:32.252
- I'M GUESSING
HE DOESN'T BREAK INTO SONG.

15:32.290 --> 15:33.723
- NO, WE KICK
THEIR BITCH ASSES.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.352
- UH...
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:35.400 --> 15:38.369
CHILL OUT, MANNY.

15:38.400 --> 15:39.958
OH. CHILL OUT.
ALL RIGHT?

15:40.000 --> 15:41.092
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO NOTHING.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.630
YOU'RE GONNA TURN AROUND.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.638
YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT OF HERE.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

15:44.670 --> 15:48.231
- [chuckles]

15:48.280 --> 15:50.498
YEAH.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.712
ALL RIGHT.

15:57.550 --> 15:59.745
- SIDE NOTE,
THAT GUY WOULD HAVE KILLED ME.

15:59.790 --> 16:01.758
- YEAH, QUICKLY AND QUIETLY.

16:01.790 --> 16:03.758
- MY BODY TURNS UP
IN A DITCH SOMEWHERE...

16:03.790 --> 16:05.485
- THEY WOULD HAVE
NEVER FOUND YOUR BODY.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.350
- NO BODY.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.254
- AND YET
YOU DIDN'T BACK DOWN.

16:09.300 --> 16:11.996
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T REALLY LIKE TO, UM...

16:12.030 --> 16:13.668
- THINK AHEAD.
- YES.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.669
- YEAH, I UNDERSTAND
THAT APPROACH WELL.

16:16.700 --> 16:18.668
YOU FOUND THE RACE.

16:18.710 --> 16:20.439
- HERE I AM.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.129
- I WON'T SAY
I'M NOT IMPRESSED.

16:22.180 --> 16:25.149
- YOU'RE AWESOME.
YOU HAVE A GREAT CREW.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.410
YOU LOOK LIKE FLEA.

16:27.450 --> 16:29.145
COME ON, GUYS.

16:29.180 --> 16:31.114
GUS, LOOK.

16:31.150 --> 16:32.447
TA- DA.

16:32.490 --> 16:35.459
- [laughs]
THIS IS--THIS IS YOUR RIDE?

16:35.490 --> 16:36.514
SERIOUSLY?

16:36.560 --> 16:37.788
- SHE MAY LOOK LIKE HELL.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.424
SHE MAY SOUND LIKE HELL.
SHE MAY RUN LIKE HELL.

16:40.460 --> 16:42.428
SHE MAY SMELL LIKE HELL.
- SHAWN.

16:42.460 --> 16:46.021
- BUT SHE IS FAST AS HELL.

16:46.070 --> 16:48.038
- I GUESS WE SHOULD DO THIS,
THEN, HUH?

16:48.070 --> 16:49.799
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:49.840 --> 16:51.307
DO WHAT?

16:53.080 --> 16:55.207
- HOW IS THIS A GOOD IDEA?

16:55.240 --> 16:56.798
- WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE ME DO,
GUS, HUH?

16:56.840 --> 16:59.445
BACK DOWN? NO.
GOT TO PROTECT MY REP.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.209
- YOU DON'T HAVE A REP.

17:01.250 --> 17:03.047
- I'M BUILDING IT, DUDE.
DON'T YOU SEE?

17:03.090 --> 17:04.739
IF WE'RE GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM
OF MAX'S MURDER,

17:04.790 --> 17:08.157
WE'VE GOT TO HAVE
SOME STREET CRED.

17:08.190 --> 17:10.158
HEY, NIX.

17:10.190 --> 17:11.680
WE'RE RACING FOR PINKS.

17:11.730 --> 17:15.188
- AS IN PINK SLIPS?
LIKE, OWNERSHIP PAPERS?

17:15.230 --> 17:18.063
- PINK'S HOT DOGS--
I HAVE A COUPON.

17:18.100 --> 17:19.829
- THAT'S MY COUPON.
- IT'S HIS COUPON.

17:19.870 --> 17:22.464
- GOOD, 'CAUSE I'D RATHER
HAVE THAT THAN YOUR TRUCK.

17:22.500 --> 17:25.207
- OH, YEAH?
[engine revs]

17:28.740 --> 17:30.298
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

17:30.350 --> 17:34.116
[engine revs]

17:34.150 --> 17:36.778
- I'M SURE.

17:38.890 --> 17:42.849
[both engines rewing]

17:42.890 --> 17:45.529
- I THINK I CAN TAKE THIS GUY.
- ARE YOU INSANE?

17:45.560 --> 17:48.256
- I HAVE A SECRET WEAPON.
WHA-AT?

17:48.300 --> 17:50.495
- NITROUS?
YOU ARE INSANE.

17:50.530 --> 17:52.327
- YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE HOW
EASY THAT THING WAS TO INSTALL.

17:52.370 --> 17:54.235
- NO, SHAWN,
IT'S INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED.

17:54.270 --> 17:55.760
DID YOU RETUNE THE FRONT END?
- NOPE.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.665
- DID YOU ADJUST THE INTAKE?
- WHAT'S AN INTAKE?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.632
- DID YOU EXCHANGE
THE EXHAUST VALVE?

17:59.670 --> 18:00.773
- JEEZ, GUS, YOU KNOW
SO MUCH ABOUT THIS,

18:00.810 --> 18:01.879
I SHOULD HAVE
HAD YOU INSTALL IT.

18:01.910 --> 18:03.775
- LET ME OUT OF THIS CAR.

18:03.810 --> 18:07.678
[tires squeal]

18:12.820 --> 18:16.756
- COME ON.
COME ON!

18:16.790 --> 18:18.758
COME ON. COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

18:18.790 --> 18:21.554
OKAY, DUDE, READY?
HIT IT!

18:21.600 --> 18:23.124
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.264
- WE CAN WIN THIS THING.
- WE CAN ALSO DIE.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.435
NO!
STOP IT, NO.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.639
-AAH!

18:41.680 --> 18:44.148
- I WON'T FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS!
- THANK YOU!

18:44.190 --> 18:46.317
- I SAID,
"I WON'T FORGIVE YOU."

18:51.290 --> 18:53.394
- VIVA MEXICO!

18:53.430 --> 18:55.455
- WHAT,
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

19:01.570 --> 19:04.733
[crowd whistling,
cheenng]

19:17.320 --> 19:19.208
- WE DID IT!
- HE BEAT US, SHAWN.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.219
- BY SO MUCH LESS
THAN I THOUGHT HE WOULD.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.852
UH...

19:23.890 --> 19:25.585
- I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.188
YOU MUST HAVE ACCIDENTALLY
CUT THE BREAK LINE

19:27.230 --> 19:28.424
WHEN YOU INSTALLED
THE NITROUS.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.223
- PLEASE.
THE ONLY THING I CUT

19:30.270 --> 19:32.192
WAS THAT LONG CABLE GOING FROM
THE PEDALS TO THE REAR WHEELS.

19:32.230 --> 19:34.266
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU, SHAWN!

19:43.780 --> 19:45.247
ARE WE DEAD?

19:45.280 --> 19:46.577
- I'M NOT.

19:46.610 --> 19:48.612
BUT IF YOU ARE,
CAN I HAVE THE $6,218

19:48.650 --> 19:50.208
IN YOUR RAINY-DAY
MONEY MARKET ACCOUNT?

19:50.250 --> 19:51.478
- HOW DO YOU KNOW

19:51.520 --> 19:52.839
EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY
I HAVE IN THERE?

19:52.890 --> 19:54.915
- WILD GUESS.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.995
- WHOA! THAT'S SOME
OF THE CRAZIEST STUFF I'VE SEEN

20:03.030 --> 20:04.224
IN A LONG TIME!

20:04.270 --> 20:05.862
- WHOO!

20:05.900 --> 20:07.765
- YOU KNOW, YOU TWO
HAVE GOT A LOT OF BALLS.

20:07.800 --> 20:08.892
- FOUR, ACTUALLY...

20:08.940 --> 20:11.761
AND A PHANTOM ONE
THAT I CALL RIGBY.

20:11.810 --> 20:12.902
- OR YOUR ASSES
ARE JUST LUCKY.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.909
- LOOK, GINA, DON'T BE...

20:21.280 --> 20:22.918
WE LIVE ON THE EDGE, TOMMY.

20:22.950 --> 20:25.282
- YEAH, WELL, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A LOT OF TALK.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.548
- WE ARE ALL TALK.

20:26.590 --> 20:27.818
- NO, WE'RE NOT.
GUS, WE'RE NOT.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.748
WE'RE ALL ACTION.

20:29.790 --> 20:31.781
- LISTEN, WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
TOMORROW NIGHT AT THE SHOP.

20:31.830 --> 20:34.697
YOU MAKE ME LAUGH.
YOU TWO SHOULD COME.

20:34.730 --> 20:37.699
- WE'LL BE THERE, MAN.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.981
[engine turning]

21:03.020 --> 21:06.558
[engine revs loudly,
tires squeal]

21:10.370 --> 21:13.066
- I ALMOST GOT KILLED PULLING
OUT OF MY OWN DAMN DRIVEWAY.

21:13.100 --> 21:15.967
I WARNED YOU TWO ABOUT GOING
BY THE BOOK ON THIS ONE,

21:16.000 --> 21:17.536
SO UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING USEFUL

21:17.570 --> 21:19.333
FROM THAT LITTLE STUNT,
I'M CUTTING YOU LOOSE.

21:19.370 --> 21:21.577
- DAD, WE'VE GOT SOMETHING
MORE THAN USEFUL.

21:21.610 --> 21:23.407
GUS AND I HAVE IDENTIFIED
MAX'S OLD CREW.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.974
- WE'RE ALREADY MAKING INROADS.

21:25.010 --> 21:26.978
- THAT'S RIGHT.
PRETTY SOON WE'LL GET NICKNAMES.

21:27.010 --> 21:30.309
I'M THINKING
"TORCH" AND "ROAD RASH."

21:30.350 --> 21:31.886
- YOU LIED TO US, PAGET.

21:31.920 --> 21:33.979
- REALLY? HOW SO?

21:34.020 --> 21:35.851
- YOU SAID
THAT YOU HADN'T SPOKEN

21:35.890 --> 21:37.482
TO MAX CONTRERAS IN WEEKS,

21:37.530 --> 21:39.623
BUT YOUR PHONE RECORDS
TELL A DIFFERENT STORY.

21:39.660 --> 21:42.823
IN FACT, YOU TALKED TO HIM
QUITE A BIT LAST WEEK,

21:42.860 --> 21:45.465
INCLUDING TUESDAY NIGHT
AT 8:41.

21:45.500 --> 21:49.334
- RIGHT AFTER MAX
BOOSTED YOUR LAMBORGHINI.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.736
- TELL US AGAIN WHY YOU NEVER
REPORTED YOUR CAR STOLEN?

21:51.770 --> 21:53.874
- I KIND OF BEEN BUSY,
YOU KNOW?

21:53.910 --> 21:55.377
- BULL CROTCH.

21:55.410 --> 21:57.378
MAX KNEW EXACTLY
WHO BOOSTED YOUR CAR,

21:57.410 --> 21:58.877
SO HE MADE YOU AN OFFER.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.571
HE WAS GONNA RECOVER IT
FOR YOU,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.487
AND YOU WERE GONNA ERASE
HIS DEBT.

22:03.520 --> 22:05.010
- ONLY YOU DIDN'T TRUST MAX.

22:05.050 --> 22:06.881
AFTER ALL, HE WAS A THIEF.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.353
- SO YOU CALLED HIM UP,

22:08.390 --> 22:09.982
AND SURE ENOUGH,
HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

22:10.020 --> 22:11.578
HE WAS GONNA KEEP THE CAR
FOR HIMSELF,

22:11.630 --> 22:13.029
SO YOU HOPPED
IN YOUR FASTEST VEHICLE,

22:13.060 --> 22:17.724
YOU TRACKED HIM DOWN,
AND TOOK HIM OUT.

22:17.770 --> 22:22.036
I'VE GOT YOU ON CONSPIRACY
TO COMMIT GRAND THEFT,

22:22.070 --> 22:24.630
AND I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

22:24.670 --> 22:27.503
- OKAY.

22:27.540 --> 22:29.633
YES, I HIRED MAX.

22:29.680 --> 22:33.514
YES, I CALLED HIM
AFTER HE RETRIEVED MY CAR,

22:33.550 --> 22:35.814
BUT HE DIDN'T TELL ME
THAT HE HAD A CHANGE OF HEART.

22:35.850 --> 22:37.010
- WELL, WHAT DID HE SAY, THEN?

22:37.050 --> 22:40.144
- HE SAID SOMEONE WAS AFTER HIM.
- WHO?

22:40.190 --> 22:42.954
- HE DIDN'T GET A CHANCE
TO TELL ME THAT.

22:42.990 --> 22:44.924
BUT FROM THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE,
HE WAS SCARED.

22:44.960 --> 22:50.057
WHOEVER IT WAS, HE KNEW
THEY WERE GONNA GET TO HIM.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.795
- SHAWN,
YOU AGREED THAT LASSITER

22:51.830 --> 22:53.559
WOULD BE POINT
ON THIS INVESTIGATION.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.568
I EXPECT YOU TO HONOR IT.
TELL HIM NOW.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.067
- TELL ME WHAT?

22:57.100 --> 22:59.637
- ALL RIGHT,
IT TOOK A BRUSH WITH DEATH,

22:59.670 --> 23:02.537
BUT GUS AND I WERE ABLE
TO INFILTRATE MAX'S OLD CREW,

23:02.580 --> 23:05.504
AND I'M SENSING THAT IS WHERE
WE WILL FIND HIS KILLER.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.415
- HUH.

23:07.450 --> 23:10.510
BASED ON WHAT PAGET SAYS,
THAT ACTUALLY MAKES SENSE.

23:10.550 --> 23:13.087
WHOEVER KILLED MAX HAD TO BE
A BETTER DRIVER THAN HIM.

23:13.120 --> 23:14.587
MAYBE IT WAS
AN OLD STREET-RACING BUDDY

23:14.620 --> 23:15.951
OR SOMEBODY--
I DON'T KNOW--

23:15.990 --> 23:17.582
THAT HE USED
TO BOOST CARS WITH?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.086
- THINGS WENT BAD
BETWEEN THEM,

23:19.130 --> 23:20.449
MAX DECIDES
TO TAKE THIS GUY OUT.

23:20.500 --> 23:21.990
ADEQUATE JOB, SPENCER.

23:22.030 --> 23:23.463
O'HARA AND I WILL SHAKE
THESE GEARHEADS DOWN.

23:23.500 --> 23:24.922
WHERE CAN I FIND 'EM?

23:24.970 --> 23:27.097
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, LASSIE.
TAP THE BRAKES.

23:27.130 --> 23:30.190
YOU CAN'T JUST GO IN THERE
AND SLAP THESE GUYS AROUND

23:30.240 --> 23:32.959
ALL LIMP-WRISTY, EXPECTING THEM
TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING.

23:33.010 --> 23:34.978
- I'VE NEVER HAD
A LIMP WRIST IN MY LIFE.

23:35.010 --> 23:38.104
- LOOK, THESE DUDES
ARE A TRIBE, ALL RIGHT?

23:38.150 --> 23:39.708
THEY'RE VERY CLOSE-KNIT,

23:39.750 --> 23:41.115
WHICH IS WHY ROAD RASH AND I

23:41.150 --> 23:43.015
WILL BE HANGING OUT
WITH THEM TONIGHT.

23:43.050 --> 23:45.143
- WHY DO I HAVE TO BE ROAD RASH?
- BECAUSE I'M TORCH.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.987
- I WANT
A DIFFERENT NICKNAME.

23:47.020 --> 23:49.113
- THEY ALL KNOW YOU
AS ROAD RASH. EVERYBODY DOES.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.855
IF YOU SWITCH NOW,
THERE WILL BE MASS CONFUSION.

23:50.890 --> 23:52.949
- SHAWN, YOU MADE THAT NAME UP
ONE MINUTE AGO.

23:52.990 --> 23:54.127
- FINE. WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO BE CALLED?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.855
- MELLOW RUSH.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.697
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE
A CRAPPY ENERGY DRINK

23:57.730 --> 23:58.719
THAT GIVES YOU TONGUE HIVES.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.863
HOW ABOUT CRAN KSHAFT?

24:00.900 --> 24:02.959
- THE OLD CANTANKEROUS MAN
FROM THE COMIC STRIP?

24:03.000 --> 24:05.605
- OKAY, FINE.
MS. WHIDDLEBERRY IT IS.

24:05.640 --> 24:06.766
both:
ENOUGH!

24:06.810 --> 24:09.608
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK.
SHAWN IS RIGHT.

24:09.640 --> 24:12.177
IF HE AND GUS CAN GO OUT
AND GET ENOUGH CONCRETE EVIDENCE

24:12.210 --> 24:14.610
TO NAIL THE SHOOTER,
I SAY IT'S WORTH IT.

24:14.650 --> 24:16.140
- YOU GOT SIX HOURS
TO GET ME A SUSPECT,

24:16.180 --> 24:18.011
AND I WANT THE ADDRESS
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE.

24:18.050 --> 24:19.017
- DONE.

24:19.050 --> 24:21.883
YOU READY TO GO,
G-FORCE?

24:21.920 --> 24:23.649
- NOW THAT'S WHAT'S UP.

24:23.690 --> 24:26.887
[both imitate music]

24:40.710 --> 24:42.177
- ALL RIGHT, NOW, LISTEN,

24:42.210 --> 24:45.509
WHEN YOU'RE WITH ME,
WHAT'S MINE IS YOURS.

24:45.550 --> 24:47.916
- CAN I HAVE THAT, UH,
PUKA-SHELL NECKLACE?

24:47.950 --> 24:49.042
- [laughs]
NO.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.787
- NO, 'CAUSE...
I WAS KIDDING.

24:51.820 --> 24:54.516
- DUDE, DID YOU MAKE A CHAIN
OUT OF PAPER CLIPS?

24:54.560 --> 24:56.050
- GUS, I DIDN'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

24:56.090 --> 24:58.650
WHAT I HAD
WAS OFFICE SUPPLIES.

25:05.230 --> 25:07.869
[people cheering]

25:09.340 --> 25:13.834
- WORST CRASH EVER--
PHOENIX, '06, HANDS DOWN.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.302
I'M IN A G.T.O.,

25:15.340 --> 25:17.205
AND I'M RACING THIS SUPRA--
TOTAL RICER.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.676
KICKING HIS IMPORT ASS,
DOING 90.

25:20.720 --> 25:22.039
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
MY BACK END GETS LOOSE.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.718
BOOM, HIT THE GUARD RAIL.

25:23.750 --> 25:25.217
FLIP IT SIX TIMES.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.945
- DAG, STIG.

25:26.990 --> 25:29.857
YOU'RE LUCKY TO BE ALIVE.
- YEAH.

25:29.890 --> 25:31.653
TALKING ABOUT WORST CRASHES,

25:31.690 --> 25:34.056
HOW ABOUT TOMMY LAST YEAR
AT BONNEVILLE?

25:34.100 --> 25:35.556
- OH, MAN. OKAY.

25:35.600 --> 25:37.693
HE WAS TRYING
TO GET TO 200, RIGHT?

25:37.730 --> 25:39.095
FRONT END OF HIS CAMARO
CAME OFF THE GROUND,

25:39.130 --> 25:40.859
FLEW, LIKE, WHAT, LIKE, 50 FEET?
- WHAT?

25:40.900 --> 25:42.697
- BY THE END,
THERE WAS HARDLY ANY CAR LEFT.

25:42.740 --> 25:44.059
IT WAS CRAZY.

25:44.110 --> 25:45.600
- TOMMY WAS IN A COMA
FOR A MONTH.

25:45.640 --> 25:47.972
- IT WAS BARELY THREE WEEKS,
JUST A LITTLE NAP.

25:48.010 --> 25:49.978
I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT AGAIN.

25:50.010 --> 25:51.978
- WHAT, DO YOU HAVE
A DEATH WISH?

25:52.010 --> 25:54.570
- NO, IT'S JUST THE OPPOSITE,
WHIDDLEBERRY.

25:54.620 --> 25:56.747
THEY SAY THAT WHEN
YOU'RE GOING THAT FAST,

25:56.780 --> 25:59.248
THAT'S WHEN YOU REALLY KNOW
WHAT IT IS TO BE ALIVE.

25:59.290 --> 26:01.110
IT'S PURE ADRENALINE.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.129
BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT
THE SPEED AND CHECKERED FLAGS.

26:04.160 --> 26:05.627
ANYBODY WITH THE RIGHT ENGINE

26:05.660 --> 26:07.082
AND ENOUGH HORSEPOWER
CAN DO THAT.

26:07.130 --> 26:09.997
IT'S ABOUT
FREEDOM AND BARRIERS.

26:10.030 --> 26:12.590
NOW, YOU TELL ME
I CAN'T DO SOMETHING,

26:12.630 --> 26:15.030
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
THAT I CAN...

26:15.070 --> 26:18.107
OR I'M GONNA DIE TRYING.

26:18.140 --> 26:21.769
ADRENALINE--
THAT'S GOD'S GREATEST GIFT.

26:21.810 --> 26:23.744
- HOW CLOSE DID YOU GET?

26:23.780 --> 26:26.271
- 187.

26:26.310 --> 26:27.868
I KNOW.
I COULD ALMOST TASTE IT.

26:27.920 --> 26:29.740
- YOU WANT THE ULTIMATE THRILL,

26:29.780 --> 26:31.384
YOU GOT TO BE WILLING TO PAY
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

26:31.420 --> 26:34.719
- POINT BREAK--
[chuckles] NICE.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.649
- I THINK
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT, MAN.

26:37.690 --> 26:40.056
DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

26:47.100 --> 26:49.295
AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, GINA?

26:49.340 --> 26:52.036
AWFULLY QUIET OVER THERE.
HOW'D YOU GET YOUR WAR WOUND?

26:54.780 --> 26:59.001
- VEGAS, '09--
DODGE CHALLENGER.

26:59.050 --> 27:01.018
RAN A RED LIGHT
AND GOT T-BONED BY A BIG RIG.

27:01.050 --> 27:05.043
- YEAH.
MAX WAS DRIVING.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.650
GINA LOSES THE USE
OF TWO OF HER FINGERS,

27:07.690 --> 27:11.057
AND MAX WALKS AWAY
WITHOUT A SCRATCH--

27:11.090 --> 27:13.752
SOME BOYFRIEND, HUH?
- EX-BOYFRIEND.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.051
- WHATEVER.

27:15.100 --> 27:17.159
SON OF A BITCH NEVER EVEN
APOLOGIZED TO YOU.

27:17.200 --> 27:19.668
I'D NEVER
TREAT YOU THAT WAY.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.292
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEVER TRUSTED THE BASTARD,

27:21.340 --> 27:23.069
SO I SAY GOOD RIDDANCE.

27:23.100 --> 27:26.331
- HEY. MAX WAS ONCE
A GOOD FRIEND TO ALL OF US.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.304
THAT'S HOW
WE'RE GONNA REMEMBER HIM.

27:28.340 --> 27:30.979
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.238
- LET'S GO OUTSIDE.

27:37.220 --> 27:38.244
NOT YOU.

27:49.260 --> 27:52.058
- NOW SHE WANTS
TO TALK, HUH?

27:52.100 --> 27:54.864
WE CAN TALK.
OR...

27:54.900 --> 27:57.835
- WHOA. WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THAT'S MY CAR.

27:57.870 --> 27:59.064
- SHE'S A BEAUTY.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.998
NOVA, HUH?

28:01.040 --> 28:05.704
DID YOU KNOW THAT NO VA MEANS
"NO GO" IN SPANISH.

28:05.750 --> 28:07.069
THESE BAD BOYS
DID NOT SELL WELL

28:07.110 --> 28:09.010
IN THE LATIN AMERICAN
COUNTRIES,

28:09.050 --> 28:13.146
EXCEPT, CURIOUSLY, HONDURAS.

28:13.190 --> 28:16.387
STIG AND JUICE BOX REALLY, UH--
REALLY HATING ON MAX IN THERE.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.354
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

28:18.390 --> 28:20.119
- YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.993
- OH, YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

28:23.030 --> 28:24.463
- HMM.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.962
OOH.

28:32.010 --> 28:34.274
HEY. RELAX.
I THINK WE GOT THIS BACKWARDS.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.005
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.746
I'M LOOKING FOR A WIRE.

28:37.780 --> 28:39.304
- A WIRE?

28:39.350 --> 28:41.875
ARE YOU CRA--
ARE YOU CRAZY, GINA?

28:41.920 --> 28:43.911
YOU THINK I'M A COP?
I'M NOT A COP.

28:43.950 --> 28:46.043
I'M A CAR GUY
JUST LIKE YOU,

28:46.090 --> 28:48.149
EXCEPT YOU'RE A GIRL,
OBVIOUSLY.

28:48.190 --> 28:51.057
- CAR GUY, HUH,
JUST LIKE ME?

28:51.090 --> 28:52.853
- JUST LIKE YOU.
- MOVE.

28:52.890 --> 28:56.849
TELL ME EXACTLY
WHAT YOU SEE HERE.

28:56.900 --> 28:59.061
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE GOT?
WE GOT A...

28:59.100 --> 29:01.136
FAN BELT, GOT A RADIATOR,

29:01.170 --> 29:03.035
[sniffs]
AIR FILTER.

29:03.070 --> 29:05.038
- COWL INDUCTION?
- SURE.

29:05.070 --> 29:06.298
- ROCHESTER FOUR BARREL?

29:06.340 --> 29:09.036
EDELBROCK INTAKE,
OPEN HEADERS,

29:09.080 --> 29:10.138
FOUR-ELEVEN POSI-TRACK?

29:10.180 --> 29:12.045
- EXACTLY.
- EXACTLY.

29:12.080 --> 29:15.948
THOSE ARE THE MODS
ON TOMMY'S CAR, NOT MINE.

29:27.830 --> 29:31.061
TELL ME EXACTLY
WHO YOU ARE, SHAWN, RIGHT NOW.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.160
- ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I SHOULD
START AT THE BEGINNING.

29:34.200 --> 29:36.191
IT'S 1976.

29:36.240 --> 29:38.060
FERNANDO WAS
AT THE TOP OF THE CHARTS.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.237
A GEORGIA PEANUT FARMER
WAS LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD...

29:43.410 --> 29:46.049
- AAH! NOW, GINA,
DON'T DO ANYTHING CRAZY.

29:46.080 --> 29:47.809
- WE DON'T HIT WOMEN.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.913
- FREEZE! GET UP!

29:51.950 --> 29:53.247
- STEP AWAY
FROM THE FIREARM!

29:53.290 --> 29:55.508
- BACK OFF, NOW!

30:04.130 --> 30:05.392
- GET YOUR HAND OFF ME, COP!

30:05.430 --> 30:07.227
[whispers] PUNCH ME IN THE FACE.
- WHAT?

30:07.270 --> 30:09.090
- YOU'RE GONNA BLOW MY COVER.
NOW PUNCH ME IN THE FACE.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.131
- I'M NOT GONNA PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.501
- RONALD REAGAN
WAS A TERRIBLE PRESIDENT.

30:12.540 --> 30:15.236
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

30:15.280 --> 30:18.101
- I'LL GO QUIETLY.

30:18.150 --> 30:20.038
- GET UP!

30:30.660 --> 30:32.389
- THERE THEY ARE.

30:32.430 --> 30:34.523
NICE WORK, GUYS.
- THANK YOU, BUZZ.

30:34.560 --> 30:36.494
- NO, I MEANT NICE WORK
GETTING OWNED BY A GIRL.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.168
- OKAY.

30:38.200 --> 30:39.963
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,
WE DID NOT GET OWNED.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.399
WE REFUSED TO FIGHT BACK.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.862
- WE DON'T HIT WOMEN.
- THAT'S RIGHT.

30:42.900 --> 30:47.303
- UH, NO,
BUT APPARENTLY SHE DOES.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.376
- WE GOT THE PRELIMINARY
BALLISTICS ON GINA'S GUN.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.139
IT WAS USED
TO KILL MAX CONTRERAS.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.545
- GINA WAS THE SHOOTER?

30:52.580 --> 30:54.047
- NOT GINA--
THAT WAS HER ALIAS.

30:54.080 --> 30:55.877
HER REAL NAME
WAS MARY ARMSTRONG.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.138
- I ALMOST MADE OUT WITH A WOMAN
NAMED MARY ARMSTRONG?

30:58.190 --> 30:59.885
- YOU WEREN'T ABOUT TO MAKE OUT
WITH ANYBODY.

30:59.920 --> 31:01.410
- SAYS WHO?
SHE KICKED YOU IN THE BELLY.

31:01.460 --> 31:03.155
- AFTER I DISARMED HER
AND SAVED YOUR BUTT.

31:03.190 --> 31:05.124
- I'M SORRY.

31:05.160 --> 31:06.889
SHE JUST DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE A MARY ARMSTRONG TO ME.

31:06.930 --> 31:08.420
MARIA, SURE.

31:08.460 --> 31:09.996
MARISOL, MAN DINGA. ..

31:10.030 --> 31:11.566
- GUYS,
HER NAME'S NOT IMPORTANT.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.898
WHAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT
SHE WAS MAX'S EX-LOVER

31:13.940 --> 31:15.931
AND PART OF THE CREW
THAT STOLE PAGET'S LAMBORGHINI.

31:15.970 --> 31:17.437
MAX BETRAYED THEM
WHEN HE STOLE IT BACK,

31:17.470 --> 31:19.529
SO SHE WENT AFTER HIM
AND TOOK HIM OUT.

31:19.570 --> 31:21.071
- AND THE GOOD NEWS,
GENTLEMEN,

31:21.110 --> 31:23.578
IS THAT SHE IS GOING AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME.

31:23.610 --> 31:26.579
YOUR LUNCH MONEY IS SAFE.

31:26.610 --> 31:29.477
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
GUYS, THE BIG SCORE HERE

31:29.520 --> 31:31.579
IS THAT WE ALL
WORKED TOGETHER.

31:31.620 --> 31:35.408
I THINK
WE'VE TURNED A CORNER.

31:35.460 --> 31:38.224
GREAT WORK.

31:41.060 --> 31:42.618
- I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
THAT SHOOK OUT AT ALL.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.423
LASSIE SMUGLY
BREAKING DOWN THE CASE,

31:44.470 --> 31:46.165
PEOPLE LAUGHING
AT OUR EXPENSE,

31:46.200 --> 31:48.339
GINA TURNS OUT TO BE MARY--
IT'S ALL VERY VEXING.

31:48.370 --> 31:50.497
DON'T YOU FEEL VEXED?
- NO, WE SOLVED THE CASE.

31:50.540 --> 31:52.201
IT ALL WORKED OUT THE WAY
IT SHOULD BE.

31:52.240 --> 31:53.559
- NO, THAT IS WHAT
IS DISTURBING ME.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.975
IT NEVER WORKS OUT
THE WAY IT SHOULD.

31:55.010 --> 31:56.329
IT'S NOT OUR PROCESS.

31:56.380 --> 31:57.631
OUR PROCESS IS MESSY.
IT'S HAPHAZARD.

31:57.680 --> 32:00.171
IT'S DEFINITELY
NOT LIKE THAT.

32:00.210 --> 32:01.609
I DON'T BUY IT.

32:01.650 --> 32:04.642
- WELL, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA GET IT FOR FREE.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.522
[tires screech]

32:11.560 --> 32:13.619
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?
YOU'RE DRIVING LIKE A MANIAC.

32:13.660 --> 32:15.958
- I THINK THESE CAR PEOPLE
ARE RUBBING OFF ON ME, GUS.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.627
I'M DOING FAST AND FURIOUS.

32:17.660 --> 32:19.491
I'M LIVING LIFE
A QUARTER MILE AT A TIME.

32:19.530 --> 32:20.667
- WELL, WILL YOU GET
OVER THIS THING

32:20.700 --> 32:22.964
AND STOP TALKING
LIKE A MOVIE POSTER?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.458
- WAIT A MINUTE.

32:26.510 --> 32:31.379
[imitating "danger music"]

32:31.410 --> 32:35.517
- GINA LOSES THE USE
OF TWO OF HER FINGERS...

32:35.550 --> 32:39.486
- TELL ME EXACTLY
WHO YOU ARE, SHAWN, RIGHT NOW.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.511
*

32:41.560 --> 32:43.619
- WHY ARE YOU SINGING
LASSIE'S DANGER MUSIC?

32:43.660 --> 32:45.150
- IT'S CATCHY.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.124
AND THE SHOT THAT KILLED MAX
CAME FROM THE RIGHT.

32:47.160 --> 32:48.650
- YEAH, SO?

32:48.700 --> 32:51.123
- SO GINA CAN'T GRIP ANYTHING
WITH HER RIGHT HAND--

32:51.170 --> 32:53.627
NOT A WRENCH, NOT A STEERING
WHEEL, AND DEFINITELY NOT A GUN.

32:53.670 --> 32:55.558
- SO IF SHE WAS THE ONE
CHASING MAX,

32:55.600 --> 32:57.534
SHE WOULD HAVE TO STEER
AND SHOOT WITH THE SAME HAND.

32:57.570 --> 32:59.435
NO ONE CAN DO THAT.
- NOT AT 90 MILES AN HOUR.

32:59.470 --> 33:01.574
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS, GUS?
GINA IS NOT OUR KILLER.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.430
- DON'T YOU MEAN MARY?

33:03.480 --> 33:05.641
- NO. SHE'LL ALWAYS
BE GINA TO ME.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.545
ALL RIGHT, SURE,
"BLACK LOCK."

33:07.580 --> 33:09.047
IF IT WASN'T GINA,
WHO WAS IT?

33:09.080 --> 33:10.638
- IT'S OBVIOUS, SHAWN.
IT'S TOMMY.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.649
- GUS, DON'T BE THE SECOND
DRUMMER FROM .38 SPECIAL.

33:13.690 --> 33:16.158
CLEARLY IT WASN'T TOMMY.
- WHY ARE YOU NOT GETTING THIS?

33:16.190 --> 33:18.283
THESE GUYS ARE LIKE THE MAFIA,

33:18.330 --> 33:19.558
AND TOMMY'S LIKE
A STREET-RACING DON CORLEONE.

33:19.590 --> 33:21.023
THERE'S A CODE OF HONOR,

33:21.060 --> 33:22.550
AND MAX BROKE IT
WHEN HE STOLE THAT CAR.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.261
- EASILY COULD HAVE BEEN
ONE OF THE OTHER DUDES.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.723
STIG.
OBVIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH GINA.

33:26.770 --> 33:28.692
JUICE BOX SAID HE DIDN'T
TRUST THE BASTARD.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.560
- SHAWN, IT'S TOMMY.
YOU KNOW IT.

33:30.600 --> 33:32.568
HE WAS THE ONE
DRIVING GINA'S CAR.

33:32.610 --> 33:34.703
- WHY IS EVERYONE SUDDENLY
BREAKING DOWN THIS CASE BUT ME?

33:34.740 --> 33:36.571
- BECAUSE YOU WON'T.

33:36.610 --> 33:39.044
AND WORSE STILL, YOU BROKE THE
FIRST RULE OF UNDERCOVER WORK.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.571
YOU GOT TOO CLOSE.
YOU'VE GONE ALL POINT BREAK.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.042
- OKAY, THAT'S JUST NUTS.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.446
- IS IT, JOHNNY UTAH?

33:45.490 --> 33:48.618
- DON'T YOU DARE
USE THAT NAME AS A SLUR.

33:48.660 --> 33:50.184
I DON'T HAVE
TO STAND FOR THIS.

33:50.220 --> 33:51.619
GIVE ME YOUR KEYS
SO I CAN STORM OUT OF HERE.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.457
- NO.
TAKE YOUR MOTORCYCLE.

33:53.490 --> 33:55.720
- ALL RIGHT.

33:55.760 --> 33:57.625
HEY.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.423
WINDBREAKER OR PEA COAT?

33:59.470 --> 34:00.619
- WINDBREAKER.

34:05.640 --> 34:09.599
[door opens, closes]

34:09.640 --> 34:11.779
HANDS DOWN
WORST STORMER—OUTER EVER.

34:16.120 --> 34:19.248
- PSYCHIC DETECTIVE--
THAT'S PRETTY COOL.

34:19.290 --> 34:21.451
YOU MUST HAVE SEEN
SOME WILD STUFF.

34:21.490 --> 34:22.616
- OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

34:22.660 --> 34:24.628
ONCE THERE WAS THIS SHARK,
ACTUALLY...

34:24.660 --> 34:26.321
- SHAWN.
- RIGHT.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.625
- THIS KILLS ME TO SAY,
BUT, TOMMY, YOU ARE A THIEF,

34:29.660 --> 34:31.491
AND YOU ARE A MURDERER.

34:31.530 --> 34:34.499
WE KNOW YOU KILLED MAX,
YOU PINNED IT ON GINA,

34:34.540 --> 34:35.791
AND YOU ALMOST
MANAGED TO BAMBOOZLE ME

34:35.840 --> 34:37.262
WITH YOUR
INCREDIBLE AWESOMENESS.

34:37.300 --> 34:39.234
- ALMOST?
- SORRY, DUDE.

34:39.270 --> 34:40.635
I WILL NEVER DOUBT YOU AGAIN.
- NOW WHO'S A LIAR?

34:40.670 --> 34:42.501
- TOUCHE.
LISTEN, IT'S OVER.

34:42.540 --> 34:44.246
WE GOT YOU.
YOU CAN'T KILL EVERYONE.

34:44.280 --> 34:48.376
- [chuckles]
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:48.420 --> 34:52.538
BUT MAX USED THE CAR
AS A--AS AN INSURANCE POLICY

34:52.590 --> 34:54.217
AGAINST ME COMING AFTER HIM.

34:54.260 --> 34:55.887
HE THOUGHT I WOULDN'T RISK
DESTROYING SOMETHING

34:55.920 --> 34:57.785
THAT MEANT SO MUCH TO ME,

34:57.820 --> 35:00.721
BUT HE JUST DIDN'T KNOW ME
AS WELL AS HE THOUGHT HE DID.

35:04.430 --> 35:08.139
I'M NOT THE ONE
TO LOSE, EVER.

35:08.170 --> 35:10.263
HE WAS SLOPPY,
SO HE HAD TO GO.

35:10.300 --> 35:12.530
AS FOR GINA,

35:12.570 --> 35:14.572
EVENTUALLY THEY'RE GONNA
FIGURE OUT THAT SHE'S INNOCENT.

35:14.610 --> 35:16.771
BUT BY THEN,
I'LL BE LONG GONE.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.506
SO, UNFORTUNATELY, THAT JUST
LEAVES ONE THING TO DO

35:19.550 --> 35:21.415
BEFORE I LEAVE.

35:21.450 --> 35:23.270
YOU TELL ME
I CAN'T DO SOMETHING,

35:23.320 --> 35:25.584
I'M GONNA SHOW YOU
THAT I CAN...

35:25.620 --> 35:27.815
OR I'M GONNA DIE TRYING.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.511
- THE LAMBORGHINI.

35:29.560 --> 35:32.381
YOU'RE GONNA
STEAL THE LAMBORGHINI AGAIN.

35:32.430 --> 35:33.579
- PSYCHIC.
TOLD YOU, RIGHT?

35:33.630 --> 35:35.655
- THAT'S INSANE.

35:35.700 --> 35:37.656
IT'S LOCKED UP
IN THE POLICE IMPOUND.

35:37.700 --> 35:40.567
- YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.
THIS IS WHERE YOU COME IN.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.591
YOU'RE GONNA GO,
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET IT.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.699
- IS THAT RIGHT?

35:44.740 --> 35:48.528
SUPPOSE I GO THERE AND TELL 'EM
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE UP TO?

35:48.580 --> 35:52.209
- YOU'RE PROBABLY
GOING TO HAVE TO.

35:52.250 --> 35:56.471
BUT I JUST--I WANT YOU
TO KNOW, SHAWN, THAT, UH...

35:56.520 --> 35:59.717
IF I SEE ANY COPS COMING...

35:59.750 --> 36:03.356
YOUR FRIEND'S GOING TO DIE.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.509
- THAT WAS QUICK.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.872
GUYS AT IMPOUND MUST HAVE
NOT BEEN PAYING ATTENTION.

36:22.910 --> 36:24.446
- NO, THEY WERE.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.471
THEN I BUSTED OUT
THE RICE KRISPIE TREATS.

36:26.510 --> 36:28.876
IT'S LIKE FLYPAPER, MAN.
- [laughing]

36:28.920 --> 36:31.241
- SERIOUSLY,
THOSE THINGS ARE REALLY STICKY.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.484
WHERE'S GUS?

36:32.520 --> 36:34.215
- THIS GUY'S
ALWAYS ENTERTAINING.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.488
YOU KNOW,
I'M GONNA MISS THAT.

36:35.520 --> 36:37.511
- YEAH,
SAVE YOUR COMPLIMENTS, TOMMY.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.221
- TOSS ME THE KEYS.
- GUS FIRST.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.454
- I'M IN HERE.
LET ME OUT!

36:40.490 --> 36:41.798
- SERIOUSLY, DUDES?

36:41.830 --> 36:43.491
THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM
IN THIS CAR.

36:43.530 --> 36:44.929
WHY'D YOU HAVE TO PUT HIM
IN THE TRUNK?

36:44.970 --> 36:46.790
- IT'S A VERY SMALL BACK SEAT.
- LET ME OUT!

36:46.830 --> 36:49.390
[knocking]

36:51.840 --> 36:54.377
- GET OVER THERE.

36:54.410 --> 36:57.231
NOW TOSS ME THE KEYS.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.907
I LIKE YOU, SHAWN.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.316
BUT I WILL KILL YOU.

37:06.690 --> 37:07.941
THAT'S A SMART MOVE.

37:07.990 --> 37:10.550
LET'S GO.
GET OVER HERE.

37:12.690 --> 37:16.694
ALL RIGHT. GOOD.

37:27.540 --> 37:28.529
- WHAT IS THAT?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.808
- COPS PUT A TRACKER
ON THIS CAR.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.546
I'D DO THE SAME THING.

37:31.580 --> 37:35.971
COPS AREN'T STUPID.
I'M JUST SMARTER.

37:36.020 --> 37:38.648
ALL RIGHT, I'D SAY
THEY'RE ABOUT TWO MINUTES AWAY.

37:38.690 --> 37:39.839
BOYS, WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

37:39.890 --> 37:41.778
GET OUT OF HERE, ALL RIGHT?
JUST SCATTER.

37:41.820 --> 37:44.380
- CATCH YOU LATER.

37:44.430 --> 37:46.955
- SEE YA, BOYS.

37:46.990 --> 37:51.427
[tires squeal]

37:51.470 --> 37:53.426
- YOU KNOW, I WAS SERIOUS WHEN
I SAID THAT IT WOULD BE GOOD

37:53.470 --> 37:54.960
TO HAVE A GUY LIKE YOU
COME ALONG.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.865
YOU SHOULD COME WITH US.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.959
COME ON, YOU GOT
THE KAMIKAZE IN YOU.

37:59.010 --> 38:00.830
I CAN SMELL IT.

38:00.870 --> 38:03.338
- IT'S NOT THE KAMIKAZE.

38:03.380 --> 38:05.701
IT'S CK ONE,
FOR MEN AND WOMEN.

38:05.750 --> 38:07.968
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE--YOU'RE FULL OF IT, MAN.

38:08.010 --> 38:10.843
GOD'S GREATEST GIFT--
IT'S NOT ADRENALINE.

38:10.880 --> 38:12.416
IT'S FRIENDSHIP.

38:12.450 --> 38:14.418
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO HURT GUS,

38:14.460 --> 38:15.711
EVEN IF HE BETRAYED ME.

38:15.760 --> 38:18.558
AND HE FEELS
THE SAME WAY ABOUT ME.

38:18.590 --> 38:20.581
[Gus whimpers]
- HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

38:20.630 --> 38:23.793
[distant siren wailing]

38:38.650 --> 38:40.606
- SO WE'RE LETTING HIM GO?

38:40.650 --> 38:41.912
- SHOULDN'T THAT SENTENCE
START WITH,

38:41.950 --> 38:43.747
"HEY, MAN,
THANKS FOR SAVING MY LIFE"?

38:43.780 --> 38:45.486
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

38:45.520 --> 38:47.511
BUT WE'RE STILL LETTING
A MURDERER GO FREE.

38:47.550 --> 38:50.781
- I GOT THREE ZUCCHINI
AND A GOURD THAT SAYS WE'RE NOT.

39:49.150 --> 39:53.587
- THAT CRAZY SON OF A BITCH
ISN'T GONNA STOP.

40:00.690 --> 40:04.694
- NO! NO!

40:04.730 --> 40:07.460
NO! COME ON!

40:09.640 --> 40:12.768
NO!

40:22.620 --> 40:24.747
- MAYBE HE IS.

40:30.720 --> 40:33.621
MOVE IN!

40:43.140 --> 40:45.563
- VEGETABLES
IN THE TAIL PIPE--

40:45.610 --> 40:46.963
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S BRILLIANT OR STUPID.

40:47.010 --> 40:48.637
- PROBABLY STUPID.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.978
- WELL, THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN THE TWO.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.739
- SHAWN...

40:52.780 --> 40:54.645
IT'S STILL ABOUT
FREEDOM AND BARRIERS.

40:54.680 --> 40:56.614
NO REGRETS, BRO.

40:56.650 --> 40:58.880
- YEAH. GOOD LUCK SELLING
THAT TO THE OTHER MURDERERS

40:58.920 --> 41:00.615
IN CELL BLOCK "C," BRO.

41:00.650 --> 41:02.584
- MRS. WHIDDLEBERRY,
NOTHING PERSONAL.

41:02.620 --> 41:04.622
- THE NAME IS GUS.

41:04.660 --> 41:06.582
- MRS. WHIDDLEBERRY?

41:06.630 --> 41:09.599
- IT USED TO BE G-FORCE.
- BRIEFLY, VERY BRIEFLY.

41:09.630 --> 41:11.666
- WELL, SPENCER,
THIS WAS A BIG COLLAR FOR YOU.

41:11.700 --> 41:13.122
CONGRATULATIONS.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.899
IT'S A SHAME I HAVE
TO PUT IN A RECOMMENDATION

41:14.940 --> 41:16.737
FOR YOUR SUSPENSION.
- WHAT?

41:16.770 --> 41:17.998
- YOU STOLE A CAR
FROM THE POLICE IMPOUND.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.632
- HE WAS GONNA KILL GUS.
- HE WAS BLUFFING.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.774
- I'M AFRAID
I COULDN'T TAKE THAT CHANCE.

41:21.810 --> 41:23.903
- YOU DON'T NEGOTIATE
WITH KIDNAPPERS.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.498
IT'S COP 101.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.041
- BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GUS.
HE'S ONE OF US.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.911
- BARELY.
- EXCUSE ME?

41:29.950 --> 41:31.781
- I'M SORRY.
THAT WAS INSENSITIVE.

41:31.820 --> 41:34.789
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS
I'M QUITE FOND OF YOU, GUSTER,

41:34.820 --> 41:36.617
ALTHOUGH PROFESSIONALLY
I DO OFTEN WONDER

41:36.660 --> 41:37.684
WHAT YOU BRING TO THE TABLE.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.927
- CARLTON.
- I'M BEING HONEST.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.554
- OKAY, LASSIE,
THINGS GUS BRINGS TO THE TABLE--

41:42.600 --> 41:45.694
ONE, THE BLUEBERRY.
TWO, THE SUPER SNIFFER.

41:45.730 --> 41:47.618
TH REE, A POSITIVE
WORKING ATTITUDE.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.763
- [laughs]

41:49.800 --> 41:53.702
OH, IT IS SUCH A SHAME
THAT YOU DIDN'T GET TO SEE ME

41:53.740 --> 41:56.038
BEHIND THE WHEEL
OF THAT MACHINE.

41:56.080 --> 41:58.105
- MM-HMM.
- WHAT DO YOU SAY THE TWO OF US

41:58.140 --> 42:00.677
TAKE IT FOR A LITTLE SPIN?

42:00.710 --> 42:02.849
- IT'S STILL EVIDENCE, SHAWN.
- YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.

42:02.880 --> 42:04.643
- NO.
NO, I REALLY DON'T.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.180
- YEAH, YOU DO.

42:06.220 --> 42:07.778
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
THE KAMIKAZE IN YOU.

42:07.820 --> 42:09.708
I CAN SMELL IT
FROM A MILE AWAY.

42:09.760 --> 42:12.729
- THAT'S DISGUSTING.
- IT'S POINT BREAK.

42:12.760 --> 42:13.988
- NEVER SEEN IT.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.725
- Y-YOU'VE NEVER SEEN
POINT BREAK?

42:15.760 --> 42:17.227
- NOPE.
I'VE SEEN FAST BREAK.

42:17.260 --> 42:20.593
- FAST BR--
WITH GABE KAPLAN?

42:25.270 --> 42:27.602
- SPENCER,
GET OUT OF THE CAR!
