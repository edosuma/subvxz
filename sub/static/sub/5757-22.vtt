WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:05.073
WHY WOULD I GIVE
THIS TO HANNA?

00:05.106 --> 00:07.141
IF THIS CAME OUT,
I COULD LOSE MY JOB.

00:07.175 --> 00:10.044
I JUST CAN'T PICTURE
ALISON EVER WEARING THIS.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.612
A PICTURE
OF VIVIAN DARKBLOOM.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.215
VIVIAN TOLD YOU
ABOUT ALISON?

00:14.248 --> 00:15.716
SHE HAD A FRIEND
NAMED ALISON

00:15.749 --> 00:17.318
WHO WAS GETTING
TEXTS FROM SOMEBODY.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.786
IF THIS JONAH HAD
REAL INFORMATION

00:18.819 --> 00:20.454
ALI MIGHT'VE KNOWN
WHO "A" WAS.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.256
THERE WAS SOMETHING
ELSE IN THAT BOX.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.158
$15,000 IN CASH.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.060
WHERE WOULD ALI HAVE
GOTTEN THAT KIND OF MONEY?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.528
EZRA IS LEAVING.

00:27.561 --> 00:30.164
HE'S TAKING THAT JOB
IN NEW ORLEANS.
WHAT JOB?

00:30.198 --> 00:32.333
THE JOB THAT DAD
SET HIM UP WITH.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.135
WHAT DOES THE DILAURENTIS
FAMILY HAVE ON US?

00:34.168 --> 00:35.203
IT'S COMPLICATED.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.305
MY DAD,
IS HE YOUR FATHER TOO?

00:37.338 --> 00:38.606
MELISSA DOESN'T
KNOW EITHER.

00:38.639 --> 00:41.109
DON'T PROTECT HER.
SHE LIED TO US.

00:41.142 --> 00:42.210
CALEB SENT ME AN EMAIL.

00:42.243 --> 00:43.511
SHE'S COMING UPSTAIRS.

00:43.544 --> 00:45.113
ARE WE ABOUT TO SEE
ALISON GET KILLED?

00:45.146 --> 00:47.081
( all gasp )

00:47.115 --> 00:48.082
WHERE IS SHE?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.750
EMILY FIELDS?
YES?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.719
WE NEED TO TALK
TO YOU.
ABOUT WHAT?

00:51.752 --> 00:54.655
MAYA ST. GERMAIN.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.259
( door opens )

01:03.364 --> 01:05.333
SO, WHAT'D THEY SAY?

01:05.366 --> 01:08.136
NOT A LOT.

01:08.169 --> 01:10.404
THE POLICE SAID THAT MAYA'S
PARENTS FOUND A NOTE.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.173
IT LOOKED LIKE
SHE PACKED A BAG.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.246
DO THEY KNOW WHERE
SHE WENT?

01:18.279 --> 01:22.250
THEY WERE ASKING
THE QUESTIONS, NOT ME.

01:22.283 --> 01:26.154
THAT'S NOT FAIR.
YOU'RE HER GIRLFRIEND.

01:26.187 --> 01:29.089
MAYBE. SHE HASN'T
RETURNED ANY OF MY TEXTS.

01:31.392 --> 01:33.127
ANYWAYS, HANNA,
I'M REALLY TIRED.

01:36.497 --> 01:37.731
DID YOU TELL THEM THAT?

01:37.765 --> 01:39.433
THAT I'M TIRED?
NO.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.235
ABOUT THE TEXTS.

01:41.269 --> 01:43.271
EMILY, EVERY DETAIL COUNTS.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.206
I TOLD THEM THAT WE
GOT INTO A FIGHT

01:45.239 --> 01:47.441
AND THAT MAYA
THREATENED TO RUN AWAY

01:47.475 --> 01:49.777
BEFORE SHE'D EVER GO
BACK TO BOOT CAMP.

01:49.810 --> 01:51.078
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.

01:54.948 --> 01:59.553
SHE'LL CALL, EM. OKAY?

02:10.231 --> 02:12.566
IT WASN'T LIKE I WENT
RUNNING TO THE COPS.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.402
YOU LIED TO ME
AND THEN YOU GOT IN A CAR

02:14.435 --> 02:15.469
WITH GARRETT REYNOLDS;
I SAW YOU.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.271
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO WORRY.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.772
I THOUGHT IF YOU KNEW THAT
I WAS TALKING TO THE POLICE--

02:18.806 --> 02:20.441
WHY HIM?

02:20.474 --> 02:22.943
GARRETT WAS IAN'S FRIEND.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.446
AND HE'S BEEN REALLY KIND
TO ME SINCE THE FUNERAL.

02:25.479 --> 02:26.714
HE CHECKS IN ON ME,

02:26.747 --> 02:28.449
HE TAKES ME TO THE
DOCTOR WHEN HE CAN

02:28.482 --> 02:31.685
AND... I NEEDED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.254
ABOUT WHAT?

02:33.287 --> 02:34.722
ABOUT IAN.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.757
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE
THAT I MARRIED THE GUY

02:36.790 --> 02:38.926
WHO WAS CAPABLE
OF KILLING ALISON.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.829
THE NIGHT OF THE
FUNERAL I WANTED TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.764
I'VE BEEN HOLDING
ON TO THIS--

02:43.797 --> 02:46.900
THIS FEELING THAT SOMETHING
WAS WRONG EVER SINCE THEN.

02:46.934 --> 02:50.204
SO YOU WENT TO GARRETT
ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.439
I DID, BUT--

02:51.472 --> 02:54.708
I THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.645
I'VE SHARED
A LOT WITH HIM.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.613
MAYBE TOO MUCH.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.282
LIKE WHAT?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.886
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT SUMMER?

03:05.919 --> 03:08.689
IT SEEMED LIKE MOM AND DAD
WERE CONSTANTLY FIGHTING.

03:08.722 --> 03:13.827
THE DAY ALISON WENT MISSING,
IT STOPPED.

03:13.861 --> 03:16.964
AND I DON'T THINK
IT WAS A COINCIDENCE.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.833
DAD, HE HAD A REALLY
STRANGE REACTION

03:19.867 --> 03:22.336
WHEN HE HEARD THE NEWS.
IT WAS--

03:22.370 --> 03:24.605
IT WAS ALMOST LIKE
HE WAS RELIEVED.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.610
I'M LISTENING.
GO ON.

03:29.643 --> 03:32.346
ONE NIGHT BEFORE
SHE DISAPPEARED,

03:32.380 --> 03:34.415
I CAME HOME LATE.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.784
DAD WAS UP, SOMETHING
WAS BOTHERING HIM,

03:36.817 --> 03:39.320
BUT I DIDN'T
NOTICE AT FIRST.

03:39.353 --> 03:40.588
I WAS A WRECK MYSELF.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.491
I HAD CAUGHT ALISON
FLIRTING WITH IAN AGAIN.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.959
I-- I SENT TEXTS TO--

03:45.993 --> 03:47.395
ALI?

03:47.428 --> 03:49.930
TELLING HER TO
BACK THE HELL OFF.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.266
I TOLD DAD EVERYTHING.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO.

03:52.300 --> 03:54.568
DID YOU SIGN THESE TEXTS?

03:54.602 --> 03:58.306
I DIDN'T HAVE TO.
SHE KNEW WHO THEY WERE FROM.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.940
YEAH, SO WHAT'D DAD SAY?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.542
NOTHING.

04:01.575 --> 04:06.647
HE JUST HAD THIS LOOK
LIKE HE SUPPORTED ME.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.849
AND YOU TOLD
THIS TO GARRETT.

04:08.882 --> 04:11.852
UGH. I NEVER SHOULD'VE
OPENED UP TO HIM.

04:11.885 --> 04:14.888
I WAS JUST VENTING,
TRYING TO SORT
THROUGH MY FEELINGS.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.890
THIS IS NOT GOOD.
WHY?

04:16.923 --> 04:20.293
MELISSA, WE'RE NOT THE ONLY
PEOPLE WHO KNOW ABOUT JASON.

04:20.327 --> 04:22.630
DAD MIGHT'VE
BEEN BLACKMAILED.

04:22.663 --> 04:24.332
WHAT? BY WHO?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.666
ALISON.

04:25.699 --> 04:27.835
JASON FOUND CASH,
A LOT OF IT.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.338
ALI WAS HIDING IT,
AND I ASKED DAD ABOUT IT.

04:30.371 --> 04:32.573
THE BLACKMAIL?

04:32.606 --> 04:34.775
AND HE TOLD ME THAT HE
NEVER PAID ALISON A CENT.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.378
DO WE BELIEVE THAT?

04:41.782 --> 04:44.552
* GOT A SECRET,
 CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:44.585 --> 04:46.954
* SWEAR THIS ONE
 YOU'LL SAVE *

04:46.987 --> 04:48.889
* BETTER LOCK IT
 IN YOUR POCKET *

04:48.922 --> 04:51.425
* TAKIN' THIS ONE
 TO THE GRAVE *

04:51.459 --> 04:53.761
* IF I SHOW YOU
 THEN I KNOW YOU *

04:53.794 --> 04:57.331
* WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID

04:57.365 --> 05:02.035
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN KEEP A SECRET
 IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

05:08.642 --> 05:12.780
SO, YOUR FATHER IS
COMING HOME FROM HIS
CONFERENCE TODAY.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
AND?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.949
AND I KNOW HE'S
VERY EXCITED

05:15.983 --> 05:18.018
ABOUT THE
FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE.

05:18.051 --> 05:21.389
YEAH, WELL,
THE FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE

05:21.422 --> 05:23.591
IS A LITTLE MORE IRONY
THAN I CAN HANDLE RIGHT NOW.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.926
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD LEARN
TO EMBRACE THE IRONY

05:25.959 --> 05:28.729
BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO BE
A LOT OF IT IN OUR LIVES.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.732
MOM, IF YOU COULD
JUST TALK TO DAD

05:31.765 --> 05:32.800
AND TRY AND CONVINCE HIM.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.768
HONEY, AT THIS POINT,

05:34.802 --> 05:36.837
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I'D BE
TRYING TO CONVINCE HIM OF.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.639
WAIT.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.741
WHAT HAPPENED TO LAST NIGHT'S

05:40.774 --> 05:43.076
"I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND
YOU AND EZRA."

05:43.110 --> 05:45.913
I STILL AM. IT'S A PROCESS.

05:45.946 --> 05:49.717
FOR NOW, I DON'T
THINK YOUR FATHER

05:49.750 --> 05:51.685
REALLY NEEDS TO
KNOW ABOUT IT.

05:56.056 --> 05:59.092
( phone rings )

06:01.795 --> 06:03.163
HELLO?

06:03.196 --> 06:04.532
Wilden:
 HEY, ASHLEY.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.500
I TOLD YOU NOT
TO CALL ME AT HOME.

06:06.534 --> 06:07.868
I TAKE IT THAT MEANS THAT YOU
 HAVEN'T TALKED TO YOUR DAUGHTER

06:07.901 --> 06:10.037
ABOUT WHERE SHE
GOT THAT REPORT.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.540
I GAVE IT TO YOU SO YOU COULD
COME UP WITH SOME ANSWERS.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.041
I'M TRYING TO KEEP
HANNA OUT OF IT.

06:14.074 --> 06:16.143
OUT OF IT? SHE'S RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.711
WELL, SO ARE YOU.

06:17.745 --> 06:19.547
MY DAUGHTER IS BEING TARGETED,

06:19.580 --> 06:21.715
AND YOU NEED TO FIND OUT WHO'S
 DOING THIS TO HER.

06:21.749 --> 06:22.950
UNLESS YOU'D LIKE ME

06:22.983 --> 06:24.418
TO TALK TO SOMEONE ELSE
IN THE DEPARTMENT.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.420
( footsteps )

06:26.454 --> 06:27.788
DON'T CALL ME
AT THE HOUSE AGAIN.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.890
ASHLEY, I--
( dial tone )

06:29.923 --> 06:32.426
ASHLEY.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.595
GOOD MORNING.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.897
NOT REALLY.

06:36.930 --> 06:38.966
I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH DAD.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.901
HE BAILED ON TOMORROW
NIGHT'S DANCE.

06:40.934 --> 06:44.037
SAID HE HAD
A PRIOR COMMITMENT.

06:44.071 --> 06:48.476
WORK OR BUSINESS.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.077
BUT, WHATEVER.

06:50.110 --> 06:54.181
I MEAN, I WAS OVER
THAT DANCE LAST YEAR.

06:54.214 --> 06:57.585
YOU KNOW, I COULD TAKE
YOU TO THE DANCE.

06:57.618 --> 07:00.053
HELLO? FATHER/DAUGHTER.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.789
WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU'RE THE ONLY GIRL

07:01.822 --> 07:03.924
WITH DIVORCED PARENTS WHOSE
DAD CAN'T MAKE IT?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.526
NO, BUT I'D BE THE
ONLY ONE LAME ENOUGH

07:05.559 --> 07:07.695
TO SHOW UP AND ADVERTISE IT.

07:07.728 --> 07:09.229
I CAN TAKE THE HEAT.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.998
( scoffs )

07:11.031 --> 07:14.034
I THINK MISSING OUT ON SOMETHING
YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO

07:14.067 --> 07:17.037
IS LAMER THAN GOING
WITH YOUR MOTHER.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.643
OKAY. LET'S DO IT.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.844
ME AND YOU.

07:25.646 --> 07:28.616
( student chatter )

07:28.649 --> 07:31.251
"DO MOM AND DAD KNOW YOU'RE
WATCHING MURDER MOVIES?

07:31.284 --> 07:34.087
THAT WOULD KILL THEM
TO FIND OUT. 'A'"

07:34.121 --> 07:35.989
IS "A" TALKING ABOUT
THE N .A .T. VIDEO?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.992
OF COURSE. "A" KNOWS
WE HAVE THEIR CELL PHONE.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.794
YOU GUYS GET THAT
TEXT FROM "A"?

07:40.828 --> 07:42.996
YES, AND NOW MELISSA'S
THREATENING TO
KILL OUR PARENTS.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.898
I ALREADY TOLD YOU:
MELISSA CAN'T BE "A".

07:44.932 --> 07:47.701
ALISON WAS GETTING TEXTS
FROM THE LAW FIRM YOUR
SISTER INTERNED AT.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.102
YES, BUT SHE EXPLAINED THAT.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.271
MELISSA JUST WANTED ALI
TO LEAVE IAN ALONE.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.274
SO WHAT? WHAT, I GOT CHASED
BY A HOBO FOR NOTHING?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.943
THAT STILL DOESN'T
EXPLAIN WHY MELISSA

07:55.976 --> 07:57.578
GOT INTO GARRETT'S CAR.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.513
DO YOU THINK GARRETT TOLD
HER ABOUT THE VIDEO?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.749
'CAUSE IF SHE KNOWS THAT
SHE'S ON IT AND IF SHE'S "A"--

08:01.782 --> 08:04.518
YOU GUYS,
MY SISTER IS NOT "A".

08:04.552 --> 08:06.954
I WATCHED HER FALL APART
WHEN WE FOUND IAN'S BODY.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.989
SHE HAD NO IDEA
THAT HE WAS DEAD.

08:09.022 --> 08:11.258
SHE WOULDN'T JUST TEXT HERSELF
FROM HER DEAD HUSBAND'S PHONE

08:11.291 --> 08:12.926
AND LOSE IT LIKE THAT.
COULD WE--

08:12.960 --> 08:15.863
COULD WE PLEASE JUST
BREATHE FOR A SECOND?

08:15.896 --> 08:19.767
NO. WE HAVE VIDEO OF FOUR PEOPLE
WHO COULD'VE KILLED ALISON.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.769
OKAY? THEY WERE IN HER
BEDROOM THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.804
CAN'T WE GET IN TROUBLE
FOR WITHDRAWING EVIDENCE?

08:23.837 --> 08:24.938
I THINK YOU MEAN WITHHOLDING.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.140
Aria:
LOOK, SPENCER'S RIGHT.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.742
WE'VE JUMPED THE GUN BEFORE.

08:28.776 --> 08:30.243
WE'VE GONE TO THE COPS.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.580
AND WE ENDED
UP LOOKING GUILTY.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.948
YEAH, AND THEY ALREADY
THINK THAT WE STOLE
SOMETHING FROM THE MORGUE.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.984
I DON' THINK THAT WE
SHOULD GIVE THIS TO THEM.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.852
LOOK, I KNOW THAT
I'M ASKING A LOT,

08:39.886 --> 08:43.256
BUT, I THINK THAT I MIGHT
HAVE A WAY TO FIND OUT MORE.

08:43.289 --> 08:46.193
SO, CAN YOU GUYS JUST GIVE ME
A CHANCE TO GET INTO THIS?

08:47.895 --> 08:51.599
OKAY.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.916
I HAVE GOT TO FIND AN
OBSTETRICIAN IN THE CITY.

09:08.949 --> 09:12.786
ALL THIS BACK AND FORTH FOR
THESE APPOINTMENTS IS JUST--

09:12.820 --> 09:14.154
FROM DAD?

09:14.187 --> 09:17.557
"LOOKING FORWARD
TO THE DANCE."

09:23.330 --> 09:27.067
WOW. DAD WENT
A LITTLE BIT OVERBOARD.

09:27.100 --> 09:30.003
IT'S CALLED
OVERCOMPENSATING.

09:30.037 --> 09:33.273
HE STILL BELIEVES
HE CAN USE HIS MONEY
TO SHUT PEOPLE UP.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.676
MELISSA, I'M NOT
GOING THERE, OKAY?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.044
DAD DID NOT PAY OFF ALI.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.347
WE WERE BOTH
LIED TO, SPENCE.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.951
THIS NECKLACE IS NOTHING
BUT HIS GUILT TALKING.

09:43.984 --> 09:46.286
YEAH, BUT BEING JASON'S
FATHER IS NOT THE SAME THING

09:46.319 --> 09:47.855
AS WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.658
I'M THINKING THAT HE HAS
A LOT TO COVER UP FOR?

09:50.691 --> 09:52.225
( footsteps )

09:52.259 --> 09:54.928
OH, YOU OPENED IT.

09:54.962 --> 09:57.164
I WANTED TO SEE
THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.067
IT'S-- IT'S JUST SO--

10:00.100 --> 10:04.137
SPEECHLESS. YOU SEE THAT?
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS GOING FOR.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.839
COME HERE.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.778
NOW, YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

10:10.811 --> 10:12.646
YOU'RE GONNA WEAR IT TO THE
DANCE TOMORROW NIGHT, OKAY?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.381
SURE. PROMISE.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.721
( crickets chirping )

10:25.726 --> 10:28.161
THANKS FOR MEETING ME HERE.

10:28.195 --> 10:29.763
I DON'T WANT
THESE CONVERSATIONS

10:29.797 --> 10:31.064
TO BE OVERHEARD
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.366
DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.703
A REQUEST.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.806
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.
I'VE TRIED TALKING TO HANNA.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.407
SHE'S NOT GIVING
ANYTHING UP.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.076
BUT HER PHONE WILL.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.312
YOU WANT HER PHONE.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.414
I NEED TO KNOW WHO
SHE'S BEEN TALKING TO.

10:47.447 --> 10:49.683
WHOM SHE'S BEEN TEXTING.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.351
WHOEVER GAVE HER THAT REPORT
IS IN HANNA'S WORLD.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.220
SHE'S PROBABLY
TALKED TO THEM,

10:53.253 --> 10:55.322
AND SHE'S DEFINITELY TALKED
TO HER FRIENDS ABOUT THEM.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.290
I DON'T THINK
I COULD DO THAT.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.326
WELL, THINK ABOUT
IT AGAIN, ASHLEY.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.028
'CAUSE IF WE WANT ANSWERS,

11:01.061 --> 11:04.131
THEN YOU NEED
TO GET ME THAT PHONE.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.402
SO, WHERE'S CALEB?

11:09.436 --> 11:10.938
HE'S IN MONTECITO
FOR THE WEEKEND,

11:10.971 --> 11:12.172
VISITING HIS PARENTS.

11:12.205 --> 11:13.340
TOUGH LIFE, HUH?

11:13.373 --> 11:14.708
YEAH.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.476
HAVE YOU HEARD
FROM "A" AGAIN?

11:16.509 --> 11:20.848
NO. GOOD THING TOO.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.016
THEY SAY THE PUNISHMENT'S
SUPPOSED TO FIT THE CRIME,

11:23.050 --> 11:24.952
BUT THIS COMMUNITY
SERVICE GIG,

11:24.985 --> 11:26.954
IS LIKE THE NINTH
CIRCLE OF HELL.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.488
OKAY, IT CAN'T
BE THAT BAD.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.158
TODAY I WENT FROM THE SOUP
KITCHEN TO THE SENIOR CENTER.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.425
OH.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.461
I'VE GONE FROM
SHOPPING CARTS TO WALKERS.

11:34.494 --> 11:36.396
WHAT'S NEXT?
DRIVING THE SHORT BUS?

11:36.429 --> 11:40.400
MONA, YOU ARE TERRIBLE.

11:40.433 --> 11:45.338
HEY, ISN'T THAT YOUR MOM?

11:47.841 --> 11:50.410
HANNA?

12:05.025 --> 12:07.527
HANNA--

12:07.560 --> 12:08.996
YOU'RE NOT, LIKE,
INTO HIM, ARE YOU?

12:09.029 --> 12:10.831
NO. GOD, NO.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.332
WELL THEN, WHAT?

12:12.365 --> 12:14.501
WHY WOULD YOU BE
IN A CAR WITH HIM?

12:14.534 --> 12:15.903
( sighs )

12:15.936 --> 12:18.772
I'M LOOKING FOR ANSWERS

12:18.806 --> 12:20.440
BECAUSE I CAN'T
GET ANY FROM YOU.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.042
WHAT KIND OF ANSWERS?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.411
THE OTHER DAY,
WHEN MONA WAS HERE,

12:24.444 --> 12:26.413
I SAW THAT SHREDDED
POLICE REPORT YOU HAD.

12:26.446 --> 12:27.848
YEAH. SO?

12:27.881 --> 12:30.417
SO WHERE DID
IT COME FROM?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.853
I DON'T KNOW.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.489
CLEARLY, SOMEONE IS TRYING
TO USE THAT TO HURT YOU,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.358
AND ME, SO I GAVE
IT TO WILDEN.

12:38.391 --> 12:41.228
LOOK, I DON'T LIKE HIM
ANY MORE THAN YOU DO.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.030
BUT IF HE CAN
KEEP YOU SAFE--

12:43.063 --> 12:46.967
NO, GIVING THAT REPORT TO
WILDEN IS THE OPPOSITE OF SAFE.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.168
MOM, IF THAT GETS OUT--

12:48.201 --> 12:49.436
IT'S ALREADY OUT.

12:49.469 --> 12:52.139
IT WAS ON OUR
KITCHEN COUNTER.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.908
WILDEN HAS JUST AS MUCH
AT STAKE AS WE DO.

12:54.942 --> 12:56.409
HE COULD LOSE HIS JOB,
AND, HANNA,

12:56.443 --> 12:58.245
YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW
WHAT'S BEST.

12:58.278 --> 13:00.580
YEAH? WELL IF YOU
WENT TO WILDEN,

13:00.613 --> 13:04.251
THEN NEITHER DO YOU.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.853
HANNA.

13:30.177 --> 13:31.879
HA!

13:31.912 --> 13:34.982
DIDN'T DAD TELL YOU TO START
BY SHAVING WITH THE GRAIN?

13:35.015 --> 13:37.484
I'M STILL TRYING
TO FIND THE GRAIN.

13:37.517 --> 13:40.520
I JUST THOUGHT I'D TRY
WHILE HE WAS AWAY, MAKING A--

13:40.553 --> 13:42.189
AND TAKING PICTURES.

13:42.222 --> 13:46.860
YEAH, NO EVENT TOO
SMALL TO COMMEMORATE.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.095
ARE YOU STILL
GOING TO THE DANCE?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.130
WHY?

13:50.163 --> 13:55.002
UH, WELL, GAVIN ASKED ME
TO LEND A HAND DEEJAYING, SO,

13:55.035 --> 13:56.403
I COULD USE A RIDE.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.339
YEAH, WELL,
BETTER FIND SOME BACKUP.

13:59.372 --> 14:02.575
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING THE WHOLE
FATHER/DAUGHTER THING LATELY.

14:02.609 --> 14:05.078
WELL, I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.

14:05.112 --> 14:06.579
YEAH? WHY?

14:06.613 --> 14:09.249
DAD STILL THINKS YOU'RE
SEEING HOLDEN, RIGHT?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.919
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
THAT I'M NOT?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.622
DID MOM TE--
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.391
I HEARD YOU GUYS WHEN YOU
CAME HOME LAST NIGHT.

14:18.425 --> 14:20.493
IF YOU DON'T GO, HE'S
JUST GONNA GET SUSPICIOUS

14:20.527 --> 14:22.262
THAT YOU'RE--
YOU'RE DUCKING OUT

14:22.295 --> 14:24.397
TO SEE YOUR SECRET
BOYFRIEND ALL OVER AGAIN.

14:26.466 --> 14:29.036
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

14:29.069 --> 14:31.104
SURE.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.472
YOU AND FITZ
BEING TOGETHER,

14:32.505 --> 14:36.209
IT'S CAUSED A LOT
OF PROBLEMS, RIGHT?

14:36.243 --> 14:39.012
NOT JUST WITH YOU,
BUT KIND OF WITH
EVERYBODY.

14:39.046 --> 14:41.648
I GUESS.

14:41.681 --> 14:45.986
I'M NOT BLAMING YOU,
I JUST-- I DON'T GET IT.

14:46.019 --> 14:47.620
YOU AND DAD RIGHT NOW,

14:47.654 --> 14:50.223
IT'S JUST THE LATEST IN
A WHOLE BUNCH OF MESSY FIGHTS

14:50.257 --> 14:51.959
AND LIES
AND BAD FEELINGS--

14:51.992 --> 14:53.927
MIKE.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.428
WHAT'S YOUR QUESTION?

14:55.462 --> 14:57.697
IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
IS SO MUCH TROUBLE,

14:57.730 --> 14:59.933
WHY NOT JUST LET IT GO?

14:59.967 --> 15:04.637
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT
THINGS WILL EVER WORK OUT.

15:04.671 --> 15:08.308
LOOK, WHEN YOU LOVE SOMEONE,

15:08.341 --> 15:11.511
IT'S WORTH FIGHTING FOR
NO MATTER WHAT THE ODDS.

15:19.052 --> 15:20.587
Emily:
DAD, IT'S SO GREAT
TO SEE YOU.

15:20.620 --> 15:23.223
I WISH MOM WAS HERE TOO.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.258
WELL, SHE MAY HAVE
FELT LIKE A THIRD WHEEL

15:25.292 --> 15:28.028
AT A FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.629
SHE'S GOT THAT CHARITY
RUN THIS WEEKEND.

15:29.662 --> 15:32.365
YEAH. I'M EXCITED TO CALL
AND FIND OUR HER TIMES.

15:32.399 --> 15:34.501
USUALLY, IT'S THE
OTHER WAY AROUND.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.304
YOUR MOM'S KICKING HERSELF FOR
MISSING YOUR SWIM TEAM FINALS.

15:37.337 --> 15:40.440
YEAH, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

15:40.473 --> 15:43.043
WELL, IT ACTUALLY KINDA WAS.

15:43.076 --> 15:46.046
WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE MAYA
IN THE STANDS CHEERING FOR YOU.

15:48.348 --> 15:52.052
THAT'S NOT A GOOD LOOK.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.753
WANNA TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:53.786 --> 15:58.291
MAYA'S GONE.

15:58.325 --> 16:01.361
I CAUGHT HER DOING
SOMETHING THAT COULD
HER IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.

16:01.394 --> 16:04.331
INSTEAD OF LISTENING,
I JUMPED DOWN HER THROAT.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.532
SHE SAID SHE
WAS GONNA CRASH

16:05.565 --> 16:10.037
WITH SOME FRIENDS
IN SAN FRANCISCO, SO.

16:10.070 --> 16:13.406
I GUESS THAT'S
WHERE SHE IS.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.542
I JUST WISH SHE'D CALL
OR TEXT ME OR SOMETHING

16:15.575 --> 16:17.144
SO I'D KNOW FOR SURE.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.046
HER PARENTS HAVE NO
IDEA WHERE SHE IS?

16:21.148 --> 16:23.416
WELL, I KNOW YOU WOULD
FEEL BETTER IF YOU HAD
MORE INFORMATION,

16:23.450 --> 16:28.155
BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE MAYA
WANTS TO STAY DISCONNECTED.

16:28.188 --> 16:30.357
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF WAYS
THAT SOMEONE YOUR AGE

16:30.390 --> 16:32.159
CAN MAKE IT TO CALIFORNIA
ON THEIR OWN.

16:32.192 --> 16:34.194
WE COULD CHECK
THE BUS STATION.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.130
IT'S CHEAP, IT'S A GREAT WAY
TO TRAVEL UNDER THE RADAR.

16:37.164 --> 16:40.300
HELL, I MADE IT
TO ALBUQUERQUE.

16:40.333 --> 16:42.635
YOU RAN AWAY?

16:42.669 --> 16:45.572
I PUT YOUR GRANDPARENTS
THROUGH HELL.

16:45.605 --> 16:48.541
I WAS, UH,
LOST IN HIGH SCHOOL.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.477
HOW LONG WERE YOU GONE FOR?

16:50.510 --> 16:52.212
OH, JUST A FEW DAYS.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.647
LONG ENOUGH TO SCARE 'EM.

16:54.681 --> 16:57.817
YEAH, WELL, IF THAT'S
WHAT MAYA INTENDED TO DO,

16:57.850 --> 17:00.587
IT'S DEFINITELY WORKING.

17:00.620 --> 17:03.523
HEY, COME ON.

17:03.556 --> 17:05.125
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AROUND TODAY, YEAH?

17:05.157 --> 17:07.227
SEE IF WE CAN PUT
YOUR MIND AT EASE.

17:07.260 --> 17:11.263
WHO KNOWS? MAYBE MAYA
DECIDES TO COME HOME FASTER

17:11.298 --> 17:14.032
IF SHE KNOWS THE PEOPLE WHO CARE
ABOUT HER ARE STILL LOOKING.

17:20.607 --> 17:24.644
HEY, YOU UP FOR
A LITTLE ROUND ROBIN?

17:24.676 --> 17:26.346
MEETING THE GIBSONS
AT THE CLUB.

17:26.378 --> 17:30.850
UM, I WOULD REALLY LOVE TO,
BUT I HAVE TO STUDY.

17:30.883 --> 17:33.720
OH.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.623
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, DO YOU?
THE NECKLACE?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.758
I SHOULD'VE LET YOU
PICK SOMETHING OUT.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.428
NO, DAD, I DO LIKE IT.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.496
I GET IT.
YOU NEED YOUR SPACE.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.366
I MISS HAVING YOU OUT THERE
ON THE COURT WITH ME, YOU KNOW?

17:46.399 --> 17:49.536
WE MAKE SUCH A GREAT TEAM.

17:51.671 --> 17:54.174
OKAY.

17:54.207 --> 17:57.610
OH, I MADE DINNER
RESERVATIONS AT GIANNI'S.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.246
I KNOW IT'S ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITES.

17:59.279 --> 18:00.680
7:00 GOOD?

18:00.713 --> 18:03.116
YEAH, 7:00 IS FINE.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.152
OKAY.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.287
WILL YOU BE GONE LONG?

18:07.320 --> 18:11.424
UM, FOR A COUPLE HOURS.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.379
( lock rattles )

19:44.517 --> 19:46.486
( door opens )

19:48.421 --> 19:51.524
Melissa:
DAD?

19:51.558 --> 19:53.493
OH, HEY.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.727
HEY.

19:54.761 --> 19:57.830
HE'S AT THE CLUB.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.632
I JUST NEEDED A STAMP.

19:59.666 --> 20:01.901
OH, I THINK I MIGHT ACTUALLY
HAVE A STAMP IN MY--

20:01.934 --> 20:05.672
OH. GOT ONE.

20:15.815 --> 20:19.552
Emily:
I'LL SEE IF ONE OF THE
TICKET AGENTS TALKED TO MAYA.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.988
WHO WAS WORKING
A COUPLE NIGHTS AGO?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.528
EXCUSE ME.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.996
SHE CAN HELP YOU
AT THE NEXT STATION.

20:30.029 --> 20:32.432
THE GUARD SAID THAT YOU WERE
WORKING A COUPLE NIGHTS AGO.

20:32.465 --> 20:33.566
I WAS.

20:33.600 --> 20:34.601
DO YOU REMEMBER
SEEING THIS GIRL?

20:34.634 --> 20:36.636
SORRY.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.538
IF YOU COULD JUST TELL ME.
SORRY, MISS.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.374
I ONLY HAVE 20 MINUTES
FOR LUNCH.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.543
WE'RE NOT GONNA
FIND ANYTHING HERE.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.545
HOLD ON A SECOND, SWEETIE.

20:45.578 --> 20:46.946
AFTERNOON, SIR.

20:46.979 --> 20:49.282
YOU COMMISSIONED?

20:49.316 --> 20:50.783
FORT HOOD, TEXAS.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.785
HONORABLE DISCHARGE, '75.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.287
HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

20:54.321 --> 20:56.389
MY DAUGHTER HAS GOT
SOME QUESTIONS.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.292
A FRIEND OF HERS IS LOST.
WANNA SEE IF WE CAN BRING
HER BACK HOME.

20:59.326 --> 21:02.295
CAN I SEE THAT
PICTURE AGAIN?

21:03.830 --> 21:06.299
I DID SEE YOUR FRIEND.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.700
BOUGHT A TICKET
TO SAN FRAN.

21:07.734 --> 21:09.336
THAT'S WHERE SHE WENT.

21:09.369 --> 21:10.970
WHERE SHE BOUGHT
HER TICKET TO.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.606
WHAT DO YOU MEAN EXACTLY?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.741
WELL, I SAW HER
TWICE THAT NIGHT.

21:14.774 --> 21:16.609
ONCE AT THE WINDOW,

21:16.643 --> 21:18.978
THEN ABOUT AN HOUR LATER,
I WAS CHECKING A LADY'S BAGS.

21:19.011 --> 21:20.713
I SAW HER STANDING OUTSIDE

21:20.747 --> 21:22.982
TALKING TO SOMEONE
IN A DARK COLORED CAR.

21:23.015 --> 21:24.651
BLUE, MAYBE BLACK.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.419
COULD YOU SEE WHO WAS DRIVING?

21:26.453 --> 21:29.656
NOT REALLY. I TURNED
MY BACK FOR A MINUTE
TO LOAD SOME BAGS.

21:29.689 --> 21:34.060
WHEN I LOOKED BACK,
BOTH YOUR FRIEND
AND THE CAR WERE GONE.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.528
DO YOU KNOW IF SHE
GOT ON THE BUS?

21:35.562 --> 21:37.397
CAN'T SAY FOR SURE.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.999
GREAT.
SHE COULD BE ANYWHERE.

21:40.032 --> 21:41.834
THANKS FOR YOUR
HELP, SIR.

21:41.868 --> 21:44.371
MY PLEASURE.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.647
THAT LOOKS NICE.

21:54.681 --> 21:57.049
OH, YOUR HOME.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.586
YEAH, YOU PICKING
SOMETHING FOR TONIGHT?

21:59.619 --> 22:03.490
YUP. TRYING TO DO MY BEST.

22:03.523 --> 22:05.057
DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

22:05.091 --> 22:07.460
I NEED LEAD TIME TO MAKE
SURE MY TIE MATCHES.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.364
DAD, WE DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT THIS YEAR.

22:11.398 --> 22:15.368
WHY? WHAT'S DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS YEAR?

22:19.439 --> 22:21.941
LISTEN, ARIA,
I KNOW THAT YOU AND I

22:21.974 --> 22:23.810
HAVE HAD OUR
PROBLEMS LATELY.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.878
BUT THIS IS--

22:25.912 --> 22:27.580
THIS IS THE
FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE,

22:27.614 --> 22:29.816
AND I NEED TO TAKE
MY LITTLE GIRL.

22:29.849 --> 22:33.853
SO, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK?

22:33.886 --> 22:36.122
NO, IT'S NOT.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.793
I'M JUST GONNA PICK
WHAT I'M GONNA WEAR.

22:51.438 --> 22:54.373
( vibrates )

23:04.817 --> 23:08.921
( beeps, rings out )

23:08.955 --> 23:11.658
Recorded voice:
 VOICE MAILBOX FULL.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.594
( hangs up )

23:20.600 --> 23:22.502
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

23:22.535 --> 23:23.570
OUT.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.972
HANNA. HANNA.

23:26.005 --> 23:29.976
YOU HAVE ONE LAST
CHANCE TO TELL ME ABOUT
THAT POLICE REPORT.

23:30.009 --> 23:31.444
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

23:31.478 --> 23:32.845
WHAT YOU WANT TO TELL ME.

23:32.879 --> 23:34.213
I'M ASKING YOU
FOR THE REST.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.883
WHO IT CAME FROM?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.452
AND WHY?

23:42.021 --> 23:45.458
( sighs )

23:45.492 --> 23:46.626
YOU NEED TO GIVE
ME YOUR PHONE.

23:46.659 --> 23:47.894
WHAT?

23:47.927 --> 23:49.696
IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GIVE ME ANY ANSWERS,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.964
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
LOOKING FOR THEM MYSELF.

23:51.998 --> 23:54.000
DID WILDEN ASK YOU TO--

23:54.033 --> 23:56.669
NO, THIS ISN'T ABOUT WILDEN,
THIS IS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

23:56.703 --> 23:57.937
I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU.

23:57.970 --> 24:00.640
GIVE IT TO ME.

24:00.673 --> 24:01.641
NO.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.643
NOW.

24:03.676 --> 24:07.079
HANNA. HANNA!

24:09.782 --> 24:12.652
I'M OUTTA HERE.

24:14.721 --> 24:17.757
( sighs )

24:20.693 --> 24:23.696
( party chatter )

24:23.730 --> 24:26.032
YOUR WEARING YOUR
DRESS UNIFORM.

24:26.065 --> 24:27.900
ISN'T THAT FOR SPECIAL
OCCASIONS?

24:27.934 --> 24:30.136
AND WHAT'S NOT
SPECIAL ABOUT TONIGHT?

24:30.169 --> 24:33.940
IT WOULD'VE BEEN MORE SPECIAL
IF I'D GOTTEN READY ON TIME.

24:33.973 --> 24:36.976
SORT OF GOT HUNG UP AT HOME.
MAYA CALLED.

24:37.009 --> 24:38.645
YOU TALKED TO HER.
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

24:38.678 --> 24:40.847
SHE DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE.

24:40.880 --> 24:42.682
I WANTED TO WAIT AND SEE
IF SHE'D CALL BACK.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.951
WELL, AT LEAST YOU
HEARD FROM HER.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.786
IT'S JUST SO FRUSTRATING.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.788
YOU MADE PLANS FOR
US TO HANG OUT,

24:48.821 --> 24:51.524
AND ALL I WANTED TO DO
WAS LOOK FOR MAYA.

24:51.558 --> 24:53.793
NOW I'M STARTING
TO REALIZE IT.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.028
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T
WANT TO BE FOUND.

24:56.062 --> 24:57.864
I JUST WISH I HADN'T
WASTED OUR TIME TOGETHER.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.866
HOW WE SPEND THE
TIME DOESN'T MATTER.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.734
I GET TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

25:01.768 --> 25:04.804
I DON'T WANT YOU FEELING
GUILTY ABOUT THAT.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.206
( laughs )

25:12.779 --> 25:15.615
EMMIE, I HAVE TO BE
TRUTHFUL WITH YOU.

25:18.084 --> 25:19.886
THIS MAY BE
THE LAST WEEKEND

25:19.919 --> 25:22.154
WE GET TO SPEND
TOGETHER FOR A WHILE.

25:22.188 --> 25:24.991
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

25:27.359 --> 25:29.996
THEY'RE SENDING YOU BACK.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.931
AFGHANISTAN.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.833
SIX MONTHS.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.802
DOES MOM KNOW?

25:35.835 --> 25:37.069
SHE DOES.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.805
PART OF THE REASON
WHY SHE STAYED AT HOME.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.273
TO PACK UP THE HOUSE.

25:41.307 --> 25:44.677
AND SHE WANTED TO GIVE US
SOME QUALITY TIME TOGETHER.

25:46.713 --> 25:48.681
WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

25:48.715 --> 25:51.117
I'M ON THE LAST
FLIGHT OUT TONIGHT.

25:51.150 --> 25:53.753
DEPLOY OUT OF TEXAS
TOMORROW MORNING.

25:59.726 --> 26:02.829
COME ON.

26:04.296 --> 26:07.800
* MARRIED WITH
A LACK OF VISION *

26:07.834 --> 26:12.772
* EVERYBODY WANTS
TO RULE THE *

26:12.805 --> 26:17.076
* SAY THAT YOU'LL NEVER NEVER
NEVER NEVER NEED IT *

26:17.109 --> 26:19.946
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.982
THANKS.

26:24.984 --> 26:27.920
HEY, LATER, LET'S MAKE SURE
THAT WE GET A PHOTOGRAPH, OKAY?

26:27.954 --> 26:30.757
OF COURSE.

26:30.790 --> 26:33.693
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER THE FIRST
TIME WE DANCED LIKE THIS.

26:33.726 --> 26:38.130
YOU WERE SO LITTLE,
YOU HAD TO STAND ON MY SHOES.

26:38.164 --> 26:42.234
YEAH, THAT WAS A REALLY
LONG TIME AGO, DAD.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.838
YEAH. I GUESS IT WAS.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.047
* THE SMELL OF YOUR SKIN

26:55.081 --> 26:59.285
* LINGERS ON ME NOW

27:01.187 --> 27:03.122
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO GET US
SOMETHING TO DRINK, OKAY?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.658
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
OKAY.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.931
HANNA, WHAT'S GOING ON?

27:11.964 --> 27:12.999
WHERE'S YOUR DRESS?

27:13.032 --> 27:14.366
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

27:14.400 --> 27:15.902
HOT ON THE "A" TRAIL.

27:15.935 --> 27:18.805
UM, WHAT DOES THAT
MEAN EXACTLY?

27:18.838 --> 27:21.207
IT MEANS SHE FOUND THE POLICE
REPORT THAT "A" SENT YOU.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.775
AND SHE THINKS
IT WAS SENT TO ME.

27:22.809 --> 27:23.910
SHE GAVE IT TO WILDEN.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.111
Spencer: WHY?

27:25.144 --> 27:26.779
BECAUSE SHE THINKS
IT'S A THREAT.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.247
IT IS.

27:28.280 --> 27:29.849
I DON'T KNOW, SHE'S JUST
TRYING TO KEEP US SAFE.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.083
YEAH, BUT WHY WILDEN?

27:31.117 --> 27:34.020
HANNA, NOW YOUR MOM
AND MY MOM

27:34.053 --> 27:35.688
ARE BOTH ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT "A".

27:35.722 --> 27:37.123
AND "A" REALLY
DOESN'T LIKE THAT.

27:37.156 --> 27:38.290
IF THEY TALK TO EACH OTHER--

27:38.324 --> 27:40.192
OR IF WILDEN COMES UP
WITH SOMETHING?

27:40.226 --> 27:42.161
WHAT IF THEY END UP LIKE--

27:42.194 --> 27:43.262
JU--

27:43.295 --> 27:46.899
UM, OKAY.

27:46.933 --> 27:48.701
WE NEED
A CREATIVE SOLUTION.

27:48.735 --> 27:53.005
WELL, I HAVE AN IDEA.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.910
OKAY, MONA.

27:57.944 --> 28:01.948
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE A REALLY BIG
LIE AND I'M TERRIBLE AT THAT.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.917
WHICH ONE OF YOU GIRLS
IS BEST AT HIDING THE TRUTH

28:04.951 --> 28:06.485
FROM SOMEONE WHO'S
CLOSE TO YOU?

28:06.518 --> 28:08.187
All: HER.

28:08.220 --> 28:11.290
WOW, REALLY?
THANKS, GUYS.

28:15.394 --> 28:18.197
OKAY, MONA, WHAT'S MY LIE?

28:21.768 --> 28:24.703
*

28:33.813 --> 28:36.849
DON'T FORGET TO SMILE.

28:38.384 --> 28:40.019
AH. THANK YOU.

28:46.358 --> 28:47.994
WHAT'S WRONG?

28:48.027 --> 28:49.829
SLOW DANCE
NOT YOUR SPEED?

28:49.862 --> 28:52.098
'CAUSE I CAN GET THE DJ TO
PUMP UP THE JAMS A LITTLE

28:52.131 --> 28:54.934
IF YOU WANT.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.135
NO, REALLY, COME ON.

28:56.168 --> 28:57.236
BUST AND MOVE WITH
YOUR OLD MAN.

28:57.269 --> 29:01.107
WHAT DO YOU SAY? HUH?

29:01.140 --> 29:05.211
SPENCE, I'M REALLY TRYING HERE.

29:05.244 --> 29:07.246
A LITTLE BIT TOO HARD.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.514
WAIT, WAIT, SPENCER.

29:08.547 --> 29:11.183
DAD, YOU KEPT A HUGE
SECRET FROM US.

29:11.217 --> 29:13.853
AND I DON'T WANT TO DO
THE SAME THING TO YOU.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.455
I WENT INTO YOUR STUDY TODAY
WHEN YOU WERE AT THE CLUB.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.258
AND YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU
DIDN'T PAY ALISON A CENT.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.292
BECAUSE I DIDN'T.

29:20.326 --> 29:21.460
WELL, I FOUND A CHECK STUB

29:21.493 --> 29:22.795
THAT WOULD SUGGEST
DIFFERENTLY.

29:22.829 --> 29:24.430
WHAT CHECK STUB?
WERE YOU IN MY DESK?

29:24.463 --> 29:25.998
THERE WAS NO DATE ON IT,

29:26.032 --> 29:27.033
BUT I KNOW IT WAS WRITTEN
AROUND THE TIME

29:27.066 --> 29:28.267
OF ALISON'S DISAPPEARANCE.

29:28.300 --> 29:31.103
SPENCER--
$15,000, DAD.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.139
EXACTLY THE AMOUNT THAT
ALI HAD STASHED AWAY.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.275
LOOK, I KNOW WE HAVE SOME
TRUST ISSUES RIGHT NOW.

29:36.308 --> 29:38.577
BUT THAT DIDN'T GIVE YOU
THE RIGHT TO GO INTO MY DESK.

29:38.610 --> 29:40.813
CAN WE NOT DISCUSS THIS HERE?

29:40.847 --> 29:42.882
I WANNA GO HOME.

29:49.355 --> 29:52.291
*

29:56.562 --> 30:00.199
HEY, JUST IN TIME.
IT'S ALMOST OUR TURN.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.868
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

30:01.901 --> 30:04.136
DO YOU CARE IF WE LEAVE
THE DANCE A LITTLE BIT EARLY?

30:04.170 --> 30:06.038
EARLY?
LIKE NOW?

30:06.072 --> 30:08.140
UM, HANNA REALLY NEEDS ME.

30:08.174 --> 30:11.010
I JUST SAW HANNA.
SHE LOOKED FINE.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.079
DAD, PLEASE.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.447
UM, CAN WE AT LEAST
GET A PHOTO FIRST?

30:15.481 --> 30:18.384
WE'VE GOT ONE FROM--
EVERY YEAR,
YOU AND YOUR LITTLE GIRL.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.320
I KNOW, BUT YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.156
I'M NOT YOUR
LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE.

30:27.593 --> 30:31.097
I'M SORRY. BUT I'M NOT.

30:57.389 --> 30:58.390
( gasps )

31:07.066 --> 31:08.935
TOBY?

31:20.312 --> 31:22.114
( sighs )

31:25.184 --> 31:27.653
REALLY AMAZING WHAT
THEY'VE DONE IN HERE.

31:27.686 --> 31:30.422
ALMOST FORGET
I'M IN A CAFETERIA.

31:30.456 --> 31:34.293
YEAH, IT'S PRETTY.

31:34.326 --> 31:38.297
DAD, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
RIGHT WHEN YOU GOT HERE?

31:38.330 --> 31:40.967
I COULDN'T, KIDDO.

31:41.000 --> 31:43.302
AS MUCH AS I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT MAYA,

31:43.335 --> 31:45.171
I COULD'VE HANDLED IT.

31:45.204 --> 31:47.539
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
CAN HANDLE IT.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.076
IT WAS MORE FOR ME.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.444
I JUST NEEDED
THIS WEEKEND.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.280
TO DANCE WITH YOU.

31:54.313 --> 31:58.184
* AND IMAGINE I'M
IN YOUR SIGHT *

31:58.217 --> 32:03.122
* SENDING WISHES
AND TAKING FLIGHT *

32:03.155 --> 32:08.094
* LOVERS WILL FIND
A WAY *

32:11.263 --> 32:13.065
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.134
OKAY.

32:15.167 --> 32:18.170
I KNOW ABOUT THAT
POLICE REPORT YOU HAVE

32:18.204 --> 32:20.672
AND I KNOW WHO
SENT IT TO HANNA.

32:20.706 --> 32:24.043
YOU DO?

32:24.076 --> 32:26.178
WHO?

32:26.212 --> 32:27.279
ME.

32:27.313 --> 32:30.416
YOU? WHY?

32:30.449 --> 32:32.451
( exhales )

32:32.484 --> 32:34.486
I'VE KNOWN FOR A WHILE NOW

32:34.520 --> 32:36.522
THAT HANNA'S BEEN
SHOPLIFTING AGAIN.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.490
I'M SORRY TO BE THE ONE
TO HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT.

32:38.524 --> 32:39.725
GO ON.

32:39.758 --> 32:42.061
WELL, HANNA WOULDN'T
LISTEN TO ME.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.496
TO ANY OF US WHEN
WE BEGGED HER TO STOP.

32:44.530 --> 32:48.334
AND I KNOW THAT SHE'S
BEEN CAUGHT BEFORE

32:48.367 --> 32:51.503
AND I--I WAS JUST AFRAID
THAT IF SHE GOT CAUGHT AGAIN,

32:51.537 --> 32:53.272
SHE COULD END UP IN JAIL.

32:53.305 --> 32:57.076
SO, I SENT HER THE REPORT
TO FRIGHTEN HER.

32:57.109 --> 32:59.711
TO TRY AND SCARE
HER STRAIGHT.

32:59.745 --> 33:01.380
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

33:01.413 --> 33:04.383
I MADE IT UP. LITERALLY.

33:04.416 --> 33:07.119
IT'S NICE TO KNOW
MY PHOTOSHOP CLASS

33:07.153 --> 33:09.221
FINALLY CAME IN HANDY.

33:11.423 --> 33:14.026
WELL, THAT'S QUITE A STORY.

33:14.060 --> 33:16.362
AND YOU'RE REALLY THE
ONLY PERSON INVOLVED?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.497
YUP.

33:18.530 --> 33:19.798
I'M "A".

33:19.831 --> 33:24.236
A FOR ANONYMOUS.
A FOR ARIA. A FOR--

33:24.270 --> 33:27.273
I GET IT.

33:30.209 --> 33:32.644
I'M-- I'M SO SORRY,
MRS. MARIN.

33:32.678 --> 33:35.514
I APPRECIATE YOU
SPEAKING WITH ME, ARIA.

33:35.547 --> 33:40.219
YEAH, WELL, IF THERE'S ANYTHING
ELSE YOU NEED ME TO DO,

33:40.252 --> 33:41.487
OR IF THERE'S--

33:41.520 --> 33:44.656
I THINK I'LL TAKE
IT FROM HERE.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.701
WHAT ELSE DID
YOU TOUCH IN HERE?

33:55.734 --> 33:57.536
NOTHING.
SPENCER, YOU SAID

33:57.569 --> 33:59.671
YOU WERE IN HERE TODAY.
DID YOU OPEN THIS DRAWER?

33:59.705 --> 34:01.540
NO, IT WAS LOCKED.

34:01.573 --> 34:04.843
( sighs )

34:04.876 --> 34:06.412
DAD?

34:06.445 --> 34:08.580
( phone rings out )

34:08.614 --> 34:10.181
YES, HI. I NEED TO
REPORT A BREAK IN.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.684
THE HOUSE WAS LOCKED UP
TIGHT WHEN WE LEFT,

34:12.717 --> 34:16.388
BUT THERE'S A GUN
MISSING FROM MY DESK.

34:18.257 --> 34:20.292
YES. NO, UM--

34:20.326 --> 34:21.592
NOTHING ELSE APPEARS
TO BE STOLEN.

34:21.627 --> 34:23.695
JUST THE GUN.

35:02.768 --> 35:04.303
HEY.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.572
HEY.

35:06.605 --> 35:07.873
YOU HAVE A GOOD
TIME TONIGHT?

35:07.906 --> 35:10.176
CONSIDERING IT WAS
A FATHER/DAUGHTER DANCE.

35:10.209 --> 35:13.512
YEAH. YEAH.
ABSOLUTELY.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.281
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

35:15.314 --> 35:18.617
HAVE YOU, UM, HAVE YOU
SEEN YOUR SISTER?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.652
NOT YET.

35:20.686 --> 35:24.556
OKAY. WELL, GOODNIGHT.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.858
DAD?

35:26.892 --> 35:30.296
DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU'VE
BEEN TOO HARD ON ARIA?

35:30.329 --> 35:32.698
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU DO.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.933
I KNOW THAT SHE DIDN'T
TELL YOU THE TRUTH

35:34.966 --> 35:37.803
ABOUT HER AND MR. FITZ,
BUT DID SHE TELL YOU WHY?

35:37.836 --> 35:40.472
NO.

35:40.506 --> 35:44.310
MAYBE BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T ASK.

36:03.629 --> 36:07.333
Mr. Hastings on phone:
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
SEE YOU SOON.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.336
PATROL CAR WILL
BE HERE SHORTLY.

36:17.543 --> 36:20.912
I GAVE THOSE PICTURES
TO A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.914
FOR REFERENCE.

36:22.948 --> 36:24.983
YOU HAD HER FOLLOWED.

36:25.016 --> 36:28.454
THE CHECK STUB YOU FOUND
TODAY, WRITTEN TO CASH?

36:28.487 --> 36:30.422
BUT I THOUGHT THAT--

36:30.456 --> 36:34.293
I KNOW WHAT YOU THOUGHT.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.428
YOU THOUGHT I PAID
ALISON'S BLACKMAIL.

36:36.462 --> 36:39.565
AND I LIED TO YOU.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.833
SPENCER, I HIRED
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR

36:41.867 --> 36:43.602
TO LOOK INTO
HER DISAPPEARANCE.

36:43.635 --> 36:46.538
WHY WOULD YOU SPEND
THAT MUCH MONEY?

36:46.572 --> 36:48.407
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN CARE?

36:48.440 --> 36:51.243
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT
TO ME MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

36:51.277 --> 36:55.013
YOU CHANGED THAT WILL
TO GIVE JASON AN ALIBI.

36:55.046 --> 36:56.948
WELL, IT'S YOU
PROTECTING HIM.

36:56.982 --> 37:00.352
DO YOU THINK JASON REALLY
HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT?

37:00.386 --> 37:04.523
NO, SPENCER.
NOT JASON.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.892
I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

37:06.925 --> 37:09.761
WHY?

37:09.795 --> 37:12.464
MELISSA WAS HARASSING
ALISON.

37:12.498 --> 37:15.467
SENDING HER TEXTS
AND THREATS.

37:15.501 --> 37:17.403
AND THEN YOUR FRIEND
DISAPPEARED.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.605
YOU DON'T THINK
THAT MELISSA--

37:19.638 --> 37:21.673
I JUST NEEDED
PIECE OF MIND.

37:21.707 --> 37:23.942
AND I WAS WILLING
TO PAY FOR ANSWERS.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.011
( knocking )

37:26.044 --> 37:28.680
THAT'S THE POLICE.

37:28.714 --> 37:31.983
I THINK YOU BETTER
GO UPSTAIRS.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.829
( police radio chatter )

37:45.831 --> 37:47.533
SPENCER.
( gasps )

37:47.566 --> 37:49.568
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO SCARE YOU.

37:49.601 --> 37:51.937
WHY ARE THE COPS HERE?
I SAW DAD TALKING
TO THEM OUTSIDE?

37:51.970 --> 37:54.973
DAD'S GUN IS MISSING.

37:55.006 --> 37:57.443
HE THINKS THAT
SOMEBODY BROKE IN.

37:57.476 --> 38:00.446
YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANYBODY,
DID YOU?

38:00.479 --> 38:03.582
NO. I FELL ASLEEP WATCHING
A SHOW IN THE BARN.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.451
LIGHTS WOKE ME UP
A FEW MINUTES AGO.

38:05.484 --> 38:08.587
I THOUGHT THAT THE TV
OUTSIDE IS BROKEN.

38:08.620 --> 38:10.756
I DON'T KNOW, I WAS
WATCHING IT ON MY LAPTOP.

38:10.789 --> 38:14.025
LISTEN, I GOTTA GO BACK
INTO THE CITY TONIGHT.

38:14.059 --> 38:16.027
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE TALKED ABOUT;

38:16.061 --> 38:18.330
JASON, DAD, THE BLACKMAIL;

38:18.364 --> 38:20.031
I DON'T THINK
I CAN STAY HERE.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.968
I SHOULD GET
ON THE ROAD.

38:23.001 --> 38:26.672
BUT, LISTEN, SPENCER,

38:26.705 --> 38:29.508
IF THINGS START GETTING
EVEN WEIRDER AROUND HERE,

38:29.541 --> 38:32.043
YOU CAN ALWAYS COME
STAY WITH ME.

38:32.077 --> 38:35.414
I WANT YOU TO KNOW,
I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE, OKAY?

38:35.447 --> 38:37.082
OKAY.

38:37.115 --> 38:39.451
BYE.
BYE.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.362
Mrs. Marin :
I DIDN'T BUY IT.

38:50.396 --> 38:54.366
I APPRECIATE THAT, BUT THE FACT
THAT ARIA WOULD MAKE THIS UP.

38:54.400 --> 38:56.602
THEY'RE ALL MAKING THINGS UP.

38:56.635 --> 38:58.904
HIDING SOMETHING OR SOMEONE.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.972
WHOEVER THIS "A" PERSON IS

39:01.006 --> 39:02.941
HAS GOT THEM COMPLETELY
TERRIFIED.

39:02.974 --> 39:05.744
WHEN I SAW THAT POLICE
REPORT, I WAS SCARED TOO.

39:05.777 --> 39:10.015
ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHEN
BYRON AND I WERE SPLIT UP,

39:10.048 --> 39:13.151
THIS "A" SENT
SOMETHING TO US TOO.

39:13.184 --> 39:16.488
THEY KNEW THINGS
ABOUT OUR FAMILY.

39:16.522 --> 39:17.789
WHAT DID YOU DO?

39:17.823 --> 39:20.392
NOTHING, I MEAN,
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

39:20.426 --> 39:23.061
I DO, I GOT
THE POLICE INVOLVED.

39:23.094 --> 39:27.032
I'M NOT SO SURE
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.835
"A" KNOWS THINGS ABOUT ARIA
THAT COULD HURT HER.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.438
THIS HAS GONE ON
FOR FAR TOO LONG.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.774
WE OWE IT TO OURSELVES AND OUR
DAUGHTERS TO GET SOME ANSWERS.

39:46.618 --> 39:47.853
HEY.

39:47.886 --> 39:49.054
HEY.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.522
DID MY MOM BUY IT?

39:50.556 --> 39:52.924
I HAVE NO IDEA.

39:52.958 --> 39:54.426
DO YOU FEEL GUILTY?

39:54.460 --> 39:56.562
NO. YES.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.796
I DON'T KNOW.

39:57.829 --> 40:00.031
ALWAYS A GOOD SIGN.

40:00.065 --> 40:02.534
( phone rings )

40:02.568 --> 40:03.902
ARIA, WHAT'S WRONG?

40:03.935 --> 40:06.104
IT'S JONAH.

40:06.137 --> 40:08.073
WELL, ANSWER IT.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.747
HELLO?

40:17.115 --> 40:19.084
Aria: WAIT, SPENCE.
STOP HERE.

40:19.117 --> 40:22.521
I THINK THIS IS THE BLOCK.

40:25.924 --> 40:28.560
WELCOME TO BROOKHAVEN.

40:28.594 --> 40:31.196
WHAT DID JONAH SAY
TO YOU EXACTLY?

40:31.229 --> 40:34.132
THAT VIVIAN DARKBLOOM'S
FRIEND, ALISON,

40:34.165 --> 40:36.768
WAS RECEIVING TEXTS FROM
MORE THAN ONE NUMBER.

40:36.802 --> 40:38.236
WAIT, SO DOES
THIS MEAN THAT

40:38.269 --> 40:40.539
MELISSA WAS TELLING
SPENCER THE TRUTH?

40:40.572 --> 40:44.476
JUST MEANS THAT SHE'S GETTING
TEXTS FROM MORE THAN ONE NUMBER.

40:44.510 --> 40:47.045
SO THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE.
LIKE THE REAL "A".

40:47.078 --> 40:50.782
SPENCER, YOU WERE RIGHT.

40:50.816 --> 40:52.017
WHERE EXACTLY
ARE WE HEADED?

40:52.050 --> 40:55.554
I DON'T KNOW.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.256
JONAH SAID HE COULDN'T FIND
A SPECIFIC ADDRESS OR WHERE
THE TEXTS WERE COMING FROM,

40:58.289 --> 41:00.726
BUT THAT THEY ORIGINATED
SOMEWHERE

41:00.759 --> 41:02.594
IN A BLOCK RADIUS FROM HERE.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.796
DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING FOR?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.732
WELL, I'M LOOKING
FOR A NEW PHONE.

41:08.734 --> 41:12.003
GUYS.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.142
MY GOD.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.115
THOSE LOOK EXACTLY LIKE
THOSE CREEPY CHUCKY DOLLS

41:24.149 --> 41:27.118
THAT "A" SENT US.

41:27.152 --> 41:29.755
I'M FREEZING.

41:29.788 --> 41:32.123
I'VE GOT SOMETHING
IN THE BACK OF MY CAR.

41:32.157 --> 41:34.960
THANKS.

41:37.195 --> 41:40.165
I USED TO LIKE DOLLS.

41:40.198 --> 41:42.300
I'M OVER IT.

41:42.333 --> 41:43.735
ME TOO.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.906
( car alarm beeps )

42:04.856 --> 42:07.793
VIVIAN?

42:23.642 --> 42:23.709
( coins clank )
