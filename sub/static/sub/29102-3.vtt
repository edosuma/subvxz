WEBVTT

01:22.332 --> 01:24.542
It's bold. I'll give her that.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.711
-Boldly stupid.
Everybody out!

01:35.220 --> 01:37.138
Did I stutter? Get out.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.723
Go on, out!

01:39.516 --> 01:41.976
You won't get to go home,
but you can't stay here.

01:42.936 --> 01:45.146
Reznikov, I said move your ass.

01:46.606 --> 01:49.818
Put one foot
in front of the other

01:50.318 --> 01:51.736
and step the fuck out.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.833
-Let's go, Cathy. Time to get up.

02:14.676 --> 02:19.472
Oh, looks like
Chatty Cathy ain't so chatty no more, huh?

02:22.809 --> 02:25.478
Where you taking us

02:26.020 --> 02:28.231
How do we know this ain't
another one of your sick games?

02:28.314 --> 02:31.317
Relax. The SHU is closing down.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.195
Why?
-New sheriff in town.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.905
What happened to the old sheriff?

02:35.989 --> 02:38.658
-I need to push it all the way in.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.036
Goddamn motherfuck!

02:42.954 --> 02:44.247
Ah!

02:45.748 --> 02:46.875
All done.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.336
So is this what you pictured
when we started talking babymaking?

02:50.420 --> 02:54.132
Well, you weren't not bent over
a kitchen island, ass up.

02:54.716 --> 02:58.261
You want me to talk to your body for you?
Give it encouragement?

02:58.803 --> 03:01.472
Maybe massage the area, huh?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.600
Joe, I'm not getting pregnant
through my ass cheek.

03:03.683 --> 03:08.521
I figure it's never too early to show
the kid who's good cop around here.

03:09.105 --> 03:11.774
So that would make me bad cop?

03:11.858 --> 03:15.361
Mmm. Make you... firm cop.

03:15.445 --> 03:19.032
Because I'm cold
and heartless.

03:19.115 --> 03:22.660
-Well, you are the new "ice" queen.
-Hilarious.

03:22.744 --> 03:24.204
Why are we even doing this

03:24.287 --> 03:26.289
if you don't think I'm gonna be
a good mother

03:26.748 --> 03:30.835
Babe, I am balls deep
in medical science for you.

03:31.169 --> 03:35.131
You think I would be poking
that gorgeous ass with needles

03:35.673 --> 03:38.009
if I didn't think you were gonna be
an amazing mother?

03:42.388 --> 03:44.974
Come on. Safe

03:46.059 --> 03:47.018
Hmm?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.688
What's this all about Oh, gross. I hate when you try
and predict my feelings, but...

03:54.400 --> 03:55.401
yeah.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.447
Mmm. Maybe what you need
is a Joe Caputo pep talk.

03:59.530 --> 04:04.285
Oh, please. Save it for
your 12-year-old mentee who stole my job.

04:05.161 --> 04:06.663
To be fair, you got fired.

04:06.746 --> 04:08.915
And she's 26.

04:08.998 --> 04:10.583
Not helping!

04:22.345 --> 04:25.306
-CO Hopper, good morning.

04:25.390 --> 04:26.808
Ad Seg's already at capacity,

04:26.891 --> 04:29.227
and your first day on the job,
you're closing down the SHU?

04:29.310 --> 04:32.480
That is right. We will no longer
be using solitary confinement

04:32.563 --> 04:33.815
as a means of discipline.

04:33.898 --> 04:38.403
Listen. Over and over, studies conclude
that it's cruel and ineffective,

04:38.486 --> 04:41.197
and it results in memory loss,
suicidal tendencies--

04:41.281 --> 04:43.032
Tamika, we need a means of discipline.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.535
All right? We need the threat
of a means of discipline.

04:45.618 --> 04:48.121
And incentive programs
motivate good behavior

04:48.204 --> 04:49.872
far more than fear of punishment.

04:50.999 --> 04:54.168
Well, if we're not punishing them,
then what the hell is the point of prison?

04:54.419 --> 04:57.547
Rehabilitation. Or at least it should be.

04:57.630 --> 04:59.215
Perfect. Perfect.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.218
So why don't we give them gold stars
and nut

05:02.302 --> 05:04.345
If that's actually a suggestion, Hopper,

05:04.429 --> 05:06.681
you're welcome to add it
to my suggestion box.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.688
You wanna know what I think?
I think this is a move.

05:14.230 --> 05:18.151
I think it's your way of justifying
why they gave you this job.

05:18.526 --> 05:22.780
Excuse me, they didn't give me this job.
I got this job.

05:23.614 --> 05:25.074
Yeah, let's go with that.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.577
Not that I have to list my résumé to you,

05:27.660 --> 05:30.747
but I've been taking prison management
courses for months now without you--

05:30.830 --> 05:33.833
Oh, come on, Tamika! You really think
they looked at your night school classes

05:33.916 --> 05:36.419
and thought, "Wow, she's so qualified"?

05:36.502 --> 05:41.549
I got years on you, Tamika. Years!
Years of real-life experience.

05:41.632 --> 05:44.052
We all know you got this job because...

05:48.181 --> 05:50.350
Because you tick the right boxes.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.771
What? You think I'm some sort
of diversity quota hire?

05:55.396 --> 05:56.397
You don't?

06:08.117 --> 06:11.621
Federal funding for detention centers
like ours is up 20%.

06:11.704 --> 06:13.247
More ICE agents on the streets,

06:13.331 --> 06:16.834
plus a growing list of deportable offenses
means our beds stay full.

06:16.918 --> 06:19.087
Then we ship 'em out,
we bring in even more.

06:19.670 --> 06:23.132
PolyCon charges $150 per day per detainee,

06:23.216 --> 06:27.220
which means stocks rise,
people feel safer, everybody's happy.

06:27.303 --> 06:30.264
This is your new office, by the way.
I got you a Nespresso.

06:33.351 --> 06:34.811
What's the deal here, Linda?

06:35.478 --> 06:38.106
You're treating this gig
like it's a reward,

06:38.189 --> 06:41.317
and I can't help feeling
it's more of a punishment.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.819
Mm, why's that?

06:43.111 --> 06:47.407
Maybe because you gave my Max job
to an unqualified child?

06:49.409 --> 06:52.870
You say unqualified,
I say differently qualified.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.290
Tamika is the right face for the moment.

06:56.874 --> 06:58.793
You got a diversity grant, didn't you?

06:59.836 --> 07:01.462
It was huge.

07:02.505 --> 07:06.509
And win-win. I mean, I can't think
of a person more suited to run this place.

07:06.592 --> 07:08.970
You obviously don't care
what people think,

07:09.053 --> 07:11.472
and you're very unyielding.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.643
-Hmm, yeah. I was gonna say "warden,"

07:15.726 --> 07:17.895
but if that's the title you want,
we will make it work.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.856
We're gonna get you a little plaque.

07:20.481 --> 07:21.899
And this is your queendom.

07:23.693 --> 07:24.527
Thank you.

07:28.990 --> 07:29.991
Here they are.

07:30.867 --> 07:31.701
It's so quiet.

07:33.786 --> 07:36.789
They are much more docile,
compared to Max.

07:37.790 --> 07:41.377
Our red uniforms are for Level Two,
people with felony convictions, etcetera.

07:41.461 --> 07:44.839
Orange are our Level Ones,
our non-criminals.

07:44.922 --> 07:47.175
So they're in orange,
but they're not criminals?

07:47.258 --> 07:51.220
Well, they are criminals.
They're here, right?

07:51.512 --> 07:54.474
-They came to our country illegally.
-That's exactly right, Carlos.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.810
Carlos Litvack,
Natalie Figueroa, our new warden.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.938
Mr. Litvack is head of ICE
here at PolyCon Detention.

08:01.022 --> 08:03.566
ICE handles the processing,
the legal, the deportation.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.902
And PolyCon handles
the housing and the feeding.

08:08.070 --> 08:10.907
Cute, right?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.576
Flew in here a few days ago.

08:13.910 --> 08:17.038
Keeps the ladies entertained,
so we, uh, decided not to deport it.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
Do any of them speak English?

08:20.583 --> 08:24.962
Some, though most favor <i>Español.</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:30.510
Majority are from Mexico, followed by
El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala.

08:30.593 --> 08:31.969
Then we have your others.

08:32.053 --> 08:36.349
Your, uh, Haitians, your Jamaicans,
general Africans.

08:36.432 --> 08:39.769
Of course, there's your Asian nerds,
your cool Asians.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.187
But beware of the Plastics.

08:43.064 --> 08:44.106
That was a <i>Mean Girls</i> joke.

08:44.690 --> 08:48.236
So it's like the <i>It's a Small World</i> ride,

08:48.319 --> 08:53.783
but minus the joy and the singing.
And the line is just as long.

08:53.866 --> 08:56.994
Some do-gooder lawyer-advocate types
told the detainees

08:57.078 --> 08:59.539
who were working in the kitchen
that they don't get paid

08:59.622 --> 09:02.041
and it doesn't help their case,
so they quit.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.335
Looks like you have your first task.

09:04.877 --> 09:08.256
Luckily, America's cheapest labor force
is just down the hill.

09:19.225 --> 09:23.646
This is so unfair!
This shit should be legit a crime.

09:24.855 --> 09:26.566
To have a dick like that.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.405
He had a Make-A-Wish dick,
and he wanted to take me to LA.

09:33.072 --> 09:38.953
I could've been a wifey
or a trophy wife or a <i>Real Housewife.</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:43.958
All I ever wanted to be was anything
with the word "wife" in it, you know?

09:44.917 --> 09:48.212
But no! I had to say no.

09:48.296 --> 09:53.217
And go to that stupid fucking Indigo club
and get scooped up with all these people.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.428
-No offense.
-None taken.

09:55.511 --> 09:58.889
What I don't understand is how
you even got into that club without ID.

10:01.058 --> 10:05.354
Hello? Look at me.
I don't need an ID to get into places.

10:05.896 --> 10:07.398
That's kinda like my thing.

10:07.481 --> 10:11.485
She kinda looks like that girl from <i>Glee</i>
but with sharper lines, you know?

10:12.069 --> 10:14.280
You know how hard it is
to get an ID after prison?

10:14.363 --> 10:17.241
-Sorry, I'm not a criminal.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.036
People like you are the reason
this is so hard for the rest of us.

10:20.119 --> 10:24.040
Bitch, I was born here.
I committed my crime legally.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.002
Ugh!

10:28.085 --> 10:29.587
Thank God you're in here.

10:30.588 --> 10:32.965
You know what I mean. This shit's brutal.

10:34.008 --> 10:38.971
I need to get in touch with someone
so that I can prove that I was born here.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.101
-I'm gonna ask for my phone call.
-You don't get a phone call.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.563
But there are phones right there.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.357
You don't get a free call.

10:50.232 --> 10:53.444
You gotta pay to set up an account,
and you gotta pay per minute.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.488
Okay, well, fuck that.

10:55.571 --> 10:58.282
When I get assigned my lawyer,
that's the first thing I'm gonna do.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.784
You don't get a lawyer.

11:00.910 --> 11:03.663
What? This is America.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.206
Not in here.

11:06.457 --> 11:10.127
It looks like a prison,
it smells like a prison,

11:10.211 --> 11:11.754
but it's not a prison.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.631
It's worse.

11:14.507 --> 11:19.303
Okay, I get that you're all Sally Sadface
because you're an illegal and everything,

11:19.387 --> 11:20.513
but that's just not me.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.140
I'm not an illegal.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.894
Sorry.
"Undocumented" or whatever.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.979
But if we work together,

11:29.063 --> 11:31.524
we can get in touch
with someone on the outside.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.193
Oh, wait, what about your boyfriend?

11:34.985 --> 11:36.153
It's over.

11:40.741 --> 11:43.494
<i>♪ We're all gonna die! ♪ </i>

11:45.329 --> 11:49.667
<i>♪ Now! ♪ </i>

11:54.880 --> 11:56.549
Listen up, <i>arrimados!</i>

11:56.924 --> 11:59.218
Before the police come,

11:59.301 --> 12:01.804
let's not forget why we came here tonight.

12:01.887 --> 12:06.142
This party may be illegal,
but that woman right there is not!

12:12.732 --> 12:17.695
Diablo, Mr. Sexy Romantic,
made us throw you this party.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.033
Congratulations on the green card, Blanca!

12:26.746 --> 12:28.372
Tell us how it feels.

12:29.999 --> 12:30.833
Really?

12:35.880 --> 12:36.797
Um...

12:38.048 --> 12:41.427
Well, it feels...

12:42.052 --> 12:45.723
Very good!

12:48.684 --> 12:51.187
And, like, a relief.

12:52.104 --> 12:55.483
And I know
this is a bit ridiculous, but...

12:55.566 --> 12:57.735
back in Santo Domingo,

12:57.818 --> 12:59.779
my mom and dad would argue a lot...

12:59.862 --> 13:03.240
and our place was tiny, we had two rooms,
there was nowhere to go.

13:03.324 --> 13:09.413
And I remember that song from the show,
<i>Perfect Strangers.</i>

13:11.415 --> 13:13.334
You know, with Balki and Larry?

13:13.918 --> 13:20.216
And Balki would have that
"America or Burst" sign, and I thought,

13:21.342 --> 13:28.057
"Wow, that country looks amazing.
Anything is possible there."

13:28.390 --> 13:30.226
And now I'm here.

13:30.309 --> 13:34.021
All I had to do was change
a bunch of adult diapers...

13:35.606 --> 13:40.027
fill out all the paperwork,
wait 12 years, and then...

13:40.986 --> 13:43.113
Welcome to America!

13:50.329 --> 13:53.457
But none of that matters.

13:53.541 --> 13:56.126
I love this country...

13:56.377 --> 13:58.879
because it gave me Diablo.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.423
Aw!
Whoa!

14:01.507 --> 14:03.634
Say something less fucking corny!

14:03.717 --> 14:05.553
Shut up, buttface!

14:09.807 --> 14:11.100
I love you.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.145
Wait, wait, wait.
You love me?

14:15.729 --> 14:18.399
Yeah, I do.

14:23.904 --> 14:26.073
Baby, I love you, too.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.950
I've been wanting to tell you
for so long,

14:28.033 --> 14:30.035
but you're so intimidating.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.204
And now that you've said it,

14:32.288 --> 14:33.706
I can say it.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.542
Baby, I love you so much.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.503
You make me so horny
when you're this cheesy.

14:54.143 --> 14:57.855
Dude, you've got to stop
taking other people's puddings.

14:58.439 --> 15:03.152
Why? There is a long history
in this country of pudding taking,

15:03.235 --> 15:06.363
and it divides along chocolate
and vanilla lines.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.619
Also, butterscotch. That's the Natives.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.954
And that's why I...

15:15.039 --> 15:16.832
God damn it!
-...eat this pudding.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.417
All right, listen.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.129
All it's doing at this point
is pissing off the senior citizens.

15:22.212 --> 15:23.589
Let me ask you a question.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.550
What is it you really want?

15:27.051 --> 15:28.093
Ice cream. And justice.

15:32.181 --> 15:37.937
It's not fair that because Cindy lied,
Taystee has to be in prison now forever?

15:38.687 --> 15:41.148
For ever ever? Yes.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.733
And it can't even be fixed,

15:42.816 --> 15:45.235
because they won't even be
in the same room together.

15:45.319 --> 15:49.406
Unless I can get them
in the same room together.

15:49.490 --> 15:50.449
Wait. But they hate each other.

15:50.532 --> 15:56.497
Unless I can get two people
who hate each other in the same room.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.333
But why would two people
who hate each other be in the same...

15:59.416 --> 16:01.043
Unless... No.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.212
Well, they could...
No, that will never work.

16:03.295 --> 16:09.969
We gotta come up with a real, practical,
real-world example for this.

16:10.678 --> 16:14.306
-I got it! I got it. I got it.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.101
<i>The Parent Trap.</i>

16:17.184 --> 16:20.062
Ooh. Like when you tell people
that you're pregnant,

16:20.145 --> 16:23.899
and then your friend's stepdad gives you
money for an abortion you don't need?

16:25.317 --> 16:26.819
I never saw the remake.

16:30.906 --> 16:32.908
Piper, you're amazing.

16:32.992 --> 16:38.288
All I did was look up
"DIY sensory activities budget."

16:38.372 --> 16:40.165
I can send you all links, if you'd like?

16:40.457 --> 16:43.043
Please don't.
I can't research baby shit anymore.

16:43.127 --> 16:46.338
Yesterday, I went online
to buy a baby spoon, and six hours later,
I'm in a Google deep-dive

16:49.717 --> 16:52.094
about how leaching plastics
are gonna kill us all.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.304
So can we talk about anything else?
Please.  Okay. All right. All right.
Piper, you're up.

16:56.807 --> 16:59.059
How'd the sexy pics go over
with your wife?

16:59.143 --> 17:00.602
Oh, yes.
-Good!

17:01.562 --> 17:03.147
Great. She loved 'em.

17:03.480 --> 17:07.317
It's amazing how a little nip can bridge
the gap between time and space.

17:07.693 --> 17:10.988
-Enjoy those while those last.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.614
Nothing doesn't get ruined.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.658
Oh, my God. I'm gonna pee myself.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.036
FYI, that gets ruined the most.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.037
Oh!

17:18.454 --> 17:21.040
Uh, I can hold her
while you go to the bathroom.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.710
Are you sure?
I haven't day-peed alone in a month!

17:25.377 --> 17:27.087
Thank you. Thank you.

17:31.133 --> 17:34.678
-Uh, go. I can keep an eye.
All right, then.

17:34.762 --> 17:35.929
Pass the baby.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.437
Ms. Chapman.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
Oh, what's going on here?

17:47.691 --> 17:49.151
Are we baking some babies?

17:55.199 --> 17:57.951
You see that? Vause is dealing.

17:59.620 --> 18:04.124
Doubt it. With the shit going down lately?
Her dumb ass is smarter than that.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.127
Probably gunnin' for some curry love.

18:07.961 --> 18:11.298
No, I saw something.
I'm gonna check it out.

18:19.598 --> 18:23.352
What are you doing?

18:26.897 --> 18:29.775
Vause, I know what you're up to.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.486
You wanna save yourself some trouble?

18:32.569 --> 18:35.614
Tell me where you're getting
the drugs from. Who's your source?

18:37.991 --> 18:39.618
-Or...

18:40.577 --> 18:42.871
I'll have 'em haul your ass down
to solitary.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.873
-Okay. All right, all right. Yeah.
-Yeah.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.210
Let's chill, everybody.
New warden closed the SHU,

18:48.293 --> 18:51.880
plus there's no way for us to know
what we didn't actually see.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.091
Yeah. It was a bloody tampon.

18:54.174 --> 18:56.802
See? Just a tamp.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.639
You think you've got this place
all figured out, huh?

19:00.722 --> 19:03.475
Well, I've got a new warden to impress,
so from now on,

19:03.559 --> 19:05.769
you're getting nothing
in or out of this cell.

19:05.853 --> 19:08.856
Whoever you're selling for,
better let 'em know you're burnt.

19:09.231 --> 19:13.694
-Exactly.
-Also, you should never flush tampons.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.362
The whole pipe will back up on you.

19:32.171 --> 19:37.342
Hi, T! It's Suzanne.
And you are courageously invited to the...

19:37.426 --> 19:41.138
-...library for a meeting of the...

19:41.513 --> 19:43.849
-Uh, the...
-Give me that.

19:47.269 --> 19:51.690
First of all, this don't say
"courageously," it says "cordially."

19:53.233 --> 19:55.611
And what's Suzanne want me
in the library for, anyway?

19:57.112 --> 19:59.239
I don't know. Maybe she misses you.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.036
I mean, if you ask me, I don't get it.
Was your friendship even that great?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.914
Because in my experience,

20:06.997 --> 20:10.459
the good memories from the past are
never as good as we remember them,

20:10.542 --> 20:12.502
and then the bad ones are worse
than we remember them,

20:12.586 --> 20:15.589
but our minds, they play these games
so we don't kill ourselves.

20:15.672 --> 20:17.424
And we just keep doing shit.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.929
Suzanne wants to talk to me so bad,
why don't she come and do it herself?

20:22.012 --> 20:23.263
Have you met her?

20:23.847 --> 20:24.848
She's weird.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.476
But have you met you? 'Cause you're terrifying.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.817
So why don't you just come to the library,
and you go down that wormhold?

20:35.901 --> 20:39.613
-It's "wormhole."
-No. No, it's not!

20:39.696 --> 20:42.574
No, it's not. I'm trying something new.

20:47.537 --> 20:49.665
I understand,
but did you have to surprise me like that?

20:49.748 --> 20:54.378
Yes, I did. Did you forget, Ms. Chapman?
You are on probation.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.546
My job is rolling up on people.

20:56.630 --> 20:59.466
How else can I catch them violating
or doing drugs

20:59.549 --> 21:01.009
or running a baby fight club?

21:01.093 --> 21:03.178
I promise you
I'm not running a baby fight club.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.639
I know. I'm just being funny.

21:06.556 --> 21:08.725
Ooh! Snickerdoodle. May I?

21:09.434 --> 21:11.812
Please. They don't eat flour.

21:11.895 --> 21:12.896
What?

21:13.772 --> 21:16.358
Well, let me tell you what's not funny.

21:16.650 --> 21:18.610
It's when I rolled up to the restaurant

21:18.694 --> 21:21.947
that my newest supervisee
told me that she worked at,

21:22.406 --> 21:25.951
only to be informed
that you were fired last week.

21:27.119 --> 21:30.122
I guess I was feeling
so badly about being fired,

21:30.205 --> 21:33.709
I didn't want to tell you
that I had been fired.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.751
I'm sorry.

21:35.252 --> 21:40.215
Okay, you need to tell me immediately
when there's a change of employment.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.259
So, now, do you have a new job?

21:42.551 --> 21:44.344
Here. Nannying for my niece.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.013
And are they paying you?

21:46.596 --> 21:48.515
In room and board and baby hugs.

21:48.598 --> 21:51.476
Don't be cute.
Only I get to do that.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.689
Will they be giving you a W-2
for your taxes at the end of the year?

21:55.772 --> 21:58.942
-I don't think so.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.152
That's a favor.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.030
Let me keep you on track,
Ms. Chapman, okay?

22:03.613 --> 22:07.743
We have a rapport, but I can issue
a warrant for your arrest if need be.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.955
So get a real job. Like, today.

22:15.083 --> 22:21.506
Hey. The other ladies left because
they heard the um, former-felon thing.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.176
But, uh, listen, we are here for you.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.471
Literally no one is here for me.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.766
Which must be hard to understand
because you're not a mom,

22:30.849 --> 22:32.976
but at the end of the day, we're just...

22:33.060 --> 22:36.229
we're just not comfortable.
I mean, I am cool with you.

22:36.313 --> 22:38.565
But this one... Judgmental.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.525
So I totally get it, though.

22:40.609 --> 22:44.529
Getting back on your feet post-prison
must be so hard.

22:44.613 --> 22:46.823
And we support you.

22:47.741 --> 22:51.203
Sending good vibes, okay? Okay.

22:53.997 --> 22:57.876
Damn. That... that was cold.

23:01.338 --> 23:02.464
Hey, Hellman.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.050
Boo!

23:05.258 --> 23:07.636
Does this bother you?
Doesn't this bother you, huh?

23:11.431 --> 23:14.351
Shit. Someone's not in the mood.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.477
Not today.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.437
Oh, that's too bad.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.565
'Cause I had a lot of time
to think in the SHU.

23:20.649 --> 23:21.858
Oh, yeah?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.611
We gotta talk about Vause.

23:25.153 --> 23:26.696
Thought it was Jefferson you'd be after.

23:26.780 --> 23:28.949
Jefferson never
would have fucked with me

23:29.032 --> 23:30.158
if Vause hadn't set me up.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.036
So you're too scared
to beef with Jefferson?

23:34.287 --> 23:37.416
I'm gonna deal with that crazy nightmare
in my own good time.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.334
After we deal with Vause.

23:40.335 --> 23:42.379
Hey, I'm not opposed.

23:42.462 --> 23:45.632
That cunt flushed 1,500 bucks worth
of salt down the crapper today.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.759
Oh. Exactly.

23:48.927 --> 23:52.639
So you should get that cunt transferred.

23:53.223 --> 23:54.683
Someplace wicked far away

23:54.766 --> 23:58.103
where she'll never get to see
her lesbo wife again.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.731
That's actually not bad.

24:09.739 --> 24:13.034
I need to figure out a way
to get my birth certificate.

24:13.118 --> 24:15.370
Show these motherfuckers
I don't belong here.

24:16.204 --> 24:21.626
OMG!
Look! Look, it's a turtledove!

24:24.379 --> 24:30.635
It's-- It's a sign! Of-- Of life or hope
or fuckin' keep on trying or something.

24:31.553 --> 24:35.307
It's a sign you can get shit on
at any moment, even indoors.

24:35.390 --> 24:39.811
I need to call...
I gotta call Daisy or my sister or my mom.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.482
As soon as I figure out
one of their phone numbers.

24:44.566 --> 24:47.360
You don't know anyone's numbers?
Not even your mother's?

24:48.069 --> 24:49.988
I'm young, remember?

24:52.741 --> 24:54.951
Plus, I don't really have
a great relationship with my mom.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.037
And my mom doesn't have
a great relationship

24:57.120 --> 24:58.497
with paying the phone bill.

24:58.580 --> 25:03.126
So the only numbers I remember
are 911 or ones with songs.

25:03.668 --> 25:05.337
Like, for pizzas and shit.

25:08.131 --> 25:10.842
Oh, my God. I know who we should call.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.261
-1-800-Get-Sprung!
-Gross.

25:13.345 --> 25:17.015
No, no. Seriously. You haven't heard
of that lawyer, Kay Sprung?

25:17.599 --> 25:20.810
<i>♪ DUI at night got you moaning? ♪ </i>

25:20.894 --> 25:25.232
<i>♪ Call Kay Sprung</i>
<i>And get off in the morning ♪ </i>

25:25.649 --> 25:27.567
-Yes!

25:27.651 --> 25:31.279
Because I slept with someone
in their legal office. And...

25:32.739 --> 25:35.534
it's a 1-800 number, so it's free.

25:37.035 --> 25:40.622
Why don't you just get this?
Nothing here is free.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.749
Not even a 1-800 number.

25:43.333 --> 25:47.128
You need to buy a phone card
from the machine. With money.

25:47.712 --> 25:49.130
Do you have any money?

25:49.714 --> 25:50.590
No.

25:52.842 --> 25:54.177
Do you have any money?

25:58.098 --> 25:58.974
Yes.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.894
I have $30 left from what came
from down the hill.

26:03.728 --> 26:07.607
So come on!
A lawyer could help both of us.

26:13.905 --> 26:17.867
Yeah! See? The dove was a sign.
The dove was a sign.

26:18.827 --> 26:21.037
Nine "Service needed. Please call."

26:24.958 --> 26:27.335
Machine of the Devil!

26:27.419 --> 26:29.170
Fuck your mother
on the altar!

26:30.755 --> 26:32.132
Everything went to shit!

26:32.215 --> 26:34.175
How so

26:35.552 --> 26:37.470
So it's good? Look at it.

26:37.554 --> 26:39.222
Sancocho tastes better to me.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.558
Yes. It's good.

26:42.934 --> 26:45.145
Not as good as
my mother's Olla soup, but...

26:45.228 --> 26:47.272
...you're getting there.

26:50.609 --> 26:52.902
Bianca? Bianca!

26:52.986 --> 26:55.322
You should go. She's home.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.616
Bianca!

26:59.034 --> 27:00.827
Oh, fuck.

27:04.789 --> 27:06.166
What happened?

27:06.249 --> 27:08.752
I went grocery shopping.
What does it look like?

27:08.835 --> 27:11.838
Now, come and help me unload.
What is he doing here?

27:11.921 --> 27:14.007
Never mind him. What happened to the car?

27:14.716 --> 27:16.801
Oh! I was driving along,

27:16.885 --> 27:20.305
and this mailman runs right out of nowhere
and right into my car.

27:20.388 --> 27:22.140
You mean his truck ran into your car?

27:22.223 --> 27:27.646
No, he did. He hit my car with his body.
Right out of nowhere, I tell ya!

27:28.021 --> 27:29.105
My God.

27:29.189 --> 27:32.275
I knew it was too soon for the old bat
to start driving again!

27:32.359 --> 27:36.154
Okay, what happened to him?
Did the ambulance come and get him?

27:36.237 --> 27:38.198
How am I supposed to know?

27:38.281 --> 27:42.118
I left before they could say
it was my fault. It was clearly his.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.162
We have to call the cops.

27:44.245 --> 27:47.707
No. No, no, no, no.
-<i>Mi amor,</i> I don't know about this.

27:47.791 --> 27:49.250
You could get into trouble...

27:49.334 --> 27:51.127
So could she! Huh?

27:51.628 --> 27:53.755
And if she goes, I lose my job and--

27:53.838 --> 27:56.758
Bianca, I've told you
so many times, speaka the English.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.761
You're sure about this, my love?

27:59.844 --> 28:03.807
Yes. She's a fucking cunt,
but she's my fucking cunt.

28:03.890 --> 28:06.893
Stop watching me
and help me unload!

28:08.937 --> 28:10.855
I got these 12 for a dollar.

28:10.939 --> 28:13.233
If you're nice to me,
maybe I'll give you one.

28:15.318 --> 28:18.697
You know, go.
I'll-- I'll call you later. It'll be fine.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.782
Yeah. Scram, buster!

28:36.339 --> 28:40.135
And then in the legend,
I put, "D is for Diarrhea."

28:40.927 --> 28:46.975
Tell me,
did you write down every single thing

28:47.058 --> 28:49.978
that happened while I was gone?

28:50.061 --> 28:53.523
No, I just wrote down three things
that stood out from every day,

28:53.606 --> 28:55.108
so they wouldn't all meld together.

28:55.191 --> 28:59.320
Oh. Did you hear
there were two murders and one OD?

28:59.404 --> 29:01.698
But rumor is that was a murder, too.

29:01.781 --> 29:05.618
Reznikov, new work assignment.
They want you to run a kitchen.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.747
Pick four inmates to help you
and give me the list by tomorrow.

29:08.830 --> 29:09.831
No.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.625
That wasn't an invitation, inmate.
That was an order.

29:12.709 --> 29:15.503
I'll say it again. No.

29:15.795 --> 29:19.174
Dwight, please keep reading
from your boring book.

29:19.257 --> 29:21.384
Maybe that will drive her away.

29:22.051 --> 29:24.721
Here's from a section
I called "Wonderings."

29:25.054 --> 29:28.975
"What day is it in Stevie Wonder's song,
'I Just Called to Say I Love You'?

29:29.058 --> 29:31.311
We know it's not New Year's Day.
We know it's not--"

29:31.394 --> 29:33.646
I don't understand.
Everyone wants the kitchen gig.

29:33.730 --> 29:36.107
-Not anymore.

29:36.191 --> 29:39.903
Oh, and Thursday's memory
was my grandmother's Vicks VapoRub.

29:39.986 --> 29:40.904
Hmm.

29:40.987 --> 29:44.449
I'm not the only inmate
with experience running a kitchen.

29:45.742 --> 29:47.494
You should ask Gloria.

29:48.328 --> 29:50.288
Gloria who?

29:52.081 --> 29:53.166
Mendoza.

29:55.585 --> 29:56.753
Suit yourself.

30:02.550 --> 30:03.593
<i>I don't understand.</i>

30:03.676 --> 30:06.179
The new <i>Outlander</i> season
ain't even out yet.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.932
Oh! Wait.
You went to the Dark Web, huh?

30:09.015 --> 30:12.519
Mmm. I heard all about the Dark Web
on Black Twitter.

30:17.982 --> 30:19.776
Well, well...

30:21.152 --> 30:22.862
The fuck is this?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.156
Parent trapped!

30:25.448 --> 30:27.534
The hell are you doing,
Suzanne?

30:27.617 --> 30:32.163
This is your chance
to make everything better.

30:32.247 --> 30:33.248
Now...

30:34.541 --> 30:35.792
commence!

30:39.546 --> 30:40.922
"Commence," huh?

30:53.977 --> 30:56.896
Taystee, I tried to make it right.
You gotta know I did.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.982
You gotta know I did.
I went and talked to the lawyer,

30:59.065 --> 31:00.608
-but it was too late--
-Taystee, don't go.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.944
Suzanne, I will throw you
across this fucking room.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.153
Hear me out.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.907
All I want is for us to be friends again.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.367
No! I know you're gonna say,

31:09.450 --> 31:14.247
"No, no, that friend ship has sailed,"
but I need us to fix this.

31:14.330 --> 31:16.833
-I don't know!

31:17.166 --> 31:19.544
Make your own justice.

31:20.211 --> 31:21.796
I know what I would do.

31:22.547 --> 31:23.631
Beat her ass.

31:27.760 --> 31:29.012
Go for it.

31:32.181 --> 31:33.182
Beat me up.

31:36.019 --> 31:37.103
I deserve it.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.481
That's what you want, huh?

32:00.960 --> 32:02.211
Fuck you.

32:07.717 --> 32:08.718
Taystee...

32:16.768 --> 32:18.561
Get your last look at Morticia,

32:18.645 --> 32:22.023
'cause we're about to say bye-bye-bye
to her creepy ass, thanks to me.

32:22.106 --> 32:23.399
What'd you do?

32:23.483 --> 32:27.612
That's for me to know and you to witness
as my plan slowly unfolds.

32:28.279 --> 32:32.450
Or maybe you won't see anything at all!

32:33.034 --> 32:35.453
All you need to know
is that bitch is going down.

32:36.829 --> 32:38.164
What'd you say?

32:40.041 --> 32:42.961
Oh, no. I wasn't talking about you.
I was talking about someone else.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.712
That's what I thought.

32:48.466 --> 32:51.803
See? We cool.
That's my Taystee girl right there!

33:03.314 --> 33:05.400
Stop! Jefferson, stop!

33:05.483 --> 33:08.444
10-33! Need help down here! 10-33!

33:11.114 --> 33:13.658
Taystee, let go! Let go!

33:17.829 --> 33:18.997
No! Shit!

33:33.177 --> 33:36.180
Shut it down! Fight's over! Shut it down!

33:42.770 --> 33:44.147
Hopper, what do you want me
to do with them?

33:44.897 --> 33:46.524
Well, we can't put 'em in SHU.

33:47.483 --> 33:48.568
I don't know, Warden.

33:48.651 --> 33:51.320
What do they say to do
about this situation in night school?

33:51.571 --> 33:52.488
Uh...

33:53.448 --> 33:54.866
We could, um...

33:55.658 --> 33:56.534
Uh...

33:57.076 --> 34:00.204
All right, lock them
in separate cells, alone.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.458
Double up the others if you have to,
and we'll figure it out from there.

34:04.417 --> 34:05.460
Move!

34:14.260 --> 34:15.970
Hi! You're so pretty!

34:16.596 --> 34:19.557
Anyway, listen. My friend has money
in her account,

34:19.640 --> 34:22.310
but the kiosk is broken
and there aren't any more phone cards,

34:22.393 --> 34:23.978
-so--
-Wait. Wait. Um...

34:24.062 --> 34:25.521
Do you speak Spanish?

34:25.772 --> 34:28.107
Uh, perhaps French?

34:29.067 --> 34:30.068
English?

34:30.443 --> 34:33.738
Yes, but you'll never know that!

34:34.405 --> 34:37.075
Leave me alone, you rogue thieves.

34:37.158 --> 34:38.868
Oh! Ugh!

34:38.951 --> 34:42.038
Okay. Is it rude to wish
that more people in here spoke English?

34:42.121 --> 34:45.458
Yes, it is very rude.

34:46.125 --> 34:48.252
Oh. Hello. I could not help but listen in
on your conversation earlier.

34:50.546 --> 34:52.632
See, that's sort of my thing.

34:53.424 --> 34:56.719
Here's my phone card
on which I have $12 remaining.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.679
When the machine is working again,

34:58.763 --> 35:01.974
I expect a transfer of $30
from the wild one's account.

35:02.058 --> 35:03.434
That's a total rip-off.

35:03.518 --> 35:07.438
Yes, but I don't really know you.
It's $12 plus the risk I'm assuming.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.190
-Deal.
-No deal.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.443
Dude, it's $5 a minute.
It takes three minutes to connect.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.112
Okay. All we need is two minutes.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.572
That's all my money.
-Thank you.

35:17.573 --> 35:18.407
Uh, your name again?

35:18.491 --> 35:21.994
Efua Onagbeboma.
Sorry, I do not shake hands.

35:22.078 --> 35:23.496
Okay. It's, like, a cultural thing.

35:24.080 --> 35:25.123
Germophobe.

35:25.456 --> 35:26.415
Right.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.795
Okay.

35:32.547 --> 35:33.422
Hi!

35:34.090 --> 35:36.175
Uh, yes. Can I please speak-- No, no, no!

35:37.093 --> 35:38.803
This fucking bitch put me on hold.

35:39.846 --> 35:40.930
Good day.

35:41.472 --> 35:44.267
Yes. May I please speak
to Jason the paralegal?

35:45.143 --> 35:48.771
Yes, Jason.
The one with the face and the cute--

35:49.397 --> 35:50.857
Fuck! This bitch put me on hold...

35:51.649 --> 35:53.860
Jason! Hi!

35:54.819 --> 35:56.070
Yeah, it's Maritza. Maritza Ramos.

35:59.365 --> 36:01.367
We met at the funeral.

36:03.119 --> 36:06.497
Y
The one with the, um, afterlife theme?

36:08.916 --> 36:11.043
You said I was the first to do
the wheelbarrow thing with you.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.462
Okay, listen. So I...

36:14.755 --> 36:16.090
I need a lawyer.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.886
I'm an American citizen,
and I've been detained by ICE. And--

36:21.345 --> 36:22.346
The fuck?

36:24.390 --> 36:26.517
Hello

36:26.893 --> 36:28.519
The card is spent?

36:30.771 --> 36:32.940
-Oh, my God.
Unbelievable!

36:33.399 --> 36:35.776
Blanca, wait! Where are you going?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.153
Nowhere.

36:37.236 --> 36:39.113
'Cause there's nowhere to fucking go

36:39.197 --> 36:42.575
and no one to fucking call,
you stupid, dumb, Colombian Barbie.

36:43.784 --> 36:46.245
Okay. One, I'm Colombian-American.

36:46.329 --> 36:48.915
And two, what does my hotness
have to do with this?

36:48.998 --> 36:50.833
-Okay. Listen, listen.

36:52.585 --> 36:54.754
We have to stay positive.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.882
Okay? T-- Think about our bird of hope!

36:57.965 --> 37:00.760
You wasted our last fucking opportunity.

37:01.135 --> 37:03.554
Just leave me alone. Okay?

37:04.263 --> 37:07.850
I can't believe, of all people,
that you're giving up!

37:08.226 --> 37:11.229
You are the stankass
who pissed herself back at camp

37:11.312 --> 37:12.980
so the guards wouldn't touch you.

37:13.397 --> 37:15.358
Bitch, you stood on tables.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.402
That's not who I am anymore.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.613
I already had nothing,

37:21.197 --> 37:25.201
and now I have less than nothing
because of you, dumbass.

37:25.284 --> 37:27.995
Don't blame me
because your boyfriend abandoned you.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.497
At least I'm trying!

37:29.580 --> 37:31.916
Well, stop! Stop trying!

37:32.667 --> 37:34.085
Stop hoping.

37:34.627 --> 37:38.172
Because look around you.
Nobody is coming for us.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.301
And it's not a fucking dove,
you fucking idiot!

37:42.385 --> 37:43.761
It's a pigeon.

37:44.095 --> 37:46.681
Okay. Pigeon, dove...
It's the same fucking thing!

37:46.764 --> 37:49.308
No, it's not.

37:50.559 --> 37:53.062
Nobody gives a fuck about pigeons.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.840
-Hello.

38:20.923 --> 38:22.550
Baby? Baby, it's me.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.302
Blanca?

38:26.804 --> 38:31.225
Oh, my God! I'm so relieved to hear you.

38:31.726 --> 38:34.353
What happened
I don't understand.

38:34.437 --> 38:35.771
I don't understand, either.

38:35.855 --> 38:38.065
They're not
telling us anything.

38:38.566 --> 38:42.194
ICE grabbed me outside
of Litchfield, and now I'm in Arizona.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.406
Well, no problem. I'm coming tomorrow.

38:46.198 --> 38:48.826
I'll borrow money and drive there.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.078
It's not worth it.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.749
They just keep
transferring people for no reason.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.794
I'm asking them why they're
doing all this, but no one will tell me.

38:58.878 --> 38:59.837
And they are treating us...

38:59.920 --> 39:01.881
They're just treating us so...

39:02.590 --> 39:05.968
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why this is happening.</i>

39:06.969 --> 39:08.262
Me neither.

39:09.972 --> 39:11.432
I'm sorry, baby.

39:12.641 --> 39:16.562
I know I ruined everything
for us before because of that old cunt.

39:17.730 --> 39:20.483
And it was one thing when you wanted
to wait the two years for me...

39:20.566 --> 39:21.650
But this?

39:22.276 --> 39:24.987
You can't keep waiting forever.

39:25.071 --> 39:27.365
No, my love, don't say that.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.825
We've gotten through
everything else in the past.

39:29.909 --> 39:32.244
We're gonna get through this, too. Okay?

39:32.870 --> 39:33.871
<i> What's a few more months</i>

39:33.954 --> 39:35.748
<i>while we figure this out?</i>

39:35.831 --> 39:37.792
We have the rest of our lives together.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.629
We're gonna try heroin
when we're 80, remember?

39:42.713 --> 39:45.216
<i>We're gonna have</i>
<i>our own washer and dryer.</i>

39:45.299 --> 39:47.385
And a dog named...

39:47.760 --> 39:48.803
Mojito.

39:51.806 --> 39:52.807
Baby...

39:53.474 --> 39:55.643
I love you very much. Tell me...

39:55.726 --> 39:58.562
Uh, what
I need to know.

39:58.646 --> 39:59.855
Okay. Get a pen.

40:00.606 --> 40:02.566
I'm gonna give you my alien number. <i> Use it to track me online.</i>

40:05.611 --> 40:07.196
Find out what happened
to the "permanent"

40:07.279 --> 40:09.698
in my "permanent resident"
status.

40:10.533 --> 40:12.451
<i>Hang tight, my beautiful dove.</i>

40:14.495 --> 40:17.081
-Wardy Ward, wait up!
-Don't call me that.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.500
What's up, Hellman?

40:19.834 --> 40:23.087
Hey, don't mind Hopper today.
He's under a lot of pressure lately.

40:23.629 --> 40:25.423
Oh! He's under a lot of pressure?

40:25.506 --> 40:28.342
Yeah, yeah.
But listen, I think I can help you.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.762
I've been looking at this whole situation,
you want my opinion?

40:32.471 --> 40:33.889
You need to transfer Vause.

40:36.058 --> 40:37.143
Vause?

40:37.852 --> 40:39.520
Trust me, it's for her protection.

40:39.603 --> 40:42.565
I mean, if you look at it,
she's the root of all this stuff.

40:42.648 --> 40:43.774
Murphy and her crew have it out for her.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.026
It's only a matter of time
before she leaves here on a stretcher.

40:46.652 --> 40:49.113
Now--
Now, I know you have a lot on your plate,

40:49.488 --> 40:53.033
so I already filled out the request.
All's you have to do is sign it.

40:53.117 --> 40:54.869
Sure, I'll take a look.

40:54.952 --> 40:57.163
Awesome. Just looking out for you.

40:57.746 --> 41:00.416
I think another incident
like that free-for-all back there

41:00.499 --> 41:02.251
would be a bad look for the new warden.

41:03.127 --> 41:06.422
And by the way, I love that blazer on you.

41:14.263 --> 41:16.182
So is it everything
you thought it would be?

41:17.308 --> 41:18.517
What are you doing here?

41:18.601 --> 41:22.354
Grabbing a few things.
The new place is really bare bones.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.565
So, how was your first day?

41:25.441 --> 41:26.817
Good. Good.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.528
Oh, this.

41:30.696 --> 41:32.656
Workplace hazard, you know?

41:33.491 --> 41:34.533
God damn it!

41:35.409 --> 41:36.869
How the hell do you ever
adjust this thing?

41:36.952 --> 41:38.287
You can't. It's broken.

41:39.455 --> 41:40.623
I put in a request months ago.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.000
Fuck.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.587
You are not gonna last long
around this place

41:46.670 --> 41:49.381
if a broken chair sends you
into that kind of tailspin.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.926
It's not about the stupid chair.

41:53.719 --> 41:55.095
Can I ask you an honest question?

41:55.179 --> 41:57.932
Only if you want an unyielding answer.

41:59.642 --> 42:01.685
I only got this job because I'm black...

42:02.978 --> 42:03.979
right?

42:04.063 --> 42:05.189
Pretty much.

42:12.196 --> 42:15.866
And I only had it because I'm a woman.

42:15.950 --> 42:20.579
And I only got the new job
because I'm a fucking bitch.

42:21.580 --> 42:25.251
Look, it doesn't really matter
how we get the job.

42:25.334 --> 42:28.546
What matters is what we do
once we have them.

42:34.343 --> 42:36.512
That your suggestion box?

42:37.263 --> 42:38.097
Yeah.

42:39.682 --> 42:40.683
Cute.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.561
Here's my suggestion.

42:44.228 --> 42:47.606
Do whatever the fuck you want.

42:49.149 --> 42:50.693
And get a better blazer.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.325
Red! What are you doing?

43:04.623 --> 43:06.917
I've been looking
all over the place for you.

43:07.585 --> 43:11.839
The sound of the tumble noise
is very soothing.

43:20.889 --> 43:24.310
You know, they came by my cell,
offered me the kitchen.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.355
But I also know you turned it down.

43:28.439 --> 43:32.401
And they say Russians
are the ones to leak things.

43:32.860 --> 43:35.404
Since when do you voluntarily
give kitchens to me?

43:40.159 --> 43:41.160
Gloria...

43:43.370 --> 43:44.913
I don't think I can do it.

43:47.458 --> 43:50.961
Something happened to me in that box.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.007
I left part of myself in there.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.637
How are you okay?

44:00.220 --> 44:01.555
I don't think that I am.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.185
But...

44:07.478 --> 44:09.480
I think the way we get back to...

44:10.397 --> 44:14.068
who we were before
is by doing the things we did before.

44:14.151 --> 44:15.194
You know what I mean?

44:15.569 --> 44:16.820
Before what?

44:17.571 --> 44:20.407
The SHU

44:21.825 --> 44:23.535
America?

44:24.787 --> 44:28.540
Listen, I want the kitchen,
but only if you're there with me.

44:29.083 --> 44:31.835
That's how we get
those parts of ourselves back, Red.

44:33.212 --> 44:34.713
Maybe we can, um...

44:35.714 --> 44:38.133
get some of the old gang together again.

44:39.093 --> 44:40.469
Nicky and Lorna.

44:42.096 --> 44:43.597
Norma and Gina.

44:46.642 --> 44:48.060
Norma and Gina aren't here.

44:50.604 --> 44:52.189
No, of course.

44:55.192 --> 44:57.236
So it'll be like old times?

44:58.487 --> 44:59.363
Yeah.

45:00.823 --> 45:04.243
I'll run the kitchen,
and you'll be my lieutenant.

45:04.535 --> 45:09.748
Oh!  I see how you Russians work.

45:10.708 --> 45:13.460
You say communism,
but you mean dictatorship.

45:17.172 --> 45:20.426
Suzanne, what the hell are you doing?
You're gonna get a shot.

45:20.509 --> 45:21.802
I'm sad.

45:23.178 --> 45:24.847
I'm sad and I don't feel better,

45:24.930 --> 45:26.849
and neither does Cindy,
and neither does Taystee,

45:26.932 --> 45:29.059
and nothing ever makes me feel better.

45:29.143 --> 45:32.771
Shh! Let's just think.
Let's think about this.

45:32.855 --> 45:35.774
There's got to be some way
that we can make this right.

45:37.526 --> 45:42.740
Tell me, does anything else happen
in any of these other movies you've seen?

45:42.823 --> 45:43.907
I don't know.

45:44.700 --> 45:48.245
All I know is that
this terrible thing happened

45:48.328 --> 45:51.081
and there is no going back
unless we do an <i>Outlander</i>

45:51.165 --> 45:54.042
and go through the stone
of Craigh na Dun--

45:54.126 --> 45:57.004
-Then, tell me what happened at camp.
-I can't tell you anything.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.508
-Cindy told me not to tell anyone.
-Fine.

46:04.678 --> 46:08.974
She told you not to tell any persons,
but...

46:10.851 --> 46:12.811
can you tell me?

46:13.562 --> 46:19.568
Hm? I mean, technically, I'm not a person,
seeing as I have no blood or vital organs.

46:30.496 --> 46:34.833
You promise, promise,
never to repeat this?

46:36.001 --> 46:37.961
Oh, I promise, promise.

46:45.135 --> 46:47.471
Okay.

46:49.598 --> 46:50.599
So...

46:57.648 --> 47:00.067
I brought donuts.

47:01.318 --> 47:03.195
Your mother has me doing the Whole30.

47:03.654 --> 47:05.072
I don't know what that is.

47:06.657 --> 47:08.367
Prison, remember?

47:08.450 --> 47:11.620
Yeah. Trust me, I'll never forget.

47:16.917 --> 47:17.960
So, if you brought the donuts,

47:18.043 --> 47:20.546
I take it you're able to pay me back
the $50 you borrowed?

47:20.629 --> 47:23.006
Soon. So soon.

47:24.383 --> 47:27.553
Do you remember that summer
I interned for you in high school?

47:28.387 --> 47:31.807
I was wondering if I could do that again.

47:32.349 --> 47:35.060
But as a job. If you'd hire me.

47:35.143 --> 47:38.146
Piper, I don't think my clients
are gonna be comfortable with a felon

47:38.230 --> 47:39.815
looking through their credit information.

47:39.898 --> 47:43.861
I'll file, make copies,
make coffee, make anything.

47:43.944 --> 47:45.195
I want to pay you back.

47:46.864 --> 47:48.073
For everything.

47:48.574 --> 47:50.576
So I'm supposed to help you pay me back?

47:51.910 --> 47:52.911
Yep.

47:53.829 --> 47:55.497
Because I'm still your daughter.

47:56.790 --> 48:00.377
Because life isn't long enough
for us to be like this.

48:02.588 --> 48:04.715
Maybe this is the beginning
of a road back.

48:07.676 --> 48:09.136
There's gotta be a way back.

48:13.849 --> 48:18.061
I have been meaning
to, uh, digitize all my old files.

48:21.690 --> 48:24.443
How are you with minutiae
and following direction? Good. Very good.

48:28.238 --> 48:29.698
Prison, remember?

48:33.702 --> 48:35.037
Please get rid of this donut.

48:37.748 --> 48:39.833
Any notes on my performance yesterday?

48:40.667 --> 48:44.087
Maybe the whole getting-in-my-face
part was a bit on the nose,

48:44.171 --> 48:46.131
but I think Hellman bought it.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.926
He bought it. He was so pissed,

48:49.009 --> 48:51.345
he actually ate all the burritos
he brought in.

48:53.972 --> 48:56.475
By the way, I got the stuff.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.353
Raided my mom's medicine cabinet.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.104
I'm not sure what those are,

49:01.188 --> 49:03.023
and some might be expired,
but it's a start.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.858
A random assortment of pills?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.820
This one says "Centrum Complete."

49:09.613 --> 49:11.281
Have you seen the people in here?

49:11.657 --> 49:14.368
I'd think a multivitamin
would be a hot commodity.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.621
You need heroin or something good.

49:17.704 --> 49:22.542
Fine. Sell heroin from
where you get heroin from.

49:22.876 --> 49:24.252
I get it from you.

49:25.128 --> 49:27.589
Well, I don't know how to get heroin.

49:28.590 --> 49:30.008
Then how did you think this was gonna work

49:30.092 --> 49:31.969
when you roped me
into your fucking scheme?

49:33.804 --> 49:36.098
And why did I actually flush the drugs?

49:37.224 --> 49:40.143
I don't know. It had to look real.

49:42.062 --> 49:44.773
I'm sorry I don't know
how to procure heroin, okay?

49:45.774 --> 49:48.235
I'm one of the good ones.
This is all new to me.

49:48.527 --> 49:51.530
Not anymore.
You're forcing me to sell drugs for you.

49:52.781 --> 49:53.657
Look,

49:54.908 --> 49:57.911
things are a little tough right now
and I really need the money, okay?

49:58.286 --> 50:02.541
It's a long story. I just-- I need it.
So just sell the pills.

50:03.166 --> 50:04.126
Or else...

50:08.839 --> 50:12.217
All right, look, there is...
There is another thing we can do.

50:14.344 --> 50:16.304
You know how everyone
has a phone in here, right?

50:17.014 --> 50:18.515
You know what they don't have?

50:20.142 --> 50:21.184
Headphones.

50:21.643 --> 50:23.061
Jesus. You are bad at this.

50:23.145 --> 50:24.354
They don't have juice.

50:24.896 --> 50:26.523
Badison sold everyone a phone,

50:26.773 --> 50:29.234
but it's so hard to get a charge in here
without getting caught.

50:29.317 --> 50:31.820
If you could bring in
those portable charger things,

50:32.362 --> 50:33.447
we could make a mint.

50:33.864 --> 50:35.699
And it's not a felony.

50:36.408 --> 50:37.784
We charge people to charge.

50:39.870 --> 50:41.121
I'll go to a Target.

50:43.206 --> 50:45.459
Or is this more of a Costco type of thing?

50:45.709 --> 50:47.586
Either way, I'll go right after work.

50:47.919 --> 50:49.129
Actually, I can't go right after work--

50:49.212 --> 50:52.007
-I don't need to know your life.
-Okay.

50:53.216 --> 50:57.095
And, I mean, when Jefferson gave
that right cross to Murphy's face? Yowza.

50:59.681 --> 51:00.682
Morning.

51:03.560 --> 51:05.896
Hopper, take a look.

51:06.146 --> 51:07.731
Making some changes around here.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.358
Great, let's hope
you've come to your senses.

51:10.442 --> 51:11.902
You're reopening the SHU?

51:11.985 --> 51:16.323
Nope. Making strategic
inmate transfers instead.

51:17.407 --> 51:21.661
Move Tasha Jefferson back to D-Block
and Cindy Hayes over to Florida.

51:23.705 --> 51:26.208
Oh, and, Hellman, about Vause...

51:27.167 --> 51:28.919
Thanks for the suggestion.

51:29.002 --> 51:32.923
But I looked into it,
and it's Murphy who keeps getting jumped.

51:33.715 --> 51:35.884
That's why she's being
transferred to Missouri.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.678
Ward, this is crazy.
You can't do all this!

51:41.139 --> 51:43.642
Tell me again what I can't do.

51:47.479 --> 51:52.859
Oh, and, Dixon, carry this chair
down to my office for me.

51:53.276 --> 51:54.319
Yes, ma'am.

52:03.537 --> 52:04.621
Hopper, sorry.

52:09.376 --> 52:12.045
Hey, um, thanks for adding me
to your new crew.

52:12.129 --> 52:15.882
You were always one of my best girls
and, frankly, you're the only one left.

52:15.966 --> 52:19.594
Oh, we missed you, Red.
And Sterling missed you, too.

52:19.678 --> 52:20.637
Sterling?

52:20.720 --> 52:23.640
That's right.
You don't even know who he is yet.

52:23.723 --> 52:25.725
You gotta see this kid, Red.

52:25.809 --> 52:29.396
Yes, of course.
I can't wait to see this little <i>yozhik.</i>

52:29.479 --> 52:31.231
It's good to have you back.

52:31.314 --> 52:33.650
Hey, yo, Blake, I know
I'm not the boss of this place,

52:33.733 --> 52:35.318
but isn't the kitchen back that way?

52:35.402 --> 52:37.946
Kitchen? I was told
to take you to the van.

52:40.031 --> 52:41.491
Well, maybe it's a good surprise.

52:42.033 --> 52:44.953
Like a outdoor barbecue-type situation.

52:45.036 --> 52:49.708
Oh, right. I'll just add that to the list
of good prison surprises we've all had.

52:53.920 --> 52:55.172
"US Marshal"?

52:56.339 --> 52:59.342
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. What's this?

52:59.885 --> 53:03.013
-Relax. It's not your ride.

53:03.638 --> 53:04.639
Coming through!

53:04.723 --> 53:07.142
Please, don't do this.
I don't know anyone in Missouri.

53:07.225 --> 53:09.603
Then maybe you should have been Goodison.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.190
Don't tell me those bitches
are coming with me.

53:13.273 --> 53:14.816
Nope, just you.

53:17.611 --> 53:19.404
-Please.
Nah.

53:21.948 --> 53:23.909
Fuck!

53:28.955 --> 53:32.709
I'm so confused. Where are we going?

53:35.295 --> 53:38.006
This way my sister will know
it's really me.

53:38.089 --> 53:40.926
You think someone would forge your letter
from a detention center?

53:41.343 --> 53:44.221
You wouldn't understand.
I've had a lot of stalkers over the years.

53:44.679 --> 53:46.723
Right. Because of your face?

53:47.224 --> 53:48.350
And my body.

53:51.436 --> 53:53.939
Excuse me. Where is the outgoing mail?

53:54.022 --> 53:57.442
It's over there.
But you need to put a stamp on it first.

53:57.817 --> 53:59.778
Okay. Well, where do I get a stamp?

54:00.362 --> 54:01.529
At the kiosk.

54:02.405 --> 54:04.032
But the kiosk is broken.

54:04.115 --> 54:07.285
Which is why I couldn't get a phone card,
which is why I wrote a letter.

54:07.619 --> 54:10.538
This was before I made a real enemy
by stealing this envelope

54:11.039 --> 54:13.541
and after I traded in my food
for the paper

54:13.625 --> 54:14.793
and my socks for the pen.

54:14.876 --> 54:17.337
And now you're saying
that there's no more stamps?

54:19.714 --> 54:20.757
Wish I could help.

54:23.218 --> 54:26.221
Let's go. It's not worth it.

54:26.304 --> 54:27.514
I don't wanna hear it.

54:28.306 --> 54:29.557
I wasn't gonna say it.

54:42.362 --> 54:45.740
Baby, are you crying?

54:47.075 --> 54:48.368
Oh, my love.

54:51.288 --> 54:53.164
-You look beautiful.

54:54.374 --> 54:55.709
You do, too.

54:56.668 --> 54:59.629
All right, enough with the PDA.
Talk or walk.

55:03.300 --> 55:05.468
<i>Bueno,</i> baby, I looked into it.

55:07.512 --> 55:09.848
I used
all the coffee can money

55:10.265 --> 55:13.310
and got an appointment
with an immigration lawyer.

55:13.393 --> 55:15.603
And

55:17.063 --> 55:18.189
It's not good.

55:19.357 --> 55:21.526
She says
that your green card's been invalidated

55:21.609 --> 55:24.112
because you committed
a deportable offense.

55:24.821 --> 55:27.157
For covering up
for the old lady's hit

55:27.240 --> 55:28.950
No, it wasn't that.

55:29.034 --> 55:32.996
She said it was because you pled guilty
to being an organizer in the riot.

55:35.040 --> 55:37.000
That's why they didn't give me extra time.

55:37.834 --> 55:39.377
To set me up with this shit!

55:39.461 --> 55:42.130
I know, I know.
But it doesn't matter.

55:42.672 --> 55:44.424
Baby, no matter what...

55:44.507 --> 55:46.676
we will figure this out.

55:46.760 --> 55:49.137
What if they deport me back
to Santo Domingo?

55:49.220 --> 55:51.139
I haven't been there in 15 years...  Baby, I won't let them.

55:53.516 --> 55:56.478
Besides,
now that you're in Litchfield,

55:57.645 --> 55:59.939
at least I can visit, right?

56:02.734 --> 56:05.904
My love, at least here I can touch you.

56:06.446 --> 56:10.116
It's been so long since
I've been able to touch your skin.

56:10.533 --> 56:12.118
Mr. Zuniga?

56:12.869 --> 56:16.915
You got any other form of documentation
with you today

56:17.457 --> 56:20.543
I was told I didn't need that.
That my New York ID's enough.

56:20.627 --> 56:25.173
Right, but part of our protocol is
we cross-reference the immigration status

56:25.256 --> 56:27.967
with all the visitors
in and out of our facility.

56:28.510 --> 56:30.303
And yours came up flagged for us.

56:30.387 --> 56:32.847
Flagged

56:32.931 --> 56:36.017
Only asking some questions here, sir.
No need to raise your voice.

56:36.101 --> 56:37.685
He did not raise his voice.

56:37.769 --> 56:38.895
No, listen. Please, okay?

56:38.978 --> 56:42.107
I'm a legal permanent resident.
I've got a green card.

56:42.190 --> 56:43.149
Did I say step forward?

56:44.025 --> 56:47.195
You do not step forward
until I tell you to.

56:50.073 --> 56:51.533
Can you produce that card for me?

56:51.616 --> 56:55.453
I-- I didn't bring it with me.
It's expired. I'm waiting on a new one.

56:55.537 --> 56:57.163
But you just finished saying
you were legal.

56:57.247 --> 56:59.207
-I am.
-But if your green card's expired,

56:59.290 --> 57:02.168
then you're not actually
a legal permanent resident.

57:04.796 --> 57:07.924
Tell you what. We're gonna bring you
into processing as we sort this out.

57:08.007 --> 57:11.970
And if there's no problem, like you say,
there's not gonna be a problem.

57:12.053 --> 57:14.347
And if that's the case,
we'll have you on your way soon.

57:14.431 --> 57:15.890
-So, come on.
-No, stop.

57:15.974 --> 57:20.395
No, no, you can't do this! Hold on.
You can't do this! He didn't do anything!

57:35.160 --> 57:36.161
I'm scared. Yeah.

57:40.832 --> 57:42.584
No one even knows where we are.
