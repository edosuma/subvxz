00:23.690 --> 00:27.911
<i><font color="#808080">NEIL DeGRASSE TYSON :</font> The dream of becoming a citizen
of the cosmos was born here...</i>

00:28.070 --> 00:32.415
<i>...more than two millennia ago,
in the city of Alexandria...</i>

00:32.573 --> 00:38.456
<i>...named after and conceived
by its dead conqueror, Alexander the Great.</i>

00:38.622 --> 00:39.623
The Ptolemys...

00:39.790 --> 00:43.465
...the Greek kings who inherited the
Egyptian portion of Alexander's empire...

00:43.627 --> 00:48.599
...built this library
and its associated research institution.

00:48.757 --> 00:53.137
Rarely, if ever, before or since,
has there been a government...

00:53.303 --> 00:56.523
...that was willing to spend so much
of its gross national product...

00:56.682 --> 00:59.481
...on the acquisition of knowledge.

00:59.643 --> 01:02.237
And it paid off, big time.

01:02.896 --> 01:06.651
Every ship entering Alexandria's harbor
was searched...

01:06.817 --> 01:11.163
...not for contraband, but for books
that might be copied and stored here...

01:11.321 --> 01:14.996
...in what was then
the greatest library on Earth.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.506
Here, Eratosthenes,
one of the chief librarians...

01:24.668 --> 01:30.175
...accurately calculated the size
of the Earth and invented geography.

01:31.633 --> 01:33.761
Pythagoras.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.597
Hypatia.

01:37.639 --> 01:39.357
Euclid.

01:43.937 --> 01:47.237
Euclid set forth the
precepts of geometry...

01:47.399 --> 01:52.405
...in a textbook that remained in use
for 2300 years.

01:58.201 --> 02:00.704
The Old Testament Bible
comes down to us mainly...

02:00.871 --> 02:02.999
...from the Greek
translations made here.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.679
The original manuscripts
of the masterpieces

02:05.691 --> 02:08.217
of Greek comedy and
drama, poetry...

02:08.377 --> 02:10.847
...science, engineering...

02:11.006 --> 02:13.384
...medicine and history...

02:13.550 --> 02:18.351
...the total work product of the awakening
of ancient civilization, was kept here.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.275
Estimates vary on the total
number of scrolls.

02:22.434 --> 02:27.691
They range from 500,000
to nearly a million.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.824
And all of it...

02:29.983 --> 02:34.284
...all of this is but a tiny fraction
of the information that you have...

02:34.446 --> 02:37.370
...at your fingertips at this very moment.

02:39.910 --> 02:42.880
<i>The collective knowledge of our species...</i>

02:43.038 --> 02:45.962
<i>...our own electronic
Library of Alexandria...</i>

02:46.124 --> 02:49.224
<i>...may be accessed by
anyone who has a device</i>

02:49.236 --> 02:52.348
<i>and the interest and
the freedom to do so.</i>

02:52.506 --> 02:57.433
<i>This was not true in Alexandria,
where knowledge belonged to the elite.</i>

02:57.594 --> 02:59.596
<i>So in the fourth century A.D.,</i>

02:59.763 --> 03:05.236
<i>...when the mob came to destroy the library
and the genius of classical civilization...</i>

03:05.394 --> 03:08.648
<i>...there were not enough
people to defend it.</i>

03:08.814 --> 03:13.741
<i>What will happen
the next time the mob comes?</i>

04:52.959 --> 04:55.053
<font color="#808080">TYSON :</font>
We've come a long way together...

04:55.212 --> 04:58.261
...traveling from deep inside
the heart of an atom...

04:58.423 --> 05:00.892
...clear out to the cosmic horizon...

05:01.051 --> 05:05.056
...and from the beginning of time
to the distant future.

05:05.222 --> 05:07.816
I think we're ready
to perform an experiment.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.254
It's not the kind of experiment
that requires a laboratory.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.138
You can do it in your head.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.766
It's called a thought experiment.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.652
Pick a star, any one
of the hundreds of

05:46.664 --> 05:49.776
billions of stars in our
Milky Way Galaxy...

05:49.933 --> 05:54.860
...which is just one galaxy out of the
hundred billion in the known universe.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.523
How about that star?

05:56.690 --> 05:58.237
Or that one?

05:58.400 --> 06:00.448
Okay, this one.

06:00.610 --> 06:03.910
It's orbited by dozens
of planets and moons.

06:04.072 --> 06:07.997
Suppose, on one of them,
there lives an intelligent species...

06:08.159 --> 06:12.209
...one the ten million life-forms
on that planet.

06:12.372 --> 06:17.094
And there's a subgroup of that species
who believe they have it all figured out.

06:17.252 --> 06:23.476
Their world is the center of the universe,
a universe made for them.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.933
And that they know everything
they need to know about it.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.689
Their knowledge is complete.

06:29.973 --> 06:33.477
How seriously would you take their claim?

06:38.315 --> 06:41.990
Our ancestors believed
the universe was made for them.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.826
It was natural to assume
that we were at the center.

06:44.988 --> 06:49.289
After all, it looks like the sun
and stars all revolve around us.

06:49.451 --> 06:52.421
We still speak of the sun rising.

06:52.579 --> 06:58.677
The architecture of our language, myths and
dreams comes from that prescientific age.

06:58.835 --> 07:04.717
This is our planet as it was known then,
just before Columbus set sail.

07:04.883 --> 07:08.387
This first globe of the Earth
was cutting-edge...

07:08.553 --> 07:11.306
...when Martin Behaim
made it in 1492.

07:11.473 --> 07:12.520
Like everyone else...

07:12.682 --> 07:16.778
...he believed that the jigsaw puzzle
of geography was complete.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.817
There were three continents,
Europe, Africa and Asia.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.531
And only the great world ocean
in between.

07:23.860 --> 07:29.242
Behaim had no clue that North
and South America even existed.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.704
It's easy to feel smug, right?

07:34.412 --> 07:37.552
Well, the fact is
Martin Behaim knew

07:37.564 --> 07:40.715
infinitely more about
his world, the Earth...

07:40.877 --> 07:44.927
...than we know about ours, the universe.

07:45.090 --> 07:49.721
A recent lesson in humility
will serve to illustrate.

07:50.220 --> 07:56.523
<i>In 1912, Victor Hess made a series of
voyages into the sky above Austria...</i>

07:56.685 --> 08:00.861
<i>...and found the thing
that scientists love best...</i>

08:01.564 --> 08:07.071
<i>...a mystery that defied understanding
in terms of conventional scientific wisdom.</i>

08:09.531 --> 08:11.909
<i>And even today, a century later...</i>

08:12.075 --> 08:16.831
<i>...we are still searching for a complete
explanation of what Hess found.</i>

08:18.498 --> 08:23.095
<i>A new kind of energy had recently
been discovered, radioactivity.</i>

08:23.253 --> 08:26.382
<i>It was given off by certain elements,
like radium.</i>

08:26.965 --> 08:31.892
<i>But it was also found in the air,
even far away from radioactive rocks.</i>

08:32.053 --> 08:34.522
<i>It was everywhere.</i>

08:35.347 --> 08:37.942
<i>Where did this strange energy come from?</i>

08:38.101 --> 08:39.523
<i>No one knew.</i>

08:39.686 --> 08:43.190
<i>Hess suspected that it might come
from above the Earth.</i>

08:43.356 --> 08:47.907
<i>To test his hypothesis, he carried
radiation detectors high into the sky.</i>

08:49.154 --> 08:51.532
<i>During a risky ascent
in a hydrogen balloon...</i>

08:51.698 --> 08:54.542
<i>...he attained an altitude
of more than three miles.</i>

08:56.953 --> 09:00.253
<i>When he reached the thin, cold,
upper half of the atmosphere...</i>

09:11.134 --> 09:15.560
<i>...he found that the radiation was more
than twice as strong as on the ground.</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:19.142
<i>The radiation must be coming
from above.</i>

09:19.309 --> 09:22.313
<i>That's why its intensity
was weaker on the ground.</i>

09:22.479 --> 09:24.982
<i>The Earth's atmosphere
was absorbing most of it.</i>

09:26.483 --> 09:29.703
<i>Some thought that the radiation
might come from the sun.</i>

09:29.861 --> 09:35.413
<i>To test that idea, Hess timed one of his
ascents to coincide with a solar eclipse.</i>

09:43.458 --> 09:46.962
<i>But the eclipse had no effect
on the radiation.</i>

09:47.128 --> 09:52.350
<i>Hess also found that the radiation
was just as strong at night as in daylight.</i>

09:52.509 --> 09:56.184
<i>It was coming from above
but not from the sun.</i>

09:56.346 --> 09:59.520
<i>What Hess did not know
was that the solar wind...</i>

09:59.682 --> 10:01.684
<i>...doesn't move that quickly.</i>

10:01.851 --> 10:06.778
<i>And so, for the wrong reason,
he came to the right conclusion.</i>

10:06.940 --> 10:10.035
Hess had discovered cosmic rays...

10:10.193 --> 10:13.743
...showers of subatomic particles
that crisscross the universe...

10:13.905 --> 10:16.078
...at nearly the speed of light.

10:16.241 --> 10:20.667
Without the shielding effect
of the atmosphere, they would be lethal.

10:20.829 --> 10:26.211
Some cosmic rays can carry as much energy
as a bullet fired from a rifle.

10:26.376 --> 10:29.755
It would take decades
to trace those cosmic rays back...

10:29.921 --> 10:33.892
...to a death of unimaginable violence.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.616
<i>The cosmic rays that Victor Hess detected
in the skies above Austria...</i>

10:49.774 --> 10:51.822
<i>...posed a mystery to scientists.</i>

10:53.903 --> 10:57.908
<i>Radioactivity in minerals on Earth,
like uranium ore...</i>

10:58.074 --> 11:00.577
<i>...comes from the disintegration of atoms.</i>

11:00.743 --> 11:03.496
<i>But cosmic rays were of a different nature.</i>

11:04.581 --> 11:09.007
They were far more powerful
than anything known in Hess's world.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.925
Scientists wondered for two decades
what could possibly produce cosmic rays.

11:14.090 --> 11:20.473
Enter Fritz Zwicky, the most
brilliant man you've never heard of.

11:21.222 --> 11:25.853
<i>In 1933, he and a colleague discovered
that some stars flare up...</i>

11:26.019 --> 11:28.761
<i>...to become as bright
as their entire galaxy</i>

11:28.773 --> 11:31.526
<i>for a few weeks, before
fading out again.</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:35.616
Fritz Zwicky was the first person
to understand what just happened.

11:35.778 --> 11:40.249
He correctly surmised
that this is the way a massive star dies.

11:40.408 --> 11:43.127
It blows its guts out into space.

11:43.286 --> 11:47.291
<i>He called this kind of stellar death
a supernova.</i>

11:51.961 --> 11:54.976
And predicted that the
dying star would shrink

11:54.988 --> 11:58.014
from about a million
miles across to only 10.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.560
This corpse would be so dense
that a single grain of it...

12:02.722 --> 12:05.441
...would weigh as much
as the Great Pyramid in Egypt.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.605
It would consist almost entirely
of subatomic particles called neutrons.

12:09.771 --> 12:13.446
<i>So he named these bizarre objects
neutron stars.</i>

12:13.608 --> 12:16.327
<i>And 35 years after Zwicky predicted
their existence...</i>

12:16.861 --> 12:18.909
...astronomers began to find them.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.828
We call them pulsars when they spin rapidly
and emit regular pulses of radio energy.

12:23.993 --> 12:28.794
Supernovas and neutron stars could account
for a wide range of cosmic rays...

12:28.957 --> 12:31.676
<i>...but not the most energetic ones.</i>

12:31.834 --> 12:36.214
Nothing yet known to science
can explain them and we're fine with that.

12:36.381 --> 12:38.475
It's one of the things
I love about science.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.307
We don't have to pretend
we have all the answers.

12:41.678 --> 12:45.103
<i>Zwicky also came up with the idea
that the gravity of a galaxy...</i>

12:45.265 --> 12:48.940
<i>...warps the fabric of space around it
to act like a lens.</i>

12:49.102 --> 12:54.029
<i>This distorts and magnifies light from any
other galaxy lying directly behind it.</i>

12:54.190 --> 12:55.612
<i>So astronomers on Earth...</i>

12:55.775 --> 12:59.245
<i>...would see multiple images
of that same distant galaxy...</i>

12:59.404 --> 13:02.704
<i>...deformed as in a funhouse mirror.</i>

13:03.157 --> 13:08.539
<i>Forty years after this prediction,
we started finding them too.</i>

13:09.622 --> 13:13.377
And Zwicky made yet another discovery
back in the 1930s.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.221
<i>While studying the Coma cluster
of galaxies...</i>

13:17.380 --> 13:21.055
<i>...he noticed something funny
about the way they moved.</i>

13:21.676 --> 13:24.646
The galaxies were going way too fast...

13:24.804 --> 13:27.978
...so fast that they should've been
flying apart from each other...

13:28.141 --> 13:31.645
...because all the stars in all those
galaxies had far too little gravity...

13:31.811 --> 13:34.360
...to hold the cluster together.

13:34.522 --> 13:38.572
Zwicky thought that something else
must be binding them to each other.

13:38.735 --> 13:41.158
That mysterious missing component...

13:41.321 --> 13:45.918
...would have to weigh something like
5O times as much as the stars themselves.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.375
But no one paid much attention
to this wild notion.

13:49.537 --> 13:52.416
Just another one of Zwicky's crazy ideas.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.756
In our solar system,
the innermost planet, Mercury...

13:55.918 --> 13:58.762
...moves much faster than
the outermost one, Neptune.

13:58.921 --> 14:00.423
And that makes sense, right?

14:00.590 --> 14:04.060
The harder you push or pull
on something, the faster it goes.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.937
The sun's gravity weakens
with increasing distance...

14:07.096 --> 14:11.567
...so the planets that are farther
from the sun move more slowly.

14:11.726 --> 14:18.029
Everyone expected that the outermost stars
in a galaxy would act the same way.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.452
Most of the stars are concentrated
towards the center...

14:21.611 --> 14:24.660
...so their collective gravity
pulls on the other stars...

14:24.822 --> 14:28.042
...the same way the sun
pulls on the planets.

14:28.201 --> 14:33.082
<i>But in the 1970s, when astronomer Vera
Rubin studied the Andromeda Galaxy...</i>

14:33.247 --> 14:37.423
<i>...she discovered that the outer stars
obeyed no such rule.</i>

14:37.585 --> 14:40.054
Unlike the outer planets
in the solar system...

14:40.213 --> 14:43.843
...the outer stars in the galaxy
were all going at the same speed...

14:44.008 --> 14:45.931
...as the stars that were closer in.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.813
And they were moving way faster
than expected.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.600
"That's funny," Vera thought.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.986
"There must be something weird
about the Andromeda Galaxy."

14:55.144 --> 14:56.646
So she looked at another galaxy.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.944
Same story.

14:59.107 --> 15:00.154
And another.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.660
Vera studied 60 galaxies...

15:02.819 --> 15:06.494
...and found that all of them seemed
to be violating the Law of Gravity...

15:06.656 --> 15:08.499
...a core principle of physics.

15:09.659 --> 15:12.003
After some initial healthy skepticism...

15:12.161 --> 15:17.133
...her colleagues looked for themselves
and found that Vera was right.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.670
It's not that Isaac Newton
had gotten the Law of Gravity wrong.

15:20.837 --> 15:25.343
Vera Rubin had discovered that the gravity
of something massive and invisible...

15:25.508 --> 15:28.762
...was forcing the stars to go fast.

15:29.512 --> 15:34.860
And then, someone remembered
crazy old Fritz Zwicky...

15:35.852 --> 15:39.197
...and the unknown source of gravity
in the galaxy clusters...

15:39.355 --> 15:43.451
...that he called dark
matter, back in 1933.

15:49.615 --> 15:54.542
Vera Rubin had verified the existence
of a new, much larger cosmos.

15:54.704 --> 15:58.880
And just like the one we thought we knew,
it was filled with mystery.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.890
Dark matter is completely unobservable,
except for its gravitational effect...

16:05.047 --> 16:08.893
...which makes visible stars and galaxies
move faster.

16:09.051 --> 16:12.555
Its nature is another deep mystery.

16:12.722 --> 16:15.851
Rubin had provided the evidence
for an invisible universe...

16:16.017 --> 16:20.568
...nearly 10 times more massive
than the one we thought we knew.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.529
It was as if we had been standing
on the seashore at night...

16:23.691 --> 16:28.993
...mistakenly believing that the froth on
the waves was all there was to the ocean.

16:29.155 --> 16:36.004
Vera Rubin looked at the stars and realized
they were merely the foam on the waves...

16:36.162 --> 16:40.087
...and that the greatest part of the ocean
remained unknown.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.375
But wait.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.045
It gets crazier.

16:48.049 --> 16:52.179
<i>Our Milky Way galaxy,
a few hundred billion stars...</i>

16:52.345 --> 16:57.351
<i>...plus the clouds of gas and dust,
the stuff of once and future stars...</i>

16:57.517 --> 17:01.772
<i>...and about a hundred billion
other galaxies, all of that...</i>

17:01.938 --> 17:08.570
<i>...including those uncounted billions of
trillions of planets, moons, and comets...</i>

17:08.736 --> 17:13.287
<i>...amounts to only five percent
of what is actually there.</i>

17:13.449 --> 17:18.876
<i>Because there's a bigger unsolved mystery
than dark matter, dark energy...</i>

17:19.038 --> 17:23.464
<i>...which makes up even more of the cosmos
and drives its expansion.</i>

17:23.626 --> 17:27.096
<i>And it was Fritz Zwicky's supernovas
that lit the way...</i>

17:27.255 --> 17:29.804
<i>...to the revelation of its existence.</i>

17:32.301 --> 17:37.478
In one scenario,
a star consumes all of its nuclear fuel...

17:40.476 --> 17:44.151
<i>...then cools and suddenly collapses
under its own gravity.</i>

17:44.313 --> 17:48.068
<i>The star rebounds in a massive explosion...</i>

17:48.234 --> 17:52.831
<i>...leaving behind a neutron star
or a black hole.</i>

17:53.948 --> 17:57.998
Since the mass of the original star
can fall within a wide range...

17:58.160 --> 18:01.664
...its peak brightness as a supernova
can also vary widely.

18:01.831 --> 18:06.052
So you can't tell how far away it is
just from how bright it looks.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.008
A relatively nearby supernova...

18:08.170 --> 18:13.427
...might appear just as bright as one
that was more powerful but farther away.

18:13.593 --> 18:18.099
But there's another kind of supernova
that comes in only one strength.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.359
<i>It marks the violent grand
finale of a tango...</i>

18:21.517 --> 18:25.647
<i>...danced by a giant star and a dwarf.</i>

18:26.689 --> 18:29.533
<i>As the two stars orbit
closely around each other...</i>

18:29.692 --> 18:34.038
<i>...the giant sheds its outer layers of gas
onto the dwarf.</i>

18:34.614 --> 18:37.868
<i>When the added weight
becomes too much for it to bear...</i>

18:38.034 --> 18:42.961
<i>...the dwarf detonates
like a stupendous thermonuclear bomb.</i>

18:43.998 --> 18:46.842
<i>For a few weeks,
the brilliance of such a supernova...</i>

18:47.001 --> 18:51.256
<i>...rivals the combined light
of all the stars in its galaxy.</i>

18:51.422 --> 18:55.393
<i>This kind of supernova always has
the same maximum power output...</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:59.306
<i>...about five billion times brighter
than our sun.</i>

18:59.472 --> 19:03.522
<i>With big telescopes, we can see
them in galaxies very far away...</i>

19:03.684 --> 19:07.689
<i>...out toward the edge
of the observable universe.</i>

19:15.780 --> 19:18.875
<i>Because all such supernovas
have the same wattage...</i>

19:19.033 --> 19:21.445
<i>...they're ideal tools
for measuring distances</i>

19:21.457 --> 19:23.880
<i>to the farthest reaches
of the universe.</i>

19:24.038 --> 19:27.713
<i>We call them standard candles.</i>

19:31.504 --> 19:37.136
In 1929, Edwin Hubble discovered
that the universe is expanding.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.771
The distant galaxies are drifting away
from one another.

19:40.930 --> 19:45.151
Later, we learned that the expansion
began some 14 billion years ago...

19:45.309 --> 19:49.530
...with the explosive birth of
the universe, the Big Bang.

19:52.274 --> 19:55.448
Everybody assumed that the rate of
expansion would be slowing down...

19:55.611 --> 19:59.115
...due to the mutual pull of gravity
between all the parts of the universe.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.033
If there is enough dark matter...

20:01.200 --> 20:04.500
...its gravity would eventually bring
the expansion to a stop.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.711
And the universe
would then fall back on itself.

20:07.873 --> 20:12.549
In that case, everything would eventually
collapse in a big crunch.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.761
On the other hand,
if the universe had less dark matter...

20:15.923 --> 20:20.554
...the expansion would continue forever,
just getting slower and slower.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.060
<i>Two competing teams of astronomers...</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:26.351
<i>...were observing those supernovas
in distant galaxies.</i>

20:26.517 --> 20:30.818
<i>It turned out to be another one
of those that's-funny moments.</i>

20:30.980 --> 20:35.451
<i>In 1998, both teams independently came
to the same conclusion...</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:39.830
...the expansion isn't slowing down at all,
it's speeding up.

20:39.989 --> 20:44.039
This means the universe
will continue to expand forever.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.330
There seems to be a mysterious force
in the universe...

20:47.496 --> 20:50.295
...one that overwhelms gravity
on the grandest scale...

20:50.458 --> 20:52.961
...to push the cosmos apart.

20:53.127 --> 20:57.007
Most of the energy of the universe
is bound up in this unknown force.

20:57.173 --> 20:59.722
We call it dark energy.

20:59.884 --> 21:05.891
But that name, like dark matter,
is merely a code word for our ignorance.

21:06.056 --> 21:08.400
It's okay not to know all the answers.

21:08.559 --> 21:12.780
It's better to admit our ignorance than
to believe answers that might be wrong.

21:12.938 --> 21:17.865
Pretending to know everything closes the
door to finding out what's really there.

21:19.570 --> 21:25.077
<i>Tonight, our ships sail
into even more exotic waters.</i>

21:25.242 --> 21:27.165
<i>Come with me.</i>

21:37.254 --> 21:40.229
<i>Only two of our ships
have ventured into the</i>

21:40.241 --> 21:43.227
<i>great dark ocean of
interstellar space.</i>

21:43.385 --> 21:46.685
<i>The longest odyssey in all of history...</i>

21:46.847 --> 21:50.067
<i>...was launched back in 1977...</i>

21:50.226 --> 21:53.901
<i>...NASA's Voyager 1 and 2.</i>

21:54.814 --> 21:59.035
<i>The Voyagers move about 40,000 miles
an hour.</i>

21:59.193 --> 22:03.573
<i>They gave us our first close-up look
at Jupiter's Great Red Spot.</i>

22:03.781 --> 22:07.081
<i>A hurricane three times
the size of Earth...</i>

22:07.243 --> 22:10.747
<i>...and one that's been raging
since at least 1644...</i>

22:10.913 --> 22:12.460
<i>...when it was first observed.</i>

22:12.623 --> 22:16.423
<i>For all we know,
it could be thousands of years old.</i>

22:16.585 --> 22:21.432
<i>The Voyagers discovered the first active
volcano on another world...</i>

22:21.590 --> 22:23.763
<i>...on Jupiter's moon lo.</i>

22:25.386 --> 22:29.141
<i>And an ocean beneath the icy surface
of the moon Europa...</i>

22:32.935 --> 22:37.611
<i>...with at least twice as much water
as we have here on Earth.</i>

22:39.525 --> 22:43.120
<i>The Voyagers dared to fly
across Saturn's rings...</i>

22:43.279 --> 22:47.250
<i>...and revealed that they were made
of hundreds of thin bands...</i>

22:47.408 --> 22:49.081
<i>...of orbiting snowballs.</i>

22:52.288 --> 22:54.541
<i>On Saturn's giant moon Titan...</i>

22:54.707 --> 22:59.087
<i>...Voyager detected an atmosphere
four times denser than Earth's.</i>

22:59.253 --> 23:03.679
<i>That hinted at the existence
of hydrocarbon seas on Titan...</i>

23:03.841 --> 23:06.469
<i>...which we later confirmed.</i>

23:07.803 --> 23:13.401
<i>Voyager 2 gave us our first portrait
of the outermost planet, Neptune...</i>

23:14.268 --> 23:18.444
<i>...where the winds roar
at a thousand miles per hour...</i>

23:19.315 --> 23:21.033
<i>...and its moon Triton...</i>

23:21.191 --> 23:24.240
<i>...with geysers of boiling nitrogen...</i>

23:24.403 --> 23:27.577
<i>...shoot five miles high.</i>

23:30.117 --> 23:34.497
<i>Voyager successfully completed its mission
of discovery to the outer planets...</i>

23:34.663 --> 23:39.294
<i>...but its odyssey into the darkness
was just beginning.</i>

23:40.920 --> 23:42.763
Thirty-five years after its launch...

23:42.922 --> 23:48.099
<i>Voyager 1 became the first of our
spacecraft to enter an uncharted realm.</i>

23:49.303 --> 23:53.854
<i>The sun is constantly shooting out streams
of charged particles in all directions...</i>

23:54.016 --> 23:56.394
<i>...moving at a million miles an hour.</i>

23:56.560 --> 24:01.031
<i>This solar wind
blows a vast magnetic bubble...</i>

24:01.190 --> 24:05.286
<i>...our heliosphere
that extends beyond the outer planets.</i>

24:05.444 --> 24:09.995
<i>It pushes out against the thin gas
of interstellar space.</i>

24:10.157 --> 24:14.378
<i>There's a border where one ends
and the other begins.</i>

24:14.536 --> 24:16.664
<i>Voyager 1 reported back to Earth...</i>

24:16.830 --> 24:19.299
<i>...that its detectors
were being pummeled...</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:21.460
<i>...by more and more cosmic rays.</i>

24:21.627 --> 24:25.552
<i>Until then, we didn't know
where the interstellar ocean began.</i>

24:25.714 --> 24:30.845
<i>Voyager 1 pressed on past a boundary
we had never crossed before.</i>

24:31.011 --> 24:34.891
<i>The heliosphere shields us
from most of the deadly cosmic rays.</i>

24:35.057 --> 24:39.233
<i>When stormy solar winds blow,
this zone of protection grows...</i>

24:39.395 --> 24:41.443
<i>...in calm solar weather, it shrinks.</i>

24:41.605 --> 24:45.576
<i>When a star goes supernova
in our galactic neighborhood...</i>

24:46.694 --> 24:48.913
...the debris from the exploded star...

24:49.321 --> 24:52.416
...pushes the heliosphere
back towards the sun.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.498
If it's strong enough to push it back
to Earth's orbit...

24:55.995 --> 25:00.546
...our planet gets a radioactive
bath of supernova debris.

25:01.083 --> 25:03.757
Luckily, this doesn't happen very often.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.139
<i>The last one was perhaps
2 million years ago.</i>

25:07.297 --> 25:10.096
A neighboring star explodes
a million years...

25:10.259 --> 25:14.389
...before there's even such a thing
as the human species.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.603
How can we possibly know this?

25:16.765 --> 25:22.147
Because the dying star left its traces
miles below the surface of the ocean.

25:22.312 --> 25:24.280
Manganese nodules...

25:24.440 --> 25:26.442
...small rocks like this one...

25:26.608 --> 25:30.283
...are scattered over much
of the deep sea floor.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.624
They grow very slowly.

25:33.782 --> 25:38.288
I'm talking a millimeter
in a million years...

25:38.996 --> 25:41.545
<i>...layer upon layer.</i>

25:42.458 --> 25:45.678
<i>These nodules grow in partnership
with bacteria...</i>

25:45.836 --> 25:49.932
<i>...by taking up minerals
dissolved in the seawater.</i>

25:50.466 --> 25:54.312
<i>A supernova produces a radioactive form
of iron...</i>

25:54.470 --> 25:58.316
<i>...unlike anything made
by natural processes on Earth.</i>

25:58.474 --> 26:01.023
Researchers found telltale
traces of this iron...

26:01.185 --> 26:05.110
...in a thin layer below the surface
of the manganese nodules.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.900
They used the known rate of growth
of the nodules...

26:08.067 --> 26:09.193
...to date that layer...

26:09.359 --> 26:14.661
...and to connect it to the fate of a star
that perished eons ago.

26:16.241 --> 26:19.245
The difference between seeing nothing
but a pebble...

26:19.411 --> 26:23.757
...and reading the history of the cosmos
inscribed inside it...

26:23.916 --> 26:26.169
...is science.

26:28.170 --> 26:32.175
The interstellar ocean is dark
and deep.

26:32.341 --> 26:36.016
Out here, the sun is just
the brightest star in the sky.

26:36.178 --> 26:39.022
Yet the Voyagers maintain
their regular communications...

26:39.181 --> 26:41.479
...with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory...

26:41.642 --> 26:44.571
...talking back and forth
across the light-hours

26:44.583 --> 26:47.524
that separate these ships
from their home port.

26:47.689 --> 26:53.867
No other objects touched by human hands
have ever ventured this far from home.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.706
Even after they lose their ability
to respond to our command...

27:03.872 --> 27:08.878
...the last and, by far, the longest phase
of the Voyager mission will begin.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.890
Back in 1979,
when both Voyagers rounded Jupiter...

27:21.056 --> 27:23.132
...its massive gravity
acted as a slingshot,

27:23.144 --> 27:25.232
flinging them out of
the solar system...

27:25.394 --> 27:29.991
...to travel among the stars of our galaxy
for a billion years.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.743
Carl Sagan recognized
that the Voyager mission...

27:32.901 --> 27:37.577
...offered two free tickets
to something approaching eternity.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.414
He assembled a small team
to create a message to any civilization...

27:41.577 --> 27:46.174
...that might, one day,
encounter the derelict spacecraft.

27:49.710 --> 27:54.432
Twenty-six centuries ago,
the Assyrian king Esarhaddon wrote:

27:54.590 --> 27:59.562
"I had monuments made of bronze
and inscriptions of baked clay.

27:59.720 --> 28:03.850
I left them in the foundations
for future times."

28:04.016 --> 28:07.816
These hieroglyphics continue
that ancient tradition.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.276
They are inscribed on the
cover of a message...

28:10.439 --> 28:15.991
...designed to be read
by the beings of other worlds and times.

28:16.612 --> 28:19.741
What could we possibly have in common
with an alien civilization...

28:19.907 --> 28:22.581
...with its own separate
evolutionary history...

28:22.743 --> 28:28.671
...and one so far advanced beyond us
that they can patrol interstellar space?

28:28.832 --> 28:30.084
One thing at least.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.921
A universal language...
...science.

28:35.172 --> 28:37.300
It's hard to break the bonds of gravity.

28:37.466 --> 28:42.563
You can only sail the cosmic seas
if you speak mathematics and physics.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.934
Hydrogen is the most common element
in the universe.

28:46.099 --> 28:47.817
The electron in a hydrogen atom...

28:47.976 --> 28:51.480
...flips the direction of its spin
at a constant rate or frequency.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.864
Hydrogen atoms are like
tiny natural clocks.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.028
Tick. Tock.

28:58.195 --> 29:02.166
Now we have a unit of time in common
with the extraterrestrials.

29:02.532 --> 29:05.752
This will come in handy when we get
to the next level of the message.

29:05.911 --> 29:08.585
Here's our return address in space.

29:08.747 --> 29:11.784
Pulsars are rapidly-spinning
neutron stars

29:11.796 --> 29:14.845
that give off regular
bursts of radio waves.

29:15.003 --> 29:16.971
You can set your clock by them.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.842
The sun is at the center of this diagram...

29:20.008 --> 29:23.603
...and the lines point to
the 14 nearest pulsars.

29:23.762 --> 29:27.357
A simple code labels each pulsar
with its unique frequency...

29:27.516 --> 29:31.111
...using the tick tock of
the hydrogen atom as the unit of time.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.898
So alien astronomers
could use this diagram...

29:34.064 --> 29:38.035
...to locate the home star of the Voyager
spacecraft in our galaxy.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.323
They could also tell how long ago
the spacecraft was launched.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.536
And that's important...

29:43.699 --> 29:46.441
...because the Voyager
record has a projected

29:46.453 --> 29:49.206
shelf life of a
thousand million years.

a billion years ago?

31:37.229 --> 31:41.826
Most of Earth's land was amassed
into a supercontinent called Rodinia.

31:41.983 --> 31:45.533
It was a barren desert,
no animals, no plants.

31:45.695 --> 31:46.742
A billion years ago...

31:46.905 --> 31:50.159
...there wasn't oxygen in our
atmosphere to form an ozone layer...

31:50.325 --> 31:55.673
...and without it, ultraviolet radiation
prevented life from colonizing the land.

31:55.831 --> 32:00.382
Rodinia probably looked more like Mars
than present-day Earth.

32:00.669 --> 32:05.800
<i>The giant world ocean produced huge
rainstorms, causing flooding and erosion.</i>

32:05.966 --> 32:07.058
<i>Glaciers formed...</i>

32:07.217 --> 32:12.144
<i>...and their slow but relentless movements
carved the land into new shapes.</i>

32:12.556 --> 32:15.560
<i>Single-celled organisms
dominated the oceans...</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:19.355
<i>...but some existed in colonies
called microbial mats...</i>

32:19.521 --> 32:23.947
<i>...and the first multicellular organisms
would soon evolve.</i>

32:24.109 --> 32:26.157
And a billion years from now...

32:26.319 --> 32:27.912
...what will Earth be like...

32:28.071 --> 32:30.790
...long after our cities,
the Egyptian pyramids...

32:30.949 --> 32:34.044
...the Rocky Mountains
have all been eroded to dust?

32:34.202 --> 32:39.379
There are few things we can say with
confidence about such a far distant time.

32:43.462 --> 32:45.510
The only thing we can say for sure...

32:46.006 --> 32:49.306
...is that Earth as we know it
will be so changed...

32:49.468 --> 32:52.893
...that we would scarcely recognize it
as home.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.316
But even a thousand million years
from now...

32:56.475 --> 32:58.523
...something of who we were...

32:58.685 --> 33:02.155
...and the music that we made
in that long-ago spring...

33:02.314 --> 33:04.316
...will live on.

33:09.446 --> 33:10.914
<i>In that distant future...</i>

33:11.072 --> 33:16.670
<i>...our sun will have completed another four
orbits around the center of the galaxy...</i>

33:23.877 --> 33:29.099
<i>...and the Voyagers will have ventured
far from the sun.</i>

33:31.843 --> 33:34.562
Carl Sagan was a member
of Voyager's imaging team...

33:34.721 --> 33:39.147
...and it was his idea
that Voyager take one last picture.

33:39.559 --> 33:40.776
A generation before...

33:40.936 --> 33:43.530
...an astronaut on the last Apollo flight
to the Moon...

33:43.688 --> 33:46.191
...had taken a picture
of the whole Earth...

33:46.358 --> 33:49.737
...the planet as a world without borders.

33:49.903 --> 33:53.282
It became an icon of a new consciousness.

33:53.448 --> 33:56.952
Carl realized the next
step in this process.

33:57.118 --> 34:01.419
<i>He convinced NASA to turn the Voyager 1
camera back towards Earth...</i>

34:01.581 --> 34:03.834
...when the spacecraft
went beyond Neptune...

34:04.000 --> 34:06.298
...for one last look homeward...

34:06.461 --> 34:08.054
...at what he called...

34:08.213 --> 34:10.556
...the Pale Blue Dot.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.023
<i><font color="#808080">CARL SAGAN :</font>
That's here.</i>

34:18.181 --> 34:19.524
<i>That's home.</i>

34:19.683 --> 34:21.230
<i>That's us.</i>

34:21.393 --> 34:22.565
On it...

34:22.726 --> 34:25.900
<i>...everyone you love, everyone you know...</i>

34:26.063 --> 34:27.782
<i>...everyone you ever heard of...</i>

34:27.940 --> 34:30.659
<i>...every human being who ever was...</i>

34:30.819 --> 34:33.288
<i>...lived out their lives.</i>

34:33.446 --> 34:36.574
<i>The aggregate of our joy and suffering...</i>

34:36.741 --> 34:41.588
<i>...thousands of confident religions,
ideologies, and economic doctrines...</i>

34:41.746 --> 34:43.965
<i>...every hunter and forager...</i>

34:44.123 --> 34:49.130
<i>...every hero and coward, every creator
and destroyer of civilization...</i>

34:49.295 --> 34:51.344
<i>...every king and peasant...</i>

34:51.505 --> 34:55.181
<i>...every young couple in love,
every mother and father...</i>

34:55.342 --> 34:58.973
<i>...hopeful child, inventor and explorer...</i>

34:59.139 --> 35:02.518
<i>...every teacher of morals,
every corrupt politician...</i>

35:02.684 --> 35:06.780
<i>...every superstar, every supreme leader...</i>

35:06.938 --> 35:10.784
<i>...every saint and sinner
in the history of our species...</i>

35:10.942 --> 35:12.410
<i>...lived there...</i>

35:12.569 --> 35:14.196
<i>...on a mote of dust...</i>

35:14.362 --> 35:17.582
<i>...suspended in a sunbeam.</i>

35:17.741 --> 35:21.871
<i>The Earth is a very small stage...</i>

35:22.037 --> 35:25.883
<i>...in a vast, cosmic arena.</i>

35:26.041 --> 35:28.885
<i>Think of the rivers of blood...</i>

35:29.044 --> 35:32.719
<i>...spilled by all those
generals and emperors...</i>

35:32.881 --> 35:38.058
<i>...so that in glory and triumph they could
become the momentary masters...</i>

35:38.219 --> 35:41.723
<i>...of a fraction of a dot.</i>

35:41.890 --> 35:44.564
<i>Think of the endless cruelties visited...</i>

35:44.726 --> 35:47.980
<i>...by the inhabitants
of one corner of this pixel...</i>

35:48.146 --> 35:53.027
<i>...on the scarcely distinguishable
inhabitants of some other corner.</i>

35:53.193 --> 35:56.072
<i>How frequent their misunderstandings...</i>

35:56.237 --> 35:59.036
<i>...how eager they are
to kill one another...</i>

35:59.199 --> 36:02.419
<i>...how fervent their hatreds.</i>

36:02.911 --> 36:05.084
<i>Our posturings. ..</i>

36:05.246 --> 36:08.090
<i>...our imagined self-importance...</i>

36:08.249 --> 36:12.129
<i>...the delusion that we have some
privileged position in the universe...</i>

36:12.295 --> 36:17.426
<i>...are challenged by this
point of pale light.</i>

36:17.676 --> 36:19.394
<i>Our planet...</i>

36:19.552 --> 36:21.429
<i>...is a lonely speck...</i>

36:21.596 --> 36:25.226
<i>...in the great, enveloping cosmic dark.</i>

36:25.392 --> 36:28.111
<i>In our obscurity...</i>

36:28.269 --> 36:30.738
<i>...in all this vastness...</i>

36:30.897 --> 36:34.652
<i>...there is no hint that help
will come from elsewhere...</i>

36:34.818 --> 36:37.697
<i>...to save us from ourselves.</i>

36:37.862 --> 36:42.208
<i>The Earth is the only world known so far
to harbor life.</i>

36:42.367 --> 36:45.621
<i>There is nowhere else,
at least in the near future...</i>

36:45.787 --> 36:48.461
<i>...to which our species could migrate.</i>

36:48.623 --> 36:49.966
<i>Visit?</i>

36:50.125 --> 36:51.172
<i>Yes.</i>

36:51.334 --> 36:53.211
<i>Settle?</i>

36:53.378 --> 36:54.425
<i>Not yet.</i>

36:54.587 --> 36:57.090
<i>Like it or not, for the moment...</i>

36:57.257 --> 37:00.636
<i>...the Earth is where we make our stand.</i>

37:00.844 --> 37:07.773
<i>It has been said that astronomy is a
humbling and character-building experience.</i>

37:07.934 --> 37:13.156
<i>There is perhaps no better demonstration
of the folly of human conceits...</i>

37:13.314 --> 37:16.363
<i>...than this distant image.</i>

37:16.860 --> 37:17.952
<i>To me...</i>

37:18.111 --> 37:22.992
<i>...it underscores our responsibility
to deal more kindly with one another...</i>

37:23.158 --> 37:27.538
<i>...and to preserve and cherish
the Pale Blue Dot...</i>

37:27.704 --> 37:31.334
<i>...the only home we've ever known.</i>

37:37.964 --> 37:42.185
<i><font color="#808080">TYSON :</font> How did we, tiny creatures
living on that speck of dust...</i>

37:42.343 --> 37:45.392
<i>...ever manage to figure out
how to send spacecraft...</i>

37:45.555 --> 37:48.229
<i>...out among the stars of the Milky Way?</i>

37:48.391 --> 37:52.612
<i>Only a few centuries ago,
a mere second of cosmic time...</i>

37:52.771 --> 37:56.150
<i>...we knew nothing of where
or when we were.</i>

37:56.316 --> 37:58.535
<i>Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos...</i>

37:58.693 --> 38:01.037
<i>...we inhabited a kind of prison.</i>

38:01.196 --> 38:05.747
<i>A tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.</i>

38:09.329 --> 38:12.549
<i>How did we escape from the prison?</i>

38:13.333 --> 38:20.217
<i>It was the work of generations of searchers
who took five simple rules to heart.</i>

38:24.385 --> 38:26.228
<i>Question authority.</i>

38:26.387 --> 38:29.561
<i>No idea is true,
just because someone says so...</i>

38:29.724 --> 38:32.193
<i>...including me.</i>

38:32.894 --> 38:35.522
<i>Think for yourself.</i>

38:38.566 --> 38:41.194
<i>Question yourself.</i>

38:42.153 --> 38:45.748
<i>Don't believe anything
just because you want to.</i>

38:45.907 --> 38:49.252
<i>Believing something doesn't make it so.</i>

38:49.410 --> 38:54.917
<i>Test ideas by the evidence gained
from observation and experiment.</i>

38:56.209 --> 39:00.680
<i>If a favorite idea fails a
well-designed test, it's wrong.</i>

39:00.839 --> 39:02.261
<i>Get over it.</i>

39:03.550 --> 39:07.180
<i>Follow the evidence, wherever it leads.</i>

39:08.721 --> 39:12.191
<i>If you have no evidence, reserve judgment.</i>

39:12.559 --> 39:15.233
<i>And perhaps the most
important rule of all...</i>

39:15.645 --> 39:18.194
<i>...remember, you could be wrong.</i>

39:18.356 --> 39:22.111
<i>Even the best scientists have been wrong
about some things.</i>

39:22.277 --> 39:24.405
<i>Newton, Einstein...</i>

39:24.571 --> 39:27.415
<i>...and every other great
scientist in history...</i>

39:28.074 --> 39:29.917
<i>...they all made mistakes.</i>

39:30.076 --> 39:32.920
<i>Of course they did, they were human.</i>

39:33.162 --> 39:37.258
<i>Science is a way to keep
from fooling ourselves...</i>

39:37.417 --> 39:39.511
<i>...and each other.</i>

39:40.295 --> 39:43.299
<i>Have scientists known sin?</i>

39:45.758 --> 39:47.101
<i>Of course.</i>

39:47.260 --> 39:53.017
<i>We have misused science, just as we have
every other tool at our disposal...</i>

39:53.182 --> 39:58.905
<i>...and that's why we can't afford to leave
it in the hands of a powerful few.</i>

39:59.147 --> 40:01.775
<i>The more science belongs to all of us...</i>

40:01.941 --> 40:05.161
<i>...the less likely it is to be misused.</i>

40:07.322 --> 40:12.123
<i>These values undermine the appeals
of fanaticism and ignorance.</i>

40:12.285 --> 40:14.083
<i>And after all...</i>

40:14.245 --> 40:19.627
<i>...the universe is mostly dark,
dotted by islands of light.</i>

40:20.501 --> 40:22.219
Learning the age of the Earth...

40:22.378 --> 40:25.507
...or the distance to the stars
or how life evolves...

40:25.673 --> 40:27.675
...what difference does that make?

40:27.842 --> 40:32.268
Well, part of it depends on how big
a universe you're willing to live in.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.307
Some of us like it small.

40:34.474 --> 40:35.691
That's fine.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.477
Understandable.

40:37.644 --> 40:39.112
But I like it big.

40:39.270 --> 40:44.026
And when I take all of this into my heart
and my mind, I'm uplifted by it.

40:44.192 --> 40:47.822
And when I have that feeling,
I want to know that it's real...

40:47.987 --> 40:51.537
...that it's not just something
happening inside my own head...

40:51.699 --> 40:53.622
...because it matters what's true...

40:53.785 --> 40:56.413
...and our imagination is nothing...

40:56.579 --> 41:00.254
...compared with nature's awesome reality.

41:03.711 --> 41:07.682
<i>I want to know what's
in those dark places...</i>

41:08.341 --> 41:11.891
<i>...and what happened before the big bang.</i>

41:13.554 --> 41:18.856
<i>I want to know what lies beyond
the cosmic horizon and how life began.</i>

41:19.018 --> 41:25.196
<i>Are there other places in the cosmos where
matter and energy have become alive...</i>

41:26.067 --> 41:28.411
<i>...and aware?</i>

41:35.702 --> 41:38.706
<i>I want to know my ancestors, all of them.</i>

41:38.871 --> 41:43.126
<i>I want to be a good, strong link
in the chain of generations.</i>

41:43.292 --> 41:48.389
<i>I want to protect my children
and the children of ages to come.</i>

41:48.548 --> 41:54.351
We, who embody the local eyes and ears
and thoughts and feelings of the cosmos...

41:54.512 --> 41:57.436
...we've begun to learn the story
of our origins...

41:57.598 --> 42:01.523
...star stuff contemplating
the evolution of matter...

42:01.686 --> 42:05.782
...tracing that long path by which
it arrived at consciousness.

42:05.940 --> 42:08.238
We and the other living things
on this planet...

42:08.401 --> 42:12.952
...carry a legacy of cosmic evolution
spanning billions of years.

42:13.114 --> 42:15.116
If we take that knowledge to heart...

42:15.491 --> 42:18.836
...if we come to know and love nature
as it really is...

42:18.995 --> 42:21.714
...then we will surely be remembered
by our descendants...

42:21.873 --> 42:24.922
...as good, strong links
in the chain of life.

42:25.084 --> 42:28.133
And our children will continue
this sacred searching...

42:28.463 --> 42:32.093
...seeing for us as we have seen
for those who came before...

42:32.258 --> 42:35.387
...discovering wonders
yet undreamt of...

42:35.553 --> 42:37.931
...in the cosmos.
