<i>Amy: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager... </i>

00:03.543 --> 00:05.279
I know Amy wants to go
to school in New York,

00:05.295 --> 00:07.946
and I don't think she wants
to get married before she goes.

00:07.969 --> 00:09.455
How the hell are you going to
live in two different cities

00:09.471 --> 00:10.691
and be parents to a three-year-old?

00:10.699 --> 00:13.068
I'm gonna get algebra removed
from the school curriculum.

00:13.076 --> 00:15.532
- You don't want to go to New York.
- Maybe not this year.

00:15.547 --> 00:18.191
The school I visited
in Utah, it was amazing.

00:18.214 --> 00:19.739
I could just transfer and go with you.

00:19.747 --> 00:20.639
Did you have a good time?

00:20.662 --> 00:22.062
Wasn't really there to have a good time.

00:22.078 --> 00:23.501
I notice you're not
wearing your wedding band

00:23.517 --> 00:24.432
or your engagement ring.

00:24.463 --> 00:25.496
If I could get that apartment,

00:25.488 --> 00:27.154
I would definitely go to Hudson University.

00:27.185 --> 00:28.882
You are not going to New York.
The whole thing is ridiculous.

00:28.898 --> 00:31.471
If I don't go now, I may
never have this chance again.

00:31.518 --> 00:33.183
That is not a compliment,

00:33.199 --> 00:34.755
that a woman looks like a stripper.

00:34.778 --> 00:36.663
You are good looking enough to
take your clothes off for money.

00:36.655 --> 00:38.978
You were pretending to be married
to me and you stole my wedding rings?

00:38.993 --> 00:41.831
Do not marry someone you're
not madly in love with.

00:41.832 --> 00:43.896
You're trying to find a
way to break up with Jack.

00:43.920 --> 00:47.275
You are not breaking up
with him until I say you are.

00:47.283 --> 00:49.222
You think she just doesn't
want to be married to me?

00:49.269 --> 00:51.068
I think she feels trapped.

00:51.076 --> 00:52.585
Let's set a date.

00:53.766 --> 00:56.472
So let's stop kidding
around and make it official.

00:58.184 --> 00:59.936
Hi, mom.

01:04.363 --> 01:06.475
What happened to the wallpaper?

01:06.595 --> 01:08.015
Who needs wallpaper?

01:08.039 --> 01:11.973
Before it looked like a home.
Now it looks like an institution.

01:12.093 --> 01:14.444
Who picked out the paint color?

01:15.093 --> 01:16.446
Me.

01:16.566 --> 01:18.832
And I painted it just the
way Kathleen wanted it.

01:18.952 --> 01:21.772
Like a dog in heat marking his territory.

01:21.804 --> 01:24.150
- Woof.
- What happened to your second wife?

01:24.270 --> 01:25.346
Oh. She's gay.

01:25.354 --> 01:26.551
She's gay?

01:26.574 --> 01:29.109
She sure is. And proud of
it. And I'm proud of her.

01:29.132 --> 01:31.283
Oh really? What are you
wearing to the parade?

01:31.290 --> 01:33.465
Anything I want. And I'm
taking Kathleen with me.

01:33.505 --> 01:35.460
Hoping to turn her gay too?

01:35.436 --> 01:39.386
You can't turn straight into gay anymore
than you can turn a witch into a warlock.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.630
Actually, I think you can do both,

01:41.654 --> 01:44.947
but I'm not interested in
discussing conversion therapy

01:44.939 --> 01:47.489
or transsexual surgery with you.

01:47.535 --> 01:49.459
It's called gender reassignment surgery.

01:49.579 --> 01:51.094
Sit down, I'll get you a drink.

01:51.149 --> 01:52.689
Oh that's right, you don't drink.

01:52.809 --> 01:55.114
You want a cup of coffee? Oh that's right,

01:55.145 --> 01:56.599
you don't drink caffeine.

01:56.811 --> 01:58.140
How 'bout a game of cards?

01:58.164 --> 02:00.595
What am I saying? Cards are
at the instrument of the devil!

02:00.642 --> 02:02.284
George, please.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.239
What? Your mother has a sense of humor.

02:04.359 --> 02:06.210
Don't you Victor Victoria?

02:06.719 --> 02:09.964
Can I get you some cookies ' and warm
milk before you go to bed, mother?

02:09.995 --> 02:11.559
Did you make the cookies?

02:11.560 --> 02:12.529
Yes, I did.

02:12.649 --> 02:14.461
Oh, no thank you.

02:15.016 --> 02:16.385
I'll have some.

02:18.880 --> 02:20.499
So what dragged you out of hiding?

02:20.619 --> 02:21.969
I haven't been hiding,

02:21.977 --> 02:24.659
I've been in the same house
that I've been in for 40 years.

02:24.779 --> 02:27.858
Kathleen knows where I
live. And she has my number.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.329
When's the last time
you and Kathleen talked?

02:30.525 --> 02:33.043
I believe it was when Marshall passed away.

02:33.163 --> 02:36.352
- Oh, right. So you don't know about...
- Ooh...

02:36.406 --> 02:38.244
Here are your cookies, dear.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.956
(Mutters) Dear.

02:40.261 --> 02:42.677
- We don't need to mention.
- Mention what?

02:44.344 --> 02:46.338
About your not coming to the funeral.

02:46.369 --> 02:48.926
You couldn't get it together for
your daughter, your grandkids?

02:49.130 --> 02:50.749
Don't want to tell her about the grandkids?

02:50.741 --> 02:52.923
(Sighs) No. Not right now.

02:52.977 --> 02:54.244
So, how's dad?

02:54.364 --> 02:56.700
- Dead.
- Yes. Dad?

02:56.820 --> 02:59.627
Dead. He's dead.

03:00.978 --> 03:01.854
What?

03:02.269 --> 03:04.733
My father died and you didn't even call me?

03:04.780 --> 03:06.680
He's dead to me. (Sighs with relief)

03:06.702 --> 03:08.666
He's still alive and well, somewhere.

03:08.690 --> 03:10.586
- Somewhere?
- He left.

03:10.598 --> 03:12.991
(Laughs) You? He left you?

03:13.030 --> 03:13.898
How'd that happen?

03:13.921 --> 03:15.165
Oh, shut up, George.

03:15.180 --> 03:17.230
Is that why you're here,
mom? To let me know about dad?

03:17.214 --> 03:18.176
No.

03:18.731 --> 03:22.283
I'm here because I'm going to
need someone to take care of me.

03:22.649 --> 03:24.854
I got the name of a rattlesnake wrangler.

03:25.097 --> 03:26.254
We'll call him.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.092
(Crickets chirping outside)

03:28.116 --> 03:29.557
Hi.

03:30.149 --> 03:31.854
Grandma?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.451
This is who he left the restaurant with?

03:34.474 --> 03:36.211
- Yeah.
- Grace!

03:36.234 --> 03:39.425
How are you? And what are
you doing in that get up?

03:39.472 --> 03:42.404
That's hardly appropriate
for someone your age.

03:42.524 --> 03:44.360
- Hi.
- Who are you?

03:44.399 --> 03:47.331
Well, um... I'm Jack.

03:47.988 --> 03:49.302
I'm Grace's...

03:50.092 --> 03:51.479
fiancÃ©.

I can't wait to see how you
do on the algebra test today.

04:26.546 --> 04:28.107
I bet you do really well.

04:28.139 --> 04:31.376
I'm not going to abandon my campaign
to get algebra removed from the required

04:31.384 --> 04:32.941
course list, no matter how I do.

04:32.972 --> 04:36.670
I think just being interested in the
subject, pro or con, may help you.

04:36.897 --> 04:40.284
Just being interested in something does
not mean you're suddenly good at it.

04:40.404 --> 04:41.762
And I'm not interested.

04:41.809 --> 04:44.882
Okay, okay I'll drop it, but...

04:44.922 --> 04:46.962
what subjects do you really like?

04:46.963 --> 04:48.636
Other than music?

04:48.756 --> 04:50.787
I don't know, free period.

04:52.242 --> 04:54.541
What do you use that
time in free period for?

04:54.661 --> 04:57.262
What do you think about when
you have an hour to think?

04:57.504 --> 04:59.537
You mostly.

04:59.944 --> 05:03.056
You know, one day you're going to
have to make a living at something.

05:03.260 --> 05:05.637
The more you know, the more
options you're going to have.

05:05.684 --> 05:08.164
You should use high school as a
way to find out what interests you,

05:08.179 --> 05:09.357
outside of me,

05:09.477 --> 05:11.592
then you'll know what you
want to study in college.

05:11.627 --> 05:14.380
I have to go, you've got hours
before that test, so... (Sighs)

05:14.427 --> 05:16.461
look at the material
again, just to refresh,

05:16.469 --> 05:19.284
and I'm sure you're going
to do really well this time.

05:23.007 --> 05:25.642
- Hey, Ethan.
- Oh. Hi, Layla.

05:25.762 --> 05:27.011
What's up with the girlfriend?

05:27.066 --> 05:29.842
I think we may have spent
slightly too much time together

05:29.857 --> 05:31.711
last weekend, too much studying.

05:31.734 --> 05:34.088
So you two don't...

05:34.487 --> 05:36.810
That's what you do on weekends, study?

05:36.930 --> 05:40.031
And we took a survey, I'm trying to have
algebra dropped from the requirements

05:40.032 --> 05:42.182
because no one really uses it in real life.

05:42.213 --> 05:43.652
Hand it over, I'll sign it.

05:43.699 --> 05:45.912
Really? So you agree with me?

05:45.944 --> 05:47.501
Yeah. Who doesn't?

05:47.712 --> 05:50.418
- Kathy.
- Oh? Really?

05:50.538 --> 05:52.842
You mean she actually
wants to study algebra?

05:52.857 --> 05:54.492
Yeah.

05:54.992 --> 05:58.066
Wow. This is a lot of signatures.
Maybe you can actually pull this off.

05:58.186 --> 05:59.560
I mean,

05:59.826 --> 06:02.594
I'm sure you could pull
this off, you're a smart guy.

06:02.714 --> 06:05.950
And you're not bad looking.

06:11.315 --> 06:14.873
Hey, you didn't text me back.

06:14.912 --> 06:17.188
- You texted me?
- I thought I did.

06:17.308 --> 06:20.590
Didn't you participate in the
spelling bee back in Texas?

06:20.637 --> 06:22.631
- Yeah.
- Are you going to compete this year?

06:22.751 --> 06:23.562
Here?

06:24.101 --> 06:27.214
No, not this year, maybe next year.

06:27.245 --> 06:30.304
This year I was new at school and...

06:31.860 --> 06:34.574
that takes up a lot of time and...

06:34.613 --> 06:38.146
And you had a baby, I heard about that.

06:39.375 --> 06:41.127
So, uh...

06:41.401 --> 06:42.676
how are you doing with that?

06:42.796 --> 06:44.920
I don't really want to talk about it.

06:44.944 --> 06:47.040
See, this is why I've never
really approached you before,

06:47.048 --> 06:49.995
I didn't know if I should
bring that up or not and...

06:50.115 --> 06:52.521
I thought I should, you know, because

06:52.641 --> 06:53.984
I don't really care.

06:54.104 --> 06:56.417
But I guess I was wrong. And the thing is,

06:56.448 --> 06:58.051
I'm in the finals for the spelling bee.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.992
And I thought maybe you could tell
me what it's like to go to state.

07:01.180 --> 07:04.453
Study strategies, that sort of thing,
maybe throw some words at me at lunch...

07:04.417 --> 07:05.590
or after school or something.

07:05.598 --> 07:08.218
You made it to state? That's
great! Congratulations!

07:08.233 --> 07:11.291
Yeah, I kind of got involved
because my mom made me, but...

07:11.338 --> 07:12.511
I'm a little competitive.

07:12.550 --> 07:13.613
Yeah, I am too.

07:13.660 --> 07:15.686
So could you help me?

07:16.335 --> 07:18.767
I mean, I know that you have
a boyfriend, but this is...

07:18.806 --> 07:20.316
just a friend thing.

07:20.543 --> 07:22.021
If you're allowed to have friends.

07:22.052 --> 07:23.445
Allowed?

07:23.969 --> 07:25.439
I can have friends.

07:25.486 --> 07:26.549
Good.

07:31.202 --> 07:32.282
Hey.

07:33.204 --> 07:34.604
Is that?

07:34.651 --> 07:36.301
Yeah. Yeah.

07:36.505 --> 07:38.217
Jack and I are engaged.

07:38.256 --> 07:39.569
When did you get engaged?

07:39.570 --> 07:42.909
Last weekend. He surprised
me. He totally surprised me.

07:42.932 --> 07:45.513
- That's so nice. Congratulations!
- Thank you.

07:45.529 --> 07:46.819
So. When's the wedding?

07:46.827 --> 07:49.361
Oh, don't worry, we're going to wait
until after you and Ricky get married,

07:49.400 --> 07:51.152
because you two were engaged first

07:51.191 --> 07:52.513
and we don't want to step on your toes.

07:52.520 --> 07:55.281
Oh no, you shouldn't
plan around Ricky and me,

07:55.297 --> 07:57.017
You should get married
whenever you wanna get married.

07:57.049 --> 07:57.815
Of course.

07:57.831 --> 08:00.810
Well, that would depend on when
you and Ricky want to get married.

08:00.849 --> 08:03.094
And Adrian and Omar. Because
they were ahead of us too.

08:03.102 --> 08:06.011
Isn't it crazy? We're all
engaged, the three of us!

08:06.043 --> 08:08.138
All three of us girls getting married.

08:08.185 --> 08:09.384
It is kind of crazy.

08:09.382 --> 08:11.487
Yeah. Well, there you go.

08:11.509 --> 08:14.199
All of us, young and in love and

08:14.319 --> 08:16.756
getting married and going to college.

08:16.876 --> 08:18.187
It's an exciting time.

08:18.307 --> 08:19.493
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:19.712 --> 08:21.793
So are you going to college out of state?

08:21.816 --> 08:24.303
I don't know if that's
still an option for me now.

08:24.334 --> 08:25.359
Are you?

08:26.149 --> 08:27.494
I don't know.

08:27.614 --> 08:30.677
I guess Adrian will. I mean,
if she follows Omar to New York.

08:30.797 --> 08:34.173
It could be you and Ricky and
Adrian and Omar all in New York.

08:34.423 --> 08:36.299
(Laughs) Yeah.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.184
If I go to New York and if Ricky goes too.

08:39.232 --> 08:40.155
Wouldn't Ricky go too?

08:40.275 --> 08:41.297
I don't know.

08:41.417 --> 08:43.416
But I do know we are getting married.

08:43.535 --> 08:46.615
I mean, we just set the
date last weekend and

08:46.646 --> 08:49.176
I guess it's not a secret so...

08:51.472 --> 08:52.848
Good morning.

08:52.968 --> 08:55.366
I hope it's a good morning
because it was a lousy weekend.

08:55.609 --> 08:57.994
- So what's up?
- Why was it a lousy weekend?

08:58.018 --> 08:59.332
You saw her.

08:59.452 --> 09:00.966
Kathleen's mother showed up here

09:00.997 --> 09:02.655
just as Kathleen and
I were about to run off

09:02.671 --> 09:03.977
and do what you and
Amy were supposed to do.

09:04.097 --> 09:05.322
Why couldn't you take her mother with you,

09:05.353 --> 09:06.300
wouldn't she want her there?

09:06.276 --> 09:07.528
Her mother never really liked me,

09:07.536 --> 09:09.483
then she hated me when
Kathleen and I divorced so...

09:09.507 --> 09:11.759
I don't think we have her
blessing, not that we need it.

09:11.783 --> 09:13.746
She just showed up? She didn't know you two

09:13.769 --> 09:14.684
were going to run off?

09:14.692 --> 09:17.204
Purely coincidental.
Kathleen didn't even know.

09:17.239 --> 09:18.500
I was hoping to talk her
into it and just take off.

09:18.539 --> 09:19.900
(Laughs) You weren't going to tell Amy?

09:19.884 --> 09:21.300
I might have told her, I might not have.

09:21.420 --> 09:22.942
I'm not her son, she's my daughter.

09:22.919 --> 09:25.108
I'm going to do what I want,
what Kathleen and I want.

09:25.093 --> 09:27.565
If Kathleen had wanted to take off and
tell no one, I would have done that,

09:27.588 --> 09:29.301
if she had wanted to ask you and Amy and

09:29.340 --> 09:31.585
Grace and Jack and tom, then
that would have been fine too.

09:31.705 --> 09:33.071
Okay, well.

09:33.532 --> 09:36.190
Amy and I do want you at our wedding.

09:37.294 --> 09:38.318
Go on.

09:38.506 --> 09:40.962
Amy and I are getting married
the day after she graduates.

09:40.985 --> 09:42.174
- Are you now?
- Yeah.

09:42.221 --> 09:43.800
I'm going to want to be
there for verification.

09:43.847 --> 09:46.647
I said we wanted you there.
You and Anne and my parents.

09:46.639 --> 09:47.937
We're just going to go to have

09:47.969 --> 09:50.419
a little ceremony down
at Jack's dad's church

09:50.539 --> 09:52.496
and invite our families and
then go back to our apartment

09:52.519 --> 09:53.575
and have a cake or something.

09:53.599 --> 09:55.006
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

09:55.126 --> 09:56.304
You're really going to get married?

09:56.305 --> 09:57.587
Amy said that she'd marry you for real?

09:57.611 --> 09:59.323
- Yeah.
- Wait.

09:59.443 --> 10:00.645
Why isn't she telling me this?

10:00.692 --> 10:02.147
Cause she couldn't come
over here this morning

10:02.194 --> 10:04.094
to tell you and I wanted to tell you.

10:04.102 --> 10:05.236
She's gonna call Anne.

10:05.283 --> 10:07.301
Amy wanted you to tell me,
she didn't want to tell me?

10:07.316 --> 10:09.225
Either way, it's still good news, right?

10:09.271 --> 10:11.559
There's some reason she doesn't
want to tell me face to face.

10:11.593 --> 10:13.342
- Like what?
- I don't know, but there's a reason.

10:13.338 --> 10:14.527
I guarantee you there's a reason.

10:14.535 --> 10:16.240
She had to go to school.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.882
She'll end up telling her friends,

10:17.874 --> 10:20.353
and we wanted to make sure
you knew before everyone else.

10:20.473 --> 10:23.639
No, there's something else,
something's off about this.

10:23.678 --> 10:24.890
All right, well,

10:25.010 --> 10:26.697
I just thought you should know, so.

10:26.736 --> 10:29.231
I appreciate it. Son.

10:29.567 --> 10:32.289
So you want to stick around, I'll
take you out to breakfast or something?

10:32.409 --> 10:34.291
No, I have to go to school.

10:34.314 --> 10:35.425
Okay, but,

10:35.479 --> 10:37.036
you might as well tell
me what's really going on

10:37.043 --> 10:39.053
'cause I'll find out.

10:40.493 --> 10:42.612
Hey, I was just talking to Grace.

10:42.605 --> 10:45.162
She told me that you and Ricky
set a date for the wedding.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.610
So, I want to make sure I
mark the date on my calendar.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.871
Oh, well, I hate to disappoint you Ben, but

10:51.285 --> 10:53.037
I don't think we're going
to have a big wedding,

10:53.045 --> 10:54.852
so I don't think we're inviting you.

10:54.972 --> 10:56.612
I mean, I didn't come to your wedding.

10:56.638 --> 10:58.199
Well, still. Even if I don't come,

10:58.215 --> 11:00.819
I'll want to send flowers
or a gift or something.

11:00.811 --> 11:02.759
So when's the date?

11:02.879 --> 11:05.222
We're going to get married
the day after we graduate,

11:05.342 --> 11:08.327
just a simple ceremony
at Jack's dad's church,

11:08.546 --> 11:10.767
with our families and
then cake at our apartment.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.628
The day after we graduate?

11:12.667 --> 11:15.772
Yeah. I decided I don't want
to wait any longer than that.

11:15.892 --> 11:20.004
Uh-huh. So I guess that if you're getting
married the day after we graduate then...

11:20.020 --> 11:22.929
you must be planning to go
to summer school in New York.

11:26.339 --> 11:27.825
No, you're not.

11:28.091 --> 11:29.254
No, I am.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.189
I'm going to just hang out here,

11:31.224 --> 11:33.239
not at my grandmother's
house, and coach him.

11:33.261 --> 11:35.108
- Just for a few days a week.
- No.

11:35.121 --> 11:37.143
Ethan, he's just a friend.

11:37.170 --> 11:39.226
No, he's not. He wants
to have sex with you.

11:39.265 --> 11:40.861
How did you jump to that conclusion!

11:40.845 --> 11:43.074
I'm a guy. And I know things.

11:43.194 --> 11:44.779
Like. If that guy is smart enough

11:44.771 --> 11:46.054
to make it to the state spelling bee,

11:46.085 --> 11:47.008
then he doesn't need your help.

11:47.031 --> 11:48.596
He may not need it, but he wants it.

11:48.611 --> 11:49.745
My point exactly.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.176
He wants something from you

11:51.184 --> 11:52.490
and it's not to correct his spelling.

11:52.505 --> 11:53.578
There's a lot involved.

11:53.613 --> 11:55.861
There are these drills that
people do to get prepared

11:55.868 --> 11:57.393
and you need another person for that.

11:57.513 --> 12:00.451
And there are word lists, I have
all these word lists he could use,

12:00.486 --> 12:02.135
and you have to memorize the rules,

12:02.187 --> 12:04.423
you have to know what
to ask about the words.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.306
Everyone uses a study partner.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.107
He wants me to be his study partner.

12:08.122 --> 12:10.359
I cannot believe that after
all you've been through,

12:10.396 --> 12:11.892
you would fall for this.

12:12.012 --> 12:14.280
You're repeating the same
mistake you made with don,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.569
who, as I recall, also went
to the state spelling bee.

12:16.623 --> 12:18.969
Break the pattern! Stay away from spellers!

12:21.949 --> 12:25.789
We have algebra! We
walk together to algebra!

12:29.152 --> 12:30.349
Hi.

12:33.419 --> 12:34.798
Okay. What's up with you?

12:34.837 --> 12:37.919
You usually spend the first minute or two
in here trying to act as if you don't see me.

12:42.752 --> 12:44.396
Amy and I set a date.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.912
Oh? For what?

12:46.032 --> 12:48.300
For our wedding. And it's
not the Fourth of July.

12:48.501 --> 12:49.298
Oh.

12:49.418 --> 12:51.323
When is it now? Labor Day?

12:51.571 --> 12:52.786
Arbor Day?

12:52.817 --> 12:54.858
No, wait, no. I got it.

12:54.978 --> 12:57.462
- Halloween.
- Day after Amy graduates.

12:57.477 --> 12:58.660
With her master's degree?

12:58.699 --> 12:59.762
In just another six weeks.

12:59.786 --> 13:02.095
In six weeks, we will
be officially married.

13:02.085 --> 13:03.517
Aw, well, do I get to come?

13:03.532 --> 13:05.073
Sorry. Just family.

13:05.193 --> 13:05.902
Really?

13:06.254 --> 13:07.881
I'll be inviting the two
of you to our wedding.

13:07.873 --> 13:10.172
Oh, and when is that?

13:10.356 --> 13:13.863
Well, everyone was waiting to set a date
until you and Amy announced your plans.

13:13.879 --> 13:17.140
So now that I know when your
wedding is, I can plan our wedding.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.045
I just hope you don't get cold feet again.

13:19.063 --> 13:20.354
We won't get cold feet again.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.366
Oh, I hope not.

13:21.402 --> 13:23.271
Because if I plan my wedding around yours,

13:23.269 --> 13:24.945
and Grace plans her wedding around yours,

13:24.952 --> 13:26.586
and then you don't have a wedding,

13:26.625 --> 13:28.033
we're all going to get screwed up.

13:28.017 --> 13:29.699
Grace and Jack are getting married?

13:30.576 --> 13:31.772
That's what she told me.

13:31.756 --> 13:34.689
When did that happen? Is
he okay to get married?

13:34.705 --> 13:36.847
Life is good! Praise the lord!

13:37.356 --> 13:40.695
Got engaged last weekend and this
morning I finally got the cast off.

13:40.703 --> 13:41.892
Congratulations.

13:42.012 --> 13:43.010
On both counts.

13:42.971 --> 13:44.256
Thank you very much.

13:46.459 --> 13:49.227
Too bad he didn't have a cast on his
head so we'd know when that'd be healed.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.456
Hey, be nice.

13:50.464 --> 13:51.715
I am nice.

13:51.835 --> 13:54.734
Yeah, Adrian, you are nice.

13:54.922 --> 13:57.909
And I hope you and Omar are
going to be very happy together.

13:57.948 --> 13:59.237
Do you?

13:59.927 --> 14:01.522
Yeah, I do.

14:01.642 --> 14:04.408
I don't think high school was
that great for any of us so...

14:04.444 --> 14:07.446
I hope that college and the rest
of our lives go a little better.

14:07.480 --> 14:09.147
The rest of us, including Ben?

14:09.182 --> 14:10.852
Yeah, why not?

14:11.417 --> 14:13.856
You know he's hoping Amy will
end up living with him in New York

14:13.911 --> 14:14.826
and going to school there.

14:14.946 --> 14:17.322
Well, even if that happens,
she'll be married to me.

14:17.356 --> 14:18.877
Even if that happens?

14:18.997 --> 14:21.326
You would actually let her live with Ben?

14:21.360 --> 14:22.788
He's really not a threat to me now,

14:22.827 --> 14:24.110
not that he ever has been.

14:24.133 --> 14:26.431
Man, I can't tell you how happy I am.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.432
I feel so blessed.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.717
Me too.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.569
(Laughs) Well, me too.

14:30.758 --> 14:32.565
(Laughs)

14:43.834 --> 14:45.350
Hey. I'm not finished.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.066
- Are you cheating?
- No.

14:47.072 --> 14:48.432
I am not cheating.

14:50.794 --> 14:52.179
I'm not cheating.

14:52.922 --> 14:55.427
You've never done this
well on a test before.

14:55.461 --> 14:57.286
Well, I studied all weekend.

14:58.303 --> 15:00.499
With her. Ask her.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.544
(Clears throat)

15:17.472 --> 15:20.199
- Dad? Is everything okay?
- Ricky told me you set a date.

15:20.319 --> 15:22.884
Yeah, but dad, I can't talk right now,

15:22.923 --> 15:24.049
I'm supposed to be in class.

15:24.034 --> 15:27.631
I just answered because I thought
there might be something wrong.

15:27.826 --> 15:29.757
- Is something wrong?
- What?

15:29.758 --> 15:31.368
Why didn't you come by
here and tell me yourself?

15:31.364 --> 15:34.364
Because I didn't have
time to come by there so...

15:34.400 --> 15:36.929
Ricky came by there, he wanted to tell you.

15:37.236 --> 15:38.751
Why aren't you happier?

15:38.774 --> 15:40.683
Because I think it's weird that
Ricky told me and you didn't.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.801
That's not like you.

15:41.825 --> 15:45.852
Well, I guess it is like me
because I let him tell you,

15:45.907 --> 15:47.455
I just wanted to make sure you knew.

15:47.471 --> 15:49.614
<i>- Why the day after graduation?
- Why not?</i>

15:49.734 --> 15:52.413
I wanted to be out of high school
and I'll be out of high school.

15:52.460 --> 15:54.392
Come by the restaurant
either before you pick up John

15:54.431 --> 15:55.299
or after you pick up John,

15:55.283 --> 15:56.707
I want to see you and talk face-to-face.

15:56.699 --> 15:58.356
Dad, you'll see me.

15:58.391 --> 16:02.127
Ricky and I will come by and
have dinner one night this week.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.675
- Tonight.
- Why tonight?

16:03.714 --> 16:06.100
Can't you do what I ask you to
do just for once in your life?

16:06.132 --> 16:08.907
- All right. I'll come by there.
- Good.

16:09.027 --> 16:11.236
George, your mother is here to see you.

16:11.270 --> 16:12.669
You mean Kathleen's mother?

16:12.685 --> 16:14.030
She said she's your mother.

16:14.077 --> 16:15.469
No, it wouldn't be my mother.

16:16.619 --> 16:18.980
- Mommy!
- Georgie!

16:21.146 --> 16:22.867
- Where have you been?
- What do you care?

16:22.922 --> 16:25.116
What do I care? I've always
cared. You're my mother!

16:25.151 --> 16:26.855
You took off, you left
no forwarding address.

16:26.863 --> 16:29.029
You were cheating on your wife!

16:29.255 --> 16:30.695
Which, as it turns out,

16:30.742 --> 16:33.306
was perhaps reasonable
under the circumstances.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.890
I have to hear Anne is
gay from Kathleen's mother?

16:37.010 --> 16:39.364
You know how distasteful that is,

16:39.398 --> 16:42.341
hearing that judgment laid
out for me by that witch?

16:42.356 --> 16:43.501
Kathleen's mother called you?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.993
Victoria? Victoria found
you? How did she find you?

16:46.009 --> 16:48.918
Oh, those churches have more
information than the CIA.

16:49.935 --> 16:50.780
Oh...

16:51.976 --> 16:54.831
- This is yours huh?
- Yeah, this is mine.

16:55.691 --> 16:57.779
You couldn't have called?

17:02.072 --> 17:04.299
Hi. Can I talk to you?

17:04.330 --> 17:06.367
I'm having a problem with my girlfriend.

17:06.488 --> 17:08.034
I don't think so Ethan, but if

17:08.040 --> 17:10.174
you want to talk about any
problems you have with classes,

17:10.185 --> 17:11.901
anything related to school,

17:11.919 --> 17:12.944
I could help you with that.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.429
Okay, yeah. It's about that spelling bee.

17:15.463 --> 17:17.364
That's an extracurricular activity,

17:17.398 --> 17:19.953
I asked Kathy when she came
here if she wanted to participate

17:19.953 --> 17:21.454
and she said that she didn't,

17:21.575 --> 17:23.720
it wasn't the right time for her to

17:23.951 --> 17:25.445
get in front of class.

17:26.259 --> 17:29.069
How do you get in that? That spelling bee?

17:29.707 --> 17:31.033
You have to qualify,

17:31.071 --> 17:33.136
you compete with other
students in your class,

17:33.630 --> 17:35.538
then a student from each
grade competes against

17:35.532 --> 17:37.853
the other students, and then
the winner from this school

17:37.859 --> 17:41.382
goes to the district and then
the district winners go to state,

17:41.389 --> 17:42.677
and then the state winners

17:42.797 --> 17:45.311
compete for regional titles
and then the regional winners

17:45.499 --> 17:47.025
go to the national competition.

17:47.044 --> 17:49.484
How come no one asked me
to compete in my grade here,

17:49.497 --> 17:50.285
in the freshman class?

17:50.310 --> 17:52.424
Notices were posted, you have to sign up.

17:52.544 --> 17:53.970
There aren't invitations.

17:54.001 --> 17:55.721
Did you want to participate?

17:55.759 --> 17:57.686
You could start now and
get ready for next year.

17:57.717 --> 17:58.919
Eh, we'll see.

17:58.981 --> 18:02.053
Meanwhile, maybe you should
stay focused on algebra.

18:02.078 --> 18:04.043
I think I did really
well with that test today.

18:04.068 --> 18:05.726
Your teacher thinks you were cheating.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.384
- Again.
- No. I was not cheating.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.910
Did you let someone look at your paper?

18:09.923 --> 18:11.475
I didn't let someone.

18:11.762 --> 18:14.878
Someone may have looked
at my paper, I don't know.

18:14.903 --> 18:17.775
You and the girl sitting
next to you, Layla?

18:18.493 --> 18:20.394
You missed the same question.

18:20.428 --> 18:22.699
You both missed the same one question.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.625
I only missed one?

18:25.032 --> 18:26.521
Shouldn't we be talking about that?

18:26.552 --> 18:29.136
I only missed one question on that test?

18:29.256 --> 18:31.457
That's an A. I made an
A! In my worst subject.

18:31.463 --> 18:32.433
A subject...

18:32.553 --> 18:35.643
I want dropped from
the required curriculum.

18:37.814 --> 18:40.924
Very impressive. If you had
spent the time you had taken

18:41.149 --> 18:42.675
doing this, studying a little bit more,

18:42.682 --> 18:44.821
you might have made a hundred on that test.

18:44.821 --> 18:46.955
I'll take missing one, thank you.

18:47.143 --> 18:48.469
So you weren't cheating?

18:48.488 --> 18:50.408
Didn't I tell you when I was cheating?

18:51.291 --> 18:53.241
I would tell you if I was cheating.

18:53.249 --> 18:56.278
Letting someone copy
your paper is cheating.

18:56.258 --> 18:57.954
Okay, then I was cheating.

18:58.017 --> 19:01.277
I did not attempt to cover my
paper, so if someone looked at it,

19:01.336 --> 19:04.849
then okay, yeah, I was cheating.

19:05.850 --> 19:08.059
There's nothing I can do to
get into that spelling bee?

19:08.066 --> 19:10.177
Nope. Too late for this year.

19:11.682 --> 19:13.647
Hi. You wanted to see me?

19:13.940 --> 19:16.111
Yeah, she thinks you were cheating.

19:16.161 --> 19:18.783
And it was the teacher
that ratted you out, not me.

19:18.846 --> 19:22.105
Yeah, yeah, we'll talk later.

19:27.611 --> 19:29.496
He's not going to let
you go to summer school.

19:29.531 --> 19:31.398
He's just going to be
happy I'm out of the house.

19:31.433 --> 19:33.804
He's not going to let you go
to summer school just because

19:33.817 --> 19:35.938
Amy Juergens is going to summer school.

19:35.988 --> 19:38.278
I think I know my dad a
little better than you do.

19:38.315 --> 19:41.093
He told me he thinks you're going
to end up in Europe somewhere.

19:41.131 --> 19:43.258
He wishes I'd end up in Europe somewhere.

19:43.302 --> 19:45.724
It would probably be cheaper than
getting an apartment in New York

19:45.743 --> 19:47.195
and going to Hudson university.

19:47.213 --> 19:49.127
He's not going to let you
get an apartment either.

19:49.159 --> 19:50.373
You're going to have to pay for that.

19:50.386 --> 19:51.962
And you don't like working for Ricky,

19:51.981 --> 19:54.521
so how are you going to work enough
hours to pay for that apartment?

19:54.559 --> 19:56.354
I have money, my own money.

19:56.386 --> 20:00.175
Yeah, but it's all locked up, you can't
get to it until you're thirty and even then,

20:00.183 --> 20:02.336
you can only get to so much
a year until you're forty.

20:02.361 --> 20:03.875
- How do you know this?
- Leo told me.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.984
- Why'd he tell you?
- Because I asked.

20:06.104 --> 20:07.701
I wanted to know how that works.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.318
But frankly I think you're
kind of stupid to leave town

20:10.351 --> 20:12.440
and hand over the family business to Ricky.

20:12.474 --> 20:14.575
Why? I don't want in the family business.

20:14.609 --> 20:16.391
What kind of business do you want to be in?

20:16.425 --> 20:18.603
I don't know. Maybe I don't
want to be in business.

20:18.609 --> 20:21.515
Maybe I want to be an artist of some sort.

20:21.549 --> 20:24.809
You should be a meat artist. I
hear there's a lot of money in it.

20:24.841 --> 20:26.680
There's a lot of money in a lot of things,

20:26.686 --> 20:28.544
but you got to love what you're doing

20:28.582 --> 20:31.285
and the only thing I love
right now is Amy Juergens.

20:31.329 --> 20:35.252
She's been sort of the muse
for my entire high school life

20:35.372 --> 20:37.631
and I'm going to follow that
muse as far it'll take me.

20:37.751 --> 20:39.893
Hmm. Right into the crapper.

20:40.013 --> 20:42.915
Speaking of which. Are
you invited to her wedding?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.572
No, but that doesn't mean
there will be a wedding.

20:45.607 --> 20:48.358
- She would bolt a second time?
- Yeah. Even a third.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.836
But that's the point. Married or single,

20:50.899 --> 20:52.387
Amy's going to school in New York,

20:52.507 --> 20:53.889
I'm going to school in New York,

20:53.952 --> 20:55.616
and we're going to end up living together.

20:56.593 --> 20:57.418
Wow.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.272
The day after graduation.

21:00.328 --> 21:03.156
Well, we've got some news too.

21:03.276 --> 21:05.715
On three. One, two...

21:05.740 --> 21:08.393
We got into Berkeley! Both of us!

21:08.456 --> 21:10.070
We're going to Berkeley!

21:10.320 --> 21:11.928
Both of you? Wow.

21:11.953 --> 21:13.305
Gosh, Madison I didn't even know

21:13.317 --> 21:14.700
that you were applying to Berkeley,

21:14.744 --> 21:16.637
I just thought I'd take a shot, and...

21:16.928 --> 21:18.372
We got in!

21:18.406 --> 21:19.680
Congratulations.

21:20.794 --> 21:22.270
Although, I have to admit,

21:22.289 --> 21:26.149
I was secretly hoping that
you'd both apply to Hudson.

21:26.269 --> 21:27.945
Oh, we got into Hudson,

21:28.013 --> 21:29.884
not early acceptance like you,

21:29.903 --> 21:31.680
but we didn't want to be obligated.

21:31.861 --> 21:34.458
In case we both got into Berkeley!

21:37.573 --> 21:39.194
Do you guys mind if I join you?

21:39.314 --> 21:40.351
No. Please.

21:40.633 --> 21:44.268
Hey, look at Grace's hand,
that's an engagement ring.

21:44.388 --> 21:45.788
Oh. From Jack?

21:45.908 --> 21:46.700
Yeah.

21:46.734 --> 21:49.754
Feel like you and Jack, were meant to be.

21:50.572 --> 21:53.489
Besides, we got into Berkeley.

22:00.348 --> 22:02.130
Berkeley, huh?

22:02.250 --> 22:03.118
Yeah.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.051
Pretty impressive. So...

22:05.171 --> 22:07.235
you're just going to stay here, Grace?

22:07.355 --> 22:10.205
Go to school with Jack and Ricky
and Adrian, if she's still here.

22:10.244 --> 22:12.033
Yeah. Maybe.

22:12.233 --> 22:14.486
I mean, Jack still has that scholarship and

22:14.548 --> 22:17.545
I feel like his life has
been disrupted enough so...

22:17.665 --> 22:19.359
I think I'm just gonna go there and

22:19.479 --> 22:22.705
hope that I can get into any
medical school when I finish.

22:23.006 --> 22:26.278
There's not a medical school
connected with that school so...

22:26.716 --> 22:30.614
I guess you heard our parents almost
ran off and got married last weekend.

22:30.645 --> 22:32.291
Oh. No.

22:32.647 --> 22:34.787
No. I didn't hear that.

22:35.269 --> 22:36.870
Yeah, my dad wants me to stop by

22:36.883 --> 22:39.066
between school and nursery so...

22:39.721 --> 22:41.722
I guess that's what he wants to tell me.

22:41.951 --> 22:44.439
I guess we both knew
that was going to happen.

22:44.559 --> 22:46.393
So... what stopped them?

22:46.427 --> 22:48.095
My grandma Victoria showed up.

22:48.215 --> 22:50.272
We used to call her queen Victoria,

22:50.331 --> 22:52.925
then the nicknames got
worse as we got older.

22:53.468 --> 22:55.021
She didn't even show
up for my dad's funeral.

22:55.059 --> 22:57.449
So she showed up for their wedding?

22:57.672 --> 23:00.346
For my dad's and your mom's
wedding? Second wedding?

23:00.408 --> 23:02.042
Coincidence apparently.

23:02.261 --> 23:03.481
And then she ruined it,

23:03.550 --> 23:06.034
pretty much like she's ruined
anything in my mom's life.

23:06.314 --> 23:07.536
Interesting.

23:07.592 --> 23:10.000
I wonder if that will
change any wedding plans.

23:10.044 --> 23:11.965
Your mom's or even yours?

23:11.977 --> 23:13.401
My wedding plans? No.

23:13.454 --> 23:15.394
I don't think my grandma would be an ex...

23:15.938 --> 23:16.977
excuse.

23:17.097 --> 23:19.359
- Do you need an excuse?
- Do you?

23:19.394 --> 23:20.255
No.

23:20.375 --> 23:21.256
You mind?

23:21.376 --> 23:22.777
No, go ahead.

23:22.897 --> 23:24.447
Please. Be our guest.

23:24.835 --> 23:27.106
Ethan is driving me crazy today.

23:27.535 --> 23:29.308
I can't even be friends with another guy

23:29.308 --> 23:30.553
without him getting in the middle of it.

23:30.572 --> 23:31.638
Then break up with him.

23:31.673 --> 23:33.612
You're really too young
to have a boyfriend.

23:33.641 --> 23:35.089
You should just play the field,

23:35.101 --> 23:36.740
there are so many nice guys out there.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.161
Not that you even need a guy.

23:38.192 --> 23:40.069
I'm sorry. Wrong table.

23:40.101 --> 23:42.003
I feel like I'm sitting with my mother.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.248
I've seen the entire country.

23:50.536 --> 23:52.538
I've driven in all 50 states.

23:52.606 --> 23:54.715
Well, you got to do something
when you're avoiding your family.

23:54.759 --> 23:57.349
You told me to get out of
your house and never come back.

23:57.368 --> 23:59.019
- I know, but...
- But what?

23:59.139 --> 24:01.453
I was... embarrassed.

24:01.573 --> 24:03.524
You caught me cheating before
Anne caught me cheating.

24:03.530 --> 24:05.064
And I was just being defensive.

24:05.184 --> 24:07.472
You told me not to leave
Kathleen in the first place,

24:07.497 --> 24:08.567
to try to work it out with her,

24:08.567 --> 24:11.157
- but...
- But she was the one who cheated on you.

24:11.357 --> 24:13.566
She told me. So I accepted it.

24:13.779 --> 24:15.749
I accepted that you would not forgive her

24:15.743 --> 24:17.714
and you needed to go on with your life.

24:17.834 --> 24:19.653
But then to have been hurt like that

24:20.079 --> 24:21.862
and then do it to someone else,

24:21.893 --> 24:23.276
cheat on Anne.

24:23.345 --> 24:24.702
I just couldn't believe it,

24:24.758 --> 24:26.060
which doesn't mean I

24:26.072 --> 24:27.566
wouldn't have come to accept it,

24:27.611 --> 24:29.144
if you had given me time.

24:29.169 --> 24:31.596
I know. I know. But time went by and...

24:31.624 --> 24:33.348
Yeah, times goes by.

24:33.745 --> 24:35.660
And now you're back to Kathleen.

24:35.694 --> 24:36.861
Yeah. But, uh...

24:36.895 --> 24:38.591
I kind of had forgot how her mother is,

24:38.635 --> 24:40.598
and now Victoria wants to
be a part of the picture.

24:40.633 --> 24:42.414
- You know why?
- Yeah. Her husband left her.

24:42.451 --> 24:44.309
Yeah. You know why?

24:44.516 --> 24:46.804
- Isn't it obvious?
- She's got a bad heart.

24:46.924 --> 24:49.301
- She has a heart?
- It's serious, George.

24:49.421 --> 24:52.674
Serious like months, years?

25:05.957 --> 25:07.825
Mom, you don't have to do that.

25:11.407 --> 25:13.278
Please don't do that.

25:13.799 --> 25:16.612
Well, your dishes are
not near the dishwasher

25:16.635 --> 25:18.901
so you have to walk all the
way over there from here.

25:18.901 --> 25:20.505
It's never been a problem.

25:22.875 --> 25:23.975
(Sighs)

25:25.811 --> 25:26.929
Mom, we should talk.

25:26.991 --> 25:30.376
We should but it's too much to talk about.

25:30.432 --> 25:32.631
When you said you need
someone to take care of you,

25:32.751 --> 25:34.587
you really think I should take care of you?

25:34.612 --> 25:37.440
You want me to take care of you?

25:37.923 --> 25:39.416
I didn't even think you liked me.

25:39.460 --> 25:41.055
I like you.

25:41.660 --> 25:44.476
I just don't like some of
the choices you've made.

25:44.516 --> 25:46.661
You don't like any of
the choices I've made.

25:46.724 --> 25:47.675
Oh.

25:50.322 --> 25:53.375
Why do you always choose
men who cheat on you?

25:53.406 --> 25:54.706
I've got news for you, mom.

25:54.740 --> 25:56.860
George never cheated
on me. I cheated on him.

25:56.872 --> 25:57.755
And he left me,

25:57.792 --> 25:59.657
letting people think that
it was the other way around.

25:59.678 --> 26:01.096
- What?
- And wait...

26:01.089 --> 26:01.952
Men?

26:02.303 --> 26:04.643
Marshall was the only other man in my life.

26:05.463 --> 26:07.321
Except for Jeff. But never mind.

26:07.346 --> 26:08.847
Yeah, Marshall.

26:09.166 --> 26:10.669
He cheated on you too.

26:10.789 --> 26:12.276
What do you know about that?

26:14.859 --> 26:17.168
I didn't not go to the funeral

26:17.168 --> 26:19.695
because it was at your church and not mine,

26:19.898 --> 26:22.967
I just didn't want to go
to that scoundrel's funeral,

26:23.001 --> 26:25.707
especially when he died going back to

26:25.751 --> 26:27.415
see his girlfriend.

26:28.229 --> 26:30.193
Did you know he had a girlfriend?

26:30.313 --> 26:31.376
I found out.

26:32.183 --> 26:33.260
How did you find out?

26:33.253 --> 26:34.993
Like missionaries don't gossip?

26:35.113 --> 26:36.212
He had a child.

26:37.516 --> 26:38.716
His name is Jacob.

26:38.751 --> 26:40.792
He found me last year and

26:41.030 --> 26:42.268
he came here

26:42.688 --> 26:45.053
and he met Grace and tom and

26:45.724 --> 26:46.791
then he went home.

26:47.726 --> 26:49.345
You deserve better.

26:52.765 --> 26:55.466
I think that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

26:57.836 --> 26:58.803
Ever.

27:00.672 --> 27:02.874
And why are you saying this to me now?

27:02.908 --> 27:04.609
Because you want to move in here?

27:04.643 --> 27:05.710
I want to...

27:06.812 --> 27:08.479
get to know you.

27:10.373 --> 27:12.600
- And Grace. And Tom.
- Why now?

27:12.618 --> 27:14.014
Why not now?

27:14.070 --> 27:15.109
Because mom,

27:15.141 --> 27:18.219
I don't want my children to
be subjected to your judgment,

27:18.269 --> 27:19.690
the way I was.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.379
I'm sorry.

27:22.230 --> 27:24.989
I just don't know how not to judge people.

27:25.057 --> 27:26.509
It's a bad habit.

27:26.765 --> 27:29.415
I got it from going to church, our church,

27:29.535 --> 27:31.045
the church that I

27:31.165 --> 27:34.073
joined when I got married to your dad.

27:34.573 --> 27:35.950
I didn't realize.

27:36.441 --> 27:37.842
Yeah, well...

27:38.052 --> 27:40.091
I was into it for many years

27:40.135 --> 27:42.725
and then I got this stupid diagnosis.

27:43.615 --> 27:45.665
I wanted to see you

27:46.147 --> 27:48.024
and ask for forgiveness.

27:49.019 --> 27:50.464
And he said no.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.798
And I said I was going to do it anyway and,

27:52.918 --> 27:55.056
basically, I was shunned

27:55.176 --> 27:56.933
for not obeying my husband.

27:56.939 --> 27:58.654
After all these years.

27:58.697 --> 27:59.831
Shunned?

27:59.865 --> 28:01.106
Forty years

28:01.119 --> 28:04.349
and the one time I really wanted something,

28:04.397 --> 28:05.886
he refused me,

28:06.224 --> 28:07.706
and he divorced me,

28:07.739 --> 28:09.384
took another wife,

28:09.504 --> 28:12.086
someone who would obey him.

28:13.856 --> 28:16.584
I used to be a fun person,

28:16.766 --> 28:18.355
I liked to dance,

28:18.617 --> 28:20.601
I liked to have a good time,

28:20.820 --> 28:23.648
I was very popular in high school.

28:24.311 --> 28:26.532
I even planned to go to college,

28:26.652 --> 28:31.137
Europe, become a writer or an artist but...

28:32.698 --> 28:34.599
I met your father and...

28:37.244 --> 28:40.671
Do you really think Grace
should be getting married?

28:40.706 --> 28:41.772
(Sighs)

28:41.892 --> 28:42.840
Yeah.

28:45.070 --> 28:46.410
Hi.

28:46.845 --> 28:48.713
Oh. Hi, Grace.

28:48.747 --> 28:50.182
I just wanted to tell you,

28:50.302 --> 28:52.384
in case you haven't heard,

28:52.851 --> 28:54.305
Jack and I are getting married.

28:54.330 --> 28:56.150
I heard. Great news.

29:00.130 --> 29:02.145
- I'm going to Harvard.
- What!

29:02.145 --> 29:04.022
- Wow.
- That is so unfair.

29:04.041 --> 29:05.248
It's fair. I earned it.

29:05.248 --> 29:07.544
I made the grades, I went
to med camp every summer.

29:07.538 --> 29:09.378
- How is it not fair?
- Oh you're just trying to make me jealous.

29:09.434 --> 29:11.092
Jealous of what? Of my school?

29:11.117 --> 29:12.838
Yes. You didn't even want to go to Harvard.

29:12.831 --> 29:14.639
- Yeah, I did.
- Well, so did I!

29:14.658 --> 29:16.660
- Then you should have applied.
- I did. I didn't get in!

29:16.685 --> 29:20.051
I don't believe this. I'm
so much smarter than you.

29:20.064 --> 29:22.091
No, you're not, because I never
let relationships in high school

29:22.128 --> 29:24.268
interfere with my life plans.

29:27.264 --> 29:28.653
I would like to sleep with you.

29:29.454 --> 29:30.568
- What!
- Yeah.

29:30.589 --> 29:33.639
When we had sex before, it
was really great, wasn't it?

29:33.759 --> 29:35.526
- I guess.
- You guess!

29:35.560 --> 29:37.112
Okay. Yeah.

29:37.125 --> 29:38.226
We have so much in common,

29:38.257 --> 29:39.515
we want the same things out of life,

29:39.565 --> 29:44.057
we're both smart and ambitious
and we're both winners!

29:44.177 --> 29:47.199
You sound a little crazy. Are you okay?

29:47.205 --> 29:49.977
Yeah. Just... I don't
really know what I'm doing.

29:50.002 --> 29:51.147
Help me.

29:55.681 --> 29:59.550
Grace, you've been under a lot of
pressure this year too, haven't you?

29:59.584 --> 30:01.414
It's not easy seeing someone you love

30:01.433 --> 30:02.909
go through what Jack went through.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.329
He's going to ruin my life!

30:04.342 --> 30:07.032
Okay, look, this is not the
place for this discussion.

30:07.026 --> 30:09.910
Maybe I'm not even the
person for this discussion.

30:09.942 --> 30:10.661
No, you are.

30:10.781 --> 30:12.494
You could always listen to
me when I needed to talk.

30:12.497 --> 30:13.264
I need to talk.

30:13.289 --> 30:15.415
I think you should talk to,

30:15.653 --> 30:17.718
maybe a professional.

30:17.736 --> 30:19.676
A professional what?

30:20.408 --> 30:21.759
You're right,

30:21.879 --> 30:24.199
if I go see a psychologist
and the psychologist says

30:24.212 --> 30:26.425
that marrying Jack isn't good
for me, then I can get out of it.

30:26.433 --> 30:28.713
You're trying to get out of a
marriage with a doctor's note?

30:28.747 --> 30:31.782
Grace, marriage is for grown-ups.

30:31.988 --> 30:34.378
That's not exactly a mature
approach to a life decision.

30:34.384 --> 30:35.801
If you don't want to get married to Jack,

30:35.848 --> 30:37.688
that should be the only reason
you need to get out of it.

30:37.723 --> 30:40.459
No. You don't understand. He's
just been through too much.

30:40.497 --> 30:42.660
I can't just say no to him. I can't.

30:42.694 --> 30:44.901
All right, well...

30:45.264 --> 30:46.709
let me know how that turns out.

30:46.734 --> 30:48.380
I really have to go.

30:50.770 --> 30:51.802
Bye, Grace.

30:56.901 --> 30:59.610
Bye. Call me.

31:05.830 --> 31:07.913
I looked for you at lunch.

31:08.426 --> 31:09.702
Do I know you?

31:09.822 --> 31:11.955
I think you know me. I'm Kathy's boyfriend.

31:14.213 --> 31:15.884
Hi, Kathy's boyfriend.

31:16.084 --> 31:16.872
What can I do for you?

31:16.891 --> 31:19.206
You can stop pretending
you need a spelling partner.

31:19.326 --> 31:21.214
If you want some help, I'll help you.

31:21.239 --> 31:22.825
(Laughs)

31:22.945 --> 31:24.424
What's your GPA?

31:24.724 --> 31:26.876
I don't drive, I don't have a car.

31:27.283 --> 31:28.760
Little joke.

31:29.066 --> 31:31.012
Doesn't matter what grades I make,

31:31.132 --> 31:33.633
I'm smarter than you, and
I'm better looking than you,

31:33.753 --> 31:35.754
and Kathy likes me more than you.

31:35.786 --> 31:37.375
We're just friends.

31:37.694 --> 31:40.377
And I do need the help getting
ready for State. You can spell?

31:40.497 --> 31:42.586
- Throw me one.
- Ubiquitous.

31:42.642 --> 31:44.737
Please. (Laughs)

31:44.794 --> 31:47.772
U-b-i-q-u-i-t-o-u-s.

31:47.784 --> 31:49.123
Give me something a
little more challenging.

31:49.186 --> 31:50.312
Coquettishly.

31:50.343 --> 31:53.484
C-o-q-u-e-t-t-i-s-h-l-y.

31:53.484 --> 31:55.117
Opprobrious.

31:56.274 --> 31:58.645
- A-p-
- (Buzzes) Wrong!

32:04.784 --> 32:07.505
Geez, the girl troubles
just won't go away, huh?

32:07.518 --> 32:09.876
- No girl trouble.
- You're in trouble with me.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.172
- You said I was cheating.
- How smart are you?

32:12.292 --> 32:14.912
You copied my paper, every single answer.

32:15.032 --> 32:18.329
If you'd changed even one of
your answers, you'd be home-free.

32:18.449 --> 32:21.075
And I didn't exactly say
you were cheating, I just

32:21.094 --> 32:22.658
said I wasn't covering my paper.

32:22.696 --> 32:24.366
- I hate algebra.
- Well.

32:24.397 --> 32:25.824
I do too, but

32:25.944 --> 32:27.613
apparently, I'm getting better at it,

32:27.733 --> 32:28.902
if you want some help...

32:28.958 --> 32:31.748
Really? You have time
to help me and have a...

32:32.267 --> 32:33.744
What were you doing when I walked up?

32:33.732 --> 32:35.446
Having some sort of spell off?

32:35.452 --> 32:37.774
Believe me, I'd rather punch the guy

32:37.894 --> 32:40.721
but that would be too easy and
I'd get kicked out of school

32:41.009 --> 32:41.885
and then I'd never get,

32:42.005 --> 32:44.025
you know, anywhere with Kathy.

32:44.081 --> 32:46.427
Yeah, I know.

32:46.615 --> 32:47.816
Just do me a favor,

32:48.091 --> 32:49.856
don't text me any offers.

32:49.906 --> 32:52.639
I've had some problems in that area.

32:52.759 --> 32:53.772
So have I.

32:54.078 --> 32:54.923
Really?

32:55.105 --> 32:56.018
Yeah.

32:56.637 --> 32:58.164
I'm sure neither of us

32:58.284 --> 33:00.517
wants to make the same mistake twice.

33:00.567 --> 33:02.224
I'm sure.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.788
Are you?

33:06.072 --> 33:08.443
Never had that happen before.

33:09.500 --> 33:11.765
How did the condom break?

33:12.580 --> 33:14.169
Uh. I don't know.

33:14.289 --> 33:16.471
Well, it's your fault, you were wearing it.

33:16.797 --> 33:18.999
Okay, but uh...

33:19.018 --> 33:20.138
you're on the pill, right?

33:20.338 --> 33:21.195
Yes.

33:21.264 --> 33:23.066
Weren't you on the pill when
you got pregnant with Ben?

33:23.186 --> 33:24.579
I was changing pills,

33:24.617 --> 33:26.594
it was in between one
kind of pill and another

33:26.600 --> 33:28.152
and I don't want to talk about it.

33:28.928 --> 33:29.978
All right.

33:31.142 --> 33:33.588
Well. If you're worried about it, you could

33:33.708 --> 33:35.446
get a morning-after pill, couldn't you?

33:36.235 --> 33:38.643
Yeah. Yeah. I guess.

33:38.687 --> 33:41.621
But I'm not that worried about it.

33:41.921 --> 33:42.860
Right.

33:42.928 --> 33:44.404
What's the worst that can happen?

33:45.531 --> 33:48.008
I get pregnant and then
you get what you want,

33:48.128 --> 33:50.918
I'd have to go with you to New York.

33:54.534 --> 33:56.229
But you are on the pill?

33:56.236 --> 33:57.574
Yeah, yeah.

33:57.694 --> 33:59.107
"Yeah, yeah" what?

33:59.170 --> 34:01.629
All right. Old beef.

34:04.275 --> 34:05.539
New meat.

34:05.821 --> 34:07.654
Boykewich beef.

34:08.686 --> 34:10.339
There is a difference!

34:12.152 --> 34:13.860
Hey, kiddo.

34:14.436 --> 34:16.181
This is Eli, the chef.
Eli, my daughter Amy.

34:16.237 --> 34:17.915
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

34:17.984 --> 34:19.315
- You too.
- You want anything to eat?

34:19.436 --> 34:20.286
Not really.

34:20.330 --> 34:23.308
Kind of lost my appetite when I
talked to Grace this afternoon.

34:24.215 --> 34:26.712
All right, we'll do this later. Thanks.

34:29.458 --> 34:31.655
Before you say anything,
I just want you to know

34:31.980 --> 34:33.400
that Kathleen and I are
going to get married,

34:33.456 --> 34:34.608
we almost got married last weekend.

34:34.627 --> 34:36.690
Dad, you know that I already knew that.

34:36.754 --> 34:38.210
Is it my fault if you
sent your husband down here

34:38.210 --> 34:39.806
to talk to me this morning
instead of coming yourself?

34:39.844 --> 34:42.141
Grace told me that, not Ricky,

34:42.647 --> 34:46.382
and I wanted you to know first about Ricky
and me before we told everyone at school.

34:46.413 --> 34:48.353
You didn't care enough to tell me first.

34:48.396 --> 34:50.110
I mean, you could have
called me or texted me.

34:50.110 --> 34:51.775
I could have. You're right. I'm sorry.

34:51.895 --> 34:53.452
I've got another surprise for you.

34:53.521 --> 34:54.710
- Really?
- Really.

34:54.710 --> 34:56.112
Are you giving me the money for school?

34:56.175 --> 34:57.945
What? No. That's not the surprise.

34:57.976 --> 34:58.852
I told you I'm not doing that.

34:58.972 --> 35:00.654
You're not doing what?

35:01.042 --> 35:03.575
Oh, dear lord. Amy!

35:03.600 --> 35:04.795
You're all grown up.

35:05.120 --> 35:06.609
- Uh...
- I'll give you a hint.

35:06.803 --> 35:08.305
She's my mother.

35:08.367 --> 35:10.726
Oh Amy, you turned out... nice.

35:10.763 --> 35:11.933
Grandma?

35:12.253 --> 35:15.650
What! I thought you were
living in a biosphere in Sweden.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.371
I was. For a while.

35:17.433 --> 35:19.767
Too confining though, had to hit the road.

35:19.942 --> 35:21.169
How have you been?

35:21.344 --> 35:22.683
Uh...

35:22.803 --> 35:23.778
She knows.

35:23.790 --> 35:26.562
Can't wait to meet Ricky
and my great grandson.

35:26.606 --> 35:28.439
I love saying that.

35:28.996 --> 35:31.605
Can you believe I'm a great grandmother?

35:31.905 --> 35:33.919
Hell, I look so young,

35:33.938 --> 35:35.277
a couple of people have

35:35.277 --> 35:36.891
mistaken me for his wife today.

35:36.935 --> 35:38.280
Oh.

35:38.400 --> 35:39.443
Nice.

35:40.626 --> 35:42.303
It's so good to see you, grandma.

35:42.423 --> 35:45.756
I think. Are you sticking around?

35:45.813 --> 35:47.088
I'm sticking around for tonight.

35:47.282 --> 35:49.166
Tonight? What's tonight?

35:53.545 --> 35:56.185
I don't even know why you
wanted me to help you babysit.

35:56.247 --> 35:58.543
Because Ricky and Amy didn't
want me to do this by myself

35:58.550 --> 36:00.351
and no one else was available.

36:00.471 --> 36:02.216
Thanks a lot.

36:02.510 --> 36:05.451
I hope this didn't mess up
any study plans with Brian.

36:06.107 --> 36:08.666
I heard you offered to
help Layla with algebra.

36:08.867 --> 36:12.007
And that would be different from
your helping Brian with spelling how?

36:12.182 --> 36:13.784
You're just flirting with
her to make me jealous.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.805
I'm not flirting with her,
she's flirting with me,

36:15.874 --> 36:17.557
just like Brian's flirting with you.

36:17.789 --> 36:18.559
You know what?

36:18.559 --> 36:20.830
We're too young to just see each other

36:20.848 --> 36:22.325
and have no other friends.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.546
You have girlfriends, hang out with them,

36:24.615 --> 36:26.730
maybe Jody or Francine
need help with spelling.

36:26.748 --> 36:28.206
No, they don't.

36:28.782 --> 36:31.979
Why couldn't you have just been nice
to Brian so we could all be friends?

36:32.022 --> 36:32.980
We need friends,

36:32.968 --> 36:35.089
we don't need to just
hang out with each other.

36:35.132 --> 36:36.146
Why not?

36:36.619 --> 36:38.655
You're afraid you'll
want to have sex with me?

36:38.837 --> 36:40.545
I'm not having sex in high school again.

36:40.607 --> 36:42.596
So if you want to have sex,

36:42.584 --> 36:43.422
then have sex with Layla,

36:43.435 --> 36:45.412
because it's not going to be me.

36:46.575 --> 36:48.896
- Okay. I take that back.
- Too late.

36:49.510 --> 36:51.949
We could maybe make-out a little.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.521
You sure you don't want to
get that morning after pill?

37:00.540 --> 37:01.859
I'm sure.

37:02.798 --> 37:04.875
All right, well,

37:05.294 --> 37:06.952
I hate that I have to leave again.

37:07.189 --> 37:09.129
That's all right, you'll be back.

37:09.486 --> 37:11.400
Yes, I will.

37:15.060 --> 37:16.919
- I guess you're right.
- About what?

37:16.981 --> 37:19.071
The worst that could happen is that,

37:19.065 --> 37:21.611
you get pregnant and we start a family.

37:23.044 --> 37:25.352
If I thought there was a remote chance

37:25.384 --> 37:26.522
that I could get pregnant,

37:26.522 --> 37:29.125
I would talk to my doctor
about emergency contraception

37:29.137 --> 37:30.701
to see what the side effects are

37:30.758 --> 37:33.273
and if I can take it while I'm
taking my birth control pills,

37:33.261 --> 37:36.239
and I can determine that it was
right for me as a last resort

37:36.359 --> 37:37.790
I would use it,

37:38.278 --> 37:41.513
because I am not ready to get
pregnant and start a family.

37:41.525 --> 37:42.289
All right,

37:43.052 --> 37:45.185
all right. I'm just saying,

37:45.379 --> 37:47.776
it's always a possibility
when you're having sex,

37:47.896 --> 37:50.410
and while we take a lot of precautions,

37:50.428 --> 37:53.219
we are having sex, so

37:54.113 --> 37:56.097
- what if that did happen?
- I already told you.

37:56.153 --> 37:58.775
Okay. I don't want a
family right now either.

37:58.895 --> 38:01.014
I don't want to start a family
until you're out of law school.

38:01.052 --> 38:03.842
- Good.
- It's just that with what

38:03.842 --> 38:05.881
happened this afternoon, it's
a good time to talk about it.

38:05.869 --> 38:07.521
To talk about what?

38:08.146 --> 38:09.861
I already had to get married

38:09.867 --> 38:12.325
and I lost the baby

38:12.356 --> 38:14.533
so I am not having to get married again.

38:14.878 --> 38:15.916
I learned my lesson.

38:15.935 --> 38:18.794
Maybe we should get married
before we have sex again.

38:19.770 --> 38:20.571
What?

38:20.815 --> 38:22.561
You want to stop having
sex until we get married?

38:22.586 --> 38:23.600
No.

38:24.094 --> 38:28.005
And don't try to force
me into getting married

38:28.030 --> 38:29.707
and into moving to New York,

38:30.026 --> 38:31.590
I am not going to be pressured.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.374
Wasn't doing that. Just talking.

38:37.227 --> 38:39.022
A year from June.

38:42.676 --> 38:44.934
I want to finish my sophomore year

38:45.435 --> 38:49.089
and then I'll transfer
to somewhere in New York.

38:49.352 --> 38:50.684
I'll take it.

38:54.219 --> 38:55.977
You wanna put that ring back on?

39:05.487 --> 39:06.726
Thanks for hanging out with me.

39:07.120 --> 39:08.803
Almost closing time.

39:09.297 --> 39:11.168
- Yep.
- You okay?

39:11.231 --> 39:12.795
Yeah Leo, I'm good.

39:13.301 --> 39:15.691
Of course we haven't talked
about the one thing I thought

39:15.716 --> 39:17.837
you wanted me to come
down here and talk about.

39:17.957 --> 39:19.940
Couldn't decide if I wanted to bring it up.

39:20.178 --> 39:21.804
She's going to marry Ricky, right?

39:21.810 --> 39:22.486
I think so.

39:22.493 --> 39:23.963
And then she's going to
go off to summer school

39:23.982 --> 39:25.396
in New York with Ben.

39:25.777 --> 39:27.366
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

39:27.410 --> 39:28.743
Then don't say anything,

39:28.863 --> 39:31.039
maybe she hasn't even Ben told me.

39:31.159 --> 39:32.143
Told Ricky.

39:32.153 --> 39:35.187
Summer school starts the
week after high school's over.

39:35.738 --> 39:37.608
And Amy wants to start in summer school.

39:37.671 --> 39:39.369
I knew there was something
she wasn't telling me.

39:39.489 --> 39:41.171
Why on earth would Ricky agree to that?

39:41.205 --> 39:44.127
I don't know. I think he just
desperately wants to marry

39:44.142 --> 39:45.342
the mother of his son.

39:45.376 --> 39:47.091
And I guess that's the only
way she thinks she can go to

39:47.105 --> 39:48.255
New York and not feel guilty.

39:48.280 --> 39:49.268
I got to talk to her.

39:49.244 --> 39:51.384
But not tonight. Tonight's your night.

39:53.284 --> 39:55.986
Okay, daddy, we're ready.

39:58.791 --> 39:59.917
Good luck.

40:00.192 --> 40:02.407
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, Leo.

40:16.022 --> 40:18.141
We are gathered here together tonight

40:18.176 --> 40:20.410
on this happy and joyous occasion

40:20.445 --> 40:22.466
to rejoin these two people

40:23.023 --> 40:24.543
in holy matrimony.

40:26.934 --> 40:28.717
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

40:29.320 --> 40:31.087
We could be next.

40:33.779 --> 40:36.325
Marriage is an awesome institution,

40:36.926 --> 40:39.396
God's way of giving us a lifelong lesson

40:39.430 --> 40:40.899
in forgiveness

40:41.343 --> 40:43.514
and acceptance and love.

40:44.168 --> 40:45.711
It is forgiveness and acceptance

40:45.698 --> 40:47.287
that have brought us here tonight

40:47.632 --> 40:50.748
and love that will keep
this family together.

40:51.275 --> 40:54.411
(Both sobbing)

40:56.347 --> 40:58.381
I felt the same way at my wedding.

40:58.416 --> 41:00.558
Me too. But I did it anyway.

41:00.564 --> 41:03.054
Is everyone okay, should we continue?

41:03.087 --> 41:03.798
Yeah, it's good.

41:03.855 --> 41:05.994
If you two would face one another please?

41:08.359 --> 41:09.316
George,

41:10.136 --> 41:12.958
do you take Kathleen
to be your wedded wife?

41:15.405 --> 41:16.418
I do.

41:18.245 --> 41:19.253
I do.

41:20.717 --> 41:21.805
I do.

41:22.675 --> 41:24.528
- And Kathleen...
- Yes.

41:26.174 --> 41:28.278
Do you take George to
be your wedded husband?

41:28.314 --> 41:29.312
I do.

41:29.347 --> 41:30.347
(Sobbing)

41:48.621 --> 41:49.966
Mom?

41:50.836 --> 41:52.168
Are you up?

41:54.338 --> 41:55.338
Mom?

41:57.241 --> 41:59.209
Do you want some breakfast?

42:02.280 --> 42:03.280
Mom?
