00:25.526 --> 00:30.571
Prepare to surface.

00:30.572 --> 00:31.989
Depth to 58 feet.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.812
Depth, 58 feet, sir.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.245
Sonar, any contacts topside?

00:37.246 --> 00:39.489
No contact, sir.

00:56.348 --> 00:59.843
- Tank center ready to surface, sir.
- Very well.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.482
Vents shut. Ready to surface, sir.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.432
- Depth, 58 feet, sir.
- Very well.

01:10.571 --> 01:13.394
Up periscope.

01:29.006 --> 01:30.631
Point Lonsdale bearing, mark.

01:30.632 --> 01:33.205
013, sir.

01:35.679 --> 01:40.050
- Cape Schanck bearing, mark.
- 125, sir.

01:40.142 --> 01:42.685
- How's the tide, Bob?
- High tide, sir.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.687
Controls rigged for surfacing, sir.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.090
Surface.

01:48.317 --> 01:50.936
Surface, surface, surface.

01:52.112 --> 01:56.198
- Blow main ballast.
- Main ballast blown.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.148
- Depth 45 feet, sir.
- Secure the air.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.330
Open main induction.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.733
Main induction open, sir.

05:17.442 --> 05:22.029
And our scientists disagree as to
when radiation will reach Australia.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.865
The atomic war has ended,
but the Prime Minister reports

05:24.866 --> 05:29.396
no proof of survival of human
life anywhere except here.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.027
Navy department.

06:38.148 --> 06:40.471
Congratulations.

06:45.947 --> 06:48.395
Tea, dear.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.858
I said, "Tea, dear."

07:22.692 --> 07:25.653
Got a bit of a burn yesterday
at the beach after all.

07:25.654 --> 07:29.058
You'd better put some
calamine stuff on it.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.727
You did give Jennifer her bottle?

07:40.669 --> 07:43.128
I laid out your white uniform.
Was that right?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.090
I almost forgot I have to dash.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.383
Peter?

07:47.384 --> 07:50.636
They must be giving you
a ship of your own.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.138
No, darling. They don't
give ships to lieutenants.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.849
Then why would it be
Admiral Bridie himself?

07:55.850 --> 07:58.727
If you were just to replace
someone who's ill or something,

07:58.728 --> 08:01.397
that wouldn't mean seeing
Admiral Bridie, would it?

08:01.398 --> 08:05.598
I don't know. You don't quite
know what to expect these days.

08:07.529 --> 08:11.240
I'll pick up Jenny's milk on
the way home from the station.

08:11.241 --> 08:13.033
Why do you have to pick it up?

08:13.034 --> 08:17.314
They just won't be delivering
it anymore, I understand.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.755
It's a beautiful day, Peter.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.842
If I wheel Jennifer down
to the club after lunch,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.746
could you meet me there for a swim?

08:34.764 --> 08:36.765
Peter?

08:36.765 --> 08:40.169
They just decided that yesterday.

08:53.700 --> 08:58.651
If you're going to be in Melbourne
by 11:00, you'd better hurry.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.128
So long, Charlie.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.477
Hosgood?

10:21.788 --> 10:23.789
- Hosgood!
- Yes, sir?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.375
Have you seen this from
that idiot Attenborough?

10:26.376 --> 10:29.711
- That great correlator of statistics.
- Yes, sir.

10:29.712 --> 10:32.172
It's finally seeped down to him that
most of the oil in the world comes

10:32.173 --> 10:33.549
from the northern hemisphere.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.703
Attenborough says so.
It's now official.

10:38.012 --> 10:40.931
We will carefully conserve the remaining
supplies of petrol in the depot.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.334
Yes, sir.

10:46.312 --> 10:48.355
Hosgood!

10:48.356 --> 10:50.899
Lieutenant Holmes is here, sir.

10:50.900 --> 10:53.302
Yes. Come in, come in.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.766
Sit down. Sit down.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.852
Thanks, sir.

11:02.370 --> 11:05.038
I have an assignment for you.

11:05.039 --> 11:06.498
Do you care for some
of this miserable muck

11:06.499 --> 11:08.333
that passes for coffee these days?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.252
No, thank you, sir.

11:10.253 --> 11:14.381
It's a reasonably important
appointment, as things go these days.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.718
That's getting to be quite a
phrase, isn't it? "These days."

11:17.719 --> 11:21.930
- You find yourself using it?
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid I do.

11:21.931 --> 11:24.766
I'm sorry it can't be
one of our own ships.

11:24.767 --> 11:28.604
It's seagoing though and better
than sitting around on your bottom.

11:28.605 --> 11:31.523
Liaison officer aboard the
American submarine, Sawfish.

11:31.524 --> 11:34.643
She just docked.
Nuclear-powered, of course.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.182
- You know about her?
- Yes, sir. I read the report.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.034
She's at our disposal for cruise.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.078
Reconnaissance or whatever
you care to call it.

11:45.079 --> 11:49.958
You'll sail soon, but just when or where
or for how long, I can't tell you,

11:49.959 --> 11:51.043
not until the government

11:51.044 --> 11:53.533
and a pack of these longhaired
scientists sort themselves out.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.215
She's moored across the dock

11:56.216 --> 11:59.085
from the carrier Melbourne
in Williamstown.

11:59.344 --> 12:02.338
You'll report to the
Captain Towers.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.086
That will be all, Holmes.

12:10.939 --> 12:16.902
Sir, would it be possible to discuss
the duration of this appointment?

12:16.903 --> 12:19.863
No.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.407
But I can give you a
review in four months.

12:22.408 --> 12:27.314
Thanks very much, sir, because I'd
like to be home if possible when...

12:28.790 --> 12:31.443
ls there any official estimate
as to how much longer?

12:32.627 --> 12:35.254
The beaker-heads, the
finger-in-the-wind boys say,

12:35.255 --> 12:36.672
calculating the rate of drift

12:36.673 --> 12:41.704
or what have you, about five
months before it gets here.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.915
That's why I say four for review.

12:51.938 --> 12:54.856
There's transport leaving for
Williamstown, if you care to take that.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.259
Yes, sir.

13:02.407 --> 13:05.826
Hosgood, where is this
coffee coming from?

13:05.827 --> 13:08.996
Supply says it's the best
they can do these days, sir.

13:08.997 --> 13:13.583
- Shall I query them again?
- No, no, no. It doesn't matter.

13:13.584 --> 13:15.877
You have anything
important to do, Hosgood?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.170
No, sir. What is it?

13:17.171 --> 13:21.675
Nothing. I just thought you might
like to take yourself off till Monday,

13:21.676 --> 13:25.012
a fine weekend.

13:25.013 --> 13:26.505
Boyfriend or whatever.

13:29.517 --> 13:32.636
No, I... I guess not.

13:34.689 --> 13:37.592
I'll be here, sir.

13:52.373 --> 13:56.653
All watches of seamen fall
in on the cargo deck.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.288
Rob.

14:07.472 --> 14:11.808
Lieutenant Holmes will be coming aboard
Monday and off and on until we sail.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.727
Better have Benson issue him
what clothing he'll need.

14:13.728 --> 14:15.645
Yes, sir.

14:15.646 --> 14:19.550
- I'll see you Monday, Lieutenant.
- Thanks.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.577
It's funny.

14:30.578 --> 14:32.913
Somehow I get the feeling they're
putting her in mothballs.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.486
Sir?

14:36.250 --> 14:39.961
I'm afraid I'll have to bunk
you with this scientist fellow

14:39.962 --> 14:44.091
who's coming aboard
from the C.S.I.R.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.759
Sorry, I don't know who
he'll be just yet.

14:45.760 --> 14:48.709
That's all right, sir. I'll manage.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.140
Care for a drink before lunch?

14:52.141 --> 14:54.559
Yes, sir, if it's all right.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.270
It's Australian country
in the flattop,

14:57.271 --> 15:01.892
I'll have to stick to Coke.
You have whatever you like.

15:05.238 --> 15:09.449
I'm a bit puzzled about this cruise,
sir. Our destination, I mean.

15:09.450 --> 15:13.620
Admiral Bridie seems
a bit indefinite.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.790
Of course, if there's some
reason I shouldn't know...

15:16.791 --> 15:20.419
No, there's no reason
why you shouldn't know.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.046
But outside of the fact
that it's reconnaissance,

15:23.047 --> 15:25.666
I don't know any more
about it than you do.

15:26.259 --> 15:31.096
Of course, the crew has it all down pat.
We're sailing the end of next week.

15:31.097 --> 15:34.641
We're going north, and we'll
be back in two months.

15:34.642 --> 15:38.922
But I'll let you know as soon as
I hear anything more official.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.482
Do you live in Melbourne?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.568
Just outside, actually,
in Frankston.

15:44.569 --> 15:48.738
That's three-quarters of
an hour by electric train.

15:48.739 --> 15:52.200
You make out all right?
Any serious shortages yet?

15:52.201 --> 15:56.105
Yes, a few, petrol mainly.
But we manage, you know.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.151
Say,

16:00.334 --> 16:04.409
I've been sticking pretty
close here lately.

16:05.840 --> 16:09.009
Think I'm due for some shore food.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.595
You know of a place where
we might get a good steak?

16:11.596 --> 16:13.763
Yes, I suppose so.

16:13.764 --> 16:16.224
The Admiral fixed me up
with a temporary card

16:16.225 --> 16:20.020
for something called the
Pastoral Club. What's that like?

16:20.021 --> 16:23.440
It's a mahogany and polished
brass sort of place.

16:23.441 --> 16:26.193
Some people used to claim it was the
stuffiest club in the Commonwealth.

16:26.194 --> 16:28.445
Of course, I suppose there's
no argument about that now.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.780
Would they have any scotch left?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.282
Yes, if anyone does.

16:32.283 --> 16:35.827
My wife's uncle lives there, mostly
at the bar these days, I understand.

16:35.828 --> 16:38.872
I would think they would
have some scotch, yes.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.741
Sounds good.

16:41.834 --> 16:45.659
Let's give it a try. I'll be
with you in five minutes.

17:01.604 --> 17:05.147
Really, sometimes I think that
child could float a battleship.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.051
That's what I told the Admiral.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.950
Peter, how could you?

17:14.951 --> 17:19.037
Well, I don't know, really. I just
held the towel like this and...

17:19.038 --> 17:21.440
Very funny.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.586
You're starting to get your
figure back, aren't you, Charlie?

17:26.587 --> 17:29.256
You know, after Jennifer and all.

17:29.257 --> 17:32.661
A little here, a little there.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.517
By the way, I invited Captain
Towers for the weekend.

17:40.518 --> 17:43.395
- Peter, you didn't.
- I had to, really.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.938
We had lunch together,

17:44.939 --> 17:48.441
and he started asking questions
about how we live and all.

17:48.442 --> 17:50.902
Mary, I would have looked an awful
clod not to have asked him.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.446
- He'll be all right, I think.
- Was he married, do you know?

17:53.447 --> 17:55.782
- Two kids.
- And they're gone?

17:55.783 --> 17:59.160
Yes, they were in America.

17:59.161 --> 18:02.747
Nappies flying in the
breeze, pablum everywhere,

18:02.748 --> 18:04.124
they're bound to remind him.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.153
We'll just try to get them
out of sight, that's all.

18:07.628 --> 18:11.214
He'll get sodden and weep.
I can't stand that again, Peter.

18:11.215 --> 18:13.383
He doesn't look the type to me.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.511
- Your R.A.F. chum didn't either.
- Now, Mary...

18:16.512 --> 18:20.212
What are we going to do with
him for two whole days?

18:20.641 --> 18:23.143
Well, for one thing, I thought
a party on Saturday night.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.103
Ten or 12 people. We haven't
done that for a while.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.222
Would you like that?

18:28.316 --> 18:33.222
As long as they all understand how I
feel about those morbid discussions.

18:34.280 --> 18:36.990
We would have to get someone
for him, though, wouldn't we?

18:36.991 --> 18:38.491
What about Moira?

18:38.492 --> 18:40.702
Why not? If she's
sober this weekend.

18:40.703 --> 18:43.079
Julian said she'd given it up.

18:43.080 --> 18:47.000
No, darling, you didn't listen. Julian
said she'd given up gin for brandy.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.904
She says she can drink more brandy.

18:51.005 --> 18:55.216
Moira's not a bad notion, in point of fact.
She'd keep him occupied, at least.

18:55.217 --> 18:58.845
But she'd have to stop over, and
we can't just put him on a cot.

18:58.846 --> 19:01.973
Put Moira on a cot on the veranda.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.517
She claims she's not slept in her own
bed the last three months anyway.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.520
That's not entirely fair.
It's all on the surface.

19:07.521 --> 19:10.148
I'll ring her up tonight
and give her the drill.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.276
I wonder what he's like
when he gets a skinful.

19:13.277 --> 19:14.527
- Peter.
- What?

19:14.528 --> 19:18.198
You do understand how I feel,
I mean, about people talking?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.532
Sure.

19:19.533 --> 19:22.494
- And you do love me?
- Of course I do.

19:22.495 --> 19:25.489
Then why don't you ever say so?

19:30.711 --> 19:33.113
Give her what for, mate.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.956
You're looking for me.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.880
Am I?

20:27.601 --> 20:31.604
I'm Moira Davidson. M-O-I-R-A.

20:31.605 --> 20:33.440
It was a very fashionable
name in bad novels

20:33.441 --> 20:34.816
when my mother was young
and impressionable.

20:34.817 --> 20:36.469
I'm a throwback.

20:40.823 --> 20:42.270
Where's Holmes?

20:42.283 --> 20:46.529
He's decking the halls with holly.
He sent me for better or worse.

20:47.329 --> 20:49.151
Better, I'd say.

20:49.623 --> 20:52.151
I'm your date or
whatever you call it.

20:53.169 --> 20:55.492
How'd you recognize me?

20:56.464 --> 20:59.507
I love Americans. They're so naive.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.956
This way, Commander.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.642
A new model.

21:09.643 --> 21:12.979
Only one horsepower, but she does a
good eight miles an hour on the flat.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.939
- Quite a buggy.
- Over 70 years old.

21:14.940 --> 21:16.316
Dad said she was made in America.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.401
- I wouldn't be surprised.
- Give me your toothbrush.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.070
Take Amelia's head while I see
if we can get us out of here.

21:21.071 --> 21:24.475
She's still a wee bit
sticky in reverse.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.067
All right, boy. Here we go.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.083
Is there a place we might stop where
I could get a little breakfast?

21:34.084 --> 21:37.045
- What?
- A little breakfast.

21:37.046 --> 21:38.880
Do you mean that in addition
to everything else,

21:38.881 --> 21:41.508
I have to watch you eat bacon
and eggs and all that muck?

21:41.509 --> 21:42.717
I was on a party last night,

21:42.718 --> 21:45.011
and I got up at 8:00 in
the morning to meet you.

21:45.012 --> 21:47.514
- Well, I...
- Never mind. Hop in.

21:47.515 --> 21:51.590
But you have to buy me a couple
drinks to get me started.

21:52.478 --> 21:55.146
Incidentally, they didn't
tell me what to call you.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.523
What's the protocol?

21:56.524 --> 22:00.360
My name is Towers,
Dwight Lionel Towers.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.695
- Really?
- Really.

22:02.696 --> 22:05.315
Well, hang on, Dwight Lionel.

22:31.767 --> 22:35.854
As a matter of fact, we've only
been in port for three days.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.522
It's called the Sawfish.

22:37.523 --> 22:40.608
My second husband was an American.

22:40.609 --> 22:42.944
We traveled all over the world,

22:42.945 --> 22:45.738
and everywhere we went,
he would say to people,

22:45.739 --> 22:50.034
"I am an American.
I am an American."

22:50.035 --> 22:54.440
They finally shot him in one
of those eastern countries.

22:55.666 --> 22:57.083
I'm sorry.

22:57.084 --> 23:02.380
I was too. He was such a
nice man while he lasted.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.424
Is he yours, Moira?

23:04.425 --> 23:06.293
On loan.

23:23.444 --> 23:26.404
He just drinks and drinks
and nothing happens.

23:26.405 --> 23:30.355
- At least he hasn't burst into tears.
- Keep up the good work.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.453
That's sheer balderdash!

23:33.454 --> 23:36.289
I never heard so much
nonsense in my life.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.792
You mean to tell me this whole
damn war was an accident?

23:39.793 --> 23:44.964
No, it wasn't an accident.
I didn't say that.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.215
It was carefully planned,

23:46.216 --> 23:49.260
down to the tiniest mechanical
and emotional detail.

23:49.261 --> 23:53.211
But it was a mistake,
it was a beaut.

23:54.224 --> 23:57.477
In the end, somehow granted
the time for examination,

23:57.478 --> 24:01.981
we shall find that our so-called
civilization was gloriously destroyed

24:01.982 --> 24:05.886
by a handful of vacuum
tubes and transistors.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.488
Probably faulty.

24:08.489 --> 24:11.240
There you are, Julian.
There you are.

24:11.241 --> 24:14.077
Now we know where the
blame lies. Don't we?

24:14.078 --> 24:17.789
No, you don't. No. No. No.

24:17.790 --> 24:21.292
Maybe we were the blind
mechanics of disaster,

24:21.293 --> 24:23.753
but you don't pin the guilt on
the scientists that easily.

24:23.754 --> 24:26.547
You might as well pin
it on motherhood.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.549
Well, it should be
pinned on somebody.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.219
And you scientists are the likely
ones, as far as I can see.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.845
You built the bomb.

24:32.846 --> 24:36.516
You experimented with it,
tested it and exploded it.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.559
- Now, just a moment, Morgan.
- Thanks to you chaps,

24:38.560 --> 24:39.852
a moment is about all we have.

24:39.853 --> 24:42.855
Every man who ever worked on this
thing told you what would happen.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.273
The scientists signed petition

24:44.274 --> 24:45.817
- after petition.
- Julian, please.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.721
But nobody listened.

24:48.779 --> 24:52.949
There was a choice. It was
build the bombs and use them,

24:52.950 --> 24:55.243
or risk the United States,
the Soviet Union,

24:55.244 --> 25:00.275
and the rest of us would find
some way to go on living.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.293
That's wishful thinking,
if ever I heard it.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.587
I'm not against wishful
thinking, not now.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.631
Look, they pushed us too far.

25:08.632 --> 25:10.883
They didn't think we'd fight,
no matter what they did.

25:10.884 --> 25:14.387
And they were wrong. We fought.
We expunged them!

25:14.388 --> 25:17.086
We didn't do such a
bad job on ourselves.

25:17.099 --> 25:19.892
With the interesting result
that the background level

25:19.893 --> 25:24.230
of radiation in this very room is
nine times what it was a year ago.

25:24.231 --> 25:27.134
- Julian.
- Don't you know that?

25:28.068 --> 25:31.654
Nine times! We're all
doomed, you know.

25:31.655 --> 25:35.074
The whole silly, drunken,
pathetic lot of us.

25:35.075 --> 25:39.120
Doomed by the air we're about to
breathe. We haven't got a chance!

25:39.121 --> 25:42.123
Stop it! I won't have it, Julian!

25:42.124 --> 25:44.042
I won't.

25:44.043 --> 25:45.668
There is hope.

25:45.669 --> 25:47.795
There has to be hope.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.994
There's always hope.

25:50.758 --> 25:53.259
We just can't go on like this.

25:53.260 --> 25:54.957
We can't.

25:55.596 --> 25:57.373
We... We...

26:05.272 --> 26:07.690
I shouldn't drink, you know.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.685
I inevitably say
something brilliant.

26:10.861 --> 26:12.433
Sorry.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.100
I can't help it, Peter.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.769
I'm sorry.

26:44.770 --> 26:47.172
I just can't.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.340
Everybody's gone to bed.

27:32.192 --> 27:35.236
You like that?

27:35.237 --> 27:37.613
Settles the stomach.
I had a lot to drink.

27:37.614 --> 27:40.283
I had a lot to drink.

27:40.284 --> 27:43.202
Julian had a lot to drink.

27:43.203 --> 27:47.290
Julian and I are the town drunks.

27:47.291 --> 27:50.543
What are you trying to forget?

27:50.544 --> 27:54.323
Well, it's a damn silly
question if I ever heard one.

27:55.174 --> 27:58.623
Yeah, you're right.
It's just an expression.

28:00.220 --> 28:06.218
You know, somebody should have given
me a copy of the local ground rules.

28:07.102 --> 28:11.063
I might have opened my big mouth.

28:11.064 --> 28:14.817
Danger struck from
the wrong quarter.

28:14.818 --> 28:18.643
The people of the city
watch the wrong mousehole.

28:20.908 --> 28:22.575
Come again?

28:22.576 --> 28:27.079
But then, who would know you were
so tough and drank straight milk?

28:27.080 --> 28:29.983
Where are you from? Which state?

28:32.085 --> 28:35.455
- I'm from Idaho.
- Idaho?

28:36.298 --> 28:38.090
I know better than that.

28:38.091 --> 28:41.586
There's no navy in Idaho
because it's too hilly.

28:42.346 --> 28:45.795
I was born in Idaho.
I live in Connecticut now.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.677
Near New London, where I'm based.

28:49.811 --> 28:53.215
Where were you during
all the whatchamacallit?

28:54.399 --> 28:55.846
No.

28:56.568 --> 29:00.142
I didn't mean to ask you
that. Peter said not to.

29:00.197 --> 29:02.599
You don't have to answer.

29:02.783 --> 29:06.687
I can't decide if I'm more
objectionable drunk or sober.

29:06.787 --> 29:09.189
It's perfectly all right.

29:10.332 --> 29:12.234
We were at sea

29:13.543 --> 29:16.662
between Kiska and
Midway when it began.

29:17.464 --> 29:20.583
We got orders to go
to the West Pacific,

29:20.968 --> 29:24.372
and when we put our nose
up north of Iwo Jima,

29:24.721 --> 29:28.000
the air was filled
with radioactive dust.

29:29.017 --> 29:31.260
So we ducked.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.717
Later on, took a look at Manila

29:38.151 --> 29:39.652
through the periscope.

29:39.653 --> 29:45.059
It was still too hot to surface, so
we came down the coast of Australia

29:46.159 --> 29:48.232
and ended up here.

29:50.539 --> 29:53.783
There wasn't much of
anyplace else to go.

30:09.558 --> 30:12.837
- You look married.
- I am.

30:13.061 --> 30:15.463
My wife's name is Sharon.

30:17.941 --> 30:20.264
I have a couple of kids.

30:20.319 --> 30:25.316
Richard, eight. Helen, five.

30:33.623 --> 30:36.776
Dick is the real
sailor of the family.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.455
He is going to go to Annapolis.

30:43.050 --> 30:45.293
That's to be expected.

30:45.886 --> 30:48.630
He'll probably change his mind.

30:51.516 --> 30:53.793
Why is it taking so long?

30:55.729 --> 30:58.302
Can you explain it to me?

30:59.733 --> 31:02.306
Nobody can explain it to me.

31:02.486 --> 31:07.312
And don't tell me about
those damn winds again.

31:07.407 --> 31:10.201
How the northern hemisphere
and the southern hemisphere

31:10.202 --> 31:12.495
get all mixed up and overlap.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.623
I don't want to hear
about that anymore.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.992
All I want to know is...

31:18.001 --> 31:20.878
if everybody was so smart,

31:20.879 --> 31:23.998
why didn't they know
what would happen?

31:24.424 --> 31:26.076
They did.

31:28.261 --> 31:31.835
Well, I... I can't take it.

31:33.183 --> 31:34.630
I...

31:35.268 --> 31:37.386
Yes, I can take it.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.774
But it's unfair.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.974
It's unfair because
I didn't do anything.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.976
And nobody I know did anything.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.976
Maybe I'm stupid.

31:51.576 --> 31:54.274
I had to take algebra twice.

31:56.790 --> 32:00.319
The only thing I could
understand was geography.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.704
I like geography.

32:07.759 --> 32:10.708
You know what I
always wanted to do?

32:12.139 --> 32:15.292
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.726
Have you ever been to
the Rue de Rivoli?

32:17.727 --> 32:18.811
Yes.

32:18.812 --> 32:21.931
I wanted to walk down
the Rue de Rivoli,

32:23.150 --> 32:25.644
and I wanted to buy gloves.

32:26.778 --> 32:30.352
I know the French
word for gloves...

32:54.347 --> 32:57.375
No, you've got it all backwards.

32:57.767 --> 32:58.851
What's that?

32:58.852 --> 33:03.507
I was supposed to comfort you,
and you're comforting me.

33:03.773 --> 33:05.595
I'm crying.

33:05.775 --> 33:08.974
Everybody was so afraid
that you might cry.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.940
- They were?
- Isn't that funny?

33:15.243 --> 33:16.735
No.

33:17.496 --> 33:19.443
Sometimes I do.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.784
You better go to bed.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.742
But you're in my bedroom.

33:35.222 --> 33:37.124
I'll clear out.

33:40.894 --> 33:42.466
Dwight.

33:48.401 --> 33:50.803
Even if you don't like me,

33:51.404 --> 33:55.274
would you please hold onto
me just for a moment longer?

34:15.387 --> 34:17.585
This fellow Julian...

34:18.306 --> 34:22.268
I take it that he's English and here
on some kind of scientific job.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.670
What does he do, exactly?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.211
I think Professor Jorgensen
should outline his plan

35:31.212 --> 35:33.464
before we make a decision.

35:33.465 --> 35:38.969
Simply stated, our view,
our strong opinion, is this,

35:38.970 --> 35:41.472
that during the last winter
in the northern hemisphere,

35:41.473 --> 35:44.850
rain and snow may have
washed the air, so to speak,

35:44.851 --> 35:49.757
causing the radioactive elements to fall to
the ground more quickly than anticipated.

35:50.190 --> 35:53.359
But the transfer of
radioactivity to us

35:53.360 --> 35:55.235
would be progressively decreased,

35:55.236 --> 35:58.030
and human life could go on here
or, at least in Antarctica...

35:58.031 --> 36:00.366
That's clear enough,
Professor Jorgensen.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.950
It's a hope.

36:01.951 --> 36:05.480
We agree and the government agrees that
it's worth trying to find out, anyhow.

36:05.664 --> 36:08.832
How far north could
a vessel proceed?

36:08.833 --> 36:12.961
Our recommendation is that
the submarine should go

36:12.962 --> 36:15.964
as far north in the
Pacific as possible,

36:15.965 --> 36:20.290
to Point Barrow, and make the
necessary radioactivity readings.

36:21.221 --> 36:22.971
The Prime Minister's
instruction, incidentally,

36:22.972 --> 36:26.475
is the Sawfish be exposed to
as few dangers as possible.

36:26.476 --> 36:30.471
Commander, how about
ice that far north?

36:30.897 --> 36:33.774
She's no icebreaker.
We can feel our way.

36:33.775 --> 36:37.528
I make it over 13,000
miles round trip.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.931
Enough power in your reactor
for that, Commander?

36:40.031 --> 36:43.409
I understand there's a considerable
stockpile of uranium here.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.536
Enough for 10 trips like this.

36:45.537 --> 36:47.746
Wish we had something
we could use it in.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.525
You might try using it in my car.

37:10.687 --> 37:13.556
Get a load of the Charlie Wheeler.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.907
- May I be of assistance?
- Yes, I'm looking for Captain Towers.

37:23.908 --> 37:26.076
I'll try to locate him for you.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.538
Paulson, show the lady to Captain
Towers' cabin on the Melbourne.

37:29.539 --> 37:31.540
- Thank you very much.
- It's a pleasure.

37:31.541 --> 37:33.864
Right this way, please.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.835
Relax.

37:58.318 --> 37:59.935
Captain.

38:02.155 --> 38:05.604
There's somebody to see you.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.062
I asked her to wait
in your stateroom.

38:25.845 --> 38:26.929
Hello.

38:26.930 --> 38:29.723
A very nice man asked
me to wait here.

38:29.724 --> 38:32.923
I don't think he knew
what to do with me.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.964
That's debatable.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.884
Did you ask me to visit
your submarine one day?

38:40.693 --> 38:43.562
- No.
- I couldn't remember.

38:44.739 --> 38:47.688
In the meantime,
I've been snooping.

38:51.538 --> 38:54.942
Regular fish, these kids.

38:55.250 --> 38:59.371
I'll have to get them a boat of
their own one of these days.

39:03.716 --> 39:06.039
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

39:06.219 --> 39:08.542
Here, have a cigarette.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.257
Thank you.

39:15.728 --> 39:17.801
I'm glad you came.

39:18.773 --> 39:20.065
I just bet you are.

39:20.066 --> 39:22.309
No, I am. Really.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.487
And I'll just bet that my crew
didn't mind too much either.

39:25.488 --> 39:29.813
Yes, I have a sneaking suspicion
they didn't mind at all.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.728
Come in.

39:32.078 --> 39:35.448
- I see they found you.
- Mr. Chrysler.

39:36.291 --> 39:38.792
See if you can find Ms. Davidson
something she can wear

39:38.793 --> 39:40.419
to go down in the
Sawfish, will you?

39:40.420 --> 39:42.163
Yes, sir.

39:46.843 --> 39:49.337
I take it you put me to bed.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.171
Yes.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.181
I arrived at that by deduction.

39:53.182 --> 39:56.506
I asked Peter and Mary,
and they didn't.

39:57.770 --> 40:00.314
I'm afraid I was a bit of a mess.

40:00.315 --> 40:03.514
You drank too much brandy.
You passed out.

40:03.651 --> 40:08.227
Yes, I've been drinking quite a bit
recently. That's no big secret.

40:08.281 --> 40:10.657
But, you know, I...

40:10.658 --> 40:14.278
I've never had it happen
quite like that before.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.612
My obvious job was to seduce you.

40:22.211 --> 40:25.034
So I suppose my pride is hurt.

40:25.965 --> 40:28.413
I ought to feel ashamed.

40:31.721 --> 40:34.249
Why did you bother about me?

40:46.235 --> 40:48.946
There's a regulation
in here somewhere.

40:48.947 --> 40:51.395
It's under "Shore duty."

40:51.741 --> 40:54.564
- I'll read it to you.
- No, tell me.

40:58.790 --> 41:00.999
It says when a young lady
has had so much to drink,

41:01.000 --> 41:02.709
that she doesn't know
what she's doing,

41:02.710 --> 41:04.783
you put her to bed

41:05.546 --> 41:07.914
and go back to the ship.

41:09.217 --> 41:12.461
- That's what it says?
- That's what it says.

41:14.472 --> 41:15.919
Yes?

41:25.817 --> 41:30.153
This requires quite a comprehensive
change. Are you sure about this?

41:30.154 --> 41:33.782
You can't go down in a submarine
in that ballet costume.

41:33.783 --> 41:36.277
I'll give you five minutes.

41:44.627 --> 41:47.780
Unpack that one next,
please. That one.

41:48.047 --> 41:51.675
- Everything under control, Mr. Osborn?
- I guess so.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.720
Blasted idiots sent me
two wrong components.

41:54.721 --> 41:57.431
I'll have to get them
replaced this afternoon.

41:57.432 --> 41:58.849
As long as they're
right when we sail.

41:58.850 --> 42:01.548
What on earth is he doing here?

42:01.728 --> 42:06.314
Mr. Osborn's been assigned by the C.S.I.R.
to look after our health on the trip.

42:06.315 --> 42:07.399
Health?

42:07.400 --> 42:09.401
It's your submarine.

42:09.402 --> 42:12.070
Captain, may I see
you a minute, sir?

42:12.071 --> 42:14.018
Half a second.

42:16.075 --> 42:17.409
Very becoming outfit.

42:17.410 --> 42:18.910
You know, Julian,

42:18.911 --> 42:22.164
they don't allow drinking
on American submarines.

42:22.165 --> 42:24.332
I can't imagine what else you'd do.

42:24.333 --> 42:25.917
Thanks very much.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.419
What are you going to do?

42:27.420 --> 42:30.915
Keep an eye on the weather.
Check on radiation.

42:30.923 --> 42:34.497
I guess I'm sort of a
scientific cruise director.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.792
Then it can be dangerous?

42:38.473 --> 42:40.474
I wouldn't know, really.

42:40.475 --> 42:43.477
A relative question
at best, isn't it?

42:43.478 --> 42:46.063
It seems that everybody
I know is going.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.512
I feel left out.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.236
I can sing and dance.

42:53.237 --> 42:56.281
You'll have to excuse me.
The Admiral is up top.

42:56.282 --> 42:58.355
Don't you go away.

43:11.297 --> 43:15.383
It's the damnedest thing. Started
the day before yesterday.

43:15.384 --> 43:18.207
Came on again 10 minutes ago, sir.

43:18.596 --> 43:22.099
Starts and stops. We've
monitored 60 hours so far.

43:22.100 --> 43:25.727
It's weird. You're sure
it's from San Diego?

43:25.728 --> 43:27.938
Within a 100-mile radius, sir.

43:27.939 --> 43:32.344
It's as close as we're able to
pinpoint it without triangulation.

43:33.069 --> 43:36.655
Could it be a kid, somebody
who doesn't know Morse?

43:36.656 --> 43:39.900
We've made two words up to
now, sir. "Water" and "connect."

43:40.034 --> 43:42.661
You know the old story about
an infinite number of monkeys

43:42.662 --> 43:44.663
and an infinite number
of typewriters.

43:44.664 --> 43:48.113
One of them has to end
up by writing King Lear.

43:48.584 --> 43:52.170
I may be cracking up under the
strain, like everybody else,

43:52.171 --> 43:53.672
but this interests me.

43:53.673 --> 43:55.507
It's more than Jorgensen's
theory. It's a fact.

43:55.508 --> 43:58.051
It's impossible, but it's a fact.

43:58.052 --> 44:01.638
A radio signal is coming from around
San Diego, and they shouldn't be.

44:01.639 --> 44:04.349
There shouldn't even be any
power for transmission.

44:04.350 --> 44:07.003
- Hydroelectric?
- Yes, possibly.

44:07.854 --> 44:10.897
There has to be an explanation for
it, and I'd like to know what it is.

44:10.898 --> 44:14.222
Not that I'll live any
longer for knowing.

44:15.528 --> 44:18.431
How would you like
to track it down?

44:19.657 --> 44:21.658
- I'd like it, sir.
- Very well, then.

44:21.659 --> 44:24.161
I've been onto our
electronic wizards.

44:24.162 --> 44:26.079
They tell us you have
radio direction equipment

44:26.080 --> 44:27.664
that can be used from
periscope depth.

44:27.665 --> 44:30.625
- Is that correct?
- Yes. It hasn't been used much.

44:30.626 --> 44:31.793
But I have to run some tests.

44:31.794 --> 44:34.212
I'd like it to be in the pink.

44:34.213 --> 44:36.715
Perhaps you can amuse yourself
around here a little longer,

44:36.716 --> 44:39.244
until you're ready to leave.

46:00.591 --> 46:03.039
What did you do that for?
We could have won.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.668
They've had it.

46:07.723 --> 46:09.849
Are they all right?

46:09.850 --> 46:13.345
They're all right, but
they're out of the race.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.032
It's like looking
at a French movie.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.746
Dr. Fletcher?

46:48.097 --> 46:51.091
What about these pills they've got,

46:51.350 --> 46:53.143
whatever they are?

46:53.144 --> 46:55.687
They'll be available from the
chemists' shops on the free list,

46:55.688 --> 46:57.840
when the time comes.

46:59.358 --> 47:02.652
I understand that they
have got them already

47:02.653 --> 47:04.779
at Port Moresby and Darwin.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.602
Apparently.

47:09.535 --> 47:12.154
What's the effect?

47:13.581 --> 47:17.451
Lethargy, then some euphoria, coma,

47:17.793 --> 47:19.661
then nothing.

47:19.879 --> 47:22.122
In fairly rapid order.

47:24.342 --> 47:25.914
You...

47:27.345 --> 47:30.669
You don't suppose you
could get me a couple?

47:30.848 --> 47:35.469
And... Whatever it is for children?

47:38.064 --> 47:39.966
Not a chance.

47:40.775 --> 47:42.973
Until the time comes.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.731
Sorry, Peter.

47:49.992 --> 47:53.692
I'm beginning to twitch when
I hear the word "time."

47:53.746 --> 47:57.415
If for some reason I'm not talking
about now, I'm just talking...

47:57.416 --> 48:00.710
if there's one thing
you could do...

48:00.711 --> 48:02.837
No. No, I know what I mean.

48:02.838 --> 48:04.422
When the dentist is
drilling your tooth,

48:04.423 --> 48:05.840
what do you think about?

48:05.841 --> 48:09.165
The nicest thing? Sex? Or what?

48:10.763 --> 48:12.347
Fishing.

48:12.348 --> 48:15.100
Trout fishing in a
clean mountain stream.

48:15.101 --> 48:16.351
You would.

48:16.352 --> 48:18.520
Why not go then when you come back?

48:18.521 --> 48:21.689
The season doesn't open
until September. I've asked.

48:21.690 --> 48:23.525
You think I can't fix that?

48:23.526 --> 48:25.110
You think I don't know
important people,

48:25.111 --> 48:27.445
that I spend all my time with
this moldy suburban set?

48:27.446 --> 48:30.824
You can't mean me. She never bottled
like that before. What happened?

48:30.825 --> 48:33.076
She bottled us.
I was trying to win.

48:33.077 --> 48:35.912
Taking the race too seriously, not
paying enough attention to her.

48:35.913 --> 48:38.039
Truth is, he made a pass at me.

48:38.040 --> 48:39.541
I had to go overboard
in self-defense.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.535
Well, if that...

48:45.423 --> 48:49.623
I do so much like to see the
young folks enjoying themselves.

48:50.845 --> 48:51.928
What?

48:51.929 --> 48:53.847
You never wrestle with me anymore.

48:53.848 --> 48:55.140
What does that mean?

48:55.141 --> 48:59.102
I mean exactly what I say. You
never wrestle with me anymore.

48:59.103 --> 49:01.312
- All right.
- Peter, really.

49:01.313 --> 49:05.684
- Well, I thought you said I never wrestle.
- Never mind... For now.

49:08.654 --> 49:12.649
- Now, tell them the truth.
- But I told them the truth.

49:13.117 --> 49:16.020
Sharon is the most
terrible liar that...

49:52.823 --> 49:55.700
I think it's absolutely
preposterous.

49:55.701 --> 49:58.786
How much of this Gould Campbell
have we got left, Stevens?

49:58.787 --> 50:01.122
Better than 400 bottles, sir.

50:01.123 --> 50:04.751
And in its prime.
Shocking. Shocking!

50:04.752 --> 50:07.378
Four hundred bottles of
vintage port in the cellars

50:07.379 --> 50:09.756
and barely five months to go.

50:09.757 --> 50:14.253
Five months, mark you! If what
these scientist chaps say is right.

50:14.720 --> 50:17.722
I think it needs another
year, actually.

50:17.723 --> 50:21.798
I blame the wine committee very
much. Very much, indeed.

50:21.810 --> 50:23.937
Should have had more foresight.

50:23.938 --> 50:28.316
How can the members be expected to
get through 400 bottles of port

50:28.317 --> 50:30.318
in five months' time?

50:30.319 --> 50:32.195
Bad planning, I say.

50:32.196 --> 50:33.321
Ridiculous.

50:33.322 --> 50:35.406
I'll take another bottle
home with me today, Stevens.

50:35.407 --> 50:37.104
Yes, sir.

50:43.332 --> 50:44.958
Sir Douglas Froude is expecting me.

50:44.959 --> 50:48.283
- I believe he's in the bar, sir.
- Thank you.

50:57.888 --> 51:00.711
Yes, I've heard about those pills.

51:00.808 --> 51:04.811
This cruise is developing into
something bigger than I thought.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.681
I may not be here when it happens.

51:07.815 --> 51:11.693
I understand, but if Dr. Fletcher
can't get them for you,

51:11.694 --> 51:13.971
I'm not certain I can.

51:14.321 --> 51:17.645
I've tried everything else.
You're my last hope.

51:17.825 --> 51:21.354
You're convinced you want
Mary to have them now?

51:24.331 --> 51:28.281
I've thought about it a great deal.
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

51:28.877 --> 51:31.700
I'm not certain you're right.

51:33.382 --> 51:35.705
But considering Mary...

51:37.886 --> 51:42.666
I don't know how much weight I carry
with the government in my old age.

51:42.891 --> 51:47.137
There's a lot of bureaucracy
still, you know? Even in death.

51:49.898 --> 51:53.472
But take this around anyway
and see what happens.

52:00.200 --> 52:01.618
Thank you.

52:01.619 --> 52:05.114
The wine committee is
mad, absolutely mad.

52:05.372 --> 52:08.400
Four hundred bottles
of vintage port.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.495
Too late. Too late.

52:11.879 --> 52:14.998
Sorry, Dykers. Good show. Carry on.

52:20.846 --> 52:24.390
As a matter of fact, the whole
thing is due to the wine committee

52:24.391 --> 52:27.894
having failed to conserve
their supplies properly.

52:27.895 --> 52:30.297
If they'd only regulated their...

52:41.200 --> 52:42.852
How nice.

52:43.952 --> 52:48.528
Have you noticed Moira isn't drinking
nearly so much? I wonder why.

52:48.540 --> 52:50.863
No, I hadn't noticed.

52:51.460 --> 52:53.032
Peter?

52:53.212 --> 52:56.130
Could we afford an electric
mower for the lawn?

52:56.131 --> 52:59.967
A very little one I could start
myself while you're away?

52:59.968 --> 53:01.886
Doris Haymes has one.

53:01.887 --> 53:03.584
She does.

53:04.640 --> 53:08.965
She's cut the cord three times
and nearly electrocuted herself.

53:09.436 --> 53:12.730
Besides, darling,
I doubt there's any left.

53:12.731 --> 53:14.553
What's that?

53:25.452 --> 53:27.775
Sit down, sit down.

53:31.959 --> 53:35.784
This is something I want you
to know about before I go.

53:35.921 --> 53:38.415
You're going to be serious?

53:39.466 --> 53:41.426
I wish you wouldn't.

53:41.427 --> 53:44.000
I wish I didn't have to be.

53:46.140 --> 53:50.511
Now, darling, this is a big
cruise we're going on.

53:50.519 --> 53:53.020
There will be mines and
ice to contend with.

53:53.021 --> 53:57.525
Peter, I knew when I married you that
you were going to be a naval officer.

53:57.526 --> 54:00.896
My father died at sea.
You know that.

54:01.613 --> 54:04.766
We just don't have to
discuss it, do we?

54:04.950 --> 54:06.242
We have to discuss this, Mary,

54:06.243 --> 54:07.952
because there isn't any
tradition for this.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.078
Peter...

54:09.079 --> 54:12.403
And you're going to listen
whether you like it or not.

54:16.003 --> 54:18.826
Now, this is a special kind of

54:19.798 --> 54:21.700
sleeping pill.

54:22.509 --> 54:25.511
I had a devil of a
time getting them,

54:25.512 --> 54:27.305
but I wanted you to
have them on hand.

54:27.306 --> 54:30.459
And make sure you
knew how to use them.

54:34.897 --> 54:38.847
What happens with the
radiation is that you get ill.

54:39.026 --> 54:42.851
You start feeling sick,
and then you are sick.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.932
And you go on being sick.

54:47.284 --> 54:49.857
You can't keep anything down.

54:50.078 --> 54:54.108
You may feel better for a while,
but it always comes back.

54:56.084 --> 54:58.486
You get weaker.

55:01.089 --> 55:03.162
And this cures it?

55:05.177 --> 55:08.012
Darling, you know nothing cures it.

55:08.013 --> 55:10.040
This ends it.

55:15.020 --> 55:16.922
But, Peter...

55:17.022 --> 55:19.095
However ill I was,

55:19.358 --> 55:21.510
I couldn't do that.

55:21.568 --> 55:24.062
Who'd look after Jennifer?

55:27.741 --> 55:29.518
Jenny will get it, too.

55:36.083 --> 55:39.085
You're not trying to tell me
you want me to kill Jennifer?

55:39.086 --> 55:41.587
Mary, don't be an idiot!
Supposing you get it first,

55:41.588 --> 55:44.090
what are you going to do? Struggle
by yourself until you drop?

55:44.091 --> 55:47.593
Jenny might live for days and be helpless
in her crib with you dead on the floor!

55:47.594 --> 55:50.543
Don't you see that?
Don't you see it?

55:55.644 --> 55:58.388
Darling, I'm sorry.

55:59.147 --> 56:03.017
I can't believe it
myself half the time.

56:03.735 --> 56:07.309
Let's not discuss it
anymore right now, Peter.

56:09.074 --> 56:14.078
Anyway, Mrs. Hildreth's husband was
talking to someone the other day,

56:14.079 --> 56:18.200
who said it isn't
coming here after all.

56:18.292 --> 56:22.697
- He says it's slowing...
- For God's sake, Hildreth's a damn fool!

57:01.293 --> 57:03.002
Let's go.

57:03.003 --> 57:05.504
Would you like another drink?

57:05.505 --> 57:08.454
No, let's go for a walk.

57:08.467 --> 57:10.039
All right.

57:15.182 --> 57:18.184
You know, I think I've
discovered why you fascinate me.

57:18.185 --> 57:20.258
Shall I tell you?

57:22.940 --> 57:25.684
Because you take me for granted.

57:28.070 --> 57:32.573
I know women aren't supposed to like
that sort of thing, but somehow I do.

57:32.574 --> 57:34.575
I've been treated
in every other way.

57:34.576 --> 57:36.569
Like a child...

57:37.079 --> 57:39.481
And sometimes like...

57:41.208 --> 57:44.407
Well, like things I've
probably deserved.

57:45.087 --> 57:49.833
But I've never been pushed
around in such a nice way

57:49.841 --> 57:52.915
and treated something like a wife.

57:55.847 --> 58:00.142
I suppose what I mean is,
like an American wife.

58:00.143 --> 58:04.173
- Moira, this isn't going to do us any...
- No, hear me out.

58:07.818 --> 58:12.974
I was hurt at first when I realized
you were mixing me up with Sharon.

58:14.825 --> 58:17.227
And then I realized that,

58:17.244 --> 58:21.444
that it was one of the nicest
things that could happen to me.

58:22.708 --> 58:27.579
I wouldn't really mind if you
could forget entirely who I am.

58:30.716 --> 58:33.744
I don't like myself
very much anyway.

58:39.057 --> 58:41.459
Wouldn't you like to try?

58:56.033 --> 58:57.776
No.

59:07.044 --> 59:09.663
It seemed like a good idea.

59:11.256 --> 59:13.408
I suppose it wasn't.

59:14.551 --> 59:17.219
There's a train leaving at 10:50.

59:17.220 --> 59:19.418
I think I'll take it.

59:42.746 --> 59:46.525
You see, in the navy,
during the war,

59:47.459 --> 59:50.211
I got used to the idea that
something might happen to me,

59:50.212 --> 59:52.364
I might not make it.

59:53.715 --> 59:56.243
I also got used to the idea

59:58.136 --> 01:00:02.586
of my wife and
children safe at home.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.050
They'd be all right,
no matter what.

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:11.842
What I didn't reckon
with was that in this...

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.985
This kind of a monstrous war,

01:00:14.986 --> 01:00:18.310
something might happen to them

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:21.192
and not to me.

01:00:25.831 --> 01:00:27.699
Well, it did.

01:00:30.127 --> 01:00:32.029
And I can't...

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:37.424
I can't cope with it.

01:00:37.425 --> 01:00:39.168
My kids...

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:45.376
All the planning since
the day they were born.

01:00:45.851 --> 01:00:47.503
Sharon...

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:50.088
Sharon and I, we...

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.594
Well...

01:00:55.402 --> 01:00:58.601
See, we were the sort
of people who...

01:01:01.283 --> 01:01:04.687
We would have been happy
to grow old together.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:11.114
I can't accept it. I can't...

01:01:16.715 --> 01:01:20.119
Does that make any sense?
Do you understand?

01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:23.497
Yes.

01:01:25.432 --> 01:01:27.425
It makes sense.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:31.466
I understand.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:35.929
Good night.

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.776
I am sorry to see this.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:32.748
And you were doing
so much better, too.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:37.029
I would like to come
in, whatever this is.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:40.081
An opium den, more than likely.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.343
How on earth did you find me?

01:02:58.942 --> 01:03:00.484
What is it?

01:03:00.485 --> 01:03:02.432
It's a Ferrari.

01:03:03.238 --> 01:03:05.891
- Does it run?
- "Does it run?"

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:08.492
She won the Grand Prix last year.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:11.537
Bought it from Simonelli's widow.
Gave her 100 quid for it.

01:03:11.538 --> 01:03:13.414
What are you going to do with it?

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:15.488
Race it, of course.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:17.406
You?

01:03:17.669 --> 01:03:20.697
Me. You needn't sound
so pessimistic.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:23.533
I've always wanted to,
just never could afford it.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.953
Sixth of August, if the
Commander gets me back in time.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.422
You're going to kill yourself.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:33.084
It's possible.

01:03:36.604 --> 01:03:38.347
Julian?

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:42.518
When was it you were in
love with me and I...

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:44.562
And you were so stupid about it?

01:03:44.779 --> 01:03:47.432
And I was so stupid about it.

01:03:47.574 --> 01:03:51.854
You should have grabbed me,
you know. I'm about to be extinct.

01:03:52.996 --> 01:03:56.741
I came here tonight, Julian,
because I want to know.

01:03:58.043 --> 01:04:00.161
Are you still...

01:04:00.754 --> 01:04:02.406
I'm serious.

01:04:13.808 --> 01:04:18.213
In a normal world, I think I
would still be in love with you.

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:20.890
Yes or no, Julian?

01:04:22.317 --> 01:04:24.902
But lately, with so
little time left,

01:04:24.903 --> 01:04:28.147
my sense of values
seem to have changed.

01:04:32.744 --> 01:04:34.646
No, then?

01:04:36.373 --> 01:04:40.000
I'm such a fake, such a
lot of meaningless talk.

01:04:40.001 --> 01:04:43.337
- Now, now, don't say that.
- Yes, it's true.

01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:46.161
There have been men, lots of men.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:50.427
And every time one fell out,
there was always a replacement.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.581
But not one of them
meant anything to me.

01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:57.585
I can't pretend any longer, Julian.

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:00.012
I'm afraid.

01:05:00.814 --> 01:05:04.514
I have nobody, and I'm afraid.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:16.484
What about Dwight?

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:20.024
He's married.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:23.532
He's married to a
girl named Sharon.

01:05:23.711 --> 01:05:26.864
- And they have two children.
- I know.

01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:30.551
But if things were different,

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.796
if she were alive, I'd do anything.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:37.128
Any mean trick I know to get him.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:43.882
Even if I could make him forget,

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:46.426
there isn't time.

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:49.182
No time to love

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:53.891
and nothing to remember.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.904
Nothing worth remembering.

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.450
I can't go home tonight, Julian.

01:06:04.210 --> 01:06:06.612
May I stay here with you?

01:06:08.506 --> 01:06:12.706
It's late, and I have to pick
up some things before we leave.

01:06:13.845 --> 01:06:17.374
Leave? You're leaving?

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.218
At 6:00 this morning.

01:06:28.359 --> 01:06:30.511
He didn't tell you.

01:06:46.336 --> 01:06:47.953
Come on.

01:06:48.755 --> 01:06:50.907
I'll take you home.

01:07:19.619 --> 01:07:22.021
Got 56 feet, sir.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.984
I recommend course 045, Captain.

01:07:26.334 --> 01:07:29.211
Right rudder, new course, 045.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:33.131
- Right rudder, new course, 045, sir.
- Check sonar.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.660
Fogarty, how's it look topside?

01:07:37.095 --> 01:07:39.998
All clear for about a
mile, scattered icebergs.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.183
This looks like the spot.

01:07:43.184 --> 01:07:45.310
- All stop.
- All stop!

01:07:45.311 --> 01:07:47.338
Up periscope.

01:07:56.614 --> 01:07:59.733
Okay. I got Point Barrow.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:03.696
Bearing, 130 relative.

01:08:04.122 --> 01:08:05.774
Distance.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.114
- About seven miles.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:08:10.628 --> 01:08:13.547
All right, Mr. Osborn. You
can take your readings now.

01:08:13.548 --> 01:08:17.077
- Chief, raise the E.C.M.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:24.925
E.C.M. fully extended, sir.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.740
It's hot, isn't it?

01:08:52.295 --> 01:08:56.916
It's hotter than it is in mid-Pacific,
at least 30 points in the red.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:09:01.037
That takes care of
Jorgensen's theory.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.678
Well, we've got another job to do.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:16.943
Let's get the hell out of here.
What's the course, Bob?

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.687
225, sir.

01:09:19.029 --> 01:09:22.104
Down periscope and E.C.M.

01:09:22.367 --> 01:09:26.495
Course 225. All ahead, standard.
Take her to 100 feet.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.206
- Course 225. All ahead, standard.
- Just like that?

01:09:29.207 --> 01:09:30.999
Take her to 100 feet, sir.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.620
Fogarty, will you get us
out of this deep freeze?

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:39.966
When we're clear of Bering Strait,
set a course for San Francisco.

01:09:39.966 --> 01:09:41.960
Aye, aye, sir.

01:10:06.911 --> 01:10:09.029
Julian?

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.322
You ever been to San Francisco?

01:10:20.091 --> 01:10:22.038
Yes, I have.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:26.042
A week on the way down,
met a lovely girl.

01:10:26.597 --> 01:10:28.849
Longest, loveliest
legs I've ever seen.

01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:30.851
Full of martinis, both of them.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:33.050
The legs, I mean.

01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:38.926
It got to you, didn't it?

01:10:42.238 --> 01:10:44.015
You know...

01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:47.856
I've been trying to

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.359
get Mary to face up to it.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:56.703
To make her understand what has
to be done when the time comes.

01:10:59.630 --> 01:11:01.373
But

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.544
she won't.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:07.872
She just won't.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.796
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:19.679
I don't think you'll have
to worry about Mary.

01:11:20.651 --> 01:11:23.930
You don't know, Julian.
You just don't know.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:26.740
You didn't see her face
when I told her...

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:31.149
She'd have to give Jennifer one of those
pills if it happened before I got back.

01:11:32.663 --> 01:11:36.237
You'd have thought I was
a murderer or something.

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.575
All I was doing was what
I felt I had to do.

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:46.843
How do you tell a woman you love that
she has to kill herself and her baby?

01:11:46.844 --> 01:11:48.917
How do you do it?

01:11:54.602 --> 01:11:56.549
I envy you.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:00.390
You envy me, do you?

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:04.679
You have someone to worry about.

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:08.190
I never envied anyone before.

01:12:08.574 --> 01:12:11.102
Never really believed in it.

01:12:11.202 --> 01:12:13.900
But you, yes, I do. I envy you.

01:12:14.038 --> 01:12:18.784
You have a wife and a
child, nappies to change.

01:12:20.753 --> 01:12:23.372
You have a lot to remember.

01:12:23.756 --> 01:12:27.217
You're fortunate to have
someone to worry about.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:30.011
There are those who
don't, you know?

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:32.915
I mean, have anyone to worry about.

01:12:35.101 --> 01:12:37.128
Moira, for one.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.968
Myself, for another.

01:12:40.523 --> 01:12:44.143
We let it all go by the
boards. It's too late now.

01:12:48.906 --> 01:12:52.606
But you, you've had it all.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:01.668
And I'll thank you not to bother me
with any more of your blubbering.

01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:06.449
I don't know why I like you so much,
Peter. You can be such an intolerable ass.

01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:30.932
Julian?

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:34.442
Julian?

01:13:42.001 --> 01:13:44.199
Now what the devil?

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:46.997
Thanks.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:52.552
What are you standing
there looking so silly for?

01:13:52.553 --> 01:13:55.581
I don't know. I just don't know.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:59.309
You're not losing your mind
or something, are you?

01:13:59.310 --> 01:14:01.712
No, I don't think so.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.021
You know,

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:16.368
if I can just get back in time, I don't
think I'll complain about a thing.

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:20.899
I think I could change Jennifer 24
hours a day and never complain.

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:21.891
Alcatraz Island on port beam,
sir. Range, 800 yards.

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:24.019
Suggest we come right
10 degrees, sir.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:26.980
- Right 10 degrees.
- Right 10 degrees, sir.

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.634
New course, 160.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.032
- All stop.
- All stop.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.106
Up both periscopes.

01:18:22.323 --> 01:18:25.742
Captain, San Francisco is
yeoman Swain's hometown.

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:28.145
He wants to take a look.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.691
Okay, let him look.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:48.382
- Still doesn't make any sense.
- Down San Diego way, all right.

01:18:49.600 --> 01:18:52.173
It's got to be hydroelectric.

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.103
Where could it be?

01:18:54.104 --> 01:18:56.773
Probably in one of the
refineries along the coast.

01:18:56.774 --> 01:19:00.144
They've got the transmitters
and lots of juice.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.771
See your house, Rob?

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:05.850
No, sir.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:09.603
You couldn't see it
from here anyway.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.982
It's up in the hills.

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.865
Seen enough?

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.411
Yes, sir. Thank you.

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:28.046
You know,

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:32.171
I seem to keep expecting
to see more damage.

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.344
There's no people.

01:19:35.145 --> 01:19:37.547
I wonder where they are.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:40.346
Dogs go somewhere to die.

01:19:40.734 --> 01:19:43.486
They don't want anybody
to look at them.

01:19:43.487 --> 01:19:46.185
Maybe people do the same thing,

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.400
go to bed.

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.274
Captain!

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.254
Swain's out through the
escape trunk, sir.

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:03.032
Out?

01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.968
Secure the loading hatch.
Drain the escape trunk.

01:20:06.969 --> 01:20:10.464
Why didn't somebody stop him?
Raise the boat!

01:20:24.528 --> 01:20:26.475
Give me that.

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:31.860
Swain, this is the
Captain. Hear this.

01:20:32.036 --> 01:20:34.609
Don't be a damn fool, Swain!

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:36.857
Come back right now, and
we'll take you aboard.

01:20:36.874 --> 01:20:39.000
But I mean right now!

01:20:39.001 --> 01:20:42.120
Swain, do you hear me?

01:20:42.421 --> 01:20:43.963
Swain!

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:48.460
I got a date on Market Street,
Captain. I'm going home!

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:58.804
Mr. Osborn.

01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:05.848
How long can he last out there?

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:10.307
Three or four days, a week.
Depends on the individual.

01:21:12.576 --> 01:21:15.703
We'd be safe to take
him back up till when?

01:21:15.704 --> 01:21:17.747
Up to not more than a few hours.

01:21:17.748 --> 01:21:20.583
Certainly not after he's eaten
or drunk something ashore.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:24.079
Then you might as well
take a time bomb aboard.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.725
It'll be dark in about an hour.

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:00.816
We'll set on the
bottom for the night.

01:22:01.291 --> 01:22:03.944
Secure the diving stations.

01:22:05.129 --> 01:22:07.281
Underway at 7:30.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:30.862
- Good morning, Swain.
- Hi, Captain.

01:22:30.863 --> 01:22:33.156
I thought you'd gone.

01:22:33.157 --> 01:22:36.026
- Catch anything?
- No, just started.

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:38.399
Always do though, out here.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.107
How are you feeling?

01:22:41.498 --> 01:22:42.990
Okay.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.293
My stomach was upset last night,

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:48.789
but I got some Alka-Seltzer
from the drugstore.

01:22:49.214 --> 01:22:52.208
I must have swallowed
some saltwater.

01:22:54.887 --> 01:22:57.415
What's it like in town?

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:03.299
Everybody's dead, I guess.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.348
My folks are.

01:23:07.900 --> 01:23:10.928
I didn't look much
after I saw a few.

01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:16.240
I got a case of good
beer, if you want any.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:18.143
No, thanks.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:24.112
Captain, how long is it
before I feel anything?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.119
A few days, a week.

01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:29.871
There's no rule.

01:23:32.549 --> 01:23:36.954
Well, the weather's okay, if the
wind would die down a little.

01:23:40.057 --> 01:23:42.808
Captain, I didn't mean any
disrespect or anything yesterday.

01:23:42.809 --> 01:23:45.803
I want you to
understand that, but...

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:50.775
I'd rather be home here to
have it than in Australia.

01:23:50.776 --> 01:23:52.473
You know what I mean?

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.112
I know what you mean.

01:23:55.113 --> 01:23:58.483
Is there anything you
want before we go?

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.814
I'm okay.

01:24:01.495 --> 01:24:03.863
We won't be coming back.

01:24:05.040 --> 01:24:06.657
I know.

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:10.570
You'll get pretty sick.

01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:13.616
Have you got anything to take?

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:17.168
I got 200 drugstores
to choose from.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.082
Good luck.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.961
Okay. Take it easy.

01:24:26.562 --> 01:24:29.841
Watch the suck of the props now.

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.417
- No soap, sir?
- Gibberish.

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:51.596
Can't make out a thing. I don't
know what the hell it is.

01:25:52.356 --> 01:25:55.179
Stay with it. Got to be somebody.

01:25:56.985 --> 01:26:00.696
You know, one of us was the
last man to see San Francisco,

01:26:00.697 --> 01:26:04.742
the last man alive next to Swain,
that is, and we didn't see much.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.535
Somebody ought to write
a history of the war.

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:09.914
What are you bucking for,
a whole chapter to yourself?

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:13.114
I doubt anyone could
put it all together.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:14.960
Well, if they do,
I'd like to read it.

01:26:14.961 --> 01:26:18.881
I was in it for a while, and I
didn't know anything about it.

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:22.912
I don't even know who started it.
I wish somebody had stopped it.

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:25.554
You know, the people on Mars
probably saw what happened.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:29.183
When things cool off, they'll
probably come down and take over.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:31.131
How about that,
Professor? Any chance?

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.731
They might have the means of
paying our corpse a visit,

01:26:35.732 --> 01:26:38.976
but I shouldn't advise
it for a long time.

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:42.305
Who do you think
started it, the war?

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:47.899
- Albert Einstein.
- You're kidding.

01:26:49.371 --> 01:26:52.581
Do you really want to know
who I think started the war?

01:26:52.582 --> 01:26:55.084
- Yeah.
- Why?

01:26:55.085 --> 01:26:57.738
You're an egghead, aren't you?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:03.092
Who would ever have believed that
human beings would be stupid enough

01:27:03.093 --> 01:27:06.212
to blow themselves off
the face of the earth?

01:27:06.596 --> 01:27:08.848
I don't believe it even now.

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:12.173
We didn't want a war.
We didn't start it.

01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:14.254
How did it start?

01:27:14.271 --> 01:27:16.814
The trouble with you is
you want a simple answer,

01:27:16.815 --> 01:27:19.013
and there isn't any.

01:27:21.820 --> 01:27:25.114
The war started when people
accepted the idiotic principle

01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:28.534
that peace could be
maintained by arranging

01:27:28.535 --> 01:27:32.690
to defend themselves with weapons
they couldn't possibly use

01:27:33.331 --> 01:27:35.733
without committing suicide.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.378
Everybody had an atomic bomb

01:27:39.379 --> 01:27:41.297
and counter-bombs and
counter-counter bombs.

01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:44.872
The devices outgrew us.
We couldn't control them.

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:47.378
I know.

01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:52.049
I helped build them. God help me.

01:27:58.023 --> 01:28:01.901
Somewhere some poor bloke
probably looked at a radar screen

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:04.521
and thought he saw something.

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:10.651
He knew that if he hesitated
one thousandth of a second,

01:28:10.827 --> 01:28:14.071
his own country would
be wiped off the map,

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:18.159
so he pushed a button.

01:28:19.211 --> 01:28:21.363
And...

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:24.745
The world went

01:28:25.926 --> 01:28:27.703
crazy.

01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:31.001
And...

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.923
And...

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:52.773
What's with him?

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:56.899
Maybe we shouldn't ask
him any more questions.

01:29:01.336 --> 01:29:03.254
What's new from San
Diego, Sundstrom?

01:29:03.255 --> 01:29:05.214
Still can't make it out, sir.

01:29:05.215 --> 01:29:07.709
We'll be there soon enough.

01:29:11.054 --> 01:29:13.081
Lungren.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:18.052
Sir?

01:29:18.311 --> 01:29:20.980
Mr. Osborn is doing
a good job for us.

01:29:20.981 --> 01:29:23.566
He's not used to this kind of duty.

01:29:23.567 --> 01:29:26.735
He's not feeling well, just
a little claustrophobia.

01:29:26.736 --> 01:29:30.114
- Beg your pardon, sir?
- Professor needs a drink.

01:29:30.115 --> 01:29:34.270
He's a civilian. He's used to
a shot or two before dinner.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:38.068
See what you can find
in the medical locker.

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:40.499
The closer you can come
to scotch, the better.

01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:41.992
Yes, sir.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:16.277
Pull it tighter!

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:18.871
Now I want you back
here in one hour.

01:30:18.872 --> 01:30:21.749
Ditch the boat, the suit,
the tank, everything.

01:30:21.750 --> 01:30:24.376
And take a shower in the
trunk for 10 minutes.

01:30:24.377 --> 01:30:25.961
And no souvenirs.

01:30:25.962 --> 01:30:29.707
All I want to see come
through that hatch is you.

01:30:29.966 --> 01:30:32.539
As naked as a baby, understand?

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:36.213
We'll give you a blast
every quarter hour.

01:30:36.973 --> 01:30:39.475
When you hear the
third quarter, get!

01:30:39.476 --> 01:30:43.597
I don't care if you find a tribe
of beautiful girls, eager!

01:30:43.605 --> 01:30:45.757
Get! And I mean it.

01:30:46.024 --> 01:30:48.722
Fan your tail for home.

01:32:02.058 --> 01:32:03.835
He's away.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:17.531
Check Jones.

01:32:17.532 --> 01:32:19.934
Sundstrom's away.
Still getting that signal?

01:32:20.035 --> 01:32:22.619
Off and on. They never went to
radio school, those spooks,

01:32:22.620 --> 01:32:24.647
that's for sure.

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:51.307
Amazing equipment
to last like that.

01:37:57.413 --> 01:38:02.068
Wind. Window shade tugging
on a Coke bottle.

01:38:09.300 --> 01:38:11.593
Say, what time is it in Melbourne?

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.416
1500, sir.

01:38:16.599 --> 01:38:19.218
I hope old Bridie's listening.

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:07.482
She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:09.151
So full of life.

01:39:09.152 --> 01:39:11.862
- Here you are, baby.
- And she always waits for the sugar.

01:39:11.863 --> 01:39:13.864
She knows she won't get
it if she doesn't.

01:39:13.865 --> 01:39:16.158
Go on, get out. Get.

01:39:16.159 --> 01:39:17.560
I'll bet she would.

01:39:18.327 --> 01:39:20.412
I'll bet if she sat down and
refused to do anything,

01:39:20.413 --> 01:39:22.907
she'd still get the sugar.

01:39:25.918 --> 01:39:28.412
He should be coming
home any day now.

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:33.079
- I'm not sure.
- Have you missed him?

01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.303
Terribly.

01:39:36.304 --> 01:39:38.832
Then why don't you tell him?

01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:43.423
Dwight?

01:40:01.204 --> 01:40:03.246
What a thing to do to me.

01:40:03.247 --> 01:40:05.524
I'd given you up.

01:40:06.709 --> 01:40:09.544
I thought the polar bears had you.

01:40:09.545 --> 01:40:13.173
Don't you ever do that to me again,
leave me without telling me.

01:40:13.174 --> 01:40:15.622
I don't think I will.

01:40:15.927 --> 01:40:18.929
You're thinner. You're not ill?

01:40:18.930 --> 01:40:22.209
No, no, a little tired.
I'm all right.

01:40:22.225 --> 01:40:23.558
You're sure about that?

01:40:23.559 --> 01:40:26.087
I'm positive, Ms. Davidson,

01:40:26.979 --> 01:40:29.347
I'm absolutely positive.

01:40:29.482 --> 01:40:32.484
Why didn't you telephone, let me
come and meet you at the station?

01:40:32.485 --> 01:40:35.513
I thought I'd walk.
I wanted the air.

01:40:36.989 --> 01:40:41.144
Is your invitation to spread a
little fertilizer still open?

01:40:42.495 --> 01:40:44.996
Can you stay for a few days?

01:40:44.997 --> 01:40:47.570
If you've got room for me.

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:50.494
I'd build a house if I didn't.

01:41:31.168 --> 01:41:34.129
Peter... Peter, I...

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:37.033
Darling, I'll never
leave you again.

01:41:56.319 --> 01:41:58.820
You might as well run a
railway train through here.

01:41:58.821 --> 01:42:00.071
I beg your pardon?

01:42:00.072 --> 01:42:02.282
There's no need to
frighten all the animals.

01:42:02.283 --> 01:42:04.685
Sorry, sorry.

01:42:06.996 --> 01:42:08.898
Julian.

01:42:09.790 --> 01:42:11.783
Hello, hello.

01:42:11.792 --> 01:42:14.502
The Admiral told me
I'd find you here.

01:42:14.503 --> 01:42:17.797
I thought you might want to have a look at
this report of mine before I have it typed.

01:42:17.798 --> 01:42:19.007
I'm sure it'll be all right.

01:42:19.008 --> 01:42:20.800
Well, you don't have to
be so noisy about it.

01:42:20.801 --> 01:42:22.510
The cows won't give
any milk for a week.

01:42:22.511 --> 01:42:23.845
He just said that.

01:42:23.846 --> 01:42:26.264
So this is the Ferrari?
What will she do?

01:42:26.265 --> 01:42:29.976
I don't really know yet, but
I'll find out on Saturday.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.686
You are coming to the
race, aren't you?

01:42:31.687 --> 01:42:33.355
Well, I'd like to.

01:42:33.356 --> 01:42:34.981
Will there be much of a crowd?

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.358
I shouldn't think so.

01:42:36.359 --> 01:42:38.735
It's a question of
transport for most people.

01:42:38.736 --> 01:42:40.945
Besides, nobody cares who wins.

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:43.031
I suppose you think
you're going to?

01:42:43.032 --> 01:42:44.908
I might. It's the
fastest car, you know.

01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:48.244
Commander, there's a
telephone call for you.

01:42:48.245 --> 01:42:51.319
All right. Be right back.

01:42:51.832 --> 01:42:54.709
Julian, this is ridiculous.

01:42:54.710 --> 01:42:56.953
Why are you doing it?

01:42:57.046 --> 01:42:58.588
Because I want to.

01:42:58.589 --> 01:43:00.382
I can't think of a better reason.

01:43:00.383 --> 01:43:02.467
You think it's that funny?

01:43:02.468 --> 01:43:06.372
In view of things, don't you?

01:43:09.308 --> 01:43:11.810
"From United States
Naval Forces, Brisbane.

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:16.314
"To Commander D.L. Towers,
USN, USS Sawfish.

01:43:16.315 --> 01:43:21.820
"One, on the retirement of the present
commander US Naval Forces at this date,

01:43:21.821 --> 01:43:24.114
"you will immediately and
henceforth assume the duty of

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:27.189
"Commander US Naval
Forces in all areas."

01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.371
I guess this makes you an
admiral, if you want to be one.

01:43:31.372 --> 01:43:33.240
Congratulations.

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:36.152
Thank you, sir.

01:43:37.128 --> 01:43:39.280
May I dictate something
to your secretary?

01:43:40.381 --> 01:43:42.882
Yes, I could let you
dictate something to her,

01:43:42.883 --> 01:43:46.386
but I tried to get through to
Brisbane myself half an hour ago.

01:43:46.387 --> 01:43:49.290
There was no reply.
They've closed up.

01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:51.799
I see.

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:57.176
Thank you, sir.

01:44:57.166 --> 01:44:59.284
He's moving up.

01:44:59.502 --> 01:45:03.406
I wish he'd be more careful.
It's not that important.

01:45:05.674 --> 01:45:07.291
It is to him.

01:45:51.011 --> 01:45:52.804
He almost had it that time.

01:45:52.805 --> 01:45:55.378
I can't watch much more
of this. Is Julian all right?

01:45:59.311 --> 01:46:01.713
He's all right. He's
back on the track.

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:30.511
Julian!

01:47:30.694 --> 01:47:32.654
He doesn't make the
slightest bit of sense.

01:47:32.655 --> 01:47:34.364
He's never been in a race before.

01:47:34.365 --> 01:47:35.937
Well, he won it, didn't he?

01:48:00.224 --> 01:48:02.922
I had lunch with Admiral
Bridie yesterday.

01:48:03.519 --> 01:48:06.688
He told me that somebody
brought pressure to bear

01:48:06.689 --> 01:48:09.592
and got the trout season moved up.

01:48:12.528 --> 01:48:14.601
It opens tomorrow.

01:48:16.949 --> 01:48:18.700
Why don't we have a crack at it,

01:48:18.701 --> 01:48:21.479
go up to the mountains
for a few days?

01:48:24.206 --> 01:48:25.498
When?

01:48:25.499 --> 01:48:26.946
Now.

01:48:27.710 --> 01:48:29.711
I know just the spot.

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:32.456
It's nice, quiet and peaceful.

01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:37.719
<i>Waltzing Matilda, waltzing Matilda</i>

01:48:37.720 --> 01:48:41.222
<i>You'll come a-waltzing
Matilda with me</i>

01:48:41.223 --> 01:48:43.433
<i>And he sang as he watched</i>

01:48:43.434 --> 01:48:45.768
<i>And waited fill his billy boiled</i>

01:48:52.067 --> 01:48:54.640
<i>Will you let loose of your line?</i>

01:48:58.282 --> 01:49:02.744
<i>And he sang as he stowed that
Jumbuck in his tucker-bag</i>

01:49:02.745 --> 01:49:07.248

<i>Up rode the squatter
Mounted on his thoroughbred</i>

01:49:29.772 --> 01:49:35.679
<i>Down came the troopers

01:49:35.778 --> 01:49:40.073
<i>Where's that jolly jumbuck
You've got in your tucker-bag</i>

<i>And he sang as he watched...</i>

<i>And he sang as he watched</i>

01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:26.828

<i>You'll come a-waltzing

01:50:53.564 --> 01:50:58.568
<i>Down came a jumbuck
To drink at that billabong</i>

01:50:58.569 --> 01:51:00.611
<i>Up jumped the swagman</i>

01:51:00.612 --> 01:51:04.031
<i>And grabbed him with glee</i>

01:51:04.032 --> 01:51:08.536
<i>And he sang as he stowed that
Jumbuck in his tucker-bag</i>

01:51:08.537 --> 01:51:13.541

<i>You'll come a-waltzing
Matilda with me</i>

01:51:43.447 --> 01:51:45.565
I'll build up the fire.

01:51:46.241 --> 01:51:50.494
<i>You'll come a-waltzing
Matilda with me</i>

01:51:50.495 --> 01:51:55.822
<i>Up jumped the swagman
Sprang into that billabong</i>

01:51:56.126 --> 01:51:59.503
<i>You'll never take me alive</i>

01:51:59.504 --> 01:52:01.923
<i>Said he</i>

01:52:01.924 --> 01:52:05.426
<i>And his ghost may be heard</i>

01:52:05.427 --> 01:52:10.378
<i>As you pass by that billabong</i>

01:52:10.474 --> 01:52:15.880
<i>You'll never take me alive</i>

01:52:15.979 --> 01:52:19.982
<i>Said he</i>

01:52:19.983 --> 01:52:22.886
<i>Waltzing Matilda</i>

01:52:22.986 --> 01:52:25.988

<i>You'll come a-waltzing Matilda</i>

01:52:30.994 --> 01:52:34.497
<i>With me</i>

01:52:34.498 --> 01:52:39.543
<i>And his ghost may be heard</i>

<i>As you pass by that billabong</i>

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:50.554
<i>You'll come a-waltzing</i>

01:52:50.555 --> 01:52:54.058
<i>Matilda</i>

01:52:54.059 --> 01:52:58.965
<i>With me</i>

01:53:13.036 --> 01:53:15.037
Captain.

01:53:15.038 --> 01:53:17.941
You'd better have a
look at Ackerman.

01:53:19.042 --> 01:53:22.545
Ackerman? What's wrong with him?

01:53:22.546 --> 01:53:24.547
The doctor says he's in a bad way.

01:53:24.548 --> 01:53:26.950
You'd better have a look at him.

01:53:29.052 --> 01:53:30.920
I'll go right down.

01:53:37.519 --> 01:53:40.422
Do that again, baby, will ya?

01:53:45.027 --> 01:53:46.527
- Hello, Ackerman.
- Hello, Captain.

01:53:46.528 --> 01:53:48.529
How are you feeling?

01:53:48.530 --> 01:53:52.230
I'm okay, except I'm a little weak.

01:53:52.534 --> 01:53:55.938
Can't seem to keep anything
in my stomach yet.

01:53:56.371 --> 01:54:00.241
Guess I hoisted a few too
many beers the other night.

01:54:00.667 --> 01:54:04.337
You know, I don't know what the kangaroos
are putting in the brew nowadays,

01:54:04.338 --> 01:54:07.662
but I can sure tell you
what it tastes like.

01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:11.427
- You just take it easy.
- Yeah.

01:54:11.428 --> 01:54:13.922
You'll be perfectly okay.

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:17.550
- Dr. King here will look after you.
- I'll do fine.

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:36.452
Any chance that he's right?
He just had a few too many?

01:54:36.453 --> 01:54:39.902
No, he has the full
range of symptoms.

01:54:40.290 --> 01:54:42.237
It's radiation.

01:54:44.586 --> 01:54:46.158
Why...

01:54:46.588 --> 01:54:48.589
Why this one case all of a sudden?

01:54:48.590 --> 01:54:51.743
Why? Why not? It's here.

01:54:52.636 --> 01:54:55.880
It had to hit somebody
first. It hit this lad.

01:54:56.098 --> 01:55:00.628
We're not machines. We're not going
to fall over in rows, you know.

01:55:07.943 --> 01:55:10.766
- Anything you can do for him?
- No.

01:55:11.071 --> 01:55:14.315
Except make him as
comfortable as possible.

01:55:21.623 --> 01:55:24.867
This thing is coming
sooner than we thought.

01:55:28.588 --> 01:55:31.161
I'm a little off balance.

01:55:31.299 --> 01:55:34.248
I'm terribly sorry if
it's inconvenient,

01:55:34.428 --> 01:55:37.547
but I'm afraid I can't be
held responsible for that.

01:55:37.639 --> 01:55:40.417
I never predicted the precise date.

01:55:45.647 --> 01:55:49.517
No, I don't think we have a
freak case here, Commander.

01:55:49.776 --> 01:55:53.430
I've been getting very irritable
myself, as you can see.

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:56.858
It's one of the first symptoms.

01:56:33.778 --> 01:56:37.531
O lord, give us the strength.

01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:42.286
Help us to understand the reason
for this madness on earth,

01:56:42.287 --> 01:56:45.611
the reason why we have
destroyed ourselves.

01:56:46.124 --> 01:56:49.619
Give us the courage
to bear thy will,

01:56:49.628 --> 01:56:52.030
and when the end is upon us,

01:56:52.130 --> 01:56:55.875
give us thy hand and
show us the way.

01:56:56.051 --> 01:57:01.305
That we may better understand
that only you can give,

01:57:01.306 --> 01:57:04.084
and only you can take away.

01:57:04.768 --> 01:57:07.770
Forgive those of us who are weak,

01:57:07.771 --> 01:57:10.940
as we forgive each other.

01:57:10.941 --> 01:57:14.436
For Jesus' sake. Amen.

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:19.182
Simpson, John.

01:57:23.328 --> 01:57:27.904
Jones, Norman, Molly,
Kenneth and Kim.

01:57:53.066 --> 01:57:56.140
Dickson, George and Lola.

01:58:12.794 --> 01:58:15.162
You all know the situation.

01:58:15.630 --> 01:58:19.800
I've given leave to many of you,
to stay here for personal reasons.

01:58:19.801 --> 01:58:23.045
It's understandable why some
of you might prefer this.

01:58:23.513 --> 01:58:28.419
I think that the rest of you are entitled
to decide what you'd like to do.

01:58:31.563 --> 01:58:35.934
I'd like you to think about it.
Take a vote if you need to.

01:58:36.526 --> 01:58:38.849
Give me your decision
by this evening.

01:58:39.195 --> 01:58:40.946
I think that's all.

01:58:40.947 --> 01:58:42.564
Captain.

01:58:44.242 --> 01:58:46.235
We've already taken a vote.

01:58:50.290 --> 01:58:52.067
We'd like to head for home.

01:59:03.011 --> 01:59:06.013
Just give it to me straight.
How much longer?

01:59:06.014 --> 01:59:08.515
We're 15 points in the red.

01:59:08.516 --> 01:59:11.510
Up three and a half
since last night.

01:59:17.359 --> 01:59:20.057
I suppose you've heard about Mary.

01:59:21.029 --> 01:59:22.772
No. What?

01:59:23.031 --> 01:59:24.865
Quite irrational.

01:59:24.866 --> 01:59:27.951
Peter came in Sunday to find her
packing for a trip back to England,

01:59:27.952 --> 01:59:29.945
taking Jennifer.

01:59:31.164 --> 01:59:32.456
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:59:32.457 --> 01:59:35.701
She's a bit calmer now,
doctor and all that.

01:59:37.212 --> 01:59:38.295
Dwight?

01:59:38.296 --> 01:59:39.913
Yes?

01:59:40.048 --> 01:59:42.291
What about Moira?

01:59:45.595 --> 01:59:47.554
I want to stay with
her right to the end,

01:59:47.555 --> 01:59:50.458
but I had to leave it to the men.

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:52.961
We're going.

01:59:55.980 --> 01:59:58.007
When do you leave?

01:59:58.566 --> 02:00:00.818
In a day, two at the most.

02:00:00.819 --> 02:00:02.736
You might not have that much time.

02:00:02.737 --> 02:00:04.480
Yes, I know.

02:00:04.948 --> 02:00:07.646
I've got to see her right away.

02:00:19.921 --> 02:00:21.789
So long, Julian.

02:00:23.007 --> 02:00:24.784
God bless.

02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:34.252
Hosgood?

02:00:38.732 --> 02:00:40.679
Hosgood?

02:00:46.614 --> 02:00:48.687
Yes, sir?

02:00:49.409 --> 02:00:52.062
It looks as if we've
had it, Hosgood.

02:00:53.288 --> 02:00:57.693
Would you like shore leave
or are you staying aboard?

02:01:01.671 --> 02:01:04.574
I'm remaining aboard, sir.

02:01:08.553 --> 02:01:12.457
Would you have a glass of
sherry with an old man?

02:01:13.141 --> 02:01:15.384
No, sir,

02:01:15.935 --> 02:01:19.464
but I would very much like
to have one with you,

02:01:20.064 --> 02:01:21.932
sir.

02:01:34.245 --> 02:01:37.748
There's one thing that
always bothered me, Hosgood.

02:01:37.749 --> 02:01:43.576
A girl like you...
Why no young men?

02:01:44.255 --> 02:01:46.953
They never asked me.

02:01:51.262 --> 02:01:54.632
I guess maybe it was the uniform.

02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:00.554
To a blind...

02:02:02.357 --> 02:02:04.225
Blind world.

02:02:17.747 --> 02:02:20.249
I think I can get Mrs. Andrews
to help me out with Jennifer.

02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:24.002
Yes, but if you need anything,
you'd better call me.

02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:28.499
I'm sure she'll be all right, but I wish
there was something I could do for Mary.

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.505
Mary, Mary.

02:02:37.392 --> 02:02:39.635
Moira, it's for you.

02:02:45.316 --> 02:02:47.764
Hello. Dwight.

02:02:51.072 --> 02:02:54.741
Yes, I'll be there!
Right away, Dwight!

02:02:54.742 --> 02:02:56.485
I'll be there!

02:05:51.544 --> 02:05:53.161
Moira!

02:06:04.891 --> 02:06:07.214
You're not going.

02:06:07.226 --> 02:06:10.049
- You're staying. You're staying.
- No.

02:06:10.063 --> 02:06:11.813
I'm going.

02:06:11.814 --> 02:06:16.060
- But the Sawfish...
- Just across the bay

02:06:16.652 --> 02:06:18.554
at the fuel depot.

02:06:19.989 --> 02:06:22.858
The men want to try to get home.

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:28.272
I can't explain it.

02:06:31.876 --> 02:06:36.281
Then I suppose that the
time has come to say,

02:06:36.297 --> 02:06:39.701
"it's been nice, Dwight Lionel.

02:06:41.511 --> 02:06:43.834
"It's been everything."

02:06:45.264 --> 02:06:49.259
Dwight, I'm so frightened.

02:06:51.479 --> 02:06:53.426
I know.

02:06:56.484 --> 02:07:00.229
I'm so sorry for so many things.

02:07:03.116 --> 02:07:05.189
I love you, Moira.

02:07:05.785 --> 02:07:07.687
I love you.

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:14.735
I love you.

02:07:40.528 --> 02:07:42.100
Mary.

02:07:51.747 --> 02:07:53.319
Mary.

02:07:58.546 --> 02:08:00.323
I love you.

02:08:01.716 --> 02:08:04.335
Did you say something, Peter?

02:08:04.802 --> 02:08:06.749
I didn't hear.

02:08:07.805 --> 02:08:10.048
I said, "I love you."

02:08:26.240 --> 02:08:31.111
I... I feel so strange.

02:08:38.127 --> 02:08:41.371
You remember the first
time we ever met?

02:08:44.091 --> 02:08:46.289
It was on the beach.

02:08:49.013 --> 02:08:52.641
I thought you were everything
I'd ever dreamed about,

02:08:52.642 --> 02:08:55.170
everything I ever wanted.

02:08:56.103 --> 02:08:58.847
I thought you were so underfed.

02:09:05.780 --> 02:09:09.104
Every day after that,
I went to the beach,

02:09:09.283 --> 02:09:11.606
but you were never there.

02:09:12.119 --> 02:09:16.149
I had the flu. My mother
made me stay at home.

02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.292
I looked for you.

02:09:19.293 --> 02:09:21.661
I looked for you so.

02:09:22.797 --> 02:09:25.291
Did you suffer horribly?

02:09:26.926 --> 02:09:30.125
Mary, you'll never know.

02:09:30.638 --> 02:09:32.631
Did you really?

02:09:33.766 --> 02:09:37.386
I thought I couldn't bear it
if I didn't see you again.

02:09:39.313 --> 02:09:41.815
I'd about given up hope,

02:09:41.816 --> 02:09:44.139
but one day,

02:09:44.694 --> 02:09:46.767
there you were.

02:09:50.825 --> 02:09:53.569
Now it's all over, isn't it?

02:09:57.623 --> 02:09:59.696
It's all over.

02:10:06.674 --> 02:10:08.826
And I want you to know

02:10:09.927 --> 02:10:14.457
that I could never have been happy
with anyone in the world but you.

02:10:15.391 --> 02:10:17.885
I've loved you, Peter.

02:10:18.978 --> 02:10:22.147
I've been foolish,

02:10:22.148 --> 02:10:24.596
and I haven't been practical,

02:10:25.401 --> 02:10:28.145
but I've loved you so much.

02:10:28.529 --> 02:10:30.181
So much.

02:10:32.992 --> 02:10:35.895
We've been happy and fortunate.

02:10:36.996 --> 02:10:38.943
And Jennifer...

02:10:44.211 --> 02:10:46.909
She'll never have the chance.

02:10:48.174 --> 02:10:50.952
She'll never know what love is.

02:10:51.969 --> 02:10:56.249
- Peter, Peter, you'll see that she's...
- I will, I will.

02:11:13.908 --> 02:11:15.935
Darling.

02:11:18.454 --> 02:11:20.856
God!

02:11:21.957 --> 02:11:24.655
God forgive us.

02:11:30.341 --> 02:11:32.163
Peter,

02:11:32.885 --> 02:11:36.880
I think I'll have
that cup of tea now.
