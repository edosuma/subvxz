WEBVTT

01:06.376 --> 01:07.709
You knew.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.376
No.

01:09.667 --> 01:11.709
You knew what he was
planning to do.

01:13.334 --> 01:14.292
No.

01:15.709 --> 01:18.209
You're saying he never
spoke of defection?

01:18.959 --> 01:21.292
The subject never came up.

01:21.626 --> 01:23.376
He never spoke of it?

01:23.501 --> 01:24.501
Never.

01:25.834 --> 01:27.709
This is an attack

01:27.834 --> 01:29.417
upon the Soviet Union.

01:30.001 --> 01:31.001
No.

01:32.376 --> 01:33.376
It's about dance.

01:34.626 --> 01:35.459
Dance?

01:35.584 --> 01:37.876
He knows nothing about politics.

01:38.042 --> 01:41.667
He's gone to the West because
there he can dance.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.417
He could dance here.

01:45.001 --> 01:46.667
Yes, but...

01:53.501 --> 01:56.876
I think it's likely he had
an explosion of character.

02:00.001 --> 02:02.251
That's who he is.

03:00.792 --> 03:02.001
Mother will recover.

04:13.917 --> 04:17.375
After immigration return your passport.

05:18.292 --> 05:20.667
We are delighted to be here.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.084
Where are you off to?

07:00.334 --> 07:01.251
For a walk.

07:02.501 --> 07:04.001
Want me to come with you?

07:07.792 --> 07:08.876
Class in two hours.

07:09.167 --> 07:10.376
I won't forget.

07:14.251 --> 07:16.167
Keep an eye on him.

07:50.626 --> 07:52.251
Where are you from?

09:18.501 --> 09:20.626
I have a place - I'm dancing!

09:43.042 --> 09:44.667
Have you seen the list?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.251
I haven't looked.

09:46.626 --> 09:47.501
It's posted.

09:48.126 --> 09:50.209
I still haven't looked.

09:50.626 --> 09:53.709
Don't you want to know?
Sergeyev's not giving you the first night.

10:02.751 --> 10:04.292
I'm very sorry.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.001
What difference does it make?

10:06.126 --> 10:07.292
It's not going to take long.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.001
What's not going to take long?

10:09.917 --> 10:11.751
Until everyone knows who I am.

10:29.959 --> 10:33.042
Arms soft. Soft arms.

11:43.001 --> 11:44.167
What are you doing here?

11:45.209 --> 11:46.501
Are you in charge?

11:46.834 --> 11:49.126
I'm Valentin Ivanovich Shelkov.

11:49.626 --> 11:51.334
I'm Rudolf Nureyev.

11:51.501 --> 11:53.084
I'm here to dance.

11:53.376 --> 11:55.042
Are you out of your head?

11:55.251 --> 11:56.709
I've been accepted as a pupil.

11:56.917 --> 11:58.126
I've come from Ufa.

11:58.376 --> 11:59.834
Really?

12:00.709 --> 12:03.001
You've got the wrong date.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.959
Come back in a week.

12:14.417 --> 12:17.001
This is where you will all be living.

12:36.626 --> 12:39.959
Young man, turn your head.

12:42.834 --> 12:45.376
And lower your shoulder.

12:53.459 --> 12:54.792
It's not working for me.

12:54.917 --> 12:56.209
What do you mean?

12:56.334 --> 12:57.584
What I say.

12:57.834 --> 12:58.959
It's not working.

12:59.084 --> 13:01.209
The school is not for you?

13:01.334 --> 13:03.292
You only arrived a few weeks ago.

13:03.834 --> 13:05.001
Four.

13:06.126 --> 13:07.959
The Leningrad Choreographic School

13:08.084 --> 13:10.876
is thought to be the greatest
ballet institute in the world.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.292
You're the first pupil to complain.

13:16.834 --> 13:20.334
Shelkov says your
technique is inadequate.

13:20.459 --> 13:24.459
You lack control. You're clumsy.

13:24.584 --> 13:26.917
We know you're talented,

13:27.042 --> 13:28.001
but you're old.

13:28.126 --> 13:29.751
That's why I have to catch up.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.167
You're way behind.

13:31.292 --> 13:35.126
I'm seventeen. I have to do
six years' work in three.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.292
Well? What's stopping you?

13:37.667 --> 13:39.167
I'm ready to work.

13:39.501 --> 13:41.459
But not with Shelkov, is
that what you mean?

13:45.917 --> 13:48.042
Ballet is about rules.

13:48.667 --> 13:51.501
It's about discipline.
It has to be.

13:52.001 --> 13:54.792
That means it's about obedience.

13:55.376 --> 13:58.126
Only through discipline
can you find freedom.

13:58.251 --> 14:00.459
I'd rather die than live
under the rules.

14:00.584 --> 14:03.917
One day you might be good
enough to say that.

14:04.042 --> 14:06.334
You're not good enough yet.

14:07.084 --> 14:09.001
Far from it.

14:09.126 --> 14:12.459
I believe I would progress
faster with another teacher.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.001
Which teacher do you
have in mind?

14:53.876 --> 14:56.292
- Hello.
- Hello.

15:04.334 --> 15:07.334
- You're Rudolf Nureyev?
- Yes.

15:07.792 --> 15:09.834
I'm Alexander Ivanovich Pushkin.

15:11.917 --> 15:14.417
You'll find some space over there.

15:21.251 --> 15:22.292
Take a bow.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.959
- Is everybody warmed up?
- Yes.

15:39.459 --> 15:44.584
Boys, as usual, two demi pliÃ©s and
one grand pliÃ© in each position.

15:45.084 --> 15:47.084
Get ready.

15:50.084 --> 15:51.251
Please.

16:01.167 --> 16:02.917
Bend back, further back.

16:11.126 --> 16:12.917
Hold your back straight.

16:14.834 --> 16:16.667
Fifth position.

17:09.459 --> 17:11.791
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.001
What?

17:58.209 --> 17:59.751
The Raft?

18:01.959 --> 18:04.459
I want The Raft to myself.

19:33.042 --> 19:36.084
Rudik! Come and join in!

19:54.709 --> 19:56.459
Come over here.

19:57.959 --> 19:58.876
Are you alright?

19:59.167 --> 20:00.251
Yes.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.417
Am I pleasing you?

21:53.501 --> 21:54.667
I'm sorry?

21:54.792 --> 21:56.834
You never say anything to me.

21:58.917 --> 21:59.834
Oh.

22:00.167 --> 22:03.001
I just want to know if I'm
pleasing you.

22:04.167 --> 22:05.792
You don't displease me.

22:05.917 --> 22:08.667
Is that all you'll say?

22:08.834 --> 22:11.167
Listen, you're an intelligent man.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.584
Work it out for yourself.

22:14.251 --> 22:17.667
When you please me, you'll know.

22:21.501 --> 22:25.001
Steps have a logic.

22:26.084 --> 22:28.334
You need
to find that logic,

22:28.917 --> 22:30.667
not to force it.

22:31.834 --> 22:35.917
One step follows another, with no
impression of haste.

22:36.209 --> 22:37.376
Or effort.

22:38.126 --> 22:41.292
Steps follow. And belong.

22:46.042 --> 22:47.209
They...

22:47.917 --> 22:50.209
are interconnected.

22:59.501 --> 23:01.167
Thank you.

23:37.584 --> 23:39.334
This is impossible.

23:49.876 --> 23:52.417
Why aren't we talking to each other?

23:53.292 --> 23:54.876
This is ridiculous.

26:07.792 --> 26:10.167
Ladies, fouettÃ©s please.

26:21.209 --> 26:23.501
How was your class?

26:23.667 --> 26:25.876
We have various outings planned.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.501
All the main sights.

26:27.709 --> 26:30.251
The Louvre, The Eiffel Tower,
Notre Dame.

26:30.667 --> 26:32.584
Organised trips.

26:32.792 --> 26:34.167
That's nice.

26:36.209 --> 26:37.917
You haven't forgotten the
company meeting,

26:38.042 --> 26:39.501
before we left Leningrad?

26:39.626 --> 26:41.626
I never miss a meeting.

26:42.626 --> 26:43.501
We agreed

26:43.667 --> 26:45.126
we go together

26:45.417 --> 26:46.376
on the bus.

26:47.209 --> 26:48.376
Shall I put you down?

26:48.501 --> 26:49.417
Yes of course.

28:23.001 --> 28:26.459
My husband said you've not
been looking after yourself.

28:28.251 --> 28:30.751
I brought you some soup.

28:32.334 --> 28:34.376
It's not bad.

28:35.376 --> 28:38.417
He said you don't eat
with the others.

28:38.501 --> 28:41.917
A dancer needs to
look after his body.

28:43.917 --> 28:47.501
He says you react like an animal
who's been brought into the house.

28:48.126 --> 28:50.376
I didn't know
he'd noticed me.

28:50.876 --> 28:53.376
Oh yes, he's noticed you.

28:55.417 --> 28:57.084
This is French onion soup.

28:57.876 --> 28:59.917
Not quite how they make it in Paris.

29:00.584 --> 29:03.209
Not the right cheese.

29:03.501 --> 29:05.001
You've been to Paris?

29:05.126 --> 29:06.334
No.

29:07.709 --> 29:09.042
Have you been to London?

29:09.334 --> 29:11.376
I've only read about them.

29:12.042 --> 29:14.001
Which city is better?
Paris or London?

29:14.126 --> 29:16.084
Better for what?

29:16.459 --> 29:17.501
Better for life?
Better for ballet?

29:17.667 --> 29:18.626
Everything.

29:19.709 --> 29:23.251
They say Paris is more
beautiful - but London is special too.

29:23.376 --> 29:24.709
People know more about ballet?

29:24.834 --> 29:26.126
Maybe.

29:27.876 --> 29:29.917
Your husband is a good man.

29:30.334 --> 29:31.459
I think so.

29:31.584 --> 29:33.709
His class is two holy hours.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.292
Eat the soup.

29:40.626 --> 29:43.251
Don't worry, you will see
Paris one day.

31:35.167 --> 31:36.584
Sleep.

31:38.084 --> 31:40.167
I'll come back soon.

34:21.251 --> 34:23.208
You were spectacular!

34:25.376 --> 34:27.626
This is my friend, Clara Saint.

34:35.083 --> 34:36.833
It was wonderful!

35:23.167 --> 35:24.709
Rudi, are you coming with us?

35:24.834 --> 35:25.834
Not now.

35:25.959 --> 35:27.126
That's a pity.

41:15.167 --> 41:17.959
Alright,
what did you see?

42:18.959 --> 42:19.959
You came.

42:20.084 --> 42:20.959
Liuba.

42:21.292 --> 42:22.876
Hello - Cakes.

42:23.167 --> 42:26.584
Thank you. Come in.

42:32.084 --> 42:34.334
Everyone, attention.

42:34.501 --> 42:36.501
This is Rudolf Nureyev.

42:36.667 --> 42:40.167
We met at the Leningrad Choreographic
School's graduation evening.

42:40.292 --> 42:42.001
He's a dancer.

42:42.292 --> 42:43.417
Hello everybody.

42:43.792 --> 42:44.667
Hello.

42:44.792 --> 42:47.709
And also - he says he's been going to
the Hermitage every day.

42:47.834 --> 42:49.501
- He goes to the Hermitage every day?
- Yes.

42:49.626 --> 42:52.251
And - I told him a lot of us
spend time in the Hermitage.

42:52.792 --> 42:54.917
And that we all like to meet every
Sunday afternoon

42:55.042 --> 42:59.042
- a whole lot of us -
to talk, to talk about

42:59.376 --> 43:02.584
- all sorts of things -

43:02.709 --> 43:05.834
life, art, science -

43:05.959 --> 43:09.167
and that he would be very
welcome to join us.

43:09.709 --> 43:10.834
I won't stay long.

43:10.959 --> 43:14.834
Stay as long as you like.
Everyone else does.

43:15.709 --> 43:16.917
I don't want to be a
trouble.

43:17.251 --> 43:18.501
You're no trouble.

43:18.876 --> 43:21.667
This is my brother Leonid,
we are twins.

43:21.792 --> 43:22.709
Hello.

43:22.834 --> 43:25.251
Your sister started telling
me about Rembrandt.

43:25.501 --> 43:26.667
I want to find out as much as I can.

43:27.292 --> 43:28.376
Rembrandt?

43:29.084 --> 43:30.876
Leonid's a student at the
Polytechnic, like me.

43:32.792 --> 43:34.167
I will have a drink and then go.

43:34.459 --> 43:36.459
No. Have a drink and stay.

43:36.834 --> 43:39.751
C'mon sit with us.
- C'mon, c'mon.

44:29.501 --> 44:34.501
It's a good time. There's
never been a better time.

44:34.917 --> 44:38.167
What, just because we're
going to send a man into space?

44:38.501 --> 44:40.501
If you think about it,

44:40.834 --> 44:42.834
the Soviet Union's not even
fifty years old

44:43.126 --> 44:44.417
and yet we've caught up.

44:44.834 --> 44:45.917
Ahead of the Americans!

44:46.792 --> 44:48.792
Yes, ahead of the
Americans - yes!

44:48.959 --> 44:52.834
We went through terrible times.

44:53.167 --> 44:54.667
But they're over.

44:55.667 --> 44:57.709
The bad times are
behind us now.

45:16.084 --> 45:20.709
Rembrandt Harmenszoon van
Rijn, born in Leiden 1606.

45:20.834 --> 45:22.667
One of nine children.

45:23.001 --> 45:27.167
Father a miller, mother
a baker's daughter.

45:29.376 --> 45:32.334
Introduces a new style of portraiture.

47:37.209 --> 47:38.792
Are you all right?

47:40.459 --> 47:42.917
Yes of course, why?

49:04.209 --> 49:06.792
Rudik, your Father has returned.

49:07.667 --> 49:09.751
Come and greet him.

50:42.084 --> 50:46.501
I was wondering if perhaps
you'd care to eat with us.

50:49.001 --> 50:50.292
Eat at your home?

50:50.417 --> 50:53.001
I've spoken to Alexander
Ivanovich about it.

50:53.251 --> 50:55.459
I'm afraid our quarters
are very modest.

50:55.584 --> 50:58.001
He wants me to come?

51:00.792 --> 51:02.709
We're here.

51:03.501 --> 51:05.501
Come in.

51:06.792 --> 51:10.001
Ah Rudolf, yes, good.

51:10.626 --> 51:12.084
Please, there's no need
for you to get up.

51:12.209 --> 51:15.709
I want to get up. And anyway
you're here to eat.

51:16.251 --> 51:18.001
Over here.

51:18.126 --> 51:19.459
Sit?

51:19.709 --> 51:23.126
Xenia tells me she's
been looking after you.

51:24.667 --> 51:26.292
I hope you don't mind.

51:26.417 --> 51:28.126
Why would I mind?

51:43.501 --> 51:46.626
I am of course interested...

51:47.792 --> 51:50.709
do you ever think about

51:51.417 --> 51:54.001
the purpose of dance?

51:54.501 --> 51:56.292
- The purpose?
- Yes.

51:56.417 --> 51:58.626
Nobody thinks about this.

51:58.751 --> 51:59.876
It's true.

52:00.292 --> 52:02.876
Why dance?

52:04.709 --> 52:06.626
To take the audience
somewhere else.

52:07.709 --> 52:08.376
Somewhere new.

52:08.501 --> 52:09.876
Yes of course.

52:11.167 --> 52:12.876
But why?

52:15.167 --> 52:16.292
Escape.

52:17.209 --> 52:18.834
Just that?

52:19.376 --> 52:21.876
Is life that awful then?

52:22.376 --> 52:24.751
And escape to what?

52:27.709 --> 52:31.709
You see, all the time I'm
teaching technique.

52:31.834 --> 52:33.959
That's all I do.

52:34.084 --> 52:35.417
However,

52:35.584 --> 52:37.209
it is good to remember -

52:37.334 --> 52:40.292
technique is only a means,

52:41.626 --> 52:43.667
not an end.

52:44.459 --> 52:47.167
"Oh he leapt perfectly."

52:47.292 --> 52:48.459
So what?

52:48.626 --> 52:53.709
"Oh she raised an arm,
it was perfect."

52:53.834 --> 52:54.709
So?

52:56.334 --> 53:00.459
We spend so much time on technique.

53:00.792 --> 53:03.459
It's all we think about.

53:03.709 --> 53:06.334
What should we think about?

53:07.709 --> 53:09.959
Story.

53:11.167 --> 53:14.167
What story do we
wish to tell?

53:15.251 --> 53:18.751
Why do so few people
ask themselves:

53:19.834 --> 53:23.417
"What do I wish to say?"

53:31.167 --> 53:34.751
You need to let your feelings
pour out.

54:04.501 --> 54:06.459
Let's stop here.

54:06.709 --> 54:09.334
Be more expressive
with your body.

56:23.626 --> 56:25.084
Sit down.

56:34.167 --> 56:35.917
I received this letter.

56:38.292 --> 56:41.251
I am being sent to the Ministry of Culture
of the Bashkirian Soviet Socialist Republic

56:41.376 --> 56:43.334
to apply there for future work.

56:43.501 --> 56:45.251
Yes. So?

56:45.459 --> 56:47.042
This will kill me.

56:47.292 --> 56:48.626
I don't want to go.

56:49.751 --> 56:52.042
It doesn't matter what you want.

56:52.251 --> 56:54.584
Do you know that I've been
offered three different places?

56:54.959 --> 56:56.084
I didn't know that.

56:56.209 --> 56:57.376
With three different
companies.

56:57.501 --> 56:59.334
The Bolshoi wants me.

56:59.834 --> 57:03.834
One day you can go to
the Bolshoi in Moscow.

57:04.167 --> 57:05.292
Why not?

57:05.417 --> 57:06.459
But first

57:06.584 --> 57:08.584
you have to go
and dance in Ufa.

57:08.834 --> 57:12.376
If I go to Ufa, I'll never
go to the Bolshoi.

57:13.209 --> 57:15.167
I'll be too old.

57:15.709 --> 57:19.501
Who do you think paid for
your education?

57:19.667 --> 57:21.167
Your parents?

57:23.501 --> 57:24.334
No.

57:25.376 --> 57:28.001
The State paid for you.

57:28.501 --> 57:29.626
Soviet people.

57:29.751 --> 57:32.459
Isn't it time you did them
the favour of saying thank you?

57:33.876 --> 57:38.292
Artists have responsibilities
just like everyone else.

57:38.917 --> 57:41.376
What, you think
you're above society?

57:41.501 --> 57:43.334
Go on, tell me.

57:43.459 --> 57:46.042
For three years you've only taken.

57:46.459 --> 57:48.501
Now you have to give something back.

57:48.667 --> 57:50.292
I give back on the stage.

57:50.417 --> 57:53.001
Yes, in Moscow, in Leningrad,
you're happy to go there.

57:53.126 --> 57:54.751
But what's wrong with Ufa?

57:55.001 --> 57:57.376
Do you look down
on the people?

57:57.501 --> 57:58.167
No.

57:58.292 --> 57:59.667
Your little home town.

57:59.792 --> 58:01.376
I give something no-one
else can give.

58:01.501 --> 58:02.501
Well? Who made you?

58:02.626 --> 58:04.376
Where do you come from?
Who raised you?

58:04.501 --> 58:05.917
How can you be like that?

58:26.501 --> 58:28.459
Why are you looking
so miserable?

58:30.084 --> 58:31.626
You know very well.

58:32.792 --> 58:33.917
Everyone knows.

58:36.501 --> 58:40.167
I want you to dance
with me, Rudi.

58:40.376 --> 58:41.459
What?

58:41.917 --> 58:42.876
Where?

58:43.459 --> 58:45.709
At the Kirov, where else?

58:46.042 --> 58:48.751
Did no-one tell you?
I've been ordered back home.

58:49.584 --> 58:50.626
To Ufa.

58:50.876 --> 58:52.292
Forget about that.

58:53.042 --> 58:54.042
What are you saying?

58:54.167 --> 58:55.917
I went to Moscow to plead.

58:58.167 --> 59:01.876
I'm asking if you want
to join the Kirov.

59:02.001 --> 59:04.459
Not in the corps de ballet.

59:04.584 --> 59:06.834
Partnering me.

59:07.417 --> 59:08.459
Partnering?

59:08.792 --> 59:10.084
A younger man...

59:10.209 --> 59:14.001
...and older woman.
Always a good combination.

59:14.126 --> 59:17.584
I'll make you look talented,

59:17.709 --> 59:19.251
you'll make me look young.

59:19.959 --> 59:21.376
Shall we try?

59:21.501 --> 59:23.417
Wait. Explain.
What happened?

59:23.667 --> 59:25.459
Somebody spoke
on your behalf.

59:25.584 --> 59:27.251
- Who?
- It's not important.

59:27.376 --> 59:28.584
Just be grateful.

59:28.709 --> 59:29.709
How? How did they do it?

59:29.834 --> 59:32.584
Not by spitting
in anyone's face.

59:33.209 --> 59:36.334
Artistic strategy, Rudi.

59:45.084 --> 59:49.792
Hold my wrist, and
then my hip.

59:51.042 --> 59:52.042
Like that.

59:52.667 --> 59:55.334
Little closer.
Play please.

01:00:11.001 --> 01:00:12.751
Look, look in my eyes.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:34.751
What happened?

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:38.709
Are you here to ask
stupid questions?

01:00:40.917 --> 01:00:43.209
- No.
- Everyone knows what happened.

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:44.501
I fell.

01:00:44.667 --> 01:00:46.042
I fell!

01:00:51.001 --> 01:00:52.751
I'm going to get
you out of here.

01:00:54.376 --> 01:00:55.751
You're going to
leave hospital.

01:00:56.917 --> 01:00:58.584
You need personal care.

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:03.792
They say I won't dance
for two years.

01:01:06.501 --> 01:01:08.376
They're wrong.

01:01:09.417 --> 01:01:10.917
And don't look at
me like that.

01:01:34.834 --> 01:01:36.126
It's impossible.

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:38.501
No. We'll do it.

01:01:56.001 --> 01:01:58.417
We'll live together
until you're well.

01:01:58.751 --> 01:02:00.501
I'll look after you.

01:02:44.834 --> 01:02:46.501
Good night.

01:03:42.667 --> 01:03:44.376
Give me a hand.

01:04:12.709 --> 01:04:14.626
Wait for me here.

01:08:00.001 --> 01:08:01.751
It was bound to happen.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:06.209
Sooner or later.

01:08:07.834 --> 01:08:09.751
Inevitable.

01:08:15.709 --> 01:08:16.834
It's not right.

01:08:16.959 --> 01:08:18.792
You need to do it.

01:08:37.042 --> 01:08:38.334
Good evening.

01:08:45.959 --> 01:08:47.126
Join me.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.084
You've got to be
fair to me, Rudi.

01:08:51.209 --> 01:08:54.167
I want to get to
bed earlier.

01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:05.126
And, what?

01:09:05.501 --> 01:09:07.209
You think I bear
down on you?

01:09:10.042 --> 01:09:13.209
Doesn't it occur to you? I have
someone bearing down on me.

01:09:13.501 --> 01:09:16.042
They're all over me.

01:09:16.792 --> 01:09:19.834
And they are much less
pleasant than I am.

01:09:21.667 --> 01:09:23.251
Look at it through my eyes.

01:09:24.376 --> 01:09:25.501
I'm trying.

01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:32.501
They want to know why
I'm putting up with it.

01:09:34.959 --> 01:09:38.167
You don't just damage yourself
with your behaviour.

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:41.251
You endanger me.

01:09:43.584 --> 01:09:44.917
Is that it?

01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:47.959
No.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:49.501
It's not.

01:09:53.292 --> 01:09:55.417
You go out every evening
with this...

01:09:56.251 --> 01:09:57.334
Chilean girl.

01:09:58.876 --> 01:10:00.251
She's a friend.

01:10:00.376 --> 01:10:02.292
You go and watch
naked girls?

01:10:02.792 --> 01:10:04.584
It's fun, Vitaly Dimitrivich.

01:10:04.709 --> 01:10:05.667
Fun?

01:10:06.834 --> 01:10:08.751
And wealth is fun, is it?

01:10:11.334 --> 01:10:12.167
No.

01:10:12.292 --> 01:10:15.001
She's going to inherit a
fortune, is that right?

01:10:16.501 --> 01:10:18.376
You like that, do you?

01:10:18.751 --> 01:10:20.334
You like it.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:24.292
You like the
capitalist life?

01:10:25.084 --> 01:10:26.917
You stay out all night
walking with her.

01:10:28.376 --> 01:10:30.001
We've a lot to talk about.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:31.709
Not just her.

01:10:33.251 --> 01:10:34.834
Specifically:

01:10:35.501 --> 01:10:37.501
Western dancers...

01:10:37.917 --> 01:10:39.959
Western intellectuals.

01:10:41.751 --> 01:10:44.167
Rudi, it's bedtime.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:47.042
Well?

01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:49.751
They're just as late as I am.

01:10:50.126 --> 01:10:51.709
Why aren't you talking to them?

01:10:51.834 --> 01:10:54.626
Because I'm speaking to you.
You have a record.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.626
I'm not interested
in politics.

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:12.667
How long will you dance?

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:14.001
How long?

01:11:14.126 --> 01:11:15.417
How many years?

01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:20.834
How long do you
see yourself dancing?

01:11:23.959 --> 01:11:25.209
Twenty.

01:11:26.251 --> 01:11:27.251
Thirty.

01:11:28.626 --> 01:11:29.626
Thirty.

01:11:32.209 --> 01:11:35.209
And you want to travel
abroad in the future,

01:11:35.417 --> 01:11:37.751
you want to show the
world what you can do?

01:11:41.376 --> 01:11:46.084
This could be your last trip.

01:11:47.584 --> 01:11:51.417
If we decided to bring
a charge against you.

01:11:52.001 --> 01:11:54.251
What charge can you bring?

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:55.501
Please.

01:11:57.459 --> 01:11:59.501
Don't test our ingenuity.

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:06.292
This is a formal warning.

01:12:06.417 --> 01:12:10.126
I'm saying it so that when
we get back to Moscow,

01:12:10.251 --> 01:12:14.709
I can say: "I gave him
a formal warning."

01:12:14.834 --> 01:12:16.584
5:15 a.m.

01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:18.709
May 27th

01:12:18.834 --> 01:12:21.001
1961.

01:12:22.626 --> 01:12:23.834
Agree?

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:55.334
Tea is ready.

01:13:05.501 --> 01:13:07.209
We need to get you
some decent clothes.

01:13:08.417 --> 01:13:10.334
You're a leading
dancer at the Kirov.

01:14:00.751 --> 01:14:02.167
Teja -
come on.

01:14:06.417 --> 01:14:07.876
Good luck!

01:14:19.834 --> 01:14:22.876
You see, I told you...

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.417
You're right.

01:14:25.501 --> 01:14:27.209
The line isn't right.

01:14:28.376 --> 01:14:30.751
I'm not as good a dancer, but...

01:14:30.876 --> 01:14:33.042
even I can do it.

01:14:47.751 --> 01:14:49.709
The leg should be straighter.

01:14:49.834 --> 01:14:51.167
Look.

01:14:51.292 --> 01:14:54.667
And the head should
be higher. Far back.

01:14:54.792 --> 01:14:55.959
Yes.

01:15:08.042 --> 01:15:09.751
I can do better.

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:31.667
That was magnificent!

01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.834
You've never danced better.

01:15:35.792 --> 01:15:37.376
Did you feel the injury?

01:15:38.167 --> 01:15:39.251
No.

01:15:39.917 --> 01:15:41.626
You see - I said I would cure you.

01:15:42.792 --> 01:15:44.501
We can walk home together.

01:15:48.209 --> 01:15:49.584
Do you think we can do that?

01:15:53.001 --> 01:15:55.126
You're only guilty if you choose to be.

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.167
I don't choose to be.

01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:01.501
See you at home.

01:16:14.626 --> 01:16:15.959
Why are you still there?

01:16:18.459 --> 01:16:19.459
Where?

01:16:20.001 --> 01:16:21.334
At the Pushkins.

01:17:13.834 --> 01:17:16.334
It's his wife?

01:17:16.459 --> 01:17:18.792
Pushkin puts up with it because
he's too weak to say no.

01:17:24.959 --> 01:17:26.292
You like it, don't you?

01:18:03.959 --> 01:18:07.376
Why would I dream
of another world?

01:20:36.626 --> 01:20:39.709
The fish for Mademoiselle.

01:20:41.501 --> 01:20:44.667
And for Monsieur,
the steak.

01:20:46.084 --> 01:20:47.834
I hope you like them.

01:21:08.501 --> 01:21:10.292
How can I help?

01:21:16.667 --> 01:21:19.917
I'm sorry.
Just give us a moment.

01:21:37.834 --> 01:21:39.209
What is your problem?

01:21:46.459 --> 01:21:47.459
That's ridiculous.

01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:55.959
Again.

01:23:17.334 --> 01:23:18.501
No, no, not like that.

01:23:18.667 --> 01:23:19.792
Again

01:23:26.001 --> 01:23:27.792
What did you say?

01:23:28.959 --> 01:23:29.917
What?

01:23:30.042 --> 01:23:31.584
Are you talking about me?

01:23:33.209 --> 01:23:34.417
What's wrong with you?

01:23:34.501 --> 01:23:36.001
How dare you?

01:23:36.126 --> 01:23:38.626
You're not in
this ballet.

01:23:39.001 --> 01:23:40.334
You have no
right to be here.

01:23:40.459 --> 01:23:42.459
Rudi, please.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.001
Why are you here?

01:23:44.126 --> 01:23:47.209
Konstantin Mikhailovich is
the Senior Ballet Master with the Kirov.

01:23:47.334 --> 01:23:49.251
He can attend any
rehearsal he chooses.

01:23:49.376 --> 01:23:50.459
Maybe.

01:23:50.584 --> 01:23:51.667
Rudi...

01:23:53.001 --> 01:23:55.792
As it happens I wasn't
speaking about you.

01:23:56.917 --> 01:23:59.917
But if I want to speak, I will.

01:24:00.042 --> 01:24:02.709
The work we're doing is difficult.

01:24:03.001 --> 01:24:04.209
It's far too difficult for you.

01:24:04.334 --> 01:24:05.167
Rudi, please.

01:24:05.292 --> 01:24:06.501
You are too old.

01:24:06.667 --> 01:24:08.126
It's out of your range.

01:24:08.501 --> 01:24:10.167
You're not good enough.

01:24:10.751 --> 01:24:11.917
You see that door.

01:24:12.042 --> 01:24:14.042
Close it. And be on the
other side when you do.

01:24:14.167 --> 01:24:16.001
Konstantin Mikhailovich,
I apologise.

01:24:16.126 --> 01:24:17.584
- Go!
- Take no notice.

01:24:17.709 --> 01:24:19.834
I am not continuing
until you go.

01:24:23.667 --> 01:24:24.959
Go.

01:25:52.751 --> 01:25:55.917
That's not how you pack a suitcase.
Here, let me do it.

01:25:56.042 --> 01:26:00.251
I'll pack my own suitcase!
You're stifling me!

01:26:00.376 --> 01:26:03.709
You're killing me!
The two of you!

01:26:09.834 --> 01:26:12.167
I was trying to help.

01:26:20.626 --> 01:26:21.917
I'm home.

01:26:27.251 --> 01:26:28.501
I don't know what's
been happening,

01:26:28.667 --> 01:26:29.959
but there's an atmosphere.

01:26:30.084 --> 01:26:32.792
Leave it, sweet-pea.
It doesn't matter.

01:26:41.334 --> 01:26:43.709
You're going to go to
Paris Rudi...

01:26:44.376 --> 01:26:46.292
and then you'll
go to London...

01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:51.001
and you're going to
be transformed.

01:26:54.959 --> 01:26:57.042
You have a special talent

01:26:57.626 --> 01:27:01.292
but that's going to isolate you.

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:06.459
So you have to
fight that isolation.

01:27:13.751 --> 01:27:16.876
There's no such thing as a human being
who's not dependent on anyone.

01:27:23.834 --> 01:27:25.292
I'm going out.

01:27:44.876 --> 01:27:47.042
I am honoured to present
the Nijinsky Prize...

01:27:47.167 --> 01:27:51.209
to the brilliant young Soviet dancer,
Rudolf Nureyev.

01:30:47.376 --> 01:30:49.834
No, no, not tonight. You're not going out.

01:30:51.251 --> 01:30:52.667
Why not? I don't understand.

01:30:53.209 --> 01:30:54.751
Tonight you stay with the group.

01:30:55.167 --> 01:30:57.334
What's going on?
This is ridiculous - it's my birthday!

01:31:03.667 --> 01:31:05.334
Let them have some fun!

01:31:07.459 --> 01:31:10.167
Now come on. This isn't funny.

01:31:10.917 --> 01:31:12.959
Vitaly Dimitrivich,
it's our last night in Paris.

01:31:13.751 --> 01:31:14.917
No, you've had your fun.

01:31:15.042 --> 01:31:19.084
What are you going to do?
Not good publicity, is it?

01:31:20.167 --> 01:31:23.417
Come on, be reasonable,
it's our last night here.

01:31:26.084 --> 01:31:27.876
Please...

01:31:34.417 --> 01:31:36.751
No later than two.
And you're in charge of him.

01:33:05.001 --> 01:33:06.126
All right, Rudi,
let's go.

01:33:06.667 --> 01:33:08.376
We're already late.
Time to go.

01:33:08.501 --> 01:33:10.042
The bus doesn't leave
till the morning.

01:33:10.167 --> 01:33:11.667
I promised to Strizhevsky.

01:33:12.251 --> 01:33:14.584
Break your promise.

01:33:15.292 --> 01:33:17.126
It's up to you.

01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:13.876
Rudi, before you go I just need a word.

01:35:14.042 --> 01:35:14.876
What is it?

01:35:15.001 --> 01:35:17.501
Come over here, I'll tell you.

01:35:19.626 --> 01:35:23.209
We just got a telegram this morning.

01:35:24.001 --> 01:35:29.751
Khrushchev wants you to fly back to Moscow
for a special gala.

01:35:30.126 --> 01:35:31.459
A gala?

01:35:32.292 --> 01:35:33.667
Yes, it's a great honour

01:35:33.792 --> 01:35:36.292
to perform for the First Secretary.

01:35:36.584 --> 01:35:38.626
But I'm going to London.

01:35:38.751 --> 01:35:40.334
Later, later.

01:35:41.167 --> 01:35:43.292
The new plan is: you'll join the company
later in London.

01:35:43.417 --> 01:35:45.042
- No. I'm going right now.
- No.

01:35:45.626 --> 01:35:47.167
You are going to Moscow first.

01:35:47.292 --> 01:35:48.126
I'm not going to Moscow.

01:35:49.042 --> 01:35:51.709
Whatever happens,
I'm not going to Moscow.

01:35:51.834 --> 01:35:55.251
You stay here now. Wait a little with
Strizhevsky.

01:35:55.876 --> 01:35:57.792
There's a flight to Moscow in two hours.

01:35:58.209 --> 01:35:59.459
Are you coming?

01:35:59.709 --> 01:36:01.501
No. I'm going to London.

01:36:01.626 --> 01:36:04.167
Then who is going with me?
Which other dancer?

01:36:04.292 --> 01:36:06.792
Who's dancing with me?

01:36:07.667 --> 01:36:09.126
You are going to Moscow alone.

01:36:10.084 --> 01:36:13.042
No I'm not going. I'd rather kill myself.

01:36:14.292 --> 01:36:15.459
Is there some kind of problem?

01:36:20.417 --> 01:36:21.917
Rudi, let's discuss this.

01:36:23.126 --> 01:36:25.917
I'm going to scream at the top
of my voice.

01:36:42.501 --> 01:36:44.709
Konstantin, please -
make your way to the gate.

01:37:08.209 --> 01:37:10.917
My mother is ill?!

01:37:11.042 --> 01:37:12.626
What is this?
You keep changing the story.

01:37:12.751 --> 01:37:15.584
First I'm dancing for Khrushchev then
my mother is ill?

01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:21.334
No! No! You played this trick before
on other dancers!

01:37:25.459 --> 01:37:29.126
They're trying to send me to Moscow,
they're trying to send me to prison.

01:37:29.584 --> 01:37:31.084
Rudi, are you sure?

01:37:31.209 --> 01:37:33.417
- Of course I'm sure. I'm a dead man.
- Rudi, believe me,

01:37:33.501 --> 01:37:35.292
- it's better to do what they ask.
- No!

01:37:35.417 --> 01:37:36.876
Rudi, you'll be OK,
we'll see you in London.

01:37:37.001 --> 01:37:38.501
You're never going to see me again!

01:37:38.667 --> 01:37:40.876
Rudi, I'm sure it's a misunderstanding.
It's a mistake.

01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:43.042
It's not a mistake.
They won't let me dance!

01:37:43.167 --> 01:37:45.501
Come on, go to the gate.

01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:57.459
Rudi, I promise you, I'll tell everyone
so they know what's happening.

01:37:57.584 --> 01:37:59.126
It will be all right.

01:38:01.251 --> 01:38:03.501
Go to the gate immediately.

01:38:54.459 --> 01:38:56.459
I've seen what's happening.
Can I help?

01:38:57.584 --> 01:38:59.792
Look, I have to stay here -
he's safe as long as I'm here.

01:38:59.917 --> 01:39:01.334
I'll give you a telephone number...

01:39:02.042 --> 01:39:03.626
Be discreet...

01:39:04.126 --> 01:39:05.751
Tell her to come here
as quickly as possible.

01:39:22.459 --> 01:39:24.751
I'm sorry, I can't get through.

01:39:25.709 --> 01:39:27.876
And now I'm too late - I have to leave.

01:39:29.001 --> 01:39:31.001
- You can't go now!
- I'm sorry.

01:39:43.792 --> 01:39:44.834
Jean-Pierre

01:39:44.959 --> 01:39:46.834
Ring this number,
tell her to come at once.

01:39:46.959 --> 01:39:47.876
OK, who is it?

01:39:48.001 --> 01:39:51.042
Someone who can help.

01:40:07.709 --> 01:40:12.001
Rudi, take a seat. We have some time.
Don't worry.

01:41:07.167 --> 01:41:09.126
Clara, I can't leave him here.

01:41:28.751 --> 01:41:32.167
Has nobody told you?
You have a situation down there.

01:41:32.751 --> 01:41:33.584
Tell me.

01:41:34.251 --> 01:41:36.334
There's a Russian dancer down there.
He wants to defect.

01:41:38.167 --> 01:41:39.126
Who is he?

01:41:39.251 --> 01:41:41.501
Rudolf Nureyev.
You've heard of him?

01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:49.251
Are you sure he's a dancer?
If he's a scientist, this could get difficult.

01:41:49.376 --> 01:41:50.292
He's not a scientist.

01:41:51.001 --> 01:41:51.834
How do you know?

01:41:51.959 --> 01:41:54.376
I saw him dancing last night.
He didn't dance like a scientist.

01:41:55.167 --> 01:41:57.376
- Who are you?
- Clara Saint.

01:41:57.501 --> 01:41:59.501
I'm a personal friend of AndrÃ© Malraux.

01:42:01.292 --> 01:42:02.334
Malraux?

01:42:02.834 --> 01:42:03.667
Yes.

01:42:05.667 --> 01:42:07.417
So what do I do?

01:42:08.459 --> 01:42:09.792
Will you come down?

01:42:10.626 --> 01:42:11.709
Are there any Russian Agents down there?

01:42:11.834 --> 01:42:13.251
Yes, he's surrounded.

01:42:14.001 --> 01:42:15.709
In that case, he's going to have to
surprise them.

01:42:16.084 --> 01:42:20.667
In this situation, there are laws. We must
obey them. There's a protocol.

01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:23.292
We are not allowed to approach him.

01:42:23.417 --> 01:42:25.126
He has to approach us.

01:42:44.084 --> 01:42:47.042
Excuse me - I'm from "Le Figaro."
Do you know what is happening?

01:42:47.167 --> 01:42:49.251
No. I don't know.

01:45:19.501 --> 01:45:20.709
That's enough.

01:45:20.834 --> 01:45:22.501
We are in France here.

01:45:27.626 --> 01:45:29.126
Step back!

01:45:52.917 --> 01:45:54.751
Do you realise what you've done?

01:45:55.626 --> 01:45:56.959
The Russians will kill him.

01:46:05.834 --> 01:46:06.917
One moment.

01:47:15.251 --> 01:47:17.501
Very well. I made a mistake.

01:47:18.209 --> 01:47:20.417
I've re-booked you.

01:47:20.876 --> 01:47:23.584
You just want to dance,
that's what you say.

01:47:25.084 --> 01:47:27.167
You're on the next flight to London.

01:47:29.084 --> 01:47:30.251
No.

01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:35.001
Rudi, you'll join the company in London.

01:47:36.251 --> 01:47:37.584
No.

01:47:40.417 --> 01:47:44.376
I think I've got to know you
in the last few weeks.

01:47:46.501 --> 01:47:48.459
I understand you.

01:47:48.584 --> 01:47:49.459
A little bit.

01:47:51.334 --> 01:47:53.667
And I like you.

01:47:54.042 --> 01:47:57.417
I know where you've come from -
how hard you've struggled.

01:48:03.751 --> 01:48:06.917
I know how much you love your mother.
Your family.

01:48:13.667 --> 01:48:16.751
Can you look your mother in the eyes...

01:48:18.209 --> 01:48:19.959
and tell her...

01:48:22.126 --> 01:48:25.042
"I betrayed you."

01:48:26.584 --> 01:48:30.001
"I betrayed the Soviet Union?"

01:48:38.001 --> 01:48:41.042
Your family will become pariahs.

01:48:41.167 --> 01:48:43.292
You won't just destroy your own life.

01:48:43.417 --> 01:48:44.626
I know that.

01:48:44.917 --> 01:48:48.709
Leave the Soviet Union now and you
will spend your whole life in disgrace.

01:48:48.834 --> 01:48:53.001
You'll never get back.
Never see your home again.

01:48:53.959 --> 01:48:55.626
Understand?

01:48:56.167 --> 01:48:57.709
Never.

01:48:58.584 --> 01:49:00.292
Never return home.

01:49:01.209 --> 01:49:05.626
An hour ago, you made a mistake.
In panic.

01:49:06.376 --> 01:49:09.376
I'm offering you the
chance to put it right.

01:49:24.501 --> 01:49:26.501
Think about it.

01:50:14.501 --> 01:50:16.834
If he decides to stay,
I'll need you.

01:50:16.959 --> 01:50:19.917
There's a lot of press down there -
you'll have to deal with them.

01:50:20.042 --> 01:50:21.751
- Does he have somewhere to live?
- I can find somewhere.

01:50:21.876 --> 01:50:23.751
I know people who will take him.

01:50:23.876 --> 01:50:26.917
You'll need more than one place -
move him every 48 hrs.

01:50:42.251 --> 01:50:44.751
Look how dirty you are.

01:50:46.417 --> 01:50:48.417
You have to wash your hands.

01:50:49.292 --> 01:50:51.209
And paste down your hair.

01:50:51.501 --> 01:50:55.209
How you look is very important.

01:50:56.501 --> 01:50:58.292
Go and change over there.

01:51:03.251 --> 01:51:04.501
Now please,

01:51:04.667 --> 01:51:08.084
you have to leave.

01:51:08.584 --> 01:51:11.709
He has to do this alone.

01:53:44.501 --> 01:53:46.917
Is this Romeo and Juliet?
Is he staying for love?

01:53:47.251 --> 01:53:48.459
What? Were you dropped on your head?

01:53:50.376 --> 01:53:52.084
Where is he now?
Is he still in the building?

01:54:21.792 --> 01:54:24.792
He'll be tried for treason in his absence.

01:54:29.417 --> 01:54:31.501
I'm very ashamed.

01:54:35.417 --> 01:54:37.626
I'm ashamed of Nureyev.

01:54:39.959 --> 01:54:42.792
I'm ashamed of myself.

01:55:06.792 --> 01:55:08.042
All right?

01:55:12.792 --> 01:55:14.084
His suitcase came back.

01:55:20.001 --> 01:55:21.459
I'll get supper.

01:55:45.667 --> 01:55:47.167
Hello, darling.

01:55:48.292 --> 01:55:49.917
You're all over the papers.

01:55:51.834 --> 01:55:53.001
You're famous.

01:55:56.376 --> 01:55:57.626
Any regrets?

01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:01.751
Has he called you?

01:56:04.667 --> 01:56:05.501
Is he going to call you?

01:56:06.917 --> 01:56:08.209
Eventually.

01:56:09.251 --> 01:56:11.251
He hasn't yet? Why not?

01:56:13.501 --> 01:56:15.292
Because that's not who he is.
