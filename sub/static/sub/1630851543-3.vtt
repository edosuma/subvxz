a 16-year-old magician.

When I was 11 years old,

01:35.962 --> 01:37.864
I spent my first night away
from home

01:37.897 --> 01:39.699
at magic camp.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.902
I absolutely loved it.
Over the last two years,

01:42.936 --> 01:45.872
social media has been my
biggest source of creativity.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.907
It's helped me grow so much
as a magician

01:47.941 --> 01:49.409
because I like
to challenge myself

01:49.442 --> 01:50.877
to develop new tricks
constantly.

01:51.544 --> 01:53.446
I'm interested
in studying engineering.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.381

how things work

01:55.415 --> 01:57.183

01:57.217 --> 01:59.886

other people's magic,

my first original trick.

mentoring, and teaching magic.

my name as a magician,

02:41.528 --> 02:43.663

the first thing I learned

02:43.696 --> 02:46.866
was how to shuffle
a deck of cards.

02:46.900 --> 02:49.936
It was a nice start, but I
wanted to learn some magic.

02:49.969 --> 02:52.405

pick a card trick.

"stop" whenever?

this will be your card.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.086
- Okay.
- Please remember it.

03:08.221 --> 03:11.524
Now I can lose it back
into the deck,

03:11.558 --> 03:15.962
but simply finding it probably
won't impress you guys.

03:15.995 --> 03:20.600

in a really awesome way?

- Eight of hearts?

where I take out the card

03:54.801 --> 03:58.504

out of a real deck.

04:10.817 --> 04:13.052
You see,
when I first learned this,

04:13.086 --> 04:16.556
I couldn't do a card fan,

04:16.589 --> 04:22.595

a printed piece of paper.

on both sides.

You know, it's actually pretty
easy to make one of these.

04:40.213 --> 04:42.615
All you need is
a printed photo of a fan.

04:43.349 --> 04:45.385
You cut it out
and hold it to pretend

04:45.418 --> 04:47.320

a fan of cards.

you're a skilled magician.

this printed fan.

04:51.424 --> 04:55.194
But you gotta admit,
it looks pretty good.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.698
But if we really wanted
to finish the trick,

04:58.731 --> 05:04.570
you would have to be able
to take the card out,

The most important thing magic

10:00.366 --> 10:03.736
how to be a better person.
I was a nerd in school,

10:03.769 --> 10:05.972

would make me popular.

I'm so happy to be here.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.041
You can't imagine.
I'm very happy to be here.

11:15.074 --> 11:17.510
I want to be here
for a long time.

11:17.543 --> 11:19.045
And I love magic.

11:19.078 --> 11:21.814
And I'm very happy to show
you something here tonight.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.215
I want to use
my sleight of hand,

11:23.249 --> 11:25.251
and also, I'll use
a few objects.

11:25.284 --> 11:29.021
But also, I definitely need
the magic of your imagination.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.923
It's very important
for all of us.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.192
So--but I want to help you
to imagine things.

11:33.225 --> 11:36.595
So I'll use
a very strange object.

11:36.629 --> 11:43.569
This is a top of a purse
without a purse.

11:43.602 --> 11:46.372
So you can imagine any color,
any shape, any size you want.

11:46.405 --> 11:48.874
It can be a black square purse
or a rounded red purse,

11:48.908 --> 11:52.778
or even it can be like a green
purse, like, a larger one.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.880
So it's, like,
a freedom, right?

11:54.914 --> 11:56.582
So I want to show you,
for camera,

11:56.615 --> 11:59.785
but also show you for here.
Like, it's very simple.

11:59.819 --> 12:02.088
I use my hands,
and I use a purse.

12:02.755 --> 12:04.223
Open my purse, like, that way.

12:04.256 --> 12:07.226
So you can imagine
a coin from here.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.495
Just--it's very simple.

12:09.528 --> 12:11.831
And you feel like,
"Wow, it's so real." Isn't it?

12:11.864 --> 12:13.365
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.568
So I'm going to put
the coin in my pocket.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.003
But some people will say,
"Oh, it's in your palm.

12:18.037 --> 12:21.474
Oh, that's no good."
So you can see the coin.

12:21.507 --> 12:24.810
But if I put the coin
in my purse, to be honest,

12:24.844 --> 12:28.547
I can't vanish--make it vanish.
The coin exists here, right?

12:28.581 --> 12:31.150
So I just make you believe
that it's invisible

12:31.183 --> 12:32.351
because it's invisible purse.

12:32.384 --> 12:35.688
It's very soft and simple
and interesting.

12:35.721 --> 12:38.257
But it exists here.
Just right here. Like this way.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.025
It's very--
looks like, right?

12:40.059 --> 12:42.194
So I love this kind of magic

12:42.228 --> 12:43.696
because, you know,
at the beginning,

12:43.729 --> 12:45.598
we are trying to accept
what happened,

12:45.631 --> 12:47.533
but we are not sure.
Little by little,

12:47.566 --> 12:50.770
your brain starts to understand
what is the rule,

12:50.803 --> 12:53.205
and your eyes start
to lie to you.

12:53.239 --> 12:55.374
You kind of--generally,
you know what happened,

12:55.407 --> 12:57.576
but your eyes lie to you.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.578
So, watch, when it put
the coin in my purse,

12:59.612 --> 13:02.348
you feel like it's a--you know,
invisible purse.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.616
You feel like
I don't move so quick.

13:03.649 --> 13:06.152
Very slow. Invisible.

13:06.185 --> 13:08.187
Visible. Do you feel that?

13:08.220 --> 13:11.957
So you know, but you feel
like you don't know.

13:11.991 --> 13:14.560
If I want, I can do this
20 more minutes like this.

13:14.593 --> 13:16.629
You know, I can do forever,
forever.

13:16.662 --> 13:19.365
But, you know,
it's really hard because,

13:19.398 --> 13:21.233
you know, the imagination
is very fragile.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.903
So when I do this kind
of stuff, sometimes, you know,

13:23.936 --> 13:26.138
people cannot believe
what they see.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.306
So which means, like, you know,

13:27.339 --> 13:29.208
you want to feel
a little bit more reality.

13:29.241 --> 13:30.676
That's why, like,
I need your help.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.878
Sometimes people think
it's, like, a camera trick,

13:33.879 --> 13:35.314
because, like, you know,
you are seeing close,

13:35.347 --> 13:36.982
but Penn's
seeing from far away.

13:37.016 --> 13:38.584
People are watching
through the camera.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.886
Of course, people can see.
Sometimes you feel like

13:40.920 --> 13:43.522
it's a kind
of a camera trick, right?

13:43.556 --> 13:44.590
all: Oh!

13:44.623 --> 13:46.192
- So now you can use
your right hand,

13:46.225 --> 13:47.693
and could you take
this coin for me?

13:49.061 --> 13:50.830
Just pinch the coin.
Yeah, there we go.

13:50.863 --> 13:52.164
No, I'm not talking
about this one.

13:52.198 --> 13:53.332
Actually,
I'm talking about this.

13:53.365 --> 13:54.867
So you feel like
you're seeing this one.

13:54.900 --> 13:59.939
So--so now you can see
the coin and purse, everything.

13:59.972 --> 14:03.042
And, you know,
the whole magic is for you

14:03.075 --> 14:05.110
and for me and for everyone.

14:05.144 --> 14:07.780
But hopefully, we enjoyed
this magic together.

14:07.813 --> 14:09.682
So thank you so much.

14:09.715 --> 14:13.319
[cheers and applause]

14:14.920 --> 14:17.189
- Shoot Ogawa!

14:18.490 --> 14:20.492
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.194
- Nice to meet you.
It's a pleasure.

14:22.228 --> 14:25.364
- So--Teller looked
totally amazed.

14:25.397 --> 14:27.166
You made him look like
a little kid again.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.403
- Yes, I hope so.
I tried to do my best.

14:31.437 --> 14:32.705
- Yeah.

14:32.738 --> 14:35.074
- It was a very
stressful situation, so...

14:35.107 --> 14:37.343
- Because it was Teller?
- Yeah.

14:37.376 --> 14:41.080
He--like--I--you know--I--yeah,
he is the best of the best,

14:41.113 --> 14:42.848
so, you know,
it's almost impossible

14:42.882 --> 14:45.217
to make them feel like,
"We have no idea."

14:45.251 --> 14:47.519
But also, for them,
it's almost impossible

14:47.553 --> 14:49.588
to tell every single detail.

14:49.622 --> 14:52.524
- So you've said
that you started in magic

14:52.558 --> 14:54.193
to make you popular.
Did it work?

14:55.427 --> 14:56.862
- Nah.
- What?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.832
- It didn't work.
- Give me some phone numbers.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.835
I'm going to call some people.

15:02.868 --> 15:04.670
You should be very popular.

15:04.703 --> 15:06.505
- I am not popular.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.341
I'm a nerd,
still a nerd, and still a geek.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.277
- Yeah, but that's what
makes you great.

15:11.310 --> 15:12.811
- Well, I don't know.

15:12.845 --> 15:15.948
People feel comfortable
if someone sees some weakness.

15:15.981 --> 15:17.783
And then magic is so powerful.

15:17.816 --> 15:20.219
I want to keep it balanced
with my personality.

15:20.252 --> 15:22.221
- Shoot, we loved
your sleight of hand.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.657
Let's see if Penn and Teller
will hand you a trophy.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.892
- Yeah.
- Ah, Shoot, Shoot, Shoot.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.061
I got so much good to say.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.796
I just don't know
where to start.

15:30.829 --> 15:33.999
You come out, and you explained
exactly what it is.

15:34.033 --> 15:36.835
You say, "It's a purse, a coin,
and sleight of hand,"

15:36.869 --> 15:38.971
and that's precisely
what it is,

15:39.004 --> 15:42.675
and the best sleight of hand of
anybody in the world right now.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.377
- Wow.
- It is just breathtaking.

15:45.411 --> 15:47.513
And I think everybody
knows that.

15:47.546 --> 15:50.182
But I want to talk
about something that--

15:50.215 --> 15:52.518
that maybe not
everybody thinks about.

15:52.551 --> 15:56.922
And that is, I think you're one
of the best talkers in magic.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.391
Your patter is just gorgeous.

15:59.425 --> 16:03.662
Everybody tries to talk
about illusion and the gift

16:03.696 --> 16:07.333
and how you're giving that,
where the imagination is,

16:07.366 --> 16:09.635
and everybody else
that says it,

16:09.668 --> 16:13.839
it comes out trite and obvious

16:13.872 --> 16:16.375
and always rubs me
the wrong way.

16:16.408 --> 16:20.346
And when you speak of it, it is
so much part of your heart

16:20.379 --> 16:23.048
and your soul
that it feels like poetry.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.984
And Teller came back
to his seat,

16:25.017 --> 16:26.385
with tears in his eyes,

16:26.418 --> 16:30.456
feeling like royalty
to be that close.

16:30.489 --> 16:32.391
The way you had us
in the palm of your hand,

16:32.424 --> 16:34.860
and we know sleight of hand.

16:34.893 --> 16:37.730
And yet you have no tells.

16:37.763 --> 16:40.065
You have nothing
that gives it away.

16:40.099 --> 16:42.368
I can say,
with Teller on top of you

16:42.401 --> 16:44.870
and me staring my nose
buried in the monitor,

16:44.903 --> 16:46.805
not a false move.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.075
Everything,
everything just perfect.

16:50.109 --> 16:52.177
And the guts to bring Teller

16:52.211 --> 16:53.512
up there
to be right on top of you.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.648
I think when people picture
sleight of hand,

16:56.682 --> 17:01.787
when people picture magic,
that's the platonic ideal

17:01.820 --> 17:03.789
of what a magic routine
should be.

17:03.822 --> 17:06.258
And people at home saw,

17:06.291 --> 17:09.862
absolutely,
without a doubt, real magic.

17:09.895 --> 17:12.664
And even though all of that,
I think, you know, Shoot,

17:12.698 --> 17:15.000
that we know
how those moves are done.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.770
We've just never seen them
done that well.

17:17.803 --> 17:18.971
I don't think you fooled us,

17:19.004 --> 17:21.707
but you killed us dead,
you know?

17:21.740 --> 17:23.208
- Aww!
- Thank you.

17:23.242 --> 17:24.977
- So do they know
how you did your tricks?

17:25.010 --> 17:26.211
- Yeah, they know
exactly what I did.

17:26.245 --> 17:28.614
- Aw!
- So good, Shoot.

17:28.647 --> 17:30.682
- Well, thank you so much
for coming here.

17:30.716 --> 17:31.850

Look where we found this one.

18:05.484 --> 18:08.353
- Before magic, I was lost.

18:08.387 --> 18:10.189
I was studying
to be an engineer,

18:10.222 --> 18:12.591
but engineering
didn't excite me.

18:12.624 --> 18:16.128
Then I found my passion
by accident.

18:16.161 --> 18:18.931
I was in Milan
with nothing to do.

18:18.964 --> 18:20.632
In a corner out of the way,

18:20.666 --> 18:23.102
I saw a magician
performing tricks.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.537
That seemed like something
to learn

18:25.571 --> 18:27.506
and something to become.

18:27.539 --> 18:30.542
Two years later,

18:30.576 --> 18:32.644
I've been on stage ever since.

18:32.678 --> 18:35.347
My girlfriend, Giulia,
is a performer too.

18:35.380 --> 18:38.350
I want our act to be seen

18:38.383 --> 18:41.153

so that Giulia and I

18:41.186 --> 18:44.156

This is why
I came on "Fool Us."

I'm doing it for her.

18:47.759 --> 18:50.863
My magic tonight uses
a machine I built myself,

18:50.896 --> 18:53.198
so I'm still an engineer.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.700
Will Penn and Teller
be amazed?

18:54.733 --> 18:56.135
I don't know.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.003
It's hard
to fool them with a device.

But if I do fool them

You know, all these box tricks

23:21.199 --> 23:25.203

really take them seriously.

23:26.004 --> 23:29.241
You know, they always just say,
"We're pushing this box out."

23:29.274 --> 23:30.876

and you looked great doing it.

absolutely beautiful.

23:43.388 --> 23:44.489

of history,

23:44.523 --> 23:46.324
I'm sure you know this,

23:46.358 --> 23:50.762
but all of these
moving bodies around tricks

23:50.796 --> 23:52.164
that are so wonderful

23:52.197 --> 23:54.266
kind of all go back
to Robert Harbin

23:54.299 --> 23:56.668
and the Zig Zag Girl.

23:56.701 --> 23:59.171
They all go back
to that basic principle

23:59.204 --> 24:01.206
that he pretty much worked on
his whole life,

24:01.239 --> 24:05.477
which is the principle that
we think you're using here.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.613
And you also have a little bit
of a disadvantage

24:08.647 --> 24:12.317
because this essential trick
is being used

24:12.350 --> 24:14.953
in a show that we wrote
that's now in England

24:14.986 --> 24:16.721
called "Magic Goes Wrong."

24:16.755 --> 24:19.524
We use this as one
of the opening illusions,

24:19.558 --> 24:22.461
though I'll tell you,
we use it more like Harbin did

24:22.494 --> 24:24.729
and less like a whole story

24:24.763 --> 24:26.865
and a healing,
the way you've done it,

24:26.898 --> 24:29.201
which makes it
so nice and so rich

24:29.234 --> 24:32.504

You did a great job with it,

you fooled us.

your granddad did the trick?

It was my grandfather, really,

- Yes, everybody hates them.
But the reason you hate them

35:46.744 --> 35:50.648
is they're so loud
and noisy and squeaky.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.083
- Squeaky.

35:52.116 --> 35:52.984
- It's like fingernails
on chalkboard.

was that in New York or Jersey?

five years of your first nine
