WEBVTT

00:03.431 --> 00:06.132
Oh, incoming,
three o'clock.

00:07.268 --> 00:09.102
Wow.
(chuckles)

00:09.104 --> 00:11.354
If I were available,
I'd be all over that.

00:11.356 --> 00:12.689
So being unavailable

00:12.691 --> 00:14.074
is the only thing
that's stopping you?

00:14.076 --> 00:18.745
Well, that and her obvious,
but unvoiced contempt for me.

00:19.864 --> 00:21.614
Why don't you
make a move?

00:21.616 --> 00:22.832
Aw, what's the point?

00:22.834 --> 00:24.668
Let's say I start talking
to her, and we hit it off.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.619
And by "hit it
off," you mean

00:26.621 --> 00:28.038
(goofy voice):
hit it off.

00:29.323 --> 00:32.125
Hmm, more unvoiced
contempt. Hmm.

00:32.127 --> 00:33.927
I can voice it if you'd like.

00:33.929 --> 00:35.879
No thanks.

00:35.881 --> 00:38.131
What do you think is gonna
happen as soon as she finds out

00:38.133 --> 00:39.516
how much money I have
in the bank?

00:39.518 --> 00:42.519
She's gonna want you
to make a deposit.

00:42.521 --> 00:45.555
And there's the problem.

00:45.557 --> 00:47.307
I-I see no problem.

00:47.309 --> 00:50.143
'Kay. It's not <i>me</i>
that she'd be interested in.

00:50.145 --> 00:52.812
It's what I can do for her.
It's the lifestyle.

00:52.814 --> 00:54.447
So what? You
still got laid.

00:54.449 --> 00:55.899
Trust me, it gets old.

00:55.901 --> 00:57.817
It's like having
a magic golf club:

00:57.819 --> 01:00.653
every time you take a shot,
the ball just goes in the hole.

01:00.655 --> 01:03.022
Oh, yeah!
Ker-plunk!

01:03.024 --> 01:06.626
Okay, apparently, you
need a demonstration.

01:06.628 --> 01:08.244
And no more alcohol.

01:09.547 --> 01:11.081
Hi.

01:11.916 --> 01:13.550
I'm Walden Schmidt.

01:13.552 --> 01:15.001
Hello.

01:15.003 --> 01:18.037
That's "Schmidt,"
S-C-H-M-I-D-T.

01:18.039 --> 01:20.724
Uh, okay. It's nice
to meet you, Walden.

01:20.726 --> 01:24.594
I'm Susan. S-U-S-A-N.

01:24.596 --> 01:26.879
Can I buy you
a drink, Susan?

01:26.881 --> 01:30.100
No, thanks. I'm waiting
for some friends.

01:30.102 --> 01:31.384
No problem.
Excuse me.

01:31.386 --> 01:33.103
Hmm. There goes
your theory.

01:33.105 --> 01:34.020
You struck out!

01:34.022 --> 01:35.488
<i>Au contraire,</i>
<i>mon frère.</i>

01:35.490 --> 01:37.741
Right now, she's heading
into the bathroom.

01:37.743 --> 01:40.193
What do you think
she's doing in there?

01:40.195 --> 01:41.411
Uh, I'm guessing tinkle.

01:41.413 --> 01:44.063
Girls poop at home.

01:44.065 --> 01:45.832
No. She's wondering,

01:45.834 --> 01:48.034
"Why did he spell his last name?

01:48.036 --> 01:49.586
Maybe I should know who he is."

01:49.588 --> 01:52.405
So, now, she's taking out
her phone and Googling me.

01:52.407 --> 01:53.573
Oh, I tried that once,

01:53.575 --> 01:55.759
and I dropped my phone
in the toilet.

01:55.761 --> 01:58.411
Fortunately, it was right
after a courtesy flush.

01:58.413 --> 02:01.631
The first hit on my name
is the Forbes 500 Web site,

02:01.633 --> 02:04.017
at which point in time
she finds out

02:04.019 --> 02:05.751
exactly how much money I make,

02:05.753 --> 02:07.637
she forgets to go
to the bathroom,

02:07.639 --> 02:10.473
along with everything
she learned in Sunday school,

02:10.475 --> 02:14.227
slaps on some lipstick
and comes back into the bar.

02:14.229 --> 02:15.895
Wow.

02:15.897 --> 02:18.898
She probably unbuttons
one button on her blouse...

02:18.900 --> 02:20.283
and...

02:20.285 --> 02:21.284
You know what?

02:21.286 --> 02:24.621
I changed my mind
about that drink.

02:24.623 --> 02:27.157
I still don't
see the problem.

02:28.626 --> 02:31.611

02:31.613 --> 02:33.697

== sync, corrected by <font color="#00FF00">elderman</font> ==

02:42.605 --> 02:43.873
Can't believe
you're coming home with me

02:43.874 --> 02:45.073
instead of that girl.

02:45.075 --> 02:46.375
Not that I'm
not flattered.

02:46.377 --> 02:48.877
And not that I'm not willing
to do things.

02:48.879 --> 02:51.196
Just because a woman
wants to have sex with me,

02:51.198 --> 02:53.535
doesn't mean I want
to have sex with her.

02:53.537 --> 02:55.404
Okay, I hear the words coming
out of your mouth,

02:55.457 --> 02:56.957
I just don't
understand them.

02:57.378 --> 02:59.044
It's like watching
HBO in Spanish.

02:59.046 --> 03:02.381
Well, look, call me crazy,
but I am determined to find

03:02.383 --> 03:06.635
someone who wants to be with me
for who I am, not what I have.

03:06.637 --> 03:09.688
<i>Hola, bienvenidos</i>
<i>a HBO en español.</i>

03:10.757 --> 03:11.907
Come on.

03:11.909 --> 03:13.809
I bet you have no doubt

03:13.811 --> 03:15.694
as to whether or not
Lyndsey loves you.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.928
I would guess that's true.

03:16.930 --> 03:18.280
You don't have to guess.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.449
You have no money,
no house, no future, no...

03:20.451 --> 03:23.101
Okay, okay!
Talking past the sale.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.937
But if you think my life
is so great, be my guest.

03:25.939 --> 03:27.272
Take it.
What?

03:27.274 --> 03:29.324
Pretend to be me. I can't
tell you how many times

03:29.326 --> 03:30.292
I've pretended to be you.

03:30.294 --> 03:31.577
And-And not
just you.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.446
Uh, I've also pretended
to be a thoracic surgeon

03:34.448 --> 03:37.466
uh... a movie producer,
a stockbroker,

03:37.468 --> 03:40.002
and on one occasion,
a hand model.

03:40.004 --> 03:41.253
A hand model?

03:41.255 --> 03:43.055
Blind girl. Long story,
didn't end well.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.984
My point is, you can be
whoever you want to be.

03:47.009 --> 03:47.811
Hmm.

03:47.812 --> 03:49.261
Never thought about it
like that.

03:49.263 --> 03:52.397
Course not. Why would Superman
want to be Clark Kent?

03:53.216 --> 03:55.967
Okay. Know what?
I'm gonna do this.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.604
First thing I need
to do is create

03:58.606 --> 04:01.073
an online presence
for my fictional self.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.808
Mm. That's good.
I usually just throw ketchup

04:02.810 --> 04:05.527
on some scrubs
and say I came from surgery.

04:05.529 --> 04:09.031
Okay. Let's start by creating
a Facebook page.

04:09.033 --> 04:12.785
Uh, all right, if I was
a struggling, broke-ass guy,

04:12.787 --> 04:14.119
what would my name be?

04:14.121 --> 04:16.755
Oh, and keep in mind,
Alan Harper's already taken.

04:17.589 --> 04:20.291
Ooh! H-How about
Derek Slade?

04:20.293 --> 04:22.211
Uh, that's a
little gay.

04:22.213 --> 04:24.980
Um... Preston Burbank?

04:24.982 --> 04:27.833
That's just gay from
a different decade.

04:27.835 --> 04:29.802
Um... Joey Proccosini.

04:29.804 --> 04:31.804
Sounds like the
guy that made

04:31.806 --> 04:34.540
Preston Burbank
his prison bitch.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.741
Oh, uh-uh,

04:35.743 --> 04:37.276
how about your porn name?

04:37.278 --> 04:38.726
My porn name?

04:38.751 --> 04:39.479
You know, when you
want to know

04:39.480 --> 04:41.363
what your name would be
as a porn star,

04:41.365 --> 04:43.232
you use the name
of your first pet,

04:43.234 --> 04:44.733
and the street you grew up on.

04:44.735 --> 04:48.620
Unfortunately, I would be
Rusty Knob.

04:48.622 --> 04:51.557
Mine would be
Snowball Honeysuckle.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.858
That would be a great porn name

04:52.860 --> 04:55.828
if Disney Channel started
making adult movies.

04:55.830 --> 04:58.380
No. It needs
to be simple,

04:58.382 --> 05:00.082
like something
easy to believe.

05:00.084 --> 05:01.550
John Doe.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.801
No, it's too simple.

05:02.803 --> 05:03.869
Bob Doe.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.304
No.

05:05.306 --> 05:08.307
It's got to be, like,
right down the middle.

05:08.309 --> 05:10.592
You know,
like... Sam.

05:10.594 --> 05:13.362
Doe.

05:13.364 --> 05:16.315
Wilson.
Sam Wilson.

05:16.317 --> 05:19.067
Really? There's got to be, like,
a million Sam Wilsons.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.553
No, <i>exactly.</i> I-I can
get lost in a crowd.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.889
Somebody Googles me, they'll
get a butt-load of responses.

05:23.891 --> 05:28.076
Same thing happens
if you Google "Rusty Knob."

05:28.078 --> 05:30.078
Just FYI: do not
hit "Images."

05:30.080 --> 05:33.115
You won't sleep
for a week.

05:33.117 --> 05:36.401
Okay, Sam Wilson,
let's create your life.

05:36.403 --> 05:37.452
Male.

05:37.454 --> 05:39.588
Straight.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.940
Single.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.126
1/8 Apache Indian.

05:45.244 --> 05:48.079
Mix it up a little.

05:51.534 --> 05:53.669
How have I never
heard of this place?

05:53.671 --> 05:56.405
I mean, where else can you buy
pants, shoes, lettuce,

05:56.407 --> 05:58.206
and a garden weasel
under one roof?

05:58.208 --> 05:59.474
It gets better.

05:59.476 --> 06:01.977
On your way out,
you can get a flu shot

06:01.979 --> 06:04.262
and a set of tires
at the same price.

06:04.264 --> 06:05.597
This is...
all right,

06:05.599 --> 06:08.617
what would a down-on-his-luck
Sam Wilson wear?

06:08.619 --> 06:11.904
Oh! Maybe something fringed
to reflect his Indian heritage.

06:13.406 --> 06:15.774
He's not joining
the Village People.

06:15.776 --> 06:18.160
Wait, check this out!

06:18.162 --> 06:20.278
A dozen socks for $2.49.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.632
That's 20 cents a pair.
That's ten cents a sock!

06:23.634 --> 06:25.384
I'm so getting these.

06:25.386 --> 06:27.285
But you don't wear socks.

06:27.287 --> 06:29.788
Well, at these prices
I can't afford not to.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.390
All right, looks like
you're getting

06:31.392 --> 06:33.926
the hang of this place.
So, if you'll excuse me,

06:33.928 --> 06:36.411
I have a dentist appointment
on aisle 3.

06:36.413 --> 06:39.648
Don't forget to floss
on aisle 2.

06:40.783 --> 06:44.419
A leather jacket for $49.99?

06:44.421 --> 06:46.138
Come to Papa.

06:49.308 --> 06:50.659
Whoa!

06:50.661 --> 06:51.977
Sorry.

06:51.979 --> 06:53.578
Yeah, hang on.
Let me just...

06:53.580 --> 06:55.897
The jacket's on a leash.

06:55.899 --> 06:57.649
I'll just unlock
the security cable here.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.368
Okay, that's better.

06:59.370 --> 07:02.254
That looks really
good on you.

07:02.256 --> 07:04.339
I bet you've said that before.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.874
About 80 times a day, but...
(laughs)

07:05.876 --> 07:07.759
this is the first time
I've meant it.

07:07.761 --> 07:09.211
Yeah, it's nice, but I...

07:09.213 --> 07:12.180
I probably shouldn't. I mean,
for the price of this jacket,

07:12.182 --> 07:14.099
I can buy 240 pairs of socks.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.852
And your Christmas shopping is done.
(chuckles)

07:16.854 --> 07:19.638
Act surprised when you open them.
(laughs)

07:19.640 --> 07:22.007
Yeah, actually, I need to buy
a little bit of everything.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.809
Okay, I can help you out
with that.

07:23.811 --> 07:26.395
I appreciate it... Kate.

07:26.397 --> 07:28.847
Not a problem.

07:28.849 --> 07:31.616
Sam... Sam Wilson.

07:31.618 --> 07:32.901
All right, Sam Wilson.

07:32.903 --> 07:35.537
Um, how about we
start with some...

07:35.539 --> 07:37.072
corduroy pants?

07:37.074 --> 07:39.858
Eh, I'm not a big fan
of corduroy.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.710
They're on sale,
two for $19.99.

07:41.712 --> 07:43.245
People change.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.835
JAKE: Anyway, after it got
ripped off on the barbed wire,

07:49.837 --> 07:52.704
we started calling him
"One Nut Johnson."

07:52.706 --> 07:55.223
Uh... that's terrible.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.808
Well, it could have been worse.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.310
An inch to the right,

07:58.312 --> 08:01.213
and he would have been
"No Johnson Johnson."

08:01.215 --> 08:04.182
Um, uh, you know what?
Why don't we change the subject?

08:04.184 --> 08:06.651
So, um, how are things
with your girlfriend?

08:06.653 --> 08:07.953
Pretty good.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.354
We're finally gonna get
some time alone this weekend.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.690
Her kids are gonna stay
with their dads.

08:11.692 --> 08:14.242
"Dads"? Plural?

08:14.244 --> 08:18.080
Yeah, well, before me,
she picked some real losers.

08:18.082 --> 08:20.198
Sure, sure. Um, so...

08:20.200 --> 08:23.585
...so what's it like,
dating someone with kids?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.037
It's tough.
They're pretty protective.

08:25.039 --> 08:27.939
I mean, I'm the guy
dating their mom.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.240
Makes sense.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.109
But her oldest son's
pretty cool.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.744
He buys me beer.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.881
How old is this woman?

08:35.883 --> 08:38.216
Back off, Dad. She's taken.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.769
No, no, I wasn't... I'm...

08:40.770 --> 08:43.270
You know what?
I'll talk to you later.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.991
Okay. Bye, Dad.
Bye.

08:45.993 --> 08:49.895
Yeah... she picked
a real winner this time.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.697
WALDEN:
Check it out.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.539
Whoa!

09:00.541 --> 09:02.874
You look like me
when I Photoshop my head

09:02.876 --> 09:04.910
on your body--
I've never done that.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.279
Head to toe, including
undergarments: $32.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.081
(whistles)

09:09.083 --> 09:11.783
Plus the haircut: $232.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.885
Nice.
Oh!

09:13.887 --> 09:15.554
Check this out.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.288
(Velcro tearing)

09:17.290 --> 09:19.224
Velcro. Very classy.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.392
It's got a change pouch.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.594
Ooh, you got the deluxe model.

09:22.596 --> 09:24.146
I still can't believe we both
went to the superstore,

09:24.148 --> 09:25.347
you got a hot date

09:25.349 --> 09:26.848
and I got a root canal
on the wrong tooth.

09:26.850 --> 09:31.269
I didn't get a date.
Sam Wilson got a date.

09:31.271 --> 09:34.238
You know what?
Switch watches with me.

09:34.263 --> 09:34.857
Why?

09:34.858 --> 09:37.142
'Cause Sam Wilson doesn't
have a $50,000 watch.

09:37.144 --> 09:39.327
Ah, course.
Here you go.

09:40.163 --> 09:41.329
Casio?

09:41.331 --> 09:43.698
I had this watch
in seventh grade!

09:43.700 --> 09:45.867
So did I.

09:45.869 --> 09:47.035
Okay...

09:47.037 --> 09:49.538
Oh, you know what?
We should also switch cars.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.924
Yes! Yes. Oh, and you know
what else we should do?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.343
Uh, you should deposit all
your money in my bank account.

09:56.429 --> 09:59.264
Just trying to help
you out, buddy. (laughs)

09:59.266 --> 10:00.549
Thank you.

10:00.551 --> 10:01.933
Oh, where you taking her?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.886
This, uh, Italian place
in Santa Monica. DiFilipo's.

10:04.888 --> 10:07.272
Oh, you are in luck.
I have a coupon.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.440

10:08.442 --> 10:10.942

get one free.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.563
Sweet. Thanks.
(Velcro tears)

10:14.565 --> 10:16.347
And remember, uh, poor guys
don't valet park

10:16.349 --> 10:17.699
unless they're wearing
a red vest.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.733
Got it.

10:21.571 --> 10:22.787
Wow.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.906
$50,000.

10:24.908 --> 10:27.025
What is wrong with me

10:27.027 --> 10:30.162
that I want to masturbate
with this on?

10:36.586 --> 10:38.420
Nothing.

10:43.626 --> 10:47.229
For a man on a budget,
this is a little pricey.

10:47.231 --> 10:50.348
Oh, don't worry.
I have a coupon.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.984
Sexy.

10:54.604 --> 10:58.490
So, Sam, tell me about yourself.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.158
(sighs)

11:00.160 --> 11:01.893
There's not much to tell.

11:01.895 --> 11:04.529
Uh, I was born in Iowa.

11:04.531 --> 11:07.365
At age seven, I was taken
away from my parents

11:07.367 --> 11:09.601
and trained to be a
government assassin.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.620
Intriguing.

11:11.622 --> 11:12.904
Oh, it gets better.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.506
It wasn't our government.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.326
And I only found out later,
they weren't my parents.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.427
(laughs)

11:19.429 --> 11:21.263
Which made killing them
that much easier.

11:22.248 --> 11:23.281
Tell me about you.

11:23.283 --> 11:26.184
Well, I had
a fairly typical childhood

11:26.186 --> 11:28.637
in Riverside, California

11:28.639 --> 11:32.140
until my parents were killed
by an assassin.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.694
I've spent the rest of my life
tracking him down,

11:35.696 --> 11:38.780
and here we are.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.115
Gulp.
Bang.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.267
(laughs)

11:42.269 --> 11:44.269
Well, the Riverside part's true,

11:44.271 --> 11:47.289
and then I spent two years
in New York studying fashion.

11:47.291 --> 11:48.657
Ah.
Then I came out here

11:48.659 --> 11:50.208
to design clothes
for the movies.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.042
And how did that go?

11:51.044 --> 11:52.043
I designed this dress

11:52.045 --> 11:53.828
and wore it to the movies.

11:53.830 --> 11:56.715
So the dream is still alive.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.550
Indeed it is.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.453
I got to tell you,
it's refreshing,

12:02.455 --> 12:04.723
talking to someone like you
for a change.

12:04.725 --> 12:06.258
Someone like me?

12:06.260 --> 12:09.177
Yeah, someone who doesn't
take himself too seriously

12:09.179 --> 12:11.179
and who's not constantly
trying to impress me

12:11.181 --> 12:12.764
with how much stuff he's got.

12:12.766 --> 12:15.066
What, so, wait, my coupon
didn't impress you?

12:15.068 --> 12:16.818
(laughs)

12:16.820 --> 12:19.604
Well, I don't
have much stuff.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.239
What you see is
what you get.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.474
And so far
I like what I see.

12:23.476 --> 12:24.843
I like what I see.

12:24.845 --> 12:25.910
(laughs)

12:29.582 --> 12:32.117
Such a shame I'm gonna
have to kill you.

12:32.119 --> 12:35.036
Too late. I already
poisoned your wine.

Yeah, sure, now.

a decent car?

13:41.088 --> 13:43.122
Kate, this is
my friend Alan.

13:43.124 --> 13:44.924
Thanks so much
for picking us up.

13:44.926 --> 13:46.626
Yeah, this clown rents
a room from me,

13:46.628 --> 13:48.294
suddenly I'm running
a taxi service.

13:49.430 --> 13:52.432
Yeah, I'm sorry.
My car is a piece of crap.

13:52.434 --> 13:54.601
Of course, I don't do
myself any favors

13:54.603 --> 13:57.804

Thank you.
Thank you.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.979
Uh, so Sam tells me
you have a beach house.

14:06.981 --> 14:08.865
I do. I do.
It's gorgeous.

14:08.867 --> 14:10.283
Uh,
it very expensive,

14:10.285 --> 14:12.335
but I bought it at the
bottom of the market

14:12.337 --> 14:15.371
and then I sold it and bought it
again at the top of the market

14:15.373 --> 14:17.791
simply because I can.

14:18.926 --> 14:21.427
Well, I'm sure at some point
you'll sell it again

14:21.429 --> 14:22.796
and we'll go
our separate ways.

14:22.798 --> 14:24.931
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm gonna die in that house.

14:24.933 --> 14:29.352
Oh, and, uh, that reminds me,
uh, your rent is late again.

14:29.354 --> 14:31.971
Right, I'll have it
for you tomorrow.

14:31.973 --> 14:33.339
Today would be better.

14:33.341 --> 14:35.525
Fine, today.

14:35.527 --> 14:36.893
He's a good kid.

14:36.895 --> 14:39.279
Give you the shirt
off his back.

14:39.281 --> 14:41.564
It's a crappy shirt,
but he'll give it to you.

14:41.566 --> 14:43.449
Oh, oh,

14:43.451 --> 14:44.400
would you look at the time?

14:44.402 --> 14:46.319
(chuckles)
It is almost 10:00.

14:46.321 --> 14:47.370
I-I can tell
'cause the, uh,

14:47.372 --> 14:48.955

the big diamond.

14:50.041 --> 14:51.357
Yeah, it's nice.

14:51.359 --> 14:53.159
Damn right.

14:55.546 --> 14:59.666
So, Kate, Sam tells me
you're poor like him.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.470
I had a really
nice time tonight.

15:04.472 --> 15:06.005
Me, too,

15:06.007 --> 15:08.040
but what's
with this guy Alan?

15:08.042 --> 15:09.843
Oh, I'm sorry.

15:09.845 --> 15:11.544
He recently came
into a lot of money

15:11.546 --> 15:13.880
and he's not really
handling it well.

15:13.882 --> 15:15.481
Not handling it well?

15:15.483 --> 15:17.650
He's a big, fizzy douche.

15:18.736 --> 15:20.904
I mean, the way
he was showing off his car.

15:20.906 --> 15:23.656
Geez, how small is his penis?

15:24.658 --> 15:27.727
Those two things
aren't always related.

15:27.729 --> 15:29.913
Okay, I-I don't know, that watch

15:29.915 --> 15:32.732
is definitely overcompensating
for something.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.834
Some people just like
nice stuff,

15:34.836 --> 15:38.004
even people
with really big penises.

15:38.006 --> 15:40.423
Well, everyone likes nice stuff,

15:40.425 --> 15:42.675
but he didn't have to be
such a jackass about it.

15:42.677 --> 15:45.545
I know, but, I mean,
he's helping me out,

15:45.547 --> 15:46.746
letting me live with him.

15:46.748 --> 15:47.847
I get it.

15:47.849 --> 15:49.081
It still doesn't give him
the right

15:49.083 --> 15:50.800
to treat you the way he does.

15:50.802 --> 15:52.185
You should say something.

15:52.187 --> 15:54.187
Oh, I intend to.

15:55.723 --> 15:58.608
You know, before he arrived,

15:58.610 --> 16:00.226
I was about to do something.

16:00.228 --> 16:01.728
So was I.

you're out of both.

We're going to a free concert
in the park.

16:25.286 --> 16:27.086
It's a Van Halen tribute band.

16:27.088 --> 16:28.638
Well, actually,
it's not a band.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.757
It's just a guy named Dan Halen.

16:30.759 --> 16:33.309

living my life.

16:33.311 --> 16:34.894
I've never had that experience.

16:34.896 --> 16:36.429
Well, it's all
because of Kate.

16:36.431 --> 16:37.764
And the best part is,

16:37.766 --> 16:38.898
she likes me for me.

16:38.900 --> 16:41.567
Uh, technically,
she likes you for <i>me.</i>

16:41.569 --> 16:44.821
Which is ironic 'cause
she doesn't like you at all.

16:44.823 --> 16:46.906
So, uh, what's the plan here?

16:46.908 --> 16:48.140

16:52.814 --> 16:54.280
I don't know.

16:54.282 --> 16:55.581
Haven't really thought
that far ahead.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.867
Actually, I'm kind of afraid
to think that far ahead.

16:57.869 --> 16:59.118

16:59.120 --> 17:00.486
you can keep up this Prince

Good, 'cause they include
washing the dishes

18:21.286 --> 18:22.902

18:39.938 --> 18:41.921
Okay, I got to tell you,

18:41.923 --> 18:43.973
you are much better kisser
than Alan.

18:49.196 --> 18:51.681
Are you sure about this?
Mm.

18:51.683 --> 18:54.784
It's like Dan Halen says,
"Might as well jump."

18:54.786 --> 18:57.320
Well, when are
you coming back?

18:57.322 --> 18:58.897
I don't know.

18:58.922 --> 19:00.407
Walden, have you really
thought this through?

19:00.408 --> 19:03.626
I know it's crazy, but I got to
see where this goes with Kate.

19:03.628 --> 19:06.662
All right, I'm just concerned
about my friend.

19:06.664 --> 19:08.831
I appreciate that.

19:08.833 --> 19:09.882
I'm gonna be fine.

19:09.884 --> 19:11.417
Mm. Good luck.

19:11.419 --> 19:13.035
And, uh, don't worry
about anything here.

19:13.037 --> 19:14.370
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

19:14.372 --> 19:16.506
Well, bye.
Bye.

19:17.841 --> 19:20.476
Finally, you're mine!
You're all mine!

19:20.478 --> 19:23.262
♪ Men.

19:28.998 --> 19:30.148
♪ Men.

19:30.150 --> 19:32.935
So my porn name would be
Snowball Honeysuckle.

19:33.237 --> 19:34.452
(laughs)

19:34.454 --> 19:35.954
Oh, that is so cute.

19:35.956 --> 19:38.223
I would download every
one of your films.

19:38.225 --> 19:39.891
What would yours be?

19:39.893 --> 19:43.195
Beebo Eighty-ninth Street.

19:43.197 --> 19:45.430
Guess it's not a foolproof system.
Mm.

19:46.599 --> 19:47.899
Hey, I have
to ask you a question.

19:47.901 --> 19:49.768
He was a fish.

19:49.770 --> 19:51.970
Thanks, but no.

19:51.972 --> 19:55.941
Um... why are you with me?

19:55.943 --> 19:57.943
What kind of a
question is that?

19:57.945 --> 20:01.830
I don't know. Just,
I don't have much to offer,

20:01.832 --> 20:05.801
and a beautiful,
smart girl like you

20:05.803 --> 20:07.619
could probably get
any guy she wants.

20:07.621 --> 20:09.704
But I did get
the guy I want.

20:09.706 --> 20:11.106
Good answer.

20:11.108 --> 20:12.541
(laughs)

20:12.543 --> 20:15.043
Just promise
me one thing.

20:15.045 --> 20:16.930
What's that?

20:16.955 --> 20:18.955
That we're always
honest with each other.

20:20.833 --> 20:23.785
No secrets, no lies.

20:27.123 --> 20:29.291
You got it.

20:31.477 --> 20:33.511
Good night, Kate.

20:33.513 --> 20:35.680
Good night, Sam.

20:36.566 --> 20:39.317
(sighing)

20:44.257 --> 20:46.208
Kate?

20:46.210 --> 20:47.993
Yeah?

20:47.995 --> 20:49.277
I'm a billionaire.

20:49.279 --> 20:51.713
Of course you are,
Snowball.

20:54.656 --> 20:58.242
Hey, you kids,
get off my beach!

20:58.244 --> 21:03.244
