01:14.240 --> 01:15.390
How far to Hexham?

01:15.480 --> 01:16.516
It's not far.

01:20.160 --> 01:21.150
Are you sure?

01:21.280 --> 01:22.396
Yes!

01:28.560 --> 01:30.392
Ragnar! Rollo!

02:04.360 --> 02:06.397
Let's attack
straightaway.

02:08.080 --> 02:09.309
No.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.680
We attack tomorrow.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.755
Why wait?

02:19.280 --> 02:21.556
It is
a large town.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.118
We have only a few men.

02:24.240 --> 02:26.880
Then surprise is
our biggest advantage.

02:27.040 --> 02:28.030
Arne.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.079
What day is it today?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.395
Saturday.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.753
Then we attack tomorrow.

02:38.240 --> 02:40.471
Why?
You will
understand tomorrow.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.880
<i>Wh o we re
th e s e s tra n g e rs?</i>

02:45.080 --> 02:46.753
I cannot say.

02:46.920 --> 02:48.593
Their ship was sighted
sailing up the coast.

02:49.080 --> 02:50.480
It was a ship
unlike any other.

02:50.600 --> 02:51.750
They were not Franks then?

02:51.880 --> 02:54.634
No. They looked
very different
and used axes.

02:55.160 --> 02:56.640
Most were
as tall as giants.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.513
Sire, I fear
that these raiders
are the same pagans

03:00.600 --> 03:02.637
who attacked
the monastery
at Lindisfarne.

03:03.120 --> 03:06.397
It is the letter
Abbot Alcuin wrote to you
of those terrible events.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.194
"They came
to the church
at Lindisfarne.

03:13.440 --> 03:16.353
"Laid everything waste
with grievous plundering.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.111
"Trampled the holy place
with polluted steps.

03:20.480 --> 03:22.073
"Dug up the altars

03:22.160 --> 03:25.232
"and seized
all the treasure
of the holy church.

03:26.120 --> 03:28.112
"They killed
some of the brothers,

03:28.280 --> 03:30.397
"took some away
with them in fetters,

03:31.280 --> 03:33.192
"some they drowned
in the sea."

03:34.960 --> 03:36.713
Where do they come from,
these pagans?

03:37.160 --> 03:38.674
Some say
from the north.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.800
Well, wherever
they come from,

03:42.000 --> 03:43.957
they are not welcome
in my kingdom.

03:56.480 --> 03:58.358
Take care today.

03:58.720 --> 04:01.155
Don't take
any foolish risks.

04:01.280 --> 04:04.990
And don't
get separated
from the others.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.637
I was just going
to say the same thing
to you, my love.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.398
Enough of that talk.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.315
It's getting light,
and we've wasted
too much time already.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.557
We must wait
a little longer.

04:17.720 --> 04:20.029
Wait?
What for?

04:20.120 --> 04:21.110
Just wait!

04:21.440 --> 04:22.510
For what?

04:22.600 --> 04:24.319
And listen!

04:30.760 --> 04:32.353
I don't hear
anything.

04:40.600 --> 04:42.319
Well, what are you
waiting for?

06:53.040 --> 06:54.474
Get out of the way!

07:02.000 --> 07:04.151
In the name of God,
who are you?

07:06.680 --> 07:08.160
Why have you
come here?

07:08.760 --> 07:10.672
This is a place of God.

07:12.520 --> 07:16.355
If you do not resist,
we will not hurt you.

07:17.840 --> 07:20.196
Tell that to your
people, priest.

07:21.440 --> 07:23.318
Tell them
not to be afraid.

07:24.720 --> 07:25.915
God bless.

10:09.240 --> 10:10.276
Mom!

10:21.360 --> 10:23.238
Knut!
Leave her alone!

10:26.920 --> 10:28.195
Leave her alone!

10:28.360 --> 10:30.477
What do you care
for this Saxon,
you bitch?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.639
Where is Knut?

11:44.640 --> 11:46.597
Where is Knut?

11:47.360 --> 11:48.999
I killed him.

11:56.600 --> 11:58.796
You killed him?

11:59.520 --> 12:01.000
He raped
a Saxon woman.

12:01.160 --> 12:03.117
Then he tried
to rape me.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.672
Did anyone else
see it happen?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.799
That's a pity.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.832
And where were you?

12:41.800 --> 12:42.995
Hold!

12:47.200 --> 12:48.475
What is it?

12:48.880 --> 12:50.712
Who is there?

13:16.280 --> 13:17.396
Archers to forward!

13:17.480 --> 13:18.709
Shield wall!

13:22.200 --> 13:23.190
Down!

13:39.440 --> 13:40.590
Stand!

13:45.560 --> 13:46.710
Brace!

13:57.200 --> 13:58.714
Open!

14:05.080 --> 14:07.037
Up into the
overturned keel.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.919
Clamber, with a heart
of steel.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.516
Cold is the ocean's spray.

14:14.480 --> 14:16.949
When your death
is on its way.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.279
With maidens
you have had
your way.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.392
Each must die some day!

15:08.320 --> 15:10.073
- Hakon!
- Close the wall!

15:10.160 --> 15:11.560
Shield wall!

15:36.480 --> 15:37.470
Go!

16:04.920 --> 16:06.957
How could this happen,
My Lord Wigea?

16:07.040 --> 16:09.191
Sire, I have
never in my life
seen men fight

16:09.320 --> 16:10.640
as these
northmen fight.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.916
Believe me,
there's something devilish
in the way they look,

16:13.120 --> 16:15.760
in their lack of fear
in the face of death.

16:15.960 --> 16:19.078
My Lord, that is just
a counsel of despair.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.870
Are these pagans
not men, like we are?

16:22.400 --> 16:24.392
Do they not bleed
when they are cut?

16:24.680 --> 16:26.990
Or do they have wings
and tongues of fire?

16:27.080 --> 16:28.275
No, sire.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.680
Who are they?

16:34.760 --> 16:36.797
We captured
two of them who were
guarding their boat.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.038
We couldn't
understand anything
they said at all,

16:39.120 --> 16:40.998
except one word.

16:41.960 --> 16:43.235
Ragnar.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.274
Ragnar.

16:59.120 --> 17:00.839
Do you have
any family, priest?

17:02.120 --> 17:03.873
I had four brothers
and a sister.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.830
They all died of a fever,
like my mother and father.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.670
I was only saved
because they had me
placed in a monastery

17:09.760 --> 17:10.829
when I was just a child.

17:11.920 --> 17:13.273
They had too many
mouths to feed.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.790
So you are alone?

17:15.440 --> 17:16.430
No.

17:17.000 --> 17:19.037
God is my father,
so I am never alone.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.915
What does your god
look like?

17:22.800 --> 17:24.154
No one can know what
God looks like.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.233
It would be like
looking into the sun.

17:27.520 --> 17:28.795
It cannot be done.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.437
But he did send his only son
to live on the Earth

17:31.600 --> 17:32.750
and he looked like a man.

17:33.440 --> 17:35.352
Odin, Thor and Loki
are like men,

17:35.640 --> 17:36.835
or are they your gods?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.476
They aren't gods.

17:39.000 --> 17:40.275
They don't exist.

17:45.080 --> 17:46.070
Bjorn.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.511
Death was on its way
to take Kauko.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.874
Don't grieve for him.
Don't pity him.

18:13.440 --> 18:14.351
Guess where
he is now?

18:14.720 --> 18:17.076
Valkyries have
taken him home
to Valhalla.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.996
Right at this moment
he is...

18:23.120 --> 18:25.191
He is drinking ale
with the gods.

18:27.400 --> 18:28.629
Yes.

18:30.760 --> 18:32.831
He is happier
than even we are.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.034
With our boat and...

18:37.600 --> 18:38.636
These goods.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.229
Even so,
he was my kinsman.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.478
We must avenge
his death.

18:46.840 --> 18:49.196
It was done
in the name
of King Aelle,

18:49.840 --> 18:52.116
and King Aelle
must suffer for it.

18:52.440 --> 18:53.715
One day, he will.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.193
If the gods will it.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.994
Look at him,

19:09.560 --> 19:10.914
he's wetting himself.

19:13.600 --> 19:15.193
You kept your word.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.919
You took us to the town,
and I thank you for that.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.080
Drink.

19:37.880 --> 19:39.280
You want to live?

19:52.760 --> 19:54.274
I want to go
to Kattegat.

19:56.360 --> 19:57.999
I want to see
my father
return soon.

19:58.480 --> 20:00.278
He must return soon.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.154
I gave your father
my word that I would
look after you both here.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.032
You are not
looking after us.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.634
We look after ourselves.

20:11.640 --> 20:14.633
I cannot allow you to go
on your own to Kattegat.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.030
Your father
would never tolerate
such a thing.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.554
Then we should
go together.

20:21.360 --> 20:22.953
The three of us.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.471
And who will then
look after the farm?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.158
For what we are
about to receive,

20:30.240 --> 20:31.754
may the Lord make
us truly grateful.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.400
Amen.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.190
Can I have
some ale?

20:48.720 --> 20:51.155
You're too young,
Gyda, to drink ale.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.710
I want to make
a sacrifice to Thor,

21:05.320 --> 21:06.959
for my father's
safe return.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.634
What will you sacrifice?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.434
You!

21:34.040 --> 21:35.997
Where are you, Lord?

21:38.040 --> 21:39.554
Tell me.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.434
Is it your will
that I am here
with these heathens?

21:46.760 --> 21:48.717
How does it serve you?

21:52.800 --> 21:54.439
I don't understand.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.111
And for the first time
in my life,

22:01.320 --> 22:03.073
I am angry with you.

22:07.000 --> 22:10.152
You allow my brothers
to be slaughtered and sold.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.792
Is this really your will?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.752
For the first time,

22:22.600 --> 22:24.353
I feel lonely.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.153
Where are you, Lord?

22:33.680 --> 22:35.433
Where are you?

22:37.600 --> 22:40.115
And why don't
you answer me?

23:04.000 --> 23:05.639
It's just an owl.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.275
Bjorn.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.034
Bjorn, wake up.

23:27.240 --> 23:29.152
What is it?

23:29.840 --> 23:32.992
We'll go to Kattegat.
All of us, tomorrow.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.074
Kattegat!

24:22.720 --> 24:25.554
Ragnar Lothbrok,
my friend,

24:27.400 --> 24:28.834
how was your voyage?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.439
Successful, I hope,

24:31.600 --> 24:33.193
for all our sakes.

24:37.200 --> 24:41.114
The Saxons attacked us
when we returned
to the boat,

24:41.840 --> 24:43.672
in great force,

24:45.800 --> 24:48.156
but we defeated them!

24:50.800 --> 24:52.917
You are the man that
people say you are.

24:53.280 --> 24:55.237
A great adventurer,

24:55.560 --> 24:58.234
and I am happy to salute
your achievements

24:59.600 --> 25:01.990
and to share
in the profit
of your raid.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.719
But I don't see
my friend, Knut.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.553
Where is he?

25:13.920 --> 25:15.434
Knut is dead.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.314
Dead?

25:20.160 --> 25:21.389
Did he die in battle?

25:22.200 --> 25:23.680
No.

25:26.320 --> 25:28.118
Then how did he die?

25:31.600 --> 25:33.273
I killed him.

25:35.360 --> 25:36.919
You killed him.

25:39.040 --> 25:40.269
For what reason?

25:45.640 --> 25:49.031
Because he tried
to rape my wife,

25:50.040 --> 25:51.030
Lagertha.

25:52.120 --> 25:54.476
I find it too convenient

25:54.560 --> 25:56.677
that you would
make an excuse

25:56.760 --> 25:58.592
to kill my friend

25:58.760 --> 26:01.116
and my agent
on your voyage.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.837
What did you think
that you would gain
by getting rid of him?

26:07.480 --> 26:09.039
I didn't expect
to gain anything.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.315
I don't believe you.

26:14.520 --> 26:16.557
Arrest him!

26:16.800 --> 26:17.836
My Lord!

26:18.840 --> 26:21.799
For your wife, Siggy,
would have you
not done the same?

26:26.200 --> 26:28.760
I would counsel you all
against such actions.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.991
There is no way
you could prevail.

26:34.840 --> 26:35.990
Floki.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.554
Bring him away.

26:42.840 --> 26:45.036
Ragnar! Ragnar!

27:01.720 --> 27:04.076
You summoned
me, Lord?

27:05.840 --> 27:08.036
Yes, I want
to talk to you.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.999
Please, sit. Drink.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.232
It's...

27:25.760 --> 27:27.353
It's a delicate matter.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.069
You...

27:30.440 --> 27:33.080
You are the brother
of Ragnar Lothbrok,
are you not?

27:33.400 --> 27:34.550
I am.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.720
A spirited man,
your brother.

27:39.040 --> 27:41.032
Is he a fair man?

27:43.000 --> 27:46.072
Does he treat you equally
when you sail with him?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.034
Up to a point.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.113
Forgive me, but I think
that he likes to rule you.

27:57.080 --> 27:58.514
And that whatever he says,

27:58.600 --> 28:03.231
in actual fact,
he considers himself
to be first among equals.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.349
Am I correct?

28:08.920 --> 28:10.593
I get the impression
that he wants

28:11.800 --> 28:13.598
to take the credit
for everything.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.520
For building the boat,
for sailing west.

28:17.440 --> 28:19.511
He wants to be the hero.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.279
Is that what
it comes down to?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.070
To him?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.555
Would he have achieved
what he has achieved

28:31.280 --> 28:32.953
if it wasn't for you?

28:38.120 --> 28:39.998
What do you say, Rollo?

28:48.080 --> 28:49.639
Of course not.

28:52.320 --> 28:53.993
It would have
been impossible.

28:56.320 --> 28:58.152
As long as I am Earl,

28:59.080 --> 29:01.151
Ragnar Lothbrok
can give you nothing.

29:01.880 --> 29:04.270
I, on the other hand,
can give you a great deal.

29:06.320 --> 29:09.233
I could, for example,
confiscate the treasure

29:09.320 --> 29:11.835
that you brought
back from England.

29:12.080 --> 29:14.151
And offer you
a goodly portion of it.

29:18.520 --> 29:19.920
Would you
do that, Lord?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.349
I might.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.589
Depends.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.080
On what would
it depend?

29:26.800 --> 29:27.995
Your ambition.

29:28.240 --> 29:29.799
You want to stand out.

29:29.960 --> 29:31.679
You want to be
someone, Rollo.

29:31.920 --> 29:34.276
You want the gods
to notice you, yes?

29:35.600 --> 29:36.750
They would have
noticed me already.

29:36.840 --> 29:39.355
Oh, no, my friend.
And do you know why?

29:40.200 --> 29:43.830
Because you still walk
in the shadow
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.390
Don't you think it's time
you stepped out from it,

29:46.680 --> 29:49.275
and let the gods see you
for who you really are?

29:54.560 --> 29:55.596
Oh.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.236
I want you to say
hello to somebody.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.676
This is my
daughter, Thyri.

30:08.920 --> 30:10.479
She is soon
to get married,

30:10.680 --> 30:14.230
and I must think
very carefully about
her future husband.

30:15.840 --> 30:18.480
He must be
a man of ambition
and prospect,

30:18.560 --> 30:19.789
as you can understand.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.233
I used to have two boys,
but they were killed.

30:26.360 --> 30:30.400
So the man that I choose
to be my son-in-law

30:31.200 --> 30:33.999
will hold a high
and special place,

30:35.040 --> 30:37.316
as if he were
my own son.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.549
Thyri, say
hello to Rollo.

30:43.960 --> 30:45.110
Hello.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.080
Hello.

30:48.200 --> 30:49.634
Don't forget
about me, my love.

30:50.320 --> 30:51.674
Oh, yes.

30:51.760 --> 30:53.592
And this is Siggy,
my wife.

30:54.760 --> 30:56.160
This is Rollo.

30:57.240 --> 31:00.916
He is the brother
of Ragnar Lothbrok.

31:02.760 --> 31:04.274
Hello, Rollo.

31:05.120 --> 31:06.474
I have heard
a lot about you.

31:06.560 --> 31:10.474
They say that you
are a great warrior.

31:52.360 --> 31:53.680
Bring in the prisoner.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.798
That murderer!

32:02.320 --> 32:04.676
Free him!
Free Ragnar!

32:05.520 --> 32:08.115
Look at him!
He's in chains.

32:10.840 --> 32:12.433
It's all right, boy.

32:12.720 --> 32:16.839
We are all aware
of the sacred nature
of our duty here.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.992
You stand
before us accused
of the willful murder

32:21.120 --> 32:23.077
of Knut, my brother.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.679
Knut, as some
of you may know,

32:27.400 --> 32:30.154
was the bastard son
of my father.

32:31.920 --> 32:34.435
But I loved him

32:35.720 --> 32:37.279
like a brother.

32:38.680 --> 32:40.034
I asked Knut

32:40.120 --> 32:42.555
to go with
Ragnar Lothbrok
to England,

32:42.720 --> 32:46.270
where they raided
a town and brought
back many spoils.

32:47.080 --> 32:49.356
And while they were
raiding this town,

32:49.640 --> 32:51.791
Ragnar Lothbrok
took it upon himself

32:53.480 --> 32:56.871
to cold-bloodedly
kill my brother.

32:58.440 --> 33:01.877
It's easy to imagine
why a man like this
would do such a thing.

33:04.080 --> 33:06.640
This is an ambitious man.

33:07.720 --> 33:10.076
He doesn't care
to share his spoils.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.914
And he resents the fact

33:13.040 --> 33:17.000
that he owes me
loyalty and obedience,
as his chieftain.

33:20.240 --> 33:24.553
This is a man who
does not believe
in our traditions.

33:26.440 --> 33:29.797
This is a man
who does not believe
in our laws.

33:33.440 --> 33:35.511
Silence! Silence!

33:36.840 --> 33:38.194
What do you
have to say,

33:38.920 --> 33:43.153
when you stand before us,
and know that you
must tell the truth?

33:45.120 --> 33:47.237
It is true that
I killed Knut.

33:48.680 --> 33:51.275
Sadly, your brother.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.473
But I killed him

33:55.800 --> 33:58.110
when I found him
trying to rape my wife.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.320
I ask all of
you free men,

34:07.720 --> 34:11.839
what would have you done
if you were in my place?

34:13.080 --> 34:15.036
Would have you
just stood back,

34:17.520 --> 34:19.670
encouraged the culprit?

34:26.320 --> 34:28.232
I don't think you would.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.877
And even if
I had've known
at the time

34:33.520 --> 34:35.273
he was your brother,

34:36.760 --> 34:38.831
I would have carried out
the same sentence.

34:39.440 --> 34:43.150
Do you seriously ask us
to believe your story?

34:44.000 --> 34:45.559
I can confirm the story.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.675
You are the wife
of Ragnar Lothbrok?

34:51.400 --> 34:52.800
I am, Lord.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.636
How extraordinary that
you happened to be there

34:56.719 --> 34:58.677
at the same time.

34:59.320 --> 35:01.755
Your husband is lying.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.152
And you are so
under his thumb

35:04.240 --> 35:06.436
that he has persuaded
you to lie for him.

35:06.520 --> 35:09.194
May Thor strike
you dead!

35:17.120 --> 35:18.190
What did you say?

35:18.360 --> 35:21.353
My husband
did not kill
Knut Tjodolf.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.000
Then who did?
I did!

35:23.880 --> 35:24.870
I killed him.

35:25.040 --> 35:28.477
I stabbed him in the
heart when he tried
his best to rape me.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.634
A murder is committed

35:31.760 --> 35:35.549
and the only witnesses
are a husband and his wife.

35:37.800 --> 35:40.190
Unfortunately, we can't tell
who committed the crime,

35:40.280 --> 35:42.397
because they both
claim credit for it.

35:45.240 --> 35:46.720
You didn't kill
my brother.

35:47.240 --> 35:48.879
Look at you,
how could you?

35:49.720 --> 35:51.473
He killed my brother.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.991
Ragnar Lothbrok
killed my brother.

35:55.720 --> 35:56.915
We have proof.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.312
We have a witness
to the killing.

36:13.120 --> 36:17.239
You say you are
a witness to the death
of Knut Tjodolf?

36:17.920 --> 36:18.990
Yes.

36:19.080 --> 36:21.072
You'll swear this
upon your arm ring?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.911
Yes, I was there.

36:25.680 --> 36:27.194
I saw everything.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.429
So, who killed
my brother?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.474
Ragnar Lothbrok
killed him.

36:40.800 --> 36:42.234
In cold blood?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.394
No, Lord.

36:46.560 --> 36:47.880
For a good reason.

36:49.440 --> 36:52.194
What Ragnar Lothbrok
has sworn is true.

36:54.760 --> 36:57.195
Your half-brother was caught
raping a Saxon woman.

36:57.280 --> 36:59.476
Then he attempted to rape
Ragnar's lawful wife,

36:59.800 --> 37:02.315
Lagertha, the shield-maiden.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.793
So unfortunately,

37:06.800 --> 37:08.314
you cannot punish him.

37:13.080 --> 37:14.514
Now, who has the key?

37:29.680 --> 37:31.911
Come, Bjorn.
Like father,
like son.

37:36.680 --> 37:38.512
It seems I owe you
an eternal debt.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.635
I know.

37:42.600 --> 37:44.034
And I look forward
to collecting it.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.111
Let's drink
a toast to Ragnar!

37:49.840 --> 37:52.480
To his future
and his freedom!

37:52.760 --> 37:54.399
No, no, no, no.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.999
To friends
and freedom!

37:58.480 --> 38:00.437
To friends and freedom!

38:01.160 --> 38:02.958
To you, my friend!

38:03.680 --> 38:05.911
You'll never
be free of us!

38:15.360 --> 38:17.033
Will you drink
with me?

38:17.520 --> 38:18.874
Of course.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.796
Thank you
for taking care
of my children.

38:28.680 --> 38:30.239
You're a good Christian.

38:35.720 --> 38:37.473
I wanted to say
thank you.

38:38.280 --> 38:40.033
You did a fine
good thing, Rollo.

38:40.240 --> 38:41.913
I hope the gods
were watching.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.358
I didn't do
it for him.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.476
I did it for you,
shield-maiden.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.718
I don't want
to believe that.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.076
So, Ragnar!

38:58.200 --> 39:01.477
Did you see Haraldson's face
when he had to acquit you

39:01.560 --> 39:03.392
and then give you
half his hoard?

39:03.480 --> 39:04.755
He looked like this!

39:36.280 --> 39:37.919
Ragnar Lothbrok?

39:38.320 --> 39:39.754
I am unarmed.

39:45.480 --> 39:46.630
Get the children.

39:51.800 --> 39:52.950
Hurry!

40:27.320 --> 40:28.549
Father.

41:49.640 --> 41:52.075
Stones and bones.

41:53.400 --> 41:55.631
Stones and bones.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.910
What do
you read?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.799
Wait. Not so
impatient, Lord.

42:01.960 --> 42:03.553
Tell me.

42:03.800 --> 42:05.359
Ask me a question.

42:07.440 --> 42:10.956
Are the
signs threatening?

42:11.280 --> 42:12.396
Yes.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.353
There is a quarrel.

42:16.440 --> 42:18.272
There will be violence.

42:19.680 --> 42:22.991
Bones and skulls broken.
I see that.

42:32.600 --> 42:34.637
What is Ragnar doing
sitting on the hillside?

42:40.320 --> 42:42.437
He searches
for your death.

42:43.960 --> 42:49.080
Consults the gods
to whom he claims
kinship.

42:50.440 --> 42:52.318
Who could believe
such a thing?

42:55.480 --> 42:57.995
Does he desire
to be Earl?

43:00.240 --> 43:02.880
If he kills you,
will it not be so?

43:06.720 --> 43:08.791
Do the gods speak?

43:09.680 --> 43:11.512
Do they ever stop?

43:13.200 --> 43:16.159
Gods have always
been favorable to me.

43:18.680 --> 43:21.195
They allowed
your sons to die.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.513
Do the gods

43:30.920 --> 43:33.151
really exist?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.595
I know what he's doing.

44:04.600 --> 44:06.239
He's preparing himself.
