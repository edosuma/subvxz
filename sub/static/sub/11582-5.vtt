00:01.335 --> 00:03.137
In the criminal
justice system,

00:03.171 --> 00:04.605
sexually-based offenses

00:04.638 --> 00:06.540
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.543
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.577 --> 00:11.179
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.212 --> 00:12.713
are members of an elite squad

00:12.746 --> 00:14.582
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.615 --> 00:17.251
These are their stories.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.288
Took the family to see
the Statue of Liberty yesterday.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.655
Give me your tired,
your poor,

00:21.689 --> 00:23.524
your homicidal
taxi drivers.

00:23.557 --> 00:26.060
Kids loved it.
You know how long her schnoz is?

00:26.094 --> 00:27.561
4 1/2 feet.

00:27.595 --> 00:29.430
We took the tour too.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.666
Got us another bum.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.335
Hey!

00:34.368 --> 00:37.338
Hey, you in there!
Hey!

00:39.240 --> 00:40.741
Oh, Lord!

00:40.774 --> 00:42.376
[crying]
Please, don't hurt me!

00:42.410 --> 00:45.246
Nobody's gonna hurt you.

00:45.279 --> 00:46.647
Call an ambulance, Jeff!

00:46.680 --> 00:49.250
Hurry!

00:49.283 --> 00:51.519
What the hell
you waiting for?!

00:51.552 --> 00:53.287
I know her.

00:53.321 --> 00:54.622
Look at this.

00:54.655 --> 00:58.126
She's that girl that's been
missing since Friday.

00:58.159 --> 00:59.793
Tandi.

01:02.130 --> 01:03.364
It's Tandi McCann,
all right.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.299
Workers found her
tied up with duct tape.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.834
They the ones
who called the press?

01:06.867 --> 01:08.636
Yeah, hot line's been
all over the papers and TV.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.603
What is this building?

01:09.637 --> 01:11.472
Hudson University's
new dorm.

01:11.505 --> 01:12.540
(Benson)
Is Tandi hurt?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.242
(Uni)
She's pretty shook up.

01:14.275 --> 01:15.209
All she said
is she was raped.

01:15.243 --> 01:17.578
Stop taking photographs,
okay?

01:17.611 --> 01:19.213
This is my daughter.

01:19.247 --> 01:21.582
If she doesn't wanna go,
she doesn't have to go.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.417
Sir, your daughter needs
to be seen by a doctor.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.485
I will
bring her in later.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.654
I want to take her home
and get her cleaned up.

01:26.687 --> 01:27.855
Her mother
is worried sick.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.490
Let's calm down here.
Are you her father?

01:29.523 --> 01:31.492
I'm her stepfather.
Who are you?

01:31.525 --> 01:33.661
I'm Detective Stabler.
My partner, Detective Benson.

01:33.694 --> 01:34.495
You the ones that called
these vultures?

01:34.528 --> 01:36.497
No, Mr. McCain,
we're here to help.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.698
Tandi's been through
enough already.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.333
(Tandi)
No, Daddy, just take me--

01:39.367 --> 01:40.501
That's it!
She's comin' with me!

01:40.534 --> 01:42.736
I'm sorry, Mr. McCain,
but Tandi is a minor,

01:42.770 --> 01:43.871
and under
the Social Service law,

01:43.904 --> 01:45.339
she needs to have
a medical examination.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.540
I'm her father.
Don't I get a say?

01:46.574 --> 01:47.908
Take her
to St. Catherine's.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.243
Daddy, don't let them!

01:49.277 --> 01:51.612
Daddy!
Daddy, please!

01:51.645 --> 01:52.846
It's okay, baby.
I'll meet you there.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.382
Daddy! No!

01:54.415 --> 01:55.616
I'm sorry.
That's what's best for Tandi.

01:55.649 --> 01:58.118
Yeah, well,
we'll see about that.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.690
Social Services law?
What was that crap?

02:02.723 --> 02:04.525
If Tandi goes home,
we lose our evidence.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.927
Bastard gets away with it,
and he rapes another kid.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.596
Liv, you crossed the line.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.532
That girl is too young and too
scared to think for herself.

02:11.565 --> 02:14.302
So you're gonna think
for her now, huh?

02:16.237 --> 02:18.372
What else could I do?

03:11.659 --> 03:13.761
What happened out there,
Olivia?

03:13.794 --> 03:16.264
Stepfather tried to pull Tandi
out of the ambulance.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.298
Liv just did
what she had to do

03:17.331 --> 03:18.266
to make sure
we have a case.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.301
Well, dad's telling the press
you lied to him,

03:20.334 --> 03:21.369
and deliberately
ignored his wishes.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.536
His wishes?

03:22.570 --> 03:23.571
I thought we act
for the victim,

03:23.604 --> 03:24.738
not her parents.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.374
Problem is,
now he's threatening

03:26.407 --> 03:27.441
to withhold the rape kit.

03:27.475 --> 03:29.477
Why?
He's upset.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.711
His daughter's traumatized.

03:30.744 --> 03:31.879
They just want this
to go away.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.447
Okay, I'll talk
to Tandi.

03:33.481 --> 03:36.417
No, no.
Elliot will.

03:36.450 --> 03:38.619
You bumping me
off this case?

03:38.652 --> 03:40.754
Look, the dad
is madder than hell at you.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.490
Give him some time
to calm down.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.325
Tandi's mother
is on her way in.

03:44.358 --> 03:45.593
Talk to her.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.430
Do you really have
to put her through this?

03:49.463 --> 03:50.398
We do rape kits
on every victim.

03:50.431 --> 03:52.533
And if you don't give us
permission to use it,

03:52.566 --> 03:55.869
the chances of IDing
the assailant are pretty slim.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.038
You do want us to find him,
don't you?

03:58.071 --> 03:59.340
Of course, I do.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.674
Then let her talk
about what happened.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.443
That's the best way
to deal with it.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.478
All right.
But I'm staying.

04:04.512 --> 04:06.013
Good.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.815
Come on.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.950
Could you
give us a minute?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.488
Hi, Tandi.
I'm Elliot.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.956
Can I ask you
a few questions?

04:15.989 --> 04:18.592
I told my dad
everything.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.027
Can you tell me, too?

04:21.629 --> 04:24.598
I was walking
to the bus stop...

04:24.632 --> 04:27.568
and these men asked me
if I wanted to go to a party.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.804
I said no,
and they grabbed me,

04:30.838 --> 04:32.906
and they dragged me
to that room.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.575
How many men?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.544
Two or three.
I'm not sure.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.612
Can you describe them?

04:38.646 --> 04:42.483
Um, it was dark.
I don't know.

04:42.516 --> 04:44.652
Well, were they short,
tall, black, white...

04:44.685 --> 04:46.954
I don't know.

04:46.987 --> 04:50.324
Can you describe
what they were wearing?

04:50.358 --> 04:51.859
Some kind of uniform.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.026
Good.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.328
Well, it's Monday.

04:54.362 --> 04:55.563
Did they keep you
in the same room

04:55.596 --> 04:58.566
all day Saturday, Sunday?

04:58.599 --> 05:03.371
They said if I tried to escape,
they would kill me.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.638
Please.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.940
Please, I want
to see my mom.

05:06.974 --> 05:09.543
Please.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.611
Now, Tandi is still
in high school.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.979
What was she doing
at Hudson?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.814
She's taking
an advanced placement course

05:13.847 --> 05:15.616
over the summer.

05:15.649 --> 05:16.717
To get college credits?

05:16.750 --> 05:18.018
She wants to go to Columbia

05:18.051 --> 05:20.488
to major in English
and French.

05:20.521 --> 05:21.855
She's bright,
works real hard,

05:21.889 --> 05:22.990
never causes
any trouble.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.725
Now, she was studying there
Friday night?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.627
She called to say
that she was working late

05:26.660 --> 05:27.795
at the library.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.597
By 11:30,
we got worried.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.931
Ronald went up
to the university

05:30.964 --> 05:32.533
to look for her.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.667
I called her friends.

05:33.701 --> 05:35.869
So your husband
was home with you?

05:35.903 --> 05:37.004
Yes.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.706
And who
called the police?

05:38.739 --> 05:41.074
I did, around 4:00 a.m.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.143
Why did you wait so long?

05:43.176 --> 05:46.614
I told you, because
Ronald was out looking for her.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.549
Why are you making this
so hard for us?

05:48.582 --> 05:50.684
I'm just trying
to help your daughter.

05:50.718 --> 05:54.755
Well, then, please,
let me see her.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.392
Her rape kit
is negative for fluids,

05:58.426 --> 05:59.860
but positive
for spermicide.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.629
Our attackers used condoms.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.431
Can we prove
it was rape?

06:03.464 --> 06:05.399
Her thighs
are heavily bruised.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.635
Her hymen is torn.
I mean, she definitely had sex.

06:07.668 --> 06:08.769
And she's a virgin.

06:08.802 --> 06:10.604
Any trace evidence
of the perps?

06:10.638 --> 06:11.705
Construction guys
that found her

06:11.739 --> 06:13.474
let her clean
herself up a bit.

06:13.507 --> 06:16.109
Destroying most of the
forensics in the process.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.178
What do you got?
Nada from CSU.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.747
But campus security
broke up a party

06:19.780 --> 06:22.450
at Rochester dorm
around 11:30 Friday night.

06:22.483 --> 06:23.484
Where's the dorm?

06:23.517 --> 06:25.619
Across the street
from where Tandi was found.

06:25.653 --> 06:26.720
The place is crawling

06:26.754 --> 06:28.656
with army cadets
taking summer classes

06:28.689 --> 06:29.990
in military leadership.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.191
Tandi said her attackers
wore uniforms.

06:31.224 --> 06:33.561
When she was heading home
from the library,

06:33.594 --> 06:35.629
did the bus stop here?

06:35.663 --> 06:36.964
She had to pass
Rochester dorm.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.833
Talk to the dean and everybody
who was at that party.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.905
I do regret
what happened,

06:44.938 --> 06:46.540
but you shouldn't
jump to conclusions

06:46.574 --> 06:47.941
just because
military personnel

06:47.975 --> 06:49.109
live across the street.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.578
We just want
to talk to them.

06:50.611 --> 06:51.712
I'm afraid I can't
release any names.

06:51.745 --> 06:54.515
Unless there's direct evidence
of their involvement.

06:54.548 --> 06:55.749
My students have a right
to privacy,

06:55.783 --> 06:57.017
and I have a duty
to protect them.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.719
A girl was
kidnapped and raped

06:58.752 --> 06:59.853
on your campus,
Dr. Lyne.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.755
What's your duty
to her?

07:01.789 --> 07:03.190
We have our own
disciplinary procedures.

07:03.223 --> 07:05.526
If a student is found
to have committed an offense,

07:05.559 --> 07:06.927
it'll be handed over
to the police.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.862
We know all about
college procedures--

07:08.896 --> 07:11.999
Rape victims intimidated,
persuaded to drop charges.

07:12.032 --> 07:13.634
I'm sorry.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.135
I will talk to the parents
of the cadets

07:15.168 --> 07:16.704
who attended this party.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.705
If they wish
to make a statement,

07:17.738 --> 07:18.939
that's their choice.

07:18.972 --> 07:21.742
Now, you're
on private property,

07:21.775 --> 07:24.712
and I must
ask you to leave.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.013
College is closing ranks.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.247
Not tight enough.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.817
Head of campus security
was a cop at the 29.

07:29.850 --> 07:31.785
He gave me four names
of the students he questioned

07:31.819 --> 07:33.987
at the party in Rochester dorm
Friday night.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.856
And their class schedules.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.691
All right, we should wait
till they leave campus.

07:37.725 --> 07:39.126
Divide and conquer.

07:39.159 --> 07:41.194
Tony Storr?

07:41.228 --> 07:42.262
What is this?

07:42.295 --> 07:43.497
Police business.

07:43.531 --> 07:44.765
See this girl
Friday night?

07:44.798 --> 07:46.834
Yes, sir, I did.
Where?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.001
She was at the party
at our dorm.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.870
Are you sure?

07:49.903 --> 07:50.971
Yeah,
she invited herself.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.840
She's sixteen,
Mr. Delvecchio.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.241
She said she was 21.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.644
Said to who?
I don't know.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.846
Acted like she was 21.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.947
How did she do that?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.148
You know,

08:01.181 --> 08:03.050
drinking, dancing,
having a good time.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.251
She dance
with you, Joe?

08:04.284 --> 08:05.719
No, sir.

08:05.753 --> 08:06.787
Why not?
It's your party.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.956
You're a good-looking guy.
She's a nice-looking girl.

08:08.989 --> 08:10.924
I already got
a girlfriend.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.726
Was she at the party?
No, sir.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.227
Were there
any other girls there?

08:14.261 --> 08:15.529
A couple, maybe.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.730
You know their names?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.899
No, sir.
Just sort of bumped into them.

08:18.932 --> 08:20.167
You see Tandi leave?

08:20.200 --> 08:21.902
Nope.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.303
She must have slipped out.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.539
Tandi's face was on the TV

08:25.573 --> 08:26.907
and the newspapers
all weekend long.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.676
How come you didn't
report seeing her?

08:28.709 --> 08:30.878
I guess I just didn't
put two and two together.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.013
Yeah, I can see where
that'd be a problem for you.

08:33.046 --> 08:34.181
Mr. O'Connor.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.817
Trevor Langan
of Henshall and Langan.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.652
Your family's instructed me
to act on your behalf.

08:38.686 --> 08:39.753
You have no right
to question my client

08:39.787 --> 08:41.722
on university property.

08:41.755 --> 08:42.856
Your client is on
a city sidewalk.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.191
I can question him
all I want.

08:44.224 --> 08:45.726
Did you wear that uniform
Friday night?

08:45.759 --> 08:46.827
Don't answer that.
Why not?

08:46.860 --> 08:47.895
'Cause it's immaterial.

08:47.928 --> 08:49.029
Not to me.
It is to me.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.598
Which means
this interview is over.

08:50.631 --> 08:52.099
Come on, Mr. O'Connor.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.139
He give you anything?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.574
Yeah.

09:00.608 --> 09:01.909
Tandi was at that party
Friday night.

09:01.942 --> 09:03.711
That's what
my guy said.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.812
You think
that little detail

09:04.845 --> 09:06.213
just happened to slip
Tandi's mind?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.948
Let's go ask her.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.757
Has Tandi
said anything yet?

09:16.790 --> 09:18.659
Have you got any leads?
Can we talk to Tandi?

09:18.692 --> 09:20.027
Hey, Stabler.
Hey, Jim.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.629
Anything
you can tell me?

09:21.662 --> 09:22.796
Yeah--go home.

09:22.830 --> 09:23.964
You know him?

09:23.997 --> 09:25.833
Friends from high school.
Jamie Barragon.

09:25.866 --> 09:26.900
Tandi's big news.

09:26.934 --> 09:29.002
Yeah...till
the next big news.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.904
Detectives, can we
get a statement, please?

09:30.938 --> 09:32.840
[reporters
talking all at once]

09:32.873 --> 09:35.308
(Benson)
Were you at that party, Tandi?

09:35.342 --> 09:36.376
Of course,
she wasn't.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.245
Some of the people there
say she was.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.680
(Ronald)
What people?

09:39.713 --> 09:40.781
Army cadets.

09:40.814 --> 09:42.282
They're lying!

09:42.315 --> 09:43.951
Those are the uniformed bastards
that raped her.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.953
Tandi, we're on your side.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.387
We just need to know
exactly what happened,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.356
that's all.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.391
Tell him, baby.
Were you at the party?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.293
No! I was walking
to the bus stop,

09:53.326 --> 09:54.828
and they grabbed me.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.330
Why is everyone
telling lies about me?

09:57.364 --> 09:59.800
God, I just wish you'd all
just leave me alone.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.272
All four cadets
say Tandi was at the party.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.374
Are you sure
she's not lying?

10:07.407 --> 10:08.909
Even if she was there,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.277
it doesn't give anybody
the right to rape her.

10:10.310 --> 10:12.212
Anything
from the crime scene?

10:12.245 --> 10:14.381
Well, CSU just finished
doing elimination prints

10:14.414 --> 10:16.016
on the family
and the site workers,

10:16.049 --> 10:17.417
so I wouldn't
hold your breath.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.720
Well, I got a press conference
tomorrow at 9:00,

10:19.753 --> 10:22.355
and I would like not
to look like a complete idiot.

10:22.389 --> 10:24.257
Let's use the press.
Give 'em a little information.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.959
See if it
kicks up a lead.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.160
Like what?

10:27.194 --> 10:28.195
Those four cadets
weren't the only ones

10:28.228 --> 10:29.362
at that party.

10:29.396 --> 10:30.597
Why hasn't anyone else
come forward?

10:30.630 --> 10:32.332
(Cragen)
You got anybody
you can trust?

10:32.365 --> 10:34.401
The guy covering
the Tandi case for the Ledger.

10:34.434 --> 10:35.703
He's an old buddy of mine.

10:35.736 --> 10:38.171
Okay...

10:38.205 --> 10:40.007
(Stabler)
The poor kid has been
through enough already.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.709
Why do you have to make
her life more miserable?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.310
Because she's news.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.878
Tens of thousands
go missing every year.

10:44.912 --> 10:46.947
What makes Tandi big news?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.282
Same reason Chandra Levy
and Elizabeth Smart

10:49.316 --> 10:50.884
were big news.

10:50.918 --> 10:53.320
They're young,
cute, and white.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.756
Whatever it takes
to sell your paper.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.390
Is there
any sexual assault?

10:57.424 --> 10:59.059
You know I'm not gonna
answer that.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.161
Please--why else would
the sex cops be involved?

11:01.194 --> 11:03.030
Jamie,
I'm not going there.

11:03.063 --> 11:04.865
Are you still focusing
on the university?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.868
Maybe.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.336
Cadets?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.875
You want my help, Elliot,
you gotta throw me a bone.

11:17.978 --> 11:23.416
We're...interested
in talking to anyone...

11:23.450 --> 11:25.418
who was at a party
in Rochester dorm

11:25.452 --> 11:27.755
Friday night.

11:27.788 --> 11:30.390
Well, maybe you should be
talking to Tandi.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.825
We hear she was
partying up a storm.

11:31.859 --> 11:34.962
Where'd you get that?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.765
The cadets' lawyers?

11:37.798 --> 11:39.733
They're just trying
to dirty up the victim.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.401
So she is a victim?

11:41.434 --> 11:43.436
Come on, Elliot,
off the record.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.039
Are you looking at the cadets
who threw the party?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.041
Off the record?

11:48.075 --> 11:50.243
You bet.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.816
What is this?

11:57.417 --> 11:59.152
Byline's Jamie Barrigan.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.254
That who you
talked to last night?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.389
I didn't give him
any of this.

12:02.422 --> 12:03.924
Well, he got it.

12:03.957 --> 12:05.192
Now he's
named two suspects

12:05.225 --> 12:06.526
and outed Tandi
as a rape victim

12:06.559 --> 12:07.360
to the entire country.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.429
Let me just talk
to the son of a bitch.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.430
No more talking
to the press.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.500
I want to contain the damage,
not spread it.

12:13.533 --> 12:15.502
Gotta get up
to Washington Heights.

12:15.535 --> 12:18.171
911 came in
from a cadet's girlfriend.

12:25.879 --> 12:28.215
Police, get the hell
out of my way.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.326
Manhattan SVU.
Detective Tutuola.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.294
Take it easy.
Tell me what happened.

12:41.328 --> 12:44.832
[crying]
Uh, we were walking
along the street,

12:44.865 --> 12:48.301
when these bastards started
calling Joe a rapist.

12:48.335 --> 12:50.037
And they chased him
into the street,

12:50.070 --> 12:51.238
and straight
into a car.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.505
We get the guys
that chased him?

12:52.539 --> 12:53.841
They disappeared,

12:53.874 --> 12:56.209
just as soon
as his head was...

12:56.243 --> 12:58.478
Why did the papers
print his picture.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.413
He never hurt anyone.

13:00.447 --> 13:04.484
It's okay, Detective,
we got him.

13:04.517 --> 13:07.187
Pulse is slow and thready.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.823
We need to scoop and run.
Let's go.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.362
Hospital says
Joe Eglee's still unconscious.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.363
He's gonna make it?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.265
He's stable.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.100
You can't blame Elliot
for this.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.836
I don't,
but IAB might.

13:22.870 --> 13:25.305
Just tell them exactly
what you told the reporter.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.175
Chief of Detectives,
11: 00.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.142
Chief.

13:29.176 --> 13:30.844
Don.

13:30.878 --> 13:32.846
You Stabler?
Yes, sir.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.081
Why don't we take this
in my office.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.415
A high-profile case

13:35.448 --> 13:37.050
with the media on it
like the measles,

13:37.084 --> 13:39.019
and you go and name
our main suspects.

13:39.052 --> 13:42.055
I didn't name anybody.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.223
So it's just
a coincidence

13:43.256 --> 13:44.557
that the paper's
quoting a source

13:44.591 --> 13:47.594
close
to the investigation.

13:47.627 --> 13:49.162
Why the hell
did you do it?

13:49.196 --> 13:50.898
We needed a lead, sir.

13:50.931 --> 13:52.165
Reporters can go
anywhere cops can

13:52.199 --> 13:54.034
and get people
to talk easier.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.969
This one certainly
got you talking.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.437
Sir, I authorized
Detective Stabler

13:57.470 --> 13:58.972
to give the journalist

13:59.006 --> 13:59.973
something on background.

14:00.007 --> 14:01.141
I don't believe
he gave any names.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.076
Personally, detective,
I'd dump you back into uniform,

14:03.110 --> 14:06.313
but that would look like
we're admitting guilt.

14:06.346 --> 14:09.316
So we have to back you up.

14:09.349 --> 14:11.084
He can stay on
the McCain case, Don,

14:11.118 --> 14:13.186
but no contact
with the cadets,

14:13.220 --> 14:16.223
and zip your mouth
around the press.

14:22.329 --> 14:25.132
Elliot, don't
beat yourself up over this.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.599
The bastards
put that kid in a coma,

14:26.633 --> 14:28.135
they out Tandi
as a rape victim.

14:28.168 --> 14:29.102
I helped them do it.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.670
The press says that Tandi
is a public figure.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.105
That makes her fair game.

14:32.139 --> 14:34.107
There's nothing
that you can do about it.

14:34.141 --> 14:35.475
Oh, yeah?

14:37.210 --> 14:39.112
Come here,
you son of a bitch!

14:39.146 --> 14:41.248
Hey! Hey!
Come on, cool it!

14:41.281 --> 14:42.482
Cool it?
You nearly got that kid killed.

14:42.515 --> 14:43.616
Are you out of your mind?

14:43.650 --> 14:44.985
I didn't chase him
into traffic!

14:45.018 --> 14:46.219
You made damn sure
somebody did!

14:46.253 --> 14:48.021
This is not my fault!
Whose fault is it?

14:48.055 --> 14:49.656
Some other reporter
had the names of the cadets

14:49.689 --> 14:51.324
from someone on campus.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.060
My editor just
put two and two together.

14:53.093 --> 14:54.928
Right, including that bit
about Tandi being raped?

14:54.962 --> 14:56.096
To hell with you.

14:56.129 --> 14:57.230
You're the ones
who gave that away,

14:57.264 --> 14:58.298
just by being there!

14:58.331 --> 15:00.300
Look, I'm sorry, El.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.269
If I didn't run with this story,
somebody else would!

15:02.302 --> 15:04.104
I got a job to do,
too, you know.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.440
Whatever.

15:07.474 --> 15:10.110
Might have
a lead for you.

15:10.143 --> 15:12.479
We got a tip this morning
some guy owns a bodega

15:12.512 --> 15:14.014
near Hudson U.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.283
He says he swears
he saw Tandi in his store

15:16.316 --> 15:17.650
Saturday afternoon.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.552
Why aren't you splashing that
all over your front page?

15:19.586 --> 15:21.188
'Cause we check
our sources.

15:21.221 --> 15:24.057
We can't confirm a word
this guy says.

15:24.091 --> 15:26.193
He's got no
security cameras, nothing.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.594
Plus, he's a weirdo.
What's his name?

15:27.627 --> 15:32.065
Fred.
The store's called Grummond's.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.433
She was standing
right where you are.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.135
What a little cutie.

15:35.168 --> 15:36.669
Tandi McCall.

15:36.703 --> 15:38.538
Tandi McCain.
And what time was this?

15:38.571 --> 15:41.374
Uh, 4:30,
5:30 Saturday.

15:41.408 --> 15:43.710
She came in,
kind of sneaking around,

15:43.743 --> 15:45.612
hiding her face.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.148
Bought a soda
and a sandwich.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.216
You got a receipt?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.319
Yep. Like I told
that reporter,

15:52.352 --> 15:53.686
I can sniff out trouble

15:53.720 --> 15:55.288
the second
it walks in.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.489
Sausage and egg
sandwich

15:56.523 --> 15:58.491
and a can
of Club cola.

15:58.525 --> 16:00.160
Was Tandi alone?

16:00.193 --> 16:01.528
Seemed to be,

16:01.561 --> 16:03.330
but she was jumpy.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.664
Fred, it's obvious
you got a good memory.

16:04.697 --> 16:06.333
You think you'd
recognize her again?

16:06.366 --> 16:08.201
Sure, I could.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.570
That's her.

16:10.603 --> 16:11.704
Yeah.

16:11.738 --> 16:14.274
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.542
Ben, it's Liv.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.710
Look, can you check the lab
for food wrappers

16:17.744 --> 16:20.180
and soda cans found
at the crime scene?

16:20.213 --> 16:22.082
Yeah, great.
Thanks.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.250
Don't get
your hopes up.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.784
He didn't recognize
Tandi's photo?

16:24.817 --> 16:27.654
Recognized
my daughter Kathleen.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.089
Plenty of junk
stuffed behind the walls,

16:29.122 --> 16:30.357
under the floor.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.292
People use the place
like it's a camp site.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.028
But this is definitely
from a four-day-old

16:35.062 --> 16:36.196
sausage and egg sandwich.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.465
You can tell all that from
those little, bitty crumbs?

16:38.498 --> 16:40.300
Nope, from the label.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.634
Well, what do you know?

16:41.668 --> 16:44.137
A partially-crushed can
of Club cola.

16:44.171 --> 16:45.638
I guess Fred wasn't
as big a flake

16:45.672 --> 16:47.107
as Elliot thought.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.375
What else you got?

16:48.408 --> 16:49.342
Roll of duct tape.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.112
The end tear matches
what Tandi was bound with.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.746
We'll run it all for prints.

16:56.416 --> 16:58.051
I'm sorry,
you can't come in.

16:58.085 --> 17:00.320
Tandi's too upset
to talk right now.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.322
The whole world
knows she was raped,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.357
and the papers say
you guys gave it up.

17:04.391 --> 17:05.292
That's not true.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.526
We never release
the identity

17:06.559 --> 17:07.794
of rape victims.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.362
Oh? Well, tell that
to those people out there.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.764
Hanging around here like we're
some kind of freak show.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.367
Mr. McCain, the quickest way
to get the press away from here

17:14.401 --> 17:15.568
and Tandi back to normal

17:15.602 --> 17:17.237
is if she just
tells us everything.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.305
She already has.

17:18.338 --> 17:19.172
Not quite.

17:19.206 --> 17:21.241
Her fingerprints
are on a food wrapper

17:21.274 --> 17:22.375
in the room
where she was found.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.244
Yeah, so?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.279
Maybe the bastards
fed her.

17:26.313 --> 17:29.282
Apparently, the food
was purchased by Tandi

17:29.316 --> 17:31.284
three blocks away
from Hudson University

17:31.318 --> 17:32.452
on Saturday afternoon.

17:32.485 --> 17:35.255
When, according to Tandi,
she was being held captive.

17:35.288 --> 17:37.557
We also found her prints
on a roll of tape

17:37.590 --> 17:39.126
that she
was tied up with.

17:39.159 --> 17:40.393
What are you saying?
She tied herself up?

17:40.427 --> 17:41.228
We don't know.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.563
That's why we need
to talk to her.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.299
Please, Mr. McCain.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.336
The press are on her side
at the moment.

17:49.369 --> 17:52.472
They find out about this,
they could turn.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.377
I don't know about any food.
I was held prisoner.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.279
We know that,
and nobody's blaming you

17:59.312 --> 18:00.413
for what happened.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.449
We just need to understand
how you managed to escape.

18:02.482 --> 18:04.184
I didn't!

18:04.217 --> 18:05.485
Well, then, how did
the food get in the room?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.487
I told somebody
I was hungry.

18:07.520 --> 18:10.323
And one of them
took me to the store.

18:10.357 --> 18:11.758
Did he
come in with you?

18:11.791 --> 18:14.327
He waited outside.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.496
He said somebody
was gonna watch me,

18:16.529 --> 18:20.233
and if I said anything,
he would kill me.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.535
Tandi, I want you
to take a look at these photos.

18:22.569 --> 18:25.205
Tell me if you
recognize anyone.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.408
They...

18:28.441 --> 18:29.709
They said that they
know where I live,

18:29.742 --> 18:31.144
and they would
come after me.

18:31.178 --> 18:33.446
Tandi, I promise
that they will never

18:33.480 --> 18:34.481
come near you again.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.216
And we will protect you.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.751
But you've got
to help us out, okay?

18:41.888 --> 18:45.558
(Stabler)
Tandi...
look at the photos.

18:48.861 --> 18:51.198
Him.
He's one of the cadets.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.437
What about here

18:57.470 --> 18:58.505
on the second page?

19:01.774 --> 19:03.510
Him.

19:05.245 --> 19:06.513
Are you sure?

19:06.546 --> 19:09.382
They raped me.

19:09.416 --> 19:10.817
Okay.

19:10.850 --> 19:14.287
(Stabler)
How do you know that?

19:14.321 --> 19:16.356
Okay, good enough.
Thanks.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.525
Detective.

19:19.792 --> 19:21.294
What's going on?

19:21.328 --> 19:22.962
My journalist buddy,
trying to make nice with me,

19:22.995 --> 19:27.166
says that channel three news
has something we'll want to see.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.475
(Newsman)
Detectives, this is a videotape
of the party

19:35.508 --> 19:37.744
at Rochester dorm
last Friday night.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.847
Where'd you get this?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.682
Confidential source.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.717
We'll be airing it
on the 11:00 news.

19:44.751 --> 19:45.952
You can't do that.

19:45.985 --> 19:47.387
This girl is a victim
of sexual assault.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.755
Sorry, she's
a public figure now.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.189
And from the looks of this,
not a victim.

19:50.223 --> 19:53.293
(Cragen)
I'm seizing the tape
because it's evidence

19:53.326 --> 19:54.461
in an ongoing inquiry.
It's our property.

19:54.494 --> 19:56.496
I'll get a warrant
to seize it,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.298
and an injunction
to stop you from airing it.

19:58.331 --> 20:01.968
You can't do that.
It's censorship.

20:02.001 --> 20:03.336
I'm protecting
a rape victim.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.271
Stay here.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.607
He does anything
with that tape, arrest him.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.354
New York's Rape Shield Law
protects a victim's identify.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.922
Alleged rape victim,
your honor.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.791
When you play the tape,
you'll see that Tandi McCain

20:24.824 --> 20:26.893
was perfectly aware
that she was being filmed.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.429
She was intoxicated,
therefore, unable to consent.

20:29.462 --> 20:31.664
Also, the tape is evidence
in a criminal investigation.

20:31.698 --> 20:32.899
It should be
given to police,

20:32.932 --> 20:34.467
not broadcast
across the country.

20:34.501 --> 20:36.303
If you're arguing
for prior restraint

20:36.336 --> 20:38.271
of publication,
Ms. Novak,

20:38.305 --> 20:40.773
let me remind you
of the First Amendment.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.775
Was the tape
legally obtained?

20:42.809 --> 20:43.976
Yes, your honor.

20:44.010 --> 20:45.044
And channel three believes

20:45.077 --> 20:46.646
the public has
every right to see it.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.415
That's the same self-serving
spin a network put

20:48.448 --> 20:50.317
on airing
the Andrew Luster tapes.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.851
They claimed that people
had a right to see

20:51.884 --> 20:53.553
a rape victim
being violated.

20:53.586 --> 20:54.954
It's salacious,
not newsworthy.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.956
This video is of genuine
public interest, your honor.

20:56.989 --> 20:59.326
Not least because
it dramatically contradicts

20:59.359 --> 21:00.727
the girl's own statements
to the police.

21:00.760 --> 21:02.962
How do we know the video
was made that night?

21:02.995 --> 21:04.096
What if it's been edited?

21:04.130 --> 21:07.467
We have the only copy.
It has not been edited at all.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.469
And you can prove that?
I'm sorry, Ms. Novak.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.938
But the First Amendment
trumps all.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.507
However, I'd hate
for your station to be sued

21:14.541 --> 21:15.942
because it aired a tape

21:15.975 --> 21:17.944
from the wrong night.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.313
So you'll surrender
to the NYPD for 24 hours

21:20.347 --> 21:22.549
pending authentication, hmm?

21:22.582 --> 21:23.750
Anything else?

21:23.783 --> 21:24.917
We need the name
of the person

21:24.951 --> 21:25.918
who shot the tape,
your honor.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.754
He or she is a material witness
to the events

21:27.787 --> 21:28.888
leading up to the rape.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.090
The source is covered by
journalistic shield, your honor.

21:31.123 --> 21:34.461
You get the tape, Ms. Novak,
not the auteur.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.568
(Man)
Luckily, we got him.

21:41.601 --> 21:44.604
He just doesn't know it.
Watch.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.911
I want you to look
to Tandi's right

21:51.944 --> 21:53.680
as she moves
towards the mirror.

21:55.482 --> 21:56.449
(Benson)
There he is.

21:56.483 --> 21:58.084
Freeze it.

21:59.486 --> 22:00.920
Zoom in.

22:00.953 --> 22:02.021
(Cragen)
Can you clean it up?

22:02.054 --> 22:05.024
Patience.

22:05.057 --> 22:09.629
Just a few more
mouse clicks.

22:09.662 --> 22:11.564
That's Luke Delvecchio.
I interviewed him.

22:11.598 --> 22:13.600
Real bottom feeder.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.435
There's something else
at the end.

22:21.674 --> 22:22.875
See in the background?

22:22.909 --> 22:25.678
Yeah, Tandi's
leaving the room.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.514
Anybody follow her?

22:27.547 --> 22:29.749
Nope.
Tape stops right after that.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.618
So Delvecchio
must have seen her leave.

22:31.651 --> 22:34.654
You and Elliot ask Tandi
about her performance.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.956
Munch and Fin will
bring in the bottom feeder.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.827
Yeah, I shot the tape.
So what?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.462
Why didn't you
tell us before?

22:42.495 --> 22:43.730
Because I wanted
to sell it.

22:43.763 --> 22:45.398
There's nothing
wrong with that.

22:45.432 --> 22:46.699
Tandi McCain is 16,
so we've got you

22:46.733 --> 22:48.735
for promoting the sexual
performance of a child!

22:48.768 --> 22:50.036
What are you
talking about?

22:50.069 --> 22:52.605
That word too big for you--
try child porn.

22:52.639 --> 22:54.474
Seven years in Attica.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.542
You're making this up.

22:55.575 --> 22:57.677
Call your attorney,
ask him.

22:57.710 --> 22:58.945
Or tell us what
you did to Tandi,

22:58.978 --> 23:00.012
and we'll
cut you a deal.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.080
I didn't do anything!

23:01.113 --> 23:02.615
You saw her
leave the party.

23:02.649 --> 23:05.184
Your perv film stops
the moment she walked out.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.753
You followed her,
and you raped her.

23:06.786 --> 23:07.720
I didn't.

23:07.754 --> 23:10.022
She looked sick,
so I asked if she was okay.

23:10.056 --> 23:11.558
She told me
to leave her alone.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.659
And you did?

23:12.692 --> 23:14.494
I went back to the party.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.696
Look, I'm kind of shy
around pretty women, all right?

23:16.729 --> 23:18.431
16-year-olds?

23:18.465 --> 23:19.999
Didn't know she was,
not till she was on the news.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.603
You knew she was missing.
Why not say something?

23:25.538 --> 23:26.873
We could get thrown
out of the cadets

23:26.906 --> 23:28.608
for giving a minor alcohol.

23:28.641 --> 23:30.643
So you kept quiet.
That's courageous.

23:30.677 --> 23:31.944
I know I should have
said something,

23:31.978 --> 23:34.013
but I didn't touch her,
I swear!

23:34.046 --> 23:36.616
If she says different,
she's lying.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.187
My daughter
is telling the truth.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.022
You saw the tape,
Mr. McCain.

23:43.055 --> 23:45.458
Tandi was at that party.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.659
And she was drugged.

23:46.693 --> 23:47.760
She'd never
act like that.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.162
People are gonna believe
what they see on that tape.

23:50.196 --> 23:52.231
I don't even know
how to fight this.

23:52.264 --> 23:54.567
I had to send her
to her aunt's to get her away.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.703
Now she's gonna
get crucified on TV.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.037
Please, Mr. McCain,
listen to us.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.606
You listen to me.

23:59.639 --> 24:01.841
My wife's at home on bed rest
because of the stress.

24:01.874 --> 24:03.543
And you'll do anything
to make an arrest,

24:03.576 --> 24:05.778
even if it means turning
my daughter into a slut.

24:05.812 --> 24:07.480
It doesn't matter
what was on that tape.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.616
It matters
that your daughter was raped.

24:09.649 --> 24:10.783
She doesn't sleep around.

24:10.817 --> 24:11.918
We're not saying that.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.252
Look, Mr. McCain,
I know how scary it is

24:13.285 --> 24:15.154
being the father
to a teenage girl.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.789
Don't you tell me
you know how I feel!

24:16.823 --> 24:18.591
You don't know jack.

24:19.659 --> 24:21.093
You know
the most common reason

24:21.127 --> 24:23.129
women make false
rape allegations?

24:23.162 --> 24:26.599
To explain away
a consensual sexual encounter

24:26.633 --> 24:28.501
when confronted
by a boyfriend or a parent.

24:28.535 --> 24:29.736
You son of a bitch.

24:29.769 --> 24:31.671
You accusing
my daughter of lying?

24:31.704 --> 24:33.272
Hey, Ron.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.207
Is everything
okay here, huh?

24:35.241 --> 24:36.776
Oh, yeah.
Fine.

24:36.809 --> 24:38.678
They're just leaving.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.983
This is crap, Liv.
He's covering for her.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.252
She was raped, Elliot.
He's trying to protect her.

24:46.285 --> 24:47.720
You'd do the same thing.

24:47.754 --> 24:48.621
I would do anything

24:48.655 --> 24:50.256
to find the son of a bitch
who did it.

24:50.289 --> 24:51.558
You know,
let's remember one thing.

24:51.591 --> 24:53.025
That guy is her stepfather.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.894
She's not his kid.
[cell phone rings]

24:54.927 --> 24:56.729
Benson.

24:58.197 --> 25:02.268
It's Cragen.
Crime lab has something.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.571
(Cragen)
Iodine fumes react
with skin secretions

25:04.604 --> 25:06.238
to bring up latent prints.

25:06.272 --> 25:07.907
She just blows
through a tube.

25:07.940 --> 25:10.643
And the heat of my breath
covers the target area

25:10.677 --> 25:12.211
with iodine vapor.

25:12.244 --> 25:14.714
A perfect hand print.

25:14.747 --> 25:16.816
Which is exactly
what we've got here.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.786
Two clear handprints

25:19.819 --> 25:21.788
on the stack
of sheet rock.

25:21.821 --> 25:22.789
(Cragen)
Know who they belong to?

25:22.822 --> 25:24.991
Mm-hmm. We did elimination
prints on the family.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.559
Got a perfect match.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.861
Tandi's stepdad, Ronald.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.833
He has access to her
every day at home,

25:33.866 --> 25:36.068
but he drags her onto
a building site to rape her?

25:36.102 --> 25:38.705
Sure explains why he didn't
want us talking to Tandi.

25:38.738 --> 25:40.673
And why she didn't
want to talk to us.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.142
Let's background him.
See if there's any dirt.

25:44.811 --> 25:45.645
I do construction,
building supply.

25:45.678 --> 25:47.246
You know, anything
that turns a buck.

25:47.279 --> 25:48.681
And Ron McCain's been
with me

25:48.715 --> 25:50.049
ever since he came here
from Nassau county.

25:50.082 --> 25:51.851
I wish all my people
were as loyal.

25:51.884 --> 25:52.785
Any problems?

25:52.819 --> 25:54.654
He had a heart attack
about a year ago,

25:54.687 --> 25:56.322
so I took him off construction,
made him yard foreman.

25:56.355 --> 25:58.190
I meant problems
with his behavior

25:58.224 --> 25:59.258
or with the cops.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.693
Anything like that?

26:00.727 --> 26:02.028
You gonna tell me
what this is all about?

26:02.061 --> 26:03.129
Just a routine inquiry.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.164
Yeah, routine,
my ass.

26:05.197 --> 26:07.166
This is about Tandi,
isn't it?

26:07.199 --> 26:08.868
If you people think
that Ron McCain

26:08.901 --> 26:09.936
had anything
to do with this,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.103
you must be desperate.

26:11.137 --> 26:13.706
He loves that girl
like she was his own.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.074
Tandi's birth father
still around?

26:15.107 --> 26:17.243
Oh, that loser stayed behind
eight years ago,

26:17.276 --> 26:18.377
when they moved here.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.780
Ron have
any trouble at home?

26:20.813 --> 26:22.615
When he first started
dating Alice,

26:22.649 --> 26:24.951
he said that things were
kind of difficult with Tandi.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.052
What kind of difficult?

26:26.085 --> 26:27.720
Ah, there were
some allegations.

26:27.754 --> 26:30.289
But he said it
all settled down.

26:30.322 --> 26:33.059
July, 1995, Nassau County
Police Department.

26:33.092 --> 26:35.327
They had a complaint
of abuse against you.

26:35.361 --> 26:37.730
It's a crap charge
brought by my wife's ex-husband

26:37.764 --> 26:38.865
because he was jealous

26:38.898 --> 26:40.800
that I was dating
Tandi's mom.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.334
It says right there
that the complainant

26:42.368 --> 26:44.370
was Tandi Wetherby,
age seven.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.405
Bastard put her up to it.
Keep reading.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.775
Cops investigated.
Dropped all charges.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.710
Because Tandi withdrew
the allegation.

26:50.743 --> 26:52.712
Yes!
Is that what this is about?

26:52.745 --> 26:54.747
Got tired
of attacking my daughter,

26:54.781 --> 26:56.015
so you're
coming after me.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.850
Were you ever in the room
where Tandi was raped?

26:57.884 --> 26:59.118
No. Why?

26:59.151 --> 27:01.854
Because your handprints
say that you were.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.724
On the sheet rock right next
to where Tandi was found.

27:04.757 --> 27:06.859
We supply sheet rock.

27:06.893 --> 27:09.428
It must have ended up
in that building.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.198
That's quite
a coincidence, Ron.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.966
There have got to be
hundreds of other prints

27:14.000 --> 27:16.035
in that room
besides mine.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.170
We got a better
explanation for you.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.940
Tandi's not a girl anymore.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.775
All grown up,
beautiful woman.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.110
Your wife's pregnant.
Hard not to notice Tandi.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.745
You are sick.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.346
The night she didn't come home,
you went looking for her.

27:27.379 --> 27:28.848
Like I told you!

27:28.881 --> 27:30.950
But you didn't tell us
that you found her.

27:30.983 --> 27:32.819
Now, you saw her
coming out of that party.

27:32.852 --> 27:34.453
You wanted to be mad,
but she was drunk.

27:34.486 --> 27:35.788
Maybe she was flirting
with you a little bit.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.756
Shut up.

27:36.789 --> 27:38.424
So you brought her
to the dorm

27:38.457 --> 27:39.926
and did what you always
wanted to do.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.229
You bastard.
Oh, come on, man.
She is a peach.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.931
You're only
her stepfather.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.933
What's the big deal,
huh?

27:48.434 --> 27:49.902
Uhh!

27:49.936 --> 27:51.237
Ronald McCain,
you are under arrest

27:51.270 --> 27:52.972
for assaulting
a police officer.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.040
You all right?

27:54.073 --> 27:55.942
You have the right
to remain silent.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.810
Anything you say can and will
be used against you

27:57.844 --> 27:58.945
in a court of law.

27:58.978 --> 28:00.012
You have the right
to an attorney.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.247
If you cannot afford one,

28:01.280 --> 28:02.648
one will be
appointed to you.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.283
Do you understand these rights
as I have read them to you?

28:04.316 --> 28:07.319
(Newscaster)
Five more American soldiers
dead in Iraq today.

28:07.353 --> 28:11.390
The bombing continued
in east Baghdad.

28:11.423 --> 28:14.293
McCain was released
on bail.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.429
His boss Mike Tucker
signed the bond.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.398
Nice boss.

28:19.431 --> 28:21.433
I just wish we could have
kept McCain locked up

28:21.467 --> 28:22.969
while we worked
on Tandi.

28:23.002 --> 28:25.271
Hey...

28:25.304 --> 28:27.874
If someone had accused me
of molesting my kid,

28:27.907 --> 28:30.042
I'd want to beat
the crap out of him, too.

28:30.076 --> 28:31.978
What, now you're saying
he didn't do it?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.512
I don't know.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.015
The only I do know is that
we're not running this case.

28:36.048 --> 28:37.483
The media is.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.385
Tandi McCain
was always news, Elliot.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.820
We made her bigger news

28:40.853 --> 28:44.390
the second I talked
to that journalist.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.025
We're trying to catch
the bad guys,

28:46.058 --> 28:47.359
they're trying
to make headlines.

28:47.393 --> 28:48.961
Different agendas.

28:48.995 --> 28:51.330
(newscaster)
Coming up, the truth
about what really happened

28:51.363 --> 28:52.264
in tonight's top story.

28:52.298 --> 28:55.434
Our exclusive interview
with Tandi McCain.

28:55.467 --> 28:57.436
Turn that up, please.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.138
(woman)
You're saying
it didn't happen?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.272
I made it up.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.808
The whole thing?

29:01.841 --> 29:03.042
I stayed out late,

29:03.075 --> 29:04.376
and I was afraid
I would get in trouble,

29:04.410 --> 29:06.813
and everything
got out of control.

29:06.846 --> 29:08.147
What the hell?

29:08.180 --> 29:10.416
I'm so sorry.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.885
What about the two men
you said raped you,

29:12.919 --> 29:15.387
one of whom is still
in the hospital?

29:15.421 --> 29:16.956
Are you sorry
about them too?

29:16.989 --> 29:18.891
I really am.

29:18.925 --> 29:20.326
The police made me name them,

29:20.359 --> 29:23.762
and they
showed me pictures, and--

29:25.097 --> 29:29.836
Because I want it to end.
I want to be left alone.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.470
Do your parents
support you in this?

29:31.503 --> 29:33.072
(Mom)
Yes, we do.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.907
Tandi's been through
so much.

29:34.941 --> 29:36.508
(newscaster)
The Tandi McCain interview...

29:36.542 --> 29:38.510
Oh, that girl sure
knows how to cry.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.546
She's not done
crying yet.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.314
Arrest her.

29:42.348 --> 29:43.549
(newscaster)
What's next for the Giants?

29:43.582 --> 29:44.984
Are you sure?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.986
She obstructed us
every step of the way.

29:47.019 --> 29:48.921
Arrest her.
Captain, how does
that help anything?

29:48.955 --> 29:51.090
It's gonna stop her lies.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.125
Bring her in.

29:53.159 --> 29:54.861
What charge?

29:54.894 --> 29:57.129
Filing a false report.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.137
Where are you taking her,
detectives?

30:05.171 --> 30:06.605
Is she under arrest?

30:06.638 --> 30:09.141
Tandi, have they
arrested you?

30:09.175 --> 30:11.043
What's the charge,
detective?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.411
Is it because
you went on TV?

30:12.444 --> 30:15.147
Tandi, you got
anything to say?

30:15.181 --> 30:16.983
Mr. McCain,
do you have any comments?

30:17.016 --> 30:18.384
Why are they
taking Tandi away?

30:18.417 --> 30:19.952
Are you going down
to the precinct?

30:19.986 --> 30:22.889
Ms. McCain,
why did Tandi lie?

30:26.458 --> 30:28.294
You arrested
a rape victim?

30:28.327 --> 30:30.096
She said
she wasn't raped.

30:30.129 --> 30:32.231
Tandi McCain has done
nothing but lie,

30:32.264 --> 30:33.465
and she nearly got
an innocent kid

30:33.499 --> 30:34.566
killed in the process.

30:34.600 --> 30:35.601
We have to send
a message.

30:35.634 --> 30:37.469
What, by dragging
a teenager out of her home?

30:37.503 --> 30:39.271
Look, Liv,

30:39.305 --> 30:41.607
every false allegation
of rape

30:41.640 --> 30:43.943
just makes it harder for
the real victims to be believed.

30:43.976 --> 30:46.312
Look, the girl obviously
didn't know what she was doing.

30:46.345 --> 30:49.348
She seemed clear enough when
she recanted on national TV.

30:49.381 --> 30:50.917
If she was
telling the truth.

30:50.950 --> 30:53.920
You're convinced
she was raped?

30:53.953 --> 30:54.786
We found spermicide,
remember?

30:54.820 --> 30:56.522
Which could mean
she had consensual sex.

30:56.555 --> 30:57.789
Then why was she
so traumatized

30:57.823 --> 31:01.260
that she hid on a construction
site for two days?

31:01.293 --> 31:03.529
Look, maybe she didn't
tell us the truth,

31:03.562 --> 31:05.898
but I'm not sure that she
told it on TV, either.

31:05.932 --> 31:08.234
And what do you think
the truth is, Olivia?

31:08.267 --> 31:09.668
Her stepdad's been
sitting right next to her.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.137
He put her up to it?

31:11.170 --> 31:12.271
Can you prove that?

31:12.304 --> 31:14.240
Let me talk to her
one more time.

31:14.273 --> 31:15.341
Alone.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.575
Not gonna
get her alone.

31:16.608 --> 31:18.978
Dad's in there with her.

31:19.011 --> 31:22.081
Do you think you
can get him out?

31:25.051 --> 31:26.352
You're right, I'm wrong.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.619
You didn't rape your
stepdaughter.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.421
Now, why should I
believe that?

31:29.455 --> 31:32.091
Tandi says
she wasn't raped.

31:32.124 --> 31:33.993
But then,
if I believe that,

31:34.026 --> 31:37.964
then I've got to believe
she lied about everything else.

31:37.997 --> 31:39.698
She lied about
going to the party.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.699
She lied about being raped.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.434
Now, all of a sudden,
she's telling the truth?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.936
Come on, Ron.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.337
That poor girl
has told so many lies,

31:45.371 --> 31:47.239
she doesn't even know
what the truth is.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.976
Why are you doing this?

31:50.009 --> 31:55.014
To make you
face the truth.

31:55.047 --> 31:55.881
If you've got
nothing to hide,

31:55.914 --> 31:57.950
let us talk
to Tandi alone.

31:57.984 --> 31:59.986
Find out
what really happened.

32:00.019 --> 32:00.919
I'm not gonna put her
through that again.

32:00.953 --> 32:03.389
Because she can't take it
or you can't?

32:06.492 --> 32:08.227
What are you
afraid of, Ron?

32:08.260 --> 32:10.162
She's gonna blow the lid
off your happy family?

32:10.196 --> 32:12.965
It was a happy family.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.266
I made sure of that.

32:14.300 --> 32:16.102
She's already had
one father failure.

32:16.135 --> 32:17.403
I wasn't gonna make it two.

32:17.436 --> 32:20.039
Ron, the only way
you can fail her

32:20.072 --> 32:22.241
is by denying the truth.

32:30.482 --> 32:32.251
What is this place?

32:32.284 --> 32:33.752
Oh, we use it
to talk to children

32:33.785 --> 32:34.953
so that they
feel more at home.

32:34.987 --> 32:37.256
It's a lot more comfortable
than some of those other rooms.

32:37.289 --> 32:39.125
I'm not a child.
I know that.

32:39.158 --> 32:40.492
But you're only 16,

32:40.526 --> 32:42.094
and you've been through
more stuff

32:42.128 --> 32:44.130
than most adults
can handle.

32:44.163 --> 32:45.231
You must feel like

32:45.264 --> 32:46.698
a giant weight was
lifted off you

32:46.732 --> 32:49.135
since you went on TV and said
the rape didn't happen.

32:49.168 --> 32:50.769
It didn't.
I made it up.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.704
A lot of rape victims
say that.

32:52.738 --> 32:54.006
They start
down one road,

32:54.040 --> 32:55.474
and then they realize
how tough it is,

32:55.507 --> 32:57.276
and they back off.

32:57.309 --> 32:59.445
It's easier to say
that you made it all up.

32:59.478 --> 33:02.114
I told you,
nothing happened!

33:02.148 --> 33:03.715
But that's not true,
is it, Tandi?

33:03.749 --> 33:05.784
It is!
Why don't you believe me?!

33:05.817 --> 33:08.320
Because I saw the evidence.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.389
Because I saw the blood.

33:10.422 --> 33:12.724
And the bruises.

33:12.758 --> 33:16.128
You were raped, Tandi.

33:16.162 --> 33:18.097
You've blocked it all out.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.465
But it's gonna come back.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.567
And you have to face it.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.069
I don't want to face it.

33:23.102 --> 33:24.170
I know that you're
protecting somebody

33:24.203 --> 33:26.105
because you love them...

33:26.138 --> 33:27.239
or because
you're afraid of them?

33:27.273 --> 33:28.640
I don't have
to stay here.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.243
Who are you
so scared of, Tandi?
No one!

33:31.277 --> 33:32.344
Is it your stepdad?

33:32.378 --> 33:34.213
Please, just let me go.

33:34.246 --> 33:35.181
I'm not gonna
let him hurt you.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.516
But tell me why
are you so afraid of him?

33:37.549 --> 33:40.352
I'm scared for him!
Why?

33:40.386 --> 33:42.088
Because I don't
want him to die!

33:42.121 --> 33:43.622
If he raped you,
he's not gonna die.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.291
He's gonna go to jail.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.658
He never touched me.

33:46.692 --> 33:48.260
Then who did?

33:50.362 --> 33:53.365
Tandi, please tell me.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.567
Tell me.

33:55.601 --> 33:57.136
I can't.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.271
I can't.

33:59.305 --> 34:01.340
[sobbing]

34:03.309 --> 34:05.444
My dad's got
a bad heart.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.813
And he said
if I said anything,

34:07.846 --> 34:10.482
then my dad
would lose his job...

34:10.516 --> 34:13.652
and his insurance.

34:13.685 --> 34:16.222
My mom is pregnant.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.224
Who said that?

34:18.257 --> 34:19.558
Who said that?

34:19.591 --> 34:23.262
It would just
kill him.

34:23.295 --> 34:25.564
I don't believe it.

34:27.433 --> 34:29.401
You know?

34:30.736 --> 34:34.106
Mike Tucker, my boss.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.575
My friend.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.814
Tandi accused me of rape?

34:42.848 --> 34:44.350
(Stabler)
Multiple rapes.

34:44.383 --> 34:46.385
Where am I supposed
to have done this?

34:46.418 --> 34:48.254
In the dorm rooms
that your company's building

34:48.287 --> 34:50.422
for Hudson University
last Friday night.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.158
I wasn't near Hudson
on Friday.

34:52.191 --> 34:53.024
(Stabler)
First lie.

34:53.058 --> 34:54.393
You called
campus security

34:54.426 --> 34:55.661
to close down
the cadet party.

34:55.694 --> 34:57.363
How would I know
about a party?

34:57.396 --> 34:58.464
Oh, second lie--
campus cops said

34:58.497 --> 35:00.332
that you were working late
in your on-site office.

35:00.366 --> 35:02.734
Now, before you go
for the hat trick,

35:02.768 --> 35:05.404
I want you to think
how easy it'll be for us

35:05.437 --> 35:07.473
to check
your phone records.

35:07.506 --> 35:10.409
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.644
I did call security.

35:12.678 --> 35:13.912
We have a lot of trouble

35:13.945 --> 35:15.414
with the students
breaking into the site.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.216
Were you worried
that they were gonna

35:17.249 --> 35:18.350
interrupt you
raping Tandi?

35:18.384 --> 35:20.186
I've known Tandi
since she was eight.

35:20.219 --> 35:22.354
I watched
that girl grow up.

35:22.388 --> 35:25.357
I supported her family
when her dad was sick.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.559
I've loved her
like a daughter.

35:27.593 --> 35:31.763
And to suggest
that I might harm her...

35:31.797 --> 35:33.399
well,
that's disgusting!

35:33.432 --> 35:35.634
I'm touched,
but you still raped her

35:35.667 --> 35:37.303
and then threatened
to destroy her family

35:37.336 --> 35:38.837
if she told anyone.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.472
Tandi said that
about me?

35:40.506 --> 35:42.241
I don't believe you.
Why not?

35:42.274 --> 35:43.375
She's terrified of you.

35:43.409 --> 35:44.676
She's terrified of you.

35:44.710 --> 35:46.545
I see what you're
doing here.

35:46.578 --> 35:48.347
First, you go after
the cadets.

35:48.380 --> 35:49.648
Then the father.
Now it's my turn.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.717
You people are so desperate
to close this case,

35:51.750 --> 35:53.285
you'll put the screws
to anyone.

35:53.319 --> 35:54.720
Who's next--
her mother?

35:58.424 --> 36:00.326
Not gonna sugar coat
this, Tandi.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.828
The defense is gonna
chop you to pieces on the stand.

36:02.861 --> 36:04.963
They're gonna drag up
every lie you told,

36:04.996 --> 36:06.865
every change of story.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.501
It's gonna be
a tough trial.

36:09.535 --> 36:11.503
What should I do?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.405
I don't know,
sweetheart.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.443
What would you do?

36:17.476 --> 36:21.213
I think that has to be
Tandi's decision.

36:21.247 --> 36:22.814
But I've known
many rape victims

36:22.848 --> 36:24.983
who've regretted
not going to court.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.419
And I've never met one
who's regretted it.

36:27.453 --> 36:30.256
Win or lose?

36:30.289 --> 36:31.590
Yeah.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.460
Even if you do lose,

36:34.493 --> 36:36.262
you've already
faced your attacker

36:36.295 --> 36:38.397
and named him
for what he is.

36:45.737 --> 36:47.406
(Novak)
Why did you lie
to the police

36:47.439 --> 36:48.840
about being
at the party?

36:48.874 --> 36:51.910
Because I knew it would
upset my mom and dad.

36:51.943 --> 36:54.346
Did you falsely identify
Joseph Eglee

36:54.380 --> 36:57.416
and James O'Connor
as your attackers?

36:57.449 --> 36:59.985
Yes.

37:00.018 --> 37:01.620
Though you knew
they were innocent.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.489
Yes.

37:03.522 --> 37:05.457
Why?

37:05.491 --> 37:08.427
I was exhausted.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.529
And the press were
outside our house all the time.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.931
I hadn't slept
in two days.

37:12.964 --> 37:16.402
The police
showed me photos.

37:16.435 --> 37:19.338
And I hoped that if
I named someone,

37:19.371 --> 37:22.341
it would all just stop.

37:22.374 --> 37:24.510
I did a terrible thing.

37:27.413 --> 37:29.581
I'm sorry.

37:30.982 --> 37:32.884
What did happen that night?

37:32.918 --> 37:35.020
I left the party

37:35.053 --> 37:37.323
because I was
feeling sick.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.858
And I was walking
outside, and...

37:39.891 --> 37:43.028
I met Mr. Tucker.

37:43.061 --> 37:45.431
What did he do?

37:45.464 --> 37:46.898
He was angry with me

37:46.932 --> 37:49.401
because I stayed out
so late.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.903
And he told me
that he would show me a place

37:51.937 --> 37:56.975
where I could get cleaned up
before I went home.

37:57.008 --> 37:58.910
And...

37:58.944 --> 38:00.412
then he took me

38:00.446 --> 38:02.548
onto the construction site.

38:02.581 --> 38:04.850
To the unfinished room.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.985
I thought
he was a still angry.

38:07.018 --> 38:10.389
But then he told me...

38:10.422 --> 38:15.461
how sexy I looked.

38:15.494 --> 38:18.564
And how much
I had grown up.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.031
And then he kissed me.

38:22.768 --> 38:27.773
And he brought his hand
up my skirt.

38:27.806 --> 38:30.842
I--I begged him to stop,

38:30.876 --> 38:33.945
and...he held me down,

38:33.979 --> 38:35.914
and...

38:35.947 --> 38:37.516
he told me

38:37.549 --> 38:40.986
that I wanted it.

38:41.019 --> 38:43.655
And then he raped me.

38:43.689 --> 38:45.056
What happened next?

38:51.029 --> 38:53.365
He told me...

38:53.399 --> 38:56.067
if I told anyone,
he would fire my dad.

38:56.101 --> 38:58.804
And that the stress
would kill him.

38:58.837 --> 39:01.907
Then he left?

39:01.940 --> 39:03.809
No.

39:03.842 --> 39:07.012
He raped me again.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.614
And then he gave me $20

39:08.647 --> 39:12.083
to take a taxi.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.520
I didn't know
what to do.

39:14.553 --> 39:18.990
So for two whole days,
you hid.

39:19.024 --> 39:21.660
I was so ashamed.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.529
I just wanted
to crawl into a hole

39:23.562 --> 39:27.533
and never come out.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.735
Thank you.

39:34.105 --> 39:36.074
No questions,
your honor.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.444
The young lady changes her story
every two minutes,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.145
who who knows
what version we'd get here?

39:40.178 --> 39:41.980
Your honor--

39:42.013 --> 39:43.114
Behave, Mr. Kressler.

39:43.148 --> 39:45.417
Any more witnesses,
Ms. Novak?

39:45.451 --> 39:48.119
The people rest.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.921
We would like to recall
Detective Stabler

39:49.955 --> 39:51.457
as our first witness,
your honor.

39:56.595 --> 39:59.164
What is a false
rape allegation?

39:59.197 --> 40:01.099
It's an unfounded
accusation of rape.

40:01.132 --> 40:04.102
What is
the most common type?

40:04.135 --> 40:08.173
When a woman uses rape
to explain away

40:08.206 --> 40:09.875
a consensual
sexual encounter.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.610
You see a lot of that
in your work?

40:11.643 --> 40:13.144
Not a lot.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.646
Well, according to the FBI

40:14.680 --> 40:17.983
crime statistics,
nearly 10% of all rapes

40:18.016 --> 40:20.085
turn out to be false
allegations.

40:20.118 --> 40:23.054
Some sources
put it even higher than that.

40:23.088 --> 40:24.556
Is there
a question here?

40:24.590 --> 40:27.192
Yes.

40:27.225 --> 40:30.028
Did you at any time
believe that Tandi was lying?

40:30.061 --> 40:31.830
Yes.

40:31.863 --> 40:33.231
She lied about
being tied up.

40:33.264 --> 40:36.134
She lied about the cadets.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.003
She even snuck out
to a store by herself

40:38.036 --> 40:39.204
to buy food,

40:39.237 --> 40:40.706
and then she went on TV

40:40.739 --> 40:42.508
and admitted she was lying.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.643
She recanted.
She was terrified.

40:44.676 --> 40:46.678
Really?
You arrested her.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.180
For filing a false report.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.549
And after you arrested her,

40:50.582 --> 40:52.551
didn't she try to change
her story again?

40:52.584 --> 40:53.852
She told us the truth.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.621
You mean she told you
what you wanted to hear.

40:55.654 --> 40:57.889
No, she said--
Come on.

40:57.923 --> 40:59.658
With all the publicity
around this case,

40:59.691 --> 41:01.092
you had to get a result.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.061
Even if it meant
accusing an innocent man.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.195
Your honor--

41:04.229 --> 41:06.097
Nothing further.

41:14.172 --> 41:15.173
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

41:15.206 --> 41:16.174
have you reached
a verdict?

41:16.207 --> 41:19.077
We have, your honor.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.146
On the charge of rape
in the first degree,

41:21.179 --> 41:23.114
how do you find?

41:23.148 --> 41:26.117
We find the defendant
not guilty.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.587
[murmuring]

41:33.224 --> 41:34.726
Mr. Tucker,
you're free to go.

41:34.760 --> 41:35.927
[bangs gavel]

41:35.961 --> 41:37.028
Court is adjourned.

41:48.807 --> 41:50.776
Tandi, over here!
Tandi, how do you
feel about the verdict?

41:50.809 --> 41:52.177
Do you think
it was fair?

41:52.210 --> 41:54.012
Are you sorry
you went to court?

41:54.045 --> 41:55.781
I'm just sorry I didn't win,
that's all.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.182
What do you do next,
Tandi?

41:57.215 --> 41:59.951
I'm gonna go to school
and get on with my life.

41:59.985 --> 42:00.819
All right, that's all.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.988
It's Tucker!
Mr. Tucker!

42:07.125 --> 42:08.760
I'm sorry, Tandi.

42:08.794 --> 42:11.162
Don't be.

42:11.196 --> 42:13.599
You were right.

42:13.632 --> 42:15.734
I don't regret it.

42:24.275 --> 42:25.611
Thank you.

42:25.644 --> 42:26.878
For what?

42:26.912 --> 42:28.079
For not being afraid.

42:30.649 --> 42:31.650
Detective Stabler.

42:31.683 --> 42:33.184
Yes?

42:33.218 --> 42:35.253
My name is Alison Luhan.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.822
And I want to report a rape.

42:39.257 --> 42:40.992
When did it happen?

42:41.026 --> 42:43.094
Six months ago.

42:43.128 --> 42:45.363
Do you know who raped you?

42:45.396 --> 42:47.065
Yes.

42:48.199 --> 42:49.935
Mike Tucker.

42:49.968 --> 42:53.639
Mr. Tucker, do you feel
vindicated by the verdict?

42:53.672 --> 42:55.040
What are your feelings
toward Tandi McCain?

42:55.073 --> 42:56.608
Were you angry?

42:56.642 --> 42:58.043
Do you blame Tandi?

42:58.076 --> 43:00.846
Well, I do feel vindicated
by the verdict.

43:00.879 --> 43:04.082
And, no, I do not blame
Tandi, not at all.
