See you tomorrow, Mabel.

00:06.140 --> 00:08.940
And no chasing after Mr Roberts tonight.

00:11.220 --> 00:14.370
All right, love? No need to pick
me up in the morning, I'll walk.

00:14.420 --> 00:17.210
- Casserole's in the oven.
- Oh, ta. I might go out with Nick later.

00:17.260 --> 00:20.620
- Just so long as he doesn't stay over.
- What do you take me for, Mum?

00:22.300 --> 00:23.970
See you later.

Great. Thanks.

Me and Mick are doing a turn,
really pushing the boat out.

02:26.340 --> 02:29.540
- Jane? Davey -- says it's urgent.
- Right. Sorry.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.100
Davey.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.860
Lone driver. Judging by the sand
in the car, she'd been to the beach.

02:40.220 --> 02:41.770
She looks so young.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.340
Yeah. 17.

02:45.340 --> 02:47.810
Ellie Patterson. Debs' daughter.

02:49.460 --> 02:51.460
Cath's sister, Debbie?

02:52.460 --> 02:54.890
I'm on my way to see Debs now.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.770
Can't get hold of Dean.

02:56.820 --> 02:58.090
Dean?

02:58.140 --> 03:01.370
Lowe. Cath's husband. Remember
him? Year above us at school?

03:01.420 --> 03:03.090
Yeah, 'course.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.500
Poor Debbie.

03:11.540 --> 03:13.330
Would you mind if I go and see Cath?

03:13.380 --> 03:16.770
No. Not the best way to meet
up after 20-odd years, is it?

03:16.820 --> 03:19.290
I think she could do with
a friendly face right now.

03:19.340 --> 03:22.540
- Got her address?
- Yeah, I'll find it for you.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.570
- Davey.
- You all right, Debbie, love?

03:37.620 --> 03:40.450
I've just finished at
Oaklands. Ellie not in?

03:40.500 --> 03:42.380
Can we go inside?

04:08.220 --> 04:10.890
Cath? Jane. Jane Kennedy.

04:10.940 --> 04:12.850
Sorry, it's just not a
good time right now.

04:12.900 --> 04:14.890
I just, er... I've got to, er...

04:14.940 --> 04:18.060
You've already heard. About Ellie.

04:20.380 --> 04:23.580
You're the coroner. Yeah, Dean phoned.

04:25.060 --> 04:28.490
He, er... he was on duty
in Plymouth when he...

04:28.540 --> 04:31.540
- You know, when they, um...
- I'm so sorry.

04:33.100 --> 04:36.530
DS Hig... Davey, he... he's
on his way to see Debs now.

04:36.580 --> 04:38.930
Dean's on his way home from work now.

04:38.980 --> 04:41.370
He's going to take me and Alex over.

04:41.420 --> 04:46.530
Alex, he's my son.
He's... he's devastated!

04:46.580 --> 04:50.090
Look, I... I can take
you both, if you like?

04:50.140 --> 04:53.290
No, Dean will take him. Alex?

04:53.340 --> 04:55.210
I'm going over to see Auntie Debs.

04:55.260 --> 04:58.260
Your dad will take you
when he gets home, OK?

04:59.660 --> 05:02.860
Oh, Jane, I can't believe
it! I can't believe it!

05:04.100 --> 05:07.130
So, I think if we keep half for
tonight, the other half for Reading?

05:07.180 --> 05:09.650
Advance planning. I like it.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.850
Oooh, found some wine.

05:11.900 --> 05:14.170
A cheeky little rosé. Nice!

05:14.220 --> 05:15.570
You sure they won't notice?

05:15.620 --> 05:17.930
Nah. Anyway, Gran wouldn't mind.

05:17.980 --> 05:19.450
That's nice of me.

05:19.500 --> 05:22.650
Not sure your mum would
feel the same, mind.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.330
Or yours, Megan.

05:24.380 --> 05:28.900
- I thought you were out.
- I figured. I forgot this, for tonight.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.420
Schnapps?

05:33.380 --> 05:34.770
Beth, not even I'd drink that.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.820
Please don't tell Mum!

05:38.060 --> 05:39.530
I tell you what,

05:39.580 --> 05:43.850
you hand all these out
and we'll talk about it.

05:43.900 --> 05:46.890
But I'm going to a sleepover at Megan's.

05:46.940 --> 05:48.620
OK, OK.

05:51.540 --> 05:56.370
Hand all those out and you
can pick this up later.

05:56.420 --> 05:58.220
Gran won't mind(!)

06:05.260 --> 06:07.140
Debs.

06:10.460 --> 06:12.060
I'm so sorry!

06:16.140 --> 06:18.650
Jane, thanks for bringing Cath over.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.730
I'm so sorry about Ellie. If
there's anything I can do to help...

06:21.780 --> 06:24.210
Right. Uh, the Collision
Investigation Unit's

06:24.260 --> 06:26.130
finished doing their thing now, so...

06:26.180 --> 06:28.970
- What did they find?
- Do they know what happened?

06:29.020 --> 06:31.370
They think she might have
been driving a bit fast,

06:31.420 --> 06:34.020
came to a sharp bend, lost control.

06:36.620 --> 06:39.170
You OK?

06:39.220 --> 06:42.020
Ellie never speeded. She's too sensible.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.690
No sign of anyone else?

06:44.740 --> 06:46.690
No, no, not that we can see.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.330
We checked her mobile phone.

06:48.380 --> 06:51.050
Last call was to Debs at 6pm,

06:51.100 --> 06:53.970
and there's a couple of texts
a few days ago, to a Nick.

06:54.020 --> 06:55.770
Her boyfriend -- Nick Caldwell.

06:55.820 --> 06:57.810
Ellie said she might be
seeing him last night.

06:57.860 --> 06:59.730
Any relation to Stuart Caldwell?

06:59.780 --> 07:01.410
Mm. His son.

07:01.460 --> 07:03.170
Can't say I approved.

07:03.220 --> 07:05.930
We all know what you thought of
him. You made that very clear.

07:05.980 --> 07:08.050
You don't even know him.

07:10.940 --> 07:13.140
Can I see my daughter now?

07:14.500 --> 07:15.820
Yeah.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.820
She looks... peaceful.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.280
Like she's sleeping.

07:43.140 --> 07:44.770
We should go outside.

07:44.820 --> 07:46.090
Why?

07:46.140 --> 07:48.970
Er... I've got the postmortem results.

07:49.020 --> 07:51.760
Well, why can't we talk about it here?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.810
Well, don't look at her.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.250
I'm Ellie's mother.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.970
Did she suffer?

08:01.300 --> 08:03.570
Ellie died from chest injuries.

08:03.620 --> 08:05.650
But given the level of
alcohol in her blood,

08:05.700 --> 08:07.570
she wouldn't have known much about it.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.410
She was driving drunk?

08:09.460 --> 08:12.490
No, the bruising ran from her
left shoulder to her right hip.

08:12.540 --> 08:14.940
- So?
- Ellie was a passenger.

08:15.980 --> 08:18.120
Someone else was driving.

08:25.700 --> 08:28.770
Done it -- handed out 260 fliers.

08:28.820 --> 08:30.090
Tonight's cancelled.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.690
We've just been all over Lighthaven.

08:31.740 --> 08:34.610
Out of respect. Our old
barmaid's daughter died.

08:34.659 --> 08:36.450
Only two years older than you.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.570
She used to come here as a little 'un,

08:38.620 --> 08:40.330
run around in her nappy.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.740
Ran around once without
it -- made a right mess.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.500
- Who was she?
- Ellie Patterson.

08:50.180 --> 08:51.370
What happened?

08:51.420 --> 08:54.410
Car accident. Did you know her?

08:54.460 --> 08:55.930
No, not really.

08:55.980 --> 08:58.490
I'm just going to take
this and leave you to it.

08:58.540 --> 09:00.880
There's been a change of plan.

09:01.580 --> 09:03.130
Oh! Hi, Mum, this is Megan.

09:03.180 --> 09:05.570
Gran told me you've got half
an off-licence in your bag.

09:05.620 --> 09:08.210
- She's exaggerating.
- Really? You can go.

09:08.260 --> 09:10.050
- Cheers. Come on, Beth.
- No, not you.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.090
- That's not fair!
- I'll tell you what's not fair.

09:12.140 --> 09:14.650
I've just been with a dead
17-year-old, so you're not going,

09:14.700 --> 09:17.410
and certainly not with someone who
encourages you to steal alcohol!

09:17.460 --> 09:19.050
- Excuse me?
- You heard.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.410
- Whatever, suit yourself. See you later.
- No, she won't.

09:22.460 --> 09:24.130
That is so out of order!

09:24.180 --> 09:26.410
The drinks were my idea, if you must know!

09:26.460 --> 09:29.030
Megan's my best mate, what
am I supposed to do now?

09:29.080 --> 09:30.290
I'll find you something.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.170
Oh, yeah, like, cleaning
the toilets, again!

09:32.220 --> 09:33.690
I have to take this. Clint.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.530
Cos last time I checked, unpaid
work is called slave labour.

09:36.580 --> 09:39.810
No, it's called reimbursement
for all the booze you've nicked.

09:39.860 --> 09:42.050
- Where is he now?
- I didn't nick anything.

09:42.100 --> 09:45.650
- Only because I stopped you.
- I handed out all of your fliers.

09:45.700 --> 09:49.010
- Look, Mum...
- Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can.

09:49.060 --> 09:51.010
Don't let her out of your sight.

09:51.060 --> 09:53.530
What...? Go on, then, ignore me!

09:56.460 --> 09:58.860
Oi! Where are you going, missy?

10:02.660 --> 10:05.260
Fine, but I'm not doing the bogs.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.970
We should talk to a funeral director.

10:12.020 --> 10:14.970
Maybe Ethel Blackstone,
who did your mum's?

10:15.020 --> 10:16.960
I'll give her a ring.

10:21.300 --> 10:24.250
- Stop the car! Stop!
- What?!

10:24.300 --> 10:26.020
Pull over!

10:33.780 --> 10:35.100
Debs!

10:36.380 --> 10:37.780
Debs?

10:44.620 --> 10:47.220
- What did you do?! - What? - Debs!

10:49.300 --> 10:50.570
Ellie's dead.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.610
- Don't be stupid.
- Hey!

10:52.660 --> 10:56.210
I've just seen her lying in the
mortuary. You think it's funny?

10:56.260 --> 10:58.130
- Debs, leave him.
- What's she talking about?

10:58.180 --> 11:01.540
Ellie died this morning. Car crash.
Only she wasn't the one driving.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.570
- What?
- What did you do?!

11:04.620 --> 11:07.010
It wasn't me! I'd never hurt her, I swear!

11:07.060 --> 11:08.800
What's going on?

11:10.580 --> 11:12.410
Dean?

11:12.460 --> 11:14.450
Is it true? Ellie wasn't on her own?

11:14.500 --> 11:16.570
You can't take the law
into your own hands.

11:16.620 --> 11:18.660
Even you. I got this.

11:20.340 --> 11:23.300
Take Debs home, will you? Look after her.

11:30.220 --> 11:32.360
This isn't the way, love.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.730
DS Davey Higgins, South Dart Police.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.530
I'm guessing you're Nick Caldwell?

11:42.580 --> 11:45.050
- What happened?
- You tell me.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.810
I haven't seen Ellie for a week.

11:47.860 --> 11:50.930
That's funny, cos Debs said she
may have been with you last night.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.320
I was at my aunt's in Torquay.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.970
She dropped me back this morning.

11:56.020 --> 12:00.050
All right. You got any idea
who Ellie might've been with?

12:00.100 --> 12:01.290
Not a clue.

12:01.340 --> 12:05.020
- I wouldn't have put you and
Ellie together. - Meaning?

12:06.060 --> 12:08.210
No reason. How's your dad?

12:08.260 --> 12:11.050
- Are we finished?
- No, I don't think so.

12:11.100 --> 12:13.810
I think we'll continue this down
the station, check out this alibi.

12:13.860 --> 12:17.300
- Might be good to get your prints,
as well. - What for? - Elimination.

12:18.540 --> 12:20.810
Haven't got a problem with that, have you?

12:20.860 --> 12:22.220
Come on.

12:31.140 --> 12:33.010
I'm really sorry. It's just...

12:33.060 --> 12:34.970
you said if you could
do anything to help...

12:35.020 --> 12:36.570
Sure. What's wrong?

12:36.620 --> 12:39.020
Mum said Ellie wasn't alone.

12:40.860 --> 12:42.850
I talked to Ellie a couple of weeks ago.

12:42.900 --> 12:46.540
She said her boyfriend
was... too controlling.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.570
Didn't like her seeing anyone else.

12:49.620 --> 12:51.490
She told me not to tell her mum, but...

12:51.540 --> 12:53.690
only now this has happened,
I just feel a bit...

12:53.740 --> 12:55.300
Guilty?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.810
She might not have meant it.

12:59.860 --> 13:02.170
It could've just been a row or something.

13:02.220 --> 13:05.010
I-I-I-I don't want to
get him into trouble,

13:05.060 --> 13:07.780
I just... had to tell someone.

13:10.140 --> 13:12.280
What did you make of him?

13:13.340 --> 13:15.570
I don't really know him.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.730
Met him a couple of times when
they started going out together.

13:18.780 --> 13:20.770
How long were they together?

13:20.820 --> 13:22.330
Six months.

13:22.380 --> 13:24.380
Serious?

13:26.500 --> 13:28.410
Were you and Ellie close?

13:28.460 --> 13:30.740
Used to be, before Nick.

13:32.780 --> 13:35.010
I helped her with her GCSEs.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.970
I do tutoring. University fund.

13:37.020 --> 13:39.420
Ah! Which uni are you going to?

13:40.260 --> 13:41.850
King's at Cambridge.

13:41.900 --> 13:43.610
King's? Wow!

13:43.660 --> 13:46.860
That's fantastic. No
wonder your mum's proud.

13:49.380 --> 13:51.320
I couldn't care less.

13:52.700 --> 13:55.290
I'd give it up in a
second to have Ellie back.

13:55.340 --> 13:57.140
What was she like?

13:59.620 --> 14:01.690
She was great.

14:01.740 --> 14:03.730
Bright, clever...

14:03.780 --> 14:05.300
so funny.

14:07.700 --> 14:09.650
She'd had it tough, though.

14:09.700 --> 14:11.890
Her dad died a couple of years ago.

14:11.940 --> 14:14.280
She had to work, help her mum.

14:15.340 --> 14:17.680
She couldn't wait to leave...

14:19.460 --> 14:21.530
.. before she met Nick.

14:24.380 --> 14:26.650
- Jane? - Yeah. - Forensic PM just in.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.690
Sorry, mate, it's just
that Davey needs them.

14:28.740 --> 14:33.640
- I can scan them in, if you want?
- No, no, no, I'll take them. Thank you.

14:35.260 --> 14:37.210
Sorry, I'd better go.

14:37.260 --> 14:39.600
Don't be so hard on yourself.

14:42.860 --> 14:44.970
This is a waste of time,

14:45.020 --> 14:47.560
you're not going to find anything.

14:54.300 --> 14:56.290
Right, Nick, your aunt's
confirmed your alibi.

14:56.340 --> 14:58.410
Told you. Can I go?

14:58.460 --> 15:02.180
Yeah, as long as you don't leave
Lighthaven. Take him out, please.

15:05.300 --> 15:07.500
Is that Ellie's boyfriend?

15:07.900 --> 15:09.530
Alex came to see me,

15:09.580 --> 15:11.810
said it wasn't a bed of
roses between those two.

15:11.860 --> 15:14.090
Well, I wouldn't trust him
as far as I could throw him.

15:14.140 --> 15:16.090
Never trust an alibi
given by a family member,

15:16.140 --> 15:18.210
especially when it's a Caldwell.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.770
- Look, I've got some bad
news for you. - What?

15:20.820 --> 15:23.610
Ellie's car, driver's side?
Completely wiped of prints.

15:23.660 --> 15:25.610
Door handles, steering wheel, gear leaver.

15:25.660 --> 15:27.730
Someone's been watching too much CSI.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.930
We'll try and get some DNA,
but I think it's doubtful.

15:30.980 --> 15:32.610
Look at the Forensic PM.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.370
Ellie's ribs broke in the accident.

15:35.420 --> 15:38.010
If she'd stayed in the car,
she might have survived,

15:38.060 --> 15:40.650
but bruising on her arms
indicate she was pulled out.

15:40.700 --> 15:42.690
When she was moved, her
ribs punctured her skin,

15:42.740 --> 15:44.810
causing a tension pneumothorax.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.650
Her right lung collapsed,

15:46.700 --> 15:48.770
that's what killed her.

15:58.620 --> 16:00.530
Did you know her?

16:00.580 --> 16:01.980
No.

16:12.140 --> 16:14.610
Whoever moved her good as murdered her.

16:14.660 --> 16:16.800
I don't know what to say.

16:18.100 --> 16:19.610
Well, Nick's got an alibi.

16:19.660 --> 16:21.250
He said he hadn't seen Ellie in a week.

16:21.300 --> 16:24.770
He's lying! She said she
was seeing him that night!

16:24.820 --> 16:27.210
All right. Well, we'll
check the local hospitals,

16:27.260 --> 16:30.210
see if anyone was admitted
on the morning Ellie died.

16:30.260 --> 16:32.450
Sarge! Up here.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.100
Excuse me.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.330
Anything from the boyfriend?

16:39.380 --> 16:41.370
- Any letters or cards or anything?
- No, nothing.

16:41.420 --> 16:43.620
- That's it, yeah?
- Yeah.

16:44.460 --> 16:46.930
They found this phone-charger
in Ellie's room,

16:46.980 --> 16:49.650
only it doesn't match her phone.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.690
- Could it be yours?
- That's not mine.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.890
Could she have had another phone?

16:53.940 --> 16:55.380
No.

16:59.300 --> 17:02.370
I know it seems boring after London.
You have to make your own fun.

17:02.420 --> 17:04.970
- Yeah, I was.
- So... Ta-da!

17:05.020 --> 17:06.970
Clint's volunteered to teach you to surf.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.849
I think volunteered's a bit strong.

17:08.900 --> 17:12.050
I thought you'd taken the day off
to, like, actually be with me.

17:12.099 --> 17:13.690
I know, I'm sorry. I've got to work,

17:13.740 --> 17:16.290
but I'm going to come
and pick you up later.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.480
He says the surf's great!

17:21.660 --> 17:25.690
- Actually, um... yeah, it's...
it's perfect! - Really?

17:25.740 --> 17:29.040
Yeah. I mean, I've always
wanted to learn to surf.

17:30.940 --> 17:32.460
Great. Hm!

17:33.540 --> 17:35.170
What's that?

17:35.220 --> 17:38.290
Oh, it's just from a club
in Plymouth -- Deja Vu.

17:38.340 --> 17:41.170
I went there last night. It's
a bit stubborn, actually.

17:41.220 --> 17:44.330
Do you know any clubs called Tutankhamen,

17:44.380 --> 17:46.650
- or anything to do with Egypt?
- No.

17:46.700 --> 17:48.450
Bit old for clubbing, aren't you, Mum?

17:48.500 --> 17:49.900
Have fun.

17:51.260 --> 17:55.450
So, we learn to surf on sand
before we go on the water.

17:55.500 --> 17:58.290
Once you've mastered it here,
then we can go out there.

17:58.340 --> 18:00.530
First things first, we want to figure out

18:00.580 --> 18:03.580
- our body position on
the board, OK? - Yeah.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.330
So, we make sure our toes are together

18:07.380 --> 18:09.290
and at the back of the board, like this.

18:09.340 --> 18:11.250
- We call this the sweet spot.
- Yeah.

18:11.300 --> 18:12.810
Beth!

18:12.860 --> 18:14.340
Yeah?

18:17.660 --> 18:20.290
Oh. You can get up.
Look, I'm shooting off.

18:20.340 --> 18:21.890
Back in, what, four hours?

18:21.940 --> 18:23.890
What?! Your mum said that we...

18:23.940 --> 18:26.570
We'll let her think you
taught me, obviously.

18:26.620 --> 18:29.330
- No, no, she's given me the
whole day off. - Brilliant.

18:29.380 --> 18:30.890
Look at that, it's perfect!

18:30.940 --> 18:32.610
Why would you want to be teaching me

18:32.660 --> 18:34.450
when you could be out there, surfing?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.850
Oh, man! She's going to kill me!

18:36.900 --> 18:38.580
She won't know.

18:39.860 --> 18:42.490
All right. We meet back here at 3pm

18:42.540 --> 18:45.690
and if Jane asks, I taught you pop-ups.

18:45.740 --> 18:49.020
- Google it -- pop-ups!
- Pop-ups!

18:54.740 --> 18:56.660
Megan? We're on.

18:57.700 --> 19:01.210
Davey, it's me. I don't
think Nick was with his aunt.

19:01.260 --> 19:04.140
No. You want to know where he really was?

19:05.340 --> 19:07.280
There you are, mate.

19:11.620 --> 19:13.210
Hey, Nick,

19:13.260 --> 19:15.290
can you step down from the van, please?

19:15.340 --> 19:18.940
- I need to have a word with you.
- This is harassment!

19:22.500 --> 19:25.130
- Why didn't you say you
were at Pharaoh's? - What?

19:25.180 --> 19:27.330
You had a stamp on your hand.

19:27.380 --> 19:29.010
I saw it at the police station.

19:29.060 --> 19:30.850
We know what kind of
club night it is, Nick,

19:30.900 --> 19:32.650
and we know it only
happens once a month --

19:32.700 --> 19:33.850
the night that Ellie died.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.090
Don't tell my dad. He'd kill me.

19:36.140 --> 19:37.530
I'm not going to tell your dad.

19:37.580 --> 19:39.320
I don't need to.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.090
So let's start again, shall we?

19:42.140 --> 19:45.530
Were you at Pharaoh's the
night that Ellie died?

19:45.580 --> 19:47.380
There till five...

19:48.260 --> 19:50.730
.. till it closed, and
hitched back in the morning.

19:50.780 --> 19:52.810
Did Ellie know you were gay?

19:52.860 --> 19:55.170
She was the only one
around here that guessed.

19:55.220 --> 19:56.530
She said she'd be my beard,

19:56.580 --> 19:58.770
you know, make it look
like I was straight.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.620
- Why?
- She wanted a cover story, too.

20:02.740 --> 20:04.490
She was seeing someone.

20:04.540 --> 20:07.340
- Who? - I don't know, she wouldn't say.

20:08.860 --> 20:11.050
So, how do I know you're
not making this up?

20:11.100 --> 20:13.260
Check Pharaoh's CCTV.

20:14.340 --> 20:16.810
I wasn't with Ellie, I was there.

20:18.420 --> 20:20.130
Another boyfriend?

20:20.180 --> 20:22.810
Could be why she had another mobile phone.

20:22.860 --> 20:25.460
I'm not ruling Nick out yet, though.

20:26.020 --> 20:29.020
- You sure she never mentioned
anyone else to you? - No-one.

20:30.180 --> 20:33.570
All right. Well, we got nothing from
her room, apart from the charger,

20:33.620 --> 20:36.290
and there's no news back
from the hospitals, so...

20:36.340 --> 20:39.450
I really need to step this
investigation up now, Debbie.

20:39.500 --> 20:41.770
I'm going to need your help.

20:43.220 --> 20:44.650
Ellie Patterson was last seen

20:44.700 --> 20:46.810
leaving Oakland's Care Home in Lighthaven

20:46.860 --> 20:48.570
at 6pm on Thursday evening.

20:48.620 --> 20:51.970
We believe she then spent the
rest of that night in Blaze Sands.

20:52.020 --> 20:54.130
So we're looking for anyone
who may have seen Ellie

20:54.180 --> 20:57.340
on that Thursday evening, or
early on the Friday morning.

20:58.740 --> 21:01.090
This is Debs, Ellie's mother.

21:01.140 --> 21:03.480
She'd like to say a few words.

21:14.300 --> 21:15.640
Ellie...

21:18.020 --> 21:20.020
(Come on, sweetheart.)

21:21.340 --> 21:23.250
Ellie was a...

21:23.300 --> 21:25.370
- You all right?
- Mm.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.010
Ellie was a beautiful young woman.

21:35.060 --> 21:38.610
Kind, helpful.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.860
Loved by all who knew her.

21:42.740 --> 21:46.300
Three days ago, she had hopes
and dreams for her life.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.340
Those have been shattered.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.530
Someone was with her.

21:54.580 --> 21:57.020
Someone knows what happened.

21:59.100 --> 22:03.330
If you can help, if you've
seen anything suspicious,

22:03.380 --> 22:07.060
no matter how small or insignificant...

22:09.300 --> 22:11.780
.. please call the police.

22:13.940 --> 22:15.210
Hey!

22:15.260 --> 22:17.210
How's Beth?

22:17.260 --> 22:18.970
Yeah, she's really impressed me.

22:19.020 --> 22:22.220
- She's with Clint again,
learning pop-ups. - Hm.

22:24.660 --> 22:26.370
- That's interesting.
- What?

22:26.420 --> 22:29.490
Someone's reported a man acting
suspiciously the day Ellie died.

22:29.540 --> 22:33.340
Parked his car in the morning,
picked it up a few hours later on.

22:34.820 --> 22:36.850
- Bit tight for time of
death, but... - Where?

22:36.900 --> 22:38.730
Blaze Sands.

22:38.780 --> 22:41.520
There's a registration number, as well.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.340
Who is it?

22:56.620 --> 22:58.010
Right, thanks, Alex.

22:58.060 --> 23:00.900
I need to speak to your dad in private.

23:03.460 --> 23:05.540
- Dean.
- Davey.

23:06.740 --> 23:08.810
You mind if I sit down?

23:13.380 --> 23:16.450
When you phoned Cath
to tell her about Ellie,

23:16.500 --> 23:19.250
you said you'd just finished your shift.

23:19.300 --> 23:22.530
Your station says you left work at 5:40am.

23:22.580 --> 23:25.490
That's over four hours
earlier. Said you felt ill.

23:25.540 --> 23:28.090
So, where were you?

23:28.140 --> 23:30.170
I did...?! Mate, you know
I'd never hurt Ellie!

23:30.220 --> 23:32.360
Just answer the question.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.340
I was with, um... a woman.

23:40.420 --> 23:42.020
Married bit.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.780
You can't tell Cath, all right?

23:46.780 --> 23:48.330
All right.

23:48.380 --> 23:49.850
What's her name?

23:49.900 --> 23:51.240
I can't.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.850
OK. Let's take this down
the station, then, shall we?

23:54.900 --> 23:56.840
All right, all right!

23:57.940 --> 24:00.330
Thing is...

24:00.380 --> 24:03.490
I like to enjoy certain things.

24:03.540 --> 24:07.060
Adult things... outside.

24:08.420 --> 24:12.020
And I like people... to watch.

24:13.980 --> 24:16.810
Are you talking about what I
think you're talking about?

24:16.860 --> 24:19.090
I'm not talking about jogging, am I?

24:19.140 --> 24:21.650
There's a site down near Blaze Sands.

24:21.700 --> 24:24.300
I left work early to go down there.

24:25.940 --> 24:28.650
All right. Can anyone confirm that?

24:28.700 --> 24:32.650
Yeah, but I wouldn't know who
to ask. Most of us wear masks.

24:32.700 --> 24:36.220
- Including you? - Yeah! I don't
want to get recognised, do I?!

24:38.380 --> 24:42.490
Dan Connell, from down my nick,
he caught me a few months back.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.340
Never reported it.

24:45.100 --> 24:46.490
Talk to him.

24:46.540 --> 24:50.330
All right. So, er... is
this, like, a regular thing?

24:50.380 --> 24:52.210
I'm not proud of it, mate, I have urges!

24:52.260 --> 24:55.620
Well, I'd knock them on the head,
if I were you. Does Cath know?

24:56.940 --> 24:59.610
I forgot to delete my search history.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.010
He always had a wandering eye.
He tried it on with me once.

25:09.060 --> 25:11.010
- Dean?
- Yeah.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.530
A week before the leavers' disco.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.690
Before I left.

25:16.740 --> 25:18.410
What, when you and me were...?

25:18.460 --> 25:22.860
Yeah. I mean, I told Cath.
I had to, she was a mate.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.970
- Do you believe him?
- Yeah.

25:26.020 --> 25:27.330
Dan Connell down at his station

25:27.380 --> 25:30.380
said he'd picked him
up for it before, so...

25:31.500 --> 25:33.570
Did he really try it on?

25:33.820 --> 25:35.890
He didn't get very far.

25:36.260 --> 25:39.460
- Put it this way, he was limping
for quite a while afterwards. - Hm!

25:40.940 --> 25:43.210
So, you going to cross him
off your Christmas card list?

25:43.260 --> 25:44.410
He was never on it.

25:44.460 --> 25:46.570
I thought you two were close.

25:46.620 --> 25:49.490
Well, we were, until he
got together with Cath.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.330
You were friends with her at school.

25:51.380 --> 25:53.570
No, you were friends with her at school.

25:53.620 --> 25:56.090
I never really liked her myself.

25:57.980 --> 25:59.770
So, er... your mum and Mick coming today?

25:59.820 --> 26:02.570
- Yeah, and Beth. She's
meeting us here. - Beth?

26:02.620 --> 26:04.330
She offered to hold my hand.

26:04.380 --> 26:06.370
Feeling guilty because she's going camping

26:06.420 --> 26:08.090
with some friends from London later.

26:08.140 --> 26:10.970
- How's her surfing?
- Er... yeah, she's a slow learner.

26:11.020 --> 26:12.610
She's a bit clumsy, to be honest.

26:12.660 --> 26:15.660
- I wonder where she
gets that from(?) - Oi!

26:16.380 --> 26:18.860
Right, I'll see you down there.

26:29.140 --> 26:32.170
Mum, I shouldn't be here.

26:32.220 --> 26:34.250
This is for people that knew her.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.240
Can I sit in the car?

26:37.620 --> 26:39.090
Yeah, sure.

26:40.500 --> 26:41.900
Thanks.

26:43.220 --> 26:46.290
- See you in there. - We have to sit close
together. What will people think?

26:46.340 --> 26:48.130
Yeah well, you should have
thought of that before you...

26:48.180 --> 26:49.890
Alex, for your mum, please?

26:49.940 --> 26:52.610
Oh, right, now? Now
you're thinking about her?

26:52.660 --> 26:54.570
Nothing at all?

26:54.620 --> 26:57.330
I've got officers rechecking
the local hospitals.

26:57.380 --> 26:59.170
Someone must've seen something.

26:59.220 --> 27:01.090
Yeah, I know, love.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.490
Thank you, for releasing Ellie's body.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.740
It's the least we could do.

27:10.100 --> 27:11.210
Do you know her?

27:11.260 --> 27:14.770
Megan. Used to be Ellie's best
mate. Not seen her in months.

27:14.820 --> 27:16.530
It's time, love.

27:16.580 --> 27:18.740
(Come on.)

27:30.700 --> 27:32.890
I saw her outside Debs'.

27:32.940 --> 27:34.690
She said she didn't know Ellie.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.340
- Strange.
- I know.

27:39.460 --> 27:42.860
Do you think Dean told Cath
where he was last night?

27:42.940 --> 27:45.380
- Would you?
- Huh!

28:05.700 --> 28:08.570
Do not judge a biography by its length...

28:11.100 --> 28:13.700
.. nor by the number of pages in it.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.770
Judge it by the richness of its contents.

28:18.820 --> 28:21.900
Sometimes those unfinished
are among the most poignant.

28:26.220 --> 28:28.960
Do not judge a song by its duration...

28:30.580 --> 28:33.120
.. nor by the number of its notes.

28:34.380 --> 28:37.680
Judge it by the way it
touches and lifts the soul.

28:39.140 --> 28:45.220
Sometimes those unfinished are
among the most... beautiful.

28:47.300 --> 28:49.810
And when something has enriched your life,

28:49.860 --> 28:52.860
and when its melody lingers
on in your heart...

28:57.660 --> 28:59.700
.. is it unfinished?

29:01.700 --> 29:03.500
Or is it endless?

29:07.260 --> 29:09.000
I want to speak.

29:19.020 --> 29:21.330
Everyone says their kids are perfect,

29:21.380 --> 29:24.580
but Ellie... she really was.

29:26.300 --> 29:27.730
Never any trouble.

29:27.780 --> 29:29.450
Always helpful.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.040
Ellie didn't die in the crash.

29:36.180 --> 29:39.780
Ellie died because someone
dragged her out of the car.

29:41.780 --> 29:45.080
If they'd called for help,
she'd still be alive...

29:47.460 --> 29:49.330
.. but they didn't.

29:50.820 --> 29:52.250
They left her,

29:52.300 --> 29:54.100
and wiped the car.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.130
Wiped it clean!

29:59.020 --> 30:01.360
Someone here knows something.

30:03.620 --> 30:07.860
If you have any decency... you'll say.

30:10.180 --> 30:11.920
If not for me...

30:13.140 --> 30:14.700
.. for her.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.880
Else you have no right being here.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.690
Cos my Ellie...

30:24.980 --> 30:27.050
.. my beautiful Ellie...

30:28.860 --> 30:31.060
.. she deserves the truth.

30:32.100 --> 30:35.140
- Come on, love. - Any of you
got the guts to tell the truth?

30:36.340 --> 30:38.680
Or are you just here to gawk?

30:38.980 --> 30:40.810
It's funny she's got so many friends here

30:40.860 --> 30:44.360
cos none of you could be
bothered when she was alive.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.900
(Debbie? Come on.)

30:50.500 --> 30:52.300
Give me a minute.

31:06.300 --> 31:11.100
♪ Abide with me... ♪

31:12.180 --> 31:13.820
Megan!

31:15.340 --> 31:18.540
What happened between you and
Ellie? Why'd you drop her?

31:20.300 --> 31:22.780
Talk to me. Talk!

31:24.100 --> 31:27.290
She... she started going out with
Nick and she knew that I liked him.

31:27.340 --> 31:30.970
You dropped her because
of that? Because of him?

31:31.020 --> 31:33.490
- I'm sorry.
- So you should be!

31:34.460 --> 31:36.770
Cos if you hadn't, she
might still be here.

31:36.820 --> 31:39.360
You should be ashamed of yourself!

31:44.580 --> 31:47.450
Megan! What are you doing here?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.570
Were you at the funeral?

31:51.180 --> 31:53.320
You knew her, didn't you?

31:54.300 --> 31:56.290
What is it?

31:56.340 --> 31:58.940
- Go, just go!
- What's going on?!

32:00.180 --> 32:02.130
Get out!

32:02.180 --> 32:04.920
Not until you tell me what's going on.

32:10.180 --> 32:12.970
- Is everything OK?
- What are we going to do?

32:13.020 --> 32:15.570
We can't hold the funeral,
vicar's got another service after.

32:15.620 --> 32:18.660
- I'll go and find her.
- No, no, you should stay here. We'll go.

32:20.060 --> 32:22.000
Can you come with me?

32:26.620 --> 32:28.560
I'll take the beach.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.160
Shall we go back up?

32:51.180 --> 32:52.980
What's the point?

32:54.700 --> 32:56.840
You mustn't give up hope.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.650
We'll find out what happened.

32:59.700 --> 33:01.460
Will we?

33:03.420 --> 33:05.980
I thought I knew Ellie.

33:07.500 --> 33:09.640
I didn't know her at all.

33:11.500 --> 33:14.800
Didn't know why she fell
out with Megan until now.

33:15.100 --> 33:16.900
What did she say?

33:17.500 --> 33:19.300
It was over Nick.

33:20.340 --> 33:22.740
Megan liked him and Ellie knew.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.890
Can you go?

33:28.580 --> 33:30.920
I just want to be with Ellie.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.380
Be with her?

33:38.980 --> 33:40.780
Figure of speech.

33:47.260 --> 33:48.690
Debbie?

33:48.740 --> 33:50.770
Oh, Debbie, how many have you taken?

33:50.820 --> 33:53.580
Come here, come here. Come here.

34:01.540 --> 34:05.580
So, this is your plan? What, just
keep driving and say nothing?!

34:06.740 --> 34:07.930
Oh, thank God you found her!

34:07.980 --> 34:09.969
Look after her. The
ambulance is on its way.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.020
- Thanks, Jane.
- OK.

34:14.580 --> 34:16.850
Megan told Debs they
fell out because of Nick.

34:16.900 --> 34:19.610
- Well, they weren't even together.
- What if Megan was driving?

34:19.659 --> 34:22.010
I mean, we don't know Ellie
was going to meet a boy.

34:22.060 --> 34:23.370
Don't suppose you've seen Beth?

34:23.420 --> 34:25.409
It's just I've just found
these in the ignition.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.850
She was waiting in the car. Where is she?

34:27.900 --> 34:29.370
I think I might know.

34:29.420 --> 34:32.610
OK, Beth was never learning how to surf.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.530
She was with Megan.

34:46.460 --> 34:48.449
We're going to Plymouth?

34:48.500 --> 34:50.730
- They're heading for Plymouth.
- 'Why Plymouth?'

34:50.780 --> 34:53.210
Alright, can you get a car
registration out for a Megan Chapman

34:53.260 --> 34:54.250
to all units, please?

34:54.300 --> 34:57.450
- They're on their way to Plymouth.
- Is that where you went with Ellie?!

34:57.500 --> 34:59.850
How do you know her?!

34:59.900 --> 35:01.330
We'll find her, don't worry.

35:01.380 --> 35:03.210
Megan, she was drinking!

35:03.260 --> 35:05.600
- Megan!
- Shut up. Shut up!

35:06.940 --> 35:08.530
Slow down!

35:08.580 --> 35:10.250
Megan, please!

35:14.500 --> 35:16.690
Stop it! You're scaring me! Stop it!

35:16.740 --> 35:19.370
It was all my fault.

35:19.420 --> 35:21.330
What was, Megan?!

35:21.380 --> 35:23.060
Ellie.

35:30.360 --> 35:31.970
They've spotted them.

35:32.020 --> 35:34.890
They can't chase them! Don't
let Beth get caught in a chase!

35:34.940 --> 35:38.370
All right, all right. You got
a stinger? Use a stinger.

35:41.060 --> 35:43.260
They've gone.

35:44.900 --> 35:48.500
Slow down, you're drunk!
You're going to get us killed!

36:03.460 --> 36:05.570
Why did you say Ellie was your fault?!

36:05.620 --> 36:06.850
I'm about to interview her.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.600
- Shouldn't you be with Beth?
- She's with Mum. Well...?

36:11.020 --> 36:12.850
I dropped her.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.570
If I hadn't...

36:15.860 --> 36:18.860
If I'd been there...
she might still be here.

36:21.740 --> 36:24.370
- She was my best friend. - Why did
you drop her? - Jane, leave it.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.690
Debs said it was over Nick,
but we know it wasn't him!

36:26.740 --> 36:29.330
I saw them kissing.

36:29.380 --> 36:31.410
- She knew I liked him.
- Who?

36:31.460 --> 36:34.660
She made me promise not
to say. They both did.

36:38.220 --> 36:40.050
He was there today.

36:40.100 --> 36:43.220
You were watching him outside
the church, I saw you!

36:57.300 --> 36:59.690
Oh. Er... Cath's back.

36:59.740 --> 37:03.610
Debs is in ITU, but she's
going to be fine, apparently.

37:03.660 --> 37:05.530
Can we come inside?

37:17.700 --> 37:19.130
Going away?

37:19.180 --> 37:21.930
Um... yeah. Alex is too upset to stay.

37:21.980 --> 37:24.530
Going to stay with Dean's
sister up in Durham.

37:24.580 --> 37:26.130
Ah, that's a nice idea, isn't it?

37:26.180 --> 37:28.410
Might want to carry that
out to the car, then.

37:28.460 --> 37:30.530
- I've got it.
- Argh!

37:31.580 --> 37:33.050
Broken ribs?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.970
You were never here the morning
I came around, were you, Alex?

37:36.020 --> 37:39.010
- You've got two cars. There were
none when I was here. - What?

37:39.060 --> 37:41.890
Did you get together with Ellie
after helping her with her GCSEs?

37:41.940 --> 37:44.690
- Is this a joke?
- You were her boyfriend.

37:44.740 --> 37:47.650
That's why you had to keep
it secret, why you both did.

37:47.700 --> 37:50.650
But it was you that was
driving the car that night.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.170
He was with me.

37:52.220 --> 37:55.420
So, who did you call for
help -- your mum or your dad?

37:58.220 --> 38:02.010
Your mum. And then you went around,
cleaned the steering wheel,

38:02.060 --> 38:04.330
got rid of Ellie's phone,
took Alex to a hospital,

38:04.380 --> 38:05.890
somewhere not too close.

38:05.940 --> 38:07.930
In his car, of course.

38:07.980 --> 38:09.770
You couldn't leave that at Blaze Sands.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.170
You parked yours nearby,
picked it up on the way back.

38:12.220 --> 38:14.490
So, why were you driving
Ellie back that night?

38:14.540 --> 38:16.810
Because she was drunk
and you were worried?

38:16.860 --> 38:20.530
I mean, you were together, what,
six months? You must've been close.

38:20.580 --> 38:22.250
This is ridiculous!

38:22.300 --> 38:23.970
You loved her.

38:24.820 --> 38:28.220
You wanted to tell me. That's why
you came to see me at my office.

38:29.340 --> 38:31.340
Did your mum stop you?

38:31.860 --> 38:34.060
Persuade you to blame Nick?

38:35.300 --> 38:38.260
Son, don't say anything.

38:48.340 --> 38:50.490
She got drunk because
I was late meeting her.

38:50.540 --> 38:52.410
I couldn't let her drive.

38:52.460 --> 38:54.400
I thought I'd be OK.

38:55.780 --> 38:59.050
It was only when we were on the
road I realised I was drunk, too.

38:59.100 --> 39:02.300
Let's keep driving, get
away. As far as we can.

39:03.660 --> 39:05.930
I've got uni next month, El.

39:08.140 --> 39:10.330
It won't make any difference to us.

39:10.380 --> 39:12.210
Won't it? You'll forget about me.

39:12.260 --> 39:15.570
Huh! How could I forget
about you, you nutter?

39:15.620 --> 39:17.490
I love you.

39:17.540 --> 39:19.280
I love you more.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.370
Let's get you home so you can get
some sleep before your mum gets back.

39:24.420 --> 39:26.490
Just sleep? Spoilsport!

39:32.260 --> 39:34.570
It was over in seconds.

39:34.620 --> 39:38.570
I was worried the car would catch fire.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.250
I had to get her out.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.610
She said her chest hurt.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.700
And when I moved her,
she started screaming.

39:47.180 --> 39:49.120
She couldn't breathe.

39:52.300 --> 39:54.100
And then she...

39:58.740 --> 40:00.480
It was too late.

40:02.460 --> 40:04.800
I didn't know what else to do.

40:05.540 --> 40:07.610
So you called your mum.

40:08.380 --> 40:11.250
And Dean owed you because of
what he'd put you through,

40:11.300 --> 40:13.570
almost destroying your marriage.

40:13.620 --> 40:15.490
So you cleared Ellie's room,

40:15.540 --> 40:18.050
made sure there was no
sign of their relationship.

40:18.100 --> 40:20.410
But you didn't know about the charger.

40:20.460 --> 40:23.730
He's my son. You'd anything for your kids.

40:23.780 --> 40:26.120
We don't have to say anything.

40:27.380 --> 40:30.380
Alex could go away! We
won't breathe a word.

40:31.460 --> 40:33.970
- We don't have to wreck
his life, too! - Cath?

40:34.020 --> 40:37.050
Ellie would've wanted
him to have a future!

40:37.100 --> 40:39.370
(We can keep this a secret!)

40:41.940 --> 40:43.680
I don't want to.

40:45.140 --> 40:47.530
Ellie would've known what
lying would do to me.

40:47.580 --> 40:49.320
It was my fault.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.410
It won't ever happen again.

40:58.460 --> 41:01.780
Don't blame Clint, blame me. I
should never have listened to Megan.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.090
Or anyone that's not you.

41:05.140 --> 41:06.930
- Obviously.
- Obviously.

41:06.980 --> 41:11.300
So you're buying the drinks tonight
and Mick's dishwasher's broken.

41:13.020 --> 41:15.490
What an excellent use of my time.

41:17.940 --> 41:20.370
I thought your mum and Mick
would have cancelled tonight,

41:20.420 --> 41:21.850
you know, after the funeral.

41:21.900 --> 41:24.490
No, made Mum even more determined.

41:24.540 --> 41:26.850
Let the dead rest and
the living keep living.

41:26.900 --> 41:30.010
She speaks sense sometimes,
your mum. Not very often, mind.

41:30.060 --> 41:31.650
So, what are they doing?

41:40.260 --> 41:41.810

It's petty. Really petty.

Yeah.

42:36.700 --> 42:38.900
Well, I never told you why.

42:40.300 --> 42:43.250
It was cos of what she said -- Cath.

Someone clever. Clever, like you.

Annette for ages.

43:11.860 --> 43:14.200
I never wanted anyone but you!
