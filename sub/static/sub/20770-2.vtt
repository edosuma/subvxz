02:04.959 --> 02:08.671
Now...I can only give you
a short visit.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.506
Thank you, Dave.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.070
George says they're not
gonna let you out on bail.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.746
I'm‒

02:42.872 --> 02:44.665
I'm in so much trouble.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.216
I have‒

02:54.341 --> 02:56.302
I have to tell you something.

03:01.557 --> 03:05.060
I wasn't there,

03:05.186 --> 03:07.479
but I h‒

03:07.605 --> 03:11.150
I had a dream that night

03:11.275 --> 03:12.651
that‒

03:12.776 --> 03:14.862
that I was in her apartment.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.908
You were there.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.618
Your fingerprints are there.

03:20.743 --> 03:23.913
No, I sw‒I swear to you,
I wasn't there.

03:24.038 --> 03:27.249
I swear to you,
it was a dream!

03:27.374 --> 03:28.918
Fuck you.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.628
You fucking bastard!

03:32.463 --> 03:35.633
I've known about this affair.

03:35.758 --> 03:38.427
I've known about this affair
all along.

03:43.098 --> 03:46.477
Now, you lookee here.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.938
I know about you and George

03:49.063 --> 03:51.190
and maybe somebody else too!

03:55.986 --> 03:58.280
You're going down.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.617
Life in prison, Bill.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.620
Life in prison.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.596
Good-bye, Bill.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.782
Oh, my God.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.413
Oh, my‒

04:47.538 --> 04:49.206
oh, my God.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.170
Oh, my‒

04:55.296 --> 04:56.755
oh, my God.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.388
George.

05:04.513 --> 05:06.056
Phyllis.

05:06.181 --> 05:07.599
How is he?

05:07.725 --> 05:09.101
He knows.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.689
Don't walk me out.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.651
I'll see you later at my place.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.873
How's he doing?

05:30.998 --> 05:32.916
Well, he's, uh,

05:33.042 --> 05:35.419
pretty shook up,
I have to admit.

05:35.544 --> 05:37.588
And Phyllis?

05:37.713 --> 05:40.549
She's had a really rough day,
I believe.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.427
Yes.
I understand.

05:44.762 --> 05:47.890
Oh, my God.

05:48.015 --> 05:50.392
Oh.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.312
Oh, my God.

05:53.437 --> 05:55.773
Oh, my God.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.568
Oh, my God.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.525
What are you doing here?

06:49.660 --> 06:51.995
You did good.

06:52.121 --> 06:54.623
You follow
human nature perfectly.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.961
This is George's gun.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.656
Roger, come in here.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
Tell her she has the job.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.600
Mr. Todd?

07:54.725 --> 07:56.351
Yes, Roger?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.730
Can I ask you a question?

08:01.315 --> 08:02.357
Go ahead.

08:06.195 --> 08:09.615
Why do you let him
make you...

08:09.740 --> 08:11.200
do these things?

08:23.837 --> 08:25.923
Roger...

08:29.551 --> 08:31.803
...you better hope

08:31.929 --> 08:35.015
that you never get involved
with someone like him.

08:38.852 --> 08:41.563
Never have someone like him

08:41.688 --> 08:43.857
in your life.

09:47.421 --> 09:50.507
Jack, you barely touched
your three dinners.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.475
Darya said something about you,

10:00.600 --> 10:02.561
uh, being worried
about tomorrow?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.688
Or the day after?

10:10.610 --> 10:13.155
I'm not worried, Ray,

10:13.280 --> 10:14.489
about anything.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.491
Well, that's good.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.202
For a while,
day after tomorrow,

10:19.328 --> 10:21.204
I'll need to be on my own.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.165
That might be a good time
for you to learn

10:23.290 --> 10:25.000
how to mind your own business.

10:26.877 --> 10:28.545
Well...

10:28.670 --> 10:30.881
meantime, there's anything
I can do to help,

10:31.006 --> 10:32.341
just let me know.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.052
I'll be sure
to let you know, Ray.

10:37.179 --> 10:39.389
And I'll follow up
on that contact of mine,

10:39.514 --> 10:41.767
hopefully get
the information you need.

10:41.892 --> 10:44.186
Want,

10:44.311 --> 10:45.562
not need.

10:48.315 --> 10:52.486
I don't need anything, Ray.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.575
If there's one thing
you should know

10:58.700 --> 11:02.037
about me, Ray,

11:02.162 --> 11:05.457
it's that I don't need anything.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.833
I want.

11:09.211 --> 11:11.588
And I want that information.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.680
Kind of funny
that she'll only give it to you.

11:25.143 --> 11:28.188
This information seems
pretty important to you.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.491
Don't worry.
I'll get it for you.

11:39.616 --> 11:43.745
And I better be able
to trust that information.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.914
She's Hastings' secretary.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.250
She knows what he knows.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.121
Margaret?

13:08.246 --> 13:10.290
Hawk.

13:11.625 --> 13:14.461
Where are you walking tonight?

13:15.337 --> 13:19.090
Once again, your log and I
are on the same page.

13:19.216 --> 13:22.969
Supposed to be something
happening here tonight.

13:24.679 --> 13:28.058
The stars turn...

13:28.183 --> 13:31.394
and a time presents itself.

13:33.522 --> 13:35.941
Hawk,

13:36.066 --> 13:38.443
watch carefully.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.821
I will, Margaret.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.660
I'm too weak to go with you.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.414
But stop by.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.251
I have coffee and pie for you.

13:55.710 --> 13:59.089
Gonna have to be after.
I'm almost there now.

14:01.049 --> 14:04.177
Please, let me know
what happens.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.974
<i>I will, Margaret.</i>

14:10.225 --> 14:12.352
Good night, Margaret.

17:50.236 --> 17:53.072
Are you Laura Palmer?

18:26.272 --> 18:29.150
Who are you?

18:42.997 --> 18:46.334
But Laura Palmer is dead.

19:58.448 --> 20:00.950
When can I go?

20:45.745 --> 20:47.080
Whisper.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.139
Huh.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.731
Jack, come here.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.498
Shit.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.500
He's coming.
I have to get off the phone.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.341
Hi, baby.

27:17.803 --> 27:19.305
Who you talking to?

27:21.349 --> 27:23.392
Um, Jack.

27:26.354 --> 27:29.106
Just making sure I get the job done
on the secretary's car.

27:29.231 --> 27:30.316
Mm.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.028
What did Jack say?

27:34.153 --> 27:37.031
He said it's all good to go.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.330
I'm happy to see you.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.293
I thought maybe you'd

27:49.418 --> 27:52.254
gone off on your own for a while,
like you were saying.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.551
You're happy to see me, Darya?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.554
Yeah, baby.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.684
That's nice, Darya.

28:10.356 --> 28:12.817
Ray was supposed
to meet me this afternoon.

28:12.942 --> 28:15.277
- He never showed.
- Oh, yeah?

28:16.529 --> 28:18.072
Yeah.

28:23.536 --> 28:25.871
Where's that.45
of yours, Darya?

28:27.039 --> 28:29.208
I've got it here by the bed.

28:41.887 --> 28:43.139
What's up?

28:45.057 --> 28:47.268
Might want to borrow it
for a job.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.859
What's mine is yours.

29:21.969 --> 29:24.221
Darya, Jack is dead.

29:24.346 --> 29:28.434
I killed Jack two hours ago
after he wired the car.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.355
Don't move...

29:34.440 --> 29:35.941
...one muscle.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.870
I'm gonna play something
for you, Darya.

29:52.791 --> 29:54.668
I think we'll both
find this interesting.

29:56.504 --> 29:57.588
<i>Darya, is that you?</i>

29:57.713 --> 30:00.049
<i>Ray, where the hell are you?</i>

30:00.174 --> 30:04.220
<i>Federal prison, South Dakota.</i>

30:04.345 --> 30:06.180
<i>What the fuck?
What did you do, Ray?</i>

30:06.305 --> 30:07.932
<i>Carried weapons
over the state line.</i>

30:08.057 --> 30:11.769
<i>I fucked up,
the worst possible moment.</i>

30:11.894 --> 30:13.687
<i>How are you calling me?</i>

30:13.812 --> 30:15.356
<i>This is a burner.
Don't worry about it.</i>

30:15.481 --> 30:17.900
<i>Nobody's listening.</i>

30:18.025 --> 30:20.236
<i>So what do we do
about Cooper?</i>

30:20.361 --> 30:22.363
<i>I got another call
from Jeffries.</i>

30:22.488 --> 30:25.449
<i>You have to hit Cooper
if he's still around tomorrow night.</i>

30:25.574 --> 30:28.702
<i>That means you now, Darya.
You have to do this.</i>

30:28.827 --> 30:30.246
<i>Fuck.</i>

30:30.371 --> 30:31.872
<i>Fuck, I think his car just pulled up.</i>

30:31.997 --> 30:33.582
<i>Fuck!</i>

30:33.707 --> 30:35.376
<i>Let's see what happens tomorrow.</i>

30:35.501 --> 30:38.379
<i>If I have to, I'll take him out.</i>

30:38.504 --> 30:40.589
<i>Shit, he's coming.
I got to get off the phone.</i>

30:52.726 --> 30:53.936
Shh.

31:07.199 --> 31:09.159
Are you going to kill me?

31:10.953 --> 31:12.371
Yes, Darya.

31:17.710 --> 31:19.587
Shit!

31:33.934 --> 31:35.728
Darya...

31:38.939 --> 31:42.443
...who hired you and Ray
to kill me?

31:42.568 --> 31:46.030
I don't know.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.034
I don't know.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.623
I swear, I don't...

31:55.748 --> 31:56.957
Hmm?

31:57.082 --> 31:59.043
Ray knows.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.758
I don't know.
He never told me.

32:07.593 --> 32:10.220
Do you really expect me
to believe that Ray's

32:10.346 --> 32:13.432
in prison for carrying guns
over a state line?

32:15.601 --> 32:16.977
Darya, look at me.

32:20.439 --> 32:23.359
This is quite an interesting thing
to think about.

32:25.486 --> 32:27.821
The game begins.

32:30.658 --> 32:33.118
Did he say why
they want me dead?

32:34.787 --> 32:36.872
No, I don't know why.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.003
How much do they want me dead?
What are they paying you?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.552
We'd split a half a million.

32:57.267 --> 32:59.812
I wouldn't have done it.

33:00.896 --> 33:02.064
I just said that to Ray.

33:02.189 --> 33:03.816
Shut up, Darya.

33:14.076 --> 33:16.912
But...

33:17.037 --> 33:21.041
you said you were going away
somewhere tomorrow.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.293
Tomorrow,

33:23.419 --> 33:25.045
I'm supposed to get pulled back

33:25.170 --> 33:28.215
into what they call
the Black Lodge.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.593
But I'm not going back there.
I've got a plan for that one.

33:34.847 --> 33:38.517
But this prison thing
with that fucker Ray...

33:44.523 --> 33:46.233
Darya, did Ray
get that information

33:46.358 --> 33:49.236
from Hastings' secretary?

33:50.904 --> 33:54.158
Did he ever mention
coordinates to you?

33:55.409 --> 33:58.287
I don't know what that is.

33:58.412 --> 34:01.623
Geographical coordinates,
numbers, letters.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.626
They could save your life.

34:08.922 --> 34:11.508
He said she told him something,
but I don't know what.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.108
Anybody ever show this
to you before?

34:32.446 --> 34:36.366
Do you know what this is?

34:36.492 --> 34:39.119
Huh?

34:39.244 --> 34:41.747
Did you ever see
anything like this?

34:44.291 --> 34:47.294
This is what I want.

34:58.764 --> 35:01.308
Are you gonna kill me now?

35:01.433 --> 35:03.268
Yes, Darya.

36:34.359 --> 36:35.569
Phillip?

36:35.694 --> 36:36.945
<i>You're late.</i>

36:37.070 --> 36:38.906
Couldn't be helped.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.782
<i>I missed you in New York,</i>

36:40.908 --> 36:42.743
<i>but I see you're still
in Buckhorn.</i>

36:42.868 --> 36:45.579
And you're still nowhere,
is that correct?

36:45.704 --> 36:49.708
<i>You met with
Major Garland Briggs.</i>

36:51.043 --> 36:52.544
How did you know that?

36:54.880 --> 36:56.173
Phillip?

36:56.298 --> 36:59.635
<i>Actually, I just called
to say good-bye.</i>

37:02.888 --> 37:05.307
This is Phillip Jeffries, right?

37:05.432 --> 37:07.476
<i>You're going back in tomorrow,</i>

37:07.601 --> 37:09.603
<i>and I will be with Bob again.</i>

37:09.728 --> 37:11.438
Who is this?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.069
<i>Yeah?</i>

39:22.194 --> 39:23.528
It's me.

39:36.583 --> 39:38.919
I need you to clean up
in room six.

39:39.044 --> 39:40.337
Everything.

39:40.462 --> 39:41.630
Darya?

39:41.755 --> 39:43.423
That's good news.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.884
I was getting so jealous
of that bitch.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.929
Then go get your husband.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.598
I need you and Hutch
in a certain area

39:51.723 --> 39:54.101
in a few days.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.311
I'll get word to you.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.271
Okay, boss.

40:03.819 --> 40:05.821
Chantal,

40:05.946 --> 40:07.739
come here.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.132
Oh.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.008
You're nice and wet.

40:27.134 --> 40:29.302
Mm.

46:39.172 --> 46:41.049
Weird.

46:41.174 --> 46:42.800
Where is he?

46:44.052 --> 46:46.221
Does this, by any chance,
mean that I can

46:46.346 --> 46:48.014
go in there with you?

46:48.139 --> 46:49.891
I brought us two lattes again.

49:23.378 --> 49:26.714
