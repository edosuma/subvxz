00:14.500 --> 00:17.166
What are you guys still
doing here? It's 9:20.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.166
I'm twenty minutes late.

00:19.208 --> 00:22.166
Yesterday I was fifteen minutes
late and you didn't leave.

00:22.208 --> 00:25.125
I thought today I'll be twenty
minutes late and maybe
they'll get it.

00:25.166 --> 00:27.291
Maybe they'll be gone when I
come in.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.208
-So, you want us to leave?
-This isn't what I want.

00:29.250 --> 00:31.917
It's what I want for you.
It's what I want you to want.

00:31.959 --> 00:34.083
I want you to want to leave.

00:34.125 --> 00:36.417
Look, when I was a student in
school we had an unwritten rule.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.625
A little student-teacher pact.

00:38.667 --> 00:41.709
If a teacher was fifteen minutes
late, as students, we left.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.750
And we gave that teacher a nice
little break they didn't expect.

00:44.792 --> 00:47.125
It's not something we talked
about, it just happened.

00:47.166 --> 00:50.750
Who sits and stares at
nothing for twenty minutes?

00:50.792 --> 00:52.917
There's nothing on the board.
Who does that?

00:52.959 --> 00:56.625
Not leaders, followers. You kids
today, you don't take
initiative.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.917
Here's what I'm gonna do, I'm
gonna give you a chance to
redeem yourselves tomorrow

00:59.959 --> 01:02.959
and be leaders. I'm going to be
twenty-five minutes late.

01:03.041 --> 01:05.375
[Shh's without a sound]
Write it down, whatever
you gotta do.

01:05.417 --> 01:09.291
When I come in...
I didn't say leave.

01:10.667 --> 01:12.792
-Why would we leave? We're here
to learn.

01:12.834 --> 01:15.000
-Oh, you're here to learn?
'Cause you haven't learned this.

01:15.041 --> 01:17.208
It's been three days.
-We can leave now if you want.

01:17.250 --> 01:19.375
-No, that's not the point.
Then I look like the bad guy.

01:19.417 --> 01:22.625
I thought, maybe I'll come in
late and they'll leave and
they'll do their own thing.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.792
Now you're here.
Congratulations.

Hey, here's a question.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.375
Would you ever consider DJing
a high school dance?

02:28.417 --> 02:32.000
-I'd love to. I've been trying
to break into the high school
market for years.

02:32.041 --> 02:35.041
It's so competitive.
-Soooo competitive.

02:35.083 --> 02:38.291
Well, I happen to teach at
Xavier and we're having a dance.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.125
And the DJ, just like, I got a
text, like, five minutes ago...

02:41.166 --> 02:44.250
that, ah, he can't do it.

-Alright. Bye, Ginger.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.458
-[Dave]: Okay, okay, you've
got law of demand.

03:18.500 --> 03:22.792
Where there is an inverse
relationship between price...

03:22.834 --> 03:25.000
And quantity demand.
You feel me?

03:25.041 --> 03:26.875
Then you got law of supply...

03:26.917 --> 03:31.166
Which is the fundamental
principal that states,
if all else is equal,

03:31.208 --> 03:35.792
an increase in price results in
an increase in quantity
supplied.

03:35.834 --> 03:40.041
And that, my budding
learners, is supply and demand.

03:40.083 --> 03:41.208
Any questions?

03:42.834 --> 03:46.083
C'mon, put your phones away.
This is very important stuff.

my heart and soul into each

dead eyes.

percent on track.
-What?

-Look, you can never
reach all of the kids.

06:48.834 --> 06:51.792
Kids fall through the cracks and
that's just teaching.

06:51.834 --> 06:54.834
-That's not how I teach.
I wanna reach them all.

06:54.875 --> 06:57.208
-[Laughs]: That's adorable.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.959
Listen, if there's one tactic
that I've observed over the
years

07:01.000 --> 07:05.125
that can really keep a teacher
afloat, it's this: care less.

07:05.166 --> 07:08.875

counsellor? That's really bleak.
