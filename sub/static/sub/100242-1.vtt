WEBVTT

00:37.267 --> 00:38.792
Who are you?

00:38.869 --> 00:41.497
I'm your worst fucking nightmare,
that's who I am.

00:42.372 --> 00:44.864
I'm talking to you! That's who!

00:45.042 --> 00:47.272
What? I don't give a damn!

00:47.444 --> 00:51.279
You're violating the most basic and
sacred rights of a small-business owner.

00:51.381 --> 00:54.943
We're talking about a kid
who doesn't have the means to fight you.

00:55.119 --> 00:57.519
gonna bury you, you motherfucker.

00:57.955 --> 00:59.184
You threatening me?

01:00.457 --> 01:02.482
Hey, do it to my face.

01:02.659 --> 01:05.527
You got a pen?
We're at 75 Spring Street, eighth floor.

01:06.997 --> 01:08.795
Come on by. We validate.

01:10.501 --> 01:12.492
Good talking to you, too, Senator.

01:14.071 --> 01:15.664
- Hey. Hey.
- What? Hey.

01:15.839 --> 01:17.364
- Hey, I'm talking to you.
- Yeah.

01:17.474 --> 01:18.498
Uh...

01:19.176 --> 01:20.302
I'm Richard.

01:20.477 --> 01:21.706
sorry I was listeni

01:21.779 --> 01:24.247
I didn't mean to be rude.
I wasn't raised like that.

01:25.182 --> 01:27.412
You always start
every sentence with "I"?

01:27.651 --> 01:28.812
I'm...

01:30.154 --> 01:31.985
I'm sorry, sir. I'm the new...

01:32.256 --> 01:34.019
I'm the supply room clerk.

01:35.826 --> 01:37.521
Eavesdropping on me?

01:37.694 --> 01:38.889
No, sir.

01:40.030 --> 01:41.794
Well, good. I need
some more tape, so get on that.

01:41.965 --> 01:43.160
Yeah, about that.

01:43.233 --> 01:46.294
You're gonna want to check
the second drawer down, sir.

01:46.370 --> 01:48.736
Tape and a new box of pens.

01:51.842 --> 01:53.469
I saw you were running low.

01:54.178 --> 01:55.202
What's that?

01:55.679 --> 01:58.410
You might want to check
the next drawer down.

01:58.916 --> 02:00.315
The one on the bottom.

02:07.357 --> 02:09.257
How'd you know I like Snickers?

02:10.894 --> 02:13.591
I knew you liked them

02:13.664 --> 02:16.963
'cause I saw you had the wrappers
in your trash can.

02:20.437 --> 02:22.167
Don't go in my trash.

02:22.339 --> 02:24.330
Nobody goes in my trash.
What's your name?

02:26.610 --> 02:27.941
Richard Jewell.

02:29.279 --> 02:31.111
From now on, I'm gonna call you Radar.

02:33.784 --> 02:34.774
Like from M*A*S*H?

02:34.852 --> 02:35.841
Get out.

03:11.889 --> 03:13.720
Pretty tough crowd
you're running with here.

03:14.791 --> 03:16.589
Got a little nervous coming in.

03:17.728 --> 03:19.423
How you doing, sir?

03:20.898 --> 03:23.458
Don't worry, all right
I come here often.

03:28.071 --> 03:30.097
Ooh. Nice shooting, Radar.

03:30.874 --> 03:31.705
Thank you.

03:31.775 --> 03:37.441
This is actually kind of like practice
for my future in law enforcement

03:37.614 --> 03:41.312
APD, FBI, maybe Secret Service.

03:42.119 --> 03:44.053
What the hell'd
you wanna do that for?

03:46.356 --> 03:49.417
'Cause I believe in
protecting people, sir.

03:52.996 --> 03:55.260
I study the penal code every night.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.533
Sounds like a humdinger of a night.

04:00.137 --> 04:01.570
- Yes!
- Oh.

04:02.606 --> 04:05.871
Yeah, it's not bad.
You got some beginner's luck.

04:06.043 --> 04:07.772
Yeah, what's wrong with 9,700?

04:07.844 --> 04:10.541
nothing's wrong with
for a first time.

04:10.614 --> 04:12.810
First time?
All right, come on, let's go.

04:14.718 --> 04:18.052
They only give me 30 minutes for lunch.
I got to head back in a minute.

04:18.221 --> 04:19.587
Shut up.

04:19.656 --> 04:21.283
You can say you're with me.

04:22.626 --> 04:23.821
Let's get it on.

04:24.094 --> 04:26.153
Oh, shoot. All right.

04:26.396 --> 04:27.955
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

04:28.165 --> 04:29.826
Let's see what you got, hotshot.

04:31.468 --> 04:33.493
Yeah, I mean business, too.

04:33.670 --> 04:35.195
- Yeah?
- You ever do it with one hand?

04:39.476 --> 04:40.466
Mr. Bryant?

04:40.544 --> 04:42.034
Oh, Jesus Christ.

04:42.312 --> 04:43.302
Sorry.

04:43.380 --> 04:45.906
Uh, I'm a little busy.
Not... Not a good time, so...

04:46.083 --> 04:47.243
- Yeah...
- Talk later?

04:47.417 --> 04:48.248
I know you're busy.

04:48.318 --> 04:50.878
I just wanted to
come by to let you know,

04:50.954 --> 04:52.979
I... I'm not gonna be
working here anymore.

04:53.223 --> 04:54.486
Came to say bye.

04:55.225 --> 04:58.217
Got a new job doing security.

04:58.395 --> 05:00.523
- Okay.
- So, that starts tomorrow.

05:00.797 --> 05:02.788
All right. Hey, good to see you.

05:05.602 --> 05:08.435
I wanted to give you something
before I leave.

05:09.573 --> 05:11.905
Just to say thank you.

05:12.075 --> 05:14.100
Hey, okay,

05:14.177 --> 05:15.270
Thank you.

05:18.448 --> 05:21.680
I noticed you were running low.

05:23.787 --> 05:25.186
All right.

05:26.256 --> 05:27.553
Hey, come here.

05:29.926 --> 05:31.189
- What?
- You got enough money?

05:31.895 --> 05:34.956
Yeah, I guess so. Why do you ask?

05:35.032 --> 05:37.899
This comes with a quid pro quo.
You know what that is?

05:38.435 --> 05:42.531
Yes, sir. Quid pro quo is Latin.
Uh, "This for that."

05:42.806 --> 05:45.070
That's right
Well, this comes with a quid pro quo.

05:45.142 --> 05:46.939
Fair exchange. So, here's the deal.

05:47.110 --> 05:50.546
When you get your badge
and I can see that day's coming,

05:50.614 --> 05:52.081
don't become an asshole.

05:53.383 --> 05:54.373
You got me?

05:56.887 --> 05:58.377
No, sir, I won't become an asshole.

05:58.922 --> 06:02.051
A little power can turn a person
into a monster, Richard.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.288
Don't do that

06:04.828 --> 06:06.262
Do you understand?

06:08.231 --> 06:10.063
Yeah. Um...

06:11.168 --> 06:15.264
Yeah, I'm gonna get that back to you
the first paycheck I get, sir.

06:16.973 --> 06:20.569
I'm gonna pay you back
with interest.

06:20.744 --> 06:22.644
Okay. You do that.

06:29.386 --> 06:30.876
Thank you, Mr. Bryant

06:55.045 --> 06:56.945
She said that she
played soccer. So I was like...

06:57.114 --> 06:59.742
"You want me to balance
a tricking beer on my foot?"

06:59.816 --> 07:01.944
God, you dumbass.

07:02.319 --> 07:04.549
I got flustered. Get the door.

07:05.489 --> 07:06.649
Wait.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.317
Nice try, hotshot

07:08.592 --> 07:09.616
It's that rent-a-cop.

07:09.693 --> 07:10.683
Shit.

07:11.728 --> 07:13.628
Open the door.

07:16.233 --> 07:17.461
Yes, officer?

07:20.303 --> 07:23.136
I heard a little noise complaint.
Thought I'd come take a look around.

07:23.306 --> 07:25.241
You're gonna need
a search warrant first.

07:25.842 --> 07:27.242
Son, you're gonna
have to take your hands off me.

07:27.310 --> 07:28.539
I'm just taking a little look-see.

07:28.712 --> 07:30.407
You're not even a real cop,
first of all,

07:30.480 --> 07:33.939
and you're not allowed
to search a room without a warrant.

07:34.017 --> 07:35.348
- Boy!
- We pay rent. We pay rent.

07:35.418 --> 07:36.511
It's like we live here, man.

07:36.586 --> 07:37.747
Boy, this is my job.

07:37.821 --> 07:40.552
I'm gonna have to have you
let me do my job, Curlicue.

07:40.624 --> 07:42.421
- And this is our room.
- Yeah.

07:43.059 --> 07:47.019
Are you aware of the notion
of unlawful search and seizure?

07:47.130 --> 07:48.655
Asshole, you're not supposed to
just walk in here.

07:48.732 --> 07:50.529
Keep pushing me. Keep testing me.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.328
- See if you like where it gets you.
- Yeah?

07:55.105 --> 07:56.129
You all right?

07:59.176 --> 08:01.576
What did I say
freshman orientation week?

08:01.645 --> 08:04.478
I said, "No drinking on my campus.11

08:04.748 --> 08:07.877
I don't know why no one called
my attention to your file before.

08:08.051 --> 08:10.281
I mean, all these complaints about you.

08:10.453 --> 08:12.354
Physically assaulting a student.

08:15.258 --> 08:17.727
And have you really been
pulling people over on the highway?

08:18.395 --> 08:21.125
Um, yes, sir, I have.

08:21.298 --> 08:25.132
I figured that if you do
the drunk tests on the road,

08:25.502 --> 08:27.265
trouble never gets to the campus.

08:27.437 --> 08:29.633
We don't have any jurisdiction
on the highway.

08:30.173 --> 08:32.073
And I realize that,

08:32.976 --> 08:35.604
but I believe in law and order, sir.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.871
- You can't have a country without it
- Mmm.

08:38.582 --> 08:41.414
And you were dismissed from the
Habersham County Sheriffs Office.

08:41.885 --> 08:46.516
"I don't want any Mickey-Mousing
on these grounds."

08:46.790 --> 08:48.223
Isn't that what you said?

08:48.625 --> 08:49.854
When did I say that?

08:50.327 --> 08:52.488
You said it at Founders' Day last year,
I believe.

08:52.562 --> 08:54.531
You were by the punch bowl.
I walked up to you,

08:54.598 --> 08:56.361
and you said to me, uh...

08:57.100 --> 08:58.431
Well, I had interrupted you.

08:58.602 --> 09:00.194
I apologized, I introduced myself

09:00.270 --> 09:04.002
and I said I was gonna be the greatest
campus security guard you ever had.

09:04.841 --> 09:06.275
And you said, "That's good.

09:06.843 --> 09:10.279
I don't want any Mickey-Mousing
on this campus.11

09:14.651 --> 09:17.586
I think I mighfve even wrote it down.

09:17.787 --> 09:19.619
I write down most things.

10:29.693 --> 10:31.217
and I get a fucking
Kenny Rogers concert.

10:31.294 --> 10:32.625
It could be worse. Could be equestrian.

10:32.729 --> 10:34.822
- I'm getting my tits done.
- I don't see how that applies here.

10:34.898 --> 10:38.300
This time next year, we're all gonna be
scrambling for jobs on TV.

10:38.568 --> 10:39.933
What do you think, D cup?

10:40.103 --> 10:42.868
I'd miss you, Kathy,
but I don't think they would.

10:45.442 --> 10:48.343
Ladies, I'm sorry my hot-ass murders

10:48.411 --> 10:51.574
keep knocking your boring bullshit
off the front page.

10:51.748 --> 10:53.546
I'm so sorry.

10:53.717 --> 10:54.741
You wanna get a drink?

10:54.918 --> 10:56.112
I'd just slow you down.

10:56.586 --> 10:58.748
Suit yourself.

11:02.192 --> 11:04.183
Yeah, if you think
that's the best thing.

11:06.296 --> 11:07.354
Great.

11:07.430 --> 11:08.454
Uh-huh.

11:12.602 --> 11:14.263
I get to go to Centennial Park.

11:16.506 --> 11:17.769
Watson.

11:25.482 --> 11:26.642
Yeah.

11:26.816 --> 11:28.876
We're out of toner and copy paper.

11:29.719 --> 11:30.550
Um...

11:31.821 --> 11:32.845
Okay.

11:34.891 --> 11:36.655
If I go, you'll have to
answer the phones.

11:38.762 --> 11:40.127
No, I'll go.

11:41.097 --> 11:43.657
There's a sale at the mall. It's 10% off

11:43.833 --> 11:46.427
if you name anyone
from the US Olympic team.

11:46.603 --> 11:47.797
Oh, joy.

11:47.971 --> 11:50.804
I know. People smiling for 16 days.

11:50.874 --> 11:52.364
going to be awful for you.

11:52.642 --> 11:54.940
No, it's gonna be wonderful for CNN,

11:55.011 --> 11:57.105
Coca-Cola, and anybody
with a parking lot.

12:04.954 --> 12:08.686
I can't believe it. It's really here.

12:09.025 --> 12:10.857
Yeah, this is it, Mama.

12:11.661 --> 12:15.530
I do this Olympics gig well,
maybe someone might make me a cop again.

12:16.299 --> 12:17.562
He, in a few days,

12:17.634 --> 12:19.500
will try to become the first man
to ever win Olympic...

12:19.669 --> 12:22.161
Yeah, you just do the best you can.

12:22.338 --> 12:25.035
Hey, I might not move out
until after you've had your surgery.

12:25.108 --> 12:27.235
You might need me for something.
What do you think?

12:27.310 --> 12:29.278
Oh, you go on now.

12:29.345 --> 12:32.281
We got plenty of time to tend to that
after the games are over.

12:33.049 --> 12:36.076
No heavy foot of yours driving there.
No heavy foot.

12:36.152 --> 12:38.451
No heavy foot Yes, ma'am.

12:38.822 --> 12:40.153
And why is that?

12:40.323 --> 12:42.849
Because you'll kill me
if the insurance goes up?

12:43.126 --> 12:44.457
That's right I'd have to kill you.

12:44.527 --> 12:45.620
You'd have to kill me.

12:50.700 --> 12:51.667
Hey, uh...

12:53.102 --> 12:56.300
It's still law enforcement, ain't it?
Even if I'm just

12:57.140 --> 13:00.405
watching over
a bunch of stereo equipment and whatnot?

13:02.011 --> 13:03.070
Heck yeah.

13:03.246 --> 13:06.511
You're still the good guy
ing off the bad guys, aren't

13:10.186 --> 13:11.381
I'll see you later, Mother.

13:11.454 --> 13:13.889
Come on down to the park,
you get bored with yourself.

13:13.990 --> 13:15.583
Have fun.

13:36.279 --> 13:39.943
Muhammad AH, of course
an Olympian, as young Cassius Clay,

13:40.183 --> 13:44.518
gold medal boxer,
1960, the Games of Rome,

13:44.587 --> 13:45.953
What a moment

13:53.696 --> 13:59.362
The opening of the 1996
Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta,

14:03.039 --> 14:07.476
On a warm summer's eve
On a train bound for nowhere

14:08.444 --> 14:13.075
/ met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep

14:13.249 --> 14:15.877
So we took turns a-starin'

14:16.052 --> 14:18.714
Out the window at the darkness

14:18.888 --> 14:23.155
The boredom overtook us
And he began to speak

14:23.459 --> 14:28.898
So / handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow

14:31.601 --> 14:34.502
Anywhere's fine. Thanks, man.

14:34.671 --> 14:35.968
Yeah.

14:37.307 --> 14:38.774
No trouble.

14:39.409 --> 14:42.344
- You guys need anything else?
- No, thanks.

14:42.512 --> 14:44.844
Vail guys need anything,
give me a holler.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.450
You got to know
When to hold 'em

14:48.618 --> 14:51.280
Know when to fold 'em

14:51.454 --> 14:55.789
Know when to walk away, know when to run

14:55.959 --> 14:58.757
You never count your money

14:58.928 --> 15:01.124
When you're sittin'at the table

15:01.297 --> 15:06.326
There'll be time enough forcountin'
When the dealin's done

15:06.502 --> 15:08.095
- You're up close and personal.
- Yeah, I know.

15:08.271 --> 15:09.238
You see him? He's right there.

15:09.305 --> 15:10.272
I can't believe
it's Kenny Rogers!

15:10.473 --> 15:12.271
Know when to fold 'em

15:13.309 --> 15:17.508
Know when to walk away
And know when to run

15:17.680 --> 15:22.948
You never count your money
When you're sittin'at the table

15:23.119 --> 15:25.213
There'll be time enough forcountin'

15:25.388 --> 15:26.719
Hey, Tom.

15:26.889 --> 15:29.051
When the dealin's done

15:29.225 --> 15:31.489
Well, well, well. Hello, Kathy.

15:31.661 --> 15:33.493
Welcome to the happiest place on earth.

15:34.163 --> 15:35.563
Fucking nightmare.

15:36.699 --> 15:39.293
Isn't there anything crime-y
going on anywhere?

15:39.469 --> 15:40.732
How would I know? I'm here.

15:41.537 --> 15:42.903
Christ.

15:43.906 --> 15:46.501
You wanna dance?

15:46.576 --> 15:48.840
I'd love to, but I am on duty.

15:48.911 --> 15:51.039
Oh, fuck duty. Come on.

15:51.814 --> 15:52.804
Might as well.

15:56.219 --> 15:57.277
Excuse me, ma'am.

15:58.688 --> 16:01.316
- You need some water?
- Huh?

16:01.391 --> 16:03.825
Uh, water. It's a warm night

16:04.894 --> 16:06.259
Are you just giving them away?

16:06.429 --> 16:08.727
Yeah, I keep them in here
for police officers,

16:08.798 --> 16:10.857
or when I see a pregnant woman,

16:11.668 --> 16:12.692
-Yeah.

16:12.869 --> 16:14.564
- You have a good night
- You, too.

16:15.938 --> 16:16.928
All right.

16:17.040 --> 16:22.103
You got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em

16:23.212 --> 16:27.445
Know when to walk away
And know when to run

16:29.385 --> 16:30.716
Excuse me, sorry.

16:30.787 --> 16:33.187
You got all these athletes
complaining about

16:33.256 --> 16:36.055
getting to the venues late
on account of the traffic.

16:36.559 --> 16:39.551
But what about the cops?
We can't get anywhere, either.

16:39.629 --> 16:41.256
I had half a mind to
run my siren last night

16:41.330 --> 16:42.491
just to get to the supermarket.

16:42.565 --> 16:44.033
- Mmm-hmm.
- So damn crowded.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.693
It's just poor planning
by the city.

16:45.868 --> 16:48.633
There ain't a one of them jake-legs
got a damn clue about traffic patterns.

16:48.705 --> 16:50.195
- Yeah.
- What do you think, Richard?

16:50.373 --> 16:51.772
Think the city's a bunch of jake-legs?

16:52.442 --> 16:54.876
I don't know. I think, you know,

16:55.044 --> 16:57.911
it's hard coordinating all this
and MARTA and all that

16:57.980 --> 16:59.539
I'm glad I don't have to do it.

16:59.649 --> 17:00.639
Come on.

17:01.317 --> 17:02.307
What?

17:02.485 --> 17:04.613
It's tough, doing all the logistics

17:04.686 --> 17:06.678
and getting everything right.

17:06.989 --> 17:08.787
You see that guy over there
with the ponytail?

17:13.329 --> 17:15.023
Does his backpack look funny to you?

17:17.633 --> 17:18.601
Funny how?

17:18.935 --> 17:21.926
Now, I'm losing him now.
I'll be back, guys.

17:42.091 --> 17:43.218
Excuse me, sir?

17:44.293 --> 17:45.590
Hey, man, how about a cola?

17:45.762 --> 17:47.354
Hey, brother, thanks.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.630
Cheers, dude.

17:55.805 --> 18:00.868
USA! USA! USA!

18:09.719 --> 18:10.879
Yes!

18:26.736 --> 18:27.794
Jesus Christ.

18:29.338 --> 18:30.567
You forgot the turn.

18:32.108 --> 18:34.440
- come on, why so grim, big guy?
- What the fuck is this?

18:34.544 --> 18:37.013
- Because I'm bored. It's boring.
- We're all bored.

18:37.346 --> 18:38.678
These guys aren't bored.

18:40.349 --> 18:42.079
This dance is a real thing, huh?

18:44.053 --> 18:46.886
I just feel like I was made for
something better, you know, than this?

18:46.989 --> 18:48.650
Yeah, you think I wasn't?

19:07.743 --> 19:09.211
To have a little more time
to reflect

19:09.378 --> 19:11.369
I'm writing a book right now,
not about myself...

19:11.681 --> 19:13.877
My, my, he sure is handsome.

19:15.451 --> 19:18.387
You sure you don't want a sandwich
or anything?

19:20.223 --> 19:23.920
No, Mama, I'm not feeling well.
It's my stomach.

19:24.227 --> 19:25.717
Something you ate?

19:26.362 --> 19:27.523
Yeah, I guess so.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.955
I was in the bathroom all morni

19:31.267 --> 19:33.998
Why you eat that fast food junk?

19:36.772 --> 19:38.035
What is wrong, Richard?

19:40.076 --> 19:43.341
I just look around this place
and I just think

19:43.446 --> 19:45.471
the world owes you
better than this, Mama.

19:46.816 --> 19:49.251
Shoot, the world owes us both.

19:49.418 --> 19:51.080
This is what we got

19:51.254 --> 19:52.721
Go do your job, son.

19:54.657 --> 19:56.386
Oh, God.

20:00.162 --> 20:01.562
Okay, now.

20:10.907 --> 20:12.431
Yo, Atlanta!

20:14.110 --> 20:15.339
How you feeli

20:16.512 --> 20:18.742
You feeling all right?
Say, "Yeah!"

20:19.515 --> 20:20.607
Listen.

20:21.851 --> 20:24.183
/ know a place

20:26.022 --> 20:28.957
Ain't nobody cryin'

20:30.126 --> 20:31.992
This could be a good thing.

20:32.061 --> 20:33.426
How's this a good thing?

20:33.930 --> 20:36.330
We could bring you out
to the diving venue.

20:36.499 --> 20:38.490
We could have you fart
the national anthem,

20:38.668 --> 20:40.363
Do not make me laugh right now.

20:41.671 --> 20:43.639
Why don't you switch shifts
with someone? Go home.

20:44.840 --> 20:46.502
This is my favorite band.

20:47.777 --> 20:49.370
Jack Mack is your favorite band?

20:49.545 --> 20:50.979
I'm not leaving. I'm fine.

20:51.147 --> 20:52.205
All right.

20:53.983 --> 20:55.178
I'll be right back.

20:55.351 --> 20:56.511
Go.

21:04.527 --> 21:05.551
Whoo-hoo!

21:05.628 --> 21:07.653
- Look, Mom, I'm Kerri Strug.
- Do that again.

21:07.830 --> 21:08.695
Nice.

21:08.798 --> 21:09.697
Who are you?

21:09.865 --> 21:11.390
Dad, look, I'm Mitch Gaylord.

21:12.735 --> 21:13.861
That's awesome.

21:14.036 --> 21:15.060
Come on, let's go get some ice cream.

21:15.237 --> 21:17.069
- Yeah.
- Okay, guys, enough gymnastics.

21:18.207 --> 21:20.676
Ain't nobody cryin'

21:22.511 --> 21:24.707
Ain't nobody worried

21:26.749 --> 21:29.741
Ain't no smilin' faces

21:29.919 --> 21:31.182
No, no, no

21:31.354 --> 21:33.345
Lyin' to the races

21:34.190 --> 21:37.023
Come on, now
Lyin' to the races

21:38.594 --> 21:41.996
/ say now
Lyin' to the races

21:47.236 --> 21:48.670
Excuse me.

21:48.838 --> 21:50.533
Vail better stop what you're doing.

21:50.706 --> 21:52.003
Right now.

21:52.908 --> 21:54.934
What's going on, lard and in charge?

21:55.011 --> 21:56.876
This fucking guy!

21:57.747 --> 21:59.772
Yeah, what are you gonna do,
cancel my phone service?

21:59.949 --> 22:01.746
Yeah, let me tell you
something, hotshot.

22:01.917 --> 22:05.251
The police, they're not gonna
ask you as nicely.

22:05.421 --> 22:07.856
They see the drunk and disorderly,

22:08.024 --> 22:10.720
that's cuffs and a night in the lockup.

22:10.893 --> 22:12.224
He's threatening us.

22:13.362 --> 22:15.524
You're gonna have to
catch me first, lard-ass.

22:16.799 --> 22:19.530
You think you're faster
than a cop car, son?

22:19.702 --> 22:21.431
- Yeah.
- You think you're that fast, roadrunner?

22:21.604 --> 22:23.367
Yeah, I'm Michael Johnson, okay?

22:23.539 --> 22:24.973
The fastest man on earth.

22:25.574 --> 22:26.803
You wanna see my medals?

22:27.376 --> 22:29.242
He's got medals. He'll show them to you.

22:29.412 --> 22:30.401
- I can show them to you.
- He'll prove it

22:30.579 --> 22:31.569
Dude, where are you going?

22:32.448 --> 22:33.745
Come on.

22:34.817 --> 22:36.285
You just wait. You wait.

22:36.719 --> 22:38.414
Yeah, bye-bye.

22:39.488 --> 22:40.319
Nice.

22:40.756 --> 22:42.725
Who the fuck left this monstrosity?

22:42.892 --> 22:44.826
- It's like some...
- Gl Joe.

22:45.795 --> 22:46.784
It's heavy.

22:47.930 --> 22:48.920
I think we should take it.

22:49.098 --> 22:50.395
Yes.

22:52.301 --> 22:53.735
Excuse me.

22:53.903 --> 22:57.236
Hey, guys. We got some drunk guys
breaking bottles against the tower.

22:57.406 --> 22:58.601
They're not listening to me.

22:58.774 --> 23:00.333
Maybe they'll listen to you.

23:00.810 --> 23:02.334
People respect the badge.

23:04.180 --> 23:05.670
I think we should take it down
to the House of Blues

23:05.748 --> 23:06.977
and see how much we can get for it

23:07.049 --> 23:08.016
That's a clutch idea.

23:08.084 --> 23:09.483
Hey! Get away from there.
Go on! Get off it.

23:09.785 --> 23:11.014
What you all doing?

23:11.087 --> 23:12.247
Go on, get outta here!

23:14.690 --> 23:16.784
- Hey, you guys. See if...
- Go on. Run home to Mommy.

23:16.959 --> 23:20.293
Hey, see if they left a backpack
under my bench.

23:21.330 --> 23:22.627
Atlanta 911.

23:22.932 --> 23:24.627
Can you understand me?

23:25.468 --> 23:26.696
Yes, Go ahead.

23:27.336 --> 23:29.304
You defy the order of the militia

23:30.272 --> 23:31.205
What?

23:34.443 --> 23:35.877
I got another weird one.

23:38.948 --> 23:40.438
Well,
it ain't theirs, Richard.

23:40.616 --> 23:41.879
I don't like this.

23:44.186 --> 23:47.918
We got ourselves a suspicious package.
We better call it in.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.884
Probably just somebody run off drunk
and forgot they left it.

23:51.060 --> 23:53.085
I still think we ought to call it in.

23:53.629 --> 23:54.926
Just take it to lost and found, Richard.

23:54.997 --> 23:56.829
Shouldn't we unzip it,
and see what's inside first?

23:56.899 --> 23:58.958
No, no, you don't wanna touch that.

24:00.169 --> 24:01.728
You got to follow protocol.

24:01.904 --> 24:04.805
Son of a bitch had to get left
under your bench, didn't it?

24:05.174 --> 24:07.302
We need assistance
on an unclaimed bag-

24:07.476 --> 24:08.842
A suspicious package.

24:09.011 --> 24:11.673
A suspicious package
over at section four.

24:11.847 --> 24:14.282
We ought to set up
some kind of a perimeter, too.

24:14.350 --> 24:15.374
- Just back away.
- Perimeter?

24:15.551 --> 24:16.711
Richard, you crazy?

24:18.254 --> 24:22.054
You know what? I would rather be crazy
than wrong right now.

24:23.359 --> 24:25.555
Shit, Richard. It's just full of beer.

24:25.728 --> 24:27.025
take you there

24:27.196 --> 24:29.927
Yo
Somebody help me now, y'all

24:30.099 --> 24:31.498
/'// take you there
Break it down, break it down

24:33.702 --> 24:35.466
Hey, guys,
there's a situation downstairs.

24:35.538 --> 24:36.971
We're gonna have to get you outta here.

24:37.039 --> 24:38.200
What kind of situation?

24:38.374 --> 24:41.207
Well, we're looking at a suspicious
package in front of the tower.

24:41.277 --> 24:43.507
Law enforcement is aware
and they're on the scene.

24:43.579 --> 24:46.446
Well, if the cops tell us
we gotta go, we'll go.

24:46.515 --> 24:48.950
The band's in the middle of a set.
We can't just shut down.

24:49.018 --> 24:50.508
Yeah, you know what,
if I have to come back here,

24:50.619 --> 24:52.849
there's gonna be no questions
and no hesitation.

24:56.258 --> 24:57.282
Hey, guys.

24:57.459 --> 25:00.054
We got a bomb scare
in front of the tower.

25:00.162 --> 25:01.220
You should be aware of that.

25:01.297 --> 25:04.266
We get bomb threats all the time in DC.
They're never anything.

25:04.466 --> 25:06.093
Cool for you. I'm out of here.

25:08.971 --> 25:10.131
You got anything?

25:12.474 --> 25:14.306
Local cop discovered yesterday

25:14.376 --> 25:17.835
he's actually second cousins
with a Polish gymnast

25:18.147 --> 25:19.376
Is that a story?

25:20.115 --> 25:21.708
Doesn't get me hard.

25:22.384 --> 25:23.545
Me, neither.

25:27.656 --> 25:28.749
You look nice.

25:28.824 --> 25:29.985
Oh, thanks.

25:32.895 --> 25:34.294
Do you have a lighter?

25:34.630 --> 25:35.893
You know I don't smoke.

25:36.899 --> 25:39.493
All right, I'm gonna go find a lighter.
I'll be back.

25:39.735 --> 25:40.725
Those'll kill ya.

25:40.803 --> 25:42.737
Well, gotta die of something.

25:42.805 --> 25:43.931
Not today.

25:47.443 --> 25:50.435
Silver, still got 11 people inside.

25:51.080 --> 25:52.843
I made them aware of everything.

25:53.015 --> 25:54.608
We're not evacuating just yet

25:54.783 --> 25:57.116
Listen, you know this is a false alarm.

25:57.286 --> 25:59.550
- Okay? Calm down.
- You gentlemen looking for the package?

25:59.622 --> 26:01.385
- Yeah. What have we got?
- Follow me.

26:01.490 --> 26:04.187
Right down here.
Excuse us, coming through.

26:04.493 --> 26:05.517
Excuse me.

26:05.961 --> 26:07.122
Atlanta 911.

26:07.463 --> 26:09.954
There's a bomb in Centennial Park.

26:10.633 --> 26:11.463
What?

26:11.667 --> 26:13.157
You have 30 minutes.

26:17.439 --> 26:19.203
Do you know the address
of Centennial Park?

26:21.443 --> 26:22.604
I'm gonna need you
to move forward.

26:22.778 --> 26:25.008
Excuse me, folks.
Excuse me, if you could move in.

26:25.180 --> 26:26.614
I need you boys to get off the bench.

26:26.682 --> 26:27.672
I'm getting tired, Mom.

26:27.750 --> 26:29.183
- Guys, get up, please.
- Yeah, me, too.

26:29.251 --> 26:31.276
I need you ladies
to move off that bench.

26:31.453 --> 26:32.443
Come join us.

26:32.521 --> 26:33.921
Let's get the last of these pictures
and we'll go home.

26:33.989 --> 26:34.820
Okay.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.252
Move this way.

26:36.458 --> 26:37.721
Right there.

26:41.130 --> 26:43.121
I don't know how long it's been there.

27:47.830 --> 27:50.663
Oh, Lord. They told us in training.

27:50.733 --> 27:51.563
It's real.

27:51.633 --> 27:55.365
"You ever see the bomb guy
go pale, run.11

28:00.209 --> 28:02.678
We got three pipe bombs in that bag.
Biggest I've ever seen.

28:02.745 --> 28:04.645
We need to clear
a 100-foot perimeter immediately.

28:04.713 --> 28:06.272
Vail got a bomb blanket?

28:06.348 --> 28:08.339
The Render-Safe team
can be here in 20 minutes.

28:08.650 --> 28:09.709
Richard...

28:10.152 --> 28:12.416
I'm never giving you shit
about anything ever again.

28:12.488 --> 28:13.921
- All right, we need to move!
- All right, back up.

28:13.989 --> 28:16.515
- Everybody back now.
- Everyone, start moving forward, please!

28:16.592 --> 28:19.459
Everybody, we need you to help us out.
Away from the tower, please.

28:19.628 --> 28:20.891
Move forward!

28:21.063 --> 28:24.499
Folks, we're gonna need you to help
secure a perimeter.

28:24.666 --> 28:27.295
We need you to move forward,
please! Right now!

28:27.903 --> 28:29.337
Smile.

28:29.505 --> 28:30.631
Please, move forward.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.300
Move forward, please!

28:32.474 --> 28:34.306
These people on the end,
ease back.

28:34.476 --> 28:35.466
Keep moving.

28:38.113 --> 28:39.911
I blinked. Take another one.

28:41.817 --> 28:44.787
Start moving down that way.
Clear out.

28:44.853 --> 28:45.843
Left, right, left, right.

28:46.021 --> 28:47.785
Move forward, please.

28:48.357 --> 28:50.348
Please, everyone's fine.

28:50.526 --> 28:51.584
Keep moving.

28:51.760 --> 28:54.093
Go back. Keep moving. Watch your step.

28:54.263 --> 28:55.856
We need your help right now.
Do not worry.

28:56.031 --> 28:59.160
Keep it moving, please.
Ma'am, keep it moving.

28:59.268 --> 29:00.997
Thank you. Keep it moving. Thank you.

29:01.303 --> 29:02.828
- This way. Come on.
- Nice and safe.

29:03.005 --> 29:04.632
Be careful of that bench right there.

29:04.873 --> 29:07.433
Hey! We've gotta go right now!

29:08.343 --> 29:11.211
We've got a bomb! Get out right now!

29:11.380 --> 29:13.041
Downstairs right now!

29:14.850 --> 29:19.219
Keep moving! Everybody, watch where
you're stepping, please. Be careful.

29:19.455 --> 29:20.285
Excuse me.

29:20.456 --> 29:22.720
Guys, we have got to evacuate!

29:22.891 --> 29:24.518
Hey! Are you listening to me?

29:24.693 --> 29:27.890
We gotta evacuate the tower!
We have a bomb! Right now!

29:28.063 --> 29:29.292
A little closer to the stage.
Sorry.

29:29.465 --> 29:31.695
Just come a little further away
from the tower, everybody.

29:31.934 --> 29:34.198
Guys, we gotta go right now. Come on.

29:35.370 --> 29:38.238
We got a bomb! You've gotta go now!

29:38.407 --> 29:40.500
You afraid you're gonna miss
the Jack Mack concert?

29:40.676 --> 29:42.974
Come on! Get down there right now!

29:43.145 --> 29:44.169
We got a bomb!

29:46.682 --> 29:48.343
Come on, guys. We gotta move!

29:49.017 --> 29:50.679
Move, move, move, move, move!

29:50.853 --> 29:53.822
Get the lead outta your pants!
Come on now!

30:02.231 --> 30:03.323
Building's all clear.

30:03.499 --> 30:04.830
You should get out of here, Richard.

30:05.234 --> 30:06.667
- Yeah, you, too.
- Go.

30:06.835 --> 30:08.530
Guys, move away from the tower!

30:08.704 --> 30:10.262
- Come on, move away from the tower!
- We have to leave the whole area?

30:10.439 --> 30:11.429
What is happening?

30:11.607 --> 30:13.871
Go toward the street! Anything but here!

30:14.076 --> 30:15.441
Are you kidding me?

30:15.611 --> 30:17.238
We got to move! There's a bomb...

30:33.896 --> 30:34.885
You two all right?

30:35.063 --> 30:36.190
Yeah, I think so.

30:47.609 --> 30:48.576
Mom.

30:53.048 --> 30:54.948
Come on, this way. Let's go.

31:10.132 --> 31:11.292
Come on, darli

31:11.366 --> 31:12.766
Let's go.

31:14.002 --> 31:14.992
You run out

31:17.139 --> 31:18.129
Oh, God.

31:19.174 --> 31:20.608
Hey, hey!

31:21.610 --> 31:23.339
Hey. You all right?

31:23.779 --> 31:24.803
How bad?

31:24.980 --> 31:25.947
I'm fine.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.278
- I'm fine.
- All right

31:28.450 --> 31:29.747
You're gonna be all right, brother.

31:29.818 --> 31:31.513
Help's on the way. Don't move.

31:32.321 --> 31:34.346
Can we get some
medical over here, please?

31:39.761 --> 31:43.197
Move them back!
There could be a second device!

31:44.032 --> 31:45.500
Let's go. Keep it movi

31:45.667 --> 31:46.657
Let's go. Keep it movi

31:47.936 --> 31:49.267
Right now.

31:49.438 --> 31:51.304
Several people down. We need assistance.

31:51.473 --> 31:52.634
We need it right now!

31:53.942 --> 31:57.139
Keep moving. Follow these arrows.

32:00.782 --> 32:01.715
Mom?

32:06.788 --> 32:08.586
A Team,
there was an explosion.

32:08.657 --> 32:10.455
Send as many ambulances as you have.

32:10.626 --> 32:12.150
Hang on. I'm gonna need help.

33:35.610 --> 33:40.412
And please, whoever he is,
let him be fucking interesting.

33:40.816 --> 33:42.079
Amen.

34:00.602 --> 34:01.592
Are you Jewell?

34:02.571 --> 34:05.597
- Uh, yes. Yes, sir.
- I'm Tim Barker, AT&T Media Relations.

34:05.674 --> 34:08.109
Did I hear this right?
You're the one who discovered the bomb?

34:08.176 --> 34:09.303
Yes, sir, I did.

34:09.377 --> 34:11.072
That makes you a hero, you know that?

34:11.146 --> 34:12.773
I was just doing my job, sir.

34:12.848 --> 34:14.315
That's a nice thing to say, Richard,

34:14.382 --> 34:17.284
but we're getting requests from a lot
of people who wanna talk to you.

34:17.351 --> 34:18.752
Would that be okay?

34:19.054 --> 34:21.523
CNN, Katie Couric, those types.

34:21.590 --> 34:22.887
Your superior gave the okay.

34:22.958 --> 34:26.326
I gotta tell ya, there were a whole
bunch of folks clearing people out.

34:26.428 --> 34:28.623
Police personnel, medics.
It wasn't just me.

34:28.697 --> 34:30.096
You're the one who spotted the package.

34:30.165 --> 34:32.360
You're the one
people wanna hear from, okay?

34:32.534 --> 34:35.060
Can we get you something to drink,
take care of you?

34:35.170 --> 34:36.763
I could use a cup of coffee

34:36.838 --> 34:39.137
- if they're gonna make me speak on TV.
- Sure. Absolutely.

34:41.409 --> 34:42.877
With us now is Richard Jewell,

34:42.978 --> 34:46.710
the security guard who first spotted
that knapsack that contained the bomb

34:46.782 --> 34:48.716
and began clearing people away
before it exploded.

34:48.784 --> 34:50.445
- Richard Jewell, welcome,
- Thank you.

34:50.719 --> 34:53.210
A lot of people are calling you a hero.
Do you feel like one?

34:53.288 --> 34:55.222
No, ma'am, I feel like, uh,

34:55.389 --> 34:58.826
/ was a person that did the job
that I was supposed to do.

34:58.994 --> 35:00.985
/ was in the right place
at the right time

35:01.830 --> 35:04.458
and used my training
in the way I was taught

35:04.633 --> 35:08.535
The real heroes are
the paramedics and the firemen,

35:08.703 --> 35:10.296
all the agents that placed themselves

35:10.472 --> 35:15.467
between the bomb and the people
that were refusing to move

35:15.544 --> 35:18.069
because they took
most of the shrapnel themselves.

35:18.146 --> 35:19.307
Good for you, Radar.

35:19.381 --> 35:20.371
You played a big role.

35:20.448 --> 35:22.246
You were in the right place at the
right time and you did the right thing.

35:22.384 --> 35:24.079
Thank you very much,
I really appreciate that

35:24.152 --> 35:25.244
Thanks so much
for coming in.

35:25.320 --> 35:26.845
Thank you for having me,
I appreciate it

35:27.022 --> 35:29.582
And we'll be back with more
from Atlanta right after this.

35:30.025 --> 35:31.185
My boy.

35:35.063 --> 35:36.155
Find it.

35:37.365 --> 35:39.391
That's it. Find it.

35:44.539 --> 35:46.200
Right here. We got one.

35:50.212 --> 35:51.770
How'd you feel
about that one, Richard?

35:51.847 --> 35:54.543
I think it went well.
It was...

35:54.616 --> 35:57.517
Everybody was really nice.
Made me feel okay about it.

35:57.586 --> 35:59.281
- Yeah. You were great,
- Good job, Richard.

35:59.554 --> 36:00.612
Hey, thank you.

36:00.789 --> 36:02.052
Hey, I had a question for y'all.

36:02.123 --> 36:05.218
I worked with some guys
who got injured last night.

36:05.760 --> 36:07.194
Green, Silver, Miller.

36:07.362 --> 36:08.955
You know if they made it out all right?

36:09.130 --> 36:11.964
Yeah. Word is all the cops
are gonna make a full recovery.

36:12.801 --> 36:15.395
- That's great Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

36:15.470 --> 36:17.029
Richard, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

36:17.105 --> 36:19.073
This is Mr. Brenner
from Bernstein and Crane.

36:19.140 --> 36:20.733
You know the company,
they publish books.

36:20.876 --> 36:22.343
Uh, nice to meet you, sir.

36:22.410 --> 36:24.242
Hello, Richard. Pleasure to meet you.

36:24.379 --> 36:26.313
I would like to talk
to you about your story.

36:26.481 --> 36:27.642
Are you free?

36:29.251 --> 36:31.446
- Uh... Am I free? Can I talk to him?
- Sure. Sure.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.417
All right. Let's get a cup of coffee.

36:33.588 --> 36:35.215
Better yet, let's get something to eat.

36:35.991 --> 36:38.790
You're not gonna hear a complaint
out of me for that.

36:38.960 --> 36:39.950
Let's get you something good.

36:41.596 --> 36:43.895
No, no, no. I gotta go. I gotta go.

36:46.101 --> 36:47.159
Richard.

36:47.335 --> 36:48.826
Oh, my Lord.

36:49.004 --> 36:50.562
You're everywhere.

36:50.739 --> 36:53.799
I mean, the phone has just been
ringing off the hook.

36:54.476 --> 36:55.841
I need a secretary.

36:56.011 --> 36:58.172
Yeah, I think I might
need a secretary, too.

36:58.346 --> 37:02.306
Some guy from New York
just asked me if I wanna write a book.

37:02.484 --> 37:04.111
You don't mean it

37:04.286 --> 37:05.810
No, I'm not kidding you.

37:05.987 --> 37:08.422
They tell me, apparently...

37:08.590 --> 37:09.785
Oh, Lord.

37:09.958 --> 37:13.724
Apparently, they got somebody who
they think up all the stuff in the book,

37:13.795 --> 37:15.889
they type it out
and then they just ask you,

37:15.964 --> 37:18.797
"yes or no," "true or false/1
"did it happen?" Then they pay you.

37:18.967 --> 37:20.196
You do that for money.

37:20.368 --> 37:21.961
Oh, my God, you're a rock star.

37:22.137 --> 37:25.300
Tom Brokaw was even talking about you.

37:26.875 --> 37:28.365
I can't even think right now.

37:28.543 --> 37:31.672
Are you all right?
You've been up for so long.

37:31.846 --> 37:35.078
- Oh, my God, it was so horrible.
- Mama, I'm sorry. I didn't even hug you.

37:35.183 --> 37:37.914
- It was so awful. Awful.
- I know, I was there.

37:38.720 --> 37:39.812
Oh, my God.

37:39.988 --> 37:42.184
Be thankful that you weren't there.

37:42.357 --> 37:44.120
- You could have been there.
- I know.

37:44.225 --> 37:45.921
- I couldn't have handled that.
- No.

37:46.027 --> 37:48.155
You were there two nights ago
for Kenny Rogers.

37:48.229 --> 37:49.390
Can you imagine
if you were there last night?

37:49.464 --> 37:51.296
I know. I know. Sit down. Sit down.

37:51.366 --> 37:54.097
You must be really hungry.
I'm gonna give you some food.

37:54.469 --> 37:56.301
Oh, my goodness.

37:56.604 --> 37:58.869
Oh, Mama, I'm telling you what...

38:00.742 --> 38:03.336
It was complete chaos, Mama.

38:03.645 --> 38:06.307
And to think I could've called in sick.

38:06.481 --> 38:08.506
Think about how I was feeling yesterday.

38:08.683 --> 38:10.708
- I know.
- I could've called in sick.

38:10.885 --> 38:12.080
I know.

38:12.887 --> 38:14.150
- Then what?
- Oh, my Lord.

38:15.256 --> 38:16.747
Shaw.

38:17.192 --> 38:18.557
- No, I gotta go.
- Doing okay?

38:19.361 --> 38:20.350
No.

38:21.363 --> 38:23.024
That bomb went off on my watch.

38:23.198 --> 38:24.563
That's my fucking park.

38:25.166 --> 38:28.500
We didn't have enough eyeballs there.
That's on us.

38:29.571 --> 38:31.164
Let's just catch
the son of a bitch, yeah?

38:31.740 --> 38:32.707
Yeah.

38:33.108 --> 38:35.167
I need you to get out
to Habersham County.

38:35.343 --> 38:36.834
Background on a former sheriffs deputy.

38:37.012 --> 38:38.570
Might have some connection
to the bombing.

38:39.080 --> 38:40.070
Who is it?

38:40.915 --> 38:42.406
The security guard.

38:55.063 --> 38:56.189
Hey, Richard!

39:00.802 --> 39:02.531
Hey, way to go, man.

39:02.604 --> 39:04.037
You made us all real proud.

39:06.041 --> 39:07.099
Thank you.

39:11.546 --> 39:15.312
Dr. Cleere, we wanna thank you
for contacting the FBI

39:15.383 --> 39:18.751
regarding your suspicions
about Richard Jewell.

39:19.087 --> 39:22.546
I want to be clear,
I haven't accused him of anything.

39:22.724 --> 39:24.089
We completely understand.

39:24.859 --> 39:25.690
I just...

39:27.729 --> 39:30.460
I see the attention he's getting.

39:30.632 --> 39:33.123
It's the kind of attention
he was always seeking here.

39:33.501 --> 39:36.130
Harassing students,
pulling people over on the highway.

39:36.204 --> 39:37.171
Just crazy behavior.

39:38.440 --> 39:40.431
And I decided if my fears were correct,

39:40.508 --> 39:43.740
if he actually wasn't the hero
they're making him out to be,

39:43.912 --> 39:45.880
and I had information
pertinent to the fact,

39:45.947 --> 39:48.279
which I failed to bring to light,

39:48.783 --> 39:50.080
it could jeopardize lives.

39:51.453 --> 39:53.853
Well, Dr. Cleere, you did
the right thing in calling us.

39:54.022 --> 39:57.014
We will, rest assured,
follow up on this.

39:57.592 --> 39:58.821
Do you mind if we
take this folder with us?

39:58.893 --> 39:59.724
Please.

39:59.861 --> 40:01.989
We'll make a copy
and get you the original back.

40:02.831 --> 40:06.289
Why is the goddamn ACOG
reopening that park?

40:06.468 --> 40:07.867
We don't have shit!

40:09.871 --> 40:12.499
Okay, I wanna hear more about Jewell.

40:12.674 --> 40:13.800
Patrick?

40:14.309 --> 40:15.503
All right.

40:15.777 --> 40:17.973
Well, when I look at Jewell,

40:18.146 --> 40:21.946
I think about the bomb scare
at the LA Olympics in '84.

40:22.450 --> 40:25.511
A bag left on a bus by the same cop
who then discovered it

40:25.954 --> 40:28.047
And the fires in Idaho this summer

40:28.123 --> 40:32.025
started by a firefighter who wanted
the credit for putting them out.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.124
A profile emerges here.

40:34.996 --> 40:36.293
The false hero.

40:37.232 --> 40:39.792
In interviews, Jewell's account
of the bombing seems vague

40:40.001 --> 40:42.971
and he looks uncomfortable
discussing the victims.

40:43.138 --> 40:45.971
I also found that his mentioning on TV

40:46.040 --> 40:50.000
that he wanted to get back into
law enforcement a bit inappropriate.

40:50.545 --> 40:52.070
There's a lot here that's troubli

40:52.147 --> 40:54.638
And everything that Agent Shaw
has learned about him

40:54.716 --> 40:56.183
syncs up with this profile.

40:59.053 --> 41:00.680
You agree with that, Tom?

41:01.322 --> 41:02.688
Yes, sir, I do.

41:07.395 --> 41:09.056
Let's put eyes on him.

41:13.835 --> 41:15.268
- Watson?
- Yeah?

41:15.436 --> 41:17.098
-Yeah.

41:22.243 --> 41:23.438
If so, that's an affirmative.

41:23.511 --> 41:24.706
It's Richard Jewell.

41:27.615 --> 41:29.276
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell?

41:29.417 --> 41:31.408
"Richard Jewell" Richard Jewell,
line one.

41:34.589 --> 41:35.419
Hello?

41:35.790 --> 41:37.383
Mr. Bryant

41:37.559 --> 41:40.050
Hey, I'm sorry to bother you.

41:40.128 --> 41:42.528
I just got your number from Information.

41:43.364 --> 41:44.798
I hope you remember me.

41:45.099 --> 41:48.695
Radar, you can call me Watson.
You're a national hero now.

41:48.870 --> 41:51.066
I'm glad you called.
We're running out of Snickers,

41:51.239 --> 41:54.402
Thank you, sir. How are you?
How's your family?

41:54.576 --> 41:57.067
we're all fine, yeah, yeah.

41:57.245 --> 41:59.611
/ see you've moved up from video games.

41:59.781 --> 42:03.308
Yep. Yeah, I didn't mean to,
but I guess I did.

42:03.651 --> 42:07.110
Good job. That's a prideful thing.
What can I... What can I do you for?

42:07.522 --> 42:08.751
Sir, I was calling you

42:08.957 --> 42:12.324
because I wanted to know,
have you ever done a book deal?

42:13.027 --> 42:15.223
What, uh... Why?

42:15.430 --> 42:18.092
With this whole bomb thing,
I got these New York guys

42:18.266 --> 42:19.893
who are asking me to write a book

42:20.068 --> 42:22.400
and I don't really know
anything about that.

42:22.570 --> 42:25.062
So I thought maybe I could call you,
you might be able to help me.

42:25.139 --> 42:27.335
Sure, Sounds a little far-fetched,

42:27.609 --> 42:31.943
but contracts are contracts,
but, yeah, we could talk.

42:32.647 --> 42:35.241
So, are you not the US
Small Business Admin anymore?

42:35.416 --> 42:36.782
'Cause I tried there first

42:36.951 --> 42:38.317
No, I moved on.

42:38.620 --> 42:39.712
Oh. How come?

42:39.787 --> 42:41.517
Lifestyle decision.

42:42.090 --> 42:43.580
What's your phone number?

42:44.492 --> 42:46.187
My phone number is 404...

42:46.261 --> 42:47.091
404...

42:47.262 --> 42:49.457
- 194...
- 194...

42:49.631 --> 42:51.929
- 8188.
- 8188.

42:52.100 --> 42:54.500
All right, well,
you just don't sign anything

42:54.669 --> 42:57.138
until I see it first. We'll start there.

42:57.305 --> 42:58.363
Yes, sir.

42:58.539 --> 43:01.634
Yeah, I won't put a pen to the page.
I'll wait on it.

43:02.477 --> 43:04.968
Hey, and thank you, sir.
Thank you for your time.

43:05.146 --> 43:06.136
You got it

43:06.314 --> 43:07.440
All right, bye.

43:07.615 --> 43:08.844
- Stay in touch.
- Yes, sir.

43:09.017 --> 43:10.484
- Okay.
- Bye,

43:15.790 --> 43:16.951
No, no.

43:17.125 --> 43:19.685
Don't get too excited.

43:21.162 --> 43:22.527
- No.
- Yes.

43:22.697 --> 43:25.098
No. Simmer down there, hot sauce.

43:27.802 --> 43:29.827
Well, Bill Miller.

43:30.004 --> 43:32.405
It's nice to see you. It's been a while.

43:32.573 --> 43:34.041
It's nice to see you, Bobi.

43:34.208 --> 43:35.232
Where's the hero?

43:35.610 --> 43:37.635
Oh, he's in here. Come on in.

43:43.017 --> 43:44.951
What kind of charge
you figure it was?

43:45.019 --> 43:45.850
Mmm.

43:47.855 --> 43:50.552
I'm not sure what kind of explosive
the guy used.

43:50.725 --> 43:54.525
It could have been
black powder, match heads,

43:55.096 --> 43:58.157
maybe some kind of
chlorate packed with nails.

43:58.366 --> 44:03.895
You know, the funny thing is the package
was supposed to blow out, right?

44:04.072 --> 44:07.371
So, when those drunks,
those kids knocked it over,

44:07.542 --> 44:09.339
they saved a bunch of lives.

44:09.644 --> 44:14.240
Because it was supposed to blow out
into a crowd for maximum casualties.

44:14.349 --> 44:17.079
But when they knocked it on its back,
it blew upward.

44:17.251 --> 44:19.447
Most of the ordnance
going up into the sky.

44:20.388 --> 44:21.856
It blew up.

44:23.024 --> 44:25.618
So, all in all, what you're looking at
is some kind of battery,

44:25.693 --> 44:29.129
and some kind of timing device,
like a simple clock.

44:29.297 --> 44:31.766
Maybe awristwatch like I'm wearing.

44:31.933 --> 44:34.299
Depends how high-tech the guy got.

44:34.569 --> 44:37.129
Some of these guys,
especially if they're ex-military

44:37.205 --> 44:40.538
or they're some kind of whiz
out of some university,

44:40.708 --> 44:43.769
they're gonna use a combination
of different bomb tactics.

44:43.945 --> 44:46.607
Other people are following it
like a recipe.

44:46.781 --> 44:49.716
- They're probably losing a finger to it
- Yeah.

44:49.884 --> 44:54.378
But depends on who you're talking about
and who's making the bomb.

44:54.555 --> 44:55.613
Well...

44:55.790 --> 44:57.224
I like getting your opinion on it,

44:57.291 --> 44:59.590
and I'm sure
you've studied it quite a bit.

44:59.894 --> 45:01.453
- Who knows?
- Mmm-hmm.

45:01.896 --> 45:03.591
That's the thing, too,
about these bombers.

45:03.664 --> 45:05.394
It could have been you or me.

45:05.666 --> 45:08.829
These guys, some of them,
look like regular people.

45:09.003 --> 45:10.471
Lot of them do.

45:14.075 --> 45:15.133
Yeah.

45:38.433 --> 45:40.867
Must be a lot of pressure on you guys.

45:42.470 --> 45:43.835
No more so than usual.

45:45.106 --> 45:46.665
Sure, just another... Thank you.

45:47.508 --> 45:51.468
Just your average deadly bombing
on US soil during the Olympics.

45:51.646 --> 45:52.875
No big deal.

45:54.382 --> 45:56.680
I don't know, you guys must be
feeling the heat, too, huh?

45:56.751 --> 45:57.581
Mmm-hmm.

45:58.319 --> 46:00.048
CNN is going wall-to-wall with this.

46:00.121 --> 46:01.782
Is that why we get this

46:01.956 --> 46:03.117
outfit?

46:05.059 --> 46:06.527
So, then give me something I can print.

46:08.930 --> 46:10.796
Kathy, you know I can't do that.

46:11.999 --> 46:14.332
That's all right. I already know
the Bureau's looking into somebody.

46:14.402 --> 46:16.131
Yeah, what makes you think that?

46:17.004 --> 46:17.994
Friends.

46:18.172 --> 46:19.196
- Friends?
- Sources.

46:19.373 --> 46:20.397
Sources?

46:22.343 --> 46:23.640
Who is it?

46:25.546 --> 46:27.571
Well, Kathy, if you couldn't
fuck it out of them,

46:27.648 --> 46:29.742
what makes you think
you're gonna fuck it outta me?

46:33.754 --> 46:36.155
You know what bothers me, Kathy,
is that people don't understand

46:36.224 --> 46:38.124
how much work goes into
making a case like this.

46:38.192 --> 46:40.354
It's effort 24/7.

46:41.128 --> 46:41.959
Hmm.

46:42.430 --> 46:43.727
You're right

46:47.768 --> 46:49.498
Why don't you educate me?

46:51.672 --> 46:54.266
I will not have this screwed up.

46:54.442 --> 46:55.739
That was a massacre out there.

46:55.810 --> 46:57.278
It's a miracle
more people weren't killed.

46:57.445 --> 46:58.742
I would never go to print

46:58.813 --> 47:01.543
without independent corroboration
from a second source.

47:01.616 --> 47:04.676
And that would put us
in a very different zone.

47:07.021 --> 47:08.352
As you know.

47:10.591 --> 47:11.786
Really?

47:11.859 --> 47:12.917
Mmm-hmm.

47:13.728 --> 47:14.957
What kind of zone?

47:15.696 --> 47:17.130
You have to find out

47:30.945 --> 47:34.108
We're looking at
the security guard, Jewell.

47:37.585 --> 47:39.144
- No shit?
- No shit.

47:40.988 --> 47:42.649
You always look at the guy
who found the bomb,

47:42.723 --> 47:44.658
just like you always look at the guy
who found the body.

47:44.725 --> 47:47.524
But this guy, he's got a bad past.

47:48.429 --> 47:52.366
Fits the profile of
the hero-bomber to a T.

47:52.433 --> 47:56.131
That fat fuck who lives with his mother.
Of course.

47:56.604 --> 47:59.903
How did I miss that?
I mean, that is amazing.

48:00.775 --> 48:01.742
Ooh.

48:01.809 --> 48:03.174
You are good.

48:03.344 --> 48:04.743
You're very good.

48:04.912 --> 48:06.175
Yeah.

48:06.347 --> 48:08.247
This kind of puts a clock
on things, though.

48:08.316 --> 48:10.147
You wanna get a room
or just go to my car?

48:13.788 --> 48:14.812
This is happening.

48:14.989 --> 48:16.115
This is happening.

48:17.858 --> 48:18.917
Let's get the fuck outta here.

48:18.993 --> 48:19.983
- Okay.
- Yeah.

48:27.602 --> 48:30.435
Sugar, I need you to do
one of those better word things you do.

48:30.938 --> 48:32.304
You mean rewrite you?

48:32.940 --> 48:36.171
Yeah, you know I write like a brick,
and this one is kind of special.

48:36.777 --> 48:38.143
What is it?

48:39.880 --> 48:42.941
Oh, nothing. It's just that the, uh,

48:43.517 --> 48:48.148
the FBI is looking at
Richard Jewell as the bomber.

48:51.692 --> 48:52.921
Do you have time for me now?

48:52.994 --> 48:54.985
- I got all the time you need.
- All right, let's work.

48:55.062 --> 48:56.155
Tell me everything.

48:57.131 --> 48:58.189
Where you going?

48:58.299 --> 48:59.494
To get my notes.

49:02.737 --> 49:05.228
"The security guard who
first alerted police to the pipe bomb

49:05.306 --> 49:07.604
that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park

49:07.675 --> 49:10.576
is the target of the federal
investigation into the incident

49:10.645 --> 49:14.081
that resulted in two deaths
and injured more than 100.

49:14.248 --> 49:16.979
Richard Jewell, 33,
a former law enforcement officer

49:17.051 --> 49:19.213
fits the profile of the lone bomber.

49:19.286 --> 49:22.051
This profile generally includes
a frustrated white man

49:22.123 --> 49:25.058
who is a former police officer,
member of the military,

49:25.159 --> 49:29.528
or police wannabe
who seeks to become a hero.

49:29.630 --> 49:32.031
Jewell has become a celebrity
in the wake of the bombing,

49:32.099 --> 49:33.829
making appearances on The Today Show,"

49:33.901 --> 49:35.392
FBI knows you have this?

49:35.903 --> 49:37.735
Oh, yeah,
My guy says everybody's got it.

49:38.005 --> 49:39.371
Networks have it.

49:39.674 --> 49:40.868
CNN has it.

49:41.042 --> 49:44.409
Got a guy at GBI says the same thing.
Bureau's looking at Jewell.

49:45.012 --> 49:47.037
Then why isn't anyone reporting it?

49:48.249 --> 49:49.910
Anybody feel like
we're getting worked here?

49:51.519 --> 49:55.148
God damn, John, these are our Olympics.

49:55.256 --> 49:58.749
If we don't lead on this story,
what the fuck are we doing here?

50:02.263 --> 50:03.856
Okay.

50:04.031 --> 50:06.022
Tear up the afternoon edition,
and replate the front page.

50:06.100 --> 50:07.124
We're running it

50:07.401 --> 50:08.630
Thank you.

50:10.371 --> 50:13.466
This is CNN Breaking News,

50:13.607 --> 50:17.408
We've been asked to relay the story
to you verbatim, which we'll do.

50:17.478 --> 50:20.345
"The security guard," and this
is a quote from The Atlanta Journal,

50:20.448 --> 50:22.541
"who first alerted police
to the pipe bomb

50:22.616 --> 50:25.085
that exploded in Centennial Olympic Park

50:25.152 --> 50:27.781
is the focus
of the federal investigation..."

50:28.322 --> 50:31.155
Now, to recap quickly,
we are just getting details

50:31.225 --> 50:33.819
on what appears to be
a major development,.

50:54.415 --> 50:55.541
Congratulations.

51:03.924 --> 51:06.917
Whoo!

51:11.198 --> 51:14.395
Yeah!

51:14.969 --> 51:18.428
Who the fuck leaked this investigation
to the AJC? Huh?

51:18.506 --> 51:19.564
Shaw!

51:19.640 --> 51:21.301
- Sir?
- Get Jewell in here.

51:21.375 --> 51:23.469
Nonconfrontational interview,
today!

51:40.461 --> 51:42.122
- Hello?
- Richard Jewell?

51:43.464 --> 51:45.227
Yeah. I'm... I'm Richard.

51:45.766 --> 51:49.293
Special Agents Dan Bennet,
Tom Shaw, FBI. You got a minute?

51:49.370 --> 51:52.362
Yeah, I've got...
Yeah, I've got a minute. Come on in.

51:52.673 --> 51:53.640
Thank you.

51:55.476 --> 51:56.466
Ma'am.

51:57.111 --> 51:57.941
Um...

51:59.547 --> 52:04.678
Um, Mama, this is Agent Bennet and Shaw.

52:04.852 --> 52:06.820
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my mother, Bobi.

52:06.987 --> 52:08.182
- How do you do?
- Pleasure, ma'am.

52:10.357 --> 52:11.586
What can I do for y'all?

52:11.859 --> 52:14.419
Well, the Bureau's actually
putting together a training video

52:14.662 --> 52:18.223
on how to deal with suspicious packages,
and we'd love you to be a part of it.

52:18.399 --> 52:19.832
How's that sound to you?

52:20.901 --> 52:24.269
I would love to help out with that,
yeah, absolutely.

52:24.438 --> 52:27.305
You did it, Richard. You showed them
what kind of cop you can be.

52:27.474 --> 52:28.305
Look at this.

52:28.375 --> 52:30.071
See, the only thing is
that we're shooting it today.

52:30.211 --> 52:33.578
So, we'd need you to follow us
to the field office right now.

52:33.681 --> 52:35.706
Because time's a little bit tight.
Is that okay?

52:35.883 --> 52:38.750
You know what? I would love to,
but I still got to work today.

52:38.953 --> 52:40.045
I got my shift

52:40.187 --> 52:41.780
Uh, this won't take long, Richard.

52:43.924 --> 52:47.759
Yeah, you know what?
I bet we can make that work.

52:47.828 --> 52:50.798
I can call in and tell them
I'm gonna be a little bit late.

52:50.865 --> 52:54.164
I mean, I want to help you all,
and I'm law enforcement, too.

52:54.235 --> 52:55.668
- We know that Yes, indeed.
- We know that.

52:55.736 --> 52:56.726
Yeah.

52:56.804 --> 52:58.533
- All right
- So, you're all set to go, then, huh?

52:58.806 --> 53:00.535
- Yep. Yeah.
- Great.

53:00.608 --> 53:01.632
- Let's do it
- Lovely to meet you, ma'am.

53:01.709 --> 53:02.676
- Thank you very much.
- Nice to meet you.

53:02.743 --> 53:04.211
- Nice to meet you.
- Lovely home.

53:05.479 --> 53:07.038
I don't know what's going on.

53:07.114 --> 53:09.412
I'm so proud of you.

53:09.583 --> 53:11.313
Oh, goodness.

53:17.892 --> 53:19.450
- Mr. Jewell...
- Why are the FBI here?

53:19.627 --> 53:21.618
Mr. Jewell,
what have they told you?

53:22.563 --> 53:24.087
Are they letting you go back to work?

53:24.164 --> 53:25.097
Uh, yeah.

53:25.165 --> 53:26.997
They're letting you go to work?
You're good to go?

53:27.067 --> 53:27.932
Yeah.

53:28.102 --> 53:30.002
Are the FBI investigating you?

53:31.505 --> 53:35.738
I imagine they'll investigate anyone
who was at the park that night.

53:35.809 --> 53:37.539
That includes all of you, too.

53:37.978 --> 53:40.242
Have they told you yet
you can't leave town?

53:40.648 --> 53:41.615
No.

53:41.682 --> 53:42.911
Mr. Jewell,
are you under arrest?

53:42.983 --> 53:44.246
You're free to go
wherever you like?

53:44.318 --> 53:45.808
You're free to go
wherever you'd like, Richard?

53:45.953 --> 53:47.079
- Who are you working with?
- What happened out there?

53:47.154 --> 53:48.883
What do you think of
the appearance that

53:48.989 --> 53:50.958
people are saying that
you are now the prime suspect?

53:51.125 --> 53:52.524
What's going on, Richard?

53:52.693 --> 53:53.524
I'm not a suspect.

53:53.594 --> 53:55.084
Why are you
talking to the FBI?

53:55.262 --> 53:57.663
Mr. Jewell, what does
the FBI want with you?

53:58.198 --> 54:00.133
Can you give us any more information?

54:39.273 --> 54:42.242
Sorry, I think I got some
media following me.

54:42.309 --> 54:45.302
No. Those are our guys, bud.
Those are our guys.

54:55.089 --> 54:58.957
"Richard Jewell, 33,
a former law enforcement officer,"

54:59.126 --> 55:03.120
the story goes on to say,
"fits the profile of the lone bomber.

55:03.197 --> 55:06.690
This profile generally includes
a frustrated white man

55:06.767 --> 55:09.600
who is a former police officer,
member of the military,

55:09.770 --> 55:12.569
or police wannabe
who seeks to become a hero.

55:12.639 --> 55:15.632
The security guard who first alerted
police to the pipe bomb

55:15.709 --> 55:18.645
that exploded in
Centennial Olympic Park,"

55:19.713 --> 55:22.808
So, up until
it obviously went sideways,

55:22.883 --> 55:25.784
everything pretty normal
about that evening, right?

55:26.120 --> 55:29.055
No, it was a regular night
from what I could tell.

55:29.123 --> 55:30.750
Everyone was having a great time.

55:30.824 --> 55:33.384
It was like a celebration.

55:33.460 --> 55:34.723
Yeah. No air of...

55:34.828 --> 55:36.660
Yeah, you were having fun.

55:36.730 --> 55:38.289
I was having fun. It was a good time.

55:38.399 --> 55:41.197
But there was some guys

55:41.402 --> 55:42.699
with beer cans or something like that?

55:42.770 --> 55:44.101
Guys behind the tower.

55:44.171 --> 55:45.935
What were they doing there?
They were throwing...

55:46.040 --> 55:47.632
- Beer bottles.
- Beer bottles. Yeah.

55:47.708 --> 55:50.507
They were horsing around, fooling.

55:50.577 --> 55:54.878
I broke it up and I gave them
atalking-to, and they left Yep.

55:54.948 --> 55:56.541
And that was behind the tower?

55:56.784 --> 55:57.944
- Yes, sir.
- Right

55:58.018 --> 55:59.782
then you came back around the tower

55:59.853 --> 56:02.379
and that's where you saw
the package unattended?

56:02.689 --> 56:04.180
- Yes, sir.
- Right

56:04.258 --> 56:07.660
And did you see anyone
walking away from the bench?

56:08.262 --> 56:10.822
No, sir. I would've
tailed them if I did.

56:10.931 --> 56:12.160
Yeah.

56:13.133 --> 56:15.500
So, you have no idea
who might have put that package there?

56:15.736 --> 56:16.896
No, sir.

56:16.970 --> 56:20.600
But whoever did,
I think they ought to fry.

56:21.575 --> 56:23.168
Yeah. We think so, too, Richard.

56:23.243 --> 56:24.540
Absolutely.

56:26.046 --> 56:28.037
So, here's what we're gonna do.

56:28.682 --> 56:30.275
We're trying to be
as authentic as possible

56:30.350 --> 56:33.445
and part of that has to do
with how you treat a suspect.

56:33.520 --> 56:34.419
Mmm-hmm.

56:34.521 --> 56:36.615
All right? So, what we're gonna
is we're gonna pretend

56:36.690 --> 56:39.125
that we actually brought you in,
in that regard.

56:39.193 --> 56:40.126
- Right?
- That...

56:40.194 --> 56:42.754
And we read you your Miranda rights
and you've agreed to waive them.

56:42.830 --> 56:45.299
- In fact, we have a form you can si
- Yeah. Why don't you..

56:45.365 --> 56:46.526
This'll be good.

56:46.900 --> 56:47.958
Just so it looks real.

56:48.035 --> 56:50.299
Yeah. So, you just sign
on the bottom there

56:50.370 --> 56:52.498
and we'll get that on tape

56:52.573 --> 56:55.599
and then we'll continue on
with the interview.

56:57.911 --> 56:59.174
Okay.

56:59.813 --> 57:01.076
Yeah.

57:06.453 --> 57:07.750
I'm sorry, Richard,
maybe I wasn't clear.

57:07.888 --> 57:10.550
You actually have to
physically sign the paper.

57:12.960 --> 57:15.554
This is a real document.

57:15.662 --> 57:17.597
Well, of course.

57:17.664 --> 57:20.190
We're going for
authenticity here, Richard.

57:20.367 --> 57:23.064
It has to be real for the video.

57:25.305 --> 57:26.773
sorry, sir.

57:27.875 --> 57:32.210
I don't think I would feel comfortable
signing something like this.

57:32.679 --> 57:34.147
Richard, we just want...

57:34.214 --> 57:36.478
You know what? Why don't we...
Why don't we take a quick break?

57:36.550 --> 57:39.178
- Go ahead and stop the camera.
- Okay.

57:39.253 --> 57:40.083
Um...

57:40.888 --> 57:42.981
- Yeah. Okay.
- We'll just talk for a second.

57:43.056 --> 57:45.048
- We'll be right back.
- Right back.

57:52.766 --> 57:54.757
I was a sheriff deputy.

57:55.536 --> 57:56.730
Habersham County.

58:00.073 --> 58:01.541
All right, Richard.

58:01.708 --> 58:03.335
We're gonna pretend like
none of that ever happened.

58:03.410 --> 58:05.743
Let's get a new tape going. Okay?

58:06.213 --> 58:07.237
Um...

58:07.314 --> 58:09.305
What we're gonna do now...

58:10.117 --> 58:11.482
There you go. I got it

58:11.552 --> 58:12.985
Get her out there
and we'll throw it away.

58:13.053 --> 58:15.215
What we're gonna do now is

58:15.289 --> 58:17.280
Agent Bennet's gonna
come back in the room,

58:17.457 --> 58:19.221
he's gonna reintroduce himself,
show you his credentials,

58:19.293 --> 58:21.090
just like a professional interview.

58:21.228 --> 58:23.458
And then we're gonna
actually read you your Miranda rights.

58:23.530 --> 58:24.827
Why would he do that?

58:24.898 --> 58:26.423
To make it more authentic, Richard.

58:26.500 --> 58:28.434
We want this to look
as authentic as possible.

58:28.869 --> 58:30.860
Come on in, Agent Bennet.

58:32.406 --> 58:34.101
Mr. Jewell...

58:34.608 --> 58:36.872
Special Agent Dan Bennet, FBI.

58:36.944 --> 58:39.037
- I'm sorry. I think... I'm sorry.
- You have the right to...

58:39.112 --> 58:41.945
I think maybe I should
contact my attorney.

58:44.551 --> 58:45.951
Now, why would you
wanna do that, Richard?

58:46.086 --> 58:47.281
I mean...

58:47.754 --> 58:49.086
You're the hero, right?

58:49.323 --> 58:50.790
Unless there's something
you wanna tell us.

58:50.924 --> 58:52.915
No. But I just

58:55.963 --> 58:57.931
think I better call him.

58:59.566 --> 59:01.057
Okay.

59:06.139 --> 59:07.402
Here you go.

59:08.475 --> 59:09.738
Press nine.

59:17.818 --> 59:21.914
Yes, hello, I'm calling Information
to get ahold...

59:22.055 --> 59:25.423
The name is Watson Bryant
He's a lawyer.

59:27.094 --> 59:29.324
Thank you. Yeah, connect me.

59:34.301 --> 59:36.201
I'm getting his message machine.

59:36.270 --> 59:37.532
So, I'm gonna leave a message for him.

59:37.604 --> 59:39.902
Go ahead.
Leave a message and that'll be...

59:41.908 --> 59:42.967
This...

59:43.043 --> 59:44.374
This is Watson.

59:45.145 --> 59:46.704
Watson Bryant, this is Richard Jewell

59:47.547 --> 59:50.278
calling in regards to, urn,

59:50.984 --> 59:54.079
something somewhat serious,
I would like you to call me back.

59:54.154 --> 59:56.748
I'm at the FBI office in Atlanta,

59:57.691 --> 01:00:00.126
If you could call me back
at your earliest convenience.

01:00:00.193 --> 01:00:02.185
Thank you. Bye,

01:00:10.103 --> 01:00:12.800
You can't leave your phone off.
I have to be able to reach you.

01:00:12.873 --> 01:00:13.863
What's wrong?

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.340
You need more toner?

01:00:16.877 --> 01:00:18.674
- He called three times.
- Who? Who called?

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:19.712
Who? Richard.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.941
Three times from
the FBI interrogation room.

01:00:22.015 --> 01:00:24.109
All right, all right,
all right, slow down. Slow down.

01:00:25.385 --> 01:00:26.819
Jesus Christ.

01:00:29.423 --> 01:00:31.823
Am I the only lawyer this guy knows?

01:00:31.892 --> 01:00:32.984
Yes.

01:00:35.762 --> 01:00:36.752
The paper says...

01:00:38.098 --> 01:00:40.624
Paper says the Bureau has him
dead to rights.

01:00:41.301 --> 01:00:43.895
Where I come from, when
the government says someone's guilty...

01:00:43.970 --> 01:00:45.461
...it's how you know they're innocent.

01:00:46.373 --> 01:00:47.806
It's different here?

01:00:48.675 --> 01:00:50.370
I don't know. Looks pretty bad.

01:00:51.812 --> 01:00:53.439
I don't care.

01:00:54.348 --> 01:00:58.444
We'll get three or four cases
as juicy as this tomorrow

01:00:58.618 --> 01:00:59.950
and you have so much else to do.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.647
All right, all right. Connect me with
the field office, would you, Nadya?

01:01:04.958 --> 01:01:06.085
Right away.

01:01:06.660 --> 01:01:07.650
Thank you.

01:01:07.828 --> 01:01:09.625
Unless you're too busy.

01:01:11.131 --> 01:01:14.123
- Don't you have any work to do?
- I have nothing else to do, no.

01:01:14.434 --> 01:01:16.801
Yes, this is Watson Bryant,
attorney for Richard Jewell.

01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:19.032
I'd like to speak to my client, please.

01:01:19.106 --> 01:01:21.472
I'm sorry, sir,
we have no one here by that name.

01:01:22.676 --> 01:01:25.111
Yeah, you do, actually.

01:01:25.278 --> 01:01:27.110
Put me on the phone with my client now.

01:01:28.181 --> 01:01:31.151
Please call back later, sir.
Maybe we'll have more information.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.151
Dial that number again, would you?

01:01:50.303 --> 01:01:52.772
Yeah, this is Watson Bryant again,
attorney for Richard Jewell.

01:01:52.839 --> 01:01:55.468
My next call is gonna be to
Mike Wallace of 60 Minutes

01:01:55.542 --> 01:01:58.239
to ask him why the FBI
would deny a citizen

01:01:58.311 --> 01:02:00.280
his constitutional right
to legal counsel.

01:02:00.347 --> 01:02:02.645
Can I have the spelling
of your name, please?

01:02:04.384 --> 01:02:05.681
Got a call for you.

01:02:09.923 --> 01:02:10.913
Hello?

01:02:11.091 --> 01:02:13.583
Richard, it's Watson.
What are you doing in there?

01:02:14.094 --> 01:02:16.688
They said they needed me
for a training film.

01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:18.020
No, they don't need you for...

01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:20.225
You're a suspect
Have you read the newspapers?

01:02:21.201 --> 01:02:24.171
Have you signed anything?
Have you confessed to anything?

01:02:24.438 --> 01:02:26.929
No, of course not. I didn't do this.

01:02:27.941 --> 01:02:30.842
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me real carefully.

01:02:30.911 --> 01:02:34.779
Just don't say anything to anyone.
You understand me?

01:02:35.949 --> 01:02:37.178
Get your ass out of there.

01:02:37.350 --> 01:02:39.342
Let me talk to the agent in charge.

01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.086
He wants to talk to you.

01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:44.113
This is Agent Shaw,

01:02:44.191 --> 01:02:46.716
This interrogation's over.
Not another word, you hear me?

01:02:47.928 --> 01:02:49.225
He's been cooperating fully.

01:02:49.396 --> 01:02:50.693
Hey, did I stutter?

01:02:50.864 --> 01:02:52.263
No more questions!

01:02:52.566 --> 01:02:56.195
- Get his ass out of there, you hear me?
- Okay, Well,

01:02:56.970 --> 01:02:58.563
have a nice...

01:02:59.606 --> 01:03:01.335
He hung up on me.

01:03:01.741 --> 01:03:03.903
You have a very loud lawyer.
Congratulations.

01:03:17.123 --> 01:03:18.216
Were you charged?

01:03:22.662 --> 01:03:24.995
Did you do it? Did you set that bomb?

01:03:25.165 --> 01:03:27.657
Richard,
what has the FBI said to

01:03:28.335 --> 01:03:29.495
Richard, what did they say to you today?

01:03:30.637 --> 01:03:32.230
What did the FBI
say to you, Richard?

01:03:34.774 --> 01:03:35.798
Did the FBI charge you?

01:03:35.976 --> 01:03:37.307
Did you
set that bomb, Richard?

01:03:47.287 --> 01:03:49.312
What can you tell us
about the FBI interview?

01:03:52.459 --> 01:03:54.985
Richard, what did the FBI
say to you? Just tell us.

01:03:57.464 --> 01:03:59.591
We are having some trouble
connecting to Wayne Scott

01:03:59.666 --> 01:04:01.031
We hope to have more from him later.

01:04:01.201 --> 01:04:03.567
He can update us
about the traffic situation,

01:04:03.637 --> 01:04:05.195
also since Centennial Park is...

01:04:05.272 --> 01:04:06.398
They're all after me now.

01:04:06.473 --> 01:04:07.963
...he may be our only view of the park
for a while.

01:04:08.141 --> 01:04:10.633
So we will checking back.
Right now we're gonna throw it back to

01:04:10.810 --> 01:04:13.302
NBC News and Tom Brokaw.

01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:15.776
The speculation is that the FBI

01:04:15.849 --> 01:04:17.976
is close to "making the case,"
in their language.

01:04:18.151 --> 01:04:20.313
They probably have enough
to arrest him right now,

01:04:20.487 --> 01:04:22.046
probably enough to prosecute him,

01:04:22.222 --> 01:04:24.213
but you always wanna have enough
to convict him as well.

01:04:24.291 --> 01:04:25.690
There are still some holes in this case.

01:04:25.759 --> 01:04:27.386
Why did Tom Brokaw say that about you?

01:04:27.494 --> 01:04:28.358
That was Tom Brokaw

01:04:28.428 --> 01:04:31.329
with the latest update on
the Centennial Park bombing.

01:04:31.398 --> 01:04:33.491
When we come back...

01:04:33.667 --> 01:04:35.066
I don't know.

01:04:50.717 --> 01:04:52.151
- Hey, who's this?
- I don't know.

01:04:52.419 --> 01:04:55.411
I don't know who this guy is.
Come with me. Let's get him.

01:04:55.488 --> 01:04:59.050
Sir? Sir? Sir? Sir? Who are you, sir?
Are you Richard's friend?

01:04:59.125 --> 01:05:01.287
Who are you here to see?
Who are you here to see?

01:05:01.361 --> 01:05:02.385
Are you a friend of Richard's?

01:05:02.562 --> 01:05:03.586
- Why are you here?
- Who are you?

01:05:03.763 --> 01:05:05.993
I'm a friend of Richard's.

01:05:08.168 --> 01:05:10.364
Can you give us some insight?
Did you help him set that bomb?

01:05:10.537 --> 01:05:12.369
What's your name?
Tell us anything at all.

01:05:12.439 --> 01:05:13.406
Are you a family member?

01:05:13.673 --> 01:05:15.198
I'm a friend of Richard's.

01:05:25.452 --> 01:05:26.385
Hey.

01:05:26.686 --> 01:05:28.848
- Hey.
- Shit show out there.

01:05:30.423 --> 01:05:32.414
You got that $100 you owe me?

01:05:34.561 --> 01:05:35.755
Oh! You must be Mom.

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:37.260
How are you? I'm Watson.

01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:40.459
I'm so sorry the world has gone insane.

01:05:40.533 --> 01:05:42.798
Oh, that's annoying.

01:05:42.869 --> 01:05:44.428
Let's get rid of that, shall we?

01:05:44.504 --> 01:05:46.029
Uh...

01:05:46.139 --> 01:05:47.903
It's kind of like a drill in your ear.

01:05:48.375 --> 01:05:51.708
For the next little while, the only
person you need to talk to is me.

01:05:52.312 --> 01:05:54.212
He does not open his mouth again

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.476
if there's a cop present,
or an FBI agent

01:05:56.583 --> 01:05:58.745
or someone from GBI,
or a crossing guard.

01:05:58.818 --> 01:05:59.717
Is that clear?

01:05:59.819 --> 01:06:02.721
I was raised to respect authority, sir.

01:06:03.056 --> 01:06:07.323
Son, authority's what's outside that
window looking to eat you alive.

01:06:08.495 --> 01:06:09.655
How about a beer?

01:06:11.731 --> 01:06:15.668
- Yeah, sorry. Let me grab you something.
- No, no. Thanks, Radar.

01:06:15.735 --> 01:06:16.702
Yeah.

01:06:16.770 --> 01:06:18.362
I'm gonna need to be
alone with your son.

01:06:18.438 --> 01:06:21.965
I hate to be rude, but if there's
a third party, there's no privilege.

01:06:22.042 --> 01:06:22.940
Oh.

01:06:23.009 --> 01:06:25.740
Yeah, third party,
then they can

01:06:25.912 --> 01:06:28.176
- compel anything we say.
- No.

01:06:28.314 --> 01:06:31.182
Very nice to meet you.
Sorry to be rude, Bobi. Thanks.

01:06:35.288 --> 01:06:37.951
You belong to any
extremist groups, Richard?

01:06:38.124 --> 01:06:39.683
No, I hate all that stuff.

01:06:39.859 --> 01:06:41.589
Any anti-government affiliations or...

01:06:42.962 --> 01:06:43.930
No.

01:06:44.464 --> 01:06:47.763
Any of your friends affiliated
with any fringe organizations?

01:06:52.305 --> 01:06:55.741
Not unless being a Baptist
is a religious cult.

01:06:56.009 --> 01:06:56.999
NRA?

01:06:57.444 --> 01:06:59.537
N... Is the NRA a fringe group?

01:07:00.046 --> 01:07:02.948
You ever hung out with any
Ku Klux Klan members?

01:07:03.183 --> 01:07:05.617
If I did, it wouldn't have
been on purpose.

01:07:05.785 --> 01:07:09.187
You contacted any other lawyers
about this book deal?

01:07:09.489 --> 01:07:11.355
No. You're the only one.

01:07:12.125 --> 01:07:14.287
Richard, this is capital crime here.

01:07:15.361 --> 01:07:17.353
This is death penalty.

01:07:18.798 --> 01:07:20.994
I can help you,
but only if I know the truth.

01:07:21.067 --> 01:07:22.364
Did you do this?

01:07:24.471 --> 01:07:25.460
No.

01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:28.367
Are you asking if I did it?

01:07:28.441 --> 01:07:32.344
I'm asking you if you had any part
of the Centennial bombing, yes.

01:07:32.512 --> 01:07:36.540
So, if you had anything to do with this,

01:07:36.983 --> 01:07:38.075
had any part in this...

01:07:38.284 --> 01:07:40.344
I did...

01:07:40.854 --> 01:07:43.721
I did not plant that bomb
in Centennial Park

01:07:43.890 --> 01:07:47.884
and I made the mistake
of assuming you knew that.

01:07:51.164 --> 01:07:54.099
All right, well, let's beat
the hell out of these bastards.

01:07:55.201 --> 01:07:56.191
Okay?

01:08:02.709 --> 01:08:04.336
Are you his attorney?

01:08:13.253 --> 01:08:16.245
What is your relationship
with Richard Jewell?

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:19.149
I think the FBI
would be derelict

01:08:19.225 --> 01:08:21.386
not to investigate Richard Jewell.

01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:22.790
They're just doing their jobs.

01:08:22.962 --> 01:08:24.225
When are you meeting
with him again?

01:08:24.397 --> 01:08:25.761
No,
they're just doing their job.

01:08:25.932 --> 01:08:28.799
They're just making sure
no rock is unturned.

01:08:28.968 --> 01:08:30.402
Are you gonna meet
with him again soon?

01:08:30.470 --> 01:08:31.437
Excuse me.

01:08:31.504 --> 01:08:34.667
Yes. I've been friends
with Richard for ten years.

01:08:34.808 --> 01:08:36.537
- Are you his lawyer?
- I am.

01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:37.975
- Did he set that bomb?
- You are his lawyer?

01:08:38.243 --> 01:08:39.268
- Yeah.
- What is your name?

01:08:39.444 --> 01:08:41.243
You'll be defending him?

01:08:41.314 --> 01:08:42.247
Possibly.

01:08:51.591 --> 01:08:53.457
Not quite real estate law,
is it, Mr. Bryant?

01:08:53.626 --> 01:08:56.220
Whoa! Jesus Christ!

01:08:56.462 --> 01:08:57.430
Who the hell are you?

01:08:57.596 --> 01:08:59.326
I could be the best friend
you'll ever have.

01:08:59.499 --> 01:09:01.091
Kathy Scruggs. AJC.

01:09:02.068 --> 01:09:04.366
Of course you are.

01:09:04.437 --> 01:09:05.268
Get out.

01:09:05.337 --> 01:09:08.103
Have you secured an actual
defense attorney for Richard yet?

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:09.765
No comment

01:09:09.943 --> 01:09:12.104
- Get out of the car.
- See, "no comment" doesn't help me,

01:09:12.178 --> 01:09:13.645
which means I can't help you.

01:09:15.481 --> 01:09:18.781
Is that what you wanna do?
You want to help me?

01:09:18.952 --> 01:09:21.944
Watson, I don't get the sense you grasp
the tank that's about to roll over you.

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:23.648
We're talking about
the US government here

01:09:23.723 --> 01:09:25.247
investigating a terrorism suspect.

01:09:25.325 --> 01:09:27.225
- You need me.
- Okay. Listen, crazy lady,

01:09:27.292 --> 01:09:29.193
you want me to call the cops?

01:09:29.595 --> 01:09:30.756
Oh, please do.

01:09:30.830 --> 01:09:32.854
The cops love me.
I tell their stories all day.

01:09:32.932 --> 01:09:33.956
Let me tell yours.

01:09:35.501 --> 01:09:37.332
I'm just gonna ask a couple questions
that'll help you tell your story.

01:09:37.403 --> 01:09:38.700
- And you need me to help...
- Get out. Get out of my...

01:09:38.770 --> 01:09:40.535
- You got some balls, man.
- Yes, I do.

01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:41.630
- Get out.
- Come on.

01:09:41.707 --> 01:09:43.175
I'll just ask you a few questions.

01:09:43.343 --> 01:09:44.810
- Get out.
- We can go together.

01:09:44.877 --> 01:09:47.506
- Come on. Til get my notepad.
- Get the fuck out of my car now!

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:49.372
Get out of my car!

01:09:49.549 --> 01:09:50.982
I'm sick of this shit.

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:52.777
You know where to find me.

01:10:04.631 --> 01:10:06.895
- Yeah. Don't worry.
- Never been on TV before.

01:10:06.966 --> 01:10:08.229
You'll be fine.

01:10:08.635 --> 01:10:10.159
Mr. Jewell's attorney, Mr. Bryant.

01:10:10.236 --> 01:10:11.328
- Thanks for coming in.
- You're welcome.

01:10:11.404 --> 01:10:12.599
What are the authorities
telling you about

01:10:12.672 --> 01:10:15.198
- their suspicions about your client?
- Uh, nothing.

01:10:15.308 --> 01:10:16.798
No communication whatsoever?

01:10:17.944 --> 01:10:20.606
All they've said to me is that
they're not going to arrest him.

01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.079
That's what they told me yesterday.

01:10:22.148 --> 01:10:23.343
You believe that?

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:24.406
No.

01:10:24.484 --> 01:10:26.077
You think they are going to arrest him?

01:10:26.152 --> 01:10:29.144
I don't think they'd tell me whether
they were or they weren't That's all.

01:10:29.222 --> 01:10:32.453
What do you think of the manner in
which the FBI has treated your client

01:10:32.592 --> 01:10:34.822
- pursuing this investigation?
- I think whoever the bum was

01:10:34.894 --> 01:10:37.955
that leaked that Richard Jewell
was the focus of this investigation,

01:10:38.031 --> 01:10:41.262
he deserves to be prosecuted
or dealt with in some serious way.

01:10:41.334 --> 01:10:43.894
I don't think that this investigation

01:10:44.003 --> 01:10:48.805
should be conducted under
world spotlight, if you will, like this.

01:10:48.875 --> 01:10:52.140
What's your client told you about this
cabin that's being searched today?

01:10:52.211 --> 01:10:53.804
It's his former residence,
as I understand it.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.177
You need to understand somethi

01:10:55.248 --> 01:10:59.480
I have barely had the time
to take a breath in this case

01:10:59.552 --> 01:11:01.384
since it started the other night.

01:11:01.454 --> 01:11:06.415
We have been reacting
to the media, to the FBI,

01:11:06.592 --> 01:11:08.288
and I have not sat down

01:11:08.361 --> 01:11:11.592
and conducted an in-depth interview
about all these things

01:11:11.664 --> 01:11:13.030
that y'all are asking me about.

01:11:13.099 --> 01:11:14.658
Then why are you so convinced
of his innocence?

01:11:14.734 --> 01:11:16.133
Because I've known Richard for a while.

01:11:16.202 --> 01:11:18.193
I've looked him in the eye
and I've asked him the question.

01:11:18.271 --> 01:11:20.103
But you've admitted to me
you didn't even know he had a cabin.

01:11:20.173 --> 01:11:22.505
You didn't know about this...
this prior arrest.

01:11:22.575 --> 01:11:24.305
You didn't know about
the prior misdemeanors.

01:11:24.377 --> 01:11:26.345
There's a whole lot of priors
you didn't know about.

01:11:26.446 --> 01:11:29.882
I have not conducted a thorough
investigation into Richard's history.

01:11:30.049 --> 01:11:30.982
No, I understand all that.

01:11:31.150 --> 01:11:33.449
I guess what I'm asking you is
considering that you haven't done that

01:11:33.619 --> 01:11:35.485
and considering there are things
that you didn't know,

01:11:35.555 --> 01:11:36.886
why are you so convinced
of his innocence?

01:11:36.956 --> 01:11:37.980
Because I believe him.

01:11:38.057 --> 01:11:39.047
Plain and simple?

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.593
Yeah. That's right

01:11:41.227 --> 01:11:44.094
I don't know a whole lot of things
about a whole lot of people that I know.

01:11:44.263 --> 01:11:47.995
I don't have Richard's police records.
You may. I don't...

01:11:48.067 --> 01:11:52.163
I have not gotten up to speed
on some things. That's all.

01:11:52.338 --> 01:11:54.363
But just because
I don't know these things

01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:56.602
doesn't mean that I don't have a feel

01:11:56.776 --> 01:11:59.837
for where I think
Richard is in this case.

01:12:00.013 --> 01:12:01.981
Were you aware that
the Habersham Sheriffs Department

01:12:02.048 --> 01:12:04.483
had asked him to seek
psychological counseling?

01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:06.041
I don't know that either.

01:12:06.319 --> 01:12:09.345
But I know a lot of people who ought to
have psychological counseling.

01:12:09.422 --> 01:12:11.550
Watson Bryant, thank you very much.

01:12:11.791 --> 01:12:13.088
See ya Thank you.

01:12:13.259 --> 01:12:16.160
Twenty-two past the hour.
We'll be right back.

01:12:16.863 --> 01:12:19.161
First of all, we wanna
reassure the public that

01:12:19.332 --> 01:12:23.200
Atlanta is a safe place
in spite of the tragedy of last evening.

01:12:23.369 --> 01:12:24.632
Hello?

01:12:24.804 --> 01:12:27.796
Were you arrested
for impersonating an officer?

01:12:29.008 --> 01:12:30.271
Yeah, once.

01:12:30.343 --> 01:12:32.937
- It was complicated.
- It was...

01:12:33.212 --> 01:12:34.839
Were you planning on telling me?

01:12:35.181 --> 01:12:37.172
Yeah, of course. I just...

01:12:37.483 --> 01:12:40.282
In all the hoopla yesterday,
I guess I just forgot.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.613
Jesus Christ! What the...

01:12:42.789 --> 01:12:44.689
Was there anything else that you forgot?

01:12:44.857 --> 01:12:48.794
'Cause I just had my ass handed to me
on the fucking Today Show!

01:12:48.861 --> 01:12:50.261
Thanks a lot

01:12:55.334 --> 01:12:57.064
More great news.

01:13:01.107 --> 01:13:04.975
The man who would be king,
Michael Johnson, Waco, Texas

01:13:05.044 --> 01:13:07.945
attempting to do what no man
has ever done in Olympic competition,

01:13:08.047 --> 01:13:10.573
win both the 400 and 200 meters.

01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:11.774
Go.

01:13:13.119 --> 01:13:15.645
Flashbulbs flashing,
Ato Boldon away last

01:13:17.957 --> 01:13:20.654
Here's Frank Fredericks,
And here comes Michael Johnson,

01:13:20.993 --> 01:13:22.620
About the right speed, I guess.

01:13:22.862 --> 01:13:23.988
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:13:24.097 --> 01:13:26.031
They're approaching
the top of the straightaway.

01:13:26.099 --> 01:13:27.657
Michael Johnson reaching deep.

01:13:28.968 --> 01:13:30.368
What are we clocking?

01:13:30.970 --> 01:13:34.429
He has the lead, Michael Johnson
is closing on the finish!

01:13:36.843 --> 01:13:40.472
Michael Johnson running for gold!
And it's Olympic history!

01:13:40.546 --> 01:13:42.640
He destroys his own record!

01:13:42.815 --> 01:13:44.613
- Time.
- Six minutes.

01:13:45.351 --> 01:13:48.753
Okay, we know the second 911 call
was placed at 12...

01:13:48.821 --> 01:13:49.788
58.

01:13:49.856 --> 01:13:51.016
From the pay phone that was right here.

01:13:51.124 --> 01:13:53.319
We also know that
Richard was inside the park

01:13:53.392 --> 01:13:55.861
near the sound and light tower at 12...

01:13:55.928 --> 01:13:56.827
57.

01:13:56.896 --> 01:13:58.557
When Bill Miller called the backpack in.

01:13:58.631 --> 01:14:00.793
He would've had to
cover the distance in...

01:14:00.867 --> 01:14:03.495
One minute. So he couldn't have done it.

01:14:04.403 --> 01:14:06.167
Could've ridden a bike, I guess.

01:14:06.639 --> 01:14:08.073
There and back? No.

01:14:10.276 --> 01:14:11.937
He really didn't do this.

01:14:14.847 --> 01:14:15.939
No.

01:14:18.985 --> 01:14:20.976
This kid's getting railroaded.

01:14:24.657 --> 01:14:26.386
We're gonna help this guy.

01:14:28.561 --> 01:14:32.054
We're gonna help this guy.
This kid's getting railroaded.

01:14:37.537 --> 01:14:38.504
Holy...

01:14:39.839 --> 01:14:42.331
You don't talk. I talk.

01:14:42.508 --> 01:14:44.203
They're just gonna look around.

01:14:45.444 --> 01:14:46.844
You got any guns in the house?

01:14:49.215 --> 01:14:51.183
Yeah, we're... we're in Georgia.

01:14:51.784 --> 01:14:54.014
Yeah, of course you do. Go get them.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.353
Lay them on your bed so we can see them.
We don't want any surprises.

01:14:59.392 --> 01:15:01.383
How many of them are coming in here?

01:15:01.861 --> 01:15:02.691
Uh...

01:15:04.297 --> 01:15:05.855
There... There's a couple.

01:15:07.233 --> 01:15:09.565
Can they leave their shoes
outside the door?

01:15:10.603 --> 01:15:14.096
Well, I could ask them, Bobi.
I don't know if they would oblige.

01:15:14.173 --> 01:15:16.107
Oh, God.

01:15:21.180 --> 01:15:22.580
Oh, good Lord.

01:15:23.616 --> 01:15:25.880
Um...

01:15:29.388 --> 01:15:31.914
Were you expecting a zombie invasion
or something?

01:15:32.124 --> 01:15:36.323
No, I wasn't expecting zombies.
I expect deer. I hunt.

01:15:36.495 --> 01:15:38.623
You hunt? Okay.

01:15:38.698 --> 01:15:40.325
Radar, let me explain something to you.

01:15:40.399 --> 01:15:42.231
All you're guilty of right now

01:15:42.301 --> 01:15:44.964
is looking like the kind of guy
who might set off a bomb.

01:15:45.037 --> 01:15:49.805
But everything you do that
promotes that image is gonna hang us.

01:15:50.309 --> 01:15:52.573
Sorry. Poor choice of words.

01:15:53.546 --> 01:15:57.380
Those jackals out there,
they want your ass on a chopping block.

01:15:57.984 --> 01:16:00.509
I just...
Is there anything else odd or quirky

01:16:00.686 --> 01:16:04.486
or fucking weird
that I'm gonna discover today?

01:16:04.991 --> 01:16:06.185
Yeah, kind

01:16:08.995 --> 01:16:12.954
I haven't paid my taxes
in about a couple years.

01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:15.863
This gets better and better.

01:16:16.469 --> 01:16:20.496
Guns, guns, guns. I hate guns.

01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.040
Every time Richard goes hunting, I say,

01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:25.873
"Don't you dare drag
a dead Bambi in here.

01:16:26.012 --> 01:16:27.809
I don't wanna eat Bambi."

01:16:28.714 --> 01:16:29.807
But you know what?

01:16:30.082 --> 01:16:33.917
Richard, when he was deputy with
the Habersham County Sheriffs,

01:16:34.186 --> 01:16:37.315
he got 98 out of 100
on his shooting test.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:40.488
It was awesome. Mmm-hmm.

01:16:43.162 --> 01:16:44.152
That's great.

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:46.862
-Okay.

01:16:47.033 --> 01:16:49.297
You don't talk. I talk. Say it.

01:16:49.602 --> 01:16:51.001
I don't talk.

01:16:52.104 --> 01:16:54.630
But I want those guys to know that

01:16:54.707 --> 01:16:56.971
I'm law enforcement, too.
Just like them.

01:16:57.276 --> 01:16:59.745
See, right there?

01:16:59.912 --> 01:17:03.178
That's talking.
That's what we don't want, okay?

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.180
You picked the right lawyer, Richard.

01:17:18.431 --> 01:17:19.523
We all set?

01:17:19.699 --> 01:17:21.394
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go. Come on.

01:17:22.401 --> 01:17:23.664
Let's start in the back.

01:17:24.337 --> 01:17:26.498
Bring it in. Let's go.
By the numbers, everybody.

01:17:26.572 --> 01:17:27.562
By the numbers.

01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:28.903
Hold on.

01:17:29.709 --> 01:17:30.835
Okay.

01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:35.170
Okay.

01:17:35.348 --> 01:17:38.112
Yeah, so, you guys go ahead
and take everything.

01:17:38.184 --> 01:17:41.449
Take the carpet, whatever you need.
I'm law enforcement, too, so I get it

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:43.318
Just know that whatever you take,

01:17:43.389 --> 01:17:45.585
it's just gonna prove
that I didn't do anything.

01:17:46.592 --> 01:17:47.923
Yeah, we've done this before.

01:17:48.627 --> 01:17:50.755
You'll be counsel, Mr. Bryant?

01:17:51.297 --> 01:17:52.924
That's the plan, yeah.

01:17:53.232 --> 01:17:55.428
All right, if you're gonna stay here,
you're gonna have to put these on.

01:17:55.501 --> 01:17:57.265
Yeah, let's go. Gloves and booties.

01:17:57.336 --> 01:17:58.235
Yeah.

01:17:58.371 --> 01:18:00.430
You heard the man. Booties and gloves.

01:18:27.099 --> 01:18:29.830
Watson,
they're taking my Tupperware.

01:18:29.902 --> 01:18:33.361
All right, let's play ball
right now. We'll get it back.

01:18:33.706 --> 01:18:37.404
If y'all need help finding anyth
feel free to ask one of us.

01:18:37.476 --> 01:18:38.739
We can help.

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.777
Just trying to help.

01:18:44.316 --> 01:18:45.443
It's in there.

01:18:53.659 --> 01:18:55.354
You ever read that book?

01:18:56.829 --> 01:18:59.093
Got a lot in it about police procedure.

01:19:00.166 --> 01:19:02.760
It's a good one.
It's kind of controversial.

01:19:07.506 --> 01:19:08.701
It's a good book.

01:19:12.178 --> 01:19:13.611
It's a good book.

01:19:15.281 --> 01:19:17.374
I can help you with that.

01:19:18.951 --> 01:19:20.680
I babysit with those.

01:19:22.988 --> 01:19:24.615
You know what?
Actually, it might be easier

01:19:24.690 --> 01:19:26.317
if you guys just waited outside
while we did our jobs.

01:19:26.492 --> 01:19:28.016
- Good idea Yeah, let's do that
- Thank you.

01:19:28.227 --> 01:19:30.127
Let's do that, Richard.
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:19:30.296 --> 01:19:31.320
Thank you.

01:19:32.031 --> 01:19:33.498
Johnson, Rosario, anything?

01:19:41.674 --> 01:19:43.005
What was the agreement?

01:19:44.076 --> 01:19:46.511
That I wouldn't talk.

01:19:47.413 --> 01:19:48.744
Yeah, whafd you do?

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:50.575
I talked.

01:19:54.753 --> 01:19:57.348
They wanna fry you. You understand that?
You know that, right?

01:19:57.723 --> 01:19:59.452
Everyone here wants to fry you.

01:19:59.859 --> 01:20:01.588
You're a little piece of bacon.

01:20:03.829 --> 01:20:05.991
Well, on a lighter note,

01:20:06.432 --> 01:20:10.494
you never did tell me the name
of the firm you moved to and whatnot

01:20:11.036 --> 01:20:12.766
I opened my own.

01:20:12.838 --> 01:20:14.329
What made you do something like that?

01:20:14.707 --> 01:20:18.473
Firms mean partners, and partners
think they can tell you who to be.

01:20:18.644 --> 01:20:20.339
I don't care much for being dictated to.

01:20:20.412 --> 01:20:22.278
Hey! You have no right

01:20:22.448 --> 01:20:24.007
- Come back here.
- Mama, what's wrong?

01:20:24.083 --> 01:20:26.279
They went through my underthings.

01:20:26.552 --> 01:20:28.884
How much indignity
do they want us to take?

01:20:29.021 --> 01:20:31.581
All right, Bobi.
Hey, hold on, fellas. Excuse me.

01:20:33.025 --> 01:20:34.049
Mama, hey...

01:20:34.527 --> 01:20:36.586
Bobi. Excuse me, fellas.

01:20:36.762 --> 01:20:37.729
Bobi.

01:20:37.897 --> 01:20:39.194
- Excuse me.
- What did they take from you?

01:20:39.365 --> 01:20:40.696
Hold on now. Hold on.

01:20:40.866 --> 01:20:43.199
Bobi,
let me take care of it for you.

01:20:43.369 --> 01:20:44.893
Can I take care of it for you?

01:20:45.070 --> 01:20:47.733
gonna go get them. Excuse me.

01:20:47.907 --> 01:20:49.101
What can you share with us?

01:20:49.775 --> 01:20:53.040
They found some
really dangerous pantyhose, apparently.

01:20:53.212 --> 01:20:54.475
-Yeah.

01:20:55.648 --> 01:20:56.808
Richard.

01:20:56.982 --> 01:20:58.973
Come here for a sec.
I want to talk to you.

01:21:00.786 --> 01:21:02.220
- Come on inside.
- Yes, sir.

01:21:02.388 --> 01:21:03.787
What can I help with?

01:21:03.956 --> 01:21:05.651
Just come on inside. Just for a second.

01:21:08.661 --> 01:21:09.685
What did they pull out of the house?

01:21:09.762 --> 01:21:11.059
Did he do it, Watson?

01:21:11.230 --> 01:21:14.222
No, he did not. Richard Jewell is
an innocent man. He's a hero.

01:21:14.300 --> 01:21:16.325
If he's innocent,
then why is the FBI here?

01:21:18.971 --> 01:21:21.497
We welcome the FBI.
We're glad they're here.

01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:23.203
No, you don't.

01:21:27.012 --> 01:21:28.343
You know that's not true, Kathy.

01:21:28.414 --> 01:21:30.280
Can I see those boxes, please?

01:21:32.751 --> 01:21:34.185
All right, here's what we're gonna do.

01:21:34.420 --> 01:21:36.616
I'm gonna hand you this phone,

01:21:36.689 --> 01:21:38.782
and when I do,
you're gonna wait till the beep

01:21:38.958 --> 01:21:40.687
and then you're gonna say into it,

01:21:40.859 --> 01:21:43.920
"There's a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes."

01:21:44.029 --> 01:21:44.996
I'm, uh...

01:21:45.130 --> 01:21:47.497
I'm sorry, Why?

01:21:47.666 --> 01:21:50.431
We need a voice exemplar.
Like you to say it a few times.

01:21:50.603 --> 01:21:52.662
"There's a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes."

01:21:52.838 --> 01:21:54.602
It might be the only way
to clear your name.

01:21:55.774 --> 01:21:59.836
I do wanna help y'all.
I'm law enforcement, too.

01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:03.505
Well, yeah. Then you should know
how evidentiary this is, right?

01:22:03.682 --> 01:22:06.151
So, "There's a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes."

01:22:06.318 --> 01:22:08.048
"30 minutes." Okay.

01:22:12.024 --> 01:22:13.787
- After the beep?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.227 --> 01:22:19.027
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:19.331 --> 01:22:20.958
Okay, one more time.
Just a little louder.

01:22:23.636 --> 01:22:27.504
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:28.307 --> 01:22:30.036
Okay, that's great.
Can you do it one more time?

01:22:30.109 --> 01:22:32.202
Maybe let's do a series.
We'll do a couple in a row.

01:22:34.647 --> 01:22:35.773
All right.

01:22:37.383 --> 01:22:40.978
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:41.420 --> 01:22:44.856
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:49.093
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:49.662 --> 01:22:53.029
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.
You have 30 minutes.

01:22:53.198 --> 01:22:55.690
There is a bomb in Centennial Park.

01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:57.995
Are you fucking kidding me?
No, no, you don't talk to him.

01:22:58.070 --> 01:22:59.094
It's standard procedure, they said.

01:22:59.171 --> 01:23:00.536
No, hell it is.

01:23:00.773 --> 01:23:02.070
- In Russia.
- Mr. Bryant, listen.

01:23:02.374 --> 01:23:04.001
Your client volunteered this.

01:23:04.443 --> 01:23:06.707
bullshit. Maybe you can do this.
Maybe you can't.

01:23:06.779 --> 01:23:08.371
You're not doing it today.
Let's go, Richard.

01:23:08.547 --> 01:23:09.776
- Let's go.
- I told them I'm doing it

01:23:09.848 --> 01:23:11.282
if it helps clear my name.

01:23:11.383 --> 01:23:13.613
- Let's go! Not today.
- Your client agreed to this.

01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:15.717
I'm gonna sue your ass...

01:23:15.788 --> 01:23:17.051
- for intentional violation...
- Okay.

01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:18.886
- ...of his constitutional rights.
- Okay.

01:23:19.058 --> 01:23:21.925
I'm having all this shit excluded.
You guys are full of shit

01:23:22.294 --> 01:23:23.284
Let's go.

01:23:25.698 --> 01:23:26.687
We got it.

01:23:39.812 --> 01:23:41.075
Oh, God.

01:23:46.685 --> 01:23:47.675
Have a good night.

01:23:47.753 --> 01:23:49.585
What do they want
with the vacuum cleaner?

01:23:50.055 --> 01:23:52.149
All right We're done here.

01:24:00.299 --> 01:24:01.289
Richard?

01:24:03.302 --> 01:24:05.930
I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine.

01:24:06.105 --> 01:24:07.072
What's wrong?

01:24:07.139 --> 01:24:08.299
Let's get you inside.

01:24:09.074 --> 01:24:10.769
Dave, can you get her
something to drink?

01:24:10.943 --> 01:24:12.740
- Maybe some water?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:24:18.250 --> 01:24:19.445
What's going on?

01:24:22.254 --> 01:24:23.653
It's nothing.

01:24:24.189 --> 01:24:25.247
I'm fine.

01:24:44.076 --> 01:24:45.942
They took all my Tupperware.

01:24:46.645 --> 01:24:49.342
What would they need with my Tupperware?

01:24:49.681 --> 01:24:53.311
The bomber used Tupperware
to hold the nails.

01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:54.819
That's standard.

01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:59.953
Well, what does that
have to do with you?

01:25:00.225 --> 01:25:03.684
And they took my babysitting tapes.
My Disney movies.

01:25:03.862 --> 01:25:06.991
Yeah, I think they did that
because they wanted to see

01:25:07.166 --> 01:25:09.498
if we mighfve recorded something
on the tapes

01:25:09.568 --> 01:25:11.434
like a political statement or something.

01:25:12.104 --> 01:25:15.972
Why do you keep defending these people?

01:25:16.308 --> 01:25:18.402
I'm not defending. I'm just explaining.

01:25:18.577 --> 01:25:21.103
Well, stop it!

01:25:28.153 --> 01:25:29.883
- Hey, there she is. Hey.
- Hi.

01:25:30.255 --> 01:25:31.484
- How you doi
- Hello.

01:25:31.723 --> 01:25:34.249
This is, uh... This is Nadya
She is, uh...

01:25:35.194 --> 01:25:36.422
She tells me what to do.

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:38.427
Here. Let me take that.
That's very nice of you.

01:25:38.597 --> 01:25:40.690
I thought you might want some dinner.

01:25:40.866 --> 01:25:42.061
Bless your heart.

01:25:43.101 --> 01:25:44.569
- Thank you.
- Of course.

01:25:45.404 --> 01:25:47.702
Hi, I'm... I'm Richard.

01:25:48.407 --> 01:25:50.102
What did I tell you about talking, Rich?

01:25:50.209 --> 01:25:51.039
Oh.

01:25:51.343 --> 01:25:54.108
Oh, God, yeah.
I guess I can't talk anymore.

01:26:01.453 --> 01:26:03.922
Come on, Richard,
you can't hide anymore.

01:26:07.793 --> 01:26:10.193
- Richard, one question. That's all.
- Did you do it?

01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.796
Richard,
how many bombs have you made?

01:26:24.009 --> 01:26:26.944
What did the FBI
take out of your house, Richard?

01:26:49.334 --> 01:26:50.165
Yeah.

01:27:26.305 --> 01:27:27.465
Hand grenade?

01:27:27.973 --> 01:27:30.840
- What do you got a hand grenade for?
- Yeah, it's hollowed out

01:27:30.943 --> 01:27:34.174
It's a paperweight. I bought it
from a military surplus store.

01:27:34.346 --> 01:27:36.007
- Yeah.
- But it's nothi

01:27:36.415 --> 01:27:38.246
Christ, of course you did.

01:27:40.118 --> 01:27:41.313
Piece of the bench?

01:27:41.987 --> 01:27:44.820
Splintered piece of...
What does that mean? What is that?

01:27:44.890 --> 01:27:49.191
Yeah, I took a small piece
of the bench from the crime scene.

01:27:49.494 --> 01:27:52.623
- From where the bomb was?
- It's a souvenir. A memento.

01:27:53.198 --> 01:27:54.324
What'd you do that for?

01:27:54.599 --> 01:27:58.263
I think it was a pretty memorable night
where I did something pretty great.

01:27:58.337 --> 01:28:01.795
So, I thought maybe
that was worth holding on to.

01:28:02.074 --> 01:28:03.735
Wow. Okay.

01:28:04.509 --> 01:28:05.442
Nice.

01:28:15.654 --> 01:28:16.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:17.022 --> 01:28:19.821
They want your hair now,
and your palm prints.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:22.886
Good times.

01:28:23.996 --> 01:28:25.156
Come in.

01:28:31.703 --> 01:28:33.933
25 pulled, 25 collected.

01:28:34.106 --> 01:28:35.664
I tell you, you might have
a warrant for this,

01:28:35.741 --> 01:28:38.039
but if you were to do this to me,
you'd have to fight me.

01:28:39.511 --> 01:28:41.946
You'd have to beat the shit out of me!

01:28:42.014 --> 01:28:43.413
Not very lawyerly of you, counselor.

01:28:43.482 --> 01:28:44.472
Yeah, well...

01:28:44.549 --> 01:28:47.280
Can we just get this over with
before my mama comes back?

01:28:47.419 --> 01:28:49.114
I'd like her not to see this.

01:28:56.461 --> 01:28:57.952
Tell me, Richard,

01:28:58.930 --> 01:29:01.229
you still proud to be law enforcement?

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:05.661
You know what?
Maybe if I did my job a little better,

01:29:05.971 --> 01:29:07.905
and got people far enough away,

01:29:07.973 --> 01:29:10.703
then I wouldn't be
sitting here right now.

01:29:11.877 --> 01:29:15.336
Yeah, he's a real monster.
Boy, you guys nailed it.

01:29:15.647 --> 01:29:20.107
Have you dummies done the math yet
on the call from the pay phone?

01:29:20.252 --> 01:29:22.846
Hey, listen, fuck the pay phone! Okay?

01:29:22.921 --> 01:29:25.413
My clients were the people
in the park that night

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:28.221
that didn't deserve to get
their fucking heads blown off.

01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:30.822
You know, I actually feel
sorry for you guys.

01:29:30.896 --> 01:29:33.092
When the real bomber does it again,

01:29:33.165 --> 01:29:35.099
and the country asks,
"Where was the FBI?"

01:29:35.167 --> 01:29:37.931
You're gonna say, "We were busy getting
hair samples from Richard Jewell.11

01:29:38.236 --> 01:29:40.296
- I'm done here.
- All set? Great

01:29:40.739 --> 01:29:41.672
Oh, good.

01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:44.810
Well, Richard, thank you very much
for your professional consideration.

01:29:44.876 --> 01:29:46.469
You know, cop to cop.

01:29:46.912 --> 01:29:48.072
"We're the FBI."

01:29:48.847 --> 01:29:51.316
I got your cop to cop. Right here.

01:29:51.483 --> 01:29:52.609
- Uh-huh.
- There's the door.

01:29:52.784 --> 01:29:54.081
Found it Thank you.

01:29:56.655 --> 01:29:59.351
Richard, we need to be a little less

01:30:00.859 --> 01:30:05.126
solicitous and a little more
righteous with these assjacks.

01:30:05.297 --> 01:30:08.960
I mean, it's just hairs.
They'll grow back. It's fine.

01:30:10.135 --> 01:30:11.330
Whafd you say?

01:30:12.137 --> 01:30:14.367
They're just hairs. They'll grow back.

01:30:15.207 --> 01:30:16.196
They're just hair. Hey!

01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.374
Why doesn't this shit make you
as angry as it makes me?

01:30:20.545 --> 01:30:21.842
I am angry.

01:30:22.114 --> 01:30:23.741
You could have fooled me.

01:30:23.815 --> 01:30:25.181
You're angry?

01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:27.519
'Course I am.

01:30:28.286 --> 01:30:32.621
I don't know if "angry" is even
a big enough word for how I feel.

01:30:33.792 --> 01:30:36.352
- Come on.
- Then stop being such a doormat.

01:30:36.895 --> 01:30:38.158
Stop trying to be their best friend.

01:30:38.230 --> 01:30:39.720
You know, they're making
fun of you out there.

01:30:39.798 --> 01:30:41.322
- You know what they're calling you?
- I know that!

01:30:41.399 --> 01:30:44.426
I know what it means
when he says "cop to cop."

01:30:44.503 --> 01:30:46.130
He doesn't mean cop to cop.

01:30:46.204 --> 01:30:48.605
- He thinks I'm the Pillsbury Doughboy.
- Do you? Could have fooled me.

01:30:48.673 --> 01:30:50.335
I thought you guys
were gonna get engaged.

01:30:51.343 --> 01:30:54.403
Hey! Richard!
You go for a cookie right now,

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:57.071
I'm gonna chop off your hands
and shove them up your ass!

01:30:58.416 --> 01:31:00.317
Try eating a cookie then, fucker.

01:31:02.187 --> 01:31:04.656
Why'd you wanna represent me
and be my lawyer?

01:31:04.823 --> 01:31:06.916
Hey, you looked like
you needed some help.

01:31:07.192 --> 01:31:11.060
You look like you might've needed
money from a book deal.

01:31:11.129 --> 01:31:12.563
Well, let me ask you, why'd you pick me?

01:31:12.631 --> 01:31:14.997
There's a lot of lawyers in the
phone book. Whafd you pick me for?

01:31:15.066 --> 01:31:16.864
I picked you because
you were the only one

01:31:16.935 --> 01:31:18.698
at the US Small Business Admin bureau

01:31:18.837 --> 01:31:21.101
who didn't treat me like
a five-year-old, and call me,

01:31:21.273 --> 01:31:23.469
"bag of snacks" and "blimp,"

01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:25.703
"Michelin Man/1
and "Pillsbury Doughboy."

01:31:25.777 --> 01:31:29.236
You're the only one who treated me
like a human being!

01:31:29.848 --> 01:31:34.217
And now you're just yelling at me,
telling me to be somebody that I'm not!

01:31:34.386 --> 01:31:36.081
I don't know how to be that guy!

01:31:36.154 --> 01:31:38.145
You're that guy! I'm me!

01:31:47.866 --> 01:31:48.890
What?

01:31:53.939 --> 01:31:55.964
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:32:03.248 --> 01:32:05.011
Oh, my Lord.

01:32:05.617 --> 01:32:07.915
How can they do that?

01:32:08.587 --> 01:32:12.387
easy because you don't matter.

01:32:13.458 --> 01:32:14.721
That's how come.

01:32:27.839 --> 01:32:31.400
We need to go!

01:32:32.410 --> 01:32:34.743
Move!

01:32:36.615 --> 01:32:40.016
You guys gotta

01:32:44.089 --> 01:32:47.991
We need to evacuate!

01:33:46.251 --> 01:33:47.616
Mr. Dutchess.

01:33:48.286 --> 01:33:49.219
You got a minute?

01:33:50.588 --> 01:33:51.749
I got that.

01:33:52.891 --> 01:33:53.755
There you go.

01:33:53.925 --> 01:33:55.154
- Can I finish my food?
- Nope.

01:33:56.995 --> 01:33:58.724
Mmm. That's good.

01:34:03.568 --> 01:34:05.400
They've decided that since

01:34:05.470 --> 01:34:08.064
you can't have placed
the 911 call yourself

01:34:08.506 --> 01:34:10.600
that you must've had a partner.

01:34:10.742 --> 01:34:15.270
They think your partner
must be your homosexual boyfriend,

01:34:15.347 --> 01:34:17.315
which they decided is probably me.

01:34:19.951 --> 01:34:21.146
What?

01:34:22.187 --> 01:34:23.620
They asked me to wear a wire.

01:34:25.924 --> 01:34:28.757
I told them to shove it.
I said you were a hero.

01:34:28.827 --> 01:34:30.590
And they said,
"Well, if he really is a hero,

01:34:30.662 --> 01:34:32.926
then he's got nothing to worry about
and neither do you."

01:34:34.499 --> 01:34:37.958
They also told me that, uh,
one of your GBI buddies

01:34:38.036 --> 01:34:40.562
you know, the one you made lasagna
for when he came over...

01:34:40.638 --> 01:34:41.662
Yeah, Miller.

01:34:41.740 --> 01:34:42.866
Yeah.

01:34:43.274 --> 01:34:44.264
Yeah.

01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.508
He was wearing a wire, too.

01:34:47.545 --> 01:34:49.241
He's got a lot on you.

01:34:54.386 --> 01:34:57.378
There's,
one other thing.

01:34:59.958 --> 01:35:03.621
They asked me if I'd ever had
any experience with pipe bombs

01:35:03.695 --> 01:35:05.629
and I had to tell them the truth.

01:35:07.232 --> 01:35:08.529
You know, the little ones.

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:12.002
We used to drop them down gopher holes
when I was a kid in West Virginia

01:35:12.670 --> 01:35:14.229
David... Lord.

01:35:14.472 --> 01:35:17.339
I told them this was years
before I even met Richard.

01:35:17.409 --> 01:35:19.775
I told them a couple times.

01:35:21.012 --> 01:35:22.002
Still...

01:35:23.548 --> 01:35:24.811
I'm sorry.

01:35:30.021 --> 01:35:32.149
It's okay. Yeah.

01:35:33.391 --> 01:35:34.825
Yep.

01:35:39.898 --> 01:35:41.889
It's okay.

01:35:41.966 --> 01:35:42.831
I did what was...

01:35:46.838 --> 01:35:48.738
Hey, turn...

01:35:48.907 --> 01:35:51.034
Come on! What are you doing?

01:35:52.777 --> 01:35:56.145
We can't be watching movies
with bombs and explosions

01:35:56.214 --> 01:35:57.841
when they're listening.

01:35:59.684 --> 01:36:00.845
Come...

01:36:08.526 --> 01:36:09.960
Y'all...

01:36:11.095 --> 01:36:14.122
I'm... I'm trying to do the right thing.

01:36:14.299 --> 01:36:15.562
Right?

01:36:16.301 --> 01:36:18.633
Guys... Are they not listening?

01:36:27.645 --> 01:36:29.978
Hey, Mama, I'm sorry.

01:36:32.717 --> 01:36:34.583
Mama, I'm sorry.

01:36:34.652 --> 01:36:35.984
Please?

01:36:36.421 --> 01:36:40.119
Mama, come on out.
We can watch whatever you wanna watch.

01:36:41.159 --> 01:36:43.059
I don't mind.

01:36:43.728 --> 01:36:45.093
Mama, please, I...

01:36:45.930 --> 01:36:48.058
I won't say nothing about anything.

01:36:48.132 --> 01:36:49.862
Just come on out.

01:36:55.139 --> 01:36:56.664
Mama, I'm sorry. I'm...

01:36:57.275 --> 01:36:58.834
Please?

01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:00.444
Mama, please?

01:37:11.589 --> 01:37:12.579
I know.

01:37:13.124 --> 01:37:14.615
I'm scared, Richard.

01:37:16.294 --> 01:37:17.887
I'm right there with you.

01:37:19.097 --> 01:37:20.428
It's all right.

01:37:22.767 --> 01:37:27.000
I don't know how to protect you
from these people.

01:37:28.373 --> 01:37:32.366
Hey, you know... You know what?
You don't have to protect me.

01:37:32.677 --> 01:37:35.806
I do the protecting. I do.

01:37:36.314 --> 01:37:37.645
Yep.

01:37:38.983 --> 01:37:40.713
Come on. Come on out

01:37:40.885 --> 01:37:42.819
You just sit down.
You watch whatever you wanna watch.

01:37:42.887 --> 01:37:44.446
I don't care.

01:37:44.722 --> 01:37:46.122
I don't care.

01:37:48.626 --> 01:37:50.595
And I'm sorry I yelled.

01:37:54.832 --> 01:37:59.861
Yeah, she's had about three days
to be proud of her son

01:38:00.004 --> 01:38:03.031
and then taken away from her.

01:38:04.175 --> 01:38:06.234
Yep. That ain't right

01:38:07.011 --> 01:38:08.411
sorry, Richard.

01:38:14.052 --> 01:38:15.349
Hey.

01:38:17.455 --> 01:38:19.287
You ready to start fighting back?

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:23.391
Yeah.

01:38:42.347 --> 01:38:43.712
Richard!

01:38:43.881 --> 01:38:46.111
Are you here to turn yourself in?

01:38:52.690 --> 01:38:55.990
Don't see why we can't just let
the FBI do this.

01:38:56.461 --> 01:38:58.554
You trust them with the results?

01:38:59.230 --> 01:39:01.699
You're in good hands here. Just breathe.

01:39:04.302 --> 01:39:08.102
Richard, whose idea was it
for you to take a polygraph test?

01:39:08.606 --> 01:39:09.698
Watson's.

01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:11.372
How do you think you'll do on it?

01:39:11.442 --> 01:39:12.637
Fine.

01:39:17.115 --> 01:39:18.981
Do you know who put that bomb
in Olympic Park?

01:39:25.323 --> 01:39:29.555
No, I do not know who planted the bomb
in Centennial Park.

01:39:32.964 --> 01:39:33.988
Hey, maybe we better talk-

01:39:34.065 --> 01:39:35.499
Nah. He passed.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.399
Highest level. No deception indicated.

01:39:38.469 --> 01:39:40.301
Oh, Jesus Christ

01:39:41.339 --> 01:39:43.569
my God.

01:39:43.641 --> 01:39:45.769
Thanks, man. Hey.

01:39:46.477 --> 01:39:47.570
Thank you.

01:39:47.645 --> 01:39:49.909
Hey. Look at you, huh?

01:39:49.981 --> 01:39:51.414
You did it, man.

01:39:51.582 --> 01:39:53.881
- Yeah, we did it
- You did it.

01:39:54.052 --> 01:39:55.644
We must be firm in this.

01:39:55.720 --> 01:39:58.314
We cannot be intimidated
by acts of terror.

01:39:58.656 --> 01:40:01.250
/ want to thank
the brave security personnel.

01:40:02.527 --> 01:40:04.154
Cocaine use is up
from women in their 60s.

01:40:04.328 --> 01:40:05.159
Oh, yeah?

01:40:05.329 --> 01:40:06.592
- Yeah. Look at that.
- Lucky them.

01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.691
Holy shit, it's Jewell.

01:40:10.868 --> 01:40:11.995
Is that Kathy Scruggs?

01:40:12.603 --> 01:40:13.593
Hey.

01:40:13.771 --> 01:40:16.001
Is this what it's like
behind the curtain?

01:40:16.541 --> 01:40:18.134
- Richard Jewell here.
- Hello.

01:40:18.309 --> 01:40:20.607
We're just about to go
demand a retraction.

01:40:20.678 --> 01:40:22.373
Then we're gonna go get a hamburger.
You wanna come?

01:40:22.447 --> 01:40:24.005
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:40:24.382 --> 01:40:26.817
This is, like, top-rate science fiction.

01:40:26.984 --> 01:40:28.976
"Bomb suspect sought limelight.11

01:40:29.153 --> 01:40:31.884
Are you kidding me?
Who the hell do you think you are?

01:40:32.056 --> 01:40:34.025
Mr. Bryant, what I do
is I report the facts.

01:40:34.158 --> 01:40:36.149
- You lead the public, is what you do.
- I report the facts.

01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:38.329
- The facts?
- That's right That's what I do.

01:40:38.496 --> 01:40:41.955
- You ignorant, arrogant, ambitious...
- Excuse me? Excuse me?

01:40:42.166 --> 01:40:43.793
How did you get this job?

01:40:44.202 --> 01:40:45.897
- How'd I get this job?
- Yeah.

01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:48.098
Mr. Bryant, if you have an issue,
you can take it up with the FBI

01:40:48.206 --> 01:40:49.537
- for investigating your client.
- Oh, bullshit.

01:40:49.607 --> 01:40:50.972
It has nothing to do with me. All right?

01:40:51.042 --> 01:40:53.602
What I do is, I hear the facts,
I report them.

01:40:53.678 --> 01:40:55.578
- That is my responsibility.
- The facts? What about the truth?

01:40:55.646 --> 01:40:57.911
My guiding principle
is to report the facts.

01:40:58.015 --> 01:40:59.176
What fucking principles?

01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:01.241
This isn't a principle
standing next to me.

01:41:01.319 --> 01:41:04.084
Fuck your principle.
This man's name is Richard Jewell.

01:41:04.155 --> 01:41:06.351
- He's a hero. He saved lives.
- You're unbelievable

01:41:06.457 --> 01:41:07.584
- just coming in here.
- I'm unbelievable?

01:41:07.658 --> 01:41:10.821
Do you have any idea
what kind of wildfire you started?

01:41:11.195 --> 01:41:13.061
You've ruined this man's life.

01:41:13.731 --> 01:41:15.495
- Maybe you owe him an apology.
- Listen...

01:41:15.566 --> 01:41:16.590
How about that?

01:41:16.667 --> 01:41:20.001
- Mr. Jewell...
- You know, you are a... What?

01:41:20.071 --> 01:41:22.904
I said I'm sorry for what you
and your mother have gone through.

01:41:22.974 --> 01:41:25.739
You are a miserable
excuse for a journalist.

01:41:25.843 --> 01:41:26.936
You're a parasite.

01:41:27.011 --> 01:41:29.571
Anything to sell a goddamn paper,
you know that?

01:41:30.515 --> 01:41:32.779
Why don't you go chase
another ambulance?

01:41:33.284 --> 01:41:34.547
Kiss my ass.

01:41:38.756 --> 01:41:39.689
He's out of order.

01:41:39.757 --> 01:41:41.817
Vail can go back to work.
There's nothing really to watch here.

01:41:41.893 --> 01:41:43.690
You can just keep doing your jobs.

01:42:26.737 --> 01:42:28.171
He didn't do it.

01:42:32.577 --> 01:42:33.510
Oh, fuck.

01:42:41.519 --> 01:42:43.646
You got a lot of
fucking nerve sitting here.

01:42:43.821 --> 01:42:45.346
Jewell couldn't have made the call.

01:42:45.990 --> 01:42:47.480
The math is wrong.

01:42:47.558 --> 01:42:49.253
I covered the distance from the site
to the phones.

01:42:49.327 --> 01:42:51.727
There's no way
he would have made it in time.

01:42:52.930 --> 01:42:54.091
Yeah, we know.

01:42:55.433 --> 01:42:56.593
You know?

01:42:57.702 --> 01:42:58.862
He had an accomplice.

01:42:59.837 --> 01:43:00.827
An accomplice?

01:43:00.905 --> 01:43:02.168
Sure. Why not?

01:43:02.974 --> 01:43:05.534
What about the lone bomber profile?

01:43:05.610 --> 01:43:07.874
The wannabe cop? With an accomplice?

01:43:07.945 --> 01:43:11.279
Well, first of all, profiles are
always just ajumping-off point.

01:43:11.549 --> 01:43:14.814
Oklahoma City had two bombers,
if you remember.

01:43:15.353 --> 01:43:17.753
Okay, so who did it? Who is it?

01:43:17.955 --> 01:43:20.652
Like I'm gonna tell you
after the way you burned me.

01:43:20.825 --> 01:43:24.158
Fine. Til just write that the case
against Jewell is starting to weaken.

01:43:24.228 --> 01:43:26.856
Bad facts, et cetera. See how that goes.

01:43:27.498 --> 01:43:29.557
You know what?
I'm not sure where you get this idea

01:43:29.634 --> 01:43:33.400
that I work for you,
or that we work together.

01:43:34.805 --> 01:43:36.671
I don't even know
why I'm fucking talking to you.

01:43:36.741 --> 01:43:39.267
I know why. And you need me
just as much as I need you.

01:43:40.678 --> 01:43:42.077
You know what, sweetheart?

01:43:42.847 --> 01:43:44.474
I don't need you a goddamn bit.

01:43:55.960 --> 01:43:57.723
Can I have one more, please?

01:44:01.332 --> 01:44:03.425
Next to me is Bobi Jewell,

01:44:03.935 --> 01:44:06.335
mother of Richard Jewell.

01:44:07.705 --> 01:44:09.935
By some savage twist of fate,

01:44:10.007 --> 01:44:14.604
Richard Jewell has been wrongfully and
falsely accused of murder and mayhem.

01:44:16.180 --> 01:44:20.617
Her son's accusers are two of the most
powerful forces in the world today.

01:44:21.552 --> 01:44:25.546
The United States government
and the media.

01:44:25.856 --> 01:44:29.292
For the past four weeks,
these horrific forces have combined

01:44:29.460 --> 01:44:32.987
to make her
daily existence a living hell.

01:44:34.131 --> 01:44:38.125
As I speak, they continue to crush
the very life out of her

01:44:39.136 --> 01:44:40.866
and her only son.

01:44:40.938 --> 01:44:43.032
I introduce Barbara Jewell,

01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:46.642
the 113th victim
of the Centennial bombing.

01:44:57.154 --> 01:44:59.419
My name is Barbara Jewell.

01:45:00.257 --> 01:45:04.888
I am employed as a claims coordinator
with a local insurance agency

01:45:04.962 --> 01:45:07.488
and I have worked there for 13 years.

01:45:08.899 --> 01:45:11.164
Approximately four weeks ago,

01:45:11.335 --> 01:45:14.237
over 100 people were injured

01:45:14.405 --> 01:45:16.430
and two people lost their lives

01:45:17.808 --> 01:45:21.267
as a result of the Olympic Park bombing.

01:45:21.645 --> 01:45:25.912
My heart goes out to these victims
and their families.

01:45:28.853 --> 01:45:31.117
I am so very drained.

01:45:33.157 --> 01:45:38.061
I hope and pray to God that nobody
ever has to go through this again.

01:45:39.530 --> 01:45:41.498
I do not think any of you can even

01:45:41.565 --> 01:45:44.296
begin to imagine
what our lives are like.

01:45:46.437 --> 01:45:48.428
The media has portrayed my son

01:45:50.174 --> 01:45:53.508
as the person
who has committed this crime.

01:45:55.446 --> 01:45:58.609
They have taken all privacy from us.

01:45:59.150 --> 01:46:01.175
They have taken all peace.

01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:06.814
They watch and photograph
everything we do.

01:46:08.726 --> 01:46:09.716
Like the media,

01:46:10.561 --> 01:46:14.156
the FBI follows his every move

01:46:14.698 --> 01:46:18.328
and watches my home constantly.

01:46:18.969 --> 01:46:20.266
And why?

01:46:21.405 --> 01:46:22.805
My son...

01:46:33.384 --> 01:46:35.648
My son is innocent.

01:46:38.155 --> 01:46:41.284
Richard is not the Olympic Park bomber.

01:46:42.993 --> 01:46:45.223
Richard is not a murderer.

01:46:45.896 --> 01:46:48.661
He saved people's lives.

01:46:51.969 --> 01:46:56.133
Please hear me, Mr. President,
and help me.

01:46:57.274 --> 01:47:00.107
You have the power
to end this nightmare.

01:47:01.112 --> 01:47:03.273
My son is a hero.

01:47:04.448 --> 01:47:07.748
I think the FBI knows that by now.

01:47:10.087 --> 01:47:13.353
If they do not intend to charge my son,

01:47:13.891 --> 01:47:15.518
please tell us.

01:47:16.627 --> 01:47:18.652
Please tell the world.

01:47:19.730 --> 01:47:21.391
Mr. President...

01:47:59.436 --> 01:48:00.734
You did good.

01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.932
Richard.

01:48:09.713 --> 01:48:11.375
Oh, Mama.

01:48:12.016 --> 01:48:14.678
Oh, thank you for doing that.

01:48:18.289 --> 01:48:19.813
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:48:21.158 --> 01:48:23.422
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I cried.

01:48:23.694 --> 01:48:25.287
I didn't mean to cry.

01:48:25.362 --> 01:48:27.592
No, you did real good.
You did better than good.

01:48:28.699 --> 01:48:29.928
You ready?

01:48:30.968 --> 01:48:33.198
Let's go show them who you are.

01:48:34.705 --> 01:48:35.695
Oh, God.

01:48:36.440 --> 01:48:38.306
I'm so glad that's over.

01:48:38.475 --> 01:48:39.636
You did good.

01:48:50.621 --> 01:48:52.146
All right.

01:49:36.333 --> 01:49:37.733
Gentlemen, please have a seat.

01:49:37.901 --> 01:49:39.096
We'll be right with you.

01:49:49.346 --> 01:49:50.780
All right, let me tell you
how it's gonna go.

01:49:50.848 --> 01:49:54.181
They're gonna ask to see me first,
set the ground rules.

01:49:54.285 --> 01:49:57.277
I wanna make sure they know I'm not gay.

01:49:59.423 --> 01:50:02.484
Richard, I think
we got bigger fish to fry,

01:50:02.726 --> 01:50:05.355
but you'll get the chance
to tell them that.

01:50:05.529 --> 01:50:06.894
I'm sure.

01:50:09.266 --> 01:50:10.597
Agent Shaw.

01:50:22.112 --> 01:50:24.775
Dare you to see
if he's got any Snickers.

01:50:25.716 --> 01:50:26.706
Kind of hungry.

01:50:28.385 --> 01:50:30.581
You know what a 1001 is, Radar?

01:50:32.056 --> 01:50:34.718
Yes, sir. It's lying to a federal agent

01:50:34.792 --> 01:50:35.850
It's a felony.

01:50:36.126 --> 01:50:38.652
You say anything in there
that isn't true,

01:50:38.729 --> 01:50:41.255
they can put you in jail
without ever proving you're a bomber.

01:50:41.332 --> 01:50:42.162
Hey.

01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.801
You don't know what to say,
you say nothing.

01:50:45.969 --> 01:50:48.996
You ask for a five-minute break,
you consult with me.

01:50:49.173 --> 01:50:51.107
You do not improvise.

01:50:51.175 --> 01:50:52.301
You got that?

01:50:53.777 --> 01:50:54.767
Yes, sir.

01:50:54.845 --> 01:50:57.405
So if you don't know what to say,
what do you do?

01:50:57.514 --> 01:50:59.141
- I don't say a damn thi
- That's right

01:50:59.216 --> 01:51:00.240
Mr. Bryant?

01:51:21.071 --> 01:51:22.129
Can I help you?

01:51:22.306 --> 01:51:24.775
I was taking a look.

01:51:30.981 --> 01:51:32.745
How do you guys wanna handle this?

01:51:35.452 --> 01:51:37.477
We're gonna ask you some questions,
and you're gonna give us some answers.

01:51:37.554 --> 01:51:38.749
How's that sound?

01:51:40.057 --> 01:51:41.149
Okay.

01:51:41.892 --> 01:51:43.121
Sounds good.

01:51:43.761 --> 01:51:45.251
I'll go get him.

01:51:46.797 --> 01:51:48.560
Hey, you ready, boyo?

01:51:48.632 --> 01:51:49.599
Yeah.

01:51:49.733 --> 01:51:50.894
I think so. Yeah.

01:51:50.968 --> 01:51:52.060
No, I mean ready.

01:51:52.136 --> 01:51:55.401
Look at these guys not as
suspect to agent, but as cop to cop.

01:51:55.472 --> 01:51:57.634
Don't give them any more deference
than they're due.

01:51:57.741 --> 01:52:00.210
- And don't keep calling them "sir."
- Yeah, well,

01:52:00.277 --> 01:52:02.405
they're still the
United States government.

01:52:02.479 --> 01:52:04.209
No, they aren't
the United States government

01:52:04.281 --> 01:52:06.648
They're just three pricks who work
for the United States government

01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:07.808
You understand the difference?

01:52:07.918 --> 01:52:11.286
Nobody in that room
is a better man than you.

01:52:11.455 --> 01:52:12.615
You understand?

01:52:13.190 --> 01:52:14.316
Come on.

01:52:14.625 --> 01:52:15.922
You'll be fine.

01:52:21.365 --> 01:52:22.992
That's it Sit right there.

01:52:23.467 --> 01:52:24.457
Right here?

01:52:24.535 --> 01:52:25.524
Yeah.

01:52:35.646 --> 01:52:36.943
Thank you for joining us.

01:52:37.014 --> 01:52:39.779
Uh, Mr. Jewell,
we've got a few questions

01:52:39.850 --> 01:52:42.785
regarding the events of July 27th, 1996,

01:52:42.953 --> 01:52:44.284
as you probably know.

01:52:44.455 --> 01:52:47.322
Specifically the bombing
in Centennial Park.

01:52:53.897 --> 01:52:56.389
Mr. Jewell, you ever find yourself

01:52:56.567 --> 01:53:01.231
accessing an Internet site
called Candyman's Candyland

01:53:01.405 --> 01:53:05.239
regarding the contents
of The Anarchist Cookbook?

01:53:05.642 --> 01:53:07.542
No, I have not.

01:53:08.212 --> 01:53:11.238
But you do have police training
in handling explosives?

01:53:11.748 --> 01:53:13.273
Asked and answered.

01:53:14.218 --> 01:53:15.708
Did you ever collect any pieces of pipe

01:53:15.853 --> 01:53:19.414
from the construction
of Centennial Park?

01:53:20.457 --> 01:53:22.289
No, I did not.

01:53:22.626 --> 01:53:25.596
Do you remember
telling anybody at the park,

01:53:25.963 --> 01:53:29.023
"Take my picture now, because
pretty soon I'm gonna be famous"?

01:53:29.666 --> 01:53:30.690
No, sir.

01:53:31.001 --> 01:53:32.025
Really?

01:53:32.336 --> 01:53:33.735
You sure about that?

01:53:34.705 --> 01:53:36.195
100%.

01:53:38.375 --> 01:53:39.467
How about, did you say,

01:53:39.543 --> 01:53:42.535
"I'm on my way to Atlanta
It's gonna be a mess out there"?

01:53:43.313 --> 01:53:45.907
I was referring to the traffic jams.

01:53:47.384 --> 01:53:48.715
Mr. Jewell,

01:53:48.986 --> 01:53:53.048
why specifically did you want to be
stationed at that sound and light tower?

01:53:54.057 --> 01:53:56.720
I just liked listening to the music

01:53:57.461 --> 01:53:59.793
and, the night before,
I got to bring my mama down.

01:53:59.897 --> 01:54:03.025
We got to listen to Kenny Rogers.

01:54:03.600 --> 01:54:05.796
She liked that. That was nice.

01:54:06.703 --> 01:54:10.504
And I guess
I also get a nice vantage point

01:54:10.807 --> 01:54:13.276
to take a look at all the pretty girls.

01:54:14.878 --> 01:54:16.608
I am not a homosexual.

01:54:16.914 --> 01:54:18.814
And neither is David Dutchess.

01:54:20.317 --> 01:54:22.649
So you and David Dutchess
are not lovers?

01:54:22.986 --> 01:54:24.044
Asked and answered.

01:54:25.822 --> 01:54:27.723
Mr. Jewell, you said before

01:54:27.925 --> 01:54:30.325
that in your comings and goings
back and forth

01:54:30.494 --> 01:54:32.087
from the stage to the tower

01:54:32.162 --> 01:54:35.894
that you couldn't get an exact fix
on the time. Is that correct?

01:54:38.936 --> 01:54:41.871
Yes, but when you have the runs,

01:54:41.939 --> 01:54:44.032
which I did, excuse me,

01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:46.368
you're not thinking about
what time it is.

01:54:46.443 --> 01:54:48.673
You're just trying to

01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:52.406
crab-walk to a bathroom, you know?

01:54:53.283 --> 01:54:55.445
So you don't remember the exact time

01:54:55.519 --> 01:54:58.955
that you saw the drunks throwing
the beer cans against the tower?

01:54:59.122 --> 01:55:00.021
Right?

01:55:00.991 --> 01:55:02.254
No.

01:55:02.626 --> 01:55:05.357
You don't remember the exact time
you first saw the backpack?

01:55:06.129 --> 01:55:07.426
That's correct.

01:55:07.664 --> 01:55:10.031
You ever seen a backpack
like that before, Mr. Jewell?

01:55:10.701 --> 01:55:12.794
Yeah, I suppose so. Yeah.

01:55:12.970 --> 01:55:15.530
You ever see that specific
backpack before, Mr. Jewell?

01:55:15.806 --> 01:55:16.773
Asked and answered.

01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:17.807
Can we move on?

01:55:17.975 --> 01:55:19.169
Mr. Jewell...

01:55:20.444 --> 01:55:23.709
Did you conspire
with David Dutchess or anybody else

01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:26.941
to plant a bomb in Centennial Park?

01:55:39.796 --> 01:55:40.889
No.

01:55:41.198 --> 01:55:44.657
Then how the fuck did you know to be
on the other side of that AT&T tower

01:55:44.735 --> 01:55:46.862
where you knew you'd be protected
from the blast?

01:55:47.638 --> 01:55:49.970
A bomb went off
right where you were stationed.

01:55:50.173 --> 01:55:52.108
Chaos erupts. Bodies hit the ground.

01:55:52.175 --> 01:55:54.041
Cops go flying. Hell, I was one of them.

01:55:54.911 --> 01:55:56.675
You come out without a goddamn scratch.

01:55:56.747 --> 01:55:58.339
How does that happen, Richard?

01:56:06.590 --> 01:56:08.717
Can I ask all you fellas a question?

01:56:08.825 --> 01:56:10.816
Jesus. What?

01:56:13.997 --> 01:56:17.024
Do you have any kind of case against me?

01:56:18.869 --> 01:56:20.496
I mean evidence.

01:56:20.704 --> 01:56:26.006
Like, any traces of anything
on my mama's Tupperware?

01:56:26.076 --> 01:56:31.640
Or did you find any bomb-making
materials in her apartment?

01:56:31.815 --> 01:56:34.011
did you find some-
- Hey, hey. Hey.

01:56:34.184 --> 01:56:35.674
Richard, we don't need to volunteer-

01:56:35.752 --> 01:56:38.119
I'm gonna say this
if I'm gonna say anything.

01:56:38.188 --> 01:56:43.592
I walk in here and I look at the circle
decal on your windows there,

01:56:43.694 --> 01:56:45.127
and I'm thinking...

01:56:45.295 --> 01:56:49.459
I... I used to think that
federal law enforcement

01:56:49.533 --> 01:56:53.526
was just about the highest calling
a person could aspire to.

01:56:54.237 --> 01:56:56.900
And I'm not sure I think that anymore,
you know?

01:56:56.973 --> 01:56:58.373
Not after all this.

01:57:01.678 --> 01:57:03.305
I did my job that night,

01:57:03.380 --> 01:57:06.315
and some people are alive
because of that.

01:57:07.718 --> 01:57:10.243
Do you think that the next time
some security guard

01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:12.084
sees a suspicious package,

01:57:12.289 --> 01:57:14.758
that he or she's gonna call it in?

01:57:15.792 --> 01:57:16.782
I doubt it.

01:57:17.828 --> 01:57:19.989
You know? 'Cause they're gonna
look at that and they're gonna think,

01:57:20.464 --> 01:57:22.989
"I don't wanna be
another Richard Jewell...

01:57:23.166 --> 01:57:24.793
So I'm just gonna run."

01:57:27.104 --> 01:57:29.470
How's that make anybody any safer?

01:57:31.975 --> 01:57:34.342
Y'all can keep following me
around some more

01:57:34.411 --> 01:57:36.573
doing what you're doing. I can stand it.

01:57:36.646 --> 01:57:40.174
But I just know that
every second you spend on me

01:57:40.250 --> 01:57:42.719
is time that you're not spending
on the real guy who did it,

01:57:42.786 --> 01:57:44.379
and it's like Watson said...

01:57:47.023 --> 01:57:48.719
What happens when he...

01:57:51.428 --> 01:57:53.726
What happens when he does it again?

01:58:02.873 --> 01:58:08.243
So, do you have anything
you wanna charge me with?

01:58:14.151 --> 01:58:15.448
Can you?

01:58:26.296 --> 01:58:27.286
Well...

01:58:28.732 --> 01:58:30.461
I think it's time to

01:59:01.798 --> 01:59:02.925
How'd he do?

01:59:02.999 --> 01:59:04.331
He did great.

01:59:07.270 --> 01:59:08.363
God.

01:59:09.706 --> 01:59:10.696
Yeah.

01:59:13.710 --> 01:59:14.734
Go on.

01:59:29.359 --> 01:59:30.190
Hey.

01:59:30.293 --> 01:59:31.283
Gentlemen.

01:59:32.062 --> 01:59:33.325
Agent Shaw.

01:59:33.563 --> 01:59:34.929
Got something for

01:59:35.198 --> 01:59:36.325
What's this?

01:59:36.733 --> 01:59:37.996
Marriage proposal.

01:59:38.702 --> 01:59:39.532
Oh.

01:59:40.470 --> 01:59:41.801
My lucky day.

01:59:47.477 --> 01:59:48.535
Okay.

01:59:48.712 --> 01:59:50.043
Well, this is a good start.

01:59:50.113 --> 01:59:52.480
When's the press conference?
I'm assuming you'll be

01:59:52.549 --> 01:59:55.416
announcing to all the news outlets,
Tom Brokaw and the like.

01:59:55.752 --> 01:59:57.652
Mr. Bryant, let me be perfectly clear.

01:59:58.655 --> 02:00:00.953
I still think your client
is guilty as hell.

02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:08.293
Have a nice day.

02:00:09.766 --> 02:00:12.064
Well, you're entitled to your opinion.

02:00:22.012 --> 02:00:25.106
"This is to advise you that
based on the evidence..."

02:00:29.719 --> 02:00:30.812
It's over.

02:00:32.656 --> 02:00:33.919
Is...

02:00:33.990 --> 02:00:39.326
Is it really over or is this
just another one of their things?

02:00:41.331 --> 02:00:43.094
You won. It's over.

02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:11.525
You did good.

02:01:16.866 --> 02:01:20.234
I wanna see...
I wanna see Mama.

02:01:20.570 --> 02:01:21.662
You wanna see Mama?

02:01:21.738 --> 02:01:22.762
Yeah.

02:01:25.308 --> 02:01:26.571
We can do that.

02:01:31.915 --> 02:01:33.246
That's real?

02:01:36.653 --> 02:01:38.086
That's what it says.

02:01:40.256 --> 02:01:43.249
"...not considered a target
in the federal criminal investigation

02:01:43.426 --> 02:01:46.919
of the bombing of July 27th, 1996,

02:01:47.130 --> 02:01:48.598
Centennial Park."

02:01:54.237 --> 02:01:55.261
Hey.

02:01:55.372 --> 02:01:56.430
Hey.

02:01:58.074 --> 02:01:59.064
Hey.

02:02:00.877 --> 02:02:02.072
Thank you.

02:02:02.679 --> 02:02:03.908
Thank you.

02:02:05.582 --> 02:02:06.947
You got it.

02:02:10.387 --> 02:02:11.581
Thank you.

02:02:13.056 --> 02:02:14.046
Hey.

02:02:18.695 --> 02:02:20.925
Hey.

02:03:42.579 --> 02:03:44.445
Hello, Watson Bryant

02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:45.611
Hey.

02:03:45.682 --> 02:03:47.047
What can I do you for?

02:03:47.117 --> 02:03:49.051
How are you? How's, uh...

02:03:49.385 --> 02:03:50.944
My God, how's Nadya?

02:03:51.121 --> 02:03:52.782
They found him, Richard.

02:03:53.223 --> 02:03:54.247
Found who?

02:03:54.524 --> 02:03:56.083
Eric Rudolph.

02:03:58.194 --> 02:04:00.823
He confessed to the bombing
at Centennial Park.

02:04:03.733 --> 02:04:05.895
You know when he's being arraigned?

02:04:06.903 --> 02:04:07.734
I don't know.

02:04:07.904 --> 02:04:10.464
- Can you find out for me?
- Yeah.

02:04:12.696 --> 02:04:13.789
Look at you.
