MAN: Okay kids, who
wants Manning Coleslaw?

00:10.895 --> 00:14.919
And/or an explanation of why that's...

00:15.290 --> 00:16.351
funny.

00:16.471 --> 00:18.647
Sorry, guys, we're, um...

00:20.263 --> 00:21.670
closed, yeah.

00:21.790 --> 00:24.287
Thanks for getting aside from me because

00:24.407 --> 00:25.519
we are closed.

00:25.639 --> 00:28.284
Especially now that the door is locked.

00:28.566 --> 00:31.356
And you're not really supposed
to be back here.

00:31.476 --> 00:33.381
Even if you have a, a...

00:33.501 --> 00:35.564
- I was gonna say a hairnet.
- Bob?

00:35.853 --> 00:37.664
- Is everything...
- Everything's fine, we're...

00:37.715 --> 00:39.049
- Closed, Bob...
- Linda!

00:39.169 --> 00:41.740
Take the kids in the back.
Kids, go in the back with your mom.

00:42.787 --> 00:44.294
Not really want.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.899
*** goes Linda, now would you please
go in the goddamn back?

00:46.918 --> 00:49.214
Well, excuse me, "Ike Turner".

00:49.735 --> 00:52.917
Look, the hamburger wasn't a big seller,
so there's not much.

00:53.037 --> 00:55.240
- But um...
- We don't want money.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.595
We want you.

00:56.715 --> 00:59.347
- I'm sorry?
- We are not robbers.

00:59.467 --> 01:02.747
Oh, my god. Okay, yes,
you can rob them, but...

01:02.867 --> 01:04.354
just please don't hurt my family.

01:04.474 --> 01:06.709
- We're not robbers.
- Oh.

01:06.829 --> 01:09.437
- Well, then, what do you want?
- You.

01:10.034 --> 01:12.059
- ***.
- Da.

01:12.179 --> 01:13.912
ARCHER: Wh-? No!

GOON 1: Ty sukin syn, ISIS shpion!

01:30.098 --> 01:34.601
Even if you kill us,
more will come, Archer!

01:34.670 --> 01:35.602
ARCHER: Khorosho!

01:35.671 --> 01:38.237
Ya ih toje zamochu togda!

01:41.708 --> 01:42.508
LINDA: Bob!

01:42.577 --> 01:44.610
ARCHER: Oh my God, are you guys okay?!

01:44.679 --> 01:47.813
LINDA: We -- yeah, we're -- but... Bob!

01:47.882 --> 01:49.482
Where'd you learn how to do that?!

01:49.551 --> 01:52.619
ARCHER: I -- I dunno,
it was like, instinct.

01:52.688 --> 01:54.054
LINDA: And were you speaking Russian?!

01:54.123 --> 01:54.888
ARCHER: Was I?

01:54.957 --> 01:57.125
But I don't even know any -- Russian!

01:57.194 --> 02:00.128
Look, the label in his coat has
those idiot Russian letters!

02:00.197 --> 02:01.997
LINDA: Why the hell are
Russians trying to kill you?!

02:02.065 --> 02:03.065
ARCHER: I don't know!

02:03.133 --> 02:05.567
He called me "Archer," maybe
they think I'm somebody else...

02:05.636 --> 02:07.570
LINDA: (gasps) Somebody who gambles?!

02:07.638 --> 02:08.971
ARCHER: When would I gamble, Linda?!

02:09.039 --> 02:10.705
The six hours a night I get to sleep?!

02:10.775 --> 02:14.610
Because the other eighteen hours, I'm
slaving over this hot-ass grill!

02:14.679 --> 02:16.514
LINDA: I didn't know it was
such a burden...

02:16.634 --> 02:19.349
ARCHER: Wh-? Of course it's a burden!

02:19.417 --> 02:23.020
Don't get me wrong, I love you guys,
but come on... I've been here two months,

02:23.088 --> 02:25.723
it feels like two... trillion eons.

02:25.791 --> 02:30.027
LINDA: Well if that's the way you -- what
are you doing, you're not leaving?!

02:30.096 --> 02:31.095
ARCHER: Linda, you heard him!

02:31.164 --> 02:33.031
Whoever they are, he
said they'd keep coming!

02:33.099 --> 02:34.566
You guys aren't safe if I'm around!

02:34.634 --> 02:36.902
LINDA: But Bobby...
ARCHER: No buts.

02:36.970 --> 02:38.503
I'm not gonna let you guys get hurt.

02:38.572 --> 02:41.239
What I am gonna do, is find out
who this Archer jerk is, and

02:41.308 --> 02:43.909
why Russian people want him dead.

02:43.977 --> 02:46.044
I'm also probably gonna do a spa weekend.

02:46.113 --> 02:51.182
Between work and being a stepdad
to Gene and Louise and, um...

02:51.251 --> 02:53.051
anyway, I am just burned out.

02:53.120 --> 02:57.322
So take care, and I'll call after I
solve this mystery, or whatever.

02:57.390 --> 03:00.758
Oh, and I forgot to tell you the health
inspector's coming at eight A.M.,

03:00.827 --> 03:04.096
so you better break out the purple stuff.

03:39.473 --> 03:41.525
MALORY: I'm sorry, I'm
sure I misheard you...

03:41.526 --> 03:43.577
Sterling has been

03:43.646 --> 03:47.448
missing for two months, we've spent God
knows how many thousands of dollars and

03:47.517 --> 03:51.318
manhours searching for him,
and this whole time he's just

03:51.438 --> 03:53.853
down at the shore flipping hamburgers?

03:53.973 --> 03:55.605
You know another kind of burger?

03:55.725 --> 03:57.407
Ostrich. Shut up, they're good.

03:57.527 --> 03:59.136
- Shut up!
- Yes, shut up!

03:59.368 --> 04:02.195
Then explain to me
if you know where Sterling is.

04:02.315 --> 04:03.150
Was.

04:03.270 --> 04:04.706
Oh, according to our intel,

04:04.826 --> 04:07.632
he was tracked down by a KGB hit squad.

04:07.908 --> 04:10.118
- Oh my God!
- Sorry.

04:10.238 --> 04:13.060
I should have started that with
"Archer is fine".

04:13.180 --> 04:14.612
The KGB hit squad...

04:14.847 --> 04:16.785
Oh my God!

04:16.904 --> 04:18.945
- Not so much.
- My God!

04:19.257 --> 04:22.123
- But, so, where is he now?
- At a spa.

04:22.243 --> 04:25.123
According to his... um, wife.

04:25.243 --> 04:27.367
His what?

04:27.487 --> 04:30.046
Linda. She said he's name was Bob.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.482
He wandered in there in full morning dress
2 months ago, they got married,

04:33.602 --> 04:35.778
Married? The minute they met?

04:36.025 --> 04:37.855
- Who does that?
- Ostriches.

04:37.975 --> 04:38.855
Son of a...

04:39.114 --> 04:41.750
He's obviously doing this
just to get even with me.

04:41.870 --> 04:44.688
Normally, I would agree, but after
talking to the wife,

04:44.808 --> 04:46.427
I honestly think Archer

04:46.547 --> 04:48.150
doesn't know he's Archer.

04:48.270 --> 04:50.273
How could he not know who he is?

04:50.327 --> 04:52.529
Psychogenic retrograde amnesia.

04:52.649 --> 04:54.459
Also known as a fluke statement,

04:54.495 --> 04:57.721
sometimes triggered by extreme
emotional or psychological stress.

04:57.841 --> 05:02.881
- And we all know what caused that!
- Yes, his hatred of seeing me happy.

05:03.001 --> 05:04.849
Now take me to that spa!

05:04.969 --> 05:07.666
And we'll just see how
this amnesia holds up

05:07.786 --> 05:11.999
against a sudden and quite possibly
violent confrontation with his mother.

05:12.119 --> 05:14.480
Ba-ba-ba-ba...

05:14.719 --> 05:15.509
Bad idea!

05:15.629 --> 05:18.536
According to my clinical research
on drug induced amnesia...

05:18.656 --> 05:19.926
Said the fake scientist...

05:20.046 --> 05:22.937
- Hmm, and what are your parents' names?
- What?

05:23.159 --> 05:24.320
Their names are...

05:24.440 --> 05:26.456
um, uh...

05:26.576 --> 05:28.954
Damn it, Krieger, did you drug me?

05:29.074 --> 05:30.312
You don't remember?

05:30.570 --> 05:33.495
Wow, memory is such a fragile thing.

05:33.615 --> 05:36.859
And if Archer's real identity
is exposed to him too suddenly,

05:36.979 --> 05:39.383
his mind may reject it permanently.

05:39.503 --> 05:41.293
We have to ease him back into it,

05:41.413 --> 05:43.089
like a latex gimp suit.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.905
And how do you suggest we do that?

05:45.025 --> 05:47.086
Well, some people use baby powder.

05:47.206 --> 05:48.606
I'm a firm believer in corn starch.

05:48.710 --> 05:50.133
Not the gimp suit!

05:50.253 --> 05:52.263
- Sterling's amnesia!
- Oh.

05:52.383 --> 05:54.287
Yes, I have a plant.

05:54.915 --> 05:56.051
Plant?

05:56.286 --> 05:57.051
Plan.

05:57.483 --> 05:58.458
I'm serious.

05:58.578 --> 06:01.506
I want it on record that I think
this is a terrible plan.

06:01.626 --> 06:03.681
Duly noted and disregarded.

06:03.801 --> 06:06.287
And I expect you to be totally convincing.

06:06.407 --> 06:07.867
As the damsel in distress?

06:07.987 --> 06:10.905
Have you ever met a woman less damsel-y?

06:11.025 --> 06:13.253
Pam. And it's not you I'm worried about.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.184
It's our pathetic villains.

06:15.304 --> 06:17.295
Guys! Fake mustache, yay or nay?

06:17.415 --> 06:19.301
- Yay!
- Yeah, it works, right?

06:19.421 --> 06:22.498
My face isn't a naturally
villainous like yours, so...

06:22.618 --> 06:25.675
Here's an idea, why don't you just
saw your goddamn head off?

06:25.795 --> 06:27.335
Geez, what's up your butt?

06:27.455 --> 06:29.150
Nothing is up my butt, Cyril.

06:29.270 --> 06:31.191
Oh, or maybe there is.
I wouldn't know.

06:31.311 --> 06:35.034
Because I'm paralyzed from waist down
and it's Archer's fault!

06:35.154 --> 06:37.812
So, getting some mileage on to that, huh?

06:37.932 --> 06:40.705
Ugh, now damsel up and get over there.

06:40.825 --> 06:43.855
And remember, you have to pretend
you don't have a history together.

06:43.975 --> 06:47.275
For the... Sour mix?

06:47.395 --> 06:48.514
In a margarita?

06:48.634 --> 06:50.761
What is this? Auschwitz?

06:51.487 --> 06:52.969
I always do.

06:53.561 --> 06:56.129
Like a big brown giraffe.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.055
Uh, or an ostrich.

06:59.175 --> 07:01.833
Remind me why I let you idiots come.

07:01.953 --> 07:03.006
For the free rooms?

07:03.126 --> 07:05.276
Cause the only thing you are
more than mean is cheap.

07:05.396 --> 07:06.041
Shut up.

07:06.263 --> 07:08.152
And just because you own this place...

07:08.272 --> 07:09.793
I think I just own the conglomerate

07:09.913 --> 07:12.448
that owns the holding company
that owns the hotel chain that owns it.

07:12.568 --> 07:16.770
Don't even think about screwing up
our plan to cure Sterling's amnesia.

07:16.890 --> 07:17.619
His what?

07:17.739 --> 07:19.977
Five ingredients: tequila,

07:20.097 --> 07:23.876
cointreau, lime juice, ice, koja salt.

07:23.996 --> 07:28.170
Oh, and sorry about the Auschwitz crack.
That's not like me.

07:28.290 --> 07:29.564
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

07:29.684 --> 07:31.725
- I'm not Jewish.
- Did I ask for your life story?

07:31.845 --> 07:33.964
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

07:34.084 --> 07:35.371
Yes. No.

07:35.491 --> 07:37.495
I mean, um, please,

07:37.615 --> 07:40.135
feel free... to... always... do... that.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.071
- Hi, I'm Bob.
- Lana Kane.

07:42.191 --> 07:45.244
And thanks. I just need to rest a minute.
I've been on the run, I mean,

07:45.364 --> 07:47.766
- on the go, and..
- Wait...

07:47.886 --> 07:50.145
- You're on the run too?
- No, I...

07:50.265 --> 07:51.558
Forget I said that.

07:51.678 --> 07:53.510
It's dangerous, and you're married.

07:53.630 --> 07:55.325
- And...
- What, this? No, this...

07:55.445 --> 07:58.508
This is fake, I just wear it
to fend off the cougars.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.866
Like her. She's totally checking me out.

08:00.986 --> 08:02.619
- Eww.
- Ew.

08:02.739 --> 08:04.730
Right? So why are you on the run?

08:04.850 --> 08:06.598
Bob,

08:06.718 --> 08:09.080
have you ever heard of ISIS?

08:09.200 --> 08:12.097
From the Shazam/Isis Hour TV show?

08:12.217 --> 08:14.228
- No, the...
- Remember Shazam?

08:14.348 --> 08:17.432
Wait, who's the actor that
played Billy Batson? Remember, he'd go...

08:17.552 --> 08:19.338
- Shazaaaaam!
- Arch... Bob!

08:19.458 --> 08:20.828
- What?
- ISIS!

08:20.948 --> 08:24.060
Is the International Secret
Intelligence Service

08:24.180 --> 08:26.627
and I'm one of, oh, frankly,

08:26.747 --> 08:27.749
I'm their best agent.

08:27.869 --> 08:30.020
And KGB agents are trying to kill me.

08:30.140 --> 08:31.265
Huh. Me too!

08:31.385 --> 08:33.635
Wait, I wonder if it's related
to your thing.

08:34.029 --> 08:36.251
Wait, why are you at the same spa as me?

08:36.371 --> 08:38.102
I, uh...

08:38.222 --> 08:41.225
Not even the best agent of this pool.

08:41.345 --> 08:43.205
Seriously, how are we both at...

08:43.325 --> 08:45.744
I think I see a KGB agent! Kiss me!

08:51.486 --> 08:53.461
LANA: Okay, he's gone.

08:55.153 --> 08:58.959
ARCHER: Glad I could help...
LANA: I could use more help.

08:59.028 --> 09:01.528
But I have to warn you,
it could be dangerous.

09:01.597 --> 09:04.631
ARCHER: For you, Lana, I will
take the highway right into the

09:04.700 --> 09:06.500
danger zo - oh my God!

09:06.568 --> 09:07.100
LANA: What?!

09:07.169 --> 09:08.568
ARCHER: Michael Gray!

09:08.637 --> 09:09.736
Was Billy Batson.

09:09.805 --> 09:11.904
On Shazam.

09:13.851 --> 09:18.054
MALORY: Krieger, I'm really having second
thoughts about your so-called plan.

09:18.123 --> 09:19.222
KRIEGER: Give it time!

09:19.291 --> 09:21.825
This isn't "The Flintstones",
we can't just whang him in the

09:21.894 --> 09:23.159
head with a frying pan!

09:23.228 --> 09:23.960
GILLETTE: How bout a bullet?

09:24.029 --> 09:24.661
CYRIL: Burn.

09:24.729 --> 09:26.462
MALORY: Oh give it a rest, Ironsides.

09:26.531 --> 09:27.263
CYRIL: Burn.

09:27.332 --> 09:29.131
LANA: And please! Focus!

09:29.200 --> 09:33.470
ARCHER: Sorry, I'm trying, it's just...
TEC-9's are awesome!

09:33.539 --> 09:37.508
[ Brrrrrrrrrrrrrt! ]

09:37.577 --> 09:40.511
Wait, how'd I know these
are called TEC-9's?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.881
LANA: Uh, well --
KRIEGER: Remember, ease him into it!

09:42.950 --> 09:44.249
Like a --
MALORY: Enough!

09:44.318 --> 09:44.950
With the gimp suits!

09:45.019 --> 09:46.485
LANA: Will you shut up?!

09:46.554 --> 09:47.353
KRIEGER: Sorry.

09:47.422 --> 09:50.056
ARCHER: Sorry, it's just I don't know
what's happening, this is all crazy.

09:50.124 --> 09:52.491
I'm a fry-cook, but I
know all about guns?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.695
Russian spies who think my name
is Archer are trying to kill me?

09:55.764 --> 09:57.030
I speak Russian?

09:57.099 --> 10:00.500
Oh, and plus I'm a total
badass at hand-to-hand combat?

10:00.569 --> 10:01.267
LANA: Pff.

10:01.336 --> 10:04.071
ARCHER: No, seriously, I'm
like Chuck Norris-esque.

10:04.140 --> 10:05.739
LANA: Okay, hit me.

10:05.808 --> 10:06.406
ARCHER: What?

10:06.475 --> 10:08.208
Right here, take your best shot.

10:08.277 --> 10:09.176
ARCHER: I'm not gonna hit you.

10:09.245 --> 10:11.579
LANA: Why, is your vagina bothering you?

10:11.648 --> 10:12.280
ARCHER: Okay.

10:12.349 --> 10:13.448
I see what you're doing.

10:13.516 --> 10:15.316
But I warned you.

10:15.384 --> 10:20.721
Hiiiiii --
ARCHER: Ya.

10:20.790 --> 10:22.456
I think you literally broke my heart.

10:22.525 --> 10:24.492
KRIEGER: Aww...
LANA: Shut up.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.093
ARCHER: Sorry.

10:26.162 --> 10:28.899
So yeah, wow, maybe I'm not as
good as I thought...

10:29.019 --> 10:32.866
LANA: Duh. Okay, the first thing we need
to do is search the entire spa for --

10:32.935 --> 10:34.301
ARCHER: An ice machine, totally, yes.

10:34.369 --> 10:35.702
LANA: KGB agents.

10:35.771 --> 10:38.071
Specifically these two.

10:38.140 --> 10:40.240
ARCHER: Did you say gay-GB?

10:40.309 --> 10:42.408
KRIEGER: Aww...
CYRIL: Think it's the mustache?

10:42.477 --> 10:43.309
GILLETTE: It's not helping.

10:43.378 --> 10:45.745
CYRIL: Well neither are you, so --
GILLETTE: To reiterate!

10:45.814 --> 10:46.545
I am paralyzed!

10:46.614 --> 10:47.179
CYRIL: Well?!

10:47.248 --> 10:48.547
Join a support group!

10:48.616 --> 10:51.216
MALORY: For who, crippled
gay hillbilly spies?

10:51.285 --> 10:52.618
GILLETTE: [huge, weary sigh]

10:52.686 --> 10:53.819
MALORY: There's a niche.

10:53.888 --> 10:55.220
Alright you two, you're on.

10:55.289 --> 10:58.857
So try, against all odds,
not to cock it up.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.259
PAM: Speaking of, you see the
bulge on that towel boy?

11:01.328 --> 11:04.129
Man, if I was you I'd be at
this spa twenty-five-eight.

11:04.197 --> 11:07.365
CHERYL/CAROL: Yeah, but then I wouldn't
get to hang out with everybody at work.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.267
PAM: You hate everybody at work.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.301
CHERYL/CAROL: I know.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.570
It's the only thing that gets
me out of bed every morning.

11:12.639 --> 11:13.804
PAM: The hatred.

11:13.873 --> 11:14.539
CHERYL/CAROL: Yes, Pam.

11:14.607 --> 11:15.907
The hatred.

11:15.975 --> 11:18.943
[ contented sigh ]

11:19.012 --> 11:22.914
ARCHER: Man, this spy stuff is awesome,
and I bet I'd be totally awesome at it,

11:22.983 --> 11:24.616
so is ISIS hiring, or...?

11:24.684 --> 11:25.617
LANA: No.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.852
ARCHER: What, is it weird
because we kissed?

11:27.921 --> 11:32.022
LANA: That was weird, and also not a real
kiss, and also never happening again.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.323
ARCHER: Oh, I get it.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.758
You're not into guys.

11:34.827 --> 11:38.629
LANA: O.K. so -- Just because I don't
wanna bang you, automatically I'm a

11:38.697 --> 11:39.463
lesbian?

11:39.531 --> 11:42.399
ARCHER: Yes, well, that
and your Hulk hands.

11:42.468 --> 11:45.903
LANA: I do not, have -- ARCHER:
She-Hulk, then, whatever, they're --

11:45.971 --> 11:46.904
LANA: Arch -- Bob!

11:46.972 --> 11:48.805
ARCHER: What, Jennifer Walters.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.208
Alter-ego of She-Hulk, what.

11:51.276 --> 11:53.042
LANA: KGB agents, twelve o'clock.

11:53.111 --> 11:53.611
ARCHER: Wh-?

11:53.645 --> 11:56.612
CYRIL: Dunt move a
mussels, Amerikyetskis!

11:56.681 --> 11:59.248
ARCHER: And, wait, how
are they a superpower?

11:59.317 --> 12:02.384
CYRIL: Oh no, kepitalist
spy get drup on us!

12:02.453 --> 12:05.587
LANA: Okay, KGB agents, I want
you to reach into your jackets

12:05.655 --> 12:09.090
very slowly and --
KGB AGENT: Drup your weapons!

12:09.159 --> 12:10.792
LANA: Oh, shit.

12:10.860 --> 12:13.828
KGB AGENT: And prepare
to die, Sterling Archer!

12:13.897 --> 12:15.964
ARCHER: Jesus, Mary and Joseph Stalin!

12:16.033 --> 12:24.033
For the last time, assholes,
my name is -- Shazaaaaaaaaaam!

12:24.108 --> 12:27.610
ARCHER: How do you not
remember that show?

12:31.268 --> 12:33.702
ARCHER: So, uh, what's the plan here?

12:33.771 --> 12:35.337
LANA: I don't have a plan!

12:35.406 --> 12:37.472
Because those guys are the real KGB!

12:37.541 --> 12:39.774
ARCHER: What, as opposed
to the fake KGB?!

12:39.843 --> 12:42.009
LANA: Actually yes, and also --

12:44.046 --> 12:45.012
LANA: Fake bullets!

12:45.081 --> 12:47.515
ARCHER: What?!

12:47.584 --> 12:49.150
Why do we have fake bullets?!

12:49.219 --> 12:49.851
LANA: Yeah, Krieger!

12:49.919 --> 12:50.752
Why do we?!

12:50.821 --> 12:53.388
KRIEGER: No no no, you don't know my--
ARCHER: Why do you know the KGB

12:53.457 --> 12:54.422
guy's name?!

12:54.491 --> 12:56.391
LANA: Ugh, because --
KRIEGER: Bup bup bup bup bup!

12:56.460 --> 12:57.292
Gimp suit!

12:57.361 --> 13:00.563
ARCHER: Unless... oh my God, you're KGB!

13:00.632 --> 13:04.901
LANA: Oh for -- if I'm KGB why
is the KGB shooting at me?!

13:04.970 --> 13:07.671
ARCHER: Internal power struggle?

13:07.740 --> 13:09.272
LANA: Dammit! Ray!

13:09.341 --> 13:11.040
LANA: Ray, we are Code Zulu!

13:11.109 --> 13:12.341
MALORY: Code Zulu?

13:12.410 --> 13:13.810
She knows better than that.

13:13.878 --> 13:16.212
Code Zulu is only for real emergencies.

13:16.280 --> 13:17.179
LANA: Raaaaay!

13:17.248 --> 13:18.714
GILLETTE: Yeah, she's
laying it on pretty thick.

13:18.783 --> 13:20.416
MALORY: Well, you're in charge here.

13:20.485 --> 13:22.285
I'm off to get a seaweed wrap.

13:22.353 --> 13:24.086
GILLETTE: Didn't know they
made sushi with dried clams.

13:24.155 --> 13:24.887
MALORY: What was that?!

13:24.956 --> 13:27.390
LANA: The real KG --
GILLETTE: What was that?

13:27.458 --> 13:30.993
I can't hear you over the
sound of mlah blah blah.

13:31.062 --> 13:31.927
LANA: Ray?!

13:31.996 --> 13:32.895
Ray!

13:32.964 --> 13:34.630
What the hell is that sound?

13:34.698 --> 13:37.566
ARCHER: Hamilton Beach 727 DrinkMaster.

13:37.635 --> 13:40.569
And speaking of drinks...
LANA: These aren't to drink, dumbass!

13:40.638 --> 13:42.271
I'm gonna make Molotov cocktails!

13:42.340 --> 13:43.672
ARCHER: Not with Irish cream you're not.

13:43.741 --> 13:46.442
LANA: Will you -- Bob!

13:46.510 --> 13:47.776
Oh my God.

13:47.845 --> 13:50.246
ARCHER: Yeah, it's pretty thick.

13:50.314 --> 13:50.946
LANA: Krieger!

13:51.015 --> 13:52.015
We need suppressing fire!

13:52.049 --> 13:52.569
KRIEGER: Wh-?

13:52.617 --> 13:54.416
We're shooting blanks, duh!

13:54.485 --> 13:55.317
LANA: They don't know that!

13:55.386 --> 13:56.151
Duh!

13:56.220 --> 14:02.091
CYRIL: Burn... Inappropriate,
suppressing fiiiiiire!

14:02.159 --> 14:02.725
LANA: Great!

14:02.794 --> 14:07.763
Just buy us some time, so--
So, I have a question...

14:07.832 --> 14:11.067
Why did you rip off my shirt...
ARCHER: To make the fuses, duh.

14:11.135 --> 14:14.103
LANA: When there's a huge stack of
bar towels right freaking there!

14:14.172 --> 14:15.771
ARCHER: Oh. Duh.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.776
LANA: And, follow-up, why did you
also rip off my bikini top?!

14:19.845 --> 14:21.177
ARCHER: For the slingshot.

14:21.246 --> 14:21.845
LANA: Wh-?!

14:21.914 --> 14:25.683
ARCHER: See, we put the bottle in
the, whatever, the boob cups, and --

14:25.752 --> 14:27.518
LANA: Just throw the damn thing!

14:27.587 --> 14:29.786
ARCHER: Oh my God, double-duh!

14:29.855 --> 14:31.155
Right? Huh?

14:31.223 --> 14:32.923
KGB AGENT: Zahodi s boku!

14:32.991 --> 14:34.557
LANA: Dammit, they're gonna flank us!

14:34.626 --> 14:36.560
So you wanna throw that today, or...?

14:36.628 --> 14:39.295
ARCHER: No, now I feel bad for
setting your bikini on fire.

14:39.364 --> 14:40.096
Here, hold this.

14:40.165 --> 14:40.730
LANA: Wh-?

14:40.799 --> 14:43.866
I don't wanna hold the damn --
ARCHER: Yeah, I think that works--

14:43.935 --> 14:46.153
whoa, I am getting some
major déjà vu here...

14:46.154 --> 14:48.370
LANA: It's not déjà vu,

14:48.439 --> 14:49.638
you idiot!

14:49.707 --> 14:51.073
ARCHER: Well however you pronounce it!

14:51.142 --> 14:52.341
LANA: Rrrgh!

14:52.410 --> 14:54.711
KGB AGENT: Koktyiel Molotova!

14:54.779 --> 14:55.878
ARCHER: Whoooo!

14:55.947 --> 14:57.380
Did you see that?!

14:57.449 --> 15:00.550
LANA: Yes! Here, keep throwing them!

15:00.619 --> 15:01.885
ARCHER: Whoooo!

15:01.953 --> 15:03.620
Another one!

15:03.689 --> 15:09.192
Wait, wait a minute...
MALORY: What in the... is that smoke?

15:09.260 --> 15:09.859
PAM: Duh.

15:09.928 --> 15:10.460
MALORY: Wh-?

15:10.528 --> 15:11.894
Are you out of your mind?!

15:11.963 --> 15:12.895
PAM: Damn near.

15:12.964 --> 15:16.199
This shit is el crónico.

15:16.268 --> 15:18.701
Gracias, Julio, you are the man.

15:18.770 --> 15:20.670
CHERYL/CAROL: And you are also fired.

15:20.739 --> 15:21.779
PAM: What?!
JULIO: Que?!

15:21.840 --> 15:23.473
CHERYL/CAROL: I'm sorry, but
all of my companies have a

15:23.542 --> 15:25.842
zero-tolerance drug policy.

15:25.910 --> 15:28.611
PAM: You hypocrite cooze, I just
watched you eat a whole bag of

15:28.680 --> 15:30.246
LSD gummi bears!

15:30.315 --> 15:32.048
CHERYL/CAROL: Right?

15:32.117 --> 15:34.551
And I am tripping bear balls!

15:34.619 --> 15:37.120
I'm kidding, Julio, you're not fired.

15:37.189 --> 15:39.256
In fact, I'm making you the new GM.

15:39.325 --> 15:40.958
PAM: Aww...
JULIO: General manager?!

15:41.026 --> 15:41.792
Of the spa?!

15:41.861 --> 15:44.461
CHERYL/CAROL: No, dipshit,
of the entire hotel chain.

15:44.530 --> 15:46.430
JULIO: Multinational
Hotels Incorporated?!

15:46.498 --> 15:47.264
CHERYL/CAROL: Oh.

15:47.332 --> 15:48.572
I guess I don't own this place.

15:48.600 --> 15:49.699
MALORY: Damn it!

15:49.768 --> 15:51.567
I have to pay for these rooms.

15:51.636 --> 15:52.301
CHERYL/CAROL: Well?!

15:52.370 --> 15:53.503
LANA: Well what?!

15:53.571 --> 15:57.540
ARCHER: Why do I feel like -- no, why
do I know that we've done this before!

15:57.609 --> 16:01.010
LANA: I, uh, we haven't, um--
ARCHER: Yes we have, Lana!

16:01.079 --> 16:03.874
Throwing bottle bombs, your tits
flopping around...

16:03.994 --> 16:07.850
LANA: Flopping?! Okay, first of all --
ARCHER: Oh my God, what's happening?!

16:07.970 --> 16:10.015
It feels like my brain is exploding!

16:10.135 --> 16:11.237
LANA: Krieger, what's happening?!

16:11.357 --> 16:15.736
KRIEGER: His mind-brain is permanently
rejecting his real identity!

16:15.856 --> 16:16.792
CYRIL: Mind-brain?

16:16.861 --> 16:18.064
KRIEGER: That's a thing, shut up.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.299
Uh, Lana?!

16:19.419 --> 16:19.990
ARCHER: Linda!

16:20.110 --> 16:20.854
LANA: Linda?

16:20.974 --> 16:22.472
ARCHER: You're my wife!
Linda!

16:22.592 --> 16:24.113
And I am Bob!

16:24.233 --> 16:26.422
I am Bob and I make burgers!

16:26.542 --> 16:29.678
KGB AGENT: On liubit burgery...
KGB AGENT 2: Eto yego problema.

16:29.962 --> 16:33.339
ARCHER: Burger Bob, Bob
Bob burger burger...

16:33.340 --> 16:36.715
KGB AGENT: Dosvidaniya, Archer...

16:36.835 --> 16:39.932
LANA: Bob, honey, I need you to get down!

16:40.007 --> 16:42.742
ARCHER: Yes, down to
the store for cheese!

16:42.811 --> 16:44.856
For the Émile Gorgonzola Burger!

16:44.976 --> 16:46.375
LANA: Okay, I have had it.

16:46.495 --> 16:49.008
ARCHER: Well, not with j'accuse-cumbers!

16:51.387 --> 16:53.280
KGB AGENT: Ogon'!

16:53.391 --> 16:54.423
ARCHER: Oww!

16:54.492 --> 16:56.572
What the shit, Lana?!

16:56.692 --> 16:57.424
LANA: Archer?

16:57.493 --> 16:59.359
Wait, are you... you?

16:59.428 --> 17:00.427
ARCHER: Yes, I'm me!

17:00.496 --> 17:01.528
You dumb idiot!

17:01.597 --> 17:03.630
KRIEGER: There goes the
frying pan theory.

17:03.699 --> 17:05.165
ARCHER: Who did you think I was?!

17:05.233 --> 17:08.435
LANA: You, unfortunately...
ARCHER: Unfortunately?!

17:08.503 --> 17:11.371
What's unfortunate is you got
me into a firefight with the

17:11.440 --> 17:17.377
KGB armed with a frickin cap gun!

17:17.445 --> 17:20.146
LANA: Because unfortunately,
we were trying to cure your --

17:20.214 --> 17:22.147
ARCHER: Psychogenic retrograde amnesia!

17:22.217 --> 17:25.751
Duh!

17:25.819 --> 17:29.055
LANA: Wait, so you
remember you had amnesia?

17:29.123 --> 17:32.458
KRIEGER: Such a fragile mystery...
LANA: Krieger, one more word and

17:32.527 --> 17:35.595
I'll make you wish they never scraped
you out of Hitler's drawers.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.162
KRIEGER: Aww...
CYRIL: Ew.

17:37.231 --> 17:38.330
ARCHER: Ew.

17:38.399 --> 17:40.232
That is a lot creamier than I remembered.

17:40.300 --> 17:43.101
LANA: But, you do remember why you
ran away from home this time?

17:43.170 --> 17:46.071
ARCHER: I'm a grown man, Lana,
I didn't run away from home!

17:46.139 --> 17:49.641
I... carjacked a limo.

17:49.709 --> 17:51.276
From a wedding.

17:51.345 --> 17:53.130
Oh my God, it's all
coming back to me now...

17:53.131 --> 17:54.914
What part of this

17:54.983 --> 17:56.949
are you not getting?!

17:57.018 --> 17:57.978
CHAUFFEUR: Core concept?

17:57.985 --> 18:02.722
ARCHER: Drive, shitheel!

18:02.791 --> 18:03.590
MALORY: Wh-?!

18:03.658 --> 18:04.791
Where is the limo going?!

18:04.859 --> 18:07.426
CHERYL/CAROL: I guess
wherever Mr. Archer said to.

18:07.495 --> 18:09.095
MALORY: Son of a bitch!

18:09.163 --> 18:09.962
PAM: Your words.

18:10.031 --> 18:12.765
CYRIL: Burn.

18:12.834 --> 18:14.000
MALORY: Ruined!

18:14.068 --> 18:16.769
Absolutely ruined, because of you!

18:16.838 --> 18:18.371
ARCHER: I said I was sorry, Mother!

18:18.439 --> 18:20.873
MALORY: Happiest day of my life...
ARCHER: Wait, wasn't that the

18:20.942 --> 18:21.607
day I was born?

18:21.676 --> 18:22.809
Oww!

18:22.877 --> 18:23.676
What's in there?

18:23.745 --> 18:24.611
Spa buckles?

18:24.679 --> 18:28.515
MALORY: You think that compares to a dream
wedding to Ron Cadillac, the biggest

18:28.584 --> 18:30.317
Cadillac dealer in New York?!

18:30.386 --> 18:32.386
RON: Technically the
whole tri-state area!

18:32.454 --> 18:34.621
EVERYBODY: [ Cheers ]

18:34.690 --> 18:35.556
RON: Hiya, gang!

18:35.625 --> 18:36.791
MALORY: Oh, Ron!

18:36.859 --> 18:38.726
Thank you for coming so quickly!

18:38.795 --> 18:39.794
PAM: Phrasing, first, boom!

18:39.863 --> 18:43.031
RON: Well, in a Cadillac you don't
have to sacrifice speed for luxury.

18:43.100 --> 18:46.634
That baby'll pass anything on the road...
except a gas station!

18:46.703 --> 18:50.038
EVERYBODY: [genuine laughter]

18:50.106 --> 18:51.227
RON: And how's my lady love?

18:51.274 --> 18:52.807
MALORY: Infinitely better now.

18:52.876 --> 18:55.276
RON: I bet, now that you found Sterling!

18:55.345 --> 18:57.512
She was just worried sick about you.

18:57.581 --> 19:00.415
MALORY: Well, not sick...
RON: How the heck are ya, son?

19:00.484 --> 19:04.619
ARCHER: Fine, awful, whatever, great...
MALORY: But mostly mortified

19:04.688 --> 19:06.020
that he ruined our wedding!

19:06.089 --> 19:09.224
RON: Well... all's well that ends well.

19:09.292 --> 19:12.126
LANA: Yeah, I don't
think it does, though.

19:12.195 --> 19:13.061
ARCHER: No shit.

19:13.129 --> 19:15.963
LANA: No, I mean, the KGB found
you at a burger joint when you

19:16.032 --> 19:18.900
didn't even know who you were,
then they found you here?

19:18.969 --> 19:20.167
How did they do that?

19:20.236 --> 19:24.271
ARCHER: I -- wait, yeah,
how'd they do that?

19:28.377 --> 19:30.511
BARRY: Barry, are we losing our minds?

19:30.580 --> 19:34.481
BARRY: Could be, Other Barry, could be...
Because even though

19:34.550 --> 19:37.284
I can see Archer's every
frickin move, apparently it's

19:37.353 --> 19:40.554
impossible to kill that
idiot from frickin space!

19:40.623 --> 19:44.658
So where are we on the frickin
spaceship to get me home?!

19:44.727 --> 19:46.167
And I'm lookin' your way, Dr. Simon.

19:46.195 --> 19:48.496
SCIENTIST: Uh, well...
BARRY: Lemme stop ya right

19:48.564 --> 19:51.232
there, in case you were about
to say there's been a setback.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.968
Because that's what Dr. Benes
and Dr. Hathaway kept saying.

19:54.037 --> 19:55.470
Remember those guys?

19:55.539 --> 19:58.850
They were workin' with you
guys on my new spaceship?

19:58.970 --> 20:01.577
I murdered them?

20:02.049 --> 20:04.116
ARCHER: Eh, probably just a coincidence.

20:04.184 --> 20:04.850
LANA: Really.

20:04.919 --> 20:06.119
You're going with coincidence.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.621
ARCHER: Yes, Lana, I'm
going with coincidence!

20:08.690 --> 20:11.357
OSTRICH: Do you think that's wise?

20:11.425 --> 20:14.126
CHERYL/CAROL: [ screaming ]

20:14.194 --> 20:16.435
ARCHER: What the hell is your problem?!
