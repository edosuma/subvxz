00:06.053 --> 00:08.521
Booth, you're gonna be fine.

00:08.613 --> 00:13.846
You're gonna make it. Come on. Come on,
Booth. It's gonna be fine. Come on, Booth.

00:13.933 --> 00:16.207
Come on, Booth. No.

00:16.293 --> 00:18.090
No, come on... Come on...

00:18.173 --> 00:24.089
The carbon isotopic composition
of the collagen shows a value of -16% .

00:24.173 --> 00:27.324
Supporting the theory that
the deceased was born in Provence.

00:27.413 --> 00:30.211
- In the 16th century.
- It's time, Dr Brennan.

00:30.293 --> 00:34.809
The metacarpophalangeal joints are smooth,
showing dexterity. Perhaps a musician.

00:34.893 --> 00:37.009
That's enough. We're going. Now.

00:37.093 --> 00:39.527
I have remains to identify.
He could have a family.

00:39.613 --> 00:42.730
He's 500 years old.
They've probably adjusted by now.

00:42.813 --> 00:45.850
I'm not going.
I've already made that clear.

00:46.813 --> 00:49.771
It's Agent Booth's funeral.
Losing a loved one is...

00:49.853 --> 00:52.367
A partner, Sweets. I lost a partner.

00:53.173 --> 00:58.327
Someone close to you. The funeral allows you
to grieve and come to terms with his death.

00:58.413 --> 01:03.407
The Arunta Aboriginals grieve by burning
down their village and moving to a new one.

01:03.493 --> 01:06.166
That's no crazier to me
than gathering around a hole.

01:06.253 --> 01:08.608
- Being hostile won't...
- Brennan, a word.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.969
Excuse me? Professional psychologist?

01:12.893 --> 01:17.125
Look, I know how you see things.
And I respect that.

01:17.213 --> 01:20.285
But I need to ask you a favour.

01:23.253 --> 01:25.448
I have to go to the funeral.

01:25.533 --> 01:27.967
I won't be able
to get through this alone.

01:28.053 --> 01:31.284
I've been crying for, like, days.

01:31.373 --> 01:34.206
I really need your shoulder here.

01:35.973 --> 01:38.885
I need my best friend.

01:42.693 --> 01:48.563
I knew Seeley Booth. He was a good man
who earned my respect and affection.

01:48.653 --> 01:50.723
And I don't like many people.

01:50.813 --> 01:56.888
Booth had a selfless commitment to his work.
First in the military, and then the FBI.

01:56.973 --> 02:03.003
Two weeks ago, he made the ultimate
sacrifice, giving his life to save his partner.

02:03.853 --> 02:08.973
And in that brave act, he showed us
what greatness we are all capable of.

02:09.053 --> 02:11.965
She was aiming at me.
I would've happily taken that bullet.

02:12.053 --> 02:13.691
I know.

02:13.773 --> 02:20.690
May God's mercy and love shine on Seeley
Booth as he takes his place beside the Lord.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.731
If there were a merciful God,
why didn't he save Booth?

02:29.013 --> 02:30.241
Stand by!

02:30.333 --> 02:33.211
Port arm!

02:41.013 --> 02:43.004
Aim!

02:46.133 --> 02:47.646
Excuse me!

02:47.733 --> 02:49.644
Hey!

02:50.693 --> 02:53.491
What the hell is going on?

02:53.573 --> 02:55.643
They appear to be fighting.

02:57.000 --> 03:03.074

03:11.013 --> 03:13.402
Bones. Nice shot.

03:13.493 --> 03:14.892
What?

03:28.013 --> 03:31.210
The Bureau faked my death
so I could finally get that guy.

03:31.293 --> 03:33.887
- I don't care.
- I drove him underground.

03:33.973 --> 03:36.806
He said we'd only ever see him again
at my funeral...

03:36.893 --> 03:38.167
- I don't care.
- Who is he?

03:38.253 --> 03:41.290
What part of "national security"
don't you understand?

03:41.373 --> 03:44.843
"National security."
Catch-all phrase for "we do what we want".

03:44.933 --> 03:48.323
I knew I shouldn't have gone.
It was a complete waste of time.

03:48.413 --> 03:52.292
- My funeral was a waste of time?
- I thought it was a lovely service, Booth.

03:52.373 --> 03:57.128
- Thanks. I expected more people, though.
- I imagined a lot of ex-girlfriends crying.

03:57.213 --> 03:59.522
- Yeah, me too.
- You guys are pathetic.

03:59.613 --> 04:01.649
I won't be attending your next funeral.

04:01.733 --> 04:06.045
You were supposed to know I wasn't dead.
That's why I thought you weren't crying.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.532
Informed by who?

04:07.613 --> 04:12.243
I gave a list of people to the Bureau to inform.
If they didn't tell you, it's not my fault.

04:12.333 --> 04:16.690
Dr Brennan's upset because she had to face
strong emotions that she'd rather deny.

04:16.773 --> 04:21.130
Striking Booth indicated the depth of your
feelings for him. It was a passionate act.

04:21.213 --> 04:26.162
- Thank you. Did you hear that? Passion?
- Anger at being manipulated is a passion.

04:26.253 --> 04:28.164
-  Dr Brennan?
- Forget it.

04:28.253 --> 04:30.483
Someone left a package for you.

04:39.133 --> 04:41.408
- Oh.
- It's a mandible.

04:43.453 --> 04:45.887
- Look at that, huh?
- Two silver screws.

04:45.973 --> 04:49.443
- Silver screws as in?
- Silver skeleton?

04:49.533 --> 04:50.727
- As in?
- Gormogon?

04:50.813 --> 04:53.202
That's speculation.

04:54.093 --> 04:57.085
- Tooth marks.
- Someone's been snacking on that.

04:57.173 --> 04:58.811
As in cannibalism?

04:58.893 --> 05:02.681
- Cannibalism does not necessarily mean...
- It's Gormogon. Has to be.

05:02.773 --> 05:06.652
Oh, God.
Who has he eaten this time?

05:41.533 --> 05:44.491
This is the fifth known victim
in the Gormogon murders,

05:44.573 --> 05:47.212
all of which have involved
ritualised cannibalism.

05:47.293 --> 05:49.363
- He has apprentices?
- Yes.

05:49.453 --> 05:52.809
One at all times
to help perform the murders,

05:52.893 --> 05:55.453
dispose of the bodies, eradicate evidence.

05:55.533 --> 06:01.449
His mission, it seems, is to construct
a skeleton out of the bones of his victims.

06:01.533 --> 06:03.285
- I've seen enough.
- Booth?

06:03.373 --> 06:06.206
- I'm thinking.
- Thinking about what, exactly?

06:06.293 --> 06:11.048
It's a pickle. The platform's a crime scene, but
we need to access it to investigate the crime.

06:11.133 --> 06:13.363
A cake-and-eat-it-too situation.

06:13.453 --> 06:16.047
- Is it a cake or a pickle?
- It's SchrÃ¶dinger's cat.

06:16.133 --> 06:20.012
That I understand.
Cakes and pickles meant nothing to me.

06:20.093 --> 06:24.609
- Are you paralysed by the paradox, Booth?
- I'll make this easy. What do you need first?

06:24.693 --> 06:26.411
- Identity.
- Let's go, people.

06:26.493 --> 06:28.484
Whoa. OK. Easy.

06:28.573 --> 06:31.565
All right, whoa. You can't...
All right. There you go.

06:32.293 --> 06:35.251
The tooth sockets may contain
enough tissue to check DNA.

06:35.333 --> 06:39.372
- Zack, there are markings on this bone.
- It appears to have been boiled.

06:39.453 --> 06:44.243
I'll see if I can pull any mineral traces that can
help us determine the water he used.

06:44.333 --> 06:50.329
OK. I, uh, give you all permission to do
whatever it is that you squints do.

06:50.413 --> 06:53.246
I'll, uh, just...

06:53.333 --> 06:55.324
Call me.

06:56.133 --> 06:57.122
Let's go.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.244
- I need to talk to you.
- What the hell?!

07:10.333 --> 07:13.882
I'm in my house, in my bathroom,
in my bathtub.

07:14.613 --> 07:18.208
- How did you get in?
- The fake rock by the door is fooling nobody.

07:18.293 --> 07:20.682
Why are you wearing
a hat that dispenses beer?

07:20.773 --> 07:26.086
Hot tub plus cold beer equals warm beer.
Hat equals solution. Why are you?

07:26.173 --> 07:28.164
And that cigar? It's very unhealthy.

07:28.253 --> 07:31.370
What the hell do you want?
Cos I'm not feeling too relaxed.

07:31.453 --> 07:34.604
- You should've told me you weren't dead.
- I explained.

07:34.693 --> 07:38.527
The Bureau has to vet everyone.
I was just following protocol.

07:38.613 --> 07:39.602
- Protocol?!
- Yes!

07:39.693 --> 07:44.562
We've been partners for three years. You've
broken protocol and put my life in danger.

07:44.653 --> 07:48.043
Which makes sense - you clearly
don't have any real concern for me.

07:48.133 --> 07:52.570
- I took a bullet for you!
- Once! That only goes so far!

07:57.693 --> 08:00.526
Would you like a towel?

08:04.973 --> 08:07.009
Fine.

08:07.573 --> 08:11.407
- What is it that I should've done, Bones?
- You could've called me.

08:11.493 --> 08:13.643
Did you really think I needed to be vetted?

08:13.733 --> 08:15.564
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course.

08:15.653 --> 08:19.282
- It must've been something you said.
- I don't know why you weren't told.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.570
But you said I should be.
Aren't you curious why I wasn't?

08:22.653 --> 08:26.805
Yes! Do you want me to find out
why you weren't told?

08:26.893 --> 08:30.408
- If it's important to you.
- Fine. I will.

08:30.493 --> 08:33.371
Next time I die, I promise that I will tell you.

08:33.453 --> 08:36.331
- I'll look forward to that.
- Me too.

08:36.413 --> 08:38.369
What are you reading?

08:38.453 --> 08:40.125
A novel.

08:41.133 --> 08:43.647
It's a graphic novel.

08:43.732 --> 08:49.171
Just so you know, I find your lack
of puritan modesty very refreshing.

08:58.133 --> 09:01.489
The marks on the mandible indicate
the bones have been gnawed on.

09:01.573 --> 09:05.168
- But not with teeth.
- The markings were made by dentures.

09:05.253 --> 09:09.531
A toothless cannibal can't cut it
in today's competitive serial-killer climate.

09:09.613 --> 09:12.923
- How do you know he wore dentures?
- Zack found polymethyl methacrylate,

09:13.013 --> 09:15.846
monomer, and tetrasilicic fluoromica
on the mandible.

09:15.933 --> 09:18.766
I'm gonna assume
that's what dentures are made of.

09:18.853 --> 09:21.447
But not commercial dentures
from the dentist.

09:21.533 --> 09:23.728
Main ingredient
is polymethyl methacrylic.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.805
- These were home-made.
- I got our victim's DNA results.

09:26.893 --> 09:29.646
- Is it the lobbyist?
- Yup. Gormogon's last victim.

09:29.733 --> 09:32.691
I was wondering when
some part of him would show up.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.924
- What's that sucking sound?
- This is my house, OK?

09:36.013 --> 09:39.403
You come into my house,
there's no telling what you'll hear!

09:39.493 --> 09:44.487
Dr Saroyan, regarding the denture medium,
if we recreate the process...

09:44.573 --> 09:47.133
It could tell us
about Gormogon's resources.

09:47.213 --> 09:49.647
If you want to do
one of your experiments, just say.

09:49.733 --> 09:52.486
We want to do one of our experiments.

09:52.573 --> 09:56.532
Go. Make plastic cannibal dentures.

09:57.853 --> 10:00.447
- Place the jawbone in the skeleton.
- Why?

10:00.533 --> 10:05.368
It keeps an interactive relationship with
the killer. That's why he provided the screws.

10:05.453 --> 10:08.604
We give him something, he reciprocates.

10:08.693 --> 10:11.605
Did you see me on TV?
No one has mentioned I was on TV.

10:11.693 --> 10:14.127
How would he know
if we added the jawbone?

10:14.213 --> 10:17.489
He has some way of finding out.
Which is another reason to do it.

10:17.573 --> 10:20.212
You are purposely
not mentioning my appearance.

10:20.293 --> 10:24.411
For all we know, Gormogon is dead and we're
not on the list of people who get to find out.

10:24.493 --> 10:26.961
- A cry for attention.
- Bones broke into my house...

10:27.053 --> 10:30.329
- There was a key!
...angry because no one told her I was dead.

10:30.413 --> 10:32.722
- I was just following protocol.
- Broke in?

10:32.813 --> 10:34.849
- There was a key.
- Barged into my bathroom.

10:34.933 --> 10:37.493
- What were you doing?
- Drinking beer, reading a comic.

10:37.573 --> 10:41.122
- I was taking a bath.
- You read comics and drink beer naked?

10:41.213 --> 10:46.128
Wait a second. Bones bursts into <i>my</i>
bathroom and I'm weird for being naked?

10:46.613 --> 10:51.289
This thermoplastic has a melting point
of approximately 1800Â° Fahrenheit.

10:51.373 --> 10:55.764
This would work better if we made a paste of
the monomer and polymethyl methacrylate.

10:55.853 --> 10:57.969
That would entail complicated cosolvents

10:58.053 --> 11:01.363
to allow copolymerisation
without substantial phase separation.

11:01.453 --> 11:05.082
The monomer's melting point
is far below the polymethyl methacrylate.

11:05.173 --> 11:07.607
You just sat there naked?

11:07.693 --> 11:10.605
It's my bathroom.
What do you wear in the tub? Floaties?

11:14.893 --> 11:17.965
- Ready for the monomer?
- Yes. I believe so.

11:18.053 --> 11:22.251
- The mould is on the side table.
- You get it. I'll mix in the monomer.

11:22.333 --> 11:27.407
No, I'll mix it in. Please hand me
the monomer, then the mould.

11:30.373 --> 11:32.443
Since when did I become
the assistant?

11:32.533 --> 11:36.412
Since I became
the uncontested king of the lab.

11:50.133 --> 11:52.522
Hey, hey!

11:53.853 --> 11:58.005
-  Hodgins...
- I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm OK.

11:58.093 --> 12:00.163
-  Oh, my God.
-  Oh, God.

12:00.253 --> 12:04.485
Zack? A medical team's on its way.
Oh, my... I'll get the burn kit.

12:04.573 --> 12:08.327
- Is he OK?
- He's in shock, Bones. Look at his hands.

12:12.173 --> 12:13.811
Zack?

12:18.333 --> 12:19.402
Zack?

12:23.253 --> 12:26.882
- Is Hodgins OK?
-  He's fine. Just a few minor cuts.

12:26.973 --> 12:29.487
Don't worry.
You're gonna be as good as new.

12:29.573 --> 12:32.167
That would be impossible.
The damage is...

12:32.253 --> 12:35.563
- We'll get you the best doctors.
- The cartilage is destroyed.

12:35.653 --> 12:38.486
In addition, the trapezoid and hamate
on my left hand...

12:38.573 --> 12:42.646
- Hey, how about a little optimism?
- I know that I can still be quite useful.

12:42.733 --> 12:45.884
Mentally, I'm still exceptional.
And with prostheses...

12:45.973 --> 12:47.964
Hey.

12:48.933 --> 12:53.290
- How are you, Zack?
- Quite severely injured. Are you all right?

12:53.373 --> 12:55.762
I'm OK, man.

12:55.853 --> 12:58.925
Hey, anything you need, Zack, just ask.

12:59.013 --> 13:02.608
- Do you know how it happened?
- I just added three grams of monomer.

13:02.693 --> 13:07.892
That doesn't make sense. There was no amide
or carbonyl in the monomer, was there?

13:07.973 --> 13:11.090
- No. Just phenylethene.
- I thought so. And the PMMA was...

13:11.173 --> 13:15.803
- Hodgins, he has third-degree burns.
- The doctor said you should rest, Zack.

13:15.893 --> 13:18.965
She's right.
Hey, we're gonna figure this out, OK?

13:19.053 --> 13:21.931
You won't be alone.
One of us will be here all the time.

13:22.013 --> 13:24.846
- That's not necessary.
- Yes, it is.

13:24.933 --> 13:27.686
Because we... love you.

13:30.453 --> 13:35.129
- I'll take the first shift.
- And I'll write us a schedule.

13:35.213 --> 13:39.809
I'll get you whatever you need
to keep your job. We'll get through this.

13:39.893 --> 13:41.531
Thank you, Dr Brennan.

13:50.613 --> 13:54.401
A simple monomer wouldn't explode.
It just wouldn't happen.

13:54.493 --> 13:58.008
Isn't the FBI handling the analysis
of the explosive residue?

13:58.093 --> 14:01.642
Excuse me if my faith in the Bureau
isn't absolute.

14:01.733 --> 14:05.567
- So you don't trust Agent Madison?
- I'm just getting my own results.

14:05.653 --> 14:09.123
I'm sure he's... fine.
But I'm... independent.

14:09.933 --> 14:12.970
You suspect there could be
a conspiracy in the Bureau?

14:13.053 --> 14:15.203
Do I hear a little 'tude, young man?

14:15.293 --> 14:18.524
No, no. But why would there be
a conspiracy in this case?

14:18.613 --> 14:20.729
Totally 'tudeless question.

14:20.813 --> 14:24.442
Prominent public figures
being murdered and eaten.

14:24.533 --> 14:27.127
Evidence secret societies
are being targeted -

14:27.213 --> 14:31.923
societies that have great influence
in the halls of power like the Bureau.

14:32.013 --> 14:35.005
You don't think that's a bit extreme?

14:35.093 --> 14:40.406
You went on <i>Larry King</i> to talk about the case,
and <i>TMZ,</i> because you know how big it is.

14:40.493 --> 14:42.961
And to get your piece of it.

14:43.053 --> 14:46.045
I'm a doctor.
I'm merely studying the case like you.

14:46.133 --> 14:47.646
Right.

14:48.293 --> 14:51.046
- Oh, man. I should've known.
- What?

14:51.133 --> 14:54.205
You expect me to tell you the answer,
Agent Madison?

14:54.293 --> 14:56.727
It's tricyclic acetone peroxide.

14:57.973 --> 14:59.486
That's not bad.

14:59.573 --> 15:04.966
It reacted with the molten thermal plastic
and... <i>...</i> boom.

15:05.053 --> 15:07.123
The containers must've been switched.

15:07.213 --> 15:10.125
Zack thought he was adding
a monomer he had made,

15:10.213 --> 15:13.649
but it was actually a volatile explosive.

15:14.733 --> 15:18.612
Yes, I'm busy. Cancel all my patients.
You don't have to tell them anything.

15:18.693 --> 15:20.046
- What are you doing?
- A word.

15:20.133 --> 15:21.361
- I'm talking.
- Hang up.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.205
I'll talk to you later.

15:23.293 --> 15:26.012
- Tight grip you got.
- It'll get tighter. Tell her.

15:26.093 --> 15:28.004
- Tell her what?
- Tell her now.

15:28.093 --> 15:32.291
Fine. I'll tell her. I sent my list to the Bureau.
They sent it to Sweets.

15:32.373 --> 15:35.604
You were the one who decided
not to tell Dr Brennan I was alive.

15:35.693 --> 15:38.890
He's the one you should've slugged.
So do it. Do it now.

15:38.973 --> 15:41.533
- You chose not to tell me?
- True. Technically.

15:41.613 --> 15:44.366
- Technically?!
- I reviewed the list and I decided,

15:44.453 --> 15:47.889
knowing Dr Brennan as I do,
that she was able to handle your death.

15:47.973 --> 15:49.804
- Slug him.
- It was national security!

15:49.893 --> 15:53.442
The fewer people that knew Agent Booth
was alive, the safer he would be!

15:53.533 --> 15:56.047
- I think that was a good choice.
- Awesome.

15:56.133 --> 15:58.010
- You do?
- Yes!

15:58.093 --> 16:01.449
You knew I could deal with it
because I can compartmentalise.

16:01.533 --> 16:05.492
- Wait. Why are you mad at me?
- Because you should've told me personally.

16:05.573 --> 16:10.522
Oh, I should've just ignored national security
concerns, broken the law, and told you?

16:10.613 --> 16:13.411
Yes. You know I'm very trustworthy.

16:13.493 --> 16:16.053
- But Sweets...
- He made a professional decision.

16:16.133 --> 16:19.170
He knew I could process your death
and move on. And I did.

16:19.253 --> 16:22.051
- There's gotta be other stuff going on.
- What?

16:22.133 --> 16:27.127
Transference. Paranoia. When I offer her
a piece of pie, you say it has deeper meaning.

16:27.213 --> 16:29.488
- I don't like pie.
- Apple pie.

16:29.573 --> 16:31.325
I don't like my fruit cooked.

16:31.413 --> 16:33.722
Changing the subject avoids your feelings.

16:33.813 --> 16:36.008
- Now you're attacking my feelings?
- Hey.

16:36.093 --> 16:40.371
- There's something in the Gormogon vault.
- Slug him.

16:40.453 --> 16:44.082
It's interesting psychologically
how Agent Booth's efforts

16:44.173 --> 16:48.485
to persuade you to enjoy fruit pie
could be interpreted as a kind of seduction.

16:48.573 --> 16:51.929
Whatever you two are talking about, stop it.
Zip it. Let's go.

16:58.053 --> 17:02.410
You think I don't recognise an experiment
when I see one? You experimented on us.

17:02.493 --> 17:04.483
- What?
- Not telling me Booth was alive.

17:04.573 --> 17:08.009
You wanted to quantify our reactions
for your own research.

17:08.093 --> 17:12.848
We agreed to let you observe us. We did not
agree to be used as lab rats. So cut it out!

17:12.933 --> 17:14.651
Why are you talking so fast?

17:14.733 --> 17:17.770
If Booth hears why you did what you did,
he'd beat you up.

17:17.853 --> 17:23.290
- Wouldn't that be an overly aggressive act?
- Not at all. So you'd better not do it again.

17:23.373 --> 17:26.604
-  Let's go, Bones. Where are you?
- On our way.

17:27.733 --> 17:33.729
Security had the entrance to this wing
locked. And the vault itself was secured.

17:34.933 --> 17:36.685
- The skeleton.
- Where'd it go?

17:36.773 --> 17:40.527
We don't know. I came to see if the screws
matched the skeleton and it was gone.

17:40.613 --> 17:43.491
But there are security cameras and sensors.

17:43.573 --> 17:46.007
- They all failed.
- All of them?

17:46.093 --> 17:49.768
When Zack's explosion set off the alarms,
every camera failed.

17:49.853 --> 17:53.448
- The loading dock was unlocked.
- Someone stole the skeleton.

17:53.533 --> 17:56.923
- Ten minutes before the explosion...
- Everything is working.

17:57.013 --> 18:01.404
Fast forward... Hodgins passes Zack
the container of tricyclic acetone peroxide.

18:01.493 --> 18:05.452
- I thought it was the monomer.
- The explosion was at 12:03 and 22 seconds.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.127
At 12:03 and 22 seconds...

18:09.133 --> 18:11.169
- Aren't there any backups?
- All dead.

18:11.253 --> 18:12.208
And the guards?

18:12.293 --> 18:15.763
A chemical accident takes precedence
over any other security issue.

18:15.853 --> 18:21.166
All personnel went to secure the lab or the
museum proper so there'd be no loss of life.

18:21.253 --> 18:24.609
During that time, the vault and skeleton
would be unsecured.

18:24.693 --> 18:30.165
Yes. Until the security system was
brought back up at 12:18 and 41 seconds.

18:31.693 --> 18:34.844
The explosion was a diversion
set up by Gormogon.

18:34.933 --> 18:41.088
He's here in the lab. It's an inside job.
Gormogon works in the Jeffersonian.

18:43.213 --> 18:47.570
- Either Gormogon or his new apprentice.
- That is a totally freaky thought.

18:47.653 --> 18:50.451
I need a full forensic team
sent to the Jeffersonian.

18:50.533 --> 18:53.252
Mobile labs, computers,
analysis, the works.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.042
No. Their equipment could be compromised.

18:59.813 --> 19:03.965
- Hair? Prints? Anything?
- Not since you asked five minutes ago.

19:04.053 --> 19:08.922
Dr Saroyan, please don't bother the techs.
You have a problem, you see me.

19:09.013 --> 19:13.848
I want to make sure you're doing your job.
After all, you're a prosecutor, not a forensic...

19:13.933 --> 19:16.686
You have been breathing down our necks
for two hours.

19:16.773 --> 19:20.891
Why don't you go get a latte or something?
You shouldn't be here anyway.

19:20.973 --> 19:25.967
- This is my department.
- I know. And you have full security clearance.

19:26.053 --> 19:30.285
- And complete access to the lab and vault.
- Are you saying I'm a suspect now?

19:30.373 --> 19:34.810
I'm saying someone's gonna put your name
on the list. You were a cop. Wouldn't you?

19:34.893 --> 19:38.886
You've got over 30 agents here.
Find something.

19:43.973 --> 19:49.001
- The lab has over 100 employees.
- And all their records are being looked at.

19:49.093 --> 19:53.291
- Don't you want pie? You always have pie.
- I'm fine. Stop talking about pie.

19:53.373 --> 19:58.208
- Is it because of what Sweets said?
- I'm just going pieless, OK?

19:58.293 --> 20:03.242
Can we talk for a minute? I have a profile
of someone I feel could be Gormogon.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.167
- No pie? You always eat pie.
- Enough with the pie. Just sit down.

20:07.253 --> 20:10.962
- You've been spying? More experiments?
- What experiments?

20:11.053 --> 20:15.843
I'm just being thorough. The dynamics of
our work environment affect how I treat you.

20:15.933 --> 20:19.687
- Can we just get on with it? Who is it?
- I believe it's Dr Hodgins.

20:21.973 --> 20:25.010
- What is Dr Hodgins?
- He thinks Hodgins is Gormogon.

20:25.093 --> 20:29.450
Hodgins exhibits paranoia
as well as a rationalised feeling of superiority.

20:29.533 --> 20:32.889
- Paranoia?
- He's consumed by conspiracy theories.

20:32.973 --> 20:37.603
From my observations, he's even suspect
of the FBI, with whom he works closely.

20:37.693 --> 20:39.684
It's all supposition.

20:39.773 --> 20:41.491
- No, no. Go on.
- Booth!

20:41.573 --> 20:46.772
Hodgins knew all about the secret societies.
He figured out the patterns Gormogon used.

20:46.853 --> 20:49.162
- He was doing his job.
- Or justifying himself.

20:49.253 --> 20:53.849
- He had access to the chemicals Zack used.
- He and Zack are friends.

20:53.933 --> 20:57.084
I also had access to the chemicals.
Why am I not a suspect?

20:57.173 --> 21:01.291
You have a reverence for life
that belies the cold calculations of a killer.

21:01.373 --> 21:07.130
- Your emotional connection with Booth...
- No. I don't have time for this. No.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.003
Don't you know by now you can't rush her?

21:10.093 --> 21:14.006
We're trying to catch a killer.
I thought it best not to waste time.

21:17.093 --> 21:18.811
<i>He's just trying to help.</i>

21:18.893 --> 21:22.169
His opinions won't get a conviction.
He has no evidence.

21:22.253 --> 21:25.290
- But he's a profiler with a great track record.
- Who?

21:25.373 --> 21:28.570
- Sweets.
- Sweets says that Hodgins is the killer.

21:28.653 --> 21:30.371
- That makes sense.
- What?

21:30.453 --> 21:32.409
- It throws suspicion off him.
- Who?

21:32.493 --> 21:35.690
- Sweets.
- You think Sweets is the killer?

21:35.773 --> 21:40.289
He shows up right after you find the vault
when Gormogon's at his most vulnerable.

21:40.373 --> 21:43.445
He plays you two like a cheap piano
until you ask for his help.

21:43.533 --> 21:45.728
Nobody plays me like a cheap piano.

21:45.813 --> 21:50.933
We all trusted the "brilliant young profiler".
I got him security clearance to help us.

21:51.013 --> 21:55.131
He was here. He had the opportunity
to switch Zack's chemicals.

21:55.213 --> 21:56.612
He's not a chemist.

21:56.693 --> 21:59.810
He's the only one we can't account for
after the explosion.

21:59.893 --> 22:02.248
We sound like Sweets.
We have no evidence.

22:02.333 --> 22:06.008
I was a cop for ten years, Dr Brennan.
I can smell it on him.

22:06.093 --> 22:08.448
We need more than your gut feeling.

22:08.533 --> 22:11.969
Well, then find it.
Cos trust me, Sweets is your boy.

22:26.973 --> 22:29.646
Dr Hodgins, knocking would be appreciated.

22:29.733 --> 22:32.452
Right. Sorry.

22:33.093 --> 22:36.403
So rumour is one of us is a suspect.
Who is it?

22:37.013 --> 22:40.210
- I can't say. You know that.
- Of course not.

22:40.293 --> 22:44.332
And since it's rumour,
it might not even be true. Right?

22:44.413 --> 22:48.804
Do you have a reason to see me? Or are you
just here to squeeze me for information?

22:48.893 --> 22:51.202
I found something.

22:53.693 --> 22:56.810
- Zack thought the mandible had been boiled.
- To remove tissue.

22:56.893 --> 23:01.808
I pulled trace elements from the mandible and
ran them to see what the bone was boiled in.

23:01.893 --> 23:05.568
It was tap water. But...
See this spike here?

23:05.653 --> 23:07.006
- Lead?
- Yes.

23:07.093 --> 23:11.325
- The city replaced all their lead pipes.
- But individual homeowners didn't.

23:11.413 --> 23:15.201
I focused on areas with the highest
lead levels. Older homes were the worst.

23:15.293 --> 23:20.606
This neighbourhood matches the level of lead
found on the victim's bone.

23:20.693 --> 23:23.571
Isn't that your house?

23:23.653 --> 23:26.292
Yes, it is.

23:27.133 --> 23:31.649
- But there are others that live in the area...
- Yeah, of course.

23:31.733 --> 23:36.170
- I'll pass this along to the investigators.
- Good.

23:38.133 --> 23:41.762
- Is there anything else?
- I could've fudged the facts,

23:41.853 --> 23:43.605
left my neighbourhood out.

23:43.693 --> 23:49.689
Yes, but that would've raised suspicion
if someone had double-checked your results.

23:50.773 --> 23:54.163
If you need me, I'll be at my station... helping.

24:07.493 --> 24:10.132
- Hey, this is a surprise.
- Yeah.

24:10.213 --> 24:12.807
Sweets, where were you
after the explosion?

24:12.893 --> 24:15.771
- I was with you.
- You were with us when it occurred.

24:15.853 --> 24:18.128
I mean after.

24:18.213 --> 24:21.205
Let's see. I ran to call 911.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.329
- Where?
- In your office. Why?

24:23.413 --> 24:24.641
Then what?

24:24.733 --> 24:28.851
- I went to show the EMTs where to go.
- You didn't come in with them.

24:28.933 --> 24:33.006
It's best to stay out of the way
of the professionals in those situations.

24:33.093 --> 24:36.165
- Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot one thing.
- What's that?

24:36.853 --> 24:42.803
I went down to the vault and I stole the silver
skeleton because I'm Gormogon's apprentice.

24:42.893 --> 24:45.930
That's a confession.
I can lock him up for 72 hours.

24:46.013 --> 24:48.686
- You'd lock me up for sarcasm?
- You should.

24:48.773 --> 24:51.241
You think I'm Gormogon's apprentice?

24:51.333 --> 24:56.202
Somebody is. I can check out your story and
not worry about you running off to Bolivia.

24:56.293 --> 24:58.488
- This is wretched.
- Better safe than sorry.

24:58.573 --> 25:00.803
- Yeah.
- No. You're projecting.

25:00.893 --> 25:06.490
You have a reasonable hostility to Gormogon.
But you have no outlet. So you're using me...

25:06.573 --> 25:09.451
Am I gonna have to break out my cuffs?

25:09.533 --> 25:14.561
Yeah. You are gonna need your cuffs.
Cos I'm not about to make this easy for you.

25:26.053 --> 25:27.645
Hi.

25:30.253 --> 25:31.845
How's Zack?

25:31.933 --> 25:37.053
Oh, he's in a lot of pain, but he won't let me
push the painkiller button.

25:37.133 --> 25:41.365
He's scared of polka dots,
but agony is just an interesting phenomenon.

25:41.453 --> 25:43.921
Drugs give me bad dreams.

25:44.013 --> 25:46.129
Hey there, Zack.

25:46.213 --> 25:50.286
I'm walking somewhere and suddenly
someone takes me by the hand,

25:50.373 --> 25:54.571
and I look and it's a skeleton,
and the skeleton's on fire.

25:54.653 --> 25:56.484
And my hands hurt.

25:56.573 --> 25:58.768
Take the painkillers, sweetie.

25:58.853 --> 26:01.413
I've been thinking about the explosion.

26:01.493 --> 26:06.009
No one could've switched the chemicals.
I locked up the container when I left the room.

26:06.093 --> 26:11.008
I had the only... key.

26:11.093 --> 26:13.732
You... would know, but...

26:13.813 --> 26:15.804
you...

26:16.933 --> 26:20.846
I'm afraid the painkillers,
while pleasant, dull my intellect.

26:20.933 --> 26:26.087
- Sometimes your friend's gotta step in.
-  Dumb it up for you.

26:34.653 --> 26:38.362
Don't you think it's time to go home?

26:38.453 --> 26:41.411
Sorry, Cam.
I seem to be a bit anxious.

26:41.493 --> 26:46.806
It's going around. Hodgins came to talk to me
and I almost jumped out of my skin.

26:46.893 --> 26:51.887
- What's keeping you so late?
- The tissue we used for the DNA test.

26:51.973 --> 26:57.730
The DNA alleles in the roots were destroyed.
And the marrow alleles were altered.

26:57.813 --> 27:02.250
Then I remembered the jawbone
seemed lighter in colour than I expected.

27:02.333 --> 27:05.086
- It was treated with ultraviolet light?
- I think so.

27:05.173 --> 27:07.164
- Who would do that?
- We would.

27:07.253 --> 27:10.848
Standard procedure for skeletal remains
when we store them.

27:10.933 --> 27:16.007
We have 10,000 sets of remains waiting
to be identified. What better hiding place?

27:16.093 --> 27:19.802
How do we sift through
10,000 sets of remains?

27:24.133 --> 27:27.569
I'd like to welcome
all of Dr Brennan's grad students to Limbo.

27:27.653 --> 27:30.929
It's Modular Skeletal Storage.
I don't like the moniker "Limbo".

27:31.013 --> 27:36.246
Over 10,000 lost souls remain here, sweetie.
Unidentified, waiting.

27:36.333 --> 27:38.608
It's a good name. Let's just go with it.

27:38.693 --> 27:42.208
Each of these boxes contains
the skeletal remains of one person.

27:42.293 --> 27:45.410
In this case, a skull, two femurs,
five vertebrae,

27:45.493 --> 27:47.927
miscellaneous phalanges, and three molars.

27:48.013 --> 27:50.243
We want you to conduct an inventory,

27:50.333 --> 27:55.327
making sure what's in the box corresponds to
the card in the box and the computer record.

27:55.413 --> 27:58.610
- Does this count toward our grade?
-  Listen.

27:58.693 --> 28:03.608
What we're trying to do here is catch
a serial killer, not get a gold star from Teach.

28:03.693 --> 28:07.652
We think that he's hidden the remains
of one or more of his victims here.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.611
Bones tucked into boxes
where they don't belong.

28:10.693 --> 28:14.811
It's fair to say that if you help catch
a serial killer, you'll pass your course.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.531
That's not necessarily true.

28:16.613 --> 28:20.686
If anyone else shows up down here
indicating an interest in what you're doing,

28:20.773 --> 28:23.970
- tell Ms Montenegro or shout for Security.
- Why?

28:24.053 --> 28:29.173
Because serial killers get mean
when you get close to catching 'em.

28:35.613 --> 28:40.084
- This is just creepy.
- It's the natural order. We all end up this way.

28:40.173 --> 28:43.449
Thank you, <i>chÃ©rie.</i>
Now you've made it creepy and depressing.

28:43.533 --> 28:46.889
I found an extra femur in one box
and an extra fibula in another.

28:46.973 --> 28:50.010
- Are you sure?
- The remains were of a four-year-old child.

28:50.093 --> 28:52.243
The femur was from
a man in his late forties.

28:52.333 --> 28:54.483
- And the fibula?
- Also from a middle-aged man.

28:54.573 --> 28:57.963
It had recently been boiled.
Three other people found extra bones.

28:58.053 --> 29:03.127
I found a manubrium, a male
ulna and a humerus amongst female remains.

29:03.213 --> 29:09.129
- OK. Lay out all the extra bones anatomically.
- It's already done. Over here.

29:12.293 --> 29:15.490
- Nice job.
- I'm third in my class.

29:15.573 --> 29:19.248
I would like the names
of the two students in front of you.

29:19.333 --> 29:21.483
45 to 50 years old.

29:21.573 --> 29:26.408
Fibula and femur show a height
of approximately 180cms.

29:26.493 --> 29:29.644
- How tall is that in English?
- Approximately 5'8".

29:29.733 --> 29:34.488
Have Dr Saroyan compare DNA samples
to all of Gormogon's known victims.

29:34.573 --> 29:38.327
- You suspect something.
- I have no facts. My opinions are not relevant.

29:38.413 --> 29:41.928
Let me make the call.
Give me some of that big brain of yours.

29:42.013 --> 29:45.369
- Someone removed the mandible.
- It's the one that was sent to you.

29:45.453 --> 29:49.162
I can't say that with certainty.
Dr Saroyan should see if the DNA matches.

29:49.253 --> 29:52.848
Didn't you hear her?
Get this up to Dr Saroyan. Now.

29:53.533 --> 29:57.526
Dr Brennan?
I think you should take a look at this.

30:02.453 --> 30:06.731
All the canines have been removed
from these skulls. Just the canines.

30:06.813 --> 30:09.850
I want the security tapes from this room
for the last six months.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.730
- This room isn't covered.
- Why not?

30:11.813 --> 30:17.524
It's Limbo. I need to re-examine the mandible
Zack was working on before the explosion.

30:17.613 --> 30:19.808
Of course you do.

30:22.213 --> 30:25.728
It's the lobbyist that disappeared.

30:25.813 --> 30:29.169
DNA's a match, and so are the dentals.

30:29.253 --> 30:31.813
Dr Brennan will want to
see the markings on these.

30:31.893 --> 30:34.407
What's that?
More teeth marks on the bone?

30:34.493 --> 30:39.203
Gormogon went after this
like Henry VIII after a chicken leg.

30:41.293 --> 30:45.605
These appear to have been gnawed on. They'll
probably match the markings Zack found.

30:45.693 --> 30:48.491
- They won't.
- You haven't looked at them yet.

30:48.573 --> 30:50.803
Zack said these markings on the mandible

30:50.893 --> 30:54.886
were made by artificial dentures
made from polymethyl methacrylate.

30:54.973 --> 30:58.807
- And?
- They were not made by artificial dentures.

30:58.893 --> 31:02.010
- Zack should've known that.
- He made a mistake. It happens.

31:02.093 --> 31:04.084
Not often.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.001
I heard Zack was wrong about the dentures.

31:11.093 --> 31:12.765
- No.
- Cam and Caroline said...

31:12.853 --> 31:15.765
He knew they weren't artificial.

31:15.853 --> 31:19.209
The dentures were made from real teeth.
All canines.

31:19.293 --> 31:20.612
Oh, whoa.

31:20.693 --> 31:25.209
Canines are a symbol of the wolf, which are
on the Gormogon tapestry in the vault.

31:25.293 --> 31:28.808
Certain ancient sects revered the wolf
as a symbol of freedom,

31:28.893 --> 31:32.681
as a representative of the forces
that will deliver us from persecution.

31:32.773 --> 31:36.163
Enough about the wolf. What's going on?

31:36.253 --> 31:38.209
- Zack lied.
- Why?

31:40.053 --> 31:43.966
He took the teeth from bone storage

31:44.053 --> 31:47.409
and he made Gormogon's dentures.

31:48.693 --> 31:51.161
Zack has complete access to the lab.

31:51.253 --> 31:53.926
He arranged the explosion himself.

31:54.013 --> 31:57.562
It's Zack. He's the killer, Booth.

31:58.493 --> 32:00.563
It's Zack.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.362
"The theory of conditional expressions

32:04.453 --> 32:08.366
is a nonprofound generalisation
of propositional calculus."

32:08.453 --> 32:11.331
What does it say after "Boolean forms?"

32:11.413 --> 32:14.644
There's a little thing
that looks like a Japanese stool,

32:14.733 --> 32:19.170
then a B with a tail, then a fat fish.
Does this make sense to you?

32:19.253 --> 32:21.767
It doesn't to you?

32:21.853 --> 32:25.163
Cam. We need the room.

32:38.093 --> 32:42.405
I'm sorry, but I have to ask.
Are you absolutely certain? Because...

32:43.853 --> 32:46.572
Well, I did not see that coming.

32:50.293 --> 32:53.603
- You looked at the mandible.
- You had to know I'd see it.

32:53.693 --> 32:56.412
I didn't foresee the extent of my injuries.

32:56.493 --> 32:59.769
- I was going to sneak out, but...
- Your friends never left you.

32:59.853 --> 33:03.766
And you intended to steal the jawbone
and add it to the silver skeleton.

33:03.853 --> 33:07.892
But you designed the explosion.
You must've known how big it would be.

33:07.973 --> 33:11.045
Hodgins argued with me. He stood too close.

33:11.133 --> 33:14.091
The delay allowed the thermoplastic to boil

33:14.173 --> 33:17.722
and the explosion was three times
more powerful than I calculated.

33:17.813 --> 33:21.010
- You must've known you'd be badly injured.
- Yes.

33:25.773 --> 33:28.128
- Who's Gormogon?
- That's not what he's called.

33:28.213 --> 33:29.965
Then what is he called?

33:30.053 --> 33:32.487
- The master.
- And you're his apprentice?

33:32.573 --> 33:34.450
- I need a name.
- I can't tell you.

33:34.533 --> 33:37.889
The apprentice is expendable.
I'm expendable.

33:37.973 --> 33:41.170
- Who is he?
- Zack responds to logic...

33:41.253 --> 33:44.370
I'd love to hear the logic
of killing and eating people.

33:44.453 --> 33:47.172
- The master's logic is irrefutable.
- Irrefutable?

33:47.253 --> 33:49.813
I saw him choking a child
at the bottom of a pool!

33:49.893 --> 33:54.569
If you knew what I know, you'd understand.
You'd be proud of me.

33:55.773 --> 33:58.207
I've always been proud of you, Zack.

33:58.293 --> 34:03.651
I've never met anyone more rational
or intelligent. But there's a fault in your logic.

34:03.733 --> 34:07.726
With all due respect,
you aren't cognisant of his logic.

34:07.813 --> 34:10.725
Assumption No.1:
secret societies exist.

34:10.813 --> 34:13.804
Accepted. Hodgins has been
explaining this to me for years.

34:13.893 --> 34:18.808
Assumption No.2: the human experience
is adversely affected by secret societies.

34:18.893 --> 34:21.327
- Accepted.
- Assumption No.3:

34:21.413 --> 34:26.646
attacking and killing members of secret
societies will improve the human experience.

34:26.733 --> 34:27.722
Accepted.

34:27.813 --> 34:32.443
All of your assumptions
are built upon a first principle, Zack.

34:32.533 --> 34:36.650
To wit, the historical
human experience as a whole

34:36.733 --> 34:39.565
is more important than a single person's life.

34:39.652 --> 34:41.371
Yes.

34:43.132 --> 34:47.012
Yet you risked it all
so you wouldn't hurt Hodgins.

35:03.453 --> 35:05.205
There's...

35:05.293 --> 35:10.242
You're correct.
There's an inconsistency in my reasoning.

35:10.333 --> 35:12.051
Bones, I need a name.

35:12.133 --> 35:14.124
We know.

35:15.253 --> 35:20.168
He first approached me three months ago at
a symposium on burning plasma diagnostics.

35:20.253 --> 35:25.373
Zack, I need to know who this guy is.
I need to go get him now.

35:25.453 --> 35:28.763
I don't know his name.
I've never known his name.

35:28.853 --> 35:33.802
But I've been to his house.
I was blindfolded when he first took me there.

35:34.373 --> 35:38.685
<i>But I remember every turn he took</i>
<i>and I was able to estimate his speed.</i>

35:38.773 --> 35:42.209
<i>So when he brought me home,</i>
<i>I found it on a map.</i>

35:43.013 --> 35:47.245
It's in Benning Ridge.
On a street called Savoy Crescent.

35:47.333 --> 35:52.805
<i>It's a big place. Almost as big as</i>
<i>Hodgins' house. But run-down.</i>

35:52.893 --> 35:56.886
<i>There's a flight of stairs at the back, outside.</i>

35:56.973 --> 35:59.965
<i>There's a blue door.</i>

36:00.053 --> 36:06.447
<i>It'll be locked, but there's a key in the crevice</i>
<i>to the left of the door just above eye level.</i>

36:08.453 --> 36:10.489
<i>You will see a hallway.</i>

36:10.573 --> 36:14.168
<i>If he's found someone,</i>
<i>you will smell meat cooking.</i>

36:14.253 --> 36:17.882
<i>And that's how you'll know</i>
<i>you're getting close.</i>

36:17.973 --> 36:20.771
<i>One last door.</i>
<i>And you'll have to be fast.</i>

36:20.853 --> 36:24.163
<i>He'll be at the bottom of an incline</i>
<i>in the floor.</i>

36:29.613 --> 36:31.604
<i>He'll have a knife.</i>

36:31.693 --> 36:34.765
<i>He's very fast. And he's very strong.</i>

37:18.893 --> 37:20.485
- Did you get him?
- Got him.

37:20.573 --> 37:22.928
- Who was he, Booth?
- Nobody.

37:23.013 --> 37:28.041
Am I right? He was nobody. An invisible man
angry at history for not seeing him.

37:28.133 --> 37:31.364
For a nobody, he sure wrecked a lot of lives.

37:37.893 --> 37:40.930
Zack confessed
to stabbing the lobbyist in the heart.

37:41.013 --> 37:42.924
- He never ate anybody?
- No.

37:43.013 --> 37:45.004
- So how did this happen?
- Logic.

37:45.093 --> 37:48.722
No. I'm sorry, <i>chÃ©rie.</i>
That might cut it with you eggheads.

37:48.813 --> 37:51.202
This happened
the way this always happens.

37:51.293 --> 37:55.002
A strong personality finds a weak personality
and takes advantage.

37:55.093 --> 37:59.450
- I hope we fry the guy.
- That's not gonna be necessary.

37:59.893 --> 38:02.327
Good riddance, I say.

38:02.413 --> 38:05.132
- What'll happen to Zack?
- I cut a deal.

38:05.213 --> 38:09.252
He pleads guilty, cooperates,
and we find him <i>non compos mentis.</i>

38:09.333 --> 38:13.485
Zack is moved to a secure psychiatric facility
instead of going to prison.

38:13.573 --> 38:17.202
No. That won't stand up.
Zack isn't actually insane.

38:17.293 --> 38:21.764
Sweets, you're gonna give this one to Bones.
You understand?

38:21.853 --> 38:24.048
- I understand.
- Good.

38:47.653 --> 38:52.647
I probably could've spent more time with
Zack. Got him to see the world a bit more.

38:52.733 --> 38:58.012
Those things I say about secret societies and
conspiracies, I never knew he was listening.

38:58.093 --> 39:01.244
- I should've gotten him a girlfriend.
- The hell with Zack.

39:01.333 --> 39:04.166
He's an adult. He made his choices.
People are who they are.

39:04.253 --> 39:06.608
There's nothing we could've done for him.

39:06.693 --> 39:08.968
- We love Zack.
- Yeah? He killed someone.

39:09.053 --> 39:11.772
He deserves to be locked up
for the rest of his life.

39:11.853 --> 39:16.688
I feel I must point out that what Dr Saroyan
just said is her way of handling grief.

39:16.773 --> 39:20.766
She doesn't mean it.
Quite the opposite, in fact.

39:20.853 --> 39:24.687
I knew the day I met Zack he'd cause me pain.

39:32.253 --> 39:34.721
So what do you got there, Hodgins?

39:34.813 --> 39:39.170
- This is, uh, Zack's favourite stuff.
- What are we gonna do with it?

39:39.253 --> 39:42.051
Where he's going,
they might actually let him have it.

39:42.133 --> 39:44.693
Oh! I got him that.

39:44.773 --> 39:48.732
Yeah. Thanks.
He waved that in my face every day.

39:50.053 --> 39:54.569
<i>Pocket Kama Sutra.</i> I gave him this
so he'd stop asking Booth sex questions.

39:57.133 --> 40:00.045
I got Zack this before he went to Iraq.

40:00.853 --> 40:02.002
Hey.

40:02.453 --> 40:04.489
I drew this for him.

40:06.213 --> 40:10.570
It's interesting that all of his favourite things
are objects you gave to him.

40:10.653 --> 40:13.963
- I never gave him anything.
-  He totally loved you.

40:14.053 --> 40:16.965
I mean, as much as he was capable.

40:17.053 --> 40:19.408
But I never gave him anything.

40:20.893 --> 40:22.804
Angela.

40:45.973 --> 40:48.612
"Dear Mr Addy,
it is my pleasure to offer you

40:48.693 --> 40:52.322
the post of my intern
in forensic anthropology."

40:52.413 --> 40:55.803
"I chose you from hundreds of applicants
because of your knowledge,

40:55.893 --> 41:01.365
your desire to learn, and because
I feel you will find a home here."

41:05.093 --> 41:08.483
I think you gave him something great, Bones.

41:49.373 --> 41:50.692
What's that mean?

41:51.453 --> 41:53.444
