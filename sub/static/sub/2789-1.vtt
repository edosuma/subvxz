05:03.972 --> 05:08.434
Thanks, Toni, having only known him since
freshman year.

05:08.434 --> 05:14.607
Still kind of cool, though, right? Finding
out you actually had some family out there.

05:14.607 --> 05:18.194
We are his family.
That's why we're all here.

are right behind us.

I don't know these people or this place.

05:27.495 --> 05:32.625

- Yeah.

And your old camera posted my naked ass
all over the internet last trip!

07:30.582 --> 07:35.498
And got 4,000 hits in one day.
Besides, come on, it's fun.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.126

that I belonged to something.

are finally here.

Baked.

out today and then we will have the place...

...all to ourselves.
Oh, goody.

11:10.046 --> 11:13.816

- And Amish.

Just let it roll off my back nowadays.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.067

while we figure out how best to deal with you.

Ain't no doubt all of this
is a little bit weird.

You guys don't get the charm of this place?

13:04.994 --> 13:07.163
I do.

13:07.163 --> 13:10.082
You rip the place down, subdivide the land,

13:10.082 --> 13:12.251
and we go back, we will send someone in
for a real appraisal.

13:13.294 --> 13:16.255
Yeah, I think you're forgetting
that I don't have anywhere to go.

13:16.255 --> 13:19.550
(SCOFFS) What, so this is your home now?

13:19.550 --> 13:21.260

13:23.554 --> 13:28.601
and Nobu on Friday nights.
Yeah. And look what that did to me.

a decision right away. It's fine.

It has history, secrets.

at least.

- Uh, sure.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.657

13:43.657 --> 13:48.996

or a Hollywood scandal, who'd give a shit?

about my history. So me. Yeah, me too.

No, we're staying up at Hobb Springs.

22:32.352 --> 22:33.895
You don't say.

22:35.313 --> 22:39.609
I don't get up there much myself anymore,
but I expect I will be.

22:39.609 --> 22:42.070
- Well, why is that?
- You just got in?

22:42.070 --> 22:43.321
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22:43.321 --> 22:46.324
You all see a bunch of little, old
ladies be-bopping around up there?

22:46.324 --> 22:48.410
Oh, yeah.
The Daughters of the Revolution?

22:48.410 --> 22:53.206
That'd be them. Poor things can't remember
if this woman got back on that bus or not.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.750
Agnes Fields, you hear of her?

22:54.750 --> 22:58.045
No. Like I said, we just got here, so...

22:58.045 --> 23:02.090
Just what is a lovely couple like you
doing settling in Hobb Springs?

23:02.090 --> 23:07.012
Oh, well, our friend inherited it.
Well, nice for him, huh?

23:07.012 --> 23:08.263
Tell you what.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.974
You take one of these up there,
do me a favor, show it around.

23:10.974 --> 23:14.019
Maybe we get lucky and her face
will ring a bell with somebody.

23:14.019 --> 23:16.396
Oh, is there a reward?

23:17.639 --> 23:19.733
Sure thing, officer.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.943
I can't think what could
have happened to her.

23:23.570 --> 23:26.740
- OK. Well, take care.
- See you.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.999
What are you doing?

23:37.584 --> 23:39.586
I can't get this hot spot to work.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.173
Have you guys seen Danny?

23:43.173 --> 23:45.217
Yeah, he just wandered
through here a minute ago.

23:45.217 --> 23:47.427
Leave him alone, Mom, he's enjoying himself.

23:47.427 --> 23:53.892

Let's go find him. Thank you.

just gives me the creeps.

24:06.947 --> 24:10.283
TONI: Danny. We have been looking
all over for you.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.869
You OK?

Take a look at this picture

Even some of the women do.

How could I not know any of these people?
These pictures only go up to the '70s.

Maybe your side of the family moved.

I don't know how to break this
to you, man,

24:52.784 --> 24:57.664
but what we have here
is classic mountain breeding.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.833
- DANNY: Stop.
- I am just saying, there's bound...

24:59.833 --> 25:02.110
...to be a few defects along the way.

25:02.110 --> 25:04.671
- DANNY: Stop. Seriously.
- You heard him!

25:05.547 --> 25:09.843
You think because we're mountain folk,
our ways ain't fit for fine society?

25:09.843 --> 25:12.679
We have had all sorts stay here,
including three presidents:

25:12.679 --> 25:14.848
Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolidge,
and Jefferson Davis.

25:14.848 --> 25:17.058
Not one had a complaint!

25:17.058 --> 25:20.061
- Jefferson Davis?
- It's OK, Jackson. Really.

25:20.061 --> 25:23.940
He was just messing around.
Weren't you, Vic?

25:23.940 --> 25:28.987
I am sorry.
I am just very proud of my heritage.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.990
Families really tamed this land,
they made it into something.

25:31.990 --> 25:34.242
It's impressive. Really.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.492
Yeah.

Want to see something really impressive?
Yeah. Come on.

- Shit!
- Don't touch. Sorry.

26:11.271 --> 26:13.531
You have a good eye, Danny.
It belonged to your grandfather.

26:13.531 --> 26:17.577
- He was hell with a bow.
- The bane of critters everywhere.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.675
- What is it, honey?
- My grandfather.

26:24.376 --> 26:30.298
My grandfather.
I just can't believe I even had a grand...

26:30.298 --> 26:32.968
Please. Give it a feel.

26:44.471 --> 26:46.022
Man, that's tight.

26:46.022 --> 26:48.566
Ever been bow hunting, Danny?

26:48.566 --> 26:50.402
Never been hunting, period.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.196
I would like to keep it that way.

26:53.196 --> 26:57.041
That's hardly a proper view, miss,
considering you haven't even tried it once.

26:59.911 --> 27:00.954
Don't.

27:07.585 --> 27:10.755
- Fit OK?
- I am getting used to it.

27:10.755 --> 27:12.340
I knew you would.

27:12.340 --> 27:16.011
Your girl, she really
didn't want you to come.

27:16.011 --> 27:19.222
She's just being protective.
They all are.

and girl to match.

27:21.599 --> 27:26.813
Bryan? We used to work together,
before it all... happened.

27:28.857 --> 27:32.152
I used to be on Wall Street.
Had a bit of a meltdown.

27:32.152 --> 27:36.156
- Seems an appropriate reaction.
- (SCOFFS) Not everybody thought so.

27:36.156 --> 27:39.159
Not my company.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.578
Definitely not my clients.

27:42.495 --> 27:43.955
I lost a lot of people's money.

27:43.955 --> 27:48.793
Including Bryan's, Toni's, my own.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.754
I guess that's when you find out
who your real friends are.

27:50.754 --> 27:55.050
- The ones who stand by you.
- Maybe they think you owe them.

27:55.050 --> 27:59.763
No, not them.
It was all so embarrassing.

27:59.763 --> 28:05.101
You weren't suited to that nonsense.
On the plus side, it's how we found you.

28:05.101 --> 28:10.273
What do you mean?
JACKSON: We do have the internet out here.

28:10.273 --> 28:12.567
- DANNY: So you found me through Google?
- JACKSON: Yeah.

28:12.567 --> 28:16.446
Took a long time.
But it was important we found you.

28:16.446 --> 28:20.241
- To run a hotel?
- Amongst other things.

28:34.672 --> 28:38.802

This doesn't belong to somebody?

28:38.802 --> 28:41.429

like him alone with these people. OK, Mom.

41:33.784 --> 41:37.913
Can I interest you in an herbal essence?
Keep that shit away from me too.

41:37.913 --> 41:40.583
You see one mountain monster man,
and you go cold turkey.

41:40.583 --> 41:42.626
- I saw...
- What?

41:44.879 --> 41:47.047
Nothing. Give that to me.

41:49.675 --> 41:51.760
- You. Dude!
- Oh, shoot!

41:51.760 --> 41:53.095
(LAUGHING)

41:53.095 --> 41:57.474
You know what I saw today?
Civil War era.

41:57.474 --> 41:59.894
Flatware. Silver.

42:01.312 --> 42:03.063
What are you doing? (LAUGHS)

42:05.941 --> 42:08.944
Oh, you know.
Just feeling some love tonight.

42:11.572 --> 42:15.367
Now. Go, go, chug!
There we go, there we go.

42:15.367 --> 42:19.330
- There it is! Yeah!
- (LAUGHING)

42:26.337 --> 42:27.463
Give that.

42:29.924 --> 42:32.635
- Hey, man.
- Ah!

42:34.178 --> 42:37.932
- Nice.
- You see any mountain men now? Ahh!

42:41.936 --> 42:42.686
No.

42:44.271 --> 42:45.814
Better.

42:52.780 --> 42:55.950
(KISSING SOUNDS)

42:59.203 --> 43:01.330
- Wait.
- What is it?

43:04.375 --> 43:06.627
(SCREAMING)

43:10.339 --> 43:12.049
- Now I feel better.
- Damn it!

43:12.049 --> 43:14.802
Come on, Jill!
Give us the old Girls Gone Wild.

43:14.802 --> 43:18.472
Fuck you! I'd like to see you guys
do Boys Gone Wild.

43:18.472 --> 43:20.766
What do you mean?

43:22.268 --> 43:24.895
- Now it's a party!
- Get that away!

43:24.895 --> 43:27.147
Sick. You're sick.

43:28.357 --> 43:30.359
- Come on, guys.
- Sorry.

43:35.072 --> 43:37.741
- Yeah!
- Nice!

43:37.741 --> 43:40.160
Just a minute, guys.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.371
ALL: Whoa!

43:51.088 --> 43:53.882
- You OK, man?
- (GASPING)

45:12.586 --> 45:14.004
(TOILET FLUSHES)

45:33.273 --> 45:35.484
Wait a second. You're doing what?

45:35.484 --> 45:38.404
Restoring Hobb Springs.
Top to bottom.

45:38.404 --> 45:40.906
Figure we could have a grand reopening
by next summer.

45:40.906 --> 45:43.450
What did you do to him last night?

45:43.450 --> 45:46.120
- This isn't me.
- It was my decision.

45:46.120 --> 45:48.414
There's something about this place.

45:48.414 --> 45:51.166
Haven't you guys felt different
since you got here?

45:51.166 --> 45:55.212
- Yeah. I have been freaking out.
- Passing out over here.

45:55.212 --> 45:59.258
- Toni?
- No, we're really happy for you, hon.

45:59.258 --> 46:02.761
- But this place...
- Was great. And it can be again.

46:02.761 --> 46:07.349
Do you even know anything about...
about running a hotel, or a spa?

46:07.349 --> 46:11.854
- I am not just doing it for the money.
- No, we get that. We really do.

46:11.854 --> 46:15.441
Rod? You said that we'd all
make a great web series.

46:15.441 --> 46:19.278
What better way to film a group
of friends restoring a great landmark.

46:19.278 --> 46:22.906
Yeah. I could definitely cut
a good sizzle reel together.

46:22.906 --> 46:26.535
- Make it a rustic Real World.
- DANNY: And Vic?

46:26.535 --> 46:28.996
You said you were game for writing a
book about the history of this place.

46:28.996 --> 46:32.833
- Sure, but...
- See, Bry? We build awareness.

46:32.833 --> 46:37.838
The rest of it is just simple business sense
and that's why they paid us the big bucks.

46:37.838 --> 46:39.381
What do you say, man?

46:41.758 --> 46:44.720
Well, I guess it wouldn't hurt
to draw up a business plan.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.513
I knew you'd come around.

46:49.933 --> 46:52.978
I know what you're going to say.
Then why are you going to make me say it?

46:52.978 --> 46:56.023
Did you look at the guy?
It's like night and day.

46:56.023 --> 46:58.484
We were supposed to be going
back to the city.

46:58.484 --> 47:01.778
It's not so easy for me
to just pack it all in, you know.

47:01.778 --> 47:02.988
We came here to help him.

47:02.988 --> 47:05.324
I don't even know why
we're still friends with the guy!

47:05.324 --> 47:08.452
Oh, my God!
You just don't know when to shut up!

47:11.246 --> 47:12.998
What?

47:13.832 --> 47:16.168
What exactly were you doing with that?

47:16.168 --> 47:17.711
Jillian?

47:20.422 --> 47:22.132
This is Staffordshire.

47:22.132 --> 47:24.259
Do you have any idea
how much these are worth?

47:24.259 --> 47:25.844
How much?

47:27.763 --> 47:30.474
Two thousand, at least.

47:31.683 --> 47:35.062
Cabinet's full of them. I...

47:35.062 --> 47:38.440
I didn't think anyone would notice.

47:38.440 --> 47:39.900
Show me.

47:43.111 --> 47:48.450
Where else have you checked for these?
Just here. I didn't want to look alone.

47:48.450 --> 47:52.412
All right. I will bring them to you,
and you catalogue them. OK?

47:53.830 --> 47:55.374
Yes!

48:01.672 --> 48:02.673
Hey.

48:05.133 --> 48:07.094
Oh, yeah.

48:09.096 --> 48:13.600
These... are perfect.

48:45.215 --> 48:48.010
So secret passages really do exist.

48:51.346 --> 48:54.474
JILLIAN: Yeah, but where do they lead?

49:08.363 --> 49:10.073
Check out those cupboards.

49:17.122 --> 49:18.874
Are we going down there?

49:18.874 --> 49:21.835
They keep priceless antiques
out in the open.

49:21.835 --> 49:24.588
Can you imagine what they
decided to hide?

50:01.917 --> 50:05.212
- JILLIAN: Hey. Are they...?
- BRYAN: Yep.

50:05.212 --> 50:07.464
They're screwing.

50:14.096 --> 50:15.764
What the hell is that?

50:17.307 --> 50:19.309
I think I know.

50:24.815 --> 50:26.274
Get the idea?

50:26.274 --> 50:28.443
Wait.

50:28.443 --> 50:34.491
You're saying that they would just have sex
here while people stood by and watched? Mm-hm.

50:35.575 --> 50:39.287
Geez. This is one kinky spa.

50:42.040 --> 50:43.583
Whoa, whoa!

50:43.583 --> 50:47.295
- What are you doing?
- Well, I am agreeing with you.

50:47.295 --> 50:49.631
Kinky, right?

50:56.522 --> 50:59.766
Wait. Are we really going to do this?

51:01.810 --> 51:03.770
Yeah.

51:23.081 --> 51:27.002
(MOANING, PANTING)

51:55.238 --> 51:58.867
(MOANING, PANTING CONTINUE)

52:38.365 --> 52:41.618
- (CACKLING)
- (SCREAMING)

52:43.662 --> 52:44.412
No!

(CACKLING)

53:13.608 --> 53:15.694
SALLY: Stop!

53:17.320 --> 53:19.823
You were supposed to wait!

53:20.699 --> 53:23.535
Now you disrespect this room?

53:25.537 --> 53:27.789
Well, go on now!

53:27.789 --> 53:31.084
You might as well take what you came for.

53:32.377 --> 53:34.462
He stays with me.

53:37.549 --> 53:40.349
SALLY: Get.....
(GROWLS)

54:05.327 --> 54:08.455
(BRYAN GROANING SOFTLY)

54:10.707 --> 54:13.793
What those boys did to you...

54:28.308 --> 54:30.685
- You like that?
- (GRUNTS)

54:30.685 --> 54:32.562
Your head's hurt real bad.

54:32.562 --> 54:35.690
But I have seen people live
with a lot worse.

54:39.186 --> 54:42.030
Just let Sally take care of you.

54:46.660 --> 54:49.079
You're so handsome.

54:50.622 --> 54:55.001
I think you like me rubbing up against you.
BRYAN: No...

54:56.294 --> 54:58.421
No...

55:11.184 --> 55:14.688
I can make you feel better
than that stuck-up bitch you brought.

55:14.688 --> 55:18.900
- (BRYAN GROANS, COUGHS)
- (SALLY MOANING)

55:20.860 --> 55:22.237
JACKSON: Sally!

55:24.447 --> 55:27.450
You're supposed to be saving yourself
for when the time's right.

55:27.450 --> 55:29.369
When's that going to be?

55:29.369 --> 55:31.162
I know it's hard to wait.

55:34.290 --> 55:40.005
But I am so close, that I can touch him.
How did this one get in here to begin with?

55:42.257 --> 55:44.300
I tried to stop them.

55:45.427 --> 55:47.887
The fact they stopped at all
is a small miracle.

55:47.887 --> 55:54.019
They're just not listening. Tonight then.
We have them all meet Danny tonight.

55:55.520 --> 55:57.272
You ready?

56:00.734 --> 56:02.819
Finish him off.

56:03.194 --> 56:05.030
Take him to the kitchen.

56:05.030 --> 56:06.906
We will carve him up later.

56:12.912 --> 56:14.873
SALLY: Don't you fret, lover.

56:14.873 --> 56:17.751
You will be in me, one way or another.

56:22.088 --> 56:23.288
(GROANING)

56:30.722 --> 56:33.808
(SALLY MOANING)

56:48.239 --> 56:50.450
VIC: Water damage.

56:50.450 --> 56:52.660
Fried outlets.

56:52.660 --> 56:54.454
Mold.

56:54.454 --> 56:56.664
I am going to need some more paper.

56:56.664 --> 57:00.126
This would go a hell of a lot faster
if we knew what Danny had in mind.

57:00.126 --> 57:04.714
Where is Danny?
We need keys to some of these places.

57:04.714 --> 57:09.010
Check the front desk.
Only if Wednesday Adams is on a break.

57:09.010 --> 57:11.721
- Vic.
- Fine.

57:11.721 --> 57:16.017
I will go, but you go get your boyfriend.
This was all his idea.

57:41.417 --> 57:43.253
TONI: Danny?

57:50.051 --> 57:51.845
Danny?

57:54.013 --> 57:56.399
- Toni! Hey.
- (GASPS)

57:56.399 --> 57:57.559
(LAUGHS)

57:59.811 --> 58:03.523
We could all use a little guidance
out there, please. OK.

58:04.274 --> 58:07.318
- Did you do all this?
- No.

58:09.070 --> 58:11.322
- TONI: This is Jillian's.
- DANNY: Yeah.

58:11.322 --> 58:15.994
Was she trying to take these?
I don't know.

58:15.994 --> 58:18.955
She and Bry were always going on
about selling things off.

58:18.955 --> 58:20.790
TONI: Without asking you?

58:20.790 --> 58:26.880
When it comes to money, Bryan's done worse.
Have you seen them anywhere? No.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.634
DANNY: Looks like they took off
with a few parting gifts.

58:31.634 --> 58:33.219
That's not like them, though.

58:33.219 --> 58:35.388
Well, I guess you never
really know anybody, huh?

58:35.388 --> 58:37.515
We have known them for three years.

58:37.515 --> 58:41.144
Yeah, all they have ever been about
is the quick and easy.

58:41.144 --> 58:45.648
Bryan with his subprimes, and Jillian
playing the Manhattan socialite bitch.

58:45.648 --> 58:48.234
- Danny!
- She's from Wisconsin.

58:48.234 --> 58:51.237
I mean, I gave them a chance
to get in on the ground floor.

58:51.237 --> 58:55.617
God forbid they ever achieve anything
in life by actually working for it.

58:55.617 --> 58:58.077
- That's what I am trying to do here.
- Wow, Danny.

58:58.077 --> 59:02.365
They are your friends. You know why Bryan's
so eager to get me back in the firm?

59:02.365 --> 59:04.334
So he didn't have to do any work.

59:04.334 --> 59:07.754
I always did the heavy lifting,
and look what that cost me.

59:07.754 --> 59:10.840
They're my old life.
This... this is my new one.

59:10.840 --> 59:14.177
My God! I am really trying hard
to be supportive right now,

59:14.177 --> 59:16.888
but the only person I don't
feel like I know is you!

59:16.888 --> 59:19.224
- What are you talking about?
- It is this place!

59:19.224 --> 59:22.101
- You wanted to bring me here. Yeah.
- Because I thought it was going to help.

59:22.101 --> 59:27.440
And it has! Even Sally noticed the difference
from when I got here. Oh, my God. Sally?

59:27.440 --> 59:30.126
Oh, don't start... don't start that again. Please.
You want to bring up... No, no! No!

59:30.126 --> 59:36.074
Her and her brother/husband/cousin/whatever.
Enough of that shit! They are the only ones...

59:36.074 --> 59:39.619
...that we really know nothing about!
How do you not get that?

59:39.619 --> 59:42.337
You want to know something?
Go ask them yourself.

59:42.337 --> 59:46.209
Yeah, have you? Have you checked into
anything that they have told you?

59:46.209 --> 59:48.962
- They have been nothing but kind to me.
- And we haven't?

59:48.962 --> 59:55.176
You don't understand. Oh, my...
These people are my... What? What are they?

59:55.176 --> 59:58.846
Do you even know?
You don't even know, Danny!

59:59.847 --> 01:00:01.683
Fuck you!

01:00:07.522 --> 01:00:13.569
Did you get all that?
Look, it's OK. It's OK.

01:00:41.314 --> 01:00:45.893
- DANNY: Jackson? Sally?
- JACKSON: In here, Danny.

01:00:47.312 --> 01:00:50.523
- I need to talk to you.
- And we with you.

01:00:50.523 --> 01:00:53.985
There's so many things we need to
explain, we're just not sure how.

01:00:53.985 --> 01:00:57.780
SALLY: I am sure this is already
so overwhelming for you.

01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.158
- DANNY: You could say that again.
- And we're thrilled that you're...

01:01:00.158 --> 01:01:02.994
...interested in the hotel.
SALLY: But it's already

01:01:02.994 --> 01:01:06.080
just such a small aspect
of who we really are.

01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.416
DANNY: Who are you?

01:01:09.334 --> 01:01:12.045
I think it's better if we show you.

01:01:12.045 --> 01:01:14.380
But you got to come alone.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:18.134
There's members of the family
that have been aching to meet you.

01:01:18.134 --> 01:01:20.511
- DANNY: Let's go.
- JACKSON: Come on.

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:33.232
Wouldn't it be easier to use a flashlight?
It's the way we do things.

01:01:34.359 --> 01:01:36.444
You will see.

01:02:05.014 --> 01:02:05.815
(MOANING)

01:02:05.815 --> 01:02:08.267
- DANNY: Who are all these people?
- JACKSON: They're all kin...

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.311
...one way or another.
(GIRL LAUGHS)

01:02:10.311 --> 01:02:12.355
JACKSON: Come to welcome you home,
Danny.

(MOANING, GROWLING)

01:02:40.925 --> 01:02:42.802
How long have you been doing this?

01:02:42.802 --> 01:02:47.348
We have known each other since our clans
first set foot in these hills.

01:02:47.348 --> 01:02:50.601
There were three families
back in those days.

01:02:50.601 --> 01:02:53.938
The Craytons, the Boggles
and the Hillickers.

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:56.524
- Which am I?
- You're Hillicker, Danny.

01:02:56.524 --> 01:03:02.864
- And all of you?
- We're blood. Yeah.

01:22:24.482 --> 01:22:27.944
Danny, no.
I told you to leave.

01:22:27.944 --> 01:22:32.782
- I tried.
- You didn't listen. I couldn't.

01:22:34.367 --> 01:22:39.205
Now you have gone and killed one of us.
He was trying to kill me.

01:22:40.707 --> 01:22:43.801
- This isn't happening.
- I can't help you anymore.

01:22:46.204 --> 01:22:49.507
(SOBBING) Just stop, Danny!
This isn't you!

01:22:50.842 --> 01:22:52.093
No.

01:23:03.063 --> 01:23:04.439
It's family.

01:23:41.851 --> 01:23:44.312
You have a fantastic day, thank you.

DANNY: Hey, guys, how are you?
Find the place OK?

01:23:46.606 --> 01:23:48.483
Welcome to Hillicker Springs.

01:23:48.483 --> 01:23:51.444
Just you wait until you have
experienced our hot springs.

01:23:51.444 --> 01:23:56.199
Boy, are they to die for.
Now, go find your rooms, OK?

01:23:56.199 --> 01:24:00.370
Enjoy your stay.
I know I will.

01:24:02.789 --> 01:24:05.542
How are you ladies? Hi.

01:24:07.419 --> 01:24:10.588
Hey, how are you?
You enjoying our all-protein buffet?

01:24:10.588 --> 01:24:13.842
- I have already lost six pounds.
- Wow!

01:24:13.842 --> 01:24:17.303
Don't go disappearing on us now, OK?
(LAUGHS)

01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:26.312
Come on, boys, we have got
more important work to do, huh?

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:31.234
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.
Come on.

01:25:31.669 --> 01:25:33.338
Don't worry.

01:25:33.338 --> 01:25:38.676
We will keep trying and trying.
It's not that.

01:25:38.676 --> 01:25:43.807
What then, sweetie?
I am just happy.
