01:23.834 --> 01:25.460
This place is sweet.

01:25.544 --> 01:28.296
- What? The airport?
- No, the film festival, bro.

01:28.380 --> 01:29.922
Take it all in.

01:30.007 --> 01:32.300
Your first film festival
only happens once, Vince.

01:32.384 --> 01:34.927
I let my first one pass me by.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.387
Barely remember a thing.

01:36.472 --> 01:38.431
What was that first festival again, Drama?

01:38.515 --> 01:40.349
'Cause we barely remember it either.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.769
Palm Springs International '93.

01:42.853 --> 01:44.562
I was the toast of the town.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.147
I thought I told you guys about this.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.523
Fuck Palm Springs.

01:47.608 --> 01:49.650
Did they have 6 inches
of fresh powder over there?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.778
No, but they did have a sandstorm

01:51.862 --> 01:53.946
that nearly blew Bob Hope off the podium.

01:54.031 --> 01:56.491
I hear the slopes out here are insane.

01:56.575 --> 01:57.950
Give me a break.

01:58.035 --> 02:00.620
Anywhere you can ski
in short sleeves is for pussies.

02:00.704 --> 02:02.163
They got no ice out here.

02:02.247 --> 02:05.374
- Well, who wants to ski on ice?
- Men, E.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.794
- Men who like speed.
- I'm with Drama.

02:07.878 --> 02:09.211
There's nothing like the possibility

02:09.295 --> 02:10.713
of a good head-on collision.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.007
If you can ski Hunter Mountain,
you can ski anywhere.

02:13.091 --> 02:15.301
- Yeah.
- First, we're boarding, not skiing.

02:15.385 --> 02:17.595
Second of all, you guys
have been on boards twice.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.096
One of those times was in the store

02:19.181 --> 02:21.599
- when we were testing them.
- Sounds like a challenge.

02:21.683 --> 02:23.810
I'll put up a G for the first man down the hill,

02:23.894 --> 02:27.605
unless I win, then you all
have to walk home barefoot.

02:27.731 --> 02:28.773
- I'm in.
- I'm in.

02:28.857 --> 02:31.484
What's Sundance without
the spirit of competition? I'm in.

02:32.778 --> 02:35.196
Hey, E, you sure Cameron's coming?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.823
I don't see his name on any of these signs.

02:36.907 --> 02:38.199
It's in the bag.

02:38.283 --> 02:40.993
They're probably cleaning
the wings of his 767 right now.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.329
Or maybe he's got
some new vehicle that burrows

02:43.413 --> 02:45.373
its way through the center of the earth.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.834
Sorry, I'm late. The dog sled only does 30.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.961
- Hey, Shauna.
- Hi, you look gorgeous.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.546
- Thank you.
- How was the flight?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.548
- Good. Made it.
- Car's outside. Come on.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.842
- I'll catch up. I'm gonna hit the head.
- Hurry up.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.932
Nothin' like a good shit.

03:09.064 --> 03:11.440
Hey, give me
one of those towels, will you, kid?

03:14.570 --> 03:15.945
Here. Trash it.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.199
- Harvey, right?
- Yeah.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.451
I'm Eric Murphy. I represent Vincent Chase.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.662
Ari Gold represents Vincent Chase.

03:24.746 --> 03:26.455
Ari's his agent. I'm his manager.

03:26.582 --> 03:28.291
Tell me something. The managers, agents,

03:28.417 --> 03:30.167
what the hell is the difference
between you guys?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.961
Managers are the ones who care.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.841
That's good. I like that.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.467
You're not serious, are you?

03:40.262 --> 03:42.221
21A.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.890
Attention, please.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.726
United Airlines flight 6566...

03:46.810 --> 03:48.769
Guys, this is your driver Cassie.

03:48.854 --> 03:51.355
She's a good California girl, so be nice.

03:51.440 --> 03:53.065
Cassie's leaving on Sunday

03:53.150 --> 03:55.318
to track down dolphin poachers
for Greenpeace.

03:55.444 --> 03:58.696
Actually, it's not Greenpeace.
It's the Peace Corps.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.448
That's sweet. Hi.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.742
Whatever. This is Vincent, Turtle and Drama.

04:02.826 --> 04:05.161
Cassie, how you doin'? Peace Corps, huh?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.622
- Where you gonna be stationed?
- The Sudan.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.624
Those are some lucky Sudaners.

04:09.708 --> 04:12.752
That's called Sudanens, jackass.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.462
Actually, it's Sudanese,

04:14.546 --> 04:17.173
but with your accents, I'll let it slide.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.382
Watch out for these two.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.091
They get out of line, smack 'em.

04:20.177 --> 04:23.137
- Oh, no, they're sweet.
Smack 'em anyway.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.474
Let's go.
- Guess who's breaking bread at 2:50?

04:26.558 --> 04:29.602
- Who eats at 2:50?
- Harvey Weingard.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.229
Oh! Harvey's a prick to work for,
but he's a genius.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.649
Everything he touches turns to Oscar gold.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.275
You're the man, E.

04:36.360 --> 04:38.402
- Fantastic. Good job, man.
Thank you.

04:48.830 --> 04:51.415
I don't get why we have to share a room.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.001
Seriously. I need my own space to operate.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.630
Yo, guys. E found the movie.
E gets his own room.

04:58.215 --> 05:01.217
You can attack this gift basket
if you stop complaining.

05:01.301 --> 05:04.261
Multiple Sidekicks! EBay, baby!

05:04.346 --> 05:05.763
Yeah. What do I get?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.265
In Palm Springs,
I had a king-size bed all to myself.

05:08.350 --> 05:11.811
Yeah, he tried to bang a bunch
of senior citizens, but he's a non-closer!

05:11.895 --> 05:14.814
- Oh, you slay me, E.
- Drama, one more complaint out of you,

05:14.898 --> 05:16.482
and you're not getting
those two tickets I scored

05:16.566 --> 05:18.067
to the Alejandro what's-his-name's screening.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.695
- Teva! The Spanish Spielberg!
- Yeah.

05:20.779 --> 05:22.571
Thank you. I thought they were sold out.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.657
You know what? Fuck all you guys.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.993
When I score this guy's
matador movie next year,

05:27.077 --> 05:28.494
I'm gonna get my own condo.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.038
Well, let's go check out our quarters.

05:37.212 --> 05:39.130
You gotta be shittin' me.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.840
Bottom!

05:57.774 --> 06:00.109
Give me a call when you guys
want me to pick you up.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.944
What was that number again?

06:02.029 --> 06:04.405
Don't worry, I already got it. Come on!

06:11.788 --> 06:14.707
Drama, if you were a stand-up guy,

06:14.791 --> 06:17.209
you'd back off Cassie.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.378
- Why would I do that?
- Because I saw her first.

06:19.463 --> 06:22.048
Bullshit. I distinctly recall

06:22.132 --> 06:23.924
hitting the airport curb before you did.

06:24.009 --> 06:27.344
Actually, guys, I walked out
and I saw her first.

06:28.805 --> 06:31.015
Look at their faces! I'm kidding.

06:31.099 --> 06:32.850
There's a whole mountain full of women.

06:32.934 --> 06:35.061
- You guys are gonna compete over one?
- It's a little weird.

06:35.145 --> 06:37.730
You come to Utah to hit on
a girl from Pasadena?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.732
You can't choose who you fall for, bro.

06:39.816 --> 06:43.152
On the way here, I was dreaming
of hooking up with a nice Mormon girl.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.739
Why don't you go after a Mormon?
They're all over the place.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.283
Everyone knows they know how
to treat their men right.

06:49.367 --> 06:51.118
They're like Catholic girls times 100.

06:51.203 --> 06:53.537
You think the night before
a Mormon wedding a guy says,

06:53.622 --> 06:56.540
"How am I gonna sleep with the same
eight women for the rest of my life?"

06:56.625 --> 06:59.043
I've been married.
Loving one girl right is tough enough.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.004
- Loving eight would be impossible.
- Vince could do it.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.881
I don't know. What if I get divorced?

07:03.965 --> 07:05.966
Paying alimony would be a killer.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.844
Nah, they don't get half.
They only get an eighth.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.430
They get a ninth, you moron, or else
Vince would get left with nothing.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.225
You're looking out, E.
Always saving me money.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.685
- Oh! Oh!
- What? What?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.646
You don't let your guard down! Come on!

07:20.023 --> 07:22.858
- Don't take the bear!
- Oh!

07:22.943 --> 07:25.027
Oh, he went behind the back!

07:26.822 --> 07:28.489
Drop the girl!

07:28.573 --> 07:30.616
All right! I give, I give. I give.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.743
Got your ass Sonny Corleone-style, Gold.

07:32.828 --> 07:36.205
Good aim could keep you in
minimum wage for the rest of your life.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.125
What's up, man? You're on fire, baby.
You kidding me?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.418
Every distributor in town is here to see Q.B.

07:41.503 --> 07:43.045
Can he pick 'em, or what?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.172
Harvey Weingard, "King of Sundance,"
is looking to buy it, too.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.424
- How do you know?
- E stalked him in the airport bathroom.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.552
Really? Took the initiative. I like it.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.303
We should put a gold star on his forehead.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.764
I did a little more than take initiative.
I got us a lunch.

07:53.849 --> 07:57.059
- Bullshit.
- Yeah, it's true.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.519
2:50 today.

07:58.603 --> 08:01.230
2:50? Everyone knows 2:50
is a jerk-off meeting.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.524
What's he gonna do,
clear his throat until 3:00 comes?

08:03.608 --> 08:05.484
You don't have to worry about it,

08:05.569 --> 08:08.445
- 'cause he said not to bring you.
- Not to bring me? Really?

08:08.530 --> 08:10.156
Without me, he'd be producing

08:10.240 --> 08:11.866
Kevin Smith movies for the rest of his life.

08:11.950 --> 08:14.160
Guys, I gotta run
or I'm gonna miss the Teva flick.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.078
Are we not hitting the slopes at all today?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.914
Not me. I'm gonna grab Cassie

08:18.999 --> 08:21.834
and introduce her
to Spanish New Wave cinema, brother.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.336
- New Wave is French.
- It's still in Europe.

08:24.421 --> 08:25.546
Yeah, Europe.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.923
You really want to go head-to-head with me?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.301
Bring it on, bitch. Toodleoo.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.095
ARl:
Go back, put on the gloves. I go in,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.764
'cause they're real and beautiful.
And I celebrate them.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.517
Hey, don't let him kid you.
This guy's a fagelah!

08:38.602 --> 08:41.477
Good to see you, baby.
You know Vinnie Chase.

08:41.563 --> 08:42.813
- Vinnie.
- Yes.

08:42.898 --> 08:44.565
- Hello, Vincent.
- Hello.

08:44.649 --> 08:46.650
- Eric.
- Yeah, hi.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.655
- Ticket?
- Sidekick?

08:55.327 --> 08:58.370
Sonny Bono presented me
with the bronze ribbon himself.

08:58.455 --> 09:00.789
My mom's got it hanging up in the foyer.

09:00.874 --> 09:03.125
Wow. Sonny Bono.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.960
Did you ever meet Cher?

09:06.213 --> 09:08.464
No, but I did play racquetball

09:08.548 --> 09:10.341
with Rob Camilletti for years.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.509
Hey, guys.
- Hey!

09:12.594 --> 09:15.095
Could you slide down one? Thank you.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.725
What'd I miss?

09:19.809 --> 09:21.560
First time I came to Park City,

09:21.645 --> 09:23.479
just to give you an idea,

09:23.563 --> 09:25.481
Redford was fucking Sonia Braga.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.067
Harvey, it's 2:54. We got six minutes left.

09:28.151 --> 09:31.278
- Let's talk about something real.
- I know about Cameron.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.365
The big shaygitz is coming tomorrow.
The big Jew is here today.

09:34.449 --> 09:36.784
And I don't have to see Queens Boulevard

09:36.868 --> 09:38.160
to validate you, my friend.

09:38.245 --> 09:41.497
- So what do you got?
- Whoa, Eric, aggressive. I like that.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.917
What I got is a book.
It's an adaptation of a Kem Nunn novel.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.795
- You know it, Tapping the Source?
- The surfing thing?

09:47.879 --> 09:50.297
I've been trying to make
this movie for 15 years.

09:50.382 --> 09:53.717
And I'm just looking for the right actor
to ride the wave with me.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.469
I read a draft of that script. It's pretty good.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.305
- It's fucking great!
- I thought Josh Hartnett was doing it.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.182
Hartnett's out. He has no motor skills.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.476
He can't stand up on a moving object.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.687
So what do you boys think?

10:04.771 --> 10:06.772
I have excellent hand-eye coordination.

10:06.856 --> 10:08.607
Great. We start shooting in Australia

10:08.692 --> 10:10.526
in three weeks. See you there.

10:11.736 --> 10:12.861
Bye.

10:20.245 --> 10:22.955
Bravo! Bravo!

10:28.169 --> 10:30.212
Bravo! Bravo!

10:30.297 --> 10:32.131
Jesus! You're like the proud mother, Drama!

10:32.215 --> 10:33.799
Shut up, Turtle. The guy's a god.

10:33.883 --> 10:36.051
Johnny's very passionate.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.262
Passion is my business, honey.

10:39.014 --> 10:40.222
Don't call her "honey. "

10:40.307 --> 10:41.974
Okay, we'll begin the Q&A.

10:43.393 --> 10:47.146
- You up there.
- Great film! Congratulations!

10:47.230 --> 10:48.897
Very powerful stuff, Alejandro.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.276
I notice you use a lot
of authentic people in films.

10:52.360 --> 10:58.240
Authentic people are so much better
than cartoons or robots.

10:58.325 --> 11:00.617
That's a good one, Drama.

11:00.702 --> 11:02.411
Blow me, dickhead.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.872
Okay, next?
- Wait. I'm not finished.

11:04.956 --> 11:06.373
It's only one question per person.

11:06.458 --> 11:08.500
That wasn't a question, that was a statement.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.837
- Sounded like a question to me.
- No, this is a question,

11:11.921 --> 11:13.505
in two parts.

11:13.923 --> 11:17.051
Are you interested in seeing any films
while you're here, Alejandro?

11:17.135 --> 11:20.554
And would you ever consider an American
with some Chilean blood in him

11:20.638 --> 11:22.765
for the part of Raoul in The Bull Fighter?

11:22.849 --> 11:26.977
I would consider anyone
who would bring truth to the role.

11:27.062 --> 11:29.897
Good, 'cause I'm the sixth lead
in Queens Boulevard,

11:29.981 --> 11:32.941
and I would be delighted
if you would be my guest.

11:39.532 --> 11:40.949
What do you think?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.619
If the dates don't conflict
with Aquaman, it sounds great.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.622
Vincent, this is Jen and Corine.
They're corporate publicists.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.291
I'm the one who sends you your cases
of Budweiser every month.

11:49.376 --> 11:51.126
But I'm the one that sent you your Maserati.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.003
Vincent, please don't drink and drive.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.005
Hi, girls. Nice to see you. Find real work.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.465
Vinnie, I need you. Come here.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.759
And that's Ari Gold, and he's a real asshole.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.762
- I just got done with Harvey.
- And?

12:01.846 --> 12:05.641
Grab your scuba tanks,
because we are going to Australia, baby.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.559
Melbourne. The Gold Coast.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.269
The Great Barrier "Reefer madness. "

12:09.354 --> 12:11.772
We don't understand
how we're gonna do both movies.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.232
We're not gonna do both.

12:13.316 --> 12:14.566
So what, we have to pick one?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.360
No, we don't. It's a no-brainer.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.569
It's been picked for us.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.071
One is real and the other isn't.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.906
We had Cameron come watch
the movie for nothing?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.074
We didn't have him watch it for nothing.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.034
We used this to leverage something real.

12:24.119 --> 12:27.663
You don't come to Sundance
for the snow, you come for the heat.

12:28.123 --> 12:30.082
Africa's great. You're gonna love it.

12:30.166 --> 12:32.251
Give me a buzz if you see any seven-footers.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.461
My cousin Joey's a scout at St. John's.

12:34.546 --> 12:37.756
How did you know the Sudan was in Africa,
Mr. Geography?

12:37.841 --> 12:39.800
I know everything about the Sudan.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.927
For example, it's in Northern Africa.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.138
Population 38 million. Give or take a few.

12:44.222 --> 12:46.265
Their currency is the "dinar. "

12:46.349 --> 12:49.935
Their major exports are oil,
petroleum products and ground nuts.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.687
Wow, Turtle.

12:51.771 --> 12:56.525
It's great you have this
intellectual curiosity for the Sudanese.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.902
I'm a humanitarian at heart.

12:58.987 --> 13:01.780
Especially when it comes
to indigenous cultures.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.949
Yeah, I'm curious, too.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.617
How the fuck did you know all that?

13:05.702 --> 13:08.036
I googled it, motherfucker. Keep up.

13:09.747 --> 13:11.957
ARl:
$3 million and it goes in three weeks.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.792
The money will be in Vinnie's bank account

13:13.877 --> 13:15.669
before he touches down in Sydney. Boom!

13:15.753 --> 13:17.588
Can't we stall Harvey till Cameron
sees Queens Boulevard?

13:17.672 --> 13:18.964
You can't stall Harvey. You out of your mind?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.300
He's gonna announce this before
the premiere of Queens Boulevard.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.635
He knows how to maximize his press.
Here's the deal.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.471
Don't fuck this thing up again.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.724
Tapping the Source is
an unbelievable opportunity for you.

13:28.892 --> 13:31.935
Whoa, Ari. James Cameron
flew all the way here just to see me,

13:32.020 --> 13:34.396
and you just wanna blow it off?

13:36.399 --> 13:37.858
What?

13:37.942 --> 13:39.526
Ari?

13:39.611 --> 13:40.861
Are you hyperventilating?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.738
- No, I...
- What is it, the altitude?

13:42.822 --> 13:44.740
- No, he...
- Want me to call the paramedics?

13:44.824 --> 13:47.034
He didn't just come to see you.

13:47.118 --> 13:49.495
Who else did he come to see?

13:49.579 --> 13:52.247
He came to see...
Ryan Gosling's got a movie here.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.750
James Franco.
There's a lot of guys that have movies here.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.002
You are on a short list for Aquaman.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.463
- But you're on a list.
- Do you ever tell the truth?

13:59.547 --> 14:01.340
I tell the parts that matter.

14:01.424 --> 14:03.509
I didn't think this would come up.
This is meant to be.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.178
Vinnie, I am telling you.
And it's right there for us.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.889
- Should I tell Harvey yes, or...
- Hold on, Ari.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.183
- No problem.
- Just give me a second to think.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.392
Take your time, baby.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.520
E?

14:14.604 --> 14:16.480
What are you hearing about
the Gosling and Franco movies?

14:16.564 --> 14:18.065
- They good?
- I hear they're great.

14:18.149 --> 14:21.527
I hear every movie at Sundance
is the best movie ever made.

14:21.611 --> 14:22.986
- I don't know.
- Well?

14:23.071 --> 14:25.489
You know, it sounds like
the safe move, Vince.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.282
- What do you want me to say?
- It's the only move.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.369
Okay.

14:30.453 --> 14:31.620
Fine.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.956
Tell Harvey "no fucking Speedos. "

14:34.040 --> 14:36.875
There you go, baby. Men at Work.
The Land Down Under.

14:36.960 --> 14:40.045
We're gonna get drunk with Russell Crowe
and we're gonna head-butt some kangaroos.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.646
Yo, you think this is a cash bar?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.026
I'm getting Vince.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.778
You get the little one.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.947
What? He's cute, too.

15:07.031 --> 15:08.365
Bullshit!

15:08.449 --> 15:11.535
I gave you Jake Gyllenhaal in Telluride.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.955
We all loved you in The Station Agent, Peter.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.374
Fucking hope so.
That's why I signed on with you people.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.752
If you would've signed earlier,
we could've slipped you into Bad Santa.

15:20.837 --> 15:23.088
Actually, I passed on that. Thank you.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.507
You're one of the biggest actors
in this town, Peter.

15:25.592 --> 15:27.634
What is that, a play on words, dickhead?

15:27.719 --> 15:30.470
I tolerate agents. I don't like them.

15:32.181 --> 15:34.016
Peter!

15:34.100 --> 15:37.144
- Don't listen to a word this bum says.
- Fuck off, Harvey.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.813
Whoa, he's an angry little fucker, isn't he?

15:39.897 --> 15:41.356
- Tiny meshuguna.
- You all right?

15:41.441 --> 15:43.442
What's the word, Ari, on the picture?

15:43.526 --> 15:44.610
You ready to get wet, big man?

15:44.694 --> 15:47.029
Let's go surfing. We are in.

15:47.196 --> 15:48.739
- Yes! Okay.
- Yes, we're in.

15:48.823 --> 15:50.282
- There they are right there.
- Where?

15:50.366 --> 15:53.452
Look, Vinnie's right there.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.203
See you in Australia!

15:55.288 --> 15:56.913
It's all a matter of preference.

15:56.998 --> 15:59.750
Do you prefer tall, lean and handsome?

16:00.376 --> 16:04.129
Or short, fat and ugly?

16:04.213 --> 16:06.715
You know what? He's right.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.885
Do you want somebody
who's cute, funny and cuddly?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.512
Or somebody who's bitter, out of work

16:12.597 --> 16:14.139
and losing his hair by the minute?

16:14.223 --> 16:15.974
- I'm not losing my hair.
- Yeah, you are.

16:16.059 --> 16:18.060
Guys, I believe in love.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.813
And love has no face,

16:21.898 --> 16:23.815
and no weight,

16:23.900 --> 16:26.151
definitely no receding hairline.

16:26.235 --> 16:29.613
Look, I want to talk to you both
about something.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.992
Best friends should treat each other

16:34.077 --> 16:36.161
with loyalty and respect.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.581
They should never compete
for the same woman.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.042
Because even if one of them wins,

16:42.126 --> 16:44.670
then they both lose.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.672
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.715
You guys figure out a way to get along,

16:48.800 --> 16:50.509
and I will be right back.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.261
That was deep.

16:56.391 --> 16:58.266
She's right.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.394
This is crazy. What are we fightin' for?

17:00.478 --> 17:03.105
This girl's gonna be gone by tomorrow.

17:03.439 --> 17:06.233
By tomorrow night, she'll be a memory.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.361
And we gotta spend
every waking minute together.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.195
So what do you want to do?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.531
- I want the memory.
- So do I.

17:13.616 --> 17:16.201
- Fuck you!
- Fuck me? Fuck you!

17:16.703 --> 17:17.828
I said it first.

17:17.912 --> 17:21.248
Shauna tells me that James Cameron
flew all the way out here

17:21.332 --> 17:24.376
- just to see your movie.
- Well, yeah, sort of.

17:24.460 --> 17:27.587
God, that is so cool.
I lived for Titanic in high school.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.172
Oh, my God. Me, too.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.591
I must have seen it like, 400 times.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.344
E,

17:35.847 --> 17:38.974
how many times did we see
Aliens in high school?

17:39.767 --> 17:41.143
What are we doing?

17:41.894 --> 17:44.062
- We're playing it safe.
- Since when do we do that?

17:44.147 --> 17:46.857
Since you got yourself millions in overhead.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.401
James Cameron. This is once-in-a-lifetime.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.570
I mean, the guy makes
a movie every ten years.

17:51.654 --> 17:54.906
I'm with you, but I can't keep
telling you to take these crazy chances.

17:54.991 --> 17:57.117
This is your life.
It's not mine to fuck around with.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.578
This is our life. Don't forget that, all right?

17:59.662 --> 18:01.121
I need you acting from your gut.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.749
That's why I have you here.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.751
What if he doesn't like Queens Boulevard?

18:05.835 --> 18:07.961
So we'll do another commercial.

18:08.045 --> 18:11.715
Maybe Cassie will help us
sell Pepsi to the Sudanese.

18:14.844 --> 18:18.054
Come on, you want to roll the dice?

18:18.806 --> 18:20.766
Yeah, I want to roll the dice.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.851
Good. Let's roll the dice.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.311
Should I call Ari right now?

18:24.395 --> 18:26.438
Hey, are you guys gonna yap all night,

18:26.522 --> 18:28.732
or are we gonna party?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.276
We'll see him at breakfast.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.861
We'll see him in the morning.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.034
I shouldn't.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.787
Come on.
You're going away to Africa for two years.

18:41.871 --> 18:44.539
They got nothing
but shit bush-weed over there.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.876
You know, Cassie, you've inspired me.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.795
I'm not gonna join the Corps, per se,

18:49.879 --> 18:51.963
but I think when I get home,
I'm gonna log in some time

18:52.048 --> 18:53.632
downtown at the soup kitchen.

18:53.716 --> 18:58.428
You know, every time I see
a homeless person, I cry.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.640
- Seriously.
- Come on.

19:01.724 --> 19:03.350
Guys, are you for real,

19:03.434 --> 19:07.103
or is this an act and you're both
still trying to get with me?

19:07.980 --> 19:10.148
Actually, I'm still trying to get with you.

19:10.233 --> 19:14.069
Me too. I'm just a way better actor than he is.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.613
Look, Cassie,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.032
this is our last night together.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.868
If you're interested in either of us,

19:21.953 --> 19:24.120
we think you should choose.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.747
Yeah, who's it gonna be?

19:50.773 --> 19:52.399
What?

20:05.496 --> 20:08.498
Why don't you guys show me
your bunk beds?

20:41.782 --> 20:45.368
- Hey, good luck on the premiere.
- Hey, thanks, my friend.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.955
Come on, Drama, don't be a dick.

20:49.040 --> 20:50.749
Don't touch me, Turtle!

20:50.833 --> 20:52.584
I can't hear you. I can't see you.

20:52.668 --> 20:54.419
I don't even wanna know you.

20:54.503 --> 20:55.712
You're yelling, all right?

20:55.796 --> 20:57.756
What's your problem, Drama?

20:57.840 --> 20:59.424
Me and Drama had a little incident.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.760
- What kind of incident?
- Don't fucking say it.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.345
No, no, say it.

21:06.974 --> 21:09.017
We accidentally crossed swords.

21:09.101 --> 21:10.810
Really?

21:12.855 --> 21:14.439
Were there any women there at least?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.192
Yeah, dick, it was a threesome, okay?
It's no biggie.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.194
Crossing is an occupational hazard.

21:19.987 --> 21:21.363
Guess who just closed a deal

21:21.447 --> 21:23.657
on the new Osmond
pay-per-view Christmas special?

21:23.741 --> 21:26.451
NC-17, baby.
Gonna get Marie to undo the top button.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.078
I gotta go find Alejandro.

21:28.162 --> 21:30.205
Don't be an asshole.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.498
- Ari.
- What's up?

21:31.582 --> 21:33.792
- We got a problem.
- What's up, Vinnie?

21:33.876 --> 21:35.961
- We need to talk.
- What's going on?

21:36.045 --> 21:38.213
E's gonna talk.
I'm gonna go talk to Peter Sarsgaard.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.714
All right.

21:41.384 --> 21:42.842
- What's goin' on?
- We decided we're gonna wait

21:42.927 --> 21:44.511
for James Cameron to see Queens Boulevard.

21:44.595 --> 21:45.845
Very funny. What's up?

21:45.930 --> 21:47.722
No joke. Seriously. Tell Harvey thanks,

21:47.807 --> 21:50.725
- but we'll catch him on the next one.
- You don't flip-flop on Harvey.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.644
- He's about to do a press conference.
- You should stop him

21:52.728 --> 21:54.354
- to avoid a problem.
- He's right in there.

21:54.480 --> 21:56.314
Why don't you go stop him?

21:57.108 --> 21:59.234
- Fine. He's in here?
- Yeah.

22:00.361 --> 22:03.488
- Vincent.
- Good luck, Vince.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.865
There you are.
I was getting ready to call in the dogs.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.909
- I'm right here.
- There's my guy.

22:07.994 --> 22:11.663
- Hey, Billy. What's up?
- I hope this thing doesn't suck.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.540
Since when do you worry?

22:13.624 --> 22:15.375
I had a dream last night people hated it.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.085
They tore me and you to pieces.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.672
I shaved my head. I'm a fuckin' mess.

22:20.756 --> 22:22.799
I'm sure it's great.
Have you shown it to anybody?

22:22.883 --> 22:25.218
- Me, my editor, and my mother.
- What'd your mother think?

22:25.302 --> 22:28.596
She thought it was garbage,
but she's a fuckin' moron.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.598
- ARl: Mr. Walsh!
- Fuck off, supersuit!

22:30.683 --> 22:32.559
I don't talk to people like you
before a screening.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.060
Flatter me! Listen to me.

22:34.145 --> 22:36.354
- I made up my mind. Let it go.
- You don't wanna...

22:36.439 --> 22:38.440
What will be will be.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.069
We better get in there now.

22:45.322 --> 22:47.949
Stop grinding me. I'm not gonna say it again.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.868
It ain't intentional, asshole.

22:49.952 --> 22:51.953
Check it out. It's Cameron.

22:54.665 --> 22:58.710
That Vincent Chase is
the coolest kid I ever seen.

22:58.794 --> 23:00.378
I'd go see any movie he was in

23:00.463 --> 23:03.089
even if it was a big piece of shit!

23:03.174 --> 23:05.216
One more question, Mr. Cameron.

23:05.301 --> 23:06.843
Was the sinking of the ship

23:06.927 --> 23:08.344
an attempt to foreshadow

23:08.429 --> 23:11.056
the forthcoming sinking
of the tech market in 2000?

23:11.140 --> 23:14.392
No. Actually, I just wanted
to make young girls cry.

23:14.477 --> 23:16.895
Can I get some
of the Sour Patch Kids, please?

23:16.979 --> 23:18.521
You little shitbag!

23:18.606 --> 23:21.149
You wanted a job for Vince.
And now you fucked me?

23:21.233 --> 23:22.776
Do you know who I am?

23:22.860 --> 23:24.778
You're gonna beg to get back
into the pizza business!

23:24.862 --> 23:26.112
I'm trying to do what's best...

23:26.197 --> 23:28.198
Ah, fuck you! You and that fucking kid!

23:28.282 --> 23:30.617
The two of you are about
to go down a river of shit!

23:30.701 --> 23:32.744
You hear me? That's it. You're finished.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.538
I will never offer that kid a fucking job again!

23:36.624 --> 23:38.958
Ari Gold's gonna catch a smack, too!

23:42.171 --> 23:44.130
Fucking Harvey.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.591
Is this on?

23:46.675 --> 23:49.344
Okay, good. Thank you all for coming.

23:49.762 --> 23:52.931
I just wanna take this time to thank

23:53.015 --> 23:56.768
our brilliant director Mr. Walsh.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.394
- Yeah!
- Vinnie!

23:58.479 --> 24:02.148
And I would also like
to thank Vinnie over here.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.735
Yeah, Vince!

24:07.321 --> 24:10.448
The guy's a fucking genius.
Say something, Vinnie.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.659
Thanks, Billy.

24:12.743 --> 24:14.702
The guy's a great director.

24:20.042 --> 24:22.001
I hope you like the movie. And if you don't,

24:22.086 --> 24:23.878
Billy's staying at the Marriott in room 512.

24:28.134 --> 24:30.802
Oh, and if anybody's gotta use the can,

24:30.886 --> 24:33.805
the movie's running
almost four hours, so do it now.

24:33.889 --> 24:35.682
Thank you.

24:35.766 --> 24:37.016
Four fuckin' hours?

24:39.562 --> 24:42.480
You made a four-hour movie?

24:42.565 --> 24:45.441
This is my fucking Deer Hunter, Rick.

24:48.779 --> 24:50.655
How'd it go with Harvey?

24:50.739 --> 24:53.283
- Fine. He wished you luck tonight.
- Yeah? Cool.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.412
- Here we go.
Come on.

25:19.226 --> 25:22.353
Four hours long, and they cut me out
of the whole fucking movie!

25:22.438 --> 25:24.647
But the line you spoke

25:24.732 --> 25:27.025
was delivered with such angst, Johnny.

25:27.735 --> 25:29.485
Thank you, Alejandro.

25:29.570 --> 25:31.196
I do have an abundance of that.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.864
You are amazing. That was brilliant!

25:32.948 --> 25:35.033
This is going to do great shit for your career.

25:35.117 --> 25:36.951
We got press to do tomorrow morning,

25:37.036 --> 25:39.621
- so don't party too hard tonight.
- That movie played great.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.039
I'll bet you Cameron loved it.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.917
- What?
- I don't want to say anything.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.252
- But he left pretty early on.
- How early on?

25:46.337 --> 25:48.504
- 10 minutes in.
- Fuck.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.548
That can't be good.

25:50.633 --> 25:54.385
Yo, I just got an audition for
the next Alejandro Teva film.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.806
What, you guys aren't happy for me?

25:58.891 --> 26:01.559
- Cameron left after 10 minutes.
- Fuck it!

26:01.644 --> 26:04.020
We're scorching hot in the indie world.
You kiddin' me?

26:04.104 --> 26:06.064
You hear it in there? They loved us.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.816
We can make art house flicks
for the next 10 years.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.318
Who wants a shot of Jack?

26:14.073 --> 26:16.491
Fuck it! Let's go boarding.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.413
We probably should have taken a lesson

26:22.498 --> 26:23.581
before we came up here.

26:24.166 --> 26:26.751
This hill is a lot bigger
than the one I did at Big Bear.

26:27.169 --> 26:28.419
Maybe Cassie's right,

26:28.504 --> 26:31.005
competition amongst friends
isn't such a great idea.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.179
Yeah?

26:39.556 --> 26:41.099
Yeah, he's right here.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.268
It's Ari. Says it's an emergency.

26:43.352 --> 26:45.228
Ho! What's up?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.647
Vinnie, say hello to James Cameron.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.941
Call me Jim, Vince.

26:51.235 --> 26:52.443
Okay, Jim.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.654
What's happenin'?

26:54.863 --> 26:56.489
I could only stay for a bit of the film.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.450
But I've got to tell you,
it was all I needed to see.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.370
How'd you like to come play Aquaman for me?

27:02.913 --> 27:05.665
Sure, I could do that for you.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.710
Fantastic. Let's get together next week.
We'll talk about it.

27:09.003 --> 27:10.378
Okay, great.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.547
I'll see you then. Looking forward to it.

27:12.798 --> 27:14.757
Talk to you later. Bye.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.513
Cameron just offered me Aquaman.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.307
- What?
- Yes!

27:22.391 --> 27:24.434
- Yeah, baby!
- Good job, E.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.395
Gotta figure out a way
to get you off this mountain.

27:27.479 --> 27:30.231
I don't need you breaking your neck
before you start this movie.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.108
Are you kidding? We just got Aquaman!

27:32.735 --> 27:34.152
I'm raising the stakes.

27:34.236 --> 27:36.154
10 G's to the first guy who gets down there.

27:36.238 --> 27:39.699
- 10 G's?
- I'll give you a head start, Turtle.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.246
Later.
