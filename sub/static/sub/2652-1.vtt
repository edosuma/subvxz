We'll stop by a little pharmacy

get you some Merthiolate

What the hell are we gonna do?

58:58.493 --> 59:00.621
What's in the file?

59:14.468 --> 59:16.061
Look, listen to me.

59:16.219 --> 59:18.221
Komarov and
Chagarin used to have this

59:18.388 --> 59:22.814
nasty little side-racket
going on back in the day.

59:24.853 --> 59:28.027
They siphoned weapons-grade
uranium, got greedy,

59:28.648 --> 59:31.071
caused the meltdown.

59:32.652 --> 59:35.826
Then, you know, they fell out.

59:36.031 --> 59:38.659
Former partners, bad break-up.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.878
Scumbags.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.748
So, Chagarin had
Komarov thrown in jail.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.589
You know, put him in a hole,
forget about him.

59:47.751 --> 59:49.674
Doesn't have to worry anymore.

59:51.171 --> 59:53.390
So what happened to rescuesque?

59:54.007 --> 59:56.180
Well, he grew a conscience.

59:58.053 --> 01:00:00.681
Yeah, well, that figures.

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:05.068
Listen, Chagarin is bad news.
He's the real deal.

01:00:05.227 --> 01:00:08.948
If we see this guy in control, we're
gonna see the whole thing fall apart.

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:26.749
Well, that's what we do.

01:00:28.542 --> 01:00:33.139
We go out to Chiapep
and we do our thing.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.467

and kill a lot of scumbags.

something better to do?

01:00:50.480 --> 01:00:53.450

This is you,
five years from now.

01:34:08.226 --> 01:34:10.228
It's rainwater.
You'll be fine.

01:34:10.395 --> 01:34:13.569
Besides, it's hard
to kill a McClane.

01:34:15.066 --> 01:34:16.943
Now you're a McClane?

01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:20.410
Yeah, I'm a McClane.
John McClane.

01:34:20.572 --> 01:34:22.074
John McClane Junior.

01:34:23.074 --> 01:34:25.543
Well, that makes you a "senior."

01:34:25.702 --> 01:34:27.204
That's right.

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:28.917
Try not to forget it.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.753
I'm your father.

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:34.924
Have some respect
for your father.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:37.092
Let me ask you something.

01:34:39.132 --> 01:34:41.260
Do you go looking for trouble

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.554
or does it always
just seem to find you?

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:48.608
You know,
after all these years,

01:34:49.475 --> 01:34:52.228
I still ask myself
the same question.

01:35:25.303 --> 01:35:27.101
<font color="#D900D9">(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)</font>

01:35:31.226 --> 01:35:35.356
<i>I had a dream last night
That I was piloting a plane</i>

01:35:35.521 --> 01:35:39.025
<i>And all the passengers
were drunk and insane</i>

01:35:39.150 --> 01:35:42.370
<i>I crash landed
in a Louisiana swamp</i>

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:45.995
<i>Shot up a horde of zombies
But I come out on top</i>

01:35:46.074 --> 01:35:48.202
<i>What's it all about?</i>

01:35:48.326 --> 01:35:51.626
<i>Guess it just reflects my mood</i>

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:57.256
<i>Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt</i>

01:35:57.335 --> 01:36:02.842
<i>All I hear is doom and gloom</i>

01:36:04.342 --> 01:36:08.597
<i>And all is darkness</i>

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.808
<i>In my room</i>

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:17.356
<i>Through the light,
your face I see</i>

01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:24.117
<i>Baby, take a chance Baby,
won't you dance with me</i>

01:36:26.447 --> 01:36:29.701
<i>Lost all that treasure
in an overseas war</i>

01:36:29.784 --> 01:36:33.630
<i>It just goes to show you
don't get what you paid for</i>

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:37.125
<i>Battle to the rich
and you worry about the poor</i>

01:36:37.208 --> 01:36:41.088
<i>Put my feet up on the couch
And lock all the doors</i>

01:36:41.170 --> 01:36:42.547
<i>What's that funky noise?</i>

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:46.601
<i>It's the tightening
of the screws</i>

01:36:47.969 --> 01:36:51.769
<i>Sitting in the dirt
Feeling kind of hurt</i>

01:36:51.973 --> 01:36:57.355
<i>All I hear is doom and gloom</i>

01:36:59.355 --> 01:37:02.199
<i>But when those drums</i>

01:37:02.275 --> 01:37:05.154
<i>Go boom, boom, boom</i>

01:37:06.362 --> 01:37:09.536
<i>Through the night</i>

01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:13.165
<i>Your face I see</i>

01:37:13.536 --> 01:37:19.384
<i>Baby, take a chance Baby,
won't you dance with me</i>

01:37:21.669 --> 01:37:22.670
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:37:22.962 --> 01:37:27.308
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:29.101
<i>Ah, yeah</i>

01:37:49.447 --> 01:37:53.668
<i>Fracking deep for oil But
there's nothing in the sump</i>

01:37:53.743 --> 01:37:57.373
<i>There's kids all picking
at the garbage dump</i>

01:37:57.455 --> 01:38:01.050
<i>I am running out of water
so I better prime the pump</i>

01:38:01.125 --> 01:38:05.301
<i>I am trying to stay sober
but I end up drunk</i>

01:38:05.380 --> 01:38:10.136
<i>We'll be eating dirt Living
on the side of the road</i>

01:38:12.303 --> 01:38:14.146
<i>There's some food for thought</i>

01:38:14.222 --> 01:38:17.977
<i>Kind of makes your head explode</i>

01:38:19.727 --> 01:38:21.445
<i>Feeling kind of hurt</i>

01:38:22.105 --> 01:38:23.277
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:26.360
<i>But all I hear</i>

01:38:26.484 --> 01:38:29.283
<i>Is doom and gloom</i>

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:34.751
<i>And all is darkness</i>

01:38:34.826 --> 01:38:37.170
<i>In my room</i>

01:38:37.703 --> 01:38:40.832
<i>Through the night</i>

01:38:40.915 --> 01:38:44.135
<i>Your face I see</i>

01:38:45.461 --> 01:38:47.714
<i>Baby, take a chance</i>

01:38:48.297 --> 01:38:51.517
<i>Won't you dance with me</i>

01:38:51.926 --> 01:38:53.223
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:38:53.594 --> 01:38:54.595
<i>Come on!</i>

01:38:55.096 --> 01:38:57.849
<i>Baby, won't you dance with me</i>

01:38:59.684 --> 01:39:01.778

01:39:05.606 --> 01:39:07.324
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.118
