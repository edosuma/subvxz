00:40.631 --> 00:43.634
PAIN AND GLORY

02:49.009 --> 02:51.845
I'd like to be a man
so I could swim naked in the river.

02:52.554 --> 02:55.349
- Come on!
- What an idea!

02:55.391 --> 02:59.102
And the water could get in
all around your cooch.

02:59.144 --> 03:01.313
- That'd be nice!
- Wouldn't it?

03:01.355 --> 03:03.357
Before you jump in,

03:03.398 --> 03:05.985
lift him off me, he's breaking my back.

03:07.111 --> 03:08.445
Come on, Salvador.

03:11.739 --> 03:13.867
Here's a stick to play with.

03:13.909 --> 03:15.161
Alright.

03:15.201 --> 03:16.953
Help me with the sheets.

03:16.995 --> 03:17.997
Coming...

03:22.542 --> 03:24.253
The little soap fish!

03:24.295 --> 03:25.713
There they are!

03:27.755 --> 03:29.175
The little soap fish!

03:29.215 --> 03:31.010
Sing us something, Rosita.

03:31.051 --> 03:32.261
They're lovely.

03:34.012 --> 03:35.346
Look at them.

03:55.618 --> 03:57.453
Salvita, don't move from there.

05:01.641 --> 05:02.809
Salva!

05:03.643 --> 05:05.103
I'm Zulema!

05:06.105 --> 05:09.650
What a surprise! This is wonderful!

05:11.110 --> 05:14.362
Have you time for a coffee
or are you in a hurry?

05:14.405 --> 05:17.366
If you don't write or film,
what will you do?

05:17.949 --> 05:19.868
Live, I guess.

05:19.910 --> 05:21.453
I can't live without acting.

05:21.494 --> 05:23.329
It gets harder all the time,

05:23.372 --> 05:26.208
but I do everything I'm offered.

05:26.249 --> 05:28.877
Do you see Alberto?
I believe he was in Argentina.

05:28.919 --> 05:30.337
No, in Mexico.

05:30.379 --> 05:33.756
He was working on some soaps,
but he's back now.

05:33.799 --> 05:38.179
Eh, I met him at a Latino film festival

05:38.220 --> 05:39.679
on the Mayan Riviera.

05:39.722 --> 05:42.099
He was charming. High, of course,

05:42.141 --> 05:45.686
but it was a really nice reunion.

05:47.021 --> 05:49.439
- Have you seen him?
- No, no.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.900
I haven't seen him
since the premiere of Sabor.

05:51.941 --> 05:53.360
But that was...

05:53.985 --> 05:55.028
30 years ago?

05:55.069 --> 05:56.362
Thirty-two.

05:58.239 --> 06:01.285
You know, I saw the film again last week.

06:02.203 --> 06:03.578
Hadn't you seen it again?

06:03.621 --> 06:05.289
Not since the premiere.

06:06.165 --> 06:09.126
And I shouldn't say this, but it moved me.

06:09.167 --> 06:11.461
I've always loved it.

06:12.254 --> 06:14.756
The Cinematheque has restored the negative

06:14.797 --> 06:16.966
and they're doing several screenings.

06:17.593 --> 06:20.345
They asked me to present it,
and I'd like to do it with Alberto.

06:20.386 --> 06:22.430
I'm glad you don't hold a grudge.

06:22.473 --> 06:24.891
The bastard never played
the character I'd written.

06:26.727 --> 06:28.562
At the time I wanted to kill him,

06:29.521 --> 06:32.899
but really I don't hold a grudge.

06:33.566 --> 06:36.862
His performance is better now
than 30 years ago.

06:37.946 --> 06:40.074
It's your eyes that have changed, darling.

06:41.199 --> 06:42.408
The film is the same.

06:44.244 --> 06:45.870
Do you know how to contact him?

06:47.038 --> 06:48.915
He lives in El Escorial,

06:49.624 --> 06:51.668
in someone's house.

06:51.710 --> 06:54.672
He works occasionally.

06:54.713 --> 06:58.592
He's well, without giving up...
you know what I mean.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.972
I'm surprised
that you're the one not working.

07:03.013 --> 07:06.016
I always thought you'd never retire.

07:06.057 --> 07:07.267
So did I.

07:08.018 --> 07:10.688
- Is your number still the same?
- Yes.

07:10.728 --> 07:13.857
I'll send you his details and mine too,

07:13.898 --> 07:17.569
in case you get bored
and write something that only I can do.

08:00.612 --> 08:03.114
Stop here.
I'll leave you with Fr. José María.

08:03.824 --> 08:05.451
Good morning, boys.

08:05.492 --> 08:08.912
First we'll choose
who will be in the choir.

08:10.288 --> 08:13.333
If anyone has sung in a choir before,
raise your hand.

08:15.044 --> 08:16.921
Well, we'll try you out.

08:17.838 --> 08:19.797
You, come here.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.134
- What's your name?
- Rodolfo.

08:22.175 --> 08:25.053
Let's see how you vocalize.

08:25.095 --> 08:26.054
Repeat after me.

08:32.102 --> 08:33.102
Let's see.

08:41.152 --> 08:42.486
You, the next boy.

08:43.072 --> 08:44.448
What's your name?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.075
Salvador.

08:46.116 --> 08:48.785
A lovely name. Do you like singing?

08:48.828 --> 08:50.453
I don't know.

08:50.496 --> 08:51.789
But you like music, don't you?

08:51.830 --> 08:54.207
Yes, I like The Beatles and the cinema.

08:54.250 --> 08:58.754
Here we'll develop your tastes
and direct them to less pagan subjects.

08:59.338 --> 09:01.339
We'll do a vocalization test.

09:28.534 --> 09:30.619
We'll warm up those voices, boys.

09:31.495 --> 09:35.082
That was how I became
the soloist in the choir.

09:42.881 --> 09:46.843
The priests decided I wouldn't attend
geography and history classes

09:46.886 --> 09:49.012
or science or history of art.

09:50.389 --> 09:53.476
During the first three years
of high school,

09:53.516 --> 09:57.438
while those subjects were taught,
I was practicing,

09:57.479 --> 09:59.105
and I always passed the exams.

10:00.107 --> 10:02.443
They made me a total ignoramus

10:02.484 --> 10:06.196
who passed every subject
without doing the exams.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.122
GEOGRAPHY

10:16.207 --> 10:19.668
With time, I became a film director

10:19.709 --> 10:22.295
and I started to learn Spanish geography

10:22.338 --> 10:25.049
while traveling to promote
the films I directed.

10:25.089 --> 10:26.175
ROME

10:26.217 --> 10:27.968
I traveled because I was successful.

10:28.010 --> 10:28.886
LONDON

10:30.221 --> 10:31.806
My knowledge of geography...

10:31.847 --> 10:33.057
NEW YORK

10:33.098 --> 10:35.184
...coincided with my growth
as a filmmaker.

10:36.852 --> 10:38.978
ANATOMY

10:39.854 --> 10:41.898
I got to know my body

10:41.940 --> 10:44.442
through pain and illness.

10:45.486 --> 10:49.698
I lived my first 30 years
with relative abandon,

10:49.740 --> 10:54.078
but I soon discovered that my head
and what was inside it,

10:54.118 --> 10:57.497
as well as being
a source of pleasure and knowledge,

10:57.540 --> 11:00.876
also carried within it
infinite possibilities for pain.

11:03.045 --> 11:06.506
I soon became acquainted with insomnia,
chronic pharyngitis,

11:06.549 --> 11:11.345
otitis, reflux, ulcers
and intrinsic asthma.

11:13.097 --> 11:16.100
Nerves in general
and the sciatic in particular.

11:20.771 --> 11:23.064
And all kinds of muscular pain.

11:24.607 --> 11:29.487
Lumbar, dorsal,
tendinitis in both knees and shoulders.

11:34.868 --> 11:37.579
This is tinnitus.

11:37.621 --> 11:38.914
I have that too.

11:42.626 --> 11:45.838
These are wheezes or whistles.

11:45.880 --> 11:47.673
I also suffer from those.

11:51.176 --> 11:53.386
As well as tinnitus and wheezes,

11:53.429 --> 11:55.848
my speciality is headaches...

11:56.806 --> 11:59.809
migraines, tension headaches
or cluster headaches,

11:59.852 --> 12:01.145
and back pain.

12:01.936 --> 12:04.898
After the spinal fusion operation,

12:04.939 --> 12:07.484
which immobilized
more than half of my back,

12:07.525 --> 12:11.530
I discovered that my life would revolve
around my spinal column.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.992
I became aware of each one of my vertebrae

12:15.034 --> 12:17.495
and of the number of muscles and ligaments

12:17.535 --> 12:20.997
that make up the mythology
of our organism,

12:21.040 --> 12:23.083
and that, as with the Greek gods,

12:23.125 --> 12:27.004
our only way of relating
is through sacrifice.

12:33.260 --> 12:35.679
But not everything
is so physical and illustratable.

12:36.805 --> 12:39.724
I also suffer from abstract hardships,

12:39.766 --> 12:42.977
pains of the soul,
such as panic and anxiety,

12:43.020 --> 12:46.064
which add anguish and terror to my life.

12:46.106 --> 12:50.569
And naturally,
I've dealt for years with depression.

12:52.862 --> 12:55.657
On the nights when various pains coincide,

12:55.699 --> 12:59.245
that's when I believe in God
and I pray to him.

12:59.285 --> 13:01.997
The days when I only suffer
one kind of pain,

13:02.665 --> 13:04.415
I'm an atheist.

13:08.963 --> 13:10.381
It's here.

13:12.591 --> 13:15.928
- Very well. Keep the change.
- Thank you, sir.

13:24.477 --> 13:26.104
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye. Have a good day.

13:39.325 --> 13:40.952
Who is it?

13:40.995 --> 13:42.955
Alberto, it's Salvador.

13:43.914 --> 13:46.417
- Salvador who?
- Salvador Mallo.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.225
What are you doing here?

14:03.892 --> 14:05.351
I have to talk to you.

14:05.394 --> 14:07.730
- About what?
- About Sabor.

14:07.771 --> 14:09.397
Will you ask me in?

14:19.449 --> 14:21.410
Can I get you anything?

14:21.452 --> 14:22.912
Whatever you're having.

14:22.953 --> 14:25.289
- I was making some tea.
- That's fine.

14:26.372 --> 14:27.833
Look at that.

14:29.001 --> 14:31.337
I love that you've got Sabor here.

14:32.213 --> 14:33.756
Why have you come?

14:33.796 --> 14:37.175
It's taken me 32 years
to reconcile myself with this film.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.427
Thirty-two years.

14:41.096 --> 14:42.765
This is lovely!

14:42.806 --> 14:45.683
- What are those trees? Firs?
- Pines!

14:45.726 --> 14:49.438
Why the fuck have you come to see me
after 32 years?

14:50.439 --> 14:52.650
The Cinematheque has restored Sabor.

14:52.690 --> 14:54.819
They've decided it's a classic

14:54.859 --> 14:58.404
and they've programmed it
in a season of films shot in Madrid.

14:58.697 --> 15:01.116
They rang to ask me
if we'd present it together.

15:02.242 --> 15:05.328
Don't they know
we haven't spoken since then?

15:05.371 --> 15:07.957
If they do, they didn't mention it.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.251
Alberto,

15:11.293 --> 15:14.505
gossip grows old, like people.

15:14.546 --> 15:17.966
- Do you mind if we sit down?
- Go ahead.

15:18.007 --> 15:19.008
Thank you.

15:19.635 --> 15:22.596
Why do you want us
to present it together now?

15:24.723 --> 15:26.766
Because you didn't do it at the premiere.

15:26.809 --> 15:28.977
Because you forbade me, faggot!

15:29.019 --> 15:32.356
So it's only fair
that the two of us present it now.

15:47.954 --> 15:49.956
Who gave you my address?

15:50.748 --> 15:52.458
- Zulema.
- Oh.

15:53.835 --> 15:56.754
I met her by chance
and we talked about you.

15:59.757 --> 16:03.470
I'm going to chase the dragon.
If the sight disgusts you, you can leave.

16:03.511 --> 16:05.890
We can talk on the phone
about the Cinematheque.

16:08.766 --> 16:10.102
May I?

16:11.978 --> 16:13.771
I don't recognize you, Salvador.

16:17.025 --> 16:18.986
Is it your first time?

16:19.027 --> 16:20.778
Yes.

16:20.820 --> 16:24.074
And why do you want to try heroin
at this stage?

16:26.785 --> 16:28.203
Curiosity.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.249
I bet you're doing research for something.

16:58.442 --> 17:00.820
The drop!

17:22.714 --> 17:24.385
Salvador!

17:31.015 --> 17:32.058
Salva!

17:32.725 --> 17:33.726
Salva!

17:36.437 --> 17:38.398
Come and help me.

17:38.440 --> 17:40.317
Mom, I found a novel.

17:40.358 --> 17:41.901
Good. Leave it there.

17:41.944 --> 17:43.236
Take that.

17:43.279 --> 17:46.030
How was I to know it was a holiday here?

17:46.072 --> 17:48.032
It isn't a holiday in our village!

17:48.075 --> 17:49.410
I didn't know either.

17:50.869 --> 17:52.871
What a night we're going to have.

17:55.540 --> 17:56.958
The shame of it.

18:04.758 --> 18:06.844
Open the chocolate.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.303
Alright.

18:17.312 --> 18:19.314
There are two cards!

18:19.356 --> 18:22.401
Leave the cards for now.
We're going to eat.

18:22.443 --> 18:26.238
Liz Taylor and Robert Taylor.
Are they brother and sister?

18:26.280 --> 18:28.031
I guess so.

18:33.037 --> 18:34.579
Eat up.

18:35.371 --> 18:37.665
What a disgrace.

18:37.707 --> 18:39.292
Dumped here like gypsies.

18:41.169 --> 18:42.837
I like the station.

18:44.464 --> 18:46.382
You're a dreamer!

18:46.425 --> 18:48.051
I don't know who you took after.

18:48.092 --> 18:51.262
Wrap up well.
Don't get ill on top of everything.

18:55.059 --> 18:57.019
My God, what a huge hole!

18:57.811 --> 18:59.562
I didn't see it before.

19:01.190 --> 19:03.609
Give it to me. I'll sew it.

19:09.823 --> 19:11.783
Look, with the egg.

19:13.034 --> 19:15.203
Lie farther back and go to sleep.

19:15.995 --> 19:17.997
When your father was in the army,

19:19.207 --> 19:22.544
he learned to sew and darn
and to iron shirts.

19:22.586 --> 19:24.128
He did it very well.

19:27.424 --> 19:28.843
Will I go into the army?

19:30.802 --> 19:33.012
I guess you'll have to go.

19:33.597 --> 19:35.683
I don't want to!

19:35.723 --> 19:38.351
And I don't want you to go. It's useless.

19:38.394 --> 19:40.311
- Mom?
- What?

19:40.354 --> 19:44.732
Do you think Liz Taylor
sews Robert Taylor's socks?

19:46.068 --> 19:48.319
I don't know.

19:48.361 --> 19:52.740
From the photos,
she doesn't look as if she likes darning.

19:52.782 --> 19:54.367
Are you alright?

20:00.331 --> 20:02.001
Don't forget to breathe.

20:02.792 --> 20:03.877
No.

20:08.715 --> 20:13.261
God, what a long night!
I thought we'd never get here.

20:13.303 --> 20:16.014
I told you to wait until I got settled in.

20:16.056 --> 20:18.184
Your mother was fed up with us.

20:18.224 --> 20:19.976
Don't say that.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.271
You know what she said three days ago?

20:22.312 --> 20:24.732
"This month my bread bill
has gone up so much!"

20:24.772 --> 20:27.775
- Can you believe it!
- Ignore her. You know what she's like.

20:28.277 --> 20:30.237
I won't be a burden to anyone.

20:30.279 --> 20:32.740
That same day I packed our bags
and here we are.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.073
Salva!

20:34.116 --> 20:35.783
Come here.

20:35.826 --> 20:37.243
Or would you rather be alone?

20:37.286 --> 20:39.038
Jacinta, don't say that.

20:39.078 --> 20:41.080
But you could have waited a few days.

20:41.749 --> 20:43.334
Is it much farther?

20:43.375 --> 20:45.044
No.

20:46.337 --> 20:47.963
We're here.

20:48.588 --> 20:50.925
Is our house here?

20:50.965 --> 20:52.467
We're on top of it.

20:54.094 --> 20:55.304
What?

20:56.055 --> 20:57.306
On top of it.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.067
A cave!

21:08.107 --> 21:09.819
It's the best I found.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.155
For God's sake, a cave!

21:13.196 --> 21:14.531
Salva, come on, let's go.

21:17.283 --> 21:19.078
How can we live in a cave?

21:19.787 --> 21:24.040
There are over 300 families living
in caves. It's typical of this village.

21:24.082 --> 21:26.084
There's no shame in it.

21:26.126 --> 21:28.628
Is this our house, Dad?

21:28.671 --> 21:30.256
This is it, Son.

21:30.297 --> 21:31.298
Go in.

21:34.425 --> 21:35.552
A cave!

21:37.303 --> 21:38.973
For God's sake.

21:39.013 --> 21:41.724
It was your idea
to leave the village and come here.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.229
What would they say there if they saw us?

22:00.452 --> 22:03.955
I didn't have time to whitewash it.
That's why I wanted you to wait.

22:05.624 --> 22:10.129
It's all in a mess. We have to fix it up.

22:11.129 --> 22:12.922
Mom, look, the sky!

22:16.635 --> 22:17.970
Look!

22:55.715 --> 22:58.051
I cleaned it as well as I could.

22:58.092 --> 22:59.844
Are you happy we're here?

22:59.886 --> 23:01.888
I wanted something else for you.

23:02.973 --> 23:06.309
You think I'm happy
bringing you to a cave?

23:06.351 --> 23:07.936
There was nothing else.

23:07.978 --> 23:11.190
It's alright.
I'll make it look like a home.

23:11.232 --> 23:12.982
Come on.

23:13.024 --> 23:14.819
But your mother, really,

23:14.859 --> 23:17.195
saying that about the bread
in front of him.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.324
He loves it.

23:23.202 --> 23:26.872
I don't want to see you so serious.
It makes you look ugly.

23:26.914 --> 23:29.583
Dad, can I start sweeping?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.919
I need a taxi to collect me.

23:32.794 --> 23:35.171
Just a minute.

23:35.213 --> 23:38.425
- What's the address?
- Calle Pontón, 89.

23:38.466 --> 23:42.595
Uh, Calle Pontón, 89.
In San Lorenzo de El Escorial.

23:43.597 --> 23:47.518
To go to Paseo del Pintor Rosales, 108.

23:48.394 --> 23:49.728
That's right.

23:49.770 --> 23:51.312
Yes, in Madrid.

23:52.106 --> 23:53.190
Very well.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.233
Fifteen minutes. Thank you.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.739
So you're clear about the Cinematheque?

24:01.781 --> 24:03.324
The 18th.

24:03.367 --> 24:04.451
In three weeks.

24:04.492 --> 24:06.619
I'm even planning my outfit.

24:06.662 --> 24:08.789
But we'll talk before that, right?

24:11.332 --> 24:12.917
Well.

24:12.960 --> 24:14.211
What's this?

24:14.252 --> 24:16.422
Can't we exchange two kisses
like old friends?

24:16.463 --> 24:18.257
We've even smoked the peace dragon.

24:19.675 --> 24:21.385
Alright.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.481
Afternoon.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.828
Miss Mercedes rang.
Call her as soon as you can.

24:56.002 --> 24:57.295
Hello?

24:57.338 --> 24:59.005
It's me.

24:59.048 --> 25:01.634
Salvador, is it true
about the Cinematheque?

25:01.675 --> 25:03.260
Yes.

25:03.301 --> 25:05.721
Keep me informed.
Don't shut me out so much.

25:06.430 --> 25:08.349
I was going to tell you.

25:08.389 --> 25:11.267
I'm delighted they're showing Sabor
and that you're appearing.

25:11.309 --> 25:14.521
But do you really want a Q&A?
The place will be full.

25:14.562 --> 25:16.357
It isn't that I want a Q&A.

25:16.397 --> 25:19.901
I'm just curious to see
if the film has survived these 30 years.

25:19.944 --> 25:21.110
You'd better believe it.

25:21.153 --> 25:24.323
But if you decide not to go,
tell me and I'll sort it out.

25:24.365 --> 25:26.450
Better to cancel now
than at the last minute.

25:26.492 --> 25:27.992
Alright. Bye.

25:30.453 --> 25:32.956
I'm leaving now. Do you need anything?

25:32.998 --> 25:34.792
No, thank you, Maya.

25:34.834 --> 25:36.460
See you tomorrow.

25:37.252 --> 25:40.004
He was the loneliest man
Death had ever seen.

25:41.130 --> 25:43.550
I entered the room where Johannes was.

25:44.342 --> 25:46.845
He had rolled over into a ball,

25:46.886 --> 25:49.389
so there was no room for me.

25:49.431 --> 25:53.686
When I tried to make a space for myself,
he woke and we made love,

25:54.686 --> 25:56.229
but loneliness stayed with me

25:56.271 --> 25:59.191
and I couldn't expel it from my heart.

25:59.232 --> 26:02.778
We were as close as two people could be,

26:02.819 --> 26:04.362
but each in his own world.

26:38.062 --> 26:39.689
Hello.

26:39.732 --> 26:41.608
Weren't you going to answer?

26:41.649 --> 26:43.944
I wasn't expecting anyone
and I've got a headache.

26:43.985 --> 26:46.446
- If you want, I'll go.
- No, you're here now.

26:53.828 --> 26:58.541
- And do you live like this, in darkness?
- When I've got a headache, yes.

26:58.584 --> 26:59.710
Poor thing!

26:59.751 --> 27:01.628
You've got one hell of a house!

27:03.213 --> 27:04.339
You want anything?

27:05.465 --> 27:06.675
Any liquor.

27:09.052 --> 27:10.303
This is wonderful!

27:19.312 --> 27:21.523
What?

27:23.233 --> 27:25.194
Breathe through your nose.

27:25.235 --> 27:26.486
Through your nose.

27:26.529 --> 27:28.030
Wait, water...

27:28.446 --> 27:29.697
Take it easy.

27:30.825 --> 27:31.867
Wait.

27:31.908 --> 27:32.909
Breathe.

27:33.868 --> 27:34.953
Drink.

27:36.163 --> 27:39.333
Be careful, drink slowly.

27:47.007 --> 27:49.051
Shit, I choke on nothing!

27:54.056 --> 27:55.933
I thought you were dying!

27:58.894 --> 28:00.436
I'm fine.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.023
It happens from time to time
and it's horrible.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.935
SIRENS

30:04.686 --> 30:07.106
TOO MANY CHANGES

30:07.522 --> 30:09.817
STRANGE WAY OF LIFE

30:11.484 --> 30:13.404
ADDICTION

30:30.087 --> 30:31.588
My idea of cinema

30:31.629 --> 30:34.675
was always linked
to the breeze on summer nights.

30:34.716 --> 30:36.886
We only saw films in the summer.

30:38.721 --> 30:42.641
The films were projected
on an enormous wall

30:42.683 --> 30:44.393
that had been whitewashed.

30:45.769 --> 30:49.356
I particularly remember
the films where there was water:

30:49.397 --> 30:52.775
waterfalls, beaches,

30:52.818 --> 30:56.655
the bottom of the sea, rivers or springs.

30:56.696 --> 30:59.532
Just hearing the sound of water

30:59.575 --> 31:02.244
gave all the kids
a tremendous desire to urinate

31:02.286 --> 31:05.039
and we did it right there,
on both sides of the screen.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.043
In the cinema of my childhood,
it always smells of piss,

31:11.669 --> 31:14.005
and of jasmine,

31:14.048 --> 31:15.174
and of the summer breeze.

31:31.147 --> 31:32.690
What are you doing there?

31:34.443 --> 31:35.694
Reading you.

31:36.779 --> 31:38.739
I've just read Addiction.

31:38.780 --> 31:40.281
You shouldn't have.

31:40.323 --> 31:43.243
I had to do something. You were groggy.

31:44.912 --> 31:46.329
May I?

31:47.956 --> 31:49.165
Yes.

31:50.835 --> 31:52.419
Delicious!

31:54.128 --> 31:56.924
Hey, the short story knocked me out.

31:56.965 --> 32:00.176
- It isn't a short story.
- Well, whatever it is.

32:01.095 --> 32:03.514
It could be staged just as it is.

32:03.556 --> 32:05.723
Thanks, but it isn't a dramatic text.

32:05.765 --> 32:07.225
It doesn't matter.

32:07.268 --> 32:10.563
I could perform it,
I really know what it's talking about.

32:10.604 --> 32:11.939
You?

32:11.981 --> 32:14.400
You're on the opposite side of that text.

32:16.152 --> 32:18.444
You forget that I'm an actor

32:18.486 --> 32:20.071
and I suffer very well.

32:23.242 --> 32:25.786
I need to act again.

32:27.788 --> 32:29.957
I came down from my pedestal
a long time ago.

32:31.625 --> 32:34.461
I'm in touch with the Sala Mirador.

32:34.502 --> 32:37.088
I know it's a very small theater,
very "off,"

32:38.089 --> 32:39.841
to put on Le bel indifférent, by Cocteau.

32:40.467 --> 32:41.509
Hmm.

32:41.551 --> 32:44.012
With men, to give it that touch.

32:44.053 --> 32:46.848
But to be honest,
I'd much rather do your text.

32:46.890 --> 32:48.558
Why not give me a copy and I'll show them.

32:48.600 --> 32:50.101
Alberto, stop!

32:50.144 --> 32:51.811
I don't understand. Why did you write it?

32:51.854 --> 32:55.357
To forget about the content.
But I don't want to talk about it.

32:57.776 --> 33:00.863
Will you let me have
what's left of the paper?

33:00.905 --> 33:02.990
I'm not a dealer.

33:04.073 --> 33:06.075
I'll give it to you,

33:06.117 --> 33:08.244
but use it with discretion.

33:08.287 --> 33:10.623
These late discoveries are the worst

33:10.664 --> 33:12.249
and you're far too keen.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.378
Think about what I said about the Mirador.

33:16.419 --> 33:17.962
Yes.

33:19.548 --> 33:21.509
Did it get rid of your headache?

33:21.550 --> 33:23.511
- Totally.
- You see?

33:51.246 --> 33:53.289
- Is he on his way?
- I don't know.

33:53.331 --> 33:55.376
You organized all this yourself.

33:55.416 --> 33:58.462
I don't understand.
He loved the restored print.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.505
- The washroom?
- On your left.

34:01.589 --> 34:02.800
Why don't you call him?

34:02.841 --> 34:04.467
Excuse me, is there a Q&A?

34:04.510 --> 34:07.096
Yes, the director is on his way.

34:07.137 --> 34:08.222
All right.

34:15.521 --> 34:17.147
The Cinematheque.

34:18.649 --> 34:20.442
Give it to me.

34:23.235 --> 34:24.946
I don't believe it!

34:24.987 --> 34:27.239
You organize all this
and then you don't go!

34:28.367 --> 34:31.202
It took a lot of work
to borrow this jacket.

34:31.870 --> 34:33.705
- You go.
- Eh?

34:34.998 --> 34:38.333
- On my own?
- I don't want to be seen like this!

34:38.377 --> 34:39.503
Seen how?

34:39.543 --> 34:42.380
It isn't a beauty contest,
it's a fucking Q&A!

34:42.422 --> 34:44.925
I don't want to be seen
drugged up and stammering.

34:46.176 --> 34:49.888
When you step on stage,
you'll control the situation.

34:49.929 --> 34:51.306
With what you've been...

34:51.347 --> 34:54.893
That was before,
and without having taken heroin.

35:01.734 --> 35:03.068
Salvador? Where are you?

35:03.109 --> 35:04.611
At home.

35:04.653 --> 35:05.779
Still?

35:05.821 --> 35:07.990
The film's over.
The audience is waiting for you.

35:08.031 --> 35:09.033
Really?

35:12.785 --> 35:14.621
I'm with Salvador Mallo.

35:16.372 --> 35:19.042
We were intending to go.

35:19.084 --> 35:20.961
Alberto Crespo is with me.

35:21.002 --> 35:23.254
And the lead, Alberto Crespo.

35:23.296 --> 35:25.507
Would you mind applauding again,
so they can hear it?

35:25.548 --> 35:27.091
It might encourage them.

35:39.229 --> 35:41.564
- Is everyone listening to me?
- Yes.

35:42.691 --> 35:46.361
Well, I'd like to apologize
to the spectators.

35:46.403 --> 35:50.031
At the last minute I wasn't feeling well.

35:51.283 --> 35:52.952
I'm with Alberto Crespo.

35:53.827 --> 35:55.620
He stayed to keep me company.

35:55.662 --> 35:56.996
Excuse me.

35:57.039 --> 36:00.292
Someone's raising their hand.
I think there's a question.

36:00.334 --> 36:02.752
It's a question for the director.

36:04.046 --> 36:05.839
Mr. Mallo, what do you think

36:05.881 --> 36:08.801
of Alberto Crespo's
performance in the film?

36:08.843 --> 36:12.596
Some people say you weren't happy
and that's why you grew apart.

36:17.475 --> 36:19.060
Did you hear the question?

36:20.521 --> 36:22.856
Yes, I heard it.

36:22.897 --> 36:26.526
I read that after Sabor you argued

36:26.568 --> 36:28.278
and didn't see each other again.

36:29.488 --> 36:32.366
Look, time is mysterious.

36:32.408 --> 36:35.202
I saw the film again a month ago,

36:35.243 --> 36:38.914
and I think Alberto's performance
has gained a lot with time.

36:41.457 --> 36:44.211
What did you not like about it?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.506
Its heaviness,

36:49.091 --> 36:50.509
its lethal rhythm.

36:51.635 --> 36:53.761
I conceived a dynamic character,

36:53.803 --> 36:56.182
a funny, scathing cocaine addict.

36:56.222 --> 36:59.184
Alberto didn't have the lightness
I asked him for,

36:59.225 --> 37:00.560
not because he was incapable,

37:00.602 --> 37:04.189
but because he was taking
the opposite drug, heroin.

37:04.231 --> 37:07.651
The rhythm of his performance was graver,

37:07.693 --> 37:10.321
the humor in the text disappeared.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.905
But I must be fair.

37:11.946 --> 37:16.493
Now I think that the gravity he brought
goes well with the character.

37:17.452 --> 37:19.120
It gives him substance.

37:21.789 --> 37:23.833
How dare you!

37:23.876 --> 37:26.127
I didn't mean to say it,
but now it's said.

37:27.629 --> 37:28.796
Be careful with me!

37:30.508 --> 37:32.676
I won't let you humiliate me again!

37:34.178 --> 37:37.807
- Who the fuck do you think you are?
- I just told the truth.

37:37.847 --> 37:40.725
You promised you wouldn't take heroin
during the shoot.

37:40.767 --> 37:42.936
That's why I gave you the part
and you lied to me!

37:42.977 --> 37:46.064
You did what you wanted!
I had to tell you some day!

37:52.238 --> 37:53.823
You're fucking crazy.

39:05.935 --> 39:07.437
I give him all the messages.

39:09.731 --> 39:12.650
He's been avoiding me lately.
Is he really alright?

39:13.151 --> 39:15.778
He doesn't eat much, and he chokes a lot.

39:17.238 --> 39:18.865
Puree all his food.

39:20.618 --> 39:23.162
- Does he go out?
- Not that I see.

39:23.203 --> 39:26.539
But he walks through the house,
along the hallway.

39:27.832 --> 39:30.961
I saw loafers by the door
and he never liked them.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.254
He wears them,

39:32.296 --> 39:34.506
even though he's got
a thousand lovely sneakers.

39:34.548 --> 39:35.841
Maya.

39:35.883 --> 39:39.178
Tell him you don't mind
doing up his shoes for him.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.515
It must be very hard for him
to tie the laces.

39:42.555 --> 39:45.767
I do tell him, but he doesn't want me to.

39:45.810 --> 39:47.311
I think he's embarrassed.

39:47.352 --> 39:50.021
I feel sorry for him.
I don't know what to do.

39:50.897 --> 39:53.691
Smile at him, and take good care of him.

39:55.109 --> 39:57.278
If you see anything strange, call me.

39:58.280 --> 40:00.573
Everything here is strange.

40:02.618 --> 40:03.661
I know...

40:11.584 --> 40:13.586
SISTER
I BELIEVE YOU

40:41.573 --> 40:43.242
Can I help you with anything?

40:44.450 --> 40:45.660
I don't know.

40:46.578 --> 40:47.705
What do you want?

40:49.455 --> 40:50.540
A dose.

40:53.836 --> 40:54.919
Ten euros.

40:56.839 --> 40:58.591
- 10 Euros?
- Yes.

40:58.631 --> 41:02.470
Don't bring me shit.
If it's good, I'll come back.

41:02.510 --> 41:04.554
- Give me the money.
- No, no, no.

41:04.597 --> 41:06.223
When you bring the material.

41:06.265 --> 41:07.641
In cash and now.

41:15.274 --> 41:16.357
Wait here.

41:35.044 --> 41:38.047
Come here. Damn it!

41:41.801 --> 41:43.969
Come back here!

42:09.160 --> 42:11.412
He's so young
and look at how he's reading!

42:12.832 --> 42:13.915
Hey...

42:14.874 --> 42:17.377
- Can you write too?
- Yes.

42:17.419 --> 42:21.382
How much would you charge
to write a letter to my aunt in Bilbao?

42:21.423 --> 42:23.341
I don't know.

42:23.383 --> 42:24.425
What's this?

42:25.803 --> 42:29.013
We wanted your son
to write a letter for us.

42:29.055 --> 42:31.141
My boyfriend is illiterate.

42:31.182 --> 42:33.768
When can I learn if I'm working all day?

42:33.810 --> 42:36.104
If you didn't waste your time drawing...

42:36.147 --> 42:38.357
- Are you a builder?
- And a painter.

42:39.024 --> 42:41.902
What a pity! So handsome and illiterate!

42:43.069 --> 42:45.405
My Salvador can teach you
to read and write.

42:45.865 --> 42:46.866
Can't you?

42:48.408 --> 42:50.535
At night, when you finish work.

42:51.370 --> 42:53.122
Whenever it suits you.

42:54.372 --> 42:56.666
Could you teach me math too?

42:56.709 --> 42:57.877
Yes.

42:57.917 --> 43:01.088
Of course, the four rules
so no one can cheat you.

43:01.129 --> 43:04.175
In the world we live in
you can't be illiterate.

43:05.885 --> 43:08.386
I'll get paper and a pencil
to write the letter.

43:09.388 --> 43:12.600
- How much would you charge?
- Nothing!

43:12.640 --> 43:14.100
But as you're a builder,

43:14.142 --> 43:18.354
you could help me finish the kitchen
and paint the walls a bit.

43:18.397 --> 43:20.107
When it suits you.

43:20.149 --> 43:23.109
- It can only be Sunday.
- Sundays, that's great.

43:23.151 --> 43:26.988
And my Salvador will teach you
to read, to write, the four rules,

43:27.031 --> 43:28.908
and today's letter is free.

43:28.948 --> 43:29.950
Thank you.

43:32.035 --> 43:37.040
A, B, C, CH, D...

43:37.082 --> 43:39.667
Eduardo, when will you put in the sink?

43:39.709 --> 43:41.336
I have to wash all this in buckets.

43:42.296 --> 43:44.548
I wanted to finish the walls first.

43:44.589 --> 43:46.508
The sink is more urgent.

43:47.510 --> 43:49.345
I've got used to the paint coming off.

43:50.930 --> 43:54.809
Salvador gives me a lot of homework
and I don't have time.

43:54.850 --> 43:56.060
Salvador!

43:56.100 --> 43:58.646
If he wants to read and write,

43:58.687 --> 44:00.606
he has to learn the alphabet by heart.

44:01.689 --> 44:03.775
Come on. Start again.

44:05.151 --> 44:08.696
A, B, C,

44:09.448 --> 44:12.701
CH, F, J...

44:12.743 --> 44:14.453
No, Eduardo.

44:14.495 --> 44:16.789
It's F, G,

44:16.830 --> 44:18.915
H, I, J, K.

44:18.957 --> 44:20.459
You said it right before.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.794
There's a lot of letters.

44:22.836 --> 44:24.838
Stop complaining. That's what there is.

44:26.089 --> 44:29.260
No, you don't hold it like that.
Give me the pencil.

44:30.970 --> 44:33.305
Look, you hold it like this.

44:33.347 --> 44:35.182
Now you do it.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.935
- Like this.
- Yes, like that.

44:43.816 --> 44:47.111
No, you don't have to hold it so tight.

44:47.153 --> 44:49.821
Let your hand go loose.
I'll move it for you.

44:52.908 --> 44:54.660
"U."

44:57.537 --> 44:59.205
I'm a bit nervous.

44:59.247 --> 45:02.376
That's alright.
It's much better like this.

45:02.417 --> 45:04.836
- Do you like drawing?
- A lot.

45:04.879 --> 45:07.214
Then you'll learn to write very soon.

45:07.256 --> 45:09.884
Writing is like drawing, but with letters.

45:10.801 --> 45:12.511
Now do it on your own.

45:18.684 --> 45:20.685
"U." "U."

45:22.312 --> 45:23.646
That's it.

45:25.064 --> 45:27.193
Read the sentence.

45:27.234 --> 45:28.903
One...

45:29.944 --> 45:31.321
Holy...

45:32.698 --> 45:37.077
Catholic...

45:38.787 --> 45:45.252
Apos... tolic.

45:46.629 --> 45:49.298
One Holy Catholic Apostolic.

45:51.801 --> 45:53.886
Who's that?

45:53.928 --> 45:56.597
Spain. Who else could it be!

45:58.140 --> 45:59.767
Now write it all at once.

46:05.481 --> 46:08.566
Very good.
You're doing it more quickly now.

46:10.568 --> 46:12.153
There's a pile of invitations.

46:13.280 --> 46:15.073
You should go out somewhere.

46:16.283 --> 46:19.203
- Cecil Beaton. I'd love it.
- I'll go with you.

46:19.245 --> 46:20.996
The dance season has started.

46:21.037 --> 46:25.041
Dimitris Papaioannou and Jan Fabre
are coming to the Canal Theaters.

46:25.084 --> 46:28.671
The seats in theaters
are the most uncomfortable for me,

46:28.711 --> 46:30.922
and I don't want to leave in the middle.

46:34.468 --> 46:36.220
Did you go to see Dr. Galindo?

46:37.053 --> 46:38.805
No.

46:38.847 --> 46:40.473
I'm sick of doctors.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.018
How do you get the oxycodone?

46:45.479 --> 46:48.524
A friend gets it for me.
His mother's a pharmacist.

46:53.153 --> 46:54.780
This book came for you.

46:58.325 --> 47:00.578
How to Put an End to Counterculture.

47:00.618 --> 47:01.620
Christ knows.

47:03.789 --> 47:06.584
The Guggenheim have asked
for two of the Pérez Villaltas,

47:06.624 --> 47:07.917
for a retrospective.

47:07.959 --> 47:09.336
Tell them no.

47:09.377 --> 47:13.131
Those paintings are my only company.
I live with them.

47:17.803 --> 47:18.888
Sorry.

47:23.475 --> 47:24.559
Hello.

47:25.644 --> 47:26.645
Go on.

47:28.439 --> 47:29.522
Yes.

48:12.899 --> 48:14.693
I'm listening.

48:18.238 --> 48:20.907
I have to hang up. I can't keep talking.

48:26.247 --> 48:28.249
It's none of your business where I am!

48:34.796 --> 48:35.880
Anything wrong?

48:36.631 --> 48:38.300
No.

48:38.341 --> 48:40.510
Luis and I are getting a divorce.

48:41.428 --> 48:43.055
I didn't know you had problems.

48:44.347 --> 48:45.849
I didn't want to bother you.

48:46.934 --> 48:48.852
It's been going on for a while.

48:50.271 --> 48:53.731
And now that I'm at home so much,
I can't keep fooling myself.

48:55.484 --> 48:57.111
I'm sorry.

48:57.153 --> 48:58.736
So, if you don't mind,

49:00.156 --> 49:02.741
I'd like to keep taking care of your mail.

49:02.783 --> 49:04.910
People like to get an answer.

49:04.952 --> 49:07.162
But it's always no.

49:07.203 --> 49:08.955
You should do something.

49:08.997 --> 49:12.126
You've got too much free time
to think about your ailments.

49:12.167 --> 49:14.336
Give your brain
something to keep it occupied.

49:14.377 --> 49:16.588
I'd like to do things too, but...

49:20.676 --> 49:22.761
You could write.

49:22.803 --> 49:26.056
You've got loads of documents
full of ideas to develop.

49:26.097 --> 49:27.140
I'll make a list.

49:27.182 --> 49:29.642
I don't want to write
if afterwards I can't film it.

49:29.685 --> 49:33.147
And you know better than anyone
that I can't film in this condition.

49:36.316 --> 49:38.401
Without filming my life is meaningless.

49:40.905 --> 49:42.781
But that's how things are.

49:45.158 --> 49:46.535
Call me.

49:46.577 --> 49:48.495
For whatever you need.

50:03.968 --> 50:07.180
Jacinta, the cave looks beautiful.

50:08.265 --> 50:10.643
And that light!

50:11.894 --> 50:12.895
It rains at times.

50:14.729 --> 50:16.648
You can't be so selfish.

50:17.399 --> 50:18.442
We need the rain.

50:18.484 --> 50:21.194
Think of the countryside, the farmers.

50:21.236 --> 50:22.320
That's true.

50:22.363 --> 50:23.446
Of course.

50:26.242 --> 50:28.327
Well, let's see.

50:29.035 --> 50:30.829
Since your mother told me
that at the age of nine

50:30.870 --> 50:33.039
you were a teacher, I thought:

50:33.082 --> 50:34.792
That boy must be for God!

50:34.834 --> 50:36.627
He's always been ahead of boys his age.

50:37.586 --> 50:39.796
- Do you like teaching?
- Yes.

50:39.839 --> 50:41.465
Would you like to study?

50:41.506 --> 50:42.550
A lot.

50:42.591 --> 50:44.009
Why?

50:44.051 --> 50:47.847
To know more and to be able
to teach more things.

50:49.347 --> 50:50.431
Very good.

50:52.184 --> 50:55.019
That's what I call a vocation.

50:55.062 --> 50:57.314
I'll speak to Fr. José María
and he'll see to everything.

50:57.356 --> 50:58.357
Thank you.

51:00.276 --> 51:04.405
Next year you'll enter a seminary to study
for your high school diploma.

51:05.990 --> 51:09.118
You'll have to behave.
Not everyone gets a scholarship.

51:09.160 --> 51:12.413
- So is the scholarship definite?
- Yes, it is.

51:12.453 --> 51:13.997
Don't worry.

51:14.039 --> 51:16.207
And you, don't show me up.

51:16.249 --> 51:18.376
Think you're one of the chosen.

51:19.961 --> 51:23.548
Well, I still have a few visits to make.

51:23.591 --> 51:25.301
You don't want some more juice?

51:25.341 --> 51:27.302
No, thank you, it was delicious.

51:27.343 --> 51:28.678
Bye, Salvador.

51:29.638 --> 51:31.932
The walls look lovely with the whitewash.

51:31.973 --> 51:34.350
Yes, they're better.

51:34.392 --> 51:36.603
To tell you the truth, I really envy you.

51:36.644 --> 51:37.937
Me?

51:37.979 --> 51:41.191
Yes, you live in catacombs,
like the ancient Christians.

51:41.232 --> 51:42.943
Yes, that's how we live.

51:44.361 --> 51:46.071
Shall I come and sew on Sunday?

51:46.113 --> 51:48.365
Yes, I'll expect you.

51:48.406 --> 51:50.200
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:56.039 --> 51:57.749
- Mom.
- What, my love?

51:57.790 --> 52:00.044
Is a seminary a place to become a priest?

52:01.211 --> 52:02.295
Yes.

52:03.756 --> 52:06.509
Shall I make one
of those potato omelets you like?

52:06.550 --> 52:07.635
Sweetheart!

52:08.301 --> 52:09.678
I don't want to be a priest!

52:11.680 --> 52:15.225
- You don't have to be one.
- Then why send me to a seminary?

52:15.725 --> 52:18.604
Because for the poor
that's the only way to study!

52:18.646 --> 52:19.729
That's why.

52:20.647 --> 52:21.941
What can I do?

52:27.696 --> 52:29.448
Salvador!

52:30.698 --> 52:31.742
Salvador!

52:34.495 --> 52:35.788
Salvador!

52:43.127 --> 52:44.129
That child!

52:47.006 --> 52:48.550
Salvador!

52:48.591 --> 52:49.676
Come down!

52:51.095 --> 52:53.305
- Come down!
- I don't want to go to the seminary!

52:55.140 --> 52:57.559
When you get your diploma, you can leave.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.854
We'll think of a way
for you to have a career,

53:00.896 --> 53:02.814
so you don't end up like your father.

53:04.107 --> 53:06.234
I don't want to go to school!
I want to stay here!

53:06.276 --> 53:09.696
And what will you do here?

53:09.738 --> 53:12.491
Kill yourself working in the fields
or on building sites?

53:12.533 --> 53:13.659
Is that what you want?

53:14.493 --> 53:16.495
I don't want to be a priest!

53:18.997 --> 53:22.751
I find life distasteful,
like a useless medicine.

53:22.792 --> 53:26.088
And that's when I feel
and can clearly picture

53:26.129 --> 53:29.090
how easy it would be
to get rid of this tedium,

53:29.133 --> 53:32.386
if I had the simple strength of will
to really want to get rid of it.

53:42.897 --> 53:45.065
- Who is it?
- It's me.

53:46.024 --> 53:47.026
Go away!

53:54.450 --> 53:56.577
Go away or I'll call the police.

53:56.618 --> 53:58.828
I'm here to negotiate.

53:58.870 --> 54:01.122
I'll give you the rights
to perform Addiction.

54:01.164 --> 54:03.208
I don't believe you. Go away.

54:03.249 --> 54:04.501
- I'm busy.
- Really.

54:05.294 --> 54:07.171
I've got a copy of the text.

54:07.213 --> 54:08.214
Please, let me in.

54:11.341 --> 54:15.053
If it's a trick,
you'll leave worse than you are now.

54:22.352 --> 54:24.354
What's up? Are you on hunger strike?

54:26.064 --> 54:28.983
Are you still thinking
of doing Cocteau in the Mirador?

54:30.068 --> 54:31.069
Yes.

54:32.153 --> 54:33.655
But I've got lots of doubts.

54:33.696 --> 54:36.992
The text is beautiful,
but it's become outdated.

54:38.910 --> 54:42.205
If you really give me Addiction,
I'll go full out on it.

54:42.247 --> 54:44.582
I'd have to tell them at the Mirador.

54:46.627 --> 54:47.837
Here it is.

54:49.546 --> 54:51.048
Why this change of heart?

54:51.089 --> 54:53.383
I revised the text, like you said, and...

54:55.343 --> 54:56.803
First make me some tea.

54:57.930 --> 54:58.973
Of course.

55:01.684 --> 55:03.435
Anything else?

55:03.477 --> 55:05.896
I don't want to be credited.
Don't say it's mine.

55:05.937 --> 55:07.772
I don't want to appear anywhere.

55:07.814 --> 55:09.441
Very well. Will you direct me?

55:10.568 --> 55:11.694
No.

55:11.734 --> 55:13.278
- That would help.
- No, no.

55:13.319 --> 55:17.950
Let the people at the theater read it
and decide if they're interested.

55:17.992 --> 55:20.077
But don't give my name.

55:20.118 --> 55:22.287
- So who's the author?
- You.

55:23.497 --> 55:26.125
- Or we'll invent a pseudonym.
- No, no!

55:26.167 --> 55:27.877
I'll sign it!

55:28.459 --> 55:29.461
But I don't understand.

55:31.629 --> 55:33.298
It's a confessional text.

55:35.050 --> 55:37.385
- I don't want to be identified.
- I see.

55:40.222 --> 55:44.100
Uh, about the staging,

55:44.142 --> 55:46.019
I suggest an empty stage,

55:46.979 --> 55:48.189
a screen.

55:48.229 --> 55:49.647
A chair,

55:49.689 --> 55:52.108
if you don't know what to do
with your arms and hands.

55:52.151 --> 55:54.986
I know exactly what to do
with my arms and hands.

55:55.028 --> 55:56.571
After correcting it,

55:56.613 --> 55:59.324
I admit that the text
is a bit melodramatic now.

55:59.365 --> 56:02.744
Don't worry. I master melodrama.

56:02.785 --> 56:04.871
My years in Mexico will be of some use.

56:04.914 --> 56:07.999
That's why I'm telling you.
You have to avoid sentimentality.

56:08.042 --> 56:12.796
Control the emotion. Don't cry.
Actors take any opportunity to cry.

56:12.838 --> 56:14.839
The better actor isn't the one who cries,

56:14.881 --> 56:17.717
it's the one who fights
to hold back his tears.

56:17.760 --> 56:19.428
Let me give you a kiss, honey.

56:25.517 --> 56:29.146
If you don't mind,
I'm going to start working now.

56:29.187 --> 56:31.481
Stay if you want, make yourself at home.

56:31.524 --> 56:34.026
I've got a lot of magazines from the '80s.

56:34.068 --> 56:37.363
You're in some of them,
dressed as a woman.

56:38.488 --> 56:41.242
You soon forgot those times.

56:41.283 --> 56:44.745
But first offer me some,
and give me your dealer's address.

56:44.787 --> 56:47.289
Tell him I'll go myself to pick it up.

56:48.082 --> 56:51.126
There's no need!
They deliver it now, like Telepizza.

56:54.504 --> 56:55.588
Lighter.

57:10.104 --> 57:11.480
Here.

57:12.564 --> 57:14.482
Not yet.

57:14.524 --> 57:16.443
Why?

57:16.484 --> 57:19.863
I'm reducing the doses,
just enough so I can work.

57:19.905 --> 57:21.156
And can you do it?

57:23.700 --> 57:24.993
How do you think I'm still here?

57:26.662 --> 57:28.038
Going in and out.

57:30.874 --> 57:32.292
It's slavery.

57:33.877 --> 57:35.963
But this play is vital for me,

57:37.423 --> 57:40.008
and I have to be
as clean as I can to do it.

57:41.510 --> 57:44.513
I don't want to lose one iota

57:44.555 --> 57:47.265
of the emotion
you've put into these pages.

57:52.979 --> 57:54.272
Will you come to see me?

57:54.314 --> 57:56.941
I don't know. I don't think so.

57:56.984 --> 57:58.694
This time I'm not doing Shakespeare,

57:59.861 --> 58:02.071
or Chekhov, or Lorca.

58:02.948 --> 58:04.325
I'm doing you.

58:05.367 --> 58:07.995
If you do it badly, I'll feel terrible.

58:09.078 --> 58:12.374
And if you do it well,
I'll feel much worse.

58:18.796 --> 58:20.423
"The cinema of my childhood...

58:21.508 --> 58:22.842
always smells of piss."

58:23.676 --> 58:24.761
And of jasmine.

58:25.720 --> 58:27.305
And of the summer breeze.

59:16.689 --> 59:19.357
I met Marcelo in a washroom
full of people.

59:23.278 --> 59:24.655
It wasn't the first time I'd seen him,

59:27.031 --> 59:28.033
but it was that night,

59:29.827 --> 59:31.745
after casually brushing
against each other,

59:33.205 --> 59:35.540
when I discovered that I liked that boy.

59:37.417 --> 59:40.503
We spent the whole weekend in bed.

59:40.546 --> 59:42.756
And before I knew it, a year had passed...

59:43.966 --> 59:46.385
and we could no longer
live without each other.

59:48.888 --> 59:50.931
It was 1981,

59:52.850 --> 59:53.976
and Madrid was ours.

59:57.396 --> 01:00:00.566
One day I found Marcelo
looking paler than usual.

01:00:02.484 --> 01:00:04.111
He'd been losing weight...

01:00:05.613 --> 01:00:07.031
and he looked haggard.

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:15.205
I asked him if he wasn't feeling well...

01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:20.418
and he confessed that he'd started
fooling around with heroin.

01:00:22.588 --> 01:00:25.381
I was surprised
because I'd never taken it.

01:00:25.423 --> 01:00:28.802
I drank and I snorted cocaine
like everyone,

01:00:29.803 --> 01:00:32.055
but never heroin.

01:00:32.097 --> 01:00:35.142
I sensed that it wasn't good
and I didn't like it.

01:00:36.769 --> 01:00:39.522
I was going flat out,
I was writing a nighttime chronicle,

01:00:39.562 --> 01:00:41.564
I was appearing on musical shows,

01:00:41.606 --> 01:00:43.733
I was singing in a parody punk group,

01:00:43.776 --> 01:00:46.779
I was preparing my first film, I shot it,

01:00:46.821 --> 01:00:49.156
it was released, it was a success.

01:00:49.198 --> 01:00:51.242
I wrote the second, I shot it.

01:00:51.283 --> 01:00:53.493
I was doing a thousand things,
I wasn't sleeping,

01:00:53.535 --> 01:00:56.162
while Marcelo was languishing
on the couch at home...

01:00:57.580 --> 01:00:59.374
or shut away in the bathroom,

01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:02.752
or out of the house,
somewhere I didn't know.

01:01:06.381 --> 01:01:09.175
I spent the night coming and going
from the window to the bed,

01:01:10.510 --> 01:01:13.096
always listening
for the sound of the door.

01:01:13.138 --> 01:01:15.557
ACTING SCHOOL

01:01:15.598 --> 01:01:17.892
- Here are your tickets.
- Thank you.

01:01:18.977 --> 01:01:21.563
Madrid had become a difficult ring,

01:01:22.731 --> 01:01:24.274
as bullfighting people say,

01:01:25.901 --> 01:01:28.904
so we traveled continuously,

01:01:28.946 --> 01:01:31.240
anything so as to get out of Madrid.

01:01:33.158 --> 01:01:34.993
The first days were the worst.

01:01:36.495 --> 01:01:39.123
While Marcelo was going cold turkey,
I looked after him...

01:01:40.039 --> 01:01:41.082
and I wrote.

01:01:42.334 --> 01:01:46.004
I don't know how, but I wrote.

01:01:46.046 --> 01:01:48.716
Marcelo was very young,
the effects didn't last long,

01:01:48.756 --> 01:01:50.675
three or four days.

01:01:52.343 --> 01:01:55.513
Then we'd go out on the street
and have fun, like kids.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:01.227
I remember the Ivory Coast.

01:02:01.269 --> 01:02:04.814
Dozens of muscular young men,
washing clothes in the river,

01:02:05.524 --> 01:02:07.109
on wheel rims.

01:02:08.401 --> 01:02:09.861
The Malecón in Havana,

01:02:10.863 --> 01:02:12.823
by day or night.

01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:19.621
Old Havana, beating gently to the rhythm
of unceasing percussions.

01:02:23.209 --> 01:02:24.585
I remember Mexico City.

01:02:28.046 --> 01:02:29.380
Marcelo and I, drunk,

01:02:31.008 --> 01:02:34.886
listening to Chavela Vargas
singing "The Night of My Love."

01:02:34.928 --> 01:02:38.890
I want

01:02:38.932 --> 01:02:44.437
The joy of a ship
Returning

01:02:46.649 --> 01:02:51.362
A thousand bells of glory
Pealing

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.287
Those journeys,
which were only to escape from Madrid,

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.957
from heroin,

01:03:06.292 --> 01:03:08.336
became my best school.

01:03:10.089 --> 01:03:12.132
On those journeys,
I found the inspiration...

01:03:13.591 --> 01:03:17.137
to write the stories
that I would tell years later

01:03:17.178 --> 01:03:19.597
and the colors that would illuminate them.

01:03:20.932 --> 01:03:23.268
But we couldn't spend our lives traveling.

01:03:24.727 --> 01:03:26.896
Sooner or later,
we had to go back to Madrid.

01:03:28.816 --> 01:03:31.734
And Madrid was a minefield, a dead end.

01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:36.198
I was desperate. I didn't know what to do.

01:03:38.408 --> 01:03:39.993
Except repeat myself.

01:03:41.412 --> 01:03:45.165
We both repeated ourselves
for three long years.

01:03:49.086 --> 01:03:52.006
I thought the strength of my love
would defeat his addiction.

01:03:52.881 --> 01:03:54.258
But it wasn't so.

01:03:56.635 --> 01:03:58.261
Love isn't enough.

01:04:00.263 --> 01:04:02.265
Maybe love can move mountains,

01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:07.687
but it isn't enough
to save the person you love.

01:04:27.165 --> 01:04:28.834
Under the whitewashed wall

01:04:28.876 --> 01:04:31.461
where the films of my childhood
were projected,

01:04:33.506 --> 01:04:36.383
I prayed that nothing would happen
to the leading ladies.

01:04:40.053 --> 01:04:41.597
But I didn't succeed,

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.184
neither with Natalie Wood
nor with Marilyn.

01:04:47.227 --> 01:04:49.687
Then I tried to save Marcelo
and to save myself.

01:04:53.609 --> 01:04:55.986
If Marcelo was saved,
it was far away from me.

01:04:59.113 --> 01:05:01.157
As for me, I stayed in Madrid...

01:05:04.118 --> 01:05:05.829
and the cinema saved me.

01:05:11.752 --> 01:05:14.088
CAT ON A HOT TIN ROOF

01:05:14.129 --> 01:05:15.297
Come in.

01:05:20.885 --> 01:05:21.970
Hello.

01:05:22.888 --> 01:05:24.098
Good evening.

01:05:25.057 --> 01:05:26.142
Good evening.

01:05:27.142 --> 01:05:28.184
Come in.

01:05:32.647 --> 01:05:33.649
Have we met?

01:05:34.566 --> 01:05:35.943
Yes.

01:05:38.486 --> 01:05:40.238
I don't remember you.

01:05:40.281 --> 01:05:45.161
It was a long time ago, when you were
preparing Sabor with Salvador Mallo.

01:05:46.495 --> 01:05:49.498
- I'm sorry, I don't remember.
- We met two or three times.

01:05:50.624 --> 01:05:52.084
I'm Federico,

01:05:52.126 --> 01:05:54.294
the Marcelo in your monologue.

01:05:58.423 --> 01:06:00.091
Did you like it?

01:06:00.133 --> 01:06:02.010
I don't know.

01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:05.513
"Like" isn't the word.
It affected me very much.

01:06:07.057 --> 01:06:10.310
- You were crying, weren't you?
- Yes, I guess.

01:06:11.812 --> 01:06:12.813
Sit down.

01:06:13.689 --> 01:06:15.774
I imagine you have some questions for me.

01:06:20.571 --> 01:06:21.947
Is Salvador alive?

01:06:32.457 --> 01:06:33.959
How did it go tonight?

01:06:34.001 --> 01:06:36.127
Very well. Full house.

01:06:36.794 --> 01:06:38.254
A pity the theater is so small.

01:06:38.296 --> 01:06:40.340
It's better. You gain in intimacy.

01:06:40.381 --> 01:06:43.301
Tonight there was
a very intimate spectator.

01:06:44.053 --> 01:06:45.513
Who?

01:06:45.553 --> 01:06:48.097
I'll tell you if you promise
to come and see me in the theater.

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:50.142
Who is that very intimate spectator?

01:06:51.352 --> 01:06:52.435
Federico.

01:06:52.477 --> 01:06:54.938
- Federico who?
- Federico Delgado.

01:06:55.814 --> 01:06:57.066
Your Marcelo.

01:06:58.609 --> 01:07:00.861
He came to my dressing room.

01:07:03.238 --> 01:07:05.657
- Did he recognize the text?
- Every word.

01:07:08.493 --> 01:07:10.662
He asked for
your phone number and address.

01:07:11.539 --> 01:07:13.624
You didn't tell him anything else?

01:07:13.665 --> 01:07:14.749
No.

01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:18.294
I said nothing about you chasing dragons.

01:07:19.504 --> 01:07:22.173
Thank you.
I'll come and see you one day.

01:07:23.133 --> 01:07:24.175
Sure.

01:07:48.658 --> 01:07:50.035
Salvador?

01:07:50.077 --> 01:07:51.578
Yes.

01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:53.247
Is that you?

01:07:53.289 --> 01:07:56.374
I wouldn't have recognized you.
This is Federico.

01:07:56.417 --> 01:07:57.585
Federico!

01:07:57.959 --> 01:07:59.086
I'm in Madrid.

01:08:02.464 --> 01:08:03.966
What are you doing here?

01:08:04.008 --> 01:08:07.970
Seeing lawyers about an inheritance.
I'm leaving tomorrow night.

01:08:08.011 --> 01:08:09.680
I'd like to see you.

01:08:09.722 --> 01:08:10.763
Same here.

01:08:12.057 --> 01:08:13.934
But I'm in bed now.

01:08:14.977 --> 01:08:16.895
Can we meet tomorrow?

01:08:16.935 --> 01:08:20.524
How about at midday?
I'm seeing the lawyers in the afternoon.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:21.941
Yes, perfect.

01:08:23.694 --> 01:08:25.696
I didn't ask how you are.

01:08:26.988 --> 01:08:28.156
Old.

01:08:29.323 --> 01:08:31.242
Five years older than me, not one more.

01:08:34.953 --> 01:08:36.707
And how are you?

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:40.002
I'm better now.

01:08:40.042 --> 01:08:42.796
When I left the theater I was devastated.

01:08:44.046 --> 01:08:45.673
I went to see Addiction.

01:08:46.801 --> 01:08:48.761
How did you know it was on?

01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:50.011
By pure chance.

01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.098
I took a walk round Embajadores,
to see our old street.

01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:56.435
I was outside our house.

01:08:56.475 --> 01:08:59.229
Of course, the theater
is a bit farther up.

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.774
I went in to pass the time

01:09:01.814 --> 01:09:05.318
and because I remembered
Alberto Crespo from your film.

01:09:05.359 --> 01:09:07.153
And you found yourself suddenly...

01:09:07.946 --> 01:09:09.573
Yes.

01:09:09.613 --> 01:09:10.740
Suddenly.

01:09:13.118 --> 01:09:14.953
I don't know how to apologize.

01:09:16.453 --> 01:09:18.207
I didn't know how you were feeling,

01:09:19.332 --> 01:09:20.667
all that you'd suffered.

01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:23.712
It was a good school.

01:09:24.296 --> 01:09:25.381
What?

01:09:26.296 --> 01:09:27.841
You don't have to apologize.

01:09:29.008 --> 01:09:31.261
I didn't do anything I didn't want to do.

01:09:35.265 --> 01:09:38.144
I tried to help you as far as I could.

01:09:38.185 --> 01:09:41.897
And I'm grateful.
I'd like to prove it to you some day.

01:09:44.399 --> 01:09:48.154
Look, I don't think I can
go to sleep after this.

01:09:48.988 --> 01:09:52.658
Can I have 20 minutes to shower and dress
and we'll meet at my place?

01:09:52.698 --> 01:09:55.034
Of course.

01:10:31.529 --> 01:10:32.864
Yes?

01:10:32.906 --> 01:10:34.992
It's Federico. Will you let me in?

01:10:35.034 --> 01:10:36.076
Come on.

01:11:01.435 --> 01:11:03.437
It's been so long. Come here.

01:11:08.150 --> 01:11:09.401
Too long.

01:11:18.327 --> 01:11:21.247
Would you recognize me
if you saw me in the street?

01:11:21.288 --> 01:11:24.083
I'd need to have looked closely, but yes.

01:11:24.123 --> 01:11:25.626
Your eyes are the same.

01:11:28.378 --> 01:11:31.172
- I'm sorry to get you out of bed.
- No, come in.

01:11:38.305 --> 01:11:39.472
It looks like a museum.

01:11:41.350 --> 01:11:45.104
I invested all that I earned
in this house and in these paintings.

01:11:46.312 --> 01:11:48.899
I'll give you a tour later.
What'll you have?

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.358
Anything.

01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:53.153
- Tequila?
- Yes, tequila.

01:11:53.195 --> 01:11:55.197
- In honor of Chavela.
- Ohh.

01:11:57.115 --> 01:12:00.743
When you mention her in the monologue,
I couldn't hold back the tears.

01:12:02.037 --> 01:12:03.414
Well, come on.

01:12:03.454 --> 01:12:06.457
Tequila for Chavela
and to celebrate our reunion.

01:12:13.923 --> 01:12:15.592
I love your house.

01:12:16.802 --> 01:12:18.846
Where do you live now?

01:12:18.887 --> 01:12:20.597
In Buenos Aires.

01:12:20.638 --> 01:12:22.891
Didn't you have an uncle there?

01:12:23.641 --> 01:12:26.060
Yes. I went there in '85.

01:12:27.061 --> 01:12:28.730
So soon?

01:12:28.771 --> 01:12:29.772
Yes.

01:12:31.609 --> 01:12:34.736
Shall I give you a summary now
or after the toast?

01:12:37.155 --> 01:12:38.990
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:12:42.953 --> 01:12:43.954
Ooh!

01:12:44.997 --> 01:12:46.039
The summary.

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.709
After we separated,
I stayed with my parents for a year.

01:12:50.461 --> 01:12:53.838
At that time, the heroin routes
didn't pass through Argentina.

01:12:53.881 --> 01:12:57.301
So I went there to my uncle
and worked in his restaurant.

01:12:58.010 --> 01:12:59.970
I couldn't take heroin
because there wasn't any.

01:13:00.012 --> 01:13:01.722
It was the best way to quit.

01:13:03.265 --> 01:13:07.645
I met Lucrecia, my wife, we got married,

01:13:07.686 --> 01:13:12.066
and now I have two grown sons,
my own restaurant.

01:13:12.106 --> 01:13:15.569
I only ever came back to Galicia
to see my parents.

01:13:17.613 --> 01:13:20.783
This is the first time
I've set foot in Madrid.

01:13:22.450 --> 01:13:25.245
Like you say in your monologue,
Madrid had become...

01:13:26.204 --> 01:13:27.872
a difficult ring for me...

01:13:28.873 --> 01:13:30.251
a minefield.

01:13:31.209 --> 01:13:33.378
It's a pity that you lived here.

01:13:35.756 --> 01:13:37.216
I needed Madrid.

01:13:38.967 --> 01:13:40.301
And I needed you.

01:13:41.553 --> 01:13:44.347
But not under those conditions.

01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:48.227
"Love isn't enough to save the person
you love." It's in your monologue.

01:13:48.269 --> 01:13:51.312
Let's not talk about the monologue.
It's a very sad text.

01:13:54.691 --> 01:13:56.694
I felt better

01:13:56.735 --> 01:14:00.406
when you said that while caring for me
you still continued to evolve

01:14:00.446 --> 01:14:02.824
as a writer and as a filmmaker.

01:14:02.867 --> 01:14:04.618
Did you really feel like that?

01:14:05.703 --> 01:14:08.998
You didn't interrupt anything, Federico.

01:14:09.707 --> 01:14:11.249
Just the opposite.

01:14:13.543 --> 01:14:16.087
You filled my life
like nothing and no one...

01:14:17.006 --> 01:14:18.339
has done until now.

01:14:23.303 --> 01:14:25.638
So you haven't been back to Madrid
since then?

01:14:25.681 --> 01:14:26.973
No.

01:14:27.016 --> 01:14:29.059
But I followed everything you did.

01:14:29.767 --> 01:14:31.561
And I was delighted

01:14:31.604 --> 01:14:35.524
when I recognized some scene
obviously inspired by us.

01:14:36.859 --> 01:14:40.821
Each film of yours was an event in my life

01:14:40.863 --> 01:14:44.325
and I was proud that you were
a success around the world.

01:14:44.365 --> 01:14:48.578
You're the only Spanish director
my family knows.

01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:50.122
Your new family.

01:14:52.790 --> 01:14:54.334
Yes.

01:14:57.796 --> 01:14:59.381
Do they know anything else?

01:15:00.882 --> 01:15:03.260
You mean about us?

01:15:03.302 --> 01:15:07.681
Lucrecia, my wife...
Well, my ex-wife. We're separating.

01:15:07.722 --> 01:15:10.309
I told her, but she doesn't know it's you,

01:15:10.351 --> 01:15:13.646
just that I was with a man
in Madrid for three years.

01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:16.731
And I told one of my sons
to encourage him.

01:15:20.735 --> 01:15:23.279
With time, I'll tell him it's you.

01:15:23.321 --> 01:15:26.784
He's a real film lover
and he'd never forgive me if I didn't.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:30.954
Do you have a partner now?

01:15:30.995 --> 01:15:32.163
Yes.

01:15:33.623 --> 01:15:34.749
And you?

01:15:35.333 --> 01:15:36.918
No. No.

01:15:38.169 --> 01:15:39.212
Man or woman?

01:15:40.047 --> 01:15:41.089
Woman.

01:15:42.757 --> 01:15:44.760
My experience with men ended with you.

01:15:48.346 --> 01:15:50.056
I don't know how to take that.

01:15:50.098 --> 01:15:52.016
Take it as a compliment.

01:15:54.019 --> 01:15:56.271
That's Mauro, the younger one.

01:15:59.691 --> 01:16:01.526
And this is Federico.

01:16:01.569 --> 01:16:02.945
He's 22 now.

01:16:02.986 --> 01:16:05.114
He's like you.

01:16:05.155 --> 01:16:07.574
He's the one I told.

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:09.952
They're both very handsome.

01:16:11.453 --> 01:16:14.330
You have to come to Buenos Aires.
You'll love the city.

01:16:14.373 --> 01:16:16.333
And I'm sure it'll inspire you.

01:16:16.374 --> 01:16:20.587
I want you to meet my family,
to come and eat in the restaurant.

01:16:20.628 --> 01:16:22.422
We'll get drunk together.

01:16:23.548 --> 01:16:24.716
Hmm?

01:16:33.851 --> 01:16:35.394
For the old days.

01:16:56.123 --> 01:16:58.459
Do you want me to stay and sleep with you?

01:16:59.418 --> 01:17:01.504
Of course I do,

01:17:01.544 --> 01:17:04.714
but we're going to close our story
as God intended.

01:17:04.757 --> 01:17:06.467
We never cared about God.

01:17:06.508 --> 01:17:09.427
And our story could be closed
just as well tomorrow morning.

01:17:10.428 --> 01:17:13.056
In any case, I'm delighted to see...

01:17:14.225 --> 01:17:16.392
that you still get aroused by me.

01:17:16.435 --> 01:17:18.604
Same here. You're aroused too.

01:17:18.645 --> 01:17:20.522
Yes. Go away.

01:17:21.356 --> 01:17:23.066
- Go away.
- Yes, I'm going.

01:17:25.235 --> 01:17:26.319
You're right.

01:17:27.488 --> 01:17:29.405
As usual.

01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:32.450
Remember that you've promised
to visit me in Buenos Aires.

01:17:32.493 --> 01:17:33.494
Mm-hmm.

01:17:40.376 --> 01:17:42.461
Safe journey.

01:17:42.503 --> 01:17:44.672
Thank you for coming. Really.

01:17:44.712 --> 01:17:46.548
I'll call to remind you.

01:18:52.864 --> 01:18:54.492
Yes, Salvador.

01:18:54.533 --> 01:18:56.410
Is this a good time?

01:18:56.452 --> 01:18:57.703
Yes, go ahead.

01:18:57.744 --> 01:19:00.955
I'd like to see Dr. Galindo
as soon as possible.

01:19:01.998 --> 01:19:03.501
What have you taken?

01:19:03.542 --> 01:19:06.712
Nothing. A tranquilizer two hours ago,
and a few shots of tequila.

01:19:06.753 --> 01:19:09.422
Now I'm taking my legal ration
of crushed tablets

01:19:09.464 --> 01:19:11.257
with liquid yogurt.

01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:13.593
And the gastroenterologist too?

01:19:13.636 --> 01:19:14.970
Yes, as soon as possible.

01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:16.763
Very well.

01:19:16.806 --> 01:19:18.682
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:54.135
Salvador Mallo?

01:19:54.176 --> 01:19:55.177
Yes.

01:19:55.970 --> 01:19:57.512
This way, please.

01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.312
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:20:06.355 --> 01:20:08.440
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning. Come in.

01:20:11.235 --> 01:20:14.029
- Thank you for finding time for us.
- Not at all.

01:20:14.696 --> 01:20:16.073
Tell me, Salvador.

01:20:17.490 --> 01:20:20.410
The pain in my back is killing me.

01:20:20.452 --> 01:20:22.288
The oxycodone does very little for me.

01:20:24.873 --> 01:20:26.791
We'll have to change your analgesic.

01:20:28.334 --> 01:20:30.753
Why didn't you come sooner?

01:20:30.796 --> 01:20:33.966
- I was feeling very low.
- Yes, he's been very depressed.

01:20:35.050 --> 01:20:37.261
And what have you done
to control the pain?

01:20:38.637 --> 01:20:40.473
I've started taking heroin.

01:20:45.561 --> 01:20:49.565
- And are you going to continue?
- No. That's why I'm here.

01:20:50.649 --> 01:20:52.318
How often did you take it?

01:20:54.195 --> 01:20:56.489
Every two or three days.

01:20:56.529 --> 01:20:59.032
In the end, every other day.

01:20:59.074 --> 01:21:00.451
Smoked on tinfoil.

01:21:01.577 --> 01:21:04.579
- When was the last time?
- The night before last.

01:21:06.123 --> 01:21:08.876
Will I have withdrawal symptoms?

01:21:08.918 --> 01:21:10.085
A bit.

01:21:10.127 --> 01:21:14.131
But with a compassionate and controlled
detoxification, you won't suffer.

01:21:14.172 --> 01:21:15.548
Compassionate and controlled?

01:21:15.591 --> 01:21:17.383
Yes, that's what it's called.

01:21:18.468 --> 01:21:20.011
Have you someone to help you?

01:21:20.053 --> 01:21:22.640
I'll be with him.

01:21:22.681 --> 01:21:25.810
How have you controlled
this period without it?

01:21:26.851 --> 01:21:28.354
With tranquilizers

01:21:28.395 --> 01:21:29.814
and a will of iron.

01:21:29.855 --> 01:21:32.525
You're going to keep needing
that will of iron

01:21:32.565 --> 01:21:34.568
because your mind knows
the effect of heroin

01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:35.945
and you don't forget that.

01:21:38.989 --> 01:21:41.116
You're still taking Paxtibi
for your headaches?

01:21:41.158 --> 01:21:43.953
Yes. And with all the rest.

01:21:43.994 --> 01:21:46.163
For asthma, blood pressure,

01:21:46.955 --> 01:21:48.164
insomnia...

01:21:49.542 --> 01:21:52.837
But most of all I need your help
with the pain in my back

01:21:52.878 --> 01:21:56.423
and to put some order
into everything I'm taking.

01:21:56.464 --> 01:21:58.300
With the migraines too.

01:21:58.342 --> 01:22:00.719
The pain in my back and the headaches...

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.388
leave me totally paralyzed.

01:22:04.265 --> 01:22:05.557
I understand.

01:22:06.432 --> 01:22:07.810
Do you have a new project?

01:22:08.601 --> 01:22:11.312
Yes. To improve my quality of life.

01:22:12.189 --> 01:22:13.566
I mean work.

01:22:14.732 --> 01:22:16.485
It would do you good to be busy.

01:22:17.528 --> 01:22:19.320
Don't you miss it?

01:22:19.363 --> 01:22:21.156
I think about it every day.

01:22:24.618 --> 01:22:27.745
But it isn't a question
of missing it or not.

01:22:29.998 --> 01:22:32.376
Filming is very physical work

01:22:32.418 --> 01:22:34.753
and unfortunately
I'm in no shape to do it.

01:22:34.794 --> 01:22:36.963
Actually, that's my big problem.

01:22:38.382 --> 01:22:39.967
People worse than you have managed.

01:22:40.008 --> 01:22:41.260
I know.

01:22:42.302 --> 01:22:43.761
But I haven't been able to.

01:22:44.262 --> 01:22:46.723
My mother died four years ago.

01:22:46.765 --> 01:22:48.851
Two years later I had the back operation.

01:22:51.227 --> 01:22:54.230
I think I still haven't recovered
from either thing.

01:22:56.984 --> 01:22:59.361
- I need help.
- Fine.

01:22:59.403 --> 01:23:01.780
I'll change the oxycodone
for another opiate.

01:23:03.281 --> 01:23:05.868
You'll think about heroin.

01:23:05.909 --> 01:23:09.454
- Watch out for that.
- Yes.

01:23:09.497 --> 01:23:12.415
I'll give you prescriptions
and explain the instructions.

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:16.878
Do you mind if I leave and walk around?

01:23:16.921 --> 01:23:18.422
Go on.

01:23:18.463 --> 01:23:20.841
- Doctor, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:23:29.391 --> 01:23:31.811
- Let's see...
- There's something else.

01:23:32.852 --> 01:23:34.020
Something else?

01:23:35.314 --> 01:23:37.691
Salvador chokes frequently.

01:23:37.732 --> 01:23:40.653
An hour ago, coming to the hospital,

01:23:40.694 --> 01:23:43.196
he had a sip of water,
and I thought he'd choke to death.

01:23:44.573 --> 01:23:46.909
The gastroenterologist did an endoscopy...

01:23:48.034 --> 01:23:51.579
and he found a lump
pressing on his esophagus.

01:23:51.622 --> 01:23:54.333
That's why he chokes so easily.

01:23:54.374 --> 01:23:56.918
We don't know what the lump is.

01:23:58.546 --> 01:24:00.422
Does he know the result?

01:24:00.463 --> 01:24:01.589
No.

01:24:02.842 --> 01:24:05.219
They've ordered a CAT scan to be sure.

01:24:06.637 --> 01:24:09.849
But the gastroenterologist
doesn't rule out that it's a tumor.

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.229
What should I do? Do I tell him?

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:18.940
No, no, no. Spare him
at least two days of anguish.

01:24:18.982 --> 01:24:21.068
Please, call me with the CAT scan results.

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:22.111
Of course.

01:24:34.998 --> 01:24:38.793
Mercedes, will you pass me
that box, please?

01:24:41.212 --> 01:24:42.297
Thank you.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:48.345
I'm really touched that you've put me
in your mother's room.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.776
I've brought you a snack.

01:25:02.818 --> 01:25:04.904
I'm not eating those black madeleines.

01:25:06.446 --> 01:25:08.324
They're whole wheat.

01:25:08.364 --> 01:25:11.159
One day you'll bring me
a plate of alfalfa to eat

01:25:11.202 --> 01:25:13.870
because now they say
it's good for your heart.

01:25:13.913 --> 01:25:15.455
Won't you drink the milk?

01:25:15.498 --> 01:25:17.790
You have to try.

01:25:17.833 --> 01:25:19.502
Later.

01:25:19.543 --> 01:25:20.753
Sit down.

01:25:24.131 --> 01:25:25.257
What are you doing?

01:25:25.298 --> 01:25:28.426
Trying to unravel these rosaries.

01:25:28.468 --> 01:25:29.552
I'll help you.

01:25:29.595 --> 01:25:31.180
No. You don't know how.

01:25:38.229 --> 01:25:40.189
Do you remember
how you have to lay me out?

01:25:40.230 --> 01:25:41.689
Yes, Mom.

01:25:41.731 --> 01:25:44.193
If we're in the village, call Petra.

01:25:44.235 --> 01:25:46.153
She's used to it.

01:25:46.195 --> 01:25:48.405
And if I die here, which I hope I don't,

01:25:48.446 --> 01:25:50.449
because I want to die in my bed.

01:25:50.490 --> 01:25:52.243
Maya and Mercedes will help you.

01:25:52.284 --> 01:25:54.954
- Must we talk about this now?
- Yes.

01:25:58.790 --> 01:26:00.208
On my head,

01:26:04.963 --> 01:26:06.381
a half mantilla,

01:26:07.173 --> 01:26:08.508
because I'm a widow.

01:26:09.301 --> 01:26:10.468
Let me help you.

01:26:10.511 --> 01:26:12.763
I'll help you.

01:26:16.766 --> 01:26:18.101
Like this.

01:26:18.144 --> 01:26:22.272
And the habit of Jesus of Medinaceli,
with its girdle.

01:26:22.314 --> 01:26:24.441
Yes, with its girdle.

01:26:24.482 --> 01:26:27.610
You put a rosary between my hands.

01:26:28.195 --> 01:26:30.489
The old one.

01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:32.533
I want you to keep the new one.

01:26:32.574 --> 01:26:34.909
- Wouldn't you prefer the new one?
- No.

01:26:36.995 --> 01:26:38.538
I want to be barefoot.

01:26:39.455 --> 01:26:41.083
If they tie my feet to bury me,

01:26:41.124 --> 01:26:43.752
you untie them and say I asked you to.

01:26:44.544 --> 01:26:48.173
The place where I'm going,
I want to go in very lightly.

01:26:52.093 --> 01:26:54.180
Do you remember this pen?

01:26:54.888 --> 01:26:55.972
Of course.

01:26:56.015 --> 01:26:57.475
Your father gave it to me.

01:26:57.516 --> 01:27:00.895
With it I wrote all the letters
when we were courting.

01:27:01.561 --> 01:27:02.937
And the wooden egg?

01:27:05.607 --> 01:27:08.526
I darned so much with this egg!

01:27:08.569 --> 01:27:12.364
Of all these things,
it's the least valuable.

01:27:12.405 --> 01:27:13.656
Give it to me.

01:27:15.909 --> 01:27:18.828
Here. You've just inherited it.

01:27:21.664 --> 01:27:23.249
I think about her a lot recently.

01:27:25.252 --> 01:27:27.463
It's the first time I've heard you say

01:27:27.504 --> 01:27:29.964
that you still haven't got over
your mother's death.

01:27:31.633 --> 01:27:33.551
I think a lot about my childhood too.

01:27:33.593 --> 01:27:36.555
When I'm dozing,
which is most of the time,

01:27:38.223 --> 01:27:41.017
I end up thinking about my mother
when I was a child.

01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:44.522
But you never talked about her
or your childhood in your films.

01:27:44.562 --> 01:27:47.274
- My mother didn't like me to.
- You think so?

01:27:48.984 --> 01:27:51.445
She told me one of the last times
she was in the hospital.

01:27:53.071 --> 01:27:55.199
Your legs are so clean, Mom.

01:27:56.659 --> 01:27:59.286
I took after my family in that.

01:27:59.328 --> 01:28:01.914
There are no varicose veins in my family.

01:28:01.955 --> 01:28:03.498
What a pity, love.

01:28:05.124 --> 01:28:06.126
Why?

01:28:06.961 --> 01:28:09.171
You won't have a good old age.

01:28:10.213 --> 01:28:12.048
Why not?

01:28:12.091 --> 01:28:14.135
You took after your father's family.

01:28:15.886 --> 01:28:18.138
Mom, the things you say.

01:28:18.180 --> 01:28:19.848
Did you sleep well last night?

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.517
So-so.

01:28:21.559 --> 01:28:23.936
I was with my neighbor Lola all night.

01:28:26.105 --> 01:28:28.357
Here, in the room?

01:28:28.399 --> 01:28:29.607
No.

01:28:29.650 --> 01:28:31.360
In dreams.

01:28:31.401 --> 01:28:33.194
I dreamed about her all night.

01:28:35.239 --> 01:28:37.283
I'd just arrived in the village,

01:28:38.492 --> 01:28:41.494
and I heard Lola knocking on my door,
as always,

01:28:41.537 --> 01:28:43.664
when she heard me arrive from Madrid.

01:28:45.958 --> 01:28:47.835
Even though it was a dream,

01:28:47.877 --> 01:28:50.296
I remembered that Lola was dead,

01:28:51.754 --> 01:28:54.007
but I opened the door,

01:28:54.048 --> 01:28:56.135
and there she was,

01:28:56.177 --> 01:28:58.053
just the same as ever,

01:28:59.471 --> 01:29:01.681
except that she was a bit transparent.

01:29:03.225 --> 01:29:05.686
But I wasn't scared.

01:29:05.727 --> 01:29:07.437
I said, "Lola,

01:29:08.855 --> 01:29:10.732
I suppose you're not happy...

01:29:11.775 --> 01:29:13.777
and you want me to do something,

01:29:15.195 --> 01:29:18.990
but you have to tell me what
and I promise I'll do it."

01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:24.622
"No, Jacinta, I'm happy," she answered.

01:29:26.539 --> 01:29:31.169
"How can you be happy?" I said.
"If you were, you wouldn't appear."

01:29:31.878 --> 01:29:34.214
"I'm appearing to you

01:29:34.256 --> 01:29:36.675
because my daughters
would be very scared."

01:29:37.717 --> 01:29:41.471
"But why are you coming to the village
when it's so cold?"

01:29:41.513 --> 01:29:43.973
"I don't feel cold or heat now,"

01:29:46.185 --> 01:29:47.520
she answered.

01:29:49.980 --> 01:29:52.232
"And there's nowhere better
than your house."

01:29:54.735 --> 01:29:57.613
"You're right about that," I said.

01:30:03.409 --> 01:30:04.744
What else?

01:30:08.039 --> 01:30:10.083
Don't get that storyteller look.

01:30:11.377 --> 01:30:14.171
I don't want you
putting any of this in your films.

01:30:14.212 --> 01:30:16.297
I don't like my neighbors appearing.

01:30:16.339 --> 01:30:18.383
I don't like autofiction!

01:30:18.425 --> 01:30:20.593
What do you know about autofiction?

01:30:20.636 --> 01:30:22.513
I heard you explain it in an interview.

01:30:23.806 --> 01:30:27.101
My neighbors don't like you showing them.

01:30:28.226 --> 01:30:30.937
They think you show them like rednecks.

01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:33.022
The things you say!

01:30:33.065 --> 01:30:35.734
I couldn't treat them
with more respect or devotion.

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.281
Whenever I can, I talk about you

01:30:40.321 --> 01:30:44.618
and I say that you and the neighbors
made me what I am.

01:30:46.537 --> 01:30:49.373
I owe everything to you.

01:30:50.039 --> 01:30:51.583
They don't like it.

01:30:54.419 --> 01:30:56.588
Let's go for a walk.
You haven't moved today.

01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:58.507
Because I had nowhere to go.

01:30:58.548 --> 01:31:00.967
- Now you do.
- Where?

01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:02.052
To the hallway.

01:31:12.145 --> 01:31:13.271
That's it.

01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:17.985
You haven't been a good son.

01:31:20.154 --> 01:31:22.031
- No?
- No.

01:31:23.199 --> 01:31:26.327
You never forgave me
for recommending you to the pious woman.

01:31:26.368 --> 01:31:29.038
I think you took revenge for that.

01:31:29.079 --> 01:31:31.540
I didn't want you to go
to the seminary either,

01:31:32.583 --> 01:31:34.126
but we were poor.

01:31:34.168 --> 01:31:37.630
It's true I didn't want to go,
but to say I wanted revenge...

01:31:37.671 --> 01:31:39.339
How can you think that?

01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:45.428
After you got your diploma,
you couldn't wait to get to Madrid.

01:31:47.181 --> 01:31:48.933
And when your father died,

01:31:50.016 --> 01:31:52.435
I asked if you wanted me to live with you.

01:31:53.604 --> 01:31:56.690
You wriggled out of it.

01:31:56.731 --> 01:32:02.695
You said you were living a life
that you couldn't share with me.

01:32:02.738 --> 01:32:04.615
And it was true.

01:32:04.656 --> 01:32:06.492
But not as you understood it.

01:32:07.534 --> 01:32:10.078
I understood it perfectly.

01:32:11.997 --> 01:32:14.333
I'm very bad on my feet,

01:32:14.374 --> 01:32:16.877
but my head is clear as a bell.

01:32:16.918 --> 01:32:19.504
When I wasn't traveling, I was filming.

01:32:19.547 --> 01:32:23.050
You couldn't have put up with the solitude
of an apartment in Madrid.

01:32:23.092 --> 01:32:25.177
That was no life for you.

01:32:25.218 --> 01:32:26.761
I'd have looked after you.

01:32:27.971 --> 01:32:31.057
I'd have adapted,
as I've done to so many things.

01:32:32.935 --> 01:32:34.770
But you didn't want it...

01:32:35.645 --> 01:32:37.272
and that hurt me.

01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:41.985
Mom...

01:32:43.445 --> 01:32:47.658
I'm very sorry
I was never the son you wanted.

01:32:50.535 --> 01:32:54.373
When you used to say
"Who did this child take after?"

01:32:55.958 --> 01:32:58.794
you weren't exactly saying it with pride,

01:33:01.462 --> 01:33:02.922
and I realized.

01:33:13.225 --> 01:33:16.227
I've failed you, simply by being as I am.

01:33:18.939 --> 01:33:20.065
I'm very sorry.

01:33:25.488 --> 01:33:27.071
Pass me St. Anthony.

01:33:29.533 --> 01:33:30.534
Here.

01:33:38.042 --> 01:33:39.919
I'll pray for you tonight.

01:33:41.212 --> 01:33:42.296
Thank you.

01:33:46.550 --> 01:33:48.677
- Salvador.
- Yes?

01:33:48.718 --> 01:33:50.971
I brought you into this world...

01:33:52.263 --> 01:33:54.934
and I slaved so you could get ahead.

01:33:55.559 --> 01:33:56.894
I know.

01:34:01.231 --> 01:34:02.816
Take me to the village.

01:34:04.651 --> 01:34:06.444
That's my last and only wish.

01:34:08.905 --> 01:34:10.031
Very well.

01:34:12.368 --> 01:34:13.953
We'll go to the village.

01:34:16.038 --> 01:34:18.915
With Maya, so she can do the housework.

01:34:18.958 --> 01:34:21.085
I'll look after you day and night.

01:34:21.961 --> 01:34:23.796
This time I won't let you down.

01:34:35.975 --> 01:34:38.017
But I couldn't keep my promise.

01:34:40.562 --> 01:34:42.690
The next day she went back to hospital.

01:34:43.649 --> 01:34:45.568
You did what you could.

01:34:46.526 --> 01:34:47.986
Yes,

01:34:48.988 --> 01:34:51.323
but she wanted to die in the village.

01:34:52.949 --> 01:34:55.243
And I'd promised to take her there.

01:34:57.288 --> 01:35:00.708
The poor thing died
in the ICU of a hospital,

01:35:02.584 --> 01:35:03.877
alone.

01:35:06.379 --> 01:35:09.300
You're invited to give a talk in Iceland.
It's well paid.

01:35:10.676 --> 01:35:13.471
I don't understand
why they like me so much in Iceland.

01:35:13.512 --> 01:35:14.513
Neither do I.

01:35:15.638 --> 01:35:18.100
This is from a little gallery.

01:35:19.142 --> 01:35:21.186
But I kept it. The drawing is lovely.

01:35:28.985 --> 01:35:31.196
- Salvador Mallo?
- Yes.

01:35:31.238 --> 01:35:32.280
You can come in.

01:35:36.452 --> 01:35:38.119
Sit down here slowly.

01:35:41.664 --> 01:35:44.251
While I raise your legs,

01:35:44.293 --> 01:35:46.545
you turn your body and gradually lie down.

01:35:50.423 --> 01:35:51.466
Thank you.

01:36:31.172 --> 01:36:32.925
When's your mother coming?

01:36:32.967 --> 01:36:34.176
At lunchtime.

01:36:35.177 --> 01:36:39.014
When she sews at the pious woman's house,
she stays all morning.

01:36:53.028 --> 01:36:54.780
Okay.

01:36:54.821 --> 01:36:57.867
Okay, Salvador. Don't move.

01:36:57.908 --> 01:36:58.950
Stay there.

01:37:05.498 --> 01:37:07.876
Can you hold the book with both hands?

01:37:09.461 --> 01:37:10.462
That's it.

01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:37.238
Now, raise your head.

01:37:51.253 --> 01:37:52.922
What do you think?

01:37:52.962 --> 01:37:54.339
It's lovely.

01:37:54.381 --> 01:37:57.885
I still have to finish it.
I'll take it home and do it.

01:37:57.927 --> 01:37:59.094
Yes.

01:38:01.513 --> 01:38:04.809
Do you mind if I get washed?
Look at the state I'm in.

01:38:04.850 --> 01:38:07.394
Yes, I'll get a bar of soap.

01:38:20.865 --> 01:38:22.493
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:39:29.642 --> 01:39:32.020
Salvador! Will you bring me a towel?

01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:34.397
Coming, Eduardo.

01:40:05.887 --> 01:40:09.516
You're burning up.
You must have gotten sunstroke.

01:40:21.486 --> 01:40:23.530
Salvador! What happened?

01:40:23.571 --> 01:40:25.281
He got a lot of sun.

01:40:25.324 --> 01:40:27.493
I was reading.

01:40:27.534 --> 01:40:29.994
Didn't you notice the sun shining on you?

01:40:30.037 --> 01:40:33.082
- You're burning up!
- I didn't notice.

01:40:33.123 --> 01:40:34.667
And you, what?

01:40:34.708 --> 01:40:36.794
I finished putting up the tiles.

01:40:36.836 --> 01:40:40.256
He fainted and I brought him here.

01:40:40.297 --> 01:40:41.632
You fainted?

01:40:41.673 --> 01:40:43.967
A bit. I got dizzy.

01:40:44.008 --> 01:40:45.301
Oh, my God.

01:40:45.343 --> 01:40:48.055
Stay here. I'll get a vinegar poultice.

01:40:48.096 --> 01:40:50.098
Where's your father? In the bar?

01:40:50.141 --> 01:40:51.392
Yes.

01:40:52.851 --> 01:40:55.019
He told me he'd stay in the house.

01:41:00.734 --> 01:41:02.444
What's this basin doing here?

01:41:02.485 --> 01:41:04.113
I had a wash.

01:41:04.154 --> 01:41:06.906
Couldn't you wait till you got home?

01:41:06.949 --> 01:41:10.411
It's hard work for me carrying water here.

01:41:10.452 --> 01:41:12.245
I was very dirty.

01:41:12.288 --> 01:41:14.080
I'll bring a basin and dry the floor.

01:41:14.123 --> 01:41:16.458
Bring me water and I'll dry it.

01:41:18.209 --> 01:41:19.919
The tiles turned out nicely.

01:41:22.589 --> 01:41:23.882
Yes, very nice. Thank you.

01:41:26.427 --> 01:41:27.970
I'll get the water.

01:41:47.906 --> 01:41:51.034
First, I want to reassure you.
There's no tumor.

01:41:51.075 --> 01:41:53.328
That's totally discounted.

01:41:53.369 --> 01:41:56.748
But something's wrong
because I choke even on purees.

01:41:56.789 --> 01:42:01.336
What you've got, that dysphagia,
is due to Forestier's Syndrome.

01:42:01.378 --> 01:42:02.922
You'll see it more clearly here.

01:42:05.173 --> 01:42:07.342
You see this white part,
next to the vertebra?

01:42:07.383 --> 01:42:11.596
It's an osteocyte, an ossification.

01:42:11.638 --> 01:42:14.809
Here, you can see the esophagus,
displaced by that ossification.

01:42:14.850 --> 01:42:17.477
There's practically no room
for food to get through,

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.021
not even liquids.

01:42:19.062 --> 01:42:20.564
That's why you choke.

01:42:21.397 --> 01:42:23.150
Why did that bone grow so much?

01:42:24.318 --> 01:42:28.530
Forestier's Syndrome is a rare disease
and we don't know what causes it.

01:42:28.571 --> 01:42:32.368
We know that it affects tendons,
ligaments and joints,

01:42:32.409 --> 01:42:35.371
which calcify and we don't know why.

01:42:35.412 --> 01:42:38.999
In your case, the anterior ligament
of the spine has calcified.

01:42:40.543 --> 01:42:41.710
Can anything be done?

01:42:41.752 --> 01:42:44.629
Surgery, to get rid of that calcification.

01:42:46.464 --> 01:42:49.592
But don't worry.
It isn't a risky operation.

01:42:50.593 --> 01:42:53.806
The gastroenterologist and the surgeon
can tell you more.

01:42:53.847 --> 01:42:55.682
- Very well.
- Thank you.

01:42:55.723 --> 01:42:58.144
POPULAR ART

01:43:16.078 --> 01:43:17.370
Hello.

01:43:18.998 --> 01:43:20.708
Do you like the watercolor?

01:43:21.542 --> 01:43:23.127
Yes. I'd like to buy it.

01:43:23.168 --> 01:43:25.879
- Who's the artist?
- It's anonymous.

01:43:25.921 --> 01:43:28.298
Almost all the works are unsigned.

01:43:30.008 --> 01:43:31.385
How did it get here?

01:43:31.427 --> 01:43:33.721
I bought it at the Flea Market
in Barcelona.

01:43:34.512 --> 01:43:36.515
It's one of my favorite works.

01:43:37.516 --> 01:43:40.769
So you have no idea who the artist is?

01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:43.230
There's something written on the back.

01:43:44.315 --> 01:43:49.361
But they're all anonymous artists who
probably don't even know they're artists.

01:43:52.948 --> 01:43:54.158
Dear Salvador,

01:43:54.909 --> 01:43:59.121
I'm sending the drawing to your house
because I don't have the school address.

01:43:59.163 --> 01:44:01.624
I'm happy to be able to write to you.

01:44:01.664 --> 01:44:02.999
You taught me

01:44:03.042 --> 01:44:05.252
and I'm very grateful to you.

01:44:05.293 --> 01:44:08.004
I'm working in Conchita's uncle's store

01:44:08.047 --> 01:44:10.089
and I'm very good at numbers.

01:44:10.132 --> 01:44:12.009
All thanks to you.

01:44:12.051 --> 01:44:15.262
It's nice here,
but I miss life in the caves.

01:44:15.303 --> 01:44:17.515
And you in particular.

01:44:17.556 --> 01:44:21.227
Every time I write
I think of your hand guiding mine.

01:44:21.267 --> 01:44:23.561
I'm sure you're learning a lot at school,

01:44:23.604 --> 01:44:26.606
reading lots of books
and seeing lots of films.

01:44:26.649 --> 01:44:28.609
Here's my address in Bilbao.

01:44:28.650 --> 01:44:30.528
Maybe you'll write and tell me.

01:44:30.569 --> 01:44:33.696
Your pupil, Eduardo.

01:45:19.118 --> 01:45:20.119
Salvador.

01:45:21.119 --> 01:45:23.288
You'll have to start getting dressed
in half an hour.

01:45:23.329 --> 01:45:25.332
Remind me just before.

01:45:34.425 --> 01:45:41.140
THE FIRST DESIRE

01:45:48.062 --> 01:45:50.149
What happened with the drawing?

01:45:53.569 --> 01:45:55.154
Eduardo sent it to Paterna.

01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.448
My mother would have got it.

01:45:58.531 --> 01:46:00.534
I was at the priests' school.

01:46:01.534 --> 01:46:03.787
She never sent it or mentioned it.

01:46:06.539 --> 01:46:08.292
Are you going to look for him?

01:46:09.502 --> 01:46:12.421
- For Eduardo?
- With Google.

01:46:12.462 --> 01:46:14.255
Or going to Paterna and asking about him.

01:46:14.297 --> 01:46:15.925
Fifty years later?

01:46:18.468 --> 01:46:22.640
It's a good idea for a story
and maybe I'll write it,

01:46:22.681 --> 01:46:24.517
but looking for him would be crazy.

01:46:24.557 --> 01:46:26.726
How did it get
to the Flea Market in Barcelona?

01:46:26.769 --> 01:46:27.895
No idea.

01:46:28.479 --> 01:46:29.730
By chance.

01:46:32.399 --> 01:46:35.820
What matters is it finally got to the one
it was intended for.

01:46:53.878 --> 01:46:56.673
We're going to move you over here,
bit by bit.

01:47:01.803 --> 01:47:03.681
Your head here.

01:47:14.607 --> 01:47:20.114
I have to pull this down a bit
and put some stickers on your chest.

01:47:36.504 --> 01:47:37.506
How are you?

01:47:39.175 --> 01:47:40.926
Hello, Doctor.

01:47:40.967 --> 01:47:44.053
I heard. No wonder you couldn't swallow.

01:47:44.096 --> 01:47:46.557
But don't worry.
We'll get rid of this right away.

01:47:48.100 --> 01:47:50.519
- Doctor.
- Yes?

01:47:50.561 --> 01:47:53.439
- I'm writing again.
- That's good news.

01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:56.274
- Yes.
- I'm delighted.

01:47:56.316 --> 01:47:58.319
And what is it? Drama or comedy?

01:47:58.944 --> 01:48:00.654
I don't know.

01:48:00.695 --> 01:48:01.988
You never know until...

01:48:19.964 --> 01:48:20.966
Mom.

01:48:22.885 --> 01:48:25.721
Do you think there's a cinema in Paterna?

01:48:28.223 --> 01:48:30.935
If we have a house,
that'll be enough for me.

01:48:50.579 --> 01:48:52.790
- Cut.
- We've cut.

01:48:55.333 --> 01:48:57.836
38, 5, first. Final clapper.

01:48:59.087 --> 01:49:02.048
