WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.103
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.103 --> 00:05.406
SUSAN AND MIKE
FINALLY TIED THE KNOT.

00:05.406 --> 00:08.509
LYNETTE GOT
SOME DISTURBING NEWS.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.042
WHERE THE HELL DO YOU
GET OFF HAVING CANCER

00:11.042 --> 00:13.184
AND NOT TELLING ME ABOUT IT?
 MOM.

00:13.184 --> 00:14.745
BREE RETURNED FROM HER TRIP...

00:14.745 --> 00:16.015
HOLY CRAP!

00:16.015 --> 00:18.489
WITH A SURPRISE.
 THERE YOU GO.

00:18.489 --> 00:20.091
GABY MARRIED VICTOR.

00:20.091 --> 00:22.053
GABY IS THE SMARTEST THING
YOU'VE EVER DONE.

00:22.053 --> 00:23.724
WITH HER BRINGING IN
THE LATINO VOTE,

00:23.724 --> 00:26.397
THE GOVERNOR'S MANSION'S
AS GOOD AS YOURS.
 WHILE CARLOS...

00:26.397 --> 00:30.030
WHY ARE YOU SO RELUCTANT
TO MAKE A COMMITMENT TO ME?
 ENDED IT WITH EDIE.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.732
I AM DONE WITH YOU.

00:33.664 --> 00:37.638
BUT THE SEARCH
FOR TRUE HAPPINESS

00:37.638 --> 00:39.210
LED TO EVENTS

00:39.210 --> 00:42.143
THAT WERE UNEXPECTED
AND DISTINCTLY...

00:42.143 --> 00:43.644
(chair falls to floor)

00:43.644 --> 00:45.045
DESPERATE.

00:48.179 --> 00:50.481
(Mary Alice) THE FIRST THING
YOU SHOULD KNOW

00:50.481 --> 00:56.157
IS THAT EDIE BRITT
NEVER ACTUALLY INTENDED TO DIE,

00:56.157 --> 01:01.162
BUT SOMEONE SHE LOVED
WAS TRYING TO LEAVE HER.

01:01.162 --> 01:03.834
SO SHE PLANNED EVERY DETAIL,

01:03.834 --> 01:07.398
FROM THE SILK SCARF
SHE'D HANG BY

01:07.398 --> 01:12.072
TO THE SUICIDE NOTE
DETAILING HER DESPAIR.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.506
NOW ALL EDIE HAD TO DO...

01:15.506 --> 01:17.608
WAS WAIT...

01:17.608 --> 01:21.212
FOR HER BELOVED TO COME HOME.

01:21.212 --> 01:24.155
HEY, EDIE!
I'M HERE TO GET MY STUFF.

01:24.155 --> 01:26.517
YOU SEE,
TO HOLD ON TO HER MAN,

01:26.517 --> 01:30.361
EDIE KNEW SHE'D HAVE TO FIND
THE PERFECT MOMENT

01:30.361 --> 01:32.493
TO LET GO.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.327
HEY, CARLOS!

01:36.327 --> 01:38.098
SADLY FOR EDIE...

01:38.098 --> 01:40.501
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

01:40.501 --> 01:43.174
HER TIMING WAS FATALLY FLAWED.

01:43.174 --> 01:46.777
(Carlos) MRS. McCLUSKEY?
 I NEED TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
COME HERE.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.284
WHAT'S THIS?

01:53.284 --> 01:55.786
UH...
THOSE ARE TRASH CANS.

01:55.786 --> 01:57.788
I KNOW THEY'RE TRASH CANS,
SMART-ASS.

01:57.788 --> 02:00.851
I'M ASKING WHAT THEY'RE
DOING OUT ON A SATURDAY NIGHT

02:00.851 --> 02:03.354
WHEN THE TRASH
GOT PICKED UP ON THURSDAY.

02:07.127 --> 02:11.202
FINE. I WILL TAKE THEM IN.
HAPPY NOW?

02:11.202 --> 02:14.535
CARLOS...
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

02:27.448 --> 02:30.251
AND THIS IS HOW CARLOS SOLIS

02:30.251 --> 02:32.783
ARRIVED
JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME

02:32.783 --> 02:36.757
TO SAVE THE LIFE OF EDIE BRITT.

02:36.757 --> 02:39.930
(whispers) OH, BABY.
WHAT DID YOU DO?

02:39.930 --> 02:42.633
COME ON, YOU GOTTA WAKE UP.
COME ON, PLEASE?

02:42.633 --> 02:44.195
OF COURSE,

02:44.195 --> 02:47.498
HAD HE KNOWN WHAT SHE
WAS ABOUT TO DO TOHISLIFE...

02:49.340 --> 03:00.611
HE WOULD'VE LET HER HANG THERE.

03:00.611 --> 03:04.585
THERE IS
A CERTAIN TIME OF NIGHT,

03:04.585 --> 03:07.258
AFTER CHILDREN
HAVE BEEN PUT TO BED

03:07.258 --> 03:10.561
AND HUSBANDS
HAVE BEGUN SNORING,

03:10.561 --> 03:13.494
THAT WOMEN LIE AWAKE
AND THINK OF THE SECRETS

03:13.494 --> 03:16.927
THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING
FROM THEIR FRIENDS.

03:16.927 --> 03:20.901
IT MIGHT BE
AN IMPROMPTU WEDDING...

03:20.901 --> 03:25.636
OR A RECENTLY DIAGNOSED
TUMOR...

03:25.636 --> 03:29.910
OR A MAKE-BELIEVE PREGNANCY.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.413
REGARDLESS,
IT'S ALL THEY WILL THINK OF...

03:32.413 --> 03:35.686
(siren wailing)
 UNTIL SOMETHING COMES ALONG
TO REMIND THEM

03:35.686 --> 03:41.221
THAT OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE SECRETS, TOO.

03:44.555 --> 03:46.557
CARLOS... HOW IS SHE?

03:46.557 --> 03:49.830
WHAT DID THE DOCTORS SAY?
 UH, THEY'VE GOT EDIE
ON A VENTILATOR,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.832
BUT SHE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
 WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

03:51.832 --> 03:54.405
HOW COULD SHE
PULL A STUNT LIKE THIS?

03:54.405 --> 03:57.368
UH, SHE LEFT A NOTE
WHICH PRETTY MUCH BLAMES ME.

03:57.368 --> 03:58.969
OH, SWEETIE.

03:58.969 --> 04:01.241
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS HAPPENING.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.244
IT'S LIKE MARY ALICE
ALL OVER AGAIN.
 YES, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS
SHE'S GONNA LIVE.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.377
I KNOW
IT'S HER WEDDING NIGHT,

04:06.377 --> 04:09.380
BUT DO YOU THINK
WE SHOULD CALL GABY?

04:09.380 --> 04:10.851
OH, CRAP.

04:13.984 --> 04:16.827
(knocking on door)

04:16.827 --> 04:18.488
GABY?

04:18.488 --> 04:21.492
YOU KNOW, THIS BETTER BE
ONE HELL OF A WEDDING NIGHT,

04:21.492 --> 04:23.494
CONSIDERING HOW LONG
YOU'RE TAKING IN THERE.

04:23.494 --> 04:26.497
TRUST ME, VICTOR. THIS WILL BE
A NIGHT YOU'LL NEVER FORGET.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.271
(Carlos)
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
 (Gabrielle) WHAT?!

04:31.271 --> 04:33.444
I'M SERIOUS. YOU, ME--
JUST SCREW IT ALL.

04:33.444 --> 04:35.576
LET'S... LET'S RUN AWAY
TOGETHER.
 I JUST GOT MARRIED.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.578
THERE ARE 200 PEOPLE
OUT THERE

04:37.578 --> 04:40.511
WAITING FOR ME
TO LEAD A CONGA LINE.
 GABY, YOU JUST SAID

04:40.511 --> 04:43.314
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE
VICTOR REALLY LOVES YOU,

04:43.314 --> 04:46.317
AND YOU KNOW I DO.
I'VE NEVER STOPPED.
 I CAN'T DUMP HIM
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

04:46.317 --> 04:48.719
THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING TO DO,
EVEN TO VICTOR.

04:48.719 --> 04:51.722
HE'LL GET OVER IT, BUT I'VE
NEVER GOTTEN OVER LOSING YOU,

04:51.722 --> 04:53.724
AND I WON'T
LET IT HAPPEN AGAIN!

04:53.724 --> 04:55.466
(Victor) GABY, YOU IN HERE?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.770
GABY?

05:03.504 --> 05:06.337
OH. HI.

05:06.337 --> 05:07.678
HI!

05:07.678 --> 05:10.381
I WAS... JUST COUNTING GIFTS.
(laughs nervously)

05:10.381 --> 05:11.682
OH, THAT'S FINE.

05:11.682 --> 05:13.944
I-I WAS ACTUALLY LOOKING
FOR THAT PUBLICIST GUY.

05:13.944 --> 05:15.946
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,
HAVE YOU?
 NOPE.

05:15.946 --> 05:19.390
OKAY. I'LL GIVE YOU
A HOLLER WHEN I NEED YOU.

05:20.851 --> 05:22.693
(whispers) COME ON!

05:24.695 --> 05:27.828
WHO DOESN'T WEAR UNDERWEAR
ON THEIR WEDDING DAY?

05:27.828 --> 05:29.830
(normal voice)
OH, FOCUS, YOU IDIOT!

05:29.830 --> 05:32.102
COME ON.
WHEN ARE WE LEAVING?

05:32.102 --> 05:34.104
(sighs)
SO WE'RE DOING THIS?

05:34.104 --> 05:36.036
GREAT.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.939
UH, IT'LL TAKE ME A FEW HOURS
TO GET STUFF TOGETHER.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.942
I'M GONNA PICK YOU UP TONIGHT.
JUST BE PACKED AND READY TO GO.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.974
OKAY. WAIT!

05:43.974 --> 05:46.447
AREN'T YOU GONNA
KISS THE BRIDE?

05:48.379 --> 05:51.351
(cell phone rings)

05:51.351 --> 05:52.683
(ring)

05:52.683 --> 05:53.854
(whispers) FINALLY!
 (beep)

05:53.854 --> 05:56.356
(hushed voice) CARLOS,
WHERE THE HELL ARE YOU?!

05:56.356 --> 05:58.859
I'M AT THE HOSPITAL. EDIE TRIED
TO KILL HERSELF TONIGHT.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.692
OH, MY GOD! IS SHE OKAY?
 I FOUND HER JUST IN TIME,

06:01.692 --> 06:03.694
BUT OBVIOUSLY, I CAN'T
COME PICK YOU UP TONIGHT.

06:03.694 --> 06:07.398
OKAY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL
JUST TAKE A CAB AND MEET YOU.

06:07.398 --> 06:10.471
GABY, I CAN'T LEAVE EDIE NOW.
LOOK, MAYBE IN A COUPLE WEEKS.

06:10.471 --> 06:13.474
IN A FEW WEEKS?! WHAT?!
NO! IT HAS TO BE TONIGHT!

06:13.474 --> 06:16.477
VICTOR'S IN THE BEDROOM
RIGHT NOW WAITING TO CONSUMMATE.

06:16.477 --> 06:18.479
AND EDIE'S ON A VENTILATOR.

06:18.479 --> 06:21.412
LOOK, YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY
WITH VICTOR. YOU HAVE A HOUSE.

06:21.412 --> 06:24.615
OKAY, YOU KNOW, RUNNING AWAY
WITH YOU ON MY WEDDING NIGHT

06:24.615 --> 06:26.116
WAS CRAZY ENOUGH.

06:26.116 --> 06:28.789
BUT RUNNING AWAY
TO BE ALONE IS INSANE!

06:28.789 --> 06:32.092
GABY, PLEASE, SHE NEEDS ME.
CAN'T YOU JUST WAIT?

06:32.092 --> 06:35.996
NO! I WOULD RATHER TRY
AND WORK IT OUT WITH VICTOR.
 (beep)

06:37.928 --> 06:40.471
(sighs deeply)

06:40.471 --> 06:43.474
(Victor) GABY,
ARE YOU COMING TO BED?

06:57.548 --> 07:00.521
HAPPY 1-MONTH ANNIVERSARY.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.793
OH! I DIDN'T KNOW
WE WERE DOING THIS.

07:02.793 --> 07:05.025
WELL, WE'VE JUST BEEN SO HAPPY
THE LAST FOUR WEEKS,

07:05.025 --> 07:06.897
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

07:06.897 --> 07:09.460
(both laugh)

07:10.801 --> 07:12.432
YOUAREHAPPY, RIGHT?

07:12.432 --> 07:15.466
YEAH.
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.468
AW, THAT'S SWEET. (laughs)

07:22.012 --> 07:24.575
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

07:24.575 --> 07:25.946
SUSAN--

07:25.946 --> 07:27.778
I WATCH YOU SOMETIMES,

07:27.778 --> 07:30.721
AND YOU SEEM VERY...
DISCONNECTED,

07:30.721 --> 07:32.452
LIKE SOMETHING'S MISSING.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.924
NOTHING IS MISSING.

07:33.924 --> 07:36.927
SO OUR LIFE TOGETHER IS
EXACTLY HOW YOU PICTURED IT?

07:36.927 --> 07:39.630
YOU'VE GOTTEN EVERYTHING
YOU WANTED?
 YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

07:39.630 --> 07:40.631
AHA!

07:40.631 --> 07:42.192
AHA?
 "PRETTY MUCH" MEANS

07:42.192 --> 07:45.195
THERE IS SOMETHING THAT
YOU WANT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE.

07:45.195 --> 07:47.938
HOW CAN I GIVE IT TO YOU
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME WHAT IT IS?

07:47.938 --> 07:49.600
SUSAN, I SWEAR,

07:49.600 --> 07:52.873
I AM ECSTATICALLY,
BEYOND MY WILDEST DREAMS,

07:52.873 --> 07:54.545
LIP-SMACKINGLY HAPPY.

07:54.545 --> 07:56.246
YOU GOT IT?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.552
THIS MARRIAGE IS DOOMED.

08:02.713 --> 08:05.716
(vehicle approaching)

08:05.716 --> 08:09.590
HEY, A MOVING VAN
JUST PULLED UP.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.491
OH, ANDREW, I'M HAVING
PROBLEMS WITH MY STRAP.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.163
COULD YOU HELP ME?

08:13.163 --> 08:15.165
LOOK,
I TOLD YOU THREE WEEKS AGO

08:15.165 --> 08:17.668
I WAS NO LONGER PARTICIPATING
IN YOUR LITTLE HOAX,

08:17.668 --> 08:20.500
AND THAT INCLUDES
STRAPPING YOU IN.
 OH, FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.502
ORSON, COULD YOU
COME HELP ME, PLEASE?

08:22.502 --> 08:23.804
I'LL REMEMBER THIS

08:23.804 --> 08:26.506
THE NEXT TIME YOU WANT MONEY
FOR LEATHER PANTS.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.508
PEOPLE ARE GONNA FIND OUT,
ALL RIGHT?

08:28.508 --> 08:30.581
AND THEN WE'RE
GONNA ALL LOOK LIKE IDIOTS.

08:30.581 --> 08:32.082
WELL, NOT IF WE'RE CAREFUL.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.744
THIS ISN'T THE '50s, OKAY?

08:33.744 --> 08:35.746
TEENAGE GIRLS GET PREGNANT
ALL THE TIME.

08:35.746 --> 08:38.619
I MEAN, MY EX-LAB PARTNER'S
PRACTICALLY A GRANDMOTHER.

08:38.619 --> 08:41.751
LOOK, THIS FAMILY'S REPUTATION
IS ALREADY HANGING BY A THREAD.

08:41.751 --> 08:43.894
I MEAN, FIRST PEOPLE THOUGHT

08:43.894 --> 08:45.896
THAT YOUR STEPFATHER
WAS A WIFE KILLER,

08:45.896 --> 08:47.898
THEN YOUR SISTER TAKES UP
WITH HER HISTORY TEACHER,

08:47.898 --> 08:50.601
AND NOW WE'RE SUPPOSED TO
PARADE A LITTLE BASTARD

08:50.601 --> 08:52.202
UP AND DOWN THE STREET.

08:52.202 --> 08:55.205
WE MIGHT AS WELL SIT
ON THE PORCH AND PLAY BANJOS.

08:55.205 --> 08:58.609
BREE, YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A MOVING VAN NEXT DOOR.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.743
(pounding on door)

09:02.743 --> 09:05.115
(Parker) MOM, ARE YOU AWAKE?

09:05.115 --> 09:08.548
OKAY, HONEY.
JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.550
GIVE ME A MINUTE.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.682
(sighs)

09:13.153 --> 09:14.655
HEY. HEY!

09:14.655 --> 09:17.628
MY WIG IS GONE.
WHERE IS IT?

09:17.628 --> 09:18.729
IT'S ON THE NIGHTSTAND.

09:18.729 --> 09:20.731
NO! NO, I'M LOOKING
AT THE NIGHTSTAND,

09:20.731 --> 09:22.733
AND ALL I SEE
ARE A FEW STRAY HAIRS

09:22.733 --> 09:25.666
AND THIS SPORTS BLOOPER DVD
YOU THOUGHT WOULD CHEER ME UP.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.167
PEYTON MANNING IS FUNNY.

09:27.167 --> 09:28.699
(Parker) MOM!

09:28.699 --> 09:30.641
HEY, I'M COMING!

09:30.641 --> 09:32.643
HEY, DON'T JUST SIT THERE
LIKE A LUMP!

09:32.643 --> 09:34.645
COME ON!
HELP ME LOOK! LOOK!

09:34.645 --> 09:36.977
OH, GOD. HONEY,
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

09:36.977 --> 09:39.579
WHEN IT OCCURS TO ME
THAT WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER

09:39.579 --> 09:41.581
IF WE JUST TOLD EVERYONE
THAT YOU HAVE CANCER?

09:41.581 --> 09:43.814
OOH! I FOUND IT.
 LOOK, I MEAN, I GET
NOT WANTING TO SCARE THE KIDS,

09:43.814 --> 09:48.058
BUT TO KEEP ALL OF
OUR FRIENDS IN THE DARK...
 LOOK, I CAN DEAL
WITH THE CHEMO.

09:48.058 --> 09:50.590
I CAN DEAL
WITH PEOPLE TELLING ME

09:50.590 --> 09:52.592
MY HAIR HAS NEVER
LOOKED BETTER.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.825
BUT WHAT I CANNOT DEAL WITH
IS THE PITY,

09:54.825 --> 09:57.798
SO WE ARE DOING IT MY WAY.

10:00.130 --> 10:01.932
YOU WERE CROOKED.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.135
(sighs)

10:05.135 --> 10:07.607
HEY, SWEETIE, WHAT'S UP?

10:07.607 --> 10:10.040
THERE'S A MOVING VAN
ACROSS THE STREET.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.683
(man) SO YOU WANT IT LISTED
RIGHT AWAY?

10:12.683 --> 10:15.185
AND DON'T WORRY
ABOUT GETTING TOP DOLLAR.

10:15.185 --> 10:17.918
I WANT THIS PLACE
PRICED TO MOVE.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.920
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

10:19.920 --> 10:23.323
I'M MEETING WITH OUR REALTOR.
GABY, YOU REMEMBER GIL.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.825
I REMEMBER TELLING YOU

10:24.825 --> 10:27.097
I WASN'T READY
TO SELL THE HOUSE YET.

10:27.097 --> 10:29.700
GIL, COULD YOU
GIVE US A MINUTE, PLEASE?
 YEAH.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.202
GABY, WE AGREED
THAT AFTER WE GOT MARRIED,

10:32.202 --> 10:34.204
YOU WOULD SELL THE HOUSE.

10:34.204 --> 10:36.206
I STILL HAVE
A LOT OF STUFF HERE.

10:36.206 --> 10:38.208
WELL, MY HOUSE
IS OVER 10,000 SQUARE FEET.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.210
I'M PRETTY SURE
THERE ARE CLOSETS.

10:40.210 --> 10:43.173
I'M JUST NOT IN A RUSH
TO UNLOAD THIS HOUSE, OKAY?

10:43.173 --> 10:45.175
THIS WAS MY HOME.
I WAS VERY HAPPY HERE.

10:45.175 --> 10:48.178
BUT WE'VE GOT A NEW HOME NOW.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY THERE?

10:48.178 --> 10:50.350
YEAH, IT'S A GREAT HOUSE.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.753
WELL, GOOD.
THEN SELL THIS PLACE.

10:52.753 --> 10:55.826
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

10:58.658 --> 11:01.091
I'M NOT WAITING
FOR ANYTHING.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.995
OH! LOOK, A MOVING VAN.

11:04.995 --> 11:06.697
(man) ONLY ONE MORE!

11:06.697 --> 11:08.769
(man) ALL RIGHT,
BRING IN THE DOLLY!

11:08.769 --> 11:12.102
NEW NEIGHBORS.
WHAT DO WE KNOW?

11:12.102 --> 11:14.805
WELL, UH, DINING CHAIRS.
THERE'S A CLUE.

11:14.805 --> 11:16.747
YES. IT PROVES
THEY EAT SITTING DOWN.

11:16.747 --> 11:19.750
NO, I MEAN THEY'RE STICKLEY.
IT MEANS THEY HAVE TASTE.

11:19.750 --> 11:22.382
ANDMONEY. THEY'VE BEEN
REMODELING FOR WEEKS.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.755
(Susan) I WISH EDIE WERE HERE.

11:24.755 --> 11:27.758
WITHOUT HER, THERE'S NO ONE
TO GIVE US THE DISH.

11:27.758 --> 11:29.059
YET ANOTHER ILLUSTRATION

11:29.059 --> 11:32.092
OF THE FUNDAMENTAL SELFISHNESS
OF SUICIDE.

11:34.725 --> 11:37.067
DO YOU THINK THIS IS THEM?

11:37.067 --> 11:38.769
(car door opens)

11:48.879 --> 11:51.711
OH, MY GOD. KATHERINE.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.183
(laughs)

11:53.183 --> 11:54.714
KATHERINE!

11:54.714 --> 11:57.417
(gasps) SUSAN!

11:57.417 --> 12:00.020
(laughs)

12:00.020 --> 12:01.721
(Susan and Katherine laugh)

12:04.724 --> 12:06.726
I CANNOT BELIEVE
IT HAS BEEN 12 YEARS.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.729
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.
 WELL, YOU CLEARLY HAVE.
YOUR EYESIGHT'S GOING.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.261
(both laugh)

12:11.261 --> 12:13.503
MM. HOW'S YOUR AUNT?

12:13.503 --> 12:15.505
KATHERINE USED TO LIVE HERE
WITH MRS. SIMS.

12:15.505 --> 12:17.507
(sighs)
NOT VERY WELL, I'M AFRAID.

12:17.507 --> 12:20.140
THAT'S REALLY THE REASON
WHY WE MOVED BACK.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.142
I DIDN'T WANT POOR AUNT LILY

12:22.142 --> 12:24.144
TO SPEND HER FINAL DAYS
IN A NURSING HOME.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.516
THAT IS SO KIND OF YOU.

12:26.516 --> 12:27.948
(Susan) YEAH, IT IS.
 (front door closes)

12:27.948 --> 12:31.822
OH, AND AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,
MY HUSBAND FOUND A JOB HERE.

12:31.822 --> 12:34.284
ADAM, COULD YOU WAVE
OR SOMETHING?

12:34.284 --> 12:36.086
HELLO, LADIES.
 (Lynette) HI.

12:36.086 --> 12:39.129
I LOOK FORWARD TO MEETING YOU
WHEN I'M A LITTLE LESS SWEATY.
 (all laugh)

12:39.129 --> 12:41.761
HE'S A CUTIE.
WHAT DOES HE DO?

12:41.761 --> 12:44.034
HE'S A DOCTOR.

12:44.034 --> 12:47.167
OKAY, DON'T TAKE THIS
PERSONALLY, BUT WE HATE YOU.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.368
MOM?

12:48.368 --> 12:51.101
I FINISHED UNPACKING MY ROOM.
DO YOU NEED ANY HELP?

12:51.101 --> 12:54.344
OH, MY GOD.
THIS ISNOTLITTLE DYLAN.

12:54.344 --> 12:56.546
(laughs)
I'M SUSAN, JULIE'S MOM.

12:56.546 --> 12:59.149
SHE IS GONNA BE SO EXCITED
TO SEE YOU.

12:59.149 --> 13:00.350
GREAT.

13:00.350 --> 13:02.082
WHO'S JULIE AGAIN?

13:02.082 --> 13:04.915
HONEY, YOU REMEMBER--YOUR BEST
FRIEND WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE.

13:04.915 --> 13:07.257
OH, RIGHT.
 WHY DON'T YOU

13:07.257 --> 13:10.921
GO HELP YOUR STEPFATHER
WITH THE LAST FEW BOXES?
 IT'S NICE MEETING YOU ALL.

13:10.921 --> 13:13.093
(Bree)
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.265
I FEEL SO LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU FOR A NEIGHBOR.

13:15.265 --> 13:18.428
NO,IAM THE LUCKY ONE.
LOOK AT MY VIEW.

13:18.428 --> 13:21.932
YOUR GARDEN
IS ABSOLUTELY BREATHTAKING.

13:21.932 --> 13:23.073
(Susan) YEAH.

13:23.073 --> 13:25.805
AND THAT PINE TREE
IN THE BACKYARD...

13:25.805 --> 13:27.577
IT'S MY PRIDE AND JOY.

13:27.577 --> 13:29.239
OH, IT ABSOLUTELY KILLS ME

13:29.239 --> 13:31.581
TO HAVE TO ASK YOU
TO CUT IT DOWN.

13:31.581 --> 13:33.213
EXCUSE ME?

13:33.213 --> 13:35.415
WELL, I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

13:35.415 --> 13:37.217
TO GROW
MY PRIZE-WINNING VEGETABLES

13:37.217 --> 13:39.589
WITH THAT TREE BLOCKING
ALL THE SUNLIGHT.

13:39.589 --> 13:42.292
OH, WELL, I'M--I'M SORRY
ABOUT YOUR VEGETABLES,

13:42.292 --> 13:45.255
BUT THAT PINE SHIELDS MY VIEW
OF THE PURCELLS' BACKYARD,

13:45.255 --> 13:47.257
AND IF YOU HAD EVER SEEN
MR. PURCELL SUNBATHE,

13:47.257 --> 13:50.060
WELL, YOU'D KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT THAT TREE MEANS TO ME.

13:50.060 --> 13:53.003
(all laugh nervously)

13:53.003 --> 13:56.006
WELL, I DON'T WANT TO QUARREL.
WE WILL NOT TOUCH THAT TREE

13:56.006 --> 13:58.939
UNTIL WE HAVE COME UP WITH
A SOLUTION TO OUR PROBLEM.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.871
CURTAINS, PERHAPS.

14:02.342 --> 14:05.876
SO YOU'RE BACK. HOW FUN.
(laughs)

14:05.876 --> 14:07.847
I SHOULD HAVE A BRUNCH

14:07.847 --> 14:10.180
SO THAT EVERYONE
CAN GET TO KNOW YOU.

14:10.180 --> 14:12.182
NO, NO NEED. I'M HAVING
A BARBECUE THIS SATURDAY.

14:12.182 --> 14:14.184
I'M INVITING
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD.

14:14.184 --> 14:16.887
OH, YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.
 I INSIST.

14:16.887 --> 14:18.889
I HAVE MISSED WISTERIA LANE
SO MUCH,

14:18.889 --> 14:22.132
AND I WANNA DO SOMETHING SPECIAL
FOR MY DEAR, OLD FRIENDS...

14:22.132 --> 14:24.194
AND ALL YOU LOVELY NEWCOMERS.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.879
(lowered voice) THE NICE THING
ABOUT THIS FAKE PREGNANCY

14:39.879 --> 14:41.551
IS MY FEET DON'T SWELL.

14:41.551 --> 14:42.913
HMM.

14:42.913 --> 14:46.056
I MEAN, I'D NEVER BE ABLE TO
SQUEEZE INTO THESE SLING-BACKS

14:46.056 --> 14:48.618
IF I REALLY WAS
8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT.

14:50.360 --> 14:51.922
(gasps) BREE!

14:51.922 --> 14:54.394
DON'T YOU LOOK RADIANT!

14:54.394 --> 14:56.526
WELL, HELLO, MRS. McKEEVER.

14:56.526 --> 14:58.528
WELL, I HEARD
THAT YOU WERE EXPECTING,

14:58.528 --> 15:00.971
BUT I HAD NO IDEA
HOW FAR ALONG YOU WERE.

15:00.971 --> 15:02.302
MAY I?

15:02.302 --> 15:04.674
(gasps) OH!
THERE'S NO NEED. (chuckles)

15:04.674 --> 15:06.906
THE BABY'S
JUST NOT KICKING RIGHT NOW.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.908
SOMETIMES, IF YOU GIVE THEM
A LITTLE JIGGLE,

15:08.908 --> 15:10.680
YOU CAN GET THEM TO MOVE.

15:10.680 --> 15:13.043
OH!
 OH, SHE DOESN'T REALLY
WANNA BE JIGGLED RIGHT NOW.

15:13.043 --> 15:16.046
SHE'S VERY SENSITIVE
DOWN THERE.
 BUT I'LL BE GENTLE.

15:16.046 --> 15:17.547
YOU KNOW, IN MY DAY,

15:17.547 --> 15:20.450
MOTHERS THOUGHT
THAT IT WAS GOOD LUCK.

15:20.450 --> 15:24.024
PERHAPS I NEED TO MAKE MY POINT
A LITTLE MORE CLEARLY.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.126
BREE, YOU'RE HURTING ME!

15:26.126 --> 15:27.998
IS THERE A PROBLEM HERE?

15:27.998 --> 15:29.459
NO, NOT AT ALL!

15:29.459 --> 15:32.932
I'M JUST SAYING HELLO
TO A VERY DEAR FRIEND OF MINE.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.239
(whispers)
ARE YOU GONNA BACK OFF NOW?

15:39.239 --> 15:42.012
(whimpering)

15:42.012 --> 15:43.513
CAR'S HERE, DEAR.

15:43.513 --> 15:45.515
LOVELY TO SEE YOU,
MRS. McKEEVER.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.479
WHY MUST OLD LADIES
ALWAYS DO THAT?!

15:49.479 --> 15:52.482
I DON'T KNOW, BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO STOP ROUGHING THEM UP.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.357
I'M SORRY, SUSAN.

15:57.357 --> 15:59.359
DR. GORENBERG JUST HAD
A PATIENT GO INTO LABOR.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.431
HIS NEW PARTNER
IS COVERING FOR HIM,

16:01.431 --> 16:03.663
IF YOU'RE
COMFORTABLE WITH THAT.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.296
SURE. I'M JUST HERE
FOR A CHECKUP.

16:06.296 --> 16:07.967
DOCTOR?

16:07.967 --> 16:09.699
THANK YOU.
 SURE.

16:09.699 --> 16:11.641
HI. I'M DR. MAYFAIR.

16:11.641 --> 16:14.074
I'M GONNA...

16:14.074 --> 16:16.146
HOLD IT. HAVE WE MET?

16:16.146 --> 16:18.048
YES. YESTERDAY.

16:18.048 --> 16:19.349
SUSAN MAYER.

16:19.349 --> 16:21.051
YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR.

16:21.051 --> 16:22.212
RIGHT.

16:22.212 --> 16:25.585
I-I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE...
THIS KIND OF DOCTOR. (laughs)

16:25.585 --> 16:27.387
I SURE AM.

16:32.162 --> 16:34.624
LISTEN, UM...

16:34.624 --> 16:36.466
MAYBE THIS ISN'T--

16:36.466 --> 16:38.768
FEET UP, PLEASE.
 OKAY.

16:41.201 --> 16:43.373
AND SCOOTCH DOWN.

16:49.639 --> 16:54.044
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S WEIRD,
YOU KNOW, CONSIDERING YOU'RE...

16:54.044 --> 16:56.086
WHERE'D YOU GO?

16:56.086 --> 16:59.089
(whimpers)

16:59.089 --> 17:01.451
AND RELAX.

17:01.451 --> 17:04.723
UH... SORRY.

17:06.256 --> 17:07.597
AND RELAX.

17:07.597 --> 17:09.529
(inhales sharply)

17:09.529 --> 17:11.231
(whispers) SORRY.

17:11.231 --> 17:14.134
AND RELAX.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.305
SORRY.

17:15.305 --> 17:17.307
UM, HEY,
NOT TO CHANGE THE SUBJECT,

17:17.307 --> 17:19.608
BUT WHEN IS DR. GORENBERG
COMING BACK?

17:19.608 --> 17:21.540
ALMOST DONE.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.041
(exhales deeply)

17:23.041 --> 17:26.546
YOU KNOW, KATHERINE HAS
TALKED ABOUT YOU FOR YEARS.

17:26.546 --> 17:30.550
IT'S NICE TO FINALLY
PUT A FACE TO THE NAME.

17:33.383 --> 17:34.524
(whimpers)

17:46.096 --> 17:48.098
LYNETTE!

17:48.098 --> 17:51.241
MURIEL. HOW ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT'S UP?

17:51.241 --> 17:53.143
YOU LOOKGOOD.

17:53.143 --> 17:56.075
DON'T TRY TO SWEET-TALK ME,
LYNETTE SCAVO.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.077
I AM FIT TO BE TIED.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.410
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT

18:00.410 --> 18:02.582
VOLUNTEER TO RUN
THE FUND-RAISING GALA?

18:02.582 --> 18:05.315
YEAH. THINGS HAVE BEEN
A LITTLE WEIRD LATELY--

18:05.315 --> 18:08.358
DON'T EVEN THINK OF WRIGGLING
OUT OF THIS, LYNETTE.

18:08.358 --> 18:11.191
EVERY OTHER THIRD GRADE MOM
HAS CHAIRED AN EVENT.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.863
IT IS YOUR TURN.

18:13.863 --> 18:15.395
OKAY.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.397
I'LL JUMP RIGHT ON IT.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.399
GREAT. OKAY.

18:21.201 --> 18:24.234
SEE... THAT'S WHERE
SOMEONE WITH HALF A BRAIN

18:24.234 --> 18:26.236
WOULD HAVE PLAYED
THE CANCER CARD.

18:26.236 --> 18:27.537
I CAN HANDLE IT.

18:27.537 --> 18:30.540
LIKE HELL. YOU'VE BEEN NAUSEOUS
ALL DAY FROM THE CHEMO.

18:30.540 --> 18:32.542
SHH!
 (whispers)
YOU SHOULDN'T EVEN BE HERE!

18:32.542 --> 18:34.244
IT'S MY LIFE.

18:34.244 --> 18:37.247
SOME STUPID DISEASE IS NOT
GONNA KEEP ME FROM LIVING IT.

18:37.247 --> 18:39.349
BESIDES,
PARKER'S EXPECTING TO SEE ME.

18:39.349 --> 18:41.291
HEY. HI.

18:41.291 --> 18:43.593
THERE. HE SAW YOU.

18:43.593 --> 18:46.125
WE'LL DUCK OUT
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO DOWN.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.598
HE'S GONNA BE
WATCHING FOR ME ALL DAY.

18:48.598 --> 18:52.131
HE'S ONE OF THE LEADS.
 HE'S FRIAR TUCK.
IT'S A THANKLESS ROLE.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.134
(piano playing)

18:58.438 --> 19:02.272
WELL,
EVERYTHING SEEMS NORMAL.

19:02.272 --> 19:05.515
BUT YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN
HAVING IRREGULAR PERIODS.

19:05.515 --> 19:08.147
YEAH. YOU KNOW,
ONE MONTH OFF, TWO MONTHS ON.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.819
THAT HAPPENS, RIGHT?

19:09.819 --> 19:12.252
EVER EXPERIENCE
NIGHT SWEATS?

19:12.252 --> 19:14.454
UM, SOMETIMES.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.456
BUT MIKE'S A BIG SPOONER.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.458
HE'S LIKE SLEEPING
WITH A HIBACHI.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.459
(both laugh)

19:19.459 --> 19:21.331
UM, HOW ABOUT HOT FLASHES?

19:21.331 --> 19:24.234
OKAY, WHOA.
I'M GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT THERE.

19:24.234 --> 19:27.197
I AM WAY TOO YOUNG FOR THAT.
PLEASE REFER TO YOUR CHART.

19:27.197 --> 19:29.369
SUSAN,
I KNOW FOR A LOT OF WOMEN

19:29.369 --> 19:31.201
THE WORD "MENOPAUSE"
HAS NEGATIVE CONNOTATIONS.

19:31.201 --> 19:33.743
THEY HEAR, UM, "AGING,"

19:33.743 --> 19:37.207
"BRITTLE BONES,"
UM, "LOSS OF SEXUAL DESIRE."
 OKAY,
BEFORE WE GO ANY FURTHER,

19:37.207 --> 19:38.578
CAN I CHECK THOSE DIPLOMAS?

19:38.578 --> 19:40.580
'CAUSE I WOULD JUST
LIKE TO MAKE SURE

19:40.580 --> 19:43.583
THAT THEY'RE NOT FROM SOME
MED SCHOOL IN THE PHILIPPINES.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.585
LOOK,
THERE'S A SIMPLE BLOOD TEST

19:45.585 --> 19:48.218
WE CAN USE TO FIND OUT.
 I DON'T NEED ANY TEST!

19:48.218 --> 19:50.390
I AM NOT OLD ENOUGH
FOR MENOPAUSE.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.393
NOW I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF
NONSENSE THEY TAUGHT YOU AT...

19:53.393 --> 19:54.894
HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL,

19:54.894 --> 19:57.697
CLASS OF... '97?!

19:57.697 --> 20:00.730
OH, MY GOD! IAMOLD!

20:00.730 --> 20:02.932
JUST GIVE ME THE DAMN TEST.

20:05.375 --> 20:07.877
(boy) WE WILL LIVE IN THESE
WOODS TILL OUR WORK IS DONE.

20:07.877 --> 20:09.539
IF THE SHERIFF COMES,

20:09.539 --> 20:14.213
WE WILL DRIVE HIM AWAY
WITH OUR BOWS AND ARROWS.

20:14.213 --> 20:15.615
YOU OKAY?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.287
I'M FEELING A LITTLE...

20:17.287 --> 20:20.720
(Parker)
GOD SAVE ALL YE MERRY MEN!
 I'M FINE.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.523
I BESEECH THEE!
PRAY THAT I MAY JOIN YOUR MAN--

20:23.523 --> 20:25.525
BAND OF MERRY MEN.
 (giggles)

20:25.525 --> 20:28.227
I AM MORE
THAN JUST A JOLLY FRIAR,

20:28.227 --> 20:31.931
FOR I CAN HAVE
BOTH A SWORDANDAN ARROW!

20:31.931 --> 20:35.335
WE MUST SUPPORT ROBIN HOOD...
 OH, I'M GONNA BE SICK!

20:35.335 --> 20:37.767
RIGHT THERE WITH YOU,
LADY.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.969
ALL HAIL ROBIN HOOD!

20:39.969 --> 20:42.912
(applause)

20:42.912 --> 20:45.875
OKAY, LET'S GO.
 NO! IT'S TOO LATE!

20:45.875 --> 20:49.479
(retches)

20:52.251 --> 20:54.253
OH! (exhales deeply)

20:54.253 --> 20:55.855
BRAVO!

20:57.487 --> 21:00.560
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I'LL GET YOU A NEW PURSE.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.892
FINE,
BUT THAT WASN'T MY PURSE.

21:20.350 --> 21:22.652
(Katherine) HELLO.
YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU NEED?

21:22.652 --> 21:24.384
YOU JUST LET ME KNOW.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.856
HI! GOOD TO SEE YOU!
OH, YOU LOOK GREAT!

21:26.856 --> 21:30.320
MRS. McCLUSKEY. HELLO.

21:31.521 --> 21:34.594
(loudly) HOW ARE YOU?
DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

21:34.594 --> 21:38.428
YOU'RE BESS TRUMAN, RIGHT?
OF COURSE I REMEMBER YOU.

21:38.428 --> 21:41.431
IF THAT'S YOUR WAY OF CHECKING
IF MY BRAIN'S GONE ALL TAPIOCA,

21:41.431 --> 21:42.902
I'M FINE.
 (laughs) SORRY.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.405
SO I SAW YOUR KID
AND YOUR NEW HUSBAND.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.407
NICE CATCH.
 OH. WELL, THANK YOU.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.609
I'M VERY EAGER FOR HIM

21:49.609 --> 21:51.611
TO EXPERIENCE LIFE
ON WISTERIA LANE.

21:51.611 --> 21:53.943
THE TIMES THAT
DYLAN AND I SPENT HERE

21:53.943 --> 21:55.945
WERE THE HAPPIEST
OF OUR LIVES.
 YEAH?

21:55.945 --> 21:58.017
MM-HMM.
 THEN WHY'D YOU TAKE OFF
SO SUDDENLY?

21:58.017 --> 22:00.790
YOU SKIPPED TOWN
WITHOUT EVEN SAYING GOOD-BYE.

22:00.790 --> 22:03.593
MY, YOUDOREMEMBER A LOT,
DON'T YOU? (chuckles)

22:03.593 --> 22:04.924
HMM.

22:04.924 --> 22:07.397
EXCUSE ME.
REALLY MUST MINGLE.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.531
(sniffs)

22:12.932 --> 22:15.835
I THINK THESE EGGS
ARE PAST THEIR PRIME.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.638
OH.

22:18.638 --> 22:21.340
SO YOU JUST SHUN THEM
AND THROW THEM AWAY.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.642
WELL, YEAH,

22:22.642 --> 22:26.816
SINCE MAYONNAISE LEFT OUT
IN THE SUN CAN KILL YA.

22:26.816 --> 22:29.849
EVERYTHING OKAY?
YOU SEEM KINDA MOODY TODAY.

22:29.849 --> 22:31.851
YEAH, GET USED TO IT.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.524
OKAY,
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

22:34.524 --> 22:37.827
NO. I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST A LITTLE...

22:37.827 --> 22:40.530
YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET IT.
LET'S EAT.

22:40.530 --> 22:42.392
(Ida) YOO-HOO, SUSAN!

22:42.392 --> 22:44.834
WE SAVED YOU A PLACE!

22:44.834 --> 22:47.066
(woman) COME ON!

22:47.066 --> 22:49.068
WE WANT YOU OVER HERE.
 COME ON.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.071
(sobbing)

22:53.973 --> 22:57.076
OH, MY GOD! DYLAN!

22:58.808 --> 22:59.909
HI.

22:59.909 --> 23:01.411
IT'S ME... JULIE.

23:01.411 --> 23:03.913
JULIE'S THE ONE
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

23:03.913 --> 23:05.715
HI, HONEY!
 HI!

23:05.715 --> 23:07.987
SHE WAS YOUR BEST FRIEND.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.460
YEAH, AND I-I BROUGHT YOU
A LITTLE WELCOME BACK GIFT.

23:10.460 --> 23:13.423
YOUR FAVORITE.
 OH, MY GOODNESS.

23:13.423 --> 23:15.425
YOU REMEMBER HOW MUCH
YOU USED TO LOVE LICORICE?

23:15.425 --> 23:17.627
I DID?
 MM-HMM.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.529
OKAY.

23:21.531 --> 23:25.535
COME ON. I'VE GOT SOME OF
THE OLD GANG I WANT YOU TO MEET.

23:25.535 --> 23:27.607
HAVE FUN!

23:27.607 --> 23:29.439
(sighs)
 MENOPAUSE?

23:29.439 --> 23:31.441
AREN'T YOU
A LITTLE YOUNG FOR THAT?

23:31.441 --> 23:32.812
I KNOW.

23:32.812 --> 23:35.815
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU MARRIED
A VIBRANT WOMAN IN HER PRIME,

23:35.815 --> 23:39.489
AND INSTEAD,
YOU GOT A WIFE WHO'S...

23:39.489 --> 23:41.190
(voice breaks)
DRY AND DUSTY.

23:41.190 --> 23:42.852
(laughs) OH, HONEY.

23:42.852 --> 23:45.555
NO, IT'S--IT'S
A NATURAL PART OF LIFE.

23:45.555 --> 23:48.027
YEAH, THE PART BEFORE DEATH.
OH!

23:48.027 --> 23:49.959
LOOK,
I KNOW THAT IT'S UPSETTING,

23:49.959 --> 23:52.031
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT
THAT BIG A DEAL.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.163
YES, IT IS!
WHAT IF YOU WANNA HAVE KIDS?

23:54.163 --> 23:57.467
WE AGREED THAT WE DIDN'T.
 NO, YOU SAID YOU DID.
I SAID I DIDN'T,

23:57.467 --> 24:00.670
THEN YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.
WHAT IF YOU CHANGE IT BACK?
 THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.171
LISTEN, MY LAST EGG

24:02.171 --> 24:04.944
COULD BE ON ITS WAY DOWN
THE CHUTE AT THIS VERY MOMENT.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.946
IF YOU WANNA HAVE KIDS,

24:06.946 --> 24:09.579
YOU MIGHT WANNA
JUMP ON IT RIGHT NOW.

24:09.579 --> 24:11.581
ALL RIGHT, THIS IS ALL
VERY ROMANTIC,

24:11.581 --> 24:14.524
BUT LET ME
BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

24:14.524 --> 24:16.455
I LOVE YOU,

24:16.455 --> 24:19.529
AND IF KIDS DON'T HAPPEN,
I'M FINE WITH THAT.

24:19.529 --> 24:21.961
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO BE FINE.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.963
I WANT YOU TO BE HAPPY.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.465
ALL RIGHT,
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIND

24:26.465 --> 24:28.968
A NICE WAY
TO SHUT YOU UP, SO...

24:33.002 --> 24:34.504
(sighs)

24:34.504 --> 24:37.046
(crying) YEP, WE'RE DOOMED.

24:37.046 --> 24:39.649
(sighs)

24:39.649 --> 24:40.980
HEY.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.052
HEY, LOOK WHO'S BACK.

24:43.052 --> 24:46.786
(Susan) OH, MY GOSH.
SHE'S OUT OF THE CLINIC.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.819
THANKS, DARLING.

24:49.819 --> 24:51.160
HI!

24:51.160 --> 24:53.523
HI!
 HOW ARE YOU?

24:53.523 --> 24:55.094
OH, CAREFUL--THE NECK.
 WHAT?

24:55.094 --> 24:56.596
OH! OH, SORRY. SORRY.

24:56.596 --> 24:59.068
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
FOR THE CARDS.

24:59.068 --> 25:01.070
SOMETIMES IT TAKES
A NEAR TRAGEDY

25:01.070 --> 25:04.003
TO REALIZE
JUST HOW MUCH YOU'RE LOVED.
 (Lynette) AW.

25:04.003 --> 25:06.505
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TALK TO YOUR FRIENDS,

25:06.505 --> 25:09.539
AND I'LL GO UNPACK THE CAR?

25:09.539 --> 25:11.611
OH, THANKS, SWEETHEART.

25:11.611 --> 25:14.243
I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I WAS...

25:14.243 --> 25:17.687
A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT
HOW YOU'D REACT WHEN YOU SAW ME.

25:17.687 --> 25:18.888
BUT THIS...

25:18.888 --> 25:21.551
THROWING ME A PARTY? I...
(clicks tongue)

25:24.694 --> 25:26.996
WELL... WE JUST ALL LOVE YA.
 (laughs)

25:26.996 --> 25:29.599
AND, EDIE, YOU LOOK GREAT.
 (Bree) MM-HMM.

25:29.599 --> 25:30.600
ESPECIALLY...

25:30.600 --> 25:32.562
YOU KNOW,
GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

25:32.562 --> 25:35.104
YOU MEAN
THAT I TRIED TO HANG MYSELF.

25:35.104 --> 25:36.836
(chuckles) IT'S OKAY.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.108
THE DOCTOR ENCOURAGED ME
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

25:39.108 --> 25:41.871
SURELY NOT OVER FOOD.

25:41.871 --> 25:44.043
WELL, CARLOS AND I
TALK ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME.

25:44.043 --> 25:46.045
YOU KNOW,
AND THIS WHOLE THING

25:46.045 --> 25:48.547
HAS JUST BROUGHT US
CLOSER TOGETHER.

25:48.547 --> 25:50.049
WE'VE ACTUALLY
TALKED ABOUT MARRIAGE.

25:50.049 --> 25:52.081
(gasps)

25:52.081 --> 25:54.724
(chuckles nervously)

25:54.724 --> 25:57.126
HELLO.
I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.

25:57.126 --> 25:59.789
UM...
 I'M KATHERINE MAYFAIR,
YOUR NEW NEIGHBOR.

25:59.789 --> 26:02.692
OH, EDIE.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

26:02.692 --> 26:04.734
WELCOME TO MY PARTY.

26:10.339 --> 26:12.842
SO I HEAR CONGRATULATIONS
ARE IN ORDER.

26:12.842 --> 26:15.705
EDIE JUST ANNOUNCED YOU'RE
GETTING MARRIED. BEST WISHES!

26:15.705 --> 26:17.576
WE'RE NOT ENGAGED.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.810
THAT WAS JUST A KIND OF
A "WHAT IF" CONVERSATION.

26:20.810 --> 26:23.683
REALLY? BECAUSESHETHINKS
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

26:23.683 --> 26:26.716
EVERYONE ELSE THINKS
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED.

26:26.716 --> 26:29.759
SO, AGAIN, BEST WISHES.
 GABY, THE WOMAN TRIED TO KILL
HERSELF BECAUSE I LEFT HER.

26:29.759 --> 26:32.762
SHE'S NOT REAL GOOD
WITH DISAPPOINTMENT.
 NEITHER AM I!

26:32.762 --> 26:34.764
YOU TOLD ME
YOU WANNA RUN AWAY TOGETHER,

26:34.764 --> 26:37.767
AND THEN I DON'T
HEAR FROM YOU FOR A MONTH!
 THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE

26:37.767 --> 26:40.599
I WAS GOING THROUGH STUFF
WITH EDIE, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN

26:40.599 --> 26:43.232
THAT I WASN'T THINKING
ABOUT YOU CONSTANTLY.
 (scoffs) YOU WERE NOT.

26:43.232 --> 26:46.335
YES, I WAS.
EVERY SECOND OF EVERY DAY.

26:48.838 --> 26:53.242
YEAH, WELL, I... KIND OF
THOUGHT ABOUT YOU, TOO.

26:53.242 --> 26:56.615
I NEED TO BE WITH YOU, GABY.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.688
YEAH? PROVE IT.

26:58.688 --> 27:00.319
CAN YOU GET AWAY TONIGHT?

27:00.319 --> 27:02.621
OH, MY GOD,
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

27:02.621 --> 27:04.153
DAMN RIGHT I AM.

27:04.153 --> 27:05.955
OOH!

27:05.955 --> 27:08.798
MMM. MMM.

27:08.798 --> 27:11.300
I JUST HAVE TO BE BACK
BY MIDNIGHT

27:11.300 --> 27:14.303
TO GIVE EDIE HER PILLS.
 WHAT?!

27:14.303 --> 27:17.306
IF WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN AFFAIR,
WE'VE GOTTA BE DISCREET.
 AFFAIR?

27:17.306 --> 27:20.109
I THOUGHT WE WERE TALKING
ABOUT RUNNING AWAY TOGETHER.

27:20.109 --> 27:23.012
I CAN'T DO THAT.
EDIE'S TOO FRAGILE RIGHT NOW.

27:23.012 --> 27:26.015
THAT OLD BATTLE-AX
IS GONNA OUTLIVE US ALL!

27:26.015 --> 27:28.417
HEY, DON'T TALK ABOUT HER
LIKE THAT.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.419
OH, FAR BE IT FOR ME

27:30.419 --> 27:32.922
TO SPEAK ILL OF
THE FUTURE MRS. CARLOS SOLIS.

27:32.922 --> 27:35.424
WE ARE NOT GETTING MARRIED!
 BEST WISHES!

27:44.663 --> 27:46.665
(indistinct conversations)

27:46.665 --> 27:48.267
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

27:48.267 --> 27:51.941
THAT'S MY FINAL ANSWER.

27:51.941 --> 27:53.703
WELL, TALK TO YOU LATER.

27:53.703 --> 27:55.705
THAT WAS DANIELLE.

27:55.705 --> 27:58.177
NOW SHE WANTS US TO SEND
A DVD PLAYER FOR HER ROOM.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.810
WELL, THAT HARDLY SEEMS
EXTRAVAGANT.
 YOU'RE MISSING THE POINT!

28:00.810 --> 28:02.812
IT'S A CONVENT,
NOT THE FOUR SEASONS.

28:02.812 --> 28:05.114
YOU HAVE MUSTARD
ON YOUR CHIN.

28:05.114 --> 28:07.957
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING
TO FORGIVE BAD BEHAVIOR.

28:07.957 --> 28:10.760
IT'S ANOTHER THING
TO REWARD IT.

28:10.760 --> 28:13.823
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES
FOR HER MISTAKES.
 OH! BREE!

28:13.823 --> 28:16.395
OH, MY GOD!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?!

28:16.395 --> 28:18.968
OH! NO, NO, I'M FINE!
I'M FINE!

28:18.968 --> 28:22.972
YOU'RE BLEEDING!
 NO, NO, NO! IT'S JUST, UH--OH,
IT'S A LITTLE BARBECUE SAUCE.

28:22.972 --> 28:25.474
WHERE IS KATHERINE'S HUSBAND?
HE'S A DOCTOR.

28:25.474 --> 28:27.106
SHE'S FINE.
 ADAM!

28:27.106 --> 28:29.478
ADAM!
GET OVER HERE RIGHT NOW!

28:29.478 --> 28:31.981
BREE GOT STABBED IN THE BELLY!

28:31.981 --> 28:34.744
OH, MY GOD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
 NO, IT'S NOTHING!

28:34.744 --> 28:38.818
AH, UH, WE WERE JUST TEASING
IDA. IT'S SOMETHING WE DO.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.820
YES. (laughs nervously)

28:40.820 --> 28:44.153
LOOK, IT'S A...
TRICK BA--BARBECUE FORK.

28:44.153 --> 28:46.425
WE GOT IT AT A MAGIC SHOP.
UH, SEE?

28:46.425 --> 28:48.758
OH! OH!
 RETRACTABLE!

28:48.758 --> 28:50.830
OH! OH, MY BABY!

28:50.830 --> 28:52.131
(both laugh nervously)

28:52.131 --> 28:54.764
WOW.
THAT'S QUITE A TRICK.

28:54.764 --> 28:57.837
(chuckles) HEY, LET'S GO
FREAK OUT MRS. McCLUSKEY.

28:57.837 --> 28:58.838
OH!
 HUH?

28:58.838 --> 28:59.939
(both laugh)

28:59.939 --> 29:01.440
HE'S SUCH A SCAMP.

29:08.317 --> 29:10.349
PSYCHO MOM AT 5:00.

29:10.349 --> 29:14.523
YOU SAY THE WORD, SHE GETS
A FACE FULL OF PIG BONES.

29:14.523 --> 29:16.455
AW, MY HERO.
 MMM.

29:16.455 --> 29:18.888
I CAN HANDLE HER.
 (groans)

29:18.888 --> 29:19.889
LYNETTE.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.430
MM.
 I JUST SPOKE WITH HELEN,

29:21.430 --> 29:24.263
AND IMAGINE MY SURPRISE
WHEN SHE TOLD ME

29:24.263 --> 29:26.896
THAT YOU'D NOT STARTED ON
THE DECORATIONS FOR THE GALA.

29:26.896 --> 29:29.168
I'MIN CHARGE
OF DECORATIONS?

29:29.168 --> 29:31.170
YES,
WHICH YOU WOULD'VE KNOWN

29:31.170 --> 29:33.973
HAD YOU BOTHERED
TO PICK UP THE PACKET.

29:36.876 --> 29:41.080
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

29:41.080 --> 29:42.952
OKAY.

29:42.952 --> 29:45.114
(giggles) PIGGYBACK, MOMMY.

29:45.114 --> 29:46.555
(sighs)

29:49.458 --> 29:51.460
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.
I'M JUST--

29:51.460 --> 29:54.023
I'M JUST TOO TIRED
RIGHT NOW.

29:54.023 --> 29:56.866
HERE, HONEY, I'LL GET YA.

29:56.866 --> 29:58.227
OOH!

29:58.227 --> 30:01.100
(grunts) YES!

30:01.100 --> 30:05.074
MOMMY HAS TO CONSERVE HER ENERGY
FOR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS.

30:06.936 --> 30:08.077
MWAH!

30:14.043 --> 30:16.545
WE ARENOTTHROWING IN THE TOWEL
OVER A MINOR MISHAP.

30:16.545 --> 30:19.048
HOW MANY MORE "MISHAPS"
ARE WE GONNA GET AWAY WITH?

30:19.048 --> 30:21.991
YESTERDAY, IT WAS AN OLD WOMAN
IN THE MACY'S SHOE DEPARTMENT.

30:21.991 --> 30:23.993
TODAY, A MAGIC FORK
IN THE BELLY.

30:23.993 --> 30:26.295
PRETTY SOON, THIS WHOLE CHARADE
WILL COMPLETELY UNRAVEL,

30:26.295 --> 30:29.228
AND WE WILL BE HUMILIATED.
 WE'RE ALREADY IN TOO DEEP.

30:29.228 --> 30:31.300
WE COULD GO ON A TRIP,

30:31.300 --> 30:34.934
TELL PEOPLE YOU MISCARRIED
WHILE WE WERE AWAY.
 AND THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
TO THE BABY?

30:34.934 --> 30:38.437
WELL, DANIELLE WOULD KEEP IT.
 YOU THINK DANIELLE
COULD RAISE THIS CHILD?

30:38.437 --> 30:40.910
ORSON, YOU'VE SEEN HER
IN ACTION.

30:40.910 --> 30:43.973
SHE'S--SHE'S SHALLOW,
AND SHE'S--SHE'S SELFISH!

30:43.973 --> 30:46.275
SHE WOULD RUIN
THIS CHILD'S LIFE!
 HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

30:46.275 --> 30:48.918
BECAUSE I'M HER MOTHER.

30:48.918 --> 30:53.122
AND I KNOW WHAT I'VE CREATED,
AND THAT'S THE REAL HUMILIATION.

30:56.025 --> 30:58.988
ORSON...

30:58.988 --> 31:02.091
THIS CHILD DESERVES BETTER.

31:02.091 --> 31:04.193
AND I KNOW WHAT TO DO NOW.

31:04.193 --> 31:08.167
PLEASE...
PLEASE LET ME TRY.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.901
SO...

31:11.901 --> 31:15.004
REALLY, WHAT YOU WANT
IS A SECOND CHANCE?

31:15.004 --> 31:18.507
WELL, WOULD THAT BE
SO HORRIBLE?

31:22.581 --> 31:24.183
WELL, THEN...

31:26.415 --> 31:29.919
LET THE CHARADE CONTINUE.

31:29.919 --> 31:31.220
OH.

31:31.220 --> 31:33.092
(chuckles)

31:33.092 --> 31:34.423
(kisses)

31:34.423 --> 31:35.965
HEY.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.029
SO YOU'RE BAILING ON ME NOW?

31:40.029 --> 31:42.031
I KNOW.
THE TIMING IS TERRIBLE.

31:42.031 --> 31:44.033
DAMN RIGHT! IT'S THREE WEEKS
BEFORE THE GALA.

31:44.033 --> 31:46.035
I JUST DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW TIRED I WOULD BE

31:46.035 --> 31:48.077
WHEN I TOOK THIS ON.
 OH, WE'REALLTIRED, LYNETTE.

31:48.077 --> 31:51.080
BUT SOME OF US STILL MANAGE
TO HONOR OUR COMMITMENTS.

31:51.080 --> 31:53.082
OKAY, I'M GONNA
BE HONEST WITH YOU.

31:53.082 --> 31:55.314
I HAVEN'T BEEN FEELING
THAT GREAT LATELY.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.387
OH, DON'T WHINE TO ME
ABOUT YOUR ACHES AND PAINS.

31:58.387 --> 32:00.389
I'VE HAD THE SAME MIGRAINE
SINCE '87.

32:00.389 --> 32:03.392
AND MY KNEE'S SO BAD, I CAN'T
EVEN USE THE TREADMILL ANYMORE.

32:03.392 --> 32:05.124
OH. YEAH.

32:05.124 --> 32:06.625
THAT'S ROUGH.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.657
HMM.

32:08.657 --> 32:10.659
BY THE WAY...

32:14.633 --> 32:17.436
I HAVE CANCER.

32:20.609 --> 32:22.611
I'LL GIVE HELEN A CALL.

32:22.611 --> 32:24.143
(papers crinkle)

32:32.651 --> 32:34.653
(exhales deeply)

32:36.255 --> 32:40.229
SO I AM
HALFWAY THROUGH CHEMO,

32:40.229 --> 32:43.062
AND MY DOCTOR IS VERY CONFIDENT

32:43.062 --> 32:47.166
THAT I'M GOING TO BEAT THIS,
SO YOU CAN ALL RELAX.

32:47.166 --> 32:50.039
I'M NOT GOING TO DIE.

32:54.743 --> 32:57.076
WELL,
NOT UNLESSWEKILL YOU.

32:57.076 --> 32:59.148
HUH?
 DAMN IT, LYNETTE.

32:59.148 --> 33:02.011
WHAT DID WE SAY
AFTER MARY ALICE... AFTER EDIE?

33:02.011 --> 33:04.013
"WHY DIDN'T THEY TELL US?"

33:04.013 --> 33:07.116
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
WHY WOULD YOU SHUT US OUT?

33:07.116 --> 33:11.190
I JUST LIKED
BEING ABLE TO THROW ON MY WIG

33:11.190 --> 33:13.692
AND JOIN YOU GUYS
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE

33:13.692 --> 33:16.195
AND A GOOD GOSSIP
ABOUT THE NEW NEIGHBORS.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.227
YOU KNOW, FOR FIVE MINUTES,

33:18.227 --> 33:21.130
I COULD PRETEND
I WASN'T A SICK PERSON.

33:21.130 --> 33:23.632
BUT ONCE YOUR FRIENDS
KNOW YOU'RE SICK,

33:23.632 --> 33:25.134
YOU CAN'T PRETEND ANYMORE

33:25.134 --> 33:28.637
'CAUSE YOU CAN SEE IT
IN THEIR EYES--

33:28.637 --> 33:32.010
THE FEAR, THE PITY.

33:32.010 --> 33:34.613
IS THAT ALL YOU SEE
IN OUR EYES?

33:41.490 --> 33:43.592
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

33:46.095 --> 33:49.098
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET'S MAKE A PACT.

33:49.098 --> 33:50.459
NO MORE SECRETS.

33:50.459 --> 33:53.062
FROM NOW ON,
WE TELL EACH OTHER

33:53.062 --> 33:57.066
EVERY SHOCKING DETAIL
OF OUR LIVES.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.770
I'M IN.

34:01.770 --> 34:04.173
ME, TOO.

34:05.674 --> 34:07.516
YOU WITH US?

34:09.318 --> 34:10.819
ABSOLUTELY.

34:13.282 --> 34:15.284
NO MORE SECRETS.

34:27.636 --> 34:32.070
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M NOT HAPPY.
LET'S TALK.

34:33.601 --> 34:36.605
ALL I'M SAYING IS

34:36.605 --> 34:39.608
I JUST WANNA KNOW
THAT I COME FIRST WITH YOU.

34:39.608 --> 34:42.811
SOMETIMES I FEEL LESS LIKE
YOUR WIFE THAN A POSSESSION.

34:42.811 --> 34:45.284
IT'S DEMEANING. IT'S--IT'S...

34:45.284 --> 34:48.117
WHY ARE YOU SMILING RIGHT NOW?
 BECAUSE THIS IS FANTASTIC.

34:48.117 --> 34:50.119
AFTER WEEKS
OF SHUTTING ME OUT,

34:50.119 --> 34:52.491
YOU'RE FINALLY TELLING ME
HOW YOU FEEL.

34:52.491 --> 34:55.194
WE SHOULD DO THIS
ALL THE TIME.

34:55.194 --> 34:58.597
WELL, IT'S HARD
WHEN YOU'RE SO BUSY.
 (sighs)

34:58.597 --> 35:00.599
MAYBE WE SHOULD GO AWAY

35:00.599 --> 35:03.572
AND JUST TAKE
A COUPLE WEEKS OR A MONTH.

35:03.572 --> 35:05.374
LET'S REDISCOVER WHAT IT WAS

35:05.374 --> 35:07.706
THAT MADE US FALL IN LOVE
TO BEGIN WITH.

35:07.706 --> 35:11.280
THAT IS A GREAT IDEA.
LET'S DO IT.

35:11.280 --> 35:13.142
HOW'S NEXT WEEK?

35:13.142 --> 35:15.684
LET'S SEE HERE.

35:15.684 --> 35:17.386
(clears throat)

35:17.386 --> 35:20.549
WELL, I'VE GOT THE MEETING WITH
THE SCHOOL BOARD ON TUESDAY...
 MM-HMM.

35:20.549 --> 35:22.551
AND THE END OF THE MONTH,

35:22.551 --> 35:25.554
I'VE GOT THAT CONFERENCE
IN WASHINGTON--OH, SHOOT.

35:25.554 --> 35:28.257
I'VE GOT THE GROUNDBREAKING
FOR THE NEW CIVIC CENTER...

35:28.257 --> 35:32.901
DAD'S BIRTHDAY...
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FORUM...

35:32.901 --> 35:34.403
HOW ABOUT APRIL?

35:34.403 --> 35:37.866
I CAN GIVE YOU
TWO WHOLE WEEKS IN APRIL.

35:40.609 --> 35:43.372
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, BABE.

35:43.372 --> 35:47.316
WHERE YOU GOING?
 TO SCAVO'S FOR A FEW BEERS.

35:47.316 --> 35:48.717
OH! CAN I COME?

35:48.717 --> 35:50.779
UH... NO.

35:50.779 --> 35:52.150
WHY NOT?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.653
EDIE, I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH A LOT LATELY,

35:54.653 --> 35:58.527
BUT I CAN'T HOLD YOUR HAND
24 HOURS A DAY.

35:58.527 --> 36:01.230
IF YOU WANT
THIS RELATIONSHIP TO WORK,

36:01.230 --> 36:03.532
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME
SOME DOWNTIME.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.796
(door closes)

36:12.201 --> 36:15.404
OKAY, SO I MANAGED
TO GET AWAY FROM EDIE.

36:15.404 --> 36:16.905
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

36:16.905 --> 36:19.908
TO GET YOU AWAY FROM EDIE.

36:30.419 --> 36:31.820
(grunts)

36:31.820 --> 36:33.822
OH, COME ON.

36:33.822 --> 36:36.325
YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER
YOUR "BOYFRIEND" JOEY MILLER.

36:36.325 --> 36:38.827
YOU USED TO CHASE HIM AROUND
THE JUNGLE GYM.

36:38.827 --> 36:41.330
REALLY? YOU'D THINK
I WOULD'VE GONE FOR THIS GUY

36:41.330 --> 36:43.832
WITH THE SEXY FINGER
UP HIS NOSE.
 (laughs)

36:43.832 --> 36:47.536
SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER ANY OF
THE KIDS WE USED TO PLAY WITH?

36:47.536 --> 36:49.238
NO. TO BE HONEST,

36:49.238 --> 36:53.312
I DON'T REMEMBER ANYTHING
ABOUT LIVING HERE.
 REALLY?

36:54.883 --> 36:58.947
SO... WHAT IS
YOUR EARLIEST MEMORY?

37:01.550 --> 37:05.994
I DON'T KNOW
IF THIS IS A MEMORY, BUT...

37:05.994 --> 37:08.627
FOR YEARS,
I'VE HAD THIS CREEPY DREAM.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.830
I'M REALLY LITTLE,

37:11.830 --> 37:14.903
AND THERE'S A GUY IN MY ROOM,

37:14.903 --> 37:17.336
AND HE TRIES TO GRAB ME.

37:17.336 --> 37:19.237
THATISCREEPY.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.470
HAVE--HAVE YOU EVER...

37:21.470 --> 37:24.343
TALKED TO SOMEBODY ABOUT IT?

37:24.343 --> 37:28.347
YOU MEAN LIKE A THERAPIST?
(chuckles)

37:28.347 --> 37:30.319
MY OLD BABYSITTER
SUGGESTED THAT,

37:30.319 --> 37:34.283
BUT MY MOM GOT MAD
AND SAID NO.

37:34.283 --> 37:36.254
REALLY?

37:36.254 --> 37:37.426
YEAH.

37:37.426 --> 37:40.589
THEN SHE FIRED
THE BABYSITTER.

37:46.395 --> 37:47.536
(Adam) SUSAN?

37:47.536 --> 37:49.037
I'M IN HERE.

37:49.037 --> 37:51.870
UH, YOUR FRONT DOOR
WAS OPEN.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.343
NO PROBLEM.

37:54.343 --> 37:56.405
UM, WHAT'S UP?

37:56.405 --> 37:58.276
FIRST, LET ME JUST SAY
THIS IS ONE OF

37:58.276 --> 38:00.278
THE MORE EMBARRASSING MOMENTS
OF MY CAREER,

38:00.278 --> 38:03.412
AND YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT
TO HATE ME.

38:03.412 --> 38:05.584
ADAM, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

38:05.584 --> 38:07.586
WELL, YOUR TEST RESULTS
CAME BACK,

38:07.586 --> 38:09.588
AND YOUR ESTROGEN LEVELS
ARE FINE.

38:09.588 --> 38:12.421
YOU'RE NOT ABOUT
TO START MENOPAUSE.

38:12.421 --> 38:14.393
REALLY? (laughs)
THAT'S FANTASTIC!

38:14.393 --> 38:15.724
THERE'S MORE.

38:15.724 --> 38:17.926
MORE?

38:17.926 --> 38:19.768
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

38:21.530 --> 38:26.405
WHAT?
WH-WHAT DID HE JUST SAY?

38:26.405 --> 38:27.536
I'M PREGNANT?

38:30.939 --> 38:32.781
HE SAID I'M PREGNANT.

38:34.813 --> 38:38.787
OH... (laughs)

38:38.787 --> 38:42.421
(both laughing)

38:43.552 --> 38:47.926
MMM!
I HAVENEVERBEEN HAPPIER.

38:47.926 --> 38:49.998
WELL,NOWI BELIEVE YOU.

38:49.998 --> 38:52.401
(laughs)

38:57.666 --> 38:59.968
THERE YOU ARE.

38:59.968 --> 39:01.710
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

39:01.710 --> 39:04.713
I GOT IN LATE LAST NIGHT.
I DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU.

39:04.713 --> 39:07.376
YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN.
I TRUST YOU.

39:07.376 --> 39:11.380
(chuckles) WELL, GOOD.
YOU SHOULD.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.682
I JUST WISH YOU
TRUSTEDMEA BIT MORE.

39:13.682 --> 39:15.684
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

39:15.684 --> 39:17.686
WHY DIDN'T YOU EVER TELL ME

39:17.686 --> 39:19.688
ABOUT YOUR OFFSHORE
BANK ACCOUNT?

39:21.860 --> 39:23.862
WHAT?

39:23.862 --> 39:25.534
WELL, YOU KNOW,

39:25.534 --> 39:28.797
THE ONE IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS
WITH $10 MILLION IN IT.

39:31.570 --> 39:35.003
I MISS YOU
WHEN YOU'RE GONE.

39:37.446 --> 39:38.747
GOING THROUGH YOUR THINGS

39:38.747 --> 39:41.480
MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE WITH ME.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.512
OKAY, UM,
I KNOW HOW THIS LOOKS.

39:43.512 --> 39:46.415
WHAT DID YOU THINK
I WAS GONNA DO?

39:46.415 --> 39:48.417
TELL PEOPLE? TURN YOU IN?

39:48.417 --> 39:51.420
TRY TO GET
MY LITTLE HANDS ON IT?

39:51.420 --> 39:54.893
I DON'T CARE ABOUT MONEY,
CARLOS.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.396
ALL I CARE ABOUT IS YOU.

39:58.396 --> 40:04.533
THAT'S WHY THIS RELATIONSHIP
 ISGOING TO WORK.

40:04.533 --> 40:07.906
YOU CAN TRUST ME
WITH YOUR SECRETS,

40:07.906 --> 40:10.509
JUST LIKE I CAN TRUST YOU

40:10.509 --> 40:12.841
NOT TO HURT ME.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.114
(chuckles)

40:24.553 --> 40:27.656
THERE IS A CERTAIN TIME
OF MORNING.

40:27.656 --> 40:30.629
IT OCCURS
AFTER KIDS HAVE LEFT FOR SCHOOL

40:30.629 --> 40:34.002
AND HUSBANDS HAVE HEADED OFF
FOR WORK.

40:34.002 --> 40:37.005
IT'S A TIME WHEN WOMEN
THINK OF THE SECRETS

40:37.005 --> 40:40.639
THEY'VE BEEN KEEPING
FROM THEIR FRIENDS...

40:40.639 --> 40:45.774
AND HOW SHOCKED THEY WOULD BE
IF THE TRUTH WAS DISCOVERED...

40:45.774 --> 40:48.647
AND HOW THEY'LL DO
EVERYTHING IN THEIR POWER

40:48.647 --> 40:51.449
TO KEEP THAT FROM HAPPENING.

40:51.449 --> 40:54.082
BUT WHAT OF THOSE LUCKY WOMEN

40:54.082 --> 40:56.825
WHO HAVE NO SECRETS
LEFT TO KEEP?

40:56.825 --> 40:59.558
WHAT DOTHEYTHINK ABOUT
EVERY MORNING?

40:59.558 --> 41:00.789
HEY!

41:03.131 --> 41:06.064
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

41:07.896 --> 41:09.668
IT'S JUST...

41:09.668 --> 41:13.071
DYLAN AND I
USED TO BE BEST FRIENDS.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.604
I MEAN,
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

41:15.604 --> 41:18.577
I KNOW.
SHE WAS LIKE A SISTER TO YOU.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.249
WELL...

41:21.249 --> 41:24.212
THAT GIRL THAT I'VE BEEN
HANGING OUT WITH...

41:24.212 --> 41:29.057
AND I KNOW THIS IS
GONNA SOUND CRAZY, BUT...

41:29.057 --> 41:31.119
THAT'S NOT THE SAME GIRL.

41:31.119 --> 41:33.662
(zips up backpack)

41:38.767 --> 41:40.769
THESE WOMEN
SPEND THEIR MORNINGS

41:40.769 --> 41:42.571
THINKING OF THEIR NEIGHBORS

41:42.571 --> 41:44.072
AND THE SECRETS...

41:44.072 --> 41:46.905
THEYMAY BE KEEPING.

41:55.283 --> 41:57.986
THERE YOU ARE.
I'VE BEEN CALLING YOU.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.626
IS THIS THE ROOM?

42:07.626 --> 42:10.028
YES.

42:10.028 --> 42:13.031
DYLAN'S BEEN ASKING ME
IF SHE CAN MOVE IN HERE.

42:13.031 --> 42:15.163
SO LET HER.

42:15.163 --> 42:18.166
YOU MAY REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED
HERE, BUT SHE CAN'T.

42:18.166 --> 42:19.908
DOESN'T MATTER.

42:19.908 --> 42:21.910
I WON'T ALLOW IT.

42:21.910 --> 42:24.713
HEY, YOU OKAY?

42:24.713 --> 42:27.215
DID WE MAKE A MISTAKE
COMING BACK HERE?

42:27.215 --> 42:30.548
DID WE HAVE A CHOICE?

42:43.932 --> 42:45.934
(lock clanks)
