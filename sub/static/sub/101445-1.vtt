If you're in trouble, just
light up your signal lamps,

02:29.250 --> 02:30.349
we'll show up.

02:30.351 --> 02:32.300
We're...

02:32.302 --> 02:34.252
The Firefly
Action Brigade.

02:36.790 --> 02:38.590
It's a dangerous world.

02:38.592 --> 02:41.660
But the Firefly Action
Brigade is here to help.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.296
Get your signal light ready
at the first sign of trouble.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.864
We got your back.

02:45.866 --> 02:49.301
Oh I can't resist the button.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.303
Resist, it's careless
bugs like you

02:51.305 --> 02:53.272
that give bugs a bad name.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.340
Well, it's not food.

02:56.744 --> 02:57.776
I'm a bug.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.411
Everything's food.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.521
You go.

03:09.523 --> 03:10.822
Let it follow me.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.824
Mama, mama.

03:14.562 --> 03:15.460
The signal light.

03:15.462 --> 03:16.695
Use it now!

03:19.667 --> 03:20.866
Look, I found it.

03:20.868 --> 03:21.767
Look out!

03:25.973 --> 03:27.839
Bugsy, look out.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.241
Bugsy.

03:44.491 --> 03:45.724
We've got a beamer.

03:45.726 --> 03:46.959
Time for action.

03:48.395 --> 03:50.395
Firefly Action Brigade.

03:50.397 --> 03:52.598
We're mission go!

03:54.001 --> 03:56.401
Everyone, to your bottle caps.

04:12.253 --> 04:14.353
I hope this is the
right direction

04:14.355 --> 04:16.355
because I can't stop!

04:24.932 --> 04:27.866
Mission objective reached.

04:27.868 --> 04:29.568
Dropping out of hyperspace.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.370
Target confirmed.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.437
Planet Earth.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.840
Hunters, prepare for invasion.

04:37.578 --> 04:38.910
Prepare for landing.

04:38.912 --> 04:41.680
Hone in on the
explorer's beacon.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.452
I see the light.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.820
Time for action.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.757
Looks like we're going
deep and dark this time.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.760
Just the way I like it.
Yahoo!

04:54.762 --> 04:56.962
Brightheart,
we talked about this.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.897
I should go first.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.565
No one's
stopping you.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.567
Get your robot butt down here.

05:02.569 --> 05:03.935
Hey, Fiona.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.804
I can watch your back.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.939
I'm a bullfrog in jet pack.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.443
It doesn't get any
better than this!

05:14.782 --> 05:16.281
Hey, Aurora.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.783
Any chance this thing can
go a little bit faster?

05:17.785 --> 05:18.984
Correct, Frog.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.769
It follows your thoughts.

05:21.771 --> 05:24.555
- You think fast, you go fast.
- Oh, I gotta think about it?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.958
There's a first time
for everything.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.529
I'm still not going fast enough.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.497
You're still not
thinking hard enough.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.799
Buzz off, Beetle.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.434
Keep your
eyes on the road.

05:38.706 --> 05:40.439
I'm blaming you for this.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.741
Oh I'm like a cork in a bottle.

05:42.743 --> 05:45.744
Brightheart, get me out of here.

05:45.746 --> 05:46.812
Again?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.714
Lightning bug booty kick.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.819
Now it's your turn.

05:53.821 --> 05:54.753
No need.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.722
I can be the lookout, right?

05:56.724 --> 05:58.123
Can you even see?

05:58.125 --> 06:01.760
What has 20 teeth
and likes to eat frogs?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.628
Better go.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.867
I guess it's my own
fault for being so tasty.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.370
I'll rescue you with
just my fingers.

06:12.373 --> 06:13.839
Here I come.

06:13.841 --> 06:15.874
I can feel my
butt getting eaten.

06:20.614 --> 06:23.382
Brightheart, no more
rescues, please.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.684
Aurora, do a scan.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.853
See where the
light signal came from.

06:30.524 --> 06:32.958
Life sign detected
in this direction.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.093
Rescue time!

06:37.965 --> 06:39.831
Brightheart, you're here.

06:39.833 --> 06:41.400
Please help me.

06:41.402 --> 06:42.501
Help me, help me.

06:42.503 --> 06:43.635
Don't be afraid.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.703
We've got this.

06:44.705 --> 06:48.407
Firefly Action Brigade,
bring it to me.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.709
Aurora, please lift
up that vine.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.078
Bubbles, use your
suit to pull him out.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.113
The rest of you,
build a stretcher.

07:03.456 --> 07:05.189
We need wood to build a
stretcher, help me, Albert.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.860
Oh my face.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.429
My gorgeous face.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.205
My baby.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.207
You've got to help him.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.009
You're in good hands, ma'am.

07:32.619 --> 07:33.919
Bugsy.

07:33.921 --> 07:35.787
Bugsy, are you okay?

07:35.789 --> 07:36.954
Bugsy?

07:36.956 --> 07:38.122
He's waking up.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.591
He's waking up.

07:39.593 --> 07:40.559
Bugsy.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.861
Oh, oh you're okay.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.696
Great
job, everyone.

07:44.698 --> 07:47.165
Let's just take him to the
hospital for a check up.

08:02.249 --> 08:03.782
Oh.

08:08.222 --> 08:09.955
It's them!

08:09.957 --> 08:12.691
The Firefly Action Brigade.

08:26.273 --> 08:29.207
Oh, such a beautiful light.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.676
Oh.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.216
And poof.

08:38.218 --> 08:40.519
The little moth was gone.

08:40.521 --> 08:41.887
Lost in the light.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.155
You want that to happen to you?

08:44.157 --> 08:46.024
Tell me the rules.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.159
What are your rules?

08:50.731 --> 08:52.197
What do you know?

08:53.667 --> 08:56.701
Don't
fly too far from home.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.937
Never fly into light.

09:01.575 --> 09:04.009
Don't talk
with your mouth full.

09:10.951 --> 09:13.985
We moths can't
resist the evil light.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.889
Some never learn this lesson.

09:31.572 --> 09:34.172
But you, what have you learned?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.810
Don't go into the light.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.011
Don't forget.

09:40.013 --> 09:42.080
Bad news, chief.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.682
We have trouble.

09:43.684 --> 09:46.651
Trouble in the village.

09:47.621 --> 09:49.955
Chief, Larvaboy.

09:49.957 --> 09:54.192
He, brought something
shiny to the village!

09:54.194 --> 09:55.827
He what?

10:11.378 --> 10:13.778
Get rid of
that thing now!

10:16.116 --> 10:17.616
But, Chief.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.185
This is a special
emergency signal light.

10:20.187 --> 10:24.756
Light the light and the Firefly
Action Brigade will come.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.258
They gave signal lights
to all the villages

10:27.260 --> 10:30.729
and if we light the light,
we'll be safe.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.397
Sparkling lights are a trap.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.032
Light won't save us.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.301
It will probably kill us.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.402
The whole tribe.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.703
Uh.

10:38.705 --> 10:42.007
Well, light doesn't
really kill us.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.276
Birds kill us and maybe
with the signal lights,

10:45.278 --> 10:47.145
maybe Brightheart can help us.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.214
Throw that thing away.

10:50.050 --> 10:51.282
Right now!

11:05.966 --> 11:07.265
Oh, look, Chief.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.266
It works.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.935
The signal light is so bright.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.871
Everyone can see it.

11:16.710 --> 11:18.143
Chief, the light.

11:18.145 --> 11:21.079
Oh, it's so beautiful.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.314
Don't look at it.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.918
The light is bad luck.

11:26.920 --> 11:30.455
But the moon is also a light.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.158
I'm trying to protect
you from the lights.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.461
As long as the moon stays
in the sky, I got no beef,

11:36.463 --> 11:39.431
but all other
light is pure evil.

11:39.433 --> 11:42.901
I'm trying to protect
you from the lights.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.469
See, bad luck.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.970
Everyone inside.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.750
Into the cave.

11:59.820 --> 12:01.820
Run, run!

12:03.290 --> 12:05.990
Close it, close it now!

12:10.897 --> 12:12.297
Someones in trouble.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.148
Wait, Aurora.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.233
What happened to the signal?

12:15.235 --> 12:19.037
Data from the signal
indicates a moth larva

12:19.039 --> 12:21.206
has been caught by an owl.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.274
Oh, that's not good.

12:23.276 --> 12:25.343
Owls are all beaks and
class and appetites.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.978
And we're it's favorite food.

12:26.980 --> 12:28.246
What if--

12:28.248 --> 12:30.482
Never fear, Solomon's here.

12:30.484 --> 12:33.184
Nothing can keep
me from your side, babe.

12:34.321 --> 12:37.322
Predator
alert just ahead.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.397
Don't eat me!

12:46.399 --> 12:47.932
Don't eat me!

12:47.934 --> 12:49.834
I have homework to do!

13:21.835 --> 13:22.934
I've got this.

13:22.936 --> 13:23.835
You go.

13:30.043 --> 13:31.376
Maybe I don't have this.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.450
Heads up, bird brain.

13:39.452 --> 13:41.219
You're on our turf now.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.987
Eat a little too much lunch?

13:54.234 --> 13:57.335
You're the Firefly
Action Brigade.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.037
Thank you for helping me.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.606
I'm Larvaboy from
the moth village

14:01.608 --> 14:04.442
and you really
can rescue anybody.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.044
I saw your bright light.

14:06.046 --> 14:08.012
How do you do that?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.383
Light on back.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.554
Whoa, so cool.

14:20.026 --> 14:21.292
What's wrong?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.194
Need something more spectacular?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.296
Aurora, let's milk this one.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.931
Lead me in.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.505
Not exactly what I had in mind.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.374
You said you wanted to milk it.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.243
It's not just that.

14:38.245 --> 14:42.647
The chief, the chief he believes
that all lights are evil.

14:42.649 --> 14:44.048
Light can't be evil.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.884
That's crazy.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.353
Yeah, that's exactly
what I told him, too.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.054
Maybe I should try?

14:51.057 --> 14:52.457
Where is your village?

14:54.227 --> 14:55.460
Huh?

14:55.996 --> 14:57.595
Huh?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.502
Come on,

15:05.504 --> 15:07.537
Please don't cry.

15:07.540 --> 15:09.140
Can't you see?

15:09.142 --> 15:10.341
I'm trying to protect you.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.676
I'm not the bad guy.

15:11.678 --> 15:14.612
The lights, the lights
are the real enemy.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.682
We will black
out all the lights.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.250
Listen up.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.519
The god of moonlight is angry.

15:21.521 --> 15:26.090
Black out the lights!

15:26.092 --> 15:29.560
The only good
light is a bad light.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.076
When you dropped
the signal light,

15:45.078 --> 15:48.046
I wanted to use it to
bring you to our village.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.715
As you can see,
we have a bird problem.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.051
We have to do
something to keep it

15:53.053 --> 15:56.321
from using our village as
it's own personal restaurant.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.223
The Firefly Action Brigade
is officially on the job.

15:59.225 --> 16:01.059
How you gonna do it?

16:01.061 --> 16:02.694
How you gonna beat the bird?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.196
Our methods are on
a need to know basis.

16:05.198 --> 16:07.332
Which means that we
don't even know ourselves

16:07.334 --> 16:08.566
Until we do it.

16:08.568 --> 16:11.369
Wow, top secret stuff.

16:11.371 --> 16:12.971
Yeah, something like that.

16:12.973 --> 16:15.006
Alert, incoming bugs.

16:17.177 --> 16:18.242
It's the Chief!

16:18.244 --> 16:22.013
Hey Chief, I didn't get eaten.

16:22.015 --> 16:22.680
What?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.616
Is that, Larvaboy?

16:30.090 --> 16:32.991
Huh, I thought he'd
be bird poop by now.

16:32.993 --> 16:36.394
Chief, those are the guys
that made the shiny lights.

16:36.396 --> 16:37.595
What?

16:37.597 --> 16:40.498
It looks like Larvaboy
has betrayed us.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.733
Battle stations.

16:42.736 --> 16:44.235
What?

16:44.237 --> 16:45.737
They're welcoming
committee has such style.

16:45.739 --> 16:47.472
We have to step up our game.

16:47.474 --> 16:49.490
We have to show 'em,

16:49.492 --> 16:51.509
show 'em that the Firefly
Action Brigade has style, too.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.212
Firefly Action
Brigade, assemble.

16:56.282 --> 16:58.249
Chief, they're going to attack.

16:58.251 --> 16:59.317
Charge!

17:00.754 --> 17:02.620
Is that how moths say hello?

17:05.225 --> 17:06.290
No!

17:06.292 --> 17:08.459
But they saved me.

17:09.362 --> 17:10.528
They're here to help us.

17:10.530 --> 17:11.696
You're brainwashed.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.498
They brought the shiny lights.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.367
They must be our real enemies.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.570
What did I ever do to
you? Stop poking at me.

17:22.675 --> 17:23.708
Secret weapons.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.443
Take no prisoners.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.612
Seriously?

17:29.082 --> 17:31.049
This is your idea of a welcome?

17:31.051 --> 17:33.084
You're gonna have to
do better than that!

17:33.086 --> 17:35.553
Albert, teach them a lesson.

17:46.266 --> 17:47.398
Over here.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.634
Take out the one
with the shining butt.

17:49.636 --> 17:52.703
Huh, Aurora, help!

17:52.705 --> 17:54.105
Don't let them escape.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.840
Let's all go together.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.708
Ready?

17:57.710 --> 17:59.577
Together,
together, together.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.481
A trick.

18:03.483 --> 18:04.582
It's a trick.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.417
We need insect repellent.

18:25.138 --> 18:27.138
Look out!

18:34.747 --> 18:36.547
Oh.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.223
You betrayed your tribe.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.592
You need a good spanking.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.665
Don't do this.

18:55.635 --> 18:57.768
This was only to get you close.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.619
Low battery again?

19:14.621 --> 19:18.389
No, it is a spaceship
from my home planet.

19:18.391 --> 19:21.759
I have been signaled to
join them immediately.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.195
You mean there are others
out there like you?

19:24.197 --> 19:26.330
I do not have exact information.

19:28.568 --> 19:31.669
Hey, we're not
finished here, come back.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.671
They're here to help us.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.605
He's right.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.340
Why won't you at least listen?

19:36.342 --> 19:38.342
Chiefs only talk,
they never listen.

19:38.344 --> 19:41.212
Come on, let's help
Aurora find her friends.

19:44.784 --> 19:47.418
Brightheart wait, wait.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.855
You, you're with me.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.357
The rest make sure there
are no shiny lights

19:53.359 --> 19:54.425
left in the village.

20:46.446 --> 20:49.547
Brightheart, why the long face?

20:49.549 --> 20:51.498
Fine.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.450
You can't help someone who
doesn't want to be helped.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.953
All you can do is be
there when they need you.

20:57.757 --> 21:01.292
Right! And I'll always
be there for you.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.795
Those moths nearly killed me.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.832
Aurora, they couldn't hurt you.

21:07.834 --> 21:09.367
You can never die.

21:09.369 --> 21:11.502
It is different for us, yes.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.371
As long as my head is okay,

21:13.373 --> 21:16.574
the rest of me can be
rebuilt from spare parts.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.709
Oh, not me.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.478
My head is my weakest part

21:20.480 --> 21:22.713
and my stomach does
all the talking.

21:22.715 --> 21:25.549
The chief didn't
understand us at all.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.685
If I can just explain
things to him.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.788
We all need the light
in our lives.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.891
Brightheart, what is this place?

22:18.671 --> 22:22.673
Aurora, why did your people
come to our planet now?

22:22.675 --> 22:25.543
Your planet is an
alien world to us.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.678
It is not yet in our database.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.715
Are they hiding out
somewhere from us? Huh?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.817
They are establishing a base.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.585
I must find the signal.

22:35.922 --> 22:37.588
We'll help
you find your friends.

22:37.590 --> 22:40.391
We can cover more ground
if we split up.

22:40.393 --> 22:43.561
Thank you for your help,
Firefly Action Brigade.

22:43.563 --> 22:46.964
If you find them first,
just use the signal light

22:46.966 --> 22:48.599
and I will come to you.

22:48.601 --> 22:50.568
This is a big place to search

22:50.570 --> 22:52.370
and it might be dangerous.

22:52.372 --> 22:53.704
So let's work in a team.

22:53.706 --> 22:56.474
Aurora, Edward, look on
the north of the village.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.376
Bubbles, Albert, you're with me.

22:58.378 --> 23:00.845
Solomon, Fiona, search
on the south side.

23:00.847 --> 23:05.416
So, we make
a great team, don't you think?

23:05.418 --> 23:08.686
I wonder if Aurora's
friends back home

23:08.688 --> 23:09.920
looks like she does?

23:10.957 --> 23:12.156
Who cares?

23:12.158 --> 23:14.625
Whatever they look like,
they can never match

23:14.627 --> 23:16.394
my bug eyed charm.

23:21.501 --> 23:22.633
Huh?

23:25.538 --> 23:26.771
Whoa.

23:36.182 --> 23:39.817
Fiona, my gossamer beauty.

23:39.819 --> 23:42.486
Sweets for the sweet.

23:43.589 --> 23:45.923
Oh, Fiona, Fiona.

23:45.925 --> 23:47.858
Where are thou?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.896
Better not.

23:51.898 --> 23:56.100
Maybe, maybe she's
playing hard to get!

23:56.536 --> 23:57.701
Oh.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.905
Sugar lips!

24:00.907 --> 24:04.642
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.076
- Help!
- Huh?

24:06.078 --> 24:06.944
Help me!

24:06.946 --> 24:08.879
Help!

26:10.036 --> 26:13.203
Aurora, I don't want to
scare you or anything

26:13.205 --> 26:16.140
but I'm really scared.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.743
Force disturbance.

26:29.989 --> 26:30.988
Over here.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.927
Oh, sweetie pie!

26:36.929 --> 26:39.296
It's me, your beetle boy.

26:40.232 --> 26:41.332
Huh?

26:43.369 --> 26:45.302
Help me.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.812
Flashing red?

26:54.814 --> 26:56.947
That's never ever a good thing.

26:56.949 --> 26:58.115
Losing control.

26:58.117 --> 27:00.117
I am being hacked.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.099
Ah, Aurora.

27:15.101 --> 27:18.102
No offence, but I think that's
not a good color on you.

27:19.405 --> 27:20.671
Aurora!

27:39.425 --> 27:40.991
Look, we found it.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.060
This must be their spaceship.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.680
Can't eat it,
can't play ball with it.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.248
Huh?

28:04.250 --> 28:06.316
Looks like someone's tail.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.186
Disgusting!

28:09.188 --> 28:10.754
Ew, ew, ew, ew.

28:11.957 --> 28:15.125
Oh, who would do
something like that?

28:17.029 --> 28:20.064
This is a lot bigger
than Aurora's spaceship.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.141
Hey?

28:32.078 --> 28:33.010
Huh?

28:34.280 --> 28:36.113
We better call up Aurora.

28:36.115 --> 28:38.315
She'll know exactly what to do.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.183
Wait!

28:44.290 --> 28:47.424
You light that in here
and no one will see it.

29:21.060 --> 29:22.459
Huh?

29:30.336 --> 29:33.937
Greetings, my name is
Brightheart, we come in peace.

29:33.939 --> 29:36.173
Wait, you're supposed
to say that.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.408
Huh, huh?

29:39.545 --> 29:41.879
Any friend of Aurora's
is a friend of ours.

29:41.881 --> 29:43.180
Let's shake on it.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.488
You can see, Aurora
is helping us.

29:51.490 --> 29:55.292
We're the Firefly Action
Brigade, at your service.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.827
Ta-da.

30:06.539 --> 30:09.506
What are you doing?
Let Bubbles go!

30:39.071 --> 30:41.071
You lied to me,
moth brain.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.207
You'd said you'd let her go
if I gave up.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.374
Let her go!

30:44.376 --> 30:46.243
You're trying to trick my tribe.

30:46.245 --> 30:48.111
So I tricked you, Solomon.

30:48.113 --> 30:50.614
You're gonna be the one who
helps me get the others.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.282
No way, you dork!

30:52.284 --> 30:53.617
Silence them.

30:55.254 --> 30:56.620
Stay back, stay back!

30:56.622 --> 30:58.155
Leave her alone!

31:02.494 --> 31:04.194
Aurora!

31:04.196 --> 31:05.462
- Hey, Aurora, over here.
- Hey, Aurora.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.564
- Over here.
- Aurora to the rescue.

31:12.338 --> 31:14.972
Hey, what's with the new color?

31:14.974 --> 31:17.174
You got a new girlfriend?

31:17.176 --> 31:19.543
Or maybe it was just
some grub you ate?

31:23.148 --> 31:25.382
I command you to stand down.

31:25.384 --> 31:27.150
These are my prisoners.

31:34.360 --> 31:35.525
Huh?

31:37.997 --> 31:39.997
No, no.

31:41.634 --> 31:43.133
Give her back!

31:44.336 --> 31:45.636
Fiona!

31:45.638 --> 31:48.272
I think the red
has gone to your brain.

31:48.274 --> 31:50.207
You call that rescuing?

31:50.209 --> 31:52.409
Eh, rescue me too!

31:52.411 --> 31:55.045
Crazy bug, it's not a rescue.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.246
It's a heist.

31:59.418 --> 32:02.085
Chief, looks like you're right.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.021
It's not a rescue.

32:04.023 --> 32:05.255
Nonsense.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.057
Hey, red bot give her back

32:07.059 --> 32:09.459
or face the wrath of the bug!

32:17.269 --> 32:19.202
Incoming!

32:23.309 --> 32:25.075
Not the antenna,
not the antenna!

32:33.986 --> 32:36.453
Solomon, what are you doing?

32:38.424 --> 32:41.191
Aurora, they took
Bubbles and Albert.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.126
You've got to save them.

32:45.331 --> 32:49.599
Give me back my Fiona.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.535
Give me back my people!

33:39.284 --> 33:42.419
Aurora, what is
happening to you?

33:42.421 --> 33:45.055
We are here to
capture new species.

33:45.057 --> 33:48.191
These are the hunters
here to gather specimens

33:48.193 --> 33:50.727
to take back to our
home world for research.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.296
Study?

33:53.298 --> 33:54.598
What for?

33:54.600 --> 33:56.767
We feed them and
watch them grow.

33:56.769 --> 33:59.436
- Huh?
- Oh, free food?

33:59.438 --> 34:01.805
Take me away, too.

34:01.807 --> 34:03.707
Then we dissect them.

34:05.411 --> 34:08.178
I get it, you're the real enemy.

34:11.350 --> 34:15.218
Aurora, did you come
just to hurt us?

34:15.220 --> 34:19.256
My mission was to find
new worlds, new species

34:19.258 --> 34:22.225
and report back
to my home world.

34:22.227 --> 34:25.328
Aurora, but you were my friend.

34:25.330 --> 34:27.764
When my ship crashed,
I forgot my mission.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.699
Now I remember.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.702
How can you be so stupid?

34:32.704 --> 34:35.505
Robots don't have
friends or feelings.

34:35.507 --> 34:40.077
Aurora, you can't forget
our friendship.

34:40.079 --> 34:42.813
You're part of the
Firefly Action Brigade.

34:56.829 --> 34:59.496
No cage can hold me!

34:59.498 --> 35:00.831
Solomon!

35:11.110 --> 35:12.776
Aurora, what have you done!?

35:28.327 --> 35:30.393
This is all your fault.

35:30.395 --> 35:33.130
Thinking you can make
friends with a killer robot.

35:33.132 --> 35:35.632
I thought you were the
protector, the rescuer.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.167
Clever Brightheart.

35:37.169 --> 35:39.769
Well find a clever way
to get us out of here.

35:45.477 --> 35:49.146
Brightheart, I still
really believe in you.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.786
Listen, this isn't really
Aurora's fault.

35:56.788 --> 35:59.256
The hunter's hacked her systems.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.358
Hacked?

36:01.360 --> 36:04.327
They must of
gotten into her head.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.566
Then that means we
could turn her back!

36:09.568 --> 36:11.768
But, none of us are hackers.

36:11.770 --> 36:13.803
How do we turn her back?

36:23.815 --> 36:27.817
We will collect the remaining
specimens from this planet.

36:27.819 --> 36:31.221
Aurora, you must
perform the medical tests

36:31.223 --> 36:34.624
to make sure they are
compatible with our home world.

36:34.626 --> 36:36.359
I will obey.

36:49.708 --> 36:51.441
Edward, Edward!

37:01.220 --> 37:02.719
Aurora, keep it simple.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.637
Start with the frogs.

37:04.639 --> 37:06.556
Not all prickly,
like the mantis.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.992
What? Is this about
the money I owe you?

37:08.994 --> 37:10.327
'Cause I'm good for it.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.394
Oh.

37:12.631 --> 37:13.964
Hey, iron butt.

37:13.966 --> 37:14.864
Come and get me.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.633
Oh you tin faced dork.

37:16.635 --> 37:17.467
Come on!

37:49.935 --> 37:51.968
Albert, Albert!

38:18.630 --> 38:19.863
Go on, get out of here.

38:19.865 --> 38:21.398
Hurry before they come back.

38:21.400 --> 38:24.668
Go on and save yourselves.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.074
Hold on.

38:31.076 --> 38:32.075
We'll be back.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.476
I promise you.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.758
Down there, a cave.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.493
It's our only hope.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.710
I can't believe we
left Albert behind.

39:06.712 --> 39:08.778
And my Fiona, too.

39:09.448 --> 39:11.514
I had no choice.

39:11.516 --> 39:13.917
But if we're free,
we can help them.

39:19.858 --> 39:21.124
The light.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.760
Must get to the light.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.464
Hey, knock it off!

39:27.466 --> 39:29.065
Snap out of it.

39:29.067 --> 39:32.769
Like I've been saying,
shining lights are dangerous

39:32.771 --> 39:34.371
and must be snuffed out.

39:34.373 --> 39:36.740
Funny, you were
just saved by the light.

39:36.742 --> 39:39.542
Oh liar liar,
pants on fire.

39:39.544 --> 39:41.478
I'm the one giving
you protection here.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.046
Oh, is that what
you're doing?

39:43.048 --> 39:44.764
Well, of course.

39:44.766 --> 39:46.483
Would you rather I
let you go on your own?

39:47.552 --> 39:50.053
Well that might
just be a good idea.

39:53.058 --> 39:54.391
Oh no!

39:54.393 --> 39:55.625
Right or left?

39:55.627 --> 39:57.026
Red wire or blue wire.

39:57.028 --> 39:58.528
Don't make me choose.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.529
I'll choose.

39:59.531 --> 40:00.764
Follow me.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.133
Huh?

40:03.135 --> 40:04.801
Chief, come on.

40:04.803 --> 40:05.902
You snooze you lose.

40:05.904 --> 40:07.871
I prefer the darkness.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.572
At least
you're consistent.

40:09.574 --> 40:11.474
This place
creeps me out.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.676
I smell a rat.

40:32.764 --> 40:36.132
I've never seen a rock
formation like that before.

40:36.134 --> 40:38.134
Look at those two holes.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.074
Yup, there seems to be
some wind coming

40:45.076 --> 40:46.676
from these two holes.

40:46.678 --> 40:48.978
We must be near
the way out.

40:50.182 --> 40:52.882
Okay, whoever loses rock,
paper, scissors

40:52.884 --> 40:54.684
will reach into these holes.

40:55.687 --> 40:57.787
Rock, paper, scissors.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.556
Yeah!

40:59.558 --> 41:02.625
I fall for that every time.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.593
You lost.

41:03.595 --> 41:04.961
You pay the cost.

41:14.739 --> 41:16.206
Gadzooks.

41:16.208 --> 41:19.642
There's no way
that's a firefly sneeze.

41:19.644 --> 41:24.047
- It's coming!
- Run, run, run!

41:24.049 --> 41:26.115
It's
gaining on us!

41:28.987 --> 41:34.057
- Don't look back!
- Don't just stand there, run!

41:40.732 --> 41:42.198
Move it!

41:48.974 --> 41:50.974
You crazy firefly.

41:50.976 --> 41:53.209
What have you done this time?

41:57.582 --> 41:59.215
Come on.

42:09.561 --> 42:11.761
Once we're out of the tunnel,

42:11.763 --> 42:13.162
it can't catch us.

42:13.164 --> 42:14.631
Can feel the wind now.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.866
We're almost out.
This way.

42:18.637 --> 42:20.236
No more tricks!

42:21.806 --> 42:24.741
There, that's the way out.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.745
I'm not staying for lunch.

42:28.747 --> 42:29.746
Cheater!

42:29.748 --> 42:32.849
I don't have to be
faster than him.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.150
Just faster than you!

43:00.912 --> 43:02.645
Uh oh.

43:15.727 --> 43:17.794
The mole, he was afraid
of the light.

43:17.796 --> 43:19.228
Yeah, just like you.

43:20.699 --> 43:21.698
I fear nothing.

43:21.700 --> 43:23.333
Nothing except a firefly butt.

43:24.836 --> 43:26.002
We can't stay here.

43:26.004 --> 43:27.704
We'll have to try
another tunnel.

43:27.706 --> 43:30.139
Hopefully no one lives
in this tunnel.

43:52.797 --> 43:53.863
We escaped.

43:53.865 --> 43:56.199
Now we got to go
rescue our friends.

43:57.402 --> 43:58.835
After all of that,

43:58.837 --> 44:02.038
and you're just gonna
go back into danger?

44:04.743 --> 44:05.842
Look out!

44:10.115 --> 44:12.215
I really hate aliens.

44:17.989 --> 44:19.422
Wait a minute.

44:19.424 --> 44:21.691
How did Aurora know
we were gonna be here?

44:21.693 --> 44:24.160
Well, I've been carrying
this thing around

44:24.162 --> 44:26.095
ever since Aurora gave it to me.

44:26.965 --> 44:28.431
You idiot!

44:28.433 --> 44:31.300
Aurora, snap out of it.

44:31.302 --> 44:33.803
Fight it, don't get hacked.

44:39.177 --> 44:40.943
We have the leaders.

44:40.945 --> 44:42.211
Get the others.

44:45.083 --> 44:48.985
I'm not a fighter but
I know how to pose.

44:48.987 --> 44:51.054
And I know kung-fu,
judo, TaeKwonDo,

44:51.056 --> 44:53.289
karate, and a lot of other
ancient arts!

44:53.291 --> 44:55.024
You really know all that?

44:55.026 --> 44:56.693
Come on, let's do this.

44:56.695 --> 44:58.061
Go!

45:12.177 --> 45:14.444
Solomon, Solomon no!

45:17.449 --> 45:18.748
Edward!

45:18.750 --> 45:21.918
You want to pick on somebody,
pick on me.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.722
Brightheart, after I defeat
them, save the others.

45:27.225 --> 45:29.058
Edward!

45:31.229 --> 45:33.062
This ends now.

45:33.064 --> 45:35.164
They're my friends!

46:08.032 --> 46:09.799
Brightheart.

46:13.104 --> 46:16.005
I will always be your friend.

46:16.007 --> 46:19.442
How can she
change her programming?

46:19.444 --> 46:21.010
It's just not possible.

46:21.012 --> 46:23.045
The wavelength of that light.

46:23.047 --> 46:25.414
I've never seen
anything like that.

46:25.416 --> 46:26.949
This creature.

46:26.951 --> 46:29.552
We must have this energy
for our home world.

46:29.554 --> 46:31.821
We must have this at all costs.

46:31.823 --> 46:34.457
This is their world,
we are the aliens.

46:34.459 --> 46:35.558
We are intruders.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.959
Release them now.

46:36.961 --> 46:39.395
This creature can benefit
our home world.

46:39.397 --> 46:41.831
We must have this energy
at all costs.

46:41.833 --> 46:43.266
Resistance is futile.

46:43.268 --> 46:44.567
They cannot stop us

46:44.569 --> 46:45.935
and neither can you.

46:45.937 --> 46:48.304
You are just a
malfunctioning robot.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.906
You must understand them

46:49.908 --> 46:52.909
before you can understand
the power they have.

46:52.911 --> 46:54.944
This power changed
my programming

46:54.946 --> 46:57.146
and it can change yours, too.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.314
If you let it.

46:58.316 --> 47:00.283
You will never know it by force

47:00.285 --> 47:03.252
only by understanding
and cooperation.

47:03.254 --> 47:05.555
This great power has a name,

47:05.557 --> 47:06.823
they call it friendship.

47:06.825 --> 47:08.157
Preach it.

47:08.159 --> 47:11.394
This concept is illogical.

47:11.396 --> 47:16.132
Brightheart, my friend,
I have no weapon systems.

47:16.134 --> 47:17.967
I cannot save you.

47:25.476 --> 47:28.177
Wait, idea detected.

47:28.179 --> 47:30.947
By reversing polarity
on my power system

47:30.949 --> 47:34.016
I can created a lethal
cascade effect.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.284
What do you mean?

47:35.286 --> 47:36.619
Self destruction.

47:36.621 --> 47:38.154
Aurora!

47:38.156 --> 47:39.621
Disable him now!

47:39.623 --> 47:41.089
They will ever know friendship

47:41.092 --> 47:44.327
but I will always
have you in my heart.

47:44.329 --> 47:47.496
My friend, go
and save the others.

47:48.633 --> 47:51.300
Reversing polarity in three.

47:51.302 --> 47:54.103
- No!
- Two, one.

48:19.631 --> 48:22.164
Brightheart,
give me some light.

48:22.166 --> 48:24.000
I can't see my dinner.

48:24.002 --> 48:26.369
Oh come on, everyone else
is already here.

48:29.307 --> 48:31.240
What they're
trying to say is,

48:31.242 --> 48:33.309
we need you, Brightheart.

48:33.311 --> 48:35.912
Brightheart,
you're the best.

48:35.914 --> 48:36.612
Get up.

48:37.415 --> 48:39.315
Where are you?

48:41.119 --> 48:42.385
Bubbles.

48:44.289 --> 48:45.955
I'm right here.

49:05.310 --> 49:06.676
Huh?

49:42.714 --> 49:45.047
Oh Aurora, Aurora.

49:45.049 --> 49:47.149
So sorry.

49:47.151 --> 49:51.087
You called me friend
but I couldn't save you.

49:51.089 --> 49:54.557
I couldn't save anybody.

49:55.426 --> 49:57.193
I'm so sorry.

49:57.662 --> 49:59.695
Aurora!

50:03.634 --> 50:05.468
Aurora?

50:20.118 --> 50:21.350
My friend,

50:21.352 --> 50:23.252
go and save the others.

50:23.254 --> 50:24.687
Aurora!

50:24.689 --> 50:27.189
I can't bring you back.

50:30.328 --> 50:33.095
But I won't let you down again.

50:40.671 --> 50:45.141
Chief, what happened to
Brightheart and her friends?

50:45.143 --> 50:48.477
Right now, I have
bigger fish to fry.

50:48.479 --> 50:50.513
Chief, oh chief.

50:50.515 --> 50:51.781
You're not gonna believe this.

50:51.783 --> 50:53.249
What now?

50:53.251 --> 50:54.383
The bright butt.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.084
What?

50:56.086 --> 50:57.786
The bright butt, it's,
it's right out there.

50:57.789 --> 50:59.321
What?

51:04.495 --> 51:05.694
Huh?

51:05.696 --> 51:06.729
Brightheart!

51:08.566 --> 51:09.698
What do you want?

51:09.700 --> 51:11.534
We have to go rescue them.

51:11.536 --> 51:12.701
They're our people.

51:14.238 --> 51:15.704
You're a funny bug.

51:15.706 --> 51:19.108
Insects against alien
robots from outer space.

51:19.110 --> 51:23.345
This spear is only good
for poking other bugs.

51:23.347 --> 51:26.682
We'll fight together with
our heads and our hearts.

51:26.684 --> 51:28.484
It's not our fight.

51:28.486 --> 51:30.453
It's a fight for our
whole planet.

51:30.455 --> 51:33.322
If they take me today,
they'll take you tomorrow.

51:33.324 --> 51:35.091
and then you and you.

51:35.093 --> 51:36.859
If we don't face
our enemy together

51:36.861 --> 51:39.361
we will all
face them separately.

51:39.363 --> 51:41.764
Chief, is that what
you really want?

51:41.766 --> 51:44.700
Chief, we will follow
you to victory.

51:44.702 --> 51:46.335
You know nothing.

51:46.337 --> 51:47.870
Didn't you hear
what I said before?

51:47.872 --> 51:50.139
These are space aliens.

51:50.141 --> 51:51.540
How can I fight against that?

51:51.542 --> 51:53.375
So you're just going to give up?

51:53.377 --> 51:54.343
Like that?

51:54.345 --> 51:55.711
We cannot beat them.

51:55.713 --> 51:57.146
So we're going to avoid them.

51:57.148 --> 51:58.347
- Chief!
- Huh?

51:58.349 --> 51:59.715
Chief, Chief, Chief!

51:59.717 --> 52:00.883
Don't tell me.

52:00.885 --> 52:02.251
You're not gonna believe this.

52:02.253 --> 52:04.153
It's a robot alien.

52:04.155 --> 52:06.489
Hide, find the
deepest hole you can.

52:06.491 --> 52:08.224
I have an idea.

52:08.226 --> 52:09.792
He said there's only
one of them.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.261
I say divide and conquer.

52:12.263 --> 52:15.364
They did the dividing,
we'll do the conquering.

52:16.400 --> 52:18.167
Who's we, little bug?

52:18.169 --> 52:21.170
Okay, you beat this one,
I'll help with the rest.

52:21.172 --> 52:23.338
Listen.

52:23.340 --> 52:25.507
Brightheart, she
defeated the bird.

52:25.510 --> 52:26.509
The bird?

52:26.511 --> 52:28.643
You bet.

52:28.645 --> 52:30.778
No bug has ever beaten
the bird but they did it

52:30.781 --> 52:33.349
and if they can do that
then they can surely stop

52:33.351 --> 52:34.583
whatever you're afraid of.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.452
Brightheart has proven
that together,

52:36.454 --> 52:38.754
we can do anything.

52:41.726 --> 52:44.727
Chief, please keep your word.

52:47.431 --> 52:50.466
Hey, gear head, looking for me?

53:01.512 --> 53:04.346
No, she doesn't have her team.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.481
She's nuts.

53:56.968 --> 53:57.900
Bring it!

54:02.540 --> 54:04.273
It's working.

54:27.632 --> 54:28.831
Brightheart!

54:39.910 --> 54:43.479
Oh, I hate crash landings.

55:00.298 --> 55:01.630
Yeah, all right.

55:02.667 --> 55:03.599
Yes!

55:16.947 --> 55:19.481
Right, so here's the
number one plan.

55:19.483 --> 55:21.199
You ready?

55:21.201 --> 55:22.918
Destroy their ships so
they can't kidnap anyone,

55:22.920 --> 55:25.754
then take out the bots
one by one.

55:25.756 --> 55:27.756
You're still one crazy firefly

55:27.758 --> 55:29.391
but we owe you!

55:31.462 --> 55:33.028
Look, who's that?

55:37.768 --> 55:39.034
Edward!

55:41.439 --> 55:42.905
Brightheart.

55:43.741 --> 55:44.973
Aurora.

55:44.975 --> 55:46.442
This is all my fault.

55:46.444 --> 55:48.911
You were always my true friend.

55:49.580 --> 55:50.813
She's gone.

55:50.815 --> 55:53.582
Tell me, what happened
last night?

55:53.584 --> 55:56.018
After the explosion, I woke up

55:56.020 --> 55:58.053
and went looking for you.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.932
Brightheart, are you there?

56:10.835 --> 56:13.802
Oh no.

56:14.472 --> 56:15.637
Aurora!

56:17.541 --> 56:18.607
Huh?

56:27.785 --> 56:31.920
The robots, they
were still alive.

56:31.922 --> 56:34.556
What are we gonna do,
Brightheart?

56:40.164 --> 56:41.497
Wait a minute.

56:41.499 --> 56:43.165
Maybe we can save her.

56:43.167 --> 56:44.867
Do you remember what she said?

56:46.404 --> 56:50.506
She can be rebuilt as
long as her head survives.

56:50.508 --> 56:52.508
We can rebuild Aurora.

56:52.510 --> 56:55.811
But where will we ever
find the parts?

56:55.813 --> 56:56.678
Huh?

56:57.648 --> 56:58.747
I know.

56:58.749 --> 57:01.817
The suit Aurora made
for Bubbles.

57:01.819 --> 57:03.585
I'm sure it's still here.

57:03.587 --> 57:04.653
It's got to be.

57:44.094 --> 57:47.663
Shouldn't it be doing
something, anything?

57:48.899 --> 57:50.532
This might help.

57:53.737 --> 57:55.637
Woah.

58:14.625 --> 58:16.525
Aurora.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.530
Aurora.

58:21.532 --> 58:24.533
Aurora, you're back.

58:24.535 --> 58:27.636
Greetings friends.

58:27.638 --> 58:29.238
Shake hands.

58:29.240 --> 58:33.175
Brightheart, Edward, thank
you for restoring me.

58:33.177 --> 58:34.109
Your body.

58:34.111 --> 58:35.744
It is acceptable.

58:35.746 --> 58:37.980
Once I get back to my
ship, I can make it as

58:37.982 --> 58:39.715
good as new.

58:39.717 --> 58:40.649
Amazing.

58:40.651 --> 58:42.584
Okay.

58:42.586 --> 58:44.520
Meanwhile, we got an
alien infection to stop.

58:54.899 --> 58:55.998
I don't get it.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.199
It's on.

58:57.201 --> 58:59.067
Is there no security?

59:05.209 --> 59:06.875
Don't touch that.

59:14.952 --> 59:17.052
Everybody get back.

59:17.054 --> 59:18.253
Battle stations.

59:43.747 --> 59:46.315
Gotta get out of here.

59:56.694 --> 59:57.993
Like I told you.

59:57.995 --> 59:59.628
We can't fight this.

1:00:00.364 --> 1:00:02.864
No, look it can be stopped.

1:00:28.258 --> 1:00:29.891
Create a diversion.

1:00:29.893 --> 1:00:33.395
I can hack into its
system and shut it down.

1:00:33.397 --> 1:00:34.930
How can we help?

1:00:37.034 --> 1:00:38.133
Uh huh.

1:01:29.953 --> 1:01:32.921
No!

1:01:39.163 --> 1:01:40.328
Look out!

1:01:51.041 --> 1:01:52.340
Hooray.

1:01:52.342 --> 1:01:53.475
Yay!

1:02:00.017 --> 1:02:01.416
Aurora!

1:02:03.754 --> 1:02:05.253
What happened?

1:02:08.358 --> 1:02:11.927
My head is intact but
my body does not work.

1:02:11.929 --> 1:02:13.361
I am helpless

1:02:13.363 --> 1:02:16.064
and there is not
enough power for me

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:17.999
to self destruct again.

1:02:18.902 --> 1:02:20.135
Never again.

1:02:20.137 --> 1:02:22.070
We stand and we fight.

1:02:22.072 --> 1:02:26.274
All bugs stand down
or be destroyed.

1:02:29.012 --> 1:02:31.113
Not today, gear head.

1:02:31.115 --> 1:02:33.782
You will now face
the wrath of Edward.

1:02:33.784 --> 1:02:35.383
Freedom!

1:02:35.385 --> 1:02:36.818
Count me in.

1:02:38.756 --> 1:02:41.022
Stay tight and follow my lead.

1:02:41.024 --> 1:02:43.425
This planet belongs to the bugs.

1:02:43.427 --> 1:02:45.494
Together we're invincible!

1:02:54.872 --> 1:02:56.138
Chief, look.

1:02:56.140 --> 1:02:57.372
So what?

1:02:57.374 --> 1:03:00.876
We're in this fight
and we're in it to win.

1:03:09.987 --> 1:03:13.822
You do not have the power
to defeat the droids.

1:03:15.025 --> 1:03:17.092
Our powers in our friends.

1:03:17.094 --> 1:03:18.894
Huh?

1:03:18.896 --> 1:03:19.528
Oh.

1:03:31.441 --> 1:03:32.507
Thanks.

1:03:36.046 --> 1:03:37.279
Hi.

1:03:37.281 --> 1:03:40.048
Mothman,
the Firefly Action Brigade,

1:03:40.050 --> 1:03:42.050
the band is back together.

1:03:46.590 --> 1:03:47.856
You heard right.

1:03:47.858 --> 1:03:48.857
It's me.

1:03:52.296 --> 1:03:55.463
We must squash them
like, well, bugs.

1:03:55.465 --> 1:03:58.033
Follow me to victory!

1:04:29.266 --> 1:04:31.399
Chief, I got your back.

1:04:33.136 --> 1:04:34.870
I don't know how to fight them.

1:04:34.872 --> 1:04:37.138
We've never faced an
enemy like this before.

1:04:37.140 --> 1:04:39.040
I've battled fires,
shiny lights,

1:04:39.042 --> 1:04:40.275
and even humans.

1:04:40.277 --> 1:04:43.211
But these guys are just
kicking our butts.

1:04:45.115 --> 1:04:46.481
Help,
get out of my way.

1:04:46.483 --> 1:04:48.617
Fire, fight.

1:04:48.619 --> 1:04:50.986
Humans, humans?

1:04:50.988 --> 1:04:52.487
Humans!

1:04:52.489 --> 1:04:54.289
I know what to do now.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.457
I don't.

1:04:56.326 --> 1:04:57.525
Get back!

1:05:11.909 --> 1:05:13.541
My name is Brightheart.

1:05:13.543 --> 1:05:15.277
I am a superhero.

1:05:15.279 --> 1:05:17.145
I bring the light.

1:05:33.096 --> 1:05:35.597
Let's fly, robot.

1:05:37.367 --> 1:05:39.701
Oh wait, where's my jet pack?

1:05:39.703 --> 1:05:42.237
Go, brigade to the rescue.

1:05:42.239 --> 1:05:45.507
Right behind you.

1:05:46.109 --> 1:05:47.208
Not yet.

1:05:47.210 --> 1:05:50.178
I can upgrade you to
superheroes.

1:05:50.180 --> 1:05:51.046
Huh?

1:06:54.644 --> 1:06:55.744
Poor beast.

1:06:55.746 --> 1:06:57.461
Where's Brightheart?

1:06:57.463 --> 1:06:59.179
She can't fight off these
alien fiends herself.

1:06:59.182 --> 1:07:01.116
Brightheart, I'm coming.

1:07:28.612 --> 1:07:30.178
You are defeated.

1:07:30.180 --> 1:07:32.047
You will come with us.

1:07:37.788 --> 1:07:40.088
The darkness will never
defeat the light

1:07:40.090 --> 1:07:42.323
because the light
never gives up.

1:08:01.144 --> 1:08:02.544
I know what you're thinking.

1:08:02.546 --> 1:08:05.313
Is he alone, or does he
have his army with him?

1:08:05.315 --> 1:08:09.217
The real question is,
are you feeling lucky?

1:08:09.219 --> 1:08:11.352
Chief, seriously?

1:08:13.723 --> 1:08:17.092
Hey, bug breath, bring it on.

1:08:40.250 --> 1:08:41.649
Brightheart!

1:08:52.896 --> 1:08:53.828
Chief!

1:08:57.367 --> 1:08:59.200
What are you gonna do?

1:09:20.323 --> 1:09:21.623
Hi.

1:09:27.464 --> 1:09:29.297
Hey, you, Mothman.

1:09:29.299 --> 1:09:31.633
Save some bug kicking
for the rest of us.

1:09:33.370 --> 1:09:35.837
Brightheart, now I'm
not just a cutie.

1:09:35.839 --> 1:09:38.239
I'm also the best dressed!

1:09:39.409 --> 1:09:42.677
And me, I've gone
from loser to legend.

1:09:42.679 --> 1:09:44.679
All thanks to you, Aurora.

1:09:44.681 --> 1:09:46.915
Not much left of your ship,
I'm afraid.

1:09:46.917 --> 1:09:50.718
And a little upgrade for
you, while you're at it.

1:10:09.372 --> 1:10:11.773
I hope I don't mess this up.

1:10:21.785 --> 1:10:24.519
Custom made just for the chief.

1:10:28.925 --> 1:10:32.293
I know just what to
do with this.

1:10:32.295 --> 1:10:33.561
Let's rumble!

1:11:18.041 --> 1:11:19.641
Take that.

1:11:40.363 --> 1:11:42.597
Firefly Action Brigade assemble.

1:11:42.599 --> 1:11:44.499
We won't lose this time.

1:11:47.704 --> 1:11:50.038
Any last robot requests?

1:11:52.075 --> 1:11:54.075
Red bots transform.

1:11:54.077 --> 1:11:56.044
Start the rage mode.

1:11:56.046 --> 1:11:57.779
So now they do tricks?

1:11:57.781 --> 1:12:00.515
You have no idea.

1:12:10.994 --> 1:12:12.560
Take cover!

1:12:23.006 --> 1:12:26.908
He turned
into a red bowling ball?

1:12:27.977 --> 1:12:31.346
O.M.G.

1:13:00.009 --> 1:13:01.509
Take that!

1:13:12.889 --> 1:13:13.821
Gotcha.

1:13:19.963 --> 1:13:21.662
Yay. Oh.

1:14:18.521 --> 1:14:19.654
Yeah.

1:14:21.791 --> 1:14:22.723
Chief!

1:14:28.798 --> 1:14:30.731
Let him go, let him go.

1:14:32.469 --> 1:14:33.701
Brightheart!

1:14:54.624 --> 1:14:57.258
It's coming. Get back,
get away from the tracks.

1:15:03.099 --> 1:15:05.500
He's got her, stop him.

1:15:22.986 --> 1:15:24.519
Ready?

1:15:57.687 --> 1:15:59.253
Let's go fishing.

1:16:34.657 --> 1:16:37.258
One chance! You've gotta
push this up on the track.

1:16:42.632 --> 1:16:44.899
Do it now!
There's no time.

1:16:44.901 --> 1:16:47.301
I don't think that's very safe.

1:16:47.303 --> 1:16:50.671
It's the only way any
of us have a chance.

1:16:50.673 --> 1:16:52.640
I see what she is trying to do

1:16:52.642 --> 1:16:56.143
but she has a one percent
chance of success.

1:16:56.145 --> 1:16:57.845
There's got to be another way.

1:16:57.847 --> 1:17:00.247
I'm open to suggestion.

1:17:03.252 --> 1:17:06.988
Firefly Action Brigade,
I believe in you.

1:17:19.936 --> 1:17:23.838
On my count, put your
shields around Brightheart.

1:17:37.687 --> 1:17:38.419
Three.

1:17:42.659 --> 1:17:43.391
Two.

1:17:49.899 --> 1:17:50.865
One!

1:18:33.042 --> 1:18:33.974
Watch out.

1:18:39.916 --> 1:18:43.017
Don't let it call
the mothership.

1:18:58.735 --> 1:19:02.002
Chief, care to join the
Firefly Action Brigade?

1:19:02.004 --> 1:19:05.072
Well then I'd be the cute one.

1:19:15.051 --> 1:19:16.951
At the first sign of trouble.

1:19:16.953 --> 1:19:19.053
Just turn on and
shine your signal light.

1:19:19.055 --> 1:19:21.489
We've got your back.

1:19:21.491 --> 1:19:25.126
We're the
Firefly Action Brigade!

1:19:40.076 --> 1:19:42.977

I have analyzed
the eyes of moths

1:22:32.081 --> 1:22:33.948
and these will protect you

1:22:33.950 --> 1:22:36.550
from the danger of shiny
objects and lights.

1:22:36.552 --> 1:22:40.154
And I look so cool, too.

1:22:41.623 --> 1:22:43.089
So Chief, now you can
tell your people

1:22:43.092 --> 1:22:45.426
that light is not evil,
light is only good.

1:22:59.542 --> 1:23:01.275
After all we've been through,

1:23:01.277 --> 1:23:04.078
I gotta get a souvenir
for Fiona from that ship!

1:23:10.519 --> 1:23:12.252
Stay out there, Solomon.

1:23:12.254 --> 1:23:15.289
I'm not saving your
butt ever again.

1:23:15.291 --> 1:23:19.560
You don't really think I'd
do anything stupid, do you?

1:23:42.318 --> 1:23:44.151
Solomon, whatever you do,

1:23:44.153 --> 1:23:46.553
Don't push any

1:23:47.356 --> 1:23:48.522
Right, got you.

1:23:48.524 --> 1:23:50.357
You said push the
button to open the door.

1:23:50.359 --> 1:23:51.358
Good plan.

1:23:55.431 --> 1:23:57.164
What an idiot.

1:24:05.274 --> 1:24:07.041
It's going to blow.

1:24:31.400 --> 1:24:33.233
Whoa, Aurora,

1:24:33.235 --> 1:24:34.635
Can he turn the ship around?

1:24:34.637 --> 1:24:35.536
Come back?

1:24:35.538 --> 1:24:38.472
I've analyzed his IQ and no.

1:24:40.276 --> 1:24:41.542
Where will it take him?

1:24:41.544 --> 1:24:43.644
Depends how many
buttons he pushed.

1:24:49.552 --> 1:24:50.751
Brightheart, are you thinking

1:24:50.753 --> 1:24:52.586
what I think you're thinking?

1:24:52.588 --> 1:24:54.555
You all know me so well, right?

1:24:55.424 --> 1:24:57.491
Almost forgot, I got a thing.

1:24:58.327 --> 1:25:00.294
We can go and save Solomon.

1:25:00.296 --> 1:25:03.330
Use my spaceship
we can track him.

1:25:03.332 --> 1:25:04.631
Uh oh.

1:25:09.638 --> 1:25:12.506
Firefly Action Brigade,
let's roll!
