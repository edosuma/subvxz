23:27.083 --> 23:28.875
Does he go to the high school?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.000
Yeah.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.625
You look about the same age.

23:31.625 --> 23:32.458
Do you know him?

23:32.458 --> 23:34.666
No, I'm home schooled.

23:34.666 --> 23:36.125
Is that that a no?

homeschoolers are?

figure that a guy like

24:12.958 --> 24:15.208
me wouldn't be
sitting out in dust

24:15.208 --> 24:20.458
and, not hunting, well,
what else would I be doing?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.708
No, no, it's not.

24:21.708 --> 24:22.208
It's not.

see is struggling.

24:37.208 --> 24:41.250
People struggling.

24:41.250 --> 24:43.625
Working hard every day and
then the downside of life

24:43.625 --> 24:46.375
drags them down.

24:46.375 --> 24:49.708
Then they die.

24:49.708 --> 24:51.000
It's unavoidable.

cut off the middleman?

25:11.000 --> 25:11.500
Yeah.

25:14.833 --> 25:17.958
Maybe there's no light at all.

25:17.958 --> 25:20.000
Maybe it's just some
big lie, a sham.

25:22.666 --> 25:26.208
You mean the light is the lie?

25:26.208 --> 25:27.083
Something like that.

Hey, you know what?

25:34.791 --> 25:38.625
Even if it's dark,
there's still light.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.875
Even if there's a shadow,
there's a light out there

25:44.875 --> 25:45.875
to cast that shadow.

25:53.666 --> 25:55.291
Cool camera.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.166

25:58.708 --> 26:00.291

Saturday, if you want to come

26:18.541 --> 26:20.541

music do they play?

What kind of music do you like?

26:30.083 --> 26:31.291
The good stuff.

26:31.291 --> 26:34.375
You know, Elvis
Presley, Buddy Holly.

26:34.375 --> 26:37.333
It's really sad what
happened to them.

26:37.333 --> 26:39.208
Yeah.

It's really sad.

into that classic rock stuff.

Thanks, Suzie.

to meet you, Bob.

My head.

Robert?

49:42.791 --> 49:46.291
This was my parents' house.

49:46.291 --> 49:48.333
I remember all the meals
we used to eat together.

49:50.458 --> 49:52.791
Mother was always worrying
about whatever she was trying

49:52.791 --> 49:53.958
to prep for Sunday dinner.

49:56.583 --> 49:59.125
Father was always complaining
about whatever was on the news.

50:02.000 --> 50:04.958
My little sister.

She was always talking about
whatever her friends got

50:07.458 --> 50:08.875
that she wanted for Christmas.

50:18.250 --> 50:18.875
They left me.

50:34.208 --> 50:35.708
I was once Robert Grayson.

50:39.416 --> 50:40.916
And then I saw the
void in my heart.

50:43.583 --> 50:46.500
I served it.

50:46.500 --> 50:49.541
Not for much longer.

I may not look it, so
old, so cold, so tired.

There will soon be another,
another host for the void.

51:14.833 --> 51:20.416
This thing can't be you, Robert.

He isn't is Robert
Grayson anymore.

51:22.958 --> 51:24.875

He found this darkness, the same
thing that took the bullies,

51:28.750 --> 51:30.250
it turned him some
kind of puppet.

too and remembered,

51:31.916 --> 51:33.833
did you, power stealer?
