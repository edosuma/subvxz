WEBVTT

00:11.080 --> 00:14.480
Today is our fourth session.
Actually, in the previous three,

00:14.560 --> 00:18.000
even when, as they say,
the shit hit the fan,

00:18.280 --> 00:20.559
you managed to hold it together.

00:20.679 --> 00:23.879
-I didn't have to talk about my own shit.
-Today it's your turn.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.160
So I'd like to know, Federico,

00:28.239 --> 00:32.479
what are those parts of your path
you've been working on

00:32.560 --> 00:35.799
that you think have an impact
on your relationship with Chiara

00:35.880 --> 00:38.200
and that are part of your story.

00:39.119 --> 00:42.039
I don't relate to others
the way I relate to her.

00:42.320 --> 00:46.280
With others, I don't even
give them a chance.

00:46.359 --> 00:49.640
-To hurt you, you mean?
-To... I mean to...

00:49.719 --> 00:52.960
I don't give them a chance
to fuck me over, I'd say.

00:53.039 --> 00:55.479
I'm not even gonna give you that chance.

01:02.359 --> 01:04.000
MILAN
34TH WEEK - GYNECOLOGICAL EXAMINATION

01:04.079 --> 01:05.680
Let me go first.

01:05.760 --> 01:08.120
-Good morning, Doctor!
-Hello.

01:08.640 --> 01:10.280
-How are you?
-Good.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.439
Well, then...

01:14.519 --> 01:17.079
-Where's her little head?
-Where I have the probe.

01:17.159 --> 01:19.000
It looks like she has huge lips!

01:20.280 --> 01:22.920
-I can't see anything.
-The little nose and the lips.

01:23.039 --> 01:25.680
-I can see it.
-All smushed, all...

01:25.760 --> 01:27.879
Look at those chubby little hands!

01:27.960 --> 01:30.920
-Where do you see all these things?
-Look at the fingers!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.479
-Like this?
-Yes!

01:32.560 --> 01:33.879
-Like this?
-Like this.

01:35.759 --> 01:37.120
What's her weight now?

01:37.200 --> 01:40.319
-I'm gonna tell you now.
-I can tell you, 1.7 kg.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.879
-Or 1.4 kg.
-Let's see. Yes, 1.7 kg.

01:43.960 --> 01:46.719
-1.7 kg?
-You said 1.4, like last time.

01:46.799 --> 01:49.640
-The first thing I said was 1.7 kg.
-Well, but...

01:49.719 --> 01:51.000
That's what counts.

01:51.079 --> 01:52.280
He was right.

01:52.359 --> 01:55.039
-Can I ask a stupid question?
-By all means.

01:55.879 --> 01:59.840
-If she kicks really hard, can it do harm?
-No.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.200
-Was it a stupid question?
-No.

02:03.280 --> 02:06.280
-No question is stupid.
-"I know that I know nothing,"

02:06.359 --> 02:08.400
-once said...
-Someone important.

02:08.479 --> 02:09.960
-Who?
-Plato.

02:10.520 --> 02:12.439
-I think it was Aristotle.
-Aristotle?

02:12.520 --> 02:15.439
-I would have said Socrates.
-Maybe it was Socrates.

02:15.560 --> 02:16.879
One of the three.

02:19.120 --> 02:21.439
-Do you know what we'll try on Monday?
-No.

02:21.560 --> 02:25.879
We'll go with my friend, who's pregnant
with twins, and her boyfriend,

02:26.039 --> 02:28.879
and the two of them will try
these kind of electrodes

02:29.039 --> 02:31.599
that should simulate the pain
of childbirth.

02:32.039 --> 02:34.079
The pain of childbirth is intense.

02:34.159 --> 02:35.840
-It's crazy.
-It is.

02:35.879 --> 02:37.400
No, I know.

02:37.439 --> 02:39.879
-Shall we bet you're gonna scream?
-No way.

02:41.159 --> 02:42.360
-Shall we bet?
-I won't.

02:42.439 --> 02:44.879
-Let's bet something.
-I'm all tattooed up.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.360
-Yes, right.
-Tattoos hurt.

02:46.439 --> 02:49.840
-You cry when you get tattoos.
-I wanna know how it goes.

02:50.439 --> 02:54.840
Easy. I'll be like this.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.039
-I can imagine.
-Super easy. You'll see.

02:57.120 --> 03:00.719
No, no, no!

03:01.719 --> 03:03.879
No! Stop!

03:03.960 --> 03:05.520
-Stop!
-Come on, love!

03:05.599 --> 03:09.520
No, enough for me. I give up, no!

03:09.599 --> 03:12.240
-Come on!
-No, it hurts like crazy!

03:17.439 --> 03:20.719
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

03:20.800 --> 03:22.000
How about that

03:22.079 --> 03:25.240
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

03:25.319 --> 03:26.319
Like a yo-yo

03:26.400 --> 03:30.120
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

03:30.240 --> 03:34.439
So kiss me, silly,
And the show begins

03:34.520 --> 03:37.680
The Ferragnez

03:43.240 --> 03:45.319
GRANDMA CIANA'S HOUSE

03:46.479 --> 03:48.800
This is me going to Grandma Ciana,

03:49.159 --> 03:51.599
who lives in a council flat
in Giambellino.

03:52.159 --> 03:54.280
She's not very trustworthy.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.280
She says she was a skating champion,
but nobody in our family believes it.

03:58.840 --> 03:59.960
Hello, Grandma.

04:00.759 --> 04:04.000
Is it me getting smaller
or is it you growing up?

04:04.080 --> 04:05.919
She already did my cards.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.840
Leone, according to her reading,
was supposed to be a lioness.

04:09.919 --> 04:12.759
So, she didn't get it right.

04:15.759 --> 04:18.160
You're very busy, aren't you? So...

04:19.759 --> 04:23.079
-Can't you mute the keyboard?
-I can't even do it.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.879
Yes, you can put your phone
in silent mode.

04:26.000 --> 04:29.319
-You scared me!
-And you can't cross your legs!

04:30.800 --> 04:35.240
I wanna make something clear.
All these mystical characters

04:35.360 --> 04:38.560
are not usually together.
One substitutes the other.

04:38.639 --> 04:41.040
-One, two, or three?
-Three.

04:41.120 --> 04:45.639
In this series they put them all together,
I look like Wanna Marchi's lovechild.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.480
Okay, but read them right, Grandma.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.159
-Tell me what's going on.
-I need to look at them.

04:51.240 --> 04:53.800
I need to pair them,
I don't have a machine.

04:53.920 --> 04:57.920
So, that's the hope.

04:58.800 --> 05:01.800
You have to be patient, but you're not.

05:02.800 --> 05:07.120
And here, you will argue with someone.
A young man.

05:08.720 --> 05:10.920
Can you see what's here?

05:11.040 --> 05:14.920
He will betray you in the name
of love, of friendship.

05:15.879 --> 05:18.759
-Not again!
-Be careful.

05:18.800 --> 05:23.519
-You can't have friends. Unfortunately.
-But I don't have any! Just one.

05:23.639 --> 05:28.000
-So, I already know who it is. Nice.
-Well, it's still one.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.639
-Well.
-Ask her the name.

05:30.240 --> 05:31.560
Do we know who it is?

05:31.879 --> 05:33.240
I can already see him.

05:33.720 --> 05:38.000
-When I saw him, I already thought this.
-I know who it is, then.

05:38.079 --> 05:39.759
-Who is it?
-Luis, she's saying.

05:41.480 --> 05:43.360
These are heavy charges.

05:43.439 --> 05:47.920
My grandma specifically referred
to a person she only saw once,

05:48.199 --> 05:49.840
and so now...

05:50.879 --> 05:51.879
Let's hope not.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.120
LUIS
FEDEZ'S FRIEND

05:54.199 --> 05:55.600
Show me the TikTok.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.120
It's this one.

05:57.240 --> 05:59.480
-Andrea Damante did it.
-It looks easy.

05:59.560 --> 06:02.360
Federico, big Italian star.

06:02.920 --> 06:03.920
Fuck!

06:05.319 --> 06:07.399
No, Luis, come on!

06:07.480 --> 06:12.199
I'm known as the friend of the husband
of the big star.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.040
I'll hold on to your legs, wait.

06:15.519 --> 06:17.319
Okay, now...

06:17.720 --> 06:19.600
I'll fall on my face.

06:19.680 --> 06:20.839
I've got you, I've--

06:21.319 --> 06:25.240
Luis is a friend of mine.
He's a person I hold in very high esteem,

06:25.360 --> 06:28.000
he has great creativity,
and is very genuine.

06:28.079 --> 06:30.240
-Hold on tighter.
-I have Sanremo...

06:30.319 --> 06:31.519
I can't. Fuck!

06:35.920 --> 06:38.279
He met me at a time of transition,

06:38.360 --> 06:41.600
when I changed friends,
social circle, and vision.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.560
Oh, God, that hurt.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.319
-A nice moment, huh?
-Back to work.

06:47.399 --> 06:51.519
And I think he's part of the reason
I, somehow, changed.

06:53.360 --> 06:55.959
Federico, today I want to provoke you.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.639
And I'll start by telling you
that what you should do

06:59.720 --> 07:03.759
is take off the armor
and rely on a network of relationships

07:03.839 --> 07:06.360
that will allow you to trust people.

07:06.439 --> 07:09.639
I mean, I really don't feel the need to...

07:10.759 --> 07:13.879
expand my network of relationships.
I know it sounds absurd.

07:14.079 --> 07:20.079
It seems like I have a long road ahead,
but I've already improved a lot,

07:20.800 --> 07:22.279
compared to before.

07:22.839 --> 07:26.759
Sometimes it happens I wanna play
Russian Roulette with someone.

07:26.839 --> 07:32.480
The problem is that some I've played with
handed me a gun full of bullets.

07:32.560 --> 07:35.720
So with the people I trusted, many times,

07:35.800 --> 07:38.680
it didn't end well,
so this has done nothing

07:38.920 --> 07:41.079
but create additional walls.

07:41.399 --> 07:44.480
With time... I mean, I'm willing to do it.

07:44.560 --> 07:48.079
I'm building things that would lead me

07:48.759 --> 07:52.399
to forcefully expand the network
of relationships.

07:52.480 --> 07:54.319
For example, I created a podcast.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.360
With us today at Muschio Selvaggio...

07:56.439 --> 07:59.240
The podcast is the projection

07:59.319 --> 08:03.079
of my change, as it forces me
to sit at a table with people

08:03.160 --> 08:04.959
and interact with them.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.519
And you, Chiara?

08:06.879 --> 08:10.920
Because of my job,
I have similar people around me,

08:11.000 --> 08:14.920
and they're people who share
similar tastes or interests with me.

08:15.000 --> 08:18.639
-They all magically share your interests.
-No, it's true.

08:18.720 --> 08:20.000
But it's true, yes.

08:20.240 --> 08:24.800
I have few real long term friends,
but I had them long before that...

08:25.519 --> 08:26.759
For twelve years.

08:27.519 --> 08:31.360
Federico, what I wish
you could recognize in her,

08:31.439 --> 08:34.240
is that she has the ability

08:34.320 --> 08:38.120
to surround herself with people
who love her and will not betray her.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.879
-But she struggles more to recognize them.
-What do you mean?

08:43.000 --> 08:46.759
-When they betray her?
-Or when there are weird people around.

08:47.519 --> 08:50.360
I recognize hers better.
And you, vice versa, mine.

08:50.440 --> 08:51.879
-Well, yes.
-It's easier.

08:52.200 --> 08:57.879
Always in that perspective of a couple
that maintains itself well

08:57.960 --> 09:02.480
and lasts a hundred years as a couple,
you always have to be a safe space

09:02.519 --> 09:05.159
-for each other.
-Of course.

09:09.120 --> 09:11.399
FEBRUARY 8, 2021

09:14.600 --> 09:16.960
Oh! I'm the bunny from Rome!

09:17.039 --> 09:22.200
-What did you bring me?
-I brought food.

09:22.279 --> 09:23.279
Thank you!

09:24.320 --> 09:27.159
Fede, good morning, it's Ricky.
Can you hear me?

09:27.240 --> 09:28.519
Are you talking to me?

09:28.639 --> 09:30.759
-Yes.
-Yes, I can hear you, hello.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.440
-How many kisses?
-Lots.

09:32.519 --> 09:33.519
Lots, okay, go.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.879
If you could get it a little closer...

09:36.000 --> 09:37.399
-Like this?
-Perfect.

09:37.480 --> 09:43.360
-That's it.
-Is that it? I want more! No!

09:44.159 --> 09:46.519
-We're going live in three minutes.
-Okay.

09:46.639 --> 09:48.120
Careful.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.399
Power hit!

09:51.480 --> 09:54.519
-We've done a wonderful--
-I have the interview on RTL.

09:54.639 --> 09:55.639
-Sorry.
-Oh, okay.

09:56.879 --> 10:00.639
-Come, Daddy.
-Honey, I have an interview.

10:01.639 --> 10:02.960
Careful!

10:03.039 --> 10:05.480
We have here Francesca and Federico.

10:05.519 --> 10:07.039
-Good morning!
-Hi!

10:07.120 --> 10:09.240
Michielin and Fedez!

10:09.320 --> 10:10.960
Good morning, guys.

10:11.039 --> 10:12.720
-Hi! Good morning.
-Hi!

10:13.080 --> 10:14.519
How are you?

10:14.600 --> 10:18.600
-Good, very good, thanks.
-We heard the voice of a child.

10:18.639 --> 10:21.519
It's Francesca hiding something, probably.

10:21.600 --> 10:26.440
-Speaking of hiding something...
-Well.

10:26.519 --> 10:29.840
-Okay, I made an assist.
-You dropped that into our lap.

10:30.080 --> 10:34.440
Let's face this monster right away,
shall we? So we can get rid of it.

10:36.639 --> 10:37.639
EIGHT DAYS BEFORE

10:37.759 --> 10:42.399
Misstep for Fedez, who reveals part
of the song he will take to Sanremo,

10:42.480 --> 10:45.519
going against the regulation
that requires unpublished pieces.

10:45.639 --> 10:48.440
...how much do you like
the new Sanremo song?

10:49.639 --> 10:51.519
-One.
-No!

10:51.600 --> 10:54.080
Call me by my name...

10:54.159 --> 10:56.519
He posted on Instagram

10:56.639 --> 11:00.399
the song that he planned to bring
with Michielin to Sanremo.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.360
-Not good.
-By regulation, you can't.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.200
They must be unpublished pieces.

11:06.960 --> 11:10.559
What happened?
Basically, I was editing the video.

11:10.639 --> 11:13.759
To edit videos, I use this.

11:14.360 --> 11:15.679
This software here.

11:16.360 --> 11:19.000
I edited the video
with Leo's thing, you see?

11:20.559 --> 11:21.799
Here it is.

11:22.159 --> 11:24.759
And then there's a tiny part
that you can't see.

11:25.120 --> 11:27.639
-That was left there.
-My wife

11:27.720 --> 11:32.519
was rushing me. I tell her, "Give me
a moment, I need to be careful."

11:33.200 --> 11:34.879
Give me some time to post it.

11:35.480 --> 11:36.840
But she rushed me.

11:37.360 --> 11:42.840
And I posted a piece of the song. It's not
your fault, honey. It's mine. I'm a jerk.

11:42.919 --> 11:47.519
-Well, I feel a little guilty.
-I stopped crying five seconds ago,

11:47.600 --> 11:49.960
I called Francesca crying like an idiot.

11:51.679 --> 11:53.080
It's a nightmare.

11:54.039 --> 11:58.080
-Baby!
-Shit, we've been working for months!

11:58.159 --> 11:59.399
I know, love.

12:01.440 --> 12:03.519
I always fuck up over some bullshit.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.960
I know, but you didn't do anything.
You had an oversight

12:07.039 --> 12:11.360
on a delicate matter, but hey,
it happens, you didn't do it on purpose.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.480
I can't believe it.

12:12.559 --> 12:15.360
I wanted to do have a calm Sanremo.

12:15.440 --> 12:18.399
I wanted to have a calm,
peaceful experience, but no.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.519
-Fuck me.
-You'll never have that.

12:21.919 --> 12:25.120
I was obviously distraught because...

12:25.960 --> 12:31.120
Not only was I risking my work,
but other people's too, so I felt guilty.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.679
I'm willing to take the wave of crap.

12:33.799 --> 12:37.360
But there's a person involved
who has nothing to do with it.

12:38.159 --> 12:39.159
Everyone!

12:39.240 --> 12:42.440
-He had three minutes of... anguish.
-Anguish.

12:42.519 --> 12:44.360
I was very anxious, too.

12:44.440 --> 12:46.720
Yes, but I didn't take it out on you.

12:46.799 --> 12:51.559
No. He took it out on himself, on the fact
that it was something so stupid which,

12:51.639 --> 12:57.039
objectively, is a mistake we all make.
I lost count of how many times I did it.

12:57.120 --> 13:02.039
But at a certain point I said,
"Let's keep calm," and I faced it.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.000
-Should I call him Ama?
-I can turn this off.

13:08.600 --> 13:11.200
-Yes, hello.
-Hello, how are you?

13:11.279 --> 13:13.799
I'm sorry to bother you. Sorry.

13:13.879 --> 13:17.799
No, don't worry. I realize that's
how it goes with Sanremo.

13:17.879 --> 13:19.559
I swear, I'm mortified.

13:19.639 --> 13:21.759
AMADEUS
ARTISTIC DIRECTOR OF SANREMO 2021

13:21.840 --> 13:22.799
I feel like an ass.

13:22.879 --> 13:27.840
I don't understand how that could happen.
I really feel like shit.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.960
I must say

13:30.600 --> 13:35.440
-I'm very proud of Fede's reaction.
-If it were just me, I'd say...

13:35.519 --> 13:40.399
He was discouraged at first, which
was normal, but then he reacted, so...

13:41.200 --> 13:43.519
it's a big change

13:44.320 --> 13:46.279
from past crises...

13:47.159 --> 13:49.159
or past mistakes, let's say.

13:49.240 --> 13:52.320
-They need to check the regulation, so...
-Thank you.

13:52.440 --> 13:58.440
If I have news tomorrow, I'll text you,
since you may be in the studio.

13:58.600 --> 14:02.440
Yes, well, we'll be in the studio
practicing the song...

14:03.080 --> 14:07.120
not knowing whether we're going to do it
or not, so it's gonna be

14:07.200 --> 14:09.039
tragicomic, tomorrow.

14:09.120 --> 14:11.679
-Okay then, bye.
-Oh, well.

14:11.759 --> 14:13.120
-Bye.
-Bye.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.600
-Have a nice evening.
-You too.

14:18.480 --> 14:21.399
Imagine if they don't disqualify you,

14:21.840 --> 14:24.360
but you drop out
because the baby girl is born.

14:26.360 --> 14:29.200
In that case, it's not meant to be.

14:29.279 --> 14:31.759
Shit, why did you say that, honey?

14:33.200 --> 14:35.200
It went well, especially

14:35.320 --> 14:39.879
how the two of you managed the situation,
because it could have caused a war.

14:39.960 --> 14:41.440
Yes. It's true.

14:41.519 --> 14:42.799
Yes, it went great.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.279
FEBRUARY 1, 2021

14:48.840 --> 14:52.679
And then he didn't do the things
he usually does, like...

14:52.759 --> 14:56.320
posting, giving his explanations,
et cetera, which,

14:56.399 --> 15:00.679
when he makes a mistake,
it's not so much the mistake itself,

15:00.759 --> 15:03.960
but it's how he justifies it,
amplifying the problem.

15:04.039 --> 15:06.679
But this time, he was very controlled,
very good.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.759
A terrible moment,

15:08.879 --> 15:12.039
I felt like shit, total shit.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.480
Michielin, Fedez. This.

15:14.559 --> 15:18.000
Months' worth of work, of preparation...
What a disaster.

15:19.120 --> 15:22.159
I honestly believe it was meant to happen.

15:22.240 --> 15:25.399
There's no way
that an alignment of misfortunes,

15:25.480 --> 15:28.320
one connected to the other,
could lead to this.

15:30.399 --> 15:35.639
Fedez and Michielin won't be disqualified
and will participate to Sanremo.

15:36.480 --> 15:37.480
FEBRUARY 2, 2021

15:37.559 --> 15:43.399
It's 8:30 p.m. and they just told us that
Fede won't be disqualified from Sanremo.

15:45.759 --> 15:46.960
Full steam ahead!

15:47.039 --> 15:49.720
-Honey, are you happy?
-Yes!

15:49.799 --> 15:51.480
Is Daddy going to Sanremo?

15:51.879 --> 15:54.759
He's going? They didn't disqualify him?

15:55.440 --> 15:56.519
Yes?

15:56.600 --> 16:01.679
There's a side of you that's hard, tough,
it doesn't let anybody in,

16:01.759 --> 16:04.519
and then there's
this super sensitive side,

16:04.879 --> 16:10.399
the one that's able to cry,
that's able to throw itself into battles.

16:10.519 --> 16:14.759
It's a shame that you don't find
the courage, the strength

16:14.840 --> 16:17.720
to expand it to the maximum, because

16:17.799 --> 16:21.440
it's as if you were wearing an armor
to protect yourself,

16:21.559 --> 16:23.759
-the heavy kind of armor.
-Yes.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.759
Do you want to explain it to me?

16:26.320 --> 16:28.679
Various times, when I was a child,

16:28.799 --> 16:32.440
some things happened
in which I was actually...

16:32.519 --> 16:35.840
I didn't have control of the situation.

16:35.919 --> 16:38.480
This leads my head,

16:39.039 --> 16:41.799
my mind towards the fear,

16:41.879 --> 16:45.559
the obsessive paranoia of losing it.

16:45.639 --> 16:50.039
Do you want to tell me,
so Chiara can hear it?

16:53.679 --> 16:58.200
My dentist was a pedophile.
I was at elementary school.

16:58.279 --> 17:00.639
The dentist needed to do the X-rays.

17:00.720 --> 17:04.200
They put a lead blanket on you,
something like that.

17:04.279 --> 17:09.799
Dentists usually put it on top of kids'
underpants. But he would put it under.

17:10.400 --> 17:14.519
He disappeared. My parents tried to book
an appointment, but he wasn't there.

17:14.559 --> 17:18.920
They watch this TV special
and find out he was a pedophile.

17:19.440 --> 17:21.920
Shortly after, this person killed himself.

17:23.079 --> 17:28.799
I'm aware that nothing else happened,
I didn't suffer a more serious violation.

17:29.039 --> 17:33.039
What is that, really? It's a child who

17:33.079 --> 17:37.960
doesn't have control over the situation
and another person who preys on him.

17:40.079 --> 17:42.759
What does that humiliation say about you?

17:43.200 --> 17:45.920
Not feeling good enough,
not feeling capable,

17:47.240 --> 17:49.920
not having a great self-esteem in general.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.559
-So, I, Federico, belittle myself.
-Totally.

17:54.000 --> 17:57.440
But it was also my fuel, that led me to

17:57.519 --> 18:01.079
San Siro, to my company,
listed in the stock market...

18:02.039 --> 18:03.680
It led me to a series of things.

18:03.759 --> 18:08.519
Here's the point: what else do you have
to do to acknowledge your worth?

18:09.000 --> 18:13.640
If you were stronger, more confident
than that Federico, you'd go to Sanremo

18:14.079 --> 18:17.880
understanding that Sanremo
is the prize for what you've already done.

18:17.960 --> 18:20.319
You're going to Sanremo
because you're good,

18:20.400 --> 18:24.319
that's the prize, and should be enjoyed
as the vacation, the award.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.440
Yes, I agree.

18:25.519 --> 18:27.799
But if you think you're not worth enough,

18:27.920 --> 18:33.920
you always must prove to yourself
and the world that you are worthy.

18:35.799 --> 18:39.319
I wish I could support Fede,
be a rock for him anyway.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.160
Because I think that,
if he could look at his whole life,

18:43.240 --> 18:48.759
he'd learn to find peace of mind
and to live as positively as possible.

18:49.319 --> 18:54.319
This would make us remember Sanremo
with an even bigger smile on our faces.

18:54.440 --> 18:58.640
We're trying to do
Fede's first Versace fitting for Sanremo.

18:58.720 --> 19:00.680
-But there's no--
-And Leo's.

19:00.759 --> 19:02.160
The clothes are...

19:02.240 --> 19:05.440
We had a cute idea, given that I and Leo

19:05.519 --> 19:08.079
won't be physically at Sanremo,

19:08.200 --> 19:11.799
the first night we'll dress Leo
with an identical look to Fede's.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.440
Leo is afraid it's a doctor
taking his temperature.

19:15.519 --> 19:17.559
They'll be sweet, with matching clothes.

19:17.799 --> 19:21.319
When we meet next time,
with Donatella, you'll try them all.

19:21.400 --> 19:25.440
On the back of Fede's shirt,
there are four initials,

19:25.519 --> 19:30.000
F for "Federico," C for "Chiara,"
L for "Leone," and V for "Vittoria."

19:30.319 --> 19:31.799
-Hello, baby.
-Hi.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.039
What's wrong?

19:33.079 --> 19:36.079
It'll be the baby's name.
You guys already know it,

19:36.200 --> 19:38.079
by the time you watch this.

19:38.160 --> 19:39.240
I'll have a look.

19:39.759 --> 19:42.440
-So beautiful!
-Beautiful!

19:43.400 --> 19:45.079
Really beautiful.

19:46.240 --> 19:47.880
I like the detail on the back.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.720
Leo was convinced
that the tailor was a doctor,

19:51.799 --> 19:54.519
so he just would not allow himself
to be measured.

19:54.559 --> 19:55.640
No, Mommy!

19:55.720 --> 19:58.039
It was super stressful.

19:58.079 --> 19:59.720
She's taking your...

20:02.319 --> 20:04.240
-Leo.
-Give me your hand, look.

20:04.559 --> 20:08.000
Come on,
I'll leave you under the table, look.

20:08.799 --> 20:12.559
-It's over, baby, it's over.
-It's over.

20:12.640 --> 20:14.640
Why don't you like it?

20:14.720 --> 20:17.440
I don't like it
when they take the measurements!

20:17.519 --> 20:20.279
But we're done!
You don't have to do it anymore!

20:20.880 --> 20:23.720
-Daddy is doing it.
-It hurts!

20:23.799 --> 20:27.319
-How can it hurt, love?
-They send people to jail for that, honey.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.400
Today we're going
to record the theme song.

20:37.720 --> 20:40.319
-How spontaneous.
-Do you wanna add anything?

20:40.440 --> 20:43.799
You were so spontaneous
that I don't want to add anything else.

20:43.920 --> 20:44.920
Exactly.

20:45.759 --> 20:48.519
I'm super anxious today because

20:48.559 --> 20:52.960
recording the theme song
means leaving my comfort zone.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.279
We're ready.

20:54.319 --> 20:56.519
I only did it once with Baby K.

20:57.079 --> 20:59.759
I was less nervous, and it came out well.

21:00.319 --> 21:01.960
I don't know how it'll go,

21:02.039 --> 21:04.240
because the pitch is very high for me

21:04.319 --> 21:06.640
and I'm not very good at singing, so...

21:07.200 --> 21:08.440
Hello, how are you?

21:08.960 --> 21:10.519
-Good, and you?
-Good.

21:10.559 --> 21:13.519
I liked that kind of "Grease" vibe

21:13.559 --> 21:18.559
they gave to it, but the initial lyrics
didn't make much sense.

21:18.640 --> 21:23.319
-Baby, I have some variants on the hook.
-I lost the thing.

21:23.440 --> 21:28.200
The original lyrics read,
"Chiara thought I was a gigolo."

21:29.319 --> 21:32.559
-Can you explain?
-So, wait, I have the two lyrics.

21:32.680 --> 21:35.799
"I texted Chiara, but she thought
I was a bot."

21:36.240 --> 21:38.519
-It's not bad.
-It doesn't make sense.

21:38.559 --> 21:40.960
"Chiara thought I was rock'n'roll,"
and you,

21:41.039 --> 21:42.079
"But he's not."

21:42.559 --> 21:44.200
This is acceptable.

21:44.279 --> 21:47.400
Otherwise, I wanted to put something
about "the dog..."

21:47.480 --> 21:49.319
That would make more sense.

21:49.480 --> 21:53.039
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

21:53.160 --> 21:55.079
I think it's funnier like this.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.000
-How do you write...
-"Bow tie."

21:57.079 --> 22:00.160
We changed the first verse.
Is it called a verse?

22:00.240 --> 22:02.920
Because our followers know
how it all started,

22:03.039 --> 22:05.960
thanks to a piece of his song,

22:06.039 --> 22:09.880
so it has to do with my dog,
a bow tie, et cetera. So we put that

22:10.240 --> 22:11.920
for those who know us well.

22:12.279 --> 22:13.400
Moët & Chandon

22:13.480 --> 22:16.599
-Random.
-No, something like, "How about that."

22:16.680 --> 22:18.799
Yes! Wow! Oh, holy shit!

22:19.200 --> 22:23.680
She's the new Mogol, bloody hell! Yes!
"How about that," that's it, done.

22:23.759 --> 22:25.200
Well, it's not...

22:25.279 --> 22:27.720
Perfect, love. Colloquial, beautiful.

22:27.799 --> 22:30.599
The earnings of this hit
will be split fifty-fifty.

22:31.240 --> 22:32.640
So now he sings his parts?

22:32.720 --> 22:36.440
Yes, so then you can hear them
and overdub yours.

22:36.559 --> 22:38.359
One, two, three, Winnie the Pooh!

22:38.440 --> 22:40.400
-God.
-When you want. We're ready.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.480
Okay, go.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.039
Chia...

22:46.119 --> 22:47.680
Can you raise my voice?

22:47.759 --> 22:50.440
I'll lower the base and raise the voice.

22:50.519 --> 22:54.279
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

22:54.960 --> 22:58.720
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

22:59.480 --> 23:03.200
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

23:05.680 --> 23:07.680
And the show begins

23:07.759 --> 23:10.839
The Ferragnez

23:11.680 --> 23:15.559
-Did he have the autotune?
-Yes. But very light.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.599
I want it very strong, though.

23:18.200 --> 23:19.200
Okay.

23:19.279 --> 23:22.319
It's light and funny.
It's a theme song, right?

23:22.400 --> 23:23.759
-What's wrong?
-I'm nervous.

23:24.079 --> 23:28.240
You're not with Claudio Villa!
Come on, you see I suck too.

23:28.319 --> 23:29.319
All right.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.000
Will you come over there with me?

23:35.119 --> 23:37.000
Are you ashamed? Love!

23:37.079 --> 23:40.480
-There are a lot of people!
-How did you do the one with Baby K?

23:40.559 --> 23:42.319
-I was drunk.
-Were you?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.720
-You're pregnant now, you can't.
-Exactly.

23:44.799 --> 23:47.000
-Let's remove some bass tones.
-It was fun.

23:47.079 --> 23:50.839
She was a good coach.
We drank champagne before recording.

23:50.920 --> 23:54.480
-Oh, God.
-I was super chill.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.039
You need to have fun, love.

23:57.119 --> 23:59.880
Come on,
nothing is gonna happen, trust me.

24:01.759 --> 24:04.720
How do I sing?
Can you already put the autotune?

24:05.000 --> 24:06.480
-Autotune.
-Ready.

24:06.559 --> 24:07.599
Help.

24:07.680 --> 24:10.000
-What do I do now?
-Sing.

24:10.079 --> 24:12.119
-Okay, shall I start?
-No, wait!

24:12.200 --> 24:14.440
-I'm scared.
-Just try. Listen to me, go.

24:15.039 --> 24:17.640
-Let's do it together.
-But I can't hear it.

24:18.720 --> 24:22.000
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

24:22.079 --> 24:23.440
How about that

24:24.119 --> 24:26.079
How about that

24:26.160 --> 24:27.519
I can't do it that high!

24:27.599 --> 24:28.799
How about that

24:28.880 --> 24:31.519
You're a woman.
For me it's too high, I'm a baritone.

24:32.079 --> 24:35.759
-I don't know what that means!
-That I have a lower voice.

24:35.839 --> 24:37.799
How about that

24:37.880 --> 24:40.079
-Exactly.
-Push it a little bit more.

24:41.359 --> 24:42.400
Don't think.

24:43.519 --> 24:46.839
Everything started
With a dog and a bow tie

24:46.920 --> 24:48.119
How about that

24:54.839 --> 24:56.920
-Come here.
-You are not...

24:58.799 --> 25:00.599
It wasn't bad. Believe in it.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.799
-Well...
-You need to believe in it.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.799
If she believed a little a bit more,
she would rock.

25:05.920 --> 25:11.400
She gets nervous, it's fair. I get nervous
and I've been doing this for years.

25:12.039 --> 25:13.480
How about that

25:13.559 --> 25:16.559
And now we're expanding the family
A little more

25:16.640 --> 25:18.119
Like a yo-yo

25:18.200 --> 25:21.400
Because every time you kiss me
You knock me out

25:21.480 --> 25:25.799
So kiss me, silly
And the show begins

25:25.880 --> 25:27.480
The Ferragnez

25:27.559 --> 25:29.559
-Okay!
-Good.

25:29.640 --> 25:31.559
-Let's go listen.
-Let's go.

25:31.880 --> 25:34.279
God, it's too hard doing this stuff.

25:35.319 --> 25:38.200
Why can't I sing? I wanted to be a singer.

25:38.279 --> 25:41.599
What if we ask Arisa to sing?
We say it's Chiara.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.720
-It wasn't easy.
-No, it wasn't!

25:44.799 --> 25:45.720
You rocked.

25:47.599 --> 25:49.279
-Nice!
-Well, so-so.

25:49.920 --> 25:52.119
We need to understand
if you're out of tune.

25:57.799 --> 25:59.200
They sound like sirens.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.160
Oh God, come on!

26:04.720 --> 26:08.079
I got this award for the theme song
before it even came out

26:08.160 --> 26:11.319
and this shows my potential as a singer.

26:11.640 --> 26:14.359
Let's avoid giving spoilers
about this one too.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.759
-No!
-No, I can't believe it.

26:18.839 --> 26:20.519
I'll delete it right away.

26:20.599 --> 26:23.119
-You made me press with my finger!
-I didn't!

26:23.200 --> 26:24.720
Fuck!

26:24.799 --> 26:27.119
-He was about to--
-No! I'm deleting it.

26:27.839 --> 26:31.160
All good, guys, all good. Nobody saw it.

26:32.079 --> 26:35.039
Now I'll have my revenge
because Fede will try

26:35.119 --> 26:39.000
the pain of childbirth,
even if I don't think it will be

26:39.240 --> 26:44.279
as devastating and painful as the real
thing, but he'll get an idea, at least.

26:44.359 --> 26:45.559
Okay.

26:45.640 --> 26:51.359
Another couple of friends of mine,
Lorenzo and Martina, will try it too.

26:51.440 --> 26:55.559
-Are you nervous?
-No, I don't know what I have to do.

26:55.640 --> 26:56.799
Suffer.

26:56.880 --> 27:02.359
Martina is expecting twin girls.
She's a close friend of mine, it'll be fun

27:02.480 --> 27:04.720
to see who will handle it better.

27:04.839 --> 27:07.720
I think Lorenzo will win,
Fede can't take much pain.

27:07.839 --> 27:09.119
Hello!

27:09.200 --> 27:10.960
-Hello, love!
-How are you?

27:11.039 --> 27:12.319
Good.

27:12.400 --> 27:15.319
-Are you ready, Lori?
-Super ready.

27:15.400 --> 27:18.000
-You can't run away, you're gonna do it.
-You sure?

27:18.079 --> 27:21.440
-What the fuck are we supposed to do?
-Assimilate their pain.

27:21.559 --> 27:23.319
Which will never be like ours.

27:23.400 --> 27:24.880
Yeah, we'll see.

27:24.960 --> 27:26.400
-There we go.
-Please.

27:26.480 --> 27:28.119
-Hello.
-Hi!

27:28.200 --> 27:30.200
-Welcome.
-Thank you so much.

27:30.279 --> 27:33.000
-Thank you. Hi, everyone.
-Wow!

27:33.079 --> 27:37.480
Is this a service you offer
to make men feel the pain of childbirth?

27:37.559 --> 27:42.039
Exactly. For this treatment
you should wear the scrubs on the beds.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.400
I love it.

27:43.920 --> 27:46.640
I love all of this. So cool.

27:47.039 --> 27:52.119
-I've never felt this pain. You did.
-I did, with the contractions.

27:52.200 --> 27:55.000
-Okay, I'm turning the machine on.
-No, hey!

27:55.079 --> 27:57.160
He hasn't attached it to you yet.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.440
This will be divided in three phases.

27:59.519 --> 28:04.279
The first phase will simulate
the preparatory contractions,

28:04.359 --> 28:09.839
the second phase will be the start of the
labor, with slightly longer contractions,

28:09.920 --> 28:15.920
and in the last phase the contraction will
be even longer, and closer to one another.

28:16.119 --> 28:17.799
And much stronger.

28:17.880 --> 28:21.119
Okay, we can proceed
with the electrode application.

28:21.200 --> 28:26.079
-When I had them, you were sleeping.
-It was night! What was I supposed to do?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.799
On the couch, sleeping.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.759
-Can you sit up, please?
-Yes.

28:29.839 --> 28:32.599
It's only fair
that he takes his share, now.

28:32.680 --> 28:34.640
-Come on, love.
-Okay.

28:34.720 --> 28:38.720
-You can lay back down.
-I'll take some souvenir pictures of you.

28:39.599 --> 28:43.519
-Lori, any comments?
-Let's just hope it all goes well.

28:43.640 --> 28:49.200
-Let's hope it's a girl.
-No, wait a minute, guys. I'd like...

28:49.720 --> 28:52.559
-Can't I see what happens to him first?
-Fuck no!

28:52.640 --> 28:56.400
-If anything, the other way around.
-Is it simultaneous?

28:56.480 --> 28:57.519
Simultaneous? No!

28:58.119 --> 28:59.279
Let's hold hands.

29:00.400 --> 29:03.359
-No, guys, I can't do it!
-Come on, don't be--

29:03.440 --> 29:06.440
-I'm having a panic attack.
-Don't panic, jeez!

29:06.519 --> 29:10.720
When you give birth,
I'll treat you like this. Come here.

29:10.799 --> 29:12.920
-What do I have to do?
-Give me support.

29:13.000 --> 29:15.720
-I'm starting to feel...
-It's already started.

29:15.799 --> 29:17.160
No, oh!

29:17.240 --> 29:22.720
-Ouch, you're hurting my hand, Lorenzo.
-He's also ice cold.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.240
-Nice start, isn't it?
-What the fuck are we doing?

29:35.799 --> 29:37.160
We poor women.

29:37.720 --> 29:41.039
-This really makes you empathize.
-You can do it, you're a beast!

29:41.119 --> 29:42.880
-Like you told me.
-Okay.

29:43.279 --> 29:44.640
Which phase is this one?

29:44.720 --> 29:47.680
-The second one.
-The first phase of labor begins.

29:47.759 --> 29:50.240
Come on. Labor. Come on, love.

29:50.319 --> 29:52.920
-No, please!
-What do you feel?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.880
-Now it's a bit stronger than before.
-Fucking hell!

29:58.200 --> 30:01.480
-How fucking long does it last?
-Make sure you breathe.

30:01.559 --> 30:04.079
-Breathe, love.
-But it's lasting so long.

30:04.160 --> 30:06.240
With Chiara they didn't last this long!

30:06.319 --> 30:09.039
-They last longer than one minute!
-It's not true.

30:09.799 --> 30:12.799
-Son of a bitch!
-Come on, honey.

30:14.079 --> 30:17.440
-Think about what you're creating.
-It hurts more when I laugh!

30:18.640 --> 30:21.119
You're hurting me, Lore, fuck!

30:27.599 --> 30:29.920
Come on, guys, we're nearly there!

30:30.839 --> 30:34.000
It's a mix of humiliation and pain.

30:34.079 --> 30:35.640
It's horrible.

30:40.160 --> 30:41.519
But what is--

30:42.079 --> 30:44.200
No, no, no!

30:44.640 --> 30:46.359
No! I can't do it.

30:46.440 --> 30:47.839
-Come on!
-Gimme your hand.

30:47.920 --> 30:50.200
-You're a man.
-This one is stronger!

30:50.279 --> 30:54.920
You're hurting me, no, Lorenzo,
you're hurting me, ouch!

30:55.000 --> 30:59.440
-Aren't we done with this fucking labor?
-Last one.

30:59.519 --> 31:01.319
-Go, breathe.
-Don't blow!

31:01.400 --> 31:03.880
-What the fuck are you blowing?
-I'm not!

31:03.960 --> 31:05.480
-Come on, honey!
-Breathe.

31:05.559 --> 31:09.359
-Now there's the ejection.
-We'll prep you for phase three.

31:09.440 --> 31:13.559
It's going to simulate the last pushes,
the ones that are a bit lower.

31:13.640 --> 31:16.079
-We're ready.
-Give birth to these creatures.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.440
No, no, no!

31:20.519 --> 31:24.119
-Stop! I can't do it.
-It's nature, you can't say stop!

31:26.920 --> 31:31.400
I can't do it, I can't... Fuck!

31:31.759 --> 31:35.000
-No, honey, I can't do it.
-Come on, honey, come on!

31:36.160 --> 31:37.839
This thing is not gonna air.

31:40.039 --> 31:42.680
Come on, honey, I can see the head!

31:42.759 --> 31:44.960
-Give it all now.
-I can't do it anymore.

31:45.039 --> 31:48.240
-Come on, honey.
-No! Stop!

31:48.319 --> 31:54.279
Stop, stop! If you make it stronger
I'll pull everything off.

31:54.359 --> 31:56.519
-Come on!
-Fuck off!

32:01.680 --> 32:04.960
-Well done, honey!
-Fist bump, bro! Let's be men.

32:05.599 --> 32:08.720
-Well done.
-Good job, you gave birth!

32:09.119 --> 32:09.960
How was it?

32:10.039 --> 32:11.799
Terrible, fuck!

32:11.880 --> 32:13.319
-Damn!
-You did great.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.440
You both got to the end.

32:15.519 --> 32:16.640
Yes, exactly.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.799
I'll remove the ones on the back.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.559
-We came out well, Lore.
-Yes.

32:20.640 --> 32:24.519
I'm sure
I had a very dignified labor reaction.

32:24.680 --> 32:26.279
Love, turn around.

32:27.119 --> 32:30.039
-Guys, you were amazing.
-Thanks.

32:33.640 --> 32:36.359
After realizing
that you can support each other

32:36.440 --> 32:40.480
and that you can put yourself
in each other's shoes, I have a proposal.

32:41.079 --> 32:44.720
I'd like to meet you individually
next time.

32:44.799 --> 32:47.599
I'd like to be able
to meet only with you, Chiara,

32:47.680 --> 32:50.880
and have the opportunity
to speak only with you, Federico.

32:51.319 --> 32:53.480
And I think we'll have fun.

32:55.680 --> 32:57.039
-Okay.
-All right.

32:57.119 --> 32:59.440
-All right?
-Thank you so much.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.279
-Thank you.
-No crying today.

33:01.359 --> 33:02.559
No crying today.

33:04.720 --> 33:05.920
Go, team!

33:11.400 --> 33:12.519
There's a surprise.

33:12.599 --> 33:14.920
-Who is this little boy?
-Is it Leo?

33:16.880 --> 33:19.200
I hope I don't give birth during Sanremo.

33:19.279 --> 33:22.000
-Let's hope so.
-Careful, she's pooping!

33:22.079 --> 33:28.000
I'm proud of the parent I am. I can be
a parent. I can't wait for her to be born.

33:28.079 --> 33:30.160
Wow, great!

33:30.240 --> 33:31.960
Fede is setting off for Sanremo.

33:32.039 --> 33:34.319
I'm totally shitting myself.

33:34.400 --> 33:36.599
Bye, daddy, we love you so much.
