01:57.735 --> 01:59.612
I love you, Billy.

02:03.532 --> 02:05.868
I love you too, Mommy.

02:12.249 --> 02:13.584
Night-night.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.297
Sleep tight.

02:21.217 --> 02:23.677
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

02:25.471 --> 02:28.891
I'll see you in the morning light.

02:39.735 --> 02:41.445
I love you.

03:03.467 --> 03:06.720
They're going to make me an assistant
art director. So Kenny says:

03:06.929 --> 03:09.431
"You get yourself a Burberry coat.

03:09.723 --> 03:13.310
If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to look it."

03:13.561 --> 03:16.063
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's cold.

03:16.355 --> 03:19.358
I go to this place
that specializes in Burberrys...

03:19.650 --> 03:22.319
...and say, " I want a Burberry coat,
37 short."

03:22.611 --> 03:25.447
They put it on,
and I look beautiful in it.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.907
I say, " I'll buy it."

03:27.157 --> 03:29.326
And right then, I start to sweat.

03:29.577 --> 03:33.622
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

03:33.914 --> 03:35.708
...because I'm so scared.

03:35.958 --> 03:37.418
- Good night.
- Where you going?

03:37.668 --> 03:41.463
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

03:41.714 --> 03:43.007
Okay, so let me finish.

03:43.299 --> 03:45.801
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking...

03:47.344 --> 03:50.931
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

03:51.181 --> 03:55.477
- Come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.

03:55.728 --> 03:58.397
Gotta talk to you
about something important.

03:58.689 --> 04:02.109
I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.

04:23.964 --> 04:27.051
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.554
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

04:30.804 --> 04:32.681
...they'll offer me a partnership.

04:32.890 --> 04:34.266
That's terrific!

04:34.475 --> 04:38.854
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

04:40.189 --> 04:44.109
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.629
Joanna.

05:04.296 --> 05:06.006
I'm home.

05:09.093 --> 05:12.429
I forgot my keys. I gotta call
the office before they go.

05:12.680 --> 05:16.183
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

05:18.686 --> 05:21.605
- Ted.
- One second. Let me just do this.

05:25.276 --> 05:28.529
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

05:28.779 --> 05:30.823
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

05:31.115 --> 05:34.910
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

05:35.202 --> 05:37.872
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear.

05:39.582 --> 05:42.418
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.503
Did you guys eat?

05:44.753 --> 05:45.629
I'm leaving you.

05:48.757 --> 05:50.467
Here are my keys.

05:50.759 --> 05:53.846
Here's my American Express,
my Bloomingdale's card...

05:54.096 --> 05:57.933
...my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.394
That's what I had when we got married.

06:00.686 --> 06:03.439
- Is this a joke?
- Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

06:03.689 --> 06:05.816
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.527
- You. You have to pick them up.
- What's wrong?

06:08.819 --> 06:12.573
I paid the rent, the Con Ed bill,
and the phone bill, so...

06:12.865 --> 06:14.575
You really pick your times to...

06:18.829 --> 06:22.666
I'm sorry I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

06:23.500 --> 06:26.754
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

06:27.004 --> 06:29.089
So that's everything.

06:34.345 --> 06:36.055
Enough, enough. All right?

06:36.305 --> 06:38.265
What are you doing?

06:38.599 --> 06:42.186
Where are you going? Just tell me
what I did that's so terrible.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.729
- It's not you.
- Then what?

06:44.021 --> 06:46.023
It's me. It's my fault.

06:46.523 --> 06:47.983
You married the wrong person.

06:48.234 --> 06:50.653
- I can't hack it.
- Let's just go inside.

06:50.945 --> 06:52.947
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

06:53.239 --> 06:56.075
Joanna, please, just... I'm sorry.

06:56.367 --> 07:01.455
- No, please don't make me go in there.
- I just want to talk.

07:01.747 --> 07:04.250
If you do, I swear, one day...

07:04.500 --> 07:07.002
...l'll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.547
Come on, now. What about Billy?

07:13.509 --> 07:16.887
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

07:17.429 --> 07:18.806
I'm terrible with him.

07:19.098 --> 07:21.934
I have no patience.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.186
He's better off without me.

07:26.397 --> 07:27.856
Joanna, please.

07:32.736 --> 07:35.030
And I don't love you anymore.

07:37.032 --> 07:38.993
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

08:13.444 --> 08:16.780
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

08:16.989 --> 08:20.159
Yeah. Joanna come in?

08:20.409 --> 08:24.705
We had a little fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

08:24.914 --> 08:28.250
If she comes in, tell her to come up
or just give me a ring.

08:30.127 --> 08:34.256
Don't worry. She didn't take
her suitcase. She won't get very far.

08:35.466 --> 08:38.802
I got work to do.
If she comes in, tell her to call me.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.436
It's about time.

08:50.481 --> 08:53.317
Joanna, that's the most insensitive...
Hi, Margaret.

08:53.609 --> 08:57.404
- She packed a suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.

08:57.696 --> 08:59.657
She tell you where she was going?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.660
- You tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

09:02.910 --> 09:06.413
Clearly, you two had many
talks about my shortcomings...

09:06.622 --> 09:09.625
...which I haven't been privy to.
And I'd love to talk...

09:09.917 --> 09:13.170
...but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

09:13.420 --> 09:16.257
...and I gotta get my work done.
So please allow me...

09:16.507 --> 09:19.093
You don't realize
we have a serious problem.

09:19.343 --> 09:22.263
Wrong. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

09:22.555 --> 09:24.890
...go out the door and go back to bed.

09:25.349 --> 09:27.851
- The fact is...
- For six months...

09:28.143 --> 09:31.689
...l've been spitting blood to get
this agency its biggest account.

09:31.981 --> 09:34.024
And at five, we got it.

09:34.858 --> 09:39.321
At eight, the vice president tells me
I'll be the next creative director.

09:39.572 --> 09:42.116
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

09:42.366 --> 09:46.036
...one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me...

09:46.328 --> 09:48.914
...and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me!

09:54.461 --> 09:57.047
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

09:59.049 --> 10:02.469
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

10:06.432 --> 10:08.767
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

10:09.059 --> 10:11.020
Thanks very much, really.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.273
Sisterhood.

10:14.523 --> 10:16.734
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but...

10:17.067 --> 10:19.028
I didn't come to cheer you up.

10:19.278 --> 10:21.155
I'm concerned about Joanna.

10:21.739 --> 10:25.242
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

10:26.243 --> 10:30.539
Joanna and I never had any problems
until you and Charley split up.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.791
Oh, I don't believe you.

10:33.042 --> 10:34.835
Just tell me the truth, okay?

10:35.085 --> 10:36.712
Did you set her up to this?

10:37.004 --> 10:38.881
No, I didn't put her up to this.

10:39.173 --> 10:41.550
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I didn't.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.802
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

10:44.094 --> 10:46.180
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

10:46.472 --> 10:50.935
And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.

10:51.185 --> 10:54.188
How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?

12:08.512 --> 12:09.889
Where's Mommy?

12:10.180 --> 12:11.807
- What?
- Where's Mommy?

12:12.016 --> 12:13.475
What time is it?

12:14.727 --> 12:19.523
The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

12:21.358 --> 12:26.405
Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

12:26.655 --> 12:29.992
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.

12:30.201 --> 12:32.161
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

12:32.369 --> 12:36.040
You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?

12:36.290 --> 12:38.876
And you want to go and be alone
for a while?

12:39.126 --> 12:41.795
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

12:42.004 --> 12:45.758
...and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.

12:46.008 --> 12:48.302
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.

12:48.594 --> 12:52.056
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

12:52.348 --> 12:54.475
- What do you want?
- French toast.

12:54.850 --> 12:56.810
You want French toast, you got it.

12:57.061 --> 13:00.231
Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

13:00.481 --> 13:03.484
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

13:03.776 --> 13:04.777
We got milk.

13:05.069 --> 13:06.445
We got butter.

13:06.737 --> 13:08.531
We got $5.

13:08.739 --> 13:11.200
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

13:12.034 --> 13:14.787
Okay, can you be my number one helper?

13:16.622 --> 13:17.790
Watch this. One hand.

13:18.624 --> 13:20.000
Here we go.

13:20.209 --> 13:23.045
Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?

13:23.295 --> 13:26.465
Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

13:26.674 --> 13:29.134
- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.

13:29.593 --> 13:33.013
Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?

13:33.222 --> 13:37.059
Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.

13:37.351 --> 13:39.311
- What time is school?
- 8:30.

13:39.562 --> 13:43.691
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

13:43.983 --> 13:45.025
I got people to see.

13:45.317 --> 13:47.820
And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon...

13:48.070 --> 13:49.530
...and he's gotta cook it.

13:49.989 --> 13:52.992
We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the...?

13:53.409 --> 13:55.536
- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.373
First, we need a nice fire.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.334
No, you're not doing it right.

14:02.626 --> 14:06.046
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.

14:06.297 --> 14:08.173
So the gucky part dissolves.

14:08.382 --> 14:12.136
Then you take the bread, and we...

14:12.428 --> 14:14.054
We...

14:15.055 --> 14:18.142
We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.

14:18.434 --> 14:21.937
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.900
When you're having a good time
you forget things.

14:26.609 --> 14:29.778
I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.

14:30.362 --> 14:33.824
Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

14:34.116 --> 14:35.576
I don't like it in pieces.

14:35.826 --> 14:39.872
It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

14:40.206 --> 14:42.541
Besides, French toast
is always folded.

14:42.833 --> 14:46.003
In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.

14:46.337 --> 14:48.214
You get more bites that way.

14:50.049 --> 14:53.219
And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.

14:53.510 --> 14:55.054
You having a good time?

14:55.304 --> 14:58.849
I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.727
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

15:01.977 --> 15:04.355
- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.

15:04.647 --> 15:06.774
Mommy always makes it too weak.

15:08.984 --> 15:10.945
Can I have some orange juice?

15:11.779 --> 15:14.073
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

15:16.617 --> 15:18.077
Daddy, it's burning!

15:18.869 --> 15:20.496
- What?
- It's burning!

15:22.456 --> 15:25.459
Damn it! Goddamn her!

15:28.587 --> 15:30.297
Oh, shit.

15:32.550 --> 15:36.262
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.

15:36.554 --> 15:38.013
Just...

15:39.431 --> 15:42.601
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

15:46.355 --> 15:47.731
- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.

15:48.023 --> 15:50.526
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.

15:50.818 --> 15:54.154
- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.

15:54.363 --> 15:56.240
- What if you forget?
- I won't.

15:56.490 --> 15:59.827
- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.

16:00.077 --> 16:02.204
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

16:02.454 --> 16:04.957
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

16:05.207 --> 16:07.543
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!

16:08.377 --> 16:09.753
Taxi!

16:12.590 --> 16:15.426
- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.

16:15.718 --> 16:19.096
- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

16:19.346 --> 16:21.640
- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.

16:21.932 --> 16:24.310
Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...

16:24.602 --> 16:27.855
- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.

16:28.564 --> 16:29.940
- Did my wife call?
- No.

16:30.232 --> 16:33.485
You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.

17:04.724 --> 17:07.978
She's never gone this far before,
but in the past...

17:08.229 --> 17:11.065
...l've known
when she's upset because...

17:11.315 --> 17:12.942
...she gets very quiet.

17:13.233 --> 17:16.737
Our pattern has been that I've said,
"What's the matter?"...

17:16.987 --> 17:18.864
...and she'll kind of sit on it.

17:19.156 --> 17:22.159
But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months...

17:22.409 --> 17:26.329
...since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

17:26.622 --> 17:31.961
And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...

17:32.503 --> 17:36.090
I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:

17:36.298 --> 17:38.425
" I'm as important as your work."

17:40.719 --> 17:42.763
Is there another guy?

17:44.807 --> 17:47.560
I don't think so.
She's not the type.

17:47.810 --> 17:50.646
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

17:51.397 --> 17:55.693
...you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

17:56.735 --> 17:57.736
It worked.

17:59.113 --> 18:00.489
I'm going crazy!

18:00.781 --> 18:02.950
Look, not to worry.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.743
She'll be back.

18:04.994 --> 18:07.329
I didn't know it would happen to me!

18:08.372 --> 18:09.832
Don't let it get you down.

18:10.124 --> 18:13.544
I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.

18:16.171 --> 18:19.008
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

18:21.927 --> 18:23.804
What are you gonna do about Billy?

18:25.598 --> 18:29.518
This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

18:29.768 --> 18:31.979
It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

18:32.229 --> 18:34.815
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

18:35.107 --> 18:38.277
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

18:38.986 --> 18:43.032
May sound a little rough, but...

18:43.324 --> 18:47.620
...I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

18:48.078 --> 18:50.497
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

18:51.373 --> 18:53.626
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

18:56.962 --> 18:58.672
Gee, I don't know...

18:58.923 --> 19:00.466
Ted, listen to me.

19:00.716 --> 19:05.971
I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

19:06.222 --> 19:10.768
You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.

19:11.060 --> 19:15.356
There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

19:15.564 --> 19:18.943
This is important. Don't blow this.

19:19.235 --> 19:23.030
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

19:23.572 --> 19:27.618
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

19:27.910 --> 19:31.330
I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

19:31.705 --> 19:35.543
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

19:35.793 --> 19:37.670
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.756
I never let anything at home
come into the office.

19:41.048 --> 19:43.300
You asked me to unload in this office.

19:43.592 --> 19:47.221
When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.

19:47.471 --> 19:49.848
I'm a survivor.

19:50.140 --> 19:53.894
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

19:55.479 --> 19:56.855
Okay?

19:59.149 --> 20:02.069
Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta...

20:02.319 --> 20:04.530
...blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.

20:04.822 --> 20:06.448
I'm all right!

20:06.657 --> 20:08.117
You don't worry.

20:08.367 --> 20:09.743
Thank you.

20:10.703 --> 20:12.913
I love you, you bastard.

20:17.751 --> 20:20.421
Daddy?

20:20.713 --> 20:22.506
Daddy?

20:25.676 --> 20:29.346
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

20:29.638 --> 20:32.391
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

20:32.641 --> 20:36.854
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

20:38.272 --> 20:40.399
Time to get a new fence.

20:43.861 --> 20:46.530
Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.

20:46.947 --> 20:48.199
Daddy! Daddy!

20:49.116 --> 20:50.409
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

20:50.659 --> 20:53.913
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

20:54.163 --> 20:56.832
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

20:57.082 --> 21:00.544
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

21:01.337 --> 21:02.796
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

21:03.005 --> 21:05.674
Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

21:06.550 --> 21:07.718
Sorry.

21:08.677 --> 21:11.847
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

21:12.097 --> 21:14.308
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

21:14.558 --> 21:18.479
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?

21:19.980 --> 21:23.150
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

21:28.739 --> 21:31.909
It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?

21:37.665 --> 21:40.251
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

21:45.756 --> 21:48.592
- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.

21:48.884 --> 21:49.885
All right.

21:50.177 --> 21:53.430
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

21:53.722 --> 21:56.725
- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.

22:01.355 --> 22:03.232
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

22:05.526 --> 22:06.819
All right, come on.

22:07.111 --> 22:09.655
Okay. That's it.

22:10.739 --> 22:12.783
We need some cereal.

22:13.617 --> 22:15.327
Okay, what colour?

22:25.045 --> 22:27.381
Hey, Billy!

22:27.631 --> 22:31.051
Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

22:31.343 --> 22:35.306
- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.

22:36.390 --> 22:39.059
Okay. Let's read it.

22:44.899 --> 22:47.651
" My dearest, sweet Billy."

22:50.196 --> 22:51.822
That's you.

22:54.116 --> 22:56.160
" Mommy has gone away.

22:56.452 --> 22:58.871
Sometimes in the world...

22:59.121 --> 23:00.414
...daddies go away...

23:00.706 --> 23:03.292
...and mommies bring up
their little boys.

23:03.584 --> 23:06.420
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

23:06.670 --> 23:09.757
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

23:10.049 --> 23:12.301
I have gone away
because I must find...

23:12.593 --> 23:16.430
...something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

23:16.722 --> 23:19.308
Everybody has to, and so do I.

23:23.270 --> 23:27.900
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

23:28.150 --> 23:31.070
...and this is what I have to do.

23:31.362 --> 23:33.739
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

23:34.031 --> 23:36.784
...and that is why
I'm writing you now.

23:37.034 --> 23:39.537
I will always be your mommy...

23:41.163 --> 23:43.499
...and I will always love you.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.710
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

23:47.002 --> 23:49.547
...but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

23:50.214 --> 23:54.051
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

23:59.640 --> 24:01.267
We'll read this another time.

24:01.475 --> 24:02.935
I don't care.

25:14.340 --> 25:16.217
- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.

25:16.634 --> 25:18.802
- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.

25:19.053 --> 25:22.765
What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

25:23.015 --> 25:24.058
Can you believe it?

25:24.350 --> 25:27.102
Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.

25:27.311 --> 25:29.271
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

25:29.813 --> 25:31.357
Tell you something funny.

25:31.607 --> 25:33.234
Gotta go. See you Monday.

25:38.531 --> 25:40.074
Taxi!

25:41.033 --> 25:42.493
Taxi!

25:45.704 --> 25:48.207
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

26:06.141 --> 26:08.894
Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.

26:09.144 --> 26:11.522
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

26:12.314 --> 26:14.275
Hey, how's it going, sport?

26:15.401 --> 26:18.737
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

26:19.029 --> 26:21.574
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

26:22.449 --> 26:25.452
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

26:25.744 --> 26:28.664
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

26:28.956 --> 26:30.583
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

26:30.791 --> 26:34.295
- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

26:34.545 --> 26:37.381
- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?

26:38.799 --> 26:41.635
All the other mothers were there
before you.

26:44.722 --> 26:48.225
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.

26:50.853 --> 26:54.440
If you want to be a big boy...

26:54.732 --> 26:58.569
...you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

26:58.861 --> 27:04.033
...you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for...

27:04.325 --> 27:07.244
...a long time afterwards.

27:07.494 --> 27:09.121
Okay, go ahead.

27:12.333 --> 27:15.085
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.

27:15.336 --> 27:18.505
You know better than that.
Here.

27:18.797 --> 27:20.174
Use a fork.

27:23.135 --> 27:26.055
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

27:26.931 --> 27:28.724
How was school today?

27:29.058 --> 27:30.851
Same as usual.

27:31.143 --> 27:33.354
I see the Knicks finally won a game.

27:33.604 --> 27:35.397
I don't care.

27:35.648 --> 27:37.191
What do you mean?

27:37.483 --> 27:40.486
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

27:40.945 --> 27:43.113
Because Mommy's from Boston.

27:47.743 --> 27:49.703
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

27:49.995 --> 27:52.998
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

27:53.249 --> 27:54.625
Too much birthday cake?

27:54.833 --> 27:56.460
Yeah, I guess.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.670
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

32:07.962 --> 32:09.213
Louise, give me a hand.

32:09.505 --> 32:10.881
You're 15 minutes late.

32:11.173 --> 32:13.634
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?

32:13.926 --> 32:17.972
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.

32:18.264 --> 32:21.600
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

32:21.892 --> 32:23.185
Okay, okay.

32:23.477 --> 32:24.311
Sorry I'm late.

32:24.603 --> 32:28.816
And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

32:31.569 --> 32:32.820
Right, thanks.

32:33.112 --> 32:35.781
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

32:38.075 --> 32:39.785
Know who Charley's seeing now?

32:40.077 --> 32:41.036
Who?

32:41.996 --> 32:45.583
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

32:45.833 --> 32:47.710
- Are you kidding?
- No.

32:47.960 --> 32:48.919
How do you know?

32:49.211 --> 32:51.005
I know.

32:51.297 --> 32:54.133
How long has it been since
you two broke up?

32:54.383 --> 32:55.301
Year and a half.

32:55.551 --> 32:57.761
That long?

32:58.012 --> 33:00.055
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

33:00.306 --> 33:03.309
...how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

33:04.351 --> 33:07.855
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

33:08.063 --> 33:10.316
You think you'll ever
get married again?

33:13.277 --> 33:15.154
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

33:15.446 --> 33:16.822
Why?

33:18.324 --> 33:21.785
Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but...

33:23.454 --> 33:27.583
...even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

33:27.833 --> 33:32.838
...sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again...

33:34.131 --> 33:35.758
...he's still my husband...

33:36.050 --> 33:39.136
...and he's still the father of my
children and...

33:41.013 --> 33:44.975
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

33:45.267 --> 33:48.854
Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis...

33:49.104 --> 33:53.067
...he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

33:53.317 --> 33:54.944
What would you do?

33:59.073 --> 34:04.036
I think that if he really loved me...

34:04.328 --> 34:06.705
...he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.092
You still think about him, don't you?

34:19.635 --> 34:21.679
Only all the time.

34:28.978 --> 34:31.438
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

34:33.983 --> 34:35.860
Liar.

34:38.112 --> 34:40.197
Some pair, boy.

34:41.699 --> 34:42.908
I don't believe it.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.536
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

34:45.828 --> 34:50.123
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.

34:50.331 --> 34:53.502
Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?

34:53.752 --> 34:55.462
You're not getting any better.

34:55.754 --> 34:56.797
What do you mean?

34:57.089 --> 35:02.303
Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

35:02.553 --> 35:03.762
I got a shop to run.

35:04.054 --> 35:07.641
I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.

35:08.058 --> 35:09.184
Okay?

35:13.230 --> 35:14.398
Yeah?

35:16.525 --> 35:17.651
Yeah, wait a minute.

35:17.943 --> 35:20.154
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

35:20.446 --> 35:22.740
Pick up 461.

35:25.367 --> 35:26.744
Yeah?

35:27.661 --> 35:30.039
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

35:30.664 --> 35:33.834
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

35:34.543 --> 35:35.669
No.

35:36.503 --> 35:40.424
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

35:40.716 --> 35:42.760
I can't talk now. I'm busy.

35:43.677 --> 35:47.431
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

35:47.681 --> 35:50.267
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

35:54.647 --> 35:56.190
I'm getting very nervous.

36:03.072 --> 36:05.282
Put that down and eat your dinner.

36:05.533 --> 36:06.909
What is this crap?

36:07.826 --> 36:10.037
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

36:10.287 --> 36:12.790
You had it last week and you loved it.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.502
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

36:16.752 --> 36:19.129
- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

36:19.463 --> 36:21.799
You are not.
You had this last week...

36:22.174 --> 36:26.053
...and I said it was my favourite and you
said, " It's my favourite too."

36:26.303 --> 36:28.013
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

36:29.223 --> 36:30.474
It's regular hamburger.

36:30.766 --> 36:32.393
Take a bite. It's delicious.

36:34.478 --> 36:35.437
What's the matter?

36:35.729 --> 36:37.106
I'm gonna throw up.

36:37.398 --> 36:39.441
- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.

36:39.692 --> 36:42.611
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

36:47.658 --> 36:50.494
Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?

36:51.745 --> 36:54.498
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home...

36:54.790 --> 36:58.210
...and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...

36:59.044 --> 37:01.338
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

37:01.589 --> 37:02.965
Did you hear me?

37:03.257 --> 37:04.383
You'd better not do that.

37:05.301 --> 37:07.970
You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.

37:11.015 --> 37:12.016
Did you hear me?

37:14.518 --> 37:17.688
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.

37:17.938 --> 37:20.357
Put that back until you finish
your dinner.

37:23.277 --> 37:26.197
If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.

37:28.490 --> 37:31.076
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

37:31.368 --> 37:33.162
You hear me? Hold it right there.

37:33.579 --> 37:38.500
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.

37:38.792 --> 37:42.046
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

37:42.254 --> 37:46.467
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

37:49.595 --> 37:50.763
You're hurting me!

37:51.513 --> 37:52.723
Don't you kick me.

37:53.766 --> 37:56.519
- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.

37:56.769 --> 37:59.021
You are a spoiled little brat!

37:59.313 --> 38:02.066
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

38:02.358 --> 38:05.694
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

38:06.946 --> 38:10.824
I want my mommy!

38:14.245 --> 38:16.830
I want my mommy!

38:22.962 --> 38:26.215
I want my mommy!

38:27.383 --> 38:29.176
Mommy...

39:22.855 --> 39:23.981
Daddy?

39:25.316 --> 39:26.233
Daddy?

39:26.609 --> 39:28.569
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

39:29.945 --> 39:31.197
I'm sorry too.

39:34.533 --> 39:37.369
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

39:38.996 --> 39:40.039
Daddy?

39:40.873 --> 39:41.999
Now what is it?

39:42.875 --> 39:44.251
Are you going away?

39:45.252 --> 39:46.086
No.

39:46.837 --> 39:50.257
I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.

39:50.716 --> 39:53.802
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

39:55.846 --> 39:57.223
Is that what you think?

39:58.933 --> 39:59.767
No.

40:01.227 --> 40:05.272
That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

40:05.523 --> 40:09.235
...and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.

40:11.362 --> 40:16.242
I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.

40:19.495 --> 40:21.997
I think the reason why Mommy left...

40:22.998 --> 40:24.708
...was because for a long time...

40:24.959 --> 40:30.047
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

40:30.923 --> 40:35.803
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

40:36.053 --> 40:39.139
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

40:40.391 --> 40:42.017
She just wasn't like that.

40:44.562 --> 40:49.608
I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy...

40:50.401 --> 40:53.863
...and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.

40:54.530 --> 40:58.826
But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

40:59.118 --> 41:01.328
...just thinking about myself.

41:02.079 --> 41:06.458
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

41:06.709 --> 41:10.921
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

41:12.631 --> 41:17.344
Mommy stayed here longer than she
wanted because she loves you so much.

41:18.804 --> 41:22.474
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

41:22.766 --> 41:25.019
...was because she couldn't stand me.

41:25.811 --> 41:28.731
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

41:44.622 --> 41:48.292
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

41:50.586 --> 41:51.420
Good night.

41:51.754 --> 41:54.423
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

41:54.673 --> 41:56.217
See you in the morning light.

41:56.967 --> 41:58.427
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

42:00.304 --> 42:01.847
I love you.

42:04.058 --> 42:05.601
I love you too.

42:23.953 --> 42:26.789
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

42:31.335 --> 42:33.337
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

42:34.004 --> 42:36.257
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

42:36.882 --> 42:40.844
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

42:41.595 --> 42:43.222
And ghostly ghosts.

42:43.639 --> 42:47.226
And wicked witches and spooky spooks.

43:01.198 --> 43:05.077
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

43:05.369 --> 43:09.248
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.

43:09.540 --> 43:13.210
I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

43:13.502 --> 43:15.045
All right, bye-bye.

43:15.671 --> 43:16.505
Hello, Kramer.

43:16.797 --> 43:18.966
Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?

43:19.216 --> 43:20.926
I think it's okay.

43:31.729 --> 43:32.605
Yes.

43:34.899 --> 43:36.150
Yes, what?

43:38.777 --> 43:40.237
I'll have dinner with you.

43:47.411 --> 43:48.454
Thank you.

43:49.205 --> 43:50.664
You're welcome.

44:15.022 --> 44:15.940
Oh, shit!

44:16.273 --> 44:17.900
- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

44:18.442 --> 44:19.276
I gotta go.

44:19.485 --> 44:22.571
- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.

44:22.780 --> 44:24.323
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

44:24.573 --> 44:26.909
That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.

44:27.493 --> 44:29.119
Yeah, you're right.

44:29.411 --> 44:34.291
These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...

44:36.418 --> 44:37.628
Hi.

44:39.505 --> 44:41.924
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

44:42.216 --> 44:43.050
Who?

44:43.259 --> 44:47.388
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.

44:49.014 --> 44:50.015
Oh, Jesus.

44:51.392 --> 44:55.062
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

44:55.354 --> 44:56.397
So do I.

44:59.316 --> 45:01.569
Well, it's really...

45:03.279 --> 45:04.905
It's nice seeing you and...

45:05.155 --> 45:06.323
- Bye.
- Bye.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.621
Kramer, I just met your son.

45:12.955 --> 45:17.251
Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.

45:17.918 --> 45:22.673
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your centre.

45:22.965 --> 45:24.592
Okay? How's it feel?

45:25.009 --> 45:25.843
Good.

45:26.135 --> 45:30.264
Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!

45:30.639 --> 45:33.976
Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!

45:35.019 --> 45:37.271
Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?

45:37.605 --> 45:39.690
- Good!
- You look great!

45:46.697 --> 45:48.949
Don't go too far!

45:51.911 --> 45:56.290
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.

45:56.540 --> 46:00.211
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad...

46:00.461 --> 46:02.588
...and he pushed over the table.

46:02.838 --> 46:03.714
Yeah?

46:04.006 --> 46:05.633
- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

46:05.883 --> 46:07.009
Then what happened?

46:07.259 --> 46:11.639
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.

46:11.889 --> 46:13.974
- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.

46:14.391 --> 46:15.309
Then what happened?

46:15.559 --> 46:17.728
I don't want to be late for school.

46:18.020 --> 46:19.980
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

46:21.774 --> 46:23.025
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

46:31.575 --> 46:32.952
Taxi!

46:35.496 --> 46:36.705
Hi.

46:45.589 --> 46:49.468
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

46:49.718 --> 46:51.262
Tell me where you were.

46:51.512 --> 46:52.471
Well...

46:53.848 --> 46:57.101
...my French professor finally
asked me out.

46:57.393 --> 46:59.520
- When?
- The other day.

46:59.895 --> 47:00.813
You had a date.

47:01.146 --> 47:03.190
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

47:03.440 --> 47:06.610
- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.

47:07.027 --> 47:08.737
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

47:09.029 --> 47:10.906
I find out he's married.

47:11.657 --> 47:13.701
He's deep in analysis.

47:14.869 --> 47:17.454
- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!

47:17.746 --> 47:20.291
...and all I can think of
while I sit there...

47:20.541 --> 47:23.627
...is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

47:23.961 --> 47:25.838
...to listen to his problems.

47:26.213 --> 47:28.757
Daddy! Daddy, look!

47:29.008 --> 47:31.135
- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

47:32.177 --> 47:33.637
Did you hear me?

47:39.602 --> 47:41.812
Hold it, hold it!

47:43.856 --> 47:45.983
It hurts, Daddy.

47:48.652 --> 47:50.696
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

47:55.826 --> 47:57.703
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

47:58.954 --> 48:00.331
Watch it!

48:03.000 --> 48:04.877
Daddy, please hurry.

48:05.544 --> 48:07.588
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.

48:07.880 --> 48:11.217
Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

48:19.892 --> 48:21.268
How did this happen?

48:21.519 --> 48:23.395
He fell off the jungle gym.

48:24.313 --> 48:25.523
He had a plane in his hand.

48:25.773 --> 48:27.024
I'm just about through.

48:27.274 --> 48:29.235
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.

48:29.443 --> 48:32.196
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

48:32.446 --> 48:33.822
Yeah. Can she come in?

48:34.114 --> 48:35.032
Margaret, come in.

48:35.741 --> 48:37.535
- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.

48:37.785 --> 48:40.621
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

48:40.955 --> 48:42.206
It's all right, darling.

48:42.540 --> 48:43.999
I'm just talking to the doctor.

48:45.167 --> 48:46.335
He'll be right back.

48:46.585 --> 48:47.503
I'm right here.

48:48.712 --> 48:49.755
Will he lose his eye?

48:50.005 --> 48:53.425
No, but I have to take some stitches.

48:53.717 --> 48:54.635
How many?

48:55.761 --> 48:56.971
- About 10.
- What?

48:57.263 --> 49:00.808
Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.

49:01.433 --> 49:04.270
This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.

49:04.478 --> 49:05.938
I want to be in there with him.

49:06.188 --> 49:08.858
- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.

49:09.400 --> 49:12.069
If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.

49:12.987 --> 49:15.239
Good boy. You're really brave.

49:25.708 --> 49:27.668
That was a big one.

49:34.091 --> 49:35.718
Stop it.

49:42.683 --> 49:47.771
Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

50:29.188 --> 50:29.980
How is he?

50:30.356 --> 50:33.442
He's okay. He's sleeping.

50:33.943 --> 50:36.153
It's okay. I can do that.

50:38.239 --> 50:40.991
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.

50:41.408 --> 50:42.868
I don't know what happened.

50:43.452 --> 50:46.997
One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.

50:48.249 --> 50:49.708
Come on, Margaret.

50:50.417 --> 50:53.254
Now listen, I want
to ask you a favour, okay?

50:54.129 --> 50:56.340
It's a big favour.

50:56.757 --> 51:00.261
If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will...

51:00.469 --> 51:02.972
...but if a building fell on me...

51:03.430 --> 51:07.393
...would you consider
taking care of Billy?

51:11.689 --> 51:15.192
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

51:15.442 --> 51:16.277
...and I...

51:17.236 --> 51:20.155
...can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.

51:20.823 --> 51:23.492
I know you'd be okay
with him because...

51:25.286 --> 51:26.996
...you're a good mother.

51:32.710 --> 51:34.712
You're a lousy dishwasher.

51:36.881 --> 51:38.841
- All right?
- Okay.

51:48.142 --> 51:49.768
You're all right.

52:04.283 --> 52:06.243
Louise, you want to get that?

52:09.079 --> 52:11.999
Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.

52:13.250 --> 52:14.793
Yes, who is this?

52:19.173 --> 52:20.132
Joanna.

52:39.388 --> 52:40.223
Hi.

52:41.807 --> 52:43.184
- Hi.
- How are you?

52:43.392 --> 52:44.685
You look great.

52:46.854 --> 52:48.231
- How's your...?
- What?

52:49.065 --> 52:51.984
- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?

52:52.276 --> 52:54.612
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

52:54.904 --> 52:56.072
No, really, it's great.

52:56.364 --> 52:58.658
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.

52:58.908 --> 52:59.951
- White wine.
- Wine.

53:00.910 --> 53:02.536
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

53:03.246 --> 53:06.916
He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.

53:07.333 --> 53:10.169
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.

53:10.378 --> 53:12.672
He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.

53:12.922 --> 53:15.258
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

53:15.550 --> 53:18.803
Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.

53:22.348 --> 53:26.561
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.

53:26.811 --> 53:28.187
He got so big.

53:28.396 --> 53:29.855
You've been watching him?

53:30.106 --> 53:32.233
I've been in New York for
about two months now.

53:32.483 --> 53:33.693
I didn't know that.

53:34.527 --> 53:35.987
Anyway...

53:36.529 --> 53:39.282
That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

53:40.157 --> 53:44.954
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

53:45.329 --> 53:46.956
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

53:47.206 --> 53:48.749
Yeah, I was.

53:49.208 --> 53:50.126
I was.

53:51.168 --> 53:53.296
Well, you look lovely now.

53:56.090 --> 53:58.050
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

53:58.342 --> 53:59.802
Go ahead.

54:04.098 --> 54:06.350
All my life I've felt like...

54:06.601 --> 54:09.770
...somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.

54:10.062 --> 54:13.941
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

54:14.483 --> 54:15.943
That's why I had to go away.

54:16.402 --> 54:19.572
In California, I think I found myself.

54:19.780 --> 54:21.324
I got myself a job.

54:21.699 --> 54:24.619
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

54:25.953 --> 54:30.416
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

54:30.625 --> 54:32.960
I learned a lot about myself.

54:34.378 --> 54:35.296
Such as?

54:37.465 --> 54:41.594
No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

54:46.766 --> 54:50.728
I've learned
that I love my little boy.

54:52.063 --> 54:55.233
And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.

54:55.483 --> 54:56.943
What do you mean?

54:59.612 --> 55:00.655
I want my son.

55:01.614 --> 55:02.698
You can't have him.

55:02.990 --> 55:05.243
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

55:05.534 --> 55:06.911
I'm not getting defensive.

55:07.370 --> 55:08.996
Who walked out 15 months ago?

55:09.288 --> 55:11.457
I don't care. I'm still his mother.

55:11.832 --> 55:13.000
From 3000 miles away.

55:13.251 --> 55:16.420
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

55:16.671 --> 55:18.464
I never stopped wanting him.

55:18.673 --> 55:20.299
What makes you sure he wants you?

55:20.716 --> 55:22.510
What makes you sure he doesn't?

55:24.011 --> 55:27.014
We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

55:27.223 --> 55:29.392
- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...

55:29.642 --> 55:32.812
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

55:33.145 --> 55:36.315
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.

55:36.607 --> 55:38.901
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.

55:39.193 --> 55:40.319
I'm sorry about this.

55:40.778 --> 55:42.405
Do what you have to do.

55:50.079 --> 55:53.749
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's "desertion. "

55:54.041 --> 55:59.171
I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

55:59.463 --> 56:03.676
There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.

56:04.552 --> 56:07.388
I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

56:07.597 --> 56:10.600
...who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.

56:10.892 --> 56:15.021
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

56:15.271 --> 56:18.774
That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough...

56:19.066 --> 56:22.320
...you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?

56:22.528 --> 56:23.529
Yes.

56:24.447 --> 56:26.574
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

56:28.492 --> 56:29.535
That's if we win.

56:29.911 --> 56:32.496
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

56:33.789 --> 56:34.790
I understand.

56:36.751 --> 56:38.794
Now, how old is the child again?

56:39.086 --> 56:40.630
My son is 7.

56:40.922 --> 56:42.548
- That's tough.
- Why?

56:42.840 --> 56:46.969
In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.

56:47.261 --> 56:48.471
She signed over custody.

56:48.763 --> 56:52.308
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

56:52.642 --> 56:54.435
Do me a favour, will you?

56:54.727 --> 56:57.563
There's something I find useful
in matters like this.

56:57.855 --> 57:01.817
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

57:02.109 --> 57:03.653
Write them and look at them.

57:05.363 --> 57:07.490
- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.

57:07.740 --> 57:09.033
And after that...

57:09.283 --> 57:12.954
...if you're really certain
you want to retain custody...

57:13.204 --> 57:17.750
...then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?

57:36.602 --> 57:40.106
I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.

57:40.398 --> 57:42.775
I love you with all my heart.

58:00.626 --> 58:02.169
Ted, you got a lunch?

58:02.503 --> 58:06.799
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...

58:07.091 --> 58:09.343
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

58:10.761 --> 58:11.929
Okay, you got it.

58:12.847 --> 58:15.766
So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

58:16.559 --> 58:18.769
...getting Billy ready for school.

58:19.061 --> 58:22.481
I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.

58:22.732 --> 58:25.151
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

58:25.443 --> 58:29.322
And he says, " Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight. "

58:29.614 --> 58:33.534
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose. "

58:35.870 --> 58:37.663
He was so cute. You know?

58:37.955 --> 58:38.873
You know, kids.

58:39.165 --> 58:41.125
It's delicious, want a taste?

58:41.375 --> 58:43.085
- I'm full.
- It's good.

58:43.336 --> 58:45.213
Listen, Ted...

58:45.463 --> 58:50.176
...I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

58:51.302 --> 58:54.764
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

58:55.056 --> 58:56.057
Why?

58:56.307 --> 58:58.684
They're not happy
with what we're doing.

58:59.977 --> 59:03.481
I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.

59:04.815 --> 59:06.692
I got Norman working on it.

59:06.943 --> 59:08.486
Norman?

59:11.447 --> 59:13.699
You taking me off the account?

59:15.785 --> 59:17.161
You don't like me anymore?

59:17.495 --> 59:19.372
It's not quite that simple.

59:22.166 --> 59:25.002
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.

59:29.215 --> 59:30.841
You're firing me?

59:32.593 --> 59:34.804
Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.

59:38.224 --> 59:39.058
Why?

59:39.267 --> 59:42.520
Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.

59:42.812 --> 59:46.857
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

59:47.108 --> 59:48.985
There wasn't anything I could do.

59:49.235 --> 59:51.445
I think it's better this way.

59:51.696 --> 59:52.822
If I took your stripes...

59:53.114 --> 59:57.910
...if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

59:58.160 --> 01:00:00.997
This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.

01:00:01.372 --> 01:00:03.875
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

01:00:04.166 --> 01:00:06.460
You know that we're going to court?

01:00:06.794 --> 01:00:10.047
Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?

01:00:10.756 --> 01:00:12.842
I understand that you're upset...

01:00:13.134 --> 01:00:16.888
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:19.390
I'm asking you.

01:00:19.640 --> 01:00:23.185
You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.

01:00:23.477 --> 01:00:27.315
You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.

01:00:27.648 --> 01:00:29.191
Teddy, look.

01:00:30.651 --> 01:00:32.778
I know you may be short on cash.

01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:35.448
No big hurry about paying this back.

01:00:35.865 --> 01:00:37.575
Shame on you.

01:01:30.127 --> 01:01:32.380
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

01:01:33.339 --> 01:01:34.465
- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.

01:01:34.715 --> 01:01:36.842
- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.

01:01:37.093 --> 01:01:38.719
John. What's happening?

01:01:38.970 --> 01:01:42.765
They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

01:01:43.015 --> 01:01:46.769
I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

01:01:49.814 --> 01:01:52.733
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

01:01:53.025 --> 01:01:56.612
We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.

01:01:57.738 --> 01:02:00.074
Yeah, listen, you tell that...

01:02:00.825 --> 01:02:03.911
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

01:02:04.203 --> 01:02:05.496
...that I want a delay.

01:02:05.788 --> 01:02:07.498
Sorry, it's really too late.

01:02:08.165 --> 01:02:10.585
- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?

01:02:10.877 --> 01:02:12.753
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

01:02:42.533 --> 01:02:45.203
This is the worst time
to look for work.

01:02:45.494 --> 01:02:49.081
It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.

01:02:49.332 --> 01:02:51.542
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.

01:02:51.834 --> 01:02:54.503
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

01:02:54.879 --> 01:02:57.381
If you could just look
in your card catalogue.

01:03:02.553 --> 01:03:04.347
I'll take anything.

01:03:07.475 --> 01:03:10.645
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.563
What is it?

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:14.482
Something in the art department.

01:03:14.774 --> 01:03:16.025
You'd go back on the board.

01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:19.612
It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.

01:03:19.904 --> 01:03:21.530
You'll be happier if you wait.

01:03:21.781 --> 01:03:25.660
Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

01:03:25.952 --> 01:03:27.495
It's the Friday before Christmas.

01:03:27.787 --> 01:03:28.996
It's still a workday.

01:03:29.497 --> 01:03:31.040
Nobody's gonna want to...

01:03:31.332 --> 01:03:32.959
Either you call them or I do.

01:03:33.251 --> 01:03:36.504
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

01:03:36.796 --> 01:03:38.965
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

01:03:41.342 --> 01:03:42.343
Yes, we are.

01:03:48.808 --> 01:03:52.144
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

01:03:53.229 --> 01:03:55.231
I did all of the copy on that one.

01:03:58.359 --> 01:04:01.279
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

01:04:01.487 --> 01:04:05.074
I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

01:04:06.534 --> 01:04:09.620
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

01:04:10.246 --> 01:04:11.873
I'd like to get back to you.

01:04:12.123 --> 01:04:15.668
Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?

01:04:16.294 --> 01:04:18.254
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

01:04:18.504 --> 01:04:20.464
Why don't you let me see him now?

01:04:21.173 --> 01:04:25.887
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.

01:04:26.137 --> 01:04:28.014
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

01:04:28.264 --> 01:04:30.933
I'd like to see him before he leaves.

01:04:32.059 --> 01:04:35.396
- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

01:04:38.566 --> 01:04:39.483
Wait here.

01:05:10.389 --> 01:05:12.016
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

01:05:12.266 --> 01:05:14.227
- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.

01:05:17.271 --> 01:05:21.984
You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?

01:05:22.276 --> 01:05:23.736
Yes, I understand.

01:05:23.986 --> 01:05:27.823
Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?

01:05:28.324 --> 01:05:29.367
I need the job.

01:05:30.243 --> 01:05:33.663
Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.

01:05:34.205 --> 01:05:35.665
This is a one-day offer.

01:05:35.873 --> 01:05:39.043
You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:43.381
You're gonna have to let me know today,
not at the end of the holidays.

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:46.342
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

01:05:53.307 --> 01:05:55.601
Could we talk privately for a moment?

01:05:55.893 --> 01:05:57.019
Yes, sir.

01:06:43.482 --> 01:06:48.029
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

01:06:48.321 --> 01:06:49.572
Really?

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.576
- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.

01:06:53.868 --> 01:06:56.621
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

01:07:15.306 --> 01:07:16.682
Merry Christmas.

01:07:30.112 --> 01:07:31.280
Come on.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.995
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

01:07:38.287 --> 01:07:40.581
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

01:07:40.873 --> 01:07:45.503
It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

01:07:45.962 --> 01:07:47.588
Okay, push " up. "

01:07:51.008 --> 01:07:53.219
Push the top button.
Very top button.

01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:54.845
Go ahead, jump.

01:07:58.516 --> 01:07:59.684
- Look at that!
- Neat!

01:07:59.934 --> 01:08:01.394
You didn't know you were so high.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:04.397
What building is that?
That has the pointy top.

01:08:04.647 --> 01:08:06.107
That's the Chrysler.

01:08:06.399 --> 01:08:08.192
You proud of me?

01:08:08.484 --> 01:08:09.694
How'd you get this job?

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:12.989
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

01:08:13.239 --> 01:08:14.240
It says " Kramer. "

01:08:14.532 --> 01:08:16.492
Kramer. Who's that?

01:08:16.742 --> 01:08:18.703
- That's us.
- That's right.

01:08:18.953 --> 01:08:20.328
You want to see?

01:08:22.081 --> 01:08:24.041
Wow!

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:28.045
- This is neat.
- You like it?

01:08:28.629 --> 01:08:29.796
Careful, careful.

01:08:30.089 --> 01:08:31.173
- I'm okay.
- Scare me.

01:08:31.465 --> 01:08:33.009
What's that building?

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:36.011
That's the U.N. building.
That's the East River.

01:08:36.261 --> 01:08:38.139
Look across there. You see that?

01:08:38.346 --> 01:08:41.017
That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.

01:08:41.267 --> 01:08:42.643
- Know what that is?
- What?

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:45.604
- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?

01:08:45.854 --> 01:08:48.691
That's right,
and this is where I work.

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:52.819
Is this really your desk?

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:57.825
Are you gonna get remarried?

01:08:58.075 --> 01:09:00.118
I hadn't thought about it.

01:09:00.661 --> 01:09:02.705
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

01:09:02.913 --> 01:09:04.957
No, we're just good friends.

01:09:08.752 --> 01:09:11.421
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.926
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

01:09:15.468 --> 01:09:18.720
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

01:09:20.932 --> 01:09:23.142
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

01:09:24.435 --> 01:09:26.479
You take a bath every night...

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.732
...and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?

01:09:30.233 --> 01:09:31.067
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:09:31.317 --> 01:09:32.484
Okay.

01:09:32.777 --> 01:09:34.153
Promise, or you're not going.

01:09:34.654 --> 01:09:37.323
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

01:09:37.573 --> 01:09:40.158
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

01:09:42.036 --> 01:09:45.206
Did I, Dad? Did I?

01:09:47.332 --> 01:09:48.542
Are you listening?

01:09:48.834 --> 01:09:51.671
We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

01:09:51.879 --> 01:09:53.506
Come here, give me a kiss.

01:09:54.549 --> 01:09:56.842
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

01:10:03.182 --> 01:10:05.059
He says, "There's the unicorn. "

01:10:05.309 --> 01:10:07.979
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:10.439
" Crumbs, what's happening?

01:10:10.690 --> 01:10:12.316
The air supply has stopped.

01:10:12.567 --> 01:10:15.111
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"

01:10:15.403 --> 01:10:17.697
" Resting. It's tiring work,
you know. "

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:19.407
What's the air supply?

01:10:19.699 --> 01:10:23.119
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air...

01:10:23.369 --> 01:10:25.538
...you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.

01:10:25.830 --> 01:10:27.039
Ted, John Shaunessy.

01:10:27.290 --> 01:10:28.291
Hi, what's up?

01:10:28.541 --> 01:10:32.753
I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.

01:10:33.129 --> 01:10:35.423
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

01:10:35.715 --> 01:10:37.758
She's within her legal rights.

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:42.263
- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother...

01:10:42.513 --> 01:10:44.724
...suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

01:10:45.558 --> 01:10:48.394
Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.

01:10:48.686 --> 01:10:51.939
- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.

01:10:52.148 --> 01:10:53.149
A psychiatrist.

01:10:53.441 --> 01:10:54.817
Did you see her talk to walls?

01:10:55.067 --> 01:10:56.611
I'm just saying, you know.

01:10:56.903 --> 01:10:59.196
I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.

01:10:59.488 --> 01:11:02.825
Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

01:11:03.117 --> 01:11:05.244
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

01:11:06.329 --> 01:11:07.788
Thanks very much.

01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.376
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

01:11:13.502 --> 01:11:15.671
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

01:11:19.467 --> 01:11:22.803
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:26.849
When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.

01:11:27.099 --> 01:11:28.309
Where did I leave off?

01:11:28.601 --> 01:11:31.103
You left off right there.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:32.980
"Thundering typhoons... "

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.818
It's got an obstacle course and stuff.

01:11:38.110 --> 01:11:40.321
- The cars go really fast.
- How much?

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:41.614
It's really neat.

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.241
It's neat.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.786
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

01:12:02.176 --> 01:12:04.470
I'll have him back by 6.

01:12:05.513 --> 01:12:06.806
You got so handsome.

01:13:03.321 --> 01:13:07.783
Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

01:13:08.034 --> 01:13:11.454
Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:16.584
- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

01:13:16.834 --> 01:13:20.630
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.

01:13:20.922 --> 01:13:24.467
You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:29.096
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

01:13:29.347 --> 01:13:32.683
...special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:37.688
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

01:13:54.705 --> 01:13:58.167
- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honour.

01:13:58.459 --> 01:14:00.545
I would like to call Joanna Kramer.

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.547
Motherhood, going for the throat.

01:14:02.838 --> 01:14:05.758
You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:07.301
I do.

01:14:13.599 --> 01:14:17.812
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

01:14:18.062 --> 01:14:19.188
Eight years.

01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:22.733
And would you describe those years
as happy?

01:14:23.150 --> 01:14:25.194
The first two, yes.

01:14:25.570 --> 01:14:28.990
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

01:14:29.949 --> 01:14:34.245
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:38.040
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

01:14:38.291 --> 01:14:43.296
...I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.

01:14:44.213 --> 01:14:47.800
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

01:14:48.009 --> 01:14:50.094
No. I did not.

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:51.762
Did you wish to?

01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:56.934
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

01:14:57.184 --> 01:15:01.981
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:06.777
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

01:15:07.153 --> 01:15:09.655
He said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:12.491
...that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

01:15:12.783 --> 01:15:15.703
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:18.456
I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.

01:15:18.748 --> 01:15:21.167
And what is your present salary?

01:15:21.459 --> 01:15:24.045
I make $31,000 a year.

01:15:24.503 --> 01:15:28.007
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:31.344
Yes, I do, very much.

01:15:31.677 --> 01:15:34.513
And yet you chose to leave him.

01:15:35.431 --> 01:15:36.807
Yes.

01:15:43.022 --> 01:15:46.609
During the last five years
of our marriage...

01:15:48.361 --> 01:15:50.863
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

01:15:51.572 --> 01:15:52.949
More and more troubled.

01:15:53.241 --> 01:15:57.203
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

01:15:57.495 --> 01:16:00.581
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

01:16:01.582 --> 01:16:03.709
...wasn't there for me.

01:16:04.335 --> 01:16:07.088
So we became more isolated
from one another...

01:16:07.338 --> 01:16:09.131
...more and more separate.

01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:12.426
He was very involved in his career.

01:16:13.594 --> 01:16:17.723
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

01:16:17.974 --> 01:16:21.394
...and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

01:16:22.645 --> 01:16:25.064
...I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

01:16:26.607 --> 01:16:29.277
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

01:16:29.527 --> 01:16:31.988
In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.

01:16:33.906 --> 01:16:38.703
At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me...

01:16:39.245 --> 01:16:42.081
...and that my son would be
better off without me.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:48.129
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:52.466
...after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.

01:16:55.261 --> 01:16:59.807
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

01:17:00.057 --> 01:17:03.227
...other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.

01:17:04.186 --> 01:17:08.107
I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.901
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

01:17:10.109 --> 01:17:11.235
Objection, Your Honour.

01:17:11.527 --> 01:17:15.031
The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.

01:17:15.323 --> 01:17:16.324
Overruled.

01:17:17.825 --> 01:17:21.454
Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?

01:17:23.331 --> 01:17:25.458
Because he's my child...

01:17:25.917 --> 01:17:28.211
...and because I love him.

01:17:29.795 --> 01:17:31.881
I know I left my son.

01:17:33.257 --> 01:17:36.093
I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.

01:17:39.597 --> 01:17:43.184
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

01:17:43.684 --> 01:17:45.895
But in order to leave him...

01:17:46.562 --> 01:17:49.815
...I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do...

01:17:51.776 --> 01:17:54.028
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.989
I was incapable of functioning
in that home.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:17:59.200
And I didn't know...

01:17:59.450 --> 01:18:01.702
...what the alternative was...

01:18:01.953 --> 01:18:05.206
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

01:18:05.456 --> 01:18:09.001
However, I have since
gotten some help...

01:18:09.335 --> 01:18:13.798
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

01:18:16.592 --> 01:18:19.262
I don't think I should be
punished for that.

01:18:20.930 --> 01:18:23.849
I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

01:18:24.308 --> 01:18:26.519
Billy's only 7 years old.

01:18:27.478 --> 01:18:29.021
He needs me.

01:18:29.981 --> 01:18:32.817
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

01:18:34.068 --> 01:18:36.737
...but I really believe
he needs me more.

01:18:38.656 --> 01:18:43.035
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

01:18:43.953 --> 01:18:47.999
...and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

01:18:52.378 --> 01:18:55.214
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

01:18:55.506 --> 01:18:59.552
...that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

01:18:59.802 --> 01:19:01.971
...than Mr. Kramer does.

01:19:05.391 --> 01:19:07.018
I'm his mother.

01:19:09.478 --> 01:19:11.188
I'm his mother.

01:19:16.569 --> 01:19:17.612
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

01:19:18.070 --> 01:19:20.114
I have no further questions.

01:19:22.241 --> 01:19:24.702
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

01:19:25.578 --> 01:19:30.124
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:37.381
In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?

01:19:38.591 --> 01:19:39.800
No.

01:19:40.051 --> 01:19:44.931
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

01:19:46.474 --> 01:19:49.560
Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?

01:19:50.978 --> 01:19:52.438
A heavy drinker?

01:19:53.397 --> 01:19:55.191
Was he unfaithful?

01:20:02.573 --> 01:20:05.576
Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:10.540
I can certainly see why you left him.

01:20:10.831 --> 01:20:12.291
Objection.

01:20:14.544 --> 01:20:17.463
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

01:20:17.922 --> 01:20:19.382
Permanently.

01:20:21.133 --> 01:20:24.053
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?

01:20:24.303 --> 01:20:26.472
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

01:20:26.764 --> 01:20:28.140
I'll allow it.

01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:33.312
I don't recall.

01:20:33.771 --> 01:20:36.232
More than three, less than 33,
permanently?

01:20:36.524 --> 01:20:37.775
- Objection.
- Overruled.

01:20:38.067 --> 01:20:40.194
The witness will answer, please.

01:20:42.363 --> 01:20:43.990
Somewhere in between.

01:20:44.282 --> 01:20:45.825
Do you have a lover now?

01:20:49.871 --> 01:20:53.583
Your Honour, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

01:20:53.875 --> 01:20:55.668
Does she have a lover?

01:20:55.918 --> 01:20:59.589
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

01:21:01.382 --> 01:21:03.593
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

01:21:03.843 --> 01:21:06.596
Is that... permanent?

01:21:08.472 --> 01:21:09.432
I don't know.

01:21:09.724 --> 01:21:12.226
We don't know
when you say permanently...

01:21:12.518 --> 01:21:16.731
...if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter...

01:21:17.023 --> 01:21:21.777
...since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.

01:21:22.028 --> 01:21:26.407
Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

01:21:26.657 --> 01:21:27.783
Sustained.

01:21:28.075 --> 01:21:30.453
I'll put it another way, counsellor.

01:21:31.078 --> 01:21:34.749
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

01:21:34.999 --> 01:21:37.543
...outside of parents or girlfriends?

01:21:40.046 --> 01:21:41.756
I suppose that would be my child.

01:21:42.423 --> 01:21:45.092
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

01:21:45.301 --> 01:21:49.013
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:52.975
...wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

01:21:56.562 --> 01:21:58.814
Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.

01:21:59.899 --> 01:22:01.108
Yes.

01:22:01.651 --> 01:22:03.194
How long was that?

01:22:04.779 --> 01:22:08.032
We were married a year
before the baby...

01:22:08.741 --> 01:22:10.201
...and seven years after.

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:14.247
So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:16.123
- Objection.
- Overruled.

01:22:16.374 --> 01:22:19.293
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

01:22:20.169 --> 01:22:21.963
I was not a failure.

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:26.092
What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

01:22:26.634 --> 01:22:29.053
I consider it less my failure
than his.

01:22:29.303 --> 01:22:30.763
Congratulations.

01:22:31.055 --> 01:22:34.850
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

01:22:35.142 --> 01:22:36.602
Objection!

01:22:37.478 --> 01:22:40.940
Your Honour, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

01:22:41.232 --> 01:22:43.484
...and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

01:22:44.110 --> 01:22:48.948
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:56.289
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

01:22:56.581 --> 01:23:01.127
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

01:23:01.377 --> 01:23:02.837
Were you?!

01:23:08.509 --> 01:23:09.719
No.

01:23:15.141 --> 01:23:16.934
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

01:23:24.442 --> 01:23:26.235
No further questions.

01:23:30.198 --> 01:23:33.201
- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?

01:23:33.492 --> 01:23:34.702
Daddy?

01:23:35.661 --> 01:23:36.871
Daddy.

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:40.166
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

01:23:40.416 --> 01:23:41.792
The same things you do.

01:23:42.126 --> 01:23:44.503
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

01:23:45.129 --> 01:23:47.632
No, we didn't have any television.

01:23:48.174 --> 01:23:49.717
You didn't?

01:23:50.009 --> 01:23:51.719
We listened to the radio.

01:23:51.969 --> 01:23:53.429
What else didn't you have?

01:23:53.888 --> 01:23:55.598
We didn't have lots of things.

01:23:55.848 --> 01:23:57.850
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

01:23:58.976 --> 01:23:59.977
What kind?

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:04.565
Come here.

01:24:05.733 --> 01:24:07.276
We didn't have diet soda.

01:24:07.568 --> 01:24:09.779
We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup...

01:24:10.029 --> 01:24:12.448
...seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went...

01:24:12.865 --> 01:24:15.701
...and you drank it
and it was delicious.

01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:18.371
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

01:24:18.621 --> 01:24:21.541
We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...

01:24:21.791 --> 01:24:23.751
Boy, those were the days.

01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:26.003
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

01:24:26.254 --> 01:24:29.840
...but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.

01:24:30.091 --> 01:24:32.468
We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.

01:24:32.760 --> 01:24:37.056
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get...

01:24:37.390 --> 01:24:40.810
...a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.

01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.980
We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...

01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:46.899
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

01:24:47.191 --> 01:24:49.944
He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.

01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:52.154
He reads to Billy a lot.

01:24:52.405 --> 01:24:56.033
They play together,
they talk all the time.

01:24:56.909 --> 01:24:58.619
He's a wonderful father.

01:24:58.828 --> 01:25:01.664
Thank you.
No further questions.

01:25:01.956 --> 01:25:05.042
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

01:25:05.459 --> 01:25:09.338
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

01:25:09.589 --> 01:25:13.134
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:17.889
I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but...

01:25:18.139 --> 01:25:21.309
...back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

01:25:21.601 --> 01:25:24.186
My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.

01:25:24.437 --> 01:25:28.566
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

01:25:28.816 --> 01:25:29.609
It was good.

01:25:30.318 --> 01:25:32.028
Joanna was a very good mother.

01:25:32.236 --> 01:25:34.280
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

01:25:34.530 --> 01:25:37.783
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?

01:25:38.492 --> 01:25:39.869
Yes.

01:25:40.119 --> 01:25:42.955
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

01:25:44.749 --> 01:25:46.959
Joanna wasn't happy for many reasons...

01:25:47.210 --> 01:25:51.756
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:58.179
Would you answer the question?

01:25:59.263 --> 01:26:01.766
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

01:26:02.099 --> 01:26:04.685
Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?

01:26:05.186 --> 01:26:06.479
No, I did not.

01:26:09.315 --> 01:26:12.818
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

01:26:13.069 --> 01:26:17.198
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

01:26:18.908 --> 01:26:21.744
- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

01:26:21.953 --> 01:26:25.289
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

01:26:26.624 --> 01:26:29.794
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.

01:26:31.170 --> 01:26:33.256
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

01:26:33.506 --> 01:26:36.092
Joanna, things are not the same now.

01:26:36.551 --> 01:26:37.927
Ted is not the same man.

01:26:38.219 --> 01:26:40.972
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

01:26:41.222 --> 01:26:43.015
They're beautiful together.

01:26:43.349 --> 01:26:45.142
The witness is asked to step down.

01:26:45.393 --> 01:26:47.270
If you could see them together...

01:26:47.478 --> 01:26:49.355
...maybe you wouldn't be here now.

01:26:49.605 --> 01:26:51.566
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:58.656
I'm sorry.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:02.493
When you were talking...

01:27:03.327 --> 01:27:08.040
When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:10.877
...most of what she said
was probably true.

01:27:11.127 --> 01:27:13.462
There's a lot I didn't understand.

01:27:14.171 --> 01:27:16.841
There's a lot
I'd do different if I could...

01:27:17.216 --> 01:27:20.303
...just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.

01:27:20.553 --> 01:27:23.890
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

01:27:25.057 --> 01:27:26.684
My wife...

01:27:27.018 --> 01:27:31.814
My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.

01:27:32.690 --> 01:27:35.151
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

01:27:36.235 --> 01:27:38.279
If I understand it correctly...

01:27:39.238 --> 01:27:42.909
...what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

01:27:43.451 --> 01:27:45.786
What's best for Billy.

01:27:46.913 --> 01:27:48.789
My wife used to say to me:

01:27:48.998 --> 01:27:52.251
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

01:27:52.793 --> 01:27:54.337
I think you're right.

01:27:54.670 --> 01:27:56.839
And maybe I've learned that much.

01:27:57.089 --> 01:27:59.467
By the same token, I'd like to know...

01:27:59.759 --> 01:28:04.680
...what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?

01:28:05.514 --> 01:28:08.684
I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

01:28:08.976 --> 01:28:11.812
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

01:28:12.063 --> 01:28:13.522
...listening to him...

01:28:13.814 --> 01:28:16.484
...or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.

01:28:16.776 --> 01:28:20.029
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

01:28:20.363 --> 01:28:24.200
I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

01:28:24.492 --> 01:28:27.745
...that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.

01:28:27.995 --> 01:28:31.249
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

01:28:31.541 --> 01:28:34.293
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

01:28:34.585 --> 01:28:39.549
Sometimes I don't have enough patience
and I forget that he's a little kid.

01:28:40.007 --> 01:28:41.384
But I'm there.

01:28:43.052 --> 01:28:47.181
We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

01:28:47.473 --> 01:28:51.769
At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...

01:28:53.062 --> 01:28:56.691
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

01:29:03.739 --> 01:29:05.700
If you destroy that...

01:29:07.285 --> 01:29:09.620
...it may be irreparable.

01:29:17.545 --> 01:29:20.464
Joanna, don't do that, please.

01:29:22.258 --> 01:29:25.511
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

01:29:25.761 --> 01:29:27.388
No further questions.

01:29:29.223 --> 01:29:31.559
How long have you
worked in advertising?

01:29:31.809 --> 01:29:34.020
Ever since I graduated high school.

01:29:35.396 --> 01:29:38.649
College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.

01:29:38.941 --> 01:29:42.904
Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?

01:29:43.154 --> 01:29:45.198
Yes, I have a good reputation.

01:29:45.489 --> 01:29:49.076
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?

01:29:49.327 --> 01:29:51.454
Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.

01:29:51.662 --> 01:29:54.332
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?

01:29:54.540 --> 01:29:56.500
- Yes.
- What is your salary?

01:29:57.084 --> 01:29:59.295
It's almost 29,000.

01:29:59.545 --> 01:30:01.923
Could you be more specific?

01:30:02.340 --> 01:30:04.550
I make $28,200.

01:30:04.967 --> 01:30:06.928
28,200.

01:30:07.595 --> 01:30:11.974
You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.

01:30:12.225 --> 01:30:16.771
Objection. Your Honour, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.

01:30:17.063 --> 01:30:17.980
Sustained.

01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:20.775
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

01:30:21.067 --> 01:30:25.696
- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?

01:30:26.155 --> 01:30:28.366
There was a difference
of opinion in policy.

01:30:28.699 --> 01:30:33.246
Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?

01:30:33.746 --> 01:30:34.580
Objection!

01:30:34.789 --> 01:30:37.542
I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

01:30:37.833 --> 01:30:40.127
He cannot hold a job.

01:30:40.419 --> 01:30:41.963
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

01:30:43.089 --> 01:30:46.259
It's not unusual in advertising
for a client...

01:30:46.509 --> 01:30:48.678
...to change his mind
and go elsewhere...

01:30:49.595 --> 01:30:53.182
Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation...

01:30:53.599 --> 01:30:56.602
...saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

01:30:56.894 --> 01:30:59.981
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

01:31:00.231 --> 01:31:02.900
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

01:31:03.192 --> 01:31:07.321
Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account...

01:31:07.530 --> 01:31:10.074
...causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment...

01:31:10.324 --> 01:31:12.285
...and considerable
financial liability?

01:31:12.535 --> 01:31:15.288
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

01:31:15.538 --> 01:31:18.082
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?

01:31:18.374 --> 01:31:20.418
- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.

01:31:20.751 --> 01:31:23.921
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.

01:31:24.881 --> 01:31:27.091
- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

01:31:27.341 --> 01:31:29.886
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!

01:31:30.511 --> 01:31:34.974
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

01:31:41.063 --> 01:31:42.690
I missed the deadline.

01:31:43.524 --> 01:31:46.360
- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.

01:31:46.611 --> 01:31:48.487
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

01:31:48.779 --> 01:31:51.782
- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.

01:31:52.074 --> 01:31:54.994
Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?

01:31:55.328 --> 01:31:56.871
- Objection.
- Overruled.

01:31:57.121 --> 01:31:58.581
Answer the question.

01:31:58.873 --> 01:32:01.083
He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...

01:32:01.375 --> 01:32:04.295
And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.

01:32:04.545 --> 01:32:05.838
He fell and cut himself.

01:32:06.088 --> 01:32:07.715
Is it true you told your ex-wife...

01:32:07.924 --> 01:32:11.552
...you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?

01:32:11.928 --> 01:32:13.095
Did you tell her:

01:32:13.596 --> 01:32:16.933
"When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

01:32:17.183 --> 01:32:20.186
- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.

01:32:56.055 --> 01:32:57.056
Ted?

01:32:58.683 --> 01:33:00.059
Ted?

01:33:05.106 --> 01:33:10.111
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

01:33:10.361 --> 01:33:13.447
...and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.

01:33:14.991 --> 01:33:16.367
Believe me.

01:33:17.243 --> 01:33:21.539
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

01:33:22.623 --> 01:33:23.833
I'm sorry.

01:33:24.292 --> 01:33:25.501
I'm...

01:33:37.054 --> 01:33:38.014
Ted.

01:33:38.347 --> 01:33:40.349
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.809
Heard anything yet?

01:33:42.059 --> 01:33:44.979
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

01:33:45.229 --> 01:33:46.856
- Guess what.
- What?

01:33:47.106 --> 01:33:49.650
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.

01:33:49.901 --> 01:33:52.570
Really?
Did he finally call you?

01:33:52.820 --> 01:33:54.363
No, I called him.

01:33:54.614 --> 01:33:55.740
How come?

01:33:56.032 --> 01:34:00.161
I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.

01:34:00.453 --> 01:34:01.412
And...

01:34:02.205 --> 01:34:04.957
I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

01:34:05.208 --> 01:34:08.461
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:12.215
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

01:34:22.516 --> 01:34:24.393
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:34:26.938 --> 01:34:28.147
I lost.

01:34:29.565 --> 01:34:31.817
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

01:34:40.785 --> 01:34:42.036
What happened?

01:34:43.412 --> 01:34:46.666
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:51.879
"Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

01:34:52.171 --> 01:34:54.423
...effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.679
...that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.

01:34:59.971 --> 01:35:02.473
The father shall have the
following visitation rights:

01:35:02.807 --> 01:35:06.477
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon...

01:35:06.769 --> 01:35:09.605
...and one half of the child's
vacation period. "

01:35:09.856 --> 01:35:12.066
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

01:35:12.316 --> 01:35:14.193
I can't guarantee anything.

01:35:14.402 --> 01:35:15.778
I'll take my chances.

01:35:16.028 --> 01:35:18.322
- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.

01:35:19.073 --> 01:35:21.659
Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.

01:35:23.035 --> 01:35:25.705
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

01:35:25.955 --> 01:35:28.040
I'll have to put him on the stand.

01:35:28.541 --> 01:35:30.251
I can't do that.

01:35:30.543 --> 01:35:32.503
No, I don't want to do that.

01:35:35.298 --> 01:35:38.050
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

01:35:54.442 --> 01:35:56.903
Ted? It's me.

01:36:02.241 --> 01:36:03.367
Ted?

01:36:03.951 --> 01:36:05.494
I just heard.

01:36:05.912 --> 01:36:07.538
Please go away.

01:36:08.706 --> 01:36:10.666
Are you okay?

01:36:12.251 --> 01:36:15.880
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

01:36:23.554 --> 01:36:24.597
I don't understand.

01:36:24.889 --> 01:36:27.808
The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.

01:36:28.059 --> 01:36:32.438
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

01:36:32.647 --> 01:36:36.025
...and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.

01:36:36.275 --> 01:36:39.904
We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

01:36:40.196 --> 01:36:42.448
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

01:36:42.698 --> 01:36:46.285
He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.

01:36:46.536 --> 01:36:49.956
I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

01:36:50.248 --> 01:36:53.251
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

01:36:54.794 --> 01:36:58.047
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

01:36:58.422 --> 01:37:02.468
Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

01:37:03.970 --> 01:37:06.430
- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.

01:37:06.681 --> 01:37:08.891
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

01:37:09.141 --> 01:37:12.228
If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.

01:37:13.354 --> 01:37:15.606
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

01:37:16.065 --> 01:37:17.608
Mommy will.

01:37:18.359 --> 01:37:20.778
You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

01:37:21.070 --> 01:37:23.322
No, I won't be able to do that.

01:37:23.573 --> 01:37:26.993
But, you know, I get to visit.

01:37:29.537 --> 01:37:32.081
It's gonna be okay. Really.

01:37:32.331 --> 01:37:34.750
If I don't like it, can I come home?

01:37:35.042 --> 01:37:36.586
What do you mean?

01:37:36.836 --> 01:37:39.005
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

01:37:39.255 --> 01:37:41.591
Really. She loves you so much.

01:37:42.133 --> 01:37:43.509
Dad?

01:37:44.552 --> 01:37:48.055
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

01:37:54.562 --> 01:37:56.439
We're gonna be okay.

01:38:01.277 --> 01:38:03.362
Let's go get some ice cream.

01:39:43.045 --> 01:39:45.882
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

01:39:47.967 --> 01:39:49.927
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

01:39:50.136 --> 01:39:51.929
Come on, set the table.

01:40:00.605 --> 01:40:01.731
Come on.

01:40:13.492 --> 01:40:14.869
Are you ready?

01:40:33.346 --> 01:40:34.180
Yes?

01:40:34.430 --> 01:40:36.974
It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

01:40:37.225 --> 01:40:39.685
Can you come down here
and meet me alone?

01:40:46.776 --> 01:40:47.735
Hi.

01:40:49.153 --> 01:40:50.321
What's up?

01:40:54.784 --> 01:40:56.994
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

01:40:57.745 --> 01:40:59.705
I woke up this morning.

01:41:03.668 --> 01:41:05.545
Kept thinking about Billy...

01:41:05.836 --> 01:41:08.756
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

01:41:09.006 --> 01:41:11.759
...with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

01:41:12.051 --> 01:41:16.764
...and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

01:41:18.474 --> 01:41:22.061
...then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

01:41:25.314 --> 01:41:28.484
I came here to take my son home.

01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:35.157
And I realized he already is home.

01:41:41.581 --> 01:41:43.916
I love him very much.

01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:51.632
I'm not gonna take him with me.

01:42:00.558 --> 01:42:03.477
Can I go up and talk to him?

01:42:03.769 --> 01:42:04.896
Yeah.

01:42:13.029 --> 01:42:16.449
Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

01:42:27.835 --> 01:42:29.378
How do I look?

01:42:31.547 --> 01:42:32.506
Terrific.
