Hey, my turn,
you bought last time.

01:23.649 --> 01:25.810
I'll buy the coffee,
you buy the dinner.

01:25.885 --> 01:26.909
Big spender.

01:26.986 --> 01:28.419
Only with my friends.

01:28.488 --> 01:30.683
Speaking of friends,
how were your days off?

01:30.756 --> 01:32.849
Except for one hour
fantastic.

01:32.925 --> 01:34.392
What do you mean
one hour?

01:34.460 --> 01:36.758
The subject of
marriage came up.

01:40.766 --> 01:42.597
You know, you ought to
get married.

01:42.668 --> 01:44.260
You don't know
what you're missing.

01:44.337 --> 01:47.067
Oh, I know what
I'd be missing. My freedom.

01:49.408 --> 01:50.602
What'd you do?

01:50.676 --> 01:53.042
I painted the back bedroom,
you know, for the boy?

01:53.112 --> 01:55.910
For the boy? The kid
hasn't been born yet.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.606
Boys run in my family.

01:57.884 --> 01:59.408
You're pretty sure
of yourself?

01:59.519 --> 02:00.451
Yeah.

02:00.520 --> 02:03.614
Would you like to put a little
money on it? Say $5?

02:03.689 --> 02:05.281
Why don't
we make it $15?

02:05.358 --> 02:06.620
Why $15?

02:06.759 --> 02:08.852
Because the doctor
charges $15 more for a boy

02:08.928 --> 02:10.360
than he does for a girl.

02:11.697 --> 02:13.665
(Miller)
Well, welcome back, troops.

02:14.767 --> 02:16.291
Hey, you guys were
working Adam-12

02:16.369 --> 02:18.462
while we were on days off.
How'd it go?

02:18.538 --> 02:21.166
Man, that burglar of yours
just about drove us nuts.

02:21.240 --> 02:23.538
That's what I wanted to
ask you about. Where'd he hit?

02:23.609 --> 02:26.737
800, Block Cypress.
905, 17th.

02:26.812 --> 02:27.801
And 1003.

02:28.014 --> 02:29.106
Three times, huh?

02:29.182 --> 02:30.740
Yeah, and the last one
went down

02:30.816 --> 02:33.580
while we were still taking
the report on the second one.

02:33.653 --> 02:34.677
Color TVs?

02:34.754 --> 02:35.743
(Russo)
Nothing else.

02:35.821 --> 02:36.788
The same M.O.?

02:36.856 --> 02:39.222
Pretty much. Pried the
louvers out of the window,

02:39.292 --> 02:43.353
used a blanket around the TV, hauled it to the back fence.
Car was parked in the alley.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.828
That's the same guy.
He's been driving us nuts too.

02:45.898 --> 02:48.025
Well, you can have
him back.

02:48.834 --> 02:51.928
Let's go. I wanna see the Watch
Commander before roll-call.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.568
<i>(female dispatcher)

03:00.379 --> 03:02.506
Can we talk to you
a minute, Lieutenant?

03:02.582 --> 03:03.549
Sure, Malloy.

03:03.616 --> 03:05.914
You know all those 459s that
have been hitting in our area?

03:05.985 --> 03:07.009
I've heard.

03:07.086 --> 03:09.145
How's about letting us stake
on area for a few hours?

03:09.222 --> 03:11.884
We can catch that guy if we
didn't have to chase radio calls.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.189
No, we're spread too thin. Just do
the best you can between calls.

03:15.261 --> 03:16.558
Yes, sir.

03:18.798 --> 03:21.892
If we don't get him soon, we
can stop worrying about him.

03:22.134 --> 03:23.123
[phone rings]

03:23.202 --> 03:25.033
He'll run out of
TVs to steal.

03:36.482 --> 03:39.007
The last burglary
was at number 1003.

03:39.085 --> 03:40.848
Second house
from the corner.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.182
Right.

03:43.055 --> 03:44.750
[police radio chattering]

03:46.092 --> 03:48.356
Just what I thought.
He's working his way west

03:48.427 --> 03:49.485
towards the freeway.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.551
His escape route?

03:50.630 --> 03:52.495
Right. Here's the way
I figure it,

03:52.565 --> 03:56.160
we work our way west, too. We check
every house with a color TV antenna,

03:56.235 --> 03:58.066
and we look for cars
with no backseats.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.468
Why no backseat?

03:59.538 --> 04:01.472
He's got to have someplace
to put the TVs.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.598
Yeah.

04:02.675 --> 04:04.802
We're going to cover
this neighborhood so close,

04:04.877 --> 04:06.845
people'll think there's
a unit on every block.

1-Adam-12, roger.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.863
You called
the police, ma'am?

04:29.935 --> 04:30.924
Yes, yes, I did.

04:31.003 --> 04:32.436
What's seems to be
the trouble?

04:32.505 --> 04:36.464
I think one or both of the little boys
that live in Apartment C is very sick.

04:36.542 --> 04:39.773
Heaven only knows where the mother is
and there's no father that I know of.

04:39.845 --> 04:41.005
Excuse me.

04:42.648 --> 04:44.309

04:46.252 --> 04:47.776
You hear anything?

04:47.853 --> 04:49.411
Yeah, somebody
groaning.

04:49.488 --> 04:51.183
Does the landlord live here?
No.

04:51.257 --> 04:53.725
Would anybody but the tenant
have a key to the apartment?

04:53.793 --> 04:55.124
Not that
I know of.

04:55.194 --> 04:56.991
Okay, we'll have to
kick it in.

05:17.116 --> 05:18.743
No sign of injury.

05:22.221 --> 05:23.518
(Reed)
Malloy.

05:26.992 --> 05:28.152
(Malloy)
Yeah, it figures.

05:28.227 --> 05:30.195
See if you can find
his brother.

05:30.262 --> 05:32.162
I'll check the kitchen.

05:33.466 --> 05:34.797
What's the matter
with him?

05:34.867 --> 05:36.801
Looks like he got into
his mother's stash.

05:36.869 --> 05:37.893
Stash?

05:37.970 --> 05:39.301
Narcotics.

05:39.605 --> 05:40.902
Oh, that's awful.

05:40.973 --> 05:44.431
That's terrible.
Well, that's criminal.

05:44.777 --> 05:46.677
Yes, ma'am,
it certainly is.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.572
She didn't pay her phone bill.
Can I use your phone, ma'am?

05:50.649 --> 05:52.617
I've got to get him
to a hospital right away.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.209
Yes, certainly.

06:29.855 --> 06:31.049
You call
an ambulance?

06:31.123 --> 06:32.181
Yeah.

06:32.258 --> 06:33.418
Are they in any danger?

06:33.492 --> 06:35.983
Depends on how many pills
they took and how long ago.

06:36.061 --> 06:37.824
(woman)
What's going on here?

06:40.132 --> 06:42.464
What are you doing
in my apartment?

06:44.403 --> 06:45.665
What's with
the kids?

06:45.738 --> 06:47.865
We thought maybe
you could tell us.

06:57.483 --> 07:00.577
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with him. He's just sleeping.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.482
He's done this before.

07:03.055 --> 07:05.649
It, uh, doc says
it ain't no big thing.

07:07.159 --> 07:08.558
What about
his brother?

07:08.627 --> 07:10.151
Yeah, him, too.

07:10.429 --> 07:12.192
The doc says
they'll outgrow it.

07:12.264 --> 07:14.789
Is that so?
Kinda like epilepsy, huh?

07:15.100 --> 07:17.625
Yeah. Yeah, that's what
he called it.

07:19.538 --> 07:22.200
There's nothing wrong with
'em, just a little epilepsy.

07:22.274 --> 07:24.333
No big thing to call
the police over.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.137
Not that I don't appreciate
it, you understand?

07:27.213 --> 07:28.840
Well, I'll take care
of them.

07:28.914 --> 07:31.041
You don't have to hang
around anymore.

You're under arrest.

07:43.162 --> 07:44.959
What for?
What did I do?

07:45.030 --> 07:48.796
For violation of 11-500,
11-910,11-915,11-555

07:48.868 --> 07:50.597

Possession of heroin,
possession of dangerous drugs,

and how much?

No, I'll see
if I can find out.

Mrs. Hallan, how many pills
and what kind did you have?

08:59.438 --> 09:01.497
Do you know how many
your kids might have taken?

09:01.574 --> 09:03.872
I never saw that stuff
before in my life.

out for you.

Okay. Let's go catch
our burglar!

09:38.444 --> 09:39.502
Should I clear us?

09:39.578 --> 09:41.739
Wait till we get back
into our area.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.789
Malloy?
Yeah.

09:53.859 --> 09:56.885
While we were at the station, I called
Central Receiving about the kids.

09:56.962 --> 09:57.951
What did they tell you?

09:58.030 --> 10:01.193
The doctor said it was close, but
it looks like they'll be okay.

10:01.266 --> 10:02.893
Boy, what about that
mother of theirs?

10:02.968 --> 10:04.833
That's something
I wanna talk to you about.

10:04.903 --> 10:06.165
The way you sounded
back there.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.728
Reed, you're a sworn
police officer,

10:07.806 --> 10:09.637
you've got a badge
and a gun to prove it.

10:09.742 --> 10:11.676
You're supposed to be
a professional.

10:11.744 --> 10:13.371
You didn't act like one.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.936
The situation and everything.
I guess it kinda got to me.

10:16.015 --> 10:17.812
You're not supposed
to let it get to you.

10:17.883 --> 10:20.613
You let yourself emotionally
involved, you can't do your job.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.154
That's part of learning
to be a pro.

10:23.222 --> 10:25.019
Maybe the toughest part.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.281
I guess you're right,
Malloy.

Jim.

are okay too.

your driver's license, please?

11:21.513 --> 11:22.639
Why are you
stopping me?

11:22.715 --> 11:23.909
You made
an illegal left turn

11:23.982 --> 11:26.678
causing another car to jam on
it's brakes to avoid hitting you.

11:26.752 --> 11:27.844
Oh, really?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.681
Your driver's
license, please.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.620
Gotta get that old quota,
don't you?

11:31.690 --> 11:34.887
No, lady, I've got better things
to do than to give you a ticket.

11:35.127 --> 11:38.426
Then why aren't you doing them instead
of harassing honest citizens?

11:38.497 --> 11:42.593
I asked you for your license. You committed
a traffic violation and I'm going to

11:42.668 --> 11:45.899
cite you for it. Now if you'll
cooperate we can get this over with.

11:46.338 --> 11:48.363
Is there anything else
you'd like me to do?

11:48.440 --> 11:50.806
Like take me out
of the car and search me?

11:52.511 --> 11:54.536
Take it out of
the wallet, please.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.842
You look like you enjoy
pushing people around.

11:59.918 --> 12:02.785
Is this your present address,
Miss Dickens, 1234, Hill Down?

12:02.855 --> 12:03.913
Yes.

12:03.989 --> 12:05.820
I'm going to fight you
in court, you know.

12:33.152 --> 12:35.245
from pushing around
tax-paying citizens.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.717
I'm citing you for violation
of Section 22-100B

12:38.791 --> 12:40.281
of the
California Vehicle Code.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.417
If you'll please sign at
the bottom, Miss Dickens.

12:42.494 --> 12:44.894
I'm not signing anything. I'm
going to take you to court.

12:44.963 --> 12:46.760
Yes, ma'am,
I understand that.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.426
But if you'll read on the
ticket it says at the bottom,

12:49.501 --> 12:53.767
"Without admitting guilt I promise to
appear at the time and place listed below."

12:53.839 --> 12:56.171
Now how are you going to
fight me in court

12:56.241 --> 12:57.538
if you won't agree
to be there?

12:57.609 --> 12:59.474
Oh, I'll be there all right.

12:59.645 --> 13:02.409
How are you gonna be there
if you won't sign the ticket?

13:03.115 --> 13:04.639
In that case,
I'll sign it.

13:16.328 --> 13:17.659
Thank you, ma'am.

13:19.364 --> 13:20.854
Okay, partner,
let's go.

13:28.507 --> 13:29.872
[engine starting]

13:34.446 --> 13:37.904
Why didn't you tell her if she didn't
sign the ticket she'd go to jail?

13:37.983 --> 13:40.144
'Cause she's the type that
would love to go to jail

13:40.219 --> 13:42.619
just so she could
holler "police brutality."

13:42.688 --> 13:45.248
Besides, I didn't want to
spend the time booking her,

13:45.324 --> 13:48.691
not with our friend out, scooping
up all the TV's in the world.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.662
Maybe he took
the day off.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.362
I doubt it.
He's probably a hype

13:58.437 --> 14:02.066
with a big habit and he can't afford
to take the day off without a fix.

14:09.581 --> 14:10.639
Malloy.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.448
Hey, there's a TV
in the back seat.

14:49.655 --> 14:50.986
Stop!
Police officers!

14:58.230 --> 15:00.095
[women screaming]

15:12.744 --> 15:14.268
He tossed something.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.285
Reed! Don't jump! There's a...

15:25.357 --> 15:26.619
[water splashing]

15:28.427 --> 15:29.951
...pool on
the other side.

15:48.814 --> 15:50.372
(Malloy)
"...and cannot afford one,

15:50.449 --> 15:52.007
"an attorney will be
appointed for you

15:52.084 --> 15:54.018
"without charge,
before questioning.

15:54.152 --> 15:56.746
You understand each of these
rights I have explained to you?"

15:56.822 --> 15:57.789
Yes, sir.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.915
Do you wish to give up the
right to remain silent?

16:00.025 --> 16:02.323
Sure. Besides,
what's there to talk about?

16:02.661 --> 16:04.060
That car
over there...

16:04.129 --> 16:05.790
Never saw it
before in my life.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.661
What about the TV
in the back seat?

16:08.100 --> 16:10.432
Oh, was there a TV
in the back seat?

16:10.769 --> 16:14.034
Gee, what won't they think of next?
A TV in the back seat.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.203
You wanna
play games, huh?

16:16.441 --> 16:19.376
Games, what games? I'm just
jogging down the street

16:19.444 --> 16:21.708
and two cops run after me
and tackle me.

16:21.847 --> 16:24.042
We ordered you to stop,
you ran from us.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.580
I didn't even know
you were behind me.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.680
That's the gospel truth.

16:29.087 --> 16:31.021
You're making
a very serious mistake.

16:31.423 --> 16:33.448
We are?
What's your name?

16:33.525 --> 16:35.049
Do you have any ID?

16:35.193 --> 16:36.558
Benny Johnson.

16:38.230 --> 16:40.391
But I seem to have
lost my wallet.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.735
Here's my partner. Maybe
he found it for you.

16:49.474 --> 16:51.999
Looks like he's been stealing
more than TVs. Any wallet?

16:52.077 --> 16:53.009
No.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.807
These keys fit the car?
No.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.007
Any place you might have
missed another set of keys?

16:57.082 --> 16:59.209
I don't think so. I went right
back over the same way.

16:59.284 --> 17:02.151
I looked around the pool to see if
there was anything on the bottom.

17:02.220 --> 17:03.482
You want me
to go back?

17:03.555 --> 17:07.116
No, we'll run the car for a want and DMV
and then take him back to the station.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.625
Get anything out of him?

17:08.693 --> 17:11.320
No, except a name
which is probably a phony.

17:13.397 --> 17:15.923
<i>(female dispatcher)
Standby.</i>

17:17.569 --> 17:18.762
Hello.

17:20.571 --> 17:23.006
1-Adam-12 requesting
a want and DMV

17:23.075 --> 17:25.406

17:26.744 --> 17:30.010
<i>(female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12,
Lincoln, X-Ray, Ida 483.</i>

17:31.483 --> 17:33.212
You kids
better get home now.

17:33.285 --> 17:36.345
What'd you bust him for?
Is he going to the slammer?

17:36.855 --> 17:39.289
Busted? Slammer?
What's that mean?

17:39.758 --> 17:41.783
Arrested.
Going to jail.

17:41.960 --> 17:43.791
Gee, you don't
know anything.

17:45.097 --> 17:46.325
Oh, I see.

17:46.832 --> 17:51.064
Well, mister, we busted him
for 21954 A.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.902
What's that mean?

17:53.138 --> 17:55.299
Obstructing traffic.

17:59.945 --> 18:01.071
Hey!

18:01.379 --> 18:02.505
Yeah?

18:02.814 --> 18:04.748
You kids come down
to the station sometime,

18:04.816 --> 18:07.080
maybe we'll give you
a tour of the slammer.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.649
Gee, thanks.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.781
<i>(female dispatcher) 1-Adam-12,

18:23.768 --> 18:25.497
1-Adam-12, roger.

18:25.704 --> 18:26.762
What's your name?

18:26.872 --> 18:28.669
I told you.
Benny Johnson.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.232
You're sure it's not
Leon Berlin?

18:31.576 --> 18:33.271
I ought to know
my own name.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.313
What do we do about
the car, impound it?

18:35.380 --> 18:38.008
Call the Sergeant, ask him to
get another unit to sit on it

18:38.083 --> 18:40.574
while we take Mr. Johnson
into the station.

18:40.785 --> 18:42.912
If we've got him,
it's not gonna go anyplace.

18:43.021 --> 18:45.489
How do we know we got the
"him" that's driving that car,

18:45.557 --> 18:46.990
maybe he's got
a partner.

18:47.058 --> 18:48.286
Guess so.

18:48.793 --> 18:52.251
1-Adam-12, requesting
Moon Lincoln 20 on Tac 2.

18:54.432 --> 18:57.196
(Malloy) If we can tie him to the
car, I think we got our TV thief.

18:57.269 --> 18:59.294
But did you actually
see him in the car?

18:59.371 --> 19:00.395
No, sir.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.633
And do you know for a fact
if that TV is stolen?

19:02.707 --> 19:03.935
No, sir.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.441
Do we have
a crime and a victim?

19:06.578 --> 19:09.206
Sergeant MacDonald said he'd knock
on doors in the neighborhood,

19:09.281 --> 19:10.908
see if anyone was
missing property.

19:10.982 --> 19:12.108
That'll help.

19:12.851 --> 19:16.150
It's obvious this suspect is up to
something, or he wouldn't have run.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.348
But the question is, what,
and can we book him for it?

19:18.423 --> 19:20.550
Let's run him on the Facsimile
Identification Network

19:20.625 --> 19:22.354
and see if he's got a record.

19:22.427 --> 19:23.689
Yes, sir.

19:26.164 --> 19:27.654
[phone ringing]

19:34.873 --> 19:36.670
You guys gonna
turn me loose, huh?

19:36.741 --> 19:39.209
Mr. Johnson, we're going to
find out if you got a record.

19:39.277 --> 19:42.508
Don't have to worry about that.
I'm clean, never been arrested.

19:42.581 --> 19:45.311
If you're so clean, why wouldn't
you tell us what you were doing

19:45.383 --> 19:47.578
and where you got the
stuff you threw on us?

19:48.920 --> 19:51.115
All right.
The tools are mine.

19:51.656 --> 19:54.056
They might have fallen out
as I was jogging.

19:54.125 --> 19:55.888
What about the watches
and jewelry?

19:55.961 --> 19:57.929
Oh, no. I never saw
that stuff before.

19:58.096 --> 20:00.326
Hi, Charlie.
We got a customer for you.

20:00.398 --> 20:01.865
My home
is your home.

20:01.967 --> 20:03.366
[buzzer sounding]

20:05.337 --> 20:07.430
Want you to run
Mr. Johnson on the FIN.

20:07.505 --> 20:08.904
Lock this up for us,
will you?

20:08.974 --> 20:10.271
Right.

20:11.610 --> 20:12.872
Thumb print
and name?

20:12.944 --> 20:14.377
You're making
a mistake, fellas.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.006
You're just wasting
the taxpayers time and money.

20:17.515 --> 20:18.846
10 fingers.

20:19.017 --> 20:20.075
Right.

20:20.185 --> 20:22.346
[typing]

20:22.520 --> 20:23.748
What's your
first name?

20:23.822 --> 20:26.290
Benny. Benjamin.

20:29.894 --> 20:31.020
Middle name?

20:31.096 --> 20:32.188
Foster.

20:42.340 --> 20:43.898
Relax your right hand.

20:58.056 --> 21:00.524
How's that thing work,
Charlie? Like a teletype?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.219
No, it's a photo process.

21:02.294 --> 21:05.457
Like the way they send newspaper
pictures across country.

21:05.530 --> 21:07.589
Except this is
a much sharper picture.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.826
He's right.

21:08.900 --> 21:10.731
Okay, Mr. Johnson,
let's go.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.069
[buzzer sounding]

21:15.173 --> 21:17.505
I don't know why you fellas
don't believe me.

21:18.476 --> 21:20.034
I'm telling you
the truth.

21:20.111 --> 21:22.579
There's a couple of reasons we
don't believe you, Mr. Johnson.

21:22.647 --> 21:24.740
The best one is
that address you gave us.

21:24.816 --> 21:26.147
It was the truth.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.879
You told us you lived
at 230, Bayview.

21:29.254 --> 21:31.950
There is no Bayview
in West Los Angeles.

21:32.857 --> 21:35.985
I didn't say Bayview
I said Banning.

21:36.061 --> 21:37.085
Oh, you did?

21:37.262 --> 21:39.389
Okay, wait inside
for us, please.

21:47.272 --> 21:48.466
Anything back yet?

21:48.540 --> 21:50.303
No. Hear anything
from Sergeant MacDonald?

21:50.375 --> 21:51.774
He's coming in.
He said you could

21:51.843 --> 21:54.038
forget about the car with
the TV in the backseat.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.740
The owner showed up. Just
taking the set to be repaired.

21:56.815 --> 21:57.839
Stopped to visit a friend.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.816
How'd MacDonald
decide he was clean?

21:59.884 --> 22:03.251
The owner of the vehicle is a police
officer in one of the beach towns.

22:04.422 --> 22:07.585
That sure puts the lid on it. If we
don't come up with something soon,

22:07.659 --> 22:10.628
we're gonna have to kick this guy loose.
We can't book him for running.

22:10.695 --> 22:12.492
He looked good for a while.

22:12.630 --> 22:13.722
[phone ringing]

22:14.466 --> 22:15.626
Moore.

22:16.401 --> 22:17.959
Okay, Charlie.
Thanks.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.429
Your suspect's name
is James Fenster.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.030
His rap sheet
is coming in now.

22:23.108 --> 22:25.804
That's somethin', anyway.
Thanks. C'mon partner.

22:26.578 --> 22:28.409
[police radio chattering]

22:31.516 --> 22:32.778
He's been a busy boy.

22:32.884 --> 22:34.283
Any TV sets?

22:34.719 --> 22:36.710
No. Jewelry,
watches, cash...

22:36.788 --> 22:37.720
Hey, Malloy?

22:37.789 --> 22:39.051
Yes, Sergeant.
Got that evidence?

22:39.124 --> 22:40.148
I'll bring it
right out.

22:41.259 --> 22:43.454
I went banging on doors
and found a lady

22:43.528 --> 22:46.190
who's missing an Elmira watch
with a diamond cover.

22:46.531 --> 22:47.725
It isn't missing
anymore.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.266
Any sign of forced entry?

22:49.334 --> 22:51.268
She said she missed it right
after the guy

22:51.336 --> 22:53.327
came from the gas company
to check the stove.

22:53.405 --> 22:54.895
Then asked to
use her bathroom.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.567
You mean some guy wearing
khakis and tools on his belt,

22:57.642 --> 22:59.542
claiming to be
from the gas company.

22:59.644 --> 23:00.838
You got a case?

23:00.945 --> 23:03.140
We got a case. Come on, partner,
let's go get him booked.

23:03.214 --> 23:04.738
Thanks, Sarge.

23:05.316 --> 23:06.305
Charlie.

23:19.697 --> 23:22.427
Pete, do I have to put in that
part about going into the pool?

23:22.500 --> 23:23.899
It happened,
didn't it?

23:24.235 --> 23:25.759
Yeah, but I feel
like a fool.

23:26.237 --> 23:27.966
Write it
like it happened.

23:28.306 --> 23:29.671
But don't feel too bad.

23:29.808 --> 23:32.242
How do you think I knew
that pool was there.

23:32.477 --> 23:33.808
What, you?

23:33.945 --> 23:37.540
About three years ago, I went to
that address on a loud party call.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.407
Oh, yeah,
what happened?

23:40.018 --> 23:42.111
I got pushed into that pool

23:42.187 --> 23:44.314
by the cutest little gal
you ever saw.

23:44.622 --> 23:46.817
(Miller) Hey, what happened
to you guys tonight?

23:46.891 --> 23:48.085
What do you mean?

23:48.159 --> 23:50.423
Oh, we had to handle a couple
of calls in your area.

23:50.495 --> 23:52.190
We were tied up
on an investigation.

23:52.297 --> 23:53.321
What happened?

23:53.398 --> 23:56.162
Oh. nothing much. Just two
more TVs went bye-bye.
