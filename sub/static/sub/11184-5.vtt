00:00.934 --> 00:03.710
If half the rumors are true, I don't
know how you manage to stay alive.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.750
I make certain there are no witnesses.

00:08.809 --> 00:10.345
What's going on here?

00:10.410 --> 00:13.152
Just a routine security check for
your benefit as well as ours.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.851
Why us?

00:14.982 --> 00:17.223
There are vultures in this world, Mr. Hawke.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.491
In my game, we play with empires.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.590
And we mind losing very much.

00:23.223 --> 00:24.964
Hawke. Mayday, mayday.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.834
Sidewinder, 3 o’clock!

00:26.994 --> 00:28.701
Cate! Pull up! Climb!

01:49.743 --> 01:51.950
ETA in 2 minutes, Dom.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.490
Come on, baby, you can do it,
just a little further.

02:09.630 --> 02:10.937
Damn, there goes the port engine again.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.477
She's been through hell.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.068
How about a little compassion?

02:14.134 --> 02:17.638
How about a little compression? The
number 2 engine keeps flaming out.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.911
She'll make it. Don't worry.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.480
We made it.

02:49.536 --> 02:53.575
That's it. First thing tomorrow,
we strip all armament and electric,

02:54.041 --> 02:57.511
repair that number 2 engine
and double-check all circuits.

03:02.749 --> 03:04.751
How about a wash and wax
job while you're at it?

03:04.818 --> 03:06.957
That's not a bad idea.

03:11.124 --> 03:13.968
So long, baby, we'll be back real soon.

03:36.116 --> 03:37.254
Okay.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.593
So, what you're trying to say is
that there's no special helicopter.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.292
Oh, yes, there is.

03:43.523 --> 03:44.831
There is?

03:45.392 --> 03:46.666
In your mind.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.298
Oh I see, in my mind.

03:49.362 --> 03:53.640
Well, at the time, you were about to
be abused by that Sheriff and his men.

03:54.101 --> 03:57.275
Hawke, do you see my purse?
Where's my makeup bag?

03:57.804 --> 03:59.715
Where are my earrings?

04:01.842 --> 04:06.154
Well, I came along and you
were so gratefully relieved.

04:07.914 --> 04:09.120
Thank you.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.526
Okay, now, let me just try
and get this straight.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.964
What you're trying to say
is that I just imagined

04:15.021 --> 04:18.366
that I saw you in the biggest,
blackest, most awesomely powered,

04:18.425 --> 04:22.635
rocket, chain-gun, missile-laden
helicopter in the whole wide world.

04:23.663 --> 04:24.835
You got it.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.708
You know what? It's a good
thing the cavalry didn't come.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.805
I'd be dreaming about horses.

04:30.070 --> 04:33.142
It's too bad that guy doesn't
like you how you are.

04:33.406 --> 04:35.408
That guy likes me any way I are.

04:38.078 --> 04:41.025
I thought you were gonna hang around
and give me a hand to clean up.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.990
Is that my job?

04:43.049 --> 04:44.892
How do you like that for a question?

04:44.951 --> 04:46.225
I love it.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.458
Yeah, you would.

04:47.521 --> 04:48.829
You don't have a job!

04:48.889 --> 04:51.836
I don't have enough work around here for jobs.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.735
You are a part-time contractor, okay?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.568
Okay.

04:58.632 --> 05:01.476
Listen, I wouldn't want to take any
work away from your regular employees.

05:01.535 --> 05:03.310
Let them do it.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.180
Miss Gregory, I'm here to see Mr. Santini.

05:11.244 --> 05:13.815
Right, Mr. Santini!

05:14.481 --> 05:16.358
Mr. Santini, there's a Miss…

05:16.416 --> 05:20.159
Gregory. This is Mr. Spandel, my assistant,
my staff. Do you have a moment?

05:20.220 --> 05:22.826
Sure, sure. Thanks, Cate.

05:22.889 --> 05:24.061
Sure.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.161
I'm sorry. My associate…

05:26.226 --> 05:27.899
Stringfellow Hawke.

05:30.363 --> 05:32.969
So, what can I do for you?

05:33.099 --> 05:34.942
We'd like to contract all of your services

05:35.001 --> 05:38.471
and all of your facilities for
the next 30 days, Mr. Santini.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.453
30 days?

05:44.511 --> 05:46.650
Yours as well, Mr. Hawke.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.851
We find everything here satisfactory.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.758
Well, that's a big order, ma'am.

05:50.817 --> 05:53.024
You see, we got choppers
and we got maintenance…

05:53.086 --> 05:54.724
We can afford it.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.259
So, what do you want us to do?

05:58.258 --> 06:00.795
Nothing special. Just do what you do.

06:01.061 --> 06:03.439
Fly our staff around when
we have the need for it.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.967
In the meantime, just go to your mailbox,
pick up your check and enjoy the money.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.573
What are these fellows doing?

06:10.637 --> 06:12.617
Just a cursory inspection.

06:16.943 --> 06:19.048
Who's gonna pay for all this?

06:19.112 --> 06:21.058
Carter Anderson III.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.752
It's that industrialist.

06:23.817 --> 06:26.423
Industrialist, philanthropist,
patron of the arts,

06:26.486 --> 06:29.399
advisor to the President
on military technology.

06:29.456 --> 06:31.060
Good old boy.

06:34.227 --> 06:36.264
So, when do you want this done?

06:36.429 --> 06:38.602
You'll have ample notification.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.138
Fellas?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.986
At least now I know why you never win at poker.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.030
Now, that's how to do business.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.088
I hope you were watching and learning.

07:02.155 --> 07:04.192
The way I played it. Cool!

07:05.525 --> 07:07.527
What a piece of cake.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.336
No maintenance, no repairs, nothing.

07:10.397 --> 07:13.037
All we have to do is wait for a telephone call

07:13.099 --> 07:15.807
from a guy who'll probably never call.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.782
Remember Howard Hughes with the Spruce Goose?

07:19.606 --> 07:21.108
It doesn't bother you at all?

07:21.174 --> 07:23.176
That she just walks here and
acts like she can buy us

07:23.243 --> 07:25.814
like a couple of hunks of meat in a freezer?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.353
Are you kidding?

07:27.414 --> 07:30.452
At these prices, I'll pop for the sweaters.

07:31.551 --> 07:33.258
No case.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.074
Look Susan, you made a commitment.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.873
You be there or there will be
no more jobs. You understand?

07:47.934 --> 07:49.811
Yeah, I got to go. Bye-bye.

07:56.776 --> 07:59.450
Are you still serious about buying me out?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.889
If the price is right.

08:02.649 --> 08:05.391
I'll make you an offer you can't refuse.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.491
What?

08:42.554 --> 08:44.728
Hawke, don't hang up.

08:44.791 --> 08:47.271
Caitlin, this is the 6th time.

08:47.627 --> 08:50.540
This is not the 6th time I'm
calling. It's only the 5th.

08:50.730 --> 08:53.040
Listen, I'm expecting calls.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.476
You're tying up the line.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.172
- Is Santini there?
- No.

08:56.236 --> 08:58.079
What, is he avoid’n me?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.877
You know he's not.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.145
Okay, I just wanna know

09:02.208 --> 09:04.950
why he can't hire me on this Anderson deal.

09:05.011 --> 09:06.820
I never said he couldn't hire you.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.121
Okay, okay. Well, the way I see it,

09:09.182 --> 09:12.186
if he gets this deal, he's
gonna need more pilots, right?

09:12.252 --> 09:13.424
Yeah, probably.

09:13.486 --> 09:16.763
Okay, well, put in a good word for me.

09:16.823 --> 09:20.794
You know, getting paid for no
work is like my favorite thing.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.265
Yeah, I'll cite your diligence and initiative.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.139
Don't pull my leg, Hawke.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.770
You're always teasing me and
you never tell me anything.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.974
Caitlin, hang up the phone.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.914
Wait a minute.

09:32.972 --> 09:34.610
Hawke, wait. One more thing.

09:34.674 --> 09:35.778
What?

09:35.842 --> 09:38.118
Well, I can't start until Monday.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.154
You know, I don't believe you.

09:43.249 --> 09:45.195
You're begging for a job.

09:45.251 --> 09:47.492
And you want your vacation up front.

09:47.554 --> 09:49.363
Look, we have the whole weekend planned.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.460
We're going sailing, a ball game, you know.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.765
Bye.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.033
Bye.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.498
Are you still alive?

10:59.292 --> 11:00.635
What is it?

11:01.728 --> 11:06.177
Robert, if you're gonna spend
another night in there, I am leaving.

11:06.733 --> 11:08.735
That's okay, I'll lock up.

11:18.444 --> 11:21.152
No kidding, what are you doing in there?

11:22.448 --> 11:23.825
Surprise.

11:24.250 --> 11:26.230
Would I disturb you?

11:27.053 --> 11:28.828
I'm a perfectionist.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.502
Come on, Robert, let me in.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.896
I'm almost done!

11:34.027 --> 11:35.062
You know,

11:35.695 --> 11:38.175
I know what you're doing in there.

11:38.264 --> 11:40.471
You're developing porn films.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.241
You can't fool me.

11:45.138 --> 11:48.415
You know what I'm gonna do, Robert?
I'm gonna call the police.

11:48.474 --> 11:50.385
That's what I'm gonna do.

11:58.618 --> 12:01.258
I gotcha!

12:19.539 --> 12:21.382
I'll see you later.

12:22.508 --> 12:24.317
Don't play games with me.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.691
Oh, baby.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.525
I'll be waiting.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.595
I'll be waiting.

13:09.856 --> 13:12.462
So when do you want this done?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.472
Look, you'll have ample notification.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.641
Who's gonna pay for all this?

13:19.699 --> 13:21.201
Carter Anderson III

13:24.537 --> 13:26.107
Carter Anderson III.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.843
Carter Anderson III.

13:38.084 --> 13:40.189
Yeah, it's a picnic.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.324
It's a great way to pocket some bread.

13:42.388 --> 13:44.959
And use the downtime to fix Airwolf.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.129
Now come on, stop being so stubborn.

13:52.899 --> 13:55.971
Damn. Number 2 engine stalls
every time I do a right bank.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.912
I'm trying for a re-light.

13:57.970 --> 13:59.244
Go.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.648
Why take it out on the lady?

14:07.714 --> 14:08.954
I'm not.

14:09.315 --> 14:10.589
Okay.

14:11.217 --> 14:13.720
So, you don't like the Anderson deal.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.594
I don't know, just somethin’
about it feels funny.

14:16.656 --> 14:17.930
Like what?

14:17.990 --> 14:21.096
I mean, they walk in right out of
the blue and they hire us, right?

14:21.160 --> 14:24.141
Nuts, bolts, light bulbs, everything.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.767
Why us?

14:26.332 --> 14:28.403
They got their own fleet.

14:28.835 --> 14:33.011
Look, billionaire industrialists
do things for their own reasons.

14:33.072 --> 14:34.574
The man can afford it.

14:34.640 --> 14:37.917
Hey, he wants me waiting?
I'll be waiting, man.

14:41.581 --> 14:44.425
Do I have to remind you that
all we've been doing lately

14:44.484 --> 14:46.794
is to get our tails shot up for free?

14:47.754 --> 14:49.961
I just don't like being bought.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.663
I didn't like the way that gal
Rosalind looked right through me.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.675
And they knew all she had
to do was up the price.

14:58.965 --> 15:01.468
Look, just try to get along with her, okay?

15:01.534 --> 15:03.810
She's the big man's right arm.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.876
She's very sharp.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.809
Besides, we can both use 30 days of R & R.

15:10.543 --> 15:12.318
So can this lady here.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.058
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.

15:20.119 --> 15:23.032
Number 2 engine's out again.
Let's take this thing down.

15:53.152 --> 15:54.825
Yeah, I can do it.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.930
I need them quickly.

15:56.989 --> 15:59.469
Of course, you know I got to do
it when the place is closed.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.399
I know.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.097
Got to work all night. It's gonna cost.

16:04.163 --> 16:05.699
I expect it to.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.668
The call I got said, "Treat him good."

16:09.235 --> 16:10.441
Did it?

16:11.637 --> 16:13.742
You must be one big banana.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.447
What's these tubes for? Some big deal?

16:17.844 --> 16:19.187
Personal.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.756
Personal?

16:26.085 --> 16:27.189
Sure.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.835
Right, did you get some quick
pictures of those file cabinets?

16:35.895 --> 16:37.272
Yeah, I got pictures.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.537
I'd take it over to the
back side if I was her.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.380
Everett, what's going on here?

16:43.436 --> 16:44.915
I don't know. They said it
would be all right with you.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.143
I wasn't sure what to do.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.243
What's going on?

16:49.308 --> 16:50.912
Just a routine security check.

16:51.143 --> 16:52.713
For your benefit as well as ours.

16:52.778 --> 16:55.554
Hey, hey, hold it here. Hold it.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.061
These are my personal business files.

16:58.117 --> 17:00.063
Congratulations, Mr. Santini.

17:00.119 --> 17:01.689
We've decided to hire you.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.633
Mr. Anderson's enemies are now your enemies.

17:04.957 --> 17:08.029
You close those files. Now!

17:08.961 --> 17:10.497
Close ‘em.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.674
We're partners, Mr. Santini.
We have no secrets.

17:14.733 --> 17:18.113
The negatives will be burned as
soon as the data has checked out.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.776
Hey, just like he said. Put ‘em away.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.946
Do it.

17:23.675 --> 17:25.656
I said, put the files away, now.

17:25.810 --> 17:27.586
In the interim, you and your employees

17:27.646 --> 17:30.253
are to have no contact with any outside sources.

17:30.583 --> 17:32.221
The hell you say.

17:32.852 --> 17:35.230
Get the boss lady on the phone right now.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.631
She's out.

17:41.027 --> 17:44.907
You can handle this. I'm gonna go
find out what's really going on.

17:46.999 --> 17:50.537
So while he's finding out,
you guys wait outside.

17:51.103 --> 17:52.411
Come on.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.148
So, you tell me, eh?

17:59.211 --> 18:02.317
There's a good chance that Santini's
gonna put you on full time?

18:02.381 --> 18:05.089
Oh, I think this new contract's
just about decided for him.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.160
What kind of a job is it?

18:07.286 --> 18:08.629
Oh, it's very hush-hush.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.429
See, we fly these heavyweight business people

18:10.489 --> 18:12.162
to 1st-class parties and meetin’s.

18:12.224 --> 18:13.635
I think there's a big one comin’ up.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.366
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.132
So, you're gonna get a regular check.

18:18.197 --> 18:19.437
Like clockwork.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.536
Brava! I'm happy for you.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.404
Thanks.

18:24.470 --> 18:28.043
So now, that means you're gonna
be able to pay your bill, no?

18:28.341 --> 18:29.445
Any day.

18:29.508 --> 18:32.512
By the way, you have any trouble
catching this boy of yours,

18:32.578 --> 18:35.855
I know all the tricks. You come talk to me.

18:54.266 --> 18:56.143
What is it, Mr. Hawke?

18:59.338 --> 19:01.443
I came here to tell you that we've decided

19:01.507 --> 19:04.784
not to accept your most generous offer.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.647
What happened, Tony?

19:07.947 --> 19:10.450
He was upset with our security check.

19:11.951 --> 19:14.261
When I hire on as a chauffeur

19:14.687 --> 19:18.066
and people start looking for bugs
and bombs, I get real nervous.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.126
That's standard procedure.

19:20.192 --> 19:23.002
Look, you either level with me

19:23.462 --> 19:24.873
or we're out.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.834
Let him in.

19:28.134 --> 19:29.977
I can handle this, sir.

19:30.069 --> 19:32.379
Let him in. I'll handle it.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.253
Follow me, please, Mr. Hawke.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.913
Do you like Van Gogh, Mr. Hawke?

20:10.676 --> 20:12.087
Very much.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.955
I also know a Cézanne from a Van Gogh.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.997
Is it your habit to invite people
into your home to test them?

20:21.187 --> 20:25.294
When I want to check out the quality
of my investigative reporter, yes.

20:25.357 --> 20:26.529
And?

20:26.592 --> 20:29.232
You also prefer fish to beef.

20:30.096 --> 20:31.734
I'm afraid it's my fault.

20:31.797 --> 20:33.435
I thought you'd be so delighted with our deal,

20:33.499 --> 20:34.944
you wouldn't mind the security check.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.377
You assume too much.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.743
That's the trouble with us zealots, Mr. Hawke.

20:40.806 --> 20:43.218
We sometimes forget that not
everyone shares our opinion

20:43.275 --> 20:46.552
that our lives are as valuable
as we think they are.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.182
Brussels, full priority.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.590
They're asking too much.

20:49.648 --> 20:52.322
They now know we want it. That's our fault.

20:52.384 --> 20:53.988
Pay their price.

20:55.955 --> 20:58.435
Who's trying to kill you, Mr. Anderson?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.702
Mr. Hawke, I know you play cards.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.367
I know that you don't mind losing.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.635
That's because you only
bet what you can afford.

21:07.900 --> 21:10.244
In my game, we play with empires.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.441
And we mind losing very much.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.213
So, you're telling me the stakes are very high.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.982
There are 3 states in this
country with 27 corporations

21:18.043 --> 21:20.489
that are closed down or closing down.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.817
50-odd thousand workers are unemployed,

21:22.882 --> 21:24.384
or about to be unemployed.

21:24.450 --> 21:27.795
I've invested several hundreds of
millions of dollars, Mr. Hawke.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.890
You see, I've got this idea.

21:30.022 --> 21:33.026
Rehabilitate the factories, or build new ones.

21:33.259 --> 21:36.866
Put Americans back to work on a
competitive basis internationally.

21:37.096 --> 21:40.373
And yes, you bet, make a
bundle, if I can, doing it.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.808
You see, that's the better
idea that built America.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.110
So, who would try to stop you?

21:46.172 --> 21:49.119
There are vultures in this world, Mr.
Hawke, in case you haven't noticed,

21:49.175 --> 21:51.348
making billions on these failures,

21:51.410 --> 21:52.912
feeding on those corpses.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.185
They tried to kill him 3 times.

21:55.247 --> 21:57.727
One day this month, at a private ceremony,

21:57.783 --> 22:02.163
I'll sign the final papers with
government, labor and local businessmen.

22:02.321 --> 22:05.302
Once that ceremony concludes, the deal is set.

22:05.457 --> 22:08.666
So, you want me to get you
there and back in one piece?

22:08.861 --> 22:10.238
Exactly.

22:10.396 --> 22:12.034
Are you with us?

22:12.765 --> 22:16.042
I'm very impressed by what
you have to say, Mr. Anderson.

22:16.702 --> 22:18.875
The big-business power play,

22:19.038 --> 22:21.177
unemployment, hungry families.

22:22.141 --> 22:25.247
A whole corner of the United
States going down the drain.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.915
All we need is color slides.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.856
I'm glad you understand.

22:28.948 --> 22:30.222
Oh, I do.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.589
I've also had you checked out.

22:34.086 --> 22:36.760
And you are everything they say you are.

22:38.457 --> 22:40.437
But what I have not heard

22:41.160 --> 22:42.161
is why us?

22:43.729 --> 22:45.231
Or why Airwolf?

22:49.768 --> 22:50.803
Airwolf?

22:51.837 --> 22:53.544
Or Archangel?

22:54.740 --> 22:57.949
Mr. Hawke, we both deal
with contacts in high places.

23:00.679 --> 23:02.556
Why wasn't this mentioned before?

23:03.115 --> 23:05.026
Sometimes, the less said, the better.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.791
I'm well covered on the ground.

23:06.852 --> 23:10.561
It's in the air that I'm most
vulnerable. That's why Airwolf.

23:10.923 --> 23:12.027
What do you say?

23:14.159 --> 23:16.298
You do it by my plan, my way.

23:17.162 --> 23:19.142
I'm the only one that knows.

23:19.798 --> 23:22.779
And I decide when, where and if

23:23.168 --> 23:25.580
any special equipment is to be used.

23:25.771 --> 23:27.444
That's ridiculous.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.755
You drive a hard bargain.

23:31.810 --> 23:33.847
I intend to stay alive.

23:37.016 --> 23:38.552
Welcome aboard.

23:46.225 --> 23:48.034
I'm glad we'll be working together.

23:49.161 --> 23:51.300
If there's anything you need, just let me know.

23:53.499 --> 23:55.001
I certainly will.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.996
That's it. All done.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.806
It's good work.

24:23.195 --> 24:26.665
You know, I took a big chance
sneaking in here after hours.

24:27.399 --> 24:29.174
My money thanks you.

24:29.501 --> 24:32.277
Yeah, well, it ain't thanking me that much.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.848
We agreed on a price.

24:35.374 --> 24:37.752
The job was bigger than I thought.

24:40.379 --> 24:41.653
Okay,

24:43.482 --> 24:44.825
what do you want?

24:44.883 --> 24:46.920
Consider my situation.

24:47.252 --> 24:48.731
You got my tubes.

24:48.787 --> 24:50.733
I mean, I've done 12 of them for you already.

24:50.789 --> 24:53.770
I say to myself, "What
are they for, plumbing?"

24:53.959 --> 24:55.996
I could be in big trouble.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.772
Look, we're 2 professionals. I heard about you.

24:59.832 --> 25:02.870
If half the rumors are true, I don't
know how you manage to stay alive.

25:03.836 --> 25:07.477
I make certain there are no
witnesses to my existence.

25:08.374 --> 25:11.116
That's pretty good. You'd have to
kill a hell of a lot of people.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.652
How much?

25:14.013 --> 25:15.185
Double.

26:01.260 --> 26:04.503
Come on, Dom, do me a favor.
Just give me a listen.

26:04.563 --> 26:06.941
String, this is very sensitive.

26:08.333 --> 26:10.745
I just wanna play devil's advocate.

26:11.103 --> 26:15.108
String, if I don't get this fuel control unit

26:15.374 --> 26:16.682
in sync,

26:17.042 --> 26:20.080
Airwolf will go into a stall
every time we make a turn

26:20.145 --> 26:22.921
and she'll just tear herself
apart. You know that.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.358
One minute.

26:25.717 --> 26:26.957
One minute.

26:27.319 --> 26:28.525
All right.

26:29.054 --> 26:31.898
Now, they say that they want us and Airwolf

26:31.957 --> 26:34.198
because they're afraid of being shot down.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.499
Well, it makes sense.

26:35.561 --> 26:37.632
But that's what they say.

26:39.231 --> 26:41.768
I've got an idea maybe they wanna steal her.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.708
Oh, you know what worrying is gonna do for you.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.875
Get you a lifetime full of bills.

26:47.039 --> 26:50.919
Besides, what would Carter Anderson
want with a machine like Airwolf?

26:51.009 --> 26:52.249
Copy it.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.888
Hey, there's lots of high-dollar
guys could afford the basic unit.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.292
I think you need glasses.

27:02.988 --> 27:06.902
I got glasses. I can't help if
they keep making things smaller.

27:06.992 --> 27:07.993
It's Cate.

27:09.495 --> 27:11.497
Hey! What's that?

27:11.563 --> 27:12.803
What's what?

27:12.865 --> 27:14.071
Well, that.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.544
Now, you see what it is.

27:15.601 --> 27:18.138
Well, that's why I'm asking. Where's it from?

27:21.807 --> 27:23.150
Hey Cate, what happened to the boating?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.915
Well, we went. It got clouded over.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.785
The guy or the sky?

27:27.045 --> 27:30.993
Yeah. Hey listen, I came back to
find out if I'm on full time, or…

27:31.049 --> 27:32.960
Is that a fuel control unit?

27:33.018 --> 27:34.053
Yes.

27:34.119 --> 27:35.462
Yes, it's a fuel control unit?

27:35.521 --> 27:37.501
Oh yes, you're on full time.

27:37.556 --> 27:38.899
- I am?
- Yeah.

27:38.957 --> 27:42.131
30 days. And we get paid for downtime.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.004
So, enjoy.

27:44.062 --> 27:45.541
Paid days off?

27:45.597 --> 27:47.406
Paid medical expenses and everything.

27:47.466 --> 27:49.070
Great. Gee, that's…

27:49.134 --> 27:50.909
- Hey! Welcome me aboard.
- Welcome.

27:50.969 --> 27:53.210
Thanks, Mr. Santini, Hawke.

27:54.072 --> 27:55.073
You know what?

27:55.140 --> 27:56.141
- What?
- Listen.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.585
Since you've got the time off,

27:57.709 --> 27:59.245
I think you ought to go out and celebrate.

27:59.311 --> 28:01.917
Hey, is that an electronic fuel control unit?

28:01.980 --> 28:03.584
What ship is it for?

28:03.649 --> 28:05.026
Bye-bye, Caitlin.

28:05.083 --> 28:06.960
Say goodbye, Cate.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.229
Goodbye, Cate.

28:16.428 --> 28:17.429
Hi.

28:18.130 --> 28:19.336
Hi.

28:33.178 --> 28:34.987
You know, I love you.

28:35.914 --> 28:37.120
A lot.

28:38.217 --> 28:39.423
Here.

28:40.953 --> 28:42.364
What's this?

28:42.955 --> 28:44.400
Open it, see.

28:59.871 --> 29:02.317
You treat your employees too well.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.483
Only the ones I love.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.294
You know, I've been giving this
question about selling out to you

29:12.351 --> 29:13.489
a lot of thought.

29:14.519 --> 29:16.499
And I have a better offer.

29:16.922 --> 29:18.731
The business and me

29:19.224 --> 29:20.965
at no cost to you.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.634
Anyone help you decide that?

29:26.798 --> 29:28.004
No one.

29:28.066 --> 29:30.307
I told you not to discuss me with anyone yet.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.645
Honey, I haven't told a soul.

29:32.704 --> 29:35.480
And if I was to say anything, they'd say

29:35.540 --> 29:38.612
that I was acting out my adolescence, you know?

29:42.547 --> 29:46.222
I mean, I have to tell my Mother,
of course, and my sister.

29:47.686 --> 29:49.256
Of course.

30:12.144 --> 30:14.920
We had the greatest day, In the
morning, we went swimming.

30:14.980 --> 30:17.017
And then in the afternoon,
we went to a baseball game.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.993
And at night we went dancing.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.621
What else can I say?

30:20.686 --> 30:23.166
So, what did you do for the rest of the day?

30:23.588 --> 30:26.296
It should be right over
that crest there at 11:00.

30:28.694 --> 30:31.470
Hawke? There was a fortune
teller at the bar last night

30:31.530 --> 30:34.272
and she said something very important
was gonna happen in my life.

30:35.267 --> 30:37.269
I think it already has.

30:37.969 --> 30:40.609
You're gonna be flying Carter Anderson III.

30:40.672 --> 30:41.810
I am?

30:42.107 --> 30:43.142
There it is.

30:49.881 --> 30:53.886
Yeah, Dom and I are gonna fly backup, escort.

30:54.252 --> 30:56.892
Wow, just like that, I fly him.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.060
Well, you're the one that's multi-engine rated.

30:59.124 --> 31:02.571
Well sure, but I mean, that's
a pretty heavy first at-bat.

31:02.627 --> 31:05.437
What, you just signed on and
you're complaining already?

31:05.497 --> 31:08.205
No, Mr. Santini, I'm thrilled. Honest, I am.

31:08.333 --> 31:10.438
We better play it kind of like a shell game.

31:10.502 --> 31:12.607
3 peas as diversion,

31:12.671 --> 31:14.548
and one for real, Anderson.

31:16.241 --> 31:18.084
You guys are worried, aren't you?

32:22.941 --> 32:24.614
Goodbye, Edna.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.380
Drinks on the line, ladies and gentlemen.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.716
I saw her. Let's get down to business.

33:34.880 --> 33:37.417
Listen, we'll have the 3 choppers.

33:37.883 --> 33:41.092
Myself, Dom, and Caitlin.

33:42.921 --> 33:45.629
She'll only know that she's gonna
pick up somebody from the airport.

33:49.594 --> 33:51.403
Thank you, Barbara.

33:51.696 --> 33:54.267
What do you think? You feel like dancin’?

33:54.699 --> 33:56.235
I haven't danced in years.

33:57.769 --> 33:59.271
Neither have I.

34:00.005 --> 34:01.780
All the more reason.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.945
Come on, let's go.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.880
Up you go.

34:28.567 --> 34:31.013
Check out Caitlin and her new boyfriend.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.879
Boyfriend? That's kind of
an old-fashioned term.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.255
It's kind of an old-fashioned place.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.754
I like the sound of it.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.817
Kind of like old shoes.

34:47.851 --> 34:50.059
Yeah well, so who's your boyfriend?

34:50.487 --> 34:52.024
I don't have one.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.762
What's the matter? Against corporate policy?

34:56.928 --> 34:58.908
You'd be surprised.

35:01.866 --> 35:04.710
When are you leaving?
I wanna know. I must know.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.340
I'm possessed with knowing about you.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.782
I take off Wednesday at 2:00.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.513
I'll be back by the end of the week.

35:10.575 --> 35:12.418
Think you can survive?

35:13.311 --> 35:14.585
Wednesday.

35:18.183 --> 35:19.856
Hurts already.

36:02.093 --> 36:04.903
We're all set, gentlemen. Let's go.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.617
Ready, String. All set.

37:57.342 --> 37:58.412
Let's go.

37:59.844 --> 38:01.619
Ready, Hawke.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.303
She's got to be right in front of us.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.572
Heading 290.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.139
Hawke, come in. Mayday, mayday.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.580
Caitlin.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.049
Come in, Caitlin.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.312
Hawke, he's here.

39:36.374 --> 39:39.150
It's a Corsair. I'm at
Angels 6 and he's pursuing.

39:39.210 --> 39:40.883
I got you. I hear you, Caitlin.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.516
Head for the deck and take evasive
action. I'm right behind you.

40:04.435 --> 40:06.039
You did it.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.744
Once is lucky. You hold on.

40:13.111 --> 40:15.216
He just missed her with a rocket, String.

40:15.280 --> 40:18.921
It's a Corsair, all right. Looks
like wing-mounted sidewinders.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.377
There he is.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.640
Cut him off this side!

40:37.702 --> 40:38.703
Cate, now!

40:53.818 --> 40:56.321
Not now, baby, or we're all sitt’n ducks.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.293
He's on us.

41:04.495 --> 41:05.496
Manual restart.

41:12.870 --> 41:15.817
He got one off at us. Dropping a sunburst.

41:19.110 --> 41:22.114
Hey, the sunburst got one. But he's got more.

41:28.219 --> 41:29.527
Compression stall.

41:29.587 --> 41:32.090
Gonna restart, brace for ignition.

41:36.661 --> 41:38.140
Sidewinder, 3 o’clock!

41:38.730 --> 41:40.073
don't have enough power.

41:40.999 --> 41:42.808
Climb for ignition! Climb for ignition!

42:08.292 --> 42:10.101
Pull up! Climb!

42:51.702 --> 42:53.238
He's coming back.

42:55.540 --> 42:56.541
Not now!

43:07.552 --> 43:08.792
Rocket coming.

43:08.853 --> 43:10.799
- Sunburst!
- Sunburst.

43:48.192 --> 43:49.603
It's empty.

43:50.094 --> 43:51.095
It was enough.

43:53.731 --> 43:55.472
I'll see you, Cate.

43:58.169 --> 44:00.274
It was a good show, fellas.

44:03.007 --> 44:04.350
Robert!?

45:07.371 --> 45:09.612
I couldn't do a thing with her.

45:09.941 --> 45:13.150
You told her she had the rest
of her life ahead of her?

45:13.211 --> 45:14.588
I told her.

45:23.454 --> 45:25.024
Did you tell her

45:25.957 --> 45:27.561
that he fooled us, too?

45:27.625 --> 45:29.696
Hey, let's face it.

45:30.127 --> 45:32.073
My batting average is lousy,

45:32.129 --> 45:34.234
even with women who are in a good mood.

46:02.393 --> 46:05.533
Don't bother hitting me with the
psychology. Your friend just tried.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.041
Hey, I just came here to play.

46:07.765 --> 46:09.438
I'm through, Hawke.

46:09.533 --> 46:12.480
I'm through with people, with life,
with work, with everything. That's it.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.148
I'm gonna get on a plane,

46:21.212 --> 46:23.783
and I'm gonna just keep on
going till the money runs out.

46:23.848 --> 46:25.259
Then I'm gonna walk.

46:26.017 --> 46:28.463
I'm never gonna stop long enough
to get involved with anybody.

46:45.603 --> 46:49.244
You think I'm running away.
That's what you really think.

47:00.451 --> 47:02.453
You came to my rescue again, didn't you?

47:03.387 --> 47:05.958
You know, we really like having you around.

47:06.023 --> 47:07.525
But it wasn't us.

47:09.126 --> 47:11.834
Now, wait a minute. You wait just a minute.

47:11.896 --> 47:15.366
Do you mean that you're gonna sit there
and tell me that I just imagined…

47:15.433 --> 47:17.242
Well, that I didn't see…

47:17.301 --> 47:20.874
That there's no big, black
helicopter? Now, can you do that?

47:21.572 --> 47:22.949
I think she's feeling better.

47:23.305 --> 47:29.511
