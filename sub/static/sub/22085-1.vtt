WEBVTT

00:12.041 --> 00:17.625
[commentator]  We have
a paid attendance tonight, 27,458.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.375
-[bat cracks]
-That is the second drive...

00:22.166 --> 00:23.791
[man]  All of life is "What if?"

00:25.916 --> 00:30.291
I don't know that any of us
can identify what that critical role is

00:30.375 --> 00:33.541
that we bring to the lives
that we share in common.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.625
[distant baseball commentary continues]

00:43.125 --> 00:46.208
[woman] Right, in the case of
People versus Juan Ignacio Catalan...

00:46.291 --> 00:47.500
Is that your true name?

00:47.583 --> 00:48.500
Yes, ma'am.

00:49.875 --> 00:51.416
[Juan]  Um, let's see...

00:52.625 --> 00:56.125
Well, I was born in Los Angeles, in 1978.

00:59.708 --> 01:03.875
My dad bought a house in a suburb,
about 15, 20 miles north of L.A.

01:05.333 --> 01:09.833
My brother, Mario, started hanging around
with the wrong crowd.

01:11.041 --> 01:14.000
I always looked up to him,
'cause he was my big brother.

01:14.500 --> 01:16.708
And I just remember
seeing him coming home

01:16.791 --> 01:20.541
with stereos
and all types of different car parts.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.791
And that, I guess, intrigued me.

01:25.250 --> 01:28.250
They used to break into the cars
and I would be the driver.

01:30.125 --> 01:32.333
That was the first time
I ever got arrested.

01:34.333 --> 01:39.500
I definitely wanted to make that trip
my last trip ever to jail.

01:41.458 --> 01:44.125
[commentator]  The second run
that he’s allowed to...

01:53.666 --> 01:58.250
[Juan]  Well, it was August 12th of 2003.

02:00.208 --> 02:04.916
Me and Alma, we had broken up.
We were having some problems.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.375
I called her up and I asked if she could
come and sleep over at my house.

02:09.458 --> 02:10.958
It was maybe midnight,

02:11.583 --> 02:15.750
and he asked me, "What are you doing?"
I said, "Trying to go to sleep."

02:15.833 --> 02:22.458
She didn't want to, but... you know,
I'm a very persistent guy.

02:25.500 --> 02:27.708
That night, I had a weird dream.

02:28.958 --> 02:32.250
I had a dream of UFOs
or aliens or something.

02:32.916 --> 02:35.916
And that I was being taken away.

02:36.625 --> 02:37.500
I kid you not.

02:41.458 --> 02:43.791
Woke up, any other day,

02:45.250 --> 02:47.375
and we're driving to work,

02:47.458 --> 02:50.083
that's probably about 7:30 in the morning.

02:50.958 --> 02:53.291
We pull into our shop parking lot,

02:54.041 --> 02:58.250
and my dad was there, of course.
He was always the first one there.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.666
Five, six in the morning.

03:00.916 --> 03:03.250
[Alma]  We pulled into the parking lot.

03:03.958 --> 03:08.500
I notice a truck, kind of close to us.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.958
And that's when it all happened.

03:15.791 --> 03:17.666
[Juan]  As soon as I open the door,

03:18.125 --> 03:20.375
he jumps out of the car,
and he's just like...

03:24.583 --> 03:26.250
The only thought I had was I was dead.

03:29.041 --> 03:31.916
I was completely surrounded
within 30 seconds.

03:32.916 --> 03:35.958
They walked up to me,
threw me on the floor,

03:36.041 --> 03:38.125
face down on the asphalt.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.000
My dad opens the door,
and I remember, he poked his head out,

03:42.083 --> 03:43.291
out the door.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.250
And I just remember looking at my dad,
and he's like...

03:47.750 --> 03:49.708
He looked at me, and I go, "Dad, look..."

03:49.875 --> 03:51.125
I go, "Dad, look..."

03:52.541 --> 03:54.083
[voice breaking] I said, "Dad..."

03:58.416 --> 04:02.083
[on tape]  I'm Detective Rodriguez,
partner to Detective Pinner, okay?

04:02.541 --> 04:05.083
[Juan]  Hey, what's going on?
That's all I want to know.

04:05.791 --> 04:08.333
[Pinner]  We're hoping that
you're going to talk to us.

04:08.416 --> 04:10.625
Are you willing to talk to us
about what's going on?

04:10.708 --> 04:12.125
[Juan]  What's going on?

04:12.625 --> 04:15.250
Next, one of the detectives
showed up to the house.

04:16.083 --> 04:18.375
[interviewer] State your full name
for the record, sir.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.625
It's Juan Rodriguez.

04:20.208 --> 04:22.125
He says, "Well..."

04:22.750 --> 04:24.625
[inhales deeply]

04:24.708 --> 04:27.208
[voice breaking]
He's like, "He was arrested."

04:27.291 --> 04:29.708
And I said, "I get that.
Why was he arrested?"

04:30.375 --> 04:33.541
And he's like,
"Because the murder of Martha Puebla."

04:33.625 --> 04:35.000
And I said, "Excuse me?"

04:36.041 --> 04:39.083
And I think that I was speechless
for like five minutes.

04:41.375 --> 04:42.708
[narrator]  Juan was in jail,

04:42.791 --> 04:47.583
charged with the May 12, 2003
murder of 16-year-old Martha Puebla.

04:47.666 --> 04:50.583
The young woman had testified
in a separate case

04:50.666 --> 04:53.416
in which Juan's brother
was a co-defendant.

04:53.958 --> 04:55.833
[Juan]  Everyone makes mistakes.

04:55.916 --> 04:59.625
Just some people make bigger mistakes
than others.

05:00.125 --> 05:02.166
And they're not easily undone.

05:04.250 --> 05:06.375
My brother had been arrested
for a murder.

05:07.833 --> 05:10.416
And we went to his preliminary hearing.

05:11.125 --> 05:16.625
When we were in court, they did ask us
to provide our driver's license or IDs.

05:17.333 --> 05:22.750
One thing I remember very clearly
is Martha Puebla was a witness.

05:24.041 --> 05:27.000
[Juan]  They wanted her
to point out the shooter in court.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.583
But she never said anything.
She goes, "I didn't see anything."

05:32.458 --> 05:34.625
And I never thought anything of it.

05:34.708 --> 05:35.625
I...

05:36.208 --> 05:39.250
took it as we were watching
someone testify.

05:40.541 --> 05:41.750
[woman]  Do you solemnly state

05:41.833 --> 05:43.750
the evidence you shall present
in this matter

05:43.833 --> 05:46.166
shall be the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

05:46.250 --> 05:47.125
so help you God?

05:47.208 --> 05:48.166
I do.

05:49.041 --> 05:50.583
[Juan on tape]
You are going to take away my life

05:50.666 --> 05:52.750
for this fucking bullshit?

05:52.833 --> 05:55.291
[Pinner]  The bullshit is this.
You killed somebody.

05:55.375 --> 05:58.166
[Juan]  Wait a minute.
Those are very strong words right there.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.958
I did not kill nobody,
I would never kill nobody.

06:01.041 --> 06:03.416
I'd never do anything to hurt anybody.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.291
[Pinner]  Convince us otherwise.

06:12.625 --> 06:14.708
[Juan]  I remembered my cousin.

06:15.208 --> 06:18.375
He would always brag
about this kick-ass lawyer

06:18.916 --> 06:22.083
that he was a filing clerk for.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.041
Las Vegas.
It's a great place to go and have fun!

06:26.125 --> 06:27.375
We went there to uncover

06:27.458 --> 06:29.791
some of the sneaks,
cheaters, and sore losers,

06:29.875 --> 06:31.375
and they were all caught on tape.

06:32.166 --> 06:35.166
When I first met Juan,
I was in a criminal defense practice,

06:35.250 --> 06:38.916
as I had been for probably ten years.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.625
Naturally, I asked him
about the facts of the case.

06:42.375 --> 06:44.250
I got this story...

06:44.333 --> 06:45.250
[chuckles]

06:45.333 --> 06:46.583
that I wasn't expecting.

06:47.791 --> 06:50.875
[attorney] Detective Pinner,
what time did the 911 call go out

06:50.958 --> 06:53.916
with respect to this murder on May 12th?

06:54.875 --> 06:58.041
22:43, that's 10:43 p.m.

06:58.708 --> 07:02.541
I didn't know what the evidence was,
how many witnesses they claimed they had.

07:02.625 --> 07:03.625
I didn't know anything.

07:04.500 --> 07:08.083
[attorney] At the time that
the defendant was arrested,

07:08.166 --> 07:11.458
-did he have any facial hair?
-Yes.

07:11.541 --> 07:13.375
And what did the facial hair look like?

07:13.458 --> 07:19.000
He had a mustache and a...
He was slightly unshaven,

07:19.083 --> 07:22.041
with a small piece of hair
below his bottom lip.

07:23.333 --> 07:26.333
[Juan]  They showed me the sketch
and said that was me.

07:26.916 --> 07:29.166
[Pinner]  Male Hispanic,
black hair, very short,

07:29.250 --> 07:31.041
5'7" to 5'11",

07:31.125 --> 07:32.875
19 to 25 years old.

07:32.958 --> 07:35.583
Stocky build, medium mustache...

07:35.666 --> 07:38.416
[Juan]  Hair below his lip?
I've never had nothing under my lip.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.000
- [Pinner]  What's there right now?
- [Juan]  I haven't shaved!

07:41.083 --> 07:43.333
[Pinner]  Okay, so you didn't shave
this day either.

07:43.416 --> 07:45.250
[Juan]  Why wouldn't I shave
my mustache then?

07:46.041 --> 07:48.333
[Pinner]  I don't know.
'Cause you think you're cool.

07:48.416 --> 07:50.708
Because you think
there were no witnesses.

07:50.791 --> 07:52.291
But there were witnesses.

07:52.375 --> 07:54.708
[Todd] I asked him,
"Was the death penalty mentioned?"

07:54.791 --> 07:56.375
Yes, death penalty was mentioned.

07:57.583 --> 08:01.333
[Juan]  They had a paper
with my picture on it,

08:01.416 --> 08:03.166
and they're like, "Yeah, this is him."

08:03.250 --> 08:05.375
That's all they would say: "This is him."

08:06.000 --> 08:08.416
[Juan]  Please, you guys
can't do this to me, dude.

08:08.500 --> 08:11.541
I swear to God, man, on my two daughters
that I love so much, man,

08:11.625 --> 08:13.000
I did not do this.

08:13.500 --> 08:16.208
[Pinner]  People identified you.
The composite is you.

08:16.791 --> 08:18.583
[Rodriguez]  You see,
the pictures don't lie.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.625
[Todd]  I mean, I just had a gut feeling,

08:21.708 --> 08:24.958
there's just no way this kid
could have committed a murder.

08:25.041 --> 08:29.041
I mean, it just seemed
completely out of his character.

08:30.041 --> 08:33.708
And so I told him,
"I'm gonna get you outta here."

08:39.291 --> 08:43.125
[interviewer] Well, did you investigate
Juan Catalan in any way, shape, or form

08:43.208 --> 08:46.333
before you had him arrested
on August 12th?

08:47.375 --> 08:49.250
-Yes.
-[interviewer] What did you do?

08:50.250 --> 08:54.166
[Todd]  I wanted the chronological log
that the detectives are supposed to follow

08:54.250 --> 08:56.208
every time they do something on the case.

08:56.291 --> 08:58.416
We showed his picture to the witness.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.708
[interviewer] And?

09:00.250 --> 09:02.708
[Pinner]  We verified that he had
an apparent motive.

09:04.208 --> 09:07.916
Then I started to ask him, "All right,
do you remember where you were?"

09:08.000 --> 09:11.041
♪ And the home ♪

09:11.125 --> 09:17.875
♪ Of the brave ♪

09:18.083 --> 09:20.375
[Alma]  May 12th, I said,
"That's around Mother's Day."

09:20.833 --> 09:24.000
I'm like, "You know what?
Juan, you were at a Dodger game."

09:24.083 --> 09:27.083
He had bought some tickets for his mom
to go to the Dodger game,

09:27.166 --> 09:28.958
knowing full well
she probably wouldn't go.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.500
[chuckles] Yeah, I did.

09:30.583 --> 09:31.916
I got those tickets, you know,

09:32.000 --> 09:34.291
trying to pull them off
as a Mother's Day gift.

09:34.375 --> 09:35.625
[crowd shouting]

09:36.000 --> 09:37.708
[Todd]  If we can prove
you were at the game,

09:37.791 --> 09:39.458
get the case thrown out, easy!

09:41.750 --> 09:42.708
Uh... not so easy.

09:42.791 --> 09:47.708
[crowd singing
"Take Me Out to the Ball Game"]

09:47.791 --> 09:50.125
First of all, I wasn't supposed to be
at that game.

09:50.916 --> 09:52.875
[announcer]  We are pleased to welcome

09:52.958 --> 09:56.958
more than 2,000 City of El Segundo
employees, families and friends

09:57.041 --> 09:58.166
to tonight's game.

09:59.250 --> 10:02.375
I didn't know who to take
because it was such short notice,

10:02.458 --> 10:05.125
so I thought of my daughter, of course.

10:05.208 --> 10:06.666
You know, she was six.

10:06.750 --> 10:08.333
And she doesn't get into the games,

10:08.416 --> 10:10.833
but just her being there,
she gets excited.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.458
I took my cousin Miguel,
who's also a sports fan,

10:14.541 --> 10:16.500
and a good friend of mine, Ruben.

10:17.333 --> 10:20.666
Didn't think much of it,
just another Dodger game.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.666
[Todd]  According to the eyewitnesses
and the police reports,

10:24.750 --> 10:27.250
Martha Puebla was at her residence.

10:27.333 --> 10:31.583
She had come outside to talk
to a couple of other young adults,

10:31.666 --> 10:33.208
right around ten o'clock at night.

10:33.416 --> 10:39.166
[commentator]  We have a paid
attendance tonight, 27,458.

10:40.583 --> 10:42.375
[Juan]  They were going back and forth...

10:43.583 --> 10:45.541
[crowd cheering]

10:46.125 --> 10:48.875
[Todd]  During the time
that these four or five people

10:48.958 --> 10:51.458
were just outside of Martha's house,

10:51.541 --> 10:56.166
they saw a Chevy Malibu drive slowly
around the block several times.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.750
[Juan]  It was a tie,
going into the ninth inning,

10:59.833 --> 11:01.625
and I'm like, "We're not going nowhere."

11:02.208 --> 11:06.875
[commentator]  Éric Gagné comes in
and he would go into Mike Kinkade's spot.

11:06.958 --> 11:07.791
[crowd screaming]

11:07.875 --> 11:11.375
The person driving the car
came out the car and came up to Martha.

11:12.250 --> 11:13.625
[commentator]  That's a strike.

11:13.875 --> 11:16.166
[Juan]  He came in,
and I was like, "We got this.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.416
You know,
he's going to nail this ninth inning,

11:18.500 --> 11:21.125
we're gonna come up
and hit the game-winning hit."

11:21.208 --> 11:26.666
[commentator]  Marcus Giles, with runners
in scoring position, is hitting  .355 .

11:26.750 --> 11:30.083
[Todd]  Martha says,
"Hey, it's Martha, you remember me."

11:30.166 --> 11:32.708
And the shooter says something
to the effect of, "No, you don't."

11:32.791 --> 11:36.125
Pulls a gun out of his sweatshirt,
and then shoots Martha in the head.

11:36.208 --> 11:39.000
[commentator]  Ground ball up the middle!
Cora can't block it!

11:39.083 --> 11:43.125
And the runner's gonna come in.
Furcal scores,

11:43.208 --> 11:48.375
Giles scores, and the game
has come apart on Éric Gagné.

11:48.458 --> 11:51.250
[Juan]  Oh man, they rocked them
for like seven runs.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.708
A 4-4 tie became an 11-4 game,

11:54.791 --> 11:58.291
and I'm like, "Oh, dude."
It's over, let's get out of here.

11:58.375 --> 12:00.875
[Todd]  Having just witnessed
an execution-style murder,

12:00.958 --> 12:04.875
the main and only eyewitness in this case
dropped his cell phone

12:04.958 --> 12:06.791
and ran as fast as he could.

12:06.875 --> 12:09.750
[Juan]  I grabbed my daughter's hand
and we're walking towards the exit

12:09.833 --> 12:13.916
and I see a stand of baseball cards,
so I had to stop, I had to stop.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.833
[Todd]  Police talked
to the owner of the cell phone.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.375
He looks at tons and tons of photos

12:19.958 --> 12:23.291
and eventually gives a sketch
of what he thinks the person looks like

12:23.375 --> 12:24.500
that killed Martha.

12:25.041 --> 12:27.083
[Juan]  We opened up the packs,
and that was it.

12:27.666 --> 12:29.750
That was the night, nothing else.

12:33.416 --> 12:36.458
[attorney]  First of all, we had
an eyewitness who identified him,

12:36.958 --> 12:42.333
and cooperated with a composite artist
within days of the homicide,

12:42.416 --> 12:44.250
and came up with a composite

12:44.333 --> 12:48.416
that was strikingly similar
to the defendant in appearance.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.666
The prosecutor they assigned to the case

12:50.750 --> 12:54.333
had never lost a murder case
ever before in her career.

12:54.833 --> 12:56.875
She was murdered
because she did testify,

12:56.958 --> 13:01.541
and the day that she testified,
which was May 1st of 2003,

13:02.333 --> 13:06.583
Juan Catalan was present in the audience
during his brother's preliminary hearing

13:06.666 --> 13:08.083
when this girl testified.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.958
[Todd]  Her nickname was Sniper,

13:10.041 --> 13:13.500
because she likes to pick off people
with the death penalty.

13:14.083 --> 13:19.583
[interviewer] Do you think Juan Catalan
has any kind of a legitimate alibi at all?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.083
No.

13:25.000 --> 13:29.000
I asked Alma to find the tickets,
but not to touch them.

13:29.083 --> 13:31.333
We turned the apartment upside down.

13:31.416 --> 13:33.208
Couldn't find the tickets...

13:33.291 --> 13:35.541
I'm going to show you three tickets here.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.166
... until finally,
I found a Dodger envelope.

13:38.250 --> 13:40.916
[Todd] Which of these tickets
was the one that you possessed?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.583
The next thing that I did
was I contacted Sam Fernandez.

13:45.666 --> 13:48.083
Senior Vice President,
General Counsel for the Dodgers.

13:49.416 --> 13:52.166
I don't really know
what was going through my mind

13:52.250 --> 13:53.916
when I received that call.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.458
"Well, here's another interesting day
at the office," if you will.

13:58.666 --> 14:01.000
He came to the stadium
and we walked down to the seats.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.750
[Todd]  I wanted
to take photos of the seats,

14:03.833 --> 14:06.375
where they were
in relation to the Dodger dugout.

14:07.125 --> 14:10.250
[chuckles]  I mean,
I am standing in Dodger Stadium.

14:11.833 --> 14:13.375
[Juan]  I was shackled up

14:13.916 --> 14:19.875
and put into a individual cage
in the jail bus.

14:20.708 --> 14:22.791
I definitely felt...

14:24.625 --> 14:26.708
that it had just become...

14:27.833 --> 14:30.333
That... it just became real.

14:30.416 --> 14:33.291
I saw a county bus.
I was coming home from work.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.166
Uh...

14:35.250 --> 14:38.500
And I just had this weird feeling
inside of me,

14:38.583 --> 14:41.500
and I just broke down crying
by myself in the car.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.666
Juan got his phone call
later on that evening,

14:45.750 --> 14:48.916
and calls me and tells me,
"Alma, I saw you on the freeway."

14:49.333 --> 14:50.708
I'm like, "No way!"

14:50.791 --> 14:52.750
He's like, "I saw you on the freeway."

14:53.208 --> 14:56.041
He's like, "I saw you.
You were about to get the 5 to go home,

14:56.125 --> 14:58.166
and we kept going the opposite way."

14:58.250 --> 15:00.750
He's like, "I wish I could have jumped
out of that window

15:00.833 --> 15:01.875
and go home with you."

15:05.583 --> 15:07.875
[Fernandez]  Really,
what he was looking for was some way

15:07.958 --> 15:09.541
of trying to identify the people

15:09.625 --> 15:11.791
who may have been sitting
around his client,

15:11.875 --> 15:15.083
who could actually testify
that his client was there.

15:15.708 --> 15:18.666
[Todd]  They are season tickets
that Juan got from somebody.

15:18.750 --> 15:22.000
Because someone's a season ticket holder
doesn't mean they were at that game.

15:23.333 --> 15:26.583
[Todd]  So we tracked down people
as far west as Hawaii,

15:27.083 --> 15:29.416
and as far east as Chicago.

15:29.916 --> 15:33.666
Everybody we talked to: "You know,
I really didn't see them well enough

15:33.750 --> 15:35.875
that I would feel comfortable testifying."

15:36.500 --> 15:41.125
[Juan]  They transferred me to supermax,
which is maximum security,

15:41.208 --> 15:43.458
with the hardest criminals there.

15:43.958 --> 15:49.041
You really don't know what fear is

15:49.125 --> 15:53.541
until you hear
a grown man screaming for help.

15:56.083 --> 15:59.750
[Todd]  There's another set of cameras
called Dodger Vision.

16:00.625 --> 16:04.375
[Fernandez]  Dodger Vision is what you see
on the big video screens at the stadium.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.166
Our in-house filming.

16:06.791 --> 16:09.666
[Todd]  I painstakingly
went through the videos,

16:09.750 --> 16:13.791
trying to find Juan among 40,000 people.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.791
[laughs] A staggering number, yes.

16:18.666 --> 16:20.208
[Todd]  Since I knew where Juan was,

16:20.291 --> 16:23.500
it was very easy to see the block of seats
and count the rows down.

16:24.208 --> 16:27.375
Every time a right-handed batter
came up to bat,

16:27.458 --> 16:31.166
I was looking for Juan or his friends
in the background.

16:31.916 --> 16:34.458
I felt that I was getting framed.

16:34.541 --> 16:39.083
I know you hear these stories
of people being exonerated

16:39.166 --> 16:41.791
25, 30 years later.

16:42.875 --> 16:46.416
And that would play in my head
over and over and over.

16:47.541 --> 16:50.041
[Todd]  I was putting everything
on super slo-mo.

16:50.125 --> 16:53.708
It took me an entire day
to go through a three-hour game,

16:53.791 --> 16:56.208
because I could not afford
to miss anything.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.416
I was able to find Juan
sitting in those seats.

17:09.708 --> 17:11.958
But the resolution wasn't high enough.

17:14.083 --> 17:15.958
[Juan]  Talking to the kids
was really tough,

17:16.041 --> 17:18.583
because they wanted to know
when I was coming home.

17:19.083 --> 17:20.583
And I didn't have an answer.

17:21.916 --> 17:24.791
[Todd] Did I explain to you
that we have to tell the truth in court?

17:24.875 --> 17:26.875
-Do you remember that?
-[Juan's daughter] Yeah.

17:26.958 --> 17:29.458
[Todd] And if I told you
that this pen was blue,

17:29.541 --> 17:31.583
would that be the truth or a lie?

17:31.666 --> 17:32.791
A lie.

17:32.875 --> 17:35.541
[Todd] And if I told you
that this microphone was white,

17:35.625 --> 17:37.458
would that be the truth or a lie?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.125
A lie.

17:39.208 --> 17:42.125
[Todd] You promise to tell us
the truth from what you remember?

17:42.208 --> 17:43.166
Yeah.

17:43.250 --> 17:45.291
[Todd] Did you go to a Dodger game
with your daddy?

17:45.375 --> 17:47.083
-Yeah.
-[Todd] This year, last year?

17:47.666 --> 17:48.708
Yeah.

17:48.791 --> 17:51.166
Did your daddy buy you
anything during the game?

17:51.250 --> 17:52.875
-Yeah.
-What did he buy you?

17:54.583 --> 17:55.708
[daughter] Um...

17:56.708 --> 17:57.541
Oh...

17:58.541 --> 18:00.125
Ice cream.

18:00.791 --> 18:03.583
And, um... candy.

18:04.708 --> 18:06.500
And, um...

18:08.458 --> 18:12.583
and some Dodgers... um... cards.

18:13.000 --> 18:14.291
[Todd] Some Dodger cards?

18:14.375 --> 18:16.958
Where did he buy the Dodger cards,
do you remember?

18:17.708 --> 18:21.875
[interviewer] If Juan had the alibi,
the Dodger game, why didn't he mention it

18:21.958 --> 18:24.208
when the police were interviewing him
the night he was arrested?

18:24.291 --> 18:25.833
You would have to ask him that.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.416
[Pinner on tape]
What were you doing on the 12th?

18:30.333 --> 18:31.875
[Juan]  Well, I'm going to remember,

18:31.958 --> 18:34.958
and that's hopefully going to clear me up,
dude.

18:36.500 --> 18:41.458
You know, these guys are telling me
that I killed some 16-year-old girl.

18:41.541 --> 18:43.083
Like, the date was...

18:43.791 --> 18:48.000
Like...
It was irrelevant to me at that point.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.958
[Todd]  I asked Juan
some details about the game.

18:54.041 --> 18:59.333
Juan has a fantastic ability
to recall games, plays, details...

18:59.416 --> 19:02.625
He says, "I think they may have been
filming something there."

19:02.708 --> 19:04.958
[Juan]  I've been
to hundreds of Dodger games,

19:05.041 --> 19:07.958
and never have I seen them
film anything there.

19:08.458 --> 19:11.791
And this particular day, they were there.

19:12.583 --> 19:16.541
[Todd]  All he remembered were
security personnel blocking the aisle

19:16.625 --> 19:19.000
and this man walking
up and down the stairs

19:19.125 --> 19:20.625
for the different takes.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.208
So I went back to Dodger Stadium,

19:25.291 --> 19:28.875
walked with Sam
to the Media Relations Department.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.958
The person that was there
pulled out this big calendar book.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.833
I watched her start flipping.
April, May...

19:35.916 --> 19:37.541
And all these pages are blank.

19:38.375 --> 19:39.583
She turns to May 12th,

19:39.666 --> 19:43.000
and damn if there isn't an entry
on May 12th.

19:43.208 --> 19:46.250
It had some kind of obscure
production company name,

19:46.416 --> 19:48.958
I didn't recognize it,
but it had a phone number.

19:49.375 --> 19:52.458
I called it up, and they answered, "HBO."

19:52.833 --> 19:57.333
I get a cold call from a guy,
"This is Todd Melnik, I'm a lawyer,"

19:57.416 --> 19:59.916
and he tells me this crazy story.

20:00.000 --> 20:04.083
He says, "Well, we don't usually release
any pre-production footage.

20:04.166 --> 20:07.916
You'll have to wait until it airs."

20:08.000 --> 20:10.500
My first thought is, "This guy's nuts."

20:10.583 --> 20:13.958
And secondly,
"There's 56,000 people at this game.

20:14.041 --> 20:15.791
How could this guy possibly be on camera?"

20:15.875 --> 20:17.291
I said, "I need to find anything.

20:17.375 --> 20:20.916
I need to place my client
at Dodger Stadium on that night."

20:21.000 --> 20:22.541
In the meantime, I talked to Larry,

20:22.625 --> 20:26.208
and I'm like, "Larry, there's this guy
that says, you know, his guy's in jail,

20:26.291 --> 20:29.416
and he's a lawyer and...
they remember camera crews being there,

20:29.500 --> 20:30.458
and they think it's us."

20:31.041 --> 20:32.375
Uh... What's that song?

20:32.458 --> 20:33.291
[whistles]

20:33.375 --> 20:34.583
What is that song?

20:34.666 --> 20:37.208
[whistling
John Philip Sousa's "The Thunderer"]

20:42.416 --> 20:44.291
[ Curb Your Enthusiasm  theme song playing]

20:44.375 --> 20:47.208
[Gibbons] Curb Your Enthusiasm
was a comedy that was on HBO.

20:47.291 --> 20:49.333
Starred Larry David,
the creator of  Seinfeld.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.791
At the time, the name Larry David
didn't ring a bell to me.

20:53.916 --> 20:58.250
I had no idea that he was
this mega-huge Hollywood star.

20:58.333 --> 21:02.166
He's right, of course, in referring to me
as a mega-huge star.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.458
That's totally accurate about me.

21:04.541 --> 21:06.333
So he said,
"Okay, when can you come down?"

21:06.416 --> 21:08.416
I said, "Tomorrow?"
He says, "Okay, tomorrow."

21:08.500 --> 21:11.708
Just hearing
that he was going to go down there

21:11.791 --> 21:14.541
and see this, you know, these outtakes,

21:14.625 --> 21:17.625
it just lifted my spirits instantly.

21:18.208 --> 21:20.291
This episode was called
"The Carpool Lane."

21:20.375 --> 21:23.333
It was the seventh episode of season four.

21:24.250 --> 21:27.208
[David]  You should see the traffic.
The only thing moving is the carpool lane.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.083
I'll never make it. I'm going home.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.666
The episode was that I picked up a hooker
in the carpool lane

21:31.750 --> 21:33.000
and took her to Dodger Stadium.

21:33.791 --> 21:36.333
Hey, Daddy.
You want a date with Momma?

21:36.875 --> 21:40.458
Monena. I got a red snapper
that'll talk to you, Daddy.

21:41.208 --> 21:42.625
[laughs]

21:45.875 --> 21:46.791
Get in the car.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.458
[man]  I'd never seen the show,
heard of the show,

21:49.541 --> 21:52.708
I didn't have HBO, so I didn't have
any exposure to the show.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.833
I was a runner, I was a PA.

21:54.916 --> 21:57.083
You know, "Go deliver this here,
go pick this up,

21:57.166 --> 21:59.000
bring it back to the office,"
sort of thing.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.333
So I had no clue what I was getting into.

22:01.416 --> 22:03.916
I knew that we were going to have to find
a baseball stadium

22:04.000 --> 22:06.208
and fill it with thousands of extras,

22:06.291 --> 22:08.958
and, of course, he wanted to do
the Dodgers, since it's L.A.

22:09.041 --> 22:11.875
[laughs] That right there
was a huge uh-oh.

22:11.958 --> 22:14.750
We are part of the entertainment
community in Los Angeles,

22:14.833 --> 22:16.375
and we do want to cooperate.

22:16.458 --> 22:19.333
They came back and said,
"All right, here's what we could do."

22:21.000 --> 22:23.916
We showed up, I believe it was
in the late afternoon,

22:24.000 --> 22:26.083
four or five o'clock was the call time.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.791
Now, I didn't understand, I was like,

22:27.875 --> 22:30.333
"How are we going to shoot
at a real game? This is crazy."

22:30.416 --> 22:32.208
I know the seats
ain't way the fuck up here.

22:32.291 --> 22:33.500
Got a problem with the seats?

22:33.583 --> 22:36.041
You said we had good seats,
club seats and shit.

22:36.125 --> 22:37.958
[David]  We shot in two sections.

22:38.041 --> 22:40.500
I don't know if they call it
a grandstand at Dodger Stadium,

22:40.583 --> 22:41.416
the upper deck...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.875
It's very arbitrary, where we were placed.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.375
[Whitley]  I never saw the cameras
at the Dodger game.

22:47.458 --> 22:49.583
I don't know if people
even knew people were filming.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.500
[Gibbons]  We had a very, very long lens.

22:53.583 --> 22:56.125
The whole thing was
we needed to be almost invisible.

22:56.208 --> 23:00.208
I had to be in bad seats
and then see Bob Einstein.

23:00.291 --> 23:02.625
He played Marty Funkhouser on the show.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.541
[Todd]  So I went
to the  Curb Your Enthusiasm  studios

23:05.625 --> 23:06.541
in Santa Monica,

23:06.625 --> 23:08.791
and I get put into an editing bay.

23:08.875 --> 23:12.625
They had an engineer that was putting in
these beta tapes one by one

23:12.708 --> 23:14.125
and playing them for me.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.291
[general chatter]

23:20.791 --> 23:23.250
[Gajic]  I just remember it being chaos,
to be honest with you.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.291
You've got two or three people

23:26.458 --> 23:28.541
trying to hold back thousands of people.

23:29.458 --> 23:33.208
Midway through the game, my daughter
asked me for, I don't remember,

23:33.291 --> 23:35.666
ice cream, popcorn, candy, something...

23:36.375 --> 23:37.916
[Todd]  There was about eight tapes

23:38.000 --> 23:40.916
and we're putting in
tape after tape after tape.

23:41.000 --> 23:44.458
We went up to the concessions stands,
and I bought her what she wanted.

23:44.583 --> 23:46.208
[Todd]  We start to roll the scenes

23:46.291 --> 23:48.958
and, you know,
there's some shots of Bob Einstein.

23:49.041 --> 23:52.708
-Hey, Larry, I see you got a ticket!
-Yeah, the seats really stink though.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.250
[Juan]  When I got back, there was
a camera crew right on our aisle.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.541
[Gibbons]  We weren't supposed to stop
people walking up and down the aisle,

24:01.625 --> 24:05.291
but if they didn't want to be on camera,
we would say, "Can you wait one minute?"

24:05.375 --> 24:06.875
-Can I join you?
-No.

24:07.458 --> 24:08.291
Why not?

24:08.375 --> 24:12.375
I grabbed my daughter's hand
and I tried to walk down the stairs,

24:12.458 --> 24:13.291
but I was stopped.

24:13.375 --> 24:15.625
-You won't let me sit there?!
-Not even for a minute!

24:15.708 --> 24:19.541
These are paying customers.
We can't hold them for too long.

24:19.958 --> 24:22.083
[Todd]  There's only about
maybe six minutes a tape

24:22.166 --> 24:23.333
on each of these beta tapes,

24:23.416 --> 24:25.791
and we're already
on tape number five or six.

24:25.875 --> 24:27.625
And I'm getting disheartened.

24:27.708 --> 24:28.666
[shouting]

24:28.750 --> 24:30.041
[David] Oh no!

24:30.666 --> 24:33.291
The same guy who stopped me,
he looked over at me,

24:33.375 --> 24:36.791
and then he was just like,
"Hey, you know what? Just go ahead."

24:37.916 --> 24:39.500
And nobody was being let in.

24:40.500 --> 24:41.416
Thanks.

24:41.666 --> 24:44.375
[Gajic]  I probably didn't even know
we were rolling the camera.

24:44.458 --> 24:49.000
And if I did, I was probably a shitty PA
and let them through anyway.

25:19.958 --> 25:24.041
-I literally jumped out of my chair.
-He literally sprung out of his chair.

25:24.125 --> 25:25.500
And there was this gasp.

25:26.583 --> 25:27.791
And there he was.

25:28.416 --> 25:29.416
Pretty cool!

25:32.125 --> 25:33.541
[Gajic]  Is that them right there?

25:39.208 --> 25:40.208
Wow.

25:44.583 --> 25:45.666
[chuckles]

25:48.166 --> 25:50.458
We roll it back, confirm yes, it is him,

25:50.541 --> 25:52.291
we keep playing the tape,

25:52.875 --> 25:54.833
and he's on two more cassettes.

25:56.541 --> 25:58.625
I thought, "Wow, this is fantastic,

25:58.708 --> 26:01.875
I'm going to be able to prove
that he was at the game."

26:03.125 --> 26:05.875
[Juan]  I said, "Todd, what happened?"

26:06.375 --> 26:10.333
And he said, "Dude, you're on the tape."

26:10.416 --> 26:13.833
And I was just like...
I think I let the phone go.

26:13.916 --> 26:15.375
I think I let the phone go.

26:15.458 --> 26:19.125
Then I asked him about,
"When was this shot?

26:19.208 --> 26:22.333
Do you guys know
what time of the game this was shot?"

26:22.416 --> 26:26.083
We shoot with time code,
which is time of day.

26:26.166 --> 26:30.000
The stamp that's put on the video tape
that you can't see, it's electronic.

26:30.083 --> 26:32.791
So we knew exactly what time
he was being shot at.

26:32.875 --> 26:36.958
The first scene was at 8:55,
the last scene was at 9:15.

26:38.291 --> 26:41.666
Of course, it was really... It was
pretty exciting, to tell you the truth.

26:42.500 --> 26:46.458
[Todd]  I looked at this video as being
the holy grail of Juan's defense.

26:48.208 --> 26:51.833
Except the murder took place at 10:32.

26:52.916 --> 26:53.791
Crap.

26:55.333 --> 26:57.708
What else do we need? You know?

26:57.791 --> 27:01.875
I'm on the video the day
they're saying that I killed this girl.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.750
Isn't that enough?

27:06.791 --> 27:09.166
[Silverman]  At 10:43 at night,

27:09.250 --> 27:12.375
our defendant, by his own evidence,
his own witnesses,

27:12.458 --> 27:17.958
is on the same street as our victim,
dropping off his cousin, Miguel Catalan,

27:18.041 --> 27:21.958
about 100 to 150 yards away
from the murder scene,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.250
at the time of the murder.

27:23.333 --> 27:26.500
[interviewer] So the HBO tape,
in your opinion, is good only for what?

27:27.291 --> 27:28.291
Nothing.

27:28.750 --> 27:32.208
So the prosecution is gonna contend
that you could have left early

27:32.916 --> 27:35.166
and had time to go
and commit that murder.

27:35.833 --> 27:39.625
And... dude,
that just brought me back down.

27:42.875 --> 27:45.000
[Todd]  I said,
"I've got to figure out a way

27:45.083 --> 27:47.791
to place you
at Dodger Stadium even longer."

27:48.791 --> 27:50.291
Did you buy something there?

27:50.375 --> 27:52.250
And I'm like,
"Yes, I bought a lot of things."

27:52.333 --> 27:54.916
He goes, "Did you use a credit card?"
I'm like, "No."

27:55.000 --> 27:56.833
Then we started talking about cell phones.

27:58.375 --> 28:01.791
There's a call at 10:11 in the evening,

28:01.875 --> 28:04.000
for 49 seconds, an inbound call.

28:04.375 --> 28:07.083
-Whose phone number is that?
-[Alma] My friend.

28:07.583 --> 28:09.458
[Todd] And did you call Juan
from her phone?

28:09.541 --> 28:10.583
Yes, I did.

28:11.583 --> 28:14.416
I kept calling Juan and calling Juan,
and I'm like, "Is the game over?"

28:14.500 --> 28:16.958
I said, "We're walking out of the stadium
right now."

28:17.041 --> 28:19.958
And that was maybe about 10:10,
I want to say.

28:20.041 --> 28:22.416
-[Todd] Do you recognize that number?
-That's my number.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.125
But I don't remember
if he called me or I called him.

28:25.208 --> 28:28.125
You have to remember
every little detail of your life.

28:28.208 --> 28:30.416
You always think
it may not happen to you, but...

28:31.000 --> 28:33.250
Only in the movies, only on TV...

28:34.000 --> 28:37.125
[Todd]  I knew, from being involved
as a commentator

28:37.208 --> 28:38.708
on the O.J. Simpson case,

28:38.791 --> 28:41.041
when he was doing his slow-speed chase,

28:41.125 --> 28:44.083
that the police were able to find out
which cell towers

28:44.166 --> 28:47.916
were pinging off of his cell phone
when the call was transmitted.

28:48.666 --> 28:49.916
That's how they found him.

28:51.208 --> 28:56.583
The very first phone call I got from Todd
was after the subpoena was released.

28:57.875 --> 29:00.500
We basically released
phone records, wire taps

29:00.583 --> 29:04.041
for, you know, law enforcement agencies,
and different types of entities.

29:04.875 --> 29:08.833
And I just happened to get that case
just by the luck of the draw, you know.

29:08.916 --> 29:11.166
What's the first number
that you recognize?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.083
Mine.

29:12.166 --> 29:13.708
[Boggs]  Due to the nature of the case,

29:13.791 --> 29:15.833
Todd was very, very persistent.

29:16.750 --> 29:20.291
It was one of those situations
where it had to go above and beyond

29:20.375 --> 29:22.166
because we had the ability to see

29:22.250 --> 29:25.833
what cell tower the actual phone calls
were pinging off of.

29:25.916 --> 29:29.333
It's going to show exactly where
a person is at a certain time period.

29:32.916 --> 29:34.541
[Todd]  The cell tower Juan had used

29:34.625 --> 29:37.458
was right across the street
from Dodger Stadium,

29:37.541 --> 29:40.833
and the radius
for that particular one is a mile.

29:41.875 --> 29:46.666
So I knew Juan was at Dodger Stadium
at at least 10:12.

29:47.375 --> 29:51.750
[Todd] Which cell tower was used
to receive that call at 10:11 at night?

29:52.416 --> 29:57.833
10:11 at night,
the cell site was NCA 6581...

29:57.916 --> 30:03.708
[woman]  Rather than giving me a diagram
of whose phone number was whose,

30:03.791 --> 30:07.958
I was listening to numbers,
trying to record numbers and times,

30:08.041 --> 30:11.583
and I was really befuddled.

30:13.250 --> 30:14.791
All I knew about the case

30:14.875 --> 30:19.208
was the defendant was
possibly looking at a death sentence

30:19.291 --> 30:21.500
if he were ultimately convicted.

30:22.166 --> 30:26.750
And that frightened me... beyond words.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.541
[Dunn]  In a preliminary hearing,

30:31.625 --> 30:35.833
am I going to send this person
on to a jury trial,

30:35.916 --> 30:38.791
or am I going to make the decision
to dismiss it?

30:39.291 --> 30:43.000
I was always aware
of the pressure of time.

30:43.666 --> 30:46.541
[Juan]  I would go into the court
with Todd, sit down...

30:47.041 --> 30:52.291
Ten, fifteen minutes max, they would talk
back and forth in lawyer jargon

30:52.375 --> 30:55.208
and stuff I didn't know
what they were talking about.

30:57.416 --> 31:02.375
Okay, see you next date, and next date,
and on, it went like that.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.708
[Dunn]  I agreed, to save time,

31:05.791 --> 31:10.791
that I would take
the interrogation audio tape home with me.

31:11.791 --> 31:15.125
I knew that I could listen to it
as many times as I wanted to,

31:15.916 --> 31:17.000
which I did.

31:17.625 --> 31:20.125
[Juan on tape]  You guys are making
the biggest mistake.

31:20.708 --> 31:23.458
[Pinner]  This night, you made
the biggest mistake of your life.

31:23.541 --> 31:25.208
[Juan on tape]  No. No.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.291
You guys are going to remember this,

31:27.375 --> 31:31.208
because you guys are trying to pin
somebody that had nothing to do with this.

31:31.750 --> 31:35.416
I listened to that tape
over and over and over again.

31:35.500 --> 31:37.500
I made my children listen to it.

31:38.333 --> 31:42.333
And I kept asking them,
as I was really asking myself,

31:42.416 --> 31:45.208
"Is this the voice of a guilty man?"

31:46.041 --> 31:47.458
[low chatter]

31:52.500 --> 31:55.333
[Juan]  I was waiting for Todd
to come in to brief me.

31:56.083 --> 31:59.833
I remember, he told me that,
as soon as I walked in that door,

32:00.458 --> 32:04.250
not to look over to the audience side,
which was on the left side.

32:05.208 --> 32:08.541
Martha's family was in the seats.

32:10.791 --> 32:14.791
[Dunn]  I remember being anguished
by this case.

32:15.416 --> 32:17.125
I couldn't get it out of my mind.

32:18.375 --> 32:19.833
And I vacillated,

32:21.833 --> 32:24.250
trying to determine
how I was going to rule.

32:25.541 --> 32:28.458
Martha Puebla was at stake for me.

32:29.041 --> 32:31.541
[Todd] This man
would be facing the death penalty

32:31.625 --> 32:33.625
if he hadn't, by the grace of God,

32:34.000 --> 32:36.291
gotten Dodger tickets
from someone the day before

32:36.375 --> 32:37.916
and invited these people,

32:38.000 --> 32:41.625
got caught on video from that HBO show...

32:41.708 --> 32:45.666
You heard the tape of the interview
with Detective Pinner.

32:45.750 --> 32:49.208
It is clearly a one-witness ID case.

32:49.291 --> 32:53.250
However, the one witness in this case
is extremely credible,

32:54.125 --> 32:55.958
has no motive to lie,

32:56.416 --> 33:00.583
and made a composite drawing
with a composite artist

33:00.666 --> 33:04.666
that is strikingly similar
to the defendant's appearance.

33:05.375 --> 33:11.333
I don't have any doubt that eyewitness
attempted to be credible,

33:11.416 --> 33:15.000
but he observed this murder
on a darkened residential street

33:15.083 --> 33:18.041
under obviously the most traumatic
of circumstances.

33:18.125 --> 33:21.125
[Juan]  She started talking and talking,

33:21.208 --> 33:22.458
and talking...

33:22.916 --> 33:25.875
And I didn't understand one word she said.

33:25.958 --> 33:30.416
Todd's sitting to my left,
and he leans over.

33:31.625 --> 33:34.000
And then he says, "It's over."

33:36.583 --> 33:37.916
And I said, "What?"

33:38.875 --> 33:40.583
And then...

33:44.250 --> 33:48.125
-[woman] We're gonna get in trouble!
-[Alma] Oh, my God!

33:49.958 --> 33:52.333
[Alma] Go over and give your daddy a hug!

33:53.500 --> 33:57.833
[both speaking indistinctly]

34:05.333 --> 34:06.458
Hi!

34:09.166 --> 34:10.208
[sniffling]

34:11.750 --> 34:13.250
Everything's over.

34:14.875 --> 34:17.791
[women speaking Spanish and laughing]

34:17.875 --> 34:18.916
[Alma] Sorry, Todd.

34:19.000 --> 34:21.000
-Thank you, Todd.
-You're welcome, man.

34:22.375 --> 34:23.291
[Todd sighs]

34:23.375 --> 34:25.250
-I owe you, dude.
-It's all right.

34:25.916 --> 34:27.125
[Alma] You owe him your life!

34:27.208 --> 34:28.458
-I owe you.
-All right.

34:29.916 --> 34:32.291
[Juan]  Todd gave me
one last hug and just...

34:33.916 --> 34:36.875
It seemed like he just rode off
into the sunset, like a...

34:36.958 --> 34:38.250
[chuckles]

34:38.333 --> 34:39.333
As he should.

34:39.416 --> 34:43.583
And, you know, left me there
with my family and...

34:44.333 --> 34:46.291
I got into the car and they said...

34:46.958 --> 34:51.000
You know, they were all super excited
and happy, as I was,

34:51.083 --> 34:53.500
and they're like,
"Okay, okay, what do you want?

34:53.583 --> 34:55.208
We'll buy you whatever."

34:55.291 --> 34:57.666
And I was like, "All I want...

34:58.166 --> 35:00.125
All I want, honestly,

35:00.666 --> 35:01.750
is a Coke.

35:01.833 --> 35:02.750
I didn't have...

35:03.166 --> 35:05.750
You have no soda,
no nothing in there, dude.

35:05.833 --> 35:07.916
All I wanted was a Coke, that's all.

35:10.291 --> 35:12.708
[interviewer]  Do you know
what incriminating evidence is?

35:12.791 --> 35:13.666
-Yes.
-All right.

35:13.750 --> 35:16.125
Were you asking Mr. Catalan questions

35:16.208 --> 35:20.666
to try to obtain
an incriminating response?

35:23.291 --> 35:24.333
Yes.

35:32.750 --> 35:36.333
[interviewer] Did you try to trick
Juan Catalan after he was arrested,

35:36.583 --> 35:40.000
with the circle around his picture?

35:42.041 --> 35:43.041
Yes, sir.

35:43.125 --> 35:46.083
[interviewer] That was...
dishonest, right?

35:58.708 --> 36:00.208
[man]  We're going to begin

36:00.291 --> 36:03.333
with the United States attorney,
Deborah Wong Yang.

36:03.416 --> 36:06.500
The indictment alleges
that several members of the gang

36:06.583 --> 36:09.083
murdered a 16-year-old girl,

36:09.166 --> 36:12.250
who had witnessed
the gang's wrongdoings

36:12.333 --> 36:14.000
and was cooperating with police.

36:23.083 --> 36:26.208
Maybe, I don't know, every few years,

36:26.291 --> 36:29.750
somebody will bring it up or something,
and I'll tell the story.

36:29.833 --> 36:33.750
Maybe I'll tell it at a party,
how I got a guy off of a murder.

36:33.833 --> 36:35.375
You know, um...

36:35.875 --> 36:38.375
Impress a date with it, I don't know.

36:39.916 --> 36:42.541

[Alma]  The thing that keeps repeating
in my head, over and over

37:00.500 --> 37:01.708
and over and over,

37:01.791 --> 37:06.875
is imagine he would have stayed home
to watch that game.

37:06.958 --> 37:09.708
Who were they going to believe?
His mom? Me?

37:10.958 --> 37:13.083
My daughter? "Oh, my daddy was here."

37:13.166 --> 37:14.666
How, how do you prove--

37:15.416 --> 37:16.833
It's just crazy.

[Fernandez]  It's a dangerous thing to do,

37:27.958 --> 37:31.750
to go around viewing life
from the "What if?" perspective.

37:33.083 --> 37:35.666
What if we hadn't done
the deal with Larry David?

37:35.750 --> 37:39.416
What if the camera crew hadn't gone
to that aisle on the field double?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.083
What if his daughter had decided
that she didn't want to go to the game?

37:44.916 --> 37:46.750
What if he hadn't made the phone call?

37:47.666 --> 37:49.125
What if, what if, what if...

37:51.750 --> 37:53.458
All of life is "What if?"

37:53.541 --> 37:55.958
The next couple of minutes is a "What if?"

37:57.125 --> 37:58.916
[distant baseball commentary]

37:59.000 --> 38:03.250
[commentator]  ...you can now be sure
that we're gonna see John Smoltz.
