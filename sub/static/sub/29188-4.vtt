00:09.052 --> 00:10.097
Previously onWhy Women Kill...

00:10.140 --> 00:12.621
I have a date.With your married man.

00:12.664 --> 00:13.622
It's at this
really fancy nightclub.

00:13.665 --> 00:15.711
He's taking you out.

00:15.754 --> 00:17.887
In public.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.889
I thought Rob was taking her
to the club tonight.

00:19.932 --> 00:22.761
Do you honestly think
I'm going to let that happen?

00:22.805 --> 00:23.980
Listen, when you were
in my office earlier,

00:24.024 --> 00:25.808
did you happen to move
any papers?

00:25.851 --> 00:27.940
I know better
than to touch your things.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.507
I'll have to stay late
and redo it.

00:31.683 --> 00:33.381
APRIL:
Would you like to come with me
to the club tonight?

00:33.424 --> 00:34.382
Rob canceled on me.

00:34.425 --> 00:35.687
I love music.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.994
I used to play the piano.Do you still play?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.736
My husband...
didn't care for my playing.

00:40.779 --> 00:43.043
Oh, honey.
Your husband's dead.

00:43.086 --> 00:45.654
Don't you think it's time
you stopped listening to him?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.484
Honey!

00:49.527 --> 00:51.312
TOMMY: Maybe when Mr. Grove moves out,

00:51.355 --> 00:52.313
we could start doing this
in your bed.

00:52.356 --> 00:53.662
He won't be leaving

00:53.705 --> 00:55.316
until after
my daughter's wedding.

00:55.359 --> 00:57.318
Well, it--
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:57.361 --> 00:58.623
That's two months away.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.625
She gave me her hand
in marriage.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.627
SIMONE: Karl...KARL: And I'm
never going

01:02.671 --> 01:04.716
to let it go.
Oh!

01:04.760 --> 01:05.848
KARL:
Bloody hell!

01:05.891 --> 01:07.110
I got fired.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.372
I'm not surprised.

01:08.416 --> 01:09.678
Simone...
One day,

01:09.721 --> 01:10.679
I will divorce Karl,

01:10.722 --> 01:11.984
but I will never hate him.

01:12.028 --> 01:13.116
Where does that leave me?

01:13.160 --> 01:14.726
In the back of a van,

01:14.770 --> 01:16.119
having a marvelous time.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.642
Van came with the job, so...

01:17.686 --> 01:19.122
We'll figure it out.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.993
I'm not worried
about Duke anymore.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.691
He stopped texting me.

01:22.734 --> 01:23.953
ELI: So what's
his deal?

01:23.996 --> 01:25.302
Is he crazy?
A little.

01:25.346 --> 01:26.912
He was always accusing me
of cheating on him.

01:26.956 --> 01:28.653
Come with us
to Venice tomorrow.

01:28.697 --> 01:31.439
Oh, my God!Tomorrow? Really?

01:31.482 --> 01:33.876
Are you going to Venice?I don't know yet.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.356
ELI:
I asked you,

01:35.399 --> 01:36.661
before, if you were
in love with her.

01:36.705 --> 01:39.360
Jade is the only thing
in my life that is easy.

01:39.403 --> 01:40.404
Live with us.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.014
Be with us.

01:42.058 --> 01:43.581
You just got home.

The purpose of an autopsy
is to provide clarity.

03:02.138 --> 03:04.967
How did the victim die?

03:05.010 --> 03:08.797
Was death the result
of a gunshot?

03:10.190 --> 03:11.669
Stabbing?

03:14.150 --> 03:15.978
Poison?

03:16.021 --> 03:19.590
How someone is killed
is easy to understand.

03:19.634 --> 03:23.855
Why it happened,
that's never so simple.

03:23.899 --> 03:28.730
But it always begins
with a choice.

03:28.773 --> 03:31.080
It might be a decision

03:31.123 --> 03:34.736
to conduct a tawdry affair.

03:34.779 --> 03:38.522
A plan to keep secrets
from a loved one.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.178
Or an agreement

03:42.222 --> 03:46.748
to bring a stranger
into your bed.

03:46.791 --> 03:51.622
Yes. People make all sorts
of questionable choices.

03:51.666 --> 03:56.061
Of course, that's what
keeps me in business.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.768
Our waitress
is giving me odd looks.

04:06.811 --> 04:09.161
You're wearing sunglasses
indoors, at night.

04:09.205 --> 04:12.077
I think she recognizes me.I don't even
recognize you

04:12.121 --> 04:14.254
and we've had sex ten times.

04:14.297 --> 04:15.516
Lower your voice.Relax.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.909
Nobody here recognizes you.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.782
Let me see your eyes.

04:24.568 --> 04:27.789
So, I got you a present.

04:27.832 --> 04:30.531
Jewelry?

04:30.574 --> 04:32.576
You shouldn't have.

04:37.625 --> 04:38.887
It's called a Swatch.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.628
And...

04:40.671 --> 04:42.238
it's waterproof.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.197
Oh, so it's safe
from my tears of joy.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.549
I wanted
to do something special.

04:48.592 --> 04:49.898
It's our first date.

04:49.941 --> 04:52.553
I mean, outside of the van.

04:52.596 --> 04:54.990
I'm not sure I'd call it a date.

04:55.033 --> 04:58.123
Why not? We're at a table,
and there's food.

05:00.648 --> 05:03.041
I wouldn't call it food, either.

05:03.085 --> 05:04.913
You don't make it very easy
to be your boyfriend.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.349
Boyfriend?

05:06.393 --> 05:08.612
Ah, another word
you don't like.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.746
It's just not
how I would describe you.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.748
What would you call me, then?

05:13.791 --> 05:17.099
Your lover?
Why do you need

05:17.142 --> 05:18.361
a job title?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.755
What's wrong with "Tommy"?

05:21.973 --> 05:24.933
Are you gonna put it on?

05:24.976 --> 05:27.109
Why would I do that?

05:27.152 --> 05:29.894
Because it's a gift,
and I'm asking you to.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.635
Oh, for God's sake.

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
What's wrong?

05:33.420 --> 05:35.247
Am-am I embarrassing you?

05:35.291 --> 05:37.032
Shh. Shush. Sit down.

05:37.075 --> 05:38.860
Oh, I'm sorry.
Next time, I'll buy you a gift

05:38.903 --> 05:40.775
that you'll actually wear
on a date with me,

05:40.818 --> 05:42.733
like a ski mask.

05:42.777 --> 05:44.126
Tommy.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.302
Uh, what did I do now?

05:50.915 --> 05:52.308
Can I get you anything else
to eat?

05:52.352 --> 05:55.877
Oh, God, no.
The food is dreadful here.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.966
And he's too young for you,

05:58.009 --> 06:00.316
while we're offering
unsolicited opinions.

06:14.765 --> 06:16.985
Sheila. What can I do for you?

06:17.028 --> 06:18.639
I have no food in my house,

06:18.682 --> 06:21.076
and my kids are starting
to make some real ugly threats.

06:21.119 --> 06:22.991
Maybe I can find
a jar of peanut butter.

06:23.034 --> 06:25.385
That's more
than they deserve.

06:27.691 --> 06:29.301
What's with the skates?

06:29.345 --> 06:31.652
BETH ANN:
They're cute, huh?
Rob bought them for me

06:31.695 --> 06:32.914
on our first date.

06:32.957 --> 06:34.176
He took me to
Happytime Roller Rink.

06:34.219 --> 06:35.743
So why are you
digging them up now?

06:35.786 --> 06:38.746
I'm going skating
later today, with April.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.835
The waitress?Oh, yes.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.359
Last week, we went
to an Andy Warhol exhibit.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.187
Next week,
she's going to teach me to surf.

06:45.230 --> 06:48.973
Can you imagine? Me, surfing?

06:49.017 --> 06:50.845
I thought the plan was
to gain the girl's trust

06:50.888 --> 06:53.108
and convince her
to end the affair.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.762
That's what I'm doing.

06:54.805 --> 06:56.764
You sure?
'Cause it sounds like

06:56.807 --> 06:58.287
the two of you
are becoming close.

06:58.330 --> 07:00.463
Well, maybe a little.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.987
April is very sweet.

07:03.031 --> 07:04.989
She's so free-spirited.

07:05.033 --> 07:07.383
You wouldn't believe
the fun we have together.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.298
Mm-hmm. She sounds nice.

07:09.341 --> 07:11.692
For a girl who's sleeping
with your husband.

07:11.735 --> 07:13.433
I know it's odd, but I like her.

07:13.476 --> 07:15.347
I can't help it.

07:15.391 --> 07:17.698
What's wrong with her
being a friend?

07:17.741 --> 07:19.700
Nothing.

07:19.743 --> 07:22.746
As long as you don't forget
she's also the enemy.

07:28.099 --> 07:32.800
Okay. Well, how about, uh, you
know, classic "she's our lover"?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.932
Oof. That is
too sexual.

07:34.976 --> 07:38.806
Yeah? All right.
Um, our "special friend"?

07:38.849 --> 07:41.069
That makes me sound slow.

07:42.940 --> 07:47.075
All right. Uh, she's the third
prong of our throuple.

07:47.118 --> 07:49.207
Ugh. Barf.

07:49.251 --> 07:50.731
Well, now that Jade's
gonna live with us,

07:50.774 --> 07:51.993
we got to have some way
to introduce her.

07:54.256 --> 07:57.433
Well, why don't we just say
she's family?

07:57.477 --> 08:00.262
Aww. I love that.ELI:
Yeah.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.221
That's nice.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.397
TAYLOR:
Wait.

08:05.441 --> 08:07.399
Jade, does that look
like Duke's truck to you?

08:07.443 --> 08:10.054
Oh, shit.

08:10.098 --> 08:13.971
Wait, like, like, scary ex Duke?

08:14.015 --> 08:15.538
Did you tell him you
were staying here?

08:15.582 --> 08:18.236
No. I didn't tell anyone.

08:18.280 --> 08:20.238
Oh, God. He's getting
out the car.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.370
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck...Okay, it's okay, it's okay.

08:21.413 --> 08:22.458
Okay, all right, all right.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.155
Look, don't worry.
It's gonna be okay.

08:24.199 --> 08:26.288
I got this.Wait, what do you mean,
you got this?

08:26.331 --> 08:27.811
I'm gonna talk
to him. You know?

08:27.855 --> 08:28.943
Man to man.No. Eli...

08:28.986 --> 08:30.161
No-- don't-- E...

08:30.205 --> 08:32.990
Oh, that's not good. Okay.

08:33.034 --> 08:34.949
Can I help you?

08:34.992 --> 08:36.341
Yeah, I'm looking
for my girlfriend.

08:36.385 --> 08:38.256
A guy told me
that she's staying here.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.476
Oh. Uh, who's your girlfriend?

08:40.520 --> 08:41.477
Jade.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.000
Jade.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.567
Jade, Jade, Jade, Jade,
Jade, Jade, Jade...

08:44.611 --> 08:45.916
No-- Jade who?

08:45.960 --> 08:47.265
She's in that window, man.

08:49.354 --> 08:51.792
Oh, Jade. Right. Yeah.Yeah.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.968
I need to talk to her.Oh, okay.
Well, uh, the thing is,

08:54.011 --> 08:55.883
she's not really
available right now, so...Yeah, I think she is.

08:55.926 --> 08:57.406
Yep.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.364
Oh, shit.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.975
All right, look-- look, man.

09:01.018 --> 09:02.498
I don't want to get physical
with you, okay?

09:02.542 --> 09:04.500
You're right. You don't.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.503
What do you think you're doing?

09:07.547 --> 09:09.897
You must be the fuck buddy.

09:09.940 --> 09:12.987
And you must be Duke,
the two-time felon.

09:13.030 --> 09:15.293
Those were both
felonies, right?

09:15.337 --> 09:17.861
So if I were to call
the cops and they came here

09:17.905 --> 09:20.037
to see you committing
a third assault,

09:20.081 --> 09:22.213
that sounds like
three strikes to me.

09:24.128 --> 09:27.958
This is the part where you walk
away to avoid going to prison.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.005
Tell Jade I'll be in touch.

09:38.055 --> 09:40.231
You know, that was unnecessary.

09:40.275 --> 09:42.146
I had it under control.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.932
Honey, it was a team effort.I know.

09:44.975 --> 09:46.629
Thank you so much.

09:46.673 --> 09:48.370
I was so freaked out.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.068
Aww.Oh...

09:51.112 --> 09:52.287
You're my hero.

09:52.330 --> 09:53.854
Jade, I'm not your hero.

09:53.897 --> 09:56.073
I just, I'm--
want to make sure you're okay.

10:03.951 --> 10:06.344
Ooh, we should invite
the Prescotts to the wedding.

10:06.388 --> 10:07.694
Must we?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.391
Well, I can't
stand them, either,

10:09.434 --> 10:11.654
but they spent $10,000
at the gallery last year.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.482
Just put them on the maybe list.

10:13.525 --> 10:15.789
Another maybe?
Amy will be here in an hour.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.356
We promised we'd have
the guest list done.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.011
What about the... Randalls?

10:21.055 --> 10:23.013
Absolutely not. I despise them.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.973
Since when? We went to their
son's wedding a month ago.

10:26.016 --> 10:28.453
And never got a thank you note
for the candy dish.

10:28.497 --> 10:30.542
That's awfully petty.I agree.

10:30.586 --> 10:32.414
How hard is it to
write a simple note?

10:32.457 --> 10:34.372
I meant you.

10:34.416 --> 10:35.678
What is going on?

10:35.722 --> 10:37.549
What do you mean, "going on"?

10:37.593 --> 10:41.118
You've been in a foul mood ever
since you came home last night.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
What could it be?

10:43.425 --> 10:46.950
Hmm. I broke a nail?
No, that's not it.

10:46.994 --> 10:49.126
My husband sleeps with men?
No, couldn't be that.

10:49.170 --> 10:51.389
Fine. Don't tell me.

10:51.433 --> 10:54.784
Look, we have prepaid
the caterer for 400 guests.

10:54.828 --> 10:56.568
If we don't
finish our list,

10:56.612 --> 10:59.876
then Brad's family will invite
more rubes from Oklahoma,

10:59.920 --> 11:02.400
and the entire wedding
will turn into a hoedown.

11:02.444 --> 11:05.055
Do they have hoedowns
in Oklahoma?

11:05.099 --> 11:06.578
Oh, well,
they do in the musical.

11:06.622 --> 11:07.928
First number of act two.

11:07.971 --> 11:11.409
How did I not know
what I was getting with you?

11:11.453 --> 11:12.715
What?

11:14.064 --> 11:16.023
Oh, Amy, you're early.

11:16.066 --> 11:18.547
We haven't quite finished
the guest list yet.

11:18.590 --> 11:21.071
Brad slept
with his ex-girlfriend.

11:21.115 --> 11:24.118
The wedding's off.
I require wine.

11:26.598 --> 11:30.428
♪ Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa... ♪

11:30.472 --> 11:32.430
Watch out, watch ou-- watch out!

11:32.474 --> 11:35.433
♪ Poetry in motion

11:39.481 --> 11:41.657
♪ A wave out on the ocean

11:41.701 --> 11:45.182
♪ Could never move that way...

11:45.226 --> 11:47.837
That was a blast.

11:47.881 --> 11:51.841
Can I just say, every
day I spend with you

11:51.885 --> 11:53.974
feels like an adventure.

11:54.017 --> 11:55.932
We do have fun together,
don't we?

11:55.976 --> 11:57.847
To be honest,

11:57.891 --> 12:00.241
I've been feeling
a little lonely in L.A.

12:01.503 --> 12:03.200
I know how you feel.

12:03.244 --> 12:07.639
It's nice to
have a real girlfriend out here.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.166
Well, it's getting late.
I should go.

12:12.209 --> 12:15.909
Wait, do you think you have time
for one more adventure tonight?

12:15.952 --> 12:17.780
I suppose.

12:17.824 --> 12:20.043
Okay.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.175
April?

12:21.218 --> 12:22.829
What are you up to?

12:27.529 --> 12:29.661
Go ahead. Try one.

12:29.705 --> 12:32.969
Brownies?
How are they an adventure?

12:33.013 --> 12:35.058
My recipe calls
for a special ingredient.

12:35.102 --> 12:37.800
Like what?
Grass.

12:37.844 --> 12:40.237
From your lawn?

12:40.281 --> 12:43.806
No,
I'm talking about pot.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.982
You know, marijuana?

12:46.026 --> 12:48.985
You mean reefer?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.988
Oh. Look, it's not a big deal.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.163
Lots of people do it.

12:53.207 --> 12:55.209
Criminals. Musicians.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.863
Please don't be angry.

12:56.906 --> 12:58.995
You are a good girl.
How could you do such a thing?

12:59.039 --> 13:01.041
Rob wanted to.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.828
Your married man?

13:05.872 --> 13:07.090
Yeah.

13:07.134 --> 13:10.528
That stuns me.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.879
Given how you've described him.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.532
He can be such a square.

13:14.576 --> 13:16.883
I think he was just looking
for a way to cut loose.

13:16.926 --> 13:18.841
Oh.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.584
Look, I really didn't mean
to offend you.

13:22.627 --> 13:26.806
I'm fine. It's just something
I wasn't expecting.

13:29.199 --> 13:30.592
So are we friends again?

13:32.333 --> 13:34.770
Great.
I'll go put these away.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.119
Wait.
Hmm?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.736
Oh, what the heck.

13:53.136 --> 13:55.008
But how did you find out?I've had my suspicions

13:55.051 --> 13:57.880
for a while, and then Brad
finally admitted

13:57.924 --> 13:59.577
that he's been lying
to me about Cindy

13:59.621 --> 14:01.057
the whole time
we've been engaged.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.885
I know so many whores
named Cindy.

14:02.929 --> 14:06.715
And did I mention she's fat?
140 pounds if she's an ounce.

14:06.758 --> 14:09.761
Oh, 140, where did he
find her, a carnival?

14:09.805 --> 14:11.763
You know, darling,
it's not even noon yet.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.983
My fiancé fucked a beluga whale.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.593
Can I please get
some support here?

14:15.637 --> 14:17.682
I'm sorry.

14:17.726 --> 14:21.121
Uh, so he's been sleeping
with Cindy this whole time?

14:21.164 --> 14:22.774
No, I didn't say that.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.776
I'm confused.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.996
He's been lying the whole time.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.085
They hooked up that weekend
you took me to Hawaii.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.870
Hang on, that was
two years ago.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.262
Were you and Brad
even engaged yet?

14:32.306 --> 14:34.612
No, but we were together.

14:34.656 --> 14:36.614
Mm, off and on.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.790
Okay, Brad hadn't
proposed yet,

14:38.834 --> 14:40.227
but we both knew
he was going to.

14:40.270 --> 14:41.619
Exactly.

14:41.663 --> 14:42.925
Yeah, or at least I knew.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.622
Well, maybe you
should've told him.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.102
I can't believe
you're taking Brad's side.

14:46.146 --> 14:47.625
I'm just saying

14:47.669 --> 14:50.019
the situation is not
quite so cut and dried.

14:50.063 --> 14:53.631
Brad is a good man.
You might consider forgiveness.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.982
Forgiveness?

14:56.025 --> 14:58.201
Boy, did you marry
into the wrong family.

14:59.768 --> 15:01.944
I'm going to my room.

15:01.988 --> 15:03.685
Darling, I know
you're upset,

15:03.728 --> 15:07.297
but when you drink
without a glass, Brad wins.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.345
Mmm.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.740
I don't think it's working.

15:15.784 --> 15:18.134
Takes a while to kick in.

15:18.178 --> 15:21.094
I hope I recognize
the sensation.

15:21.137 --> 15:23.052
I'd hate to be high and miss it.

15:23.096 --> 15:26.316
Trust me, you'll know.

15:26.360 --> 15:29.885
Hey, want to order in Chinese
food and listen to records?

15:29.929 --> 15:32.148
Aren't you having dinner
with your married man tonight?

15:32.192 --> 15:34.716
That's tomorrow. Tonight,
Rob has plans with his wife.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.198
What?

15:38.241 --> 15:39.982
I don't know.
It's been planned for weeks.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.244
Some dinner party
with his boss.

15:43.290 --> 15:45.901
Wednesday!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.772
Today is Wednesday.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.035
Yeah. Why?

15:49.078 --> 15:51.689
I was supposed to

15:51.733 --> 15:54.344
feed my neighbor's cat
on Monday.

15:54.388 --> 15:56.433
Oh! Poor Mittens.

15:56.477 --> 15:58.087
I should go.

15:58.131 --> 16:00.698
Damn it!
Where's my other skate?

16:00.742 --> 16:03.701
It's under your armpit.Oh, yes.

16:03.745 --> 16:07.227
Well, thank you
for the reefer.

16:07.270 --> 16:09.011
Yeah.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.904
Where have you been?

16:32.948 --> 16:34.863
We need to leave
in five minutes.

16:34.906 --> 16:37.953
I know, I know.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.824
Were you roller skating?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.202
Whoa.

17:10.986 --> 17:14.120
Come on. We have to go now.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.267
Let's go over
a few things.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.791
When he's out of the office,
my boss likes to be called Hal.

17:33.835 --> 17:35.097
His wife is Vivian.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.230
Vivian.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.101
Dale and Gretchen Clark
will be there. He's tall.

17:39.145 --> 17:42.800
She's brunette. Pamela and Joe,
they'll be the old ones.

17:42.844 --> 17:45.890
And Myron Paul is coming,
he'll be the short one.

17:45.934 --> 17:47.457
Myron is short.

17:47.501 --> 17:50.243
The guest of honor
is Mr. Tashiro from Japan.

17:50.286 --> 17:51.983
Should be obvious who he is.

17:52.027 --> 17:55.509
Why?

17:55.552 --> 17:57.554
Is that a joke?

17:59.556 --> 18:01.428
Sure.

18:08.435 --> 18:12.830
JADE: Duke, please,
I've apologized, like, 20 times.

18:12.874 --> 18:16.138
What? Please,
I'm begging you,

18:16.182 --> 18:17.487
please, don't hurt her.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.403
Duke! Duke, please.

18:20.447 --> 18:23.493
What is wrong
with you?

18:23.537 --> 18:26.235
She's just a baby! Duke!

18:26.279 --> 18:28.846
Hello?

18:28.890 --> 18:31.545
Oh, my God.Jade, what's going on?

18:31.588 --> 18:32.981
Duke is gonna kill Teacup.

18:33.024 --> 18:34.417
Teacup?

18:34.461 --> 18:36.463
Our dog. He says
if I don't meet with him,

18:36.506 --> 18:37.855
he's gonna put her down.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.336
Holy shit.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.469
He can't do that, right?TAYLOR: Legally?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.471
I'm honestly not sure.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.516
You don't think he'd
hurt his own dog, do you?

18:46.560 --> 18:49.171
He went to prison
for choking his accountant.

18:49.215 --> 18:51.913
My dad's
an accountant.

18:51.956 --> 18:53.175
I have to go over there.

18:53.219 --> 18:55.177
I love that dog.

18:55.221 --> 18:56.874
Jade, it's too dangerous.

18:56.918 --> 18:58.398
I don't care.
I have to save Teacup.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.051
Fine, fine,

19:00.095 --> 19:01.618
but you're not going alone.
I will go with you, okay?

19:01.662 --> 19:03.098
Okay.
Okay.

19:03.142 --> 19:05.448
Thank you, thank you.Yes, of course.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.102
Whoa, whoa.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.582
What about me?

19:10.410 --> 19:11.498
I-I'm just saying,
you know, two's good,

19:11.541 --> 19:12.890
three's better, right?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.936
Oh, yeah. Okay.

19:14.979 --> 19:16.677
All right.

19:34.216 --> 19:36.218
Oh.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.525
If that's Brad,
I'm not here.

19:38.568 --> 19:41.484
Hello? Ah, good morning, Brad.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.094
I'm not here!

19:43.138 --> 19:44.661
Yes, actually, Amy's...

19:44.705 --> 19:46.228
Okay, yes, you heard that.

19:46.272 --> 19:47.447
Good!

19:47.490 --> 19:50.276
Look, I-I really
couldn't say, Brad.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.452
I mean, you know women.

19:52.495 --> 19:54.062
Oh, I know.

19:54.105 --> 19:55.498
Tell me about it.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.239
Stop talking to him.

19:57.283 --> 19:59.241
Oh, no, if anything, worse.

19:59.285 --> 20:01.069
No, I know it's
ridiculous, but...

20:01.112 --> 20:03.114
Give me that.

20:05.073 --> 20:07.293
Right, well, uh,
I'm off to the gallery.

20:07.336 --> 20:10.557
I'd love to start the day
with a kiss.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.123
Mm. Ask the gardener.

20:12.167 --> 20:15.083
Oh, I won't make
that mistake twice.Hmm.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.280
Tommy!
I was up

20:38.324 --> 20:39.847
all night thinking
about our date,

20:39.890 --> 20:42.284
and I-I was super upset, but
I should not have walked out,

20:42.328 --> 20:43.981
and I am sorry.Are you crazy?

20:44.025 --> 20:45.156
You can't come to my house
with flowers.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.506
I waited for Karl to leave.

20:46.549 --> 20:48.377
Well, he's not the only one
who could see you.

20:48.421 --> 20:50.988
You have to go now.But, wait, at least
take the flowers.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.425
No!
If you won't accept
a simple gift,

20:52.468 --> 20:53.991
then what does that say
about our future?

20:54.035 --> 20:55.993
We have no future.Are you breaking up with me?

20:56.037 --> 20:56.994
Yes, it's over. Now go.

20:57.038 --> 20:58.518
Tommy Harte?

20:58.561 --> 21:02.217
Amy?

21:02.261 --> 21:05.002
I haven't seen you
since last Christmas.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.527
Yes, it's been
a while.

21:07.570 --> 21:11.052
Hi. So who are the flowers for?

21:13.533 --> 21:16.013
They're for you,
of course.

21:16.057 --> 21:19.060
For me?
How did you know I was here?

21:20.409 --> 21:22.759
What a good question.

21:22.803 --> 21:26.328
Well, I called Naomi

21:26.372 --> 21:28.199
to tell her the
wedding was off,

21:28.243 --> 21:30.201
and she shared
the bad news with Tommy,

21:30.245 --> 21:33.596
and then he brought you
this lovely bouquet.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.598
That's so sweet.

21:35.642 --> 21:38.166
You're welcome.

21:38.209 --> 21:39.559
Tommy, you should really go.

21:39.602 --> 21:42.388
Amy and I have million things
to do today.

21:42.431 --> 21:44.477
I'll just put these
in your room.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.740
Well, it was very nice
to see you, Amy.

21:46.783 --> 21:48.394
Tommy, are you free tonight?

21:50.526 --> 21:52.659
I don't know if you're
seeing anyone these days,

21:52.702 --> 21:55.096
but I could really use
some cheering up.

21:58.839 --> 22:02.364
Well, I was seeing someone,

22:02.408 --> 22:05.759
but, uh, she recently
broke up with me.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.633
Amy! You can't
go out tonight.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.505
We have to let people know
the wedding's off.

22:12.548 --> 22:14.115
So there are
calls to make.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.290
I'll make them tomorrow.

22:16.596 --> 22:18.685
So I'll see you
at Herberto's, 7:00?

22:18.728 --> 22:20.513
We can console each other.

22:20.556 --> 22:23.516
That'll be nice.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.691
Goodbye, Mrs. Grove.

22:28.695 --> 22:32.351
Amy, what could you
possibly be thinking?

22:32.394 --> 22:34.265
Well, I'm thinking
I'm going to have

22:34.309 --> 22:36.224
revenge sex with Tommy Harte.

22:36.267 --> 22:39.836
Well, uh... you can't do that.

22:39.880 --> 22:41.403
He's not even your type.

22:41.447 --> 22:42.578
I know he's a little young,

22:42.622 --> 22:44.754
but he's gotta learn
from someone.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.337
MAN:
So you're-you're telling
me that this took four hours?

23:02.381 --> 23:03.425
WOMAN: Well, yes.

23:03.469 --> 23:04.687
MAN:
That's very impressive.

23:04.731 --> 23:05.688
MAN 2:
That was the quick version.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.126
Oh, there they are. Hey.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.955
We were just about
to send out a search party.

23:11.999 --> 23:15.089
So sorry. It takes Beth Ann
a while to get dressed.Yes.

23:15.132 --> 23:16.830
So I recall.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.226
This is my wife Vivian.

23:22.270 --> 23:24.751
It is so lovely
to meet you, Beth Ann.

23:24.794 --> 23:29.146
And I want to introduce you
to Gretchen and Dale Clarkson,

23:29.190 --> 23:30.713
and Pamela and Joe Kensington.Hi.

23:30.757 --> 23:34.282
Where's Myron?

23:34.325 --> 23:36.371
Oh, Myron had to cancel.Oh.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.025
Oh, here's our guest of honor.

23:38.068 --> 23:40.027
This is the young executive
I was telling you about.

23:40.070 --> 23:41.724
Robert Stanton.Sir, it's an honor.

23:41.768 --> 23:44.727
I've heard a lot of wonderful
things about your work.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.425
I hope I live up
to your expectation.

23:46.468 --> 23:49.993
So Myron's not here?

23:50.037 --> 23:52.256
Uh, no.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.954
MAID:
Dinner is served.

23:53.997 --> 23:56.043
Shall we?Thank goodness.
Yes.

23:56.086 --> 23:58.741
GRETCHEN:
Thank you. I'm starving.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.308
What is your name?

24:00.351 --> 24:02.484
Beth Ann.

24:02.528 --> 24:05.226
You must be Tashiro.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.358
I am.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.492
You were right.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.974
It was obvious.

24:16.803 --> 24:18.369
VIVIAN:
I made place cards for everyone.

24:18.413 --> 24:20.328
HAL: Uh, Mr. Tashiro, you'll be
right here in the center.

24:20.371 --> 24:21.808
TASHIRO:
Thank you.

24:23.505 --> 24:26.160
Um, Beth Ann, did you
find your place card?

24:28.205 --> 24:30.469
Honey?

24:30.512 --> 24:34.124
Sorry, I was looking
at the swan.

24:34.168 --> 24:36.475
Do you like it?

24:36.518 --> 24:39.129
It's the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

24:39.173 --> 24:42.045
That is so sweet
of you to notice.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.438
Most don't.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.135
Rob,

24:45.179 --> 24:48.530
do you see this?

24:48.574 --> 24:51.272
It's very pretty.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.969
Now put it on your lap.

24:53.013 --> 24:55.494
Oh, I don't want to unfold it,
it took too much work.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.539
HAL: It's fine,
Beth Ann, I'm, uh...

24:57.583 --> 24:59.062
I'm sure it's not
thatdifficult.

24:59.106 --> 25:00.499
How would you know?

25:00.542 --> 25:01.804
Sweetie, don't you, uh,

25:01.848 --> 25:02.979
do this at all
our dinner parties?

25:03.023 --> 25:05.286
Well, do you think
that makes it easy?

25:05.329 --> 25:07.549
I'm sure I could do it
if I tried.

25:07.593 --> 25:10.944
I bet you couldn't!

25:12.293 --> 25:13.903
That sounds like a challenge.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.992
No, no, she's not
challenging you.

25:16.036 --> 25:19.430
Make a swan.
I dare you.

25:19.474 --> 25:21.563
HAL :
Well...

25:21.607 --> 25:24.044
...she's feisty.
You're on.

25:24.087 --> 25:26.394
Oh, well, this should be
very interesting.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.831
HAL: Oh, piece of cake.
Come on. How would I begin?

25:28.875 --> 25:30.964
I think you've got to
lay it flat to start.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.227
Brilliant.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.839
HAL: The-the-the trick is in
the first fold, am-am I right?

25:36.883 --> 25:38.580
Well, I'm not helping you.Great.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.582
Wait, wait, wait.
Almost...

25:40.626 --> 25:42.845
Got it.

25:42.889 --> 25:43.890
VIVIAN:
Keep your day job.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.587
Not so easy, is it?

25:45.631 --> 25:47.894
HAL: All right,
I'm gonna get it this time.

25:47.937 --> 25:50.244
I'm going to
get it this time.

25:50.287 --> 25:51.288
Honey, I dropped my fork
on the floor.

25:51.332 --> 25:52.507
Would you get it for me?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.422
Sure.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.294
TASHIRO:
Let me try.

25:57.338 --> 26:01.037
What is wrong with you?Huh?

26:01.081 --> 26:03.126
You're acting like
you're drunk.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.867
Am I?

26:04.911 --> 26:08.044
Oh, that might be the pot.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.611
Pot?

26:09.655 --> 26:12.135
That means marijuana.

26:12.179 --> 26:14.007
I had some before dinner.

26:14.050 --> 26:16.923
Where in God's name
did you get marijuana?

26:16.966 --> 26:19.142
What's wrong?

26:19.186 --> 26:21.101
Am I not allowed
to cut loose?

26:21.144 --> 26:25.061
We will talk about this later.Good.

26:25.105 --> 26:29.588
Then you can tell me where
you get your marijuana.

26:29.631 --> 26:31.590
What?

26:31.633 --> 26:33.069
That's right.

26:34.680 --> 26:37.596
I know what you've
been up to.

26:42.122 --> 26:44.211
HAL: All right.

26:44.254 --> 26:45.386
It's impossible.Oh.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.517
I give up.

26:46.561 --> 26:48.998
VIVIAN: Here, here.
Let me help you.

26:49.042 --> 26:50.434
HAL:
Thank you, my dear.

26:50.478 --> 26:53.960
HAL:
It's more like a duck.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.096
This is it.

27:00.140 --> 27:02.664
Duke's place is
just down the pathway.

27:02.708 --> 27:04.231
Okay...

27:04.274 --> 27:05.624
let's do this.

27:05.667 --> 27:08.409
Okay, why are you
talking like that?

27:08.452 --> 27:09.671
Like what?

27:09.715 --> 27:12.282
Like the star of
a low-budget action film.

27:12.326 --> 27:15.111
What?
I'm not doing that.

27:15.155 --> 27:17.331
: All right,
let's stay close, people.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.466
Here we are.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.381
What's the plan?Okay,

27:24.425 --> 27:25.948
so I'm gonna knock on the door.

27:25.992 --> 27:28.037
When Duke answers,
I'll confront him...

27:28.081 --> 27:31.258
No confronting.
Duke is a violent felon.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.476
Are you crazy?

27:33.564 --> 27:36.350
You brought a hammer?

27:36.393 --> 27:38.134
I prefer to call this "Plan B."

27:38.178 --> 27:40.310
That's your plan B,
aggravated assault?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.312
It's not assault
if he hits me first.

27:42.356 --> 27:44.314
Oh, he will definitely
hit you first.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.969
Great, great, anyway,

27:47.013 --> 27:49.580
so while we're struggling,
Jade's gonna rush in,

27:49.624 --> 27:51.495
she's gonna grab the dog,
and then we run.

27:51.539 --> 27:53.323
Honey, that is
a stupid plan.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.543
That's a bit harsh,
but, okay, fine, you go.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.414
Here's my plan:
Duke opens the door

27:57.458 --> 27:59.373
and I write him a
massive check for the dog.

27:59.416 --> 28:02.593
Oh, that's good.
Duke is always broke.

28:02.637 --> 28:04.987
Fine. I mean, if you want to be
the kind of person

28:05.031 --> 28:06.336
that just solves all
of her problems with money.

28:06.380 --> 28:08.164
I very much do.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.210
Jade, go ahead.

28:13.692 --> 28:16.085
Duke!

28:16.129 --> 28:17.652
Oh, my God.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.523
Oh, my God.

28:19.567 --> 28:21.525
Oh, my God, it's Teacup.

28:21.569 --> 28:23.484
Honey, honey, it's okay.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.399
Mommy's here.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.401
I guess Duke's not home.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.272
No, no, no. No, no, no.

28:29.316 --> 28:31.057
He's definitely,
definitely home.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.623
He doesn't go to work till 5:00.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.063
Come on, Duke,
open up.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.371
Okay.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.460
He's clearly not home.
You know what?

28:43.504 --> 28:46.637
We'll just write him a note
and we'll say that you came by

28:46.681 --> 28:49.553
and you are willing to make him
a generous offer to buy the dog.

28:49.597 --> 28:52.034
W-What, w-we're just
gonna leave her here?

28:52.078 --> 28:55.037
For now, yeah.

28:56.430 --> 28:58.345
Okay, I left my pen in the car.
Hold on.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.392
I don't like this.

29:02.436 --> 29:04.699
I know, but, I mean,
what else can we do?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.745
You don't understand,
if something happens to my dog,

29:06.788 --> 29:08.572
I will fucking
lose my mind.

29:08.616 --> 29:11.401
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.Please, please, please.

29:26.112 --> 29:28.070
Start the car!

29:28.114 --> 29:30.725
What? Oh, shit.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.641
Start the car now.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.512
♪ You know I got the call...

29:35.556 --> 29:37.384
Hey!

29:37.427 --> 29:38.515
♪ You got it

29:38.559 --> 29:40.735
♪ Yeah, do what you do

29:40.779 --> 29:43.433
♪ You unbelievable

29:43.477 --> 29:45.827
♪ It's undeniable You bitch!

29:45.871 --> 29:47.176
♪ You unbelievable You're fucking dead!

29:47.220 --> 29:48.569
♪ It's undeniable.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.883
Mom, have you seen
my car keys?

29:57.926 --> 29:59.754
I'm gonna be late
to meet Tommy.

29:59.798 --> 30:02.365
Sorry.

30:02.409 --> 30:04.803
I could've sworn
they were in my jacket.

30:06.892 --> 30:07.980
What the hell?

30:08.023 --> 30:09.938
I'm going on a date

30:09.982 --> 30:11.157
and you're inviting
Aunt Kay to the wedding?

30:11.200 --> 30:12.941
That makes no sense.

30:12.985 --> 30:16.249
I know she's dull, but she's
good for a gravy boat at least.

30:16.292 --> 30:18.164
I'm not getting married. Okay?

30:18.207 --> 30:20.775
I'm going to meet
Tommy Harte for sex,

30:20.819 --> 30:22.429
if I ever find my damn keys.

30:22.472 --> 30:25.214
Yes, dear. If.

30:27.347 --> 30:28.914
Did you hide my keys?

30:28.957 --> 30:30.306
Yes.

30:30.350 --> 30:32.439
And once you've calmed down,
you'll thank me. Sit.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.528
No! Where are my keys?

30:34.571 --> 30:36.269
They're not in my purse.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.100
I told you they
weren't in there.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.885
Fine, keep the keys. I'll walk.In those heels,

30:43.929 --> 30:45.931
you won't make it
past the driveway.

30:45.974 --> 30:48.324
I know you're upset,
but if you sleep with Tommy,

30:48.368 --> 30:50.544
you're slamming the door
on Brad forever.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.285
I know. That's the point.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.504
But you love him,
and he loves you.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.376
The hall's booked,
the caterer's been paid,

30:56.419 --> 30:58.117
your dress is gorgeous.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.815
Why are you on Brad's side?
What's changed?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.904
Who got to you?

31:02.948 --> 31:04.950
Hello.
Was it him?

31:04.993 --> 31:06.908
It was you.
This is all your fault.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.476
Yes, I'm sure it is. Sorry,
what are we talking about?

31:09.519 --> 31:13.306
Amy's decided to pay Brad back
by seducing Tommy Harte.

31:13.349 --> 31:16.265
Tommy? Isn't he a
little young for you?

31:16.309 --> 31:19.616
What is he, 17?He's 18 and mature for his age.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.490
But that's beside the point.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.926
You made a promise,
young lady,

31:24.970 --> 31:27.276
to Brad, to us,
and to the Biltmore Hotel.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.539
Oh, you're one
to talk about promises.

31:29.583 --> 31:32.151
You divorced Daddy,
the guy after him,

31:32.194 --> 31:33.848
and now with Karl sleeping

31:33.892 --> 31:36.024
in the guest room, I'm assuming
he's on his way out as well.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.505
Look.

31:38.548 --> 31:40.333
I love Brad,

31:40.376 --> 31:42.335
but I don't know
if I can trust him,

31:42.378 --> 31:44.119
and I don't want to be
another you.

31:45.294 --> 31:47.470
With three husbands by 40.

31:54.477 --> 31:56.871
Your keys are in the freezer.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.960
Go.

31:59.004 --> 32:02.181
A-Amy, Amy.
You're right.

32:02.224 --> 32:06.925
Your mother and I are sorting
through some issues,

32:06.968 --> 32:09.449
and I'm not
a perfect husband,

32:09.492 --> 32:11.146
and maybe Brad
won't be either,

32:11.190 --> 32:13.583
but love
is always a risk,

32:13.627 --> 32:16.891
and I know it's easy to think
this is never going to last,

32:16.935 --> 32:19.502
so why don't I
end it now, but...

32:19.546 --> 32:22.941
the chance for love doesn't
come around every day.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.246
One must think

32:24.290 --> 32:27.597
long and hard before
one casts it aside.

32:29.338 --> 32:31.993
Mm. Tommy's waiting.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.473
Oh, go, go. I...

32:33.516 --> 32:35.954
I hope you have
a nice dinner.

32:43.135 --> 32:47.487
Do you, uh,
think my pretty speech helped?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.969
More than you know.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.276
I need to make a phone call.

33:01.109 --> 33:04.286
Hey, baby.

33:04.330 --> 33:08.247
I'm gonna take Teacup upstairs.
It's nice and quiet up there.

33:08.290 --> 33:10.031
Yeah. She's had a stressful day.

33:10.075 --> 33:12.251
What you did today,

33:12.294 --> 33:14.949
that was the nicest thing
that anyone's ever done for me.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.733
Oh. No big deal.No. It absolutely was.

33:18.431 --> 33:19.606
Ow!
Oh...

33:19.649 --> 33:21.564
Son of a bitch.

33:21.608 --> 33:24.132
Please hide this.
Somewhere he can't find it.

33:24.176 --> 33:26.004
Okay. Thanks.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.440
Come on, Teacup.

33:27.483 --> 33:29.442
Oh, that's a good girl.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.969
It's a good day, huh?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.362
Is it?

33:36.405 --> 33:38.668
I mean, we got the dog back,
didn't we?

33:40.670 --> 33:44.457
All right. I know we might've
broken the law a little bit.

33:45.632 --> 33:47.982
You broke the law, a lot.

33:48.026 --> 33:49.636
And you made me an accomplice.

33:49.679 --> 33:52.508
All right, yeah, but you saw
how happy it made Jade, right?

33:52.552 --> 33:54.728
I think it was worth it.Absolutely,
you're right.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.600
The smile on Jade's face
more than makes up

33:57.644 --> 33:59.994
for the fact
that I could be disbarred.

34:00.038 --> 34:03.476
I'm sorry. I mean,
I had to do something.

34:03.519 --> 34:06.522
No, you didn't.
I had a plan.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.350
Yeah? So did I.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.656
Mine actually worked.

34:09.699 --> 34:11.266
That's not the point.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.181
Oh, no, no, no, no.
The point is that I finally do

34:13.225 --> 34:15.314
something right and you can't
even be happy about it.

34:15.357 --> 34:18.099
What am I supposed
to be happy about?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.014
For the last two years,
I've been pathetic Eli

34:20.058 --> 34:22.016
who-who can't finish
a screenplay,

34:22.060 --> 34:24.018
who can't help pay
the bills. I-I get it.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.020
You're frustrated with me.
Well, guess what?

34:26.064 --> 34:28.109
I'm frustrated with me, too.

34:28.153 --> 34:31.112
Eli, you're not pathetic.No?

34:31.156 --> 34:33.158
'Cause this morning, I couldn't
even defend my own home.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.768
My wife had to come save me.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.378
'Cause I thought he was gonna
beat you to a pulp.

34:36.422 --> 34:37.771
He probably
would have.

34:37.814 --> 34:39.338
But the fact
that you had to step in,

34:39.381 --> 34:41.209
that makes it hurt even worse.

34:43.168 --> 34:45.344
I was just trying to be helpful.I know.

34:45.387 --> 34:46.693
But sometimes, honey,

34:46.736 --> 34:48.695
I just need a fucking win.

34:48.738 --> 34:51.524
Okay? I just want
to feel like a man

34:51.567 --> 34:54.309
and save a dog
and have that be good enough.

34:57.182 --> 34:58.357
You're right.

34:59.575 --> 35:00.794
It was a good day.

35:00.837 --> 35:02.317
Thank you.

35:04.493 --> 35:06.713
I didn't lock the door.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.758
Okay, all right.
Call the police.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.631
Hey.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.198
Look, hey, man,
l-let me just start

35:13.241 --> 35:14.547
by offering my...

35:15.765 --> 35:17.245
TAYLOR:
No!

35:17.289 --> 35:20.553
Get off me, you bitch!

35:20.596 --> 35:23.730
Jade! Jade!

35:29.779 --> 35:31.564
Jade!

35:32.608 --> 35:35.350
Where the fuck is she?

35:56.197 --> 35:58.765
You broke my leg,
you crazy bitch!

35:58.808 --> 36:02.769
Fuck with my family again,
and I'll break the other one.

36:08.905 --> 36:11.386
How's your food?Excellent.

36:11.430 --> 36:13.780
Yours?Yeah, it's-it's really good.

36:13.823 --> 36:15.173
Good.

36:17.262 --> 36:19.612
So you're going
to college in the fall?

36:19.655 --> 36:22.136
Art school.Oh, that's right.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.138
You like to draw.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.705
That's cute.

36:26.749 --> 36:28.490
Yeah.

36:30.275 --> 36:32.190
Oh, what the hell?

36:32.233 --> 36:35.715
Sorry to interrupt your evening.
Hello, Tommy.

36:35.758 --> 36:37.369
Mrs. Grove.

36:37.412 --> 36:38.805
What are you
doing here, Mom?

36:38.848 --> 36:40.372
I need a moment.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.156
For what?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.766
I brought someone.

36:43.810 --> 36:46.682
Brad would like
to talk to you.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.686
I'm in the middle of dinner.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.820
Well, Tommy doesn't
mind. Do you?

36:53.863 --> 36:56.344
No.

37:02.307 --> 37:05.179
Simone...
Don't look at me.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.268
People will see.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.923
Okay.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.620
There's something
I want to say.

37:11.664 --> 37:14.188
Look, I only went out with
Amy to make you jealous.

37:14.232 --> 37:17.844
It was a, it was dumb thing to
do. I was just hurt, you know?

37:17.887 --> 37:20.499
Because I like you so much.

37:20.542 --> 37:24.242
But I was thinking that
if we put a name to what

37:24.285 --> 37:27.419
we've been doing, then I would
know how you felt about me,

37:27.462 --> 37:29.943
but you're not into it,
so I'll-- I will back off.

37:29.986 --> 37:31.684
You can look at me now.

37:41.259 --> 37:44.262
I must really like you a lot
to wear this god-awful thing.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.312
Well.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.749
I guess the wedding's
back on, then.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.752
Oh. Apparently so.

37:56.796 --> 37:59.451
Back to us.
Are you free Friday?

37:59.494 --> 38:01.453
Yes, ma'am.

38:01.496 --> 38:03.803
Don't call me ma'am.

38:03.846 --> 38:07.241
Yes, lover.

38:07.285 --> 38:09.939
Ma'am will be fine.

38:14.553 --> 38:16.946
Thank you again for inviting us.
Everything was lovely.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.992
VIVIAN:
We are so glad you came.

38:19.035 --> 38:21.473
I can't remember the last time
we laughed so hard.

38:21.516 --> 38:23.301
You're an absolute delight.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.695
I hope we see you again
very soon.

38:26.739 --> 38:28.915
Robert, you're a lucky man, son.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.352
Hope you know that.

38:32.397 --> 38:34.399
Yes, sir.

38:35.748 --> 38:37.750
Good night.
VIVIAN:
Good night.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.639
So how did you
figure it out?

39:05.038 --> 39:08.955
Oh, crap. I left a joint
in my pocket, didn't I?

39:09.999 --> 39:11.392
You did.

39:11.436 --> 39:13.916
You absolutely did.

39:13.960 --> 39:16.441
I knew something was up.

39:16.484 --> 39:18.573
You've been acting
strangely for weeks.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.317
So why did you smoke it?

39:23.361 --> 39:26.015
To get back at me?

39:28.714 --> 39:30.977
Well...

39:31.020 --> 39:33.371
I don't blame you.

39:34.372 --> 39:36.374
I'm sorry.

39:40.726 --> 39:43.772
My walk on the wild side
is over.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.383
Won't happen again.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.877
I have one question.What's that?

40:01.921 --> 40:04.053
Why did you want
to try marijuana?

40:08.884 --> 40:11.452
I thought it would be fun
to break the rules.

40:12.540 --> 40:14.542
Does that sound stupid?

40:16.152 --> 40:18.024
Not at all.

40:18.067 --> 40:23.029
My life feels like one of those
stupid swan napkins.

40:23.072 --> 40:26.859
It's rigid, it's all tight folds
and sharp edges.

40:26.902 --> 40:30.384
And people admire it,
but it takes

40:30.428 --> 40:33.387
so much work.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.391
And it's goddamned exhausting.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.914
Course it is.

40:40.916 --> 40:44.093
We've forgotten to find time
in our life for joy.

40:44.137 --> 40:45.878
Joy?

40:45.921 --> 40:48.489
Hell, I'd settle
for a few laughs now and then.

40:48.533 --> 40:52.493
I would love to hear you
laugh again.

40:52.537 --> 40:55.453
I'd break every rule
in the book for that.

40:57.585 --> 40:58.978
I'm starting to realize

40:59.021 --> 41:00.980
you're not the good little girl
I thought you were.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.157
No, sir.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.202
I'm a rebel.

41:07.595 --> 41:11.120
Okay. Okay.

41:12.600 --> 41:16.082
We've got to do
something, tonight.

41:16.125 --> 41:19.477
Something... crazy!

41:20.695 --> 41:22.784
Crazy and hilarious.

41:22.828 --> 41:25.004
But what? I mean...
what can we do? What?

41:25.047 --> 41:28.529
: I'm actually
getting excited.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.582
Rob...

41:43.501 --> 41:45.067
We're being too loud.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.200
I thought
you were a rebel.

41:47.243 --> 41:49.115
You're right.

41:55.034 --> 41:57.689
CORONER: If you visit your local morgue,

41:57.732 --> 42:00.518
you'll find the bodies
of good people

42:00.561 --> 42:02.998
who made bad choices.

42:06.785 --> 42:11.485
Some engaged
in reckless love affairs.

42:11.529 --> 42:16.490
Some invited violent strangers
into their home.

42:16.534 --> 42:18.753
And some kept dark secrets

42:18.797 --> 42:22.627
from those they loved.

42:22.670 --> 42:25.064
Yes, it's choices like these

42:25.107 --> 42:28.502
that lead to death.

42:28.546 --> 42:32.550
And more importantly, murder.
