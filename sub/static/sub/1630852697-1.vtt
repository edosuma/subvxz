WEBVTT

03:35.983 --> 03:37.051
Yo.

03:38.485 --> 03:39.587
Be good, Clean.

03:40.420 --> 03:41.455
I'm workin' on it.

03:42.724 --> 03:44.125
<i>There were 25 victims...</i>

03:45.392 --> 03:48.529
<i>I'm still lookin' for answers.</i>

03:48.563 --> 03:51.264
<i>I just don't know
the questions anymore.</i>

03:53.300 --> 03:55.703
<i>I just know there's
too much out there.</i>

03:59.807 --> 04:01.374
<i>Sea of filth.</i>

04:03.978 --> 04:06.279
<i>An endless onslaught
of ugliness.</i>

04:07.280 --> 04:08.315
<i>Blight</i>

04:09.117 --> 04:10.151
<i>Plastic.</i>

04:15.857 --> 04:18.793
<i>Cheap shit cloggin' up
our minds.</i>

04:18.826 --> 04:20.728
<i>Cloggin' up the drains,</i>

04:20.762 --> 04:23.798
<i>poisoning our water,
turning us to shit.</i>

04:26.501 --> 04:27.935
<i>Where does it all go?</i>

04:30.705 --> 04:32.740
<i>I've got blood on my hands.</i>

04:34.307 --> 04:36.144
<i>I'm stained.</i>

04:36.177 --> 04:37.178
<i>I'm dirty.</i>

04:42.382 --> 04:44.085
<i>No matter how hard I try,</i>

04:45.119 --> 04:46.854
<i>I can't wash away the past.</i>

05:22.290 --> 05:23.356
Come here.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.871
Travis.

05:37.872 --> 05:39.006
Addict.

05:40.041 --> 05:41.876
You know,
I got hurt serving.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.645
They gave me some pills.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.048
I just kept on taking 'em

05:47.148 --> 05:50.151
'til I couldn't think about
nothin' else.

05:51.552 --> 05:54.021
And, uh, one day,
they turned off the tap.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.357
Got so sick I...

05:57.825 --> 05:59.492
My legs wouldn't straighten out.

06:01.494 --> 06:02.964
But the physical was nothin'

06:02.997 --> 06:05.066
compared to what was
goin' on up here.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.868
<i>A good dose is hard to cop.</i>

06:06.901 --> 06:10.571
Streets were flooded
with that good, good dope, so...

06:10.605 --> 06:14.842
<i>The rush of violence
is better than dope.</i>

06:14.876 --> 06:17.912
<i>Better than blow.
Better than base.</i>

06:18.779 --> 06:22.350
<i>Meth. Crack.</i>

06:22.382 --> 06:25.953
<i>If you're lucky, it'll let you
come down this way.</i>

06:26.854 --> 06:30.024
It's about cleaning up
my side of the street.

06:31.391 --> 06:32.593
And lettin' it go.

06:33.928 --> 06:37.965
So I can be of
maximum usefulness

06:37.999 --> 06:39.600
where my feet are.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.070
Right under me.

06:43.271 --> 06:45.072
Here. Now.

06:59.854 --> 07:02.189
<i>What is it that
makes us return to</i>

07:02.223 --> 07:04.659
<i>that empty place we
keep going back to?</i>

07:08.062 --> 07:10.331
<i>The beaten dog
that needs his owner.</i>

07:12.900 --> 07:14.902
<i>The jilted lover
full of hope.</i>

07:22.610 --> 07:23.844
<i>A failed father...</i>

07:26.314 --> 07:27.915
<i>who failed his child.</i>

07:52.873 --> 07:56.143
<i>Many of these animals
are almost out of time.</i>

08:22.937 --> 08:24.238
- Hey.
- Hey, neighbor.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.040
You're grandma
missed the meeting.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.808
Figured you might need lunch.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.010
You know people
are gonna start saying

08:29.043 --> 08:30.144
you're my dad.

08:30.444 --> 08:31.712
Let me guess.

08:32.446 --> 08:33.681
It's good for you.

08:34.515 --> 08:35.983
Ever think about eating fish
once in a while?

08:36.017 --> 08:37.985
- Nah.
- Just mix it up a little.

08:38.853 --> 08:40.187
Fish is dirty.

08:40.855 --> 08:42.957
- You don't like it, I can stop bringing it.
- No, no. Hold on.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.492
I got something.

08:47.862 --> 08:50.264
Used to make these for
my parents before the accident.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.004
That's for me?

08:59.907 --> 09:01.042
It's a gratitude bracelet.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.686
Go on, now,
you're gonna miss the bus.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.221
Bye.

09:16.223 --> 09:17.792
Hold up, please,
I'm coming.

09:29.538 --> 09:31.305
- Shit.
- Yo.

09:31.338 --> 09:32.940
It's cold out there,
motherfucker, huh?

09:33.207 --> 09:34.442
Yeah.

09:35.609 --> 09:36.844
You know, man,

09:36.877 --> 09:39.013
I can set my
motherfuckin' clocks on you.

09:40.848 --> 09:41.916
What you got here today?

09:44.819 --> 09:46.120
Oh, shit.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.057
Fuckin' Electrolux 30. Damn.

09:50.458 --> 09:51.892
I ain't seen one of these
in years.

09:51.926 --> 09:54.328
Yeah. I rebuilt
the cord winder,

09:54.361 --> 09:57.098
I put new hoses, another plug.
You can check it out.

09:57.131 --> 09:59.333
No, you say it's proper,
it's proper, man.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.369
I'll give you
45 bucks for it.

10:02.403 --> 10:03.471
All right.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.741
- Thanks.
- My man.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.843
Yeah.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.682
Shit, you think
I don't know that?

10:14.715 --> 10:15.716
Yeah, I know that.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.218
Of course.

10:17.251 --> 10:18.786
Hey, my man, let me see
the one with the pistol grip.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.122
Motherfucker, if you can't see
what's goin' on,

10:21.155 --> 10:22.423
you must have
a stye on your eye, nigga,

10:22.456 --> 10:23.624
I don't know
what you got goin' on.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.826
Let me get that one
right there.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.261
This one?

10:27.294 --> 10:28.629
Nah, nah, nah,
not that one, man,

10:28.662 --> 10:30.030
the one with the pistol grip,
the pistol grip.

10:41.510 --> 10:43.911
Nah, nah, nah, wait right
there, I'm comin' right now.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.946
- It's 300.
- 300?

10:46.581 --> 10:48.015
It says 250 on the sticker.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.266
- Hey, man.
- What up? Something's up.

11:05.299 --> 11:06.367
- How's it goin'?
- Good.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.235
What do you got for seconds?

11:08.269 --> 11:09.470
Uh...

11:09.937 --> 11:11.005
three today.

11:13.274 --> 11:14.341
Ugly as shit.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.044
Maybe you can give 'em
a second life.

11:17.646 --> 11:18.712
That'll work.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.017
Half off for public service.

11:24.385 --> 11:25.886
Nice of you.

11:25.920 --> 11:26.987
Where's my doughnut?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.390
I just ate it.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.159
I'll get you one next time.

11:33.194 --> 11:34.228
I promise.

12:45.766 --> 12:46.834
Hey.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.103
Let me guess.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.139
Bye.

12:57.579 --> 12:59.780
I'll meet you
right here, girl.

13:00.414 --> 13:01.782
Gotta get the bus.

13:08.222 --> 13:14.428
<i>♪ Ora pro nobis ♪</i>

13:15.697 --> 13:22.604
<i>♪ Nobis peccatoribus ♪</i>

13:23.538 --> 13:24.805
<i>♪ Nunc... ♪</i>

14:24.231 --> 14:25.700
Where are your feet?

14:25.734 --> 14:27.602
Under me.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.203
What you say?

14:32.906 --> 14:35.710
Come on, man, I said
right here, under me.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.878
It is my job to remind you...

14:38.646 --> 14:40.582
that choosing not to talk...

14:41.081 --> 14:42.617
is still choosing.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.452
That's on you.

14:50.224 --> 14:51.925
We do the work.

14:52.393 --> 14:53.394
And that's it.

14:53.427 --> 14:55.462
Most guys I sponsor,

14:55.496 --> 14:58.031
they got a hard time
doin' work.

14:58.399 --> 15:00.167
Don't want to see
what they did,

15:00.200 --> 15:01.902
don't want to take care of it.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.939
They just want to leave
the mess that they made.

15:06.907 --> 15:09.209
Sweep it up under the carpet...

15:09.611 --> 15:11.378
And hope that it goes away.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.753
But you...

15:19.052 --> 15:21.556
you got a different
sort of malady.

15:22.724 --> 15:24.626
Yeah, it ain't the work.

15:25.225 --> 15:26.427
That's the problem.

15:28.295 --> 15:29.631
It's the lettin' go.

15:32.099 --> 15:34.234
Some things
you can never clean up

15:34.268 --> 15:36.069
no matter how hard you try.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.409
What happens then?

15:43.377 --> 15:45.613
Well, you find a way...

15:46.079 --> 15:47.448
to make peace with them.

15:48.883 --> 15:51.185
Or they make war with you.

16:01.896 --> 16:04.031
<i>You must trust in the plan.</i>

16:04.064 --> 16:06.133
<i>Be a warrior of the lord.</i>

16:06.166 --> 16:08.101
<i>Can you?</i>

16:08.135 --> 16:09.303
<i>Then join us in
this commitment.</i>

16:09.336 --> 16:10.304
<i>Shout it out.</i>

16:13.440 --> 16:15.877
<i>I'm a warrior in service of
a powerful god.</i>

16:15.910 --> 16:18.713
<i>Here I am, Jesus...</i>

16:18.746 --> 16:20.981
There's my boy.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.060
<i>Here I am.</i>

16:33.093 --> 16:35.797
<i>And I will stand for the
redemption of everything.</i>

16:41.703 --> 16:43.136
Fuckin' embarrassing.

16:46.674 --> 16:48.643
Want me to get him?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.320
Let him get it
out of his system.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.341
- Yo!
- Yo!

17:21.375 --> 17:23.443
<i>...shot in
front of a convenience store</i>

17:23.477 --> 17:26.480
<i>when police responded to
reports of a man selling CDs</i>

17:26.514 --> 17:27.782
<i>in front of the store.
Now reportedly...</i>

17:27.815 --> 17:29.383
Oh, hang on.

17:29.416 --> 17:30.852
<i>He'd been shot at...</i>

17:30.885 --> 17:33.420
New cuts. Gotta open up
your route a bit.

17:34.889 --> 17:36.758
Sorry, boss.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.793
<i>...initial reports from police.
They suggested that...</i>

17:39.159 --> 17:40.260
All good.

17:42.597 --> 17:45.399
<i>...he was actually
running away...</i>

21:36.798 --> 21:37.999
Hey.

21:38.966 --> 21:40.201
What's up?
No school?

21:40.500 --> 21:42.637
- The bus didn't come.
- Didn't come?

21:43.104 --> 21:44.739
They said service cuts.

21:44.772 --> 21:46.040
Stopped running it to
the neighborhood.

21:48.075 --> 21:49.476
Your grandma can't take you?

21:50.111 --> 21:51.279
Car's broken.

21:51.779 --> 21:52.880
But it's fine.
I can walk.

21:53.848 --> 21:54.949
You can walk, huh?

22:11.966 --> 22:13.034
You miss people?

22:14.969 --> 22:16.037
What?

22:16.971 --> 22:18.405
I mean,
I always see you alone.

22:18.438 --> 22:20.208
Just wonder if you miss
being around people.

22:21.776 --> 22:23.077
I am around people.

22:24.812 --> 22:26.314
Just...

22:26.346 --> 22:28.015
seems like you wouldn't
be alone, that's all.

22:28.049 --> 22:29.884
Like you'd have a girl
or whatever, all that.

22:31.652 --> 22:34.255
Nah. I ain't really good
at all that.

22:37.892 --> 22:38.993
Yeah.

22:53.975 --> 22:55.309
Catch y'all on
another level, though,

22:55.343 --> 22:57.545
yo, ya'll stay up,
be safe, y'all.

22:57.578 --> 22:58.846
I love y'all niggas, man.

22:58.880 --> 23:00.380
Catch y'all when I get home.

23:05.720 --> 23:06.787
You're late.

23:07.588 --> 23:08.856
Yeah, my fault.

23:09.557 --> 23:10.758
We got work.

23:12.326 --> 23:13.628
You're on the clock.

23:17.430 --> 23:20.034
Maybe I don't feel like smellin'
like fuckin' fish tonight.

23:23.371 --> 23:25.106
That's the smell of success.

23:27.708 --> 23:28.876
What do you got,
one left?

23:28.910 --> 23:29.944
Yeah.

23:30.044 --> 23:31.112
- I got it.
- All right.

23:48.863 --> 23:49.864
Twelve.

23:52.266 --> 23:53.401
We're short five.

23:54.936 --> 23:57.939
- Fuckin' Chinks.
- Yeah, fuckin' Chinese.

23:58.139 --> 23:59.907
Five on 200 ain't shit.

24:00.775 --> 24:01.976
No?

24:02.944 --> 24:04.845
Ain't shit.

24:15.957 --> 24:19.527
Your grandfather,
Michael Sr., used to say,

24:20.460 --> 24:22.462
"You let the small things slide,

24:23.597 --> 24:26.167
you'll be failure."

24:32.940 --> 24:34.709
Okay, Dad.

24:39.747 --> 24:41.382
Okay.

24:43.985 --> 24:45.319
Put Mikey to work.

25:31.465 --> 25:33.367
They stopped runnin' her bus.

25:33.701 --> 25:35.269
She's not your daughter.

25:36.971 --> 25:38.539
Don't get it confused.

25:40.041 --> 25:42.243
You know, we don't need anyone
to save her.

25:44.879 --> 25:46.447
I'm just tryin' to
save myself.

25:52.586 --> 25:53.888
This place.

25:55.723 --> 25:59.794
There used to be families in
every house on this street.

26:03.664 --> 26:05.866
You could hear their kids
laughin' all the time.

26:09.504 --> 26:10.704
It was like music.

26:25.186 --> 26:27.888
I saw you paintin' those
abandoned buildings.

26:28.689 --> 26:30.091
You're a good man.

26:34.962 --> 26:36.263
No, ma'am.

26:42.703 --> 26:45.406
<i>I remember I got a
bike like that for my daughter.</i>

26:45.439 --> 26:47.374
<i>She was wild, man,
she made me take</i>

26:47.408 --> 26:49.844
the training wheels off
after a week.

26:50.611 --> 26:51.912
I was like,
"You sure, baby?'

26:51.946 --> 26:54.115
She said, "You only got
two wheels, Daddy.

26:54.148 --> 26:56.617
You only got two wheels."
I said...

26:56.650 --> 26:58.886
"Okay."

26:58.919 --> 27:01.755
I'm pullin' out bits of street
from her knees.

27:03.090 --> 27:06.227
Puttin' Band-Aids on 'em
every night and, like,

27:06.260 --> 27:08.095
cleanin' the blood
off her school clothes, just...

27:12.233 --> 27:14.001
She didn't care,
she just loved it.

27:24.579 --> 27:26.280
Yeah, I can see her ridin'.

27:30.718 --> 27:33.020
<i>She was ridin' all wild with
her hair behind her.</i>

27:34.989 --> 27:36.957
<i>This little toothless smile
on her.</i>

27:43.697 --> 27:46.033
She said, "I want to ride
like you, Daddy."

28:11.859 --> 28:13.194
You did good.

28:21.835 --> 28:23.837
Jesus said,

28:23.871 --> 28:25.574
"You give them
something to eat."

28:27.241 --> 28:28.742
They said to him,

28:29.043 --> 28:32.112
"We have only five loaves here
and two fish."

28:33.582 --> 28:36.183
And he said,
"Bring them here to me."

28:39.554 --> 28:42.389
<i>Then he ordered the crowds
to sit down on the grass.</i>

28:44.693 --> 28:47.127
<i>And taking the five loaves
and the two fish...</i>

28:48.963 --> 28:50.231
<i>he looked up to heaven...</i>

28:52.066 --> 28:53.602
<i>and he blessed and broke</i>

28:53.635 --> 28:55.570
<i>and gave the loaves to
the disciples.</i>

28:57.304 --> 29:00.808
<i>And they all ate
and were satisfied.</i>

29:03.410 --> 29:06.681
<i>And they took up
12 baskets full...</i>

29:06.715 --> 29:08.550
<i>with the broken pieces
leftover.</i>

29:09.783 --> 29:11.452
<i>And those who ate...</i>

29:12.687 --> 29:14.788
<i>were about 5,000 men...</i>

29:16.691 --> 29:18.359
<i>besides women and children.</i>

29:20.094 --> 29:22.631
This is the gospel of our lord
Jesus Christ.

29:22.863 --> 29:24.832
Thanks be to God.

29:47.722 --> 29:48.956
Get those boxes over here.

29:48.989 --> 29:50.692
Marcus,
quit fuckin' around.

29:55.296 --> 29:56.797
See what we got.

30:03.270 --> 30:04.673
Michael.

30:10.010 --> 30:11.979
My father, Michael Sr.,

30:13.347 --> 30:15.382
he used to make me
clean these things.

30:16.483 --> 30:18.319
Nastiest job in the shop.

30:21.656 --> 30:24.258
Fuckin' guts rot

30:24.291 --> 30:25.859
as soon as they hit the air.

30:28.763 --> 30:30.297
I used to hate that smell.

30:36.638 --> 30:37.706
I got used to it.

30:51.285 --> 30:52.353
Watch.

31:37.364 --> 31:38.700
Short five.

31:39.366 --> 31:40.869
Check your scales.

31:51.679 --> 31:53.581
Now clean the fuckin' squid.

33:10.123 --> 33:11.860
Sorry about the smell.

33:16.296 --> 33:17.498
I'm used to it.

33:18.967 --> 33:21.134
They got you out here
all alone, huh?

33:24.506 --> 33:25.573
Cuts.

33:27.341 --> 33:28.408
Here.

33:29.944 --> 33:31.078
I quit.

33:36.049 --> 33:38.920
Gotta do everything ourselves
these days, huh?

33:39.554 --> 33:41.221
Oh. Hm...

33:43.658 --> 33:44.726
For your trouble.

33:46.059 --> 33:47.194
I'm good.

33:50.999 --> 33:52.332
Be safe.

33:52.634 --> 33:54.101
You too.

34:17.659 --> 34:18.793
Fuck.

35:30.064 --> 35:31.699
Leave me alone, man.

36:41.135 --> 36:43.104
What you lookin' at?

36:48.643 --> 36:52.547
I said you got
a motherfuckin' eye problem?

38:18.298 --> 38:19.466
Hi, baby.

38:26.274 --> 38:27.975
...could cause
some slight nausea

38:28.009 --> 38:29.277
but you'll get used to it
quickly.

38:29.610 --> 38:32.180
Barely any risk of dependence
with the time release.

38:33.114 --> 38:34.882
Clinic will refill

38:34.916 --> 38:36.851
as long as pain persists.

38:39.287 --> 38:40.387
I don't want that.

38:42.322 --> 38:44.625
I don't know what kind of shit
you put yourself through,

38:45.293 --> 38:47.327
but it's a miracle
you can even walk.

38:47.862 --> 38:49.096
And I'm talking about
your injuries

38:49.130 --> 38:50.298
before this incident.

38:52.600 --> 38:54.168
Take the meds.

38:55.937 --> 38:58.539
Yeah. I'm good, thanks.

39:03.611 --> 39:05.478
- Boss...
- I promise you...

39:05.513 --> 39:08.015
The lawyers.
You gotta take a few weeks.

39:08.049 --> 39:09.416
Liabilities, man.

39:12.019 --> 39:13.921
- Call when you can drive.
- I can drive, man.

39:16.557 --> 39:18.259
They're not gonna
let me work.

39:24.732 --> 39:26.601
Talk about liabilities.

39:28.636 --> 39:29.871
Lawyers.

39:31.639 --> 39:33.007
What do I do?

39:36.677 --> 39:37.745
I don't know.

39:38.411 --> 39:40.447
Maybe just, uh...

39:40.548 --> 39:42.016
walk a while.

39:50.057 --> 39:51.125
Hey.

39:52.159 --> 39:53.194
Hey.

39:53.227 --> 39:55.229
What's goin' on?
It's cold.

39:56.097 --> 39:57.231
Grandma's out.

39:57.265 --> 39:58.733
I left my key inside.

40:03.871 --> 40:05.206
You hungry?

40:06.340 --> 40:07.608
Chicken?

40:10.077 --> 40:11.478
Chicken. Yeah.

40:25.626 --> 40:27.061
I thought something bad
might have happened.

40:27.094 --> 40:28.229
Huh?

40:31.899 --> 40:33.734
I said, I thought something bad
might have happened.

40:35.636 --> 40:36.971
No, I'm good.

40:39.974 --> 40:41.409
Yeah, I'm good.

40:43.144 --> 40:44.779
- You done?
- Mm.

40:49.250 --> 40:51.185
I got it.

41:02.563 --> 41:03.864
How's school?

41:04.632 --> 41:05.700
Boring.

41:06.499 --> 41:07.668
Boring?

41:08.336 --> 41:09.637
Know what's boring?

41:11.138 --> 41:13.708
Not knowing how to read.
That's what's boring.

41:18.446 --> 41:19.847
I can read.

41:41.302 --> 41:42.536
Don't touch that.

41:51.012 --> 41:53.147
<i>Fentanyl is now
the most common drug</i>

41:53.180 --> 41:56.017
<i>involved in drug overdoses
in the United States.</i>

42:26.847 --> 42:28.916
- <i>He scores!</i>
- Yes.

42:30.317 --> 42:32.286
Hey.

42:32.319 --> 42:33.621
Your team's winning.

42:35.156 --> 42:36.891
Rather be back in the pen...

42:36.924 --> 42:38.192
I'm talkin' to you.

42:38.759 --> 42:40.995
Rather be with
my friends on the street...

42:41.028 --> 42:43.164
- Mikey.
- Than these old ass parents,

42:43.197 --> 42:44.698
with my boys is the grillest,

42:44.732 --> 42:47.101
the streets is my family,
man, I know you can feel it.

42:49.904 --> 42:52.139
You think those niggers
are your family?

42:53.107 --> 42:56.143
The only reason your boys
keep a punk like you around

42:56.177 --> 42:59.447
is 'cause they know your father
is the motherfuckin' king!

42:59.613 --> 43:01.248
Yeah, well, fuck you!

43:01.749 --> 43:03.951
Yeah? You want to stab me?

43:04.418 --> 43:05.886
Go on, little prince.

43:05.920 --> 43:08.722
Go ahead.
Make yourself a man.

43:08.756 --> 43:09.957
Man, fuck this shit!

43:10.525 --> 43:12.126
I'm done,
this shit is dead!

43:13.127 --> 43:14.662
Oh.

43:15.229 --> 43:16.630
Okay, Kanye.

43:21.102 --> 43:24.506
Look in the fuckin' mirror!

43:50.397 --> 43:51.899
I don't know
this little freak.

43:51.932 --> 43:55.035
What you need?

43:57.404 --> 43:59.173
Gettin' late.

44:00.474 --> 44:01.775
You ain't my father.

44:02.611 --> 44:03.744
You're a woman now.

44:03.777 --> 44:05.679
Your grandma's gonna worry.

44:06.615 --> 44:08.115
Hey, yo, you deaf,
motherfucker?

44:09.650 --> 44:10.818
Get the fuck outta here.

44:12.086 --> 44:14.054
Trippin', dawg.
Seriously, dawg?

44:14.523 --> 44:17.592
She said she was busy.
What's up?

44:27.001 --> 44:29.136
Yo, Oz!

44:39.046 --> 44:41.415
There he is,
my main motherfucker.

44:41.849 --> 44:43.484
What's up, baby?

44:43.518 --> 44:45.219
On schedule as usual.

44:47.221 --> 44:49.890
- What you got in here now?
- Yeah, I got a... an amp.

44:51.392 --> 44:53.027
- Ooh, shit.
- Yeah.

44:53.360 --> 44:55.196
It's an Alpine 450.

44:55.996 --> 44:57.666
This shit used to bump
back in the day.

44:57.698 --> 45:00.000
Had the 18 inch woofers,
like, bump, ba-bump,

45:00.034 --> 45:01.869
ba-bump, ba-bump.
You know what I mean?

45:02.469 --> 45:04.004
Yeah, I like shit like this.

45:05.574 --> 45:07.875
Blowin' all the hinges off
the motherfuckin' car.

45:18.752 --> 45:20.054
Yo, Clean.

45:24.526 --> 45:26.126
You got some more work
to do, man.

45:29.598 --> 45:30.898
Demons.

45:32.733 --> 45:34.034
Demons, man.

45:35.035 --> 45:36.837
I ain't talkin' about the ones
with horns and shit

45:36.870 --> 45:38.739
'cause them motherfuckers
don't scare me.

45:39.907 --> 45:42.544
Talkin' about the ones that
show up at four in the morning.

45:44.411 --> 45:45.946
You know,
the ones you can't see.

45:46.447 --> 45:47.616
But they're there.

45:48.949 --> 45:50.619
They sittin' on the edge of
your bed.

45:52.119 --> 45:53.988
You know, they sittin' there
and they talkin' to you.

45:55.055 --> 45:56.490
Tellin' you you ain't shit.

45:59.026 --> 46:00.794
Tellin' you that you're
worse than shit.

46:01.795 --> 46:03.565
Tellin' you that you can't be
nothin', man,

46:03.598 --> 46:05.165
that you can't do nothin'.

46:05.199 --> 46:07.636
Can't be of no type of service
to anybody you care about.

46:10.137 --> 46:12.106
Except bring everybody
the same pain

46:12.139 --> 46:14.141
you brought anybody that
gave a fuck about you.

46:15.075 --> 46:16.944
Yeah, those the demons
I'm talkin' about.

46:18.212 --> 46:19.413
Them motherfuckers.

46:33.961 --> 46:35.029
Yo, I know you.

46:38.232 --> 46:40.968
- I don't think so.
- Nah, I never forget a face.

46:41.268 --> 46:42.637
You look real familiar.

46:44.506 --> 46:45.607
No.

46:50.277 --> 46:51.979
You the guy
with the rich.

47:03.057 --> 47:05.359
Father, I'm trying
to show him principles.

47:06.860 --> 47:08.362
Hard work, discipline.

47:09.463 --> 47:10.532
Family.

47:13.367 --> 47:16.170
All I ever wanted was to teach
my son to be a man.

47:20.775 --> 47:22.343
But I'm failing him, Father.

47:26.347 --> 47:27.414
I'm failing.

47:27.881 --> 47:29.983
It is the lot of
every father

47:30.552 --> 47:32.986
to worry about his children.

47:34.988 --> 47:37.759
If God can redeem
the worst among us,

47:39.126 --> 47:41.830
surely he will show you and
your boy the right path.

47:44.131 --> 47:45.199
Persevere.

52:11.966 --> 52:14.669
What's up?
We closed.

52:17.005 --> 52:18.606
Motherfucker,
I said we closed.

52:27.115 --> 52:28.549
I'm gonna have to
open you up.

52:28.783 --> 52:29.851
What?

54:18.192 --> 54:19.827
He'll make a full recovery.

54:21.428 --> 54:24.331
But if he doesn't get to
a surgeon now,

54:24.364 --> 54:28.435
the cosmetic complications
could be substantial.

54:32.640 --> 54:34.642
He may never
speak properly again.

54:37.410 --> 54:38.946
He needs a real doctor.

54:51.893 --> 54:52.960
Leave it.

54:54.262 --> 54:55.495
Let him remember.

55:08.943 --> 55:11.279
The guy with the wrench lives
up the street from that place.

55:11.444 --> 55:14.182
Been a resident eight years.
Nothin' on him before that.

55:14.447 --> 55:15.650
He's a trash man.

55:18.653 --> 55:19.887
Trash man.

55:20.788 --> 55:22.190
Looks like they left
in a hurry.

55:23.124 --> 55:25.193
My people are already
looking for make and plate.

55:26.861 --> 55:27.962
It's our show.

55:29.931 --> 55:32.233
Kill the girl and
the old lady first.

55:32.266 --> 55:33.534
So he can see.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.007
Make it messy.

56:02.997 --> 56:04.397
It's not your fault.

56:08.736 --> 56:09.837
Fuck.

56:13.473 --> 56:14.942
Turn around. Eyes ahead.

56:27.387 --> 56:28.455
Shit.

57:20.207 --> 57:21.842
He's not calling it in.

57:22.877 --> 57:24.512
Shit.

57:26.414 --> 57:28.249
What are you...
What are you doing?

57:29.150 --> 57:30.351
He's with them.

58:17.598 --> 58:19.066
We're gonna need a new car.

58:26.540 --> 58:27.808
Boss.

58:30.011 --> 58:31.245
We almost had him.

58:32.346 --> 58:34.048
At least we know he's
up north.

58:34.682 --> 58:36.250
We got eyes everywhere now.

58:39.053 --> 58:40.755
Seven Hector's crew.

58:41.555 --> 58:42.757
They'll call when it's done.

59:02.009 --> 59:03.411
I need the bathroom.

59:04.845 --> 59:07.448
- You're gonna have to wait.
- No, I need to go.

59:12.053 --> 59:13.254
I'll take her.

59:16.757 --> 59:19.427
I'll be out front in
three minutes. Okay?

59:45.086 --> 59:46.587
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

59:53.060 --> 59:54.428
Shit.

1:00:14.715 --> 1:00:16.518
All right, you see that?

1:00:16.551 --> 1:00:18.719
Try that, motherfucker!

1:02:39.093 --> 1:02:40.562
Shit.

1:02:45.199 --> 1:02:46.400
Dianda. Door.

1:04:23.030 --> 1:04:24.365
I'm sorry.

1:04:38.245 --> 1:04:39.213
Angel?

1:05:36.970 --> 1:05:38.071
Fuck.

1:05:39.039 --> 1:05:40.107
Baby.

1:05:47.114 --> 1:05:48.516
Why?

1:05:50.451 --> 1:05:51.619
Hey.

1:05:56.658 --> 1:05:59.960
Oh, no, no, no, baby.
Wake up.

1:06:00.961 --> 1:06:02.864
Baby, wake up.

1:06:14.676 --> 1:06:16.009
Oh, God.

1:06:24.853 --> 1:06:26.153
I'm sorry.

1:06:37.599 --> 1:06:39.066
It's not your fault.

1:06:48.008 --> 1:06:49.978
Please, God, no.

1:06:55.984 --> 1:06:57.050
Oh, God.

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:01.689
Oh, God.

1:07:02.456 --> 1:07:03.691
God!

1:07:48.168 --> 1:07:50.038
We can never go home.

1:07:53.942 --> 1:07:55.242
You did this.

1:08:00.414 --> 1:08:01.616
I'm gonna make it right.

1:08:08.890 --> 1:08:09.958
Will you come back?

1:08:12.459 --> 1:08:13.561
Yeah.

1:08:19.968 --> 1:08:21.069
Thank you.

1:09:02.677 --> 1:09:04.579
You can go to the cops.

1:09:04.612 --> 1:09:05.847
They're with him.

1:09:06.948 --> 1:09:08.315
Then drive.

1:09:08.516 --> 1:09:10.283
Start again.
All of you.

1:09:18.526 --> 1:09:19.794
They'll find us.

1:09:20.828 --> 1:09:21.829
<i>They'll find them.</i>

1:09:26.668 --> 1:09:28.036
This is for the girl.

1:09:29.336 --> 1:09:31.506
<i>You can
give it to her yourself.</i>

1:09:34.609 --> 1:09:36.044
<i>It won't stop.</i>

1:09:37.712 --> 1:09:39.013
<i>How do you know?</i>

1:09:40.480 --> 1:09:42.050
Because I wouldn't.

1:09:48.690 --> 1:09:50.190
<i>You said find
a way to make peace.</i>

1:09:54.394 --> 1:09:55.563
I did.

1:10:07.675 --> 1:10:10.611
There he is.
One-man Amazon.

1:10:14.381 --> 1:10:15.883
What you got in the bag for me?

1:10:18.686 --> 1:10:20.088
I'm buying today.

1:10:21.589 --> 1:10:22.724
Okay.

1:10:25.093 --> 1:10:26.293
What you need?

1:10:30.698 --> 1:10:33.366
- Home protection?
- Hunting.

1:10:36.170 --> 1:10:37.638
Hunting season over, man.

1:10:38.940 --> 1:10:40.074
Not yet.

1:10:43.778 --> 1:10:45.312
I need a carry out.

1:10:46.080 --> 1:10:47.447
You want a carry out?

1:10:48.783 --> 1:10:49.951
Yeah.

1:10:52.887 --> 1:10:54.689
Look, there's no waiting period
for the shotguns...

1:10:54.722 --> 1:10:57.058
Yeah, shotgun. Let me see
the one with the pistol grip.

1:11:00.928 --> 1:11:02.230
That's on layaway.

1:11:02.462 --> 1:11:03.998
But I got somethin' for you.

1:11:08.636 --> 1:11:10.104
This just came in today.

1:11:12.439 --> 1:11:13.674
No numbers.

1:11:14.041 --> 1:11:15.143
And it's cheap.

1:11:18.780 --> 1:11:20.648
That'll kill
a motherfuckin' bear.

1:11:23.918 --> 1:11:25.452
How much for
the flare gun?

1:11:26.120 --> 1:11:27.855
That's on me, man.

1:11:31.259 --> 1:11:32.627
My man.

1:12:13.534 --> 1:12:15.236
You're wearing a hole
in my rug.

1:12:24.011 --> 1:12:25.580
Yeah.

1:12:25.613 --> 1:12:27.281
<i>They're gone.</i>

1:12:27.315 --> 1:12:29.250
<i>You know who's card
you pulled?</i>

1:12:29.283 --> 1:12:31.085
<i>It's Carlo's guy
from Chi Town.</i>

1:12:31.552 --> 1:12:34.055
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

1:12:34.088 --> 1:12:36.757
<i>The one who disappeared.</i>

1:12:36.791 --> 1:12:38.860
<i>You sent me to kill
the grim fuckin' reaper.</i>

1:12:41.963 --> 1:12:43.030
What?

1:12:47.034 --> 1:12:48.202
The trash man...

1:12:50.304 --> 1:12:51.939
wasn't always a trash man.

1:12:58.246 --> 1:12:59.513
Yeah?

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:04.018
Who is this?

1:13:06.587 --> 1:13:08.055
How'd you get this number?

1:13:10.925 --> 1:13:12.425
<i>Same way I got
your address.</i>

1:14:32.740 --> 1:14:33.808
Boom.

1:16:24.519 --> 1:16:26.654
Come here.
Come here.

1:16:31.959 --> 1:16:33.060
My man.

1:16:52.079 --> 1:16:53.681
God has a plan.

1:17:17.905 --> 1:17:19.874
We got cars
blockin' the driveway.

1:17:20.141 --> 1:17:22.209
We got everything inside
and outside covered.

1:17:22.443 --> 1:17:23.944
No one's gettin' through
this shit.

1:17:25.846 --> 1:17:27.214
Hey, boss.

1:17:27.681 --> 1:17:28.849
Yeah, Vic?

1:17:29.650 --> 1:17:31.018
You know,
not for nothin'.

1:17:31.118 --> 1:17:33.654
What kind of guy calls ahead
before doin' a hit?

1:17:35.990 --> 1:17:37.124
A dead one.

1:17:58.679 --> 1:17:59.747
Hey, Clean.

1:18:01.382 --> 1:18:02.816
Some dudes came by
lookin' for you.

1:18:03.717 --> 1:18:04.985
Yeah, I know.

1:18:05.386 --> 1:18:06.754
Ugly motherfuckers.

1:18:07.556 --> 1:18:08.657
You back?

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:11.992
Yeah.

1:18:19.967 --> 1:18:22.036
<i>I never really knew
my father.</i>

1:18:22.069 --> 1:18:23.771
<i>Or what he did.</i>

1:18:23.804 --> 1:18:25.372
<i>But, uh,
I knew he was tough.</i>

1:18:29.511 --> 1:18:32.681
<i>When I was really young,
I saw him die.</i>

1:18:36.450 --> 1:18:38.986
<i>He looked at me.</i>

1:18:39.019 --> 1:18:40.955
<i>He was more surprised
than anything.</i>

1:18:42.957 --> 1:18:44.291
<i>Didn't say goodbye.</i>

1:18:46.994 --> 1:18:48.295
<i>I'll always remember
that look.</i>

1:18:53.300 --> 1:18:55.236
<i>Like he was trying to
teach me a lesson.</i>

1:18:58.839 --> 1:19:00.407
<i>He used to say, uh...</i>

1:19:01.909 --> 1:19:03.712
<i>I'm allergic to death.</i>

1:19:04.646 --> 1:19:05.647
<i>Huh.</i>

1:19:05.680 --> 1:19:07.047
<i>My own, at least.</i>

1:19:09.416 --> 1:19:10.451
<i>Ain't we all.</i>

1:20:10.244 --> 1:20:11.345
To fatherhood.

1:20:14.248 --> 1:20:15.550
Fatherhood.

1:21:04.198 --> 1:21:05.165
<i>Forgive me.</i>

1:21:09.838 --> 1:21:11.872
Take him out!

1:21:16.377 --> 1:21:17.444
Hold!

1:21:18.045 --> 1:21:19.413
Reload.

1:21:25.152 --> 1:21:26.220
He's in the room!

1:21:26.253 --> 1:21:27.888
He's in the fuckin' room!

1:21:28.889 --> 1:21:30.357
Fuck!

1:21:34.428 --> 1:21:35.462
Get him!

1:21:39.233 --> 1:21:40.901
- Come on, get out!
- Kill this motherfucker!

1:21:40.934 --> 1:21:42.202
Just go. Go!

1:21:46.006 --> 1:21:47.107
Boom.

1:22:27.816 --> 1:22:28.982
Stay down.

1:24:06.413 --> 1:24:07.782
He's there.

1:24:09.517 --> 1:24:10.785
All the way down.

1:24:58.231 --> 1:25:02.003
You smash my kid's face
to shit.

1:25:04.072 --> 1:25:08.810
And then you drive
a fuckin' garbage truck

1:25:09.209 --> 1:25:11.378
into my goddamn house!

1:26:44.972 --> 1:26:46.507
There's my boy.

1:28:10.792 --> 1:28:12.459
<i>Time is an eraser.</i>

1:28:13.661 --> 1:28:15.997
<i>It takes away the burn.</i>

1:28:16.030 --> 1:28:17.198
<i>Allows you to heal.</i>

1:28:19.634 --> 1:28:22.703
<i>Forget some of the things that
you're better off forgetting.</i>

1:28:24.872 --> 1:28:27.775
<i>But some things,
some people,</i>

1:28:27.809 --> 1:28:29.210
<i>always stay with you.</i>

1:28:34.314 --> 1:28:35.817
<i>I believe in angels.</i>

1:28:38.052 --> 1:28:40.387
<i>Not the ones with wings
and a halo.</i>

1:28:42.123 --> 1:28:43.825
<i>The ones that don't
look like them.</i>

1:28:46.194 --> 1:28:47.360
Hey, Dianda.

1:28:49.030 --> 1:28:50.463
<i>They're in disguise.</i>

1:29:02.009 --> 1:29:03.343
<i>Sometimes...</i>

1:29:06.346 --> 1:29:08.348
<i>it's hard to tell
who's the saved...</i>

1:29:11.219 --> 1:29:12.485
<i>and who's the savior.</i>

1:32:31.385 --> 1:32:32.953
<i>And the NYPD
is investigating...</i>

1:32:34.221 --> 1:32:35.524
<i>...deadly shooting in Queens.</i>

1:32:39.326 --> 1:32:40.961
<i>Police say
a 27 year old man...</i>

1:32:42.129 --> 1:32:43.431
<i>...was shot in the neck.</i>

1:32:44.799 --> 1:32:46.067
<i>...pronounced dead
at Jamaica Hospital.</i>

1:32:47.101 --> 1:32:48.537
<i>Two other men...</i>

1:32:49.937 --> 1:32:50.905
<i>...were also shot.</i>

1:33:06.020 --> 1:33:07.556
<i>Hello?</i>

1:33:07.588 --> 1:33:09.457
<i>Hey, yo, it's Clean.</i>

1:33:09.490 --> 1:33:11.325
<i>You let 'em know...</i>

1:33:12.326 --> 1:33:13.994
<i>it's done.</i>

1:33:14.028 --> 1:33:15.729
<i>Hey, Papa, it's done.</i>

1:33:17.098 --> 1:33:18.632
<i>All right.</i>

1:33:18.666 --> 1:33:20.234
<i>I will relay the message.</i>
