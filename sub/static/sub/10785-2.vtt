PREVIOUSLY ON  DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:02.834 --> 00:04.500
ME NOT GOING TO FRANCE,

00:04.500 --> 00:06.542
YOU AND ME TALKING DIRTY
IN THE HALLS...

00:06.542 --> 00:07.875
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK

00:07.875 --> 00:09.834
WE'RE MAKING SOME MASSIVE,
MONUMENTAL MISTAKE?

00:09.834 --> 00:11.250
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

00:12.083 --> 00:15.333
OFFICER, PLEASE,
I AM SO SORRY.

00:15.333 --> 00:15.875
I JUST GOT MY LICENSE.

00:15.875 --> 00:17.834
PLEASE BE KIND?

00:17.834 --> 00:18.750
OFFICER PACEY!

00:18.750 --> 00:20.708
YOU LITTLE SCUM.

00:20.708 --> 00:21.583
IT SEEMS A LITTLE SAD.

00:21.583 --> 00:23.750
I WAS THE GIRL
WHOSE SOLE PURPOSE

00:23.750 --> 00:24.750
WAS TO ALLOW YOU TO FIGURE OUT

00:24.750 --> 00:25.917
WHO YOU WERE
REALLY IN LOVE WITH.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.500
Announcer: THE POPEIL
PASTA AND SAUSAGE MAKER,

00:34.500 --> 00:36.000
IT'S TWO MACHINES IN ONE.

00:36.000 --> 00:37.458
NOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER,

00:37.458 --> 00:41.208
YOU CAN MAKE HOMEMADE SAUSAGE
AND HOMEMADE PASTA

00:41.208 --> 00:43.208
AS EASY
AS ONE-TWO-THREE.

00:43.208 --> 00:45.542
TURKEY SAUSAGE,
CHICKEN SAUSAGE,

00:45.542 --> 00:47.250
VEAL OR PORK SAUSAGE,

VENISON
OR ELK SAUSAGE,

00:49.250 --> 00:50.041
SALMON
OR SHRIMP SAUSAGE,

00:50.041 --> 00:51.750
EVEN VEGETABLE
SAUSAGES,

00:51.750 --> 00:53.375
AND DON'T FORGET

00:53.375 --> 00:55.959
GREAT TASTING, FRESH,
HOMEMADE HOT DOGS.

00:55.959 --> 00:59.750
THIS INCREDIBLE INVENTION
ALSO MAKES--

01:01.959 --> 01:03.917
UH...

01:03.917 --> 01:05.959
MOM AND DAD.

01:05.959 --> 01:09.583
HEY, UM...

01:09.583 --> 01:14.667
YOU REMEMBER
JOEY, RIGHT?

02:10.625 --> 02:12.959
Woman: GOOD JOB. YOU PASSED YOUR
DRIVER'S TEST.

02:12.959 --> 02:14.417
GOOD JOB.

02:14.417 --> 02:14.917
GOOD JOB.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.125
GOOD JOB.

02:17.125 --> 02:19.291
MISSED BY ONE POINT.

02:19.291 --> 02:20.625
THAT'S TOO BAD.

02:20.625 --> 02:22.542
WE REALLY NEED ANOTHER
JUVENILE DELINQUENT CHOWDERHEAD

02:22.542 --> 02:23.750
ON THE ROAD.

02:23.750 --> 02:25.291
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T HAVE STUDIED.

02:25.291 --> 02:27.417
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU STUDY?

02:27.417 --> 02:31.083
ONE POINT AWAY FROM ENTERING
THE WORLD OF VEHICULAR FREEDOM.

02:31.083 --> 02:32.250
[SIGHS]

02:32.250 --> 02:34.041
LISTEN, MISS,

02:34.041 --> 02:35.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK
IT'S GOING TO TAKE

02:35.500 --> 02:37.625
TO CHANGE JUST ONE LITTLE ANSWER
ON THIS TEST?

02:37.625 --> 02:38.959
LET'S SAY,
FREE VIDEOS FOR A YEAR?

02:38.959 --> 02:41.708
YOU AREN'T TRYING TO BRIBE ME,
ARE YOU, MR. WITTER?

02:41.708 --> 02:42.792
AH, COME ON, OFFICER.

02:42.792 --> 02:44.125
TOSS ME A BREAK.
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

02:44.125 --> 02:45.625
OH, IT IS? REALLY?

02:45.625 --> 02:46.333
WELL, THEN,
YOU SHOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

02:48.417 --> 02:49.708
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.375
AND BECAUSE BECOMING
SEXUALLY ACTIVE

02:54.375 --> 02:55.792
IS A VERY
SERIOUS BUSINESS,

02:55.792 --> 02:56.834
I THINK THAT IT'S TIME

02:56.834 --> 02:57.875
THAT YOU AND I
TALKED ABOUT IT.

02:57.875 --> 02:59.834
HEY, DAD, WE WERE
JUST MAKING OUT.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.375
DAWSON,
BOY-GIRL SLEEPOVERS

03:01.375 --> 03:02.375
ARE NO LONGER WITHIN
APPROPRIATE BOUNDARIES

03:02.375 --> 03:04.667
NOW, JOEY ISN'T
A LITTLE GIRL ANYMORE,

03:04.667 --> 03:05.917
WHICH YOU SEEM
TO HAVE NOTICED.

03:05.917 --> 03:07.291
THIS IS SO SURREAL
COMING FROM YOU,

03:07.291 --> 03:08.333
OF ALL PEOPLE.

03:08.333 --> 03:09.834
YOU KNOW, I RECENTLY
SAW A REPORT

03:09.834 --> 03:11.000
ON THE STATISTICAL
PORTRAIT

03:11.000 --> 03:12.333
OF ADOLESCENT SEX
AND CONTRACEPTION,

03:12.333 --> 03:13.667
AND THE SEXUALLY
ACTIVE TEEN

03:13.667 --> 03:15.000
WHO DOESN'T
USE CONTRACEPTION

03:15.000 --> 03:16.375
STANDS A 90% CHANCE
OF BECOMING PREGNANT

03:16.375 --> 03:17.458
WITHIN ONE YEAR,

03:17.458 --> 03:18.708
AND OF THAT GROUP,

03:18.708 --> 03:20.083
LESS THAN HALF
CARRY TO FULL TERM.

03:24.458 --> 03:25.834
HI, MRS. LEERY.

03:25.834 --> 03:27.542
OH, JOEY...

03:27.542 --> 03:28.500
GOOD.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.542
HONEY, I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE.

03:30.542 --> 03:32.375
UM, HONEY, COME HERE A SEC.

03:38.250 --> 03:43.667

A TERRIFIC BOOK.

03:43.667 --> 03:46.000
REPRODUCTION AND REPERCUSSION.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.875
IT'S ALL ABOUT PREVENTING
TEEN PREGNANCY,

03:48.875 --> 03:51.375
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING

03:51.375 --> 03:56.041
THAT YOU WOULD LIKE
TO TALK TO ME ABOUT,

03:56.041 --> 03:57.667
ANY SEX QUESTIONS
ABOUT ANYTHING,

03:57.667 --> 03:59.208
YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME TO ME.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.917
HEY, LOOK AT THE TIME.
WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE.

04:00.917 --> 04:02.375
LET'S GO.

04:02.375 --> 04:07.375
REMEMBER, DAWSON,
NO HAT, NO GLOVE.

04:07.375 --> 04:10.166
NO, MITCH, HONEY,
THAT'S "NO GLOVE, NO LOVE."

04:10.166 --> 04:13.250
YEAH, WELL, UH,
YOU GET THE POINT.

04:13.250 --> 04:14.583
UH, JOEY?

04:21.333 --> 04:23.250
OUR BABY'S GROWING UP.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.041
IT SEEMS LIKE
JUST A BLINK AGO

04:25.041 --> 04:27.083
HE WAS COMING HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL,

04:27.083 --> 04:29.625
AND HERE WE ARE,
1000 YEARS LATER--

04:29.625 --> 04:31.500
CLUELESS AS EVER.

04:52.625 --> 04:56.375
AND GOD SAID,
"LET THERE BE LIGHT."

04:58.959 --> 04:59.625
OH, WHAT THE HELL?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.166
OH, DON'T SWEAR, DEAR.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.166
GOD IS LISTENING.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.458
YEAH, WELL, IF HE WERE,

05:04.458 --> 05:06.041
THEN HE'D KNOW
THAT "HELL"

05:06.041 --> 05:07.500
ISN'T CONSIDERED
A SWEAR WORD ANYMORE.

05:07.500 --> 05:09.583
YOU CAN SAY IT ON NETWORK TV,

05:09.583 --> 05:10.917
AND BESIDES,

05:10.917 --> 05:14.041
I'M NOT GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.125
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOU, JENNIFER.

05:15.125 --> 05:16.333

LATELY.

05:16.333 --> 05:18.667

05:18.667 --> 05:21.125
WELL, THEN,

TO KILL IT.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.291

05:42.291 --> 05:43.166
MID-TERMS?

05:43.166 --> 05:44.542
"MID-TERMS."
LIKE I CARE, DAWSON.

05:44.542 --> 05:45.834
I FAILED MY DRIVER'S

05:46.834 --> 05:49.166

OF THAT BIKE, THEN.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.375
VERY FUNNY.

HEARD THEM THIS MORNING

05:55.458 --> 05:57.291
LECTURING JOEY AND ME

05:57.291 --> 05:58.834
ON THE FINER POINTS
OF ADOLESCENT SEXUALITY.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.000
IT WAS MOMENTOUSLY AWKWARD.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.834
OKAY,

06:00.834 --> 06:02.500
DID YOU HEAR NOTHING
I JUST SAID?

06:02.500 --> 06:04.417

TO HAVE GOTTEN IT TODAY.

WELL, TODAY, TWO WEEKS FROM NOW,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

06:13.166 --> 06:15.000

REALLY BEEN ONE

08:39.250 --> 08:40.625
YEAH. THANKS.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.833
OKAY.

08:47.959 --> 08:50.417

THE LAME EXCUSE NOTE
INTENDED TO GET YOU OUT OF GYM

09:00.333 --> 09:02.792
LANDED YOU
WITH CLEAN-UP INSTEAD.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.583
LET'S JUST NOT
TALK TO EACH OTHER,

09:04.583 --> 09:06.500
ALL RIGHT, ABBY?

09:06.500 --> 09:07.583
SINCE YOU ARE
OBVIOUSLY HERE

09:07.583 --> 09:08.834
FOR THE SAME REASON,

09:08.834 --> 09:10.959
AT LEAST YOU CAN
HELP ME CLEAN UP.

09:45.750 --> 09:48.917
YOU GET OUT OF GYM,
BUT NOT CLEAN-UP DUTY.

09:48.917 --> 09:51.917
IT'S NOT SO BRIGHT
FOR A BIG-CITY GIRL.

09:51.917 --> 09:53.083
THEN AGAIN,

09:53.083 --> 09:54.792
YOUR LIFE IN NEW YORK

09:54.792 --> 09:56.834
WAS PROBABLY
JUST AS DULL

09:56.834 --> 09:58.583
AS IT IS
HERE IN CAPESIDE.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.458
I'LL BET YOU NEVER
EVEN GOT INTO A CLUB.

10:01.458 --> 10:02.917
THE THINGS AND PLACES

10:02.917 --> 10:04.458
I HAVE TALKED MYSELF
INTO AND OUT OF

10:04.458 --> 10:05.917
WOULD BLOW YOUR MIND.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.333
YEAH, RIGHT.

10:08.333 --> 10:09.458
SO, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN

10:09.458 --> 10:12.917
TO THE CURTAIN
OR CLUB RETRO?

10:12.917 --> 10:15.875
I DATED THE DOORMAN
AT THE CURTAIN,

10:15.875 --> 10:18.250
AND CLUB RETRO
IS SO FIVE MINUTES AGO.

10:20.166 --> 10:21.250
WELL, WHAT WAS IT LIKE?

10:21.250 --> 10:23.250
WHAT?

10:23.250 --> 10:25.083
NEW YORK.

10:25.083 --> 10:26.625
I'M GOING TO MOVE THERE

10:26.625 --> 10:28.959
WHEN I GRADUATE FROM THIS
JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER.

10:28.959 --> 10:30.834
COME ON, JEN.

10:30.834 --> 10:32.458
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

10:32.458 --> 10:35.917
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?

10:35.917 --> 10:38.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT DO I WANT TO KNOW?

10:38.000 --> 10:40.208
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE GUYS.

10:45.458 --> 10:47.458
Joey: YOU KNOW, AS LONG
AS I LIVE, DAWSON,

10:47.458 --> 10:48.291
I DON'T THINK I WILL
EVER BE AS EMBARRASSED

10:48.291 --> 10:50.125
AS I WAS TODAY.

10:50.125 --> 10:50.625
I KNOW.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.458
MY PARENTS LIVE

10:52.458 --> 10:53.125
FOR THOSE COMING-OF-AGE,
WONDER YEARS  MOMENTS.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.083
YEAH.

10:55.083 --> 10:56.166
MY MOM'S PROBABLY
HAD THAT BOOK

10:56.166 --> 10:57.125
IN A DRAWER
SINCE I WAS BORN.

10:57.125 --> 11:01.417
ALL I CAN SAY IS
THANK GOD IT WAS YOU.

11:01.417 --> 11:02.959
CAN YOU IMAGINE

11:02.959 --> 11:04.834
IF IT WAS JUST SOME
UNSUSPECTING DATE

11:04.834 --> 11:06.500
I'D JUST BROUGHT HOME?

11:06.500 --> 11:08.041
I DON'T KNOW.

11:08.041 --> 11:10.291
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I
HAVE TO WRITE DOWN

11:10.291 --> 11:11.667
YOUR DAD'S
"NO HAT, NO GLOVE" LINE

11:11.667 --> 11:12.667
BEFORE I FORGET.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.500
I MEAN, THAT IS PRICE...

11:18.417 --> 11:19.500
HEY.

11:19.500 --> 11:21.708
HEY.

11:21.708 --> 11:22.792
OH, GOD.

11:22.792 --> 11:25.792
THINK ABOUT IT, YOU
AND ME TOGETHER.

11:25.792 --> 11:26.834
IT'S PERFECT.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.250
YOU KNOW, THERE'S
NONE OF THAT

11:30.250 --> 11:32.834
PRETENTIOUS
GETTING-TO-KNOW-YOU CRAP.

11:32.834 --> 11:34.792
I ALREADY KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

11:34.792 --> 11:39.333
HOW YOU THINK,
HOW YOU FEEL.

11:39.333 --> 11:40.500
REALLY?

11:40.500 --> 11:41.708
YEAH.

11:41.708 --> 11:44.250
YOU THINK YOU KNOW
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME, DAWSON?

11:44.250 --> 11:45.166
COME ON, JOEY.

11:45.166 --> 11:46.208
WE SPEND MOST OF OUR WAKING--

11:46.208 --> 11:47.333
AND SLEEPING, FOR THAT MATTER--

11:47.333 --> 11:48.333
MOMENTS TOGETHER.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.041
YES, I THINK
IT'S FAIRLY SAFE TO SAY

11:50.041 --> 11:50.917
THAT I KNOW EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOU.

11:53.542 --> 11:55.041
WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ME, DAWSON,

11:55.041 --> 11:56.417
COULD FILL A BOOK.

11:56.417 --> 11:57.667
REALLY?

11:57.667 --> 11:58.792
YEAH.

12:02.166 --> 12:05.500
[BABY CRIES]

12:05.500 --> 12:06.375
THAT'S MY LIFE CALLING.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.333
MM.

12:08.333 --> 12:09.708
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

12:09.708 --> 12:10.542

I THOUGHT ALEX

13:10.083 --> 13:10.959
BUT IT TURNS OUT
HE JUST HAD GAS.

13:10.959 --> 13:13.375
I'M GOING
TO GET GOING.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.625
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:14.625 --> 13:15.834
NOTHING.

13:15.834 --> 13:16.959
I THOUGHT YOU HAD

13:16.959 --> 13:18.458
A LOT OF READING
TO DO, DAWSON.

13:18.458 --> 13:21.041
UM, I'VE DONE ENOUGH
READING FOR TODAY.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.166
HEY, MAN, DOCK PARTY,
TONIGHT, 8:00, BAILEY'S WHARF.

13:45.166 --> 13:48.208
BE THERE!

13:48.208 --> 13:49.750
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:49.750 --> 13:51.125
I'M THROWING A PARTY.

13:51.125 --> 13:52.125
WHY?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.125
OH, YOU KNOW,

13:53.125 --> 13:54.458
I'M EXPANDING
MY HORIZONS.

13:54.458 --> 13:55.834
I'M GETTING OLDER.
THOUGHT I'D BRANCH OUT.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.083
TAKE SOME NEW CHANCES.

13:57.083 --> 14:00.083
I ACCIDENTALLY READ
SOMETHING LAST NIGHT

14:00.083 --> 14:01.041
IN JOEY'S JOURNAL.

14:01.041 --> 14:01.875
HEY, WANT ONE OF THESE?

14:01.875 --> 14:03.834
QUOTE, "I'M
SO SICK OF DAWSON

14:03.834 --> 14:05.250
"AND HIS STUPID
HORROR MOVIE.

14:05.250 --> 14:07.250
"I WISH I COULD TELL HIM
HOW TERRIBLE IT IS.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.542
HOW STUPID AND PUTRID
AND RANCID AND..."

14:09.542 --> 14:11.583
IT'S AWFUL.

14:11.583 --> 14:13.083
SO WHAT?

14:13.083 --> 14:14.875
I MEAN, AT LEAST
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU

14:14.875 --> 14:15.708
THAT THE SIGHT OF YOU
GIVES HER DRY HEAVES,

14:15.708 --> 14:19.417
OR THAT YOU'RE
A SELF-CENTERED,

14:19.417 --> 14:20.625
SELF-ABSORBED, SELFISH--

14:20.625 --> 14:22.375
YEAH,

14:22.375 --> 14:23.291
BUT SHE OBVIOUSLY
HAS OPINIONS ABOUT ME

14:23.291 --> 14:25.625
THAT SHE HASN'T
BEEN HONEST ABOUT.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.125
SHE SAID I WAS

14:27.125 --> 14:29.500
"A TALENTLESS DREAMER
WITH NO CINEMATIC FUTURE."

14:29.500 --> 14:30.834
OKAY, NO OFFENSE,
DAWSON,

14:30.834 --> 14:32.792
BUT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CARES.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.500
I CARE, PACEY,

14:34.500 --> 14:36.708
AND I COULD HONESTLY
USE SOME ADVICE HERE.

14:36.708 --> 14:38.750
OH, YOU WANT SOME ADVICE?

14:38.750 --> 14:40.250
HOW ABOUT THIS?

14:40.250 --> 14:42.041
YOUR LIFE
IS NOT THAT INTERESTING.

14:42.041 --> 14:43.166
WHAT?

14:43.166 --> 14:46.041
YOU KNOW, I AM SO SICK AND TIRED
OF HEARING

14:46.041 --> 14:48.041
ABOUT YOU AND JOEY'S
BORING LITTLE MINI-DRAMAS,

14:48.041 --> 14:49.583
I'M GOING TO START
TEARING OUT MY FINGERNAILS

14:49.583 --> 14:50.375
FOR RELIEF.

14:50.375 --> 14:53.125
GET OVER YOURSELF,
DAWSON!

14:53.125 --> 14:54.000
DEAL.

14:59.208 --> 14:59.708
YOU WORK AT
THE ICE HOUSE,

14:59.708 --> 15:01.542
DON'T YOU?

15:01.542 --> 15:02.708
I SAW YOU THERE
TWO NIGHTS AGO.

15:02.708 --> 15:05.000
GOD, I LOVE THAT PLACE.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.667
DON'T GET OUT
MUCH, DO YOU?

15:07.667 --> 15:08.250
ANYWAY,
I'M ANDIE MCPHEE.

15:08.250 --> 15:09.083
YOU'RE JOEY, RIGHT?

15:09.083 --> 15:10.625
I'M A FRIEND
OF PACEY WITTER'S.

15:10.625 --> 15:12.917
WELL, KIND OF.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.875
HOW BOLD OF YOU TO ADMIT THAT.

15:14.875 --> 15:16.041
ANYWAY,

15:16.041 --> 15:17.708
MY BROTHER JACK'S
LOOKING FOR A JOB.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.583
YOU KNOW, BUSBOY, WAITER,
REALLY ANYTHING,

15:19.583 --> 15:21.667
SO I THOUGHT I'D PUT IN
A WORD FOR HIM.

15:21.667 --> 15:22.750
WELL, ACTUALLY,
WE COULD USE THE HELP.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.500
REALLY?
OH, THAT'S GREAT!

15:25.500 --> 15:26.542
HE'S KIND OF SHY,

15:26.542 --> 15:28.125
BUT HE IS REALLY SMART
AND SUPER NICE,

15:28.125 --> 15:29.625
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW HIM.

15:29.625 --> 15:31.750
OKAY, WELL, JUST TELL HIM
TO COME IN AND ASK FOR ME.

15:31.750 --> 15:35.458
ALL RIGHT! THANKS! THANKS A LOT.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.083
JOEY, HEY.

15:42.083 --> 15:44.417
HEY.

15:44.417 --> 15:45.625
I WAS, UM...

15:45.625 --> 15:46.792
THIS MIGHT SOUND WEIRD.

15:46.792 --> 15:49.000
I WAS CLEANING OUT
MY CLOSET THIS MORNING,

15:49.000 --> 15:50.875
AND I FOUND THE COSTUME

15:50.875 --> 15:51.625
THAT YOU WORE
IN MY MOVIE.

15:51.625 --> 15:54.583
I WAS JUST THINKING

15:54.583 --> 15:55.750
ABOUT HOW GOOD
YOU LOOKED IN IT.

15:55.750 --> 15:57.542
UM, YOU KNOW, HOW
PRETTY AND VULNERABLE,

15:57.542 --> 15:58.708
AND I WAS JUST
THINKING, YOU KNOW,

15:58.708 --> 16:01.000
"I HOPE JOEY WAS HAPPY
WITH HER PERFORMANCE

16:01.000 --> 16:02.166
IN THE MOVIE."

16:04.125 --> 16:05.458
I GUESS I'M ASKING--

16:05.458 --> 16:06.625
I'M SURPRISED WE HAVEN'T
DISCUSSED THIS BEFORE--

16:06.625 --> 16:10.750
BUT, UM, WHAT DID YOU
THINK OF MY MOVIE?

16:10.750 --> 16:11.959
I LOVED IT.
IT WAS GREAT.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.667
YOU KNOW THAT, DAWSON.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.166
YOU'D BE HONEST
WITH ME, RIGHT?

16:17.166 --> 16:17.792
IT WAS AMAZING.

16:17.792 --> 16:20.083
EXTREMELY TALENTED.

16:20.083 --> 16:24.125
IT'S ONE OF YOUR
MANY ATTRACTIONS.

16:24.125 --> 16:26.083
LOOK, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

16:26.083 --> 16:27.083
NO, I JUST...

16:27.083 --> 16:29.250
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

16:29.250 --> 16:31.625
THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK MY MOVIE
WAS ON THE, UM...

16:31.625 --> 16:33.333
I DON'T KNOW,
STUPID AND PUTRID SIDE.

16:33.333 --> 16:35.750
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

16:35.750 --> 16:36.500
ARE YOU HAVING
AN INSECURITY ATTACK?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.458
COME ON.

16:38.458 --> 16:40.917
IT'S JUST REALLY
IMPORTANT FOR ME

16:40.917 --> 16:42.166
TO KNOW THAT YOU THINK

16:42.166 --> 16:42.750
THAT I HAVE TALENT
AND POTENTIAL

16:42.750 --> 16:45.542
AS A FILMMAKER.

16:47.834 --> 16:49.208
YOU READ MY JOURNAL.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.333
YOU PRACTICALLY LEFT IT OUT
FOR ME TO SEE.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.667
OH, NOT UNLESS IT BLEW OPEN,

16:54.667 --> 16:56.000
OR YOU SUDDENLY DEVELOPED
X-RAY VISION.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.041
I MEAN, GOD!

16:57.041 --> 16:58.875
HOW DARE YOU?

16:58.875 --> 16:59.834
YOU INVADED MY PRIVACY.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.458
I MEAN,
I COULD SUE YOU FOR THIS.

17:01.458 --> 17:03.834
WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT
IS WHAT ELSE IS IN THAT JOURNAL

17:03.834 --> 17:04.791
THAT YOU DON'T WANT ME TO SEE?

17:04.791 --> 17:05.458
WHAT ELSE DOES
JOEY POTTER

17:05.458 --> 17:07.290
REALLY THINK OF ME?

17:07.290 --> 17:09.000
OH, RIGHT NOW, DAWSON,
YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.165
HEY, COLE.

17:16.165 --> 17:16.834
HEY, MITCH.
WHAT'S UP?

17:16.834 --> 17:19.208
OH, NOT MUCH.

17:19.208 --> 17:20.541
HEY, BUDDY.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.375
JUST CHECKING OUT
A WAREHOUSE NEXT DOOR

17:23.375 --> 17:25.916
AS A POSSIBLE
RESTAURANT LOCATION.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.875
VERY COOL. AND?

17:27.875 --> 17:29.917
RENT'S A LITTLE STEEP.

17:29.917 --> 17:32.208
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.208
OKAY, BUDDY, WHAT'S REALLY UP?

17:34.208 --> 17:37.208
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT'S UP?

17:37.208 --> 17:38.208
NOTHING.

17:38.208 --> 17:39.166
WHATEVER.

17:39.166 --> 17:40.875
YOU KNOW, LIFE.

17:40.875 --> 17:41.875
MITCH, I'VE KNOWN YOU

17:41.875 --> 17:43.750
SINCE WE WERE
IN THE FOURTH GRADE.

17:43.750 --> 17:44.875
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'VE GOT

17:44.875 --> 17:45.792
THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

17:45.792 --> 17:47.333
TALK TO ME.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.792
IT WAS SO KIND OF YOU

18:02.792 --> 18:03.875
TO SEND OVER THAT
DELICIOUS CASSEROLE

18:03.875 --> 18:06.250
WHEN MR. RYAN PASSED.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.333
IT WAS THE LEAST
I COULD DO.

18:09.333 --> 18:10.417
UM...

18:10.417 --> 18:13.041
I WAS WONDERING, UH...

18:13.041 --> 18:14.792
THE THING IS,

18:14.792 --> 18:15.583
MRS. RYAN,

18:15.583 --> 18:19.542
I COULD REALLY USE SOME ADVICE.

18:19.542 --> 18:21.417
MY ADVICE,

18:21.417 --> 18:23.834
YOU'VE GOT TO AVOID
THE BIG "D"

18:23.834 --> 18:24.917
AT ALL COSTS, MAN.

18:24.917 --> 18:26.917
BUT WE'VE TRIED
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

18:26.917 --> 18:28.041
I MEAN,

18:28.041 --> 18:30.000
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S LEFT.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.583
MY BROTHER,
IF YOU GET DIVORCED,

18:32.583 --> 18:34.750
YOU ARE GOING
TO LOSE EVERYTHING.

18:34.750 --> 18:36.959
NOT TO MENTION BECOME
A WEEKEND DADDY TO DAWSON.

18:36.959 --> 18:37.625
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

18:37.625 --> 18:40.083
YOU KNOW,

18:40.083 --> 18:40.917
I DON'T EVEN THINK
SHE WOULD MIND

18:40.917 --> 18:43.708
IF I HAD AN AFFAIR.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.250
LET HER OFF THE HOOK.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.542
SO WHY NOT?

18:46.542 --> 18:49.000
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WHY NOT?"

18:49.000 --> 18:50.917
I'M IN A MARRIAGE.

18:50.917 --> 18:51.708
MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT

18:51.708 --> 18:53.917
ENDURING
THE EBBS AND FLOWS.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.291
YOU MUST DO EVERYTHING
AND ANYTHING

18:55.291 --> 18:57.500
IN YOUR POWER
TO SAVE IT.

18:57.500 --> 19:00.291
BELIEVE ME, I HAVE TALKED
UNTIL I AM BLUE IN THE FACE.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.083
I'VE CLEANED OUT
THE ENTIRE MARITAL AIDS SECTION

19:02.083 --> 19:04.458
AT THE PLEASURE PALACE,

19:04.458 --> 19:07.291
AND MY VICTORIA'S SECRET
CREDIT CARD IS MAXED.

19:07.291 --> 19:09.834
I WAS THINKING
MORE ALONG THE LINES

19:09.834 --> 19:10.625
OF SOMETHING LIKE

19:10.625 --> 19:12.417
RENEWING YOUR
WEDDING VOWS.

19:12.417 --> 19:15.291
I WASN'T SUGGESTING
THAT YOU HAVE AN AFFAIR.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.125
AN AFFAIR WON'T FIX IT.

19:16.125 --> 19:18.125
I'M NOT SUGGESTING
AN AFFAIR.

19:18.125 --> 19:20.750
I'M TALKING
OPEN MARRIAGE.

19:20.750 --> 19:23.792
[SCOFFS]

19:23.792 --> 19:26.917
I KNEW THAT THE '70S
WERE BACK IN FULL SWING, MAN,

19:26.917 --> 19:28.333
BUT THAT IS
RIGHT UP THERE

19:28.333 --> 19:29.875
WITH BEAN BAG CHAIRS
AND LAVA LAMPS.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.417
NOW, JUST THINK ABOUT
THIS FOR A MINUTE,

19:31.417 --> 19:32.375
ALL RIGHT?

19:32.375 --> 19:33.667
IN ANY GIVEN MARRIAGE,

19:33.667 --> 19:34.875
STATISTICALLY YOU'VE
GOT AN 85% CHANCE

19:34.875 --> 19:36.083
OF INFIDELITY.

19:36.083 --> 19:38.166
HUMAN BEINGS
ARE JUST NOT

19:38.166 --> 19:39.333
INSTINCTIVELY
MONOGAMOUS.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.291
ALL RIGHT?

19:40.291 --> 19:41.625
SO YOU TAKE

19:41.625 --> 19:43.834
THE ANTIQUATED NOTION
OF FIDELITY AND MONOGAMY

19:43.834 --> 19:44.834
OUT OF MARRIAGE,

19:44.834 --> 19:46.500
AND I PROMISE YOU,
I GUARANTEE YOU

19:46.500 --> 19:47.291
THAT THE DIVORCE RATE
IN THIS COUNTRY

19:47.291 --> 19:48.959
WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY ZILCH.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.250
WORKS FOR ME AND LISA.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.834
YOU KNOW, I HATE IT
WHEN PEOPLE PLASTER

20:06.834 --> 20:07.959
UNSOLICITED MATERIAL
ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
MCPHEE?

20:09.500 --> 20:11.542
I REALLY WISH YOU WEREN'T HERE
RIGHT NOW.

20:11.542 --> 20:14.291
PUT THE CHARM ON HOLD
FOR A SECOND, PACEY.

20:14.291 --> 20:15.041
I WAS JUST CURIOUS
WHAT THE OCCASION'S FOR.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.375
IT'S MY GOING AWAY PARTY.

20:17.375 --> 20:18.959
I'M DYING OF A HEART STRIPE,
OR HADN'T YOU HEARD?

20:18.959 --> 20:20.000
WHERE'S YOUR
SENSE OF HUMOR?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.083
OH, I HAVE
A SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.208
IN FACT, I HAVE A REALLY GOOD
SENSE OF HUMOR.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.417
IT'S JUST THAT
TELLING A GIRL

20:24.417 --> 20:26.250
THAT I'M DYING SO
SHE'LL GO OUT WITH ME,

20:26.250 --> 20:27.792
THAT'S JUST NOT FUNNY.

20:27.792 --> 20:29.083
WHY YOU WOULD BE
INTERESTED IN SOMEONE

20:29.083 --> 20:30.708
WHO IS SO MENTALLY DEFICIENT

20:30.708 --> 20:31.959
THAT SHE WOULD
ACTUALLY BELIEVE

20:31.959 --> 20:33.583
THERE'S SUCH A THING
AS A HEART STRIPE...

20:33.583 --> 20:34.875
OKAY, OKAY.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.041
I'M SORRY. TRUCE.

20:36.041 --> 20:38.083
SO REALLY,

20:38.083 --> 20:38.750
WHAT'S THE REASON
FOR YOUR LITTLE CLAMBAKE?

20:38.750 --> 20:40.834
OH, I'M SORRY.

20:40.834 --> 20:41.625
WERE YOU UNDER
THE MISTAKEN IMPRESSION

20:41.625 --> 20:43.250
THAT YOU WERE ACTUALLY INVITED?

20:43.250 --> 20:44.500
WELL, IT SAYS,
"COME ONE, COME ALL."

20:44.500 --> 20:47.291
NO, YOU'VE GOT TO READ
THE FINE PRINT.

20:47.291 --> 20:48.959
IT SAYS, "COME ON, COME ALL,

20:48.959 --> 20:50.208
"EXCEPT SPOILED
TRUST FUND CASUALTIES

20:50.208 --> 20:51.667
FROM RHODE ISLAND."

20:51.667 --> 20:53.417
HMM.

20:53.417 --> 20:54.625
SORRY.

20:54.625 --> 20:55.834
HMM.

20:57.375 --> 20:59.083
THIS IS CHARLIE,

20:59.083 --> 21:01.375
THE GUY I WAS
TELLING YOU ABOUT.

21:01.375 --> 21:03.458
OH, MY GOD.

21:03.458 --> 21:04.875
LOOK AT HIM.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.500
OH, GOD,

21:06.500 --> 21:09.166
I WOULD THROW MY
MOTHER OFF A BRIDGE

21:09.166 --> 21:11.083
TO GO OUT WITH
SOMEBODY LIKE THIS.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.583
WE PARTIED IN ATLANTIC CITY
ONE WEEKEND

21:13.583 --> 21:15.708
BEFORE HE HAD TO SHIP OUT.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.250
CRAZY.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.417
I CAN'T BELIEVE

21:17.417 --> 21:19.166
THAT YOU HAVE EYES
FOR DAWSON LEERY.

21:19.166 --> 21:23.125
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
LIVED, SISTER.

21:23.125 --> 21:26.417
SPEAKING OF PARTYING,

21:26.417 --> 21:28.375
SINCE YOU'RE NOT
HANGING OUT

21:28.375 --> 21:29.875
WITH FORREST GUMP
AND COMPANY ANYMORE,

21:29.875 --> 21:30.917
I WAS THINKING

21:30.917 --> 21:34.375
WE COULD DO SOME
SERIOUS PARTYING OF OUR OWN.

21:34.375 --> 21:35.542
WHAT,

21:35.542 --> 21:37.417
LIKE STEAL A PACK OF CIGARETTES
FROM 7-ELEVEN

21:37.417 --> 21:39.834
AND SMOKE THEM
BEHIND THE BLEACHERS?

21:39.834 --> 21:40.959
NO.
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:40.959 --> 21:43.500
I WAS THINKING
PACEY'S BOGUS DOCK PARTY.

21:43.500 --> 21:47.458
I MEAN, WE COULD CRACK
ON THE PEOPLE THERE...

21:47.458 --> 21:48.417
AND...

21:50.750 --> 21:52.625
A LITTLE IMPORTED BUBBLY
FOR OUR ENJOYMENT.

21:58.166 --> 21:59.750
ALL RIGHT, SO I SHOULDN'T
HAVE READ YOUR JOURNAL,

21:59.750 --> 22:00.959
BUT COME ON,
YOU CAN'T TELL ME

22:00.959 --> 22:01.875
ALL THE TIME YOU'VE
BEEN ALONE IN MY ROOM

22:01.875 --> 22:03.375
THAT YOU'VE
NEVER SNOOPED.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.333
NO.

22:04.333 --> 22:05.458
NOT ONCE?

22:05.458 --> 22:08.125
NO, BECAUSE I, UNLIKE YOU,
RESPECT YOUR PRIVACY.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.792
YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T RESPECT

22:09.792 --> 22:10.834
MY FILMMAKING ABILITIES.

22:10.834 --> 22:11.959
DAWSON, HOW I FEEL

22:11.959 --> 22:13.333
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR QUEST
TO BE SPIELBERG, JR.

22:13.333 --> 22:14.333
IS NOT THE POINT.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.708
YOU READ MY JOURNAL.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.291
THIS IS A HUGE PRIVACY ISSUE.

22:17.291 --> 22:18.667
JOEY, THAT'S
EXACTLY THE POINT.

22:18.667 --> 22:19.959
HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT MY FILMMAKING--

22:19.959 --> 22:21.166
HI. I'M, UH, JACK.

22:21.166 --> 22:22.500
CAN I HELP YOU?

22:22.500 --> 22:23.500
ANDIE'S BROTHER.

22:23.500 --> 22:24.834
WHO'S ANDIE?

22:24.834 --> 22:26.083
MY SISTER.

22:26.083 --> 22:27.667
LOOK, THAT'S FASCINATING,
AND I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

22:27.667 --> 22:31.041
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M REALLY BUSY HERE, SO--

22:31.041 --> 22:33.000
I'M HERE TO INTERVIEW
FOR THE JOB.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.083
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.

22:34.083 --> 22:35.792
JACK, ANDIE'S BROTHER.

22:35.792 --> 22:38.667
UM, LISTEN, HAVE YOU EVER
WASHED DISHES BEFORE?

22:38.667 --> 22:40.625
NO, BUT I'M WILLING TO LEARN.

22:40.625 --> 22:41.667
GOOD. INTERVIEW'S OVER.
KITCHEN'S THAT WAY.

22:46.291 --> 22:47.291
I ADMIT,

22:47.291 --> 22:48.250
WHAT I DID
WAS WRONG,

22:48.250 --> 22:49.333
BUT, JOEY,
YOU LIED TO ME.

22:49.333 --> 22:50.625
YOU'VE BEEN
LYING TO ME.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.500
DON'T TURN THIS AROUND
AND MAKE ME THE BAD GUY, DAWSON.

22:52.500 --> 22:53.750
YOU VIOLATED ME.
YOU BETRAYED ME.

22:53.750 --> 22:55.750
TELL ME, WERE YOU EVER PLANNING
ON TELLING ME THE TRUTH?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.291
WHY SHOULD I?

22:57.291 --> 22:58.708
I THOUGHT I'D JUST
WRITE IT ALL DOWN

22:58.708 --> 22:59.458
AND THEN HAVE YOU OVER TO STUDY.

22:59.458 --> 23:00.208
STOP MAKING JOKES,
JOEY.

23:00.208 --> 23:02.250
THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.375
YOU WERE COMPLETELY DISHONEST.

23:03.375 --> 23:04.417
YOU'RE RIGHT, DAWSON.

23:04.417 --> 23:05.583
IT IS A BIG DEAL,

23:05.583 --> 23:06.792
BUT THE BIG DEAL
ISN'T WHAT YOU READ.

23:06.792 --> 23:08.041
THE BIG DEAL
IS THAT YOU READ IT.

23:08.041 --> 23:09.041
I APOLOGIZED FOR THAT ALREADY--

23:09.041 --> 23:09.708
EXCUSE ME.

23:09.708 --> 23:10.834
IF YOU HAVE A SECOND,

23:10.834 --> 23:12.792
COULD YOU TELL YOUR SISTER
I WORK HERE NOW,

23:12.792 --> 23:14.250
BECAUSE SHE'S NOT LETTING ME
IN THE KITCHEN.

23:14.250 --> 23:15.625
[SIGHS]

23:18.208 --> 23:19.291
I'M GLAD I READ IT,
ACTUALLY.

23:19.291 --> 23:22.250
BECAUSE NOW I REALIZE I...

23:22.250 --> 23:25.875
I DON'T THINK I KNOW YOU AT ALL.

23:25.875 --> 23:27.208
MAYBE YOU DON'T, DAWSON.

23:27.208 --> 23:29.208
MAYBE YOU NEVER DID.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.834
HEY.

23:40.834 --> 23:43.417
HEY, IF IT ISN'T
ANDIE MCPHEE,

23:43.417 --> 23:44.917

RICH GIRL IN TOWN.

23:44.917 --> 23:45.917
WHAT HAPPENED?

23:45.917 --> 23:47.083
THEY CANCEL
YOUR POLO MATCH?

23:47.083 --> 23:48.250
LOOK, PACEY, IF YOU WANT ME
TO LEAVE, I WILL.

23:48.250 --> 23:49.333
NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S OKAY.

23:49.333 --> 23:51.250
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE
THE ONLY PERSON

23:51.250 --> 23:52.834
THAT I RECOGNIZE HERE,

23:52.834 --> 23:54.125
AND I ASK YOU,
HOW SAD IS THAT?

23:54.125 --> 23:55.291
DON'T WORRY.

23:55.291 --> 23:56.583
PARTIES ALWAYS TAKE
A WHILE TO GET GOING,

23:56.583 --> 23:57.542
THOUGH YOU MIGHT'VE

23:57.542 --> 23:59.291
WORKED A DEEJAY
INTO YOUR BUDGET.

23:59.291 --> 24:00.250
CAN'T SAY IT HASN'T
BEEN PLEASANT

24:00.250 --> 24:01.333
TALKING TO YOU,

24:01.333 --> 24:02.250
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

24:02.250 --> 24:03.667
YOU SHOULD GET OUT
AND MINGLE

24:03.667 --> 24:04.959
AND MEET SOME
NEW PEOPLE?

24:04.959 --> 24:06.291
YEAH, I PROBABLY SHOULD,

24:06.291 --> 24:08.333
BUT NEW PEOPLE
MAKE ME NERVOUS.

24:08.333 --> 24:09.917
I NEVER KNOW
WHAT TO SAY,

24:09.917 --> 24:15.000
AND THEN, EVENTUALLY,
I JUST CLAM UP TOTALLY.

24:15.000 --> 24:16.500
YOU JOKING?

24:16.500 --> 24:17.583
BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
STOPPED TALKING

24:17.583 --> 24:20.250
SINCE THE MOMENT
I MET YOU.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.083
WELL, YOU DON'T MAKE ME NERVOUS.
YOU MAKE ME MAD.

24:21.083 --> 24:23.291
MAD BEATS NERVOUS.

24:23.291 --> 24:25.875
OKAY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST GO MINGLE NOW, YEAH?

24:25.875 --> 24:26.959
YOU GO MINGLE.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.792
OKAY.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.041
OKAY.

CHECKING YOU OUT.

24:38.458 --> 24:39.250
SHE'S LOOKING AT ME?

24:39.250 --> 24:41.500
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

24:41.500 --> 24:42.875
I HAVEN'T HAD
A WHOLE LOT OF LUCK

24:42.875 --> 24:43.667
WITH THE SENIOR CHEERLEADERS
THIS YEAR.

24:43.667 --> 24:46.625
LUCK HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

HAPPEN TO LIKE YOUNGER MEN.

24:48.291 --> 24:49.458

24:49.458 --> 24:50.792
SO GO AHEAD.

24:50.792 --> 24:52.291
GO TALK TO HER.
WHAT DO YOU GOT TO LOSE?

24:52.291 --> 24:56.417
OH, I DON'T KNOW,
DIGNITY, HUMILITY, FACE.

24:56.417 --> 24:57.792
AH, IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU HAD ANY OF THOSE THINGS

24:57.792 --> 24:58.959
TO BEGIN WITH.

24:58.959 --> 25:00.000
OKAY. YOU KNOW WHAT, MCPHEE?

25:00.000 --> 25:02.917
I REALLY WISH
I MADE YOU NERVOUS.

25:02.917 --> 25:04.291

25:32.333 --> 25:34.667
HAVING A GOOD TIME?

25:34.667 --> 25:38.083
THIS IS FUNKY.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.458
OH, HA! SO FUNNY.

25:46.458 --> 25:46.708
OH!

26:07.625 --> 26:10.417
OKAY, HOW MANY DRINKS
HAVE I HAD?

26:10.417 --> 26:13.375
BECAUSE I THINK
THREE IS MY LIMIT

26:13.375 --> 26:14.708

OF THIS BOTTLE

26:34.083 --> 26:35.250
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE BERRIES

26:35.250 --> 26:37.333

HAVEN'T HAD

31:31.917 --> 31:33.208
AND HOW...

IN MOST MARITAL PROBLEMS.

TO OPEN THIS THING UP

HMM...

40:10.041 --> 40:12.291
I'M SORRY.

40:12.291 --> 40:13.708
IT'S THE THOUGHT
THAT COUNTS.

40:13.708 --> 40:18.834
I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN
THIS COMPLETE KLUTZ.

40:18.834 --> 40:21.250
SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

40:21.250 --> 40:24.750
NO. EVERYTHING CHANGES.

40:24.750 --> 40:27.750
EVERYBODY CHANGES.
EXCEPT FOR ME.

40:27.750 --> 40:31.583
TAKE THIS WHOLE STUPID PARTY,
FOR EXAMPLE.

40:31.583 --> 40:32.875
I THOUGHT I COULD AT LEAST BE

40:32.875 --> 40:36.166
"PACEY WITTER, THE GUY
WHO THROWS A GOOD PARTY,"

40:36.166 --> 40:38.125
BUT NO, I'M STILL JUST

40:38.125 --> 40:40.208
"PACEY WITTER, THE GUY
WHO'S FAILING BIOLOGY,"

40:40.208 --> 40:41.500
BUT NOW I'M A YEAR OLDER.

40:43.208 --> 40:44.083
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU'RE JUST

40:44.083 --> 40:46.333
"PACEY WITTER,

40:46.333 --> 40:48.291
THE GUY WHO'S STILL TRYING
TO FIGURE IT OUT."

40:51.041 --> 40:52.708
WOW.

40:52.708 --> 40:54.583
WHAT?

40:54.583 --> 40:58.834
WE ARE SO...

40:58.834 --> 40:59.875
DEEP.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.792
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN GET HOME OKAY?

41:29.375 --> 41:30.458
I'VE GOT TO GO BACK.

41:30.458 --> 41:32.959
I'VE GOT TO TRY
AND TALK TO PACEY.

41:32.959 --> 41:33.959
OH.

41:33.959 --> 41:38.917
YEAH.

41:38.917 --> 41:40.542
OKAY.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.750
I'LL BE FINE.

PACEY, I'VE BEEN

42:16.166 --> 42:17.500
A REALLY LOUSY FRIEND
LATELY, AND...

42:17.500 --> 42:20.041
THERE'S NO EXCUSE FOR
FORGETTING YOUR BIRTHDAY,

42:20.041 --> 42:22.667
BUT IT'S NOT BECAUSE
I'VE WRITTEN YOU OFF.

42:22.667 --> 42:23.834
IT'S JUST THIS--
THIS JOEY THING

42:23.834 --> 42:28.875
HAS BEEN SO INCREDIBLY
CONFUSING AND COMPLICATED--

42:28.875 --> 42:30.583
DAWSON, DAWSON, DAWSON,
IT'S OKAY, MAN.

42:30.583 --> 42:31.542
I FORGIVE YOU.

42:31.542 --> 42:33.125
I'M HAPPY
FOR YOU TWO.

YOU DESERVE
HAPPINESS.

42:34.417 --> 42:36.041
GOD KNOWS IT TOOK
LONG ENOUGH.

42:36.041 --> 42:38.708
THE ONLY THING
THAT I WAS TRYING TO SAY

42:38.708 --> 42:39.708
IS THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS

42:39.708 --> 42:42.875
THAT I'M GOING TO MISS,
AS YOUR FRIEND.

42:42.875 --> 42:44.875
THAT'S NATURAL.
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

42:44.875 --> 42:47.625
BUT TO ME
IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL.

42:47.625 --> 42:50.041
MAYBE MY ACTIONS HAVEN'T EXACTLY
SHOWN THAT LATELY,

42:50.041 --> 42:52.875
BUT IT'S JUST BECAUSE EVERYTHING
IS REALLY COMPLICATED

42:52.875 --> 42:54.708
AND EVERYTHING'S CHANGING,

42:54.708 --> 42:55.708
BUT NOTHING
IS EVER GONNA CHANGE SO MUCH

42:55.708 --> 42:57.834
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE
MY BEST FRIEND.

43:04.375 --> 43:06.458
ARE WE HAVING A MOMENT HERE?

43:06.458 --> 43:07.708
I THINK WE ARE.

43:09.250 --> 43:10.834
LET'S GO.
YEAH.

43:15.083 --> 43:17.250
IT'S REALLY TOO BAD
ABOUT YOUR LICENSE.

43:17.250 --> 43:18.166
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

43:18.166 --> 43:19.208
I CAN TAKE
THE TEST AGAIN

43:19.208 --> 43:20.041
IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS.

43:21.291 --> 43:22.917
MAYBE YOU NEED
SOME MORE PRACTICE.

43:22.917 --> 43:24.208
PLEASE. YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW

43:24.208 --> 43:25.917
I'VE BEEN BREAKING
THAT STATE LAW

43:25.917 --> 43:27.417
FOR AT LEAST
THE LAST THREE YEARS.

43:27.417 --> 43:28.667
I MEAN, RIGHT NOW.

43:28.667 --> 43:29.583
WHAT?

43:29.583 --> 43:31.250
YOU AND ME. MAINE.
RIGHT NOW.

43:31.250 --> 43:34.125
WHAT?
I KNOW WHERE THE KEYS
TO THE MITCHMOBILE ARE.

43:34.125 --> 43:35.792
OH, PLEASE, DAWSON.
YOUR FATHER WOULD
KILL YOU.

43:35.792 --> 43:38.792
DON'T WUSS OUT
ON ME NOW, PACEY.

43:38.792 --> 43:40.417
LISTEN, DAWSON,
WE'RE COOL, MAN.

43:40.417 --> 43:42.041
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

43:42.041 --> 43:44.083
SHUT UP.
MAYBE I WANT TO.

43:51.333 --> 43:52.333
PACEY?

43:52.333 --> 43:53.417

43:53.417 --> 43:56.083
