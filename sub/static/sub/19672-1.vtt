WEBVTT

00:06.939 --> 00:10.676
>> And I bear the scars
for my association...

00:14.614 --> 00:16.715
And to be perfectly blunt,
herpes is a traveling partner

00:16.717 --> 00:24.223
that occasionally taps me on
the shoulder and reminds me

00:24.225 --> 00:29.661
of those many many many days.

00:29.663 --> 00:37.036
The stab wound to my side is a
constant reminder of those many,

00:37.038 --> 00:48.080
many days, it said not, I said
it is said not to associate

00:48.082 --> 00:52.484
with anyone who bears the name
of brother if he is guilty.

00:52.486 --> 00:53.786
>> I've never believed
in prayer,

00:53.788 --> 00:55.521
but you'll be surprise
what comes naturally

00:55.523 --> 00:57.823
when your ass is on the line.

00:57.825 --> 01:02.227
This was not supposed to end
like this, it just wasn't.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.364
>> It is as clear as the
clearest of all gems.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.465
I am re-born.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.400
The lord is here.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.169
The lord is with me.

01:10.171 --> 01:14.940
The lord has given
me a second chance.

01:14.942 --> 01:20.846
You got that opportunity
to have a soul as shinny

01:20.848 --> 01:24.450
as a brand new Cadillac.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:42.188 --> 03:46.091
>> And this is where it all
started about three weeks ago.

03:46.093 --> 03:47.593
This is albamarle.

03:47.595 --> 03:51.163
Here in bed stuy, he is
the local businessman slash

03:51.165 --> 03:51.863
king ping.

03:51.865 --> 03:53.298
>> Keep your voice down.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.566
>> I don't give a
fuck about them.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.634
>> Keep your voice down.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.869
>> I don't give a fuck.

03:57.871 --> 04:01.740
Back in the day, if we had
a problem, we didn't go

04:01.742 --> 04:03.375
around shooting up place.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.811
>> I'm tired of this shit.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.379
How did this shit happen?

04:07.381 --> 04:10.749
>> Chris said he was
just Manning the store

04:10.751 --> 04:13.218
and the d's just rushed in.

04:13.220 --> 04:15.220
>> Fool must've sold them
some shit inside the store.

04:15.222 --> 04:17.589
>> I seen him at the precinct.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.959
He said he's been doing the same
shit for the last ten years.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.961
>> He fucked up.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.363
That's that nice guy shit.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.933
That store is a staple
in the community.

04:27.935 --> 04:31.403
Nigga try to do right and a
bunch of cops raid my shit.

04:31.405 --> 04:32.971
We help motherfuckers
in that store.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.208
>> What about Billy?

04:36.210 --> 04:40.145
>> Billy, Billy is a pussy.

04:40.147 --> 04:40.979
It ain't Billy.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.715
Besides we have an agreement.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.785
>> Can't believe you still
respecting that shit, man.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.853
They making us run around here

04:47.855 --> 04:49.454
with all this money,
man, they fronting.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.424
>> Now, if I could
go back even further.

05:08.441 --> 05:11.243
Over a year ago, albamale,
because he was going

05:11.245 --> 05:15.213
through some new spiritual
awaking, he had a meeting

05:15.215 --> 05:17.182
with Billy, Billy fungus.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.918
In a nutshell, they agreed
to conduct business much

05:19.920 --> 05:23.155
like they do on wall
street, no guns, no knives.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.556
Billy agreed to this deal

05:24.558 --> 05:27.793
because he himself didn't
believe he could overthrow

05:27.795 --> 05:29.394
albamale by force.

05:29.396 --> 05:33.198
Same time outside, the two
rivals muscles was having a

05:33.200 --> 05:34.533
powwow themselves.

05:34.535 --> 05:38.003
>> Yah mon, let us handle
it, mon because we run this.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.871
>> You're still holding
your head on to that.

05:39.873 --> 05:42.474
All you niggas did was
destroy your own community

05:42.476 --> 05:44.209
and you niggas talking
about you run something.

05:44.211 --> 05:46.044
You niggas ain't
never build nothing.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.080
Bunch of clowns running
through destroying shit.

05:48.082 --> 05:50.382
The only thing left over
is bunch of graveyards

05:50.384 --> 05:51.783
of fuckin beef Patty spots.

05:51.785 --> 05:54.653
>> Let me tell you this,
this is what left now.

05:54.655 --> 05:58.724
Man like me, who is here to clip
a chicken pussy wing like you.

05:58.726 --> 06:00.292
>> Well, let me tell you this.

06:00.294 --> 06:01.660
>> Well, you know how that goes.

06:01.662 --> 06:04.196
>> So you want to go to war.

06:04.198 --> 06:07.165
>> I want to do something.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.735
>> Nigga I've been
warring my whole life,

06:09.737 --> 06:11.236
and I never made a dime from it.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.138
There's no money in war.

06:13.140 --> 06:16.742
>> Well, we need to find out
what he's doing cause ain't none

06:16.744 --> 06:19.111
of his got hit in a long time.

06:19.113 --> 06:24.983
>> Yo man, I heard he is
using that black heart shit.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.351
>> He's using what?

06:26.353 --> 06:31.390
>> The obeah, the card flipping,
you know the miss Cleo shit?

06:31.392 --> 06:34.393
>> That voodoo.

06:34.395 --> 06:35.794
>> So you're trying to tell me

06:35.796 --> 06:40.332
that Billy is getting
rich from voodoo.

06:40.334 --> 06:42.634
You motherfuckers
are disappointing me

06:42.636 --> 06:44.636
with this shit, man.

06:44.638 --> 06:46.071
>> Voodoo is not the issue, man.

06:46.073 --> 06:47.472
>> No, it's not the issue.

06:47.474 --> 06:51.810
Look. I don't believe in voodoo,
i don't believe in black magic,

06:51.812 --> 06:54.946
I don't believe in witchcraft,
but you heard something

06:54.948 --> 06:57.816
and you didn't tell me.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.952
>> So like what was I suppose
to do, come to you and say,

07:00.954 --> 07:02.053
yo Billy is using voodoo?

07:02.055 --> 07:04.022
How the fuck does that sound?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.291
I would have threw me out if
i said some shit like that.

07:06.293 --> 07:10.495
>> Regardless, I can't take
any more hits like this.

07:10.497 --> 07:12.831
Now you go find that nigga Billy
and find out what he's doing

07:12.833 --> 07:15.333
and set up a face to
face with me and him.

07:15.335 --> 07:17.068
You got that?

07:17.070 --> 07:18.236
>> Got you.

07:18.238 --> 07:19.337
>> Hold on, dog.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.340
>> You know I grew up
in bed-stuy, right?

07:22.342 --> 07:27.412
>> Which you always seem to
let me know that, yes you have.

07:27.414 --> 07:30.982
>> I've got a mom from
Jamaica, pops from Trinidad,

07:30.984 --> 07:33.618
so I'm a little familiar
with this voodoo shit, man.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.820
Still don't believe in it?

07:34.822 --> 07:37.355
>> Here we go with this shit.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.891
I believe in that just like
i believe in the tooth fairy.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.427
>> You know somebody
put a spell on my pops

07:42.429 --> 07:44.596
when I was a kid, right?

07:44.598 --> 07:47.132
>> Your daddy told you that?

07:47.134 --> 07:50.101
>> Actually it was
the craziest thing.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.736
That bitch actually
came to my house

07:51.738 --> 07:54.372
and did her spell right
there in front of me.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.440
>> You a motherfucker liar?

07:55.442 --> 07:57.776
>> I kid you not, man.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.478
I was twelve years old.

08:05.352 --> 08:09.120
>> Is your father home?

08:09.122 --> 08:12.557
Can I come in?

08:12.559 --> 08:15.627
>> That bitch was so
fine, I just let her in.

08:15.629 --> 08:20.031
I just opened the door and she
asked me if I remember her.

08:20.033 --> 08:23.034
>> You might have seen me
before with your father.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.870
>> She told me her
name was Clarence.

08:24.872 --> 08:25.704
>> I'm Clarence.

08:25.706 --> 08:26.671
>> And I've probably seen her

08:26.673 --> 08:27.772
around with my father
a few times.

08:27.774 --> 08:28.273
She asked me if she
can use the bathroom.

08:28.275 --> 08:28.773
>> Thanks.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.666
>> Next thing you
know, she turns around

09:27.668 --> 09:31.937
and her makeup was all
smeared and all over the place.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.472
I didn't even recognize
the lady anymore.

09:39.146 --> 09:48.219
So she goes in my father's room
and she opens up his closet

09:49.555 --> 09:57.295
and she starts to spray his
clothes with all this stuff.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.064
I have no idea what
any of it was

09:59.066 --> 10:01.099
but two months later
my father was dead.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.902
>> I feel sorry for you.

10:03.904 --> 10:07.973
>> Motherfucker was eighty-five
pounds when he passed away.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.441
I don't know where the lady went

10:09.443 --> 10:10.742
and I never saw her
again afterwards.

10:10.744 --> 10:12.410
But I told myself when I do,
I'm going to wrap my hands

10:12.412 --> 10:13.478
around her fucking neck.

10:20.153 --> 10:22.787
>> Dude, you really crazy.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.457
>> Speaking of, there goes
that nigga fafa right there.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.466
>> Hey, yo, fafa.

10:44.677 --> 10:47.479
>> What do you want?

10:47.481 --> 10:52.350
>> Alabamarle wants to
meet with Billy, man.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.019
>> So?

10:55.254 --> 10:58.823
>> So I want you to
deliver the message.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.225
>> I don't deal with Billy.

11:00.227 --> 11:05.597
>> So you can't do this one
little simple thing for me?

11:05.599 --> 11:06.798
>> Buy a carton.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.801
>> Fuck that, man, we
not buying anything, dog.

11:09.803 --> 11:11.403
What you think because
you got some tattoos

11:11.405 --> 11:17.142
and selling cigarettes
you a hustler now?

11:17.144 --> 11:18.543
>> So if I buy a carton you
gonna deliver the message?

11:18.545 --> 11:19.911
How much?

11:19.913 --> 11:20.745
>> Fifty dollars.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.946
>> No, we not paying that, man.

11:21.948 --> 11:22.647
Trev, come on put your
money back in your pocket.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.481
>> Take sixty.

11:34.093 --> 11:38.930
>> You gonna deliver that
message to him, right?

11:38.932 --> 11:40.331
>> Stupid.

11:42.401 --> 11:44.202
>> Where we going?

11:44.204 --> 11:46.337
>> To get sanctified.

11:47.740 --> 11:51.409
>> Yo either tell me where the
fuck we're going or turn around.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.712
>> Sanctified that's his name.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.014
He used to be a straight
thief involved in everything

11:56.016 --> 11:58.216
but then the dude found god.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.585
So I figured if we need to
know something about somebody,

12:00.587 --> 12:02.454
why not a crook turned minister?

13:17.163 --> 13:20.331
>> Corn, little youngin.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.332
>> What's going on, man?

13:21.334 --> 13:22.167
Just passing through.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.601
That's my boy Trevor right here.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.903
>> Hey, how you doing Trevor?

13:24.905 --> 13:29.574
>> I'd be doing a lot better
if I knew why we was here.

13:29.576 --> 13:31.543
>> Santified.

13:31.545 --> 13:34.045
>> Corn, call me booker.

13:34.047 --> 13:35.013
>> Booker?

13:35.015 --> 13:39.217
>> Yah, booker Seymour
Washington.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.319
>> Booker Washington?

13:41.321 --> 13:46.024
>> My mother thought
that I would become a man

13:46.026 --> 13:47.358
who could make a difference.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.193
>> Well, have you?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.094
>> Sure, robbing and stealing.

13:50.096 --> 13:55.667
It took a long time for me to
recognize the good within me.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.504
We all have good within us
no matter how bad we may be.

13:59.506 --> 14:04.409
The only difference
between the good and bad is

14:04.411 --> 14:07.612
that the bad don't listen
to that little voice.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.547
You see bad is sweet.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.382
Bad is instant gratification.

14:11.384 --> 14:12.517
Bad is sexy.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.387
But it comes with the
expense of your soul.

14:16.389 --> 14:19.090
I know, you know I could go
on and on like this for days,

14:19.092 --> 14:23.061
but I know you two have
a reason for being here.

14:23.063 --> 14:26.898
>> Yeah, we want to
know about Billy.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.166
Billy fungus.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.101
We ain't cops.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.637
>> I know youngin ain't no cop.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.707
>> Look man, we came here
to avoid a war, all right?

14:35.709 --> 14:37.342
>> A war with Billy fungus?

14:37.344 --> 14:39.277
>> Look, our places
are getting raided,

14:39.279 --> 14:41.379
our dudes are getting
picked up on the street.

14:41.381 --> 14:42.814
We know he's behind this.

14:42.816 --> 14:43.748
>> Why come to me?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.817
You know I left this life.

14:45.819 --> 14:48.119
>> What we know is that
you know everything

14:48.121 --> 14:50.188
that goes on in this community.

14:50.190 --> 14:53.791
So we was just hoping that
maybe you would choose

14:53.793 --> 14:56.127
to listen to our voices.

14:56.129 --> 14:59.197
>> Okay. What have you heard?

14:59.199 --> 15:02.467
>> We heard that he
been using the voodoo.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.502
>> That's pretty good because
that's what I've heard.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.703
>> Man, he's shitting us, man.

15:05.705 --> 15:06.905
Why you even say that, man?

15:06.907 --> 15:08.039
We don't even need to hear that.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.774
>> No. What you need is not

15:09.776 --> 15:12.977
to underestimate what
you already know.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.479
>> So you believe
in that shit too?

15:14.481 --> 15:16.915
>> I believe it's a religion.

15:16.917 --> 15:22.053
You see, there was a book
written many years ago

15:22.055 --> 15:27.492
in the eighteen hundreds called
"Haiti or the black Republic."

15:27.494 --> 15:34.232
This book described voodoo as
a profoundly evil religion.

15:34.234 --> 15:40.405
It included lurid descriptions
of animal sacrifice,

15:40.407 --> 15:44.909
cannibalism, human sacrifice,
blood drinking, grave digging.

15:44.911 --> 15:49.180
This caught the attention of
the west and is responsible

15:49.182 --> 15:53.718
for the fear that is
present in most people today.

15:53.720 --> 15:58.156
You see many people, when
they hear the word voodoo,

15:58.158 --> 16:04.195
they think about crystal balls,
bat wings, devil worship.

16:04.197 --> 16:10.702
But what I know now, it is
a religion like any other.

16:10.704 --> 16:13.938
Now, here in the west
we call it voodoo.

16:13.940 --> 16:18.209
It's a bastardized name form
a west African word vodun.

16:18.211 --> 16:23.214
They worship the earth, the
water, the sky, the trees,

16:23.216 --> 16:25.817
death even life itself.

16:25.819 --> 16:30.088
The American Indians
did the same.

16:30.090 --> 16:32.190
I see this being an evangelist.

16:32.192 --> 16:35.560
I have many people coming
to me for counseling

16:35.562 --> 16:39.263
because they believe, once they
have moved to the United States

16:39.265 --> 16:43.735
and accepted the American
way of life, they believe now

16:43.737 --> 16:48.206
that they are worshiping
something that is evil.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.308
>> So you don't believe
it's evil?

16:50.310 --> 16:54.112
>> It's a religion
practiced by men.

16:54.114 --> 16:59.650
And I believe men are evil.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.621
>> Is Billy using voodoo?

17:03.623 --> 17:06.357
>> The rumor I've heard
for about a year or so.

17:06.358 --> 17:09.961
Now rumors are like
flash floods.

17:09.963 --> 17:13.531
They come quickly and die fast.

17:13.532 --> 17:18.736
But the truth -- the
truth is patient and stays

17:18.738 --> 17:19.936
around for the long haul.

17:19.939 --> 17:22.240
>> I like you, man.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.307
You a good man.

17:23.309 --> 17:26.877
You in the right
profession too, baby.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.180
>> You don't respect
the profession.

17:29.182 --> 17:32.283
>> I respect the hustle and
there's a hustle in everything.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.819
I see you later.

17:34.821 --> 17:37.455
>> Hey, you stay cool, man.

18:29.541 --> 18:33.411
>> You're acting as though
this is your first time.

18:33.413 --> 18:35.580
>> Let me tell you something.

18:35.582 --> 18:39.217
Nobody can get used
to this place.

18:39.219 --> 18:42.487
This place looks like a morgue.

18:47.026 --> 18:48.226
>> Bad old bill.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.627
You can't be scared.

18:49.629 --> 18:56.000
>> Look, I come here for one
thing and one thing only,

18:56.002 --> 18:57.935
so I'll just cut the bullshit.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.504
>> Don't move.

19:57.229 --> 20:02.833
I get the impression you
cannot be by yourself.

20:02.835 --> 20:07.171
You must love yourself in
order to be by yourself.

20:08.540 --> 20:12.944
>> Yeah, thanks for
the psychic bullshit.

20:12.946 --> 20:16.747
>> This will not work if you
don't believe it will work.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.483
This is a test of
your heart, Billy.

20:25.291 --> 20:30.861
Enter into the comfort
of my light.

20:30.863 --> 20:36.000
Breathe in the winds of these
candles, for this light is

20:36.002 --> 20:38.002
for the protection
of your servant.

20:38.004 --> 20:44.408
Choosing this light means
you close to my bosom.

20:44.410 --> 20:49.647
Choosing this light
brings you close my womb.

20:49.649 --> 20:53.484
Having this light surround
you brings you protection.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.262
Protection on the left.

21:04.264 --> 21:09.367
Protection on the right.

21:20.579 --> 21:29.220
Walk in this space
of hollow darkness.

21:31.223 --> 21:39.463
In this space you
shall find my flesh.

22:00.018 --> 22:03.487
>> Dirty girl, throw
sand in my fucking shoes.

22:53.038 --> 22:54.638
>> It's me.

22:54.640 --> 22:59.844
>> Fafa? Don't sneak
up on me like that.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.579
I will murder you.

23:01.581 --> 23:06.350
>> I'm so sorry, Billy

23:06.352 --> 23:07.318
>> what you want?

23:07.320 --> 23:08.352
What you doing here?

23:08.354 --> 23:08.786
>> Nothing.

23:08.788 --> 23:09.920
>> Nothing?

23:09.922 --> 23:12.623
You better make sure you
come here for something.

23:12.625 --> 23:16.327
>> Oh, I came to
tell you something.

23:16.329 --> 23:20.598
Albemarle say he want
to meet with you.

23:20.600 --> 23:22.366
>> What? Why?

23:22.368 --> 23:24.201
>> I don't know.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.636
>> So how do you know?

23:25.638 --> 23:27.104
>> Two of his boys told me.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.205
>> Which two boys?

23:28.207 --> 23:31.542
>> Corn and somebody
else, I didn't know him.

23:31.544 --> 23:32.977
>> Them told you what they want?

23:32.979 --> 23:35.513
>> They just wanted
me to tell you that.

23:53.031 --> 23:57.501
>> Yo, lock the door
behind you on your way out.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.479
>> Get out!

25:15.481 --> 25:18.849
Leave me the fuck alone!

25:18.851 --> 25:22.553
Get the fuck out of my house!

25:22.555 --> 25:30.461
>> Crème de la crème
from my head to my feet.

25:30.463 --> 25:36.333
Might as well piss glitter
cause I'm so sparkly.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.401
Bling.

25:37.403 --> 25:39.770
>> I hear you.

25:39.772 --> 25:41.071
Chris, yes...

25:41.073 --> 25:42.273
I said yes.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.774
>> Chris, Chris.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.143
>> A man was found by
his wife in this house

25:46.145 --> 25:49.346
with a three inch nail
lodged in his forehead.

25:49.348 --> 25:52.116
The strange part about it is
he didn't know it was there

25:52.118 --> 25:54.785
and continue working with
the gun in his basement.

25:54.787 --> 25:56.687
Now, after the initial shock --

25:56.689 --> 25:57.488
>> I went home.

25:57.490 --> 25:58.355
I tried to rest.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.024
I couldn't sleep.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.860
>> Chris, Chris, listen to me.

26:02.862 --> 26:04.628
Chris, listen to me.

26:04.630 --> 26:05.829
Chris, Chris.

26:05.831 --> 26:11.035
Shut up! I don't want you
around any of my stores.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.070
I don't want you
around any of my people

26:13.072 --> 26:14.605
and I don't want you around me.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.140
Do you understand?

26:16.142 --> 26:17.508
You hear me?

26:17.510 --> 26:18.842
Thank you.

26:18.844 --> 26:22.079
Bye. He's fucking stupid.

26:22.081 --> 26:23.847
He just gets out
and wants to work.

26:23.849 --> 26:25.215
>> He's never been in
any trouble before.

26:25.217 --> 26:26.283
He's nervous.

26:26.285 --> 26:29.687
>> I don't need any
more bad luck, okay?

26:29.689 --> 26:31.555
Wait a minute.

26:31.557 --> 26:34.124
I sent you two out on the
street to find out about Billy.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.326
What happened?

26:35.328 --> 26:37.828
>> We got nothing boss.

26:37.830 --> 26:41.599
Well, there is one thing.

26:43.268 --> 26:44.234
>> One thing, what?

26:44.236 --> 26:46.503
>> The dude is using
voodoo, boss.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.475
>> I sent you out on the
street and you come back

26:51.477 --> 26:52.676
with some dumb shit like this.

26:52.678 --> 26:53.777
I ought to throw you the fuck

26:53.779 --> 26:55.412
out of my house for
that stupid shit.

26:55.414 --> 26:56.714
>> The shit is real, man.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.681
Trevor, tell him.

26:57.683 --> 26:59.216
>> Get the fuck outta here, man.

26:59.218 --> 27:02.286
>> Tell him, trev.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.487
>> Well, it didn't
go down like that.

27:03.489 --> 27:04.355
>> Well, how did it go down?

27:04.357 --> 27:05.556
Tell me.

27:05.558 --> 27:06.757
>> I mean nobody says
that he's is doing voodoo

27:06.759 --> 27:07.992
but it just keeps coming up.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.793
>> Well, what are they saying?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.095
>> Listen.

27:11.097 --> 27:14.264
Nobody knows about him shitting
on us, but everybody seems

27:14.266 --> 27:17.134
to know something about
voodoo, blackheart.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.071
I mean I can write a
fuckin thesis on it now.

27:21.073 --> 27:24.708
>> So, you come back and now you
believe in the boogieman, right?

27:24.710 --> 27:28.045
>> No, I'm just telling you
what the streets is saying.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.947
>> Do me a favor
both of you all.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.548
Just get the fuck out, okay?

27:31.550 --> 27:33.350
>> So boss, tell us
what you want us to do.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.952
>> No, I don't want
you to do nothing.

27:34.954 --> 27:37.354
Okay? I'll take care
of it myself.

27:37.356 --> 27:39.590
I sent you out there to find
out what the hell is going on

27:39.592 --> 27:41.158
and you came back
with this dumb shit

27:41.160 --> 27:43.861
about Billy is decapitating
chickens

27:43.863 --> 27:45.162
and skinning fucking cats.

27:45.164 --> 27:47.297
Nothing. I'll do it myself.

27:47.299 --> 27:49.433
Just get the fuck
out, all right?

27:49.435 --> 27:50.834
Go on. No, no do me a favor.

27:50.836 --> 27:53.003
Find out if he's fucking flies
with toothpicks or something,

27:53.005 --> 27:54.204
get the fuck outta here.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.039
>> Boss, you serious?

27:55.041 --> 27:58.175
>> Get the outta here!

27:58.177 --> 28:01.845
And don't put you damn
shoes on in my house

28:01.847 --> 28:03.514
until you get down stairs.

28:20.165 --> 28:24.768
>> Ma'am, it's not in your
future to get married.

28:24.770 --> 28:29.273
Okay? To really change your
future you must first re-assess

28:29.275 --> 28:30.240
your present life.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.709
>> And what kind
of change can I do?

28:31.711 --> 28:35.512
>> Well, like I tell
every customer --

29:02.474 --> 29:05.375
>> where's your manners, Billy?

29:05.377 --> 29:10.948
It's rude to ignore
someone in a meeting.

29:10.950 --> 29:13.684
>> There comes a time in
every individual's lives

29:13.686 --> 29:15.352
when they know the
decision that they're

29:15.354 --> 29:17.721
about to make will
change everything now

29:17.723 --> 29:20.057
and everything else
in the future.

29:20.059 --> 29:21.859
Albamarle has come
to that point,

29:21.861 --> 29:24.928
and his decision is
all based on the vibe

29:24.930 --> 29:30.934
that he receives from Billy.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.369
>> I keep my word too.

29:32.371 --> 29:36.306
>> You moving in
on my shit, Billy?

29:36.308 --> 29:38.842
What they say is true?

29:38.844 --> 29:43.247
You killing chickens?

29:43.249 --> 29:44.081
>> Why you here?

29:44.083 --> 29:46.784
>> And in this particular case,

29:46.786 --> 29:49.853
he finds himself having
no Patience for it.

29:49.855 --> 29:52.489
He just wants to murder
that motherfucker now.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.597
Strange thing about
confidence; It doesn't matter

30:00.599 --> 30:05.202
who you were before, what's
your foe, how strong he is.

30:05.204 --> 30:08.605
The bottom line is, he knows
he's challenging someone totally

30:08.607 --> 30:12.509
different from before.

30:12.511 --> 30:14.745
>> You must be killing chickens.

30:14.747 --> 30:17.815
I never knew you to
have any fucking balls.

30:21.419 --> 30:23.554
>> And being the foe to Billy,

30:23.556 --> 30:28.192
albamarle now knows Billy
is not what he used to be.

30:28.194 --> 30:31.962
His confidence is gigantic.

30:31.964 --> 30:33.363
>> Fuck.

30:41.040 --> 30:43.507
>> Why? Because we've been
doing it since the slave ships.

30:43.509 --> 30:45.008
We came over here
on the slave ships

30:45.010 --> 30:46.777
and we've been doing
it ever since.

30:46.779 --> 30:50.347
Okay? You have to understand us.

30:50.349 --> 30:54.384
My mother passed it down to
me, her mother before her.

30:54.386 --> 30:56.620
My father passed it
down to me ass well.

30:56.622 --> 30:58.155
We are a long line

30:58.157 --> 31:01.959
of fortunetellers,
soothsayers, healers.

31:01.961 --> 31:03.727

kind of an issue,

31:03.729 --> 31:07.998
some kind of extreme problem
that you cant get fixed,

31:50.276 --> 31:53.343

I want to speak to

33:37.015 --> 33:38.482

34:03.541 --> 34:05.409
>> This sir --

34:05.411 --> 34:07.511

34:08.579 --> 34:09.913
No one else is here but us.

34:09.915 --> 34:15.284
>> I am not here for any
of your fucking sessions.

34:15.286 --> 34:17.420
>> You're not here
for a session?

34:19.489 --> 34:20.724
Mr. Charlie sent you?

34:20.726 --> 34:22.125
Cause tell Mr. Charlie i
don't have the money yet,

34:22.127 --> 34:23.994

34:23.996 --> 34:28.098
>> What the fuck are
you talking about?

34:28.100 --> 34:30.567
>> Mr. Charlie didn't send you?

34:30.569 --> 34:34.304
>> So far I'm not impressed
with your physic ability.

34:34.306 --> 34:38.608
Do I look like one of Mr.
Charlie's niggas to you?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.277
>> Never mind.

34:45.083 --> 34:46.016
We spoke yesterday?

34:46.018 --> 34:49.052
>> Yes nigga, we
spoke yesterday.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.889
>> You want answers.

34:52.891 --> 34:54.623
What's your question?

34:58.596 --> 34:59.329
>> What are you?

34:59.331 --> 35:01.631
>> What do you mean?

35:02.700 --> 35:08.071
Oh, and I'm going to
need that thousand.

35:09.307 --> 35:12.676
>> You'll get your money
as soon as I get my answers

35:12.678 --> 35:14.111
to the questions I want.

35:14.113 --> 35:15.212
>> Being a psychic?

35:15.214 --> 35:16.947
>> I'm asking the
fucking questions.

35:16.949 --> 35:17.814
>> I'm a psychic.

35:17.816 --> 35:21.751
>> Is this shit real?

35:22.687 --> 35:23.954
I know you say it's real.

35:23.956 --> 35:28.492
I know they say it's real
on TV, but I need to know.

35:29.694 --> 35:33.563
They say a lot of shit
on TV is that's not real.

35:33.565 --> 35:35.031
Is this real?

35:37.869 --> 35:40.170
>> Yes, of course.

35:40.172 --> 35:42.205
You want to cross someone?

35:43.474 --> 35:46.076
You want one of those fine
little honeys to love you?

35:46.078 --> 35:49.079
I can do anything except
put money into you pocket.

35:49.081 --> 35:54.017
>> You can do that?

35:54.019 --> 35:54.918
>> Yes and more

35:54.920 --> 35:58.889
>> I'm going to pay you.

35:58.891 --> 36:01.658
But first I need
answers to my questions.

36:04.162 --> 36:04.961
>> Sit.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.130
>> I am not fucking sitting.

36:09.400 --> 36:13.370
But if you take my money and
don't answer my questions,

36:13.372 --> 36:22.312
you'll wish Mr. Charlie
did send his boys for you.

36:27.285 --> 36:29.352
>> Give me your hand.

36:33.524 --> 36:37.260
>> Okay, we can skip that part.

36:38.963 --> 36:40.697
What do you need?

36:40.699 --> 36:42.399
>> I got a friend.

36:44.268 --> 36:47.537
I need to know if he's
using black magic.

36:47.539 --> 36:50.373
>> Someone put a hex on
you and you want it off.

36:50.375 --> 36:55.478
>> I need to know if this
friend of mine is using voodoo.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.082
>> That's it.

37:00.184 --> 37:03.653
>> Don't underestimate
what I'm asking you.

37:03.655 --> 37:05.055
>> Good ,good, good.

37:05.057 --> 37:08.225
Psychics can sense
other psychics.

37:08.227 --> 37:14.631
That's good but sir, I am a
psychic not a fortuneteller.

37:14.633 --> 37:19.302
So as you would say, who the
fuck are you talking about?

37:19.304 --> 37:21.771
>> His name is Billy fungus.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.840
We had a deal.

37:23.842 --> 37:26.142
We had a deal not to go to war.

37:26.144 --> 37:29.412
We had a deal to act
like businessmen.

37:29.414 --> 37:31.514
We had a deal to be
straight with each other

37:31.516 --> 37:32.549
and now he's breaking

37:32.551 --> 37:35.518
that fucking deal by
using this voodoo.

37:35.520 --> 37:39.456
It may not be breaking it to
some but he's breaking it to me.

37:39.458 --> 37:46.830
So I need to know, one, is
Billy fungus is using voodoo?

37:46.832 --> 37:52.269
Two, is this shit is as
real as you say you are?

37:52.271 --> 37:58.174
And three, I need to know
who the fuck is helping him.

37:58.176 --> 38:00.043
>> How do I get paid?

38:02.213 --> 38:07.183
>> I asked you three questions.

38:08.786 --> 38:12.155
You get five thousand
dollars for each answer.

38:12.157 --> 38:18.461
You play your cards right you
could walk away with fifteen gs.

38:18.463 --> 38:24.267
>> I can get your answers.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.573
>> Next week.

38:30.575 --> 38:34.511
This time.

38:47.058 --> 38:48.458
>> What the fuck is that?

38:48.460 --> 38:52.495
>> This is for your protection.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.932
Take it.

38:55.934 --> 38:58.068
>> You've seen my protection.

38:58.070 --> 39:02.706
>> I'm sorry but spirits cannot
be killed by guns, take it.

39:10.247 --> 39:11.514
Natural herbs.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.322
>> I'll be back next week.

39:19.324 --> 39:22.225
Make sure you have the answers.

39:22.227 --> 39:23.493
>> Next week.

39:54.024 --> 39:56.526
>> So what do you think?

39:56.528 --> 39:58.561
>> You know you're digging
your own grave messing

39:58.563 --> 39:59.963
with this dude, right?

39:59.965 --> 40:01.498
He's not supposed
to be fucked with.

40:01.500 --> 40:02.599
>> Why not?

40:02.601 --> 40:04.267
>> Son I know this
guy, he's a gangster.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.769
You he's not supposed
to be fucked with.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.505
>> Man, for fifteen g's
I'll fuck with Jesus Christ.

40:08.507 --> 40:11.040
>> Son if you fuck him
like everybody else,

40:11.042 --> 40:12.675
you ain't gonna live to collect.

40:12.677 --> 40:16.579
>> Look a sucker
is born every day

40:16.581 --> 40:19.949
and that my friend is a sucker.

40:19.951 --> 40:22.385
Him and Billy fungus, all right.

40:22.387 --> 40:26.489
We put them together we're
gonna be making double paper.

40:32.063 --> 40:33.630
>> What was you doing
up there so long?

40:33.632 --> 40:35.231
>> None of your fucking
business.

40:35.233 --> 40:36.599
>> I'm just saying.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.368
>> Well, don't say anything.

40:38.370 --> 40:42.338
>> So you just not telling us.

40:42.340 --> 40:43.540
>> He saw the black heart, man.

40:43.542 --> 40:44.441
>> No way, man.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.508
>> How the fuck?

40:45.510 --> 40:47.243
>> Say it isn't so, man.

40:47.245 --> 40:52.749
>> I got to find
out what they know.

40:52.751 --> 40:54.217
I got to find out if
this shit is true or not.

40:54.219 --> 40:55.852
>> It's not!

40:55.854 --> 40:57.787
>> Well, I've got to
find that out for myself.

40:57.789 --> 40:59.289
>> What the fuck do
you want to learn?

40:59.291 --> 41:01.324
How to pull a rabbits
out of a hat?

41:01.326 --> 41:03.460
>> I've got to know
what Billy knows.

41:03.462 --> 41:04.727
>> What if he is?

41:04.729 --> 41:07.063
It's not real!

41:07.065 --> 41:08.364
>> Suppose it is.

41:08.366 --> 41:11.301
>> What the fuck has
gotten into you, man?

41:11.303 --> 41:13.236
>> I've got to learn
this for myself.

41:13.238 --> 41:14.771
If it's true then we need it.

41:14.773 --> 41:16.506
We can use it to compete.

41:16.508 --> 41:17.774
>> Compete!

41:17.776 --> 41:19.142
Man, fuck competing.

41:19.144 --> 41:21.845
If we've got a problem let's
just kill these motherfuckers,

41:21.847 --> 41:22.479
man.

41:22.481 --> 41:25.348
>> We may have to.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.717
>> That's what it's
going to come down to.

41:27.719 --> 41:29.319
>> What the hell is that smell?

41:29.321 --> 41:30.720
You guys smell that?

41:30.722 --> 41:32.088
>> Yeah, what the fuck is that?

41:32.090 --> 41:34.390
>> Yeah, he gave me this.

41:34.392 --> 41:37.393
Put it away

41:37.395 --> 41:40.063

get rid of this, man.

41:40.065 --> 41:42.932
>> Just put it in the
glove compartment!

41:42.934 --> 41:46.236
Trevor, drive.

41:46.238 --> 41:52.709
>> So we find Billy fungus's
reader, albamarle goes in

41:52.711 --> 41:55.912

Billy's reader then we making

41:55.914 --> 41:58.381

41:58.383 --> 42:00.817
>> But he don't believe
in this shit, b.

42:00.819 --> 42:02.785
>> If he didn't believe,
why would he take the pouch?

42:02.787 --> 42:04.420
>> What pouch?

42:04.422 --> 42:08.191
>> Man, I took a sock, put
some herbs in it, shook it up,

42:08.193 --> 42:10.660
told him it was for
his own protection.

42:11.796 --> 42:14.697
>> A sock full of herbs?

42:14.699 --> 42:17.967
>> Sock full of herbs, baby.

42:59.110 --> 43:01.544
Thought you wasn't
getting back in the game.

43:01.546 --> 43:02.211
>> I'm not.

What the fuck you want?

43:08.086 --> 43:09.118
>> That's why you're a survivor.

43:09.120 --> 43:12.221
You got them good instincts.

43:12.223 --> 43:20.530
>> Yeah, the fucking spidey
sense is off the charts.

43:20.532 --> 43:24.033
What the fuck is up?

43:24.035 --> 43:26.536
>> Look I need your help.

43:26.538 --> 43:29.305
>> I don't have any money, i
gave it all to my baby's mother.

43:29.307 --> 43:32.408
>> I just need to ask you
something; Some information.

43:32.410 --> 43:36.646
>> Don't you come
here asking me shit.

43:36.648 --> 43:38.615
Brothers get popped
for information.

43:38.617 --> 43:39.816
>> It's a simple question.

43:39.818 --> 43:42.852
>> I don't care if it's
fucking two plus two,

43:42.854 --> 43:46.022
but you coming all the way
back here to ask me a question?

43:46.024 --> 43:47.190
That shit can't be simple.

43:47.192 --> 43:49.359
>> I just need to know
if you know anything

43:49.361 --> 43:50.293
about Billy using voodoo.

43:50.295 --> 43:52.128
>> I got to punch
you in the face.

43:52.130 --> 43:53.262
>> What? Why?

43:53.264 --> 43:54.597
>> I don't know what the
fuck you're involved in

43:54.599 --> 43:56.065
but you come here, in front
of those niggas over there,

43:56.067 --> 43:57.634
and try to involve me?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.435
>> They don't even know
what we're talking about.

43:59.437 --> 44:06.809
>> No, but now they think
we have a disagreement.

44:06.811 --> 44:07.710
So it's either i
punch you in the face

44:07.712 --> 44:08.511
or a bullet in your ass.

44:08.513 --> 44:09.479
>> Okay, hit me in the face.

44:35.005 --> 44:36.472
>> I got to make it stop.

44:36.474 --> 44:41.310
I'm gonna make it stop.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.945
>> You got to stop
seeing the witch.

44:42.947 --> 44:46.449
>> It might have been the weed.

44:46.451 --> 44:50.353
Maybe there's some coke
in it or something.

44:50.355 --> 44:54.023
>> You said the first time you
weren't smoking when you saw it.

44:54.025 --> 44:55.091
>> This is getting old.

44:55.093 --> 44:56.659
Billy coming in there
just raising hell

44:56.661 --> 45:00.463
and I'm suppose to take that.

45:42.206 --> 45:43.873
>> Shantel.

45:45.709 --> 45:46.476
Shantel.

45:58.088 --> 45:58.721

45:59.591 --> 46:03.726
>> Oh, quan baby, what's up?

46:03.728 --> 46:04.827

Come in. I'll take you
where you got to go.

46:06.231 --> 46:11.467
>> Good. These cabs won't
even stop for a nigga tonight.

46:11.469 --> 46:13.402
>> So you good?

46:13.404 --> 46:14.637
Oh man, girl.

46:14.639 --> 46:15.705

46:15.707 --> 46:18.307
What are you doing
around here this late?

46:18.309 --> 46:19.976
>> I was going to ask
you the same thing.

46:19.978 --> 46:21.978
You got a man around here?

46:21.980 --> 46:23.746
>> It's all about
the money, boo.

46:23.748 --> 46:27.383
You are going to
me home now, right?

46:27.385 --> 46:30.720
>> Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

46:30.722 --> 46:32.155
Where you live again?

46:32.157 --> 46:34.824
>> In crown heights, on bedford.

46:34.826 --> 46:37.860
Don't be acting like
you don't remember.

46:37.862 --> 46:40.296
>> No, no, no, I remember.

46:40.298 --> 46:44.534
You know, I use those
thoughts for special occasions.

46:44.536 --> 46:45.968
>> Yeah, I bet.

46:45.970 --> 46:48.304
But um let me ask you though.

46:48.306 --> 46:49.105
>> What's up?

46:49.107 --> 46:51.007
>> What's up with your face?

46:51.009 --> 46:53.242
Somebody hit you or something?

46:53.244 --> 47:01.184
>> This? No, I slipped and
i fell on like a stair post

47:01.186 --> 47:04.654
and I just missed there.

47:04.656 --> 47:05.588
>> Ok.

47:05.590 --> 47:07.356
>> I'm serious.

47:07.358 --> 47:09.091
So what about you?

47:09.093 --> 47:10.059
What you been up to?

47:10.061 --> 47:11.594
Looking bad as ever.

47:11.596 --> 47:14.864
>> Yeah, looking bad as ever is
what's getting me paid, baby.

47:14.866 --> 47:21.571
>> I bet. So you always
dancing at Billy's a lot?

47:21.573 --> 47:24.273
>> Yo I dance where the
dough is at, and the dough is

47:24.275 --> 47:26.242
at Billy's spot for real.

47:26.244 --> 47:28.811
That is a strip bar
up in here now.

47:28.813 --> 47:31.948
I was working at legs
up five times a week

47:31.950 --> 47:34.317
and doing the cashier
at pathmark.

47:34.319 --> 47:37.186
I'm over at Billy's spot three
times a week and nothing else

47:37.188 --> 47:39.589
and making the same
money in half the time.

47:39.591 --> 47:41.924
Bitches be hating on me.

47:41.926 --> 47:43.593
They wish they had my gig.

47:43.595 --> 47:44.927
>> You making that much?

47:44.929 --> 47:49.098
>> Nigga, I could buy you a
cab if I wanted to for real.

47:49.100 --> 47:50.132
>> Word.

47:50.134 --> 47:54.203
>> But I'm trying
to cut back though.

47:54.205 --> 47:55.271
Yeah, I'm trying to cut back

47:55.273 --> 47:57.840
to like once a week
something like that.

47:57.842 --> 48:00.776
I make rent in one day and
the rest of the money is

48:00.778 --> 48:03.512
for like my school shit
and my personal business.

48:03.514 --> 48:04.914
>> I can dig that.

48:04.916 --> 48:11.053
But sooner or later the
dude is going to get tired

48:11.055 --> 48:14.557
of you no matter
how bad you look.

48:16.159 --> 48:18.961
>> You know, look I know
the business, all right?

48:18.963 --> 48:20.997
You know what, the quicker i
get up outta there the better.

48:20.999 --> 48:23.466
Billy's got mad temper issues.

48:23.468 --> 48:24.901
One minute he cool,
the next he come

48:24.903 --> 48:26.936
in there straight
bugging on everybody.

48:26.938 --> 48:28.271
Watch he's gonna
walk up on that bitch

48:28.273 --> 48:29.472
and shoot that shit up one day.

48:29.474 --> 48:30.539
I'm telling you.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.807
I don't know what he's doing.

48:31.809 --> 48:33.276
I don't know if weed he's
smoking, I don't know

48:33.278 --> 48:34.944
if he's lacing that
shit with something,

48:34.946 --> 48:36.612
but the nigga be buggin.

48:36.614 --> 48:37.914
>> All right.

48:37.916 --> 48:40.683
>> You know, I heard he
got voodoo on his side.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.985
>> Yeah, I heard that too.

48:46.423 --> 48:46.956
>> So?

48:46.958 --> 48:51.127
>> So what?

48:51.129 --> 48:55.398
>> Do he got voodoo
working for him?

48:55.400 --> 48:56.999
>> No.

48:57.001 --> 48:59.669
>> No. Ain't that
what you just said?

48:59.671 --> 49:01.671
>> I just said I heard that.

49:01.673 --> 49:04.173
>> Well, what do
you think though?

49:04.175 --> 49:06.409
>> I think that nigga
Billy pays me

49:06.411 --> 49:09.312
and I also think I don't give
a fuck about nothing else.

49:09.314 --> 49:11.948
It's just haters
talking that's all.

49:11.950 --> 49:14.717
>> I know but that rumor
has been around for a while.

49:14.719 --> 49:16.452
>> Yo who cares?

49:16.454 --> 49:18.554
Don't nobody knows what
the hell is going on.

49:18.556 --> 49:21.557
The only person that
knows is Billy and god

49:21.559 --> 49:24.160
and probably his
retorted ass brother.

49:24.162 --> 49:25.561
>> He got a brother?

49:25.563 --> 49:29.131
>> Yeah, but he keeps that shit
quiet because that nigga has got

49:29.133 --> 49:33.436
like mental problems
or something.

49:33.438 --> 49:35.271
>> Who his brother though?

49:35.273 --> 49:37.573
>> The slow kid that
sells the cigarettes.

49:37.575 --> 49:38.140
Fafa.

49:38.142 --> 49:39.709
>> Fafa? Fafa.

49:39.711 --> 49:40.843
Fafa.

49:40.845 --> 49:44.714
>> Yeah, the slow guy
who sells cigarettes.

49:44.716 --> 49:49.518
Man, you is asking a whole
lot of questions tonight.

49:49.520 --> 49:55.191
You want to sit here all night?

49:55.193 --> 50:00.029
>> I'm coming with you.

50:00.031 --> 50:06.068
>> You must feel the energy
that will encompass your circle.

50:07.971 --> 50:09.038
>> Hold on.

50:09.040 --> 50:15.911
Can I put you on hold again?

50:15.913 --> 50:19.615
All right, hold on.

50:19.617 --> 50:20.816
Hello?

50:20.818 --> 50:21.784
>> Yo what's up?

50:21.786 --> 50:23.119
>> Who is this?

50:23.121 --> 50:24.320
>> Yo it's duran.

50:24.322 --> 50:28.324
>> Duran? You know I can't
talk to you right now.

50:28.326 --> 50:32.995
>> Sorry about yesterday but
you asking me about fucker.

50:32.997 --> 50:37.133
>> Yeah, but I couldn't
do that shit to you.

50:37.135 --> 50:38.901
Excuse me.

50:38.903 --> 50:44.673
We're having some
technical difficulty.

50:44.675 --> 50:46.609
>> To your dumbass question.

50:46.611 --> 50:49.745
My answer is that
i don't know shit

50:49.747 --> 50:54.283
but if you really want
to know ask booker.

50:54.285 --> 50:54.984
>> Booker?

50:54.986 --> 50:56.252
>> Booker, you know him.

50:56.254 --> 50:58.854
He calls himself sanctified.

50:58.856 --> 51:02.658
>> The thieving ass
nigga sanctified?

51:02.660 --> 51:03.859
>> The motherfucker
thief turned preacher.

51:03.861 --> 51:07.063
>> Why would he know anything?

51:08.765 --> 51:12.134
>> Nigga used to
steal with Billy.

51:12.136 --> 51:13.335
>> Word?

51:13.337 --> 51:14.804
>> Besides, who else would
know more than a crook

51:14.806 --> 51:16.939
who is now a thieving preacher?

51:16.941 --> 51:17.873
>> He would know
something, right?

51:17.875 --> 51:19.308
>> I don't fucking know.

51:19.310 --> 51:25.181
I'm just giving you
some information.

51:25.183 --> 51:34.223
If it work it work,
if it don't it don't.

51:35.225 --> 51:36.992
>> I got you.

51:36.994 --> 51:38.094
>> What the fuck yo?

51:38.096 --> 51:41.497
Stop taking personal
calls from your bitches

51:41.499 --> 51:42.298
when we're on the air.

51:42.300 --> 51:43.632
What happen to your eye?

51:43.634 --> 51:46.802
>> Yesterday, work
doing for your dumbass.

51:46.804 --> 51:49.038
>> You got fucked up?

51:49.040 --> 51:50.139
>> Not too bad.

51:50.141 --> 51:52.208
I got laid so is sort
of cancels shit out.

51:52.210 --> 51:53.676
>> Say word.

51:53.678 --> 51:54.310
>> Word.

51:54.312 --> 51:55.878
>> What happened?

51:55.880 --> 51:57.113
>> Two things.

51:57.115 --> 51:59.115
One, the dude that did this
to my face just called.

51:59.117 --> 51:59.949
And he said --

51:59.951 --> 52:02.084
>> the dude that fucked you up?

52:02.086 --> 52:02.785
>> Yeah.

52:02.787 --> 52:03.986
>> He called your phone.

52:03.988 --> 52:04.687
>> Yeah.

52:04.689 --> 52:06.388
>> And you picked up?

52:06.390 --> 52:08.958
>> Yes. You done?

52:08.960 --> 52:12.728
So we got to talking about
Billy fungus and I found

52:12.730 --> 52:15.397
out Billy has a retarded
brother who might know shit.

52:15.399 --> 52:16.999
>> All right, backup.

52:17.001 --> 52:18.601
Who do we need to talk to?

52:18.603 --> 52:20.202
>> Sanctified.

52:20.204 --> 52:22.171
>> Sanctified?

52:23.573 --> 52:25.274
I know that name from somewhere.

52:25.276 --> 52:26.175
>> Yup, this is it.

52:26.177 --> 52:28.310
>> Okay, stop right here.

52:28.312 --> 52:34.416
All right, I'll go
in by myself, okay.

52:34.418 --> 52:36.452
>> Um-hum.

53:09.153 --> 53:10.486
>> Who you?

53:10.488 --> 53:11.287
>> My name is artifice.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.522
>> I don't know no artifice.

53:13.524 --> 53:14.223
>> I need your help.

53:14.225 --> 53:17.259
>> What kind of help?

53:17.261 --> 53:19.461
>> I'm lost and need
to be found.

53:19.463 --> 53:21.864
>> Well, we're closed
right now, brother.

53:21.866 --> 53:22.831
Come on back tomorrow.

53:22.833 --> 53:24.967
>> This is very important.

53:24.969 --> 53:28.003
>> Brother, it's
always important.

53:28.005 --> 53:29.538
>> I'll pay you.

53:35.112 --> 53:36.445
>> Come on in, man.

53:36.447 --> 53:39.048
I can always use the extra
money for the renovation.

53:39.050 --> 53:41.984
I was just about to
turn this place over.

53:41.986 --> 53:45.654
>> Better to start before
the morning catches you.

53:45.656 --> 53:47.356
>> Very right.

53:47.358 --> 53:52.161
So you're lost and
need to be found?

53:52.163 --> 53:54.029
>> Yes and no.

53:54.031 --> 53:56.365
>> Yes and no.

53:56.367 --> 53:58.667
How can they both be?

53:58.669 --> 54:01.003
>> I heard you used to
run with Billy fungus?

54:01.005 --> 54:02.771
>> Is that what this is about?

54:02.773 --> 54:05.441
>> I just need a
little information.

54:05.443 --> 54:07.009
>> I don't remember
much about those days.

54:07.011 --> 54:11.347
>> Okay, I understand you
don't want to talk much

54:11.349 --> 54:14.316
about Billy especially to
someone you don't know,

54:15.252 --> 54:16.785
but I just need a little help.

54:16.787 --> 54:18.254
>> You know correctly, brother.

54:18.256 --> 54:21.390
I'm not in the streets anymore.

54:21.392 --> 54:23.292
That was a different life.

54:23.294 --> 54:24.260
Different memories.

54:24.262 --> 54:26.562
I don't like to relive them.

54:26.564 --> 54:28.297
Keep your money.

54:29.366 --> 54:35.104
>> You don't understand.

54:35.106 --> 54:36.038
I need your help.

54:36.040 --> 54:42.344
>> So how do you
suppose I can help?

54:42.346 --> 54:45.447
>> I need to know --

54:45.449 --> 54:47.449
>> if Billy is using
black magic?

54:47.451 --> 54:48.550
>> Yes.

54:48.552 --> 54:51.120
>> And if he is, is it for real?

54:51.122 --> 54:52.121
>> Yes.

54:52.123 --> 54:53.889
>> You are barking
up the wrong tree.

54:53.891 --> 54:55.424
>> But you have heard though?

54:55.426 --> 54:57.826
>> What does that mean?

54:57.828 --> 55:02.097
>> You're not in the
streets anymore, right?

55:02.099 --> 55:04.133
>> I'm in the church.

55:04.135 --> 55:12.775
>> Okay, let me tell
you how I see it.

55:12.777 --> 55:15.511
You tell me if I'm wrong.

55:15.513 --> 55:19.448
>> Preach, brother.

55:19.450 --> 55:22.017
>> Servicing this neighborhood
as a spiritual leader,

55:22.019 --> 55:25.487
you must hear a lot
of extraordinary

55:25.489 --> 55:31.226
and unusual stories
from your parishioners.

55:33.263 --> 55:38.334
I mean, most of them are
from the Caribbean, you know,

55:38.336 --> 55:43.772
Jamaica, Haiti, some African.

55:45.608 --> 55:49.078
So that leads me to believe
that you are at the heart beat

55:49.080 --> 55:53.816
of the underground
spiritual world.

55:53.818 --> 55:57.653
So if there's rumors about Billy
fungus, then you would want

55:57.655 --> 55:58.821
to know if they're true or not.

55:58.823 --> 56:05.294
See we have a lot
in common you and I.

56:05.296 --> 56:10.165
You're a spiritual leader,
I'm a spiritual leader.

56:10.167 --> 56:13.669
People confide in us.

56:13.671 --> 56:21.176
So, if I was you and I heard
these things about Billy,

56:21.178 --> 56:28.350
my homeboy, I would want to
know if they're true or false.

56:28.352 --> 56:34.189
>> What kind of spiritual
man are you?

56:34.191 --> 56:39.495
>> I'm the kind that serves me.

56:39.497 --> 56:43.665
>> You said your
name is artifice?

56:43.667 --> 56:45.567
You know when I first
heard that my instinct was

56:45.569 --> 56:47.136
to leave you out there.

56:47.138 --> 56:52.841
What mother names her
black child artifice?

56:52.843 --> 56:55.377
Is that your given name boy?

56:55.379 --> 57:01.617
>> My name is artile but
people just call me artifice.

57:01.619 --> 57:05.521
I used to go to a performing
arts school in sixth grade.

57:05.523 --> 57:13.162
I had a teacher, Mrs. Allen, she
thought I was a great performer.

57:15.698 --> 57:16.432
She named me artifice.

57:16.434 --> 57:21.970
I guess it just stuck.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.405
>> Like you, stuck.

57:23.407 --> 57:27.409
Well, I don't think she
saw a great performer.

57:27.411 --> 57:30.879
>> No? No, well,
what did she see?

57:30.881 --> 57:34.550
>> She saw a cheat and a liar.

57:34.552 --> 57:41.023
Haven't you ever been curious
about the meaning of your name?

57:41.025 --> 57:42.124
>> You are talking
about my name?

57:42.126 --> 57:45.727
>> No, your name is not
a name, it's a noun.

57:45.729 --> 57:47.396
It's pronounced artifice.

57:47.398 --> 57:50.432
It means trick, ingenious.

57:50.434 --> 57:58.373
I don't think she saw a great
performer, great acting talent.

57:58.375 --> 58:02.311
She saw a wolf in sheep's
clothing, the devil's agent.

58:02.313 --> 58:06.448
Just like how you came
knocking at my door.

58:06.450 --> 58:11.353
>> You don't got both eyes?

58:11.355 --> 58:15.624
>> But I see you.

58:21.130 --> 58:24.900
>> Now enough with the bullshit.

58:24.902 --> 58:27.870
Is Billy using black magic?

58:27.872 --> 58:29.338
>> Yes, yes!

58:29.340 --> 58:31.440
>> Who the fuck is helping him?

58:31.442 --> 58:32.307
>> Clarence!

58:32.309 --> 58:33.609
Her name is Clarence!

58:33.611 --> 58:34.176
>> It's a she?

58:34.178 --> 58:34.810
Where she live?

58:34.812 --> 58:35.444
>> I don't know.

58:35.446 --> 58:37.346
In a house.

58:37.348 --> 58:38.480
>> In a house.

58:38.482 --> 58:41.250
What house?

58:41.252 --> 58:44.853
>> In a house on Putnam Avenue.

58:44.855 --> 58:49.291
>> In a house on Putnam Avenue?

58:49.293 --> 58:51.827
What's the number?

58:51.829 --> 58:55.097
>> She hasn't been
here in over a year.

58:55.099 --> 58:58.100
I don't know!

58:58.102 --> 59:00.536
>> Apologize for your rudeness.

59:28.531 --> 59:30.666
>> Go. Get out of here!

59:30.668 --> 59:32.334
>> What's the fuck happened?

59:32.336 --> 59:33.569
You have blood on you.

59:33.571 --> 59:35.237
Oh man, I'm done!

59:35.239 --> 59:39.041
I'm done with your shit.

59:45.515 --> 59:54.189
What the fuck?

59:54.191 --> 59:55.157
Oh, shit.

59:55.159 --> 59:59.194
>> I'm coming with you, man.

59:59.196 --> 01:00:00.362
>> No, stay here, man.

01:00:00.364 --> 01:00:09.004
>> We know what's up, man.

01:00:09.006 --> 01:00:11.373
I want to see this guy.

01:00:11.375 --> 01:00:11.940
>> Come on.

01:00:11.942 --> 01:00:13.075
>> This is it?

01:00:13.077 --> 01:00:15.611
>> No, I'm looking for a
new place to live, man.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.114
>> Come in.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:26.788
>> Boy, sit the fuck down.

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:37.065
Sit down!

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.034
What you got for me, man?

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.902
>> This is a closed session.

01:00:40.904 --> 01:00:42.638
One per session, not three.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.373
>> Well you got three
so deal with it.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.375
>> I'm not here for any session.

01:00:46.377 --> 01:00:49.311
I'm here for information
i wanted.

01:00:49.313 --> 01:00:51.246
>> Okay, fine.

01:00:51.248 --> 01:00:53.915
>> I want to know about Billy.

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:58.754
>> Billy fungus is using the
help of a spiritual reader.

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:01.590
>> I could have fucking
told you that, man!

01:01:01.592 --> 01:01:04.059
I could have told you that!

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:06.361
>> And who is the reader?

01:01:06.363 --> 01:01:07.796
>> It's a woman, a female.

01:01:07.798 --> 01:01:10.399
>> Who?

01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:12.968
>> Her name is Clarence.

01:01:12.970 --> 01:01:16.104
>> Clarence, that's the
bitch that cursed my father.

01:01:16.106 --> 01:01:19.107
>> And she's also the angel
from it's a wonderful life.

01:01:19.109 --> 01:01:21.476
Boss, I told you his
is some bullshit.

01:01:21.478 --> 01:01:25.380
>> You know, I like to
take people to the gym.

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:27.349
I like to inflict pain.

01:01:27.351 --> 01:01:30.786
>> Hey, it's true,
man, it's real.

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.287
>> Where can I find her?

01:01:32.289 --> 01:01:33.822
>> I don't know.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.826
>> What do you mean,
i don't know?

01:01:37.828 --> 01:01:39.461
>> I don't know where she lives.

01:01:39.463 --> 01:01:41.596
>> What good is the information?

01:01:41.598 --> 01:01:44.099
She could be somewhere
in Canada, boss.

01:01:44.101 --> 01:01:45.734
This information ain't
about no money, man.

01:01:45.736 --> 01:01:48.336
I told you this was
some bullshit.

01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.605
>> Come on.

01:01:50.607 --> 01:01:51.373
Lets go to the gym.

01:01:51.375 --> 01:01:52.741
>> She lives in bed-stuy.

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:55.944
If you want to speak to
her, you have to speak

01:01:55.946 --> 01:02:01.083
to the man who don't know much.

01:02:01.085 --> 01:02:03.752
>> Let's take him
to the gym, boss.

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:05.420
>> It's the truth.

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:06.955
His name is fafa, okay?

01:02:06.957 --> 01:02:08.457
His name is fafa.

01:02:08.459 --> 01:02:09.958
>> Fafa?

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:10.892
>> That's that dude from --

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:11.593
>> yeah.

01:02:11.595 --> 01:02:13.862
>> You know this guy?

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.530
>> Not really, just
a local dude,

01:02:15.532 --> 01:02:17.199
hustles cigarettes,
that's about it.

01:02:17.201 --> 01:02:19.735
>> And he knows this bitch?

01:02:19.737 --> 01:02:21.503
>> Yeah, he should.

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.239
>> Do I get my money?

01:02:24.241 --> 01:02:25.574
>> Fuck no!

01:02:25.576 --> 01:02:29.611
You lucky we don't get your
fucking ass whipped, phoney.

01:02:29.613 --> 01:02:34.850
You gonna really pay this nigga?

01:02:34.852 --> 01:02:36.384
>> I'll be back.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:46.962
For better or for
worse, I'll be back.

01:02:47.797 --> 01:02:49.498
>> Yeah, we will be back, man.

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:13.088
>> You really think we going
to find this nigga around here?

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.090
>> This is my best guess.

01:03:15.092 --> 01:03:16.958
It's better than
driving around aimlessly.

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.127
I don't han out in
the nineties no more,

01:03:19.129 --> 01:03:20.796
but I'll bet we'll
find him around here.

01:03:20.798 --> 01:03:23.999
>> So, what we going
to do, grab the nigga

01:03:24.001 --> 01:03:25.367
in front of all these niggas?

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:28.537
>> I thought you was
the badass motherfucker.

01:03:28.539 --> 01:03:32.307
>> I am. But I'm also smart.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:33.608
>> So, then what's the plan?

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:37.546
>> We can do that tough dumb
shit you're talking about.

01:03:37.548 --> 01:03:41.783
Look at all these
motherfucking Jamaicans,

01:03:41.785 --> 01:03:46.521
out here cooking chicken and
playing music late at night.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.323
>> You're a funny dude, man.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:52.460
How you gonna say some shit like
that when your name is Trevor?

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:57.499
>> What's that got
to do with anything?

01:04:04.174 --> 01:04:05.273
>> You bring the bag?

01:04:05.275 --> 01:04:06.508
>> All right.

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:34.656
>> Trev.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:35.323
>> Yeah.

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.524
>> That's him.

01:06:36.526 --> 01:06:39.561
>> It's that motherfucker
right over there.

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:43.465
>> Yeah, it is him.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.468
We're gonna grab him
and throw him right

01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:49.471
up in this motherfucking car.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:07:59.574
>> Yo trev, take it easy, man.

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:01.109
>> Calm the fuck down.

01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:03.278
>> I said calm the
fuck down, man.

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.946
>> Let me go.

01:08:04.948 --> 01:08:07.282
You're going to get in trouble.

01:08:07.284 --> 01:08:08.817
>> Relax or I'm gonna
hurt you, man.

01:08:08.819 --> 01:08:12.153
>> Get in trouble, you see
the position you are in?

01:08:12.155 --> 01:08:18.259
>> Trevor, take it
easy, fucking relax!

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:20.495
>> Junior, they took fafa.

01:08:20.497 --> 01:08:22.464
>> What?

01:08:55.264 --> 01:08:56.029
>> Yo, Billy.

01:08:56.032 --> 01:08:57.265
>> No.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.434
>> Billy! Billy!

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.268
Wake up!

01:09:00.270 --> 01:09:01.069
>> I'm okay.

01:09:01.071 --> 01:09:05.640
>> Billy, they took fafa!

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:08.276
>> What do you want?

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:11.279
>> Billy, listen to me.

01:09:11.281 --> 01:09:12.046
They kidnapped fafa.

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:14.983
They just kidnapped fafa.

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:16.317
>> Who?

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:20.488
>> I don't know but I bet it
was those niggas from waste.

01:09:20.490 --> 01:09:21.189
>> When?

01:09:21.191 --> 01:09:22.490
>> A man just called me.

01:09:22.492 --> 01:09:23.424
>> He saw it happen?

01:09:23.426 --> 01:09:27.295
He didn't he do anything?

01:09:27.296 --> 01:09:28.595
He just watched?

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:31.966
>> These are regular dudes.

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:34.469
They are not fungus.

01:09:34.470 --> 01:09:36.804
>> I don't care about fungus.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:40.542
That pussy must die.

01:09:58.727 --> 01:10:03.064
>> They just took fafa.

01:10:03.066 --> 01:10:05.333
>> Everyone out.

01:10:05.335 --> 01:10:12.307
Dee Jay, turn of
the fucking music!

01:10:12.309 --> 01:10:15.476
Get the fuck out.

01:10:15.478 --> 01:10:16.844
Party done.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:20.582
You two meet me outside.

01:10:34.530 --> 01:10:43.071
Yo pass me my war vest.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.539
Go find my brother outside.

01:11:29.051 --> 01:11:30.618
>> Where you bitches at?

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:31.352
>> We home.

01:11:31.354 --> 01:11:32.287
What's up?

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:33.488
>> I ain't been home
in a minute.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:36.257
I've been too busy
making that money.

01:11:36.259 --> 01:11:38.893
>> Girl you know that is right.

01:11:38.895 --> 01:11:40.194
>> I'm up in there with you all.

01:11:40.196 --> 01:11:43.665
>> I don't want to see you
doing that Turkey dance.

01:11:43.667 --> 01:11:45.867
>> You better stop.

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:49.537
You should see me shaking
that shit right now.

01:12:03.052 --> 01:12:04.319
>> What?

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.721
>> Don't play around, okay?

01:12:06.723 --> 01:12:12.927
Cause I'm taking out
my rollers, all right?

01:12:12.929 --> 01:12:14.262
>> Yo I'm coming.

01:12:14.264 --> 01:12:16.864
What the hell.

01:12:16.866 --> 01:12:20.735
Someone is knocking at my door.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:24.238
Let me call you back.

01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:24.872
I'm coming.

01:12:24.874 --> 01:12:25.473
>> Open the door.

01:12:25.475 --> 01:12:26.507
I see you.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.129
>> Why are you here?

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:49.931
>> We need to talk.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:51.632
>> It's past my bedtime.

01:12:51.634 --> 01:12:53.468
How about tomorrow?

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:57.905
>> Now! We have to
talk right fucking now.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:13:04.645
I don't remember
you being this tall?

01:13:04.647 --> 01:13:05.580
>> Why are you here?

01:13:05.582 --> 01:13:07.982
>> You have to correct
some shit.

01:13:07.984 --> 01:13:09.450
>> What's wrong?

01:13:09.452 --> 01:13:13.354
>> Shit's not right,
that's what's wrong.

01:13:13.356 --> 01:13:14.555
>> What happened?

01:13:14.557 --> 01:13:15.757
>> They took my brother.

01:13:15.759 --> 01:13:16.190
Fix it.

01:13:16.192 --> 01:13:16.958
>> How?

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.725
>> What do you mean, how.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:18.693
You have to fix that!

01:13:18.695 --> 01:13:22.196
>> That's now how it works.

01:13:22.198 --> 01:13:24.232
>> Does it works like this?

01:13:24.234 --> 01:13:30.138
>> Put it away, Billy.

01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:34.342
How dare you desecrate
my home with this weapon?

01:13:34.344 --> 01:13:36.944
>> You better tell me something

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:42.950
or I'll desecrate
more than this home.

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:45.653
>> Put it away.

01:13:45.655 --> 01:13:47.622
>> For all the money I pay you.

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:50.558
You better tell me something
good or I'll murder you.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:53.528
>> You have to listen to me.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:55.663
>> No politics.

01:13:55.665 --> 01:13:58.232
>> You have to trust
what I say if you want

01:13:58.234 --> 01:14:00.234
to see your brother safe.

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:04.572
>> Trust? Billy fungus
doesn't trust nobody.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:05.973
>> You're protected.

01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:07.241
He will be protected.

01:14:07.243 --> 01:14:10.278
You have to have faith.

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:15.516
If not, his fate will rest
in the hands of others.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:19.640
>> Take this.

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:20.741
>> What's this?

01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:24.245
>> Protection until
you regain your faith.

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:25.613
>> I need more than this.

01:16:25.615 --> 01:16:28.583
I need to know where he is.

01:16:28.585 --> 01:16:30.251
>> I can't help you with that.

01:16:30.253 --> 01:16:32.153
You've been through
the ceremony.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:33.788
The spirits they know you.

01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:38.960
You have to have faith in
order to have good fortune.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:41.762
You have to have faith, Billy.

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:47.635
>> I had faith before but i
know you're trying to get me.

01:16:47.637 --> 01:16:54.909
Those spirits are
coming to get me.

01:16:54.911 --> 01:16:58.579
>> Don't you go crazy
in my house.

01:16:58.581 --> 01:17:01.349
You have to remember that
nothing in life goes smooth.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:05.486
Life has trials.

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:07.922
This may be one of them.

01:17:07.924 --> 01:17:11.225
You need faith to get
you through the trials.

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:12.827
>> I have faith.

01:17:12.829 --> 01:17:21.902
But if they hurt my brother,
I'll put you in a fucking box.

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:31.012
Remember that.

01:17:31.014 --> 01:17:32.413
>> That's it, I'm done.

01:17:32.415 --> 01:17:37.952
I'm packing my shit and
getting the hell outta here.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:43.724
>> We need to find fafa fast
because albamarle is know

01:17:43.726 --> 01:17:46.827
to tortured people, so we need

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:55.903
to find fafa right
now, like right now.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:58.873
>> Now let me see.

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:00.775
It's not my birthday.

01:18:02.277 --> 01:18:04.278
It's not Christmas.

01:18:08.150 --> 01:18:11.552
Corn I got a Jamaican
pinata here.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:13.788
>> Fafa, you don't have
to go through this.

01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:14.822
Just tell him what
he wants to know.

01:18:14.824 --> 01:18:15.756
The man is fucking serious.

01:18:15.758 --> 01:18:18.059
>> Corn, shut the fuck up.

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:24.365
He's just trying to save my
soul from eternal damnation.

01:18:26.268 --> 01:18:27.268
He just don't want
me to go to hell

01:18:27.270 --> 01:18:29.670
for what I'm about to do to you.

01:18:29.672 --> 01:18:32.873
>> Some fuckboy came
by here a couple

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:35.176
of days ago asking questions.

01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:35.876
>> Who?

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:37.144
>> You got to ask duran.

01:18:37.146 --> 01:18:38.879
>> Dude came by asking questions
and duran fucked him up.

01:18:38.881 --> 01:18:40.281
I wanted a piece of that too.

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:42.016
>> Where are we gonna duran?

01:18:42.018 --> 01:18:43.784
>> He probably up in his crib.

01:18:43.786 --> 01:18:47.755
He don't work late.

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:52.727
>> You got something I want.

01:18:52.729 --> 01:19:00.901
You're going to give it to me.

01:19:00.903 --> 01:19:07.441
You're going to give
me sooner later,

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:13.047
but you going to give it to me.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:16.383
Well, look what they gave me.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:20.321
They gave me a whole tray full
with goodies for you, man.

01:19:20.323 --> 01:19:30.097
I'm going to ask you one time.

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:34.535
Where does that bitch live?

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:37.772
>> I'm no snitch.

01:19:37.774 --> 01:19:39.940
>> You tell him, man.

01:19:39.942 --> 01:19:41.642
You don't tell that guy nothing.

01:19:41.644 --> 01:19:42.910
You right.

01:19:42.912 --> 01:19:44.912
Let the games begin.

01:19:44.914 --> 01:19:53.621
You represent the Jamaican team
and I represent the u.S of a.

01:19:53.623 --> 01:19:56.290
>> We got an event going.

01:19:56.292 --> 01:20:05.366
>> Come on, man.

01:20:28.990 --> 01:20:40.401
>> Who that?

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:47.775
>> Junior.

01:20:53.048 --> 01:20:57.051
>> Who is that?

01:20:57.053 --> 01:21:03.657
>> Yo what the fuck do you want?

01:21:03.659 --> 01:21:06.393
>> I don't have no time, duran.

01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:15.469
>> I don't like when nigga's
randomly coming to my house.

01:21:21.276 --> 01:21:24.044
>> Open the door.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.146
>> What's up?

01:21:28.950 --> 01:21:32.152
>> You got heavy and came down.

01:21:32.154 --> 01:21:35.923
We heard you fucked up a dude
that asked you questions.

01:21:35.925 --> 01:21:43.631
>> Whatever you want
i don't know anything.

01:21:43.633 --> 01:21:48.402
>> You don't even know what
i want and you starting

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:50.237
with you, don't know anything.

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:50.871
>> Listen to me.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:52.006
I don't know shit.

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:54.375
>> We go way back
but I'll treat you

01:21:54.377 --> 01:21:56.010
like a hostile motherfucking
witness

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:59.013
if you don't start cooperating.

01:21:59.015 --> 01:22:01.548
>> What's going on down there?

01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.516
Is everything all right?

01:22:02.518 --> 01:22:05.319
>> Get back upstairs.

01:22:05.321 --> 01:22:07.855
I'll be there in a minute.

01:22:07.857 --> 01:22:10.824
>> I'm still waiting, man.

01:22:10.826 --> 01:22:13.460
>> It was a nigga'
named shaquan.

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:16.563
Used to work the corners.

01:22:16.565 --> 01:22:18.132
He came at me asking
about Billy.

01:22:18.134 --> 01:22:19.500
>> What did he ask about Billy?

01:22:19.502 --> 01:22:21.835
>> Nigga asked if
Billy was using voodoo.

01:22:21.837 --> 01:22:27.841
I told him not to come
at me with questions,

01:22:27.843 --> 01:22:30.344
especially dumb shit like that.

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:31.312
>> Where can I find him?

01:22:31.314 --> 01:22:35.182
>> Fuck that no snitching shit.

01:22:35.184 --> 01:22:44.258
Where can I find him?

01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:51.832
>> 232 Carol street.

01:22:51.834 --> 01:22:57.538
>> 232 Carol street.

01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:59.139
>> Yeah, take the back door.

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:00.341
>> You sure?

01:23:00.343 --> 01:23:04.211
I don't want to fuckin'
come back here being given

01:23:04.213 --> 01:23:07.081
bad information.

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.516
>> And what you going to do?

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:10.884
>> Don't go anywhere.

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:11.719
>> It's like that?

01:23:11.721 --> 01:23:16.056
>> That's mother fucking right

01:23:16.058 --> 01:23:19.126
>> it's due time to x you out.

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.461
>> All talk.

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:22.262
>> Duran?

01:23:22.264 --> 01:23:22.963
>> I'm coming.

01:23:22.965 --> 01:23:25.933
>> Wake the fuck up!

01:23:25.935 --> 01:23:30.237
Wake the fuck up!

01:23:30.239 --> 01:23:39.279
The score is Jamaica
one u.S two.

01:23:42.083 --> 01:23:50.157
The u.S wants the gold.

01:23:50.159 --> 01:23:59.233
>> Don't move and be calm.

01:24:04.839 --> 01:24:13.914
Who and you are here?

01:24:28.830 --> 01:24:33.033
>> We got it!

01:24:33.035 --> 01:24:34.001
>> Lets go.

01:24:34.003 --> 01:24:34.835
>> Since you so concern
about fafa,

01:24:34.837 --> 01:24:36.503
you stay here and baby-sit him.

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:39.299
>> Who the fuck is this?

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.067
>> This, here is shaquan.

01:25:40.069 --> 01:25:43.837
Shaquan meet Billy.

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:45.739
>> Uh, how you doing?

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:47.307
>> How am I doing?

01:25:47.309 --> 01:25:48.742
How am I doing?

01:25:48.744 --> 01:25:52.913
>> I'm going to let
shaquan take it from here

01:25:52.915 --> 01:25:55.382
because he knows everything.

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:59.653
Tell him where you're taking us.

01:26:00.722 --> 01:26:03.090
>> Um, to artifice's house.

01:26:03.092 --> 01:26:04.558
>> Why are we going
to artifice house?

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.527
>> Because he might
know where fafa is.

01:26:06.529 --> 01:26:09.329
>> And why would he
know where fafa is?

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:12.966
>> Artifice knows because
albamarle hired him

01:26:12.968 --> 01:26:16.637
as his spiritual advisor.

01:26:16.639 --> 01:26:19.573
>> Artifice is an obeah worker.

01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:22.209
Albamarle hired him because they
believe you have an obeah man

01:26:22.211 --> 01:26:23.544
working for you.

01:26:23.546 --> 01:26:26.180
>> But why take fafa?

01:26:26.182 --> 01:26:29.316
>> To find out where
your obeah worker is.

01:26:29.318 --> 01:26:31.518
They feel fafa knows.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.253
And, shaquan here know artifice.

01:26:33.255 --> 01:26:36.490
>> No, artifice did it.

01:26:36.492 --> 01:26:41.862
I don't work with him anymore.

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:44.665
>> Oh and sactified is dead,

01:26:44.667 --> 01:26:48.468
because these nigga's
killed him.

01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:52.506
>> Get the fuck out of here!

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:58.045
>> That's the house over there?

01:26:58.047 --> 01:26:58.879
>> Yup, right there.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:00.180
>> I can't wait five minutes.

01:27:00.182 --> 01:27:02.749
I can't wait.

01:27:02.751 --> 01:27:06.486
I need a cab at my
door right now.

01:27:28.276 --> 01:27:37.417
>> Go the around, man.

01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:42.489
Fucking assholes.

01:28:43.352 --> 01:28:53.460
>> Shut up.

01:28:53.462 --> 01:28:59.032
>> Shut up.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:09.076
Shut up.

01:29:09.078 --> 01:29:10.477
>> That was fun.

01:29:10.479 --> 01:29:12.512
Been a while since
I've done that.

01:29:12.514 --> 01:29:15.449
Now you better give me what
i need before I have some

01:29:15.451 --> 01:29:16.283
more fun.

01:29:16.285 --> 01:29:20.053
>> Okay, what do you want?

01:29:20.055 --> 01:29:21.188
>> Correct answers.

01:29:21.190 --> 01:29:26.860
I know you know them,
so I'm gonna test you.

01:29:26.862 --> 01:29:29.796
Lend me you fire arm.

01:29:29.798 --> 01:29:35.802
I'll show you to
play with things.

01:29:35.804 --> 01:29:38.405
Who am I? Who am I?

01:29:38.407 --> 01:29:40.907
>> Billy fungus.

01:29:40.909 --> 01:29:43.543
>> And why are we here?

01:29:43.545 --> 01:29:46.046
>> I don't know!

01:29:46.048 --> 01:29:47.114
>> Okay, okay.

01:29:47.116 --> 01:29:50.584
Look. To try to find
out about albamarle?

01:29:50.586 --> 01:29:51.651
>> Good. Good.

01:29:51.653 --> 01:29:54.855
>> I don't know about him, man.

01:29:54.857 --> 01:29:57.758
I don't know him, okay?

01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.725
I'm not real.

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:01.762
I'm not a real psychic.

01:30:01.764 --> 01:30:04.865
>> The man is a counterfeit.

01:30:04.867 --> 01:30:07.667
>> He came in here and he
started talking about --

01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:13.073
>> a whole lot of money if
i helped him with his luck.

01:30:14.409 --> 01:30:17.844
He wanted to control
his own destiny.

01:30:19.714 --> 01:30:23.950
>> But he made a ton of money
since he started seeing you.

01:30:23.952 --> 01:30:26.319
>> That has nothing
to do with me.

01:30:26.321 --> 01:30:27.554
>> No?

01:30:29.157 --> 01:30:32.659
>> All I did was
burn some candles

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:35.429
and say a few words
that sounded good.

01:30:35.431 --> 01:30:40.667
>> So you didn't do shit
and he still made out.

01:30:40.669 --> 01:30:42.602
Is that what you're saying?

01:30:42.604 --> 01:30:43.570
>> I guess.

01:30:43.572 --> 01:30:44.838
>> The reasons don't
fucking matter.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:46.206
Where the fuck is fafa!?

01:30:46.208 --> 01:30:48.442
>> I don't know.

01:30:48.444 --> 01:30:50.444
Okay, wait.

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:55.582
They said they were going
to take him to the gym.

01:30:55.584 --> 01:30:56.216
>> The gym?

01:30:56.218 --> 01:30:57.684
>> Yeah, the gym.

01:30:57.686 --> 01:30:58.885
>> Okay, the gym.

01:30:58.887 --> 01:31:07.828
>> You soul can be
cleansed and pristine.

01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:09.095
Brother Jenkins, give us a song.

01:31:09.097 --> 01:31:11.665
Bring us home.

01:31:11.667 --> 01:31:14.167
>> Ain't that a motherfucker.

01:31:14.169 --> 01:31:17.904
>> I kept it going because
it built his confidence.

01:31:17.906 --> 01:31:20.874
It didn't matter if it worked.

01:31:20.876 --> 01:31:22.776
It worked for him.

01:31:22.778 --> 01:31:27.214
The more confident,
the bolder he became.

01:31:27.216 --> 01:31:30.917
The bolder, the more
money he made.

01:31:30.919 --> 01:31:34.688
The more he wanted, the more
he made, the more I made.

01:31:34.690 --> 01:31:39.526
Look, I may not be real
but I ain't stupid!

01:31:39.528 --> 01:31:43.396
>> I told you it was
a bunch of bullshit.

01:31:43.398 --> 01:31:52.472
Her and artifice ain't nothing
bu some con artists, man.

01:31:53.307 --> 01:31:58.445
>> Ain't that a motherfucker.

01:31:58.447 --> 01:32:01.781
>> Wait! I have some money.

01:32:01.783 --> 01:32:04.217
I'll give you some.

01:32:10.057 --> 01:32:11.525
>> Go get it.

01:33:17.525 --> 01:33:18.325
>> Corn.

01:33:18.327 --> 01:33:19.426
>> Yo.

01:33:19.428 --> 01:33:24.397
>> We're on our way
back to the gym, man.

01:33:30.705 --> 01:33:32.973
Get fafa ready.

01:33:32.975 --> 01:33:33.907
>> All right.

01:33:33.909 --> 01:33:35.609
Got you.

01:33:35.611 --> 01:33:37.077
>> All right.

01:33:37.079 --> 01:33:38.712
>> Chic, thought she
was saving her money.

01:33:38.714 --> 01:33:40.513
She didn't know she
was saving your money.

01:34:37.204 --> 01:34:41.341
>> That looks like albamarle.

01:34:41.343 --> 01:34:41.941
>> You sure.

01:34:41.943 --> 01:34:44.244
That is them.

01:34:47.081 --> 01:34:53.887
>> Looks like we got company.

01:34:53.889 --> 01:34:56.690
>> What the fuck?

01:34:56.692 --> 01:34:59.559
Taxi drivers running
up in my house now.

01:34:59.561 --> 01:35:00.460
Never mind.

01:35:00.462 --> 01:35:01.594
Grab this bag, give me a minute.

01:35:01.596 --> 01:35:02.529
I have one more thing to get.

01:35:02.531 --> 01:35:04.064
>> Hold up.

01:35:04.066 --> 01:35:05.865
I'm not here for this.

01:35:05.867 --> 01:35:08.935
>> Why we running, we
should be chasing them.

01:35:08.937 --> 01:35:11.504
>> What the fuck
you mean we running?

01:35:11.506 --> 01:35:12.772
You're the one driving.

01:35:12.774 --> 01:35:14.307
>> Okay, lets end this shit.

01:35:14.309 --> 01:35:16.609
Turn and stop at the dead end.

01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:17.377
>> Follow them.

01:35:17.379 --> 01:35:18.411
Anywhere they go we go.

01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:20.780
>> You may not remember me,

01:35:20.782 --> 01:35:25.919
but you may remember

My old boyfriend Angus?

01:35:30.025 --> 01:35:35.895
Wait who the fuck is you?

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:39.733
>> I'm the one you said you
feel sorry for remember?

01:35:39.735 --> 01:35:45.605
>> What the fucking

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.507
Oh.

01:35:47.509 --> 01:36:00.386
>> I thought you
were light skin.

01:36:01.355 --> 01:36:10.430
You know redbone.

01:36:17.471 --> 01:36:21.608
>> Get him off of me.

01:36:21.610 --> 01:36:23.777
He's trying to kill me.

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.545

01:36:44.566 --> 01:36:45.698
Are you crazy?

01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.866
Who are you?

01:36:46.868 --> 01:36:48.268
>> Billy's brother.

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:52.338
>> So you're just
going to stand there

01:36:52.340 --> 01:36:53.907
and watch while i
choke her to death?

01:36:53.909 --> 01:36:59.179
>> I don't care how you
kill her just killer.

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:04.751
>> So what do you do now?

01:37:04.753 --> 01:37:07.520
>> One of us dies.

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:20.520
>> Son of a bitch!

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:50.650
>> Yo where's my brother?

01:39:50.652 --> 01:39:56.522
>> Billy. Billy, I'm going
to give you one chance

01:39:56.524 --> 01:39:59.125
to settle this like
you got some sense.

01:39:59.127 --> 01:40:03.529
Right here, right now.

01:40:03.531 --> 01:40:04.364
Now!

01:40:04.366 --> 01:40:07.333
>> What's up with this pussy?

01:40:07.335 --> 01:40:08.101
>> No.

01:40:08.103 --> 01:40:10.003
>> Let go talk to them.

01:40:10.005 --> 01:40:13.706
>> Put your gun away.

01:40:13.708 --> 01:40:17.243
Billy, I'm surprised at you.

01:40:17.245 --> 01:40:20.913
You know I'm going to have
to hurt you for this, right?

01:40:20.915 --> 01:40:24.083
>> Hurt? In a minute
you will be a ghost.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.421
>> Those are harsh words, Billy.

01:40:28.423 --> 01:40:30.156
>> Where is my brother?

01:40:30.158 --> 01:40:36.562
>> Billy, how the hell
am I supposed to know

01:40:36.564 --> 01:40:37.430
where your brother is?

01:40:37.432 --> 01:40:40.366
>> Stop telling lies.

01:40:40.368 --> 01:40:44.670
We know you took the man.

01:40:44.672 --> 01:40:49.142
>> Billy, control your bitches.

01:40:49.144 --> 01:40:52.178
>> What's up homeboy?

01:40:52.180 --> 01:40:52.712
>> Drive, man!

01:40:52.714 --> 01:40:54.247
Drive, man!

01:40:54.249 --> 01:40:56.249
>> Yo man, this is
just a dollar cab.

01:40:56.251 --> 01:40:57.450
It's just a dollar cab.

01:40:57.452 --> 01:41:01.254
>> This is going to get
as ugly as your brother

01:41:01.256 --> 01:41:02.955
if you don't back off.

01:41:02.957 --> 01:41:06.459
You hear me?

01:41:06.461 --> 01:41:07.560
>> Fafa?

01:41:07.562 --> 01:41:08.694
>> Where are you Billy?

01:41:08.696 --> 01:41:09.328
>> That's fafa?

01:41:09.330 --> 01:41:11.531
Give me the phone!

01:41:11.533 --> 01:41:13.933
>> Where are you, Billy?

01:41:13.935 --> 01:41:17.103
>> Slow down, man, slow down.

01:41:17.105 --> 01:41:18.938
We're at the church on Liberty.

01:41:18.940 --> 01:41:23.242
Go home, just go to your house.

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:28.514
>> You see, Billy, you see?

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:30.716
I told you I didn't
have your brother.

01:41:30.718 --> 01:41:38.124
Now you owe me an
apology don't you, Billy?

01:41:38.126 --> 01:41:39.258
>> What you have in your hand.

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.993
Bring your hand up front
let me see what you have

01:41:40.995 --> 01:41:41.694
in your had, man.

01:41:41.696 --> 01:41:42.428
Show me you hand.

01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:48.067
Put your hand up front.

01:41:48.069 --> 01:41:48.868
>> What hand, Billy?

01:41:48.870 --> 01:41:49.702
What are you talking about?

01:41:49.704 --> 01:41:53.606
>> The hand you have behind you.

01:41:56.743 --> 01:41:57.743
>> Are you a cop now, Billy?

01:41:57.745 --> 01:42:01.180
You want to know
what's in my hands.

01:42:02.282 --> 01:42:04.217
It's my handkerchief, Billy.

01:42:06.487 --> 01:42:08.154
It's what I blow my nose in.

01:42:08.156 --> 01:42:09.589
>> What you got there?

01:42:09.591 --> 01:42:10.756
A grenade?

01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:13.593
>> Yeah, it's a hand
grenade, Billy.

01:42:13.595 --> 01:42:17.830
Very intelligent
it's a hand grenade.

01:42:17.832 --> 01:42:19.665
What's that you got
in you fucking hand?

01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:20.900
Is that a hand grenade too?

01:42:20.902 --> 01:42:27.874
>> Both of you are using voodoo?

01:42:27.876 --> 01:42:30.243
>> I don't do any
fucking voodoo, okay.

01:42:30.245 --> 01:42:32.612
Voodoo is phony.

01:42:32.614 --> 01:42:34.814
Ask your bitch about the voodoo.

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:38.084
What's so damn funny, Billy?

01:42:38.086 --> 01:42:40.553
It's funny, ha?

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:02.074
Well what do know?

01:43:02.076 --> 01:43:04.544
>> It works.

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.555
>> Billy! Billy!
