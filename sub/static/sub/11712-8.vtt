There's no need, Mr. Russell.

18:44.498 --> 18:47.543
Your plan worked.
I'm going home.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.753
Ah, yeah, my plan.
What plan was that?

18:49.753 --> 18:53.507
Your plan to teach me
what's really important in life

18:53.507 --> 18:54.466
by showing me an existence

18:54.466 --> 18:57.469
so empty
and devoid of meaning.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.265
Yeah. You figured
that one out, did you?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.058
How could I not?

19:03.058 --> 19:06.102
I mean, obviously no one
lives a life that shallow.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.103
[CHUCKLES]

19:07.103 --> 19:08.730
Obviously.

19:08.730 --> 19:10.065
Thank you again
for showing me

19:10.065 --> 19:13.026
the depths of depravity--
Yeah, yeah. No, no, we got it.

19:13.026 --> 19:14.278
All right, so you gotta
get running.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.988
So you gotta scram.
He's gotta hayride, I think so--

19:16.988 --> 19:19.991
Come on, Toby. We'll take you
to the bus station.

19:19.991 --> 19:21.034
Okay.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.494
Bye, Mr. Russell.
Yeah.

19:22.494 --> 19:25.831
Now that I'm leaving you can
resume living your real life.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.750
Yeah, oh, yeah.

19:29.543 --> 19:33.464
Oh, yeah. Can't wait
to get back to that.

19:33.464 --> 19:35.174
[SIGHS]

19:35.174 --> 19:37.634
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

19:38.260 --> 19:39.553
Hey, mama,
how you feeling?

19:39.553 --> 19:40.971
Oh, good,
you got the basket.

19:40.971 --> 19:45.309
Uh, yeah, listen, guys.
I have to tell you something.

19:45.309 --> 19:48.562
See, the-- The truth is,
I should return that to you

19:48.562 --> 19:52.441
because, uh, I'm not pregnant.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.609
See what happened was--

19:53.609 --> 19:55.068
Oh, you don't have
to say it.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.738
And you know
it's totally normal.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.240
You just need
to keep trying.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.116
Oh, no. No, no, no, see--

20:01.116 --> 20:04.035
No, look. Just take a couple
of days off.

20:04.035 --> 20:04.786
Okay?

20:04.786 --> 20:08.582
Oh, I don't...

20:08.582 --> 20:11.001
Maybe that would be best.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.299
Oh.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.679
[♪♪♪♪♪♪]

20:24.931 --> 20:28.435
Oh, my God, your outfit
is so cute.

20:28.435 --> 20:31.897
Mm, I've never met
an Amish guy before.

20:32.063 --> 20:35.651
Yes, I am innocent
to your big city ways,

20:35.651 --> 20:39.696
and I have only
my Rumspringa to experience

20:39.696 --> 20:43.199
the carnal joys of modern life.

20:43.199 --> 20:44.618
Wait, Rumspringa?

20:44.618 --> 20:46.537
Isn't that for,
like, teenagers?

20:46.537 --> 20:48.289
Yes, it is.

20:48.289 --> 20:51.082
Wow, you look
much older than that.

20:51.082 --> 20:53.919
Yes, it's a hard life
on the farm.

20:53.919 --> 20:57.923
Hey, can I get a vodka tonic,
no ice? Thank you.

20:57.923 --> 21:00.717
Tell me, thy belly button,

21:00.717 --> 21:04.263
wouldst they be
an innie or outie?

21:04.263 --> 21:05.722
