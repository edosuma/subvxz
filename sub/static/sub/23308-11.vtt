00:06.813 --> 00:08.266
<i>Previously on</i>
"The Magicians"...

00:08.336 --> 00:11.516
No magic means no more
idiotic Earth rulers,

00:11.585 --> 00:13.214
and I get my kingdom back.

00:13.285 --> 00:17.118
We are gonna hunt down
every last living slaver,

00:17.187 --> 00:20.129
<i>and hang them
by their own entrails.</i>

00:21.565 --> 00:23.346
What does Jane have
to do with The Beast?

00:23.415 --> 00:26.085
Ember gave her the ability
to create a time loop.

00:26.154 --> 00:27.157
A time loop.

00:27.226 --> 00:28.877
So far, all the loops
ends in your death.

00:28.946 --> 00:30.154
How many times
have I died?

00:30.238 --> 00:32.896
39...
the Alice from the 23rd timeline

00:32.965 --> 00:35.130
was the sole survivor of
The Beast.

00:35.199 --> 00:37.161
- We need to talk to her.
- Well, you can't.

00:37.256 --> 00:38.863
<i>Well, what about
a Tesla Flexion?</i>

00:38.932 --> 00:41.667
I'm from another timeline.
We only have two minutes.

00:41.746 --> 00:43.382
I thought I'd never see
you again.

00:43.486 --> 00:44.995
The Beast, he...
he tore you apart,

00:45.072 --> 00:47.088
piece by piece,
but not just your body,

00:47.157 --> 00:49.170
but your...
your Shade, everything.

00:49.239 --> 00:52.005
Oh! I have sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy.

00:52.111 --> 00:53.147
It's totally curable.

00:53.224 --> 00:56.457
- There is no actual cure.
- A silver bullet.

00:56.713 --> 00:58.590
These are my students,
they are in need

00:58.659 --> 00:59.813
of the Rhinemann Ultra.

00:59.881 --> 01:02.887
No one but you can be within
20 feet of the blast...

01:03.710 --> 01:05.881
<i>It will kill anyone
including your Beast.</i>

01:07.393 --> 01:09.786
So, you wanna tell me where you
hooked up with your partner?

01:09.855 --> 01:10.858
Fillory.

01:10.927 --> 01:12.788
If he smells you again,
he won't show.

01:12.857 --> 01:14.481
If you want him,

01:14.550 --> 01:16.522
<i>you might just have
to risk losing your base.</i>

01:16.591 --> 01:19.920
You and your companions
are on a quest for seven keys?

01:20.015 --> 01:21.336
- Yes.
- We have

01:21.405 --> 01:23.029
one of the keys
in the Fairy Realm.

01:23.098 --> 01:25.157
Without the key,
everything collapses,

01:25.226 --> 01:27.515
which is why we can
never give it to you.

01:28.700 --> 01:31.370
I don't know what they think
is going on with my nose.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.857
Yeah, and those are not my teeth.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.001
And only 1,000 Fillorian
gold crescents for us?

01:36.080 --> 01:38.173
Tick is cheap.
It'll be his downfall.

01:38.242 --> 01:40.083
- I'll kill him.
- Who you gonna kill?

01:40.180 --> 01:41.668
That dick, Tick Pickwick.

01:41.737 --> 01:43.964
Your incursion
into the throne room

01:44.033 --> 01:45.594
put that cheapskate
on red alert.

01:45.663 --> 01:46.911
Wait, we're on there too?

01:46.980 --> 01:48.732
You're
Kings and Queens of Fillory,

01:48.801 --> 01:50.361
so you're
a threat to his reign.

01:50.430 --> 01:52.729
Yeah, well, so was Josh.
I don't see his face on there.

01:52.806 --> 01:55.559
He was more like a substitute
teacher, didn't count.

01:55.636 --> 01:57.690
We got news... Julia sent a bunny.

01:58.106 --> 02:00.869
Apparently, her and the Fairy
Queen are on good terms now.

02:00.941 --> 02:02.369
Fucking what?

02:02.504 --> 02:04.284
<i>Hold on, so, on Earth,</i>

02:04.403 --> 02:07.362
the fairies are slaves,
and the Fairy Queen is...

02:07.431 --> 02:10.386
- A good guy, kind of?
- Uh-uh, you know what?

02:10.669 --> 02:11.932
Fuck Tinkerbitch.

02:12.009 --> 02:13.764
Fuck her right in the Egg McMuffin.

02:13.835 --> 02:17.047
Guys, we need Tinkerbitch's
help to get the Sixth Key.

02:17.124 --> 02:19.930
Unfortunately,
she's as helpful as pubic lice.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.211
Right, which is why
we should talk to Julia

02:22.280 --> 02:25.220
- and I think we should do it in person.
- Sorry, but we're all wanted,

02:25.289 --> 02:28.503
and Tick's just stepped up the
patrols around the portal tree.

02:28.572 --> 02:31.146
Why don't we just send one of us?
It'll be easier to break through.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.329
- I'll do it.
- You can't.

02:32.398 --> 02:34.407
Tick wants your head,
says so right there.

02:34.476 --> 02:37.274
Have you guys tried
this Fillorian salami?

02:37.367 --> 02:38.914
It doesn't taste like horse...

02:44.616 --> 02:45.646
What?

02:45.736 --> 02:47.617
<i>Jesus, fuck.</i>

02:48.103 --> 02:49.611
I'm...

02:50.000 --> 02:51.860
I'm much too sober
for all this.

02:51.949 --> 02:53.814
Yeah, well, you have to hear it.

02:53.967 --> 02:56.523
A lot of the McAllisters are dead,
but Irene is still out there,

02:56.639 --> 02:58.239
and I don't know what she's going to do.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.583
Slavery,
mass murder...

03:00.757 --> 03:04.594
and yet,
it smells so floral in here.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.724
Lucier's cleaning charm.

03:06.827 --> 03:09.004
Next time, try less rosewater.

03:09.348 --> 03:11.730
Any idea about
how to deal with Irene,

03:12.303 --> 03:14.484
who will doubtless
want her property back?

03:14.561 --> 03:16.774
Well, she'll have to find it first.

03:17.005 --> 03:18.935
Did you poke out her eyes?

03:19.132 --> 03:20.222
No.

03:20.381 --> 03:23.143
I replaced all the wards
and shields around Brakebills.

03:23.220 --> 03:25.227
You did what? By yourself?

03:25.385 --> 03:26.685
That's impossible.

03:26.793 --> 03:28.445
That's apparently what I can do now.

03:28.514 --> 03:29.938
My magic's been growing,

03:30.007 --> 03:32.656
maybe because I helped
free all those fairies.

03:34.158 --> 03:36.414
This is new territory for me.

03:36.546 --> 03:37.933
Me too.

03:38.002 --> 03:40.665
Well, look, the school's
yours again, if you want it.

03:40.842 --> 03:42.444
Sober up.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.068
'Sup.

03:48.950 --> 03:51.804
So, the Fairy Queen
can't give us the Sixth Key.

03:52.351 --> 03:54.513
The Fairy Realm
will collapse without it.

03:54.656 --> 03:57.753
Well, that blows.

03:58.470 --> 04:01.116
Honestly, my instructions
ended at talk to Julia.

04:01.192 --> 04:04.197
So what are we supposed to do now?

04:06.895 --> 04:08.382
Uhh...

04:08.523 --> 04:10.934
How did we end up at Burning Man?

04:11.414 --> 04:13.217
We're inside a Tesla Flexion.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.358
Is that a car?

04:14.435 --> 04:17.100
A device that allows you to
communicate across timelines.

04:17.188 --> 04:20.072
Like, alternate universes-type shit?

04:20.231 --> 04:22.615
Like alternate universes-type shit.

04:22.828 --> 04:24.568
- Don't touch anything.
- Copy that.

04:24.637 --> 04:26.861
Usual paradox/explosion
problems?

04:26.930 --> 04:28.731
Someone cast this
to pull us inside.

04:28.815 --> 04:30.702
We just
need to find out who.

04:33.368 --> 04:35.556
Thank God, it worked.

04:43.207 --> 04:47.101
<font color=#FF00FF>*THE MAGICIANS*</font>
<font color=#00FF00>Season 03   Episode 11</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Twenty-Three"</font>

04:47.545 --> 04:50.382
Holy mirror universes,
Batman.

04:50.541 --> 04:52.001
It's me.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.174
Like, you're me...

04:54.243 --> 04:56.294
Okay, calm your shit.
I'm from a different timeline.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.997
You're in a Tesla Flexion,
we only have...

04:58.065 --> 04:59.419
Two minutes.
We know the rules.

04:59.550 --> 05:02.323
Right. Of course. You pulled
Alice into one of these before.

05:02.392 --> 05:04.065
Wait, you're from
that same timeline?

05:04.134 --> 05:05.454
That's right.
Look, we need your help.

05:05.522 --> 05:07.373
There's this monster here
killing Magicians.

05:07.442 --> 05:09.192
- We call him The Beast.
- 12 fingers?

05:09.261 --> 05:10.550
Cloud of moths
around his face?

05:10.619 --> 05:13.589
Yeah, I tried to get people to
call him Mothra... didn't stick.

05:13.658 --> 05:16.895
Here either, can't expect everyone
to be down with the Kaiju classics.

05:16.964 --> 05:18.608
Okay, guys,
two minutes, right?

05:18.685 --> 05:20.890
Right, uh, problem is,
magic vanished.

05:20.961 --> 05:22.424
These plumber guys
showed up one day

05:22.493 --> 05:24.218
- and just...
- Shut it off like a faucet.

05:24.672 --> 05:27.255
Here, too. But you
guys have no idea why?

05:27.342 --> 05:28.972
No clue,
except the problem is,

05:29.041 --> 05:30.924
we lost magic,
but The Beast didn't.

05:31.035 --> 05:32.473
He was suddenly
unstoppable.

05:32.800 --> 05:34.971
I-I-I-I don't understand. Uh.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.980
So magic is gone, but then
how does he still have it?

05:38.049 --> 05:39.317
Dude, I don't know.

05:39.386 --> 05:41.714
Maybe it has something to do
with this key around his neck.

05:41.783 --> 05:43.159
Wait, what key?

05:43.276 --> 05:44.631
About yea big.

05:44.708 --> 05:46.790
Rumor is, it gives him
visions of the future.

05:46.861 --> 05:49.227
Visions of the future...
none of our keys do that.

05:49.296 --> 05:50.978
Look, Julia, in my timeline,

05:51.047 --> 05:52.869
you were the best student
Brakebills ever had

05:52.938 --> 05:54.474
until you were horribly murdered.

05:54.543 --> 05:56.031
- Oh.
- But with your help,

05:56.100 --> 05:57.796
we might stand a chance
against Mothra.

05:57.865 --> 06:00.304
And Josh, well,
you're me.

06:00.390 --> 06:02.020
No argument there.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.898
Shit, uh, please...
you have to find a way back here.

06:04.967 --> 06:06.264
This is our most
desperate hour.

06:06.333 --> 06:09.337
Help us, Julia and Josh.
You're our only hope.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.476
Ended on a "Star Wars"
reference?

06:17.545 --> 06:19.993
He really knew how to get to me.
We're his new hope.

06:20.062 --> 06:22.209
All I'm saying is,
can we even trust him?

06:22.278 --> 06:24.919
Of course we can trust him.
It's me.

06:24.988 --> 06:26.739
I would know if I was lying.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.773
You said we can't get the Sixth Key,
and visions of the future?

06:29.842 --> 06:31.313
That has to be the seventh.

06:31.442 --> 06:33.117
Any reason
we gotta do this in order?

06:33.196 --> 06:34.314
I don't know.

06:34.391 --> 06:36.358
Up until now,
the book told us where to go,

06:36.532 --> 06:38.848
we got a key, and then
the book gave us a clue

06:38.917 --> 06:41.929
- about where to find the next one.
- Well, maybe this time, we flip it.

06:42.318 --> 06:44.236
The key quest has been
Q's thing.

06:44.305 --> 06:46.225
I've been trying to
figure out my own magic.

06:46.297 --> 06:48.874
Listen, I say we take
this problem back to him,

06:48.943 --> 06:50.920
and see what he and the others
have to say about it.

06:50.988 --> 06:53.632
Fine, but I will freely admit
I was getting excited

06:53.701 --> 06:56.237
at the idea of
a Josh-Julia solo adventure.

06:56.406 --> 06:57.593
Sorry.

06:57.698 --> 06:59.423
Yeah, what would
the shippers even call us?

06:59.526 --> 07:02.611
Josh? Julia?
See?

07:02.680 --> 07:04.551
You couldn't even tell that
I swapped the first letters.

07:04.619 --> 07:05.719
Nope.

07:12.136 --> 07:14.215
Where's the portal?

07:14.433 --> 07:16.338
What happened?

07:16.407 --> 07:18.933
The time key sent us to the lab.

07:19.108 --> 07:21.384
Not our lab.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.727
This place is a wreck.

07:22.879 --> 07:25.523
Damn,
that was fast.

07:27.247 --> 07:29.041
We're in Timeline 23.

07:29.304 --> 07:30.947
Act out.

07:33.962 --> 07:35.466
This doesn't make sense.

07:35.543 --> 07:37.459
The key was supposed
to take us to Fillory.

07:37.528 --> 07:39.779
It just decided to send us back here?

07:39.848 --> 07:41.246
What even are the rules?

07:41.358 --> 07:43.724
Beats me...
they're weirdly inconsistent.

07:43.835 --> 07:46.718
I guess we have some shit
to take care of in Timeline 23,

07:46.795 --> 07:48.706
maybe key-related.

07:48.880 --> 07:50.703
It worked!
They're here!

07:54.309 --> 07:55.330
Marina?

07:55.400 --> 07:57.024
Holy shit.

07:57.127 --> 07:58.859
Wait, you know her?

07:58.954 --> 08:01.450
Of course I do,
she was a year ahead of me,

08:01.519 --> 08:03.122
and hot, um...

08:03.199 --> 08:06.274
Okay,
I know you by reputation,

08:06.343 --> 08:08.136
but how do you know me?

08:08.361 --> 08:09.950
I don't know you here?

08:10.030 --> 08:11.172
No.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.988
You went to Brakebills,

08:13.057 --> 08:15.004
I'm a hedge witch,
we don't mix.

08:15.179 --> 08:17.172
So, what happened
in your timeline?

08:17.498 --> 08:20.248
Um, I didn't go to Brakebills,

08:20.675 --> 08:22.631
so we became friends.

08:22.901 --> 08:24.046
Friends?

08:24.258 --> 08:26.113
That does not sound like me.

08:26.190 --> 08:27.678
Wait, you didn't go to Brakebills?

08:27.747 --> 08:30.495
That's, like, Hermione Granger
not getting into Hogwarts.

08:30.614 --> 08:32.293
Alternate timeline shit is weird.

08:32.361 --> 08:33.366
Tell me about it.

08:33.434 --> 08:35.881
Why don't we go somewhere safer?
We can talk about all this.

08:37.964 --> 08:42.032
Jesus, place hasn't looked this
partied out since my first year.

08:42.285 --> 08:44.569
So, you guys have no idea
why magic went away here?

08:44.638 --> 08:46.177
No clue, how about in yours?

08:47.720 --> 08:49.452
A God was killed by a human.

08:49.531 --> 08:51.217
The Old Gods took it away as punishment.

08:51.312 --> 08:53.567
Bunch of Mount Olympus-sized dicks.

08:53.647 --> 08:56.233
And magic going out here was the
beginning of the end for us.

08:56.310 --> 08:58.036
That Beast started killing Magicians...

08:58.113 --> 08:59.928
first Brakebills,
then the hedge witches.

09:00.005 --> 09:01.942
So, we joined forces to survive.

09:02.347 --> 09:05.273
Wait, so if The Beast
is killing Magicians,

09:05.342 --> 09:07.948
is Brakebills really the safest
place for us to hang out?

09:08.017 --> 09:10.071
Oh, he hasn't been here
since the first massacre.

09:10.205 --> 09:11.555
Thinks everyone's dead.

09:11.624 --> 09:13.715
We have scoured
what's left of the place

09:13.784 --> 09:16.338
looking for away to defeat
that moth-faced cock-whistler.

09:16.407 --> 09:18.015
That's how
we found the Tesla Flexion,

09:18.084 --> 09:19.408
and a battery to cast it.

09:19.477 --> 09:21.017
And this sweet jacket.

09:21.143 --> 09:23.520
It's not magic,
but might as well be.

09:23.624 --> 09:27.641
Hey, speaking of magic,
we got some big news.

09:27.745 --> 09:29.221
Julia can...

09:29.452 --> 09:31.839
Uh, tell you about it herself.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.990
And it's not even...
it's not even big news.

09:34.059 --> 09:35.439
I don't know why I said that...

09:35.916 --> 09:38.106
Your Beast has some sort of key?

09:38.246 --> 09:39.369
Mm-hmm.

09:40.314 --> 09:41.398
We need it.

09:41.705 --> 09:43.704
You help us kill our Beast,

09:44.444 --> 09:45.969
key is yours.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.315
Deal.

09:47.432 --> 09:48.457
Boom.

09:48.526 --> 09:50.211
Let's celebrate, bitches...

09:50.616 --> 09:52.094
Powerful women.

09:53.216 --> 09:54.747
So, Marina, huh?

09:54.816 --> 09:57.028
You know,
I've always had a crush on her.

09:57.298 --> 09:58.339
I know.

09:58.433 --> 10:00.345
Oh, right...

10:01.167 --> 10:02.570
Hey, what happened to
the glasses?

10:02.639 --> 10:03.894
Lasik.

10:04.442 --> 10:06.993
You know, I've always
been too scared to do that.

10:07.159 --> 10:09.486
You are the braver Josh.

10:09.701 --> 10:11.233
I've been through some shit.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.497
Tell.

10:12.574 --> 10:15.873
Spring break Fillory
turned into a massacre.

10:15.975 --> 10:19.086
- I ended up stuck...
- Stuck in the Neitherlands, me too.

10:19.155 --> 10:21.476
If the Physical Kids hadn't shown
up, I don't know how long...

10:21.544 --> 10:23.222
No one ever showed up for me.

10:23.618 --> 10:24.986
No one made it out?

10:25.157 --> 10:28.457
Some made it out,
they just forgot about me.

10:28.877 --> 10:30.306
Dude.

10:30.527 --> 10:32.923
So, I came back determined
not to need anybody.

10:33.003 --> 10:36.198
I'd be a lone wolf...
brave, heroic, solo.

10:36.317 --> 10:39.217
Got Lasik, found this sweet jacket,
and changed my fucking life.

10:39.298 --> 10:40.559
Wow.

10:40.837 --> 10:43.494
Is this like that time when we got
that Kangol hat in middle school

10:43.563 --> 10:45.219
and thought everything
was gonna be different?

10:45.287 --> 10:47.375
No, it's not like that at all.

10:47.550 --> 10:48.814
Cool.

10:48.910 --> 10:50.164
Inspiring.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.673
And, uh...

10:52.760 --> 10:53.805
Phew.

10:53.882 --> 10:55.241
Did you...

10:55.400 --> 10:57.577
Did you just roofie me?

11:04.059 --> 11:05.767
Nighty-night.

11:07.953 --> 11:10.177
Oh, ugh.

11:11.091 --> 11:12.724
What happened?

11:13.506 --> 11:15.296
What the hell are
we tied up with?

11:15.365 --> 11:16.853
It was Professor Sunderland's.

11:16.922 --> 11:18.878
Wish I took more classes
with her.

11:19.071 --> 11:21.014
Why are we all tied up?

11:21.085 --> 11:23.812
'Cause we didn't have a way
to stop The Beast's attacks,

11:24.011 --> 11:25.402
until now.

11:25.471 --> 11:26.769
We're gonna give you to him.

11:26.846 --> 11:28.537
This is insane.

11:28.871 --> 11:30.311
You can't trust The Beast.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.805
What makes you think he'll make
a deal instead of killing you?

11:32.873 --> 11:34.113
You.

11:34.302 --> 11:37.579
When he showed up here with
his key killing everybody,

11:37.648 --> 11:39.560
he kept asking for you.

11:39.891 --> 11:41.690
I don't understand, I
thought I was dead here.

11:41.758 --> 11:44.406
You are, it was actually
pretty confusing.

11:44.475 --> 11:46.218
So, maybe the guy with
the face full of moths

11:46.286 --> 11:48.416
isn't in the best place
psychologically.

11:48.668 --> 11:50.689
But it gave me an idea.

11:50.815 --> 11:52.065
Give The Beast what he wants...

11:52.142 --> 11:55.764
Julia, from an alternate timeline
in exchange for leaving us alone.

11:55.909 --> 11:57.140
And what about me?

11:57.209 --> 11:58.371
Sorry, bro.

11:58.521 --> 12:00.334
You're the Cedric Diggory of this story.

12:00.405 --> 12:02.359
At least he died looking hot.

12:03.273 --> 12:05.839
The Beast should be here soon.
He can sense magic.

12:06.115 --> 12:08.110
There's no way he'd miss
that Tesla Flexion.

12:08.452 --> 12:10.050
You have another choice.

12:10.719 --> 12:11.980
In our timeline,

12:12.187 --> 12:14.221
we killed The Beast
using a spell...

12:14.364 --> 12:15.533
the Rhinemann Ultra.

12:16.342 --> 12:17.846
Yeah,
I've heard of that.

12:18.140 --> 12:20.189
Don't you need
God-level power to cast it?

12:22.000 --> 12:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:34.213 --> 12:36.379
Yeah,
you do.

12:49.641 --> 12:51.223
Also took care of your migraines,

12:51.292 --> 12:53.405
and smoking addiction... you're welcome.

12:53.477 --> 12:55.122
- How did you...
- Long story.

12:55.233 --> 12:56.755
Act out.

12:56.832 --> 12:58.164
Easy, cowboy.

12:58.554 --> 13:00.512
I promise you, it's real.

13:00.858 --> 13:03.757
And we can use it to stop
The Beast once and for all.

13:04.498 --> 13:05.768
So, what do you say?

13:09.431 --> 13:11.615
You have this
Rhinemann spell?

13:11.687 --> 13:14.079
Dean Fogg will know where to
find it, if he's still alive.

13:14.206 --> 13:15.611
Oh, he's still alive...

13:16.002 --> 13:19.185
not exactly the premier
educator he once was.

13:19.254 --> 13:21.413
Kind of a walking opioid crisis.

13:21.482 --> 13:23.779
I'll, uh, take you to him.

13:24.352 --> 13:27.377
But Josh is our hostage
until we get back.

13:28.054 --> 13:29.833
Enjoy swapping puberty stories.

13:30.462 --> 13:32.455
They're the same stories.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.225
<i>So, you and Dean Fogg
are on good terms here?</i>

13:40.359 --> 13:41.975
I mean, he did kick
me out of Brakebills,

13:42.044 --> 13:43.928
but he's warmed to me
a bit since then.

13:44.087 --> 13:46.204
Nothing like watching
all of your students and friends

13:46.272 --> 13:49.060
get murdered by a creature from
another world to open you up.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.349
How do you know him? I thought
you didn't go to Brakebills.

13:52.445 --> 13:54.104
It's complicated.

13:54.231 --> 13:55.996
- You fucked him.
- No! What?

13:56.132 --> 13:58.896
Okay,
defensive much?

13:59.229 --> 14:00.871
He's not that bad in bed...

14:01.024 --> 14:02.260
Okay...

14:02.408 --> 14:04.481
Hey, speaking of,

14:04.801 --> 14:07.097
what's the deal with
you and me in your timeline?

14:07.333 --> 14:09.233
I'm sensing some weird kinda tension.

14:09.384 --> 14:12.736
- Is it the fun kind?
- Like I said, we were friends.

14:14.047 --> 14:15.883
It wasn't always fun.

14:16.002 --> 14:17.193
We got into a big fight,

14:17.262 --> 14:20.881
but we ended up kinda getting over it.

14:22.051 --> 14:23.310
That's it?

14:24.614 --> 14:27.378
From your face, I was expecting
something a little more...

14:27.701 --> 14:29.046
dramatic.

14:29.364 --> 14:31.430
Yeah, sorry to disappoint.

14:31.859 --> 14:32.927
This way?

14:44.112 --> 14:45.317
Marina.

14:45.779 --> 14:47.382
Aww, come on.

14:48.669 --> 14:51.062
I won't steal anything
from you this time.

14:54.479 --> 14:57.099
What did you steal from me last time?

14:57.496 --> 14:59.738
Nothing, just forget I said anything.

14:59.893 --> 15:03.607
Just... I found an
old student of yours, okay?

15:26.303 --> 15:27.508
Come in.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.683
Timeline 40?

15:37.368 --> 15:40.794
I have to live through
another 17 more of these.

15:40.865 --> 15:42.994
Uh, you don't
remember them all?

15:43.073 --> 15:44.935
Only the ones
I've been through already.

15:45.004 --> 15:47.491
I thought 22 was
absolutely dreadful,

15:47.564 --> 15:48.912
until this one.

15:52.301 --> 15:54.393
Is that really necessary?

15:54.490 --> 15:58.064
If I'm going to experience
16 more of these fiascos,

15:58.199 --> 16:00.135
it really doesn't matter
what I do, now does it?

16:00.257 --> 16:01.648
No, it doesn't.

16:01.767 --> 16:05.137
So, what about that spell,
the Rhinemann Ultra?

16:05.487 --> 16:07.567
Ah, yes, the Rhinemann Ultra.

16:07.726 --> 16:09.601
My friend Bigby had that.

16:10.071 --> 16:11.866
Unfortunately, she's dead.

16:12.206 --> 16:15.180
Everything went to shit when magic died.

16:15.662 --> 16:17.251
Creatures got set upon,

16:17.410 --> 16:19.865
chopped up to steal their mojo.

16:19.965 --> 16:21.374
That poor thing.

16:24.911 --> 16:27.173
I killed a leprechaun once.

16:28.113 --> 16:29.789
I'm not proud.

16:30.472 --> 16:31.794
Just saying.

16:32.474 --> 16:34.469
I'd forgotten how
entertaining he can be.

16:34.644 --> 16:38.339
You wouldn't happen to know
where Bigby kept it? The spell?

16:38.408 --> 16:39.705
I don't.

16:40.014 --> 16:42.378
But you're not the first
students to inquire about it.

16:42.683 --> 16:45.505
There was this whole
puzzle thing I can skip over,

16:45.574 --> 16:48.545
but... I sent two students
to see her.

16:49.180 --> 16:50.230
They died.

16:50.299 --> 16:52.019
Seems to be
a bit of a theme.

16:52.148 --> 16:53.339
There's good news.

16:53.408 --> 16:55.311
You see, their deaths were,

16:55.380 --> 16:59.643
well, earth-shatteringly horrible.
I mean, really awful...

17:00.169 --> 17:02.197
I don't like to think
about it if I can help it.

17:02.505 --> 17:05.699
Wait, so how is this good news?

17:06.844 --> 17:08.638
Because they're ghosts, dear.

17:08.781 --> 17:11.324
They still haunt the library,
last I checked...

17:11.459 --> 17:12.915
pretty deep in the stacks.

17:13.065 --> 17:15.020
They might remember the spell.

17:15.588 --> 17:19.118
But... I'd be careful
if I were you.

17:20.040 --> 17:23.281
Ghosts, well,
ghosts can be dangerous.

17:23.539 --> 17:24.800
Yeah.

17:25.776 --> 17:27.619
<i>How could you do this to me,
man?</i>

17:27.795 --> 17:31.059
You're me, I'm you, we're us.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.716
I would never betray myself.

17:32.785 --> 17:34.330
You haven't been through
what I've been through.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.671
Yes I have, except the Lasik.

17:36.740 --> 17:37.869
There's more than that.

17:38.044 --> 17:39.052
Whatever.

17:39.123 --> 17:40.586
You know,
I thought you were cool

17:40.904 --> 17:42.166
and brave.

17:42.380 --> 17:45.480
And I dug your jacket, but now
I just think you're a dick,

17:45.710 --> 17:47.810
which sucks,
because that means I'm a dick.

17:48.117 --> 17:49.381
What do you expect?

17:49.483 --> 17:51.183
My friends abandoned me.

17:51.836 --> 17:53.054
Maybe they were right too.

17:53.123 --> 17:54.849
What, did you
roofie and betray them too?

17:54.918 --> 17:56.097
No.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.892
It's not what I did,
it's what I'm gonna do.

17:57.961 --> 17:59.607
How do you know what you're gonna do?

17:59.885 --> 18:00.916
The Quickening?

18:01.052 --> 18:02.745
What's The Quickening?

18:03.086 --> 18:05.576
I can't think about it. I don'
want all their blood on my hands.

18:05.644 --> 18:07.479
What the hell is The Quickening?

18:07.582 --> 18:09.095
Nothing you need to worry about.

18:09.164 --> 18:10.669
Just be glad you didn't bang a werewolf.

18:10.737 --> 18:13.613
Let's talk about something else, okay?
Now I need an aspirin.

18:16.645 --> 18:19.690
<i>[EERIE MUSIC]</i>

18:20.685 --> 18:22.438
Yeah, the library got ransacked

18:22.507 --> 18:24.911
after The Beast took out
most of the school.

18:25.149 --> 18:27.120
Honestly,
I did most of the ransacking,

18:27.247 --> 18:29.749
but I didn't see
any ghosts.

18:33.929 --> 18:35.502
Eliot, holy shit!

18:35.571 --> 18:37.758
Oh, what the hell was that?

18:38.036 --> 18:40.796
I think I know
the students who died here.

18:41.071 --> 18:43.113
- Eliot and...
- <i>Margo?</i>

18:46.299 --> 18:49.183
I told you we need to
get our shit together, Eliot.

18:49.310 --> 18:52.059
I have my shit together.

18:52.328 --> 18:55.276
No, you're holding
your shit together, barely.

18:55.411 --> 18:57.040
There's a difference.

18:57.650 --> 19:00.512
Don't let that pixie twat
Bigby get in your head.

19:00.697 --> 19:02.468
She called me a lush,

19:02.665 --> 19:05.700
which is basically just
a nice way of saying alcoholic.

19:06.485 --> 19:08.592
And she said
I couldn't handle the spell.

19:08.791 --> 19:11.507
Why don't you prove her wrong
and help me, okay?

19:11.698 --> 19:12.994
What are we doing?

19:13.121 --> 19:16.231
Well, before we can do the
Rhinemann, we need a power-up.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.606
Here is a cooperative spell.

19:18.675 --> 19:20.710
Now, if we can cast this
together,

19:20.779 --> 19:23.473
it might just give us
enough juice to kill The Beast.

19:23.544 --> 19:25.222
And if we cast it wrong,

19:26.067 --> 19:27.263
kaboom.

19:27.414 --> 19:29.828
So, let's not cast it wrong.

19:31.116 --> 19:34.619
- What if Bigby was right?
- What if I am too drunk?

19:34.813 --> 19:37.297
What if I screw it up?

19:37.623 --> 19:39.101
Ack!

19:40.127 --> 19:42.160
You are not gonna
cock out on me.

19:42.303 --> 19:43.314
Cock out?

19:43.383 --> 19:46.925
I'd say pussy,
but let's be honest.

19:47.410 --> 19:48.761
Which one is tougher?

19:48.912 --> 19:50.328
Point made.

19:58.788 --> 20:00.534
Oh God, oh God...

20:05.784 --> 20:09.429
I screwed up, I screwed up,
I screwed up, I screwed...

20:09.498 --> 20:12.228
ah, ah, ah, ah...

20:13.407 --> 20:16.401
Ugh... Oh!

20:16.633 --> 20:20.470
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,

20:20.539 --> 20:22.828
I screwed it up, I screwed it up,
I screwed it up,

20:22.897 --> 20:23.912
I screwed it up,

20:23.981 --> 20:25.331
I screwed it up...

20:25.574 --> 20:27.545
I screwed it up,
I screwed it up...

20:27.622 --> 20:29.836
Bambi?

20:31.020 --> 20:33.047
Where's my Bambi?

20:33.167 --> 20:36.518
Where's my Bambi?

20:36.739 --> 20:39.706
- Come on... oh!
- Jesus Christ!

20:43.327 --> 20:44.804
Cocks.

20:45.718 --> 20:48.627
- Ugh, yuck, that was...
- So yuck.

20:48.696 --> 20:50.527
Not fun at all.

20:50.596 --> 20:52.275
Please tell me
you got that spell.

20:52.344 --> 20:54.601
Yeah, I, uh,
I think I can make it out.

20:55.507 --> 20:57.937
I think
someone is following us.

21:00.791 --> 21:04.034
When I give the signal,
stay out of the way.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.303
Okay.

21:08.210 --> 21:09.945
- Now!
- That's your signal?

21:14.228 --> 21:15.461
Penny?

21:15.601 --> 21:17.257
Julia.

21:19.566 --> 21:21.223
So, it is you.

21:21.799 --> 21:23.983
You're real.

21:25.286 --> 21:26.843
You're alive.

21:33.837 --> 21:35.800
Whoa, um, um...

21:35.869 --> 21:37.608
Julia, it's me.

21:37.677 --> 21:40.071
- Yeah, I... I know.
- God, it's like I'm...

21:40.644 --> 21:43.265
- I'm living in a dream.
- Just let me short-circuit this.

21:43.334 --> 21:45.133
If you think
following two strangers

21:45.212 --> 21:47.837
and then kissing one of them
is dream behavior...

21:47.945 --> 21:49.232
She's not a stranger.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.512
She's my soul mate.

21:50.684 --> 21:51.878
Oh, God.

21:52.036 --> 21:53.371
Um, I'm...

21:53.528 --> 21:57.550
I'm actually not your Julia.

21:58.743 --> 22:01.714
You see,
I'm from a different timeline.

22:02.325 --> 22:05.543
One where romantic comedy
behavior gets you arrested.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.225
I'm sorry, I thought-

22:08.398 --> 22:09.914
- No, it's... it's okay.

22:10.100 --> 22:12.295
When I heard a rumor that The
Beast was looking for her

22:12.372 --> 22:13.845
even though she's dead, I...

22:13.972 --> 22:15.434
it's crazy, but I...

22:15.621 --> 22:17.642
I had to see.

22:18.512 --> 22:20.204
I'm sorry.

22:20.337 --> 22:21.427
It was stupid.

22:21.624 --> 22:22.888
Julia, we gotta
get out of here.

22:22.956 --> 22:25.008
- Where are you going?
- To kill The Beast.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.343
- Let me come with you.
- Okay, sorry, buddy,

22:27.414 --> 22:29.092
but we got everything we need,
no baggage necessary.

22:29.160 --> 22:30.903
I wanna kill The Beast
as badly as you do.

22:32.123 --> 22:34.724
He's a traveler,
could come in handy.

22:37.227 --> 22:38.586
Eye roll.

22:46.993 --> 22:48.875
It's working, I can feel it.

22:53.743 --> 22:55.746
It's just a lot of moving pieces.

22:58.022 --> 22:59.505
So...

23:00.784 --> 23:03.930
what's up with me
in your timeline?

23:04.124 --> 23:05.447
Well,

23:06.943 --> 23:09.873
you're kind of in the Underworld.

23:10.697 --> 23:12.177
Not good.

23:12.686 --> 23:14.898
I'm not sure
you're technically dead.

23:15.126 --> 23:17.040
So, in the Underworld,
but not dead?

23:17.109 --> 23:19.462
That... sounds worse.

23:19.607 --> 23:20.940
Truth is,

23:22.036 --> 23:24.609
you got there because
you did something heroic.

23:25.321 --> 23:27.892
Unlike my alternate self,
who's a dick,

23:28.291 --> 23:30.791
possibly related to
self-esteem issues,

23:30.860 --> 23:33.215
and, I guess, lycanthropy.

23:33.437 --> 23:36.853
Yeah, it sounds like y'all
got something to work out.

23:37.668 --> 23:39.602
Here he comes.

23:41.574 --> 23:44.109
Hey, can I ask you one last time...

23:44.178 --> 23:45.378
what is The Quickening?

23:45.447 --> 23:47.073
No, you can't.

23:47.268 --> 23:49.004
I don't wanna talk about
my private tragedy,

23:49.073 --> 23:52.833
- so unless you want me to gag you...
- Okay, fine, Dick Josh.

23:52.978 --> 23:54.193
Don't call me Dick Josh.

23:54.280 --> 23:56.257
Then don't be a dick, Josh.

23:56.326 --> 23:58.887
I am not a dick.
I've had harder life than you.

23:58.956 --> 24:01.167
Did you?
What makes you so sure?

24:01.672 --> 24:03.524
Because
you get to hang out with Julia,

24:03.593 --> 24:04.847
who is awesome,

24:04.925 --> 24:07.938
and I get Marina,
who is mean all the time.

24:10.035 --> 24:11.564
Then why do you hang out
with her?

24:12.015 --> 24:15.388
Because when she dies,
it's not going to feel so bad.

24:16.082 --> 24:17.885
Truth is,
maybe my friends abandoned me,

24:17.954 --> 24:19.909
or maybe, I pushed them away.

24:20.018 --> 24:22.420
Because whatever
this thing is that's looming...

24:22.765 --> 24:25.677
because... unlike me,

24:26.230 --> 24:28.800
you were dumb enough
to bang a werewolf chick.

24:39.373 --> 24:41.424
Don't call me Dick Josh again.

24:50.868 --> 24:52.227
Wow.

24:58.905 --> 25:00.812
Oh shit, we got company!

25:03.678 --> 25:05.044
I hope you're ready.

25:10.921 --> 25:11.975
Josh, go!

25:12.044 --> 25:13.976
A Josh has to live
to tell our story.

25:17.676 --> 25:20.734
Get back! Anything inside
of 20 feet will be ash!

25:27.534 --> 25:29.100
Julia.

25:30.284 --> 25:31.992
The key didn't lie.

25:32.347 --> 25:33.347
Q?

25:33.482 --> 25:35.035
Getting a little sick of
plot twists.

25:35.112 --> 25:36.545
Focus, we need to get
out of here.

25:36.696 --> 25:38.395
I can travel, but I can't
take anyone with me

25:38.463 --> 25:40.089
'cause these fucking things
don't work without magic.

25:40.157 --> 25:41.374
Let me try.

25:53.914 --> 25:56.272
<i>Quentin is The Beast.</i>

25:56.677 --> 25:59.108
Quentin is The Beast?

25:59.180 --> 26:01.158
How the fuck is Quentin The Beast?

26:02.042 --> 26:03.661
Who's Quentin again?

26:04.055 --> 26:06.060
He's the motherfucker
who convinced my Julia

26:06.156 --> 26:08.667
to run away to Fillory in the
first place and get murdered.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.137
Yeah, by The Beast.

26:11.264 --> 26:13.974
So, you see
why this is confusing?

26:15.644 --> 26:17.344
Doesn't make any sense.

26:17.556 --> 26:20.791
Alice 23 told us that
The Beast killed Quentin.

26:20.887 --> 26:24.223
She said that he tore out his
Shade, and destroyed him.

26:24.724 --> 26:27.250
Uh, did he look destroyed
to any of you?

26:27.361 --> 26:29.723
He survived a direct hit
from the Rhinemann Ultra.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.334
I didn't even think
that was possible.

26:31.477 --> 26:34.031
You'd have to have a lot of power,
like a God.

26:34.210 --> 26:36.394
Oh, we are in such deep shit.

26:36.521 --> 26:40.136
Maybe we should just stay here
in this branch of the library.

26:40.516 --> 26:43.092
Hey Penny,
where are all the Librarians?

26:43.186 --> 26:44.409
I don't know.

26:44.863 --> 26:46.567
It's been empty as long
as I've been coming here.

26:46.635 --> 26:48.717
It's the first place I found
where I couldn't hear The Beast.

26:48.785 --> 26:50.520
Now, is that The Beast beast,

26:50.623 --> 26:53.984
or the Q beast,
or is there another beast?

26:54.158 --> 26:57.154
I think we're missing
some pages of the story here

26:57.241 --> 26:59.372
somewhere between Quentin
was killed by The Beast

26:59.441 --> 27:02.731
and Quentin is The Beast,
only more powerful.

27:02.900 --> 27:04.885
I know who
we should talk to...

27:05.226 --> 27:07.593
the one person who tried
to bring Quentin back.

27:07.784 --> 27:10.978
Do any of you have
any clue where Alice is?

27:15.572 --> 27:16.889
Um...

27:17.588 --> 27:19.803
is there an Alice Quinn on this boat?

27:20.005 --> 27:21.369
Other cabin.

27:22.871 --> 27:24.119
Thanks.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.449
I was going to
give up on Quentin.

27:28.718 --> 27:31.070
He died and his Shade
went to the Underworld,

27:31.157 --> 27:32.399
and I couldn't reach it

27:32.468 --> 27:34.859
until your
Tesla Flexion came through.

27:35.224 --> 27:36.981
That changed everything.

27:37.561 --> 27:40.611
Seeing him and hearing
that he loved me...

27:42.560 --> 27:46.364
just knowing that he was out there,
if only I could bring him back.

27:46.436 --> 27:47.542
So, what did you do?

27:47.611 --> 27:50.067
There's a creature in the Northern Marsh

27:50.662 --> 27:53.215
who can give you just
about anything for a price.

27:53.284 --> 27:57.078
What kind of evil creature-type
deal are we talking here?

27:57.310 --> 28:00.391
When I die,
I won't go to the Underworld.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.680
Now, I belong to him.

28:03.229 --> 28:05.316
So, Harvey Weinstein-type evil.

28:06.684 --> 28:09.035
So, um,
what did he give you?

28:09.193 --> 28:12.309
The power to bring
Quentin back without his Shade.

28:12.468 --> 28:14.765
I was so heartbroken, I thought
that maybe we could just

28:14.842 --> 28:17.052
fix it together once he returned.

28:18.459 --> 28:20.801
It was the biggest mistake of my life.

28:21.923 --> 28:24.068
Without his Shade, he...

28:24.544 --> 28:26.992
- He wasn't Quentin.
- No.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.879
He wanted Fillory for himself.

28:32.180 --> 28:33.651
So, he killed The Beast.

28:33.728 --> 28:35.286
But that wasn't enough.

28:35.793 --> 28:38.790
So, he found a way to kill Ember,
and steal his powers.

28:38.957 --> 28:41.025
But because he killed a God...

28:41.236 --> 28:43.382
The Old Gods took
magic away.

28:44.080 --> 28:47.168
Quentin still had the power
he stole from Ember.

28:48.395 --> 28:52.254
He told me that Fillory was the
only thing that he truly loved.

28:53.226 --> 28:55.205
It was always his escape.

28:55.482 --> 28:57.253
He was afraid of magic,

28:57.867 --> 29:00.919
of any Magician
who might bring it back.

29:01.099 --> 29:03.140
Anyone who would
oppose him,

29:03.666 --> 29:05.668
take Fillory from him...

29:06.446 --> 29:09.353
And the six fingers, moths...

29:09.560 --> 29:11.021
how'd that shit happen?

29:11.268 --> 29:12.661
I don't know.

29:13.190 --> 29:17.203
He did tell me that he finally
understood Martin Chatwin,

29:17.282 --> 29:21.103
that he was the only one who
appreciated Fillory like he did.

29:21.724 --> 29:23.130
I'm sorry.

29:23.566 --> 29:27.031
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.
I just... I loved Quentin.

29:27.126 --> 29:29.144
And I wanted to see him
again.

29:29.820 --> 29:31.225
It's okay.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.839
Hell no, it's not okay.

29:34.476 --> 29:36.580
All of our friends died
because of you,

29:36.763 --> 29:38.855
because of what you did.

29:39.472 --> 29:41.220
Because of what I did.

29:41.976 --> 29:44.692
Quentin and I used the Tesla Flexion

29:45.002 --> 29:46.320
to talk to her.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.613
And if we hadn't,
Alice never would've tried

29:49.682 --> 29:51.263
to bring her Quentin back,

29:51.818 --> 29:53.070
and none of this
would've happened.

29:53.138 --> 29:55.458
Whoa, whoa,
time travel headache.

29:55.681 --> 29:57.984
Okay, so, what, just
because you gave her the sads,

29:58.119 --> 30:00.363
it's somehow your fault that
she resurrected a crazy monster

30:00.431 --> 30:02.775
who murdered everybody and got
magic turned off? I mean, yeah,

30:02.843 --> 30:04.845
I guess it's kind of
a little bit your fault,

30:04.914 --> 30:07.131
but mostly it's on this blonde,
seven-fingered nutcase.

30:07.287 --> 30:09.790
So, why you on this ship
anyway?

30:09.893 --> 30:11.152
What is with all the bunnies?

30:11.221 --> 30:13.548
Are you trying to send
a bunch of messages or something?

30:13.691 --> 30:15.917
No, I work for them.

30:16.233 --> 30:18.356
They're radish smugglers, I...

30:18.815 --> 30:22.045
I stack boxes.
It's the only thing they can't do.

30:23.534 --> 30:26.247
And this ship is the only
place Quentin can't track me,

30:26.316 --> 30:28.332
so I can try to fix my mistake.

30:28.558 --> 30:29.598
How?

30:29.677 --> 30:32.220
By finding a weapon to kill Quentin.

30:32.457 --> 30:34.496
Okay, now we're getting somewhere.

30:42.350 --> 30:43.914
I found this.

30:49.023 --> 30:50.688
Don't ask me how.

30:56.524 --> 30:58.624
Let me guess...
you traveled to the past

30:58.693 --> 31:00.528
and made a deal with a knife maker?

31:04.865 --> 31:06.492
The only problem is,

31:06.867 --> 31:09.006
I don't have enough power to touch it.

31:19.482 --> 31:20.810
I do.

31:22.706 --> 31:24.864
I'll tell Captain Hopps
I'm leaving.

31:38.808 --> 31:40.596
Found some carrot wine.

31:43.646 --> 31:45.204
The other Josh

31:45.585 --> 31:48.453
told me something terrible
was going to happen to him.

31:48.793 --> 31:51.417
Something did... he fucking died.

31:51.555 --> 31:53.966
Yeah, but...

31:54.952 --> 31:56.446
It's gonna happen
to me too.

31:56.557 --> 31:59.094
Whatever the holy hell
was gonna happen to him

31:59.163 --> 32:01.993
that he never goddamn told me
because I never got past the part,

32:02.062 --> 32:04.072
it's called The Quickening,

32:04.706 --> 32:06.360
'cause that's not ominous.

32:07.887 --> 32:11.286
And they told me sexually-transmitted
lycanthropy was no big deal.

32:11.524 --> 32:13.370
That's what
I always heard too.

32:13.822 --> 32:17.285
Turns out,
it's murder herpes.

32:17.762 --> 32:20.384
So, yay.

32:20.717 --> 32:24.491
If I find out I may turn into
a monster and kill everyone,

32:25.038 --> 32:26.987
I'd run far away.

32:29.147 --> 32:31.490
'Cause if you're near Julia
when that happens,

32:32.198 --> 32:34.318
I'll kill you myself, Dick Josh.

32:44.887 --> 32:47.276
- We can't do that.
- But it totally works.

32:47.395 --> 32:49.233
We pop in,
we throw Alice to The Beast,

32:49.328 --> 32:50.874
and when he's munching
on her entrails,

32:50.942 --> 32:53.221
Penny pops you behind and
you stab Q-bert in the back.

32:53.301 --> 32:55.574
Marina, I'm not going
to use Alice as bait.

32:55.643 --> 32:58.610
Why not? I mean, you heard her.
This is all her fault,

32:58.679 --> 33:00.537
she wants to fix
what she screwed up.

33:01.340 --> 33:04.996
There are ways to do this without
sacrificing her life, okay?

33:05.065 --> 33:07.794
Are you getting cold feet because The
Beast is your former best friend,

33:07.862 --> 33:10.342
the... unimpressive white guy?

33:10.421 --> 33:11.893
No, it's not that.

33:11.962 --> 33:13.719
Because people have already
died in this timeline.

33:13.787 --> 33:15.155
Basically, everyone I know...

33:15.232 --> 33:19.001
they're dead because of short,
blonde, and crazy, and I guess you.

33:19.295 --> 33:22.306
But why would you give a shit about
that? You just want your stupid key.

33:30.149 --> 33:33.499
I tried to kill a God once
with help from a friend...

33:34.304 --> 33:35.724
you.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.705
I used you as bait to lure him.

33:40.302 --> 33:43.425
And when I couldn't get back
in time, he killed you.

33:44.736 --> 33:47.301
I screwed up, and you died.

33:48.703 --> 33:50.828
And it was horrible.

33:51.731 --> 33:52.959
Jesus Christ.

33:53.154 --> 33:54.420
I'm so sorry.

33:54.738 --> 33:56.683
I couldn't tell you before because

33:57.717 --> 33:59.298
it was my fault.

34:01.229 --> 34:03.286
And I can never do that
to someone again.

34:07.171 --> 34:09.953
So, what do you wanna do?
I mean, this shit is dangerous.

34:10.022 --> 34:12.241
We can't just waltz up
on The Beast.

34:13.409 --> 34:15.348
He may act like a beast, but,

34:16.929 --> 34:19.533
deep down, he's the Quentin
I've always known.

34:21.371 --> 34:24.851
So, what are you saying?
You wanna spare him?

34:28.201 --> 34:29.672
I wanna use that against him.

34:39.684 --> 34:41.509
Uh, wow.

34:42.011 --> 34:45.966
He... really let the place go.

34:46.177 --> 34:47.768
What is all this shit?

34:52.288 --> 34:53.893
The Winter's Doe...

34:54.797 --> 34:57.336
what's... left of her.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.585
Jesus, did he eat her?

35:01.717 --> 35:04.406
These are the polished rocks
from the Silver Banks.

35:04.757 --> 35:07.465
That's where Martin Chatwin
learned to skip rocks.

35:10.095 --> 35:12.462
This is a bugle from Brass City.

35:13.862 --> 35:15.830
Rupert learned to play on this.

35:16.389 --> 35:18.579
- You guys, this isn't trash.
- No.

35:18.737 --> 35:23.371
This is a "Fillory and
Further" fan boy's collection.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.134
It's trash.

35:25.553 --> 35:27.479
Quentin's been hoarding this.

35:44.872 --> 35:46.538
You're not a very good player,

35:46.607 --> 35:47.897
whoever you are.

35:54.919 --> 35:56.477
Hilarious.

36:03.329 --> 36:04.757
Alice?

36:06.115 --> 36:08.180
I can smell you.

36:09.183 --> 36:10.767
Why don't you come on out?

36:10.873 --> 36:12.126
He knows I'm here.

36:12.203 --> 36:13.853
Hurry, quick, let's go.

36:13.922 --> 36:15.100
I'm trying.

36:15.169 --> 36:19.390
Shit, he must've cast a ward.
I can't travel into the throne room.

36:21.445 --> 36:23.650
Fine, you don't wanna come out?

36:24.356 --> 36:26.286
Then I will...

36:26.804 --> 36:28.472
fill the room with fire.

36:30.841 --> 36:32.769
You guys stay,
I'll go.

36:32.838 --> 36:35.066
- No, Alice, don't.
- I have to.

36:37.426 --> 36:39.506
If I don't, he'll kill all of us.

36:44.966 --> 36:46.764
I'm here, Quentin.

36:50.525 --> 36:51.837
Wait.

36:52.235 --> 36:53.656
I am the only one
who can stop him.

37:02.617 --> 37:04.473
I made a mistake.

37:05.617 --> 37:08.346
- I should never have run from you.
- That's what I said.

37:08.860 --> 37:11.456
You killed every
Magician you could find,

37:12.249 --> 37:13.687
except me.

37:15.690 --> 37:17.219
Why?

37:17.812 --> 37:19.132
I thought about it,
but you were doing

37:19.200 --> 37:21.562
such a good job of
torturing yourself.

37:22.515 --> 37:24.318
And the others, I...

37:25.891 --> 37:29.594
I could say that they were a threat,
but honestly, I just realized

37:29.663 --> 37:32.003
that I didn't like them
very much.

37:32.661 --> 37:34.496
Doesn't sound like you.

37:36.583 --> 37:37.887
I know you.

37:37.956 --> 37:39.564
You knew me.

37:39.932 --> 37:43.220
You're not Martin Chatwin, you're
not The Beast... you hate The Beast.

37:43.374 --> 37:44.674
True.

37:45.683 --> 37:49.873
But you show up with a face full of moths,
and everyone loses their shit.

37:52.449 --> 37:56.483
People think that
The Beast

37:57.466 --> 37:59.768
is invincible.

38:03.670 --> 38:06.577
Who wouldn't use that
to their advantage?

38:08.628 --> 38:10.827
I think that he would be flattered

38:11.516 --> 38:14.959
I did a Dread Pirate Roberts.

38:16.220 --> 38:17.986
"The Princess Bride."

38:18.286 --> 38:20.845
Please, Quentin.

38:21.306 --> 38:24.389
I know the man that I love
is still inside you somewhere.

38:24.458 --> 38:26.194
Yeah, I ate him.

38:27.177 --> 38:28.872
Okay, this is obviously

38:29.163 --> 38:31.752
a ploy to buy your friends time,

38:31.821 --> 38:34.424
so why don't we just get
this over with?

38:41.530 --> 38:43.741
That's a familiar scent.

38:47.644 --> 38:49.184
Julia.

38:52.077 --> 38:54.396
You can't kill me, you've already tried.

39:03.856 --> 39:05.221
What did you...

39:05.630 --> 39:07.136
what did you do to me?

39:07.211 --> 39:08.354
It's my Shade.

39:08.731 --> 39:10.291
And I can live without it
if I have to.

39:12.421 --> 39:14.026
Everything that you are
feeling right now,

39:14.094 --> 39:17.247
I have felt...
grief, sadness, shame, regret.

39:17.808 --> 39:19.062
Q?

39:21.906 --> 39:23.467
Alice.

39:28.598 --> 39:30.012
I killed her.

39:32.946 --> 39:34.756
I'm so sorry.

39:36.129 --> 39:37.648
Q?

39:39.395 --> 39:41.358
Where did you find the key?

39:43.532 --> 39:45.268
Um...

39:46.334 --> 39:47.852
I heard it could be used
to bring back magic,

39:47.920 --> 39:52.362
and I couldn't have that,
so I got it first.

39:52.713 --> 39:55.174
I know why you were looking for me.
The key...

39:55.680 --> 39:58.003
it showed you visions of the future...

39:58.779 --> 40:00.411
me killing you.

40:00.935 --> 40:02.191
Julia...

40:02.260 --> 40:03.978
I'm here to tell you I'm not.

40:04.609 --> 40:07.178
I'm not going to kill you.

40:07.890 --> 40:09.642
I wanna help you.

40:10.402 --> 40:12.996
The visions weren't of you
killing me.

40:14.133 --> 40:17.540
I saw you opening a lock
at the End Of The World.

40:19.366 --> 40:22.784
You were trying to let magic in, but
you let in something much worse.

40:23.304 --> 40:24.610
What?

40:24.796 --> 40:26.654
A monster.

40:29.894 --> 40:31.713
One even worse than me.

40:32.968 --> 40:35.091
You should take your Shade back.

41:10.725 --> 41:12.224
You look dumb.

41:12.876 --> 41:16.472
I'm trying to get this
stupid key to open up a door.

41:16.689 --> 41:20.024
Well, isn't there, like, some
kind of ritual for that? Or...

41:20.093 --> 41:21.335
It would be nice

41:21.404 --> 41:25.459
if there was, but no,
so, key-waving.

41:26.913 --> 41:28.565
Is that my Josh's jacket?

41:28.676 --> 41:29.828
Yeah.

41:29.897 --> 41:32.442
Hm, you look cooler.

41:33.570 --> 41:35.040
You are mean.

41:40.267 --> 41:44.486
So, the key show you anything?

41:44.851 --> 41:46.862
Visions of the future?

41:47.476 --> 41:48.571
Nothing.

41:48.775 --> 41:49.937
Okay.

41:50.414 --> 41:52.757
Then I guess you don't know
that I'm coming with you.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.284
What?

41:54.353 --> 41:56.197
Your Penny's dead, or,

41:56.613 --> 41:59.407
not alive in some
confusing way.

42:00.353 --> 42:02.616
- Penny, I don't...
- I'm not asking permission.

42:04.137 --> 42:05.517
Okay.

42:07.716 --> 42:09.123
I'm not her.

42:09.303 --> 42:10.763
I know that.

42:12.198 --> 42:13.936
It's just,
there's nothing here for me.

42:14.121 --> 42:15.267
But there?

42:16.087 --> 42:17.629
Give it time.

42:19.954 --> 42:21.456
Hey, uh, Jules?

42:21.629 --> 42:23.165
We have a door.

42:26.121 --> 42:29.775
Um, is it bad that Marina
just ran right through?

42:29.971 --> 42:31.742
I honestly don't know.
