00:14.080 --> 00:16.810
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You are my god.

00:16.983 --> 00:18.848
My inspiration, my everything.

00:20.253 --> 00:22.414
He's on a different level now,
how he listens...

00:22.589 --> 00:24.853
...and plays records.
I think he's very special...

00:25.025 --> 00:26.652
...because no other DJ can do that.

00:28.061 --> 00:30.291
I don't know what he was doing,
whether he was...

00:30.463 --> 00:32.454
...honing his talents
in another direction.

00:32.631 --> 00:34.725
He just disappeared
from the scene completely.

00:34.901 --> 00:36.198
It was really depressing.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.606
He's probably down in South America,
still hanging out.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.436
Probably trying to snort up
one of the countries, or...

00:43.610 --> 00:46.078
I don't know, he's just...

00:46.246 --> 00:48.737
I like to think he's still out there.

01:22.715 --> 01:26.116
Frankie, I'm curious. Can you tell me
about your flip-flop collection?

01:26.286 --> 01:31.519
I'm a bit of the lmelda Marcos
of the flip-flop world.

01:31.691 --> 01:33.591
Flip-flop, for me, is perfection.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.958
And sometimes if I'm stuck
and I can't mix, I can't...

01:38.131 --> 01:41.066
You know, I'm a creative person.
I'm an artist.

01:41.234 --> 01:44.670
So sometimes I just stare
at a flip-flop for hours.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.068
I'm not joking.
I'm being serious, yeah.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.730
- Really?
- Yes, I do.

01:48.908 --> 01:50.899
Recently, you've been married...

01:51.077 --> 01:54.342
...so how is it now
being a husband?

01:54.514 --> 01:56.641
- An "ass band"?
- Husband.

01:56.816 --> 01:57.976
- Oh, husband.
- Husband.

01:58.151 --> 02:00.517
A husband. Yeah, it's very nice.

02:00.687 --> 02:02.052
It's what I've...

02:02.222 --> 02:03.484
Say hello!

02:03.656 --> 02:07.217
Hello, lbiza!

02:11.831 --> 02:14.163
DJ! DJ! DJ! DJ!

04:42.782 --> 04:45.717
This is Pete Tong, you're listening
to The Essential Selection.

04:45.885 --> 04:48.649
I'm sitting across from Frankie Wilde.
How are you, Frankie?

04:48.821 --> 04:50.083
I feel like a star, man.

04:50.690 --> 04:52.658
Eleven years.
Eleven years in Ibiza...

04:52.825 --> 04:54.986
...playing some of the best clubs
in the world.

04:55.161 --> 04:57.629
- How do you feel about it this year?
- What, mate?

04:57.797 --> 05:01.733
It's your 11 th year, Frankie,
playing in Ibiza. You must be thrilled.

05:06.572 --> 05:09.564
It's been fucking hot, ain't it, here,
the last week?

05:09.742 --> 05:11.573
God.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.143
I mean...

05:14.480 --> 05:16.471
...think about...
You're old, like me.

05:16.649 --> 05:18.583
You're an old geezer.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.311
You remember that martini
campaign in the '70s?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.114
"Martini is"

05:23.289 --> 05:25.519
Dot, dot, dot, dot.
Remember that?

05:26.559 --> 05:29.027
When I was a kid,
that wow-ed me out, man, bigtime.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.062
It's like, "is" what?
What the fuck is it?

05:32.231 --> 05:35.064
What the fuck is martini?

05:35.234 --> 05:39.295
But I was young,
and I didn't really understand.

05:39.472 --> 05:42.999
And now I'm mature...

05:43.176 --> 05:47.579
...and I've lived 38 years,
and I can confidently say:

05:48.414 --> 05:50.041
"Lbiza is"

05:51.017 --> 05:54.714
Dot, dot, dot, dot. You know
what I mean? And that's really nice.

05:54.887 --> 05:57.515
It's really nice
to be able to feel that.

06:00.059 --> 06:02.050
There's spunk everywhere
on this island.

06:02.228 --> 06:05.629
Everyone's done it,
and they've been free with it.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.663
They haven't done it
to make babies.

06:07.834 --> 06:10.826
They've fucking swung out
and spun a bit out...

06:11.003 --> 06:13.471
...and it's hit a plant,
and that's grown.

06:13.806 --> 06:16.297
Wall, and there's vines
and ivy and shit.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.105
It's all spunk. Look at this lot out here.
Look at them.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.180
They all love it.
They fucking love it.

06:23.349 --> 06:27.445
- Who out there likes to fucking party?
- Yeah!

06:27.620 --> 06:30.817
I can't hear you! Who out there
likes to fucking party?

06:30.990 --> 06:33.982
- Who likes to fucking party?
- Yeah!

06:47.039 --> 06:48.870
Frankie was definitely
one of the best.

06:49.041 --> 06:50.770
He had his very, sort of,
own style...

06:50.943 --> 06:53.173
...his very own momentum
with the crowd.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.243
No one else did it his way.

06:59.085 --> 07:02.577
He's a showman
as much as he is a musician.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.349
He controlled the crowd
musically and physically.

07:08.227 --> 07:10.195
He was a born natural
behind the turntable.

07:10.363 --> 07:12.297
There's no doubt.
I was jealous of that.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.294
I always had to try a bit harder.

07:53.673 --> 07:55.470
Super, super, super, loco.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.586
Frankie was cruising along,
doing his thing...

08:14.760 --> 08:17.991
...getting all the attention that
he needed. And then he met Max.

08:18.164 --> 08:22.624
No. Hey, tell him it's like a wasp
just stung my clit, yeah.

08:22.802 --> 08:25.327
I don't give a fuck if he's religious.
Tell him anyway.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.530
Fuck him. Bye. Anyway...

08:28.875 --> 08:30.809
A bit of a tosser.
Not my sort of person...

08:30.977 --> 08:33.001
...but absolutely took him
to the next level.

08:39.751 --> 08:41.515
I love you, Max!

08:44.857 --> 08:47.348
Max first brought Frankie
to my attention.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.620
I knew he had what it took
behind the decks...

08:49.795 --> 08:55.825
...but it turned out that Frankie really
understood the music production side.

08:56.002 --> 08:58.197
You know,
knew his way around a studio.

09:02.308 --> 09:04.640
Do you think
we're making a jazz album?

09:04.810 --> 09:07.540
I'm just right in the middle
of going all the fucking way.

09:07.713 --> 09:09.647
Should we swap them over
for some brushes?

09:09.815 --> 09:11.282
You know:

09:12.552 --> 09:14.144
Start fucking hitting those drums.

09:14.320 --> 09:18.086
Start banging those drums like
you bang your fucking sister!

09:18.257 --> 09:20.623
Clear, Siegfried?

09:22.895 --> 09:25.523
That's the first one.

09:27.466 --> 09:30.435
So I signed him straightaway.

09:31.203 --> 09:33.171
And Frankie delivered.

09:40.046 --> 09:41.673
It was massive.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.476
Come out of car windows, in the
supermarket. Even my grandmother...

09:46.819 --> 09:50.186
...would whistle that tune when I went
to see her in the nursing home.

10:16.015 --> 10:20.679
Frankie met Sonya when they were
on the video shoot to "Rise Again."

10:20.853 --> 10:23.947
Oh, man. I mean, everybody knew
that she'd been about.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.648
But he seemed to like that.
I mean, that was his thing.

10:26.826 --> 10:30.284
You know, I mean,
even I'd had a go at her.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.532
15-love.

10:43.709 --> 10:46.109
I was thinking, you know how
Paul Newman's got...

10:46.278 --> 10:47.973
...his salad dressings and that?

10:48.147 --> 10:51.742
So why not Frankie Wilde hummus?

10:51.917 --> 10:54.442
- That's a good idea.
- People come and see the gigs...

10:54.620 --> 10:57.145
...they say,
"Fuck, that was a great set, Frankie."

10:57.323 --> 10:59.518
I'll say, "Cheers, mate.
You want some hummus?"

10:59.692 --> 11:02.024
- You know, just as a thing.
- Yeah.

11:02.261 --> 11:04.525
Quite a good name for an album.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.028
How's that?

11:06.198 --> 11:08.325
Frankie Wilde, Hummus.

11:08.601 --> 11:10.569
What, call my album Hummus?

11:10.736 --> 11:12.727
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

11:12.905 --> 11:15.499
I've got good ideas, Frankie.
You should listen to me.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.542
If I've got my own hummus brand
and my album's called Hummus...

11:18.711 --> 11:21.236
...it's getting a bit much.
- I think it's a good name.

11:21.414 --> 11:23.746
Why don't I change my name
to "Frankie Hummus"?

11:23.916 --> 11:25.440
No, it sounds good. Yeah.

11:25.618 --> 11:29.179
I think a lot of people tolerated her
because she was Frankie's wife.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.882
At the end of the day, I think
she was partying with everyone else.

11:33.059 --> 11:35.721
I didn't like her. I didn't think
she was good for him.

11:36.295 --> 11:38.991
- I fucking hate you.
- I fucking hate you.

11:39.165 --> 11:41.497
- And did I fuck her?
- Yeah.

11:43.736 --> 11:45.795
Yeah, I fucked her.

11:52.378 --> 11:55.074
Legend has it that Frank's problems
started undramatically.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.542
It was the simplest thing
that kicked it off.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.551
It was years and years of noise
was the basis of the problem.

12:01.721 --> 12:05.987
But the very beginnings of it,
in his life, started very plainly.

13:04.283 --> 13:07.184
Frankie's problem was quite
a common problem amongst DJ's...

13:07.353 --> 13:09.617
...an occupational hazard.
They work in the clubs.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.553
The noise just takes its toll.

13:16.328 --> 13:19.092
Someone like Frankie,
having a problem like that, I thought:

13:19.265 --> 13:21.961
"This geezer's gonna go.
He's gonna lose it."

13:22.134 --> 13:23.362
And he did lose it.

13:24.703 --> 13:26.864
I watched him lose it,
slowly but surely.

14:36.175 --> 14:38.234
Fucking come on, then!

15:23.255 --> 15:27.248
I think we could have the Spanish
look, I like this color for the water.

15:27.426 --> 15:29.860
Perhaps maybe that one, Japanese.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.520
Frankie. Morning, honey.

15:32.698 --> 15:34.188
Oh, Frankie!

15:44.944 --> 15:47.845
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

15:50.649 --> 15:52.412
- Morning.
- Morning, sweet...

15:53.953 --> 15:55.750
You all right?

15:57.323 --> 15:59.484
If we go for the Spanish look...

16:15.874 --> 16:17.705
It's for the garden.

16:24.750 --> 16:28.049
- A bit of both.
- Okay. Little bit of both.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.518
- We can do that, can't we?
- Yeah.

16:30.723 --> 16:34.124
Fuck! Fucking hell!

16:45.971 --> 16:47.529
You all right?

16:49.308 --> 16:51.401
His hearing was fucked.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.808
But he tried to keep working
and plow through.

16:54.980 --> 16:57.005
You know,
put the horse blinkers on.

16:57.182 --> 17:02.119
Ignore the problem, and it'll go away.
You know, always works for me.

17:36.455 --> 17:40.186
Can you tell us what's happening
with the new album?

17:42.628 --> 17:44.892
Have I got a spot? Have I...?

17:45.798 --> 17:46.992
- No.
- It's fine.

17:47.166 --> 17:48.895
You're perfect. You're perfect.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.128
Your fans are curious about
the new album. They have to know.

17:52.304 --> 17:55.273
It's good. It's going really well.
It's going really well.

17:55.441 --> 18:00.469
Been bending the sound, sort of.
I've been forging it.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.774
With a lyrical smelter.

18:07.352 --> 18:08.614
Yeah.

18:10.322 --> 18:13.382
- Not as beautiful as you.
- Thank you.

18:14.293 --> 18:16.523
And I got these two...

18:16.695 --> 18:18.595
...like, Austrian mates...

18:18.764 --> 18:21.597
...who are stoking the fires.

18:21.767 --> 18:25.669
Everybody should have
at least two Austrian mates.

18:25.838 --> 18:28.636
Everybody should have
at least two.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.866
When can we expect
the new album to come out?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.374
- Soon.
- Soon?

18:32.544 --> 18:33.636
Ish.

19:05.544 --> 19:07.205
Can I have a word?

19:07.379 --> 19:09.142
Can I have a word?

19:09.314 --> 19:10.975
Yeah. It's good?

19:11.150 --> 19:13.778
I took a call just before,
a couple of hours ago.

19:13.952 --> 19:17.285
I forgot to mention it, but I need to...
I need to...

19:17.456 --> 19:22.223
The album people,
they want the lyrics for the sleeve.

19:22.394 --> 19:25.852
I just need you to write them down.
We can pop them off.

19:26.031 --> 19:28.522
Get them off and we don't have
to worry about it.

19:28.700 --> 19:30.565
No, no, we never write them down.

19:33.572 --> 19:34.971
That's it.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.409
What else did you sing after that?

19:42.247 --> 19:43.646
Frankie.

19:45.384 --> 19:46.715
Frank.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.480
Frank!

19:49.288 --> 19:50.516
What?

19:51.223 --> 19:53.123
Have you got a condom?

19:53.292 --> 19:56.557
- Have you got a condom?
- No, I'm not gonna fuck her.

19:56.728 --> 19:58.889
I'm knackered.
I'm just gonna have a nosh.

20:20.586 --> 20:23.146
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

20:47.145 --> 20:52.105
Well, denial is a river in Frank,
and it runs deep.

20:52.618 --> 20:57.920
And his sets
were shambolic on times.

20:58.090 --> 21:02.652
Clearly, could only be the work
of a man who couldn't hear.

21:48.073 --> 21:52.169
It wasn't pretty, but, you know,
for me...

21:52.344 --> 21:55.108
...for someone that has gone
through something like that...

21:55.280 --> 21:58.511
...to still get up there
and give it a go is a big thing.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.147
Off! Off! Off! Off!

23:09.955 --> 23:12.423
Let go, fuckers!

23:13.392 --> 23:14.882
Fuckers!

23:26.571 --> 23:28.232
Fucking fuckers!

24:12.884 --> 24:15.182
- Because they dangle
when they're cold.

24:15.353 --> 24:18.914
Yeah.
Now, listen very carefully, okay?

24:19.090 --> 24:21.650
It's very important.
This is very important.

24:21.827 --> 24:26.264
I have cancer, okay?
And I'm very delicate.

24:26.431 --> 24:28.797
So they have to be very gentle.

24:30.235 --> 24:31.532
- Hey, Frank.
- All right?

24:31.703 --> 24:33.102
- How are you?
- All right.

24:33.271 --> 24:34.795
- Attaboy.
- How you doing?

24:34.973 --> 24:36.964
Good, good. Motherfucker.

24:37.142 --> 24:40.475
Listen, I had that dream again.
I was sucking my own cock.

24:40.645 --> 24:42.840
But this time,
I don't have a huge cock.

24:43.014 --> 24:46.040
I have a normal-sized cock.
No spine. My spine disappears.

24:46.218 --> 24:51.554
So my head, it just flops down
onto my... Anyway...

24:51.723 --> 24:54.521
- You all right?
- Yeah. Sit down, sit down, sit down.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.490
Look, I was just talking to the label...

24:59.664 --> 25:02.792
...and they'd like to see
a couple of tracks.

25:03.802 --> 25:07.067
The label would like
a couple of tracks, Frank.

25:07.772 --> 25:09.865
- It's coming. It's coming.
- Yeah.

25:10.041 --> 25:13.204
The tracks are coming, man, relax.
Don't worry, mate, it's fine.

25:13.378 --> 25:16.347
- It's all right.
- I saw your show last night.

25:16.515 --> 25:19.313
I tell you,
I really fucked up last night, man.

25:19.484 --> 25:23.750
- It's my call. I picked the wrong set.
- It stunk. It stunk like shit, Frank.

25:23.922 --> 25:27.187
It stunk like...
Well, like you shit your pants...

25:27.359 --> 25:30.795
...and you just sat in it for a week,
and then you shit yourself again.

25:30.962 --> 25:32.759
That's how fucking bad
it stunk, Frank.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.065
- It was shit, yeah?
- It was shit, Frank. Yes, it was shit.

25:36.234 --> 25:38.532
I tell you, the fucking monitors
at that place.

25:38.703 --> 25:41.069
You know,
I'm fucking mixing my heart out.

25:41.239 --> 25:44.072
I can't hear a fucking thing.
We gotta have words with them...

25:44.242 --> 25:46.574
...get this sorted out,
otherwise we blow that place out.

25:46.745 --> 25:49.043
- I couldn't hear a fucking thing.
- Right.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.977
Because you might be deaf, Frank.

25:51.783 --> 25:54.377
- What's that?
- You could be deaf, Frank.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.384
- What you saying?
- You are deaf.

25:56.555 --> 26:00.423
- Can't hear you, Max.
- You're fucking deaf, asshole!

26:02.093 --> 26:04.152
Who the fuck you fooling, Frank?

26:04.329 --> 26:06.797
You're talking like
a 95-year-old war vet.

26:07.365 --> 26:10.163
Frank, you need professional help.

26:13.672 --> 26:16.766
I'm thinking about getting
some professional help.

26:18.310 --> 26:19.504
Yeah.

26:20.812 --> 26:22.439
Yeah.

26:30.388 --> 26:31.650
Fuck it.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.508
Hello, Frank.

27:00.819 --> 27:02.013
Come in, Frank.

27:06.758 --> 27:08.749
Frank!

28:38.917 --> 28:40.612
I don't want you to panic, Frank.

28:40.785 --> 28:43.117
I've got some bad news
for you, though.

28:43.288 --> 28:46.052
You're going deaf.
Completely deaf.

28:49.794 --> 28:52.786
As you know, your right ear
is completely shot.

28:52.964 --> 28:57.901
Your left ear, that's this one,
has got 20 percent left.

28:58.069 --> 29:00.697
You were born
with little holes in them...

29:00.872 --> 29:03.670
...and slowly the fluid pressure
is dropping.

29:03.842 --> 29:06.572
Can't you just plug it up
with some ear putty or something?

29:06.745 --> 29:10.272
The ear organism, it's way too
sensitive and delicate for that.

29:10.448 --> 29:13.349
Surgery doesn't work.
Cochlear implant doesn't work.

29:13.518 --> 29:17.147
You've gotta stop exposing yourself
to so much noise.

29:17.322 --> 29:18.619
What do you mean by that?

29:18.790 --> 29:21.782
It means that if you listen
to absolute silence...

29:21.960 --> 29:24.986
...your ears are gonna last
a little bit longer.

29:25.163 --> 29:28.030
They're crumbling as we speak.

29:28.666 --> 29:30.998
Stop the drugs, Frank.
Stop the drinking.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.660
Go to bed at a decent hour.

29:33.838 --> 29:36.807
We can give you a hearing aid
that gives you temporary hearing...

29:36.975 --> 29:39.205
...but that damages the ear
even further.

29:39.377 --> 29:42.073
- Speak up.
- These are the facts, Frank.

29:42.247 --> 29:45.580
These are the facts, Frank.
We can't change them.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.116
You are deaf, man.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.812
You are a deaf man.

29:51.990 --> 29:55.551
This is costing me 2000
fucking euros an hour.

29:55.727 --> 29:57.854
Chuck me a fucking bone!

29:58.029 --> 30:00.156
This is your hearing aid, Frank.

30:00.331 --> 30:04.665
Use it only when you have to.
Only when you have to.

30:05.537 --> 30:10.065
- Only when I have to.
- Right. Only when you have to.

30:10.241 --> 30:12.436
Got that? No exceptions.

30:19.050 --> 30:20.711
Can you keep on gigging?

30:20.985 --> 30:22.475
Frankie?

30:22.821 --> 30:25.312
Can you keep on gigging?

30:26.724 --> 30:28.783
Can you keep on gigging?

30:33.765 --> 30:35.494
I love them both, you know?

30:36.835 --> 30:40.293
I love hearing, and I love DJ'ing.

30:46.277 --> 30:49.610
I was thinking this morning
maybe I should write a book.

30:50.315 --> 30:51.907
That's a brilliant idea.

30:52.283 --> 30:55.013
That might take years, though, so...

30:55.520 --> 30:58.956
Perhaps, like, a pamphlet.
A sort of brochure thing.

30:59.290 --> 31:00.723
Listen, Frankie, l...

31:02.460 --> 31:05.361
I want to tell you that
whatever your decision...

31:05.530 --> 31:08.727
...I will support it wholeheartedly.

31:08.900 --> 31:12.165
You and me and little Kingie.

31:13.071 --> 31:15.062
That's all that matters to me.

31:15.406 --> 31:20.070
Deaf, dumb or blind, baby,
we will get through this.

31:21.746 --> 31:24.340
It's brilliant to almost hear that.

31:25.183 --> 31:26.616
Fair play to the guy.

31:26.784 --> 31:29.810
I have no idea what
I would have done in that situation.

31:29.988 --> 31:33.947
I mean, there he is.
You know, he's between a rock...

31:34.125 --> 31:36.218
...and you know, another rock...

31:36.394 --> 31:39.488
...which is harder and bigger.

32:37.855 --> 32:38.844
Hi.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.858
I'm actually thinking about
giving it a bit of a break.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.024
Of course I fucking love you.

32:51.669 --> 32:53.364
How can you say that?

32:53.538 --> 32:58.339
I just think we don't necessarily
bring out the best in each other.

32:59.510 --> 33:01.478
Not always the best thing for me.

33:01.646 --> 33:04.308
It's my problem.
It's not your problem.

33:04.916 --> 33:08.511
You know what I mean? Why can't we
just be mates for a little bit?

33:08.686 --> 33:12.417
I could just give you a ring
every few weeks, you know?

33:12.590 --> 33:16.720
Just make it a little bit more casual.
Couldn't we do that?

34:27.498 --> 34:29.625
It sounds like the caca.

34:31.402 --> 34:32.630
No.

34:33.404 --> 34:34.837
Is Frank there?

34:35.739 --> 34:37.799
Is this Frank standing
in front of me?

34:38.842 --> 34:43.280
No, this is a drunken baboon
drooling on the mix board.

34:43.981 --> 34:46.472
What in all of the heavens
are you on, Frank?

34:52.590 --> 34:54.420
Are you fucking deaf
or something?

34:57.695 --> 35:00.061
What's your fucking problem?

35:03.434 --> 35:05.698
They would laugh you
out of Austria.

35:06.737 --> 35:08.967
I can hear them laughing now.

35:10.708 --> 35:14.166
Where is Frankie fucking Wilde,
Frankie?

35:14.712 --> 35:16.145
Is he fucking gone?

35:16.314 --> 35:20.114
And the fucking,
"Go away. Stay, stay, stay," huh?

35:37.335 --> 35:38.962
So you're deaf?

35:42.940 --> 35:44.965
You're deaf?

35:46.978 --> 35:48.411
Almost.

35:51.616 --> 35:55.416
This is like all the terrors
and the horrors of the world...

35:55.586 --> 35:57.679
...raining down on your skull.

36:01.759 --> 36:06.492
Last three months,
it's really rapidly accelerated.

36:06.664 --> 36:09.224
But I've... I've got this.

36:09.400 --> 36:12.597
And I really thought
I could do this job, man.

36:13.738 --> 36:15.228
I'll show you.

36:15.406 --> 36:17.135
Hello, Mr. Drum!

36:17.308 --> 36:19.003
Drummer!

36:22.480 --> 36:26.075
The left ear,
there's still a little bit left.

36:26.817 --> 36:29.718
And this little fella
is a fucking lifeline, man.

36:30.121 --> 36:33.852
But I can use it only when I have to.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.624
Long as I'm careful,
I can hear more.

37:11.662 --> 37:15.223
- What? What has happened?
- What?

38:52.663 --> 38:54.096
He was stone-fucking deaf.

38:54.265 --> 38:58.099
There's not much you can do as a DJ
if you can't hear.

38:58.369 --> 39:01.065
Generally, the field of music...

39:01.238 --> 39:04.435
...other than the obvious example...

39:04.608 --> 39:08.203
...has been dominated
by people who can hear.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.038
He was never gonna hear again.

39:11.215 --> 39:14.878
It was as simple as that. It was...

39:15.186 --> 39:16.175
...gone.

41:09.366 --> 41:11.129
All right, Frankie?

41:12.470 --> 41:14.165
All right?

41:16.674 --> 41:17.971
Blink!

41:18.242 --> 41:19.800
Hola, mate.

41:20.678 --> 41:21.906
- All right?
- All right.

41:23.981 --> 41:25.380
Good game?

41:25.549 --> 41:29.315
- Is it a good game?
- Yeah, it's all right. It's pretty good.

41:29.487 --> 41:30.920
It's decent.

41:35.960 --> 41:37.359
Sonya in?

41:37.528 --> 41:38.859
Sonya in?

41:39.029 --> 41:41.657
Yeah, she's here. She's upstairs.

41:41.832 --> 41:43.891
- She's packing, mate.
- She all right?

41:44.401 --> 41:45.868
She's leaving you, Frank.

41:46.036 --> 41:47.901
She's leaving you.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.596
For me.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.242
- Get in there!
- Did you see that?

41:57.414 --> 41:59.006
Fucking hell!

41:59.183 --> 42:03.279
Fucking, how was that one, eh?
Ter-fucking-rific!

42:05.289 --> 42:07.257
- Yes, brilliant, wasn't it?
- Want a line?

42:07.424 --> 42:09.688
Not right now, thanks. Cheers.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.125
Frankie.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.601
- You all right?
- Yeah.

42:35.185 --> 42:37.153
I'm leaving you.

42:38.689 --> 42:41.658
I'm gonna take the tiger.
That's mine.

42:41.825 --> 42:45.056
And I want those ones,
obviously, because they're mine.

42:45.229 --> 42:49.791
And you can have the sculpture
that your mother bought us.

42:52.269 --> 42:54.567
Aren't you upset, Frankie?

42:56.740 --> 42:59.573
Do you wanna say anything to me?
Anything at all?

43:20.130 --> 43:21.461
Frankie!

43:33.844 --> 43:35.778
Where the fuck's the album, Frank?

43:37.881 --> 43:41.282
Where the fuck
is the album, Frank?!

43:43.520 --> 43:45.886
Where the fuck is the album?!

43:57.534 --> 44:00.298
It smells like shit in here, Frank.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.336
What the fuck's happened to you?

44:03.007 --> 44:05.373
What the fuck happened
to you, Frank?

44:05.643 --> 44:08.111
I don't know what this is.
I don't know what this is.

44:08.345 --> 44:12.076
This is bullshit, Frank. This isn't
how you take on things, huh?

44:13.751 --> 44:14.979
Listen...

44:17.421 --> 44:19.821
Maybe this isn't the worst thing
in the world.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.514
Take some fucking time off.

44:21.692 --> 44:24.752
Go in the sun for fuck's sakes, huh?

44:25.896 --> 44:28.626
Eat a lot of fruit,
get some fucking vitamins in you.

44:28.799 --> 44:31.996
Vegetables and greens and shit.
I can't...

44:33.871 --> 44:36.965
You know, there's...
I was reading yesterday...

44:37.141 --> 44:39.666
...there's a fish,
it's called a zebra fish.

44:40.444 --> 44:42.435
Has little hairs on it.

44:42.646 --> 44:45.672
And somehow,
they can implant that...

44:48.752 --> 44:50.117
I don't know.

44:51.021 --> 44:52.511
It's too fucking hot.

44:54.358 --> 44:56.223
It's always too fucking hot.

44:59.396 --> 45:01.523
I can't help you.

45:03.100 --> 45:05.091
I don't know how to...

45:05.269 --> 45:09.569
I don't know how to help... - I don't
want to help you. I can't help you.

45:12.743 --> 45:16.008
I didn't want a deaf DJ
on the label.

45:16.180 --> 45:20.514
I didn't want the company to be
touched with the deaf stamp.

45:20.684 --> 45:22.049
Well, business is tough...

45:22.219 --> 45:24.813
...and sometimes you have
to make awkward decisions.

45:24.988 --> 45:29.288
And I've made harder decisions
than dropping the deaf DJ.

46:33.323 --> 46:35.223
Frank just locks himself up
in his room...

46:35.392 --> 46:37.622
...didn't come out
of his villa for a long time.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.286
He had this theory he was gonna
get his hearing back...

46:40.464 --> 46:43.729
...by having complete silence. He
wanted to rest his ears completely.

46:43.901 --> 46:46.995
He hired people to bring in supplies
for him to the villa.

46:47.171 --> 46:49.731
The only accounts we have
of Frank during this period...

46:49.907 --> 46:51.636
...come from various drug dealers.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.470
He was in a very dark place.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.348
I love you too.

52:38.188 --> 52:41.954
- Where is Frankie Wilde today?
- What? I haven't...

52:42.125 --> 52:45.891
I haven't talked to him
in almost a year now.

52:46.062 --> 52:49.293
I've heard some stories. This guy
supposedly saw him in New York...

52:49.466 --> 52:54.597
...wearing a garbage bag for a hat
and shoeboxes on his feet.

52:54.771 --> 52:58.605
And he... And he had a rock...

52:58.775 --> 53:01.539
...and he was trying to eat it
like a sandwich.

53:01.711 --> 53:04.976
I don't...
I don't think Frankie would do that.

53:05.148 --> 53:07.412
He looked like a bum.
He always looked like a bum.

53:07.584 --> 53:10.018
But he had a really special bond
with the homeless.

53:46.289 --> 53:47.586
Hello.

53:55.465 --> 53:56.489
Hello?

53:56.666 --> 53:57.928
Hello.

53:59.135 --> 54:02.571
Is this where you come if you
want to learn how to read lips?

54:02.739 --> 54:05.503
Of course. You want to learn?

54:09.045 --> 54:12.037
I've got no idea
what you're saying, darling.

54:12.449 --> 54:14.974
I can't hear anything.
This is the place, yeah?

54:27.931 --> 54:30.422
They look like a couple of cunts.

54:39.709 --> 54:42.075
I don't know how to lip read.

54:43.580 --> 54:45.810
Maybe you should
write something down.

54:45.982 --> 54:49.440
I can't hear you, and I can't read lips.
So we need to get started somehow.

54:49.619 --> 54:52.520
So, maybe, write something down.

55:12.542 --> 55:14.407
Temper, temper.

55:15.211 --> 55:16.872
Watch.

55:17.047 --> 55:18.878
Concentrate.

55:19.416 --> 55:21.680
Watch my lips.

55:23.219 --> 55:24.481
Watch...

55:24.654 --> 55:26.485
...lips.

55:31.561 --> 55:33.290
Tongue.

55:34.998 --> 55:36.397
Jaw.

55:39.469 --> 55:41.835
One's facial expression...

55:42.205 --> 55:44.139
...gesture.

55:44.841 --> 55:46.672
Lip reading...

55:46.843 --> 55:49.004
...is about seeing...

55:49.179 --> 55:50.737
...feeling.

55:59.356 --> 56:02.257
Fill in the blanks, Frank.

56:18.441 --> 56:20.602
Stepdad.

56:24.748 --> 56:26.409
Husband.

56:33.156 --> 56:37.115
The quick brown fox.

56:38.061 --> 56:39.585
- The.
- The.

56:39.763 --> 56:41.731
- Quick.
- Quick.

56:41.898 --> 56:44.196
- Brown.
- Brown.

56:44.367 --> 56:46.460
- Fox.
- Fox.

56:47.470 --> 56:52.908
- Jumps over the lazy...
- Over the lazy dog.

56:53.076 --> 56:54.441
Faster.

56:54.611 --> 56:57.011
The quick brown fox...

56:57.180 --> 56:59.512
...jumps over the lazy dog.

56:59.682 --> 57:01.445
Good.

57:01.618 --> 57:03.085
Good.

57:04.187 --> 57:05.848
Fucking good.

57:09.159 --> 57:11.957
They all speak English here.

57:12.162 --> 57:13.561
Don't worry.

57:20.437 --> 57:22.701
Scotch neat, please, mate.

57:24.140 --> 57:26.199
Double Scotch neat.

57:28.344 --> 57:31.313
- Is that okay?
- It's very good.

57:31.781 --> 57:34.113
See what he comes back with.

57:38.588 --> 57:40.385
To my lips.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.255
Cheers.

57:51.334 --> 57:53.234
You and me got the same hobby.

57:58.308 --> 58:00.139
Another one?

58:02.178 --> 58:04.237
What can I get you?

58:06.983 --> 58:09.884
Scotch neat, please.

58:11.020 --> 58:13.113
Double Scotch again.

58:14.491 --> 58:18.723
In England, it means "fuck off."
Very similar gesture.

58:18.895 --> 58:21.591
Fuck off. Double.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.530
Double fuck off.

58:23.867 --> 58:25.164
Waiter!

58:26.870 --> 58:29.430
Double Scotch, please, mate.

58:43.786 --> 58:45.777
No, more.

58:48.358 --> 58:52.124
What do you want to drink to?
Do you want to drink to something?

58:54.831 --> 58:56.423
Who's Simon?

58:56.599 --> 58:58.066
Silence.

58:58.835 --> 59:02.066
- Who is he?
- Not Simon, silence.

59:02.305 --> 59:04.603
- Are you finished with him?
- Good.

59:04.774 --> 59:06.241
Great.

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:04.267
I know what I could do.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:05.063
I know what I could do.

01:00:05.234 --> 01:00:06.633
I know what I could do.

01:00:06.803 --> 01:00:09.033
Fuck the DJ lark.

01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:12.902
You know on TV,
you got a little ugly bird...

01:00:13.076 --> 01:00:16.534
...bottom right-hand corner,
doing all this business?

01:00:16.713 --> 01:00:18.510
I could do that.
I could be a cool one.

01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:21.445
A cool little fucker
in the corner of the box. I could.

01:00:21.618 --> 01:00:23.745
Think positively.

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:26.447
Yeah. "Are you going down
to Pacha tonight?"

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:30.457
"Oh, no, mate. No, I'm staying in
because Frankie Wilde's...

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.187
...at the right-hand bottom corner
of the TV tonight...

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:36.230
...doing the fucking hand jive.
It'll be brilliant."

01:00:43.873 --> 01:00:45.670
You finish?

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:54.144
You finish?

01:00:55.752 --> 01:00:58.482
There's nothing wrong
with being deaf.

01:00:58.655 --> 01:01:00.145
I'm deaf.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:02.352
Trust your other senses.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:05.892
Your sight,
your smell and your touch.

01:01:06.863 --> 01:01:08.353
Just relax.

01:01:09.132 --> 01:01:10.861
It will come.

01:01:11.234 --> 01:01:13.225
It just takes time.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.265
It will come.

01:06:20.409 --> 01:06:23.606
Well, Frank's system was ingenious,
and with the weight of his sight...

01:06:23.779 --> 01:06:26.680
...he proclaims that he began
to see a rhythm in everything...

01:06:26.849 --> 01:06:29.079
...a pattern in the visual world
around him.

01:06:29.251 --> 01:06:31.651
You know, could see music.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:07:59.541
Frankie had worked with this
all his life...

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:03.075
...and then he realized
he was able to piece together...

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:06.476
...those sets
that he used to do. And...

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:11.109
Hey, presto, you know,
four to the floor, returneth.

01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:04.304
I once stole 500 quid
from your wallet, in the studio.

01:09:04.473 --> 01:09:05.939
Well...

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:08.971
...it's only money, eh? No big deal.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:11.203
And it was me
who stuck that scaff bar...

01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:13.541
...through the windscreen
of your Merc.

01:09:13.716 --> 01:09:17.412
- It wasn't that Asian kid.
- Well, he's probably out now anyway...

01:09:17.586 --> 01:09:19.850
...so no harm done.

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:23.651
I shagged Twila.

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:30.465
For three years.

01:09:46.282 --> 01:09:48.773
Because you're a mate, yeah...

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:52.883
...I only ever made love
to her bum.

01:09:55.324 --> 01:09:57.383
She doesn't like it in the bum.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:02.024
Have a listen to this.
Tell me what you think.

01:10:02.198 --> 01:10:03.597
Yeah?

01:10:15.911 --> 01:10:17.378
Open the door! Frank!

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:20.037
Frank! Open the fucking door!

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:22.480
Open the door! Frank!

01:10:22.651 --> 01:10:25.745
Frank! Open the fucking door!

01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:27.912
Do you want some more coffee?

01:10:30.759 --> 01:10:33.421
Frank! Frank! Open the door.
Open the fucking door.

01:10:34.763 --> 01:10:36.458
- So?
- Oh, Frank. Oh, God.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.099
- Yeah?
- Oh, God, it's good,

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:40.201
- Fucking good.
- It's good?

01:10:40.369 --> 01:10:42.337
Okay, it's fucking hot.

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:45.234
First off, did you...? Who's this?

01:10:45.441 --> 01:10:47.966
Max, this is Penelope.
Penelope, this is Max.

01:10:48.143 --> 01:10:49.269
Hi, Max.

01:10:50.479 --> 01:10:51.707
Hi.

01:10:54.583 --> 01:10:57.575
Forget it.
Look, Did you mix this?

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.188
- Yeah.
- Did you produce this?

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.722
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck.

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:06.027
Fuck it, Frank. It's gold.
Fucking gold.

01:11:07.563 --> 01:11:08.757
It's beautiful.

01:11:08.931 --> 01:11:10.865
Tell me! I haven't heard it.

01:11:11.033 --> 01:11:14.935
It gets in your fucking chest. I've never
heard nothing like it. Fucking:

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:17.766
Like fucking heart. It changed...

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:21.603
What...? What do you mean you
haven't heard it? What do you mean?

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:24.045
Well, I haven't heard it.

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.506
Why?

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:30.809
I'm completely deaf, Max.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.952
Completely?

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.086
Yeah.

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:41.824
Nothing.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.400
To the handicapped.

01:11:53.676 --> 01:11:55.007
Sorry.

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:02.180
The first time I heard
Hear No Evil...

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:05.184
...I was like, you know, "Whatever."

01:12:05.354 --> 01:12:09.085
But then Max told me
Frankie's story...

01:12:09.325 --> 01:12:12.351
...and the penny dropped.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:27.404
People love a good tragedy.

01:12:27.576 --> 01:12:30.511
People love handicaps, frankly.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.879
It gets them emotional, you know.

01:12:34.049 --> 01:12:37.280
So I'll get on that deaf train
with a wheelchair ramp.

01:12:37.453 --> 01:12:40.718
No problem.
First-class ticket, please.

01:13:06.348 --> 01:13:10.307
I don't see why we should limit
ourselves to deaf people, really.

01:13:10.486 --> 01:13:12.977
I don't want to reveal
too much either...

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:16.156
...about where we're going.
But it's gonna be big.

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:18.623
It's gonna be big,
and it's gonna be handicapped.

01:13:18.794 --> 01:13:20.229
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.958
Imagine all the deaf people,
all the deaf people in the world.

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.564
They need a fucking hero, Frank.

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:26.428
They don't have a fucking hero.
There's no deaf hero, huh?

01:13:26.602 --> 01:13:27.728
It's you, Frank.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.736
You're, like, the fucking link.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:35.570
You're drawing all the deaf kids
that are screaming, with no hearing.

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.974
They're yelling out to...
Who's gonna listen?

01:13:38.147 --> 01:13:41.446
Not other fucking deaf kids.
They can't hear, huh? You.

01:13:41.617 --> 01:13:44.518
You're the fucking voice, eh?
And wait.

01:13:44.686 --> 01:13:47.849
Wait. You're gonna love this.

01:13:49.658 --> 01:13:52.684
Can you hear me?
"No, I can't hear you, Max.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:56.024
Are you trying to make me money?"
Yes. I'm making you money. Okay.

01:13:56.198 --> 01:13:57.495
Fuck, look...

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:01.124
...that is just the fucking beginning.

01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:22.351
I wouldn't put my name to any
old product. If I could describe it...

01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:26.019
...as bad speed in a can.

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.856
We've all had bad speed,
haven't we?

01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:30.464
I'm just gonna have a sip.
I can't resist.

01:14:31.333 --> 01:14:32.425
Fuck.

01:14:33.802 --> 01:14:36.771
He made disabilities cool.

01:14:39.741 --> 01:14:41.538
What's with the fucking ear?

01:14:41.710 --> 01:14:45.305
The ear, that represents
your deafness, okay.

01:14:45.481 --> 01:14:48.314
Deaf people hate their ears, see.
Don't they? See?

01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.509
So it's symbolic.
So you're gonna smash it.

01:14:50.686 --> 01:14:54.645
The deaf kids are gonna go fucking
nuts. Don't actually hit the ear...

01:14:54.823 --> 01:14:57.849
...because I'll put some glass on that
and turn that into a table.

01:14:58.026 --> 01:15:01.427
It's wank. I'm sucking
deaf cock for you, mate...

01:15:01.597 --> 01:15:06.398
...and I'm fucking choking on it.
- All right, first off, okay...

01:15:06.568 --> 01:15:08.092
...you're sucking show-biz cock.

01:15:08.270 --> 01:15:11.933
But look, this is gonna be
good money. This is all about cash.

01:15:12.107 --> 01:15:14.871
Shitloads of cash, Frank.
And better than that...

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:18.410
...Sonya can't get her grubby fingers
on this fucking money, understand?

01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:21.777
- This is Sonya-free cash.
- He's not a whore!

01:15:27.756 --> 01:15:29.189
Look, Frank, okay?

01:15:29.892 --> 01:15:32.622
You're not giving me any
fucking positive feedback.

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:35.922
I need fucking... You know what really
fucking bothers me about you?

01:15:36.098 --> 01:15:38.328
The fact that you think art
just fucking happens.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.866
It's just free.
Like these people just took out...

01:15:41.036 --> 01:15:43.596
...time from their fucking day
to come down here...

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:46.707
...and do a bunch of shit for nothing.
What you gotta realize...

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:49.309
...is you're a hero.
That's what the yellow's about.

01:15:49.478 --> 01:15:52.038
You make fun of me on that jacket.
I picked that jacket.

01:15:52.214 --> 01:15:55.012
Deaf kids all over the world
are gonna see that yellow.

01:15:55.183 --> 01:15:58.346
They'll run out, they'll buy that jacket.
Two, maybe $300.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.420
They're gonna run around,
proudly deaf...

01:16:00.589 --> 01:16:03.114
...all just yellow,
fluorescently deaf...

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.364
Sit down.

01:16:20.842 --> 01:16:23.208
Charlize Bondo, Ibiza Beat.

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:26.313
Frankie, can you really DJ
as a deaf man?

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.312
How is that possible?

01:16:30.552 --> 01:16:32.816
- They murmuring?
- Yeah, quite a bit.

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:34.785
I'm an honest man.

01:16:34.957 --> 01:16:38.017
And I can tell you
that this album was made...

01:16:39.695 --> 01:16:42.994
...completely without the aid
of my ears.

01:16:43.632 --> 01:16:48.194
And at Pacha next week,
I'll be DJ'ing as a deaf man.

01:16:49.972 --> 01:16:52.304
And if you don't believe me...

01:16:53.208 --> 01:16:55.301
...you know, fuck you...

01:16:56.612 --> 01:17:01.640
...because I've got nothing,
nothing to prove...

01:17:01.817 --> 01:17:06.379
...to you sluts at all.
- Okay. Okay. Role model.

01:17:07.956 --> 01:17:10.857
- Nothing.
- Wait a minute. Okay, role model.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:14.185
Listen. Listen to me. No. No.

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:16.729
He loves sluts. Frank loves sluts.

01:17:17.332 --> 01:17:19.892
Now, I think what
he's trying to say is...

01:17:20.068 --> 01:17:23.094
...even though he feels
he has nothing to prove to you...

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:29.540
...he'd be happy to prove
anything you want, to you.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:34.871
It's important that we all realize that
this is a major comeback from a rock.

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:39.817
You know, what he's accomplished
in the last few months is astonishing.

01:17:39.988 --> 01:17:42.889
He'll be at the Pacha nightclub.
You can come down...

01:17:43.058 --> 01:17:45.526
...and watch him mix yourself...

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:48.094
...and watch the miracle
happen, okay?

01:17:48.263 --> 01:17:52.563
Because, you know, I realize, okay,
that there are doubters in this room...

01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:55.703
...which fucks me up.
Because, you know...

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:58.567
...why would someone
pretend to be deaf?

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:02.005
I mean, that's retarded.
That's ridic...

01:18:02.177 --> 01:18:06.637
It's not like he's fucking benefiting
from this. It's a fucking obstacle.

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:09.215
He can't hear a fuck...
Your mom's a cunt. Nothing.

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:12.911
Zero. Blank. This man,
what he's done, fucking...

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:17.024
It gets me in my fucking heart,
what he's done. And you...

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:21.253
You come down here, and you
put on this big fucking show...

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.455
...like he's gonna
fucking make shit up!

01:18:23.632 --> 01:18:25.998
Relax. Relax, man.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:28.129
All right. Next question.

01:18:28.503 --> 01:18:30.562
One more! One more!

01:18:41.616 --> 01:18:44.551
I thought it was amazing,
you know, that somebody...

01:18:44.720 --> 01:18:48.121
...that's deaf can actually...
Can actually...

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.882
...you know, be a DJ.

01:18:50.058 --> 01:18:52.424
- Frankie Wilde, good luck.
- Good luck.

01:18:52.594 --> 01:18:56.860
I just think that guy is so fantastic.
He has a gift that no one else has.

01:18:57.032 --> 01:18:59.466
And somehow, he is gonna do it.

01:19:16.985 --> 01:19:19.215
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

01:19:26.094 --> 01:19:27.994
The vibe that night
was incredible.

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:31.991
All the memories had come back,
you know. He'd hit the depths...

01:19:32.167 --> 01:19:34.533
...then he was just back.

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:51.418
Pacha, Frankie Wilde, comeback.

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:54.244
"Take this. Check this out."

01:19:54.422 --> 01:19:56.890
I've never seen an atmosphere
like it. It was amazing.

01:19:58.326 --> 01:20:00.556
Frankie! Frankie! Frankie!

01:22:01.549 --> 01:22:04.143
He probably never thought
he'd ever feel that again.

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:07.186
And to come back
and actually feel that and more...

01:22:08.189 --> 01:22:10.817
...it was a great experience.
Everybody in the room...

01:22:10.992 --> 01:22:13.927
...shared the same experience.
It was really, really special.

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.495
It was kind of what
dance music's about, really.

01:22:24.072 --> 01:22:26.540
He just had clubland sparking,
bigtime.

01:22:37.485 --> 01:22:39.885
He just took the roof
off the place. It was amazing.

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:42.319
It was like
he was an even better DJ...

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:45.425
...as a deaf man than he'd
been before. It was incredible.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:57.363
Frankie! Frankie!
We won it! Listen!

01:22:57.539 --> 01:22:59.632
Fuck! We're the fucking champions!

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.799
We got the fucking award!

01:23:02.444 --> 01:23:05.971
This is it.
This is our fucking moment!

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:09.340
There's nothing... I can't... Fuck.

01:23:09.517 --> 01:23:11.144
What do you wanna do,
buy the moon?

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:14.720
We'll buy the moon! Doesn't matter.
You don't understand, it's huge.

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:16.413
Hold on.

01:23:23.365 --> 01:23:25.697
Okay, they're gonna come in.
Fifteen minutes.

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.858
They all wanna talk to you.
Fifteen minutes.

01:23:28.036 --> 01:23:30.402
Fifteen minutes, Frank.
This is a big moment.

01:23:30.572 --> 01:23:33.439
Listen, it's important.
Fifteen minutes. That's all they need.

01:23:33.608 --> 01:23:35.576
Tomorrow,
big, fucking press conference.

01:23:35.744 --> 01:23:38.372
That's what we're gonna do.
Very important, okay?

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:39.979
- You have to watch.
- Max?

01:23:40.148 --> 01:23:42.412
- What? What?
- Can you do me a favor, mate?

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:44.552
Anything. Anything.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.516
Could you leave us alone
for 10 minutes?

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:49.156
No. See, you're not listening.
Okay, listen to me.

01:23:49.324 --> 01:23:50.916
Look at my lips, okay? Okay?

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:54.220
They come in for 15 minutes
of your life. Fifteen minutes.

01:23:54.496 --> 01:23:56.589
Fifteen fucking minutes. Frank.

01:23:56.765 --> 01:23:59.563
No, no, no, no. Frank, no.
No. Frank.

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:04.199
Frank, 10 minutes. Ten minutes.

01:24:06.441 --> 01:24:07.965
Ten minutes.

01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:13.804
Sure. Okay.

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:18.043
Yeah. Fucking sure.
What the fuck do I know?

01:24:32.967 --> 01:24:34.867
Okay, now. All right, now.
Calm down.

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.163
Okay, you're getting in, buddy.
Don't worry.

01:24:37.338 --> 01:24:40.830
You I used to like. All right.
You could do with some cheering up.

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.910
All right. Okay. Hold on. Okay.

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:49.211
Frankie?

01:24:51.119 --> 01:24:52.450
Frankie!

01:25:04.799 --> 01:25:06.699
Jesus Christ.

01:25:18.546 --> 01:25:20.013
Frankie!

01:25:25.019 --> 01:25:27.010
Frank! Fuck.

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:22.935
There was like a flat line.

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:25.208
It was...

01:26:26.114 --> 01:26:28.378
Still, to this day, I'm...

01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:33.983
That was it, gone.
Frankie Wilde, bye-bye. Gone.

01:26:34.656 --> 01:26:36.954
And everybody was like that:
Holding the baby.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:09.913
I've heard a story that he's running
a record shop in Oxford.

01:27:10.091 --> 01:27:13.618
There's a story that he went to Fiji
and then died of syphilis.

01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:16.730
But nobody knows. You know,
I don't know where he is.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:20.762
He was another deaf guy
with a deaf guy's needs.

01:27:21.369 --> 01:27:23.667
And he went off...

01:27:23.838 --> 01:27:26.033
...to a quiet place.

01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:28.932
Although, I suppose that
wouldn't make much difference.
