00:06.240 --> 00:08.160
(BELLS JANGLE)

00:13.000 --> 00:14.920
(WIND HOWLS)

00:16.320 --> 00:19.240
Hello, and welcome
to a Grand Tour special,

00:19.280 --> 00:20.800
which comes to you from

00:20.840 --> 00:26.040
the emptiest, most sparsely
populated country on Earth.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.320
Mongolia.

00:29.360 --> 00:30.800
(ENGINE REVVING)

00:30.840 --> 00:32.760
(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

00:42.200 --> 00:45.600
Now, ordinarily when we
go on these adventures,

00:45.640 --> 00:50.560
we have a vague idea
about the sort of things
that we might be doing.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.680
But this time, we don't.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.200
RICHARD: No, not a clue.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.880
The situation is,
we took off from

00:56.920 --> 00:59.960
the capital city of
Mongolia, Ulaanbaatar,

01:00.000 --> 01:01.720
and flew for two,
two-and-a-half hours,

01:01.760 --> 01:04.040
over terrain
that was much like this.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.440
Actually, quite familiar.

01:06.480 --> 01:07.880
Unthreatening.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.680
But it was completely empty.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.680
It was like flying over the
whole of the British Isles

01:14.720 --> 01:18.400
and not seeing a town,
a village, a road,

01:18.440 --> 01:20.680
a powerline, a quarry,
not even a farm.

01:20.720 --> 01:25.560
There wasn't a shred of
evidence, from what we saw
out of the aeroplane window,

01:25.640 --> 01:28.840
that man has ever existed.

01:28.880 --> 01:30.960
Yeah, this is what the world
would have looked like,

01:31.000 --> 01:34.240
pretty much,
on about page three of the
Book of Genesis, I reckon.

01:34.280 --> 01:37.320
And then
we were dropped off here...

01:37.360 --> 01:39.280
(CHUCKLES)
...and we don't know why.

01:39.320 --> 01:40.720
We don't know anything.

01:42.360 --> 01:45.120
An hour or so later,
though...

01:45.160 --> 01:47.400
(CAMERA POWERING UP)

01:49.640 --> 01:52.080
(WHIRRING OF ROTOR BLADES)

01:52.120 --> 01:53.360
That's a chopper.

01:54.560 --> 01:56.080
-There, look.
-Yeah.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.360
Why isn't he landing?

02:10.400 --> 02:11.560
What's he doing?

02:20.760 --> 02:22.440
-Whoa, look at this.
-Look!

02:22.520 --> 02:24.440
RICHARD: Hang on a minute.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.600
(WIND WHISTLING)

02:30.800 --> 02:32.760
-Whoa.
-Look at that.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.720
What's he dropping?

02:42.880 --> 02:45.080
JEREMY: It's got to be
supplies. Firewood...

02:45.120 --> 02:46.680
RICHARD: Food.
JEREMY: Shelter.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.080
JAMES: Hats.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.720
-Hats?
-Well, you need a hat.
It's sunny.

02:49.760 --> 02:51.360
They're not gonna
fly out hats to us.

02:53.720 --> 02:55.520
So that... He's...
That's him gone, then.

02:55.560 --> 02:58.480
-He's not landing.
RICHARD: Oh.

02:58.520 --> 03:00.400
Does that mean
we're not going home, then?

03:00.440 --> 03:04.360
RICHARD: James, the
helicopter has buggered off.

03:04.400 --> 03:07.640
And we're alone with
three boxes full of quiche
or something.

03:07.680 --> 03:09.600
Well, let's go
and have a look, then.

03:12.040 --> 03:14.320
JEREMY: I mean, what
we really need is transport.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.560
RICHARD:
Yeah. That would be useful.

03:16.600 --> 03:18.320
JAMES: They haven't
got cars in them.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.400
-Could you get a car in that?
-No, look, it's thin.

03:20.440 --> 03:21.680
It's only about that wide.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.160
-So this is
the webbing that...
-Well, that comes off.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.400
Oh, hello, there's a crowbar
there. So that's...

03:30.440 --> 03:31.520
Good.

03:31.560 --> 03:33.160
Right, lifting it here.

03:36.760 --> 03:38.720
-That's it.
-Stand clear.

03:39.800 --> 03:40.800
Oh!

03:42.000 --> 03:43.920
-Well...
-Water.

03:45.920 --> 03:48.200
-What's in...
-The hell...

03:48.240 --> 03:51.040
Oh, shit. Is that an engine?

03:51.080 --> 03:52.800
That's an engine.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.760
A TDi of some sort.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.240
Vehicle lights?

04:02.680 --> 04:04.600
JEREMY: That is a rear axle.
RICHARD: It is.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.080
That's a master cylinder.

04:07.120 --> 04:10.840
Guys, I don't need to look
in the other one.

04:10.880 --> 04:14.560
We've an engine,
we've headlights,
we've a rear axle.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.840
There's enough spare parts
to build a car.

04:19.480 --> 04:21.040
-Yeah.
-Oh, come on.

04:21.080 --> 04:23.520
What, here?

04:23.560 --> 04:26.800
JEREMY: As the other two
opened the third crate,

04:26.800 --> 04:29.800
I found a mysterious bag.

04:35.920 --> 04:39.040
OK, well, straight away,
that's a windscreen.

04:39.080 --> 04:40.520
Which confirms it.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.880
-Yep.
-Guys...

04:41.920 --> 04:43.240
What is it, a Land Rover?

04:43.320 --> 04:46.640
-What's that?
-I have a letter.

04:46.680 --> 04:50.120
The nearest civilisation
is a town called Moron.

04:50.160 --> 04:52.760
-Is it?
-There's a surprise.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.600
"It's hundreds of miles away.

04:54.640 --> 04:59.720
In order to reach it,
you must build the contents
of these boxes.

04:59.760 --> 05:03.440
You have enough food
and water for seven days."

05:05.360 --> 05:06.640
What's that?

05:11.640 --> 05:13.640
RICHARD: That's the town.
JEREMY: Moron.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.920
-And that's the start.
JEREMY: We're here.

05:16.000 --> 05:18.200
It says "Map not to scale."

05:18.240 --> 05:19.640
JEREMY: There's a surprise.

05:19.680 --> 05:22.880
This has been drawn
by EH Shepard.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.160
Look, "Rather Boggy and Sad."

05:25.200 --> 05:26.760
"Deep River of Despair."

05:26.800 --> 05:29.000
-"Floody Place."
-"Lots of Trees."

05:29.040 --> 05:32.120
"Wibbly Wobbly Bridge",
"Very Big Crack".

05:32.160 --> 05:33.440
Well, that's not very useful,
is it?

05:33.480 --> 05:34.960
Well, we've got to go
northeast, haven't we?

05:35.000 --> 05:36.440
But how far is that?

05:36.480 --> 05:38.680
Well, we don't know.
He said "hundreds of miles".

05:38.720 --> 05:40.600
Yes, but first...

05:40.640 --> 05:44.400
-What?
-All we need to do is
assemble this lot into a car.

05:44.440 --> 05:48.120
RICHARD: As there was
no instruction manual,

05:48.160 --> 05:51.040
May and I began to
go through the components.

05:51.080 --> 05:53.400
This is chassis, isn't it?
But it's in two halves.

05:53.440 --> 05:57.240
While our mechanically inept
colleague made himself useful

05:57.280 --> 05:59.360
by moaning about
the camping equipment.

06:00.440 --> 06:02.600
That's not a bed!

06:02.640 --> 06:04.080
-It's a mattress.
-In...

06:04.120 --> 06:06.200
-It's not a mattress!
-It is.

06:06.240 --> 06:07.600
If you go to
Peter Jones and say,

06:07.640 --> 06:09.240
"Can I have a mattress?"
they don't give you this.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.280
-The heaviest bit
is the engine...
-Yes.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.840
...which is over there,
so we need to take
the other bits over there.

06:13.880 --> 06:15.880
-Yes, that's
a very good idea.
-Let's do that.

06:15.920 --> 06:17.840
(JEREMY WAILS SPOOKILY)

06:17.880 --> 06:20.120
-Jeremy's pretending
to be a ghost.
-I'll pretend to be scared.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.000
To be a ghost,
you first have to be dead.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.160
RICHARD: Nice work.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.360
So what we should do
is lay everything out.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.120
Why not put the parachute out
as a dust sheet, put it all
on the parachute?

06:31.160 --> 06:33.160
Good idea.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.000
If we lay it out, it can be
the floor of our workshop.

06:37.040 --> 06:39.840
-If either of you
have any emergencies...
-No!

06:39.880 --> 06:41.600
-Hey, Hammond.
-Yeah?

06:41.640 --> 06:44.000
-It's a Land Rover engine,
you'll be pleased to know.
-Is it?

06:44.040 --> 06:46.600
JEREMY: "Hey, Hammond.
Hey, Hammond."

06:46.640 --> 06:50.040
-Why don't you do something
useful? Unwrap something.
-"Hey, Hammond.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.040
Hammond."

06:53.000 --> 06:54.680
JEREMY: As my colleagues
fiddled about

06:54.720 --> 06:56.600
with stuff
I didn't understand...

06:56.640 --> 06:59.080
That says
"Chassis mid-section."

06:59.120 --> 07:01.560
...I found something
that I did.

07:01.600 --> 07:02.800
Hello!

07:04.120 --> 07:05.760
I wasn't expecting that.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.920
However, there was a problem.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.360
-Just pop that down
for a second.
-Yes.

07:10.400 --> 07:13.000
-This is a box of rations,
OK?
-Yes.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.840
Now, forgive me
but I could swear...

07:18.720 --> 07:20.120
RICHARD: Oh, God.

07:20.160 --> 07:23.120
-Why would Wilman do that?
-Because he's evil.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.600
Why would he send us a car
in bits that isn't a car?

07:25.640 --> 07:27.680
I don't care about
the car in bits.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.600
He and both of you, actually,
are quite capable of
doing that.

07:31.640 --> 07:35.040
This, on the other hand,
is a catastrophe.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.840
-How many of those
have you found?
-One.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.840
Why don't you
trouble yourself
with matters food-related?

07:40.880 --> 07:43.560
-That's a good idea.
-Gather it together in one
place, see what we've got.

07:43.600 --> 07:47.840
So, I see. So I become
food and beverage manager
of the project?

07:47.880 --> 07:49.720
-If you want to call it that.
-If you like.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.480
A bit like Robert De Niro
in Casino.

07:51.520 --> 07:53.000
In every conceivable way.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.240
He was the food and beverage
manager of the casino.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.400
And I shall be the food
and beverage manager
of our little project.

07:58.440 --> 08:00.200
OK, from now on
we'll call you Robert.

08:00.240 --> 08:02.080
-Why don't you gather all
the food-related things...
-Thank you.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.640
-Off you go, Robert.
-It's my middle name.

08:03.680 --> 08:07.040
-Mr De Niro.
-Mr De Niro, yes.
That'll be great.

08:07.080 --> 08:11.120
RICHARD: Whilst the raging
baboon went off to sort
the food and beverages,

08:12.880 --> 08:17.040
James and I continued to
unpack the components.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.720
JAMES: Oh, wait a minute,
that's got pedals
attached to it.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.080
-Oh, yeah.
-So that's the bulkhead
essentially.

08:26.440 --> 08:30.440
And eventually the giant
Airfix kit was laid out.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.840
That's where
we will build it.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.320
This is our workshop.

08:35.360 --> 08:37.200
JAMES: I would say we've got
hundreds of components,

08:37.240 --> 08:38.640
not including fasteners
and things.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.080
JEREMY: Meanwhile,
in the lee of a nearby hill,

08:44.120 --> 08:46.640
I had been very
busy as well.

08:46.720 --> 08:49.200
Right,
I've got the campsite built.

08:49.240 --> 08:51.520
Two tents here
for the snorers.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.600
One over there for me,
so I can't hear them.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.400
There's the lavatory.
And now...

08:57.440 --> 08:59.200
I'm gonna start work
on lunch.

08:59.240 --> 09:01.720
Which meant making fire.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.440
Yes.
(STRAINED) Yes!

09:07.480 --> 09:09.240
Please!

09:09.280 --> 09:11.240
So, gearbox on.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.120
-Yeah.
-Yep.

09:13.160 --> 09:15.880
RICHARD: Back at base,
we were doing well...

09:15.880 --> 09:18.280
There, that's it, whoa.

09:18.320 --> 09:21.840
...even though James
was being very annoying.

09:21.880 --> 09:23.480
Hang on, let's just think
about where all...

09:23.520 --> 09:25.160
We haven't got the nuts and
bloody fasteners ready.

09:25.200 --> 09:28.080
Let's just get on with it.
Get it lined up.

09:28.120 --> 09:30.160
OK.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.760
-That's quite good.
-Offer it up.

09:31.760 --> 09:33.840
Push forwards. Yes.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.440
-Oh-ho-ho!
-Well done.

09:38.600 --> 09:40.200
-Hey, James.
-21.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.880
I've got a metal willy.

09:42.960 --> 09:45.040
RICHARD:
Captain OCD, however,

09:45.080 --> 09:47.400
was not in the mood
for willy gags.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.480
Where the chuffing hell
has it gone?

09:50.520 --> 09:52.640
This is why you put 'em back
in the same place.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.160
Where did you put it
last time you had the 19?

09:55.200 --> 09:56.880
-Oh, for God's sake...
-Ratchet.

09:56.880 --> 09:59.040
...just find any (BLEEP)
spanner?

10:00.520 --> 10:02.280
JEREMY: With absolutely
no help at all

10:02.320 --> 10:04.400
from the cameraman's
lighter,

10:04.440 --> 10:06.360
I had struck gold.

10:06.400 --> 10:08.320
I have made fire!

10:11.880 --> 10:13.120
Right.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.200
Right, what have we got?

10:19.240 --> 10:23.400
These are British Army
rations. Oh, God!

10:23.440 --> 10:25.880
I'm... I've stuck my knife
through that one.

10:25.960 --> 10:29.600
So the water's gonna get
in there and spoil it a bit.

10:29.640 --> 10:33.000
Tropical fruit and nut mix.
Mm, I like that.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.120
I might just deny
this was ever in it.

10:38.640 --> 10:39.760
Mm.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.320
Lift.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.840
So that goes up,
axle goes underneath.

10:44.880 --> 10:48.760
Lower it down on that,
Bob will be our uncle.

10:48.840 --> 10:50.760
-Straighten up.
-Yeah.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.440
-There you go.
-Bump stop on.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.360
RICHARD: After many hours
of hard work,

10:59.400 --> 11:02.000
we had made
cracking progress.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.880
-It is on its own wheels.
-Rolling chassis!

11:04.920 --> 11:06.560
Look at that!

11:06.600 --> 11:08.040
Which meant we were famished

11:08.080 --> 11:10.840
when Mr De Niro
finally got back.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.000
-Chaps.
-Hello.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.160
-I've got your lunch.
-Oh, about bloody time.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.800
-Oh, sorry it's a bit late.
-Yeah, it's tea really,
isn't it?

11:16.840 --> 11:19.600
That's yours and mine.
They were the same.
But, no, it's...

11:20.720 --> 11:22.360
What's this?

11:22.400 --> 11:24.080
It looks like cat sick.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.160
It should look like that.
That's how it is.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.600
But the bag
may have got a bit snicked.

11:28.640 --> 11:32.400
Unfortunately, I licked that,
so this is mine.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.760
It's stone cold, man.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.320
What have you been doing
all this time?

11:35.360 --> 11:38.160
Well, I might ask you
the same question.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.760
I have built a town, a sewage
system and a restaurant.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.600
I have cooked in
the restaurant and I
have brought you your food.

11:44.640 --> 11:47.400
-Which is cold.
-You meanwhile
have bolted some wheels.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.840
You've done
literally nothing.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.280
Are you kidding?
We've got a rolling chassis.
We've got the engine in.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.800
How do you think we did that
and got those axles on?

11:54.840 --> 11:57.440
-All right, start it up.
-It doesn't go yet.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.080
We would have
got a bit further on

11:59.120 --> 12:01.120
if we hadn't insisted on
lining up the damn...

12:01.160 --> 12:03.360
-I haven't been
lining up the tools.
-You did. You did.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.280
-I've been saying...
-We would have spent
more time...

12:05.320 --> 12:06.800
...keep the fasteners
in the right place,

12:06.840 --> 12:09.120
otherwise Hammond
puts the wrong ones in.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.760
You're talking over
each other. Can you do it
one at a time?

12:11.800 --> 12:14.120
The one that you wanted
was over here in the dust.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.840
I am making
an executive decision here.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.280
-Hammond is in charge of
the build of this car.
-What?

12:19.320 --> 12:22.200
You can't make Hammond
in charge of the build.
You're not in a position to.

12:22.240 --> 12:24.360
-We have to have
a vote on it.
-Listen.

12:24.400 --> 12:27.480
I don't know how to build
a car, so that's me out, OK?

12:27.520 --> 12:29.880
You, May, you do know
how to build a car

12:29.920 --> 12:32.080
but it'll take you six
months, so you're out.

12:32.120 --> 12:35.520
Hammond, he sort of
knows how to build a car
but he'll do it quickly.

12:35.560 --> 12:36.960
So he has to be in charge.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.920
He has to get you speeded up.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.960
-OK, I'm only doing what
Hammond tells me to do.
-Right, good.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.680
Sir, not wishing to
speak out of turn

12:43.720 --> 12:45.560
but is there any reason
why I shouldn't do that

12:45.600 --> 12:47.240
with an extension
on a socket wrench, sir?

12:47.280 --> 12:49.960
-Stop calling me "sir"
and just...
-Just... James...

12:50.000 --> 12:51.800
He doesn't know
what he's doing.

12:51.840 --> 12:54.840
Would either of you two
like a beer? Would that
calm you down?

12:54.880 --> 12:56.120
-Oh, yes.
-Yes, it would.

12:56.160 --> 12:57.360
Right, as food
and beverages manager,

12:57.400 --> 12:58.440
I shall go
and get you one.

12:58.480 --> 13:01.240
I'll have a beer, please,
Robert.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.440
JEREMY: With the promise of
beer, harmony was restored.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.240
So this should line up.

13:06.280 --> 13:08.560
It does.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.280
So we've got
two different lengths,
three different lengths...

13:13.320 --> 13:15.600
RICHARD: Let's move it
and then go forwards.

13:15.640 --> 13:18.720
Wait. Move forwards.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.360
JAMES: Hang on. There's
a cable or something.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.320
RICHARD:
That's the axle breather.

13:23.720 --> 13:25.720
Just move it
and then go forwards.

13:25.760 --> 13:26.960
(JEREMY HUMS)

13:31.040 --> 13:32.840
Er...

13:32.880 --> 13:34.800
-What are you looking for?
-What are you doing?

13:34.840 --> 13:38.880
I've searched everywhere.
They haven't sent any beer.

13:38.920 --> 13:43.200
Or gin or wine
or alcohol of any sort.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.320
Is that serious
or is that a joke?

13:45.360 --> 13:46.920
MAN: No, it's serious.

13:51.080 --> 13:53.320
-Seriously there isn't any?
-No beer.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.560
No alcohol, nothing.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.960
And it's seven days away?

13:58.000 --> 14:01.920
-We've got...
It takes seven...
-And it's six o'clock.

14:01.960 --> 14:04.560
How long is it gonna
take you to build this?

14:04.600 --> 14:06.720
It's now five past six.

14:06.760 --> 14:08.720
Well, we're not going to be
finished tonight, are we?

14:08.760 --> 14:10.240
We're not gonna
finish it tonight.

14:12.680 --> 14:16.800
JAMES: Spurred on
by the catastrophic
alcohol situation...

14:16.840 --> 14:18.960
Bulkhead support.
Bulkhead support!

14:19.000 --> 14:22.440
...Hammond and I
put in a big shift.

14:22.480 --> 14:25.440
And then, tired and hungry,
we went to the camp

14:25.480 --> 14:29.120
for some more of Mr De Niro's
gourmet catering.

14:29.160 --> 14:31.120
Right, now, what do you
want for supper?

14:31.160 --> 14:35.600
-What have you got?
-You can have hot chocolate
drink, regular flavour.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.120
-For dinner?
-Well, biscuits, fruit?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.880
Again, for dinner?

14:40.920 --> 14:42.320
I didn't provide this.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.440
Well, there's some sort of
curry-based things here.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.800
-Do you want those?
-I don't like curry.

14:46.840 --> 14:48.480
-You do like curry.
-Not really.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.840
You're just being obtuse,
Hammond.

14:49.880 --> 14:51.960
You're in a bad temper
because you're not drunk.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.320
I'm not sure this is how
you're supposed to cook it.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.160
It isn't. You put them in
boiling water
but I couldn't be bothered.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.000
Well, why didn't you rig up
a way of putting that pan
over the fire?

15:07.040 --> 15:08.680
-Well, you...
-With some water in it,
then...

15:08.720 --> 15:10.800
Who built the wigwam fire?
You did.

15:10.840 --> 15:14.440
Well, why didn't you make
a hangy thing for the pan?

15:14.480 --> 15:16.160
Out of what, mountains?

15:16.200 --> 15:18.000
Just...

15:20.200 --> 15:22.960
Eugh, God.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.280
-It's still freezing.
-I know.

15:26.320 --> 15:29.040
JEREMY: Not only
was dinner cold and terrible,

15:29.080 --> 15:31.000
it was also rather boring.

15:34.280 --> 15:37.560
What do people talk about
when they don't drink?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.200
-I don't know actually.
-(SPITS)

15:39.240 --> 15:40.800
It's a good point.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.040
Brexit?

15:43.080 --> 15:45.800
JEREMY: We've worked together
now for many years.

15:45.840 --> 15:48.840
And we've never struggled
to think of anything
to say before.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.680
But I think that's partly
because we can never remember
what we said last time.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.480
-So we just do it again.
-Yeah, that's a fact, that.

15:54.520 --> 15:57.560
What, you're saying we've
just been repeating ourselves
every night for the last--

15:57.600 --> 15:59.160
Yes, that's possible.

16:08.280 --> 16:10.080
JEREMY: Because
we hadn't had any booze,

16:10.120 --> 16:13.640
we woke the next morning
looking ten years younger.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.400
Ready? Oh, down a bit.

16:24.440 --> 16:28.200
Hammond and May
then went off to work.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.440
-This is the canopy
fixing kit.
-That's the one.

16:31.480 --> 16:34.640
And later, I turned up
with a hearty breakfast.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.320
Of water.

16:40.520 --> 16:44.120
Can I just say, what you've
built here appears to have
a central driving position.

16:44.160 --> 16:45.360
-It does.
-Yes.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.560
-It's mid-engined.
-Yes.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.160
-It's a McLaren F1.
-It's a McLaren...

16:49.200 --> 16:50.320
Except it's four-wheel-drive.

16:50.360 --> 16:52.480
So it has a sort of
Lamborghini quality.

16:52.520 --> 16:55.120
I mean, when we get
the bodywork on it...

16:55.160 --> 16:57.320
-Ah.
-Yeah, that's a good point.

16:57.360 --> 16:59.280
There isn't any bodywork
as such.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.520
No. The plan is for us
to improvise bodywork

17:02.560 --> 17:05.200
out of the wood that
came in the crates.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.800
That's the only thing
there is to use.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.160
-What, turn the crates
into a body?
-That's all we've got.

17:09.200 --> 17:12.080
-Yeah.
-Red, white and blue?

17:12.080 --> 17:15.280
Don't say red and white
because they remind me
of wine.

17:15.320 --> 17:17.800
No, red, white...
Pink is wine.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.080
Drink is clear. It's gin.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.520
It's good for you.
It's healthy.

17:22.560 --> 17:24.520
-Yeah, it's done you
a lot of good.
-A natural product.

17:26.960 --> 17:30.000
James and Richard
then cracked on
with the oily stuff.

17:31.080 --> 17:33.080
Yes.

17:33.160 --> 17:35.960
And, since it didn't require
any actual skill,

17:36.000 --> 17:38.200
I was allowed to
help make the body.

17:43.080 --> 17:47.040
-I have made a door!
RICHARD: You have.
That is a door. Brilliant.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.640
I am a manufacturer of doors!

17:51.400 --> 17:53.280
JAMES: As he set about
making another one...

17:53.320 --> 17:56.400
Give it four or five pumps
and then hold your foot on.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.000
No bubbles. Good.

17:58.040 --> 17:59.920
...Richard and I
were working on the brakes,

17:59.960 --> 18:02.280
the lights and the roof.

18:02.320 --> 18:07.440
Oh, yeah. We just need to
gather it up and tie it off
in corners and things.

18:07.480 --> 18:09.320
That'll keep the sun off.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.760
Our plan was to get finished

18:10.800 --> 18:13.560
and get moving
by early afternoon.

18:16.000 --> 18:20.880
But at the end of the day,
the situation was not good.

18:20.920 --> 18:24.440
-So all that wiring has
got to be connected up?
RICHARD: Yeah.

18:24.480 --> 18:26.160
I haven't even got
the back lights on yet.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.000
There's loads of wires.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.000
Well, there's no way
we're gonna get
that done tonight.

18:30.040 --> 18:31.240
-No.
-No.

18:31.280 --> 18:33.080
Again.

18:33.080 --> 18:37.080
Phil, it said in that letter
from Mr Wilman

18:37.160 --> 18:39.920
that it was hundreds of miles
to this town called Moron.

18:39.960 --> 18:42.280
How many hundreds? Seriously.

18:42.320 --> 18:44.080
To be honest with you,
I haven't got a clue.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.560
So it could be 500?

18:45.640 --> 18:47.080
It... I'd say more than that.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.880
-More?
-What?

18:48.920 --> 18:52.640
How much of it is on,
like, paved roads where
we can make progress?

18:52.680 --> 18:55.320
-None. None of it.
-None?

18:55.320 --> 18:56.920
-There's no roads?
-No.

18:56.960 --> 18:58.640
But you've got
an off-road vehicle.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.040
Yes, I know.
But we've only got...

19:00.080 --> 19:02.320
What is it? ...five
days of provisions left.

19:02.400 --> 19:04.720
-Yeah.
-And that's if we
can get it going tomorrow.

19:04.760 --> 19:08.880
-We'll have to do...
at least 100 miles a day...
-Yeah.

19:08.920 --> 19:10.960
-...off road in that...
-Yeah.

19:11.000 --> 19:13.080
...or we'll starve to death.

19:13.160 --> 19:16.280
Well, that's if it's
500 miles. What if
it's 600 miles?

19:16.320 --> 19:19.080
-We'll have to do more.
-We don't know.

19:19.080 --> 19:24.000
JAMES: All we did know was
that we'd have yet another
night in Mr De Niro's hotel,

19:24.040 --> 19:26.760
using up yet more
valuable rations.

19:38.320 --> 19:41.080
So that's the main fuse.
That comes off the battery,
doesn't it?

19:41.160 --> 19:44.520
The next morning we rose
at five to finish the job.

19:44.560 --> 19:46.560
There's technical stuff
in there.

19:46.640 --> 19:49.960
And then, having built
two boots for all
our provisions...

19:50.000 --> 19:52.040
Nothing is to be wasted.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.720
Everything is to be taken.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.880
...our car
was finally finished.

20:11.160 --> 20:14.320
And since our lives
depended on not crashing,

20:14.400 --> 20:20.000
Jeremy and I secretly agreed
that Hammond should never
be allowed to drive it.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.640
-Right, this is it.
-Here we go.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.800
(ENGINE STARTS)

20:27.800 --> 20:29.800
JAMES: Yes!
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

20:29.800 --> 20:31.440
RICHARD:
Oh, my God, it works!

20:31.480 --> 20:34.560
JAMES: Good, OK, right...
-Oh, James, important thing.

20:34.560 --> 20:38.880
In Mongolia,
when you start on a journey,
you have to turn right.

20:38.920 --> 20:40.560
-What?
-Is that true?
-Yes, that is true.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.200
-Is that a thing?
-It is genuinely a thing.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.800
-What, every time?
-Every time
that you begin a journey

20:44.800 --> 20:46.800
-you go right.
-Right, here we go.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.440
This is it.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.320
-Right, James!
-Right, right, right!

20:52.320 --> 20:54.280
-Right.
-That's a rut
or something.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.800
James, you're going left.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.800
Hang on, the wheels are...

21:00.800 --> 21:02.680
-Hey?
-Just turn it... OK, go left.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.520
And now set off.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.720
The steering's back to front,
Hammond.
How have we done that?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.760
-What do you mean
it's back to front?
-Look, I'm turning left.

21:09.800 --> 21:12.000
No, you're not,
you're just going straight.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.960
-Turn it the other way, then.
-If I turn it the other way,
that's straight.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.200
And now I'm turning right
and it's going left.
So I need to keep...

21:18.240 --> 21:20.800
What have you two been
doing for the last two days?

21:20.800 --> 21:23.560
We put the hydraulic pipes on
the wrong way round
for the steering.

21:23.560 --> 21:24.560
Yes.

21:26.320 --> 21:30.040
JAMES: Having fixed this
minor issue, we set off.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.160
Again.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.320
Ha-ha! It works!
We're going along!

21:41.320 --> 21:43.280
Our car is great.

21:45.400 --> 21:46.800
The ride is good.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.760
-It's not bad, is it?
-It's genuinely brilliant.

21:51.400 --> 21:55.280
-Can we have a mild
brake test?
-Yeah, OK, here we go.

21:55.320 --> 21:58.360
-Whoa! Come on!
-Like it? They're
pretty good, actually.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.640
Well, whoever bled those,
well done. Good job.

22:01.680 --> 22:03.360
-That was you, wasn't it?
-No.

22:03.400 --> 22:06.400
But the doors I can claim.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.640
And the number plates.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.360
JEREMY: We had no idea
how far it was to Moron

22:15.400 --> 22:17.760
and no real idea
of how to get there.

22:18.840 --> 22:21.600
But Mr Wilman's stupid map

22:21.640 --> 22:24.120
said we should head
first of all

22:24.160 --> 22:25.840
to the Sandy Pit.

22:29.040 --> 22:32.360
-Right, you see between
those two...mountain valley?
-Yeah.

22:32.400 --> 22:33.840
Stick to the valley floor.

22:37.040 --> 22:39.560
JAMES: As we trundled along,
it soon became obvious

22:39.600 --> 22:42.560
that if Jeremy had been asked
questions about Mongolia

22:42.600 --> 22:45.240
on Who Wants To Be
A Millionaire?

22:45.280 --> 22:47.040
he might have got
some of them right.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.800
RICHARD: Sheeps.
JAMES: Sheepses.

22:48.840 --> 22:52.280
Oh, do you know how they
kill sheep in Mongolia?

22:52.320 --> 22:53.600
-No.
-Would you like to know?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.360
-Your door's come open.
-Yes.

22:55.400 --> 22:58.760
-So they make a snick
in its neck, yes...
-Yes.

22:58.800 --> 23:01.680
...put their hand
in through the snick,

23:01.720 --> 23:06.040
grab the aorta on the heart
and squeeze it
till the animal dies.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.560
Apparently it makes
the sheep feel quite sleepy.

23:08.600 --> 23:11.120
-Sleepy?
-I'm not sure,

23:11.160 --> 23:14.960
if somebody made a hole in
my neck and put their hand
in and squeezed my heart

23:15.000 --> 23:17.480
-I'd say I'm feeling sleepy.
-No.

23:23.080 --> 23:24.720
Wow, look! Cows.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.960
Or yakky things.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.600
Did you know, Hammond,
that you can make vodka
from the milk of a yak?

23:31.640 --> 23:33.080
How do I milk a yak?

23:33.120 --> 23:35.040
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

23:38.640 --> 23:42.200
JEREMY: Eventually,
we started to climb
off the valley floor.

23:45.240 --> 23:47.480
How fast do you
suppose we're going?

23:47.520 --> 23:49.880
-No idea.
JAMES: 20mph?

23:49.920 --> 23:52.200
This old engine
was the one where it would
get bogged down off-road

23:52.240 --> 23:53.960
because of the turbo,
wasn't it?

23:54.000 --> 23:55.120
This is the one that
people complained about

23:55.160 --> 23:57.040
when they put it in
the Defender.

23:57.080 --> 23:59.600
So we're not talking about
a blitz of power, then,
from it?

23:59.640 --> 24:02.680
No, but they're bloody
long-lived... They're
really tough engines.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.600
JEREMY: Oh, oh, oh!
RICHARD: Wait a minute.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.440
-Wow!
-Oh, my God!

24:11.440 --> 24:13.360
JAMES: Oh, look at that!

24:14.800 --> 24:16.480
That's the sandy bit.

24:16.520 --> 24:20.160
That's massive.

24:20.200 --> 24:24.680
JEREMY: In fact, it was
just a small detached bit
of the Gobi Desert.

24:26.680 --> 24:29.400
But even so, it would
be the first real test

24:29.440 --> 24:33.080
for our hastily built
homemade car.

24:35.440 --> 24:37.720
Oh, right, there is a river.

24:37.760 --> 24:39.400
JAMES: I see it.

24:39.440 --> 24:41.760
RICHARD: I think we want to
get out where that horse is.

24:41.800 --> 24:43.960
-The horse is...
-Literally having a piss.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.320
JEREMY: That's milk, though,
coming out of it.
How's that happened?

24:46.360 --> 24:47.800
RICHARD: No, it's wee.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.040
JEREMY: Yeah, you're good.

24:50.080 --> 24:52.240
-Right, up you go.
-(REVVING)

24:52.280 --> 24:54.440
RICHARD: There it is.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.400
JEREMY: Having reached
the edge of the sand...

24:59.240 --> 25:02.000
...it was time
to prepare for entry.

25:02.040 --> 25:03.880
Right, hang on,
let me just get my compass.

25:03.920 --> 25:05.880
This is where we are
gonna need it.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.080
So I put the N on the N,
don't I?

25:09.120 --> 25:10.920
And then you're looking
for Northeast.

25:12.400 --> 25:15.480
-So that way.
-Yeah.

25:15.520 --> 25:18.160
JEREMY: The car had
a low-range gearbox.

25:18.200 --> 25:20.600
But as its engine
was a bit gutless,

25:20.640 --> 25:22.960
Hammond and I got out
to reduce weight

25:23.000 --> 25:26.880
and set off to climb
the first dune on foot.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.040
Oh, Hammond. Beer.

25:30.080 --> 25:32.000
Agh!

25:32.040 --> 25:34.600
But, boy,
was it worth the effort!

25:39.640 --> 25:42.160
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

25:42.200 --> 25:44.880
Oh, holy mother of...

25:44.920 --> 25:48.480
RICHARD: That's beautiful.
I didn't expect this.

25:48.520 --> 25:50.880
JEREMY: Well,
it's a lost world, look.

25:53.080 --> 25:54.600
As we admired the view,

25:54.640 --> 25:56.800
the world's
best off-road driver

25:56.840 --> 25:58.800
was beginning his ascent.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.680
Bollocks!

26:03.720 --> 26:06.800
Be a shame if he misses
this view because of
his incompetence.

26:06.840 --> 26:08.480
-Yeah.
-Because we've
already proved the car works.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's not the car.
He's just messing about.

26:16.120 --> 26:17.160
Ohh!

26:19.760 --> 26:23.120
JEREMY:
Hammond then went off to
find a route James could use,

26:23.160 --> 26:27.760
leaving me to contemplate the
majesty of my surroundings.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.920
They say this is
the dark heart of Asia.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.480
Perhaps that's
why no-one comes.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.440
But, I mean, look.

26:40.920 --> 26:43.080
And the other thing is,
Genghis Khan

26:43.120 --> 26:47.960
created in just 20 years
the biggest empire
the world has ever seen.

26:48.000 --> 26:50.160
Why? It's not like
he was cramped here.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.240
(SIGHS)

26:54.280 --> 26:56.560
I don't really
want to go to a town.

26:56.600 --> 26:59.320
-Oh, oh!
-(BLEEP) me!

26:59.360 --> 27:00.920
Said the cameraman.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.000
We really are good
at wildlife photography,
aren't we?

27:03.040 --> 27:06.880
-"Ooh, (BLEEP) me!"
-(LAUGHTER)

27:06.920 --> 27:08.840
JAMES: Right, here we come!

27:08.880 --> 27:13.400
JEREMY:
With Hammond's help, James
finally got up the dune.

27:13.440 --> 27:15.720
Yes, come on!
Come on, come on, come on.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.080
Keep going, keep moving.
Mind that dip.

27:18.120 --> 27:21.280
Oh, yes!

27:21.320 --> 27:25.320
But from then on the going
got tougher and tougher.

27:27.200 --> 27:29.120
(GROANS) Come on.

27:31.240 --> 27:33.200
-Yeah, OK.
-That's what I meant,
that's what I meant.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.320
Right, digging.

27:38.800 --> 27:39.840
Yes!

27:41.280 --> 27:42.760
Try it up that way.

27:44.360 --> 27:47.120
-James, back it up.
-Agh.

27:51.880 --> 27:53.800
(ENGINE STRAINS)

27:58.040 --> 27:59.600
Whoa, not again!

28:06.520 --> 28:08.840
-It's gonna go.
JEREMY: Yes!

28:08.880 --> 28:13.160
RICHARD: That worked!
-(LAUGHS)

28:13.200 --> 28:17.120
JEREMY: Eventually,
after a lot of digging
and zigging and zagging,

28:17.160 --> 28:20.520
we reached some firmer sand.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.640
Oh, we are
making progress now.

28:23.680 --> 28:25.240
-Oh, yes.
-Straight on a bit.

28:25.280 --> 28:27.280
-Greenery!
-Yes, there it is!

28:27.320 --> 28:29.200
RICHARD: Salvation!

28:30.280 --> 28:32.920
-Ohh!
-Bumpy.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.320
JEREMY:
Hold on, stop, stop, stop.

28:34.360 --> 28:36.400
Stop. I see a problem.

28:36.440 --> 28:38.280
(JAMES CHUCKLES)

28:38.320 --> 28:42.240
Right, so between us
and our quest is...

28:42.280 --> 28:43.720
-A big drop.
-A cliff.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.840
No, it's fine actually,
James.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.160
Is it?
Yeah, it's fine. It's...

28:50.200 --> 28:51.480
Yeah, you're good.
It's like that.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.480
-Good.
-It's pretty much level-ish.

28:54.520 --> 28:56.440
Yeah, you'll be fine.
Off you go.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.400
Oh, you're funny men!

29:00.440 --> 29:03.080
Oh, you're very funny!

29:03.120 --> 29:06.120
JEREMY: Having crossed
the sandy bit,

29:06.160 --> 29:09.080
we paused for
a moment of celebration.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.120
So, there we are.
The first successful crossing

29:15.160 --> 29:17.120
of the mighty Gobi Desert,

29:17.160 --> 29:19.680
or some of it, in that car.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.160
No, hang on a minute.

29:22.360 --> 29:24.000
What?

29:24.040 --> 29:26.920
What's troubling me
is you see that little
bit of river there?

29:26.960 --> 29:30.880
-Yes.
-That's the river we crossed
to get into the Gobi Desert.

29:30.920 --> 29:34.440
And we've emerged
300 metres away

29:34.480 --> 29:37.640
from the stream
where we went
into the desert.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.080
James,
I've got some bad news.

29:40.120 --> 29:42.440
We are still south
of the Gobi Desert.

29:45.760 --> 29:46.800
Oh...

29:49.400 --> 29:52.080
JEREMY: Rather than try
to drive through it again,

29:52.120 --> 29:56.760
we decided to bravely
drive round it instead.

29:56.800 --> 30:01.400
Right, now, let's just
gloss over the fact that we
made a catastrophic error,

30:01.440 --> 30:04.480
and ended up
back where we started from...

30:04.520 --> 30:06.480
Just go round to...
We're going round the east,
Hammond.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.520
Yes.

30:11.240 --> 30:14.480
JEREMY:
Do you think this passes
for a road in Mongolia?

30:14.520 --> 30:16.000
I suspect this is a road,
yes.

30:16.040 --> 30:17.320
I should think... Yeah.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.080
Cos do you know
how many paved roads

30:19.120 --> 30:20.280
there are in
the whole country?

30:20.320 --> 30:22.960
-Go on.
-Two.

30:23.000 --> 30:25.760
-There's not two paved roads.
-Outside of the cities,

30:25.800 --> 30:27.720
there are only
two paved roads.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.640
Whoa, bumpy.

30:30.680 --> 30:32.560
(ALL GROANING)

30:32.600 --> 30:34.480
-James!
-Bumps!

30:35.680 --> 30:36.800
(ALL GROANING)

30:36.840 --> 30:39.120
One of the things
I'm worried about is

30:39.160 --> 30:41.040
haemorrhoids
from these seats.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.760
It's a very real possibility.

30:42.800 --> 30:44.560
You can get haemorrhoids
from hard seats?

30:44.600 --> 30:46.400
Yeah. Bounc... Jiggling.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.760
However, there is
a Mongolian cure for them.

30:48.800 --> 30:50.600
(GROANING)

30:50.640 --> 30:52.640
Kill a wolf,

30:52.680 --> 30:54.480
remove its anus

30:54.520 --> 30:56.560
and then grate it
onto your food.

30:58.200 --> 30:59.280
I don't fanc--

30:59.320 --> 31:00.920
-Really?
-No, seriously.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.840
Because they reckon that
wolves never get piles.

31:03.880 --> 31:05.400
So they reckon--

31:05.440 --> 31:08.120
What, on the basis that
no wolf has ever said,
"Ooh, my piles"?

31:08.160 --> 31:10.080
"Ooh, my Chalfonts."

31:12.040 --> 31:14.440
RICHARD: Bump! Ooh.

31:14.480 --> 31:16.440
JAMES: As Jeremy
continued to amaze us

31:16.480 --> 31:19.400
with his interesting facts
about Mongolia...

31:19.440 --> 31:23.240
I do know that one of
Genghis Khan's cavalrymen

31:23.280 --> 31:25.800
could shoot an arrow
through a marmot's head

31:25.840 --> 31:29.880
from 250 feet away
while galloping.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.360
...it started to go dark.

31:32.400 --> 31:36.840
But because
we'd covered so few miles,
we had to plough on.

31:36.880 --> 31:39.600
What the temperature is doing
is plummeting.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.280
Where's the heater?

31:41.320 --> 31:43.520
-Ah. There isn't one.
-Yes.

31:43.560 --> 31:46.760
-Look, come on.
-You can thank
Mr Wilman for that one.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.680
RICHARD: Bump!

31:48.720 --> 31:50.160
-(RATTLING)
-Oh-ha!

31:50.200 --> 31:53.480
JEREMY: Soon we couldn't
see where we were going.

31:53.520 --> 31:56.960
-Ready for some lights?
-Yeah, does this thing...
Might be that.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.040
-Lights! There they are!
-(CHEERING)

32:00.080 --> 32:02.320
JEREMY: Hello. We've died.
JAMES: We have died.

32:02.360 --> 32:04.160
RICHARD: Problem.
-Don't panic.

32:04.200 --> 32:06.720
Don't panic. Handbrake,
please, Mr Hammond.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.640
No, we've completely
lost the electrics.

32:08.680 --> 32:10.320
So we turned the lights on
and...

32:10.360 --> 32:13.080
That's what's...
It's fried a fuse, maybe.

32:13.120 --> 32:15.160
JEREMY: The main fuse
had indeed blown.

32:15.200 --> 32:16.440
So we replaced it

32:16.480 --> 32:19.120
and with the roof lights
turned off,

32:19.160 --> 32:23.880
resumed our headlong plunge
into the cold unknown.

32:26.280 --> 32:28.200
(WIND WHISTLING)

32:37.360 --> 32:39.280
JAMES: Let's sing a song!
-No.

32:40.960 --> 32:42.760
JEREMY: Desperate
to cover more ground,

32:42.800 --> 32:45.760
we didn't pitch the tents
till 1am.

32:49.760 --> 32:54.240
And then
after another cold night
of frost-hardened misery,

32:54.280 --> 32:57.720
we wondered how we could make
our car more comfortable.

32:57.760 --> 33:00.040
-Are you stiff?
-Oh, God, yeah.

33:00.080 --> 33:03.760
My neck and back,
like, legs, everything.

33:03.800 --> 33:07.320
Yeah, well, we're gonna...
I think we're gonnna make
extra lumber support

33:07.360 --> 33:10.000
with our rolled up
air mattress things.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.560
And I would suggest from
my experiences yesterday

33:11.600 --> 33:13.320
we use a bit of
the spare leftover foam

33:13.360 --> 33:16.080
and double the thickness
of the arse portion.

33:16.120 --> 33:18.800
I tell you what
I thought of in the night.

33:18.840 --> 33:22.080
-Yes?
-We should give
our vehicle a name.

33:22.120 --> 33:26.120
I thought about that. I came
up with Genghis Car.

33:26.160 --> 33:27.640
-(LAUGHING)
-That's really good!

33:27.680 --> 33:30.480
-It's not bad, is it?
-The only slight problem
with it is

33:30.520 --> 33:33.320
Genghis was
quite a big murderer.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.000
-He was quite murdery.
-I suppose he was murdery.

33:35.040 --> 33:36.720
He did 34 million.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.400
Let's not name it
after him, then.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.680
There's another
problem as well.

33:40.720 --> 33:43.240
-He was quite rapey.
-He was very rapey.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.160
-The rapiest man
ever to have lived.
-Yeah, he was.

33:45.200 --> 33:47.360
Do you know,
and this is not made up,

33:47.400 --> 33:51.560
one in every 200 people
alive today

33:51.600 --> 33:55.160
can trace their ancestry
back to Genghis Khan

33:55.200 --> 33:56.880
or the seed of Genghis Khan.

33:56.920 --> 33:59.280
So how did he have time
to do any warring?

33:59.320 --> 34:04.840
Well, he must have just been
a skin full of sperm.

34:04.880 --> 34:07.760
JEREMY: As work on
the modifications progressed,

34:07.800 --> 34:10.040
I came up with a name
we liked.

34:10.080 --> 34:14.080
-John.
-John's a good solid name.
I like it.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.640
It's honest.
It's unpretentious.

34:15.640 --> 34:17.880
-Dependable people
are called John.
-Yes.

34:17.920 --> 34:21.120
-John Lewis.
-That is a dependable shop.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.160
-Isn't it?
-Yeah, exactly,
because it's called John.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.160
With the comfort mods
complete

34:26.160 --> 34:28.200
and John duly christened...

34:30.200 --> 34:33.160
...we set off in search of
our next waypoint:

34:34.760 --> 34:36.640
the Watery Part.

34:38.200 --> 34:40.880
However,
Hammond was not happy.

34:42.680 --> 34:45.520
Why are you driving?

34:45.560 --> 34:46.880
Well, you drove yesterday.

34:46.920 --> 34:48.760
No, I didn't.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.800
-You did drive yesterday.
-I didn't.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.320
He can't remember anything,
can he?

34:53.360 --> 34:55.000
His memory...
Your memory, Hammond,

34:55.040 --> 34:56.680
is just getting appalling.

34:56.760 --> 34:59.520
I didn't drive.
I still haven't driven it.

35:00.760 --> 35:02.520
To try and distract Hammond,

35:02.560 --> 35:06.280
I came up with some more of
my special Mongol trivia.

35:06.320 --> 35:08.640
Back in the 13th Century,

35:08.640 --> 35:10.640
Khan, Genghis,

35:10.680 --> 35:12.520
could get messages, OK,

35:12.560 --> 35:16.560
from one side of his empire
to the other in four days.

35:16.600 --> 35:20.440
They could do 250 miles
a day. One rider.

35:20.480 --> 35:22.000
-What, relay horses?
-One rider. Yeah.

35:22.040 --> 35:25.320
You'd ride, galloping,
flat out, 25 miles.

35:25.360 --> 35:26.560
When you were a mile out

35:26.600 --> 35:28.200
from the horse station
you were approaching,

35:28.280 --> 35:29.880
you sounded your horn.

35:29.920 --> 35:31.320
They had a horse ready.

35:31.360 --> 35:32.880
You leapt onto it
without getting...

35:32.920 --> 35:34.600
just from one horse
to the other,

35:34.640 --> 35:36.040
and then carried on

35:36.080 --> 35:39.160
and he could do
250 miles a day.

35:39.160 --> 35:42.800
-So how many horses
did he have?
-Across the empire?

35:42.840 --> 35:44.760
-Yeah.
-30 million.

35:47.080 --> 35:50.640
JEREMY:
To keep Hammond's tiny mind
from thinking about driving,

35:50.640 --> 35:53.000
we put him in charge
of navigation.

35:53.040 --> 35:55.800
And weirdly,
he was rather good at it.

35:57.560 --> 36:00.800
So we've got these two
mountain ranges...

36:00.840 --> 36:03.840
and we go left and the watery
bit will be over there.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.440
And guess what?
He was right.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.960
It turned out to be a river,
which we'd have to cross.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.840
Er...can't really
get out there.

36:16.880 --> 36:18.920
Over there we can get out.

36:18.960 --> 36:22.000
Oh, yes.
Picking my route carefully.

36:22.040 --> 36:25.800
You don't need low-range.
You just need somebody
with skill and precision.

36:25.840 --> 36:26.880
Whoa!

36:29.920 --> 36:31.560
RICHARD: Agh!

36:31.600 --> 36:33.800
-That went wrong!
-Jeez!

36:33.840 --> 36:35.880
Why would you do that to us?

36:35.920 --> 36:41.560
Oh, the rest of the day's
gonna be bloody miserable!
You muppet!

36:41.600 --> 36:44.040
JEREMY: To make sure
it wasn't, we built a fire,

36:45.160 --> 36:48.160
dried our shirts,

36:48.200 --> 36:52.160
and then set off once more
into the big nothing.

37:15.960 --> 37:20.840
And after a while, I felt
another Mongolia fact
coming on.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.800
It's about the same size as
Spain, France, Germany, the
Czech Republic, Italy--

37:24.840 --> 37:27.480
-All rolled in?
-...Britain, Ireland,
all rolled in.

37:27.520 --> 37:29.520
RICHARD: And it's empty.

37:29.560 --> 37:33.640
Three million people living
in an area the size of
Western Europe.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.600
-Yeah. Staggering.
-Yeah.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.600
With the sun
gently warming us,

37:39.640 --> 37:44.040
we continued onwards in
search of the Twin Lakes.

37:47.440 --> 37:51.360
Until navigator Hammond
suggested we climb
a small hill

37:51.400 --> 37:53.320
to get our bearings.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.640
That looks a lot steeper
from here

37:58.640 --> 38:00.760
than it did from back there.

38:00.800 --> 38:02.520
It's a little hill.

38:03.640 --> 38:05.560
JEREMY: Soon, though...

38:08.280 --> 38:10.160
Axle tramping.

38:10.160 --> 38:13.080
-Quite a lot of
axle tramping.
-Quite bad.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.320
-Right, stop.
-Yeah.

38:15.360 --> 38:17.640
-I have.
-Right, I think
we should get out.

38:17.640 --> 38:20.400
-Why should you get out?
-I'm the only one
who's driven John up hills

38:20.440 --> 38:22.080
and I'm telling you,
that's too steep.

38:23.160 --> 38:24.360
OK.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.200
-You got it. You got it.
-That's better.

38:30.280 --> 38:32.080
-Yeah!
-Come on, John.

38:32.120 --> 38:33.440
-Wow!
-Come on!

38:33.480 --> 38:36.880
JEREMY: He's hopping up
this hill like a rabbit.

38:36.920 --> 38:39.160
RICHARD:
That is a remarkable sight.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.160
JEREMY:
What a machine you are, John!

38:48.320 --> 38:50.440
Good.

38:50.480 --> 38:52.400
(LAUGHS)

38:54.920 --> 38:57.280
RICHARD: Yeah!
JAMES: That's amazing.

38:57.320 --> 39:01.080
John, the mountaineer
of many places,

39:01.120 --> 39:03.880
has shaken his own
brake pedal off

39:03.920 --> 39:05.480
but has made it.

39:05.520 --> 39:10.320
JAMES: That's the first car
ever to pogo up a hill!

39:10.360 --> 39:13.040
JEREMY: Thanks to John's
incredible achievement,

39:13.080 --> 39:16.440
we could now see
what was what.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.800
Nice one, Hammond.

39:18.840 --> 39:21.600
-No lakes.
-Well, we can now
rule it out.

39:21.640 --> 39:23.960
We know it's not there.
It must be somewhere else.

39:25.400 --> 39:26.840
-Yeah, it is.
-Exactly.

39:26.880 --> 39:28.960
No, no, I mean, it is.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.640
Exactly. It's there.

39:31.640 --> 39:35.280
And so now we know where
we are in relation to it.

39:37.520 --> 39:38.920
JEREMY:
With the Twin Lakes found,

39:38.960 --> 39:43.080
we could plot the next leg
of our journey.

39:43.120 --> 39:44.840
Some Trees
are northeast, look.

39:44.880 --> 39:47.120
And there's
a Bumpy Meadow beyond.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.760
It's definitely northeast.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.840
After a pleasant drive
round the lakes

39:52.880 --> 39:54.840
and past Some Trees,

39:54.880 --> 39:58.560
we eventually arrived
at the Bumpy Meadow.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.440
Which didn't sound too bad.

40:00.480 --> 40:03.080
-However...
-Ow!

40:03.120 --> 40:05.040
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

40:07.080 --> 40:09.160
-Ah!
-Bloody hell!

40:09.160 --> 40:11.360
-Oh!
-That's proper bumpy.

40:11.400 --> 40:13.400
Ow!

40:13.440 --> 40:15.360
(ALL THREE GROANING)

40:15.400 --> 40:16.960
(BLEEP) hell!

40:17.000 --> 40:18.480
I can't tell from the map
how long this goes on for

40:18.520 --> 40:20.480
but it looks to be forever.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.440
(KNOCKING AND RATTLING)

40:25.040 --> 40:27.840
(GROANING)

40:27.880 --> 40:30.200
Smooth bit. Smooth.

40:30.280 --> 40:33.320
Gentlemen, enjoy this moment.

40:33.360 --> 40:34.960
I'm afraid it's over.

40:36.040 --> 40:37.680
-Ohh!
-Ugh!

40:37.760 --> 40:40.520
-Agh!
-Oh!

40:40.560 --> 40:42.200
-Agh!
-Oh, that was huge.

40:42.280 --> 40:43.760
Ow!

40:47.640 --> 40:50.040
(JAMES GROANS)

40:50.080 --> 40:51.920
RICHARD: Bloody hell!

40:51.960 --> 40:54.680
-(THUD)
-Oh! Ooh!

40:56.480 --> 40:58.960
That is 35 minutes
of solid this.

40:59.000 --> 41:02.000
-Yeah. Ugh!
-Let it end!

41:02.040 --> 41:04.360
(GROANING)

41:04.400 --> 41:05.920
There's the end, look, there.

41:05.960 --> 41:07.880
I know,
but it's 300 yards away.

41:07.920 --> 41:10.160
(GROANING)

41:10.160 --> 41:12.320
-Ooh!
-Ooh!

41:12.360 --> 41:14.440
I just dislocated
my pelvis if that's possible.

41:16.000 --> 41:17.920
It's just
snapped back into place.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.480
RICHARD: Oh, God.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.440
(RICHARD AND JAMES
SIGH WITH RELIEF)

41:30.440 --> 41:33.960
This is 500 miles.
Let's say we've done...
even if we've done 100...

41:34.000 --> 41:35.160
Yeah.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.760
Which is probably
about right.

41:36.800 --> 41:38.680
Don't think about it.

41:42.080 --> 41:45.160
Oh, 400 more miles of
not sleeping, not drinking

41:45.200 --> 41:48.080
and driving over
that sort of stuff.

41:48.120 --> 41:50.360
God, bloody hell!

41:50.400 --> 41:53.080
I wouldn't even call that a
meadow. It's not a meadow.

41:53.120 --> 41:56.640
I bet it was invented
by Genghis Khan
for people he hated.

41:56.640 --> 41:59.480
"You can either
have my solider

41:59.520 --> 42:02.560
put his hand up your anus
and pull your heart out of it

42:02.600 --> 42:04.560
or you can
drive across there."

42:04.600 --> 42:07.160
-Bring on the solider.
-Yeah. It is
bring on the solider.

42:10.400 --> 42:15.160
JEREMY: As evening fell,
we exchanged one sort of
discomfort for another.

42:16.640 --> 42:18.560
Um...I'm frozen.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.560
-What?
-I'm really cold.

42:20.600 --> 42:22.400
And the wind's
coming this way.

42:22.440 --> 42:25.040
I drive a lot faster
than you did yesterday.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.440
I didn't drive yesterday!

42:27.480 --> 42:29.360
What is the matter with him?

42:31.280 --> 42:33.520
JEREMY: God knows
how many miles later,

42:33.560 --> 42:36.160
we came across
our next landmark.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.400
Oh, and there it is.
That is the Creepy Teepee.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.280
What is it?

42:50.320 --> 42:52.640
(LAUGHS)
It must be for something.

42:52.680 --> 42:55.560
JAMES: Well, it must mean
something, mustn't it?

42:55.600 --> 42:58.320
JEREMY: The annoying
thing is, normally we'd
look it up on Google

42:58.360 --> 43:01.040
and then we'd say,
with learned faces,

43:01.080 --> 43:04.160
we know what this is
and we'd tell the viewer.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.360
Well, what we've
actually got to say now is,

43:06.400 --> 43:09.080
"We haven't got
any phone service.
You have. You look it up.

43:09.120 --> 43:10.520
Teepee, Mongolia."

43:10.560 --> 43:13.000
If you wouldn't mind
looking it up, what it is,

43:13.040 --> 43:15.360
and then imagine
we're imparting
that information to you

43:15.400 --> 43:17.280
-in a very learned fashion.
-I'll do it.

43:17.320 --> 43:19.920
(MOUTHS)

43:19.960 --> 43:21.200
James, that's fascinating.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.960
Thank you for telling me
all about this thing.

43:24.000 --> 43:25.840
-Ooh.
-What?

43:25.880 --> 43:27.320
Look at this.

43:27.360 --> 43:29.040
That looks like
bone and string.

43:29.080 --> 43:31.320
-That's a proper piece
of kit.
-I know.

43:31.360 --> 43:33.600
RICHARD:
That's a Mongolian bow.

43:33.640 --> 43:35.280
Ooh.

43:35.320 --> 43:38.560
-Is it finders, keepers,
or can I have it?
-It's finders, keepers.

43:38.600 --> 43:39.920
I'm just checking.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.880
Look, we don't know
what this is, do we?

43:41.920 --> 43:45.040
No. Are we
going to camp here?
Because it's still light.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.480
Should we press on
a bit further?

43:46.520 --> 43:48.560
We can go a bit more.
It's only half seven.

43:48.600 --> 43:50.360
If we camp here,
what are we gonna do?

43:50.400 --> 43:53.880
We'll have the tent up by
eight, fire lit by ten past.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.720
-What do we then think
at ten past eight?
-Well, what we'd normally do

43:56.760 --> 43:59.440
-is drink heavily
and set fire to that.
-Yeah. (LAUGHS)

43:59.480 --> 44:00.800
-But that can't happen.
-No, I know.

44:00.840 --> 44:03.080
But I'm not gonna
be able to resist...

44:03.120 --> 44:05.760
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)
-So I'm just not... Let's
go far away from here.

44:05.800 --> 44:08.240
Let's move on
from the Creepy Teepee.

44:12.800 --> 44:16.440
JEREMY: And so, on a glorious
evening, we did that.

44:16.480 --> 44:20.120
Until eventually...

44:20.160 --> 44:24.160
-Jeremy, you've been driving
for 12 hours straight.
-Yeah.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.760
-You've done really well and
you must be exhausted.
-Here we go.

44:26.800 --> 44:29.520
-Well, no, I tell you what,
why don't I...
-Yes, yeah, go on.

44:29.560 --> 44:31.040
-Really?
-Yes.

44:31.080 --> 44:33.800
I can't sit listening to this
twittering on any more.

44:33.840 --> 44:35.920
-Quickly.
-Really?
I'll gladly... Brilliant.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.480
-Thank you.
-Really?

44:37.520 --> 44:40.280
Well, he just won't shut up.
"Can I drive? Can I drive?"

44:40.320 --> 44:43.400
-Well, I mean,
it's fair enough.
-"Can I drive? Can I drive?

44:43.440 --> 44:46.560
-I built it.
I want to drive."
-Thank you very much.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.840
-First is over towards James.
-Oh-ho!

44:48.880 --> 44:51.120
-Oh, yeah.
-Stop, stop, stop, stop.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.200
What? What?

44:53.240 --> 44:54.480
Well, I'm just thinking,
hang on...

44:54.520 --> 44:58.200
This is literally
the most perfect spot.

45:00.040 --> 45:02.160
-He's right, actually.
-Why don't we
pitch camp here?

45:02.200 --> 45:03.560
-What?
-That is a top camping site.

45:03.600 --> 45:05.760
-Look at the view.
-I mean,
look at the view there.

45:05.800 --> 45:08.480
No, seriously, that is a...
Even you've got to admit
that's a perfect camp site.

45:08.520 --> 45:10.600
Yeah, shut it down, Hammond.
We'll pitch camp here.

45:12.240 --> 45:13.560
(ENGINE STOPS)

45:15.960 --> 45:18.760
JAMES: With that decided,
Hammond and I
got the fire going

45:18.800 --> 45:23.320
and then waited for
the food and beverage manager
to work his magic.

45:23.360 --> 45:25.440
-I didn't stop you driving.
-You did.

45:25.480 --> 45:28.040
-How?
-Suddenly deciding
to camp here.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.160
Well, come on, you must admit
this is the perfect...

45:30.200 --> 45:33.040
Even you can't find anything
to criticise about this

45:33.080 --> 45:34.680
and you're
a camping enthusiast.

45:34.720 --> 45:36.080
-It's very nice, yeah.
-It's perfect.

45:36.120 --> 45:37.400
But there's plenty of nice--

45:37.440 --> 45:39.960
-Guys?
-What?

45:40.000 --> 45:43.720
Have you seen
the ration boxes
for tonight and tomorrow?

45:43.760 --> 45:45.400
No, that's your department.

45:45.440 --> 45:48.200
I know, but I put them
in that box this morning
and they've gone.

45:48.240 --> 45:50.520
All we've got is night six.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.840
We've got night six

45:53.880 --> 45:56.600
and we've got bread-making
kit, which is flour and rice.

45:56.640 --> 45:59.440
Oh, no, hang on a minute.
Where were the ration boxes?

45:59.480 --> 46:01.160
Well, I thought they were
in that back box.

46:01.200 --> 46:02.920
That's where I've been
keeping them the whole time.

46:02.960 --> 46:04.760
-You know,
the one on the right.
-Yes.

46:04.800 --> 46:07.240
The lid of that was
bouncing up and down when
you did the Pac-Man thing.

46:07.280 --> 46:09.200
I bet they fell out.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.360
Well, that's actually
really bad.

46:12.400 --> 46:14.280
Well, we've got ration six,

46:14.320 --> 46:16.240
which is for the night
after tomorrow,

46:16.280 --> 46:19.400
which gives us
tomato and pasta salad,

46:19.440 --> 46:23.200
Thai-style chicken soup,
tomato and pasta salad.

46:23.240 --> 46:25.080
Oh, no. I do apologise.

46:25.120 --> 46:26.960
No, it's all right. Relax.

46:27.000 --> 46:30.280
We've got two sachets
of instant coffee

46:30.320 --> 46:33.040
and one sachet of creamer.

46:33.080 --> 46:34.920
Well, you can't... No,
I'm sorry, I don't buy that.

46:34.960 --> 46:36.880
I have done
high and low searching.

46:36.920 --> 46:40.120
-Were they boxes like that?
-Yeah, they're boxes
exactly like that.

46:40.160 --> 46:41.880
Did you strap them
to the back, on there?

46:41.920 --> 46:43.960
Because I've taken
that sand ladder off today.

46:44.000 --> 46:47.240
Were any of them
on top of here because
all of this has come off?

46:47.280 --> 46:48.880
-All of that.
-I didn't put it in there.

46:48.920 --> 46:51.040
Bloody hell. Are you sur...

46:51.080 --> 46:52.800
I'm 100% sure.

46:52.840 --> 46:54.640
Honestly,
I've looked everywhere.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.080
Well, if we were sensible,

46:58.120 --> 46:59.880
we'd have
how many nights is it?

46:59.920 --> 47:02.000
He reckons
we need three more nights.

47:02.040 --> 47:04.000
And there's three sachets.

47:04.040 --> 47:07.160
-So we'd be down to
a third of a sachet each.
-Yeah.

47:07.200 --> 47:10.040
And each sachet contains,
what is it, 6,000 calories
or something?

47:10.080 --> 47:13.000
Well, there's a lot of
food value in them
cos they're for soldiers.

47:13.040 --> 47:14.400
So what if we share one?

47:14.440 --> 47:16.160
I... Something'll turn up.

47:16.200 --> 47:19.000
Let's just pretend
this hasn't happened
and eat the lot.

47:19.040 --> 47:20.760
It's always my philosophy.

47:29.640 --> 47:33.800
JEREMY: The next morning,
after another sober
and sleepless night,

47:33.840 --> 47:36.280
it became obvious
that the lack of drink

47:36.320 --> 47:39.840
was having a strange effect
on one of my colleagues.

47:43.680 --> 47:45.160
What are you doing?

47:45.200 --> 47:47.880
I've had an idea.
It's raining, yeah?

47:47.920 --> 47:50.200
We need windscreen wipers.
We don't have one on there.

47:50.240 --> 47:53.080
So I thought of
how to build one.
Got all this rubber.

47:53.120 --> 47:54.800
Sandwich that.
Two pieces of wood.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.680
Big piece of wood
over the back of it.

47:56.720 --> 47:59.480
Bit of string round it.
We can operate it as
a windscreen wiper.

48:00.800 --> 48:02.440
What's all that racket?

48:02.480 --> 48:04.760
Well, somebody's
kidnapped Richard Hammond

48:04.800 --> 48:07.360
and replaced him with this
Richard Hammond lookalike,

48:07.400 --> 48:10.040
who got up early,
had an idea by himself,

48:10.080 --> 48:14.480
is executing it by himself
and it's a windscreen wiper.

48:14.520 --> 48:17.680
And you borrowed my book
last night on the history
of Mongolia.

48:17.720 --> 48:21.320
It's very, very good as well.
I've just got to the visit
from those monks

48:21.360 --> 48:23.920
when they're first over there
and first encounter
Mongolian culture,

48:23.960 --> 48:26.320
which until then simply
hadn't been known about.

48:26.360 --> 48:29.600
Anyway, I've got to
get on with this.
I've nearly done it.

48:29.640 --> 48:31.760
The only slight problem
I can see

48:31.800 --> 48:34.400
-with the new dynamic
Richard Hammond...
-Mm.

48:34.440 --> 48:37.280
...is that he might
get his memory back.

48:37.320 --> 48:40.440
-A sober Richard Hammond.
-I see what you mean, yeah.

48:40.480 --> 48:43.200
Um...let's get this straight.
When did he drive?

48:43.240 --> 48:44.880
-The day before yesterday.
-The day before yesterday.

48:44.920 --> 48:48.200
-And he drove last night.
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, OK, yeah.

48:48.240 --> 48:51.880
-So it's my turn, isn't it?
-It's your turn, yeah.

48:51.920 --> 48:54.480
-Did he... Has he really made
a windscreen wiper?
-Yeah.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.240
And it sounds
like it'll work.

48:56.280 --> 48:58.840
-We'll bring him along again.
-(LAUGHS)

49:02.840 --> 49:04.520
JEREMY: We then set off.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.200
And exactly 17 seconds later,

49:07.240 --> 49:11.680
conversation reverted to
the principal issue at hand.

49:11.720 --> 49:16.400
Last night, I had a dream
about a glass of wine.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.760
You're dreaming
about wine now.

49:17.800 --> 49:20.240
And I can tell you
it was a Sancerre.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.360
It had that fantastic
acidic hit at the beginning

49:22.400 --> 49:27.120
and then a couple of seconds
later that slight warmth
in the roof of my mouth.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.840
It was fantastic.
And then I woke up
and it wasn't true.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.440
And I nearly wept.

49:31.480 --> 49:34.480
You know what we should
call this car, really,
instead of John?

49:34.520 --> 49:35.920
-What, Gin?
-Rehab!

49:35.960 --> 49:37.120
(ALL LAUGH)

49:38.280 --> 49:40.320
(RUMBLE OF THUNDER)

49:40.360 --> 49:42.800
JEREMY: Soon the rain
became torrential.

49:42.840 --> 49:43.680
(CRASH OF THUNDER)

49:43.720 --> 49:45.080
Which meant it was time

49:45.120 --> 49:48.320
to unleash Professor
Hammond's invention.

49:50.520 --> 49:52.440
-What the hell is that?
-That is a windscreen wiper.

49:52.480 --> 49:54.720
Now, to me.

49:54.760 --> 49:56.200
To you.

49:56.240 --> 49:59.120
To me... to you.

50:00.640 --> 50:02.120
To me.

50:02.160 --> 50:04.160
Hammond, we're gonna
have to face facts.

50:04.200 --> 50:06.000
-To me.
-It doesn't work.

50:06.040 --> 50:08.120
To you.

50:08.160 --> 50:09.560
To me.

50:09.600 --> 50:11.080
It doesn't work, does it?

50:13.280 --> 50:15.040
This is raining
quite heavily now.

50:15.080 --> 50:16.400
(CRASH OF THUNDER)

50:16.440 --> 50:19.920
What is all...
What's happening
above me here, look?

50:19.960 --> 50:21.240
Above you?

50:21.280 --> 50:25.040
(RICHARD AND JEREMY LAUGH)

50:25.080 --> 50:26.440
(ALL THREE LAUGH)

50:26.480 --> 50:28.840
-Oh, dear.
-James, I'm afraid,
ladies and gentlemen,

50:28.880 --> 50:31.160
has wet himself.

50:31.200 --> 50:32.520
(ALL THREE LAUGH)

50:32.560 --> 50:34.480
-We need to work on that.
-We do.

50:36.360 --> 50:38.560
-It can't rain all day,
can it?
-Yes.

50:38.600 --> 50:41.760
-Oh, it's...
-Rain before seven,
fine by 11.

50:41.800 --> 50:43.800
I don't think
that works in Mongolia.

50:43.840 --> 50:47.480
-That's only in Cotswolds.
-(THUNDER)

50:47.520 --> 50:48.960
JEREMY:
Oh, hello, what's this?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.800
Look at that ridge.

50:52.720 --> 50:55.680
Look at that funny ridge.

50:55.720 --> 51:00.400
JEREMY:
What we'd stumbled on here
was a huge geological scar...

51:03.800 --> 51:06.880
...that seemingly
ran on for ever.

51:10.840 --> 51:15.240
I read about this in a book,
actually, before
I came out here.

51:15.280 --> 51:17.840
There used to be a lake as
big as that one over there,

51:17.880 --> 51:20.320
the one we camped by
last night, here,

51:20.360 --> 51:23.000
and then in 1905
there was an earthquake,

51:23.040 --> 51:25.880
a truly cataclysmic
earthquake.

51:25.920 --> 51:28.520
The lake was consumed.
It simply disappeared

51:28.560 --> 51:34.640
and a crack 400 kilometres
long was formed in the earth.

51:34.680 --> 51:37.760
But luckily,
this enormous earthquake
happened in Mongolia.

51:37.800 --> 51:40.840
So the death toll...was 15.

51:42.840 --> 51:45.680
As I marvelled
at the power of the planet,

51:45.720 --> 51:49.920
the Professor
was busy mending
and extending our roof.

51:49.960 --> 51:52.240
Right, so if we put
these two bars across...

51:52.280 --> 51:54.200
If you pull that
over to your side...

51:57.240 --> 52:00.040
That's better.

52:00.080 --> 52:02.840
JEREMY: With that done,
we resumed our journey.

52:02.880 --> 52:04.800
And since the Very Big Crack

52:04.840 --> 52:08.280
was one of the features on
our Winnie-the-Pooh map,

52:08.320 --> 52:11.920
we knew that next up
was the wooden house.

52:15.160 --> 52:16.600
It doesn't say
what the house is.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.080
JAMES: Could it be a pub?
RICHARD: Well...

52:19.120 --> 52:21.360
JEREMY: Well, it could be.
-Exactly right.

52:21.400 --> 52:22.880
Or just an off-licence.

52:22.920 --> 52:24.760
If it is a pub, on that map

52:24.800 --> 52:27.000
it's about 100 miles high,
so we won't miss it.

52:27.040 --> 52:29.440
JEREMY: Oh, no, this pub is
bigger than the Gobi Desert.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.640
Yeah, we should spot it,
then.

52:31.680 --> 52:34.760
It should also have
plenty of stock,
which it's going to need.

52:37.760 --> 52:40.240
JEREMY: Since we couldn't
only talk about drink,

52:40.280 --> 52:43.160
we tried to come up with some
other topics of conversation.

52:45.040 --> 52:47.720
I did a turd yesterday, OK?

52:47.760 --> 52:49.160
I looked down at it

52:49.200 --> 52:52.160
and it was two storeys
with a little bit sticking up

52:52.200 --> 52:55.080
and, as I looked down,
this fly landed on it.

52:55.120 --> 52:59.120
You could see it.
It looked at me like,
"This is now my palace."

52:59.160 --> 53:03.480
Then later on that same fly
was in your tent.

53:03.520 --> 53:08.400
With that subject exhausted,
we fell back on
my new favourite topic.

53:08.440 --> 53:10.080
There's no getting away
from the fact, though,

53:10.120 --> 53:13.600
that Genghis Khan was
the greatest military mind

53:13.640 --> 53:15.720
-the world has ever seen.
-But an utter bastard.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.000
Oh, an utter bastard.

53:17.040 --> 53:19.920
I mean,
Genghis once did one town

53:19.960 --> 53:23.320
and then he cut
all the women and children
and cats' heads off

53:23.360 --> 53:25.000
and made a pyramid
out of them.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.720
-Cats is a nice touch.
-Yeah.

53:26.760 --> 53:29.240
He hadn't got enough.
He needed some filler
for his pyramid,

53:29.280 --> 53:31.440
so he cut
all the cats' heads off.

53:31.480 --> 53:33.480
See, that's a warning
to the next town, isn't it?

53:33.520 --> 53:35.560
The next town is
gonna say, "We give in."

53:35.600 --> 53:40.520
"Ah, Mr Khan, we've had
a look at your CV and,
yes, you can have the city."

53:40.560 --> 53:42.840
-"And everything in it."
-"Help yourself!"

53:42.880 --> 53:45.760
But there has never been
a greater military mind.

53:45.800 --> 53:47.800
I mean, the Roman Empire

53:47.840 --> 53:49.520
compared to the Mongol Empire

53:49.560 --> 53:52.440
was literally
a speck of dust.

53:52.480 --> 53:55.960
His went from the Yellow Sea
to the Danube.

53:56.000 --> 54:01.400
At this point, our
conversation was interrupted
by something hilarious.

54:01.440 --> 54:03.680
-Oh, my God!
-Oh, ho-ho!

54:03.720 --> 54:06.080
-Oh, dear.
-Can we just see that
on that camera?

54:06.120 --> 54:07.960
I don't know if we can
turn it round a bit.

54:08.000 --> 54:09.440
That's our camera
tracking car.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.520
-(LAUGHS) It's stuck.
-Stuck.

54:11.560 --> 54:14.160
-John isn't.
John is not stuck.
-Are we stuck? No.

54:14.200 --> 54:18.440
As we needed the camera crew
to make this miserable trip
worthwhile,

54:18.480 --> 54:21.040
we had to rescue them.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.760
Are you feeling a bit smug?

54:22.800 --> 54:25.080
-I am actually full of smug.
-Yeah.

54:25.120 --> 54:26.680
-OK, here we go.
JAMES: Ready to go?

54:26.720 --> 54:28.360
In three, two, one.

54:28.400 --> 54:30.240
Dump that clutch. Dump it.

54:33.160 --> 54:35.960
-And we're free!
-John has done it!

54:36.000 --> 54:37.840
John has succeeded!

54:37.880 --> 54:42.640
John has pulled
the mass-produced
Toyota Land Cruiser

54:42.680 --> 54:44.440
out of the mire!

54:44.480 --> 54:46.880
Here's the message
we're giving you all.

54:46.920 --> 54:48.520
Buy Mongolian.

54:53.360 --> 54:57.280
Riding on
a cushion of smugness,
we resumed our search

54:57.320 --> 54:59.560
for the wooden pub.

54:59.600 --> 55:03.000
But soon it became
a cushion of misery.

55:04.760 --> 55:06.680
(WIND WHISTLES)

55:08.640 --> 55:10.720
Oh, that is cold now.

55:10.760 --> 55:12.960
Brrr-brrr-brrr.

55:13.000 --> 55:17.480
(RICHARD GROANS)
How can the temperature
vary this much this quickly?

55:17.520 --> 55:18.920
It's incredible.

55:18.960 --> 55:21.640
(GROANS) It's because
it's land-locked, isn't it?

55:21.680 --> 55:25.200
-There's no sea
to moderate it.
-Exactly.

55:25.240 --> 55:29.560
Moments later, though,
our spirits were lifted.

55:29.600 --> 55:32.760
-What's that?
-Pub. That's the pub.

55:32.800 --> 55:36.280
This is the first time
in two-and-a-half days
that I have hope in my heart.

55:36.320 --> 55:38.200
-Well, what do you want?
-Scotch.

55:38.240 --> 55:41.040
-I'd have mulled wine.
-No, brandy. I think brandy.

55:41.080 --> 55:42.320
What about
some King's Ginger?

55:42.360 --> 55:45.640
Ooh, God! Yes.

55:45.680 --> 55:48.160
-There's the door. Right.
-The door. The door.

55:48.200 --> 55:50.960
Three pints of your finest,
please, landlord.

55:52.880 --> 55:54.320
Locked?

55:54.360 --> 55:56.080
Shut, maybe.

55:56.120 --> 55:59.480
-It's not open.
-Well, they might just
not be up.

55:59.520 --> 56:02.320
-Hello...in Mongolian.
-Hello.

56:02.360 --> 56:03.800
-Oh, wait.
-Hello.

56:03.840 --> 56:06.440
-Oh, no, hang on.
-It's empty.

56:06.480 --> 56:08.120
-It is, isn't it?
-It's disused.

56:10.280 --> 56:12.200
(WIND WHISTLING)

56:29.320 --> 56:32.120
-Hungry. Hungry now.
RICHARD: Yeah.

56:32.160 --> 56:34.080
-And damp.
-And damp. Very damp.

56:36.400 --> 56:39.640
You know on other TV shows
where you've got, like,
explorers and stuff?

56:39.680 --> 56:40.920
You mean Bear Grylls?

56:40.960 --> 56:42.360
Yeah, they don't moan,
do they?

56:42.400 --> 56:43.840
-No, they don't moan...
-He doesn't moan.

56:43.880 --> 56:45.400
-...because they
go back to a hotel.
-Yeah.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.360
"Oh, I'm being chased
by a bear,"

56:47.400 --> 56:51.520
which is a man in a (BLEEP)
bear costume,
and then he goes to a hotel.

56:51.560 --> 56:56.800
We, on the other hand,
are stupid enough to sit
in a homemade car

56:56.840 --> 57:00.800
when it's minus 40,
with no drink, no food,

57:00.840 --> 57:03.040
and no end in sight
to this journey.

57:05.400 --> 57:08.760
I'm actually getting fed up.

57:08.800 --> 57:11.080
JEREMY: Several
horrible hours later, though,

57:11.120 --> 57:13.880
our spirits were
lifted once more.

57:13.920 --> 57:15.520
Wait a second. Is that...

57:17.280 --> 57:19.080
That's a road.

57:19.120 --> 57:22.080
That's the first made road
we've seen.

57:22.120 --> 57:23.720
The only place it can go
is Moron.

57:23.760 --> 57:25.880
-It's the only place.
-There isn't any other.

57:25.920 --> 57:29.560
Why go to the trouble
of making a road unless
it goes to the only town?

57:29.600 --> 57:31.960
-It's a road!
-This goes to Moron!

57:32.000 --> 57:33.440
JEREMY: We're on a road!

57:33.480 --> 57:35.320
Oh, let's get some speed up.

57:35.360 --> 57:37.000
We'll be at the pub tonight!

57:37.040 --> 57:39.440
Pub tonight,
we'll be straight there.

57:39.480 --> 57:40.880
Oh, my God!

57:40.920 --> 57:43.360
I've never been so happy
in my entire life.

57:43.400 --> 57:45.280
-There's a bridge...
-Smell it.

57:45.320 --> 57:48.920
We haven't even got
to clamber down.
There's an actual bridge!

57:48.960 --> 57:52.360
JEREMY: The bridge,
as it turned out, was
the Wibbly Wobbly Bridge.

57:52.400 --> 57:55.560
But Wibbly Wobbly was
a bit of an understatement.

57:59.480 --> 58:04.160
This was no problem for John,
though, who simply
hopped through the river.

58:07.040 --> 58:08.880
It's a signature
characteristic.

58:08.920 --> 58:10.400
-And back onto the road.
-It works.

58:10.440 --> 58:12.160
-Here we go.
-Moron, here we come!

58:12.200 --> 58:13.360
-Bunny hopping.
-Yes!

58:13.400 --> 58:15.240
Yes! Yes!

58:15.280 --> 58:17.360
What?

58:17.400 --> 58:18.760
JAMES: Well, that was
a bit short-lived.

58:18.800 --> 58:20.720
Oh, why has it just ended?

58:22.200 --> 58:23.800
JEREMY:
The reason it had ended

58:23.840 --> 58:26.480
was because of the
next feature on our map...

58:28.400 --> 58:30.200
...which up close
appeared to be...

58:32.160 --> 58:35.040
...completely impassable.

58:35.080 --> 58:40.440
However, Eeyore likes
boggy and sad places, so...

58:40.480 --> 58:43.400
-James, don't just...
James, don't drive in...
-As the bloody crow flies!

58:43.440 --> 58:45.520
Well, pick a route!

58:45.560 --> 58:47.960
JAMES: It's the same as
the stuff we were doing
yesterday.

58:48.000 --> 58:50.200
-Slow down!
-Not so fast!

58:50.240 --> 58:52.320
-Slow down!
-Calm down.
It's fine.

58:52.360 --> 58:54.640
This is an off-roader.
It's perfectly capable
of this sort of thing.

58:54.680 --> 58:58.520
-Well, it's not, is it?
It's...
-Just stop, stop, stop.

58:58.560 --> 59:00.840
It is idiotic
to drive in here.

59:00.880 --> 59:03.680
It's poured with rain all
last night and all morning.

59:03.720 --> 59:05.800
It's gonna be
an absolute quagmire.

59:05.840 --> 59:07.480
We've got to get
to those mountains.

59:07.520 --> 59:09.000
-Well, look...
-Let's find a...

59:09.040 --> 59:10.960
We'll find a way round it.
We need higher ground.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.160
If we drive around...
Look, if we drive around it,

59:13.200 --> 59:15.560
that could be an extra
100 miles for all we know.

59:15.600 --> 59:18.120
The road leads here. This is
obviously the way you go.

59:18.160 --> 59:20.880
They wouldn't build a road
to something you couldn't
drive through.

59:20.920 --> 59:22.600
Where are you going now?

59:22.640 --> 59:24.320
-Well, I'm aiming
for the mountains.
-Water here.

59:24.360 --> 59:25.600
Oh, we've...

59:25.640 --> 59:27.560
JAMES:
That's some mud. Don't worry.

59:29.720 --> 59:31.560
Oh, James!

59:31.600 --> 59:33.080
Agh! Agh!

59:34.600 --> 59:36.200
JAMES:
No, that's not gonna work.

59:36.240 --> 59:39.520
I'm going to kill him.

59:39.560 --> 59:43.400
RICHARD: Oh, bloody hell!
You've buried it!

59:43.440 --> 59:46.480
JAMES:
With two fewer passengers,
and the diffs locked...

59:46.520 --> 59:49.320
JEREMY: Go on, James, go on.
Power, power, power!

59:51.400 --> 59:53.400
...John boinged free.
-Yay!

59:53.440 --> 59:54.640
RICHARD: Excellent effort.

59:54.680 --> 59:56.400
JEREMY: Right, you're out.

59:56.440 --> 59:59.480
Only another 300 miles
of this bog you've
driven into to go.

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:04.480
JEREMY: Thanks to
May's stubbornness,

1:00:04.520 --> 1:00:05.800
it looked like
we'd be spending

1:00:05.840 --> 1:00:08.280
the rest of the day on foot.

1:00:10.680 --> 1:00:12.320
RICHARD: It could be
like this all the way.

1:00:14.720 --> 1:00:15.880
Oh, shitty death,
that's a bit...

1:00:19.920 --> 1:00:22.200
The bank collapsed.

1:00:22.240 --> 1:00:26.280
JAMES: Luckily, the new
improved Richard Hammond
came up with a plan.

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:28.680
Right, this'll do.

1:00:28.720 --> 1:00:30.440
Oh, for (BEEP) sake.

1:00:30.480 --> 1:00:31.760
I can't get my shoe...

1:00:31.800 --> 1:00:34.720
Oh, May! I've lost my shoes!

1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:36.360
Ha!

1:00:36.400 --> 1:00:40.680
What do you want me to do
before I die of hypothermia?

1:00:40.720 --> 1:00:44.280
Because my shoes
are four feet
under the bog over there.

1:00:44.320 --> 1:00:47.640
I'm going to shackle
the high-lift jack
to the eye on there.

1:00:47.680 --> 1:00:50.000
I'm then going to shackle
this tow rope
to the high-lift jack.

1:00:50.040 --> 1:00:53.960
I'm going to set 10 or 12
ground pins into the
solid ground over there,

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:56.640
use the parachute harness
as an anchor,
shackle this to that,

1:00:56.680 --> 1:00:58.920
and use the jack
as a winch to wind it out.

1:00:58.960 --> 1:01:03.800
I live in Holland Park,
I don't read
off-roading magazines.

1:01:05.360 --> 1:01:08.120
JAMES: He's being very sort
of authoritative, for him.

1:01:08.160 --> 1:01:10.680
Well, he's sober,
and he's in his element.

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:14.040
Right.

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:17.720
Give it a go.

1:01:19.600 --> 1:01:21.040
Come on, come on!

1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:24.360
Yay!

1:01:30.240 --> 1:01:34.000
Yeah, those mountains are
only now 70 kilometres away!

1:01:35.080 --> 1:01:37.000
RICHARD: Oh, dear God!

1:01:46.600 --> 1:01:48.520
We could have found
a path round.

1:01:52.720 --> 1:01:55.320
-(SPLASH)
-(JAMES SPUTTERS)

1:01:57.760 --> 1:02:03.080
JEREMY: Several miles later,
James became
his stuckest yet.

1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:04.600
Oh, my God.

1:02:04.640 --> 1:02:06.720
-Ah-h-h...
-It'll be all right, go on.

1:02:06.760 --> 1:02:09.000
-Agh, agh, agh!
-You're all right,
you'll be all right.

1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:10.840
That's very perilous.

1:02:10.880 --> 1:02:15.440
And then, alarmingly,
he asked Hammond
to take the wheel.

1:02:15.480 --> 1:02:18.760
You're going... Wait a
minute, you're actually
letting him drive John?

1:02:18.800 --> 1:02:20.440
Well, he's...
Well, he's from the country.

1:02:20.480 --> 1:02:21.720
You've to remember,
that's only like

1:02:21.760 --> 1:02:23.400
getting out of the
garage at Hammond's house.

1:02:23.440 --> 1:02:25.760
-(JEREMY CHUCKLES)
-(ENGINE REVS)

1:02:25.800 --> 1:02:28.440
You're in third gear.
Try first.

1:02:28.480 --> 1:02:31.440
Honestly, mate,
anyone would think you'd
never driven this before.

1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.720
RICHARD: Come on!
Come on, come... come out.

1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:40.520
-Ah!
-He's ruined everything
in there.

1:02:40.560 --> 1:02:41.880
The map, ruined.

1:02:41.920 --> 1:02:44.320
Compass, ruined.
Cameras are ruined.

1:02:44.360 --> 1:02:45.560
RICHARD:
It will go, it will...

1:02:45.600 --> 1:02:47.520
Oh, that's not supposed...
I can save this.

1:02:48.960 --> 1:02:51.280
And he's rolled it.
How far has he covered?

1:02:51.320 --> 1:02:53.320
Less than its own length.

1:02:53.360 --> 1:02:55.280
RICHARD: It's all right,
I'm used to this!

1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:57.240
(JEREMY LAUGHS)

1:02:57.280 --> 1:02:58.840
What are we going to do?

1:02:58.880 --> 1:03:03.560
I know, why don't you,
with your vast bulk,
just stand up on there?

1:03:03.600 --> 1:03:08.000
That could be enough to just
tip it back again. Jump off,
we're back where we started.

1:03:08.040 --> 1:03:09.280
What?

1:03:09.320 --> 1:03:11.520
-You want me to get on it?
-Well, just on there.

1:03:11.560 --> 1:03:13.000
-That's a brilliant idea.
-You're the heaviest.

1:03:13.040 --> 1:03:15.000
That's why they call
you Fatty Car Righter.

1:03:15.040 --> 1:03:17.400
(GRUNTS) Right, I'm on.

1:03:17.440 --> 1:03:20.040
(RICHARD LAUGHS)

1:03:20.080 --> 1:03:21.480
This was entirely
predictable...

1:03:21.520 --> 1:03:23.160
JAMES: There you go.
-It's working!

1:03:23.200 --> 1:03:25.920
-Yay!
-Thank you.

1:03:25.960 --> 1:03:28.080
-Right, the trouble is now,
James...
-Yeah?

1:03:28.120 --> 1:03:30.800
-...he's stuck where he is.
-And you're stuck
where you are.

1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:34.000
But if I climb over you
into that seat,
that should be enough.

1:03:34.040 --> 1:03:36.120
This is like the end
of The Italian Job.

1:03:36.160 --> 1:03:37.800
-Right, I'll stand
on the tyre.
-Yeah.

1:03:37.840 --> 1:03:40.080
Right, so Hammond gets out.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:43.080
-As I slide into the middle,
you get in at the same time.
-That's actually clever.

1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.200
And then he can get back in
and we're all in.

1:03:45.240 --> 1:03:47.600
-I'm out of there.
-And I'm going to get in now.

1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:50.600
-Right.
-Right, I'm firing up.

1:03:50.640 --> 1:03:52.560
(ENGINE REVS)

1:03:54.120 --> 1:03:55.160
Coming...

1:03:56.920 --> 1:03:59.120
-Agh!
-Jesus!

1:03:59.160 --> 1:04:01.600
-Christ on a...
-That was close.

1:04:01.640 --> 1:04:04.000
JEREMY: Right, we're out.
JAMES: There you go.

1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:05.480
Stop, I want to get out.

1:04:05.520 --> 1:04:08.080
I never want to drive
another inch with you,
or him.

1:04:10.920 --> 1:04:13.720
After such
a fraught afternoon,

1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:16.280
we all needed
a bit of me-time.

1:04:40.720 --> 1:04:43.320
After several silent hours,

1:04:43.360 --> 1:04:47.480
we stopped for the night
at what looked like
a promising spot.

1:04:52.080 --> 1:04:55.240
-But it just isn't, is it?
-Not really.

1:04:55.280 --> 1:04:57.280
(WIND WHISTLING)

1:04:57.320 --> 1:04:58.920
RICHARD: But no matter.

1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:01.680
The food and beverage manager
soon swung into action.

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.280
(HISS OF GAS)

1:05:04.320 --> 1:05:07.560
Using traditional methods
to get this fire going.

1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:09.600
And soon we shall have
some delicious rice.

1:05:09.640 --> 1:05:11.880
-How would you like it,
boiled?
-Yeah.

1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:15.120
-There's nothing
we can put with it.
-(BEEP) Ow! How's...

1:05:15.160 --> 1:05:17.360
What manner of thing
has happened?

1:05:17.400 --> 1:05:20.200
(BEEP) Shit! What's gone...

1:05:20.240 --> 1:05:22.040
RICHARD:
Incoming. (MIMICS EXPLOSION)

1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:25.440
Holy-moly!

1:05:25.480 --> 1:05:28.440
It was a hand grenade.
It was literally
a hand grenade.

1:05:28.480 --> 1:05:30.800
You set fire to the
plastic housing at the top.

1:05:33.880 --> 1:05:38.720
JEREMY: As supper cooked, I
decided to string my new bow.

1:05:38.760 --> 1:05:41.080
Where's my parachute cord?
Here.

1:05:41.120 --> 1:05:43.680
This bow, it goes that way,
doesn't it, yeah?

1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:45.120
No. Goes the other way.

1:05:45.160 --> 1:05:47.480
-Goes that way?
-Yeah.

1:05:47.520 --> 1:05:48.880
-That way?
-Yeah.

1:05:48.920 --> 1:05:51.760
-But surely you'd pull it...
-No, that will break it.

1:05:51.800 --> 1:05:55.640
Because the material
on the outside works better
when it's stretched.

1:05:55.680 --> 1:05:57.560
Its tendon, sinew.

1:05:57.600 --> 1:05:59.280
The material
on the inside, bone,

1:05:59.320 --> 1:06:01.040
works better
under compression
when it's squashed.

1:06:01.080 --> 1:06:04.320
It's the world's
first example of
composite materials.

1:06:04.360 --> 1:06:06.840
Some Mongolian warriors were
the first to ever do that.

1:06:06.880 --> 1:06:08.800
So they put the two materials
sandwiched together,

1:06:08.840 --> 1:06:11.120
so the bone is squashed
on the inside...

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:12.560
The tendon is stretched
on the outside,

1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:14.720
and then it goes "Pa-twang!"
And as a result,

1:06:14.760 --> 1:06:16.960
their bows could be half
the length of a long bow,

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:18.280
and still as powerful.

1:06:18.320 --> 1:06:20.600
So they could fire from
horseback over the neck,

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:23.240
and you fire to the right,
to the left, or behind.

1:06:23.280 --> 1:06:25.480
Those are the three positions
they could fire.

1:06:25.520 --> 1:06:28.320
I used to know this guy
called Richard Hammond
who was daft as a brush.

1:06:28.360 --> 1:06:31.280
How do you know all that
stuff about bows and arrows?

1:06:31.320 --> 1:06:32.600
It's just... I...

1:06:32.640 --> 1:06:35.040
Because I'm
remembering things.

1:06:35.080 --> 1:06:36.880
-(JEREMY LAUGHS)
-Don't like it!

1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:47.600
JEREMY: The next morning,
after eating the last
of our food,

1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:50.120
we resumed
our journey to Moron.

1:06:50.160 --> 1:06:54.520
We reckoned
we'd covered 350 miles.

1:06:54.560 --> 1:06:56.840
But as our map
was not to scale,

1:06:56.880 --> 1:07:00.720
we had no idea
how much was left to go.

1:07:00.760 --> 1:07:05.480
All we did know is that we
were hungry and worn out.

1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:08.280
I've got incredible aches and
pains across my shoulders.

1:07:08.320 --> 1:07:13.080
Well, there is no bit of me
that doesn't ache.

1:07:13.120 --> 1:07:17.000
There's no bit of me that's
warm, comfortable, dry,

1:07:17.040 --> 1:07:22.280
and I defecated
for the sixth, fifth,
sixth day on the trot

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:24.560
in a field like an animal.

1:07:24.600 --> 1:07:26.680
-(THUDS)
-Oh!

1:07:26.720 --> 1:07:28.920
-Oh, bloody...
-My back!

1:07:28.960 --> 1:07:30.320
I think we got
some air there.

1:07:30.360 --> 1:07:32.720
-(JAMES GROANS)
-Oh, shit.

1:07:32.760 --> 1:07:34.480
(JAMES GROANS)

1:07:34.520 --> 1:07:38.480
Oh, God, that was not good.

1:07:38.520 --> 1:07:41.720
Still, at least things
soon got worse.

1:07:41.760 --> 1:07:43.680
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

1:07:47.400 --> 1:07:49.280
Oh, brilliant.

1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.720
Just getting
a golden shower now.

1:07:51.760 --> 1:07:54.040
(ROARING WIND)

1:07:54.080 --> 1:07:57.680
Oh, jeez,
that's the worst it's been.

1:07:57.720 --> 1:08:00.840
JEREMY:
If there's a cliff at the top
of this, I'm going over.

1:08:00.880 --> 1:08:02.800
I'm just going to end it now.

1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:06.520
I want a glass of wine!

1:08:10.320 --> 1:08:12.640
We were aiming for
the next target on our map,

1:08:13.720 --> 1:08:15.720
which was Lots of Trees.

1:08:17.440 --> 1:08:19.960
And soon, we found them.

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:28.000
-Oh, look at that.
RICHARD: Wow!

1:08:28.040 --> 1:08:30.880
Wowee!

1:08:30.920 --> 1:08:35.080
Holy mother of God, what
an amazing place we're in.

1:08:37.320 --> 1:08:39.880
Next, we were looking
for the Big River,

1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:44.520
and to get a better view
we made once more
for high ground.

1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:51.280
-Come on, John.
-(JUDDERING AND RATTLING)

1:08:52.840 --> 1:08:54.760
Yes, you can do it.

1:08:58.520 --> 1:09:00.440
I'm sorry,
I find that quite funny.

1:09:00.520 --> 1:09:03.080
I think it's when he's happy.

1:09:03.120 --> 1:09:06.120
At the top,
there was no river in sight.

1:09:06.160 --> 1:09:08.120
Just more Mongolia.

1:09:10.040 --> 1:09:13.000
So we broke out the map.

1:09:13.040 --> 1:09:15.240
Right, we've got
a decision to make.

1:09:15.280 --> 1:09:16.800
I reckon we're here, OK?

1:09:16.840 --> 1:09:18.160
Cos we've done Lots of Trees,

1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:20.040
we're about just
sort the end of that bit.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:21.920
And we've got to cross this
river, whatever happens.

1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:26.320
We could go either this way
up north and around.

1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:28.120
That probably is
a bit further.

1:09:28.160 --> 1:09:29.920
Or we could go south.

1:09:29.960 --> 1:09:34.720
-That is a lot further
than that.
-Yes.

1:09:34.760 --> 1:09:36.760
But it ends in
the Deep River of Despair

1:09:36.800 --> 1:09:38.200
with crashing water
over rocks.

1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:39.800
They've...
It's illustrated on the map.

1:09:39.840 --> 1:09:42.040
-That does not...
-They made a point
of drawing it like that.

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:45.200
If we can't cross there,
we'll have to come all the
way back up and round anyway.

1:09:45.240 --> 1:09:47.120
If we go this way,
we'll find a track.

1:09:47.160 --> 1:09:50.080
There'll be a way along the
side, the flanks of that lot.

1:09:50.120 --> 1:09:52.320
-That valley there.
-Yes, round...

1:09:52.320 --> 1:09:53.960
-That's a long way round.
-I know, but...

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:57.400
It's further but it
doesn't have that in it.

1:09:57.440 --> 1:09:58.800
We are agreed,
then, gentlemen.

1:09:58.840 --> 1:10:00.520
-We are heading north.
-Yes.

1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:03.160
We're not interested
in pretty, we're not
interested in despair.

1:10:03.200 --> 1:10:04.960
We're interested in wine.

1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.640
-And the easiest route
is that one. There you go.
JEREMY: North.

1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:10.680
RICHARD: Saddle up.

1:10:10.720 --> 1:10:14.360
JEREMY: Our decision
had added yet more miles
to the journey.

1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:17.160
But there was
an upside to that.

1:10:17.200 --> 1:10:21.760
We would get to see more
of this achingly
beautiful country.

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:30.680
(WIND WHISTLES)

1:10:30.720 --> 1:10:32.520
Mongolia just changed again.

1:10:41.160 --> 1:10:43.600
-What was I not
expecting to see?
-Camels.

1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.240
Yep. What am I seeing?

1:10:48.760 --> 1:10:51.760
RICHARD:
Ooh. Pine. Smell. Ohh!

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:55.680
And that's real pine,
not pine out of a tin.

1:10:55.720 --> 1:10:58.240
JEREMY: I tell you what
I'll be able to do in here.
-What?

1:10:58.280 --> 1:11:00.320
Go off with my bow and arrow
and catch things.

1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:02.280
-Ha-ha-ha!
-What do you mean,
"Ha-ha-ha!"?

1:11:05.160 --> 1:11:09.040
-Look at that down there now.
-Look at the size
of that eagle on that rock!

1:11:09.080 --> 1:11:12.200
-Holy crap!
JAMES: Oh, God, yes.

1:11:12.240 --> 1:11:14.160
RICHARD: It's massive!

1:11:23.720 --> 1:11:25.520
RICHARD: It's gonna be weird
going home

1:11:25.560 --> 1:11:28.800
when you can't just
set off in the direction
you wanna go.

1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:30.800
-I wanna go over there.
-Go over there, then.

1:11:30.840 --> 1:11:32.560
It's gonna be really strange.

1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:39.280
JEREMY: Many hours later,
we still hadn't spotted
the river.

1:11:40.800 --> 1:11:42.880
Could you hear
my stomach rumbling?

1:11:42.920 --> 1:11:44.880
Not over my own, no.

1:11:44.920 --> 1:11:47.560
JEREMY: But then...

1:11:47.600 --> 1:11:49.600
-That's the river.
-What?

1:11:49.640 --> 1:11:52.640
That's the river.
I just saw it
at the foot of those hills.

1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:54.960
You didn't, Hammond.
Can you see a river, James?

1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:56.640
-No.
-Neither can I.

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:59.400
-It's the river
of gin in his imagination.
-He's gone mental.

1:11:59.440 --> 1:12:02.400
-You'll see it in a minute.
At the foot of that cliff.
-Oh, my...

1:12:02.440 --> 1:12:06.000
-Oh, he's right.
-Thank you.

1:12:06.040 --> 1:12:10.000
JEREMY: All we had to do now
was get down to it.

1:12:10.040 --> 1:12:13.160
And I had a simple plan.

1:12:13.200 --> 1:12:15.960
-Why don't we go down here?
-You don't know
what's over this edge.

1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:18.240
-It might be really steep
and horrible.
-It might be sheer.

1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:23.520
-(COMEDY VOICE) Relax!
-No, it's not relaxing.

1:12:23.560 --> 1:12:25.800
RICHARD: James, will you hold
it in low ratio?
-Yes, I am.

1:12:25.840 --> 1:12:27.240
Because if it pops out now...

1:12:27.280 --> 1:12:28.920
Then we would be in
a world of pain.

1:12:28.960 --> 1:12:30.880
We'd be doing a million
miles per hour by the time...

1:12:30.920 --> 1:12:32.440
JEREMY: Literally a million.

1:12:33.560 --> 1:12:35.720
(CLUNKING AND RATTLING)

1:12:39.240 --> 1:12:41.080
-It's steep, isn't it?
-It is steep!

1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:44.080
JEREMY:
It's steeper than I thought.

1:12:44.120 --> 1:12:47.320
Soon, though, thanks to my
brilliant plan and driving,

1:12:47.360 --> 1:12:48.760
we made it!

1:12:51.640 --> 1:12:55.040
JEREMY: Oh,
a smooth run to the river.

1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.320
Pop across it. Quick
evening drive into Moron.

1:12:59.320 --> 1:13:03.280
RICHARD: Yeah, we can
still get there tonight now.

1:13:03.320 --> 1:13:05.520
JEREMY: But then
when we arrived at the river,

1:13:05.560 --> 1:13:08.760
our hearts sank
into our empty stomachs.

1:13:11.560 --> 1:13:13.840
Look at what's on
the other side. I mean, look.

1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:16.120
-Yeah, that's...
-Observe to your left,
gentlemen.

1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:18.840
RICHARD: That is
a huge problem.
Well, we can't get out.

1:13:18.880 --> 1:13:21.960
JAMES: We'll not even
get up there, to be honest.
RICHARD: What do we do?

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.840
We have to do cross it.

1:13:23.880 --> 1:13:27.040
-The thing is,
it'll take us hours...
-Yeah.

1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:30.160
JAMES: Yeah.
-..to find somewhere
to cross.

1:13:30.200 --> 1:13:31.960
-Hours.
JAMES: And then
it'll be dark.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.560
-Yes.
-So...say it.

1:13:33.600 --> 1:13:35.720
We're going to--
Yes, we're going to
have to camp here.

1:13:35.760 --> 1:13:38.120
But we've got no food.

1:13:41.320 --> 1:13:43.800
JEREMY:
That wasn't quite true.

1:13:43.840 --> 1:13:46.600
We had some flour,
and a packet of creamer.

1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:50.040
Which we mixed with
some ice-sharp river water,

1:13:50.080 --> 1:13:52.520
and fresh herbs
to create a soup

1:13:52.560 --> 1:13:55.760
that was
surprisingly disgusting.

1:13:59.120 --> 1:14:01.960
And the next morning,
we began our search

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:03.920
for a crossing point.

1:14:05.400 --> 1:14:07.800
But hang on, is that a gap
coming up there?

1:14:07.840 --> 1:14:11.080
JEREMY: Even if we could
do 30 yards, look behind it.

1:14:11.120 --> 1:14:14.320
Look, we've got to turn
around and try the other way.

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:21.280
Hang on, hang on.
What about there?

1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:23.320
JAMES: Actually,
that looks quite good.

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:26.680
-There's basically a lawn
on the other side.
-The other side is fantastic.

1:14:26.720 --> 1:14:29.800
-And there's a gap
in the mountain.
-But look how deep it is.

1:14:29.840 --> 1:14:32.320
-Yeah, that's ten feet deep.
-Going to drown the car
getting across.

1:14:36.320 --> 1:14:40.600
JEREMY: Eventually though,
after several more miles
of searching...

1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:43.640
Wait a minute.
That looks extremely good.

1:14:43.680 --> 1:14:45.040
RICHARD: That's the way out.

1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:47.120
JEREMY: And the river's
shallow there. Can you see?

1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.160
-Where it's...
-That looks like
a bit of a gift.

1:14:53.760 --> 1:14:56.680
How deep do we think it is?

1:14:56.720 --> 1:15:00.840
RICHARD: It's broad here
so it won't have carved
a deep groove, will it?

1:15:00.880 --> 1:15:03.280
-Is that how it works?
-Let's go with that thought,
shall we?

1:15:03.320 --> 1:15:06.440
-Yeah, let's go with that.
-Or we could drive up
and down here until we die.

1:15:06.520 --> 1:15:09.840
I'm sick of driving up
and down. We can get out,
so let's get in.

1:15:09.880 --> 1:15:11.440
JAMES:
We can definitely go on.

1:15:11.520 --> 1:15:14.080
We've got a snorkel breather
on the engine.

1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:16.240
We cross the drink
and get a drink.

-Right.

-Oh, John is wading.

1:15:24.800 --> 1:15:27.840
Oh-ho! Whoa! That's...
that's glacial run-off,

1:15:27.880 --> 1:15:29.200
and it's unbelievably cold!

1:15:29.240 --> 1:15:31.240

Oh, no!
-Oh!

have a freezing starfish.
RICHARD: Oh!

1:15:34.040 --> 1:15:35.840

Please, I beg of you.

are spinning.

1:15:55.080 --> 1:15:56.640
Yeah, that's not working.

1:15:56.680 --> 1:15:58.440
I did feel us run over
a boulder or something.

1:15:58.520 --> 1:16:00.560
-Did you feel that?
-Yes.

1:16:00.600 --> 1:16:02.200

against that backwards.

-Did I just feel
the whole car move?
-Yes, you did.

1:16:06.600 --> 1:16:08.880
-That's the current.
JAMES: Forwards.

1:16:08.920 --> 1:16:12.520
We can't go forwards.
If that gets any deep...and
we've got inches in here,

1:16:12.560 --> 1:16:14.680

completely submerged,

underwater - end of.

was to reverse.

1:16:19.920 --> 1:16:23.320
Which meant we had
to free the rear wheels.

a transgender operation.

in there?

move again in the current.

1:16:44.960 --> 1:16:46.760
-Cut the doors off!
-Why cut the doors off?

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:50.000
-They're what's moving it.
-They're the only bit
I put on!

1:16:50.040 --> 1:16:52.000
Well, I don't care,
it's gonna kill
the whole car.

Oh, brilliant! So the only
contribution I made to John

1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:06.960
are now on their way
to Shanghai.

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:08.760
Now, though,
we could concentrate

1:17:08.800 --> 1:17:12.320

what was blocking us.

were jammed by big rocks.

-Can you move the rocks?
-Oh, yes, Hammond.

1:17:29.080 --> 1:17:31.360

May and Jeremy Clarkson.

for the job."

have to be like Titans.

move the big rock.

-In neutral,
I'm not going anywhere.
-Right.

-Come on, let's go, the
quicker we get this done.
-OK, counting down.

everything's fine back here.
-Good.

Hammond.
-Yeah.

1:18:47.680 --> 1:18:49.040
Right. Two things.

1:18:49.080 --> 1:18:52.760
The river's really cold,
and that bit's too deep.

1:18:52.800 --> 1:18:56.080
-Right. I think we need to
try another route.
-Yeah, we do.

1:18:56.120 --> 1:18:57.640
-Definitely.
-OK, get on board.

where the river seemed
to be shallower.

1:19:05.640 --> 1:19:07.280
Turn right. Now.

1:19:11.040 --> 1:19:13.080
Yeah, well done, top work.

JEREMY: Right, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:22.080
Yep. Right, now,
hang a diagonal.

1:19:22.120 --> 1:19:24.520
Aim for those - the gap
in the trees, do you see?

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.680
Really good.
This is good, this is good.

1:19:29.720 --> 1:19:31.200
If it doesn't go
suddenly deep.

1:19:35.600 --> 1:19:37.880
Oh, Christ,
we've gone deep again.

Right, keep going,
keep going, keep going.

1:19:46.320 --> 1:19:49.200

it's getting shallower.

1:19:49.240 --> 1:19:52.440
JAMES: Ah, yes!
RICHARD: Do you know,
I think we might make it.

JEREMY: Left hand down.
That's it. Left hand down.

1:19:55.640 --> 1:19:57.560

-I am staggered.
-Ha-ha-ha!

We're on our way to gin town.

1:20:08.320 --> 1:20:10.440
JEREMY:
Before moving on, though,

1:20:10.520 --> 1:20:12.640
we had to make
some modifications.

1:20:15.520 --> 1:20:18.840
We haven't driven John
as a convertible before
with the top down.

1:20:18.880 --> 1:20:22.000
No. We should explain,
the reason we're
driving with no roof,

1:20:22.040 --> 1:20:26.120
is because James has turned
it into a pair of trousers
cos his are wet.

1:20:26.160 --> 1:20:28.880
Hammond and I have
turned one of the tents
into a pair of trousers,

1:20:28.920 --> 1:20:31.760
so if we don't make
Moron tonight...

1:20:31.800 --> 1:20:35.800
Two of us are sharing.
You two will be all right in
a tent together, won't you?

JAMES: No.
JEREMY: Wrong.

1:20:39.520 --> 1:20:43.240
Now the river was behind us,
we had to work out
what lay ahead.

1:20:44.360 --> 1:20:47.160
Which was impossible.

1:20:47.200 --> 1:20:50.520
Oh, God. There's just
nothing marked on the map.

1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:53.360
It just is cross the river,
and then...nothing.

RICHARD: No.

1:20:55.360 --> 1:20:58.400
JEREMY: We were therefore
surprised a few miles later

1:20:58.440 --> 1:21:00.960
to find our route
was peppered by something

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.840
we hadn't encountered before.

for you and I to jump ship.

was a poor, poor idea.

JEREMY: Right,
what we're trying to do now,

1:21:54.960 --> 1:21:56.360
is because all the
weight's on the back,

1:21:56.400 --> 1:21:58.520
is actually reverse up.

1:22:22.200 --> 1:22:26.400

you're going down there,
down the gully,

and we're all saved.

it's capable of off-road.

RICHARD: Oh, my God!
JEREMY: Yes!
I've never been so happy...

1:25:48.640 --> 1:25:53.280
But we still had to make
a critical decision.

1:25:53.320 --> 1:25:55.240
RICHARD:
On one end of this...
JEREMY: Is Moron.

1:25:55.280 --> 1:25:57.080
-Yes.
-The question is:

1:25:57.120 --> 1:26:00.640
Do we go left...
or do we go right?

1:26:03.920 --> 1:26:06.360
-Right.
-Well, why right?

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:07.600
Because I'm very lucky.

1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:10.200
And it's lucky to go right
in Mongolia.

1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:12.640
-That's going to Moron.
-What if that just goes
all the way to nothing?

1:26:12.680 --> 1:26:14.720
-It won't go to nowhere.
-It'll go a power station.

1:26:14.760 --> 1:26:18.360
It'll go to Russia.
Go to a power station
in Russia is where it'll go.

1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:20.720
One end's got a power station
in Russia on the end of it.

1:26:20.760 --> 1:26:23.000
-The other
has a gin and tonic.
-And the other end... yeah.

1:26:23.040 --> 1:26:24.360
Has got a gin and tonic.

1:26:24.400 --> 1:26:26.120
RICHARD: We've decided.

1:26:26.160 --> 1:26:27.880
Let's just stick with it and
have faith in our decision.

1:26:27.920 --> 1:26:29.520
JEREMY: Yeah, just to be
crystal clear, though,

1:26:29.560 --> 1:26:31.120
-if this is wrong...
-I'll kill myself.

1:26:31.160 --> 1:26:33.280
...I will be the one
that says,
"I told you it was left."

1:26:33.320 --> 1:26:35.360
Yeah, I know you will.
But I'll have killed myself,

1:26:35.400 --> 1:26:37.320
so it doesn't matter,
I won't hear it.

1:26:40.040 --> 1:26:41.600
We needn't
have worried though,

1:26:41.640 --> 1:26:43.800
because just
a few miles later,

1:26:43.840 --> 1:26:48.840
we discovered that
in Mongolia it really is
lucky to turn right.

1:26:51.960 --> 1:26:54.200
What a heavenly sight.

1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:06.000
(EXHALES) How far away
do you reckon it is?

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:08.600
JAMES: 10K.

1:27:08.640 --> 1:27:10.840
-Come on, then, let's
get this thing finished.
-Let's do it.

1:27:10.880 --> 1:27:12.800
JAMES: Yeah.

1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:18.760
-It hasn't been easy, has it?
-It really hasn't.

1:27:18.800 --> 1:27:20.280
-God, no.
-It really hasn't. I mean...

1:27:20.320 --> 1:27:23.760
I'm just staggered that we
haven't killed ourselves,

1:27:23.800 --> 1:27:26.440
or each other, actually.

1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:29.480
Because while Mongolia
has just been...

1:27:29.520 --> 1:27:31.720
...a constant source
of wonderment,

1:27:31.760 --> 1:27:33.920
the actual business of
getting across it

1:27:33.960 --> 1:27:35.960
has been by far and away

1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:37.960
the most difficult,
gruelling,

1:27:38.000 --> 1:27:41.400
arduous journey...
we've ever done.

1:27:47.480 --> 1:27:49.880
Look!

1:27:49.920 --> 1:27:52.000
JAMES: I would say we've
got hundreds of components.

1:27:52.040 --> 1:27:54.600
They haven't sent any beer,
or gin or wine,

1:27:54.640 --> 1:27:56.120
or alcohol of any sort.

1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:57.800
-(THUDDING)
-Oh!

1:27:57.840 --> 1:28:00.040
RICHARD: God above!
JAMES: Let it end!

1:28:01.880 --> 1:28:03.960
-(ENGINE REVVING)
JAMES: That's what I meant.

1:28:08.720 --> 1:28:10.560
-(SQUELCHING)
-Oh, May!

1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:11.800
I've lost my shoes!

1:28:13.640 --> 1:28:15.760
-I can save this.
JEREMY: He's rolled it.

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.920
Brrr-brrr-brrr.

1:28:24.960 --> 1:28:26.200
RICHARD: Oh.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:32.040
Oh-ho, whoa! It's all
the way up to my arse!

1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:33.560
Aargh! (BLEEP)
Current's got me.

1:28:33.600 --> 1:28:35.480
(BLEEP) hell.

1:28:35.520 --> 1:28:38.720
(ENGINE REVVING, CLANKING)

1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:40.920
Aargh!

1:28:43.120 --> 1:28:45.240
JEREMY: Fact is, though,

1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:48.520
we couldn't have done
any of that without John.

1:28:48.560 --> 1:28:50.800
No. He's been incredible.

1:28:50.840 --> 1:28:52.400
There's something else,
you know.

1:28:52.440 --> 1:28:55.280
Even though we built it
in the middle of a field
in the dust,

1:28:55.320 --> 1:28:58.200
it has been
unutterably reliable.

1:28:58.240 --> 1:29:00.240
The only thing
we've had to do to this car

1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:02.400
-is change a fuse,
which took about 30 seconds.
-Yeah.

1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:05.080
But the moral of that is, if
you're going on an expedition

1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:10.080
and you're absolutely
dependent on your car
for your life...get a John.

1:29:10.120 --> 1:29:11.440
Yeah.

1:29:11.480 --> 1:29:12.480
Look.

1:29:14.640 --> 1:29:18.000
It's... I can't...
I'm so excited.

1:29:18.040 --> 1:29:21.120
-And thirsty. Ha-ha!
-Oh, my God.

1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:24.360
I've never wanted to arrive
anywhere more
than just there.

1:29:24.400 --> 1:29:27.160
-Here we go. As we go past
the sign, we're there.
-Oh, this is it!

1:29:27.200 --> 1:29:29.920
We are arriving,
and we are here!

1:29:29.960 --> 1:29:32.000
(CHEERING)

1:29:32.040 --> 1:29:34.800
-(LAUGHTER)
-We're in Moron!

1:29:34.840 --> 1:29:38.280
-Hello, Moron, we love you!
-Hello, Moron!

1:29:38.320 --> 1:29:41.000
-(LAUGHTER)
JEREMY: We have
travelled far.

1:29:41.040 --> 1:29:46.240
RICHARD: That was a journey!
-Yes, the smoothness.

1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:49.440
Oh, this is beautiful.
I like this Tarmac lark.

1:29:51.920 --> 1:29:55.440
-Right. We have now completed
Mr Wilman's mission.
-Yes.

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:59.040
-We must get on
with completing ours.
-Yes, where's the pub?

1:29:59.080 --> 1:30:00.440
-Exactly!
-Yes.

1:30:00.480 --> 1:30:02.480
Right,
and just another thing.

1:30:02.520 --> 1:30:04.560
As we've done Mr Wilman's
mission, this bit's for us.

1:30:04.600 --> 1:30:07.600
-James,
can I drive this bit?
-No chance.

1:30:07.640 --> 1:30:09.760
-Oh, come on.
-No, seriously, Hammond.

1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:13.200
No, it's not worth the risk
at this late stage of you
putting it on its side.

1:30:13.240 --> 1:30:15.320
-What risk? Well, a bit.
-There might be a bend.

1:30:15.360 --> 1:30:19.160
-It might say "Finish."
-There won't be a bend.

1:30:19.200 --> 1:30:21.280
You've had all the fun,
you've done
the exciting bits:

1:30:21.320 --> 1:30:23.360
the dunes and the mountains,
and the gullies

1:30:23.400 --> 1:30:25.600
-and the deserts,
and the forests.
-Yeah, and now the town.

1:30:25.640 --> 1:30:27.480
JEREMY: James.
-What?

1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:29.240
Seriously,
just to shut him up,

1:30:29.280 --> 1:30:32.120
why don't you
just let him have...a go?

1:30:32.160 --> 1:30:34.800
-What, really?
-Just let him drive.
Pull up here.

1:30:34.840 --> 1:30:36.200
-Seriously?
-Yes, honestly.

1:30:36.240 --> 1:30:38.160
-All right.
-Please pull up here.

1:30:38.200 --> 1:30:40.160
-It's your fault.
-Oh, yes.

1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:42.960
JEREMY: Unbelievable.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.520
-Right,
now you see some driving.
-There we go.

1:30:46.560 --> 1:30:48.560
-Whoa! Pub, pub, pub!
-What?

1:30:48.600 --> 1:30:50.880
-Whoa!
-I've only done two feet!

1:30:52.120 --> 1:30:54.040
(RATTLING)

1:30:56.000 --> 1:30:57.840
-It's shut.
JEREMY: What?

1:30:57.880 --> 1:30:59.800
It's shut.

1:31:02.280 --> 1:31:04.600
RICHARD: Do you know,
it is, as well.
-It is shut.

1:31:09.920 --> 1:31:11.720
And on that terrible
disappointment,

1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:13.200
it's time to end.

1:31:13.240 --> 1:31:15.440
Thank you so much
for watching. Goodbye.
