get set...

01:18.420 --> 01:20.170
Lieutenant Pug, sir!

01:20.170 --> 01:24.210
While Colonel Creampuff is away,
I'm in charge!

01:26.460 --> 01:27.750
Got it?

01:27.750 --> 01:29.000
Yes, sir!

01:29.000 --> 01:31.880
How very
"take charge" of you, sir.

01:31.880 --> 01:35.790
On your mark, get set, go!

01:42.250 --> 01:44.330
Three-leg wins!

01:46.080 --> 01:48.250
Again!

01:48.250 --> 01:51.710
And now for your reward.

01:53.750 --> 01:56.830
Hit the deck and give me...
20!

01:58.330 --> 01:59.830
Aww!

02:01.670 --> 02:04.420
And you, loser boy,

02:04.420 --> 02:07.830
hit the deck
and give me...

02:07.830 --> 02:08.920
50!

02:08.920 --> 02:10.580
Yes, sir.

02:10.580 --> 02:13.170

Lucky straining)

02:17.120 --> 02:19.500
Ohhh!

02:24.790 --> 02:27.670
Hit the deck

02:27.670 --> 02:29.250
three...

02:29.250 --> 02:31.920
I got it, I got it!

02:31.920 --> 02:33.880
♪♪

02:33.880 --> 02:37.580
What a bunch of pathetic
crybabies you are!

02:37.580 --> 02:38.960
By this time next week,

02:38.960 --> 02:41.880
we'll be running the drill
on unit cohesion.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.000
Huh?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.040
Unit cohesion.

02:44.040 --> 02:45.880
My favorite!

02:45.880 --> 02:50.290
All of us working together
as one big dog.

02:50.290 --> 02:52.380
What's your name, soldier?!

02:52.380 --> 02:53.880
Cadpig, sir.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.290
Hit the deck, pig dog,
and give me 30...

02:57.290 --> 02:58.670
seven!

02:58.670 --> 03:01.290
You know, sir,
the use of
pejorative labels

03:01.290 --> 03:05.120
only gives you
the illusion
of power.

03:05.120 --> 03:07.000
Make that 38!

03:07.000 --> 03:10.210
When I give the order,
you will divide into two teams

03:10.210 --> 03:12.420
to practice
the Bark Brigade march.

03:12.420 --> 03:15.880
You will learn how to march
the same, sound the same,

03:15.880 --> 03:17.420
look the same.

03:17.420 --> 03:22.290
Those of you who cohese
may become cadets.

03:22.290 --> 03:24.620
Do you hear me?

03:24.620 --> 03:26.040
Yes, sir!

03:26.040 --> 03:28.580
You, Three-leg,
and you, loser boy,

03:28.580 --> 03:31.330
you two are my team leaders.

03:31.330 --> 03:34.000
Huh! Must be my lucky day.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.120
Yes, sir!

03:35.120 --> 03:37.330
Pug: Pick your teams!

03:38.330 --> 03:39.620
Duke.

03:45.580 --> 03:48.330
I'll take... the bucket.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.120
Ohh.

03:50.120 --> 03:52.170
We're waiting, recruit-cake.

03:52.170 --> 03:53.960
Okay, okay.

03:53.960 --> 03:55.830
I'll take Spot.

03:55.830 --> 03:57.330
Yippee!

04:00.330 --> 04:01.790
Oww!

04:01.790 --> 04:04.040
Yeah, this is gonna work out

04:04.040 --> 04:06.170
just great.

04:07.250 --> 04:10.750
Okay, when I give
the count, march!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.880
Ruff-ruff, 1, 2.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.080
Ruff-ruff, 3, 4.

04:14.080 --> 04:16.420
Ruff-ruff, 1, 2.

04:16.420 --> 04:18.960
Ruff-ruff, 3, 4.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.000
Tripod: Steppin' proud
with head held high,

04:26.000 --> 04:27.830
raise my feet up
to the sky.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.000
March from sunup
till it's dark,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.670
feel my thunder,
hear my bark...

04:32.670 --> 04:36.250
Look at them.
Did you see that?

04:36.250 --> 04:38.040
I know what
you're thinking.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.330
They look better than we do.

04:40.330 --> 04:42.750
And it's the chicken's fault.

04:42.750 --> 04:45.670
At least you got
one thing right.

04:45.670 --> 04:48.750
We're supposed to march
the same and sound the same

04:48.750 --> 04:49.920
and look the same.

04:49.920 --> 04:53.040
We're supposed to be
one big dog.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.210
Well, we're close.

04:55.210 --> 04:58.120
We're one big dog
and a chicken.

04:58.120 --> 05:00.790
Yeah, b-but I can
be a big dog.

05:00.790 --> 05:02.710
Just give me
a chance, will ya?

05:02.710 --> 05:04.670
Watch this!

05:04.670 --> 05:05.960
Ohh! Awww!

05:05.960 --> 05:07.920
Whaaaaaa!

05:07.920 --> 05:10.210
Klutzy chicken.

05:17.040 --> 05:18.710
Lucky, what's the matter?

05:18.710 --> 05:21.000
You guys, we gotta
get rid of Spot.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.500
Why?

05:22.500 --> 05:25.750
To get into the cadets,
we have to look like a team.

05:25.750 --> 05:27.500
She just doesn't fit in.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.420
Let's celebrate our differences.

05:29.420 --> 05:32.000
There's a little chicken
in all of us.

05:32.000 --> 05:35.250
We'll just spread our wings
and have a group cluck.

05:40.790 --> 05:44.000
I'm with Lucky.
How do we get
the chicken to leave?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.540
Easy. We make it
her idea.

05:48.670 --> 05:50.080
Wag your tails, troops!

05:50.080 --> 05:52.500
Left, right, left, right.

05:52.500 --> 05:54.500
I said wag your tail,
chicken!

05:54.500 --> 05:56.960
I'm waggin', I'm waggin'!

05:56.960 --> 06:00.000
And what's with
the two

06:00.000 --> 06:02.290
Hey, two legs are all I've got.

06:02.290 --> 06:05.880
Listen, chicken, if you
wanna hang with the dogs,

06:05.880 --> 06:07.710
you've gotta walk
like a dog.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.500
Hmm.

06:12.670 --> 06:15.000
I don't know
what looks funnier:

06:15.000 --> 06:17.750
a bunch of puppies
playing army,

06:17.750 --> 06:20.920
or a chicken who thinks
she's a dog.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.540
Is this the Bark Brigade

06:23.540 --> 06:26.880
or the B

06:29.080 --> 06:31.880
I'm doing my best, sir.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.080
Pug: Oh, yeah?

06:33.080 --> 06:35.000
Let's see what you got.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.580
Fall in!

06:38.580 --> 06:40.120
Left face!

06:40.120 --> 06:41.750
Forward march!

06:46.120 --> 06:48.830
You can take the chicken
out of the henhouse,

06:48.830 --> 06:51.080
but you can't take the smell
out of the chicken.

06:51.080 --> 06:53.670
P-U!

06:53.670 --> 06:56.670
Take a bath,
feather girl!

06:56.670 --> 06:59.330
Ah-ha,
really, sir.

06:59.330 --> 07:02.460
Must you resort
to cheap personal
hygiene jokes

07:02.460 --> 07:04.880
simply to assert
your authority?

07:06.120 --> 07:10.380
I was talking
to that dumb cluck,
not you!

07:10.380 --> 07:14.000
So why don't you just
drop and give me...

07:14.000 --> 07:16.500
uh... thirty...

07:16.500 --> 07:18.000
seven!

07:20.250 --> 07:23.540
I am not dumb, sir!

07:23.540 --> 07:26.040
And I don't smell.

07:26.040 --> 07:30.500
And even though you are
my ranking officer,

07:30.500 --> 07:32.830
you have no right
to speak to me that way.

07:32.830 --> 07:35.620
So, if you don't mind,
I'd appreciate you showing me

07:35.620 --> 07:38.540
a little more respect
in the future.

07:40.250 --> 07:43.620
That's it, recruit.
You're out!

07:43.620 --> 07:47.420
You'll never be a cadet
as long as you live!

07:47.420 --> 07:49.830
What a coincidence.

07:49.830 --> 07:51.960
I was just leaving.

07:53.330 --> 07:55.380
Well, recruits.

07:55.380 --> 07:58.710
Looks like you don't have
a platoon anymore.

07:58.710 --> 08:02.330
And without a platoon,
you can't march in the drill,

08:02.330 --> 08:07.920
which means you can kiss
the Bark Brigade goodbye.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.790
Ha ha!
Heh heh heh heh!

08:12.790 --> 08:14.920
Well, you happy now?

08:14.920 --> 08:18.580
She may be just a chicken,
but she was our chicken!

08:18.580 --> 08:21.120
Hey, I'm the team leader,
I can do...

08:21.120 --> 08:22.830
What kind of team leader

08:22.830 --> 08:24.960
let's a teammate get
grilled like that?

08:24.960 --> 08:26.670
Hmm.

08:27.830 --> 08:31.420
Uh, is it just me,
or is anybody else
hungry?

08:33.120 --> 08:36.880
What was I supposed to do,
stand up for a chicken?

08:36.880 --> 08:39.170
I didn't even want her
on the team.

08:39.170 --> 08:41.830
Us dogs gotta stick together.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.210
Guys?

08:55.000 --> 08:56.880
Aaaah!

09:09.830 --> 09:10.670
Aaaaah!

09:10.670 --> 09:14.540
I gotta talk to Spot!

09:17.880 --> 09:21.960
Hmm. And what are
you doing here?

09:21.960 --> 09:25.540
Look, I couldn't even see
beyond my own spots.

09:25.540 --> 09:29.330
And I didn't think about
how to make the most
of our dog-chicken team.

09:29.330 --> 09:33.620
I wasn't much of a leader
to let Lieutenant Pug
talk to you that way.

09:33.620 --> 09:36.170
And what I said
wasn't much better.

09:36.170 --> 09:40.750
So I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

09:40.750 --> 09:42.170
I'm sorry.

09:43.580 --> 09:44.710
Keep talking.

09:44.710 --> 09:46.580
Well, it was really brave

09:46.580 --> 09:48.830
the way you stood up
to Lieutenant Pug.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.460
I wouldn't have had
the guts to do that.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.670
And look where it got me.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.420
Right back in the henhouse

09:55.420 --> 09:58.580
with no chance
of becoming a cadet.

09:58.580 --> 10:00.290
Not necessarily.

10:00.290 --> 10:01.540
Huh?

10:01.540 --> 10:02.960
I have a plan.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.460
March from sunup till it's dark,

10:05.460 --> 10:07.620
feel my thunder, hear my bark.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.790
What's Pug
gonna say?

10:10.790 --> 10:12.120
Who cares?

10:12.120 --> 10:13.710
The important thing is,

10:13.710 --> 10:15.540
we cohesed.

10:15.540 --> 10:17.210
Ready, troops?

10:17.210 --> 10:18.210
both: Ready.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.250
Charge!

10:20.250 --> 10:21.620
Pug: Hmmm?

10:41.120 --> 10:46.040
That was the most
disgusting display

10:46.040 --> 10:50.500
of insubordination
I have ever seen!

10:50.500 --> 10:53.500
You are all a disgrace!

10:53.500 --> 10:54.620
You are nothing --

10:54.620 --> 10:56.670
Ahem!

10:58.620 --> 11:01.670
Colonel, ha ha, sir.

11:01.670 --> 11:03.880
What are you doin' here?

11:03.880 --> 11:06.750
Well, I couldn't miss
this great moment,

11:06.750 --> 11:10.290
seeing you welcome
each of these fine pups

11:10.290 --> 11:12.620
into the Bark Brigade.

11:12.620 --> 11:15.080
Isn't that right,
Lieutenant?

11:15.080 --> 11:16.170
Sir, yes, sir!

11:16.170 --> 11:18.380
Very good.
Carry on, Lieutenant.

11:18.380 --> 11:20.670
Tripod, you and your team

11:20.670 --> 11:23.380
displayed hard work
and precision.

11:23.380 --> 11:27.040
And, Lucky, you get
special mention for your...

11:27.040 --> 11:29.040
uh, creativity, yes.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.290
Yes, very, uh, creative.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.290
Uh, thanks for
the ride, Cruella.

12:09.290 --> 12:11.040
You owe me.

12:17.830 --> 12:19.880
Cruella's purse!

12:21.580 --> 12:23.580
And it's full of moolah!

12:23.580 --> 12:25.380
Finally, I can have

12:25.380 --> 12:29.500
that crystal gazer's mood collar
I've always wanted.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.750
Finally, I can have
that Thunderbolt P.I. spy set.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.580
Finally, I can have
that afternoon

12:38.580 --> 12:41.920
at the Royal Hydrant Day Spa
for Dogs.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.540
Whoa, wait a minute!

12:44.540 --> 12:46.000
Hold on, stop!

12:46.000 --> 12:48.880
We cannot spend this money.
It's not ours.

12:48.880 --> 12:50.540
We have to return it.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.210
Return it? Hah!

12:52.210 --> 12:55.670
We don't even really know
who it belongs to.

12:55.670 --> 12:57.460
Besides, Spot, ever hear of,

12:57.460 --> 13:00.580
"Finders keepers,
losers weepers"?

13:00.580 --> 13:02.880
Nice try.

13:02.880 --> 13:05.290
But it's clearly
Cruella's purse.

13:05.290 --> 13:06.880
And I'll give you
two good reasons

13:06.880 --> 13:08.500
why we should
return it.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.290
One, it's not
our money to spend,

13:11.290 --> 13:14.210
and two, she might
think Anita stole it.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.380
And Anita does not
need that kind
of trouble.

13:16.380 --> 13:19.420
I didn't even think
of that consequence.

13:19.420 --> 13:22.170
I've been so selfish.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.620
I forgive myself.

13:27.420 --> 13:30.250
Spot: Somebody's gotta
take it up there.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.330
Lucky: Well, I'm not going.

13:32.330 --> 13:33.670
Ugggh!

13:35.290 --> 13:37.960
Hmm, never thought
of that option.

13:37.960 --> 13:42.120
Well, I, for one, am glad we did
the right thing and returned --

13:42.120 --> 13:43.920
Anita's purse?

13:43.920 --> 13:45.580
all: Anita's purse?

13:47.330 --> 13:49.170
$1,582.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.620
Why, that's the exact amount

13:50.620 --> 13:53.420
of Reggie and Anita's
monthly mortgage payment.

13:54.380 --> 13:58.500
Hmm, I suppose I should
return it to Anita.

13:58.500 --> 14:02.830
Then again, finders keepers,
losers weepers!

14:13.330 --> 14:16.040
Rolly: Thanks to you, we could
be in really big trouble.

14:16.040 --> 14:19.330
Oh, no, I am not
your scape-chicken.

14:19.330 --> 14:21.000
You're in this mess with me.

14:21.000 --> 14:23.420
Well, I guess it wasn't
so clear

14:23.420 --> 14:26.210
that it wasn't
Cruella's purse after all.

14:26.210 --> 14:29.500
Yeah, we just assumed
that it was Cruella's purse.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.330
We didn't even think
to look beyond the moolah

14:31.330 --> 14:33.210
to see the other evidence.

14:33.210 --> 14:36.670
Boy, jumping to conclusions
sure is expensive.

14:36.670 --> 14:39.000
Okay, we made a mistake,
but we can fix it

14:39.000 --> 14:40.790
before it's too late.

14:40.790 --> 14:42.620
Come on, we gotta
get it back.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.620
Oh, and I suppose
you think Cruella's

14:57.620 --> 15:01.290
just gonna leave the money
in some easy-to-get-to place.

15:01.290 --> 15:03.380
Cruella!

15:03.380 --> 15:06.500
Cruella: Now, where should I
put the money?

15:06.500 --> 15:09.420
Oh, I know,
I'll put it right here.

15:09.420 --> 15:11.420
Mwah!

15:12.710 --> 15:14.420
You were saying?

15:16.040 --> 15:17.500
Wait a minute.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.960
I can't put it there.

15:18.960 --> 15:23.830
Some mangy, sniveling
puppy might sneak in
and steal it.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.750
Where can I hide it?

15:30.830 --> 15:34.420
No, no, no, no, too wet.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.290
Too... ...

15:41.290 --> 15:42.750
dusty.

15:49.750 --> 15:52.250
Uhhh! Too smelly.

15:52.250 --> 15:55.170
You could hide it in
a shoebox in your closet.

15:55.170 --> 15:58.000
Yeah, I hide
all my shoeboxes
in the closet.

16:00.330 --> 16:02.670
Uggh! You're fired!

16:04.380 --> 16:08.460
I've got to find
the perfect hiding place.

16:08.460 --> 16:09.790
Hmm.

16:11.080 --> 16:14.420
I know, I'll hide it
in a shoebox in my closet!

16:14.420 --> 16:17.420
Hmm, but I'll need guards.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.250
You two, you're hired.

16:24.460 --> 16:28.040
This is watchdog 1.
East wing clear, over.

16:28.040 --> 16:31.250
This is, uh...
wiener dog 7.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.420
Uh, whatever
you said, over.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.670
Look at 'em.

16:36.670 --> 16:39.620
Spot: They'll never leave
their posts.

16:39.620 --> 16:42.580
Rolly: They're like robots.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.120
Where there's
a strategy,
there's a way.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.250
It just takes
knowing the weakness
of the enemy.

16:48.250 --> 16:52.380
And I have a pretty
good idea what
their weaknesses are.

16:52.380 --> 16:53.710
Here's the plan.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.040
Welcome to
the Commercial Channel.

17:03.040 --> 17:05.000
All commercials, all the time!

17:05.000 --> 17:07.040
And now a word
from our sponsor.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.040
Wiener dog.

17:11.040 --> 17:13.500
Do you smell
something?

17:13.500 --> 17:15.330
No. Over.

17:15.330 --> 17:16.920
Wait a minute.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.620
Wait a minute,
watchdog.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.290
I smell junk food.

17:20.290 --> 17:23.830
And I hear a TV!

17:26.620 --> 17:28.250
both: Ohh!

17:32.540 --> 17:34.210
man: And that's not all.

17:34.210 --> 17:36.960
With your $48.95 purchase
of Rugley's Clip-on Hair,

17:36.960 --> 17:41.500
you'll also receive our new
Clip-on Pen absolutely free!

17:41.500 --> 17:43.790
Clip-on Pen!

17:43.790 --> 17:46.620
Oh, if only
I had the money!

17:46.620 --> 17:49.210
Lucky: Cruella's closet!

17:49.210 --> 17:51.120
all: Wow!

17:54.420 --> 17:58.250
A closet says so much about
a person's innermost being.

17:58.250 --> 18:01.120
I sense Cruella's closet
is saying...

18:01.120 --> 18:03.120
"I think I'm
gonna throw up"?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.920
Forget what the closet
is saying.

18:05.920 --> 18:10.080
Cruella said she hid
Anita's money inside a shoebox.

18:12.120 --> 18:14.290
Cadpig: She sure does
like shoes.

18:14.290 --> 18:16.290
Lucky: And I bet you anything

18:16.290 --> 18:19.120
it's in the one
at the very, very top.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.120
And your reasoning is...?

18:21.120 --> 18:24.170
'Cause it's
the hardest one
to get to, that's why.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.460
Wait a minute.

18:25.460 --> 18:29.250
Let's not jump to conclusions
like we did when we assumed

18:29.250 --> 18:31.250
that this was Cruella's purse.

18:31.250 --> 18:33.880
That's what got us into
this mess in the first place.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.040
Maybe Cruella was thinking
that we'd think that she'd think

18:37.040 --> 18:39.000
to put it in
the very hardest place!

18:39.000 --> 18:41.040
Maybe she put it in
a perfectly easy

18:41.040 --> 18:43.330
and obvious place
like right here.

18:43.330 --> 18:45.540
Hey, I was right.

18:47.750 --> 18:49.170
Aaaaaah!

18:51.040 --> 18:53.040
Making toast is as easy
as making toast

18:53.040 --> 18:55.210
with the toast toaster
toaster oven!

18:55.210 --> 18:58.420
Yours for three easy
installments of $79.95.

18:58.420 --> 19:00.000
Toasting filament not included.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.880
If only I had
the money.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.210
Come on, let's get outta here!

19:15.710 --> 19:17.290
The door's gone!

19:17.290 --> 19:20.290
Where's the door?
Where's the door?

19:20.290 --> 19:26.080
Oh, no, we're stuck --
stuck -- stuck in here forever!

19:26.080 --> 19:29.210
Become a professional ballerina
in three easy lessons

19:29.210 --> 19:31.120
for only $99.99.

19:31.120 --> 19:34.250
both: If only we had the money.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.500
Hey, watchdog,
we could borrow
some money

19:37.500 --> 19:39.210
from that purse
in the closet.

19:39.210 --> 19:42.080
And how would we
pay it back, wiener dog?

19:42.080 --> 19:43.420
Are you low on cash?

19:43.420 --> 19:46.080
Dying to borrow money but don't
know how to pay it back?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.920
Play Super Duper
Legal State Lottery!

19:48.920 --> 19:52.080
The jackpot is up
to $29 trillion!

19:53.120 --> 19:56.920
both, chuckling: Ahhh!

20:03.880 --> 20:05.960
Doggone it!

20:06.960 --> 20:08.880
Horace: We'll win the lottery,
repay the money,

20:08.880 --> 20:11.040
and buy all the cool stuff
we saw on the television.

20:11.040 --> 20:12.290
Quick, everybody --

20:12.290 --> 20:13.330
Panic!

20:13.330 --> 20:16.000
Don't panic.
Creativity has no limits.

20:16.000 --> 20:19.170
I know,
make like fuzzy slippers!

20:23.830 --> 20:25.290
Jasper: Just find
the money, Horace.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.920
She hid it in a shoebox.

20:26.920 --> 20:28.580
Ah, look how cute.

20:28.580 --> 20:31.460
I've just gotta try these on.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.790
The money!

20:34.790 --> 20:36.330
-Yowwww!

20:36.330 --> 20:37.420
Watchdog, help!

20:37.420 --> 20:39.710
The slippers are stealing
the money!

20:39.710 --> 20:42.120
It's just the puppies,
you wiener dog!

20:43.250 --> 20:45.040
Get 'em!

21:00.830 --> 21:02.580
Where did they go?

21:02.580 --> 21:03.960
I feel pretty.

21:07.210 --> 21:09.580
Welcome to Cruella's
automated closet.

21:09.580 --> 21:12.380
Please keep your paws
inside the coat at all times.

21:12.380 --> 21:15.000
On your left, business suits,
casual suits, law suits.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.750
On your right, evening wear,
swimwear, underwear.

21:17.750 --> 21:18.960
dogs: Yuck!

21:19.920 --> 21:22.210
Bellbottoms and bloomers,
hip-huggers and boots, skirts,

21:22.210 --> 21:24.250
petticoats and pantaloons,
muumuus and miniskirts,

21:24.250 --> 21:26.210
cardigans and kimonos,
tutus and t-shirts,

21:26.210 --> 21:28.670
and, just ahead, lingerie!

21:28.670 --> 21:30.290
Aaaaaaah!

21:30.290 --> 21:32.330
Ohhhh!

21:35.920 --> 21:36.920
Hmm.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.120
Ohh! Why, you!

21:44.120 --> 21:46.830
You know,
with the right belt,

21:46.830 --> 21:48.580
that would look fabulous!

21:50.670 --> 21:53.960
Roger!
Here's the purse right here.

21:55.290 --> 21:56.960
Ah, thank goodness.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.000
We did it.

21:59.000 --> 22:00.710
We returned
Anita's purse

22:00.710 --> 22:03.710
and we saved
the farm!

22:03.710 --> 22:07.170
To think we were
gonna spend that money
like it was ours. Over.

22:07.170 --> 22:08.750
Roger that.

22:08.750 --> 22:12.040
It's just
like posing as
a security guard, over.
