01:25.467 --> 01:28.067
How's dinner, Elaine? Hmm?

01:28.133 --> 01:29.400
Good, huh?

01:29.467 --> 01:31.234
Yeah, it's great.

01:31.300 --> 01:32.767
It's great.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.334
I really appreciate this, guys.

01:35.400 --> 01:36.767
Don't thank us, Elaine.

01:36.834 --> 01:39.033
Seeing you cheer up
is reward enough.

01:39.100 --> 01:40.234
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.834
I know I'm not responding much,

01:42.901 --> 01:46.767
but I just don't bounce back
the way I used to.

01:46.834 --> 01:48.000
Hey, believe me,

01:48.067 --> 01:50.100
no guy's worth
getting this upset over.

01:50.167 --> 01:51.434
No?

01:51.501 --> 01:53.200
Elaine, you know what
I think you should do?

01:53.267 --> 01:55.567
I think you should go out
with someone else right away.

01:55.634 --> 01:57.400
That's a good idea.

01:57.467 --> 01:58.701
I'm not talking
about falling in love,

01:58.767 --> 01:59.968
or, you know,
getting involved.

02:00.033 --> 02:01.300
I mean, just go out
with somebody else,

02:01.367 --> 02:02.300
but right away.

02:02.367 --> 02:03.701
I don't know anybody else.

02:03.767 --> 02:06.601
Well, what about a stranger?

02:06.667 --> 02:09.633
Maybe she don't
know any strangers.

02:09.701 --> 02:14.000
Boy, you got
all the answers.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.133
Hey, everybody.
Guess what?

02:15.200 --> 02:16.133
I got a part.

02:16.200 --> 02:17.133
TONY:
All right!

02:17.200 --> 02:18.434
ALEX:
Congratulations.

02:18.501 --> 02:19.400
TONY:
This calls for
a celebration.

02:19.467 --> 02:20.601
Next round of drinks is on me.

02:20.667 --> 02:21.801
No, no, no.

02:21.868 --> 02:23.100
I got the part, I insist,

02:23.167 --> 02:24.501
I want to pay for my own drink.
Not a chance.

02:24.567 --> 02:25.901
Hey, Elaine, help
me go get 'em?

02:25.968 --> 02:27.334
No, I don't...
Come on, come on.

02:27.400 --> 02:28.868
The walk will
do you good.

02:28.934 --> 02:30.868
Come on, baby.
Put it there. Hey.

02:30.934 --> 02:32.701
Sit down, Bob.
Get a chair.

02:32.767 --> 02:33.834
So, tell me, tell me, huh?

02:33.901 --> 02:35.167
What's the part?
What's the part?

02:35.234 --> 02:37.133
Well, it's in
an off-Broadway play

02:37.200 --> 02:40.634
and I've been doing
a lot of thinking about it.

02:40.701 --> 02:43.000
Uh, excuse me. Hi.

02:43.067 --> 02:44.567
Are you two together?

02:44.634 --> 02:45.901
Yeah, we're together.

02:45.968 --> 02:48.167
Oh, whoa.
You mean she and I?

02:48.234 --> 02:49.400
No, no, no, no, no.

02:49.467 --> 02:50.934
We're just friends.

02:51.000 --> 02:54.167
Uh, I'm Tony Banta,
and this is Elaine Nardo.

02:54.234 --> 02:55.400
Pleased to meet you.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.601
Kirk Bradshaw.

02:56.667 --> 02:59.367
And we're pleased
to meet you, huh, Elaine?

02:59.434 --> 03:00.734
Yeah, right. Hi.

03:00.801 --> 03:02.734
So, Kirk,
you come here often?

03:02.801 --> 03:04.701
Yeah, well, my office
is just around the corner.

03:04.767 --> 03:05.801
Oh, yeah, what do you do?

03:05.868 --> 03:06.968
I'm
an investment analyst.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.300
Wow...

03:08.367 --> 03:10.467
An invest... an
investment analyst.

03:10.534 --> 03:13.133
Uh, small world.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.467
Why, are you
an investment analyst?

03:14.534 --> 03:17.334
Nah, cabdriver.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.434
Hey, Kirk,
are you married?

03:19.501 --> 03:20.868
No, Tony, I'm not.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.801
Great. I got some people
I want you to meet.

03:22.868 --> 03:23.801
Come on over.

03:23.868 --> 03:25.367
Hey, guys.

03:25.434 --> 03:26.767
This is Kirk Bradshaw.

03:26.834 --> 03:28.968
He's an investment analyst
from here in New York,

03:29.033 --> 03:30.434
and he's not married.

03:30.501 --> 03:33.901
Why do I feel like I'm
watching a game show?

03:33.968 --> 03:36.100
Tell us
what he's won, Tony.

03:36.167 --> 03:39.100
Kirk, this is Alex,
Bobby, Latka, Jim,

03:39.167 --> 03:41.467
and of course,
you know Elaine.

03:41.534 --> 03:43.567
Oh, sure, we go way back.

03:43.634 --> 03:45.234
JIM:
Sit down, Kirk.

03:45.300 --> 03:48.167
Any friend of Elaine's
is a friend of ours.

03:48.234 --> 03:49.834
TONY:
Yeah, we got a
good seat for you

03:49.901 --> 03:51.267
right over here.

03:55.300 --> 03:59.400
So, Kirk, let me tell you
a little bit about Elaine.

03:59.467 --> 04:00.601
She's a cabdriver,

04:00.667 --> 04:03.000
but she also works
in an art gallery.

04:03.067 --> 04:05.033
Really?
I'm kind of an art buff.

04:05.100 --> 04:07.467
Ooh!
Hey, an art buff.

04:07.534 --> 04:10.000
I'm strictly an amateur
art buff, of course.

04:10.067 --> 04:11.234
What kind of stuff you like?

04:11.300 --> 04:13.534
Ah, just the simple
stuff, I guess.

04:13.601 --> 04:15.334
French impressionists.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.300
French impressionists--
that's her favorite.

04:17.367 --> 04:18.466
Oh, my God.
Ooh-la-la!

04:20.733 --> 04:21.666
Come on, will ya?

04:21.733 --> 04:22.601
Come on,
you're embarrassing her.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.000
No, it's okay.
It's okay.

04:24.067 --> 04:27.767
I own a couple of pen and
ink drawings by Degas.

04:27.834 --> 04:29.267
Really!
You got the real stuff.

04:29.334 --> 04:31.667
Oh, hey, I think Elaine
would like to see those.

04:31.734 --> 04:33.434
Oh, I'm really
sorry about this.

04:33.501 --> 04:34.934
How about tomorrow
night, Elaine?

04:37.934 --> 04:39.567
How about for dinner?

04:39.634 --> 04:40.801
Oh, do you know

04:40.868 --> 04:42.801
what you're putting
this poor man through?

04:42.868 --> 04:44.834
How about dinner
tomorrow night, Elaine?

04:44.901 --> 04:47.300
I'd really like to,
seriously.

04:47.367 --> 04:48.701
I'm so embarrassed.

04:48.767 --> 04:49.834
I wish you wouldn't be.

04:49.901 --> 04:51.133
I'd love to show
you my drawings.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.767
Oh...

04:54.801 --> 04:57.667
Well, uh...
it might be fun.

04:57.734 --> 05:01.100
Um, why don't you call me?

05:01.167 --> 05:02.200
Let me give you
my phone number.

05:02.267 --> 05:03.934
Here, here, I'll do it.
I'll get it.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.934
BOTH:
5-5-5...

05:06.000 --> 05:07.100
4-2-7...
4-4-2-4.

05:07.167 --> 05:08.234
4-2-7...

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
ALEX/TONY:
4-2-7-6.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.767
...7-6.

05:11.834 --> 05:12.934
Here you go.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.367
5-5...

05:14.434 --> 05:16.267
Jim, Jim...

05:16.334 --> 05:17.734
we got it.

05:17.801 --> 05:19.400
Nice meeting you all.
Nice to meet
you, Kirk.

05:19.467 --> 05:20.634
See you tomorrow night,
Elaine.

05:20.701 --> 05:21.801
Okay. Bye-bye.

05:21.868 --> 05:23.467
ALEX:
So long, Kirk.

05:23.534 --> 05:25.400
Great guy.

05:25.467 --> 05:27.968
Yes, he's very nice. Okay?

05:28.033 --> 05:31.334
Uh, he seemed
a little pushy to me.

05:41.133 --> 05:44.868
( <i>Elaine humming</i> )

05:46.901 --> 05:49.000
( <i>humming continues</i> )

05:49.067 --> 05:51.534
Anybody notice who's been
going around singing lately?

05:51.601 --> 05:53.701
Is it me?

05:53.767 --> 05:55.767
Yes. I've certainly
noticed a change

05:55.834 --> 05:59.434
in a certain person's morale
in the last ten days or so.

05:59.501 --> 06:01.167
I'm not denying it.

06:01.234 --> 06:02.868
It goes
beyond singing.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.968
I've noticed somebody
walking around

06:05.033 --> 06:07.434
whistling and giggling
like a schoolgirl.

06:07.501 --> 06:08.767
That's a lie.

06:08.834 --> 06:12.167
Not you, Jim-- Elaine.

06:12.234 --> 06:13.567
Oh, Elaine, uh,
it wouldn't have

06:13.634 --> 06:14.968
anything to do
with your seeing

06:15.033 --> 06:16.534
a lot of this
Kirk Bradshaw lately,

06:16.601 --> 06:17.767
now would it?

06:17.834 --> 06:18.934
He's a terrific guy.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.767
( <i>phone ringing</i> )
I'll get it!

06:20.834 --> 06:21.968
So, Elaine,

06:22.033 --> 06:24.467
we're pretty good matchmakers,
huh?

06:24.534 --> 06:25.868
Oh, will you quit gloating?

06:25.934 --> 06:28.067
Although, I must admit
that you picked out

06:28.133 --> 06:30.367
a better one for me
than I usually do.

06:30.434 --> 06:31.901
Oh, a winner
the first time out.

06:31.968 --> 06:33.467
Mr. Banta, congratulations.

06:33.534 --> 06:34.968
Nardo...

06:35.033 --> 06:37.000
928.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.133
Hey, Tony, it's for you.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.400
It's the guy from the gym.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.167
He says you owe a
towel fee from April.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.300
He's crazy.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.901
I didn't shower
in April.

06:44.968 --> 06:46.701
Hey, Louie, come on, huh?

06:46.767 --> 06:48.434
Get us out of here.

06:48.501 --> 06:51.133
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
here you go, here you go.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.634
Dames. Sheesh.

06:52.701 --> 06:54.467
"Sheesh," Louie?

06:54.534 --> 06:55.701
Yeah.

06:55.767 --> 06:58.200
No matter how many bums
a woman dates,

06:58.267 --> 07:00.167
whenever a new one comes along,

07:00.234 --> 07:02.300
she thinks this one
is going to be Mr. Right.

07:02.367 --> 07:03.567
You ever notice that?

07:03.634 --> 07:04.734
Notice it?

07:04.801 --> 07:07.167
I depend on it.

07:07.234 --> 07:08.534
Come on, Lou.

07:08.601 --> 07:09.901
Rieger, do you
hate anything

07:09.968 --> 07:11.167
as much as I
hate Wheeler?

07:11.234 --> 07:13.133
I doubt it.

07:13.200 --> 07:14.501
Have a terrible
evening, Lou.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.000
Same to you, Rieger.

07:16.067 --> 07:18.033
Ignatowski!

07:18.100 --> 07:19.167
Yo.

07:19.234 --> 07:20.934
Starship 314.

07:23.634 --> 07:26.167
LOUIE:
Banta, come on,
look alive here!

07:26.234 --> 07:28.067
One second, Lou.
One second.

07:28.133 --> 07:30.100
Hey, hey. Who are you?

07:30.167 --> 07:31.467
Kirk Bradshaw.

07:31.534 --> 07:32.968
And who are you?

07:33.033 --> 07:35.701
In here, God.

07:35.767 --> 07:37.400
Oh, oh. Kirk.

07:37.467 --> 07:38.801
Kirk Bradshaw.

07:38.868 --> 07:40.734
Oh, you're the young fellow

07:40.801 --> 07:42.767
who's dating our Miss Nardo.

07:42.834 --> 07:43.701
That's right.

07:43.767 --> 07:44.801
How far did you get?

07:47.133 --> 07:50.067
Come on. Come on,
a little guy-talk here.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.601
Did you hit a home run?

07:52.667 --> 07:55.567
Come on, I'm not going
to tell anybody.

07:55.634 --> 07:57.133
I'm not going
to tell you anything

07:57.200 --> 07:59.300
about my relationship
with Elaine.

07:59.367 --> 08:01.567
Well, some friend you are, Kirk.

08:03.701 --> 08:04.934
What was that about?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.100
Aw, he's a jerk.

08:06.167 --> 08:07.267
Hey, so,
how you doing, Kirk?

08:07.334 --> 08:08.434
Pretty good.

08:08.501 --> 08:09.934
Pretty good,
you son of a gun, you.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.767
You and Elaine seeing
a lot of each other.

08:11.834 --> 08:13.100
Oh, yeah.

08:13.167 --> 08:14.934
Yeah,
you son of a gun, you.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.934
That's why I stopped by,
I wanted to talk to her.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.100
Well,
you just missed her.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.467
She just went out.

08:19.534 --> 08:22.133
Oh? Just as well, I guess.

08:22.200 --> 08:23.801
What's the matter,
you two got a problem?

08:23.868 --> 08:25.067
Yeah. I'm afraid so.

08:25.133 --> 08:27.667
I've been meaning to
talk to her about it

08:27.734 --> 08:29.033
ever since I met her.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.000
I just can't seem
to be able to.

08:31.067 --> 08:32.133
Well, sit down.

08:32.200 --> 08:33.366
Tell me about it.

08:33.433 --> 08:34.467
Come on.

08:34.534 --> 08:35.501
See...

08:35.567 --> 08:37.333
I'm in a tough spot.

08:37.400 --> 08:39.534
I really like Elaine...

08:39.601 --> 08:41.868
You son of a gun, you.

08:41.933 --> 08:45.334
Tony, the problem is I
like somebody else, too.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.501
Oh... somebody else.

08:47.567 --> 08:50.367
Oh, man, that's a problem.

08:50.434 --> 08:52.033
It is a problem, Tony.

08:52.100 --> 08:53.601
I feel bad about it.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.367
I honestly never meant
to get involved with Elaine.

08:56.434 --> 08:59.200
Remember the night
I came up to you two at the bar?

08:59.267 --> 09:00.968
I said, "Are you two together?"

09:01.033 --> 09:04.367
Yeah, I told you we weren't.

09:04.434 --> 09:05.667
Well,

09:05.734 --> 09:09.567
she wasn't the one
I was after, Tony.

09:14.801 --> 09:16.467
Oh, no?

09:20.534 --> 09:23.267
No.

09:32.901 --> 09:36.133
Oh, no, no, no, no...

09:47.701 --> 09:49.267
Banta, what the
hell's going on here?

09:49.334 --> 09:50.701
You're supposed to
be out on the road.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.000
I ain't going, Louie.

09:52.067 --> 09:53.033
I got a problem.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.934
Aw, not again.

09:55.000 --> 09:57.634
The one on the left's the brake.

09:57.701 --> 10:00.167
The one on the right's the gas.

10:00.234 --> 10:01.734
Louie, leave me alone.

10:01.801 --> 10:04.634
Something's really
bothering you, huh, Banta?

10:04.701 --> 10:05.934
Yeah.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.968
So, why haven't you
unloaded it on Rieger?

10:08.033 --> 10:10.300
'Cause everybody's
always unloading on Alex,

10:10.367 --> 10:11.734
and it's terrible for him.

10:11.801 --> 10:13.567
I ain't dumping this one on him.

10:14.601 --> 10:16.801
Oh...

10:18.868 --> 10:20.834
Oh, I see what
you're getting at.

10:20.901 --> 10:24.167
Well, who else in
this cab company

10:24.234 --> 10:29.167
would offer the maturity,
the character, and poise

10:29.234 --> 10:33.501
required to be a
real confidant?

10:33.567 --> 10:34.868
Uh...

10:34.934 --> 10:39.067
You pick me or your butt's
flying out of here.

10:39.133 --> 10:40.834
No way you can make me
tell you this, Louie.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.501
Okay, okay, Tony.
All right.

10:42.567 --> 10:45.667
I know exactly
how you feel.

10:45.734 --> 10:47.701
I got problems
of my own.

10:47.767 --> 10:50.200
You ain't got
no problem like this one.

10:50.267 --> 10:51.567
Maybe, maybe not.

10:51.634 --> 10:54.234
I don't know anything
about your problems

10:54.300 --> 10:55.801
so I really don't know.

10:55.868 --> 10:57.434
But my problems...
yecch!

10:57.501 --> 10:59.434
Yecch!

10:59.501 --> 11:01.801
I'll tell you,
some of them...

11:01.868 --> 11:03.834
ah, I just
don't even want

11:03.901 --> 11:05.534
to think about them.

11:06.567 --> 11:09.501
Especially...

11:09.567 --> 11:11.701
that one.

11:15.534 --> 11:18.000
What one?

11:18.067 --> 11:19.834
Ah, never mind.

11:24.367 --> 11:26.534
Believe me, there's
nothing in this world

11:26.601 --> 11:27.868
that I'd like better

11:27.934 --> 11:30.667
than to share this with
another human being.

11:30.734 --> 11:32.234
I mean, just one time

11:32.300 --> 11:34.667
to have another
person understand

11:34.734 --> 11:39.167
what I live with
every day of my life.

11:39.234 --> 11:41.000
You know, if there was
anybody that I would tell,

11:41.067 --> 11:42.501
it would be you, Tony.

11:42.567 --> 11:44.501
My <i>paisano.</i>

11:44.567 --> 11:47.234
( <i>speaking Italian</i> )

11:47.300 --> 11:49.367
( <i>Speaking Italian</i> )

11:49.434 --> 11:52.167
Aw, I just can't do it.

11:52.234 --> 11:54.868
Unless...

11:54.934 --> 11:56.767
Unless what?

11:56.834 --> 12:00.133
Well...

12:00.200 --> 12:01.334
if you were to tell me

12:01.400 --> 12:03.300
about that little
problem of yours--

12:03.367 --> 12:05.534
I mean, just as
an act of faith--

12:05.601 --> 12:06.801
Oh, I don't know.

12:06.868 --> 12:08.467
Oh, no, no, never
mind, never mind.

12:08.534 --> 12:10.634
This is better kept

12:10.701 --> 12:14.934
in the deep, dark
recesses of my soul.

12:21.701 --> 12:25.701
Hey, Louie, it's not good
to keep things inside you

12:25.767 --> 12:27.701
where they can eat at you.

12:27.767 --> 12:29.767
Okay, Lou,
let's trade secrets.

12:35.901 --> 12:37.167
Thanks, Tony.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.200
All right,
I'll tell you what.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.334
Just so that
neither one of us

12:41.400 --> 12:43.567
has to say these things
out loud,

12:43.634 --> 12:46.133
we'll write them on
a piece of paper,

12:46.200 --> 12:47.834
and then
we'll trade secrets.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.701
Good idea, Louie.

12:57.267 --> 12:58.367
Pencil.

12:58.434 --> 12:59.767
Oops. I got it.

12:59.834 --> 13:01.100
Okay.

13:06.634 --> 13:09.133
Oh, I can't go through
with this.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.300
I can't go through with this.

13:11.367 --> 13:13.300
Oh, come on, Lou.
It will help you.

13:13.367 --> 13:16.067
I think it's helping me. <i>Paisan.</i>

13:23.200 --> 13:27.701
All right, but after,
we'll burn the pieces of paper.

13:27.767 --> 13:29.200
Sure.

13:39.934 --> 13:42.868
"The guy Elaine
is going out with

13:42.934 --> 13:45.100
just made
a pass at me"?

13:47.133 --> 13:48.934
Oh...

14:02.167 --> 14:04.334
Now I'll read yours, okay?

14:09.033 --> 14:10.968
"Ha, ha."

14:11.067 --> 14:14.467
Ha, ha.

14:14.534 --> 14:16.334
Hey, Louie...

14:16.400 --> 14:17.567
Ha, ha.

14:20.300 --> 14:23.133
You're my favorite,
Banta!

14:23.200 --> 14:25.367
( <i>shouting indistinctly</i> )

14:27.701 --> 14:29.634
Hey, Tony,
how's it going?

14:29.701 --> 14:31.100
Not great.

14:31.167 --> 14:32.467
Why aren't you drinking?

14:32.534 --> 14:34.634
I can't-- I had to give
all my money to Louie.

14:34.701 --> 14:35.801
To Louie?

14:35.868 --> 14:37.968
Hey, let me have
a couple of beers.

14:38.033 --> 14:39.467
How come? What for?

14:39.534 --> 14:40.801
Never mind, it's
a long story.

14:40.868 --> 14:44.100
Hey, I got something I
got ask you-- a problem.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.667
What do you call
one of them questions

14:45.734 --> 14:46.834
that didn't happen

14:46.901 --> 14:48.167
but you ask it
like it really did?

14:48.234 --> 14:49.734
Hypothetical?

14:49.801 --> 14:51.167
Right-- hypothetical.

14:51.234 --> 14:53.133
Okay, let's say
you're dating a girl,

14:53.200 --> 14:54.701
and you really like her,

14:54.767 --> 14:56.467
and she makes
a pass at me.

14:56.534 --> 14:58.467
Would you want
me to tell you?

14:58.534 --> 15:02.400
How come
you're asking me that?

15:02.467 --> 15:03.534
It's just hypothetical.

15:03.601 --> 15:05.300
What are you getting
so weird about?

15:05.367 --> 15:06.767
Well, it's kind
of a strange question

15:06.834 --> 15:08.767
to come out of the clear
blue sky, Tony, you know?

15:08.834 --> 15:10.167
Bobby, I'm just
asking you...

15:10.234 --> 15:12.100
I know why you're asking me.
It's Debbie, isn't it? Huh?

15:12.167 --> 15:14.167
Well, she's pulled that
little trick once too often.

15:14.234 --> 15:15.601
I'm going to tell her
we're through.

15:15.667 --> 15:18.868
Thanks a lot, Tony.
I owe you one.

15:18.934 --> 15:20.834
ELAINE:
Bobby, is Tony in there?

15:20.901 --> 15:22.033
BOBBY:
Yeah, he's inside.

15:23.067 --> 15:25.300
Tony...

15:25.367 --> 15:26.634
Did Kirk stop
by the garage

15:26.701 --> 15:27.801
after I left tonight?

15:27.868 --> 15:28.968
Kirk?
Yeah.

15:29.033 --> 15:30.634
No, I didn't see
any Kirk. No Kirk.

15:30.701 --> 15:31.801
No, I didn't see Kirk.
No?

15:31.868 --> 15:33.133
What gave you that idea?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.467
Oh, Alex said he
thought he saw him

15:34.534 --> 15:35.634
as he was driving off.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.567
Well, I sure didn't
see any Kirk.

15:37.634 --> 15:39.667
Hmm...

15:39.734 --> 15:41.267
Are you okay?

15:41.334 --> 15:43.534
I'm fine. I just have
something on my mind.

15:43.601 --> 15:45.767
Aw, you want to talk about it?

15:45.834 --> 15:48.367
I haven't decided yet.

15:48.434 --> 15:50.267
Mm... well, okay.

15:50.334 --> 15:52.767
Well, I'm going to be home
if you want to call, okay?

15:52.834 --> 15:54.100
Thanks, Elaine.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.133
Okay. I got
to go. Bye.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.167
Hello, Tony.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.767
Hello?

16:04.834 --> 16:06.267
What's the matter?

16:06.334 --> 16:08.968
You're too sad to talk?

16:09.033 --> 16:11.534
Okay, I do your part
for you then.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.434
Hello, Tony.

16:13.501 --> 16:16.434
( <i>imitates Tony</i> ):
Hello, Latka.
How you doing there?

16:18.167 --> 16:19.434
Fine. How are you?

16:19.501 --> 16:21.968
Hey, I'm okay.
How you doing? I'm all right.

16:22.033 --> 16:24.400
Why don't you sit down,
have a seat there.

16:24.467 --> 16:27.133
Well, I'd like to,
but I don't have any money.

16:27.200 --> 16:29.501
That's all right.
You're my pal.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.467
Pals don't need no money.

16:31.534 --> 16:32.834
Have one on me.

16:32.901 --> 16:35.267
All right. Thank you very much.
You're very nice.

16:37.300 --> 16:38.501
Hello?

16:38.567 --> 16:41.534
What's the matter,
you have the blues?

16:44.901 --> 16:47.033
Well, why don't you order
some drinks,

16:47.100 --> 16:48.601
and we can talk about it.

16:48.667 --> 16:50.467
I can't. I got no money.

16:50.534 --> 16:54.100
And, anyway, I don't think
you'd understand my problem.

16:54.167 --> 16:55.767
Yes, I would.

16:55.834 --> 16:57.167
I don't think so.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.968
You know anything
about bisexuals?

17:00.033 --> 17:03.367
Of course. They are
very popular in my country.

17:03.434 --> 17:04.934
They are?

17:05.000 --> 17:08.501
Yeah. Oh, almost
everybody have them.

17:08.567 --> 17:13.467
And, uh, one of our
favorite sports is racing them.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.867
And when we are not...

17:15.934 --> 17:18.000
when we are not using them,

17:18.067 --> 17:22.367
we have special racks
where we chain them up at night.

17:22.434 --> 17:25.767
Latka, I'm not talking
about bicycles.

17:25.834 --> 17:28.367
I'm talking about bisexuals.

17:28.434 --> 17:29.601
So am I.

17:29.667 --> 17:31.000
Listen, I hope

17:31.067 --> 17:33.067
that you feel better,
all right?

17:33.133 --> 17:34.968
Good-bye.
Take it easy.

17:36.868 --> 17:37.801
Hi, Latka.

17:37.868 --> 17:38.801
Hello, Alex.

17:38.868 --> 17:39.801
Hi, Tony.

17:39.868 --> 17:40.801
Hi, Alex.

17:40.868 --> 17:42.968
Can I have a beer,
Charlie?

17:43.033 --> 17:44.467
Hey, Alex, uh...

17:44.534 --> 17:45.701
Yeah?

17:45.767 --> 17:48.367
I really tried
to work this out myself

17:48.434 --> 17:49.667
but, uh...

17:49.734 --> 17:52.467
I got the worst problem
of my whole life, Alex.

17:52.534 --> 17:53.968
Now, hold it, hold it.
Hold it right there.

17:54.033 --> 17:55.100
Just hold it right there.

17:55.167 --> 17:56.434
I've decided
I'm not going to listen

17:56.501 --> 17:57.467
to any more sentences
that start like that.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.868
Now, wait...
No, I'm serious.

17:58.934 --> 18:00.133
There are a lot of sentences
that I will listen to--

18:00.200 --> 18:01.367
I mean, ones that start with,

18:01.434 --> 18:02.567
"Alex, I'd like
to pass on a compliment."

18:02.634 --> 18:03.968
"Alex,
I've got a woman for you."

18:04.033 --> 18:05.434
"Alex,
I want to give you money."

18:05.501 --> 18:07.100
Those are sentences
I will listen to.

18:07.167 --> 18:08.767
But, "Alex, I've got
the worst problem of my life"

18:08.834 --> 18:10.367
is right up there with,
"Alex, is that thing

18:10.434 --> 18:11.601
on your neck
getting any bigger?"

18:11.667 --> 18:13.067
I don't want to hear that.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.934
No, I'm through
listening to them.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.434
I'm through solving
other people's problems.

18:16.501 --> 18:17.767
I'm no longer
in that line of work.

18:17.834 --> 18:18.934
The office is closed.

18:19.000 --> 18:19.934
The doctor is out.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.434
Sally doesn't live here anymore.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.501
You finished?

18:25.567 --> 18:27.501
Yes. What's your problem?

18:27.567 --> 18:28.934
Oh...

18:29.000 --> 18:31.701
Oh, Alex, I really did try
to spare you from this,

18:31.767 --> 18:33.100
but, uh, I'm not so sure

18:33.167 --> 18:34.601
the guy that Elaine's
going out with

18:34.667 --> 18:35.767
is right for her.

18:35.834 --> 18:38.801
That's your problem?

18:38.868 --> 18:41.467
Tony, Tony, what are
you worried about?

18:41.534 --> 18:43.167
We picked a winner.

18:43.234 --> 18:44.601
ALEX:
That's your problem?

18:44.667 --> 18:46.300
Besides,
who are we to decide

18:46.367 --> 18:48.234
who's right
or wrong for Elaine?

18:48.300 --> 18:50.467
Yeah, that's right,
except for one thing.

18:50.534 --> 18:51.534
Nothing.

18:51.601 --> 18:52.634
Well, except
this one thing.

18:52.701 --> 18:53.801
What one thing?

18:53.868 --> 18:55.434
He wants to date me.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.601
No...

18:57.667 --> 18:59.701
Yeah...

18:59.767 --> 19:03.133
No. You must have misinterpreted
what he meant.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.400
Well, he said
my simplicity was engaging,

19:05.467 --> 19:07.734
and that
we'd be wonderful together.

19:07.801 --> 19:11.234
Oh, no.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.901
See, now, the point
is, here, Alex,

19:12.968 --> 19:14.434
is this could go
rough on Elaine.

19:14.501 --> 19:16.100
If she's getting
serious about him,

19:16.167 --> 19:17.434
she should know.

19:17.501 --> 19:19.133
So should I tell her?

19:19.200 --> 19:21.601
No. I say he ought to tell her.

19:21.667 --> 19:23.601
Someone's got to talk to Kirk
and set him straight,

19:23.667 --> 19:25.501
as it were.

19:26.534 --> 19:27.767
Thanks, Alex.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.501
Let me know how it turns out.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.067
No! No! No!
I'm not going to do it.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.000
For once in my life,
I am not going to let

19:34.067 --> 19:35.467
this thing
get dumped in my lap.

19:35.534 --> 19:37.133
You tell him.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.601
All right, I know it's my job.

19:41.667 --> 19:43.000
But you think you could
come along with me?

19:43.067 --> 19:44.367
I mean, you don't
have to say nothing.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.767
All you got to do is
sit there and be a buddy.

19:45.834 --> 19:47.133
Come on, Alex. Please,
please, please, please.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.567
All right, all right.

19:48.634 --> 19:49.901
I don't understand.

19:49.968 --> 19:52.234
Why can't you do this
by yourself?

19:52.300 --> 19:53.968
I can't be alone with him.

19:54.033 --> 19:57.300
I'm the one he spends
tortured nights
dreaming about.

19:57.367 --> 19:58.300
He said that?

19:58.367 --> 20:00.367
No. I'm just assuming.

20:07.534 --> 20:08.634
KIRK:
Alex.

20:08.701 --> 20:09.634
Oh, hi, Kirk.

20:09.701 --> 20:10.634
Hello.
Hi.

20:10.701 --> 20:11.634
How you doing?

20:11.701 --> 20:12.934
Is Tony here yet?

20:13.000 --> 20:15.367
No. He called and said
he'd be delayed.

20:15.434 --> 20:16.701
Oh.

20:16.767 --> 20:18.367
That gives us
a chance to chat.

20:18.434 --> 20:19.868
Yeah, sure, okay.

20:22.467 --> 20:24.234
This is a gay bar,
isn't it?

20:24.300 --> 20:25.434
Yeah, sure.

20:25.501 --> 20:26.834
This your first time here?

20:26.901 --> 20:28.200
Oh, yes, yes.

20:28.267 --> 20:31.300
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
by saying "yes" so quickly

20:31.367 --> 20:33.734
that it'd be terrible
if I'd been here before,

20:33.801 --> 20:35.767
because, well, actually, it
would not have been terrible

20:35.834 --> 20:37.267
if I'd been here before.

20:37.334 --> 20:38.901
You know, I've been meaning to.

20:40.133 --> 20:42.234
Just out of curiosity,
of course.

20:42.300 --> 20:44.367
I don't mean you're
a curiosity, but I, I mean....

20:44.434 --> 20:46.100
Let's not chat anymore.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.000
I used to be such a
good chatter, you know.

20:48.067 --> 20:51.167
Look, uh, Kirk, I...
I have a really terrible...

20:51.234 --> 20:53.200
uh, difficult thing
to talk to you about,

20:53.267 --> 20:54.734
and I don't even
know how to start.

20:54.801 --> 20:58.267
Alex, I think I can guess
what you're trying to tell me.

20:58.334 --> 20:59.667
You can?

20:59.734 --> 21:01.033
But I've already told
Elaine that I'm bisexual.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.234
Shh.

21:02.300 --> 21:05.167
Oh, okay. It's okay here.

21:05.234 --> 21:06.167
I'm sorry.

21:06.234 --> 21:07.434
Anyway,

21:07.501 --> 21:10.467
we're still friends,
and we had a fine talk.

21:10.534 --> 21:12.267
Oh, and by the way,

21:12.334 --> 21:14.567
I understand
that Tony's not interested

21:14.634 --> 21:16.067
and that's okay, too.

21:16.133 --> 21:19.367
Oh... wow.

21:19.434 --> 21:21.100
Can we have a couple of beers?

21:21.167 --> 21:24.200
Sure. Hey, Chief, can we
get a couple of beers?

21:24.267 --> 21:26.534
Well, I thought this was
going to be difficult,

21:26.601 --> 21:27.968
but instead,
it's a snap.

21:28.033 --> 21:29.467
Boy, am I
a lucky guy.

21:29.534 --> 21:31.868
Excuse me.
Would you like to dance?

21:35.400 --> 21:38.701
Just for the sake of optimism,
no, go ahead, I don't mind.

21:38.767 --> 21:40.200
No, I meant you.

21:40.267 --> 21:42.868
Oh, no, no. I'm just having
a beer with a pal. Thanks.

21:42.934 --> 21:43.868
Come on,
don't be shy.

21:43.934 --> 21:46.167
No, no, no, no,
I really can't.

21:46.234 --> 21:48.801
( <i>dance music playing</i> )

21:51.701 --> 21:53.200
It's okay with me.

21:58.601 --> 22:00.534
Whoa.

22:00.601 --> 22:03.534

22:08.167 --> 22:10.000
( <i>muttering</i> )

22:17.801 --> 22:19.300
Oh, good step.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.667
Duck!
What?

22:29.834 --> 22:31.767
Thanks, pal.
Thank you very much.

22:31.834 --> 22:33.501
Yeah, one, two, three, ha!

22:33.567 --> 22:35.167
One, two, three, go!

22:35.234 --> 22:37.234
One, two, three, step!

22:37.300 --> 22:39.100
One, two, three, dance!

22:39.167 --> 22:41.100
One, two, three, dance!

23:30.767 --> 23:33.067
Alex, Elaine's heart
is getting broken.

23:33.133 --> 23:34.701
You're having
a great time here dancing.

23:43.501 --> 23:44.868
I'll never understand

23:44.934 --> 23:46.434
how you could
have let that happen.

23:46.501 --> 23:47.734
I don't care what you say.

23:47.801 --> 23:49.033
I would never
dance with that guy.

23:49.100 --> 23:53.300
No, not you,
you little heartbreaker.

23:53.367 --> 23:54.334
Give me my trophy.

Hi, guys.

Hiya, Jim.

24:03.367 --> 24:05.234
Hey, Jim,
what do you say?

24:07.234 --> 24:09.701
Hey, Alex, what's that for?

24:09.767 --> 24:12.033
For acting like a jerk.

24:12.100 --> 24:17.167
Why doesn't anybody ever
tell me about these contests?

24:25.100 --> 24:28.534

Night, Mr. Walters.
