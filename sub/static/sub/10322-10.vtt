Me and Randy were about to take
our very first airplane ride.

00:05.206 --> 00:10.344
Since we aren't big travelers,
we weren't sure what to pack,
so we packed everything.

We weren't goin'
on vacation though.

on a winnin' streak, gamblin'.

- Yeah, buddy!

00:24.458 --> 00:26.494
I just couldn't lose.
You can't lose, Earl.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.662
But I got so caught up
in gamblin',

00:28.696 --> 00:31.432
I forced Catalina
to drive without a license
and get pulled over.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.502
She was too worried
about her boobs escapin'
to make an escape of her own--

00:34.535 --> 00:36.570
Let go of me!
and she was deported.

And because of me, Randy
lost his chance...

00:45.346 --> 00:47.581
to finally tell Catalina
how he felt about her.

00:50.518 --> 00:54.822
You think Catalina's
been robbed, or murdered,
or gone out on a date?

00:54.855 --> 00:57.391
Any of those would be
my worst nightmare.

I guess I hope she gets robbed.

We'll keep our fingers
crossed, Randy,
but I wouldn't worry.

a proper suitcase.

those pills back when you
were married to her.

Me too. All she ever took
back then was cough syrup
