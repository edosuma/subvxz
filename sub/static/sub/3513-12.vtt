WEBVTT

00:12.345 --> 00:13.881
Mmm!

00:19.652 --> 00:20.722
Ah!

00:37.504 --> 00:39.575
Maybe Ruby found another raccoon.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.516
Well, I just hope it's not a skunk.

00:41.574 --> 00:43.485
Because we don't have
any tomato juice.

00:43.543 --> 00:45.045
It's not the tomato
juice I'm worried about.

00:45.111 --> 00:47.352
It's who's going to pick her
up and put her in the bathtub.

00:47.614 --> 00:50.185
Well, I can tell you who
it's not going to be.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.593
Good luck.

00:52.085 --> 00:54.065
You know the great thing
about being married?

00:54.120 --> 00:55.497
I never have to make a decision.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.032
Oh, God, now what?

01:05.598 --> 01:08.511
Ruby? Come here!

01:16.209 --> 01:17.347
Ruby?

01:21.347 --> 01:23.452
There you are. What's wrong?

01:23.817 --> 01:25.660
What are you doing? Come on.

01:32.692 --> 01:33.727
Ed!

01:34.861 --> 01:36.807
Are you all right?

01:48.675 --> 01:50.211
Dimitri!

02:49.169 --> 02:52.446
Morning, fellows.
This is Ed and Lois Weller.

02:52.939 --> 02:54.213
Married 26 years.

02:54.641 --> 02:57.178
Ed here is a lumber exec.
Recently took early retirement.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.587
Probably not what
he had planned, huh?

02:59.646 --> 03:02.354
We got lots of prints.
Techs even found one partial in blood.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.119
Somebody was feeling ambitious.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.164
That's not like a knife wound.

03:06.219 --> 03:07.596
It's more like he was ripped open.

03:07.654 --> 03:11.192
Too savage for a B and E.
Something else was going on here.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.463
Drugs, maybe?

03:15.828 --> 03:19.366
Well, the steak's raw.
It looks like someone was gnawing on it.

03:23.536 --> 03:25.243
Animal could have
gotten in here after.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.340
Door was open.

03:26.406 --> 03:28.113
Why would it leave
the steak behind?

03:31.878 --> 03:33.255
A lot of horse tracks.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.224
It's not that unusual out here.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.760
Lots of people have horses.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.189
Except these people don't.

03:42.989 --> 03:44.662
Let's see where they go.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.779
Hooves are everywhere.

03:57.270 --> 03:59.876
Hey. Look at the
path of these tracks.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.845
Well, it came in one way,

04:04.077 --> 04:05.181
then doubled back.

04:05.245 --> 04:08.089
A lot of hoof prints here,
and these drag marks next to them.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.285
Dragging what, a rake?

04:09.482 --> 04:11.928
Or something clawing at the ground.

04:22.895 --> 04:24.203
Could be something off a saddle?

04:25.331 --> 04:27.436
You're asking the wrong guy.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.044
No barns, no horses.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.448
What were these horses
doing on private property?

04:41.414 --> 04:43.087
What do you think?

04:43.349 --> 04:44.919
Medieval.

04:46.686 --> 04:48.029
Hey. What's up?

04:48.087 --> 04:50.328
Some very exciting laundry.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.963
No wonder you called.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.333
Actually, I'm going
to the grocery store,

04:53.393 --> 04:55.669
so I wanted to check in with you
about our anniversary dinner.

04:57.196 --> 04:58.436
You do remember that, right?

04:58.498 --> 05:00.808
Dinner? When have I
ever forgotten dinner?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.479
Okay. So, you're saying

05:02.535 --> 05:04.014
you want peanut butter
and jelly tomorrow night?

05:04.070 --> 05:06.141
No. I'm saying that
my time with you

05:06.205 --> 05:08.242
has been the best three
years of my life.

05:08.308 --> 05:09.480
And I wouldn't change a second.

05:10.343 --> 05:12.380
And flank steak sounds great.

05:12.712 --> 05:14.123
Okay. Anything else?

05:14.414 --> 05:16.360
Huh? No,just you.

05:16.549 --> 05:19.359
Do you want me with green
beans or asparagus?

05:19.886 --> 05:21.388
Just butter.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.793
Well, I love you, I think.

05:24.057 --> 05:25.468
I love you, too.

06:07.300 --> 06:09.837
We got a hit on one of the
bloody prints from the cabin.

06:09.902 --> 06:13.611
Dimitri Skontos. Three priors
for misdemeanor possession.

06:13.673 --> 06:16.051
Served one year off a cocaine rap.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.747
Released on probation last month.

06:18.344 --> 06:19.789
Nothing more violent
than possession?

06:19.846 --> 06:21.985
Drugs are a slippery slope,
in case you didn't know that.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.353
Yeah, I've heard rumors.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.952
Well, I've got registration
on Dimitri's car.

06:26.018 --> 06:27.520
Put out an APB. What have you got?

06:27.854 --> 06:30.300
His parole officer. Leo Taymor.

06:30.623 --> 06:33.001
He's waiting for us at
his office. Let's go.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.100
So, what did he do?

06:35.261 --> 06:36.899
We've placed him at a murder.

06:37.096 --> 06:39.098
Oh, hell. I didn't expect that.

06:39.632 --> 06:40.804
Share any details?

06:40.933 --> 06:44.471
Couple out in Forest Grove.
He broke into the house and murdered them.

06:45.738 --> 06:48.651
Wait a minute. You sure
you got the right guy?

06:48.708 --> 06:49.914
That doesn't sound like Dimitri.

06:50.643 --> 06:53.214
Well, we've got his bloody
fingerprints at the scene of the crime.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.692
Damn.

06:55.982 --> 07:00.055
Look. From what I know about the guy,
he didn't go into prison bad.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.998
And I know this will
come as a shock to you,

07:03.055 --> 07:05.831
time behind bars doesn't always
change a man for the better.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.971
He was having a hard
time on the outside.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.199
So how did he get paroled?

07:10.129 --> 07:12.166
That's not my job.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.144
When was the last time
Dimitri checked in with you?

07:16.502 --> 07:20.712
Oh. Um... You know,
actually, he was...

07:23.910 --> 07:27.915
A no show this week.
And I didn't violate him.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.555
I figured I'd cut him some slack.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.195
Maybe that was a mistake.

07:34.554 --> 07:36.625
Huh. So, does Dimitri have a job?

07:37.356 --> 07:41.463
Um, yeah. He, uh... He works for his
uncle over at the boxing gym on Eighth.

07:42.528 --> 07:43.666
I know it.

07:44.931 --> 07:48.674
You know, it's too bad. Dimitri was
hoping to be the next Sugar Ray.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.757
Stick and move. Come on.
Stay on the balls of your feet.

08:01.380 --> 08:02.791
All right. Stay at it.

08:03.449 --> 08:05.122
Gus Pappas? Yeah.

08:05.785 --> 08:08.163
We understand your nephew,
Dimitri Skontos works here.

08:08.221 --> 08:09.723
Yeah, that's my sister's kid.

08:09.789 --> 08:10.927
Well, we need to talk to him.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.570
Why? A married couple
was murdered last night.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.001
There's no way Dimitri could
have anything to do with that.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.736
Well, there's evidence
that puts him at the scene.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.745
So if you know anything,
sir, you should tell us.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.272
Well, I haven't seen or heard
from him in a couple of weeks.

08:25.104 --> 08:26.242
And that doesn't worry you?

08:26.305 --> 08:28.251
Yeah, it worries me.
But he's a grown man.

08:28.307 --> 08:29.445
He can take care of himself.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.544
What about his mother?

08:30.610 --> 08:32.749
She died about four years ago.

08:32.812 --> 08:34.655
Now I'm the only
family Dimitri has.

08:34.714 --> 08:36.250
Look, he's a good kid.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.261
He did some drugs awhile back,
but he's straightened out.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.490
He couldn't kill anybody.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.190
Anybody else in here know him?

08:42.255 --> 08:46.169
Well, most of the guys do. Uh... You know,
Bryan there probably knows him best.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.205
Would you happen to have any
recent photos of Dimitri?

08:48.261 --> 08:50.366
Oh, yeah. Up in my office.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.113
Looking good.

09:02.174 --> 09:03.676
What the hell?

09:04.277 --> 09:05.585
Yeah, I have that
effect on some people.

09:07.446 --> 09:09.824
Really? You don't
have to go there now.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.154
I'm here for another reason.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.158
I think I can take you.
Listen to me.

09:13.219 --> 09:15.529
I've got a double murder.
I want you to answer some questions.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.898
So you can either answer them or,
you know...

09:17.957 --> 09:21.097
I can let you cool off in
jail for a couple of days.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.035
Sorry. Okay?

09:23.095 --> 09:24.870
I just got a little worked up
when I saw you. That's all.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.340
All right.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.910
So, where can I find
Dimitri Skontos?

09:29.569 --> 09:32.607
I don't know. Last time I saw
him was a couple of weeks ago.

09:32.805 --> 09:35.615
He came in, we worked out,
then he went for a run.

09:35.675 --> 09:37.746
This photo was taken last month.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.824
Yeah. Yeah, we threw a party
for Dimitri getting paroled.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.288
Where do you guys run?

09:43.349 --> 09:44.453
Forest Park.

09:44.517 --> 09:45.962
All the guys here run there.

09:46.018 --> 09:47.395
Where? I'll show you.

09:47.787 --> 09:50.961
I'm getting ready to go for a run now.
You two can follow me.

09:51.023 --> 09:53.025
That is, if you can keep up.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.068
Oh, to be young.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.849
Now, this is a good place to run.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.825
It's cool up here.
The air is clean.

10:15.881 --> 10:17.724
Not too many people around,
so you can clear your head.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.421
And what's your usual route?

10:19.485 --> 10:21.988
You're looking at it.
I usually do about 10 miles,

10:22.188 --> 10:24.896
a couple of hours' worth.
Up and around Trapper's Peak.

10:25.958 --> 10:27.198
Why? You coming?

10:27.326 --> 10:28.896
Have fun.

10:29.595 --> 10:30.938
All right.

10:39.538 --> 10:41.711
So how long do you think it
would take us to do 10 miles?

10:41.774 --> 10:43.617
Depends on how fast we drive.

10:44.110 --> 10:46.215
The murder site is only
six miles from here.

10:46.278 --> 10:47.916
And that's significant why?

10:48.180 --> 10:51.491
Well, he could have come from
here to commit the murders.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.055
That's horse manure.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.394
Hey, it's as good a
theory as we have.

10:55.621 --> 10:57.658
No. Over there.

10:59.625 --> 11:01.229
More horses.

11:05.531 --> 11:07.875
Well, it's not exactly evidence
I want to present in court.

11:07.933 --> 11:12.143
Griffin. Yeah. The address?

11:14.206 --> 11:16.243
Yeah, I know where it is. Thanks.

11:17.443 --> 11:20.356
Patrol found Dimitri's car near
an abandoned warehouse in Linnton.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.916
They're sitting on it
until we get there.

11:50.142 --> 11:51.621
Welcome to paradise.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.520
You always take us
to the best places.

11:54.113 --> 11:57.219
Okay. So, we've got an
abandoned '91 Acura,

11:57.283 --> 11:59.263
registered to one Dimitri Skontos.

11:59.318 --> 12:01.491
Gone over by the local scavengers.
There's not much left.

12:01.754 --> 12:05.292
Engine's gone, tires are gone,
radio's gone, seats are gone.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.269
They left some beer
bottles in the back.

12:07.827 --> 12:08.931
Empty-

12:09.095 --> 12:11.166
And they took the steering wheel.

12:11.363 --> 12:12.808
No bodies or blood? Negative.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.908
Better have it gone over,
just for old times' sake.

12:15.034 --> 12:16.672
Just waiting for you to
give it your blessing, sir.

12:22.007 --> 12:23.384
That guy's checking us out.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.148
Where?

12:25.211 --> 12:27.623
Building. He just went back inside.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.651
If he was here last night,
he might have seen something.

12:30.716 --> 12:34.129
It's worth asking. We're not going
to get anything from Dimitri's car.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.065
Okay. Where did he go?

12:38.290 --> 12:40.065
Oh, we've got some blood here.

12:45.931 --> 12:48.207
Hey! Police! Anybody here?

12:49.802 --> 12:51.748
Well, there was someone here.
I saw him.

12:51.804 --> 12:55.616
There's more blood. Hey, call forensics.
We'll keep looking.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.792
Oh, man.

13:03.649 --> 13:07.563
A whole mess of blood
and weird-ass symbols.

13:12.491 --> 13:14.368
The lettering looks Latin.

13:14.426 --> 13:16.667
Looks like some kind of arena.

13:18.998 --> 13:21.774
Yeah. For something bloody.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.576
Cockfights?

13:25.371 --> 13:27.214
That would be some
pretty big chickens.

13:28.707 --> 13:31.051
Yeah, and wearing some big shoes.

13:32.812 --> 13:35.349
Or maybe some kind of
bare knuckle fighting.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.223
That's a lot of blood for
bare knuckle fighting.

13:37.283 --> 13:40.196
Maybe they're using
more than their fists.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.803
You have any idea what
these symbols are?

13:49.228 --> 13:52.437
It's not any taggers or
gang signs I've ever seen.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.358
Part of a morning star.

14:14.086 --> 14:15.565
Medieval weapon.

14:17.056 --> 14:18.933
There's some pretty sick
stuff going on in here.

14:19.358 --> 14:22.100
Looks like the strap we
found outside the house.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.232
Hey, guys, over here! He's running!

14:29.935 --> 14:32.108
I caught him.
For about two seconds.

14:32.171 --> 14:34.811
What happened to you?
He had something in his hand.

14:35.741 --> 14:37.015
I don't know what it was,
but it hurt.

14:37.076 --> 14:38.350
We better get you
checked out. Come on.

14:38.410 --> 14:40.151
That son of a bitch is fast.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.886
I'm okay.

15:07.673 --> 15:11.485
Crossbows. Morning stars. Whips.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.021
Good God.

15:16.348 --> 15:18.589
So, we're dealing with some
kind of combat fighting.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.221
Like a gladiator fight club.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.164
And who signs up for that?

15:22.221 --> 15:24.223
Friends, Romans and countrymen.

15:24.290 --> 15:25.792
So, how does Dimitri's car end up

15:25.858 --> 15:27.769
down by an abandoned
warehouse in Linnton?

15:27.826 --> 15:30.136
He's a boxer. We found
evidence of a fight.

15:30.195 --> 15:32.539
So how does Dimitri end up in the woods,
killing two people?

15:32.598 --> 15:34.134
And who in the hell speaks Latin?

15:47.212 --> 15:49.556
"Man's first happiness
is to know how to die.

15:50.282 --> 15:53.092
"His second is to
be forced to die."

15:57.790 --> 16:00.066
I took a bit of Latin
back in high school.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.968
I thought I was going
to be a doctor.

16:02.561 --> 16:03.904
So who the hell are these people?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.136
We don't know. We found a leather
strap at the murder site,

16:06.198 --> 16:08.041
and a similar piece of
leather at the warehouse

16:08.133 --> 16:09.271
where we believe a fight was held.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.440
It looks like they're
using ancient weapons.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.780
And based on the amount of blood,
I'd say it's pretty brutal.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.218
We just got a lab report back which
matches blood found on the strap

16:17.276 --> 16:18.584
with blood found at the fight.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.648
That's Dimitri Skontos' blood,
our prime suspect in the murders.

16:21.847 --> 16:23.383
Do we know how this
all ties together yet?

16:23.449 --> 16:25.360
Not until we find out who
is behind this fight.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.087
All right. Now,
our best lead is tracking down

16:27.152 --> 16:29.063
whoever owns that warehouse.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.161
Good.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.248
What the hell is your problem?

16:49.408 --> 16:53.083
You're my problem. Your little
blood sport has gotten out of hand.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.953
We had one escape. We caught him.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.289
After he murdered two people.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.187
Not a perfect world.

16:59.451 --> 17:00.862
You screwed up.

17:00.919 --> 17:03.627
You know what happens when
they get a taste of it.

17:05.457 --> 17:09.030
We had an agreement.
I gave you a list.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.538
There were specific names on it.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.133
You were not to deviate from it.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.775
Dimitri Skontos was
not on that list.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.272
He was on my list.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.076
You have no list.
There is only my list,

17:22.141 --> 17:25.247
in my canton, under my conditions.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.989
Gangbangers and meth addicts
don't make good fighters.

17:30.249 --> 17:31.557
They don't even know how to die.

17:31.617 --> 17:33.062
Where is the sport in that?

17:33.419 --> 17:35.524
So you decided to pick
one of your ex-cons

17:35.587 --> 17:37.999
out on parole with
family in this city.

17:38.190 --> 17:41.763
He's exceptional.
He's won six straight fights.

17:41.827 --> 17:43.670
He loves the taste of blood.

17:44.930 --> 17:47.001
The purse is the
largest it's ever been.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.307
You'll get your tribute I
don't care about the money.

17:49.368 --> 17:50.847
Shut it down.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.483
Before your greed and
stupidity ruin us both.

17:54.540 --> 17:57.180
I don't know if it's
your call anymore.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.914
There's too much money involved.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.450
Times have changed, Your Highness.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.028
Royalty ain't what it used to be.

18:08.587 --> 18:12.296
You're right. In the old days,
I would have had you drawn and quartered.

18:12.357 --> 18:15.395
Now, clean up this mess.
Or I'll clean it up for you.

18:16.962 --> 18:20.569
You and I are in this together,
whether you like it or not,

18:21.033 --> 18:23.912
so I'd be more careful
on how you treat me.

19:18.857 --> 19:20.598
Nick, it's me.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.534
No, no, no. It's cool.
I took care of it, man.

19:27.599 --> 19:30.307
I did what you said.
I went around my block three times.

19:30.369 --> 19:32.906
Once through the park, down through
the northeast, I took one trolley,

19:32.971 --> 19:35.042
and another one, you know,
back to my car. Okay. I get it.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.381
I get it. Thank you for coming.

19:36.441 --> 19:38.284
No. Dude, thank you.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.482
I mean, I know what you must have gone
through to confide in me about this,

19:41.547 --> 19:44.551
and then to let me in
here by myself. I mean...

19:44.616 --> 19:47.290
Actually, I guess it took a Siegbarste
beating the crap out of you.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.730
But, dude, this place is like...

19:50.622 --> 19:52.829
The National Archives.

19:52.891 --> 19:56.304
Or the freaking
Smithsonian of Grimmology.

19:56.361 --> 20:00.400
I mean, just the sheer historical
value of everything in here is...

20:02.634 --> 20:06.207
Really. Nothing I would ever
share with anyone else, ever.

20:07.573 --> 20:08.608
So.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.615
What do you need from me?

20:10.676 --> 20:12.121
What do you know about Lowen?

20:12.311 --> 20:15.315
Ah. Well, I know they'll rip
your face off and then eat it.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.552
I know that.

20:17.015 --> 20:20.588
Yeah, well, what about,
uh... Combat fighting?

20:21.220 --> 20:23.632
Oh, you're talking
about gladiator Lowen.

20:23.855 --> 20:25.300
They are fierce.

20:25.457 --> 20:28.597
They're fueled by
generations of bitterness.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.807
You know? Just imagine, one day,
you're king of your own jungle, right,

20:31.863 --> 20:33.137
minding your own business,

20:33.198 --> 20:37.408
and suddenly, you're in a net, being dragged
off to Rome and thrown in a gladiator pit.

20:37.469 --> 20:39.039
Could these fights
be happening today?

20:39.171 --> 20:41.777
Oh... I don't know. I mean...

20:43.976 --> 20:46.081
Fighting for sport
isn't unique to Wesen.

20:46.211 --> 20:49.784
If there's money in it, I'm sure they could
be pulling that gladiator crap today.

20:49.848 --> 20:53.455
Okay, what... What if a Lowen

20:54.886 --> 20:57.594
was capturing other Wesen
and forcing them to fight?

20:59.157 --> 21:03.333
Look. A hundred years ago, there was always
a Wesen disappearing from some hamlet.

21:03.395 --> 21:05.807
You know? But nowadays,
I don't know...

21:05.864 --> 21:08.401
If these fights
were happening today

21:08.600 --> 21:09.908
how could I find out
more about them?

21:09.968 --> 21:12.414
I don't know, man.
Lowen keep to themselves.

21:12.671 --> 21:14.344
The pride mentality.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.486
But I do know a guy
who knows a guy who's

21:18.277 --> 21:21.383
like, marginally into the
fight thing. I could...

21:22.080 --> 21:23.184
Wow!

21:23.715 --> 21:26.628
Can you imagine getting
hit with one of these?

21:27.419 --> 21:28.955
That's got to be a bell ringer.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.148
Die!

21:58.717 --> 22:00.128
MAN IN CROWD: Finish him, come on!

22:32.117 --> 22:33.425
Sauly here?

22:34.986 --> 22:37.091
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

22:37.155 --> 22:40.261
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Seven to four.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.998
Yeah. Yeah, okay. You're covered.

22:42.060 --> 22:44.597
MAN ON PHONE: You know I'm good
for it AH right, beautiful.

22:44.663 --> 22:45.937
You Sauly?

22:46.164 --> 22:48.166
I'm on the phone.

22:50.235 --> 22:52.647
A buddy of mine says you
can find me some action.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.240
Don't know what
you're talking about.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.751
Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Sorry. I'm back.

22:56.007 --> 22:58.715
All right, good. Just make sure
you take care of that last one.

23:02.881 --> 23:06.021
All right, all right. Look.
I've got, uh... Pigskin, hoops.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.591
Got a line on a greyhound.
Five to three.

23:09.654 --> 23:11.725
100% guaranteed return.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.134
For you, on the house. No juice.

23:14.493 --> 23:18.566
I don't bet on dogs.
I'm looking for real competition.

23:20.132 --> 23:22.373
Something with a little more, um...

23:23.268 --> 23:24.679
Life and death to it.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.315
What makes you think I've got
that kind of thing to offer?

23:27.372 --> 23:29.374
Word is you track
the hardcore stuff.

23:35.147 --> 23:36.592
You're talking Lowen games.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.419
I don't cover them.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.260
Bet you know who does.

23:54.699 --> 23:56.906
Be here by 6:00.

23:57.469 --> 24:00.109
Someone will meet you,
give you directions to the fight.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.118
It's tonight. That's all I know.

24:04.042 --> 24:05.112
What about a bet?

24:09.314 --> 24:10.486
They'll take care
of you at ringside.

24:12.651 --> 24:13.823
Of course.

24:27.065 --> 24:29.136
What have you got? MONROE:
I've got a line on a fight.

24:29.201 --> 24:30.839
It's tonight. Where?

24:30.902 --> 24:34.748
I don't know. I'm supposed
to meet some guy at 6:00.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.415
Yeah. And he's going
to tell me where.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.149
As soon as you find out
where the fight is, call me.

24:39.211 --> 24:40.212
I'll take it from there.

24:40.278 --> 24:41.916
You don't want me to go? O

24:42.013 --> 24:43.993
I did a little boxing
in college, you know.

24:44.115 --> 24:46.561
This is way too dangerous.
Just call me, okay?

24:46.651 --> 24:48.688
Okay. No. Fine.
If that's the way you want it.

24:48.887 --> 24:50.798
I've got a line on the
owner of that warehouse.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.693
Died years ago.
The place is in probate.

24:53.792 --> 24:54.930
The city is trying
to get rid of it,

24:54.993 --> 24:56.131
but nobody's taking responsibility.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.099
Abandoned warehouse, nobody around.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.267
The perfect place for a fight.

24:59.397 --> 25:00.467
That's what I'm thinking.

25:00.532 --> 25:03.274
Did you guys interview a Bryan Cooney
in connection with the Weller murders?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.780
Yeah, we talked to him
yesterday at the gym.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.439
He was a friend of Dimitri Skontos.

25:06.605 --> 25:09.142
Well, a missing persons report was
filed on Bryan late last night.

25:09.407 --> 25:10.909
The last place you saw
him was at the gym?

25:10.976 --> 25:12.978
No. Forest Park.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.692
He was going for a run in the last
place Dimitri was known to have gone.

25:16.748 --> 25:21.094
Well, Bryan's car was found abandoned by
that warehouse where the fight was held.

25:21.152 --> 25:22.722
Where we found Dimitri's car.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.661
Bryan and Dimitri both have the
same parole officer, right?

25:25.056 --> 25:26.160
Leo Taymor. Well, we didn't know

25:26.224 --> 25:28.636
Bryan was out on parole,
but we talked to Taymor about Dimitri.

25:28.693 --> 25:29.797
Now, Bryan is missing.

25:30.629 --> 25:32.006
You need to talk to Taymor again.

25:32.063 --> 25:33.406
He might know more
than he's telling us.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.737
Nick can follow up on Bryan's car.
I'll talk to Taymor.

25:35.800 --> 25:37.245
Be careful the way you handle this.

25:37.302 --> 25:40.078
Taymor works for the Department of
Corrections. So my advice to you...

25:40.138 --> 25:42.118
You visit him at home. All right?

25:42.507 --> 25:43.577
Let me know what you find out.

25:51.750 --> 25:53.354
If I'd known they were going
to dump another vehicle,

25:53.418 --> 25:54.795
I would have just
slept here last night.

25:55.353 --> 25:58.027
Same M.O. Both guys went
running in Forest Park.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.864
Both guys wind up missing.

25:59.925 --> 26:03.031
So I guess they just dumped the
cars down here to keep you offtrack.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.129
Yeah, Burkhardt.

26:04.195 --> 26:06.334
Hey, I'm freezing my
tail off out here.

26:07.165 --> 26:09.975
They've got me waiting off the St.
Helene Highway, but nobody's here.

26:10.035 --> 26:11.207
So, what do you want me to do?

26:11.269 --> 26:12.646
St. Helene Highway? Near Linnton?

26:13.204 --> 26:15.184
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Here comes somebody.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.811
Yeah, looks like a truck pulling
some kind of horse trailer.

26:18.009 --> 26:20.512
A horse trailer? Monroe.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.685
You've got to get out
of there right now. Why?

26:22.747 --> 26:25.956
Monroe? Stay with the car.
I've got to go.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.757
Monroe. Monroe?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.143
Put your hands where I can see them!
Get the hell out.

26:46.338 --> 26:48.340
Don't shoot. Don't shoot me.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.912
Where did they take him? Tell me.

26:50.976 --> 26:52.853
Take it easy. I'll tell you.

26:55.213 --> 26:58.456
I was trying to make a bet, man.

26:59.551 --> 27:02.361
You've got the wrong guy.
I am not a fighter.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.032
What the hell?

27:10.261 --> 27:13.834
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no. Guys.

27:13.932 --> 27:16.310
No, no. No, no.

27:20.505 --> 27:22.212
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Guys.

27:22.273 --> 27:26.619
This is never going to work.
I am not the Blutbad you think I am.

27:27.712 --> 27:29.658
We'll find out soon enough.

27:30.582 --> 27:33.062
Think about the fight.
Better get ready. Guys?

27:33.752 --> 27:36.460
Hey, hey, hey. Guys! Guys!

27:44.195 --> 27:46.072
Oh, man, you don't look so good.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.133
Are you one of the fighters?

27:48.366 --> 27:49.845
I mean, that's what's
going on here, right?

27:53.371 --> 27:55.180
What's the problem? You got
something stuck in your hand?

27:55.974 --> 27:59.251
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy,
all right? I've been there.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.387
When life's not treating you so good,
you blame the first guy you see.

28:03.448 --> 28:05.724
But it seems to me we're kind
of in the same boat here.

28:06.217 --> 28:09.391
We should be working together, planning
on how to get the hell out of here.

28:10.922 --> 28:12.560
What is wrong with your hand, dude?

28:14.325 --> 28:15.668
Your hand.

28:15.960 --> 28:17.598
You got something in it or what?

28:18.663 --> 28:20.939
Let me take a look.
Maybe I can help.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.945
I know a little first aid.
Really. Scouts, man.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.215
Let me take a look.

28:27.272 --> 28:29.616
I'm not going to hurt you. Okay.

28:30.742 --> 28:34.952
Oh, buddy, that is nasty No
wonder you're a little touchy.

28:35.747 --> 28:39.285
All right. Now, let me just
see if I can get a hold of it.

28:41.419 --> 28:43.057
Oh, one quick thing This
is probably going to hurt.

28:47.058 --> 28:49.231
No idea how that got in there?

28:49.761 --> 28:50.831
But it's out now.

29:01.673 --> 29:06.452
Um... As appetizing as that might
have looked to me at one time,

29:06.511 --> 29:09.424
I'm... I'm sort of doing a no
meat thing. So, if we could...

29:15.754 --> 29:18.758
Wait a minute. What kind of meat...

29:25.697 --> 29:27.301
...has a tattoo?

29:44.415 --> 29:48.886
Ah! We've wanted a Blutbad for
our games for quite a while.

29:49.254 --> 29:52.394
And thanks to Sauly, we've got one.

29:53.258 --> 29:56.102
Don't thank that
little ferret so fast.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.668
I'm not going to fight.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.334
Oh, you can fight.

30:01.699 --> 30:04.407
Or you can die.
It's entirely up to you.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.513
But you're getting in the ring.

30:06.805 --> 30:07.840
Get him ready.

30:08.206 --> 30:12.712
And, just in case you're thinking about
fighting before you get in the ring?

30:38.469 --> 30:39.812
That's the spirit.

30:42.974 --> 30:46.444
Mr. Taymor. It's Detective Griffin.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.487
Leo Taymor.

31:20.478 --> 31:21.821
Leo Taymor.

32:10.295 --> 32:12.707
Yeah. Where are you? HANK:
In a tack room at Taymor's house.

32:13.932 --> 32:15.843
Found some horses and
a whole lot of weapons

32:15.900 --> 32:17.436
for some nasty hand-to-hand.

32:17.602 --> 32:18.945
- What about Taymor?
- Not here.

32:19.737 --> 32:22.809
Where are you? I'm about three
miles up Jordan Creek Road.

32:23.241 --> 32:25.050
At a barn at the end of the road.

32:25.643 --> 32:27.782
Monroe got a lead
on a fight tonight.

32:27.845 --> 32:29.722
How? Some bookie he knows.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.726
My guess is Taymor is there.

32:32.550 --> 32:34.552
I'm coming to you. Bring backup.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.693
Dimitri!

33:13.224 --> 33:14.828
I wish to hell I
knew what that meant.

33:25.470 --> 33:27.381
Dude. Hang on, man.

33:27.505 --> 33:29.951
I'm the guy who pulled the thing
out of your hand. Remember?

33:30.008 --> 33:31.487
We've got no beef.

33:31.976 --> 33:33.319
Oh, crap!

34:56.293 --> 34:58.103
Fight's over. Let him go.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.269
Leo.

35:02.900 --> 35:05.380
That's an appropriate
name for a Lowen. Monroe?

35:07.405 --> 35:09.009
A Grimm. Unbelievable.

35:09.073 --> 35:10.245
Monroe, get out of there.

35:10.308 --> 35:12.686
He stays. This is a
fight to the death.

35:12.743 --> 35:16.281
Yeah? If it is,
it's going to be your death.

35:16.781 --> 35:21.321
Go ahead. Shoot. Today is a
good day to die with honor...

35:23.387 --> 35:27.335
...amongst my brothers who
won't hesitate to take revenge.

35:29.060 --> 35:35.011
The privilege of leaving the Lowen games
alive belongs only to the champion.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.207
Those are the rules.

35:37.869 --> 35:39.974
One more step, and he dies.

35:42.807 --> 35:44.184
We're both going to die.

35:45.176 --> 35:47.178
But the Blutbad dies first.

35:51.082 --> 35:54.427
Stop. I'll fight in the
Blutbad's place for both of us.

35:54.719 --> 35:56.062
Wait.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.164
You said the privilege of leaving
alive belongs to the champion.

36:02.226 --> 36:03.466
Uh-huh.

36:04.462 --> 36:05.770
We don't allow guns.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.474
And why should l trust you?

36:07.532 --> 36:10.741
You shouldn't. But you don't
really have a choice, do you?

36:13.538 --> 36:17.076
Give me the gun. Get in the ring.
Or the Blutbad dies.

36:23.748 --> 36:26.160
We have a new challenger. Hey.

36:26.217 --> 36:27.321
Get off me.

36:27.385 --> 36:32.266
And this one is going to be
a very special contestant.

36:42.700 --> 36:44.008
Oh, dude.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.960
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.728
But that's not why you're here.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.228
No.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.535
I have an issue with
a fellow parishioner.

37:11.662 --> 37:14.506
He has lost respect.

37:15.032 --> 37:16.909
So, we have one who has strayed.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.703
I'm afraid so.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.577
You have made an attempt
to return him to the fold?

37:21.639 --> 37:24.518
I have. But he no
longer fears the sword.

37:25.543 --> 37:27.284
Here or hereafter.

37:27.511 --> 37:30.890
Sometimes, the lost lamb is
the most important to God.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.695
Is he beyond redemption?

37:33.985 --> 37:35.487
Unfortunately.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.590
So, you don't need my forgiveness.

37:39.924 --> 37:43.235
No. I need your wrath.

37:44.328 --> 37:45.966
When? Now.

37:48.866 --> 37:51.403
Give me a few minutes
to get changed.

37:53.838 --> 37:55.442
As it was before...

37:55.506 --> 37:57.179
So shall it be again.

38:08.786 --> 38:10.288
You're crazy, Nick.

38:10.688 --> 38:12.793
Well, maybe that will help.

38:13.658 --> 38:16.070
All right. What are his weaknesses?
He doesn't have any.

38:16.661 --> 38:18.402
Hank is coming here with backup.

38:18.462 --> 38:19.668
I just need to buy a
little bit of time.

38:19.730 --> 38:20.868
This isn't going to take that long.

38:26.370 --> 38:28.907
Oh, man. All right. Here we go.

38:30.975 --> 38:34.445
Listen to me. No, no, no.
That's your shield.

38:37.048 --> 38:39.619
You are going to have to
dig deep within yourself

38:39.684 --> 38:41.925
and, like, pull up the
history of your ancestors.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.363
And I mean all of them, man.

38:43.421 --> 38:45.731
Bring it. And just do
whatever you have to do.

38:45.790 --> 38:47.497
Because whatever they've
done to that guy over there

38:47.558 --> 38:49.560
has removed any shred of humanity.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.962
You are dealing with pure killer.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.907
Oh, wait. Wait. One more thing.
His right hand is weak.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.774
Okay? You can do this.

38:59.403 --> 39:00.643
I hope.

39:34.605 --> 39:35.743
That's it!

40:03.901 --> 40:05.778
That's it, Nick. You've got him.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.008
You've got him.

40:09.240 --> 40:12.915
Dimitri. I'm not your enemy.
I don't want to kill you.

40:16.447 --> 40:17.790
What happened to a fair fight?

40:19.817 --> 40:23.424
Hey, man. I just wanted to say
thanks for saving my life back there.

40:23.521 --> 40:24.761
Yeah, for however long that lasts.

40:24.822 --> 40:26.324
Here it comes. Bring it on!

40:26.424 --> 40:27.960
Don't say that.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.734
Police! Move out of the way.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.208
That's my cue. Yeah.

40:34.365 --> 40:35.503
Everybody, down on your knees!

40:35.566 --> 40:37.068
POLICEMAN 2: Get on your knees now!

40:37.468 --> 40:38.469
Go!

40:39.637 --> 40:41.173
You okay? Yeah.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.744
Who's that? It's Dimitri Skontos.

40:44.141 --> 40:45.882
Is he alive? Yeah, he's breathing.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.013
Where's Taymor?

40:47.077 --> 40:49.455
I don't know. I think he got away.

40:53.584 --> 40:55.257
Come on. Keep moving.

41:37.094 --> 41:38.402
Hello? Hey, honey.

41:38.462 --> 41:41.272
I'm on my way home.
I hope it's not too late.

41:42.600 --> 41:44.204
No. No, it's okay.

41:45.302 --> 41:47.282
Okay. I'll be home in a few.

41:49.306 --> 41:50.876
Love you. Okay.

42:20.538 --> 42:22.040
You did this.

42:22.373 --> 42:23.909
And you're going to pay!

42:24.441 --> 42:26.512
Well, one of us is.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
