Oh!

00:10.718 --> 00:13.453
And a spring in the seat
that is very into latinas.

00:14.522 --> 00:16.456
Okay, one more pothole

00:16.490 --> 00:18.592
and I'm going to have to bring
you home to meet my parents.

00:18.626 --> 00:21.461
God, this is so much better
than public transportation.

00:21.495 --> 00:24.097
I don't know why you never
want to drive with me.

00:24.131 --> 00:27.200

that's 40% stolen office supplies.

we're still moving, so...

Yeah, well, that's because
we're going downhill.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.935
Okay, and a little too fast. Now
would be a good time to pull over!

about the same!

I get it! You think my

I wish your car was
a piece of crap.

a "tragedy with seat belts."

02:30.558 --> 02:32.559
gave you her car
for your 16th birthday.

02:32.593 --> 02:34.394

It's just every time
I sit in that car,

to me, yelling "Brake! Brake! Brake!"

afford to fix that?

to nitpick,

I didn't get a hug.

of car trouble,

04:44.492 --> 04:47.260
which involved jumping out
of it to save my life.

04:47.294 --> 04:51.030
And then I was going to call you but
then the trolley ran over my phone.

04:51.065 --> 04:54.067

to pay for the repairs,

selling pies at the swap meet.

give me the mechanic's number

out for you.

I'll make sure he's not
ripping you off.

my research and

this is the perfect
mechanic to fix my car.

05:27.368 --> 05:29.169
Really?

05:29.203 --> 05:31.070
And how did you decide that?

05:31.105 --> 05:34.040
Well, he was the closest one that
Sofia and I could push it to.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.212
- Hey there.
- Hey.

05:39.246 --> 05:42.916

a rusty Toyota tercel in here?

05:42.950 --> 05:45.818

a piece like that.

05:45.853 --> 05:47.271
Excuse me?

05:47.272 --> 05:49.689
That car, man.
What a piece of junk.

05:49.723 --> 05:52.325
I told blondie she is gonna
take a lot of work, man.

05:52.359 --> 05:54.561
[Chuckles] Oh, I bet you did.

05:55.663 --> 05:58.464
Guess what? Now you're
dealing with this guy.

05:58.499 --> 06:02.135
So why don't you break it
down to me, man to man?

06:02.169 --> 06:05.171
Okay, the timing belt snapped, sent
the valves through the pistons,

06:05.206 --> 06:08.241
the transmission bands are shot, and
the camshaft bearings are dust.

06:10.044 --> 06:12.245
That's what I-I figured. Yeah, I-I
thought that was the problem.

06:13.881 --> 06:15.882
So how much is it
gonna cost to fix?

06:15.916 --> 06:18.017
[Sighs] Look, man, can
I be honest with you?

06:18.052 --> 06:20.587
That car is a coffin
on wheels, okay?

06:20.621 --> 06:21.921
I would not let
my mother drive it.

06:21.956 --> 06:24.891
Now, my mother-in-law, I'd give
it to her with a big bow on top.

06:24.925 --> 06:26.659
But guess what
I'm gonna do for you,

06:26.694 --> 06:29.529
I'll scrap it
and give you 500 bucks

06:29.563 --> 06:32.265
towards any of my fine
pre-owned automobiles

06:32.299 --> 06:34.267

at the swap meet tomorrow.

I'll figure something else out.?

pie's the limit!

No.

07:12.506 --> 07:15.041

something I did right.

07:15.075 --> 07:17.343
Oh yes, 'cause that's
super different.

something to show you.

- What?
- You're welcome.

07:44.438 --> 07:46.306
Wait, you bought me a car?

07:46.340 --> 07:47.440
Oh, here come the tears.

07:47.474 --> 07:50.076

I already have a car.

Wait, what?
Where's my car?

07:55.916 --> 07:58.951
I had 'em scrap it. Who's
excited for power windows?!

07:58.986 --> 08:02.021
Not me! You scrapped my car?!
How could you?

08:02.056 --> 08:04.824
Wait, you're mad at me?

08:04.858 --> 08:07.860
I don't get it. Everybody loves
Oprah when she gives out free cars.

08:07.895 --> 08:10.396
- You had no right to do that.
- [Snickers]

08:10.431 --> 08:12.699

say that's gonna make me feel bad

getting rid of that trash heap.

That was my mom's car.

08:18.172 --> 08:20.306

before she died.

- Stop talking.

not say anything?

08:43.763 --> 08:46.698
I mean how could you
sell my mom's car?!

08:46.732 --> 08:49.534
God, the ego on you! How does
your head even fit in here?

08:51.304 --> 08:53.405
Because it's actually
incredibly roomy for a compact?

08:56.275 --> 08:59.311
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be yelling at
the person who gives me a paycheck

08:59.345 --> 09:02.047
and buys me cars,
but how dare you?!

09:02.081 --> 09:05.884
This is the worst nice thing that
anybody has ever done for me.

09:05.918 --> 09:08.753
I'm serious, I am boiling mad!

09:08.788 --> 09:10.955
That actually might be
the heated seats.

09:10.990 --> 09:13.558
I paid a little extra for them.

09:14.960 --> 09:16.795
You better pray that
my car is still...

09:16.829 --> 09:18.630
- [Sigh of relief]
- Oh, you're still here!

09:18.664 --> 09:20.632
I thought I'd never
see you again.

09:20.666 --> 09:23.501
God, the thought of anyone else
inside you just kills me.

09:25.738 --> 09:27.439
And you're all in one piece.

09:30.476 --> 09:34.245
- More or less.
- Aha, there's the happy couple.

09:34.280 --> 09:36.281
We are not happy or a couple.

09:36.315 --> 09:39.851
Listen, guys, whatever the
problem is, we can fix it.

09:39.885 --> 09:41.219
The customer's always right.

09:41.253 --> 09:44.022
Good. Because I
traded this car in

09:44.056 --> 09:45.390
and bought one of
your newer models which

09:45.391 --> 09:46.725
I need to now trade
back for this one.

09:46.759 --> 09:48.960
Mm-hmm, okay.
Not gonna happen.

09:48.994 --> 09:50.845
No no no. Excuse me.
Sir, I really think

09:50.846 --> 09:52.697
you're gonna want
to change your mind

09:52.732 --> 09:54.650
when you hear how guilty
this man feels about

09:54.651 --> 09:56.568
selling you the car
that my mother gave me,

09:56.602 --> 09:58.636
and how he'll do anything
to get it back,

09:58.671 --> 10:00.772
so just name your price,
he's a millionaire.

10:00.806 --> 10:04.175
Look, I understand you've got
a little situation going on

10:04.210 --> 10:07.178
and I'm no crook, so I'll let you
drive it off the lot for 10,000.

10:07.213 --> 10:09.114
10,000?!

10:09.148 --> 10:11.182
- Fine, sold.
- Wait, seriously?

10:11.250 --> 10:13.385
Gabi, this guy's got us
by the lug nuts.

10:15.087 --> 10:17.222
Someone decided to tell
him I'm a millionaire.

10:17.256 --> 10:19.791
But I want to make this up to you.
So you said 10, right?

10:19.825 --> 10:21.693
- Did I? I meant 20.
- 20?!

10:21.727 --> 10:22.344
Okay, 20.

10:22.345 --> 10:23.795
No, that's crazy.
Josh, you can't do this.

10:23.829 --> 10:24.588
I can and I will.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.865
Okay, 30 and you're out
the door no questions asked.

10:26.866 --> 10:28.666
No, stop.
This is ridiculous.

10:28.701 --> 10:30.502
Sir, you should be
ashamed of yourself.

10:30.536 --> 10:32.637
Me? What about what
he did to you?

10:32.671 --> 10:35.740
Okay? You love this car.
This is your momma's car.

10:35.775 --> 10:38.710
All right? You don't turn
your back on family, girl.

10:41.247 --> 10:43.348
- I think we should go.
- Gabi, please, just let me...

10:43.382 --> 10:46.050
No. Josh, I can't live
with myself if you do this.

10:46.085 --> 10:49.053
Hey, why don't we all just
calm down and go to the bank?

10:56.996 --> 10:58.763
Where have you been?

10:58.798 --> 11:00.865
I was riding a horse
on the beach with taye diggs.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.034
Where the hell
you think I've been?

11:03.068 --> 11:06.971
Well, thank God you're back,
because I have got some dirt.

11:07.006 --> 11:10.608
And I got some cleaning
supplies, so spill!

11:11.777 --> 11:14.512
Guess who bought miss
hanging-by-a-thread a car?

11:14.547 --> 11:18.183
- Miss who got a what?
- Mm-hmm.

11:18.217 --> 11:22.220
Apparently, being a responsible
adult around here gets you nothing.

11:22.254 --> 11:25.356
Turns out the squeaky
wheel does get the oil.

11:25.391 --> 11:28.359
- And a car to put it in.
- Mm-hmm!

11:29.395 --> 11:31.930
Oh, well, look who's back.

11:31.964 --> 11:33.832
How's the new car Josh got you,

11:33.866 --> 11:37.101
that he didn't get anybody else who's
worked here much longer than you?

11:37.136 --> 11:39.604
- I hate it.
- [Gasps]

11:39.638 --> 11:42.006
Quick, Josh, buy her
a bedroom to go stomp into.

11:42.041 --> 11:44.609
Guys, not now.

11:44.643 --> 11:46.161
Well, yesterday you
said you treat her

11:46.162 --> 11:47.679
differently because
her life's a mess.

11:47.713 --> 11:49.414
But I'm starting to think
it's something else.

11:49.448 --> 11:52.517
Now I don't want to play
the race card...

11:52.551 --> 11:54.285
Or the gay card...

11:55.354 --> 11:57.489
Or the age card...

11:57.523 --> 12:00.992
Or the Asian card...

12:01.026 --> 12:03.027
But you're prejudiced!

12:03.062 --> 12:06.197
- Look, guys...
- Sorry, there's nothing you can say

12:06.232 --> 12:10.735
to make us feel bad about the
miss I-get-a-hug-on-demand.

12:12.137 --> 12:14.606
How about that I sold
her late mother's car

12:14.640 --> 12:16.708
and it was the only thing
Gabi had left of her.

12:16.742 --> 12:19.611
Oh.

12:19.645 --> 12:21.813
Come here, honey.

12:21.847 --> 12:23.848
I had no idea.

12:23.883 --> 12:26.417
Why the hell would you
do something like that?

12:28.387 --> 12:30.655
I can't believe I was seriously
thinking about sleeping with you!

12:34.593 --> 12:38.196
So why don't you just buy the car
back for this sweet baby girl?

12:38.230 --> 12:40.198
Oh, but we tried to,
but when Josh told him

12:40.232 --> 12:43.835
he was a millionaire, he just
tried to take advantage of us.

12:45.037 --> 12:48.072
Sounds like you need
someone he's not expecting.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.708
Someone who can pull
the wool over his eyes.

12:50.743 --> 12:52.944
A beautiful streetwise diva.

12:54.947 --> 12:57.448
All right, I'll do it.

12:58.517 --> 13:00.518
Okay, so you pretty much
saw everything,

13:00.553 --> 13:02.003
except for two
cars I got parked

13:02.004 --> 13:03.454
across the street
at the liquor store.

13:03.489 --> 13:05.356
Anything strike your fancy?

13:09.194 --> 13:11.429
Well, as sweet, broke newlyweds

13:11.463 --> 13:14.065
we're just trying to get
the best deal we can get.

13:14.099 --> 13:17.936
That's right. We're just a
couple of crazy heteros in love.

13:20.172 --> 13:22.707
Oh, honey!

13:22.741 --> 13:24.042
That one looks pretty.

13:24.076 --> 13:25.843
Oh no no no, you don't
want that one.

13:25.878 --> 13:28.746
The bumper is a pool noodle.

13:28.781 --> 13:30.615
I find it to be charming.

13:31.784 --> 13:34.886
Oh, this reminds me of the
car I drove in college.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.755
I didn't think cars existed
when you were in college.

13:37.790 --> 13:39.490
[Laughing]

13:42.394 --> 13:44.228
We kid like that.

13:44.263 --> 13:46.331
You know how
newly married couples do.

13:46.365 --> 13:48.333
Hmmm.
So newlyweds, huh?

13:48.367 --> 13:50.301
Where did you two lovebirds
honeymoon?

13:50.336 --> 13:51.970
- Paris.
- Las Vegas.

13:52.004 --> 13:54.806
We went to the
Paris hotel in Vegas.

13:54.840 --> 13:56.391
Okay, I'm gonna go
out on a limb here and

13:56.392 --> 13:57.942
say I don't think
you two are a couple.

13:57.977 --> 13:59.978
We are... a couple
of people who can't

13:59.979 --> 14:01.980
keep their hands
off each other.

14:02.014 --> 14:03.781
[Gasps]

14:05.985 --> 14:08.686
Each touch is like
the first time.

14:11.457 --> 14:14.592
In fact, I think you two are
here on someone else's behalf.

14:14.627 --> 14:17.462
I don't know what
you're talking 'bout.

14:19.365 --> 14:22.066
Well okay, if you two
are so in love,

14:22.101 --> 14:24.035
why don't you
lay a kiss on her?

14:24.069 --> 14:25.269
- What?
- Wha-what... what?

14:25.304 --> 14:28.072
Hmm, one nice kiss...

14:28.107 --> 14:29.340
And the car is all yours.

14:32.344 --> 14:34.145
- Okay, boy.
- Here we go.

14:34.179 --> 14:35.813
You can do this.

14:37.182 --> 14:40.585
Denzel. Denzel.
Denzel.

14:40.619 --> 14:41.925
Gabi's just gonna have
to get over this car!

14:41.960 --> 14:42.931
Thank God!

14:46.282 --> 14:48.183
Hey there, you got a second?

14:48.217 --> 14:49.734
That depends, you
got 30 grand and some

14:49.735 --> 14:51.252
more friends you
want to bring in?

14:52.455 --> 14:54.956
I know, I know. You can't
blame a girl for trying.

14:55.190 --> 14:58.226
Look, I brought you a box
of stuff for the next owner.

14:58.260 --> 15:01.362
Um, this is a list of hills
that she can't make it up.

15:05.968 --> 15:08.236
All right, whoa whoa, what are
you talking about? Next owner?

15:08.270 --> 15:10.838
I've been holding this car
waiting for you to come back.

15:10.873 --> 15:12.173
I know, I know.

15:12.207 --> 15:14.642
But now, you don't have to.

15:14.677 --> 15:16.194
Listen, I'm starting
to think this whole

15:16.195 --> 15:17.712
thing is really just
a sign from my mom.

15:17.746 --> 15:20.581
She's telling me that
it's time to let the car go.

15:20.616 --> 15:22.684
Why are you listening
to your momma?!

15:23.819 --> 15:26.287
You're a grown woman.

15:26.321 --> 15:28.489
Yes, I know, but I think
it's time to...

15:28.524 --> 15:32.326
Move on. So, will you please
just let the next owner know...

15:32.361 --> 15:35.296
[Loudly] That the parking brake
sticks and you have to kick it!

15:37.166 --> 15:39.934
Sweetie, how about this?
Let's take one more look

15:39.968 --> 15:41.169
- before you make this rash decision.
- No no no!

15:41.203 --> 15:43.137
I can't, I can't!
Ahem.

15:43.172 --> 15:47.608
No, I can't. I can't
look at that great car

15:47.643 --> 15:50.778
with the steering wheel that
locks unless you jiggle it.

15:50.813 --> 15:53.548
But you have to be careful
because the horn works.

15:56.552 --> 15:59.487
You are hysterical. Do you
need me to call somebody?

15:59.521 --> 16:02.223
No, it's just all the memories.

16:02.257 --> 16:05.193
You know, it was just...
It was such a great car.

16:05.227 --> 16:07.295
And I really don't know
how I'm ever gonna...

16:07.329 --> 16:09.497
How I'm ever gonna move on.
[Fake sobs]

16:12.101 --> 16:13.101
But I will.
Thank you.

16:15.270 --> 16:17.839
Hmm, I got her
right where I want her.

16:20.809 --> 16:22.844
Oh, I don't know
whether to be terrified

16:22.878 --> 16:25.913
or excited at how well
you guys just pulled that off!

16:25.948 --> 16:29.050
Whoo! If this wasn't a
felony, I'd do it every day.

16:29.084 --> 16:31.953
Uh, now might be
a bad time to ask,

16:31.987 --> 16:35.523
but does anyone else in this car
have two strikes against them?

16:36.525 --> 16:39.660
Oh, this spring
is very into asians.

16:39.695 --> 16:43.231
[Laughs] Wait 'til it
goes over a pothole.

16:43.265 --> 16:44.532
Oh oh oh!

16:44.566 --> 16:47.435
- Oh, you are so right.
- [Claps]

16:47.469 --> 16:49.103
Man, I'm so amped!

16:49.138 --> 16:51.272
I feel like there's electricity
coursing through my veins.

16:51.306 --> 16:53.975
Ah, well, there might be. There's
a loose wire in the dash.

16:54.009 --> 16:56.177
- Yeah.
- [Engine banging, sputtering]

16:58.347 --> 17:00.181
- Uh-oh.
- Uh, Gabi?

17:00.215 --> 17:02.116
What do we do
when your car does this?

17:02.151 --> 17:03.785
Get the hell out and run.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.890
Are you putting on lipstick?!

17:08.924 --> 17:10.992
You're damn right.
Where there's smoke,

17:11.026 --> 17:12.827
there's firemen.

17:14.000 --> 17:20.074

17:23.672 --> 17:26.307
I would like to thank
you all for coming

17:26.340 --> 17:28.609
to help me say goodbye

17:28.644 --> 17:31.412
to my beloved car.

17:31.446 --> 17:34.315
I'm grateful for all the years
that we had together,

17:34.349 --> 17:37.952
and that we all made it out alive
before she went up in a ball of fire.

17:39.288 --> 17:41.989
But she sure looked pretty
all lit up like that.

17:43.959 --> 17:47.628
So if you have any memories you would
like to share, now would be the time.

17:47.663 --> 17:49.564
I remember how you
pretended the rusted hole

17:49.598 --> 17:51.699
in your ceiling was a sunroof.

17:52.868 --> 17:54.669
I remember when
that homeless guy

17:54.736 --> 17:56.604
at the off-ramp
gave us money.

17:58.473 --> 18:01.242
I remember the time I was
bored at a car funeral.

18:01.276 --> 18:03.177
Sorry for your loss!

18:04.179 --> 18:05.546
Here, I made this for you.

18:05.581 --> 18:08.382
It's your window crank. I
turned it into an egg beater.

18:08.417 --> 18:11.085
Oh, cute.

18:11.119 --> 18:14.088
And here's the hula girl you
used to keep on your dashboard.

18:14.122 --> 18:16.991
I swiped it before
everything caught fire.

18:18.927 --> 18:20.194
You guys all know
that that car was

18:20.229 --> 18:21.929
the last connection
that I had to my mom

18:21.964 --> 18:23.998
and that's why I had such a
hard time letting her go.

18:24.032 --> 18:28.636
But I look around this room and I
start to realize what I do have:

18:28.670 --> 18:30.938
Somebody who will hold my
hand whenever I need it;

18:30.973 --> 18:33.674
somebody who will keep
me safe no matter what;

18:33.709 --> 18:36.444
a confidante who
always has my back;

18:36.478 --> 18:38.096
and somebody who tells
you like it is,

18:38.097 --> 18:39.714
no matter how much you
don't want to hear it.

18:41.450 --> 18:43.217
I think this is going on
a little long.

18:45.354 --> 18:47.521
You guys know that nothing
could ever replace my mom,

18:47.556 --> 18:49.257
but I'm starting
to think that...

18:49.291 --> 18:53.127
She gave me four people that
come pretty damn close.

18:53.161 --> 18:54.161
[Sniffles]

18:55.230 --> 18:57.999
Elliot, are you crying?

18:58.033 --> 19:00.835
No, it's just allergies.

19:02.104 --> 19:04.772
I'm allergic to squalor.

19:08.644 --> 19:11.779
Now, we have the traditional
car funeral food...

19:11.813 --> 19:13.848
Lots and lots of lemon pie.

19:16.051 --> 19:18.786
One for you, one for you.

19:20.689 --> 19:22.556
Girl, hand me a fork.

19:30.773 --> 19:32.407
Elliot, you okay?

19:33.442 --> 19:34.776
Yeah, I'm fine.

19:37.413 --> 19:38.379
Okay.

19:38.414 --> 19:39.547
It's just...

19:40.583 --> 19:41.649
What's the matter?

19:42.852 --> 19:44.652
Nothing.

19:44.687 --> 19:46.754
Hey, you can tell me.

19:48.791 --> 19:52.493
The HD-TV
my dad gave me as a child

19:52.528 --> 19:55.496
stopped working last night.

19:55.531 --> 19:57.632
And now it's gone.

19:57.666 --> 19:59.434
All 60 inches.

20:00.469 --> 20:01.469
[Gasps]

20:01.503 --> 20:04.939
Is that an electronics
catalogue right there?

20:07.084 --> 20:08.430
Elliot!

20:08.431 --> 20:12.728
Free shipping!
When you buy surround sound.

20:13.209 --> 20:14.410
It's a sign!

20:14.814 --> 20:16.158
Not falling for it.

20:17.183 --> 20:19.772
Sorry!
