WEBVTT

00:01.867 --> 00:03.367
- SO I DON'T KNOW, DEBRA.

00:03.367 --> 00:05.033
WE WENT TO MARCO'S LAST NIGHT,
AND AMY SAYS,

00:05.033 --> 00:07.633
"I MUST HAVE HAD EVERYTHING
ON THIS MENU A HUNDRED TIMES."

00:07.633 --> 00:08.933
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:08.933 --> 00:10.867
- MAYBE AMY'S TRYING
TO TELL YOU SHE'D LIKE

00:10.867 --> 00:12.867
TO GO SOMEPLACE ELSE.

00:12.867 --> 00:14.067
- AND WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

00:14.067 --> 00:16.400
- RAY.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.967
- YOU GOT TO READ
BETWEEN THE LINES.

00:19.967 --> 00:22.233
- HEY.
- HEY, ANDY.

00:22.233 --> 00:25.933
- OH, I TOLD YOU
WE SHOULD SPRAY.

00:25.933 --> 00:27.533
- HOW YOU DOIN', ANDY?

00:27.533 --> 00:28.767
YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE LOSING WEIGHT.

00:28.767 --> 00:32.867
- NAH, I JUST GAVE UP
TUCKING IN MY SHIRT.

00:32.867 --> 00:34.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:34.300 --> 00:36.300
WHAT, ARE YOU HERE TO TELL
EVERYBODY YOUR BIG NEWS?

00:36.300 --> 00:37.733
ANDY GOT A NEW JOB
BOOKING GUESTS

00:37.733 --> 00:38.933
ON A NATIONAL RADIO SHOW.

00:38.933 --> 00:40.967
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS, ANDY.

00:40.967 --> 00:44.033
- WOW.
THIS PROVES IT.

00:44.033 --> 00:48.100
THE LADIES LIKE GUYS
WITH JOBS.

00:49.733 --> 00:51.133
- WHOSE SHOW IS IT?

00:51.133 --> 00:52.867
- JERRY MUSSO,
BIG SPORTS RADIO GUY.

00:52.867 --> 00:55.700
- OH, I'VE HEARD JERRY MUSSO.
NEVER CARED FOR HIM.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.367
- NOBODY ASKED YOU.

00:57.367 --> 00:59.167
THIS IS
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR ANDY,

00:59.167 --> 01:00.700
AND I TOLD HIM
THAT I WOULD DO THE SHOW.

01:00.700 --> 01:03.833
YOU KNOW,
THROW HIM A BONE.

01:03.833 --> 01:07.100
- ACTUALLY, RAY, THAT'S WHAT
I CAME OVER TO TELL YOU.

01:07.100 --> 01:09.167
I'M AFRAID I HAVE TO...

01:09.167 --> 01:12.367
RETURN YOUR BONE.

01:12.367 --> 01:13.767
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:13.767 --> 01:15.833
- I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE
TO BOOK YOU ON THE SHOW.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.233
- WHY NOT?

01:18.233 --> 01:21.633
- JERRY MUSSO
DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

01:21.633 --> 01:23.233
- DOESN'T LIKE ME?

01:23.233 --> 01:27.233
- WHAT STATION
IS HE GOING TO BE ON?

01:27.233 --> 01:29.600
- DOESN'T LIKE ME?
WHAT DID HE SAY?

01:29.600 --> 01:31.200
I MEAN,
WHAT WERE HIS EXACT WORDS?

01:31.200 --> 01:32.500
- I DIDN'T HEAR IT FROM HIM.

01:32.500 --> 01:34.567
I WAS GOING OVER MY LIST
WITH THE EXECUTIVE PRODUCER,

01:34.567 --> 01:35.667
AND HE SAW YOUR NAME,
AND HE GOES,

01:35.667 --> 01:37.333
"OH, JERRY'S NEVER GONNA
GO FOR THIS.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.400
HE DOESN'T LIKE RAY BARONE."

01:39.400 --> 01:41.733
- WELL, MAYBE HE'S CONFUSING RAY
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:41.733 --> 01:43.233
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

01:43.233 --> 01:45.367
SO I SUBMITTED
YOUR NAME ANYWAY,

01:45.367 --> 01:48.567
AND STILL, IT CAME BACK:

01:48.567 --> 01:50.767
"NO. NO WAY.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.800
JERRY HATES RAY BARONE."

01:53.800 --> 01:57.067
- HATES?
IT SAYS "HATES."

01:58.800 --> 02:02.433
- WHERE DO YOU GO
TO GET STUFF FRAMED?

02:10.700 --> 02:14.500
- [singing] JUNGLE LOVE
IS DRIVING ME MAD.

02:14.500 --> 02:17.600
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY.

02:17.600 --> 02:20.933
JUNGLE LOVE
IS DRIVING ME MAD.

02:20.933 --> 02:24.200
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY.

02:24.200 --> 02:27.267
JUNGLE LOVE,
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD.

02:27.267 --> 02:30.500
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY,
CRAZY.

02:30.500 --> 02:33.833
JUNGLE LOVE,
IT'S DRIVING ME MAD.

02:33.833 --> 02:38.300
IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY.

02:41.400 --> 02:42.933
- HATES ME?
JERRY MUSSO HATES ME?

02:42.933 --> 02:45.067
- YOU KNOW, I'M SURE
HE DIDN'T MEAN HATE.

02:45.067 --> 02:47.300
- IT'S IN WRITING.

02:47.300 --> 02:49.067
- ANDY, COME ON, JUST...

02:49.067 --> 02:50.367
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.600
DOES JERRY MUSSO HATE ME?

02:52.600 --> 02:53.667
- I DON'T KNOW.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.133
I WASN'T THE ONE
WHO TALKED TO HIM.

02:55.133 --> 02:56.433
- WELL, ASK HIM.

02:56.433 --> 02:58.167
- OH, NO.
LOOK, I JUST GOT THIS JOB.

02:58.167 --> 03:00.267
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH A MAN

03:00.267 --> 03:04.067
MY BOSS HATES?

03:04.067 --> 03:05.233
- HATES ME.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.733
- HATES YOU.

03:06.733 --> 03:08.100
- REALLY? HATES?

03:08.100 --> 03:12.067
- HATES. YOU.
HATES YOU, I'M SORRY.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.333
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW THE GUY.
I NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

03:14.333 --> 03:16.200
- DID YOU WRITE SOMETHING
BAD ABOUT HIM?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.800
- NO, I'VE NEVER WRITTEN
ABOUT HIM AT ALL.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.600
- MAYBE THAT'S WHY
HE HATES YOU.

03:20.600 --> 03:24.300
- COME ON, WHY WOULD HE CARE
IF HE WAS IN RAY'S COLUMN?

03:27.067 --> 03:28.400
- WHAT?

03:28.400 --> 03:29.900
- NO. IT'S JUST THAT

03:29.900 --> 03:32.067
IT'S NOT LIKE
IT'S, YOU KNOW, THE FRONT PAGE.

03:32.067 --> 03:34.067
I MEAN, PEOPLE READ
YOUR COLUMN FOR,

03:34.067 --> 03:36.067
YOU KNOW, FUN.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.200
IT'S JUST A FUNNY LITTLE...

03:38.200 --> 03:41.300
IT'S FUNNY.

03:43.067 --> 03:45.833
- YOU HATE MY WRITING.
- NO!

03:45.833 --> 03:48.733
NO. I'M SUPPORTING YOU.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.833
YOUR WRITING IS...

03:50.833 --> 03:52.067
WOW.

03:52.067 --> 03:53.300
- YEAH, OKAY, THANK YOU.

03:53.300 --> 03:56.600
THAT'S ENOUGH SUPPORT.

03:56.600 --> 03:58.600
WHY THE HELL
WOULD THIS GUY HATE ME?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.533
- I DON'T KNOW, DID YOU SLEEP
WITH HIS WIFE OR SOMETHING?

04:01.533 --> 04:05.967
- [giggling]

04:05.967 --> 04:09.967
- WHAT?

04:09.967 --> 04:14.533
- SLEPT WITH HIS WIFE...

04:14.533 --> 04:15.567
- OH, WHAT?

04:15.567 --> 04:17.067
NOW I'M NOT
ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH

04:17.067 --> 04:18.233
TO SLEEP WITH HIS WIFE?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.867
- YOU'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.200
- JUST NOT TO ANYONE ELSE.

04:22.200 --> 04:24.300
- DID YOU SLEEP WITH HIS WIFE?

04:24.300 --> 04:27.133
- IF I DID, SHE WOULD LIKE IT.

04:31.067 --> 04:33.200
- I KNOW, HONEY.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.267
YOU COULD SLEEP
WITH ALL THE WIVES IN THE WORLD

04:35.267 --> 04:36.933
IF YOU WANTED TO.

04:36.933 --> 04:40.067
YOU'RE SUPER HOT.

04:40.067 --> 04:42.733
- [laughing]

04:46.167 --> 04:48.067
- WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

04:48.067 --> 04:50.600
- IT KILLS YOU
THAT SOMEBODY HATES YOU.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.533
- HEY, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CALL HIM UP?

04:52.533 --> 04:55.333
- OH, I CAN'T CALL
SOMEBODY UP THAT HATES ME.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.400
- HEY, MAYBE BACK
IN THE OLD COUNTRY,

04:57.400 --> 04:58.833
YOUR GREAT-GRANDFATHER

04:58.833 --> 05:00.800
KILLED JERRY MUSSO'S
GREAT-GRANDFATHER,

05:00.800 --> 05:03.600
AND THEIR FAMILY
SWORE VENGEANCE.

05:03.600 --> 05:06.400
- BUT NOW HE FEELS
THE GYPSY CURSE

05:06.400 --> 05:10.200
THAT PRODUCED YOUR NOSE
WAS NOT SUFFICIENT.

05:19.233 --> 05:21.100
- FRANK, TURN OFF
THAT DAMN TELEVISION

05:21.100 --> 05:22.600
AND GET IN HERE.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.233
I'M GONNA THROW
THIS LASAGNA IN THE GARBAGE!

05:25.233 --> 05:29.067
OH, HELLO, DEAR.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.767
WE WERE JUST
SITTING DOWN TO DINNER.

05:30.767 --> 05:32.233
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME?

05:32.233 --> 05:33.700
- NO, NO, NO, I JUST CAME
TO GIVE YOU

05:33.700 --> 05:34.933
YOUR BIG SPOON BACK.

05:34.933 --> 05:36.233
YOU'RE NOT HUNGRY?

05:36.233 --> 05:38.133
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:38.133 --> 05:39.367
YOU DON'T LOOK SO GOOD.

05:39.367 --> 05:41.333
- NO, I'M FINE, MA.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.067
- NO, YOU LOOK TERRIBLE.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.667
YOU BETTER EAT SOMETHING.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.500
- LET'S GO.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.967
I'VE GOT TWO MINUTES
TILL THE COMMERCIAL'S OVER.

05:49.967 --> 05:53.867
- FRANK, DOESN'T RAYMOND
LOOK ALL WORN OUT AND TIRED?

05:53.867 --> 05:58.067
- WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
HE'S BEEN TALKING TO YOU.

05:58.067 --> 06:00.267
LET'S GO, LASAGNA TIME.

06:00.267 --> 06:03.633
CHOP-CHOP.

06:03.633 --> 06:05.167
- TALK TO ME, RAYMOND.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.367
WHAT'S WRONG?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.800
- NOTHING, IT'S NOTHING.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.067
IT'S JUST...

06:10.067 --> 06:12.633
[stammers]

06:12.633 --> 06:14.967
HAVE YOU EVER KNOWN
ANYBODY THAT...

06:14.967 --> 06:16.733
I DON'T KNOW...

06:16.733 --> 06:17.967
DIDN'T LIKE ME?

06:17.967 --> 06:19.233
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.067
YOU'RE A SWEET BOY.

06:21.067 --> 06:23.067
PEOPLE ADORE YOU.

06:23.067 --> 06:25.567
- WELL, NOT JERRY MUSSO.
- WHO?

06:25.567 --> 06:27.800
- JERRY MUSSO, THE RADIO GUY?
- YEAH.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.767
- HE'S PRETTY GOOD.

06:30.767 --> 06:32.067
- HE HATES ME.

06:32.067 --> 06:33.233
- [gasps]
WHAT'S HIS NUMBER?

06:33.233 --> 06:34.700
I'M GONNA CALL HIM.

06:34.700 --> 06:36.567
- NO! MOM, IT'S OKAY.

06:36.567 --> 06:38.500
- IF I COULD JUST TALK TO HIM
FOR A FEW MINUTES,

06:38.500 --> 06:41.200
HE WOULD FALL IN LOVE
WITH YOU.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.333
- AND HATE HER.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.067
- YOU KNOW, THE THING IS,
I DON'T HATE HIM.

06:47.067 --> 06:48.600
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T HATE ANYBODY.

06:48.600 --> 06:51.967
- YES, THAT'S ONE OF YOUR
WONDERFUL QUALITIES.

06:51.967 --> 06:54.167
YOU GOT THAT FROM ME.

06:54.167 --> 06:57.200
- CAN I GET AN ICED TEA
FROM YOU?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.067
- YOUR FATHER,
ON THE OTHER HAND,

06:59.067 --> 07:00.900
HATES EVERYBODY.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.267
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.

07:02.267 --> 07:03.833
THERE'S ONLY
SOME PEOPLE I HATE.

07:03.833 --> 07:07.233
THE REST I TOLERATE.

07:07.233 --> 07:08.933
- BE QUIET.

07:08.933 --> 07:12.133
- CAREFUL, MARIE,
YOU'RE RIGHT ON THE FENCE.

07:16.267 --> 07:17.600
- DON'T LISTEN TO HIM,
RAYMOND.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.433
YOU AND I
ARE NOT LIKE HIM.

07:19.433 --> 07:20.900
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:20.900 --> 07:22.533
YOU HATE PLENTY OF PEOPLE.

07:22.533 --> 07:24.600
- I DO NOT HATE PEOPLE, FRANK.

07:24.600 --> 07:26.700
- OH, YEAH?
WHAT ABOUT MY MOTHER?

07:26.700 --> 07:28.267
YOU HATED HER LIKE POISON.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.367
- FIRST OF ALL,
I DID NOT HATE HER.

07:30.367 --> 07:33.600
I FELT SORRY FOR HER.

07:33.600 --> 07:35.567
- WHAT ABOUT
HARRIET LICHTMAN?

07:35.567 --> 07:38.500
- I FIND HARRIET LICHTMAN'S

07:38.500 --> 07:42.500
FLIRTATIOUS BEHAVIOR
TOWARDS YOU DISTASTEFUL.

07:42.500 --> 07:45.500
BUT I DO NOT HATE THAT SLUT.

07:51.633 --> 07:52.967
- HEY, EVERYBODY.

07:52.967 --> 07:54.367
I TOOK AMY OUT LAST NIGHT

07:54.367 --> 07:56.333
TO THE GREATEST
NEW SEAFOOD RESTAURANT,

07:56.333 --> 07:58.333
AND I'M GONNA TAKE ALL OF YOU
THERE NEXT SATURDAY.

07:58.333 --> 08:00.533
HUH?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

08:00.533 --> 08:03.767
- IF I JUST KNEW
WHY JERRY HATED ME, YOU KNOW...

08:03.767 --> 08:05.467
I MEAN, THAT'S
WHAT'S KILLING ME.

08:05.467 --> 08:07.100
- I'M GONNA WRITE
THAT MAN A LETTER.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.833
- HELLO?

08:08.833 --> 08:12.333
NICE ANNOUNCEMENT HERE
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE.

08:12.333 --> 08:13.833
- THAT'S VERY NICE, ROBBIE.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.233
JUST GET ME HIS ADDRESS,
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

08:16.233 --> 08:18.100
- OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

08:18.100 --> 08:20.067
- I KNOW,
WHY WOULD A GUY HATE ME?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.700
- WHAT IS WITH YOU?

08:21.700 --> 08:24.433
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT SOMEBODY COULD HATE YOU?

08:24.433 --> 08:26.433
IS IT SO IMPOSSIBLE TO FATHOM

08:26.433 --> 08:29.367
THAT SOMEWHERE
IN THIS VAST COSMOS,

08:29.367 --> 08:32.300
THERE MIGHT EXIST
A SINGLE ENTITY

08:32.300 --> 08:34.533
THAT THINKS YOU SUCK?

08:41.433 --> 08:44.500
- ROBBIE, WE DO NOT SAY "SUCK."

08:44.500 --> 08:46.900
AND IF WE DID,
RAYMOND CERTAINLY WOULDN'T.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.267
- NO.

08:48.267 --> 08:49.867
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, MAN?

08:49.867 --> 08:51.133
- I'M JUST TIRED OF THIS.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.600
I MEAN,
YOU HAVE THE TINIEST PROBLEM,

08:52.600 --> 08:55.233
AND WE ALL HAVE TO STOP
AND ROCK YOU IN YOUR SNUGGLY

08:55.233 --> 08:56.600
TILL YOU'RE ALL BETTER.

08:56.600 --> 08:58.567
I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS
FOR 40 YEARS.

08:58.567 --> 09:00.200
- YOU COULD'VE USED SOME
OF THAT TIME

09:00.200 --> 09:01.433
TO WASH YOUR FEET.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.167
- OH, RAYMOND,
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.433
WE'RE EATING.

09:04.433 --> 09:06.767
- PEOPLE HATE YOU, RAYMOND.

09:06.767 --> 09:08.433
THEY HATE YOU.

09:08.433 --> 09:11.833
THEY'RE OUT THERE, MAN.

09:11.833 --> 09:13.100
- MAYBE YOU HATE ME.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.433
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:14.433 --> 09:16.300
IF I DID,
IT WOULDN'T BOTHER YOU

09:16.300 --> 09:18.300
AS MUCH AS SOME GUY
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HATING YOU.

09:18.300 --> 09:19.600
- YOU'VE ALWAYS HATED ME.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.133
YOU JUST
NEVER HAD THE GUTS TO SAY IT.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.500
- OH, NO?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.400
- ARE WE DOING
GARLIC BREAD OR WHAT?

09:24.400 --> 09:26.933
- ROBBIE DOESN'T HATE YOU.
EAT SOMETHING.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.533
- MAYBE I DO HATE YOU.
- ROBBIE!

09:28.533 --> 09:30.167
- MAYBE I HATE YOU TOO!
- RAYMOND!

09:30.167 --> 09:31.633
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:31.633 --> 09:33.567
I DON'T CARE,
YOU LITTLE CRYBABY WUSSBALL.

09:33.567 --> 09:36.233
- OH, WHY DON'T YOU GO EAT
AT YOUR NEW SEAFOOD RESTAURANT?

09:36.233 --> 09:38.167
- WHY DON'T YOU?
- WHY DON'T YOU?

09:38.167 --> 09:40.067
- STOP IT, BOYS!
- YOU FATHEAD!

09:40.067 --> 09:41.267
- COME ON.
I WON'T HAVE THIS!

09:41.267 --> 09:42.767
- YOU MAKE ME SICK!

09:42.767 --> 09:44.067
- AW, YOU'RE AN APE-MAN!

09:44.067 --> 09:45.300
- OH, YEAH? AM I?

09:45.300 --> 09:46.600
WELL, YOU WANT
TO KNOW SOMETHING?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.433
YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHO THE GENIUS IS?

09:48.433 --> 09:51.800
JERRY MUSSO, BECAUSE HE WAS
THE FIRST TO SAY IT BEFORE ME.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.167
HATE! HATE!

09:53.167 --> 09:56.533
- OH, FINE!
AND I HATE YOU TOO!

09:56.533 --> 09:58.400
- I HATE YOU!

10:10.700 --> 10:12.400
- I GOT TO TELL YA, MARIE,

10:12.400 --> 10:15.700
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE EXCITED.

10:27.600 --> 10:28.767
- WHAT'S WRONG?

10:28.767 --> 10:30.733
- IT'S THIS WHOLE
JERRY MUSSO THING.

10:30.733 --> 10:32.233
I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT IT.

10:32.233 --> 10:34.133
- JERRY MUSSO?

10:34.133 --> 10:36.167
YOUR OWN BROTHER TELLS YOU
THAT HE HATES YOU.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.767
YOU CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT JERRY MUSSO.

10:37.767 --> 10:40.400
- ROBERT'S ALWAYS HATED ME,
BUT JERRY MUSSO--

10:40.400 --> 10:43.667
- MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.
HE'S NOBODY.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.567
YOU SHOULD GO MAKE UP
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

10:45.567 --> 10:49.467
- I'M NOT MAKING UP WITH HIM.

10:49.467 --> 10:51.467
HE SHOULD GET DOWN
ON HIS KNEES,

10:51.467 --> 10:55.800
LOOK ME IN THE EYE,
AND APOLOGIZE.

10:55.800 --> 10:57.533
- YOU'RE SO IMMATURE.

10:57.533 --> 10:59.267
YOU COULD MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.067
- OH, LISTEN TO YOU,

11:01.067 --> 11:03.433
THE PERSON WHO WOULDN'T TALK
TO MY MOTHER FOR THREE MONTHS.

11:03.433 --> 11:04.900
- THAT WAS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

11:04.900 --> 11:07.233
- HOW?
- SHUT UP.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.900
[knock on door]

11:08.900 --> 11:10.133
- HEY, GUYS.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.567
- HEY, ANDY,
THANKS FOR COMING OVER.

11:11.567 --> 11:13.433
- SURE, HOW'S IT GOING?
- GOOD, GOOD. LISTEN.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.900
I JUST GOT A COUPLE
MORE QUESTIONS

11:14.900 --> 11:16.100
ABOUT THIS JERRY MUSSO THING.

11:16.100 --> 11:17.300
- OH, GOD.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.067
YOU SAID
YOU HAD SOMETHING FOR ME.

11:19.067 --> 11:22.100
- YES, A COUPLE MORE
QUESTIONS.

11:22.100 --> 11:23.767
- RAY, PLEASE,
YOU'RE KILLING ME.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.600
YOU WERE ON THE PHONE
WITH ME ALL NIGHT.

11:25.600 --> 11:26.800
- YOU WERE?

11:26.800 --> 11:28.067
- YOU WERE ASLEEP.

11:28.067 --> 11:29.400
- SO WAS I!

11:29.400 --> 11:30.767
- LOOK, JUST TELL ME.

11:30.767 --> 11:33.067
- LISTEN, RAY,
WHO CARES WHAT HE THINKS?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.433
I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING.

11:34.433 --> 11:36.367
I FOUND OUT
HE'S A MAJOR LEAGUE SCUZBALL.

11:36.367 --> 11:37.633
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

11:37.633 --> 11:39.267
- THE OTHER DAY,
A GUY AT THE STATION

11:39.267 --> 11:41.433
WAS SELLING CANDY
FOR HIS KID'S SCHOOL,

11:41.433 --> 11:43.533
AND JERRY SAID, "I CAN'T.
I'M ALLERGIC TO CHOCOLATE."

11:43.533 --> 11:48.233
AND I HAVE THE FEELING
THAT HE ISN'T.

11:50.133 --> 11:53.067
- YEAH, RAY, LISTEN, DON'T GIVE
THIS GUY ANOTHER THOUGHT.

11:53.067 --> 11:56.800
YOU ARE SURROUNDED
BY PEOPLE WHO LOVE YOU.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.900
KIDS, COME ON IN HERE.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.100
LET'S GIVE DADDY
A BIG HUG, HUH?

12:01.100 --> 12:02.333
AND SHOW HIM HOW MUCH
WE LOVE HIM.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.833
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

12:03.833 --> 12:06.533
OKAY, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.

12:06.533 --> 12:08.333
- YOU'RE THE BEST DAD
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.167
- OH, I LOVE YOU, TOO, GEOFFREY.

12:10.167 --> 12:12.667
I LOVE ALL OF YOU.

12:12.667 --> 12:14.100
- AWWW.
- OKAY.

12:14.100 --> 12:15.500
- RAYGULA.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.367
- ALL RIGHT.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.600
- OKAY.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.267
MY WORK IS DONE HERE.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:20.267 --> 12:21.967
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

12:21.967 --> 12:24.067
- THEY'RE HAVING
A PREMIERE PARTY FOR THE SHOW.

12:24.067 --> 12:25.233
- DADDY, WANT TO PLAY
WITH ME?

12:25.233 --> 12:26.433
- JUST A MINUTE.

12:26.433 --> 12:27.833
THE JERRY MUSSO SHOW?

12:27.833 --> 12:29.067
- YEAH.

12:29.067 --> 12:30.267
- WELL, WELL, HOLD IT.

12:30.267 --> 12:31.467
- RAY?
- YEAH?

12:31.467 --> 12:33.067
OKAY, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
IN A MINUTE.

12:33.067 --> 12:34.700
LISTEN, CAN YOU GET ME IN, ANDY?

12:34.700 --> 12:35.967
- I SUPPOSE I COULD, BUT--

12:35.967 --> 12:37.600
- RAY,
GEOFFREY ASKED YOU IF--

12:37.600 --> 12:39.633
- GEOFFREY, DADDY'S GONNA BE
RIGHT BACK, OKAY?

12:39.633 --> 12:41.467
AND IF I'M NOT BACK
BY THE TIME YOU GO TO BED,

12:41.467 --> 12:43.633
THEN WE'RE GONNA PLAY
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.

12:43.633 --> 12:45.733
I PROMISE, OKAY?

12:47.400 --> 12:51.800
AND HERE IS A LITTLE ADVANCE
ON YOUR ALLOWANCE.

12:51.800 --> 12:55.500
GET YOURSELF SOME CANDY
OR SODAS, ANYTHING YOU WANT.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.633
OKAY?

12:57.633 --> 13:00.667
- YAY!

13:00.667 --> 13:03.133
- I LOVE YOU!
LET'S GO.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.600
- THANKS FOR GETTING ME IN.

13:23.600 --> 13:24.900
- YEAH, SURE.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.567
WHILE WE'RE HERE,
I CAN'T TALK TO YOU.

13:27.567 --> 13:29.133
I CAN'T BE SEEN
WITH YOU.

13:29.133 --> 13:31.333
AND IF ANYBODY ASKS,
I DON'T KNOW YOU

13:31.333 --> 13:34.933
AND I'VE NEVER HAD ANYTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

13:34.933 --> 13:38.667
- YOU'RE A TRUE FRIEND.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.600
HEY, HEY,
THAT'S JERRY MUSSO, RIGHT?

13:41.600 --> 13:44.567
- OH, CRAP.
GIVE ME A FIVE COUNT.

13:57.233 --> 13:58.933
- HEY, GIVE ME A...

13:58.933 --> 14:01.200
GIVE ME A...

14:01.200 --> 14:04.400
GIVE ME A GINGER ALE, PLEASE.

14:04.400 --> 14:10.100
- WELL, WELL,
LOOK WHO IT IS.

14:10.100 --> 14:11.300
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:11.300 --> 14:13.333
- ANDY GOT ME
ON THE GUEST LIST

14:13.333 --> 14:14.633
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO.

14:14.633 --> 14:17.867
I WANTED TO GET
JERRY MUSSO'S AUTOGRAPH.

14:17.867 --> 14:20.400
I'M A BIG FAN.

14:22.733 --> 14:25.067
- [snorting loudly]

14:28.833 --> 14:31.267
THANK YOU.

14:35.833 --> 14:38.600
- IT'S TEARING YOU APART,
ISN'T IT, HUH?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.567
YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

14:40.567 --> 14:42.633
WELL, THERE HE IS.
GO AHEAD.

14:42.633 --> 14:43.833
NOW'S YOUR CHANCE.

14:43.833 --> 14:46.800
MAYBE YOU'LL FIND OUT SOMETHING
ABOUT YOURSELF.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.733
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?

14:59.733 --> 15:02.467
- NOW, I'VE CHOSEN TO TAKE IT
AS A COMPLIMENT,

15:02.467 --> 15:04.267
BUT WHAT CAN YOU SAY
WHEN SOMEONE SAYS

15:04.267 --> 15:06.600
THAT YOU HAVE A FACE
THAT'S MADE FOR RADIO?

15:06.600 --> 15:10.067
- [laughs awkwardly]

15:10.067 --> 15:11.200
- JERRY?

15:11.200 --> 15:12.933
- YES.
- RAY BARONE.

15:12.933 --> 15:14.200
- OH, YES.
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.567
- GOOD, GOOD.

15:15.567 --> 15:17.233
I DON'T BELIEVE
WE'VE EVER MET, HAVE WE?

15:17.233 --> 15:19.367
- NO, I DON'T BELIEVE WE HAVE.

15:19.367 --> 15:21.667
- WELL, I JUST WANT TO SAY,
YOU KNOW, CONGRATULATIONS

15:21.667 --> 15:23.067
ON THE NEW SHOW.

15:23.067 --> 15:24.567
- THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

15:24.567 --> 15:26.667
OH, THIS IS MY STATION MANAGER,
TIM LEBOWSKY.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.667
- HEY.

15:28.667 --> 15:30.067
UM, A FUNNY THING.

15:30.067 --> 15:31.833
I HAD HEARD--

15:31.833 --> 15:34.133
AND I KNOW HOW THINGS
GET BLOWN OUT OF PROPORTION

15:34.133 --> 15:38.800
AND STUFF GETS MISCONSTRUED,
WHATEVER.

15:38.800 --> 15:41.133
I HAD HEARD THAT--

15:41.133 --> 15:44.933
SOMEBODY TOLD ME THAT YOU...

15:44.933 --> 15:46.433
HATED ME.

15:46.433 --> 15:48.500
[laughs]

15:48.500 --> 15:49.733
- WHAT?

15:49.733 --> 15:50.933
- "HATE," YEAH.

15:50.933 --> 15:52.433
THAT WAS THE WORD, "HATE,"

15:52.433 --> 15:54.767
WHICH SEEMED ODD TO ME
BECAUSE WE HAD NEVER MET.

15:54.767 --> 15:57.267
I MEAN, I HAVE MY FAULTS,
LIKE ANYBODY ELSE,

15:57.267 --> 15:59.367
BUT I THINK
ONCE YOU GET TO KNOW ME, I--

15:59.367 --> 16:01.300
YOU KNOW,
IT'S LIKE MY MOTHER SAYS,

16:01.300 --> 16:04.100
IT'S--I...

16:04.100 --> 16:06.600
WELL, ANYWAY, I JUST,
I DON'T KNOW.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.733
I WAS WONDERING.

16:08.733 --> 16:10.433
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:10.433 --> 16:14.267
WHY--
WHY WOULD I HATE YOU?

16:14.267 --> 16:15.933
- THAT'S WHAT I SAID.

16:15.933 --> 16:18.300
- WELL, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
I DON'T HATE YOU.

16:18.300 --> 16:21.267
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

16:27.067 --> 16:28.700
I REALLY--

16:28.700 --> 16:30.833
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE YOU COULD'VE GOT THAT.

16:30.833 --> 16:34.800
IN FACT,
YOU SHOULD DO MY SHOW.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.400
WOULD YOU DO MY SHOW?

16:36.400 --> 16:38.067
- YES, YES.
THAT WOULD BE GREAT!

16:38.067 --> 16:40.500
- OKAY, WHERE'S ANDY? ANDY!

16:40.500 --> 16:41.800
ANDY!

16:41.800 --> 16:43.367
- HEY, WHAT'S UP, JER?

16:43.367 --> 16:45.767
- HEY, ANDY, THIS IS RAY BARONE,
NEW YORK NEWSDAY.

16:45.767 --> 16:47.067
- HOW DO YOU DO?

16:47.067 --> 16:48.433
RAY, IS IT?

16:48.433 --> 16:49.800
- YEAH.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.833
- HOW COME YOU HAVEN'T BOOKED
RAY ON THE SHOW?

16:51.833 --> 16:53.267
I MEAN, HE'D BE GREAT.

16:53.267 --> 16:55.067
- YOU KNOW, I KNEW THIS
WAS JUST SOME KIND OF

16:55.067 --> 16:56.233
BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

16:56.233 --> 16:57.533
- OH, SURE, SURE.

16:57.533 --> 16:58.933
WELL, LISTEN, ENJOY YOURSELF,

16:58.933 --> 17:00.233
AND IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:00.233 --> 17:01.400
- WELL, YOU TOO, THANKS.

17:01.400 --> 17:03.067
THANKS, JERRY.
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.233
- SAME HERE, RAY.
- OKAY.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.667
[chuckles sheepishly]

17:05.667 --> 17:07.400
- WHAT? WHAT?

17:07.400 --> 17:08.600
- HUH?

17:08.600 --> 17:09.767
- NOTHING.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.700
IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU ROLLED YOUR EYES THERE.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.367
- I DID?

17:13.367 --> 17:14.600
- YEAH.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.600
I MEAN, YOU MEANT
WHAT YOU SAID JUST NOW?

17:16.600 --> 17:18.067
- OH, SURE, SURE.

17:18.067 --> 17:19.867
LISTEN, YOU'RE ON THE SHOW.
I'LL SEE YOU THERE.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.600
- NO, NO, I KNOW YOU SAID
YOU DIDN'T HATE ME,

17:21.600 --> 17:24.067
BUT IT KIND OF LOOKED LIKE
YOU JUST WENT LIKE THIS...

17:24.067 --> 17:25.367
AND I THINK I KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.733
MY WIFE DOES THAT
TO ME ALL THE TIME.

17:27.733 --> 17:30.233
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

17:30.233 --> 17:32.233
IT'S, LIKE,
"CAN YOU BELIEVE THIS GUY?"

17:32.233 --> 17:36.100
YOU KNOW, BUT IF THAT'S NOT
WHAT YOU DID, THEN THAT'S FINE.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.433
- LOOK, WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME?

17:39.433 --> 17:41.733
- SO IT'S TRUE.
YOU DO HATE ME?

17:41.733 --> 17:44.667
- MAN, YOU OUGHT TO LEARN
TO QUIT WHILE YOU'RE AHEAD.

17:44.667 --> 17:46.600
- WELL, HEY, NO.
I MEAN, IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.700
I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHY.

17:49.700 --> 17:52.700
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU HAVE TO PUSH IT, OKAY.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.533
WELL, THERE'S JUST
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU.

17:54.533 --> 17:56.500
I'VE READ YOUR COLUMN.
I'VE HEARD YOU SPEAK.

17:56.500 --> 18:01.133
I LOOK AT YOU, AND I GO,
"I DON'T GET IT."

18:01.133 --> 18:03.067
I GUESS
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SMART

18:03.067 --> 18:04.833
TO HAVE A CAREER
IN THIS BUSINESS.

18:04.833 --> 18:07.333
NOW, IF YOU KNOW ME, YOU KNOW
I HAVE PRETTY HIGH STANDARDS

18:07.333 --> 18:12.500
AND A VERY
LOW THRESHOLD FOR DUMB.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.533
LOOK, I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT,
I WAS TRYING TO BE NICE,

18:14.533 --> 18:16.467
BUT YOU WOULDN'T LET IT GO.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.233
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST GO
HAVE A SHRIMP PUFF

18:18.233 --> 18:20.233
AND LEAVE ME ALONE, OKAY?

18:25.733 --> 18:29.833
- HOLD IT RIGHT THERE,
YOU LITTLE TWERP.

18:29.833 --> 18:31.733
- WHO ARE YOU?

18:31.733 --> 18:33.533
- WHO AM I?

18:33.533 --> 18:36.233
I'M SOMEONE WHO CAN CRUSH YOU
INTO A FINE POWDER,

18:36.233 --> 18:38.533
THAT'S WHO I AM.

18:42.367 --> 18:45.300
NOW, RAY BARONE HAS MORE TALENT

18:45.300 --> 18:47.267
IN THE WEIRD PIMPLE
ON HIS NECK

18:47.267 --> 18:50.433
THAT WON'T GO AWAY

18:50.433 --> 18:53.133
THAN YOU HAVE
IN YOUR ENTIRE BODY,

18:53.133 --> 18:56.300
YOU OILY,
TWO-FACED HACK.

18:56.300 --> 18:57.867
YOU ONLY WISH
YOU COULD BE RAY BARONE,

18:57.867 --> 19:00.067
BECAUSE YOU'LL NEVER
COME CLOSE TO HIM

19:00.067 --> 19:01.900
AS A WRITER, AS A FATHER,

19:01.900 --> 19:03.133
AS A FRIEND,

19:03.133 --> 19:05.300
OR AS A PERSON.

19:16.267 --> 19:18.333
COME ON, RAYMOND.

19:22.567 --> 19:24.733
- HEY, WHO LET
THOSE GUYS IN HERE?

19:24.733 --> 19:26.167
- I DON'T KNOW,

19:26.167 --> 19:28.200
BUT I'M SURE AS HELL
GONNA FIND OUT.

19:31.067 --> 19:33.267
- HEY, YOU KNOW,
THANKS.

19:33.267 --> 19:35.733
- YEAH, YEAH.

19:35.733 --> 19:37.167
- GUY CALLED ME DUMB.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.367
- YOU'RE NOT DUMB, RAYMOND.

19:39.367 --> 19:42.067
- I MEAN, EVEN IF I AM, IS THAT
ANY REASON TO HATE ME?

19:42.067 --> 19:44.267
- OF COURSE NOT.

19:44.267 --> 19:47.767
THERE'S SO MANY BETTER REASONS.

19:47.767 --> 19:49.867
- HEY, BY THE WAY,
THAT'S NOT A PIMPLE, ALL RIGHT?

19:49.867 --> 19:51.767
THAT'S AN INGROWN HAIR.

19:51.767 --> 19:53.833
- WELL, IT'S WEIRD,
AND IT WON'T GO AWAY.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.100
- I KNOW.

20:00.100 --> 20:03.833
- DEB.

20:03.833 --> 20:06.133
DEB.

20:06.133 --> 20:08.300
- HMM?

20:08.300 --> 20:11.467
- DO YOU THINK I'M DUMB?

20:12.700 --> 20:18.833
- YOU'VE ASKED ME
THIS BEFORE.

20:18.833 --> 20:22.567
- I GUESS I FORGOT WHAT YOU SAID
'CAUSE I'M DUMB.

20:25.900 --> 20:29.600
- NO, RAY, YOU'RE NOT DUMB.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.400
- REALLY?

20:31.400 --> 20:34.500
- YOU'RE NEUROTIC,
BUT YOU'RE NOT DUMB.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.100
I WOULDN'T BE MARRIED
TO A DUMB GUY.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.667
- YOU CALL ME "IDIOT."

20:41.667 --> 20:43.233
- COME ON.

20:43.233 --> 20:45.133
THAT'S JUST MY LITTLE, UM...

20:45.133 --> 20:48.133
NICKNAME FOR YOU.

20:48.133 --> 20:50.600
YOU'RE NOT AN IDIOT.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.433
- SO WHAT IS IT?

20:52.433 --> 20:54.633
IT'S LIKE THAT--
LIKE AN OPPOSITE NICKNAME,

20:54.633 --> 20:56.800
YOU KNOW, LIKE SOMEONE
WHO NEVER SMILES,

20:56.800 --> 20:59.800
YOU CALL 'EM "SMILEY"?

20:59.800 --> 21:03.367
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

21:09.067 --> 21:13.200
NIGHT.

21:13.200 --> 21:17.067
- GOOD NIGHT,
SKINNY.

21:18.967 --> 21:21.467
'CAUSE THAT'S NOT
AN OPPOSITE NICKNAME.

21:21.467 --> 21:24.700
MY NICKNAMES
MEAN EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAY.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.233
IF YOU WANT
AN OPPOSITE NICKNAME,

21:26.233 --> 21:30.900
THEN,
HI, CHUBBY.

21:30.900 --> 21:33.500
I DON'T KNOW, I...

21:33.500 --> 21:34.800
[sighs]

21:34.800 --> 21:37.067
I AM AN IDIOT.
