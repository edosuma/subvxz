00:13.000 --> 00:15.067

-Stop! Now! Stop!

00:18.967 --> 00:21.033
-(clattering)
-Heads up!

00:21.067 --> 00:23.533
-* Bad boys, bad boys,
whatcha gonna do... *

00:23.567 --> 00:25.967
I smoked some marijuana!
I'm a marijuana smoker!

00:26.000 --> 00:27.833
-* Bad boys, bad boys *
-Crawl out!

00:27.867 --> 00:29.233
* Whatcha gonna do... *

00:29.267 --> 00:30.467
-Hands up! Hands up!

00:30.500 --> 00:32.367
Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it! Hold it!

00:32.400 --> 00:34.433
-Announcer:
"Cops" is filmed on location

00:34.467 --> 00:36.533
with the men and women
of law enforcement.

00:36.567 --> 00:39.100
All suspects are innocent
until proven guilty

00:39.133 --> 00:42.033
in a court of law.

00:42.067 --> 00:44.833
-I was a, uh, police officer
for about twelve
and a half years

00:44.867 --> 00:49.433
at the Colton Police Department,
which is about, uh, 10 miles
east of here.

00:49.467 --> 00:51.733
But I had a lot of friends
who worked here at Fontana

00:51.767 --> 00:55.267
and told me about how great
Fontana PD was, how much
they loved workin' here.

00:55.300 --> 00:58.633
So I applied here at Fontana
and, uh, got hired.

00:58.667 --> 01:00.467
Having so many friends
and colleagues here

01:00.500 --> 01:02.067
made it a super easy
transition for me

01:02.100 --> 01:05.400
to come
to a brand-new department.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.667
We're gonna check this guy
on a bike.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.400
He's, uh, riding around
blacked out.

01:08.433 --> 01:11.067
This neighborhood has been
getting hit pretty hard
for, uh, vehicle burglaries.

01:11.067 --> 01:13.133
We'll see what he's up to.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.333
-Man: What's up?

01:17.367 --> 01:19.467
-(siren chirps)

01:21.500 --> 01:24.567
-Entry-Seven-Gus,
subject taking off on a bike.

01:24.600 --> 01:27.700
Laurel, south of Merrill.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.900
-Woman (over radio):
Copy. Laurel, south of Merrill.

01:31.500 --> 01:35.900
-Hispanic male, black shirt,
blue baseball hat.

01:35.933 --> 01:40.067
-Woman (over radio):
Copy. Hispanic male,
black shirt, blue baseball hat.

01:40.067 --> 01:42.467
-Passing Hibiscus.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.067
-Woman (over radio):
Copy. Passing Hibiscus.

01:44.067 --> 01:46.067
-(siren wailing)

01:57.467 --> 02:00.167
-Westbound on Athol.

02:00.200 --> 02:03.533
-Woman (over radio):
Copy. Westbound, Athol.
(indistinct)

02:03.567 --> 02:05.433
-(indistinct
radio transmission)

02:05.467 --> 02:06.933
-Woman (over radio):
All right, Seven, copy.

02:18.700 --> 02:20.767
-Southbound through yards.

02:20.800 --> 02:22.200
-(metallic clattering)

02:24.167 --> 02:26.467
-(man grunts)
-Stop, police!

02:27.700 --> 02:29.433
Get on the ground!
-(man groaning)

02:29.467 --> 02:30.867
-Get on the ground!
-(shouts indistinctly)

02:30.900 --> 02:32.300
-Put your hands out!
-(shouts)

02:32.333 --> 02:33.567
-Get your hands
behind your back!

02:33.600 --> 02:35.100
-All right, I'm--
-Put your hands
behind your back!

02:35.133 --> 02:36.600
-I'm trying!

02:36.633 --> 02:38.167
-Got one resisting
in the backyard.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.533
-(groans)
-Get your hand
behind your back!

02:41.900 --> 02:43.500
Put your other hand back.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.700
-Hey, my--
-Put your other hand back.

02:49.567 --> 02:51.067
-Do you have any weapons on you?
-No, I don't.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.867
-Anything that's gonna
poke me or stick me?

02:52.900 --> 02:54.833
-No.
-Was that a gun that you threw
right there?

02:54.867 --> 02:58.067
-No.
-No? I saw you throw it.

02:58.100 --> 03:00.900
What's your name?
-Andrew.

03:00.933 --> 03:02.100
-Long time, no see, man.

03:02.133 --> 03:03.833
-Who's that?
-Bermudez.

03:03.867 --> 03:05.500
-What's up, Bermudez?
-Stand up.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.133
Haven't seen you
since the Colton days.

03:07.167 --> 03:10.800
-(both panting)

03:10.833 --> 03:13.433
-Hey, dude?
-X-ray-Seven, I'm Code 4,
with one in custody.

03:13.467 --> 03:15.233
And he tossed a gun.

03:15.267 --> 03:16.900
Looks like he tossed a gun
right here.

03:16.933 --> 03:18.833
Are you on parole
right now?
-Yeah, dude.

03:18.867 --> 03:22.067
-Yeah? Just have a seat
right here.

03:22.100 --> 03:26.600
-(panting)
-What are you on parole for
right now?

03:26.633 --> 03:28.367
-Assault, I think.
-Assault?

03:28.400 --> 03:30.933
-Yeah.

03:30.967 --> 03:33.233
-Why'd you run, man?

03:33.267 --> 03:36.300
-You know, man.
-Didn't wanna get caught
with the gun?

03:37.967 --> 03:40.467
-I saw you toss it,
I seen it right there,
you know what I'm sayin'?

03:40.500 --> 03:42.200
It is what it is.
-I know, sir.

03:42.233 --> 03:46.467
What's up? Hey, Bermudez,
so we can fix (bleep)?

03:46.500 --> 03:48.533
-What do you mean?

03:48.567 --> 03:50.633
Dude, you're not as fast
as you used to be, bro.

03:50.667 --> 03:52.200
-I know.
-You used to be damn fast.

03:52.233 --> 03:54.067
-I was tired from
that damn bike right now.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.367
-I remember when you used
to, like, run across, like,
barbed wire fences and stuff.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.167
-Damn, dude!
(bleep)

04:00.200 --> 04:03.433
-We were getting ready,
we were on Pine. We were like,
"Oh, we can go this way."

04:03.467 --> 04:05.333
-Copy that.

04:05.367 --> 04:07.867
Can you grab him real quick,
so I can grab his gun and stuff?

04:07.900 --> 04:10.500
-Yeah.
Get up.

04:10.533 --> 04:12.533
-During the chase, I saw him
toss his gun here,

04:12.567 --> 04:14.900
and caught him as he, uh,
ran around the corner.

04:14.933 --> 04:18.100
Looks like it's a little
two-shot...

04:18.133 --> 04:21.133
little, uh...
small, old...

04:22.333 --> 04:25.233
little,
old piece of crap firearm.

04:25.267 --> 04:29.400
But this guy's on parole.
He's a known documented
gang member.

04:29.433 --> 04:33.700
So it looks like he's gonna
go to jail here for a felony
with a firearm.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.300
-He had this, too.
Had some extra ammo
stuffed in it.

04:36.333 --> 04:37.533
-Oh, on him?
-On his waistband, yeah.

04:37.567 --> 04:40.767
-Awesome.
Same caliber ammo?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.800
-38.
-Yeah, looks like it.

04:42.833 --> 04:46.733
-Yeah.
-Yeah, so it's an older firearm,
like a Derringer-style,

04:46.767 --> 04:50.567
and, uh, looks like
it might be havin' a little bit
of mechanical difficulties

04:50.600 --> 04:53.667
here, so we're gonna
load it up and make it safe
in this thing here.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.233
This is a little holster he had.

04:55.267 --> 04:57.733
He had a little holster
with some extra ammo
with him.

04:57.767 --> 05:00.433
Um, who knows
what his mission was
for tonight.

05:00.467 --> 05:03.133
But, uh, we're gonna
secure them back
in the car here,

05:03.167 --> 05:05.433
so we can take it over
to our, uh, range
at the station,

05:05.467 --> 05:09.400
and, you know,
safely clear it so no one
gets hurt with this thing.

05:09.433 --> 05:11.300
-(radio chatter)

05:13.733 --> 05:17.333
-I was (indistinct)...
on parole, I was like (bleep).
-Yeah.

05:17.367 --> 05:19.600
-Usually I get away
'cause I'm pretty fast,
you know what I'm sayin',

05:19.633 --> 05:20.833
but not tonight.

05:20.867 --> 05:23.333
I was tired from that damn bike,
so fast...

05:23.367 --> 05:25.567
-Yeah, you chose right
by not usin' that thing,
though, man.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.633
-I didn't have it
for that kind of (bleep),
you understand?

05:27.667 --> 05:31.700
I was just-- Oh!
Go in and dropped-- Aah!

05:31.733 --> 05:34.067
-So this is the guy
who ran from you guys
a couple weeks ago,

05:34.067 --> 05:35.833
over at the house
where all the tweakers
are stayin' at?

05:35.867 --> 05:37.733
-Yeah.
-Okay. You got some information
that it's possibly

05:37.767 --> 05:38.767
a guy named Frost?

05:38.800 --> 05:40.300
-Yeah.
-Cool. And it's him?

05:40.333 --> 05:42.467
-And the info was that
he had a gun on him.
-Cool.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.600
Awesome.
Sounds like the info
panned out.

05:44.633 --> 05:46.367
-Yeah.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.600
-Hey, Frost.
-What's up, bro?

05:47.633 --> 05:49.633
-Hey, real quick, man...
um, obviously

05:49.667 --> 05:51.733
you know the drill,
you been through this
a lot of times.

05:51.767 --> 05:54.633
You and I've known each other
you know, quite a few times.

05:54.667 --> 05:58.067
Um, what happened, bro?
Why didn't you just stop
when I tried to stop you?

05:58.067 --> 06:00.567
-'Cause I was kind of on parole,
and I didn't wanna--
know what I'm saying?

06:00.600 --> 06:01.867
-Right.
-I, um...

06:01.900 --> 06:04.333
-Nothin' personal
like that, but, uh--
-Yeah. For sure.

06:04.367 --> 06:05.867
-Um... yeah, I just--
know what I'm saying?

06:05.900 --> 06:08.900
I usually--
I'm usually pretty fast,
know what I'm sayin'?

06:08.933 --> 06:11.233
-Right.
-So I can get away,
but, uh, I guess not today.

06:11.267 --> 06:13.767
That (bleep) bike ride
had me tried.

06:13.800 --> 06:16.867
-(laughs)
Yeah, you were movin'
pretty good on the bike.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.367
I mean, obviously, you know
how it is, ex-con with a gun,
you know the rule.

06:19.400 --> 06:20.633
You know what I'm sayin'?

06:20.667 --> 06:23.267
So, um, you should make
better choices next time.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.067
-(sighs) I know, I know.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.500
-You don't wanna get
yourself hurt. Obviously,
one of us don't wanna get hurt.

06:27.533 --> 06:30.167
-So, what's gonna be my charges
besides the gun?

06:30.200 --> 06:31.533
-Felon with a firearm.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.367
And whatever you gotta
deal with with your parole.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.067
-All right, cool, thank you.
-Cool. All right, man.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.200
-Hey, sorry, my bad,
it's nothin' personal,
you understand?

06:37.233 --> 06:39.533
-I know, I understand.
I don't see it as personal.

06:39.567 --> 06:41.933
So, all right, we'll see you
back at the station, all right?

06:43.100 --> 06:44.567
Sarge, you were able
to get it open?

06:44.600 --> 06:47.167
-Yeah.
So, this is the release
right here.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.067
-Okay.
-There's light primer strikes.

06:49.100 --> 06:52.167
-Okay.
-So, somebody attempted
to fire this at some point,

06:52.200 --> 06:55.667
but it didn't go off.
-Okay. Fortunate
for that person.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.700
Uh, it's pretty crazy.
Found with a gun.

06:57.733 --> 06:59.367
Who knows
what his intentions
were tonight.

07:01.833 --> 07:04.067
-I'm born and raised here
in Lee County, Florida.

07:04.100 --> 07:07.133
Been with the Lee County
Sheriff's Office for just
under two years.

07:07.167 --> 07:10.467
I'm fortunate that Lee County
in southwest Florida

07:10.500 --> 07:13.633
has some
of the premier fishing spots
in the entire world.

07:13.667 --> 07:16.267
So you could say I'm lucky.
I get to do the job I love

07:16.300 --> 07:18.933
and be on the water.
-(radio chatter)

07:18.967 --> 07:22.800
We're goin' to a disturbance
right now between, uh,
a man and a woman.

07:22.833 --> 07:27.633
The woman is stating
that the husband is gettin'
a little... little crazy.

07:27.667 --> 07:31.900
But then she said
that he got a little crazy
and started hitting himself.

07:31.933 --> 07:33.833
So we'll see what's really
goin' on.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.067
-Hey, man, how's it going?
-Aah, could be better, brother.

07:45.067 --> 07:46.633
-You're not the one
who called?

07:46.667 --> 07:51.133
-Well, she called,
but she's tryin' to make it
sound like I was (bleep).

07:51.167 --> 07:52.933
And, I mean--
-Do you want me to have
an ambulance

07:52.967 --> 07:54.100
come and check you out?

07:54.133 --> 07:55.900
-No, I'm good, man. She--
-You sure?

07:55.933 --> 07:58.533
-Yeah. I mean, she was
tryin' to say that I beat
myself up,

07:58.567 --> 08:01.333
but look at my knu--
I didn't do anything, man.

08:01.367 --> 08:03.967
I didn't do anything to myself.
-You ain't got nothin'
on your knuckles.

08:04.067 --> 08:07.067
-She was hittin' me,
and I pushed her
just to get away,

08:07.067 --> 08:10.800
and then I came outside.
-Well, what were y'all
arguin' about?

08:10.833 --> 08:14.867
-I-- Some girl, that's been,
like, two months ago.

08:14.900 --> 08:16.933
It's been like two months now.

08:16.967 --> 08:20.500
And I guess she talked
to her, and the girl's
been sayin', like,

08:20.533 --> 08:22.467
well, we did this
and we did that.

08:22.500 --> 08:26.067
And this girl is a junkie,
and she's in New York now.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.600
-Okay.

08:27.633 --> 08:30.700
-She's just startin' to--
tryin' to start problems,
and obviously,

08:30.733 --> 08:32.933
it started problems.
-Right.

08:32.967 --> 08:34.833
-You know.
-So she's just bringin' up
the past right now.

08:34.867 --> 08:38.233
-Yeah!
And she jumped on my ass,
and I just tried to...

08:38.267 --> 08:42.600
push her, and she did
fall into the TV, but I just
wanted to get outside.

08:42.633 --> 08:44.367
You know what I'm sayin'?
-Okay, when I talk to her,

08:44.400 --> 08:46.100
she's gonna somewhat tell me
the same sort of thing?

08:46.133 --> 08:48.500
-I'm tellin' you right now,
she ain't got no marks on her,

08:48.533 --> 08:51.467
'cause I just pushed away,
just to get the hell outside.
-Okay.

08:51.500 --> 08:53.767
-And I came over here
with my neighbor.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.400
And I've been sittin' here
ever since.

08:55.433 --> 08:58.267
-Is your neighbor still here?
-Yeah, he's sittin'--
He's inside.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.467
-He's inside? Okay.
-Yeah.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.233
-Do you live here with her?
-Yeah.

09:01.267 --> 09:04.067
-Okay. Do me a favor?
Go ahead and just go over
to my front bumper, okay?

09:04.100 --> 09:05.433
-No problem.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.833
-Hey, Kelly.
Tell me what's goin' on tonight.

09:07.867 --> 09:10.067
-He's been cheating.
-You found him cheating?

09:10.067 --> 09:12.133
-Yeah.
-How'd you find out?
Was there, like, a text message?

09:12.167 --> 09:15.133
-Um, the girl,
the girl called me. Yeah.
-Oh, really? Okay.

09:15.167 --> 09:19.700
-And then, um, I took
a Valentine card that I got him,

09:19.733 --> 09:22.200
that was supposed to be
really special...

09:22.233 --> 09:23.533
(crying)

09:23.567 --> 09:25.400
-Okay?
-...and I ripped it up,
and I said,

09:25.433 --> 09:30.467
"This means nothing."
And he got up, and he took,
like, here, and he shoved me

09:30.500 --> 09:34.600
into the TV.
And the-- And the--
He broke the TV.

09:34.633 --> 09:36.133
-You were pushed into it?
-Yeah.

09:36.167 --> 09:40.333
-And right as soon
as I said I'm calling 9-1-1,
he had his fists,

09:40.367 --> 09:42.467
and he was going
back and forth just like that.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.233
-Do you mind showing me
your knuckles? You don't have
any marks or anything on them?

09:45.267 --> 09:47.800
-No.
-Okay.

09:47.833 --> 09:49.467
There was no one else here
to witness any of that?

09:49.500 --> 09:53.133
-No.
-Well, we gotta get down
to the bottom of it.

09:53.167 --> 09:56.067
-He's-- he's bleedin'.
-I didn't do that.

09:56.100 --> 09:57.467
-Okay, well...
-He did that to himself.

09:57.500 --> 09:59.167
-Someone did,
and he's saying
that you did it.

09:59.200 --> 10:01.133
-I did not.
-So we have to get down
to the bottom of it.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.667
Do you know in Florida,
there's-- domestic violence
is taken very, very seriously.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.633
-I understand,
and I didn't do it.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.567
-So you're the one
that called me here,
and since I'm here,

10:08.600 --> 10:11.800
I have to investigate, okay?
-I wouldn't have called you
if I hit him.

10:11.833 --> 10:15.200
-Fair enough.
Most people don't wanna
get themselves in trouble.

10:15.233 --> 10:18.133
Well, let me go
talk to him, we'll find out
what's goin' on, okay?

10:19.300 --> 10:21.600
Hey, Brian, you doin' okay?
-I'm all right.

10:21.633 --> 10:23.567
-Okay.

10:23.600 --> 10:25.433
Hey, man, this is a little--
a little puzzlin'.

10:25.467 --> 10:28.067
You're tellin' me
one thing, now she's
tellin' me somethin'

10:28.100 --> 10:30.000
somewhat different.
She's sayin' you were
hittin' yourself.

10:30.033 --> 10:33.100
-Oh...
-Now let me be honest
with you, okay?

10:33.133 --> 10:36.400
If you're sayin' she hit you
and we have evidence
of her hittin' you,

10:36.433 --> 10:39.233
I'm gonna have to take
her to jail under Florida
domestic violence.

10:39.267 --> 10:42.667
Based off what you're gonna
tell me right now, is gonna
determine what's gonna happen,

10:42.700 --> 10:44.133
okay?
-Yeah.

10:44.167 --> 10:46.000
-So I want you
to be aware, okay?
I'm tryin' to help you out

10:46.033 --> 10:47.133
right now.
-No, I understand.

10:47.167 --> 10:49.100
-So if somethin' different
happened, now is--

10:49.133 --> 10:51.000
-That's what happened,
but I don't want her
to go to jail.

10:51.033 --> 10:52.700
-Go ahead and wait right there.

10:54.267 --> 10:55.667
-Hey, Kelly.
-Sir?

10:55.700 --> 10:58.300
-Go ahead and put your hands
behind your back. Turn around.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.933
-Wait. Turn around,
or I don't--
-Yes, turn around,

11:01.967 --> 11:04.967
put your hands behind your back.
-I didn't know which way
you were talkin' about, sorry.

11:05.067 --> 11:08.833
-Okay. What's gonna happen is,
you're gonna go to jail tonight.
-All right.

11:08.867 --> 11:11.067
-You're gonna
be charged with battery,
just simple battery,

11:11.067 --> 11:13.333
but it's gonna be
domestic violence, so there's
gonna be an injunction

11:13.367 --> 11:14.533
put in place, okay?

11:14.567 --> 11:17.067
-I didn't punch anybody
in the face. Oh my God.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.600
-Come out here with me, okay?
-I can't believe he keeps
getting away with this.

11:19.633 --> 11:21.833
-Do you have anything else
on you or anything
I need to know about?

11:21.867 --> 11:23.100
-No.
-Okay.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.767
Just go ahead
and take a seat, okay?

11:30.367 --> 11:32.300
I got you, watch your head.

11:34.833 --> 11:36.067
Okay.

11:38.800 --> 11:41.867
-Okay.
-You wanna talk to her
any-- any bit

11:41.900 --> 11:43.433
before...
-I'd like to.

11:43.467 --> 11:45.967
-...I get her outta here.
You'd like to.

11:46.067 --> 11:48.567
I just wanna give you
the opportunity to talk
to her this one last time,

11:48.600 --> 11:51.633
because it's not--
you two are not supposed
to speak until the court case

11:51.667 --> 11:53.067
and everything
is handled, okay?

11:53.100 --> 11:55.133
-Okay.
-Just go and walk over here,
I'll open the door, okay?

11:55.167 --> 11:56.167
-Yeah.

12:03.667 --> 12:05.167
-Honey...
-(sobs)

12:05.200 --> 12:08.733
-When are you ever
gonna realize that
all I want is you?

12:08.767 --> 12:11.867
-You lie, Brian. She sent me
all your text messages.

12:11.900 --> 12:14.967
-Fifteen years I've been
with you, and you've been
accusing me

12:15.067 --> 12:17.633
because your ex-husband
(bleep) around on you.

12:17.667 --> 12:21.933
Fifteen years
you've been accusing me.
You admitted it to me!

12:21.967 --> 12:24.200
I finally do it.

12:24.233 --> 12:27.200
I finally go out and do it...

12:27.233 --> 12:28.900
-You said you were falling
in love with her.

12:28.933 --> 12:31.333
-Oh...
-I have the text messages.
I saw them.

12:31.367 --> 12:32.867
-Whatever. All right.

12:32.900 --> 12:36.900
The only reason I even called,
was because her friend

12:36.933 --> 12:39.633
begged me to call her...
-I don't wanna talk anymore.

12:39.667 --> 12:41.433
-...and find out
what she was doing.

12:41.467 --> 12:44.500
The heroin, she's on heroin,
and she's doin' crack,

12:44.533 --> 12:46.333
and she's doin'
all kinds of (bleep).

12:46.367 --> 12:48.067
I was just tryin'
to make sure...
-Brian--

12:48.067 --> 12:50.400
-...she was okay.
Kelly--

12:50.433 --> 12:52.600
-All right, buddy, let's go.
Let's not berate her.

12:52.633 --> 12:54.367
-No, I know, I'm just--
-Let's leave it as is, okay?

12:54.400 --> 12:55.867
-I love her to death.
-I understand,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.367
-but she doesn't
wanna talk anymore, okay?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.533
So we're gonna end it
at that, okay?

13:00.567 --> 13:04.267
-All right.
-Love is a strong thing.
It puts people through a lot,

13:04.300 --> 13:08.867
but it can put people
through a lot of negative
things, too.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.700
-I've been with the Fort Myers
Police Department

13:10.733 --> 13:12.567
for approximately two years now.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.533
I enjoy working with the people
that I work with every day

13:14.567 --> 13:16.467
and, uh, making sure
that they make it home

13:16.500 --> 13:19.400
at the end of the day,
but you also, uh--

13:19.433 --> 13:20.900
it's really rewarding
getting out there,

13:20.933 --> 13:22.733
and you get that one
"thank you" a day from somebody

13:22.767 --> 13:25.133
in the community that really
appreciates what you do,

13:25.167 --> 13:27.900
and, uh, it makes everything
worth it, helping
those people out.

13:29.333 --> 13:33.233
Delta 600, 1-73...
(indistinct)

13:33.267 --> 13:37.067
So, this car is, uh, parked
at the end of the pier
right now.

13:37.100 --> 13:40.067
It's way past hours.
The park is closed.

13:40.067 --> 13:42.333
We're gonna check out
and see what they're doin'
up here.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.833
Hi, I'm Officer Carter,
Fort Myers Police Department.

13:51.867 --> 13:54.200
The reason I'm talkin'
to you guys is because the park
is closed.

13:54.233 --> 13:56.200
-You can't be out here.
-Oh. The park's closed?

13:56.233 --> 13:59.367
I didn't know that.
-Do you guys have
your IDs on you?

13:59.400 --> 14:01.667
-How y'all doin' this morning?
-Good, how are you?

14:01.700 --> 14:04.833
-Doin' good.
I didn't know we weren't
allowed to be up here.

14:04.867 --> 14:06.967
-You guys have anything illegal
or anything like that
in the car?

14:07.067 --> 14:09.067
-No.
-Are you sure about that?

14:09.067 --> 14:10.633
-Yeah, why?
-All right.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.367
Here's all your--
your stuff back.

14:12.400 --> 14:14.667
-Okay.
-Um, do you mind
if I search the car?

14:14.700 --> 14:17.800
-You wanna search the car?

14:17.833 --> 14:19.567
Why do you need
to search the car?

14:19.600 --> 14:20.833
-I'm asking you.

14:23.567 --> 14:26.533
-I mean...
there's no weapons, but...

14:26.567 --> 14:28.167
-There's no weapons,
but what?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.200
-I'm just sayin'
I don't know why you guys
need to search the car.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.400
-Well, I'm asking you.
-It's not my car.

14:32.433 --> 14:34.767
-Who's car is it?
-It's a friend of mine car's.

14:34.800 --> 14:36.633
-Grab the registration
for me?

14:36.667 --> 14:39.833
-It's yellow, baby.
-It's yellow, that's what
I thought.

14:39.867 --> 14:41.400
-There's a little shake.

14:41.433 --> 14:43.367
-Hm? Yeah, I was gonna say,
there's-- there's shake
down there.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.700
-It's, uh-- It's not yellow.
It's not yellow.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.367
-It's-- It's white.
-It's white, right?

14:47.400 --> 14:48.867
-I smelled it.
-I see it.

14:48.900 --> 14:51.067
-You see it?
-No.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.233
-You see the regis--

14:55.600 --> 14:58.667
-There's an ashtray
on the top, a portable ashtray.

14:58.700 --> 15:00.600
-All right, do me
a favor, ma'am?

15:00.633 --> 15:02.433
Step out of the car for me?

15:02.467 --> 15:04.367
-Oy-yoy-yoy.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.600
-Step to the back
of the-- Step to the right
here for me.

15:06.633 --> 15:08.900
Do you have
anything on you...
-Can I get my jacket?

15:08.933 --> 15:10.867
-Yeah, I'll-- I'll let it--
I'll let you get it
in a second.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.267
Do you have anything on you?
-No, I don't.

15:12.300 --> 15:13.767
-All right.
Turn around, face the car
for me.

15:15.067 --> 15:16.667
I saw marijuana shake
on the ground.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.867
So I'm gonna search the car.
See if I can't find
anything else.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.133
Well, there's some marijuana.

15:26.067 --> 15:28.200
There's marijuana
in this cup right here.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.300
There's a decent amount
of, um, marijuana.

15:37.467 --> 15:39.300
Hey, you can detain them.

15:39.333 --> 15:43.300
-You know how long it's been
since I had on some damn
handcuffs over a damn show?

15:43.333 --> 15:45.167
Oh, this is crazy.

15:45.200 --> 15:48.200
-Well, you have handcuffs
on over the marijuana
that's in the car,

15:48.233 --> 15:49.467
that's what you have handcuffs
on for.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.800
-For marijuana in the car?
-Yes.

15:53.967 --> 15:57.233
The driver of the car has priors
for selling marijuana.

15:57.267 --> 16:02.167
Um, I mean, she's got
a bag of marijuana here.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.433
She's got the scale
that has the marijuana
on it.

16:04.467 --> 16:06.333
And then she's got
a little container
that looks like

16:06.367 --> 16:08.600
it probably had some
broken down marijuana in it.

16:08.633 --> 16:10.567
Plus, she's got
all these baggies here.

16:10.600 --> 16:13.633
-(radio chatter)
-So...

16:13.667 --> 16:17.733
uh, I'm gonna talk
to both of them and see
what they have to say.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.233
I found some marijuana
in the car.

16:23.267 --> 16:24.667
Is that yours?

16:24.700 --> 16:27.133
-I mean, if she gonna
go to the jail for it,
I'll take it.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.700
I don't know what the (bleep)
is in that car,

16:28.733 --> 16:30.333
but I don't wanna
see the girl go to jail, man.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.067
-So you don't-- you don't know
what's in there?

16:32.067 --> 16:34.233
-I don't know what's
in that car, but I don't
wanna-- I don't know

16:34.267 --> 16:36.433
what's in that--
She just picked me up, man.

16:36.467 --> 16:39.067
-Did you see any marijuana
or anything like that in the car
when you got in?

16:39.067 --> 16:41.733
-I smoke marijuana all the time,
but I ain't seen no marijuana.

16:41.767 --> 16:43.233
-But you didn't see
any in the car?

16:43.267 --> 16:45.467
-So you didn't know
there was any in there?

16:45.500 --> 16:47.733
All right.
-I'm just keepin' it
honest with you.

16:47.767 --> 16:50.267
-No, and I appreciate that
a hundred percent, all right?

16:50.300 --> 16:52.667
Just hang tight for me,
and I'll let you know
what's goin' on, all right?

16:52.700 --> 16:54.400
-You got it.
What's your name again?
-Officer Carter.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.200
-Thank you, Officer.
-No problem, hang tight.

16:59.067 --> 17:00.233
All right, here's the deal.

17:00.267 --> 17:01.900
You're gonna go to jail
tonight, all right?

17:01.933 --> 17:04.333
For the possession
of the-- the marijuana,

17:04.367 --> 17:05.433
the possession of the scale

17:05.467 --> 17:08.367
that has the marijuana on it,
all right?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.633
He's sayin' that he would
take it for you,

17:10.667 --> 17:13.800
but he didn't know
that it was in the car.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.400
So it's-- it's not on him.

17:15.433 --> 17:18.600
And he said he was gonna
take the charges, but
what happened?

17:18.633 --> 17:21.367
-If he doesn't know
it's in the car, I'm not gonna
take him to jail for it.

17:21.400 --> 17:24.500
It's your car.
All of your possessions
are in the car, so,

17:24.533 --> 17:26.600
at this point you're gonna
go to jail.

17:26.633 --> 17:28.167
It's a misdemeanor charge.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.700
But, be aware, I know
what you're doin' out here.

17:30.733 --> 17:33.733
I know that you don't just have
all kinds of baggies,
and a scale,

17:33.767 --> 17:36.200
and that amount
of marijuana for personal use.

17:36.233 --> 17:39.100
-There's bags in the car?
-Yes. Come on, now.

17:39.133 --> 17:40.433
-I don't know
what's in the car.

17:40.467 --> 17:41.867
I don't know
what's in the car.
It's not my car,

17:41.900 --> 17:43.833
I've already said
that it's not my car.

17:43.867 --> 17:46.633
And there was somebody
obviously riding with me,

17:46.667 --> 17:48.967
but I'm not saying
that anything is his, either,

17:49.067 --> 17:51.300
so, just-- Can I just make sure
that I have my wallet with me?

17:51.333 --> 17:54.100
-I'll make sure that you have
all your stuff, all right?
-So I can bond out of jail--

17:54.133 --> 17:58.467
-I'll make sure that you have
all your stuff, your wallet,
your-- your, um...

17:58.500 --> 18:00.067
your phone
and everything like that,
all right?

18:00.100 --> 18:02.600
-So he's not even
going to jail, either, so...

18:02.633 --> 18:04.400
-No.
Unfortunately, you're gonna
take the ride tonight,

18:04.433 --> 18:07.633
all right?
-So can you tell him to keep
his phone on for me, please?

18:07.667 --> 18:09.900
-Yeah. Of course.
-Whatever, so I can talk to him?

18:09.933 --> 18:11.800
-All right?
Hang tight, okay?

18:13.900 --> 18:16.100
-I'd go to jail for that girl
right now, man.

18:16.133 --> 18:17.767
-She knows that.
I told her that already.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.267
-I'd go to jail for that girl
right now.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.233
And it's not because I'm in love
with her, but because I don't

18:21.267 --> 18:23.700
wanna see her
go to (bleep) jail.

18:23.733 --> 18:26.667
-All right, man.
She wants to talk to you,
so let-- let's go over there

18:26.700 --> 18:28.333
and talk to her real quick.

18:28.367 --> 18:29.833
-You don't wanna
tell the people that's mine?

18:29.867 --> 18:32.667
-Why would I snitch on you?
(laughs)

18:32.700 --> 18:35.967
Why would I snitch?
Wait, wait, wait-- I'm still
gonna go to--

18:36.067 --> 18:37.967
-This is the craziest thing
I've ever seen in my life, girl.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.267
-What do you mean?
-For us to be right here,
at this particular time,

18:40.300 --> 18:42.100
not that you did anything...
-We can't both go to jail.

18:42.133 --> 18:43.133
-I know, Illie,
I know, Illie.

18:43.167 --> 18:44.767
-If I say any--
I'm just sayin'.

18:44.800 --> 18:48.067
So what I-- I'm supposed
to say it's-- Oh, boy.

18:48.100 --> 18:50.067
-It's your situation, Illie,
that's all I'm sayin'.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.833
-No, it's not.

18:51.867 --> 18:55.967
Listen, don't worry about it.
It's okay. I do this.
I told you that.

18:56.067 --> 18:57.433
-No, you don't, Illie.

18:57.467 --> 18:59.833
-I've been goin'
to jail-- years!

18:59.867 --> 19:02.067
I'm tryin' to get it right,
but it-- you know,
it takes time.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.833
I'm gonna stop talking
because this is not the place.

19:04.867 --> 19:07.200
-All right, unfortunately,
you're gonna get the ride
tonight, all right?

19:07.233 --> 19:08.533
He's gonna get his stuff
outta there.

19:08.567 --> 19:10.700
I'll make sure that you get
the number so that you have

19:10.733 --> 19:11.867
a number to call though,
all right?

19:11.900 --> 19:13.333
-Yes.
-Hang tight.

19:13.367 --> 19:15.700
-And I'm not comin' back
to the park after hours.
-All right.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.933
-What all did you find
in the car again?

19:18.967 --> 19:20.367
If you don't mind tellin' me
one more time?

19:20.400 --> 19:22.767
-All right, yeah.
We found some-- some weed--
You can go.

19:22.800 --> 19:26.600
We found some weed,
13 grams about.
Um, we found--

19:26.633 --> 19:29.733
-Didn't Morgan & Morgan
just pass a law?
(laughs)

19:29.767 --> 19:32.333
-Unfortunately not.
-If you find weed,
that's like a misdemeanor?

19:32.367 --> 19:35.467
Where's my wallet?
Oh, right here.
-Um, we found a scale...

19:35.500 --> 19:37.200
-This is all I need, y'all.
-All right, you're good.

19:37.233 --> 19:41.267
We found a scale
and we found, uh, some bags
and stuff like that, so...

19:41.300 --> 19:42.900
All right?

19:42.933 --> 19:46.300
-All this over--
Get back to Daddy Dee's.
I'm gonna have a long walk.

19:46.333 --> 19:48.400
-Have a good night, sir,
all right?
-Y'all, too.

19:49.433 --> 19:51.567
-132 and Bush,
I've got him at gunpoint.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.533
-Dispatcher:
Okay, gunpoint, 132 and Bush.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.700
Cover is code three.

19:54.733 --> 19:57.700
-(overlapping
police radio chatter)

20:04.367 --> 20:06.333
-Dispatcher:
Okay, we'll still send
a code three.

20:06.367 --> 20:08.633
-(theme music playing)
