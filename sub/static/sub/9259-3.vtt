01:15.630 --> 01:18.190
[Groans]
My legs ain't movin, man.

BettyJohnson's boy.

01:48.529 --> 01:50.622
Drive-by in the hood.
That's original.

01:50.731 --> 01:53.256
Well, you know,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

01:53.367 --> 01:55.267
The victims are all
decked out Spookstreet.

01:55.369 --> 01:57.269
Driver was gone.
Must have fled.

01:57.371 --> 01:59.601
We found a halfkey of
tar heroin hidden in the backseat.

01:59.707 --> 02:02.369
- [Man Shouting]
- What's with him?

02:02.476 --> 02:05.138
- Just babbling.
Paramedics say he's not gonna make it.
- Witnesses?

02:05.246 --> 02:08.044
Oh, yeah.
They're just falling all over themselves.

02:08.149 --> 02:10.674
See no evil, hear no evil.

02:13.688 --> 02:15.656
[Rock]

02:25.766 --> 02:30.703
- So?
- What are you hearing in
Juvie about Antwon Mitchell?

02:30.805 --> 02:32.705
Besides, uh,
building parks...

02:32.807 --> 02:35.776
and holdin' freedom rallies,
he's movin' tar heroin on the street.

02:38.779 --> 02:41.077
Shane's been cozying up
to the guy lately.

02:43.350 --> 02:46.046
- / think he might be in business with him.
- He's not my problem-

02:46.153 --> 02:50.419
We all have a stake in making sure that
Shane stays out of I.A.D.'s headlights.

02:50.524 --> 02:54.119
He gets in over his head, gets pinched,
we're his best chance of gettin'a deal.

02:54.228 --> 02:56.526
No. Shane wouldn't.

02:56.630 --> 03:00.794
He was ready to go to jail for Mara
when she almost killed Tavon.

03:00.901 --> 03:03.267
He's a father now.

03:03.370 --> 03:05.270
You'd be surprised what you'd do
for your kids.

03:05.372 --> 03:07.237
[Curtis]
/t never goddamn ends.

03:07.341 --> 03:09.901

We need to get back close to him.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.478
Make sure if there's a problem
we can fix it before it's too late.

03:12.580 --> 03:15.708
- I haven't talked to him since the shit went down.
- I'll deal with him one-on-one.

03:15.816 --> 03:17.943
Look, I spoke to your C.O.

03:18.052 --> 03:21.021
I want you to ride with
Danny and Julien tomorrow.

03:21.122 --> 03:24.023
They've been assigned to
tap into the One-niners.

03:24.125 --> 03:28.221
If anyone's running their mouth about Shane,
I want to hear about it before anybody else.

03:29.463 --> 03:31.590
[Chattering]

03:31.699 --> 03:33.758

- [Man] Morning.

03:53.554 --> 03:55.522
Um...

03:55.623 --> 03:58.251
I think I've had a chance to meet
and speak with all of you...

03:58.359 --> 04:01.260
but this is my first
opportunity as your captain.

04:01.362 --> 04:04.331
[Applause]

04:06.433 --> 04:09.664
/n the, uh- Excuse me.
[Clears Throat]

04:11.639 --> 04:16.440
In the two-plus years
since this, uh, substation's inception...

04:16.543 --> 04:20.105
the Farmington District has had
its share of successes and failures.

04:20.214 --> 04:22.876
The difficulties
are well-known.

04:22.983 --> 04:28.888
Unfortunately, the successes are mostly
known only in this house.

04:28.989 --> 04:33.187
/ see a lot of wonderful people
determined to make a difference.

04:33.294 --> 04:35.592
I wouldn't have taken
this job if I didn't.

04:37.898 --> 04:40.093
[Clears Throat]

04:43.037 --> 04:47.770
Actually, uh, I'm better one-on-one
than, uh, in front of a big crowd.

04:47.875 --> 04:49.843
[Horn Honks]

04:49.944 --> 04:52.378
They say you should imagine
your audience naked...

04:52.479 --> 04:55.039
but, uh, with this crowd
I wouldn't suggest it.

04:55.149 --> 04:57.174
[All Laughing]

04:57.284 --> 04:59.445
- [Woman] Good one.
- Look.

05:00.921 --> 05:02.855
I know what
it's like out there.

05:02.957 --> 05:04.857
I worked this neighborhood.

05:04.959 --> 05:07.951
You put your life
on the line every day.

05:08.062 --> 05:11.862
The people that you protect don't
thank you enough for that.

05:11.966 --> 05:13.957
So let me thank you
for them.

05:14.068 --> 05:16.502
The problems here
aren't about personnel.

05:16.604 --> 05:19.937
They're about policy,
and that is what /'m here to change.

05:20.040 --> 05:21.940
- [Applause]
- We-

05:23.077 --> 05:26.240
We police a largely
minority district.

05:26.347 --> 05:29.976
They're universally poor.
Most of them don't speak the language.

05:30.084 --> 05:32.644
They look one direction,
see financial skyscrapers.

05:32.753 --> 05:36.245
They look in the other direction,
they see the Hollywood sign.

05:36.357 --> 05:38.951
In between is
the L.A. they know.

05:39.059 --> 05:42.722
Gangs, drugs, fear.

05:42.830 --> 05:44.821
We're not miracle workers.

05:44.932 --> 05:47.833
We don't have any hidden
tricks up our sleeves.

05:47.935 --> 05:51.371
We can't make fathers
want to stay in their kids' lives.

05:51.472 --> 05:54.635
We can't, uh, solve poverty.

05:54.742 --> 05:59.475
We can't take the addiction
out of heroin or cocaine.

05:59.580 --> 06:03.243
Our job is to distinguish between
the criminals and the citizens.

06:03.350 --> 06:08.253
/t's been too hard for the good people
and too easy for the assholes.

06:08.355 --> 06:10.880
And we are gonna change that.
We are gonna turn that around.

06:10.991 --> 06:13.516
- Yes.
- Last night- Last night...

06:13.627 --> 06:16.960
three members of the Spookstreet Souljahs
were killed in a drive-by.

06:17.064 --> 06:21.728
Three hours later, they struck back at
their rival gang, the Farmington One-niners.

06:21.835 --> 06:26.033
Two more dead.
Five hours, five lives gone.

06:27.508 --> 06:30.602
Uh, Steve. You're lead on the case.
What do we know?

06:30.711 --> 06:34.772
Well, not much. We're currently looking for
the owner of the car, but he's AWOL.

06:34.882 --> 06:38.340
- Witnesses?
- [Billings] None that are cooperating.

06:41.889 --> 06:43.982
Starting today...

06:44.091 --> 06:48.528
all drug- and gang-related homicides
will go through Vic Mackey.

06:48.629 --> 06:51.689
/'ve posted a list of
10 detectives and 20 unis...

06:51.799 --> 06:53.733
who will work
directly under Vic.

06:53.834 --> 06:57.270
He'll be leading a task force
designed to learn everything we can...

06:57.371 --> 07:00.534
about the roughly 50 gangs
who operate on our turf.

07:00.641 --> 07:03.610
Their membership,
their businesses, chains of command.

07:03.711 --> 07:07.613
Federal asset forfeiture laws
will now be enforced in Farmington.

07:07.715 --> 07:12.618
A drug dealer uses a car to distribute drugs,
we're gonna seize that vehicle.

07:12.720 --> 07:16.178
A gang sells crack out of their back room,
we're gonna take that home.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.815
Stereo equipment,
plasma TV's.

07:18.926 --> 07:23.727
Everything bought with drug money,
we're gonna take those assets, auction them off.

07:23.831 --> 07:28.859
The D.A.'s office will get a third
to help finance further prosecutions.

07:28.969 --> 07:31.631
A third will be funneled back
into the community...

07:31.739 --> 07:36.233
for better social services, for safe playgrounds,
for after-school programs.

07:36.343 --> 07:40.712
We want these people to know that we are about
more than just throwing their men intojail.

07:40.814 --> 07:43.806
The rest of the proceeds
are gonna be used to help you.

07:43.917 --> 07:48.149
Now, besides the, uh, grand reopening
of the men's room-

07:48.255 --> 07:50.917
[Laughter, Applause]

07:52.226 --> 07:54.353
uh, /'m gonna hire more cops.

07:54.461 --> 07:59.160
/'m gonna authorize overtime when one of you
tells me that you need it to close a case.

07:59.266 --> 08:02.167
I'm gonna purchase equipment
that actually works.

08:03.837 --> 08:04.872
[Woman]
/t's about time.

08:04.872 --> 08:06.339
[Woman]
/t's about time.

08:06.440 --> 08:08.806
I'm going to encourage
informants to come forward...

08:08.909 --> 08:12.106
by giving them a cut
of assets we seize.

08:12.212 --> 08:15.010
Citizens whose fear and silence
the gangs depend on...

08:15.115 --> 08:17.811
we are gonna make them
a better deal than the bangers.

08:17.918 --> 08:21.945
/t'll sting at first. People
usually don't like change.

08:22.056 --> 08:25.719
And I still wouldn't expect
any thank-yous...

08:25.826 --> 08:28.795
but we will
make things better.

08:28.896 --> 08:30.955
There's been
another retaliation.

08:31.065 --> 08:34.057
There's one dead and two critical
on Alvarado.

08:37.071 --> 08:38.971
The job is impossible.

08:39.073 --> 08:41.234
I can't do it without you.

08:41.341 --> 08:43.332
- So let's get started.
- [Applause]

08:43.443 --> 08:46.379

/ didn't think you could top
fixing the men's john...

09:04.865 --> 09:07.060
but I gotta give
that speech four flushes.

09:07.167 --> 09:09.067
Don't be too impressed.

09:09.169 --> 09:11.137
I still haven't gotten
my voice mail to work.

09:11.238 --> 09:13.706
A gang war's the last thing
/ need right now.

09:13.807 --> 09:15.798
/'ll serve
all open warrants.

09:15.909 --> 09:18.400
I'll double up patrols in Spookstreet
and One-niner territory...

09:18.512 --> 09:21.345
get as many of these guys off
the street as possible.

09:21.448 --> 09:24.315
What's the average life cycle
of days of rage in the Farm?

09:24.418 --> 09:27.080
/'ve seen them as short as a week,
as long as a year.

09:27.187 --> 09:31.089
Look. Dealing with these
gang beefs can take time.

09:31.191 --> 09:33.591
- They're complicated.
- They're a bunch of kids shooting at each other.

09:33.694 --> 09:36.185
Stop it, so we can move forward.

09:38.031 --> 09:40.056
I don't know.
What do you think?

09:40.167 --> 09:42.897
Sherman's march
through the hood.

09:43.003 --> 09:46.769
Sounds like one step forward,
two steps back.

09:46.874 --> 09:51.743
Aceveda's old office is now our command post,
courtesy of our new captain.

09:51.845 --> 09:55.576
Uh, these all outline
all known gang turf in Farmington.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.412
Each of you has been assigned
a territory to map.

If you see a shithead, engage him.

10:05.359 --> 10:07.259
Take his picture.
Document his ink.

Get his name, street tag.

is Farmington One-niner territory.

10:14.201 --> 10:17.170
[Mackey] Now it's your piece of paradise.
Spookstreet and One-niners are warring.

10:17.271 --> 10:20.069
/ want you to get in their face,
find out what they're fighting about.

10:20.174 --> 10:23.302
Lem's gonna ride with you two today,

10:23.410 --> 10:26.277
- Thought you were working Juvie.
- Well, half the Niners are under 17...

10:26.380 --> 10:29.247
and I mixed it up with the other
half on the Strike Team.

10:29.349 --> 10:33.080
We're especially interested in an O.G.
named Antwon Mitchell.

10:33.187 --> 10:34.814
Seems like
he's back in action.

10:34.922 --> 10:36.822

Owner of the shot-up Escalade's rap sheet.

10:46.500 --> 10:48.730
We got unis posted at his
apartment and known hangouts.

10:48.835 --> 10:52.168
All right. Put patrols on
his girlfriend's house. Mother's too.

10:52.272 --> 10:55.935
Trouble hits, these assholes always run
one of two ways:

10:56.043 --> 10:58.773
the pussy they're getting into
or the pussy they came out of.

10:58.879 --> 11:00.813
Find Stank.
He runs the One-niners.

Tough getting up in the morning
without a prison guard banging on your cell door?

11:13.360 --> 11:16.454
- Rough night.
- [Mackey] Too busy running a gang war, Antwon?

11:16.563 --> 11:18.497
Too busy trying to find out
what started it.

11:18.599 --> 11:20.931
Shootings scare away
customers, huh?

11:21.034 --> 11:24.435

- Somebody's gotta keep the peace.

gonna keep that peace.

they're warring about, man.

11:33.981 --> 11:37.075

stop it, but I don't.

23:51.684 --> 23:55.245
- / don't do porn. / was dancin
- Tomato, "tom-ah-to."

23:55.355 --> 23:57.323
- Thanks for your help.
- Yeah.

23:58.925 --> 24:00.984
Just like old times, brother.

24:01.094 --> 24:05.224
Yeah. Well, uh,
see you around.

24:08.801 --> 24:11.326
[Monica]
Who gave you your black eye?

24:11.437 --> 24:13.337
I ain't no snitch.

24:13.439 --> 24:15.339
He'll kill me.

24:15.441 --> 24:17.500
You have a newborn, right?

24:17.610 --> 24:21.478
- Ten months.
- You violated your parole.

24:21.581 --> 24:25.483
You do another bid in Chowchilla,
Child Services is gonna take that baby away.

24:25.585 --> 24:27.485
I don't want that.

24:27.587 --> 24:32.286
- I didn't violate nothing.
- It's called consorting with a known felon.

24:32.392 --> 24:34.792
- Peter hit me.
- Who's Peter?

24:34.894 --> 24:37.260
Puppethead.
My baby daddy.

24:37.363 --> 24:39.263
He saw the video.
He gotjealous.

24:39.365 --> 24:41.663
Just 'cause I suck his dick
don't make him my man.

24:41.768 --> 24:43.668
Puppethead's a One-niner?

24:43.770 --> 24:46.136
This war- it's about you?

24:46.239 --> 24:48.605
I guess I'm the bomb, huh?

24:51.611 --> 24:53.806
We're investigating
a convenience store robbery.

24:53.913 --> 24:55.813
I don't do those anymore.

24:55.915 --> 25:00.249
Well, forgive me if I'm skeptical, Kyle,
but, uh, we've got your prints on file.

25:00.353 --> 25:03.322
- We're running them against the coffee cup.
- Coffee cup?

25:03.423 --> 25:06.984
Yeah. Uh, guy threw coffee in the clerk's face
while he was making change...

25:07.093 --> 25:08.560
cleaned out the register.

25:08.661 --> 25:11.255
[Chuckles]
I always used a knife.

25:11.364 --> 25:13.594
- Can I get a moment with you, please?
- Sure.

25:17.937 --> 25:22.704
I by no means meant to offend you,
your ethnic background or your religion in any way.

25:22.809 --> 25:24.709
l- I apologize profusely.

25:24.811 --> 25:27.974
His comments were not reflective
of this department whatsoever.

25:28.081 --> 25:30.049
[Farsi]

25:35.755 --> 25:39.156
[Farsi]

25:39.258 --> 25:41.488
- He asks if you caught the guy yet.
- Not yet.

25:41.594 --> 25:44.028
But I assure you. I won't
let him rest till he does.

25:44.130 --> 25:47.065
/f you ever have a problem
in the future, call me directly.

25:47.166 --> 25:49.134
Thank you.
[Farsi]

25:52.505 --> 25:55.133
Borderline racism aside,
I don't have time for this nonsense.

25:55.241 --> 25:57.607
I'm sorry.
I was distracted.

25:57.710 --> 26:00.270
It's- It's not easy being
cut out of all the action here.

26:00.379 --> 26:03.371
It's my first day.
I'm already tired of hearing it.

26:13.326 --> 26:15.920
Puppethead'll be on edge,
worried about Spookstreet retaliation.

26:16.028 --> 26:17.928
- So be careful.
- Got it.

26:22.735 --> 26:24.600
- [Whistling]
- [Ronnie] Spotters.

26:24.704 --> 26:26.672
He's running.
Let's go!

26:40.853 --> 26:43.083
You want to go over?
Go over.

26:43.189 --> 26:45.623
- [Shouts, Groans]
- [Dog Barking]

26:45.725 --> 26:50.162
Puppethead started this war because he didn't
like Choppa inside his woman's cooch.

26:50.263 --> 26:52.561
[Puppethead]
Spookstreet tried to take me out.

26:52.665 --> 26:55.065
Oh, yeah? Where'd they
take shots at you?

26:55.168 --> 26:57.728
I'll send unis over there
to look for bullet holes.

26:57.837 --> 27:00.271
- / saw the video, bitch.
- [Mackey] / know you started-

27:00.373 --> 27:04.275
[Monica]
/s that the guy who shot up your car?

27:04.377 --> 27:07.312
Do you even worry about yourself?
About being killed?

27:07.413 --> 27:09.472
When it's time, it's time.

27:09.582 --> 27:12.847
Well, that's a way
of looking at it.

27:12.952 --> 27:16.353
I got a witness who saw you take the shots.
Help yourself out and cooperate.

27:16.455 --> 27:20.152
Got a witness, huh?
Let me hear what he got to spit.

27:30.736 --> 27:33.466
[Sighs]
What other leverage do we have?

27:33.573 --> 27:36.167
[Mackey]
/ had Ronnie look into Choppa's finances.

27:36.275 --> 27:38.675
He rents an apartment
on Baxter.

27:38.778 --> 27:40.837
But he also owns a house.

27:45.284 --> 27:47.582
- How'd he pay for it?
- Cash down payment.

27:47.687 --> 27:50.918
- Makes the mortgages with money orders.
- Drug money.

27:51.023 --> 27:54.083
- Who lives there?
- His mom and her two other kids.

27:54.193 --> 27:57.253
We don't have
anything else.

27:57.363 --> 27:59.354
His mother know how
he paid for the house?

27:59.465 --> 28:01.365
She knows he's never
held down a job.

28:01.500 --> 28:06.961
Can we make a solid connection between
the house payments and drug money?

28:07.073 --> 28:09.303
You gonna tell Choppa
we're taking his mom's house?

28:09.408 --> 28:11.308
He's tough.
He could call our bluff.

28:11.410 --> 28:13.378
What if it isn't a bluff?

28:15.014 --> 28:18.916
He doesn't I.D. the shooters,
help us stop this, we take the house.

28:19.018 --> 28:20.918
I love it.

28:21.020 --> 28:23.045
How old are the kids?

28:23.155 --> 28:25.214
Young.

28:28.728 --> 28:30.923
Could be a huge
P.R. nightmare.

28:31.030 --> 28:33.521
Tossing two kids out onto
the street is not exactly...

28:33.633 --> 28:36.193
the cleanest example
ofhow / want this to work.

28:36.302 --> 28:38.361
Taking the house is
the only leverage we have.

28:38.471 --> 28:42.134
This policy got a shitload of resistance
when / pitched it to Pol Com.

28:42.241 --> 28:45.210
Chief bit because
nothing else has worked.

28:45.311 --> 28:48.337
The last thing / want is to
give the naysayers any ammo...

28:48.447 --> 28:51.644
to shut this down before
it gets a chance to take off.

28:56.389 --> 28:58.949
[Mackey]
Rise and shine.

28:59.058 --> 29:01.549
- Still playin', huh?
- Who shot at you?

29:01.661 --> 29:03.526
- Last time /'m asking.
- Good.

29:03.629 --> 29:07.087
- 'Cause I'm sick of you barking.
- Okay. Take the house.

29:07.199 --> 29:09.099
- With pleasure.
- What house?

29:09.201 --> 29:12.227
The one you bought
your mother by dealing dope.

29:12.338 --> 29:14.238
Yeah, right.
You can't take shit.

29:14.340 --> 29:16.831
Come with me.
/'ll show you.

29:16.942 --> 29:18.910
[Chattering]

29:26.686 --> 29:29.280
Do you know what
federal asset forfeiture laws are, Choppa?

29:29.388 --> 29:31.185
Skipped that course
at Harvard, huh?

29:31.290 --> 29:33.952
It means any property
bought with drug money...

29:34.060 --> 29:36.790
or used to facilitate
the drug trade can be seized.

29:36.896 --> 29:40.263
- I ain't falling for no bullshit.
- [Mackey] No bullshit.

29:40.366 --> 29:44.268
Unless you prove you bought the house
legitimately, it's ours to put up for auction.

29:44.370 --> 29:47.464
[Monica] We're not required to provide you
a defense either. Wanna fight this?

29:47.573 --> 29:49.905
You gotta hire a lawyer
on your own dime.

29:50.009 --> 29:53.137
Quit clowning.
This is America.

30:01.020 --> 30:03.488
Turns out a One-niner named Puppethead
started this war.

30:03.589 --> 30:06.717
Yeah. His shorty had a thing
for a Souljah's pogo stick.

30:06.826 --> 30:09.886
- That right?
- Yeah. This is all about a jealous boyfriend.

30:09.995 --> 30:12.623
I see my tax dollars
are being well spent.

30:12.732 --> 30:15.496
- What do you want from me?
- I got the guy who started this.

30:15.601 --> 30:18.729
I need you to keep these assholes on the street
from shooting at each other...

30:18.838 --> 30:21.500
long enough for me to show the neighborhood
that things are changing...

30:21.607 --> 30:23.939
that we got things
under control.

30:24.043 --> 30:26.603
- What makes you think they'll listen to me?
- [Chuckles]

30:26.712 --> 30:30.910
/'ve seen you work a room. Even convinced
a few people you're on the straight and narrow.

30:31.016 --> 30:34.611
Feel free to confess
that you're just a piece-of-shit gangster.

30:34.720 --> 30:37.314
Thanks for the help.

30:41.794 --> 30:43.694
- Detective Wyms.
- [Man] Yeah. Thanks for comin

30:43.796 --> 30:45.957
- [Dutch] What happened?
- Guy bought a cup of coffee.

30:46.065 --> 30:48.363
I opened the register to give him change,
he splashed me.

30:48.467 --> 30:50.526
Grabbed my cash and ran.
I'm lucky the coffee wasn't hot.

30:50.636 --> 30:53.298
- Your surveillance camera working?
- Got him on my cell phone.

30:53.406 --> 30:55.374
- [Beeps]
- Didn't you talk to that guy today?

30:55.474 --> 30:59.171
Yeah. He had
a rock solid alibi.

30:59.278 --> 31:02.679
Aw, man. Aw, man.

31:02.782 --> 31:04.750
- This is entrapment.
- [Claudette] How do you figure?

31:04.850 --> 31:08.081
I'm a thief. He's telling me about asking
for change and then throwing coffee.

31:08.187 --> 31:10.485
It's like giving a junkie
a syringe.

31:10.589 --> 31:13.524
I was done robbing until
he put it back in my head.

31:15.995 --> 31:18.156
That's our guy?

31:18.264 --> 31:23.998
Uh, actually, we inadvertently slipped
a few details to one of our other suspects.

31:24.103 --> 31:26.264
Kind of created a copycat.
But we got him.

31:26.372 --> 31:28.704
Still working on
the original guy.

31:32.445 --> 31:35.744
Way to go. You get assigned a simple
robbery, cause a crime wave.

31:35.848 --> 31:39.079
Remind me never to
put you guys on a murder case.

31:42.855 --> 31:44.755
Hope you're happy.

31:44.857 --> 31:47.348
Keys. Thanks.

31:47.493 --> 31:52.157
Hey. Called your dentist.
Paid for your choppers with cash.

31:52.264 --> 31:55.859
- Tooth fairy wants 'em back.
- Man, I ain't giving you my fronts.

31:55.968 --> 31:59.699
Either you take them out yourself,
or I get a pair of pliers.

32:03.609 --> 32:06.009
Thanks, honey.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.113
Vic.

32:09.215 --> 32:11.115
What's up?

32:11.217 --> 32:14.243
One thing we know about Antwon is
he don't like to strap his shit up.

32:14.353 --> 32:17.789
- What'd you hear?
- Guy's fathered a dozen children
from six different mothers.

32:17.890 --> 32:21.291
Even knocked up a couple from behind bars
by sneaking his sperm out.

32:21.393 --> 32:26.524
Oh, shit. You hit up that many women,
you're bound to leave some serious scorn behind.

32:26.632 --> 32:29.897
All right. Let's find out their names.
Anything about Shane?

32:30.002 --> 32:32.402
- No. Not a word.
- All right. Keep listening.

32:32.505 --> 32:35.838
Aloicious? Aloicious,
what've you got us into?

32:35.941 --> 32:38.136
[Choppa] /t's okay, Mama.
They'rejust trying to scare me.

32:38.244 --> 32:39.541
It ain't gonna work though.

32:39.645 --> 32:41.636
/t's workin'on me.

32:41.747 --> 32:44.147
/t's workin'on me, Aloicious.
Are you crazy?

32:44.250 --> 32:46.275
- [Mackey] Can / help you?
- Let go of me.

32:46.385 --> 32:49.149
- Calm down.
- Don't tell me to calm down. Who's in charge?

32:49.255 --> 32:51.849
- Who's putting my babies on the street?
- /'m Captain Rawling.

32:51.957 --> 32:54.858
You did this?
You're taking my house?

32:54.960 --> 32:56.860
/'ve reserved shelter space
for the three of you.

32:56.962 --> 32:59.590
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a shelter space?

32:59.698 --> 33:03.190
The Department of Social and Human Services
can help you find permanent residence.

33:03.302 --> 33:06.169
You wanna help?
You give me my home back.

33:06.272 --> 33:10.402
- / can't do that.
- You got no right throwing
children out of their beds.

33:10.509 --> 33:13.069
All your son has to do is cooperate
with our investigation.

33:13.178 --> 33:15.738
He does that,
he will help us save a lot oflives.

33:15.848 --> 33:18.578
My boy got shot at.
He's innocent.

33:18.684 --> 33:21.118
Your boy bought your home
using drug money.

33:21.220 --> 33:24.815
You knew where that money came from,
and you chose to look the other way.

33:24.924 --> 33:27.256
You don't know what
it's like living here.

33:27.359 --> 33:30.624
You think I can just pick and choose
how to go about surviving?

33:31.764 --> 33:34.130
You don't have children,
do you?

33:35.167 --> 33:37.067
[Shouts]
Do you?

33:37.169 --> 33:40.036
'Cause if you did,
you couldn't do this.

33:40.139 --> 33:43.631
- No mother could do this.
- Six children are dead.

33:43.742 --> 33:46.540
- How do you think those mothers-
- You don't have kids of your own...

33:46.645 --> 33:49.341
so you're throwing
mine out.

33:49.448 --> 33:53.111
Just be glad that all you lost today
was your home and not your son.

33:53.218 --> 33:55.118
Shut up!

33:55.220 --> 33:57.188
You just shut up!

34:00.326 --> 34:02.294
[Door Opens]

34:06.899 --> 34:08.867
These are recruiters.

34:08.967 --> 34:10.902
Newbies just got
their stripes.

34:11.003 --> 34:13.437
They find the next generation
to bring in.

34:13.539 --> 34:17.839
What's up, Lil Bull? Hey, man. I got some people
here want to take your guys's picture.

34:17.943 --> 34:20.639
Gonna make you all famous.
All right? Go ahead, man.

34:20.746 --> 34:22.213
- Just say cheese.
- [Shutter Clicks]

34:22.313 --> 34:24.373
[Julien]
What's your name, son?

34:24.483 --> 34:26.246
Run, stupid. Run.

34:29.188 --> 34:33.090
Come here. When a police officer gives you
an instruction, you listen. Understand?

34:33.192 --> 34:36.184
- I don't want my picture taken.
- Then why are you hanging out with gangs?

34:36.295 --> 34:38.559
- Hey.
- What are you, my mama now?

34:38.664 --> 34:41.132
Go.

34:41.233 --> 34:43.599
[Mackey]
Look. This lawsuit's gonna bury us financially.

34:43.702 --> 34:45.601
But can you afford
not to sue?

34:45.704 --> 34:49.469
The money I'm asking you
to put up for medical tests is peanuts...

34:49.574 --> 34:53.670
compared to what two autistic kids
are gonna need over their lifetimes.

34:53.779 --> 34:56.270
I work at a hospital.
What if I pulled some strings...

34:56.382 --> 34:58.543
and found a way to get
the tests done there?

34:58.651 --> 35:01.279
Well, the doctors I use
are experts.

35:01.387 --> 35:03.821
They're expensive,
but their testimony carries weight.

35:03.922 --> 35:06.789
Well, her friend Gail's
the head of pediatrics.

35:06.925 --> 35:09.826
- That expert enough for ya?
- Talk to her.

35:09.928 --> 35:13.830
If she's willing to testify
and can provide the credentials I need...

35:13.932 --> 35:15.923
- / guess / can live with it.
- Good.

35:19.304 --> 35:21.431
Can I at least
eat dinner in peace?

35:25.678 --> 35:29.239
You know, this isn't about
right and wrong with you anymore.

35:29.348 --> 35:31.578
/t's about pride.

35:31.684 --> 35:35.051
Can't psychoanalyze killers anymore,
so you're giving me the once-over.

35:35.154 --> 35:39.147
Okay. Uh, maybe it's easier to shoot yourself
in the foot and be a martyr...

35:39.258 --> 35:41.351
than to be a captain
and make tough decisions.

35:41.460 --> 35:43.792
You can always get
another partner, Dutch.

35:45.164 --> 35:47.064
I don't want that.

35:47.166 --> 35:50.192
What do you expect me to do?

35:50.302 --> 35:53.396
Y-You're not
giving me any choice.

36:03.682 --> 36:05.650
[Knocks]

36:08.754 --> 36:10.722
Hello.

36:11.957 --> 36:13.948
I thought your shift
ended an hour ago.

36:14.059 --> 36:17.153
/'m just finishing up
some paperwork.

36:17.262 --> 36:20.288
Captain, / wanted to thank you
for including me in all this.

36:20.399 --> 36:22.367
It feels really good
to have a mission...

36:22.468 --> 36:24.231
not just out answering
drunk and disorderlies.

36:24.336 --> 36:26.361
Thank Vic.

36:26.472 --> 36:28.406
He recommended you.

36:40.853 --> 36:45.187
[Woman] There's no reliable evidence to prove
a causal link between thimerosal and autism.

36:45.290 --> 36:48.521
/ won't do the testing
because / won't be a party to this lawsuit.

36:48.627 --> 36:53.257
What about the 300% rise in cases
since they increased the vaccines for children?

36:53.365 --> 36:56.960
Could just mean we're getting better
at diagnosing autism.

36:57.069 --> 36:59.401
There aren't enough
case studies to prove anything.

36:59.505 --> 37:02.565
They're shooting our kids up
with mercury.

37:02.674 --> 37:05.609
You're saying that
it's a coincidence they're sick?

37:05.711 --> 37:07.611
What would you do, Gail?

37:07.713 --> 37:11.205
You love your children for who they are.
Just get out of the suit. Save your money.

37:11.316 --> 37:14.547
Why? 'Cause lawsuits like these
cost doctors like you a few bucks?

37:14.653 --> 37:16.553
- [Corrine] Vic.
- No.

37:16.655 --> 37:19.522
How many shots with thimerosal
have you prescribed to kids?

37:19.625 --> 37:21.718
Saying that they've been
poisoning our kids...

37:21.827 --> 37:24.261
is just like admitting
you've been doing it all along, right?

37:24.363 --> 37:26.263
/'ve devoted my life
to caring for children.

37:26.365 --> 37:29.163
And I'm a cop who
looks out for other cops.

37:29.268 --> 37:32.999
Don't you tell me that doctors
don't look out for other doctors.

37:33.105 --> 37:37.064
You know, helping 'em out, making sure
that they hide the truth from people like us.

37:37.176 --> 37:42.113
The only difference is what / do doesn't
screw kids up for the rest of their lives.

37:44.950 --> 37:47.350
Corrine, please.
Just talk to him.

37:47.452 --> 37:50.546
If you don't want to help us,
we're gonna find someone else who will.

37:50.656 --> 37:52.851
/t's not like that.

37:52.958 --> 37:55.859
This isn't who my children
were supposed to be.

37:55.961 --> 37:59.124
It cost me my marriage,
their future.

37:59.231 --> 38:01.199
And you're wrong.

38:07.272 --> 38:09.103
[Dog Barks /n Distance]

38:10.976 --> 38:13.206
My mom's at work.

38:13.312 --> 38:15.644
I came to ask you
what to do with this.

38:17.850 --> 38:21.217
These pictures, they go up
on a wall in our station house.

38:21.320 --> 38:24.448
Once they're up, they only come down
for one of two reasons:

38:24.556 --> 38:27.787
either you die
or you go tojail.

38:27.893 --> 38:31.329
Do I need to put this up, or will you consider
making some other choices?

38:31.430 --> 38:35.491
- Like what?
- / grew up around here.
There are other ways to go.

38:35.601 --> 38:37.626
Church. Sports.

38:37.736 --> 38:39.829
Nah. I ain't into that stuff.

38:39.938 --> 38:43.237
- What about the Explorer's Program?
- What's that?

38:43.342 --> 38:46.402
We take young men like you.
We teach 'em about law enforcement.

38:46.511 --> 38:48.411
Why do I want to be like you?

38:48.513 --> 38:50.811
Look. When we took
your picture, you ran.

38:50.916 --> 38:54.374
That means you're scared.
You're scared because you know it's wrong.

38:54.486 --> 38:56.477
You need to chill, Oprah.

38:56.588 --> 38:58.988
I ain't never gonna be
no sellout cop.

38:59.091 --> 39:02.219
/ just needed to know
what to do with this picture.

39:05.297 --> 39:07.197
Now I know.

39:11.503 --> 39:15.064
- Hey. Not too bad for day one, huh?
- We're gonna need a bigger room.

39:15.173 --> 39:18.574
I just got off the phone with Central.
Puppethead was bailed out last night.

39:18.677 --> 39:21.510
- He had a quarter of a million dollar bail.
- Antwon Mitchell...

39:21.613 --> 39:24.776
put up 25 grand
cash bond.

39:24.883 --> 39:27.784
- Goddamn.
- Guess you're thinking what I'm thinking.

39:27.886 --> 39:30.548
- Puppethead isn't long for this world.
- Or might be gone already.

39:50.075 --> 39:52.043
[Mackey]
Hey.

39:55.314 --> 39:57.282
- Where's Puppethead?
- People saying he's dead.

39:57.382 --> 39:59.646
- [Ronnie] Clear.
- Who's saying that?

39:59.751 --> 40:02.879
Antwon gave him up to Spookstreet,
so they'd end this war.

40:02.988 --> 40:05.650
I heard they whipped him,
chained him to a back of a car...

40:05.757 --> 40:08.123
and dragged him till
his skin peeled off.

40:08.226 --> 40:10.126
Nothing like that's
been reported.

40:10.228 --> 40:12.287
Well, that's what
they're sayin'.

40:12.397 --> 40:15.059
[Monica]
Antwon got a set to give up one of their own.

40:15.167 --> 40:17.567
- Do you believe that?
- Well...

40:19.171 --> 40:21.935
- we won't know for sure unless a body shows up.
- It'll show.

40:22.040 --> 40:25.339
- He'll want his bail money back.
- Yeah.

40:25.444 --> 40:29.210
ChenilleJenkins never went
to the shelter with her kids.

40:29.314 --> 40:32.875
Taking the house didn't
get Choppa to cooperate.

40:32.985 --> 40:35.647
The war's over.
Why does it feel like we lost?

40:35.754 --> 40:37.722
Well, we did.

40:37.823 --> 40:40.849
Antwon's showed the street
that he's got more juice than we do.

40:43.729 --> 40:46.960
Look. We got our shooters.
We made the peace.

40:47.065 --> 40:50.000
Nothing says you can't give that house
back to Chenille and her two kids.

40:55.574 --> 40:57.303
[Knocks]

40:57.409 --> 41:01.038
- [Baby Coos]
- Surprise.

41:02.481 --> 41:04.449
For your boy.

41:04.549 --> 41:07.484
- Uh, thanks, man.
- Better late than never, huh?

41:07.586 --> 41:10.282
Yeah. Uh-

41:10.389 --> 41:12.857
[Grunts]

41:12.958 --> 41:14.858
Ah, cute kid.

41:14.960 --> 41:17.656
- Yeah. He's got his mother's looks.
- Thank God.

41:19.664 --> 41:23.464
- Nice place.
- Yeah. The last one, uh, barely held two of us...

41:23.568 --> 41:25.559
- let alone a third.
- Hello, Vic.

41:28.273 --> 41:30.400
- [Mumbles]
- I think it's warm enough.

41:30.509 --> 41:33.171
Okay.

41:44.356 --> 41:48.986
- Is she all right?
- Yeah. Just a- a little postpartum. You know.

41:49.094 --> 41:51.062
Still adjusting.

41:51.163 --> 41:53.324
It's, uh-
It's a lot, you know.

41:53.432 --> 41:56.026
So what's up?

41:56.134 --> 41:59.968
Oh, we did pretty good on this thing,
you know. We stopped the war.

42:00.072 --> 42:03.007
- These seizures are real.
- [Baby Cries]

42:03.108 --> 42:05.474
- Farmington's gonna be the place to be-
- Hold on a second.

42:05.577 --> 42:07.511
Hold on, bud.
/t's comin /t's comin

42:07.646 --> 42:09.511

- Yeah. He's okay.

- / know. / know. /t's comin

42:11.750 --> 42:14.651

- /t's okay. / got it.

42:14.753 --> 42:17.278
Come on. Get dressed.
/'ll make you some lunch.

42:19.191 --> 42:22.024
So, what, uh-

42:22.127 --> 42:25.528
Uh, what about the, uh-
the seizures?

42:25.630 --> 42:27.689
I'm gonna need the best people
to make it happen.

42:27.799 --> 42:29.892
Our differences aside,
you're one of them.

42:30.001 --> 42:33.835
I got a good thing on Vice, you know.
My own boss. It's my own way of doing things.

42:33.939 --> 42:36.169
What exactly are you doin'?

42:36.274 --> 42:39.573
- I'm getting what I need done.
- I hope you're using protection.

42:39.678 --> 42:42.977
You lecturing me?
Man, you killed our team, not me.

42:44.683 --> 42:48.312
You're right.
Uh, I made some mistakes. I'll own that.

42:48.420 --> 42:50.547
- I'm past working for you, Vic.
- You wouldn't be.

42:50.655 --> 42:55.456
Uh, / got the watch, but the only person
you'd be taking orders from is the captain.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.326
- You still get to do things your way.
- / got a partner / trust now.

42:59.431 --> 43:01.729
And I really like
running with this guy, man.

43:01.833 --> 43:04.028
Well, I'll try to
bring him in too.

43:05.871 --> 43:08.965
You know, working out of the Barn
will make things easier on the family.

43:09.074 --> 43:11.975
Consistent hours.
Plenty of overtime if you need it.

without you.

43:17.149 --> 43:19.140

a lot of arrests.

43:19.251 --> 43:22.049
Well, you both did
a greatjob with this one.

- Thanks.

43:25.290 --> 43:28.657

I'll think about it.

43:30.562 --> 43:32.530
Good.

43:45.644 --> 43:48.078
I don't trust him.

43:48.180 --> 43:50.080
- Hey.
- [Gasps]

43:51.850 --> 43:54.876
It's not about
trust anymore, baby.

43:54.986 --> 43:57.682

Don't throw my peoples on the street.
l- I'll tell you everything.

44:13.438 --> 44:17.067
Too late now. The guy we wanted you to I.D.
is on the loose, probably dead.

44:17.175 --> 44:20.008
So what's gonna happen
to my mama house?

44:20.111 --> 44:22.773
You ain't even sorry,
are you?

44:22.881 --> 44:25.179
- We're done talking.
- You a white bitch!

44:25.283 --> 44:27.649

on the street.

Can I help you, Detective?

44:42.434 --> 44:45.528
My partner and I have been
on your office shit list for six months.

44:45.637 --> 44:47.537
Oh, I must have
missed that memo.

44:47.639 --> 44:50.233
- It needs to end.
- Well, you need to divorce your partner.

44:50.342 --> 44:52.674
What's it gonna take to get
the D.A. off her ass?

44:52.777 --> 44:56.372
Going into his office, getting on her hands
and knees and begging for his forgiveness.

44:56.481 --> 44:59.279
- She's not gonna do that.
- Then you're both in for a long winter.

44:59.384 --> 45:02.785
- I got work to do.
- Well, what if I, uh-

45:02.887 --> 45:05.822
What if I promise
to control her?

45:08.193 --> 45:11.026
- Are you sure you can do that?
- I wouldn't be here if I couldn't.

45:11.129 --> 45:13.154
She listens to me.

45:13.265 --> 45:16.132
Would that be enough?

45:16.234 --> 45:19.726
This office needs favors
from time to time.

deliver them when / ask.

All we need's a signature.

45:31.883 --> 45:35.114
Now this guy inside
says we might not.

45:35.220 --> 45:37.120
What's going on, Captain?

45:38.223 --> 45:40.157
Give me a minute. Okay?

45:40.258 --> 45:44.627

/t's all on the cart right there. Bring it down.

45:58.443 --> 46:00.343
Explain to me why
taking this house...

46:00.445 --> 46:03.346
was the right thing to do yesterday,
the wrong thing today.

46:03.448 --> 46:05.382
Yesterday we had to
stop the shootings.

46:07.919 --> 46:09.944
This house was bought
with drug money.

46:10.055 --> 46:11.989
The mother knew it.

46:12.090 --> 46:14.581
You said it would be
a P.R. nightmare.

46:19.364 --> 46:21.832
Either it works,
or it doesn't.

46:21.933 --> 46:25.232
To make exceptions to put
a prettier face on it...

46:26.971 --> 46:29.371

Aceveda than me.
