00:08.848 --> 00:12.284
'I had a really good year.
So why not reward myself?

00:12.603 --> 00:15.993
'So I bought a 48ft cabin cruiser.

00:16.318 --> 00:18.274
'I'll tell you how much it cost me,

00:18.530 --> 00:22.284
'300 grand plus $20,000
for the custom teak decking.

00:22.620 --> 00:24.611
'My problem is
that my wife wants to call

00:24.874 --> 00:28.025
'this incredible vessel "Lullubelle",
after her mother.

00:28.337 --> 00:31.613
"'Lullubelle!"
I want to call it "The Intrepid".

00:31.927 --> 00:35.761
'So, what do you think,
"Lullubelle" or "The Intrepid"?'

00:39.857 --> 00:45.090
At Cornell University, they have an
incredible piece of equipment known as

00:45.492 --> 00:48.052
the "tunnelling electron microscope."

00:48.329 --> 00:52.117
This microscope is so powerful
that by firing electrons,

00:52.461 --> 00:55.294
you can actually see
images of the atom,

00:55.591 --> 00:59.266
the minute building block
of our universe.

00:59.598 --> 01:02.271
If I were using
that microscope right now,

01:02.561 --> 01:07.112
I still wouldn't be able to locate
my interest in your problem.

01:11.242 --> 01:13.312
Thank you for your call.

01:14.998 --> 01:18.752
And now,
"Hungry for Chinese? I always..."

01:19.088 --> 01:21.841
I'm sorry.
We're experiencing technical difficulty.

01:22.135 --> 01:24.968
Let's go to a pre-recorded
commercial message.

01:26.809 --> 01:30.279
What's this?
I don't do personal endorsements.

01:30.607 --> 01:35.397
- The other personalities do them.
- They aren't doctors.

01:35.782 --> 01:39.491
If I allow myself to become a pitchman,
I lose all my credibility.

01:39.831 --> 01:42.140
I am a wise man, a shaman.

01:42.419 --> 01:44.979
Zip up your fly, wise man.

01:47.135 --> 01:50.332
Whoa! Doc, this is a radio studio,
not a bus terminal.

01:52.518 --> 01:54.793
Look who's here, NoÃ«l Coward.

01:55.064 --> 01:59.933
I hate to mix business with revulsion but
Frasier, as usual, will not do this promo.

02:00.323 --> 02:03.599
Love to, no problem.

02:03.912 --> 02:07.507
Doc, with all due respect,
you're an idiot.

02:07.835 --> 02:10.030
These promos are easy money.

02:10.298 --> 02:13.017
It's a question of integrity.

02:13.303 --> 02:16.420
Integrity. Hello!

02:16.725 --> 02:20.081
We're talking mucho dinero.

02:20.397 --> 02:24.390
But the more you turn these down,
the more Liver Snaps for the Bulldog.

02:24.738 --> 02:26.649
(Barks)

02:27.952 --> 02:30.307
What is this with my name on it?

02:30.581 --> 02:34.176
The Hunan Palace gig contract.
It's how much they'd pay you.

02:34.504 --> 02:39.897
- I'll change the name to "Bulldog".
- They pay you that much to read copy?

02:40.305 --> 02:42.899
Yes. Bulldog adds his special touch.

02:43.185 --> 02:44.459
(Gong)

02:44.688 --> 02:50.081
(Chinese accent) You will come,
chop chop to Hunan Palace,

02:50.489 --> 02:54.368
where Peking duck
is always extra crispy.

02:57.417 --> 03:00.807
(Duck whistle)

03:06.432 --> 03:08.707
We're gonna get sued
this time for sure.

03:10.000 --> 03:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:17.492 --> 03:21.451
Damn it! Put a dent in my bumper
when I pulled into my parking space.

03:21.790 --> 03:24.748
What happened to the tennis ball
I hung over my space

03:25.046 --> 03:27.002
so I wouldn't pull up too far?

03:35.438 --> 03:37.747
He was bored. He needed a toy.

03:38.026 --> 03:41.018
Go ahead and throw it.
He'll run and get it for you.

03:51.589 --> 03:55.343
He didn't think that was funny
and he knows where you sleep.

03:55.680 --> 03:58.990
A situation has arisen over at work,

03:59.310 --> 04:02.143
I'm not sure how it should be handled.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.557
Maybe your objective viewpoint
could be helpful.

04:05.864 --> 04:07.934
Sure.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.431
Should I publicly endorse a product?

04:11.748 --> 04:14.137
Oh, you mean like Cher does?

04:14.419 --> 04:17.377
Thank you, one against. Dad?

04:18.926 --> 04:23.522
- What's the product?
- It's for a Chinese restaurant.

04:23.893 --> 04:25.645
What's the problem?

04:25.897 --> 04:28.092
I hold a position of trust
in the community.

04:28.358 --> 04:32.749
People do what I tell them to
and I could be accused of abusing that.

04:33.116 --> 04:36.904
The thought of a doctor
selling things is distasteful.

04:37.248 --> 04:40.957
What about
Dr Sneezy's cold medicine?

04:41.297 --> 04:44.573
Dr Sneezy is a cartoon character.

04:46.680 --> 04:51.310
The fact that he's a giant purple hippo
should have tipped you off.

04:51.688 --> 04:53.918
Take the money and run.

04:54.193 --> 04:56.832
I'm tempted, mainly to keep Bulldog

04:57.114 --> 05:00.265
from alienating
the Asian-American community.

05:00.578 --> 05:03.172
I'd hate to compromise my principles.

05:04.835 --> 05:07.827
You've dedicated your life
to helping people, haven't you?

05:08.132 --> 05:10.123
Yes.

05:10.387 --> 05:14.221
If your listeners were in a quandary
over where to buy good Chinese food,

05:14.560 --> 05:16.710
your commercial would help them.

05:18.441 --> 05:21.160
Try the food, if you like it,
do the commercial.

05:21.446 --> 05:25.234
That's logical.
Why don't we all go tonight?

05:25.578 --> 05:28.775
I better make the reservations
under a different name.

05:29.084 --> 05:31.439
I don't want any special treatment.

05:31.713 --> 05:35.388
I want to be treated like
I'm just an average working Joe.

05:35.720 --> 05:38.234
Good evening. Yes, yes.

05:38.516 --> 05:41.155
We'd like a reservation
for three at 8:00.

05:41.438 --> 05:45.351
Oh, nothing till 10:00? Oh.

05:45.695 --> 05:48.163
Well, then, uh...

05:48.449 --> 05:50.963
This is Dr Frasier Crane,

05:52.706 --> 05:54.662
from the radio and...

05:54.919 --> 05:58.468
Yes, I thought you might.
Thank you.

05:58.799 --> 06:00.755
We're in at 9:45.

06:06.520 --> 06:12.072
Did I say tasty? Tasty doesn't do justice
to those succulent pot stickers.

06:12.489 --> 06:17.040
And the Kung Pao chicken.
Ooh, don't get me started.

06:17.413 --> 06:21.486
So if you've got a yen for Chinese,
hurry to the Hunan Palace.

06:21.837 --> 06:25.227
This is Dr Frasier Crane
hoping we'll see you tomorrow

06:25.551 --> 06:28.429
on KACL 780AM.

06:30.936 --> 06:36.329
I'm getting the knack for these promos.
Did you hear my "yen" ad lib?

06:36.737 --> 06:40.810
Yeah. By the way,
"yen" is Japanese, not Chinese.

06:43.456 --> 06:46.254
I got a call from the Hunan palace
the other day.

06:46.545 --> 06:50.458
Since I started these commercials,
their business has gone up by 30%.

06:50.802 --> 06:54.795
- Isn't that what advertising does?
- Yes, it is, Miss Sour Britches.

06:55.143 --> 06:57.532
Give me a little credit.

06:57.813 --> 07:01.965
I please the boys upstairs,
I got people to try a new restaurant,

07:02.321 --> 07:05.552
and I've helped
a struggling immigrant family

07:05.869 --> 07:08.224
who came to these shores
12 years ago

07:08.497 --> 07:13.969
with little more than a dream,
a few recipes and a wok.

07:18.222 --> 07:21.658
- Dr Crane, what a privilege this is.
- Excuse me?

07:21.978 --> 07:26.768
- Bebe Glazer, Bulldog Brisco's agent.
- Pleasure meeting you.

07:27.153 --> 07:32.181
I'm usually not this forward,
but I know nobody represents you.

07:32.579 --> 07:36.174
How would you feel about signing on
with me as a client?

07:36.503 --> 07:40.291
- No, I don't think so.
- Why?

07:40.634 --> 07:46.425
I am flattered. But I'm not really
a radio personality per se.

07:46.852 --> 07:50.049
I've heard those spots
you've done for that restaurant.

07:50.359 --> 07:55.035
You make me want to stuff my face
full of egg rolls and... I don't know what.

07:57.704 --> 07:59.660
Thank you, eh...

07:59.916 --> 08:03.386
but, I dine
at the Hunan Palace frequently

08:03.714 --> 08:05.830
that's why I did those commercials.

08:06.093 --> 08:09.165
I don't want you to advertise
something you don't believe in.

08:09.473 --> 08:14.547
- I am an agent, not a pimp.
- I don't mean to offend...

08:14.941 --> 08:19.139
- You're terrific. Here's my card.
- That's not necessary...

08:19.489 --> 08:21.525
Give me back my card.

08:21.785 --> 08:25.334
It is too refreshing to meet someone

08:25.666 --> 08:29.215
not seduced by the almighty dollar.
I would refuse your call.

08:29.548 --> 08:34.702
I've got to go, flying to Palo Alto.
My daughter's at Stanford.

08:35.099 --> 08:39.775
Ah. Wait.
You don't have kids, do you?

08:40.149 --> 08:44.700
- I have a five-year-old son.
- You won't have to worry about it yet.

08:45.074 --> 08:49.033
- Worry about what?
- Tuition, innocent.

08:49.373 --> 08:53.446
Ah, you're going to send him
to a state college.

08:53.797 --> 08:58.154
No, I had planned to send him
to my alma mater, Harvard.

08:58.513 --> 09:03.109
Ouch. Kiss it and make it better.

09:04.648 --> 09:08.561
Have you seen the projections
for college costs the year 2010?

09:11.367 --> 09:14.882
I've got to go.
That plane is not going to wait for me.

09:15.207 --> 09:17.641
Maybe we should talk sometime.

09:18.963 --> 09:20.919
Let's talk now.

09:21.175 --> 09:25.487
I think I can die peacefully
without seeing the Stanford-Cal game.

09:25.850 --> 09:27.841
I don't object to doing commercials,

09:28.103 --> 09:32.221
but I'd have to try a product first
before I could endorse it.

09:32.569 --> 09:36.528
Dr Crane,
I wouldn't have it any other way.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.468
(Bubbling water)

09:42.836 --> 09:45.191
Why am I here?

09:45.465 --> 09:50.380
If I do the commercial, I have to say
my friends and family enjoy this.

09:50.766 --> 09:53.678
I feel silly in this showroom.

09:53.979 --> 09:56.698
I apologise,
but it's the best place to try.

09:58.737 --> 10:01.046
Aren't you enjoying this?

10:01.325 --> 10:03.634
I do like the bubbles.

10:03.912 --> 10:09.384
It's a little like sitting in hot champagne.
Not that I've done that very much.

10:10.757 --> 10:16.627
It's made from the same space-age
polymer as the NASA space shuttles?

10:17.059 --> 10:21.928
Next time I'm re-entering the Earth's
atmosphere in a hot tub, I won't worry.

10:22.317 --> 10:24.672
Well, do you like it?

10:26.658 --> 10:29.252
It is making my hip feel a little better.

10:29.538 --> 10:33.372
So my friends like it,
my family likes it, I like it.

10:33.711 --> 10:38.068
I can do the commercial
and Frederick can go to Harvard.

10:38.970 --> 10:42.326
Oh, my God, isn't that Dave Hendler
from our building?

10:42.642 --> 10:48.194
You know he's the head of
the Seattle Psychiatric Association!

10:50.321 --> 10:53.279
- That's not Dave Hendler.
- Shh, don't worry about it.

10:53.578 --> 10:55.933
Enjoy the quiet while you can.

11:02.133 --> 11:06.763
'Gentle, soothing bubbles,
bubbles that will ease your aching body.

11:07.141 --> 11:10.929
'This is Dr Frasier Crane.
In these pressure-packed times,

11:11.273 --> 11:15.869
'what could be better than a relaxing dip
in a Redwood hot tub?

11:16.239 --> 11:20.232
'Let Redwood's patented 'Ultra-Blow'
air system surround your body.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.573
- 'My family and friends like it.'
- That's us.

11:24.921 --> 11:28.914
'lf you act quickly, you'll receive
a complimentary scum guard.

11:32.266 --> 11:37.101
'Hurry to your local Redwood hot tub
dealer. Say Frasier Crane sent you'

11:37.483 --> 11:41.442
- What did you think?
- I could almost smell the chlorine.

11:42.867 --> 11:46.860
- Dad, how about you?
- I liked it.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.244
- You REALLY liked it?
- No, I liked it.

11:50.547 --> 11:52.902
- What was wrong with it?
- Nothing!

11:53.175 --> 11:55.291
- You hated it?
- Yeah.

11:56.597 --> 11:58.553
(Doorbell)

12:05.195 --> 12:07.311
- Hello, darling.
- Bebe!

12:07.575 --> 12:10.373
Mea culpa
for dropping by unannounced

12:10.663 --> 12:12.893
you'll kiss me
when you hear what I've done.

12:14.294 --> 12:15.966
Oh...

12:19.135 --> 12:21.251
Hello.

12:21.514 --> 12:26.986
No, no, this is Daphne Moon,
my father's physical therapist.

12:27.398 --> 12:29.958
Oh!

12:30.236 --> 12:33.194
So, I was about
to kiss you for something.

12:33.492 --> 12:38.805
Well, I got a very attractive offer
for you to be a product spokesman

12:39.210 --> 12:41.519
and we know they're serious,
cos it's "pay or play".

12:41.797 --> 12:45.073
You get your money
whether you do it or not.

12:45.386 --> 12:48.139
- Listen.
- How do you know?

12:48.433 --> 12:52.711
I must confess,
there is a chapter of my life

12:53.066 --> 12:55.864
I haven't told you or your father about.

12:56.154 --> 12:59.510
When I was 12,
I starred in a TV show in England.

12:59.827 --> 13:04.025
- I'll leave you to your business.
- Get back here. You what?

13:04.377 --> 13:08.336
I starred in a TV series.
It was quite popular in its day.

13:08.675 --> 13:12.634
Maybe you've heard of it,
"Mind Your Knickers"?

13:12.974 --> 13:16.171
It was about a group of high-spirited
ethnically diverse

13:16.479 --> 13:19.232
12-year-olds in a girls private school.

13:19.526 --> 13:21.756
I played Emma, the short, spunky one.

13:22.030 --> 13:25.784
By the end of the series,
I was 16, 5ft 10in,

13:26.121 --> 13:30.273
and they had my boozies
bound up tighter than a mummy.

13:30.628 --> 13:33.381
Well, I'm off.

13:35.219 --> 13:37.175
The woman is like an artichoke.

13:37.431 --> 13:42.061
You just keep peeling away
one astounding leaf after another.

13:42.439 --> 13:45.033
Back to business. What have you got?

13:45.319 --> 13:47.753
Voila Emery's nuts!

13:48.032 --> 13:50.671
No, I can't endorse these.

13:50.953 --> 13:54.309
- Why not?
- I don't like them.

13:54.626 --> 13:58.539
They're 60% fat, laced with salt
and wreak havoc with my diverticulitis.

13:58.883 --> 14:04.116
- Of course they do, they're nuts.
- Sorry, I'm afraid I can't.

14:04.517 --> 14:06.747
Well...

14:07.021 --> 14:12.334
I will just tell them they can take their
five-figure deal and find someone else.

14:12.739 --> 14:17.733
- Five figures.
- This is for TV, the Big Kahuna.

14:18.122 --> 14:20.431
Television.

14:20.710 --> 14:24.100
But I understand if you have a problem.

14:24.425 --> 14:29.658
Well, I...I...
I don't mean to be difficult.

14:30.059 --> 14:35.179
I only endorse things I like
or that are therapeutic, like the hot tub.

14:35.569 --> 14:38.686
Let me pinch you. You're not real!

14:39.658 --> 14:41.376
Well...

14:41.620 --> 14:45.169
But still, I wonder if you're not being

14:45.501 --> 14:48.777
just the tiniest bit short-sighted.

14:49.091 --> 14:51.605
Research has shown
that a single TV commercial

14:51.886 --> 14:56.243
can turn an obscure radio personality
into a national celebrity!

14:56.603 --> 15:01.723
A year from now, you could be
broadcasting your message of healing

15:02.112 --> 15:06.105
not just to the Pacific Northwest
but to the entire nation.

15:09.708 --> 15:14.304
But, of course,
there's not much I can do about it

15:14.674 --> 15:18.633
if you don't like the product.

15:47.854 --> 15:51.529
I've never been
100% happy with my nose.

15:52.862 --> 15:55.899
You can't be serious.
That's a nose people trust.

15:57.787 --> 16:00.221
Your script! Thanks Jeff.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.536
I've seen it. You're going to love it.

16:02.795 --> 16:05.593
"Two nuts are arguing with each other."

16:07.052 --> 16:09.407
"I'm a nut." "No, I'm a nut."

16:09.682 --> 16:11.638
That's funny.

16:12.812 --> 16:16.521
"Hold it. You're both nuts.
I'm Dr Frasier Crane, a psychiatrist,

16:16.861 --> 16:19.580
and I know a nut when I see one."

16:21.785 --> 16:23.741
I don't know about that line.

16:23.997 --> 16:28.229
- Oh. What's wrong? It's a scream.
- Maybe, but it's...

16:28.588 --> 16:31.102
What's the word I'm looking for?

16:31.384 --> 16:35.343
What, "tuition",
"retirement beach house"?

16:38.813 --> 16:40.883
I'm so sorry.

16:41.150 --> 16:45.268
I'm so sorry. It's just
that I want so much for you.

16:45.616 --> 16:50.406
I don't mean to be difficult,
but I'm not comfortable with this line.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.545
Frasier, Frasier, Frasier.

16:53.838 --> 16:58.275
- How long have we been together?
- Six days.

16:58.638 --> 17:02.392
Would I ever have you do something
you were uncomfortable with?

17:02.727 --> 17:07.881
It's wonderful because you're showing
that psychiatrists can be loose,

17:08.278 --> 17:10.916
making shrinks
more accessible to people.

17:11.200 --> 17:14.909
So I'd be doing psychiatry a service?

17:15.248 --> 17:19.526
You have a way of cutting through
the baloney that knocks me out cold.

17:24.387 --> 17:29.098
Oh dear, what does this mean,
"Frasier comes out of his shell"?

17:29.480 --> 17:33.109
It's a... A technical term...
it's a lighting thing.

17:33.445 --> 17:39.281
You see, you come out of your shadow
or your shell, into the light.

17:42.001 --> 17:45.630
I have so much to learn
about this business.

17:51.099 --> 17:53.693
Niles, I have to talk to you.

17:53.979 --> 17:56.413
What's that ridiculous tissue?

17:56.691 --> 18:00.240
They didn't tell me I could take it off,
so I kept it on.

18:00.573 --> 18:04.282
Silly me,
I thought it was to grab attention

18:04.622 --> 18:06.499
so people say, "Are you an actor?"

18:06.750 --> 18:09.708
Affording you the opportunity
to say you are an actor

18:10.005 --> 18:14.442
and then crow, gloat and strut
in a way you could not otherwise do.

18:14.805 --> 18:19.242
And the reason you have "shrink"
on your licence plate would be?

18:21.232 --> 18:23.666
I have this commercial in half an hour,

18:23.945 --> 18:25.901
I don't think I can go through with it.

18:26.157 --> 18:28.387
I'm afraid
I'm compromising my integrity.

18:28.661 --> 18:32.813
- Why do you feel like that?
- My co-stars are almonds and walnuts.

18:33.168 --> 18:36.205
Listen Niles, I need your guidance.

18:36.507 --> 18:40.466
- I don't see this as a problem.
- This isn't selling out?

18:40.806 --> 18:45.004
Oh, no. You sold out a long time ago.

18:45.355 --> 18:48.631
Your call-in show was selling out.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.900
You are such a purist.

18:51.157 --> 18:53.113
OK, I can't do in-depth analysis,

18:53.368 --> 18:56.678
but my show
helps thousands of people.

18:57.000 --> 19:00.754
You talk about wanting to safeguard
your professional dignity.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.240
When you went on the air,
you left medicine for show biz.

19:06.014 --> 19:09.006
Like that movie star
who let everyone look up her skirt

19:09.312 --> 19:11.906
then complained
nobody took her seriously.

19:12.191 --> 19:16.230
- That has nothing to do with it.
- Have you seen that movie?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.564
Maris and I rented the video.

19:18.911 --> 19:22.870
I don't mind telling you
we pushed our beds together that night.

19:32.558 --> 19:36.836
And that was no mean feat.
Her room is across the hall.

19:38.985 --> 19:41.180
Just tell me, would you do it?

19:41.447 --> 19:43.756
A nude scene?
If it were integral to...

19:44.035 --> 19:47.311
No! This commercial!

19:47.624 --> 19:50.422
No, I'm a respected psychiatrist.

19:50.712 --> 19:53.385
You mean I shouldn't do it?

19:53.676 --> 19:56.474
No. I'm saying it doesn't matter.

19:56.764 --> 19:59.324
They've already looked up your skirt

19:59.602 --> 20:02.355
and they've seen
everything there is to see.

20:21.598 --> 20:23.634
What are you still doing up?

20:23.893 --> 20:28.364
Oh, geez, you're not watching that tape
of that dumb commercial again!

20:28.734 --> 20:32.090
I can't get it off my mind.
Did I do the right thing?

20:32.407 --> 20:35.444
Of course, Freddy will thank you for it.

20:35.746 --> 20:38.499
Watch it with me one more time.

20:40.795 --> 20:42.751
'I'm a nut.'

20:43.007 --> 20:44.998
'No, I'm a nut.'

20:45.261 --> 20:48.173
-' No, I'm a nut.'
- 'I'm a nut.'

20:48.475 --> 20:50.705
'Stop! You're both nuts.

20:52.607 --> 20:54.757
'I'm a psychologist,
Dr Joyce Brothers.

20:55.027 --> 20:59.305
'I'm here to tell you
that I'm just crazy about Emery's nuts.

20:59.660 --> 21:04.529
'So, if you're crazy about nuts too,
pick up a can of Emery's today.

21:04.919 --> 21:07.991
'Emery's, the nut lover's nut.'

21:12.807 --> 21:15.844
I suppose you're right. Dad.
Freddy will thank me.

21:16.145 --> 21:18.898
Dr Joyce is his favourite psychologist.

21:20.319 --> 21:23.436
I remember Dr Joyce
from "The Hollywood Squares".

21:23.741 --> 21:26.858
She was always under Charlie Weaver.

21:27.164 --> 21:29.678
No, Weaver was always on the bottom.

21:29.960 --> 21:32.599
No, let's see,
Paul Lynde was in the middle.

21:32.882 --> 21:36.079
George Gobel was on the end
and where was Wally Cox?

21:36.387 --> 21:39.345
Wally Cox...upper left
next to Rose Marie to block.

21:43.733 --> 21:48.329
# Hey baby, I hear the blues a-calling
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

21:48.699 --> 21:50.257
# Quite stylish

21:50.493 --> 21:55.362
# Maybe I seem a bit confused,
Well, maybe...but I got you pegged!

21:58.006 --> 22:02.397
# But I don't know what to do with those
Tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:04.058 --> 22:07.095
# They're calling again
Good night, everybody! #
