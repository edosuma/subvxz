00:42.500 --> 00:45.856
You know, Daddy,
this is my very best birthday.

00:45.900 --> 00:49.017
Ah, but I haven't given you
your present yet.

00:49.060 --> 00:52.769
- What is it? What is it?
- Now, now, close your eyes.

00:52.819 --> 00:56.209
Ah, ah, ah, och, now.
No peeking now.

01:08.617 --> 01:13.327
Ohh, Daddy!
You made this just for me?

01:26.975 --> 01:32.368
You're the most wonderful father
in the... in the whole world!

01:37.014 --> 01:39.244
Oh! Who's that?

01:41.053 --> 01:42.725
I... I don't know!

01:42.773 --> 01:46.448
Quickly, dear. Stay in here
and don't come out.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.845
Gotcha, toymaker!

02:01.891 --> 02:03.290
Olivia!

02:10.369 --> 02:13.281
Daddy! Where are you?

02:14.889 --> 02:17.040
Daddy!

02:17.090 --> 02:18.761
Where are you?

02:21.769 --> 02:23.281
Daddy!

03:08.083 --> 03:12.042
It was the eve of our good
Queen's Diamond Jubilee...

03:12.083 --> 03:14.642
and the year
Her Majesty's government...

03:14.682 --> 03:17.912
came to the very brink
of disaster.

03:17.962 --> 03:19.474
She...

03:22.441 --> 03:24.636
I'm getting ahead of myself.

03:24.681 --> 03:27.797
My name is Dr David Q. Dawson...

03:27.840 --> 03:31.071
most recently of
the Queen's 66th Regiment.

03:37.679 --> 03:39.955
I had just arrived in London...

03:40.000 --> 03:42.877
after lengthy service
in Afghanistan...

03:42.919 --> 03:45.637
and was anxious
to find a quiet place...

03:45.678 --> 03:49.034
yes, preferably dry...

03:49.078 --> 03:53.356
where I could rest
and find a bit of peace.

03:53.397 --> 03:55.957
Little did I know...

03:55.997 --> 04:00.433
but my life
was about to change forever.

04:14.795 --> 04:17.308
Oh! Oh, my!

04:21.194 --> 04:24.072
Are you all right, my dear?

04:25.513 --> 04:28.471
Oh, come now. Come, come, come.
Here, here. Dry your eyes.

04:33.033 --> 04:35.785
Ah, yes. Now, that's better.

04:35.832 --> 04:40.347
Now, tell me...
what's troubling you, my dear?

04:40.392 --> 04:43.189
I... I'm lost.

04:43.230 --> 04:48.668
I... I'm trying to find
Basil of Baker Street.

04:48.711 --> 04:51.270
Oh, let me see.

04:51.310 --> 04:55.667
"Famous Detective Solves
Baffling Disappearance."

04:55.709 --> 05:00.703
Mm-hmm. But where are
your mother and father?

05:00.749 --> 05:04.503
That's why I m-must find Basil!

05:04.549 --> 05:07.142
There, there, there.
Now, now, now... I...

05:07.188 --> 05:09.621
Well, now,
I don't know any Basil.

05:15.068 --> 05:17.900
But I do remember
where Baker Street is.

05:17.947 --> 05:20.859
Now come with me.

05:20.907 --> 05:23.898
We'll find this Basil chap
together.

05:56.062 --> 05:57.541
Good evening, madam.

05:57.582 --> 06:00.379
Is this the residence
of Basil of Baker Street?

06:00.421 --> 06:04.210
I'm afraid it is.
He's not here at the moment...

06:04.262 --> 06:06.456
but you're welcome
to come in and wait.

06:06.501 --> 06:09.095
Oh, I don't want to impose.

06:09.141 --> 06:12.496
It's just the girl...

06:15.699 --> 06:22.218
Oh, my! You poor dear.
You must be chilled to the bone.

06:22.260 --> 06:25.137
Ohh, but I know just the thing.

06:25.179 --> 06:27.295
Let me fetch you a pot of tea...

06:27.339 --> 06:29.613
and some of
my fresh cheese crumpets.

06:48.816 --> 06:51.455
Aha! The villain's
slipped this time!

06:51.496 --> 06:52.894
I shall have him!

06:55.176 --> 06:56.971
Out of my way! Out of my way!

06:57.014 --> 06:58.447
I say... Ooh!

06:59.655 --> 07:01.247
Who are you?

07:01.295 --> 07:04.207
What? Oh!

07:04.254 --> 07:06.767
Basil of Baker Street,
my good fellow.

07:11.693 --> 07:14.161
Mr Basil,
I need your help, and...

07:14.213 --> 07:15.725
All in good time.

07:15.772 --> 07:18.650
But... but you don't understand.
I'm in terrible trouble.

07:18.692 --> 07:19.885
If you'll excuse me.

07:23.571 --> 07:26.962
Now... now... now, see here!

07:27.011 --> 07:29.764
This young lady
is in need of assistance.

07:29.811 --> 07:31.961
- I think you ought to listen.
- Hold this, please, Doctor.

07:32.011 --> 07:35.162
Of course.

07:35.210 --> 07:36.848
Now wait just a moment.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.845
How the deuce
did you know I was a doctor?

07:38.890 --> 07:40.243
A surgeon to be exact.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.803
Just returned from
military duty in Afghanistan.

07:42.850 --> 07:44.044
Am I right?

07:44.090 --> 07:46.602
Why, yes.

07:46.648 --> 07:51.483
Major David Q. Dawson.
But how could you possibly...

07:51.528 --> 07:54.247
Quite simple, really. You've
sewn your torn cuff together...

07:54.287 --> 07:57.280
with a Lambert stitch, which,
of course, only a surgeon uses.

07:57.328 --> 07:59.840
And the thread
is a unique form of cat-gut...

07:59.887 --> 08:02.766
easily distinguished
by its peculiar pungency...

08:02.807 --> 08:04.923
found only
in the Afghan provinces.

08:07.366 --> 08:08.640
Amazing.

08:08.686 --> 08:11.564
Actually, it's elementary,
my dear Dawson.

08:19.485 --> 08:20.964
What in heaven's name?

08:22.685 --> 08:26.563
My... my good pillows!

08:26.603 --> 08:30.040
Mr Basil! Pfft! How many times
have I told you...

08:30.084 --> 08:33.155
There, there, Mrs Judson,
it's quite all right.

08:33.203 --> 08:35.158
Mmm.
I believe I smell...

08:35.202 --> 08:37.592
some of those delightful
cheese crumpets of yours.

08:37.642 --> 08:39.599
Why don't you fetch
our guests some?

08:39.643 --> 08:41.201
But... but I...

08:41.241 --> 08:45.520
Now, I know that bullet's
here somewhere.

08:45.561 --> 08:48.280
Here... Thank you, Miss.

08:48.322 --> 08:51.119
Flaversham. Olivia Flaversham.

08:51.161 --> 08:54.630
- Whatever.
- Yes, but you don't understand.

09:16.238 --> 09:19.036
Another dead end.

09:22.756 --> 09:25.794
He was within my grasp!

09:40.995 --> 09:43.111
Now will you please
listen to me?

09:43.155 --> 09:47.068
My daddy's gone,
and I'm all alone.

09:47.115 --> 09:51.471
Young lady, this is
a most inopportune time.

09:55.873 --> 09:58.671
Surely your mother knows
where he is.

09:58.713 --> 10:01.545
I... I don't have a mother.

10:03.072 --> 10:08.385
Well, um, then perhaps...

10:08.432 --> 10:12.470
See here, I simply have
no time for lost fathers.

10:12.511 --> 10:15.264
I didn't lose him!
He was taken by a bat!

10:16.550 --> 10:19.064
- Did you say "bat"?
- Yes.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.749
Did he have a crippled wing?

10:20.791 --> 10:23.350
I don't know,
but he had a peg leg!

10:24.389 --> 10:26.664
I say, do you know him?

10:26.709 --> 10:30.383
Know him?
That bat, one Fidget by name...

10:30.428 --> 10:32.340
is in the employ
of the very fiend...

10:32.389 --> 10:33.980
who was the target
of my experiment!

10:34.028 --> 10:36.064
The horror
of my every waking moment!

10:36.108 --> 10:39.259
The nefarious Professor Ratigan!

10:42.787 --> 10:44.425
Ratigan?

10:44.466 --> 10:48.983
He's a genius, Dawson.
A genius twisted for evil.

10:49.026 --> 10:50.937
The Napoleon of crime!

10:50.986 --> 10:53.261
As bad as all that, eh?

10:53.305 --> 10:56.502
Worse! For years
I've tried to capture him...

10:56.545 --> 10:58.740
and I've come close,
so very close...

10:58.785 --> 11:02.619
but each time
he's narrowly evaded my grasp.

11:02.665 --> 11:04.859
Not a corner of London's safe...

11:04.904 --> 11:08.055
while Ratigan's at large.

11:08.105 --> 11:11.221
There's no evil scheme
he wouldn't concoct...

11:11.264 --> 11:15.176
no depravity
he wouldn't commit.

11:15.223 --> 11:17.817
Who knows
what dastardly scheme...

11:17.863 --> 11:20.296
that villain may be plotting...

11:20.342 --> 11:23.380
even as we speak.

11:46.900 --> 11:50.129
Quite an ingenious scheme,
eh, Flaversham?

11:50.178 --> 11:54.536
And aren't you proud
to be a part of it?

11:54.579 --> 11:57.729
This whole thing,
it's... it's monstrous.

11:57.779 --> 11:59.814
We will have
our little device...

11:59.857 --> 12:03.248
ready by tomorrow evening,
won't we?

12:03.297 --> 12:07.848
You know what will happen
if you... fail.

12:09.857 --> 12:12.894
I... I... I don't care!

12:27.615 --> 12:30.333
You can do
what you want with me.

12:30.374 --> 12:34.333
I won't be a part
of this... this evil any longer!

12:36.773 --> 12:41.448
Oh, very well,
if that is your decision.

12:41.493 --> 12:45.406
Oh, by the way,
I'm taking the liberty...

12:45.452 --> 12:48.489
of having your daughter
brought here.

12:50.851 --> 12:55.561
Yes. I would spend
many a sleepless night...

12:55.611 --> 13:00.731
if anything unfortunate
were to befall her.

13:00.771 --> 13:03.569
You... you wouldn't!

13:13.368 --> 13:14.960
Finish it, Flaversham!

13:23.408 --> 13:26.399
Oh, I love it when I'm nasty.

13:26.447 --> 13:28.802
Fidget.

13:34.846 --> 13:38.521
Bright and alert as always.
Here's the list.

13:38.566 --> 13:41.205
You know what to do,
and no mistakes!

13:43.085 --> 13:44.439
No... no mistakes.

13:47.204 --> 13:48.432
Now, Fidget!

13:48.484 --> 13:50.999
I'm going! I'm going! I'm going!

14:10.922 --> 14:16.200
My friends, we are about
to embark on the most odious...

14:16.240 --> 14:18.994
the most evil,
the most diabolical scheme...

14:19.041 --> 14:21.679
of my illustrious career.

14:21.721 --> 14:23.870
A crime to top all crimes.

14:23.920 --> 14:26.673
A crime
that will live in infamy!

14:29.120 --> 14:32.156
Tomorrow evening,
our beloved monarch...

14:32.199 --> 14:35.875
celebrates her Diamond Jubilee.

14:35.920 --> 14:39.036
And with
the enthusiastic help...

14:39.078 --> 14:41.991
of our good friend,
Mr Flaversham...

14:43.358 --> 14:48.431
it promises to be a night
she will never forget.

14:48.477 --> 14:52.470
Her last night and my first...

14:52.517 --> 14:57.352
as Supreme Ruler
of all mousedom!

15:10.155 --> 15:11.712
# From the brain
that brought you #

15:11.755 --> 15:13.585
# The Big Ben caper #

15:13.634 --> 15:16.592
# The head that made headlines
in every newspaper #

15:16.634 --> 15:19.910
# And wondrous things
like the Tower Bridge job #

15:19.954 --> 15:23.309
# That cunning display
that made Londoners sob #

15:23.354 --> 15:25.548
# Now comes
the real tour de force #

15:25.593 --> 15:28.790
# Tricky and wicked,
of course #

15:28.833 --> 15:32.347
# My earlier crimes
were fine for their times #

15:32.392 --> 15:35.464
# But now
that I'm at it again #

15:35.512 --> 15:38.584
# An even grimmer plot
has been simmering #

15:38.632 --> 15:41.464
# In my great criminal brain #

15:41.511 --> 15:45.106
# Even meaner? You mean it? #

15:45.150 --> 15:47.948
# Worse than the widows
and orphans you drowned? #

15:47.990 --> 15:50.788
# You're the best
of the worst around #

15:50.830 --> 15:52.182
# Oh, Ratigan #

15:52.229 --> 15:53.743
# Oh, Ratigan #

15:53.790 --> 15:57.100
# The rest fall behind #

15:57.149 --> 16:00.027
# To Ratigan, to Ratigan #

16:00.069 --> 16:03.425
# The world's greatest
criminal mind #

16:04.949 --> 16:07.781
Thank you, thank you...

16:07.828 --> 16:11.376
but it hasn't all been
champagne and caviar.

16:11.427 --> 16:13.941
I've had my share
of adversity...

16:13.987 --> 16:17.376
thanks to that miserable,
second-rate detective...

16:17.426 --> 16:19.382
Basil of Baker Street!

16:21.226 --> 16:24.536
For years,
that insufferable pipsqueak...

16:24.586 --> 16:27.145
has interfered with my plans...

16:27.186 --> 16:30.540
and I haven't had
a moment's peace of mind.

16:34.904 --> 16:37.576
But all that's in the past.

16:37.623 --> 16:39.421
This time, nothing...

16:39.464 --> 16:43.093
not even Basil,
can stand in my way!

16:43.144 --> 16:45.976
All will bow before me.

16:46.023 --> 16:47.502
# Oh, Ratigan #

16:47.543 --> 16:49.215
# Oh, Ratigan #

16:49.263 --> 16:52.174
# You're tops,
and that's that #

16:52.222 --> 16:55.373
# To Ratigan, to Ratigan #

16:55.422 --> 16:57.889
# To Ratigan,
the world's greatest rat #

17:01.341 --> 17:03.570
What was that?

17:04.942 --> 17:07.135
What did you call me?

17:07.180 --> 17:08.771
Oh, he didn't mean it,
Professor.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.651
It was just
a slip of the tongue!

17:10.700 --> 17:12.019
I am not a rat!

17:12.060 --> 17:13.617
'Course you're not.
You're a mouse.

17:13.659 --> 17:16.492
- That's right. Right, a mouse.
- Yeah! A big mouse!

17:16.540 --> 17:17.813
Silence!

17:22.018 --> 17:24.373
Oh, my dear Bartholomew.

17:24.417 --> 17:28.650
I'm afraid that
you've gone and upset me.

17:28.698 --> 17:32.815
You know what happens
when someone upsets me.

17:48.015 --> 17:51.564
# Oh, Ratigan, oh, Ratigan #

17:51.615 --> 17:55.290
# You're the tops,
and that's that #

17:56.574 --> 17:59.965
# To Ratigan, to Ratigan #

18:00.014 --> 18:03.290
# To Ratigan #

18:03.333 --> 18:07.486
# The world's greatest... #

18:15.532 --> 18:20.208
Tsk, tsk, tsk. Oh, Felicia,
my precious. My baby.

18:20.251 --> 18:24.039
Did Daddy's little honeybun
enjoy her tasty treat?

18:26.651 --> 18:31.485
I trust there will be
no further interruptions.

18:31.530 --> 18:37.638
Ahem. And now,
as you were singing...

18:39.329 --> 18:42.287
# Even louder,
let's shout it #

18:42.329 --> 18:46.208
# No one can doubt
what we know you can do #

18:46.248 --> 18:48.603
# You're more evil
than even you #

18:48.648 --> 18:50.206
# Oh, Ratigan #

18:50.248 --> 18:52.079
# Oh, Ratigan #

18:52.128 --> 18:55.120
# You're one of a kind #

18:55.168 --> 18:58.204
# To Ratigan, to Ratigan #

18:58.247 --> 19:08.201
# The world's greatest
criminal mind #

19:12.925 --> 19:15.485
This case is most intriguing...

19:15.524 --> 19:17.481
with its multiplicity
of elements...

19:17.524 --> 19:19.959
its many twists and turns.

19:20.005 --> 19:23.553
Now, you're certain
you told me everything?

19:23.603 --> 19:26.481
The slightest detail
may be important.

19:26.523 --> 19:30.311
It's just as I said.
And then my father was gone.

19:30.363 --> 19:32.240
What do you make of it?

19:32.283 --> 19:35.355
Mmm, Ratigan's up to something.

19:35.403 --> 19:38.917
A crime of the most
sinister nature, no doubt.

19:38.962 --> 19:44.558
The question is, what would
he want with a toymaker?

19:50.721 --> 19:52.756
Quickly, Dawson!
We've not a moment to lose!

19:52.800 --> 19:55.235
I... I'm right behind you, Basil!

19:59.680 --> 20:03.149
No sign of
the blackguard anywhere.

20:03.199 --> 20:05.918
Not quite, Dawson. He left
some rather unusual footprints.

20:05.959 --> 20:08.950
They obviously belong
to the same fiend...

20:08.998 --> 20:13.514
who abducted the girl's father...
Ratigan's peg-legged lackey!

20:17.957 --> 20:19.868
Excellent work, old man!

20:21.676 --> 20:26.670
Now, there's nothing
to be afraid of, my dear.

20:29.595 --> 20:31.028
The scoundrel's quite gone.

20:31.075 --> 20:33.590
Ah ha ha, but not for long,
Miss Flamhammer.

20:33.636 --> 20:35.115
- Flaversham!
- Whatever.

20:35.155 --> 20:37.464
Now, we simply pursue
our peg-legged friend...

20:37.514 --> 20:40.551
until he leads us
to the girl's father.

20:40.594 --> 20:42.391
Then you'll get my daddy back?

20:42.434 --> 20:45.073
Yes...

20:45.114 --> 20:49.107
and quite soon,
if I'm not mistaken.

20:49.154 --> 20:53.112
Now, hurry along, Dawson.
Must be off to Toby's.

20:53.153 --> 20:55.189
- Toby's?
- Oh, you must meet him.

20:55.233 --> 20:58.542
- He's just the chap for this.
- You... you want me to come?

20:58.592 --> 21:01.311
Ha, I should think a stout-
hearted army mouse like you...

21:01.352 --> 21:03.820
would leap at the chance
for adventure.

21:03.872 --> 21:05.987
Well, I am rather curious.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.226
Wait for me! I'm coming, too!

21:10.672 --> 21:13.980
What? Certainly not. This is
no business for children.

21:14.030 --> 21:16.703
Are we going to take a cab?

21:16.750 --> 21:21.698
Ohh. My dear,
I don't think you understand.

21:21.749 --> 21:25.105
It will be quite dangerous.

21:27.828 --> 21:30.103
Why, you... Look...

21:32.548 --> 21:34.458
Young lady...

21:34.507 --> 21:37.898
you are most definitely
not accompanying us...

21:37.948 --> 21:40.142
and that is final!

21:46.626 --> 21:49.663
And not a word out of you...

21:49.706 --> 21:52.015
is that clear?

21:52.066 --> 21:53.624
I observe
that there is a good deal...

21:53.666 --> 21:55.145
of German music on the program.

21:55.186 --> 21:59.144
It is introspective,
and I want to introspect.

21:59.185 --> 22:02.654
But, Holmes, that music
is so frightfully dull.

22:02.705 --> 22:04.024
Come on.

22:17.422 --> 22:18.650
Toby!

22:23.662 --> 22:25.617
Who is Toby?

22:25.662 --> 22:29.370
Well, my dear, Toby is...
Well, he's, uh...

22:30.541 --> 22:33.135
I say, Basil,
who is this Toby chap?

22:34.660 --> 22:36.810
Ah, here he is now.

22:38.459 --> 22:41.656
Dawson, Toby.

22:41.699 --> 22:45.977
Charmed, I'm sure.

22:46.019 --> 22:47.974
Now, Toby... Toby, stop that!

22:48.018 --> 22:50.453
Toby, cease! Desist!

22:52.418 --> 22:53.771
Frightfully sorry, old man.

22:53.818 --> 22:55.888
Toby has the most
splendid sense of smell...

22:55.938 --> 23:00.328
of any hound I've trained,
but he can be deucedly frisky.

23:09.936 --> 23:13.167
Silly doggy.

23:13.216 --> 23:14.774
Would you like a crumpet?

23:21.694 --> 23:24.492
Now, Toby, Toby,
to the matter at hand.

23:24.534 --> 23:26.331
I want you to...

23:34.293 --> 23:36.647
Good. Now, Toby...

23:36.692 --> 23:42.006
Toby, I want you to find...
this fiend.

23:42.053 --> 23:43.930
Yes, you know his type.

23:43.973 --> 23:47.600
A villain! A scoundrel!

23:47.651 --> 23:51.041
Low brow. Close-set eyes.
Broken wing.

23:51.091 --> 23:53.764
Oh. He's a peg-leg bat
with a broken wing.

23:56.770 --> 23:59.648
That's the spirit!
Got his scent?

23:59.690 --> 24:01.521
Good boy! Good boy!

24:04.569 --> 24:05.968
Miss Flamchester...

24:06.009 --> 24:07.284
- Flaversham!
- Flaversham!

24:07.329 --> 24:10.207
Whatever. Your father
is as good as found.

24:12.488 --> 24:14.161
Sic 'em!

24:17.448 --> 24:19.439
Tally-ho!

24:30.686 --> 24:33.281
The thrill of the hunt,
eh, Dawson?

24:33.327 --> 24:35.965
Uh, quite!

24:36.005 --> 24:39.918
Ho ho ho! Our peg-legged quarry
can't be far now!

25:01.082 --> 25:04.677
"Get the following."
Tools, check. I got the tools.

25:04.722 --> 25:07.474
Gears, double check.
I got gears.

25:07.521 --> 25:09.591
Girl? No, didn't get girl.

25:09.642 --> 25:13.316
Uniforms?
I got plenty of uniforms.

25:13.360 --> 25:17.718
Oh, no, no! I gotta hide!
I gotta hide! I gotta hide!

25:24.720 --> 25:26.915
Splendid job, Toby!

25:46.077 --> 25:48.954
Now, Toby, sit!

25:52.677 --> 25:56.352
- Toby... sit.
- Sit, Toby.

25:59.076 --> 26:01.828
Good boy. If you'll excuse me.

26:03.555 --> 26:05.227
You be good now.

26:05.275 --> 26:07.835
We're going to find my father.

26:16.553 --> 26:19.511
Here is our friend's entrance.

26:19.553 --> 26:23.431
But, Basil, how could he fit
in through such a tiny...

26:23.472 --> 26:25.270
Observe, Doctor.

26:29.471 --> 26:32.623
Basil, you astound me!

26:49.789 --> 26:52.462
I beg your pardon. I...

26:54.748 --> 26:57.138
Oh, my.

26:59.548 --> 27:01.698
Upon my word...

27:01.748 --> 27:03.739
I've never seen so many toys.

27:03.788 --> 27:07.062
Behind any of which could lurk
our bloodthirsty assassin!

27:07.106 --> 27:10.702
So, please, Doctor,
be very careful.

27:43.982 --> 27:47.179
Oh! What the de... Ohh!

27:50.102 --> 27:54.094
Please! Quiet.

27:54.141 --> 27:57.850
Don't let this girl
out of your sight.

28:01.741 --> 28:04.379
Now, Olivia, dear, stay close.

28:14.059 --> 28:15.731
Checkmate.

28:18.538 --> 28:22.577
Evidence of
our peg-legged adversary!

28:31.337 --> 28:33.248
How very odd.

28:33.297 --> 28:34.935
What is it, Basil?

28:34.976 --> 28:37.615
Isn't it painfully obvious,
Doctor?

28:37.655 --> 28:41.444
These dolls have been stripped
of their uniforms.

28:41.496 --> 28:45.125
And not by any child, either.

28:54.813 --> 28:57.806
Someone has taken
the liberty of removing...

28:57.854 --> 29:02.051
the clockwork mechanisms
from these toys.

29:11.451 --> 29:13.043
Please,
I'm trying to concentrate.

29:13.091 --> 29:14.683
But, Basil, I...

29:58.567 --> 30:00.079
Got you!

30:00.126 --> 30:01.526
Quickly, Doctor!

30:03.326 --> 30:05.361
Look out!

30:49.640 --> 30:53.076
Stop, you fiend!

31:20.357 --> 31:23.428
Help! Mr Basil! Help! Help!

31:23.476 --> 31:25.228
# I got the gears,
I got the tools #

31:25.276 --> 31:26.993
# I got the uniforms #

31:27.036 --> 31:28.832
# I got the girl #

31:36.634 --> 31:38.147
Mama.

31:44.674 --> 31:47.141
Basil! Olivia! Olivia, she...

31:47.193 --> 31:50.264
Yes, she's gone, Dawson!

31:50.312 --> 31:55.989
Confound it! I told you
to watch over the girl!

31:56.031 --> 31:59.820
Now she's been spirited away
by that maniacal little monster!

31:59.871 --> 32:02.590
Soon to be in the clutches
of the most depraved mind...

32:02.632 --> 32:06.067
in all of London! I should have
known better than to...

32:06.111 --> 32:08.066
than to...

32:08.110 --> 32:10.226
Um, I...

32:16.189 --> 32:19.704
I say, Dawson, old chap...

32:19.749 --> 32:23.298
Ohh, that poor girl.

32:23.350 --> 32:26.738
I should have watched her
more closely.

32:28.067 --> 32:30.582
Don't worry, old fellow.

32:30.628 --> 32:33.745
It's not entirely hopeless.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.896
We'll get her back.

32:41.707 --> 32:44.379
Do... do you think
there's a chance?

32:44.426 --> 32:51.821
There's always a chance, Doctor,
as long as one can think.

33:06.663 --> 33:08.733
"Get the following...

33:08.783 --> 33:11.934
- "tools, gears..."
- What?

33:11.983 --> 33:14.781
- "Girl"?
- "Get the following."

33:14.822 --> 33:17.053
Dawson, you've done it!

33:17.103 --> 33:18.933
This list
is precisely what we need!

33:18.982 --> 33:20.210
What?

33:20.261 --> 33:22.138
Quickly! Back to Baker Street!

33:26.301 --> 33:29.293
Ahh, Mr Flaversham.

33:32.381 --> 33:34.940
Allow me to present...

33:34.980 --> 33:37.777
your charming daughter.

33:37.820 --> 33:39.970
- Olivia!
- Father!

33:40.020 --> 33:42.487
Ow! My foot! My only foot!

33:42.539 --> 33:46.577
Father!
I thought I'd never find you!

33:46.618 --> 33:50.008
Oh, there, there, there,
my bairn. I'm all right.

33:50.058 --> 33:53.334
Och, I was so worried
about my little girl.

33:53.378 --> 33:56.688
Oh, how sweet.

33:56.737 --> 34:01.333
Oh, I just love
tearful reunions.

34:01.377 --> 34:04.574
Now... come along, my dear.

34:04.617 --> 34:06.925
Oh, please! Please!

34:06.975 --> 34:08.887
- Father!
- Olivia!

34:08.936 --> 34:10.733
Oh, please, Professor!

34:10.775 --> 34:15.529
Now, now, Fidget
will take good care of her.

34:15.574 --> 34:20.523
That is, as long as
we have no further delays.

34:20.574 --> 34:23.043
Yes! Yes! I'll finish it!

34:23.094 --> 34:25.004
Oh, just don't hurt my daughter.

34:25.053 --> 34:31.161
Remember,
it must be ready tonight!

34:31.213 --> 34:33.522
Stop! Let me go!

34:33.572 --> 34:35.688
You ugly old thing!

34:35.732 --> 34:37.210
That'll hold you.

34:37.252 --> 34:39.925
Help! Let me out! Let me out!

34:39.972 --> 34:41.371
See how you like that!

34:43.891 --> 34:48.760
Ah, the uniforms! Oh, Fidget,
I knew I could rely on you.

34:48.811 --> 34:51.529
Now, you didn't forget anything?

34:51.571 --> 34:54.687
No problem.
I took care of everything.

34:54.731 --> 34:57.038
Everything on the list.
Uh-oh.

34:57.089 --> 34:58.967
What's wrong?

34:59.009 --> 35:02.001
- The list... but I know I...
- Where's the list?

35:02.049 --> 35:05.359
The list... yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, you see it was like this.

35:05.409 --> 35:07.365
I was in the toy store
getting uniforms...

35:07.409 --> 35:09.763
when I heard a "aroo aroo."

35:09.808 --> 35:13.164
You're not coming through.

35:13.208 --> 35:14.926
A doggy! I ran!

35:14.968 --> 35:18.403
I had baby bonnet, girl in bag,
and Basil ch-chased me!

35:18.448 --> 35:20.961
What? Basil on the case?

35:21.007 --> 35:23.646
Why, you gibbering little...

35:32.166 --> 35:34.281
Oh, my dear Fidget.

35:34.325 --> 35:37.158
You have been hanging
upside down too long.

35:37.205 --> 35:38.842
You mean you're not mad?

35:38.884 --> 35:42.514
I'm glad
you're taking it so well.

35:49.763 --> 35:54.757
Not me, you idiot!
No, stop, you stupid furball!

35:54.803 --> 35:56.202
Open up! Open up!

35:57.483 --> 35:58.881
You're hurting my wings!

35:58.922 --> 36:01.594
How dare that idiot Basil
poke his stupid nose...

36:01.641 --> 36:04.110
into my wonderful scheme
and foul up everything?

36:04.162 --> 36:06.516
Let me out! Let me out!

36:06.561 --> 36:08.917
Help!

36:08.961 --> 36:11.316
Oh, I can just see
that insufferable grin...

36:11.361 --> 36:13.556
on his smug face.

36:17.921 --> 36:21.707
Yes, I can just see it.

36:21.759 --> 36:24.990
Felicia, release him.

36:25.039 --> 36:26.950
I'm too young to die!

36:31.318 --> 36:34.390
Fidget,
you delightful little maniac.

36:34.438 --> 36:37.634
You've presented me
with a singular opportunity.

36:39.318 --> 36:46.108
Poor Basil. Oh, he is
in for a little surprise.

36:51.516 --> 36:54.348
Offhand,
I can deduce very little.

36:54.395 --> 36:56.386
Only that the words
are written...

36:56.435 --> 36:59.427
with a broad-pointed quill pen
which has spattered... twice...

36:59.475 --> 37:03.672
that the paper is of
native Mongolian manufacture...

37:03.715 --> 37:05.353
No watermark.

37:05.394 --> 37:10.023
And has... been gummed...
if I'm not very much in error...

37:10.074 --> 37:13.861
by a bat who has been drinking
Rodent's Delight...

37:13.913 --> 37:17.508
a cheap brand that is sold
only in the seediest pubs.

37:17.553 --> 37:18.986
Hmm, amazing.

37:19.033 --> 37:20.705
Oh, not really, Doctor.

37:20.752 --> 37:22.902
We still don't know
where it came from.

37:22.952 --> 37:25.705
Perhaps a closer inspection
will tell us something.

37:31.711 --> 37:33.508
Coal dust.

37:33.551 --> 37:38.227
Clearly of the type
used in sewer lamps.

37:45.630 --> 37:47.028
But, Basil, I...

37:47.069 --> 37:48.787
Shh. Don't speak.

37:54.828 --> 37:56.022
Excuse me, Dawson.

37:56.068 --> 37:58.627
Steady, hand...

38:03.667 --> 38:06.659
Yes. That's good.

38:06.707 --> 38:09.220
Come along, come along,
come along, come along.

38:09.266 --> 38:12.144
Yes, yes. Good, good.

38:12.186 --> 38:15.064
No, bad... good, good.
Oh, come along.

38:15.105 --> 38:18.256
Come on, come on.
Yes. Come on, come on.

38:23.545 --> 38:25.581
We've done it, old fellow!

38:25.625 --> 38:27.979
This reaction could only
have been triggered...

38:28.024 --> 38:29.662
by the paper's
extreme saturation...

38:29.704 --> 38:32.422
with distillation
of sodium chloride.

38:35.343 --> 38:38.540
Salt water? Great Scott.

38:38.582 --> 38:40.938
It proves beyond a doubt...

38:40.983 --> 38:45.134
this list
came from the riverfront area!

38:45.183 --> 38:47.218
Ah, now, steady on there, Basil.

38:47.262 --> 38:50.174
No, no.
Elementary, my dear Dawson.

38:50.222 --> 38:55.579
We merely look for a seedy pub
at the only spot...

38:55.620 --> 39:00.296
where the sewer
connects to the waterfront.

39:03.860 --> 39:06.657
Stay, Toby. Stay.

39:25.057 --> 39:26.854
Come, come, Dawson.

39:26.898 --> 39:29.456
I feel utterly ridiculous!

39:29.497 --> 39:32.533
Don't be absurd.
You look perfect.

39:32.576 --> 39:35.932
Perfect? Perfectly foolish.

40:02.692 --> 40:06.765
Stay close and do as I do.

40:27.850 --> 40:30.647
Oh, I do beg your pardon, madam.

40:30.689 --> 40:34.477
Quite unintentional...
I assure you.

40:37.729 --> 40:39.764
How impertinent!

40:39.808 --> 40:42.322
Remember, Dawson,
we're low-life ruffians.

40:42.368 --> 40:44.006
Well, I was until that...

41:01.925 --> 41:03.802
Get off, you eight-legged bum!

41:07.045 --> 41:08.558
What's your pleasure, mates?

41:08.605 --> 41:14.634
Well, I'll have a dry sherry
with, oh, perhaps a twist of...

41:14.684 --> 41:18.392
Two pints
for me and my shipmate.

41:18.444 --> 41:22.072
Oh, by the way,
we just got into port.

41:22.124 --> 41:24.717
We're looking
for an old friend of mine.

41:24.763 --> 41:30.233
Maybe you know him.
Goes by the name of Ratigan.

41:34.442 --> 41:37.592
I, uh... never heard of him.

41:59.918 --> 42:03.274
# Dearest friends,
dear gentlemen #

42:03.318 --> 42:06.468
# Listen to my song #

42:06.518 --> 42:09.987
# Life down here's
been hard for you #

42:10.038 --> 42:13.507
# Life has made you strong #

42:13.557 --> 42:18.630
# Let me lift the mood #

42:18.676 --> 42:24.990
# With my attitude #

42:25.036 --> 42:26.946
# Hey, fellas #

42:26.994 --> 42:29.065
# The time is right #

42:29.115 --> 42:30.946
# Get ready #

42:30.995 --> 42:33.109
# Tonight's the night #

42:33.153 --> 42:36.942
# Boys, what you're hoping for
will come true #

42:36.994 --> 42:41.509
# Let me be good to you #

42:41.553 --> 42:43.784
# You tough guys #

42:43.834 --> 42:48.145
# You're feeling all alone #

42:49.592 --> 42:51.344
# You rough guys #

42:51.392 --> 42:54.509
# The best of you sailors
and bums #

42:54.552 --> 42:57.065
# All of my chums #

42:57.111 --> 43:01.023
# So dream on
and drink your beer #

43:01.070 --> 43:03.539
# Get cozy #

43:03.591 --> 43:05.467
# Your baby's here #

43:05.510 --> 43:08.501
# You won't be misunderstood #

43:08.550 --> 43:12.907
# Let me be good to you #

43:14.350 --> 43:16.623
# Hey, fellas #

43:16.669 --> 43:21.742
# I'll take off all my blues #

43:21.788 --> 43:23.745
# Hey, fellas #

43:23.788 --> 43:26.825
# There's nothin' I won't do #

43:26.867 --> 43:30.143
# Just for you #

43:35.987 --> 43:37.545
There you are, boys.

43:37.587 --> 43:40.147
It's, uh, on the house.

43:40.186 --> 43:44.542
Oh. I say, how very generous.

43:47.626 --> 43:50.014
These drinks
have been... drugged!

43:51.784 --> 43:55.697
Has a rather nice bite to it.

43:55.744 --> 43:59.418
Jolly good, ladies. Jolly good!

43:59.463 --> 44:01.533
Dawson, get ahold of yourself!

44:01.584 --> 44:05.860
Ooh, bravo! Bravo!

44:13.462 --> 44:18.582
# So dream on
and drink your beer #

44:18.622 --> 44:21.932
If it isn't
our peg-legged friend.

44:21.981 --> 44:25.053
Dawson! Ho ho! What luck!

44:27.940 --> 44:31.296
# Your baby's
gonna come through #

44:31.340 --> 44:38.927
# Let me be good to you #

45:16.894 --> 45:19.089
Oh! What... what... what...

45:19.134 --> 45:21.409
What in heaven's name
is going on?

45:21.454 --> 45:23.808
I've spotted our peg-legged...

45:23.853 --> 45:27.128
Come on, old fellow,
there's not a moment to lose.

45:47.211 --> 45:49.645
# Let me be good to you #

45:55.050 --> 45:57.803
# So dream on
and drink your beer #

45:57.850 --> 45:59.841
# Your baby's here #

46:03.049 --> 46:04.641
Follow me.

46:09.848 --> 46:12.567
Great Scott.
I can't see a thing.

46:12.608 --> 46:16.122
Shh! Grab onto my coat
and follow along.

46:16.167 --> 46:21.240
No, no, no. Not that way!
Dawson, look out for your...

46:21.286 --> 46:24.596
Oh, confound it!

46:24.646 --> 46:27.399
Do you have any idea
where we're going?

46:27.446 --> 46:30.243
But of course. Left turn.

46:30.285 --> 46:32.641
Right turn here, Doctor.

46:37.364 --> 46:39.560
Aha! Dawson, we've found it!

46:39.604 --> 46:41.799
Ratigan's secret lair!

46:41.844 --> 46:45.119
And it's filthier
than I imagined.

46:50.803 --> 46:52.316
Oh, Dawson, the bottle!

47:01.722 --> 47:03.598
It's stuck!

47:07.041 --> 47:08.474
Surprise!

47:12.640 --> 47:15.518
Bravo! Bravo!

47:15.560 --> 47:17.675
A marvellous performance!

47:21.480 --> 47:26.677
Though, frankly, I expected you
fifteen minutes earlier.

47:26.718 --> 47:28.993
Trouble with the chemistry set,
old boy?

47:31.438 --> 47:33.429
Ratigan, no one can have...

47:33.478 --> 47:35.752
a higher opinion of you
than I have...

47:35.797 --> 47:39.506
and I think you're a slimy,
contemptible sewer rat!

47:43.236 --> 47:48.310
Oh, by the way, Basil,
I just love your disguise.

47:49.915 --> 47:54.864
Really, one would
hardly recognize you.

47:54.915 --> 47:58.191
The greatest... detective...

47:58.234 --> 48:00.794
in all mousedom!

48:00.834 --> 48:06.908
Ratigan, so help me,
I'll see you behind bars yet!

48:06.953 --> 48:12.152
You fool! Isn't it clear to you
the superior mind has triumphed?

48:12.193 --> 48:13.751
I've won!

48:31.350 --> 48:33.068
Oh, I love it! I love it!

48:34.910 --> 48:36.787
Oh, I love it! I love it!
I love it!

48:38.709 --> 48:42.498
You don't know what
a delightful dilemma it was...

48:42.549 --> 48:46.860
trying to decide on
the most appropriate method...

48:46.908 --> 48:48.262
for your demise.

48:48.309 --> 48:51.220
Oh, I had
so many ingenious ideas...

48:51.268 --> 48:54.260
I didn't know which to choose.

48:54.308 --> 49:00.576
So I decided to use them all.

49:00.627 --> 49:02.982
Marvellous, isn't it?

49:03.027 --> 49:07.860
Ha ha! Here...
let me show you how it works.

49:07.905 --> 49:09.055
Picture this...

49:09.106 --> 49:11.096
first, a sprightly tune...

49:11.145 --> 49:14.103
I've recorded
especially for you.

49:14.145 --> 49:17.854
As the song plays,
the cord tightens...

49:17.905 --> 49:22.739
and when the song ends,
the metal ball is released...

49:22.784 --> 49:26.572
rolling along
its merry way until...

49:35.023 --> 49:38.981
And so ends the short,
undistinguished career...

49:39.022 --> 49:41.092
of Basil of Baker Street.

49:41.142 --> 49:43.336
You're... despicable.

49:45.622 --> 49:47.613
- Everything's ready, Fidget?
- All set, boss.

49:51.501 --> 49:54.014
Oh, this is wicked.

49:54.060 --> 49:57.177
So delightfully wicked!

49:57.220 --> 50:01.007
Mr Flaversham,
let me congratulate you...

50:01.060 --> 50:04.257
on a superb piece
of craftsmanship.

50:04.300 --> 50:07.610
See what you can do
with the proper motivation?

50:11.018 --> 50:12.736
You all know the plan.

50:12.778 --> 50:14.530
Right, Professor!

50:17.098 --> 50:21.613
It was my fond hope to stay
and witness your final scene...

50:21.657 --> 50:24.490
but you were
fifteen minutes late...

50:24.537 --> 50:27.926
and I do have an important
engagement at, uh...

50:27.976 --> 50:29.534
Buckingham Palace.

50:31.176 --> 50:35.930
Now, you will remember to smile
for the camera, won't you?

50:35.975 --> 50:38.967
Say cheese.

50:40.615 --> 50:42.173
You fiend!

50:42.215 --> 50:43.648
Sorry, chubby.

50:43.695 --> 50:45.844
You should have chosen
your friends more carefully.

50:52.653 --> 50:56.248
# Goodbye so soon #

50:56.293 --> 50:59.365
# And isn't this a crime? #

50:59.413 --> 51:01.482
# We know by now... #

51:01.532 --> 51:05.571
Adieu! Auf wiedersehen!
Arrivederci!

51:05.611 --> 51:07.489
Farewell!

51:09.451 --> 51:11.169
Bye-bye, Basil.

51:11.211 --> 51:12.963
#... your separate way #

51:13.011 --> 51:16.161
# With time so short,
I'll say so long #

51:16.210 --> 51:21.728
# And go, so soon, goodbye #

51:23.449 --> 51:26.407
# You followed me,
I followed you #

51:26.449 --> 51:29.885
# We were like each other's
shadows for a while #

51:29.929 --> 51:33.001
# Now as you see,
this game is through #

51:33.049 --> 51:34.447
# So, although it hurts... #

51:34.488 --> 51:37.560
What did he mean, an engagement
at Buckingham Palace?

51:37.608 --> 51:42.238
Ohh, haven't you
figured it out yet, Doctor?

51:42.287 --> 51:45.563
The Queen's in danger,
and the Empire's doomed.

51:45.607 --> 51:46.880
The Queen?

52:07.165 --> 52:09.758
Psst. Over here.
Come on. Over here.

52:15.923 --> 52:17.720
Come in!

52:17.764 --> 52:19.798
Uh, begging
Your Majesty's pardon.

52:19.842 --> 52:22.562
A present has just arrived
in honour of your Jubilee.

52:22.603 --> 52:26.834
A present? Oh, how wonderful!

52:26.882 --> 52:30.954
Ahh, I just adore Jubilees.

52:31.001 --> 52:34.073
Here you are, sweetheart.

52:34.121 --> 52:38.352
Have you been with us long?

52:39.840 --> 52:42.990
"To our beloved Queen...

52:43.040 --> 52:45.394
"this gift we send...

52:45.440 --> 52:48.716
"as her sixty-year reign...

52:48.760 --> 52:51.353
"comes to an end"?

52:58.398 --> 53:01.151
How extraordinary.

53:06.597 --> 53:08.588
Goodness gracious!

53:15.476 --> 53:19.070
Amazing likeness, isn't it,
Your Majesty?

53:19.116 --> 53:21.389
Professor Ratigan!

53:21.435 --> 53:25.793
Guards, seize
this despicable creature!

53:34.233 --> 53:37.066
Oh, how dare you!

53:37.113 --> 53:39.024
Take her away.

53:39.073 --> 53:43.385
Let go of me, you ruffians!

53:43.433 --> 53:46.789
- Move along, honey.
- You fiends!

53:46.833 --> 53:49.426
Traitors!

53:49.472 --> 53:52.065
# It's through,
so although it hurts #

53:52.111 --> 53:57.822
# I'll try to smile
as I say goodbye #

53:57.871 --> 53:59.781
# So soon #

53:59.830 --> 54:05.029
# And isn't this a crime? #

54:05.070 --> 54:08.221
Oh, how could I have been
so blind?

54:08.270 --> 54:10.737
We all make mistakes...

54:10.788 --> 54:12.825
but we can't let that stop us.
We have to...

54:12.869 --> 54:16.225
Ratigan's proved
he's more clever than I.

54:16.269 --> 54:18.657
He would never have walked
into such an obvious trap.

54:18.709 --> 54:23.577
Oh, pull yourself together!
You can stop that villain! Why...

54:23.628 --> 54:26.859
Basil! The record!

54:26.908 --> 54:31.025
Oh, it's finally happened.
I've been outwitted.

54:31.067 --> 54:35.617
- Basil, please!
- Beaten, duped, made a fool of!

54:35.666 --> 54:37.816
- Ridiculed, belittled...
- That's enough!

54:37.866 --> 54:40.141
# As you see... #

54:40.185 --> 54:42.823
Dash it all, Basil!
The Queen's in danger!

54:42.865 --> 54:44.423
Olivia's counting on us!

54:44.464 --> 54:46.183
We're about to be
horribly splatted...

54:46.224 --> 54:48.863
and all you can do is lie there
feeling sorry for yourself.

54:48.904 --> 54:52.055
Well, I know you can save us,
but if you've given up...

54:52.103 --> 54:54.777
why don't we just set it off
now and be done with it?

54:54.824 --> 54:58.577
# We know by now
that time knows how to fly #

54:58.623 --> 55:01.012
"Set it off now."

55:10.222 --> 55:12.895
We'll set the trap off now!

55:12.942 --> 55:15.899
Basil, wait! I didn't mean
that we ought to...

55:20.581 --> 55:21.980
Angle of the trajectory
multiplied...

55:22.021 --> 55:24.454
by the square root
of an isosceles triangle...

55:26.220 --> 55:28.779
dividing Guttermeg's principle
of opposing forces in motion...

55:31.899 --> 55:33.776
and adjusting for the difference
in equilibrium...

55:35.779 --> 55:37.735
Dawson, at the exact moment
I tell you...

55:37.779 --> 55:40.087
we must release
the triggering mechanism.

55:40.139 --> 55:42.811
Get ready, Dawson.

55:42.858 --> 55:44.176
Steady...

55:45.338 --> 55:46.930
Now!

56:02.695 --> 56:04.686
Thank you, Dawson.

56:04.735 --> 56:05.929
Smile, everyone!

56:24.972 --> 56:29.523
On this most august occasion,
we are gathered here...

56:29.572 --> 56:33.770
not only to commemorate
my sixty years as queen...

56:33.811 --> 56:35.962
but to honour one...

56:36.011 --> 56:38.845
...Of truly noble stature.

56:38.892 --> 56:42.088
I present to you
a statesman among mice...

56:42.131 --> 56:43.961
a gifted leader...

56:44.010 --> 56:46.525
a crusader for justice...

56:46.571 --> 56:50.324
Over here, honey.
Your turn, toots.

56:50.370 --> 56:52.929
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Time for mouse chow.

56:54.650 --> 56:58.766
A majestic
mountain of humility...

56:58.809 --> 57:02.437
and my new royal consort...

57:02.488 --> 57:07.003
Professor Ratigan!

57:23.965 --> 57:27.162
The game's afoot, Toby!
Our Queen is in mortal danger!

57:31.485 --> 57:33.759
To Buckingham Palace!

57:34.924 --> 57:36.755
Thank you, Your Majesty.

57:36.804 --> 57:40.001
And now,
as your new royal consort...

57:40.044 --> 57:43.876
I have a few slight suggestions.

57:45.843 --> 57:47.595
Item one...

57:51.282 --> 57:52.476
Stop it!

58:10.440 --> 58:12.158
Open wide!

58:17.599 --> 58:20.067
Down, down, kitty! Down!

58:24.758 --> 58:26.237
Item 96.

58:28.958 --> 58:30.789
A heavy tax shall be levied...

58:30.837 --> 58:34.545
against all parasites
and spongers...

58:34.596 --> 58:38.066
such as the elderly,
the infirm...

58:38.117 --> 58:42.314
and especially little children.

58:42.356 --> 58:46.065
That's ridiculous!
You're insane!

58:46.116 --> 58:49.312
Perhaps
I haven't made myself clear.

58:49.355 --> 58:51.823
I have the power!

58:51.875 --> 58:53.273
Of course you do.

58:53.314 --> 58:56.112
- I am supreme!
- Only you.

58:56.154 --> 58:58.224
This is my kingdom!

59:04.033 --> 59:07.582
That is, of course,
with Your Highness's permission.

59:09.993 --> 59:12.826
Most assuredly...

59:12.873 --> 59:15.670
you insidious fiend.

59:15.713 --> 59:18.431
- What?
- You're not my royal consort...

59:18.472 --> 59:20.029
What a sense of humour.

59:20.072 --> 59:21.629
You're a cheap fraud...
an imposter!

59:21.671 --> 59:22.990
Flaversham!

59:23.031 --> 59:26.580
A corrupt, vicious demented,
low-life scoundrel.

59:26.631 --> 59:29.588
There's no evil scheme
you wouldn't concoct.

59:36.229 --> 59:39.346
No depravity
you wouldn't commit!

59:41.269 --> 59:45.466
You, Professor, are none other
than a foul stenchus rodentus...

59:45.508 --> 59:46.987
commonly known as a...

59:47.028 --> 59:49.496
- Don't say it!
- Sewer rat!

59:50.908 --> 59:53.102
Arrest that fiend!

01:00:28.863 --> 01:00:30.342
The girl! The girl!

01:00:34.143 --> 01:00:39.341
Stay where you are,
or the girl dies!

01:00:39.381 --> 01:00:41.691
Hurry, Dawson!

01:00:44.301 --> 01:00:45.814
There he goes!

01:00:50.381 --> 01:00:54.497
Dawson! Flaversham!
Gather up those balloons!

01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:06.330
Just wait!
Basil's smarter than you!

01:01:06.379 --> 01:01:08.414
He's going to put you in jail.

01:01:08.458 --> 01:01:13.657
He's not afraid
of a big old ugly rat like you!

01:01:13.698 --> 01:01:17.292
Would you kindly sit down
and shut up?!

01:01:29.096 --> 01:01:30.653
Let her go, chaps!

01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:08.926
We have to lighten the load.

01:02:08.971 --> 01:02:12.929
Oh, you want
to lighten the load.

01:02:12.970 --> 01:02:15.165
Excellent idea.

01:02:15.210 --> 01:02:18.361
No! Not me! Wait, I can't fly!
I can't fly!

01:02:25.889 --> 01:02:27.526
Steady!

01:03:16.922 --> 01:03:19.197
Basil, look out!

01:04:15.076 --> 01:04:17.589
Closer, Dawson!

01:04:17.635 --> 01:04:19.034
Closer!

01:04:20.555 --> 01:04:24.672
Daddy, I can't reach!
I can't reach!

01:04:43.511 --> 01:04:46.504
Basil! Over here!

01:04:51.871 --> 01:04:55.227
There's no escape this time,
Basil!

01:05:30.106 --> 01:05:31.539
I've won!

01:05:33.587 --> 01:05:35.815
On the contrary!

01:05:37.425 --> 01:05:39.416
The game's not over yet!

01:06:22.140 --> 01:06:24.973
- Hooray!
- Good fellow! Oh, jolly good!

01:06:36.858 --> 01:06:40.328
To be thanked
by the Queen herself...

01:06:40.377 --> 01:06:44.450
Oh, how very thrilling,
eh, Basil?

01:06:44.497 --> 01:06:47.409
All in a day's work, Doctor.

01:06:47.457 --> 01:06:50.096
Oh, Dr Dawson,
you were wonderful.

01:06:52.376 --> 01:06:57.085
Indeed. Och, my,
we're late to catch our train.

01:06:57.135 --> 01:06:58.329
Come along, Olivia.

01:06:58.375 --> 01:06:59.808
Yes, Father.

01:06:59.855 --> 01:07:04.531
Goodbye, Basil.
I... I'll never forget you.

01:07:04.575 --> 01:07:08.727
Nor I you,
Miss... Miss Flangerhanger.

01:07:13.334 --> 01:07:14.847
Whatever.

01:07:14.894 --> 01:07:19.011
- Goodbye, Dr Dawson.
- Goodbye, my dear.

01:07:25.813 --> 01:07:30.646
Well, um, ahem.
Not a bad little girl, actually.

01:07:30.691 --> 01:07:32.204
Not at all.

01:07:34.291 --> 01:07:39.445
Well, it's time
I was on my way, too.

01:07:39.491 --> 01:07:42.846
But, um, but I thought...

01:07:42.890 --> 01:07:45.199
Well, the case is over...

01:07:45.250 --> 01:07:49.288
and perhaps it's...
well, perhaps it's best...

01:07:49.329 --> 01:07:51.685
I found my own living quarters.

01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:54.402
But...
Oh, now, who can that be?

01:07:56.728 --> 01:08:01.358
I-Is this the home of the famous
Basil of Baker Street?

01:08:01.408 --> 01:08:03.638
Indeed it is, miss.

01:08:03.687 --> 01:08:06.440
You look as if
you're in some trouble.

01:08:06.487 --> 01:08:11.116
Oh, I am. I am!

01:08:11.166 --> 01:08:13.964
Then you've come
to precisely the right place.

01:08:14.006 --> 01:08:18.237
Ah, allow me to introduce my
trusted associate, Dr Dawson...

01:08:18.285 --> 01:08:22.836
with whom I do all my cases.
Isn't that right, Doctor?

01:08:22.885 --> 01:08:24.205
What? What?

01:08:24.245 --> 01:08:28.682
Oh, yes. Yes, by all means.

01:08:31.243 --> 01:08:33.314
As you can see, Dawson,
this young lady...

01:08:33.363 --> 01:08:35.399
has just arrived
from the Hampstead District...

01:08:35.443 --> 01:08:37.434
and is troubled about
the mysterious disappearance...

01:08:37.483 --> 01:08:40.042
of an emerald ring
missing from the third finger...

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:43.040
of her right hand.
Now, tell me the story...

01:08:43.082 --> 01:08:45.515
and, pray,
be as precise as possible.

01:08:45.562 --> 01:08:47.041
From that time on...

01:08:47.082 --> 01:08:49.960
Basil and I
were a close team...

01:08:50.002 --> 01:08:53.960
and over the years,
we had many cases together...

01:08:54.001 --> 01:08:57.881
but I shall always
look back on that first...

01:08:57.921 --> 01:09:00.037
with the most fondness...

01:09:00.081 --> 01:09:04.948
my introduction
to Basil of Baker Street...

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.560
The Great Mouse Detective!
