WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.926
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:13.179 --> 00:15.056
<i>I think they were already friends.</i>

00:15.140 --> 00:17.475
<i>Yeah, he and Mariah were friends.</i>

00:18.184 --> 00:19.269
And I remember,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.355
that before traveling to Seoul,

00:22.439 --> 00:23.857
we had a fight.

00:24.607 --> 00:27.360
So, I almost didn't meet Michael Jackson.

00:27.444 --> 00:28.778
Imagine that.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.699
Those are the stories
that have to be in my series.

00:32.782 --> 00:35.243
Imagine, me in Korea

00:35.827 --> 00:37.328
with Michael Jackson.

00:37.412 --> 00:38.788
That's gold.

00:38.872 --> 00:42.125
It is, yeah,
but let's not get carried away.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.879
First, we need to see
how production wants to tell the story.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.338
What? What do you mean?

00:49.007 --> 00:50.091
It's my story, right?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.386
It will be about whatever I want.

00:53.470 --> 00:54.304
That's it.

01:02.103 --> 01:03.855
Nice offices.

01:05.398 --> 01:07.233
Yeah, they do things right.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.658
It's a nice group. You'll like them.

01:27.378 --> 01:28.338
Good evening!

01:28.421 --> 01:29.798
- Hi, Miguel.
- Hello, Miguel.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.216
How are you?

01:31.966 --> 01:33.009
Micky.

01:33.593 --> 01:35.303
- This is Carla, my partner.
- Carla.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.013
Hi, Carla. How are you?

01:37.097 --> 01:38.306
Good. Welcome.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.682
Nice shoes.

01:39.766 --> 01:40.683
Thanks.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.060
Pablo Cruz.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.938
- Hi, how are you, Pablo?
- A pleasure.

01:45.021 --> 01:46.231
The pleasure's mine.

01:46.314 --> 01:47.982
These are our producers.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.276
- Right, producers, great.
- Yes.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.740
I speak a little Spanish.

01:55.824 --> 01:57.116
Oh, nice.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.152
Well, first and foremost,

02:32.235 --> 02:33.611
thanks for being here.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.280
Like I told Miguel,

02:35.363 --> 02:38.241
these talks are very important
to get the project started.

02:38.324 --> 02:41.202
So, we are truly thankful you're here.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.162
My pleasure.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.455
So,

02:45.623 --> 02:47.125
where do you want me to start?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.502
I can tell you

02:50.420 --> 02:52.547
about when I sang
at Sanremo when I was 15.

02:53.506 --> 02:55.884
No other singer
had been on that stage so young.

02:59.053 --> 03:04.100
Well, I think we should go
through your life chronologically.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.312
Hey, I've been at this
for almost four decades.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.397
We'd be here all day.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.859
So, where do you want me to start?

03:20.366 --> 03:23.494
We'd like to kick off the project

03:23.578 --> 03:25.705
right at the beginning of your career.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.415
Tell us

03:27.916 --> 03:29.959
about your experiences with your dad.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.044
With my father?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.213
Yes, that's the idea.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.763
We read that your father was, let's say,

03:42.347 --> 03:43.348
demanding.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.520
He was disciplined,

03:50.063 --> 03:51.064
not demanding.

03:52.982 --> 03:55.026
Where did you read about my father?

03:55.109 --> 03:56.861
We did our homework.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.447
Look what we found.

04:20.677 --> 04:22.679
Please, turn that off.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.055
Sorry.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.391
- Turn it off.
- Okay.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.073
Let's go, babe.

06:11.537 --> 06:12.789
Careful!

06:17.543 --> 06:19.170
Cata didn't want to let me come.

06:19.253 --> 06:22.256
She'll never stop bossing you around.
You're a woman now.

06:22.340 --> 06:26.344
Luis, they'd die if they knew
I was with you without being married.

06:26.427 --> 06:28.262
Yeah, I know.

06:28.346 --> 06:29.222
They're no fools.

06:37.688 --> 06:41.359
I hope it's better
than the cabaret where I met you.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.444
Don't start nagging.

06:43.528 --> 06:44.987
I'll send you back to Cata.

06:47.115 --> 06:49.617
Antoñito! What a coincidence!
I can't believe it!

06:49.700 --> 06:50.743
Who is he?

06:50.827 --> 06:53.955
An amazing photographer,
photographer to the stars.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.373
- Hi.
- Nice to see you.

06:55.456 --> 06:56.624
You too, man.

06:56.707 --> 06:57.708
- Good.
- Great.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.252
You caught us, huh?

06:59.335 --> 07:01.796
- With the camera.
- You want a picture, I guess.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.257
- Are you taking pictures?
- I mean, yeah.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.676
Of course,
you're Luisito Rey's girlfriend.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.136
- Yeah.
- An exclusive?

07:08.219 --> 07:09.429
But of course.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.431
Look, how about right there?

07:11.514 --> 07:12.890
- With the church.
- Lovely.

07:12.974 --> 07:15.518
All right, let's take it here.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.688
Come here. Isn't it nice?

07:18.771 --> 07:20.648
Take your glasses off, babe.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.526
You'll want them to know
you're beautiful, okay?

07:23.609 --> 07:24.694
- All right.
- Okay.

07:24.777 --> 07:25.778
Like this, kissing.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.323
That's it. Here we go.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.083
<i>I'm with you, Marcela</i>

09:02.959 --> 09:04.585
<i>Everything seems to me</i>

09:06.545 --> 09:09.674
<i>Everything seems
More beautiful to me with you</i>

09:09.757 --> 09:11.342
<i>Marcela</i>

09:11.425 --> 09:12.301
There, ready.

09:13.469 --> 09:14.303
Coming!

09:21.227 --> 09:22.687
Hold on, dammit!

09:22.770 --> 09:24.063
For fuck's sake!

09:26.148 --> 09:27.191
What is it?

09:30.152 --> 09:31.279
What's wrong with you?

09:33.489 --> 09:34.323
Come in.

09:36.033 --> 09:36.993
Awesome!

09:39.745 --> 09:40.955
You told me

09:41.038 --> 09:43.583
you had to marry me
in order to leave your house.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.875
Well, there you have it.

09:45.376 --> 09:46.460
Luis,

09:46.544 --> 09:48.838
they took pictures of us outside a church.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.882
That isn't getting married!

09:53.092 --> 09:53.968
Well--

09:54.760 --> 09:56.345
My dad's going to kill me.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.098
We both look great.

10:01.058 --> 10:03.394
Your dad isn't gonna kill you,
don't be silly.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.479
By the way, Alfred called.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.232
He said the album is a hit.

10:08.316 --> 10:10.610
He wants me to tour in Puerto Rico

10:10.693 --> 10:12.361
all this year and next year.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.196
What? Now you're leaving?

10:14.989 --> 10:16.574
You're coming with me.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.783
Of course, this week.

10:19.201 --> 10:20.286
You're crazy.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.621
What?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.998
Your dad won't let you?
We're married, girl.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.710
Not like this, Luis. Not like this.

10:28.627 --> 10:30.129
Listen, babe.

10:31.047 --> 10:32.340
Marcela, my love.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.716
What's wrong? What is it?

10:34.925 --> 10:38.054
Do you want to marry a friend?

10:38.137 --> 10:39.722
Someone your daddy likes?

10:40.222 --> 10:42.933
Some average Joe or something?
That's what will happen.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.603
And live some average life?

10:46.228 --> 10:48.689
Or will you come with me to Puerto Rico?

10:48.773 --> 10:51.275
We'll go to Puerto Rico,
then somewhere else.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.445
And then skip from one place
to another and travel the world!

10:55.404 --> 10:57.281
A boring life would never be better

10:57.365 --> 10:58.991
than a lifetime with me, love.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.619
Do you promise we'll get married?

11:02.495 --> 11:04.163
You have Luis Gallego Rey's word.

11:19.887 --> 11:23.307
And then, they went to Puerto Rico.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.896
They must've been so in love.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.147
I guess.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.462
I think that's enough for today.

11:54.046 --> 11:54.880
I'm tired.

11:55.464 --> 11:56.507
Of course, right.

11:57.341 --> 11:58.426
- Yeah.
- Well.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.892
That wasn't a meeting, Miguel.

12:08.144 --> 12:09.437
It was an investigation.

12:14.233 --> 12:16.026
You knew they'd ask all that.

12:16.110 --> 12:19.280
They want to know
about your childhood, of course.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.534
It would've been good to know
before signing away the rights.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.911
I know this must be strange for you,

12:26.412 --> 12:29.165
but we're talking about your life story.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.624
Exactly! My life!

12:30.708 --> 12:33.711
Why the hell do they care
if my parents got married or not?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.171
You're here for them.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.217
They want to tell the whole story.

12:40.301 --> 12:43.554
I don't know, find some anecdote you like.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.597
Tell them about it.

12:46.682 --> 12:48.851
A nice anecdote about my dad?

12:50.269 --> 12:51.520
There must be something.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.513
<i>Yes, her water broke.
She'll give birth any moment.</i>

14:49.597 --> 14:50.931
Yeah, I got it,

14:51.015 --> 14:53.601
but can't she wait a while?

14:53.684 --> 14:56.896
Maybe, if she squeezes her legs together,
the baby won't pop out.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.690
<i>That's not how deliveries work.</i>

14:59.773 --> 15:02.401
I'm on the other side of the island.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.361
I'm giving a concert in ten minutes.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.571
- Let's go, Luis!
- Yeah.

15:05.654 --> 15:08.949
<i>A concert is more important
than to see the birth of your child?</i>

15:09.033 --> 15:10.200
Okay!

15:10.284 --> 15:11.452
Got it! Hang up!

15:11.535 --> 15:13.245
We're late. We have a show!

15:13.829 --> 15:14.788
Let's go!

15:21.503 --> 15:22.338
Got to go!

15:22.421 --> 15:24.423
AMERICA THEATER

15:33.766 --> 15:35.351
Hi, handsome.

15:41.690 --> 15:42.733
How are you?

15:43.359 --> 15:44.777
- Is this one mine?
- Yes.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.655
- You're giving him to me?
- Yes.

15:49.114 --> 15:49.949
Like this?

15:52.368 --> 15:53.494
Congratulations.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.412
Thanks.

16:03.212 --> 16:04.630
Hi, there.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.007
Welcome.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.806
- Excuse me, ma'am, Luis Rey's room?
- Here!

16:13.889 --> 16:15.224
- Come!
- Thanks.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.183
Luis!

16:17.142 --> 16:20.020
- He's taking a picture for the paper.
- You didn't warn me.

16:20.104 --> 16:22.439
- I've said it 20 times, you forgot.
- Marcela!

16:22.523 --> 16:25.192
- Congratulations!
- Hi, Toño, how are you?

16:25.275 --> 16:26.652
- Great.
- Look.

16:26.735 --> 16:29.780
- He's beautiful! Have you named him?
- Yes, Luis Miguel.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.240
That's right.

16:31.323 --> 16:32.908
Nice, after his dad!

16:32.992 --> 16:34.868
No, after the bullfighter, Dominguín.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.829
You're clueless, kid. Take a picture.

16:36.912 --> 16:38.831
- Careful.
- I'll take a picture, then.

16:38.914 --> 16:41.375
- Okay, here.
- Beautiful.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.044
- Man, I'm hot! He's heavy.
- So pretty.

16:44.128 --> 16:47.006
- Congratulations.
- Okay, take it.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.465
- Ready?
- Do it.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.384
- Beautiful.
- One more, kid.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.635
- One more?
- Yes.

16:51.719 --> 16:52.803
All right.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.054
And--

16:54.138 --> 16:56.682
- Beautiful.
- Great.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.268
- We're done.
- Let's go outside.

16:59.351 --> 17:01.812
- Congratulations, Marce.
- Thanks, see you!

17:02.479 --> 17:03.522
Congratulations.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.482
- Lovely child, huh?
- Beautiful.

17:05.566 --> 17:07.151
Such a blessing.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.944
- How much do I owe you?
- A hundred.

17:09.611 --> 17:12.614
- You're charging me $100, asshole?
- That's what we agreed.

17:12.698 --> 17:16.034
- I should become a papirazzi or paparazzi.
- Paparazzi.

17:16.118 --> 17:17.953
- A damn first page.
- First page.

17:18.037 --> 17:19.204
- Cover picture.
- Yeah.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.456
- Don't let me down.
- No.

17:21.832 --> 17:22.875
Damn, Luis.

17:22.958 --> 17:25.085
The money wasn't where you said.

17:25.169 --> 17:27.963
Of course it was,
in the bedroom, in the drawer.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.049
It wasn't anywhere, I swear.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.843
Then, I've been robbed. I've been robbed!

17:32.926 --> 17:33.927
Robbed?

17:34.011 --> 17:36.722
I'll have to run out of here
with my wife and baby.

17:36.805 --> 17:40.142
- You've no cash to pay the bill?
- That was all I had.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.311
Someone must've taken it, I don't know.

17:42.394 --> 17:45.189
- I'll lend it to you, don't worry.
- Great! Please do.

17:45.272 --> 17:48.275
- We'll settle it with the tour.
- And hunt that fucker down.

17:50.319 --> 17:52.529
<i>This happened in San Juan, Puerto Rico.</i>

17:53.113 --> 17:55.532
I wasn't born in Mexico,
in case you didn't know.

17:58.786 --> 18:01.330
We read something about that day.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.207
- Uh-huh.
- We'd like to--

18:03.290 --> 18:05.959
It seems your dad never paid his manager.

18:07.044 --> 18:09.338
He said Alfred owed him $5,000 dollars

18:09.421 --> 18:11.548
and they pretty much canceled out.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.178
Where did you get that from?

18:16.845 --> 18:18.055
Who are you talking to?

18:26.480 --> 18:29.149
If you already know everything,
why am I here?

18:29.233 --> 18:30.692
We want to hear your version.

18:30.776 --> 18:31.652
No.

18:32.194 --> 18:33.695
There are plenty of versions.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.698
- There's only one truth.
- Exactly.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.910
That's why we need to talk to you,
we're a team.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.433
<i>Thank you, Spain.</i>

19:04.226 --> 19:07.062
<i>-Thank you very much, from the heart.</i>
- Cut!

19:10.607 --> 19:13.610
Is it true it'll only be
a five-minute interview?

19:13.694 --> 19:15.612
Yes, dear, I'm sorry. You know.

19:15.696 --> 19:16.738
How can it be?

19:16.822 --> 19:19.283
I sing my best and only get five minutes?

19:19.366 --> 19:21.827
You know how TV works.
There just isn't more time.

19:21.910 --> 19:24.872
Exactly, and since I know
how TV works, let's do this.

19:24.955 --> 19:28.667
I'll talk about showbiz
in my answers, okay?

19:28.750 --> 19:30.919
Yeah, I can talk about Perales.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.421
I've partied with him!

19:32.504 --> 19:35.757
- Or about a Mexican, José José's drinking.
- Don't talk about that.

19:35.841 --> 19:36.842
You know?

19:36.925 --> 19:39.344
I could tell you things, but listen.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.138
That's all I ask.

19:42.431 --> 19:45.809
Anita, you know five minutes
doesn't give me a chance to talk.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.895
Come on, give me a little more.

19:47.978 --> 19:51.231
Okay, 15 minutes is all I can do, okay?

19:51.315 --> 19:53.317
Great, you get me, girl.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.359
Because I like you.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.069
- I'll call you this week.
- Sure.

19:58.906 --> 19:59.948
What is it?

20:00.032 --> 20:02.701
What? We have a 15-minute interview.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.161
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen minutes!

20:04.244 --> 20:08.415
- What will I talk about for 15 minutes?
- How should I know? Follow my lead.

20:08.498 --> 20:12.377
- Only fools watch TV, don't you worry.
- How does this dress look?

20:12.461 --> 20:13.545
I made it today.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.923
<i>Bella!</i>

20:16.006 --> 20:17.341
Let me see.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.552
<i>Sei bellissima!</i>

20:21.678 --> 20:23.472
Yeah, sure.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.516
But touring is also tiring,
going back and forth.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.186
Traveling the world,
even if we're packing stadiums.

20:29.269 --> 20:30.437
Like in Mexico.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.649
But you miss home, I miss Spain.

20:33.732 --> 20:34.566
Of course.

20:34.650 --> 20:35.609
Also,

20:35.692 --> 20:38.862
I know you've toured South America.

20:38.946 --> 20:41.073
And I want the public to know,

20:41.156 --> 20:42.908
you've been quite successful.

20:42.991 --> 20:46.787
I even heard you played Carnegie Hall
in New York, is that right?

20:48.246 --> 20:50.832
Yeah, there too, thank you.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.793
Marcela, how about you?

20:54.044 --> 20:56.922
How do you keep the family together

20:57.005 --> 20:59.716
with someone as famous as Luis?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.554
Well--

21:04.638 --> 21:07.182
Actually, we are both lucky

21:07.265 --> 21:11.561
to be artists, top artists.

21:11.645 --> 21:15.357
We support each other,
we lead a common and fantastic life.

21:15.941 --> 21:17.943
I didn't know. Are you an actress?

21:18.527 --> 21:21.446
You didn't know Marcela is a model?

21:21.530 --> 21:23.282
- No.
- She's an international model.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.075
- You didn't know?
- No.

21:25.158 --> 21:28.161
She's done shows in Paris, Milan, Madrid--

21:28.245 --> 21:29.329
Go on, tell them.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.164
Tell the audience

21:31.248 --> 21:32.833
about your shows.

21:32.916 --> 21:35.377
Who are your favorite designers?

21:35.460 --> 21:36.628
Go on, don't be modest.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.676
I think what's going on here

21:42.759 --> 21:44.636
is she has trouble speaking Spanish.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.596
And being on TV makes her nervous.

21:46.680 --> 21:49.891
She still isn't fluent in Spanish.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.352
But listen, the first time
we went to Paris,

21:52.436 --> 21:54.021
to the Dior office,

21:54.104 --> 21:56.648
was with your cousin,

21:56.732 --> 21:58.483
with Rossana Podestà.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.068
The actress?

22:00.152 --> 22:03.113
- A family of artists, Luis, amazing!
- That's right.

22:03.196 --> 22:05.032
<i>Let me take this opportunity to say</i>

22:05.115 --> 22:07.534
<i>I still have some concerts</i>

22:07.617 --> 22:10.078
<i>that are almost sold out.</i>

22:10.162 --> 22:12.414
<i>But there is still time to buy tickets</i>

22:12.497 --> 22:15.417
<i>and enjoy Luisito Rey's show,</i>

22:15.500 --> 22:17.377
<i>blood, passion, and lots of flamenco.</i>

22:19.713 --> 22:23.091
Then, the bastard spoke ten minutes
about that model.

22:24.384 --> 22:25.427
She was an actress.

22:26.011 --> 22:27.596
My mother didn't even know her.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.228
But anyway, that's who Dad was, right?

22:36.104 --> 22:38.065
And that's what they want for the show.

22:44.279 --> 22:47.783
Don’t tell me you want everyone
to know all the stuff Dad pulled.

22:49.659 --> 22:52.204
I don't know, Micky.
Maybe not, but think about it.

22:53.705 --> 22:56.041
Hey, if the show
doesn't portray him as he was,

22:56.792 --> 23:00.712
wouldn't you be doing exactly what he did

23:00.796 --> 23:01.880
in that interview?

23:05.425 --> 23:08.762
I'm not saying I like it,
but I'd rather they tell the truth

23:09.429 --> 23:10.764
than paint him out to be

23:11.515 --> 23:12.557
father of the year.

23:12.641 --> 23:15.602
And then, Miguel wants me to remember

23:15.685 --> 23:17.437
a nice anecdote about Dad.

23:18.146 --> 23:20.440
What can I say? There's nothing to say.

23:21.108 --> 23:23.527
- Want to hear something I remember?
- Okay.

23:25.195 --> 23:26.113
Dad

23:27.406 --> 23:29.825
didn't care about anything

23:31.243 --> 23:32.244
but you.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.161
Yeah,

23:34.037 --> 23:35.288
because he lived off me.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.250
No,

23:39.709 --> 23:40.669
that wasn't it.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.423
He admired you.

27:29.939 --> 27:31.983
Hurry! Move it!

27:32.067 --> 27:33.443
We'll be late, dammit!

27:34.152 --> 27:36.529
Hurry! Come on, Micky!

27:36.613 --> 27:38.198
We're really late!

27:38.281 --> 27:39.157
Hurry!

27:39.908 --> 27:41.284
- I knew it.
- Come on.

27:41.368 --> 27:44.537
- Careful! Come on!
- Move it, hurry up!

27:44.621 --> 27:46.873
- Hurry!
- I can't wait to hear the sermon!

27:46.956 --> 27:49.167
My head's spinning
from the party last night.

27:49.250 --> 27:51.753
- Luis, help me, will you?
- Move it, Micky!

27:51.836 --> 27:53.129
- Careful.
- I'll get Alex.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.299
- We're here.
- Move it! Hurry up!

27:56.883 --> 27:58.468
Good afternoon. Hurry!

27:58.551 --> 28:00.970
...grant them peace and unity,

28:01.054 --> 28:04.099
Thou who livest and reignest,
forever and ever.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.058
Amen.

28:05.892 --> 28:07.519
The peace of the Lord

28:07.602 --> 28:09.604
be with you all always.

28:11.606 --> 28:14.025
I don't have anything on me. Next time.

28:16.653 --> 28:17.529
Marcela,

28:18.279 --> 28:19.114
Luis.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.574
How nice to see you here.

28:22.075 --> 28:24.244
I'm glad you brought the kids.

28:24.327 --> 28:26.037
- Yeah.
- It's our pleasure.

28:26.121 --> 28:28.039
What a sermon, Father.

28:28.123 --> 28:30.417
Made me think of so many important things.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.334
I'm glad.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.669
My apologies,

28:32.752 --> 28:36.297
but we have a problem with the choir.
A boy couldn't make it.

28:37.215 --> 28:39.717
Maybe one of your sons could help us.

28:39.801 --> 28:41.553
Micky, go on. Go with the priest.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.390
- I don't want to, Dad.
- We're in the house of the Lord.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.809
Here, you do as the priest
and your dad say.

28:47.892 --> 28:50.395
- So, go on!
- Mom, I don't want to.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.398
- Cut it out! Go with the priest.
- Go on, Micky!

28:53.481 --> 28:56.359
All you need to do
is follow the other kids.

28:56.443 --> 28:59.320
- You know all the songs.
- It'll be five minutes.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.656
Then, you'll be back with your parents.

29:02.157 --> 29:04.909
You're spoiling him. Damn it!

29:04.993 --> 29:07.579
Make some room
in the middle, please. Good.

29:14.002 --> 29:15.628
Wake me up when it's over.

29:40.904 --> 29:41.821
Marcela, damn it.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.073
Can you hear him?

30:28.910 --> 30:30.370
<i>Andiamo a dormire.</i>

30:33.581 --> 30:35.750
Baby, let me handle this.

30:35.833 --> 30:36.668
You?

30:37.544 --> 30:39.504
What? I can't read him a bedtime story?

30:41.297 --> 30:43.049
Hold on, I'll give you yours later.

30:48.888 --> 30:51.349
All right, tuck yourself in.

30:51.432 --> 30:53.309
There you go. Cozy up there.

30:53.393 --> 30:55.019
Are you reading me a story?

30:55.103 --> 30:56.312
No, later.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.691
First, we'll talk
about something important.

31:01.985 --> 31:02.819
Micky,

31:03.945 --> 31:04.988
you have a gift.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.031
Do you know what that is?

31:08.533 --> 31:09.784
Singing?

31:09.868 --> 31:11.035
That's right.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.745
You sing too.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.455
Yeah, I do.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.583
But no.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.044
I can't do what you do.

31:21.504 --> 31:23.172
I can't sing the way you do.

31:24.674 --> 31:26.217
Anyone can sing.

31:27.051 --> 31:27.969
But talent,

31:29.178 --> 31:30.346
that's something else.

31:33.016 --> 31:34.517
Look, son, listen.

31:35.018 --> 31:36.561
Your dad talks a lot,

31:36.644 --> 31:38.479
but I only know two things.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.480
The first

31:39.564 --> 31:41.065
is how to get ahead

31:41.149 --> 31:43.359
in this world full of assholes.

31:43.443 --> 31:44.360
The second

31:46.070 --> 31:47.071
is music.

31:49.782 --> 31:50.658
One day

31:51.743 --> 31:53.745
the whole world will hear your voice.

31:54.704 --> 31:55.705
I promise.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.209
But you'll have to listen to me

32:00.293 --> 32:01.336
and do as I say.

32:01.919 --> 32:02.754
Get it?

32:06.674 --> 32:07.675
I love you.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.345
<i>I rarely saw him like that.</i>

32:12.430 --> 32:15.224
And to think
he heard me singing in a church.

32:17.852 --> 32:19.520
I didn't know that, man.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.111
What's in the book is true.

32:28.154 --> 32:30.198
My parents never married, and yes,

32:31.240 --> 32:33.743
my dad left the hospital
without paying the bill.

32:35.244 --> 32:37.497
And he told us about it with pride.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.539
That,

32:40.291 --> 32:41.584
and lots of more stories.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.797
I can't tell you
that he was a good person.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.345
Or that he was a good husband.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.348
And much less a good father.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.770
What I can tell you...

33:05.775 --> 33:07.944
is he was the first person
to believe in me.

33:10.905 --> 33:11.948
So, tell it all.

33:12.532 --> 33:14.826
All his tricks, his cons.

33:14.909 --> 33:16.703
But not a word about Aracely.

33:19.122 --> 33:20.748
And let me make one thing clear.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.963
My father gave me the only thing I have.

33:29.257 --> 33:30.091
He--

33:34.178 --> 33:35.596
He gave me music.

33:41.686 --> 33:42.812
<i>It went well today.</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:45.481
<i>I'd say really well, man.</i>

33:49.902 --> 33:52.238
I have to talk to Garduño and Warner.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.159
Record the album, do some concerts--

33:56.242 --> 33:57.785
- Yes.
- Everything, man.

33:57.869 --> 33:58.786
Music

34:00.496 --> 34:01.622
is all I have left.

34:02.415 --> 34:03.291
No, Micky,

34:03.958 --> 34:05.209
it isn't all you have.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.378
And you know it.

41:54.803 --> 41:58.015
MEXICO CITY, 2000

41:58.098 --> 41:59.350
I know it's hard to hear,

41:59.433 --> 42:03.729
but Robles and his cousin took money
to pay for publicity for <i>Nada es Igual.</i>

42:06.148 --> 42:07.399
That's stealing, Micky.

42:08.817 --> 42:09.985
However you look at it.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.742
Fucking hell!

42:17.368 --> 42:20.120
I swear to God, I'll kill him!

42:20.746 --> 42:22.248
That was all I needed!

42:24.166 --> 42:25.918
You're so stupid, man!

42:27.753 --> 42:31.173
I gave him the keys
to my company, to my tours, to everything!

42:31.257 --> 42:32.633
Well, it's done, Micky.

42:32.716 --> 42:33.842
Damn! They played you!

42:34.468 --> 42:36.178
They made sure you didn't know.

42:38.931 --> 42:41.558
I need your help, Ambrosi.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.562
Could you run the offices
while I handle this?

42:45.271 --> 42:47.314
Of course, I can do that.

42:48.315 --> 42:49.400
Thanks.

42:49.483 --> 42:50.609
I mean it, thank you.

42:50.693 --> 42:51.569
No thanks needed.

42:52.403 --> 42:53.654
That's what I'm here for.

43:08.836 --> 43:09.795
Is everything okay?

43:10.796 --> 43:11.755
What are you doing?

43:17.595 --> 43:18.887
It's called yoga.

43:20.389 --> 43:21.557
I learned it in India.

43:23.600 --> 43:24.435
Hey, Micky.

43:26.228 --> 43:27.563
- How are you?
- You're here.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.108
Want me to pour you a whiskey?

43:35.404 --> 43:36.363
No whiskey?

43:37.031 --> 43:38.115
Okay.

43:40.659 --> 43:41.702
Want to sit down?

43:41.785 --> 43:43.412
I knew you were many things,

43:44.830 --> 43:46.874
but not an idiot.

43:48.625 --> 43:49.460
Excuse me?

43:49.543 --> 43:51.545
Did you really think

43:51.629 --> 43:53.922
you could use my account
without telling me

43:55.132 --> 43:56.133
and steal from me?

44:01.847 --> 44:03.515
I didn't steal a dime from you.

44:04.933 --> 44:08.479
Aries took out a loan
to promote your album, it gave you back--

44:08.562 --> 44:11.482
I don't give a damn
if you gave it back or not, asshole!

44:12.524 --> 44:14.735
You stole from me,
and no one steals from me!

44:14.818 --> 44:18.405
Sorry, but I was doing my job,
just as you asked.

44:18.489 --> 44:22.534
You told me you wanted the whole country
to know <i>Nada Es Igual</i> was out.

44:22.618 --> 44:23.994
You couldn't even do that.

44:27.206 --> 44:28.248
You're fired.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.208
Get out of here.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.669
I'm sorry, Micky...

44:33.879 --> 44:35.381
but you can't fire me.

44:38.592 --> 44:41.053
When you signed the contract for <i>Songbook,</i>

44:41.720 --> 44:45.140
you also signed over
80% of the company to me.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.439
I did it for your own good.

44:53.023 --> 44:56.151
So your whims wouldn't bring us all down.

44:56.902 --> 45:00.614
You won't throw me away
as you did with all your other managers.

45:04.284 --> 45:07.830
Listen, asshole, I'll tell you
the same thing I told McCluskey.

45:07.913 --> 45:09.832
None of this exists without me.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.875
<i>You</i> don't exist without me.

45:16.213 --> 45:18.424
And without me, you don't have <i>Songbook.</i>

45:20.175 --> 45:21.552
What are you talking about?

45:21.635 --> 45:24.555
Aries and I own the project,
along with David.

45:26.849 --> 45:29.852
But you just don't read what you sign.

45:35.065 --> 45:35.899
See?

45:36.984 --> 45:38.819
That's what I was worried about.

45:38.902 --> 45:40.946
That's how you ended up fighting

45:41.029 --> 45:43.991
with one of the top
producers in the world.

45:44.658 --> 45:47.786
It would be difficult expanding
into the international market

45:47.870 --> 45:50.581
after getting on someone
like David Foster's bad side.

45:51.206 --> 45:53.167
Just what happened with the duet.

45:55.711 --> 45:56.628
For your own good,

45:57.671 --> 45:59.923
I hope what you're saying are all lies.

46:01.550 --> 46:02.676
Otherwise,

46:03.886 --> 46:04.928
I'll fuck you over.

51:05.187 --> 51:10.192
