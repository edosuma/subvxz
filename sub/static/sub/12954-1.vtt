WEBVTT

00:05.153 --> 00:06.153
Okay.

00:06.843 --> 00:08.052
Whatever it is, I can handle.

00:08.839 --> 00:10.383
Just don't tell me you are a bad guy.

00:15.217 --> 00:16.468
You're not a bad guy, are you?

00:20.232 --> 00:21.277
What?

00:21.278 --> 00:23.236
It's no accident
that I was the one you came to

00:23.645 --> 00:26.151
when you walked into the C.I.A.
with your story about SD-6.

00:26.152 --> 00:28.318
Vaughn, I don't understand.
What are you telling me?

00:29.151 --> 00:31.193
Well, for starters,
my name isn't Michael Vaughn.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074

01:16.022 --> 01:17.022
Vaughn?

01:26.892 --> 01:27.897
Vaughn?

01:27.935 --> 01:29.771
Don't worry.
We're gonna get you outta here.

01:29.801 --> 01:30.813
Is he okay?

01:30.851 --> 01:32.203
You just stay still, all right?

01:34.800 --> 01:36.133
I don't need anything. I'm fine.

01:38.238 --> 01:39.279
I don't need any of that.

01:41.050 --> 01:42.739
The girl's alive.
We'll take care of her.

01:42.740 --> 01:43.740
Copy four minutes out.

02:53.481 --> 02:54.482
There she is!

03:55.320 --> 03:57.385
We're gonna run a few tests
just as a precaution,

03:57.386 --> 03:58.636
but everything appears normal.

03:59.695 --> 04:00.695
When can I go home?

04:00.946 --> 04:01.947
Soon.

04:02.324 --> 04:03.907
But you're gonna have to take it easy.

04:04.259 --> 04:05.259
Of course.

04:17.259 --> 04:18.283
Miss Bristow?

04:19.084 --> 04:20.110
How you feeling?

04:22.640 --> 04:24.724
Oh, Gordon Dean,
Office of Special Investigations.

04:26.388 --> 04:27.388
Any word on Vaughn?

04:27.640 --> 04:28.641
No, I'm afraid not.

04:29.854 --> 04:32.825
I hate to do this now, agent Bristow,
given what you've been through.

04:32.826 --> 04:34.034
I already called in a report.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.473
Yes, I know. I just need for you
to clarify a few things,

04:36.511 --> 04:37.723
if that's all right with you.

04:39.698 --> 04:42.240
In your report, you indicated
you two were going on vacation.

04:43.449 --> 04:45.115
- You didn't say where.
- Santa Barbara.

04:46.137 --> 04:47.804
And you were struck about halfway there?

04:48.386 --> 04:49.386
About that, yeah.

04:49.698 --> 04:50.990
What about before the accident?

04:51.137 --> 04:53.262
Did agent Vaughn seem anxious,
perhaps preoccupied?

04:55.198 --> 04:57.240
He seemed relaxed.
We were taking a few days off.

05:00.198 --> 05:01.698
You're not writing any of this down.

05:01.886 --> 05:03.802
You are not telling me
anything worth writing.

05:04.081 --> 05:07.011
I'm telling you exactly what I remember.
I mean, if that's not enough--

05:07.012 --> 05:08.012
You two are engaged.

05:08.259 --> 05:09.426
- Isn't that correct?
- Yes.

05:09.464 --> 05:11.194
And you understand
that marital privilege

05:11.195 --> 05:13.028
does not trump
matters of national security.

05:13.428 --> 05:14.448
Of course I do.

05:14.449 --> 05:16.824
Then I am asking you
to remember where your loyalty lies.

05:17.136 --> 05:18.803
My loyalty? My fiancé was just abducted.

05:19.449 --> 05:21.407
Perhaps.
That's what we're trying to determine.

05:21.636 --> 05:23.262
Wait a minute. What are you suggesting?

05:24.885 --> 05:26.135
Whatever information you need,

05:26.384 --> 05:28.010
my daughter will be happy to cooperate,

05:28.134 --> 05:30.259
but she's just been through
a traumatic experience.

05:30.382 --> 05:31.966
I'm sure you can afford her some time.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.486
Of course, Director Bristow.

05:34.069 --> 05:35.077
We'll talk again.

05:35.778 --> 05:36.870
Soon.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.070
Thank you.

05:41.525 --> 05:42.525
Dad.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.442
Sydney, when your mother defected,
I spent a year

05:45.463 --> 05:48.004
in prison because the C.I.A.
assumed I collaborated with her.

05:49.214 --> 05:51.173
Before you say anything
that may implicate you,

05:51.212 --> 05:52.462
we need to go over your story.

05:52.588 --> 05:53.922
My story? Dad, what is going on?

05:55.399 --> 05:57.065
Vaughn is currently under investigation.

05:57.337 --> 05:59.838
There have been a number of red flags
raised by his conduct.

06:00.650 --> 06:01.650
What red flags?

06:01.774 --> 06:03.691
Langley believes
Vaughn may be a double agent.

06:04.900 --> 06:06.941
They think the crash
may have been an extraction.

06:16.523 --> 06:18.356
I've been hearing about you
for a long time.

06:25.148 --> 06:26.940
It's nice to finally meet you,
Mr Michaux.

07:34.766 --> 07:35.766
You've had a bad day.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.832
Where's Sydney?

07:38.390 --> 07:39.681
She's in better shape than you.

07:41.015 --> 07:42.141
Your shoulder's dislocated.

07:44.828 --> 07:45.828
We'll take care of that.

07:47.643 --> 07:48.643
I, uh...

07:50.638 --> 07:52.139
I believe this was intended for you.

07:59.139 --> 08:01.056
Oh, come on.
Don't tell me you're not curious.

08:05.887 --> 08:06.887
Open it.

08:21.077 --> 08:22.077
Catchy, but dated.

08:34.825 --> 08:36.284
You mind telling me what this says?

08:43.760 --> 08:45.677
- 5, 7, 3, 8, 4.
- We know what this is about.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.760
We know who sent it.

08:48.388 --> 08:49.930
What we don't know is where's Lehman.

08:51.259 --> 08:52.259
Who?

08:54.134 --> 08:55.342
You must be in a lot of pain.

08:56.324 --> 08:58.115
Maybe that's why
your memory's a bit fuzzy.

09:00.008 --> 09:01.424
Why don't we help Mr Michaux out?

09:10.759 --> 09:13.676
It flew somewhere. Those helicopters
are stealth. They're not invisi...

09:14.698 --> 09:15.823
Then retask the satellites.

09:17.071 --> 09:18.696
All right, call me back with something.

09:18.756 --> 09:19.756
- Syd.
- Any word yet?

09:21.823 --> 09:22.823
No.

09:23.381 --> 09:24.922
But there is a guy here from Langley,

09:25.572 --> 09:27.197
- and he's been insinuating...
- I know.

09:29.381 --> 09:31.090
Why was Vaughn
assigned to be my handler?

09:31.802 --> 09:32.818
What do you mean?

09:32.819 --> 09:35.028
Six years ago,
when I walked into that C.I.A. office,

09:36.320 --> 09:37.778
why was Vaughn assigned to my case?

09:39.692 --> 09:40.900
I don't know. He asked to be.

09:42.192 --> 09:43.734
You came in. You were all screwed up.

09:43.757 --> 09:45.882
You had that freaky red hair.
He likes a challenge.

09:48.007 --> 09:50.298
Hold it. You're not actually
considering this, are you?

09:52.066 --> 09:54.067
Syd, the idea that he's disloyal,
that's insane.

09:55.506 --> 09:56.506
Yeah.

09:58.819 --> 10:00.235
Just tell us what we want to know.

10:00.878 --> 10:02.254
I'm tired of playing these games.

10:03.566 --> 10:04.566
Quitter.

10:06.693 --> 10:08.693
Are you really gonna hold out
until we kill you?

10:11.754 --> 10:12.754
I can respect that.

10:15.191 --> 10:17.107
It seems Mr Michaux
needs a little incentive.

10:20.318 --> 10:21.776
Go down the hallway to his fiancée.

10:23.376 --> 10:24.793
- Bring her in?
- Just her finger.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.877
- Leave her out of this.
- That's up to you, isn't it?

10:30.251 --> 10:31.251
The one with the ring.

10:35.377 --> 10:36.710
Kind of poetic, don't you think?

10:37.127 --> 10:38.128
Stop!

10:42.626 --> 10:43.704
The message,

10:44.305 --> 10:45.355
it's in code.

10:47.257 --> 10:48.318
I need a pencil.

10:52.203 --> 10:53.703
Can you speed it up, agent Blinkman?

10:53.890 --> 10:55.056
Flinkman. With an "f" sound.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.891
Not that hard, really.

11:00.211 --> 11:03.027
Look, I know you wanted me
to access agent Vaughn's personal files,

11:03.056 --> 11:05.512
but I'll tell you right now,
you're not gonna find anything.

11:05.513 --> 11:06.804
No one is judging agent Vaughn.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.015
If he was up to something,
I'd know about it.

11:09.263 --> 11:10.263
I mean, we're friends.

11:10.765 --> 11:11.765
We do lunch.

11:13.137 --> 11:14.138
How much longer?

11:24.451 --> 11:25.451
- Hey.
- Hey.

11:36.697 --> 11:37.697
How are you holding up?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.326
What if I was wrong about him?

11:49.637 --> 11:51.762
Sydney, you remember
when we were working for SD-6,

11:53.444 --> 11:54.445
that night on the pier?

11:55.446 --> 11:57.321
I caught you breaking
into a secure facility.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.176
You asked me to trust you, but I didn't.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.552
The proof was right in front of me.
You were a traitor.

12:05.695 --> 12:06.903
If I had to do it over again,

12:08.507 --> 12:10.090
I'd give you the benefit of the doubt.

12:19.259 --> 12:20.259
Is there a problem?

12:21.756 --> 12:23.839
I can't write. Would you mind
setting my shoulder?

12:43.156 --> 12:44.156
Where's Sydney?

12:44.219 --> 12:45.219
Where is she? Answer me!

12:46.781 --> 12:47.865
She escaped. She got away!

13:13.653 --> 13:14.820
- Hello?
- Sydney, you okay?

13:15.589 --> 13:16.589
Thank God.

13:18.277 --> 13:19.278
I'm fine.

13:20.656 --> 13:21.656
Hang on.

13:29.026 --> 13:30.151
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

13:30.207 --> 13:31.334
Where are you?

13:31.372 --> 13:33.917
- Look, I know you have questions.
- About a million of 'em.

13:33.936 --> 13:36.263
I'll tell you everything
as soon as I can, but, Sydney,

13:36.282 --> 13:37.804
no one can know you're talking to me.

13:37.832 --> 13:39.926
I need my father's watch.
You need to get it to me.

13:39.954 --> 13:42.819
Do you remember the dead drop
we used to contact Tessina, the lockers?

13:42.841 --> 13:43.841
Of course I do...

13:47.715 --> 13:48.715
I don't know.

13:48.775 --> 13:50.525
Syd, please,
I need you to do this for me.

13:54.149 --> 13:55.191
I need to think about it.

13:57.595 --> 13:58.647
Where is he?

13:58.713 --> 14:00.336
I don't know what you're talking about.

14:00.337 --> 14:02.878
By withholding information,
you're only implicating yourself.

14:03.586 --> 14:04.837
I'll give you one more chance.

14:09.089 --> 14:12.047
Sydney, I understand your inclination
is to protect Vaughn at any cost,

14:13.275 --> 14:14.275
but assume you're right,

14:14.713 --> 14:17.088
that this wasn't an extraction,
that Vaughn was abducted.

14:17.962 --> 14:20.920
Then even if he's escaped, he's still
in a tremendous amount of danger.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.461
If you really wanna protect him,
let us bring him in safely.

14:33.895 --> 14:34.895
He's in Mexico City.

15:03.381 --> 15:05.006
- Perimeter's set.
- Good. Let's do it.

15:12.254 --> 15:13.254
Go, go, clear!

15:17.567 --> 15:18.567
You're looking for this?

15:37.376 --> 15:38.376
I want the truth.

15:39.876 --> 15:40.876
Start with your name.

15:41.564 --> 15:42.564
André Michaux.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.227
I'll tell you the rest on the way.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.083
7 years ago, a woman came to me,

16:12.391 --> 16:14.541
said that her father
had been involved in a project,

16:14.580 --> 16:17.060
something that people had gone
to great lengths to cover up.

16:17.061 --> 16:18.477
She said my father was part of it,

16:19.558 --> 16:20.891
said it was called Prophet Five.

16:21.186 --> 16:23.519
- You father was an agent.
- Before he joined the C.I.A.

16:24.749 --> 16:27.165
She said his name was Michaux,
that he was a mathematician.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.372
The day you walked into the C.I.A.,

16:37.373 --> 16:40.206
you described a mission-to-secure device
made by a man named Muller,

16:40.432 --> 16:42.933
the same man I was told
originated the Prophet Five project.

16:43.872 --> 16:46.414
Now this was my first proof
that this woman's story was true.

16:46.619 --> 16:48.785
But whatever it was
my father was running away from,

16:49.307 --> 16:51.016
he changed his identity,
he changed mine.

16:51.353 --> 16:52.686
I was 18 months old at the time.

16:53.352 --> 16:55.103
And this man we're meeting,
James Lehman--

16:55.432 --> 16:57.536
Renée and I have been trying
to find him for years.

16:57.537 --> 16:59.120
We believe he worked with our fathers.

16:59.413 --> 17:00.622
Renée who? Who is this woman?

17:01.849 --> 17:02.849
Renée Rienne.

17:03.412 --> 17:04.413
Vaughn!

17:35.161 --> 17:36.245
The watch-- show it to me.

17:43.223 --> 17:44.557
You were supposed to come alone.

17:45.099 --> 17:46.640
Whatever you say to me, she can hear.

17:49.909 --> 17:50.909
Follow me.

17:56.473 --> 17:58.807
I was prepared to bring
agent Vaughn in for questioning.

18:00.757 --> 18:01.971
You think I know where he is?

18:01.972 --> 18:04.098
Oh, I think it's possible, yes.
Your daughter, too.

18:07.033 --> 18:08.033
I don't.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.160
Then I have no choice.

18:09.534 --> 18:11.450
I am now officially
classifying him a fugitive

18:12.347 --> 18:13.680
and your daughter an accomplice.

18:14.346 --> 18:16.180
Now if you want me to show her
any leniency,

18:16.722 --> 18:18.138
find her and tell me where she is.

18:21.658 --> 18:23.033
Maybe you should try Mexico City.

18:24.971 --> 18:27.013
You'll be notified
when they've been apprehended.

18:29.533 --> 18:31.199
- Hey, Mr Dean.
- What is it, Marshall?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.321
He's not gonna find Sydney
and Vaughn, not from what I gave him.

18:36.529 --> 18:38.112
I encrypted Vaughn's files, 4,096-bit.

18:38.780 --> 18:39.780
It'll take 'em years.

18:40.530 --> 18:41.946
I mean, he's an ass. Deal with it.

18:43.155 --> 18:44.488
Do you still have the originals?

18:45.155 --> 18:46.155
Get them for me.

18:50.404 --> 18:51.695
Before I start, you should know

18:52.968 --> 18:55.509
your father did everything he could
to protect you from this.

18:57.219 --> 18:59.135
Mr. Lehman,
I want to know about Prophet Five.

19:02.152 --> 19:03.152
I was a cryptologist,

19:03.901 --> 19:05.985
a specialist in patterns
working for the Pentagon.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.509
In 1972, a private foundation
recruited me along with others,

19:12.154 --> 19:14.237
scientists, linguists,
the best and the brightest.

19:17.214 --> 19:18.505
That's where I met your father.

19:18.652 --> 19:19.653
What was the objective?

19:20.850 --> 19:22.225
We were given one page of a book,

19:23.352 --> 19:25.103
the "Profeta Cinque,"
"the Fifth Prophet."

19:27.350 --> 19:30.517
A 15th-century text that supposedly
had been written in an unbreakable code.

19:32.223 --> 19:33.807
And they wanted you to break the code.

19:34.286 --> 19:36.036
- Were you successful?
- After years, yes.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.868
It referred to proteins,
amino acids, nucleotides.

19:40.975 --> 19:42.892
It seemed to be some sort of
advanced genetics

19:42.911 --> 19:44.077
500 years ahead of its time.

19:45.224 --> 19:47.141
Just a few days after
we turned in our report,

19:47.787 --> 19:48.828
your father contacted me.

19:50.976 --> 19:52.851
He told me what was happening
to the others--

19:53.600 --> 19:55.851
accidents, car crashes,
fires, heart attacks, strokes,

19:57.349 --> 19:58.890
all people involved with the project.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.558
So I followed your father's advice.

20:03.349 --> 20:04.350
I changed my name.

20:05.658 --> 20:06.658
I disappeared.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.766
What's changed now?
Why did you contact us?

20:11.097 --> 20:12.722
Over the years, I've developed sources,

20:13.597 --> 20:14.689
leads as to where

20:16.790 --> 20:18.389
the book might be stored,

20:19.021 --> 20:20.854
but all my attempts
at recovery have failed.

20:21.834 --> 20:22.835
You have another lead.

20:27.585 --> 20:28.876
These people, whoever they are,

20:30.834 --> 20:32.126
when they know you're on to it,

20:32.894 --> 20:34.519
they'll stop at nothing to silence you.

20:40.082 --> 20:41.665
I'll contact you when I have the book.

20:52.602 --> 20:53.603
Thank you, Sir.

20:53.728 --> 20:54.728
Your invitation, please.

21:11.275 --> 21:12.776
My husband is right. It is my fault.

21:14.513 --> 21:15.513
Go ahead.

21:37.007 --> 21:39.174
I was sitting over there.
I misplaced my sunglasses.

21:58.819 --> 21:59.819
We're waltzing.

22:00.506 --> 22:02.298
Yeah, I've been practicing
for our wedding.

22:03.194 --> 22:04.239
With whom?

22:04.740 --> 22:05.795
Weiss.

22:55.936 --> 22:58.186
- Hey, I found the junction box.
- Ready when you are.

22:59.490 --> 23:00.490
It's been customized.

23:01.238 --> 23:02.654
Hang on. I'll call you right back.

23:05.177 --> 23:07.172
- Hello?
- Do you remember what you said,

23:07.174 --> 23:08.466
if you had to do it over again?

23:09.182 --> 23:10.357
What do you need ?

23:10.421 --> 23:14.655
Service records, pan Global Security,
serial number 16154131.

23:29.747 --> 23:30.956
Just admiring the collection.

23:36.931 --> 23:38.389
It's pretty gruesome if you ask me.

23:39.371 --> 23:40.437
My dad's really into guns.

23:41.638 --> 23:42.947
I think he's overcompensating.

23:46.012 --> 23:47.795
You're Walter, aren't you?

23:49.140 --> 23:50.140
What gave me away?

23:51.389 --> 23:53.389
Dad's always going on
about the new guy at work.

23:57.699 --> 23:58.783
Aren't you a little young?

24:00.076 --> 24:02.159
I'm a little young
to be stuck at this snore-fest.

24:03.827 --> 24:06.702
Looks like the safe's been rerouted
through the central alarm system.

24:06.886 --> 24:07.887
You'll need to repatch.

24:08.448 --> 24:09.489
Do you see a purple wire?

24:09.573 --> 24:10.573
- Yes, I do.
- Cut it.

24:11.513 --> 24:12.513
Got it.

24:12.576 --> 24:13.992
Okay, tie it to the last terminal.

24:14.135 --> 24:15.676
My dad's threatened by you, you know?

24:16.199 --> 24:17.199
I very much doubt that.

24:17.686 --> 24:18.739
Seriously...

24:18.840 --> 24:20.186
he's so lame.

24:21.497 --> 24:22.504
But you're young,

24:22.705 --> 24:23.767
smart,

24:23.768 --> 24:24.847
cute.

24:26.385 --> 24:29.168
You know, this party would be
a lot more fun if we were naked.

24:29.635 --> 24:30.760
That's not going to happen.

24:31.510 --> 24:32.510
- Done.
- That's it.

24:32.761 --> 24:34.553
You just need to reset the system
and wait.

24:36.385 --> 24:38.844
You know, there are better ways
to get back at your father.

24:39.385 --> 24:40.427
None that involve me...

24:41.328 --> 24:42.393
and you.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.484
Whoa, okay.

24:47.421 --> 24:48.421
You need to leave now,

24:48.484 --> 24:51.150
or your dad's gonna find out
what his little girl's really like.

24:51.860 --> 24:52.861
Jerk.

25:03.920 --> 25:04.945
Oh, Dixon,

25:04.946 --> 25:06.821
- Thank you!
- Be safe.

25:16.169 --> 25:17.169
Oh, Walter?

25:19.733 --> 25:20.858
Guess you're getting fired.

25:30.044 --> 25:31.544
I'm heading to the extraction point.

25:31.733 --> 25:32.734
Sydney?

25:33.481 --> 25:35.272
This is Dr. Park.
Your test results are in.

25:36.292 --> 25:37.584
Now isn't really the best time.

25:37.731 --> 25:39.731
- Let me get--
- You're gonna want to hear this.

25:47.606 --> 25:48.606
We have to go.

25:51.042 --> 25:52.042
The doctor called.

25:53.790 --> 25:54.790
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

25:55.891 --> 25:57.491
You two ! Stop right there!

26:17.017 --> 26:18.018
Arvin.

26:20.391 --> 26:22.350
- Nadia-- how is she?
- There's been no change.

26:23.926 --> 26:25.265
I have to get out of here, Jack.

26:25.814 --> 26:27.881
If you're not prepared
to charge me with a crime,

26:27.909 --> 26:28.950
you have to do something.

26:28.951 --> 26:30.492
I am trying to expedite your release.

26:30.952 --> 26:31.952
It's not enough.

26:33.449 --> 26:35.491
My daughter is being kept in a coma,
a coma Jack.

26:36.516 --> 26:38.891
She's suffering from a condition
that no one understands.

26:38.951 --> 26:41.785
It is a condition that I am
responsible for with no hope for a cure.

26:46.290 --> 26:47.574
I can't help my daughter

26:47.975 --> 26:49.241
sitting in a cell

26:49.264 --> 26:50.930
coming through obscure medical journals.

26:52.324 --> 26:53.324
I know.

26:58.700 --> 26:59.700
I'm sorry, Jack. I...

27:02.137 --> 27:03.888
You didn't come here for that.
What is it?

27:05.388 --> 27:07.972
Are you aware of the off-book trips
Vaughn took to Marseilles,

27:08.325 --> 27:09.408
3 over the last 12 months?

27:10.513 --> 27:12.305
They occurred
while you were head of A.P.O.

27:13.135 --> 27:15.218
If you're looking
to find out if I tasked him. No.

27:17.259 --> 27:18.384
Tell me what this is about.

27:26.163 --> 27:27.163
Serbia, two years ago.

27:28.540 --> 27:29.541
Istanbul, 2001.

27:34.913 --> 27:36.288
Are you familiar with Le Corbeau?

27:37.162 --> 27:39.063
The Raven, Renée Rienne.

27:39.228 --> 27:40.228
That's right.

27:40.536 --> 27:43.662
She's wanted for the assassination
of the Turkish Interior Minister in 2001

27:44.412 --> 27:47.037
and for the murders
of 3 C.I.A. agents stationed in Serbia.

27:49.365 --> 27:50.823
Vaughn's movements track with hers.

27:55.740 --> 27:56.907
Does Sydney know about this?

27:59.363 --> 28:00.363
Tell her, Jack.

28:12.227 --> 28:13.352
Tell me you have something.

28:14.353 --> 28:15.353
4,096-bit. Not bad.

28:17.044 --> 28:18.538
But whoever screwed with these files

28:18.539 --> 28:21.154
he used a modified version
of D.O.D.'S encryption algorithm.

28:21.289 --> 28:23.706
I hacked in Tenesse's network
and pull the decryption key.

28:24.292 --> 28:25.292
What did you find?

28:25.413 --> 28:27.538
Your fugitive used a handful
of documented aliases,

28:28.041 --> 28:30.332
one of which passed through
Italian customs last night.

28:31.352 --> 28:32.353
You're a genius.

28:33.877 --> 28:34.877
Yeah, I know.

28:42.123 --> 28:43.123
He said 9. We're early.

28:50.686 --> 28:51.977
Are we both gonna just sit here

28:52.186 --> 28:54.269
and not talk about the thing
we're thinking about?

28:56.875 --> 28:58.208
Where are you with this, Vaughn?

28:58.684 --> 29:00.060
I just need to know how you feel.

29:01.748 --> 29:02.789
Is it something you want?

29:05.349 --> 29:06.349
The truth?

29:06.978 --> 29:07.978
Of course.

29:11.913 --> 29:14.164
What we do, the things
we see every day, honestly, no,

29:16.480 --> 29:18.106
I didn't think this is what I wanted...

29:18.164 --> 29:20.705
I mean, bringing a baby
into this world that is so messed up,

29:21.539 --> 29:23.415
I just assumed that I'd wait,
that we'd wait.

29:25.979 --> 29:26.980
For?

29:27.728 --> 29:29.394
For things to be safe or at least safer.

29:30.917 --> 29:31.929
Yeah.

29:33.130 --> 29:34.217
I get it.

29:38.104 --> 29:39.178
But looking at you,

29:41.580 --> 29:43.438
all I can think about is

29:44.354 --> 29:45.895
what our kid is gonna be like and I'm

29:47.353 --> 29:48.519
not worried about the world.

29:48.783 --> 29:49.852
I just..

29:49.853 --> 29:51.686
I can't wait
to meet this new little person.

29:55.603 --> 29:56.603
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:58.852 --> 30:00.227
I mean, it's pretty great, right?

30:03.353 --> 30:04.978
Yeah and you're gonna be
an amazing mom

30:06.039 --> 30:08.415
and I'm gonna be a disaster.
I've never changed a diaper.

30:08.474 --> 30:11.140
Neither have I. We're gonna have
to call Marshall for an assist.

30:18.163 --> 30:19.163
He's here.

30:21.349 --> 30:22.349
You should go.

30:22.517 --> 30:23.517
Okay.

30:24.702 --> 30:25.703
I'll be right back.

30:27.454 --> 30:28.454
Start thinking of names.

31:01.949 --> 31:02.949
Can you decode it?

31:03.325 --> 31:04.325
It'll take awhile.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.407
When I'm done, I'll contact you.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.135
From now on, do not initiate
contact with me.

32:37.467 --> 32:38.467
Vaughn.

32:41.543 --> 32:42.543
God.

33:17.421 --> 33:18.482
He's still in surgery.

33:18.519 --> 33:20.429
No one's come out.
No one's told me anything.

33:20.430 --> 33:22.055
I hope you understand what you've done.

33:22.163 --> 33:23.177
What?

33:23.215 --> 33:25.431
Your heroic efforts
to help Vaughn were shortsighted.

33:25.432 --> 33:27.723
You acted impetuously
without the benefit of the facts.

33:27.747 --> 33:29.251
You don't know
what you're talking--

33:29.288 --> 33:31.082
Sydney,
Vaughn is not the person you think.

33:32.680 --> 33:34.347
He's been working with a known criminal.

33:34.368 --> 33:35.368
Renée Rienne. I know.

33:36.304 --> 33:38.555
Then what on earth
prompted you to risk your own life,

33:38.618 --> 33:40.409
not to mention
your professional integrity?

33:40.681 --> 33:41.681
Dad, Vaughn and I,

33:45.554 --> 33:46.554
we're having a baby.

33:48.742 --> 33:51.450
There's an explanation for all of this
if you'll let me tell you.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.741
Is he out of surgery?

33:56.053 --> 33:57.095
He's in recovery now, but

33:58.115 --> 34:00.031
the organ damage he sustained
was significant.

34:01.616 --> 34:03.866
Our expectation is
that we will stop the bleeding, but

34:06.554 --> 34:08.094
we'll know more in the next 24 hours.

34:08.568 --> 34:09.612
I need to see him.

34:09.612 --> 34:11.655
Well, you can wait in his room
until he wakes up.

34:14.856 --> 34:15.856
Sydney.

34:18.417 --> 34:19.501
I will do everything I can

34:20.915 --> 34:21.915
to help you both.

34:31.853 --> 34:32.914
Yes?

34:32.915 --> 34:34.268
I just spoke with Director Chase.

34:34.268 --> 34:36.018
Gordon Dean
wasn't Special Investigations.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.663
He went off the grid two years ago.

34:37.956 --> 34:39.248
- Status?
- He's presumed dead.

34:56.206 --> 34:57.206
Hi.

35:00.830 --> 35:03.121
Gordon Dean is a ghost,
well-placed and well-connected.

35:09.079 --> 35:10.079
What are we gonna do?

35:11.953 --> 35:13.620
Hey, I just broke about 30 federal laws.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.387
If I get caught, I'll be sharing a cell
with a guy named Bruno.

35:16.388 --> 35:18.222
It's white collar.
More like Martha Stewart.

35:19.138 --> 35:20.429
I contacted our Italian friend.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.201
He's got the passports.

35:22.578 --> 35:25.036
He'll coordinate the transport
as soon as Vaughn is stable.

35:25.543 --> 35:26.576
What's the outlook?

35:26.577 --> 35:28.452
Sometime in the next 24 to 48 hours,
we hope.

35:28.503 --> 35:29.517
Weiss, are you there?

35:29.555 --> 35:30.736
Yeah, I've got the blueprints

35:30.737 --> 35:32.607
of the Cape Town villa
right in front of me.

35:32.636 --> 35:35.472
We're gonna have no problem getting in,
but we will need two teams.

35:35.557 --> 35:36.899
You have my full authorization.

35:36.956 --> 35:38.317
What about the Pentagon records?

35:38.373 --> 35:39.696
Well, I already cross-referenced

35:39.697 --> 35:41.680
the 1972 archives
for the name "Prophet Five."

35:41.727 --> 35:42.788
So far, no luck.

35:42.825 --> 35:44.534
Keep looking.
Go back at least ten years.

35:44.951 --> 35:46.076
Someone might have slipped.

35:50.699 --> 35:51.740
I've always liked "Owen."

35:56.200 --> 35:57.200
Owen.

35:57.824 --> 35:59.699
That sounds like
something you name a gerbil.

36:02.887 --> 36:03.887
"Clementine" is cute.

36:06.011 --> 36:07.012
For a fruit.

36:08.199 --> 36:09.199
It's also a name.

36:11.262 --> 36:12.345
It's also a campfire song.

36:13.573 --> 36:14.823
Okay, you don't like that one.

36:17.133 --> 36:18.133
What about "Isabelle"?

36:24.761 --> 36:25.761
Isabelle Vaughn.

36:27.947 --> 36:28.947
Isabelle Bristow Vaughn.

36:32.505 --> 36:33.528
That's pretty.

36:34.930 --> 36:35.992
I like that.

36:38.341 --> 36:39.341
Me too.

36:45.026 --> 36:46.567
I'm sorry. I'm just getting so tired.

36:51.027 --> 36:52.528
Close your eyes. I'll be right here.

37:01.215 --> 37:02.215
Syd?

37:05.900 --> 37:06.900
I love you.

37:08.586 --> 37:09.586
I love you, too.

41:20.505 --> 41:21.505
Can I help you?

41:22.004 --> 41:23.212
You're a hard person to find,

41:24.940 --> 41:26.274
but if I can do it, so can they.

41:30.005 --> 41:31.714
Sorry,
no idea what you're talking about.

41:32.628 --> 41:33.711
I know who you are, Renée.

41:39.942 --> 41:40.942
We need to talk.

41:43.503 --> 41:44.754
We have nothing to talk about.

41:47.942 --> 41:49.026
It's about Michael Vaughn.

42:00.938 --> 42:01.938
You're Sydney.

42:02.252 --> 42:03.252
Yeah.

42:05.065 --> 42:06.065
How did you find me?

42:06.378 --> 42:07.379
I know everything.

42:09.875 --> 42:11.251
Then you should have walked away.

42:13.251 --> 42:14.417
You don't know me very well.

42:15.305 --> 42:21.922
