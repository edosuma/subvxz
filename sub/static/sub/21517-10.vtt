16:14.683 --> 16:16.143
And right now, I mean,
I'm trying

16:16.143 --> 16:18.523
to figure it out for you,
but this sits right here.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.320
At first, I was dubious, but now
that you've done it, I see it.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.026

fear is that it's... -No.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.197

-No, no, no, no, no, no.

16:27.196 --> 16:28.356
It's very innovative.

16:28.363 --> 16:29.863
It is not even remotely
too simple.

16:29.865 --> 16:33.325
I'm just concerned, like,
I'm not gonna do enough.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.537
I think you're at a juncture
where you're

16:35.537 --> 16:37.327
-thinking too much.
-Yeah.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.711
-Just do it.
-Okay.

16:39.708 --> 16:42.168
So the top is gonna be
really sleek and fitted.

16:42.169 --> 16:45.549
And one of the things that I was
looking at was the reflectors.

16:45.547 --> 16:47.717
Trying to cover the whole thing
with these. -Good.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.376
And then the bottom of it,
I wanted the bottom to be

16:50.385 --> 16:52.045
as big as I could
possibly get it.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.394
-Out of what?
-That.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.388
Oh. -The concept
that I was going with

16:55.390 --> 16:57.230
is that I wanted the bottom
to look like fire.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.386
I think this has the potential
for being incredibly chic.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.395
Oh, thank you.

17:01.396 --> 17:02.726
-Can I see this?
-Yes.

17:02.731 --> 17:04.070
I was still kind of debating

17:04.066 --> 17:05.566
about how to add
the volume, so...

17:05.567 --> 17:08.487
TIM: I think you let it do
what it does organically. -Okay.

mimics the shapes a little bit.

17:17.829 --> 17:19.459
all of the buckles

17:19.455 --> 17:23.076
and do a woven pattern
and create my textile.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.585
Why aren't you weaving it?
Why isn't it

17:24.586 --> 17:25.955
going in and out, in and out?

17:25.963 --> 17:27.713
Well, it'll be--
I won't have enough to do it

17:27.714 --> 17:29.224
-all the way through.
-Why don't you just

17:29.216 --> 17:32.256
put them into either vertical
or horizontal strips?

17:32.261 --> 17:34.931
Because you'll have
more material to work with.

17:34.930 --> 17:37.600
Yeah. -And is it all
going to be black?

17:37.599 --> 17:39.599
-Yeah.
-What do I keep saying to you?

-You need to turn up the volume.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.619

17:59.621 --> 18:02.461

-Yeah.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.640

18:19.641 --> 18:21.311
I mean, it remains
to be finished.

18:21.310 --> 18:24.060
Yes, yes. -But I'm confident
you can do it.

18:24.062 --> 18:24.692
Okay.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.518
So, I found this fire hose,

18:27.524 --> 18:29.784
and I kind of just,
like, took it

18:29.776 --> 18:31.146
because I like the color.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.953
And I didn't know
this expands into,

18:32.946 --> 18:36.946
like, actual fabric,
so I feel kind of lucky.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.990
-However...
-However?

18:38.994 --> 18:41.044
...it is actual fabric.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.828
-Yeah.
-So, the point is

18:43.832 --> 18:46.002
to transform whatever it is.

18:46.001 --> 18:48.791
And this is fabric
that you're using as fabric.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.335
-Mm-hmm.
-That concerns me tremendously.

18:51.340 --> 18:55.180

doesn't make it look better.

-I'm just gonna do, like,

We do a little bit of the brows
and really bright lips.

33:59.122 --> 34:01.672
-Stunning. Awesome.

MICHAEL: Why did I decide
to do the stupidest,

34:04.711 --> 34:06.501
hardest thing to put on?

34:06.505 --> 34:08.335
MARGARITA: <i>Michael's

34:08.340 --> 34:11.090
<i>Like, she is just like...

34:11.092 --> 34:12.893
<i>It's probably too sexy
for Nina.</i>

34:12.886 --> 34:16.005
I'm gonna trim it so it's not
gonna be that long. -Mm-hmm.

<i>Now I have an outfit.</i>

34:17.724 --> 34:18.684
<i>With no clothes,</i>

34:18.684 --> 34:22.143
it was "sexy,"
but with all of this,

34:22.145 --> 34:23.895
everything fits,
it-it goes together,

34:23.897 --> 34:27.476
and I'm not naked,
so I'm pretty happy about that.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.940
AYANA:My first thought is,
"Oh, my God,

34:29.945 --> 34:32.195
she looks like a doll.
Liris looks like a doll."

will think.</i>

34:34.283 --> 34:36.083
KENTARO:
That is cute.

34:36.076 --> 34:37.985
Hmm.

34:37.995 --> 34:39.405
I like the skirt,

34:39.413 --> 34:41.753
<i>but the top--
he's just clueless.</i>

34:41.748 --> 34:45.748
I look like Pocahontas
is about to go play football.

34:45.752 --> 34:48.882
Designers, in ten minutes,
you and your models and I

34:48.880 --> 34:53.130

Ten minutes. Thank you.

Could I have you,
like, hold it again?

34:58.891 --> 34:59.971
<i>My hands are...</i>

34:59.975 --> 35:01.175
like, drenched in sweat,

35:01.185 --> 35:02.635
<i>and it's pretty impossible</i>

35:02.644 --> 35:03.904
<i>to zip the dress up.</i>

35:03.896 --> 35:07.766
And if she walks out
with a half-open zipper,

35:07.774 --> 35:09.864
<i>my entire dress will collapse.</i>

35:09.860 --> 35:11.860
This is not right.

35:13.030 --> 35:15.200
Uh-oh.

35:15.199 --> 35:16.239
My sleeve falls off.

35:16.241 --> 35:18.121
What is this?
Nope, we gotta take this off.

35:18.118 --> 35:20.408
<i>I was running so late
that I just kind of glued</i>

35:20.412 --> 35:22.712
the bottom part of the sleeve,
and I knew it was a risk.

35:22.706 --> 35:26.626
I literally put these on seconds
before the end of the night.

35:26.627 --> 35:27.587
<i>I am very concerned</i>

35:27.586 --> 35:28.746
that the sleeve might fall off

35:28.754 --> 35:30.384
when she goes
to rip the caution tape off,

35:30.380 --> 35:32.970

The majority was bungee cord.

42:42.604 --> 42:47.444
I did the interior bralette
out of the harness strapping.

42:47.442 --> 42:50.112
The skirt was all
out of ACE bandages.

42:50.112 --> 42:54.282
But my basic inspiration
was kind of beautifying bondage.

42:54.283 --> 42:55.743
Yeah, Michael, unfortunately,

42:55.742 --> 42:57.492
this is not one
of my favorite looks.

42:57.494 --> 42:59.954
It lacks drama.

42:59.955 --> 43:03.285
This was the unconventional-
material challenge.

43:03.292 --> 43:06.462
This is about freedom.
This is about creativity.

43:06.461 --> 43:09.461
And this feels
like a bandage dress.

43:09.464 --> 43:14.344
She looks like a backup dancer
for a music video.

43:14.344 --> 43:19.474
To be very blunt, I think she...
it's very hooker-ish.

43:19.474 --> 43:22.484
Looks a little, like,
tacky and cheap.

43:22.477 --> 43:23.637
Yeah, I'm not a fan.

43:23.645 --> 43:25.305
HEIDI:
I do kind of think

43:25.314 --> 43:28.154
she looks hot,
but when you do compare

43:28.150 --> 43:29.480
your look to everyone else's,

43:29.484 --> 43:32.154
it looks like you
didn't work as hard.

43:32.154 --> 43:34.164
-Yeah.
-The blue color pops.

43:34.156 --> 43:36.366
I like that color
and that texture,

43:36.366 --> 43:37.776
and that's kind of about it.

43:37.784 --> 43:40.244
And that line that's,
like, smooshing

43:40.245 --> 43:41.655
her boobs across,

43:41.663 --> 43:47.673
it's pushing it down, and it's
making this bralette not fit.

43:47.669 --> 43:50.379
I'm pretty disappointed here.

43:50.380 --> 43:51.800
HEIDI:
Kenya.

43:51.798 --> 43:53.668
I had two things.
I had a plastic boat,

43:53.675 --> 43:57.005
and I had a ton of seat belts.

43:57.012 --> 43:59.012
I took the seat belts,
and I came up

43:59.014 --> 44:01.354
with this idea
to make a dress of it.

44:01.350 --> 44:03.680
And I used the boat as structure

44:03.685 --> 44:06.515
to create the shape
of the dress.

44:06.522 --> 44:08.022
And then I added
a little bit of paint

44:08.023 --> 44:11.903
to give it a little bit of more
texture, kind of like a textile.

44:11.902 --> 44:13.362
I think this is very good.

44:13.362 --> 44:15.032
It has a lot of great detail.

44:15.030 --> 44:16.860
The little hat
that you made for her.

44:16.865 --> 44:19.525
I love that the seat belt
is actually the belt.

44:19.535 --> 44:21.035
Just simple-- boom, there it is.

44:21.036 --> 44:22.326
I don't know, in the back,

44:22.329 --> 44:24.369
-you couldn't really close it?
-The zipper broke.

44:24.373 --> 44:27.173
Soon as I put it on her,
it... it broke.

44:27.167 --> 44:30.037
HEIDI: But I think you created
a really cool dress

44:30.045 --> 44:32.375
made out of seat belts.

44:32.381 --> 44:33.551
ZAC:
What I'm impressed by

44:33.549 --> 44:36.049
is that then you painted
over the material,

44:36.051 --> 44:37.391
and that created dimension.

44:37.386 --> 44:41.636
I think you have to watch the
shapes-- not the most refined--

44:41.640 --> 44:43.890
but it was successful today.

44:43.892 --> 44:45.022
Thank you.

44:45.018 --> 44:47.728
This is an example
of how you can do drama

44:47.729 --> 44:51.399
and you don't need to put
everything and the kitchen sink.

44:51.400 --> 44:54.030
It is just a black dress,

44:54.027 --> 44:56.107
but the drama comes
in the silhouette,

44:56.113 --> 44:59.873
in the shine
and this stiffness to the dress.

44:59.867 --> 45:03.487
It's part of that
exaggerated silhouette.

45:03.495 --> 45:07.245
So it worked.
It was a high marks.

45:07.249 --> 45:08.419
Thank you.

45:08.417 --> 45:09.417
I agree with Nina.

45:09.418 --> 45:10.748
Like, you did keep it

45:10.752 --> 45:12.422
very classic and simple.

45:12.421 --> 45:15.171
I really, really like it.
I think it's great.

45:15.174 --> 45:16.344
Thank you, Kenya.

45:16.341 --> 45:17.381
Ayana.

45:17.384 --> 45:22.104
My look was intended to pull out
all the stops and take risks.

45:22.097 --> 45:25.267
The materials that I used
are a lifeguard float

45:25.267 --> 45:26.477
to make the shoulder pads,

45:26.476 --> 45:29.096
reflectors to get
broken-glass mosaic effect.

45:29.104 --> 45:32.734
This net is what road workers
use to kind of separate areas.

45:32.733 --> 45:35.823
I stitched together
some danger tape to make

45:35.819 --> 45:37.029
her hijab out of.

45:37.029 --> 45:38.779
This look is so fantastic.

45:38.780 --> 45:41.950
It is so over the top.
I just love it.

45:41.950 --> 45:46.450
I love the hard hat that really
gives it the extra oomph.

45:46.455 --> 45:47.955
It's sleek. It's modern.

45:47.956 --> 45:49.616
-It's chic.
-Thank you.

45:49.625 --> 45:50.625
This is hot.

45:50.626 --> 45:52.126
This was bold. This was big.

45:52.127 --> 45:55.297
I like you using
alternative materials.

45:55.297 --> 45:56.797
It has a real tactile quality.

45:56.798 --> 46:00.048
I personally felt that the top
is a teeny bit outdated.

46:00.052 --> 46:02.302
Give me a little bit
of, like, an '80s thing.

46:02.304 --> 46:05.064
It's a little cliché, the top,
but in general,

46:05.057 --> 46:07.637
I think this is superb work.

46:07.643 --> 46:10.143
She looked really
like she was on fire.

46:10.145 --> 46:13.805
I love the wrapping
of her headdress.

46:13.815 --> 46:18.355
I thought there was tremendous
manipulation of the skirt.

46:18.362 --> 46:21.662
The sense of drama,
the sense of elegance.

46:21.657 --> 46:26.037
My favorite part, actually,
is the pop of blue at the top.

46:26.036 --> 46:28.326
Like, as subtle as it is,
just tied

46:28.330 --> 46:30.160
all the colors together, too.

46:30.165 --> 46:31.165
Really, really cool.

46:31.166 --> 46:33.166
HEIDI: Margarita,
tell us about your look.

46:33.168 --> 46:36.128
I was very inspired
by the Lexus cars.

46:36.129 --> 46:38.669
They're super high-gloss
and chic,

46:38.674 --> 46:40.224
so I kind of wanted to create

46:40.217 --> 46:42.837
a cocktail dress
that had that vibe.

46:42.845 --> 46:46.675
First, I used the caution tape,
and I wove it.

46:46.682 --> 46:50.522
I attached these reflectors,
and then on top,

46:50.519 --> 46:51.849
these are kneepads.

46:51.854 --> 46:53.314
These pieces are hard hats

46:53.313 --> 46:55.523
that I sawed off,
and this piece

46:55.524 --> 46:58.194
was, like, a safety harness
that was really big.

46:58.193 --> 46:59.533
I had fun. It was really fun

46:59.528 --> 47:01.698
to experiment with a lot
of different things.

47:01.697 --> 47:03.197
I really like this, Margarita.

47:03.198 --> 47:06.738
I'm getting a superhero vibe
from her.

47:06.743 --> 47:08.123
It was innovative.

47:08.120 --> 47:10.830
I love the use
of the reflectors.

47:10.831 --> 47:12.961
The straps.
It's just very cool.

47:12.958 --> 47:14.498
-Thank you.
-CARLY: I kind of almost wish

47:14.501 --> 47:16.921
you brought a tiny...
like a... more of that blue

47:16.920 --> 47:19.380
and a hint of that into
the skirt maybe or something.

47:19.381 --> 47:22.011
But the shoulders on that,
with the hard hat,

47:22.009 --> 47:24.219
she could've just been
wearing that and a trash bag,

47:24.219 --> 47:25.219
and I would've loved it.

47:25.220 --> 47:27.600
-(chuckling)
-HEIDI: I loved it, too.

47:27.598 --> 47:29.018
I think this girl
is very modern.

47:29.016 --> 47:31.226
I feel like you could mix her
into some of the shows

47:31.226 --> 47:35.726
that you see in Paris right now
and she would fit right in.

47:35.731 --> 47:37.061
This was a high for me today.

47:37.065 --> 47:40.565
The textile you created
was really inventive.

47:40.569 --> 47:43.529
It creates dimension.
It's graphic.

47:43.530 --> 47:45.910
I like what you did with
the helmet on the shoulders.

47:45.908 --> 47:50.078
Your use of materials
is really quite wonderful.

47:50.078 --> 47:51.538
However, I will say

47:51.538 --> 47:53.578
that it was giving me
a little bit of

47:53.582 --> 47:56.582
a Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtle vibe.

47:56.585 --> 48:00.125
We've seen now
a bunch of your work.

48:00.130 --> 48:03.050
So, even though this
was successful for me,

48:03.050 --> 48:07.430
I don't still have an idea
of what your style is.

48:07.429 --> 48:08.759
You know, we saw...

48:08.764 --> 48:10.104
You'll have to see a collection.

48:10.098 --> 48:12.098
Well, I know, but I don't know

48:12.100 --> 48:14.560
what you have to say
about fashion.

48:14.561 --> 48:17.611
It's not a tight aesthetic yet
for me.

48:17.606 --> 48:18.936
HEIDI:
Kentaro.

48:18.941 --> 48:21.111
I used a fire hose.

48:21.109 --> 48:22.319
Wanted to make layers of fringe.

48:22.319 --> 48:25.399
These yellow parts are made
out of the yellow cone.

48:25.405 --> 48:26.735
This is what I created.

48:26.740 --> 48:30.580
This is not one
of my favorite outfits.

48:30.577 --> 48:32.447
I see a lack of vision.

48:32.454 --> 48:35.294
I just don't know when you
decided to take the direction

48:35.290 --> 48:39.460
that you wanted this to look
like a Native American costume.

48:39.461 --> 48:42.301
That was not part of
the challenge. -HEIDI: No.

48:42.297 --> 48:43.627
She almost looks like a doll.

48:43.632 --> 48:46.262
Like, it's all
a little bit too stiff.

48:46.260 --> 48:49.300
If her hair was in
a sleeked-back pony

48:49.304 --> 48:51.434
and she had simpler shoes on,

48:51.431 --> 48:53.471
it would have made all
the difference in the world.

48:53.475 --> 48:55.975
It's not, to me, very fashiony.

48:55.978 --> 48:57.978
And it just feels...

48:57.980 --> 49:00.230
a little basic.

49:00.232 --> 49:02.652
I love that you used
a fire hose.

49:02.651 --> 49:04.151
I think that play that you did

49:04.152 --> 49:07.152
between using the fringing
and the graphic pattern

49:07.155 --> 49:09.655
and the text is all you needed.

49:09.658 --> 49:13.488
The other elements on top of it
and the piping

49:13.495 --> 49:16.075
kind of brought
a kitsch element to it.

49:16.081 --> 49:20.841
I also feel that the top
is not fitting so beautifully.

49:20.836 --> 49:24.006
Not your best work today.

49:24.006 --> 49:25.166
Liris, how do you feel in it?

49:25.174 --> 49:27.684
There's a piece
that, like, cuts my arm here.

49:27.676 --> 49:29.336
Yeah, it's like fiberglass,
right?

49:29.344 --> 49:31.684
-Yeah. It's very stiff.
-Yeah, it's fiberglass.

49:31.680 --> 49:33.350
I've never seen you
this uncomfortable before.
