00:25.191 --> 00:27.227

00:28.294 --> 00:30.030
but something is wrong with me.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.331
My face feels weird.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.033
My hands and my feet

00:33.133 --> 00:35.402
Then my case went to a mental health

00:35.468 --> 00:37.270
and out of the blue, uh...

00:37.370 --> 00:38.605
I mean, can you believe it?

He actually thinks that this quack

00:41.174 --> 00:43.910
This guy who obviously needs help

00:44.010 --> 00:45.211
Narcissistic, if you ask me.

00:45.845 --> 00:46.746
I mean...

00:47.747 --> 00:49.349
This isn't normal. I'm babbling.

I can do this, yes.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.491
[Mat] I'll do the concerts.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.067
Okay...

01:41.167 --> 01:43.903
Whoa, crazy!

01:44.003 --> 01:46.239
- [Mat chuckles]

01:46.306 --> 01:49.042
Yeah, yeah. I had to do something.

01:50.510 --> 01:52.345
And what about Monika?

01:53.079 --> 01:55.548
Gone! She's vanquished.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.584
[sighs] Told you.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.787
And I'm ready to perform.

02:00.887 --> 02:01.955
- Really?

02:02.055 --> 02:05.024
And I need to earn money

02:06.993 --> 02:09.028
[sighs] ...be a father.

02:09.128 --> 02:10.430
- What?

02:11.731 --> 02:12.765
Susa's pregnant.

02:15.535 --> 02:18.271
Um, but you split up. At least

02:19.439 --> 02:22.575
And I need to win her back.

02:22.642 --> 02:25.345
I need to prove that I'm the best dad

02:25.445 --> 02:26.346
Wanna help?

02:31.851 --> 02:35.655
Yeah, but... do you really believe

02:35.722 --> 02:36.789
to get back together?

02:37.724 --> 02:40.527
You don't understand that

02:40.593 --> 02:42.295
That is so unfair.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.265

02:47.233 --> 02:49.769
Okay. I'll think about it.

02:56.576 --> 03:00.079
And, um... how are things

03:01.548 --> 03:03.082
Tino's going out with Lilo.

03:05.051 --> 03:07.053
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

03:09.589 --> 03:11.758
Well, he was too boring

03:13.092 --> 03:14.327
It's no big deal.

03:14.894 --> 03:16.229
What are you guys talking about?

03:16.829 --> 03:17.830
Nothing.

03:20.033 --> 03:20.967
Nothing.

03:23.436 --> 03:26.072
Wow! That really looks great.

03:26.172 --> 03:28.074

[in Australian accent] But you wanted

03:46.826 --> 03:49.829
And you also know where the room

03:49.929 --> 03:52.332
I thought you had a French accent,

03:52.398 --> 03:54.534
She's doing it again.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.402
I really think we shouldn't

03:56.469 --> 03:59.072
Jona, get off of her.

03:59.706 --> 04:01.307
This is not who we are.

04:02.508 --> 04:04.611
She came to us in desperation.

04:05.678 --> 04:06.679
And what did we do?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.449
[Monika sighs with relief]

04:13.152 --> 04:14.254
Desperation?

04:14.320 --> 04:16.255
Yeah, seeing you standing there

04:16.322 --> 04:18.691

04:18.758 --> 04:22.428
"I need to report this. I don't know

And what is, you know, um...

04:27.600 --> 04:31.971
well, this, um... in the chest

04:32.038 --> 04:33.239
- [Jona] Rage.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.108
Rage. I know that.

04:36.442 --> 04:40.046
It gives you the feeling of, like,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.648
Yeah, that's how it was with Mat.

04:41.714 --> 04:43.349
"Mat." [chuckles]

04:43.449 --> 04:45.084
She calls her case by his name.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.154
They will throw me

04:48.254 --> 04:50.056
They won't throw you

04:50.123 --> 04:52.792
At least, not if you stop acting

04:52.892 --> 04:53.960
What do you mean?

04:54.027 --> 04:55.995
[Fiona] You have to pull yourself

04:56.062 --> 04:59.165
You simply cannot let them see

05:01.434 --> 05:02.769

05:39.372 --> 05:40.807
My name is Monika.

05:46.245 --> 05:48.614
And I'm very glad that I finally

05:49.549 --> 05:51.184
[all] Hello, Monika.

05:54.787 --> 05:57.023
[keyboards tapping furiously]

06:09.402 --> 06:14.073
F32.1-1977/02, do you have

06:14.173 --> 06:15.274
No.

06:16.609 --> 06:18.444
Something quite bizarre happened

06:18.511 --> 06:20.880
and I wanted to talk to you

06:20.947 --> 06:25.184
After all, you're in charge

06:25.284 --> 06:27.387
And I think her mistakes

06:29.522 --> 06:30.823
I'm listening.

06:35.428 --> 06:36.996
I was just with my case

06:37.063 --> 06:38.865
and suddenly, while we were

06:39.932 --> 06:43.970
I could see F32.1-2011/01

06:49.075 --> 06:51.110
I know. That shouldn't be

06:51.210 --> 06:52.645
It's never happened to me before

06:52.712 --> 06:54.847
that I could see another colleague

06:54.914 --> 06:57.650
Hmm. Indeed, I've never heard

06:57.717 --> 06:59.652
That was no accident

06:59.719 --> 07:01.721
You were snooping around

07:01.788 --> 07:03.122
without a surveillance order.

07:03.189 --> 07:04.390
That is against the rules.

Monika?

You want her case.

14:07.646 --> 14:10.282
and we get depressed if we don't

14:11.250 --> 14:12.918
All you want is for him

14:12.985 --> 14:15.254
That's outrageous,

14:15.321 --> 14:16.388
Click it, come on.

14:16.488 --> 14:17.823
[Mat sighs]

14:17.923 --> 14:19.124
She helped me with the song.

14:20.326 --> 14:23.495
That might be true, but right now,

14:23.562 --> 14:24.663
[inhales deeply]

14:27.199 --> 14:28.267
[Monika inhales again]

14:31.170 --> 14:32.371
She loves you.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.809
I know.

14:41.313 --> 14:43.649
- What did she say?

14:43.716 --> 14:44.783
You're a bit too nosy.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.153
[sniffs] She believes you should

14:50.189 --> 14:51.123
[cell phone dings]

14:56.095 --> 14:58.731
[David] So fucking cool, man!

14:58.797 --> 15:00.332
I'm going to post it on Instagram,

15:00.399 --> 15:02.167
write a tweet and issue

15:02.234 --> 15:05.170
I love it. It's genius. And I'm

15:05.237 --> 15:08.274
They need to give you your own changing

15:08.374 --> 15:09.608
Love you, man. Love ya!

15:10.376 --> 15:11.744
[Mat sniffs and clears throat]

15:15.414 --> 15:17.516
I find it shitty what you're doing

15:17.583 --> 15:20.853
I hope at least you've had your fun

15:20.920 --> 15:22.054
She's not here anymore.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.957
Oh, yeah, she is.

15:25.557 --> 15:27.693
Always. Even when

15:30.195 --> 15:31.130
[sighs]

15:32.364 --> 15:33.866
- So...

15:35.668 --> 15:37.503
That's enough. No more refreshing.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.343
[sighs]

15:46.478 --> 15:47.413
[sniffs]

15:51.917 --> 15:52.851
[sighs]

15:56.288 --> 15:57.723
[sobs softly]

16:28.087 --> 16:29.955
[F31.1-1977/02] Proposed goal,

16:30.856 --> 16:33.425
Just like his file in the Archive

16:33.525 --> 16:36.161
No previous psychiatric disorders,

16:36.228 --> 16:38.430
No, nothing. Not even

16:39.231 --> 16:42.201
So, it's a spontaneous

16:43.035 --> 16:45.037
Yeah, that's why I want

16:46.038 --> 16:47.873
Uh-huh. And?

16:47.973 --> 16:51.276
I want to persuade my case to give

16:51.343 --> 16:54.313
then drive him to a breakdown

16:54.413 --> 16:56.648
Then he'll have no other choice

16:58.150 --> 16:59.084
Experimental.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.156
All right then. Good luck.

17:13.766 --> 17:19.605
I don't think that F32.1-2011/01

17:19.671 --> 17:21.073
We should order a surveillance.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.975
If this continues, we will lose

17:23.041 --> 17:26.879
No, a surveillance at this time could

17:26.945 --> 17:27.880
- But...

17:28.814 --> 17:30.215
My decision is final.

17:34.853 --> 17:36.488
[sighs deeply]

17:39.591 --> 17:41.026
[Monika breathing heavily]

17:53.439 --> 17:54.673
Hello, Monika.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.842
Hello, um...

17:56.909 --> 17:58.343
- Fiona.
- Fiona.

17:59.344 --> 18:00.612
Are you doing okay?

18:01.447 --> 18:02.347
Hmm...

18:10.155 --> 18:13.992
I think F32.1-1977/02...

18:14.093 --> 18:15.527
- Anna-Belle.

18:16.161 --> 18:17.496
Your supervisor.

18:18.864 --> 18:20.933
- I didn't know she was also...

18:21.433 --> 18:24.636
We just call her that. So, what's

18:26.572 --> 18:27.906
She might suspect that I...

18:29.241 --> 18:32.144
So, this name-giving habit, that's

18:32.244 --> 18:33.745
"Our thing," I'd rather call it.

18:33.846 --> 18:36.248
Since, after all, now you're

18:37.583 --> 18:39.051
- EMDs?

18:39.518 --> 18:43.589
Short for Exceptional Mental Disorder.

18:43.689 --> 18:44.923
The "s" makes it plural.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.628
I chose my name all by myself,

18:49.728 --> 18:51.864
although I would have been

18:51.964 --> 18:54.199
if it had been given to me

18:54.266 --> 18:56.401
but it just wasn't meant to be.

18:56.468 --> 18:58.437
[in French accent] It is all

18:58.504 --> 19:01.406
No, not at all. We are talking

19:01.473 --> 19:03.108
Oui, oui, oui, blah-blah-blah.

19:03.709 --> 19:07.746
[inhales sharply] You know, I've

19:07.846 --> 19:08.881
Oh, that's beautiful.

19:09.715 --> 19:12.251
[in Australian accent]

19:12.317 --> 19:13.252
You don't write songs.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.189
Did you tell Anna-Belle about it?

19:17.289 --> 19:18.390
No, no.

19:18.490 --> 19:21.426
[breathes deeply] But somehow

19:22.161 --> 19:24.930
Oh, that doesn't sound good.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.833
I reported to her I want

19:27.933 --> 19:31.103
that I want to push him deliberately

19:31.203 --> 19:33.872
[Fiona] But no drugs. You know,

19:33.972 --> 19:37.209
She only told Anna-Belle about it to

19:38.310 --> 19:39.945
How do I continue with my case?

19:41.146 --> 19:43.515
[melancholic music playing]

19:44.883 --> 19:46.351
[inhales deeply]

20:05.904 --> 20:07.072
Oh, sorry!

20:07.806 --> 20:10.709
No, all good. I was, uh...

20:13.111 --> 20:14.246
Are you okay?

20:15.147 --> 20:16.248
Yeah.

20:16.315 --> 20:17.249
Hmm.

20:19.151 --> 20:20.085
[Mat sniffs]

20:21.053 --> 20:22.120
You seem...

20:26.491 --> 20:27.559
Do you have the mopes?

20:28.193 --> 20:29.194
[he chuckles softly]

20:32.130 --> 20:34.199
- Is there anything I can do?

20:36.568 --> 20:38.003
I'm just a little bit tired.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.004
Mat...

20:40.772 --> 20:42.374
You know I love you, right?

20:46.278 --> 20:47.946
Yeah. Sure.

20:56.555 --> 20:58.423
I wanted everything to be okay

20:59.625 --> 21:01.326
I wanted to write a song for Susa,

21:02.160 --> 21:03.095
a concert.

21:04.363 --> 21:05.797
[inhales deeply]

21:06.598 --> 21:08.333
I even found myself a therapist.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.502
- [chuckles softly]

21:13.038 --> 21:14.439
Only that I'm normal.

21:16.241 --> 21:17.175
When do you go back?

21:19.011 --> 21:21.613
Hey, one-time therapy

21:21.680 --> 21:22.648
Look at you.

21:27.552 --> 21:28.487
What's his name?

21:29.187 --> 21:31.189
- Who?

21:32.791 --> 21:33.725
Um...

21:34.593 --> 21:35.727
Uh, Sellinger.

21:37.262 --> 21:38.196
Sellinger.

21:43.769 --> 21:44.770
Seriously?

21:47.906 --> 21:50.409
Oh, my God! The dude is

21:53.478 --> 21:54.680
I'll ask mine to see you.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.456
I've canceled all the concerts.

22:07.426 --> 22:08.527
[Nabil sighs]

22:09.528 --> 22:11.363
- How did David react?

22:13.065 --> 22:14.433
Bro, what are you doing here?

22:14.933 --> 22:16.735
Did you just beam over or what?

22:16.802 --> 22:18.403
We were just talking about you.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.672
[David] Yeah, I was just here

22:20.772 --> 22:24.276
Hey, I was at your house and they

22:24.343 --> 22:26.078
- Hi, Nabil.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.746
Yeah, um...

22:27.846 --> 22:29.314
Listen, can we just...

22:29.414 --> 22:31.316
Can we talk for a sec, business?

22:33.251 --> 22:34.453
Yeah, sure.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.122
But I have no secrets from Nabil.

22:37.189 --> 22:38.690
So, shoot.

22:39.424 --> 22:41.526
Okay, cool, um... Listen up, uh...

22:42.127 --> 22:43.795
'Cause they told me that, um...

22:43.895 --> 22:46.631
well, it would be tough to insure

22:46.732 --> 22:48.800
Well, I had to personally vouch

22:48.867 --> 22:51.636
that you wouldn't cancel

22:51.703 --> 22:54.973
Well, it's 80,000 euros penalty

22:55.040 --> 22:56.241
Why would you vouch for that?

22:57.175 --> 22:59.478
Yeah, I know, but I have...

22:59.544 --> 23:01.213
You know, my parents...

23:01.279 --> 23:04.082
My parents, they... It's because

23:04.149 --> 23:05.984
And I... I don't know.

23:06.084 --> 23:08.453
My dad said I'm a loser

23:08.520 --> 23:10.655
would never be able to pay them

23:10.722 --> 23:13.825
And my mother, she's basically

23:13.925 --> 23:16.294
Emotional! She runs around

23:16.361 --> 23:19.131
What... I... can't...

23:19.197 --> 23:21.032
I don't want to go back to Hagen!

23:21.133 --> 23:23.635
[sobbing] And, you know, I...

23:24.369 --> 23:26.671
Mat, please, I...

23:26.772 --> 23:29.174
I know you said that

23:29.241 --> 23:31.109
that it... that it absolutely

23:31.209 --> 23:32.744
and I know that you're not

23:33.345 --> 23:37.215
[sighs] I'm so sorry, but can't you

23:37.783 --> 23:39.518
[Nabil] Get a lawyer

23:40.352 --> 23:41.853
Maybe he can get you out of it.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.088
I've been to a lawyer.

23:43.155 --> 23:44.523
The contracts are watertight.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.727
Um... that's why I'm here.

23:52.330 --> 23:54.065
[electronic music playing]

23:58.170 --> 23:59.471
[distant cheering]

24:02.774 --> 24:05.310
Wow, the people out there are here

24:05.410 --> 24:06.545
Do you hear 'em?

24:06.645 --> 24:08.847
They're so hot for you.

24:08.914 --> 24:09.848
Are you ready?

24:10.749 --> 24:11.683
I can't.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.386
I'm so sorry, but I can't do this.

24:14.486 --> 24:16.087
Mat, look at me.

24:16.154 --> 24:17.255
Look at me.

24:17.322 --> 24:18.223
You can do it.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.225
I believe in you.

24:20.992 --> 24:23.395
- David...

24:23.495 --> 24:24.529
It'll be okay.

24:28.600 --> 24:31.770
You gonna rock that show!

24:33.104 --> 24:34.673
[Jona] I don't want to leave.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.075
Really, guys. This is too much.

24:37.175 --> 24:40.679
[Ophelia] Listen, Jona, of course

24:40.745 --> 24:43.248
[Jona] I can't do it.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.483
Can't I just stay here?

24:44.549 --> 24:47.486
[Ophelia] The best thing about my cases

24:47.552 --> 24:48.587
What is bothering you?

24:49.521 --> 24:51.323
- [Jona] Yeah.

24:51.389 --> 24:54.893
[Jona] Yeah, I like it a lot too, but

24:54.960 --> 24:56.228
Mat is kind of strange.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.599
He is so sad and, in a way,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.068
And hopeless.

25:04.302 --> 25:05.403
Not like before.

25:08.373 --> 25:10.675
Have you seen another PD with Mat,

25:11.610 --> 25:13.445
What? No. Why? That's impossible.

25:14.479 --> 25:16.681
Anna-Belle wanted to arrange

25:16.748 --> 25:20.252
I managed to stop her. I thought perhaps

25:24.523 --> 25:25.590
Bruno...

25:25.690 --> 25:28.693
- [Ophelia] Are you in therapy?

25:28.760 --> 25:29.895
When I was with him...

25:31.963 --> 25:36.034
I could really feel the love

25:37.168 --> 25:38.069
Yeah.

25:39.671 --> 25:41.039
That can be very moving.

25:42.908 --> 25:44.609
- Be more careful.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.849
Aah! [giggles]

25:51.316 --> 25:52.851
Monika, is everything okay?

25:52.918 --> 25:54.753
I don't know. Somehow

25:54.853 --> 25:57.689
It's so hot... Oh, oh, oh! Ooh!

25:57.756 --> 25:59.157
- [Fiona] Monika!

25:59.224 --> 26:00.892
- Monika!

26:00.959 --> 26:02.327
What's happening to her?

26:02.394 --> 26:04.529
- What's going on?

26:04.596 --> 26:07.432
Aah-aah! Mm-mm!

26:07.532 --> 26:08.600
[loud thud]

26:10.769 --> 26:11.970
Drugs.
