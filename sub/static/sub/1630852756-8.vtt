00:11.428 --> 00:12.262
The truth is--

00:24.650 --> 00:25.776
Sean.

00:27.778 --> 00:28.904
Sean.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.450
Hey, look at me.

00:38.205 --> 00:39.706
You don't wanna do this.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.502
Hey.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.063
There's nothing we can do for him.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.608
Shit. Natalie, come on.

01:06.692 --> 01:07.693
Natalie!

01:07.776 --> 01:09.611
- Fuck.
- Come on.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.780
Leave him. Now.

01:11.864 --> 01:12.906
Okay.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.763
Keep on going. Keep moving.
Keep moving to the road.

01:36.847 --> 01:37.890
Out of the way!

01:37.973 --> 01:39.099
Keep moving.

01:39.183 --> 01:40.893
- Where are we going?
- Away from here.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.144
Come on. Come on.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.573
Great work, team.

01:54.656 --> 01:58.452
All right, now, I wanna see you
challenge yourselves even more. So--

03:30.085 --> 03:31.962
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

03:32.045 --> 03:33.213
Keep it moving.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.133
No access to Times Square
from any direction.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.510
Hey, dude.
Sorry, what's going on in the Square?

03:38.594 --> 03:40.470
They put the Newman kid up
on the big screens.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.931
No access to Times Square
from any direction.

03:43.015 --> 03:46.185
Move away from the area.
We are closing the street.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.396
We've gotta get off the street. Come on.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.815
It's him! You look exactly like him, man.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.859
- Aadesh!
- It's okay. Come on. Come on.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.068
Tell the truth!

03:55.152 --> 03:58.155
Guys, let's move, please.
No. No questions. Let's go.

04:05.621 --> 04:07.581
- Do you know where he is?
- We're working on it.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.249
They're gonna kill him, aren't they?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.126
- Ms. Newman.
- They put this everywhere.

04:12.085 --> 04:15.422
We're sealing off Times Square
to stop a crowd from gathering, but yes.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.884
They hacked the game stream,
and they're flooding sites with it.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.261
Katherine?

04:22.429 --> 04:24.640
- I need to get you away from the hotel.
- Why?

04:24.723 --> 04:27.851
Because whoever set off the alarm
did so as a diversion.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.686
Why?

04:31.146 --> 04:32.898
Because they'd just
killed Martin Copeland.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.486
I'm so sorry to have to tell you that.

04:44.826 --> 04:46.078
Who shot him?

04:46.787 --> 04:48.288
The same people who took Leo?

04:48.372 --> 04:49.748
We can't be sure at this point.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.041
Do you know where they are?

04:51.124 --> 04:53.252
- We believe they're still in the--
- No.

04:54.086 --> 04:57.673
It's a simple yes or no question,
so why don't you just answer "no"?

04:57.756 --> 05:00.300
Do you see the problem?
Do you see what this is all about?

05:00.384 --> 05:02.636
Until we find him, which we will,

05:02.719 --> 05:05.180
- I need to move you out of the hotel.
- I need to see him.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.349
Who?

05:07.432 --> 05:08.433
Martin.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.144
I need to see him right now.

05:12.688 --> 05:14.731
- Ms. Newman--
- I told you I would not leave here

05:14.815 --> 05:16.066
until Leo is safe.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.068
Is he safe?

05:22.072 --> 05:23.073
No.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.964
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

05:39.047 --> 05:43.343
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

05:43.427 --> 05:45.053
Where the hell are we going?

05:45.137 --> 05:46.430
Let's keep moving.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.192
Keep up. We need to stay out of sight.

06:01.945 --> 06:02.988
I'm done.

06:03.906 --> 06:06.783
We're all fucking done, thanks to you.
Why'd you have to kill him?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.660
It's what I came here to do.

06:08.744 --> 06:10.329
- That is so selfish.
- Guys.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.663
What about us?

06:12.164 --> 06:14.291
I'm sorry, but I owe Monique

06:14.374 --> 06:16.710
- more than I owe you.
- We have to keep moving.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.214
I don't care what happens now.
I can just hand myself in.

06:20.297 --> 06:22.883
I'll tell them that none of you
had anything to do with it.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.427
Anything to do with what? The kidnap?

06:25.511 --> 06:27.846
You didn't kill anyone, okay?

06:29.473 --> 06:30.599
None of us did.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.354
It was Sean. It was all Sean.

06:37.773 --> 06:38.941
Now come on.

06:43.028 --> 06:44.321
There's a lift.

06:58.335 --> 07:02.172
Come on. One of these
fucking buttons has got to work.

07:02.256 --> 07:03.298
Shit.

07:04.550 --> 07:05.592
What?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.428
I left the gun in the room.

07:16.937 --> 07:18.146
Where'd you get it?

07:19.147 --> 07:20.148
Monique's friend.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.943
- Fuck.
- You're a good shot.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.613
I guess that's where we'll go then.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.448
I was aiming for his head.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.583
Let her through, but keep an eye on her.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.403
You said someone was trying to kill you?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.573
I haven't done anything wrong.

08:09.656 --> 08:10.949
No, Professor Cresswell.

08:11.033 --> 08:14.161
As we explained, you're not under arrest
or being accused of anything.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.997
- We just need your help.
- I need protection.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.415
From who?

08:20.667 --> 08:24.838
I live on this old barge, tethered.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.549
Hasn't moved in 25 years.

08:28.217 --> 08:32.054
I don't see anyone, but I could hear them.

08:33.554 --> 08:36.808
Outside. This week, Tuesday.

08:37.518 --> 08:39.436
Or maybe it was Wednesday.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.398
- What day is it today?
- We don't have a lot of time.

08:43.482 --> 08:45.526
Why did Leo Newman's kidnappers
show your picture?

08:48.612 --> 08:50.531
Do you know who Leo Newman is?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.369
I knew they'd come.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.093
Who's "they"?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.345
They buried everything.

09:14.888 --> 09:19.601
I tried to publish.
I did everything I could. Truly.

09:20.477 --> 09:25.357
But that's when it really started.

09:27.693 --> 09:31.947
Whisper, whisper, whisper. The whispering.

09:32.030 --> 09:35.325
About what?
About your relationships with students?

09:41.081 --> 09:42.165
Come on.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.212
And people believed those rumors?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.381
People? Yes.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.718
But not just people.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.138
Deborah was much younger than me when we…

09:58.557 --> 09:59.933
We fell in love.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.561
Twenty years younger.

10:02.644 --> 10:05.230
But even at 18, she--

10:06.690 --> 10:08.525
There was only ever her.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.485
How she could not see that, I--

10:10.569 --> 10:13.780
Okay, so your wife, Deborah,
she believed the rumors too.

10:13.864 --> 10:16.200
Not wife. We never married.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.327
But she left you?

10:18.869 --> 10:23.290
She said things you can't unsay.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.792
Or un-hear.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.669
Couldn't take the risk.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.048
Then gone.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.676
I never saw them again.

10:35.469 --> 10:36.470
- "Them"?
- "Them"?

11:04.414 --> 11:07.334
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:07.417 --> 11:13.382
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:13.465 --> 11:16.260
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:16.343 --> 11:19.388
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:21.181 --> 11:22.224
Holy shit.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.143
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:25.227 --> 11:28.146
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

11:31.608 --> 11:34.111
Billboards in Times Square.

11:35.988 --> 11:37.906
You said we'd know we made it

11:37.990 --> 11:42.202
when our clients were on billboards
in Times Square.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.001
A few desks and a coffee machine.

11:52.713 --> 11:56.049
You thought it was so cool
to be right in the middle of it all.

11:57.634 --> 12:02.306
And then we realized
why it was so goddamn cheap.

12:03.348 --> 12:06.768
The reality wasn't cool or exciting.

12:09.605 --> 12:12.816
It was… empty.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.278
And hollow.

12:18.572 --> 12:19.740
And dark.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.832
Stay where you are.

12:31.418 --> 12:34.588
Leo, where are the kidnappers?

12:36.507 --> 12:37.966
They are the kidnappers.

12:44.014 --> 12:45.015
You did this.

12:48.644 --> 12:50.229
What happened to us, Martin?

12:53.065 --> 12:55.234
Talk to us, Eric. You had a child?

13:01.156 --> 13:03.325
- Tara?
- Tara? No.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.119
- What are you doing?
- Tara, stop. Tara!

13:08.038 --> 13:11.041
Nobody could find me. But she did.

13:15.629 --> 13:19.424
Even as a baby, she was determined.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.555
- Hey.
- Leo, well done.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.306
Hi, honey. You okay?

13:26.390 --> 13:28.308
Once she set her mind to something--

13:28.392 --> 13:29.852
Is that Tara?

13:31.228 --> 13:32.354
- No Tilson?
- No.

13:33.397 --> 13:34.606
My Evie.

13:39.278 --> 13:40.737
- Hey! Hey, stop!
- You stop!

13:41.864 --> 13:43.365
- Nobody shoot!
- You bitch!

13:43.448 --> 13:45.826
- You lying fucking bitch!
- We all lied.

13:45.909 --> 13:48.120
- Step away from her.
- Lower the gun!

13:48.203 --> 13:50.038
You set me up! You set us all up.

13:50.122 --> 13:53.083
You let-- You let me kill Copeland!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.418
What?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.378
- Everybody stay calm.
- Leo.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.755
Martin's-- Martin's dead?

13:58.839 --> 14:01.842
Copeland might not have been part of this,
but he did send that rendition team.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.635
He admitted it. Monique is on him.

14:03.719 --> 14:05.929
No, it is on you. It is all on you!

14:06.013 --> 14:08.974
None of this would have happened
if it wasn't for what you have done.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.560
- Poor, innocent Natalie.
- What?

14:11.643 --> 14:13.937
You were chosen for a reason.
You all were.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.314
- Why?
- You know why.

14:15.397 --> 14:17.399
Because you're a part
of what makes it possible

14:17.482 --> 14:21.028
for Cooper Newman PR
to carry on ruining lives. Aren't you?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.406
Who the fuck are you?

14:24.489 --> 14:25.616
Leo, stop.

14:25.699 --> 14:27.618
No one was supposed to die.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.078
- Too late.
- Lower that gun.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.291
Is the rich white boy realizing
he doesn't control everything?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.209
You bitch.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.461
- Go on, shoot me.
- Natalie.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.838
Go on. Do it.

14:40.923 --> 14:44.259
I have got nothing left to lose
thanks to you.

14:47.763 --> 14:48.639
Tara?

14:50.724 --> 14:53.477
Did you really-- Did you really pla--

14:53.560 --> 14:56.271
Hey. Hey, hey. Okay. Okay, okay.

14:57.731 --> 15:01.026
You really planned this?
Right from the start?

15:01.693 --> 15:02.819
Not this part.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.073
It doesn't matter now
whether you believe me,

15:06.156 --> 15:08.742
but nothing after we were released
from the NCA was planned.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.786
The rest was us reacting.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.956
The four of us,
our links to CNPR and the masks,

15:14.039 --> 15:16.333
was meant to be a distraction
for the first 24 hours.

15:16.416 --> 15:17.501
Five of us.

15:18.627 --> 15:19.753
What?

15:20.295 --> 15:22.089
There are five of us.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.553
He had nothing to do with us.

15:27.636 --> 15:29.513
Right. So it's only me
that's innocent here.

15:30.264 --> 15:32.891
- Wait. None of that explains--
- I told you--

15:32.975 --> 15:34.893
- No.
- It's the only way we could get through.

15:34.977 --> 15:37.855
Yeah, but why here?
Why'd you bring us here?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.892
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

16:14.975 --> 16:16.935
Tell the truth! Tell the--

16:17.936 --> 16:20.522
We can't just stay here like this.

16:20.606 --> 16:23.317
Nobody's going anywhere
before Katherine Newman tells the truth.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.944
You must really hate her
to have done this.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.279
Or really love her.

16:28.238 --> 16:30.824
This was their first office.
No one knows that.

16:30.908 --> 16:33.660
They erased it from their story.
Doesn't fit the image.

16:34.203 --> 16:35.996
It's empty because the owners worked out

16:36.079 --> 16:40.959
the place is more valuable as advertising
space than for people to work or live in.

16:41.043 --> 16:43.587
Most people don't set out
to make the world worse.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.007
- Just happens.
- But it's not too late.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.550
It is for Martin.

16:49.259 --> 16:51.053
When my father died, he was there for me.

16:51.136 --> 16:52.763
He was there for both of us.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.932
Instead of all this,
couldn't you have got a therapist?

16:55.015 --> 16:56.558
It's not like you can't afford it.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.853
Okay. Well, let's say--

16:59.937 --> 17:02.439
Let's just say your mother does
whatever it is you want her to do.

17:02.523 --> 17:04.775
She has to tell the world
the truth about my father.

17:04.858 --> 17:08.069
That she lied
about his work and about him.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.073
- Cresswell's your dad?
- I don't give a fuck who he is!

17:11.156 --> 17:14.367
Okay, but what then? What happens next?

17:14.451 --> 17:16.744
He's just, what, supposed to go back home?

17:17.788 --> 17:20.207
And what about you? What about them?

17:25.712 --> 17:27.964
- No way.
- What?

17:28.048 --> 17:29.758
Don't you see what they're doing?

17:29.842 --> 17:35.138
They're trying to convince everyone
that we were the kidnappers all along.

17:35.222 --> 17:36.390
No, we're not.

17:36.473 --> 17:37.975
Because there's no need.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.518
They're already convinced.

17:45.023 --> 17:49.152
You can't seriously think you can just
create your own version of reality

17:49.236 --> 17:52.364
like we're all in some kind of
fucking computer game.

17:52.447 --> 17:53.657
Why not?

17:53.740 --> 17:57.828
The rich and powerful have been doing it
for years, and mostly no one complained.

17:59.913 --> 18:01.540
But now we can fight back.

18:04.543 --> 18:05.919
Look how easy it is.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.798
Top story on news feeds
from all over the world.

18:11.466 --> 18:13.927
They all seem to think this is reality.

18:14.011 --> 18:17.723
Someone is always in control.
The question is who and why.

18:19.141 --> 18:20.142
Where are they going?

18:20.225 --> 18:21.560
You can't afford to look away.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.271
This is my life. This is my real life.

18:24.354 --> 18:26.440
- You shoot me and I'll bleed.
- Like this?

18:27.482 --> 18:28.692
You think this is makeup?

18:30.277 --> 18:33.113
Yeah, well,
I'm not denying that I told lies.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.699
You got access
to Cooper Newman's dirtiest secrets.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.160
- But I didn't look at anything.
- Exactly!

18:38.660 --> 18:39.786
You're not an idiot.

18:40.579 --> 18:45.167
You knew precisely what CNPR is about,
and you had the chance to expose them.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.085
But it didn't even occur to you,

18:47.169 --> 18:49.505
because all you were thinking about
was getting a job.

18:49.588 --> 18:51.465
- I'm not one of the bad guys.
- You made a choice.

18:51.548 --> 18:53.091
Tara, please, you know me!

18:53.175 --> 18:56.053
You know us!
You know we're not the bad guys.

18:56.136 --> 18:59.431
- Does that make it better or worse?
- And none of us know each other.

19:01.183 --> 19:02.809
Do any of you really trust one another?

19:09.149 --> 19:12.152
Why didn't you say that you picked that up
from the hotel room?

19:16.657 --> 19:18.867
- What?
- My gun.

19:18.951 --> 19:21.703
I even said that I left it there.
Why didn't you say you had it?

19:21.787 --> 19:22.829
Because he's a cop.

19:25.290 --> 19:26.291
Aren't you, Eddie?

19:27.668 --> 19:29.920
- Eddie?
- Fuck it, man. Just tell 'em.

19:30.003 --> 19:31.296
Tell 'em what?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.382
He works for your mother.

19:33.882 --> 19:35.717
It's all right, Eddie. You can tell them.

19:39.263 --> 19:40.430
I'm sorry, man.

19:43.308 --> 19:44.643
You lied.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.311
- You--
- Aadesh, don't.

19:50.399 --> 19:51.441
How did you know?

19:51.525 --> 19:52.776
- We didn't.
- Not for sure.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.445
But we never would've got here
without you, would we?

19:58.073 --> 20:00.701
Please. What exactly did she tell you?

20:03.036 --> 20:04.204
Eric.

20:07.583 --> 20:09.209
I thought I'd lost her.

20:10.419 --> 20:11.628
Listen, sir.

20:12.504 --> 20:16.592
Your daughter is in a whole world
of trouble right now, okay?

20:16.675 --> 20:18.802
The kind of trouble
people don't get out of.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.138
- At least not alive.
- But you can still help her.

20:29.021 --> 20:31.190
I know what it's like
to lose a child, Eric.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.695
I was in the military.

20:38.030 --> 20:39.531
And my son…

20:41.241 --> 20:44.703
All he ever wanted to do was follow
in my footsteps. And he did.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.124
And he was so proud, you know?

20:53.504 --> 20:55.964
I saw that look on your face
when you talked about Evie.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.800
It's the same look he has
when he talks about his daughter.

21:04.932 --> 21:06.642
My son was killed, Eric.

21:08.852 --> 21:10.604
And now I'm never gonna see him again.

21:13.482 --> 21:17.110
All those years away from your daughter,
at least you had hope.

21:19.154 --> 21:21.406
That she might come back
into your life one day.

21:24.326 --> 21:26.495
And once you lose that hope…

21:28.914 --> 21:30.832
and that photo's all you have…

21:37.130 --> 21:38.131
Help us.

21:44.763 --> 21:45.848
Daisy.

21:50.686 --> 21:53.272
So, I finally got you a phone.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.650
By the time you watch this,
it'll all be over.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.444
Or it won't, because you didn't do
as you were told, as usual,

21:59.528 --> 22:01.113
and you're watching this early.

22:02.030 --> 22:03.031
Either way…

22:05.284 --> 22:07.953
you're probably gonna hear
a lot of things about me.

22:09.329 --> 22:13.792
And in case I'm not around,
I wanted you to hear my version

22:14.501 --> 22:16.211
so you can make up your own mind.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.923
I told you I don't know
who my birth father is.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.509
That's not true anymore.

22:24.386 --> 22:25.846
I always wanted to know.

22:25.929 --> 22:30.601
And after Gran died,
I felt like I could look properly.

22:31.685 --> 22:32.936
Took a while,

22:34.229 --> 22:35.564
but eventually…

22:38.025 --> 22:39.318
I found him.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.738
Your grandfather's name is Eric Cresswell.

22:43.363 --> 22:46.158
God, Daisy, you would love him.

22:47.784 --> 22:50.204
He never did
what anybody told him to either.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.415
And he's clever, like you.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.250
He found evidence

22:55.334 --> 22:58.795
that one of the biggest oil companies
in the world didn't want anyone to see.

22:59.338 --> 23:01.882
So their PR agency spread lies about him.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.760
They destroyed his reputation
and his life.

23:05.427 --> 23:06.637
And not just his,

23:07.304 --> 23:10.974
because lies, and the damage they do,
gets passed down.

23:11.058 --> 23:12.768
Generation to generation.

23:14.770 --> 23:16.855
Your gran took me away when I was little

23:16.939 --> 23:22.027
because she was worried I'd be affected
by what my real dad had done.

23:23.320 --> 23:25.030
Or what people said he'd done.

23:26.490 --> 23:29.576
And I understand that.
I don't blame her for it.

23:30.244 --> 23:31.954
But I think she was wrong.

23:33.330 --> 23:36.291
What parents do always affects their kids,

23:36.875 --> 23:38.085
no matter what.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.336
That's how it should be.

23:39.419 --> 23:43.465
…a lot of those chanting "Tell the truth"
tonight are younger people.

23:43.549 --> 23:44.550
Whatever happens,

23:44.633 --> 23:48.178
this feels like a new generation
demanding to be heard,

23:48.262 --> 23:51.014
saying, "We want
to do things differently now."

23:51.098 --> 23:53.642
I've learned from someone
not much older than you

23:53.725 --> 23:55.561
that it's not enough to disapprove.

23:57.688 --> 24:01.275
It's not enough to post a clever comment
on social media and get on with your day.

24:01.358 --> 24:02.526
It's too late for that.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.905
It's time people like Katherine Newman
paid for the lies they tell.

24:10.868 --> 24:15.038
And amongst other good news stories,
I have some of my own to announce.

24:15.122 --> 24:20.127
I can't tell you how proud it makes me
to confirm that my son, Leo,

24:20.210 --> 24:24.381
will be president of
the Cooper Newman Charitable Foundation.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.966
Effective immediately.

24:26.049 --> 24:27.092
Thank you.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.636
Come on up, honey.

24:30.596 --> 24:33.682
What I'll say is I'm proud
and excited about the future.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.767
I've learned from the best,

24:35.851 --> 24:40.355
but now I'm also gonna do things
my own way.

24:42.900 --> 24:45.152
…future. I've learned from the best,

24:45.235 --> 24:49.823
but now I'm also gonna do things
my own way.

24:50.449 --> 24:51.450
Thank you!

24:52.659 --> 24:53.994
Thank you.

25:04.505 --> 25:09.593
But most importantly, my Daisy Duke,

25:10.677 --> 25:13.055
above everything else,

25:13.138 --> 25:17.309
I just want you to know that I love you.

25:24.483 --> 25:26.652
Sorry to wake you, sweetheart.
I know it's late.

25:26.735 --> 25:29.655
But there are people on the phone.
It's about Mum.

25:31.031 --> 25:34.868
No, don't be scared.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

25:37.871 --> 25:38.705
I'm with her.

25:38.789 --> 25:41.625
Could Tara have been in touch with her
without you knowing?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.210
By email or any other way?

25:44.169 --> 25:46.672
Has Mum been in touch with you at all?

25:49.424 --> 25:50.259
No.

25:50.843 --> 25:52.761
You're positive she doesn't have a phone?

25:52.845 --> 25:53.720
I'm certain.

25:54.721 --> 25:57.850
Look, can you be more specific
about what exactly he said to her?

25:57.933 --> 26:00.853
He says that Tara told him
everything should become clear,

26:00.936 --> 26:03.313
but if not,
Daisy would be able to explain.

26:05.107 --> 26:08.443
You know it's important to always
tell the truth, sweetheart, don't you?

26:08.986 --> 26:11.947
Did Mum say anything to you
about meeting her real father?

26:13.031 --> 26:15.200
- No.
- No.

26:15.284 --> 26:17.995
Was there anything specific
about her New York trip?

26:19.037 --> 26:21.373
What about Mum's New York trip?

26:21.456 --> 26:24.501
Was there anything she said or did
that seemed a bit weird?

26:30.841 --> 26:32.509
What did she say about this?

26:33.927 --> 26:37.514
She didn't say anything.
Just where they do the big countdown.

26:37.598 --> 26:40.809
- What is it?
- It's-- It's a snow globe.

26:41.768 --> 26:43.061
She brought it back for Daisy.

26:43.145 --> 26:46.356
It's Times Square. It's the building
where they do the countdown.

26:46.940 --> 26:48.150
Number one, Times Square.

26:56.116 --> 26:57.951
I need you guys to leave, please.

26:59.453 --> 27:01.288
Everybody out. Clear the room.

27:02.164 --> 27:03.165
Thank you.

27:17.596 --> 27:18.597
Anything?

27:18.680 --> 27:21.350
No, but those sirens
are definitely getting louder.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.018
There's only another 10 minutes--

27:23.644 --> 27:25.312
Shit. Check the screens!

27:26.104 --> 27:27.397
Backup power's on.

27:27.481 --> 27:28.774
Oh, God!

27:36.240 --> 27:37.574
Drop the gun.

27:50.796 --> 27:52.422
Get me confirmation that was gunfire.

27:54.174 --> 27:56.927
You keep these protesters the hell
away from here. Understand?

28:00.806 --> 28:02.432
I'm still waiting for more

28:02.516 --> 28:05.352
on that increased activity
around Times Square, but--

28:07.104 --> 28:09.439
Okay. Okay. Right now?

28:12.526 --> 28:13.569
Give me the phone.

28:14.570 --> 28:17.197
Why? You said you'd already made contact.

28:17.281 --> 28:20.701
It doesn't matter now, does it?
They know we're here. They cut the power.

28:20.784 --> 28:23.954
- What if they come in shooting?
- I said give me the phone, Tara.

28:24.705 --> 28:25.706
Now!

28:29.334 --> 28:30.169
Eddie!

28:30.252 --> 28:31.795
You, you, over there.

28:32.379 --> 28:34.506
- Sean, please.
- Shut up.

28:34.590 --> 28:37.176
Hey, Leo. Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

28:37.759 --> 28:38.844
You don't scare--

28:40.012 --> 28:41.722
On your knees, all three of you.

28:45.100 --> 28:46.101
How did you find us?

28:47.186 --> 28:48.979
Tracker in your shoe.

28:51.148 --> 28:52.816
They weren't a part of setting you up.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.902
In that case, you two can go.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.362
Joke.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.531
He didn't set you up either.

29:03.285 --> 29:04.578
Why did you come back?

29:04.661 --> 29:06.914
I told you at the cottage,
someone will have to pay.

29:07.497 --> 29:10.209
You don't understand what this is, Sean.
What it could be.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.836
Problem is, I don't care.

29:13.545 --> 29:14.838
I don't believe you.

29:14.922 --> 29:16.256
I'm okay with that.

29:16.757 --> 29:18.800
- Come on, Leo.
- No, no, no, no, no.

29:18.884 --> 29:20.219
Sean, no. Sean, please.

29:21.011 --> 29:22.804
Come here. All right. Come on.

29:22.888 --> 29:23.972
- Get up, you.
- Leo!

29:24.056 --> 29:25.349
Leo, I'm sorry.

29:28.560 --> 29:29.937
Get down.

29:31.063 --> 29:32.814
Eddie! Eddie.

29:32.898 --> 29:34.983
Shit. Oh, shit.

29:35.067 --> 29:37.569
He needs a hospital.
Tara, give me the phone.

29:37.653 --> 29:39.238
No, Aadesh, we can't. We can't.

29:39.321 --> 29:41.698
- Because he's police?
- No, because we can't stay here.

29:41.782 --> 29:42.991
We can't leave him either.

29:43.075 --> 29:45.410
They'll arrest us as kidnappers,
then Sean kills Leo!

29:45.494 --> 29:47.788
- Natalie, he knows the truth!
- Yes, and he might die!

29:47.871 --> 29:49.790
Exactly! Exactly.

29:50.541 --> 29:51.959
Fucking asshole!

29:53.293 --> 29:54.628
Something's happening.

29:55.546 --> 29:58.590
Ms. Newman? Can you hear me, Ms. Newman?

30:00.801 --> 30:02.803
How are you holding up, Ms. Newman?

30:02.886 --> 30:04.221
I'm sorry, but--

30:06.640 --> 30:08.225
I need to speak.

30:10.018 --> 30:12.646
- Can I speak?
- Okay, sure.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.857
Go ahead. You're live on air.

30:16.900 --> 30:20.821
First,
I need to talk about Eric Cresswell.

30:23.156 --> 30:27.870
As you may now know,
more than 25 years ago,

30:28.412 --> 30:33.250
Professor Cresswell's skill,
integrity and hard work

30:33.333 --> 30:37.588
yielded results
that could've had many consequences.

30:38.839 --> 30:43.969
Including costing
my company's client, IOP,

30:44.052 --> 30:48.432
and, indeed, the entire sector,
a huge amount of money.

30:50.601 --> 30:52.144
I can't speak to what they did.

30:53.687 --> 31:00.444
But at CNPR, we created
an entire strategy of disinformation

31:00.527 --> 31:03.906
in order to protect
our clients' interests.

31:05.282 --> 31:09.036
We commissioned rival reports
from lesser scientists,

31:09.119 --> 31:12.497
built a whole community
of highly visible experts,

31:12.581 --> 31:15.626
all of whom had only one brief:

31:16.376 --> 31:20.506
to emphasize the uncertainty
around climate change.

31:22.424 --> 31:27.095
At the same time,
in order to minimize damage

31:27.179 --> 31:31.141
in the case that Professor Cresswell's
report reached the public domain,

31:32.518 --> 31:34.811
we tried to discredit him as a source.

31:35.979 --> 31:37.773
We did that by building a suggestion

31:37.856 --> 31:40.692
he had inappropriate relationships
with young women.

31:41.318 --> 31:46.156
That wasn't emphasizing the uncertainty.
That was a lie.

31:47.491 --> 31:52.412
Mr. Cresswell did nothing wrong,
professionally or personally.

31:53.705 --> 31:56.625
We did. I did.

31:56.708 --> 31:58.460
She's doing it.

31:59.503 --> 32:01.046
She's actually doing it.

32:01.129 --> 32:03.799
Ms. Newman, that's quite an admission.

32:03.882 --> 32:05.259
I'm not done.

32:08.095 --> 32:10.556
The worst of it, I realize now,

32:11.974 --> 32:15.060
is that when we undermined
Professor Cresswell,

32:15.143 --> 32:18.480
we undermined science itself.

32:18.564 --> 32:20.566
And the repercussions of that

32:20.649 --> 32:24.695
may be as damaging
and far-reaching as climate change.

32:24.778 --> 32:27.906
Because we undermined the facts.

32:27.990 --> 32:32.119
We created doubt when there was none

32:32.202 --> 32:37.165
and helped bring about a culture
where nobody trusts anything.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.459
Even their own eyes.

32:39.960 --> 32:44.131
Because one person's fact
is just as true as anyone else's,

32:44.214 --> 32:46.425
and there's no such thing as a lie.

32:47.718 --> 32:54.391
The truth is that
that's maybe the biggest lie of all.

32:54.474 --> 33:00.022
I'm telling you, the only chance
any of us have got is to tell the truth.

33:00.105 --> 33:04.151
We didn't only help
make people doubt the truth.

33:04.902 --> 33:07.738
We helped make them doubt it even existed.

33:08.322 --> 33:10.365
One of the things Leo learned from her.

33:11.366 --> 33:13.619
People want stories, not facts.

33:14.286 --> 33:20.751
And you… we… are the best story.

33:21.502 --> 33:25.547
And for that, as much as anything else…

33:28.050 --> 33:31.512
I am truly, truly sorry.

33:33.096 --> 33:36.975
People want the three of us
to be the kidnappers. And Sean.

33:37.059 --> 33:42.648
They-- They want to believe in
what they think we did.

33:43.941 --> 33:45.400
So why not let them?

33:47.569 --> 33:50.197
The fact that I didn't know at the time

33:50.280 --> 33:52.991
that these things were happening
in my company,

33:53.075 --> 33:54.701
it's no excuse.

33:55.744 --> 34:01.083
The fact is, it is my company
and, therefore, my responsibility.

34:01.166 --> 34:03.627
We're the only ones
who know what really happened.

34:04.461 --> 34:07.714
Nobody's gonna believe Sean,
and the kids won't say anything.

34:07.798 --> 34:09.925
- And if Leo is--
- You're insane.

34:10.007 --> 34:12.261
And you're going to jail
for a very long time.

34:14.388 --> 34:16.764
Are we really gonna let this all
be for nothing?

34:21.143 --> 34:23.605
I have learned a lot in the past week.

34:25.482 --> 34:29.610
This experience has made me realize
that I got a lot of things badly wrong,

34:29.695 --> 34:32.489
both as a businesswoman and as a mother.

34:34.783 --> 34:37.703
- And I want a chance to go on learning.
- Aadesh.

34:39.079 --> 34:41.623
I can see how much you want
to make something of your life.

34:43.041 --> 34:46.170
Well, this is it!
And I think you feel that.

34:47.713 --> 34:48.880
You should go.

34:49.755 --> 34:51.300
You should go.

34:51.382 --> 34:52.426
Eddie.

34:54.344 --> 34:56.554
Are you alive? Oh, God.

34:57.931 --> 35:00.684
You need to go now,
out the way Sean came in.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.102
I'm not leaving you.

35:02.186 --> 35:04.271
I get it. I'm with you.

35:06.940 --> 35:08.275
We do know each other.

35:13.739 --> 35:14.948
Now!

35:17.951 --> 35:19.328
Active shooter!

35:20.162 --> 35:22.748
NCA officer! Stay back!

35:26.418 --> 35:27.544
Go, go!

35:29.588 --> 35:31.423
- Face down!
- I'm NCA! I'm NCA!

35:31.507 --> 35:33.008
Keep your hands where they are!

35:33.091 --> 35:34.593
Stay where you are.

35:35.719 --> 35:37.513
- Look at me!
- I'm looking.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.519
The world has changed,

35:44.603 --> 35:46.688
and CNPR will change with it.

35:46.772 --> 35:51.068
If we don't, we will die,
and we will deserve to.

35:51.151 --> 35:52.486
Ms. Newman?

35:53.820 --> 35:56.782
- They found Leo, Ms. Newman.
- What?

35:56.865 --> 35:58.033
He's alive.

35:59.952 --> 36:01.203
Is he--

36:02.329 --> 36:04.748
In an underground parking lot
near Times Square.

36:06.124 --> 36:07.167
Thank God.

36:13.799 --> 36:15.217
Okay. You're all good.

36:51.253 --> 36:56.633
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

36:59.720 --> 37:03.849
Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

37:20.157 --> 37:21.241
I got a visual.

37:21.325 --> 37:23.660
Suspect spotted.
How do you want me to proceed?

37:27.497 --> 37:28.707
Go!

37:44.389 --> 37:45.390
Stand still.

38:01.490 --> 38:02.491
Hey!

38:15.420 --> 38:17.673
I heard you're lucky to be alive.

38:18.632 --> 38:19.758
Did they find them?

38:19.842 --> 38:22.344
So far, only Natalie.

38:23.595 --> 38:26.640
Hey. It's not your fault, okay?

38:27.391 --> 38:28.684
You did everything you could.

38:30.477 --> 38:32.104
I'm proud of you.

38:32.187 --> 38:34.898
And you're safe. You and Leo.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.608
Yeah.

38:37.860 --> 38:38.902
We did it.

38:41.154 --> 38:42.239
Talk to you soon.

38:44.324 --> 38:45.409
Hey.

38:45.492 --> 38:47.661
I wanted to thank you for everything.

38:47.744 --> 38:48.871
Well, thank you.

38:49.955 --> 38:51.039
Did you see him yet?

38:51.123 --> 38:52.332
About to.

38:52.833 --> 38:55.335
Have you told your daughter
you're coming home?

38:55.419 --> 38:56.461
About to.

39:10.350 --> 39:11.435
Professor?

39:16.899 --> 39:18.650
- Hi, Granddad.
- Daisy.

39:19.526 --> 39:20.652
It's nice to meet you.

39:50.015 --> 39:51.099
Leo.

39:52.100 --> 39:53.101
Mom.

39:54.478 --> 39:55.479
Hi.

40:03.946 --> 40:06.114
Leo. Leo.

40:08.784 --> 40:11.203
It's hard to believe it's real, isn't it?

40:22.798 --> 40:28.053
One thing you still have to learn,
hiding the truth is easy.

40:29.263 --> 40:31.473
Escaping it is…

40:33.600 --> 40:35.310
Nobody can look away now.

40:36.979 --> 40:37.980
We'll see.
