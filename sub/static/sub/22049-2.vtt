00:02.820 --> 00:06.780
If you think I look at you like a trophy,
you're wrong. You're not good enough.

00:06.820 --> 00:09.980
Vilde, you're super pretty.
-But not pretty enough.

00:09.980 --> 00:12.460
If you really want to get rid of me,
go on a date with me.

00:12.460 --> 00:15.720
Remember when I said you weren't good enough?
That was bullshit.

00:16.160 --> 00:16.980
Okay.

00:17.300 --> 00:21.540
Why is it so hard to understand that people
can be friends with their ex?

00:22.260 --> 00:24.920
It's William.
He wants to talk to you.

00:24.980 --> 00:30.360
If you go out on a date with me,
I'll stop using Vilde.

00:52.200 --> 00:55.600
Hi. Hello.
-Hi?

00:57.360 --> 01:00.740
We were wondering if you know Jonas.
From the first year.

01:00.740 --> 01:02.740
I think he's in 1STD.

01:03.560 --> 01:07.220
Eh, yeah...
-Do you know if he's together with someone?

01:08.880 --> 01:10.900
No, I don't think so.

01:11.020 --> 01:14.780
What about the girl with the Head jacket?

01:15.020 --> 01:18.000
Eh, Eva?
-Yes, Eva!

01:18.080 --> 01:19.980
No, she's not his girlfriend.

01:20.880 --> 01:23.440
Okay, great. Thanks!

01:35.700 --> 01:37.220
Hello.
-Hi!

01:39.920 --> 01:41.180
What's up?

01:42.320 --> 01:44.100
I didn't do my homework.

01:50.140 --> 01:52.420
Have you talked to Jonas?

01:52.420 --> 01:54.240
Yeah, why?

01:56.480 --> 01:59.540
What actually happened on Friday?

02:01.640 --> 02:03.340
His phone died.

02:05.460 --> 02:11.280
So... Did he have fun at
the Elvebakken party?

02:11.280 --> 02:16.980
They never even got there. They went to a
third year party. Do you know whose?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.780
Apparently it was really awesome.
Lots of people from school were there.

02:21.780 --> 02:24.080
We should've known and gone there.

02:25.620 --> 02:27.660
Did he hook up with someone?

02:29.840 --> 02:32.700
I don't think so. Don't know. Why?

02:34.200 --> 02:39.380
It seems like the only thing you two talk about
is who he has hooked up with.

02:39.700 --> 02:45.500
That's not the only thing we talk about!
Also about who I hook up with.

02:47.280 --> 02:50.700
You haven't hooked up with anyone since
you've broken up, have you?

02:51.680 --> 02:55.740
But if I had...
-Maybe you should.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.980
Hook up with someone?
-Hm-hm.

02:59.520 --> 03:03.780
I'd gladly hook up with someone,
but I just haven't hit on anyone.

03:04.320 --> 03:06.940
What about Tinder?
-Tinder?!

03:06.940 --> 03:09.620
Okay... what happened to you?

03:09.620 --> 03:15.420
I think it'd be good for you to get out
there a little.

03:17.820 --> 03:20.980
I'm not on Tinder.
-Why not?

03:20.980 --> 03:24.600
Are you on Tinder?
-Me? No. Oh my god.

03:26.240 --> 03:31.820
But you, Noora... Why don't we ever talk
about your love life?

03:31.820 --> 03:35.860
We have Spanish now. Clock is ticking,
and you haven't done your homework.

03:36.120 --> 03:38.340
(Why are you changing the subject?)

03:38.840 --> 03:40.740
Who did you hook up with last?

03:40.780 --> 03:45.020
I'm just saying we have Spanish now.
Stop talking about hooking up.

03:45.040 --> 03:52.040
It's the only thing you care about.
I've never heard you talk about anything else.

03:52.100 --> 03:53.600
It's really sick.

03:54.840 --> 03:57.000
Maybe you should get some help.

03:57.240 --> 04:00.260
With Spanish or hooking up?
-Both!

04:10.100 --> 04:12.900
Should we just be wallflowers then?

04:13.000 --> 04:18.360
It's not about being wallflowers.
It's about how we present ourselves.

04:18.400 --> 04:21.820
We shouldn't be perceived as
sexual objects.

04:21.940 --> 04:25.680
I don't want to be a sexual object,
I just want us to look pretty.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.840
You use red lipstick.
Because it looks pretty on you.

04:28.880 --> 04:32.160
That's not why I do it.
It's because I think it's nice.

04:32.160 --> 04:34.920
I don't do it for guys.
-What's the difference?

04:35.900 --> 04:39.560
<i>[You're really pretty today. Happy Women's Day.
Looking forward to Friday.]</i>

04:39.640 --> 04:42.320
It's going well. We got "Brun og Blid"
as a sponsor.

04:42.320 --> 04:49.640
How did you do that?
-I've been doing a little research after school.

04:51.580 --> 04:54.860
I'm not really sure if we should have them
as our sponsor.

04:54.860 --> 05:00.480
Because I don't think I want us to present
ourselves as sexual objects.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.080
That's really important to me.

05:02.240 --> 05:09.700
But at the same time I want us to be seen
as beautiful individuals.

05:10.140 --> 05:14.400
Above all we will emphasize
our femininity.

05:14.640 --> 05:17.460
I think that "Brun og Blid" is
good for that.

05:31.180 --> 05:34.720
Why is everyone staring at Jonas?
-Didn't you hear?

05:36.740 --> 05:37.540
No.

05:39.380 --> 05:42.480
There are rumors that he got
a third year to come.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.260
Come to what?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.260
Cum-come..

05:51.100 --> 05:53.960
He slept with a third year?

05:54.640 --> 05:56.980
He went down on her.

05:58.880 --> 06:02.300
Huh?
-He licked her.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.580
But Eva, you said Norwegian guys didn't...

06:16.420 --> 06:17.520
Hello.

06:20.460 --> 06:22.080
Happy Women's Day.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.180
What course do you guys have now?
-Eh, Norwegian! Yeah.

06:38.840 --> 06:42.860
Me too. Should we just go now?

06:56.340 --> 07:01.040
It's difficult for Tinder to know that.
It should be in the bio. 14 centimeter.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.400
Hey you! Look who's on Tinder.

07:05.600 --> 07:10.040
Tinder?
-Yes, Tinder! You have to come with me.

07:10.400 --> 07:12.040
Why should I come with?

07:12.140 --> 07:16.260
Excuse me? Check his friends.
They are fucking handsome.

07:16.260 --> 07:18.140
They are second years at Handels.

07:20.340 --> 07:25.840
His name is Adam. Adam... Eva...
It's perfect!

07:25.980 --> 07:28.980
Then you can go with her!
-I'm going to Stavanger.

07:30.300 --> 07:32.040
You?
-I have basketball camp.

07:32.100 --> 07:34.440
It's my cousin's birthday.

07:34.440 --> 07:37.360
Noora! Come with me, please?

07:37.440 --> 07:40.300
You said I needed to
meet more guys.

07:40.540 --> 07:46.760
I can't though. Sorry.
-You can't, really?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.900
Hey, Noora?

07:56.680 --> 08:01.760
I'll just ask you straight out.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.700
Are you a lesbian?

08:11.320 --> 08:14.580
There's nothing wrong with being a lesbian.
-No, no no no!

08:14.580 --> 08:15.540
Vilde...

08:15.940 --> 08:22.400
It's not weird that I think so! You don't have sex
and you don't want to talk about sex.

08:23.320 --> 08:27.820
Just because I don't go around talking about
being keen on having sex...

08:28.340 --> 08:30.320
... doesn't mean I'm a lesbian.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.200
But what are you doing tomorrow?

08:36.220 --> 08:40.600
It's Eskild's birthday.

08:41.120 --> 08:46.380
Is he having a big party?
-No. A small celebration.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.380
Not even a real celebration. Just...

08:53.240 --> 09:00.440
Maybe we can meet up later
if you're going out?

09:48.480 --> 09:51.840
Who was that?
-Her name is Jamila Bikarim.

09:51.940 --> 09:53.300
Do you know each other?

09:53.640 --> 09:56.640
She's engaged to my brother.
-Engaged?!

09:56.640 --> 09:59.300
How old is she?
-She's 17.

10:02.580 --> 10:06.380
Is it an arranged marriage?
-Huh?

10:07.360 --> 10:10.340
Why would you get married when you're 17?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.580
Because they want to have sex.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.580
That is great.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.760
Hello.

11:32.340 --> 11:35.000
You're so pretty. Where are you going?
-I'm not pretty.

11:36.000 --> 11:36.980
Okay...

11:37.120 --> 11:40.080
I got a Facebook message
from Eva. Your friend.

11:40.580 --> 11:44.860
She wrote: Happy birthday!

11:45.360 --> 11:49.680
You didn't say that it wasn't your birthday?
-Huh? Not yet.

11:49.900 --> 11:55.500
You can't say that. I had to say it was your
birthday because I have a date.

11:55.880 --> 12:00.200
You have a date? With who?
-An asshole called William.

12:00.600 --> 12:05.680
William? As in Vilde's William?

12:05.680 --> 12:09.920
He's not Vilde's William.
-Okay. Drama.

12:09.920 --> 12:17.460
He really isn't Vilde's. And you wanna know something?
I'm doing this for Vilde's sake.

12:18.040 --> 12:22.940
You're going on a date with William for Vilde's sake?
-Yep.

12:23.080 --> 12:24.920
Okay, how is that related?

12:27.540 --> 12:31.020
He told Vilde she wasn't good enough.

12:31.080 --> 12:37.720
I have to go on a date with him,
to get him to apologise to Vilde.

12:38.660 --> 12:44.440
So you're not going on a date with William because
you want to, but to not hurt Vilde?

12:44.460 --> 12:45.200
Yes!

12:46.700 --> 12:52.460
She won't be hurt when she finds out you're
dating him behind her back?

12:52.700 --> 12:57.080
<i>[Outside.]</i>

12:57.920 --> 13:02.700
I'm not dating William. I'm going on one
date to get rid of him.

13:02.700 --> 13:06.700
And anyway, she'll never find
out about it.

13:07.320 --> 13:14.040
Because you won't tell Eva that it's
not your birthday, okay?

13:58.520 --> 14:02.080
Hi.
-Hi.

14:04.460 --> 14:05.920
Are you ready?

14:07.620 --> 14:09.600
Ready for what?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.500
Are you coming out,
or are you just going to sit here?

15:49.680 --> 15:52.280
Really cool to just sit there
and be pissed.

17:05.300 --> 17:06.560
Cocoa?

17:22.760 --> 17:24.840
Do you see that church down there?

17:27.900 --> 17:30.840
My grandparents lived to the right of it,

17:32.380 --> 17:35.080
in a really big and creepy house.

17:36.200 --> 17:41.340
They had paintings on every wall possible.

17:42.320 --> 17:47.600
My brother said the paintings came alive
and walked around at night.

17:48.800 --> 17:51.520
There was just one room that I liked, the TV room.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.420
Grandma called it the Blue Room.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.020
Walls were blue.
Chairs were blue.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.420
Pillows were blue.
Vases were blue.

18:08.480 --> 18:14.040
You know the wall-to-wall carpet?
Where the carpet covers the entire floor?

18:14.420 --> 18:17.220
Yes, I know what wall-to-wall carpet is.

18:18.620 --> 18:20.280
That was blue, too.

18:27.240 --> 18:29.340
You're fucking with me, or what?

18:30.420 --> 18:32.300
Hm? What?

18:32.720 --> 18:35.040
Do you think I fall for that stuff?

18:35.720 --> 18:36.720
What?

18:38.700 --> 18:40.320
Everything here.

18:41.040 --> 18:48.180
With the view, cocoa, carpet, and then you
come with that damn childhood story.

18:49.840 --> 18:56.840
Did you see it in some high school movie
and took note of it, or?

18:56.840 --> 18:57.960
Wow...

19:01.660 --> 19:03.340
You're really cold.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.260
I mean it.

19:06.520 --> 19:08.080
Okay...

19:10.160 --> 19:12.600
I won't talk about my childhood
stories anymore.

19:14.380 --> 19:15.880
What do you want to talk about?

19:17.380 --> 19:19.980
I don't want to talk about anything.

19:20.780 --> 19:23.080
I don't want to get to know you.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.640
I don't even want to be here.

19:25.640 --> 19:27.200
Why are you here then?

19:27.720 --> 19:29.440
Because you pressured me.

19:29.960 --> 19:31.700
I actually didn't pressure you.

19:32.740 --> 19:34.900
How did I pressure you?

19:37.040 --> 19:43.160
Because you sent Vilde messages and you called her,
just to get to me.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.080
How is that pressuring someone?

19:46.400 --> 19:49.680
Because she shouldn't think there's
something between us.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.240
You're not just saying that?
That there's nothing between us.

19:55.680 --> 20:00.000
You're twisting it. It's much more
complicated than that.

20:01.360 --> 20:05.740
It's not that complicated.
You're lying to a friend and you blame me.

20:16.060 --> 20:20.660
The point is that I'm not
interested in you.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.660
And I never will be.

20:23.580 --> 20:25.060
Why not?

20:25.500 --> 20:30.060
You're controlling,
and selfish.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.900
And you use people to get your way.

20:37.000 --> 20:41.300
You're cold,
and selfish...

20:41.520 --> 20:43.100
You already said selfish.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.760
And that time in the school yard when you
said Vilde wasn't good enough.

20:48.460 --> 20:50.600
How can you say something like that?

20:53.500 --> 20:55.620
I didn't want her to like me.

20:56.180 --> 20:59.800
Couldn't you have said it in a better way?

20:59.940 --> 21:04.280
Why should I have said that in a better way?
-To not hurt her.

21:04.940 --> 21:06.420
Hurt her?

21:08.460 --> 21:10.600
There's no point in not hurting her...

21:13.060 --> 21:20.500
... when I don't want her to like me. It's better to be clear
so there won't be any doubt.

21:21.300 --> 21:24.000
And destroy her self-image?

21:24.220 --> 21:27.360
Do you really think that's how it works?
-What?

21:28.320 --> 21:31.900
It's not possible to destroy her self-image with one comment.

21:35.020 --> 21:38.700
In that case, I think her self-image had already
been destroyed before that.

21:47.620 --> 21:53.120
But if you saw it from my side...
It was Vilde who came to me.

21:53.560 --> 21:56.880
She was keen on me.
She wanted to sleep with me.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.880
I didn't promise her anything.

22:05.580 --> 22:09.480
However, you called me out in the
middle of the school yard.

22:10.020 --> 22:14.200
Does that make you good?
Does that make you fair?

22:44.280 --> 22:47.180
Shouldn't you have warm cocao?
-No.

22:49.740 --> 22:51.320
I like the cold.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.720
Then it tastes like chocolate milk.

23:11.200 --> 23:19.920
It's good that you apologised about telling Vilde
she's not good enough.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.480
Is it?
-Hm-hm.

23:24.880 --> 23:26.340
Okay.

23:31.260 --> 23:36.280
I hope it was a smart plan,
because now she likes me again.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.660
I don't like her.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.340
So then we'll end up in the same place,
won't we?

24:02.640 --> 24:03.660
Hello?

24:08.240 --> 24:09.340
Where?

24:13.080 --> 24:14.280
Where are you?

24:18.200 --> 24:19.520
We have to go.

24:20.920 --> 24:24.740
What's up?
-I'll drive you home.

24:35.000 --> 24:40.660
But just so that we're clear,
so that there won't be any misunderstandings.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.840
I've made up for it now.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.520
I don't owe you anything.

24:49.220 --> 24:51.180
No, you don't owe me anything.
