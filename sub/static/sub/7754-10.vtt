If you want to be real, then you
have to have proper emotions.

Ohhhh...
Yep.

14:38.278 --> 14:42.380
[ Bird cries ]
>> Darwin: So, where do we go
now?

14:42.382 --> 14:47.151
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]
I don't know, dude.
I'm no survivor.

14:47.153 --> 14:51.222
I'm just useless.
>> Darwin: But we're still
alive.

14:51.224 --> 14:55.793
Hungry, cold, and lost...
But alive!
And we're still a team.

14:55.795 --> 14:59.530
I know you can get us out of
here.
Let's have lunch.

14:59.532 --> 15:04.702
You'll feel better.
Fish flakes or<i> diet</i> fish flakes?
>> Gumball: You're right, buddy!

15:04.704 --> 15:09.807
I<i> am</i> a survivor, and i<i> will</i> get
us to the picnic!
>> Darwin: Can i have the diet

15:09.809 --> 15:12.477
fish flakes?
>> Gumball: You don't want to
eat that.

15:12.479 --> 15:16.581
[ Crash! ]
Not when you're in the middle of
nature's supermarket.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.451
>> Darwin: What?
>> Gumball: [ Sighs ]
Look at this tree, Darwin.

15:20.453 --> 15:25.790
It's made from little bits,
which themselves are made from
the smallest bits of all --

15:25.792 --> 15:29.727
circles, circles with other
little circles going around
them.

15:29.729 --> 15:36.968
So, since everything is made
from circles, then so is food.
Which means this rock is exactly

15:36.970 --> 15:41.773
the same as a chicken nugget.
So let's eat it!
[ Crunch! ]

15:41.775 --> 15:45.209
[ Sighs ]
>> Darwin: Circle nugget tastes
like a rock.

15:45.211 --> 15:49.180
>> Gumball: don't worry, dude.
There's loads of stuff made of
circles.

15:49.182 --> 15:53.618
That's why it's called the
circle of life.
>> Darwin: Oh.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.586
Is that made of circles, too?

15:59.458 --> 16:02.126
>> Gumball: Even better than
circles.
It's made of meat!

16:02.128 --> 16:05.430
>> Darwin: But we don't have a
weapon.
>> Gumball: Hmm...

16:05.432 --> 16:08.199
Hang on, Darwin.
I don't need weapons.
I got claws.

16:08.201 --> 16:12.704
[ Evilly ] I am a predator.
Hear me roar!
Meow!

16:12.706 --> 16:16.274
[ Normal voice ] Let's sneak up
on him.
[ Purrs ]

16:16.276 --> 16:18.242
>> Darwin: [ Growls ]

16:22.715 --> 16:26.417
Uh, gumball?
>> Gumball: Shh!
>> Darwin: I haven't got claws.

16:26.419 --> 16:31.456
>> Gumball: Shh!
>> Darwin: But i got fins.
I could fish-slap the beautiful

16:31.458 --> 16:33.891
creature.
>> Gumball: Shhhh!
Dude!

16:33.893 --> 16:39.931
We're trying to sneak up on it!
[ Honk! ]
[ Flies buzzing ]

16:39.933 --> 16:45.703
>> Darwin: Come on! Get him!
>> Gumball: Uh...You first.
>> Darwin: Okay.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.207
[ Slap! ]
[ Creak! ]
Can we eat it now?

16:52.945 --> 16:55.513
>> Gumball: Whoops!
[ Chuckles nervously ]
[ Pitter! Pitter! Pitter! ]

16:55.515 --> 16:57.548
>> [ Growls ]
>> Gumball: [ Panting ]

16:57.550 --> 17:00.284
Maybe we should try something
smaller.

17:02.021 --> 17:06.958
>> Darwin: Why are we smiling?
Gumball, please, please don't
eat it!

17:06.960 --> 17:09.927
>> Gumball: It's him or us,
dude.
We got to eat<i> something.</i>

17:09.929 --> 17:15.433
>> Darwin: But look at him!
He's so cute!
>> [ Whimpers ]

17:20.205 --> 17:24.375
>> Gumball: What was i
thinking?!
I'm sorry, little dude.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.578
Bye-bye!
Cherish your freedom!
>> Darwin: Never abandon your

17:27.580 --> 17:30.281
dreams!
>> Gumball: And have a beautiful
life!

17:30.283 --> 17:36.320
>> [ Cawing ]
[ Whap! ]
>> [ Growls ]

17:36.322 --> 17:42.860
[ Munching ]
>> [ Roars ]
Blblblblblblblblblblbl!

17:42.862 --> 17:47.965
[ Glug! Glug! ]
[ Slurps ]
[ Gasps ]

17:47.967 --> 17:54.072
[ Munch! Munch! Munch! ]
>> Darwin: That was horrible.
>> Gumball: Well, it's nature's

17:54.074 --> 17:56.674
way, Darwin.
He was at the bottom of the food
chain.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.812
>> Darwin: Who's at the bottom
<i>now?</i>
>> [ Growls ]

18:00.814 --> 18:05.516
[ Zip! ]
[ Both panting ]
>> Gumball: I think he's gone.

18:05.518 --> 18:10.254
>> [ Growling ]
>> Gumball: What was that?
>> Darwin: It's my tummy.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.391
>> Gumball: Well, stop it!
You're gonna attract another
predator!

18:13.393 --> 18:16.961
>> Darwin: But I'm hungry.
>> Gumball: Oh, will you<i> please</i>
stop talking about food?

18:16.963 --> 18:21.365
>> Darwin: Okay.
I'm cold.
>> Gumball: Ugh!

18:21.367 --> 18:27.338
Fine. Let's make a fire.
[ Squeaking ]
>> Darwin: Faster!

18:27.340 --> 18:30.575
Faster!
Faster!
>> Gumball: Ugh!

18:30.577 --> 18:35.413
It's useless!
Never gonna work!
Aaaaaaah!

18:35.415 --> 18:37.381
[ Screaming ]

18:39.918 --> 18:47.592
[ Crying ]
>> Darwin: Gumball, it worked!
>> Gumball: Of course it did.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.461
I told you i was a born
survivor.
Good work, team.

18:50.463 --> 18:56.134
>> Darwin: High five!
[ Thunder crashes ]
[ Both sigh ]

19:01.473 --> 19:08.846
[ Stomach growling ]
I'm really hungry.
>> Gumball: Yeah, me too.

19:08.848 --> 19:14.385
>> Anyone for a fourth helping?
>> I'll have it!
Oops! I split myself!

19:14.387 --> 19:19.991
[ Laughs ]
[ Stomach growling ]
>> Gumball: Ohhh, I'm so hungry!

19:19.993 --> 19:24.529
I think I've started to digest
myself.
And there's no food around here

19:24.531 --> 19:28.933
for miles!
>> Darwin: [ Evilly ] Oh, yes,
there is.

19:28.935 --> 19:34.939
>> Gumball: What?
[ Echoing ] Aaaaaaaaah!
>> Darwin: Yum!

19:34.941 --> 19:38.276
>> Gumball: What is wrong with
you?!
You ate all my clothes!

19:38.278 --> 19:41.913
>> Darwin: Well, maybe you
shouldn't have thrown away my
lunch box.

19:41.915 --> 19:45.650
>> Gumball: Yeah, i know.
I'm sorry.
>> Darwin: You wouldn't be naked

19:45.652 --> 19:48.853
if i had my lunch box.
>> Gumball: Yeah, yeah, i get
it.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.490
>> Darwin: I sure wish i had my
lunch box.
>> Gumball: [ Mockingly ] Oh,

19:52.492 --> 19:56.494
lunch box, lunch box, lunch box!
Aw, you just don't get it, do
you?!

19:56.496 --> 20:00.631
<i>You're</i> holding me back!
You're on your own!
See you later, buddy!

20:00.633 --> 20:04.268
You can find your own way to the
picnic!
>> Darwin: But...I thought we

20:04.270 --> 20:07.104
were a team.
>> Gumball: I don't need anyone
on my team!

20:07.106 --> 20:11.909
I am a born survivor!
Aaah!
Whoo! Aah! Ow!

20:11.911 --> 20:18.249
Agh! Unh! Unh! Aah!
Aaaaaah!
[ Peel! ]

20:18.251 --> 20:22.753
[ Strained ] See? I survived.
>> [ Growls ]
>> Gumball: Huh?

20:22.755 --> 20:28.826
>> [ Growling ]
>> Gumball: Huh?!
[ Whimpering ]

20:28.828 --> 20:35.032
>> [ Growling ]
>> [ Growls ]
>> [ Growls ]

20:35.034 --> 20:38.469
>> Gumball: Somebody, please
help me!

20:41.340 --> 20:48.079
>> Darwin: [ Deep voice ] Nobody
messes with my team!
[ All chuckle ]

20:48.081 --> 20:52.950
[ All growl ]
don't make me hurt you!
>> Gumball: Darwin, what are you

20:52.952 --> 20:57.555
doing?!
>> [ Growling ]
Hmm?

20:57.557 --> 21:03.861
[ Whimpers ]
>> Darwin: Bad! Bad predator!
>> [ Crying ]

21:03.863 --> 21:10.501
>> Darwin: And there's plenty
more where that came from.
>> [ Gasps ]

21:10.503 --> 21:14.472
>> Gumball: You -- you came back
to save me?
>> Darwin: [ Normal voice ] Of

21:14.474 --> 21:17.675
course.
We're a team, remember?
>> Gumball: I'm sorry i was such

21:17.677 --> 21:24.715
a jerk to you before.
I guess i was really hungry and
cold and...Naked.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.019
>> Darwin: Maybe you shouldn't
have thrown away my lunch box.
>> Gumball: I know.

21:28.021 --> 21:30.855
>> Darwin: And swallowed the
map.
>> Gumball: Yeah, sorry.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.592
>> Darwin: And got us lost.
>> Gumball: Yeah.
>> Darwin: And made me chew on a

21:34.594 --> 21:37.695
rock.
>> Gumball: All right!
I said i was sorry!

21:37.697 --> 21:44.168
So...Still friends?
>> Darwin: Of course!
[ Both sigh ]

21:44.170 --> 21:47.271
>> Gumball: Cool, 'cause i
twisted my ankle, so you're
gonna have to carry me to the

21:47.273 --> 21:49.240
picnic area.

21:50.976 --> 21:55.146
>> All: Ew!
>> Gumball: Look, Darwin --
food!

21:55.148 --> 22:00.885
[ Munch! Munch! Munch! ]
>> Miss simian, gumball's eating
from the trash can!

22:00.887 --> 22:05.222
And he's naked.
>> don't care!
Everybody, back to the bus!

22:05.224 --> 22:11.195
Go along the path, avoiding the
forest of doom and the ravine,
avoiding the forest...

22:11.197 --> 22:14.965
>> Gumball: That was so good!
[ Birds chirping ]
>> Darwin: Huh?!

22:14.967 --> 22:19.870
>> Gumball: They're gone!
>> Darwin: Did she say "avoid"
or "go through" the forest of

22:19.872 --> 22:20.971
doom?
