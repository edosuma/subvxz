<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:05.606 --> 00:07.339
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:07.341 --> 00:08.774
<i> and the district attorneys</i>

00:08.776 --> 00:10.209

00:10.211 --> 00:11.477
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:15.516 --> 00:17.316
Paul.

00:17.318 --> 00:19.284
I had your office
try you at home this morning.

00:19.286 --> 00:21.487
You're still asking
for a severance?

00:21.489 --> 00:23.155
Yeah, well, almost not,

00:23.157 --> 00:25.090
given the threats
my client received this weekend.

00:25.092 --> 00:26.492
Diane, we prepped
him for this.

00:26.494 --> 00:28.360
He wavers now, we're
right back where we started.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.862
Come on, he's a kid.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.363
Just the sight of these two
will be enough to freeze him.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.431
That's their right.

00:32.433 --> 00:34.450
To intimidate him?

00:34.451 --> 00:36.468
We requested separate
transport vans.

00:36.470 --> 00:40.239
Hopefully this thing
will be short and sweet.

00:55.523 --> 00:59.358
BAILIFF:
Docket #9357.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.095
Motion to sever defendant
Ryan M. Cutrona

01:03.097 --> 01:06.532
from co-defendants
Howard S. Metzler

01:06.534 --> 01:10.102
and Steven B. Hanauer.

01:10.104 --> 01:12.671
Why is there a motion to sever
in a gang rape case now?

01:12.673 --> 01:15.641
I'd like to get this trial
started, people.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.376
The more motions filed
on this case,

01:17.378 --> 01:20.279
the more press attention
it seems to get.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.680
Your Honor, due to what we feel
may be an overwhelming

01:21.682 --> 01:23.682
amount of evidence
against his co-defendants...

01:23.684 --> 01:25.250
What evidence?

01:25.252 --> 01:27.152
He's lying.
He's got nothing.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.554
He wants to save
his own ass.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.588
(<i> gavel banging</i> )
Order.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.323
Don't be stupid, okay?

01:31.325 --> 01:32.591
Don't be dead.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.326
(<i> gavel bangs</i> )
Order.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.561
We know what you did.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.429
Counsel?
You hear me, Ryan?

01:37.431 --> 01:39.565
I'll have your client contained.
Do you hear me?

01:39.567 --> 01:43.302
Look at me! Do you
hear me, Cutrona?! Huh?

01:43.304 --> 01:44.804
You hear me?!

01:44.805 --> 01:46.305
I want you to
know exactly...!

01:46.307 --> 01:48.640
Wait, Ryan. Don't...
Walk away!

01:48.642 --> 01:51.110
Walk away!

01:51.712 --> 01:53.278
(<i> woman screams</i> )

01:53.280 --> 01:55.647
(<i> people shouting</i> )

01:59.587 --> 02:02.654
OFFICER:
Face to the floor. Do it!

02:06.660 --> 02:10.729
   Captioning sponsored by
   NBC/UNIVERSAL

03:31.445 --> 03:33.512
Because I can't even get him
to sit in a damn chair,

03:33.514 --> 03:35.414
much less listen to
anything I have to say.

03:35.416 --> 03:37.716
A severance is not going
to do your client much good

03:37.718 --> 03:39.918
if he's facing
the exact same charges.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.286
Oh, for crying...

03:41.288 --> 03:42.854
The kid's terrified.

03:42.856 --> 03:44.423
I offered to lower the charges

03:44.425 --> 03:46.225
if he gave me
pertinent information.

03:46.227 --> 03:47.292
Okay, so where do we stand?

03:47.294 --> 03:48.493
I can prosecute
either way.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.296
with or without him,
but I'd have to guess

03:51.298 --> 03:52.864
from what happened
in court this morning

03:52.866 --> 03:54.399
that he's got something
of value,

03:54.401 --> 03:57.836
and I'd rather have the truth
than not.
Yeah.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.405
So let's set it up,
we'll take a run at him.

04:00.407 --> 04:03.342
LOGAN:
did you follow her for?

04:03.344 --> 04:05.510
A couple blocks.

04:05.512 --> 04:07.479
Did anybody
talk about it

04:07.481 --> 04:09.348
while you
followed her?

04:09.350 --> 04:12.818
We... really didn't think
he'd go through with it.

04:12.820 --> 04:16.388
LOGAN:
Why? You talked about it before?

04:16.390 --> 04:19.491
METZLER:
Yeah. Ryan said he wanted to.

04:19.493 --> 04:22.394
We just thought we'd set him up.

04:22.396 --> 04:24.930
He'd back off... get scared.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.431
That's not true.

04:26.433 --> 04:30.002
LOGAN:
at all? touch Miss De Vries

04:30.004 --> 04:31.737
We're clear
on that issue, Detective,

04:31.739 --> 04:33.872
My client stated
that he only watched.

04:33.874 --> 04:36.808
Did you want
to touch her?

04:36.810 --> 04:40.412
Ryan's the one
who got off.

04:43.917 --> 04:45.450
Hanauer's is worse.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.887
Says you begged them
to help you do someone.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.857
Says they even had
to stop you

04:51.859 --> 04:53.325
during the attack.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.327
I don't want to see it.

04:55.329 --> 04:57.362
It's just more lies.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.531
fill us in?
Why don't you

05:02.469 --> 05:04.036
I can't.

05:04.038 --> 05:05.504
Ryan, whatever
you're holding back

05:05.506 --> 05:07.406
must be damning enough
to scare them.

05:07.408 --> 05:09.541
They're counting on your fear
to protect themselves.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.977
I'll take
a lie detector test

05:11.979 --> 05:14.546
and prove that
I didn't do anything.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.982
That's not enough with
what your buddies
are telling us.

05:16.984 --> 05:21.053
Ryan, you're accused
of raping a woman.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.489
I'm 17.

05:24.491 --> 05:28.060
I don't have a record.

05:28.062 --> 05:30.429
You'll be tried
as an adult

05:30.431 --> 05:32.364
and any jury
that sees those tapes

05:32.366 --> 05:33.899
will send you up

05:33.901 --> 05:36.435
for a lot more time
than your buddies will do.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.943
You know he didn't
run point on this.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.845
I can't prosecute
on instincts.

05:46.847 --> 05:49.047
She had bruises
on her wrists and ankles.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.049
How many hands do you
think my client has?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.452
That's an interesting defense.
You plan to outprosecute me?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.954
Where are you
going to take this?

05:55.956 --> 05:59.024
I can only work with
what I have on hand,

05:59.026 --> 06:02.027
and if your client plans
to martyr himself

06:02.029 --> 06:03.829
with a heavier sentence,
that's not my problem.

06:03.831 --> 06:07.833
I'll go after the others
as hard as I do your client.

06:07.835 --> 06:09.835
DNA tests
on the semen samples

06:09.837 --> 06:11.837
are due in this afternoon.

06:11.839 --> 06:13.905
We'll talk
with you then.

06:15.008 --> 06:17.008
Because it's a game
to these kids, Adam,

06:17.010 --> 06:18.610
and I'm sure they were
the driving force.

06:18.612 --> 06:20.145
The Cutrona kid's
holding something.

06:20.147 --> 06:21.947
I have no idea what it is.

06:21.949 --> 06:25.384
Nothing out of the transcripts
from the victim?

06:25.386 --> 06:27.919
Her recollection has been shaky
at best.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.988
She's pretty much
repressed the whole event.

06:30.924 --> 06:33.692
She's what,
a reporter?

06:33.694 --> 06:34.860
Reporter?

06:34.862 --> 06:36.862
She does exploitive crap.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.431
All sizzle
and no steak.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.099
Where's that
coming from?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.935
I'm sorry, Adam,
but I have to be honest.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.438
I want to put away the scum
that raped her,

06:46.440 --> 06:49.074
but I don't have to embrace
her journalism,

06:49.076 --> 06:51.410
her lifestyle or her attitudes.
I don't like her,

06:51.412 --> 06:53.044
and I don't think a jury
will like her either.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.514
A tough case
without her on the stand.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.450
I wish that were
my only concern.

06:58.452 --> 07:00.986
I feel like we're hitting
baseballs in the dark.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.989
We've got enough with the tapes
and maybe the circumstantial

07:03.991 --> 07:07.526
to put someone away,
probably the wrong kid,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.961
which means that Metzler
and Hanauer's people

07:09.963 --> 07:11.963
will ask to be severed
from the Cutrona kid

07:11.965 --> 07:13.432
because he'll take the fall.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.434
Then they get suspended
or greatly reduced.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.035
Or maybe nothing.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.472
No match on the semen sample.

07:20.474 --> 07:22.341
On any of them?

07:22.342 --> 07:24.209
Oh, that could solve
our entire dilemma.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.177
We may be dead in the water.

07:25.179 --> 07:27.078
Possibly another
assailant.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.080
Never mentioned
by the others.

07:29.082 --> 07:31.583
She was foggy the first
few days on the numbers,

07:31.585 --> 07:33.652
but has since
said it was three.

07:33.654 --> 07:35.086
What about
a boyfriend?

07:35.088 --> 07:36.721
I'll check.

07:39.226 --> 07:41.393
Just a minute.

07:41.394 --> 07:43.561
Did she state whether
there was penetration

07:43.564 --> 07:44.996
during the rape?

07:44.998 --> 07:46.465
She's repressed it.

07:46.467 --> 07:47.966
Rape kit findings
at the hospital

07:47.968 --> 07:49.534
indicate there was.

07:49.536 --> 07:52.003
If there was no discharge
during the rape,

07:52.005 --> 07:55.173
it could be a boyfriend
previous night, that morning.

07:55.175 --> 07:57.108
Well, find out.

07:57.110 --> 08:00.245
Either way, we're hurt
without a DNA match.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.513
All right.

08:02.716 --> 08:04.516
Paul.

08:04.518 --> 08:07.519
We're, uh, thinking
of requisitioning you

08:07.521 --> 08:09.521
a flak jacket
for your birthday.

08:09.523 --> 08:11.022
Yeah. It's all over
the precinct.

08:11.024 --> 08:12.157
Last I heard
you what..?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.525
Single-handedly
disarmed the kid?

08:13.527 --> 08:15.227
Crushed the gun
with his bare hands.

08:15.229 --> 08:16.495
(<i> whistles</i> )

08:24.638 --> 08:26.671
Monica De Vries
have a boyfriend?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.640
Don't know.
Why, are you
in the market?

08:28.642 --> 08:31.243
How was she in the line-up?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.112
What do you mean?

08:34.114 --> 08:36.581
Her confidence?

08:36.583 --> 08:37.582
Not good.

08:37.584 --> 08:38.617
She wasn't clear.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.569
And the perps?

08:40.570 --> 08:42.520
was a giveaway-- nervous.
The young kid

08:42.523 --> 08:44.222
He'd never been in a line-up.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.592
Is this thing unraveling?

08:47.594 --> 08:51.296
There's no DNA match
on the semen samples.

08:51.298 --> 08:52.764
Oh, come on, that's crap.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.231
They bragged about it
all over the neighborhood.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.698
We got their confession
on tape.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.536
Conflicting.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.539
Yeah, well, still...

09:03.277 --> 09:05.110
So there's no match.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.679
That doesn't mean
she wasn't raped.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.282
What are you going to do?

09:10.284 --> 09:14.185
Hope she slept with someone
before the attack.

09:18.859 --> 09:21.226
Four in the last
half hour.

09:21.228 --> 09:23.328
Press thinks the case
may be slipping away.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.829
How do you think they'd react

09:24.831 --> 09:26.298
if they sensed the opportunity

09:26.300 --> 09:27.799
to publicly fry
one of their own?

09:27.801 --> 09:29.267
Meaning what?

09:29.269 --> 09:32.804
Advance copy
of tomorrow's<i> Ledger.</i>

09:35.709 --> 09:37.142
This backed up?

09:37.144 --> 09:39.144
They know
she's got a record.

09:39.146 --> 09:40.212
A five-year-old bust.

09:40.213 --> 09:41.279
She was there
to research her story.

09:41.281 --> 09:43.682
Can't we counter
with a statement?

09:43.684 --> 09:45.684
Like what?

09:45.686 --> 09:48.687
Everybody past fifth grade
should understand relevance?

09:48.689 --> 09:51.256
Reasonable doubt
in the mind of a jury.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.757
The defense will run with it.

09:53.894 --> 09:56.294
One drug arrest five years ago.

09:56.296 --> 09:58.163
It's like another lifetime.

09:58.165 --> 10:00.165
But now, because
it's on page six,

10:00.167 --> 10:02.167
I can be raped without penalty.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.636
It's not a question
of abstract application

10:04.638 --> 10:06.738
of the law, Miss De Vries.
It is perception.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.907
We're dealing with
the collective minds

10:08.909 --> 10:10.909
and morals of a jury.

10:10.911 --> 10:13.144
And often it's just a question
of cause and effect.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.613
What was she doing
down there?

10:14.615 --> 10:16.147
Why was she dressed
like that?

10:16.149 --> 10:17.649
And... what's her background?

10:17.651 --> 10:18.917
Jurors are not computers.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.885
These things do have
an impact on them.

10:20.887 --> 10:24.322
Maybe they'd like to check
between my toes for needle marks

10:24.324 --> 10:26.291
before they rule.

10:26.293 --> 10:27.392
I'll pass.

10:27.394 --> 10:29.894
I've already been
bent over once.

10:35.268 --> 10:38.236
Unfortunately, we can
no longer prosecute

10:38.238 --> 10:40.205
without you on the stand.

10:40.207 --> 10:44.643
You told me you had no problem
with me being off the stand--

10:44.645 --> 10:46.678
that the drug arrest
might cloud the issue.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.279
And in a perfect
world, it would,

10:48.281 --> 10:50.415
but your friends in the fourth
estate have taken that choice

10:50.417 --> 10:51.383
out of our hands.

10:51.385 --> 10:53.652
Plus, we didn't
get a match

10:53.654 --> 10:55.220
on the DNA tests.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.355
What?!
Do you have
a boyfriend?

10:57.357 --> 10:59.724
Someone you might have slept
with before the attack?

10:59.726 --> 11:02.427
What the hell does that matter?

11:02.429 --> 11:04.329
Does that mean I wasn't raped?

11:04.331 --> 11:06.665
The defense will probably
ask for a blood sample.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.668
What, from every guy they think
I might have had sex with?

11:09.670 --> 11:11.970
Monica, I don't want
to diminish the rape,

11:11.972 --> 11:13.238
but you're a reporter.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.873
Try processing the facts.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.243
If it's the system you abhor,
make a decision.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.311
Do you want these people
who violated you

11:20.313 --> 11:22.347
to walk uncontested?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.816
No one in this room

11:24.818 --> 11:28.353
has the ability to redesign
the entire railroad.

11:28.355 --> 11:32.323
So I should just lash myself
to the front of the train?

11:32.325 --> 11:34.325
Make my peers really happy.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.895
Give them a lot to write about.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.164
You think
this is enough newsprint

11:39.166 --> 11:41.466
dedicated to one rape
investigation?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.201
Everything but my name.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.736
How polite of them.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.171
I think
there's enough newsprint,

11:46.173 --> 11:47.372
that if you don't testify,

11:47.374 --> 11:49.174
you're sending a very
a dangerous message

11:49.176 --> 11:50.275
to the women of this city.

11:50.277 --> 11:52.277
That a rape victim's
chances

11:52.279 --> 11:54.179
for justice
are so slim,

11:54.181 --> 11:57.315
she might as well
not even press charges.

11:57.317 --> 12:00.285
You are a public figure.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.420
People do watch what you do.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.223
It's difficult
for any woman.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.393
I'd be lying to myself if I
thought it was easier for you.

12:08.395 --> 12:11.262
Testifying might be

12:11.264 --> 12:13.465
the only way to counter this.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.875
The<i> Post,</i> the<i> Times,</i>
everything to<i> Vanity Fair.</i>

12:23.877 --> 12:25.276
She's right.

12:25.278 --> 12:26.511
Everybody's taken a shot.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.513
She's not named,
but she's well-known enough

12:28.515 --> 12:33.284
so that the description
does just as much damage.

12:33.286 --> 12:35.286
Who provided
the most coverage?

12:35.288 --> 12:36.421
The<i> Post.</i>

12:36.423 --> 12:38.523
You know anyone
over there?

12:38.525 --> 12:40.525
One or two people. Why?

12:40.527 --> 12:44.262
We need as much background
on her as possible.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.264
You think
she's still using?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.833
If she is,
I'd like to know

12:48.835 --> 12:52.003
before the rest
of the world does.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.505
Thank you.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.275
Lunch? Thanks a lot.

12:57.277 --> 13:01.980
Look, the bottom line is,
nobody's gone too far.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.415
Every news source in town
has practically I.D.'d her.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.917
No more than any other
rape victim.

13:05.919 --> 13:08.319
A well-known investigative
reporter for local TV

13:08.321 --> 13:10.922
whose oft-criticized style
of sensational exploitive
coverage...?

13:10.924 --> 13:12.457
Listen, listen, man.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.460
She's a local minor celebrity;
people want to follow the case.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.462
And the need to read
drives the press

13:17.464 --> 13:19.297
to print speculations
like a drug habit?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.799
Can I put it this way?
Nobody I know

13:20.801 --> 13:22.934
is afraid
of a civil suit for libel.

13:22.936 --> 13:25.403
She says she's clean.

13:25.404 --> 13:27.871
Plus, I talked to her producers.
They verified the assignment.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.275
Her producers?
What are they going to say?

13:30.277 --> 13:31.543
She's a commodity, man.

13:31.545 --> 13:33.945
You think
they're going to burn her?

13:33.947 --> 13:35.513
But her peers will?

13:35.515 --> 13:39.317
Her peers? Maybe her peers think
she got what she deserved.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.019
Why? Because they think
she was buying

13:41.021 --> 13:42.854
or because they think
she's a bitch?

13:42.856 --> 13:48.493
Look, I'm not here
to make any accusations,

13:48.495 --> 13:51.496
but if you listen to what
the hallway rumors are,

13:51.498 --> 13:54.566
that's what
she was down there for.

13:58.471 --> 14:01.372
were there, Miss De Vries?
How many assailants

14:01.374 --> 14:02.473
There were three.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.342
And did all three of these men

14:04.344 --> 14:06.477
attempt to engage in
sexual acts with
you on that day?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.946
I think so.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.480
And you originally
told police

14:09.482 --> 14:11.482
that there may have been
as many as five assailants.

14:11.484 --> 14:12.483
Is that not true?

14:12.485 --> 14:14.185
I was confused.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.886
that you were traumatized,
And the hospital reports

14:15.889 --> 14:17.355
trauma-induced amnesia.
and suffering from

14:17.357 --> 14:18.356
Is that correct?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.357
Yes, that's right.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.491
You remember now.

14:20.493 --> 14:21.837
Yes.

14:21.838 --> 14:23.182
Remember the day
and the time of day,
Yes.

14:23.183 --> 14:24.527
how warm it was.
So warm that it made you

14:24.531 --> 14:26.130
want to take your jacket off.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.533
You remember the stoop
they forced you under,

14:28.535 --> 14:31.502
screaming for help
and begging for mercy.

14:31.504 --> 14:32.937
Yes, that's right.
And yet you
cannot remember

14:32.939 --> 14:34.505
how many men tried
to have sex with you.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.507
That's not the same thing.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.508
Did any of these men try
to have sex with you?
Yes, damn it!

14:38.511 --> 14:40.612
Fine, then will you submit
to a drug test Miss De Vries?

14:40.614 --> 14:42.580
What the hell is going on?!

14:42.582 --> 14:44.148
And at that point,
I'd jump up

14:44.150 --> 14:46.417
and yell "Objection."

14:46.419 --> 14:49.053
And then what would happen?

14:49.055 --> 14:51.306
I'd argue relevance.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.558
The defense would state
that you were there to buy drugs

14:53.560 --> 14:56.895
or already under
the influence of them,

14:56.897 --> 15:00.031
thus your recall
or your actions

15:00.033 --> 15:04.469
were radically different
from what we're stating.

15:04.471 --> 15:07.038
And you would say...?

15:07.040 --> 15:09.474
I don't know.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.643
Why don't you tell me?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.046
Word has it,

15:15.048 --> 15:18.182
your habit is not as old
as you'd like to think.

15:20.487 --> 15:23.922
I was not high.

15:32.198 --> 15:34.632
Okay. That's a start.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.443
Were you there to buy drugs?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.546
I was raped.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.482
What the hell difference does it
make why I was down there?

15:51.484 --> 15:54.335
It doesn't.

15:54.336 --> 15:57.187
I don't care if you were there
to buy a nuclear bomb.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.490
You are not on trial.

15:59.492 --> 16:02.493
But I cannot prosecute
effectively

16:02.495 --> 16:06.130
if I have to worry
what's around every corner.

16:13.139 --> 16:17.108
I asked them if they had
any coke for sale.

16:17.110 --> 16:18.643
Them?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.411
The boys who raped you?

16:20.413 --> 16:22.413
It was for the story...

16:22.415 --> 16:24.649
to check on availability.

16:34.027 --> 16:36.728
Hurts us
that she initiated contact.

16:36.730 --> 16:39.564
Defense will state
it could have been a come-on.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.566
That's a beatable

16:41.568 --> 16:43.668
if the jury buys
that her request for coke

16:43.670 --> 16:44.769
was research.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.204
Do you?

16:46.206 --> 16:48.006
No, but I don't have
any choice.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.008
It's her memory I'm
concerned about now.

16:50.010 --> 16:54.579
Her recollection on a lot of
the details did feel co-mingled.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.581
Could have been culled
from the papers.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.450
Yeah, too good on some,
nonexistent on others.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.019
She remembered that she
scratched someone.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.587
That her actual memory?

17:02.589 --> 17:06.591
"I remember clawing
at a sweaty face."

17:06.593 --> 17:09.060
Police report
does not list scratches

17:09.062 --> 17:10.595
on any of the accused,

17:10.597 --> 17:13.631
and there was no tissue
under her fingernails.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.034
And the<i> Post</i> and another paper
both described that

17:16.036 --> 17:17.235
in portrayal pieces.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.607
She hadn't talked
to any reporters.

17:22.609 --> 17:26.077
They took license,
did not present as fact

17:26.079 --> 17:29.080
and she latched on to that.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.616
Do you think
it was a conscious attempt?

17:31.618 --> 17:33.184
My best guess, no.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.186
I'd say that she's
filling in the blanks

17:35.188 --> 17:37.655
and what better source
than news accounts?

17:38.758 --> 17:41.826
Makes her a liability
on the stand.

17:41.828 --> 17:45.797
Which means we'd better find
out, one way or the other.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.202
At this point, she had

17:51.204 --> 17:53.271
no recollection
of the event at all?

17:53.273 --> 17:54.806
Well, she knew what
had happened to her,

17:54.808 --> 17:57.175
but only because
she'd been told,

17:57.177 --> 17:59.610
and she was still
in physical pain.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.712
Any rule of thumb

18:01.714 --> 18:03.714
on how much
usually comes back?

18:03.716 --> 18:06.084
It differs case to case.

18:06.086 --> 18:07.585
Best-hope scenario?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.755
Usually the mind
will only go so far.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.691
It'll fill in
the areas of information

18:13.693 --> 18:15.710
around the assault,

18:15.711 --> 18:17.728
but, uh, it won't go
all the way back

18:17.730 --> 18:19.664
into the pain.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.233
Thanks.

18:22.235 --> 18:25.236
If we put her
on the stand now,
they'll shred us.

18:27.107 --> 18:29.640
I don't know.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.642
Public hears dismissal,

18:31.644 --> 18:33.544
they think
the case has been dropped.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.347
We'll be editorialized
from hell to breakfast.

18:36.349 --> 18:38.716
I'll refile soon as
something breaks.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.285
Yeah, well, they won't let you
finish the sentence.

18:41.287 --> 18:45.123
The press hears dismissal,
that's it.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.824
Well, then
you tell me
what to do.

18:46.826 --> 18:49.360
Judicial calendar
has already been announced.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.629
Who did you draw?
Scanlon.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.265
Tough on rape.
Could have done worse.

18:54.267 --> 18:57.668
Adam, she had poor recall
in the mock cross,

18:57.670 --> 19:01.272
and her own doctor doubts
the details have returned.

19:01.274 --> 19:04.275
That, combined with
the drug use rumor,

19:04.277 --> 19:05.877
the fact that
she asked about coke--

19:05.879 --> 19:07.345
whether it was
research or not--

19:07.347 --> 19:08.746
puts her in a
pretty negative light.

19:08.748 --> 19:10.681
What about the gun charge
on Metzler?

19:10.683 --> 19:12.416
Criminal possession,
third degree.

19:12.418 --> 19:14.101
He never even fired it.

19:14.102 --> 19:15.785
He had intent,
but with three
court officers

19:15.788 --> 19:17.822
wresting for control...
That's an "E" felony.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.590
Would you rather let him walk?

19:19.592 --> 19:21.192
It's his first offense.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.261
They'll plead to a
class "A" misdemeanor.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.429
He'll walk, and then we'll
really look desperate.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.431
We'll hold it.

19:27.433 --> 19:29.634
We'll tack it on the rape
if we get it.

19:29.636 --> 19:31.669
All right, you just
do me the favor,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.838
and you go as fast
as you can to reopen.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.274
We'll get Greevey and Logan
back on the investigation,

19:36.276 --> 19:38.709
and they'll find evidence
to open up the Cutrona kid.

19:38.711 --> 19:41.162
It lies with him.

19:41.163 --> 19:43.614
Somebody's got to talk
to Monica De Vries.

19:43.616 --> 19:46.617
STONE:
If we go into trial
now and we lose

19:46.619 --> 19:49.787
we cannot go after
them again, ever.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.727
You asked me what
I thought the odds were.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.729
I'm giving you
a fair assessment.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.465
It will be swept
into some pending file.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.900
ROBINETTE:
Monica, we're not
dropping the case.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.903
Oh, and we'll have a better
chance two months from now?

20:05.905 --> 20:09.240
Hopefully we can go in
with more substantive evidence.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.342
What more could you possibly
need? They've confessed.

20:11.344 --> 20:14.478
I need you on the stand,
and I can't put you there.

20:14.480 --> 20:17.215
I agreed, for God's sake.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.749
You don't remember.

20:18.751 --> 20:20.351
What?

20:20.353 --> 20:21.886
You don't remember
the events.

20:21.888 --> 20:25.756
Your mind has picked up on a
mixture of facts and speculation

20:25.758 --> 20:27.358
from the news media,
and blended them together

20:27.360 --> 20:28.893
into something
that you believe.

20:28.895 --> 20:31.229
But if I put you on the stand,

20:31.231 --> 20:32.496
any defense attorney
in this city

20:32.498 --> 20:36.367
will blow enough holes
in that case to bury us.

20:36.369 --> 20:38.703
What matters
is that they did it.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.973
Yes, that matters, but the three
of us knowing that in this room,

20:41.975 --> 20:45.977
is not a substitute for proof,
and I do intend to prove

20:45.979 --> 20:48.779
that you were raped
by these suspects.

20:52.518 --> 20:56.254
Docket #9357:

20:56.256 --> 20:58.256
Motion to dismiss

20:58.258 --> 21:03.261
in<i> People v. Howard S. Metzler,</i>
<i> Steven B. Hanauer,</i>

21:03.263 --> 21:05.263
<i> Ryan M. Cutrona.</i>

21:05.265 --> 21:07.331
Mr. Robinette?

21:07.333 --> 21:12.336
Your Honor, with respect
to the people's motion,

21:12.338 --> 21:14.805
I'd like to reiterate
the state's intention

21:14.807 --> 21:16.974
to reopen this case
on such a date

21:16.976 --> 21:19.343
when further evidence
is obtained.

21:19.345 --> 21:22.280
Otherwise, the people's position
is clearly stated

21:22.282 --> 21:24.048
in the papers filed earlier.

21:24.050 --> 21:28.286
Your comments are so noted,
Mr. Robinette.

21:28.288 --> 21:33.291
Case #9357 is dismissed.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.293
Defendants are free to go.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.361
(<i> gavel pounding</i> )

21:46.839 --> 21:47.905
Whoo!

21:53.579 --> 21:55.046
Whoo!

22:04.924 --> 22:07.625
I'd just like to get this case
back up and running

22:07.627 --> 22:09.960
as quickly as possible.
If it sits,

22:09.962 --> 22:11.896
we run the risk
of it collapsing completely,

22:11.898 --> 22:13.497
and this case
is not un-winnable.

22:13.499 --> 22:14.799
Now, now wait a minute.

22:14.801 --> 22:15.966
We gave you enough
to prosecute.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.768
We're not the ones
who blew this thing.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.320
This is not
an assessment of blame.

22:19.321 --> 22:20.871
It's a petition to put the case
back together.

22:20.873 --> 22:23.674
We've got a victim who is
co-mingling fact and fiction,

22:23.676 --> 22:25.076
and our defendant

22:25.077 --> 22:26.477
who is holding back
relevant information.

22:26.479 --> 22:28.012
So how do we get the truth?

22:28.014 --> 22:30.014
You made the motion
to dismiss.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.782
You got any ideas?

22:31.784 --> 22:34.819
No, I don't have any ideas;
that's why I'm here!

22:34.821 --> 22:36.721
All right, fellas, could we
please hold this down

22:36.723 --> 22:37.955
to a dull head stomp?

22:37.957 --> 22:39.657
We're thin.

22:39.659 --> 22:42.059
It's obvious they're holding
something back.

22:42.061 --> 22:43.527
And if we weren't confident

22:43.528 --> 22:44.994
that you could provide
that<i> something</i> for us,

22:44.997 --> 22:46.831
we would have taken our shots
with the jury.

22:46.833 --> 22:50.468
And as for suggestions,
I don't have any ideas.

22:50.470 --> 22:52.903
We weren't able to leverage
Hanauer or Metzler,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.106
and the younger kid
is not forthcoming.

22:55.108 --> 22:56.841
He's not going to give it up

22:56.843 --> 22:59.110
now that the case
has been dismissed.

22:59.112 --> 23:02.079
But if you guys
can find a back door...

23:02.081 --> 23:05.116
Well, maybe we press
the two older kids--

23:05.118 --> 23:08.586
work some kind
of a play on them.

23:10.623 --> 23:13.624
We'll backtrack
through our notes--

23:13.626 --> 23:15.659
see what pops up.

23:17.029 --> 23:20.030
All right, three weeks.

23:20.032 --> 23:22.066
That's all I can afford
with their case load.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.535
Thanks.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.571
Personal effects.

23:27.573 --> 23:28.706
Monica De Vries.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.074
She never picked them up.

23:30.076 --> 23:31.509
Never will
either.

23:31.511 --> 23:33.577
Reminds her too much.

23:33.579 --> 23:35.713
I can't say as
I blame her.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.848
Mind if I borrow this?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.850
Oh, no, Paul.

23:39.852 --> 23:41.152
We have our own.

23:46.125 --> 23:47.725
All right.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.861
"They stopped here
around 3:15 in the afternoon.

23:50.863 --> 23:53.130
"They forced her down
under that stoop.

23:53.132 --> 23:55.633
"General disagreement
on who said what.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.535
"Blouse was ripped off.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.069
"Jacket pulled up
to hold her arms
until it rips.

23:59.071 --> 24:02.072
"Slight shoulder dislocation
during struggle.

24:02.074 --> 24:05.843
The... "
Well... well, now we get
into big discrepancy

24:05.845 --> 24:09.780
as to who was actually
on top... of her.

24:09.782 --> 24:13.584
E.R. report--
"multiple attackers."

24:13.586 --> 24:16.587
How many of these buildings
did we canvass?

24:16.589 --> 24:17.988
We canvassed both sides.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.540
The whole block.

24:19.541 --> 24:21.091
Came up with nothing.
No witnesses.

24:21.093 --> 24:22.993
Just a lot of listeners.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.995
The post-Kitty Genovese era.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.997
No one wants to look--
they think they'll get involved.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.066
This building
and the one next to it--

24:29.068 --> 24:33.604
weren't there a couple of
apartments we never got?

24:35.141 --> 24:36.607
Yeah.

24:36.609 --> 24:37.875
#1-B right here.

24:37.877 --> 24:39.076
Fifth, sixth
and eleventh.

24:39.078 --> 24:40.811
Left notes each time.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.213
Upstairs same thing.

24:42.215 --> 24:45.115
(<i> sighs</i> ):
Good a place as any.

24:45.117 --> 24:47.885
It's about the rape
that happened out front.

24:47.887 --> 24:49.019
I was gone.

24:49.021 --> 24:51.789
Upstate at my sister's.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.123
Did you hear anything
from any of the neighbors

24:53.125 --> 24:54.625
about that day?

24:54.627 --> 24:56.126
You still haven't caught them?

24:56.128 --> 25:00.197
LOGAN:
Hey, Max, let me get in here,
let me get in here.

25:00.199 --> 25:01.932
Yes, ma'am, we have.

25:01.934 --> 25:03.801
We're just following up.

25:03.803 --> 25:05.486
We were wondering, you know,

25:05.487 --> 25:07.170
did you hear anything since
then, you know, talk, rumors?

25:07.173 --> 25:09.106
I don't go out.

25:09.108 --> 25:11.108
This is as far out
in the world as I go

25:11.110 --> 25:12.610
without my son.

25:12.612 --> 25:13.844
(<i> door slams, lock clicks</i> )

25:13.846 --> 25:16.146
You'd better believe
I wasn't at home.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.748
20 hours of labor.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.717
Besides, I called.

25:19.719 --> 25:22.019
I left a message
at the number you left.

25:22.021 --> 25:24.622
We never got it.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.056
What a surprise.

25:26.058 --> 25:28.158
Miss Varella, was there
any talk in the building

25:28.160 --> 25:30.160
about what people
heard or saw?

25:30.162 --> 25:31.996
Yeah, there were more people
here in one weekend

25:31.998 --> 25:33.898
than I've talked to
in two years.

25:33.900 --> 25:35.900
How come you only
arrested three?

25:35.902 --> 25:37.801
Why? Did you think
there was more?

25:37.803 --> 25:41.138
Guy down in C, Silva,
heard the whole thing.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.973
Said it was
six or seven?

25:42.975 --> 25:46.844
Well, wasn't it?

25:46.846 --> 25:49.179
I heard the case
was dismissed.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.782
That doesn't mean
it's closed.

25:51.784 --> 25:54.985
Did you hear the rape,
Mr. Silva?

25:54.987 --> 25:56.220
Most of it.

25:56.222 --> 26:00.257
Although I wasn't sure
of what was going on.

26:00.259 --> 26:03.894
I mean, this street...

26:03.896 --> 26:05.195
Didn't we talk to you?

26:05.197 --> 26:07.231
We got a statement down
from you.

26:07.233 --> 26:10.935
I said that I was gone.

26:12.305 --> 26:18.175
I was going through something
with a friend of mine.

26:18.177 --> 26:21.245
I didn't want him to know
I was here.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.182
You didn't call 911
during the attack?

26:25.184 --> 26:27.318
I wasn't sure at first.

26:27.320 --> 26:30.988
Uh, I know
I was wrong not to.

26:30.990 --> 26:33.824
These kids live
around here.

26:33.826 --> 26:38.195
You know how much bashing
goes on on this block?

26:38.197 --> 26:42.232
Besides, I heard
you were making arrests, so...

26:42.234 --> 26:45.002
How many people did you hear?

26:45.004 --> 26:48.272
I thought I might
have heard, uh, five.

26:51.210 --> 26:56.747
I... I, uh... I guess
I might have heard three.

26:56.749 --> 26:59.116
I tell you,
it's more of a mess now

26:59.118 --> 27:01.118
than it was
two months ago.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.219
People don't know
what they heard,

27:02.221 --> 27:03.988
what they saw,
what they didn't see,

27:03.990 --> 27:05.255
what they heard
on the news,

27:05.257 --> 27:06.890
what they heard
on the street,

27:06.892 --> 27:08.225
what they heard
in the newspapers...

27:08.227 --> 27:10.127
Maybe we'll get a guy down here
with a gold watch--

27:10.129 --> 27:11.295
hypnotizes
the whole neighborhood.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.367
What?

27:16.369 --> 27:20.838
Why don't we take
a legitimate shot with the vic?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.973
Come on, Mike.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.375
It's a weak case as is.

27:24.377 --> 27:27.211
You know how the courts
stand on that.

27:27.213 --> 27:28.696
Hit and miss at best.

27:28.697 --> 27:30.180
No, no, no, I'm not saying
we provide them

27:30.182 --> 27:32.249
with hypnotically-induced
testimony. No.

27:32.251 --> 27:34.318
We'll use it
for investigation only.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.858
Talk to the D.A.

27:43.262 --> 27:46.296
ROBINETTE:
They don't always toss it,

27:46.298 --> 27:49.867
but they have been uneven
in accepting aided testimony.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.869
I know that;
that's not what we're asking.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.204
Look, we're up against
the wall here.

27:54.206 --> 27:55.939
I don't want to put her under,

27:55.941 --> 27:57.775
have a new investigatory
line pop

27:57.777 --> 28:00.277
and then have the courts
tell you guys we can't use it.

28:00.279 --> 28:03.781
It's a good idea. Try it.

28:03.783 --> 28:06.283
But if anything new surfaces
during the session,

28:06.285 --> 28:08.352
we've got to link it
to something substantive

28:08.354 --> 28:10.087
down the line.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.989
It's testimony
I'd rather not use at all

28:11.991 --> 28:14.058
unless it's
extremely compelling.

28:14.060 --> 28:17.127
We'll let you know.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.203
We've got bad news.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.172
It's a tox report.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.907
She left a brush

28:29.909 --> 28:32.209
and some other effects
with the police

28:32.211 --> 28:33.310
after the rape.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.212
The hair
tested positive,

28:35.214 --> 28:37.314
but we could probably
counter it.

28:37.316 --> 28:39.383
It doesn't mean
she was using
on that day.

28:44.190 --> 28:48.292
Paul, you made
a serious mistake here.

28:48.294 --> 28:51.929
You ordered a lab test
on what basis?

28:51.931 --> 28:54.465
It's for
our knowledge only.

28:54.467 --> 28:57.334
I don't want to
prosecute her on it.

28:57.336 --> 29:01.371
What about her right
to privacy?

29:01.373 --> 29:03.340
Wait a minute.

29:03.342 --> 29:05.342
This was one of your
biggest concerns.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.311
"Let's find out before
the rest of the world does."

29:07.313 --> 29:09.413
That is over the line.

29:09.415 --> 29:12.349
You mean to tell me
it's more important

29:12.351 --> 29:15.352
that we maintain some myth
of blind justice,

29:15.354 --> 29:19.857
walk into court
and get our
butts kicked?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.358
You'd rather not know?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.360
Not if it means circumventing

29:23.362 --> 29:26.196
a basic guaranteed right
of the people.

29:26.198 --> 29:28.966
What about
the Supreme Court's stand

29:28.968 --> 29:30.367
on blind drug testing

29:30.369 --> 29:32.369
mandatory in certain
job classifications?

29:32.371 --> 29:35.072
Not mandatory
when you're raped.

29:45.317 --> 29:48.085
where you were going,
When they asked
MAN:

29:48.087 --> 29:50.420
do you look at their faces?

29:50.422 --> 29:55.292
I think if I look right at them,

29:55.294 --> 29:59.396
they'll stop harassing me.

29:59.398 --> 30:02.366
What do their faces
look like?

30:07.273 --> 30:10.240
They're young.

30:10.242 --> 30:15.512
Late teens, early 20s.

30:15.514 --> 30:19.416
The youngest looks frightened.

30:19.418 --> 30:22.986
The others are bigger.

30:22.988 --> 30:25.088
They seem older.

30:27.393 --> 30:30.494
Which one is
the most intimidating?

30:30.496 --> 30:34.097
The oldest.

30:37.269 --> 30:40.237
He doesn't have any life
in his eyes.

30:43.275 --> 30:44.975
I know he's the most dangerous.

30:49.381 --> 30:53.517
He doesn't care that I'm afraid.

30:53.519 --> 30:58.188
He's not excited by it.

30:58.190 --> 31:00.324
Not like the other three.

31:00.326 --> 31:02.259
They're there for him.

31:05.564 --> 31:10.100
Monica, let's back up
for a second.

31:10.102 --> 31:13.103
When you were describing
the boys,

31:13.105 --> 31:16.607
did you mean to describe
three or four to me?

31:19.411 --> 31:21.211
Four.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.380
Are you sure?

31:23.382 --> 31:26.483
You're sure?

31:26.485 --> 31:29.353
Yes.

31:31.557 --> 31:39.363
Now I'm going to ask you
to relax even further.

31:39.365 --> 31:43.367
Remember, these are
only memories.

31:43.369 --> 31:47.170
They cannot hurt you.

31:47.172 --> 31:51.642
This fourth boy--
who is the oldest--

31:51.644 --> 31:57.314
focus in on him,
and tell me about his face.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.518
Gaunt.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.591
Drawn.

32:07.593 --> 32:14.598
Looks that might once
have been good-looking.

32:14.600 --> 32:20.337
He has green eyes.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.540
He has a scar
over his right eye.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.543
His skin is pale.

32:26.545 --> 32:31.348
His hair
looks unwashed.

32:31.350 --> 32:35.252
Did you, at any time
during the attack

32:35.254 --> 32:38.221
hear his name used?

32:43.562 --> 32:46.430
Tim.

32:46.432 --> 32:50.233
We know there was a fourth guy.

32:50.235 --> 32:52.669
We know he committed
the majority of the rape.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.371
We got his first name.

32:54.373 --> 32:57.274
I say we use it
against the other three.

32:57.276 --> 32:59.109
One of them is
bound to collapse.

32:59.111 --> 33:01.311
It would only
tip our hand.

33:01.313 --> 33:04.181
Something in here
has got to lead to him.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.183
She told us
who did what.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.352
Who held her, who
performed what acts.

33:08.354 --> 33:10.287
The fact he tried to get her
to fellate him.

33:10.289 --> 33:11.688
The threats
to slash her face.

33:11.690 --> 33:13.557
We got everything we need
except the fourth guy.

33:13.559 --> 33:15.492
We pick him up,

33:15.494 --> 33:17.561
we get a blood test,
a match on the semen sample,

33:17.563 --> 33:19.496
it's a slam dunk,
the other three
go down with him.

33:19.498 --> 33:22.199
Fine, let's go pick him up.

33:22.201 --> 33:23.333
His name's Tim.

33:23.335 --> 33:25.502
Aw, come on, Max.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.670
You know what the hell
I'm talking about here.

33:29.608 --> 33:32.342
All right,
you want to make a move?

33:32.344 --> 33:34.478
Let's check the stoop for glass.

33:34.480 --> 33:36.446
What?

33:36.448 --> 33:39.249
She remembered them
breaking a bottle,

33:39.251 --> 33:41.752
threatening to slash
her face, right?

33:41.754 --> 33:45.489
Two months later,
you think we're going
to find anything?

33:45.491 --> 33:48.558
When was the last time
you swept under your stoop?

33:50.396 --> 33:53.363
Ooh, this is making me nauseous.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.499
Gee, that's funny, Max.
You ought to come down here.

33:55.501 --> 33:58.502
I was thinking of puking
just to improve the smell.

33:58.504 --> 34:01.538
Oop, more glass.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.573
Okay, send it up.

34:09.281 --> 34:12.249
Remind me never
to eat at your house.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.351
They're perfectly good tongs.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.586
You think I'm going
to throw them away?

34:16.588 --> 34:18.722
You got a couple
of partials.

34:18.724 --> 34:20.724
Third and fourth
fingerprints

34:20.726 --> 34:22.726
on one of
the fragments--

34:22.728 --> 34:24.227
I think it's
a bottle neck.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.796
Run a cross-check
on every set we got.

34:25.798 --> 34:27.764
First name Tim,
Timothy...

34:27.766 --> 34:29.733
Do all the Ts
just to be safe.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.668
This is gonna
take some time.

34:31.670 --> 34:34.504
Hey! Do I look like
I'm in a hurry?

34:34.506 --> 34:36.606
Timothy Pruiting!

34:36.608 --> 34:39.776
Three assaults,
two narco pops,
one sale weight.

34:39.778 --> 34:42.479
Partial matches on middle
and ring finger.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.481
Great. It's not enough.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.649
They're only partial matches.

34:45.651 --> 34:48.318
There's at least

34:48.320 --> 34:49.619
35 other possible
match-ups here.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.388
He lives two blocks
from the scene.

34:51.390 --> 34:53.507
He's been popped for dealing.

34:53.508 --> 34:55.625
Narcotics says Metzler and
Hanauer have been running

34:55.627 --> 34:56.793
for him for months.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.396
Fine. The prints place him
at the scene,

34:59.398 --> 35:01.298
not the<i> time</i> of the attack.

35:01.300 --> 35:03.233
We pop him, he'll
match on the DNA.

35:03.235 --> 35:05.269
And what if he doesn't?

35:05.270 --> 35:07.304
There's no sex offenses here;
what do we hold him on?

35:07.306 --> 35:08.438
I don't know.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.573
This guy fits.

35:09.575 --> 35:12.309
Tooley down in Narcotics

35:12.311 --> 35:14.444
says he'd gut his mother
for a nickel.

35:14.446 --> 35:17.581
The Cutrona kid's
probably scared to death.

35:17.583 --> 35:21.451
Look, guys, do I have to speak
<i> slowly</i> here?

35:21.453 --> 35:24.321
Yes, I think he's our guy.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.423
Yes, I would like
to pop him,

35:26.425 --> 35:27.824
but this thing
has been dismissed once already.

35:27.826 --> 35:31.328
We cannot go off half-cocked.
We need more.

35:31.330 --> 35:33.363
Like what?

35:33.365 --> 35:36.867
Like testimony
from the Cutrona kid.

35:36.869 --> 35:39.603
A statement, anything.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.605
We'll give him a run.

35:41.607 --> 35:44.574
Good, Mike,
because I don't think

35:44.576 --> 35:48.879
he's going to come
waltzing in here on his own.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.621
We know
he was there.

35:57.623 --> 35:59.890
We need you
to testify
against him.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.758
You do that, the D.A.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.527
will reduce the rape
charges against you.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.761
How far?

36:04.763 --> 36:06.263
You'd have
to talk to Stone,

36:06.265 --> 36:08.765
but he assured me
no time.

36:08.767 --> 36:12.335
What about working
for Pruiting?

36:12.337 --> 36:13.803
You're not up
on the drug charges.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.806
The hope is you'd clean
that up by yourself.

36:16.808 --> 36:19.609
He said he'd kill me.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.445
You let us
worry about that.

36:22.447 --> 36:24.514
Truth is,
he's a punk.

36:24.516 --> 36:26.516
He's not going to
last long in prison.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.718
You'd be the least
of his problems.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.365
He'll testify.

36:42.367 --> 36:44.434
(<i> sigh of relief</i> )

36:49.575 --> 36:50.740
(<i> hammer cocking</i> )

37:05.824 --> 37:07.791
Police! Timothy Pruiting,
you're under arrest!

37:07.793 --> 37:09.359
Hold it!

37:09.361 --> 37:10.860
Get off of me, man!

37:10.862 --> 37:13.597
You're charged with
rape and assault.

37:13.599 --> 37:15.632
You have the right
to remain silent... Freeze!

37:15.634 --> 37:18.435
Those little bastards
ratted on me, man!

37:18.437 --> 37:20.437
I'm not, I'm not
going down alone!

37:20.439 --> 37:21.571
You hear me?!

37:21.573 --> 37:23.573
You think
I'm lying here?!

37:23.575 --> 37:24.874
Those little jerks
were with me when we did it!

37:24.876 --> 37:27.711
I want those
little humps!
Put something on.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.614
The little punks will say
whatever you want to hear.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.336
(<i> knock at door</i> )

38:04.416 --> 38:05.649
What the hell's
going on?

38:05.651 --> 38:07.817
When was he
mirandized at the bust?

38:07.819 --> 38:10.387
Hey, that's crap
if he's saying

38:10.389 --> 38:11.788
he wasn't mirandized.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.723
I read them as we
were taking him out.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.559
<i> After</i> he made
the statements.

38:16.561 --> 38:19.529
Oh, are you going
to tell us about our day?

38:19.531 --> 38:21.398
Sounds like
spontaneous declaration to me.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.632
Fine, it will fall into
"for what it's worth"

38:22.634 --> 38:24.367
and I'll bury it.

38:24.369 --> 38:25.869
I'll be with my client.

38:25.871 --> 38:28.538
Let's not have this
take all day.

38:33.378 --> 38:37.580
Look, I started
during his statements.

38:37.582 --> 38:39.516
The guy was
screaming like crazy.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.151
Then the girl made the move.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.785
I re-read them after
everything calmed down.

38:42.788 --> 38:45.555
Hey, this guy was
out of his mind high.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.090
He was blurting things
out left and right.

38:47.092 --> 38:48.525
It doesn't matter.

38:48.527 --> 38:50.427
I'll make it admissible.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.595
Taggart will take
the wind out of it.

38:52.597 --> 38:54.431
His statements may be
too vague to help us anyway.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.900
So why aren't we asking
for a blood sample?

38:56.902 --> 38:58.735
Because we have
a problem.

38:58.737 --> 38:59.803
Oh?

38:59.805 --> 39:02.539
You can't subpoena blood samples

39:02.541 --> 39:06.509
if you have nothing
to match it against.

39:06.511 --> 39:11.481
Forensics seems to have
misplaced the rape samples.

39:11.483 --> 39:13.616
What?

39:13.618 --> 39:14.884
(<i> sighs</i> )

39:14.886 --> 39:17.487
This is unbelievable.

39:17.489 --> 39:19.556
And they're continuing
to look, but my guess is,

39:19.558 --> 39:21.524
some idiot saw the paperwork
come through on the dismissal

39:21.526 --> 39:22.792
and out they went.

39:22.794 --> 39:24.561
That's incredible.

39:24.563 --> 39:27.630
Which leaves us
with not much.

39:27.632 --> 39:29.966
What do you
want to do?

39:29.968 --> 39:32.836
Well, that's what
we're here to decide.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.839
I can't justify
much longer detaining
Pruiting to his lawyers.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.541
Even with the Cutrona kid's
statement?

39:38.543 --> 39:40.810
That's an uncorroborated
statement,

39:40.812 --> 39:42.545
coming from an accomplice.

39:42.547 --> 39:46.383
We need something
to back that up with.

39:47.719 --> 39:50.620
How long can you justify
holding him?

39:53.525 --> 39:56.726
Duck a couple of phone calls
from his attorney.

39:56.728 --> 39:57.927
After that...

39:57.929 --> 40:00.530
After that,
you lose the paperwork.

40:00.532 --> 40:02.632
Max, what is this?

40:02.634 --> 40:03.900
Last shot.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.536
Get Metzler and Hanauer to roll.

40:06.538 --> 40:07.737
We got no leverage.

40:07.739 --> 40:08.938
What the hell is going on?

40:10.842 --> 40:12.509
Max, no deals.

40:12.511 --> 40:13.943
I want the other two
as much as Pruiting.

40:23.955 --> 40:28.525
GREEVEY:
Look at those mooks,
still selling crack.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.465
Gentlemen.

40:35.467 --> 40:37.700
If this is a roust,
you got no cause.

40:37.702 --> 40:39.869
Hey, you think we need cause,
ant brain, huh?

40:39.871 --> 40:42.672
You think we don't know
how to move vials, huh?

40:42.674 --> 40:43.873
GREEVEY:
Hey, Mike.

40:46.845 --> 40:50.513
No roust, no charges,
no interrogation.

40:50.515 --> 40:52.015
Just come in,
make some statements.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.016
We listen...

40:53.018 --> 40:54.651
Listen to what?

40:54.653 --> 40:56.486
Your version
of what happened.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.555
Since Tim Pruiting's
been in all day screaming

40:58.557 --> 40:59.923
that he didn't rape
Monica De Vries.

40:59.925 --> 41:01.758
What?

41:01.760 --> 41:04.227
He says it was you guys.

41:04.229 --> 41:06.596
You're full of it.

41:06.598 --> 41:09.065
Watch your mouth.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.533
You think I pulled that name
out of thin air?

41:11.536 --> 41:14.904
You want me
to describe his place?

41:14.906 --> 41:16.339
In fact, we can drop by.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.773
I'll show you what a mess
we made during the bust.

41:17.776 --> 41:19.809
Is he saying we did her?

41:19.811 --> 41:20.877
That's a load.

41:20.879 --> 41:21.978
Hey, you don't have
to convince us.

41:21.980 --> 41:23.546
We know he did her,

41:23.548 --> 41:26.683
but we got to pop
somebody for it.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.951
It's bull!

41:27.953 --> 41:29.953
You want us to roll.

41:29.955 --> 41:33.056
We already arrested him, genius.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.924
We don't need you
to incriminate him.

41:34.926 --> 41:38.094
So we're not under arrest.

41:38.096 --> 41:40.263
Absolutely not.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.699
Unless...

41:42.701 --> 41:45.969
he convinces us that he's right.

41:49.641 --> 41:52.075
It can't be used against us?

41:52.077 --> 41:55.512
That's the deal.

41:55.514 --> 41:56.846
Tell you what.

41:56.848 --> 41:58.948
I'll make it
really easy.

41:58.950 --> 42:00.750
I'll call legal aid.

42:00.752 --> 42:03.520
They'll set up a room.

42:03.522 --> 42:04.888
You come in.

42:04.890 --> 42:06.055
In and out.

42:06.057 --> 42:07.624
No hanging around.

42:07.626 --> 42:09.559
Give me a quarter.

42:09.561 --> 42:10.560
What?

42:10.562 --> 42:12.095
Give me a quarter.

42:14.699 --> 42:16.599
What are you doing?

42:16.601 --> 42:17.800
Huh?

42:24.142 --> 42:25.608
Hey, that's great, Max.

42:25.610 --> 42:27.010
Now we got even more
unusable statements.

42:27.012 --> 42:29.012
Think so?

42:29.014 --> 42:32.048
Who you calling?

42:32.050 --> 42:33.550
Marie.

42:35.687 --> 42:38.655
Think they have
a reasonable expectation

42:38.657 --> 42:40.156
of privacy right now?

42:40.158 --> 42:42.625
Hi, honey, it's me.

42:42.627 --> 42:46.095
I'll probably
be late tonight.

42:48.033 --> 42:51.568
You're out of your mind,
you know that?

42:51.570 --> 42:53.670
Stone's going to
blow a fuse over this,

42:53.672 --> 42:55.638
and Cragen will strap us
to our desks forever.

42:55.640 --> 42:57.340
Wrong, detective.

42:57.342 --> 43:01.044
They are<i> not</i> under arrest.

43:01.046 --> 43:04.047
Ooh.

43:04.049 --> 43:07.050
HANAUER:
Because if he is,
I'm not taking the fall,

43:07.052 --> 43:08.618
and neither should you.

43:08.620 --> 43:10.487
We didn't do her.
He got off on it.

43:10.488 --> 43:12.355
METZLER:
So what's all this crap
about keeping our mouth shut?

43:12.357 --> 43:14.657
He tells us they got no evidence

43:14.659 --> 43:16.626
because he's the only one
who will match the load,

43:16.628 --> 43:19.062
and he gets picked up and rolls?
Screw him.

43:19.064 --> 43:22.065
HANAUER:
Look, we know what we did;
we just tell it straight.

43:22.067 --> 43:24.701
All we did was hold her,
maybe some other stupid stuff,

43:24.703 --> 43:26.669
but we're not riding down
for Pruiting.

43:26.671 --> 43:27.904
(<i> tape recorder clicks</i> )

43:27.906 --> 43:29.806
All right,
so it's damning.

43:29.808 --> 43:31.674
Do I have
to run a list here, Stone?

43:31.676 --> 43:36.746
Miranda, Bartolameo, the Supreme
Court's Minnick Decision.

43:36.748 --> 43:37.947
The whole thing
is illegally obtained.

43:37.949 --> 43:40.083
They were both
represented by counsel.

43:40.085 --> 43:42.051
Not for the past
two months they weren't.

43:42.053 --> 43:43.837
There were no charges pending,

43:43.838 --> 43:45.622
there was no accusatory
instrument pending,

43:45.624 --> 43:46.889
No outstanding indictment.

43:46.891 --> 43:48.691
I'm sure you know
as well as I do

43:48.693 --> 43:50.159
that Minnick provides
nothing new in New York.

43:50.161 --> 43:52.095
What about their privacy?

43:52.097 --> 43:55.965
The court's stance
on the expectation of privacy

43:55.967 --> 43:57.667
is fairly clear.

43:57.669 --> 44:00.737
Please!
They were sitting in a cop car.

44:00.739 --> 44:03.673
With the doors wide open,
in the middle of the day

44:03.675 --> 44:05.108
in a city street.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.076
You think there's a greater
expectation of privacy there

44:07.078 --> 44:08.745
than on a cordless phone?

44:08.747 --> 44:11.848
And I'm sure you know
the court's stance on that.

44:11.850 --> 44:13.116
It's debatable.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.684
That's not debatable,

44:14.686 --> 44:15.885
that's precedent,

44:15.887 --> 44:18.187
and that's what I'm going
into court with.

44:18.189 --> 44:19.822
You did good work.

44:19.824 --> 44:22.925
Make sure it doesn't get
thrown out of court.

44:22.927 --> 44:25.928
I can't be sure of anything,
but I do know what I believe in,

44:25.930 --> 44:27.864
and I believe you didn't
violate the system.

44:27.866 --> 44:29.999
You want to rearrest
Hanauer and Metzler as well?

44:30.001 --> 44:33.136
Absolutely, no bargains.
The charge is rape.

44:33.138 --> 44:34.771
We'll let their
defense attorneys

44:34.773 --> 44:36.205
figure out whether they
want to sever or not.

44:36.207 --> 44:38.708
I'm sure they know
the procedure by now.

44:38.710 --> 44:39.942
with the Cutrona kid?
What do you want to do

44:39.944 --> 44:41.427
Well, him we need,

44:41.428 --> 44:42.911
and Paul's going to bring
him in for a statement.

44:42.914 --> 44:46.015
I can use that
instead of the DNA match.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.751
Well, our boy Pruiting
just tried to sell

44:48.753 --> 44:50.753
everyone he knows
during booking--

44:50.755 --> 44:52.789
crack dealers, peepers--

44:52.791 --> 44:55.158
all in hopes
of landing a deal.

44:55.160 --> 44:56.826
Hell of a guy.

44:56.828 --> 44:59.095
Yeah, quite a piece
of work.

44:59.097 --> 45:02.031
In the coming days,
you will hear arguments

45:02.033 --> 45:05.301
on whether three men
in this courtroom are guilty

45:05.303 --> 45:07.170
of the crime of rape.

45:07.172 --> 45:10.840
You will then be asked
to decide two things--

45:10.842 --> 45:12.842
the fate of the defendants

45:12.844 --> 45:16.012
and more indirectly,
the fate of a legal system,

45:16.014 --> 45:20.016
a system that is too often
circumvented and mocked

45:20.018 --> 45:23.119
by those who seek
to escape the weight of justice.

45:23.121 --> 45:27.490
A system which can be used
by the defense

45:27.492 --> 45:31.327
to put a woman,
violated against her will,

45:31.329 --> 45:36.332
on trial for anything
ranging from how she was dressed

45:36.334 --> 45:40.770
to why she was
in a particular neighborhood.

45:45.810 --> 45:49.178
It is the state's position
that there are no valid reasons

45:49.180 --> 45:51.080
to justify violent
sexual behavior

45:51.082 --> 45:52.749
against another person's will.

45:52.751 --> 45:55.885
It is my job to present
these facts to you in hope

45:55.887 --> 45:59.055
that you will agree
with the state's position.

45:59.057 --> 46:01.891
It is your job to listen--

46:01.893 --> 46:04.794
to listen how,
through willful intimidation

46:04.796 --> 46:07.230
and a moderate knowledge
of the legal system,

46:07.232 --> 46:09.298
these three men chose to flaunt

46:09.300 --> 46:12.869
their crime of rape
in the face of a woman...

46:16.107 --> 46:19.208
...and in the face
of this system.
