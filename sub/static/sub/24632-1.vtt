02:10.062 --> 02:11.227
We came
back to Baltimore

02:11.229 --> 02:14.229
to pick up the last few things.

02:14.231 --> 02:16.733
I haven't slept in days.

02:16.735 --> 02:18.400
Weird dreams are back.

02:18.402 --> 02:20.038
I can't tell mom.

02:21.073 --> 02:23.205
If I have to see one
more useless doctor

02:23.207 --> 02:27.379
or take another stupid pill,
I'm really gonna go insane.

02:39.356 --> 02:41.360
Come on, Molly!

02:47.431 --> 02:49.899
I hate
leaving this place.

02:49.901 --> 02:51.868
Well you hated living here.

02:51.870 --> 02:55.171
At least in Hallowell you'll
have less people to fight with

02:55.173 --> 02:57.340
and you won't have to
move schools every year

02:57.342 --> 02:59.445
because there's only one.

03:02.114 --> 03:04.280
These are the last bits.

03:04.282 --> 03:06.149
Get the rest of
this stuff, please.

03:06.151 --> 03:08.917
Okay, people, we have to get
Dave's daughter before 10:00

03:08.919 --> 03:10.120
so let's go.

03:10.122 --> 03:12.725
We're picking her up today?

03:14.192 --> 03:17.160
You promised you would
welcome her, remember?

03:40.885 --> 03:43.418
Hello!

04:00.305 --> 04:01.272
Hi.

04:02.507 --> 04:03.342
Heather.

04:05.443 --> 04:07.446
It's so good to see you.

04:09.480 --> 04:12.283
You remember Michael and Molly?

04:16.288 --> 04:18.488
I'm not
sure what's worse,

04:18.490 --> 04:20.490
living in the middle of nowhere,

04:20.492 --> 04:24.263
or starting a new life
with Dave and Heather.

04:26.230 --> 04:30.401
I feel like I'm abandoning
dad, his spirit, in a way.

04:34.139 --> 04:37.442
Michael, will he even
remember him at all?

04:41.346 --> 04:43.048
Maybe mom's right.

04:44.216 --> 04:46.983
Maybe leaving the past behind
is what everyone needs.

05:20.584 --> 05:22.320
Here we are.

05:24.488 --> 05:26.188
Everybody grab something.

05:26.190 --> 05:28.326
Isn't it beautiful?

05:30.262 --> 05:32.527
Careful, my
specimens are in that box.

05:32.529 --> 05:33.363
Okay.

05:34.499 --> 05:36.065
Never moving again.

05:36.067 --> 05:37.369
That's the idea.

05:46.543 --> 05:49.344
Molly, you make
room for other stuff?

05:49.346 --> 05:52.315
Yes, I did when you
asked me yesterday.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.327
Heather, come on.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.075
Do you want this bed?

06:20.077 --> 06:21.546
I really don't care.

06:26.117 --> 06:26.951
Great.

06:52.076 --> 06:53.312
TV's not working.

06:56.747 --> 06:58.481
Take Heather outside.

06:58.483 --> 07:00.315
Do you wanna go outside?

07:00.317 --> 07:01.986
We can tour a bit.

07:03.387 --> 07:06.658
I'm going, so if you wanna
come, you can just...

07:09.995 --> 07:11.629
Can you please fix it?

07:32.684 --> 07:33.519
Heather!

07:36.321 --> 07:37.356
Heather!

07:42.694 --> 07:44.026
Heather!

07:49.767 --> 07:51.700
Where are you?

08:06.050 --> 08:07.418
What are you doing?

08:08.786 --> 08:10.488
Come on, let's go!

08:18.629 --> 08:20.165
You're so weird.

08:39.183 --> 08:40.682
I thought you'd
get an advance.

08:40.683 --> 08:42.150
It doesn't work that way.

08:42.153 --> 08:44.285
I've gotta turn in
a couple chapters.

08:44.288 --> 08:46.388
What are we gonna do
if they decide it's not...

08:46.390 --> 08:49.291
Mom, there's something
strange about this place.

08:49.293 --> 08:50.725
Not what?

08:50.727 --> 08:54.397
I don't know, not what
they're looking for.

08:54.399 --> 08:55.397
Where's Heather?

08:55.399 --> 08:58.401
I don't know, in the woods.

08:58.403 --> 09:00.502
You don't leave a
child alone in the woods.

09:00.504 --> 09:01.804
You were supposed
to look after her.

09:01.806 --> 09:02.704
I told you.

09:02.706 --> 09:03.542
I know.

10:48.712 --> 10:51.280
There's a
ghost outside the house.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.522
There's no one out there.

11:00.524 --> 11:02.391
Okay, bedtime.

11:02.393 --> 11:04.529
It's probably just the wind.

11:11.535 --> 11:12.535
Here you go.

11:12.537 --> 11:13.939
Thanks.

11:22.580 --> 11:26.451
I'm gonna finally
start painting tomorrow.

11:28.352 --> 11:29.187
Molly?

11:33.291 --> 11:35.458
Dave's gonna write his book.

11:35.460 --> 11:38.361
We're gonna make some money
and renovate this place.

11:38.363 --> 11:41.363
Maybe you'll even
have your own room.

11:41.365 --> 11:42.632
Right.

11:42.634 --> 11:45.901
I want you to
remember this, okay?

11:45.903 --> 11:50.274
Heather's been through a lot
for a little girl her age.

11:52.744 --> 11:56.380
You know what it's
like to lose a parent.

11:58.982 --> 12:01.651
You know how much
you've struggled.

12:01.653 --> 12:04.556
It hasn't been easy
for her either.

12:08.659 --> 12:11.560
I just need you to be
the big sister, okay?

12:17.368 --> 12:18.566
Hello?

12:25.543 --> 12:27.475
Where are you guys?

12:41.625 --> 12:45.596
Mrs.
Birkin, my 1st grade teacher.

12:49.933 --> 12:52.703
In memory of RM and MM, 1886.

12:55.373 --> 12:57.706
Hey Molly, Mr. Simmonds
says the church

12:57.708 --> 12:59.608
was built in the 1800s.

12:59.610 --> 13:00.675
Great.

13:00.677 --> 13:04.546
Some of these graves
are almost 200 years old.

13:04.548 --> 13:05.917
We have a neighbor.

13:14.591 --> 13:16.995
Susanna Berry, June 10th, 1832.

13:18.562 --> 13:20.429
Why is there a lamb there?

13:20.431 --> 13:22.397
For a child.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.132
They didn't have
medicine back then.

13:24.134 --> 13:27.402
Measles, chickenpox,
scarlet fever,

13:27.404 --> 13:29.104
that's what killed the children.

13:29.106 --> 13:30.308
Fires too.

13:33.076 --> 13:35.614
Her mother died in a fire.

13:38.515 --> 13:39.918
What are you doing?

13:43.653 --> 13:44.719
Seriously,
you guys shouldn't be

13:44.721 --> 13:46.655
messing with graves.

13:46.657 --> 13:48.994
Molly, you gotta see this.

13:51.863 --> 13:53.695
That's strange.

13:53.697 --> 13:55.498
What's strange?

13:55.500 --> 13:57.900
Impossible to
bury someone here.

13:57.902 --> 13:59.568
Why is that?

13:59.570 --> 14:00.739
Too many roots.

14:03.006 --> 14:04.406
H.E.H.

14:04.408 --> 14:05.744
Just initials.

14:07.812 --> 14:09.815
Those are my initials.

14:11.783 --> 14:14.019
Your initials are H.E.H.?

14:15.753 --> 14:18.020
Come on,
guys, let's go.

14:18.022 --> 14:19.121
Come on,

14:19.123 --> 14:20.522
you kids shouldn't be
playing around here anyway.

14:33.004 --> 14:35.606
You're not alone.

14:47.652 --> 14:49.785
You never told me there'd
be a bunch of dead people

14:49.787 --> 14:51.690
buried in our backyard.

14:53.624 --> 14:54.489
Dave!

14:54.491 --> 14:55.126
What?

14:56.561 --> 14:58.761
We found a graveyard
by the woods.

14:58.763 --> 15:00.061
I'm writing.

15:00.063 --> 15:01.699
Did you guys know?

15:03.801 --> 15:05.233
Well did you?

15:05.235 --> 15:07.902
A lot of old churches had
graveyards on the property.

15:07.904 --> 15:10.138
Seriously,
dead people?

15:10.140 --> 15:13.745
Imagine what quack
neighbors there'll be.

15:18.249 --> 15:21.116
What
happens when people die?

15:21.118 --> 15:23.685
Does a part of you live forever

15:23.687 --> 15:27.656
or is it just like going to
sleep and never waking up?

15:27.658 --> 15:30.059
Since dad, I think
a lot about death,

15:30.061 --> 15:32.661
but it's strange when it's
the death of a little girl.

15:32.663 --> 15:35.200
Where do you
think her body is?

15:38.635 --> 15:40.603
Whose body?

15:40.605 --> 15:41.740
The dead girl.

15:45.743 --> 15:47.846
The one in the graveyard.

15:48.946 --> 15:52.017
She has the same
initials as me, H.E.H.

15:57.788 --> 16:00.289
Don't you think that's strange?

16:00.291 --> 16:04.225
No, it's probably
just a coincidence.

16:04.227 --> 16:07.765
I don't think you
should worry about it.

16:17.240 --> 16:20.843
My heart was
pounding just at the thought.

16:20.845 --> 16:23.715
What if they'd been my initials?

16:29.287 --> 16:30.555
Hey, Molly.

16:33.256 --> 16:35.056
Wanna go to the store with me?

16:35.058 --> 16:38.762
Paper and pens are a
writer's best friend.

16:44.902 --> 16:46.504
Thanks.

17:18.035 --> 17:19.167
Hi.

17:19.170 --> 17:20.603
Good day.

17:20.605 --> 17:22.304
Would you have
any carbon paper?

17:22.306 --> 17:23.372
Sure thing, sir.

17:23.374 --> 17:24.839
How many boxes would you like?

17:24.842 --> 17:26.874
Three boxes, 100 sheets.

17:26.876 --> 17:27.809
Okay.

17:27.810 --> 17:28.812
Thank you.

18:04.781 --> 18:08.953
So far, living
here is worse than I imagined.

18:10.988 --> 18:15.059
Mom and Dave aren't exactly
your typical parents.

18:16.259 --> 18:20.028
As long as we turn up
for meals and bedtime,

18:20.030 --> 18:22.131
they don't worry
too much about us.

18:32.242 --> 18:36.615
♪ Into the trees ♪

19:22.326 --> 19:23.995
Mommy!

19:32.403 --> 19:33.901
You awake?

19:33.903 --> 19:37.174
Do you not see me
sitting at my desk?

19:38.509 --> 19:40.010
We need to talk.

19:43.079 --> 19:44.747
It's possible, isn't it?

19:44.749 --> 19:46.684
Maybe a crossed signal?

19:47.884 --> 19:50.451
It could've been a
voice from the radio.

19:50.453 --> 19:52.153
Probably.

19:52.155 --> 19:54.224
I'm not making this up.

19:58.362 --> 19:59.862
Do you want a sip?

19:59.864 --> 20:01.865
I'm not drinking that.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.002
Is that Dave's?

20:11.407 --> 20:12.341
What's wrong with you?

20:12.343 --> 20:13.941
There was a newspaper article

20:13.943 --> 20:17.112
about a missing
girl at the store.

20:17.114 --> 20:21.219
I asked the guy and he
said they never found her.

20:22.286 --> 20:24.119
Mom's right.

20:24.121 --> 20:27.125
You should give
this place a chance.

20:28.092 --> 20:29.494
I'm going to bed.

20:33.263 --> 20:35.933
Stop worrying about dead people.

21:03.259 --> 21:04.359
Molly!

21:04.361 --> 21:06.030
Molly!

21:10.366 --> 21:11.199
Over here!

21:11.201 --> 21:13.203
Over here.

21:33.022 --> 21:34.122
Come this way.

21:34.124 --> 21:36.024
This way!

22:16.400 --> 22:18.069
Helen?

22:22.006 --> 22:24.909
Where are you, my
little butterfly?

23:07.684 --> 23:09.183
You kids come
straight home after school,

23:09.185 --> 23:11.054
- all right?
- Thanks.

23:12.990 --> 23:14.690
You moved
here from Baltimore?

23:14.692 --> 23:15.524
Yes.

23:15.526 --> 23:16.658
Here to
your old church.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.325
Right.

23:17.327 --> 23:18.360
Yeah.

23:18.362 --> 23:20.696
And you're gonna renovate it.

23:20.698 --> 23:23.398
If I understand correctly,
you are a writer?

23:23.400 --> 23:24.466
Yeah.

23:24.468 --> 23:26.000
What do you write?

23:26.002 --> 23:27.501
Fiction.

23:27.503 --> 23:29.039
Fiction, novels.

23:31.008 --> 23:31.672
How's that going?

24:00.203 --> 24:02.336
Kind of hard to
talk to anyone about anything

24:02.338 --> 24:05.140
when no one believes you.

24:05.142 --> 24:07.711
Am I hearing voices
now like dad?

24:08.578 --> 24:11.145
I saw a little girl in my dream.

24:11.147 --> 24:13.382
It's more than just visions now.

24:13.384 --> 24:15.720
I feel it, and it scares me.

24:22.226 --> 24:25.227
I feel like something
is watching us out here.

24:25.229 --> 24:27.261
Seems to be everywhere,

24:27.263 --> 24:30.434
around the house,
the woods, the wind.

24:32.068 --> 24:35.036
I think Heather feels it too.

25:04.634 --> 25:06.237
You can come out.

25:07.438 --> 25:09.805
I'm not gonna hurt you.

25:21.751 --> 25:23.086
Don't be afraid.

25:24.288 --> 25:26.524
I brought you some flowers.

25:46.276 --> 25:48.677
Kitty was right in the
middle of the action.

26:04.528 --> 26:07.863
Do you want to
come to my house and play?

26:07.865 --> 26:11.165
You won't have to
be alone anymore.

26:11.167 --> 26:12.667
Don't worry.

26:12.669 --> 26:14.736
I'll be your friend.

26:14.738 --> 26:17.706
I'll be your best
friend forever.

26:17.708 --> 26:19.274
Don't make a big
deal out of it.

26:19.276 --> 26:21.209
She probably just has
an imaginary friend.

26:21.211 --> 26:23.812
No, I saw something.

26:23.814 --> 26:25.182
I'm not crazy.

26:27.217 --> 26:31.219
She was staring at it and then
she turned and looked at me,

26:31.221 --> 26:34.221
as if whatever it was
told her I was there.

26:34.223 --> 26:35.559
Molly, please.

26:36.759 --> 26:38.893
I know what you're thinking.

26:38.895 --> 26:42.163
I'm thinking I should've
taken a bigger piece of pie.

26:42.165 --> 26:44.734
Look, I'm not making this up.

26:46.702 --> 26:48.306
I'm not like dad.

26:49.173 --> 26:51.206
I didn't say that.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.743
You're thinking it.

26:55.746 --> 26:56.577
Maybe this...

26:57.413 --> 26:58.849
Whoa.

27:01.317 --> 27:03.520
What are you talking about?

27:05.221 --> 27:06.621
What are you talking about?

27:06.623 --> 27:07.588
Nothing!

27:07.590 --> 27:08.923
Dave should get you
one of those collars

27:08.925 --> 27:10.427
with a bell on it.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.307
Heather!

27:57.941 --> 27:58.873
Come with me.

28:09.952 --> 28:12.522
Where are we going?

28:41.518 --> 28:42.353
Heather!

28:49.393 --> 28:50.959
Heather, what's going on?

28:50.961 --> 28:54.828
Come on,
don't let her stop you.

28:58.000 --> 29:00.067
Heather, stop screaming.

29:00.069 --> 29:01.870
Heather, stop!

29:01.872 --> 29:02.770
Stop screaming!

29:02.772 --> 29:04.572
Heather, stop!

29:04.574 --> 29:06.440
What's going on?

29:08.679 --> 29:10.644
What happened?

29:10.646 --> 29:11.915
I don't know!

29:17.054 --> 29:19.988
It sounds like she
was just sleepwalking.

29:19.990 --> 29:21.588
Kids do that sometimes
and they wake up,

29:21.590 --> 29:23.424
they have no idea
where they are.

29:23.426 --> 29:24.392
What's going on?

29:24.394 --> 29:25.226
I've never seen her like this.

29:25.228 --> 29:27.461
She was obviously
sleepwalking.

29:27.463 --> 29:28.796
I tried to wake her up.

29:28.798 --> 29:30.334
What happened?

29:32.001 --> 29:35.172
Came in, she was
talking to someone.

29:39.041 --> 29:43.111
I turned and there
was something outside.

29:43.113 --> 29:46.347
Jesus, did you put this
idea in Heather's head?

29:46.349 --> 29:47.349
No!

29:47.351 --> 29:49.450
What is wrong with you, Molly?

29:49.452 --> 29:50.785
What does this
have to do with me?

29:50.787 --> 29:51.986
I don't know, you tell me.

29:51.988 --> 29:53.455
You think it's normal to be up

29:53.457 --> 29:55.556
in the middle of
the night with her?

29:55.558 --> 29:56.690
What were you doing, Molly?

29:56.692 --> 29:57.624
Stop!

29:57.626 --> 30:00.394
Just leave Heather alone.

30:00.396 --> 30:01.863
Back off!

30:01.865 --> 30:02.997
Leave her alone.

30:02.999 --> 30:03.898
She's a fragile kid.

30:03.900 --> 30:05.132
How would you know?

30:05.134 --> 30:09.136
You left her rotting in that
stupid center for three years!

30:09.138 --> 30:10.404
No one believes me!

30:10.406 --> 30:11.975
It's always my fault!

30:27.057 --> 30:28.659
Hey, baby.

30:31.928 --> 30:33.764
Take your pills, okay?

30:35.132 --> 30:37.000
I don't want them.

30:40.403 --> 30:44.342
I'll leave them here
in case you can't sleep.

31:00.690 --> 31:01.525
I'm sorry.

31:08.765 --> 31:12.937
When we found this place, I
thought it was gonna be perfect.

31:16.873 --> 31:19.477
Maybe it would help us move on,

31:21.944 --> 31:24.077
help you to move on.

31:24.079 --> 31:27.518
Mom, I really wanna
be alone right now.

31:31.520 --> 31:32.155
Okay.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.062
I love you.

32:04.253 --> 32:07.957
Heather, please don't
play with the brush.

32:16.665 --> 32:17.664
Heather!

32:24.807 --> 32:25.643
Hello?

32:26.643 --> 32:27.978
Hey there, Mark.

32:29.112 --> 32:30.948
Yeah, it's going well.

32:32.582 --> 32:33.515
Yes.

32:33.517 --> 32:35.249
Finally just got started.

32:41.223 --> 32:43.725
Okay, yeah, sure, I'll get him.

32:43.727 --> 32:45.093
Hey Dave!

32:45.095 --> 32:46.227
What?

32:46.229 --> 32:48.032
It's your editor.

32:49.566 --> 32:52.033
Heather, please don't touch!

32:52.035 --> 32:53.535
I've told you not to touch!

32:53.537 --> 32:56.039
You can look, but don't touch!

33:02.311 --> 33:04.879
Molly, can you make
sure she's okay?

33:04.881 --> 33:05.716
Fine!

33:11.988 --> 33:13.490
That's your job.

33:16.125 --> 33:17.959
Well screw them, find
another publisher then.

34:44.313 --> 34:46.317
Wait for me!

34:48.851 --> 34:49.916
Wait!

34:49.918 --> 34:50.920
Helen, wait!

34:56.259 --> 34:57.325
Am I getting warmer?

35:01.965 --> 35:03.233
What about now?

35:06.369 --> 35:07.204
Really?

35:08.804 --> 35:09.639
And now?

35:12.409 --> 35:13.309
I found it!

35:20.349 --> 35:21.184
I love it.

35:22.385 --> 35:23.621
It's beautiful!

35:28.190 --> 35:29.359
Can I keep it?

35:30.893 --> 35:31.728
Really?

35:35.431 --> 35:37.967
Did your mom give it to you?

35:54.851 --> 35:56.416
Hey.

35:56.418 --> 35:58.052
What is this?

35:58.054 --> 35:59.186
It's a walkie.

35:59.188 --> 36:01.755
I'm talking to you, Molly.

36:01.757 --> 36:03.023
Do you know how much I paid

36:03.025 --> 36:04.958
for this thing you
just had to have?

36:04.960 --> 36:07.394
You can have it, because
I don't want it anymore.

36:07.396 --> 36:09.400
Hey, I'm not finished!

36:10.432 --> 36:11.798
What?

36:11.800 --> 36:13.967
What is wrong with you?

36:13.969 --> 36:15.438
I hate this place!

36:16.405 --> 36:18.940
I don't wanna live here!

36:18.942 --> 36:20.474
I hate her, I hate him,

36:20.476 --> 36:24.681
and I hate you for forcing
us to live with them!

36:26.081 --> 36:28.719
I wanna go back to Baltimore!

37:04.987 --> 37:07.554
How was
everybody's day?

37:07.556 --> 37:10.891
There's ruins of a
house deep in the woods.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.360
A house?

37:12.362 --> 37:14.494
Yeah, next to a river.

37:14.496 --> 37:18.800
The place looks like
it's about to collapse.

37:18.802 --> 37:21.369
I really don't think Heather
should be playing down there.

37:21.371 --> 37:22.237
Heather?

37:22.239 --> 37:24.171
Why would Heather
be playing there?

37:24.173 --> 37:26.139
She found it.

37:26.141 --> 37:29.911
How about you girls
stick around the church?

37:29.913 --> 37:32.012
Yeah, I agree with that.

37:32.014 --> 37:34.816
I could go check it
out, make sure it's safe.

37:34.818 --> 37:36.918
Mm-mm, that's
not gonna happen.

37:36.920 --> 37:38.489
It's not dangerous.

37:40.123 --> 37:41.555
It's pretty.

37:41.557 --> 37:44.391
I don't want you
playing by the river.

37:44.393 --> 37:45.892
Why don't you show
them that nice locket

37:45.894 --> 37:47.230
you found there?

37:49.097 --> 37:50.366
Let's see it.

37:51.266 --> 37:52.769
Let's have a look.

38:00.275 --> 38:02.543
Do you know they use to
keep old photos inside,

38:02.545 --> 38:03.514
locks of hair?

38:35.878 --> 38:36.947
I hate you.

38:39.481 --> 38:41.851
What are you doing here?

38:42.518 --> 38:43.554
Get out!

38:45.355 --> 38:49.025
Because of you, she
might never come back.

38:54.063 --> 38:56.130
She's very mad you followed us.

39:05.440 --> 39:07.577
Who are you talking about?

39:10.079 --> 39:10.914
Helen.

39:17.353 --> 39:18.521
Who's Helen?

39:21.523 --> 39:23.492
Heather, who's Helen?

39:25.460 --> 39:27.463
You know who Helen is.

39:36.306 --> 39:39.639
Tell me
what she says to you.

39:39.641 --> 39:41.210
What does she want?

39:44.347 --> 39:46.583
Leave us alone.

40:54.016 --> 40:56.953
Well, look what
the wind blew in.

40:59.054 --> 41:03.159
Does Helen have something
to do with the missing girl?

41:10.032 --> 41:12.298
It was only a matter of time.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.471
You would sense something.

41:16.239 --> 41:18.639
I knew the second I saw you.

41:18.641 --> 41:19.643
Knew what?

41:20.675 --> 41:22.679
That you were special.

41:23.813 --> 41:27.351
You have the gift, like
my late wife, Rose.

41:28.418 --> 41:29.583
She claimed that there were

41:29.585 --> 41:32.121
two kinds of people
in this world,

41:34.056 --> 41:37.624
one kind who would
walk into a place

41:37.626 --> 41:38.758
and see it for what it is,

41:38.760 --> 41:40.563
that used to be me,

41:42.731 --> 41:46.766
and the other who
would sense something

41:46.768 --> 41:49.772
that the first group
was unaware of.

41:53.509 --> 41:57.179
Sometimes they would
sense something joyful.

42:01.451 --> 42:05.389
Most times, they would
sense something painful,

42:08.657 --> 42:12.261
like a deep sadness,
like Helen's spirit.

42:15.264 --> 42:18.268
Rose used to call
it the unresolved.

42:22.304 --> 42:25.474
It was if an old
energy from the place

42:27.643 --> 42:30.679
would connect with
something within her

42:32.715 --> 42:34.751
and would draw her in.

42:36.219 --> 42:40.554
I used to think she was
crazy, talking to ghosts,

42:40.556 --> 42:43.726
helping people with
that gift of hers.

42:46.628 --> 42:48.297
She sure meant well.

42:55.371 --> 42:57.307
What happened to her?

42:59.742 --> 43:03.547
Sometimes it can turn
into such silly games,

43:04.679 --> 43:05.815
forbidden games.

43:10.820 --> 43:14.224
I think there's a
reason why I see her,

43:16.458 --> 43:19.295
like I'm supposed
to do something.

43:21.597 --> 43:24.197
Then be very careful.

43:24.199 --> 43:27.136
I don't want you
to end up missing.

43:53.329 --> 43:55.628
This miniature orchestra
consists of two symbols...

43:55.630 --> 43:56.863
Michael!

43:56.865 --> 43:59.833
Michael, come on,
come on, hurry up!

43:59.835 --> 44:02.869
It says, "Leave us alone," look.

44:02.871 --> 44:04.340
It's not there.

44:05.641 --> 44:07.941
There was something
written in the mirror!

44:07.943 --> 44:08.876
There's nothing there.

44:08.878 --> 44:10.911
No, I'm not making this up!

44:10.913 --> 44:15.416
It said, "Leave us alone,"
right in the mirror!

44:15.418 --> 44:16.883
Michael!

44:16.885 --> 44:18.619
This is
getting ridiculous, Molly.

44:36.706 --> 44:37.637
Heather!

44:48.251 --> 44:50.921
Where do you think you're going?

44:57.927 --> 44:59.829
Let's go back to bed.

45:12.907 --> 45:14.675
You
might have a point.

45:14.677 --> 45:17.914
Even if there is some
invisible terror...

45:22.952 --> 45:24.985
Helen!

45:43.438 --> 45:47.610
Helen, are you out here?

45:49.644 --> 45:51.311
Right here.

45:57.619 --> 45:58.918
Helen.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.968
Dad?

46:13.902 --> 46:17.737
Have you considered that
this might all be in your head?

46:17.739 --> 46:19.972
What's that supposed to mean?

46:19.974 --> 46:23.510
Illusions, nightmares, they
wouldn't be what they were

46:23.512 --> 46:25.615
if they didn't seem real.

46:27.048 --> 46:30.050
Sometimes our mind
plays tricks on us.

46:30.052 --> 46:32.489
We see what we want to see.

46:33.889 --> 46:36.789
Maybe you're obsessed with death
because dad killed himself.

46:36.791 --> 46:37.825
He was sick.

46:37.827 --> 46:38.928
You're not.

46:42.965 --> 46:43.963
You were too young.

46:43.965 --> 46:45.798
That's why you don't care.

46:45.800 --> 46:46.967
I never said I didn't care.

46:46.969 --> 46:51.441
I just won't allow him to
poison the rest of my life.

46:53.108 --> 46:53.942
Whoa.

46:55.110 --> 46:58.144
That's
where I saw the ghost.

46:58.146 --> 46:59.847
I'll be right back.

46:59.849 --> 47:01.548
Hey wait!

47:01.550 --> 47:03.751
Don't go in there!

47:03.753 --> 47:05.889
I just wanted you to see it!

47:09.525 --> 47:11.791
I'm staying right here.

47:11.793 --> 47:13.562
You should come back.

47:17.400 --> 47:18.034
Wow.

47:19.969 --> 47:22.105
Michael Summers, Fall, 1982.

47:24.072 --> 47:26.942
Exploring some mysterious ruins,

47:31.614 --> 47:33.914
and crossing the threshold.

47:43.793 --> 47:46.927
Looks like some teenagers
from Hallowell came down here.

47:46.929 --> 47:48.030
Maybe bums.

47:49.532 --> 47:50.900
But alas, no ghost.

48:00.009 --> 48:02.008
What are you doing?

48:02.010 --> 48:04.644
I thought
I heard something.

48:04.646 --> 48:06.813
What do you
mean you heard something?

48:06.815 --> 48:07.981
Heard what?

48:07.983 --> 48:09.385
Wait!

48:13.222 --> 48:14.924
Michael!

48:16.659 --> 48:17.559
Be careful!

48:19.695 --> 48:21.564
What is this?

48:25.634 --> 48:28.471
Please
get out of there!

48:31.639 --> 48:32.474
Michael!

48:36.077 --> 48:36.980
What is it?

48:38.047 --> 48:39.545
Look at the initials,

48:39.547 --> 48:41.648
the same as on the
stone in the graveyard.

48:41.650 --> 48:42.485
Helen.

48:43.485 --> 48:45.487
This is where she lived.

48:47.255 --> 48:49.789
Heather said her name was Helen.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.525
Here, H.E.H.

48:51.527 --> 48:54.728
H doesn't mean
her name was Helen.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.029
They're all underwater?

50:04.699 --> 50:05.534
Oh really?

50:10.940 --> 50:12.675
No sound, just music.

50:35.130 --> 50:36.833
I like your dress.

50:37.865 --> 50:40.168
I don't have any nice dresses.

50:52.715 --> 50:54.017
Can I go with you?

50:58.019 --> 51:01.787
Sometimes she
sleeps on the couch.

51:01.789 --> 51:03.192
She won't see us.

51:04.393 --> 51:05.925
We could go tonight.

51:42.764 --> 51:44.701
Molly, I know it's you!

51:46.434 --> 51:48.668
You better let me out.

52:36.918 --> 52:37.918
How did this happen?

52:37.920 --> 52:39.288
She locked me in.

52:56.838 --> 52:58.204
Can I help you?

52:58.206 --> 53:01.108
We're looking for
Hallowell ancestries.

53:01.110 --> 53:04.144
I did find something
else that might be helpful.

53:04.146 --> 53:06.015
Let me just see now.

53:08.483 --> 53:10.217
According to this,

53:10.219 --> 53:13.722
the house burned down
about 100 years ago.

53:15.224 --> 53:20.193
This is a picture of the
house before it burned.

53:20.195 --> 53:22.996
Does it look familiar to the
other house, do you think?

53:22.998 --> 53:26.032
It kind of looks like it.

53:26.034 --> 53:28.400
Oh, and here's a
picture of the owners.

53:28.402 --> 53:31.771
This would be Mr.
and Mrs. Miller.

53:31.773 --> 53:35.141
You see,
the last name's Miller.

53:35.143 --> 53:39.314
This one, Mabel, Robert
and Mabel's girl, Helen,

53:42.117 --> 53:45.021
taken in June 1886
at Harper House.

53:48.157 --> 53:51.858
The estate belong to
Mr. and Mrs. Harper.

53:51.860 --> 53:55.498
Mr. Harper passed away,
and shortly afterward,

53:56.898 --> 53:59.801
Mrs. Harper married
Mr. Robert Miller.

54:02.237 --> 54:04.271
Then the girl's
name was Helen Harper.

54:04.273 --> 54:07.374
Yes, Helen Elizabeth Harper.

54:07.376 --> 54:09.479
Fire at the Harper House.

54:10.813 --> 54:13.979
The bodies of Helen,
Mabel, and Robert Miller

54:13.981 --> 54:15.217
were never found.

54:17.518 --> 54:20.387
They must have burned to ashes.

54:20.389 --> 54:21.390
Poor things.

54:22.891 --> 54:23.893
Thank you.

54:26.394 --> 54:27.327
Where
are you going?

54:27.329 --> 54:28.397
What's wrong?

54:30.965 --> 54:32.999
Wow, H.E.H.

54:33.001 --> 54:34.934
The girl in
the picture, that's her,

54:34.936 --> 54:37.304
that's the girl I
saw in my dream.

54:37.306 --> 54:39.338
I told you Heather knew
her name was Helen.

54:39.340 --> 54:40.574
There
must be an explanation

54:40.576 --> 54:43.211
other than she's
talking to ghosts.

54:47.849 --> 54:49.615
I told mom I'd
meet them in town.

54:49.617 --> 54:50.583
I'll see you later.

55:23.318 --> 55:24.220
Hey guys?

55:46.474 --> 55:50.276
What
happened to Helen?

55:50.278 --> 55:52.315
Why is she still here?

55:55.317 --> 55:56.615
What if she lured these girls

55:56.617 --> 55:59.422
because she didn't
wanna be alone?

56:00.554 --> 56:02.557
Where did she take them?

56:10.465 --> 56:13.335
♪ Ramblin' Rose

56:17.204 --> 56:19.875
♪ Ramblin' Rose

56:22.244 --> 56:25.014

57:57.239 --> 57:58.704
Go back to the car
and lock the doors.

57:58.706 --> 57:59.507
Molly?

58:01.076 --> 58:01.711
Molly?

58:14.489 --> 58:15.324
Molly!

58:17.692 --> 58:18.527
Molly!

58:24.132 --> 58:27.300
She's not here,
I can't find her.

58:27.302 --> 58:28.534
Dave!

58:28.536 --> 58:30.637
I'd better not
see her right now.

58:30.639 --> 58:32.438
What are you saying?

58:32.440 --> 58:34.139
She didn't do this!

58:34.141 --> 58:35.407
Then who did?

58:35.409 --> 58:37.142
She's not well, Jean.

58:37.144 --> 58:39.646
You just don't see it, do you?

58:39.648 --> 58:42.251
You Molly Summers' parents?

58:44.686 --> 58:49.521
I took her back to the station
and she didn't say much,

58:49.523 --> 58:53.492
except she didn't
wanna come back here.

58:53.494 --> 58:55.096
She seemed upset.

58:57.132 --> 58:58.530
Is everything all right?

58:58.532 --> 58:59.465
Yes, it's fine.

58:59.467 --> 59:02.469
Obviously we got broken into.

59:02.471 --> 59:05.173
We don't get break-ins here.

59:07.442 --> 59:09.508
Okay, officer, what's
that supposed to mean?

59:09.510 --> 59:10.476
I don't get it.

59:25.193 --> 59:25.828
Get out.

59:26.827 --> 59:27.663
Now!

59:44.445 --> 59:48.548
Michael
Summers, Fall, 1982.

59:48.550 --> 59:50.186
Exploring some...

01:00:13.942 --> 01:00:15.608
Maybe bums.

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.278
But alas, no ghosts.

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:23.449
Helen,
open the door!

01:00:31.693 --> 01:00:34.630
It's
ruined, all of it.

01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:52.478
Your mother said
your sister had

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.648
some pretty intense
panic attacks,

01:00:55.650 --> 01:00:59.251
even hallucinations
after your father died.

01:00:59.253 --> 01:01:01.920
She ever do anything like this?

01:01:01.922 --> 01:01:04.692
She would never
touch my stuff.

01:01:10.565 --> 01:01:12.965
I think there's something
going on in this house.

01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:15.703
None of us are
willing to say it.

01:01:23.510 --> 01:01:25.847
Get this place cleaned up.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:23.001
I am so tired, Molly!

01:02:23.003 --> 01:02:25.505
I'm so tired of all of this!

01:02:25.507 --> 01:02:27.072
I didn't do it!

01:02:27.074 --> 01:02:28.543
Then who did?

01:02:34.449 --> 01:02:36.518
You think I'm like dad.

01:02:43.692 --> 01:02:44.525
You,

01:02:46.827 --> 01:02:49.364
you're not like your father.

01:02:50.664 --> 01:02:53.532
You are nothing
like your father.

01:02:53.534 --> 01:02:55.637
Do you understand that?

01:03:06.648 --> 01:03:09.782
Why don't you
ever talk about him?

01:03:09.784 --> 01:03:11.653
About what happened?

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:20.525
Because I don't
want Michael to know.

01:03:20.527 --> 01:03:22.530
He knows, mom.

01:03:26.867 --> 01:03:31.039
I never stopped loving him
through all his delusions.

01:03:39.146 --> 01:03:40.882
Michael was so young.

01:03:44.885 --> 01:03:48.623
I didn't want him to
have to carry it around.

01:03:56.597 --> 01:04:00.499
I wish you didn't
have to either.

01:04:22.690 --> 01:04:23.858
Get some rest.

01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.213
General,
what's the holdup?

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:24.115
I've gotta report
to headquarters!

01:05:24.117 --> 01:05:25.550
Easy, easy!

01:05:25.552 --> 01:05:27.820
It's not
as simple as we thought.

01:05:27.822 --> 01:05:30.055
The shock-proof container
was damaged on contact.

01:05:30.057 --> 01:05:31.490
We've got a leak inspector.

01:06:54.909 --> 01:06:55.874
That's enough games.

01:06:55.876 --> 01:06:57.778
Let's go, time for bed.

01:07:00.614 --> 01:07:01.250
Helen.

01:07:31.778 --> 01:07:32.947
Dad?

01:07:54.402 --> 01:07:55.237
Molly.

01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:08.650
You can still save her.

01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:13.688
Come to me.

01:08:32.840 --> 01:08:33.875
Oh no!

01:08:43.051 --> 01:08:43.885
Heather!

01:08:45.953 --> 01:08:46.787
Heather!

01:08:52.193 --> 01:08:54.095
Heather, where are you?

01:08:55.162 --> 01:08:55.997
Answer me!

01:08:58.698 --> 01:08:59.799
Heather!

01:09:07.975 --> 01:09:09.407
No no no no no!

01:09:09.408 --> 01:09:10.243
Heather!

01:09:13.046 --> 01:09:13.881
Hey!

01:09:15.983 --> 01:09:17.148
Where is she?

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:19.884
What did you do to my sister?

01:09:19.886 --> 01:09:20.988
Let her go!

01:09:22.023 --> 01:09:23.388
Heather!

01:10:11.439 --> 01:10:12.274
Helen?

01:10:17.043 --> 01:10:17.878
Helen?

01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:22.117
Helen?

01:10:23.984 --> 01:10:26.921
Where are you, my
little butterfly?

01:10:29.090 --> 01:10:30.089
Hello?

01:10:42.936 --> 01:10:45.937
Helen, are you still up here?

01:10:46.573 --> 01:10:48.042
Helen, bedtime.

01:10:49.210 --> 01:10:51.811
No more hide and seek.

01:11:00.555 --> 01:11:01.389
Helen?

01:11:06.894 --> 01:11:07.929
Helen?

01:11:10.864 --> 01:11:12.998
I bet I know where you are.

01:11:27.948 --> 01:11:29.283
I win!

01:11:46.434 --> 01:11:47.969
Helen!

01:11:49.936 --> 01:11:51.870
Helen, open the door!

01:11:51.872 --> 01:11:53.873
If you can,
please open the door!

01:11:53.875 --> 01:11:55.109
Mama!

01:11:58.078 --> 01:11:59.079
Mama!

01:12:00.113 --> 01:12:02.447
Helen,
there's a latch!

01:12:02.449 --> 01:12:04.085
Unlatch the door!

01:12:06.453 --> 01:12:07.919
There's a latch.

01:12:07.921 --> 01:12:08.956
Helen, come on!

01:12:11.425 --> 01:12:13.195
I'm trying!

01:12:14.561 --> 01:12:15.928
Mama!

01:12:15.930 --> 01:12:17.963
Helen, please
unlock this door!

01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:21.200
Helen!

01:12:21.202 --> 01:12:22.968
Helen!

01:12:22.970 --> 01:12:23.804
Mama!

01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.941
Come here
and open the door.

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:30.409
I'm trying.

01:12:30.411 --> 01:12:32.977
Open the door, Helen!

01:12:32.979 --> 01:12:35.013
Mama!

01:12:35.015 --> 01:12:35.647
Helen!

01:12:35.649 --> 01:12:37.016
Mommy!

01:12:37.018 --> 01:12:40.085
Helen, open the door!

01:12:48.496 --> 01:12:49.661
Heather!

01:12:49.663 --> 01:12:51.032
Heather, stop!

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:54.034
Heather!

01:12:56.002 --> 01:12:57.169
Heather, stop!

01:12:57.171 --> 01:12:58.236
Heather!

01:13:55.195 --> 01:13:56.628
Crap!

01:13:56.630 --> 01:13:58.162
Heather, please breathe!

01:13:58.164 --> 01:13:59.134
Heather, no!

01:14:00.134 --> 01:14:01.500
Heather, no!

01:14:01.502 --> 01:14:03.602
Heather, don't do this to me!

01:14:03.604 --> 01:14:06.138
Heather, please breathe!

01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:07.772
Wake up, Heather!

01:14:07.774 --> 01:14:09.308
Come on, get up!

01:14:09.310 --> 01:14:10.608
Please get up!

01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:11.445
Come on!

01:14:13.514 --> 01:14:14.412
Wake up.

01:14:14.414 --> 01:14:15.647
Oh my god!

01:14:15.649 --> 01:14:16.615
Heather!

01:14:16.617 --> 01:14:18.186
Oh my god, Heather!

01:14:23.457 --> 01:14:24.526
Are you okay?

01:14:25.525 --> 01:14:27.026
My ocean!

01:14:27.028 --> 01:14:27.659
No, Heather, stop!

01:14:29.130 --> 01:14:29.965
Stop!

01:14:30.631 --> 01:14:32.231
No!

01:14:32.233 --> 01:14:33.201
No, let me go!

01:14:34.135 --> 01:14:35.170
Let me go!

01:14:47.747 --> 01:14:51.118
Heather,
I don't understand.

01:14:55.823 --> 01:14:57.659
I wanna go with her!

01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:02.193
What are you talking about?

01:15:02.195 --> 01:15:04.765
I don't wanna
be alone anymore!

01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:12.407
I don't wanna be here.

01:15:16.143 --> 01:15:18.579
She's the only one who cares.

01:15:21.082 --> 01:15:25.253
When my dad finds out what I
did, he's gonna send me back.

01:15:28.788 --> 01:15:31.059
Heather, what happened?

01:15:35.529 --> 01:15:37.265
It was an accident.

01:15:40.835 --> 01:15:43.238
I was trying to cook for her.

01:15:47.841 --> 01:15:50.344
I thought the fire would stop,

01:15:52.445 --> 01:15:53.614
but it didn't.

01:15:56.182 --> 01:15:57.519
I was so scared.

01:15:58.786 --> 01:15:59.654
I just ran.

01:16:00.753 --> 01:16:02.590
The house burned down.

01:16:03.524 --> 01:16:05.126
She never came out.

01:16:09.430 --> 01:16:11.199
Her parents are dead.

01:16:12.166 --> 01:16:13.168
She's alone.

01:16:15.502 --> 01:16:18.206
That's why she understands me.

01:16:19.140 --> 01:16:21.240
She never meant to hurt
her parents either.

01:16:29.283 --> 01:16:31.817
We need to help
her if we want her to stop!

01:16:45.298 --> 01:16:46.764
It's somewhere here.

01:16:46.766 --> 01:16:48.799
We gotta find it!

01:16:48.801 --> 01:16:52.473
I think Helen's parents
are trapped in here.

01:16:54.942 --> 01:16:56.808
We have to set them free!

01:16:56.810 --> 01:16:57.645
Come on!

01:17:01.181 --> 01:17:02.750
Come on, push harder!

01:17:06.554 --> 01:17:07.489
Over there!

01:17:10.823 --> 01:17:12.259
Here, underneath!

01:17:17.698 --> 01:17:18.867
It was locked!

01:17:20.201 --> 01:17:20.835
Help me!

01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:27.175
Careful.

01:17:32.779 --> 01:17:36.317
Wait here until I see
what's down there.

01:18:05.011 --> 01:18:06.713
Molly?

01:18:07.614 --> 01:18:09.283
Do you see anything?

01:18:11.284 --> 01:18:12.353
Are you okay?

01:18:14.721 --> 01:18:15.556
Heather!

01:18:16.523 --> 01:18:18.293
You have to see this!

01:18:24.265 --> 01:18:24.899
It's them.

01:18:31.438 --> 01:18:32.774
Helen's parents.

01:18:34.108 --> 01:18:37.375
Their spirits must've been trapped
down here since the fire.

01:19:11.444 --> 01:19:12.777
What's happening?

01:19:22.422 --> 01:19:25.389
Come on, Molly, we
need to get out.

01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:58.123
Whoa!

01:19:58.125 --> 01:19:59.558
You gotta be kidding me!

01:20:14.475 --> 01:20:16.474
Goodbye, Helen.
