06:10.731 --> 06:12.722
Hello there!

06:13.691 --> 06:17.001
Hi, vesla. Do you want candy?

06:17.091 --> 06:20.800
- Do you have a guy?
- Have something else you can smoke.

06:21.011 --> 06:23.525
Thin on you, I smoke.

06:31.291 --> 06:34.886
- Can I have a seat?
- Have a train ever?

07:45.731 --> 07:49.644
- Can I help them?
- Tullinger. Come on, full tank!

07:49.731 --> 07:52.529
Super, normal or ethyl?

07:56.891 --> 07:59.849
What are you doing? Get away,
I do not want you here.

08:20.531 --> 08:24.126
What the hell is it wrong with you?
"I'm in a hurry, I said!

08:24.211 --> 08:26.884
You are badly in the oil.

08:27.131 --> 08:29.691
Is this how you treat customers?

08:35.051 --> 08:37.519
You are discontinued. Begone.

08:50.411 --> 08:53.721
Up with chin.

10:07.211 --> 10:09.202
What happened?

10:12.851 --> 10:14.523
Looks eaten out.

10:14.651 --> 10:17.882
What is wrong with you?

10:29.331 --> 10:33.769
Where did you get hold of
that scratch?

10:37.132 --> 10:40.841
Want to pay for
the broken headlight?

10:46.732 --> 10:50.441
Want to get your head broken too?

11:12.972 --> 11:17.011
- What is the problem?
- The wreck ruined my headlight.

11:17.092 --> 11:20.209
- Take it easy.
- Go to hell.

11:20.292 --> 11:23.409
What do you think about it?
The driver is the poet.

11:23.572 --> 11:27.531
All right. Come with me
then I'll get you a new smell.

11:30.692 --> 11:32.648
Come on.

12:40.372 --> 12:42.363
What about the smell?

12:42.612 --> 12:44.921
Later. We have something
We are going to make up here.

12:47.292 --> 12:49.965
Do not take it personally.
Have nothing with you to do.

12:50.052 --> 12:52.282
Do you need help?

12:52.372 --> 12:58.766
If someone comes running out,
can you take him

14:09.772 --> 14:13.651
Hey hello, do you want a beer?
- I'm not your mate.

14:13.732 --> 14:17.964
- What are you doing here?
- Shall give you a try.

14:18.052 --> 14:21.488
Are you going to take us all?

14:29.892 --> 14:32.611
Take a break now

14:34.012 --> 14:37.084
See what you did
with him.

14:37.172 --> 14:39.640
That's fine.

14:39.732 --> 14:41.882
Do you think?

16:06.372 --> 16:08.761
Spark into the toe.

17:38.532 --> 17:41.205
I asked you to wait outside.

17:44.252 --> 17:46.208
Where do you act

17:46.292 --> 17:49.170
Here it's closed tonight.

17:49.252 --> 17:51.447
Sorry.

17:58.332 --> 18:03.884
It's my beer. Why do you help?
him? We just got him up.

18:04.572 --> 18:08.087
When I was little wild
I become a nurse.

18:09.492 --> 18:15.203
Do you get the guys to christmas up
each other so you can play sister?

18:17.412 --> 18:20.882
I have a crack in my lip.

18:23.372 --> 18:26.842
A crack in lip, I said.

18:49.212 --> 18:53.046
Buddy, it's not
what it looks like.

18:53.452 --> 18:56.808
You're my crap, right?

18:58.932 --> 19:01.651
You're eaten.

19:02.332 --> 19:04.323
Drive with him.

19:04.412 --> 19:06.721
Your asshole.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.692
We have all our kick,
right?

19:13.493 --> 19:15.848
Hi, Pearl.

19:15.933 --> 19:18.163
Alright, everyone. Then we stick.

19:20.853 --> 19:23.572
Sit close to me
on the bike.

19:30.813 --> 19:34.249
You are not so important to him.
He is sticking with another girl.

19:35.053 --> 19:36.771
But I like you.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.642
Do not do it.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.327
Do you want a ride?

19:46.973 --> 19:50.648
Have no choice.

20:09.293 --> 20:11.727
Come on.

20:43.413 --> 20:46.007
See you later, okay?

20:48.613 --> 20:52.447
Do you like the roller coaster?

20:52.533 --> 20:55.491
- Yes, joe.
- What about you?

20:57.733 --> 21:01.726
How about you, Shill?
Do you like speed?

21:02.293 --> 21:05.285
Yes, I love it.

21:20.293 --> 21:22.727
Come on.

21:53.253 --> 21:56.848
Why should I drive
with the poet?

21:57.173 --> 22:01.849
Pearl sat down with me. And three
on a bike are too many.

22:02.293 --> 22:04.523
I do not think you care about me.

22:04.613 --> 22:09.209
I care about everyone like that
do as I say.

22:09.573 --> 22:16.524
- Go to hell!
- Fits me better than heaven.

22:22.053 --> 22:24.362
- Look up where you go.
- Go to hell!

22:24.493 --> 22:27.371
Shut up.

22:30.813 --> 22:33.486
Sorry, I went in thought.

22:33.573 --> 22:39.170
- Do not sound like an excuse.
- Did anyone hear that he was sad?

22:40.413 --> 22:43.530
Let me hear that.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.604
Not from me, mate.

22:45.693 --> 22:49.003
Give them a carnival dress
they look all the same.

22:49.093 --> 22:51.368
Which fools
are you from?

23:00.453 --> 23:02.011
Hold him!

23:11.813 --> 23:13.565
It's cowardly.

23:13.613 --> 23:16.252
Are you going to join?
Stay away from that.

23:16.773 --> 23:19.241
Is he worth it?

23:47.173 --> 23:50.245
He guy ... the poet?

23:51.533 --> 23:53.649
Yes, is he still there?

23:53.733 --> 23:56.850
Four guests went loose
on him.

23:58.013 --> 24:00.686
Was there four of them?

24:00.733 --> 24:03.452
Did you see the gradient?

24:03.533 --> 24:07.651
One of them had a propeller
with three leaves.

24:07.773 --> 24:10.765
He is a mechanic. I mean
his degree.

24:12.293 --> 24:16.047
We have a nice room all over the park
we find them.

24:57.453 --> 24:59.683
Are they them?

25:22.653 --> 25:25.326
Either they saw that we were coming,
Or they stuck right away.

25:25.413 --> 25:28.211
We stay here for a while and
looking after them anyway.

25:28.293 --> 25:32.081
- How do you feel?
- A little sore in the stomach.

25:32.173 --> 25:34.812
Go over to Shill and relax a little.

25:34.893 --> 25:36.849
I want to be with you
when you find them.

25:36.933 --> 25:38.810
Just do as I say.

25:38.893 --> 25:42.249
Jocko, get started.
Come, let's go.

25:59.093 --> 26:01.402
Should I drive?

26:39.173 --> 26:41.607
Sit down.

26:48.893 --> 26:53.091
Relax she's just
my roommate

27:09.773 --> 27:12.810
You have a wild mouth.

27:16.773 --> 27:19.003
You know what-

27:19.573 --> 27:23.407
I've wanted to kiss you
from the first moment.

27:24.213 --> 27:28.570
Why do you say "Do you know what?"
Low self-esteem?

27:33.013 --> 27:36.289
I have something for you.

27:39.893 --> 27:42.361
Keep it

27:45.974 --> 27:48.090
You're cheeky.

27:48.174 --> 27:51.484
One moment ... and so ...

27:55.174 --> 27:57.608
Really cheeky.

28:08.974 --> 28:12.046
Will you make love to me?

28:13.814 --> 28:16.089
Well?

28:50.694 --> 28:53.527
Do not you want to?

28:53.614 --> 28:57.129
Yes. I will love you.

28:57.214 --> 28:59.364
No thanks.

28:59.454 --> 29:04.209
If you want to do that,
so do it.

29:10.934 --> 29:15.371
Wait. There are some here.

29:15.454 --> 29:18.287
So what?

29:18.494 --> 29:21.008
Let her look.

29:26.774 --> 29:29.288
Sorry.

29:32.734 --> 29:34.929
Is she never talking?

29:35.014 --> 29:37.574
Not as much as you.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.728
Do it now then.

29:44.894 --> 29:47.408
Sorry.

29:49.534 --> 29:55.530
Quite square, what.
Civil morality, right?

30:02.454 --> 30:05.366
Do you have fun?

30:05.574 --> 30:08.008
There are too many of them.

30:08.094 --> 30:11.370
You were not too many
when you took the guy.

30:13.214 --> 30:15.648
Just go to hell.

31:07.294 --> 31:10.525
You killed him.

31:11.294 --> 31:13.364
Let's sting.

31:51.454 --> 31:55.333
Let the door stand up,
I want to see.

31:57.214 --> 32:00.012
Did you find him?
- Yes, we found them.

32:00.094 --> 32:03.404
Did you fix them?
- Yes, fix them properly.

32:05.334 --> 32:08.929
One of them relaxed
too good.

32:10.254 --> 32:14.247
Do not forget that we do not
was there tonight.

32:14.334 --> 32:17.770
Could have been another gang,
but it's just forgetting.

32:17.934 --> 32:21.051
I'll take care of it.

32:28.974 --> 32:32.011
Buddy does not know how lucky
he is.

32:32.774 --> 32:37.802
A girl with your hair
and your body.

32:38.094 --> 32:41.564
Lori, do not start again.

32:44.174 --> 32:47.211
With what?

32:47.574 --> 32:50.134
Nothing, pretty.

32:51.534 --> 32:54.731
Just a little girlfriend.

32:56.454 --> 32:58.649
Same for me.

33:01.974 --> 33:06.684
- They really got what?
- Yes, proper bank.

33:06.774 --> 33:09.811
No one knocks us.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.322
No.

33:13.054 --> 33:17.093
You should see him tonight.
A bit of a fight.

33:17.334 --> 33:20.406
Wish I had
been there.

33:27.294 --> 33:30.092
You're weak for Shill, what?

33:32.974 --> 33:35.966
Yes, I am.

33:36.014 --> 33:40.007
She is awesome.
But she is angry.

33:40.094 --> 33:45.373
One moment, nice and straightforward
and next something else.

33:45.454 --> 33:47.763
Really?

34:27.614 --> 34:31.447
What kind of painter are you?

34:33.574 --> 34:36.884
What kind of painter are you?

34:36.974 --> 34:43.049
Do not know. Doseter, baseballs-
places, arm hooks.

34:43.654 --> 34:46.851
Occasionally self-portraits.

34:46.934 --> 34:52.054
- Yes?
- Yes. I can make portraits.

34:55.813 --> 34:58.806
Do you think so?

35:11.294 --> 35:13.888
Paint it

35:23.294 --> 35:27.526
Yes it.

36:58.415 --> 37:01.373
Hi, mad me.

40:19.415 --> 40:22.327
Shill, you are beautiful.

40:34.415 --> 40:38.090
Why can not you be that way?
when we are alone?

40:38.335 --> 40:42.453
Can not we go somewhere
and being alone?

40:43.255 --> 40:46.008
We can try.

41:03.615 --> 41:06.652
Why do you lock the door?

41:06.735 --> 41:09.772
Some may come in.

41:14.335 --> 41:17.088
What is it with you?
Are you shy or?

41:17.415 --> 41:20.851
Do not you care about yourself?

41:21.135 --> 41:23.091
Yes I do.

41:23.175 --> 41:27.805
I'm not ashamed
for something I do.

41:39.175 --> 41:42.326
You're pissed on Buddy-

41:42.415 --> 41:45.054
- and are looking to give up again.

41:45.135 --> 41:48.923
And you will use that for me.

41:49.135 --> 41:52.013
Be grateful
for small services

41:52.095 --> 41:55.451
You want me to fight for you,
right?

41:58.335 --> 42:00.929
If you're scared, the little one ...

42:01.135 --> 42:04.207
I'm not afraid of anyone.

42:05.055 --> 42:08.286
Not for me once?

42:09.175 --> 42:12.645
Or what can I do you?

42:12.855 --> 42:19.374
I just know I want you
more than any other girl.

42:22.615 --> 42:25.652
Will you fight for me?

42:25.735 --> 42:29.614
I should kill for you.

42:45.295 --> 42:47.763
Bingham is outside.

43:19.815 --> 43:24.445
- Complain again.
- Are you bothering us again?

43:25.535 --> 43:28.732
Hope it's not the beginning
a long tiring weekend.

43:28.775 --> 43:32.973
If we go out and drive a bit,
do you bother us?

43:33.055 --> 43:36.843
Do we have a quiet and fun party,
Do you come and disturb.

43:36.895 --> 43:39.568
Is that what you are going to do?
do your career?

43:39.655 --> 43:42.044
Not far from.

43:43.295 --> 43:46.287
Are you going out and running this weekend?

43:46.375 --> 43:49.492
Maybe. We have our rights.

43:49.535 --> 43:52.493
It has everyone else too.

43:52.575 --> 43:59.208
Take it easy. Otherwise I'll put
take you in a couple of days.

43:59.295 --> 44:03.846
- Are you threatening me? Do you have arrest warrant?
- I'm just saying that.

44:03.935 --> 44:06.574
That's okay, old friend.

44:10.135 --> 44:14.572
Where have you been tonight?

44:14.815 --> 44:19.843
I said so. We have been here
at a quiet and fun party.

44:20.215 --> 44:25.653
A guest was killed in the park
tonight. Someone killed him.

44:25.695 --> 44:28.448
So bad then.

44:29.255 --> 44:34.852
And the perpetrator was comfy and
a jacket like you.

44:35.295 --> 44:38.412
Do you want to arrest me?

44:39.415 --> 44:42.248
Maybe do it this time.

44:42.335 --> 44:48.808
We'll see. Best you get ready
to the big fall.

44:49.295 --> 44:52.970
There are many who have comfy
and such a jacket.

44:56.175 --> 44:59.611
We'll see. See you soon.

44:59.695 --> 45:03.609
- Certainly.
- Many times a day.

45:03.696 --> 45:08.292
So be careful to spit
on the sidewalk. All right?

45:10.056 --> 45:12.729
- I will not do it.
- No do not do it.

45:13.536 --> 45:15.811
Have it, mate.

45:19.576 --> 45:24.934
What do you say about it? Warning
from our own private purk.

45:25.016 --> 45:27.735
Shall we drive out
this weekend?

45:31.256 --> 45:35.454
Do not want to
he's going to be on the go.

45:35.536 --> 45:38.653
It's you who decide, Buddy.

45:44.896 --> 45:51.574
Look at him a. The purse took us almost
and he has not noticed anything.

45:51.656 --> 45:56.684
You should marry
and relax a little.

46:02.336 --> 46:04.406
Do you know what we do?

46:05.736 --> 46:09.570
We are going to Nevada
and make weddings.

46:24.256 --> 46:27.134
- How are you?
- Good.

46:27.216 --> 46:31.892
- Do you have a carburetor for me?
- Takes a week to get one.

46:32.016 --> 46:37.090
- I'm knocking one. Available?
- Yes, Please.

46:37.176 --> 46:41.931
The girls are waiting here.

46:47.136 --> 46:50.765
Only members.

47:01.376 --> 47:03.970
Who has my beer?

47:12.576 --> 47:14.373
Alright, the meeting is set.

47:14.496 --> 47:16.487
We have some things to talk about.

47:16.576 --> 47:22.094
Firstly, the battle yesterday
was self-defense.

47:22.416 --> 47:25.214
The guy pulled that knife, right?

47:25.296 --> 47:27.651
You really calmed him.

47:27.776 --> 47:33.408
If Bingham or anyone comes,
we do not know anything.

47:34.536 --> 47:37.608
He's the poet guy is all right,
right?

47:38.176 --> 47:40.132
Who wants him?
as a member?

47:40.216 --> 47:43.094
Okay. Who does he propose?

47:43.216 --> 47:45.525
I.

47:45.576 --> 47:49.888
- I support him.
- He is a childhood pomp.

47:49.976 --> 47:52.046
I like him.

47:52.176 --> 47:55.213
Okay, go get him.

47:56.136 --> 47:59.412
Third, just right.

48:03.456 --> 48:08.052
Gypsy and Abigale will
marry.

48:12.776 --> 48:15.006
Take him, Bull.

48:15.936 --> 48:18.734
Take him

48:19.496 --> 48:21.612
He likes it.

48:33.096 --> 48:36.850
Here he is.
The poet.

48:53.856 --> 48:57.166
You are now aspiring to become a member.

48:59.576 --> 49:02.295
Come on. Take it on you.

49:03.376 --> 49:06.209
See how well it fits.

50:32.456 --> 50:36.051
- Purks.
- I've seen them.

50:36.216 --> 50:42.325
Drink your coke.
We have nothing to hide.

51:32.536 --> 51:34.367
What's up?

51:34.456 --> 51:37.971
Looks like we get an escort.

51:38.056 --> 51:42.766
See how people are there
with open mouth-

51:43.376 --> 51:46.209
- and the island on the stalk.

52:24.816 --> 52:27.330
Just like the president.

53:55.777 --> 53:58.530
The bride must have flowers. Pick
some bouquets.

53:58.617 --> 54:01.848
- Is this a good idea?
- Cold feet?

54:01.897 --> 54:04.855
Just a little tired and hurried.

54:05.257 --> 54:08.966
Poet, he pulls.

54:09.057 --> 54:11.696
Not after we have traveled the whole
this way.

54:13.457 --> 54:16.210
What's going on here?

54:21.017 --> 54:24.896
- What is all this noise?
- Are you going to wake all the neighbors?

54:24.977 --> 54:30.927
Not that tone to me. And you there,
stay away from the flowers!

54:31.017 --> 54:35.613
But, dear priest, they are for the bride.
All stores are closed.

54:35.857 --> 54:38.291
Is there anyone who wants to get married?

54:38.377 --> 54:42.336
Sure. These two
nice young people.

54:44.297 --> 54:48.006
And we will pay for the flowers.

54:54.897 --> 54:58.253
Just the couple and two witnesses.

55:00.257 --> 55:03.693
Wait here. Pearl will join that
maid of honor.

55:05.457 --> 55:08.210
She does not need to write
under something?

55:14.897 --> 55:21.973
I love you with all my heart

55:22.497 --> 55:25.136
from the bottom of my heart

55:25.457 --> 55:27.687
I love you

55:28.417 --> 55:32.490
Here you can sign
like the other witness.

55:32.617 --> 55:35.051
Please, this way.

55:39.817 --> 55:43.696
We are a motorcycle club.

55:43.777 --> 55:45.893
I can hear that.

55:45.977 --> 55:50.607
We've heard that parachutists
gets married in the air.

55:50.817 --> 55:54.526
And divers
marry under water.

55:55.177 --> 55:58.886
Have heard it. It is spotting
a holy ceremony.

55:58.977 --> 56:04.495
That's your opinion.
But we also have our faith.

56:04.817 --> 56:06.887
We mix in what you do.

56:06.977 --> 56:10.811
I do not put myself on one
motorcycle and reading the Bible.

56:11.897 --> 56:17.415
We do not expect that.
We can bring the bikes here.

56:17.937 --> 56:20.576
I was born faster than this.

56:21.297 --> 56:29.056
Everyone out there is his friends
and they will look at when he gets married.

56:29.897 --> 56:32.775
Are you sure
that you will do this?

56:36.377 --> 56:38.288
Definitely.

56:40.817 --> 56:43.251
Outside.

56:51.697 --> 56:54.336
How long did it take?
with your wife?

56:54.417 --> 56:56.373
Is it OK?

56:56.457 --> 56:59.654
Should I take away from you?
this blessed moment?

57:01.377 --> 57:06.053
Stand still in line
as an honorary guardian.

58:29.897 --> 58:32.331
Let's sing.

58:32.977 --> 58:38.734
Here comes the bride
completely dressed in white

58:59.297 --> 59:02.607
Why do they make fun of it?

59:03.377 --> 59:04.810
Who knows?

59:04.897 --> 59:08.856
Do you, Abigale McKenna, this one
the husband of your husband?

59:08.937 --> 59:09.813
Yes.

59:09.857 --> 59:12.894
Do you, Darryl Rickman-

59:13.017 --> 59:15.929
- this woman to yours
wife?

59:16.217 --> 59:19.095
- Yes.
- Rings.

59:19.937 --> 59:21.575
Do you have a ring?

59:21.697 --> 59:25.451
Lunatic. How are you getting married?
without a ring?

59:26.817 --> 59:29.172
It's a flip.

59:30.257 --> 59:33.169
So funny that one can cry.

59:34.017 --> 59:39.649
As my authority
I declare you husband and wife.

59:39.897 --> 59:42.331
You can kiss the bride.

59:52.657 --> 59:56.570
Now it's my turn.

01:00:41.377 --> 01:00:44.608
Rent a room for them. Have you
groats?

01:00:50.897 --> 01:00:55.254
Look, Jesse James
and his ties.

01:00:55.337 --> 01:00:57.567
Is this Jesse?

01:00:57.657 --> 01:01:01.616
He is the leader. He's fine
the best horses.

01:01:01.737 --> 01:01:04.205
You are going to lose.

01:01:04.297 --> 01:01:08.449
I'm not alone. I have
many friends in the bar.

01:01:08.497 --> 01:01:12.126
We just came to have a beer.

01:01:12.257 --> 01:01:15.932
- Another place.
- You do not understand.

01:01:15.977 --> 01:01:19.492
We do not want anywhere else.
We want to drink beer here.

01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:23.735
Sorry, but it's full here.

01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:28.972
- Not even a small one?
- Not a drop.

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:33.608
Take your smelly bastard bags and
bikes and sticks.

01:01:34.057 --> 01:01:37.208
You are going to
get hurt. Did you know?

01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:41.212
Let's make up then.

01:01:42.577 --> 01:01:45.171
You do not understand.

01:01:45.257 --> 01:01:50.377
Should I fight with anyone who would
I had to fight all the time.

01:01:50.617 --> 01:01:56.931
If you want to fight with me,
do you have to fight with all of us.

01:01:57.057 --> 01:02:00.288
Nice little comfy, what?

01:02:28.658 --> 01:02:30.091
Has Gypsy got her room?

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:34.736
Could not have left
Who's left outside?

01:02:35.458 --> 01:02:39.053
Then it's just stolen.

01:02:49.258 --> 01:02:53.012
If I left you outside
you are also stolen.

01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:58.568
They fight.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:06.090
Come on, please.

01:03:06.218 --> 01:03:09.335
I come. But it looks
as they may need some help.

01:03:15.698 --> 01:03:18.610
They are doing fine.

01:03:25.938 --> 01:03:29.408
Do not you come to bed?

01:05:52.698 --> 01:05:57.294
Hi Buddy, where are you going?

01:05:57.698 --> 01:06:02.249
Squaw Rock. With Moely and the guys.

01:06:02.338 --> 01:06:05.489
Enjoy yourself.

01:08:42.298 --> 01:08:44.970
How do you feel?

01:08:45.457 --> 01:08:48.450
Why do you ask
always?

01:08:49.298 --> 01:08:52.210
Maybe I'll start
to like you

01:08:52.298 --> 01:08:54.607
Beginner.

01:08:54.738 --> 01:08:58.697
Do not leave what happened last night
get to your head

01:08:58.858 --> 01:09:02.453
Did not mean anything to you?

01:09:03.258 --> 01:09:06.807
That was what it was.
Nothing else.

01:09:08.698 --> 01:09:12.008
You are me a nice rebel.

01:09:12.098 --> 01:09:17.694
Totally broken because Shill does not swear
on a cloud for it last night.

01:09:20.497 --> 01:09:23.774
- nothing to blow up
Love them and walk from them.

01:09:23.858 --> 01:09:26.212
Is that why you joined the Angels?

01:09:26.298 --> 01:09:29.973
So you can get down on
citizens and be free?

01:09:31.457 --> 01:09:34.654
Why are you here
if you do not like it?

01:09:34.738 --> 01:09:41.176
- Maybe I'm spying for the fool.
- Maybe you like rough treatment?

01:09:42.417 --> 01:09:44.408
You learn.

01:09:44.497 --> 01:09:46.488
Listen.

01:09:47.377 --> 01:09:52.577
Could I just make you cut
pisseprekenet and relax a little.

01:09:52.938 --> 01:09:55.293
Wish you did it.

01:09:56.818 --> 01:09:59.207
Wish
somebody could.

01:10:00.338 --> 01:10:03.933
Everyone is terrified
to take responsibility.

01:10:06.418 --> 01:10:10.536
I can take responsibility for you.

01:10:12.378 --> 01:10:17.406
Have a beer. I like you
not when you get angry with me

01:12:08.459 --> 01:12:10.575
You are different.

01:12:10.619 --> 01:12:17.092
I have said so. So all out
Like me, I had not been anything.

01:12:17.459 --> 01:12:23.489
When people see me on the street, I want to
that they should say:He is the leader.

01:12:25.819 --> 01:12:28.936
Will you never grow up?

01:12:29.019 --> 01:12:31.579
You do not need money
in order to live off?

01:12:31.659 --> 01:12:34.457
I have enough.

01:12:34.779 --> 01:12:38.818
A little money can be done all the time
obtain.

01:12:38.899 --> 01:12:41.777
Do you just want a little?

01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:46.216
How much do I need? I pay
$ 50 a month in rent.

01:12:46.299 --> 01:12:50.133
I do not drink champagne and
do not go to fine restaurants.

01:12:50.219 --> 01:12:53.928
But if you want to marry one day?

01:13:00.779 --> 01:13:03.612
Have already tried it.

01:13:03.699 --> 01:13:08.056
And it's just crazy. Two people
that cling to a paper.

01:13:10.259 --> 01:13:12.454
What's the joke about it?

01:13:12.539 --> 01:13:15.611
I want you now.

01:13:16.139 --> 01:13:19.211
Do you want anything with me?

01:13:26.299 --> 01:13:31.851
And tomorrow you'll hit
other guy-

01:13:32.259 --> 01:13:36.491
- and want to be with him.
And that's okay.

01:13:36.899 --> 01:13:40.016
And I find something new.

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:42.209
I do not know if I like it.

01:13:42.299 --> 01:13:47.692
Girls have nothing to say.
They just gotta shut up.

01:13:48.339 --> 01:13:51.490
If you do not like it,
just jumping off.

01:13:51.579 --> 01:13:54.776
You're joking?

01:13:57.859 --> 01:14:01.329
Yes of course.

01:14:13.699 --> 01:14:16.213
Want a ripe?

01:14:17.059 --> 01:14:19.209
Why not?

01:14:19.299 --> 01:14:22.848
Ally, everyone. Come on.

01:14:24.339 --> 01:14:28.332
Hi, I do not share you.

01:14:28.419 --> 01:14:31.456
As you wish.

01:14:31.939 --> 01:14:34.692
It's far to go to town.

01:14:35.019 --> 01:14:37.772
Come on. Jump on

01:14:39.859 --> 01:14:42.134
Get up with you.

01:14:42.219 --> 01:14:47.691
- Do not imagine anything.
- Just fine.

01:14:49.499 --> 01:14:54.050
Otherwise, we get out of the way over the road.

01:14:54.779 --> 01:15:01.651
- Do you never bathe?
- A month ago. My charm.

01:15:07.619 --> 01:15:11.328
- You're sitting with me.
- Okay, Buddy.

01:15:12.099 --> 01:15:14.454
Hi, wait a minute.

01:15:15.259 --> 01:15:18.410
Shill is not a potato bag.

01:15:19.219 --> 01:15:22.495
And you're not an Angel yet,
småen.

01:15:22.939 --> 01:15:27.694
We keep learning about you.
So just relax.

01:15:31.219 --> 01:15:34.370
Find out by yourself.

01:15:38.699 --> 01:15:42.169
I'm still a little sleepy.
What do you have?

01:15:45.819 --> 01:15:48.538
Guaranteed full speed.

01:15:59.379 --> 01:16:02.928
You are a rat. A beautiful rat.

01:16:03.019 --> 01:16:05.579
The only rat boy, baby.

01:19:21.259 --> 01:19:24.296
That's the girl for Bull.

01:19:28.899 --> 01:19:31.652
You delicious sheep.

01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:34.011
- Drive to the side!
- Come on, gammer.

01:20:42.220 --> 01:20:45.610
Idiot, away road.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.571
Come on, get away!

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:54.459
Swing away.

01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:18.573
Now you are not sitting properly.

01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.535
Cut out, your baby.

01:21:22.620 --> 01:21:26.056
Relax, you're sitting on
with the best.

01:21:26.180 --> 01:21:31.015
I can make it sit down
and give a lab.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.857
He drove off the road. I saw the dust.

01:21:47.940 --> 01:21:53.492
Just got a hole outside.
It certainly went well.

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:15.253
- Hey, shit.
- Sergeant Bingham.

01:22:16.700 --> 01:22:23.014
A welcome committee. Watch
blank sign.

01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:28.734
Do you have refreshments?

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:32.495
- I told you we'll see you again.
- Yes, you did.

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:35.857
You've been having fun?

01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.932
In Nevada? It's beyond
your district.

01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:43.053
- This time it was flausing.
- Flause this time.

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.649
Not in hell either.

01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:49.978
Hello shill

01:22:50.100 --> 01:22:52.534
Who are you with today?

01:22:52.620 --> 01:22:56.499
Is not that personal?

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:59.458
Who are you wearing?

01:22:59.580 --> 01:23:02.458
I'm sitting on with Buddy.

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:05.379
I'll hold you, Buddy.

01:23:05.420 --> 01:23:07.331
You're joking.

01:23:07.420 --> 01:23:10.537
You were involved in an accident.

01:23:10.580 --> 01:23:16.450
Impossible. Look at my bike.
Not a scratch on it.

01:23:16.500 --> 01:23:22.257
You last ran with a girl behind
on the bike. I have two witnesses.

01:23:25.500 --> 01:23:32.850
They were wrong. I ran last and last
He front as usual.

01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:39.328
He is out of control. I drove last
with that pretty little girl at the back.

01:23:39.380 --> 01:23:43.373
- No, that's the way ...
Wait a minute, I was.

01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.936
Why did you do it?

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:52.212
Wanted to. Would not blame him
something for the guests.

01:23:53.420 --> 01:23:57.857
- We did not want to lie to you.
- Take them all together.

01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:07.212
What is this? A guy will be
scared of us and driving off the road.

01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.410
Should we pay compensation, or?

01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:15.013
He was killed.

01:24:18.220 --> 01:24:20.734
Come on.

01:24:20.860 --> 01:24:22.771
Wait.

01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:27.337
They can not arrest me.
I have not done anything.

01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:30.856
I do not even know them.

01:24:31.740 --> 01:24:36.256
It was him. He drove last.

01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:48.730
Well, Jocko. You stay with us.

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:54.696
You will not see your friends
other than in prison.

01:24:54.780 --> 01:24:58.409
You will have one to five years
for this.

01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:02.252
Too bad it was not you.

01:25:02.420 --> 01:25:05.969
- But I'll take you for guests.
- Just try.

01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:11.331
Do you want to tell me about guests?

01:25:12.580 --> 01:25:16.209
Perhaps you get reduced punishment

01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:30.170
Cut out now!

01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:32.893
We'll see.

01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:34.897
No hassle now.

01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:39.456
Get off.

01:26:02.820 --> 01:26:06.893
Do you believe Bingham
Are you looking for Pearl?

01:26:08.620 --> 01:26:11.009
Are you involved in this?
We'll take back Jocko.

01:26:11.100 --> 01:26:14.979
- Are you crazy?
- Should we kidnap him?

01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:19.139
- It's too dangerous.
- I do not ask.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.379
We wait until they are down in the valley.
Then we take them in the intersection.

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:27.020
They continue
and Jocko is driving with us.

01:26:27.100 --> 01:26:33.448
We explain to them that Jocko
not so often in prison.

01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.613
And if it does not help,
we'll find something.

01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:39.736
They are armed.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:43.654
- There are many more of us.
- Are you trying to kill me?

01:26:43.740 --> 01:26:47.050
You are too naughty to die.

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:26.253
Squaw Rock is canceled.
Drive towards the ruins.

01:27:29.460 --> 01:27:32.657
Tonight there will be a party!

01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.894
Hi, Moley.
- How are you?

01:28:11.701 --> 01:28:15.091
Look here. The newlyweds.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:30.772
- Did you enjoy it?
- Drink two beers and fall asleep.

01:28:32.181 --> 01:28:34.570
Now you are joking.

01:29:20.221 --> 01:29:22.894
I'm sticking now.

01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:29.136
Down the beach to La Paz
and forget the scorpion.

01:29:30.901 --> 01:29:33.654
That's fine.

01:29:53.381 --> 01:29:56.976
I would be alone.

01:29:58.261 --> 01:30:00.331
Without Buddy too?

01:30:00.421 --> 01:30:03.060
Without all.

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:10.053
You said I'd figure it out
self.

01:30:10.421 --> 01:30:12.412
Find out what?

01:30:12.461 --> 01:30:16.340
Why you stuck so fast
Buddy waved his finger.

01:30:18.501 --> 01:30:20.651
You took it hard, what?

01:30:26.901 --> 01:30:30.337
Stop staring at me.
You look like an idiot.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.936
Want to tell me
what is the problem?

01:30:41.701 --> 01:30:43.931
The problem!

01:30:44.301 --> 01:30:49.421
The bourgeois way to say that!
A girl has a problem?

01:30:50.821 --> 01:30:56.453
They can not help me.
I'm taking a mess on them all.

01:30:56.581 --> 01:31:00.620
I'm one big cliché.

01:31:01.581 --> 01:31:04.015
I want kids.

01:31:10.621 --> 01:31:13.010
With Buddy?

01:31:14.021 --> 01:31:16.615
Correct.

01:31:16.821 --> 01:31:19.415
Have you told him?

01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:23.540
Why should I do that? So he can
marry me?

01:31:23.621 --> 01:31:26.340
Do you want to marry him?

01:31:28.461 --> 01:31:30.372
I do not know...

01:31:30.461 --> 01:31:35.376
- Do you think he wants?
- Why should he?

01:31:35.461 --> 01:31:39.613
- I want that.
- It's not yours.

01:31:40.621 --> 01:31:43.454
Does not matter.

01:31:43.781 --> 01:31:46.773
Do you want to marry me anyway?

01:31:48.661 --> 01:31:51.698
Yes.

01:32:04.581 --> 01:32:08.699
She is my property!
Do not you ever learn?

01:32:08.821 --> 01:32:11.540
Do not you?

01:32:11.981 --> 01:32:14.654
She will have children with you.

01:32:14.741 --> 01:32:18.256
Tough. Do you plan to be midwife?

01:32:18.341 --> 01:32:21.538
Is nothing important to you?

01:32:21.781 --> 01:32:27.413
- You're just a damned bluff.
- Shut up. Just do as I say.

01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:30.533
I'm not in your tires.

01:32:30.621 --> 01:32:34.978
- Then you can just stab.
- I do not need you.

01:33:37.101 --> 01:33:41.060
Come on!
