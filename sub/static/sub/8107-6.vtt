Or Cushing's or calcium deficiency.

that before a race.

an MRI to be sure,

caused by just dehydration in the heat.

to stay conscious kind of important.

to be extra careful.

on your race car driver's CT

07:32.703 --> 07:34.539
and the history
and physical were normal.

07:34.664 --> 07:36.833
Her deep tendon reflexes
seemed a bit weak to me.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.127
Areflexia could
mean Miller Fisher.

07:39.252 --> 07:41.462
Yes, areflexia
could mean Miller Fisher,

07:41.587 --> 07:45.258
but since the reflex was weak, not
absent, it doesn't mean anything.

to be uncooperative.

she overplayed it.

- I can't.
- You've got my permission.

- Doesn't matter anymore.

and the brain, classic autoimmune.

12:26.205 --> 12:30.209
Flirt all you want, but I should warn
you, <i>shiksas</i> are for practice.

12:30.334 --> 12:33.003
Lupus this aggressive
wouldn't spare her kidneys.

12:33.129 --> 12:35.172
It's primarily neurological.
Let's start her on...

12:35.297 --> 12:36.966
Then why no plaques
on her MRI?

12:37.091 --> 12:39.135
MRI was inconclusive.
Start her on...

12:39.260 --> 12:40.719
So, now you're sure
that it's MS.

12:41.220 --> 12:43.055
Just like you were sure
it was Miller Fisher.

12:43.264 --> 12:45.307
An hour after you were sure
it was heatstroke.

12:45.433 --> 12:48.144
The symptoms fit.
Start her on interferon.

12:48.269 --> 12:49.603
We're not gonna
score any points with House

12:49.728 --> 12:51.522
if we solve this
just by running your errands.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.524
- I get that you wanna be right.
- You don't?

12:53.649 --> 12:56.235
I'm just trying to save the patient,
not score points with my boss.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.864
Would it hurt the patient
if you let us run some tests?

13:03.159 --> 13:04.785
You've got three hours.

13:11.667 --> 13:13.586
We've run six complete
tox screens,

13:13.711 --> 13:16.839
tested for every heavy metal, poison and
biological agent we can think of.

13:16.964 --> 13:18.716
It says here he ate
a lot of chestnuts.

13:18.841 --> 13:21.594
Hold on a second.

13:21.719 --> 13:24.180
If the squirrel liberation army
is involved, I'm out of here.

13:24.305 --> 13:25.514
Those little rodents are...

13:25.639 --> 13:27.933
Horse chestnuts are poisonous.
If someone switched them...

13:28.058 --> 13:29.560
Horse chestnuts
may look like chestnuts,

13:29.685 --> 13:32.188
but they taste like
a horse's lower than chestnuts,

13:32.313 --> 13:34.523
which makes the theory that he
accidentally ate a couple of hundred

13:34.648 --> 13:36.692
slightly less persuasive.

13:38.444 --> 13:42.490
Seeing as how he was prowling
the back alleys of Tehran...

13:42.615 --> 13:44.617
It wasn't Tehran,
it was...

13:45.618 --> 13:46.452
(EXCLAIMS)

13:46.577 --> 13:48.245
You almost got me.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.664
Unless we know the local
environmental factors,

13:50.789 --> 13:51.707
the poisonous flora...

13:51.832 --> 13:53.083
You know I can't
tell you that.

13:53.209 --> 13:56.837
Well, then why are we here? You might
as well just Google "poison."

13:56.962 --> 14:01.133
All they would tell me is he spent
the last eleven months in Bolivia.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.386
Who you gonna kill
in Bolivia? My old housekeeper?

14:04.595 --> 14:05.638
We don't kill people.

14:05.763 --> 14:08.015
I'm sorry, who are you
gonna marginalize?

14:08.140 --> 14:10.601
If it is my housekeeper,
she has it coming.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.269
Cleaning the windows
means cleaning both sides.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.230
Am I right or am I right?

14:14.355 --> 14:16.273
What does it matter
what he was doing?

14:16.398 --> 14:18.275
- The guy's dying.
- Not anymore.

14:18.400 --> 14:20.611
I know what's
poisoning him, and who.

14:20.736 --> 14:22.029
John.

14:24.323 --> 14:25.616
It's just pancreatitis.

14:25.741 --> 14:27.117
He's not an alcoholic.

14:27.243 --> 14:29.411
And unless his pancreas
is in his fingers...

14:29.537 --> 14:31.205
Spies can't get
fungal infections?

14:31.330 --> 14:32.331
And the burns on his skin?

14:32.456 --> 14:34.416
Spies can't get sunburns?

14:34.542 --> 14:35.501
Bolivia doesn't have sun?

14:35.626 --> 14:40.130
So, either we go with his theory
of the non-drinking drunk,

14:40.256 --> 14:42.132
or he was poisoned
by some group

14:42.258 --> 14:45.052
with the resources
to make it completely untraceable,

14:45.177 --> 14:47.346
some customized isotope.

14:51.392 --> 14:54.228
Let's treat for
radiation poisoning.

14:55.896 --> 15:02.111
The iodine's to protect your thyroid.
Antibiotics are to handle infections.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.280
Should start working
in a couple of hours.

15:04.405 --> 15:07.616
We should celebrate
with a beer or eight.

15:08.701 --> 15:10.286
I don't drink.

15:10.411 --> 15:13.497
Oh, me thinks he doth
protest too much.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.749
He's deathly ill.
Why would he lie about drinking?

15:15.874 --> 15:20.045
Guilt over killing a man would make
anyone hit the sauce.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.172
We don't kill people.

15:22.590 --> 15:23.424
HOUSE: Right.

15:23.549 --> 15:25.426
You just lie
to your friends and family,

15:25.551 --> 15:28.971
establish false identities, trick people
into betraying their country.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.516
He'd never
cover up his drinking. He's too honest.

15:32.641 --> 15:35.519
Hey! Something
I've always wanted to know.

15:35.644 --> 15:38.397
That poison lipstick
that Ginger used to kiss Gilligan,

15:38.522 --> 15:40.441
why didn't that kill her?

15:46.238 --> 15:47.448
Okay, drum roll!

15:47.573 --> 15:51.410
LP is negative
for meningitis.

15:51.535 --> 15:53.579
Sorry, Cole.

15:53.704 --> 15:57.625
Fat pad biopsy is...
Wait for it...

15:58.584 --> 16:03.297
Negative for amyloidosis
and Thirteen goes down!

16:03.422 --> 16:04.590
Could we hurry this up?
My son has...

16:04.715 --> 16:06.258
Can I have a kid, too?
I'm working too hard.

16:06.383 --> 16:07.301
I could hook you up.

16:07.468 --> 16:08.886
If I had two minutes
and some anti-nausea meds,

16:09.011 --> 16:11.013
I'd take you up
on that.

16:11.138 --> 16:12.890
And for the gold...

16:14.975 --> 16:17.686
Protein's 65,
glucose, 70.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.730
It's MS,
start her on interferon.

16:19.897 --> 16:20.731
Now, turn to the last page.

16:20.856 --> 16:23.108
Sad rate's 95,
ANA's weakly positive.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.234
Positive, it's lupus.

16:24.360 --> 16:26.111
Weakly, not lupus.
It's MS.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.197
We obviously don't know what it is.
Treat for both.

16:28.322 --> 16:29.990
No. I gave in
on the tests.

16:30.115 --> 16:32.368
We're not treating her
for two completely separate diseases

16:32.534 --> 16:35.621
because you think
lupus will win you a prize.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.253
- Still think it's lupus?
- Yeah.

16:43.504 --> 16:44.713
Me, too.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.133
In case of emergency,
go to the emergency room.

16:50.219 --> 16:51.053
Could be lupus.

16:51.178 --> 16:52.221
That's what we figured.

16:52.763 --> 16:53.889
Then why are you here?

16:54.014 --> 16:56.100
You're an immunologist.
We wanted to confirm...

16:56.225 --> 16:58.769
Who are you looking for me to help you
sell down the river? House or Cuddy?

16:58.977 --> 17:00.521
Foreman.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.232
- Sorry.
- He's pushing MS.

17:03.357 --> 17:04.274
Thinks that because
he's in charge,

17:04.400 --> 17:06.318
he has to prove
he's the smartest guy in the room.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.946
All I've heard about you, you put
the patient above everything else.

17:09.071 --> 17:12.074
That's why everyone
finds you so annoying.

17:13.701 --> 17:16.245
- All House cares about is results.
- I know.

17:16.370 --> 17:18.330
I'm talking about
how to deal with Foreman.

17:18.455 --> 17:19.581
So am I.

17:22.918 --> 17:24.670
Fever's down to 101.5.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.255
Treatment's working.
Why are we out here?

17:26.422 --> 17:27.798
Trying to figure out
which treatment's working.

17:27.923 --> 17:29.675
It's kind of tacky doing it
in front of the patient.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.635
You put her
on steroids, too?

17:31.760 --> 17:32.594
We had no choice.

17:32.720 --> 17:33.554
The sad rate
pointed to lupus.

17:33.679 --> 17:34.847
And the ANA ruled it out!

17:34.972 --> 17:36.306
Doctors!

17:38.642 --> 17:39.935
Legs hurt?

17:40.060 --> 17:43.647
I can't feel them at all. I don't think
I can move them.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.290
Vitals stabilizing.

18:01.457 --> 18:02.583
Tummy ache's gone as well.

18:02.708 --> 18:05.002
So, the treatment's working.

18:06.378 --> 18:10.299
You wanna ditch Dr. Killjoy
and hop on the company jet?

18:10.424 --> 18:12.801
Little trip down Mexico way,

18:12.926 --> 18:16.722
and I'm not talking about
the country or the plane.

18:16.847 --> 18:20.476
Do you think acting like an idiot and
talking about sex works on girls?

18:20.601 --> 18:23.061
Well, if it didn't, the human race
would have died out long ago.

18:23.187 --> 18:24.396
You're pretty cheery
for someone

18:24.521 --> 18:26.648
who was just proved wrong
about his pancreatitis theory.

18:26.774 --> 18:29.151
I'm appropriately cheery
for someone who's been proved right.

18:29.359 --> 18:31.528
John hasn't vomited
in six hours.

18:31.653 --> 18:34.406
What's to vomit?
I'm eating his lunch.

18:34.531 --> 18:37.117
Withholding nutrients
is the treatment for pancreatitis.

18:37.242 --> 18:39.953
That, and the antibiotics
you put him on.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.997
I did unhook
your iodine, though.

18:42.122 --> 18:45.250
Didn't seem to fit with the whole "I'm
just jerking you guys around" Gestalt.

18:45.375 --> 18:46.376
You're unbelievable.

18:46.502 --> 18:50.130
Let's ask John if he'd rather be sick
honestly or cured dishonestly.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.217
John? John?

19:02.476 --> 19:05.604
Any chance he's just
overwhelmed with gratitude?

19:18.659 --> 19:20.160
Paralysis.

19:22.246 --> 19:24.540
It's a new symptom?

19:25.374 --> 19:27.251
Big white space on the board
where it would fit.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.710
Nice, multicolored markers.

19:28.836 --> 19:32.130
I'm not writing it because we can't know
if it's a real symptom.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.383
When these two went rogue and pumped
her full of steroids, we lost...

19:34.508 --> 19:36.301
Steroids don't
cause paralysis.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.303
FOREMAN: She was also
on interferon.

19:38.428 --> 19:40.848
Giving her both probably
fried her immune system.

19:40.973 --> 19:42.432
Who knows what infection
you could cause...

19:42.558 --> 19:44.518
We consulted
an immunologist, she said we have...

19:44.643 --> 19:46.687
She? You talking
about Dr. Cameron?

19:46.812 --> 19:48.897
- She thought lupus was...
- She tell you to start treating?

19:49.022 --> 19:51.191
Yes! They've ignored you,
they screwed up

19:51.316 --> 19:53.193
and it's fun
watching you spank them.

19:53.318 --> 19:54.486
But, can we get back
to the medicine?

19:54.611 --> 19:58.574
The last thing any of you
give a damn about is the medicine.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.286
Look.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.372
I'm not saying
you're bad doctors or bad people.

20:05.497 --> 20:07.291
But House is.

20:07.416 --> 20:09.918
He created a nasty
little cutthroat world,

20:10.043 --> 20:12.254
planted you in it,
and is watching you play.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.424
And none of it works
for anyone except him.

20:17.551 --> 20:19.261
And whoever wins.

20:21.388 --> 20:24.600
Given its quick progression,
we gotta assume botulism.

20:24.725 --> 20:26.935
I'll go to her place.
Check out her fridge and pantry.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.438
It's not botulism.
It's polio.

20:34.276 --> 20:37.905
Brilliant. We should search her home
for FDR's remains or a time machine.

20:38.030 --> 20:40.616
She could have contracted it from anyone
who's been to Africa, or...

20:40.741 --> 20:41.867
She's been vaccinated.

20:41.992 --> 20:42.993
Vaccines wear off.

20:43.118 --> 20:46.246
There hasn't been
a single American case in over 20 years.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.749
I've seen this disease.
I know what it looks like.

20:48.874 --> 20:51.543
That's why you're finding it,
because you're looking for it.

20:51.668 --> 20:52.753
Polio?

20:52.878 --> 20:54.671
- It's crazy.
- House wouldn't think so.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.090
So, go find House
and tell him your theory.

20:57.215 --> 21:00.886
Take a personal day.
Seriously. Get out of here.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.764
You don't have
the power to fire me.

21:04.014 --> 21:07.476
But I do have the power
to kick your ass off my case.

21:10.187 --> 21:11.605
I'm starting
the botulism treatment.

21:11.730 --> 21:14.942
The rest of you,
look for confirmation.

21:22.491 --> 21:23.700
He should be
brought up on charges.

21:23.825 --> 21:25.577
Okay, relax.

21:25.702 --> 21:27.537
I'll take your book
out from under my piano.

21:27.663 --> 21:30.415
He's dying of radiation sickness.
He's obviously in pain.

21:30.666 --> 21:32.709
All of which could have been avoided
if you hadn't interfered...

21:32.834 --> 21:33.919
(GROANS)

21:34.044 --> 21:35.712
What was that for?

21:35.837 --> 21:39.299
Radiation sickness
kills specific cells at specific times.

21:39.424 --> 21:42.094
His hair should be coming out in clumps
before he's writhing in pain.

21:42.219 --> 21:45.555
Since it's not, I know who's
trying to kill him.

21:46.348 --> 21:47.557
God.

21:47.683 --> 21:49.518
It's blood cancer,
Waldenstrom's.

21:49.643 --> 21:52.813
Radiation can cause infections,
which set off neuropathy...

21:52.938 --> 21:55.232
If you had
any real evidence of foul play,

21:55.357 --> 21:57.359
you'd be
torturing Bolivians

21:57.484 --> 22:00.988
instead of putting me into a state
of anticipatory sexual arousal.

22:01.113 --> 22:02.364
Can we treat for both?

22:02.489 --> 22:06.034
Bad idea. Unless you're
the one who's trying to poison him.

22:06.159 --> 22:09.037
I'll arrange for
plasmapheresis and chemo.

22:09.454 --> 22:10.956
Are you gonna trust him
after what he did?

22:11.123 --> 22:14.209
I don't have to trust him
to agree with him.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.590
You make a good point.

22:20.716 --> 22:23.510
I've been wrong every time and she still
won't listen to you.

22:23.635 --> 22:28.140
So, either she really likes me
or she really hates you.

22:28.265 --> 22:30.600
And I got a ride
in the jet.

22:35.897 --> 22:38.233
Oh, hi.
What are you doing here?

22:38.358 --> 22:39.526
Just came to say hi.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.736
Hi again.

22:40.861 --> 22:42.821
Where's Mrs. Bearman?

22:42.946 --> 22:44.031
Sent her home.

22:44.156 --> 22:45.824
I was scheduling her
for an MRA.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.576
If we gave MRAs
to every patient with a headache...

22:47.701 --> 22:50.245
This wasn't just a headache,
it was the worst in her life.

22:50.370 --> 22:51.747
And lucky for you,
I'm a neurologist.

22:51.872 --> 22:54.666
She went to a wine and cheese tasting.
Both triggers for migraines.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.168
She's never had
a migraine before.

22:56.293 --> 22:57.544
And I never had
a blueberry bagel,

22:57.669 --> 22:58.962
but for the first time
I had one.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.338
Bagels don't kill people.

23:00.464 --> 23:02.257
This is a classic ticking
bomb aneurism.

23:02.632 --> 23:05.427
Wow.
This taught me a lesson.

23:05.552 --> 23:07.846
I guess when I mess
with other people's patients,

23:07.971 --> 23:10.682
I risk looking like
an officious bitch.

23:14.061 --> 23:16.980
We're gonna have to
track down Mrs. Bearman.

23:19.733 --> 23:22.778
Wait. Never mind.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.447
It's funny.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.365
It's not funny,
it's totally immature.

23:27.491 --> 23:28.617
It is funny.

23:28.742 --> 23:30.619
You just can't appreciate it,
because you're the victim.

23:30.744 --> 23:33.497
Yeah. I deserve shame
and ridicule for offering a consult.

23:33.622 --> 23:35.082
Unheard of for a doctor.

23:35.207 --> 23:37.084
You didn't offer
a medical consult.

23:37.209 --> 23:39.461
You offered a
dealing-with-Foreman consult.

23:39.669 --> 23:42.756
For the good of the patient.
It's what House would have done.

23:42.881 --> 23:46.009
Maybe House will hear about it
and tear up with pride.

23:46.134 --> 23:47.594
You think I'm trying
to impress him.

23:47.719 --> 23:50.180
I think that for someone
who's not involved in his team,

23:50.472 --> 23:53.100
you're remarkably
involved in his team.

23:53.225 --> 23:55.102
Let it go.

23:55.227 --> 23:56.561
Let him go.

24:00.941 --> 24:02.692
And that's mature.

24:10.075 --> 24:12.536
One-twenty over 80.
Let 'er rip.

24:16.498 --> 24:19.126
Now we got the medical stuff
out of the way,

24:19.251 --> 24:20.710
why don't we meet
back at your place

24:20.836 --> 24:23.421
for some enhanced
interrogation techniques?

24:23.547 --> 24:26.633
My safe word is, "Help,
please, please, stop."

24:26.758 --> 24:29.136
It's two pleases. Anything
less than that, you keep going.

24:29.302 --> 24:33.223
You actually cure this guy,
I'll show you my private water board.

24:34.933 --> 24:38.270
We need to consult
an oncologist about the chemo.

24:40.647 --> 24:43.608
Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you
were still euphemizing.

24:44.109 --> 24:46.444
My valet knows
a little oncology.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.118
I was wondering when you'd grow bored
of avoiding my calls.

24:53.451 --> 24:56.246
Oh, I could never grow
bored of ignoring you.

24:56.371 --> 24:58.290
What's the latest protocol
on Waldenstrom's?

24:58.415 --> 24:59.416
Where are you?

24:59.541 --> 25:01.209
CIA headquarters.

25:01.334 --> 25:02.419
<i>How much fludarabine
do you need...</i>

25:02.544 --> 25:05.463
Either you're sprawled naked on your
floor with an empty bottle of Vicodin

25:05.589 --> 25:07.465
or collapsed naked
in front of your computer

25:07.591 --> 25:08.800
with an empty bottle
of Viagra.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.136
Please tell me which,
because Chase has another pool going.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.180
They flew me in to help
deal with a sick employee.

25:13.305 --> 25:14.472
<i>How much...
WILSON: Hallucinations?</i>

25:14.639 --> 25:16.600
Damn, I shouldn't have
bet on the Viagra.

25:16.766 --> 25:19.394
Okay. Call the Langley switchboard,
ask for extension...

25:19.644 --> 25:22.063
- Thirty-five, seventy-eight.
- Three, five, seven, eight.

25:22.564 --> 25:25.400
He asked an awful lot
of questions for a valet.

25:25.942 --> 25:29.654
You know, I happen to have a position
available on my penis.

25:32.657 --> 25:36.036
Wait a second, I think
I screwed up that joke.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.913
You offering me a job?

25:38.038 --> 25:39.664
I'd settle for that.

25:39.789 --> 25:44.419
As tempting as a position
on your staff is, I like it here.

25:44.544 --> 25:46.922
Pays better, and we've only had
one assassination attempt.

25:47.047 --> 25:48.423
And I'm sure
you're a great boss.

25:48.548 --> 25:52.427
That's why your fellows
left en masse a couple of months ago.

25:52.552 --> 25:54.679
I have satellite images.

25:55.931 --> 25:58.266
(PHONE RINGING)

26:03.104 --> 26:04.147
Inspector Gadget?

26:05.565 --> 26:07.776
My God, you're
actually at the CIA.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.027
You've gotta get down here.

26:09.152 --> 26:11.655
They've got a satellite
aimed directly into Cuddy's vagina.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.533
I told them the chances
of invasion are slim to none, but...

26:15.659 --> 26:17.244
Waldenstrom's.

26:17.369 --> 26:20.956
Recommended dose is 25 milligrams
per meter squared.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.457
They do
a background check on you?

26:22.582 --> 26:23.792
Twenty-five milligrams.

26:23.917 --> 26:25.126
They did a background
check on you,

26:25.252 --> 26:26.628
they did a background check
on your friends.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.588
Relax. I'm sure they already know

26:28.713 --> 26:30.548
that you brought heroin back from
Afghanistan.

26:30.674 --> 26:32.008
<i>WILSON: That's not true.</i>

26:32.133 --> 26:34.636
I've never been
to Afghanistan.

26:35.345 --> 26:36.638
House?

26:39.933 --> 26:41.059
LOU: She's getting worse.

26:41.184 --> 26:43.228
Her fever's risen slightly.

26:46.773 --> 26:50.235
But it's definitely...
What? Botulism?

26:51.069 --> 26:52.988
Right? Because
if you're wrong again,

26:53.113 --> 26:55.615
and you're treating her for something
that she doesn't even have...

26:55.740 --> 26:58.159
The anti-toxin
hasn't had time to work yet.

26:58.285 --> 27:01.162
I know it's hard,
but try to be patient.

27:04.082 --> 27:05.583
Excuse me.

27:13.383 --> 27:14.592
I know you're pissed
I interrupted,

27:14.718 --> 27:16.303
but you're gonna be
even more pissed in a second.

27:16.678 --> 27:18.263
You tested her
without telling me?

27:18.388 --> 27:22.183
Yeah. I know, I'm really,
really sorry, but...

27:22.309 --> 27:24.769
On the other hand,
it's positive.

27:27.147 --> 27:28.898
She has polio.

27:32.068 --> 27:33.820
Now what, boss?

27:36.740 --> 27:38.408
Where's House?

27:39.159 --> 27:41.953
He's blown
off four hours of clinic.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.583
He's consulting
for the CIA.

27:48.585 --> 27:50.378
Seriously, call Langley,

27:50.503 --> 27:54.591
and ask for extension three, five...
It's three, five, three, six?

27:54.716 --> 27:56.259
It's definitely
two threes.

27:56.384 --> 27:58.470
I wrote it down.
I have it somewhere.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.806
He's gonna make up
twice his skipped hours in the clinic.

28:01.931 --> 28:03.475
Okay-duke.

28:03.600 --> 28:06.061
And for protecting him,
you're gonna make up twice that.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.021
Why are you punishing me
worse than him?

28:08.146 --> 28:11.024
Because House never learns.
You might.

28:11.358 --> 28:12.359
(DOOR CLOSES)

28:21.326 --> 28:22.744
How are you feeling?

28:23.828 --> 28:25.080
Like crap.

28:25.246 --> 28:27.540
Yeah. Cancer
can be that way.

28:29.542 --> 28:31.544
My hair is falling out.

28:34.798 --> 28:36.925
Is that the chemo?

28:37.634 --> 28:39.135
No, that's too quick.

28:41.846 --> 28:43.723
So, what does it mean?

28:47.394 --> 28:49.646
It means
you don't have cancer.

28:51.272 --> 28:53.942
Someone actually
did try to kill you.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.201
You're stubborn.
You're arrogant!

29:03.368 --> 29:04.202
There's no need to yell.

29:04.327 --> 29:05.870
You may have cost
that man his life.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.622
He's getting the
radiation treatment.

29:07.747 --> 29:09.040
Twenty-four hours
too late.

29:09.165 --> 29:11.292
I didn't yell at you
when I thought you were wrong.

29:11.668 --> 29:14.129
- I wasn't wrong.
- This isn't productive.

29:14.254 --> 29:17.048
There is no "productive,"
it's too late!

29:17.173 --> 29:20.093
Because of your inexperience,
your poor judgment

29:20.218 --> 29:23.096
and your failure to recognize
a reckless fool.

29:25.598 --> 29:27.267
Cordyceps sinensis.

29:32.147 --> 29:36.192
It's an herbal treatment
derived from a parasitic fungus.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.319
Comes from caterpillars.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.321
Along with dimercaprol
chelation,

29:40.447 --> 29:42.282
it's been shown to mitigate
bone marrow damage

29:42.407 --> 29:45.034
from radiation poisoning

29:46.327 --> 29:47.745
in monkeys.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.668
Sorry. I was stubborn
and arrogant.

29:54.085 --> 29:55.628
Self-recriminations
won't help her.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.714
Nothing's gonna help her,
she's got polio.

29:57.839 --> 29:59.340
There's no cure,
but there are treatments.

29:59.716 --> 30:00.800
No, she's dying.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.719
Yeah, every death's a tragedy.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.345
Funny how you weren't
so depressed

30:04.471 --> 30:06.639
when she was just dying because
me and Amber screwed up.

30:06.764 --> 30:09.142
And I'm also self-centered,
thanks for clarifying.

30:09.267 --> 30:11.144
Don't forget self-pitying.

30:13.188 --> 30:15.607
Vitamin C.
Extremely high doses.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.318
It was experimental treatment protocol
in the '50s...

30:18.443 --> 30:19.652
And they haven't
finished yet?

30:19.777 --> 30:21.613
They lost funding.

30:21.821 --> 30:24.365
That's because there's no logical reason
vitamin C would cure polio.

30:24.574 --> 30:26.201
Well, someone
thought there was.

30:26.326 --> 30:28.703
Someone thought black people
made excellent farm implements.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.205
I'm not talking
about hurting anyone.

30:30.330 --> 30:32.123
I just want to force-feed her
some orange juice.

30:32.248 --> 30:35.835
You wanna throw in
some bacon and eggs as well?

30:35.960 --> 30:38.171
If there's anything
you learned today,

30:38.588 --> 30:40.590
it's gotta be that
you can be wrong.

30:50.391 --> 30:52.310
John, can you hear me?

30:53.811 --> 30:57.232
We're gonna start you
on an experimental treatment.

31:00.235 --> 31:01.277
Tea?

31:02.195 --> 31:05.198
It's a Chinese herb
which has been effective.

31:05.323 --> 31:07.158
I'm dying, aren't I?

31:09.619 --> 31:11.037
Probably.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.631
We're gonna attempt
an experimental protocol.

31:21.756 --> 31:24.342
- A new drug?
- An old one. Vitamin C.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.427
Ultra-high doses
have been shown

31:26.553 --> 31:29.430
to destroy the polio virus
and heal nerve damage.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.432
She could regain use
of her legs?

31:31.558 --> 31:33.017
It's unlikely.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.187
But we're gonna try.

31:37.230 --> 31:38.856
Don't give up.

31:52.495 --> 31:53.788
(SIGHS)

31:53.913 --> 31:56.958
Nausea's not as bad.

31:58.001 --> 32:00.753
Radiation sickness
has a latency period.

32:02.046 --> 32:04.591
You'll get better
before you get worse.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.350
Wanna know what
I really did down there?

32:16.102 --> 32:18.187
Only if it's interesting.

32:20.273 --> 32:22.108
The women there,

32:23.735 --> 32:25.320
during Carnival, they...

32:26.613 --> 32:28.364
They do this dance.

32:29.782 --> 32:32.035
They call it
the devil dance.

32:34.329 --> 32:35.913
Not interesting.

32:37.790 --> 32:41.336
I spent the whole
40 days with this

32:42.420 --> 32:45.757
attache to
the Minister of Defense.

32:47.759 --> 32:52.055
The most buttoned-down woman
you'd ever meet,

32:55.350 --> 32:57.935
except when
she did this dance.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.651
She agreed
to tell me stuff.

33:07.737 --> 33:08.988
(GASPS)

33:13.242 --> 33:16.412
Okay, you got
half a good story there.

33:18.373 --> 33:19.415
Karma.

33:22.293 --> 33:26.381
Best way to rid yourself
of that guilt is to confess your sins.

33:27.548 --> 33:32.470
This pain, it's right.
It's comforting.

33:34.055 --> 33:37.392
It makes me think that somehow
it all makes sense.

33:38.559 --> 33:40.687
What do you mean 40 days?

33:41.562 --> 33:43.481
When they found out

33:44.899 --> 33:47.985
what she'd told me...

33:48.653 --> 33:51.364
Carnival in Bolivia's
only eight days.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.996
You have any idea
what a chestnut looks like?

34:03.668 --> 34:05.586
You idiot!

34:05.712 --> 34:07.380
Who are you calling
an idiot?

34:08.297 --> 34:12.343
Whoever knew that John was stationed
in Brazil, not Bolivia.

34:12.760 --> 34:14.429
Brazil?

34:14.554 --> 34:16.514
Well, then, I guess
I'm talking to you, idiot.

34:16.639 --> 34:19.809
It's the same region.
It's the same parasites, same diseases.

34:19.934 --> 34:22.061
But not the same language.

34:22.186 --> 34:23.730
In Bolivia, chestnuts
are chestnuts.

34:23.855 --> 34:26.232
Brazil, on the other hand,
has castanhas-do-péra

34:26.357 --> 34:28.568
literally,
chestnuts from Péra,

34:28.693 --> 34:32.321
because it would be stupid for people
from Brazil to call them Brazil nuts.

34:32.447 --> 34:35.158
So, he ate Brazil nuts.
Big deal.

34:35.283 --> 34:37.618
No, he ate a lot of Brazil nuts,
which is a big deal,

34:37.744 --> 34:39.078
because they
contain selenium,

34:39.203 --> 34:42.790
which in high doses causes fatigue,
vomiting, skin irritation,

34:42.915 --> 34:45.793
discharge from the fingernail beds
and hair loss.

34:45.918 --> 34:47.962
Any of that
sounding familiar?

34:50.339 --> 34:51.632
Can you treat it?

34:53.468 --> 34:55.303
We already started.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.805
Treatment's chelation, the same as
for radiation sickness.

34:57.972 --> 35:00.433
The only difference is
it works a lot better on nut poisoning.

35:01.017 --> 35:03.060
So, what's the problem?

35:03.853 --> 35:05.605
You're an idiot.

35:19.911 --> 35:21.120
Why is she shivering?

35:21.287 --> 35:23.581
Low serum calcium is a side effect
of the treatment.

35:23.706 --> 35:25.500
I can give her
a calcium supplement.

35:25.625 --> 35:27.043
My arm hurts.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.379
The infusion rate has to remain high
for the treatment to work.

35:30.505 --> 35:31.672
Is it working?

35:31.798 --> 35:33.132
(GASPS)

35:33.257 --> 35:34.342
You feel that?

35:34.592 --> 35:36.928
Yeah, it hurts.

35:38.554 --> 35:41.390
It's working!
This is fantastic.

35:49.816 --> 35:52.276
There's a lot you could learn
at my fellowship.

35:52.401 --> 35:55.238
If you knew the procedures
I could teach you...

35:55.363 --> 35:56.864
Of course, we'd need
a nurse to prep.

35:56.989 --> 36:00.576
I know how to
kill a man with my thumb.

36:00.701 --> 36:03.496
Actually, I was just trying to make
another euphemism for sex.

36:03.621 --> 36:04.914
So was I.

36:05.039 --> 36:08.125
Oh, God. How can you
flirt with this idiot?

36:08.251 --> 36:11.796
He lied to us again and again.
He broke laws, ethical codes...

36:11.921 --> 36:13.256
I was right.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.425
That doesn't mean
everything.

36:16.843 --> 36:18.010
It means a lot.

36:19.971 --> 36:24.892
Dr. Curtis, Dr. House.
I appreciate your help.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.948
(DOOR OPENS)

36:39.448 --> 36:41.242
- Hey-
- Hey-

36:54.297 --> 36:57.341
When you were dying,

36:57.466 --> 36:59.343
you tried to infect me,

36:59.468 --> 37:01.596
because you knew
I'd fight for you

37:01.721 --> 37:03.097
if I thought
I was dying, too.

37:03.389 --> 37:06.350
Are you bringing this up now so I'll
forgive you for messing with my patient?

37:06.475 --> 37:09.186
I'm happy I changed jobs.

37:09.770 --> 37:13.941
But I know I'll never
have that sort of

37:15.192 --> 37:16.068
excitement.

37:16.193 --> 37:17.528
You miss people
trying to kill you?

37:17.653 --> 37:18.738
No.

37:19.780 --> 37:23.576
I miss people doing whatever it takes
to get the job done.

37:28.414 --> 37:31.959
I guess that's why
I'm having trouble giving it up.

37:33.377 --> 37:36.964
I shouldn't have helped them
mess with your patient.

37:37.882 --> 37:41.469
They had to screw with me.
I've gotten everything wrong.

37:43.012 --> 37:45.389
I don't believe it.

37:45.514 --> 37:48.184
You're not gonna
get everything right.

37:50.061 --> 37:52.980
But you're never gonna
get everything wrong.

38:07.453 --> 38:09.038
(DOOR CLOSES)

38:15.336 --> 38:16.379
Morning!

38:17.213 --> 38:19.090
Where have you been
the last two days?

38:19.215 --> 38:21.258
- Overslept.
- We saved speed racer.

38:21.384 --> 38:24.303
She had polio.
We cured it with vitamin C.

38:25.388 --> 38:29.225
Yeah. I cured depression
with tonic water once.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.227
Actually, I think
there was some gin in it, too.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.729
A hundred and fifty grams
over six hours.

38:33.854 --> 38:34.814
It worked.

38:34.939 --> 38:36.774
FOREMAN: No, it didn't.

38:39.318 --> 38:41.112
I told you,
you can't cure polio.

38:41.445 --> 38:44.281
It means either
she's not cured or she never had it.

38:44.407 --> 38:48.828
Since she's walking out of here,
I tested her blood from admittance.

38:48.953 --> 38:50.287
No polio.

38:50.413 --> 38:52.248
Means Brennan
screwed up the lab tests.

38:52.373 --> 38:53.791
Or you screwed up
your lab tests.

38:53.916 --> 38:55.418
You must have.
She got better.

38:55.543 --> 38:58.713
So, it's relapsing
and remitting. Maybe porphyria.

38:59.755 --> 39:01.841
Well, that's a stretch.

39:01.966 --> 39:04.218
If she had porphyria,
you'd have seen purple urine.

39:04.343 --> 39:07.263
You think it's more
likely he cured polio?

39:08.139 --> 39:10.266
Well, they believe it.

39:10.391 --> 39:13.060
Her symptoms
fit perfectly.

39:13.185 --> 39:16.313
Any alternative is
unbelievably convoluted.

39:16.439 --> 39:19.358
Some doctor would have to poison her
with thallium so it looks like polio,

39:19.483 --> 39:21.402
then fake a lab test,
then give her vitamin C

39:21.527 --> 39:25.114
and stop the poison
so she magically gets better.

39:25.239 --> 39:28.659
Actually, it is kind
of doable, right?

39:33.456 --> 39:34.498
So, what do you think?

39:34.623 --> 39:38.252
Shall we test her for thallium before
you contact Stockholm?

39:39.253 --> 39:40.796
You poisoned her?

39:41.255 --> 39:42.798
HOUSE: The really
shocking thing

39:42.923 --> 39:44.759
is that Foreman was right
about the heatstroke.

39:44.884 --> 39:47.803
Vitamin C cures polio.
I've seen it.

39:47.928 --> 39:51.057
Yeah.
In some bush clinic.

39:51.182 --> 39:53.476
You needed polio
in a place with a proper lab.

39:53.601 --> 39:57.688
The only problem is that places
with proper labs don't have polio.

39:58.689 --> 40:05.362
There is no money in finding cures for
diseases that only kill poor people.

40:06.489 --> 40:08.866
This will make
them do research.

40:11.327 --> 40:13.454
What do you care
if I faked a lab test,

40:13.579 --> 40:15.331
if it saves
a few thousand lives?

40:15.456 --> 40:17.500
I did what I had to do.

40:17.625 --> 40:20.211
Isn't that what
you hired us for?

40:25.174 --> 40:27.760
Which is why
I'm not gonna fire you.

40:28.886 --> 40:30.554
You're gonna quit.

40:31.889 --> 40:33.891
Go on, get out of here.

40:40.523 --> 40:43.275
So, you're just gonna
let him go?

40:43.400 --> 40:44.568
Absolutely.

40:45.111 --> 40:48.572
And I'm gonna let him get as far away
as possible before you call the cops.

40:48.697 --> 40:51.117
Guy's a nut job.

40:51.242 --> 40:54.286
Who the hell
did I leave in charge?

40:54.411 --> 40:55.538
Foreman.

40:55.663 --> 40:59.208
There was a reason for that.
Next time, listen to him.

41:10.427 --> 41:13.222
Where have you been?
And don't say the CIA.

41:13.472 --> 41:15.099
Okay-

41:15.349 --> 41:17.059
By the way,
one of my employees...

41:17.184 --> 41:18.936
Either you're gonna have to
get someone from the CIA

41:19.061 --> 41:20.396
to call and confirm
your story,

41:20.521 --> 41:24.608
or you're doing eight clinic hours
and Wilson is doing 16.

41:29.405 --> 41:31.574
I was in the Hamptons.

41:31.699 --> 41:36.912
I was helping some rich hedge fund jerk
treat his son's sniffles.

41:37.037 --> 41:39.331
Fascinating
as that sounds.

41:42.376 --> 41:45.838
For your honesty,
I will forgive your hours.

41:47.214 --> 41:48.465
Thank you.

41:51.468 --> 41:52.887
No!

41:54.221 --> 41:57.141
The only thing less likely
than you helping the CIA

41:57.266 --> 41:59.810
is you helping some rich guy
in Long Island.

41:59.935 --> 42:02.438
You're doing your hours
and Wilson's.

42:02.605 --> 42:04.565
I know how to
kill a man with my thumb.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.233
Who doesn't?

42:15.826 --> 42:17.036
Hi.

42:17.244 --> 42:18.412
Hi.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.838
I'm gonna take
you up on your offer.

42:28.339 --> 42:29.215
Yeah?

42:32.384 --> 42:36.096
Well, I live a couple
of miles from here.

42:37.181 --> 42:39.350
That's not the offer I meant.

42:41.227 --> 42:43.229
I gave notice today.

42:43.354 --> 42:46.273
You said you were happy
at the company.

42:46.398 --> 42:47.650
I lied.

42:47.775 --> 42:50.361
Doubt you'll
hold it against me.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.994
I'll see you
at 9:00 on Monday.
