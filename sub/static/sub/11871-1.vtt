01:10.237 --> 01:12.490
Do you think

01:12.573 --> 01:15.076
there's anything that we don't know
about each other?

01:15.117 --> 01:18.954
What a question
at six o'clock in the morning.

01:18.996 --> 01:21.248
Secrets

01:21.332 --> 01:24.752
mysteries we still hold
for each other?

01:25.628 --> 01:28.339
We are one big mystery.

01:28.380 --> 01:31.008
That is the only reason
we are together.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.010
No, come on. Answer me.

01:33.886 --> 01:37.515
It's been ages since you gave me
one of your vests.

01:39.475 --> 01:41.644
Will you be serious?

01:42.353 --> 01:45.856
Is there something I don't know
about you that I should do?

01:45.898 --> 01:49.610
The other ones have lost your scent.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.656
Then I'll wear one the next time.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.742
- At the conference?
- No, kamikaze.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.911
Sooner than that.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.164
Just whistle for me.

02:02.289 --> 02:04.542
I'll join you wherever you want.

02:11.632 --> 02:15.052
I'm sorry we can't be together
as much as we'd like.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.513
We've talked about this.

02:17.555 --> 02:21.058
It's enough that you're there.
Nothing else matters.

02:22.768 --> 02:24.812
I'll wait for you.

02:25.563 --> 02:27.690
Always.

02:33.529 --> 02:36.574
You are going to miss your flight.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.959
You never answered my question.

02:47.835 --> 02:52.923
You can talk, you're a galaxy
full of unknown stars.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.928
That's why I'll never tire
of observing you,

02:58.596 --> 03:01.599
to discover every last one of them.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.062
Well, good luck!

03:07.104 --> 03:08.856
Thanks.

03:16.238 --> 03:19.366
- See you soon my love.
- Yes please.

03:20.451 --> 03:22.453
<i>Soon, baby...</i>

03:50.147 --> 03:53.400
The correspondence

04:41.323 --> 04:44.201
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

05:45.095 --> 05:48.015
One less for you
to have to discover?

05:48.891 --> 05:53.103
Amazing! How on earth did you know
we'd talk about stars?

05:53.145 --> 05:56.899
Dexterity, my dear kamikaze,
an old man's dexterity!

06:16.293 --> 06:18.796
Cut!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.882
- Everything Ok, Amy?
- Yeah, it just hurts a little bit.

06:21.924 --> 06:25.177
You tensed up as you fell. You were
leaning too far to the right.

06:25.302 --> 06:30.265
When you land, be more flexible,
balanced, like this, yeah?

06:30.307 --> 06:33.894
- You guys Ok?
- Yeah!

06:41.652 --> 06:44.655
Hello? Am I speaking to
this world or the next?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.031
It's hard to say.

06:46.073 --> 06:50.077
- I hope the first hypothesis.
- So how did it go?

06:50.202 --> 06:53.288
- Still in one piece?
- You might be disappointed

06:53.330 --> 06:56.333
but it would indeed appear so, yeah.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.711
Ok everybody. Let's take it
from the fall to the explosion!

06:59.795 --> 07:01.839
Oh, looks like you spoke too soon.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.841
You're gonna be blown
apart all over again.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.176
You're not being very nice today.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.929
Get it into your head
that in one or many pieces,

07:08.971 --> 07:13.225
you're going to have to put up with me
for a long, long time to come.

07:13.308 --> 07:17.354
- Will eternity suffice?
- Umm, I'm not sure about that.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.731
But we can negotiate that point.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.359
- Ready to roll!
- Off you go, my love!

07:22.484 --> 07:26.363
- But don't die too much.
- Yeah, <i>I'll</i> do my best. Big kiss.

07:31.368 --> 07:35.581
- What did they ask you?
- About the formation of the galaxies.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.001
- How did you go?
- Ok. He's a nice guy, yeah.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.660
Amy Ryan! Please...

08:16.538 --> 08:18.165
Good morning.

08:18.290 --> 08:21.418
Have you finished polluting
the heavenly vaults

08:21.502 --> 08:23.545
with syncopated chopped up words?

08:24.630 --> 08:28.509
- I'm sorry professor. I'm mortified.
- All right. That's enough.

08:28.550 --> 08:32.304
Reveal to us the nature
of the god particle.

08:36.433 --> 08:40.187
The god particle is none
other than the Higgs boson,

08:40.270 --> 08:42.688
theorized in 1964.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.819
But I refuse to believe that was
a lucky strike, this time.

08:47.945 --> 08:50.822
A case of joint collective
synchronicity, I guess.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.950
- What's up on your face?
- What?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.286
Have you been making
a remake of "braveheart"?

08:56.328 --> 09:01.291
- No, I've just started painting the room.
- Well...

09:01.333 --> 09:04.086
Synchronicity or not, I'm really
glad it went so well for you.

09:04.169 --> 09:06.463
- Hello?
- When's the next exam?

09:06.588 --> 09:10.342
- What?
- I said when's your next exam?

09:10.467 --> 09:14.304
March 27th, spectral
evolution of galaxies.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.223
Wow, what a tough one!

09:16.348 --> 09:20.227
You're gonna have to do less cartwheels
and more study, my girl.

09:21.687 --> 09:25.440
- Too paternalistic.
- Ok, I might forgive you.

09:25.482 --> 09:29.861
If you tell me the title of your talk
in the conference.

09:29.945 --> 09:31.697
String theory:

09:31.738 --> 09:35.242
Literary illusion
or the theory of everything?

09:35.325 --> 09:37.995
Cosmic Harmony,
parallel universes.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.454
Exactly.

09:39.496 --> 09:42.874
And the space-time dimensions
on the basis of which

09:43.000 --> 09:45.840
we should all have ten doubles dispersed
in the infinity of multiverses.

09:45.877 --> 09:50.507
- So there are eleven of us?
- Eleven eds and eleven Amys.

09:50.632 --> 09:54.595
So even if all your clones were married,
adding up all their free time,

09:54.636 --> 09:58.515
we could be together forever.
- Yes we could.

09:58.599 --> 10:02.352
But, darling, I'm afraid I am not going
to be able to be there.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.147
- I have to do a lecture in California.
- Oh, no!

10:05.272 --> 10:08.025
When will I see you?
It's already been two months.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.777
Soon. Soon, I promise.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.363
- Soon.
- At Borgoventoso?

10:13.405 --> 10:16.491
Yeah. We haven't been there for ages.

10:16.533 --> 10:18.879
But I've got something
really awful to tell you.

10:18.904 --> 10:19.685
Hold on.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.997
Hallo?

10:22.039 --> 10:24.124
I'll be done there in five minutes.

10:26.668 --> 10:30.047
Excuse me, daddy.

10:32.924 --> 10:36.053
- What's the matter?
- I'm going to do my homework at Emily's.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.805
- See you later.
- All right.

10:38.889 --> 10:41.183
- Nicholas!
- Yes, daddy?

10:41.266 --> 10:44.269
Take it easy on the nice boy act.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.568
You were saying something awful?

10:52.069 --> 10:55.155
Yes. I've lost the keys.

10:55.197 --> 10:58.075
One of your ten doubles will probably
find them for you.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.079
- Ok, one second.
- You go, I'll hold on.

11:03.789 --> 11:05.707
- Hi.
- Ryan? Amy Ryan?

11:05.791 --> 11:07.334
Yes, that's me.

11:07.417 --> 11:10.087
- Sign.
- Thanks.

11:15.842 --> 11:17.969
An anonymous package.

11:18.095 --> 11:21.723
- Who could it be from?
- Certainly not from me,

11:21.848 --> 11:24.601
even though since I've known you
I have used

11:24.726 --> 11:27.187
that magnificent identity
from time to time.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.459
You really are a wizard!
How did you do that?

11:49.501 --> 11:52.838
Because you've already told me
that you'd lost your keys.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.716
Afraid it's a case of cryptomnesia,

11:55.757 --> 11:58.385
very rare in somebody your age.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.514
How did you get him to come here
while we were speaking about it?

12:02.597 --> 12:05.642
Collective synchronicity,
gravitational pull

12:06.476 --> 12:08.395
or just a low fashion case of luck!

12:11.898 --> 12:15.277
- I think you have to go.
- Yes, but stay there a minute.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.113
Let me look at you.

12:20.907 --> 12:23.410
You're so beautiful.

13:21.843 --> 13:24.721
- Not like the show?
- Do you?

13:28.725 --> 13:31.853
- Really sociable, your friend.
- Not half!

14:09.641 --> 14:11.518
Cut! Move it!

14:12.894 --> 14:16.773
- Are you Ok? Everything ok?
- Yeah, ok.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.609
Perfect Amy! You were great!

14:19.651 --> 14:23.363
We're doing a disembowelling scene
in about a month. Interested?

14:23.405 --> 14:25.282
- Yeah, sure thing!
- Fantastic.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.909
When she's risking her neck,
she's happy!

14:27.993 --> 14:32.038
Well, let's just say I like opening
my eyes again, afterwards.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.583
You've improved enormously.
That's enough for today.

14:55.608 --> 14:56.337
Thank you.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.149
See you next time.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.576
- You take your iPhone to bed with you?
- Why not?

15:09.701 --> 15:11.578
Anything not to have
to sleep with you.

15:11.703 --> 15:16.333
- Hey, what's up with you?
- Keep your nose out of my private life.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.835
Cool it, cool it.

15:54.371 --> 15:57.123
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.136
Hello.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.138
How are you?

16:20.397 --> 16:22.399
What? What is it?

16:30.281 --> 16:33.034
Butch! Butch!

17:26.212 --> 17:27.922
- Hello, Amy...
- Hi!

17:27.964 --> 17:30.842
- For you!
- Oh, thanks Tommy.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.054
Thanks. See you soon.

17:34.095 --> 17:35.847
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.253
My only girl

18:07.378 --> 18:10.131
today is our sixth anniversary.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.883
How could you think I'd forget?

18:11.966 --> 18:16.387
Yes, all right. I know I've seemed
to have my head in the clouds

18:16.513 --> 18:18.515
much of the time

18:18.598 --> 18:20.892
but in fact as I get closer
to hyperuranium

18:21.017 --> 18:23.394
I feel closer to you.

18:23.478 --> 18:28.399
Well, what was I lecturing
on when I first saw you?

18:28.525 --> 18:32.028
The concept of infinity
in the history of astronomy.

18:33.863 --> 18:37.617
The only truly worthwhile
symposium of my career.

18:37.659 --> 18:41.621
I remember the exact moment
when I first caught sight

18:41.663 --> 18:44.165
of your entranced expression.

18:44.290 --> 18:49.295
And I knew then,
how a lost soul must feel

18:49.420 --> 18:53.925
when it recognizes the one into whose
body it wishes to be reincarnated.

18:56.010 --> 18:58.513
And then we were together

18:58.555 --> 19:02.142
even when distance
kept us far apart.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.562
And this is how it will always be,

19:06.813 --> 19:11.818
how it's been
all these wonderful years

19:11.943 --> 19:16.197
these six most beautiful
years of my life.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.034
For me, too.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.835
So thank you, my darling,

19:29.794 --> 19:31.713
my love, my soul.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.340
Thank you for what you've given me.

19:36.342 --> 19:38.720
Take care, see you soon!

19:39.971 --> 19:41.222
Bye!

19:46.686 --> 19:49.314
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.316
Dear professor Phoerum,

19:51.357 --> 19:53.610
I don't know if you'll remember me

19:53.735 --> 19:57.113
but I'm Amy Ryan,
the kamikaze student.

19:57.238 --> 20:01.117
I wished to inform you that I've just
received your excellent lecture.

20:01.201 --> 20:03.494
I'm most grateful to you
for remembering.

20:03.620 --> 20:07.248
I hope to see you soon in order to put
to you some further questions

20:07.373 --> 20:12.086
on infinity and the new frontiers
of metempsychosis.

20:12.128 --> 20:17.008
Until then, accept my good wishes
for your work.

20:29.896 --> 20:32.523
Good morning. Welcome.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.610
Delighted to see such a lot <i>of...</i>

20:35.652 --> 20:40.281
And thank you to everyone who
has contributed to the organization

20:40.406 --> 20:44.244
of our annual conference
on astrophysics and cosmology

20:52.001 --> 20:56.547
centre for quantum
computer technology...

21:12.689 --> 21:15.191
...allow me to say a few words
about professor ed Phoerum

21:15.316 --> 21:19.070
who for many years enhanced
the life of our university

21:19.153 --> 21:21.281
with his unforgettable seminars

21:21.322 --> 21:23.825
and who just a few days ago

21:23.950 --> 21:27.704
regrettably, passed away.

21:33.459 --> 21:37.213
It was only last week

21:37.338 --> 21:38.965
that he called me from Edinburgh,

21:39.048 --> 21:43.594
to tell me that he wouldn't be able
to make this conference.

21:46.055 --> 21:50.351
I wonder if you would all rise

21:50.435 --> 21:53.604
and observe a minute of silence

21:53.688 --> 21:58.318
for our colleague,
for a wonderful man.

21:59.569 --> 22:02.989
A colleague and a dear friend.

22:03.740 --> 22:06.451
- Ed Phoerum.
- Excuse me.

22:12.874 --> 22:15.626
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.

22:15.752 --> 22:17.503
I'm sorry, professor,

22:17.587 --> 22:18.838
it's Amy Ryan again.

22:18.880 --> 22:22.383
I need to speak to you urgently.
Anyway, I'll try again later.

22:26.888 --> 22:28.848
Hello?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.477
Hello?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.647
Hello?

22:41.861 --> 22:44.530
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.

23:03.424 --> 23:05.676
- Hello?
- Amy, at long last!

23:05.802 --> 23:09.180
I've been trying to reach you for days.
I dreamt about you last night.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.933
- Yes, I'll call you back.
- Wait, Amy! Don't hang up!

23:19.273 --> 23:21.317
His exceptional gifts
as a popularizer...

23:22.443 --> 23:24.946
According to Phoerum
and many other astrophysicists...

23:27.573 --> 23:29.951
Lectures and seminars
all over the world...

23:30.910 --> 23:35.039
Professor ed Phoerum
died on 15th of January,

23:35.081 --> 23:37.708
but only today did his family...

23:39.710 --> 23:41.712
15th of January?

24:00.857 --> 24:04.360
My only girl, today
is our sixth anniversary.

24:04.444 --> 24:07.238
How could you think I'd forget?

24:07.321 --> 24:10.992
Yes, all right. I know I've seemed
to have my head in the clouds...

24:38.769 --> 24:42.648
My sweet Amy, suddenly I felt
the need to write to you.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.484
We chat everyday but...

24:44.525 --> 24:48.154
I miss the excitement of holding
in my arms the same piece of paper

24:48.279 --> 24:50.114
you'd lain yours on.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.283
Of knowing you'll hold my letter

24:52.408 --> 24:54.494
and stop whatever it was you
were doing to read it.

24:54.535 --> 24:57.121
Hello. The first flight
to Edinburgh, please.

24:57.163 --> 25:01.250
So here I am wondering
what you're doing right now...

25:01.292 --> 25:04.921
Where are you?
How should I picture you?

25:05.046 --> 25:07.006
What are you looking at?

25:07.048 --> 25:10.426
I feel like missing the whole
world around you,

25:10.551 --> 25:12.678
almost as much
as I miss you yourself.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.056
Take care, my lovely girl.

25:15.181 --> 25:18.267
See you soon. Your ed.

25:19.393 --> 25:22.647
Edinburgh, January 20th, 2015.

25:50.341 --> 25:53.219
I'm unavailable right now,
please leave a message.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.703
Is it you who's looking
for professor Phoerum?

27:10.728 --> 27:11.446
Yes.

27:11.505 --> 27:15.301
- I haven't heard from him for some time.
- Doesn't he teach here?

27:15.426 --> 27:17.303
Oh, not anymore.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.931
I know he wasn't well. But why
are you looking for him?

28:22.827 --> 28:25.204
I'm sorry, I can't find him.

28:25.246 --> 28:28.017
Have you checked to the
graveyards in the city?

28:28.042 --> 28:29.023
Yes, I have.

28:29.083 --> 28:32.128
- But there's no record.
- And you're sure he's deceased?

28:42.346 --> 28:44.390
Oh, hang on. I'm sorry.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.143
Here he is. Edward Phoerum.

28:47.226 --> 28:51.397
In fact, there's no grave but he
was cremated on the 20th of January.

28:57.027 --> 28:58.654
Thank you.

29:59.173 --> 30:01.717
My love, if you're the girl I know,

30:01.801 --> 30:04.929
I guess you'll be going
to my home town

30:04.970 --> 30:07.056
exploring my old homes.

30:07.097 --> 30:09.308
If that's right,
if I'm not mistaken

30:09.350 --> 30:12.603
please go to the offices
of Glen Durrell

30:12.728 --> 30:15.314
...342 Newington street.

30:15.356 --> 30:18.317
I'm thinking of you
and hugging you.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.612
I will never abandon you. Your ed.

30:29.370 --> 30:31.747
Please, sign here.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.887
So professor Phoerum isn't...

30:47.638 --> 30:49.390
<i>Isn't...</i>

30:51.141 --> 30:53.269
Unfortunately.

30:53.352 --> 30:55.229
Shortly before he died,

30:55.271 --> 30:58.774
he left me something
in fiduciary deposit for you.

31:07.867 --> 31:13.247
If there's anything I can do,
don't hesitate to call.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.418
Hello Amy,
this belonged to my dad.

31:59.460 --> 32:02.546
He wore it for every university exam

32:02.588 --> 32:05.674
and never failed one.
I wore it after him.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.802
I'm sure it'll work for you.

32:08.844 --> 32:11.805
I will love you anyway,
everywhere, forever.

32:11.847 --> 32:13.682
Your ed.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.012
Miss! Miss!

32:52.137 --> 32:54.139
You forgot this.

33:03.023 --> 33:05.401
- Miss Amy Ryan?
- Yes.

33:05.526 --> 33:07.653
You're the last one.

33:24.795 --> 33:26.755
Hello Amy.

33:26.797 --> 33:30.384
You know, I'm beginning to get it.

33:30.426 --> 33:35.305
I mean, the reason why when
you cross to the other side

33:35.389 --> 33:38.267
the first thing you lose
is the right to speak.

33:38.308 --> 33:40.060
Because...

33:40.185 --> 33:43.897
Because you don't have a clue
where the fuck to begin...

33:47.818 --> 33:50.404
Yeah, I know what you're thinking.

33:50.446 --> 33:52.406
I know perfectly well.

33:52.448 --> 33:54.575
Why didn't I tell you.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.329
Why didn't I tell you?

33:59.955 --> 34:03.459
Well, because it
seemed pointless,

34:03.542 --> 34:05.669
inappropriate, I mean,
out of tune.

34:05.711 --> 34:12.092
Something that should
have no part of us,

34:12.176 --> 34:14.053
something that had nothing
to do with us

34:15.054 --> 34:18.223
and which, at the end of the day,
hasn't happened.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.356
Besides that, I didn't want
to see you suffer.

34:30.110 --> 34:33.864
You'll think it's easy for me now,
not seeing your pain.

34:33.947 --> 34:36.116
And you're right, it is easy,

34:36.199 --> 34:40.120
but you know I have always
been a lucky devil.

34:40.204 --> 34:43.748
On the other hand, I am sorry not
to be able to get your messages.

34:43.873 --> 34:46.085
But who knows,

34:47.127 --> 34:50.755
maybe our doubles
will come up with something.

34:53.007 --> 34:55.344
Who knows? Let's see.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.222
In my own small way,

34:58.263 --> 35:00.641
I've been putting a lot of thoughts
into this lately.

35:00.724 --> 35:03.227
So you'll see,

35:04.269 --> 35:08.273
your old wizard won't abandon you
without a struggle.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.987
But I don't want to become
one of those ghosts

35:14.029 --> 35:16.281
who end up in a kind of limbo,

35:16.406 --> 35:19.660
just being a pain in the arse
to those they leave behind.

35:19.785 --> 35:23.914
When you get fed up with
my existential stubbornness

35:23.997 --> 35:27.918
you'll send an email to my address

35:28.001 --> 35:33.006
with your own name
repeated eleven times.

35:33.048 --> 35:34.883
Just that.

35:36.260 --> 35:38.137
Then I'll leave you in peace.

35:53.152 --> 35:55.529
- What's going on?
- Ls there a problem?

35:58.699 --> 36:01.410
- Everything all right?
- Uhm...

36:01.451 --> 36:03.328
Ok, we're done.

36:32.107 --> 36:33.984
Are you Ok, Amy?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.327
UK, got it'?

36:43.368 --> 36:45.621
- Be careful.
- Ok.

37:09.978 --> 37:13.106
She moved.
The cast isn't right.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.276
- The face stands out very badly...
- Hey, something up?

37:17.486 --> 37:19.988
No, no. Everything's fine.

37:20.030 --> 37:22.115
- Sorry.
- Sit down.

37:24.243 --> 37:30.540
- It's terrible in there, I know.
- I felt I was suffocating.

37:30.624 --> 37:34.169
A day's work wasted.
We'll have to re-do the whole thing.

37:34.294 --> 37:37.923
She must stay completely still.
She can't shed tears.

37:38.006 --> 37:40.550
If the body is ok,
let's just do the head, eh?

37:40.676 --> 37:44.054
No short-cuts, guys.
The whole body.

37:46.139 --> 37:49.017
If you don't feel like it,
I'll get someone else.

37:49.059 --> 37:52.020
It's all right, I'll do it again.

37:56.692 --> 37:58.777
Closing time!

39:20.525 --> 39:23.403
Excuse me, but this arrived
for you a few days ago.

39:23.487 --> 39:25.739
We were going to forward it to
your home address but since you are here...

39:25.781 --> 39:28.033
- Thank you.
- Good evening.

39:50.055 --> 39:52.557
Forgive me, kamikaze, I forgot.

39:52.641 --> 39:54.518
Big kiss. Your ed.

40:32.180 --> 40:34.349
If my memory hasn't failed me,

40:34.433 --> 40:38.103
you've got to take an exam today
on the spectral evolution of the galaxies.

40:38.228 --> 40:40.814
Have you studied
hard enough? I hope so.

40:40.856 --> 40:43.483
If I happened to be your examiner,

40:43.567 --> 40:45.694
I'd ask you about
the statistical fluctuations

40:45.735 --> 40:48.113
of the tonry-Schneider method,

40:48.238 --> 40:51.491
because I know
you like that subject.

40:52.242 --> 40:54.453
Anyway fingers crossed,

40:54.494 --> 40:57.497
I'll try calling you later.
Kisses, ed.

41:02.878 --> 41:05.755
I see here you have excellent marks.

41:06.882 --> 41:10.844
So why the long face?
What's on your mind?

41:11.720 --> 41:13.513
Nothing.

41:13.638 --> 41:16.475
Not enough sleep, maybe. Sorry.

41:18.518 --> 41:20.645
I'd like to help you.

41:20.729 --> 41:24.024
Pick any subject, of your choice.

41:24.107 --> 41:27.736
Statistical fluctuations
in the stellar populations...

41:27.777 --> 41:32.616
- And the tonry-Schneider method.
- Excellent choice. Go ahead.

41:37.537 --> 41:39.539
Impossible.

41:47.756 --> 41:51.551
Hello Nicholas, today
is your eighteenth birthday.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.803
I couldn't miss it,
certainly not this one.

41:53.887 --> 41:58.183
I've no doubt you're turning
into a fine young man.

41:58.266 --> 42:01.311
But if you've followed
your instinct to ignore

42:01.394 --> 42:03.396
all that good advice I've given
you over the years,

42:03.438 --> 42:06.066
then I've no worries for your future.

42:06.149 --> 42:08.443
But a father is a father

42:08.568 --> 42:11.196
and can't help doling out
wise counsel to his children...

42:11.279 --> 42:13.657
Miss Ryan! This is for you.

42:13.698 --> 42:15.700
Oh, thank you.

42:15.825 --> 42:17.702
Sign here, please.

42:17.786 --> 42:20.830
But I'm comforted by the fact that
I know you'll go your own way,

42:20.914 --> 42:24.084
I have faith in you,
and your intelligence.

42:29.089 --> 42:32.092
All you've got to do is blow on it
and it Springs open.

42:32.217 --> 42:36.555
How many times I have got to tell you!

42:36.596 --> 42:38.557
I'll change the lock on Monday.
It's all arranged.

42:38.598 --> 42:41.226
Darling, I know you
too well to think

42:41.351 --> 42:44.479
that the exam didn't go
anything but brilliantly,

42:44.604 --> 42:46.982
so let's take that for granted.
Congratulations.

42:47.065 --> 42:48.984
You deserve a present

42:49.109 --> 42:54.239
but you have to go to Borgoventoso
to get it, on April the 9th

42:54.322 --> 42:56.491
as usual.

42:57.701 --> 43:00.495
In the envelope you'll find
the umpteenth set of keys.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.497
Just in case!

43:03.331 --> 43:05.125
Big kiss.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.252
Talk soon. Your ed.

43:34.779 --> 43:37.365
- Good morning, miss.
- Good morning.

43:37.866 --> 43:39.618
Let you go.

43:49.419 --> 43:51.296
And the professor?

43:53.381 --> 43:55.425
Always late.

43:58.386 --> 44:01.640
Let me know when
I have to come for him.

44:03.892 --> 44:05.810
Fine, Ottavio.

44:06.811 --> 44:09.898
Last time he wasn't too happy.

44:11.316 --> 44:14.444
Too many people
trooping to his door.

44:17.072 --> 44:19.032
What people?

44:19.074 --> 44:20.784
Never saw them before.

44:22.077 --> 44:24.204
A man and a woman,

44:26.331 --> 44:28.458
then a younger man.

44:28.541 --> 44:30.960
With bits of equipment.

44:33.213 --> 44:35.965
I was never away from the pier,

44:36.091 --> 44:41.471
waiting for you, miss, but...

44:42.347 --> 44:46.351
Maybe that's why the professor
looked out of sorts.

46:09.517 --> 46:11.561
Anybody here?

47:53.288 --> 47:55.290
Welcome home my darling.

47:55.373 --> 47:58.376
Thank you for coming today
on my birthday, as always.

47:58.418 --> 48:01.421
<i>Happy birthday to me,
happy birthday to me,</i>

48:01.504 --> 48:06.926
<i>happy birthday dear Edward,
happy birthday to me.</i>

48:11.931 --> 48:14.392
But today the present is for you

48:14.434 --> 48:17.812
so at last you can stop fighting
with your laptop.

48:17.896 --> 48:19.898
How do I look?

48:19.939 --> 48:23.443
Gorgeus, don't I?
Well, I'm gorgeous.

48:23.568 --> 48:26.321
You know, all things considered,

48:26.404 --> 48:29.198
it's the same being here
as being there.

48:29.908 --> 48:34.454
Except that I don't get
to touch you and I miss that.

48:37.916 --> 48:40.793
No point dwelling on this, I agree.

48:41.920 --> 48:44.088
But remember what I said.

48:44.172 --> 48:49.594
When I get too much for you
to deal with, you know what to do.

48:49.677 --> 48:52.972
Your name, eleven times.

49:16.871 --> 49:20.124
- Amy, I was expecting you.
- Of course.

49:20.208 --> 49:22.502
It's April 9th.

49:22.627 --> 49:25.630
I was sure you would come!
Come in! Come in!

49:26.714 --> 49:28.383
The table is ready.

49:28.466 --> 49:30.635
The professor was very insistent.

49:30.718 --> 49:32.762
Everything as before.

49:33.388 --> 49:37.475
The music, the menu, the cake.

49:47.902 --> 49:49.654
Thank you.

49:49.779 --> 49:53.282
We're all sorry here in the village,
but in a way we expected it.

49:53.366 --> 49:57.870
We hadn't seen him
for months and months

49:57.912 --> 50:01.499
and then suddenly he staid
for the whole season.

50:02.291 --> 50:06.295
We shall look on it as one
of his longer absences.

50:37.785 --> 50:39.454
Do you know what it was?

50:42.165 --> 50:46.085
The last time he stayed
nearly two weeks.

50:46.210 --> 50:48.463
There was a doctor

50:48.546 --> 50:50.339
and I heard them talking.

50:52.091 --> 50:54.218
Nasty word.

50:54.302 --> 50:56.429
Astrocytoma.

50:59.974 --> 51:02.351
You know, one day ed said to me:

51:02.477 --> 51:06.355
"If you live with your head
among the stars

51:06.481 --> 51:11.360
sooner or later one
will lodge in your brain."

51:16.616 --> 51:20.828
- How did he spend his days?
- Writing, always writing.

51:20.870 --> 51:23.498
Letters, notes, messages...

51:23.581 --> 51:27.085
On his computer, on his mobile,
with his camcorder.

51:27.126 --> 51:29.504
He never stopped

51:29.629 --> 51:33.966
though he had trouble with his eyes.
He complained a lot.

51:35.218 --> 51:37.345
Eat up, it's getting cold!

53:00.553 --> 53:02.972
Good morning, Amy.

53:04.599 --> 53:06.559
Hello, Angela.

53:08.936 --> 53:12.857
- The village is more deserted than before.
- Yes, it is.

53:12.982 --> 53:16.319
He'd be happy to know you're here.

53:16.360 --> 53:19.864
He was a different man
when he spoke about you.

53:19.947 --> 53:21.949
His eyes would light up.

53:21.991 --> 53:26.579
The only time I saw him look strange
was that last day.

53:26.621 --> 53:29.832
In the morning he went
to sit on the black rock.

53:29.874 --> 53:33.336
He leaned his back against it.

53:33.377 --> 53:36.505
He looked out at the horizon all day

53:36.631 --> 53:38.591
until nightfall.

53:38.633 --> 53:40.635
Who knows?

54:28.641 --> 54:33.688
It's true, I'm looking at the reflection
you saw, but...

55:14.478 --> 55:16.230
Ed!

55:27.241 --> 55:29.994
- Ed!
- Amy, it's me.

55:30.119 --> 55:32.246
Sorry I woke you.

55:36.334 --> 55:40.338
- I wasn't asleep anyway.
- You've caught me in the act.

55:40.379 --> 55:43.507
The professors was so specific:

55:43.591 --> 55:46.594
"If Amy stays more than two days,

55:46.635 --> 55:50.014
put this on her table, without
letting yourself be seen."

55:50.139 --> 55:54.518
- I didn't manage too well. I'm sorry.
- No problem.

55:54.643 --> 55:59.148
When you're out at lunch,
I'll drop by to tidy up.

56:09.283 --> 56:11.369
Hi, kamikaze.

56:12.912 --> 56:15.664
I'm glad you stayed on
in Borgoventoso.

56:15.748 --> 56:18.376
You know my soul resides there.

56:18.417 --> 56:22.797
I've never brought
anyone else except you.

56:24.757 --> 56:29.512
I wonder if it's one of those days
when the light on the water

56:29.553 --> 56:32.431
makes you feel you're
in another dimension.

56:32.556 --> 56:36.936
Or if it's one of every colour
turns grey

56:37.019 --> 56:40.189
and you feel in the world's shadow.

56:41.941 --> 56:44.193
I've no way of knowing.

56:44.276 --> 56:49.824
I think I do know what it is that you
have been keeping secret from me.

56:49.907 --> 56:53.577
You mustn't get upset if I talk about it.

56:54.578 --> 56:57.706
I would have done so,
sooner or later anyway.

56:58.541 --> 57:00.668
Your advantage now

57:00.709 --> 57:04.338
is that if you don't like listening
to my paternalistic ramblings

57:04.463 --> 57:07.716
you can just switch me off,
any time you want,

57:07.842 --> 57:09.969
get rid of me all together.

57:12.304 --> 57:14.723
I'm talking about your parents.

57:15.599 --> 57:18.602
I've always felt your discomfort
with this subject,

57:18.727 --> 57:23.607
so I've never forced you,
but I think now is the time.

57:23.691 --> 57:25.943
For you and for your own good.

57:27.486 --> 57:31.615
Lately, your mother
has been phoning you

57:31.699 --> 57:33.742
a lot.

57:33.826 --> 57:37.872
And I suspect as usual
you never call her back.

57:40.332 --> 57:42.751
Well, I have a confession to make.

57:44.378 --> 57:48.632
After our last time together,
I went to see her.

57:51.760 --> 57:54.138
She's very welcoming.

57:54.263 --> 57:58.767
Don't worry, I didn't...
I didn't tell her about us.

57:59.518 --> 58:02.396
Although, I can't rule out
that she did understand

58:02.521 --> 58:05.274
more than I was trying to keep back.

58:05.357 --> 58:08.777
Perhaps that's why she confided
in me so much about you

58:08.861 --> 58:13.991
about the accident,

58:16.744 --> 58:19.872
your feelings of guilt.

58:19.914 --> 58:21.624
Stop it!

58:22.666 --> 58:24.919
You think she hates you

58:25.044 --> 58:28.297
because she'd rather you had died
instead of your father.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.174
Is that it?

58:30.925 --> 58:32.760
Stop it!

59:01.080 --> 59:02.957
Amy.

59:03.082 --> 59:07.086
She's suffering because of your
accusation. She misses you.

59:10.047 --> 59:14.969
I know you detest me at this moment,
but I have to say this.

59:16.178 --> 59:19.723
Now I understand why you like
to submit yourself

59:19.848 --> 59:22.726
to that atrocity on films.

59:22.810 --> 59:26.605
- Stop it!
- You'd like to disappear yourself,

59:28.357 --> 59:31.569
but instead it's those
around you who vanish.

59:31.610 --> 59:36.240
I admit, I'm not too original in this.

59:36.365 --> 59:38.867
But I promise I won't do it again.

59:38.951 --> 59:43.330
- So listen to me, my darling..
- Stop it!

59:43.372 --> 59:46.458
Stop it! Stop it!

01:00:23.662 --> 01:00:28.292
One, two, three, four,

01:00:29.168 --> 01:00:31.420
five, six,

01:00:32.421 --> 01:00:34.548
seven, eight,

01:00:35.633 --> 01:00:39.511
nine, ten, eleven...

01:01:47.746 --> 01:01:49.748
What the hell's going on?! Cut!

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.583
Hey, release it.

01:01:51.625 --> 01:01:53.961
She's got to stay there for longer.

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:58.090
- How many times do I have to say this?
- It was perfect, Amy.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:01.385
But you need to hang there
without moving for a bit longer.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.263
The clasp broke.
I was actually beginning to suffocate.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:07.141
Come on, Amy, that is easy.
We're behind schedule,

01:02:07.266 --> 01:02:11.103
- for fuck's sake!
- Oh, you really want me to die?

01:02:11.145 --> 01:02:15.357
Hey, no argument, please.
We have got to do it again, all right?

01:02:15.399 --> 01:02:17.526
- Please get ready!
- Easy, Amy, take it easy...

01:02:17.609 --> 01:02:20.362
Yeah, Ok, "easy!"
I'm through with this!

01:02:20.404 --> 01:02:22.406
You've pissed me off!

01:02:22.531 --> 01:02:25.284
You go hang yourselves!

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.369
Fuck off, you bunch of shits!

01:02:48.265 --> 01:02:50.434
One, two, three,

01:02:50.559 --> 01:02:53.312
four, five, six,

01:02:53.395 --> 01:02:57.941
seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.

01:03:35.687 --> 01:03:37.815
My darling wizard,

01:03:38.982 --> 01:03:43.987
when you were writing your letters
and recording your videos,

01:03:45.572 --> 01:03:49.368
you knew that, one way or another,

01:03:50.619 --> 01:03:52.454
I'd get them and see them.

01:03:55.249 --> 01:04:00.462
Right now I know you'll never
receive my replies

01:04:03.757 --> 01:04:06.385
but I'm going to try anyhow.

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:12.516
For my own sake.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.901
As long as you were here,

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:27.865
a galaxy of my life held together
to some extent,

01:04:32.286 --> 01:04:37.124
but now it's crumbling into nothingness
and there's no stopping it.

01:04:40.419 --> 01:04:43.297
If I have cut off
your correspondence,

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:47.009
it wasn't because
I didn't need you any more.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:50.512
Quite the reverse,

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:55.434
in fact I am devoured with remorse.

01:05:14.703 --> 01:05:16.413
Even though I flattened out the disc,

01:05:16.455 --> 01:05:19.333
the support system is too degenerated.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:22.794
I tried with a very special method.
I managed to transcribe the data,

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:25.589
but the content is damaged
beyond repair.

01:05:25.714 --> 01:05:29.217
The whole thing is like that,
including the sound.

01:05:29.927 --> 01:05:35.098
- And there's no other way?
- Afraid not. Sorry.

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.935
Ok, thanks.

01:05:39.937 --> 01:05:43.565
Bring in the camcorder.
The whole recording will be there.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.985
- Hey, what can I do for you?
- Hi.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.988
It's about the deliveries you've
been making to my place

01:05:50.113 --> 01:05:51.740
for the last few months.

01:05:51.823 --> 01:05:54.618
Could you tell me when you got
the packages

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:56.954
- sure. Ryan, right?
- Yes, yes.

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.998
Ryan. Here we are.

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:03.961
Ok, everything was brought
in on the 10th of January.

01:06:04.002 --> 01:06:06.630
How did you know when
to deliver the individual items?

01:06:06.755 --> 01:06:10.258
The sender, one ed Phoerum,

01:06:10.342 --> 01:06:12.511
left a set of delivery dates

01:06:12.594 --> 01:06:16.640
and we just went along with his schedule.
Why? Ls something wrong?

01:06:16.723 --> 01:06:19.393
No, no. Everything's fine.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:24.022
Oh, hang on. We had three
other parcels and six envelopes

01:06:24.147 --> 01:06:27.609
but last week we got an order
to return the lot to sender.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:31.863
- What order? From whom?
- From ed Phoerum.

01:06:39.287 --> 01:06:41.540
<i>Hi.</i>

01:06:46.378 --> 01:06:48.422
Butch! Come on!

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:07.691
- Hello, mum...
- Amy, you never answer!

01:07:07.774 --> 01:07:12.029
- Have you had any more dreams?
- Yes, but I won't tell you about them

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.406
because you're avoiding me.

01:07:14.448 --> 01:07:16.517
So we're switching
roles now, is that it'?

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:17.600
What do you mean?

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:22.581
I miss your presence,

01:07:22.664 --> 01:07:26.960
I miss wanting to keep back things
you don't know about me,

01:07:27.044 --> 01:07:29.087
because then I can just
spring them on you,

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:31.715
whenever I choose

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:37.471
knowing that you'd have listened,

01:07:39.097 --> 01:07:42.350
understood and helped me

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:46.354
as you always did.

01:07:46.438 --> 01:07:49.316
I know how absurd it is,

01:07:49.357 --> 01:07:51.860
but just because you can't hear me

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:54.696
today I want to make the effort

01:07:54.738 --> 01:07:58.325
to tell you things
that I've never told anyone.

01:07:59.618 --> 01:08:02.370
To be honest, your questions
don't surprise me unduly.

01:08:02.454 --> 01:08:04.748
So what is it that embarrasses you?

01:08:04.831 --> 01:08:07.709
Well, I've known ed
since he was at school.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:11.004
When he gave me all that stuff

01:08:11.088 --> 01:08:13.840
to forward on specific days chosen
by him, I didn't ask <i>to...</i>

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:16.384
You only gave me one package.

01:08:16.468 --> 01:08:18.595
Why do you talk
about "all that stuff"?

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:25.519
I suppose you've recently received
quite a number of things from ed.

01:08:25.602 --> 01:08:29.731
Apart from emails and other messages
that I can't even begin to imagine.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:35.028
You should know everything
was dispatched from here.

01:08:35.153 --> 01:08:40.242
But I repeat, I didn't ask to know
the content of those envelopes.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.368
Ed was ed.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.913
I would never let him down but,

01:08:46.038 --> 01:08:49.917
please, I can't say any more.

01:08:53.046 --> 01:08:55.924
Can't even tell me if
you've posted everything?

01:08:56.049 --> 01:09:00.428
I've received notice to stop
dealing with the mail.

01:09:00.511 --> 01:09:03.014
- From whom?
- From ed.

01:09:03.932 --> 01:09:06.685
Or at least,
from the system he set up

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:10.063
to keep his will alive

01:09:10.147 --> 01:09:13.316
but evidently not everything
went as it should.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.908
So you still have material
destined for me.

01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:27.080
Yes, but I can't hand it over to you,

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:30.709
unless ed Phoerum asks me to.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:35.462
- Do you think he'll ask?
- Please believe me.

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:39.926
If I knew I'd tell you.

01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:46.308
I can assure you of one thing.

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:51.229
In all my life I've never seen a man
as deeply in love as him.

01:10:08.705 --> 01:10:10.582
One, two, three, four,

01:10:10.624 --> 01:10:12.334
five, six, seven,

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:14.377
eight, nine, ten, eleven...

01:10:42.364 --> 01:10:44.366
Hello?

01:10:44.407 --> 01:10:47.869
I was just wondering
what'd happened to you.

01:10:47.911 --> 01:10:50.538
I wasn't even twenty years old.

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:55.377
Dad and I took the oar to go
and see my grandparents.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.797
I was driving.

01:10:59.631 --> 01:11:02.759
Dad said I was managing fine
at the wheel.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:04.928
He liked speed.

01:11:05.804 --> 01:11:07.430
So did I.

01:11:10.392 --> 01:11:12.560
Out of nowhere,

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:17.148
on a straight road we'd driven
on thousands of times before,

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.693
I lost control of the car.

01:11:19.776 --> 01:11:23.780
Maybe because the road was wet,

01:11:27.033 --> 01:11:30.161
or maybe because I was overdoing it
with the accelerator.

01:11:35.709 --> 01:11:37.961
I went off the road.

01:11:39.671 --> 01:11:43.341
The car rolled over down
a steep embankment.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:51.850
I don't know how, but I managed
to get my door open

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.227
and throw myself out.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:12:02.110
A clump of bushes softened
the blow and I was unhurt.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:10.952
But my dad

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.748
my dad

01:12:14.873 --> 01:12:17.250
my dad

01:12:19.711 --> 01:12:22.213
he was trapped inside.

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:29.512
I couldn't do anything.

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.390
Anything-

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:36.353
I couldn't do anything.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.373
Hello?

01:12:57.165 --> 01:12:59.167
Hello?

01:12:59.667 --> 01:13:01.669
Hello?

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.704
Hello?

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:03.857
- Yes.
- I know exactly who you are

01:14:03.982 --> 01:14:05.733
and you know exactly who I am.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:09.237
- So what do you think you're playing at'?
- I'm sorry.

01:14:10.363 --> 01:14:12.615
- It's just that...
- Ls what?

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:33.094
- Miss Phoerum?
- Yes.

01:14:34.971 --> 01:14:37.515
It's me. I'm Amy Ryan.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:42.645
Yes, of course.

01:14:44.105 --> 01:14:46.274
I've seen photos of you.

01:14:47.484 --> 01:14:50.737
And I recognised you outside
my house in January.

01:14:57.869 --> 01:14:59.913
Nice to meet you.

01:15:01.164 --> 01:15:03.416
Yes, January.

01:15:04.417 --> 01:15:06.544
I was very confused.

01:15:07.629 --> 01:15:09.672
Thank you.

01:15:13.384 --> 01:15:15.803
I was waiting there.

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:20.058
I was hoping to find out
it was all untrue.

01:15:20.183 --> 01:15:24.270
- But I didn't want to bother you.
- So, what are you looking for now?

01:15:24.312 --> 01:15:26.189
Understanding?

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.776
- No, <i>no...</i>
- Consolation, then?

01:15:31.694 --> 01:15:33.905
What would you like?

01:15:33.947 --> 01:15:36.950
- Green tea, please.
- Nothing for me.

01:15:38.201 --> 01:15:41.538
I don't think it was a good idea
for us to meet.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:46.417
I've never thought the day would
come when I could meet you.

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:50.088
Because I've hated you
from a distance.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:56.469
You're fully entitled to,
miss Phoerum.

01:15:56.553 --> 01:15:59.347
Please, no need for formality,
we are the same age.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.474
Three months difference.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:04.852
You're a bit older.

01:16:09.232 --> 01:16:11.818
It was only the existence
of my brother

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.736
which prevented ed
from abandoning us.

01:16:13.987 --> 01:16:16.739
If I were you I wouldn't be so sure.

01:16:19.826 --> 01:16:23.871
My mother and me,
yes, he loved us

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.836
but evidently it wasn't us
who kept him balanced.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:38.261
You've nothing to say'?

01:16:39.387 --> 01:16:43.474
Anything I say now would
be completely useless.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:47.895
I can only swear that I've always
respected what ed wanted.

01:16:47.979 --> 01:16:50.898
I never forced him
to tear his life apart.

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.404
I was happy with fragments of his time.

01:16:56.487 --> 01:16:58.531
It wasn't easy,

01:17:00.408 --> 01:17:03.494
but I've never hated anyone of you.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:07.665
Good.

01:17:07.749 --> 01:17:10.627
Now you can just vanish
and leave us in peace.

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:14.172
My father is no more.

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:16.299
Do you understand?

01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:19.886
Stop searching for him

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:23.640
and stop sending
these absurd messages.

01:17:23.681 --> 01:17:25.933
Ed is dead.

01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:49.082
This is the explosion
of a supernova 1987a,

01:17:49.165 --> 01:17:51.209
the expansion of its mass and

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:53.961
finally, its dissolution
into nothingness.

01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:58.841
Professor Phoerum was thrilled
whenever he discovered one.

01:17:58.925 --> 01:18:02.345
Could you tell me what his
last field of study was?

01:18:20.071 --> 01:18:22.365
There's no need
for a telescope anymore,

01:18:22.490 --> 01:18:24.575
but sometimes
the professor enjoyed it.

01:18:24.617 --> 01:18:26.452
Look carefully.

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:31.374
- The crab nebula!
- Exactly.

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:34.210
It's still visible today since 1054.

01:18:34.961 --> 01:18:39.882
Latterly the professor spent a lot of time
observing the crab nebula.

01:18:39.966 --> 01:18:41.342
Why that one in particular?

01:18:41.384 --> 01:18:45.763
Because he thought it had
the same shape as his astrocytoma.

01:19:03.906 --> 01:19:07.410
Ed talked to me a lot about you,
in those final days.

01:19:07.535 --> 01:19:12.665
I can imagine how much
that fed your hate with.

01:19:12.749 --> 01:19:14.667
A bit.

01:19:16.878 --> 01:19:18.880
But I'm gonna surprise you.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.923
As he went on with these stories,

01:19:21.007 --> 01:19:24.051
fragmented and mangled
by the illness,

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:28.181
my hostility towards you
changed into envy.

01:19:28.306 --> 01:19:30.141
- Envy?
- Yes.

01:19:30.183 --> 01:19:32.560
The more I heard him
talk about you,

01:19:32.685 --> 01:19:37.940
the more I realised that no man would
ever love me in the same way.

01:19:41.944 --> 01:19:44.530
Yes, the truth is I do envy you

01:19:46.949 --> 01:19:49.076
and I'd like to help you,

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:52.663
but I don't know how.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:58.336
Why didn't ed want to tell me anything
about what was going to happen?

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:01.422
He tried to conceal it from us too,

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:03.466
but he couldn't keep it up for long.

01:20:03.591 --> 01:20:05.218
We found out quite quickly.

01:20:05.343 --> 01:20:08.304
With you, distance helped him.

01:20:09.055 --> 01:20:11.933
I don't know, I think he wanted
to protect you.

01:20:13.601 --> 01:20:16.979
He tried to predict every move
in your life for three months,

01:20:17.063 --> 01:20:19.690
so as to be at your side,
to be there for you.

01:20:20.233 --> 01:20:22.318
He looked at it from every angle.

01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:25.988
He wanted to show himself
immortal for you.

01:20:28.241 --> 01:20:30.368
He almost succeeded.

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:34.121
- Then I just ruined everything.
- I know.

01:20:34.247 --> 01:20:37.875
I wonder if he also devised
a way to,

01:20:37.959 --> 01:20:42.129
to revive his communication network.
- I don't know.

01:20:42.213 --> 01:20:44.257
He did it all by himself.

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:49.971
But I can give you this.

01:20:51.347 --> 01:20:53.140
Oh, it's his camcorder.

01:20:53.266 --> 01:20:56.227
Doctor Sobieski, who took care
of my father until the end,

01:20:56.269 --> 01:20:58.104
he gave it to me.

01:20:59.772 --> 01:21:01.858
I haven't even switched it on.

01:21:11.617 --> 01:21:16.414
I can't accept the idea that you
won't give me another chance <i>to...</i>

01:21:16.539 --> 01:21:21.377
To enjoy hearing all the words
you addressed to me,

01:21:23.796 --> 01:21:26.883
and that I was stupid enough to delete.

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:35.516
- Excuse me, are you doctor Sobieski?
- Yes but I'm in a hurry.

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.394
You can make an appointment
at the reception desk.

01:21:38.436 --> 01:21:40.438
My name is Amy Ryan.

01:21:43.441 --> 01:21:45.568
Here I used to see him every day,

01:21:45.651 --> 01:21:49.447
but I only went to Borgoventoso
at weekends, for his therapy.

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:53.701
Why did he stay there, so far from anyone
who could look after him?

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:57.163
I did all I could to discourage him
but it was no good.

01:21:57.204 --> 01:22:00.833
"I have to organize
my future life" he'd say,

01:22:00.958 --> 01:22:03.920
"I don't want anyone in my way"
and he'd laugh.

01:22:05.212 --> 01:22:08.174
Did he ever talk to you about me?

01:22:11.552 --> 01:22:13.471
Very rarely.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.222
Offhand comments but,

01:22:15.306 --> 01:22:18.601
believe me Amy,
he wrote letter after letter,

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:24.690
composed streams of emails, recorded
and edited hours of filming,

01:22:24.732 --> 01:22:27.818
transformed the email software.

01:22:27.860 --> 01:22:29.987
All destined for you.

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:37.870
He used everybody around him
as pawns right until the end.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.872
Everyone was handed
something they had

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:41.457
to mail off on a specific day
to someone

01:22:41.499 --> 01:22:44.502
who'd send it to somebody else,
who'd finally send it to you.

01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:47.588
But nobody ever knew
what those missives contain.

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.091
Even the emails were encrypted.

01:22:50.132 --> 01:22:52.218
A perfect plot.

01:22:52.259 --> 01:22:55.638
And when I broke the spider's web,
what happened?

01:22:56.514 --> 01:22:59.100
Everyone received
a telegram from ed

01:22:59.141 --> 01:23:03.604
in which he bugged his accomplices
to send everything back to his lawyer.

01:23:03.646 --> 01:23:06.023
Did you receive one, too?

01:23:06.857 --> 01:23:08.651
No.

01:23:08.776 --> 01:23:13.239
I was the only one who didn't agree
to play his game.

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:15.908
He took it badly,

01:23:15.992 --> 01:23:18.411
but I left him in no doubt
that he couldn't count on me.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:23.666
He knew I didn't agree with the way
he was treating his family.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:26.419
Well, I hope that it didn't
compromise your friendship.

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:29.547
I'm a doctor.
I see everything close up.

01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:32.550
If things go wrong
I fix them or at least

01:23:32.675 --> 01:23:36.178
I try to, to make sure
people don't suffer.

01:23:36.262 --> 01:23:40.141
Ed was a friend, but it didn't
stop me accusing him.

01:23:40.307 --> 01:23:42.059
He was self-centred.

01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:45.438
He succeeded in making everybody
unhappy his wife, his children

01:23:45.563 --> 01:23:48.524
and in the end, I imagine,
even you, Amy.

01:23:49.692 --> 01:23:52.194
You were right to put a stop to it all.

01:23:52.278 --> 01:23:54.321
This plan of Ed's was insane.

01:23:54.447 --> 01:23:58.409
Good only for a splash on the cover
of a second-rate sci fi novel.

01:23:58.451 --> 01:24:00.411
What'll happen to all that mail?

01:24:02.079 --> 01:24:04.832
It'll probably end up
alongside those wills

01:24:04.957 --> 01:24:07.084
whose existence nobody
knows about.

01:24:07.209 --> 01:24:09.920
But I've got to have those messages.

01:24:09.962 --> 01:24:13.549
Please, help me
to convince Mr Durrell.

01:24:13.591 --> 01:24:16.927
I know him well.
He's completely unbending.

01:24:17.845 --> 01:24:22.600
He'd hand everything over to you only
if he received a request from ed.

01:24:25.478 --> 01:24:27.438
Somebody cancelled
everything to make room.

01:24:28.939 --> 01:24:31.484
I know you can work miracles
with these gadgets.

01:24:32.943 --> 01:24:34.987
Help me.

01:24:36.238 --> 01:24:38.491
There's one thing I could try.

01:24:38.616 --> 01:24:40.242
But you'd have to leave me
the camcorder.

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:43.954
- And authorize me to get others involved.
- Who do you mean?

01:24:45.247 --> 01:24:46.874
The intelligence service.

01:24:46.999 --> 01:24:50.002
I've got a friend
there but you can't be present.

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:51.962
And if we find something,

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:54.757
inevitably we'll all see it.

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:56.759
What are you looking for in here?

01:24:58.385 --> 01:25:02.139
I can't believe you'd give in to
one of my tantrums.

01:25:02.223 --> 01:25:04.266
I just can't believe it.

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:11.148
If you even gave me the possibility
of breaking off with you, after you.

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.030
And if you know me,

01:25:18.114 --> 01:25:20.658
you must allow me
the right to reconsider.

01:25:21.867 --> 01:25:23.661
You must have dreamed up
some system

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.663
for letting me get back
in touch with you.

01:25:26.914 --> 01:25:30.126
Eleven times ed, eleven times Amy,
eleven times you and me,

01:25:30.167 --> 01:25:32.545
eleven times me and you.
Upper case, lower case.

01:25:32.670 --> 01:25:35.422
I've tried every combination.

01:25:35.506 --> 01:25:37.675
But it's no good.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:43.931
You can't leave me
in a maze with no exit.

01:25:45.015 --> 01:25:47.810
That's how I'd go off the road,
my love.

01:25:53.274 --> 01:25:55.067
Understand?

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:57.444
We'll shoot the explosion separately.

01:26:01.073 --> 01:26:03.075
There's no way
I'm ever doing that scene!

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:06.328
But the director wants you.
He'll put three cameras on the car.

01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:08.581
You're in shot, and he's calling you
in other scenes.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:10.833
- Don't go on.
- It's a great chance.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.085
- You'd make a fortune!
- I don't care!

01:26:13.169 --> 01:26:15.462
What's got into her?

01:26:16.338 --> 01:26:19.091
I don't recognise her anymore.
Try talking to her, Jason.

01:26:22.595 --> 01:26:25.848
Don't do it, Amy,
n00ne's forcing you.

01:26:25.931 --> 01:26:27.933
UT don't take it so badly.

01:26:27.975 --> 01:26:31.228
He's only so insistent because
he doesn't know anything.

01:26:31.312 --> 01:26:33.981
- Maybe I understand though.
- You've changed profession.

01:26:34.064 --> 01:26:35.941
You're a mind reader now?

01:26:37.318 --> 01:26:40.487
There are some traces of recordings
done on memory cards,

01:26:40.613 --> 01:26:43.365
but it's impossible to recover them
without the cards themselves.

01:26:43.490 --> 01:26:46.619
Apart from that, the hard disc is blank.

01:26:46.702 --> 01:26:48.579
Sorry.

01:26:49.580 --> 01:26:51.498
- Thanks for trying.
- No problem.

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:54.877
You can always count
on me. I'll talk to him.

01:27:45.052 --> 01:27:47.304
What are you looking for, Amy?

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:50.933
Apart from the envelope
you gave me last time,

01:27:51.058 --> 01:27:53.185
did the professor give you
anything else?

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:58.524
Yes. A big envelope addressed
to a foreign lawyer, in Edinburgh.

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:01.068
It was stamped.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:03.977
But open inside there were
some smaller envelopes.

01:28:04.002 --> 01:28:04.905
Envelopes?

01:28:04.947 --> 01:28:07.783
Letters for you. Numbered.

01:28:07.825 --> 01:28:10.953
I was supposed to let you find them
in the house one at a time,

01:28:11.078 --> 01:28:14.790
when I saw you coming to the village.
- Where are they?

01:28:14.832 --> 01:28:16.959
The professor told me:

01:28:17.084 --> 01:28:20.296
"I hope not, but maybe one Clay
I'll send you a telegram

01:28:20.337 --> 01:28:22.923
with further instructions".

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:32.808
Dear Angela, please seal
the big envelope I left with you

01:28:32.850 --> 01:28:34.351
and send it to the address given.

01:28:34.476 --> 01:28:37.313
Thank you for everything.
Always. Ed Phoerum.

01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:41.358
It arrived the day after you left,
the last time.

01:29:07.718 --> 01:29:10.262
See how beautiful it is.

01:29:12.139 --> 01:29:14.892
It's yours.
The professor liked these.

01:29:22.733 --> 01:29:24.902
He used to study them.

01:29:24.985 --> 01:29:26.904
Study and study.

01:29:27.738 --> 01:29:30.115
Study and study.

01:29:30.908 --> 01:29:35.287
- Study and study and study.
- Ottavio!

01:29:37.664 --> 01:29:39.625
Did he leave you anything?

01:29:40.626 --> 01:29:42.419
No.

01:29:42.503 --> 01:29:45.005
But when he left,

01:29:45.923 --> 01:29:48.801
this fell on the shore.

01:29:51.678 --> 01:29:54.014
I've dried it in the sun.

01:29:54.765 --> 01:30:00.813
It's not in good shape
but I've kept it for him.

01:30:00.938 --> 01:30:02.940
Ottavio.

01:30:03.065 --> 01:30:05.943
- The professore is...
- When he comes back,

01:30:07.444 --> 01:30:09.571
he will get it.

01:30:30.217 --> 01:30:32.344
Wonderful, wonderful years,

01:30:32.428 --> 01:30:34.805
the six most beautiful years of my life.

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:37.057
So thank you, my darling!

01:30:42.479 --> 01:30:44.857
Hi, Amy. I do this later.

01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.608
<i>Hi.</i>

01:30:55.200 --> 01:30:56.869
Sorry.

01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:58.954
I hope you're...

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:04.126
Hello, Amy.

01:31:06.128 --> 01:31:08.130
Hello, Amy!

01:31:20.267 --> 01:31:22.519
Hello Amy, how are you?

01:31:22.644 --> 01:31:24.980
Hello Amy, how are you?

01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:33.614
How are you?

01:31:40.537 --> 01:31:44.041
- If you want I'll stop the whole thing.
- No, it's Ok.

01:31:45.792 --> 01:31:47.544
How are you?

01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:50.797
How are you?

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:56.053
Not such a good day here, today.

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:58.555
I hope the weather's better
where you are.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:03.810
I trust, let's say, you are
in a good place to listen to me.

01:32:03.894 --> 01:32:06.522
Surprise visits
can be disastrous, I know,

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.441
but the guest always hopes
for a welcome.

01:32:10.776 --> 01:32:12.694
<i>Yes...</i>

01:32:12.778 --> 01:32:15.656
Who knows what
you're doing right now.

01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:21.578
<i>Who...</i>

01:32:23.205 --> 01:32:26.041
<i>Who knows...</i>

01:32:27.292 --> 01:32:31.463
Who knows if I've managed
to make you happy.

01:32:33.840 --> 01:32:37.427
I can't say these things to her.
No I can't, I can't, I can't.

01:33:40.907 --> 01:33:43.285
As usual, you're right.

01:33:43.410 --> 01:33:45.787
If it wasn't for you

01:33:45.912 --> 01:33:48.790
I might never have gone to see her.

01:33:48.874 --> 01:33:51.877
She was happy. So was I.

01:33:51.918 --> 01:33:54.254
I stayed three days.

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:57.549
We had a lot of catching up to do.

01:33:59.176 --> 01:34:01.553
It all felt right.

01:34:03.430 --> 01:34:05.182
Thank you for insisting.

01:34:06.183 --> 01:34:08.185
We've been able
to talk about you and me,

01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:11.938
with nothing off limits,
did me a lot of good.

01:34:12.022 --> 01:34:14.316
I felt lighter when I left.

01:34:19.821 --> 01:34:22.157
Good night, my love.

01:34:22.199 --> 01:34:24.076
Talk soon.

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:57.192
Now!

01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:15.210
Cut! Give me a playback!

01:35:19.881 --> 01:35:22.467
Rick! Rick!

01:35:24.511 --> 01:35:26.513
- Rick! Come on! Wake up!
- Relax!

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:28.515
I'm alive!

01:35:32.144 --> 01:35:35.147
- Excellent!
- Both of you!

01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:43.029
- You were great.
- Thanks.

01:35:56.168 --> 01:35:59.796
- There were at least eight of them.
- We are going to call the police.

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:03.300
Did they break into yours as well?

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:08.680
There was only one, the lady
on the third floor says.

01:36:08.764 --> 01:36:11.433
Impossible. It was a professional job.
They work in packs.

01:36:11.558 --> 01:36:15.520
- What happens...
- I don't know what's happening.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:40.462
- Call the police!
- Someone call the police!

01:36:44.591 --> 01:36:46.593
My apartment as well.

01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:51.681
Cleaned out six apartments
but nobody saw them leave.

01:37:14.246 --> 01:37:16.498
At the space-time dimensions

01:37:16.623 --> 01:37:18.834
on the basis of which we should
all have ten doubles

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:21.127
dispersed in the infinity
of multiverses.

01:37:21.253 --> 01:37:25.632
- So there are eleven of us?
- Eleven eds and eleven Amys.

01:37:26.842 --> 01:37:29.719
Why didn't I cross
with that right away?

01:37:34.474 --> 01:37:37.269
One, two, three, four,

01:37:37.394 --> 01:37:39.896
five, six, seven,

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:43.859
eight, nine, and ten.

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:01.561
Hi, kamikaze.

01:39:01.603 --> 01:39:04.731
It's been too long
since we spoke

01:39:04.814 --> 01:39:07.317
but I'm glad we decided
to make it up.

01:39:07.359 --> 01:39:12.113
I hereby swear never to bore you
with my sermons ever again,

01:39:12.197 --> 01:39:17.744
although I hope the last one
was some help.

01:39:18.244 --> 01:39:22.123
If not, no matter.

01:39:22.248 --> 01:39:27.379
But you'd better know that I'm not
gonna give up my job without a fight

01:39:27.504 --> 01:39:31.007
as your tutor,

01:39:31.091 --> 01:39:33.969
because I'm pretty good at that

01:39:34.511 --> 01:39:39.015
and I suspect that you might have fallen
behind in that department.

01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:40.642
Have you?

01:39:41.351 --> 01:39:42.852
Ok, you're right.

01:39:42.894 --> 01:39:47.107
Not now. We'll talk
about it another time.

01:39:47.899 --> 01:39:49.776
You just tell me when.

01:39:49.859 --> 01:39:52.153
I'm not completely deaf, you know.

01:39:52.278 --> 01:39:55.156
I can still hear you clear as a bell.

01:39:57.742 --> 01:39:59.661
I miss you.

01:40:01.871 --> 01:40:03.790
I miss you, too.

01:40:04.290 --> 01:40:06.376
But a bit less now,

01:40:06.418 --> 01:40:09.879
partly because I've decided
to answer all your messages.

01:40:09.921 --> 01:40:13.174
Take it easy, I'll try not
to go on too much.

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:17.137
Besides, you know,

01:40:18.638 --> 01:40:23.184
I'm confident that one way or another,
you'll receive my correspondence.

01:40:23.309 --> 01:40:26.438
Amy! It's ready!

01:40:26.521 --> 01:40:28.064
Coming!

01:40:29.065 --> 01:40:32.777
Well, as you heard, lunch is ready.
I have to go. But let me tell you

01:40:32.819 --> 01:40:36.197
I've given up being a kamikaze.
Happy?

01:40:37.198 --> 01:40:38.908
See you later.

01:40:47.167 --> 01:40:50.837
I made a promise: That at the beginning
of your third lunch here

01:40:50.920 --> 01:40:53.548
I'd give you this.

01:41:07.979 --> 01:41:11.107
Did I ever talk to you about
the St. just library?

01:41:11.191 --> 01:41:12.942
I'd check it out, if I were you.

01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:16.321
I made an appointment for you
for the last Monday in may.

01:41:16.362 --> 01:41:19.365
Try to make it if you can.
All my love. Your ed.

01:41:25.622 --> 01:41:28.625
These are the volumes
requested by professor Phoerum.

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:30.585
Oh. Thank you.

01:41:30.627 --> 01:41:33.880
You'll find the chapters suggested
by the professor marked.

01:41:33.963 --> 01:41:37.133
Do be careful, these are rare texts
and very delicate.

01:41:37.217 --> 01:41:39.219
I'll do my best.

01:42:06.913 --> 01:42:08.498
Hello Amy.

01:42:08.540 --> 01:42:11.793
I know, I never call
a pretty girl at dinner,

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.920
you never know what risk
you are running

01:42:14.045 --> 01:42:16.422
but I had a terrible dream last night.

01:42:16.506 --> 01:42:21.177
You were being courted
by some young men.

01:42:21.261 --> 01:42:25.265
At first you shut them off
and then little by little

01:42:25.306 --> 01:42:29.060
you warmed to one of them
who bore little resemblance to me

01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:31.437
and I realised that,

01:42:32.689 --> 01:42:36.151
this is inevitably
how things will end up,

01:42:36.192 --> 01:42:38.945
it's only natural if I wasn't there.

01:42:40.446 --> 01:42:42.699
So, this is why I'm ringing you:

01:42:44.284 --> 01:42:49.455
To spoil the dinner you're having
with whoever you are flirting with.

01:42:51.916 --> 01:42:55.086
Your jealous little scene
really upset me.

01:42:55.170 --> 01:42:58.548
I'm disappointed
at your bad timing.

01:42:58.590 --> 01:43:02.594
For the first time you seemed
to me out of order.

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:08.558
I feel like such an idiot
talking to you

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.852
knowing that you can't hear me.

01:43:26.951 --> 01:43:28.578
You're incredible.

01:43:30.830 --> 01:43:33.708
I wonder if I really deserve all this.

01:43:33.750 --> 01:43:35.835
It'd have been better that

01:43:35.877 --> 01:43:39.631
during those three months
you'd focused more on yourself

01:43:39.756 --> 01:43:41.758
and your family.

01:43:47.222 --> 01:43:50.725
Oh, and I forgot to tell you
that I'm getting on with my thesis,

01:43:50.767 --> 01:43:53.353
but I doubt if I'll ever finish it.

01:43:55.021 --> 01:43:58.524
I'm going to be an eternal
failing student.

01:44:04.030 --> 01:44:08.910
- Apart from studying, what are you up to?
- Having a great time.

01:44:09.035 --> 01:44:12.538
If that's the effect it's having, you'd
be better getting blown up with us.

01:44:12.622 --> 01:44:14.540
At least you'll have a laugh.

01:44:14.666 --> 01:44:16.876
Is it so important
if I laugh or not?

01:44:16.918 --> 01:44:19.754
Well, yeah! If you laugh,
it means you're happy.

01:44:32.308 --> 01:44:34.269
Good morning, kamikaze.

01:44:35.436 --> 01:44:40.191
You're going to find
a mountain of important books.

01:44:41.067 --> 01:44:44.070
Have fun doing whatever
research you want.

01:44:44.153 --> 01:44:49.325
Now, by my calculations you should
already be at Saint just.

01:44:49.450 --> 01:44:51.577
The monks should
have everything ready,

01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:54.664
with bookmarks
at the relevant chapters.

01:44:54.789 --> 01:44:56.958
These are the accounts...

01:44:59.043 --> 01:45:02.088
There's somebody who makes
her happy. Lucky guy.

01:45:10.096 --> 01:45:16.602
In other words, and without
any fear of being proved wrong,

01:45:16.728 --> 01:45:20.064
we could conclude that in the history
of astrophysics

01:45:20.106 --> 01:45:24.360
knowledge about the universe derives
from the study of dead stars.

01:45:25.570 --> 01:45:28.698
The catastrophic event
that marks the end of a star,

01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:32.744
whether it's the explosion
or collapse of a supernova,

01:45:32.869 --> 01:45:37.457
a hypernova
or a bynar driven supernova,

01:45:37.498 --> 01:45:40.877
enables science to understand
something, which,

01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.629
on the hypothesis of the
immortality of the stars,

01:45:43.713 --> 01:45:47.884
would remain even more inexplicable
to us than it already is.

01:45:49.886 --> 01:45:53.639
By virtue of the relationship
between the speed of light

01:45:53.723 --> 01:45:58.353
and the distance of billions
of solar systems from the earth,

01:45:58.394 --> 01:46:01.356
we continue to see dead stars

01:46:01.397 --> 01:46:04.400
even though they no longer exist.

01:46:04.525 --> 01:46:09.906
Indeed, it is precisely their disastrous
end that reveals them to us.

01:46:09.989 --> 01:46:12.784
An epiphany that can last
centuries, months

01:46:12.909 --> 01:46:15.036
or a handful of seconds.

01:46:15.119 --> 01:46:17.497
In any case it is
the revelation of a death

01:46:17.538 --> 01:46:20.416
that occurred billions of years ago.

01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:26.381
What scientists are doing is dialoguing
with that, which no longer exists.

01:46:28.508 --> 01:46:30.676
What do you make of that?

01:46:33.304 --> 01:46:35.556
Amy Ryan. Her thesis,

01:46:35.681 --> 01:46:39.394
"from guest stars to supernovas:
A dialogue with dead stars,"

01:46:39.435 --> 01:46:41.938
was highly commended
by the university board.

01:46:42.063 --> 01:46:44.899
We now confer on her a degree
in astrophysics and cosmology.

01:46:44.941 --> 01:46:47.318
First class honours with distinction.

01:46:55.451 --> 01:47:00.415
- Oh, I'm so proud, so proud of you.
- Thank you.

01:47:06.421 --> 01:47:08.214
- Congratulations.
- This is for you, Amy.

01:47:08.339 --> 01:47:10.967
Or should I say doctor Ryan?

01:47:11.092 --> 01:47:13.094
- Thank you very much.
- You are welcome.

01:47:17.348 --> 01:47:20.435
Congratulations my darling, ed.

01:47:23.604 --> 01:47:26.482
- Hi. Thank you for coming.
- Very well done.

01:47:26.566 --> 01:47:28.568
Thanks.

01:47:30.987 --> 01:47:34.365
Ah well, we could
hardly fail to be here.

01:47:36.868 --> 01:47:41.205
- Can I introduce Nicholas, my brother?
- Congratulations, Amy.

01:47:41.247 --> 01:47:42.999
Thank you.

01:47:45.001 --> 01:47:46.752
Excuse me.

01:47:51.883 --> 01:47:56.137
...but remember you still have
to earn your graduation gift.

01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:59.474
Go tomorrow to 45
Herrmann street, first floor.

01:47:59.515 --> 01:48:03.019
I'll be in touch soon, your ed.

01:48:06.522 --> 01:48:09.484
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:12.236
Professor ed Phoerum

01:48:12.278 --> 01:48:16.032
has left you sole ownership
of his property in Borgoventoso.

01:48:16.157 --> 01:48:17.314
But...

01:48:17.339 --> 01:48:20.810
Would you now be so kind to sign
for acceptance of the legacy?

01:48:20.912 --> 01:48:22.622
Here.

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:25.166
After that we can finalize the deed.

01:48:27.043 --> 01:48:29.253
Excuse me, but...

01:48:29.295 --> 01:48:33.007
- Does the Phoerum family know about this?
- Of course they do.

01:48:33.049 --> 01:48:36.177
The legacy is part of the professor's
last will and testament.

01:48:36.302 --> 01:48:38.179
Please.

01:49:45.454 --> 01:49:47.623
Hi, kamikaze.

01:49:50.001 --> 01:49:52.962
You don't know how happy
I am that you're here.

01:49:55.089 --> 01:49:57.008
Who knows why,

01:49:57.133 --> 01:50:01.095
but I don't imagine you
in the house by the fire somehow

01:50:01.220 --> 01:50:04.265
but outside, by the lake,

01:50:05.349 --> 01:50:07.518
or on the terrace.

01:50:08.894 --> 01:50:10.771
Excuse my back.

01:50:12.231 --> 01:50:14.525
I don't mean to be rude.

01:50:15.985 --> 01:50:19.864
But the more time goes by,
the more vain I seem to get.

01:50:20.906 --> 01:50:25.244
So today I decided
to show you my best side.

01:50:28.539 --> 01:50:35.046
After all, even a supernova
continues to rotate in its orbit.

01:50:38.049 --> 01:50:41.385
Although sooner or later,

01:50:42.428 --> 01:50:45.056
in centuries or in seconds,

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:47.933
a moment comes when it reverts

01:50:48.059 --> 01:50:50.561
to the nothingness
from which it was born.

01:50:52.063 --> 01:50:55.650
And there's no way I am going
to be an exception to that rule.

01:50:59.570 --> 01:51:02.073
So I fear, my darling...

01:51:02.198 --> 01:51:05.326
I won't manage to come up
with any more ideas,

01:51:05.409 --> 01:51:08.537
how to be with you.

01:51:11.582 --> 01:51:13.668
But you know,

01:51:13.709 --> 01:51:20.049
it's not fair to attribute anguish
and fear to a sense of nothingness.

01:51:21.717 --> 01:51:27.848
The human mind will never
be able to grasp infinity,

01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:32.978
not even truly understand love.

01:51:35.481 --> 01:51:38.609
So I don't want you to cry.

01:51:41.445 --> 01:51:44.073
There's a logic to everything.

01:51:45.116 --> 01:51:48.994
For all I know,
at the moment of birth,

01:51:49.078 --> 01:51:54.500
all of us possess the gift of immortality.

01:51:56.627 --> 01:52:01.132
You'll ask "then why do we die?".

01:52:01.215 --> 01:52:07.263
Because in the course
of our existence

01:52:07.388 --> 01:52:12.768
we commit one mistake,

01:52:12.852 --> 01:52:14.895
just one

01:52:16.272 --> 01:52:19.650
but that makes us lose
the gift of eternal life.

01:52:24.488 --> 01:52:26.866
I can already hear you asking:

01:52:28.617 --> 01:52:30.786
"What mistake?"

01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:36.125
It's not given to us to know

01:52:36.167 --> 01:52:38.669
but it is because of that mistake

01:52:38.753 --> 01:52:42.673
that human beings become mortal.

01:52:44.925 --> 01:52:48.387
Of course you'll probably
raise the objection

01:52:51.682 --> 01:52:55.311
that no one has ever
lived long enough

01:52:55.394 --> 01:52:59.148
to demonstrate the reliability
of that theory

01:52:59.190 --> 01:53:01.567
and that's true.

01:53:03.569 --> 01:53:08.949
But it's also true that nobody has
ever been an exception to it.

01:53:12.953 --> 01:53:16.332
Logic, logic, logic.

01:53:21.462 --> 01:53:23.798
I understood what my mistake was.

01:53:26.217 --> 01:53:28.093
Not everybody reaches that.

01:53:31.472 --> 01:53:33.224
But I did.

01:53:35.476 --> 01:53:40.815
My mistake was
not meeting you sooner.

01:53:42.107 --> 01:53:45.486
Not being able to live
with you longer.

01:53:47.488 --> 01:53:49.990
That seems to me
a good enough reason

01:53:52.117 --> 01:53:55.079
to forfeit the gift of immortality.

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.377
But thanks to you,

01:54:03.087 --> 01:54:06.507
these last three months
have been...

01:54:10.135 --> 01:54:12.346
Beautiful,

01:54:13.639 --> 01:54:17.101
beautiful, beautiful...

01:54:21.522 --> 01:54:27.611
I'm trying to think
of an original closure,

01:54:31.532 --> 01:54:33.659
but all I can come up with...

01:54:38.289 --> 01:54:40.291
Is I love you.

01:54:53.178 --> 01:54:58.434
Now, there's a curious story
connected with this work

01:54:58.934 --> 01:55:01.437
it's actually the reject.

01:55:01.562 --> 01:55:05.649
When we made it,
the model wasn't well,

01:55:05.691 --> 01:55:07.651
she moved.

01:55:07.693 --> 01:55:10.070
We repeated the cast,

01:55:10.195 --> 01:55:12.531
absolute perfection.

01:55:13.157 --> 01:55:16.201
But from that moment on
I couldn't stop wondering

01:55:16.327 --> 01:55:18.829
why the deformed version
was so expressive,

01:55:18.954 --> 01:55:23.042
while the perfect cast
said nothing to me.

01:55:24.460 --> 01:55:27.796
Who knows what happened
to that woman,

01:55:27.838 --> 01:55:33.427
but I feel what's captured here is
it's an imprint of a mysterious pain.

01:55:35.554 --> 01:55:37.473
I'd like to have talked
to her about it.

01:55:38.557 --> 01:55:43.729
I've tried to find her since, but
she seems to have vanished.

01:55:43.812 --> 01:55:46.815
- That's very interesting.
- Yes, sure.

01:55:46.857 --> 01:55:49.568
This is the first time
I see you working in white.

01:55:49.610 --> 01:55:51.362
Is this a new direction for you?

01:55:51.487 --> 01:55:53.948
I don't know what direction
my work is going to take.

01:55:56.700 --> 01:55:58.494
Amy!

01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:04.625
- Jason! What are you doing here?
- Nothing...

01:56:06.585 --> 01:56:09.088
I thought I might find you here.

01:56:09.964 --> 01:56:13.008
Haven't seen you for ages. You've
changed all your contact numbers.

01:56:13.092 --> 01:56:16.637
Uhm... yeah, yeah.

01:56:18.973 --> 01:56:20.641
You're tied up'?

01:56:20.766 --> 01:56:23.018
Do you wanna go for a drink'?

01:56:23.143 --> 01:56:25.896
Uhm... not tonight, no,

01:56:26.021 --> 01:56:29.775
but I'll call you, and that way
you'll have my new number

01:56:29.900 --> 01:56:32.027
and we'll fix something up.

01:56:32.861 --> 01:56:34.488
Promise?

01:56:38.534 --> 01:56:40.494
Promise.
