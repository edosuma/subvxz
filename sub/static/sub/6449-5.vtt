NARRATOR:
Previously on Smallville:

00:03.628 --> 00:04.788
Lois?

00:04.963 --> 00:08.000
Lois Lane? She's the one
who got this whole thing started...

00:08.174 --> 00:10.586
...ca||ing those costumed vigilantes
"heroes."

00:10.760 --> 00:13.502
I thought those Sex and the City girls
had gaudy taste.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.467
You might tell that to its owner,
the goddess queen Isis.

00:16.641 --> 00:17.676
She spent eternity...

00:17.851 --> 00:20.467
...searching for the cut-up pieces
of her dead husband.

00:20.645 --> 00:23.102
CLARK: But now that you're back,
are we, uh, partners?

00:23.273 --> 00:25.980
Of course. Unless you're disappointed
I'm not blonder.

00:26.151 --> 00:28.642
Cat. She's no Lois Lane.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.320
People have these
so-called vigilantes all wrong.

00:32.490 --> 00:34.446
I am Green Arrow.

00:34.617 --> 00:38.075
I'm sorry for everything I've done
that's destroyed your trust.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.028
You betrayed me, Tess.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.292
-What's your name?
-l'm Alexander.

00:43.460 --> 00:45.291
TESS:
It's okay. I won't hurt you.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.382
OLIVER:
I'm not really sure about the spotlight.

00:52.552 --> 00:54.133
-To me, it seems—
ADRIANNA: Necessary.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.421
I want everyone to see you the moment
you start down from the skylight.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.931
OLIVER: You want me to zip-line in?
-lt'll make the gala.

01:00.101 --> 01:01.762
We'll set you up
with a wire and harness.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.428
Imagine their faces
as you come ﬂying in.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.940
Daring. Invincible.
The fans will love you.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.566
All right. Yeah, I like it.

01:10.737 --> 01:14.321
But I'm not gonna need the wire. I'll just
go ahead and use my grappling gun.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.574
Our insurance doesn't cover that. Which
reminds me, do you have a helmet?

01:17.744 --> 01:19.075
Uh--

01:19.245 --> 01:21.577
Okay, no harness, no helmet.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.831
After our guys ﬁnish moving everything
over to the exhibit hall...

01:25.001 --> 01:29.745
...we'll set up a platform next to the
sarcophagus, which is where you'll land.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.040
And then the Green Arrow Girls
will come out—

01:33.218 --> 01:37.461
-Green Arrow Girls? Really?
-Billionaire by day, and hero by night.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.306
Oliver, you're better than Christmas.

01:41.476 --> 01:42.761
-Uh—
-Thank you.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.972
Miss Adrianna?

01:46.231 --> 01:47.516
Excuse me. Okay.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.898
Isis: A Tale of Eternal Love.

01:51.069 --> 01:52.559
That's quite a title you chose.

01:53.029 --> 01:55.361
My love life
may not be in the same shape it was...

01:55.532 --> 01:59.741
...when I started funding this project,
but, uh, I still believe in the story.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.742
And you're hoping
wherever she may be...

02:01.913 --> 02:04.370
...some feisty little blond
is gonna get the message.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.582
Excuse me.

02:07.752 --> 02:10.539
If only you still were the same guy
that Chloe fell for...

02:10.713 --> 02:12.874
...and not a caricature of him.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.923
What are you up to, Oliver?

02:16.094 --> 02:19.006
This city has embraced me.
I'm trying to give something back.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.466
Groupie love isn't real love, Oliver.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.635
You used to know that.

02:24.769 --> 02:27.886
Do you even know
what real love looks like anymore?

02:31.901 --> 02:36.645
Oliver, we have a, uh,
very serious problem.

02:36.823 --> 02:40.941
Well, the, uh, Amulet of Isis is missing.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.906
TESS:
What a shame.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.413
But what do they say, Oliver?
"The show must go on."

02:47.584 --> 02:50.576
As far as I'm concerned,
the thief will get what they deserve.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.880
According to legend,
the necklace is cursed.

02:53.047 --> 02:56.130
Whatever soul dares possess it
will be condemned...

02:56.301 --> 02:58.212
...to spend all of eternity in hell.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.057
Clark, you don't have
to hide the truth any longer.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.278
I know your secret.

03:19.699 --> 03:23.112
And I get why
you didn't tell me for so long.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.870
But the fact is,
knowing you're the Blurjust....

03:27.040 --> 03:29.782
It makes me love you even more.

03:32.128 --> 03:33.538
[SIGHS]

03:35.381 --> 03:38.464
And I sound like
a bad soap opera. Ha, ha.

03:39.135 --> 03:42.969
Ugh. You know what I need?
I need a good headline.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.881
Something snappy, something like:

03:46.643 --> 03:51.182
"Hey, Clark, you're Blur-riﬁc." Heh.

Oh, damn it. Really?

04:04.160 --> 04:08.870
"Hey, Clark, do you remember
when the Blur and I kissed?"

04:09.040 --> 04:12.407
[AS CLARK]
"How could I, Lois? I wasn't there."

04:13.044 --> 04:14.454
[IN NORMAL VOICE]
"But you were...

04:14.629 --> 04:17.496
...because I could tell it was you
from the kiss."

04:18.341 --> 04:21.378
[AS CLARK] "Does it change
the way you feel about me?"

04:22.512 --> 04:24.343
[LAUGHS IN NORMAL VOICE]

04:25.848 --> 04:27.713
When I realized that the man I loved...

04:27.892 --> 04:30.224
...and the hero I admired
were the same person...

04:30.395 --> 04:34.013
...it was like
everything just ﬁt into place.

04:35.775 --> 04:38.767
I'm gonna start
with coffee and doughnuts.

04:45.201 --> 04:49.160
Carpe diem, Lois. You can do this.

04:49.330 --> 04:53.699
And by tomorrow,
you will be living in a brand-new world.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.534

06:11.704 --> 06:13.114
What are you wearing, anyway?

06:14.999 --> 06:16.375
I'm telling Lois my secret.

06:17.418 --> 06:20.626
Okay, that's ofﬁcially the biggest news
I've heard all day.

06:20.797 --> 06:25.131
-Why now?
-I saw the future recently.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.168
Okay, that's ofﬁcially
the biggest news I've heard all day.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.008
You know you sound crazy
when you talk like that, right?

06:31.182 --> 06:33.639
In the future,
Lois already knew about me.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.971
What I didn't see
is how I told her or when.

06:36.145 --> 06:38.477
My instincts have always been
to keep my secret...

06:38.648 --> 06:41.310
...but then I see a future
that seems too good to be true--

06:41.484 --> 06:44.146
You came here hoping
I would talk you out of telling her?

06:44.320 --> 06:47.687
No. Maybe.

06:47.865 --> 06:51.528
I hate to break it to you,
but I say go for it.

06:51.702 --> 06:54.785
Coming out was the best thing
I ever did. I can ﬁnally be myself.

06:54.956 --> 06:57.698
It turns out,
people actually like the real me.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.412
That is an understatement.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.701
Look at this.

07:01.879 --> 07:04.336
"For breakfast
after a long night keeping us safe."

07:04.507 --> 07:06.372
This is the sweetest thing.

07:06.843 --> 07:08.083
Oh, and...

07:10.346 --> 07:12.257
...my new favorite cereal.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.306
And they sent spoons.

07:15.476 --> 07:19.970
If I remember correctly, you coming out
to Lois did not have a happy ending.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.189
You told Lois the truth
and she dumped you.

07:23.359 --> 07:26.977
Uh-- We broke up, all right?

07:27.196 --> 07:30.609
Look. Lois and I were never
really meant to be together.

07:31.617 --> 07:35.781
Clark, she loves you.
That makes you a lucky man.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.287
Take it from me,
living without love is not really living.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.371
It's just sort of existing.

07:46.007 --> 07:50.216
The question you have to ask yourself
is what are you willing to risk for love?

08:14.118 --> 08:17.610
-Moming, Lois.
-Clark.

-No, no.

09:04.669 --> 09:08.628
You Metropolis girls do have
your own sense of style, don't you?

09:08.798 --> 09:11.790
You should see
what's underneath the jacket.

09:13.803 --> 09:18.388
Oliver asked me to cover the gala
at the museum. It's themed.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.808
Oh, did you not get an invitation?

09:24.689 --> 09:25.974
Sucks.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.315
Won't this be the greatest,
working together again?

09:37.493 --> 09:40.360
Our names looked terriﬁc
side-by-side on that byline.

09:40.538 --> 09:43.371
I mean, it's like
we were meant to be partners, Clark.

09:43.541 --> 09:46.078
You're the Popeye to my Olive.
The Mickey to my Minnie.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.662
The sick to my stomach.

09:51.507 --> 09:54.294
A source conﬁrmed the museum
is missing a valuable artifact...

09:54.468 --> 09:56.004
...from its new exhibit.

10:00.641 --> 10:04.179
I thought we'd check LuthorCorp's dock,
where this amulet was to arrive.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.730
Hey, I've seen
this fashion faux pas before.

10:06.897 --> 10:08.353
When I was in Egypt.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.727
I appreciate the, urn, offer.
But I'm already booked.

in that Saharan sandbox by yourself.

Don't get burned.

10:49.607 --> 10:52.644
If there was ever a time
for my lucky lipstick....

11:00.117 --> 11:03.280
So much for leaving Egypt behind.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.445
Wow, you look beautiful.

11:43.661 --> 11:48.280
Did you get that necklace for the gala?
It's so, um, Egyptian.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.289
You mean the article
that Cat's working on?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.623
Where is this Cat now?

11:58.968 --> 12:01.300
Probably on her way
to the LuthorCorp loading dock.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.961
I know that it goes against
every bone in your body...

12:04.140 --> 12:05.505
...not to chase down a lead...

12:05.683 --> 12:09.517
...but there is something that's
more important that you need to know.

12:11.522 --> 12:13.683
I wanted to tell you before.
I didn't know how.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.816
I did tell you once before,
but everything got out of control.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.978
And it wasn't your fault, though.
You were perfect.

12:21.490 --> 12:22.900
I'm doing this all wrong.

12:23.492 --> 12:27.735

was of great importance to me.

12:34.503 --> 12:36.915
That is of no importance to me.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.794
"No importance" as in it doesn't change
the way you feel about me?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.796
Or "no importance" as in you...?

what happened to Lois.

-I had my lecture on love for the day.
-Fair enough.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.999
Her husband, Osiris, was killed
by his brother, Set, out of jealousy.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.922
I guess being an only child
does have some perks.

14:04.093 --> 14:08.211
Anyway, Egyptians believed that
a person's soul remained in their heart.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.467
So when Set dismembered Osiris' body
and scattered all the pieces--

14:11.642 --> 14:13.928
He wanted to make sure
his soul never found peace.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.220
Exactly, but the mighty Isis
vowed to resurrect Osiris.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.270
She recovered his body piece by piece...

14:19.441 --> 14:22.478
...but was never able to ﬁnd
the burial jar containing his heart.

14:22.653 --> 14:26.020
To make sure that she never did,
Set trapped her spirit in an amulet.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.532
Now that she's back,
she's gonna ﬁnish what she started.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.618
If we can ﬁnd that jar, then she'll ﬁnd us.

Oh, Clark. Because of his lost soul...

14:40.796 --> 14:44.789
...Osiris was doomed
to rule the underworld for all eternity.

and chicken noodle soup.

That's what my little boy wants
when he's not feeling well.

18:27.523 --> 18:30.686
I know the look of a worried mother
when I see one.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.058
This boy's not my son.

-Are you here to pitch the follow-up...

18:39.368 --> 18:42.075

18:42.538 --> 18:47.373
They're rodents and probably rabid.
Whatever. Um--

18:47.876 --> 18:51.710

is a history-making headline.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.586

And that so-called hero
is right in your bullpen.

I'll admit that our HR ofﬁce
needs a little bit of work, but—

19:02.558 --> 19:05.391
Being a reporter
is the perfect cover for the Blur.

You can be the ﬁrst on scene

blow your own horn.

It's time the world knows the truth.

19:17.406 --> 19:21.319

is nothing but a liar and a thief.

for you to one-up a fellow reporter, Cat--

19:28.917 --> 19:33.081
Oh, I'm not trying to scoop Lois.

I will expose the Blur's identity.

19:52.774 --> 19:57.143
And I will bring down this hero menace
once and for all.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.290
You're telling me Lois Lane
has turned into Isis?

20:11.501 --> 20:13.116
How the hell does that even happen?

20:13.295 --> 20:16.628
Current theory involves an amulet
that's supposed to be at the museum...

20:16.798 --> 20:19.961
-...but is apparently around Lois' throat.
-Let me get this straight.

20:20.135 --> 20:22.251
Lois gets possessed
by an Egyptian goddess...

20:22.429 --> 20:25.136
...and is ﬂying around
like Amelia Earhart minus the plane.

20:25.307 --> 20:27.468
Just another Friday night
in Metropolis.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.554

about Cat to Clark.

I'm just trying to protect Clark.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.394
CLARK:
Protect me from what?

20:36.568 --> 20:39.480
Third wheel of your bullpen bus
thinks that Lois is the Blur.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.987
Which is why I erased
all the security footage...

20:42.157 --> 20:44.614
...of Lois crumpling a metal door
with her hand...

20:44.785 --> 20:47.322
...and throwing a security guard
across a warehouse.

20:47.537 --> 20:50.153
Cat saw what she saw,
but at least she can't prove it.

20:50.332 --> 20:53.495
Thanks for the backup.
But we have another problem.

20:53.669 --> 20:56.160
Lois found Osiris' heart.
And now I can't ﬁnd her.

20:56.421 --> 20:59.163
She does have one more layover
before our nonstop to hell.

20:59.341 --> 21:03.425
-She has to reunite the heart--
-With the body to make Osiris whole.

21:05.013 --> 21:06.674
There's a sarcophagus at the exhibit.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.806
It's rumored to hold an ancient priest
of the underworld.

21:09.977 --> 21:11.842
That high priest is actually Osiris.

21:15.357 --> 21:16.597
You stole my thunder there.

21:16.775 --> 21:19.437
Every one of those crates
has the name of the museum on it.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.852
If Isis saw that,
she'll know where the artifacts are.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.814
It's a matter of time before we become
residents of the underworld.

this Egyptian genie back in her bottle.

of LuthorCorp's active excavation sites.

Unfortunately, he also deleted it.

I know the truth and I have proof.

36:46.787 --> 36:47.947
What kind of proof?

36:48.122 --> 36:50.488
Photographic.
I caught Little Miss Liar...

36:50.666 --> 36:55.626

S-E-X ritual last night.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.631
I couldn't see who else was there.

But once I print those photos,
it won't matter. I'll have my evidence.

37:01.260 --> 37:04.502
And everyone will see the Blur
for the deviant menace she is.

Oh, my God. Those were my only copies.

37:27.203 --> 37:30.821
Well, that's a rookie mistake. You need
to always back up your evidence.

Pretend all you want, Lois,
but there's just no other explanation.

37:35.503 --> 37:37.664
Actually, there is.

Lois was possessed by the spirit of Isis.

You know, I may have kept my youthful
good looks, but I wasn't born yesterday.

I'm not buying it, Clark.

The truth? Right.

About the Blur, who he is.
The big mystery.

38:31.225 --> 38:33.557
Of course,
he never told me his identity...

I don't even really know him...

we have this special bond.

But you don't know the Blur.

39:22.443 --> 39:25.150
He's probably keeping it a secret
for a reason.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.615
He's never gonna tell me, is he?

39:34.455 --> 39:37.288
Not if it means putting your life at risk.

39:39.126 --> 39:42.789
I wish he knew
that I was willing to take that risk.

39:59.313 --> 40:01.975
All my life, I've been afraid, Lois.

40:02.149 --> 40:04.310
Afraid of people
knowing the truth about me.

40:04.485 --> 40:08.478
Afraid of them rejecting me.
And even if they didn't, still losing them.

I'd regret more than anything.
