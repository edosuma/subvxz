WEBVTT

00:05.576 --> 00:08.579
( grunting )

00:10.511 --> 00:11.512
WHOA.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.013
ALL RIGHT, GUYS, GATHER UP.

00:13.013 --> 00:15.046
TODAY,
WE ARE GOING TO BE STUDYING

00:15.046 --> 00:17.588
ONE OF THE MOST TIME-HONORED
TRADITIONS IN JAPANESE CULTURE.

00:17.588 --> 00:18.589
OOH!
NUN CHUCK COMBAT?

00:18.589 --> 00:19.690
SAMURAI SWORD
FIGHTING?

00:19.690 --> 00:23.454
WRESTLING GINORMOUS
DUDES IN DIAPERS?

00:23.454 --> 00:26.427
WE WILL BE STUDYING THE GREAT
MARTIAL ART OF AIKIDO,

00:26.427 --> 00:30.361
THE KEY PRINCIPLE OF WHICH IS TO
DEFLECT YOUR AGGRESSOR'S ATTACK

00:30.361 --> 00:32.563
BY USING HIS OWN SPEED
AND STRENGTH AGAINST HIM.

00:32.563 --> 00:35.706
CAN WE JUST GET
TO THE PART WHERE
I OBLITERATE THEM?

00:35.706 --> 00:40.211
( ringtone )

00:40.211 --> 00:42.473
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
UH, IT'S ABOUT MONEY.

00:42.473 --> 00:44.345
WHICH IS NOT
MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU,

00:44.345 --> 00:46.647
BUT IS A VERY CLOSE SECOND.

00:49.320 --> 00:51.452
HEY, ADAM,
ATTACK ME.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.554
OKAY. YOUR
HAIR IS STUPID,
YOU'RE SHORT,

00:53.554 --> 00:55.186
YOUR FACE IS WEIRD,
YOU'RE WEIRD.

00:55.186 --> 00:56.787
I MEANT HIT ME.

00:56.787 --> 00:59.730
OKAY, GOOD, BECAUSE THAT WAS
GOING TO BE A REALLY LONG LIST.

00:59.730 --> 01:01.632
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THIS?

01:01.632 --> 01:04.535
ADAM IS TEN TIMES
STRONGER THAN YOU.

01:04.535 --> 01:05.736
DOESN'T MATTER.

01:05.736 --> 01:08.739
WITH AIKIDO, A WEAK OPPONENT
CAN DEFEAT A MUCH STRONGER ONE.

01:08.739 --> 01:10.841
AH, BUT WHAT IF
THE WEAKER OPPONENT

01:10.841 --> 01:14.074
FITS NEATLY INTO
AN OVERHEAD STORAGE BIN?

01:15.346 --> 01:17.208
I'M TALKING ABOUT YOU.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.680
JUST HIT ME.

01:21.552 --> 01:23.214
WHOA!

01:23.214 --> 01:24.755
( groans )

01:26.557 --> 01:29.760
AND THAT'S ALL YOU NEED
TO KNOW ABOUT AIKIDO.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.164
OH, I GET IT.

01:33.164 --> 01:34.525
( grunts )

01:34.525 --> 01:35.626
( groans )

01:35.626 --> 01:38.769
BREE, THAT'S NOT AIKIDO!

01:38.769 --> 01:41.202
OH, REALLY?
MY BAD.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.673
( both grunting )

01:42.673 --> 01:43.604
( singsongy )
OH!

01:46.337 --> 01:47.738
CHASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.243
THE ANNUAL MISSION CREEK ROBOT
THROWDOWN IS COMING UP.

01:52.243 --> 01:55.146
LEO, FOR THE LAST TIME.
I'M NOT A ROBOT.

01:55.146 --> 01:56.347
I'M A MAN.

01:57.488 --> 02:00.321
ONE DAY, I'LL BE A MAN.

02:00.321 --> 02:02.653
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT YOU.

02:02.653 --> 02:06.126
IT'S A COMPETITION WHERE
REMOTE CONTROL ROBOTS
FIGHT TO THE DEATH.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.428
HERE, TAKE A LOOK.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.804
LEO, THAT'S COOL AND ALL,

02:13.804 --> 02:15.566
BUT I'VE GOT WAY BETTER
THINGS TO DO THAN--

02:15.566 --> 02:17.338
THE GRAND PRIZE IS $500.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.709
AND I'M IN.

02:19.740 --> 02:21.872
YEAH!

02:21.872 --> 02:23.174
WHO'S THAT GUY?

02:23.174 --> 02:24.575
KEVIN STONE.

02:24.575 --> 02:26.817
THAT SMUG JERK
WINS EVERY YEAR.

02:26.817 --> 02:28.849
HE THINKS HE'S SO
MUCH BETTER THAN ME.

02:28.849 --> 02:30.821
SOUNDS LIKE HE IS
 BETTER THAN YOU.

02:30.821 --> 02:34.825
THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

02:34.825 --> 02:36.387
SO I WAS THINKING...

02:36.387 --> 02:37.758
THAT IF THE TWO
OF US TEAMED UP

02:37.758 --> 02:40.791
AND BUILT A ROBOT TOGETHER
WE COULD TAKE KEVIN DOWN.

02:40.791 --> 02:43.664
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
WE'LL MAKE A PERFECT TEAM.

02:43.664 --> 02:46.267
I'M AN AMAZING ENGINEER,
A BRILLIANT DESIGNER,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.339
AND THE MOST INTELLIGENT
PERSON ON THE PLANET.

02:48.339 --> 02:49.340
AND YOU...

02:50.641 --> 02:52.203
ARE THE GUY WHO PICKED ME.

02:54.345 --> 02:57.548
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

02:57.548 --> 03:01.512
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

03:01.512 --> 03:04.255
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

03:04.255 --> 03:06.217
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

03:44.755 --> 03:45.856
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

03:45.856 --> 03:47.458
THIS IS AWESOME!

03:47.458 --> 03:50.701
NOW ALL IT NEEDS ARE LASER
CANNONS, FLAMETHROWERS,

03:50.701 --> 03:53.464
AND SATELLITE RADIO SO
WE CAN PUMP UP THE JAMS.

03:55.866 --> 03:58.669
LEO, THIS IS WHY YOU
ALWAYS LOSE TO KEVIN.

03:58.669 --> 04:02.973
YOU RELY ON FLASH WHEN
YOU SHOULD FOCUS MORE
ON SPEED AND STABILITY.

04:02.973 --> 04:04.445
GOTCHA.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.478
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT
THE FLAMETHROWERS?

04:07.478 --> 04:10.381
OOH, ARE YOU GUYS WORKING
ON A COMBAT ROBOT?

04:10.381 --> 04:11.582
( squeals )
 YEP.

04:11.582 --> 04:16.327
WE'RE GETTING READY FOR
THE BIG ROBOT THROWDOWN !

04:16.327 --> 04:17.558
MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK?

04:17.558 --> 04:18.559
SURE.
 ALL RIGHT.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.962
ALL RIGHT,
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.264
YEAH, LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE
ON TO SOMETHING HERE.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.497
CAN I MAKE ONE
SUGGESTION THOUGH?

04:27.338 --> 04:28.799
LET ME JOIN YOUR TEAM.

04:28.799 --> 04:30.801
I HAVE MADE A FORTUNE
DESIGNING STUFF LIKE THIS.

04:30.801 --> 04:34.044
AND IF I AM ON YOUR TEAM,
YOU ARE GUARANTEED TO WIN.

04:34.044 --> 04:35.406
FINE WITH ME.

04:35.406 --> 04:36.477
WHY NOT?

04:36.477 --> 04:38.879
YES!
I LOVE ROBOT COMPETITIONS.

04:38.879 --> 04:40.881
THEY REALLY BRING OUT
MY INNER GEEK.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.853
WOW, SO THERE'S
AN INNER ONE, TOO?

04:46.887 --> 04:48.959
CAITLIN,
THIS IS SO BORING.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.361
WOULDN'T YOU RATHER
GO TO A MOVIE?

04:50.361 --> 04:51.722
NO.

04:51.722 --> 04:52.993
YOGURT SHOP?

04:52.993 --> 04:54.425
NO.

04:54.425 --> 04:57.528
BUY MATCHING PINK CARS
AND RACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY?

04:57.528 --> 04:59.470
NO.

04:59.470 --> 05:01.602
OKAY, CAITLIN, WHAT
IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

05:01.602 --> 05:03.834
ALL YOU EVER WANT TO DO IS
HANG OUT IN MY LIVING ROOM.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.506
I GUESS I SHOULD TELL YOU.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.578
THE REASON I ALWAYS WANT
TO HANG AT YOUR HOUSE

05:07.578 --> 05:11.081
IS BECAUSE I KIND OF
HAVE A CRUSH ON ADAM.

05:11.081 --> 05:12.713
ADAM WHO?

05:13.914 --> 05:16.447
WAIT, WAIT,
MY BROTHER ADAM?

05:16.447 --> 05:18.589
EW, CAITLIN, NO.

05:18.589 --> 05:20.320
WHY NOT?

05:20.320 --> 05:22.393
COMPARED TO MY LAST
TWO BOYFRIENDS,
HE'S AN UPGRADE.

05:22.393 --> 05:24.094
FOR STARTERS,
HE'S REAL.

05:24.094 --> 05:27.798
OKAY, FIRST OFF,
ADAM'S NOT HERE.

05:27.798 --> 05:30.100
AND SECOND, THIS WHOLE THING
IS WEIRDING ME OUT.

05:30.100 --> 05:31.832
LET'S JUST GO TO THE MALL.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.063
WILL ADAM BE THERE?

05:34.104 --> 05:35.636
I'M JOKING.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.338
SORT OF.
I'M NOT.

05:38.338 --> 05:41.642
JUST WAIT RIGHT HERE,
I'M GONNA GET MY NEW JACKET.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.713
BACK IN A SEC.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.649
OH.
CAITLIN.

05:48.649 --> 05:52.082
YOU'RE HERE.
AGAIN.

05:55.486 --> 05:57.357
UH, BREE.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.489
DID I JUST--

05:58.489 --> 06:00.431
YEP, YOU DID.

06:00.431 --> 06:02.493
I GOTTA GO.

06:02.493 --> 06:04.465
BUT-- NO,
WAIT, CAITLIN!

06:04.465 --> 06:06.096
NO, C--

06:06.096 --> 06:07.898
OH!

06:09.600 --> 06:12.443
I CANNOT BELIEVE I JUST USED MY
SUPER-SPEED IN FRONT OF CAITLIN!

06:12.443 --> 06:14.575
I TOTALLY BLEW
OUR BIONIC SECRET!

06:14.575 --> 06:15.946
OH, GREAT.

06:15.946 --> 06:17.548
NOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO MOVE
FAR AWAY AND CHANGE OUR NAMES.

06:17.548 --> 06:19.580
QUICK, WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF "ADAM DAVENPORT?"

06:19.580 --> 06:22.413
THAT'S YOUR NAME.

06:22.413 --> 06:23.514
I KNOW, I MEANT FOR CHASE.

06:23.514 --> 06:24.515
I'M GONNA BE STEVE GREENBERG.

06:27.818 --> 06:29.690
HEY!
 WHA--

06:29.690 --> 06:33.393
YOU COMPLETELY
DESTROYED OUR ROBOT!

06:33.393 --> 06:35.466
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

06:35.466 --> 06:37.468
NOW IT'S TRUE.

06:37.468 --> 06:38.629
( laughing )

06:38.629 --> 06:39.770
( sighs )

06:39.770 --> 06:40.871
I'M STRIPPING IT FOR PARTS

06:40.871 --> 06:42.603
BECAUSE THERE WERE
SOME MAJOR DESIGN FLAWS.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.934
LIKE WHAT?

06:43.934 --> 06:47.578
WELL, FOR STARTERS IT SMASHES
WAY TOO EASILY. WATCH.

06:48.609 --> 06:49.710
SEE?

06:51.041 --> 06:52.713
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO THAT!

06:52.713 --> 06:56.186
GUYS, I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP
YOU BUILD A BETTER ROBOT.

06:56.186 --> 06:58.449
I MEAN, AFTER ALL,
I AM A SCIENTIFIC GENIUS.

06:58.449 --> 07:00.020
I'M A LEGENDARY THINKER.

07:00.020 --> 07:02.453
I'M A MAN WITH HAIR
THAT JUST WON'T QUIT.

07:04.625 --> 07:06.597
WE DON'T WANT YOU
HIJACKING OUR TEAM.

07:06.597 --> 07:09.500
LOOK, GUYS,
YOU KNOW HOW I WORK.

07:09.500 --> 07:11.532
I DON'T LIKE
SHARING THE SPOTLIGHT.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.033
I DON'T LIKE
LISTENING TO OTHERS.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.835
I'M A MAVERICK!

07:14.835 --> 07:16.667
WE'VE NOTICED.

07:16.667 --> 07:19.610
THAT'S WHY WE'RE KICKING YOU
OFF OUR TEAM, MAVERICK.

07:21.512 --> 07:23.043
WHAT?
YOU, YOU'RE SERIOUS?

07:25.015 --> 07:26.477
( sighs )

07:26.477 --> 07:27.748
OKAY.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.820
FINE.

07:29.820 --> 07:35.826
STOP! NO! NO!

07:39.059 --> 07:40.491
OH!

07:40.491 --> 07:42.693
I LOVE RECYCLING DRIVES!

07:42.693 --> 07:44.965
LOTS OF BARRELS,
A GIGANTIC TIRE.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.638
BREE, ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING?

07:47.638 --> 07:49.570
PROBABLY NOT.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.202
DUH!
GIGANTIC TIRE BOWLING!

07:54.605 --> 07:57.207
ADAM! THAT IS NOT
WHY WE'RE HERE.

07:57.207 --> 07:58.749
IT'S WHY I'M HERE.

08:00.210 --> 08:02.583
JUST PUSH ME.
AND I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

08:02.583 --> 08:05.485
BUT THIS IS GONNA
WORK WAY BETTER THAN
TRASH BAG SKYDIVING!

08:05.485 --> 08:07.588
NO. ADAM. STOP.

08:07.588 --> 08:10.661
WE HAVE TO FIND
CAITLIN AND STOP HER
BEFORE SHE TELLS ANYONE.

08:10.661 --> 08:13.864
OKAY, ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE
SHE SAW YOU SUPER-SPEED?

08:13.864 --> 08:16.727
WELL, SHE WON'T RETURN
MY TEXTS OR CALLS.

08:16.727 --> 08:18.729
AND WHY ELSE WOULD SHE
HAVE RUN OFF LIKE THAT?

08:18.729 --> 08:19.830
MAYBE SHE SAW A SQUIRREL.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.201
ALWAYS GETS ME RUNNING.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.677
HI, CAITLIN.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.580
WHAT'S GOING ON?

08:29.580 --> 08:31.612
OH, UH, NOTHING.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.712
NOTHING AT ALL.

08:32.712 --> 08:35.515
I, UH, I--I-- BOTTLES!

08:38.688 --> 08:40.049
( sighs )
SEE?

08:40.049 --> 08:41.621
SHE DEFINITELY KNOWS!

08:41.621 --> 08:43.953
WE CAN'T LET HER
EXPOSE OUR SECRET.

08:43.953 --> 08:48.098
BUT MAYBE WE CAN GIVE
HER SOMETHING SHE WANTS

08:48.098 --> 08:49.600
IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER SILENCE.

08:49.600 --> 08:50.661
( gasps )

08:50.661 --> 08:54.234
A HAMSTER AND
A STRAWBERRY PIE.

08:54.234 --> 08:58.238
OR...
THERE'S A GUY SHE LIKES.

08:58.238 --> 09:01.642
AH, I SEE WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THIS.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.744
MAYBE WE CAN GET HIM
TO HANG OUT WITH HER

09:03.744 --> 09:06.617
AND THEN CONVINCE HER
SHE DIDN'T SEE WHAT
SHE THINKS SHE SAW.

09:06.617 --> 09:07.918
WAIT, SEE, SAW,
CARRY THE ONE.

09:07.918 --> 09:09.219
YEAH, THAT TRACKS.

09:09.219 --> 09:12.082
SO, WHO'S THE UNLUCKY GUY?

09:12.082 --> 09:14.054
YOU.
 HUH.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.956
YU, THE JAPANESE
EXCHANGE STUDENT?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.828
NICE GUY, I CAN SEE
THAT WORKING OUT.

09:17.828 --> 09:22.132
NO, ADAM,
SHE LIKES YOU.

09:22.132 --> 09:24.034
OH, NO WAY,
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

09:24.034 --> 09:25.696
CAITLIN'S SUPER WEIRD.

09:25.696 --> 09:28.298
PLUS I'M NOT GETTING BETWEEN
HER AND THAT JAPANESE DUDE.

09:28.298 --> 09:31.972
I'LL PUSH YOU FOR TEN FRAMES
OF GIGANTIC TIRE BOWLING.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.074
YOU'VE GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.175
CLEAR OUT PEOPLE!

09:35.175 --> 09:36.807
SHE'S BOWLING,
I'M ROLLING.

09:39.109 --> 09:40.611
WELL, I'D SAY
PUT ON A HELMET,

09:40.611 --> 09:42.352
BUT AT THIS POINT
I DON'T THINK IT MATTERS.

09:42.352 --> 09:45.355
LET'S DO THIS.
( pants )

09:45.355 --> 09:48.689
WHOA!

09:53.794 --> 09:55.666
REALLY, BREE?
A SEVEN-TEN SPLIT?

09:55.666 --> 09:57.898
ROLL ME BACK,
LET'S PICK UP THE SPARE.

10:02.032 --> 10:04.775
NEXT UP, THE COMPETITOR
WHO'S TAKEN HOME

10:04.775 --> 10:07.838
THE ROBOT THROWDOWN TROPHY
FIVE YEARS RUNNING.

10:07.838 --> 10:12.713
KEVIN STONE, AND HIS ROBOT,
THE MERCHANT OF MENACE!

10:12.713 --> 10:13.814
( cheering )

10:13.814 --> 10:14.845
YEAH!

10:17.287 --> 10:20.620
AND FINALLY, COMPETING
TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME,

10:20.620 --> 10:25.055
LEO DOOLEY, CHASE DAVENPORT,
AND THEIR ROBOT, JOSH.

10:25.055 --> 10:27.998
( cheering stops, murmuring )

10:27.998 --> 10:29.730
JOSH?

10:29.730 --> 10:32.062
I DIDN'T KNOW THE NAME
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY.

10:32.062 --> 10:34.765
THE NAME IS
SUPPOSED TO BE SCARY.

10:34.765 --> 10:36.867
OKAY, LET'S GET STARTED--

10:40.871 --> 10:42.713
HOLD ON.

A GOOD SPORTSMAN,

16:27.057 --> 16:29.259
I'LL WAIT UNTIL
AFTER YOU LEAVE THE ARENA

16:29.259 --> 16:31.061

GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.308

17:18.308 --> 17:19.409
I HOPE YOU LIKE
DOCUMENTARIES

17:22.472 --> 17:25.415
LOOK, CAITLIN,
I WANTED TO ASK YOU--

17:25.415 --> 17:29.279
YES, THE ANSWER IS YES!

17:29.279 --> 17:33.123
LOOK, I NEED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT WHY YOU
RAN OUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

17:33.123 --> 17:35.385
I THINK THERE WAS
A MISUNDERSTANDING
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW.

17:35.385 --> 17:37.127
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:37.127 --> 17:38.488
I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

17:38.488 --> 17:41.461
I'M LIKE, TOTALLY BLIND
WITHOUT MY GLASSES.

17:41.461 --> 17:43.763
Bree and Adam:
WHAT?

17:43.763 --> 17:45.465
YEAH, I WASN'T WEARING THEM,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.097
BECAUSE I WAS AFRAID
IF YOU SAW ME,

17:47.097 --> 17:48.768
YOU'D THINK I WAS A DORK.

17:48.768 --> 17:49.769
( laughs nasally )

17:49.769 --> 17:53.072
SO WHY DID YOU RUN OUT?

17:53.072 --> 17:55.375
I GOT FLUSTERED WHEN
I HEARD YOUR VOICE.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.846
JUST LIKE THIS
MORNING AT SCHOOL.

17:56.846 --> 17:58.548
BUT THAT WON'T
HAPPEN ANYMORE,

17:58.548 --> 18:00.410
'CAUSE I'M TOTALLY

18:04.754 --> 18:08.488

18:30.740 --> 18:34.113
UH, I WAS SMOKING A TURKEY.

18:34.113 --> 18:37.116

18:57.767 --> 19:01.241

20:00.530 --> 20:04.574
SO YOUR PAIN

20:05.605 --> 20:06.806
LET'S DO THIS.

20:08.878 --> 20:10.240
( grunts )

20:21.321 --> 20:24.494

20:30.960 --> 20:32.902

20:44.944 --> 20:46.276
VERY IMPRESSIVE,
GUYS.

20:46.276 --> 20:47.347
HOW'D YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT?

20:47.347 --> 20:48.818
THE PRINCIPLES OF AIKIDO.

20:48.818 --> 20:51.821
WE USED YOUR OWN MOMENTUM
AND FORCE AGAINST YOU.

20:51.821 --> 20:55.585
SO THE STUDENTS
SCHOOL THE TEACHER.

20:55.585 --> 20:57.357
VERY WELL PLAYED.

20:57.357 --> 20:58.428
THANK YOU.

20:58.428 --> 21:00.430
IT TAKES A BIG MAN TO SAY THAT.

21:00.430 --> 21:03.333
BUT APPARENTLY,
A LITTLE MAN CAN TOO.

21:04.734 --> 21:06.736
YOU DO REALIZE YOU'RE
SHORTER THAN ME, RIGHT?

21:06.736 --> 21:09.369

21:15.605 --> 21:18.548
SO, I THINK I FINALLY
GOT CAITLIN OFF MY BACK.

21:18.548 --> 21:19.649
HOW'D YOU DO THAT?

21:19.649 --> 21:21.651
WITH A TRANQUILIZER GUN
AND A CROWBAR?

21:21.651 --> 21:23.012
NOPE.

21:23.012 --> 21:26.285
I JUST HELPED HER REALIZE
WHO HER REAL TRUE CRUSH IS.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.286

21:27.286 --> 21:28.388
( groans )

21:28.388 --> 21:30.289
LEAVE ME ALONE!

21:30.289 --> 21:32.322
DON'T RESIST ME,
BOOKWORM!

21:34.694 --> 21:37.767

21:37.767 --> 21:39.429
( sighs )
