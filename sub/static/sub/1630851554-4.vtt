WEBVTT

00:06.214 --> 00:08.216
[upbeat music playing]

00:15.473 --> 00:18.101
-Okay, Jacob. Go ahead.
-All right. Let's see what it is.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.103
-We're doing golf.
-[Renee] I thought--

00:20.186 --> 00:21.604
[Jacob] I suck at golf.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.691
-[Steve] Mini-golf.
-[Jacob] We all need an individual course.

00:24.774 --> 00:26.192
[Renee] Each team has a course.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.903
[Rodolfo] We need
to connect all three together.

00:28.987 --> 00:30.238
[Steve] Cake obstacle.

00:30.321 --> 00:32.699
[Cindy] Additional edible obstacle.

00:32.782 --> 00:33.950
[Jacob] Judges play course.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.577
[Brandi] Oh, jeez. Okay.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.787
Let me say,
it's nice to hear some other voices.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.165
I knew you were creative.
I've seen your work.

00:40.248 --> 00:42.167
I'm excited to work with you.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.085
I'm gonna tap right into your brain,
your brain…

00:44.169 --> 00:48.214
We just figured out what the mission is.
It is a putt-putt golf course.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.425
Now we're broken off into two teams.

00:50.508 --> 00:53.219
How can we make it a theme,
all of our ideas?

00:53.303 --> 00:57.974
-We need to "putt" them together.
-Putt them together. I like that. Not bad.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.060
There's a Yellow Course
and a Green Course.

01:00.143 --> 01:04.189
We all have to develop our own holes,
but have some continuity between us.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.107
What are you guys thinking?

01:06.983 --> 01:08.985
Hey, everybody. I am excited,

01:09.069 --> 01:12.489
because today we are gonna have a ball.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.743
Look at that.
Looks just like the real thing. Okay.

01:17.368 --> 01:19.579
Willman is lining up the putt.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.374
Oh!

01:23.458 --> 01:27.879
The bakineers are baking and building
their very own edible mini-golf holes.

01:27.962 --> 01:30.840
For the first time in this competition,
they're working in teams

01:30.924 --> 01:33.843
to create two big and delicious courses.

01:33.927 --> 01:36.429
The stakes are enormous, but the holes,

01:36.513 --> 01:38.973
well, they are miniature.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.101
Mmm.

01:47.190 --> 01:48.942
[Taylor] Does anybody, immediately,

01:49.025 --> 01:52.070
when they think putt-putt,
have some idea that comes to--

01:52.153 --> 01:53.655
-What are you thinking?
-Unicorns!

01:53.738 --> 01:56.783
-Flowers!
-Graveyards. Graveyards.

01:56.866 --> 01:58.576
-Wait, what did you say?
-Graveyards.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.496
-[Taylor] Yeah.
-Yeah!

02:01.579 --> 02:03.123
[Taylor] Heaven, hell and Hawaii.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.127
How do we connect that
with her unicorns and my Hawaii?

02:07.210 --> 02:09.337
[Renee] What if
something happened in Hawaii

02:09.420 --> 02:11.714
that died on the graveyard
and then went to heaven?

02:11.798 --> 02:14.467
-[Cindy] Are you gonna make any animals?
-I'm making a turtle.

02:14.551 --> 02:15.385
[gasps]

02:15.468 --> 02:17.971
Rest in peace, turtle!
And then we can name him.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.973
And then he somehow ends up in heaven.

02:20.056 --> 02:22.642
-He ends up in our unicorn heaven.
-[Renee] Turtle heaven!

02:22.725 --> 02:24.477
-Name your turtle.
-[Renee and Randi] Fred.

02:24.561 --> 02:25.645
-Fred.
-[Jacob] Fred.

02:25.728 --> 02:29.107
-Oh, my God! That was so weird.
-[laughing]

02:29.190 --> 02:30.024
Fred!

02:31.609 --> 02:34.028
-What are you thinking?
-It has to be contrast, right?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.322
-Dark and white balance. Yeah.
-[Joey] All right.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.783
If you're going dark,
then I'll hit 'em with colors.

02:38.867 --> 02:42.412
-Candyland or something.
-We are in Candyland. Let's go that way.

02:42.495 --> 02:44.497
-Sweet stuff. Candy.
-The life of the baker.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.042
-We could do something--
-Ice! Like purgatory on ice.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.462
-Like you're waiting on ice.
-We love the snow in Kentucky. That's big.

02:51.546 --> 02:55.133
Life, purgatory, heaven and hell.
So, we've got a cycle going, right?

02:55.216 --> 02:59.220
-Like a sweet cycle!
-That'll be our course name? Sweet Cycle?

02:59.304 --> 03:01.931
-I'll make mixes, get the cakes going.
-Stop talking, start moving!

03:02.015 --> 03:03.641
-Okay, guys. Let's go.
-Go, go, go.

03:03.725 --> 03:05.351
[all] Yeah!

03:05.435 --> 03:06.269
Let's do it, guys.

03:06.352 --> 03:07.187
[clock ticking]

03:07.270 --> 03:10.231
-[Sara] Yeah, buddy!
-Okay, I'll go get our stuff.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.525
-[Cindy] Okay!
-[Menuka] Go, Green! Go, Green!

03:13.067 --> 03:14.777
[Cindy] You know
where the cupcake pans are?

03:15.987 --> 03:16.988
Thank you.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.073
We're teammates now.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.159
-So, we can help each other.
-It's so great.

03:23.369 --> 03:24.495
Hi, judges!

03:24.579 --> 03:25.496
-Hello.
-Hi, Justin.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.124
This mission is crazy that you've created.

03:28.208 --> 03:29.250
How's it gonna work?

03:29.334 --> 03:32.170
Each of these bakineer teams has 13 hours

03:32.253 --> 03:35.965
to design, bake and build their own
three-hole edible mini-golf course.

03:36.049 --> 03:40.511
All the fun for each hole has to fit
within a five-by-ten allotted space.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.641
Each of these courses have to be
cohesive and themed,

03:44.724 --> 03:47.060
and everyone on that team
can help one another.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.395
But each individual bakineering duo

03:49.479 --> 03:52.774
is responsible for one hole
within their team's course.

03:52.857 --> 03:55.193
We'll play both courses
in their entirety.

03:55.276 --> 03:57.445
We will choose
our favorite one overall.

03:57.528 --> 04:00.949
That entire combined team
will be safe from elimination.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.159
That'll leave us
with a combined losing team

04:03.243 --> 04:06.329
from which we'll have to decide
which duo are going home today.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.332
-Wow, harsh. A lot is on the line.
-It is.

04:09.415 --> 04:13.836
Randi, I'm gonna build the ramp to start,
'cause we've got that raised platform.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.005
From an engineering point of view,

04:16.089 --> 04:19.342
each of these holes has to feature
two obstacles.

04:19.425 --> 04:23.429
One has to be
at least three feet high and functional.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.556
That means something has to move.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.976
There could be rotation,
or a swinging element.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.019
Something can move up or down.

04:30.103 --> 04:35.608
But the key factor is that it has
an engineering principle incorporated.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.948
The main obstacle
needs to be made of cake,

04:42.031 --> 04:46.327
and it needs to tie into the overall theme
of the course and the taste.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.497
Isomalt, cornstarch.

04:49.580 --> 04:50.415
[grunts]

04:50.498 --> 04:54.127
Except for the underlying structural
and engineering components,

04:54.210 --> 04:57.588
everything has to be totally edible
and amazingly delicious.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.841
But we will be putting on Astroturf.

04:59.924 --> 05:03.303
If we were to putt on frosting,
I think it would be a little messy.

05:04.804 --> 05:05.847
-[Taylor] Steve.
-Yeah?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.808
Will chocolate come off
of wood fine if I can unfold this,

05:08.891 --> 05:11.060
or should I line it with
wax paper or spray it?

05:11.144 --> 05:14.188
I would line it with parchment paper,
then pour the chocolate,

05:14.272 --> 05:16.774
then lift the whole thing out
and pass the mold onward.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.610
-Cindy and Taylor. How are you?
-Hi, guys!

05:19.694 --> 05:20.611
[Andrew] Hello.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.114
[Dr. O] So, your engineering elements
are what?

05:23.197 --> 05:26.200
Two big elements. Got a isomalt bridge

05:26.284 --> 05:30.913
and then, for the larger one, we've got
a unicorn sitting on top of a doughnut,

05:30.997 --> 05:34.459
and, as an added obstacle,
it has a tongue that wiggles in between.

05:34.542 --> 05:35.668
-A tongue?
-Yeah.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.963
-[Cindy] A doughnut's tongue.
-This'd be the color of a doughnut tongue?

05:39.047 --> 05:39.922
[Dr. O] Ah, I see.

05:40.006 --> 05:43.801
So, starting off on our mini-golf hole,
you'll see our main obstacle,

05:43.885 --> 05:45.178
a very happy doughnut

05:45.261 --> 05:47.430
with a very dangerous swinging tongue.

05:47.513 --> 05:50.099
[Cindy] That's made
out of cake and ganache.

05:50.183 --> 05:53.061
[Taylor] On top of the doughnut
is our unicorn pal,

05:53.144 --> 05:56.189
who's made of Rice Krispies
and modeling chocolate.

05:56.272 --> 05:59.233
If you make it through, past the swinging
tongue of death,

05:59.317 --> 06:02.945
you'll hit a bank, which I made
out of sheet cake and fondant.

06:03.029 --> 06:05.948
Our dessert is a coffee chiffon cupcake

06:06.032 --> 06:09.035
with salted coffee cream
and a almond brittle,

06:09.118 --> 06:11.037
and that's sitting on top of the doughnut.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.955
The unicorn is protecting them.

06:13.039 --> 06:16.125
So, are you all making three separate,

06:16.209 --> 06:18.878
completely disjointed holes,

06:18.961 --> 06:20.088
or is there some--

06:20.171 --> 06:23.299
-Something bringing the three together?
-Fred is bringing it together.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.009
Yeah, we got a turtle.

06:25.093 --> 06:25.927
Ah!

06:26.010 --> 06:28.513
-Yeah.
-A turtle, who's the architect, of our--

06:28.596 --> 06:30.556
-The turtle architect.
-[Taylor] Yeah, exactly.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.725
-It sounds very Cindy and Taylor.
-Yes!

06:32.809 --> 06:34.811
-Best of luck.
-Thanks, guys.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
[upbeat music playing]

06:36.396 --> 06:38.272
[clock ticking]

06:38.356 --> 06:39.899
-[Rodolfo] So, Sara.
-Yes.

06:39.982 --> 06:42.485
I'm doing coconut fudge in one,

06:42.568 --> 06:45.405
coconut pastry cream in the other one,

06:45.488 --> 06:48.282
and I'm gonna start
the Italian buttercream very soon.

06:48.366 --> 06:51.327
I'll get this done.
We should do isomalt eyes that can spin.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.371
-That'll spin. Correct.
-I can go on top?

06:53.454 --> 06:55.748
We look forward
to developing a Candyland theme

06:55.832 --> 06:57.917
that's gonna just hit them
with vibrant colors

06:58.000 --> 07:00.211
and also bring back
some nostalgic memories

07:00.294 --> 07:02.130
that they may have gone through as kids.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.882
I am Mini-Golf Champion of the World.

07:04.966 --> 07:07.176
My kids know it. They've never beaten me.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.388
I'm a father of two kids.
My kids are my whole world.

07:10.471 --> 07:12.432
I'm here to win.
I wanna make my kids proud.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.643
They're gonna start here.
Okay? They're gonna tee.

07:16.394 --> 07:19.105
And they're gonna tee
through a sleeping unicorn.

07:19.188 --> 07:21.941
For this challenge,
I engineered a Candyland

07:22.024 --> 07:24.735
that has a beautiful baby unicorn.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.904
Go through the baby unicorn
through the mouth.

07:26.988 --> 07:29.073
Out the other side,
you'll find a mechanic door

07:29.157 --> 07:31.826
that opens and closes
for a gingerbread man.

07:31.909 --> 07:35.538
After the gingerbread man, you need to go
over a river of chocolate

07:35.621 --> 07:38.541
that has a bridge
made out of Rice Krispie treats,

07:38.624 --> 07:40.585
chocolate, graham crackers.

07:40.668 --> 07:45.173
Coming down from that bridge,
you will find an amazing explosion cake.

07:45.256 --> 07:49.343
And then you'll find the ramp
that has on top a rotating merry-go-round.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.929
And inside of that ramp,
you'll find the hole.

07:52.513 --> 07:55.016
As a team, I'm feeling
that we are upon a new challenge.

07:55.099 --> 07:56.684
We got close last time,

07:56.767 --> 07:59.687
but our engineering is
gonna take us to the top this time,

07:59.770 --> 08:01.689
because we have ramps, we have bridges,

08:01.772 --> 08:05.026
we have mechanisms with electronics
that are going to work this time.

08:05.109 --> 08:06.652
Because we are planning ahead.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.739
Joe, what's your tasting--
What's your delicious dessert?

08:09.822 --> 08:12.658
I developed a raspberry-whiskey Charlotte.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.576
[Brandi] Ooh!

08:13.659 --> 08:16.704
[Joey] We're gonna do a whiskey cream
and then build it up with raspberries.

08:16.787 --> 08:19.332
Almost like a terrine,
but an open-faced cake kind of thing.

08:19.415 --> 08:20.666
That sounds good.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.084
[clock ticking]

08:24.504 --> 08:27.715
Bakineers! Only ten hours left!

08:27.798 --> 08:29.050
Ten hours. Ten hours.

08:29.133 --> 08:30.676
Let's go. We're okay!

08:35.223 --> 08:39.727
For, like, unity of design
between all the Yellow Team,

08:39.810 --> 08:43.731
I'm making the same flags and signage,
so we all look cohesive.

08:43.814 --> 08:45.608
I don't think this is enough butter.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.569
That's not light and fluffy.
What do you have? Sugar?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.280
Just sugar, butter and vanilla.
Now I just put two eggs.

08:51.364 --> 08:55.660
You're not whipping it high enough.
Take the torch and heat it.

08:55.743 --> 08:59.413
The mountains are gonna be
on the corner on the edge

08:59.497 --> 09:01.290
so that it blocked the judges' way,

09:01.374 --> 09:04.877
so that they're forced
to go through the isomalt bridge.

09:05.586 --> 09:08.673
Maybe, like, bones type of thing?

09:08.756 --> 09:10.216
And golf balls?

09:10.299 --> 09:12.343
We came up with a graveyard theme,

09:12.426 --> 09:15.680
and we're trying to tie it in
with everybody's theme as the Yellow Team.

09:15.763 --> 09:20.017
So, the golf course,
we arrive at this massive gravestone,

09:20.101 --> 09:23.020
which you play the ball through.
When you reach the other side,

09:23.104 --> 09:25.147
you're now involved
with the chocolate bridge

09:25.231 --> 09:29.110
that you have to putt over
onto a three-foot-wide cake hole

09:29.193 --> 09:30.486
that you have to putt into.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.655
So then, on top will sit the turtle.

09:32.738 --> 09:35.533
So, he's sitting on top,
just hanging out in the swamp.

09:35.616 --> 09:39.328
We also are incorporating Fred
into each one of the holes.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.205
Yay!

09:43.165 --> 09:45.960
[singsong voice] It looks good!
It looks good!

09:46.043 --> 09:49.755
As for our main obstacle,
which is inside of the tombstone,

09:49.839 --> 09:52.842
this is a laser-cut piece of wood
covered with chocolate

09:52.925 --> 09:55.595
that's gonna be obstructing the ball
from going through.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.139
Failing again in the third mission

09:58.222 --> 10:01.350
has made it so that I have
a new instilled fire in me.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.353
I don't just need to make
something work in Mission Four,

10:04.437 --> 10:06.814
I need to blow the judges away.
Show them what I got.

10:06.897 --> 10:07.940
-Look!
-Oh, yeah. Cool.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.650
-That's how fast it moves.
-Sweet.

10:09.734 --> 10:12.111
It's just enough time
for them to putt it through.

10:12.194 --> 10:16.657
The edible portion of this is
a graveyard chocolate cake,

10:16.741 --> 10:18.659
drenched in raspberry blood,

10:18.743 --> 10:21.495
covered with a cream cheese,
dark chocolate frosting.

10:21.579 --> 10:24.832
This normally takes
about three hours in the oven.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.292
I'm doing thin sheets.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.337
I've always wanted to be the best
in my game. Not everybody does.

10:29.420 --> 10:32.632
School for me was very difficult.
I suffered from dyslexia.

10:32.715 --> 10:35.426
Growing through the school system,
I was just put down like,

10:35.509 --> 10:38.262
"Eh, guy's lazy.
He doesn't wanna learn. Can't teach him."

10:38.346 --> 10:41.223
So, from that I think
I've pushed through boundaries,

10:41.307 --> 10:45.061
maybe more than other people would put
because they don't have those struggles,

10:45.144 --> 10:46.562
and I proved them wrong.

10:46.646 --> 10:50.024
-Steve, what are you working on?
-I'm making the putting hole for the back.

10:50.107 --> 10:52.985
-I'm raising it, covering it in fondant.
-Oh, I love that.

10:53.069 --> 10:55.112
[clock ticking]

10:55.196 --> 10:56.447
Fore!

10:57.323 --> 10:58.532
[Joey] Hey!

10:59.116 --> 11:01.494
-Ho!
-Told you that'd get their attention.

11:01.577 --> 11:03.454
Rodolfo and Sara,

11:03.537 --> 11:06.624
you won a big boost in the last mission.

11:06.707 --> 11:11.629
Well, it happens to be
something literally very big

11:11.712 --> 11:13.839
that should help improve your score.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.594
Immunity. It says immunity right on it.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.681
-What? Oh!
-It's from the Bank of Immunity.

11:22.807 --> 11:24.141
[gasps]

11:24.225 --> 11:25.518
Oh!

11:25.601 --> 11:27.019
-I'm pretty jealous.
-I am too.

11:27.103 --> 11:31.524
First of all, we had two advantages,
and none of them were as cool as immunity.

11:31.607 --> 11:34.443
What that means is no matter what happens,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.737
you guys are safe in this mission.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.740
You mean
I did all these Rice Krispies for nothing?

11:39.824 --> 11:43.411
You know, I just did a little math,
and I know, a magician doing math, LOL.

11:43.494 --> 11:47.998
But, seriously, Green Team,
if you end up on the bottom,

11:48.582 --> 11:53.796
it means Brandi and Menuka
and Joey and Mario each have

11:53.879 --> 11:56.090
a 50/50 shot at going home.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.341
Ooh!

11:57.425 --> 11:59.593
-Anyway, have fun, guys!
-[judges laugh]

12:00.177 --> 12:01.762
No pressure though. It's okay. Thanks.

12:01.846 --> 12:05.349
Can you send the whole Yellow Team home,
so we can enjoy it?

12:05.433 --> 12:06.976
[Brandi laughing]

12:07.059 --> 12:09.019
[clock ticking]

12:09.603 --> 12:12.898
This is like a cloud
that came from my dreams.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.316
Your dreams are this cute?

12:15.192 --> 12:16.569
[Steve] Did you grease your hands?

12:16.652 --> 12:19.405
Spray each hand,
and then just rub your hands together.

12:19.488 --> 12:22.742
We're making Renee's hands
modeled out of chocolate…

12:22.825 --> 12:23.993
Fill 'em up.

12:24.076 --> 12:27.955
…which come out of the river at you,
as you go over the chocolate bridge.

12:28.038 --> 12:32.376
Look at Steve and Renee.
I think they're doing a mold. Cool!

12:32.460 --> 12:34.587
[Steve] Gonna put this in the fridge
to set.

12:34.670 --> 12:36.964
I heard you had some macadamia nuts.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.842
-They're in the oven. You can't have 'em.
-Oh, man.

12:39.925 --> 12:41.218
-I need all of them.
-All right.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.304
[clock ticking]

12:45.973 --> 12:47.433
Menuka's making the ice rink.

12:47.516 --> 12:49.435
[Brandi] He's making the channel
for our trapdoor.

12:49.518 --> 12:51.729
Hopefully, by the time that's done,

12:51.812 --> 12:54.023
the cakes will be
out of the oven and chilled,

12:54.106 --> 12:56.275
and then we'll--
Ready to be… start building.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.863
-It's a team effort. It's a team effort.
-Sure is. I love it. Freakin' love it.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.658
For this mission, we are building
a polar-themed mini-golf hole.

13:04.742 --> 13:08.662
In the middle,
the golfer will have to hit the ball

13:08.746 --> 13:12.291
through a giant iceberg
where there's a trapdoor.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.629
-The height-- Is this enough, you think?
-Yeah.

13:16.712 --> 13:20.216
When the ball goes through the iceberg,
Menuka's gonna engineer a magic trick.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.635
-So we just place the ball right in here.
-Yeah.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.845
Joey and Mario
are doing a similar thing, right?

13:24.929 --> 13:27.348
If theirs doesn't work,
we'll make it like this one.

13:27.431 --> 13:28.974
-Exactly like this one.
-Nice job.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.684
The ball will change colors

13:30.768 --> 13:34.021
when it goes through the iceberg to,
hopefully, impress the judges.

13:34.605 --> 13:39.109
On top of the iceberg will be
cute little butternut squash penguins

13:39.193 --> 13:43.739
with modeling chocolate for the wings.
Airbrush 'em, make 'em look realistic.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.659
Right, these two little guys are done
and ready to be painted.

13:46.742 --> 13:50.538
The dessert portion will be
lemon cake with lemon curd

13:50.621 --> 13:52.331
and cream cheese buttercream.

13:53.624 --> 13:54.500
[clock ticking]

13:54.583 --> 13:57.795
Four… hours left!

13:57.878 --> 13:59.421
[groans]

13:59.505 --> 14:01.298
Just breathe, Brandi. Just breathe.

14:07.888 --> 14:11.475
I'm gonna ganache it. So, do you think
white ganache or chocolate ganache?

14:11.559 --> 14:13.644
I'm gonna use
colored cocoa butter to color it.

14:13.727 --> 14:15.813
Right. I would do it on white.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.898
-I wouldn't use a dark compound.
-Right?

14:17.982 --> 14:19.942
[clicks tongue] Go, girl.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.030
-What are you working on?
-Ganache.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.824
-I'm gonna let it--
-For the turtles?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.742
Yeah, for the turtle. For Fred.

14:28.826 --> 14:32.788
So, our mini-golf course is
going to be Hawaiian-themed.

14:32.872 --> 14:37.960
Once you hit the ball, you're gonna go
through a giant volcanic lava rock

14:38.043 --> 14:41.589
made out of Rice Krispie treats
and then coated in chocolate,

14:41.672 --> 14:45.593
which Fred, our giant turtle,
will be sitting atop.

14:46.093 --> 14:50.973
Once you're past Fred's giant lava rock,
you're gonna go up this wooden ramp,

14:51.056 --> 14:54.518
and then you'll go past
our giant volcano and geyser,

14:54.602 --> 14:59.732
made out of sheet cake covered in fondant,
and have chocolate lava streaming down it.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.318
Fred the turtle
is going to be the cake part.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.988
He's going to be Turtle cake. How apropos.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.533
It's a delicious, light chocolate cake

15:09.617 --> 15:12.870
with salted caramel icing
and toasted macadamia nuts.

15:12.953 --> 15:14.955
How are you on icing, Jacob?

15:15.039 --> 15:16.165
Way enough.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.168
[clock ticking]

15:21.295 --> 15:23.339
Cindy, do you have freeze spray near you?

15:23.422 --> 15:25.424
-I do!
-Could you hand it to me?

15:25.507 --> 15:29.678
Yah. Don't do it too much,
'cause making it too cold cracks isomalt.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.645
[Steve] All right.
Let's get these in the freezer.

15:41.273 --> 15:42.483
-Sara?
-Yes, sir.

15:42.566 --> 15:43.943
What are you building there?

15:44.026 --> 15:47.571
I'm driving the Struggle Bus.
About to throw this one through a wall.

15:48.405 --> 15:50.366
We have landed
on a "heaven and hell" theme.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.826
Our course starts with a big ramp

15:52.910 --> 15:56.038
made of stacked cakes
and Rice Krispie treats

15:56.121 --> 15:57.831
that represents the Tree of Life.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.292
At the top,
you've got the two gate options.

16:00.376 --> 16:04.046
One, a small door for heaven,
because the pathway to heaven is narrow.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.340
Make it through this hole,
you get a hole-in-one.

16:06.423 --> 16:09.677
Make it through the hell hole,
you'll go through the seven deadly sins.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.513
[Rodolfo] For the desserts,
I'm gonna do a dark chocolate cake

16:12.596 --> 16:16.850
with a coconut filling and a coconut fudge
and a coconut pastry cream.

16:18.435 --> 16:19.895
Less chat. Play.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.440
-[Joey] Jammed again.
-[Mario] Jammed in the mouth.

16:23.524 --> 16:24.900
It's got to be soft.

16:27.820 --> 16:30.364
I'm worried the ball may
get stuck inside of the unicorn.

16:30.447 --> 16:33.701
[Joey] We've learned the importance
of testing over the past few missions.

16:33.784 --> 16:34.952
We gotta understand

16:35.035 --> 16:37.871
that nothing is gonna work
just because we're good guys.

16:37.955 --> 16:40.916
It's gonna work
because we tested it a thousand times

16:41.000 --> 16:43.002
and understand the principles
of our crafts.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.503
It didn't give me a problem before.

16:44.586 --> 16:46.588
[Mario] Try again.
It needs to be foolproof.

16:48.465 --> 16:49.758
Jammed, didn't it?

16:50.968 --> 16:52.886
-Hola!
-Mario! Hola!

16:52.970 --> 16:54.888
-How are you?
-Good.

16:54.972 --> 16:57.516
-How are you doing?
-The engineering's--

16:57.599 --> 17:01.520
-Electronic is on. Testing as we build.
-[Joey] We're testing and testing.

17:01.603 --> 17:06.025
I decided to bring all the tools,
so I can be close to Joey and communicate,

17:06.108 --> 17:08.652
'cause I think
that after our first mission,

17:08.736 --> 17:12.656
we were very apart. I was over there,
just geeking on my own stuff.

17:12.740 --> 17:15.617
I grew up in a family of engineers.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.620
My dad's an engineer.
My brother's an engineer.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.955
I love challenging myself.

17:20.497 --> 17:23.792
I think that that's what keeps me alive,
makes my blood pump.

17:23.876 --> 17:27.296
Every opportunity to perform
is an opportunity to excel.

17:27.379 --> 17:30.924
So, challenges are for driven people,

17:31.008 --> 17:33.093
and I consider myself a driven guy.

17:33.177 --> 17:37.139
At the moment, I can see a lot of wood.
I'm intrigued how you're gonna cover it.

17:37.222 --> 17:42.019
We have that into consideration,
and we are gonna do the best we can.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.271
[Joanne] This is super exciting.
Thank you so much.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.856
-Thank you, guys.
-Good luck.

17:47.816 --> 17:49.193
[Brandi] Are you stressed out?

17:49.693 --> 17:53.363
I think it's the biggest lie when you say,
"I'm fine," you know,

17:53.447 --> 17:54.531
you're not always fine.

17:54.615 --> 17:58.577
I noticed that when I give you a hug,
you seem to calm down.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.746
-With my kids, I have a hug timer.
-Uh-huh?

18:00.829 --> 18:05.501
So, it goes off three times a day.
And when it goes off, I just--

18:05.584 --> 18:07.795
We stop what we're doing
and we hug each other.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.380
-Want me to set a hug timer?
-Let's put a hug timer on.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.632
[Brandi] I'll set one.

18:11.715 --> 18:14.718
Yeah, you guys should learn from us too.
We're gonna do a hug time.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.638
-[Sara] Group hugs in 20 minutes?
-Yeah!

18:17.721 --> 18:18.889
[timer beeping]

18:18.972 --> 18:22.226
We got the hug timer. Done.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.273
[grunts]

18:28.357 --> 18:30.567
-I'm good.
-[Sara] Towels over here?

18:31.610 --> 18:32.528
One more.

18:34.655 --> 18:38.200
I am adding Rice Krispie Treats
on the border of the chocolate river.

18:40.035 --> 18:42.162
This cable needs to come in the front?

18:42.246 --> 18:45.332
We could hide them through here,
now that the cake is in place.

18:45.415 --> 18:48.293
Unless you wanna slide this forward.
We can put it back here.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.255
-We're gonna do the other ones--
-We can think about it.

18:51.338 --> 18:53.799
-Don't forget the unicorn horn, okay?
-Okay.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.301
[Joey] I don't wanna go out there
with a colorful horse.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.178
-[timer beeping]
-It's the hug timer, Menuka.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.888
-Hug time, hug time!
-Hug time!

18:59.972 --> 19:03.308
-Group hug time! Real quick.
-Hug time! Group hug time!

19:03.392 --> 19:04.768
Yeah. You good?

19:05.310 --> 19:07.437
-That's a good hug.
-That is a good hug!

19:07.521 --> 19:10.440
-[Joey] You guys are hugging?
-Here we-- Okay!

19:10.524 --> 19:12.025
-How are you guys doing?
-Good.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.235
-Yeah.
-All right.

19:13.318 --> 19:15.320
[clock ticking]

19:19.324 --> 19:21.076
[Cindy] Okay. I'm good on the doughnut.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.662
I'm gonna start
doing some drips on the mountains.

19:23.745 --> 19:26.665
Three, two--

19:27.749 --> 19:30.919
I am so excited.
I'm, like, screaming inside,

19:31.003 --> 19:33.881
because I'm seeing
something that is working.

19:35.799 --> 19:38.260
It's time for you guys
to prepare for the stress test.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.012
Your tee time is fast-approaching.

19:40.095 --> 19:41.972
-Golfing gloves on.
-Go get limbered up.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.148
[clock ticking]

19:52.274 --> 19:54.735
Teams, only 30 minutes left!

19:55.235 --> 19:57.237
[tense music playing]

20:06.872 --> 20:09.541
In a way, it's okay,
because it's a graveyard.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.585
You may not have
all your fingers and toes.

20:11.668 --> 20:13.629
-[Renee] Ew!
-We can just lay the fingers in place.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.467
[Taylor] Oh, my goodness.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.311
Bakineers, five minutes left!

20:29.811 --> 20:32.981
I'll move the fences,
'cause they're very fragile, okay?

20:33.982 --> 20:35.943
-Here's your sign.
-Love it.

20:36.026 --> 20:37.694
-You like it? Good to go.
-Thank you.

20:39.363 --> 20:42.282
[Justin] Ten, nine, eight,

20:42.366 --> 20:45.202
seven, six, five,

20:45.285 --> 20:49.498
four, three, two, one.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.502
Wires and whisks down! Your time is up!

20:53.585 --> 20:55.337
Dude, we got issues.

20:57.339 --> 20:58.465
We're out of time,

20:58.548 --> 21:03.804
and I just realized
that we forgot the unicorn horn and ears.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.975
But it's a baby.
Babies don't have horns when they grow up.

21:08.058 --> 21:11.395
-It's a baby unicorn. Problem solved.
-There you go. It's how you sell it.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.815
I'm not saying anything,
but as a perfectionist, I know--

21:14.898 --> 21:17.693
-[softly] Dude, it looks awesome.
-Bakineers!

21:19.861 --> 21:23.615
Are you ready for your Baking Impossible
mini-golf stress test?

21:23.699 --> 21:24.950
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

21:25.033 --> 21:26.410
-Yeah!
-Yes!

21:26.493 --> 21:28.203
-All right!
-[Justin] I'm very excited.

21:28.704 --> 21:31.832
In fact, I brought my golf bag.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.876
Got everything I need in it.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.671
Got my golf ball.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.134
And, of course, I've got my--

21:45.387 --> 21:46.471
Got my club.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.516
-Let's play!
-Oh, my God.

21:49.599 --> 21:50.767
Bakineers,

21:51.935 --> 21:55.063
it is time
for your stress test to begin.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.524
[Jacob] Jesus.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.111
Hello, judges. Hey, can I get a ride?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.529
-Yeah, hop in.
-All right.

22:02.612 --> 22:04.948
-Yes!
-Thank you, my friend.

22:05.532 --> 22:09.619
Keep it on the right side of the road.
Teams, come on down!

22:09.703 --> 22:10.829
[Renee] Yay!

22:11.705 --> 22:12.706
[coughing]

22:12.789 --> 22:15.959
-You guys were downwind. I apologize.
-[laughing] We're good.

22:16.835 --> 22:21.089
Welcome to your Baking Impossible
Mini-Golf Stress Test.

22:22.257 --> 22:24.301
Today, we'll play each of your two courses

22:24.384 --> 22:26.345
and then choose our favorite overall.

22:26.845 --> 22:30.057
The team from our favorite course
is safe from elimination.

22:30.557 --> 22:33.602
Sadly, one bakineering duo
from the losing course

22:33.685 --> 22:35.187
will be going home today.

22:36.104 --> 22:42.152
Remember, you're all fighting
for a chance to win the $100,000 prize

22:42.235 --> 22:45.781
and the title of World's Best Bakineers.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.283
Up first, Yellow Team.

22:48.367 --> 22:52.245
The theme of Thrills, Frills and Chills.

22:52.329 --> 22:55.332
Bringing the frills,
we have Cindy and Taylor.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.210
-Andrew, you want me to drive this time?
-Oh, I got it.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.586
[Dr. O chuckling]

23:00.253 --> 23:01.088
Oh!

23:01.171 --> 23:03.757
-Let me get on.
-[Justin] Okay, right side of the road.

23:03.840 --> 23:06.176
We're excited
the judges get to play our hole first,

23:06.259 --> 23:08.637
because that means
we get to set their expectations.

23:08.720 --> 23:11.098
They're not comparing it
against any other hole.

23:11.181 --> 23:13.100
Just don't hit the unicorn.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.311
Cindy and Taylor,
tell us about your mini-golf hole.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.523
[Taylor] Our golf hole is Unicornucopia.

23:19.606 --> 23:21.733
This course fits
with the whole rest of ours,

23:21.817 --> 23:25.320
and our scenic landscape
of Thrills, Chills and Frills.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.488
And this'd be the--?

23:26.571 --> 23:28.198
-Frills.
-[Justin] This is the frills.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.826
[Taylor] You'll notice a few
common elements between all of them.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.495
The first of which is our friend,
Fred the turtle,

23:33.578 --> 23:36.081
which you'll see
on all golf course employee uniforms,

23:36.164 --> 23:39.209
as well as in each of our courses,
and on our flag.

23:39.960 --> 23:42.003
Talk us through
what everything is made of.

23:42.087 --> 23:44.840
From the front to the back,
we've got tee markers,

23:44.923 --> 23:47.092
which are made of white chocolate coating.

23:47.175 --> 23:49.386
Our giant doughnut is fully cake.

23:49.469 --> 23:51.471
The unicorn is fondant and Rice--

23:51.555 --> 23:53.598
-Modeling chocolate.
-Why don't you take over.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.685
[Cindy] The unicorn is modeling chocolate,
and then we have edible glitter,

23:56.768 --> 23:58.437
and an isomalt bridge.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.773
-Go, Joanne. Very excited.
-[Joanne] Okay.

24:01.857 --> 24:05.068
-Watch the swing of that tongue.
-Oops, I didn't mean to hit it.

24:05.152 --> 24:07.612
-That's one.
-No, no, no, no!

24:08.113 --> 24:09.322
[upbeat music playing]

24:10.740 --> 24:11.575
[judges] Oh!

24:15.370 --> 24:16.621
[judges exclaiming]

24:16.705 --> 24:17.539
Man!

24:20.208 --> 24:21.293
[judges exclaiming]

24:21.376 --> 24:23.628
The glitter trap. Okay, here we go.

24:23.712 --> 24:25.380
[Dr. O] Oh!

24:26.673 --> 24:28.300
[all] Yeah!

24:30.385 --> 24:31.887
-[Justin] Nice!
-That was hard!

24:31.970 --> 24:34.097
-[Dr. O] New course record.
-[Justin] How'd it feel?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.308
-It was fun.
-Cindy and Taylor, thanks so much.

24:36.391 --> 24:38.268
This is fun.
Got us off to a great start.

24:38.351 --> 24:41.104
Judges, grab your clubs,
and let's travel on.

24:41.188 --> 24:45.650
And now for the chills
of Chills, Thrills and Frills.

24:45.734 --> 24:46.818
Steve and Renee.

24:46.902 --> 24:51.781
I definitely feel like this course is
going to be a wow factor for the judges.

24:51.865 --> 24:54.201
Here we are at the second hole already.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.535
Steve and Renee.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.871
Our hole is called

24:57.954 --> 25:00.165
Fred's Golf Ball Graveyard,

25:00.248 --> 25:03.543
where Fred the turtle
is now in a graveyard

25:03.627 --> 25:05.504
in a bone-chilling scene.

25:05.587 --> 25:07.589
For the engineering perspective,

25:07.672 --> 25:10.509
we have the motor
in front of the tombstone.

25:11.051 --> 25:15.096
So, we have Renee's hands,
that have been crafted out of chocolate

25:15.180 --> 25:18.266
with broken fingers,
as she's climbing out of the grave.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.352
We have chocolate fences,

25:20.435 --> 25:25.023
and then the whole putting green
at the end is an edible chocolate cake,

25:25.899 --> 25:28.360
drenched in a blood raspberry syrup,

25:29.194 --> 25:34.074
covered with a cream cheese,
dark chocolate graveyard frosting.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.200
[judges] Mmm.

25:35.283 --> 25:37.744
-[Dr. O] Okay.
-Never had graveyard frosting.

25:38.328 --> 25:40.163
Andrew, you're playing this hole.

25:40.747 --> 25:41.581
[Dr. O] He missed.

25:42.165 --> 25:43.041
[Justin] Nice.

25:43.124 --> 25:44.376
[Joanne] Oh!

25:44.459 --> 25:46.294
-[Justin] The grave.
-[Steve] Right to the hand.

25:46.795 --> 25:49.923
[Justin] He's having to hit that ball
back down to the base of the bridge.

25:50.006 --> 25:52.551
-Not bad. Not bad. Here.
-Okay.

25:53.510 --> 25:57.264
-[Joanne] Oh, nice!
-[Justin] Nice! Up and over the bridge.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.100
You're in the Oreo crumb pit right now.

26:01.351 --> 26:02.561
[all] Yay!

26:02.644 --> 26:04.020
-Nice.
-Really good.

26:04.104 --> 26:07.899
Steve, Renee, thanks for letting us play
Fred's Golf Ball Graveyard.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.859
-Judges, to hole number three.
-Okay.

26:09.943 --> 26:12.195
And finally our thrills

26:12.279 --> 26:15.407
for Frills, Chills and Thrills,
Randi and Jacob.

26:15.490 --> 26:16.449
Wow, Fred got big.

26:17.742 --> 26:22.789
I would like to welcome you to Hawaii,
aka, Fred's Thrilling Paradise.

26:22.872 --> 26:26.501
You'll notice that Fred is
a very curious little turtle there.

26:26.585 --> 26:29.296
He does peek his head out
ever so occasionally.

26:29.379 --> 26:32.007
We also have our steaming volcano up here,

26:32.090 --> 26:33.633
made entirely of cake.

26:33.717 --> 26:38.096
There are a few surprises, assuming
you do sink the ball in the hole,

26:38.179 --> 26:40.515
including our predictable geyser.

26:40.599 --> 26:43.310
I know that geysers are known
for being unpredictable,

26:43.393 --> 26:46.354
but I will say,
if you do get the ball in the hole,

26:46.438 --> 26:48.732
our geyser will start
to go off in celebration.

26:48.815 --> 26:50.358
-That's a big "if."
-[Jacob] Yes.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.110
It's all edible.

26:52.193 --> 26:54.988
The lava rock is sculpted
from Rice Krispie treats.

26:55.071 --> 26:57.991
Our lava pit is chocolate
and rice cereal treats.

26:58.074 --> 27:00.368
Fred himself is your dessert treat.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.454
So, he is a chocolate cake

27:02.537 --> 27:06.875
with salted caramel buttercream,
caramel and toasted macadamia nuts.

27:07.542 --> 27:09.794
[Justin] Well, Dr. O,
this is your time to shine.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.173
[Dr. O gasps]

27:13.256 --> 27:15.342
Oh, my-- Oh, buddy.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.719
-How many strokes penalty is the--?
-[Randi] The lava pit?

27:17.802 --> 27:19.512
[Justin] It's in the lava pit right there?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.514
-Eight, maybe?
-Yeah, maybe eight.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.309
All right, he's putting for eagle here.

27:24.392 --> 27:26.353
[softly] Dr. O hasn't got
a hole-in-one in him.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.023
[loudly] Did you say
Dr. O could never do a hole-in-one?

27:30.106 --> 27:32.651
-That's exactly what I said, Joanne.
-With these muscles--

27:32.734 --> 27:34.319
-[judges chuckling]
-[Dr. O] Whoo!

27:37.697 --> 27:39.240
[all] Oh!

27:39.949 --> 27:42.494
Dr. O, explain to us the science
behind what happened.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.873
I could've made a hole-in-one.
I added suspense.

27:48.249 --> 27:49.459
[Justin] This is exciting.

27:49.542 --> 27:52.379
There we go! Dr. O with a three.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.546
[all] Yay!

27:53.630 --> 27:55.882
-And wait for it.
-[Dr. O] The flag! Wow!

27:55.965 --> 27:59.761
We got the flag and geyser!
Predictable geyser.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.097
-All right.
-Was it as fun as it looked?

28:02.180 --> 28:03.264
It was really fun.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.933
[Justin] That's it for the Yellow Course.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.559
Randi, Jacob, thank you so much.

28:06.643 --> 28:07.560
[Rodolfo] Whoo!

28:08.645 --> 28:10.480
[suspenseful music playing]

28:12.941 --> 28:13.775
[Randi] Poor Fred.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.408
Cindy and Taylor,
please bring us your cake.

28:21.491 --> 28:22.409
[Taylor] Sounds good.

28:26.788 --> 28:27.747
[Joanne] Thank you.

28:28.581 --> 28:31.501
This is a coffee chiffon cupcake
with a salted coffee cream

28:32.085 --> 28:33.628
and a almond brittle.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.048
Well, the coffee chiffon cake
is light and airy.

28:37.132 --> 28:41.094
The cream is well-infused with coffee
and it's well-balanced.

28:41.177 --> 28:46.015
I'd love to see a little bit more depth
in terms of your pastry talents.

28:46.099 --> 28:48.727
Everything has been
a whipped cream or a sponge cake.

28:48.810 --> 28:51.229
As far as the engineering
of your course goes,

28:51.312 --> 28:54.315
the obstacles weren't really obstacles.

28:54.399 --> 28:58.778
The tongue in the doughnut is perhaps
more of a distraction than an obstacle.

28:58.862 --> 29:01.030
Everything worked. That's good.

29:01.114 --> 29:05.160
Nothing blew my mind.
The isomalt bridge did impress me.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.161
Understood.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.539
Cindy, Taylor, I do think
from a playability point of view,

29:09.622 --> 29:12.834
we maybe could've brought
some of those other amazing cake elements

29:12.917 --> 29:15.170
onto the course
to perhaps be more of an obstacle.

29:16.254 --> 29:17.756
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

29:17.839 --> 29:19.215
Steve and Renee.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.634
[Steve] So, here we have
dark chocolate cake

29:21.718 --> 29:23.428
drenched with raspberry coulis,

29:23.511 --> 29:27.515
layered with a dark chocolate,
cream cheese frosting.

29:27.599 --> 29:31.686
Steve, I love this cake.
There is a nice acidic element to it.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.856
Having a little bit of acid
is like having a little bit of salt.

29:34.939 --> 29:36.733
It wakes up the flavors,

29:36.816 --> 29:39.652
and, when you eat it,
it makes you want to keep going back,

29:39.736 --> 29:41.362
because it's not all one note.

29:41.446 --> 29:42.322
Thank you.

29:42.405 --> 29:45.742
I think you've designed
a very striking mini-golf hole today.

29:45.825 --> 29:49.662
Some of the aspects that I really enjoyed
were how you had that color grading

29:49.746 --> 29:51.873
between your Astroturf
to blend with your theme.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.125
The chocolate bridge
I thought was very clever.

29:54.209 --> 29:56.544
I loved to see the ball travel
over something edible

29:56.628 --> 29:59.631
and you're not relying on support.
Very well done on those aspects.

29:59.714 --> 30:03.885
Steve and Renee, you're a team,
but I have to address Renee.

30:04.844 --> 30:06.679
Renee, great job.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.351
-Yay!
-Every mechanism worked beautifully.

30:11.434 --> 30:16.648
You have your wind vane shutter mechanism
on your tombstone there.

30:16.731 --> 30:22.403
And the bridge design is
a beautiful, functional chocolate bridge.

30:22.487 --> 30:25.990
Everything just came together really well
from an engineering perspective,

30:26.074 --> 30:27.325
and so, I gotta say,

30:27.408 --> 30:30.245
Steve, you need to step up your game, man,
to match Renee.

30:30.328 --> 30:31.663
-Okay?
-I'll try.

30:32.372 --> 30:33.706
Randi and Jacob.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.168
[Randi] This is a Turtle cake,
after Fred.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.463
He was very sweet
to allow you to taste him.

30:40.547 --> 30:44.592
It is a chocolate cake
with salted caramel icing,

30:44.676 --> 30:47.762
caramel and roasted macadamia nuts,

30:47.846 --> 30:50.098
and a little bit
of ganache on the outside.

30:50.181 --> 30:52.183
-The cake is really delicious.
-Thank you.

30:52.267 --> 30:54.894
It is really rich and chocolatey.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.062
I love the crunch.

30:56.145 --> 30:59.899
It adds a really nice textural component
to the whole cake.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.111
I love even the little bit
of ganache on the edge

31:03.194 --> 31:06.573
that adds a little bit of bitterness,
because it's a little sweet in the middle.

31:06.656 --> 31:07.949
Mmm-hmm.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.577
I think you've designed
a stunning-looking course.

31:10.660 --> 31:14.414
A particular mention would have to go
to your completely edible mountain,

31:14.497 --> 31:17.292
and the tunnel,
and, of course, Fred on top.

31:17.375 --> 31:20.879
Playability-wise, that volcano,
could it have been more center stage?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.714
Could we've taken a tour around it?

31:22.797 --> 31:26.926
It was perhaps a little bit
straight line of sight, play-wise,

31:27.010 --> 31:28.553
from the start to the end.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.221
[Dr. O] Randi and Jacob,

31:30.305 --> 31:34.225
I first have to apologize to you both
for making your course seem so easy.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.228
I know it really is
a very difficult course.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.898
But if I were to talk
about the engineering,

31:39.981 --> 31:42.609
there were some elements
that I absolutely loved,

31:42.692 --> 31:45.695
and they were the rewards
at the end, right?

31:45.778 --> 31:48.281
Once you get the ball in the hole,
stuff happens.

31:48.364 --> 31:50.116
Triggered activity

31:50.199 --> 31:51.367
that is wonderful.

31:51.451 --> 31:54.287
Thing I like about you guys
is that you typically make stuff

31:54.370 --> 31:57.206
that tastes good, looks good and works.

31:57.707 --> 31:59.792
So, when are you gonna win a round?

32:00.710 --> 32:03.046
-I don't know.
-Hopefully soon.

32:03.546 --> 32:07.759
Randi and Jacob, thank you very much.
And, Yellow Team, well done.

32:10.720 --> 32:14.098
Okay, Green Team,
your theme was Sweet Cycle.

32:14.182 --> 32:16.559
First up, we've got Joey and Mario.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.937
I think the judges will find
our course exciting.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.899
They were saying that
all other courses were not very exciting

32:22.982 --> 32:27.654
in terms of-- There's not many obstacles.
We have 11 obstacles in our course.

32:27.737 --> 32:30.990
First hole of the Green Course
belongs to Joey and Mario.

32:31.074 --> 32:32.283
Tell us about your hole.

32:33.785 --> 32:37.497
[Mario] In front of you, judges,
our very young, male unicorn.

32:37.580 --> 32:41.000
I say he's very young,
because he hasn't developed yet his horn.

32:41.584 --> 32:46.214
So you will need to go with the ball
through his mouth, coming out of his tail.

32:46.297 --> 32:48.508
-[Justin] Comes out the butt?
-Yeah.

32:50.051 --> 32:52.553
And then you're gonna find Sugar Mountain.

32:52.637 --> 32:56.057
Through the Sugar Mountain
and come out of gingerbread man's mouth.

32:56.140 --> 32:59.519
After that, you will need to go
through our s'more bridge,

32:59.602 --> 33:04.440
and then you need to go
through a ramp uphill and make your hole.

33:04.524 --> 33:07.193
[Justin] Joey, can you talk us through
what everything is made of?

33:07.276 --> 33:09.153
[Joey] The unicorn
is made entirely out of cake.

33:09.237 --> 33:13.241
When you get to Sugar Mountain,
this is gingerbread, royal icing.

33:13.324 --> 33:17.537
We have a cereal treat bridge
that's covered in s'mores,

33:17.620 --> 33:20.289
and gets to our cake
and our final dessert,

33:20.373 --> 33:21.708
the raspberry Charlotte.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.544
I've gotta prove myself
after the Yellow Course.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.007
Ooh! Ooh…

33:30.049 --> 33:31.801
[Andrew] This isn't going to be glamorous.

33:32.343 --> 33:36.222
I've seen Arnold Palmer do this technique.
It's called "gagging the unicorn."

33:36.305 --> 33:38.641
-I guess this-- [laughs] Okay.
-[Justin] Don't Google that.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.644
[Dr. O] Oh!

33:42.729 --> 33:45.481
[Justin] He's unfazed by the unicorn.
Very nice putt.

33:45.565 --> 33:46.399
[Joanne] Nice.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.026
-Good putt.
-A perfect layup.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.571
-Well done. Perfect layup.
-[Joanne] Well done!

33:54.240 --> 33:56.659
[Justin] And up and-- He decided to take…

33:56.743 --> 33:57.827
[Mario] I made it concave.

33:57.910 --> 33:59.912
…the scenic route. He likes the view.

33:59.996 --> 34:03.082
He's taking in the view
here at the top, Andrew.

34:03.166 --> 34:06.377
-Well done. Perfect layup.
-[Andrew] This is very cautious play.

34:06.461 --> 34:07.920
[Joey and Justin exclaiming]

34:08.004 --> 34:10.339
-[Justin] It was so close.
-I'm gonna snooker cue this in.

34:10.423 --> 34:12.884
-Snooker cue?
-I'm gonna go for an unconventional--

34:12.967 --> 34:15.011
[Justin] He's using the shaft in his club.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.971
[cheering]

34:17.055 --> 34:18.139
[Justin] Ten.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.892
-Joey and Mario, thanks very much.
-Thank you.

34:20.975 --> 34:22.977
Let's see
what hole number two holds for us.

34:23.644 --> 34:27.065
Up next in the Sweet Cycle,
Brandi and Menuka.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.735
I'm excited about this stress test!

34:30.818 --> 34:33.988
Honestly, I want to play so bad,
because it's so cool, you know?

34:34.072 --> 34:34.906
I wanna play bad.

34:34.989 --> 34:39.869
But at the same time, in my mind,
what happens now-- The magic trick fails?

34:39.952 --> 34:41.287
[chuckles nervously]

34:41.370 --> 34:42.914
Welcome to the Penguin Land.

34:44.707 --> 34:48.002
Our beautiful, mini-penguin-themed,
putt-putt course.

34:48.086 --> 34:51.756
As I was looking around the kitchen,
I saw butternut squash, and I thought,

34:51.839 --> 34:54.050
"Those would be so cute as penguins."

34:54.133 --> 34:58.096
The top of the penguin is
made out of modeling chocolate.

34:58.679 --> 35:00.765
Tell us what's happening engineering-wise.

35:00.848 --> 35:04.727
We have a trap door. So, basically,
you have to time yourself very well.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.648
And also,
there's a tiny surprise inside too.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.359
So, this time,
I don't want to overcomplicate things,

35:11.442 --> 35:14.570
because, as you know,
I'm a champion of overcomplicating things.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.240
And Brandi, where's the cake
we're going to be tasting?

35:17.323 --> 35:19.492
It's in the top of the snow cave.

35:19.575 --> 35:22.745
I did a lemon cake with a lemon curd,
and a cream cheese buttercream.

35:22.829 --> 35:24.205
[Joanne] Ooh!

35:24.288 --> 35:27.792
I do have to ask. I noticed
that the penguins have a note here

35:27.875 --> 35:29.585
to Titus and Larkin.

35:29.669 --> 35:30.753
[Brandi] Those are my kids.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.381
-Is this dedicated to Titus and Larkin?
-It is.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.550
We usually go snow tubing up north,

35:35.633 --> 35:38.594
and we're always playing
in the snow together, sledding.

35:38.678 --> 35:40.555
It's one of our
favorite things to do, so…

35:40.638 --> 35:43.891
-All right, Joanne, do us proud.
-Okay.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.476
Joanne is at the tee.

35:49.772 --> 35:51.315
-She made it.
-[Joanne] Wait a minute!

35:51.399 --> 35:52.483
-That's not my--
-Wait!

35:52.567 --> 35:55.027
-That's not my ball.
-[Brandi and Menuka] It's a magic ball!

35:55.111 --> 35:56.028
Magic!

35:56.654 --> 36:00.616
-It turned from purple to green! Wow!
-[Brandi] Little bit.

36:00.700 --> 36:02.743
I got this. Okay, here I go.

36:06.205 --> 36:07.039
[all cheering]

36:10.418 --> 36:14.797
-Yes!
-That was so effortless and confident.

36:14.881 --> 36:16.048
Joanne with the birdie.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.426
[Dr. O] I know. Magic trick and a birdie.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.469
Judges, on to hole number three.

36:21.053 --> 36:24.098
And, finally, for the Sweet Cycle,
Sara and Rodolfo.

36:26.017 --> 36:29.729
While I'm looking at the Green side,
I don't see any matching elements

36:29.812 --> 36:32.523
that are bringing the team together.

36:32.607 --> 36:36.569
And when I look at the Yellow side,
I'm seeing the flags and the pins,

36:37.486 --> 36:40.698
and I feel like we're stronger
in the cohesive course element,

36:40.781 --> 36:41.908
in comparison.

36:41.991 --> 36:44.493
Sweet Cycle is the name of our course.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.706
Made it to the final judgment. All right?

36:48.789 --> 36:51.834
So, you are standing at the gates.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.711
Heaven and hell.

36:53.794 --> 36:56.881
As we all know,
it's very difficult to get to heaven.

36:56.964 --> 36:57.924
Very small door.

36:58.007 --> 37:00.051
But if you make it through, you're golden.

37:00.134 --> 37:02.845
You'll be gifted
a final reward of the hole-in-one.

37:03.346 --> 37:09.018
More likely, you'll be going through hell,
where you'll tackle all seven sins.

37:09.101 --> 37:12.563
You wanted a challenge, Dr. O?
Challenge is here.

37:12.647 --> 37:14.273
The first sin is greed.

37:14.357 --> 37:18.569
We go through, chipping over
the lazy river that is sloth,

37:18.653 --> 37:21.530
into the Red-Light District
representing lust,

37:21.614 --> 37:26.202
into the Hall of Mirrors for vanity,
and down the Envy Eyes,

37:26.285 --> 37:29.080
gluttony, and then wrath is the final.

37:29.163 --> 37:31.540
Just like at the end
of a golf course in putt-putt,

37:31.624 --> 37:34.043
the ball goes in, it doesn't come out.
That's the end.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.170
Step up to the tee box, Dr. O.

37:36.254 --> 37:38.881
He knows how much kinetic energy
to give for that height.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.424
Of course I do.

37:42.426 --> 37:43.511
[all exclaiming]

37:43.594 --> 37:46.847
[Sara] So close.
If you wanna hit it like that, you can.

37:46.931 --> 37:48.349
-Are you ready?
-[Sara] Sure.

37:48.432 --> 37:49.308
Hit.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.228
There you go.

37:52.311 --> 37:56.274
There you go! All right.
He's in the land of greed right now.

37:56.983 --> 37:58.150
[all cheering]

37:59.735 --> 38:02.863
-Check!
-Knowing Dr. O, he's avoided vanity.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.199
All right.

38:06.534 --> 38:09.996
-That was an accident. That's two.
-Stopped it there. Cheeky stop of it.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.749
[all laughing]

38:13.833 --> 38:16.043
This is supposed to be the easy part.
Yeah. Oh!

38:16.127 --> 38:17.128
Uh-oh.

38:17.211 --> 38:19.130
-This is it.
-[Sara] There you go!

38:19.213 --> 38:21.090
[all] Yay!

38:21.173 --> 38:22.508
Hole-in-twelve!

38:23.676 --> 38:25.553
Rodolfo, Sara. Thank you so much.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.931
Green Team,
would you slice up some cake for us?

38:29.849 --> 38:32.518
[upbeat music playing]

38:36.605 --> 38:39.066
Joey, Mario, bring us your cake.

38:40.568 --> 38:43.904
[Joey] I provided to you today
a light ladyfinger cake

38:43.988 --> 38:46.907
with a vanilla Chantilly cream
and raspberries.

38:46.991 --> 38:51.454
The ladyfingers are really light
and the cream adds a lot of nice flavor.

38:51.537 --> 38:53.789
For me, it's a little bit dry.

38:54.915 --> 38:58.336
The assembly. It feels
a little bit like an afterthought.

38:58.419 --> 39:02.465
I feel like you spent a lot of time
creating a really fun course,

39:02.548 --> 39:05.301
and then, at some point you thought,
"Oh, we need to add cake,"

39:05.384 --> 39:07.678
and then you put this in the carousel.

39:08.262 --> 39:11.766
I really liked the look of your course.
I think it's very fun.

39:11.849 --> 39:16.562
Loved all those detailed edible elements,
but I could see the mechanisms.

39:17.104 --> 39:21.317
Would've liked to see more of the bridge,
and less of the exposed mechanism.

39:21.400 --> 39:26.655
I love that things moved on your course.
I liked the eyes on the gingerbread man.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.450
I loved the moving carousel cake.
It was a lot of fun.

39:29.533 --> 39:32.203
The wooden border?
I'm like, "Why did they do that?"

39:32.286 --> 39:34.246
Couldn't they have put an edible border?

39:34.330 --> 39:37.208
These aren't normal courses.
They're bakineered courses.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.919
So I would've preferred
that you had bakineered something.

39:40.002 --> 39:44.298
Also, the unicorn itself
should have been engineered in a way

39:44.382 --> 39:48.302
that the ball could actually make it
through the obstacle. Yours got stuck.

39:48.386 --> 39:50.471
Joey, Mario, thank you very much.

39:50.554 --> 39:53.140
Up next, Brandi and Menuka.

39:53.974 --> 39:56.185
[Brandi] I made a fresh lemon cake

39:56.268 --> 39:57.978
with a lemon-curd filling

39:58.062 --> 40:00.231
and cream cheese buttercream.

40:00.314 --> 40:02.942
The cake is beautifully done.

40:03.526 --> 40:07.988
The layer of lemon curd adds
a really nice brightness to the cake.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.033
The cream cheese buttercream is a nice,
creamy contrast.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.828
I do feel like the cakes
that we have gotten from you

40:13.911 --> 40:17.998
have been similar.
I love that you have a voice in pastry,

40:18.082 --> 40:22.503
but I would also love to see
you show off other elements of your voice.

40:22.586 --> 40:25.714
Mini-golf holes are meant to be fun,
and you gave us a fun moment

40:25.798 --> 40:27.508
when we saw our ball change color.

40:27.591 --> 40:30.636
-[Joanne] Wait a minute!
-Your ball turned from purple to green!

40:31.512 --> 40:34.765
I think you've hit the spirit
of this challenge on the head with that.

40:34.849 --> 40:35.683
Thank you.

40:35.766 --> 40:38.227
One thing that I think
could have been improved is,

40:38.310 --> 40:41.856
although you told Joanne
that she had to go through the tunnel,

40:41.939 --> 40:44.984
she really did not have to go
through the tunnel, right?

40:45.067 --> 40:47.695
-It was an option to go around the tunnel.
-Yes.

40:47.778 --> 40:52.324
And I think that's not the best design
for your particular course,

40:52.408 --> 40:54.702
'cause you have
that wonderful magic trick.

40:55.703 --> 40:57.455
And, finally, Rodolfo, Sara.

40:58.622 --> 41:01.834
I did a brute chocolate powder cake.

41:02.376 --> 41:05.963
So, I added a little sour cream
to bring a little moisture for the cake.

41:06.046 --> 41:08.632
And then I did a coconut fudge

41:09.175 --> 41:11.051
and a coconut pastry cream.

41:11.135 --> 41:13.387
Rodolfo, you have baked us, I think,

41:13.471 --> 41:16.599
the richest, darkest…

41:16.682 --> 41:17.516
Sure. [chuckles]

41:17.600 --> 41:22.062
…deepest chocolate cake
that we have had during this competition.

41:22.146 --> 41:25.274
It's a lot to eat. I don't know
if I could continue eating it.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.358
It is that rich.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.651
Rodolfo and Sara,

41:27.735 --> 41:30.905
speaking as
the world's greatest mini-golf player

41:30.988 --> 41:32.615
in the history of humanity,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.951
I'd have to say
that your course is well-engineered.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.287
I love that there was
a heaven and hell path.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.624
I wish that there were
some moving mechanical elements,

41:41.707 --> 41:43.417
like you have in a mini-golf course,

41:43.501 --> 41:48.005
but there were so many individual things
that I absolutely just enjoyed looking at.

41:48.088 --> 41:50.633
And overall very clever and creative.

41:51.926 --> 41:54.637
Rodolfo, Sara, thank you very much.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.055
-Well done.
-Thank you, guys.

41:56.639 --> 41:57.681
Good game. Good game.

42:01.060 --> 42:03.270
-Well, judges, that was fun.
-Mmm. That was fun.

42:03.354 --> 42:05.314
You've got a lot
to discuss and deliberate.

42:05.397 --> 42:07.983
I'll let you guys chat.
I'm gonna go hang with the teams.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.194
[tense music playing]

42:12.112 --> 42:13.155
[Andrew] Joanne, Dr. O,

42:13.781 --> 42:16.575
we split our teams of bakineers
into two larger teams,

42:16.659 --> 42:18.744
the Yellow Team and the Green Team.

42:19.245 --> 42:20.704
One of those teams is gonna win,

42:20.788 --> 42:23.123
and we're going to pick a winner
from that team

42:23.207 --> 42:25.543
who's gonna get a big advantage
in the next mission.

42:25.626 --> 42:28.045
Sadly, on the other team,
we're gonna be sending

42:28.128 --> 42:30.089
a duo of bakineers home today.

42:32.925 --> 42:35.970
So, I'm worried,
because of Sara and Rodolfo's immunity,

42:36.053 --> 42:40.140
I know that
if our team isn't the top course,

42:40.224 --> 42:42.560
we're in the bottom two no matter what.

42:43.727 --> 42:46.981
I'm feeling really confident
going into this elimination,

42:47.064 --> 42:51.068
and I hope the judges appreciate
all of the little details we put into it.

42:51.151 --> 42:53.487
I think, as a whole, our team looks great.

42:54.154 --> 42:57.032
Ultimately, do we know
who failed this mission?

42:57.866 --> 42:58.867
-Yes.
-Yeah.

42:58.951 --> 42:59.785
Okay.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.121
-You guys have a decision?
-Yes, we do.

43:02.663 --> 43:04.248
[dramatic music playing]

43:07.001 --> 43:10.921
One bakineer duo will win today's mission
and earn a big boost for the next one.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.924
And, sadly, from the losing course,

43:14.008 --> 43:16.510
one pair will have faced
their final mission today.

43:21.932 --> 43:24.768
Cindy and Taylor, Steve and Renee,

43:26.020 --> 43:27.062
Randi and Jacob.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.779
Your course today was really cohesive.

43:35.863 --> 43:38.324
There was a clear theme
running throughout.

43:38.407 --> 43:42.620
You all worked together really well,
and that showed in your bakineered course.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.540
Now that leaves the Green Course,

43:47.082 --> 43:49.585
also known as the Sweet Cycle.

43:50.127 --> 43:51.086
Joey, Mario.

43:52.588 --> 43:53.797
Brandi, Menuka.

43:54.798 --> 43:56.216
Rodolfo and Sara.

43:58.844 --> 44:03.057
I'm sorry to say the judges did not think
your course was as successful.

44:04.516 --> 44:07.436
Which sadly means
that one of you bakineering teams

44:07.519 --> 44:09.188
will be going home today.

44:10.189 --> 44:13.901
Rodolfo and Sara,
you earned immunity from the last mission,

44:13.984 --> 44:16.528
so that does mean
it's either Joey and Mario,

44:17.863 --> 44:20.866
or Brandi and Menuka
who will be going home today.

44:22.451 --> 44:24.995
It was a really tough decision
for us today.

44:26.163 --> 44:30.292
The team going home today is…

44:36.131 --> 44:37.091
Joey and Mario,

44:37.174 --> 44:39.885
I'm very sorry to say
today was your final mission.

44:40.636 --> 44:44.431
I loved how fun your course was,
and particularly your edible bridge,

44:44.515 --> 44:48.519
but I think the level of finish did differ
in different parts of the course today.

44:49.395 --> 44:52.731
Well, I love how you've shown us
how you can improve with each mission.

44:52.815 --> 44:55.275
And your design work was much improved,

44:55.359 --> 44:57.778
but there were still elements
that were unpolished.

45:00.114 --> 45:03.200
You're all so amazingly talented.
It's been my pleasure to know you.

45:03.283 --> 45:06.704
We may be going home,
but we're going back as different people.

45:07.287 --> 45:08.872
Give it up for Joey and Mario.

45:08.956 --> 45:11.458
[Joey] Leaving here a better chef
than when I walked in.

45:11.542 --> 45:12.835
I feel like brothers now.

45:12.918 --> 45:15.587
I always had my guard up,
and it was funny to understand

45:15.671 --> 45:18.799
that someone can get to know me so quickly
only because he wanted to.

45:18.882 --> 45:21.009
Working with Joey's
been a great experience.

45:21.093 --> 45:22.511
You're a lovely person.

45:23.303 --> 45:25.305
[emotional music playing]

45:30.769 --> 45:32.354
[Andrew] On to the big moment.

45:32.438 --> 45:35.691
-The winning team today is--
-Is--

45:35.774 --> 45:38.986
Is going to be revealed

45:39.069 --> 45:41.780
by my golf skills…

45:41.864 --> 45:42.865
[softly] Here we go again.

45:42.948 --> 45:43.866
[Justin] …yet again.

45:44.366 --> 45:47.453
How fun is this? I actually have a--

45:48.537 --> 45:51.165
A purple ball for Cindy and Taylor.

45:51.248 --> 45:53.751
I've got a pink ball for Randi and Jacob.

45:54.251 --> 45:57.713
And a orange ball for Steve and Renee.

45:58.255 --> 46:01.216
So, what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna putt the ball

46:01.300 --> 46:04.219
that corresponds to the winning team
at the winning team,

46:04.303 --> 46:05.929
and that is how you'll know

46:06.722 --> 46:09.975
that you're the winning team.
I've been practicing for this.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.061
[dramatic music playing]

46:15.481 --> 46:17.024
[Justin] Hmm.

46:17.691 --> 46:18.817
Let's see.

46:21.612 --> 46:22.696
Hold on.

46:23.405 --> 46:24.782
[all laughing]

46:24.865 --> 46:25.824
[Randi] Oh, my goodness.

46:26.617 --> 46:27.868
This sucks.

46:34.082 --> 46:36.251
Congratulations, Steve and Renee.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.171
I'm dancing.

46:39.254 --> 46:41.882
Yes, this is good.

46:41.965 --> 46:43.550
[Renee] It's just like, "Oh!"

46:43.634 --> 46:46.386
We redeemed ourselves, and we're excited.

46:46.470 --> 46:47.763
We're gonna rock this,

46:47.846 --> 46:50.224
and I'm just feeling amazing
at this point.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.850
Congratulations.

46:51.934 --> 46:55.229
Each one of the judges scored you guys
with a pass in this mission,

46:55.312 --> 46:58.398
which means you'll get
a very big boost in the next mission.

46:58.482 --> 47:01.819
And you'll find out more
about that very soon.

47:02.611 --> 47:03.737
[Steve exhales]

47:03.821 --> 47:04.947
Now, bakineers,

47:05.030 --> 47:08.367
normally I would start
the next mission right now,

47:08.450 --> 47:10.160
but I don't know.

47:10.702 --> 47:14.206
Sometimes, it's kind of nice
to be fashionably late.

47:14.289 --> 47:15.916
[doors opening]

47:17.501 --> 47:18.627
[Taylor] Oh, my God.

47:22.297 --> 47:23.298
[jazz music playing]

47:23.882 --> 47:26.093
[Justin] Who are those mysterious people?

47:26.176 --> 47:27.094
[Randi] Oh, my God.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.762
[Justin] And more importantly,

47:28.846 --> 47:32.266
how are those people
going to impact your future

47:32.349 --> 47:33.767
in this competition?

47:34.768 --> 47:38.397
Bakineers, you'll find out soon enough.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.773
[Taylor] No way.

47:40.274 --> 47:42.067
-Are we gonna have dancers?
-[Renee] Ah!

47:45.487 --> 47:46.405
I'm gonna die.

47:52.202 --> 47:54.162
