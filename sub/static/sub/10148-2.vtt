WEBVTT

01:15.785 --> 01:17.620
- You're cheating.
- Am not.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.121
You have to be cheating.

01:19.205 --> 01:20.807
There's no way you could know
something like that

01:20.831 --> 01:21.958
without a calculator.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.084
People used to.

01:23.167 --> 01:26.837
You're saying you memorized
the multiplication tables? What for?

01:26.921 --> 01:28.339
My dad was a scientist.

01:28.631 --> 01:30.108
Guess he wanted me
to be ready for anything.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.634
Fifteen times fifteen.

01:31.717 --> 01:33.928
- Two-twenty-five.
- Jackie?

01:34.220 --> 01:35.680
Jackie?

01:36.555 --> 01:37.556
Oh, sorry.

01:37.640 --> 01:38.808
What were you saying?

01:39.642 --> 01:40.977
You've got the calculator.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.938
- Punch it in.
- I wasn't listening.

01:44.230 --> 01:45.940
Yep, for a change.

01:46.148 --> 01:47.525
Something wrong, Jackie?

01:48.150 --> 01:49.151
I think...

01:49.235 --> 01:50.945
I think somebody's been following me.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.239
Following you? Who?

01:53.322 --> 01:54.448
I don't know.

01:54.782 --> 01:58.577
But I get this feeling sometimes
that I'm being watched.

01:58.661 --> 02:00.705
Yesterday, it happened in the backyard.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.832
Today, it was on the soccer field.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.209
But when I look around, no one's there.

02:07.503 --> 02:08.503
Jackie?

02:08.671 --> 02:11.966
Sorry to interrupt the homework, but
I'm trying to work on my expansion plans

02:12.049 --> 02:13.342
and I can't concentrate.

02:13.426 --> 02:14.844
We're being as quiet as we can.

02:14.927 --> 02:16.387
That's why I can't concentrate.

02:16.470 --> 02:17.990
I get nervous when kids are too quiet.

02:22.852 --> 02:25.438
And maybe we'll even
bang some pots and pans together.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.106
Anything to help you concentrate.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.357
I knew I could count on you.

02:28.941 --> 02:29.984
Anytime, Bill.

02:30.443 --> 02:32.194
"Bill"? That's What you call him?

02:32.403 --> 02:34.238
- That's his name.
- You know what I mean.

02:34.322 --> 02:35.323
Oh.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.158
Well, it's kind of a long story.

02:37.241 --> 02:38.701
- Terry?
- Somebody's out there.

02:38.784 --> 02:39.784
Where?

02:41.537 --> 02:42.580
Terry!

02:48.002 --> 02:49.002
Hey.

03:06.812 --> 03:07.938
Hey!

03:47.978 --> 03:48.979
Interesting.

03:50.398 --> 03:53.025
"Interesting"? That's all you can say?
It was unbelievable.

03:53.109 --> 03:54.652
A word I rarely use.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.239
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

03:58.364 --> 04:00.991
Terry, the sample you gave me
was just soil.

04:01.283 --> 04:02.326
Plain old dirt.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.661
It was alive.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.955
All right. Supposing it was?

04:06.038 --> 04:08.118
Do you really think last night
will be the end of it?

04:14.672 --> 04:17.508
So Nelson expects me to drop everything
and go out with him tonight

04:17.591 --> 04:18.926
as if I don't have a life.

04:19.009 --> 04:20.289
What do you think I should wear?

04:20.428 --> 04:23.139
If I spent as much time studying
as I do practicing my cheers,

04:23.222 --> 04:24.932
I'd actually have an education by now.

04:27.143 --> 04:28.769
A girl's gotta have her priorities.

04:30.646 --> 04:31.646
Ladies.

04:31.772 --> 04:32.982
What are you still doing here?

04:33.232 --> 04:34.733
Oh, taking care of some things.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.610
Keeping an eye on me, you mean.

04:36.861 --> 04:38.362
You're still worried, aren't you?

04:38.446 --> 04:40.156
Who wouldn't be?

04:42.450 --> 04:44.827
Wish you'd gotten a better look
at that guy in the backyard.

04:45.035 --> 04:47.663
Yeah, his features
were kind of indistinct.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.669
You know, your dad's
a pretty important guy

04:53.752 --> 04:55.546
and he's probably got a few enemies.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.965
- I wonder if one of them...
- Bill's not my dad.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.639
- Everything okay today?
- No problems.

05:05.723 --> 05:07.523
You can give Terry and Dana
a ride, can't you?

05:07.558 --> 05:09.143
Yeah, but I need to make a stop first.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.479
There's something
you've got to see, all of you.

05:14.482 --> 05:16.108
I saw it on the way over here.

05:16.192 --> 05:18.194
- Isn't it great?
- Isn't what great?

05:18.277 --> 05:19.904
Jackie, it's real estate.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.780
This is where my new factory
is going to be.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.324
What's that?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.591
Terry!

05:44.303 --> 05:45.429
What is this stuff?

05:45.513 --> 05:46.347
Don't touch it!

05:46.514 --> 05:47.514
Don't touch it!

06:02.863 --> 06:03.863
Get outta here!

06:41.944 --> 06:43.487
{933931

07:15.561 --> 07:16.561
Ah!

07:42.212 --> 07:43.964
- Hurry!
- But Dana and Terry?

07:44.048 --> 07:45.591
They got away. Now come on.

08:05.653 --> 08:06.862
And in <i>local news,</i>

08:06.945 --> 08:09.073
<i>there was a whole lot
of shaking going on</i>

08:09.156 --> 08:10.157
<i>in Gotham tonight,</i>

08:10.240 --> 08:12.409
<i>thanks to a swarm of small earthquakes.</i>

08:12.493 --> 08:15.704
<i>Seismologists give it a 3.5
because it had a good beat</i>

08:15.788 --> 08:17.247
<i>and you could really dance to it.</i>

08:19.958 --> 08:23.212
This stuff can turn
a person's DNA inside-out.

08:23.295 --> 08:25.172
It's toxic industrial waste.

08:25.381 --> 08:27.257
<i>Probably buried several years ago.</i>

08:27.341 --> 08:28.717
<i>That's where Wallace fits in.</i>

08:28.801 --> 08:29.986
You're getting a little ahead of me.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.470
Don't you read the news?

08:31.762 --> 08:33.097
It was only ten years ago.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.264
I was seven.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.016
Oh, well.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.477
Back then, the DA accused Wallace

08:38.560 --> 08:39.978
<i>of dumping this kind of chemical.</i>

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
<i>Nothing was ever proved though.</i>

08:41.939 --> 08:43.667
What did you find out
from your friend Jackie?

08:43.691 --> 08:44.733
Not much.

08:44.817 --> 08:46.417
Only that Wallace isn't her real father.

08:46.443 --> 08:47.569
Not her father?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.364
Now, that's... Um, promising.

08:55.953 --> 08:58.038
Will you please tell me
what is going on?

08:58.122 --> 08:59.415
There's no time to explain.

08:59.498 --> 09:00.938
Now help me get your stuff together.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.603
Those... Those things that came up
out of the ground, what were they?

09:03.627 --> 09:04.795
I... I don't know.

09:04.878 --> 09:07.005
You know. Otherwise,
we wouldn't be leaving like this.

09:07.089 --> 09:08.090
It's not like you.

09:09.383 --> 09:10.383
Come on!

09:11.468 --> 09:13.178
I have a right to know.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.639
Now's not the time to...

09:17.891 --> 09:18.976
Tony?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.689
It's you, isn't it? It had to be.

09:23.772 --> 09:26.275
Tony? That was my father's name.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.651
But this can't be.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.988
Get away from here as fast as you can.

09:31.280 --> 09:32.448
- Go!
- No!

09:32.531 --> 09:34.241
I want to know what this is about.

09:34.324 --> 09:35.576
Jackie, do what I say!

09:36.952 --> 09:37.953
Tony...

09:39.329 --> 09:40.329
Please...

09:41.874 --> 09:45.085
I didn't know. I didn't know!

09:50.716 --> 09:53.010
Bill, tell me everything. Now.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.887
I... I can't.

09:54.970 --> 09:57.514
Better tell her, unless you want me to.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.268
I was just starting the company.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.103
<i>I didn't have much money.</i>

10:04.104 --> 10:06.124
<i>I couldn't afford to dispose
off my excess chemicals</i>

10:06.148 --> 10:07.188
<i>the way I was supposed to.</i>

10:08.025 --> 10:10.068
<i>I found this abandoned mine shaft.</i>

10:10.152 --> 10:11.612
I don't know about this, Bill.

10:11.695 --> 10:13.030
The shaft's totally sealed.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.364
No way for a bleed-through.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.616
What if there's a quake?

10:16.492 --> 10:17.910
Tony, listen to me.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.453
We may be cutting corners now,

10:19.536 --> 10:23.540
but someday this company's
gonna be very, very big.

10:24.208 --> 10:25.448
Don't you want a share of that?

10:25.834 --> 10:26.877
You talkin' partnership?

10:27.169 --> 10:28.169
Lam.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.088
Think of Jackie.

10:30.589 --> 10:32.299
No mother, just you.

10:32.508 --> 10:34.468
You want the best for her, don't you?

10:37.805 --> 10:41.225
Looks like I'm gonna need
a rope, partner.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.979
<i>It didn't take us long to get
most of the barrels into the shaft,</i>

10:46.063 --> 10:48.315
<i>but then, there was a problem.</i>

10:48.524 --> 10:51.109
Lower! Lower! Come on!

10:55.948 --> 10:57.241
It's snagged!

10:57.366 --> 10:58.659
Give it a tug!

11:02.204 --> 11:03.330
Again.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.022
<i>He had to be dead.</i>

11:30.524 --> 11:31.859
That's what we figured anyway.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.735
Why didn't you ever tell me about this?

11:34.027 --> 11:36.667
You were too young, and besides,
it wouldn't have brought him back.

11:36.697 --> 11:39.199
- But he is back, isn't he?
- What do you mean?

11:39.283 --> 11:41.743
That chemical they were dumping
had catalyzing properties.

11:42.119 --> 11:44.663
It can scramble DNA
with other organic material.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.123
Like the Earth itself.

11:46.248 --> 11:47.958
{933931

11:51.003 --> 11:52.838
He's after me. I'm sorry.

11:54.548 --> 11:55.548
Wait!

14:10.726 --> 14:11.810
I'm at the entrance.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.105
<i>Good,
keep your directional mics open.</i>

14:15.355 --> 14:16.475
<i>You might pick up something.</i>

14:16.857 --> 14:18.057
All right. I'll keep 'em open.

14:18.400 --> 14:19.400
Where do I start?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.945
Well, we've got a rough idea
of where the house is,

14:22.029 --> 14:24.841
and we know the underground rivers can
take you almost anywhere in the city.

14:24.865 --> 14:26.158
<i>That's the good news.</i>

14:26.241 --> 14:28.493
- And <i>the bad</i> news?
<i>- Everything else.</i>

15:24.966 --> 15:26.176
You can't be.

15:27.177 --> 15:28.512
You just can't be.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.597
But you are, aren't you?

15:31.515 --> 15:33.683
You're him. You're my father.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.394
Yes... Jackie.

15:37.938 --> 15:39.648
And this is what the accident
did to you?

15:40.023 --> 15:41.358
Not accident!

15:43.902 --> 15:45.821
Not accident!

15:47.197 --> 15:48.323
But Bill said that...

15:57.791 --> 15:59.626
Bill!

16:01.044 --> 16:02.379
Oh, my God.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.926
- Tony?
- You left me buried!

16:09.094 --> 16:10.345
I thought you were dead.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.890
No! Didn't want partner!

16:14.266 --> 16:17.060
That's not true, there was nothing
I could do for you, nothing!

16:17.686 --> 16:18.687
But there was Jackie.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.856
I took care of her
like she was my own daughter.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.459
Isn't that what you would have wanted?

16:22.524 --> 16:25.152
You stole her!

16:25.652 --> 16:27.571
You wanna kill me? Go ahead.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.907
I got a lot to answer for.
But for God's sakes, let Jackie go.

16:31.116 --> 16:35.495
She stays and you die.

16:36.705 --> 16:37.831
No!

16:45.088 --> 16:46.882
Let him go!

16:51.887 --> 16:53.889
You heard her. Let him go!

17:01.563 --> 17:03.440
Don't make me repeat myself.

17:34.971 --> 17:36.473
Come on!

19:18.158 --> 19:19.993
There's no way out now!

19:27.876 --> 19:28.876
Try another one!

19:29.210 --> 19:30.628
Sorry. AII out.

19:31.087 --> 19:32.839
Jackie...

20:12.962 --> 20:14.214
My father...

20:15.507 --> 20:17.550
He's not your father. Not really.

20:18.343 --> 20:20.303
He's... a ghost.

20:22.555 --> 20:23.555
Dad.
