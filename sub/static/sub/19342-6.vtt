23:51.417 --> 23:52.959
Absolutely.

23:56.250 --> 23:57.583
We need to get past
this stalemate.

24:00.542 --> 24:01.625
I agree.

24:04.959 --> 24:09.083
You have to believe
that I need you as a partner.

on something.

24:23.959 --> 24:26.291
Okay.

24:26.291 --> 24:31.166
So, uh, you know we had
a bit of a rough quarter.

24:31.166 --> 24:33.625
Everyone was
a little rocked by it.

24:33.625 --> 24:37.333

that they're having trouble

24:37.333 --> 24:38.083

24:38.083 --> 24:41.458
And... so...

24:41.458 --> 24:45.792
I was thinking
of bringing --

24:45.792 --> 24:47.708
bringing
Wendy Rhoades back.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.708
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:54.208 --> 24:55.458
I thought this was
about you apologizing.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.542
Now this?
I know. I know.

24:57.542 --> 24:59.959
But the guys
have made it clear,

24:59.959 --> 25:02.792

and their words,

25:02.792 --> 25:04.458
that they need her.

25:04.458 --> 25:06.458
I thought
you had a new man.

25:06.458 --> 25:08.625
Wags convinced me
to try him out,

25:08.625 --> 25:10.834
but Wags was pretty fucked up
at the time.

25:13.166 --> 25:14.542
You're not thinking
about bringing Wendy back.

25:14.542 --> 25:16.625
It's a done deal,

25:18.375 --> 25:20.708
You're actually

Closer than ever
to your goal, Bryan.

51:22.417 --> 51:23.667
Which one?

51:23.667 --> 51:27.291
That's what you should spend
the next few weeks figuring out.

51:33.542 --> 51:34.041
See you next week.

51:34.041 --> 51:35.708
Namaste.

51:37.291 --> 51:38.291
Hey.

51:38.291 --> 51:38.875
Hey.

51:38.875 --> 51:40.667
I heard about Boyd.

51:40.667 --> 51:42.959
I know, brutal.

51:42.959 --> 51:45.333
But forget that.
This is more important.

51:45.333 --> 51:46.458
I-I'm sorry.

51:47.750 --> 51:49.333
I should have told you
about Wendy

51:49.333 --> 51:51.458
before I even
spoke to her.

51:51.458 --> 51:54.125
You think
this is about her?

51:54.125 --> 51:57.542
Bobby, you act like
we're in this together.

51:57.542 --> 52:00.291
You make command decisions,
sometimes life-changing,

52:00.291 --> 52:04.583
and you don't even
run them by me first.

52:04.583 --> 52:07.125
Do you remember the boat?
The Galápagos?

52:07.125 --> 52:09.667
You make plans,
you put them in motion,

52:09.667 --> 52:12.375
and then you inform me
after the fact.

52:12.375 --> 52:14.667
That is not the marriage
that I signed up for,

52:14.667 --> 52:18.750
and that is not one that
I will accept going forward.

52:18.750 --> 52:20.583
I've risked alienating
my brothers and sisters.

52:20.583 --> 52:25.208
I have walked away from things
that I care deeply about.

52:25.208 --> 52:26.667
I know.

52:26.667 --> 52:28.750
And I do it
because I understand

52:28.750 --> 52:30.834
that when something
becomes a liability,

52:30.834 --> 52:34.417
you cut it loose
for the greater good.

52:34.417 --> 52:36.500
And if you ask me,
Wendy Rhoades is a liability,

52:36.500 --> 52:40.542
and I will never  be okay
with the two of you talking.

52:40.542 --> 52:42.959
Okay.

52:42.959 --> 52:44.834
You're right.

54:15.375 --> 54:18.375
Son, there were times when
I thought you were finished.

54:18.375 --> 54:20.041
You scared the hell
out of me, more than once.

54:20.041 --> 54:22.834
But you prevailed.

54:25.458 --> 54:29.583

Gracie or the Governor's?

Relax, Dad.

54:34.083 --> 54:35.583

for the time being.

Words you never want to hear

You're gonna want to hear this.
It is very good.

54:52.208 --> 54:55.000
On my way over here, I got
a call from Axelrod's lawyer.

54:55.000 --> 54:57.250
They are not gonna
be deposing you next week.

54:57.250 --> 54:58.291
They're not gonna
be deposing you at all.

54:58.291 --> 55:01.083
But their case
can't proceed unless --

55:03.792 --> 55:06.000
Their case
isn't proceeding.

55:06.000 --> 55:07.458
They are dropping
the lawsuits...

55:07.458 --> 55:10.417
quietly, over the next
couple of months.

55:10.417 --> 55:13.500
What did I tell you?
You have muscle.

55:13.500 --> 55:15.834
You even scared Axelrod.

55:18.291 --> 55:19.458
When did this happen?

55:19.458 --> 55:21.375
I got the call
on the way over.

55:21.375 --> 55:23.875
Your father's right.
You must've scared him.

55:23.875 --> 55:24.667
What's the problem?

55:24.667 --> 55:28.000
Now you're
truly unencumbered.

55:28.000 --> 55:31.458
Axelrod isn't scared
by displays of strength.

55:31.458 --> 55:32.625
You all right?

55:32.625 --> 55:34.000
I'm not sure.

55:36.041 --> 55:38.500
Uh...

55:38.500 --> 55:40.333
Thank you
for this tribute.

55:40.333 --> 55:41.667
