WEBVTT

00:04.354 --> 00:06.764
Is your husband still off climbing?

00:06.765 --> 00:08.365
Yes. Another few weeks.

00:08.366 --> 00:10.663
You take care of the
kids, you pay the bills,

00:10.664 --> 00:13.406
you have the full-time job,
and he's, what, off in Nepal.

00:31.711 --> 00:33.812
You took these photos?

00:33.813 --> 00:35.814
I did.

00:35.815 --> 00:40.152
And did our Vatican
guests know you took them?

00:40.153 --> 00:41.486
No.

00:43.323 --> 00:45.023
And what do they mean?

00:45.024 --> 00:48.427
This is a map of evil.

00:48.428 --> 00:50.062
These are sigils,

00:50.063 --> 00:52.965
um, occult symbols representing

00:52.966 --> 00:55.434
a demonic hierarchy on Earth.

00:55.435 --> 00:57.002
And what do you want with it?

00:57.003 --> 01:01.199
You and I talked about evil
becoming more organized, um,

01:01.200 --> 01:03.802
using technology, social media.

01:03.803 --> 01:06.371
- The 60?
- Right.

01:06.372 --> 01:09.307
There are 60 sigils here.

01:09.308 --> 01:11.176
Some of them we've already encountered.

01:11.177 --> 01:12.577
Leland Townsend,

01:12.578 --> 01:14.412
Dwight Ferrell, the murderer

01:14.413 --> 01:15.880
of the three children.

01:15.881 --> 01:18.350
And the others?

01:19.652 --> 01:21.753
That's why we've come to you.

01:21.754 --> 01:24.322
We want to find the rest.

01:25.658 --> 01:28.493
Does your psychological
adviser agree with all this?

01:30.062 --> 01:32.530
Look, when you talk about demonic evil,

01:32.531 --> 01:33.932
I'm out of my depth,

01:33.933 --> 01:36.727
but psychopaths seem to
be aware of this document

01:36.728 --> 01:38.236
and organizing around it.

01:38.237 --> 01:40.839
These symbols seem to inspire them.

01:43.542 --> 01:45.176
All right.

01:45.177 --> 01:48.646
I'm going to approve some
limited focus on this.

01:49.982 --> 01:52.517
Which of these symbols
are you looking at next?

01:52.518 --> 01:54.719
Uh...

01:54.720 --> 01:56.888
This sigil

01:56.889 --> 01:58.790
was used in some recent paintings.

01:58.791 --> 02:01.059
The artist is local.

02:01.060 --> 02:02.894
I was going to talk to him.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.533
Good. Who is it?

02:13.706 --> 02:15.373
Your father?

02:16.809 --> 02:17.909
I'll wait outside.

02:17.910 --> 02:20.245
No. I'm fine with you going,

02:20.246 --> 02:22.080
but I want Kristen to go with you.

02:22.081 --> 02:24.482
- That's all right, I'll just wait in the car.
- I don't need her to go with me.

02:24.483 --> 02:25.750
David, Kristen, you are both going.

02:25.751 --> 02:27.085
Now...

02:28.220 --> 02:30.455
One question:

02:30.456 --> 02:34.826
if he is one of the 60,
what's your plan?

02:50.276 --> 02:52.444
So what is our plan?

02:52.445 --> 02:55.013
No idea.

02:55.014 --> 02:58.349
I'll stay out of your way.
You talk to your dad.

02:58.350 --> 03:02.353
So I can find out whether he's
sold his soul to the devil?

03:02.354 --> 03:06.157
No, he probably just
saw the symbol somewhere.

03:06.158 --> 03:10.361
Just to warn you, my dad
can be... a bit of a bastard.

03:10.362 --> 03:13.298
When's the last time you saw him?

03:13.299 --> 03:16.301
Five years ago.

03:17.670 --> 03:20.538
Oh. It's d'Artagnan.

03:20.539 --> 03:23.475
So are you officially abandoning us

03:23.476 --> 03:25.543
for reality TV?

03:25.544 --> 03:27.612
Yeah. That's right, I
found my new calling.

03:27.613 --> 03:29.380
Let's try it again.

03:29.381 --> 03:32.510
Okay. Uh, look, it looks like
this is gonna take forever,

03:32.511 --> 03:34.619
so I'm probably not gonna
be able to meet you guys.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.288
That's all right. We're heading upstate.

03:37.289 --> 03:39.357
Is your friend there?

03:39.358 --> 03:41.893
No, luckily.

03:41.894 --> 03:43.461
Do you know what you'd say to her?

03:43.462 --> 03:44.863
No.

03:44.864 --> 03:48.633
Probably just, "Nice
seeing you. Goodbye".

03:48.634 --> 03:50.135
Oh, you should call her again.

03:50.136 --> 03:52.904
No, three times is enough.

03:54.073 --> 03:56.040
Oh, okay. I-I got to go.

03:56.041 --> 03:58.710
You guys, uh, try not to
get into too much trouble,

03:58.711 --> 04:01.412
and don't kill any demons without me.

04:01.413 --> 04:03.014
All right. Promise.

04:04.350 --> 04:06.017
So who's the friend?

04:06.018 --> 04:09.920
Oh, it's just an actress from
the reality TV show he was on,

04:09.921 --> 04:10.922
Vanessa.

04:10.923 --> 04:13.558
She gave him her number, and
he called her three times,

04:13.559 --> 04:15.527
but she never called back.

04:15.528 --> 04:16.728
Ouch.

04:16.728 --> 04:19.664
Everything we do,
he'll check and recheck

04:19.665 --> 04:21.266
because we don't run from the truth.

04:21.267 --> 04:24.035
Yeah, I'm skeptical because this show

04:24.036 --> 04:25.436
will need to convince me

04:25.437 --> 04:27.572
that there are ghosts and demons.

04:27.573 --> 04:29.607
You got to do it in sync with your lips.

04:29.608 --> 04:31.075
Yeah, but that's not what I said.

04:31.076 --> 04:33.077
We had to trim for length.

04:33.078 --> 04:36.080
That's not shorter, that's stupider.

04:36.081 --> 04:39.517
I said something about your
show being a piece of crap.

04:39.518 --> 04:42.086
Look, we're trying to
create a story arc here,

04:42.087 --> 04:44.055
and we need to start
with you as dismissive

04:44.056 --> 04:45.256
of ghosts, not the show.

04:45.257 --> 04:47.258
All right? Let's try it one more time.

04:47.259 --> 04:48.526
We don't want to be here all night.

04:48.527 --> 04:50.261
Yeah, I don't want to be
here all night, either,

04:50.262 --> 04:51.462
but this is a lie.

04:51.463 --> 04:54.465
It's TV. Doesn't have
to be exactly true.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.304
Hey.

04:59.305 --> 05:01.206
Look, let's try it again, okay?

05:03.475 --> 05:06.311
Everything we do,
he'll check and recheck

05:06.312 --> 05:08.246
because we don't run from the truth.

05:08.247 --> 05:11.449
Yup, I'm skeptical because

05:11.450 --> 05:14.052
this show will need to convince me

05:14.053 --> 05:16.754
that there are ghosts and demons.

05:16.755 --> 05:17.989
You sound pissed.

05:17.990 --> 05:20.558
Let's try it again, not so angry.

05:20.559 --> 05:23.094
Sure. Why not?

05:38.811 --> 05:41.646
God, it's so great here.

05:41.647 --> 05:44.616
Not another house for ten miles.

05:44.617 --> 05:47.018
It's like the start of a horror movie.

05:47.019 --> 05:49.587
Oh, well, bad cell phone coverage.

05:49.588 --> 05:50.955
Guess all we need is car trouble,

05:50.956 --> 05:52.490
and we'll have won horror movie bingo.

05:52.491 --> 05:54.125
Son!

05:55.628 --> 05:57.929
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so.

05:57.930 --> 06:00.298
My son has returned.

06:00.299 --> 06:02.533
Dad. Hey.

06:02.534 --> 06:04.435
Um, this is Kristen.

06:04.436 --> 06:05.970
- Kristen, hello.
- Hi.

06:05.971 --> 06:07.472
Welcome to The Gully.

06:10.976 --> 06:13.378
I want to paint a T-shirt for you.

06:13.379 --> 06:16.447
Something... red.

06:17.716 --> 06:19.717
Listen, we're having
a party. Come on in.

06:19.718 --> 06:21.552
I want you to stay the
night, introduce you

06:21.553 --> 06:23.054
- to some people.
- We have to get back.

06:23.055 --> 06:24.555
Oh, no, you don't.

06:24.556 --> 06:25.857
Humor your old man, okay?

06:25.858 --> 06:27.558
I want you to meet my wife.

06:27.559 --> 06:29.727
You got... you got married?

06:29.728 --> 06:31.396
Yeah. Few years back.

06:31.397 --> 06:33.064
You know how much I love marriage.

06:33.065 --> 06:35.166
Tell me,

06:35.167 --> 06:38.202
are you convincing my son
to not become a priest?

06:38.203 --> 06:39.404
- Dad.
- Oh.

06:39.405 --> 06:41.498
I'll tell you right now: I want my seed

06:41.499 --> 06:42.840
spread far and wide.

06:42.841 --> 06:44.509
Is he talking about his seed again?

06:44.510 --> 06:47.178
Hey, I'm in my 60s.
What else am I gonna do?

06:47.179 --> 06:50.708
This is Esther, the new Mrs. Acosta.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.484
Ah, it's so great to finally meet you.

06:53.485 --> 06:55.653
I want to hug you, but I'm still drying.

06:55.654 --> 06:57.155
Drying?

06:57.156 --> 06:59.324
Wow. Did you make that?

06:59.325 --> 07:01.659
Yeah. I usually do it on other people,

07:01.660 --> 07:04.829
but I decided to make
myself the canvas for once.

07:04.830 --> 07:06.331
How far along, Dad?

07:06.332 --> 07:07.899
Six months.

07:09.001 --> 07:11.269
You always wanted a brother.

07:11.270 --> 07:13.004
David Acosta.

07:13.005 --> 07:14.939
You are welcome.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.507
And this is Cori.

07:16.508 --> 07:18.400
Someone's got to keep
your father in line.

07:18.401 --> 07:19.744
Why not a priest?

07:19.745 --> 07:22.880
I love what Pope Francis
said about global warming.

07:22.881 --> 07:24.182
This is David's girlfriend, Kristen.

07:24.183 --> 07:26.451
- Ah!
- Oh, I'm actually just a friend...

07:26.452 --> 07:27.919
Cori's my other wife.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.220
- Your... ?
- A throuple.

07:29.221 --> 07:31.222
Or, if we were Mormons,

07:31.223 --> 07:33.191
a marriage.

07:34.693 --> 07:35.960
Come. Come inside.

07:35.961 --> 07:37.428
I could use a hand with the punch.

07:37.429 --> 07:39.364
You have to stay for the Root Ceremony.

07:39.365 --> 07:42.300
- Yes.
- We're calling on the ancestors.

07:42.301 --> 07:44.068
Everybody just suddenly
started bleeding.

07:44.069 --> 07:45.970
Dougie is bleeding.

07:45.971 --> 07:49.207
Oh, my God. What is going on?

07:49.208 --> 07:51.209
Seriously?

07:51.210 --> 07:52.810
Yeah, that was good.

07:54.213 --> 07:55.480
Makes me look like an idiot.

07:55.481 --> 07:56.781
It helps with the story.

07:56.782 --> 07:58.483
Anyway, that's the last one.

07:58.484 --> 07:59.917
- We're done.
- Good.

07:59.918 --> 08:02.153
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:02.154 --> 08:03.988
How have you been?

08:03.989 --> 08:05.623
Good. How about you?

08:05.624 --> 08:06.791
- Fine.
- Good.

08:06.792 --> 08:09.227
Okay. Well, see you.

08:11.463 --> 08:13.364
Hey, Ben.

08:13.365 --> 08:14.766
Yeah.

08:14.767 --> 08:16.901
I'm not sure what happened.

08:16.902 --> 08:19.170
What do you mean?

08:19.171 --> 08:20.972
Just so you know, one month is too long.

08:32.683 --> 08:34.852
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What?

08:34.852 --> 08:36.988
You said one month is too long.

08:36.989 --> 08:39.056
- What does that mean?
- Tony, can you turn off the internal mic?

08:39.057 --> 08:41.292
I thought we connected.

08:41.293 --> 08:42.590
That's why I gave you my number.

08:42.591 --> 08:44.620
Yeah, that is why
I called it three times.

08:44.621 --> 08:46.822
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did. Called it the next day.

08:46.823 --> 08:48.081
I called it the week after.

08:48.082 --> 08:49.189
- I called it the week after.
- Then who were you calling?

08:49.190 --> 08:51.035
- 'Cause you weren't calling me.
- Okay, I get it.

08:51.036 --> 08:52.804
You're an actress, and...

08:52.805 --> 08:54.796
this whole thing is a performance,

08:54.797 --> 08:56.589
- and, uh...
- I wrote my number on your hand.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.509
- And I called it.
- I didn't get it.

08:58.510 --> 08:59.677
We got to get to work here.

08:59.678 --> 09:01.078
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

09:01.079 --> 09:02.713
Show me the number you were calling.

09:04.249 --> 09:06.517
There. That is the number
you wrote on my hand.

09:06.518 --> 09:09.253
That's not my number. Those
numbers are transposed.

09:09.254 --> 09:11.422
That is the number that
you wrote on my hand.

09:12.825 --> 09:14.826
This was a bad beginning.

09:14.827 --> 09:16.861
This is what I suggest:
just give me an hour

09:16.862 --> 09:18.529
to finish this ADR, and then...

09:18.530 --> 09:20.264
we should talk.

09:20.265 --> 09:21.999
Okay? Please?

09:28.040 --> 09:29.340
Glad you're here.

09:29.341 --> 09:30.908
So, a baby, huh?

09:30.909 --> 09:33.578
Yeah, but you'll always be my firstborn.

09:33.579 --> 09:36.180
Bouncing baby boy with the fat cheeks.

09:38.884 --> 09:41.352
Hey, don't be jealous, now.

09:41.353 --> 09:43.354
Congratulate me.

09:45.224 --> 09:47.859
Congratulations.

09:50.796 --> 09:52.763
What's this, Dad?

09:54.800 --> 09:56.601
New painting.

09:56.602 --> 09:58.803
Not quite sure what it is yet.

09:59.872 --> 10:02.966
No, this. This symbol.

10:02.967 --> 10:04.475
I don't know. You like it?

10:04.476 --> 10:06.911
Seen it in your books, too.

10:06.912 --> 10:09.280
I didn't know you had my books.

10:09.281 --> 10:11.282
This some Catholic thing?

10:11.283 --> 10:13.885
I'm just trying to
understand your process.

10:13.886 --> 10:16.153
Look, I know we, uh...

10:16.154 --> 10:18.422
hit that fork in the road.

10:18.423 --> 10:20.224
You danced off towards religion.

10:20.225 --> 10:22.326
I got swallowed up with art.

10:22.327 --> 10:24.095
What you feel when you pray

10:24.096 --> 10:25.997
or get a whiff of that incense,

10:25.998 --> 10:29.066
I feel right here, with color.

10:29.067 --> 10:33.304
The way Saint John of the
Cross talks about mysticism,

10:33.305 --> 10:35.907
that's how I feel about painting.

10:35.908 --> 10:38.609
Someone... paints through me.

10:38.610 --> 10:40.978
My hand is divinely guided.

10:42.180 --> 10:43.614
By who?

10:43.615 --> 10:46.117
I don't know. Spirit, perfect muse.

10:46.118 --> 10:48.586
All I know is, when
I'm painting, it's crap,

10:48.587 --> 10:51.255
but when somebody else
paints through me...

10:52.991 --> 10:55.126
... that's when it all comes together.

10:55.127 --> 10:57.795
How do you know it's not some...

10:57.796 --> 10:59.363
bad spirit...

10:59.364 --> 11:01.365
painting through you?

11:01.366 --> 11:03.367
Now you're talking like a priest.

11:03.368 --> 11:05.770
There's no good or bad in art.

11:05.771 --> 11:08.439
The more years you
put on you, you'll see.

11:08.440 --> 11:12.310
Duality doesn't exist;
there's just what is.

11:12.311 --> 11:15.271
This symbol, it didn't
appear in your paintings

11:15.272 --> 11:17.181
until three years ago.

11:17.182 --> 11:19.350
What happened three years ago?

11:19.351 --> 11:21.485
I don't know.

11:21.486 --> 11:23.554
I met Esther and Cori.

11:23.555 --> 11:25.957
They brought new life to me.

11:28.860 --> 11:30.861
So, how does a throuple work?

11:31.897 --> 11:33.898
With great delicacy.

11:33.899 --> 11:36.621
Um, Tuesdays and
Thursdays are ladies only.

11:36.622 --> 11:39.403
And the rest of the time
it's first come, first served.

11:39.404 --> 11:41.238
Nobody ever gets jealous?

11:41.239 --> 11:42.473
Well...

11:42.474 --> 11:45.242
maybe sometimes.

11:45.243 --> 11:47.545
But we're looking for
a third, if you want.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.201
I'm sorry, I'm feeling

11:51.202 --> 11:52.984
- a little light-headed.
- Sangria.

11:52.985 --> 11:56.153
When it's good, it's really good.

11:56.154 --> 11:58.073
Did you put something in it?

11:58.074 --> 12:00.491
Love. A lot of love.

12:00.492 --> 12:02.093
$750 an ounce

12:02.094 --> 12:04.729
- of hallucinogenic love.
- Mm...

12:07.766 --> 12:09.700
What's that?

12:09.701 --> 12:11.068
Oh, it's my pottery.

12:11.069 --> 12:12.703
Do you like it?

12:12.704 --> 12:14.372
What's that symbol?

12:14.373 --> 12:17.174
I don't know. Something I saw and liked.

12:17.175 --> 12:19.010
Why? You don't like it?

12:20.412 --> 12:22.880
I saw the same thing
in Leon's paintings.

12:22.881 --> 12:26.050
Yeah. He takes it from Esther's pottery.

12:26.051 --> 12:28.686
The power of symbols.

I'm home!

13:00.352 --> 13:02.353
Anybody home?

13:36.055 --> 13:37.689
Kristen?

13:47.543 --> 13:49.468
- Oh...
- Oh.

13:49.469 --> 13:50.694
Hey. Hey.

13:50.695 --> 13:53.320
- Hi. Yeah. Yep. Okay, yeah.
- Sheryl. Yep. See you inside.

13:53.321 --> 13:54.421
Yeah. See you in there.

13:57.577 --> 13:59.377
Just please stop hanging
out with my friends.

13:59.378 --> 14:01.045
It's not my fault they like me.

14:01.046 --> 14:03.214
No, I didn't. And also,
mind your own business

14:03.215 --> 14:05.316
and be quiet.

14:10.788 --> 14:12.323
Too much beard?

14:12.324 --> 14:14.592
Daddy!

14:14.593 --> 14:16.894
- Oh-ho-ho, my God, come to me!
- Dad, you're finally home!

14:16.895 --> 14:18.763
- Oh, I am home!
- Okay, Mommy didn't tell us.

14:18.764 --> 14:20.198
I know. I was gonna surprise you.

14:20.199 --> 14:21.766
Why I didn't tell Mom. Where is Mom?

14:21.767 --> 14:23.425
At work.

14:23.426 --> 14:25.792
Lynn-bo, come here, babe.

14:25.793 --> 14:27.818
Come here. Come here.

14:29.747 --> 14:32.401
Mm. I know I've been gone a while.

14:32.402 --> 14:33.636
Did you miss me?

14:33.637 --> 14:34.637
At least a little bit?

14:34.638 --> 14:36.697
You've never been gone this long before.

14:36.698 --> 14:38.022
- But I'm here now.
- Dad...

14:38.023 --> 14:39.809
- We missed you so much.
- Was it hard, climbing... ?

14:39.810 --> 14:41.277
- It was a little hard.
- Do you still have all your toesies?

14:41.278 --> 14:43.112
- I have three toes left.
- Are they presents for us?

14:43.113 --> 14:44.981
Yes, they are. From the snows of Tibet.

14:46.383 --> 14:48.275
You can open one each. One each.

14:48.276 --> 14:49.619
Whoo-hoo!

14:49.620 --> 14:50.744
Yeah!

14:50.745 --> 14:52.088
I call this one!

14:52.089 --> 14:54.257
- How cool!
- Look at this...

14:54.258 --> 14:55.925

15:19.616 --> 15:20.816
Yes.

15:20.817 --> 15:22.585
How many cups?

15:22.586 --> 15:23.986
Two.

15:23.987 --> 15:25.488
Why?

15:26.757 --> 15:29.125
We're gonna take an Uber back.

15:29.126 --> 15:31.460
It's spiked with psilocybin.

15:32.696 --> 15:33.996
Damn.

15:33.997 --> 15:36.625
What did he say about the sigil?

15:36.626 --> 15:39.602
He said he had no idea what it means.

15:39.603 --> 15:42.338
He said he just started painting it.

15:42.339 --> 15:44.373
Do you believe him?

15:44.374 --> 15:45.869
No.

15:45.870 --> 15:48.944
He told me this was just sangria, too.

15:48.945 --> 15:52.548
Esther said the sigil came from her.

15:55.908 --> 15:59.455
She introduced my dad
to the Root Ceremony.

15:59.456 --> 16:01.545
It's a weekly séance

16:01.546 --> 16:04.548
to conjure up the ghosts
of their ancestors.

16:05.740 --> 16:08.041
I think we should keep an eye on her.

16:14.015 --> 16:15.648
There are no cameras.

16:15.649 --> 16:17.384
No one's filming this.

16:17.385 --> 16:19.252
Okay, your team did that.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.655
Don't be scared, Ben. I'm with you.

16:22.656 --> 16:24.915
Vanessa, are you messing with me?

16:24.916 --> 16:26.511
What was that, Tony?

16:26.512 --> 16:27.994
I was just clarifying a line.

16:27.995 --> 16:29.262
I didn't say that.

16:29.263 --> 16:30.263
You could have.

16:30.264 --> 16:31.498
But I didn't.

16:31.499 --> 16:33.099
Yeah, but why does my voice sound weird?

16:33.100 --> 16:36.283
Oh, come on! Tony,

16:36.284 --> 16:37.871
we talked about this.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.622
- What?
- You're pitching

16:39.623 --> 16:42.242
Ben's voice up an octave
to make him sound wimpy.

16:42.243 --> 16:44.778
No, I'm not. I'm separating
the voice from the background.

16:44.779 --> 16:46.746
Which you always do when
it's a person of color.

16:46.747 --> 16:48.214
- You're giving Ben the scaredy-cat edit...
- Vanessa,

16:48.215 --> 16:50.845
- I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
- Oh, then pretend this.

16:50.846 --> 16:52.866
What the hell?

16:52.867 --> 16:55.855
There goes my ADR. There goes Ben's.

16:55.856 --> 16:57.590
That's eight hours of work.

16:57.591 --> 16:59.459
You are replaceable, Vanessa!

16:59.460 --> 17:02.061
Then replace me. And let's
see what HR says about it.

17:05.199 --> 17:07.434
Want to come over?

17:07.435 --> 17:08.734
Sure.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.645
Our ancestors are here.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.748
Their ghosts are among us.

17:21.749 --> 17:26.051
Let us lift up their spirits
under those most high.

17:26.053 --> 17:27.587
We honor our fallen,

17:27.588 --> 17:29.389
remember our lost,

17:29.390 --> 17:33.259
and open ourselves up to their guidance.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.729
Let us call up their names to power!

17:39.934 --> 17:42.001
Call upon their names.

17:42.002 --> 17:43.303
Speak on their power.

17:43.304 --> 17:46.806
Join us here on this divine day!

17:46.807 --> 17:48.641
To walk among us!

17:48.642 --> 17:53.313
No fear in our hearts
in this divine hour.

17:53.314 --> 17:55.181
To walk among us!

17:55.182 --> 17:57.150
Our divine guides!

17:57.151 --> 17:58.852
We honor you!

17:58.853 --> 18:01.788
Our divine guides!

18:01.789 --> 18:02.956
We honor you!

18:02.957 --> 18:05.682
We keep time now for the many who can't.

18:05.683 --> 18:09.796
As you feel the spirit
of peace rise within you,

18:09.797 --> 18:11.030
join me now.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.300
With our hands!

18:14.301 --> 18:15.702
We honor you!

18:15.703 --> 18:17.337
And with our feet!

18:17.338 --> 18:19.772
We honor you!

18:21.509 --> 18:22.642
My turn, my turn, me next!

18:22.643 --> 18:23.843
My turn, my turn, my turn!

18:23.844 --> 18:25.378
Okay, wait.

18:25.379 --> 18:27.360
Wait, wait, wait. I
got to call your mom.

18:27.361 --> 18:29.262
- I thought she'd be home by now.
- Can we talk?

18:29.263 --> 18:30.448
Sure. Nothing more

18:30.449 --> 18:32.385
till I get back, okay?

18:32.386 --> 18:34.154
No, no, not without me.

18:40.394 --> 18:43.292
So, how fast are you
planning to leave this time?

18:43.293 --> 18:45.798
- Who's your new boyfriend, Sheryl?
- That's none of your business.

18:45.799 --> 18:48.469
I don't know, you know?
When we, uh, clean the sheets

18:48.470 --> 18:50.703
- out there, it's gonna be someone's business.
- Okay.

18:50.704 --> 18:52.238
This is what I need from you.

18:52.239 --> 18:53.706
Oh, you need something from me?

18:53.707 --> 18:55.208
Yeah, I don't want Kristen to know

18:55.209 --> 18:57.343
that I was back there. Getting laid.

18:59.480 --> 19:01.881
- Of course, that Andy charm.
- Yeah.

19:01.882 --> 19:03.983
The frat boy way of
looking at the world.

19:03.984 --> 19:05.685
Sorry, didn't you
need something, Sheryl?

19:05.686 --> 19:08.986
Uh, yeah, yeah, I just...
would rather Kristen not know

19:08.987 --> 19:11.524
- that I was back there with my boyfriend.
- Why not?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.159
Because...

19:13.160 --> 19:15.328
- I don't think she likes him.
- Why?

19:15.329 --> 19:17.997
Because she would rather I was single.

19:17.998 --> 19:20.033
Okay. So you want me to keep it secret?

19:20.034 --> 19:21.234
Exactly.

19:21.235 --> 19:23.269
Okay.

19:23.270 --> 19:25.572
So why is Lynn upset with me?

19:27.241 --> 19:28.975
Oh, my God.

19:30.507 --> 19:31.932
Why do you think, Andy?

19:31.933 --> 19:33.324
You've been away for three months,

19:33.325 --> 19:35.048
and your wife has had
to deal with a lot:

19:35.049 --> 19:36.950
losing her job, getting a new one,

19:36.951 --> 19:39.519
and Laura's heart possibly
stopping at any minute.

19:39.520 --> 19:40.853
That's why I came home early.

19:40.854 --> 19:42.889
What a prince you are.

19:42.890 --> 19:44.757
Yeah, thanks.

19:44.758 --> 19:46.632
- So?
- So,

19:46.633 --> 19:48.543
uh, yes, sure, I'll keep your secret.

19:48.544 --> 19:51.097
I think it's probably good
you're getting laid now and then.

19:51.098 --> 19:53.266
If only to remove the stick up your ass.

19:53.267 --> 19:55.141
Always such a joy to talk to you, Andy.

19:55.142 --> 19:57.169
- Isn't it, though?
- Yeah. Who you calling?

19:57.170 --> 19:59.105
Kristen. But I think her cell's off.

19:59.106 --> 20:00.740
Okay, remember: shh.

20:00.741 --> 20:01.941
Yeah.

20:09.083 --> 20:12.952
I haven't been high in 15 years.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.375
Then?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.980
My sister.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.748
She gave you the wrong number.

21:56.749 --> 21:59.918
She didn't want us to be together.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.823
We were alone.

My sister's grafted to my body.

Here.

22:20.840 --> 22:24.009
Kind of like a phantom limb.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.181
My sister died when we were little,

22:29.182 --> 22:31.817
and she's been attached
to me ever since.

22:31.818 --> 22:33.485
To my side.

22:33.486 --> 22:37.022
She's, uh, very protective.

22:42.095 --> 22:44.263

Hello?

Are you all right?

25:27.593 --> 25:28.960
Esther?

25:35.535 --> 25:37.026
Oh, my God.

25:37.027 --> 25:38.837
I got you. I got you. You're all right.

25:38.838 --> 25:41.640
Just breathe.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.668
Help!

25:43.669 --> 25:45.861
We need help out here!

25:48.846 --> 25:51.483

Just breathe...

25:53.986 --> 25:56.521
Help!

26:00.293 --> 26:01.793
It's coming.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.695
Coming.

26:12.472 --> 26:15.207
Is she okay?

26:36.028 --> 26:38.029
- Hello, little one.
- Esther,

26:38.030 --> 26:40.031
uh, you should, uh...

26:40.032 --> 26:43.242
Let's go. You-you-you need a doctor.

26:43.243 --> 26:46.271
Welcome to the world,
little one. Welcome.

26:46.272 --> 26:47.539
I should get back.

26:47.540 --> 26:49.174
Something's really...

26:49.175 --> 26:50.675
just not right here.

26:50.676 --> 26:52.878
Do you want to hold her?

27:02.021 --> 27:04.222
- Spit. And wipe your mouth.
- Do we really have to...

27:04.223 --> 27:05.891
- go to school tomorrow?
- Don't do it on the bedsheet.

27:05.892 --> 27:07.792
Yes, of course you have to go to school.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.261
Here we go, here we go.

27:09.262 --> 27:11.062
- Up into bed, monsters.
- I think there's a holiday.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.131
- No, there's no holiday tomorrow.
- Yes, there is. It's called Daddy's Day.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.133
Okay, yeah, Daddy's Day
means you go to school.

27:15.134 --> 27:16.192
- That's what Daddy's...
- No.

27:16.193 --> 27:17.702
- What is this?
- We need to spend time with you, Dad.

27:17.703 --> 27:19.237
I thought we'd outgrown the bedwetting.

27:19.238 --> 27:20.972
It's in case he comes back.

27:20.973 --> 27:22.140
He who?

27:22.141 --> 27:23.975
The monster in my bed.

27:23.976 --> 27:25.877
- Oh, what?
- He's in Mom's dreams, too.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.712
I've heard her call him George.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.481
Mommy showed us he's fake,

27:29.482 --> 27:31.483
but it's just in case
he ever comes back.

27:31.484 --> 27:32.984
- Not coming back.
- Oh, that's nothing.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.252
Just wait until we tell
you about Halloween.

27:34.253 --> 27:35.587
Like, there was this girl with a mask,

27:35.588 --> 27:37.446
and we almost buried Laura alive.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.057
- Oh, yeah. You should've been there.
- What?

27:39.058 --> 27:40.258
She, like, buried me

27:40.259 --> 27:41.760
in this big hole, and it was so...

27:41.761 --> 27:43.428
- What?
- Oh, my gosh. We should play the game.

27:43.429 --> 27:45.430
You have to play! You have to
play! You have to play, Dad!

27:45.431 --> 27:47.799
You don't have to play
the game. Ben will play.

27:47.800 --> 27:50.068
- Ben? Who's Ben?
- Oh, yeah.

27:50.069 --> 27:51.636
Ben the Magnificent. He's awesome.

27:51.637 --> 27:53.138
He comes here, like, all the time.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.106
He's so, so funny...

27:55.107 --> 27:56.975
He's really nice. And
he's really funny, too.

27:56.976 --> 27:58.143
Ben's around a lot.

27:58.144 --> 28:00.579
He fixes things. For Mom.

28:00.580 --> 28:01.869
He'll fix the game, too,

28:01.870 --> 28:03.181
- next time he's here.
- Yeah.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.850
- So what is this game?
- Oh, we have to go back

28:05.851 --> 28:07.452
into the game and say goodbye,

28:07.453 --> 28:10.422
or else the monsters will never leave.

28:11.457 --> 28:13.124
And where is this game?

28:13.125 --> 28:14.793
In Mom's closet.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.528
Um, it's an A.R. game.

28:16.529 --> 28:18.296
We got it taken away.

28:18.297 --> 28:20.966
- Yeah.
- Okay. So we just need to go in there and, what,

28:20.967 --> 28:22.968
- beat the monsters?
- Yeah.

28:22.969 --> 28:26.605
Well, what say we do it,
Bouchard family-style?

28:26.606 --> 28:27.806
- Yes! Let's do it!
- Okay!

28:27.807 --> 28:30.008
Lynn-bo, what do you think? Up to you.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.676
You want to come help?

28:33.279 --> 28:35.013
Okay!

28:35.014 --> 28:37.816
- Yes! Let's go, let's go.
- We're doing it. Come on.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.652
Annie?

28:52.798 --> 28:55.033
Annie?

28:58.521 --> 29:00.847
Annie, is that you?

29:03.142 --> 29:05.377
David.

29:05.378 --> 29:07.045
You escaping already?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.381
No, not yet.

29:10.416 --> 29:12.183
What are you doing?

29:12.184 --> 29:13.685
Uh, new painting.

29:13.686 --> 29:14.986
What do you think?

29:16.989 --> 29:18.490
I like it.

29:18.491 --> 29:21.526
It's not so...

29:21.527 --> 29:22.727
severe.

29:24.163 --> 29:26.564
I must have been in a good mood.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.833
Who's Annie?

29:28.834 --> 29:32.381
Uh, some friend of yours from the party.

29:32.382 --> 29:34.105
Said she was heading out here.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.241
Annie who?

29:37.276 --> 29:38.543
Commerce.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.448
Annie Commerce?

29:44.450 --> 29:45.784
Yes.

29:45.785 --> 29:46.785
What?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.054
She was in the party?

29:49.055 --> 29:51.556
Yeah. Why?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.625
What did she look like?

29:53.626 --> 29:55.960
Mid-20s.

29:55.961 --> 29:56.961
Black.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.396
About this tall.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.732
Did she have scars?

30:00.733 --> 30:02.967
Yeah.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.137
Don't tell me you're getting
ready to marry her, too.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.640
You saw one.

30:08.641 --> 30:10.075
What?

30:10.076 --> 30:11.776
An ancestor.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.311
What do you mean?

30:13.312 --> 30:16.314
Annie is part of our family.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.250
Died in 1859.

30:19.251 --> 30:22.420
She was given the last name of
the ship she was transported on.

30:22.421 --> 30:24.255
Commerce.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.258
She was enslaved.

30:32.363 --> 30:36.198
"June the seventh, 1836..

30:36.199 --> 30:39.101
On this day I received of Thomas Isner,

30:39.102 --> 30:42.872
the sum of $275, for the
purchase of a Negro woman

30:42.873 --> 30:44.773
named Annie

30:44.774 --> 30:46.609
from the ship Commerce.

30:46.610 --> 30:49.445
23 years of age and four months.

30:49.446 --> 30:52.615
Dark eyes. Sturdy and well-made.

30:52.616 --> 30:54.583
Given of my hand and seal.

30:54.584 --> 30:55.985
John Bertens".

30:59.890 --> 31:01.924
I don't believe this.

31:01.925 --> 31:04.894
There are records of her damages.

31:04.895 --> 31:08.063
The whipping of her
arms for not letting go

31:08.064 --> 31:10.065
of the baby being
snatched away from her.

31:10.066 --> 31:13.384
In 1850,

31:13.385 --> 31:15.437
some Harvard doctor went down south

31:15.438 --> 31:17.172
to photograph slaves.

31:18.861 --> 31:22.230
This is Annie Commerce.

31:25.448 --> 31:27.483
Is that the woman you saw?

31:27.484 --> 31:31.820
I... I don't know, I...

31:38.847 --> 31:40.248
This... ?

31:41.706 --> 31:43.032
The slave-owner's brand.

31:43.033 --> 31:45.267
You use this in your paintings.

31:45.268 --> 31:46.302
Yeah.

31:48.138 --> 31:49.772
You said this was intuitive.

31:49.773 --> 31:50.839
I lied.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.776
Why?

31:53.777 --> 31:56.979
Because I birthed you and I
knew exactly what you'd say.

31:56.980 --> 31:59.848
But that seal... is mine.

31:59.849 --> 32:02.484
It's the seal of a racist
who owned human beings.

32:02.485 --> 32:06.355
It's evil.

32:06.356 --> 32:09.692
It's not... It's not you that's evil.

32:09.693 --> 32:13.395
It's... It's about slavery.

32:15.165 --> 32:20.035
Dad, this symbol is nothing but pain.

32:20.036 --> 32:22.571
That's right.

32:22.572 --> 32:24.873
There's pain in my paintings.

32:24.874 --> 32:26.742
And in my DNA.

32:26.743 --> 32:29.211
And in yours. And in Annie's.

32:29.212 --> 32:31.380
But that's not all that I am.

32:31.381 --> 32:33.382
And not all you are.

32:33.383 --> 32:34.984
What I know

32:34.985 --> 32:39.254
is that I'm in charge of
how I shoulder that weight.

32:39.255 --> 32:43.225
So I reached out and reclaimed
that brand for myself.

32:43.226 --> 32:46.662
Made it my property,
not the other way around.

32:46.663 --> 32:51.100
To me, that's a symbol of resilience.

32:51.101 --> 32:53.102
Of grace.

32:53.103 --> 32:54.670
Beyond all measure.

32:57.107 --> 32:59.375
That's just not what I
see when I look at that.

32:59.376 --> 33:01.243
I leave you that room.

33:01.244 --> 33:02.711
You leave me mine.

33:02.712 --> 33:05.214
You carry your weight the
way you need to carry it,

33:05.215 --> 33:08.884
and I'll carry mine my way.

33:08.885 --> 33:12.755
But what's true... is
we're both gonna carry it.

33:22.766 --> 33:24.433
I missed you, Dad.

33:24.434 --> 33:26.702
I know.

33:26.703 --> 33:29.271
I missed you, too.

33:29.272 --> 33:30.973
Look, is this really that big of a deal?

33:30.974 --> 33:32.274
I just don't know what
to make of you believing

33:32.275 --> 33:34.710
that your sister is... there.

33:34.711 --> 33:36.245
You just seem so sane.

33:36.246 --> 33:37.713
- Thanks a lot.
- No, come on. I mean,

33:37.714 --> 33:39.048
what do you want me to do with this?

33:39.049 --> 33:41.483
All beliefs look weird from the outside.

33:41.484 --> 33:44.553
You believe in quantum entanglement?

33:44.554 --> 33:46.212
Yes, because it's proven.

33:46.213 --> 33:47.589
You have two different particles

33:47.590 --> 33:49.476
in two totally different locations,

33:49.477 --> 33:52.294
and they impact each
other instantaneously,

33:52.295 --> 33:54.430
at 10,000 times the speed of light.

33:54.431 --> 33:55.998
How is that possible?

33:55.999 --> 33:57.399
Wait a minute. Are
you seriously comparing

33:57.400 --> 33:59.696
quantum entanglement to you believing

33:59.697 --> 34:01.670
that your dead sister is
grafted to your left side?

34:01.671 --> 34:02.738
My right side.

34:02.739 --> 34:05.607
Wow! Wow.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.943
Okay. Shall we call it a night?

34:17.353 --> 34:18.987
Okay. Uh, look.

34:18.987 --> 34:20.956
Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry.

34:22.292 --> 34:25.094
You believe it, and...

34:26.795 --> 34:28.797
... it's wrong for me to judge it.

34:31.434 --> 34:32.768
You're not just saying that?

34:36.940 --> 34:39.041
I'm not.

34:55.992 --> 34:57.526
What's wrong?

34:57.527 --> 34:59.661
Nothing.

35:03.399 --> 35:06.168
I-I, uh... I, uh...

35:06.169 --> 35:09.138
I got to go to the, uh, bathroom.

35:18.181 --> 35:19.982
What does it matter?

35:19.983 --> 35:21.316
Huh? What's the big deal?

35:21.317 --> 35:22.518
She's just a little nuts.

35:22.519 --> 35:24.486
What's wrong with that?

35:24.487 --> 35:27.422
Right? You don't have to
argue about everything.

35:30.193 --> 35:32.394
Come on.

35:32.395 --> 35:34.663
It's fine.

35:48.878 --> 35:50.546
Hello.

35:50.547 --> 35:52.681
Who is this?

35:52.682 --> 35:54.183
Hey, it's Ben.

35:54.184 --> 35:55.517
Um, I-I, uh...

35:55.518 --> 35:57.352
The caller ID said "God".

35:57.353 --> 35:59.588
Oh, yes. Um, sorry.

35:59.589 --> 36:02.191
I, uh, I changed my name in your phone.

36:02.192 --> 36:04.860
Anyway, listen. I,
I'm-I'm here with a, um,

36:04.861 --> 36:07.029
well... with-with a woman.

36:07.030 --> 36:09.097
The friend that Kristen
was talking about?

36:09.098 --> 36:12.367
Yeah. She believes that

36:12.368 --> 36:15.270
a invisible woman

36:15.271 --> 36:18.740
is grafted to the side of her body.

36:20.543 --> 36:23.111
Right? Insane.

36:24.914 --> 36:29.084
Okay, but I really like her,
so, I mean, what do I do?

36:29.085 --> 36:30.485
Ben,

36:30.486 --> 36:35.123
I just saw a woman
who was dead 160 years.

36:35.124 --> 36:37.092
O-Okay.

36:37.093 --> 36:38.560
So, what?

36:38.561 --> 36:42.497
What, just... just ignore the weirdness?

36:42.498 --> 36:45.434
The world is weird.

36:47.948 --> 36:50.322
- You'll have to show me what to do.
- Okay.

36:50.323 --> 36:52.150
- Okay.
- Don't get scared, but look up there.

36:52.151 --> 36:53.783
Whoa! Come on.

36:53.784 --> 36:55.251
I know. You'll get used to it.

36:55.252 --> 36:56.932
Go in Mom's room,
you might find something.

36:58.856 --> 37:00.190
Show him the creepy girl.

37:05.563 --> 37:07.385
- Okay, Dad, watch out.
- Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

37:07.386 --> 37:09.005
Watch it, watch it.

37:12.036 --> 37:13.536
Now I see why your mom hid this stuff.

37:13.537 --> 37:15.305
You girls played this all by yourselves?

37:15.306 --> 37:17.407
Yeah, and almost beat it,
too, before it just got weird.

37:17.408 --> 37:18.541
How much weirder can it get?

37:18.542 --> 37:20.076
- Oh, you have no idea.
- A lot weirder.

37:20.077 --> 37:21.277
- Just wait for it.
- Oh, great.

37:21.278 --> 37:23.580
- Dad, through here.
- Okay.

37:23.581 --> 37:25.048
- Through here?
- Mm-hmm.

37:25.049 --> 37:28.018
All right. Okay.

37:29.053 --> 37:30.387
Oh, come on!

37:30.388 --> 37:31.755
That's scary.

37:31.756 --> 37:33.790
- Use a fireball! Fireball!
- Okay. H-How do I... how... ?

37:33.791 --> 37:35.932
Okay, you make a circular
motion with your hand, like this.

37:35.933 --> 37:37.550
- Yeah.
- And then, then throw it out.

37:37.551 --> 37:39.229
- Like... that?
- Mm-hmm.

37:39.230 --> 37:41.097
Dad, hurry. He's coming, Dad, hurry.

37:41.098 --> 37:43.418
- It's not working. It's not working.
- It's coming closer!

37:44.668 --> 37:47.303
Oh, you know what? I need,
like, a cool catchphrase.

37:47.304 --> 37:48.908
- Dad, kill it!
- Hey, long legs.

37:48.909 --> 37:50.473
How do you like your steak?

37:54.011 --> 37:55.345
Well done.

37:55.346 --> 37:57.280
That was the worst catchphrase ever.

37:57.281 --> 37:58.515
I think I did it.

37:58.516 --> 38:01.117
- I think I did it, it was pretty cool.
- There it is, Dad, there.

38:03.788 --> 38:05.789
Okay, let's go.

38:09.193 --> 38:11.127
What are you doing?

38:11.128 --> 38:12.128
Who is she?

38:12.129 --> 38:14.097
Rose390.

38:14.098 --> 38:15.698
She opened it up for us.

38:15.699 --> 38:17.100
Well, then, we need to close it.

38:17.101 --> 38:19.769
You have to leave it open.

38:19.770 --> 38:21.304
Oh, really? Why is that?

38:21.305 --> 38:24.340
'Cause you won't be able
to win if you close it.

38:24.341 --> 38:26.276
Okay. Then I guess we just won't win.

38:27.311 --> 38:29.346
Stop!

38:30.948 --> 38:32.115
Dad, she's dangerous.

38:32.116 --> 38:33.850
You know what? I think we can take her.

38:33.851 --> 38:35.185
Come up at me.

38:39.623 --> 38:41.357
- Dad?
- It's okay. Here. Here, here, here.

38:41.358 --> 38:42.692
Here we go.

38:46.797 --> 38:49.966
Don't you dare!

38:49.967 --> 38:52.335
We are daring. Let's go.

39:00.811 --> 39:02.479
- Just right here, Dad, okay.
- Yeah, yeah?

39:02.480 --> 39:03.480
- Huh?
- Okay.

39:03.481 --> 39:04.681
Okay, just...

39:09.253 --> 39:10.981
- Just "goodbye".
- Goodbye?

39:10.982 --> 39:12.650
Uh-huh, just goodbye.

39:16.660 --> 39:18.561
What now?

39:18.562 --> 39:19.863
I don't know.

39:19.864 --> 39:21.097
Good job, kiddo.

39:21.098 --> 39:22.717
Group hug!

39:22.718 --> 39:25.702
- Oh, Daddy, I knew you could do it.
- There you go.

39:25.703 --> 39:28.571
- I missed you.
- Oh, God, I missed you, too.

39:28.572 --> 39:31.941
Mmm.

39:33.277 --> 39:36.613
So I'm guessing we
don't tell the monsignor

39:36.614 --> 39:38.615
about the sangria.

39:39.984 --> 39:41.584
I could entertain him with the story

39:41.585 --> 39:44.487
about how I helped a woman
give birth to a ghoul.

39:50.628 --> 39:53.229
That sangria was dangerous.

40:15.119 --> 40:16.619
This is you.

40:16.620 --> 40:18.154
Already?

40:18.155 --> 40:19.789
Already.

40:31.302 --> 40:32.869
Bye.

40:35.134 --> 40:36.725
Oh. Your sweatshirt.

40:36.726 --> 40:38.107
Oh, keep it.

40:38.108 --> 40:40.643
I don't want you to catch
a cold on the walk home.

40:40.644 --> 40:43.313
All five steps?

40:45.316 --> 40:47.550
Mm-hmm?

40:47.551 --> 40:51.054
- Good night.
- Good night.

41:02.032 --> 41:03.666
Hey, stranger.

41:10.874 --> 41:12.475
Andy.
