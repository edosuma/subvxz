WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.133
Due to play rehearsals,

00:08.216 --> 00:12.095
today's peer tutoring session will be
moved from the gym to the digital arts.

00:13.806 --> 00:17.309
Hey, I just have revisions
for scenes five, eight and ten.

00:17.392 --> 00:18.602
All of Hope's scenes.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.104
Yeah.
Just minor tweaks to fit the actress.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.648
We haven't cast that part yet.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.025
I thought Grace was gonna
read those lines today.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.027
No, it turns out that won't be necessary.

00:27.110 --> 00:30.989
-Lola read for Hope. She was amazing.
-I'll bet she was.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.326
Do you know how to get rid of
a gajillion butterflies from your stomach?

00:34.409 --> 00:35.619
Don't be nervous.
You'll be great.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.331
Lola, why don't you go wait with Rasha?

00:41.041 --> 00:42.500
Okay.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.962
-Are you hooking up with her?
-What? No!

00:45.045 --> 00:46.839
Because there's some
serious tension between you two.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.549
-I'm with Tristan.
-Who's been in a coma for three months.

00:49.633 --> 00:51.093
So there's been no boot knocking?

00:51.176 --> 00:53.303
-Okay. The guy has a right to move on.
-The guy has a boyfriend.

00:53.386 --> 00:54.387
The guy is right here.

00:54.471 --> 00:56.056
You can't break up with somebody
when they're in a coma.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.140
You can't just cheat on them, either.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.768
-Is he supposed to wait forever?
-Tristan has hung on so long.

00:59.852 --> 01:01.353
And who knows?
Maybe Miles is the reason why.

01:01.436 --> 01:05.107
Plus, I don't want a showmance
destroying this play.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.359
Let's just start the read through.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.987
I am allowed to do that
when my boyfriend's in a coma, right?

01:10.070 --> 01:11.905
When you see Lola, you'll be convinced.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.658
All right, everyone.
Start with scene one.

01:20.789 --> 01:25.460
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:27.212 --> 01:32.134
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:36.054 --> 01:41.309
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:41.393 --> 01:43.771
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

01:43.854 --> 01:47.816
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

01:58.535 --> 02:00.829
- How was the read through?

02:00.913 --> 02:02.289
You remembered that was today?

02:03.123 --> 02:06.584
Council president. I have the whole
school schedule on my phone.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.629
And I thought you were my number one fan.

02:08.712 --> 02:12.633
Well,
maybe you'd settle for lab partner?

02:13.466 --> 02:14.968
I'll get our kit.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.643
May I help you?

02:22.726 --> 02:25.270
- Switch partners with me.
- No way.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.605
Come on.
I need some face time to work my...

02:27.690 --> 02:29.107
Work my magic.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.777
Waste of time.
Rasha's gay.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.362
That's really offensive, Zoë.
Just 'cause she has short hair.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.114
I'll have you know
that I have amazing gaydar.

02:36.198 --> 02:39.326
Hmm.
If only there were an example of a lesbian

02:39.409 --> 02:42.495
who you dated for months
and thought was straight.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.540
- Oh, my God. You like her, too.

02:45.623 --> 02:47.500
Well, just switch with me,
and then I'll let you know.

02:47.584 --> 02:48.585
Well, you can't ask her.

02:48.668 --> 02:50.545
You could force her to out herself.
Not cool.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.672
Okay. Then I'll just non-creepily
creep her socials.

02:52.756 --> 02:54.299
They're all private.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.970
But if you're really that thirsty,

02:58.053 --> 02:59.512
-add her.
-Cool.

02:59.596 --> 03:00.680
You're gonna lose.

03:00.764 --> 03:02.099
Hmm.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.614
We're supposed to get
their attention by looking hot.

03:17.697 --> 03:18.782
You look like a scared deer.

03:18.866 --> 03:21.910
Well, I'm sorry, I was caught off guard
by the pants you forgot to wear.

03:21.994 --> 03:24.204
-Wait, whose attention?
-Jonah and Tiny!

03:24.287 --> 03:26.749
They need to see what they're missing
so they can apologize.

03:26.832 --> 03:27.958
Think fast.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.084
Tuna or roast beef?

03:29.918 --> 03:31.879
- You guys already made up?
- Um...

03:31.962 --> 03:33.463
Frankie. You look...

03:36.884 --> 03:38.051
Sandwich?

03:39.177 --> 03:41.304
-You still haven't heard from Jonah?
-Not all weekend.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.932
I sent him one text,
but he didn't respond, so...

03:44.016 --> 03:46.434
ball's in his court now, I think.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.273
-And the selfies are...
-To get his attention.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.609
I... I don't know what he's thinking
or what I should be thinking.

03:54.692 --> 03:55.693
What do you think?

03:55.778 --> 03:58.113
Uh... well, I think--

03:58.196 --> 04:00.115
That you're gonna come over later
and help me craft

04:00.198 --> 04:01.784
the perfect photo to get him to call?

04:03.285 --> 04:05.453
Actually,
we're playing Boggle after school.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.580
Tiny thinks he might finally beat me.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.166
Just text him and get some answers.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.293
Well, I can't double text
without seeming desperate.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.378
So a perfect selfie is my best move.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.673
And Boggle sounds great.
Does 4:00 work?

04:18.884 --> 04:20.427
Great.
Yeah, 4:00 it is.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.434
-Hey, um, we should talk.
-Okay.

04:33.816 --> 04:35.776
So, Grace and Jonah aren't fans?

04:35.859 --> 04:38.486
No, no, the part's yours. Um...

04:38.570 --> 04:41.156
but...
the other thing, uh...

04:42.115 --> 04:43.700
-We can't...
-I get it.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.993
Uh, he's your sick boyfriend.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.619
-And what we've got is--
-It's not that I don't care.

04:46.703 --> 04:49.331
That I didn't.
Or won't...

04:50.833 --> 04:53.543
I know.
But we can still talk, right?

04:53.626 --> 04:54.711
Yeah.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.213
And text?

04:57.464 --> 04:58.506
I don't see why not.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.969
Good.
I like talking to you.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.804
I like talking to you, too.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.525
Okay, uh... good talk.

05:24.532 --> 05:28.786
Friend request accepted.
Just don't like anything.

05:31.832 --> 05:34.918
- All the comments are in Arabic.
- Well, that's reasonable.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.586
What does "7bb" mean?

05:36.669 --> 05:39.547
There.
Under the pic of her and that cute girl.

05:39.631 --> 05:43.468
Uh, well, I think it means
sister or cousin...

05:43.551 --> 05:45.387
Nice try.
I'm googling.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.474
"Habibi" means "sweetheart" in Arabic.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.643
So she's into girls. Boom!

05:51.726 --> 05:55.730
Okay. Uh, then why did that guy write
"7bb" under a pic of her?

05:55.813 --> 05:57.357
I bet he's the ex.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.110
Zoë!

06:00.193 --> 06:02.862
I didn't know there was council business
scheduled for today.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.572
No. I just, um...

06:04.656 --> 06:07.742
Hey, do you know if there are
any Muslims who are gay?

06:07.825 --> 06:09.411
As student council president,

06:09.494 --> 06:11.955
I'm trying to understand the needs
of my constituency.

06:12.039 --> 06:15.542
Some things in the Qur'an
are open to interpretation...

06:15.625 --> 06:18.128
but homosexuality isn't one of them.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.214
From my understanding, it's a sin.

06:21.298 --> 06:24.968
Thank you!
That really clarifies the situation.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.137
Boom!
Now you gotta ask Rasha out for me.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.346
Why would I do that?

06:28.430 --> 06:30.933
Because you used me as a beard
for all of last year,

06:31.016 --> 06:32.642
so now you owe me till the end of time.

06:33.643 --> 06:34.769
Make sure you tell her I'm a good cook.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.477
I have... to go.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.652
How long until you can file
a missing persons report?

07:24.736 --> 07:26.196
How many seven-letter words do you have?

07:26.863 --> 07:29.157
Ugh, I've been banished
to relationship limbo.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.409
- Look.
- I can't. And four.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.079
--40 words. 150 points.

07:34.162 --> 07:35.622
-Beat that.
-You know, I will next time.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.207
I can see he's been online,

07:37.290 --> 07:39.793
so why can't he just take
0.2 seconds to click "like" on my--

07:39.876 --> 07:41.753
Oh. Oh, my God, he posted a photo.

07:42.337 --> 07:43.338
That's a mug at The Dot.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.091
Beside a tower of milk creamers?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.051
That's our thing.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.803
Seeing who can build the tallest tower.

07:50.887 --> 07:53.974
How can he do that without me
and then post it when we're not speaking?

07:54.057 --> 07:56.768
Dude's not even allowed
to drink coffee without you?

07:56.851 --> 07:57.894
You're intense.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.855
He doesn't even drink coffee
this late.

08:02.357 --> 08:03.608
Wait.

08:03.691 --> 08:06.111
If it's not his coffee,
then it is someone else's.

08:06.194 --> 08:07.737
Game over.
We are finding out.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.614
You're actually gonna let her do this?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.533
I've learned not to argue.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.455
Thank you so much
for all you've done for my son.

08:19.749 --> 08:21.293
Hey.

08:21.376 --> 08:24.462
I wish you would've been here
when it happened.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.631
-Can I see him?
-Yeah, yeah.

08:32.262 --> 08:33.305
Tris.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.392
It's Miles.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.436
Can you hear me?

08:41.854 --> 08:44.899
He knows we're here,
but he can't communicate yet.

08:46.734 --> 08:49.696
But here he is.
Looking so handsome.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.990
You do.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.619
Once we get these roots touched up.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.082
He should rest.
It's been a big day.

09:00.165 --> 09:01.416
I'll go.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.003
Take a minute.

09:17.474 --> 09:18.558
I love you.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.769
Don't ever doubt that.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.485
There.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.027
In the corner.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.904
Frankie's got no chill.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.781
Here I am
jumping to conclusions

09:33.865 --> 09:36.659
when he's just working on Miles' play.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.786
Mystery solved.
Can we go now?

09:38.870 --> 09:41.248
Well, I'm gonna go say hi.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.083
What?
We're already here.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.342
- Frankie, what are you doing here?
- You just...

09:52.425 --> 09:53.926
Tower of creamers...

09:54.010 --> 09:55.470
Frankie, you need to leave.

09:55.553 --> 09:57.889
-Now.
-Is she why you've been avoiding me?

09:57.972 --> 10:00.517
-Oh. No, no. Wait--
-Eve, you don't need to explain anything.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.851
We know each other from NA.

10:01.934 --> 10:04.854
-I just needed an emerge vent session.
-NA?

10:05.730 --> 10:07.149
It's Narcotics Anonymous.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.110
Oh.

10:10.193 --> 10:12.069
Right. Gotcha.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.157
Okay, I'm gonna leave now.

10:16.158 --> 10:18.201
- Possibly forever.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.006
Switch computer science partners with me.

10:33.049 --> 10:35.260
No way.
Tiny gets, like, a 98% percent.

10:35.343 --> 10:36.761
No offense to Rasha.

10:38.888 --> 10:40.265
I can't stay partners with her.

10:40.348 --> 10:43.143
-It's too hard. Plus, you owe me.
-Owe you what exactly?

10:44.644 --> 10:46.271
For leading me on last year,

10:46.354 --> 10:49.149
which has me continuously falling
for straight girls, thank you very much.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.319
What's really going on?

10:53.945 --> 10:57.365
Well, Goldi says Muslims can't be gay.

10:58.032 --> 10:59.409
There's a billion Muslims in the world.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.161
Do you honestly think
they're all straight?

11:01.244 --> 11:04.539
I don't know. But now Winston
wants me to ask her out for him.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.957
Hmm, why don't you just talk to her?

11:06.040 --> 11:07.334
I can't.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.502
Because you're scared of rejection.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.879
Either you grow a pair
and ask the girl you like out,

11:11.963 --> 11:15.258
or you keep switching lab partners
for the rest of your life.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.136
Sometimes I wonder,

11:19.221 --> 11:21.055
are you real?

11:21.138 --> 11:22.807
Or a figment of my imagination?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.184
I'm real.

11:25.268 --> 11:27.186
Wish I could touch you.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.402
And kiss you.

11:35.945 --> 11:36.988
Um...

11:37.071 --> 11:38.072
- Sorry. Sorry. Just stop.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.907
- What is it now, Miles?
- Everything!

11:39.991 --> 11:41.909
Look, Hope's the one
that comes on to Hero.

11:41.993 --> 11:44.454
It's not the other way around.
She seduces him.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.455
Oh, really?
Is that what happened?

11:45.538 --> 11:46.873
And if she would've
just minded her own business,

11:46.956 --> 11:48.291
Hero wouldn't have fallen
for any of her tricks.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.042
- What tricks?

11:50.126 --> 11:51.168
Maybe we can try it a different way?

11:52.587 --> 11:54.922
No. You can't just rewrite the story
whenever it suits you.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.091
Well, he is the playwright, so...

11:58.385 --> 11:59.969
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.055
I can't do this.
I have to get to the hospital.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.818
I'm so sorry about last night.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.405
So you bought me a guitar?

12:20.657 --> 12:22.575
Why didn't you tell me
you were in Narcotics Anonymous?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.286
It's not something I advertise.

12:24.369 --> 12:26.371
-Well, it hurts that you didn't tell me.
-So this is my fault?

12:26.454 --> 12:28.122
You should've told me.
I'm your girlfriend.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.707
You were the one who asked for space.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.376
-No, I didn't.
-Yes, you did.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.919
At the party, before I left.

12:35.212 --> 12:37.006
Okay, maybe, but...

12:37.089 --> 12:38.466
I didn't mean space space.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.717
I just meant space.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.470
Right. Well, I have no idea
what you're talking about. So...

12:43.680 --> 12:46.641
When you wouldn't have sex with me,
it hurt my feelings.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.937
Seems like everything I do
hurts your feelings.

12:54.357 --> 12:56.025
I care about you, Frankie.

12:57.319 --> 12:58.611
I just don't know how to prove it.

13:05.410 --> 13:06.619
Good talk.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.962
So, Winston.
Uh... what do you think?

13:16.879 --> 13:18.214
He's nice.

13:19.466 --> 13:22.009
Do you... like him?

13:23.177 --> 13:25.262
Sure.
I like lots of people.

13:26.473 --> 13:29.851
But he's not, like, you know...

13:29.934 --> 13:31.853
He's not like us, right?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.856
You mean, how he's...

13:36.107 --> 13:37.817
weird? I'm sorry.
What are you asking?

13:37.900 --> 13:41.363
Winston wanted me to ask
if you'd get coffee with him?

13:42.154 --> 13:45.241
Oh!
I'll totally get coffee with him.

13:46.701 --> 13:49.078
Awesome.
I'll, uh, let him know.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.997
So, we're done.

13:51.706 --> 13:54.459
The robot.
I can start programming.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.923
"Get well soon,
so I can make fun of you again.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.801
From Zoë."

14:11.017 --> 14:12.810
Tristan, I made a mistake.

14:15.480 --> 14:16.481
I cheated...

14:17.440 --> 14:18.483
- once...

14:20.402 --> 14:21.611
Tristan?

14:21.694 --> 14:22.862
Help! Please!

14:22.945 --> 14:25.281
Look, I think
his airway's blocked, or something.

14:27.074 --> 14:29.577
Oh. No, he's breathing.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.999
That gurgle is a sign of progress
towards speaking.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.836
Tris, are you upset?
Are you mad?

14:38.920 --> 14:41.297
Look, squeeze my hand if it's a yes.

14:42.840 --> 14:45.051
He's at square one.

14:46.052 --> 14:48.304
He doesn't understand
the world around him.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.223
No, but I need him to, um...

14:52.224 --> 14:53.810
The hard part's supposed to be over.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.978
I know.
It's a lot to digest.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.314
But the doctor...

14:59.315 --> 15:02.151
said this website
would explain everything.

15:14.080 --> 15:17.083
How long does it take
before you feel secure in a relationship?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.876
-A day, max.
-Months? A year?

15:18.960 --> 15:20.294
Helpful.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.965
Okay, real talk.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.300
I'm not a crazy girlfriend, am I?

15:29.303 --> 15:31.681
Do you really want real talk?

15:31.764 --> 15:33.182
Well, I was hoping you guys would be all,

15:33.265 --> 15:36.769
"No, not at all, Frankie.
You're totally sane and normal."

15:37.937 --> 15:39.188
I'm not that bad, am I?

15:39.271 --> 15:41.816
No, it's just...

15:41.899 --> 15:44.193
Well, you kind of lose yourself
when you're in a relationship.

15:44.276 --> 15:45.487
And you get super clingy.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.196
Like, all of a sudden,
your entire existence

15:47.279 --> 15:48.531
depends on whatever guy you're dating.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.074
And you can be crazy super jealous.

15:50.157 --> 15:52.577
And you put so much pressure
on your relationship to be everything--

15:52.660 --> 15:54.704
Okay, okay.

15:54.787 --> 15:55.872
I get the picture.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.957
Well, you asked for real talk.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.333
Well, I thought Jonah was the problem.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.504
That he wasn't, like, in it.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.296
But, apparently, I'm the problem.

16:06.841 --> 16:08.551
Don't all jump in at once.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.136
We just want you to be happy.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.555
And it seems like...

16:12.639 --> 16:15.975
being with Jonah just kind of...
stresses you out.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.146
I do love him.
A lot.

16:21.105 --> 16:23.149
But... I don't wanna be that girl.

16:23.232 --> 16:26.402
If you're in love with the right person,
I don't think you'd be that girl.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.033
- Okay.

16:35.745 --> 16:39.165
"Impaired consciousness, mood..."

16:40.332 --> 16:41.834
You okay?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.046
I heard about Tristan.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.967
Sorry I couldn't make it.
Just wasn't up to it.

16:50.051 --> 16:51.553
Well, no one's up for this.

16:54.138 --> 16:55.682
"Low ability in maintaining

16:55.765 --> 16:57.725
meaningful relationships
without difficulty."

16:57.809 --> 17:01.353
I don't wanna be my boyfriend's babysitter
for the rest of my life.

17:02.814 --> 17:04.065
What am I supposed to do?

17:05.149 --> 17:06.275
You could kill yourself.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.530
--Wow, you got dark.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.535
I don't know how to protect him...

17:15.618 --> 17:17.119
and still be happy.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.248
You should do what you can
to find some okayness in your life.

17:35.387 --> 17:38.349
I can't get this useless bot
to pour the cereal into the bowl.

17:41.310 --> 17:43.229
I heard your friend woke up.

17:43.312 --> 17:45.397
Yeah,
I still can't believe it.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.233
I never thought I'd get to see him again.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.902
I'm very happy for you.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.904
Excited for your coffee with Winston?

17:52.905 --> 17:55.575
Yup.
I even got my curfew extended.

17:55.658 --> 17:56.659
You did?

17:59.328 --> 18:00.747
Zoë, I'm messing with you.

18:00.830 --> 18:03.374
I figured out that "coffee"
means "date" here.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.709
Well, what else would it mean?

18:05.376 --> 18:09.088
Back home it just means coffee.
Uh...

18:09.171 --> 18:12.258
Does that mean that
when you and I were going for coffee,

18:12.341 --> 18:14.510
that those were dates?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.220
Uh, no.

18:16.303 --> 18:18.681
I mean, sometimes it's not not a date,

18:18.765 --> 18:21.267
but then sometimes it is.
It just depends on...

18:21.893 --> 18:23.645
I just like coffee.
Okay?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.522
- So, not a date.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.607
That's too bad.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.987
Because I like you.

18:34.739 --> 18:37.533
--I like you, too.

18:38.660 --> 18:41.746
-So why did you set me up with Winston?
-I didn't know you were gay.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.081
I am. I just...

18:44.165 --> 18:47.043
I can't be out.
Living with the Nahirs, it's complicated.

18:47.126 --> 18:50.171
No, I get it.
My mom is super Catholic.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.173
Rosaries and everything.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.759
But we can at least give it a shot, right?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.219
Let's make it a double shot...

18:58.595 --> 19:00.723
-of espresso.
-Oh!

19:00.807 --> 19:03.100
--And this time, it's a date.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.075
Is this why you texted me?

19:19.158 --> 19:20.367
To sit in silence?

19:23.370 --> 19:25.707
I like you.
A lot.

19:25.790 --> 19:28.125
I like you, too, Frankie.
I don't know how many times--

19:28.209 --> 19:30.294
Please, just let me finish.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.214
I like you.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.382
But I'm not sure I like myself right now.

19:35.466 --> 19:36.926
What are you talking about?

19:37.009 --> 19:40.304
Being in a relationship seems
to do something weird to me.

19:41.889 --> 19:43.640
I don't want to be the girl
who stalks her boyfriend.

19:43.725 --> 19:45.852
I'm so sorry I didn't tell you about NA.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.937
That's what I mean.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.646
You didn't have to tell me.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.441
And I shouldn't be freaking out
over every little thing.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.903
It's not good for us,
and it's not good for me.

19:55.987 --> 19:58.698
Like... as a human person.

19:59.949 --> 20:01.325
Okay.
So what, then?

20:04.746 --> 20:05.955
I think...

20:06.998 --> 20:08.165
we need a break.

20:09.375 --> 20:11.377
Seriously?

20:11.460 --> 20:13.670
Breaks don't work.
We're asking for trouble.

20:13.755 --> 20:15.422
I don't want to break up.

20:16.758 --> 20:20.094
But I need to figure some stuff out.
So if you're not into that--

20:20.177 --> 20:21.387
Okay, okay.

20:22.972 --> 20:25.141
Fine.
A break it is.

20:25.850 --> 20:26.976
Okay.

21:03.137 --> 21:05.514
I'm sorry I was a jerk.
You don't deserve that.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.017
Damn right, I don't.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.977
Guess we shouldn't talk anymore, hmm?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.353
I'm quitting the play.

21:12.897 --> 21:15.274
Tristan's rehab is gonna be intense.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.110
No, I'll... I'll quit the play.

21:18.820 --> 21:20.487
Okay?
I'm way easier to replace.

21:20.571 --> 21:22.156
That... that's definitely not true.

21:22.239 --> 21:25.159
You wrote the play
to help you deal with stuff.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.743
You still need it.

21:28.704 --> 21:30.122
Okay.
We both stay.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.500
I don't trust anyone else to play Hope.

21:34.168 --> 21:35.837
Are you sure we can still work together?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.296
We'll have to.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.592
Okay.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.594
Then I'll see you at rehearsal.

21:51.268 --> 21:53.520
--Won't be needing these,

21:53.604 --> 21:56.648
- or this, or these.
- What...

21:57.691 --> 21:59.360
Um, I told Jonah we're going on a break.

22:00.486 --> 22:01.487
What?

22:01.570 --> 22:04.031
Does that mean you can date other people?
Or he can?

22:04.115 --> 22:06.909
Yeah. Will you two text?
Or no contact?

22:06.993 --> 22:09.411
Um, we didn't really go over all that.

22:10.496 --> 22:11.663
It doesn't matter.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.917
What matters is taking some time apart,
so I can be the person I want to be.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.086
Ooh.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.006
"Mochaccino."

22:20.089 --> 22:21.966
- Mine, please.
- Okay.

22:22.633 --> 22:24.093
Guess I won't be needing these anymore.

22:24.886 --> 22:27.554
I started taking them when I thought
Jonah and I might be having sex.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.682
Well, it's a good thing you didn't, 'cause
you've been taking your pills wrong.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.770
- Mmm, no, I haven't.
- Uh-huh.

22:34.853 --> 22:38.482
They go from... light to dark.
Like a sunset.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.567
Don't look at me.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.861
No, it's the other way around.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.281
Which means
you've been taking them wrong.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.074
No biggie.
You're not having sex,

22:47.158 --> 22:49.576
and your skin
still looks great.

22:51.954 --> 22:53.289
Oh, my God.

22:54.456 --> 22:55.707
Lo, have you had sex?
