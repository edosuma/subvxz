WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:04.265
Okay, what spaghetti sauce
do you want?

00:04.308 --> 00:05.788
Well, I don't
remember the name.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.659
It's the one with that
actor's face on it.

00:07.703 --> 00:09.052
Paul Newman?

00:09.096 --> 00:11.663
No. The one where the proceeds
go to charity.

00:11.707 --> 00:14.449
Oh. Paul Newman.

00:14.492 --> 00:16.538
No, it's the one who does
all those movies

00:16.581 --> 00:17.843
with Robert Redford.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.149
That's Paul Newman.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.498
You're not listening to me.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.022
I think you mean Paul Newman.

00:22.065 --> 00:23.414
Adam says it's Paul Newman.

00:25.721 --> 00:28.158
Sure. Let's try that.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.856
Oh, don't forget popcorn.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.510
I like the kind with the guy
with that bowtie.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.729
Orville Redenbacher?

00:33.772 --> 00:35.122
No. It's a funny name.

00:35.165 --> 00:37.385
Call me back when Adam tells you

00:37.428 --> 00:40.214
it's Orville Redenbacher.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.694
No! Don't serve her!
I was next.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.696
I mean, why the hell
do you have numbers

00:44.740 --> 00:46.307
if you're just gonna
ignore them?!

00:46.350 --> 00:47.873
I have 24.

00:47.917 --> 00:50.398
I have 24!

00:50.441 --> 00:52.574
Ma'am, please, calm down.Don't tell me to calm down.

00:52.617 --> 00:56.317
Just get me my thinly sliced
low-sodium ham

00:56.360 --> 00:57.840
or I am coming
over that counter.

00:57.883 --> 01:01.496
Back off, 25.

01:01.539 --> 01:03.585
â™ª

01:19.731 --> 01:23.431
"I have 24! I have 24!"

01:23.474 --> 01:25.259
Guys, you had to see it.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.217
She was flipping out over ham.

01:27.261 --> 01:29.393
Why didn't you record it
and put it on YouTube?

01:29.437 --> 01:32.048
I think they even have an
"Old People Losing It" channel.

01:32.092 --> 01:34.050
But it wasn't funny.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.053
Put some circus music behind it,
it'll be funny.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.491
"Old Man Sends Back Soup"
doesn't sound funny, either,

01:40.535 --> 01:43.799
but hit it was a little...

01:43.842 --> 01:45.627
There goes your afternoon.

01:45.670 --> 01:49.065
It's weird to see your sponsor
melting down like that.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.067
I mean, she's the one
I call when I melt down.

01:51.111 --> 01:52.721
You can always talk to me.

01:52.764 --> 01:56.377
I'm usually melting
down because of you.

01:57.856 --> 01:59.510
Well, I think Marjorie is
perfect 'cause here she is.

01:59.554 --> 02:00.772
Hey, Marjorie!

02:00.816 --> 02:03.123
Hello, ladies.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.950
Sorry I'm late.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.169
Nice track suit.Glad you're here.

02:06.213 --> 02:07.214
We weren't talking
about anything.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.130
CHRISTY: So...

02:10.173 --> 02:12.262
anything new with you?

02:12.306 --> 02:14.830
Actually, I was
at the grocery store earlier

02:14.873 --> 02:16.048
and I did something terrible.

02:18.050 --> 02:20.444
I bought cookies
for the meeting.

02:20.488 --> 02:23.143
I just
didn't have time today to bake.

02:23.186 --> 02:27.059
I hope you don't
think less of me.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.540
You're right, Christy.

02:29.584 --> 02:31.890
She's an unhinged lunatic.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.720
Laugh all you want.
You weren't there.

02:35.764 --> 02:37.548
No, this.

02:37.592 --> 02:38.854
Check out grandpa.

02:38.897 --> 02:40.203
A pigeon steals his sandwich.

02:42.118 --> 02:45.208
What's everyone doing Saturday?

02:45.252 --> 02:46.557
We're free.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.342
Don't commit so fast.

02:48.385 --> 02:50.561
That's how we ended up
playing Scattergories

02:50.605 --> 02:52.998
with her weird nurse friends.

02:53.042 --> 02:54.391
That was fun.

02:54.435 --> 02:55.740
I got my
blood pressure checked

02:55.784 --> 02:57.568
and I learned the word,
"penumbra."

02:59.614 --> 03:02.399
I got a Groupon for us all
to get foot massages.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.227
My treat.It's free? We're free.

03:04.271 --> 03:05.924
What's a Groupon?

03:05.968 --> 03:07.491
Oh, for God's sake, Jill.

03:07.535 --> 03:09.101
Rhymes with "coupon,"
has "group" in it.

03:09.145 --> 03:10.190
Use your brain.

03:11.974 --> 03:13.758
Sorry.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.326
Marjorie, is everything okay?

03:16.370 --> 03:18.502
Yeah. Why?

03:18.546 --> 03:22.289
Because you just cast quite
a penumbra over this gathering.

03:23.899 --> 03:25.988
You do seem a little cranky.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.598
Cranky?

03:27.642 --> 03:28.947
What does that mean?

03:28.991 --> 03:32.037
Cantankerous,
irascible, truculent.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.996
See, Jill?
I know words, too.

03:35.476 --> 03:37.347
I don't know what
you're talking about.

03:41.177 --> 03:45.137
Okay. I was
at the grocery store today

03:45.181 --> 03:47.792
and I kind of

03:47.836 --> 03:50.795
saw you kind of yelling
at the deli guy.

03:50.839 --> 03:52.536
Kind of.

03:54.059 --> 03:55.496
I wasn't yelling.

03:55.539 --> 03:56.671
I was setting a boundary.

03:56.714 --> 03:58.455
Sure, sure, sure. Sure.

03:58.499 --> 04:02.590
It just that your boundary
made the deli guy kind of cry.

04:03.765 --> 04:05.245
Well, he skipped over me.

04:05.288 --> 04:08.160
I was merely reminding him
I was there.

04:08.204 --> 04:12.208
Oh, the people at the Yarn Barn
next door knew you were there.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.300
: This is
getting uncomfortable.

04:17.344 --> 04:20.390
:
I know. I love it.

04:20.434 --> 04:23.306
I appreciate your concern,
Christy,

04:23.350 --> 04:25.874
but it's really no big deal.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.399
Okay.

04:29.443 --> 04:32.228
Well, that was a dry hump.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.320
Oh, Christy, I went back
to that shoe store

04:37.364 --> 04:38.843
and that cute sales guy
that gave you his number

04:38.887 --> 04:40.149
said you didn't call.

04:40.192 --> 04:41.455
Why didn't you call?
You should call.

04:41.498 --> 04:43.195
Patrick and I just broke up.

04:43.239 --> 04:45.546
It's way too early
to start seeing someone.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.895
Patrick doesn't think so.

04:46.938 --> 04:48.244
What?

04:48.288 --> 04:50.333
Adam said he's dating
someone else.

04:50.377 --> 04:53.162
Why would you tell me that?

04:53.205 --> 04:55.077
Because I don't keep secrets
from you.

04:55.120 --> 04:59.342
You didn't tell me
who my dad was till I was 36.

04:59.386 --> 05:01.910
That's when
I learned my lesson.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.215
I don't believe this.

05:03.259 --> 05:04.521
Where did he meet her?

05:04.565 --> 05:06.349
No. No, no. Don't tell me.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.003
Where did he meet her?

05:08.046 --> 05:09.352
At a yoga class.

05:09.396 --> 05:10.745
I said don't tell me.

05:11.789 --> 05:14.705
To be fair, you were
a little flippy-floppy.

05:14.749 --> 05:16.707
I truly didn't think
it would bother you.

05:16.751 --> 05:20.407
Of course not because you don't
have normal human emotions.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.539
Hey, stop yelling
at your mother.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.236
Me

05:24.280 --> 05:25.716
You at the deli,

05:25.760 --> 05:26.717
that was yelling.

05:26.761 --> 05:28.545
I am not yelling.

05:28.589 --> 05:32.375
:
It's getting good again.

05:32.419 --> 05:34.377
You totally did!

05:34.421 --> 05:36.684
CHRISTY:
I did not! You're insane.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.295
Uh-oh. Peaceful time is over.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.515
Put yourself in my shoes.

05:41.558 --> 05:43.865
Hi, Adam.
How would you like it?

05:43.908 --> 05:45.519
Hey, we've been
through this already.

05:45.562 --> 05:48.043
Hey, honey. I was just trying
to be honest with you.

05:48.086 --> 05:50.524
Oh, please.This is the part
where we try to figure out

05:50.567 --> 05:52.308
what they're fighting about.You were not trying
to be honest.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.875
You love stirring the pot.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.877
I told you one, tiny thing.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.574
"Tiny"

05:57.618 --> 05:59.271
Why don't you just tell me
if they're having sex?

05:59.315 --> 06:02.100
Well, I've got it.
Have you figured it out yet?

06:02.144 --> 06:03.798
Do you really want to know

06:03.841 --> 06:05.626
or is this just another
one of your traps?

06:05.669 --> 06:07.497
I can't believe you
told her about Patrick.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.585
I didn't tell
her everything.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.065
There's more?

06:10.108 --> 06:13.198
No.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.157
I'm taking Gus for a walk.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.159
I already took him.

06:17.202 --> 06:18.943
Hey, man, I'm not actually
taking him for a walk.

06:18.987 --> 06:22.294
I just want to
get out of here.

06:22.338 --> 06:25.080
All right. Spit it out.

06:25.123 --> 06:26.603
What's she not telling me?

06:26.647 --> 06:29.867
Okay, here's the thing.

06:29.911 --> 06:32.566
I'm not stupid.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.700
Damn it.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.050
Everyone's
pissing me off today.

06:39.094 --> 06:42.184
You, Patrick,
my mom, Marjorie.

06:42.227 --> 06:44.229
Hey, hey, don't say anything
bad about Marjorie.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.709
That woman's a genius.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.450
You barely know her.

06:47.494 --> 06:49.234
I know that she makes
your mother apologize

06:49.278 --> 06:51.454
every time we fight.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.238
I don't know
how she does it.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.502
It's like watching
David Copperfield.

06:55.545 --> 06:59.244
How could Patrick ask me
to move in with him one minute

06:59.288 --> 07:02.987
and then run off
with this yoga chick the next?

07:03.031 --> 07:04.424
They're not running off.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.990
It's one week of
surfing in Costa Rica.

07:06.034 --> 07:07.775
What?

07:07.818 --> 07:11.082
Oh, that's the part she
didn't tell you about, huh?

07:11.126 --> 07:15.347
He was gonna take me
surfing in Costa Rica.

07:15.391 --> 07:18.438
I even pretended to want to.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.484
You know who can make you
feel better about this?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.747
Marjorie.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.053
You should call her.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.579
There you go.

07:29.623 --> 07:32.800
I'm not calling Marjorie.

07:32.843 --> 07:36.281
I am calling this
super cute shoe salesman

07:36.325 --> 07:39.197
who is taller than Patrick,
so you should tell him

07:39.241 --> 07:42.287
'cause I am really,
really into...

07:42.331 --> 07:44.246
does that say Jake or Jack?

07:50.861 --> 07:53.516
Oh, my God,
this feels so good.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.127
I still don't know what the heck
a Groupon is,

07:56.171 --> 07:57.607
but I am loving this.

07:57.651 --> 08:00.218
Wendy, this is wonderful.

08:00.262 --> 08:03.700
I made a wonderful thing happen.
Yippee!

08:03.744 --> 08:05.963
And just like that,
you ruined it.

08:07.269 --> 08:11.403
Foot massage and a date
all in one weekend.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.710
That's right. I have a date.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.407
Big date.

08:15.451 --> 08:16.931
This weekend.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.280
You have a date?

08:18.323 --> 08:19.934
Why, yes, I do.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.892
I thought you said
it was too soon.

08:21.936 --> 08:24.895
Hey, if Patrick can go
to Costa Rica,

08:24.939 --> 08:27.245
I can go out with a manager
of a Lady Foot Locker.

08:27.289 --> 08:29.552
So you're using this fella?

08:29.596 --> 08:31.728
How am I using him?

08:31.772 --> 08:33.338
Well, you weren't
interested in him

08:33.382 --> 08:35.253
until you found out
Patrick was dating.

08:35.297 --> 08:37.125
I'm allowed to change my mind.

08:37.168 --> 08:38.996
I think you're making a mistake.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.563
Well, I don't.

08:40.607 --> 08:42.130
I'd like more pressure
on my heels

08:42.173 --> 08:44.785
and more shut up from you two.

08:44.828 --> 08:46.177
I know what I'm doing.

08:46.221 --> 08:48.179
Okay.

08:48.223 --> 08:52.488
Don't say, "okay," when
it's clearly not "okay."

08:52.532 --> 08:53.924
Just say what you think.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.926
What does it matter
what I think?

08:55.970 --> 08:58.015
You're just gonna do
what you want to do, anyway.

08:58.059 --> 08:59.016
Excuse me?

08:59.060 --> 09:00.714
I'm so tired

09:00.757 --> 09:02.150
of having you ask my opinion.

09:02.193 --> 09:03.978
I give it. You ignore it.
You make a mess.

09:04.021 --> 09:05.719
Then you ask my opinion
about the mess,

09:05.762 --> 09:08.112
I give it, you ignore it
and you make another mess.

09:08.156 --> 09:09.461
What's the point?

09:09.505 --> 09:12.029
I always do what you say.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.944
But lately,
you don't do what you say.

09:15.816 --> 09:18.035
Careful. Slippery feet.

09:18.079 --> 09:20.037
Where are you going?

09:20.081 --> 09:21.648
I'm leaving.

09:21.691 --> 09:24.128
JILL: Marjorie.Don't go.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.782
Marjorie, wait.

09:25.826 --> 09:28.176
Careful. Slippery feet.

09:28.219 --> 09:30.178
Slow down!

09:30.221 --> 09:31.614
Leave me alone.

09:31.658 --> 09:35.313
I could watch this all day.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.358
Should I follow them?

09:36.401 --> 09:37.968
Please do.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.970
It's the only thing that
would make this better.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.929
Aah!

09:41.972 --> 09:45.628
I can't believe you just
stormed out of there.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.500
I have a two-hour break
while Victor has a caregiver

09:48.544 --> 09:50.764
and this isn't how I want
to spend my time.

09:50.807 --> 09:52.287
And you think this
is what I want?

09:52.330 --> 09:53.984
I have no idea what you want.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.857
I want to call you and tell you
I got into a fight with somebody

09:56.900 --> 09:58.380
but I can't because
you're that somebody.

09:58.423 --> 09:59.990
I'm not gonna talk
to you right now.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.036
You're my sponsor.
You have to talk to me.

10:02.079 --> 10:04.255
I don't have to do anything.

10:04.299 --> 10:05.953
I don't know what's going on
with you,

10:05.996 --> 10:07.955
but this isn't working for me.

10:07.998 --> 10:11.654
If we can't talk,
you can't be my sponsor.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.134
Then I can't be your sponsor.

10:15.527 --> 10:18.748
Fine.
Fine.

10:24.188 --> 10:27.235
...and apparently, she's
a 25-year-old fitness model

10:27.278 --> 10:28.628
who's got huge...

10:28.671 --> 10:29.629
Oh, hi, honey.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.594
First you and Patrick break up,
then you and Marjorie.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.118
Are you starting to think
maybe it's you?

10:41.162 --> 10:43.381
Could you just help me
pick a new sponsor?

10:43.425 --> 10:45.645
Absolutely.
This room is chock-full

10:45.688 --> 10:47.995
of strong, sober women,
and Wendy.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.433
What about Catherine?

10:51.476 --> 10:52.782
Are you crazy?

10:52.826 --> 10:54.566
You don't want
a knitter.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.959
You call her with your problems,
all you're gonna hear

10:56.003 --> 10:57.744
is "clickety, click,
click, click."

10:57.787 --> 11:00.224
And then, she's gonna make you
one of those butterfly sweaters,

11:00.268 --> 11:01.617
and you'll have to wear it.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.314
Look at poor Denise.

11:05.447 --> 11:07.579
Hi, Jill.
Hi.

11:07.623 --> 11:09.277
Christy.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.148
Marjorie.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.631
Chilly.

11:15.675 --> 11:18.286
And not the delicious kind
that comes in a bowl.

11:18.329 --> 11:20.288
See? That's why I
need a new sponsor.

11:20.331 --> 11:22.072
To talk about things like that.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.292
And I know exactly
what I'm looking for.

11:24.335 --> 11:28.296
Somebody who's sweet and gentle,
like a drunk Mother Goose.

11:28.339 --> 11:30.777
Bonnie, I saw what you did.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.996
You knock over a cup of coffee,
you clean up a cup of coffee.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.650
You don't understand,
I didn't spill that...

11:34.694 --> 11:36.173
Don't care. Mop's in the closet.

11:36.217 --> 11:38.219
Okay, fine.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.265
Screw Mother Goose.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.702
I want her.

11:44.529 --> 11:46.488
Thanks for having coffee
with me.

11:46.531 --> 11:48.055
I've always liked your shares.

11:49.360 --> 11:50.666
I bet you help a lot of people.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.668
Probably, too many.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.844
So why would you have
time for me?

11:54.888 --> 11:56.933
I'm sorry I bothered you,
I should go.

11:56.977 --> 12:00.720
Wow, you're gonna
be a lot of work.

12:00.763 --> 12:03.461
Does that mean
you'll sponsor me?

12:03.505 --> 12:05.246
Before I answer,
I have one question.

12:05.289 --> 12:07.291
Are they gonna do that
every time we meet?

12:07.335 --> 12:09.163
Now that's what
chicken salad is.Can you believe how much ice

12:09.206 --> 12:10.817
they gave me?My sweater's brown.

12:10.860 --> 12:12.557
I'll talk to them.

12:12.601 --> 12:14.168
Okay, good. Now, I'm gonna need
you to go to at least

12:14.211 --> 12:15.343
five meetings a week.

12:15.386 --> 12:17.998
Wow. Okay, five it is.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.782
And you need
to call me every day.

12:19.826 --> 12:21.175
Sounds good.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.046
Can I call you constantly?

12:23.090 --> 12:25.353
Sure, but not after 8:00,
because that's my family time.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.876
Mine, too.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.052
That's when I'm gonna
need you most.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.489
You call me after 8:00
and it's not an emergency,

12:31.533 --> 12:34.144
you're coming over to watch
Puppy Dog Palswith my kids.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.016
Got it.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.149
Wow.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.368
You've got a lot of rules.

12:40.411 --> 12:41.848
Oh, we're just getting started.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.502
I'm here to sponsor you,
not be your friend.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.678
You seem to have
plenty of those.

12:49.986 --> 12:51.466
So I have a sponsor?

12:51.509 --> 12:52.859
Yes.

12:52.902 --> 12:55.165
Thank you.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.472
Do you want to split
a cheesecake to celebrate?

12:57.515 --> 12:59.300
I don't split things,
I don't think cheese

12:59.343 --> 13:00.997
should be in cake
and I don't like to celebrate.

13:02.694 --> 13:04.871
I'm kidding,
except about the cheesecake.

13:04.914 --> 13:06.394
That's a weird texture.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.745
So, how long have
you been in AA?

13:09.789 --> 13:11.878
26 years.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.749
Whoa.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.185
Did you get sober
in kindergarten?

13:15.229 --> 13:16.665
High school.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.406
I died of a heroin overdose.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.583
For less than a minute, but
it certainly got my attention.

13:21.626 --> 13:23.846
That happened to my mom twice.

13:23.890 --> 13:28.068
Her fix was to steal
a defibrillator.

13:29.243 --> 13:33.247
So, uh, school, work, what else?

13:33.290 --> 13:34.726
Are you in a relationship?

13:34.770 --> 13:36.076
No.

13:36.119 --> 13:37.991
I-I have a date tonight,

13:38.034 --> 13:40.515
but I'm thinking
about cancelling it.Why?

13:40.558 --> 13:42.865
Because I only said yes
after I found out

13:42.909 --> 13:44.911
my previous boyfriend is dating.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.088
Do you think
I'm using the new guy?

13:48.131 --> 13:51.395
How about you just go out
with him and see what happens?

13:51.439 --> 13:52.788
Really?

13:52.832 --> 13:56.226
My philosophy is,
"Just show up."

13:57.837 --> 13:59.273
Mine is, "Worry about stuff

13:59.316 --> 14:01.797
till my hair comes out
in the shower."

14:01.841 --> 14:04.104
How's that working out for you?

14:04.147 --> 14:09.022
I'm not wearing my hair
in a ponytail 'cause I love it.

14:11.241 --> 14:13.113
Hey. On the count of three,

14:13.156 --> 14:14.810
let's laugh real hard
so they think we're having

14:14.854 --> 14:16.116
a better time than they are.

14:16.159 --> 14:18.683
One, two, three.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.516
Y'all made me look
like an idiot.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.394
You weren't at the meeting,
you weren't at the bistro,

14:33.437 --> 14:34.743
you didn't answer your phone.

14:34.786 --> 14:36.310
I just wanted to make sure
your cats

14:36.353 --> 14:38.181
weren't feasting
on your carcass.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.618
Good to see you, too.

14:43.056 --> 14:44.884
I thought about bringing you
something to eat,

14:44.927 --> 14:47.669
but I'm already way out
of my comfort zone

14:47.712 --> 14:49.497
just checking on you.

14:49.540 --> 14:50.933
Oh.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.935
Victor and I already ate,
but thanks.

14:52.979 --> 14:55.155
You want some tea?

14:55.198 --> 14:57.244
As long as I don't have
to lick it out of a saucer.

14:58.593 --> 15:02.031
So, how was the meeting?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.554
Meh. You weren't there.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.339
I missed you.

15:05.382 --> 15:07.341
What's happening to me?

15:07.384 --> 15:09.299
How's Christy doing?

15:09.343 --> 15:11.084
Fine, she's getting
ready for a date.

15:11.127 --> 15:13.738
Something her new
sponsor encouraged.

15:13.782 --> 15:15.349
Oh.

15:15.392 --> 15:17.177
So she found someone already?

15:17.220 --> 15:19.266
Does that upset you?

15:19.309 --> 15:21.964
You gonna go all
"Marjorie wants ham" on me?

15:22.008 --> 15:24.445
I'm happy for her.

15:24.488 --> 15:27.491
Just a little surprised
it happened so quickly.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.971
Eh, it's not that complicated.

15:29.015 --> 15:30.755
Most meetings you can't
swing a dead cat

15:30.799 --> 15:32.409
without hitting
a wise old drunk.

15:32.453 --> 15:36.152
No offense, fellas.

15:36.196 --> 15:39.939
You know, if it were that easy,
I'd have found someone by now.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.593
You still haven't found
a new sponsor?

15:42.637 --> 15:46.641
Uh, Bonnie, I had the same
person for 36 years,

15:46.684 --> 15:49.383
and then she drank, so shoot me

15:49.426 --> 15:52.690
if it's taken a couple of months
to find someone to open up to.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.301
That happened over a year ago.

15:54.344 --> 15:56.390
You haven't had
a sponsor since then?

15:56.433 --> 15:58.087
I've been sober a long time.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.697
It's different for me.

15:59.741 --> 16:02.091
Someone once said
the most dangerous words

16:02.135 --> 16:04.006
for an alcoholic
were "I'm different."

16:04.050 --> 16:05.442
Oh, wait, it was you.

16:05.486 --> 16:09.403
Don't try to use
my stuff against me.

16:09.446 --> 16:10.970
But you have a lot going on.

16:11.013 --> 16:12.972
Your husband
had a stroke.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.930
You're taking care of him,
and sponsoring half of Napa.

16:14.974 --> 16:16.758
You need someone.

16:16.801 --> 16:20.370
You know what? I'm handling
things just fine on my own.

16:20.414 --> 16:24.244
Really? 'Cause there's a deli
guy and a perky wannabe lawyer

16:24.287 --> 16:26.072
that would disagree with that.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.945
I am worried about you.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.514
Seriously,
what is happening to me?

16:36.125 --> 16:37.953
He was very sweet.Hmm.

16:37.997 --> 16:41.435
He took me out to dinner, asked
me all kinds of questions

16:41.478 --> 16:44.264
about myself
and listened to the answers.

16:45.352 --> 16:47.615
I was bored out of my mind.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.617
So when are you
seeing him again?

16:49.660 --> 16:50.835
I'm not.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.011
Yes, you are.

16:52.054 --> 16:53.447
No. There were no sparks.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.622
That's a good thing.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.319
What an alcoholic sees as sparks

16:56.363 --> 16:58.495
is usually the beginning
of a dumpster fire.

16:58.539 --> 17:02.021
What we find boring can
just be healthy, and normal.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.024
I used to only be attracted
to men that were married,

17:05.067 --> 17:06.634
broken and mean.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.027
Mmm.

17:08.070 --> 17:09.202
That sounds hot.

17:10.855 --> 17:13.467
But then, my sponsor made me
go on a second date

17:13.510 --> 17:15.382
with a nice guy
I had no interest in.

17:15.425 --> 17:19.342
Long story short, we've been
happily married for 18 years.

17:19.386 --> 17:21.170
If I had only done
what I wanted to do,

17:21.214 --> 17:23.477
I'd still be supporting
drummers who borrow my car

17:23.520 --> 17:25.131
and never come back.

17:25.174 --> 17:27.611
Do you still have
their phone numbers?

17:30.092 --> 17:31.050
They're doing it again.

17:34.444 --> 17:35.967
Damn it, you guys.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.059
So who would like to share?

17:42.365 --> 17:43.758
Hi.

17:43.801 --> 17:45.586
Marjorie, alcoholic.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.370
ALL:
Hi, Marjorie.

17:47.414 --> 17:49.372
I haven't wanted to share lately

17:49.416 --> 17:51.374
because I've been struggling,

17:51.418 --> 17:54.029
and when you've been
sober a long time,

17:54.073 --> 17:56.075
that can be hard to admit.

17:56.118 --> 17:58.947
But here's
the thing:

17:58.990 --> 18:01.689
getting older sucks.

18:01.732 --> 18:02.864
You know?

18:02.907 --> 18:04.344
People treat me differently.

18:04.387 --> 18:06.172
They don't engage me
in conversation,

18:06.215 --> 18:09.000
they assume there's nothing
interesting about me.

18:09.044 --> 18:11.351
And I just want
to scream at them,

18:11.394 --> 18:16.747
"I robbed a bank, I took a bath
with Jimi Hendrix, I've lived!"

18:18.836 --> 18:22.536
But all they see is a...
is an old woman.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.627
If they see me at all.

18:26.670 --> 18:30.283
The other day,
in the grocery store,

18:30.326 --> 18:33.373
the fella behind
the deli counter

18:33.416 --> 18:35.679
looked right through me
and went on to the next person,

18:35.723 --> 18:38.943
and I completely lost it.

18:41.076 --> 18:44.166
It would have been a good time
to call my sponsor,

18:44.210 --> 18:46.560
but I don't have one.

18:46.603 --> 18:48.649
Yeah.

18:48.692 --> 18:50.216
I know.

18:50.259 --> 18:53.088
Hard to believe, but even
an old-timer like me

18:53.132 --> 18:57.962
can forget that you can't
do this program by yourself.

19:00.704 --> 19:06.580
And I'm grateful that I have
good friends in here

19:06.623 --> 19:08.147
who reminded me.

19:11.628 --> 19:13.630
Thank you.

19:15.980 --> 19:17.417
Look at that.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.462
I fixed Marjorie.

19:28.863 --> 19:30.212
Hey.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.300
Hey.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.476
My mom went to park.

19:33.520 --> 19:36.479
Jill and Wendy are parking, too.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.655
I think we're being set up.

19:38.699 --> 19:41.180
I think you're right.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.877
Christy, I'm sorry.

19:43.443 --> 19:46.097
I've been a gigantic pain
in the ass.

19:46.141 --> 19:48.796
I live with Bonnie Plunkett.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.974
My ass has seen worse.

19:54.802 --> 19:56.238
I loved your share.

19:58.153 --> 20:00.808
I haven't shared like that
in a long time.

20:00.851 --> 20:04.464
It's good to see that
even you struggle sometimes.

20:04.507 --> 20:09.033
You'll be happy to know
I have a new sponsor.

20:09.077 --> 20:10.426
I asked Catherine.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.428
The knitter?Mm-hmm.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.604
She might make you
a butterfly sweater.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.650
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

20:18.347 --> 20:20.784
So we're good?

20:20.828 --> 20:22.569
Yeah. Yeah, we're good.

20:24.005 --> 20:25.963
But I am gonna stick with Nora.

20:26.007 --> 20:27.661
I hope that's okay.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.359
Of course it is, sweetie.

20:30.403 --> 20:33.362
You've come a long way
since we met.

20:33.406 --> 20:36.191
Maybe you just need something
a little different now.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.804
I never could've
gotten sober without you.

20:40.848 --> 20:42.110
Thank you for everything.

20:50.858 --> 20:55.210
No matter how old my mom gets,
she's never gonna be invisible.
