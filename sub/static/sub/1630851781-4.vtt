WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:03.104
* Hey, here comes Sunny
keeping it fun *

00:03.204 --> 00:04.805
* Never says never
never gives up *

00:04.905 --> 00:06.340
* It's Sunny

00:06.440 --> 00:08.909
* Yeah, she's Sunny
Hey! *

00:09.009 --> 00:10.978
* Gear up and go
in the GlamVan *

00:11.079 --> 00:12.780
* Hairstylin'
with her best friends *

00:12.880 --> 00:14.082
* It's Sunny

00:14.182 --> 00:15.616
* Yeah, she's Sunny

00:15.716 --> 00:19.019
* Oh, it's a sunny day

00:19.120 --> 00:23.057
* She'll put a smile
on your face *

00:23.157 --> 00:27.561
* Sunny is shinin' all the way

00:27.661 --> 00:30.798
* Yeah, she's Sunny
yeah, she's Sunny *

00:30.898 --> 00:32.933
* Having a sunny Sunny Day *

00:33.033 --> 00:34.568
Yeah!
Woo-hoo!

00:38.939 --> 00:41.475
**

00:43.010 --> 00:44.512
(laughing)

00:45.946 --> 00:48.516
(laughing)

00:49.617 --> 00:51.119
(humming)

00:52.920 --> 00:53.854
Surprise!

00:53.954 --> 00:56.190
Aaaaah!
Ooh!

00:56.290 --> 00:59.727
Rox, you scared me!
(giggling)

01:01.795 --> 01:04.198
I'm sorry, Blair.
I'm just so excited!

01:04.298 --> 01:05.566
I know.

01:05.666 --> 01:08.001
But if we're going to surprise
Sunny for her birthday,

01:08.102 --> 01:11.805
you'll have to be like me--
cool, calm, collected.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.607
(door bell jingling)
Surprise!

01:13.707 --> 01:16.310
Whoooaaaa!
Whoa.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.078
(gasps)
Oof!

01:18.179 --> 01:21.582
Oof!
(groans)

01:21.682 --> 01:23.151
Sorry, Doodle.

01:23.251 --> 01:25.419
We were practicing
our surprise.
(door bell jingling)

01:25.519 --> 01:26.454
What surprise?

01:26.554 --> 01:28.389
Oh, hi, Sunny!
We were just practicing

01:28.489 --> 01:30.391
our surprise for
Sunny's birthday...

01:30.491 --> 01:31.425
(groans)

01:31.525 --> 01:32.860
(all)
Surprise?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.195
Um...

01:34.295 --> 01:36.063
Oh, it was so much better

01:36.164 --> 01:37.665
every other time
we did it.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.668
We wanted to surprise you
and decorate the salon

01:40.768 --> 01:42.102
for your birthday tomorrow.

01:42.203 --> 01:44.305
You're just so special
to us, and...

01:44.405 --> 01:47.708
We were trying to do it
before you got here.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.177
That was the surprise part.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.245
(giggles)
Thanks, everyone.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.248
I love surprises,
and I love decorating.

01:54.348 --> 01:56.717
So, why don't we do it
together?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.654
(chomping)

02:00.754 --> 02:02.890
That's all the balloons.

02:02.990 --> 02:04.658
Hey, wait a minute.

02:04.758 --> 02:07.161
Hmm, what's this?

02:08.229 --> 02:11.832
(gasps)
It's my wish list book!

02:11.932 --> 02:13.967
Ah, it's a wish list book!

02:14.067 --> 02:16.237
Uh, what's
a wish list book?

02:16.337 --> 02:19.006
I put together a wish list
of all the things

02:19.106 --> 02:22.243
I wanted to try
before this birthday.

02:22.343 --> 02:25.979
Oh... but I forgot
all about it.

02:26.079 --> 02:29.550
Oh, and now there's only
one day to go.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.985
I guess I won't be making
those wishes come true.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.855
Wait!
You said it, Sunny.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.790
You've still got one day!

02:36.890 --> 02:40.027
Maybe if we help, we can make
those birthday wishes happen.

02:40.127 --> 02:43.030
That's a great idea, Blair!

02:43.130 --> 02:45.466
But I had a lot
of wishes.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.901
We'd never get through
them all in time.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.672
Hey, you always say
"never say never."

02:51.772 --> 02:53.741
Bring on the wishes!

02:53.841 --> 02:55.609
(laughs)

02:57.211 --> 02:58.579
Let's see...

02:58.679 --> 03:01.649
Ooh, I wanna bake
my own birthday cake.

03:01.749 --> 03:04.718
Now, that's a wish
I could really get behind.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.087
Me too.
(slurping)

03:07.187 --> 03:10.023
And be a ballerina,
and learn how to ride a pony,

03:10.123 --> 03:12.760
and be a queen for a day!

03:12.860 --> 03:14.228
And fish,
and play guitar,

03:14.328 --> 03:16.297
and learn to knit
and to arrange flowers.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.400
I know that's a lot
of wishes.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.236
Think big,
dream big, go big.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.372
I like it.
Let's do this!

03:24.472 --> 03:27.341
We'll have that wish list done
before you know it.

03:27.441 --> 03:28.476
(barks)

03:28.576 --> 03:31.178
I'll bring a pen
so we can check those wishes.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.513
(camera shutter clicking)
Huh?

03:32.613 --> 03:33.981
And I'll take photos
so we have a record

03:34.081 --> 03:35.082
of the whole day.

03:35.182 --> 03:38.686
Thanks.
This is awesome!

03:38.786 --> 03:40.120
(howling)

03:40.220 --> 03:42.723
(Sunny)
Ready, set...

03:42.823 --> 03:45.559
(all)
Gear up and go!

03:48.962 --> 03:50.831
Where to first, Sunny?

03:50.931 --> 03:53.100
Hmm, let's see.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.337
Ooh, my first wish
was to bake a birthday cake.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.005
What sort of birthday cake?

03:58.105 --> 03:59.940
I always think
the best birthday cake

04:00.040 --> 04:01.875
is a big birthday cake.

04:01.975 --> 04:03.644
About this big!

04:03.744 --> 04:05.245
That's a lot of cake.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.349
Hey, a wish
is a wish, Blair.

04:08.449 --> 04:10.318
(laughs)

04:20.127 --> 04:23.997
A birthday wish list?
That's a great idea!

04:24.097 --> 04:27.034
We'd love to help.
Wouldn't we, Ralph?

04:27.134 --> 04:28.669
(meows)

04:28.769 --> 04:30.037
Thanks, Cindy!

04:30.137 --> 04:32.573
(purring, meows)

04:32.673 --> 04:33.674
Huh?

04:33.774 --> 04:35.075
(barking)

04:35.175 --> 04:37.210
Hey!
I'm ticklish!

04:37.311 --> 04:40.247
(all laughing)

04:40.348 --> 04:42.983
I've never baked a cake
on my own before,

04:43.083 --> 04:45.152
but I do really like
eating them.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.555
What sort of cake
would you like to make?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.823
A really big one!

04:49.923 --> 04:52.660
Or, whatever Sunny wants?

04:52.760 --> 04:56.196
Hmm... maybe something
with berries?

04:56.296 --> 04:59.099
Ooh! Ooh! Vanilla icing!
Yellow ribbons?

04:59.199 --> 05:00.834
Come right this way.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.202
I told you...
(laughing)

05:02.302 --> 05:03.937
I'm ticklish!

05:04.037 --> 05:06.206
Hey, wait for me!

05:07.975 --> 05:13.080
The key to baking a cake is
following the recipe exactly.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.315
You need to measure
the right ingredients

05:15.416 --> 05:17.718
and do everything
in the right order.

05:17.818 --> 05:21.321
(giggles)
This is going to be so much fun.

05:21.422 --> 05:24.958
First, you take
your flour...

05:25.058 --> 05:27.127
then, your sugar...

05:27.227 --> 05:29.763
then, your eggs.

05:34.067 --> 05:36.336
Is it ready to eat yet?

05:36.437 --> 05:40.040
(chuckles)
Not just yet, Doodle.

05:40.140 --> 05:43.143
Okay.
What about now?

05:43.243 --> 05:45.178
Still no.

05:45.278 --> 05:47.515
First, we need to bake them.

05:49.717 --> 05:50.918
Now what, Cindy?

05:51.018 --> 05:54.888
The best part... decorating!

05:58.358 --> 05:59.793
(Sunny laughing)

05:59.893 --> 06:01.862
Mmm!

06:01.962 --> 06:03.531
Hmm...

06:03.631 --> 06:06.299
Every birthday cake
should have flower decorations.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.502
Marshmallows... perfect!

06:08.602 --> 06:10.404
Mmm. Wow!

06:10.504 --> 06:13.941
You know what, these cakes
are great on their own,

06:14.041 --> 06:17.545
but they'd be even better
if we put them together.

06:17.645 --> 06:18.879
(camera shutter clicking)

06:21.582 --> 06:23.784
I love food that wobbles!

06:23.884 --> 06:25.453
Let's eat!
(laughs)

06:25.553 --> 06:27.555
(gasps)
Stop!

06:27.655 --> 06:28.922
Huh?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.858
You have to let it cool.

06:30.958 --> 06:32.092
(all sigh)

06:32.192 --> 06:34.027
We can come back later
for the cake.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.996
Good idea, Sunny.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.198
I'll miss you,
but don't worry.

06:38.298 --> 06:40.934
I'll see you later.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.771
Thanks for making my birthday
wish come true, Cindy.

06:43.871 --> 06:47.140
It was our pleasure.
Wasn't it, Ralph?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.676
See you later.
Have a sunny day!

06:48.776 --> 06:49.777
Bye, Ralph!

06:49.877 --> 06:51.244
(meows)
(chuckles)

06:51.344 --> 06:54.314
Let it go, Rox.
Let it go.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.450
(sighs)
Whoa!

06:57.685 --> 06:59.487
(camera shutter clicking)

07:00.988 --> 07:05.025
So, what is next on your
birthday wish list, Sunny?

07:05.125 --> 07:06.860
(Sunny)
To be a ballet dancer.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.362
The ballerinas
are rehearsing in the park.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.900
I'm sure they'll help.
Let's go!

07:13.000 --> 07:16.737
**

07:19.573 --> 07:22.175
Dancing is always
on my wish list.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.177
Uh-huh?

07:24.277 --> 07:25.746
Oh.
(chuckles)

07:25.846 --> 07:27.681
Whoa!
Excuse me.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.783
(humming)

07:29.883 --> 07:31.885
Oh, pardon me.

07:31.985 --> 07:36.757
Whoa-oh...
Whoa, whoa!

07:38.158 --> 07:39.326
A little help?

07:39.426 --> 07:40.561
(all laugh)
Oh, Doodle.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.896
(camera shutter clicking)

07:42.996 --> 07:45.699
(sighs)
Thanks.

07:45.799 --> 07:48.068
Ah, I knew I should have
done my warm-ups.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.069
(laughs)

07:49.169 --> 07:50.638
Hi, Sunny.
Hi, Hannah.

07:50.738 --> 07:52.405
Did you come to watch
our new show?

07:52.506 --> 07:54.908
Actually, I came
to try ballet dancing,

07:55.008 --> 07:56.544
and I'm hoping you can help.

07:56.644 --> 07:58.646
Sunny's got
a birthday wish list.

07:58.746 --> 08:02.049
And being a ballerina
is one of those wishes.

08:02.149 --> 08:03.383
We'd love to help!

08:03.483 --> 08:05.886
But first, you have
to look the part.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.621
Oh!

08:09.356 --> 08:11.892
Whoa!

08:11.992 --> 08:15.195
Now I feel like a ballerina.

08:15.295 --> 08:18.599
Okay, Sunny, let's start
with something easy.

08:20.768 --> 08:22.369
Your turn.

08:22.469 --> 08:24.304
(grunting)
Oh!

08:24.404 --> 08:27.575
Have you got something
even easier?

08:32.512 --> 08:35.015
Huh?
Whoa, whoa.

08:35.115 --> 08:38.986
(chuckles)
Ballet's a lot
harder than it looks.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.187
Whoa!

08:40.287 --> 08:41.321
A little help?

08:41.421 --> 08:42.590
Thanks, Doodle.

08:42.690 --> 08:45.826
Maybe you should do ballet
Sunny style!

08:45.926 --> 08:47.928
That, I can do.

08:49.663 --> 08:51.131
(Rox and Blair)
Sunny!

08:51.231 --> 08:52.966
Woo-hoo!

08:56.069 --> 08:57.771
(both cheering)

08:59.306 --> 09:01.609
(both laughing)

09:06.546 --> 09:09.482
I did it!
I really did it!

09:09.583 --> 09:12.085
I was a ballerina,
and it was amazing!

09:12.185 --> 09:14.221
Yeah, Sunny!
Another wish complete

09:14.321 --> 09:16.223
on your birthday wish list.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.457
(Blair)
Check!

09:17.557 --> 09:20.460
Where are we going
for the next wish?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.630
(all)
The boardwalk!

09:28.368 --> 09:30.871
So, you wanna learn
how to ride a pony.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.407
Well, Suzette here
is happy to help.

09:34.507 --> 09:35.776
(Suzette whinnying)

09:35.876 --> 09:38.311
Thanks, Johnny Ray.
Thanks, Suzette.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.180
Okay, what first?

09:40.280 --> 09:41.649
(giggles)
Well, I'm no expert,

09:41.749 --> 09:44.384
but you probably need
to get on the pony.

09:44.484 --> 09:47.187
The key to riding a pony
is grace, elegance

09:47.287 --> 09:48.689
and a sense of balance.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.191
Gotcha.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.426
You put your foot
in the stirrup here

09:53.526 --> 09:54.895
and just hop right up.

09:54.995 --> 09:55.996
(Suzette chortling)

09:56.096 --> 09:59.599
Huh... shouldn't you
be facing the other way?

09:59.700 --> 10:01.702
(Johnny Ray and Sunny chuckle)

10:01.802 --> 10:05.105
At least this way, you get
to see where you've been.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.340
Here you go, let me help.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.276
That probably is better.

10:09.376 --> 10:10.610
(whinnies)
Ooh!

10:10.711 --> 10:13.446
Um... stop!
Stop, Suzette!

10:13.546 --> 10:17.718
You need to speak pony.
"Whoa" is pony for "stop!"

10:17.818 --> 10:19.186
Whooaaa!

10:19.286 --> 10:21.188
Whoa, Suzette.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.589
Wow, I did it.

10:22.690 --> 10:25.392
Well done, Sunny.
You're doing great!

10:25.492 --> 10:27.627
Woo-hoo!
(whinnies)

10:27.728 --> 10:30.197
I'm not sure I've nailed
that grace, elegance

10:30.297 --> 10:31.564
and sense of balance.

10:31.665 --> 10:36.569
A-ha, I know.
Safety first.

10:36.670 --> 10:39.973
Now, if I bounce up and down,
I won't bounce off.

10:40.073 --> 10:43.443
And these hair grips
will help me hold on tighter.

10:43.543 --> 10:46.413
What do you need
the ribbon for?

10:46.513 --> 10:49.116
(giggles)
Just in case

10:49.216 --> 10:51.251
steps one and two
don't work.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.787
This way,
I'll definitely be safe.

10:53.887 --> 10:57.691
* Riding high, there she goes
everybody do-si-do *

10:57.791 --> 11:00.493
This is a lot of fun.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.830
Thanks for helping me
make this wish come true.

11:02.930 --> 11:05.032
I couldn't have done it
without you all.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.400
I'm really riding a pony!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.336
I can't believe it!

11:09.436 --> 11:11.371
Believe it!

11:11.471 --> 11:12.439
(sniffing)

11:12.539 --> 11:14.007
(Sunny)
Whoa, Suzette!

11:14.107 --> 11:16.009
Uh, whoa, Suzette!

11:16.109 --> 11:17.177
Suzette, stop!

11:17.277 --> 11:18.746
Oh, no!

11:18.846 --> 11:20.981
No, no, no!
I think Suzette's
only speaking apple

11:21.081 --> 11:22.082
at the moment!

11:22.182 --> 11:23.817
Whoa there, Suzette!

11:26.353 --> 11:28.789
(whinnying)

11:29.890 --> 11:31.491
Whoa!

11:31.591 --> 11:33.393
Wow, Sunny!

11:33.493 --> 11:36.196
You've only been riding for...
a few minutes,

11:36.296 --> 11:37.965
and you're ready
for a rodeo.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.266
(Suzette neighs)

11:39.366 --> 11:40.600
Thanks, Johnny Ray.

11:40.700 --> 11:43.236
And I'll be back to ride
you again soon, Suzette.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.204
(whinnies)

11:44.304 --> 11:45.638
(giggles)

11:45.739 --> 11:47.607
There!
(laughs)

11:47.707 --> 11:49.743
* Hey, hey, now
it's your birthday *

11:49.843 --> 11:51.779
* A fun time, feel-good
all-about-you day *

11:51.879 --> 11:53.646
* Doing the things
you want to do *

11:53.747 --> 11:55.749
* Let's celebrate you
oh, yeah *

11:55.849 --> 11:57.751
* What you wanna do?
Let's go do it *

11:57.851 --> 11:59.686
* No time to waste,
so let's get to it *

11:59.787 --> 12:01.755
* Make a wish
watch it come true *

12:01.855 --> 12:03.656
* Let's celebrate you, whoo!

12:03.757 --> 12:06.059
(Rox)
* Let's get excited

12:06.159 --> 12:07.761
* You're all invited

12:07.861 --> 12:11.531
* We're gonna have the greatest
birthday time of all *

12:11.631 --> 12:13.566
* Yeah, yeah
* We know you're wishing

12:13.666 --> 12:15.803
* To do everything from
knitting to fishing *

12:15.903 --> 12:19.773
* No time to waste,
so come, let's have a ball *

12:19.873 --> 12:21.741
* Hey, hey, now
it's your birthday *

12:21.842 --> 12:23.777
* A fun time, feel-good
all-about-you day *

12:23.877 --> 12:25.578
* Doing the things
you want to do *

12:25.678 --> 12:27.714
* Let's celebrate you

12:27.815 --> 12:31.919
* It's all underway
for the queen of the day *

12:32.019 --> 12:35.122
* So grab your six-string
and play *

12:35.222 --> 12:36.423
* Yeah, yeah, yeah

12:36.523 --> 12:37.825
* Hey, hey, now
it's your birthday *

12:37.925 --> 12:39.793
* A fun time, feel-good
all-about-you day *

12:39.893 --> 12:41.561
* Doing the things
you want to do *

12:41.661 --> 12:43.696
* Let's celebrate you
uh-huh *

12:43.797 --> 12:45.732
* Having a blast
all together *

12:45.833 --> 12:47.734
* Spending time
with our best friend ever *

12:47.835 --> 12:49.536
* Watching all your wishes
come true *

12:49.636 --> 12:51.438
* Today's all you

12:51.538 --> 12:56.576
* Oh, yeah
let's celebrate you **

12:56.676 --> 12:58.778
(laughing)

13:02.482 --> 13:03.851
(Sunny)
Let's see...

13:03.951 --> 13:06.553
I've been a ballerina
and ridden a pony,

13:06.653 --> 13:08.055
and fished,
and arranged flowers,

13:08.155 --> 13:10.457
played the guitar,
baked a cake,

13:10.557 --> 13:12.125
and knitted a scarf.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.794
I was even a queen!
For an hour, anyway.

13:14.895 --> 13:17.831
That's a lot
of checks, Sunny.

13:17.931 --> 13:21.368
That's my birthday
wish list all done.

13:21.468 --> 13:22.702
Check!
Oh!

13:22.802 --> 13:25.238
Hold those checks, Sunny.

13:25.338 --> 13:28.375
It looks like you've got
one last wish left.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.043
Oh!
It must have been tucked

13:30.143 --> 13:32.079
in the back of this scrapbook
and we missed it.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.246
Hm?

13:33.346 --> 13:37.350
You want to blow up
a really big balloon?

13:37.450 --> 13:39.719
That's a drawing
of a plate.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.155
So, Sunny wishes
she had a really big plate.

13:42.255 --> 13:45.692
But she doesn't want
any food on it?

13:45.792 --> 13:48.495
That's no plate,
that's the moon!

13:48.595 --> 13:51.398
It's always been
my biggest wish

13:51.498 --> 13:52.832
to visit the moon one day.

13:52.933 --> 13:56.303
That wish might be
a little tricky.

13:56.403 --> 13:57.637
Doodle's right.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.874
It's one thing to ride a pony
or bake a big cake.

14:00.974 --> 14:02.976
But the moon
is really far away,

14:03.076 --> 14:07.814
plus we'd need a spaceship
and astronaut suits and...

14:07.915 --> 14:10.150
We're sorry, Sunny.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.219
We really wanted
to make everything

14:12.319 --> 14:14.621
on your birthday wish list
come true.

14:14.721 --> 14:18.691
But this one
might be a little hard.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.828
Hmm... that's okay.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.965
I did everything else,
thanks to you.

14:25.065 --> 14:29.970
And I know there's no way
I could really go to the moon.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.311
(sighs)

14:38.411 --> 14:41.048
Mmm... I feel bad.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.082
I feel sad.

14:42.182 --> 14:45.252
Sunny sure doesn't
look very sunny.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.655
I really wish we could
help her get to the moon.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.457
Sunny never gives up,

14:50.557 --> 14:52.559
no matter how hard
a problem is.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.361
So, we can't
give up either.

14:54.461 --> 14:57.730
You have that "I'm about
to have a brilliant idea" look!

14:57.830 --> 14:59.666
I do, and it's big!

14:59.766 --> 15:01.801
My favorite kind of idea!

15:01.901 --> 15:03.703
And we'll need
a lot of help.

15:03.803 --> 15:06.306
Then why don't we call
all our friends?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.340
It's for Sunny.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.641
They'd love to help.
Great!

15:08.741 --> 15:11.878
But how do we keep it
a surprise from Sunny?

15:11.979 --> 15:13.580
A real surprise this time.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.782
Doodle, can you keep
Sunny busy

15:15.882 --> 15:18.351
while we do some
serious wish-fixing?

15:18.451 --> 15:19.552
Check!

15:19.652 --> 15:20.988
(phone ringing)

15:21.088 --> 15:22.055
Hello?
Cindy!

15:22.155 --> 15:24.624
Could you make something
special for Sunny?

15:24.724 --> 15:25.825
For Sunny?

15:25.925 --> 15:28.695
Oh, I know just
what to bring.

15:28.795 --> 15:30.230
Have a sunny day!

15:30.330 --> 15:31.631
Hey, Sunny.

15:31.731 --> 15:34.167
Oh, did I ever show you
my photo collection

15:34.267 --> 15:36.669
of all the dog biscuits
I've ever eaten?

15:36.769 --> 15:39.006
No, I don't think so, Doodle.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.075
Perfect!
Well, let me just pull
them up on the big screen.

15:42.175 --> 15:45.378
It's only a few
hundred photos.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.513
Oh!

15:46.613 --> 15:47.580
(phone ringing)

15:47.680 --> 15:48.982
Hello?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.252
Hello!

15:52.352 --> 15:53.686
Hello!

15:53.786 --> 15:58.158
Here's me with a biscuit.
So cute.

15:58.258 --> 16:01.528
Ah, and here's me
with another biscuit.

16:01.628 --> 16:03.863
Or was it a peanut butter
doggie drop?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.465
Let's zoom in here.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.300
For Sunny?
I'll be there!

16:07.400 --> 16:08.335
Of course we'll be there!

16:08.435 --> 16:09.369
Thank you!
Bye-bye!

16:09.469 --> 16:10.637
Done!

16:10.737 --> 16:12.172
Ah, and now...
(yawns)

16:12.272 --> 16:14.207
here's the highlight
of my collection--

16:14.307 --> 16:17.444
a photo of my most favorite
biscuit of all!

16:17.544 --> 16:18.545
(door bell jingling)

16:18.645 --> 16:19.612
Hey!

16:19.712 --> 16:21.048
But that'll have to wait.

16:21.148 --> 16:22.715
It's not like I've got
all day to sit around

16:22.815 --> 16:24.584
looking at photos, Sunny.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.088
But... it was your idea
to look at them.

16:28.188 --> 16:31.858
And what is
your favorite biscuit, anyway?

16:31.958 --> 16:34.527
And where did everyone go?

16:34.627 --> 16:36.729
Hello? Anybody?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.267
Hi, Sunny!
There you are!
Oh!

16:40.367 --> 16:41.534
(gasps)
Close your eyes.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.703
Come with me, let's go!

16:43.803 --> 16:47.207
But-- but, Rox,
what's going on?

16:47.307 --> 16:50.543
Welcome aboard
Flight Happy Birthday, Sunny.

16:50.643 --> 16:52.112
Please keep your arms
and legs

16:52.212 --> 16:55.048
and all the rest of you
inside the vehicle.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.249
Huh?

16:56.349 --> 16:57.950
Doodle?

16:59.052 --> 17:02.789
Wow, you look...
what  do  you look like?

17:02.889 --> 17:04.657
An astronaut!

17:04.757 --> 17:06.993
I know, I look awesome, right?

17:07.094 --> 17:09.829
Oh, and I used up
all your silver hair foils,

17:09.929 --> 17:11.498
so we'll have to order
some more.

17:11.598 --> 17:12.765
Okay.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.302
What's going on?

17:15.402 --> 17:18.238
Please take a seat while
I power up this rocket ship.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.208
(computer chirping)

17:21.308 --> 17:22.542
Rocket ship?

17:24.177 --> 17:27.714
Astronaut Rox, have you shut
the rocket ship door?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.349
Check!

17:29.449 --> 17:31.351
(imitating headset crackling)
Astronaut Blair,

17:31.451 --> 17:33.320
have you pushed lots
of important buttons?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.789
Beep-boop, beep-boop,
boop-boop-beep. Check!

17:36.889 --> 17:38.958
Then we are cleared
for lift-off!

17:39.058 --> 17:43.062
Countdown to launch.
Ten, nine...

17:43.163 --> 17:45.232
(laughing)
What are you all up to?

17:45.332 --> 17:46.399
You'll see.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.301
(Doodle)
Eight...

17:48.401 --> 17:49.969
Seven...
(laughing)

17:50.069 --> 17:54.341
Six... five... four...

17:54.441 --> 17:56.143
three...
(gasps)

17:56.243 --> 17:58.745
two... one...

17:58.845 --> 18:01.848
and we have blast-off!

18:08.921 --> 18:10.490
We have touchdown!

18:10.590 --> 18:13.059
Thank you for traveling
on Doodle's rocket ship.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.495
I have been
your captain, Doodle.

18:15.595 --> 18:16.963
Thank you, Captain.

18:17.063 --> 18:19.299
Some space fog.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.202
(making space noises)

18:22.302 --> 18:24.771
(chuckles)
It'll be Sunny's
next birthday

18:24.871 --> 18:26.139
if we don't hurry, Doodle.

18:26.239 --> 18:28.074
Sorry... I was
in character.

18:28.175 --> 18:30.477
Space walking!
(girls giggling)

18:31.911 --> 18:33.480
(owl hooting)

18:33.580 --> 18:36.015
Whoa!
Where are we?

18:36.115 --> 18:39.152
(Blair)
You're about to find out.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.053
(giggles)

18:42.589 --> 18:44.691
(Doodle panting)

18:44.791 --> 18:47.160
Let's go!

18:47.260 --> 18:48.995
Come on!

18:49.095 --> 18:51.030
Almost there-- whoa!

18:51.130 --> 18:52.732
(crowd)
Surprise!

18:52.832 --> 18:53.900
Oh!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.835
Doodle, are you okay?

18:55.935 --> 18:57.670
(all)
Surprise!

18:57.770 --> 19:00.973
Surprises are so hard
to get right.

19:01.073 --> 19:06.513
It's your very own
moon-themed birthday party!

19:06.613 --> 19:08.080
I can't believe this!

19:08.181 --> 19:10.383
I brought your cake,
but I gave it

19:10.483 --> 19:12.151
a little finishing touch.

19:12.252 --> 19:15.788
Thanks so much, Cindy.
It's fantastic!

19:15.888 --> 19:18.024
And Ralph's
a space alien.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.192
(purring, meowing)

19:19.292 --> 19:20.627
(whispering)
It's all right.

19:20.727 --> 19:22.862
He's a friendly
space alien.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.163
How cute!

19:24.264 --> 19:26.299
And I brought you
some moon flowers!

19:26.399 --> 19:29.269
They're called that because
they only grow at night,

19:29.369 --> 19:31.137
which makes them
very special.

19:31.238 --> 19:34.173
Thanks, Peter.
They're beautiful!

19:34.274 --> 19:37.877
And I made the ground look like
the surface of the moon...

19:37.977 --> 19:40.947
sort of-- just a bit
of raking and digging.

19:41.047 --> 19:42.048
(sniffing)
Doodle!

19:42.148 --> 19:43.350
Watch that...
Whoa!

19:43.450 --> 19:44.317
...crater.

19:44.417 --> 19:46.519
I'm okay.

19:46.619 --> 19:49.722
And I borrowed some balls from
the ball pit at the arcade.

19:49.822 --> 19:53.226
(gasps)
They look just like planets.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.928
My birthday wish list
is complete!

19:56.028 --> 19:57.797
Thank you, everyone.

19:57.897 --> 20:01.701
(all singing)
* Happy birthday to you

20:01.801 --> 20:05.037
* Happy birthday
to you *

20:05.137 --> 20:07.607
* Happy birthday, dear Sunny

20:07.707 --> 20:10.577
* Happy birthday to you *

20:10.677 --> 20:12.245
(howling)

20:12.345 --> 20:13.680
(blowing)

20:13.780 --> 20:15.615
If you made a wish,

20:15.715 --> 20:17.750
you should probably
tell us now,

20:17.850 --> 20:19.686
so we can start planning.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.654
I know what my wish is...

20:21.754 --> 20:23.222
that we can eat this cake!

20:23.323 --> 20:25.258
I don't need
another thing.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.527
You've made all my wishes
come true.

20:27.627 --> 20:30.863
I just wish there were
some stars out tonight.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.965
I think I can make
that happen.

20:33.065 --> 20:37.670
Hm, okay... bobby pins,
hair elastics, brush.

20:37.770 --> 20:41.274

20:51.718 --> 20:53.286
Ta-dah!
(both gasp)

20:53.386 --> 20:54.721
Wow!
Stars!

20:54.821 --> 20:56.723
They look just like stars.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.625
(Rox)
Awesome!

20:58.725 --> 21:01.093
It's my night sky
star-braid.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.596
I've been saving it for
the day I went to the moon,

21:03.696 --> 21:05.231
and today's that day!

21:05.332 --> 21:06.933
It's one
for the Style Files.

21:07.033 --> 21:09.969
My final birthday wish
come true.

21:10.069 --> 21:15.842
This has officially been
the best birthday ever...

21:15.942 --> 21:17.344
thanks to my best friends.

21:17.444 --> 21:20.313
And it's not quite
over yet.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.882
(Rox and Blair)
Surprise!

21:22.982 --> 21:23.950
(Sunny gasps)

21:24.050 --> 21:25.785
The best view
in Friendly Falls.

21:25.885 --> 21:30.890
Wow... the moon looks
so close, I could touch it.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.258
Look!

21:33.593 --> 21:36.529
Now, that's one
for the Style Files.

21:36.629 --> 21:39.198
(Rox and Blair)
Happy birthday, Sunny.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.401
(camera shutter clicking)

21:41.734 --> 21:43.202
Hi!
It's me, Sunny!

21:43.302 --> 21:46.739
Want to take a look inside
the Style Files?

21:46.839 --> 21:50.510
That is one cool star-braid!
Wow!

21:50.610 --> 21:54.046
For this hairstyle and more,
check out Sunny's Style Files

21:54.146 --> 21:56.916

21:57.016 --> 22:00.920
Keep smiling, keep styling!
