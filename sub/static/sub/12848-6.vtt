00:00.001 --> 00:03.068
<i>It's the fifth day
of the worst heat wave</i>

00:03.070 --> 00:04.770
<i>in San Antonio's history.</i>

00:04.772 --> 00:07.740
<i>Temperatures will be reaching
102 by 5 P.M.,</i>

00:07.742 --> 00:09.575
<i>and won't be letting up
anytime soon.</i>

00:14.515 --> 00:16.248
I made you an herb omelette.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.285
Ooh. Again, huh?

00:20.287 --> 00:21.520
* two is better than one *

00:21.522 --> 00:22.788
that's too bad
it's gonna get cold.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.090
* better than one *

00:25.092 --> 00:28.794
* nothing is forever *

00:28.796 --> 00:30.429
* oh, bye, bye, bye *

00:33.501 --> 00:35.267
* bye, bye, bye *

00:39.373 --> 00:42.674
* one wants to give,
one wants to take *

00:42.676 --> 00:46.111
* one tries to fix me up *

00:46.113 --> 00:49.348
* one is a mistake, my, my, my *

00:52.386 --> 00:54.286
* oh, my, my, my *

00:58.492 --> 01:00.092
* shake me up *

01:01.595 --> 01:04.830
* I want you to take me up *

01:07.701 --> 01:09.835
* wake me up *

01:09.837 --> 01:12.337
hey, where are you going?

01:12.339 --> 01:14.173
Jessica?

01:15.810 --> 01:17.443
Jessica?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.680
Hey, Jess?

01:24.151 --> 01:27.486
Jessica?
Hey, I gotta go to work.

01:27.488 --> 01:28.821
Jessica!

01:31.725 --> 01:34.126
102. Damn, that's hot.

01:35.596 --> 01:38.697
Maybe we should call in sick.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.299
Huh?

01:40.301 --> 01:43.102
Stay in this nice
air conditioned apartment.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.771
Might look a little suspicious,

01:45.773 --> 01:49.108
both of us sick
on the same night.

01:49.110 --> 01:51.810
What's the worst that
can happen? Rumor mill starts?

01:53.280 --> 01:55.614
The hospital...
Hmm?

01:55.616 --> 01:56.882
Will make us take

01:56.884 --> 02:01.520
a day-long
sexual harassment seminar.

02:01.522 --> 02:03.689
And I've got better things
to do.

02:05.392 --> 02:07.392
* shake me up *

02:08.895 --> 02:12.164
* I want you to take me up *

02:14.902 --> 02:16.668
* wake me up *

02:18.639 --> 02:21.473
sure we should be doing this
in front of your work?

02:27.414 --> 02:29.214
Never mind.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.521
Hey. How's it going, T.C.?

02:35.523 --> 02:36.922
Good. You?

02:36.924 --> 02:38.824
Oh, never better.

02:41.862 --> 02:43.695
What's going on
with the whistling?

02:43.697 --> 02:45.197
Looks like someone's getting
a little somethin' somethin'

02:45.199 --> 02:46.832
in the bedroom.
Hmm.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.600
That obvious, huh?

02:48.602 --> 02:50.569
Talking about Scott,
but thanks for the update.

02:50.571 --> 02:52.237
Now we know what
you've been up to.

02:52.239 --> 02:54.806
And apparently it was all day,
'cause you look like hell.

02:54.808 --> 02:57.276
Jessica?

02:57.278 --> 02:58.810
Wouldn't you like to know, huh?

02:58.812 --> 03:00.712
Hey, you're not the only one
getting action.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.447
Ever since I started
working out,

03:02.449 --> 03:03.916
I can't keep my hands off Janet.

03:03.918 --> 03:06.285
It's like this morning, we got busy

03:06.287 --> 03:08.554
for, like... 10 minutes.

03:10.057 --> 03:11.557
You wanna hear about
my sex life with Rick?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.825
This is what we're doing now?

03:13.827 --> 03:16.361
Female, 30.
Collapsed during a marathon.

03:16.363 --> 03:18.096
BP's 90 over palp.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.830
Pulse is tachy and irregular.
Temp's 102.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.667
Sounds like heat stroke.
Trauma 1.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.635
Oh, who runs a marathon
in this temperature?

03:23.637 --> 03:25.304
Charity race.
Lots of heatstroke.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.672
More coming behind us.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.574
Sounds like it's only
the beginning.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.345
Temp is still up,

03:33.347 --> 03:34.947
but your heart rate's
coming down.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.782
Okay. You feeling better?

03:36.784 --> 03:40.519
A little bit. I've had a fever
for a couple of days.

03:40.521 --> 03:41.920
But I just ignored it.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.722
Didn't wanna miss the race.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.757
You're pretty hard-core.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.227
Didn't used to be.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.662
I went through a really bad
divorce this year.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.898
I decided I needed
to make a change.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.467
I started weight training,
exercising.

03:55.469 --> 03:57.336
I lost 50 pounds.
Wow.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.004
Congratulations.
Deep breath.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.676
There we go. Okay.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.011
Didn't realize
how depressed I was

04:06.013 --> 04:07.579
until my marriage was over.

04:10.284 --> 04:11.984
You find it hard to move on?

04:13.487 --> 04:15.954
It's one of the hardest things
I've ever done.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.923
I'm training for
a tough mudder right now.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.958
That's a piece of cake
next to my divorce.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.697
How long you had this rash?

04:25.699 --> 04:27.666
About a week.
Hmm.

04:27.668 --> 04:29.368
I thought it was from all the sweating.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.503
Hmm. Maybe.

04:31.505 --> 04:33.639
I wanna run some blood work.

04:33.641 --> 04:35.390
Persistent fever, rash.
Ah. You might

04:35.415 --> 04:36.908
have a virus.

04:38.711 --> 04:40.511
Gotta make sure you're healthy
for that tough mudder, hmm?

04:40.514 --> 04:42.648
All right, doc.

04:46.287 --> 04:49.655
How did you find out about this?

04:49.657 --> 04:51.790
Some guy from bumble.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.458
Oh!

04:53.460 --> 04:54.559
Oh!

04:54.561 --> 04:55.861
If you dated around more,

04:55.863 --> 04:58.063
you might actually have
some fun, Jordan.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.299
Oh! That was just wrong!

05:00.301 --> 05:03.335
<i>El matador</i> is kicking his ass.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.470
<i>El matador's</i> my cousin.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.939
He specializes in this move
called Montezuma's revenge.

05:07.941 --> 05:10.609
It was made famous by this
Cuban wrestler named Konnan.

05:10.611 --> 05:11.810
My cousin does it the best.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.578
Check it out.
He's about to do it.

05:13.580 --> 05:14.913
He lifts El Tigre up,

05:14.915 --> 05:17.816
hooks his legs so he can't
touch the ground.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.318
And with his free arm,

05:19.319 --> 05:20.819
puts El Tigre's head
into his armpit,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.355
driving El Tigre's head
into the mat.

05:23.357 --> 05:24.489
Bam!

05:24.491 --> 05:25.991
Yeah! Yeah!

05:31.965 --> 05:34.633
I really wanna be a <i> Luchador.</i>

05:34.635 --> 05:38.437
Gotta gain some weight.
I eat all the time.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.839
This doctor told me
my metabolism's too high.

05:40.841 --> 05:43.342
I'd give anything
to be in that ring.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.044
Only way I'm gonna get
a pretty girl like you.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.113
Thanks.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.750
Yo, I'm... I'm Victor.

05:51.752 --> 05:52.951
She has a boyfriend.

05:52.953 --> 05:54.586
Well, technically,
Sam's not my boyfriend.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.355
Friend with benefits?

05:56.357 --> 05:57.689
I don't... I don't know, okay?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.558
I'm just gonna...
Figure things out.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.760
Take it a day a time.
You know what I mean, Victor?

06:01.762 --> 06:03.662
I can't even get a date.

06:05.000 --> 06:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:16.377 --> 06:19.544
Hey, that's an illegal move,
ref! He's choking him!

06:19.546 --> 06:23.081
Look, look! Look at the chains.
He's choking him!

06:23.083 --> 06:24.783
Disqualified!

06:24.785 --> 06:26.618
Disqualified!

06:31.492 --> 06:32.824
Whoa!

06:34.661 --> 06:37.028
All right, we're outta here.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.899
Put your hands around your head.

06:40.901 --> 06:43.468
Anyone comes at you,
knee to the crotch.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.875
Shannon!

06:51.011 --> 06:52.677
Watch out!

06:56.049 --> 06:57.482
Victor!

06:57.484 --> 06:58.917
Victor? You okay?

06:58.919 --> 07:01.453
Try to breathe.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.523
Shannon, call 9-1-1.

07:24.178 --> 07:26.078
What do you got?
Female, 20s.

07:26.079 --> 07:27.979
Traumatic c-spine injury.
She's moving all extremities.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.548
Tender to palpitation over
her second vertebrae.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.483
What does that mean?
Am I gonna be paralyzed?

07:31.485 --> 07:33.652
We're gonna do some tests,
okay? Can you tell me your name?

07:33.654 --> 07:34.820
Emilia.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.521
Please, I have to be able
to walk. Please.

07:36.523 --> 07:37.856
What's going on?
We got a c2 fracture.

07:37.858 --> 07:40.025
Let's get some portable
c-spine films here.

07:40.027 --> 07:41.577
Yeah, if it's unstable
and she moves,

07:41.578 --> 07:43.128
she can cut her own spine
and lose the ability to breathe.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.130
I saw this in Bagram.
It can go bad fast.

07:45.132 --> 07:47.999
Shannon, can you page ortho?
We need Dr. Williams right now.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.602
Got it.
Okay, on my count. 3, 2, 1.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.706
Let's roll her.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.425
Okay, it's gonna be a while

07:57.426 --> 07:58.742
till the on-call orthopod
can get here.

07:58.745 --> 08:00.629
Can you handle this till then?

08:00.630 --> 08:02.514
Yeah. Emilia, I'm Dr. Alister.
I'm gonna help you, all right?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.483
I'm really scared.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.818
I know. I'm gonna do
everything I can for you.

08:06.820 --> 08:10.155
Mid radial fracture, closed.
Possible broken lower ribs.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.256
Give him 100 of fentanyl

08:11.258 --> 08:12.991
and order a ct
to look at his liver.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.960
All right, buddy.
We're gonna take a look inside

08:14.962 --> 08:16.528
and make sure
nothing's bleeding.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.830
Jordan, are you gonna be here
when I get back, babe?

08:18.832 --> 08:20.899
Ah, you're my patient, honey,
I'm not going anywhere.

08:20.901 --> 08:23.869
Well, what do you want me
to tell Dr. Zia?

08:23.871 --> 08:26.805
You're three sheets to the wind?
I don't know what that means.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.206
Oh, you're wasted.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.742
A whole bottle of red wine.
Mm-hmm.

08:30.744 --> 08:32.611
Yeah, you should probably
go to sleep.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.778
Little tip... prop up your head

08:33.780 --> 08:36.164
so you don't choke on
your own vomit.

08:36.164 --> 08:37.494
Douche. What part of
"on-call" doesn't

08:37.518 --> 08:38.549
he get?

08:38.552 --> 08:41.052
Hey. Hey, I thought you were
going to, like,

08:41.054 --> 08:42.254
a wrestling match or something?

08:42.256 --> 08:45.090
Lucha libre.
Brawl broke out in the crowd.

08:45.092 --> 08:48.260
Oh, whoa. You... you take a hit?
I hope no black eye or anything.

08:48.262 --> 08:52.531
No, just a black soul.
Don't you have any patients?

08:52.533 --> 08:54.065
Uh, no, not yet.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.202
Surgeons really
have it easy, huh?

08:57.204 --> 08:59.905
What? Why would...
Why would you even say that?

08:59.907 --> 09:02.240
'Cause you're just
sitting around.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.675
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

09:03.677 --> 09:05.544
I'm... uh,
I'm not sitting around.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.879
Basically, it's just, like,
a slow night in surgery.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.848
Mm-hmm.
And I almost forgot.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.951
I have a post-op check
on one of Scott's patients.

09:12.953 --> 09:16.555
So I'm gonna... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go do that. Um...

09:20.027 --> 09:22.294
Man, you really
don't like Paul, do you?

09:22.296 --> 09:24.963
I do. He just... he takes
himself so seriously.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.699
The guy needs to lighten up.

09:29.836 --> 09:31.937
So why can't he take
his mask off?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.139
He can't reveal his identity.

09:34.141 --> 09:35.840
Okay...

09:35.842 --> 09:39.044
So why is he still wearing
his leotard and cape?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.246
That I can't answer.
Ah.

09:41.248 --> 09:44.749
Oh, my god. It's <i> El matador.</i>

09:44.751 --> 09:46.585
He's my favorite.

09:46.587 --> 09:48.653
Did he do
his Montezuma's revenge move?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.989
Yeah.
Oh!

09:50.991 --> 09:52.357
You like wrestling, Heather?

09:52.359 --> 09:54.960
Like it? Love it.

09:54.962 --> 09:58.096
Maybe he'll give me
an autograph.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.933
Okay, um, could you do me
a favor

10:01.935 --> 10:04.169
and drag <i> El matador</i> away
from his adoring fans

10:04.171 --> 10:05.704
so he could cheer up his cousin?

10:05.706 --> 10:06.838
I'll get him some scrubs.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.006
Thank you.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.674
Such a weird night.

10:12.846 --> 10:15.246
Son of a bitch.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.986
Did... did the air conditioner
just stop?

10:20.988 --> 10:22.954
Yep.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.723
And I just wanna go
on the record,

10:24.725 --> 10:26.825
I had the night off.

10:35.836 --> 10:38.103
I feel awful.

10:38.105 --> 10:39.304
It's so hot in here.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.373
Yeah. Ac's broken.

10:41.375 --> 10:43.108
I'll get you some more
ice packs.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.878
So your viral panel
and urinalysis

10:46.880 --> 10:48.814
came back negative,

10:48.815 --> 10:50.749
but now we got vomiting
to add to your symptoms.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.818
Huh. I have a horrible
headache while you're at it.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.655
Hmm. Might be time
for a spinal tap.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.273
I prefer a beer on tap,

10:58.274 --> 11:00.074
but something tells me
that's not on the menu.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.681
She's got

11:05.682 --> 11:07.399
an anterior/dislocation
fracture of the dens.

11:07.401 --> 11:09.401
Surgery's precarious.

11:09.403 --> 11:12.170
Right. Well, she's
neurologically intact.

11:12.172 --> 11:15.106
Can't we just decompress
the spine with traction?

11:15.108 --> 11:16.908
Yeah. You get ahold
of Dr. Williams?

11:16.910 --> 11:18.777
We...
We got ahold of him,

11:18.779 --> 11:20.378
but he can't get ahold
of himself.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.848
Man has a little problem
with alcohol.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.785
Okay, well, Syd, the orthopod
I worked with in Bagram,

11:26.787 --> 11:29.320
she was amazing.
I learned a lot from her.

11:29.322 --> 11:32.991
I can set up traction by myself.
I did a few back in country.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.761
Okay.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.697
Okay, I'll help you put her
in Gardner-Wells tongs.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.699
Okay.

11:40.701 --> 11:43.968
Emilia, okay, this contraption
is gonna look a little scary,

11:43.970 --> 11:45.870
but it's gonna help, okay?

11:45.872 --> 11:47.372
You just need to be very still.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.707
Okay.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.711
What if this doesn't work?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.749
If I can't walk,
then I can't work,

11:57.751 --> 11:59.784
and then I can't pay
for college.

11:59.786 --> 12:03.254
College. That's great.
What are you studying?

12:05.374 --> 12:07.491
I'm in business school.
I wanna be a sports agent.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.829
I'm not just some dumb girl
in a bikini.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.130
No one thinks that.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.132
Lots of people do.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.835
I'm only 21.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.170
And what happens if I end up
in a wheelchair?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.340
You won't.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.843
I promise you're gonna
walk out of here.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.783
You're just gonna feel
a little bit of pressure.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.327
It's hot in here, too, huh?
Yeah.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.895
So how you feeling, Victor?

12:43.897 --> 12:47.165
<i>Better after the pain shot.</i>

12:47.167 --> 12:49.834
Hey, thank you for looking out
for me earlier.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.537
<i>I had to get in the way</i>
<i>of danger,</i> princesa.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.873
<i>Gotta protect that
beautiful face of yours.</i>

12:54.875 --> 12:57.142
You don't give up, do you?

12:57.144 --> 12:59.043
<i>I hope someone was recording it</i>

12:59.045 --> 13:01.379
<i>so the league can see
that I can take a hit.</i>

13:01.381 --> 13:04.983
<i>I got stealth moves, like a cat.</i>

13:04.985 --> 13:06.184
El Gato.

13:06.186 --> 13:09.988
I would root for <i> El Gato.</i>

13:09.990 --> 13:13.224
Okay, Victor, so it looks like
you have a small laceration

13:13.226 --> 13:15.260
on your liver from a broken rib,

13:15.262 --> 13:18.396
and a small... Cyst

13:18.398 --> 13:21.366
which is probably
a benign adenoma.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.285
<i>What's that?</i>

13:23.286 --> 13:25.203
It's a tumor formed
from epithelial tissue.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.972
Don't worry. Don't worry.

13:27.974 --> 13:29.440
You don't have cancer.
You're fine.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.011
So, um, what we're gonna do is
we're gonna fix up your arm.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.947
But I'd like to keep you
overnight

13:35.949 --> 13:37.816
to observe that laceration,
okay?

13:37.818 --> 13:39.517
<i>Yeah, you can keep me
overnight, girl.</i>

13:39.519 --> 13:41.886
All right.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.822
I called the day shift orthopod

13:43.824 --> 13:46.090
to come in and take a look
at Emilia.

13:49.095 --> 13:53.298
You think you went too far
with that promise to her?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.234
Maybe I shouldn't have
promised her,

13:56.236 --> 13:57.468
but I've just seen too many
21 year olds

13:57.470 --> 13:59.337
end up in permanent wheelchairs.

13:59.339 --> 14:02.040
I'm not ready
to see another one.

14:04.978 --> 14:08.513
You know, um, we haven't really
had a chance to... to talk

14:08.515 --> 14:11.382
since you got back
to civilization.

14:11.384 --> 14:13.251
How you... how you doing?

14:14.921 --> 14:17.055
Some days are a little rocky.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.523
Swerving under bridges,

14:18.525 --> 14:21.593
hoping someone doesn't drop
an IED on my truck.

14:21.595 --> 14:24.629
That kind of fun stuff.

14:24.631 --> 14:28.132
You know, when I got back
from my first tour,

14:28.134 --> 14:31.069
I asked our gardener
to move the shrubs

14:31.071 --> 14:33.037
from the back of the house
to the front.

14:33.039 --> 14:35.607
I thought I could create
a plant barrier...

14:36.977 --> 14:40.011
Against outside elements.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.613
Right, probably 'cause,
you know,

14:41.615 --> 14:44.082
a shrub will protect you
from a pipe bomb, right?

14:44.084 --> 14:45.851
Totally rational.

14:45.852 --> 14:47.652
Something's wrong
with your patient. Hurry up.

14:49.556 --> 14:50.922
I can't feel my legs!

14:50.924 --> 14:53.424
I can't feel my legs!
Please help me!

14:53.426 --> 14:55.260
I can't feel my legs!

14:55.262 --> 14:57.095
You promised me!

14:57.097 --> 14:58.621
Traction didn't work.
She needs surgery now.

14:58.645 --> 14:59.297
I'll get Scott.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.133
Go, go, go!

15:02.135 --> 15:04.469
Emilia, everything is
gonna be okay.

15:04.471 --> 15:06.971
That's what you said before.

15:13.980 --> 15:15.580
I need to manually reduce
the fragment fracture

15:15.582 --> 15:17.181
and screw it in place.

15:17.183 --> 15:20.051
Day shift orthopod
hasn't called back.

15:20.053 --> 15:22.253
I'm not a spinal surgeon, drew,
and neither are you.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.489
This is pretty risky.
Yeah, well, we're not waiting.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.459
If we do nothing,
she's paralyzed.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.227
In the war zone, you do
a little bit of everything.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.396
You don't wait around
for the on-call guy.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.631
I can do this.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.300
Topher, thoughts?

15:37.437 --> 15:41.172
Well, drew worked
with an ace ortho at Bagram.

15:41.174 --> 15:45.977
He says he's done
spinal surgery before.

15:45.979 --> 15:48.947
I trust he knows what
he's doing.

15:48.949 --> 15:51.115
All right.

15:51.117 --> 15:53.217
Drew, this is your show now.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.954
I will assist.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.722
Patient sedated and ready.

15:59.526 --> 16:02.593
One wrong move, and we can
take out her spinal cord.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.595
Not gonna happen.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.720
I swear there's a bicep
in there somewhere.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.205
Ah, it's in there, okay?

16:30.206 --> 16:31.689
You wouldn't be able to move
your arm if it wasn't.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.291
Vic, you wanna build
some muscle, man?

16:33.293 --> 16:34.926
You gotta up your protein.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.560
I already drink, like,
two protein shakes a day.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.429
I know, but you eat
way too much fat.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.315
Your diet's all messed up.

16:40.316 --> 16:42.200
You should've seen this guy
when we were touring in Mexico.

16:42.202 --> 16:44.535
He hit up every taco stand you could find.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.471
Carnitas day and night.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.172
Some people have
a high metabolism.

16:48.174 --> 16:51.242
Sometimes it's lifestyle
and sometimes it's genetics.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.444
I guess I just didn't get
the genes.

16:53.446 --> 16:55.713
I just wish I was
more like my cousin.

16:55.715 --> 16:59.417
Strong, intimidating, a winner.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.686
All right. Okay,
so she's ready to shoot.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.254
Let's go stand over here.

17:06.059 --> 17:08.792
You never take that mask off
in public?

17:08.795 --> 17:12.396
No, especially if
I got fans following me around.

17:12.398 --> 17:16.300
Used to wrestle under
a different name.

17:16.301 --> 17:19.069
<i>El diablo.</i>

17:21.608 --> 17:23.641
You never heard of me?

17:23.643 --> 17:27.310
I'm sorry. I am...
I'm a lucha libre newbie.

17:27.313 --> 17:30.615
Oh. Well, the people hated me,
and I didn't like it.

17:30.617 --> 17:33.351
So, uh, I laid low for a minute,
reinvented myself.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.686
Hmm. Sounds like something
I just did, you know?

17:35.688 --> 17:38.156
Went on a sabbatical,
disappeared for a while.

17:38.158 --> 17:40.691
Hey. Hey, hey.

17:43.096 --> 17:44.562
You're okay. You're okay.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.064
Excuse me. Excuse me.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.799
All right, let's do an AP lap
of his chest,

17:47.801 --> 17:50.201
and page rt
for a breathing treatment.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.504
All right. Breathe.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.146
Oh, man.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.515
Hey, Heather,
it's the last bag of ice.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.150
Thank you.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.784
Every bed is taken
with a heat stroke patient.

18:07.787 --> 18:11.355
Can't get a repair man here
for another two hours.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.291
But never mind that.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.760
I'm Dr. Zia.

18:15.761 --> 18:18.228
Hi. Normally, I like to
stand up when I meet new people,

18:18.231 --> 18:20.465
but there's a needle in my back.

18:20.467 --> 18:21.766
I-I see that.

18:21.768 --> 18:25.470
Fever and a rash,
headache, vomiting.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.737
Blood work is clean.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.272
Meningitis.

18:28.274 --> 18:29.507
Yeah, sounds like it.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.275
I don't know if
it's bacterial or viral.

18:31.277 --> 18:32.376
Let's hope it's the latter.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.611
Yeah, we should isolate her

18:33.613 --> 18:35.646
and start her on antibiotics
just in case.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.482
Isolate me?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.183
No, it's just a precaution.

18:39.185 --> 18:42.286
You know, Georgia here is
training to do a tough mudder.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.421
Dr. Zia's trying to get
in shape.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.789
Perhaps you could give him
some pointers.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.892
Oh, thanks. I-i got it covered.
Really?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.894
Yeah, doc, you look
a little scrawny to me.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.562
Listen, two months ago,

18:51.564 --> 18:53.164
I couldn't run
for seven minutes.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.499
Now I can run for 7 miles.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.051
That's pretty good.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.602
But let me guess...
You hit a plateau.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.303
Come on, give me a break.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.240
I just quit smoking,
my mother lives with me.

19:02.242 --> 19:04.842
Oh. You definitely get
a pass.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.749
Uh, can you send that up
to micro?

19:11.751 --> 19:13.417
I'm gonna get
the isolation room started.

19:13.419 --> 19:14.652
Okay, thanks.

19:14.654 --> 19:16.787
Georgia,
back in a couple minutes.

19:19.893 --> 19:22.360
Hey, hey.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.595
You okay?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.464
Yeah, I, uh,
I just brought a girl in

19:26.466 --> 19:28.633
from the halfway house.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.801
Drying out from, uh, heroin
and a heat wave don't mix.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.204
You want me to take a look
at her?

19:33.206 --> 19:36.274
No, she's just dehydrated.
Kenny's giving her fluids.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.409
I'm gonna grab something from
the cafeteria and head out.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.610
I'll see you later.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.096
Okay.

19:44.584 --> 19:45.750
Pfft. What...

19:45.752 --> 19:47.618
What... what are you
doing here?

19:47.620 --> 19:49.320
I have an ENT who's using
a new laser.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.755
I had to give him
a refresher course.

19:50.757 --> 19:53.558
My job is getting old.

19:53.560 --> 19:55.960
I need to find something
more challenging.

19:55.962 --> 19:59.764
Mmm, any chance you can
sneak away?

19:59.766 --> 20:01.966
I just need you for
5, 10 minutes tops.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.436
Yeah, I wish, but...
I got a patient.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.971
Oh.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.508
Well, if you change your mind...

20:10.510 --> 20:13.911
There is nothing between
me and these pants.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.346
Nothing.

20:23.289 --> 20:24.305
I don't need that.

20:24.306 --> 20:25.322
Doc, my cousin's had this cough
for the last few weeks.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.258
He went on antibiotics twice
and they didn't work.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.993
Yeah, I heard him coughing
at the match.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.530
It could be bronchitis
or asthma.

20:32.532 --> 20:33.864
Okay.

20:33.866 --> 20:35.967
Victor, your X-ray patterns
are suggestive of Tb.

20:35.969 --> 20:37.619
We're gonna have to get you

20:37.620 --> 20:39.270
and anyone else who was
on that tour tested.

20:39.272 --> 20:41.272
That means you, too,<i> matador.</i>
Are you serious?

20:41.274 --> 20:42.907
I'm always serious. Shouldn't we
isolate both of them?

20:42.909 --> 20:44.409
Yeah, but where?

20:44.410 --> 20:45.910
Okay, T.C. already has a patient
in isolation.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.412
And if this is a bunch of people
with tuberculosis,

20:48.414 --> 20:51.015
we are screwed.

20:51.016 --> 20:53.617
How does a ring girl get
messed up instead of a wrestler?

20:53.620 --> 20:56.420
Removing a piece of lamina.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.725
Oh, damn.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.294
Clot and bone fragments
are blocking our access.

21:03.296 --> 21:04.495
Yeah.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.664
All right, let's get it
all cleaned out.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.301
It's gonna take too long
to clear all this out.

21:10.303 --> 21:14.538
Any delay with this heat,
too risky.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.307
Chance of infection's too high.

21:16.309 --> 21:19.310
We need another way in.

21:20.713 --> 21:22.546
I can go through the mouth.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.949
We can bypass the debris
and cut the OR time in half.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.784
Through the mouth?

21:26.786 --> 21:28.419
Have you done that before?

21:28.421 --> 21:29.854
I assisted in
the exact same procedure

21:29.856 --> 21:31.439
on a corporal in Bagram.

21:31.440 --> 21:33.023
He had a piece of shrapnel
lodged on his second vertebrae.

21:33.026 --> 21:35.326
And it worked?
Yeah.

21:35.328 --> 21:37.428
I'm not gonna lie.
It's pretty tricky.

21:37.430 --> 21:41.065
But if we don't, this girl
will never walk again.

21:45.672 --> 21:47.772
Well, you army docs do stuff
on the battlefield

21:47.774 --> 21:49.874
every day that we've never
tried around here.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.777
Let's do it.

21:54.747 --> 21:56.414
Okay.

21:56.416 --> 22:01.786
Just remind me never to promise
a patient anything ever again.

22:12.365 --> 22:14.048
Okay, I need you to check

22:14.049 --> 22:15.732
every person in that waiting
room who was on that tour

22:15.735 --> 22:17.668
who has Tb symptoms.
Okay.

22:17.670 --> 22:18.936
Hey.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.005
So I saw something
you should know about,

22:21.007 --> 22:22.673
but you'll be happy
you didn't see it.

22:22.675 --> 22:25.042
T.C.'s hooking up
with that new drug rep,

22:25.044 --> 22:28.412
the one with the $600 stilettos
and Ducati.

22:28.414 --> 22:31.549
Uh... That's great.

22:31.551 --> 22:34.051
I'm... I'm happy for him.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.954
Hmm.

22:36.956 --> 22:38.089
You know,
you shouldn't gossip so much.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.523
You never know
if it's gonna come back

22:39.525 --> 22:41.692
and bite you in the ass.
I wasn't gossiping.

22:41.694 --> 22:44.362
This is all about sisterhood.
I thought you'd wanna know.

22:44.364 --> 22:45.713
Well, thank you.

22:45.714 --> 22:47.063
But, uh, let's keep it
between the two of us, okay?

22:47.066 --> 22:49.467
And you have a patient.

22:50.503 --> 22:52.536
82-year-old female
with heat exhaustion

22:52.538 --> 22:54.905
and syncope... whoa.
What's going on in here?

22:54.907 --> 22:56.640
Dante's nine circles of hell.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.875
Should you guys still
be taking patients?

22:57.877 --> 22:59.143
Topher's call.

23:01.714 --> 23:02.880
Hey.

23:02.882 --> 23:04.014
Hey.

23:04.016 --> 23:05.683
I thought you had the night off.

23:05.685 --> 23:08.819
I did until the audience decided
to join in on the fighting

23:08.821 --> 23:11.989
and a crazy fan tried
to kick me in the head.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.625
Well, I'm glad you weren't
kicked in the head.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.460
Yeah, me, too.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.763
Here, you might need this.

23:18.765 --> 23:22.400
Oh. That's... Sweet.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.743
Okay, okay. All right, I...

23:32.745 --> 23:35.012
I'm at work. Gotta go.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.683
Think T.C. knows about
those two?

23:39.685 --> 23:43.554
I-I didn't know, so I-i doubt
he has any idea.

23:43.556 --> 23:44.889
Not sure how he's gonna take it.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.425
Oh, he's a big boy.
He can handle it.

23:47.427 --> 23:48.859
Yeah.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.561
Well, I didn't see nothing.

23:52.165 --> 23:55.633
I didn't... oh! I didn't see...
No, man.

23:55.635 --> 23:57.719
Are you okay?

23:57.720 --> 23:59.804
Yeah, I just got a cramp
in my... my glute.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.139
Ah! Whoa.

24:02.141 --> 24:03.841
What, uh...
So speaking of muscles,

24:03.843 --> 24:06.610
how's... how's your
bike training been going?

24:06.612 --> 24:09.480
I did 40 minutes on
the stationary bike yesterday.

24:09.482 --> 24:11.749
Hey, tomorrow, I'm taking you
outside on the terrain.

24:11.751 --> 24:13.918
All right? Stay hydrated.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.720
Thank you.

24:19.525 --> 24:20.658
Oh, man.

24:20.660 --> 24:22.193
Hey, uh, Topher.

24:22.195 --> 24:24.362
Hello, Sam.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.530
Should we be rerouting patients
to another hospital?

24:26.532 --> 24:29.200
Uh... I called St. Luke's.
They're just as slammed.

24:29.202 --> 24:31.602
Could you and a couple of
your guys bring as much ice

24:31.604 --> 24:33.404
as you can get your hands on?

24:33.405 --> 24:35.205
If you have any extra fans at
the station, bring those, too.

24:35.208 --> 24:36.974
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.

24:41.881 --> 24:45.783
I, uh, I have your patie...
I-i have your labs.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.017
You're a lab tech now?

24:47.019 --> 24:49.119
No wonder you couldn't hack
the ER.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.689
I was... I was coming
to check on...

24:51.691 --> 24:54.925
You know what? Do you want your
patient's Tb results or not?

24:54.927 --> 24:58.229
'Cause... They're negative.

24:58.231 --> 25:00.181
So I'm good, right?

25:00.182 --> 25:02.132
We'll still send this off in
case it was a false negative.

25:02.134 --> 25:03.267
Anything else?

25:03.269 --> 25:04.702
Maybe you'd like to
pull up a chair,

25:04.704 --> 25:05.936
play some "farm heroes"
on your phone?

25:05.938 --> 25:08.272
What...

25:08.274 --> 25:09.640
Okay.
Help him!

25:09.642 --> 25:10.774
Jordan!

25:13.913 --> 25:15.779
Okay, I need an ultrasound.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.047
Okay, all right.

25:22.989 --> 25:24.189
His liver's bleeding.
Let's get him to the OR.

25:24.213 --> 25:24.588
All right.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.992
Looks like you got
your first patient.

25:27.994 --> 25:30.127
Cousin!
I'm praying for you, man.

25:30.129 --> 25:32.129
He has a cyst on his liver
near the bleeding.

25:32.131 --> 25:34.181
It could complicate surgery.

25:34.182 --> 25:36.232
Paul, take care of this guy,
okay? He's special.

25:36.235 --> 25:38.802
I heard that.
You're in good hands, Victor.

25:38.804 --> 25:40.104
I already was.

25:40.106 --> 25:42.873
Scott's in OR 2. Grab him.
OR 2.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.013
Okay, Scott, I got my finger
on the anterior tubercle.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.881
Grab it carefully with a kocher.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.883
And pull volar traction.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.318
Exactly.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.921
Okay, once that's aligned,

25:56.923 --> 25:59.156
I'll place an odontoid screw.

25:59.158 --> 26:03.060
Dr. Clemmens? You're needed
in OR 1 immediately.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.566
Don't worry, Scott.
I got this.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.869
If you need me,
I'm 30 seconds away.

26:11.871 --> 26:14.672
All right, nurse. Hold traction.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.651
Hey, what are you doing here?
Hi.

26:27.653 --> 26:29.653
Oh, I brought in someone
from the halfway house.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.088
Kenny told me
I'd find you up here.

26:31.090 --> 26:33.057
Yeah.
Um, I have your wallet.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.926
Oh, you could've
given this to me later.

26:35.928 --> 26:40.030
I know. I just... I'm
being kind of silly.

26:40.032 --> 26:42.066
I kind of wanted
to see you again.

26:42.068 --> 26:44.268
I'm really happy to see you.
But I'm running into surgery.

26:44.270 --> 26:45.836
So why don't you
pick me up later

26:45.838 --> 26:46.971
and we'll go have breakfast?

26:46.973 --> 26:49.306
Okay.
Good?

26:59.051 --> 27:01.118
Jordan. Hi.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.787
Hi.

27:03.789 --> 27:05.689
Scott and I just started dating.

27:05.691 --> 27:07.858
I see that.

27:07.860 --> 27:11.328
It's very new. We... we haven't
told anybody yet.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.831
So does that mean T.C.
doesn't know?

27:13.833 --> 27:16.834
I... I kind of wanted
to wait and see

27:16.836 --> 27:18.802
where things were going first.

27:18.804 --> 27:23.841
But... I guess it looks like
it's going someplace good.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.911
Okay.

27:36.255 --> 27:38.989
Hey. Brought you another fan.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.659
Oh, point it right at my face.

27:41.661 --> 27:45.696
Georgia, your cerebrospinal
fluid was positive.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.098
I have meningitis?
Yeah.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.299
We're not sure what kind yet

27:49.301 --> 27:51.001
'cause the cultures haven't
come back.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.137
So hopefully, it's just viral
and it'll go... go away.

27:53.139 --> 27:55.906
You okay?
My chest hurts.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.908
I can't breathe.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.278
What's going on?
She's having a heart attack.

28:01.280 --> 28:04.081
I'll page cardiology.
All right.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.150
That's it. That's it.
Okay.

28:19.098 --> 28:21.098
How's Victor's surgery going?

28:21.100 --> 28:23.100
We're almost done here.

28:24.437 --> 28:27.371
Repaired the lacerated liver
and removed the cyst.

28:27.373 --> 28:30.407
Blood pressure's down to 72 systolic.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.377
- He must be bleeding somewhere.
- The field looks dry.

28:33.379 --> 28:34.745
Did you check behind the liver?

28:34.747 --> 28:36.447
Yes. I did already.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.148
He's down to 58, guys.

28:38.150 --> 28:41.051
We're gonna lose him.

28:45.191 --> 28:46.924
Cardiology has somebody
in the Cath lab,

28:46.926 --> 28:48.092
but she'll be next.

28:48.094 --> 28:50.194
Just started heparin
and a nitro drip.

28:50.196 --> 28:53.063
We're missing something.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.932
Meningitis doesn't cause
heart attacks.

28:54.934 --> 28:56.967
Unless the same virus is
attacking the heart.

28:56.969 --> 28:59.369
But her viral panel was normal.

29:01.440 --> 29:04.141
Topher. Look at the skin
on her hands.

29:04.143 --> 29:06.477
What the hell?
It's peeling off.

29:06.479 --> 29:07.911
Yeah.

29:15.020 --> 29:18.455
Conjunctivitis, skin shedding,

29:18.457 --> 29:20.224
strawberry tongue.

29:20.226 --> 29:21.826
This is Kawasaki disease.

29:21.827 --> 29:23.427
The diffuse inflammatory
reaction could explain

29:23.429 --> 29:25.162
the multiple symptoms.

29:25.163 --> 29:26.896
Yeah, and it causes aneurysms
of the coronary arteries,

29:26.899 --> 29:29.200
which would explain
the heart attack.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.502
Forget cardiology. Take her to
the OR for bypass surgery.

29:31.504 --> 29:32.970
I'll take her right away.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.175
Crit is stable.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.343
So he's not bleeding.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.779
Levophed is maxed out.
It's not working.

29:41.781 --> 29:43.247
Maybe he's septic?

29:43.249 --> 29:45.116
No, white count
and temperature are normal.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.984
Could be an adrenal issue.
Let's put the films back up.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.419
Okay, hold on a second. Um...

29:49.421 --> 29:51.522
All right, he was traveling
in Mexico for about a month.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.090
And his cousin said he was
eating pork

29:53.092 --> 29:54.332
like it was going out of style.

29:57.029 --> 29:58.262
Parasites?

29:58.264 --> 30:00.931
Hand me the specimen container
with the cyst.

30:06.205 --> 30:08.372
Look at those suckers.
Unbelievable.

30:08.374 --> 30:10.040
He's in anaphylactic shock
from the parasites

30:10.042 --> 30:11.208
pouring into his abdomen.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.526
He's crashing.

30:12.527 --> 30:13.843
We gotta stop this
reaction. We gotta irrigate.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.212
Hand me an epi now.

30:16.415 --> 30:19.449
We're in.

30:23.189 --> 30:24.555
BP's up.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.557
That was close.

30:26.559 --> 30:28.425
It was too close.

30:28.427 --> 30:32.462
All right. Nice work, Paul.
You good to close?

30:32.464 --> 30:34.064
Yep.

30:37.903 --> 30:41.505
<i>Code blue,
code blue. Room 359.</i>

30:41.507 --> 30:43.440
<i>Code blue. Room 359.</i>

30:43.442 --> 30:46.476
Hey. What's going on?

30:46.478 --> 30:48.445
I could be hallucinating
from the heat,

30:48.447 --> 30:50.180
but I think drew's doing
a spinal surgery

30:50.182 --> 30:51.615
through a patient's mouth.

30:51.617 --> 30:54.918
The mouth?

30:54.920 --> 30:57.054
Where'd he learn how to do that?

30:57.056 --> 31:00.090
It's the major that he worked
with during his last deployment.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.492
She made a real impression.

31:02.494 --> 31:05.596
- Guess our little boy's growing up.
- I guess so.

31:05.598 --> 31:09.066
How's Georgia?
So far so good.

31:09.068 --> 31:12.536
Uh, surgeon thinks we got it
in time.

31:12.538 --> 31:16.073
Heat wave ended up
saving her life.

31:16.075 --> 31:21.445
You know the... The fireman, Sam?
Mm.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.113
Jordan's seeing him.

31:25.351 --> 31:30.120
I didn't want you to hear it
from one of the nurses.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.589
Seems like a nice guy.

31:34.226 --> 31:37.494
I-I moved on.
I want her to be happy.

31:41.500 --> 31:44.368
You really moved on?

31:46.038 --> 31:48.372
Mm-hmm.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.307
Hardest thing I've ever done.

31:58.183 --> 32:00.584
Hydatid cyst. It's crazy.

32:00.586 --> 32:02.586
Haven't seen one of those
since residency.

32:02.588 --> 32:04.655
Yeah, well, thanks for
pulling out all the stops.

32:04.657 --> 32:08.392
Hey, whatever you wanna say,

32:08.394 --> 32:10.427
just say it, Jordan.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.964
I think you're making
a huge mistake

32:13.966 --> 32:15.399
getting involved with Annie.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.402
Oh, do you?
Yes.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.237
I know that she is sober

32:20.239 --> 32:23.240
and she is trying to be
a better person,

32:23.242 --> 32:26.410
but I have seen her go down
that path a hundred times before

32:26.412 --> 32:28.645
and it never works out.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.114
So you're an expert
on all things Annie?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.650
I've known the woman
for 10 years.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.019
Okay? She stole from T.C.

32:36.021 --> 32:38.155
Yeah, and she came back,

32:38.157 --> 32:40.157
and she's been trying
to make it up to him.

32:40.159 --> 32:42.426
Do you have any idea how hard
that was for her to do?

32:47.099 --> 32:49.099
She makes me happy, Jordan.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.438
For now.

32:57.309 --> 33:02.279
I'm just worried she's going
to break your heart.

33:02.281 --> 33:05.182
Well, you don't have to be
a recovering alcoholic

33:05.184 --> 33:08.085
to break somebody's heart.

33:23.602 --> 33:25.635
Hi, Emilia.

33:25.637 --> 33:27.637
I'm Dr. Clemmens.

33:27.639 --> 33:30.040
I assisted Dr. Alister
in your surgery.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.608
Hi.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.778
Can you try something for me?

33:34.780 --> 33:37.714
Can you try wiggling
your fingers?

33:44.123 --> 33:46.556
What about your left hand?

33:50.229 --> 33:52.162
Okay, uh...

33:54.266 --> 33:57.567
Your toes?

33:57.569 --> 34:00.537
I can feel that.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.276
I think that deserves a yay.

34:06.278 --> 34:09.146
Yay.
Oh, I was...

34:09.148 --> 34:10.547
You meant from her?
Yeah.

34:12.351 --> 34:15.152
With a little rest and rehab,
you'll be good as new.

34:15.154 --> 34:18.355
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

34:21.326 --> 34:23.427
How are you feeling?

34:23.429 --> 34:26.263
Little out of it,
but the pain is better, though.

34:26.264 --> 34:28.764
But you're never gonna eat pork
again. I know I'm not.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.168
Oh, hey.

34:32.170 --> 34:34.538
There's the best doctor
in San Antonio.

34:34.540 --> 34:36.806
And the cutest.

34:36.809 --> 34:38.692
No offense.

34:38.693 --> 34:40.576
Oh, it's okay. I'm saving
myself for the one.

34:40.579 --> 34:43.780
Well, obviously,
someone is feeling better.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.715
Hmm.
Okay, Victor,

34:45.717 --> 34:47.851
you are going to have to take
an anti-parasitic pill

34:47.853 --> 34:52.121
for the next few weeks, but you
should make a full recovery.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.391
So the parasite's
giving him that cough?

34:54.393 --> 34:57.094
Yeah, he had an autoimmune
response to the parasite

34:57.096 --> 34:59.362
which caused areas of swelling
in his lungs.

34:59.364 --> 35:01.465
And, Victor,
that parasite in there

35:01.467 --> 35:03.467
is why you couldn't gain weight.

35:03.469 --> 35:06.169
Awesome. So I could put on
some muscle now?

35:06.171 --> 35:08.271
Yes. Yes, you can.

35:10.142 --> 35:12.275
Hey. Hey, doc.

35:12.277 --> 35:14.277
So what are the chances that

35:14.279 --> 35:16.880
Victor's ever gonna bulk up
like me?

35:18.617 --> 35:20.250
Slim.

35:20.252 --> 35:23.520
Uh, with his physiology,
it would take a lot of work.

35:23.522 --> 35:25.322
He wants to be a <i> Luchador</i>
so bad.

35:25.324 --> 35:27.324
And after everything
he's been through,

35:27.326 --> 35:30.160
I just... I wish there was
something we could do, you know,

35:30.162 --> 35:31.661
to make him feel like the man.

35:31.663 --> 35:34.898
You know what I mean?
Hmm.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.766
I have an idea.

35:36.768 --> 35:39.369
So my body's attacking itself?

35:39.371 --> 35:42.672
Yes, but this medication
will stop the process.

35:42.674 --> 35:43.907
And the surgeon said that

35:43.909 --> 35:45.809
the damage to your heart
was minimal.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.812
We, uh, we rarely see
this disease in adults.

35:48.814 --> 35:50.380
So I'm a freak of nature?

35:50.382 --> 35:52.382
Oh, I would say
you were special.

35:52.384 --> 35:54.264
Okay, can I still train
for the tough mudder?

35:54.920 --> 35:57.687
Because I can't go back
to sitting on my couch

35:57.689 --> 35:59.422
eating my own weight in Oreos.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.491
Well, you have to keep
a close eye on your heart,

36:01.493 --> 36:03.493
but it shouldn't stop you
from living your life.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.695
You can continue
to torment yourself

36:05.697 --> 36:09.599
with exercise
and clean eating and...

36:09.601 --> 36:12.569
Dr. Zia, you need to change
your mindset.

36:12.571 --> 36:15.572
Right, Toph. Once you make
a change, you never go back.

36:15.574 --> 36:17.674
Right.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.176
Hey.
Hi, Toph.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.510
Hey, T.C.
yeah?

36:20.512 --> 36:22.379
You got a minute?

36:22.381 --> 36:23.813
Sure. You all good?

36:23.815 --> 36:25.348
Yeah.
Okay.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.487
Yeah,<i> El matador.</i>

36:30.489 --> 36:32.422
I love you so much, <i>matador.</i>

36:32.424 --> 36:33.690
Will you sign my boob?

36:33.692 --> 36:34.958
All right.
Yeah!

36:34.960 --> 36:37.961
Okay,<i> El matador</i> needs his rest.

36:37.963 --> 36:42.666
Oh, man. That was the greatest
five minutes of my life.

36:42.668 --> 36:45.468
But... You could've let me
sign her boobies.

36:45.470 --> 36:47.470
Step too far, buddy.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.973
Thanks, Jordan.

36:51.977 --> 36:54.377
All clear?

36:55.747 --> 36:59.449
Wait. You're <i> El matador?</i>

36:59.451 --> 37:00.984
You're <i> El diablo.</i>

37:02.287 --> 37:04.287
Man, I hated you.

37:04.289 --> 37:06.423
You were the worst.

37:09.695 --> 37:12.629
You see? One good deed.

37:16.501 --> 37:19.703
Yeah, I understand if you're not
jumping for joy over this.

37:19.705 --> 37:20.904
But I swear to you,

37:20.906 --> 37:23.607
I have Annie's best interests
at heart.

37:23.609 --> 37:24.774
Hmm.

37:24.776 --> 37:27.744
And I know this is
probably weird for you

37:27.746 --> 37:30.513
or awkward or...

37:30.515 --> 37:32.716
A bunch of other adjectives,
I don't know.

37:32.718 --> 37:35.885
But I just wanted to tell you
myself, man to man.

37:37.990 --> 37:41.825
And hey, don't... try not to be
too hard on Annie

37:41.827 --> 37:43.860
for not telling you first.

37:43.861 --> 37:45.894
She was just really concerned
about how you'd react.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.832
She thinks of you
as her only family.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.367
Thanks, man.

37:58.644 --> 38:01.645
Epic save on
that c-spine trauma.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.381
Thank you.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.883
You know, we saw some
messed up things over there.

38:06.885 --> 38:09.052
At the end of the day,
makes us better doctors.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.991
I'm not moving.

38:14.993 --> 38:16.793
What...

38:18.930 --> 38:20.530
Did you poison it?

38:20.532 --> 38:21.965
I thought about it,

38:21.967 --> 38:23.800
but a woman using poison
as a murder weapon

38:23.802 --> 38:26.770
is so cliché.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.972
Nice job with Victor today.

38:28.974 --> 38:31.574
You know, it may not seem like
I do much around here,

38:31.576 --> 38:33.043
but surgeons are there

38:33.045 --> 38:35.345
when the stakes
are the highest. So...

38:35.347 --> 38:37.681
Yeah, I know.
Surgeons are kings.

38:37.683 --> 38:39.783
I-I don't know about kings.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.584
I mean, if Jordan hadn't been
there to help,

38:41.586 --> 38:43.987
we would've lost Victor.

38:43.988 --> 38:46.389
I-I'm just saying that when
we're together as a team,

38:46.391 --> 38:47.791
that's when we save lives.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.959
What I'm trying to impart
is that...

38:49.961 --> 38:51.695
Oh, my god.
Mmm.

38:51.697 --> 38:54.497
Oh... oh, my god.
Why would you do that?

38:54.499 --> 38:55.832
You said we're a team.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.967
I decided I liked yours better.

38:57.969 --> 39:00.704
You really have to loosen up,
Paul. You're so rigid.

39:00.706 --> 39:03.039
I'm not rigid.
That was... that was gross.

39:03.041 --> 39:03.632
Rigid. Rigid. Rigid.

39:03.657 --> 39:05.108
Okay, I just... this
this is my Popsicle.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.711
Sure,<i> now</i> it works.

39:09.781 --> 39:12.615
Hey.
No. No, no, no.

39:12.617 --> 39:14.718
What is...
Can I talk to you for a second?

39:14.720 --> 39:15.919
Yeah.

39:17.456 --> 39:19.489
Things are moving way too fast
with Sam.

39:19.491 --> 39:21.024
So about those dating apps
that you're using...

39:21.026 --> 39:23.393
- Mm-hmm.
- Um, can you tell me about them?

39:23.395 --> 39:24.561
Oh, I'll text you a list,

39:24.563 --> 39:25.995
but basically, here's the deal.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.098
Remember, it's a numbers game,

39:28.100 --> 39:29.733
so don't take anything
personally.

39:29.735 --> 39:31.601
And always swipe right
on the maybes

39:31.603 --> 39:33.536
'cause they may be hotter
in person.

39:33.538 --> 39:35.672
And also, only meet for coffee
or a drink,

39:35.674 --> 39:38.608
but make sure the bar has food
in case the guy doesn't suck.

39:38.610 --> 39:40.810
And if you don't wanna slip back
into serial monogamy,

39:40.812 --> 39:42.379
keep it to
a 2-date maximum.

39:42.381 --> 39:45.548
All right.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.650
Time for you to have
some fun, Jordan.

39:47.652 --> 39:50.687
Yeah. I couldn't agree more.

39:50.689 --> 39:51.821
See ya.

39:55.727 --> 39:58.495
So Kawasaki disease in an adult?

39:58.497 --> 40:01.631
Yeah. Hydatid liver cyst.

40:01.633 --> 40:03.166
This night was bananas
with a capital B.

40:03.168 --> 40:05.168
Yeah.

40:05.170 --> 40:07.804
So you and Sam?

40:07.806 --> 40:12.475
Yeah. Casual, you know,
taking it day by day.

40:12.477 --> 40:13.810
You and Jessica?

40:13.812 --> 40:16.079
For now.

40:16.081 --> 40:17.714
You know me.

40:17.716 --> 40:19.048
I do.

40:22.087 --> 40:23.853
So <i> that's</i> happening.

40:23.855 --> 40:27.624
Yeah. Annie and Scott.

40:27.626 --> 40:31.344
Yeah, he told me, man to man.

40:31.345 --> 40:32.928
Man to man, huh?
How do you feel about it?

40:32.931 --> 40:34.864
Oh, I hated it.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.900
He's arrogant, egotistical.
Well, hold on.

40:36.902 --> 40:38.668
You know, I used to date
the guy.

40:38.670 --> 40:40.503
He happens to be
a really great guy.

40:40.505 --> 40:43.072
Annie, however, is a walking
therapy session.

40:43.074 --> 40:46.142
Oh, that's my family
you're talking about.

40:46.144 --> 40:48.945
All right, so she's not
the most stable. But who is?

40:48.947 --> 40:50.647
She stole your TV.

40:50.649 --> 40:52.081
Gave me an excuse
to buy a new one.

40:52.083 --> 40:57.554
* and all the charm
surrounding it *

40:57.556 --> 40:59.055
I gotta go.

40:59.057 --> 41:01.024
* slowly disappears *

41:01.026 --> 41:03.493
yeah. Me, too.

41:06.231 --> 41:10.567
* could I be looking back
too much *

41:11.970 --> 41:13.937
hey.
Hi.

41:13.939 --> 41:16.873
I think I'm made you
too many omelettes.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.876
How do you feel about
huevos rancheros?

41:23.114 --> 41:26.182
Sam, we gotta talk.

41:28.086 --> 41:32.255
* and we face destination *

41:37.729 --> 41:41.264
* but look how far I've come *
