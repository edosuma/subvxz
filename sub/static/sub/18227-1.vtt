05:18.000 --> 05:20.912
Your wife will be wearing
a purple dress.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.034
Look for the hummingbird.

07:40.120 --> 07:41.553
Friends, colleagues...

07:41.720 --> 07:44.188
...and those who thought he was
a figment of my imagination...

07:45.040 --> 07:47.349
...may I introduce,
all the way from Paris...

07:47.440 --> 07:48.793
and completely out of the blue...

07:48.880 --> 07:51.235
my wonderful, wonderful husband!

07:53.400 --> 07:54.400
Bonsoir.

07:54.680 --> 07:56.511
I thought he was stuck in
France forever!

07:57.720 --> 07:58.948
So it is true.

07:59.080 --> 08:00.308
You do exist!

08:00.440 --> 08:02.032
Oui.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.077
Oh Maurice, how long do we have?

08:04.280 --> 08:06.157
The company gave me six weeks leave.

08:06.960 --> 08:09.235
Six weeks? That is a lifetime!

08:10.480 --> 08:13.199
You know, Christine never stops
talking about you.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.389
All good things I hope.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.994
All amazing.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.239
Oh hell, now I have to be amazing.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.754
Ladies and gentlemen...

08:22.840 --> 08:24.717
I haven't seen my wife in many months.

08:25.040 --> 08:27.759
I know you will forgive me
if I take her home...

08:29.600 --> 08:31.158
...we must renew our acquaintance.

08:32.360 --> 08:33.509
I must give you some money.

08:33.760 --> 08:36.797
No. Go, go.
We will settle the bill.

08:36.960 --> 08:39.349
You go settle your overdue account
with your husband.

08:42.760 --> 08:44.432
Maurice.
You have a wonderful wife.

08:44.760 --> 08:46.716
When you're settled,
we must all meet.

08:46.880 --> 08:48.560
You can tell us all about
phosphate mining.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.079
I look forward to it.

08:50.600 --> 08:51.600
À bientôt.

08:51.680 --> 08:53.716
- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir. Bonsoir.

09:07.920 --> 09:09.069
Merci.

09:18.320 --> 09:19.389
Not bad.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.551
You weren't so bad yourself.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.035
Max Vatan.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.072
Marian ne Beauséjour.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.309
I've heard a lot about you
around the circuit.

09:34.760 --> 09:36.671
I've heard a lot about you.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.912
Keep going straight.
I'll tell you when to turn.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.878
You were in Dieppe for a while?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.277
A husband would offer his wife
a cigarette

09:46.360 --> 09:48.157
before lighting his own.

09:48.680 --> 09:49.999
Turn right here.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.149
Thank you.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.592
What went wrong in Paris?
Your entire circuit was taken out.

10:03.440 --> 10:07.433
I never discuss non-relevant operational
information with anyone.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.272
I'll try to stay relevant then.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.953
That would be appreciated.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.348
Do they trust you?

10:14.120 --> 10:17.874
Two months ago, I got promoted
to the Embassy Liaison Department.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.350
I deal with the German legation
every day.

10:20.640 --> 10:22.119
But do they trust you?

10:23.200 --> 10:24.792
How did it look?

10:27.520 --> 10:28.873
They seemed to like you.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.952
And I like them.

10:31.560 --> 10:33.391
I keep the emotions real.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.312
That's why it works.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.079
Don't slow down.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.155
This is how you drive in Casablanca.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.674
Now that you're here I can show you off.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.915
We won't be in the apartment much.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.235
I have to go out there and sell you.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.913
We'll have to be careful.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.719
I've told everyone
my husband is from Paris.

11:30.600 --> 11:31.749
And?

11:32.600 --> 11:33.953
And...

11:34.440 --> 11:36.396
Your French is good,

11:36.800 --> 11:39.394
but your Parisian accent is terrible.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.111
I've been working
on it for months.

11:45.120 --> 11:46.189
Let's hear it.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.394
That was it.

11:48.720 --> 11:52.429
Oh. So then we're in trouble.

11:52.520 --> 11:54.476
That was pure Quebec.

11:55.920 --> 11:59.276
With French Moroccans
you might be okay,

11:59.600 --> 12:02.990
but we'll have to be careful
in front of real Parisians until the party.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.950
The party's in 10 days.
Is my invitation gonna be a problem?

12:08.320 --> 12:09.639
Now that you're here,

12:09.920 --> 12:12.798
I'm going to set up
a meeting with Herr Hobar.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.471
And then it's up to you.

12:17.320 --> 12:19.788
Can you stand 10 days
in this tiny little place,

12:20.080 --> 12:21.399
Le Québécois?

12:22.080 --> 12:23.559
It's not so bad.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.951
Water's hot, sometimes.

12:26.240 --> 12:27.753
I'll take the couch.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.311
Actually, you'll sleep on the roof.

12:30.680 --> 12:31.954
It's cooler.

12:32.840 --> 12:34.990
And in Casablanca,
the roof is where husbands go

12:35.080 --> 12:37.514
after they've made love to their wives.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.718
The neighbors will find it curious

13:08.800 --> 13:11.473
if I don't come to visit you
on your first night.

13:12.880 --> 13:16.998
I've told Madame Torgenot
and Madame Petit all about you.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.671
They'll be very excited.

13:20.200 --> 13:23.158
They'll guess that
the sex is already over.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.196
And it was great, by the way.

13:30.880 --> 13:31.880
Then,

13:32.360 --> 13:34.351
you went to the roof.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.832
I missed you

13:37.200 --> 13:40.237
because I've been sleeping alone
so many months.

13:40.560 --> 13:43.074
So I came up to tell you I love you.

13:45.080 --> 13:46.877
You're very thorough.

13:47.520 --> 13:49.750
That's why I'm still alive.

13:50.240 --> 13:51.912
Now we should talk.

13:52.400 --> 13:53.753
And laugh.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.952
Mmm. We're married.
Why would we laugh?

14:04.480 --> 14:05.799
Kiss me.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.273
Now talk.

14:17.760 --> 14:21.753
Tell me what you'll do after the war.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.109
I don't know what I'll do after the war.

14:30.480 --> 14:31.799
Look.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.268
The lovely Madame Petit
in apartment seven.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.954
She's married
to a German tank captain.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.678
And she's watching us.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.677
So we should talk. And laugh.

14:48.680 --> 14:49.829
Okay.

14:51.200 --> 14:53.794
After the war, I'm buying a ranch.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.479
With horses.

14:56.360 --> 14:57.793
A ranch!

14:58.480 --> 15:01.040
You mean, like in the movies?

15:01.360 --> 15:03.351
Cowboys? Bang, bang?

15:03.640 --> 15:04.640
Yeah.

15:06.840 --> 15:10.469
Are you just saying this to
say something, or is it real?

15:11.280 --> 15:12.474
Mmm, it's real.

15:12.560 --> 15:15.870
It's a ranch on a prairie

15:16.000 --> 15:18.070
outside a place called Medicine Hat.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.711
Now I know you're joking.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.831
You think you'll ever get there?

15:31.680 --> 15:32.680
Well,

15:33.200 --> 15:36.510
I guess that's not the point
of Medicine Hat, huh?

15:37.040 --> 15:38.040
No.

15:41.360 --> 15:44.033
Okay. That wasn't so hard, was it?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.512
Now this is the part
where I tell you I love you

15:49.840 --> 15:51.637
and leave you to count the stars,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.479
or whatever it is men do
on their rooftops.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.235
Je t'aime.

15:57.040 --> 15:58.359
Je t'aime aussi.

16:00.040 --> 16:01.712
Now kiss me again.

16:20.840 --> 16:21.909
Bon nuit.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.630
You can come in now.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.560
Voilà.

17:06.839 --> 17:09.512
You are somewhat formal and reserved.

17:10.359 --> 17:12.794
But you like expensive clothes.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.509
And your shoes are always polished.

17:18.359 --> 17:21.557
I told everyone
you're quite a serious Catholic.

17:30.120 --> 17:33.032
At least you can smell like a Parisian.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.311
I'll leave you to choose.

17:42.160 --> 17:43.195
Before I left London,

17:43.280 --> 17:45.475
Guy Sangster asked me
to say thank you.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.471
We flew Lizzies together.

17:52.920 --> 17:56.276
You remember Guy?
You got him out of Dieppe in '41.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.671
Okay. What did he say about me?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.672
He said you were beautiful.

18:04.360 --> 18:05.509
And good.

18:08.120 --> 18:11.396
Being good at this kind of work
is not very beautiful.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.393
You look okay.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.709
Let's go.

18:35.040 --> 18:37.474
Bonjour.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.872
It was a lovely mass...

18:47.040 --> 18:48.268
...good sermon as well.

18:48.920 --> 18:51.480
Did you get him an invitation
to the Ambassador's party yet?

18:51.840 --> 18:53.068
We're working on it.

18:53.160 --> 18:55.336
We're meeting some Government
people for dinner next week.

18:55.360 --> 18:56.679
You should come.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.598
Look at his face.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.597
That fake smile.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.274
Maurice isn't very sociable.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.197
We'll do it for the women, yes?

19:06.280 --> 19:07.280
Oui.

19:07.400 --> 19:10.676
Good. Until next week.

19:10.760 --> 19:12.352
- Au revoir.
- Au revoir.

19:16.840 --> 19:18.319
Merci.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.239
Bonjour.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.957
You seem to have all Vichy
under your spell, Madame Berne.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.916
Turn around and smile, Québécois.

19:33.320 --> 19:34.992
Bonjour.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.749
Ça va?

19:42.840 --> 19:44.592
The German officer at ten o'clock.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.920
The German officer at ten o'clock.
I think I recognize him.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.309
He was attached to the Abwehr.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.040
He was attached to the Abwehr.
In Marseille.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.718
He interrogated me once.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.640
He hasn't seen you.
He's reading his paper.

20:05.480 --> 20:06.708
Merci.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.674
You're sure that it's him?

20:18.880 --> 20:20.108
Oui.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.920
Really sure?

20:22.120 --> 20:23.758
60% sure.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.515
Put me through to the Vichy
Commissariat of Police.

20:53.640 --> 20:54.640
Quickly.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.274
Yes... I'll hold.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.871
Sounds like somebody's choking
back there.

21:49.640 --> 21:50.959
Okay, chérie.

21:55.960 --> 21:57.154
Mademoiselle.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.957
Maurice, meet my friend Vincent...

22:24.040 --> 22:26.110
...he's also from Paris.

22:27.920 --> 22:28.920
My love!

22:29.280 --> 22:30.280
I'm bored.

22:30.840 --> 22:31.909
Dance with me.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.198
You're utterly crazy, Madame Berne.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.070
Yes.

22:35.200 --> 22:37.714
You could do with being
a little crazy yourself.

22:45.560 --> 22:46.560
Well played.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.628
Watch out for him.

22:54.400 --> 22:56.789
A lot of jealous guys giving me
the evil eye.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.390
It's because they know
I'm in love with you.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.353
It's very obvious.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.748
Mmm.

23:28.320 --> 23:29.992
What went wrong in Paris?

23:32.280 --> 23:35.158
V Section left us hanging out to dry.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.072
How'd you get away?

23:39.240 --> 23:40.593
I ran.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.353
And ran, and kept on running.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.193
Madam Petit.
Lurking in the window.

24:15.320 --> 24:16.878
Bonsoir.

24:38.720 --> 24:40.312
This Herr Hobar
we're meeting tomorrow,

24:40.400 --> 24:41.674
what can you tell me about him?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.396
He's the Ambassador's liaison.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.915
A high-ranking Party member
from Cologne.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.390
He likes golf and gambling.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.551
He's our final hurdle.

24:53.320 --> 24:54.912
You have two seconds.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.840
Go.

25:25.400 --> 25:28.312
The guns will be taped
under the champagne table.

25:28.960 --> 25:32.111
The Ambassador arrives
at precisely 8:30.

25:32.680 --> 25:34.193
If he's late?

25:34.600 --> 25:37.319
He's German. He'll be on time.

25:38.280 --> 25:40.236
How come you don't know Stens?

25:40.840 --> 25:42.478
I do know Stens.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.878
I didn't see you set the travel safety.

25:47.480 --> 25:49.948
You'll be okay to use
a Sten on the night, though?

25:51.320 --> 25:53.788
I would be okay if I had to use cutlery.

25:58.840 --> 26:02.879
The diversion attack will happen
five minutes later at 8:35.

26:04.640 --> 26:07.393
And then everything will be
in God's hands.

26:07.560 --> 26:08.560
Good.

26:09.400 --> 26:11.709
Hopefully, he'll know
how to work the safety.

26:23.560 --> 26:24.879
It's hot.

27:00.760 --> 27:02.193
What are you doing?

27:03.600 --> 27:04.919
Testing you

27:05.880 --> 27:07.598
the way you tested me.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.669
I know you are armed
with a weapon, Mr. Vatan.

27:11.840 --> 27:15.071
I'm just checking
your safety catch is engaged.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.274
There.

27:21.600 --> 27:23.591
We had our first fight.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.111
Now we're okay again, yes?

27:28.360 --> 27:29.679
Marianne,

27:30.880 --> 27:32.640
we both know people
who've fucked each other.

27:32.720 --> 27:35.075
Then they fucked up,
and now they're fucking dead.

27:35.520 --> 27:37.636
Wow, that's a lot of fucks.

27:39.920 --> 27:41.558
Fasten your goddamn buttons.

27:52.760 --> 27:54.512
Actually, Max,

27:55.680 --> 28:00.435
the mistake people make
in these situations isn't fucking.

28:01.080 --> 28:02.752
It's feeling.

29:29.600 --> 29:30.680
Have you been waiting long?

29:30.720 --> 29:32.119
Non.

29:43.040 --> 29:44.996
Herr Hobarwill see you now.

29:59.400 --> 30:00.674
Oh, merci.

30:01.920 --> 30:02.955
Non.

30:03.080 --> 30:04.957
My husband's trying to cut down.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.191
He says the war makes everyone
smoke too much.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.748
I've only heard good things
about him around town.

30:10.840 --> 30:11.909
Good things.

30:13.320 --> 30:14.719
Sit down, please.

30:19.680 --> 30:21.477
Your husband doesn't speak English?

30:21.560 --> 30:23.232
Only a little.

30:25.240 --> 30:28.835
Your wife has asked if she could bring
you to the Ambassador's Ball tomorrow.

30:28.920 --> 30:30.751
Yes, but...

30:31.080 --> 30:32.911
...if it's a problem, I understand.

30:34.240 --> 30:36.231
He doesn't seem to want to come.

30:38.440 --> 30:39.475
Oh.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.831
There is a stupid poker game
in the Rue Valence.

30:42.920 --> 30:44.990
I see.

30:46.600 --> 30:48.431
What are you saying about me?

30:48.600 --> 30:51.319
Don't embarrass me.
You're coming and that's that.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.152
So, your husband plays poker?

30:53.280 --> 30:54.599
Oh, he's obsessed.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.591
As am I. As am I.

30:56.840 --> 30:59.274
And now we cut. High card wins.

31:00.520 --> 31:01.873
Wins what?

31:01.960 --> 31:03.240
If his card is higher than mine,

31:03.320 --> 31:04.719
he can go to his poker game.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.035
If it's lower, he must come to the party.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.960
This is too absurd.

31:13.200 --> 31:14.758
Shuffle, Mr. Berne.

31:17.040 --> 31:18.917
High card wins.

31:35.480 --> 31:36.480
Mining?

31:37.440 --> 31:38.509
Yes.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.109
He works with phosphate, right?

31:46.200 --> 31:47.474
That's right.

31:59.080 --> 32:02.311
Now cut, Mr. Berne.
For your freedom.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.360
Too bad.

32:31.520 --> 32:33.476
No pokerforyou.

32:39.480 --> 32:40.708
Merci.

32:42.520 --> 32:43.873
- Merci.
- Au revoir.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.193
Ah. Uh...

32:46.360 --> 32:48.828
One more thing. Boring. Procedure.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.639
For new names on the list.

32:52.760 --> 32:54.034
Mr. Berne...

32:54.120 --> 32:58.079
...write down the chemical formula
for phosphate, please.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.632
See you both tomorrow.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.711
So, it's in the cards.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.709
We get our chance to make history.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.153
I couldn't sleep.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.240
Mmm.

34:05.880 --> 34:08.713
I won't let you down, Le Québécois.

34:10.719 --> 34:11.789
I know.

34:16.960 --> 34:20.315
Let's get out of here.
Let's go watch the sunrise.

34:29.239 --> 34:30.797
What are our odds?

34:31.159 --> 34:32.478
Of surviving?

34:32.840 --> 34:34.193
60-40.

34:34.800 --> 34:36.119
Against.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.272
Both of us, I don't know.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.435
So, tell me about Medicine Hat.

34:49.800 --> 34:53.509
Pretty green. Rolling hills. Clear water.

34:55.120 --> 34:57.509
Just a place I go when things get dark.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.469
You?

35:01.320 --> 35:02.833
You have a place?

35:04.200 --> 35:06.191
When the war is over,

35:07.000 --> 35:08.991
it won't matter where I am.

35:19.960 --> 35:21.439
We should be going.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.351
If we're dead tomorrow,

35:57.440 --> 35:59.112
no one would know.

37:59.880 --> 38:01.472
You look beautiful.

38:02.680 --> 38:04.033
The guns?

38:04.240 --> 38:05.559
Gone.

38:06.480 --> 38:07.480
Bien.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.158
Merci, Le Québécois.

38:11.240 --> 38:13.071
I'm from Ontario.

38:19.400 --> 38:20.719
Merci.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.797
It's 8:32.

38:25.040 --> 38:27.110
Three minutes until
the diversion.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.996
In this kind of situation, I find it
useful to think about something funny.

38:44.960 --> 38:46.188
Smile or something.

38:48.400 --> 38:49.958
You look beautiful.

38:51.720 --> 38:52.994
You already told me that.

38:53.600 --> 38:54.600
Quoi?

38:56.880 --> 38:58.074
Can you even see me?

39:00.600 --> 39:01.600
Not really.

39:24.360 --> 39:26.032
Ah. You two.

39:26.040 --> 39:26.677
- Ah. You two.
- Good evening.

39:26.840 --> 39:28.068
Good evening. How are you?

39:28.640 --> 39:30.073
Very well, thank you. And you?

39:30.160 --> 39:31.160
Not bad.

39:33.000 --> 39:34.115
So...?

39:35.440 --> 39:38.159
So... It's lovely.

39:38.280 --> 39:39.280
Mmm.

39:41.640 --> 39:42.959
Heil Hitler.

39:50.480 --> 39:51.799
He's late.

41:38.480 --> 41:39.595
Move!

42:31.720 --> 42:33.438
No one's following us.

42:38.800 --> 42:42.236
We're alive, Max. We're both alive.

42:45.320 --> 42:46.639
Come with me to London.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.396
Come with me to London
and be my wife.

43:34.840 --> 43:35.909
George?

43:36.480 --> 43:37.993
Salute me, Frenchman.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.833
- Go to hell.
- This is hell, it's an office.

43:41.160 --> 43:44.232
I heard an unspeakable rumor
about you being in love.

43:44.360 --> 43:45.360
Oh.

43:45.480 --> 43:47.516
Gotta go, George. Buy me a drink later.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.319
Max, you appear to be walking on air.
It's revolting!

43:50.520 --> 43:52.238
- Good morning, sir.
- Morning.

43:52.520 --> 43:53.840
They said Frank wanted to see me?

43:53.920 --> 43:55.512
Yes, straight away.

43:57.160 --> 44:00.277
Max, please remember
you're in the land of "Yes, sir, no, sir."

44:00.440 --> 44:01.998
Don't throw anything or hit anyone.

44:02.080 --> 44:03.080
Got it.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.672
He's ready to see you.

44:13.120 --> 44:14.189
Frank.

44:20.440 --> 44:22.271
They said you had news.

44:23.040 --> 44:25.349
Yes, yes, I have news,
Wing Commander,

44:25.440 --> 44:28.034
regarding Marianne Beauséjour.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.555
It's been three fucking weeks.

44:33.280 --> 44:34.554
"Sir."

44:34.920 --> 44:36.911
"It's been three fucking weeks, sir."

44:37.200 --> 44:39.316
It's been three fucking weeks, sir.

44:40.560 --> 44:46.430
After a thorough vetting procedure
carried out by V Section in Gibraltar,

44:47.920 --> 44:50.309
Marianne Beauséjour

44:51.120 --> 44:54.032
has been approved
for passage to England.

45:00.040 --> 45:01.792
That'll be all, Wing Commander.

45:03.600 --> 45:04.953
Max.

45:05.960 --> 45:07.712
You're a bloody fool.

45:08.120 --> 45:09.633
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

45:09.960 --> 45:13.032
Marriages made in the field never work.

45:13.840 --> 45:15.512
You're absolutely right, sir.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.955
You're invited to the wedding,
by the way.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.313
Bravo!

45:25.960 --> 45:27.480
Careful, careful, Max!
Hold on.

45:27.560 --> 45:28.959
Here we go. Come on.

45:29.200 --> 45:30.519
That's it.

45:30.640 --> 45:32.232
Come on in, darlings.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.800
Don't ask me why that's true.

45:39.840 --> 45:41.637
What the hell have we here?

45:41.840 --> 45:45.674
Here's a fun fact.
Only thing in London not rationed,

45:45.920 --> 45:47.035
champagne!

45:47.160 --> 45:48.673
Champagne and sex.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.877
Oh, my God, Max,
your sister is obsessed!

45:52.040 --> 45:53.837
Yes. Isn't it wonderful?

45:54.000 --> 45:57.549
To my formerly permafrosted brother,

45:57.880 --> 46:00.678
thawed at last by love.

46:00.880 --> 46:02.836
That's rather poetic.

46:04.120 --> 46:06.395
Oh, for goodness sake!

46:10.600 --> 46:13.034
Honestly, I'll miss the Blitz.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.712
I will. No one cares
who does what to who.

46:17.040 --> 46:19.918
So we should be drinking to war.
And freedom.

46:20.040 --> 46:22.713
- To war!
- To freedom.

46:22.880 --> 46:25.519
Marianne, I would offer you
my congratulations,

46:25.600 --> 46:27.830
but I've known Max a long time.

46:27.960 --> 46:30.110
I'll just wish you good luck.

46:31.720 --> 46:32.914
Mmm, no, no, no.

46:33.000 --> 46:37.516
Now my brother is just
an ordinary man flying a desk

46:37.600 --> 46:39.318
in some boring office.

46:39.440 --> 46:41.158
Oh, oh,
a talented boy like Max

46:41.240 --> 46:43.470
won't be behind a desk
with Frank for long.

46:43.840 --> 46:45.671
Our spooky friends from V Section,

46:45.760 --> 46:49.355
they will come calling
just when you least expect it.

46:58.040 --> 47:01.032
You entirely okay, Madame Vatan?

47:02.600 --> 47:03.874
Entirely.

47:11.080 --> 47:13.036
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

47:13.280 --> 47:15.191
Get up! Get outside!

47:18.640 --> 47:21.279
Hang on! Get her out. Quickly.

47:21.400 --> 47:22.594
Quickly.

47:33.040 --> 47:35.076
I need that trolley. Help me.

47:35.320 --> 47:37.072
Get this up now. Come on.

47:37.320 --> 47:38.878
Get her on it. Away from the wall.

47:39.000 --> 47:40.433
Come on. Come on.

47:40.840 --> 47:43.229
Help me, someone! Come and help me!

47:43.560 --> 47:46.393
That's it. I need some help!

47:46.880 --> 47:49.553
Get me some light over here now!

47:56.120 --> 47:57.189
Very close.

47:57.600 --> 47:59.238
Good girl. Good girl.

48:02.400 --> 48:04.516
Pant for me. Good girl.

48:16.480 --> 48:17.833
C'est moi.

48:17.920 --> 48:20.753
This is really me, as I am before God.

48:38.320 --> 48:39.753
It's a girl.

49:03.840 --> 49:05.512
Anna...

49:05.520 --> 49:07.750
Anna... it's you.

50:35.320 --> 50:36.719
Mmm.

50:50.440 --> 50:52.635
There. A celebration.

50:52.760 --> 50:53.760
For what?

50:53.800 --> 50:56.439
Your first weekend off in 57 days.

50:56.960 --> 50:58.473
I counted.

51:00.440 --> 51:03.750
- Are the eggs from the hens?
- From our hens.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.596
Ah, so they were
a good investment, hmm?

51:07.240 --> 51:08.559
Weren't they?

51:08.960 --> 51:10.109
Max,

51:10.800 --> 51:13.234
let's go to the heath
and pick mushrooms.

51:14.600 --> 51:17.319
Tomorrow I want to serve stroganoff
at the party.

51:18.960 --> 51:20.279
What party?

51:21.080 --> 51:24.868
Oh, darling, I've got lots of new friends
who are dying to meet you.

51:24.960 --> 51:26.313
You'll like them.

51:26.720 --> 51:30.190
They're refugees.
Intellectuals. Bohemians.

51:30.680 --> 51:33.240
Hampstead is full of interesting people.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.509
Hello.

51:35.680 --> 51:36.795
Hello.

51:38.320 --> 51:39.833
Poor Max.

51:40.200 --> 51:42.668
In Casablanca,
we pretended you hated parties,

51:42.760 --> 51:44.830
and voilà, it's true!

51:50.200 --> 51:51.720
What's the new
nanny's name again?

51:51.800 --> 51:53.480
- Miss Sinclair.
- Miss Sinclair.

51:54.040 --> 51:56.031
- Hello, Miss Sinclair.
- Hello.

51:56.680 --> 51:59.148
Max has three days off. Isn't that great?

51:59.320 --> 52:00.833
She just woke up.

52:01.040 --> 52:02.109
We won't be long.

52:02.200 --> 52:03.640
We're just gonna
pick some mushrooms.

52:03.720 --> 52:05.199
Oh, take your time.

52:05.840 --> 52:07.831
It's always my pleasure.

52:09.040 --> 52:10.473
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

52:24.000 --> 52:26.992
I have to go and get Anna.

52:30.560 --> 52:34.348
Just once you can ignore it. Just once.

52:39.760 --> 52:41.398
Hampstead 235.

52:47.760 --> 52:50.354
Sure. 1500. I'll be there.

52:52.880 --> 52:54.757
When will you be back?

52:55.400 --> 52:57.197
You know I don't know.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.398
What the hell is it that's so important?

53:01.560 --> 53:03.278
Liberating your country.

53:06.600 --> 53:08.238
Then you must go.

53:17.960 --> 53:19.109
Good morning, Margaret.

53:19.560 --> 53:20.920
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Afternoon.

53:21.080 --> 53:22.593
George is in your office.

53:24.120 --> 53:25.917
I thought you said
to meet you in the mess.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.638
Uh, I lied.

53:27.760 --> 53:29.716
It isn't me
you're here to see.

53:29.800 --> 53:31.597
- Oh, do you...
- No.

53:31.920 --> 53:35.230
No, V Section want to speak to you.

53:35.920 --> 53:37.512
Well, why didn't they call me?

53:37.600 --> 53:39.033
Because V Section, they never say

53:39.120 --> 53:41.111
what they mean
and they never mean what they say.

53:41.200 --> 53:43.634
And they never say anything
on the phone.

53:44.120 --> 53:47.476
I told you they'd come for you eventually,
didn't I, Max?

53:48.160 --> 53:49.878
Such a clever boy.

53:50.640 --> 53:54.155
Well, I suppose I ought to
congratulate you on your promotion.

53:54.480 --> 53:56.914
Since you seem to know so much,
what is the position?

53:57.000 --> 53:59.594
Oh, it goes way, way above my level
of security, old man.

53:59.680 --> 54:01.989
I'm just the messenger boy.

54:55.800 --> 54:58.030
- Wing Commander.
- Frank.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.553
Have a seat.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.551
We haven't been introduced.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.913
Okay, Frank, whatever the job is,
I don't want it.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.150
I'm perfectly happy to stay with you.

55:22.760 --> 55:23.760
Max,

55:24.320 --> 55:27.835
I'm afraid this really
isn't what you think it is.

55:28.480 --> 55:30.914
And, well,

55:31.320 --> 55:34.471
there's no easy way to say
what we're about to say.

55:35.480 --> 55:38.836
We believe your wife is a German spy.

55:46.360 --> 55:48.828
Okay, wait. Wait.

55:50.840 --> 55:52.831
Seriously, Frank, who is this?

55:52.920 --> 55:54.831
I'm a rat catcher.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.675
I also outrank you,
so you can call me "sir."

55:59.760 --> 56:01.591
You have to listen to him, Max.

56:01.680 --> 56:03.193
He outranks both of us.

56:03.520 --> 56:04.669
Over the past seven days,

56:04.760 --> 56:08.275
V Section has intercepted
coded messages

56:08.360 --> 56:12.035
being sent from London to Berlin
on a WT transceiver.

56:12.120 --> 56:14.350
We haven't traced the signal
to an address yet,

56:14.440 --> 56:18.035
but it's coming from the Highgate region
of North London,

56:18.120 --> 56:19.519
and the information

56:19.800 --> 56:23.952
concerns the activities
of SOE circuits in France.

56:24.640 --> 56:27.712
In one transcript,
the agent refers to his source as,

56:27.880 --> 56:30.872
"Fräulein." So it's a woman.

56:32.880 --> 56:36.429
Okay, okay, Frank, can we speak alone
for a moment?

56:36.520 --> 56:37.794
Wing Commander Vatan,

56:37.880 --> 56:41.156
do you ever speak to your wife
about your work?

56:42.640 --> 56:43.709
Okay.

56:44.040 --> 56:46.998
Uh, sir, before this
thing gets out of hand,

56:47.640 --> 56:49.756
may I speak? Hmm?

56:49.840 --> 56:51.239
May I speak?

56:51.760 --> 56:53.398
- Yes.
- Yes?

56:54.680 --> 56:56.989
My wife is Marianne Beauséjour.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.673
Marianne Beauséjour ran the most
effective resistance circuit in Paris

57:02.080 --> 57:05.914
until V Section fucked it up
for her in '41.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.999
We met in Casablanca,

57:09.520 --> 57:13.991
where together we assassinated
the German Ambassador.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.911
She's the mother of my child.

57:19.360 --> 57:21.351
She gave birth to my child,
for Chrissake.

57:22.080 --> 57:24.674
This is a translated transcript
of an interrogation

57:24.760 --> 57:27.433
of a German Abwehr officer
captured in Tobruk.

57:27.520 --> 57:31.559
Amongst many other things,
he claims that Marianne Beauséjour

57:31.680 --> 57:34.877
was arrested and executed in May 1941

57:34.960 --> 57:37.315
when the rest of her circuit
was captured in Paris.

57:37.400 --> 57:39.675
Marianne Beauséjour's identity

57:39.760 --> 57:43.355
was then given to a German agent
of similar build and coloring.

57:43.480 --> 57:48.110
She was flown to Casablanca,
where no one knew the real Marianne.

57:48.560 --> 57:50.835
And it was subsequently discovered

57:50.920 --> 57:53.388
that the German Ambassador

57:53.720 --> 57:57.190
who you assassinated in Casablanca
was a dissident.

57:57.280 --> 57:59.919
Hitler wanted him killed.

58:01.320 --> 58:02.878
This is insane.

58:04.000 --> 58:07.788
All the information
in the intercepted communications

58:08.160 --> 58:10.993
had crossed your desk.

58:11.640 --> 58:13.915
Yes, everything crosses
my fucking desk.

58:14.000 --> 58:17.675
Max, this is now an operational mission.

58:18.240 --> 58:20.993
If Marianne is indeed a German spy...

58:21.080 --> 58:24.311
- My wife is not a spy!
- If she is,

58:24.680 --> 58:27.672
we need to keep her in place
for 72 hours

58:27.960 --> 58:31.953
so that we can identify her handler
and clean out the rest of her circuit.

58:37.440 --> 58:38.440
No.

58:56.240 --> 58:59.118
Now we've got that out of the way,
perhaps we could discuss

58:59.240 --> 59:03.119
the operational details
of the next 72 hours?

59:05.600 --> 59:09.559
So, this is gonna be a standard
"blue-dye" procedure, blue dye being...

59:09.640 --> 59:11.278
I know what a "blue-dye" is.

59:11.800 --> 59:12.800
Tonight,

59:12.880 --> 59:16.236
you will receive a telephone call
at exactly 2307.

59:16.320 --> 59:17.958
Repeat the time, Wing Commander.

59:19.800 --> 59:20.994
2307, sir.

59:21.080 --> 59:23.056
You will take the call
and you will write down a message

59:23.080 --> 59:24.559
somewhere your wife can read it.

59:24.640 --> 59:26.710
It'll be false information,
only you will have it.

59:26.800 --> 59:30.634
But it'll appear to be of a high grade,
so she will have to pass it on quickly.

59:31.000 --> 59:32.558
By midday on Monday,

59:32.640 --> 59:36.838
our agents will have decoded
enemy traffic from the weekend.

59:37.160 --> 59:41.870
So if the false information
is among the batches sent from London,

59:42.000 --> 59:44.116
we shall know for sure.

59:44.480 --> 59:45.674
If you are right, Max,

59:45.760 --> 59:48.832
the information won't appear
on the transcripts,

59:49.160 --> 59:50.991
and all this will be forgotten.

59:53.640 --> 59:57.474
But if it is proven that
your wife is a spy,

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:06.957
routine procedures in cases
of intimate betrayal

01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.151
will apply.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:12.115
You will execute her
with your own hand,

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:15.590
and if we discover
that you are an accomplice in any way,

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.716
you will be hanged for high treason.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.474
Wing Commander Vatan,
do you understand?

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:28.830
He needs to confirm
that he understands

01:00:29.160 --> 01:00:30.832
routine procedures in...

01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:33.388
He understands the procedure, damn it.

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.359
Good.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.992
Max, it is vital
you do nothing differently.

01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:43.318
You are not to investigate
or take matters into your own hands,

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.719
do you understand?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.719
Sir, I, uh...

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.911
I apologize for behaving
unprofessionally just then.

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.390
But I know for a fact
you'll be proven wrong.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.398
Now, Wing Commander,
you will go home

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.715
and carry on as if nothing's happened.

01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:13.593
You're dismissed.

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:06.469
You were ages.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.474
You know how it is.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.431
Once you get in, you can't get out.

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.875
A young pilot needed a pep talk.

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.470
Then I got dragged into a briefing.

01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:25.708
Hey.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:29.030
What happened to my kiss?

01:02:34.160 --> 01:02:35.718
How's the princess?

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.319
Sleeping.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.192
Well, the big news is
I definitely have the weekend off.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.195
Until the phone rings.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.469
Nope.

01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.711
Definitely free the whole weekend.

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.713
So...

01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.068
The party is on.

01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.871
Yeah, the party's on.

01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:47.236
We'll need to get some drinks
for tomorrow night.

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.360
Mmm-hmm.

01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:50.471
I'll pick some up in the morning.

01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:02.638
It's like they're watching us.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.831
Honey... Honey, give me my arm.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:11.269
Honey, give me my arm.
Give me my arm.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:14.871
Hampstead 235.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:17.670
Wing Commander Vatan.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.876
- Honey, do you have a pen?
- No.

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:23.312
Mmm-hmm. Go ahead.

01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:33.511
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:34.480 --> 01:05:35.480
Yeah.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.679
Mmm-hmm.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.873
Yeah, I got it.
I'll dispatch it in the morning.

01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:11.035
Don't think I'm going
to let you sleep, Mr. Vatan.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.756
I keep the emotions real.

01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:59.472
That's why it works.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:43.231
Come back to bed.

01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.032
It'll be okay.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.554
It'll be okay, because it's not true.

01:08:38.479 --> 01:08:39.629
Honey,

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.752
you're in uniform.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:44.434
Yeah, I'm gonna pop by the base
and pick up some whiskey.

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:47.176
There's 50 cases of the good stuff
stashed in the diplomatic hangar.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.234
They won't miss a few.

01:08:48.319 --> 01:08:50.390
Why not just go to the shop?

01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:52.955
Nothing but the best
for your intellectuals.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.593
I'll meet you at the pub after
and we'll pick up the beer.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:01.353
Of course.

01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.711
- Hi.
- Max.

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.710
What the hell brings you here?

01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.231
I just dropped by to invite you both
to a party tonight.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:09:59.959
Why didn't you just phone?

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:04.550
Max, you look like you did

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.876
the day that you burned the barn down.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.239
Marianne's cooking.
Why don't you come by?

01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:19.994
Actually, Max,
tonight might not be possible.

01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.155
Max!

01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:23.834
Max, I heard that you were in V Section.

01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:26.354
If they're offering you
some kind of suicide mission,

01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:28.078
you can say no to them, you know that.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.519
You hardly have anything on.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.591
What's happened? Max.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:36.356
They're running a blue-dye on Marianne.

01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:39.794
Oh, my God.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.519
But it isn't true.

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.438
And I will prove it.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:48.191
I'd like you there tonight.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.191
Excuse me. Where can I find
Group Captain Guy Sangster?

01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:20.192
He's in the chapel, sir.

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:37.119
Hello, Guy.

01:11:40.120 --> 01:11:42.634
Wing Commander Vatan.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.236
What do you want from me, Max?

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:51.475
I'm finished.
You people just threw me away.

01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.552
I need your help.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.548
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.319
Tough.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:13.871
I'm trusting you to tell no one about this.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.109
Fuck you!

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.753
I've been left here to fucking rot, Max!

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.150
You told me you were smuggled
out of France by Marianne Beauséjour.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:27.192
Dieppe, 1941.

01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:29.433
Is this her?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.675
Why are you asking me about your wife?

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:36.910
Guy, please, is this her?

01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:40.191
Oh, they didn't tell you.

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.034
Max.

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.510
My right eye has been shot out

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:49.956
and my left retina is detached.

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.109
All I can see is

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.793
a white shape.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.629
Fuck.

01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:04.031
Well, you know, Max,
if you hadn't sent me into a strip

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:07.112
covered in fucking German AAA!

01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.316
My own son screamed when he saw me.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.958
I'm sorry, Guy.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:24.760
Max?

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:27.913
Delamare.

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:33.469
Delamare is still operational in Dieppe.

01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:42.317
Hampstead 235.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.671
Hi, honey, I'm at the strip.

01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:47.696
They're asking people
to give blood after the raid,

01:13:47.720 --> 01:13:49.073
so I'm gonna be another hour.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.912
So meet you at the pub after?

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:53.429
Yes, I'll ask Mrs. Sinclair
to look after Anna.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.936
Okay, I love you. I'll see you there.

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.279
Love you.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.628
Corporal.

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.234
Put two cases of scotch
from the officers' crate in my car.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:44.056
- Keep a bottle for yourself.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:46.310
- Who's flying Dieppe tonight?
- Hunter, sir.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:49.114
- Where can I find him?
- Try the shithouse, sir.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.319
At ease.

01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:08.669
Sorry, sir.

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.513
Something I've eaten.

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:12.352
These'll settle your stomach.

01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.594
I'm going to save
the amphetamines until takeoff.

01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.911
Then barbiturates when I get back.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.433
If I get back.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.232
There's an operative in Dieppe.

01:15:25.320 --> 01:15:27.390
His name is Paul Delamare.
Do you know him?

01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:30.353
No. This is my first time.

01:15:30.680 --> 01:15:32.079
First time to Dieppe?

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:35.432
First time behind enemy lines ever, sir.

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.871
Paul Delamare runs the landing sites.

01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:42.951
You can't miss him,
he only has one arm.

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.430
He's usually had a few, but he's okay.

01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:47.073
I want you to give him this.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:49.594
Give it only to him,
only to the man with one arm.

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.199
Is this Marianne Beauséjour?

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:54.477
Tell him you need an answer.
A simple oui or non. Only that.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560
Yes, sir.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:58.756
Wait for my call in the telegraph office.

01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:00.114
I'll call you at midnight.

01:16:02.640 --> 01:16:04.312
This is classified.

01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:06.552
No one must know, you understand?

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:07.640
Yes, sir.

01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:09.153
It's very important.

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.231
You can count on me, sir.

01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:16.069
The fields in Dieppe
are lined with poplar trees.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.640
They're invisible if there's no moon,

01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:20.353
- so climb quickly.
- I know. I've been briefed.

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:22.840
Good.

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.232
Who are you thinking about?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.319
My mother.

01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:31.720
Don't.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.672
Think about your father.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.998
He's proud of you.

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:42.999
Yes, sir.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.712
- Oh.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800
Thank you.

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.549
Hi, Billy. Two brandies.

01:17:37.120 --> 01:17:38.235
Sorry.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.791
I've ordered three crates of bitter.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.554
Hazel, filthy pipe smoke.

01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.713
Thank you.

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:52.472
Did you get the whiskey?

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.796
I did. Churchill's own.

01:17:57.240 --> 01:18:01.279
A husband would offer his wife
a cigarette before lighting his own.

01:18:10.760 --> 01:18:12.751
You did give blood!

01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:15.479
Good.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.833
I thought perhaps
you were out with your mistress.

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:23.597
It would explain why
you were different with me last night.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:25.835
Different?

01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:28.279
In bed.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.116
It felt different.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.473
Good.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.549
Excuse me!

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:59.633
Me and my mates would really love
to see you two ladies kiss each other.

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.472
I don't believe it!

01:19:07.400 --> 01:19:08.913
That was crazy!

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.908
Max, this is splendid.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.679
Marianne!

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.594
Wonderful party! Brilliant!

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.512
Getting enough to drink?

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.353
Very funny, old man.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:39.391
Hey, excuse me.
We have a garden for that.

01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:41.351
Take it outside, please.

01:19:45.520 --> 01:19:48.353
Okay. You two, outside. Outside.

01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.715
Come here.

01:19:52.760 --> 01:19:55.194
My people
are behaving so badly.

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.960
I thought they would eat something,

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.235
not just drink and have sex.

01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:03.915
Half of them I don't even know.
I think word spread around Hampstead.

01:20:04.480 --> 01:20:06.710
C'est Londres.
C'est la guerre.

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:14.434
Would you go check no one is
actually fucking in Anna's room?

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:15.875
Sure.

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.151
Max! Max, Max.

01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:32.920
Ooh. Ooh.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.149
Sorry.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.593
Listen.

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:42.071
I've been briefed that you're operational,

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:45.159
but I haven't been told
why you're operational.

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:47.795
Now, look, I thought as a friend

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:51.356
I ought to just give you
a word of warning.

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:56.513
If the job V Section are offering you
is the one everyone's talking about...

01:20:57.000 --> 01:21:01.039
Max, if they want you to run
the resistance in France on D-Day,

01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.353
you should know they wouldn't
just call you in for a job interview.

01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:06.476
They would test you somehow.

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.429
Test?

01:21:08.800 --> 01:21:09.869
How?

01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:12.349
Way, way above
my security clearance, old man.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:16.831
But if I were you,
I'd tell them to stick their job.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.634
Careful, Margaret.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.320
Max.

01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:43.551
I was able to make it after all.

01:21:43.880 --> 01:21:46.872
Frank! I didn't expect you.

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:50.313
Please introduce a little sobriety
to the affair.

01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:52.630
I wasn't planning on doing
anything of the sort.

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.557
A large whiskey and soda, if you please.

01:21:54.680 --> 01:21:57.672
Would you get it, honey?
Frank still has his work face on.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:22:00.310
You keep chickens, don't you?

01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.231
Frank, you know too much.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:05.436
Show me your chickens, Max.

01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:24.957
You willfully and blatantly
disobeyed orders.

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.912
First you visit Guy Sangster

01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.496
and burst
half his bloody stitches, then...

01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:31.114
Frank, if it was your wife,
would you trust V Section?

01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.158
Adam Hunter's Lysander
was shot to pieces three hours ago.

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:37.191
On the ground. With him in it!

01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:39.033
He's dead!

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:41.995
Because he stayed too long
waiting for an answer

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:44.230
to a question from a drunk.

01:22:44.600 --> 01:22:46.750
Frank, tell me.

01:22:47.560 --> 01:22:49.869
- Is this a game?
- A game?

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.235
A game.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:52.719
A test.

01:22:55.560 --> 01:22:57.232
I was just saying to Max

01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.551
that he's taken to office life
like a duck to water.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.073
I wouldn't know.

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:05.719
I hardly see him.

01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:08.431
Come on, honey, let's dance.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.751
Frank brought you bad news?

01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:23.238
Another boy dead.

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:30.115
Something more than that, I think.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.710
I asked Bridget
if there was something wrong with you,

01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:35.791
and she said you were fine.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:40.074
But she's not trained to lie
like you and me.

01:23:45.640 --> 01:23:48.438
We've had a setback.
I can't talk about it.

01:23:54.600 --> 01:23:56.875
I think something's
burning in the oven!

01:23:56.960 --> 01:23:59.030
It could be the stroganoff.

01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:16.112
Stand down, Flight Lieutenant.

01:24:16.520 --> 01:24:18.158
- Margaret?
- Sir.

01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:20.718
Is the Dieppe drop still on tomorrow?

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:22.392
I believe it is, sir.

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:25.153
- Forecast?
- Clear skies, sir.

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.309
Hey.

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.149
The man with the pipe. Who is he?

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.033
His name is Lombard.

01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.355
He has a jewelry shop
on the high street.

01:25:02.440 --> 01:25:05.113
He was trying to sell me
a diamond broach.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:07.510
But I told him we're broke.

01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.751
Hey, where are you going?

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.509
- Max!
- Marianne.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.656
I really need to speak to you.

01:25:14.680 --> 01:25:15.880
Oh. Jeffrey, you're too drunk.

01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.280
Hey.

01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:30.711
Your wife changed her mind.

01:25:31.480 --> 01:25:33.232
You mean about the earrings.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:37.113
No, no, no,
I was trying to sell her a broach.

01:25:37.560 --> 01:25:40.870
I do have some beautiful earrings.
I can offer you a very good price.

01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.235
Max.

01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:47.155
It's okay, Mr. Lombard.
We really are broke.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:50.559
Good night.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.994
Good night.

01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.991
I'll have to get Anna.

01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:24.714
I didn't hear a siren.
Where were the sirens?

01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:28.713
Now they sound the alarm.

01:26:28.800 --> 01:26:31.109
Bloody ARP, always two steps behind.

01:26:31.440 --> 01:26:33.829
Get these bloody lights off!

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:43.951
They're targeting the East End again.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.711
We should be all right here.

01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:51.790
Max, no more.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:53.959
Please?

01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:57.191
By Monday morning, we'll...

01:26:57.280 --> 01:26:59.191
We'll know for sure.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.837
Try and get some rest.

01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:07.315
- Frank?
- It's not a game.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.513
Even if it is,

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:15.271
V Section wouldn't tell you.

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:16.839
Would they?

01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:22.031
They wouldn't tell you, Frank.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.840
Look!

01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.190
We got one! Yes!

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.576
It's heading right towards us!

01:27:57.600 --> 01:27:59.192
Everyone take cover!

01:28:02.680 --> 01:28:03.874
Get down!

01:28:08.240 --> 01:28:09.240
Max!

01:28:36.280 --> 01:28:38.111
Will you get rid of everyone?

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.555
Yeah.

01:28:46.160 --> 01:28:47.309
Max.

01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.228
Tomorrow we have
a whole day with Anna.

01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.632
Let's forget the war.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:02.270
Let's make the best day ever.

01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:05.440
Yeah.

01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.633
I'd like that.

01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.594
Who's gonna jump first?

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:32.353
I've lit a fire. Come sit with us.

01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:33.869
This one?

01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.759
Flight Lieutenant!

01:31:09.440 --> 01:31:12.238
I have good news.
You have the night off.

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.589
Yes, sir.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.296
What the hell are you doing?
Why have you switched off the engine?

01:33:08.320 --> 01:33:09.719
Where is Paul Delamare?

01:33:10.600 --> 01:33:11.669
Paul Delamare???

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:13.234
He's in jail.

01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:13.911
What?

01:33:14.000 --> 01:33:15.433
Delamare is in jail.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:16.874
What? Gestapo?

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.159
No, local police.

01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.558
Drunk as usual.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:26.393
Take me to the jail.

01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:58.794
How many inside?

01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.558
This time of night, only one.

01:34:29.080 --> 01:34:30.593
I don't want any trouble!

01:34:32.120 --> 01:34:33.712
Where is Paul Delamare?

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:35.828
Cell number three.

01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:47.471
I don't want any trouble.

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:08.475
Open it.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.472
I'm sorry, Mr. Delamare.

01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:18.152
I'm sorry, Mr. Delamare.
I'm in a hurry.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.077
What I'm going to say is top secret.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.668
Do you speak English?

01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:27.234
No. Why?

01:35:28.680 --> 01:35:30.910
Look. Look closely.

01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.389
Is the woman in this photograph
Marianne Beauséjour?

01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:34.515
Who?

01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:36.838
Marianne Beauséjour!

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:41.959
Look! Is it her?

01:35:44.640 --> 01:35:46.073
Give me the bottle!

01:35:46.160 --> 01:35:47.718
Yes or no, and then you get a drink.

01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.154
Marianne Beauséjour?

01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:50.508
Marianne Beauséjour.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.716
Marianne Beauséjour...

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:54.309
Look!

01:35:57.720 --> 01:35:59.915
Yes. It's her.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:01.638
- Yes?
- Now let me have a drink.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:03.073
Look again. Are you sure?

01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.354
Fuck you!

01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:07.113
Look. Look!

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.311
- She look the same. Yeah.
- Yes?

01:36:09.480 --> 01:36:11.357
She laughs a lot. Brown hair.

01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:13.954
- And she has brown eyes, yes?
- Right. Brown eyes.

01:36:14.160 --> 01:36:16.310
She's got blue eyes!
God damn it, blue eyes!

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.913
Right! I mean blue.

01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.096
Don't you fuck with me, Delamare.

01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.792
I made a mistake.

01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.673
- Look!
- She has blue eyes.

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.993
I know her. Sure.

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.833
She is the life of the party.

01:36:31.680 --> 01:36:32.715
Go on.

01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.156
And she paints.

01:36:35.720 --> 01:36:37.711
Paints, yes. She paints what?

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.635
Wonderful watercolors.

01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:42.560
That's right.

01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.791
- Give me the bottle.
- That's right.

01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:46.960
The Krauts!

01:36:48.120 --> 01:36:51.351
And she plays the piano like a goddess.

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:54.708
Piano?

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:10.920
Don't move.

01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:18.399
Who wants some American cigarettes?

01:37:20.920 --> 01:37:21.920
Hey!

01:37:22.440 --> 01:37:23.839
Quoi?

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.070
Sometimes the Krauts...

01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:28.591
...they come to get American cigarettes.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:29.909
American cigarettes?

01:37:30.960 --> 01:37:32.916
We confiscate them from the Resistance.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.797
I remember Marianne.

01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:38.471
I remember when I met her.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:42.631
It was in a café. In Dordogne.

01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:46.472
The place was full of German soldiers.

01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:48.072
We gotta go!

01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.195
- We gotta go!
- Wait!

01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:51.471
There was a piano.

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:54.158
She went to it

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:56.436
and played La Marseillaise

01:37:56.800 --> 01:37:59.633
in front of all those Germans!

01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.160
Hey, Pierre!

01:38:25.160 --> 01:38:26.798
Lucky Strike?

01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.878
Do you have the cigarettes?

01:38:31.280 --> 01:38:32.474
Give them to him.

01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.951
Allo, Pierre?

01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:41.228
Pierre, c'est moi!

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.273
Behind the jail!

01:39:06.360 --> 01:39:08.954
The Resistance are running
behind the jail!

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:11.830
The Krauts are in the square!

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:14.517
A grenade.

01:40:50.280 --> 01:40:51.349
Marianne,

01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.470
I need you to come with me.

01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:02.232
Drop off Anna
and come with me now, please.

01:41:09.640 --> 01:41:11.631
What the hell are you doing?

01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:31.149
Marianne...

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.829
I want you to play the piano for me.

01:41:39.440 --> 01:41:41.078
You want what?

01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:45.912
Why on earth would you want me
to play the piano?

01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:51.033
I want you to play the piano
because I love you.

01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:56.270
What are you talking about?

01:41:56.600 --> 01:41:59.273
You haven't slept. Let's go home.

01:42:07.640 --> 01:42:10.029
I want you to play La Marseillaise.

01:42:14.040 --> 01:42:17.191
Now, you have asked me
some strange things...

01:42:17.560 --> 01:42:18.709
Play.

01:42:29.400 --> 01:42:32.790
Marianne Beauséjour
played La Marseillaise

01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:36.313
in a café full of Germans in '41.

01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.631
I want you to play it for me.

01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.191
I know the story.

01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:19.034
She was a very brave woman.

01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:27.034
I thought they wouldn't find me here.

01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:28.873
But they did.

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.271
And they threatened Anna.

01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:34.632
And I'm... And I'm so sorry.

01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:38.519
I am so sorry.

01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:43.039
Did you send it?

01:43:44.960 --> 01:43:47.110
The message! Did you send it?

01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:50.560
Yes.

01:44:01.080 --> 01:44:02.911
I'm sorry.

01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:08.833
I need to know,

01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:10.753
is this real?

01:44:12.000 --> 01:44:13.433
Do you love me?

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.830
I love you. I love you.

01:44:17.760 --> 01:44:20.752
I've loved you since Casablanca.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:31.833
Okay, listen to me. This is how it will be.

01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:34.510
There is a Medicine Hat

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:37.274
in Switzerland or Peru
or wherever the hell.

01:44:37.480 --> 01:44:39.152
We won't make it.

01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.154
If we stay one more hour,
V Section's gonna order me to kill you.

01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:46.440
And when I refuse,
they're gonna shoot us both.

01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:48.199
You understand?

01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:50.833
We go now.

01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.951
We have to get Anna.

01:45:08.560 --> 01:45:10.118
Where is Marianne?

01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.155
You used my child as collateral.

01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:22.234
You've done far worse,
Wing Commander Vatan.

01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:24.238
Who else is watching us?

01:45:24.320 --> 01:45:27.551
Ich bin einen
agent des Reiches.

01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:31.033
I will only give you my...

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.593
Come here, sweetheart.

01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:42.070
It's okay, honey. It's okay. It's okay.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.639
Very good, sir. You're free to pass.

01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.359
Wait here.

01:50:47.560 --> 01:50:49.312
It's over, Max!

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:54.038
The blue-dye came back positive.

01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:55.997
But you already know that, don't you?

01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:57.149
Frank, wait!

01:50:57.640 --> 01:50:59.915
Wait! Let me explain.

01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:02.834
- The circuit's been cleaned.
- Max Vatan,

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:05.390
in the name of
His Majesty King George VI...

01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:06.920
They had her boxed in, Frank!

01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:08.680
I charge you with high treason...

01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:09.994
No! Please!

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:12.276
...for aiding
and abetting the German spy

01:51:12.360 --> 01:51:14.078
known as Marianne Beauséjour.

01:51:14.240 --> 01:51:15.673
Frank, she had no choice.

01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:17.800
They threatened Anna.
They would have killed us all!

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:19.176
Max, have you lost your mind?

01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:20.349
She's a German spy!

01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.960
I won't let you do this, Frank.

01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.880
I've done my duty.
We've cleaned up the circuit.

01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:25.840
They had valuable
information, damn you!

01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.991
She had no choice!
They threatened Anna!

01:51:28.200 --> 01:51:29.997
If you want to walk away from this,

01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:33.275
then do what needs to be done.

01:51:33.440 --> 01:51:35.351
She had no choice.
They had her boxed in.

01:51:35.440 --> 01:51:37.112
They would've killed us all.

01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.953
The Section won't care.

01:51:39.120 --> 01:51:40.439
They threatened Anna!

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:43.273
For your child's sake,
don't throw your life away!

01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:45.670
We did our duty.
Just walk away.

01:51:45.800 --> 01:51:46.800
Walk away, Frank.

01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:48.000
Max.

01:51:53.560 --> 01:51:56.120
Je t'aime, mon Québécois.

01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.799
I love you.

01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.791
Take good care of her.

01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:21.513
Stand down.

01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:27.838
Wing Commander Vatan executed
the enemy agent with his own hand.

01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.516
That is how you will report it.

01:53:33.680 --> 01:53:35.352
That is an order.

01:54:18.080 --> 01:54:20.878
My dearest, darling Anna.

01:54:27.640 --> 01:54:30.996
I'm writing this
on a Sunday night in London.

01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:36.071
If you're reading this,

01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:38.311
then you barely knew me

01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:41.229
and may have no memory of who I am.

01:54:43.320 --> 01:54:45.231
I am your mother.

01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:49.911
You were born in an air raid
in the middle of a war

01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:53.673
to two people who loved each other.

01:54:56.520 --> 01:54:59.318
Our year together
in the house in Hampstead

01:54:59.400 --> 01:55:01.630
has been the happiest time of my life.

01:55:09.120 --> 01:55:11.509
Today you took your first steps.

01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:18.952
I am so grateful that I saw you walk
for the first time

01:55:19.040 --> 01:55:21.110
with your father by my side.

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:26.631
Max, my love,

01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:30.471
you are my world.

01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:39.392
I hope you will be able to forgive me.

01:55:41.320 --> 01:55:43.880
And I hope you make it to Medicine Hat.

01:55:48.160 --> 01:55:50.628
I have a picture of it in my mind,

01:55:51.640 --> 01:55:54.552
and I pray Anna's eyes will see it.

01:55:58.680 --> 01:56:00.671
My beautiful daughter,

01:56:02.160 --> 01:56:04.469
I love you with all my heart.

01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:10.833
I hope you will live your life in peace.

01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:17.676
I rest knowing your father
will take good care of you.

01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:25.235
I remain your loving mother,

01:56:27.560 --> 01:56:29.232
Marianne Vatan.
