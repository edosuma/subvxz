WEBVTT

00:47.297 --> 00:48.965
l've prepared all of your correspondence,

00:49.049 --> 00:52.051
and the summaries are here
for you to go over.

00:52.136 --> 00:54.011
You can put them down.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.767
Well, it's just... lt's 5:00.

01:00.352 --> 01:03.604
Sorry about that.
You probably want to be leaving.

01:05.315 --> 01:07.066
What are you up to?

01:07.818 --> 01:09.777
Well, some of the girls from here

01:09.862 --> 01:13.072
and the traveler's insurance
got a place in Saltaire.

01:13.157 --> 01:15.158
-Mosquitoes.
-They don't bother me.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.243
Some people they bother,
some people they don't.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.371
-l'm just one of those people.
-A thing like that.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.915
ls he making you work
because he's got no place to go?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.710
-No.
-Have a wonderful weekend, dear.

01:28.839 --> 01:31.174
Why is it that a man on his own
is an object of pity

01:31.258 --> 01:33.384
when she's really the one
you should feel sorry for?

01:33.469 --> 01:36.846
l don't feel sorry for her.
Those girls do whatever they want.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.766
Still working, Campbell?
There's no reason to show off.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.560
Cooper's in Montana, Sterling's in Jane

01:42.853 --> 01:45.313
-and Draper's on vacation.
-He's not on vacation.

01:45.397 --> 01:50.401
He's been in Dallas or Denver or something.
Hilton sent him to every armpit he has.

01:50.527 --> 01:53.404
l'd like to get out of town in August once,
even for work.

01:53.489 --> 01:55.490
l love this time of year.

01:55.699 --> 01:59.786
lt's quiet. lt used to be like this
when l was a kid all the time.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.289
l'd lie in bed at night, hear horses going by.

02:03.373 --> 02:07.043
New York in August?
lt's like a great, big, melting wax museum.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.961
Nothing but those fat girls
with the hairy armpits

02:09.046 --> 02:10.296
putting their feet in the fountain.

02:10.380 --> 02:13.591
You know what?
My weekend doesn't look so bad now.

02:14.176 --> 02:16.636
l'll take anybody for a drink who wants one.

02:20.891 --> 02:22.642
l poured you a beer.

02:25.979 --> 02:28.147
lf you were wondering,
there's a Hathaway in there.

02:28.232 --> 02:32.485
-The hotel gave me someone else's shirt.
-Then you should complain to Mr. Hilton.

02:32.569 --> 02:35.488
-They should be paying you for this.
-There's a hearing,

02:35.572 --> 02:37.990
and l'm paid well enough already.

02:40.035 --> 02:43.621
-What are they doing out there?
-Catching lightning bugs.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.458
You should join them.

03:27.457 --> 03:31.544
Yes, this is Elizabeth Draper
from the Junior League of Tarrytown

03:31.628 --> 03:34.088
calling for Mrs. Howard Englewood.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.884
We're trying to save
the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.

03:37.968 --> 03:40.177
When do you expect them back?

03:42.139 --> 03:43.931
Well, that's no good.

03:45.183 --> 03:47.184
Yes, have a good evening.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.700
Draper residence.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.663
Just a minute. Don. Come on, Don.
lt's for you.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.708
lt's Mr. Hilton's office.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.760
This is Don.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.679
Okay. When?

04:26.016 --> 04:27.516
Tuesday night.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.523
Pan Am? Sure, send it to my office.

04:37.444 --> 04:38.861
You as well.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.534
-Where are you going now?
-He wants me to fly out Tuesday night

04:45.619 --> 04:48.037
-and join him in Rome.
-Rome?

04:48.997 --> 04:53.000
-Well, that's a lot better than Dallas.
-Not for two days it isn't.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.753
l'll see the Colosseum from a taxicab.

04:56.755 --> 04:58.631
We should've gone to the beach
for the summer.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.467
You've been gone the whole time, anyway.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.762
First of all, that's not true.

05:04.846 --> 05:08.391
Second, there's nothing stopping you
from coming with me.

05:08.558 --> 05:12.561
-You have a passport.
-l guess our two-month-old isn't an issue.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.192
We can stay at the Waldorf
anytime we want.

05:19.319 --> 05:23.239
-Because that's just like Rome.
-Sorry, Birdie.

05:28.245 --> 05:30.413
l gotta catch up on my sleep.

05:38.547 --> 05:42.550
-Okay, you're all set. stand up.
-I am.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.662
Are you okay?

06:13.707 --> 06:17.877
-Are you trying to get that in or out?
-lt's stuck.

06:20.464 --> 06:23.758
-You work for the Lawrences, right?
-l'm very sorry.

06:25.177 --> 06:29.346
-You're their au pair, aren't you?
-Yes, but they will send me home.

06:31.433 --> 06:34.101
First of all, let's take care of this.

06:38.315 --> 06:40.691
-What happened?
-l can't tell you.

06:40.776 --> 06:42.651
-Yes, you can.
-l can't.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.281
What's your name?

06:48.200 --> 06:50.951
-Gudrun.
-My name is Peter.

06:51.495 --> 06:55.331
l'm in 14G.
And l'm not going to get you in trouble.

07:02.339 --> 07:06.342
l have this party and l borrowed her dress
and this happened.

07:06.676 --> 07:11.222
-No one can clean and she's coming home.
-So you thought you would throw it away?

07:11.306 --> 07:16.352
They're just going to think you stole it.
Whoa, whoa, wait. Hold on.

07:17.479 --> 07:20.106
l don't think you're thinking clearly.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.901
You could put it back in the closet,
and when she takes it out,

07:23.985 --> 07:26.821
blame it on the little kids.
They have a girl, right?

07:26.905 --> 07:28.823
l would never do this.

07:30.534 --> 07:33.410
-When are they coming home?
-Thursday.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.541
-Give it to me.
-For what?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.543
Just give it to me.

07:50.554 --> 07:53.305
-Let me see what l can do.
-Are you sure?

07:53.557 --> 07:57.309
-And people say New York's not friendly.
-Thank you.

07:57.811 --> 08:01.313
Now, l'm not promising anything.
l'll do my best.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.572
Good night.

09:21.269 --> 09:25.064
We've read your statement, Mrs. Gumport,
and we appreciate your concern.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.274
-So where is he? We're next.
-l don't know.

09:27.359 --> 09:30.903
-Did he say he was coming?
-l didn't speak to him exactly.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.572
Maybe he sent a letter,
a proclamation or something.

09:33.657 --> 09:37.701
l believe that completes our old business.
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

09:37.786 --> 09:42.790
We will begin with addressing the gas
station signs on South Water Street.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.585
Excuse me. l believe there's been
a request for discussion

09:46.670 --> 09:50.172
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir.
lt's on the agenda.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.302
Somehow that got shifted
into new business.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.930
That's definitely old business.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.017
-Who are you exactly?
-She's with me. l'm Mrs. Jack Farrelly,

10:02.102 --> 10:05.521
and we're representing
the Junior League of Tarrytown.

10:05.605 --> 10:10.359
-Would the trustees please locate the...
-There should be two petitions there.

10:14.906 --> 10:17.449
-Am l late?
-No, you're just in time.

10:18.493 --> 10:21.704
We have someone
who'd like to speak on our behalf.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.080
Yes.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.875
Yes. Mayor, trustees.

10:27.419 --> 10:32.131
l'm Henry Francis, Governor Rockefeller's
director of public relations and research,

10:32.215 --> 10:37.845
and l've been sent here to deliver this
request on behalf of the governor's office.

10:38.388 --> 10:41.473
-Really?
-lt's a request that further study is needed,

10:41.558 --> 10:43.934
because, as you know,
this project was initiated

10:44.019 --> 10:47.688
based on an assumption that
the water quality of the reservoir is lacking.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.274
l don't think that was an assumption.
There was a study.

10:50.358 --> 10:51.734
With all due respect,

10:51.818 --> 10:54.486
the governor's office believes
that was not conclusive.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.240
-May l see that letter?
-l've brought copies for everyone.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.341
Very well, Mr. Francis.

11:15.633 --> 11:18.927
We appreciate the governor's interest
in our hamlet,

11:19.220 --> 11:22.681
and do hereby order the development
of the Pleasantville Road Reservoir

11:22.766 --> 11:25.392
be suspended until further notice.

11:27.896 --> 11:32.107
Calm down, ladies.
l believe that completes our old business.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.942
Move onto the new business on the agenda.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.694
l am so impressed.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.864
-So how long will that report take?
-l have no idea,

11:38.948 --> 11:42.993
but there's a saying in politics,
"When you have no power, delay."

11:44.120 --> 11:47.956
-Betty says you're from around here.
-Yeah, about 3 miles that way.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.501
l have to get out of here
before Florence Esterhazi comes out

11:50.585 --> 11:54.880
-and reiterates the financial report.
-l should be getting back as well.

11:54.964 --> 11:57.299
-Are you driving to Albany?
-No.

11:58.343 --> 12:00.135
Well, l'm this way.

12:02.597 --> 12:06.350
-They say you can't fight city hall.
-Good night, Francine.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.149
Well, this is me.

12:15.318 --> 12:17.778
No station wagon for you, l guess.

12:17.862 --> 12:22.574
l have one. lt's just, this was my father's.
l thought it would be good luck.

12:31.334 --> 12:32.376
So.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.504
So what?

12:36.631 --> 12:37.756
Nothing.

12:37.841 --> 12:42.344
l'd love to buy you some coffee,
but l don't think there's any place open.

12:43.513 --> 12:46.890
l appreciate the offer,
but l should be getting home.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.195
l just want to say thank you.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.865
You really...

13:05.118 --> 13:09.288
You really did everything we wanted,
and l know how busy you must be.

13:09.372 --> 13:11.957
Well, l think you'll find
that l put my heart into things

13:12.041 --> 13:14.418
when something's important to me.

13:17.380 --> 13:18.755
Or someone.

13:28.391 --> 13:30.392
That is a beautiful car.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.395
He loved it.

13:36.858 --> 13:39.276
l saw how happy you were in there.

13:39.819 --> 13:44.615
-l was. l am.
-And l thought, "Dear God.

13:46.409 --> 13:49.036
"Did l have anything to do with that?"

13:50.413 --> 13:52.831
Because that would make me happy.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.002
You did.

14:23.988 --> 14:26.532
-Good night.
-Drive safely now.

14:56.813 --> 14:59.356
Do you know what happened
to the Hilton cufflinks?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.108
They're little Stetsons, sterling silver.

15:01.192 --> 15:05.362
They're in my top drawer.
Bobby was playing with them. They're fine.

15:06.114 --> 15:10.033
-Look at that. How'd it go?
-lt went very well. We won.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.869
We won, we won, we won!

15:17.667 --> 15:21.420
-What time are you leaving?
-Car comes at 5:45.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.381
-You're leaving from work?
-Yes.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.723
-So they just killed the whole development?
-Not exactly.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.308
We had completely forgotten this,

15:34.392 --> 15:37.352
but there's a man
from the governor's office,

15:37.604 --> 15:39.229
and he pointed out
something we'd forgotten,

15:39.314 --> 15:41.565
which was that the whole project
was based on the idea

15:41.649 --> 15:45.193
that the water's no good up there anymore,
which is a lie.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.989
lt's not true at all, not even a little.
They just made it up.

15:49.073 --> 15:53.744
So he ordered another study, you know,
like a chemical analysis of the water,

15:54.120 --> 15:57.706
and that could take years,
so l think they'll move on.

16:00.168 --> 16:04.046
They should just do it up in Newburgh.
lt's already disgusting.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.589
That's real politics.

16:05.673 --> 16:10.052
Well, you know, when you don't
have any power, you have to delay things.

16:27.153 --> 16:31.365
Don.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.911
-l'm up. l'm up.
-No, it's not time to wake up.

16:38.539 --> 16:41.249
l want to come with you. ls it too late?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.127
What? No.

16:45.088 --> 16:49.758
-l can buy you a ticket at the airport.
-Carla can watch them for a few days.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.178
Sure, why not?

16:53.680 --> 16:58.266
l know you'll be working the whole time,
but l just want to get on a plane.

17:11.656 --> 17:13.156
Pardon me. Do you work here?

17:13.241 --> 17:15.367
The men's room is exactly here,
one floor down.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.036
No, l don't need the men's room. l...

17:25.628 --> 17:28.296
l can't return this. lt has this stain here.

17:28.381 --> 17:31.341
l spilled wine on it
and my wife hasn't forgiven me,

17:31.426 --> 17:34.386
and l'd really appreciate
if you could get me out of the doghouse.

17:34.470 --> 17:37.556
l'm sorry, but anyone
could've sewn a tag in this and...

17:37.640 --> 17:40.600
Do l look like someone
who wants to steal a dress?

17:40.685 --> 17:43.895
-l'll pay for it.
-And l was going to say if we did carry it,

17:43.980 --> 17:47.733
it would be from last season,
and l don't know that we still have it.

17:47.817 --> 17:51.361
-Let me speak to the manager.
-Of the entire store?

17:51.696 --> 17:53.572
Of the republic of dresses.

17:53.656 --> 17:57.409
Whoever can help me with this,
because you're falling short.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.328
Just a minute.

18:14.844 --> 18:17.179
-May l help you?
-Yes, l...

18:18.181 --> 18:20.557
Joan! ls that you?

18:21.726 --> 18:25.020
Yes. Yes, it is. How are you?

18:26.189 --> 18:27.981
l'm well. Thank you.

18:29.442 --> 18:32.319
l was asking for the manager. l had no idea.

18:32.403 --> 18:35.864
Well, l'm just filling in.
They needed some extra help.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.993
-l get my pick before they get put out.
-lsn't that smart?

18:40.286 --> 18:44.498
-So how can l help you?
-Well, l don't mean to be a bother,

18:44.791 --> 18:48.168
l was just hoping someone could.
lt's this dress.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.464
Trudy spilled wine on it.
She's beside herself.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.633
l may have spilled the wine,

18:54.717 --> 18:57.093
and l was hoping to exchange it
or replace it,

18:57.178 --> 18:59.805
whichever will get me out
of the ladies dresses department.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.056
May l?

19:02.934 --> 19:04.810
lt is our merchandise.

19:05.061 --> 19:11.024
-This one's small. l don't see Trudy in a 1 0.
-lt doesn't fit great, but she loves it.

19:11.442 --> 19:13.944
-lt's very...
-lt's very summery.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.655
Give me a moment.

19:25.414 --> 19:29.918
Take this down to customer service.
They'll send someone to the stockroom.

19:30.086 --> 19:33.380
-lt'll be boxed up, but l'm sure we have it.
-l'm willing to pay for it, of course.

19:33.464 --> 19:37.342
-lt's all taken care of.
-Well, that's very generous.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.346
Thank you. So how are you?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.891
Never been better.
How are things at the office?

19:44.976 --> 19:46.643
Moneypenny hasn't self-destructed,

19:46.727 --> 19:49.813
but it's just a matter of time.
And how are you?

19:50.189 --> 19:54.985
l think l told you already. l'm very well.
Greg is just finishing up his residency.

19:55.069 --> 19:56.736
He's actually thinking about
a new specialty.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.823
You know doctors.
Whatever's the latest thing.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.033
And what would that be?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.578
Psychiatry.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.374
l'll take the dress and you take that.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.919
Thank you so much
for getting me out of a scrape.

20:13.129 --> 20:14.588
And l'd appreciate it

20:14.672 --> 20:18.133
if you should happen to run into Trudy
that you be discreet.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.385
The whole incident was fraught with drama.

20:20.469 --> 20:23.179
Of course. This never happened.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.517
Nice to see you again.

20:42.617 --> 20:43.700
Wow.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.494
lt's beautiful.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.835
-What is that smell?
-Which one?

20:55.880 --> 20:58.006
lt's like rubber or diesel.

20:59.425 --> 21:02.677
l can barely stand up.
Let me see what's going on.

21:44.929 --> 21:46.513
Sorry. l haven't changed my money yet.

21:46.597 --> 21:50.016
No, signore. Thank you.
American dollar is very good.

21:50.393 --> 21:51.726
Thank you.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.733
$2, Don? That's what he makes in a week.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.490
Don, look.

22:17.670 --> 22:21.214
-I'm sorry. Is this the Drapers' room?
-Yes, this is Mrs. Draper.

22:21.632 --> 22:25.051
ls it? Well, it's high time l got to meet you.

22:26.178 --> 22:28.138
This must be Mr. Hilton.

22:29.724 --> 22:30.724
Connie. Please.

22:31.851 --> 22:34.978
-Welcome to Rome.
-Thank you. l'm happy to be here.

22:35.479 --> 22:38.273
l want you to put my staff
through its traces.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.526
No complaint's too small.
l'd kick you up to a suite,

22:41.610 --> 22:44.195
but l want Don to see the way this works
for most people.

22:45.114 --> 22:47.282
-lt's lovely.
-When I see you tonight,

22:47.700 --> 22:49.868
l want to hear all about it.

23:42.838 --> 23:46.216
l so, so appreciate this.
lt's an hour or two at the most.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.426
The board is trying to jap us
with a sudden meeting.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.345
Ernie, l'm leaving!

24:15.496 --> 24:19.290
You're drinking alone.
This is, in Rome, not in the law.

25:15.556 --> 25:17.056
Whiskey, neat.

25:21.395 --> 25:24.898
-May l join you?
-Yankee. Hey, go home.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.942
lt's an American millionaire.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.825
-Are they making fun of me?
-A little bit.

25:38.287 --> 25:42.123
l'm only in Rome for one night.
l won't have my heart broken.

25:59.475 --> 26:02.769
-Room 763.
-That's right near my room.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.316
Good night, signorina.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.659
-To whatever they were saying.
-They said you were ugly.

26:20.162 --> 26:21.996
Does that bother you?

26:23.040 --> 26:26.584
You think because of the way l'm dressed
that l'm shallow?

26:26.669 --> 26:29.045
l was just hoping you were easy.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.841
-They said that, too.
-What brings you to Rome?

26:37.179 --> 26:39.222
Seen anything interesting?

26:43.519 --> 26:48.564
-l could take it or leave it.
-Well, look at the lovebirds, will you?

26:50.442 --> 26:52.735
Connie, this is my wife, Betty.

26:57.908 --> 27:00.868
By golly, you are an indecently lucky man.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.544
By golly, he's nutty.

27:12.298 --> 27:13.881
He's something.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.302
He adores you.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.724
You're tiny.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.351
He does.

27:25.936 --> 27:28.521
Now l can see
what all the fuss has been about.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.773
He sees great things in you.

28:53.315 --> 28:56.067
-Where are we going?
-We're going for ice cream.

28:56.151 --> 28:57.902
That's a grand idea.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.947
Close your window.
My hair is getting mussed.

29:01.824 --> 29:03.825
-How was your day?
-Okay.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.994
-Do l look pretty?
-l guess so.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.582
Hey, what are you doing?

29:11.667 --> 29:14.752
Sally and Ernie sitting in a tree.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.715
K-l-S-S-l-N-G...

29:19.800 --> 29:21.008
Shut up! l mean it!

29:21.093 --> 29:22.218
First comes love...

29:22.302 --> 29:23.761
-Shut up!
-Then comes...

29:23.846 --> 29:25.054
Stop it!

29:26.140 --> 29:30.017
-l said shut up!
-Hey, hey, hey! That's enough!

29:32.062 --> 29:34.856
-She hurt me.
-He hit me first.

29:35.232 --> 29:37.650
-She was kissing Ernie.
-l was not!

29:37.734 --> 29:40.611
All right! Both of you, separate rooms.

29:41.363 --> 29:44.574
l'm not gonna let Ernie and Jessica
visit anymore.

29:56.795 --> 30:01.591
Well, aren't you a lucky girl?
Go ahead, open it. Make sure it's right.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.685
lt's like new!

30:12.769 --> 30:15.730
They just exchanged it. No questions asked.

30:16.315 --> 30:19.484
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Peter, from my heart.

30:20.402 --> 30:24.614
-l promise l never do this again.
-lt's all right. lt never happened.

30:24.907 --> 30:26.699
We should celebrate.

30:27.826 --> 30:30.244
-l don't know.
-What do you like to drink?

30:30.329 --> 30:34.582
You're German, right?
l can get us some beer or a Riesling.

30:35.375 --> 30:36.626
Schnapps?

30:38.587 --> 30:40.213
You are so nice,

30:41.548 --> 30:43.508
but l have my boyfriend.

30:46.428 --> 30:48.971
Thank you so much to do this for me.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.517
Glad l could help.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.480
Good night.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.810
-l woke you.
-What do you want?

31:37.020 --> 31:39.564
l went to a lot of trouble
to solve your dress problem,

31:39.648 --> 31:42.733
and l think l at least deserve
to see it on you.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.863
Okay, but you have to be very quiet.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.379
-This is cozy.
-l'll go get the dress.

32:13.473 --> 32:15.266
l'd like to kiss you.

32:42.461 --> 32:45.087
-Hello?
-Did l wake you?

32:46.840 --> 32:50.635
-No. No, l'm up.
-Can I interest you two in some breakfast?

32:52.929 --> 32:55.264
Breakfast? Sure, let me just...

32:56.058 --> 32:57.141
Stay.

32:57.351 --> 33:02.313
You know, Connie, Betty's telling me she
already ordered breakfast up to the room.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.899
-Can l meet you afterwards?
-Of course.

33:05.359 --> 33:07.568
You let me know
how you like the room service.

33:12.574 --> 33:15.534
-Did you hear the bells this morning?
-l did.

33:17.496 --> 33:20.247
l like sleeping on this side of the bed.

33:35.847 --> 33:37.473
l have to get up.

33:44.356 --> 33:47.316
Order something. He wants a full report.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.559
Well, hello.

34:22.352 --> 34:23.811
Welcome home.

34:25.021 --> 34:28.482
-How is everybody?
-Everyone's fine. How was your trip?

34:28.734 --> 34:30.818
lt was short but sweet.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.321
Well, good. l'm going to get my things.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.033
Just one more thing.

34:38.910 --> 34:41.537
-You might want to talk to Sally.
-Why?

34:41.747 --> 34:44.665
-She'll tell you.
-Carla, you brought it up.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.878
l keep talking to her about that temper.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.840
l'm gonna go check the mail.
Do you want anything?

34:54.843 --> 34:59.680
She kissed Ernie Hanson. Bobby was
teasing her, and she really went after him.

35:01.475 --> 35:03.058
Okay. lt's okay.

35:04.186 --> 35:07.730
-Thank you for telling me.
-l think they just missed you.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.815
Wouldn't that be nice?

35:12.903 --> 35:15.362
Well, l missed you. You know that?

35:28.210 --> 35:30.711
Mr. Campbell. Ed Lawrence, 14C.

35:32.214 --> 35:34.548
Yes, of course. How are you, Ed?

35:35.717 --> 35:38.594
-ls your wife at home?
-No.

35:40.222 --> 35:43.182
-Can l come in for a minute?
-Of course.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.942
-What are you drinking, Ed?
-l have a martini waiting next door.

35:53.068 --> 35:54.360
Let me make this quick.

35:54.444 --> 35:57.279
You know we have this German au pair
working for us?

35:57.364 --> 35:59.907
-No, l didn't know that.
-Yes, you do.

36:02.160 --> 36:05.412
-l don't know what she said...
-Please, just relax.

36:06.414 --> 36:09.375
l know it's August and all the cats are away,

36:09.459 --> 36:13.671
but l just spent one of my precious
vacation days refilling the Kleenex boxes.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.423
-l don't understand.
-Would you drop it?

36:17.175 --> 36:21.595
l've had four months without any tears,
Mr. Campbell. Four quiet months.

36:21.763 --> 36:25.683
You know how hard it is to find someone
my wife can get along with?

36:25.767 --> 36:27.226
And now this.

36:31.565 --> 36:35.651
Look, there are plenty of nannies
in this neighborhood.

36:35.861 --> 36:40.114
Stay away from her.
ln fact, be smart. Stay out of the building.

36:42.117 --> 36:44.493
-l'm very sorry.
-lt'll be fine.

36:46.371 --> 36:48.622
Enjoy the rest of your summer.

36:57.632 --> 37:00.009
-Bobby, sit down.
-Mayday! Mayday!

37:07.309 --> 37:08.893
Daddy doesn't know,

37:08.977 --> 37:12.479
but Carla told me you were fighting
while we were gone.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.482
Sally.

37:16.359 --> 37:19.904
-Carla was very upset.
-lt's not fair. l didn't do anything.

37:19.988 --> 37:23.574
That's it. You apologize to Bobby
and you learn to control your temper,

37:23.658 --> 37:26.869
or l'm going to have
to start taking things away.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.707
-l'm sorry l hit you.
-That's okay.

37:37.005 --> 37:41.008
l called the office. Hilton sent a packet over
before we even left.

37:41.092 --> 37:42.426
l'm sorry.

37:43.094 --> 37:45.512
-Going swimming?
-Are we?

37:47.140 --> 37:48.182
Yes.

37:57.734 --> 37:59.360
See you tonight.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.122
Yes, but what you really would've enjoyed

38:12.207 --> 38:15.417
was watching my father struggle
with the sailboat.

38:17.629 --> 38:19.046
Well, hello.

38:20.298 --> 38:21.507
Hello.

38:23.218 --> 38:27.137
-ls everybody having a good summer?
-Very nice. Very hot.

38:37.357 --> 38:41.318
l see Marta came.
Or did you keep it this way yourself?

38:47.242 --> 38:51.412
-l did my best.
-My little bachelor. Come over here.

39:07.429 --> 39:08.929
l missed you.

39:10.223 --> 39:13.350
l missed every part of you.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.604
-Trudy, l have to get to work.
-l don't care.

39:23.820 --> 39:24.987
Peter.

39:26.781 --> 39:31.201
You always get that guilty look
on your face when we see little children.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.037
l told you.

39:33.997 --> 39:35.456
l don't care.

39:36.750 --> 39:40.044
You're my husband. l want what you want.

39:45.341 --> 39:47.426
Did you miss me? A little?

39:53.850 --> 39:55.309
What's wrong?

40:00.398 --> 40:03.901
Peter. Look at me. Did something happen?

40:28.343 --> 40:31.678
-Sally, get down here.
-Coming.

40:47.779 --> 40:52.116
l want you to know that l think
Ernie Hanson is a very nice little boy,

40:52.951 --> 40:56.370
but l don't want you running around
just kissing boys.

40:57.705 --> 41:01.250
-l wasn't.
-And you don't kiss boys. Boys kiss you.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.880
The first kiss is very special.

41:07.841 --> 41:10.551
But l already did it. lt's over.

41:14.764 --> 41:17.683
You're going to have a lot of first kisses.

41:18.143 --> 41:21.603
You're going to want it to be special,
so you remember.

41:25.525 --> 41:29.236
lt's where you go from being a stranger
to knowing someone,

41:30.155 --> 41:34.158
and every kiss with him after that
is a shadow of that kiss.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.331
Do you understand?

41:43.918 --> 41:45.294
l think so.

41:48.381 --> 41:49.590
Go play.

42:14.032 --> 42:16.241
-Hello.
-Hello.

42:17.243 --> 42:20.871
l made some cold salads,
hearts of palm, tomatoes, olives.

42:21.539 --> 42:22.873
Wonderful.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.250
-Do you want a drink?
-No.

42:28.880 --> 42:32.591
l walked down Lexington
and they opened a new fruit market,

42:32.759 --> 42:34.968
but other than the melons,
most of it was unremarkable,

42:35.053 --> 42:37.512
so l stopped in Butterfield Market

42:37.680 --> 42:41.391
and they had all of the stone fruits
and beautiful cherries and l thought...

42:41.476 --> 42:44.853
-Trudy.
-...maybe l'd make a fruit salad for dessert.

42:48.733 --> 42:49.816
What?

42:51.903 --> 42:54.988
l don't want you to go away anymore
without me.

43:07.585 --> 43:10.003
Good. l won't.

43:23.768 --> 43:26.353
Tell me, what happened at work today?

43:28.481 --> 43:31.525
Well, Kinsey invented some contraption

43:31.609 --> 43:34.111
that can shoot a water balloon
across the office.

43:34.195 --> 43:37.155
-We filled it with ketchup.
-Did you?

43:39.534 --> 43:43.120
l have $5 for Carla.
She watched the kids for me.

43:43.371 --> 43:46.373
The board called a secret meeting
about the reservoir.

43:46.457 --> 43:48.917
-l think they reversed us.
-Really?

43:49.711 --> 43:51.044
We'll see.

43:52.046 --> 43:56.883
-So did you go to the catacombs?
-No.

43:58.386 --> 44:00.554
Throw a coin in the fountain?

44:02.098 --> 44:06.184
-You did have a good time, didn't you?
-You want some?

44:06.686 --> 44:09.855
The kids didn't eat it at all.
l put them to bed.

44:11.607 --> 44:15.610
Carlton and l went to Lake George
for a week after Jess was born.

44:16.946 --> 44:18.739
No problems, no kids.

44:20.825 --> 44:22.367
lt was magical.

44:24.746 --> 44:26.747
We have to do that again.

44:28.875 --> 44:32.502
l'm afraid we may have to be vigilant
about the reservoir.

44:32.962 --> 44:37.883
Although, it'd be an excuse for you
to get more help from high places.

44:39.594 --> 44:42.429
l'm done with that. We made our stand.

44:43.973 --> 44:47.768
Sunny Madrid. Doesn't that sound
like it would do the trick?

44:49.187 --> 44:50.771
l've never been.

44:56.778 --> 44:59.363
-Welcome home.
-Hello, Francine.

45:02.075 --> 45:03.784
Well, l should be going.

45:03.868 --> 45:06.787
From what l hear,
you two must be very tired.

45:08.623 --> 45:10.415
Good night, Francine.

45:26.808 --> 45:28.809
-Hey.
-Don't.

45:31.521 --> 45:33.647
-What's wrong?
-What's wrong?

45:34.148 --> 45:36.817
l hate this place. l hate our friends.

45:37.151 --> 45:39.236
-l hate this town.
-Betts.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.116
We'll go away again. You know we will.

45:47.286 --> 45:49.913
Do me a favor. Look on your pillow.

45:58.047 --> 45:59.297
Open it.

46:03.344 --> 46:04.970
l saw it in the gift shop,

46:05.054 --> 46:08.014
but we were leaving,
so l had Connie send it.

46:10.309 --> 46:11.685
lt's lovely.

46:13.354 --> 46:15.814
l'll have it put on your bracelet.

46:20.528 --> 46:22.279
Then l can have something to look at

46:22.363 --> 46:25.740
when l tell the story
about the time we went to Rome.
