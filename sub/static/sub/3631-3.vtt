00:05.163 --> 00:06.487
(Snarling)

00:06.488 --> 00:09.886
Whoever this is, they broke a cardinal
rule by killing a human for sport.

00:09.887 --> 00:12.722
- We'll deal with this as a Pack.
- The Pack needs you.

00:12.793 --> 00:15.691
You're going to have to do better
than that if we're tracking a Mutt.

00:15.692 --> 00:17.222
Miss you, too.

00:17.223 --> 00:19.231
Elena: I have people who
like to know where I am.

00:19.233 --> 00:22.081
- People or person?
- It's not as if you care.

00:22.571 --> 00:24.170
(Growl)
(Scream)

00:24.172 --> 00:27.239
Elena: Another killing.
It almost smells newly turned.

00:27.241 --> 00:28.641
You're gonna want to see this.

00:28.643 --> 00:31.310
- What is it?
- He's just a child.

00:37.116 --> 00:40.930
Elena: This kill, it's the same scent
as the Mutt from the flophouse.

00:40.932 --> 00:43.166
It's the same one that
killed the girl before.

00:43.168 --> 00:46.081
And now a young boy.
This has got to stop.

00:46.391 --> 00:47.791
What are you doing?

00:47.793 --> 00:51.094
He dumped him here to put a target
on our backs. We have to move him.

00:51.096 --> 00:53.163
(High-pitched ring)
(Distant men's voices)

00:53.165 --> 00:55.013
There's hunters
on our property.

00:55.733 --> 00:58.268
(Panting)

00:58.270 --> 00:59.846
He's got the scent.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.144
Trespassing won't matter
if they find this.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.241
Nick, help me
move him.

01:04.242 --> 01:05.975
No, leave the
body there.

01:05.977 --> 01:07.777
If they find a body, we'll
be overrun with police.

01:07.779 --> 01:11.047
It's gonna be a lot worse if
they catch us trying to cover this up.

01:11.049 --> 01:13.516
(Continued shouts)

01:20.758 --> 01:24.084
My god... It's a kid.

01:24.428 --> 01:27.963
- What the hell did you people do?
- We had nothing to do with this.

01:30.634 --> 01:32.468
It's the Richardson boy.

01:32.470 --> 01:34.617
We just found the body. I was
about to call the police.

01:34.618 --> 01:37.963
- Looks like another wolf attack.
- Yeah? We'll let the Sheriff decide that.

01:37.964 --> 01:41.332
In the meantime, we'll stick around, make
sure no one messes with the evidence.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.968
Believe me, we have no intention
of tampering with evidence.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.962
The best thing is for everybody
to just back away from the boy's body.

01:46.963 --> 01:48.163
We will wait
for the police.

01:48.164 --> 01:50.431
Look, I don't know what you
people are doing out here,

01:50.433 --> 01:53.067
but this is the second wolf
kill in a couple of days

01:53.068 --> 01:55.302
and you've got goddamn tracks
all over your property.

01:55.303 --> 01:56.670
It's private
property.

01:56.672 --> 01:59.807
Maybe you'd like to explain what
the Richardson boy is doing out here.

01:59.809 --> 02:00.762
Braxton...

02:00.763 --> 02:03.132
Clay: You're implying what's
happened here is our fault?

02:03.134 --> 02:05.941
Dead body, your property:
you do the math.

02:05.942 --> 02:08.965
We have nothing to do with this.
Anybody who thinks that is a fool.

02:08.966 --> 02:11.167
- You're calling me a fool?
- Easy...

02:11.326 --> 02:13.476
Everybody just
calm down now.

02:13.478 --> 02:16.045
(Barking)

02:16.047 --> 02:18.590
- Man: Calm down, calm down!
- Blue! Stop!

02:18.591 --> 02:20.524
It's time
for you to go.

02:20.525 --> 02:22.459
(Click)

02:22.569 --> 02:24.469
(Grunt) Hey, what the hell?

02:24.470 --> 02:26.708

(Panting)

02:26.709 --> 02:29.076
What the hell? Blue!

02:29.324 --> 02:34.359
Next time you pop the safety off your
gun, I'm gonna give you reason to use it.

02:35.443 --> 02:37.560
That's enough.

02:37.967 --> 02:39.952
Enough.

02:40.523 --> 02:44.263
The most important thing is to do right
by this boy and his family now.

02:45.344 --> 02:46.643
Antonio and Nick,

02:46.645 --> 02:49.432
escort these gentlemen to the front
gate and you wait for the sheriff.

02:49.433 --> 02:50.683
- Blue!
- Hey, come...

02:50.684 --> 02:54.095
Braxton! The damn dog
will find his own way home.

02:58.059 --> 02:59.892
(Spit)

03:00.137 --> 03:03.211
Braxton: We'll see what the sheriff
has to say about this.

03:04.057 --> 03:06.355
Man: Come on, let's
get out of here.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.405
Who would do this
to a child?

03:09.610 --> 03:11.309
That's what we have
to find out.

03:14.914 --> 03:16.882

Goading the dog
was very clever, Elena.

04:04.736 --> 04:07.131
That dog could
have attacked you.

04:07.169 --> 04:09.962
You act like I've never
been bitten before.

04:10.321 --> 04:13.389
- How ironic.
- If you're angry at me, come at me.

04:13.390 --> 04:15.568
- Right at me. Don't talk around it.
- That's enough.

04:15.569 --> 04:18.767
- Pete: The hunters are off the property.
- For now, anyway.

04:18.769 --> 04:22.065
At the rate that this Mutt's going,
that's not going to last for very long.

04:22.065 --> 04:24.532
The first kill was on
the outskirts of town,

04:24.533 --> 04:27.461
the second one was dropped
in our backyard, what's his plan?

04:27.462 --> 04:30.845
He's drawing attention to us and
he's upped the stakes by killing a kid.

04:30.846 --> 04:33.730
He's escalating. He's turning
up the heat, bit by bit.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.973
But why?

04:34.974 --> 04:38.635
The psychological damage to the recently
bitten Mutt is unpredictable.

04:38.636 --> 04:40.712
Yeah, except for the fact
that he's targeting us.

04:40.713 --> 04:42.715
Or he just likes to kill
women and children

04:42.717 --> 04:44.383
and wants to flaunt
it in our territory.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.930
Sheriff just arrived.
She's heading out to see the body.

04:47.931 --> 04:49.598
Look...

04:49.822 --> 04:52.188
A Mutt killed a kid.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.660
I'll stay
until we find him.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.796

- I'll be ready in five minutes.
- I want him alive.

05:12.557 --> 05:15.469
I need to know who turned him
before we mete out punishment.

05:15.470 --> 05:18.688
There is someone out there who knows
the Mutt rumour mill better than us.

05:18.689 --> 05:21.620
- Karl Marsten.
- If he's even in the country.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.206
Find out,
Nick.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.891
If he is, I want you and Logan
to track him down and see what he knows.

Got it.

Well, hey, I'll just stick around
here and do some sweeping up.

I can clean out the
fireplace, too if...

A show of force. Hear that?

Our whole existence hinges

07:08.645 --> 07:11.517
We have to keep some

you two in town.

Bill Richardson's.

there a bunch of times.

a new place to fill up for a while.

much to stop it.

- Well, his dog's still missing.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.259
Why?

13:24.986 --> 13:27.313
Maybe he made his
point and left town?

13:27.336 --> 13:29.699

he's gone mad with the Change.

waiting for our call.

39:01.513 --> 39:03.444

an opportunity.

39:03.445 --> 39:04.617
And money.

39:04.618 --> 39:07.238
You and I are gonna follow
his financial tracks.

All right. Get your stuff.

39:11.922 --> 39:15.919

opinion on the lasagna?

39:15.920 --> 39:19.364

anybody else does the cooking.

39:19.365 --> 39:21.479
- I don't critique.
- Right.

39:21.480 --> 39:24.328

39:30.507 --> 39:32.774
How are you two doing?

39:32.776 --> 39:35.811
Logan doesn't
really say much.

39:35.813 --> 39:39.181
I've... (Laugh) got
these crazy hours.

39:39.183 --> 39:41.150
You know, prepping the
kitchen at 9:00 a.m.,

39:41.152 --> 39:44.253
not getting home until 1:00
in the morning at the earliest.

39:44.255 --> 39:47.288

39:47.290 --> 39:50.459
Logan... I don't know,
he... gets it.

39:50.461 --> 39:54.863
- He gives me room.
- And you give him room.

39:54.865 --> 39:59.334
Yeah. But... now I'm curious
about the rest of his family.

39:59.336 --> 40:01.936
I don't know. They're
not what you'd expect.

40:01.938 --> 40:06.740
For a while there, I felt...
I don't know, like I was at home.

40:06.742 --> 40:10.528
But I couldn't shake the feeling
that I was just a visitor.

40:11.114 --> 40:12.680

40:12.682 --> 40:15.590

somebody there, right?

40:16.986 --> 40:18.597
Yeah.

40:26.282 --> 40:29.538
Tell me something, and
if I'm prying, I'll back off.

40:29.539 --> 40:32.819

okay with Elena?

40:34.544 --> 40:35.744
Uh...

40:37.626 --> 40:40.327
What makes you
think it isn't?

40:40.329 --> 40:43.731
She has a hard time opening up,
and I never push her,

40:43.733 --> 40:48.004
but she's shared enough of her past that
I know she's holding in a lot of hurt.

40:48.571 --> 40:53.307
Well, and it really isn't
my place to say, but...

40:53.309 --> 40:57.034
I see you two together,
the way you make her laugh.

40:58.449 --> 41:02.283
You bring out the best side of her.
Just keep doing that.

41:02.787 --> 41:04.286
Look at me.

41:04.288 --> 41:07.722
