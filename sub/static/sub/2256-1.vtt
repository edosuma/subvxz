Third bro.

02:56.751 --> 02:58.336
Third bro.

02:59.671 --> 03:01.590
You're not lucky as I am.

03:26.991 --> 03:28.993
- General!
- Who are you?

03:29.118 --> 03:30.954
Liang's soldier.

05:23.946 --> 05:30.286
<i>One main road
leads to homecoming</i>

05:31.162 --> 05:37.586
<i>My home is right at
the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

05:38.795 --> 05:45.552
<i>Soils are rich there
5 acres of farms</i>

05:45.844 --> 05:47.304
Pretty good.

05:47.554 --> 05:53.519
<i>5 acres of farm
What to grow?</i>

06:01.110 --> 06:02.153
Let me tell you something.

06:02.278 --> 06:04.906
When I was a boy, I caught a boar.
My dad had me let go of it.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.699
You know why?

06:06.908 --> 06:08.952
There were boys
inside that belly.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.912
You have boys?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.668
You know what,

06:17.419 --> 06:20.589
you're my captive now.
Hey, hey.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.551
You've lost few blood.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.970
Not a big deal.

06:28.931 --> 06:31.183
This is the drug developed
by my family.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.477
Don't spare this to anyone.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.941
You hurt?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.652
Now it gonna hurt more.

06:43.988 --> 06:46.491
You're welcome, young man!

06:46.741 --> 06:49.369
You'll live, you know.

06:50.954 --> 06:52.622
And don't curse.

06:58.795 --> 07:00.088
My dad said,

07:00.297 --> 07:04.426
Scratch when you're itchy,
Smile when you ain't lucky!

07:08.055 --> 07:09.473
Pretty good.

07:40.881 --> 07:42.507
General.

07:46.470 --> 07:47.638
Deputy General Yu.

07:47.763 --> 07:49.098
Yes, I am.

07:49.223 --> 07:51.392
Hang on a sec.

07:52.726 --> 07:54.895
Why you're here?

07:55.396 --> 07:57.565
In pursuit of Liang's men.

08:00.943 --> 08:04.072
In pursuit?
How many have you killed?

08:04.113 --> 08:05.323
Speak.

08:05.657 --> 08:06.824
One.

08:06.950 --> 08:09.661
- My men must fight hard.
- Liang's came hard on us...

08:09.869 --> 08:11.246
Defend our nation with our lives.

08:11.371 --> 08:15.208
- Please, for the sake of...
- AWOL personnel must face penalty.

08:15.458 --> 08:19.671
General, my company was
all gone last night.

08:19.838 --> 08:23.383
Gone? I was there last night.

08:23.592 --> 08:25.802
In fact, we were ambushed.

08:25.928 --> 08:28.347
And you were the traitor.

08:40.275 --> 08:42.403
You're so cruel.

08:42.528 --> 08:45.239
He saved your life, and you took his.

08:46.783 --> 08:48.201
Hey, hey, hey,

08:48.368 --> 08:50.411
what you gonna do?

08:51.329 --> 08:52.580
He was right.

08:52.664 --> 08:54.791
You're all dead.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.668
Kill me.

08:56.751 --> 08:58.753
I don't kill POW.

08:59.504 --> 09:03.508
Now, keep begging. I might let
you go, if you tried hard enough.

09:03.592 --> 09:05.594
Just kill me.

09:06.970 --> 09:08.555
You really want to die?

09:08.931 --> 09:10.808
Here, let me help you.

09:16.564 --> 09:17.732
Too bad,

09:18.816 --> 09:21.319
I failed my mission.

09:45.010 --> 09:48.764
Want to die?
Die another day!

10:04.113 --> 10:07.867
Prince Wen, we've accomplished.

10:08.743 --> 10:13.123
Like he said, to die with
dignity in a battle field.

10:13.540 --> 10:14.791
You're AWOL.

10:14.958 --> 10:17.085
Not exactly. Just playing dead.

10:17.168 --> 10:19.129
My dad said, no shame for
living to fight another day,

10:19.296 --> 10:20.630
only for being dead in vain.

10:20.797 --> 10:23.759
Poor Third bro didn't listen to me.
He refused to play dead.

10:23.842 --> 10:26.303
- How much am I worth?
- It doesn't hurt to tell you.

10:26.512 --> 10:29.056
General alive: 5 acres of farm land.

10:29.264 --> 10:30.474
5 acres.

10:30.557 --> 10:32.726
I have a jade medal in possession.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.065
How much is this broken thingy worth?

10:38.190 --> 10:39.859
A lot.

10:41.068 --> 10:43.154
I'll keep it as a gift.

10:43.905 --> 10:45.823
But I don't believe you.

10:50.078 --> 10:53.081
He's one of us. Still alive.

10:53.456 --> 10:56.001
We were ambushed...

11:07.554 --> 11:08.764
Anybody home?

11:17.523 --> 11:19.191
Anybody home?

11:30.995 --> 11:34.416
Somebody, bring me meatloaf and liquor!

11:35.250 --> 11:36.126
Hey.

11:36.418 --> 11:39.379
A big shot like you,
what would you say now?

11:39.504 --> 11:42.174
"Absurd!
Take him outside for beheading."

11:54.979 --> 11:57.189
<i>Nothing to eat in here.</i>

12:31.767 --> 12:34.019
General, spare me.

12:36.230 --> 12:38.274
Liang's archer and infantry unit;
2,000 men in total.

12:38.441 --> 12:40.526
Ambushed our 1,000-strong elite unit.

12:40.693 --> 12:42.570
Both sides were totally wiped out.

12:42.820 --> 12:44.864
This is the sword I gave him.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.575
But where is he now?

12:47.992 --> 12:49.577
I believe we will find him.

12:50.578 --> 12:52.247
Wu,

12:54.708 --> 12:58.462
only if he's still among the living.

13:02.007 --> 13:04.051
War is everywhere now,

13:04.927 --> 13:07.596
where else you can go?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.432
General, have you heard of Shen Shu?

13:10.641 --> 13:13.394
The one in Mt. Phoenix?
A fortunate-telling tree.

13:15.396 --> 13:17.148
Is he your captive?

13:17.898 --> 13:20.026
He's my good luck.

13:20.943 --> 13:23.362
Hang in there.
We're almost there.

13:23.571 --> 13:25.448
How far?

13:25.615 --> 13:27.116
2 days.

13:32.914 --> 13:33.873
Small potato.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.250
Don't make me do this.

13:37.085 --> 13:38.336
Don't.

13:41.757 --> 13:43.842
Don't push your luck.

13:46.261 --> 13:47.846
Give me liquor.

13:48.180 --> 13:50.432
- No can do.
- Liquor.

13:59.358 --> 14:01.152
You've fought many battles, haven't you?

14:01.360 --> 14:05.114
Many. You can say
I'm a big time warrior.

14:05.323 --> 14:07.533
Untie me.

14:08.826 --> 14:10.662
Then you must have killed a lot.

14:10.829 --> 14:11.913
Just too many.

14:12.122 --> 14:15.542
Fought against 8 men at a time.
Like yesterday.

14:22.049 --> 14:24.092
General, would you take me too?

14:24.343 --> 14:26.136
I'd like to become your captive.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.225
Okay.

14:31.767 --> 14:34.270
I know some musical.

14:34.478 --> 14:37.857
General, keep drinking.
I'll entertain you.

14:43.571 --> 14:49.035
- If he turns out to be alive, what then?
- Keep in mind that he's already dead.

15:41.506 --> 15:43.383
Why?

15:44.927 --> 15:48.597
General, you've killed so many.

15:49.014 --> 15:51.225
I'm not a General.

15:54.228 --> 15:57.356
My family were killed by yours.

15:57.982 --> 16:00.151
And I live to sing against my will.

16:00.276 --> 16:01.861
I'm supposed to give you a good time

16:02.028 --> 16:04.113
and serve you, General.

16:07.116 --> 16:10.078
I didn't take pleasure in
drinking with you.

17:05.636 --> 17:07.762
Hey, no more fight.

17:47.095 --> 17:51.350
Hey! Open the gate. I'm a soldier.

17:51.475 --> 17:53.811
I have taken a Wei's General...

18:10.036 --> 18:11.830
Stop.

18:16.334 --> 18:17.794
Whose this head?

18:18.044 --> 18:20.172
A General of Wei.

18:26.261 --> 18:28.639
That's him. I'm sure.

18:28.722 --> 18:31.308
That's a head of Wei's General.

18:31.433 --> 18:34.019
Reward him.

18:34.311 --> 18:35.896
Just a sec.

18:36.397 --> 18:37.815
Who killed him?

18:37.898 --> 18:38.983
I did.

18:39.066 --> 18:41.194
You? Really?

18:42.111 --> 18:45.281
He must be an AWOL.
Cut off a dead man's head.

18:46.991 --> 18:48.451
Behead him.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.915
That's not true!

19:24.947 --> 19:27.075
Where's the horse?

19:47.221 --> 19:49.682
You gonna have to kill me
if you don't let me go.

19:49.765 --> 19:52.268
Or I'll kill you in a heart beat.

19:52.726 --> 19:54.353
Kill, kill, kill.

19:54.520 --> 19:55.855
I grow farms.

19:56.021 --> 19:58.774
I don't kill and I don't want to kill.

19:58.899 --> 20:00.860
You're getting me mad.

20:01.652 --> 20:03.029
I'm not gonna kill you.

20:03.154 --> 20:06.282
Can't believe I just got
fooled by some woman.

20:06.574 --> 20:09.786
I gave her food to eat,
and she gave me pills to swallow.

20:10.453 --> 20:14.207
You deceived her first,
so it sounds fair.

20:14.791 --> 20:17.127
She should have hit you instead.

20:17.419 --> 20:19.087
Stupid helmet.

20:22.257 --> 20:24.760
What did she say to you last night?

20:27.346 --> 20:29.473
You small potato.

20:36.313 --> 20:38.524
Who's stronger, me or him?

20:38.691 --> 20:39.775
He's a natural.

20:39.901 --> 20:42.487
- So I'm nowhere to compete with him?
- You're too soft and he got the heart.

20:42.653 --> 20:44.447
To become the King,

20:47.116 --> 20:49.202
you must learn from him.

20:49.494 --> 20:52.205
I'll take a unit and head for Liang's.
Why don't you go back...

20:52.330 --> 20:54.833
I won't go back until I see him.

20:55.500 --> 20:56.793
You know what,

20:56.877 --> 20:59.087
I've been looking forward to

20:59.296 --> 21:02.966
life of peace and farms to grow
for 20 years.

21:33.748 --> 21:37.335
The wagon is not here.
The rope was cut off.

21:47.429 --> 21:48.555
Hey.

21:52.142 --> 21:54.520
Hey. Hey?

22:08.076 --> 22:11.830
Stop playing dead.
I'm too smart for that.

22:39.567 --> 22:41.360
We better stay away
from the main road.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.154
Let's take a detour.

22:43.279 --> 22:47.492
Like this track.
Just don't lose the map.

22:51.579 --> 22:53.999
Strong liquor. Must be Liang's.

22:56.209 --> 23:01.965
<i>One small track
leads home.</i>

23:10.224 --> 23:12.017
What now?

23:14.186 --> 23:18.899
Like my dad said, step in shit.
Something good awaits me.

23:19.358 --> 23:20.735
It's an ambush.

23:20.985 --> 23:23.154
Yeah, right.

23:28.451 --> 23:31.579
What's loaded on that wagon?

23:31.746 --> 23:34.207
- Nothing particular.
- Rip him.

23:35.375 --> 23:37.502
Rip him off!

23:40.964 --> 23:43.258
- Wait, wait...
- Who are you?

23:43.550 --> 23:45.677
A General.

23:47.346 --> 23:49.515
Says you.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.227
Beat him.

23:53.435 --> 23:55.396
Beat him down.

23:55.563 --> 23:57.690
Stop!

24:01.819 --> 24:03.362
Stop! Stop!

24:04.989 --> 24:06.032
Sorry.

24:09.828 --> 24:11.246
Please... stop.

24:11.496 --> 24:14.165
Take whatever you want,
just let us go.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.419
What possibly do you have,
besides this piece of junk?

24:17.544 --> 24:18.420
I want revenge!

24:18.628 --> 24:20.297
Shut your mouth!

24:21.131 --> 24:23.425
Who's this guy?

24:24.092 --> 24:25.469
He?

24:25.844 --> 24:27.429
He... he's my son.

24:27.679 --> 24:28.722
No! I'm not his son...

24:28.972 --> 24:30.265
You little prick!

24:33.060 --> 24:35.729
He's crazy. He thinks he's going to war.
I'm taking him back to grow farms.

24:35.938 --> 24:37.857
Grow farms? There's nothing left
to grow because of the wars.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.067
- Revenge!
- Get lost!

24:40.192 --> 24:43.237
I'm in charge here.
I say we take the wagon.

24:43.446 --> 24:45.281
Unfaithful prick!

24:47.867 --> 24:50.870
You got a death wish?
This helmet will get you killed.

24:50.870 --> 24:53.999
- How about this?
- This? Will you ever learn?

24:54.082 --> 24:56.167
Let's go!

25:06.428 --> 25:07.679
Bang!

25:12.393 --> 25:14.019
Bunch of fools.

25:14.895 --> 25:17.773
They had no idea you're the MVP
"Most Valuable Package" here.

25:20.234 --> 25:22.153
Your son?

25:22.445 --> 25:23.738
I'm gonna treat you good!

25:23.988 --> 25:29.536
So tie me up and
take me back to your farms!

25:44.301 --> 25:47.262
Don't move. Don't breathe.

26:24.217 --> 26:26.053
You were trying to
strangle me to death?

26:28.013 --> 26:30.099
If it wasn't me...

26:43.738 --> 26:46.407
Prick!

27:01.423 --> 27:03.342
It's not Dim Mak.

27:03.675 --> 27:07.346
My dad was right.
I stepped in shit.

27:09.973 --> 27:11.392
Pretty good.

27:16.439 --> 27:18.399
Don't hurt us. I'm begging you!

27:30.328 --> 27:32.414
Hold it there.

27:40.046 --> 27:43.926
I could kill him,
or I could spare him.

27:44.134 --> 27:46.094
I just have the power.

27:49.598 --> 27:53.435
1 acre for growing beans.
1 acre for melons.

27:54.186 --> 27:58.274
How about 2 acres for beans,
2 acres for white grains?

27:58.649 --> 28:01.611
No! 3 acres for beans.

28:12.372 --> 28:13.999
Tell me,

28:14.582 --> 28:17.836
what I should do with
5 acres of farmland?

28:18.003 --> 28:19.379
I can offer you a thousand acres.

28:19.546 --> 28:20.922
That's too much.

28:21.131 --> 28:24.051
I couldn't handle that much.

28:25.886 --> 28:29.890
White grain or bean,
what to grow?

28:30.057 --> 28:33.519
I'd say rice. I love rice.

28:34.311 --> 28:38.024
White grain and rice are
the same thing, fool!

28:39.525 --> 28:41.110
You tired?

28:41.485 --> 28:43.905
Feeling comfy, right?

28:55.792 --> 28:57.252
Now I'm relieved.

28:57.752 --> 29:01.381
5 acres, I'd be working
my butt off.

29:01.465 --> 29:03.759
Right, I'll need some buffalo.

29:04.134 --> 29:07.346
One male, one female.

29:07.679 --> 29:10.724
The male will work in the farms.
The female will give milk.

29:10.808 --> 29:13.310
I'm dying to know how you're gonna
drag me all the way to Liang's.

29:13.435 --> 29:14.728
Wait, I can't milk a cow.

29:16.272 --> 29:19.066
So I'll need a wife who can do that.

29:22.445 --> 29:24.322
My eldest brother was a great warrior.

29:24.989 --> 29:26.324
He fought till death.

29:27.575 --> 29:30.745
My second brother was a honest person.

29:30.912 --> 29:32.997
He died on the battlefield as well.

29:34.624 --> 29:38.712
I'm the last seed of the family.

29:39.296 --> 29:42.466
General, do you have any siblings?

29:43.842 --> 29:45.719
Wish I hadn't.

29:58.649 --> 30:00.151
Why are you taking me here?

30:01.903 --> 30:03.654
I couldn't find 'em.

30:03.821 --> 30:07.075
The Mt. Phoenix is huge!
There's a lot of grounds to cover...

30:07.158 --> 30:08.701
Was he being tied up?

30:08.826 --> 30:12.872
Yes, his dad tied him up.
Said he's crazy or something...

30:13.081 --> 30:16.710
They both appeared to be crazy...

30:17.669 --> 30:18.920
Can I go back now?

30:39.609 --> 30:42.028
Revenge...

30:52.622 --> 30:57.669
They want to take you back from me?
It's not gonna be easy.

30:58.795 --> 31:00.464
I've been in battles for years,

31:01.089 --> 31:04.718
never seen an
elegant arrow like this one.

31:05.677 --> 31:09.014
I've seen this.
It's someone not friendly.

31:11.183 --> 31:15.020
People like you just asking this
for yourself.

31:15.354 --> 31:19.150
You know, they have you
and you'll die.

31:19.734 --> 31:22.278
I have you and you'll live.

31:22.528 --> 31:24.197
You are right.

31:24.614 --> 31:27.241
I don't want to die in vain.

31:28.284 --> 31:29.410
I'll come with you.

31:33.790 --> 31:35.667
Turns out General is afraid of death.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.752
If I die, I'll die with dignity.

31:50.099 --> 31:52.184
This way, or that way?

31:52.309 --> 31:55.646
Even if we make it to Liang's,
I could make a truce

31:55.813 --> 31:57.606
with one condition: your execution.

31:57.773 --> 32:00.192
Don't fool me.
Nobody fools me.

32:00.359 --> 32:02.737
Except that woman who drugged you.

32:02.904 --> 32:04.822
You have lots of women?

32:05.531 --> 32:09.827
Let's talk about you.
What type of women you like?

32:10.453 --> 32:12.080
We have the lustful,

32:13.331 --> 32:15.875
and the educated.

32:16.334 --> 32:18.170
I like the honest ones.

32:19.337 --> 32:22.799
But I'd probably take the educated.
She could teach me how to read.

32:31.809 --> 32:34.061
You don't have a woman, right?

32:36.814 --> 32:38.524
That woman, what did she say to you?

32:38.816 --> 32:42.403
I'll tell you, if you can make it
back to Liang's.

32:42.612 --> 32:44.238
You guys, go down there.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.699
Back to where we came.
Keep a lookout.

33:00.338 --> 33:01.923
Who is that?

33:02.924 --> 33:06.637
The Others.
They're bound to their own rules.

33:07.554 --> 33:09.181
Go make your acquaintance.

33:09.348 --> 33:10.557
They don't speak our language.

33:10.599 --> 33:12.851
They are passionate people.
Good fighters too.

33:13.269 --> 33:14.895
Better stay away from 'em.

33:21.444 --> 33:24.697
Hurry up, you don't look that tired.

33:26.157 --> 33:28.826
Birds are gathering around,

33:29.035 --> 33:32.580
but Phoenixes don't go with the flow.

33:33.123 --> 33:36.585
What chicken and ducks
are you talking about?

33:37.168 --> 33:40.964
If a phoenix lost its fur,
it'd make a chicken look elegant.

33:46.887 --> 33:48.972
You're good at throwing rocks.

33:49.682 --> 33:52.518
I used to hunt wild chicken
with rocks when I was a boy.

33:53.561 --> 33:54.436
Hey.

33:54.687 --> 33:57.273
You know why our troops camped
at the Mt. Phoenix?

33:57.440 --> 33:58.607
How would I know?

33:58.858 --> 34:02.361
Nevertheless, we had hidden there
for 2 days waiting for you.

34:03.488 --> 34:05.782
That's what I thought, a set up.

34:06.199 --> 34:07.951
If it wasn't an ambush,

34:08.117 --> 34:11.454
my elite unit would have
crushed you majorly

34:11.830 --> 34:14.581
and conquered Liang.

34:16.251 --> 34:20.005
Stop the nonsense.
We are not that weak.

34:20.839 --> 34:24.967
Anyway, an AWOL like you,
it's a shame to Liang.

34:43.612 --> 34:46.949
Now, see how elite
you say you are.

34:50.786 --> 34:53.206
General versus AWOL private?

34:55.500 --> 34:58.503
Liang versus Wei. Fair and simple.

34:58.670 --> 35:01.882
You want fair?
Keep your hands off my wound.

35:03.717 --> 35:05.469
You have your wish.

35:58.232 --> 35:59.567
You're dead.

36:01.485 --> 36:04.071
Ha! You're dead too.
We're both dead.

36:04.197 --> 36:05.448
Pervert.

36:17.127 --> 36:19.755
War is over. Wei won.

36:41.861 --> 36:45.198
Wars have been around these years.
More people have joined the military.

36:45.406 --> 36:46.991
He kills him, and he gets killed by him.

36:47.158 --> 36:49.327
What's the attraction?

36:50.620 --> 36:53.498
Liang wins. Liang wins.

36:54.749 --> 36:56.877
You call this fair?

36:57.210 --> 36:59.838
It's war.
No such thing as being fair.

37:11.100 --> 37:15.020
We'll soon have meat to eat.
Now, have some appetizer.

37:23.196 --> 37:24.655
Lost your appetite?

37:26.491 --> 37:28.034
Fine by me.

37:34.666 --> 37:38.879
General, what do you eat when
there is no war to go to?

37:41.006 --> 37:43.967
Meat and seafood.

37:44.760 --> 37:47.888
Any good food you can
possibly think of.

37:48.430 --> 37:50.683
Now I get it.
You people constantly go to war

37:50.808 --> 37:52.893
just because of digestion problems.

37:55.729 --> 37:58.024
Didn't you say you can't read?

38:00.776 --> 38:04.781
My dad taught me these 2 words.
They are the easiest to write.

38:07.992 --> 38:11.704
These 2 words...
are not easy at all.

38:12.455 --> 38:14.040
Why don't you go to Wei with me.

38:14.958 --> 38:16.668
I can offer you a high position.

38:16.793 --> 38:18.044
I forgot to tell you one thing.

38:18.253 --> 38:21.923
General alive, the rewards will be farmland
and money. No more serving in military.

38:22.174 --> 38:24.968
There will be no more killing for me.
Just me and the farms.

38:25.093 --> 38:27.596
When there's a war, there's a winner.

38:28.222 --> 38:32.059
A winner of unification of China.
Only that will put an end to wars.

38:32.351 --> 38:35.396
Only that will give you small potato
a normal life.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.522
You know what,

38:36.814 --> 38:38.607
we could have
lived our normal life,

38:38.899 --> 38:40.943
if you had just left us alone!

38:44.989 --> 38:46.282
You really don't want a bite?

38:46.366 --> 38:49.827
Frankly, I'm a bit hungry.

39:22.028 --> 39:24.322
Here comes our meat!

39:24.697 --> 39:26.532
Wonderful meat.

39:31.287 --> 39:33.915
Hey! I'll get you firewood.

39:35.000 --> 39:37.460
You have babies. Can't eat you.

39:38.211 --> 39:39.838
My dad said...

39:45.010 --> 39:46.720
Let's go. Let's go!

39:46.845 --> 39:48.680
Someone is coming. Let's go!

39:48.806 --> 39:51.600
What's the panic?
He's alone.

40:16.626 --> 40:18.128
It's our guy.

40:22.215 --> 40:24.843
Hey, bro...

40:30.224 --> 40:31.850
Bastard!

40:54.582 --> 40:57.669
<i>You. Go that way.</i>

41:17.857 --> 41:20.484
<i>A Liang-made sword.</i>

41:45.177 --> 41:46.929
On your Knees.

41:47.679 --> 41:50.766
I'm a Liang's soldier.
I only knee to Liang's superiors.

41:55.229 --> 41:58.107
- What now?
- You are a scout from Liang's.

41:58.190 --> 41:59.191
Yes.

41:59.233 --> 42:00.902
- What about you?
- I'm a scout too.

42:01.110 --> 42:01.944
What are you scouting for?

42:02.153 --> 42:03.529
I'm going to the battlefield
at Mt. Phoenix. No...

42:03.529 --> 42:05.323
No survivors found.

42:05.448 --> 42:06.949
Why taking small track?

42:07.033 --> 42:11.496
- Your convoy is taking the main road...
- Track is faster... pretty fast.

42:11.788 --> 42:14.499
- I don't know him.
- What?

42:14.833 --> 42:17.252
He's got lightheaded
after falling off from a horse.

42:17.544 --> 42:19.421
No... Yes, I fell...

42:19.588 --> 42:22.799
- Either way I just don't know you.
- What?

42:22.924 --> 42:25.469
You don't kill scouts.
That's against the tready among the states.

42:25.510 --> 42:28.055
- Is this your sword?
- Yes.

42:28.263 --> 42:30.265
Why you're carrying
a General type sword?

42:30.432 --> 42:33.435
- I borrowed it...
- You're not a scout.

42:36.021 --> 42:38.649
- No, I'm not.
- Where is the Wei's General?

42:38.774 --> 42:39.984
I don't know.

42:40.192 --> 42:42.153
Don't you lie to me!

42:42.653 --> 42:44.781
I know, I know.

42:44.947 --> 42:46.991
I've got your General.

42:47.116 --> 42:48.743
You got balls.

42:51.204 --> 42:53.206
- I got no balls!
- Where is he?

42:53.415 --> 42:55.292
- He's fled.
- You're no use to us then.

42:55.458 --> 42:57.252
No. No. I-I hid him.

42:57.419 --> 42:58.795
Take us to him.

42:58.962 --> 43:01.256
- He really is gone.
- Are you messing with me?

43:06.094 --> 43:09.431
Back off! You all back off!

43:09.598 --> 43:11.350
Back off!

43:22.653 --> 43:23.613
Stay back!

43:23.696 --> 43:27.367
- If I die, you won't get anything.
- What do you want?

43:28.952 --> 43:30.411
Rewards.

43:31.079 --> 43:34.582
- I can give you that.
- Shame on you.

43:39.296 --> 43:42.466
One of you is useless to me.

44:03.863 --> 44:06.032
What now?

44:09.577 --> 44:12.497
Mount on! Get him!

44:44.655 --> 44:46.199
Defense!

45:13.602 --> 45:16.272
Pardon me.

45:17.565 --> 45:19.358
Wu.

45:22.320 --> 45:23.821
Stand down.

45:26.658 --> 45:28.493
Let them through.

45:57.690 --> 46:00.693
He's still alive, isn't he?

46:40.985 --> 46:42.320
Pretty good.

46:42.695 --> 46:45.698
Just a General, not a big deal.

46:46.658 --> 46:49.869
Maybe I'd capture their King later.

46:52.163 --> 46:54.332
Am I really a shame to Liang?

46:55.625 --> 46:57.752
Am I?

47:10.099 --> 47:11.684
Come on.

47:12.726 --> 47:16.313
Come get me!

47:19.817 --> 47:22.403
I'm not dead yet.

47:22.695 --> 47:24.989
<i>Didn't expect that, right?</i>

47:25.448 --> 47:29.744
<i>Because of your conspiracy,
1,000 brave men got killed.</i>

47:30.370 --> 47:33.998
<i>They'll haunt you
for the rest of your life!</i>

47:35.041 --> 47:37.043
And you.

47:37.419 --> 47:40.130
A pity man.

47:40.630 --> 47:43.842
<i>A dishonorable AWOL.</i>

47:44.384 --> 47:46.845
One main road leads home

47:47.054 --> 47:50.182
empty-handed!

48:03.362 --> 48:05.698
Where you come from?

48:06.991 --> 48:09.160
Where's your home?

48:09.410 --> 48:11.371
<i>When I fulfill the conquest</i>

48:11.538 --> 48:14.791
<i>I'll start building my big boat.</i>

48:15.208 --> 48:18.670
Yeah. I'm gonna sail off
on the night of the full moon

48:19.045 --> 48:21.048
and travel the whole world.

48:21.423 --> 48:22.966
My father said,

48:23.550 --> 48:27.429
paint a dragon on the big boat,
and it'll attract a phoenix.

48:27.679 --> 48:30.474
Prince, the day you are crowned,
you'll get anything you want.

48:30.641 --> 48:34.854
To become a King, me and him
we'd never be the same again.

48:35.020 --> 48:37.148
Take some rest, Prince.

48:39.150 --> 48:42.904
My dad said, a sparrow could
one day become a phoenix.

48:44.238 --> 48:45.865
Pretty good.

49:32.414 --> 49:34.082
Hey!

49:36.251 --> 49:37.586
Why did you trick me?

49:37.794 --> 49:39.212
And I've also hit you.

49:39.421 --> 49:41.590
So kill me, General.

49:42.007 --> 49:44.009
I'm not a General.
I'm a private.

49:44.259 --> 49:47.304
What's the difference?
You just kill.

49:49.556 --> 49:51.892
Hey, you're lost, right?

49:52.059 --> 49:55.855
You really think that when you get to
Shen Shu, everything will be all right?

49:59.650 --> 50:01.444
I'm a small potato.

50:04.363 --> 50:06.157
Wait...

50:06.949 --> 50:08.660
this map I have here,

50:09.202 --> 50:12.414
will get you to Shen Shu.

50:14.290 --> 50:17.544
You'll get a lot of grounds to cover.
Take this horse with you.

50:23.759 --> 50:25.510
I give this back to you.

50:47.492 --> 50:49.953
You hungry? Me too.

50:50.995 --> 50:52.705
Need to find something to eat.

51:15.479 --> 51:19.358
<i>At the bottom of the mountain.
Soils are rich.</i>

51:19.650 --> 51:22.945
<i>5 acres of farmland</i>

51:24.489 --> 51:28.743
<i>5 acres of fine land</i>

51:29.577 --> 51:32.914
<i>What to grow?</i>

51:32.997 --> 51:34.249
<i>- You're wrong.
- You're wrong.</i>

51:34.457 --> 51:36.042
Stop arguing.

51:36.376 --> 51:41.465
If you want to be a successful diplomat,
you still need one more thing.

51:41.590 --> 51:42.632
What's that?

51:42.758 --> 51:43.800
Patience.

51:44.051 --> 51:47.012
Mister, please tell me which way is Wei.

51:47.346 --> 51:52.309
- That way.
- No, that way.

51:52.726 --> 51:56.272
<i>Wei has geographical advantages,
with Liang acting like a front shield,</i>

51:56.439 --> 51:58.983
<i>and Chu like a shield on the back.</i>

52:01.319 --> 52:03.738
<i>You can run, but you can't hide.</i>

52:14.582 --> 52:16.710
Yeah!

52:35.271 --> 52:36.772
There.

52:42.278 --> 52:43.905
This is your new home now.

52:44.947 --> 52:46.658
I'm going home too.

52:51.162 --> 52:53.248
You live a good life.

52:57.252 --> 52:59.087
Pretty good.

54:45.698 --> 54:48.242
<i>One main road</i>

54:49.244 --> 54:52.080
<i>leads home</i>

54:52.747 --> 54:57.335
<i>My home is right at
the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

54:58.378 --> 55:00.964
<i>Soils are rich there...</i>

55:04.217 --> 55:05.552
Pretty good.

55:08.055 --> 55:09.556
Pretty good.

55:18.149 --> 55:19.734
Easy, easy.

55:22.904 --> 55:25.198
I should have killed you in that inn.

55:25.448 --> 55:28.242
I should have let you
be the black bear's lunch.

55:29.911 --> 55:32.497
Don't get too tight, you catch my drift?

55:33.415 --> 55:34.708
They're taking us to a tomb.

55:35.041 --> 55:36.126
Tomb?

55:36.209 --> 55:39.171
- Get us buried in mass grave.
- Buried?

55:51.183 --> 55:53.227
How far is Liang from here?

55:53.352 --> 55:55.980
1 day if you take the river.

55:56.313 --> 55:57.898
What village you come from?

55:58.149 --> 55:59.525
Three Legs Cave.

55:59.650 --> 56:02.403
Looks like your plan isn't going well.

56:03.446 --> 56:05.948
We'll see. You're still my captive.

56:06.240 --> 56:08.910
Hey, I'm not your captive!

56:09.035 --> 56:11.162
I'm his captive!

57:44.551 --> 57:47.012
Trade him with a horse.

57:54.979 --> 57:57.148
Prince, look out!

58:17.168 --> 58:18.879
Line up.

58:20.088 --> 58:21.965
Defense!

58:52.038 --> 58:55.333
- How to take this thing off?
- I'm about to ask you the same question.

59:14.478 --> 59:15.896
Wu!

01:00:01.527 --> 01:00:03.738
- I have an idea.
- Just say it.

01:00:03.905 --> 01:00:06.532
Remember, we're in the same boat.

01:00:07.450 --> 01:00:09.494
Yes, like my dad said,

01:00:09.702 --> 01:00:12.872
Whether it's a an eagle or a chicken,
they are just meat once placed in a hotpot.

01:00:13.039 --> 01:00:14.124
Figured.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:54.833
Need help.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:57.002
Not a perfect plan...

01:01:00.756 --> 01:01:02.466
but still a good idea.

01:01:10.474 --> 01:01:12.059
Come on.

01:01:12.226 --> 01:01:15.020
Help me, help me...

01:01:38.378 --> 01:01:41.548
- Wu.
- Yes.

01:01:44.051 --> 01:01:48.764
- You finally fight me with a real sword.
- Sorry, you're no longer my master now.

01:02:05.865 --> 01:02:09.327
What a pity,
you're my best student ever.

01:02:21.548 --> 01:02:23.675
Get on it.

01:02:25.636 --> 01:02:27.846
Buffalo, faster.

01:03:03.091 --> 01:03:05.260
Prince, make your way out.

01:03:58.858 --> 01:04:02.445
- This way.
- That way.

01:04:04.071 --> 01:04:07.700
Hey, you know what,
I didn't want to save you.

01:04:07.992 --> 01:04:11.079
This buffalo just lost his temper.

01:04:13.081 --> 01:04:17.085
Was this buffalo too power
or the wall was too weak?

01:04:17.210 --> 01:04:19.796
Not matter what, thank you.

01:04:20.130 --> 01:04:22.174
Pretty good. Pretty good.

01:04:23.342 --> 01:04:25.427
What's with your waist belt?

01:04:26.386 --> 01:04:27.638
My secret.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:31.475
Before we go separate ways,
I'll have a secret to tell.

01:04:31.892 --> 01:04:33.936
You want to know why those people
wanted to capture me?

01:04:34.103 --> 01:04:35.437
No, I don't want to know.

01:04:35.563 --> 01:04:37.982
People like you are so complicated.

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:41.027
Since the day we met,
everything has become complicated.

01:04:42.278 --> 01:04:44.197
Small potato!

01:04:44.447 --> 01:04:45.698
You're still my POW.

01:04:45.907 --> 01:04:47.575
Can't let you walk out on me!

01:04:50.245 --> 01:04:52.914
- You've delayed my business.
- You're my business.

01:04:56.835 --> 01:04:58.795
Wei's General
I know, I'm your farmland.

01:04:58.962 --> 01:05:01.965
Yes, 5 acres of it.

01:05:02.257 --> 01:05:04.134
And the reward money.

01:05:04.301 --> 01:05:06.345
Yes, a pocketful of it.

01:05:09.223 --> 01:05:10.599
- Stop!
- Why?

01:05:10.724 --> 01:05:13.727
- I'm ordering you!
- You can't trick me!

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:15.813
Thanks for the warning...

01:05:37.335 --> 01:05:39.296
This can't hold any longer.

01:05:39.921 --> 01:05:42.341
- Get off of my back.
- Not a chance.

01:05:42.591 --> 01:05:46.220
- I'll grab you after you let go of me.
- You think I'd buy that?

01:05:46.470 --> 01:05:48.013
Let's find out.

01:06:04.906 --> 01:06:06.407
Wu.

01:06:08.159 --> 01:06:09.661
Prince.

01:06:11.871 --> 01:06:13.456
Why?

01:06:14.124 --> 01:06:19.463
He's still alive. Is that fate?

01:06:19.629 --> 01:06:21.298
Prince, let's head back to Wei.

01:06:21.590 --> 01:06:24.885
No! You don't know how I feel.

01:06:46.115 --> 01:06:49.369
You really are some piece of work.

01:06:52.288 --> 01:06:55.709
Go ahead. Tie me up.

01:06:56.918 --> 01:06:58.628
Just take a look around.

01:07:00.714 --> 01:07:03.842
Take a look around at this hell hole!

01:07:14.186 --> 01:07:15.521
Where are we?

01:07:27.867 --> 01:07:31.746
Save your breath.
We're gonna die down here.

01:07:40.088 --> 01:07:43.216
<i>One main road</i>

01:07:43.842 --> 01:07:46.678
<i>leads home</i>

01:07:47.721 --> 01:07:50.516
<i>My home is right at</i>

01:07:50.849 --> 01:07:53.811
<i>the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

01:07:55.396 --> 01:07:58.274
<i>Soils are rich there</i>

01:07:58.482 --> 01:08:00.651
You're losing it.

01:08:00.985 --> 01:08:03.362
Pretty good. My dad said,

01:08:03.446 --> 01:08:07.033
as long as you still alive,
it's pretty good.

01:08:07.241 --> 01:08:08.618
Must I become the King?

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:12.205
You'll be a good King.
It's a good thing for Wei.

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:15.959
Are you trying to convince me
to kill him without a blink of an eye?

01:08:16.084 --> 01:08:19.629
We've gone this far,
this is the only way out.

01:08:19.754 --> 01:08:22.758
Okay, how can he die

01:08:24.468 --> 01:08:26.470
with dignity?

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.098
What are you thinking?

01:08:30.683 --> 01:08:32.100
Rapeseed flower.

01:08:34.854 --> 01:08:36.814
I'm thinking about growing rapeseed.

01:08:36.981 --> 01:08:38.024
Why?

01:08:38.232 --> 01:08:39.149
Why what?

01:08:39.442 --> 01:08:42.569
Why am I being stuck
in a place like this?

01:08:42.987 --> 01:08:46.491
I should be the one who brings
all the Dukes to their knees.

01:08:46.783 --> 01:08:49.118
And then have a huge tomb
made for me.

01:08:49.285 --> 01:08:52.872
Have my own treasure
buried with me.

01:08:53.747 --> 01:08:56.417
Now they can't even
find my corpse.

01:08:57.042 --> 01:09:02.256
Yeah, the rest of reward money
would go to my new pharmacy store.

01:09:02.424 --> 01:09:05.801
To be honest, your drugs worked.

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:09.890
I'm appointing you as
The Minister for Health.

01:09:14.603 --> 01:09:19.358
You know what, if it wasn't the wars,
we could have been buddies.

01:09:20.192 --> 01:09:21.569
Perhaps.

01:09:23.237 --> 01:09:25.238
If you make it out alive,

01:09:25.782 --> 01:09:29.118
will you promise me one thing?

01:09:29.368 --> 01:09:30.662
Shoot.

01:09:32.788 --> 01:09:36.084
Never invade my nation, Liang.

01:09:44.593 --> 01:09:48.263
I give you 10 years of truce.

01:09:48.764 --> 01:09:52.977
Sounds tricky.
You have an agreement.

01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:58.190
And you need to promise me one thing.

01:09:58.232 --> 01:09:59.233
Shoot.

01:09:59.275 --> 01:10:01.235
If you ever make it out alive,

01:10:02.195 --> 01:10:03.988
you must tell them that

01:10:06.366 --> 01:10:07.742
I died fighting.

01:10:08.451 --> 01:10:11.412
I died fighting for my people.

01:10:12.247 --> 01:10:14.708
I've done nothing disgraceful
to Wei.

01:10:16.167 --> 01:10:21.882
We all bite the dust,
but not our flag.

01:10:24.301 --> 01:10:26.178
Don't lie to me,

01:10:27.095 --> 01:10:29.139
you small potato.

01:10:30.057 --> 01:10:32.268
Being a small potato...

01:10:32.726 --> 01:10:35.354
sounds pretty good.

01:12:17.168 --> 01:12:19.004
Hey! Hey!

01:12:21.339 --> 01:12:22.799
Wake up.

01:12:42.403 --> 01:12:46.574
Dad, I'm alive!

01:12:47.575 --> 01:12:49.744
Thanks Heaven!

01:12:50.036 --> 01:12:52.455
Thanks Heaven!

01:12:53.998 --> 01:12:56.835
You know what, this is
Three Legs Cave.

01:12:56.918 --> 01:12:59.421
There is a fisherman's village nearby.
I'll go get a boat.

01:12:59.713 --> 01:13:01.047
It'll take half a day to get there.

01:13:01.173 --> 01:13:02.716
To where?

01:13:02.841 --> 01:13:05.677
To Liang, where else could it be?

01:13:06.386 --> 01:13:11.517
<i>Don't think about running away.
You can't survive an hour without me.</i>

01:13:19.191 --> 01:13:20.568
Quick, quick!

01:13:21.444 --> 01:13:22.528
Go hide!

01:13:22.737 --> 01:13:23.905
Hide from what?

01:13:24.113 --> 01:13:27.659
Just hide.

01:13:27.909 --> 01:13:29.619
Help me up.

01:13:37.419 --> 01:13:38.670
Little brother.

01:13:39.629 --> 01:13:41.381
Little brother?

01:13:42.841 --> 01:13:44.468
He's your brother?

01:13:44.635 --> 01:13:47.221
You've been chasing me for days.
Don't you get tired?

01:13:47.429 --> 01:13:48.347
Prince.

01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:49.598
Prince?

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:51.392
Why the mourning bandana?

01:13:51.684 --> 01:13:53.185
It's for our father.

01:13:53.394 --> 01:13:56.439
He was very sick when
I left for battles. It's you.

01:13:56.605 --> 01:14:00.192
It's fate. You just cared about
waging wars to please the old man.

01:14:00.318 --> 01:14:03.446
If I hadn't upset him by making
peace arrangement with Liang,

01:14:03.571 --> 01:14:05.073
I would have been the Prince.

01:14:05.198 --> 01:14:07.867
You set the ambush to make sure
I'd get killed.

01:14:08.534 --> 01:14:10.119
Something going on between you two

01:14:10.286 --> 01:14:12.205
and we Liang paid with 2,000 lives.

01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:13.581
You're not authorized to talk to me.

01:14:13.790 --> 01:14:15.792
You're not authorized to talk to me.

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.462
- Leave him out of this.
- But he's the enemy.

01:14:19.546 --> 01:14:21.506
He wants me to live,
but you wants me to die.

01:14:21.631 --> 01:14:26.637
Come on. Use that crossbow I gave you
and claim the throne of Wei.

01:14:33.477 --> 01:14:35.479
You're still too soft-hearted.

01:14:38.733 --> 01:14:40.276
Your sword.

01:14:40.401 --> 01:14:43.988
If you don't kill him, he will kill you.

01:14:45.031 --> 01:14:47.033
Only one of you will become the King.

01:14:50.495 --> 01:14:53.873
That's doesn't make any sense,
why one of you brothers must die?

01:14:53.998 --> 01:14:57.294
- It's none of your business.
- You guys are complicating things.

01:14:57.294 --> 01:15:02.466
- I said "it's none of your business!"
- It's all because of that nosy baldhead.

01:15:04.176 --> 01:15:05.677
I'm done talking.

01:15:18.190 --> 01:15:20.985
He really looks upset.
Maybe we should go now.

01:15:27.492 --> 01:15:28.952
I'm really messed up big time.

01:15:29.244 --> 01:15:32.122
You do what you got to do, Master.

01:15:53.310 --> 01:15:55.855
Hey, can we go now?

01:17:20.735 --> 01:17:23.946
General!
Behind you!

01:17:28.618 --> 01:17:30.453
It's none of my business.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:37.043
What a pity.

01:18:22.049 --> 01:18:24.134
Not even one small rock?

01:18:50.912 --> 01:18:52.539
Don't get any closer,

01:18:52.789 --> 01:18:54.833
or you'd get blind.

01:18:57.127 --> 01:18:58.962
<i>Big brother!</i>

01:20:05.490 --> 01:20:07.575
Stop!

01:20:10.370 --> 01:20:13.498
I'm the one you should kill.

01:20:14.082 --> 01:20:16.793
I'm the one you should kill.

01:20:17.335 --> 01:20:22.340
Me and my brother,
only one will walk out here alive.

01:20:24.092 --> 01:20:28.305
You don't understand
what I'm saying, do you?

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:34.061
How about this?

01:20:34.311 --> 01:20:36.188
This is what I got to do.

01:20:36.397 --> 01:20:37.648
<i>Little brother!</i>

01:20:44.363 --> 01:20:45.615
Big brother,

01:20:46.532 --> 01:20:49.077
am I dying with dignity?

01:20:51.037 --> 01:20:55.834
Sorry about our big boat.

01:20:55.917 --> 01:20:59.379
We can never build it together.

01:21:47.429 --> 01:21:48.639
Do me a favor.

01:21:50.265 --> 01:21:51.976
Help me bury him.

01:21:57.690 --> 01:22:02.278
We must carry on, General.
We got half day.

01:22:03.154 --> 01:22:06.366
Sorry, I mean Prince.

01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:15.250
Your Wei's liquor is not strong enough.

01:22:16.668 --> 01:22:18.920
I know what you're thinking.

01:22:19.129 --> 01:22:22.174
I also know what you're thinking.

01:22:24.343 --> 01:22:27.971
- Pretty good.
- We're still alive.

01:22:30.265 --> 01:22:34.770
You two reminded me
of my own brothers.

01:22:35.104 --> 01:22:36.480
They were good soldiers.

01:22:36.730 --> 01:22:38.899
In fact,
I wanted to be a good soldier.

01:22:40.443 --> 01:22:44.447
The first time we enlisted,
we 3 brothers got no choice.

01:22:44.614 --> 01:22:46.866
The first tour lasted for 3 years.

01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:48.743
When we came back,

01:22:49.619 --> 01:22:51.788
our village had been burnt to ground.

01:22:52.705 --> 01:22:54.874
We became homeless.

01:22:55.417 --> 01:22:58.503
Before my dad died, he told us

01:22:58.753 --> 01:23:01.882
we had served our country.

01:23:02.924 --> 01:23:07.471
But when the wars will end?

01:23:08.764 --> 01:23:13.519
And he said, "kids, listen,

01:23:16.522 --> 01:23:18.983
one of you 3 brothers must live,

01:23:23.446 --> 01:23:26.407
in order to raise kids for our family."

01:23:27.700 --> 01:23:31.037
Now I'm the only one left.

01:23:35.375 --> 01:23:40.380
Having you is my biggest luck ever.

01:23:48.472 --> 01:23:53.310
I can't say the same thing about my luck.

01:24:09.202 --> 01:24:10.620
Don't ask.

01:24:11.204 --> 01:24:13.581
What she said to me the other night:

01:24:15.250 --> 01:24:17.168
"kama".

01:24:19.421 --> 01:24:21.465
What a little potato.

01:24:31.266 --> 01:24:34.395
Shen Shu, Mt. Phoenix.

01:24:39.442 --> 01:24:45.406
"Peace"

01:25:00.255 --> 01:25:01.965
"Mt. Liang"

01:25:02.090 --> 01:25:05.594
You know what,
after this turn is Liang's soil.

01:25:10.599 --> 01:25:14.270
My brother wanted to befriend
Liang, maybe he's right.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.982
If Liang's Duke spare my life, may be we could
work something out for allying each other.

01:25:18.023 --> 01:25:19.775
Maybe, maybe.

01:25:21.861 --> 01:25:23.362
Maybe it's too late.

01:25:24.322 --> 01:25:25.948
Maybe.

01:25:41.173 --> 01:25:43.717
Nothing feels like home!

01:25:47.888 --> 01:25:50.015
That's your secret belt...

01:25:58.858 --> 01:26:00.568
I was wrong about you.

01:26:01.527 --> 01:26:04.781
Never thought you could make
this journey for both of us.

01:26:05.698 --> 01:26:09.118
Now, am I your captive or enemy?

01:26:16.376 --> 01:26:18.712
Neither. Just go.

01:26:21.339 --> 01:26:24.468
Hurry. Before I change my mind.

01:26:28.472 --> 01:26:29.807
Why?

01:26:31.141 --> 01:26:32.893
You 2 brothers...

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.020
one must live.

01:26:45.782 --> 01:26:47.450
Can I count on your word?

01:26:48.076 --> 01:26:49.285
What you mean?

01:26:49.619 --> 01:26:51.371
10 years of truce!

01:26:51.621 --> 01:26:54.916
Absolutely!
You have my word!

01:26:59.171 --> 01:27:00.881
Don't forget...

01:27:01.298 --> 01:27:04.593
that medal you took from me,
it's worth a fortunate.

01:27:04.885 --> 01:27:08.347
It can get your farmland and money.

01:27:09.932 --> 01:27:11.642
I found it.

01:27:14.562 --> 01:27:17.148
I might not live long enough...

01:27:18.649 --> 01:27:22.236
Now I'm empty-handed.
Pretty good.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:27.742
<i>Run.</i>

01:27:29.118 --> 01:27:31.412
Run away now.

01:28:11.955 --> 01:28:13.623
Ask him to surrender.

01:28:15.959 --> 01:28:19.546
Liang has been destroyed.
Knee down and surrender.

01:28:21.423 --> 01:28:23.050
Liang is gone?

01:28:24.343 --> 01:28:25.677
How could that possible?

01:28:25.802 --> 01:28:29.056
Liang refused to surrender.
So we, from Qin, destroyed it.

01:28:29.139 --> 01:28:32.810
- Your units have been completely eliminated.
- On your knee. Last chance.

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.979
All units wiped out?

01:28:35.104 --> 01:28:36.730
No more Liang.

01:28:37.189 --> 01:28:38.441
"Qin"

01:28:38.524 --> 01:28:42.028
This is not happening.

01:29:01.131 --> 01:29:03.342
Liang is history.

01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:08.472
I really got nothing left now.

01:29:09.389 --> 01:29:12.518
Put the flag down.

01:29:19.108 --> 01:29:22.194
<i>One main road</i>

01:29:22.278 --> 01:29:24.322
Your units have been wiped out.

01:29:24.405 --> 01:29:26.949
That's not entirely true.

01:29:27.075 --> 01:29:28.368
Drop your sword.

01:29:28.618 --> 01:29:30.620
I'm still standing!
Give your best shot!

01:29:30.787 --> 01:29:34.416
<i>My home is right at</i>

01:29:36.543 --> 01:29:39.796
<i>the foot of Mt. Liang</i>

01:29:40.464 --> 01:29:48.514
<i>Soils are rich there
5 acres of farms</i>

01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.685
<i>5 acres of farm</i>

01:29:52.851 --> 01:29:54.353
Sorry dad,

01:29:54.854 --> 01:29:59.150
guess I'm not gonna raise
any kids now.

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:05.490
<i>One big river</i>

01:30:05.990 --> 01:30:09.452

01:30:10.828 --> 01:30:15.166
<i>My wife, my kids</i>

01:30:15.667 --> 01:30:18.795
<i>and my big house</i>

01:30:20.714 --> 01:30:25.177
<i>Chickens and ducks are fat</i>

01:30:25.802 --> 01:30:29.932
<i>Cattle is strong</i>

01:30:30.682 --> 01:30:35.187
<i>Grow some bean
white grain</i>

01:30:35.604 --> 01:30:39.859
<i>and rapeseed flower</i>

01:31:04.509 --> 01:31:09.223
I ain't a shame to Liang, am I?

01:31:10.516 --> 01:31:12.434
"Liang"

01:31:13.477 --> 01:31:19.608
SDH/translation: Arigon

01:31:19.900 --> 01:31:22.945
<i>Qin conquered Liang.</i>

01:31:23.321 --> 01:31:26.157
<i>The General has returned to Wei
and claimed the throne.</i>

01:31:26.491 --> 01:31:29.118
<i>Since then he gave up waging wars.</i>

01:31:29.494 --> 01:31:34.332
<i>When facing the invasion of Qin,
Wei's Duke complied to surrender.</i>

01:31:34.624 --> 01:31:38.044
<i>Soldiers and civilians
were left to life in peace.</i>

01:31:38.295 --> 01:31:40.964
<i>During the last few years of
the Warring States Period,</i>

01:31:41.131 --> 01:31:43.133
<i>one China was nearly shaped.</i>

01:31:43.383 --> 01:31:49.389
<i>Qin united all states of China
in 221 B.C.</i>

01:31:56.397 --> 01:32:00.526
You hungry?
You bite me!

01:32:14.207 --> 01:32:16.584
We're gonna hit the rock.
Back up the boat.

01:32:17.586 --> 01:32:22.966
- ...be your "hotpot"
- "Hot pot" is for cooking meals.

01:32:23.967 --> 01:32:26.261
- It reads "captive!"
- "Captive!"

01:33:27.075 --> 01:33:28.868
You're hitting me for real?

01:33:29.494 --> 01:33:31.496
You're doing for real?

01:33:45.761 --> 01:33:48.222
I've haven't finished my line!

01:33:50.724 --> 01:33:53.852
- I don't know what I'm saying.
- You're messing with me?

01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:00.401
I'm Wei's Pince...
I've speaken the wrong country...

01:34:19.212 --> 01:34:22.799
You could kill someone with this bun.

01:34:41.861 --> 01:34:43.321
This nose is too big.

01:34:58.461 --> 01:35:01.840
