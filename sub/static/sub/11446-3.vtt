02:41.203 --> 02:42.238
Take care of the horses!

02:56.843 --> 02:59.585
Two letters arrived for you
from Monsieur Jared.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.261
Thank you.

03:01.348 --> 03:02.713
I'll tend to them later.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.173
Naturally Master Raymond

16:52.136 --> 16:54.173
...this must stay strictly,
...between you and I.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.674
Of course, Comte...

16:56.349 --> 16:57.384
...that goes without saying.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.559
I believe you know the Comte?

17:14.992 --> 17:16.027
Yes.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.823
We are...
...acquainted.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.543
Yes, indeed.

21:26.952 --> 21:27.942
Mercy.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.113
No hands here--

21:58.192 --> 21:59.648
Is it what you thought, Madame?

22:00.945 --> 22:01.935
Yes.

22:02.029 --> 22:03.144
Exactly as I imagined.

22:08.494 --> 22:10.155
And are those the physicians?

22:10.329 --> 22:11.945
They are as close as we get.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.622
They donate their time because they are
interested in the medical arts.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.661
Monsieur Lovrien is a butcher by trade.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.995
He's our specialist with
muscles and bones.

22:20.673 --> 22:24.007
Monsieur Parnene makes trusses
at his own establishment.

22:24.802 --> 22:26.509
But when he is here,
he acts as a urinoscopist.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.389
A dog?

22:36.522 --> 22:37.853
In the hospital?

22:38.065 --> 22:39.180
It is Bouton.

22:39.692 --> 22:40.682
And that is Mother Hildegarde.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.017
Mother, this is Lady Broch Tuarach.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.154
You are Scottish then?

22:51.662 --> 22:54.324
English. My husband is a Scot.

23:09.179 --> 23:11.671
Sister,
can you give milady something to do?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.382
Bouton,
come along.

24:20.334 --> 24:21.824
Are you thirsty, Madame?

24:22.419 --> 24:23.955
Always, Madame.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.292
And always hungry as well.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.088
Yet no flesh gathers on my bones...

24:31.929 --> 24:33.795
...no matter how much I eat.

25:45.210 --> 25:46.325
Pardon me, sir.

29:59.298 --> 30:00.288
Where is my wife?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.826
Magnificent, is it not?

37:38.923 --> 37:42.211
And this beautiful
piece of art...

37:42.552 --> 37:44.759
...is available for your more
intimate inspection...

37:46.222 --> 37:47.257
...in private.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.895
You.

37:58.902 --> 37:59.937
Boy!

38:02.781 --> 38:03.862
Move away!

38:37.816 --> 38:39.557
Let me go, you dirty English bastard!

38:39.984 --> 38:40.974
Enghsh?

38:45.156 --> 38:46.146
And second...

38:46.282 --> 38:47.647
...you won't go
anywhere, lad!

41:06.965 --> 41:09.081
You have beautiful breasts, Madame.

46:41.299 --> 46:42.585
Check the mouth, Bouton.

46:45.553 --> 46:46.588
Open your mouth.

46:56.605 --> 46:57.811
Have a look elsewhere, Bouton...

46:57.982 --> 46:58.972
...but carefully.

46:59.442 --> 47:01.058
The man has a broken leg.

47:09.243 --> 47:11.575
Good boy, Bouton. There it is.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.945
This will hurt.

47:56.123 --> 47:58.285
But then you will begin
to feel much better.

48:26.570 --> 48:27.560
Yes...

48:27.738 --> 48:30.025
...she'll do perfectly!

48:36.914 --> 48:37.904
MY apologies.
