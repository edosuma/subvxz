<i>Something that you have got</i>

01:28.040 --> 01:30.759
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:33.235
<i>And it's gonna be real hot</i>

01:35.560 --> 01:37.391
Ladies, you can't go.

01:37.520 --> 01:40.956
What about Jimmy?
What about the show?

01:41.080 --> 01:44.914
Marty, you know I can talk.
Now watch me walk.

01:50.560 --> 01:53.791
Sugar, Jimmy was just being Jimmy.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.356
You know he's crazy about you.
Just crazy.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.515
Oh, really?

01:58.640 --> 02:01.791
Well, give the crazy man
a message from me.

02:01.920 --> 02:05.071
Tell him I got his number.
His phone number.

02:05.360 --> 02:06.349
Now, baby...

02:06.480 --> 02:09.870
At home, where he lives, with his wife.

02:11.240 --> 02:13.959
Come on, Joann.
We don't have to put up with this shit.

02:14.560 --> 02:15.879
Shit.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.554
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

02:20.680 --> 02:24.309
<i>I'm lookin' for something now</i>

02:24.440 --> 02:26.954
<i>I'm lookin' for something, baby</i>

02:27.080 --> 02:30.038
<i>I'm lookin' for something now</i>

02:30.840 --> 02:34.310
The unstoppable Stepp Sisters!
Let's hear it!

02:35.080 --> 02:38.197
All right now. Won't be long now, y'all.

02:38.320 --> 02:41.756
Coming your way is the wildest man
in show business, Detroit's own

02:41.880 --> 02:44.758
James "Thunder" Early
will be kicking off

02:44.880 --> 02:47.838
his national tour right here
on stage tonight.

02:47.960 --> 02:53.239
Mercy. Mercy, mercy. Ladies? Ladies?
I've got the break of your lives.

02:53.360 --> 02:57.035
The great Jimmy Early is looking
for some backup help tonight...

02:57.160 --> 03:00.835
Now I want you to turn it on
for Little Albert and the Tru-Tones!

03:00.960 --> 03:04.077
<i>Me and my baby goin' downtown</i>

03:04.200 --> 03:06.714
<i>Me and my baby gettin' down tonight</i>

03:10.960 --> 03:14.509
- I'm so sorry, Mr...
- Taylor. Curtis Taylor, Jr.

03:14.640 --> 03:17.279
Look, I know we're late, but my mama
don't like me going out on weeknights.

03:17.400 --> 03:20.153
So I had to wait for her to go to bed.
She's a grade-school teacher.

03:20.280 --> 03:21.395
Who are you?

03:22.600 --> 03:25.239
Deena Jones!
I'm one of The Dreamettes.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.277
You were supposed to go on second.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.312
I know, but my mama wouldn't
go to bed, so I couldn't go out.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.431
Hey, tough luck, kid. The show's over.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.113
Let me lay something on you
right quick, brother.

03:34.240 --> 03:35.753
Check it out, man.

03:35.880 --> 03:38.519
Look, I know you're a great man
and you're the boss with all the ladies,

03:38.640 --> 03:39.993
so I don't want you
coming up weak in here,

03:40.120 --> 03:42.554
but low-rating people, that's not
why you're in this business, right?

03:42.680 --> 03:43.669
No!

03:43.800 --> 03:47.998
That's good, so why don't we
give these girls a break tonight?

03:50.520 --> 03:52.476
Okay, I'll put you on last.

03:52.960 --> 03:55.315
- Right after Tiny Joe Dixon.
- Thank you.

03:55.440 --> 03:57.874
Excuse me, which one is Tiny?

04:03.520 --> 04:05.511
<i>We're going downtown</i>

04:05.640 --> 04:09.997
<i>Check out the sights</i>

04:14.280 --> 04:18.671
Okay, we're going to get down and dirty
with my man, Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

04:24.160 --> 04:27.152
<i>Baby, I'm takin' the long way home</i>

04:27.840 --> 04:31.992
<i>'Cause my baby don't live there no more</i>

04:32.320 --> 04:33.469
I got the music to the drummer.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.919
C.C., we're on next.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.235
- Where is Effie?
- I'm right here.

04:38.840 --> 04:41.877
God, I need to rest.
Where's our dressing room?

04:42.000 --> 04:44.275
Effie, there's no time for that.
We go on in two minutes.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.391
- What?
- Come on, let's warm up.

04:46.520 --> 04:47.475
<i>Move, move...</i>

04:59.840 --> 05:01.558
We're ruined unless
we can find new wigs.

05:01.680 --> 05:03.716
Why do we need wigs in the first place?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.917
Because we need a look.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.554
- I got it! Turn the wigs around.
- What?

05:09.680 --> 05:11.955
No, really.
Come on, turn the wigs around.

05:14.560 --> 05:18.872
Oh, Deena, it's so different.

05:20.840 --> 05:23.798
It's sophisticated looking. Come on!

05:24.920 --> 05:28.549
Frontways or backways,
store-bought hair ain't natural.

05:28.680 --> 05:30.875
And what about these dresses?

05:31.320 --> 05:35.279
I mean, this dress does nothing
for my body.

05:35.600 --> 05:37.079
- You got the same wig I got?
- Yeah.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.634
- You got the same dress I got?
- Yeah.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.318
Then shut up.

05:49.520 --> 05:50.669
Say, Miss?

05:51.840 --> 05:53.353
I think you look just great.

05:56.640 --> 05:59.632
<i>She left with all her clothes</i>

06:00.200 --> 06:02.111
<i>Her bedroom in a mess</i>

06:02.920 --> 06:08.153
<i>I don't know why she went away</i>
<i>'cause I gave her all my best</i>

06:09.480 --> 06:11.869
<i>Baby, I'm takin' the long way home</i>

06:13.240 --> 06:17.074
<i>'Cause my baby don't live there no more</i>

06:18.800 --> 06:21.872
- What's the name of your group again?
- The Dreamettes.

06:23.160 --> 06:24.593
Nice, baby.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.354
Yeah.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.797
Let's hear it for Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

06:48.920 --> 06:54.119
And now for our final act of the evening,
the courageous, the curvaceous,

06:54.240 --> 06:56.071
Creamettes!

06:56.200 --> 06:58.111
It's The Dreamettes! The Dreamettes!

06:59.160 --> 07:00.434
<i>Move, move</i>

07:00.560 --> 07:02.676
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

07:02.800 --> 07:04.119
<i>Move, move</i>

07:04.240 --> 07:06.196
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

07:06.320 --> 07:07.799
<i>You better move</i>

07:08.360 --> 07:10.032
<i>You're steppin' on my heart</i>

07:10.160 --> 07:11.479
<i>I said, move</i>

07:12.080 --> 07:13.877
<i>You're tearin' it apart</i>

07:14.000 --> 07:15.069
<i>Please move</i>

07:15.200 --> 07:17.395
<i>Oh, what am I gonna do?</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:19.112
<i>My heart</i>

07:19.240 --> 07:21.310
<i>Is breakin', breakin' up over you</i>

07:24.000 --> 07:26.468
<i>You've got such magnetic power</i>

07:26.600 --> 07:29.398
<i>That just keeps holding me down</i>

07:29.960 --> 07:32.235
<i>I feel just like a flower</i>

07:32.360 --> 07:33.429
<i>That you're keeping stuck</i>

07:33.560 --> 07:35.391
<i>in the ground, ground, ground</i>

07:35.520 --> 07:38.239
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

07:38.600 --> 07:39.635
<i>Move it, move it</i>

07:39.760 --> 07:41.159
<i>Out of my life</i>

07:41.280 --> 07:44.352
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

07:44.480 --> 07:45.435
<i>Move it, move it</i>

07:45.560 --> 07:46.879
<i>Out of my life</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:48.399
<i>Move, move</i>

07:48.520 --> 07:51.239
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

07:51.720 --> 07:54.029
<i>You are so horribly satanic</i>

07:54.160 --> 07:56.958
<i>The way you lead me around</i>

07:57.640 --> 07:59.949
<i>I feel just like the Titanic</i>

08:00.080 --> 08:02.719
<i>I'm always going down</i>

08:02.840 --> 08:04.432
<i>Move, move</i>

08:04.560 --> 08:06.551
<i>You're steppin' on my style</i>

08:06.680 --> 08:08.477
<i>You're steppin' on my style</i>
<i>Yes, you are</i>

08:08.600 --> 08:10.079
<i>I said, move, move</i>

08:12.160 --> 08:14.628
<i>I want to breathe for a while</i>

08:17.800 --> 08:19.950
<i>Hey, baby</i>

08:20.840 --> 08:22.592
<i>Get out of my life</i>

08:23.160 --> 08:25.230
<i>There's too much pain and strife</i>

08:25.360 --> 08:27.237
<i>So why don't you pack it up</i>
<i>and move it?</i>

08:27.360 --> 08:28.952
<i>Take the cat, kit and caboodle</i>

08:29.080 --> 08:30.149
<i>Take your broken-down car</i>

08:30.280 --> 08:31.349
<i>Your smelly cigar</i>

08:31.480 --> 08:33.357
<i>And just move right out of my</i>

08:33.480 --> 08:37.758
<i>Move right out of my life</i>

08:53.880 --> 08:56.474
Come on! Come on! You can do better!

08:56.600 --> 09:00.115
Let's hear it for the delectable,
defiant Dreamettes!

09:12.480 --> 09:16.155
Hey, Mister. Five dimes
say The Dreamettes don't win.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.150
You got it.
They weren't going to win anyway.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.668
Now remember,
the winner of this year's contest gets

09:23.800 --> 09:27.793
a week's paid engagement right here
at the famous Detroit Theatre.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.554
All right now.

09:31.320 --> 09:35.552
And that very lucky,
very talented star of tomorrow is

09:37.520 --> 09:39.511
Mr Tiny Joe Dixon!

09:51.600 --> 09:53.670
Does this mean
we're not going to be famous now?

09:53.800 --> 09:55.028
Well, not tonight.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.832
Come on, let's go home.

09:57.720 --> 09:58.709
Why?

09:58.840 --> 10:01.354
Because I'm tired
and I got to get up early for work.

10:01.480 --> 10:03.232
I mean, what's the point?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.518
Lorrell, how old were we
when we first started singing together?

10:06.640 --> 10:07.629
Twelve.

10:07.760 --> 10:11.196
And C.C., how many dances
you got dreamed up for us?

10:11.320 --> 10:13.754
How many songs written there
in your notebook?

10:13.880 --> 10:15.233
I don't know. Maybe a hundred.

10:16.200 --> 10:20.318
And, Effie, have you ever met anyone
who could sing as crazy as you?

10:20.520 --> 10:21.589
No.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.598
And still we get nowhere?

10:23.880 --> 10:27.111
So I'm asking you, what's the point?

10:27.560 --> 10:29.437
The point is you don't need
an amateur contest,

10:29.560 --> 10:31.039
because there's nothing
amateur about you.

10:31.160 --> 10:34.277
What you need is a break,
and I'm here to give it to you.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.637
Thirty bucks each
to sing behind Mr Jimmy Early tonight.

10:37.760 --> 10:39.034
Jimmy Early?

10:39.160 --> 10:41.230
And a guaranteed 10-week
engagement on the road

10:41.360 --> 10:44.033
starting tomorrow morning
at $400 a week.

10:44.160 --> 10:45.275
- $400?
- Yes.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.755
- You swear?
- If I'm lying, I'm dying.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.110
By the way, Mr Early said
he'd hire my Aunt Ethel

10:50.240 --> 10:51.912
to watch after you gals
while you're away from home.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.917
Mama's going to love that!

10:54.280 --> 10:55.235
Effie, do you hear this?

10:55.360 --> 10:57.874
We're singing behind
Jimmy Early tonight!

10:58.000 --> 11:00.230
- I don't do backup.
- Come on, girl.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.397
All we got to do is just sing
a few "oohs" and "aahs."

11:03.520 --> 11:05.750
I don't do "oohs" and "aahs."

11:05.880 --> 11:07.393
Now, you look, Effie.

11:08.800 --> 11:12.839
- This could be our big break.
- Singing backup is a trap.

11:14.440 --> 11:17.557
Now, I'm sorry, Mister,
but we cannot accept your offer.

11:17.960 --> 11:19.678
All right, all right, all right.

11:20.520 --> 11:21.999
Look, I know you're good.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.959
And you know you're good, too.
And very talented.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.789
And not only that,
you are a stone cold fox.

11:29.560 --> 11:30.595
But that ain't enough.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.439
A girl like you can get hurt out there
if you ain't got somebody protecting you.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.516
Now, I'm here to do that for you, baby.
But you got to believe me.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.993
You got to trust in me.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.033
I ain't gonna disappoint you.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.799
- Come on, Effie? What do you say?
- Come on, Effie.

11:44.720 --> 11:47.280
- Well, Mr...
- Curtis Taylor, Jr.

11:48.400 --> 11:52.234
Curtis Taylor, Jr, our manager,

11:53.640 --> 11:56.871
says we're singing behind
Mr Jimmy Early tonight!

11:57.000 --> 11:58.149
Oh, baby, I love you!

11:58.760 --> 12:01.513
This business sure has got
a lot of ups and downs!

12:04.560 --> 12:06.152
Are you ready for the Thunder Man?

12:06.440 --> 12:07.714
Now, he's all the way
down in the basement,

12:07.840 --> 12:11.071
and he ain't coming up
unless he can hear you!

12:11.680 --> 12:13.910
Let's hit it, boys. Showtime.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.112
Hey, Marty, I said no mayonnaise, man.
How many times I got to tell you?

12:17.240 --> 12:19.151
No mayonnaise
on the chicken sandwich!

12:19.280 --> 12:20.918
We got bigger problems, baby.

12:21.040 --> 12:23.076
I warned you to lay off
the women that you work with.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.270
There's plenty other ladies out there.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.753
Well, who got time
to go out and find them, Marty?

12:26.880 --> 12:28.074
I'm always working, baby.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.192
Yeah, 'cause Marty always
keeps you working.

12:31.440 --> 12:34.398
Hell, yeah. That's why I keep letting you
give me the wrong sandwich.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.475
Let's go get this money now.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.956
- Is everything set?
- Yeah, Jimmy's down with the two girls.

12:39.080 --> 12:41.310
This is a group.
It's either three or nothing.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.839
Hey, man, who is this guy?

12:42.960 --> 12:44.757
My clients always work together.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.314
I know you.
Didn't you sell me my Cadillac?

12:47.440 --> 12:49.795
Yeah, yeah. In addition to
my management company,

12:49.920 --> 12:51.558
I have a Cadillac dealership
on Woodward Avenue.

12:51.680 --> 12:55.229
Yeah, well, my kitty needs a tune-up.
And Jimmy only works with two, baby.

12:55.360 --> 12:57.078
Sorry, brother, it's two or nothing.

13:07.640 --> 13:09.198
Those the girls right there?

13:09.320 --> 13:12.278
I think three is gonna work out just fine.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.674
Ladies!

13:14.920 --> 13:18.037
Ladies. Ladies, thank you so much.
You're saving Jimmy's life.

13:18.160 --> 13:20.037
Thank you so much, ladies.
I'm at your feet.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.674
You see that? I'm at your feet, baby.
Thank you so much.

13:22.800 --> 13:27.078
And I'd do anything for y'all. Anything.
You hear what I'm saying? Anything.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.518
Exactly what would you like
Jimmy to do for you, baby?

13:31.280 --> 13:34.636
Well, Mr Early,

13:36.480 --> 13:38.232
you could teach us the song.

13:40.640 --> 13:42.915
<i>Thirteen years</i>

13:43.960 --> 13:47.475
<i>of solid gold platters</i>

13:50.120 --> 13:51.599
<i>Rising costs</i>

13:52.880 --> 13:56.350
<i>And cocktail chatter</i>

13:59.240 --> 14:01.310
<i>Fat deejays</i>

14:03.200 --> 14:05.316
<i>Stereophonic sound</i>

14:06.480 --> 14:08.471
<i>Oh, baby</i>

14:08.960 --> 14:10.439
<i>The game of hits</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:15.834
<i>Goes round and around</i>

14:15.960 --> 14:18.394
<i>But you can fake your way to the top</i>

14:18.520 --> 14:19.669
<i>Round and around</i>

14:19.800 --> 14:21.153
Try that part right there, baby.

14:21.280 --> 14:22.315
<i>Round and around</i>

14:22.440 --> 14:24.032
<i>Fake your way to the top</i>

14:24.160 --> 14:25.115
<i>Round and around</i>

14:25.240 --> 14:27.356
Yeah, you fell right in there,
didn't you, sweetheart?

14:27.480 --> 14:29.277
<i>You can fake your way to the top</i>

14:29.400 --> 14:30.549
<i>Round and around</i>

14:30.680 --> 14:32.591
Shit, I knew you'd have it.

14:33.160 --> 14:35.151
<i>But it's always real, so real</i>

14:35.280 --> 14:37.714
<i>Always so real</i>

14:37.840 --> 14:39.592
<i>When you're coming down</i>

14:40.880 --> 14:42.916
<i>Yeah, yeah, been around</i>

14:43.040 --> 14:45.873
<i>Oh, I know what's happening</i>

14:46.800 --> 14:48.438
<i>I've been around</i>

14:49.720 --> 14:51.995
<i>Faking my way</i>

14:52.440 --> 14:54.715
<i>Through every town</i>

14:55.160 --> 14:57.435
<i>I've made my living</i>

14:58.120 --> 15:00.156
<i>Off of my sound</i>

15:00.640 --> 15:02.312
<i>And the game of hits</i>

15:03.160 --> 15:06.550
<i>It goes around and around</i>
<i>and around and around</i>

15:06.680 --> 15:09.478
<i>Around and around</i>
<i>and around and around</i>

15:38.520 --> 15:40.476
<i>A man gets Ionely</i>

15:41.000 --> 15:42.877
<i>Workin' hard on the road</i>

15:43.800 --> 15:45.916
<i>He's away from his woman</i>

15:46.920 --> 15:49.309
<i>It's a heavy load</i>

16:07.800 --> 16:11.076
That back there is Harlem.
This is Hollywood.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.268
And you ain't welcome in Hollywood.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.669
Time to bring up the lights!

16:21.800 --> 16:25.873
Yeah, let's see which one of these girls
is going home with Jimmy tonight?

16:27.360 --> 16:30.318
I got a nice, warm bed waiting on you.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.231
All right now. Come on now.
Who wants to sit on Daddy's lap?

16:37.800 --> 16:39.518
Yeah!

16:40.960 --> 16:45.590
Mr Early? I don't believe
all this all can be happening to me.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.474
Miracles happen all the time
in the world of R&B, baby.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.512
- What's R&B mean?
- Rough and black.

16:56.200 --> 16:57.952
Mr Early, you're so crazy.

16:58.080 --> 17:00.389
Call me Jimmy, baby. Jimmy.

17:00.840 --> 17:05.789
Oh, Mr Jimmy. You're so crazy.

17:07.720 --> 17:12.077
That does feel nice.
I mean, it feels funny.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.708
You're married, aren't you?

17:14.839 --> 17:16.955
<i>Everybody say yeah</i>

17:17.079 --> 17:18.593
<i>Yeah</i>

17:18.720 --> 17:19.993
<i>Say yeah</i>

17:20.119 --> 17:21.075
<i>Yeah</i>

17:21.200 --> 17:23.474
Everybody knows
Jimmy's married, baby.

17:26.119 --> 17:27.269
Then...

17:28.079 --> 17:30.913
Then you get your married hands off!

17:43.320 --> 17:45.231
So it's gonna take two weeks.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.510
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

17:48.640 --> 17:49.834
<i>Round and around</i>

17:49.960 --> 17:51.359
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

17:51.480 --> 17:52.708
<i>Round and around</i>

17:52.840 --> 17:54.273
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

17:54.400 --> 17:55.799
<i>Round and around</i>

17:56.680 --> 17:57.749
<i>Round and around</i>

17:57.880 --> 18:00.235
<i>You know I faked my way to the top</i>

18:00.360 --> 18:01.759
<i>Round and around</i>

18:03.800 --> 18:06.360
<i>It's always real, so real</i>

18:08.560 --> 18:11.028
<i>When you're coming down</i>

18:11.160 --> 18:15.312
<i>I faked my way, yes, I did</i>

18:20.040 --> 18:21.917
<i>Help me, Jesus</i>

18:22.040 --> 18:24.315
<i>Help, help, help me, Jesus</i>

18:28.920 --> 18:31.036
<i>I faked my way to the top</i>

18:41.880 --> 18:43.871
Did you notice
the seats are periwinkle blue

18:44.000 --> 18:46.719
to go along with
your pretty blue dress? And...

18:48.760 --> 18:50.113
- Would you excuse me?
- Certainly.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.878
Wayne? Help me out.

18:53.360 --> 18:54.349
Hi.

18:54.600 --> 18:56.079
How can I help you today?

18:56.920 --> 19:00.356
Here. This is our periwinkle blue.
Matches your dress.

19:16.760 --> 19:20.514
I'm just saying, you might do better
if you were just a little more, you know...

19:20.640 --> 19:23.837
- Shy? Sugar-sweet, like you?
- Boys seem to like it.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.599
Well, I am not interested
in boys, Deena.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.153
What are you ladies jawing about?

19:28.280 --> 19:31.750
Well, Curtis, we were just wondering...

19:33.800 --> 19:36.155
Do you cheat on your wife,
like Mr Jimmy Early?

19:36.280 --> 19:38.635
Hey, Effie! I don't know her.

19:39.560 --> 19:42.552
Deena's right.
It's really none of our business.

19:42.680 --> 19:44.636
We don't even know if you're married.

19:44.760 --> 19:47.035
I was married. It didn't work out.

19:49.000 --> 19:53.118
Well, was she one of those teeny little
tweety-birds like little Miss Deena here?

19:53.240 --> 19:55.071
Or do you prefer a real woman?

19:55.200 --> 19:57.316
Well, actually, I was raised
by my older sisters,

19:57.440 --> 19:59.510
and they were just as real as you are.

20:00.040 --> 20:02.190
Well, why don't you sit down
and tell me about them?

20:02.320 --> 20:05.312
You know, I would love to,
but give me a minute.

20:15.240 --> 20:17.356
It ain't working, Marty.
That faint used to kill 'em.

20:17.480 --> 20:19.277
- It used to slay 'em in the aisles.
- Slay 'em in the aisles, baby.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.515
But now you got everybody doing it.

20:20.640 --> 20:22.790
You got Otis, J.B.
Everybody doing my shit.

20:22.920 --> 20:23.989
You're right, Jimmy.
Everybody's doing it.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.109
Well, who's the original?

20:25.240 --> 20:26.593
Who was the first one to fall down
and start screaming?

20:26.720 --> 20:27.914
- That was you.
- I'm the first!

20:28.040 --> 20:30.713
And you killed 'em tonight, baby.
It was beautiful, Jimmy. Beautiful.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.637
Marty, you're full of shit, man.
I need something.

20:32.760 --> 20:34.716
Man, I need something...

20:34.840 --> 20:36.637
That's what I need.
Sweet Mother Jesus.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.955
I need that right there!

20:39.280 --> 20:41.111
What you need is a new sound.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.991
What I need is a new Caddy.
That one you sold me is dripping oil.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.316
Hey, Jimmy, you remember C.C.,
Effie's brother?

20:50.440 --> 20:52.317
He's a very talented composer.

20:52.440 --> 20:54.158
Yeah, I remember you.
You wrote that song, <i>Move On.</i>

20:54.280 --> 20:55.793
Move.
The girls be, "Move, move, move."

20:55.920 --> 20:57.114
Yeah, that was me, man.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.153
- All right.
- Yeah.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.589
What did you think of that song, Marty?

21:02.960 --> 21:05.838
Well, I think it was kind of...

21:07.720 --> 21:08.948
You know...

21:10.400 --> 21:15.269
- Kind of boring, I thought.
- Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

21:15.720 --> 21:17.278
It's boring, kid.

21:17.840 --> 21:19.114
I'm no kid, mister.

21:23.040 --> 21:24.837
I'm sorry, baby,
but when Jimmy's involved,

21:24.960 --> 21:26.871
the song got to have some soul!

21:34.040 --> 21:36.270
Damn! Lord have mercy!

21:36.840 --> 21:38.398
Got to have soul!

21:40.680 --> 21:43.353
Soul, gospel, R&B, jazz, blues,

21:43.480 --> 21:45.710
everything else the man
has grabbed from us.

21:45.840 --> 21:47.512
Listen, there's got to be a better way
for us to get our music

21:47.640 --> 21:48.629
to a broader audience,

21:48.760 --> 21:51.593
only this time
with our artists and our money.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.436
Marty, this man is handing me
a line of crap.

21:54.560 --> 21:56.039
Yeah, I know, baby.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.319
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

22:00.440 --> 22:03.398
<i>Got me a Cadillac car</i>

22:05.280 --> 22:08.909
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

22:09.160 --> 22:12.516
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

22:17.200 --> 22:20.237
I know what you cats are trying to do,
and you can forget it.

22:20.360 --> 22:23.875
James Early ain't no street-corner punk
looking for his first date.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.676
He's an established artist
with a recording contract.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.439
On a shitty local label
that can't get him to the pop charts.

22:30.560 --> 22:31.629
We can't do nothing about that.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.718
All I'm asking is one record, man.
One song with a simple hook.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.991
"Look at me in my pretty car,
makes me feel like a movie star."

22:38.120 --> 22:40.475
You know where all the hits
happen these days? In cars, man.

22:40.600 --> 22:44.036
Songs that make you feel good
while you're driving your automobile.

22:44.840 --> 22:45.875
Yeah?

22:47.840 --> 22:49.796
Jimmy's fans like taking the bus.

22:50.800 --> 22:51.994
Let's hit it, Jimmy.

22:54.320 --> 22:57.471
Hey, what do you think about
using that bridge there, baby?

23:01.320 --> 23:02.958
<i>Movin' out</i>

23:03.080 --> 23:04.672
<i>Movin' up</i>

23:04.840 --> 23:06.068
<i>Movin' on</i>

23:06.200 --> 23:07.519
Sounds a little tick-tock, boys.

23:07.640 --> 23:08.834
Let's stay in the pocket.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.474
Going to work! Shut it down!

23:12.080 --> 23:14.150
Recording, <i>Cadillac Car.</i> Take nine.

23:14.280 --> 23:17.192
<i>I got me a Cadillac</i>

23:17.320 --> 23:18.639
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

23:18.760 --> 23:20.990
<i>I got me a Cadillac car</i>

23:21.760 --> 23:23.193
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

23:23.320 --> 23:24.639
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

23:24.760 --> 23:26.637
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

23:28.640 --> 23:30.073
<i>I'm on the move</i>

23:30.360 --> 23:31.759
<i>I'm gettin' on</i>

23:32.040 --> 23:33.268
<i>I'm breakin' out</i>

23:33.400 --> 23:34.992
<i>And it won't take long</i>

23:35.120 --> 23:36.473
<i>Behind the wheel</i>

23:36.600 --> 23:37.919
<i>Got a song</i>

23:38.040 --> 23:39.393
<i>Pedal's down</i>

23:39.520 --> 23:41.909
<i>And I'm gone</i>

23:45.360 --> 23:46.952
We've got that coming up
in the next hour,

23:47.080 --> 23:49.036
but for now,
let me get a hold of your ear.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.718
It's a different sound
for the Thunder Man.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.432
But I think you're gonna enjoy it.

23:54.560 --> 23:56.118
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

23:56.240 --> 23:57.719
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

23:57.840 --> 23:59.751
Oh, my God, Lorrell!
Do you hear that? That's us!

23:59.880 --> 24:01.791
We're on the radio, Curtis!

24:02.400 --> 24:05.676
- What's happening?
- Black station, the signal's too weak.

24:05.800 --> 24:07.233
Turn this boat around! Hurry up!

24:07.360 --> 24:09.396
C.C., fix it! What are you waiting for?

24:10.600 --> 24:12.113
<i>Antenna's up</i>

24:12.240 --> 24:13.389
<i>Top is down</i>

24:13.520 --> 24:14.919
<i>Peelin' out</i>

24:15.040 --> 24:16.359
<i>Don't care where I'm bound</i>

24:16.480 --> 24:17.913
<i>Got these four wheels</i>

24:18.040 --> 24:19.359
<i>Spinnin' round</i>

24:19.480 --> 24:21.072
<i>Me and my two-tone Caddy</i>

24:21.200 --> 24:23.668
<i>Gonna blow this town</i>

24:23.800 --> 24:25.199
<i>Movin' out</i>

24:25.480 --> 24:29.712
<i>Cadillac Car</i> is No. 8 on the R&B charts,
and No. 98 on the pop charts.

24:29.840 --> 24:31.034
<i>Movin' out</i>

24:31.480 --> 24:32.629
<i>Movin' up</i>

24:32.760 --> 24:33.909
<i>Movin' on</i>

24:50.040 --> 24:51.519
<i>Right to the top</i>

25:09.000 --> 25:10.877
<i>Got me a Cadillac</i>

25:11.000 --> 25:13.116
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

25:13.240 --> 25:16.630
<i>Got me a Cadillac car</i>

25:16.760 --> 25:19.672
<i>Oh, I've got me a Cadillac</i>

25:19.800 --> 25:21.836
<i>Cadillac, Cadillac</i>

25:21.960 --> 25:26.033
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

25:26.600 --> 25:30.912
<i>Look at me, mister, I'm a star</i>

25:31.080 --> 25:34.231
<i>Look at me, mister</i>

25:34.840 --> 25:40.153
<i>I'm a star</i>

25:46.120 --> 25:48.076
<i>That's Dave & the Sweethearts</i>
<i>with their marvellous</i>

25:48.200 --> 25:50.236
<i>new recording,</i> Cadillac Car.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.113
You hear this shit?

26:03.040 --> 26:04.393
You hear this shit?

26:05.480 --> 26:07.198
They act like we don't even exist!

26:07.760 --> 26:08.749
Is that how it works, Curtis?

26:08.880 --> 26:10.996
The man decides he wants something,
he just takes it?

26:11.120 --> 26:13.588
I mean, how can they do that?
That's my song.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.554
Our song.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.910
Marty says this happens all the time.
Once something...

26:18.040 --> 26:19.598
That's bullshit, man!
He should have protected us!

26:19.720 --> 26:22.951
Wake up, brother.
The only one that can protect you is me.

26:24.520 --> 26:26.875
Who was the first artist
to sing <i>Hound Dog?</i>

26:27.000 --> 26:28.149
Elvis Presley.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.838
Big Mama Thornton. She had
the No. 1 single on the R&B charts,

26:31.960 --> 26:32.949
but white stations wouldn't play it

26:33.080 --> 26:35.310
because to them it was
just another race record.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.592
We are gonna make friends with the
most important deejays in this country.

26:39.720 --> 26:42.234
It's strictly pay-for-play with those boys.

26:42.360 --> 26:44.555
That takes money. Real money.

26:46.120 --> 26:48.156
What is that? Chicken scratch?

26:49.400 --> 26:50.355
Let's get to work.

26:50.480 --> 26:53.074
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

26:54.920 --> 26:57.115
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

26:59.160 --> 27:01.469
<i>The smile I had is gone away</i>

27:01.600 --> 27:03.830
<i>Those that steal are gonna pay</i>

27:03.960 --> 27:09.432
<i>Steppin' to the bad side today</i>

27:10.440 --> 27:12.715
<i>I'm telling you now, it's got to end</i>

27:12.840 --> 27:14.990
<i>No more trusting them, my friend</i>

27:15.120 --> 27:16.109
<i>Change our style</i>

27:16.240 --> 27:17.275
<i>Change our tone</i>

27:17.400 --> 27:19.197
<i>Make the songs we sing our own</i>

27:19.320 --> 27:21.754
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

27:24.040 --> 27:26.270
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

27:28.280 --> 27:30.635
<i>I'll get you all the breaks you need</i>

27:30.760 --> 27:32.876
<i>In just two years, we'll be in the lead</i>

27:33.000 --> 27:35.116
<i>Can't sit back, it's plain to see</i>

27:35.240 --> 27:37.276
<i>Open your eyes and trust in me</i>

27:37.400 --> 27:39.516
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

27:41.600 --> 27:44.160
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

27:46.440 --> 27:48.556
<i>I was a man who tried to be good</i>

27:48.680 --> 27:50.875
<i>I was always misunderstood</i>

27:51.000 --> 27:52.672
<i>You can't play fair or be too meek</i>

27:52.800 --> 27:54.119
<i>You gotta get way down</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:56.470
<i>and show your danger streak</i>

27:59.240 --> 28:00.559
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

28:00.680 --> 28:03.638
Here's a great new song
from Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.955
<i>Gonna take a mean ride</i>

28:08.520 --> 28:11.273
...a new hit from Jimmy Early
and The Dreamettes.

28:11.400 --> 28:14.278
It's called <i>Steppin' to the Bad Side.</i>

28:43.960 --> 28:47.748
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome</i>
<i>to the Apollo Theatre's legendary stage</i>

28:47.880 --> 28:49.916
<i>Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes,</i>

28:50.040 --> 28:53.271
<i>singing their No. 1 hit,</i>
Steppin' to the Bad Side.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.838
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

28:57.960 --> 28:59.871
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:00.000 --> 29:01.991
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:02.120 --> 29:04.031
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:04.160 --> 29:06.116
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:06.240 --> 29:08.310
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:08.440 --> 29:10.351
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:10.480 --> 29:12.471
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:12.600 --> 29:14.318
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:14.440 --> 29:17.591
<i>I had to step into the bad side</i>

29:18.560 --> 29:21.393
<i>I had to take myself a mean ride</i>

29:22.400 --> 29:25.119
<i>You know that smile I had is gone away</i>

29:25.440 --> 29:27.670
<i>Those that steal are gonna pay</i>

29:27.800 --> 29:31.349
<i>Steppin' to the bad side today</i>

29:31.880 --> 29:33.871
<i>A man just stole my woman from me</i>

29:34.000 --> 29:35.991
<i>He took her down to Tennessee</i>

29:36.120 --> 29:37.758
<i>She was the best girl I ever knew</i>

29:37.880 --> 29:40.155
<i>If it wasn't for him, she'd still be true</i>

29:40.320 --> 29:42.311
<i>Always been a good man, it's been said</i>

29:42.440 --> 29:44.396
<i>When I catch the man</i>
<i>He'll wish he was dead</i>

29:44.520 --> 29:46.511
<i>Men like him make good men mad</i>

29:46.640 --> 29:50.030
<i>Starting today I'm gonna be bad</i>

29:51.320 --> 29:54.392
<i>I'm steppin' to the bad side</i>

29:55.920 --> 29:59.276
<i>I have to take myself a mean ride</i>

30:00.000 --> 30:02.514
<i>You know that smile I had is gone away</i>

30:02.640 --> 30:04.835
<i>Those that steal are gonna pay</i>

30:04.960 --> 30:06.871
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

30:07.000 --> 30:08.911
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

30:09.040 --> 30:10.393
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

30:10.520 --> 30:15.275
<i>Steppin' to the bad side today</i>

30:17.640 --> 30:19.676
<i>- Step on</i>
<i>- Step on to the bad side</i>

30:19.800 --> 30:21.358
<i>Step on to the bad side</i>

30:21.480 --> 30:23.630
<i>- Step on</i>
<i>- Step on to the bad side</i>

30:23.760 --> 30:25.751
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

30:25.880 --> 30:29.190
<i>- Step on</i>
<i>- Step on to the bad side</i>

30:36.360 --> 30:38.794
<i>Steppin' to the bad side</i>

30:40.240 --> 30:44.472
<i>Got to step to the bad side</i>

30:52.040 --> 30:53.393
<i>The motor is now cranked up</i>

30:53.520 --> 30:55.511
<i>and we are moving up</i>
<i>the highway of freedom</i>

30:55.640 --> 30:57.517
<i>toward the city of equality.</i>

30:58.600 --> 31:00.909
<i>And we can't afford to stop now,</i>

31:01.040 --> 31:04.157
<i>because our nation</i>
<i>has a date with destiny.</i>

31:04.280 --> 31:05.998
<i>We must keep moving.</i>

31:06.720 --> 31:09.473
<i>I have a dream this afternoon</i>

31:09.880 --> 31:12.189
<i>that one day right here in Detroit,</i>

31:13.000 --> 31:15.719
<i>Negroes will be able to buy a house</i>

31:15.840 --> 31:18.673
<i>anywhere that their money</i>
<i>will carry them,</i>

31:18.920 --> 31:21.275
<i>and they will be able to get a job.</i>

31:24.040 --> 31:25.598
Made my peach cobbler!

31:26.400 --> 31:27.435
Curtis!

31:27.560 --> 31:30.711
- Hey, baby, you know my sisters.
- Tell me something.

31:30.840 --> 31:33.354
Do you think it's right to promote
an amateur performer

31:33.480 --> 31:35.038
over a professional?

31:35.160 --> 31:36.388
I don't know what this is about.

31:36.520 --> 31:39.557
It's about fairness, Curtis.
It's about people paying their dues.

31:39.680 --> 31:44.151
Ain't that what you keep telling me?
"Get in line, Effie. Wait your turn."

31:44.960 --> 31:49.431
So why am I sitting here without
so much as a B-side on the 45

31:49.560 --> 31:53.269
when an amateur like
Martin Luther King, Jr

31:53.520 --> 31:55.670
gets his own freakin' album?

31:55.800 --> 31:57.950
I mean, can he even sing?

32:10.680 --> 32:12.033
All right, that was a good one.

32:12.160 --> 32:13.912
You're a great man, Curtis.

32:14.720 --> 32:16.995
Isn't your brother a great man?

32:29.200 --> 32:31.509
<i>Never met a man</i>

32:33.160 --> 32:35.549
<i>Quite like you</i>

32:36.960 --> 32:39.394
<i>Doin' all he can</i>

32:40.880 --> 32:43.474
<i>Makin' my dreams come true</i>

32:45.800 --> 32:47.552
<i>You're strong and you're smart</i>

32:47.680 --> 32:49.557
<i>You've taken my heart</i>

32:49.680 --> 32:53.150
<i>And I'll give you the rest of me, too</i>

32:53.560 --> 32:56.552
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

32:56.680 --> 32:59.035
<i>I love you, I do</i>

33:01.600 --> 33:03.238
<i>I love you</i>

33:04.560 --> 33:06.596
<i>Never felt</i>

33:08.440 --> 33:10.874
<i>quite like this</i>

33:11.680 --> 33:14.399
Hold it, hold it. I promise
I'll get to all of you in a minute,

33:14.520 --> 33:16.715
but right now I need
someone that can type.

33:16.840 --> 33:18.398
Anybody got some
secretarial experience?

33:18.520 --> 33:20.476
- I can do it.
- You? Come on.

33:22.240 --> 33:23.559
What's all this?

33:25.120 --> 33:26.633
All right, come in.

33:29.000 --> 33:31.992
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

33:32.120 --> 33:34.680
<i>I love you, I do</i>

33:36.920 --> 33:39.275
<i>You've got the charm</i>

33:39.400 --> 33:42.597
<i>You simply disarm me every time</i>

33:44.840 --> 33:46.717
<i>As long as you drive</i>

33:46.840 --> 33:49.274
<i>I'm along for the ride your way</i>

33:52.840 --> 33:54.558
<i>You said it before</i>

33:54.680 --> 33:56.272
<i>There won't be a door</i>

33:56.400 --> 33:59.198
<i>That's closed to us</i>

34:00.800 --> 34:04.031
<i>I'm puttin' all my trust in you</i>

34:04.520 --> 34:09.639
<i>'Cause you, you'll always be true</i>

34:09.760 --> 34:12.034
<i>I never could have known</i>

34:13.440 --> 34:15.556
<i>This would be</i>

34:16.840 --> 34:19.353
<i>You and you alone</i>

34:22.199 --> 34:24.156
<i>All for me</i>

34:25.840 --> 34:28.070
<i>I know you're the best</i>

34:28.199 --> 34:30.031
<i>You've passed every test</i>

34:30.159 --> 34:33.835
<i>It's almost too good to be true</i>

34:33.960 --> 34:36.952
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

34:37.080 --> 34:39.116
<i>I love you, I do</i>

34:41.840 --> 34:46.755
<i>You're the perfect man for me</i>

34:47.320 --> 34:52.268
<i>I love you, I do</i>

35:03.720 --> 35:05.358
C.C. Wrote it for me.

35:05.480 --> 35:06.993
What do you think, Curtis?

35:08.040 --> 35:10.395
It's too light.
We want light, but not that light.

35:10.520 --> 35:11.555
Not that light?

35:11.680 --> 35:13.875
Okay, but when we fix it,
you're gonna put it in the show, right?

35:14.000 --> 35:14.955
First things first.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.399
I got to get Jimmy booked
down in Miami,

35:16.520 --> 35:17.748
even if I got to buy my own hotel.

35:17.880 --> 35:20.474
But you promised I wouldn't spend
my life singing backup, Curtis.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.555
And I still promise that.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.672
I'm not gonna let this beautiful voice
go to waste.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.713
You just got to trust me.

35:27.920 --> 35:30.798
- Can we talk about it more tonight?
- All night.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.152
- All right.
- Bye, man.

35:36.280 --> 35:38.157
All right.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.392
Boy, you're a real snake.

35:40.520 --> 35:43.159
A cheap, second-rate hustler.
Street-corner con artist.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.748
Look, you want to buy a car, Marty?
Why don't we talk about it in my office?

35:45.880 --> 35:48.269
I'm away a week,
and you cancel dates behind my back.

35:48.400 --> 35:50.391
I spent six months
setting up this tour for Jimmy.

35:50.520 --> 35:52.158
Jimmy's too big for
that Chitlin Circuit shit.

35:52.280 --> 35:54.236
I'm trying to get him booked
at the Paradise in Miami.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.554
- Miami?
- Miami.

35:55.680 --> 35:56.635
You're really drifting out there, chump.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.357
You couldn't get Sammy Davis, Jr
in there.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.790
That place is so white, they
don't even let our boys park the cars.

36:02.920 --> 36:04.478
I got him an audition.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.837
- Luck, man. Hustler's luck.
- That's just the beginning.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.712
Then we're gonna do the Copa,
the Americana.

36:10.840 --> 36:12.159
He could even do <i>American Bandstand.</i>

36:12.280 --> 36:13.713
I've been in this business
too many years

36:13.840 --> 36:17.310
- to listen to some hotshot talk bullshit.
- Not bullshit, Marty. Change.

36:17.440 --> 36:20.637
I'm talking change. Can't you see?
The time is now.

36:20.760 --> 36:24.150
Jimmy needs a new act, something
classier, with a catchier sound.

36:24.280 --> 36:25.633
That'll go down better with white folks.

36:25.760 --> 36:26.875
That'll put him where he should be,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.672
making the type of money
he should be making.

36:28.800 --> 36:31.473
He's at the top of the pop charts.
He's hot.

36:35.320 --> 36:37.709
- We can do this for him.
- We?

36:37.840 --> 36:39.637
- Yeah, we.
- We do nothing.

36:40.120 --> 36:42.873
Jimmy's mine, so back off, Curtis.
Jimmy's mine.

36:43.000 --> 36:44.911
Jimmy don't belong to no one.

36:46.080 --> 36:47.957
Are you defending
this car salesman, Jimmy?

36:48.080 --> 36:49.513
Can't you see he's using you?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.108
Ain't nobody using Jimmy, all right?
Nobody.

36:52.360 --> 36:55.591
Who do you think you're
talking to, baby? It's Marty.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.958
The man who found you singing for
pennies when you were 10 years old.

36:59.080 --> 37:02.072
It's a whole new day, Marty,
and a brand new Jimmy.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.709
You want him, brother? You got him.

37:11.280 --> 37:12.395
I'm through.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.318
- Hey, what you doing?
- You can't have it all, baby.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.749
Hey, come on, Marty, don't go.
I want you to stay.

37:20.960 --> 37:22.632
I love you, Jimmy.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.116
But you can't have it all.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.390
Lady, you got to be Jewish.
Of course, yeah, of course.

37:38.520 --> 37:41.432
It's 105 degrees in here, and you're
the only one wearing a mink stole.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.073
Hey, my friend, what's your nationality?

37:43.200 --> 37:45.634
"Nationality." I know it's a big word.
What are you, Cuban?

37:45.760 --> 37:47.876
Of course. You're Cuban.
You're Cuban, I'm a Jew.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.638
You know, I say this
from the bottom of my heart.

37:49.760 --> 37:52.035
A Negro, if he had enough money,
could move into my neighbourhood.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.593
You, not a chance.

37:55.280 --> 37:56.838
Tonight, though,
we're here to make history.

37:56.960 --> 38:00.396
The first Negro headliners
to ever play Miami Beach.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.839
What do you think of that?

38:01.960 --> 38:03.632
Come on.
It's a very convenient arrangement.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.910
These are good people.
I mean, they can sing, they can dance,

38:06.040 --> 38:09.032
they can even mop up afterwards.
You can't find help like that.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.992
Anyway, please give a warm round
of applause to the very talented

38:14.120 --> 38:17.351
Jimmy Early and The Dreamettes!
Come on!

38:25.640 --> 38:29.315
<i>I want you, baby</i>

38:29.800 --> 38:32.997
<i>I want you</i>

38:33.120 --> 38:35.998
<i>And I need you, baby</i>

38:36.200 --> 38:39.476
<i>I need you</i>

38:39.680 --> 38:40.999
<i>Oh, baby</i>

38:41.120 --> 38:42.599
<i>Baby</i>

38:42.800 --> 38:44.711
<i>You got me on my knees</i>

38:44.840 --> 38:47.035
<i>Got me on my knees</i>

38:47.160 --> 38:49.469
<i>You got me begging</i>

38:49.600 --> 38:52.751
<i>Baby, baby</i>

38:52.880 --> 38:56.031
<i>Baby, baby</i>

38:56.160 --> 39:01.473
<i>Baby, please</i>

39:03.960 --> 39:05.791
<i>I know you don't trust</i>

39:06.640 --> 39:09.359
<i>the way I feel</i>

39:10.840 --> 39:14.071
You know, we can always create
a younger look for <i>American Bandstand.</i>

39:14.200 --> 39:15.155
Yeah.

39:18.800 --> 39:21.314
<i>You got me on my knees</i>

39:23.000 --> 39:25.673
<i>You got me beggin'</i>

39:25.800 --> 39:28.917
<i>Baby, baby</i>

39:29.080 --> 39:31.196
<i>Baby, baby</i>

39:36.160 --> 39:37.878
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

39:43.760 --> 39:46.558
<i>Oh, I want you, baby</i>

39:47.520 --> 39:50.239
<i>And I need you, baby</i>

39:50.360 --> 39:51.998
<i>Yes, I do</i>

39:52.120 --> 39:54.554
<i>I want you</i>

39:57.040 --> 39:59.713
<i>Baby, you got me, baby</i>

39:59.840 --> 40:01.956
<i>Now I'm yours, baby</i>

40:17.200 --> 40:18.758
Yes!

40:30.040 --> 40:32.713
I love me some Jimmy, but he's
gonna have to stop calling me "baby."

40:32.840 --> 40:33.875
I'm a woman now.

40:34.000 --> 40:35.479
Did you see the man
Curtis was sitting with?

40:35.760 --> 40:39.036
Did you hear what I said, Deena?
I am a woman now.

40:39.160 --> 40:41.355
- Lorrell, I know.
- What do you mean, you know?

40:41.480 --> 40:44.358
- Has Jimmy talked?
- He didn't have to.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.596
How could you?
Come on, you're just a baby, Lorrell.

40:46.720 --> 40:50.315
I am not, Deena. I'm a woman now.
I'm 18, so I'm a woman.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.510
Yeah, she's a mature woman, like me,

40:52.640 --> 40:55.393
and she loves Jimmy
just as much as I love Curtis.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.069
- It's not wrong when you love someone.
- Is that all you two can think about?

40:59.200 --> 41:00.269
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:00.640 --> 41:03.074
Well, there's no doubt
my mama brought me up fit.

41:03.200 --> 41:06.875
- Deena, you're just jealous.
- Let yourself go just once.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.958
It's so wonderful
to have somebody to love.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.392
- You ladies decent?
- Well, I am.

41:14.520 --> 41:16.795
- I can't speak for these two.
- Hey, babe.

41:19.720 --> 41:21.870
Curtis, how did it go
with <i>American Bandstand?</i>

41:22.000 --> 41:22.955
Timing's not right.

41:23.080 --> 41:25.833
Well, maybe they'll be more
interested after we play the Copa.

41:25.960 --> 41:27.678
- Y'all ain't playing the Copa.
- What?

41:28.880 --> 41:30.393
I'm breaking you and Jimmy up.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.317
I know what you're doing, Curtis!

41:32.440 --> 41:34.431
You're breaking us up 'cause
you don't want me with Jimmy.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.959
None of you do!
Because you're all jealous!

41:36.080 --> 41:38.514
Well, nothing's breaking me
and Jimmy up! Nothing!

41:40.440 --> 41:42.829
I'm breaking you up because
Jimmy is going back out on the road,

41:42.960 --> 41:44.996
while you stay here
and open your own act.

41:45.160 --> 41:46.718
Did you say our own act?

41:47.280 --> 41:50.590
Finally, Curtis! This is what
I've been waiting for. I love you.

41:50.880 --> 41:52.916
Oh, well, honey, I'm fine with that.
I mean, I love me some Jimmy,

41:53.040 --> 41:54.837
but I don't want to be singing
behind him the rest of my life.

41:54.960 --> 41:57.269
Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting The Dreams.

41:57.400 --> 41:59.391
The Dreamettes were little girls.
You're women now.

41:59.520 --> 42:01.476
- You see, Deena, I told you!
- We open in a week,

42:01.600 --> 42:03.556
so we got a lot of work to do.
We're gonna have a lot of changes.

42:03.680 --> 42:06.069
I'm bringing on Jolly Jenkins
to stage a whole new show.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.953
He's done movies, Broadway,
clubs acts, you name it.

42:09.080 --> 42:11.548
New wigs, the expensive kind.

42:11.840 --> 42:14.638
Brand-new costumes
to appeal to a younger crowd.

42:14.920 --> 42:16.194
And...

42:16.800 --> 42:17.949
Effie?

42:19.440 --> 42:22.796
- Deena's going to sing lead.
- Deena's doing what?

42:24.000 --> 42:25.718
- Lead.
- What do you mean?

42:25.840 --> 42:29.833
- I always sing lead. Tell him, C.C.
- We're trying something new, Effie.

42:32.400 --> 42:35.358
- You knew about this?
- Curtis and I talked it over.

42:36.080 --> 42:37.559
He said it's only temporary.

42:37.840 --> 42:40.400
We finally get the chance
to have our own act

42:40.520 --> 42:42.033
and Deena's doing lead?

42:42.160 --> 42:43.912
She can't sing like I can.

42:44.040 --> 42:46.076
She's right, Curtis. I can't.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.719
I don't want to.

42:49.200 --> 42:52.909
Now, y'all gonna do what I tell you to do.
This is a new sound with a new look.

42:53.040 --> 42:55.600
New look?
Nobody can see her on a record!

42:56.120 --> 42:58.918
The only way we'll be able to change
things is by appealing to kids,

42:59.040 --> 43:00.678
and kids today watch television.

43:00.800 --> 43:04.793
So Deena's going to sing in the lead
'cause you like the way she looks?

43:09.640 --> 43:10.755
Am I ugly to you, Curtis?

43:10.880 --> 43:14.077
Baby, come on. You know
how I feel about you. Come on.

43:15.640 --> 43:18.916
- Don't make it personal.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?

43:19.040 --> 43:21.156
Deena's beautiful and she's
always been beautiful!

43:21.280 --> 43:23.840
But I've got the voice, Curtis!
I've got the voice!

43:23.960 --> 43:26.030
You can't put me in back! You just can't!

43:26.160 --> 43:28.720
Well, you'll be singing backup with me.
What's so wrong with that?

43:28.840 --> 43:31.070
Let Deena do all the work for a change.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.474
Your voice alone is too special.

43:32.600 --> 43:35.592
We need a lighter sound
to cross over to the pop charts.

43:35.720 --> 43:37.278
It's what we need.

43:40.560 --> 43:43.836
<i>What about what I need?</i>

43:44.520 --> 43:46.988
Curtis says it's the
best thing for the group.

43:48.560 --> 43:51.711
<i>What about what's best for me?</i>

43:51.840 --> 43:54.035
He feels The Dreams can cross over.

43:55.360 --> 43:58.557
<i>What about how I feel?</i>

43:59.360 --> 44:02.432
But when we're famous,
I'll write great things for you.

44:03.920 --> 44:06.309
Effie, do it for me.

44:07.160 --> 44:09.799
<i>What about me?</i>

44:10.640 --> 44:14.633
<i>What about me?</i>

44:18.040 --> 44:23.433
<i>It's more than you</i>

44:24.320 --> 44:27.949
<i>It is more than me</i>

44:28.640 --> 44:31.074
<i>No matter what we are</i>

44:31.480 --> 44:34.677
<i>We are a family</i>

44:36.000 --> 44:39.390
<i>This dream is for all of us</i>

44:40.480 --> 44:43.631
<i>This one can be real</i>

44:44.400 --> 44:48.188
<i>And you can't stop us now</i>

44:48.440 --> 44:52.194
<i>Because of how you feel</i>

44:52.320 --> 44:55.756
<i>It's more than you</i>

44:56.120 --> 45:00.830
<i>It is more than me</i>

45:01.040 --> 45:03.873
<i>Whatever dreams we have</i>

45:04.360 --> 45:08.035
<i>They're for the family</i>

45:09.000 --> 45:11.468
<i>We're not alone anymore</i>

45:11.600 --> 45:16.230
<i>Now there are others there</i>

45:17.200 --> 45:20.988
<i>And that dream is big enough</i>

45:21.360 --> 45:24.909
<i>For all of us to share</i>

45:25.040 --> 45:27.395
<i>So don't think you're going</i>

45:27.520 --> 45:31.069
<i>You're not going anywhere</i>

45:31.200 --> 45:35.239
<i>You're staying and taking your share</i>

45:35.360 --> 45:38.830
<i>And if you get afraid again</i>

45:39.560 --> 45:42.791
<i>I'll be there</i>

45:42.960 --> 45:45.349
<i>We are a family</i>

45:45.480 --> 45:48.677
<i>Like a giant tree</i>

45:48.800 --> 45:51.075
<i>Branching out toward the sky</i>

45:51.200 --> 45:53.589
<i>We are a family</i>

45:53.720 --> 45:56.871
<i>We are so much more</i>

45:57.000 --> 45:59.309
<i>Than just you and I</i>

45:59.440 --> 46:01.590
<i>We are a family</i>

46:01.720 --> 46:03.870
<i>Like a giant tree</i>

46:04.000 --> 46:08.516
<i>Growing stronger, growing wiser</i>

46:08.640 --> 46:13.589
<i>We are growing</i>

46:14.000 --> 46:15.911
<i>free</i>

46:16.040 --> 46:19.316
<i>We need you</i>

46:21.560 --> 46:28.193
<i>We are a family</i>

46:45.000 --> 46:46.035
<i>Ladies and gentlemen</i>

46:46.520 --> 46:48.909
<i>the Crystal Room is proud to present</i>

46:49.040 --> 46:54.114

47:02.840 --> 47:05.718

47:09.240 --> 47:11.754
<i>Life's not as bad as it may seem</i>

<i>And all you got to do is dream, baby</i>

47:38.840 --> 47:41.115

48:12.480 --> 48:15.278
I'm amazed, Mr Taylor.
Much as I love my daughter,

48:15.400 --> 48:17.311
I never thought
she had much of a voice.

48:17.440 --> 48:20.398
Deena has something better.
She has a quality.

48:21.080 --> 48:24.675
- You make her sound like a product.
- Product. I like that.

48:24.800 --> 48:28.395
<i>We'll be there</i>

<i>We will be there</i>

49:55.960 --> 49:56.915
<i>We'll be there</i>

50:21.040 --> 50:23.110
Who was the first one
to wear shiny clothes?

50:23.240 --> 50:26.391
- Little Richard.
- That was me, baby! I started that.

50:26.520 --> 50:28.954
You remember that burgundy jacket
I had with the bolt lightning on the back?

50:29.080 --> 50:31.753
Lightning was in glitter.
Glitter's shiny, baby.

50:31.880 --> 50:34.758
- Hey, Jimmy.
<i>...Deena Jones and The Dreams.</i>

50:34.880 --> 50:36.199
<i>Rumours at Abbey Road say</i>

50:36.320 --> 50:38.436
<i>George Martin is keen to work with</i>
<i>the talented trio.</i>

50:38.560 --> 50:40.676
<i>Could they be ready to record</i>
<i>with the Fab Four?</i>

50:40.800 --> 50:42.791
<i>Well, the boys will just have to wait.</i>

50:42.920 --> 50:45.309
<i>These girls are busy</i>
<i>blazing a trail across the globe.</i>

50:53.560 --> 50:55.391
People ask me
how I came up with the sound.

50:55.520 --> 50:56.999
I tell them it's like
making a great sundae.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.395
You start out with two scoops
of ice cream, some sauce,

50:59.520 --> 51:03.069
- and then you put a cherry on top.
- And is Deena the cherry?

51:04.960 --> 51:08.032
Why, Miss Jones is the cherry,
the nuts, the sauce, the cream

51:08.160 --> 51:10.799
- and the banana, too.
- Miss Jones, right here.

51:19.960 --> 51:23.999
<i>We look on with shock and dismay at</i>
<i>the images we're bringing you tonight.</i>

51:24.120 --> 51:28.989
<i>Detroit under siege and in flames</i>

<i>You used to smile just looking at me</i>

<i>Come on, baby</i>

51:43.400 --> 51:45.152
<i>Better lose some weight</i>

51:45.280 --> 51:47.510
<i>Heavy, heavy</i>

51:47.640 --> 51:50.552
<i>You got so heavy, baby</i>

51:51.760 --> 51:52.715
Stop!

51:54.000 --> 51:56.798
Effie, what's going on?
You are still too loud.

51:56.920 --> 52:00.037
- I'm trying, Curtis.
- If you don't ease up, I'll do it for you.

52:00.160 --> 52:01.513
Maybe we should
just come back in the morning.

52:01.640 --> 52:03.790
You know we can't.
The album's already a month late.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.478
Look, I know you're tired.
You're tired, right?

52:05.600 --> 52:06.999
- Can I just get one more?
- Okay.

52:07.120 --> 52:08.519
All right? Okay.

52:09.560 --> 52:11.198
Let's get it right.

52:18.240 --> 52:20.993
Record <i>Heavy, Heavy.</i> Take 30.

52:22.160 --> 52:24.674
<i>Heavy, heavy</i>

52:24.800 --> 52:27.678
<i>You got so heavy, baby</i>

52:28.400 --> 52:30.709
<i>Heavy, heavy</i>

52:30.840 --> 52:34.628
<i>You got so heavy on me</i>

52:38.000 --> 52:39.877
- Where do you think you're going?
- You're a liar, Curtis.

52:40.000 --> 52:40.955
You'd better watch your mouth.

52:41.080 --> 52:43.435
You're sleeping with her

52:46.200 --> 52:48.350
Hey, hey, hey, don't go out there!

52:52.200 --> 52:53.599
Burn it up!

52:57.200 --> 52:59.111
- We're black-owned!
- Yeah!

53:00.800 --> 53:02.711
- You all right?
- I don't feel well, Curtis.

53:02.840 --> 53:06.594
<i>CBS's</i> Star Cavalcade

53:09.040 --> 53:11.156
<i>You got so heavy, baby</i>

53:12.440 --> 53:14.908
<i>Heavy, heavy</i>

53:15.040 --> 53:18.510
<i>You got so heavy on me</i>

53:18.920 --> 53:22.117
<i>You used to want nothing from me</i>

53:22.280 --> 53:25.272
<i>You used to say, "Let's both be free"</i>

53:25.400 --> 53:28.198
<i>You used to dance instead of walk</i>

53:28.320 --> 53:31.232
- Tighten up on camera two. Tighten up.
- Move in, camera two.

53:31.360 --> 53:33.157

Effie, you're going crazy!
Tell me, what have I done?

53:55.600 --> 53:58.034
You stole my dream, Deena,
and you stole my man!

53:58.160 --> 53:59.479
I don't want to hear that kind of talk
out of you...

53:59.600 --> 54:01.318
Don't act like you don't know
what this is about!

54:01.440 --> 54:02.839
Effie, stop screaming.
Everybody can hear you.

54:02.960 --> 54:04.359
I don't care! Let them all hear!

54:04.480 --> 54:07.358
I'm warning you, Effie, you stop
bringing us down! And get back there!

54:07.480 --> 54:11.439
Why, Curtis? You don't need me.
All you care about is her bony ass!

54:11.560 --> 54:13.118
You better back off.

54:14.720 --> 54:16.119
Or what?

54:20.080 --> 54:21.593
I didn't think so.

54:28.880 --> 54:31.440
<i>Love, love me, baby</i>

<i>You're driving me wild</i>

54:38.560 --> 54:41.120
Listen, listen, listen.
The mirrors got to turn together, guys.

54:41.240 --> 54:42.639
They got to dance.

54:42.760 --> 54:46.070
Mr Taylor? We have
a bigger problem on our hands.

54:46.200 --> 54:48.668
Do I have to remind you
that it's New Year's Eve?

54:48.800 --> 54:50.472
Burt, don't worry about it.
I've got it taken care of.

54:50.600 --> 54:54.388
These people are paying 50 bucks.
They expect to see three girls.

54:54.520 --> 54:55.794
Trust me.

54:58.440 --> 55:01.955
- Curtis, I just don't feel right about this.
- It's done.

55:20.760 --> 55:22.352
Wardrobe needs you first.

55:26.800 --> 55:28.438
<i>We are a family</i>

55:28.560 --> 55:30.869
<i>Like a giant tree</i>

55:32.920 --> 55:35.195
<i>We are a family</i>

55:38.200 --> 55:40.555
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Effie.

55:40.880 --> 55:42.871
C.C., sorry I missed rehearsals.

55:43.000 --> 55:45.639
But I went to the doctor,
and I am feeling much better now.

55:45.760 --> 55:47.079
Look, don't try to make it tonight.

55:47.200 --> 55:49.191
What are you talking about, baby?
It's New Year's Eve.

55:49.320 --> 55:51.038
Yeah.
Curtis just stepped out to make a call.

55:51.160 --> 55:54.072
Why don't you go up to your room
and later he'll come up and talk to you?

55:54.560 --> 55:56.232
I said, I'm fine.

55:57.640 --> 56:00.154
Excuse me. I have to get dressed now.

56:02.240 --> 56:03.878
Oh, God, I'm so nervous.

56:04.000 --> 56:06.798
I got all the steps down,
but those harmonies...

56:09.000 --> 56:10.991
C.C., what's going on?

56:11.760 --> 56:14.228
Lorrell, what's going on?

56:15.080 --> 56:17.799
- Effie, Curtis was supposed to...
- Love me.

56:18.960 --> 56:21.315
Curtis was supposed to love me.

56:22.800 --> 56:25.792
There you are, Effie.
I've been looking all over.

56:25.920 --> 56:29.435
<i>I turn my back and find myself</i>
<i>out on the line</i>

56:29.560 --> 56:30.913
<i>You could have warned me</i>

56:31.040 --> 56:33.554
<i>But that would have been too kind</i>

56:33.680 --> 56:36.478
I've been warning you for months
to clean up your act.

56:36.600 --> 56:38.272
You've been late, you've been mean,

56:38.400 --> 56:40.231
giving all kinds of bullshit flack.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.994
<i>That's a lie, that's a lie</i>

56:43.120 --> 56:46.396
<i>It's just I haven't been feeling that well</i>

56:46.520 --> 56:47.475
Effie, please!

56:47.600 --> 56:48.874
Stop excusing yourself.

56:49.000 --> 56:50.319
You've been late, you've been mean,

56:50.440 --> 56:51.873
and getting fatter all the time.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.319
<i>Now, you're lyin', lyin'</i>

56:53.440 --> 56:54.998
<i>I've never been so thin!</i>

56:55.120 --> 56:56.235
<i>You're lyin', you're lyin'</i>

56:56.360 --> 56:57.918
<i>'Cause you're knocking off that piece</i>

56:58.040 --> 56:59.871
<i>Who thinks she's better than everybody</i>

57:00.000 --> 57:01.911
<i>She ain't better than anybody!</i>

57:02.040 --> 57:03.758
<i>She ain't nothing but common!</i>

57:03.880 --> 57:05.154
<i>Now, who you calling common</i>

57:05.280 --> 57:09.512
<i>You self-indulgent, self-absorbed,</i>
<i>non-professional?</i>

57:09.640 --> 57:11.915
<i>You! I'm calling you</i>

57:12.040 --> 57:15.157
<i>I'm calling you the common piece</i>
<i>he's knocking off</i>

57:15.280 --> 57:18.192
<i>Now, you listen to me</i>
<i>Miss Blame It On The World</i>

57:18.320 --> 57:20.629
<i>See, I've put up with you</i>
<i>for much too long</i>

57:20.760 --> 57:22.671
<i>I have put up with your bitching</i>

57:22.800 --> 57:24.279
<i>I've put up with your nagging</i>

57:24.400 --> 57:26.914
<i>And all your screaming, too</i>

57:27.040 --> 57:31.238
<i>Now, when are you two gonna stop</i>
<i>all this fighting?</i>

57:31.360 --> 57:32.509
Stay out of this, Lorrell.

57:32.640 --> 57:33.755
This is between Deena and me.

57:33.880 --> 57:35.632
<i>Yeah? Well, it's between me, too!</i>

57:35.760 --> 57:38.479
<i>I'm as much a part of this group</i>
<i>as anybody else</i>

57:38.600 --> 57:41.637
<i>And I'm tired, Effie, I'm tired</i>

57:41.760 --> 57:43.990
<i>of all the problems you're making us</i>

57:44.120 --> 57:46.315
<i>I always knew you two were together</i>

57:46.440 --> 57:47.395
<i>What?</i>

57:47.520 --> 57:49.875
<i>I always knew you two</i>
<i>were ganging up on me!</i>

57:50.000 --> 57:52.389
<i>She had nothing to do with this change</i>

57:52.520 --> 57:53.839
<i>It was you, it was you</i>

57:53.960 --> 57:56.394
<i>Always thinking of you!</i>

57:56.520 --> 57:59.273
<i>Always thinking of you!</i>

57:59.400 --> 58:00.913
<i>I knew you were trouble from the start</i>

58:01.040 --> 58:02.029
Trouble?

58:02.160 --> 58:04.196
<i>You were real bad trouble from the start</i>

58:04.320 --> 58:05.389
Curtis, I'm your woman.

58:05.520 --> 58:06.475
<i>But you're getting out now</i>

58:06.600 --> 58:08.989
<i>I'm not building this group</i>
<i>to have you tear it apart</i>

58:09.120 --> 58:12.237
<i>Go ahead and rant and scream</i>
<i>and shout!</i>

58:12.360 --> 58:15.557
<i>Don't worry, baby, I'll buy you out</i>

58:15.680 --> 58:18.035
There's no money
dirty enough to buy me out.

58:18.160 --> 58:19.639
You remember that, Curtis.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.591
<i>Lay off, Effie</i>

58:22.120 --> 58:23.394
<i>Just take the money and run</i>

58:23.520 --> 58:25.192
You're in this with him, C.C.?

58:25.320 --> 58:27.436
<i>Cool it, Effie</i>

58:27.920 --> 58:29.433
<i>This time you know what you done</i>

58:29.560 --> 58:31.152
So they bought
your black ass, too, huh?

58:31.280 --> 58:33.396
<i>I said, cool it, Effie</i>

58:33.840 --> 58:35.512
<i>This time you've gone too far</i>

58:35.640 --> 58:37.198
Oh, I can go further! I can go further!

58:37.320 --> 58:40.198
<i>I don't want to stay around this</i>

58:40.560 --> 58:43.438
<i>I'm just breakin' into this business</i>

58:43.560 --> 58:46.120
<i>This is between all of you</i>

58:46.600 --> 58:49.717
<i>- This is none of my affair</i>
<i>- Yeah?</i>

58:49.840 --> 58:51.796
<i>Well, it's between you, too</i>
<i>Now, little sister</i>

58:51.920 --> 58:54.229
<i>This snow job is as much your sin</i>

58:54.360 --> 58:57.113
<i>Look at me! Look at me!</i>

58:57.240 --> 58:59.879
<i>How much did you put out to get in?</i>

59:00.000 --> 59:03.310
<i>Now, you watch your mouth</i>
<i>Watch your mouth, Miss Effie White</i>

59:03.440 --> 59:07.399
<i>'Cause I don't take that talk</i>
<i>from no second-rate diva</i>

59:07.520 --> 59:08.919
<i>who can't sustain</i>

59:09.040 --> 59:12.237
<i>I'm not feeling well, I've got pain</i>

59:12.360 --> 59:15.158
<i>Effie, we all got pain!</i>

59:15.280 --> 59:19.068
<i>For seven years, I've sung with you</i>
<i>I was your sister</i>

59:19.200 --> 59:20.997
<i>You were our trouble</i>

59:21.120 --> 59:26.035
<i>And now you're telling me it's all over</i>

59:26.840 --> 59:32.153
<i>And now we're telling you it's all over</i>

59:32.560 --> 59:36.473
<i>And now I'm telling you I ain't going</i>

59:36.600 --> 59:38.033
<i>It's all over</i>

<i>It's all over</i>

<i>No, no, there's no way</i>

<i>No, no, no way I'm living without you</i>

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:20.594
<i>I'm not living without you</i>

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:25.638
<i>I don't want to be free</i>

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:29.390
<i>I'm staying, I'm staying</i>

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:32.160

01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:56.799
<i>I'm somebody</i>

01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.434
<i>It all started on the streets of Detroit,</i>

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:02.950
<i>where three girls named</i>
<i>Deena, Lorrell and Michelle</i>

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:06.914
<i>dreamed about one day</i>
<i>becoming singing stars.</i>

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.474
<i>Since their triumphant Las Vegas debut,</i>

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.070
<i>they've had No. 1 albums</i>
<i>for each of the last six years.</i>

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:17.273
<i>And they're showing no signs</i>
<i>of slowing down anytime soon.</i>

01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:20.472
<i>But for Deena Jones,</i>
<i>none of these exciting events compare</i>

01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:24.195
<i>to the day she</i>
<i>became Mrs Curtis Taylor, Jr.</i>

01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:28.995
<i>With his wife at his side,</i>
<i>Mr Taylor has built his music empire</i>

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.352
<i>into the most successful Afro-American</i>
<i>business in the United States,</i>

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:37.553
<i>producing such sensations</i>
<i>as The Family Funk,</i>

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.874
<i>Jimmy Early,</i>

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.117
<i>and the phenomenal</i>
<i>Campbell Connection.</i>

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.119
<i>Deena Jones has conquered</i>
<i>the worlds of music and television.</i>

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:49.516
<i>And soon, she hopes to take on</i>
<i>her biggest challenge yet,</i>

01:05:49.640 --> 01:05:53.235
<i>the epic, untold story</i>
<i>of Cleopatra's early years</i>

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:56.352
<i>all set to the music of today.</i>

01:05:57.560 --> 01:06:02.793
<i>No, nobody, nobody, nobody's</i>
<i>gonna hold me down</i>

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.797
<i>I'm somebody</i>

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.068
Thank you.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.274
- How's my beautiful wife?
- Curtis.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:23.870
- I'm not sure how to tell you this.
- Tell me what? Just say it.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.594
I know how much time
you've invested in this movie.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:30.916
But I can't play that part.

01:06:31.880 --> 01:06:33.836
I promised you I was gonna
make you a movie star, right?

01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:35.393
<i>Cleopatra</i> is gonna get us there.

01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.273
I mean, this is the queen of a nation,
not some hooker, junkie, maid.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.595
I know. I know.
It's a very important story.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:41.994
And it's more than you.

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:44.793
Think about all the beautiful black
women that ain't even born yet.

01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.070
When they grow up they're gonna say,
"I can play any part I want to.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:49.111
"Look at Deena Jones. She did it."

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.549
But it's ridiculous. Come on.

01:06:51.680 --> 01:06:53.955
She's 16 years old
for most of the movie.

01:06:54.080 --> 01:06:56.435
Well, baby, you'll always be 16 to me.

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.959
Maybe that's the problem.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.594
Maybe you just don't see me
for who I am.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:09.278
<i>When I first saw you</i>

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:13.794
<i>I said, "Oh, my"</i>

01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:20.233
<i>I said, "Oh, my, that's a dream</i>

01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.960
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.789
<i>I needed a dream</i>

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:30.436
<i>When it all seemed to go bad</i>

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.313
<i>Then I found you</i>

01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.073
<i>And I have had the most</i>
<i>beautiful dreams</i>

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:43.319
<i>Any man's ever had</i>

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.432
<i>When I first saw you</i>

01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.558
<i>I said, "Oh, my</i>

01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:55.396
<i>"Oh, my, that's my dream</i>

01:07:56.080 --> 01:07:58.753
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:04.990
<i>I needed a dream to make me strong</i>

01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:12.198
<i>You were the only reason I had to go on</i>

01:08:15.280 --> 01:08:17.236
<i>You are my dream</i>

01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:22.189
<i>All the things I never knew</i>

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:24.395
<i>You are my dream</i>

01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.229
<i>Who could believe</i>
<i>they could ever come true?</i>

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:31.475
<i>And who would believe</i>

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:36.957
<i>the world would believe</i>
<i>in my dreams, too?</i>

01:08:42.439 --> 01:08:45.796
<i>When I first saw you</i>

01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:49.791
<i>I said, "Oh, my</i>

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.274
<i>"Oh, my</i>

01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:02.872
<i>"That's my dream"</i>

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.673
- What would make you happy, Deena?
- You know.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:23.870
We got plenty of time for that.

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:27.198
Please, Curtis. Let me have your child.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:37.477
- Magic, read your book.
- I'm done.

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.558
Then read it again!

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:43.353
Did you look for work this week,
Miss White?

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:46.513
Mister, you can keep
asking me that question.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.234
But the answer's always
gonna be the same.

01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.917
The only thing I know how to do is sing.

01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.156
And since there ain't nobody
letting me do that no more,

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.316
no, I did not look for a job.

01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:59.798
Have you considered asking
the girl's father for help?

01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:02.598
Magic don't have a father.

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:13.832
Listen.

01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:17.434
<i>I know you have questions</i>

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.233
<i>Same ones as me</i>

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.150
<i>How long has it been?</i>
<i>How long will it be?</i>

01:10:25.880 --> 01:10:30.829
<i>When will come the morning</i>
<i>to drive the night away?</i>

01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:36.557
<i>Tell me, when will come the morning</i>
<i>of a brighter day?</i>

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:38.916
<i>Yeah</i>

01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:44.350
<i>Patience, little sister</i>

01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:49.471
<i>Patience, little brother</i>

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.996
<i>Patience, patience, yeah</i>

01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.514
<i>Take each other by the hand</i>

01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:00.710
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:05.957
<i>Patience, little sisters</i>

01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.076
<i>Patience...</i>

01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:12.473
- It's from your brother.
- Send it back.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.394
- There's cash in here.
- You spend it.

01:11:15.680 --> 01:11:17.477
Effie White, you are a mule.

01:11:17.600 --> 01:11:19.875
Come on, baby, it's time to go to bed.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.116
Just as stubborn as your mother.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.432
Go home, old man.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.794
Magic, come on, baby.

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.231
<i>And a mountain to climb</i>

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:37.949
<i>Patience, patience</i>

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:41.479
<i>It's gonna take some time</i>

01:11:41.960 --> 01:11:43.598
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:48.918
<i>We must walk in peace</i>

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.314
<i>We got to walk in peace</i>

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.510
<i>It's the only</i>

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:55.837
<i>Only way, yes</i>

01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:59.839
<i>If we want to see that morning, yeah</i>

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.632
<i>Of a brighter day</i>

01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:08.918
<i>Patience</i>

01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:09.995
<i>Come on!</i>

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:11.519
<i>Little sister</i>

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.273
<i>Patience</i>

01:12:15.240 --> 01:12:16.559
<i>Little brother</i>

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:22.108
<i>Patience, patience, yeah</i>

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.830
<i>I'm gonna find a way</i>

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.958
Nice to see you, Effie.

01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:31.271
<i>Patience</i>

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.398
<i>Little sister</i>

01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:36.233
<i>Patience</i>

01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:38.438
<i>Little brother</i>

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:42.109
- Teddy, get yourself back to the party.
- I'm waiting for Deena.

01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:04.792
It's good. It's real good.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:06.194
We wanted to surprise you, Curtis.

01:13:06.320 --> 01:13:08.356
That's why we went ahead
and recorded it first.

01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:10.277
This is exactly what I need
right now, Curtis.

01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:13.119
It's what you've been always
talking about to me, a new sound!

01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.992
Still, it's a message song.

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:20.910
It tells the truth.
People are angry out there.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:22.268
I'm angry.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.834
My brother's over in Vietnam
fighting in a pointless war,

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.598
and I'm angry about it.

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:27.914
That's right, Curtis.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:30.235
Isn't music supposed to express
what people are feeling?

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:31.918
Music is supposed to sell.

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:38.277
Look, don't worry about it, Jimmy.
We'll find you some new material.

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.436
Deena, I want you to meet this guy
out here.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:44.792
And about the shirt, you should lose it.
It's messing up your image.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:51.117
I'm so sorry, Jimmy.

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:55.109
Deena.

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:15.076
Honey, you don't need to be
doing that stuff right now.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.230
Come on, brother. It's Christmas.

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.311
Jimmy? Baby?

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.871
I'm not staying around for this.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.229
Brother...

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.119
Yeah, but what about Holiday?

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:16.679
I had Billie here every winter
from '42 to '58.

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.791
Great voice. Bad tipper.

01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:27.155
Well, I tell you, Effie White is the best
singer this town has seen since then.

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:30.033
Yeah, but the last time she performed,
the girl fell apart.

01:15:30.160 --> 01:15:31.479
That was years ago.

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.195
She just lost her confidence for a while.
She's different now.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.593
Max, please. For the old days?

01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.799
They're gone, Marty.

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.838
Sorry, Marty, but the babysitter was late.

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:57.509
Effie White, this is Max Washington.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.029
Hi, Max.
Marty said you needed a singer.

01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:04.350
I was just telling Max
that you're serious about working.

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.518
He knows all about you.

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.518
You do, huh?
Daddy, you don't know the half.

01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:12.359
One night after you hire me,
we'll sit down and I'll tell you

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:15.790
all about how I blew through
half a million dollars in two years!

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.512
- Hey, come on.
- Drinking.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.150
You don't want to take up too much
of the man's time.

01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:24.160
- Now, Carl knows all the songs.
- Carl? Where's Bernard?

01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:25.309
He has a job in Evanston.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:27.078
But I can't sing
with someone I don't know.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:29.191
Effie. You got to.

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.073
Marty, I don't have the time.

01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.310
Max, please. Just give me a minute.

01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.513
Now, you listen, Effie White.
For four months, I've been your money.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.358
I've taken you to every club
in this freezing town,

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.789
and I'm telling you that this is it.

01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.471
It's time that you stop making excuses
so that you don't have to prove anything.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.429
You're gonna have to start proving it,
just like the rest of us.

01:16:56.920 --> 01:16:59.593
I don't know.
Maybe Curtis was right about you.

01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:03.197
You want all of the privileges
but none of the responsibilities.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.352
Hey, Max. Thanks anyway, man.
Sorry for wasting your time.

01:17:07.480 --> 01:17:09.232
Do you know the song?

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:11.357
I told you I didn't want to see her.

01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:15.477
Well, you are, mister. You are.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.991
<i>Look at me</i>

01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:24.479
<i>Look at me</i>

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:32.318
<i>I am changing</i>

01:17:34.440 --> 01:17:37.398
<i>Trying every way I can</i>

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:42.230
<i>I am changing</i>

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:45.911
<i>I'll be better than I am</i>

01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.996
<i>I'm hoping</i>

01:17:50.120 --> 01:17:52.031
<i>To work it out</i>

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:56.233
<i>And I know that I can</i>

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:59.033
<i>But I need you</i>

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:04.518
<i>I need a hand</i>

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:09.119
<i>All of my life, I've been a fool</i>

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.391
<i>who said I could do it all alone</i>

01:18:13.600 --> 01:18:16.956
<i>How many good friends</i>
<i>have I already lost?</i>

01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:20.950
<i>And how many dark nights</i>
<i>have I known?</i>

01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:26.113
<i>Walking down that wrong road</i>

01:18:26.240 --> 01:18:29.789
<i>There was nothing I could find</i>

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:34.438
<i>All those years of darkness</i>

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:37.757
<i>Could make a person blind</i>

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:43.989
<i>But now I can see I am changing</i>

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:48.358
<i>Trying every way I can</i>

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:52.835
<i>I am changing</i>

01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.798
<i>And I'll be better than I am</i>

01:18:57.880 --> 01:19:01.668
<i>But I need a friend</i>

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:07.033
<i>To help me start all over again</i>

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.709
<i>That would be just fine</i>

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.914
<i>I know it's gonna work out this time</i>

01:19:16.600 --> 01:19:20.434
<i>'Cause this time I am</i>

01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:25.840
<i>This time I am</i>

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:34.433
<i>I am changing</i>

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:38.711
<i>I'll get my life together now</i>

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:43.994
<i>I am changing</i>

01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:45.509
<i>Yes!</i>

01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.760
<i>I know how I'm gonna start again</i>

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:56.871
<i>I'm gonna leave my past behind</i>

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.038
Right, baby! Sing it loud!

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:03.676
<i>I'll change my life</i>

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.870
<i>I'll make a vow</i>

01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:15.713
<i>Nothing's gonna stop me</i>

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:24.873
<i>now</i>

01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.351
<i>Tonight, live from the Dorothy Chandler</i>
<i>Pavilion in Los Angeles, California,</i>

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:40.278
<i>it's</i> The Sound of Tomorrow,

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:44.029
<i>celebrating 10 years of hits</i>
<i>from Rainbow Records.</i>

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.795
<i>Every day at school, girl</i>

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:49.195
<i>I see your smiling face</i>

01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:51.436
<i>The teacher tries to call on me</i>

01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:53.232
<i>But I can't concentrate</i>

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.271
Come on, Jimmy, drink this.

01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:59.718
- Five minutes, Mr Early.
- Yeah, all right.

01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:04.273
I thought you were going
to stay clean tonight, baby.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.118
You know how important this is.

01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:09.312
Yeah, I was doing fine, too, till Melba
came out and messed with me.

01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.510
All that, "You never take me nowhere,"

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:14.791
and, "I'm tired of staying in the house
night after night," shit.

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:18.071
Next thing I know, she's coming
down the stairs in her party dress.

01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.752
Wait a minute.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:26.351
Are you telling me that your wife is
out there right now?

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.950
What was I supposed to do, baby?
That's why I needed to relax.

01:21:31.720 --> 01:21:35.872
- Here, sugar, have a drink.
- Yeah, help me out here. I'm frazzled.

01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.034
You know,
it's our anniversary, too, baby.

01:21:41.160 --> 01:21:42.718
Don't you remember?

01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:47.793
- Yeah, I remember that.
- Let me give you a kiss for each year.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.073
That's sweet.

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:54.751
One, two, three,

01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:59.558
four, five, six,

01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:02.873
seven, eight.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:10.995
Eight years of unmarried life.

01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:14.870
Hey, come on, now. Don't tell me
we're going to start this shit again.

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.672
We'll deal with this
after the show, all right?

01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:19.075
Don't you walk out on me, Jimmy Early!

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.316
<i>Girl meets boy, boy meets girl</i>

01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:23.510
<i>Fall in love, perfect world</i>

01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.790
<i>But if boy and girl never meet</i>

01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:28.514
<i>Then a perfect world can never be</i>

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:32.110
<i>Come on, girl, I love you!</i>

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:37.470
- I'm going to tell her, baby, I promise!
- But when, Jimmy? When?

01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.079
Please, I just need
a little more time, all right?

01:22:39.200 --> 01:22:41.919
Time's run out, Jimmy. I get it now.

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:45.794
- What you talking about?
- You never really loved me.

01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:48.912
Lorrell. Baby, you know I love you.

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:52.676
I do. But right now, I got a show to do.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.838
<i>... three, two...</i>

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:01.159
<i>And now, the mellow sounds</i>
<i>of Jimmy Early.</i>

01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:12.349
<i>I meant you no harm</i>

01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:17.474
<i>I never meant to make you cry</i>

01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:23.357
<i>You were the only one</i>
<i>I've ever loved in my life</i>

01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:27.713
<i>And though it's hard for me to show it</i>

01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.152
<i>I've got to let you know it</i>

01:23:31.960 --> 01:23:35.873
<i>'Cause, darling</i>
<i>I love you more each day</i>

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.874
<i>But the words got in my way</i>

01:23:39.000 --> 01:23:43.391
<i>Oh, I meant you no harm</i>

01:23:44.880 --> 01:23:47.758
<i>And I would die</i>

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.314
<i>If you ever said goodbye</i>

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.035
<i>I love you</i>
<i>I love you</i>

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.151
Hey, hold it.

01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:00.280
I can't do it no more.
I can't sing no more sad songs.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:00.678
I can't do it no more.
I can't sing no more sad songs.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:02.711
Hey, Curtis, this is supposed to be
your night, right?

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.831
Let's have some happy times.
Right, I'm gonna give you a count-off.

01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:06.518
The rest of you all come in
when I tell you, all right?

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:07.595
What the hell's he doing?

01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:09.711
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:18.593
Bass man, come on up!
One! Two! Three! Hit me!

01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:23.914
Sound good! Yeah! Saxophone!
On the four!

01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.796
One! Two! Three! Hit it!

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:36.159
Come on! Horns! Hit it!

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:46.237
<i>Hey, Curly, let's rap with Jimmy Early</i>

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.591
<i>Got a home in the hills</i>
<i>Mercedes-Benz, hot swimming pool</i>

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:50.948
<i>Got lots of friends</i>

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:52.752
<i>Got clothes by the acre</i>
<i>Credit to spare</i>

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.235
<i>I could wake up tomorrow</i>
<i>and find nobody there</i>

01:24:55.360 --> 01:24:57.555
<i>But Jimmy want more</i>
<i>Jimmy want more</i>

01:24:57.680 --> 01:25:00.319
<i>Jimmy want, Jimmy want</i>
<i>Jimmy want more!</i>

01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.195
<i>Listen!</i>

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.311
<i>Jimmy want a rib</i>
<i>Jimmy want a steak</i>

01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.351
<i>Jimmy want a piece</i>
<i>of your chocolate cake</i>

01:25:08.480 --> 01:25:10.277
<i>But more than all that</i>
<i>Jimmy wants a break</i>

01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:12.960
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:15.150
<i>Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!</i>

01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:21.471
<i>Sooner or later, the time comes around</i>

01:25:21.600 --> 01:25:23.875
<i>For a man to be a man</i>
<i>Take back his sound</i>

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:26.070
<i>I gotta do somethin' to shake things up</i>

01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:28.191
<i>I like Johnny Mathis</i>
<i>But I can't do that stuff</i>

01:25:28.320 --> 01:25:30.550
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:33.433
<i>Jimmy got S-O-U-L soul!</i>

01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:41.236
<i>I can't do rock, I can't do roll</i>

01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.669
<i>What I can do, baby, is show my soul</i>

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.870
<i>'Cause Jimmy got soul, Jimmy got soul</i>

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:49.151
<i>Jimmy got, Jimmy got, Jimmy got soul!</i>

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:50.349
Take it out.

01:26:03.440 --> 01:26:05.954
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>please stay in your seats.</i>

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.718
<i>We're back live in two minutes.</i>

01:26:08.160 --> 01:26:11.550
- What'd you think of my show, baby?
- You made a fool out of yourself.

01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.750
What are you talking about, man?
I was just being Jimmy.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.110
Lorrell, will you please tell him,
if you can?

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:19.596
Jimmy keeps begging you for something
new, but all you do is ignore him.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.392
Of course he's confused.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.354
It don't take a whiz to know that only
a desperate man would drop his pants

01:26:25.480 --> 01:26:27.914
in living colour on network television.

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.268
Thanks, Lorrell. You told it like it is.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.198
Yeah, well, that ain't all
I got to say to you, sugar.

01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:33.833
My brother, we're through.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.678
What you talking about?
What do you mean, we're through?

01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:37.199
Come on, Jimmy, your time has passed.

01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:39.834
Hey, man, I got soul!
You can't kill a man with soul!

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.791
Come on, man.
Let's at least end as friends, man.

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:44.195
If you ever need some help,
just give me a call.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:49.439
Whatever.

01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:53.948
Hey, Curtis, I don't beg! I don't crawl!
I'm an original!

01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:57.675
Hey, where are you going?
You can't leave me, girl. I love you.

01:27:00.160 --> 01:27:04.676
<i>And Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

01:27:06.400 --> 01:27:11.076
<i>Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:17.831
<i>Lorrell loves Jimmy</i>

01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:22.112
<i>It's true</i>

01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:29.913
<i>But Lorrell and Jimmy</i>

01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:35.712
<i>are through</i>

01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:39.875
I got a show to do.
Don't you remember, baby?

01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.558
<i>And now, please welcome the brightest</i>
<i>star in the Rainbow constellation,</i>

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.592
<i>Deena Jones</i>
<i>with the incredible Dreams!</i>

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:05.355
Hello, America.

01:28:05.480 --> 01:28:07.710
What a wonderful evening.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.035
- I love you all.
- I love you, Deena!

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.517
I love you, too.
Curtis, baby, this is for you.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.758
<i>We are a family, like a giant tree</i>

01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:20.757
<i>Branching out toward the sky</i>

01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.598
<i>We are a family</i>

01:28:22.720 --> 01:28:25.632
<i>We are so much more</i>
<i>More than just you and I</i>

01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.557
Time to go, Mr Early.

01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:34.359
<i>We are growing free</i>

01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:37.153
Yeah!

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.837
You're an incredibly beautiful woman.

01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.677
- Thank you, Jerry.
- No, you're too beautiful.

01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.078
This movie is about three grifters
heading to Vegas for one final score.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.714
When Dawn goes down on
that truck driver,

01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.276
you've got to smell the desperation.

01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:12.277
I know that. That's what I love about her.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:14.789
There's no pretence.
No fucking bullshit.

01:29:16.880 --> 01:29:19.474
America's sweetheart here
has got a potty mouth.

01:29:21.160 --> 01:29:24.835
Of course, if I were to become involved,
we have to do a little work on the part.

01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:28.437
What do you mean?
I spent a year on the script, so...

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:32.792
I know, and it's good.
But she's not real yet.

01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:35.309
To start with,
what kind of name is Dawn?

01:29:35.440 --> 01:29:38.318
I'm from the projects in Detroit and
I ain't ever met a sister named Dawn.

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:41.876
Well, the script's just a blueprint.
It's not written in stone.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.232
I hear Curtis is still trying to get
that crazy black <i>Cleopatra</i> made.

01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:49.477
Is it true he's got some
mob money tied up in this?

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.473
My husband has his hands full
with the music side right now.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.034
That's why I didn't want to bother him
with our meeting today.

01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.154
So, say we do decide
to get in bed with you on this,

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.396
will Curtis even let you do it?

01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:07.075
I hear he's got you
on a pretty tight leash.

01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.792
That won't be a problem, Jerry.

01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.390
<i>Step, step, step on over</i>

01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:17.710
<i>Step, step, step on over</i>

01:30:18.960 --> 01:30:20.632
<i>Wanting you, wanting you</i>

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:22.478
<i>Needing you, needing you</i>

01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:24.269
Shit.

01:30:27.640 --> 01:30:30.473
- Hey.
- I didn't think it was possible, Curtis.

01:30:30.600 --> 01:30:33.353
But I think you can squeeze
even more of the soul out of my music.

01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:35.710
- We just made it danceable, that's all.
- What about the lyrics?

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.717
That rhythm takes all the feeling
out of the music!

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:40.155
This is what you've been asking for.
A totally new sound.

01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:42.350
It's gonna be bigger than R&B
and rock and roll put together!

01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:43.549
People are getting ready to boogie,

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.750
and when they do
they're gonna do it to our music.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:48.758
Your music, Curtis.
It has nothing to do with me.

01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:50.439
Come on, brother,
you know you're my main man.

01:30:50.560 --> 01:30:51.913
Kiss my ass,

01:30:52.320 --> 01:30:53.389
brother.

01:30:58.960 --> 01:31:00.996
What the hell is going on now?

01:31:06.080 --> 01:31:07.513
No, no!

01:31:10.640 --> 01:31:13.598
<i>The body was found at the</i>
<i>Tropicana Hotel in Hollywood.</i>

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.678
<i>Police say Mr Early had been dead</i>
<i>for over a day,</i>

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:19.473
<i>the apparent victim</i>
<i>of a heroin overdose.</i>

01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.070
<i>The 43-year-old R&B singer was</i>
<i>recently released from his contract</i>

01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:24.679
<i>at Rainbow Records.</i>

01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:28.318
She won't let me see him, Deena.

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.268
She won't let me see my Jimmy.

01:31:33.960 --> 01:31:36.349
<i>Plans are being made to fly the body</i>
<i>back to Detroit</i>

01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.629
<i>where there will be a private burial.</i>

01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.079
What a thing.

01:31:39.800 --> 01:31:41.199
Bad, bad scene.

01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:45.278
Well, thanks for the drink.

01:31:46.960 --> 01:31:49.155
Tell Lorrell I'll stop by tomorrow.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:52.158
C.C., man, no matter what troubles
we had, you know, we're still a family.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.918
That's the most important thing.

01:31:55.120 --> 01:31:56.394
It's over, Curtis.

01:31:56.520 --> 01:31:59.557
Oh, come on, man. Jimmy did this
to himself. You know that.

01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:03.193
Michelle?

01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:05.957
C.C. Can quit. You can't.

01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:27.558
What's a wake?

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:31.389
It's when friends get together
and share their love for someone.

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:36.509
- Mama, why are you so slow?
- 'Cause I'm old, baby. I'm old.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.073
Who are you?

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:50.519
Effie!

01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:52.275
Effie!

01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:57.309
- Who's that man?
- That's your uncle, little girl.

01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.798
Effie! Shit.

01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.029
Jimmy had so much life.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:12.798
First time I met him
was right here in this club.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:16.549
He wasn't "Thunder" Early then,
just little Jimmy.

01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:21.871
- How old was that boy, Marty?
- I don't know. Probably 12.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:25.993
Well, he had hands
the size of a fellow twice his age,

01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.355
and he wasn't shy
about using them either.

01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:30.755
Yeah, Jimmy was a real little shit.

01:33:31.280 --> 01:33:33.157
- A real little shit.
- Shit.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:40.517
<i>I miss you, old friend</i>

01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:42.950
<i>Can I hold you?</i>

01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:48.190
<i>And though it's been a long time</i>
<i>Old friend</i>

01:33:48.320 --> 01:33:51.392
<i>Do you mind?</i>

01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:56.357
<i>There were so many things</i>

01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:00.830
<i>I wish I had said</i>

01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:04.996
<i>I meant to love you</i>

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:09.236
<i>But I hurt you instead</i>

01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:13.152
<i>I've come here now</i>

01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.639
<i>To make amends</i>

01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.991
<i>Can I sit down beside you?</i>

01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:25.956
<i>Can we be close again?</i>

01:34:31.720 --> 01:34:33.312
Effie?

01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:35.797
Effie, I'm your brother.
At least you can say hello.

01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.038
What gives you the nerve, C.C.,
coming here after all of these years?

01:34:40.160 --> 01:34:42.276
All I can say is I was young
and I made a mistake.

01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:46.916
I won't be used. Not by you,
not by anybody. Never again.

01:34:47.040 --> 01:34:51.192
I promised you I would write you
a hit song. Let me do it for you now.

01:34:51.400 --> 01:34:53.118
I don't need you.

01:34:54.280 --> 01:34:56.236
No, Effie, I need you.

01:34:57.840 --> 01:35:01.913
Effie, I have a song and it's good.
It's really good.

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.917
But only if you sing it.

01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:23.559
<i>You want all my love and my devotion</i>

01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:30.518
<i>You want my loving soul</i>

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:36.033
<i>Right on the line</i>

01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:39.838
<i>I have no doubt</i>

01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:45.512
<i>That I could love you forever</i>

01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:49.792
<i>The only trouble is</i>

01:35:50.480 --> 01:35:54.234
<i>You really don't have the time</i>

01:35:54.360 --> 01:35:57.796
<i>You've got one night only</i>

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:59.876
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.549
<i>That's all you have to spare</i>

01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.394
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.513
<i>Let's not pretend to care</i>

01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.072
<i>One night only</i>
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.715
<i>Come on, big baby, come on</i>

01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.230
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:32.435
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:37.038
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:42.475
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:48.997
<i>One night only</i>

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.071
- Trying to make a fool of me.
- Well, Nicky said that

01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:56.033
the song's only got local distribution.
Detroit stations mostly.

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:57.559
C.C. Wrote it,
so that means we own it, right?

01:36:57.680 --> 01:36:58.635
Well, technically, yeah.

01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.352
Look, I'll get the lawyers
to draw up an agreement,

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:01.754
we'll demand half the royalties.

01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:03.552
No, no. This is the perfect song
to launch my new sound.

01:37:03.680 --> 01:37:05.159
I want Deena to re-record it
with the girls.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:06.599
Come on, Curtis,
the song's already moving.

01:37:06.720 --> 01:37:07.994
If I can buy a hit, I can buy a flop.

01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.634
Hey, man. This is Effie's big break.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:15.714
- There's other songs.
- It's business. Get on it.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:41.197
<i>Come on, baby</i>

01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:44.559
<i>Come on, baby</i>

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.278
<i>One night only</i>

01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:56.196
<i>You want all my love and my devotion</i>

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:02.880
<i>You want my loving soul</i>
<i>right on the line</i>

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.116
<i>I have no doubt</i>

01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:09.710
<i>That I could love you forever</i>

01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:12.832
<i>The only trouble is</i>

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:15.872
<i>I really don't have the time</i>

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.197
<i>I've got one night only</i>
<i>One night only</i>

01:38:19.320 --> 01:38:22.278
<i>That's all I have to spare</i>

01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:23.958
<i>One night only</i>

01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.072
<i>Let's not to pretend to care</i>

01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:31.557
<i>I've got one night only</i>
<i>One night only</i>

01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:34.240
<i>Come on, big baby, come on</i>

01:38:34.840 --> 01:38:36.114
<i>One night only</i>

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.028
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

01:38:40.720 --> 01:38:43.598
<i>We only have till dawn</i>

01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:48.672
<i>One night only</i>
<i>One night only</i>

01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:10.191
<i>One night only, yeah</i>

01:39:11.440 --> 01:39:13.078
<i>Come on, come on</i>

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:15.555
<i>One night only</i>

01:39:28.600 --> 01:39:30.955
Oh, Cecil Osborne.
Cecil Osborne finally committed.

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:32.957
And he's soaking me
for a million bucks, but I don't care,

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:36.311
because he's great with actors,
<i>Cleopatra</i> is your first movie,

01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:39.000
and I don't want anything
but the best for you, sweetheart.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.069
What's wrong?

01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:45.991
Nothing, Curtis. I guess
I never thought it would really happen.

01:39:46.320 --> 01:39:47.912
You made it happen!

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:51.073
I mean, you are the queen of disco.

01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:53.192
Maybe I'm just tired.

01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.633
Yeah, you got your interviews
and your photo shoot with <i>Vogue,</i>

01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:00.111
private meetings by the pool.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:06.079
You think I'm stupid?

01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.033
When was you gonna tell me?

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:12.638
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I know I should have talked to you.

01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.840
It's just that this part is perfect.

01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:18.394
It's exactly the kind of movie
I should be making.

01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.594
Curtis, baby, nobody knows music
the way you do.

01:40:21.720 --> 01:40:23.597
It's in your blood.

01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:25.633
But movies are different.

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.710
Deena, you know why
I chose you to sing lead?

01:40:37.480 --> 01:40:39.277
Because your voice

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:43.268
has no personality, no depth.

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.871
Except for what I put in it.

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.195
See, nobody knows you like I do.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.277
Well, they offered me the part
and I'm taking it.

01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:52.470
Do you read contracts,
or are you just pretty?

01:40:52.600 --> 01:40:54.989
You can't even take a shit and wipe
your own ass unless I say it's okay.

01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:57.873
- Well, I'll get myself a lawyer.
- What do you think they're gonna do?

01:40:58.000 --> 01:40:59.752
You think them honkies
are gonna wait around

01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:01.199
while you try to drag me into court?

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.276
Forget about it! It's over!

01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:12.835
Listen, I don't want
those men handling you,

01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.951
because they don't know how.

01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:16.468
And, Deena,

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.512
I forgive you.

01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:28.908
Curtis will always be here for you.

01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:37.799
<i>Listen to the song here in my heart</i>

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:45.238
<i>A melody I start but can't complete</i>

01:41:46.320 --> 01:41:52.919
<i>Listen to the sound from deep within</i>

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:59.829
<i>It's only beginning to find release</i>

01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:04.870
<i>Oh, the time has come</i>
<i>for my dreams to be heard</i>

01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.560
<i>They will not be pushed aside</i>

01:42:07.680 --> 01:42:10.433
<i>and turned into your own</i>

01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:15.270
<i>All 'cause you won't listen</i>

01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.838
<i>Listen</i>

01:42:17.960 --> 01:42:21.270
<i>I am alone at a crossroads</i>

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:25.031
<i>I'm not at home in my own home</i>

01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:28.789
<i>And I've tried and tried</i>
<i>to say what's on my mind</i>

01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:32.310
<i>You should have known</i>

01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:35.750
<i>Now I'm done believing you</i>

01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.440
<i>You don't know what I'm feeling</i>

01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:41.950
<i>I'm more than what you made of me</i>

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:46.119
<i>I followed the voice you gave to me</i>

01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:52.591
<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:56.269
<i>You should have listened</i>

01:42:57.040 --> 01:43:00.953
<i>There is someone here inside</i>

01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:03.878
<i>Someone I thought had died</i>

01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:07.356
<i>So long ago</i>

01:43:07.480 --> 01:43:12.349
<i>Oh, I'm screaming out</i>
<i>And my dreams will be heard</i>

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.838
<i>They will not be pushed aside or worse</i>
<i>into your own</i>

01:43:18.160 --> 01:43:23.188
<i>All 'cause you won't listen</i>

01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:25.038
<i>Listen</i>

01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:28.916
<i>I am alone at a crossroads</i>

01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:32.471

<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

01:43:57.640 --> 01:44:00.438
<i>I don't know where I belong</i>

01:44:00.560 --> 01:44:04.473
<i>But I'll be moving on</i>

01:44:04.600 --> 01:44:07.876
<i>If you don't</i>

01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:14.633
<i>If you won't listen</i>

01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:19.556
<i>To the song here in my heart</i>

01:44:19.680 --> 01:44:22.194
<i>A melody I start</i>

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.155

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:32.029
<i>Now I'm done believing you</i>

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:34.594

01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:38.076
<i>I'm more than what you made of me</i>

01:44:38.200 --> 01:44:42.239
<i>I followed the voice</i>
<i>you think you gave to me</i>

01:44:42.640 --> 01:44:48.795
<i>But now I've got to find my own</i>

01:44:49.200 --> 01:44:55.389
<i>My own</i>

01:45:14.640 --> 01:45:17.473
Marty. Long time.

01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:21.476
Yeah, Curtis.
And you're still a second-class snake.

01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.748
First-class to you.
Gentlemen, give me a break.

01:45:27.040 --> 01:45:29.156
Why, Curtis? Did you give Effie one?

01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.159
- I could kill you for what you did to her.
- You couldn't kill shit.

01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.318
I assume you guys have a reason
for barging in here

01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:37.078
other than to insult me.

01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:40.510
Mr Taylor, we're planning to go
to the federal authorities.

01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:44.758
Yeah, we'll tell the feds how
you killed Effie's record. Payola, man.

01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:47.436
You remember, Curtis, I witnessed it all.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.154
The whole dirty operation going back
to <i>Steppin' to the Bad Side.</i>

01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:51.952
That's right you did,
but who's going to believe you?

01:45:52.080 --> 01:45:55.038
All you are is a guy that's pissed off
'cause you got fired.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:57.196
We have documented evidence,
Mr Taylor.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.630
Falsified sales records
to cheat investors out of their profits,

01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:04.799
goods-quality merchandise listed
as cutouts to disguise the fraud,

01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:06.273
mob-backed loans,

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:10.234
and a payola operation
stretching back 11 years.

01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:14.468
Who gave you this?

01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:18.236
Believe me, I had no idea
what Curtis was trying to do to you.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.672
Effie, are you all right?

01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:27.079
I'm happy now, Deena.
I have a child who loves me.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:31.114
- You have a baby?
- Magic's not exactly a baby anymore.

01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:35.509
She's almost nine now.

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:41.510
I wanted to tell you.
At the time, I really wanted to tell you.

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:45.038
Deena, he doesn't know.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.071
Effie, Effie, Effie.

01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:52.833
Well, I see you're just as much trouble
as you ever were.

01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:54.313
Hello, Curtis.

01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:57.116
You haven't changed much, either.

01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:03.990
Actually, I take that back.
You are looking a little heavy, baby.

01:47:04.400 --> 01:47:06.311
You could lose some weight.

01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:16.838
I'll deal with you later.

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:23.110
Mr Taylor agrees it's in everyone's
interest to resolve the situation

01:47:23.240 --> 01:47:25.754
without resorting
to draconian legal measures.

01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.835
Say that in English.

01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:29.952
Nationwide distribution of our
version of <i>One Night Only,</i> Effie.

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:33.072
- On our own label.
- That sounds good to me.

01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:36.192
And remember, Curtis,
if these negotiations fall apart

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:37.912
you're going straight to jail.

01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:39.069
That's right, Curtis.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:42.317
You stopped me once,
but you'll never stop me again.

01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.790
<i>'Cause this time</i>

01:47:47.720 --> 01:47:53.670
<i>Effie White's gonna</i>

01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:56.433
<i>win</i>

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.515
Deena! Get your ass out here!

01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:14.914
Hello, Curtis.

01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:19.079
Hey, May. What are you doing here?
I mean, I thought you said you hate LA.

01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:23.398
Oh, I do. But my daughter said
she needed me, so I'm here.

01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:25.393
Go wait in the car, Mama.

01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.759
That was a dirty trick you pulled on me.

01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:31.757
I had to do something
to stop you, Curtis.

01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.758
- How could you do that to Effie?
- I had to do what I had to.

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:35.909
Where do you think you're going?

01:48:36.040 --> 01:48:38.634
Out looking for a new sound, baby,
just like you.

01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:41.991
- You can't leave.
- Why? Because you own me?

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:45.676
You can sue me.
You can take everything I have!

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:50.555
It don't matter, 'cause I'll start over.
Effie did it and so can I.

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:54.277
Listen, I'm not living without you.
I love you.

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.993
I'm sorry, Curtis.
I can't do this anymore.

01:49:09.480 --> 01:49:11.198
Goodbye.

01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:42.315
Good to see you, Curtis.

01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.239
Mr Taylor?

01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.193
Mr Taylor, this must be
a bittersweet night.

01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:51.039
How does it feel
to say goodbye to The Dreams?

01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:53.276
I don't believe in goodbyes, just hellos.

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:56.153
And I want you all to say hello
to Tania Williams.

01:49:57.800 --> 01:50:01.839
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, back in Detroit</i>
<i>for their farewell performance,</i>

01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:04.310
<i>the incredible Dreams.</i>

01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:20.158
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.716
<i>We've each got to go our separate way</i>

01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:27.037
<i>And now we're standing here helpless</i>

01:50:27.160 --> 01:50:30.470
<i>Looking for something to say</i>

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.831
<i>We've been together a long time</i>

01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:37.236
<i>We never thought it would end</i>

01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:40.478
<i>We were always so close to each other</i>

01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:43.398
<i>You were always my friend</i>

01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:47.149
<i>And it's hard to say goodbye, my love</i>

01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:50.511
<i>It's hard to see you cry, my love</i>

01:50:50.640 --> 01:50:53.677
<i>Hard to open up that door</i>

01:50:53.800 --> 01:50:59.158
<i>When you're not sure</i>
<i>what you're going for</i>

01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:07.516
<i>We didn't want this to happen</i>

01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:10.393
<i>But we shouldn't feel sad</i>

01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:13.796
<i>We had a good life together</i>

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:17.390
<i>Just remember all the times we had</i>

01:51:17.520 --> 01:51:20.796
<i>You know I'll always love you</i>

01:51:20.920 --> 01:51:23.559
<i>You know I'll always care</i>

01:51:23.680 --> 01:51:27.468
<i>And no matter how far I may go</i>

01:51:27.600 --> 01:51:32.469
<i>In my heart you'll always be there</i>

01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:36.797
<i>And it's hard to say goodbye, my love</i>

01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:40.117
<i>It's hard to see you cry, my love</i>

01:51:41.080 --> 01:51:43.753
<i>It's hard to open up that door</i>

01:51:43.880 --> 01:51:47.270
<i>When you're not sure</i>
<i>what you're going for</i>

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:50.039
<i>But we've got to grow</i>
<i>We've got to try</i>

01:51:50.160 --> 01:51:52.230
<i>Though it's hard, so hard</i>

01:51:52.360 --> 01:51:54.191
<i>We have to say goodbye</i>

01:51:54.320 --> 01:51:57.198
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

01:51:57.320 --> 01:52:00.392
<i>But I will always love you</i>

01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:03.751
<i>We didn't make forever</i>

01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:07.236
<i>But I will always love you</i>

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:09.749
<i>It's so hard</i>

01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:12.553
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:15.875
<i>It's so hard</i>

01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:18.710
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:20.193
<i>I'll always love you</i>

01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.356
<i>It's so hard</i>

01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:25.635
<i>Baby, it's so hard</i>

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:28.878
Yeah!

01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:43.832
Well, I guess it's about that time.

01:52:44.280 --> 01:52:45.759
The last song.

01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:49.357
You know, we've been together
a very long time.

01:52:49.480 --> 01:52:52.438
And I promised Lorrell I wouldn't cry.

01:52:53.680 --> 01:52:55.318
And I'm not.

01:52:56.160 --> 01:52:57.991
I'm very happy.

01:52:58.120 --> 01:53:00.714
All of our family is here tonight.

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.559
You know, there really aren't
three Dreams.

01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.238
There are four.

01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:08.876
And we're all here
to sing that song for you.

01:53:09.960 --> 01:53:11.075
Effie.

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:47.513
<i>Every man has his own special dream</i>

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:54.430
<i>And that dream's</i>
<i>just about to come true</i>

01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.519
<i>Life's not as bad as it may seem</i>

01:53:58.640 --> 01:54:04.670
<i>If you open your eyes</i>
<i>to what's in front of you</i>

01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:07.589
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:11.988
<i>Boys, we'll make you happy</i>

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:17.148
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.593
<i>Boys, we'll always care</i>

01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:23.995
<i>We'll always care</i>

01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:26.714
<i>We're your dream girls</i>

01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:30.071
<i>Dream girls will never leave you</i>

01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:33.431
<i>Never, never, never, never,</i>
<i>never leave you</i>

01:54:33.560 --> 01:54:37.633
<i>And all you got to do is dream</i>

01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:41.631
<i>All you got to do is dream</i>

01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:45.673
<i>Just dream and, baby</i>

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.390
<i>we'll be</i>

01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:56.950

<i>We'll be there</i>

<i>We'll be there</i>
