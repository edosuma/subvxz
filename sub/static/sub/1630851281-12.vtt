WEBVTT

00:06.354 --> 00:07.964
I hate beach calls.

00:08.008 --> 00:09.270
Getting this close
to the water

00:09.313 --> 00:11.489
without being able to dive in
is torture.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.752
Not for me.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.145
It's no surprise
there.

00:15.189 --> 00:16.712
Hating one of nature's
greatest gifts

00:16.755 --> 00:18.235
is totally on-brand
for you.

00:18.279 --> 00:21.064
I don't hate the beach.
I'm just not a fan of the ocean.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.326
You know,
psychologically speaking,

00:22.370 --> 00:23.980
fear of the water equates
to a fear

00:24.024 --> 00:26.113
of not being in complete control
of your environment.

00:26.156 --> 00:28.071
Again, on-brand.
Uh, you know, also,

00:28.115 --> 00:30.117
good luck
dating a lifeguard.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.901
Hey, Ash.

00:31.944 --> 00:33.598
Hey.

00:33.642 --> 00:35.122
Wow. When I called
for the cops,

00:35.165 --> 00:37.037
I didn't expect them
to send their best.

00:38.342 --> 00:40.214
And hottest.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.912
Uh,
so you called about a...

00:42.955 --> 00:45.088
Yeah.
It's right over here.

00:47.221 --> 00:48.787
Did you hear her say
"the hottest"?

00:51.181 --> 00:55.142
Washed up an hour ago.
A couple kids found it.

00:55.185 --> 00:56.969
That's why I don't swim
in the ocean.

00:57.013 --> 00:58.884
It's a dumping ground
for sewage, narcotics,

00:58.928 --> 01:01.191
and human remains.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.845
Still feel like going in?

01:09.417 --> 01:11.984
You offer French <i>
and</i> Mandarin?

01:12.028 --> 01:14.161
<i>Yes,</i> <i>
and you don't have to choose.</i>

01:14.204 --> 01:16.467
<i>If Jack is admitted</i> <i>
to Franklin Crest,</i>

01:16.511 --> 01:18.252
<i>he could study both.</i>

01:18.295 --> 01:19.601
He'd be three
when he starts here.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.343
This all sounds amazing.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.040
My pre-school was
my aunt's apartment,

01:24.084 --> 01:26.782
where she watched me
and seven of my cousins.

01:26.825 --> 01:29.611
<i>That must've been so much fun.</i>

01:29.654 --> 01:33.354
<i>But study after study has shown
that nurturing children's minds</i>

01:33.397 --> 01:36.052
<i>between the ages</i> <i>
of three and five is crucial</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:38.750
<i>to a successful</i> <i>
academic career.</i>

01:38.794 --> 01:42.450
[ <i>Chuckles</i>] <i>And where better to</i> <i>
nurture your child than here?</i>

01:42.493 --> 01:43.929
I can see why
they call this place

01:43.973 --> 01:45.627
the Harvard
of pre-schools.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.107
<i>We like to think</i> <i>
of Harvard</i>

01:47.150 --> 01:49.631
<i>as the Franklin Crest</i> <i>
of universities.</i>

01:49.674 --> 01:51.372
And what do you do

01:51.415 --> 01:53.896
to keep the kids from becoming
overprivileged monsters?

01:55.245 --> 01:56.855
What are you doing?

01:56.899 --> 01:59.031
I went to schools
like this most of my life.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.946
Most of the kids were awful,
entitled.

02:00.990 --> 02:03.862
And rich and successful.
Be nice.

02:03.906 --> 02:06.778
I'm sorry. We're having trouble
with the audio on our end.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.650
We were talking
about Harvard.

02:08.693 --> 02:12.915
<i>Right. 80% of our students</i> <i>
attend Ivy League schools.</i>

02:12.958 --> 02:14.525
Oh, and that's
a selling point?

02:14.569 --> 02:16.223
The Ivy League is
a breeding ground

02:16.266 --> 02:17.311
for even more entitlement.

02:19.226 --> 02:20.314
<i>I went to Harvard.</i>

02:20.357 --> 02:21.619
Well...

02:21.663 --> 02:22.838
What was --

02:22.881 --> 02:24.970
Sorry --
Frozen --

02:25.014 --> 02:27.712
You know -- call -- back.

02:29.105 --> 02:30.933
What the hell
are you doing?

02:30.976 --> 02:32.848
Look, I know you are dying
to send Jack here,

02:32.891 --> 02:34.066
but we need to make sure
it's a healthy environment.

02:37.244 --> 02:38.941
I have to get to work.

02:38.984 --> 02:42.074
Call them back and reschedule
the rest of the interview.

02:42.118 --> 02:44.251
Sometimes I just can't believe you.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.951
Hey!
Oh, congratulations!

02:48.994 --> 02:51.910
John Nolan,
Union Delegate.

02:51.954 --> 02:53.303
How do you feel?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.044
I feel amazing.
This is incredible.

02:55.087 --> 02:56.654
Guys, you didn't do this
all yourselves, did you?

02:56.698 --> 02:58.265
Oh, my goodness.
No.

02:58.308 --> 02:59.875
Uh, they were just left
at the front desk.

02:59.918 --> 03:02.530
Oh. "To LAPD's
newest union delegate.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.401
From your friends
at the mayor's office."

03:04.445 --> 03:05.663
Wow.

03:05.707 --> 03:07.622
I am so happy for you.

03:07.665 --> 03:11.321
John, you worked
really, really hard to get this,

03:11.365 --> 03:14.237
and I think you are gonna do
just an amazing job.

03:14.281 --> 03:15.934
Thank you. That --
That actually means a lot to me.

03:15.978 --> 03:17.414
- Are you okay?
- Uh, yeah.

03:17.458 --> 03:21.244
Uh, it's -- it's, uh,
the pregnancy hormones.

03:21.288 --> 03:24.378
They -- They make me,
uh, pathologically cheerful.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.944
Oh.
So, um...

03:25.988 --> 03:27.859
Seriously,
it's the worst thing.

03:27.903 --> 03:30.775
Um, I am gonna go
set up the shop,

03:30.819 --> 03:33.517
and I will let you all
deal with this long line.

03:33.561 --> 03:36.346
What long line?
Oh, yes.

03:36.390 --> 03:38.218
So, in honor of your first day
as union delegate,

03:38.261 --> 03:41.133
half the cops
in the station want to, um --

03:41.177 --> 03:43.310
well, they --
they want to talk to you.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.789
That's what I'm gonna talk
to him about.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.793
They haven't restocked
the vending machine

03:48.837 --> 03:50.142
with cheese puffs
in six months.

03:50.186 --> 03:51.535
I need my puffs.

03:51.579 --> 03:53.407
A citizen just filed
a complaint.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.538
I need you
to represent me.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.018
So, what was
the complaint?

03:56.061 --> 03:58.020
I was taking a statement
from a homeowner,

03:58.063 --> 03:59.978
and, well, I needed to use
her bathroom,

04:00.022 --> 04:01.371
and now she's claiming
that I destroyed her toilet.

04:01.415 --> 04:04.548
I want to use a .44 Magnum
as my duty weapon.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.334
When are we getting
air-conditioned body armor?

04:07.377 --> 04:11.251
I'm just looking to get my
emotional support pig deputized.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.383
Seriously?

04:13.427 --> 04:15.472
You had this job
yesterday.

04:15.516 --> 04:18.127
Already cracking
under the stress, Nolan?

04:18.170 --> 04:19.911
No. I'm just wondering
what you were doing

04:19.955 --> 04:21.696
for the last 12 years
as union rep.

04:21.739 --> 04:24.089
It seems like none of these
people's needs were being met.

04:24.133 --> 04:27.267
Yeah, cops always find something
to whine about.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.138
Plus,
I told everybody

04:29.181 --> 04:31.662
how eager you are
to hear their problems.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.708
No matter how small.
You're welcome.

04:35.753 --> 04:38.060
Already hard at work,
I see.

04:38.103 --> 04:39.235
Yes, sir.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.932
Lieutenant Landon Briggs.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.064
I'm the Union --President.

04:42.107 --> 04:43.892
Yes, I know.
Great to finally meet you.

04:43.935 --> 04:46.111
Consider this
a welcome present.

04:46.155 --> 04:49.332
But my small gift
is only the beginning.

04:49.376 --> 04:52.074
You're about to be
wined and dined
across this great city.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.337
I've already received
a-a few gifts,

04:54.381 --> 04:55.904
but I'm just excited
to get started.

04:55.947 --> 04:57.122
I-I'm glad you
stopped by.

04:57.166 --> 04:58.602
What's a good e-mail
for you

04:58.646 --> 05:00.430
so I can send you a list
of my proposals?

05:00.474 --> 05:02.954
- I'm sorry -- proposals?
- Yeah.

05:02.998 --> 05:05.261
I, um, campaigned
on the promise of change.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.829
At the top of the list
is a mental health initiative

05:07.872 --> 05:09.918
that dispatches counselors
on all calls

05:09.961 --> 05:11.006
involving mental illness.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.051
Oh, slow down there, son.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.750
Our fight right now isn't about
the people out there.

05:15.793 --> 05:18.361
It's about making sure
our brothers in blue

05:18.405 --> 05:21.495
get everything they deserve --
uh, paid overtime, benefits.

05:21.538 --> 05:23.453
Eh...

05:23.497 --> 05:24.976
there'll be time
for your list later.

05:25.020 --> 05:28.371
The most important thing now
is to relax.

05:28.415 --> 05:29.677
Enjoy your victory.

05:32.984 --> 05:34.769
Hey. Heard about that hand
that washed up yesterday.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.162
God, I know.
It's super gross, right?

05:37.206 --> 05:39.164
You got any theories?

05:39.208 --> 05:41.515
A couple. I...

05:41.558 --> 05:43.778
At first, I was thinking
maybe human trafficking,

05:43.821 --> 05:45.736
maybe the boat capsized,
took someone's hand off,

05:45.780 --> 05:48.173
but then I realized that
the way the hand was severed

05:48.217 --> 05:50.393
spoke more
- to some type of torture.
- Ah.

05:50.437 --> 05:52.700
Sorry, I
watch a lot of true crime.

05:52.743 --> 05:53.701
Oh, me, too.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.224
I'm actually thinking

05:55.267 --> 05:57.618
it's a "Gone Girl" gone wrong
scenario.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.359
Ooh, I like that.

05:59.402 --> 06:02.100
Yeah, maybe she was, uh,
trying to fake a drowning,

06:02.144 --> 06:03.841
but then got caught
in her boat propeller.

06:03.885 --> 06:06.453
Exactly, yeah.
Nice.

06:06.496 --> 06:08.063
- I'll see you around.
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.456
Hey.
Hi.

06:09.499 --> 06:11.414
What's that look?

06:11.458 --> 06:13.198
N-Nothing.
What?

06:13.242 --> 06:14.896
You wanted to strangle that guy
last week.

06:14.939 --> 06:17.246
Now you're all
sweet on him?"Sweet on him"?

06:17.289 --> 06:20.380
What? Did -- Did we suddenly
just get dropped in the 1950s?

06:20.423 --> 06:23.252
What?
All done.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.950
Who knew a dead hand
would require so much paperwork?

06:25.994 --> 06:27.865
Oh, hey,
do you have plans tonight?

06:27.909 --> 06:29.432
No. Why?

06:29.476 --> 06:31.826
My friend Olive won
four raffle tickets

06:31.869 --> 06:34.698
to this fancy dinner thing,
and she just invited us.

06:34.742 --> 06:36.396
What's
a "fancy dinner thing"?

06:36.439 --> 06:38.049
It's called Osia.

06:38.093 --> 06:40.182
It's an exclusive pop-up
on the beach in Malibu --

06:40.225 --> 06:42.053
one night only,
12 fusion courses,

06:42.097 --> 06:43.577
wine pairings
included.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.840
"An experiment
in molecular gastronomy."

06:45.883 --> 06:47.581
I'll have to
think about it.

06:47.624 --> 06:49.974
What's there
to think about?

06:50.018 --> 06:51.672
Uh, the control freak
in him

06:51.715 --> 06:53.630
doesn't like to try
new things, so...

06:53.674 --> 06:54.805
I'm not
a control freak.

06:56.590 --> 06:59.419
I would be happy
to go to your dinner thing.

07:03.031 --> 07:03.945
Sergeant Grey?

07:05.337 --> 07:07.470
Lieutenant...
Caba-relli?

07:07.514 --> 07:09.167
It's <i>Cabarelli.</i>
Ah.

07:09.211 --> 07:11.082
But call me Romeo.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.345
Uh, thank you.
Wade.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.565
- And how was your flight?
- Eh, good, I suppose.

07:15.609 --> 07:17.437
A little tight perhaps.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.221
The <i>Carabinieri</i> does not pay
for business class.

07:19.264 --> 07:22.093
You're talking to a large man.
- Trust me, I understand.
- Yeah.

07:22.137 --> 07:25.096
So, you're hunting a fugitive.
Tell me about him.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.663
Kai Zullo.

07:26.707 --> 07:29.753
Murdered a woman
in a home invasion in Rome.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.495
Made off with 100,000 Euros
worth of diamonds.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.541
Landed in Los Angeles
three days ago.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.325
Does he have any family
or friends here?

07:36.368 --> 07:38.675
No. We believe he wants to hide
in a large city

07:38.719 --> 07:40.764
until he can escape
to South America.

07:40.808 --> 07:42.113
He's fluent
in many languages.

07:42.157 --> 07:44.159
Well, he came
to the right place.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.640
You can hide another city
in this city.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.642
But the LAPD's pretty good
at finding people.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.600
Listen, I don't want to be
a burden.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.297
I'm sure
you're stretched thin.

07:52.341 --> 07:56.127
I simply need an
escorting officer with a pulse.

07:56.171 --> 07:59.087
Not to sing my own praises,
but I'm an expert lawman.

07:59.130 --> 08:04.266
Look, I have no doubt,
and I <i>am</i> stretched very thin,

08:04.309 --> 08:07.008
but it would be my honor
to work this case with you.

08:07.051 --> 08:09.358
I can't possibly ask you
to do that.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.968
I insist.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.014
I'm always looking for a way
to stretch my legs.

08:13.057 --> 08:14.537
Yeah, I do the same.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.452
So here's
your carry permit.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.456
And, you know,
I have a C.I. we can go see.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.414
And you can tell me more
about our suspect on the way.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.591
And when did the break-in
take place, Mr. Swaine?

08:24.634 --> 08:26.680
Around 2:00 a.m.

08:26.723 --> 08:27.985
Okay,
what was taken?

08:28.029 --> 08:29.726
I can't say.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.206
I'm -- I'm sorry.
I don't understand.

08:31.249 --> 08:32.512
Well, if I told you,

08:32.555 --> 08:35.079
I'd be revealing ManMade Labs'
trade secrets.

08:35.123 --> 08:36.777
My company works
at the forefront

08:36.820 --> 08:39.519
of biotechnological
advancement.

08:39.562 --> 08:42.434
You're asking me to reveal
highly confidential information.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.480
Okay. Can you at least tell me
who was working at that time?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.438
I'll have to check with
the lawyers on that one.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.266
How about showing me
where the burglary happened?

08:48.310 --> 08:49.746
That way, we can have TID
dust for prints.

08:49.790 --> 08:51.443
I'm afraid
that's not possible.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.315
We have several
government clients.

08:53.358 --> 08:56.144
You don't have clearance
to go farther than the lobby.

08:56.187 --> 08:57.928
We can't do our job
without access.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.757
Oh, was I --
was I not clear?

09:00.801 --> 09:02.454
I don't expect you to.

09:02.498 --> 09:05.849
I-I just need a case number
for insurance purposes.

09:05.893 --> 09:07.590
Sorry I'm late.
I had to yell at my husband.

09:07.634 --> 09:10.071
Detective Angela Lopez.

09:10.114 --> 09:12.464
Devon Swaine, CEO.

09:12.508 --> 09:14.510
I apologize you had to come
all the way down here.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.338
As I was telling
this officer,

09:16.381 --> 09:18.601
this matter's
extremely sensitive.

09:18.645 --> 09:21.125
We'll be handling it
in-house.

09:21.169 --> 09:22.474
You can send over
that case number

09:22.518 --> 09:23.650
whenever you get
the chance.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.260
Thanks.

09:32.354 --> 09:34.051
How do you want to
handle this?

09:34.095 --> 09:35.879
If they don't want our help,
there's not much we can do.

09:35.923 --> 09:38.099
Just write it up
and send it over.

09:38.142 --> 09:39.796
We heard
you got a body.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.493
Yeah. He'd already lost
a lot of blood

09:41.537 --> 09:43.104
when he got here.

09:43.147 --> 09:45.062
We did everything we could,
but he bled out.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.720
Stabbing?
No.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.376
Someone cut off
his hand.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.645
How clandestine.
I could be in "Dirty Harry."

10:05.039 --> 10:08.085
American police work.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.871
Is it really how
the movies make it look?

10:10.914 --> 10:13.090
Oh, "Dirty Harry" is
pretty outdated.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.963
But, uh...
Alright, here's my guy now.

10:16.006 --> 10:17.921

10:21.969 --> 10:23.797

10:23.840 --> 10:25.625
Who's he?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.410
Romeo is an officer of
the Italian Car-a-binieri.

10:28.453 --> 10:29.585
<i>Carabinieri.</i>

10:29.629 --> 10:31.805
- The what?
- He's a cop.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.110
Just do
what he tells you.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.592
We're looking for a man
named Kai Zullo.

10:36.636 --> 10:39.377
White, six-foot, Italian --
like me.

10:39.421 --> 10:42.076
He's in possession of stolen
jewels from my country --

10:42.119 --> 10:43.860
diamond rings, necklaces,
brooches.

10:43.904 --> 10:46.733
He's an international fugitive
wanted on a murder charge.

10:46.776 --> 10:49.387
Finding him is a big deal.

10:49.431 --> 10:52.129
Yeah, I'll do my best.

10:52.173 --> 10:53.957
No guarantees.

everywhere.

10:59.136 --> 11:00.398
Even the shifty eyes.

11:02.444 --> 11:03.314
So, what now?

11:03.358 --> 11:05.665
Let me guess.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.754
We'll "hit the streets
and see who else is talking."

11:07.797 --> 11:08.972
Not exactly.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.628
How about
"Reach for the sky"?

11:12.672 --> 11:13.629
Do you still say that?

11:13.673 --> 11:15.457
Have you seen
any cop movie

11:15.500 --> 11:17.285
that was made
in the past 40 years?

11:18.982 --> 11:20.505
Why are you wasting
my client's time, Detective?

11:20.549 --> 11:22.029
He is a busy CEO.

11:22.072 --> 11:23.508
I just have
a few questions.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.467
Which he already told you
he can't answer.

11:25.510 --> 11:27.338
Well, your client
might want to reconsider

11:27.382 --> 11:29.471
now that one of his employees
turned up dead.

11:29.514 --> 11:32.256
- Who?
- Mark Kilkea.

11:32.300 --> 11:34.694
Someone cut off his hand to get
past the palm scanners

11:34.737 --> 11:36.565
throughout your offices.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.785
They left him for dead,
but he somehow managed

11:38.828 --> 11:40.743
to get himself up
and stumbled into a hospital

11:40.787 --> 11:42.789
almost 24 hours later.

11:42.832 --> 11:44.965
That's horrible, but my client
has nothing to do with that.

11:45.008 --> 11:46.923
Maybe not,
but given the company's

11:46.967 --> 11:49.012
high-tech
security protocols,

11:49.056 --> 11:50.405
there's no way
your client wasn't aware

11:50.448 --> 11:52.624
that Kilkea palmed his way
into the office

11:52.668 --> 11:54.017
right before
the robbery.

11:54.061 --> 11:55.802
But you didn't share that,
did you?

11:55.845 --> 11:58.195
In fact, according to
Mr. Kilkea's neighbors,

11:58.239 --> 12:00.197
two security officers
from your company

12:00.241 --> 12:02.678
showed up at our victim's door
right after the robbery.

12:02.722 --> 12:03.897
As you are well aware,

12:03.940 --> 12:06.116
my client's business
is highly proprietary.

12:06.160 --> 12:08.118
Yep.
I looked into that.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.686
According to your website,
the company you founded

12:10.730 --> 12:14.516
is "a pioneering force in
biotechnological engineering,

12:14.559 --> 12:17.562
making it possible
for humans to live better lives

12:17.606 --> 12:19.521
in our modern world."

12:19.564 --> 12:21.218
What are you guys making
over there?

12:21.262 --> 12:23.003
Widgets.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.831
Either you answer
my question,

12:24.874 --> 12:26.571
or we will freeze
and hold your company

12:26.615 --> 12:28.269
until we can obtain
a search warrant,

12:28.312 --> 12:30.053
and you won't sell any widgets
until I say so.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.838
Yeah, I'm not gonna
let you do that.

12:31.881 --> 12:33.056
It's a crime scene.

12:33.100 --> 12:34.884
It's my discretion
on how to process it.

12:34.928 --> 12:36.364
Let me help you out.

12:36.407 --> 12:40.672
You created the fastest,
smallest microchip in the world,

12:40.716 --> 12:42.065
and it's about to
go to market.

12:42.109 --> 12:43.327
Does that sound
about right?

12:43.371 --> 12:45.155
Where did you get that
information?

12:45.199 --> 12:48.680
Well, they just don't give
these out to anyone.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.334
What are the chips
used for?

12:50.378 --> 12:53.337
To bridge the gap between
technology and biology,

12:53.381 --> 12:55.122
and that's all
I'm going to say.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.646
And can you think of anyone
who would cut off a guy's hand

12:57.689 --> 12:58.734
to steal this tech?

13:00.954 --> 13:02.694
Chester Frey.

13:02.738 --> 13:04.827
I fired him
about six months ago

13:04.871 --> 13:07.134
for performing experiments
off-site,

13:07.177 --> 13:09.701
doing research
my company never approved.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.051
He called me last week,

13:11.094 --> 13:13.053
insisting he was close
to a breakthrough,

13:13.096 --> 13:14.968
begged me to let him access
our lab again.

13:15.011 --> 13:16.926
I told him
to lose my number.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.450
And how dangerous would you say
Chester Frey is?

13:19.494 --> 13:22.410
He's the worst kind of crazy,
Detective.

13:22.453 --> 13:24.194
He's a zealot.

13:24.238 --> 13:25.630
So, what's next?

13:25.674 --> 13:26.893
Morning sickness,
food cravings?

13:26.936 --> 13:28.633
All of it.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.636
If it is a pregnancy
side effect, I will get it.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.465
But it's just all such
a blessing. Yeah.

13:34.509 --> 13:36.511
Oh.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.689
John Nolan.
<i>Officer Nolan.</i>

13:40.732 --> 13:42.604

13:50.394 --> 13:52.135
Well,

13:52.179 --> 13:54.703
I do have a couple of ideas
I've been kicking around.

13:54.746 --> 13:56.574
<i>Actually, I have a meeting</i>

13:56.618 --> 13:58.576

<i>I can swing by after,</i> <i>

14:01.014 --> 14:02.711
That is perfect.
Thank you very much.

14:02.754 --> 14:04.017
I am looking forward.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.280
<i>Me, too.</i>

14:06.323 --> 14:09.109
Wow. Okay.
See, this is why I ran.

14:09.152 --> 14:11.067
A chance to talk
about real issues.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.026
7-Adam-15, this is Lopez.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.637
<i>I have an ID on our hand-thief</i> <i>

<i>and additional units</i> <i>

14:21.948 --> 14:23.297
Copy that.
We are on our way.

14:23.340 --> 14:25.995
And thank you so much
for calling.

14:28.345 --> 14:29.999
I know. It's --
It's freaking me out, too.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.611
Police!

14:34.786 --> 14:36.788
God,
it's like a freezer in here.

14:41.228 --> 14:43.056
Chester?

14:43.099 --> 14:45.232
Come on up now.
Show me your hands.

14:54.545 --> 14:56.199
Clear upstairs.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.729
Clear.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.737
This place...

15:12.781 --> 15:14.174
Do you hear that?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.830
Police!

15:30.320 --> 15:31.539
Um, Nolan...

15:42.332 --> 15:44.987
And here we have
a severed arm,

15:45.031 --> 15:46.641
moving all on its own.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.208
Uh...

15:48.251 --> 15:49.905
I can't stop staring.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.776
I think it's amazing.

15:51.820 --> 15:54.257
I mean, the human body --

15:54.301 --> 15:57.608
this truly is a miracle.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.914
Is she okay?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.568
Pregnancy hormones.

16:00.611 --> 16:03.005
Cool. Any sign
of our Dr. Frankenstein?

16:03.049 --> 16:04.659
No. He left plenty
of evidence behind --

16:04.702 --> 16:06.487
notebooks, computers.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.619
Hopefully, we can learn
what scientific breakthrough

16:08.663 --> 16:10.012
he thinks
he's so close to.

16:10.056 --> 16:11.796
Yeah, and where
to look for him next.

16:13.668 --> 16:15.452
- Be right back.
- Yeah.

16:17.889 --> 16:19.979
Any sign of Chester?
No.

16:20.022 --> 16:23.069
So, Chester cut off
Mark Kilkea's hand,

16:23.112 --> 16:25.114
and now there's a severed arm
in his house.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.160
- That's two victims.
- Afraid there's more.

16:27.203 --> 16:29.727
Harper and Nolan found a freezer
with eight more arms inside.

16:29.771 --> 16:32.948
So, is that four more victims,
or eight?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.298
Six, I think.
Four right, two left.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.908
On the initial exam,
the ME thinks

16:36.952 --> 16:38.258
they were removed
post-mortem.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.912
Two of them had clear signs
of decomposition.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.045
So what?
He's a grave robber?

16:43.089 --> 16:44.481
We don't know yet.

16:44.525 --> 16:46.048
Well, tell TID
to get a rush on the prints.

16:46.092 --> 16:47.354
If we can get hits
on his victims,

16:47.397 --> 16:49.051
it might tell us
where he got the limbs from

16:49.095 --> 16:51.053
- and who he targets.
- On it.

16:51.097 --> 16:52.794
Detective Lopez.

16:55.623 --> 16:57.668
What do you want,
Mr. Karga?

16:57.712 --> 17:00.193
Access to
Chester Frey's house.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.238
He stole proprietary property
from my client,

17:02.282 --> 17:04.458
- and I need to retrieve it.
- That would be a no.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.850
This is
an active crime scene --

17:05.894 --> 17:07.069
I don't think
you understand.

17:07.113 --> 17:09.289
If my client's technology
is leaked,

17:09.332 --> 17:12.814
it will destroy
a billion dollars' worth of R&D.

17:12.857 --> 17:16.122
And the LAPD isn't exactly known
for its discretion,

17:16.165 --> 17:18.385
which is why we prefer
to handle everything in-house.

17:18.428 --> 17:21.388
Look, I get it.
But I can't help you.

17:21.431 --> 17:24.652
We're seizing everything
inside this house, Mr. Karga,

17:24.695 --> 17:27.959
and if you even attempt to step
foot inside this perimeter,

17:28.003 --> 17:30.136
you'll spend tonight
inside a jail cell.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.574
Wouldn't want to dirty
that nice suit, would you?

17:35.619 --> 17:38.057
And I would love to get
a look at Chester's computer

17:38.100 --> 17:39.667
after TID is done
processing it --

17:39.710 --> 17:41.451
you know, try to get
into his head.

17:41.495 --> 17:42.800
You think Lopez
would let me?

17:42.844 --> 17:44.063
Doesn't hurt to ask.

17:44.106 --> 17:46.456
It's Ash.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.371
Hey, Ash.
Hey.

17:48.415 --> 17:50.243
Olive just pulled out
of the dinner thing,

17:50.286 --> 17:52.854
so now I have
all four tickets.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.291
<i>I was thinking of asking Byron</i> <i>
and his girlfriend...</i>

17:55.335 --> 17:57.337
Yeah, uh, no.

17:57.380 --> 17:59.208
Y-You know what?

17:59.252 --> 18:01.036
Lucy's been pining after
that place all day.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.385
Maybe we ask her.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.605
Osia? Yes. Oh, my gosh.
Yes, please.

18:04.648 --> 18:06.389
<i>Cool. Does she have</i> <i>
a date to bring?</i>

18:07.434 --> 18:09.088
- Hey, Sanford.
- What?

18:09.131 --> 18:10.611
You got plans tonight?

18:10.654 --> 18:12.047
What are you doing?

18:12.091 --> 18:13.701
Lucy needs a date
to a fancy dinner.

18:13.744 --> 18:15.442
Uh...

18:15.485 --> 18:18.184
It'll be fun.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.490
Okay. Yeah.
I'm in.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.710
Uh, text me the address.

18:22.753 --> 18:24.233
She's good.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.234
Okay.

18:27.758 --> 18:29.325
What?

18:29.369 --> 18:30.587
Don't be
such a control freak.

18:30.631 --> 18:33.112
Hey, we gave it
our best shot.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.853
- Tomorrow's another day.
- It always is.

18:35.897 --> 18:39.205
You know, the architecture
in this city is ghastly.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.469
Do not bad-mouth
my city, Romeo.

18:42.512 --> 18:45.211
Oooh. So sensitive.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.647
But I will prove it
- to you.
- Uh...

18:46.690 --> 18:48.083
Come to Rome.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.650
You walk down the streets,

18:49.693 --> 18:51.739
you'll see thousands of years
of history.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.045
That's what a real city
should look like.

18:54.089 --> 18:56.222
I'm serious.
Bring that wife of yours.

18:56.265 --> 19:00.269
Luna has been on me
about traveling more.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.837
Then it's decided.
You will be my guest.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.447
I will open
my doors for you.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.015
That's very generous.
Thank you.

19:09.235 --> 19:12.325
You know, you remind me
of someone I used to know.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.631
A lieutenant.

19:14.675 --> 19:16.155
His name was Santo.

19:17.765 --> 19:20.811
I was only his cadet
when I joined the <i>Carabinieri,</i>

19:20.855 --> 19:22.726
but he took me
under his wings.

19:22.770 --> 19:24.859
He showed me
my city through new eyes.

19:24.902 --> 19:26.817
Like you are now.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.298
"Used to know."

19:29.342 --> 19:30.778
What happened?

19:30.821 --> 19:33.302
My second year,
he, uh --

19:33.346 --> 19:35.217
he was shot.

19:35.261 --> 19:37.611
I was there.

19:37.654 --> 19:39.656
He died in my arms.

19:39.700 --> 19:43.573
Every day, in here...

19:43.617 --> 19:45.096
I see it.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.450
Yeah, I know a little something
about that.

19:50.493 --> 19:54.410
This is a miserable job
sometimes.

19:54.454 --> 19:55.803
That it is.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.982
And sometimes,
the best.

20:02.418 --> 20:04.072
That is true.

20:06.292 --> 20:08.685
What's this?

20:08.729 --> 20:11.427
Ah.
Flex just got word.

20:11.471 --> 20:13.777
Kai's meeting the diamond broker
tonight --

20:13.821 --> 20:16.171
Gardner and Beverly.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.391
That is wonderful.

20:18.434 --> 20:21.002
But I don't want to keep you
from the end of your shift.

20:21.045 --> 20:23.309
Why don't you drop me off?
I'll go stake it out.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.572
If he's there,
I'll call for backup.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.138
See, I can't
let you do that.

20:27.182 --> 20:29.140
Besides, I already told
the station

20:29.184 --> 20:32.143
that I'm extending my shift
tonight, so...

20:32.187 --> 20:34.668
You've already put in so much
time on my case.

20:34.711 --> 20:37.279
Go home to your wife.

20:37.323 --> 20:42.328
You know... Luna has
book club tonight.

20:42.371 --> 20:44.112
I'm all yours.

20:46.114 --> 20:48.290
I told a foodie friend I was
coming here, and they flipped.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.510
And they said it sold out in,
like, 30 seconds.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.076
How the hell
did you get tickets?

20:52.120 --> 20:54.383
My friend won them
in a raffle.

20:54.427 --> 20:57.038
I'm sorry, but who puts
a restaurant on the beach?

20:57.081 --> 20:59.214
I mean, you're just asking for
sand in your food.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.911
I don't get it.

21:00.955 --> 21:03.131
For your first course,
we have Chef Celine Barris' take

21:03.174 --> 21:05.394
on blinis and caviar --

21:05.438 --> 21:08.223
a savory enoki pancake
with fruit of the forest roe,

21:08.267 --> 21:11.182
and smoked Himalayan salt
espuma.

21:11.226 --> 21:12.619
Enjoy.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.754
- Was any of that English?
- Let me translate.

21:17.798 --> 21:19.103
All you need to know

21:19.147 --> 21:20.496
is that that pancake
is made of mushroom,

21:20.540 --> 21:22.019
which I know is not
your favorite, so I'm just --

21:22.063 --> 21:24.631
Ooh, no, take it.
Yeah.
Yeah.

21:24.674 --> 21:26.720
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you don't like mushrooms.

21:26.763 --> 21:28.374
Oh, it's okay.

21:28.417 --> 21:30.550
I'm not the most adventurous
eater, either.

21:30.593 --> 21:32.726
But once on vacation in Jamaica,
I did have curry goat.

21:32.769 --> 21:35.337
Ooh.
Was his name Gerald?

21:35.381 --> 21:38.340
God, shut up.
Don't.

21:38.384 --> 21:39.559
It's nothing.

21:39.602 --> 21:40.734
No, it's something.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.215
Okay, we had
a 2-11 at a petting zoo.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.043
All of the animals
got loose.

21:46.087 --> 21:47.480
So, we --
we nab our suspect,

21:47.523 --> 21:49.090
we him back to the shop,
and that's where we find --

21:49.133 --> 21:51.658
Gerald the goat.
He is so cute.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.573
And he's sitting
in Lucy's seat.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.401
Well, because I forgot
that I had rolled down
the -- the window.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.359
You know,
who knew goats could jump?

21:57.403 --> 21:59.187
Look, she tries to talk
him out of the shop,
but it's a goat, right?

21:59.230 --> 22:01.232
So, she spends five minutes
making goat noises

22:01.276 --> 22:03.322
at this thing.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.628
Yes, he called me
"goat whisperer" for
all of last February.

22:05.672 --> 22:07.717
- It was great.
- The darn thing never moved.

22:07.761 --> 22:10.067
Oh, you know, we finally had
to call animal control.

22:12.461 --> 22:14.507
It's funny.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.816
Thank you so much
for coming, Councilwoman.

22:19.860 --> 22:22.123
Of course.
It is my pleasure.

22:22.166 --> 22:23.864
You know, every time
that I've reached out

22:23.907 --> 22:26.388
to one of my district's
union delegates,

22:26.432 --> 22:28.434
they always brush aside
my invitations to talk.

22:28.477 --> 22:30.653
So imagine my surprise
when you actually seemed excited

22:30.697 --> 22:32.481
to talk to me.
Oh, I am.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.440
No, I-I campaigned
on the promise of change,

22:34.483 --> 22:36.659
and I meant it.

22:36.703 --> 22:39.314
Some of the best people
you could ever meet

22:39.358 --> 22:40.794
are in the LAPD.

22:40.837 --> 22:42.491
I would like the institution
to reflect that.

22:42.535 --> 22:44.101
How can I help?

22:44.145 --> 22:45.494
I'll be honest,
Councilwoman --

22:45.538 --> 22:46.843
- Elena.
- Elena.

22:46.887 --> 22:49.063
Math was never
my strong suit.

22:49.106 --> 22:51.108
My brain bleeds
just looking at my taxes.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.067
But I was going over
our departmental budget,

22:53.110 --> 22:55.635
and even I can see
we're putting a lot of money

22:55.678 --> 22:57.332
in the wrong places.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.899
You won't get an argument
from me.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.249
Now, at least 20%
of our service calls

23:01.292 --> 23:04.208
are for mental health
or substance-use issues.

23:04.252 --> 23:06.602
Now, these people
don't need to be policed.

23:06.646 --> 23:08.343
They need
crisis intervention

23:08.387 --> 23:10.780
and a counselor
dispatched to the scene.

23:10.824 --> 23:12.869
I've been thinking about
a pilot program.

23:12.913 --> 23:14.958
If you could help me get
an audience with the mayor --

23:15.002 --> 23:16.569
I'm so sorry.
This is -- It's my first day.

23:16.612 --> 23:18.745
I'm already overstepping.
No.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.834
Do not apologize.

23:20.877 --> 23:23.532
Your empathy is --
it's genuine. I can tell.

23:23.576 --> 23:25.012
Tell me more
about this program, please.

23:25.055 --> 23:26.361
Alright.

23:26.405 --> 23:28.015
Well, people don't like
the idea of experimenting

23:28.058 --> 23:29.843
on the dead
for emotional reasons,

23:29.886 --> 23:31.845
but it's an important tool
in the medical field.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.934
Yeah,
I'm not arguing that.

23:33.977 --> 23:35.631
All I'm saying is that
turning people into cyborgs

23:35.675 --> 23:37.111
is how the world
is going to end.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.418
So, then, I guess you
haven't volunteered

23:39.461 --> 23:40.767
to be an organ donor
when you die?

23:40.810 --> 23:42.551
Tim? No.

23:42.595 --> 23:45.032
He wants to be cremated
and spread over Dodger Field.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.513
I was joking
when I said that.

23:47.556 --> 23:49.819
My ashes would screw up
the pH level of the grass.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.778
I can't believe you actually
called and asked.

23:51.821 --> 23:55.129
I like the Dodgers.
Yeah.

23:55.172 --> 23:57.000
And for dessert,

23:57.044 --> 23:59.786
we have a spherical
coconut-mango emulsion

23:59.829 --> 24:02.397
with a dusting
of jalapeño essence.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.485
Enjoy.

24:05.269 --> 24:06.880
This is a joke, right?

24:06.923 --> 24:10.274
I mean, people don't actually
enjoy eating this food, do they?

24:12.712 --> 24:14.061
I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to --

24:14.104 --> 24:15.715
Excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

24:17.586 --> 24:18.805
Whoa.

24:20.546 --> 24:22.156
Wade, please.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.071
I feel bad,
making you waste your night

24:24.114 --> 24:26.029
for what's likely
a goose chase.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.640
This is my case.

24:27.683 --> 24:30.512
I'll take the burden
for the both of us.

24:30.556 --> 24:32.732
I'm starting to feel like you're
trying to get rid of me.

24:32.775 --> 24:36.518
No.
I'm loving our time together.

24:36.562 --> 24:40.609
It's just that...it's not good
to work all the time.

24:40.653 --> 24:42.306
You need to
enjoy life more.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.919
That's one thing I've learned
after Santo died.

24:49.444 --> 24:51.620
- There he is.
- I'll call for backup.

24:51.664 --> 24:53.056
Hey!

24:57.800 --> 24:59.889
<i>Preso, bastardo!</i>

25:11.553 --> 25:13.207
7-Adam-100, shots fired.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.165
Officer needs help.

25:15.209 --> 25:18.734
Suspect is white male,
black jacket, black pants.

25:18.778 --> 25:20.736
Hey.
What the hell was that?

25:20.780 --> 25:22.564
He had a gun.
You did not see?

25:22.608 --> 25:24.000
No, I didn't see.

25:24.044 --> 25:26.133
Well, he did.
He's a very dangerous man.

25:26.176 --> 25:27.656
If I'd hesitated,
he would have killed me.

25:36.491 --> 25:38.101
Yeah.

25:38.145 --> 25:39.712
Good morning.

25:39.755 --> 25:41.670
Franklin Crest e-mailed.

25:41.714 --> 25:45.935
Their enrollment is suddenly
full for two years from now.

25:45.979 --> 25:48.155
Okay, I'm sorry,
but if they are that sensitive

25:48.198 --> 25:49.635
to questions about
their students,

25:49.678 --> 25:51.419
then maybe we shouldn't
send Jack there.

25:51.462 --> 25:53.160
We should send him
to public school.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.510
Says the rich boy
who's never been to one.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.599
Well, you went to
public school.

25:57.643 --> 25:59.253
You turned out great.

25:59.296 --> 26:00.602
You're doing it again.

26:00.646 --> 26:02.604
Wait, doing what?

26:02.648 --> 26:04.606
Shoving your privilege
into your back pocket

26:04.650 --> 26:06.869
when you can actually use it
for something good,

26:06.913 --> 26:08.958
like the education
of our child.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.699
- That's not fair.
- But it's accurate.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.660
Look, public school
can be wonderful.

26:14.703 --> 26:17.750
- Then what's the problem?
- You took away our options.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.100
Even if Jack got into
Franklin Crest,

26:20.143 --> 26:23.016
we might not have enrolled him,
but you sabotaged it

26:23.059 --> 26:25.105
and essentially made
a decision without me.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.541
And why did you do it?

26:26.585 --> 26:28.499
Because you have
private school baggage.

26:30.545 --> 26:32.721
Okay. Fine.

26:34.114 --> 26:37.291
Maybe I do have
some...baggage.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.380
Maybe I'm afraid that
our son will become

26:39.423 --> 26:42.775
the same poster boy
for entitlement that I was,

26:42.818 --> 26:46.387
until I realized
I didn't like myself,

26:46.430 --> 26:48.650
and I set out to become
the man that you love.

26:48.694 --> 26:51.348
Mostly.

26:51.392 --> 26:53.568
I'm just disappointed
that you didn't have more faith

26:53.612 --> 26:55.178
in us as parents.

27:01.750 --> 27:04.927
<i>They will record</i> <i>
my name in history.</i>

27:04.971 --> 27:06.712
<i>They will parade me through --</i>

27:06.755 --> 27:09.236
Hey.
You're here early.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.977
Yeah.
I couldn't sleep.

27:11.020 --> 27:13.066
All I could think of
was this disembodied hand

27:13.109 --> 27:15.634
climbing into my bed,
so I've been here,

27:15.677 --> 27:17.810
scrubbing through
Chester's video journals.

27:17.853 --> 27:19.333
You come
to any conclusions?

27:19.376 --> 27:21.465
I try not to use the word
"crazy"...

27:21.509 --> 27:24.164
He cut off a guy's hand and
reanimated a woman's dead arm.

27:24.207 --> 27:26.601
He's crazy.
Yeah.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.256
Okay, so,
he shot this next video

27:29.299 --> 27:31.562
the day before he cut off
Mark Kilkea's hand

27:31.606 --> 27:33.390
and used it
to break into ManMade Labs.

27:35.001 --> 27:38.482
<i>I am here,</i> <i>
trying to officiate a marriage</i>

27:38.526 --> 27:42.661
<i>between science and humanity,</i> <i>
and nothing's working.</i>

27:42.704 --> 27:44.401
<i>I know what I have to do.</i>

27:44.445 --> 27:45.925
<i>I've never wanted</i> <i>
to resort to violence,</i>

27:45.968 --> 27:48.797
<i>but this is not the time</i> <i>
to be faint of heart.</i>

27:48.841 --> 27:52.583
<i>I am so close.</i> <i>

27:54.760 --> 27:56.936

forever.</i>

27:56.979 --> 27:59.982
Okay, so, this next one

28:00.026 --> 28:03.856
is his last video entry,
and it was shot yesterday.

28:03.899 --> 28:06.119
<i>It worked.</i>

28:06.162 --> 28:09.122
<i>Hear that? Hear it?</i> <i>
Hear it?</i>

28:12.995 --> 28:14.649
<i>The wrist is contracting.</i> <i>
The -- The --</i>

28:14.693 --> 28:17.130
<i>The hand is knocking,</i>

28:17.173 --> 28:20.568
<i>pounding on the doors</i> <i>
of immortality!</i>

28:20.611 --> 28:22.483
<i>This changes everything.</i>

28:22.526 --> 28:23.963
<i>Who needs a prosthetic limb</i> <i>
when you can be made whole</i>

28:24.006 --> 28:26.182
<i>with a reanimated one?</i>

28:26.226 --> 28:28.576
<i>I'm creating life.</i>

28:28.619 --> 28:30.317
<i>I am a god.</i>

28:30.360 --> 28:31.622
<i>Whoo--</i>

28:31.666 --> 28:33.015
Anything in these videos
that can lead us

28:33.059 --> 28:34.756
- to where he's hiding?
- Not that I've seen.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.931
Well,
let's keep looking.

28:35.975 --> 28:38.455
- What do you need?
- Close the door.

28:38.499 --> 28:39.935
Come here.

28:39.979 --> 28:41.720
I heard you were involved
in a shooting. You alright?

28:41.763 --> 28:43.547
That was
my Italian counterpart.

28:43.591 --> 28:48.030
He and I tracked down
his fugitive -- Kai Zullo.

28:48.074 --> 28:49.945
But the second
Romeo saw the guy,

28:49.989 --> 28:51.773
he opened fire,
claimed he saw a gun.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.166
- But you didn't.
- Correct.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.515
Did you check
your body cam?

28:54.558 --> 28:56.473
Of course,
but there wasn't a good look.

28:56.517 --> 28:58.127
I phoned Italy
last night.

28:58.171 --> 29:00.086
Spoke to one of
their inspectors.

29:00.129 --> 29:03.089
She told me that Romeo is
currently under investigation

29:03.132 --> 29:04.873
for misconduct.

29:04.917 --> 29:07.223
- So he's a dirty cop?
- Seemingly.

29:07.267 --> 29:10.052
I think it's prudent that
we find Kai before Romeo does.

29:10.096 --> 29:11.793
Okay, so what do we know
about Kai so far?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.795
He's in
a foreign country.

29:13.839 --> 29:15.797
He appears not to have friends
or family here.

29:15.841 --> 29:16.929
He has to stay under
the radar,

29:16.972 --> 29:19.366
so he can't use a credit card
or his ID.

29:19.409 --> 29:21.411
Right, but he is gonna need
a place to stay.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.457
A no-tell motel
that accepts cash.

29:23.500 --> 29:24.980
We will
start canvassing.

29:25.024 --> 29:27.722
Thanks. I'll keep Romeo busy
while you look.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.245
Hey. <i>Implant the size of --</i>

29:29.289 --> 29:31.073
We got hits on prints
on three of the arms

29:31.117 --> 29:32.814
found in Chester's place.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.816
All three were from unclaimed
or indigent people

29:34.860 --> 29:37.384
whose bodies had been in storage
in the County Morgue.

29:37.427 --> 29:39.995
That's a great way to grab
bodies no one would ever miss.

29:40.039 --> 29:42.215
The County holds onto the
remains of unclaimed individuals

29:42.258 --> 29:43.694
for up to three years,

29:43.738 --> 29:45.392
then they're buried
in a pauper's grave.

29:45.435 --> 29:46.872
That's sad.

29:46.915 --> 29:49.396
D-Does Chester have a connection
to the morgue?

29:49.439 --> 29:51.659
Not that we know of,
but it's possible

29:51.702 --> 29:54.053
that he found an
employee who was willing
to sell him body parts.

29:54.096 --> 29:56.490
- We'll check it out.
- Yeah.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.851
Police.
Anyone here?

30:14.116 --> 30:16.031
He's here.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.820
- It's still wet.
- Control, 7-Adam-100.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.473
Can I get backup
for a 415?

30:23.517 --> 30:25.258
Male, unknown weapon.
Standby for further.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.291
He's dead.

30:58.334 --> 31:00.728
7-Adam-100, I have a 187
at the County Morgue.

31:00.771 --> 31:02.164
Suspect is Chester Frey.

31:02.208 --> 31:03.731
Still outstanding
in the building.

31:03.774 --> 31:06.386
Have an RA stand by
until scene is secure.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.663
Everyone, up against the wall.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.622
Go.

31:27.407 --> 31:29.931
Now! Faster!

31:29.975 --> 31:31.672
You -- Shut up.
No.

31:31.715 --> 31:33.152
Shut up!
Help me!

31:33.195 --> 31:36.329
Stop crying!
Stop crying!

31:36.372 --> 31:38.853
Who's the guy in charge?
Raise your hand.

31:38.897 --> 31:40.681
Now!

31:40.724 --> 31:45.033
Okay, no one wants to raise
their hand?

31:45.077 --> 31:48.080
Should I start shooting?

31:48.123 --> 31:49.864
Good.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.475
You, come here.
I need his arm.

31:52.519 --> 31:55.261
That guy there,
on the table.

31:55.304 --> 31:58.568
Stop acting dumb.
You're in charge.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.266
You know how to use
these instruments.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.572
So go ahead.

32:02.616 --> 32:06.228
Pick it up. Start cutting.

32:06.272 --> 32:08.622
Why are you waiting?!

32:08.665 --> 32:10.363
It's either this arm
or your arm!

32:10.406 --> 32:11.581
So pick one!

32:16.499 --> 32:18.937
Anyone moves, I'll blow
their head off. Do you hear me?

32:18.980 --> 32:20.808
It's him.
He's got hostages.

32:20.851 --> 32:24.246
Faster.

32:24.290 --> 32:26.727
- What are our options?
- Faster!

32:26.770 --> 32:28.990
We could wait until
he gets what he wants

32:29.034 --> 32:30.905
and then flank him
on his way out,

32:30.949 --> 32:32.646
but he might kill the hostages
before he leaves.

32:32.689 --> 32:35.518
Which rules that out
as an option.

32:35.562 --> 32:38.608
We could make contact,
bring in a hostage negotiator,

32:38.652 --> 32:40.480
and try to talk him out.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.177
Given the video logs, do you
really think that's an option?

32:42.221 --> 32:44.919
No. Clearly, he thinks
he's on a divine mission.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.182
He'll probably shoot his way out
before he surrenders.

32:47.226 --> 32:50.794
So, what's our game plan?

32:52.231 --> 32:53.319
Now the other one.

33:19.127 --> 33:21.086
7-Adam-100,
show a Code 4.

33:21.129 --> 33:22.435
Suspect in custody.

33:26.439 --> 33:29.181
Okay, I put feelers out
through the union chat group --

33:29.224 --> 33:31.922
a great way to talk to every cop
in L.A., by the way --

33:31.966 --> 33:33.707
and between them all,
they have informants

33:33.750 --> 33:36.579
at 64 of the 71
no-tell motels

33:36.623 --> 33:38.842
in the greater
Los Angeles area.

33:38.886 --> 33:43.021
Of those, one of them has
a possible Kai Zullo sighting.

33:43.064 --> 33:46.850
I say we go get into our civvies
and we stake it out.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.638
God,
I just love this job so much.

33:54.032 --> 33:56.599
- Maybe I should drive.
- Yeah. Okay.

33:56.643 --> 33:57.992
So you mentioned yesterday

33:58.036 --> 34:02.344
that you had
a bit of a history with Kai.

34:02.388 --> 34:04.129
<i>Si, si.</i>

34:04.172 --> 34:05.826
I arrested him
when I first started

34:05.869 --> 34:07.828
with the <i>Polizia Municipale</i> <i>
di Roma,</i>

34:07.871 --> 34:09.830
and many times since.

34:09.873 --> 34:13.007
He's a --
a repeat offender.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.400
Unh-unh. There's something
about this case

34:14.443 --> 34:17.011
you're not telling me.

34:17.055 --> 34:20.362
I don't know, just...
seems personal.

34:20.406 --> 34:22.886
All my cases are personal.

34:22.930 --> 34:24.584
Are yours not?
Hmm.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.631
Excuse me.

34:30.503 --> 34:31.895
Yeah?

34:31.939 --> 34:34.159
It's Nolan.
We got eyes on Kai.

34:34.202 --> 34:36.465
You want us to move in,
make the arrest?

34:36.509 --> 34:37.727
No, I have a better idea.

34:42.036 --> 34:43.385
He's in room 13.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.039
Harper's in
the manager's office,

34:45.083 --> 34:46.040
having the clerk call
all the rooms around,

34:46.084 --> 34:47.476
making sure
no one comes out.

34:47.520 --> 34:48.825
You wanna wait for SWAT?

34:48.869 --> 34:51.219
Yeah.
Like scared little children?

34:51.263 --> 34:54.004
No. Surely, we're men enough
to go arrest him.

34:54.048 --> 34:54.962
It's not about being "men,"
Romeo.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.659
It's about officer safety.

34:56.703 --> 34:59.227
But I do think
we can handle one armed felon.

34:59.271 --> 35:01.186
Somebody's gonna have to post up
in the alley, though,

35:01.229 --> 35:02.230
make sure
he doesn't rabbit.

35:02.274 --> 35:03.971
Allow me.

35:05.320 --> 35:07.105
Okay.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.455
Get in position.
We'll move in when you call.

arrested Kai 20 minutes ago.

36:12.300 --> 36:14.955
He confessed to working with you
back in Italy,

36:14.998 --> 36:18.219
but then he killed a homeowner
and fled to America.

36:18.263 --> 36:21.831
And you worried he would
flip on you if he got caught,

39:50.126 --> 39:53.434
every job I've had has been
wall-to-wall unpredictability.

39:53.478 --> 39:55.784
You know, being ready
for anything,

39:55.828 --> 39:57.438
no matter how crazy
or dangerous.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.005
So, when I'm
off the clock --

39:59.048 --> 40:02.095
You like
your creature comforts.

40:02.138 --> 40:06.360
But life can't just be about
watching Rams games on the couch

40:06.404 --> 40:09.450
and talking about the job
with your partner.

40:09.494 --> 40:12.018
She is not my partner, okay?
I'm her sergeant.

40:12.061 --> 40:15.456
And...that is
not the point.

40:15.500 --> 40:20.287
The point is,
you deserve someone who tries,

40:20.330 --> 40:22.420
and I want to be that
for you.

40:22.463 --> 40:24.683
♪ Push us through the night

40:24.726 --> 40:26.815
♪ I just want to live

40:26.859 --> 40:31.472
I want that, too.

40:31.516 --> 40:32.734
Okay.

40:32.778 --> 40:34.867
So, here's what
I'm thinking.

40:34.910 --> 40:38.871
We get on the freeway,
and we go anywhere,

40:38.914 --> 40:41.221
and you take me to do
anything you want, okay?

40:41.264 --> 40:42.788
I'll even call in sick tomorrow
if you want me to.

40:42.831 --> 40:45.486
- Really?
- Yeah.

40:45.530 --> 40:47.183
♪ Oh, yeah

40:47.227 --> 40:51.666
Uh...and we can do
anything?

40:53.363 --> 40:55.278
Hey.

40:55.322 --> 40:56.628
Nolan.

40:56.671 --> 40:58.978
Lieutenant Briggs.

40:59.021 --> 41:02.895
What did I tell you about not
getting ahead of yourself?

41:02.938 --> 41:04.984
I'm sorry. I don't know
what we're talking about.

41:05.027 --> 41:07.160
I am president
of the police union.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.683
I had no idea
about this.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.642
Do you know how foolish
that makes me look?

41:10.685 --> 41:13.383
I-I swear to you, sir,
that's going to be as good

41:13.427 --> 41:15.037
for us as it is
for the public.

41:15.081 --> 41:17.518
The public? That's not
your job to worry about.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.520
You put your brothers
and sisters first.

41:19.564 --> 41:21.043
That's your job!

41:21.087 --> 41:24.569
Um, respectfully, sir,
I disagree.

41:24.612 --> 41:27.354
You know what the best part
about being union president is?

41:27.397 --> 41:29.443
Power.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.793
The power to help the people
I like

41:31.837 --> 41:34.404
and hurt the people
I don't.

41:34.448 --> 41:37.712
So enjoy your free martinis
and dinners, Officer Nolan.

41:37.756 --> 41:41.020
I've got a feeling you're not
gonna be a delegate for long.

41:41.063 --> 41:43.457
Because I did something
to help the city

41:43.501 --> 41:45.154
a-and cops
sent out on calls

41:45.198 --> 41:46.504
they haven't been properly
trained for?

41:46.547 --> 41:48.114
Come on, sir.

41:48.157 --> 41:49.550
You can't honestly be saying
you'd try to push me

41:49.594 --> 41:50.551
out of office for that?

41:50.595 --> 41:52.379
Watch me.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.642
Yikes.

41:54.686 --> 41:56.557
Really? When I need
Detective Happy Pants the most,

41:56.601 --> 41:57.906
I get "yikes"?

41:57.950 --> 41:59.560
Oh, you don't
need me for that.

41:59.604 --> 42:03.695
You are the most positive person
I have ever met.

42:03.738 --> 42:06.088
You certainly are not gonna let
a guy like Briggs

42:06.132 --> 42:08.438
get in your way.

42:08.482 --> 42:09.918
- You know, you're right.
- Mm-hmm.

42:09.962 --> 42:11.354
No matter
what happens next,

42:11.398 --> 42:13.661
I said I was gonna bring change
to the Department,

42:13.705 --> 42:15.663
and I'm doing that.
