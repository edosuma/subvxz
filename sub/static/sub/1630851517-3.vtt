Young Sheldon...</i>

00:03.612 --> 00:05.005
Did we talk about going home
from the bar together? Sure.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.093
But nothing actually happened.

00:06.136 --> 00:08.008
Kind of feels like it.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.835
It does feel like it.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.489
Why does it feel like it?

00:11.533 --> 00:13.491
Hi, Mary.
Hey, John.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.058
What are you doing here?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.494
Well, I lost my job,

00:16.538 --> 00:20.020
so, while I'm figuring things
out, I'm a bag boy.

00:20.063 --> 00:23.023
Aren't you
a little overqualified?

00:23.066 --> 00:24.024
[whispers]:
Very.

00:24.067 --> 00:25.634
You've got a PhD.

00:25.677 --> 00:27.288
You're the smartest person here.

00:27.331 --> 00:27.984
Well...

00:32.075 --> 00:33.294
ADULT SHELDON: <i>
In physics,</i>

00:33.337 --> 00:36.384
<i>potential energy is
a fascinating topic. </i>

00:36.427 --> 00:40.083
<i>Objects like springs store
energy when they're coiled, </i>

00:40.127 --> 00:42.129

00:48.874 --> 00:52.356
<i>Even in toy form,
I'm shooting for the stars. </i>

00:53.357 --> 00:55.881
<i>While the potential energy
of an object </i>

00:55.925 --> 00:57.144
<i>can be measured in absolutes,</i>

00:57.187 --> 00:59.885
<i>human potential
remains more elusive. </i>

01:01.887 --> 01:05.891
<i>Sometimes, people seem to have
all the potential in the world, </i>

01:05.935 --> 01:08.894
<i>but for some reason
stay stuck to the ground. </i>

01:10.766 --> 01:12.724
But why are you wasting
your time here

01:12.768 --> 01:14.204
when you could be
doing science?

01:14.248 --> 01:17.077
I told you, I'm happy here.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.079
How could you be happy?

01:19.122 --> 01:20.906
You have a doctorate in physics,
and you're sticking labels

01:20.950 --> 01:22.169
to a case of beans.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.561
I had to work here
a month

01:23.605 --> 01:25.563
before they let me use
this thing.

01:25.607 --> 01:29.480
And yet, I could go buy
a real gun on my lunch break.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.917
Ha! Texas, huh?

01:31.961 --> 01:34.224
But don't you miss

01:34.268 --> 01:36.139

01:36.183 --> 01:39.142
Sheldon, I spent my life
chasing theoreticals.

01:39.186 --> 01:42.537
Here, I have
tangible accomplishments

01:42.580 --> 01:46.062
and I get to listen to relaxing
Top 40 music.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.630
Do you know this band,

you and Darlene do when,

02:23.317 --> 02:26.146
- you know, you go out on a date?
- Oh.

02:26.189 --> 02:27.277
All kinds of stuff.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.322
But it doesn't matter
what we do

02:28.365 --> 02:30.106
as long as we're together.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.499
Looking for a thing to do here.

02:31.542 --> 02:32.978
All right.

02:33.022 --> 02:35.329
Nice to see you're thinking
about your wife.

02:35.372 --> 02:37.026
I'm trying.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.246
Darlene and I love
to go line dancing.

02:39.289 --> 02:41.117
- Next.
- Let's see.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.163
There's the Roundabout.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.468
What's that?

02:44.512 --> 02:45.556
It's a roller rink.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.168
They have cool lights and a DJ.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.473
It's like a disco.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.214
So, when I said no
to line dancing,

02:51.258 --> 02:53.042
you thought,
"Let's put George on wheels."

02:53.085 --> 02:54.043
Ooh.

bowling.
Fine.

But it doesn't matter
where you go.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.531
She's just gonna be happy
you're trying.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.663
I hope so.

Don't patronize me.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.901
It's called Canada.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.731
You're early.

03:29.774 --> 03:31.559

don't care what "X" is.

- That's my problem.
- Mind if I change?

03:41.569 --> 03:43.440
Yeah, please, go right ahead.

03:43.484 --> 03:45.747
Why else would I have

Hated it.

I quit and I joined the Army.

Less girls,

Well, at least you made it out
alive.

04:00.849 --> 04:02.503
Well, then I gotmarried.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.592
Made me kind of
miss getting shot at.

04:26.527 --> 04:27.963
Well, I was waiting outside,

04:28.006 --> 04:29.921
but then an angry squirrel
forced me to seek shelter.

04:29.965 --> 04:31.662
What do you want?

04:31.706 --> 04:33.447
I need you to talk
to Dr. Sturgis.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.753
He's wasting his time
working in a grocery store.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.799
- Oh, then the rumor is true?
- Yes.

04:37.842 --> 04:40.410
Good, I spread it heavily
at the faculty mixer.

04:40.454 --> 04:42.630
Well, please.

04:42.673 --> 04:43.979
He won't listen to me.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.937
I'm hoping you can talk
some sense into him.

04:45.981 --> 04:47.765
Sheldon, he's a grown man.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.811
Perhaps in a little apron
with a nametag--

04:49.854 --> 04:50.942
is how I'm picturing it.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.944
- That's exactly right.
- Excellent.

04:52.988 --> 04:54.598
So, will you talk to him?

04:54.642 --> 04:56.296
Look, if he doesn't want to
come back,

04:56.339 --> 04:57.645
I certainly can't force him.

04:57.688 --> 04:59.647
But he's wasting his potential.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.649
[sighs]

05:01.692 --> 05:03.520
I'm just curious,
if he were to come back,

05:03.564 --> 05:04.956
would you spend
more time with him,

05:05.000 --> 05:06.697
and therefore less time with me?

05:06.741 --> 05:08.308
I suppose so. Why?

05:08.351 --> 05:09.831
No reason. Get out.

05:12.921 --> 05:14.836
[chuckles] John.

05:14.879 --> 05:18.361
Hello, Grant.
What brings you here?

05:18.405 --> 05:20.624
Well, I'm here to convince you
to come back to the university.

05:20.668 --> 05:22.322
A mind like yours
needs to be working

05:22.365 --> 05:23.584
on the advancement of science.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.977
Well, I did that for 50 years.

05:26.021 --> 05:29.981
Now I'm content just keeping
these cucumbers crunchy.

05:30.025 --> 05:31.983
But exciting new things
are happening in string theory.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.681
Don't you want to be
a part of that?

05:33.724 --> 05:38.425
Wasting years scrambling away
at the academic hamster wheel?

05:38.468 --> 05:40.383
Constantly worried

05:40.427 --> 05:43.473
that your life's work is just
one big dead end?

05:44.474 --> 05:46.824
Sure, some paths of research
may not pan out,

05:46.868 --> 05:48.739
but we still have to try, right?

05:48.783 --> 05:50.393
Do we?

05:50.437 --> 05:52.569
- Of course.
- I don't know.

05:52.613 --> 05:55.485
Einstein spent
the last 30 years of his life

05:55.529 --> 05:58.706
on the grand unified field
theory and got nowhere.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.665
Well, I wouldn't say nowhere,

06:01.709 --> 06:04.494
but I suppose
he never did crack it.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.017
And to this day, no one has.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.455
- True.
- In fact,

06:08.498 --> 06:10.413
most of his major
accomplishments occurred

06:10.457 --> 06:11.719
when he was a young man,

06:11.762 --> 06:14.635
which you and I
most certainly are not.

06:16.114 --> 06:19.422
Sometimes I look in the mirror
and I think, "Who is that?"

06:21.468 --> 06:24.819
Would you like to give
these cucumbers a spritz?

06:24.862 --> 06:26.908
No, thank you.

Level with me, son.

he looks up to you.

09:01.497 --> 09:02.629
He does, doesn't he?

09:02.672 --> 09:03.804
Which is why
you need to tell him

09:03.847 --> 09:06.067
that he is making a big mistake.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.417
Oh, I don't think I can do that.

09:08.460 --> 09:09.418
Why not?

09:09.461 --> 09:11.638
Well, I don't believe he is.

09:11.681 --> 09:14.075
How could you say that?

09:14.118 --> 09:16.077
I did it,
worked out fine.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.775
Will you back me up here,
please?

09:18.819 --> 09:20.951
I agree with him.

and baseball bats?

09:38.534 --> 09:40.536
Excuse me,

Ooh. Perhaps this is a good time
for a physics joke.

That's the cool thing
about physics, time is relative.

10:11.001 --> 10:12.655
Okay, here we go.

10:12.699 --> 10:15.832
Why was the pirate worried that
his shoes were less than "H"?

10:17.529 --> 10:19.619
Because he had to walk
the Planck.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.970
Get it?
Because Max Planck is

10:23.013 --> 10:24.841
a famous physicist
who discovered a constant

10:24.885 --> 10:26.669
which is represented by "H."
And then he...

10:26.713 --> 10:28.976
If Georgie's kicked out,
can I have his room?

10:29.019 --> 10:30.499
We are not kicking Georgie out.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.935
You want to start this up again?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.720
Or can we just be mad
at your mom and Dale?

10:33.763 --> 10:35.678
And Georgie.
Thank you.
And Georgie.

10:35.722 --> 10:36.679
Let's just eat.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.989
So can anyone drop out or do
you need to be a certain age?

10:42.032 --> 10:43.730
You are not dropping
out of school.

10:43.773 --> 10:46.515

they legally can't stop you.

10:46.558 --> 10:47.516
Good to know.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.259
What do you want me
to do about it?

11:36.739 --> 11:38.262
No!

My father already doesn't think
you're good enough for me.

And I don't want him
to know he's right.

11:41.831 --> 11:43.050
He's not right!

11:43.093 --> 11:44.921
He might be a little right.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.707

And don't ask for cookies.

17:28.308 --> 17:30.092
She is in no mood.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.746
Well...

17:31.789 --> 17:34.183
You know who's at my place?

17:34.227 --> 17:36.229
No one.

17:36.272 --> 17:39.536
I think I should stay here
and keep an eye on these two.

17:39.580 --> 17:41.625
It wasn't an invite.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.193
Just something I was
looking forward to.

17:44.237 --> 17:46.369
Later.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.589
Bye.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.460
Did he get a haircut?

17:50.504 --> 17:52.158
It looks really nice.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.817
So how come you're
here tonight?

17:59.861 --> 18:01.297
Were you too drunk

18:01.341 --> 18:02.820
to ride your bike home, too?

18:02.864 --> 18:05.475
My father's mad
'cause I dropped out of school.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.347
[chuckles]
Ironic.

18:07.390 --> 18:09.175
Sheldon's upset

18:09.218 --> 18:11.568
'cause I'm not going
back to the university.

18:11.612 --> 18:12.787
Look at us.

18:12.830 --> 18:15.137
A couple of dropouts.

18:15.181 --> 18:17.139
Don't you have a PhD?

18:17.183 --> 18:20.142
Two, but I was
trying to find

18:20.186 --> 18:21.622
common ground

18:21.665 --> 18:24.146
over which we could bond.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.409
All right.

18:28.846 --> 18:31.545
You wouldn't believe
the day I had.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.764
My dad kicked me out.

18:33.808 --> 18:35.505
My girlfriend broke up
with me.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.290
And now I got
to find a second job.

18:37.333 --> 18:39.466
I drank hooch
on a park bench

18:39.509 --> 18:41.468
and sang "Lollipop."

18:41.511 --> 18:43.513
It was tremendous.

18:43.557 --> 18:45.385
I think I saw you.

18:45.428 --> 18:47.256
Were you
with some other guy?

18:47.300 --> 18:48.518
Yes.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.259
What happened to him?

18:50.303 --> 18:52.653
[siren wails]

18:52.696 --> 18:55.438
OFFICER:
Hey, pal, wake up.

18:55.482 --> 18:56.526
[indistinct radio chatter]

18:56.570 --> 18:57.832
What's happening?

18:57.875 --> 18:59.964
You can't sleep there.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.184
Right, sorry.

19:06.232 --> 19:08.756
Excuse me.

19:08.799 --> 19:11.672
You didn't happen to see a small
bald man around here, did you?

19:11.715 --> 19:13.848
Possibly singing "Lollipop"?

19:13.891 --> 19:15.458
What?

19:15.502 --> 19:16.677
♪ Lollipop, lollipop...

19:16.720 --> 19:18.548
Never mind.

19:18.592 --> 19:22.596
♪ Lollipop, lollipop,
oh, lolli, lolli, lollipop... ♪

19:23.771 --> 19:25.773
Where the hell am I?
