[sighs]

02:39.800 --> 02:41.800
Having one of your dreams?

02:42.920 --> 02:44.920
The ones where you can't have a baby.

02:46.680 --> 02:48.420
No, I wasn't.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.340
Dad says that's why
you cry in the night.

02:50.440 --> 02:51.420
I wasn't crying.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.860
-Yes, you were.
-No, I wasn't.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.440
I don't think happy dreams
make that kind of mess.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
[Lloyd] Good morning, poppet.

03:00.880 --> 03:02.500
Right, now --

03:02.600 --> 03:05.300
would madam like her
injection before or after her tea?

03:05.400 --> 03:06.620
[Eadie] Oh, before.

03:06.720 --> 03:08.720
Hello? Hello?

03:09.240 --> 03:11.780
Hello?
Is this thing on? Hello?

03:11.880 --> 03:12.940
[laughs]

03:13.040 --> 03:15.040
I don't think it works
like that, like a phone.

03:16.440 --> 03:18.880
What can I tell you
about day 29, then?

03:20.480 --> 03:22.780
Your mother's more beautiful
than day 28?

03:22.880 --> 03:24.100
[laughs]

03:24.200 --> 03:26.440
-Despite these panda eyes.
-Mmm.

03:27.440 --> 03:30.260
And you survived your first
Category Five wind storm last night.

03:30.360 --> 03:32.360
You slept through all the excitement.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.120
[sighs]

03:36.360 --> 03:38.340
How, after two years,
are you getting worse at this?

03:38.440 --> 03:40.220
I know, I know.
It's a gift, right?

03:40.320 --> 03:41.300
I'm sorry.

03:41.400 --> 03:42.460
You'd better get all Velcro, OK,

03:42.560 --> 03:45.820
because, uh, Mum can't take
any more of my needlework.

03:45.920 --> 03:47.540
OK?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.640
[phone notification]

04:09.000 --> 04:11.240

04:58.600 --> 05:00.600
Greetings and salutations.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.380
Sorry, maybe I'm still dreaming,

05:03.480 --> 05:05.060
but I swear I thought

05:05.160 --> 05:06.580
I just saw Shay

05:06.680 --> 05:08.260
come into our house
using his own key.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.340
But that's impossible,

05:09.440 --> 05:10.420
because you'd never
give him a key.

05:10.520 --> 05:13.140
That is something
I would definitely never do.

05:13.240 --> 05:14.900
And if I did, it would've been
for an incredibly good reason.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.420
There's no reason in the universe
good enough for him to have a key.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.720
And if I don't get it back
by the end of the day,

05:20.480 --> 05:22.180
you'd better lawyer up,
because we'll be getting divorced.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.500
[Shay] I just want everyone
to really, to hear that -

05:24.600 --> 05:27.380
if Eadie doesn't get the key back
by the end of the day,

05:27.480 --> 05:28.940
she's going to divorce Lloyd.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.020
Could it really be that easy?

05:30.120 --> 05:31.340
I've been thinking
of bumping him off

05:31.440 --> 05:32.420
so I can have you
all to myself,

05:32.520 --> 05:35.200
but, you know,
divorce would be a lot tidier.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.840
Still want the key back.

05:40.480 --> 05:42.480
You didn't just do that.

05:43.040 --> 05:45.220
So is the end of the day sundown

05:45.320 --> 05:47.500
or close of business?
-OK, baby.

05:47.600 --> 05:48.980
I love you.
-Love you. Bye.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.740
OK, baby, I love you.

05:50.840 --> 05:53.260
-Have a good day.
-What is on your face?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.780
Don't do one for me.
I'm home again today.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.900
[Eadie] Oh, no,
no, no, no, no.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.900
Rain acidity
is in the top level.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.620
Yes, but it's not
going to rain today.

06:01.880 --> 06:03.260

-I read the e-mail,

06:03.360 --> 06:04.660

06:04.760 --> 06:06.500
-It's near enough.
-And yet so far

06:06.600 --> 06:07.900
school says ten.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.300
Who are we to argue?

Take it. Turn. Walk. Go.

06:13.200 --> 06:15.560
[chainsaw whirring]

06:17.680 --> 06:18.900
[Ivy] I said
it was going to rain.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.260
I'm sure I said that.

06:56.800 --> 06:59.260
Argh! Aw, my eye! Ah!

06:59.360 --> 07:01.220
-Ivy...
-Ivy! What happened?

07:01.320 --> 07:03.820
What happened? Show me.
Show me. Sweetie, show me.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
Ivy, show me your eye.
-Ow!

07:06.360 --> 07:07.740
Hey, not having
the best of starts...

07:07.840 --> 07:09.820
Because you made me
get acid rain in my eye!

07:09.920 --> 07:11.020
Born for the stage.

07:11.120 --> 07:12.260
Ivy, sweetie,

07:12.360 --> 07:14.360
let's take a peak
at that eye, shall we?

07:15.120 --> 07:17.640
Oh, God. I might just run her
by the school nurse.

07:18.280 --> 07:19.940
-I want to go to Mum's!
-Aw.

07:20.040 --> 07:22.180
Come on, let's go
and get you fixed up.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.860
Let's put this on.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.500
Ivy's hurt her eye.

07:25.600 --> 07:27.220
[friends] Ivy!

07:46.080 --> 07:48.420
[Eadie] I really thought
she was just being a bit dramatic,

07:48.520 --> 07:50.180
but there you go.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.280
Stepmonster status confirmed.

07:52.960 --> 07:56.880
Anyway, call me when you can.
Alright. Love you. Bye.

07:57.480 --> 07:58.660
Hey.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.620
Turn around and run.

08:00.720 --> 08:01.700
That bad?

08:01.800 --> 08:03.140
Storm injuries up to the eyeballs.

08:03.240 --> 08:06.180
But if you won't be told,
I need a neurological consult.

08:06.280 --> 08:08.280
So what have you got?

08:10.920 --> 08:13.460
Hey, Ben. This is Dr. Boulay,

08:13.560 --> 08:15.220
the neuropsychologist
I mentioned.

08:15.320 --> 08:17.320
Hey. Eadie.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.780
It looks like
they've done a good job

08:19.880 --> 08:21.880
with the brown paper
and string.

08:23.880 --> 08:28.180
So, Ben, you work
out on the Richmond border

08:28.280 --> 08:30.580
implementing
the new residency measures?

08:30.680 --> 08:31.740
[Ben] Yeah.
Every time there's a big

08:31.840 --> 08:34.020
weather event,
we get smashed with people

08:34.120 --> 08:36.960
trying to come in
who don't have permits yet.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.800
Saw it on the news.
Looked like a shocker.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.060
[tense music]

08:42.160 --> 08:44.280
Yeah, 3000 arrivals a day.

08:45.920 --> 08:49.340
[cars honking]

08:49.440 --> 08:51.660
[Ben] Traffic backed up for miles...

08:51.760 --> 08:53.540
[man over loudspeaker]
Please remain inside your vehicle.

08:53.640 --> 08:56.260
[Ben] Farmers walking off their land,

08:56.360 --> 08:58.500
people leaving towns
that can't be supplied.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.260
[man over loudspeaker]
Have your D9 city permit ready...

09:00.360 --> 09:02.420
Everyone wants to move in closer.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.740
[man] Can I just speak to the border...

09:03.840 --> 09:06.120
[Eadie] And something happened
with one of the cars you stopped?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.980
Yeah, a guy from out west,

09:09.080 --> 09:11.080
he didn't have a permit.

09:11.640 --> 09:12.860
And I'm giving him the spiel -

09:12.960 --> 09:14.020
he's a visitor,

09:14.120 --> 09:15.820
he needs to pay
for a visitor's permit.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.820
If he wants to move in,

09:18.920 --> 09:22.600
he has to get
a residency permit, et cetera.

09:25.040 --> 09:26.580
How does he respond?

09:26.680 --> 09:27.900
I'm not moving my truck!
I got the address...

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
Oh, he's pretty agro.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.100
He's banging on about
why he can't just move in

09:33.200 --> 09:35.440
with his friend
who lives in the inner-west.

09:36.440 --> 09:38.220
Happens all the time.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.140
Um, I'm trying to calm him down...

09:42.240 --> 09:43.780
[Ben] That's fine, if you need to...

09:43.880 --> 09:45.900
No-one's saying
he can't move in eventually,

09:46.000 --> 09:48.020
it's just about slowing down

09:48.120 --> 09:51.480
the number of people coming in,
until the infrastructure can cope.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.700
[Eadie] He's gotta get in the queue?

09:55.800 --> 09:57.800
[Ben] You got a different solution?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.900
What happens next?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.980
Um...

10:03.080 --> 10:05.380
[indistinct arguing]

10:05.480 --> 10:07.960
I point him to the holding bay.

10:10.840 --> 10:12.840
[Eadie] What does he do?

10:13.720 --> 10:15.720
[tense music]

10:16.440 --> 10:18.220
So you point him to the holding bay...

10:18.320 --> 10:19.580
Um, he...

10:19.680 --> 10:21.900
[deep breath] I point him
to the holding bay.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.380
I told him to get out of the car.
He won't get out of the car.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.480
[exhales]

10:27.840 --> 10:29.840
And then he's, uh...

10:30.320 --> 10:32.320
He's reaching.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.880
[exhales]
-[Eadie] And then what?

10:36.400 --> 10:38.400
Ben?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.520
Can you try and tell me what's happening?

10:51.320 --> 10:54.060
I'm not sure
if Salinda explained much

10:54.160 --> 10:56.160
about the treatment I use.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.600
Every time we remember something,

10:59.440 --> 11:00.420
we deepen the bond

11:00.520 --> 11:03.160
between what happened
and the emotion we felt.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.880
There's a window here
to interrupt that process.

11:08.480 --> 11:10.780
It won't erase the memory.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.300
You won't forget what happened.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.780
But the emotion you feel

11:14.880 --> 11:15.900
can be reduced--
-Third

11:16.000 --> 11:18.060
in the convoy.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.260
Third truck.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.360
What's the third truck in the convoy?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.200
Would you like some pants?

11:31.400 --> 11:32.900
[gunshot]

11:33.000 --> 11:34.460
[deafening white noise]

11:34.560 --> 11:37.160
Look at me, look at me. OK.

11:38.360 --> 11:40.360
I'm sorry to do that.

11:44.880 --> 11:46.140
Lots of veterans get work

11:46.240 --> 11:48.240
on the border patrols, don't they?

11:48.640 --> 11:50.700
Yeah.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.800
Yeah, they do.

11:53.320 --> 11:54.300
-[sighs]
-[Salinda] OK,

11:54.400 --> 11:55.460
so for the removal of doubt,

11:55.560 --> 11:57.140
if something horrible
ever happens to me,

11:57.240 --> 11:58.340
you are not invited.

11:58.440 --> 12:00.580
I'm not coming, even if you beg me.

12:00.680 --> 12:03.300
There was no startle assessment
done on admission. I had to.

12:03.400 --> 12:05.900
And yet, you haven't taken him
right up here to neuro.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.540
I want to know
what's in the third truck.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.340
Could you hold onto him
while I do some background?

12:10.440 --> 12:12.340
[Salinda] Sure - I mean,
as long as he doesn't mind spooning

12:12.440 --> 12:14.340
with one of the 50 people
waiting for a bed.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.260
This is not for you,
it's for the baby.

12:17.360 --> 12:19.760
[Salinda] Oh, my God.
It's a steak.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.500
My gestation stats go to Lloyd.

12:22.600 --> 12:24.100
I was low on iron last week.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.980
Alright, hold still.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.380
Got any symptoms besides

12:27.480 --> 12:29.260
eating like a savage?

12:29.360 --> 12:31.360
Just the dreams.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.920
As the clock ticks down,
they're getting worse.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.420
'Cause I know,
if this pregnancy doesn't work,

12:39.520 --> 12:41.860
on Thursday, instead of
the florist sending me

12:41.960 --> 12:44.220
a bunch of flowers
for my birthday,

12:44.320 --> 12:45.700
I'm going to get an e-mail

12:45.800 --> 12:48.900
saying that unless we come up with
a catastrophic amount of money,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.080
my IVF journey is done.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.920
I could sell an organ?

12:54.920 --> 12:57.600
I'd propose to you if I wasn't
so committed to penises.

13:00.120 --> 13:01.540
That's disturbing.

13:01.640 --> 13:02.900
I'm going to go back to work

13:03.000 --> 13:05.540
and pretend
that never happened, OK?

13:05.640 --> 13:07.340
Thanks.

13:07.440 --> 13:08.420
Hey.

13:08.520 --> 13:12.980
It's me. I haven't got time
to go through the proper channels.

13:13.080 --> 13:15.220
I wondered if you could
pull a string or two

13:15.320 --> 13:16.820
and try and get me
a military history

13:16.920 --> 13:22.200
on a Benjamin C-H-I-L-D-E-R-S.

13:22.800 --> 13:26.300
Thanks. I owe you. More.

13:26.400 --> 13:28.400
[chirpy piano and cello music]

13:33.560 --> 13:35.560
[heartbeat]

14:01.400 --> 14:03.580
[loud beep]

14:03.680 --> 14:05.680
[knocking]

14:10.840 --> 14:13.660
I've had a thought - let's just include
a pre-emptive third warning

14:13.760 --> 14:16.140
at your performance review
and call it a day, shall we?

14:16.240 --> 14:19.160
That's up to you, Herm,
I'm just trying to make it easy for you.

14:20.040 --> 14:22.660
I've commandeered you
a couple of field volunteers.

14:22.760 --> 14:24.420
They're just here to help.

14:24.520 --> 14:25.700
Lloyd Green, Shay Levine,

14:25.800 --> 14:27.900
leading the charge
against Chagas disease.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.000
I'll let them catch you up.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.740
Great. OK. Well, I'm about
to go feed the beasts.

14:33.840 --> 14:35.840
Better come and meet 'em.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.460
[Lloyd] So, Chagas disease.
20 million infected.

14:40.560 --> 14:42.820
Ten percent die in the first week.

14:42.920 --> 14:46.780
It attacks the liver, the spleen,
then the eye, ultimately the heart.

14:46.880 --> 14:50.060
Spread by a parasite
that's found in these little babies -

14:50.160 --> 14:53.420
triatominae, commonly known
as the Kissing Bug.

14:53.520 --> 14:55.520
They creep out in the middle of the night

14:56.120 --> 14:58.260
and they very gently bite you on the face.

14:58.360 --> 14:59.380
They take a blood feed

14:59.480 --> 15:02.660
and because they have
no manners whatsoever,

15:02.760 --> 15:04.980
they take a dump on you
before they leave.

15:05.080 --> 15:10.260
The parasite which carries the disease
is found in their faeces.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.820
That enters our bloodstream
when we scratch the bite.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.780
It used to only be found
in the equatorial regions

15:15.880 --> 15:18.060
but now, as the weather hots up,

15:18.160 --> 15:20.160
they're on our doorstep.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.400
Time to saddle up the ponies.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.560
Let's go.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.520
[loud insect chirping]

16:08.600 --> 16:09.780
[Lloyd] Herm emailed this morning

16:09.880 --> 16:13.740
telling us they're re-assessing
all the projects for peer review.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.620
They want whatever we've got
by the end of the day.

16:15.720 --> 16:19.540
Well, that should be easy.
How long does it take to collate sweet FA?

16:19.640 --> 16:22.020
He tells me Wilson's team
is going gangbusters.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.260
Of course they are,

16:23.360 --> 16:25.700
with their army of researchers
and their extra funding

16:25.800 --> 16:27.460
from their special friends
in the private sector,

16:27.560 --> 16:29.220
as opposed to us, with 25 cents

16:29.320 --> 16:32.360
and a well-intentioned gang
of goody two-shoes...

16:33.360 --> 16:34.980
Speaking of which...

16:35.080 --> 16:36.340
[zipper noise]
Seems one of our

16:36.440 --> 16:38.460
dedicated volunteers
looks like she could use

16:38.560 --> 16:41.400
a little one-on-one guidance.

16:42.200 --> 16:44.580
Hey. Hey. Citizen, scientist

16:44.680 --> 16:46.780
and supermodel.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.880
How does that work?

16:49.240 --> 16:52.980
[Corrine] Not by accident.
Double degree in molecular biology...

16:53.080 --> 16:54.380
-[Shay] Yet here you are...

16:54.480 --> 16:56.500

Can't resist the call of the wild.

17:01.040 --> 17:02.740
Hey, there.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.180
Wait - no, no,

17:04.280 --> 17:06.140
don't, don't run. Don't - oi!

17:25.920 --> 17:27.920
[panting]

17:41.120 --> 17:43.860
I'm not from the police, OK?
I'm a scientist.

17:43.960 --> 17:45.900

17:49.520 --> 17:51.660
I'm trying to stop the bug

17:51.760 --> 17:55.460
that causes that disease.
The Chagas disease. Can you-

17:55.560 --> 17:57.560
[Shay] [speaks Vietnamese]

17:58.360 --> 18:00.820
I spent a lot of time here
when my parents split.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.300
Right.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.400
[Shay] [speaks Vietnamese]

18:11.240 --> 18:15.380
Lloyd.
I want to speak to the boy...

18:15.480 --> 18:18.320
-[speaks Vietnamese]
-Thank you.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.260

18:23.360 --> 18:25.500
[mother] My boy, Sang...

18:25.600 --> 18:27.740

18:27.840 --> 18:29.060
OK, Sang speaks a bit of English.

18:29.160 --> 18:30.340
Speak to Sang.
-Sang.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.260
Hey. Hey.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.220
This. How long ago

18:34.320 --> 18:35.540
did you get bitten?

18:35.640 --> 18:36.660
Last year.

18:36.760 --> 18:39.960
OK, and what about your grandmother?
When was she bitten?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.060
How long ago?

18:43.160 --> 18:45.200
[translates in Vietnamese]

18:46.400 --> 18:47.860
-[speaks Vietnamese] -[Shay]
A long time ago.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.960
[Lloyd] OK.

18:51.280 --> 18:53.280
Have you been tested?

18:53.880 --> 18:55.180
Has she been tested?

18:55.280 --> 18:56.260
-No.
-No?

18:56.360 --> 18:58.340
OK. You must go to the hospital

18:58.440 --> 19:01.580
and get a test.
If you have Chagas,

19:01.680 --> 19:03.660
it can go to the child. OK?

19:03.760 --> 19:04.860
Sang, can you tell her?

19:04.960 --> 19:07.360
[exchange in Vietnamese]

-[Shay] OK...

19:10.400 --> 19:12.660
[speaks in Vietnamese]

19:12.760 --> 19:15.740
She doesn't want to go to hospital.
They don't have city permits.

19:15.840 --> 19:19.100
She's scared they'll send her back.
She's right, man.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.500
She's right.
-Hey, it's OK.

19:20.600 --> 19:24.340
Sang, I want you to make sure
all the bugs are gone,

19:24.440 --> 19:26.780
-OK? You need to shut the windows.
-[Shae] Lloyd...

19:26.880 --> 19:28.140
-And shut the doors, OK?
-[Shae] Lloyd...

19:28.240 --> 19:29.260
You've got to keep the bugs out.

19:29.360 --> 19:31.380
And the bed, you gotta...
-[Sang] What's wrong with the beds?

19:31.480 --> 19:33.100
-Just check the beds.

19:33.200 --> 19:34.580
[mother] [speaking Vietnamese]

19:34.680 --> 19:37.360
-We have to burn the beds, OK?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.200
We have to burn the bed. Come on.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
[Shay] Good.

20:07.080 --> 20:12.120
[violin music]

20:16.800 --> 20:19.560
Right, time to get out
and about, I reckon.

20:20.240 --> 20:22.240
Come on, then. In you get.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.220
You're quite bossy, aren't you?

20:24.320 --> 20:26.760
It has been said before
but only by Libras.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.820
So, I'm seeing a lot of the classic--

20:29.920 --> 20:31.920
Oh, sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.940
Classic PTSD symptoms.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.340
-Thanks.
-Are you one of those people

20:36.440 --> 20:38.100

-No.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.200
Good.

[peaceful music]

20:44.040 --> 20:46.560
[birds chirping]

20:54.720 --> 20:58.560
I've seen more healing happen here
than anywhere else in this place.

21:09.240 --> 21:13.260
I'm guessing there are a bunch
of other symptoms

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
you've been dragging around
with you for years, too.

21:17.640 --> 21:23.360
Nightmares, rage, substance abuse.
Stop me if I'm wrong.

21:26.160 --> 21:31.260
I think what happened at the tollgates
was triggered by an earlier trauma,

21:31.360 --> 21:33.360
by something that happened on tour.

21:37.600 --> 21:42.480
What you need to know is,
I can't guarantee the therapy will work.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.820
It depends on how willing you are

21:45.920 --> 21:48.480
to walk right up
to the trauma of what's happened.

21:50.560 --> 21:54.700
If you only bring ten percent,
the therapy can only work on ten percent.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.100
[running water]

21:56.200 --> 21:57.820
If you want to be free of it,

21:57.920 --> 22:01.560
you need to leap into the abyss
and stand toe to toe with the demons.

22:05.400 --> 22:07.520
-And if I can't?
-Then...

22:08.600 --> 22:11.060
I have to write a report
to the department saying that,

22:11.160 --> 22:14.920
in my professional opinion,
you are unfit to work with weapons.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.360
When do I have to decide?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.960
Wish I could say
as long as you need, but...

22:23.480 --> 22:26.380
Unless you're booked in for treatment
by the end of the day,

22:26.480 --> 22:28.480
people will be screaming for your bed.

22:28.920 --> 22:30.920
It won't be pretty.

-His sister. He's expecting me.

-Hi.

Sorry to drag you
away from work.

26:50.560 --> 26:52.660
The school couldn't get
a hold of you or Lloyd, so...

26:52.760 --> 26:54.940
-Yeah, sorry.
-It's fine, it's fine. Chesca was happy

26:55.040 --> 26:56.940
to get her. It's just, we had
an incident here last week

26:57.040 --> 26:58.340
and they've suspended
all guest passes

26:58.440 --> 27:00.100

Otherwise, we'd have been happy

to have her with us.
-All good.

will you?
-It's only for two hours.

You'd think we were going to the moon.
Girls, let's hustle.

27:09.600 --> 27:12.740
Thanks for that info, by the way.
It was really helpful.

27:12.840 --> 27:15.580
I should probably have said
it was a two-part favour.

27:21.840 --> 27:22.980
from the border tolls

27:23.080 --> 27:25.080
back to the initial military trauma.

27:25.760 --> 27:28.500
Any of your guys
out at the Richmond border last night?

27:28.600 --> 27:29.620
Yeah, I'm sure we can find something.

27:29.720 --> 27:31.740
Why don't you come with me
back to the office?

27:31.840 --> 27:33.840
We've got power there, too.

27:34.800 --> 27:36.800
Everybody ready?
-[Francesca] Yes.

27:37.120 --> 27:38.660
[PA system] Please make your way to the
climate lounge...

27:38.760 --> 27:42.060
[overlapping speech]

27:42.160 --> 27:43.420
[Ivy] Definitely not my homework.

27:43.520 --> 27:44.820
[Eadie] I'll give it to you when we get
down.

27:44.920 --> 27:47.800
-H. -H? Alright. Let's go.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.180
-Go on.
-Can I have that please?

27:50.280 --> 27:52.280
-Go with your mummy.
-Thank you.

27:53.160 --> 27:55.340
[sighs]

27:55.440 --> 27:57.060
-Your eye seems better.
-It's killing me.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.160
[Don] Give me a kiss goodbye.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.300
See you later.

28:01.400 --> 28:03.020
-See you soon.
-Bye-bye.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.660
Why do they have so many kids?

28:04.760 --> 28:08.340
[sighs] Dunno. Maybe they watched
<i>The Sound of Music</i> too many times.

28:08.440 --> 28:10.440
[Dom] Alright, let's go.

28:15.520 --> 28:17.300
[birds chirping]

28:17.400 --> 28:19.400
[elevator ding]

28:22.680 --> 28:24.100
[elevator ding]

28:24.200 --> 28:26.200
Thanks for that.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.240
I know. It's Harlow's brilliant idea.

28:34.200 --> 28:35.500
-Hang on a minute, will you.
-Sure.

28:35.600 --> 28:37.100
[Harlow] This is the guy
I was telling you about. So,

28:37.200 --> 28:38.900
I want you to meet my partner, Dom.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.020
Hello.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.220
Ainsley and Jonah are moving back

28:41.320 --> 28:42.660
after two years in Singapore

28:42.760 --> 28:43.740
and they're keen to make sure

28:43.840 --> 28:45.820
everything is organised before they land.
-It's good to meet you.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.860
Now, I'm going to make sure all
the numbers make sense,

28:47.960 --> 28:50.740
but Dom's got ten years
with the Air Force under his belt,

28:50.840 --> 28:51.980
so if there's a real problem,

28:52.080 --> 28:53.820
Dom's the man
who's going to come and get you.

28:53.920 --> 28:58.060
Well, I hope I don't have to. No offence.
I'll leave you guys to it. Alright?

28:58.160 --> 28:59.140
See ya, buddy.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.100
This guy's amazing.
-Don't.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.280
-I didn't say a word.
-You didn't have to.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.520
Come in.

29:10.320 --> 29:11.620
Is that live?

29:11.720 --> 29:13.700
Afraid so.

29:13.800 --> 29:15.800
Look's like the wind storm's reforming.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.060
Your lease must be up
for renewal soon, right?

29:20.160 --> 29:22.160
Can't say I know off the top of my head.

29:23.000 --> 29:26.400
You know there's an apartment
coming up - tenth floor.

29:27.600 --> 29:29.020
I had a chat
with a couple of the board members.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.700
I think I could swing it.
I think I could get you approved.

29:30.800 --> 29:32.800
Even if we could afford it,
we like our place.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.660
I know it's not your cup of tea,
but it's...

29:34.760 --> 29:36.540
-Falling apart?
-We like it, Dom.

29:36.640 --> 29:38.500
-You like the crime?
-It's real.

29:38.600 --> 29:39.580
We like the real.

29:39.680 --> 29:41.340
You say that now, but

29:41.440 --> 29:44.000
when there's
a baby in the mix, it...

29:45.440 --> 29:46.860
It changes things.
-If you can't find

29:46.960 --> 29:48.900
that footage, don't worry, because...
-Alright, alright.

29:49.000 --> 29:49.980
We should get a move on.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.860
I'm just trying to see
if I can access the body cam.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.380
I just don't want to get caught
in the outage --

29:54.480 --> 29:55.540
-Do you want this footage or not?

29:55.640 --> 29:56.620
-Yes, please.
-Alright,

29:56.720 --> 29:58.920
well just give me a second, will you?

30:02.120 --> 30:04.120
It's downloading.

30:06.320 --> 30:08.320
How are things?

30:10.880 --> 30:12.880
All good.

30:13.520 --> 30:14.980
Barren, but...

30:15.080 --> 30:16.700
All good.
-I'm sorry.

30:16.800 --> 30:17.780
Next week I think we have to

30:17.880 --> 30:20.280
face the fact that the baby train
has left without us.

30:21.200 --> 30:23.600
I can help, you know - financially.

30:24.240 --> 30:25.620
You know Lloyd
would never agree to it

30:25.720 --> 30:29.160
and it's just something,
we have to do it on our own.

30:31.480 --> 30:33.480
But thank you.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.060
Can I have that now?

30:36.160 --> 30:38.320
I actually am on a real deadline, so...

30:40.360 --> 30:41.420
Thank you.

30:41.520 --> 30:42.660
[clears throat] Ivy?

30:42.760 --> 30:44.800
Are you ready? Ivy.

30:51.360 --> 30:53.360
Bye.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.020
[Ivy] Is there actually a reason
that you won't let us move in there

30:56.120 --> 30:58.120
or are you just being perverse?

30:58.440 --> 30:59.940
[Eadie] I thought you were
listening to music.

31:00.040 --> 31:02.860
Because right now, they're all sitting
in a private climate lounge

31:02.960 --> 31:05.260
with a back-up generator
and cheese plates.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.900
It doesn't sound so horrible to me.

31:07.000 --> 31:08.020
[indistinct PA announcement]

31:08.120 --> 31:10.820
Somewhere like that, you can't just
knock on someone's door.

31:10.920 --> 31:12.500
You have to go through the concierge.

31:12.600 --> 31:13.940
And that's a problem how?

31:14.040 --> 31:16.020
If you need something,
you can't just reach out

31:16.120 --> 31:18.380
to the people next door
and see if they can help you out.

31:18.480 --> 31:22.020
You have to go down
to the concierge and he'll fix it.

31:22.120 --> 31:25.580
Not because he wants to
but because you've all contributed

31:25.680 --> 31:29.060
to the fees that pay him
to help you out. It's lose-lose.

31:29.160 --> 31:31.820
Here I was thinking
it was sounding all win-win.

31:31.920 --> 31:35.660
It's like living in an egg carton,
while our street,

31:35.760 --> 31:39.260
battered and run-down as it is, is
like a beehive.

31:39.360 --> 31:42.720
[PA announcement]<i> Scheduled voltage</i>

31:52.280 --> 31:53.260
[electronics powering down]

31:53.360 --> 31:55.920
[powering off tone]
Shit.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.060
People don't just get a car
this close to the outage,

32:00.160 --> 32:02.160
they plan ahead.

Really? How old are you?

33:04.040 --> 33:06.040
What the hell?

33:09.360 --> 33:12.520
Mum was right,
you're seriously unhinged.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.120
Goodo. You lead the way.

35:29.680 --> 35:31.680
Hey.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.480
Your room is ready, sir.

35:46.160 --> 35:51.500
This helps me see what's going on for you.
I'll be controlling the sound.

35:51.600 --> 35:54.440
You'll be able to hear my voice
through the speakers in the chair.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.660
The temperature, the light, the smell,

35:58.760 --> 36:02.480
it'll try and help reactivate the memories
as vividly as possible.

36:03.400 --> 36:06.320
We need to get as close
to maximum discomfort as we can.

36:07.160 --> 36:08.660
100 out of 100.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.760
Flush all the ghosts out.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.900
And then what?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.360
Then you take the beta-blocker

36:17.240 --> 36:20.340
and during your sleep cycle tonight,

36:20.440 --> 36:24.600
the emotional charge
won't be able to resettle into the memory.

36:26.080 --> 36:31.820
The shell of the building remains
but there'll be no furniture,

36:31.920 --> 36:34.240
none of your belongings,
nothing to make it feel personal.

36:35.440 --> 36:37.440
You ever done it?

36:38.360 --> 36:40.020
No, I've never done it.

36:40.120 --> 36:41.340
I just imagine it'd be tempting to do it,

36:41.440 --> 36:43.440
a bit of mental spring cleaning.

36:44.640 --> 36:46.640
Chase off whatever haunts you.

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
Nothing ever haunts you?

36:52.120 --> 36:54.120
Lucky old you.

36:56.200 --> 36:58.200
You ready?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.360
OK.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.840
We're going to start at the border.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.600
What time is it?

37:25.480 --> 37:27.480
It's, um...

37:28.360 --> 37:30.360
Just after midday.

37:30.960 --> 37:34.800
And it's hot, right? Just hit 40 degrees?

37:42.240 --> 37:44.240
[Eadie] Tell me what's happening.

37:45.520 --> 37:48.300
-[Ben] Um, I'm just checking permits.
-[woman] It's under a month.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.020
[Ben] Oh, if it's under a month it's fine.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.340
Just make sure you update it...

37:51.440 --> 37:53.600
Helping people work out
what they need to do.

37:58.000 --> 38:00.180
[Eadie] And then what?

38:00.280 --> 38:02.280
[man] This is why I'm here.

38:02.920 --> 38:06.560
[indistinct ranting]

38:07.840 --> 38:09.580
[Eadie] Ben,

38:09.680 --> 38:13.380
you're doing great.
So, you're heading up to the car.

38:13.480 --> 38:15.340
Which one is it?

38:15.440 --> 38:16.420
Third in the convoy.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.140
[loud traffic, horns]

38:18.240 --> 38:20.240
And there's a chopper.

38:21.040 --> 38:24.220
[Ben] Suddenly there's
so much dust, I can't see.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.320
What's the chopper doing?

38:26.840 --> 38:32.200
On the radio,
they said there might be food drops.

38:33.720 --> 38:34.780
In Idlib?

38:34.880 --> 38:38.920
[helicopter passing overhead]

38:40.480 --> 38:43.740
[Ben] That's why there are
so many people on the road.

38:43.840 --> 38:44.860
They've been starving them out

38:44.960 --> 38:47.080
since the beginning of the de-escalation.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.200
There's been an accident,
about half a K ahead.

38:54.880 --> 38:56.920
Third truck in the convoy.

38:59.240 --> 39:01.600
And more and more cars are arriving.

39:03.960 --> 39:05.060
They're blocking us in from both sides.

39:05.160 --> 39:07.780
[cars honking]

39:07.880 --> 39:09.880
And we're in the middle lane.

39:11.360 --> 39:14.320
We shouldn't be in the middle lane.
I tell them...

39:16.560 --> 39:19.040
I tell them I've got a bad feeling.
But they just...

39:20.200 --> 39:22.340
They just say, "Suck it up, buttercup."

39:22.440 --> 39:24.380
[gunshot]
[gunshot]

39:24.480 --> 39:26.460
[short gasp for breath]

39:26.560 --> 39:28.560
Tell me what's going on.

39:30.840 --> 39:32.540
I can't - I can't do this.

39:32.640 --> 39:35.400
Ben. Ben, you can do this.

39:36.080 --> 39:37.380
You're doing so well.

39:37.480 --> 39:39.460
You can do it.

39:39.560 --> 39:41.560
[Eadie] See if you can stay.

39:42.280 --> 39:44.800
We'll take it as slow as you need, OK?

39:48.560 --> 39:50.560
I don't know why, but I look...

39:51.880 --> 39:54.120
[Ben] I look into the car next to us.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.620
There's this guy staring at me.

39:58.720 --> 40:03.400
He's just staring and something bugs me.

40:10.360 --> 40:12.560
He leans down to the front of the car

40:13.240 --> 40:15.620
and I realise he's not a civilian.

40:15.720 --> 40:17.720
[gunfire]

40:21.280 --> 40:23.280
And then he...

40:25.720 --> 40:27.920
He's just pointing at me.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.480
Forever.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
[truck drives away]

40:35.520 --> 40:36.660
[gunfire]

40:36.760 --> 40:38.100
And then they're gone.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.200
[distant gunfire]

40:44.800 --> 40:46.800
[sharply inhales and exhales]

40:52.520 --> 40:55.280
That's it. You did great.

40:56.160 --> 40:58.160
Enough ghosts for you?

41:06.080 --> 41:07.460
Is that what happened at the border?

41:07.560 --> 41:09.180
The driver reached for something?

41:09.280 --> 41:11.420
Yeah.

41:11.520 --> 41:13.520
Yeah, just pulled me right back there.

41:19.480 --> 41:22.720
[gentle dramatic music]

41:32.160 --> 41:35.280
[storm rumbling]

42:00.880 --> 42:02.880
Thanks.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.400
[thunder]

42:30.920 --> 42:32.920
I'm not gonna be a mum.

42:34.160 --> 42:36.160
And even though, logically,

42:37.040 --> 42:40.280
I knew that was
a very real possibility when we started,

42:41.880 --> 42:44.320
I don't think I ever really believed it.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.360
[thunder]

42:48.440 --> 42:50.440
I said I did, because...

42:52.360 --> 42:54.360
Because that's what a realist would do.

42:57.000 --> 43:01.180
Because it proved I wasn't
one of those desperate nutters

43:01.280 --> 43:06.040
who could only imagine life worth living
if they have a child to love.

43:12.840 --> 43:14.840
But I never really...

43:16.920 --> 43:18.820
Let it in.

43:18.920 --> 43:20.920
And now I have to.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.000
'Cause it's true.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.120
And it's harder
than I thought it would be.

43:34.320 --> 43:36.680
[thunder crashes]

43:44.280 --> 43:46.440
What do we do with the last embryo?

43:50.160 --> 43:52.160
