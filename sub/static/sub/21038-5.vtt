WEBVTT

00:50.600 --> 00:53.626
So the plan is, the Royalist fleet
will land in France,

00:53.800 --> 00:56.109
overthrow the Republic
and free its prisoners?

00:56.280 --> 00:58.783
- So Caroline_believes.
- (Baby grizzles)

00:58.960 --> 01:00.939
(Baby coughs)

01:04.120 --> 01:06.543
Should we not give that plan a chance?

01:06.720 --> 01:08.779
I want Dwight home too.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.743
I just want you here a little longer.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.899
(Men coughing and groaning)

01:36.600 --> 01:38.977
I promised him something I cannot fulfil:

01:41.640 --> 01:44.746
to see this ring reaches his wife.

01:45.760 --> 01:47.660
I wonder you're not married, Enys.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.579
Are you so devoted to your work?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.179
In truth, there is someone.

01:57.960 --> 02:00.337
I doubt I'll ever see her again. And you?

02:01.240 --> 02:05.859
I'm a Boscowan so I'm expected
to make a splendid match.

02:06.880 --> 02:08.859
Some rich and beautiful heiress?

02:10.480 --> 02:12.664
I've a fancy to choose my own bride.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.144
CAROLINE: So plans are being finalised.

02:21.320 --> 02:22.503
What do 'ee intend?

02:22.680 --> 02:27.105
To lead an army of those loyal to the Monarchy,
to sail to France and overthrow the Revolution.

02:27.280 --> 02:30.943
- The landing will be 20 miles from Quimper.
- Where Dwight is?

02:31.120 --> 02:34.863
To think I wasted my time pressing
the Admiralty to release Dwight,

02:35.040 --> 02:38.544
when this landing will enable
all prisoners to be released.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.703
ROSS: I admire Caroline's optimism.

02:42.880 --> 02:43.983
But?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.739
War is never simple.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.025
Nor human nature.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.385
You've been to war.
What is it that drives men to act like savages?

02:53.560 --> 02:56.222
A refusal to see their fellow men as human.

02:56.920 --> 03:00.026
To view them instead
as a symbol of something they hate.

03:02.040 --> 03:05.225
Then there are no depths to the atrocities
which may be committed.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.499
You fear for Dwight?

03:08.680 --> 03:11.706
This landing could provoke
a slaughter of prisoners.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.098
It may be weeks
before the Royalists reach Quimper.

03:14.280 --> 03:16.259
Dwight may not last that long.

03:24.840 --> 03:26.102
(Baby cries)

03:26.280 --> 03:28.657
My son has rickets?

03:28.840 --> 03:30.546
- Dr Choake believes...
- He is mistook!

03:31.440 --> 03:34.659
My son is not some commoner's child,
nursed on gin and housed in squalor!

03:34.840 --> 03:36.580
He's had the best of everything.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.320
No one _must hear of this.
My son Will not be deformed.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.459
George, do not say that!

03:42.480 --> 03:44.823
Dr Choake believes he can be cured.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.499
Thank you, ma'am.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.779
(Door closes)

03:57.080 --> 03:59.742
There's to be a gathering at Tregothnan.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.627
- Lord Falmouth's?
- The St Aubyns and Godolphins will be there.

04:02.800 --> 04:05.542
Our invitation is conspicuous by its absence.

04:05.720 --> 04:07.699
Are you so keen to go?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.780
These events are often so dull.

04:09.960 --> 04:13.623
_ Presence at "these events" _
IS what confirms one's status In socrety.

04:14.280 --> 04:17.226
If the Godolphins are going,
Lady Whitworth will be there.

04:17.400 --> 04:20.460
She could procure you an invitation.
Could you not speak to Osborne?

04:20.640 --> 04:22.619
I could ifI had positive news for him.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.622
But while Morwenna continues to prevaricate,
I can hardly beg favours of his mother.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.825
I would have thought, after weeks at Trenwith,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.582
the girl would be out of her mind
with boredom by now.

04:31.760 --> 04:33.500
(Morwenna laughs)

04:52.840 --> 04:54.307
(Signs)

04:59.360 --> 05:01.260
(TutS)

05:02.920 --> 05:04.899
There you go.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.664
I 'ave news from Mr Trencrom.

05:07.840 --> 05:11.344
His ship, The One And All,
on its last run,

05:11.520 --> 05:15.217
did bring ashore a Dutch merchant
lately released from the prison at Quimper.

05:15.400 --> 05:20.144
- Where Dr Enys be interned?
- This merchant say 'tis like a hellhole now.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.869
Men droppin' like flies of fever, starvation.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.100
An' those as remain bein' executed for sport.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.659
He do fear there'll be none left alive
within three week.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.217
'Tis a sorry end for our friend and brother.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.349
Would there was aught we could do to help him.

05:36.520 --> 05:38.624
And if there was?

05:43.920 --> 05:46.821
SOLDIER: Venez.
Montrez-moi les yeux.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.822
Wait! This man has a fever!

05:53.000 --> 05:54.581
II a de la fivre!

05:54.760 --> 05:56.739
Tu as de la chance, monsieur!

05:58.480 --> 06:00.459
(Musket fire)

06:01.760 --> 06:03.739
What happened?

06:04.840 --> 06:07.104
A new entertainment has begun.

06:07.280 --> 06:10.340
Dicing for officers. Executions on a whim.

06:10.520 --> 06:13.080
Today, on the colour of a man's eyes.

06:14.080 --> 06:15.183
Tomorrow?

06:16.320 --> 06:18.299
Who knows?

06:27.480 --> 06:30.119
Geoffrey Charles's friend was here again.

06:30.280 --> 06:31.383
Oh.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.339
Yes, he called to bring some toads.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.583
He's very fond of Geoffrey Charles.

06:37.760 --> 06:39.500
And of you too...

06:39.680 --> 06:41.625
or so I observed this afternoon.

06:43.480 --> 06:45.937
Love makes us careless, does it not?

06:46.120 --> 06:49.999
What do you imagine
George would do if he found out?

06:50.160 --> 06:54.904
Oh, yes, I'm usually the first to defy him
but that's because I have little to lose.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.661
Do you?

06:56.840 --> 06:59.297
I cannot marry Mr Whitworth.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.426
You cannot marry Drake Came.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.663
George is a cruel man

07:05.840 --> 07:09.867
and his axe would fall not on you,
who are cousin to his wife,

07:10.040 --> 07:14.101
but on the boy, who is kin to Ross.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.027
Give him up, my dear.

07:21.240 --> 07:24.027
For his sake as much as your own.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.664
Even if the landing's successful,

07:30.840 --> 07:34.105
the Royalist Army will have its hands full
fighting the Republic.

07:34.800 --> 07:37.439
Freeing English prisoners will not be a priority.

07:38.640 --> 07:41.620
So I'm thinking there needs to be
a more direct attempt.

07:41.800 --> 07:44.542
- Involving Tholly?
- And Zaclq and Henshawe.

07:44.720 --> 07:47.223
- Respectable family men?
- As I've told them repeatedly.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.960
But Dwight is held in high esteem.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.865
They both leapt at the chance to serve him.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.497
- So what will you do?
- Take passage with the fleet.

07:55.680 --> 07:59.104
But as soon as we land in Brittany,
leave the Royalists to their fight...

08:00.160 --> 08:02.947
...then, under cover of the uprising...

08:03.120 --> 08:06.897
Make your way to the prison,
free Dwight an' bring him home.

08:07.080 --> 08:09.583
What could be simpler?

08:12.320 --> 08:14.584
Ross Poldark? A contender for Parliament?

08:14.760 --> 08:17.467
According to my mother
who has it from the Boscowans.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.825
- How can he even presume?
- I'm not sure he does.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.458
- He's been mentioned, not yet approached.
- Nor should he be.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.099
Is such a man to represent us?

08:30.840 --> 08:33.502
Well, he certainly won't be receiving my vote.

08:45.800 --> 08:50.146
So you see, Aunt,
my visits here must cease awhile.

08:51.640 --> 08:53.619
All in good cause, boy.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.225
I trust you'll bring young Enys safely home.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.779
And fetch him to my party.

09:02.640 --> 09:04.983
- Which?
- My 100th birthday.

09:06.240 --> 09:12.577
You're all invited, your chibbies,
your little bud and even her brother.

09:14.240 --> 09:18.267
- You've met him?
- Oh, yes.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.440
'Ee seem troubled. What ails 'ee?

09:34.520 --> 09:35.987
My conscience.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.720
Which tells me I have done a wicked thing.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.297
There be nothing wicked
in our care for each other.

09:43.480 --> 09:46.938
The wicked thing is that I've allowed your visits...

09:48.680 --> 09:50.659
...when I'm not free to do so.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.099
How not free?

09:56.440 --> 09:57.623
Our friendship...

09:57.800 --> 10:00.701
Has gone beyond the bounds
of common acquaintance.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.389
But is it wrong to go so far...

10:06.720 --> 10:08.699
...if what we feel is true?

10:14.080 --> 10:16.059
I see now it is not true.

10:17.640 --> 10:21.303
I was flattered by your attentions
into thinking I felt love.

10:25.040 --> 10:27.019
But I do not.

10:31.520 --> 10:32.942
I don't believe you.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.099
I hope you can forgive my mistake.

10:43.880 --> 10:45.507
(SObs)

11:31.320 --> 11:35.586
I've_left word with Grace
that they wnll answer to you tIll I return.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.307
They will expect you daily.

11:37.480 --> 11:39.744
P'raps I'll venture below
an' take a pick 0' my own.

11:39.920 --> 11:41.899
No doubt you'll find a new lode.

11:42.760 --> 11:47.902
I've been thinkin', I'll not tell Caroline where
you've gone for fear of raisin' false hopes.

11:48.080 --> 11:51.504
- And have Drake stay away from Trenwith.
- Why would he go there?

11:53.280 --> 11:55.066
Ask him.

11:56.120 --> 11:57.621
I must go.

12:00.880 --> 12:02.859
I do not ask you not to be reckless...

12:04.120 --> 12:07.942
...for I know you cannot promise something
which is so against your nature.

12:30.760 --> 12:32.625
She don't care for me.

12:32.800 --> 12:34.381
She never did.

12:37.240 --> 12:39.549
I've no wish to go on in this world.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.509
I once thought as you do.

12:45.480 --> 12:49.587
When I lost Julia,
all I wanted was to bury myself beside her.

12:52.440 --> 12:56.547
But life is precious and should not be scorned.

12:57.800 --> 13:02.499
The thing is to find some purpose,
to go on living.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.179
And if Ross were here, he'd say the same.

13:08.480 --> 13:10.345
Where is he?

13:12.840 --> 13:14.819
It's not to be spoken of.

13:16.200 --> 13:21.786
He's gone to Falmouth, thence to France
to rescue our friend Dr Enys.

13:27.080 --> 13:29.059
Will you not stay to supper?

13:34.560 --> 13:36.539
Thank 'ee, sister.

13:37.440 --> 13:40.785
I'll heed what 'ee say about purpose...

13:43.600 --> 13:45.579
...an' try and find me some.

14:10.880 --> 14:14.577
...la Bretagne, I'endr0it idal
pour desembarquer nos troupes.

14:14.760 --> 14:17.661
- Pourquofi
- Nous o'e vans paﬂw sans tamer.

14:23.560 --> 14:24.663
Problem?

14:24.840 --> 14:27.263
Aside from the fact
they've thrice delayed departure

14:27.440 --> 14:29.419
and are unable to agree on
the simplest matter?

14:29.600 --> 14:34.742
There's the thing. Almost all the Royalist troops
travellin' from England be French prisoners.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.159
They'll be given a choice.

14:38.320 --> 14:41.949
Bide here in prison or fight for the Royalists
against the Republic.

14:42.120 --> 14:45.180
- How's that a problem?
- If you're a prisoner returned to home shores,

14:45.360 --> 14:48.420
do you fight against your own people
or do you desert?

14:49.240 --> 14:52.346
- This landing will fail.
- Then how do we save Dr Enys?

14:57.640 --> 14:59.141
Say nothing to the French.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.538
I'll return in an hour.

15:02.880 --> 15:06.304
Pas tous les Frangais sont fidles la France.
Certains sont fidles eux-mmes.

15:06.480 --> 15:07.868
Qui peut les en blmer?

15:13.160 --> 15:16.106
Ross is called away to Looe
on business at the boatyard.

15:16.280 --> 15:19.022
And the Royalists will shortly
sail from Falmouth.

15:19.200 --> 15:23.864
I wish I were going with them.
But how shall we distract ourselves meanwhile?

15:25.480 --> 15:27.744
I know!
You could accompany me to Tregothnan.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.060
Lord Falmouth's gathering
the cream of Cornish aristocracy.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.821
I'm no aristocrat.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.345
You have nobler blood than many
who'll be wing to attend.

15:36.520 --> 15:39.102
Come, say you'll keep me company.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.905
...et remettre au pouvoir un Bourbon.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.945
Le Comte de Provence.

15:47.120 --> 15:48.940
- Le plus rapidement possible.
- Non, non.

15:49.120 --> 15:51.099
C'est ce qu'il faut faire!

15:52.280 --> 15:54.259
We're leaving.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.023
Arrtez cat/(e tyranme une ﬁdvs. par/(owl
Est-me que vous comprenez’?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.179
C'est ce qu'il va falloir faire!

16:19.640 --> 16:20.982
HENSHAWE: Never been to Roscoff.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.139
Only once been on the One And All.

16:24.400 --> 16:28.063
Mr Trencrom said he was
the first respectable man he'd had aboard.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.617
- We'll soon lead 'im astray.
- I need no leading.

16:30.800 --> 16:34.179
- I've tricks 0' my own up my sleeve!
- What happens when we get to Roscoff?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.920
Trencr0m's men go about their usual business.

16:37.800 --> 16:39.984
And we acquire a smaller vessel.

16:40.320 --> 16:45.383
Then take the river inland,
to a creek close to the prison at Quimper.

16:58.640 --> 17:00.028
Plans have changed.

17:01.120 --> 17:04.499
- Ross and his men be on their own now.
- Judas.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.343
- Lve-toi.
- No! Let me go!

17:16.480 --> 17:17.583
Please!

17:19.680 --> 17:21.420
(Musket fire)

17:21.600 --> 17:23.579
(Soldiers snigger)

17:31.160 --> 17:33.139
Have 'ee seen Drake?

17:33.920 --> 17:35.023
Yesterday.

17:35.800 --> 17:37.779
Wrack'd with grief over the girl.

17:39.200 --> 17:41.179
Left 'ee this note.

17:45.800 --> 17:47.779
(Reads) Dear sister...

17:48.200 --> 17:52.102
Let's hope these will do the trick.
You got enough?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.105
The Captain beg to report a stowaway.

17:57.280 --> 17:58.986
Is that my concern?

17:59.160 --> 18:02.744
He say so on account
0' the stowaway insist on joinin' us.

18:11.680 --> 18:14.183
DEMELZ4: Do not blame Cap ’/7 Ross for this.

18:15.200 --> 18:18.067
You tell'd me to find some purpose
to help me forget Morvvenna.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.499
And this may do good to someone if not to I.

18:22.680 --> 18:26.787
I know he thought me harsh,
but I did fear this love would break 'im.

18:26.960 --> 18:28.939
An' so it has.

18:30.360 --> 18:32.225
Is this God's will too?

18:32.400 --> 18:34.300
DRAKE C I know what lee he th/hk/hi

18:34.480 --> 18:37.040
But let me prove myself. I'm fearless.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.760
- That's no recommendation.
- An' steadfast an' fierce.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.184
Like his sister?

18:42.360 --> 18:44.021
I say give him a chance.

18:44.200 --> 18:47.624
You never know when an extra man
might come In handy.

18:52.440 --> 18:54.305
You will obey my every command.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.937
- Without question.
- Yes, sir!

19:03.400 --> 19:05.857
- Well done.
- Well done.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.907
Drake told me you broke with him.

19:29.880 --> 19:31.859
Doubtless he'll soon forget me.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.139
He might.

19:36.080 --> 19:38.059
If we see him again.

19:40.800 --> 19:45.544
It was not without difficulty
that my mother secured your invitation.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.506
I'm obliged to her.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.542
She did so on the understanding
that you and she would shortly be connected.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.984
Through my marriage to Miss Chynoweth.

19:57.400 --> 20:03.066
She feels if we do not hear from the lady soon,
we must look elsewhere.

20:03.800 --> 20:07.384
Morwenna is a respectable girl
who will not be hurried.

20:11.560 --> 20:16.623
Nevertheless, I'm certain you'll receive
a favourable answer within the month.

20:17.680 --> 20:18.749
Hm.

20:18.920 --> 20:21.559
I'd never have broken with him
had I known what he'd do.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.142
'Tis for the best.

20:23.320 --> 20:26.266
- The gulf between your stations is...
- Is great...

20:26.440 --> 20:30.388
But greater still the rift between our houses.

20:32.200 --> 20:34.464
So I should marry a man I do not love?

20:48.520 --> 20:51.080
Will you find a way to let me know
when Drake returns?

20:52.960 --> 20:55.019
If he returns.

21:10.640 --> 21:12.267
DRAKE: Do we not go ashore?

21:12.440 --> 21:14.783
Roscost not for the faint-hearted.

21:14.960 --> 21:16.348
But what do Cap'n Ross intend?

21:16.520 --> 21:18.385
Grab your belongings and follow him.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.777
We have a boat.

21:46.880 --> 21:50.464
Your cousin has delayed long enough.
I require an immediate answer.

21:50.640 --> 21:53.097
- Summon heerrom Trenwith.
- o.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.464
I have a better idea.

22:07.560 --> 22:11.144
- (Door slams)
- They've returned. Unannounced!

22:11.320 --> 22:12.981
What does it mean?

22:13.160 --> 22:15.663
Nothing good for you, I fear.

22:23.080 --> 22:26.299
Here is the best landing point close to Quimper.

22:26.480 --> 22:31.679
We'll put in there, wait for the cover
of darkness and then make for the prison.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.225
GEORGE: You ’re quite certain of this?

22:41.400 --> 22:43.186
'Eard tell of it in Sawle Kiddley.

22:43.360 --> 22:47.239
'Ee do know I 'ave ways 0' keepin'
my ear to the ground.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.583
(George laughs)

22:48.760 --> 22:50.739
GEORGE: You may go. (Laughs)

22:51.920 --> 22:54.184
That really is excellent.

22:54.360 --> 23:00.299
A prison break on French soil with respectable
men who are surely being led to their deaths.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.107
He's played right into our hands.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.100
But how could this affect us?

23:04.280 --> 23:08.307
By affecting Ross's standing amongst
the local worthies. You must see, my dear.

23:08.480 --> 23:12.109
How can such a re_ckless_foo|
represent the district in Parliament?

23:12.920 --> 23:17.300
It is a question I feel duty bound
to ask tonight at Tregothnan.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.459
(Sfliggers)

23:46.280 --> 23:50.341
- Tom Harry's got wind of it.
- Judas! Then half the county'll know!

23:50.520 --> 23:55.389
'Tis unlike to endanger the mission
since the news cannot reach France.

23:56.280 --> 23:57.907
So there's some consolation.

23:58.080 --> 24:01.982
Precious little. Ross wished it
to remain secret till he returned.

24:03.880 --> 24:05.984
How can I keep it from Caroline?

24:07.480 --> 24:08.868
A fever?

24:09.040 --> 24:11.019
I must say you look none the worse for it.

24:12.080 --> 24:14.105
I think I must keep indoors tonight.

24:14.280 --> 24:18.705
- I was hoping you'd bide with me.
- My dear, I'm beginning to look like a recluse.

24:18.880 --> 24:21.986
I must put in an appearance,
with or without my escort.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.519
- Do you not like it?
- It's so extravagant.

24:43.680 --> 24:44.783
And?

24:44.960 --> 24:50.341
Might it not seem, in tonight's company,
that we're trying too hard to impress?

24:55.520 --> 24:57.385
Quite right, my dear.

24:57.560 --> 24:59.425
No need for distractions.

24:59.600 --> 25:01.579
Our mission is plain.

25:01.760 --> 25:06.777
To thoroughly discredit Ross Poldark
and position me as a candidate in his stead.

25:06.960 --> 25:08.939
(Knock on door)

25:11.000 --> 25:13.901
- Must I really go?
- Did we not agree, my dear?

25:14.080 --> 25:15.547
No more ingratitude.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.825
As sharp as you can.

25:28.000 --> 25:31.265
Everyone ashore, take cover in the woods.

25:36.840 --> 25:38.819
(String quartet plays)

25:50.600 --> 25:54.343
Mr and Mrs Warleggan and Miss Chynoweth.

25:59.000 --> 26:02.697
- There's Lord Falmouth.
- And who here might effect an introduction?

26:02.880 --> 26:05.860
Miss Penvenen and Mistress Poldark.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.423
Extraordinary!

26:13.400 --> 26:17.029
I'm forced to ingratiate myself
with that idiot Whitworth

26:17.200 --> 26:21.079
whilst the scullery maid strolls in
on the arm of an heiress!

26:22.480 --> 26:28.020
Look at them. Struttin' an' swaggerin',
as if there be no war or men riskin' their lives.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.986
Pay them no heed, my dear.

26:30.160 --> 26:33.220
Our task is to see what news_
we can glean of the French landing.

26:37.960 --> 26:39.985
This is the ground plan.

26:40.160 --> 26:43.459
There's a series of buildings,
set in extensive grounds.

26:43.640 --> 26:48.987
Here is a sentry gate, through which we must
pass before coming into the main prison.

26:50.000 --> 26:52.343
The guards are changed at midnight.

26:53.360 --> 26:56.659
We go in at one
and hope to catch them napping.

26:58.360 --> 27:00.419
What is it?

27:01.960 --> 27:06.420
When I first mooted this venture,
I imagined we'd be part of the Royalist landing,

27:06.600 --> 27:09.546
taking advantage of the chaos
to break into the prison.

27:09.720 --> 27:13.668
But now we've come on ahead,
we're that much more exposed.

27:18.320 --> 27:21.221
Since this is not what you enlisted for,

27:21.400 --> 27:24.779
I feel you should be given the chance
to remain here.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.737
- Tholly and I will make for the prison.
- Nay, Ross.

27:28.920 --> 27:31.377
Speaking for myself, my mind's set.

27:32.200 --> 27:34.657
We're here for Dr Enys
and we'll not go home without him.

27:34.840 --> 27:36.546
'Tis what we all signed up for.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.625
Can I ask men to take such a risk?

27:41.560 --> 27:44.506
Yet how much have I risked,
across the years, alongside you

27:44.680 --> 27:47.183
knowin' I might lose all, riskin' it anyway?

27:48.160 --> 27:50.469
Mining's a risk.

27:50.640 --> 27:52.585
Loving's a risk.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.137
Living's a risk.

27:55.320 --> 27:59.427
So tonight...I'|| take my chance.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.499
(Church bell chimes)

28:03.720 --> 28:05.267
Is it time?

28:05.960 --> 28:07.939
Bone. Ellery. Go back and guard the boat.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.781
The rest of you? Certain?

28:09.960 --> 28:12.383
- No fool like an old fool!
- Or a young one.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.466
Keep low and follow me.

28:22.080 --> 28:25.026
LORD FALMOUTH:
He's been in numerous skirmishes.

28:25.200 --> 28:29.261
He is the most able navigator.
Ned Pellew thinks the world of him.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.989
Of course the boy knows what's expected
of him. He's a Boscowan, after all.

28:33.160 --> 28:36.584
Though little good it's done him.
Will you excuse me?

28:54.280 --> 28:56.020
(Owl hoots)

29:03.880 --> 29:04.983
ROSS: Clear.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.025
HENSHAWE: How many guards, do we think?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.179
ROSS: In addition to those at the gate?

29:17.800 --> 29:20.382
Six inside the building.
Another six off-duty. Who knows?

29:20.560 --> 29:23.586
Tell 'em no more, young Cap'n,
lest they lose their appetite for the task!

29:23.760 --> 29:26.581
- That won't happen.
- How do we get past the guards?

29:26.760 --> 29:29.900
Tholly, tie my hands.

29:49.520 --> 29:51.659
ai un prisonnier chapp!

29:52.360 --> 29:55.102
Au nom de la Rpublique, ouvrez la porte!

29:56.160 --> 29:58.025
Dpchez-i/ous, hem’?

29:58.200 --> 30:00.100
ll fait froid!

30:04.320 --> 30:05.662
(Soldier mutters)

30:08.120 --> 30:10.099
(Blows thudding, grunting)

30:15.040 --> 30:16.177
(Whistles)

30:44.480 --> 30:46.459
(Raps on gate)

30:49.040 --> 30:51.019
Sssh.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.549
Ssh-ssh-ssh. Keep quiet.

31:01.040 --> 31:03.941
The prisoners will be sleeping.
Endeavour to pass through unnoticed.

31:04.120 --> 31:07.226
At all costs, give no impression
we're here to free prisoners.

31:07.400 --> 31:10.039
Aye, the last thing we need
is a mad stampede to escape.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.383
Follow me.

31:39.360 --> 31:40.907
What's going on?

31:41.080 --> 31:44.060
- Who are you?
- Newly arrived here.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.059
We have a message for Dr Enys.

31:47.240 --> 31:49.265
D'you know where he is?

31:50.040 --> 31:53.385
- The Infirmary. Enys never leaves it.
- Thank you, friend.

32:02.320 --> 32:05.460
- There's no room in here.
- We're looking for Dr Enys.

32:07.360 --> 32:10.545
- Who are you?
- Captain Ross Poldark. You?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.745
Lieutenant Armitage of the Espion.

32:12.920 --> 32:15.662
- Sir, I think these men have no business here.
- No business with you.

32:15.840 --> 32:20.265
We seek Dr Enys and mean only his good.

32:20.440 --> 32:23.864
- You have my word as an officer.
- Sir, these man are armed.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.702
An' I'll slit yer throat if you don't pipe down!

32:29.200 --> 32:32.146
Have you broken in to take Enys?

32:36.120 --> 32:37.382
Not a word.

32:37.560 --> 32:39.539
Come with me.

32:50.800 --> 32:52.779
(Coughing)

33:09.200 --> 33:11.065
What is it?

33:11.240 --> 33:13.583
Do you want me?

33:13.760 --> 33:15.739
Yes, Dwight.

33:18.240 --> 33:20.219
We want you.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.959
Ross?

33:26.080 --> 33:28.059
My friend...

33:29.520 --> 33:31.385
...make haste and come with us.

33:31.560 --> 33:35.462
Come? Where?

33:38.840 --> 33:40.819
(Chuckles) How?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.319
What do you mean?

33:47.480 --> 33:51.587
I mean that your friends
have risked life and limb to free you.

33:56.760 --> 34:00.582
But you must see that's impossible.

34:03.200 --> 34:08.263
I cannot abandon these men._
There are only four surgeons in the entire camp.

34:09.240 --> 34:11.379
So we should go home without you?

34:11.560 --> 34:15.985
Enys, you have more than discharged your duty.

34:19.440 --> 34:21.749
Don't be a fool, Enys.

34:21.920 --> 34:24.559
We'd a|| escape if we had the chance.

34:24.720 --> 34:26.347
escape?

34:26.520 --> 34:29.307
- Escape!
- Damn, the young fool will wake half of France.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.822
We can't go back that way.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.787
- Is there another way out?
- That way!

34:34.560 --> 34:36.539
(Distant yelling)

34:43.040 --> 34:45.019
(Soldiers yell)

34:50.240 --> 34:52.583
- (Bell rings)
- That's the alarm bell.

34:52.760 --> 34:55.183
- All the guards will be summoned.
- Which is the way out?

34:55.360 --> 34:57.703
There. That door.

34:57.880 --> 34:59.939
The guards. They'll be waiting for us.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.680
- We can't go back through the church.
- Then we're trapped.

35:02.840 --> 35:04.979
(Guard yells orders)

35:07.600 --> 35:09.579
(Laughter and conversation)

35:12.040 --> 35:14.383
- Have you heard the rumours?
- Which?

35:14.560 --> 35:17.120
Ross Poldark's latest folly.

35:18.280 --> 35:21.260
- His reckless assault on a French prison.
- Surely not?

35:21.440 --> 35:25.467
- Let's take some refreshment.
- The absolute futility of such an act!

35:25.640 --> 35:29.019
- What does it say of one who would attempt it?
- What, indeed?

35:30.080 --> 35:33.629
And did I hear he's being considered
for some high office?

35:33.800 --> 35:38.180
Dear God! Is that _the kind of madman
we want representing us in Parliament?

35:53.960 --> 35:55.587
Allez! Regardez partout!

35:55.760 --> 35:58.661
Load your weapons. We'll make a stand.

35:58.840 --> 36:01.946
My apologies, Dwight.
This is a poor sort of rescue!

36:02.120 --> 36:04.907
Cap'n Ross, I b'lieve there be a better way.

36:07.600 --> 36:08.919
Stay here.

36:09.080 --> 36:11.105
Escape! Escape! Escape!

36:11.280 --> 36:12.349
(Musket fire)

36:12.520 --> 36:14.499
(Confused shouting)

36:23.240 --> 36:24.628
Armez-vous!

36:28.880 --> 36:30.939
Let's be gone. Quickly!

36:38.240 --> 36:40.026
Allez! Dpchez-vous!

36:44.440 --> 36:47.386
Would you prefer Oxford or Bath?

36:47.560 --> 36:49.300
For what, sir?

36:49.480 --> 36:51.584
Our honeymoon?

36:51.760 --> 36:54.103
I prefer not to speak of such a thing.

36:54.280 --> 36:55.747
All the more to tease me?

36:56.920 --> 37:00.139
- I pray you do not imagine...
- Oh, but I do, my dear.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.345
All the time.

37:12.720 --> 37:15.541
Par l! Allez, allez, allez!

37:17.960 --> 37:19.985
- It's locked.
- (Groans)

37:20.160 --> 37:22.663
- Over? _
- He'll never make it.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.341
What do we do?

37:25.680 --> 37:28.422
I told you I'd have something up my sleeve.
Stand back, lads!

37:28.600 --> 37:29.988
Leave it to the expert!

37:30.160 --> 37:32.219
Zacky, Tholly, take Dwight.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.503
Nearly there!

37:35.200 --> 37:36.940
Stand back, lads!

37:37.120 --> 37:38.382
Take cover!

37:46.640 --> 37:48.028
Now get up! Let's go!

37:48.200 --> 37:50.509
Drake, come with me.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.902
Par ici! lls sont partis par ici!

37:58.240 --> 38:00.185
Look out. Ross!

38:03.840 --> 38:05.819
(Confused shouting)

38:09.400 --> 38:11.345
- Watch out, Ross!
- Take mine!

38:15.480 --> 38:17.459
Hensh... Follow me!

38:21.560 --> 38:22.879
- (Gunshot)
- Argh!

38:23.800 --> 38:25.779
He's hit!

38:31.240 --> 38:32.787
- (Gunshot)
- Argh!

38:36.080 --> 38:38.389
We need a place to hide him.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.659
Dwight, Henshawe's hit.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.263
(Rasping breaths)

38:44.760 --> 38:46.546
Can you hear me, Hensh?

38:49.880 --> 38:51.859
What can be done for him?

38:56.280 --> 38:57.668
Nothing.

38:58.720 --> 38:59.857
Try.

39:00.040 --> 39:03.225
If there was aught to be done,
do you think I'd spare myself?

39:07.080 --> 39:09.537
I told him not to come.

39:11.000 --> 39:12.979
But he wouldn't listen.

39:14.840 --> 39:16.705
We're too old for this, Hensh.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.543
What do we say?
No fool like an old fool?

39:22.040 --> 39:27.023
We'll be dead fools if we don't get a gallop on!
D'you think these Frenchies be firin' for fun?

39:27.200 --> 39:29.384
- Help me carry him.
- We'll never make it!

39:29.560 --> 39:31.937
- Then I'll stay with him.
- Nay, I will.

39:32.120 --> 39:35.385
- He was my captain and friend.
- Let me stay! I don't care what become 0' me.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.425
There's no need to stay.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.227
He's dead.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.027
DWIGHT: He's dead.

39:42.200 --> 39:43.542
Gardez vos positions!

39:43.720 --> 39:45.142
Par ici!

39:51.840 --> 39:53.819
Come away, Ross.

40:01.040 --> 40:02.428
Ross!

40:19.480 --> 40:20.822
Excuse me.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.662
I promised Lord Falmouth the Allemande.

40:29.560 --> 40:31.539
Do you not dance, ma'am?

40:31.720 --> 40:33.699
Does your husband disapprove of the sport?

40:33.880 --> 40:35.541
Not in the least.

40:35.720 --> 40:40.100
How could he, when his own pursuits
are so much more hazardous?

40:41.040 --> 40:43.861
Is it not galling to be married to such a hothead?

40:44.920 --> 40:48.742
Bad enough in a 20-year-old but
in a supposedly respectable mine owner,

40:48.920 --> 40:51.343
in his 305, with a wife and children,

40:51.520 --> 40:53.829
it's positively infantile.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.184
Do you think he'll ever grow up?

40:57.280 --> 41:00.147
I don't know, George. Will you?

41:07.600 --> 41:09.579
(Distant shouting)

41:11.840 --> 41:13.819
Everyone down! Someone's coming.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.899
Armitage!

41:40.760 --> 41:43.342
- Thank God! I thought you were the guards.
- Are you alone?

41:43.520 --> 41:46.546
A dozen or so others escaped
but we all separated.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.467
They headed for the coast.
I abandoned my post, Enys.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.700
- The thought of freedom was too much for me.
- It was too much for us all.

41:53.880 --> 41:57.384
There's talk of a Royalist landing.
Republican troops are mobilising.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.744
If we're caught now, there'll be no escape.

41:59.920 --> 42:02.263
- And no mercy.
- Up!

42:42.160 --> 42:44.025
The power of an ancient family name.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.577
Chynoweths stroll in
where Warleggans fear to tread.

42:46.760 --> 42:49.217
- Did you manage to advance our cause?
- How?

42:50.120 --> 42:53.897
- By the subtle disparaging of Ross.
- I observed no such subtlety from you.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.640
Did you speak of his adventures in France?

42:56.800 --> 43:01.920
I might have done had Lord Falmouth not
mentioned his nephew is a prisoner of war.

43:02.920 --> 43:05.787
I felt it would be tactless
to refer to French prisons at all,

43:05.960 --> 43:07.985
let alone Ross's intention to storm one!

43:08.160 --> 43:09.787
So our mission has failed.

43:12.200 --> 43:14.179
We're leaving.

43:15.960 --> 43:17.746
Morwenna.

43:18.720 --> 43:20.699
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

43:24.440 --> 43:27.147
- The Royalist landing has failed.
- What?

43:27.320 --> 43:31.097
De Sombreuil and the leaders are captured.
What hope is there for Dwight now?

43:35.040 --> 43:37.019
(Birds chattering)

43:43.240 --> 43:44.741
Come on.

43:46.680 --> 43:49.706
Drake's hurt. Help me get him aboard.

43:50.720 --> 43:53.780
Here's Dr Enys. Help him on. Careful.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.063
Muskets.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.901
Set the oars! Set the oars!

44:32.360 --> 44:34.339
Poor Caroline!

44:35.240 --> 44:39.347
I took her home and put her to bed,
but I doubt she'll sleep.

44:41.080 --> 44:43.298
Thank God Ross wasn't part of the landing.

44:43.480 --> 44:46.620
- Will 'ee tell Caroline?
- To what purpose?

44:46.800 --> 44:49.064
We don't know where Ross is,

44:49.240 --> 44:52.619
if he even reached the prison
or found Dwight alive.

44:52.800 --> 44:55.507
Let alone 'soaped again.

45:07.120 --> 45:08.587
You've been at it hours, Ross.

45:08.760 --> 45:10.739
Take a rest!

45:11.560 --> 45:13.425
It won't bring him back!

45:13.600 --> 45:17.297
- Allow me. We're not out of danger yet.
- No let-up!

45:17.480 --> 45:19.345
We must get to Roscoff before dark.

45:19.520 --> 45:22.785
- The One And All sails on the evening tide.
- We'll never do it!

45:22.960 --> 45:26.145
We must!
Or we're trapped in Roscoff for a fortnight!

45:26.320 --> 45:28.424
Drake won't last a fortnight. He won't last a day.

45:28.600 --> 45:30.306
Nor will you!

45:31.080 --> 45:32.820
His fever's worsening.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.742
Unless I can clean the wound soon,
it's likely to become infected.

45:35.920 --> 45:37.899
And then he's done for.

45:57.760 --> 45:59.421
(l/l/a/ilng echoes)

46:00.560 --> 46:02.346
Ross. Ross.

46:05.240 --> 46:07.185
O4ROU/VE: You
let
him die.

46:08.600 --> 46:11.945
- You let him die!
DEMELZA: You're a disgrace!

46:12.120 --> 46:16.341
Selﬁsh, va/ng/orious, reckless.

46:16.520 --> 46:19.102
GEORGE: One can only agree.

46:19.280 --> 46:22.545
You are the most despicable of men.

46:22.720 --> 46:26.304
DEMELZ4: Ross! Ross!

46:26.480 --> 46:28.459
THOLLY: She's still there!

46:29.680 --> 46:31.386
She's still there!

46:33.200 --> 46:34.781
At anchor, waitin' for us!

46:34.960 --> 46:37.861
If we make haste, we'll catch her before she sail.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.985
Come on! Heave!

46:41.000 --> 46:42.422
Heave!

46:42.920 --> 46:44.023
Heave!

47:20.680 --> 47:24.309
I have a confession to make.

47:29.120 --> 47:31.782
When we left Henshawe...

47:32.760 --> 47:34.739
...he was not dead.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.343
He was dying. He could not live an hour.

47:43.000 --> 47:46.697
But in that hour, I knew that unless I lied,
you would willingly die alongside him.

47:46.880 --> 47:48.620
And that I could not permit.

47:55.280 --> 48:00.263
But, Drake? I think you will have
one less life on your conscience.

48:01.960 --> 48:04.064
Ross, I haven't yet thanked you.

48:05.800 --> 48:10.305
When you first appeared,
I thought you were a figment of my imagination.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.101
Hardly surprising.

48:14.120 --> 48:16.680
I must have been the last person
you expected to see.

48:16.840 --> 48:20.537
In truth, I expected to die where I stood...

48:21.560 --> 48:23.699
...surrounded by men I was unable to save.

48:23.880 --> 48:24.983
Now?

48:28.960 --> 48:36.958
Already I see that I must keep myself occupied
or I shall begin to ask the impossible question.

48:39.320 --> 48:40.423
Which?

48:43.520 --> 48:45.499
Why am I here and they're not?

49:06.560 --> 49:09.267
The cove. Nampara Cove.

49:25.560 --> 49:27.346
Ross!

49:35.560 --> 49:38.302
- (Groans softly)
- See, brother? My prayers did work!

49:38.480 --> 49:41.187
Judas! What happened?

49:41.360 --> 49:43.339
Nothing, sister. 'Tis a scratch.

49:44.440 --> 49:47.864
- He'll need rest and warm.
- We'll bring 'im up to the house.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.143
Dwight!

49:50.000 --> 49:53.219
Dwight, they brought you home!
(Laughs with relief)

49:58.920 --> 50:00.103
An' Zaclq!

50:00.280 --> 50:02.498
To see 'ee safe an' well. I never dared hope.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.898
We're more'n grateful to be here!

50:05.520 --> 50:07.499
I don' know this gentleman.

50:07.680 --> 50:12.424
Lieutenant Hugh Armitage at your service,
ma'am. Captain Poldark was my saviour too.

50:12.600 --> 50:15.865
Then this means it was a success.
You all returned home.

50:18.760 --> 50:19.863
No.

50:20.800 --> 50:22.017
Not all.

50:43.400 --> 50:44.867
Cap'n Henshawe?

50:49.320 --> 50:51.106
(SObs)

51:15.680 --> 51:17.068
Prudie!

51:17.240 --> 51:19.185
Make ready two beds.

51:19.360 --> 51:22.864
- One for Drake, one for Dr Enys.
- 'Tis done already. Ole Prudie'll see 'em right.

51:23.040 --> 51:24.587
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in.

51:29.640 --> 51:32.200
Beggin' your pardon, sir.

51:32.360 --> 51:37.582
I thought 'ee'd wish to know.
The One And All returned from France.

51:37.760 --> 51:41.059
An' Ross Poldark with her.

51:42.840 --> 51:44.626
Dr Enys was saved.

51:44.800 --> 51:47.826
- As expected.
- Any casualties?

51:48.000 --> 51:50.184
One wounded. One dead.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.987
Cap'n Henshawe from the mine.

51:53.520 --> 51:57.627
The mission can hardly be deemed a success,
to liberate one man at the expense of another.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.667
'Twas reckon'd a success,
for up to 20 men also 'soaped,

52:01.320 --> 52:03.379
one of 'em a person of great importance,

52:03.560 --> 52:06.905
a...Lieutenant Armitage?

52:08.120 --> 52:10.099
Lieutenant Hugh Armitage?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.184
Yes, ma'am, I think that was the name.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.199
You may go.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.669
You know Lieutenant Armitage?

52:20.840 --> 52:22.819
Only by name.

52:25.200 --> 52:27.862
He's the nephew of Lord Falmouth.

52:35.640 --> 52:37.904
Scurw has not enhanced my looks.

52:42.120 --> 52:46.819
I must beg a week of Demelza's care
before I let Caroline know I'm here.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.979
I think it may be too late for that.

52:49.920 --> 52:51.899
(Hammering on door)

52:52.880 --> 52:54.268
BUTLER: This way, please.

52:58.720 --> 53:01.063
Do you feel strong enough for a small surprise?

53:17.320 --> 53:19.106
...do I detect scorbutus?

53:21.040 --> 53:22.860
I... I'm afraid so.

53:24.440 --> 53:27.147
Well then, I prescribe fresh air, oranges...

53:28.160 --> 53:30.139
...and kisses without end.

53:47.560 --> 53:49.585
Sleep'll do him powerful good.

53:53.000 --> 53:54.979
Still think he's a pest?

53:56.200 --> 53:57.303
Yes.

53:58.840 --> 54:01.946
But a brave and fearless pest
who may have saved my life.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.299
He has something of your spirit.

54:07.360 --> 54:09.419
I suppose I must learn to love him too.

54:24.480 --> 54:31.420
DEMELZA:
Greater love hath no man

54:31.600 --> 54:38.824
ALL:
Than he who for his friend lay down his life

54:40.120 --> 54:48.118
SAM: And his name shall be forever beloved

54:48.320 --> 54:56.318
ALL: And his sacrifice forever praised

55:00.000 --> 55:06.018
SAM & DEMELZA:
Though we may no longer behold him

55:06.200 --> 55:14.027
ALL: In our hearts he liveth on

55:14.200 --> 55:20.184
And the light may grow dark

55:21.080 --> 55:29.078
Yet time will hold a flame forever more

55:32.360 --> 55:34.339
(Stifled sobs)

55:52.160 --> 55:54.720
I should never have let him come.

55:54.880 --> 55:58.384
- I should have foreseen the consequences.
- How could you?

55:58.560 --> 56:01.222
How _can we ever foresee
what Will come of our actions?

56:01.400 --> 56:03.300
HUGH ARMITAGE: I agree.

56:06.000 --> 56:08.821
How could I foresee a month ago
that today I'd be a free man?

56:11.160 --> 56:16.666
How could your husband foresee that in freeing
his friend, he'd liberate a man he'd never met?

56:18.800 --> 56:24.545
Well, I hope that whatever consequence come
of this liberty, you'll take full advantage of it.

56:24.720 --> 56:28.383
Believe me, ma'am, I intend to.
