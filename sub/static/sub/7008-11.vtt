00:06.871 --> 00:10.205
Merry Christmas and welcome
to <i>Tool Time</i>. We're live on Al's rooftop.

00:10.275 --> 00:12.835
Now, here's the star of the show,
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor.

00:13.878 --> 00:17.576
Thank you, Heidi. I am Tim...
Well, "The Yule Man" Taylor.

00:17.649 --> 00:19.287
And, of course,
you all know my assistant,

00:19.317 --> 00:23.277
Al "Be Home for Christmas
Just Like Every Other Night" Borland.

00:25.823 --> 00:27.143
Well, today, we're gonna show you

00:27.191 --> 00:30.025
the proper way of putting up
Christmas lights on your roof.

00:30.161 --> 00:34.531
- Heidi here's installing a GFI outlet.
- A GFI is a ground fault interrupter.

00:34.632 --> 00:37.864
It prevents people from being shocked,
something I know an awful lot about.

00:38.636 --> 00:42.129
Now, I've already done the wiring.
I brought the conduit in from the attic.

00:42.307 --> 00:44.833
Make sure that the lighting strands
and the extension cords

00:44.909 --> 00:48.744
are heavy-duty UL-approved
and marked for outdoor use.

00:48.813 --> 00:50.051
That prevents electrical fires,

00:50.081 --> 00:52.812
something else
I know an awful lot about.

00:53.151 --> 00:56.315
That's right. And Al and I have taken
the ultimate safety precaution.

00:56.387 --> 00:59.221
We're not allowing Tim
to do any of the work.

01:04.762 --> 01:08.199
Anyway, I'm especially excited
about decorating this year.

01:08.266 --> 01:11.031
This is my first Christmas
in my new house.

01:11.102 --> 01:14.436
Actually, it isn't your house. He rents it
from me, so it would be my house.

01:14.672 --> 01:15.833
Well, technically, I...

01:15.907 --> 01:19.400
Technically, the windows are mine,
the roof is mine, the house is mine.

01:19.477 --> 01:21.605
Getting into the holiday spirit early,
I see.

01:21.679 --> 01:24.581
Yes. Windows, bathtub, sinks, faucets.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.982
Mine, mine, mine, mine.
Aren't they, Al?

01:27.051 --> 01:28.212
Mine, mine, mine...

01:28.286 --> 01:30.118
Well, this actually is
my first Christmas...

01:30.188 --> 01:33.317
- Mine, mine, mine!
- In Tim's neighborhood,

01:33.624 --> 01:36.788
which makes me eligible
for the annual lighting contest.

01:37.762 --> 01:39.424
I'm shaking in my Sorels!

01:40.765 --> 01:43.098
But in the spirit of healthy competition,

01:43.167 --> 01:46.262
I've decided to give Al some
of my cool decorations from last year.

01:46.337 --> 01:48.203
- Well, thank you, Tim.
- It's nothing.

01:48.373 --> 01:49.397
I'll say.

01:49.841 --> 01:52.401
We got some tangled lights

01:55.880 --> 01:57.439
and a melted elf.

01:58.516 --> 02:01.247
Well, actually,
he prefers melted little person.

02:02.220 --> 02:04.246
Speaking of melted things,
we'll be right back

02:04.322 --> 02:06.848
after these words
from Saginaw Cheese.

02:07.024 --> 02:08.856
Cheese, it's good!

02:11.029 --> 02:12.029
<i>We're clear!</i>

02:12.096 --> 02:15.191
All right, everybody. Look, I need two...
Thank you, Milton. All right.

02:15.266 --> 02:17.701
Wendy, would you get
some powder up here on Al's nose?

02:17.769 --> 02:19.431
He looks like a glazed donut.

02:20.505 --> 02:23.873
Well, Tim, I'm not gonna
need your throwaway decorations.

02:23.941 --> 02:25.705
I'm gonna win with my own.

02:25.777 --> 02:28.474
Al, I've seen your Christmas bonus.
I don't think so.

02:29.113 --> 02:31.810
I may not have as much money
as you do for decorations,

02:31.883 --> 02:34.318
- but I have a partner.
- A partner?

02:34.552 --> 02:36.987
- Hello.
- Hey, Trudy!

02:37.221 --> 02:39.452
- Your girlfriend's your partner?
- Yes, she is.

02:39.524 --> 02:40.524
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:40.925 --> 02:44.362
The rest of the decorations
have arrived and they're really cute.

02:44.429 --> 02:47.092
In this competition,
cute doesn't cut it, sister.

02:47.298 --> 02:51.326
- I think we'll be fine.
- Wow. What is that?

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:03.414 --> 03:06.782
Hey, Mrs. Borland.
That red's so slimming on you.

03:57.535 --> 04:00.562
Okay, we got the graham crackers
for the window shutters,

04:00.638 --> 04:02.800
and the licorice for the gutters.

04:02.907 --> 04:05.638
I just need those Red Hots
for the doorknobs.

04:06.043 --> 04:08.308
Where are they?
They used to be right here.

04:08.446 --> 04:09.607
Here. Hide the box.

04:10.781 --> 04:12.113
What are you doing?

04:13.084 --> 04:15.110
Taking candy
from his younger cousins.

04:15.186 --> 04:16.950
He should be ashamed of himself.

04:18.322 --> 04:19.880
Nice try, Cinnamon Breath.

04:19.957 --> 04:22.517
You should be ashamed of yourself
for selling out your brother.

04:22.627 --> 04:24.391
And yet, oddly, I feel great.

04:26.464 --> 04:28.626
Go to the store and get me some more.

04:28.866 --> 04:31.597
- Okay, now, where were we?
- Oh, no.

04:31.669 --> 04:35.538
- Claire put her shutters on backwards.
- I wanted to do it like Uncle Tim.

04:37.675 --> 04:40.235
- Good girl.
- Merry Christmas, everybody.

04:40.311 --> 04:42.837
- Hey.
- Look at our gingerbread house.

04:42.914 --> 04:44.041
Ta-da!

04:44.115 --> 04:46.675
- Who supervised the construction?
- I did.

04:46.751 --> 04:48.310
Who gave you your permits?

04:49.086 --> 04:52.853
- Mrs. Claus.
- Well, licorice gutters...

04:52.924 --> 04:55.894
That's not for the gutters,
it's supposed to be for the plumbing.

04:55.960 --> 04:57.724
I think maybe
I better get my hands on this.

04:57.828 --> 05:00.593
- No! We want it to last till Christmas.
- Why, you...

05:01.065 --> 05:05.196
No, no, no! Away!
So how did it go at Al's?

05:05.870 --> 05:07.498
Well, <i>Tool Time</i> was all right.

05:07.572 --> 05:10.599
Al has resorted to cheating
for the Christmas lighting contest.

05:10.675 --> 05:13.941
Oh, I wouldn't worry about it.
Al's not half the cheater you are.

05:18.015 --> 05:21.110
So you had your Christmas
with your mom this morning?

05:21.185 --> 05:23.711
- Yeah, we got lots of presents.
- Great.

05:23.788 --> 05:26.815
Aunt Jill, what do you like
most about Christmas?

05:27.024 --> 05:29.255
Well, I like the whole spirit
of the holiday.

05:29.594 --> 05:32.029
Peace on Earth, goodwill towards men.

05:32.096 --> 05:34.531
Borland's Santa's toast.

05:41.539 --> 05:44.270
- What is that?
- What does it look like?

05:44.342 --> 05:45.970
It's a wise man with a harpoon gun.

05:47.878 --> 05:49.847
'Tis the season to be packing.

05:52.950 --> 05:54.612
- Hey.
- Where have you guys been?

05:54.852 --> 05:57.754
Dad sent us over to Al's
to check out his roof decorations.

05:57.822 --> 06:00.189
See, I am so proud to spy for you
for Christmas,

06:00.257 --> 06:01.623
the holiest holiday of the year.

06:01.726 --> 06:03.627
Cut the crap. What did it look like?

06:04.562 --> 06:05.586
It's awesome.

06:05.663 --> 06:09.361
His nativity scene's more convincing
than the original.

06:10.201 --> 06:11.726
All right, here's the plan.

06:11.802 --> 06:14.237
Take Bobby Ram Dass,
put him on the roof and sight him in.

06:14.338 --> 06:15.338
All right?

06:16.140 --> 06:18.740
I'm gonna get some high-powered
binoculars and meet you out there.

06:19.710 --> 06:23.147
Okay, which one of you girls wants
to put the Christmas tree angel up?

06:25.149 --> 06:26.173
What's wrong?

06:26.250 --> 06:28.656
Are you scared to get up on the ladder?
I'll hold you up there.

06:28.686 --> 06:31.554
We always used to put the angel up
with Mommy and Daddy.

06:31.622 --> 06:32.954
And now they're fighting.

06:34.725 --> 06:36.023
I am so sorry.

06:36.861 --> 06:39.888
Look, I know that this must be awful
for you guys.

06:40.798 --> 06:42.169
But, you know,
there's one really good thing

06:42.199 --> 06:43.237
about your new arrangement,

06:43.267 --> 06:44.739
and that is you get to have
two Christmases.

06:44.769 --> 06:47.739
You get to have
two whole sets of presents.

06:48.439 --> 06:49.600
Oh, yeah.

06:51.142 --> 06:52.701
<i>Feliz Navidad</i>, everybody.

06:52.777 --> 06:55.144
- Hey! Hey! Hey!
- Randy!

06:56.580 --> 06:58.708
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:04.455 --> 07:06.185
What are you doing? Oh, my God!

07:06.257 --> 07:08.886
- I sent all your presents to Costa Rica!
- That's all right.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.325
How did you get here?

07:10.461 --> 07:12.300
Well, you know,
Lauren had some extra bonus miles,

07:12.330 --> 07:14.535
and I thought, "I can't spend Christmas
without my mom and dad."

07:14.565 --> 07:15.863
Yeah! Huh?

07:15.933 --> 07:19.062
He gets to spend Christmas
with his mom and dad?

07:19.503 --> 07:20.732
Claire!

07:21.639 --> 07:23.005
I'll be right back.

07:24.942 --> 07:27.173
This is their first Christmas
since the separation,

07:27.244 --> 07:29.543
and they're not really taking it that well.

07:29.914 --> 07:30.938
But you're looking great.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.177
You gotta get out here.
Baby Jesus is smoking.

07:35.186 --> 07:36.347
I'll be right back.

07:36.420 --> 07:38.459
- Look, Randy's here.
- Hey, Randy, what's going on?

07:38.489 --> 07:40.321
- Brad!
- I'll catch you later, man.

07:42.693 --> 07:46.152
- Hey, Randy, I heard you were back.
- Mark, grab the fire extinguisher!

07:49.433 --> 07:51.925
- Bye.
- Okay.

07:52.470 --> 07:55.963
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas to you, too, Randy.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.906
Have a cookie. Don't mind if I do.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.539
Oh, my God!

08:08.385 --> 08:11.355
Randy, I thought I told you
that Mark and Brad

08:12.256 --> 08:13.256
are pigs.

08:14.458 --> 08:18.088
The family I'm staying with has pigs,
and believe me, they're a lot neater.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.690
Well, I know the conditions aren't ideal,

08:21.766 --> 08:25.032
but at least you'll get to bond
with your brothers.

08:26.237 --> 08:29.002
Yeah, I'm just a little afraid
of what we'll be bonding with.

08:29.106 --> 08:30.438
Oh, God!

08:32.342 --> 08:35.905
Well, if it gets really bad,
you can crash on the couch upstairs.

08:35.980 --> 08:37.642
Mom, Grandma's on the phone.

08:38.048 --> 08:40.381
Guys, will you clean up
this pigsty now?

08:40.451 --> 08:42.010
Yeah. We'll get right on it.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.390
Man, that was awesome
what you did to Dad on the roof.

08:49.460 --> 08:52.225
Gosh, you nailed him
with that fire extinguisher.

08:52.296 --> 08:54.663
- Thanks.
- Yeah. How'd you get Dad?

08:54.765 --> 08:56.597
Oh, you're not gonna
believe this, Randy.

08:56.667 --> 09:00.126
First, he snuck up behind Dad, right?
And then, he...

09:01.639 --> 09:03.198
And then, Dad...

09:05.309 --> 09:07.278
Oh, man, that was funny.

09:09.313 --> 09:14.274
- Well, I guess you had to be there.
- So how's Puerto Rico?

09:18.656 --> 09:20.022
Costa Rica.

09:21.992 --> 09:24.291
Then, I guess you didn't get my letters.

09:27.031 --> 09:30.468
Oh, you know what we should do?
We should turn the lights out tonight

09:30.534 --> 09:32.606
at the same time,
so Dad thinks he's blown a circuit.

09:32.636 --> 09:35.731
Oh, yeah. That would get him back
for making us spy on Al.

09:35.806 --> 09:36.933
Yeah.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.310
Hey, guys,
where's my good sports coat?

09:39.410 --> 09:41.072
I need it for church tonight.

09:41.145 --> 09:45.310
- I think it's over there.
- It's a little wrinkled.

09:47.751 --> 09:48.912
A little wrinkled?

09:49.019 --> 09:51.386
It looks like the oldest lady
in our village.

09:54.792 --> 09:56.818
Wipe your feet off, everybody.

09:56.894 --> 10:00.228
Oh, that was a wonderful service.

10:00.297 --> 10:02.789
What did everybody think
about the sermon?

10:02.933 --> 10:04.561
I thought it was too short.

10:04.635 --> 10:06.365
I could have used another half hour.

10:07.738 --> 10:10.674
You were gone during the sermon.
Where were you?

10:11.408 --> 10:14.173
I was in the sacristy,
having a moment of private prayer.

10:14.278 --> 10:15.278
Oh.

10:16.113 --> 10:18.810
Did you pray for a chili cheese dog?

10:21.919 --> 10:23.387
My prayers were answered.

10:24.622 --> 10:26.181
Hey, everybody,
gather around the tree.

10:26.257 --> 10:28.017
It's Christmas Eve.
We get to open a present.

10:28.058 --> 10:30.027
- All right!
- Oh, here. Open mine.

10:30.127 --> 10:31.687
I got everyone
something really special.

10:31.729 --> 10:33.400
Do you mind
if the girls open theirs first?

10:33.430 --> 10:35.236
- I promised them they could do that.
- No, that's fine.

10:35.266 --> 10:37.997
- All right. All right, girls.
- And then off to bed.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.135
- Toolboxes?
- Cool.

10:42.273 --> 10:44.765
They're from
the Little Miss Binford collection.

10:44.842 --> 10:47.402
- Thanks, Uncle Tim.
- Merry Christmas, you guys.

10:48.012 --> 10:51.642
- Okay, okay, off to bed.
- I don't want to go to bed.

10:51.715 --> 10:53.479
Can I bring my toolbox?

10:54.051 --> 10:55.322
No, no, no. You take them upstairs,

10:55.352 --> 10:57.321
you'll start hitting each other
in the head.

10:57.421 --> 10:59.322
Save that for Christmas morning.

10:59.390 --> 11:01.689
Can Aunt Jill read us a bedtime story?

11:01.926 --> 11:03.451
Oh, I can do even better than that.

11:03.527 --> 11:06.190
I can tell you a story
about Christmas when I was a little girl.

11:06.263 --> 11:07.629
No, thank you.

11:10.768 --> 11:13.328
They get smarter every year.
Don't wait for me.

11:13.404 --> 11:14.565
Be up in a minute!

11:14.672 --> 11:18.632
It's a pity those poor girls
can't have their whole family together.

11:19.176 --> 11:21.441
Oh, Ma, please. Don't start.

11:21.679 --> 11:25.172
- Don't use that tone with Mother.
- There was no tone.

11:25.249 --> 11:26.581
- Tone.
- There was no tone!

11:26.650 --> 11:30.018
- Tim, what do you think?
- I think all these wrenches are metric.

11:31.755 --> 11:34.122
All I'm saying, Marty,
is that it's a shame

11:34.191 --> 11:37.423
that you couldn't have worked
something out, at least for the holidays.

11:37.494 --> 11:38.621
Right, Tim?

11:39.096 --> 11:41.190
I wonder how big my head is in metric?

11:43.033 --> 11:44.865
Look, Nancy's the one
who's being impossible.

11:44.935 --> 11:46.535
And there's nothing I can do about that.

11:46.570 --> 11:48.664
And so, to compensate
for your inadequacy,

11:48.739 --> 11:51.504
you lash out at the woman
who gave you life.

11:51.575 --> 11:54.044
You should be ashamed.
Shouldn't he, Tim?

11:56.013 --> 11:58.482
That's one sizable melon.
Look at that baby, huh?

11:59.116 --> 12:01.221
Look, guys, why don't we just open up
some more gifts, huh?

12:01.251 --> 12:03.482
- There's a good idea. Yeah.
- Here, open mine.

12:04.588 --> 12:05.647
Look at this.

12:05.723 --> 12:10.058
It's to "Mom, Dad, Brad, Mark,
Uncle Marty, Uncle Jeff and Grandma."

12:10.661 --> 12:13.290
Lot of people to be fitting
in a little box like that.

12:13.364 --> 12:14.855
Dehydrated sea monkeys?

12:18.635 --> 12:19.635
Okay.

12:20.371 --> 12:23.136
Cards. And on the card,

12:23.374 --> 12:27.436
"A tree in Cabo Blanco rainforest
is being protected in your name."

12:27.511 --> 12:29.980
So later on, we can go down
and cut it down, huh?

12:32.149 --> 12:33.208
Great gift.

12:33.283 --> 12:35.443
You know, Uncle Marty,
I only put your name on the card

12:35.486 --> 12:36.647
instead of yours and Nancy's.

12:36.720 --> 12:37.779
I hope that's all right.

12:37.855 --> 12:40.518
Nancy might get the house,
but you hang on to that tree.

12:43.861 --> 12:44.885
Oh!

12:44.962 --> 12:48.023
- Those poor, poor girls.
- Mom, stop.

12:48.098 --> 12:49.770
It's my fault.
I shouldn't have brought it up.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.531
It's nobody's fault. Come on.
Let's open some more gifts.

12:52.636 --> 12:54.161
- What about that?
- Yeah. Open ours.

12:54.271 --> 12:55.637
All right, cool.

12:55.739 --> 12:59.267
Yo, Randy. Mark and I went in just
the two of us 'cause you weren't here.

12:59.943 --> 13:02.913
You guys went all out on
the wrapping paper again, didn't you?

13:04.214 --> 13:05.944
A chasing light set. This is great.

13:06.016 --> 13:09.646
- Yeah, for the manger on the roof.
- However, there's no lights in the box.

13:09.853 --> 13:11.413
That's because
they're already up there.

13:11.455 --> 13:12.514
No way!

13:12.589 --> 13:15.081
You turn those babies on,
it's gonna be a <i>Disco Inferno.</i>

13:15.159 --> 13:17.685
Silent night fever! I like it.

13:17.761 --> 13:19.525
I'm gonna go check it out. Come on!

13:19.596 --> 13:21.035
You guys want to come out
and check out the lights?

13:21.065 --> 13:23.193
Come on. Come on, everybody.
Come on, Mom.

13:23.267 --> 13:24.963
Very nice.

13:36.880 --> 13:40.612
If I'm gentle with this harpoon,
I think I can save the buttocks.

13:42.886 --> 13:46.653
What kind of sick individual
would do this to Santa's little helper?

13:52.463 --> 13:54.591
Just a scosh to the right, Balthazar.

13:59.937 --> 14:02.668
- Merry Christmas, Mom.
- Merry Christmas, honey.

14:02.973 --> 14:04.339
- You want some coffee?
- Yeah.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.742
Gosh, I'm so glad you came up early.

14:07.978 --> 14:11.073
- We've hardly had a chance to talk.
- Yeah, I know.

14:11.615 --> 14:13.982
Things have been
a little crazy around here.

14:14.918 --> 14:16.819
So what's going on with you?

14:17.254 --> 14:20.747
Well, you know, a lot of things.
I'm working on this new program...

14:20.824 --> 14:22.656
- It's Christmas!
- Let's open presents!

14:22.759 --> 14:24.785
Only yours. Nobody else's.

14:25.028 --> 14:26.792
Good morning.
Merry Christmas, etcetera...

14:26.864 --> 14:28.230
Good morning. Merry Christmas.

14:28.332 --> 14:31.769
So, anyway, this program is
where we take these trees and we...

14:31.835 --> 14:33.895
- Okay. Merry Christmas!
- Merry Christmas.

14:33.971 --> 14:35.837
- Hey!
- Merry Christmas!

14:36.306 --> 14:39.640
- Hey, the girls want to open presents.
- Oh, those blue packages are from me.

14:39.777 --> 14:42.508
- Yeah. And me.
- What'd you get them?

14:42.713 --> 14:44.375
I'll let you know in a minute.

14:47.151 --> 14:49.450
I hope you didn't
let your mom buy Carrie's present.

14:49.519 --> 14:52.011
No. I buy the presents for my girlfriend.

14:52.356 --> 14:55.383
Besides, I wouldn't want Mom
walking into that kind of store.

14:57.361 --> 14:58.795
Come on, Aunt Jill.

14:58.862 --> 15:01.491
Oh, they don't want to open presents
without you.

15:01.565 --> 15:03.932
- It's all right. We'll talk later.
- All right.

15:06.703 --> 15:09.263
You'd think a Santa that big
would be easier to hit.

15:10.741 --> 15:13.575
Al's gonna blow you out
of this competition, isn't he?

15:13.644 --> 15:17.012
Perhaps, if he wants to get
all competitive about it.

15:17.447 --> 15:20.611
But for me, Christmas is
more of a religious holiday, Marty.

15:46.276 --> 15:49.576
No, no, no.
I'm roasting chestnuts on an open fire.

15:50.414 --> 15:53.714
And might I wish you
a Merry Christmas, Randy?

15:54.384 --> 15:57.946
Well, Wilson, you can wish
all you want, it won't make it come true.

15:58.655 --> 16:01.215
- Noel not going so well?
- No.

16:02.659 --> 16:06.494
I had this great picture of what it would
be like coming home for Christmas,

16:07.231 --> 16:09.200
so far it hasn't been like that at all.

16:09.266 --> 16:10.894
Well, things are bound to be different

16:10.968 --> 16:13.028
with Marty and the twins
living in the house.

16:13.103 --> 16:14.264
It's not that.

16:14.738 --> 16:17.833
It's just ever since I got home,
I just feel like I don't fit anymore.

16:17.908 --> 16:18.967
In what way?

16:19.409 --> 16:21.776
You know, everyone's so busy
doing their own thing.

16:21.878 --> 16:24.143
I mean, no one cares about
what's going on with me.

16:24.248 --> 16:26.740
Every time I say something,
they look at me like I'm from Mars.

16:26.817 --> 16:28.149
Been there.

16:32.022 --> 16:35.857
I guess it's like Thomas Wolfe
wrote, <i>You Can't Go Home Again.</i>

16:35.926 --> 16:37.292
Well, that's very good, Randy,

16:37.394 --> 16:40.057
but Frank Baum wrote,
"There's no place like home."

16:41.665 --> 16:45.158
- What do you think?
- Well, I think you can go home again

16:45.235 --> 16:48.763
as long as you realize you may not be
coming home to the same home.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.603
Yeah, I mean, that makes sense.

16:51.141 --> 16:54.077
I mean, why did I think
time would just stand still?

16:54.211 --> 16:56.146
You know, I've often wondered
the same thing.

16:56.280 --> 16:57.718
I've got a machine
down in my basement

16:57.748 --> 17:01.082
that can slow it down,
but I just can't make it stop!

17:04.387 --> 17:07.358
Wilson, why did I even want things
to stay the same?

17:07.457 --> 17:09.618
Well, Randy,
as you venture out on your own,

17:09.726 --> 17:11.661
it's only natural for you
to want home to be

17:11.728 --> 17:13.788
the same secure place
that you left behind.

17:13.964 --> 17:16.798
Wilson, I just want someone
to notice that I'm here.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.771
You know, I could go all the way back
to Costa Rica

17:18.801 --> 17:20.808
without ever getting a chance
to talk to my mom and dad.

17:20.838 --> 17:23.740
Well, you can't let that happen, now.
You have to find an opening.

17:23.807 --> 17:27.175
Let your voice be heard.
Sing, "Hallelujah!"

17:27.277 --> 17:30.770
<i>Go Tell It on the Mountain!
Blow your Trumpet, Gabriel!</i>

17:30.881 --> 17:34.215
- Remember the Alamo!
- Wilson? I get the point.

17:36.119 --> 17:37.212
- Thanks.
- Right.

17:37.287 --> 17:40.018
And, Randy, thank you for buying me
that tree in Costa Rica.

17:40.123 --> 17:41.887
- Oh, you like it?
- Oh, I love it.

17:41.958 --> 17:44.325
I can hardly wait to go down there
and climb it.

17:44.561 --> 17:47.861
Well, you might want to wait awhile.
It's only three inches tall.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.228
Heads up.

17:54.504 --> 17:55.802
I got it, Dad!

17:57.774 --> 17:58.912
What were you talking
to Wilson about?

17:58.942 --> 18:00.103
His nuts.

18:03.847 --> 18:06.112
Well, it looks like
one of your guys went AWOL.

18:06.183 --> 18:07.310
Second time today.

18:07.784 --> 18:10.015
You working for Borland?
Answer me, soldier!

18:13.256 --> 18:15.623
- So anything I can help with?
- Yeah, yeah.

18:16.159 --> 18:18.719
Fuse went out on one
of Santa's little bodyguards.

18:18.795 --> 18:20.957
You gotta go in
through his armpit there.

18:22.165 --> 18:23.189
There you go.

18:23.767 --> 18:25.793
So tell me a little bit about Costa Rica.

18:25.869 --> 18:27.030
Well, it's cool.

18:27.104 --> 18:28.775
Come on, "It's cool."
Give me more information than that.

18:28.805 --> 18:30.967
- Do you still like living with that family?
- Yeah.

18:31.074 --> 18:34.135
You know, it's a little weird living
with a strange family,

18:34.211 --> 18:37.079
but, you know, it helps
that I come from a strange family.

18:38.081 --> 18:40.243
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, honey. Watch your step there.

18:40.350 --> 18:43.081
Okay. I brought up
some hot chocolate for you.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.180
Remember that time
that we went camping

18:46.289 --> 18:48.758
and I made it with melted candy bars
and toothpaste?

18:49.459 --> 18:50.927
I didn't make it that way.

18:51.962 --> 18:53.521
So what are you guys doing?

18:54.297 --> 18:57.597
- We're talking about Costa Rica.
- Yeah? So?

18:57.701 --> 19:00.603
- You still love it there, honey?
- Yeah. It's great.

19:01.071 --> 19:02.175
It's just kind of funny, you know.

19:02.205 --> 19:05.835
Every time Lauren and I get together,
all we seem to talk about is home.

19:07.010 --> 19:08.672
You probably miss <i>Tool Time.</i>

19:09.846 --> 19:13.977
You know, I miss my friends.
I miss writing for the school paper.

19:14.351 --> 19:16.911
I miss Arnold Schwarzenegger movies
in English.

19:18.688 --> 19:21.453
How do they say <i>"Hasta la vista, baby"</i>
in Spanish?

19:27.564 --> 19:31.126
You know what I also miss? That
Chinese-food place we used to go to.

19:31.201 --> 19:32.239
- What was that?
- Fu Wong's?

19:32.269 --> 19:33.737
Yeah. Fu Wong's.

19:33.837 --> 19:35.499
- Fu Wong's closed.
- That's right.

19:35.639 --> 19:38.302
What's it now?
It's Tanaka's Sushi and Live Bait.

19:43.246 --> 19:44.475
Good.

19:51.488 --> 19:54.253
Gosh, you know,
home is definitely not the same home.

19:54.558 --> 19:56.459
Come on.
Things haven't changed that much.

19:56.893 --> 19:59.260
Dad, come on.
Things have definitely changed.

19:59.329 --> 20:00.854
I mean, Tanaka?

20:01.031 --> 20:03.203
You know, we've got three new people
living in the house.

20:03.233 --> 20:05.202
Mark's, like, five inches taller.

20:05.302 --> 20:07.237
Brad and him are actually
getting along.

20:07.304 --> 20:10.866
- I just feel like a guest at a hotel.
- With armed bellhops.

20:14.878 --> 20:16.583
You feel like an outsider
at this house now?

20:16.613 --> 20:18.980
Well, we haven't been much help,
you know.

20:19.049 --> 20:22.417
- We've hardly spent any time with him.
- It's not your fault.

20:22.686 --> 20:24.848
You guys are just getting on
with your lives,

20:24.955 --> 20:26.583
and I'm having trouble keeping in step.

20:26.656 --> 20:29.387
Well, Randy,
regardless of who's living in your room,

20:29.459 --> 20:32.224
or what's growing in there,

20:34.865 --> 20:36.800
this is always gonna be your home.

20:37.734 --> 20:39.100
Thanks, Mom.

20:39.803 --> 20:41.475
I guess since your dad and I
are living here

20:41.505 --> 20:45.033
in the middle of all these changes,
we haven't even noticed half of them.

20:49.479 --> 20:50.538
It's okay.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.942
The ground seems
to have broken my fall.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.291
Then again,
some things never change.

21:15.238 --> 21:17.798
Wow, what an awesome
lighting display.

21:18.074 --> 21:20.305
Yeah. Those figures look so lifelike.

21:20.977 --> 21:23.003
At least now we know why Al won.

21:23.079 --> 21:26.447
Yeah, it's amazing what a little blood,
sweat and 10 grand will do.

21:28.385 --> 21:30.286
Maybe next year, honey.

21:33.356 --> 21:34.688
They're gone.

21:35.025 --> 21:38.120
- Now can we get down from here?
- Yeah, I think so.

21:38.261 --> 21:41.789
Oh, no. My feet are frozen to the roof.
Help me, Al.

21:42.599 --> 21:46.127
- I can't. I'm stuck in the chimney.
- What are we gonna do?

21:47.971 --> 21:51.032
- Help! Help!
- Help! Help!

21:51.107 --> 21:52.666
Over here!

21:56.179 --> 21:57.477
You know what I also miss?

21:57.547 --> 21:59.641
That Chinese restaurant
we used to go to.

21:59.716 --> 22:01.241
- Fong Wu's?
- Yeah.

22:01.384 --> 22:03.876
- Fong Wu's closed.
- Now it's Achmed's...

22:08.225 --> 22:09.225
They closed.

22:09.292 --> 22:12.262
Now it's Achmed's Falafel
and Discount Cigarettes.

22:17.000 --> 22:18.832
I'm trying so hard.
