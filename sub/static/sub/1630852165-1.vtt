02:07.375 --> 02:10.125
Vince Cross. Here to process Ruth Slater.

02:15.833 --> 02:18.166
[officer] Twenty. Forty.

02:29.541 --> 02:33.708
[Vince] The release plan. Read it.
It's how you stay out of here.

02:33.791 --> 02:36.583
Your Ten Commandments.
No drugs, drinking, bars, nightclubs.

02:36.666 --> 02:38.791
No firearms or any other weapons.

02:38.875 --> 02:41.750
You cannot associate with anyone
with a criminal record.

02:41.833 --> 02:43.125
No known felons.

02:44.708 --> 02:46.333
Vince Cross, open the door.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.000
-Questions so far?
-No.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.750
[gate buzzes]

02:59.750 --> 03:00.750
[cell phone chimes]

03:01.750 --> 03:03.375
[girl] Hey, Katherine, it's me.

03:03.458 --> 03:06.166
Can you please return Mom's calls
and get her off my back?

03:06.250 --> 03:09.625
I told her you've been deep in rehearsals,
but I can't keep that up--

03:20.208 --> 03:23.875
[Vince] Does your release alter the terms
of your no-contact order? Yes or no?

03:23.958 --> 03:24.791
No.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.500
[Vince] Can you reach out
to the victim's family? Yes or no?

03:27.583 --> 03:28.750
No.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.458
[Vince] Couple weeks
staring at the ceiling,

03:30.541 --> 03:32.583
people sometimes wanna make amends.

03:33.791 --> 03:35.000
I got nothin' to say.

03:38.625 --> 03:39.833

[cars crashing]

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
[gate buzzing]

04:40.125 --> 04:42.291
[Vince] The main thing
for success is a job.

04:43.125 --> 04:46.416
-You either have, or you're looking.
-Got a job. Carpentry.

04:47.500 --> 04:48.416
[Vince] Hmm.

04:49.000 --> 04:53.000
Well, if it doesn't pan out,
I got a friend in seafood packing.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.791
My man, Stan.
He takes my people on a trial basis.

04:56.958 --> 04:58.000
I'm good.

04:58.083 --> 04:59.625
Take the card.

05:01.000 --> 05:01.875
Take the card.

05:06.291 --> 05:09.208
Guess you think you got
this freedom thing all figured out, huh?

05:10.375 --> 05:12.583
[pensive music playing]

05:25.666 --> 05:27.750
[Katherine] The concussion
came from the airbag.

05:28.791 --> 05:32.000
But I'm fine. And nobody was hurt too bad.

05:32.083 --> 05:33.416
Except for you.

05:34.416 --> 05:35.750
Have you been taking your meds?

05:35.833 --> 05:37.916
-Yes, Dad. Jesus.
-Hey.

05:38.583 --> 05:39.666
[door opens]

05:42.125 --> 05:43.958
-Katherine.
-I'm sorry, Mom.

05:44.833 --> 05:46.208
You don't need to be sorry.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.583
-I didn't mean to freak you out.
-Don't worry.

05:50.708 --> 05:51.750
So what do we know?

05:51.833 --> 05:56.666
Oh. She's got a broken rib,
dislocated shoulder, and a concussion.

05:57.666 --> 06:00.958
When you get out of the hospital,
you need to come stay with us for a while.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.916
-No, Dad. I'm fine.
-I think that's a good idea.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.458
My recital's coming up.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.208
[dad] Well, we'll cross
that bridge when we come to it.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.041
You can practice at home.

06:12.083 --> 06:13.083
[sighs]

06:33.041 --> 06:34.041
[sighs]

06:34.125 --> 06:35.416
Welcome to your new home.

06:36.625 --> 06:41.041
You and I will meet here
every Tuesday, 11:00 a.m. without fail.

06:42.041 --> 06:43.125
Thanks for the ride.

07:01.375 --> 07:03.583
[woman 1] You sold my stuff!
I had to walk all the way downtown!

07:03.666 --> 07:04.958
[woman 2] I worked with you for months.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.958
-[woman 1] You're such a liar.
-You need to pay rent.

07:07.041 --> 07:09.750
-[woman 1] Think you're better than me?
-[woman 3] Ruth Slater?

07:09.833 --> 07:11.291
-Follow me.
-[woman 1] Fuck you!

07:11.833 --> 07:13.416
[woman 1 sobbing]

07:13.500 --> 07:16.041
The bus map. They're always late.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.375
House rules are simple.

07:18.458 --> 07:22.208
No fightin', stealin',
destroying property.

07:22.291 --> 07:23.333
[woman 4] Come on, get up.

07:23.416 --> 07:26.250
Shower. Ten minutes.

07:26.333 --> 07:29.958
-Everything else, use your common sense.
-[woman yelling]

07:30.666 --> 07:33.541
-[woman 5] How about a knock?
-Val, you know the rules.

07:34.500 --> 07:38.541
Ladies. Your new roommate, Ruth.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.791
You can all introduce yourselves.

07:43.708 --> 07:45.291
I'll let you get settled in.

07:55.166 --> 07:58.000
-[machines whirring]
-[water spaying]

08:01.583 --> 08:02.583
Hey, dickhead.

08:13.291 --> 08:14.875
We're gonna just let this go?

08:15.750 --> 08:16.958
Twenty years of Dad's life,

08:17.041 --> 08:20.083
and this bitch
gets out early for good behavior?

08:20.166 --> 08:23.291
What is that?
You think Dad would want that?

08:23.375 --> 08:25.583
How do I know what Dad would want, Keith?

08:31.083 --> 08:33.458
What is it? Stress, huh?

08:34.125 --> 08:35.708
Doc's put me back on something.

08:36.625 --> 08:37.791
It'll go away.

08:41.125 --> 08:42.166
[man] Hey.

08:43.250 --> 08:44.916
There's nothing we can do about it anyway.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.625
I'm thinking you and me,
couple of baseball bats.

08:48.708 --> 08:49.958
[scoffs]

08:50.041 --> 08:52.416
Yeah, that'd solve
all our problems, and then what?

08:53.416 --> 08:54.500
Come on, man.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.375
I drove to Purdy.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.333
And I watched that bitch walk out.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.541
Hey, you need to leave this alone.

09:06.541 --> 09:08.000
You're not with me on this?

09:10.166 --> 09:12.125
No, I'm not with you.
I got a family. I got a kid.

09:12.208 --> 09:13.666
She's living in Chinatown.

09:13.750 --> 09:14.750
Hey.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.875
-But what about Dad?
-Now, look.

09:20.041 --> 09:21.583
You need to leave this alone.

09:24.708 --> 09:25.708
[laughing]

09:28.916 --> 09:30.041
[cat meowing in video]

09:35.958 --> 09:37.208
-[dad] Hey.
-[mom] Hmm.

09:41.458 --> 09:45.291
I don't know if it's my state of mind,
but these papers are worse than ever.

09:46.250 --> 09:48.375
-[dad] Lord of the Flies?
-[mom] Mmm-hmm.

09:48.458 --> 09:52.875
This student is writing about
how Piggy was made into an "escape goat."

10:05.125 --> 10:08.000
They said she was drifting
before she ran the light.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.291
She was just distracted.

10:13.041 --> 10:16.583
It's… a coincidence?

10:16.666 --> 10:19.333
The release letter?
There's no way Katherine saw that.

10:20.041 --> 10:24.208
It's just… the same day.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.541
-What if she tries to find Katherine?
-She can't.

10:35.375 --> 10:36.833
And this was an accident.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.333
It has nothing to do with Ruth Slater.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.708
[man on TV speaking indistinctly]

10:57.416 --> 10:58.416
Slater. Phone call.

11:05.250 --> 11:06.250
Hello.

11:08.541 --> 11:10.375
-Hello?
-[heavy breathing over phone]

11:17.875 --> 11:19.083

11:36.750 --> 11:38.208
You don't touch my stuff.

11:39.000 --> 11:40.875
-You piece of shit.
-[groans]

11:44.166 --> 11:45.375
Get the fuck out.

12:12.750 --> 12:14.041
[woman] Keith?

[sighs]

12:32.625 --> 12:34.000
[volume increases]

12:35.125 --> 12:36.833
[woman 2] I don't know
if we're still going.

12:36.916 --> 12:38.500
[sighs] We need to get a sitter.

12:39.083 --> 12:41.291
What do you even get somebody
for their retirement?

12:41.958 --> 12:44.208
A fishing rod or something?

12:45.708 --> 12:47.041
Hold on. Steve.

12:48.375 --> 12:49.375
[baby coos]

12:51.541 --> 12:52.875
Daddy's going to work.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.541
Just so…

12:58.250 --> 12:59.666
[chuckles] Stupid, right? Like…

12:59.750 --> 13:01.125
[door opens]

13:02.166 --> 13:03.208
[door closes]

13:03.291 --> 13:04.291

[sighs]

13:24.250 --> 13:27.375
[uneasy music playing]

13:30.541 --> 13:32.791
[man] How many times do I have to
tell you it's not your property anymore.

13:32.875 --> 13:33.833
[Ruth] It's my fucking house!

13:33.916 --> 13:35.708
No, it's the bank's house now!

13:35.791 --> 13:37.875
You come to that door,
I swear to fucking God…

13:37.958 --> 13:39.041
[man] Swear to God what?

13:39.125 --> 13:42.208
Okay, I need you
to knock it down a notch or two.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.500
-What are you gonna do, Ruth, huh?
-[man 2] Katie in there?

13:46.291 --> 13:47.708
[man] What are you gonna do?

13:48.708 --> 13:49.625
[sighs]

13:50.291 --> 13:51.291
Ruth!

13:58.958 --> 14:00.791
[birds chirping]

14:01.916 --> 14:03.375
[woman] Whose idea was it?

14:06.083 --> 14:08.958
You can either tell me the truth,
or I'll find out. Your choice.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.375
[footsteps approaching]

14:14.416 --> 14:15.416
The ramp?

14:16.125 --> 14:18.333
All right. Well, you guys know my advice.

14:18.416 --> 14:20.541
-No outside counsel.
-[man] Got it.

14:22.458 --> 14:23.625
I did it.

14:24.833 --> 14:27.416
-How'd you do it, Ryan?
-I just did it.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.875
I dragged the wood over
and put it up on bricks.

14:29.958 --> 14:31.083
[man 2] Uh, Mrs. Ingram?

14:32.416 --> 14:33.666
-You're both grounded.
-[Ryan] What?

14:33.750 --> 14:35.291
-That's not fair.
-I said I did it.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.416
Those pieces of wood are 70 pounds each.
It's a two-man job.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.958
Mrs. Ingram,
you wanna take a look at this?

14:42.958 --> 14:43.875
[woman] Mmm.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.250
Creepy.

14:47.333 --> 14:50.958
People put baby shoes in walls
to protect them from evil spirits.

14:52.041 --> 14:54.583
Leave 'em in there.
Someone put 'em in there for a reason.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.083
Love y'all. [kisses]

14:57.250 --> 14:58.958
-[man] Bye, babe.
-[woman] Bye, babe.

14:59.458 --> 15:00.791

-[chuckles]

15:06.416 --> 15:07.416
[man chuckles]

15:07.500 --> 15:11.000
[woman] He totally loves her.
You don't know what you're talking about.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.083
They met on a beach in Maui.

15:15.583 --> 15:19.041
No, they were laughing
when you left the room. [laughs]

15:19.125 --> 15:21.250
No, seriously,
like, we're gonna lose this deal

15:21.333 --> 15:22.666
if you don't pull it together.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.500
They were laughing at you when you left.

15:27.041 --> 15:29.541
-[tires screech]
-[people shouting]

15:29.625 --> 15:31.000
[high-pitched squealing]

15:31.083 --> 15:32.291
[woman on phone] Hey!

15:34.958 --> 15:36.916
[man] Just start pushing, man.
Just go, go, go!

15:38.000 --> 15:40.583
-[man] Get in there. Come on.
-[man 2] Hey, hey! Calm down!

15:41.333 --> 15:42.416
[man 3] Hurry up, man!

15:45.916 --> 15:47.208
[man catcalling]

15:51.333 --> 15:52.708
[man] Don't know what to tell ya.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.250
It says I start today, second shift.

15:58.416 --> 15:59.583
Nope.

15:59.666 --> 16:02.000
I got my carpentry certificate.
I did a year of welding.

16:02.083 --> 16:05.041
I don't need birdhouses
and stop signs. Okay?

16:08.458 --> 16:10.083
Did you get a phone call or a visitor

16:10.166 --> 16:12.291
between when I had a job
and when I didn't?

16:16.708 --> 16:17.625
Okay.

16:24.666 --> 16:26.666
[machines whirring]

16:28.083 --> 16:30.250
[man] Ah, come on. Show us a little more.

16:32.166 --> 16:35.041
[Stan] After two hours, you get a break.
After five hours, you get lunch.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.500
Another two hours, you get another break.

16:37.583 --> 16:40.416
You gotta leave the line
to take a waz or something, go ahead.

16:40.500 --> 16:44.708
But make sure that you're telling a person
where you're going and how long you'll be.

16:44.791 --> 16:47.625
Here on the floor,
keep your head on a swivel, all right?

16:48.250 --> 16:50.333
Everything here is sharp.
Everything's heavy.

16:50.416 --> 16:52.250
Everything can hurt you. Be careful.

16:53.666 --> 16:56.916
These guys are gonna help you out.
Welcome to the graveyard shift.

17:00.958 --> 17:01.958
[man] Hey.

17:09.166 --> 17:11.625
-[man] You speak English?
-Yeah.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.416
That's Magda. I'm Blake.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.708
Just do what we do.

17:44.458 --> 17:45.333
[car horn honks]

17:45.416 --> 17:48.250
Hey. You need a ride someplace?

17:49.208 --> 17:50.416
You sure?

17:50.916 --> 17:52.375
You look freezing cold.

17:56.625 --> 17:57.791
See you tomorrow.

18:07.708 --> 18:09.333
[knocking at door]

18:13.666 --> 18:15.083
[knocking at door]

18:15.166 --> 18:16.958
[woman] Hey. You're past your ten.

18:17.041 --> 18:18.916
-[door unlocks]
-What the fuck?

18:20.166 --> 18:21.833
-[woman] Hurry up!
-[banging on door]

18:28.625 --> 18:29.666

18:29.750 --> 18:31.791
[woman] Drag your bitch-ass out next time.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.083
[horn honks loudly]

18:39.791 --> 18:41.791
[siren wailing]

20:26.333 --> 20:28.375
[blowing]

20:56.000 --> 20:57.083
John.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.125
There's a woman in the front yard.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.083
You know who she is?

21:11.958 --> 21:13.666
[telephone ringing]

21:30.708 --> 21:32.083
[telephone ringing]

21:32.166 --> 21:34.833
-[Ruth] Not leaving. Not leaving, Mac.
-[Mac] I hear you.

21:34.916 --> 21:37.541
I know that your daddy would not
want you gettin' in deeper trouble.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.625
[Ruth] Bullshit, Mac.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.833
[Mac] I just want you
to consider your little sister.

21:40.916 --> 21:45.541
[Ruth] I've got a gun, and I swear to God,
they come in this house, I'm gonna use it.

21:45.625 --> 21:47.250
-[Mac] Help me help you.
-[Ruth] Get…

21:47.333 --> 21:49.250
You can come stay with us.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.666
Boys can bunk in the basement.
You and Katie can have the bedroom.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.833
-[Ruth] We're not leaving. Stop.
-[Mac] Beth would love to have you.

21:53.916 --> 21:56.875
[Ruth] You know the second I step out
of here, they're gonna take her from me.

21:56.958 --> 21:58.500
We are not leaving!

21:59.375 --> 22:01.375
Get off my porch! I'm not leaving--

22:02.916 --> 22:03.958
[John] Hello.

22:05.833 --> 22:06.875
Hello.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.041
Can I help you with something?

22:10.083 --> 22:12.166
I was just looking
at everything you've done.

22:12.250 --> 22:13.875
It's really beautiful.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.416
You one of our neighbors?

22:18.708 --> 22:21.541
Uh, just…
I just did some work on the house.

22:22.416 --> 22:23.333
Way back.

22:25.458 --> 22:27.375
-We just moved in a few months ago.
-[Ruth] Yeah?

22:27.458 --> 22:31.000
-The remodel?
-No, no. Before that.

22:31.833 --> 22:33.708
Yeah, I just did finishes.

22:33.791 --> 22:36.750
Um, some built-ins
and a hutch, stuff like that.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.416
The hutch in the entry?

22:39.083 --> 22:40.375
We both love that thing.

22:40.958 --> 22:43.416
That's what sold my wife on the house.

22:43.500 --> 22:47.500
She actually-- She just repainted it
to match the new interior.

22:49.875 --> 22:51.291
I bet that looks great.

22:56.041 --> 22:58.333
Well, you can come in
and have a look if you want.

22:58.416 --> 23:00.458
Oh, no. I don't… I don't wanna interrupt.

23:00.541 --> 23:03.000
You're not interrupting.
We're not doing anything.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.833
-Are you sure?
-[chuckling] I'm sure.

23:06.625 --> 23:07.916
Come on. Uh…

23:08.458 --> 23:09.958
I'm John Ingram, by the way.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.375
-Ruth.
-Hey, Ruth. Come on.

23:18.750 --> 23:19.750
[door opens]

23:24.208 --> 23:25.166
This is it.

23:26.250 --> 23:29.250
Hun, this is Ruth.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.541
Ruth, Liz.

23:35.583 --> 23:39.125
She did work on the house.
In fact, she built the hutch.

23:40.625 --> 23:41.541
Which is a good thing.

23:41.625 --> 23:44.250
Otherwise, I would have had to buy
some fancy piece of furniture.

23:44.333 --> 23:45.416
[muffled laughter]

23:45.500 --> 23:47.333
And drop some pro bono work.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.916
[Liz] You know the Balabans?

23:55.500 --> 23:56.500
[Ruth] Uh…

23:57.416 --> 23:59.333
Uh, before them, when it was a farm.

23:59.958 --> 24:01.000
[Liz] Oh.

24:02.083 --> 24:05.208
Yeah, 'cause we found
some baby shoes in the wall.

24:09.041 --> 24:09.916
[Ruth] Hmm.

24:10.458 --> 24:12.500
Yeah, I didn't… I didn't know them.

24:16.833 --> 24:18.333
You live in the neighborhood?

24:20.458 --> 24:21.875
My sister and I did.

24:22.375 --> 24:23.708
[John] And where do you live now?

24:24.666 --> 24:28.250
Mmm, in… in Seattle.

24:32.083 --> 24:33.291
Ruth!

24:33.375 --> 24:34.708
[high-pitched squeal]

24:34.791 --> 24:38.666
-[boy] Mom. Is my laptop downstairs?
-[gasps]

24:38.750 --> 24:41.416
-Whose job is that?
-[John] Try the TV room.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.375
Uh, I didn't really realize
how late it was. I need to get going.

24:45.458 --> 24:48.166
But thank you very much
for letting me see your beautiful home.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.000
[breathing heavily]

24:58.875 --> 25:00.666
Hey, how far is your car parked?

25:00.750 --> 25:02.958
Uh, I'm gonna catch the bus.
If I run, I'll be okay.

25:03.041 --> 25:06.416
Ruth, stop, just give me a minute.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.833
It's getting dark.
I'm gonna give you a ride.

25:20.500 --> 25:23.500
And you don't remember
the people you worked for?

25:23.583 --> 25:25.416
I… I don't remember.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.250
-Really?
-It's been so long.

25:32.458 --> 25:33.708
You're a lawyer?

25:35.250 --> 25:36.958
Yeah. How did you know that?

25:37.625 --> 25:39.291
-Pro bono?
-Oh yeah.

25:41.833 --> 25:43.375
What kind of law do you do?

25:45.416 --> 25:46.500
Corporate.

25:47.583 --> 25:50.791
I do some trust work.

25:50.875 --> 25:51.833
[Ruth] Hmm.

26:01.166 --> 26:02.041
Um…

26:03.500 --> 26:06.250
I've actually been looking
for someone who does family law,

26:06.333 --> 26:08.041
and I don't know
if you know anybody that--

26:08.125 --> 26:09.375
What are you up to?

26:10.250 --> 26:14.125
Look, you've been lying
since you said hello.

26:15.458 --> 26:17.708
When people want a lawyer,
they just call one up.

26:19.708 --> 26:20.916
Something's not right.

26:23.666 --> 26:24.666
Ruth.

26:27.125 --> 26:28.166
What's up with you?

26:34.375 --> 26:36.166
I lived in that house
with my little sister

26:36.250 --> 26:37.666
when my parents died.

26:42.500 --> 26:43.583
Went into the system.

26:43.666 --> 26:46.416
She got adopted, and that's just
the last place I was with her.

26:50.458 --> 26:53.583
I wrote her for years
and, you know, I didn't…

26:54.375 --> 26:57.500
I didn't hear anything back. I don't know.
I don't even know if she's alive.

27:02.666 --> 27:04.916
But I didn't wanna
unload that on your family. [chuckles]

27:05.500 --> 27:06.916
Look, well, the system…

27:08.583 --> 27:10.166
the system can be hardcore.

27:12.916 --> 27:14.208
I've seen it before.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.458
[Ruth] Hmm.

27:19.708 --> 27:22.208
But you guys made
a really nice home of it.

27:22.291 --> 27:23.791
-Thank you.
-Beautiful.

27:27.083 --> 27:29.125
Thanks for the ride. [clears throat]

27:37.458 --> 27:40.750
Ruth. Ruth. Look.

27:42.166 --> 27:46.666
It's tricky what you're tryin' to do.
I'm gonna see if I can help you out.

27:53.833 --> 27:54.875
Here you go.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.375
Give my office a call.

27:58.416 --> 28:01.666
Okay, thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

28:23.833 --> 28:26.000
[mom] Call if you think of anything else.

28:26.083 --> 28:28.250
Oh, I might pop into Trader Joe's.
Do you want anything?

28:28.333 --> 28:32.041
-Mom, the fridge is beyond packed.
-I only have to go in for an hour.

28:32.125 --> 28:35.541
-Text, if you need anything.
-[Katherine] I'm good, but thank you.

28:37.916 --> 28:39.458
-[door closes]
-[sighs]

28:40.250 --> 28:41.958
I'm like a bomb being disarmed.

28:42.041 --> 28:44.333
[girl] They'll relax.
Just give them some time.

28:44.416 --> 28:45.250
Thank you.

28:46.416 --> 28:49.000
[girl] You know, they heard you up
all night again last night.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.750
Gotta go back on your meds.

28:52.500 --> 28:53.916
I can't play on that stuff.

28:55.833 --> 28:58.375
-But thank you for not telling them.
-Of course.

28:59.916 --> 29:01.416
None of us can hear a difference.

29:01.500 --> 29:03.541
Yep, and you're all tone-deaf.

29:05.291 --> 29:06.875
But you need sleep.

29:07.416 --> 29:09.125
Are you having those nightmares again?

29:12.708 --> 29:13.625
[muffled screaming]

29:13.708 --> 29:14.750
[Katherine] Sometimes.

29:17.583 --> 29:20.041
[sighs] They're just random flashes, so…

29:22.375 --> 29:23.958
Same as usual.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.125
What else do you remember?

29:35.916 --> 29:36.833
[blowing]

29:38.541 --> 29:40.000
[Katherine] There was music.

29:45.166 --> 29:49.250
And a woman close to me,
but I can't make out who it is.

29:54.083 --> 29:55.958
I don't know what she was to me.

30:00.666 --> 30:02.500
[girl] Maybe it's somebody in foster care.

30:04.458 --> 30:05.375
Yeah.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.291
You know,
we could actually look into that.

30:07.375 --> 30:09.500
-See if there's anybody--
-I'm not doing that.

30:10.125 --> 30:11.166
Why not?

30:12.166 --> 30:13.333
'Cause you guys are my family.

30:13.416 --> 30:17.000
Yeah, but, like, aren't you curious?
Don't you wanna know about your past?

30:17.083 --> 30:19.958
No, Em, I don't need proof that
I'm more fucked up than you are.

30:20.041 --> 30:21.500
Well, don't get pissed.

30:25.583 --> 30:26.791
[sighs]

30:27.958 --> 30:29.708
Sorry. [chuckles softly]

30:53.000 --> 30:54.416
[electric tool whirring]

31:00.333 --> 31:01.708
[electric tool whirring]

31:06.208 --> 31:08.708
-[Ruth] Hello.
-[man] Come on up.

31:08.791 --> 31:09.833
[door closes]

31:18.791 --> 31:21.708
Hey. Can I help you?

31:21.791 --> 31:24.500
Yeah, I was, uh,
walking by, and I heard you.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.541
Just came in to see if you guys
are looking for extra hands or anything.

31:28.625 --> 31:31.041
Sorry, we're a NGO,

31:31.125 --> 31:33.375
so we're not really
looking for help right now.

31:34.541 --> 31:35.541
Okay.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.750
-[Ruth] What's it gonna be?
-Kitchen for the homeless.

31:41.625 --> 31:44.708
Community center. It's donation-based.

31:44.791 --> 31:48.291
That's why I had
to let go of most of my guys.

31:48.375 --> 31:50.416
It's probably a good thing you let 'em go.

31:51.250 --> 31:53.125
They should've snapped
a line a couple times

31:53.208 --> 31:55.458
before they got
so enthusiastic about framing.

31:56.500 --> 31:58.375
You wanna make sure
that that's true and plumb

31:58.458 --> 31:59.958
or that door's not going to hang right.

32:03.208 --> 32:04.250
You have references?

32:06.875 --> 32:07.916
Give me an hour.

32:09.541 --> 32:12.250
They're gonna pay me minimum wage.
Well, it's almost minimum wage,

32:12.333 --> 32:15.416
but it's a great deal for both of us,
and I get to sharpen my skills.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.166
-Sharpen your skills?
-Yeah.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.750
I'm thinking you look like hell.

32:18.833 --> 32:20.583
You told me to get a job. I got two.

32:21.083 --> 32:22.458
-You been usin'?
-What?

32:22.541 --> 32:25.125
You seem a little edgy to me. You okay?

32:33.208 --> 32:35.000
So this guy knows
you're an offender, right?

32:35.083 --> 32:36.083
He didn't ask.

32:36.166 --> 32:37.875
Why is he willing to trust you?

32:37.958 --> 32:41.708
That stud wall you're leaning against,
I built it in 45 minutes.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.333
You better tell your boss who you are.

32:46.416 --> 32:49.125
Why? I gotta be a convict wherever I go?

32:49.208 --> 32:52.500
No, you're a cop killer
everywhere you go, yes.

32:53.958 --> 32:55.916
Sooner you accept it, the better.

33:19.041 --> 33:20.666
[Blake] What do you mean I eat fast?

33:21.916 --> 33:23.416
That's why you're the champ.

33:23.500 --> 33:27.666
Okay. You finish yours before me. [laughs]

33:27.750 --> 33:29.375
[Stan] You can't leave the line

33:29.458 --> 33:31.916
unless you tell the person beside you
where you're goin'.

33:32.000 --> 33:35.125
You gotta waz, take a waz.
Just let somebody know what's happenin'.

33:35.625 --> 33:38.208
Here on the floor,
keep your head on a swivel, okay?

33:38.291 --> 33:41.375
Everything here is sharp.
Everything can hurt you. Be careful.

33:41.875 --> 33:43.333
Welcome to the graveyard shift.

34:10.250 --> 34:13.083
You always wanted
to be in the fish game or…

34:13.166 --> 34:14.375
[Ruth chuckles softly]

34:16.708 --> 34:17.625
[laughs]

34:23.375 --> 34:25.791
-[rock music blasting over speakers]
-Oh. Sorry.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.083
[volume decreases]

34:27.166 --> 34:30.875
I didn't know that was gonna be so loud.
Sorry, that's, uh…

34:33.250 --> 34:36.375
I know it sounds weird,
but that's actually my band.

34:36.458 --> 34:38.916
That's me on the drums.

34:39.583 --> 34:42.666
So I don't know.
We've got our own thing going.

34:42.750 --> 34:43.875
You like it or…

34:45.375 --> 34:46.708
Uh…

34:46.791 --> 34:49.708
-Yeah.
-[laughing] You hate it.

34:49.791 --> 34:52.708
I don't hate the drums.

34:53.875 --> 34:54.708
Yeah.

35:05.666 --> 35:07.875
-You live here?
-It's my second job.

35:07.958 --> 35:09.208
Second job?

35:10.041 --> 35:12.416
-Have a good night. Well, day.
-[car door closes]

35:15.250 --> 35:16.541
[Blake] See you in the line.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.916
[piano music playing]

35:55.708 --> 35:57.958
[scream echoing]

36:05.416 --> 36:09.000
[Ruth over speaker] Hi, John.
It's Ruth, calling again.

36:09.875 --> 36:11.458
Sorry to keep calling.

36:11.541 --> 36:14.208
I just wanna know
if you've heard anything.

36:14.708 --> 36:16.041
Um…

36:16.916 --> 36:18.291
Please call me, thanks.

36:19.000 --> 36:20.541
[nail gun firing]

36:32.458 --> 36:33.458
[Ruth sighs]

36:45.583 --> 36:47.791
[siren wailing in distance]

36:53.625 --> 36:54.833
[sighs]

37:05.375 --> 37:06.583
[car keys rattle]

37:15.750 --> 37:17.541
[siren wailing in distance]

37:33.375 --> 37:34.416
[siren stops]

37:52.083 --> 37:53.833
-[Blake] Ruth!
-[clattering]

38:39.375 --> 38:40.541
-[Ruth] Fuck!
-[Blake] Oh shit!

38:40.625 --> 38:41.833
-Fuck!
-[Blake] Shit, I'm sorry.

38:41.916 --> 38:44.250
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-What the fuck!

38:44.333 --> 38:47.208
-Jesus fucking Christ!
-[Blake] I'm sorry. God!

38:47.708 --> 38:48.666
What are you doing?

38:48.750 --> 38:51.083
I called your name.
I… I didn't hear anything. So I just--

38:51.166 --> 38:54.875
-You can't do shit like that!
-I was… Donuts. I was gonna--

38:55.708 --> 38:57.708
-You cannot trespass like that.
-Shit. I'm sorry.

38:57.791 --> 38:59.875
What do you want? Why are you here?

38:59.958 --> 39:03.958
I couldn't sleep,
and I thought about you here working,

39:04.041 --> 39:07.791
and I thought
maybe you would want some donuts, so…

39:10.708 --> 39:11.916
I'm sorry.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.166
[Ruth] You can't come
into people's places like that.

39:14.250 --> 39:16.166
-You can't do that.
-I know.

39:16.250 --> 39:17.250
[panting]

39:19.250 --> 39:22.125
Shit. I also… I brought you this…

39:22.791 --> 39:24.833
this coat here. Just…

39:25.500 --> 39:27.666
You know, it's really good,

39:27.750 --> 39:30.541
and I got another that's smaller at home
if this one's too big,

39:30.625 --> 39:32.166
but this one's way better.

39:32.250 --> 39:34.250
I mean, your coat sucks, so I just…

39:35.666 --> 39:38.750
I don't know.
Maybe you wanna just try it on.

39:40.375 --> 39:42.750
You brought me a jacket? Why?

39:43.333 --> 39:45.666
Uh, well, just so you'd be warm.

39:51.625 --> 39:53.000
Do you wanna try?

40:07.458 --> 40:09.500
-I got it. I got it.
-[Blake] Sure.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.666
I'll just clean up this mess here.

40:21.875 --> 40:26.291
Hey, that… looks pretty good. That's…

40:27.208 --> 40:28.833
That fits. Here, this…

40:28.916 --> 40:32.083
[hesitating] Sorry,
it's just that there's a hood here.

40:32.166 --> 40:33.791
That's like really…

40:36.666 --> 40:37.583
[chuckles softly]

40:40.000 --> 40:41.750
Sorry, you don't have to…

40:45.083 --> 40:47.083
-I'm sorry I scared you.
-No.

40:48.541 --> 40:50.375
I'm sorry about the donuts.

40:54.833 --> 40:56.958
Good luck with, uh, you know…

41:02.041 --> 41:03.041
Sorry.

41:13.083 --> 41:16.083
[Ruth on voice mail]
John, uh, it's Ruth again.

41:19.083 --> 41:21.041
I didn't give you the whole story.

41:22.208 --> 41:28.291
And I'm sure by now you've
worked out all the parts I left out. Uh…

41:31.291 --> 41:33.291
Please give me a chance to explain.

41:34.458 --> 41:38.416
You know, for 20 years,
I wrote thousands of letters.

41:38.500 --> 41:42.583
I did everything I could to reach her
the way that the system wanted me to,

41:42.666 --> 41:44.833
but I… I didn't hear anything.

41:46.708 --> 41:49.291
I don't wanna disrupt her life,

41:50.250 --> 41:53.333
and I'm not looking
for a second chance. I just…

41:54.666 --> 41:57.541
You know, man,
I just… I just wanna know that she's okay.

41:59.458 --> 42:02.875
If I had told you the full truth,
you wouldn't have offered to help me,

42:02.958 --> 42:07.208
and I know that's not an excuse,
but I really need your help.

42:08.791 --> 42:12.291
If I could just…
maybe just talk to the parents.

42:14.625 --> 42:15.625
[Ruth sighs]

42:15.708 --> 42:17.791
Please, John, she's my sister.

42:19.375 --> 42:21.583
Thanks. Bye.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.250
Yeah, okay.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.708
-[Liz] Morning, Tyler.
-Morning.

42:31.458 --> 42:33.833
[Tyler sighs]
Working mostly upstairs today?

42:33.916 --> 42:34.750
Yeah.

42:36.416 --> 42:39.125
Did you know the family
that lived here before the Balabans?

42:39.208 --> 42:42.333
Westovers. Nice folks.
Put in the mantelpiece.

42:42.416 --> 42:44.666
They have a daughter named Ruth?

42:46.333 --> 42:49.083
No. That'd be the Slaters.

42:50.083 --> 42:52.625
It was way back.
Didn't they tell you about that?

42:53.916 --> 42:54.875
Mmm-mmm.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.541
Oh jeez.

42:59.708 --> 43:01.958
Ruth's dad killed himself.

43:02.958 --> 43:05.625
She was living in the house alone
with her little sister.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.041
Sheriff came to evict.

43:11.416 --> 43:12.541
She killed him.

43:20.541 --> 43:23.125
-[indistinct chatter]
-[upbeat music playing over speakers]

43:29.708 --> 43:32.291
How does that look? Does it look goofy?

43:47.375 --> 43:50.916
-Officer, you gonna arrest me?
-[scoffing] Yeah, for being a prick.

43:52.791 --> 43:55.541
Did your brother pass along
that information I gave him?

43:56.125 --> 43:57.541
[Steve] What information?

43:57.625 --> 43:59.625
I got two work addresses.

43:59.708 --> 44:03.666
One's near a fucking armpit,
South King Street, Sixth Ave South,

44:03.750 --> 44:05.583
near Hing Hay Park, Chinatown.

44:05.666 --> 44:08.458
She's there every day. All by herself.

44:15.500 --> 44:17.666
[Keith] You coming back in?
They're making speeches.

44:17.750 --> 44:19.416
He was Dad's friend.
You could act like you care.

44:19.500 --> 44:20.750
What the fuck are you doing?

44:23.416 --> 44:26.958
What you should be doing.
Everybody's trying to have a good time--

44:27.041 --> 44:29.041
Pressing the cops about Ruth Slater.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.458
-Are you fucking crazy?
-They're not gonna care what we do.

44:31.541 --> 44:32.625
There's no "we."

44:33.625 --> 44:36.875
You're not gonna do anything anyway.
You just talk like always.

44:36.958 --> 44:38.791
You're the one who doesn't do anything.

44:39.666 --> 44:43.250
You don't remember what it was like
when we lost the house. That's her fault.

44:43.333 --> 44:45.333
We lost it 'cause
Mom couldn't stop drinking.

44:45.416 --> 44:47.208
And why do you think that is?

44:48.000 --> 44:49.958
You don't remember him. I do.

44:50.708 --> 44:54.166
But sure, carry on with your nice life,
like it just didn't happen.

44:58.458 --> 44:59.958
I'm not saying that it didn't happen.

45:03.250 --> 45:05.166
She walks around free.

45:06.791 --> 45:08.875
She's got a job and a guy.

45:10.583 --> 45:12.250
She lives like it never happened.

45:14.541 --> 45:16.666
Now, you tell me if that's fair.

45:16.750 --> 45:19.541
Hey. What you guys doin'?

45:21.291 --> 45:23.541
We have a sitter for once.
Can't we just have fun?

45:24.166 --> 45:25.750
Thought big brother had that handled.

45:28.625 --> 45:29.916
You're an asshole.

45:35.083 --> 45:36.541
Just think about it.

45:56.791 --> 45:59.958
[John] And you got air.
You had perfect control of that thing.

46:00.041 --> 46:04.083
[Ryan] Bro, I totally dusted you on
the quad. You just can't say it. [laughs]

46:04.166 --> 46:06.916
No, no, he's right. He did perfect.

46:07.000 --> 46:08.625
-[John laughing]
-[door closes]

46:10.583 --> 46:11.541
Hey, babe.

46:11.625 --> 46:13.500
How could you not have told me?

46:13.583 --> 46:17.083
-[footsteps approaching]
-Mom, I did the quad at, like, full speed.

46:22.708 --> 46:23.666
Look.

46:24.416 --> 46:27.375
Once I found out,
I wasn't just gonna take her case.

46:27.458 --> 46:30.541
-She was in my house with our children.
-Yeah.

46:31.291 --> 46:35.000
And you're right, I should've told you
when I found out, and I'm sorry.

46:35.083 --> 46:37.833
When a murderer talks her way
into my kitchen to relive the moment,

46:37.916 --> 46:39.666
yeah, you should've told me. Shit, John.

46:40.958 --> 46:41.833
Wait a minute.

46:42.666 --> 46:44.750
What do you mean,
"you wasn't gonna take the case?"

46:45.500 --> 46:47.166
She came by the office today.

46:47.250 --> 46:48.500
No, no, no.

46:48.583 --> 46:52.041
Liz, she wasn't reliving something.
That was trauma.

46:52.125 --> 46:54.291
She wasn't shot at
in some Kuwaiti firefight.

46:54.375 --> 46:56.416
She killed somebody in cold blood.

46:57.250 --> 47:01.250
[John] The woman has been in the system.
You know, that can be more harm than--

47:01.333 --> 47:02.791
If that were any of your Black sons

47:02.875 --> 47:04.583
who had been
in the system in this situation,

47:04.666 --> 47:05.666
they would be dead.

47:08.125 --> 47:13.000
I'm just saying that she did her time,
and she has every right--

47:13.083 --> 47:15.375
I'm not talking about her rights.
I'm talking about her lying.

47:15.458 --> 47:20.416
If she tells the truth, she's denied
her rights, you know that as well as me--

47:20.500 --> 47:22.583
-That is not the reality for that woman.
-That's a reality.

47:22.666 --> 47:24.000
She would not be denied her rights

47:24.083 --> 47:27.708
because she could easily find
a bleeding heart attorney in you.

47:29.583 --> 47:31.458
I can't tell you
what to do professionally,

47:31.541 --> 47:33.416
but you keep her shit away from here.

47:41.958 --> 47:43.958
[pensive music playing]

48:34.750 --> 48:37.125
[tires squeal]

48:40.791 --> 48:42.333
[man] Stay clear.

48:44.625 --> 48:45.625
Whoa! Right there.

48:46.625 --> 48:48.625
[uneasy music playing]

48:53.500 --> 48:55.333
[Ruth] Why are you guys always late?

48:55.416 --> 48:57.250
[man 2] We showed up. I don't know, lady.

49:20.791 --> 49:22.500
[Ruth] How about a heads-up next time?

49:22.583 --> 49:25.416
[man 2] Our apologies, ma'am.
Will you sign this form?

49:30.583 --> 49:32.791
Since you're making me late,
you can give me a hand.

49:43.750 --> 49:44.625
Thank you.

50:00.583 --> 50:02.416
[Steve] So what's this place gonna be?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.875
A community center for the homeless.

50:22.208 --> 50:24.250
[whispering] What else? What else? Okay.

50:30.125 --> 50:32.000
[Steve] It's some
really nice work in here.

50:33.958 --> 50:35.625
Well, your parents must be proud.

50:36.333 --> 50:37.291
[Ruth] Uh…

50:37.375 --> 50:39.583
I don't know. They're dead.

50:39.666 --> 50:42.916
Um, listen, I gotta run.
Thanks for the help.

50:43.958 --> 50:47.541
That's rough. Your parents dying.

50:47.625 --> 50:50.083
Yeah, but life goes on, right?

50:50.166 --> 50:51.708
[bus departing]

51:01.208 --> 51:04.583
Look, I really appreciate the help,
but I need to get going.

51:07.791 --> 51:08.791
[chuckles]

51:08.875 --> 51:10.833
Yeah. Sorry, I don't wanna hold you up.

51:13.750 --> 51:14.750
Nice to meet you.

51:23.333 --> 51:24.750
[alarm beeping]

51:26.250 --> 51:27.625
[door closes]

51:35.916 --> 51:37.000
Shit.

51:51.083 --> 51:52.500
[footsteps receding]

51:56.125 --> 51:58.125
[tense music playing]

52:57.125 --> 52:59.541
[tense music swells to crescendo]

52:59.625 --> 53:00.833
[panting]

53:00.916 --> 53:02.750
[car horn honking]

53:06.250 --> 53:08.625
-One minute to spare.
-[Ruth] Did I make it or not?

53:08.708 --> 53:11.041
[Vince] All this running's
gonna kill you, Ruth. Come here.

53:15.916 --> 53:18.125
I'm getting information
you got yourself a lawyer.

53:18.208 --> 53:21.041
-What you think that's gonna do, huh?
-It's none of your business.

53:21.125 --> 53:23.166
-It's none of my business?
-No.

53:23.916 --> 53:26.041
-You trying to contact your sister?
-It's my right.

53:26.125 --> 53:28.916
-No, you lost those rights 20 years ago.
-It's my fucking family.

53:29.541 --> 53:32.208
Blood doesn't make you family.
Get that shit out your head.

53:32.875 --> 53:34.958
There's a reason why
your sister hasn't contacted you.

53:35.041 --> 53:36.375
You're a convict.

53:37.166 --> 53:39.125
All she knows of you is as a killer.

53:40.083 --> 53:41.625
She's probably scared of you.

53:42.541 --> 53:46.125
Let that girl live her life.
Your life starts here, now.

53:46.208 --> 53:47.916
Not 20 years ago.

53:50.458 --> 53:52.458
She's actually better off without you.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.458
[wistful music playing]

54:40.958 --> 54:42.333
[laughing]

54:42.416 --> 54:44.416
Yes. I'll drink it anyway.

54:47.916 --> 54:49.916
[wistful music continues]

54:57.958 --> 54:58.875
Thanks.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.500
[piano music playing]

55:34.166 --> 55:35.958
[piano music continues]

56:09.833 --> 56:11.458
[cell phone buzzing]

56:13.333 --> 56:15.166
Hey, I'm just walking into conferences.

56:15.250 --> 56:17.375
[dad] Rachel? [chuckles]

56:17.458 --> 56:20.833
We just got a letter from a lawyer
representing Ruth Slater.

56:26.458 --> 56:27.708
[plays off-key]

56:32.333 --> 56:33.250
[sighs]

56:43.541 --> 56:46.416
What's up?
Couldn't talk to me on the phone?

56:46.500 --> 56:47.500
I talked to her.

56:49.916 --> 56:51.125
You talked to who?

56:51.791 --> 56:54.458
-Ruth Slater.
-[chuckling] Jesus, Steve.

56:55.041 --> 56:55.916
You talked to her?

56:56.000 --> 56:57.708
You wanna know what she said?

57:00.208 --> 57:01.500
She said, "Life goes on."

57:05.583 --> 57:06.750
You were right.

57:10.916 --> 57:12.166
It's not fair.

57:14.750 --> 57:17.208
-You serious right now?
-Not your bullshit plan.

57:19.041 --> 57:21.041
She's still got a sister out there.

57:23.583 --> 57:25.958
Let's do to her what she did to us.

57:34.333 --> 57:38.416
[Blake] When you think about,
like, a bonsai tree, like, it just…

57:38.500 --> 57:42.083
All it is, is a tree that's just
had a lot more love, right?

57:42.166 --> 57:45.458
Like, a lot more focus.
It's how-- Uh-oh. There they are.

57:45.541 --> 57:47.375
Paul, how are you? Good day at the office?

57:47.458 --> 57:50.208
-[Paul] How's it going?
-What's up, Petey? This is my friend Ruth.

57:50.291 --> 57:53.625
No, it's just, like, a lot more focus.
It's not wild, you know.

57:53.708 --> 57:57.166
That is a bonsai. I think that's why
it's, like, The Way of the Warrior.

57:57.250 --> 57:58.666
Oh wow. Look, that's the…

57:59.416 --> 58:02.500
That's Patty's nephew.
You know, Patty from work?

58:02.583 --> 58:05.083
Man, Patty, she… she always
looks like she's scowling.

58:05.166 --> 58:06.916
I call her Mean Mug Patty? No?

58:07.000 --> 58:10.791
She always got that look on her face,
like somebody stole her apple? [laughs]

58:10.875 --> 58:14.375
Anyway, those are her nephews.
They're… they're really cool.

58:14.458 --> 58:16.625
They're, like, a Seattle institution.

58:16.708 --> 58:23.000
Their grandpa was
the first Asian-American Seattle cop.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.041
Yeah, he's kind of like a hero cop.

58:25.125 --> 58:28.916
He's just sort of beloved, you know.
Yeah, they're… they're cool kids.

58:29.000 --> 58:30.583
Yeah, you know.

58:36.833 --> 58:38.041
-Yes.
-[man] Here you go.

58:38.125 --> 58:39.250
[Blake] I love it.

58:39.333 --> 58:42.500
Ruth, you have no idea
what you're in store for, Ruth, uh…

58:43.208 --> 58:46.500
-Ruth is an enormous fan of the band.
-[man] Okay.

58:46.583 --> 58:48.666
[chuckling] She's praying
for us to get back together.

58:48.750 --> 58:50.041
You need to pull the trigger.

58:50.125 --> 58:53.625
-Sure, why not? Enjoy, guys.
-[Blake] Thanks, Nicky.

59:00.000 --> 59:01.375
How come you're not eating?

59:04.541 --> 59:05.708
You all right?

59:10.125 --> 59:14.291
Ruth, if there's something on your mind,
you can say it, like…

59:17.208 --> 59:18.041
Uh…

59:21.083 --> 59:22.291
[Blake] Ruth?

59:27.125 --> 59:28.333
I was in prison.

59:29.458 --> 59:30.625
I just got out.

59:33.375 --> 59:34.291
[laughs]

59:34.375 --> 59:36.916
Shut up. Why would you say that?

59:40.208 --> 59:41.791
I was in for 20 years.

59:46.833 --> 59:47.916
For what?

59:51.041 --> 59:51.958
Um…

59:53.208 --> 59:55.250
Sheriff. Snohomish sheriff.

59:56.541 --> 59:57.541
Murder.

1:00:00.250 --> 1:00:01.416
An accident?

1:00:25.958 --> 1:00:27.208
-I'm sorry.
-Yeah.

1:00:31.500 --> 1:00:32.500
[softly] I get it.

1:00:33.791 --> 1:00:35.125
I just can't, uh…

1:00:40.583 --> 1:00:43.250
-Look, I'm sorry, but I--
-No. I get it.

1:00:58.333 --> 1:00:59.958
[girl giggles] Right!

We can't just ignore it.
She hired a lawyer.

1:02:00.208 --> 1:02:01.541
[dad] The law's clear.

1:02:01.625 --> 1:02:04.291
If she comes near Katherine,
she's going back to prison.

1:02:04.958 --> 1:02:06.791
[Rachel] She asked to meet with us.

1:02:06.875 --> 1:02:09.416
-Not Katherine.
-And she won't stop there.

1:02:09.500 --> 1:02:13.666
What possible benefit can there be
bringing this person into her life?

1:02:13.750 --> 1:02:15.333
Particularly now?

We always knew that we'd have
to deal with this someday.

-Just not yet.
-She's an adult.

1:02:41.166 --> 1:02:42.375
We waited too long for this.

1:02:47.125 --> 1:02:50.083
We could just go
and listen to what she has to say.

1:02:51.500 --> 1:02:54.875
Maybe there's something she can tell us
to help Katherine.

1:02:54.958 --> 1:02:58.750
Or she can do 23andMe.
She doesn't have to talk to a murderer.

1:02:59.458 --> 1:03:03.375
Go look at her. Does she look like
she's ready to confront that?

1:03:04.166 --> 1:03:06.125
-No.
-Thank you.

1:03:06.208 --> 1:03:07.291

[Patty] You heard me. Watch your back.

I'm gonna get ya.

1:04:09.916 --> 1:04:11.166

I'm gonna help you out,

so you don't have
to give me a little speech.

1:05:51.583 --> 1:05:54.541

1:06:13.833 --> 1:06:14.833
What?

1:06:15.958 --> 1:06:18.166
Thought you might like
a change of perspective.

1:06:21.291 --> 1:06:22.583
Are you shitting me?

1:06:27.333 --> 1:06:32.083
If I was going to give you a speech,
I'd tell you that everybody ends up here.

1:06:33.500 --> 1:06:36.291
Where you gotta decide
how you're going to be,

1:06:37.416 --> 1:06:39.416
'cause this world
is nothing like you thought.

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:43.666
And everything you learned in the yard
keeps you on a path to right back inside.

1:06:43.750 --> 1:06:47.291
People are exactly the same out here
as they are in the yard. Exactly.

1:06:47.375 --> 1:06:49.416
Question is, do you wanna be the same?

1:06:57.583 --> 1:06:59.916
Looks like a right haymaker.
You couldn't see that coming?

1:07:02.625 --> 1:07:04.250
And what's up with your phone?

1:07:06.833 --> 1:07:08.041
Went in a puddle.

1:07:12.416 --> 1:07:14.250
Well, your fancy lawyer called.

1:07:16.083 --> 1:07:19.166
You got a meeting. Just the parents.

1:07:19.250 --> 1:07:20.125
When?

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:22.000
I don't know. Call your lawyer.

1:07:22.666 --> 1:07:25.833
And clean yourself up a little.
Act like I'm teaching you stuff.

1:07:35.083 --> 1:07:37.416
[Rachel] Okay, honey,
remember, no crack today.

1:07:37.500 --> 1:07:38.708

-[Emily] Bye.

1:08:31.333 --> 1:08:32.583
[Rachel] Have fun. You got this.

1:08:32.666 --> 1:08:34.083
[Katherine] You don't need
to walk me inside.

1:08:34.166 --> 1:08:35.000
[dad] Okay.

1:08:35.083 --> 1:08:36.375

1:09:40.500 --> 1:09:42.916
[John] They don't have to be here.
Remember that.

1:09:43.666 --> 1:09:46.041
But they're looking
for any reason to say no.

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:50.041
Hello.

1:09:52.250 --> 1:09:54.250
Ruth, this Michael and Rachel.

1:09:55.125 --> 1:09:59.083
Now, they've asked me to conceal
their last names for this proceeding.

1:10:02.416 --> 1:10:03.500
Let's have a seat.

1:10:06.583 --> 1:10:07.791
[Michael clears throat]

1:10:11.833 --> 1:10:12.833
[John] All right.

1:10:18.333 --> 1:10:21.333
So, first thing, I'd like to
thank the two of you for coming.

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.250
I think it's best that
we all just stay open.

1:10:24.333 --> 1:10:26.625
There's a lot of complicated feelings,

1:10:26.708 --> 1:10:29.583
and I'm here
to help wade through that with you.

1:10:32.416 --> 1:10:34.583
-Okay.
-Okay. Um…

1:10:34.666 --> 1:10:40.375
Well, first of all, the no-contact order
was the judge's decision.

1:10:41.708 --> 1:10:42.791
Not ours.

1:10:44.958 --> 1:10:46.291
Katherine… [hesitates]

1:10:47.083 --> 1:10:50.750
Katherine has no conscious memory
of her life before us.

1:10:51.625 --> 1:10:53.125
She was traumatized.

1:10:54.041 --> 1:10:55.708
Now she's doing well.

1:10:58.958 --> 1:11:01.625
Of course she struggles sometimes,
like everyone, but…

1:11:03.458 --> 1:11:05.375
She has opportunities
she never would've had.

1:11:05.458 --> 1:11:06.875
[Rachel] She's very talented.

1:11:06.958 --> 1:11:08.541
[Michael] She has a good life.

1:11:08.625 --> 1:11:11.083
A loving family, stability.

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:12.958
[high-pitched squeal]

1:11:13.041 --> 1:11:15.875
Who would it possibly benefit
to disrupt that?

1:11:17.958 --> 1:11:19.541
We don't know anything about Miss Slater

1:11:19.625 --> 1:11:21.291
except that she's been
in prison for murder,

1:11:21.375 --> 1:11:26.000
and I understand
she's trying to rebuild her life, but…

1:11:27.125 --> 1:11:29.791
What would Katherine gain
by meeting her now?

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.375
-Can I speak?
-Yes.

1:11:39.375 --> 1:11:40.416
Katie…

1:11:41.750 --> 1:11:42.750
Katherine…

1:11:44.708 --> 1:11:48.791
My mom died having her,
so I raised her from a baby.

1:11:51.250 --> 1:11:53.208
Dad didn't do anything before he…

1:11:56.250 --> 1:11:58.125
before he gave up. He quit.

1:11:59.041 --> 1:12:02.291
I didn't. I don't quit. Not on Katie.

1:12:05.916 --> 1:12:07.583
But life doesn't start at five.

1:12:09.666 --> 1:12:11.041
Those are big years.

1:12:14.583 --> 1:12:15.791
Do you have kids of your own?

1:12:20.958 --> 1:12:24.958
Whatever her life was like before,
and I'm sure there were good moments,

1:12:26.166 --> 1:12:28.166
they were obliterated by what you did.

1:12:28.250 --> 1:12:30.208
Does she really not remember me?

1:12:30.291 --> 1:12:31.916
-She doesn't.
-[Ruth] I don't believe that.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:33.833
I don't believe
that she doesn't remember me.

1:12:33.916 --> 1:12:35.791
Does she know about the no-contact order?

1:12:35.875 --> 1:12:38.041
-Ruth, calm yourself down.
-Does she?

1:12:38.125 --> 1:12:41.000
[Michael hesitates]
You know what's striking to me?

1:12:41.750 --> 1:12:43.875
Is that we're here
because of what you want.

1:12:43.958 --> 1:12:45.666
Not what's best for our daughter.

1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:48.583
[John] I think maybe you should

1:12:49.916 --> 1:12:51.250
move on to something else.

1:12:52.916 --> 1:12:54.541
Do you have any other questions?

1:12:56.041 --> 1:12:57.000
Is she sleeping?

1:13:00.291 --> 1:13:01.750
She never slept as a kid.

1:13:02.583 --> 1:13:05.791
She sleeps fine. You know, I…

1:13:06.375 --> 1:13:08.708
I don't think
there's anything more to talk about.

1:13:08.791 --> 1:13:10.541
-Don't… Just…
-[Michael] Rachel? Let's go.

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:12.583
I wrote and sent letters
to Social Services.

1:13:12.666 --> 1:13:16.000
Did you get any of my letters?
Did Katie read any of my letters?

1:13:16.083 --> 1:13:18.541
Everything we did,
we did in her best interest.

1:13:18.625 --> 1:13:21.333
-What did you fucking do to my letters?
-Ruth, calm down.

1:13:22.708 --> 1:13:24.375
What did you do to my letters?

1:13:25.541 --> 1:13:28.166
Did you throw them away?
Did you burn them?

1:13:28.875 --> 1:13:30.625
Look at me when I'm talking to you, bitch!

1:13:30.708 --> 1:13:33.208
-Okay, that's it. Come on, Rachel.
-[John] Ruth!

1:13:33.291 --> 1:13:35.458
You burned my fucking letters
like I don't exist?

1:13:35.541 --> 1:13:37.666
-You asked us to come. We came.
-[Ruth] What the fuck?

1:13:37.750 --> 1:13:39.791
-If you had any respect--
-Respect?

1:13:39.875 --> 1:13:43.000
Talk about respect.
I spent 20 years in a fucking cell

1:13:43.083 --> 1:13:46.291
the size of your walk-in closet,
waiting for one shred of information!

1:13:46.375 --> 1:13:47.791
[Michael] You were
in that cell for a reason!

1:13:47.875 --> 1:13:50.291
What gives you the reason
to treat me like I don't exist?

1:13:50.375 --> 1:13:52.000
-[Michael] You keep her away from us!
-I exist!

1:13:52.083 --> 1:13:54.916
Or I'll press charges.
You'll go back today!

1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.291
-I exist!
-Listen to him, he's right!

1:13:57.375 --> 1:13:58.291
[panting]

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:01.375
I didn't burn your letters.

1:14:01.458 --> 1:14:03.166
Then tell her about me!

1:14:06.250 --> 1:14:07.291
Rachel?

1:14:13.750 --> 1:14:17.208
[John] I think that's as far
as I can take it, Ruth.

1:14:22.375 --> 1:14:24.375
[melancholy music playing]

1:15:30.291 --> 1:15:31.250
Fuck!

1:15:32.083 --> 1:15:33.166
[yells]

1:15:33.833 --> 1:15:34.791
Fuck!

1:15:37.708 --> 1:15:39.125
[yells]

1:15:52.958 --> 1:15:54.958
[birds squawking]

1:16:07.625 --> 1:16:10.625
[Blake] Hey, Ruth.
Could you just wait one second?

1:16:10.708 --> 1:16:13.958
I have one thing to tell you,
and then I'm gonna leave you alone, okay?

1:16:14.041 --> 1:16:15.750
-I'm good. I'm good!
-[Blake] You're not good.

1:16:15.833 --> 1:16:17.333
-I'm good! Okay?
-Okay.

1:16:17.416 --> 1:16:19.166
-Look, I'm a convict.
-I'm good.

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:21.083
I'm a convict.

1:16:23.125 --> 1:16:25.250
I got out of Clallam
a year and a half ago.

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:30.083
I'm sorry, Ruth. You just… It hit me.

1:16:31.208 --> 1:16:33.041
You said what you said, and I just froze,

1:16:33.125 --> 1:16:36.583
and I fucking sat there like an asshole,
and I hate myself for it. But…

1:16:36.666 --> 1:16:37.875
[hesitates]

1:16:40.000 --> 1:16:41.375
You're on active, right?

1:16:43.041 --> 1:16:45.416
Yeah, no known felons.

1:16:47.958 --> 1:16:49.166
[laughs]

1:16:49.250 --> 1:16:52.750
I mean, shit, we're in violation
just standing here, right?

1:16:54.875 --> 1:16:56.833
Ruth, I had to talk to somebody.

1:16:58.125 --> 1:16:59.625
I guess word got out.

1:17:03.708 --> 1:17:06.458
I… I'm sorry, Ruth.

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:10.458
I'm sorry for everything.

1:17:28.916 --> 1:17:30.291
[cell phone buzzing]

1:17:33.041 --> 1:17:34.041
Hello.

1:17:35.708 --> 1:17:36.750
Hello?

1:17:41.458 --> 1:17:43.625
-What do you want from me?
-[Emily] I'm sorry.

1:17:45.333 --> 1:17:46.250
I'm…

1:17:49.416 --> 1:17:50.625
I'm calling because…

1:17:52.166 --> 1:17:53.333
I read your letters.

1:17:57.458 --> 1:18:00.666
-It's you?
-No, it's not Katherine.

1:18:00.750 --> 1:18:02.416
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1:18:03.000 --> 1:18:04.875
Can I meet you somewhere?

1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:07.041
Anywhere you want.

1:18:25.666 --> 1:18:28.458
[voice mail] This is Keith.
You know what to do.

1:18:28.541 --> 1:18:30.333
Maybe I'll get back to you.

1:18:30.416 --> 1:18:31.416
[line beeps]

1:18:31.500 --> 1:18:35.500
Where the fuck are you?
You were meant to take over an hour ago.

1:18:37.458 --> 1:18:38.541
Call me.

1:18:39.958 --> 1:18:41.458
[engine starts]

1:18:49.458 --> 1:18:50.875
[indistinct chattering]

1:19:00.666 --> 1:19:01.541
[girl] Molly!

1:19:02.333 --> 1:19:03.333
Hi.

1:19:04.250 --> 1:19:06.250
[conversation continues indistinctly]

1:19:22.916 --> 1:19:25.000
[Ruth] Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:19:27.833 --> 1:19:28.916
[child] Thank you.

1:19:53.083 --> 1:19:54.333
Skipping school?

1:19:58.875 --> 1:19:59.875
[Emily] Yeah.

1:20:03.958 --> 1:20:05.250
Skip school a lot?

1:20:07.125 --> 1:20:08.208
Uh-huh.

1:20:11.166 --> 1:20:14.916
We all do things we probably shouldn't,
but we get back on track, right?

1:20:16.208 --> 1:20:17.166
Yeah.

1:20:19.958 --> 1:20:21.916
Wish I'd gone to school more.

1:20:24.375 --> 1:20:25.541
Really liked it.

1:20:31.250 --> 1:20:35.041
My baby sister
was a lot younger than I was,

1:20:35.125 --> 1:20:38.750
so I stayed home,
and I played school with her.

1:20:40.291 --> 1:20:44.625
I was teaching her how to tie her shoes,
but her hands were just so tiny.

1:20:50.958 --> 1:20:52.791
What was… what was your sister like?

1:20:58.625 --> 1:21:03.583
We lived on a farm, and we had this horse,
and she named him "Cheese."

1:21:04.625 --> 1:21:06.333
[chuckles] 'Cause that
was her favorite food.

1:21:06.958 --> 1:21:07.875
[chuckles]

1:21:09.458 --> 1:21:10.958
She was funny.

1:21:14.166 --> 1:21:17.000
I wonder all the time what she looks like…

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.333
what she became.

1:21:25.875 --> 1:21:27.375
She plays the piano.

1:21:30.166 --> 1:21:31.916
She's really good at it too.

1:21:39.583 --> 1:21:41.416
Katherine doesn't know about you.

1:21:44.125 --> 1:21:45.458
She has memories.

1:21:47.583 --> 1:21:49.000
What kinda memories?

1:21:53.291 --> 1:21:57.333
Mmm… Think I should go.
Nobody knows that I'm here.

1:21:57.416 --> 1:21:59.583
Okay. It's all right.

1:22:00.458 --> 1:22:02.583
Thank you for talking to me.

1:22:03.375 --> 1:22:04.208
Um…

1:22:06.791 --> 1:22:08.583
She has a rehearsal this afternoon.

1:22:09.250 --> 1:22:12.750
Cornish Auditorium at 4:00 p.m.

1:22:14.333 --> 1:22:15.333
You can watch her play.

1:22:30.458 --> 1:22:32.458
[uneasy music playing]

1:22:40.958 --> 1:22:45.416
[Ruth] Hey, John.
I have a chance to see Katie.

1:22:46.208 --> 1:22:49.125
And I really don't wanna screw this up,
so I need you to…

1:22:49.791 --> 1:22:52.000
I just need you
to call me back today, okay?

1:22:52.958 --> 1:22:55.458
Okay. Thanks. It's Ruth. Thanks.

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:20.291
[baby crying]

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.375
[crying continues]

1:23:37.416 --> 1:23:38.750
[Steve] Where's your mama?

1:23:41.208 --> 1:23:42.083
Huh?

1:23:43.666 --> 1:23:44.958
Where's your mom?

1:23:47.458 --> 1:23:50.708
-Oh! Shit! Steve.
-[woman] Steve?

1:23:50.791 --> 1:23:51.875
[Keith] Oh shit.

1:23:53.291 --> 1:23:54.375
[Keith] Look, Steve.

1:23:54.916 --> 1:23:57.833
[woman] I'm sorry, Steve.
I'm sorry. Please.

1:23:57.916 --> 1:23:59.875
[Keith] Steve. Look, I just…

1:23:59.958 --> 1:24:01.583
-[Steve] Motherfucker!
-[exclaims]

1:24:01.666 --> 1:24:03.416
-[Keith groaning]
-[Steve grunting]

1:24:04.041 --> 1:24:05.708
-[Hannah] Stop!
-Fuck you!

1:24:06.958 --> 1:24:08.333
[baby crying]

1:24:10.375 --> 1:24:11.291
[Steve] Fuck you!

1:24:12.416 --> 1:24:13.375
[Keith] I'm sorry.

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:16.458
[sobbing] I screwed up, Steve.

1:24:30.583 --> 1:24:34.958
Steve! Please!
Please don't go, please! Steve, please!

1:24:35.041 --> 1:24:36.958
-[sobbing]
-[baby wailing]

1:24:40.250 --> 1:24:41.250
I'm sorry.

1:24:47.291 --> 1:24:48.291
[breathing heavily]

1:25:14.041 --> 1:25:16.750
-Uh, I'm here for John Ingram, please.
-[receptionist] Okay.

1:25:18.333 --> 1:25:20.166
Hi, is Mr. Ingram available?

1:25:21.375 --> 1:25:22.750
Okay, thank you.

1:25:22.833 --> 1:25:24.833
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Mr. Ingram is away this week.

1:25:24.916 --> 1:25:27.291
-I can give him a message.
-You can't just…

1:25:27.375 --> 1:25:29.833
[receptionist] I'm afraid
I just don't have him right now.

1:25:30.833 --> 1:25:32.041
[panting]

1:25:45.250 --> 1:25:47.333
[Ruth] Hey. Hey, is your dad here?

1:25:47.958 --> 1:25:50.125
Uh, no. He's away.

1:25:50.208 --> 1:25:51.958
-Is your mom here?
-[boy] Yeah.

1:25:52.041 --> 1:25:53.791
I need to talk to her. Can you go get her?

1:25:53.875 --> 1:25:56.083
-Go get her. Go get her, please.
-Mom!

1:25:56.166 --> 1:25:58.250
I… Yeah. Sure.

1:26:04.083 --> 1:26:06.708
Mom? Somebody's here for Dad.

1:26:08.916 --> 1:26:10.041
Mom!

1:26:28.166 --> 1:26:29.625
-[man] Get down!
-[Corey] Ruth!

1:26:29.708 --> 1:26:32.083
[screaming]

1:26:32.166 --> 1:26:34.291
I'm getting the keys!
I'm getting the keys!

1:26:42.416 --> 1:26:43.541
[door opens]

1:26:43.625 --> 1:26:47.125
Oh, no, no, no.
Get the fuck off my property.

1:26:47.208 --> 1:26:49.666
Get in the house now.
You got a lot of nerve coming here.

1:26:49.750 --> 1:26:51.750
-I need to talk to John right away.
-[Liz] How dare you?

1:26:51.833 --> 1:26:53.250
[Ruth] I'll leave. Tell me where he is.

1:26:53.333 --> 1:26:55.375
This is not our problem.
You're not his client.

1:26:55.458 --> 1:26:56.791
I have a chance to see my sister,

1:26:56.875 --> 1:26:58.875
and I just need to know,
can I go by myself?

1:26:58.958 --> 1:27:01.333
-Do I have to take him with me?
-I don't give a shit.

1:27:01.416 --> 1:27:03.958
She was taken away from you
because of your choices.

1:27:04.041 --> 1:27:07.375
Look, please don't talk to me
about choices right now, okay?

1:27:07.458 --> 1:27:10.500
Listen, no one forced you to kill that man
or lie your way into my house.

1:27:10.583 --> 1:27:12.750
Okay, you know what?
I'm sorry for the lies.

1:27:12.833 --> 1:27:15.208
I'm sorry for everything
that happened here.

1:27:15.291 --> 1:27:18.708
I went to prison for half my life,
so I think I've more than paid for it.

1:27:18.791 --> 1:27:22.208
You were sent to prison!
You have to take responsibility for that.

1:27:22.291 --> 1:27:24.708
Oh my God. I said I did it.
Can you tell me where John is?

1:27:24.791 --> 1:27:27.416
[Liz] John would tell you exactly
what I'm telling you right now.

1:27:27.500 --> 1:27:29.833
You lost your opportunity. Lost it!

1:27:30.625 --> 1:27:33.125
John looks at you. He sees someone
who deserves a second chance.

1:27:33.208 --> 1:27:34.625
I don't see that.

1:27:34.708 --> 1:27:37.166
I hear someone
who'd say anything to get what she wants.

1:27:37.250 --> 1:27:39.291
You would do exactly
the same thing for your kids.

1:27:39.375 --> 1:27:40.375
[Liz] No. Don't go there.

1:27:40.458 --> 1:27:42.458
Don't even pretend this is about her.

1:27:42.541 --> 1:27:43.833
Exactly! I was protecting her!

1:27:43.916 --> 1:27:46.166
-You are not a victim!
-I said I did it!

1:27:46.250 --> 1:27:47.416
All right? That's bullshit!

1:27:47.500 --> 1:27:50.375
-I had to make a choice!
-Face it, you traumatized her.

1:27:50.458 --> 1:27:53.583
-Do not even pretend this is about her!
-I fucking said I did it!

1:27:53.666 --> 1:27:56.166
She was only five years old!

1:27:56.750 --> 1:27:59.708
She was only five years old!

1:28:03.541 --> 1:28:04.666
[sobs] She was…

1:28:10.416 --> 1:28:12.041
[exhales shakily] Oh fuck.

1:28:15.875 --> 1:28:17.125
What happened, Ruth?

1:28:18.541 --> 1:28:20.666
[Mac] I just want you
to consider your little sister.

1:28:20.750 --> 1:28:22.208
[Ruth] I've got a gun in this house,

1:28:22.291 --> 1:28:25.125
and I swear to God,
they come in this house, I'm gonna use it.

1:28:25.833 --> 1:28:28.000
Get… Where are you going?

1:28:29.291 --> 1:28:31.041
How many times do I gotta tell you?

1:28:31.125 --> 1:28:33.833
You come to that door,
and I swear to fucking God…

1:28:33.916 --> 1:28:37.541
We are not leaving! We are not leaving!

1:28:38.833 --> 1:28:42.375
Corey, get off my fucking porch!

1:28:42.458 --> 1:28:44.083
Go ahead, try it.

1:28:44.166 --> 1:28:46.541
-Go ahead and try it, Corey. Try…
-Ruth!

1:28:47.208 --> 1:28:48.583
[gunshot]

1:28:52.291 --> 1:28:58.000
[gasping] Katie? Hey, Katie?
Katie? Katie? Katie?

1:29:01.583 --> 1:29:02.416
No!

1:29:02.500 --> 1:29:06.208
Katie, Katie, Katie.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1:29:20.916 --> 1:29:22.125
It was my fault.

1:29:23.916 --> 1:29:25.291
I did it. [sniffles]

1:29:43.458 --> 1:29:44.666
[softly] Shit.

1:29:49.625 --> 1:29:51.166
What time is your meeting?

1:29:51.666 --> 1:29:53.916
[Ruth] It's at 4:00.
I'm not gonna make it.

1:30:28.625 --> 1:30:29.791
I'm hungry.

1:30:31.375 --> 1:30:33.708
I know. Food's coming. It's coming.

1:30:36.166 --> 1:30:39.500
[waitress] Okay, here you go, sweetie.
The full stack.

1:30:43.000 --> 1:30:46.250
Eat as much as you want.
As much as you can.

1:31:01.208 --> 1:31:04.416
Katie, I'm so sorry I made you do that.

1:31:08.333 --> 1:31:09.375
Do what?

1:31:15.166 --> 1:31:16.583
[vehicle approaching]

1:31:17.791 --> 1:31:19.000
[vehicle door opens]

1:31:22.375 --> 1:31:24.500
[policemen speaking indistinctly]

1:31:34.333 --> 1:31:35.625
Katie. [sniffles]

1:31:36.666 --> 1:31:38.125
I'm gonna go somewhere, okay?

1:31:39.500 --> 1:31:42.250
And I want you to stay here
and eat all you can, okay?

1:31:43.250 --> 1:31:44.166
Hey.

1:31:44.250 --> 1:31:45.125
[Katherine] Hmm.

1:31:47.166 --> 1:31:49.416
Katie, look at me. Look at me.

1:31:50.541 --> 1:31:52.250
[sniffles] No matter what happens…

1:31:56.541 --> 1:32:00.208
I'm always gonna love you.
No matter what, okay?

1:32:02.916 --> 1:32:05.458
-I love you too.
-I know you do.

1:32:08.625 --> 1:32:09.625
Eat up.

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:40.291
[Liz] You go ahead. I'll see you in there.

1:32:40.875 --> 1:32:42.333
-Okay.
-[cell phone buzzing]

1:32:44.583 --> 1:32:45.583
Hi, I'm here.

1:32:46.250 --> 1:32:47.791
[Steve] Does Katie know what you did?

1:32:48.583 --> 1:32:49.500
[Ruth] What?

1:32:49.583 --> 1:32:51.000
[Steve] I've got a gun to her head.

1:32:52.166 --> 1:32:53.083
Bullshit.

1:32:53.166 --> 1:32:56.375
[girl screaming,
whimpering over cell phone]

1:32:58.375 --> 1:32:59.500
What do you want?

1:33:00.875 --> 1:33:01.708
Huh?

1:33:01.791 --> 1:33:04.125
[Steve] Harbor Island. 16th and Lander.

1:33:04.791 --> 1:33:07.833
You come alone. Or I blow her head off.

1:33:08.500 --> 1:33:10.666
-[girl whimpers]
-[Ruth] Don't you hurt her.

1:33:11.250 --> 1:33:12.875
Don't you lay a finger on her.

1:33:12.958 --> 1:33:14.208
What do you care?

1:33:16.291 --> 1:33:17.791
"Life goes on," right?

1:33:23.750 --> 1:33:25.750
[uneasy music playing]

1:33:27.500 --> 1:33:28.750
Everything okay?

1:33:28.833 --> 1:33:32.166
Yeah. She's not here.
But I have the address where she is,

1:33:32.250 --> 1:33:34.541
so you can just drop me off,
and I'll be out of your hair.

1:33:34.625 --> 1:33:36.250
-You sure?
-Yeah. It's not far.

1:33:38.583 --> 1:33:39.958
[girl sobbing]

1:33:43.708 --> 1:33:44.750
[cell phone ringing]

1:33:51.291 --> 1:33:52.333
[sobbing]

1:33:57.458 --> 1:33:58.458
[line disconnects]

1:34:01.958 --> 1:34:02.958
[breathing heavily]

1:34:12.708 --> 1:34:14.166
What are we doing here?

1:34:15.333 --> 1:34:17.000
Ruth, what's going on? Talk to me.

1:34:17.083 --> 1:34:19.625
-Somebody has Katie.
-What?

1:34:19.708 --> 1:34:20.708
[cell phone buzzing]

1:34:23.250 --> 1:34:25.333
-[Ruth] I'm here.
-[whispering] Shit.

1:34:25.416 --> 1:34:26.583
[Steve] Go through the gate.

1:34:32.583 --> 1:34:33.666
Shit.

1:34:39.708 --> 1:34:41.625
[Steve] Take a left.
Keep walking to the water.

1:34:42.500 --> 1:34:43.791
There's a red conveyor.

1:34:45.875 --> 1:34:48.291
-[Ruth] I'm at it.
-[Steve] There's a gray building.

1:34:48.375 --> 1:34:50.541
-What?
-[Steve] There's a gray building.

1:34:54.750 --> 1:34:55.750
I see it.

1:34:57.833 --> 1:34:59.666
[Steve] Through the door next to the van.

1:35:35.791 --> 1:35:38.083
-I'm here. Let her go.
-[Steve] Come inside right now.

1:35:43.125 --> 1:35:44.708
Come inside now!

1:35:46.375 --> 1:35:48.541
[girl whimpering]

1:36:22.375 --> 1:36:23.958
[Steve] Get on the ground right here.

1:36:26.708 --> 1:36:28.875
Fucking get on the ground
right fucking now!

1:36:33.791 --> 1:36:35.583
-She has nothing to do with this.
-Stop.

1:36:35.666 --> 1:36:37.458
[Emily sobbing]

1:36:51.500 --> 1:36:53.583
[playing "Everything in Its Right Place"]

1:37:11.500 --> 1:37:13.250
-Let her go.
-Get on the fucking ground.

1:37:14.541 --> 1:37:16.458
-She's got nothing to do--
-On the ground, now.

1:37:16.541 --> 1:37:17.666
[Emily whimpering]

1:37:19.250 --> 1:37:22.291
[Steve] Right here. So you can watch.

1:37:31.291 --> 1:37:33.000
[Ruth] You're making a mistake.

1:37:34.375 --> 1:37:35.500
Let her go. She's innocent.

1:37:35.583 --> 1:37:38.000
-[Steve] Now you give a shit?
-She's just a kid.

1:37:41.166 --> 1:37:42.166
So was I.

1:37:55.833 --> 1:37:57.750
Now you're gonna watch your sister die.

1:37:57.833 --> 1:37:59.041
[Emily sobbing]

1:38:00.500 --> 1:38:02.250
-[Emily] No! No! No!
-Your dad didn't--

1:38:02.333 --> 1:38:03.833
You do not talk about him!

1:38:06.666 --> 1:38:08.791
You do not ever talk about him!

1:38:20.041 --> 1:38:21.041
[whimpers]

1:38:28.583 --> 1:38:30.250
He talked about you that day.

1:38:32.916 --> 1:38:36.750
He said you boys would give up your room
so we had a place to go.

1:38:38.250 --> 1:38:39.458
Shut the fuck up.

1:38:42.333 --> 1:38:43.541
He was kind.

1:38:51.250 --> 1:38:53.166
And I am so sorry
I took him away from you.

1:38:53.250 --> 1:38:54.875
[Steve] It's too fucking late.

1:39:18.750 --> 1:39:20.541
[sobbing]

1:39:24.583 --> 1:39:27.041
[Ruth] You think this is gonna
make you feel better?

1:39:30.416 --> 1:39:31.833
But life doesn't go on.

1:39:31.916 --> 1:39:34.500
Shut up. Shut up.

1:39:39.125 --> 1:39:41.000
You leave behind everything you love.

1:39:47.958 --> 1:39:49.125
I'm so sorry.

1:39:52.416 --> 1:39:53.416
[Steve screams]

1:39:55.750 --> 1:39:56.666

Excuse me, brother.
Where's Ruth Slater at?

1:43:45.583 --> 1:43:46.750
That's 'em right there.

1:43:49.083 --> 1:43:51.708
[Vince] Gentlemen, she's my parolee.

1:43:52.666 --> 1:43:55.125
I mean, unless you have a charge,
I'll take custody.

1:43:55.625 --> 1:43:58.041
-Let's go, uncuff her.
-[officer] Let her go.

1:44:16.083 --> 1:44:17.250
You okay?
