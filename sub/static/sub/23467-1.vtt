WEBVTT

00:05.906 --> 00:08.209
The Assassination
of Gianni Versace.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.744
All new,
Wednesdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.982
FX presents Baskets.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.085
MAN: Get on with it!

00:20.388 --> 00:22.090
Looks like a position
has become available

00:22.123 --> 00:24.525
in a traveling Russian circus.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.929
You American, you all
want to be star, huh?

00:28.962 --> 00:30.264
You're fired.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.365
DALE:
How did the, uh,

00:31.399 --> 00:33.267
-They took a vote

00:33.301 --> 00:36.170
and decided to remove you
as president.

00:36.204 --> 00:37.538
It's Baskets Career College,

00:37.571 --> 00:39.673
as in Dale Baskets.

00:39.707 --> 00:40.941
Let's take a look
at this will.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.343
-Yes.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.777
MRS. BASKETS:
Money's no problem for me.

00:43.811 --> 00:45.279
I've come into
a little nest egg.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.847
My mother died.

00:46.880 --> 00:48.082
KEN:
My daughters and I

00:48.116 --> 00:49.917
run a carpeting
business together.

00:49.950 --> 00:51.919
I find it fascinating.

00:51.952 --> 00:54.388
-Especially that you have
a family business.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.590
It all looks so fun.

00:56.624 --> 00:57.858
You're not thinking about buying
this place, are you?

00:57.891 --> 00:59.059
MRS. BASKETS:
What do you think?

00:59.093 --> 01:03.030
-"Baskets Family Rodeo."
-I'm just a performer.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.566
I, you know,
I'm-I'm not a business, so...

01:05.599 --> 01:07.101
I'll be handling the business

01:07.135 --> 01:09.069
because I'm a business-minded
businessman.

01:09.103 --> 01:11.239
Who means business.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.788
Don't eat my hat.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.157
DALE:
Three, two, one.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.894
I want my mother
to see my horses, so I want you

01:33.927 --> 01:35.996
to wash 'em, wax 'em and buff
'em, make sure you make 'em

01:36.029 --> 01:37.898
look like one of them
beer commercials. You know?

01:37.931 --> 01:40.434
-You got it, boss.
-Okeydokey.

01:40.468 --> 01:42.102
Stick 'em in the stall.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.104
Get the shit out of their eyes.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.315
You have any circuses
coming through town?

01:54.348 --> 01:57.117
-Nope.

01:57.151 --> 01:58.486
Hey, there's nothing
I can offer you

01:58.519 --> 02:00.120
that's as steady as that rodeo.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.622
Hey, plus...

02:01.655 --> 02:02.656
you're in management there.

02:02.690 --> 02:03.791
I mean, that's a step up.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.125
Yeah, but I just sit
behind a desk.

02:05.159 --> 02:07.127
I'd rather get back to clowning.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.629
You know,
I'm actually a clown, too.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.264
-Kablammo.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.466
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.701
But now this is my job,

02:13.734 --> 02:16.036
and Kablammo is just the icing.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.006
Why were you called Kablammo?

02:19.039 --> 02:21.775
Uh, it's 'cause I used to try
to light my farts on fire,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.944
but then it got...
well, things happened

02:23.977 --> 02:26.380
and my insurance lapsed.

02:26.414 --> 02:30.218
-Howdy, Dale.

02:30.251 --> 02:33.787
Baskets Family Rodeo now owns
three beautiful stallions.

02:33.821 --> 02:35.356
-Good for you, Dale.
-Yep.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.725
Bought 'em myself.
Whittled the guy down

02:37.758 --> 02:39.827
on the price a bunch.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.229
He was real poor, that guy.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.630
Oh, look, here's some pictures

02:42.663 --> 02:44.332
of the horsies
if you want to see 'em.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.033
You know, I'm a novice

02:46.066 --> 02:47.134
to this, uh, rodeo thing,

02:47.167 --> 02:48.135
but I've already acquired
three horses

02:48.168 --> 02:49.637
and some cowboys.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.672
Have you hired one clown yet?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.807
Uh, yeah. I was just, um...

02:53.841 --> 02:56.410
I was just about to... Oop.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.212
I was just about to do that.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.547
-Um...
-Mm-hmm.

02:59.580 --> 03:02.015
So...

03:03.951 --> 03:05.886
You've never worked
in an office before.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.256
You have to dial nine.
You've got to dial nine.

03:08.289 --> 03:10.258
That's at every office
across the United States.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.727
You know what,
I will hire the clowns,

03:13.761 --> 03:15.596
and you...

03:15.629 --> 03:17.731
just man the phones.

03:17.765 --> 03:18.699
You're the phone guy now.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.033
Phones are a vital part

03:20.067 --> 03:22.069
of a business.
You know, they're a portal

03:22.102 --> 03:23.404
to who might be your customers,

03:23.437 --> 03:25.072
so working the phone,
being the gatekeeper's

03:25.105 --> 03:26.707
a very important job.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.509
Don't pooh-pooh it

03:28.542 --> 03:30.778
just 'cause you don't know how
to do-do it.

03:34.615 --> 03:37.217
Answer it.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.520
I'm not the phone person.
This isn't my training, I...

03:39.553 --> 03:40.654
Answer the phone.

03:42.790 --> 03:45.058
Hello?

03:47.127 --> 03:49.397
Baskets Family Rodeo.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.599
This is Chip Baskets.
How can I help you?

03:51.632 --> 03:53.701
You've got to be courteous.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.068
Who would you like to speak to?

03:55.102 --> 03:56.437
Christine? Okay.

03:56.470 --> 03:58.872
Let me just transfer you,
uh, over, okay?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.774
:
Just transfer that to Mom.

04:02.576 --> 04:05.045
Just transfer it over.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.315
Okay, so I just, um...

04:07.348 --> 04:09.116
-I'm just gonna transfer.

04:09.149 --> 04:10.951
-Just transfer... trans... Chip.
-I'm gonna transfer you

04:10.984 --> 04:12.286
-in just a second, hold on.
-Tran...

04:12.320 --> 04:14.722
-Call coming in, Mom.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.956
What the hell are you...?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.627
Okay, Mom, you have a phone...

04:19.660 --> 04:22.095
Oh, my God.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.633
Hello?

04:25.666 --> 04:26.767
You have a call coming through.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.235
-Okay.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.237
-I already have a phone here,
honey. -Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.406
Oh, God.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.178
Hello, Baskets Family Rodeo.

04:38.211 --> 04:42.015
This is the owner and CEO,
Christine Baskets.

04:42.049 --> 04:45.419
What? You're kidding.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.755
Channel 9 News is coming

04:47.788 --> 04:50.290
-to the rodeo!

04:50.324 --> 04:52.259
That's great, Mom.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.462
MRS. BASKETS:
This is big-time. Danielle Mana

04:54.495 --> 04:57.931
from the 4:00 news
is going to come on Friday.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.806
Chip, you should not be working
on the phones.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.541
-You should be getting clowns.
-Yeah, I...

05:07.575 --> 05:10.344
Dale insists that I have
to do the phones, I guess.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.946
-That was a business
hypothetical. -Well, whatever.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.716
I've got a million things to do.
Channel 9!

05:15.749 --> 05:16.950
It's exciting, Mom.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.151
MRS. BASKETS:
I love it.

05:18.185 --> 05:19.787
You have a lot to learn

05:19.820 --> 05:22.055
about office politics. A lot.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.395
It's half past.

05:27.428 --> 05:29.863
-She's probably feeding

05:29.897 --> 05:31.632
some bucking bronco
or something.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.467
It's always something
down at the rodeo.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.002
Why a rodeo, anyway?

05:35.035 --> 05:36.837
-She's got a screw loose.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.039
We're all going to start
losing our marbles soon.

05:41.008 --> 05:42.676
She bought it for her son.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.578
Jeez.
-Yeah.

05:44.612 --> 05:47.347
Look, I give it about two weeks.

05:47.381 --> 05:49.016
Well, it's not really
a business.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.684
It's only a gesture.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.353
Oh, sorry, girls.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.988
What a day.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.357
But I brought champagne!

05:57.391 --> 05:59.359
-Oh.

05:59.393 --> 06:01.629
I'm gonna be on TV.

06:03.731 --> 06:05.365
I'm so honored

06:05.399 --> 06:08.368
to be on the 4:00 p.m. news.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.838
You know, I don't even watch
the network news anymore.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.840
NAN: My VCR's broken.
I don't watch anything.

06:15.643 --> 06:18.712
I'm thinking
about wearing my hair up.

06:18.746 --> 06:21.782
-Or down.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.751
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.019
-You know, I thought

06:26.053 --> 06:28.422
I'd get something new,
'cause I lost 20 pounds.

06:28.456 --> 06:30.424
-Oh, you look great.
-Yes.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.026
It's just a shame that
those cameras add 20 pounds.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.629
I mean, everybody on television

06:35.663 --> 06:37.030
is just a toothpick.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.198
-Oh.
-And you better make sure

06:38.231 --> 06:39.399
you don't get something
that makes you sweat.

06:39.433 --> 06:41.769
NAN: Oh, but they have
these wonderful sweat pads

06:41.802 --> 06:43.704
that you just pin
right into your jacket.

06:43.737 --> 06:44.938
WANDA:
Yeah, you should get those.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.107
NAN:
So, what are you gonna wear?

06:47.140 --> 06:48.275
Oh.

06:49.577 --> 06:51.144
What do you think of this?

06:51.178 --> 06:52.412
KEN :
I like that.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.147
Too Coney Island.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.949
That's the problem
with that one.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.585
What about this?

06:57.618 --> 06:59.219
I like that.

06:59.252 --> 07:02.289
God, I never realized
I had so many pastels.

07:02.322 --> 07:03.891
God, what am I...

07:03.924 --> 07:05.258
I thought I was an autumn.

07:05.292 --> 07:06.994
I think I'm a summer.

07:07.027 --> 07:09.597
Can you move that mug or
whatever that is out of the way?

07:09.630 --> 07:11.599
It's like we're still talking
on the phone.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.834
-Oh, I like that.

07:13.867 --> 07:16.470
-This is a blanket.
-Well...

07:16.504 --> 07:17.805
You're not even
paying attention.

07:17.838 --> 07:18.939
I am paying attention.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.140
I liked it.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.942
I mean, the fabric
would look good on you.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.076
I don't want to look bad

07:23.110 --> 07:25.278
-on TV.
-You won't.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.515
-I know.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.016
Can you believe it?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.417
Christine,
why don't you just go out

07:30.450 --> 07:31.852
and buy something new, honey?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.153
I've already tried everything on

07:33.186 --> 07:34.588
at the Dress Barn.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.657
-I'm in between sizes.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.091
Well, I tell you what.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.693
You're a very talented woman.

07:39.727 --> 07:41.695
Why don't you
just whip something together?

07:41.729 --> 07:44.464
I mean, remember?
You sewed that button on for me.

07:44.498 --> 07:45.599
It's still there.

07:45.633 --> 07:46.767
A button?

07:46.800 --> 07:49.469
They teach animals to do that.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.438
I don't know.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.541
I used to sew years ago.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.609
I was pretty good.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.511
Well, I think
you're still a good sewer,

07:57.545 --> 07:59.847
and you can do this.
I believe in you.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.315
You're Christine Baskets,
rodeo owner.

08:02.349 --> 08:03.684
You can do it.

08:03.717 --> 08:05.318
Oh, God.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.371
DALE :
Good morning, everybody.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.040
The first PA announcement
goes out to Christine Baskets.

08:27.074 --> 08:28.976
Please report to the main arena

08:29.009 --> 08:31.745
to meet the costars
for the Channel 9 interview.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.146
That's over and out.

08:33.180 --> 08:34.715
One moment.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.486
Ta-da!

08:39.519 --> 08:42.055
-Yes, Mother.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.491
-Oh, they're beautiful.
-I know.

08:44.524 --> 08:47.327
Danielle is gonna want
to see these.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.230
-This is Bucky Boy, that's Lady,
and that's Bucky Girl. -Oh.

08:50.263 --> 08:52.399
Well, can we change one to Ester

08:52.432 --> 08:54.234
for Meemaw?

08:54.267 --> 08:56.436
-CHIP: Hey, Mom.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.338
Hey, Mr. Head Clown.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.540
You find any clowns yet?

09:00.574 --> 09:02.209
No, but I had an idea for a...

09:02.242 --> 09:04.712
-for a classified ad,
you know...

09:04.745 --> 09:06.880
"Clowns wanted," honey.
That's it.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.082
This reminds me
of when you were in junior high

09:09.116 --> 09:10.183
and you'd come to me,

09:10.217 --> 09:11.518
"Mom, I haven't read...

09:11.551 --> 09:13.220
the Little House
on the Prairie."

09:13.253 --> 09:14.788
Well, who has?

09:14.822 --> 09:16.223
Just make up some stuff.

09:16.256 --> 09:19.292
Laura Ingalls dot, dot, dot.

09:19.326 --> 09:22.062
I didn't ask for any of this.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.898
I'm sorry. I'm sure
you'll find someone, honey.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.834
You'll find some good people.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.304
Oh, stop!

09:31.338 --> 09:33.206
Stop! The horse bit me!

09:33.240 --> 09:34.908
-Oh, shoo! Shoo.
-Mom, Mom, Mom.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.611
Oh, God.

09:37.645 --> 09:38.746
MAN:
Everyone out!

09:38.779 --> 09:41.014
-CHIP: Dale, Dale!

09:42.015 --> 09:43.416
Give the horse space!

09:43.450 --> 09:45.552
Give the horse space!

09:45.585 --> 09:47.420
Oh, what happened?

09:47.454 --> 09:49.222
I mean, good gosh.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.391
-They're crazy.
-DALE: That horse goosed me.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.826
Mom, they were eating
out of my hat.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.962
We need to fix this.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.296
It's your fault.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.639
-It's open.

10:05.673 --> 10:07.074
MARTHA:
Hi, Mrs. Baskets.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.275
Is Chip ready?

10:08.308 --> 10:09.943
Hi, Martha.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.079
Chip, Martha's here!

10:12.112 --> 10:13.747
CHIP:
Okay, I'll be down in a second.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.482
Okay, that's fine.

10:15.515 --> 10:17.517
Hey, could you take
all these donations

10:17.550 --> 10:19.653
down to the Goodwill
on First for me

10:19.687 --> 10:21.588
on your way to the rodeo?

10:21.621 --> 10:23.156
You're getting rid
of a lot of stuff.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.025
I am.

10:25.058 --> 10:27.928
Wow. Hey,
is this your wedding dress?

10:27.961 --> 10:29.797
Oh, that disaster.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.332
I still remember
the look on Nathan's face

10:32.365 --> 10:34.835
when he saw me
coming down the aisle.

10:34.868 --> 10:36.036
He hadn't seen it yet.

10:36.069 --> 10:38.638
His whole face dropped.

10:38.672 --> 10:41.108
I was so embarrassed.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.642
I didn't even know you sewed,

10:42.676 --> 10:44.111
-Mrs. Baskets.
-Oh, yes.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.013
I sewed everything.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.549
I even got caught up
in the doily craze for a while.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.185
But Nathan always said
they didn't look good.

10:52.219 --> 10:54.154
But I didn't care,
'cause I loved sewing.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.989
I love the feel of material,

10:56.023 --> 10:58.491
working the machine, and...

10:58.525 --> 10:59.893
It took that dress

10:59.927 --> 11:02.029
to convince me
that he was right.

11:02.062 --> 11:04.664
I just didn't have the eye
for it, so...

11:04.698 --> 11:07.200
I just quit sewing.
I gave it up.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.203
Well, I think it's really good,
Mrs. Baskets.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.372
That's so sweet of you, Martha.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.341
If you'd like it,
you could have it.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.209
No, I'm gonna hold off
on marriage

11:16.243 --> 11:19.479
till I find out what
this polyamorous stuff is about.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.482
Polyester-- that was
my favorite material to sew.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.351
You could do anything with it.

11:24.384 --> 11:27.254
Well, I'm not gonna screw up
this interview for Channel 9.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.089
I got a pattern this time.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.657
I'm gonna make
a beautiful dress.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.325
They're gonna love it.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.562
: Chip!
-Yeah.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.330
Oh.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.699
Hey, Chip.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.268
Well, you kids should shove off.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.670
Okay. Bye, Mrs. Baskets.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.874
If you want to keep the dress,
Martha, feel free to.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.376
-I'll get the door.
-Uh-huh. Okay.

11:53.580 --> 11:55.548
Old man got it.

11:55.582 --> 11:57.417
Come on, Junior.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.852
Howdy, guys.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.620
-Must be nice to just...

12:00.653 --> 12:02.455
pussyfoot your life away.

12:02.489 --> 12:04.624
-Bunch of pussyfooters.
-JUNIOR: Yeah, that's right.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.560
Just pussyfooting around,
bonesmoker.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.462
Bonesmoker?

12:09.496 --> 12:11.865
Sir, I'm a metrosexual.

12:11.899 --> 12:15.435
Huh. You didn't say
"heterosexual."

12:15.468 --> 12:17.737
Metropolitan sexual
is what I mean.

12:17.771 --> 12:20.140
By the way,
I don't appreciate being set up.

12:20.173 --> 12:22.109
You turned my horses against me.

12:22.142 --> 12:24.311
Now I can't even set foot
in our own rodeo.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.445
Did we?

12:25.478 --> 12:26.814
Hey, Clyde.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.615
Do you remember turning

12:28.648 --> 12:30.550
the horses against Dinky?

12:30.583 --> 12:32.619
DALE:
Save it, Clyde-- I know how

12:32.652 --> 12:35.455
this works-- I'm supposed to go
into the horse corral first

12:35.488 --> 12:37.424
as to establish
who's the pack leader.

12:37.457 --> 12:39.726
But you guys sent
the horses in first, and now

12:39.759 --> 12:43.096
-they have no respect for me.
-Whatever you say, Dinky.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.465
Why do you keep
calling me Dinky? -No, no, no.

12:45.498 --> 12:49.402
Not you. The little man who
pulls the strings inside you.

12:49.436 --> 12:51.138
That's...that's not his na...

12:51.171 --> 12:53.807
I don't have a man pulling
the strings inside of me!

12:53.841 --> 12:55.809
God, I'm getting all flustered!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.477
I'll tell you this,
if those horses

12:57.510 --> 12:58.979
ain't eating out of my hand

12:59.012 --> 13:00.780
by the time
that local news reporter

13:00.814 --> 13:03.016
whips out her microphone,
I'm gonna smack

13:03.050 --> 13:05.919
that booger-blocker
right off your face.

13:05.953 --> 13:07.787
All right.

13:07.821 --> 13:10.323
DALE :
Oh, God! Chip, you gotta get

13:10.357 --> 13:12.025
this thing off my face! Please!

13:12.059 --> 13:14.694
-Take it off...

13:14.727 --> 13:16.329
Ow!

13:16.363 --> 13:19.299
There's been a mutiny--
my men have turned on me,

13:19.332 --> 13:22.202
-and I need you... Chip!
-Let me see what I can do.

13:22.235 --> 13:23.837
Chip!

13:23.871 --> 13:25.939
I hear what you're saying,
I mean, Dale can be annoying,

13:25.973 --> 13:27.941
but he... he means well.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.642
RAMBLING COWBOY:
So what?

13:29.676 --> 13:31.344
I ain't his mama.

13:31.378 --> 13:32.812
COWBOY: Dinky ain't my boss.
We'd rather go

13:32.846 --> 13:35.448
through a clown like you--
you understand us.

13:35.482 --> 13:36.716
No. No management for me.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.485
I just want
to get back to clowning.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.687
RAMBLING COWBOY: Them horses,
they come to us crazy.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.323
They was wild.

13:43.356 --> 13:46.693
They got slowed down
on them tranquilizers.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.195
What?

13:48.228 --> 13:52.199
Jim Jack Mahoney is what.

13:52.232 --> 13:55.202
-That guy can't be trusted.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.370
Okay, wait a minute.
So you're telling me

13:57.404 --> 14:01.674
that Dale bought sedated horses
from this Jim Jack guy?

14:01.708 --> 14:03.710
-Oh, I'm just sayin'.
-Look, Dinky needed

14:03.743 --> 14:05.845
to take a fall
off his wild horse, see.

14:05.879 --> 14:09.149
Wasn't my place to school him
on the ways of Jim Jack Mahoney.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.652
I think I know what
you're saying. I think.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.321
You're the only person I know

14:14.354 --> 14:17.224
-who's been on the news,
Mrs. Baskets. -Thank you.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.592
Actually, you know,
my cousin was on the news

14:19.626 --> 14:23.563
for dumping grease into a storm
drain, but that wasn't as fun.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.865
Well, it's all been
a whirlwind for me.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.568
This rodeo has changed my life.

14:28.601 --> 14:32.339
You're like Cinderella, and
I'm one of those helper rats.

14:32.372 --> 14:33.740
Ow!

14:33.773 --> 14:36.409
-Sorry.
-Careful, Martha.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.945
-Sorry.
-Geez.

14:37.978 --> 14:41.414
Well, just think of me
as your fairy godmother.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.083
-Okay.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.618
You know, I hope
you're not too hard on Chip

14:45.652 --> 14:47.454
if he can't find any clowns.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.556
I know he's been trying
really hard.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.591
Well, I hope so--
I bought the place for him.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.226
Oh, shit!

14:53.260 --> 14:54.594
Damn it.

14:54.627 --> 14:56.896
I've sewn the sleeve
to the dress.

14:56.930 --> 14:59.732
Martha, we've got
to concentrate.

14:59.766 --> 15:03.436
Less about your personal life,
more sewing.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.105
Sorry, Mrs. Baskets.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.607
Do you want to turn me
back into a pumpkin?

15:07.640 --> 15:09.943
I would love that.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.153
DALE: Well, you tell me--
you're the veterinarian.

15:20.187 --> 15:22.922
These horses need to be
on camera tomorrow.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.825
When I bought 'em, they were
just docile angels. They were.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.795
: Right. They'd probably
been injected with Xylazine.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.897
That's what we give the big guys

15:30.930 --> 15:33.766
when we're doing a little
dental work or a castration.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.835
Fine. Is it possible
to get a lifetime supply

15:35.868 --> 15:37.770
of Xylazine, then?

15:37.804 --> 15:39.472
Not really something
to joke about.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.842
Tranquilizers are for licensed
medical professionals only.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.945
Drug-addicted teenagers fry
their brains on that stuff.

15:45.979 --> 15:47.447
You got swindled, Dale.

15:47.480 --> 15:50.283
-You know what,
this is your fault!

15:50.317 --> 15:52.919
You work at a rodeo--
you should know about horses!

15:52.952 --> 15:54.787
Do you have a rabies shot
for him? I think he's

15:54.821 --> 15:56.523
starting to foam at the mouth
from the horse bite.

15:56.556 --> 15:59.192
I only have rabies shots
for horses.

15:59.226 --> 16:01.328
I am not authorized
to work on humans,

16:01.361 --> 16:03.530
if you're asking me
to bend the rules.

16:03.563 --> 16:05.865
You know what? I should be
in an air-conditioned office

16:05.898 --> 16:07.800
yelling at people.
Thank you.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.786
Thank you for calling
Baskets Family Rodeo.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.488
This is Chip Baskets,
head clown

16:28.521 --> 16:30.357
and Vice President
of Phone Operations.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.959
DALE: Well, there you go, Chip.
Was that so hard?

16:32.992 --> 16:35.562
Dale, good. Listen, um,
Mom and this local news thing

16:35.595 --> 16:38.065
and the horses,
I'm a little worried about it.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.333
Chip, look, these horses
need to be sedated.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.969
So you're gonna ask one
of your riffraff cowboy buddies

16:43.002 --> 16:45.405
which drug dealer
in the Bakersfield area

16:45.438 --> 16:49.176
sells tranquilizers to tweens,
to junkies, to horses.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.843
-Thank you.

16:53.546 --> 16:55.515
And then he was sitting
on a donkey.

16:57.250 --> 17:00.887
I just need to know where
I can score horse tranquilizers.

17:00.920 --> 17:03.190
I got a man.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.176
Yes.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.044
You're the, uh...

17:25.078 --> 17:27.114
-A girl's gotta eat.
-Yeah, that checks out.

17:27.147 --> 17:28.681
Come on in.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.217
-No.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.358
Don't open your eyes.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.592
KEN :
Yeah, they're closed.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.728
-Okay.
-All right, here we go.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.432
Wow!

17:45.465 --> 17:48.135
-Yeah, my little rodeo gal!

17:48.168 --> 17:50.203
-I love that!

17:50.237 --> 17:52.805
-Oh, that's great!

17:52.839 --> 17:55.808
-Oh, my God, my sleeve.
-Oh.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.879
-That's pretty.
I love that little...

17:59.912 --> 18:02.415
-Oh, the frills, yeah, it's
beautiful.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.551
Oh.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.919
-Sorry, babe. -Oh.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.456
Oh, my God, the back. Oh.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.657
KEN:
Ah.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.092
Oh, neither sleeve's really on.

18:13.126 --> 18:15.328
I'll never be able
to get this done in time.

18:15.362 --> 18:18.064
-You got time; you can do it.
-I don't have time.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.432
It's today--

18:19.466 --> 18:21.468
in 45 minutes,
I have to be there.

18:21.501 --> 18:23.803
Well...

18:23.836 --> 18:25.638
that's not good.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.140
I got to go, Ken.

18:27.174 --> 18:29.376
All right, honey.
I'm here if you need me.

18:30.377 --> 18:32.312
*

18:56.869 --> 18:58.805
WOMAN:
I like that one,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.140
but Jake's gonna like the other,
and it's four dollars less.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.343
This is the most important day
of your life.

19:03.376 --> 19:05.812
CHRISTINE:
Excuse me. This is mine.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.080
*

19:14.854 --> 19:16.989
: Chip will come
through, he's gotta come...

19:17.023 --> 19:19.659
-Dale.
-Oh, good, you got it.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.961
I'll open the gate,
and you can inject those beasts.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.296
I don't think we should do this.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.364
I mean, the horses
are gonna suffer.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.299
Oh, so you want Mom
to suffer, do you?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.534
So Seabiscuit and Secretariat

19:27.567 --> 19:29.369
can just trounce
all over Danielle Mana?

19:29.402 --> 19:31.338
Let's just tell Mom
that we couldn't figure out

19:31.371 --> 19:33.406
the horse thing-- I mean,
she'll understand, right?

19:33.440 --> 19:36.142
-Oh, gosh, I'll
just do it myself. -Dale.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.345
-Hey. Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.
-Calm down.

19:38.378 --> 19:39.846
Don't be a snowflake, Chip!

19:39.879 --> 19:42.215
We're not Ringling Bros.,
we're better than that.

19:42.249 --> 19:43.750
-Listen to me!
-Dale, Dale, Dale.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.188
-Whew!

19:49.222 --> 19:51.991
-I'm fine.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.993
It just went in
a little bit. I'm fine.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.127
That smarted, though.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.533

20:00.567 --> 20:02.502
DALE:
Rodeo's off limits!

20:02.535 --> 20:03.736
No media at the rodeo,

20:03.770 --> 20:05.238
so get your van
with all its bells

20:05.272 --> 20:06.906
and whistles and giddy on out!

20:06.939 --> 20:09.776
We're looking
for Christine Baskets.

20:09.809 --> 20:14.347
-Well, I don't know who that is.
-Hooray, Channel 9!

20:14.381 --> 20:15.615
Oh.

20:18.451 --> 20:20.520
What are you wearing?

20:20.553 --> 20:22.255
Danielle!

20:22.289 --> 20:25.124
I love your news!

20:25.157 --> 20:26.626
-Thank you.
-Oh...

20:26.659 --> 20:28.595
Your report

20:28.628 --> 20:31.364
on dangerous crosswalks
saved my life.

20:31.398 --> 20:34.033
-Thank you. -You look
more beautiful in person.

20:34.066 --> 20:37.470
-It's true, you do.

20:37.504 --> 20:41.541
-These twins are saying
we can't get in.

20:41.574 --> 20:44.076
-Mom, the horses are still...
-Shh...

20:44.110 --> 20:45.812
The horses are sleeping.

20:45.845 --> 20:48.881
-They need their rest.
-Oh, sure.

20:48.915 --> 20:51.318
Well, let's do
the interview out here.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.620
That's great. Let's do it.

20:53.653 --> 20:55.422
CHRISTINE:
Welcome, cameraman!

20:56.523 --> 20:58.425
Wow, he looks like a real pro.

20:58.458 --> 20:59.759
He is.

20:59.792 --> 21:01.127
CHRISTINE:
Well, we're not open

21:01.160 --> 21:03.296
to the public yet,
but we're close.

21:03.330 --> 21:06.299
I have to ask.
I just love your outfit.

21:06.333 --> 21:08.401
-Thank you.

21:08.435 --> 21:10.637
It's Christine Baskets.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.339
You made this?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.407
-I did.
-It's amazing.

21:14.441 --> 21:16.643
And this is my son Chip.

21:16.676 --> 21:19.979
He's a French-trained clown.

21:20.012 --> 21:23.149
And, uh, he's head
of all the rodeo clowns.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.918
Well, this must be
a dream come true for you.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.021
:
That is dretch... dratch...

21:29.055 --> 21:30.523
cha...

21:33.826 --> 21:35.795
Anyway, like I was saying,

21:35.828 --> 21:40.299
we've been all working very hard
to get open for the public.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.301

upbeat melody)
