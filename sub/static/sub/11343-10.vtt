00:00.784 --> 00:03.037
'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.078 --> 00:06.541
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.583 --> 00:10.838
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.880 --> 00:14.467
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.508 --> 00:16.803
'These are their stories.'

00:17.888 --> 00:22.310
Andrew? Andrew? Are you home?

00:22.351 --> 00:26.607
- Or are you out whoring?
- Mommy, please.

00:34.866 --> 00:39.455
Daddy? Oh, God! No!

00:39.496 --> 00:43.460
Daddy! Mom!

00:45.462 --> 00:49.633
Was anyone with you besides Emily
when you discovered your husband?

00:49.675 --> 00:53.471
No. I'd taken my son
down to his loft in Tribeca.

00:53.512 --> 00:58.059
He was out at the Hamptons
for a party. He hitched home with us.

00:58.101 --> 01:01.147
You were with your mom all weekend?

01:01.189 --> 01:06.153
Yeah. Not that I wanted to be.
She's such a bitch.

01:07.821 --> 01:12.785
- Daddy wanted a divorce but she didn't.
- How come?

01:12.827 --> 01:15.788
She wanted to be Mrs Andrew Harlin.

01:15.830 --> 01:20.044
Do you know anyone
who'd want to hurt your husband?

01:20.085 --> 01:22.255
Define hurt.

01:22.297 --> 01:25.967
Sorry. Yeah. Take your pick.

01:29.013 --> 01:32.892
Good old days. Let's see.

01:33.935 --> 01:36.563
No, not him.

01:38.398 --> 01:40.318
This one I recognise.

01:40.359 --> 01:44.781
He used to deliver pizza to us.
Until then he just delivered.

01:44.823 --> 01:47.576
Your husband was gay?

01:47.618 --> 01:53.249
What's more than bisexual?
How's compulsively orgasmic?

01:53.291 --> 01:56.378
Let's say he was polymorphously perverse,

01:56.420 --> 02:00.758
which is to say
that he would have sex with a plant.

02:00.799 --> 02:04.596
Is there a reason why the killer
sodomised him with a banana?

02:06.598 --> 02:08.684
He was allergic to bananas.

02:08.726 --> 02:13.815
He used to get all... covered in hives.

02:15.567 --> 02:17.777
I've got to call my son Adam.

03:08.546 --> 03:13.718
They didn't have to shove a banana
where the sun don't shine. That's just rude.

03:13.760 --> 03:16.597
Why did she stay if she knew?

03:16.638 --> 03:19.809
I know this guy. Maybe from school?

03:19.851 --> 03:22.520
It was disrespectful, not homicidal.

03:22.562 --> 03:27.109
It was symbolic.
Whoever inserted the banana...

03:27.151 --> 03:31.156
...knew he was allergic.
- They might not have meant to kill him.

03:31.198 --> 03:33.283
Dead men can't be allergic.

03:33.325 --> 03:38.456
Was it premeditated or a sex game
gone wrong? Are we sure the wife is clean?

03:38.497 --> 03:41.834
She has an alibi. Emily wouldn't lie.

03:41.876 --> 03:46.673
I'm positive I hung out with him.
We were friends or something.

03:46.715 --> 03:51.346
This may explain the widow's good mood.
I spoke to Harlin's lawyer.

03:51.387 --> 03:55.976
She and the kids split his assets,
which stand north of $100,000,000.

03:56.018 --> 03:58.312
She could've been nervous

03:58.353 --> 04:02.734
about someone being added to the list,
but I didn't get that vibe.

04:02.776 --> 04:05.905
- She didn't hide anything.
- No crocodile tears.

04:05.946 --> 04:08.949
Let's see what
all the pretty boys and girls say.

04:08.991 --> 04:12.495
You pull all of his records, bills, anything.

04:12.537 --> 04:15.875
You see what the son
knows about his dad's dates.

04:15.917 --> 04:18.961
Let's reconstruct this family's affairs.

04:22.674 --> 04:24.551
Did we go to school together?

04:24.593 --> 04:29.307
- You from Ypsilanti?
- No, but I swear to God I know him.

04:29.349 --> 04:34.021
No. I'd remember. Maybe you know me
from my banana commercial.

04:34.063 --> 04:36.440
- Yes.
- What's your real name?

04:36.482 --> 04:40.320
- Bull Dozer is my real stage name.
- Ah. The nom d'amour.

04:40.361 --> 04:44.325
Don't I look the part? I'm gonna make it.

04:44.366 --> 04:49.414
- Are you in porn?
- No, not yet. But soon. Very soon.

04:49.456 --> 04:54.210
I do the cheesy commercials for
the money but I was born to be in porn.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.173
I'm still looking for a porn talent agent.

04:57.214 --> 05:00.927
If you know of anyone,
maybe someone that you picked up.

05:00.969 --> 05:06.559
Hey, Mr Dozer! You said you'd ended
your relationship with Andrew. Why?

05:06.601 --> 05:09.353
Cos he didn't pay for the last seven dinners.

05:09.395 --> 05:12.524
He gave me nothing
and only wanted to have sex.

05:12.566 --> 05:15.569
We were both a top. It didn't really work out.

05:15.611 --> 05:18.323
He gave you some presents, didn't he?

05:18.364 --> 05:23.245
He lent me these to practise on.
Will the wife want them back?

05:23.287 --> 05:26.373
Kinda doubt she'll notice they're missing.

05:29.961 --> 05:32.213
Did you call your mother?

05:32.255 --> 05:37.011
We spent three hours in the car.
That's enough for three years.

05:37.053 --> 05:40.057
Traffic sucks on Sunday.
I was late for a gig.

05:40.098 --> 05:44.227
- Were you and your father close?
- Yeah. Very close.

05:44.269 --> 05:49.525
Till he started doing my girlfriends.
Then our relationship got sour.

05:49.567 --> 05:54.740
- Let's talk about your joint girlfriends.
- If he touched them, I dumped them.

05:54.781 --> 05:57.577
- Anybody recently?
- Becky.

05:57.619 --> 06:04.043
- Becky have a last name?
- Sorenson. She's a painter. Lives in NoHo.

06:04.084 --> 06:08.632
Adam's just young. He thinks small.

06:08.673 --> 06:13.178
- And Daddy?
- Nothing small about Daddy.

06:13.219 --> 06:16.432
Andrew was... something else.

06:16.474 --> 06:19.895
- Kinky?
- Enthusiastic.

06:20.437 --> 06:24.692
He did things to your body
that aren't even in the Kamasutra.

06:24.734 --> 06:26.569
Wow. So what happened?

06:26.611 --> 06:29.697
Nothing. We just moved on.

06:29.739 --> 06:34.578
Andrew had a very short
but intense attention span.

06:34.620 --> 06:36.789
- How short?
- Two weeks.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.166
Any hard feelings?

06:38.208 --> 06:41.629
- You're thinking about this the wrong way.
- How so?

06:41.670 --> 06:45.049
Andrew wasn't into monogamy.
Not even serial monogamy.

06:45.090 --> 06:47.302
Do you know any of these men?

06:49.512 --> 06:50.972
No.

06:53.267 --> 06:55.353
God, that's Charlie Poe.

06:55.394 --> 06:57.813
We chartered a boat a bunch of times.

06:59.066 --> 07:00.942
Andrew and Charlie?

07:02.694 --> 07:04.739
He chartered the boat a few times.

07:04.781 --> 07:08.284
Look, we know you two
had a sexual relationship.

07:08.326 --> 07:12.498
- See this? That's my family. I'm straight.
- Really?

07:12.539 --> 07:16.169
I'm not attracted
to the male gender in any way.

07:16.211 --> 07:19.839
See that?
You and Andrew make a great couple.

07:19.881 --> 07:24.053
We have others
where you're wearing your birthday suit.

07:24.094 --> 07:26.681
L-l never did anything. It wasn't me.

07:29.184 --> 07:32.980
- If you tell my wife...
- We won't unless it's necessary.

07:33.022 --> 07:36.525
You know what it costs
to send a kid to school today?

07:36.567 --> 07:40.906
Yeah, so, Andrew liked to sleep with me
a few times. But that's it.

07:40.947 --> 07:42.616
I never did anything. He did.

07:42.657 --> 07:46.454
In exchange he helped me out
with my kid's education.

07:47.914 --> 07:51.668
How often did you two fellas
tie each other up?

07:55.340 --> 07:57.842
- You mean bondage?
- Yeah, bondage.

07:58.968 --> 08:02.056
- Sometimes.
- Did he ever have you tie him up?

08:02.097 --> 08:08.104
No. He liked to keep me still.
You see, I'm very ticklish.

08:08.146 --> 08:11.984
It's not tension.
I'm ticklish even when I'm relaxed.

08:12.026 --> 08:14.361
I moved around and he didn't want...

08:14.403 --> 08:17.783
OK, terrific.
Do you know any of the other guys?

08:17.824 --> 08:22.580
What other guys? What are you
talking about? I was the only one.

08:22.622 --> 08:27.793
No, no. This was a first time
for both of us. That's why...

08:30.339 --> 08:32.174
Nobody fits.

08:32.215 --> 08:34.677
- All their records are clean?
- Yep.

08:34.719 --> 08:38.556
No motives. No angry break-ups.
Not even the pizza guy.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.976
For a 50-year-old, he had a lot of energy.

08:41.018 --> 08:44.814
- What are you implying?
- Nothing. I'm sure you have as much.

08:44.856 --> 08:50.696
Check this out. Mr Kink Galore
spent more dough on girls than boys.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.158
A lot of lingerie. 40 grand alone last year.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.913
It could have been for the boys.
It's hard to tell. He was horny.

08:57.954 --> 09:00.165
A fingerprint was found in the study.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.502
Belongs to a Sonya Pietrovicz.
Russian woman.

09:03.544 --> 09:08.967
She's off the boat three years ago.
Occupation is gulyashchaya dyevka.

09:09.009 --> 09:13.473
Every sailor knows
that's Russian for hooker.

09:17.644 --> 09:20.522
I understand if you don't want to strip.

09:20.564 --> 09:23.525
But you must take off your shoes.

09:27.155 --> 09:29.617
Sonya's been gone a few weeks.

09:29.658 --> 09:35.624
She met Victor. She's says she's in love.
He's rich. He owns Ecstasy.

09:35.665 --> 09:38.585
- Ecstasy?
- The hottest spa in Manhattan.

09:38.627 --> 09:43.216
There's a three-month wait for a facial.
He'll make millions. Bastard.

09:43.257 --> 09:48.972
I gave her a good job, masseuse,
and she left me for that pig Victor.

09:49.014 --> 09:52.185
- I thought she was different.
- Different how?

09:52.226 --> 09:56.939
She'll never find love.
She treats men like she's a whore.

09:56.981 --> 09:58.025
Is she?

09:58.067 --> 10:02.321
A whore in America's just a hooker.
In Russia it's different.

10:02.362 --> 10:06.242
Whores are at the top of the social scene.
Everyone respects them.

10:06.284 --> 10:10.372
They rarely fall in love.
When they do, you want to be there.

10:10.414 --> 10:17.047
I've been in America a long time.
American girls fall in love so easily.

10:17.088 --> 10:22.136
I don't give a damn where she is now.

10:22.178 --> 10:25.641
- His shoes?
- He's allowed.

10:33.399 --> 10:36.402
- I know him from somewhere.
- Carnegie Hall.

10:36.444 --> 10:40.866
- He's a famous violinist from Moscow.
- No, the guy in the water.

10:40.908 --> 10:45.121
A good friend. A respectable businessman.

10:50.461 --> 10:53.673
Facial or waxing? Is this your first visit?

10:53.715 --> 10:58.887
Detectives Benson and Stabler.
We need to speak to Sonya Pietrovicz.

10:58.929 --> 11:02.308
She doesn't work here any more
but go to room six.

11:02.350 --> 11:07.648
Natasha's there. They were friends.
You'll have to go alone.

11:11.527 --> 11:15.865
- I'm sorry, I'm with a client.
- Natasha? May I speak to you?

11:15.907 --> 11:19.536
Sure. I'll be right back.

11:21.706 --> 11:25.043
So Sonya was a friend of yours?

11:25.084 --> 11:27.713
- Why? Is she in trouble?
- Maybe.

11:27.755 --> 11:31.008
Her Mafia boyfriend
already screwed her over?

11:31.050 --> 11:34.346
- He would be?
- Yuri. He got her the singing job.

11:34.387 --> 11:38.183
I thought she and I were friends.
We lived together for a while.

11:38.224 --> 11:42.188
- We went to Brighton Beach.
- Didn't she date the owner here?

11:42.229 --> 11:44.691
Victor? Everybody dates him.

11:44.733 --> 11:47.486
That's how you get a job.

11:47.527 --> 11:52.283
Do you know if she had
an American boyfriend, Andrew Harlin?

11:52.325 --> 11:57.206
Maybe. She met a lot of men.
That's why we're not friends now.

11:57.247 --> 12:00.584
We both auditioned for a nightclub.

12:00.626 --> 12:05.548
We both sang. It's simple.
I have talent, she doesn't.

12:05.590 --> 12:09.303
But she got the job
because she did it with Yuri.

12:09.345 --> 12:11.889
He's connected. So he got her the job.

12:36.502 --> 12:38.253
- Sonya Pietrovicz?
- Da.

12:38.295 --> 12:40.173
Got a minute?

12:41.633 --> 12:46.722
We're Detectives Benson and Stabler.
We need to ask a few questions.

12:46.764 --> 12:50.351
- About what?
- How do you know Andrew Harlin?

12:50.392 --> 12:54.064
- I don't know Andrew.
- Let me refresh your memory.

12:54.105 --> 12:57.860
He was found strangled to death
in a black leather harness.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.738
Your fingerprint was next to the body.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.701
I just cleaned his house.
He was so friendly, so alive.

13:04.743 --> 13:09.081
His housekeeper needed someone
to take her job, needed favour.

13:09.123 --> 13:12.418
- And he needed...
- A favour. You do a lot of favours.

13:12.460 --> 13:16.048
- We try to help each other.
- What's the housekeeper's name?

13:16.089 --> 13:18.258
- Katya. She's away.
- Where?

13:18.300 --> 13:21.262
- On vacation.
- Where on vacation?

13:21.304 --> 13:23.890
I don't know. She took her passport.

13:23.932 --> 13:27.311
- How long have you worked here?
- I just started.

13:27.353 --> 13:31.399
- So you're a singing housekeeper?
- You do what you have to do.

13:31.441 --> 13:33.526
Did you clean on Sunday night?

13:33.568 --> 13:37.531
I was here at night.
I clean up Sunday afternoon.

13:37.573 --> 13:40.993
A big star like you
cleaning people's houses?

13:41.035 --> 13:43.789
- I exaggerate sometimes.
- OK.

13:45.832 --> 13:50.505
Let's start over again.
Katya, the housekeeper...

13:50.546 --> 13:52.381
- Katya.
- Yeah.

13:52.423 --> 13:56.970
- Did she sleep with Andrew Harlin?
- I can't remember.

13:57.012 --> 14:01.142
- Please turn around.
- Just once, I think. I don't know.

14:01.184 --> 14:05.105
We want to talk to Katya.
You have her get in touch with us.

14:05.147 --> 14:08.400
Or find out where she is.

14:08.442 --> 14:10.320
By tomorrow.

14:12.322 --> 14:14.449
I wonder what else she polished.

14:14.491 --> 14:18.120
Sleeping with guys is the only way
she knows to get on top.

14:18.162 --> 14:22.876
- All Russian girls are whores?
- Remember what they've been through.

14:22.918 --> 14:28.132
Poverty, corruption, drunken abuse.
They learn that they have to lie.

14:28.174 --> 14:31.511
Their bodies are their only assets.
Sex is money.

14:31.552 --> 14:35.182
So by doing the right guys, they end up rich.

14:35.224 --> 14:37.559
I know this is anthropologic,

14:37.601 --> 14:41.230
but Russia's response
to the Monica-Clinton scandal

14:41.272 --> 14:44.109
was, 'We wish we had a virile president.'

14:44.151 --> 14:47.988
They know there's
commerce involved in the art of love.

14:48.030 --> 14:52.535
That was the housekeeper.
She's not on vacation.

14:52.577 --> 14:57.958
She's not Russian. She never works
weekends and her name isn't Katya.

14:58.959 --> 15:04.090
- A man died, Sonya.
- And I know nothing about it.

15:04.132 --> 15:07.803
- Why lie about Katya?
- Sometimes friends are all you have.

15:07.845 --> 15:14.144
- Why should we believe you?
- Do or do not. It's your choice.

15:14.186 --> 15:17.690
Even if I could tell you,
you might not understand.

15:17.732 --> 15:20.943
- What do you mean?
- I see how you look at me.

15:20.985 --> 15:24.782
I know you look down
on what I do for a living.

15:24.823 --> 15:29.913
But there are things about what I do
that are not so easy to read.

15:29.954 --> 15:32.707
Like what?

15:32.749 --> 15:36.921
It is exciting to do something forbidden.

15:36.962 --> 15:42.928
My job is forbidden in this country,
a country that is all about freedoms.

15:42.969 --> 15:45.097
But more than that.

15:45.139 --> 15:49.060
I am with men who are
breaking promises to their wives.

15:49.101 --> 15:52.314
That excites them,
makes them come alive again.

15:52.356 --> 15:54.983
I make them come alive again.

15:55.025 --> 15:59.155
I am their freedom. And that is delicious.

16:02.284 --> 16:07.916
In America you are what you do.
I am thanktul not to work in a spa,

16:07.957 --> 16:10.210
thanktul not to work in a salon.

16:11.336 --> 16:15.633
And yet, and of this
I am most thanktul for of all,

16:15.674 --> 16:18.219
my only commitment is to my friends.

16:18.260 --> 16:21.514
You mean, to Katya.

16:21.556 --> 16:24.518
- Why are you so uneasy?
- It is a small community.

16:24.560 --> 16:28.314
People will know I've talked to you
and they won't like it.

16:28.356 --> 16:32.110
- Where's Katya live?
- With her boyfriend.

16:32.152 --> 16:35.782
- Where do you live?
- With my aunt. It affords me...

16:35.823 --> 16:37.575
- Freedom?
- Exactly.

16:37.617 --> 16:40.578
- Who's Katya dating now?
- I don't know.

16:40.620 --> 16:43.499
I honestly don't know.

16:45.042 --> 16:47.337
Elliot. Emily Harlin to see you.

16:54.011 --> 16:59.726
Daddy told me he loved being in love
so much that he fell in love too easily.

16:59.768 --> 17:05.775
All that stuff he did, it was his cry for help,
but Mom could never reach out to him.

17:05.816 --> 17:08.694
- Did she know about his affairs?
- Yeah.

17:08.736 --> 17:11.990
She didn't mind as long
as it was only with guys,

17:12.031 --> 17:15.994
but once he fell in love with Katya,
they fought all the time.

17:16.037 --> 17:18.873
- Katya?
- Katya Ivanova. She's Russian.

17:18.915 --> 17:22.752
- He said she's beautiful.
- Did your mom know about her?

17:22.795 --> 17:27.967
Absolutely.
She called her his Russian whore.

17:28.009 --> 17:33.641
Daddy said that if anything happened to him,
his personal stuff was in a secret drawer.

17:33.682 --> 17:35.768
He showed me the keys.

17:35.809 --> 17:42.442
So after he died, I waited till Mom was out,
and got all of his stuff.

17:43.903 --> 17:47.782
There wasn't much there
but I did find one thing.

17:47.823 --> 17:52.996
- What's that?
- It's some kind of legal mumbo jumbo.

17:53.038 --> 17:57.418
It looks like Daddy
was suing Katya for a lot of money.

17:58.252 --> 18:00.589
And I was wondering if...

18:00.631 --> 18:03.967
You thought maybe that's why he died?

18:04.009 --> 18:07.138
How much was he suing Katya for?

18:07.180 --> 18:13.354
He's suing her for $2,000,000?
That's what I call a motive.

18:13.395 --> 18:16.942
That's the value of the gifts she kept.

18:16.983 --> 18:20.654
Andrew and Katya had a five-month affair.

18:20.695 --> 18:25.034
He left her when she cheated on him
in the apartment he paid for.

18:25.076 --> 18:27.621
He wasn't as understanding as his wife.

18:27.662 --> 18:32.834
The morning after Andrew's killed,
the lawsuit's dropped by his wife.

18:32.876 --> 18:35.463
After he was dead.

18:35.505 --> 18:38.759
- Yeah.
- Sounds like they worked together.

18:38.801 --> 18:43.180
Katya is now our prime suspect.
Do we know where she is?

18:43.222 --> 18:46.142
Emily thought her mother might know.

18:46.184 --> 18:49.729
She heard them arguing
about Katya's apartment.

18:49.772 --> 18:53.943
- Give my regards to the widow.
- Yep.

18:56.738 --> 19:01.827
I always wanted more red in the library
but Andrew never liked it.

19:01.869 --> 19:07.042
Why didn't you tell us that Andrew had
a girlfriend he spent two million dollars on?

19:07.084 --> 19:10.378
Katya? I assumed
you knew about the lawsuit.

19:10.420 --> 19:14.842
Still, two million dollars.
And you decided to drop it?

19:14.884 --> 19:17.762
Adam, would you
get our guests some drinks?

19:17.805 --> 19:20.015
No, thank you. We're fine.

19:20.057 --> 19:23.853
You told us about the others.
You left her out. Why?

19:23.895 --> 19:28.733
- Are you so sure she didn't do it?
- I didn't really think about it.

19:28.775 --> 19:33.697
- We think you're covering for her.
- Me covering for that little bitch?

19:33.739 --> 19:37.202
I was probably
trying to cover my humiliation.

19:37.243 --> 19:41.332
How would you feel if your husband
fell for a Russian whore?

19:41.374 --> 19:43.292
Maybe she did you a favour.

19:43.334 --> 19:47.547
They are everywhere.
They're sucking the men dry.

19:47.589 --> 19:52.595
Not only of their money but of their sanity.
They ruin everybody's marriage.

19:52.637 --> 19:57.559
You never heard of the Ultra-Natashas?
They all ought to be called Katya.

19:57.601 --> 20:02.231
Did you know that Katya
is Russian slang for $100?

20:02.272 --> 20:08.071
What? I'm meant to become
a pathetic divorcee who has to say,

20:08.112 --> 20:10.074
'How old is your Russian?'

20:10.115 --> 20:13.243
Was there also a Sonya?

20:13.285 --> 20:16.748
I didn't know about Sonya.
But I bet there was.

20:16.790 --> 20:21.587
I bet there was a Sonya and a Natasha
and a Nina and an Irina.

20:21.629 --> 20:26.301
They're all little whores.
Little Russian sluts. Sorry, dear.

20:26.343 --> 20:31.015
- Where were you yesterday afternoon?
- She drove me to a poetry convention.

20:31.057 --> 20:36.062
I told her she should drop the lawsuit.
I didn't think she should keep it going.

20:36.103 --> 20:38.190
Your husband paid for everything?

20:38.232 --> 20:41.945
- She couldn't afford toilet paper.
- Or an apartment?

20:41.986 --> 20:46.783
A $10,000-a-month apartment.
Two bedrooms. $10,000 a month.

20:46.824 --> 20:50.621
- Do you have an address?
- I don't. Check with my lawyer.

20:54.292 --> 20:57.128
Yeah? Whoa, whoa! Uh-huh?

20:57.170 --> 21:03.636
OK. Listen, I can't understand
a word you're saying. Hold on.

21:07.891 --> 21:11.479
John? There's a very upset Russian woman
on line two.

21:11.521 --> 21:14.649
I can't understand her.
You speak some Russian?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.777
What? Stolichnaya?

21:26.245 --> 21:30.751
Da. Da. That was Sonya Pietrovicz,
the nightclub singer.

21:30.793 --> 21:35.131
She's very scared and upset.
She's on Brighton Beach. Come on.

22:06.919 --> 22:09.713
- It's Sonya.
- Who's the other woman?

22:09.755 --> 22:14.344
I dunno, but I'd better tell Babushka
to stop washing the stairs.

22:24.231 --> 22:25.857
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:25.899 --> 22:28.861
Nothing like making love with a hatchet.

22:28.903 --> 22:30.905
Definitely not sex related.

22:30.947 --> 22:34.451
This is the girl's cousin.
He doesn't speak English.

22:44.587 --> 22:48.383
He has a restaurant nearby.
He wants us to go there.

22:48.425 --> 22:51.471
To drink or talk. I'm not sure.

22:54.808 --> 22:57.311
He says he's devastated about this.

22:57.353 --> 23:00.564
The older woman
was Sonya's aunt and his cousin.

23:00.606 --> 23:04.402
Ask him if Sonya had any girlfriends.

23:09.325 --> 23:12.036
She had a few. He has a picture.

23:13.997 --> 23:18.126
Like her they all look like models
and talented like her.

23:18.168 --> 23:21.714
That's her friend Katya. Not bad.

23:21.756 --> 23:23.383
Has he seen this man?

23:29.223 --> 23:32.268
They don't bring
their American boyfriends here.

23:32.310 --> 23:36.023
There's a plus side.
He's offering you some borscht.

23:37.650 --> 23:41.321
One strangled, two axed.
Why Sonya? Why the aunt?

23:41.363 --> 23:43.782
- Sonya called?
- Sounded nervous?

23:43.823 --> 23:46.534
Nervous enough for us to go there.

23:46.576 --> 23:49.413
Katya doesn't look like an axe-swinger.

23:49.455 --> 23:51.999
We have her address. We're going now.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.795
Can I help you?

23:54.836 --> 23:58.549
- Benson and Stabler?
- Yes. Where'd you get that?

23:58.591 --> 24:02.595
You've asked questions.
I have information for you.

24:02.637 --> 24:07.643
This has been most difficult.
I'd like to be calm but...

24:07.684 --> 24:12.273
My father, he was not perfect.
He drank and he smoked.

24:12.315 --> 24:16.862
He slept with other women
in front of my mother in the same room.

24:16.904 --> 24:22.285
He had his faults but he was a good man.
A good man. Great heart.

24:22.327 --> 24:25.998
My mother followed him to Siberia.
Her life was his.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.291
That's touching.

24:27.333 --> 24:32.130
That's devotion! That's love.
Do you understand what real love is?

24:32.172 --> 24:33.965
Yes. I think we do.

24:34.007 --> 24:38.763
You're sniffing around.
You want to blame Katya. I won't let you.

24:38.805 --> 24:44.895
- We haven't even found Katya yet.
- You don't need to. I killed him.

24:44.937 --> 24:47.940
- Who?
- Andrew Harlin. I killed him.

24:47.981 --> 24:52.403
- I couldn't let him treat Katya like that.
- Who are you again?

24:52.445 --> 24:56.075
I am Alexander Strizhov.
I brought Katya to America.

24:56.116 --> 24:59.663
I arrange everything for her. I...

25:01.164 --> 25:05.503
She's like family to me.
I love her so much.

25:05.544 --> 25:10.508
I'm devoted to her.
And when that bastard sued her!

25:10.549 --> 25:15.180
And I saw her pain. I...

25:15.222 --> 25:18.893
- I had to end it.
- Do you know what you're saying?

25:18.935 --> 25:22.981
- We must advise you of your rights.
- No smoking here.

25:26.401 --> 25:29.072
Don't worry. I know what I'm saying.

25:29.113 --> 25:32.533
No one will blame me for what I did.
It was just.

25:32.575 --> 25:35.579
I shot him like a dog. He deserved it.

25:35.621 --> 25:37.498
He wasn't shot.

25:37.539 --> 25:40.835
Shot, not shot! That's not the point. I did it.

25:40.877 --> 25:44.047
- I killed him like a dog.
- How'd you kill him?

25:44.089 --> 25:48.344
That's not important!
What's important is I did it.

25:48.386 --> 25:51.431
- Do you know Sonya?
- The stewardess?

25:51.473 --> 25:53.016
No, the singer.

25:53.058 --> 25:59.565
Oh, that Sonya. Yes, of course
I know Sonya. Everyone knows Sonya.

25:59.607 --> 26:04.780
Great talent, beautiful voice,
but I don't really know her.

26:04.821 --> 26:08.034
Did you know that
she and her aunt had been killed?

26:08.076 --> 26:15.167
No! No! How tragic.
Who would hurt Sonya or her aunt?

26:15.209 --> 26:19.923
That's what we want to know.
You want to confess to that too?

26:19.964 --> 26:23.343
I didn't kill Sonya! But I killed Harlin.

26:23.385 --> 26:28.724
Please arrest me. I'm ready to pay.
Please! Arrest me. Arrest me!

26:28.766 --> 26:31.019
Please! Arrest me!

26:31.061 --> 26:33.730
Let me guess. He's lying.

26:33.772 --> 26:37.360
- He said he shot Harlin.
- But Harlin was strangled.

26:37.401 --> 26:40.154
Why confess to a crime he didn't commit?

26:40.196 --> 26:42.991
- He talked about love, devotion.
- To Katya.

26:43.033 --> 26:46.079
Who did not return his affections.

26:46.120 --> 26:51.209
Maybe he's under her spell and thinks
this confession is laying a red cape for her.

26:51.250 --> 26:54.338
Did Prince Charming
think we'd believe him?

26:54.380 --> 26:58.134
Does he think we'll turn our attention
from Katya to him?

26:58.176 --> 27:01.888
It sounds like
that's exactly what he's hoping.

27:01.930 --> 27:05.601
Hope. Sometimes that's all love is.

27:05.643 --> 27:10.106
Well, he's wrong. Let's go find this Katya.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.574
Katya? She's beautiful.

27:18.616 --> 27:20.535
Such a nice, honest girl.

27:20.577 --> 27:24.164
Always gives me a big tip,
even when I just say hello.

27:24.206 --> 27:27.168
Ever see this gentleman
enter her apartment?

27:27.210 --> 27:30.254
All the time.
Haven't seen him in a few weeks.

27:30.296 --> 27:34.676
- Too bad. He gave very big tips.
- Is she home?

27:34.718 --> 27:38.765
She left an hour ago,
dressed in a beautiful gown.

27:38.807 --> 27:41.810
- She say where she was going?
- I don't ask.

27:41.851 --> 27:43.854
Which way did the taxi go?

27:43.896 --> 27:47.734
Never takes a taxi.
She took her car service.

27:47.776 --> 27:51.321
It's the easiest number in the book.
555-0100.

28:00.457 --> 28:02.542
There she is. That's her.

28:06.089 --> 28:08.174
Katya Ivanova?

28:12.137 --> 28:16.518
- You knew Andrew Harlin intimately?
- Are you attracted to me?

28:16.559 --> 28:20.230
- Miss Ivanova.
- Do you want to make love to me?

28:20.271 --> 28:23.651
Why don't you start
answering my questions?

28:23.692 --> 28:28.990
- Only if you answer mine first.
- What's that gonna cost me?

28:29.032 --> 28:33.496
Oh, I am too expensive
for your detective's salary.

28:33.537 --> 28:35.248
And I don't take money.

28:35.289 --> 28:39.836
- No. You just take husbands.
- His wife sent you?

28:39.878 --> 28:41.380
- Who?
- Who?

28:41.421 --> 28:43.925
Who is playing games now?

28:43.966 --> 28:46.803
You mean Andrew's wife, Christina?

28:46.844 --> 28:50.808
I thought she wanted
to open the case again.

28:50.849 --> 28:53.727
Huh. You know your friend Sonya's dead?

28:55.980 --> 28:57.857
I know.

28:59.776 --> 29:03.322
I am very sad.
She was a very good friend.

29:03.364 --> 29:06.535
But I have to go on with my life.

29:06.576 --> 29:10.622
I don't know who would want to kill her.
She was very innocent.

29:10.664 --> 29:12.792
Innocent of what?

29:12.833 --> 29:16.754
Why don't we continue
this conversation at the unit?

29:16.796 --> 29:19.257
- Now?
- Now would be good.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.301
- Am I under arrest?
- Not yet.

29:21.343 --> 29:26.057
Oh. Then I think I say no.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.142
I'm all dressed up.

29:28.184 --> 29:31.855
Come down to the station
tomorrow morning for questioning.

29:31.897 --> 29:36.027
It'll take a while.
Wear something more comfortable.

29:36.069 --> 29:38.947
- I'm too busy.
- We know you're illegal.

29:38.988 --> 29:45.497
We're not Vice. We don't care what
you make or what gifts you receive.

29:45.538 --> 29:47.624
But if you're not at our office by 9am.

29:47.666 --> 29:51.295
Immigration'll be with you by 9:05,
that I guarantee you.

29:51.337 --> 29:53.506
This is America. You can't do this.

29:53.547 --> 29:57.219
I'll tell you a secret.
Cops are the same everywhere.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.930
OK, but could we make it noon?

29:59.971 --> 30:06.687
I'm not a morning person.
I may not be home by 9:00.

30:10.776 --> 30:16.991
You people are already working, hm?

30:17.033 --> 30:20.955
- You're used to this kind of hour?
- Yeah. No smoking.

30:20.996 --> 30:25.585
I'll come back later.
I can't talk without a cigarette.

30:28.004 --> 30:31.342
- All right?
- Are you married?

30:31.384 --> 30:33.678
Do you know Alexander Strissov?

30:33.719 --> 30:36.556
- Strizhov.
- Whatever.

30:36.598 --> 30:41.019
Yes. Very good man,
has a good heart. Very generous.

30:41.061 --> 30:46.025
Yeah. So it seems.
He confessed to Andrew Harlin's murder.

30:46.067 --> 30:51.198
It was him? Poor Alex. Such a bad temper.

30:51.240 --> 30:54.118
The problem is, poor Alex didn't kill him.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.954
Then why did he confess?

30:55.995 --> 30:59.208
That's something
we hoped you could tell us.

30:59.250 --> 31:03.755
Yours and Sonya's
fingerprints were found near the body.

31:03.797 --> 31:07.842
- I wore gloves.
- So now you're confessing?

31:07.884 --> 31:14.600
No. I didn't want to break my nails
on the metal rings on that stupid harness.

31:16.728 --> 31:20.315
Sonya and I went to Andrew's to tease him.

31:20.357 --> 31:23.653
No one gets away with
treating me like he did.

31:23.694 --> 31:27.908
- So you killed him.
- No. I didn't kill him.

31:27.950 --> 31:32.455
I let him tie me up so many times
just to please him and he sues me.

31:32.497 --> 31:35.416
He appreciated nothing that I did for him.

31:35.458 --> 31:39.630
Why did he sue you?
Wasn't it because you cheated on him?

31:39.672 --> 31:44.552
What? I found him
in bed with two men. That was it.

31:46.763 --> 31:50.559
Tell me something.
Why did you bring Sonya with you?

31:50.601 --> 31:54.063
Because sometimes we did threesome.

31:54.981 --> 31:56.233
You should try it.

31:56.274 --> 31:59.277
With Sonya it was fun.

31:59.319 --> 32:02.949
I don't mind.
I could trust her. We were friends.

32:02.990 --> 32:06.828
I'm not lesbian. Neither was Sonya.

32:07.996 --> 32:09.706
Sonya admired me.

32:09.748 --> 32:14.170
She was very... feminine.
But two men? Niet.

32:14.212 --> 32:17.633
So you weren't upset
when you found out he was dead?

32:17.675 --> 32:21.136
It's very strange about the death.

32:21.178 --> 32:26.226
But you have to understand,
I have to live my life, be secure, stable.

32:26.267 --> 32:30.272
I have to sleep with men like him.
It is an investment.

32:31.565 --> 32:35.445
Then I can fall in love
without a business interest.

32:35.487 --> 32:40.034
Can you tell me where you went
after you were teasing Andrew?

32:40.076 --> 32:44.288
I went to hear Sonya sing
and meet a friend.

32:44.330 --> 32:50.588
One thing. Did you put the banana
in Andrew's rear end?

32:52.006 --> 32:56.804
Yes. He was allergic to bananas.

32:56.845 --> 33:00.599
But if that killed him,
it was an honest mistake.

33:02.268 --> 33:07.441
Cabarets. Spas. Salons. Rich boyfriends.
Hookers. What are we talking about?

33:07.483 --> 33:10.694
- Maybe the Russian Mafia killed him.
- And Sonya.

33:10.736 --> 33:14.366
Or had them killed.
We haven't checked the Russian Mafia.

33:14.407 --> 33:19.121
I don't understand. Everyone
we've talked to has described Katya

33:19.163 --> 33:23.292
- as a modern-day Cleopatra.
- Not a Siberian Tammy Faye Bakker.

33:23.334 --> 33:26.171
Harlin could have had anyone. Why Katya?

33:26.213 --> 33:29.550
Because it was dangerous.
He liked extremes.

33:29.592 --> 33:32.011
Girlfriends, boyfriends, bananas.

33:32.053 --> 33:37.559
Sleeping with the girlfriend of a mobster
may have had a certain je ne sais quoi.

33:37.601 --> 33:39.853
- Je ne sais quoi?
- N'est-ce pas?

33:39.895 --> 33:42.482
One language at a time, merci?

33:42.524 --> 33:47.488
Go back to Sonya's boyfriend's joint.
See what he's fronting.

33:49.990 --> 33:52.077
Do you know Sonya Pietrovicz?

33:52.118 --> 33:54.704
Poor Sonya. What do you want to drink?

33:54.746 --> 33:57.082
Her boyfriend here?

33:57.123 --> 33:59.710
Excuse me. Would you like to join us?

34:01.963 --> 34:03.840
Of course.

34:09.013 --> 34:11.599
I would like to ask your lady to dance.

34:11.641 --> 34:15.688
- Thank you, but I don't dance.
- Then you'll have to wait here.

34:21.110 --> 34:26.784
Sweet Sonya. Such youth. Such ambition.
A waste of great talent.

34:26.826 --> 34:29.245
You knew I wanted to talk about her?

34:29.286 --> 34:34.918
My wife liked Sonya very much.
She always liked to listen to her sing.

34:34.960 --> 34:39.090
My wife used to sing,
so Sonya reminded her of herself.

34:39.130 --> 34:43.679
But now she's very upset that Sonya's dead.
Unnecessary dead.

34:43.719 --> 34:45.347
Where's this going?

34:45.389 --> 34:49.976
Life is a matter of making choices.
Good choices and bad choices.

34:50.018 --> 34:55.442
They teach this in America.
We Russians try to learn it from you.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.236
That's very flattering.

34:57.277 --> 34:59.864
- She was always with wrong men.
- Such as?

34:59.906 --> 35:03.993
Here. Alexander Strizhov.

35:04.035 --> 35:09.208
We gave him chance.
We had high hopes for him. But now...

35:09.250 --> 35:12.003
- You've had enough.
- What do you think?

35:12.045 --> 35:15.173
- What kind of choice is Alex?
- Alex?

35:15.215 --> 35:19.178
You are 100 per cent right.
He was unnecessary bad choice.

35:19.220 --> 35:21.932
- Alex is the bad guy?
- We are not bad men.

35:21.974 --> 35:24.142
We are mix of good and evil.

35:24.184 --> 35:26.687
- I said he was wrong.
- You got proof?

35:26.728 --> 35:31.526
- What do you need?
- To prove that he killed her or Harlin?

35:31.567 --> 35:35.739
I do not suggest that.
We're having a friendly conversation.

35:35.781 --> 35:39.536
I work for airline business. You are police.

35:39.577 --> 35:45.125
And we are new in this country
with new ways. That's all I know.

35:49.255 --> 35:51.716
- Call me.
- Thanks for your help.

35:51.758 --> 35:52.926
Vodka?

35:52.968 --> 35:57.390
Hello, my friend.
You're still looking?

35:57.431 --> 36:02.354
- Now you speak English?
- You're starting to piss me off.

36:02.396 --> 36:06.776
- Because I'm drunk?
- Because you just spoke English.

36:06.818 --> 36:09.320
When I drink, I speak every language.

36:09.362 --> 36:14.743
- Why not tell us what you know?
- I know a lot. I hear yelling.

36:14.785 --> 36:19.624
Then I think, Sonya and Alex have sex.
Like always, he's spanking. I like.

36:19.666 --> 36:25.089
But then I hear screaming...
Poor Sonya.

36:25.130 --> 36:26.799
Alex Strizhov?

36:26.840 --> 36:30.762
Don't interrupt.
Yes, yes. I hear, 'You killed?'

36:30.804 --> 36:33.640
Then, crash, bang, he killed her.

36:33.682 --> 36:37.019
- Who, Alex?
- Don't interrupt! Yes, Alex.

36:37.061 --> 36:41.525
- He is a brilliant man!
- Are you mocking him?

36:41.566 --> 36:45.320
You losers. You more stupid than my ass.

36:45.362 --> 36:50.409
Yeah, Alex! Of course, Alex.
Poor Alex! Poor Sonya!

36:50.451 --> 36:52.496
They all suffer like me.

36:57.418 --> 37:00.630
We know he killed Sonya.

37:00.672 --> 37:04.426
- We think he killed Andrew.
- How do you know?

37:04.468 --> 37:07.846
We know. We just don't know why.

37:07.888 --> 37:10.058
I don't either.

37:10.100 --> 37:12.769
You knew Alex and Sonya slept together?

37:12.811 --> 37:17.900
So? Maybe she wasn't as good
as me in bed,

37:17.942 --> 37:21.988
- but that's no reason to kill her.
- Weren't you good friends?

37:22.030 --> 37:24.784
Yes. But she could sleep with who she liked.

37:24.826 --> 37:28.079
- Were you sleeping with Alex?
- Not any more.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.875
So what if we were?

37:33.710 --> 37:36.714
Ah, can I talk to her alone?

37:48.311 --> 37:50.897
You know how easy it would be
to convict you?

37:50.939 --> 37:53.442
No.

37:54.735 --> 37:57.738
You were at Andrew's. You tied him up.

37:57.780 --> 38:02.452
You and Sonya left fingerprints.
I know you're not an idiot.

38:02.494 --> 38:06.916
- A jury would find you guilty in a heartbeat.
- I am not guilty.

38:06.958 --> 38:09.962
- Help us catch Alex.
- I'm busy.

38:15.593 --> 38:18.930
So what?
You don't care if a murderer gets caught?

38:18.972 --> 38:22.810
You don't feel any fear or any guilt?

38:23.811 --> 38:30.443
Who are you? Some sex machine
with a cash register between her legs?

38:30.485 --> 38:33.280
Or are you too afraid to get involved?

38:33.322 --> 38:35.825
You got it.

38:35.866 --> 38:40.747
I've got a war out there
to make sure that I survive. Understand?

38:41.748 --> 38:45.044
Some lose. Some die and some win.

38:45.086 --> 38:47.964
No one helps anyone.

38:48.005 --> 38:52.177
Alex is upset because
I don't want to have sex with him any more.

38:52.219 --> 38:56.307
- I have more things to worry about.
- Like your nails?

38:57.725 --> 39:02.314
- You make a living sleeping with guys.
- You should sleep with men more.

39:02.356 --> 39:07.112
Trust me. It would help you.
You wouldn't be such a mean bitch.

39:08.196 --> 39:11.283
I make my living catching murderers.

39:11.951 --> 39:15.538
America's not so different
from Russia, you know?

39:15.579 --> 39:21.002
Especially the prisons.
There's no champagne. There's no caviar.

39:21.044 --> 39:24.340
I don't believe you.

39:24.382 --> 39:30.097
Fine. We'll do it your way.
You have the right to remain silent.

39:30.138 --> 39:32.724
- You are under arrest.
- OK! OK!

39:32.766 --> 39:36.145
I'll do it. Just once.

39:36.187 --> 39:41.735
I guess I'm in the mood
for horseradish vodka.

39:41.777 --> 39:43.195
What?

39:43.237 --> 39:49.702
At the restaurant Alex hangs out at,
my favourite vodka is horseradish.

40:04.178 --> 40:08.767
- What?
- Something. 'You betrayed me.'

40:08.809 --> 40:12.437
- Something about Pushkin.
- Do we move out or not?

40:12.479 --> 40:15.942
She says she's not in jail
because she's too busy.

40:15.984 --> 40:19.196
Like we're not. I can't believe these people.

40:19.238 --> 40:23.283
She's saying Alex killed Andrew
so he must really love her.

40:23.325 --> 40:27.080
He's saying he should get it over with. Now!

40:28.414 --> 40:31.001
Call for backup.

40:33.963 --> 40:36.550
- Put the gun down.
- Put the gun down.

40:36.591 --> 40:41.305
- Drop it.
- Don't worry. I won't shoot anyone.

40:51.525 --> 40:56.322
I will tell you a Russian love poem.
It could be long, it could be short.

40:56.364 --> 41:00.369
Depends, unless you want to shoot me now
and not hear anything.

41:00.411 --> 41:05.667
I brought Katya to America.
I loved her. I did everything to protect her.

41:05.708 --> 41:09.839
I wanted to marry her.
She left me. She had no gratitude.

41:09.880 --> 41:12.508
My mother was always grateful to my father.

41:14.511 --> 41:17.305
I went into Andrew's house

41:17.347 --> 41:19.891
after the girls left him tied up.

41:19.933 --> 41:22.311
I strangled him with a rope.

41:22.353 --> 41:26.191
I wanted Katya to pay,
to learn to start respecting me.

41:26.233 --> 41:29.403
I had to teach her a lesson.

41:30.946 --> 41:35.660
I told Sonya.
Some days you make stupid mistakes.

41:35.701 --> 41:40.416
I didn't want to kill her but I had to.
I know she called you.

41:40.457 --> 41:45.755
I could kill her because I didn't love her.
I sent the aunt to the store.

41:45.797 --> 41:50.845
But the store was closed and she came
back too soon. What could I do?

41:50.886 --> 41:54.724
Alex, put the gun down.

41:54.766 --> 41:59.020
I wanted to be happy.
I wanted to live with Katya in America.

41:59.062 --> 42:02.525
I wanted her to love me. But she hurt me.

42:04.652 --> 42:08.281
No one hurts me. Not even this gun.

42:09.574 --> 42:13.538
See how lucky I am?

42:32.518 --> 42:34.312
Let's go home, Olivia.

42:39.944 --> 42:45.117
Some people consider death a blessing.
This was no blessing.

42:45.158 --> 42:46.827
What a mess.

42:46.868 --> 42:52.458
Killing people because of
some vodka-induced notion of tragedy.

42:52.500 --> 42:57.589
That's a lot of crap.
And for this, they come to America.
