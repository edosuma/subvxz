00:51.786 --> 00:53.852
I'm a doctor. I believe in Science.

00:53.888 --> 00:57.690
Mm-hmm. Miracles of modern medicine.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.862
Right. (CHUCKLING)

science and faith are not

01:55.716 --> 01:58.083

everyone around me.

01:58.118 --> 02:01.386

for the choices I make.

02:02.763 --> 02:05.264

02:23.910 --> 02:25.642

about the butterflies?

the important things.
