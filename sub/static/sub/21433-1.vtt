02:33.219 --> 02:37.422
- Miranda and
Cassidy, we're ready for you.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.193
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:15.195 --> 03:16.428
- Hi, girls nice to see you.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.230
This is Mitchell
from the network.

03:18.232 --> 03:21.633
- Hey, guys, let's take
this for a spin, okay.

03:21.635 --> 03:25.804
So, Miranda, your character
is kind of a hipster

03:27.207 --> 03:30.375
but sort of brainy but
still sexy and approachable.

03:31.778 --> 03:35.614
Cassidy, you're reading the
landlord whenever you're ready.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.748
- I'm sorry one second.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.817
I thought I was reading Hannah?

03:38.819 --> 03:42.354
- Did they give
you the wrong sides?

03:42.356 --> 03:44.590
- No, it just says mid 30s.

03:47.729 --> 03:48.628
No, never mind.

03:48.629 --> 03:53.832
It's totally fine just give
me one second to look it over.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.868
- Just gonna be a minute.
- Yeah, I know.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.604
- Okay, got it cool.

03:58.606 --> 04:01.240
- Okay, perfect
whenever you're ready.

04:01.242 --> 04:02.307
Slate first.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.311
- Hi, I'm Miranda Delonge.

04:06.946 --> 04:08.847
- Hi, I'm Cassidy Harper.

04:32.405 --> 04:34.606
- Fired, for what?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.942
- Look I need to talk
to you about something.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.043
- Okay.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.345
- I need to borrow $1400.

04:40.880 --> 04:42.481
- Are you bananas?

04:42.483 --> 04:43.415
- They're gonna
kick me out of the apartment

04:43.417 --> 04:44.616
if I don't pay the back rent.

04:44.618 --> 04:45.817
- I thought you were
gonna get a roommate.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.486
- I interviewed
Craigslist people.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.821
One of them had a tarantula.

04:50.890 --> 04:52.691
- Isn't Ray's name
still on that lease?

04:52.693 --> 04:54.960
- I have not talked
to ray in months.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.495
- Well, I don't have it.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.764
- Okay, well, then do
you have some boxes

04:58.766 --> 05:00.365
cause I'm gonna need to
sleep under a bridge,

05:00.367 --> 05:01.800
and I hear if you make
a mattress out of them

05:01.802 --> 05:03.568
that keeps you from
getting frostbite.

05:03.570 --> 05:05.704
- Do you think I have some
secret vault someplace?

05:05.706 --> 05:08.073
- You know I will pay you back.

05:08.075 --> 05:11.009
- Oh, I know for a
fact that you won't.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.979
How are you gonna pay
for next month's rent.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.714
I think that you should
come and live with me

05:15.716 --> 05:16.815
until you can save
up some money.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.850
- No, absolutely not.

05:18.852 --> 05:20.018
- Alright, alright

05:20.020 --> 05:20.986
there's a liquor store
across the street

05:20.988 --> 05:22.321
I'm sure they have some boxes.

05:22.323 --> 05:23.989
- Why are you being
so awful to me?

05:23.991 --> 05:26.558
An artist's life is like
this sometimes, mom.

05:26.560 --> 05:27.726
- Do you think I'm so fulfilled

05:27.728 --> 05:29.728
working in a perfume counter?

05:29.730 --> 05:31.863
By four o'clock my
right eye is twitching.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.031
You know what's
gonna happen to you.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.633
You're gonna end of
marrying the first

05:34.635 --> 05:36.001
hairy slob who comes along
who can pay your bills.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.370
Is that what you wanna
be, somebody's concubine.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.471
- You know what forget it.

05:39.473 --> 05:41.640
I'm sorry I bothered you.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.684
Fine.

05:54.687 --> 05:57.889
But just until I get
my shit together.

05:58.958 --> 05:59.891
Can I have a little
cash just for now

05:59.893 --> 06:02.494
just for walking around money.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.096
- You're welcome.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.684
- Are you going out?

06:26.753 --> 06:28.587
- Yes, he'll be here any minute.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.589
- Who?

06:31.758 --> 06:33.725
- A guy I've been seeing.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.460
I met him at the gym.

06:35.462 --> 06:36.795
- I thought you went to curves?

06:36.797 --> 06:37.896
- I switched.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.732
It smelled like soup, all right.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.134
No cigarettes.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.937
- You are too trusting.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.139
You don't know this guy.

06:47.141 --> 06:49.408
What if he's another
Dan Danielson.

06:49.410 --> 06:52.577
- The guy with the parrot?

06:52.579 --> 06:53.779
He was okay.

06:53.781 --> 06:54.713
I can't believe
you remember him.

06:54.715 --> 06:56.915
- That bird was aggressive.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.064
Just please will you stay
in well lighted areas?

07:03.856 --> 07:04.856
- Hello.

07:05.825 --> 07:08.493
Okay, tell him
I'll be right down.

07:10.096 --> 07:13.832
There is a low fat stir
fry in the freezer.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.036
Listen just I want
you to stay here,

07:18.038 --> 07:20.705
and I want you to think about

07:21.741 --> 07:25.477
I want you to think
about your future, okay?

07:27.513 --> 07:28.447
Does this look okay?

07:28.449 --> 07:29.581
- Yes, you look hot.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.682
- Okay, okay.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.918
Alright don't wait up.

07:33.619 --> 07:34.853
- Ugh, gross.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.180
- Hey,

08:04.250 --> 08:07.018
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

08:07.020 --> 08:08.553
- I fell asleep.

08:09.055 --> 08:11.022
- Yeah,

08:11.024 --> 08:12.491
I can see that.

08:14.026 --> 08:15.494
Feeling better?

08:16.028 --> 08:17.095
- I feel wretched.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.598
How was your date?

08:20.132 --> 08:21.533
- It was nice.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.604
I actually have some
good news for you.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.106
- Am I getting a new daddy?

08:29.175 --> 08:31.910
- The man I was out
with he has a business,

08:31.912 --> 08:33.778
and he's hiring so.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.580
- Oh, dear lord.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.183
- Oh, come on,
Cassie, it's a job.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.852
- What does he do?

08:41.687 --> 08:42.953
- He's in the diamond business.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.956
- I don't wanna be a saleslady.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.292
I don't know anything
about jewelry.

08:47.294 --> 08:49.060
- You are so ungrateful
forget the card.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.962
- No, no, no I'll go.

08:52.064 --> 08:55.133
I'm sorry thank you
I appreciate it.

08:55.868 --> 08:56.968
- You should go home.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.136
Get some sleep.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.771
You look terrible.

09:21.093 --> 09:22.627
- Hey.

09:23.262 --> 09:24.629
- Hey.

09:25.698 --> 09:26.831
- Hey, ha, what?

09:26.833 --> 09:27.833
Don't you

09:59.065 --> 10:00.265
- Alright, man, come on.
- Shut up, shut up.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.633
- Okay guys, guys, guys.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.068
I'm gonna get.
- I'm gonna get.

10:03.070 --> 10:04.102
Guys, guys, guys, I'm gonna get.

10:04.104 --> 10:05.303
I'm gonna get.

10:05.905 --> 10:06.671
- Sit down.

10:06.673 --> 10:10.108
See you're running, but
I know where you work.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.378
Alright so why waste all
of that effort tell me?

10:13.380 --> 10:14.245
- I don't know.

10:14.247 --> 10:14.245
I freaked out.

10:14.247 --> 10:18.149
- Well, I'm gonna assume
that if you had my money

10:18.151 --> 10:20.251
this little track meet
wouldn't have happened.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.622
- Look I need like
three days, okay, okay.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.757
- Listen when I agreed
to loan you this money

10:25.759 --> 10:27.759
I explained to you, you
were actually borrowing

10:27.761 --> 10:27.759
it from my employer.

10:27.761 --> 10:31.863
Now I assumed you were
familiar with his reputation.

10:31.865 --> 10:33.098
- Please explain
to Lil pop that I...

10:33.100 --> 10:35.100
- no, no one needs to
explain anything to pop.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.901
Someone needs to explain to you

10:36.903 --> 10:39.237
that our repayment
schedule is inflexible.

10:39.239 --> 10:43.241
Ask your friend Hiram how
pop feels about excuses.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.909
- Hiram Gladstone?

10:46.212 --> 10:47.412
The zoo thing?

10:48.948 --> 10:50.849
Pop was the one that tied
him up to a wolf habitat?

10:50.851 --> 10:53.718
- Well, do you
like animals, huh?

10:54.654 --> 10:56.855
I'm adding two points a week.

10:56.857 --> 10:57.937
- Come on.
- Yes.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.194
I don't appreciate being
made to run in these clothes.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.667
- Fuck.

11:38.964 --> 11:41.366
- No hurry just come
in whenever you feel like it.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.767
- We open yet?

11:42.769 --> 11:45.870
God forbid what'd you have to
answer the phone or something

11:45.872 --> 11:48.039
I'd never forgive myself.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.109
We open at 10.

11:51.977 --> 11:54.312
- Hi, hi, I'm looking for Barry.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.881
- What can I do for you?

11:56.883 --> 12:00.118
- I'm supposed to hopefully
start working here today.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.352
- Right, sorry.

12:06.058 --> 12:06.925
Hi.
- Hi.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.259
- Sorry, come in.

12:08.261 --> 12:09.828
- Cassidy.
- Alex.

12:10.463 --> 12:12.263
- I'm supposed to ask for Barry.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.399
- Yeah, that's my father.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.401
He'll be out here in
a minute to act weird

12:16.403 --> 12:18.403
and make you feel uncomfortable.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.004
How much do you
know about the job?

12:20.006 --> 12:21.473
- I know that this
is your address

12:21.475 --> 12:23.408
and that I was supposed
to be here at 10.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.510
I'm early that's good, right?

12:25.512 --> 12:26.512
- Yeah.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.847
Well, it's not complicated.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.415
Basically we have to
take these stones,

12:30.417 --> 12:33.051
and we get them to other
shops in the neighborhood

12:33.053 --> 12:34.853
as discretely as possible.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.421
We used to use a
big security firm,

12:36.423 --> 12:36.421
but they kept getting robbed.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.325
It was actually gangs of
Columbians who specialize in it,

12:40.327 --> 12:42.460
so now we do what
they did 50 years ago.

12:42.462 --> 12:44.896
We hire a pretty girl
that no one would suspect,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.031
and she just puts
them in her pocket

12:47.033 --> 12:49.234
and takes them where
they need to go.

12:49.236 --> 12:50.902
- Well, that sounds dangerous.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.070
- It's not.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.371
- Well, what happens
if I get robbed?

12:53.373 --> 12:54.773
- Well, you just give
it to them right away.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.175
Don't fight we have insurance.

12:57.177 --> 12:59.043
- How do you know
you can trust me?

12:59.045 --> 13:01.846
- I don't, but we
have insurance.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.282
- Hey, you must
be val's daughter.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.084
- Cassidy.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.552
- You're gonna be great.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.053
What a beautiful girl you are.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.388
- Why thank you.

13:11.490 --> 13:13.191
You know, you have
an amazing voice.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.293
Have you ever considered
trying to do VOICEOVER work.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.529
It's actually very lucrative.

13:17.531 --> 13:19.197
- Thanks but I have
enough disappointment

13:19.199 --> 13:20.565
in my life already.

13:20.567 --> 13:23.067
One thing you can't
dress like that.

13:23.069 --> 13:23.067
- Like what?

13:23.069 --> 13:25.403
- You look like Stevie
nicks and everything

13:25.405 --> 13:26.938
but that's not what I want.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.806
Jeans, simple.

13:27.808 --> 13:28.807
- Okay, got it.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.041
- It's easy misdirection

13:30.043 --> 13:31.309
like the magician at a
kid's birthday party.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.211
Get them to look at the
little birdie up here

13:33.213 --> 13:35.446
take their wallet
with the other hand.

13:35.448 --> 13:37.415
- I should mention I'm
gonna need to leave

13:37.417 --> 13:39.250
from time to time for auditions.

13:39.252 --> 13:41.586
I'm sort of in demand right now.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.888
There's actually a cop
show that I'm up for,

13:43.890 --> 13:46.491
but I'll keep you
both in the loop.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.859
- I'm sure we can figure it out.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.494
What about the
insurance company?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.095
- I left a letter
on your desktop.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.431
- There's no letter on my desk.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.899
- On your computer desktop.

13:54.901 --> 13:56.501
- We keep having
this conversation.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.936
Efficiency every
dollar you waste

13:57.938 --> 14:00.471
adds another day until I retire.

14:01.307 --> 14:03.908
Do good tell your mom I said hi.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.277
- He seems okay.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.179
- Yeah, he's a doll.

14:09.148 --> 14:12.183
Anyway when you're
not schlepping around,

14:13.452 --> 14:14.986
you can be here helping us
with doing filing stuff.

14:14.988 --> 14:16.321
I actually have a
delivery for you right now

14:16.323 --> 14:17.856
if you're up for it.

14:17.858 --> 14:20.525
Yeah, you'll be going to Hatoum,

14:21.360 --> 14:23.094
which is 224 south Wabash.

14:24.263 --> 14:27.999
So just put this in your
pocket just be cool.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.167
- That's it.

14:29.169 --> 14:31.035
- Yeah, we already
had you bonded.

14:31.037 --> 14:32.303
Just sign here.

14:35.341 --> 14:36.441
- What happened to the last girl

14:36.443 --> 14:37.976
that did this job?

14:37.978 --> 14:40.445
- She was killed in a robbery.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.885
- What's in the envelope?

14:46.887 --> 14:47.986
- Two diamonds.

14:47.988 --> 14:49.387
- Worth how much?

14:50.022 --> 14:51.055
- About 23,5.

14:51.423 --> 14:52.423
- Shit.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.659
- Why don't you come
right back here afterwards

14:54.661 --> 14:57.061
I have another delivery for you.

14:57.063 --> 14:59.597
- Okay, here I go wish me luck.

15:00.199 --> 15:01.232
- Vaya con Dios.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.321
- I like your earrings.

15:23.323 --> 15:25.056
Is that tourmaline?

15:25.591 --> 15:27.458
- Sorry me no English.

15:46.478 --> 15:49.113
- Here, here, here, here you go.

15:49.115 --> 15:49.981
- Thank you.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.716
- Okay, ba-bye.

15:53.619 --> 15:55.420
- Yeah, that's really it.

15:55.422 --> 15:57.722
I just bring the stuff to
the other stores in the area.

15:57.724 --> 15:58.957
When there's no deliveries,

15:58.959 --> 16:00.091
do a little computer stuff.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.659
Easy peasy Japanesey.

16:01.661 --> 16:04.729
- Well, try to pick
up a few things.

16:05.564 --> 16:06.698
You know learning a trade

16:06.700 --> 16:07.632
that could be really
great for you.

16:07.634 --> 16:10.034
- I have a trade thank you.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.003
Gross look at this picture

16:12.005 --> 16:13.571
that Tanya just
posted to Instagram.

16:13.573 --> 16:15.239
It's actually sad.

16:17.142 --> 16:18.509
- Is that the quantum leap guy?

16:18.511 --> 16:19.511
- Uh-huh.

16:20.512 --> 16:22.413
- Man, she's really
doing great, huh?

16:22.415 --> 16:25.283
- Please she
did like one commercial.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.185
- Well, it's a start.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.023
- I'm actually thinking of
going back out there myself.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.125
It'll be different this time.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.995
I'm in a much better
place emotionally.

16:36.997 --> 16:38.563
- You really wanna subject
yourself to another

16:38.565 --> 16:39.731
best defense.

16:40.532 --> 16:42.500
- One time eight years ago

16:42.502 --> 16:44.769
we are still having
this conversation.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.739
- Well, it's a
legitimate question.

16:49.174 --> 16:52.310
Alright we can talk about
something else fine.

16:55.781 --> 16:59.317
- So you and Barry
are you like serious?

17:01.420 --> 17:02.687
- I don't know.

17:04.022 --> 17:07.759
We've only been on a few
days, but I like him.

17:08.493 --> 17:09.660
Yeah, he's funny,

17:10.496 --> 17:12.597
and he listens to me, he does.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.565
You know he's not just waiting

17:14.567 --> 17:17.300
until the next time
he has to talk,

17:18.037 --> 17:18.770
and he's old fashioned.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.371
He always grabs for the check.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.240
- I thought a modern woman

17:22.242 --> 17:24.275
should always pay her own way?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.711
- No, it's to
emasculating that way.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.813
Yeah, it makes it hard for
him to be the aggressor.

17:28.815 --> 17:31.349
- Oh, god, mom, please stop.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.518
- You know sometimes
it would be nice

17:33.520 --> 17:35.319
to get a little support
from you for once.

17:35.321 --> 17:36.587
- You're right.

17:37.689 --> 17:40.091
Tell me about his
dick is it thick?

17:40.093 --> 17:41.292
- What?
- Veiny.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.594
- What get that
out of your mouth.

17:43.596 --> 17:45.463
- Come on, Valerie,
can we please

17:45.465 --> 17:47.331
get the fingerprints
on the glass?

17:47.333 --> 17:50.535
It looks like somebody's
been eating ribs over here.

17:50.537 --> 17:51.736
- Sure, Wendy.

17:52.805 --> 17:54.505
- Dude, you gotta
get out of here.

17:54.507 --> 17:57.308
- No, I am not starting
from the bottom again.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.744
I've got nine years
till social security.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.446
If I don't die from
inhaling Shalimar,

18:01.448 --> 18:02.547
I'll be fine.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.278
- Here's the stuff from Meyer,

19:07.280 --> 19:10.681
and I already filed the
stuff from Algonquin.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.650
- You've got this down.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.452
- Well, I did go to college.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.586
- What'd you study?

19:15.588 --> 19:16.588
- Theater.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.291
- I don't think that counts.

19:20.293 --> 19:21.726
- The fruits of your labor.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.793
- Thank you.

19:28.834 --> 19:32.470
Barry, Barry, are you
sure this is right?

19:33.572 --> 19:35.173
- What did you think
it was gonna be?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.275
- Well, we never
actually talked about...

19:37.277 --> 19:40.478
- well, now you know
see you tomorrow.

19:42.915 --> 19:43.915
- Sorry.

19:44.583 --> 19:45.416
- This is pitiful.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.717
How am I supposed

19:47.719 --> 19:48.999
- saving for
something important?

19:54.326 --> 19:57.495
- Hey, will you teach
me something about

19:57.497 --> 19:59.564
I don't know this stuff?

20:00.399 --> 20:01.566
- What do you wanna know?

20:01.568 --> 20:02.800
- I don't know.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.238
Show me the difference
between diamonds.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.240
- Okay.

20:10.576 --> 20:11.809
Come over here.

20:16.215 --> 20:17.215
Stay here.

20:23.555 --> 20:24.555
- Fucking FICA.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.568
- Now each part of the
diamond has a name.

20:38.637 --> 20:39.937
The top half is
called the crown,

20:39.939 --> 20:41.339
the bottom is the pavilion,

20:41.341 --> 20:43.774
the point at the
bottom is the Culet,

20:43.776 --> 20:46.377
and then the flat part on
top is called the table.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.645
- How much is this one worth?

20:47.647 --> 20:50.414
- This is a five caret diamond

20:51.483 --> 20:53.784
ideal cut, hearts and
arrows, gs-1 color

20:53.786 --> 20:55.553
retails around 180.

20:56.822 --> 20:58.623
- Dude, seriously you
guys have that much money?

20:58.625 --> 20:59.657
- It's all credit.

20:59.659 --> 21:00.825
We get stones in on memo.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.527
We sell what we can,
and we return the rest.

21:03.529 --> 21:04.895
If my dad could
liquidate and retire

21:04.897 --> 21:06.464
believe me he would.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.366
- I gotta say it just looks
like all the other ones.

21:08.368 --> 21:09.967
Maybe a little bigger.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.769
- No, it has no inclusions.

21:11.771 --> 21:12.770
Those are the little flaws

21:12.772 --> 21:13.771
that interfere with the light

21:13.773 --> 21:15.940
that passes through the diamond.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.909
- I don't approve of that
kind of perfectionism.

21:18.911 --> 21:21.412
I think flaws
should be embraced.

21:21.414 --> 21:22.414
- Yeah.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.316
- If I ever get engaged,

21:26.585 --> 21:28.753
I hope my fiance gives me
a ring that's all flaws.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.956
- Well, as long as
he buys it from me.

21:35.527 --> 21:36.827
I should put this back.

21:36.829 --> 21:38.663
Would you mind getting that?

21:40.933 --> 21:43.401
- Why butch Cassidy Harper,
as I live and breathe.

21:43.403 --> 21:44.835
- What are you doing here, ray?

21:44.837 --> 21:47.438
- I'm interested in some
expensive and vulgar jewelry.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.607
- Hey, hey, hey
is everything okay?

21:49.609 --> 21:50.975
- Who the fuck is this then?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.376
- That's my boss.
- Who the fuck am I, man.

21:52.378 --> 21:53.544
Who the fuck are you?

21:53.546 --> 21:54.779
- Look at this a tough guy.

21:54.781 --> 21:55.713
That bat better have
a little gun in it.

21:55.715 --> 21:56.714
- Ray, you need to go.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.982
- No, no, no let him stay.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.483
I pushed the button
for the alarm.

21:59.485 --> 22:00.718
The cops will be
here any minute.

22:00.720 --> 22:01.986
They'd love to kick
the shit out of him.

22:01.988 --> 22:03.587
- Ray, I work here.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.588
Why would you come here?

22:04.590 --> 22:04.588
How did you find me?

22:04.590 --> 22:07.725
- I don't know I saw you
walking downtown this afternoon.

22:07.727 --> 22:08.726
I sort of followed you.

22:08.728 --> 22:10.461
- What the fuck, ray?

22:10.463 --> 22:12.363
Do I need to get a
restraining order?

22:12.365 --> 22:13.964
- No, of course not I would...

22:13.966 --> 22:14.966
Fuck.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.101
Sorry, Cass, really.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.336
I'm sorry I just
wanna talk is all.

22:18.338 --> 22:19.670
Will you call me?
- Go.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.405
- Okay, sorry, sorry,
boss man not her fault.

22:21.407 --> 22:23.741
I'm an idiot.
- She said go.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.378
- Okay, sorry, Cass.

22:27.779 --> 22:28.779
Sorry, Cass.

22:29.981 --> 22:31.449
Please call there's some
stuff I need to say, okay.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.917
Okay, I'm leaving.

22:37.556 --> 22:39.557
It was good to see you.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.428
- I am so sorry.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.364
- Not your fault.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.565
- I don't need my
radioactive life

22:47.567 --> 22:50.034
contaminating your
office goddamn him.

22:50.036 --> 22:51.535
- Look it's okay.

22:51.537 --> 22:54.138
Really, really it's no big deal.

22:55.006 --> 22:56.040
How about we go get dinner.

22:56.042 --> 22:58.442
I'm starving come on I'm buying.

22:58.444 --> 22:59.643
- You don't need to do that.

22:59.645 --> 23:00.978
- No, I want to.

23:02.013 --> 23:02.747
I'm gonna go get
my coat don't move.

23:02.749 --> 23:03.749
Stay here.

23:08.855 --> 23:10.521
Believe me I'm not
hanging around here

23:10.523 --> 23:13.724
waiting to take over
the family business.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.428
Forgive me but I'm aiming for
something higher than that.

23:17.430 --> 23:18.863
I've got a couple things
going on right now.

23:18.865 --> 23:20.064
- Yeah.-
Yeah.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.799
Some businesses I'm
trying to start up.

23:21.801 --> 23:25.669
I'm actually working on
something huge actually.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.872
I wanna tell you about it,
but you can't talk about it

23:27.874 --> 23:29.173
especially with my dad

23:29.175 --> 23:31.675
and your mom too I guess.
- No, of course.

23:31.677 --> 23:33.677
- I was in the
Caribbean last year,

23:33.679 --> 23:36.747
and I went to this
island called Dominica.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.949
They make this
incredible rum there

23:38.951 --> 23:40.618
like insanely delicious.

23:40.620 --> 23:44.822
The legend is, is that it
even helps men, you know

23:45.824 --> 23:47.625
- get raging boners.

23:48.059 --> 23:48.793
- Basically.

23:48.795 --> 23:49.860
- Does it work?

23:50.162 --> 23:51.162
- Yes.

23:52.164 --> 23:53.564
- Liquor and boners sound
like the kind of thing

23:53.566 --> 23:55.433
old white dudes
would be really into.

23:55.435 --> 23:56.734
- I know right.

23:57.769 --> 23:58.736
- Can you get the
eagles in there somehow?

23:58.738 --> 23:59.970
- Look if this thing takes off,

23:59.972 --> 24:01.872
I could be sitting on
a giant pile of money

24:01.874 --> 24:03.908
like a fucking fortune.

24:04.509 --> 24:05.543
- Okay, but

24:05.545 --> 24:10.014
- but customs seized it
at the airport because

24:10.016 --> 24:13.784
the secret ingredient
wasn't exactly legal.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.086
So I've got 80
cases sitting in a

24:16.088 --> 24:18.456
homeland security
warehouse at O'Hare.

24:18.458 --> 24:19.457
- Oops.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.658
- Yeah.

24:20.660 --> 24:21.859
I talked to a lawyer
who says he could help

24:21.861 --> 24:23.961
but he wants 15,000 up
front as a retainer,

24:23.963 --> 24:26.564
and then like another
80k to get it approved.

24:26.566 --> 24:30.768
Every dollar I could borrow
went to buying this shit.

24:31.603 --> 24:32.770
I need more than just taking

24:32.772 --> 24:33.604
a little bit out
of each pay check.

24:33.606 --> 24:34.872
I need a score.

24:35.474 --> 24:36.540
- Oh, a score.

24:36.542 --> 24:40.478
You're gonna knock over
a 7-11 or something?

24:42.481 --> 24:44.615
- I wanna talk to
you about something,

24:44.617 --> 24:46.584
and I want you to know
that you can say no

24:46.586 --> 24:49.153
and I'm not gonna get mad
or fire you or anything.

24:49.155 --> 24:53.557
But I have a way that we
could make some serious money.

24:53.992 --> 24:54.992
But it's shady.

24:56.027 --> 24:58.896
- I'm not necessarily
opposed to shady.

24:59.931 --> 25:00.898
- So let's say you're
making a delivery,

25:00.900 --> 25:02.233
and let's say you get robbed.

25:02.235 --> 25:03.868
Well, the insurance
company pays out the loss,

25:03.870 --> 25:05.503
and the business
doesn't get hurt.

25:05.505 --> 25:06.670
- Okay.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.105
- But let's say
when you get robbed

25:08.107 --> 25:09.907
instead of giving the robber
the stones you were carrying

25:09.909 --> 25:11.709
you give him some dummy package.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.611
He thinks he's
getting the stones,

25:13.613 --> 25:15.045
but he's actually getting fakes.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.014
- And I keep the real ones.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.048
- That's right,

25:18.050 --> 25:19.183
and then I sell them

25:19.185 --> 25:21.185
and we split the money.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.087
- Couldn't we just
say I got robbed

25:23.089 --> 25:24.522
and do the same thing?

25:24.524 --> 25:26.190
- These insurance people
they don't fuck around.

25:26.192 --> 25:27.625
It has to be real.

25:27.627 --> 25:31.061
We need a police report,
hopefully an eyewitness.

25:31.063 --> 25:33.898
If you get caught defrauding
an insurance company,

25:33.900 --> 25:35.032
it's no joke.

25:36.101 --> 25:37.301
I'm talking orange
jump suit time.

25:37.303 --> 25:38.869
You don't get to play
tennis in Wisconsin.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.037
But if the robbery is real,

25:40.039 --> 25:42.840
then nobody is
defrauding anyone.

25:44.009 --> 25:45.609
The robber just gets
something that isn't valuable,

25:45.611 --> 25:47.111
and the insurance company
pays out such a small amount

25:47.113 --> 25:49.246
that it's just like a
blip on their radar.

25:49.248 --> 25:52.182
It's virtually a
victimless crime.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.219
Thanks.

25:57.322 --> 26:00.224
Here's the thing though
I need you to get robbed.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.792
I mean I could hire
somebody to do it,

26:01.794 --> 26:02.960
but then we would
have to cut him in.

26:02.962 --> 26:04.962
Plus he could get picked
up for somebody else

26:04.964 --> 26:06.330
and then he could rat me out.

26:06.332 --> 26:08.165
We gotta minimize our risk.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.667
- Couldn't I just
be super obvious

26:09.669 --> 26:11.702
when I'm making my
deliveries or something?

26:11.704 --> 26:13.671
- That would take too long.

26:13.673 --> 26:16.707
It's gotta be somebody who
knows what you do for a living,

26:16.709 --> 26:18.075
is a little sketchy,

26:18.077 --> 26:22.012
and would maybe break the
law to make some extra money.

26:22.014 --> 26:23.647
- Oh, my god ray.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.716
- How much of a dirt bag is he?

26:25.718 --> 26:28.252
- No, no, no, no
he wouldn't do it.

26:28.254 --> 26:30.187
- Why what does he do?

26:31.356 --> 26:33.958
- He's a pretty
unsuccessful drug dealer.

26:35.193 --> 26:36.994
- I can see why he wouldn't
wanna mess with that.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.195
- He likes me.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.130
He's not gonna rob me.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.732
- How hard can it be for
a professional actress

26:41.734 --> 26:45.869
to convince a drug dealer
to do somebody immoral?

26:49.842 --> 26:51.208
I like that.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.277
- I gotta say you don't
look much like a handleman.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.946
- Well, truth be told I'm not.

26:57.215 --> 26:58.816
My dad changed our name when
he got into the business

26:58.818 --> 27:01.885
so people would take
him more seriously.

27:01.887 --> 27:03.287
We used to be the Campbells.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.221
- Seriously?

27:04.223 --> 27:05.223
- Yep.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.891
- How could you let him do that?

27:07.893 --> 27:11.228
- I was like two they
didn't consult me.

27:19.671 --> 27:20.671
- This is

27:21.206 --> 27:22.640
oh, my god, oh my god

27:22.642 --> 27:24.942
this is totally gonna work.

27:25.744 --> 27:26.677
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

27:26.679 --> 27:27.645
Yeah, I'm gonna make it happen.

27:27.647 --> 27:29.913
I'll call ray in the morning.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.250
Maybe I try to make
him think that if

27:34.052 --> 27:35.786
he had money I'd take him back.

27:35.788 --> 27:39.423
I'm not even sure that's a
lie to tell you the truth.

27:39.425 --> 27:41.025
- Will that work?

27:42.093 --> 27:43.794
- Ray's a fuck up,
but he loves me

27:43.796 --> 27:46.997
and apparently I am
a terrible person.

27:59.844 --> 28:02.746
- I don't think
we should do this.

28:03.381 --> 28:05.015
Just not right now, okay.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.887
I just think we need to
keep our heads on straight

28:09.889 --> 28:11.455
keep clear headed
right now, okay.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.124
I'm not saying no at all just

28:14.826 --> 28:16.093
just not now, okay.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.795
- Yeah, totally.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.102
Thank you for dinner.

28:25.870 --> 28:26.870
- Yeah.

28:34.746 --> 28:35.746
Bye.

28:39.117 --> 28:40.117
Dammit.

28:51.129 --> 28:53.997
Hey, I'll be there
in 20 minutes.

28:54.799 --> 28:56.467
How much do you have?

28:57.969 --> 28:59.236
This is a fake.

29:00.071 --> 29:02.106
Chain is brass, this is glass.

29:03.007 --> 29:04.007
Real, ish.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.011
- What do you mean "ish"?

29:08.013 --> 29:10.314
- That there's a ton of flaws.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.849
Actually it's a
really shitty diamond.

29:11.851 --> 29:13.016
- Thank you, thank you.

29:13.018 --> 29:13.884
I know what the
word flaws means.

29:13.886 --> 29:14.886
How much?

29:15.920 --> 29:16.920
- 400.

29:17.856 --> 29:18.856
- No.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.357
Let's do 800

29:21.426 --> 29:23.761
unless you'd rather
go down to the tip top

29:23.763 --> 29:25.095
and talk to Lil pop directly.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.830
- You take all the cash
and just give it to him.

29:26.832 --> 29:26.830
You don't put any
in your pocket?

29:26.832 --> 29:30.467
- What happens on my end is
none of your fucking business.

29:30.469 --> 29:32.870
- Look how long we've
been doing this?

29:32.872 --> 29:34.772
You and I we make decent
walking around money

29:34.774 --> 29:36.840
out of this arrangement
or it doesn't work.

29:36.842 --> 29:38.175
Don't be greedy.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.512
I'll give you 550,
but that's it.

29:42.981 --> 29:45.516
- Damn, what they say
about your people is true.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.551
- That we're excellent dancers.

29:47.553 --> 29:48.852
- No, that's farfetched.

29:48.854 --> 29:51.188
- Okay, 1650 including
the bracelet?

29:51.190 --> 29:52.190
- Yep.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.093
It's 10:30.

29:56.095 --> 29:57.294
- Alright thank you.

29:57.296 --> 29:58.829
One of you go get
the car, please.

29:58.831 --> 30:00.097
- They got a bathroom I can use?

30:00.099 --> 30:01.865
- No, hold it.

30:01.867 --> 30:05.135
- Come on man be a fucking pro.

30:07.839 --> 30:09.106
- There's a bathroom
right down the hall.

30:09.108 --> 30:12.976
- I'm teaching them a
lesson in self-control.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.546
- This is 2600.

30:16.815 --> 30:18.816
- I must have contracted
some exotic parasite

30:18.818 --> 30:20.517
that affects my hearing.

30:20.519 --> 30:23.086
- Look I can't buy all
this stuff and pay you,

30:23.088 --> 30:24.087
and but if you give
me until Friday,

30:24.089 --> 30:25.155
I can do both.

30:25.157 --> 30:26.557
- Alex, look you realize

30:26.559 --> 30:28.826
you're only paying the points.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.360
You're even touching
the principal.

30:30.362 --> 30:33.063
- Spare me the
economics lesson, okay.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.165
- You stupid little, bitch.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.867
You know, you have
some terrible manners

30:36.869 --> 30:38.869
for somebody asking for a favor.

30:38.871 --> 30:40.304
Alright see now I
have to go to pop

30:40.306 --> 30:41.839
and ask him to be patient

30:41.841 --> 30:44.875
because you're a
spendthrift motherfucker.

30:44.877 --> 30:47.077
Dude, you are
setting yourself up

30:47.079 --> 30:49.046
for a conversation with a person

30:49.048 --> 30:52.449
with a more limited
vocabulary than mine.

30:53.985 --> 30:57.254
- So, I run back inside and
grab a box like a shoe box

30:57.256 --> 30:59.156
and put a t-shirt
in the bottom of it

30:59.158 --> 31:01.258
and come back outside
and gently lift this

31:01.260 --> 31:02.993
little guy up and
put him in the box.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.863
I should remind you that I'm
fucking terrified of birds

31:05.865 --> 31:07.064
like Tippi Hedren
level stressed.

31:07.066 --> 31:09.266
- Yeah, I remember
when that pigeon

31:09.268 --> 31:13.003
chased you off the bench.

31:13.005 --> 31:16.940
- Anyway, so I gently
lift this little guy up

31:18.009 --> 31:20.277
and put him in the box
and he is so small.

31:20.279 --> 31:23.280
I mean he weighed like
nothing, like colored air.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.382
Then I have this swell of love

31:25.384 --> 31:27.351
like a father's love for it.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.456
So I lift the little guy up,
and I put him in the box.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.424
I bring the box inside and
put the box by the window

31:34.426 --> 31:37.261
with the sun shining on it,
try to warm him up a bit.

31:37.263 --> 31:40.430
I'm feeling like Saint
Francis all heroic.

31:40.432 --> 31:44.368
I look up the number for animal
control I think it's called.

31:44.370 --> 31:46.270
I tell them I've
got an injured bird

31:46.272 --> 31:48.972
that flew into my
window and of course

31:48.974 --> 31:50.173
yes, you can have that.

31:50.175 --> 31:51.575
Of course they think
I've gone gorilla tits

31:51.577 --> 31:53.443
and they tell me there's
nothing they can do about it.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.245
Just make sure he's
in a safe place,

31:55.247 --> 31:56.513
and he'll either get
better or he won't

31:56.515 --> 31:59.016
which means, yeah, of course.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.318
So I go back inside and
go over to the window,

32:01.320 --> 32:02.986
and the box is empty.

32:02.988 --> 32:04.187
What the fuck?

32:05.256 --> 32:05.255
That's when I hear
this noise like this

32:05.257 --> 32:10.427
this like low growling
noise like.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.696
I forgot Joe has a cat Mortimer.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.598
Manky little thing stays
under the bed all day.

32:14.600 --> 32:16.366
Swear I've seen him
twice since I moved in,

32:16.368 --> 32:18.368
and Mortimer is batting
this poor little bird

32:18.370 --> 32:19.403
around the apartment like

32:19.405 --> 32:20.237
- oh, god.
- Jimmy fucking Conners

32:20.239 --> 32:21.471
whack, whack, whack.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.340
So I run over to get
the cat off of him,

32:23.342 --> 32:25.642
and trip on Joe's poncey
fucking skateboard

32:25.644 --> 32:27.477
and bang my arm on the radiator.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.079
Now that's how I did it.

32:29.081 --> 32:30.113
Fractured wrist.

32:30.115 --> 32:31.281
- Poor buddy.

32:32.350 --> 32:33.483
- He was pretty badly
hurt to begin with.

32:33.485 --> 32:34.351
I probably just
hastened his demise.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.153
- I meant you, dummy.

32:37.221 --> 32:40.657
- Yeah, well, patron
Saint of last causes.

32:41.659 --> 32:42.993
- Long shots.

32:45.330 --> 32:49.533
- You know that thing's been
expunged from my record now.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.975
- Come on, man.
- Get of me.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.011
Fucker, don't you put
your hands on her again.

33:01.013 --> 33:02.512
Apparently he got his
vision back in that eye,

33:02.514 --> 33:04.081
so that's a bonus.

33:04.083 --> 33:07.718
Yeah, 60 hours of anger
management it actually helped.

33:07.720 --> 33:11.121
Apparently my anger is
borne out of frustration.

33:11.123 --> 33:12.255
- What about art?

33:12.257 --> 33:13.623
- I've made some stuff.

33:13.625 --> 33:14.625
- Yeah.

33:15.393 --> 33:15.392
- Working mostly construction

33:15.394 --> 33:18.996
almost full time making
decent coin for once.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.431
In fact, your eggs are on me.

33:22.300 --> 33:23.467
- I actually got it covered.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.336
I have a new job
too as you know.

33:27.572 --> 33:29.740
- Yeah, sorry about that.

33:30.541 --> 33:32.075
What do you do there anyway?

33:32.077 --> 33:33.377
- Can you keep a secret?

33:33.379 --> 33:34.379
- No.

33:35.413 --> 33:36.279
- Well, then I'm
not gonna tell you.

33:36.281 --> 33:36.279
- My hand to god.

33:36.281 --> 33:41.184
- Alright I am a runner
for a diamond importer.

33:43.087 --> 33:44.087
- No way.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.124
What exactly is that?

33:47.126 --> 33:49.159
- Well, I basically
walk around downtown

33:49.161 --> 33:51.461
by myself delivering diamonds.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.030
- You're kidding no security.

33:53.032 --> 33:54.031
Do you carry a pistol?

33:54.033 --> 33:55.799
- Just me and my wiles.

33:57.101 --> 33:59.503
Anyway they're
insured out the WAZ.

33:59.505 --> 34:02.472
First sign of danger I'm supposed
to drop the stuff quick.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.474
- Jesus.

34:04.675 --> 34:04.674
- I don't know I feel
like I should get a friend

34:04.676 --> 34:09.478
to stage a robbery keep
the diamonds for myself.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.281
God knows I could use the money.

34:11.283 --> 34:13.250
A little financial
stability would solve like

34:13.252 --> 34:15.318
98% of my problems.

34:16.587 --> 34:17.554
- Well, if you get caught
I know three shitty lawyers

34:17.556 --> 34:20.157
and an excellent bail bondsman.

34:24.795 --> 34:26.196
- You're late.

34:27.231 --> 34:28.231
- I'm early it's
eight minutes till.

34:28.233 --> 34:29.599
- Are you sure?

34:29.601 --> 34:30.601
Am I fast?

34:31.803 --> 34:33.770
- This thing gets
its time from space so.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.371
What do you got for me today?

34:35.373 --> 34:37.174
- Three this morning I don't
know about this afternoon.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.842
- Okay, I'm gonna need
to take an early lunch.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.110
I have a 11:30 audition.

34:42.146 --> 34:44.380
- I'm sorry these hours
too taxing for you?

34:44.382 --> 34:46.349
Should I have another
courier standing by on salary

34:46.351 --> 34:48.185
in case you have
scheduling problems?

34:48.187 --> 34:49.485
- What's the matter?

34:49.487 --> 34:52.489
- I have a audition,
a really big one.

34:52.491 --> 34:53.723
- What do you care?

34:53.725 --> 34:55.092
- Well, just tell me
how it's gonna work

34:55.094 --> 34:55.859
now that we're in
second position

34:55.860 --> 34:57.160
to the young lady's dreams?

34:57.162 --> 34:58.662
Are you gonna be
schlepping stones again?

34:58.664 --> 34:59.863
Am I gonna be doing this

34:59.865 --> 35:01.164
and running around
like a Vilde Chaya?

35:01.166 --> 35:02.365
If our creditors show up today,

35:02.367 --> 35:03.567
I'd be in an audition of my own

35:03.569 --> 35:06.536
at the bottom of
the Chicago river.

35:07.238 --> 35:08.438
- It's her lunch hour.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.706
What are we running
a plantation here?

35:09.708 --> 35:10.807
Go.
- Big shot.

35:10.809 --> 35:11.875
- Thank you.

35:13.177 --> 35:14.411
Here you are you're
going here first

35:14.413 --> 35:16.113
722 state street 12 floor.

35:16.115 --> 35:17.347
Hey, come here.

35:23.754 --> 35:24.621
Hey.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.789
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.657
So how'd it go did
you talk to him?

35:27.659 --> 35:29.526
- Yeah, I just had
breakfast with him.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.461
I laid the foundation.

35:32.196 --> 35:33.396
- Just the foundation?

35:33.398 --> 35:35.665
- Well, it's in motion
I can't over sell it.

35:35.667 --> 35:37.334
- Okay, take this.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.336
- What's this?

35:39.837 --> 35:40.670
- It's the dummy stones.

35:40.672 --> 35:42.272
It's called Moissanite.

35:42.274 --> 35:43.406
It's really hard to tell the
difference even for a pro.

35:43.408 --> 35:43.406
- Well, what am I
supposed to do with it?

35:43.408 --> 35:47.410
- Keep it in your pocket at all
times always every delivery.

35:47.412 --> 35:48.812
When he finally decides
to take the bait

35:48.814 --> 35:50.747
or had somebody else
do it our whatever,

35:50.749 --> 35:54.618
then you give him this one
and you swallow the real one.

35:54.620 --> 35:55.652
- Swallow it?

35:55.654 --> 35:56.853
- I'm kidding.

35:57.355 --> 35:58.355
Sorry.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.291
Anyway just keep it on
you in different pockets.

36:01.293 --> 36:02.459
- I don't need it yet.

36:02.461 --> 36:03.660
- No, I want you to
get in the habit.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.929
You never know when
it's gonna come, okay.

36:05.931 --> 36:07.164
Let's practice.

36:07.166 --> 36:08.365
Stick them up.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.168
I'm serious stick them up.

36:11.702 --> 36:12.536
Give me the stones.

36:12.538 --> 36:13.603
- Okay, okay, okay.

36:14.605 --> 36:15.705
- That's the real one.

36:15.707 --> 36:16.573
- No, it's not.

36:16.575 --> 36:17.707
- Yes, it is.

36:18.709 --> 36:19.943
Look from now on always
keep the real one

36:19.945 --> 36:21.311
in your right pocket.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.512
- Okay, sorry.

36:23.614 --> 36:25.215
- We're not gonna have
multiple shots at this.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.817
Get your head in the game, okay.

36:30.388 --> 36:32.923
Sorry I'm being a little harsh.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.392
- Okay.
- Okay, let's get out.

36:35.394 --> 36:38.562
I don't want him to
suspect anything let's go.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.820
- No.
- That's not it.

37:05.289 --> 37:06.790
- Hold on a second we're gonna
need more energy than that.

37:06.792 --> 37:07.924
Considerably more.

37:07.926 --> 37:08.792
- Yeah, bring it on.

37:08.794 --> 37:09.759
- So do it again.

37:09.761 --> 37:12.295
- Yep, anytime you're ready.

37:12.697 --> 37:13.697
- And now.

37:14.632 --> 37:16.600
- What time did your husband
come home that night?

37:16.602 --> 37:17.767
- Does she look like a cop?

37:17.769 --> 37:18.935
- No, way too hot.

37:18.937 --> 37:19.937
- Yeah.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.339
- But she looks
like she parties.

37:22.341 --> 37:22.872
- Yeah, I think
she probably does.

37:22.874 --> 37:23.707
- You do right?

37:23.709 --> 37:25.609
You party a little bit?

37:25.910 --> 37:27.277
Yeah.

37:27.279 --> 37:28.445
- Sorry.
- So let's see some of that.

37:28.447 --> 37:29.446
A little of that
energy bring it up.

37:29.448 --> 37:31.948
- You're among friends.
- Yeah.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.017
- Do this with energy.

37:34.019 --> 37:37.887
- What time did your husband
come home that night?

37:38.723 --> 37:42.592
- Yeah I don't know.

37:42.994 --> 37:43.994
- I do.

38:29.540 --> 38:30.540
- Yes.

38:32.076 --> 38:33.643
Your mother's making
me lasagna tonight.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.045
You gonna join us for dinner?

38:35.047 --> 38:37.814
- No, don't worry I'll be
out till at least 11 or 12.

38:37.816 --> 38:38.748
- Owe you one.

38:38.750 --> 38:40.317
See you in the funny pages.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.452
You, I need those tax forms
for October by tomorrow.

38:42.454 --> 38:43.454
- Yep.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.957
So warm, isn't he?

38:48.793 --> 38:50.660
What are you up to tonight?

38:51.662 --> 38:53.496
- I'm actually
going out with ray.

38:53.498 --> 38:54.498
- Nice.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.866
You gonna dial it up a bit?

38:57.702 --> 38:59.602
- I told you I'm working on it.

39:02.573 --> 39:03.940
- You know I have to
admit I'm not thrilled

39:03.942 --> 39:07.544
about the idea of you
going out with him.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.546
- Well, it was your idea.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.949
- Yeah, well, a lot of
my ideas are fucked.

39:26.831 --> 39:29.766
- I thought we
weren't doing this?

39:34.772 --> 39:37.006
He's downstairs I gotta go.

39:37.742 --> 39:39.576
- Have a terrible time.

39:53.491 --> 39:54.758
- What is that?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.626
- What this hat?

39:57.461 --> 39:57.460
I think it belonged to my uncle.

39:57.462 --> 40:01.698
- No, dummy, that thing
you're leaning against.

40:01.700 --> 40:02.700
- Oh, that.

40:03.567 --> 40:05.068
That is a finely
tuned automobile

40:05.070 --> 40:06.636
that I recently acquired.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.672
- Holy shit you bought a car.

40:09.674 --> 40:10.940
- In fact I did.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.409
Told they call it a Cadillac.

40:12.411 --> 40:13.576
- How, where?

40:14.879 --> 40:16.513
- That lot on Cicero with
the big inflatable eagle.

40:16.515 --> 40:17.781
- Low credit, no credit

40:17.783 --> 40:19.549
that commercial is so
fucking depressing.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.084
- And yet their open
mindedness about credit

40:21.086 --> 40:24.487
histories is everything
they said it was.

40:24.489 --> 40:25.522
- How much?

40:25.524 --> 40:26.756
- Never get in.

40:32.129 --> 40:33.797
- It's comfortable.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.565
- Yeah, but I think a fat
person used to drive it though.

40:35.567 --> 40:37.901
It's a bit lumpy over there.

40:38.903 --> 40:40.770
Look I have to admit

40:43.040 --> 40:44.741
purchasing this
automobile has left me

40:44.743 --> 40:46.910
a bit of cash poor
at the moment.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.578
I intend to show you
what an excellent

40:48.580 --> 40:49.946
cheap date looks like.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.147
- Bring it on.

41:02.126 --> 41:04.060
- You should probably
put you seat belt on.

41:04.062 --> 41:05.982
I learned to drive on the
other side of the road.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.608
- This place is incredible.

41:18.610 --> 41:20.009
- Yeah, isn't it.

41:21.078 --> 41:22.145
My old roommate
Jeremy had an eel.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.214
Came here with him once.

41:25.749 --> 41:29.219
- I don't understand the
idea of a fish as a pet.

41:29.221 --> 41:31.588
It's not enough action for me.

41:31.590 --> 41:33.122
- That's you all action.

41:33.124 --> 41:36.926
Actress by day, diamond
courier by day also.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.064
How was work by the way?

41:41.565 --> 41:42.565
- Fine.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.170
I can't believe they
let me walk around

41:47.172 --> 41:49.172
with that kind of loot.

41:49.907 --> 41:51.841
I did a delivery today

41:53.878 --> 41:56.813
of a stone that
was worth $55,000.

41:59.116 --> 42:00.049
- Really?
- Yeah.

42:00.051 --> 42:01.017
- Shit.
- Yeah, just

42:01.019 --> 42:03.553
walking it around in my pocket.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.725
Can you imagine what we could
do with that kind of money?

42:08.727 --> 42:09.792
- And there're stories
of people getting robbed

42:09.794 --> 42:10.927
all the time.

42:10.929 --> 42:10.927
- Yeah, it happens all
the time apparently,

42:10.929 --> 42:14.564
but I'm just supposed
to give up everything.

42:14.566 --> 42:16.599
Don't fight, don't run.

42:18.702 --> 42:19.702
- Jesus.

42:24.241 --> 42:25.675
Please be careful.

42:25.677 --> 42:27.810
If anything happen
to you I'd just...

42:27.812 --> 42:29.946
Maybe I could do some
body guarding for you

42:29.948 --> 42:30.947
pro Bono of course.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.148
You know just follow you around

42:32.150 --> 42:33.750
discourage anyone
getting froggy.

42:33.752 --> 42:37.687
Or I could just carry you
around in a baby Bijorn

42:37.689 --> 42:40.189
nothing like weird or anything.

42:44.562 --> 42:45.895
What's that for?

42:48.766 --> 42:50.567
- You're being nice.

42:51.835 --> 42:54.304
- I'm not sure.

42:54.306 --> 42:56.773
- You said anything I pick.

43:03.582 --> 43:05.815
- This look transitions
well from day to evening.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.079
- Oh, god, it was awful.

43:36.081 --> 43:39.682
I mean she was so happy
when she first got the part.

43:39.684 --> 43:40.883
I mean she told everybody.

43:40.885 --> 43:43.219
Of course we had this
huge going away party.

43:43.221 --> 43:44.253
- So what happened?

43:44.255 --> 43:46.389
- Well, the last day of shooting

43:46.391 --> 43:48.625
she had this giant scene, right

43:48.627 --> 43:51.394
I mean big monologue
lots of words.

43:52.663 --> 43:54.297
She couldn't get out
of the make up chair.

43:54.299 --> 43:58.001
I mean she just froze,
completely paralyzed.

43:58.003 --> 43:59.636
- That's awful.
- Yeah,

43:59.638 --> 44:02.038
and the producers were
screaming at her agent

44:02.040 --> 44:03.106
and she could hear them.

44:03.108 --> 44:04.641
I mean it was a disaster.

44:04.643 --> 44:06.643
- Do you have a
nine volt battery?

44:06.645 --> 44:07.645
- Oh, um.

44:10.314 --> 44:11.381
- Thank you.

44:12.416 --> 44:13.249
- I also have a
light in the bathroom

44:13.251 --> 44:15.218
that's too high for me.

44:15.919 --> 44:16.919
- Let's do it all.

44:17.221 --> 44:18.221
- Okay.

44:19.790 --> 44:23.026
Anyway we finally got
enough Valium in her

44:23.028 --> 44:25.795
to stumble to the set
but it was a mess,

44:25.797 --> 44:27.997
and then of course I mean

44:29.266 --> 44:32.735
when they picked up the
series they recast her part.

44:33.971 --> 44:35.672
- That must have
been tremendously difficult.

44:35.674 --> 44:37.874
- Oh, god she was devastated.

44:37.876 --> 44:41.344
Then she had to come back here,
right, and face everybody.

44:41.346 --> 44:43.112
You see I think
that's why she can't

44:43.114 --> 44:44.814
give this whole acting thing up.

44:44.816 --> 44:46.182
I mean she's gotta save face,

44:46.184 --> 44:49.852
and she's gotta prove to
herself that she can do it.

44:49.854 --> 44:52.321
Plus I don't think she
even knows what else to do.

44:52.323 --> 44:54.057
- No, I meant difficult for you

44:54.059 --> 44:57.093
seeing your kid in that
kind of pain struggling.

44:57.095 --> 44:58.361
I had to pull Alex
out of little league

44:58.363 --> 45:00.063
because it was
making me anxious.

45:00.065 --> 45:02.231
I threw up in the dug out once.

45:02.233 --> 45:04.901
Kept getting struck out,
he was a poor fielder.

45:04.903 --> 45:07.236
He did get hit by
a lot of pitches.

45:07.238 --> 45:09.739
- You don't talk about him much.

45:09.741 --> 45:10.406
- He hates me.

45:10.408 --> 45:11.841
- Oh, he does not.

45:11.843 --> 45:13.176
- Yeah, he does.

45:14.011 --> 45:15.211
- When his mother died I kind of

45:15.213 --> 45:17.380
overcompensated with
the tough love thing.

45:17.382 --> 45:19.716
My pop was a second
rate auto mechanic

45:19.718 --> 45:21.317
with a short temper.

45:22.352 --> 45:24.454
We didn't talk
about feelings much.

45:24.456 --> 45:25.855
- You're being hard on yourself.

45:25.857 --> 45:27.256
Every parent feels
things like this.

45:27.258 --> 45:29.792
You know, he knows
that you love him.

45:29.794 --> 45:31.994
- Either way he's
grown, he lived.

45:31.996 --> 45:35.331
Now I get to figure out
the rest of my life.

45:35.333 --> 45:37.734
- So what's on the agenda?

45:39.737 --> 45:41.104
- I've got plans.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.739
Small plans.

45:44.975 --> 45:46.242
- I like plans.

45:47.111 --> 45:48.111
- Good.

45:53.016 --> 45:55.151
- You know I think
Joe might move out soon.

45:55.153 --> 45:56.886
I know you're real happy
on your ma's couch and all.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.221
- Ray.

45:59.056 --> 46:01.023
- I know, I know I get excited.

46:04.328 --> 46:05.328
- It's nice.

46:06.096 --> 46:07.764
I don't mean this to be shitty,

46:07.766 --> 46:10.366
but it really seems like you've

46:12.336 --> 46:15.471
done some growing up in
the last couple months.

46:15.473 --> 46:16.473
- Thanks.

46:20.010 --> 46:22.912
You know I had this
counselor at anger management

46:22.914 --> 46:25.948
who said, "start acting like
the person you want to be

46:25.950 --> 46:28.551
"and soon you'll
become that person."

46:28.553 --> 46:30.887
But that's terrible advice.

46:30.889 --> 46:32.989
I think acting like the
person I wanted to be

46:32.991 --> 46:35.925
was what made me
such a shit head.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.095
I trapped myself
into believing that

46:39.097 --> 46:40.196
I had to be the person that the

46:40.198 --> 46:41.497
18-year old me thought was cool.

46:41.499 --> 46:44.901
But it turns out the
18-year old me was an idiot.

46:44.903 --> 46:46.202
- You were just
trying to be cool.

46:46.204 --> 46:47.804
You're an artist.

46:48.839 --> 46:50.173
- Yeah, I love
making stuff I do.

46:50.175 --> 46:52.575
But I think what I
wanted more than anything

46:52.577 --> 46:55.344
was to be different than
normal people somehow.

46:55.346 --> 46:56.946
You know to get noticed like,

46:56.948 --> 47:00.817
"ooh, isn't that what's
his name over there?"

47:01.351 --> 47:02.885
Just need to be busy.

47:03.320 --> 47:04.153
Busy's happy.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.521
- Yeah, you're right.

47:05.523 --> 47:09.025
I care about all that
stuff too it's so stupid.

47:09.860 --> 47:12.061
- Can I ask you a question?

47:13.163 --> 47:14.363
Are you still getting
those panicky things?

47:14.365 --> 47:17.433
- A lot lately I
should get some pills.

47:17.435 --> 47:18.367
- Nah, forget that.

47:18.369 --> 47:21.037
I mean I know a guy obviously.

47:22.105 --> 47:23.272
There's this thing
I've been doing

47:23.274 --> 47:24.974
when I get mad or
punchy whatever.

47:24.976 --> 47:26.309
It really helps.

47:27.110 --> 47:28.244
I made it up you wanna try it?

47:28.246 --> 47:29.445
- Is it gross?

47:30.180 --> 47:31.180
- No, shut up god.

47:31.849 --> 47:33.149
No, sit Indian style.

47:33.151 --> 47:35.051
- Not cool, paleface.

47:36.320 --> 47:39.455
- Christ sit in the style
of people from India, okay.

47:41.058 --> 47:42.859
Now close your eyes.

47:45.128 --> 47:46.929
No laughing, no laughing.

47:46.931 --> 47:47.930
This is serious.
- I'm sorry,

47:47.932 --> 47:49.332
okay, okay, okay.

47:53.103 --> 47:55.571
- First, try to be very small

47:57.641 --> 48:01.978
like a marble of energy
floating around inside your body

48:03.146 --> 48:05.948
then shrink to a speck of light.

48:06.884 --> 48:09.352
Now here's what I tell myself.

48:10.420 --> 48:12.955
You are a tiny germ
on a dirty rock

48:14.524 --> 48:17.460
spinning at a
1,000 miles an hour

48:18.161 --> 48:19.395
and orbiting a star.

48:20.464 --> 48:23.432
That star is just one
of hundreds of billions

48:23.434 --> 48:24.967
in a milky way,

48:26.036 --> 48:27.336
which itself is one of
hundreds of billions

48:27.338 --> 48:30.273
of galaxies in the
known universe.

48:32.442 --> 48:34.110
You do not matter.

48:34.678 --> 48:36.412
No one is watching.

48:37.915 --> 48:39.048
You are free.

48:43.020 --> 48:44.353
- That is the most
depressing thing

48:44.355 --> 48:46.022
I have ever heard.

48:47.090 --> 48:49.458
- No, it's great news
you're inconsequential.

48:49.460 --> 48:51.327
You can do whatever you want.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.329
Think about it in the face
of all that nothingness

48:53.331 --> 48:55.064
what is there to
be worried about?

48:55.066 --> 48:57.133
What other people think?

48:57.935 --> 48:59.502
Fear and anger are ego problems,

48:59.504 --> 49:01.170
but you, you don't not matter.

49:01.172 --> 49:03.973
No one is watching, you're free.

49:05.042 --> 49:06.509
You do not matter
no one is watching.

49:06.511 --> 49:07.643
You are free.

50:02.265 --> 50:04.467
- Why are you up so early?

50:05.202 --> 50:06.702
- I'm a working man.

50:07.537 --> 50:09.338
I work in exchange for money,

50:10.407 --> 50:11.674
that I use to procure
both goods and services.

50:11.676 --> 50:13.576
- All right services.

50:19.616 --> 50:21.617
You're such an asshole.

50:24.654 --> 50:27.490
- Listen steal
anything you like.

50:28.592 --> 50:30.092
I wouldn't eat what's
in the fridge though.

50:30.094 --> 50:30.726
It's really more
decorative than anything.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.094
- Of course, okay.

50:34.598 --> 50:35.598
- Bye.

50:45.442 --> 50:46.442
- What?

50:47.210 --> 50:48.778
- Nothing, shut up, god, bye.

51:12.569 --> 51:13.769
- Are you alive?

51:13.771 --> 51:15.604
- I'm fine that's
why I'm calling.

51:15.606 --> 51:17.473
I'm sorry I didn't come home.

51:17.475 --> 51:19.275
- You're a grown up.

51:20.177 --> 51:21.243
But it'd be nice
if you'd called.

51:21.245 --> 51:22.711
- I'm apologizing.

51:24.347 --> 51:27.149
- Would it be intruding
if I asked where you are?

51:27.151 --> 51:28.151
- Yes.

51:28.852 --> 51:30.419
But I'm at Ray's.

51:31.321 --> 51:32.321
- Uh-huh.

51:33.490 --> 51:36.492
- I don't know, mommy,
he's made lots of changes.

51:36.494 --> 51:39.595
Honestly I'm really happy
when we're together.

51:39.597 --> 51:41.130
- The only thing
I want is for you

51:41.132 --> 51:43.599
to be happy when you're alone.

51:44.367 --> 51:45.501
I wish I was.

51:46.336 --> 51:48.370
I get so sad when I'm by myself.

51:48.372 --> 51:50.139
- Me too sometimes.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.208
- The truth is that everyone

51:52.210 --> 51:54.643
and everything else
is just fleeting.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.645
It's just a blurry
landscape out the window

51:56.647 --> 51:58.447
of a speeding train.

51:59.316 --> 52:00.616
- Geez, it's not that bad is it?

52:00.618 --> 52:03.486
Can't I be on the
train with you?

52:04.254 --> 52:05.254
- Yeah.

52:06.256 --> 52:08.524
Yes of course you
have always been my

52:08.526 --> 52:10.192
traveling companion.

52:10.194 --> 52:13.729
- You remember that time when
we took the bus to Madison

52:13.731 --> 52:15.731
and I threw up on
daddy's over coat?

52:15.733 --> 52:17.900
- God, he was so
mad at me that day.

52:17.902 --> 52:20.302
I wouldn't let
him bring a flask.

52:20.304 --> 52:22.571
- You never talk about him.

52:23.607 --> 52:24.807
- I don't think
about him that much.

52:24.809 --> 52:26.775
I mean he was only in
my life for eight years

52:26.777 --> 52:30.212
and he's been gone for
three times that, wow.

52:30.214 --> 52:31.680
- That's so weird.

52:32.716 --> 52:34.650
- Kind of wish he was
around now though.

52:34.652 --> 52:36.685
Be fun to have something
to look forward to

52:36.687 --> 52:38.854
or someone to look forward with.

52:38.856 --> 52:41.624
- You have lots to
look forward to.

52:41.626 --> 52:43.626
- Yes, and so do you, sweetie.

52:43.628 --> 52:46.562
I mean, Cassie,
you are so bright.

52:48.698 --> 52:50.533
You could be anything you want.

52:50.535 --> 52:52.535
- I told you I'm going to la,

52:52.537 --> 52:54.170
and I told you I'm
up for that cop show.

52:54.172 --> 52:55.604
It could be a really big deal.

52:55.606 --> 52:57.306
I'm making it all
happen you'll see.

52:57.308 --> 52:59.742
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
listen I gotta go because

52:59.744 --> 53:01.677
my cereal's getting gloppy.

53:01.679 --> 53:02.912
Okay, I love you.

53:02.914 --> 53:04.180
- Bye.
- Bye.

53:13.490 --> 53:15.591
- Hey, Julie, Bob said
you wanted to see me.

53:15.593 --> 53:16.926
- Yeah, I have some bad news.

53:16.928 --> 53:16.926
- Shit.
- I'm sorry, ray.

53:16.928 --> 53:20.729
You're a real hard worker, but
the local's busting my balls.

53:20.731 --> 53:22.631
- I'll join the union
I tried twice already.

53:22.633 --> 53:24.200
- I'm sorry.

53:24.202 --> 53:25.401
If I need some extra hands,
I'll give you a call.

53:25.403 --> 53:26.902
But right now I don't
have anything for you.

53:26.904 --> 53:27.870
- Well, that's
just fucking great.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.872
I'll go stand outside home depo.

53:29.874 --> 53:31.473
- Good luck, ray.

53:37.247 --> 53:38.447
- Hi, morning.

53:38.882 --> 53:39.882
- Hey, morning.

53:39.884 --> 53:43.385
How was last night did
you make any progress?

53:43.387 --> 53:45.721
- I don't know
isn't your dad here?

53:45.723 --> 53:46.723
- He's out.

53:47.557 --> 53:48.891
What do you mean you don't know?

53:48.893 --> 53:51.627
- We need to find someone else?

53:52.262 --> 53:53.229
- Why?

53:53.231 --> 53:54.630
- Well, he's not going for it.

53:54.632 --> 53:56.298
- You're supposed
to convince him.

53:56.300 --> 53:57.900
- I tried.

53:58.802 --> 53:59.902
- Yeah, I bet.

53:59.904 --> 53:59.902
- What's that supposed to mean?

53:59.904 --> 54:03.239
- You're wearing the same
clothes you left in last night.

54:03.241 --> 54:04.240
- That's none of your business.

54:04.242 --> 54:05.474
- What about la?

54:05.476 --> 54:07.376
You come up with some
other career plan

54:07.378 --> 54:08.344
I don't know about?

54:08.346 --> 54:09.845
- I can't make him do it?

54:09.847 --> 54:11.847
- Yes, of course you could,

54:11.849 --> 54:14.650
but you don't want to
because you like him.

54:14.652 --> 54:16.952
- I'm sorry I have feelings
for you, Alex, I do,

54:16.954 --> 54:18.487
but ray and I have

54:18.489 --> 54:19.521
a lot of history together.
- Please, alright

54:19.523 --> 54:20.990
don't flatter yourself.

54:20.992 --> 54:23.926
- Look we can still
figure it out, right.

54:23.928 --> 54:25.661
It just can't be ray, okay.

54:25.663 --> 54:26.929
- It's not okay.

54:26.931 --> 54:29.732
What are you bringing
to this arrangement?

54:29.734 --> 54:31.033
If you want a piece of this,

54:31.035 --> 54:32.668
you're gonna have
to do something.

54:32.670 --> 54:34.270
I know that's not your thing...

54:34.272 --> 54:35.272
- fuck you.

54:36.306 --> 54:37.273
You don't know
anything about me.

54:37.275 --> 54:39.508
You know what take that back.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.983
- Couldn't he be
setting you up right now?

54:47.985 --> 54:49.852
He could just have some
dope waiting for you

54:49.854 --> 54:51.053
right outside that door.

54:51.055 --> 54:52.821
- No, no he
wouldn't do that to me.

54:52.823 --> 54:55.524
- So you say but he's
not gonna warn you

54:55.526 --> 54:56.659
if he is gonna do it, right.

54:56.661 --> 54:57.860
It's possible.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.462
- Your girl
still work at Tartuffo's?

55:00.464 --> 55:02.431
- No, she works down
at jeweler's row now.

55:02.433 --> 55:05.067
- No, shit, I'll
keep an eye out.

55:06.503 --> 55:07.436
Take care, bro.

55:07.438 --> 55:09.371
Let's get out of here.

55:11.675 --> 55:12.675
- Shit.

55:14.844 --> 55:16.845
- It's possible, right?

55:16.847 --> 55:18.047
- Technically.

55:18.748 --> 55:20.516
- So just hold on to it.

55:21.017 --> 55:22.451
Okay, you never know.

55:22.453 --> 55:23.986
But you have to be ready

55:23.988 --> 55:25.854
every time you leave.

55:27.390 --> 55:29.792
This is gonna work, Cassidy,

55:30.593 --> 55:32.928
but you gotta have faith, okay.

55:36.099 --> 55:38.767
Hey, will you meet me somewhere

55:38.769 --> 55:42.571
somewhere where you won't
see anyone you know?

55:42.573 --> 55:43.672
Where's that?

55:44.107 --> 55:45.107
- Fuck pop.

55:45.909 --> 55:47.543
Anything that's worth real money

55:47.545 --> 55:51.513
he takes to Canada through
sault Ste. Marie himself.

55:51.515 --> 55:52.915
He's got some guy in Toronto

55:52.917 --> 55:55.651
who fucking resells it in China.

55:55.653 --> 55:56.652
- No, shit.

55:56.654 --> 56:00.622
- I was told there was
opportunity for growth.

56:00.624 --> 56:03.359
I was told that this
was an organization

56:03.361 --> 56:05.694
that likes to promote
from within, you know.

56:05.696 --> 56:08.097
No, there is no organization.

56:09.366 --> 56:11.600
It's just one old ass
thief with tuna breath

56:11.602 --> 56:14.403
just getting over on reputation.

56:15.538 --> 56:17.606
It's time I start to
look out for myself.

56:17.608 --> 56:18.907
I'm not doing this when I'm 30.

56:18.909 --> 56:20.909
- Alright, let's do it.

56:21.945 --> 56:23.779
I'll give you 25% of
whatever I sell it for.

56:23.781 --> 56:24.781
- Hell no.

56:25.515 --> 56:26.815
You'll give me 50.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.818
- That's ridiculous.
- No, we aren't negotiating.

56:29.820 --> 56:32.921
- Fine 35, but you have to
wait for my go ahead, okay.

56:32.923 --> 56:34.490
We gotta make sure that
she's got enough on her

56:34.492 --> 56:35.824
to make it worth it.

56:35.826 --> 56:39.161
- Maybe I should just
rob her on my own

56:40.663 --> 56:43.499
keep the diamonds and tell
you to go fuck yourself.

56:43.501 --> 56:44.566
- You wouldn't do that.

56:44.568 --> 56:45.768
- Yeah, why not?

56:45.770 --> 56:48.670
- Because, well, for one
you would have no idea

56:48.672 --> 56:51.573
how to sell a lose diamond
without getting arrested,

56:51.575 --> 56:54.910
and, secondly, because
despite your job

56:56.012 --> 56:58.614
you're fundamental
an ethical person.

57:00.483 --> 57:02.518
- Sorry for just barging in.

57:02.520 --> 57:03.819
- Are you kidding me you
have an open invitation.

57:03.821 --> 57:05.020
I'll get you a key.

57:05.022 --> 57:06.422
- I had to get out
of the apartment.

57:06.424 --> 57:08.857
Barry is there like
all the time now.

57:08.859 --> 57:10.626
All he does is
drink warm club soda

57:10.628 --> 57:12.961
and swear at the local news.

57:13.696 --> 57:15.097
- Do you want a drink?

57:15.099 --> 57:17.599
- Yeah, I'll take
a beer if you've got one.

57:17.601 --> 57:19.701
- I think I have
a few Daisy cutters.

57:19.703 --> 57:19.701
- At least they're going
away for the weekend.

57:19.703 --> 57:23.872
It'll be nice to have the
place to myself for a few days.

57:23.874 --> 57:24.940
- Who?

57:25.575 --> 57:26.508
- Mom and Barry.

57:26.510 --> 57:28.177
He's taking her to lake Geneva.

57:28.179 --> 57:29.578
- Nice.
- Yeah.

57:29.580 --> 57:31.847
- Does that mean we
get to play house?

57:31.849 --> 57:33.549
- Oh, god, dude I cannot handle

57:33.551 --> 57:34.850
being at my mom's anymore.

57:34.852 --> 57:36.051
- Please come here.

57:36.053 --> 57:36.985
I'll leave you be.

57:36.987 --> 57:38.587
You can stay in the other room.

57:38.589 --> 57:40.055
Just give a knock when you
want some action or whatever.

57:40.057 --> 57:40.055
- We have to eat, dummy.

57:40.057 --> 57:43.826
How much money do you have
in the bank right now anyway?

57:43.828 --> 57:44.828
- Plenty.

57:50.467 --> 57:51.200
- It's the cops, pussy.

57:51.202 --> 57:52.202
Let me in.

57:59.075 --> 58:00.976
Yeah, yeah, well if
you quit, what's up.

58:00.978 --> 58:02.244
If you quit being a
big giant baby about it

58:02.246 --> 58:04.780
maybe I'll get you some too.

58:05.715 --> 58:06.648
Sure.

58:06.650 --> 58:09.952
No, but don't wear those
espadrilles alright they're gross.

58:09.954 --> 58:11.019
What's good?

58:11.021 --> 58:13.188
Hey, sorry, so I
can't really hang out.

58:13.190 --> 58:14.156
I just came to grab...

58:14.158 --> 58:15.824
- this is Cassidy.

58:16.726 --> 58:18.660
Cassidy, this is
my friend Cosby.

58:18.962 --> 58:19.962
- Hi.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.499
- He's Irish.

58:23.800 --> 58:24.800
- Hi.

58:25.768 --> 58:27.169
Nice to meet you.

58:28.238 --> 58:29.805
Sorry, fucking around.

58:29.807 --> 58:32.608
So I just came to
pick up my stuff.

58:32.610 --> 58:33.575
- The tools.

58:33.577 --> 58:35.043
- Yeah, the tools.

58:35.778 --> 58:36.778
- Yeah, one second.

58:36.780 --> 58:38.914
- I'm putting up a spice rack.

58:38.916 --> 58:40.983
So just probably
the screw driver

58:40.985 --> 58:43.652
and the shears and other shit.

58:47.657 --> 58:50.259
You know what my friend Stephon

58:51.528 --> 58:52.694
he was just saying
that he was actually

58:52.696 --> 58:53.896
thinking of doing some
remodeling as well

58:53.898 --> 58:55.130
so do you think that
you have any tools

58:55.132 --> 58:56.632
he could borrow.
- I cannot believe this.

58:56.634 --> 58:57.833
I am an idiot.

58:58.535 --> 59:00.002
So much for the new you.

59:01.070 --> 59:03.038
- Cassidy it's not
what it looks like.

59:03.040 --> 59:04.040
Shit.

59:04.707 --> 59:05.774
I got fired.

59:06.209 --> 59:07.209
I'm sorry.

59:07.243 --> 59:08.677
You want money.

59:08.679 --> 59:09.945
You want to go to la I'm
trying to figure it out.

59:09.947 --> 59:11.747
I'm not sitting around
feeling sorry for myself

59:11.749 --> 59:13.549
pretending some lottery
ticket's about to come in.

59:13.551 --> 59:14.616
- I'm sorry.

59:14.618 --> 59:17.052
I don't share your
protestant work ethic.

59:17.054 --> 59:20.556
Selling Adderall to tweakers
is really inspirational.

59:20.558 --> 59:21.223
- Cass, I didn't mean...

59:21.225 --> 59:23.058
- I'll see you later.

59:27.597 --> 59:28.330
- Yikes.

59:28.332 --> 59:31.166
Hey, do you really have
that Adderall though?

59:31.168 --> 59:34.636
'Cause the Ritalin
gave me the squirts.

59:42.979 --> 59:44.746
- Hey, honey how you doing?

59:44.748 --> 59:46.682
- I thought you were
going to lake Geneva?

59:46.684 --> 59:49.351
- Just finishing
a couple of things.

59:49.353 --> 59:52.287
- So what do you
got for me today?

59:53.156 --> 59:54.122
- I got one just
give me a minute

59:54.124 --> 59:56.058
to get the package together.

01:00:03.066 --> 01:00:05.734
- Is this is the
silent treatment?

01:00:05.736 --> 01:00:07.035
- Just working.

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:11.740
- Westermann.

01:00:11.742 --> 01:00:12.708
- Westermann?

01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:13.842
- Where's that?

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.377
- On Harrison just
this side of the river.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:16.979
Hustle they're expecting you.

01:00:16.981 --> 01:00:17.980
I gotta get going.

01:00:17.982 --> 01:00:20.649
Alex, do not forget the alarm.

01:00:26.756 --> 01:00:28.991
- What do you want from me?

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.826
- Nothing, okay.

01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:32.160
Nothing.

01:00:32.895 --> 01:00:34.129
There are people who
actually do shit,

01:00:34.131 --> 01:00:37.232
and there are people
who just talk shit.

01:00:38.034 --> 01:00:40.102
Go make your deliver, please.

01:00:43.773 --> 01:00:44.773
Hello.

01:00:45.341 --> 01:00:47.676
Vikram, hey, what
are you looking for?

01:00:47.678 --> 01:00:51.680
Three quarter caret let
me check the inventory.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.733
- This is Cassidy.

01:01:11.735 --> 01:01:12.401
- Cassidy, it's Bettina.

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:12.401
- Hi, Bettina.

01:01:12.403 --> 01:01:16.338
- Get over to Sullivan
callback for the cop show.

01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:19.207
- Right now I haven't
even seen the sides yet.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.910
- Arlene Thompson
is only in town for one day.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:24.112
- I'm kind of in the
middle of something.

01:01:24.114 --> 01:01:25.313
Can they see me this afternoon?

01:01:25.315 --> 01:01:26.248
- You can go right now,

01:01:26.250 --> 01:01:27.449
or I can send someone else.

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:28.950
- Yeah, of course I'm listening.

01:01:28.952 --> 01:01:31.987
Okay, okay I'm on
my way thank you.

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.069
- Thom and
Arlene, from the network

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:22.938
this is Cassidy Harper.

01:02:22.940 --> 01:02:25.006
- Hi, thank you
for having me back.

01:02:25.008 --> 01:02:27.142
I'm really excited
about the part.

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:27.142
The script is great.

01:02:27.144 --> 01:02:31.947
- Okay, Cassidy, slate
whenever you're ready.

01:02:33.916 --> 01:02:36.084
- Hi, I'm Cassidy Harper.

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:38.420
- So you're the new detective?

01:02:38.422 --> 01:02:39.921
- Yeah, name's Donahue.

01:02:39.923 --> 01:02:41.790
- Says here
your name's McDougal.

01:02:41.792 --> 01:02:42.791
- That's right.

01:02:42.793 --> 01:02:44.025
- So which one is it?

01:02:44.027 --> 01:02:45.127
- Well, it's both.

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:46.228
Donahue McDougal.

01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:48.430
- Oh, that's some name.

01:02:48.432 --> 01:02:49.898
Read your file.

01:02:50.533 --> 01:02:52.334
- Sorry, an Irish cop, right?

01:02:53.536 --> 01:02:56.304
- I read your
file 10 years in Narco.

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:58.006
- Yeah, there
isn't a junky on the Westside

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.842
that I don't know on
a first name basis.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:02.811
- Well, let's go
meet your new partner.

01:03:02.813 --> 01:03:03.879
- Copy that.

01:03:05.081 --> 01:03:06.448
- Thanks, Cassidy.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.450
Nice job.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.988
- Seriously nothing
from you guys?

01:03:15.191 --> 01:03:16.558
Is that what you had in mind,

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.928
or were you I don't know
thinking of something else?

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:21.329
- That was fine.

01:03:21.331 --> 01:03:23.131
- I'm very sorry
to interrupt your important

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:24.566
conversation over there.
- Cassidy.

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:27.502
- Honestly, honey,
I think we are

01:03:28.337 --> 01:03:29.271
looking for a different type.

01:03:29.273 --> 01:03:31.072
- Like 26, big tits, veneers.

01:03:31.074 --> 01:03:32.541
- Cassidy - good
choice, brave choice.

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:35.010
Let me guess is the
partner a black guy

01:03:35.012 --> 01:03:36.878
about a retire or
a Saint Bernard.

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.547
- Okay, I'm so sorry.

01:03:39.816 --> 01:03:41.082
- Should we call security?

01:03:41.084 --> 01:03:42.284
She's too old.

01:03:43.119 --> 01:03:44.119
- She's fine she's just

01:03:44.121 --> 01:03:46.822
- fuck you.

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:49.324
- Whoa, that's a first.

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:12.214
- Hi, Bettina.

01:04:13.282 --> 01:04:14.482
- What the fuck
were you thinking?

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:17.052
That was a network
television show.

01:04:17.054 --> 01:04:17.986
- I know I was out of line,

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.321
but they were really rude to me.

01:04:19.323 --> 01:04:22.023
- Who are you the
queen of Sheba?

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:24.926
You know what I
think we're done.

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:26.862
- What are you saying?

01:04:26.864 --> 01:04:28.029
- I mean it we're through.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.865
- Come on, Bettina,
this is my career.

01:04:29.867 --> 01:04:32.400
- Oh, honey, be
honest with yourself

01:04:32.402 --> 01:04:35.237
what career are
you talking about?

01:04:35.239 --> 01:04:36.271
Other than the pilot

01:04:36.273 --> 01:04:38.306
which we know how that went

01:04:38.308 --> 01:04:40.141
you have booked an industrial

01:04:40.143 --> 01:04:43.278
and a radio commercial
in five years.

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.881
I mean you gave it a shot.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:45.881
It didn't happen.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:49.317
It's time to move on and do
something else with your life.

01:04:49.319 --> 01:04:51.553
- No, please, please
you are over reacting.

01:04:51.555 --> 01:04:54.556
I will go back there right
now, and I will apologize.

01:04:54.558 --> 01:04:56.558
- Tell them I'll be
there in a minute.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.560
I'm sorry I've gotta take this.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:00.295
It's time to move on, honey.

01:05:00.297 --> 01:05:01.663
Good luck to you.

01:05:17.381 --> 01:05:18.513
- Sorry I had to make a stop.

01:05:18.515 --> 01:05:20.448
I'm like five minutes away.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:22.584
I'm almost there
I'll explain later.

01:05:22.586 --> 01:05:23.685
Fuck you too.

01:05:35.064 --> 01:05:37.032
- Give it here.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:40.702
Got it I got it.

01:05:42.939 --> 01:05:44.606
- Stay right fucking
there and count to 50.

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:46.041
If I see you look,
I'm gonna come back

01:05:46.043 --> 01:05:48.510
and put a bullet in your head.

01:05:56.018 --> 01:05:57.419
- One,

01:05:58.654 --> 01:05:59.654
two,

01:06:00.656 --> 01:06:01.656
three,

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.125
four,

01:06:05.194 --> 01:06:06.194
five,

01:06:07.497 --> 01:06:08.497
six.

01:06:09.565 --> 01:06:11.166
Somebody help me.

01:06:13.402 --> 01:06:14.402
Help.

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:18.606
Help me.

01:06:23.646 --> 01:06:25.313
- We'll just take
some time maybe

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:28.116
something will come back to you.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:29.517
- Hey, you okay?

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.387
- Ms. Harper, here's my card.

01:06:32.389 --> 01:06:34.656
Just call me if you can
think of anything useful.

01:06:34.658 --> 01:06:37.425
Let's catch these
assholes, okay.

01:06:37.427 --> 01:06:38.593
Feel better.

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:41.396
- Thank you for
being so nice to me.

01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:43.365
- Thank you, officer.

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:48.136
- So what happened?

01:06:48.771 --> 01:06:50.138
- These two guys beat me up

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:51.206
ripped my pocket off.

01:06:51.208 --> 01:06:53.208
I didn't have a chance.

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:54.542
- Dammit.

01:06:54.544 --> 01:06:56.778
You were supposed to be ready.

01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:58.013
- They want me to
stay overnight.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:07:00.482
They think I have a concussion.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.283
- Is your mom coming back?

01:07:02.285 --> 01:07:03.418
- She's not answering her phone.

01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:05.620
- Yeah, neither is my dad.

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:07.655
Look I have to ask you.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:09.324
Do you think the
guys were with ray?

01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:10.326
- No.

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:12.027
He wouldn't let anyone hurt me?

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:12.694
- How do you know for sure?

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:13.762
Were they white?

01:07:13.764 --> 01:07:15.030
Were they black?

01:07:15.032 --> 01:07:16.564
Someone knew, right?

01:07:16.566 --> 01:07:18.266
Someone knew what
you were carrying.

01:07:18.268 --> 01:07:21.136
- I had a plastic
bag over my head.

01:07:21.138 --> 01:07:22.437
I couldn't see anything.

01:07:22.439 --> 01:07:24.372
What do you want from me?

01:07:24.374 --> 01:07:25.640
- Everything okay in here?

01:07:25.642 --> 01:07:27.308
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:30.311
I'll keep trying your mom, okay?

01:07:31.313 --> 01:07:34.249
- Can I call somebody
for you sweetie?

01:07:35.251 --> 01:07:35.817
- Alright now I wanna
see some bodies.

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:36.819
Let's go.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:40.789
Higher.

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.323
There it is.

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:44.592
Get them legs together.

01:07:44.594 --> 01:07:46.628
Get them legs together.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:51.733
Good, good.

01:07:52.268 --> 01:07:53.268
Again.

01:08:00.576 --> 01:08:02.143
What are you doing here?

01:08:02.145 --> 01:08:03.344
How'd you find me?

01:08:03.346 --> 01:08:04.345
- I have an Internet connection.

01:08:04.347 --> 01:08:06.281
You're not in the CIA.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.348
Now tell me you
have my diamonds.

01:08:07.350 --> 01:08:11.619
- Yeah, Alex, I don't have
time for this right now, okay.

01:08:11.621 --> 01:08:13.288
- Well, make time.

01:08:14.557 --> 01:08:16.491
- Do you think you can
just come up in my house

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:19.359
and start barking
orders, do you?

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:22.729
Boy, I have 20 third
graders waiting in a gym

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:24.232
for me to teach them karate,

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:26.568
and any one of them
can beat your ass.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:27.702
That's right.

01:08:28.504 --> 01:08:30.505
Now imagine what I could do?

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.274
- Just tell me you have
my diamonds or not?

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:39.279
- Alex, you have until tomorrow
to get pop's money, okay?

01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:43.818
What is this?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:46.187
You wanna be a gangsta?

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:49.390
'Cause you 'bout to find out

01:08:49.392 --> 01:08:51.826
what real gangsta
shit looks like.

01:09:06.408 --> 01:09:08.542
- Cassidy, Cassidy.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:12.613
Oh, shit.

01:09:13.616 --> 01:09:15.283
- Visiting hours are over.

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:16.684
You can't go down there.

01:09:16.685 --> 01:09:18.286
- I'm looking for
Cassidy Harper.

01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:19.154
- And you are?

01:09:19.156 --> 01:09:19.888
- Her husband.

01:09:19.890 --> 01:09:21.256
- Okay, well, she's not married.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:22.657
It's family only and
visiting hours are over.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:23.625
- I'm her brother then.
- No, sir

01:09:23.627 --> 01:09:24.492
people are sleeping.

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:25.560
It's family only.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:26.461
- Cassidy
- family only, man.

01:09:26.462 --> 01:09:27.462
- Cassidy.

01:09:28.229 --> 01:09:29.796
Oh, Jesus Christ that's awful.

01:09:29.799 --> 01:09:30.732
Cassidy.

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:30.732
- Family only
you can't go down there.

01:09:30.734 --> 01:09:33.501
- Please, sir, fuck off.

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:34.368
Cassidy.

01:09:34.371 --> 01:09:35.371
- I'm here.

01:09:35.804 --> 01:09:36.904
I got beat up.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:39.841
- Fuck.

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:41.643
Are you okay, your arm?

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:42.777
- I'm okay.

01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.345
Broken wrist,
maybe cracked ribs,

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:45.380
this thing on my head.

01:09:45.381 --> 01:09:46.413
What time is it?

01:09:46.416 --> 01:09:47.749
I don't know 9:30.

01:09:47.751 --> 01:09:48.750
Tell me what happened.

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:49.917
- That means two
and a half hours

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:52.587
till my next pill
that is some bullshit.

01:09:52.589 --> 01:09:55.790
- Easy, easy, easy
lie down, lie down.

01:09:56.625 --> 01:09:58.726
Can you remember what happened?

01:09:58.728 --> 01:10:00.862
- Yeah, two stupid boys
pushed me into the alley

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:01.863
and ripped my pants.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.598
I love those pants.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:05.700
- Okay, it's okay.

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:07.569
What do you need?

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:08.836
Ice?

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.672
An extra blanket or something?

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.807
- Look at us we're twins?

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:21.216
God, who's gonna
take care of us, huh?

01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:22.483
We're all broken up.

01:10:22.485 --> 01:10:23.818
- I will you just relax, okay.

01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.752
I'll take care of everything.

01:10:24.754 --> 01:10:27.288
- No, no we need a grown up.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:30.758
I'm sorry about before.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.893
Are you mad at me?

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:34.963
- No, of course I'm
not mad, stupid.

01:10:37.266 --> 01:10:38.399
- I'm tired.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:39.968
- Close your eyes.

01:10:40.603 --> 01:10:41.603
Close your eyes.

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.973
- Couple of broken ups.

01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.310
- Okay, visiting hours are over.

01:10:49.312 --> 01:10:51.312
You can come back tomorrow.

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.634
- Good morning, sunshine.

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.470
How you feeling?

01:11:49.905 --> 01:11:50.905
- Dreadful.

01:11:51.407 --> 01:11:53.308
What time did you get in?

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:55.410
- Couple of hours ago.

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.779
I'm sorry, baby, I didn't
even check my phone

01:11:57.781 --> 01:11:58.846
until almost midnight.

01:11:58.848 --> 01:11:59.714
- You didn't need to come.

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:00.716
I'm fine.

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.418
- Right, I'm gonna be
gettin' hot stone massages

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.354
while you're here
in the hospital.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:08.656
How's the arm?

01:12:09.058 --> 01:12:09.924
- It hurts.

01:12:09.926 --> 01:12:13.628
- Want me to go out there
and do the Shirley MacLaine?

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:17.065
- Yes, I will pay you
five bucks, please.

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.068
- Barry's beside himself.

01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:24.472
He thinks he's responsible
which told him is nuts.

01:12:25.607 --> 01:12:25.606
He wants you to know that

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:29.911
of course their insurance is
gonna take care of everything.

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:33.348
He said he'd pay you until you
get back on your feet again.

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.016
- That's nice of him.

01:12:35.751 --> 01:12:36.918
- He's a good man.

01:12:39.822 --> 01:12:42.757
In fact I have
some exciting news.

01:12:46.028 --> 01:12:48.496
So Barry last night
says to me that he is

01:12:48.498 --> 01:12:50.031
really ready to retire,

01:12:50.033 --> 01:12:51.866
and he wants to go down to

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:54.669
fort Meyers as soon as possible.

01:12:55.637 --> 01:12:57.972
He's asked me to go with him.

01:12:57.974 --> 01:12:59.707
- What did you say?

01:13:00.509 --> 01:13:02.677
- What do you mean I said yes.

01:13:03.512 --> 01:13:05.646
- Just like that you're gonna

01:13:05.648 --> 01:13:08.416
spend your golden
years with Barry?

01:13:08.418 --> 01:13:09.951
- I am gonna go to
Florida with Barry,

01:13:09.953 --> 01:13:12.754
and I'm gonna make a real
life for myself, yes.

01:13:12.756 --> 01:13:14.422
- Do you love him?

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.558
- I think I could.

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.461
- So you're settling?

01:13:21.530 --> 01:13:23.865
- You are too old
to be so naive.

01:13:24.566 --> 01:13:25.733
It's all settling.

01:13:26.702 --> 01:13:28.903
There are no rich princes.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:33.441
Nobody ever becomes an
astronaut or a ballerina.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:36.644
I mean listen to me
for once, please.

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:38.913
All you have to
do is you have to

01:13:38.915 --> 01:13:41.416
find some way to be
useful and maybe loved

01:13:41.418 --> 01:13:42.950
and find somebody
that maybe you can

01:13:42.952 --> 01:13:46.654
share some laughs with
that's all there is.

01:13:47.956 --> 01:13:52.059
Cassidy, what's so terrible
about having a regular life?

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:57.532
I'm gonna go down to Florida

01:13:58.167 --> 01:13:59.667
and I am going to sit in the sun

01:13:59.669 --> 01:14:02.170
until I look like an old shoe,

01:14:03.205 --> 01:14:05.673
and you're gonna
see how happy I am.

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:07.642
It's gonna be okay.

01:14:09.077 --> 01:14:10.445
- We never let a runner
go out on the street

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:12.079
with that kind of inventory.

01:14:12.081 --> 01:14:13.548
- I'm supposed to
hire an armored car

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:14.715
for three stones?

01:14:14.717 --> 01:14:17.919
- When they're worth
$482,000 you are.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.489
They're never gonna pay
us you know that, right?

01:14:21.491 --> 01:14:23.458
- They have to pay
us it was a robbery.

01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:25.593
She got beat up there's a
police report and a witness.

01:14:25.595 --> 01:14:28.463
We're insured on courier
transactions up to a half million.

01:14:28.465 --> 01:14:30.131
- It's fishy as fuck.

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:33.935
- The hell with it I don't care.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.937
- Excuse me.

01:14:35.939 --> 01:14:38.206
- I'm retiring I'm moving
to fort Meyers with Valerie.

01:14:38.208 --> 01:14:39.140
- You're kidding.

01:14:39.142 --> 01:14:40.575
- This is as good a time as any.

01:14:40.577 --> 01:14:41.976
If there's a business
left, it's all yours.

01:14:41.978 --> 01:14:43.077
I wash my hands.

01:14:43.079 --> 01:14:45.046
- You can afford to retire?

01:14:45.048 --> 01:14:46.214
- I do not need much.

01:14:46.216 --> 01:14:47.815
I found a little place.

01:14:47.817 --> 01:14:49.584
- If the insurance company
decides not to pay off?

01:14:49.586 --> 01:14:53.621
- Then you're gonna need
a job, but hello Florida.

01:14:53.623 --> 01:14:55.690
- Maybe I should just stay home.

01:14:55.692 --> 01:14:56.692
- Come on.

01:14:57.259 --> 01:14:58.893
It's Judy's 60th birthday.

01:14:58.895 --> 01:15:00.895
She's gonna be crushed if
you don't go to her party.

01:15:00.897 --> 01:15:02.196
Look it is a broken wrist.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:04.999
Ray is perfectly capable
of keeping an eye on me.

01:15:06.169 --> 01:15:08.803
- Through three
inches of plexiglass.

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:09.805
Coming.

01:15:12.241 --> 01:15:13.708
Hello, Raymond.

01:15:14.243 --> 01:15:15.176
- Hello, Ms. Harper.

01:15:15.178 --> 01:15:16.644
- No, call me Valerie.

01:15:16.646 --> 01:15:18.079
- Yes, mom, you can me ray.

01:15:18.081 --> 01:15:19.680
It's actually my whole name ray

01:15:19.682 --> 01:15:21.082
no middle name either.

01:15:21.084 --> 01:15:23.918
I think my parents could
only afford a few letters.

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:24.986
- How you feeling, champ?

01:15:24.988 --> 01:15:27.054
- Like smashed assholes.

01:15:28.056 --> 01:15:29.857
- That's a powerful
image, honey.

01:15:29.859 --> 01:15:33.861
Okay, ray, thank you so
much for being on duty.

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.898
She gets her next pill at 7:30.

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:38.533
She does.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.601
- Happy to be of service.

01:15:40.603 --> 01:15:42.803
- Alright I won't be late.

01:15:43.872 --> 01:15:43.871
- I'll say hi to
Judy for you, bye.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:48.843
- Bye, mommy, make sure
somebody walks you to the taxi.

01:15:48.845 --> 01:15:50.778
- Okay, bye.

01:15:54.049 --> 01:15:56.717
- Go lie down I'm on the case.

01:15:57.686 --> 01:16:00.788
- Hold on what
happened to your cast?

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.323
It's not time yet.

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:04.091
- I'm fine only one
patient at a time.

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:05.159
- Are you okay?

01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:07.295
It's so scrawny and pale.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:10.031
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:32.853
- Hi.

01:16:35.857 --> 01:16:36.857
Right now?

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.663
Okay, yeah, calm down shit.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.268
Okay, yes, yes I will come.

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.870
I'm on my way alright bye.

01:16:58.113 --> 01:17:00.982
Hey, what's the
deal are you okay?

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:02.817
- I'm fine.

01:17:03.619 --> 01:17:04.652
- You sounded pretty upset.

01:17:04.654 --> 01:17:06.854
- Well, I've got problems.

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.024
- Well, tell me what's going on?

01:17:10.026 --> 01:17:10.891
- You remember the rum?

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:10.891
- Yeah.

01:17:10.893 --> 01:17:13.761
- Well, the guys that I
borrowed that money from

01:17:13.763 --> 01:17:15.696
are coming to collect.

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:18.132
- I don't get it you
need me to be a witness

01:17:18.134 --> 01:17:20.901
or something when you
give them the money?

01:17:20.903 --> 01:17:23.037
- I don't have the money.

01:17:24.306 --> 01:17:28.709
I need you to tell me if
they're the ones who jacked you.

01:17:29.811 --> 01:17:30.745
- Hold up.

01:17:30.747 --> 01:17:35.049
I got put in the hospital
over some money you borrowed,

01:17:35.051 --> 01:17:37.952
and now you're gonna put
me in middle of it again.

01:17:37.954 --> 01:17:39.654
- I'm almost positive
that's not what happened.

01:17:39.656 --> 01:17:41.656
- I didn't see them you
selfish motherfucker.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.991
I had a fucking grocery
bag over my face.

01:17:43.993 --> 01:17:45.192
- Yeah, but you
might be able to tell me

01:17:45.194 --> 01:17:47.328
if it could be them
just based on size

01:17:47.330 --> 01:17:48.362
or voices or whatever.

01:17:48.364 --> 01:17:49.864
- I am leaving.

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.133
- Look they're gonna
be here any minute.

01:17:52.135 --> 01:17:53.334
You wanna run into
them in the hallway.

01:17:53.336 --> 01:17:55.136
- I cannot believe you
did this to me, Alex.

01:17:55.138 --> 01:17:58.072
- Look, this could
be it, Cassidy.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:00.741
I might be able to get our
money, and it could be a lot

01:18:00.743 --> 01:18:03.711
like way more than
what we thought.

01:18:04.346 --> 01:18:05.813
You're an actress, right?

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:06.847
Put your game face on.

01:18:06.849 --> 01:18:08.783
- You are an ass wipe.

01:18:09.384 --> 01:18:10.985
- We need a signal.

01:18:10.987 --> 01:18:14.689
If you think it's them, then
cross your arms like this.

01:18:14.691 --> 01:18:15.956
- Where do you get this shit?

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:19.960
- Okay, be cool, and
get them to talk.

01:18:19.962 --> 01:18:22.463
Okay, get them to talk, so
we can hear their voices.

01:18:22.465 --> 01:18:24.165
We need to be sure.

01:18:24.933 --> 01:18:26.133
Okay, come on.

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:37.912
- Who's this?

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.847
- Cassidy.

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:43.451
- I see, Cassidy, could
you excuse us please?

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.786
- No, I don't think so.

01:18:46.254 --> 01:18:47.321
Hello.
- Hey.

01:18:49.458 --> 01:18:51.292
- I'm Cassidy what's your name?

01:18:51.294 --> 01:18:52.294
- Malik.

01:18:52.961 --> 01:18:54.095
- Malik, where you from.

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:54.095
- Atlanta.

01:18:54.097 --> 01:18:58.933
- I got the worst case
of food poisoning there.

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:01.001
What about you what's your name?

01:19:01.003 --> 01:19:02.369
- Quincy and I'm from
Delaware pretty lady.

01:19:02.371 --> 01:19:04.271
- I don't have your money.

01:19:04.273 --> 01:19:05.840
- Then why am I here then?

01:19:05.842 --> 01:19:07.975
- He is really an enigma.

01:19:11.747 --> 01:19:12.947
- I'm not giving you a nickel

01:19:12.949 --> 01:19:14.882
until you give me
my goddamn stones.

01:19:14.884 --> 01:19:16.784
- I already explained I
don't have anything for you.

01:19:16.786 --> 01:19:18.152
- Okay, quit fucking around.

01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:19.854
You think I'm some
kind of trick.

01:19:19.856 --> 01:19:21.055
You can just run game on me.

01:19:21.057 --> 01:19:23.090
- Alex, it is not them.

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.161
- Are you sure?
- Wait not who?

01:19:28.430 --> 01:19:30.498
- What the fuck
is going on here?

01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:33.501
- Dad, take your friend
and get out of here now.

01:19:33.503 --> 01:19:35.269
- I have business
to take care of.

01:19:35.271 --> 01:19:36.504
Cassidy, what are
you doing here?

01:19:36.506 --> 01:19:38.439
How's your arm, honey,
you should be relaxing.

01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:39.406
Take her home, Alex.

01:19:39.408 --> 01:19:42.076
- I'm okay just a little sore.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.378
- Who are these people?

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:46.914
- This is Quincy and Malik,

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:51.519
and I don't know who
this handsome devil is.

01:19:52.821 --> 01:19:54.288
- He works for me.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:58.425
- Sorry pop I didn't
know you were gonna be here.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:19:59.960
- Wait a second.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:02.163
Lil pop is white.

01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:03.798
- You're funny.

01:20:04.866 --> 01:20:07.001
Anthony didn't tell
me you were funny.

01:20:07.003 --> 01:20:08.235
- What are you doing
with my father?

01:20:08.237 --> 01:20:10.204
He has nothing to do with this.

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:12.072
- What are you talking about?

01:20:12.074 --> 01:20:14.475
- Anthony makes
collections for me.

01:20:14.477 --> 01:20:17.211
- You borrowed money
from a gangster?

01:20:17.213 --> 01:20:18.078
- Excuse me.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:19.046
- No offense.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:20.514
Why didn't you come to me?

01:20:20.516 --> 01:20:22.082
- I have a better question.

01:20:22.084 --> 01:20:23.484
What are you doing
showing up here with him

01:20:23.486 --> 01:20:26.487
in the middle of
the goddamn night?

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:31.158
- Business.

01:20:38.834 --> 01:20:40.835
- Here hold on to that.

01:20:42.971 --> 01:20:45.039
What happen to your arm?

01:20:46.007 --> 01:20:47.441
- Broke my wrist.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:49.844
- You're the Schlepper.

01:20:49.846 --> 01:20:52.546
Those idiot Mexicans
beat you up?

01:20:53.181 --> 01:20:54.181
- Excuse me.

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:56.951
- Get her out of here.

01:20:56.953 --> 01:20:58.485
I can't have her talking to
her mother about my business.

01:20:58.487 --> 01:21:00.988
- What kind of business
do you with that guy?

01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:04.391
- Has it ever occurred to you
that I know what I'm doing?

01:21:04.393 --> 01:21:06.260
- What's going on right now?

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:07.494
What's in the envelope?

01:21:07.496 --> 01:21:09.063
- It's like you've
learned nothing from me.

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:09.930
Keep your mouth shut.

01:21:09.932 --> 01:21:11.465
Say you understand?

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:13.868
- I don't understand at all.

01:21:13.870 --> 01:21:15.903
- Sweetheart, it'll
all be over soon.

01:21:15.905 --> 01:21:17.171
Let daddy work.

01:21:21.009 --> 01:21:22.276
- We're gonna settle
this right now.

01:21:22.278 --> 01:21:23.344
What does he owe you?

01:21:23.346 --> 01:21:24.346
- 36.

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.280
- How much of that is juice.

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:27.481
- It's about half.

01:21:27.483 --> 01:21:28.482
- You're taking
my kid for a ride?

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.417
- He's a grown up it's business.

01:21:30.419 --> 01:21:32.620
- Call it 22,
add it to your end.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.154
- You set me up.

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:37.391
You had some guys beat me up

01:21:38.126 --> 01:21:39.660
and steal the stones?

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:43.097
- I'm sorry, honey, please
don't tell your mom.

01:21:43.099 --> 01:21:44.164
They went way overboard,

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:45.399
but it had to look real.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:47.167
There's gonna be plenty
of money for everybody.

01:21:47.169 --> 01:21:48.569
- Did you know about this?

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:50.237
- What do you think?

01:21:50.239 --> 01:21:51.605
- I think maybe I
should call the cops

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.173
and report an insurance
fraud that's what

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:54.642
I fucking think.
- Don't do that.

01:21:54.644 --> 01:21:56.043
No, no, put that away.

01:21:56.045 --> 01:21:58.045
- Yeah, pop, pop.
- Arty, arty.

01:21:58.047 --> 01:21:59.213
- Okay, okay.

01:22:00.048 --> 01:22:01.181
- You're annoying me now.

01:22:01.183 --> 01:22:02.116
- No one's going
to the cops, okay.

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:03.384
Everybody just stay calm.

01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:04.585
- You setting me up, Barry.

01:22:04.587 --> 01:22:05.953
Don't insult me.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:06.921
You're giving me
$.60 on the dollar.

01:22:06.923 --> 01:22:08.455
Take the stones and go.

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:11.492
- I'm gonna take the
stones, and I'm gonna go.

01:22:11.494 --> 01:22:12.660
- Okay, please don't hurt me.

01:22:12.662 --> 01:22:13.527
Please don't hurt me.

01:22:13.529 --> 01:22:15.396
Please don't hurt me.

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.998
- Come on.

01:22:20.201 --> 01:22:21.502
- Aren't you
forgetting something?

01:22:21.504 --> 01:22:23.003
- I don't think so.

01:22:23.005 --> 01:22:26.006
Anthony, am I
forgetting something?

01:22:27.075 --> 01:22:28.676
- I don't know, pop.

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:32.012
- Arty, we've been
doing this 30 years.

01:22:32.014 --> 01:22:35.015
I've always been
straight with you.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:39.954
- In the end you gotta
take people at their word

01:22:39.956 --> 01:22:41.622
even though it doesn't work.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:43.157
I knew it.

01:22:43.159 --> 01:22:46.026
- Shit, god dammit.
- Oh, my god.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:50.230
- Who's this asshole.

01:22:50.232 --> 01:22:51.365
- He's my boyfriend.

01:22:53.169 --> 01:22:54.169
Oh, my god.

01:22:55.003 --> 01:22:56.036
- I'm calling an ambulance.

01:22:56.038 --> 01:22:57.237
- Put the phone down.

01:22:57.239 --> 01:22:58.205
- Okay.
- What you're gonna

01:22:58.207 --> 01:22:59.606
shoot everybody start with me.

01:23:00.543 --> 01:23:01.442
- Pop, we need to go now.

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:03.043
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:03.045 --> 01:23:05.179
- I need an ambulance to
5 south Wabash 10th floor

01:23:05.181 --> 01:23:06.380
a man's been shot.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:08.415
- Arty, you've always
been a stand up guy.

01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:10.684
Leave me that bag of money.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.406
- Your kid's even

01:23:13.521 --> 01:23:14.755
anybody else who wants
to keep waking up

01:23:14.757 --> 01:23:18.158
in the morning better
keep their mouth shut.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:26.400
- What the fuck have I done?

01:23:27.235 --> 01:23:29.403
- Ray, what are you doing here?

01:23:29.405 --> 01:23:31.005
- I woke up and you were gone.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.573
I thought you might
be meeting him.

01:23:32.575 --> 01:23:34.041
I didn't know this was

01:23:34.043 --> 01:23:35.542
whatever the fuck this was.

01:23:35.544 --> 01:23:38.579
- It's about the robbery.

01:23:38.581 --> 01:23:40.280
- He set you up.

01:23:40.282 --> 01:23:41.415
- You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:43.317
- That's not true, ray.

01:23:43.319 --> 01:23:44.685
- You think we're
fucking stupid.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:46.253
Think we're some fucking idiots

01:23:46.255 --> 01:23:47.688
who'll believe whatever
shitty lie you come up with.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.089
You set her up.

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.492
- Hey, asshole, we
were setting you up.

01:23:51.494 --> 01:23:55.329
Yeah, me and Cassidy we were
gonna pin you for the robbery,

01:23:55.331 --> 01:23:56.764
and then we were
gonna keep the stones

01:23:56.766 --> 01:23:59.299
and we were gonna
split the profit.

01:23:59.301 --> 01:24:00.367
What do you think about that?

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:02.036
- You were gonna steal from me?

01:24:02.038 --> 01:24:03.103
- Cass.

01:24:03.105 --> 01:24:04.304
- It wasn't like that, ray.

01:24:04.306 --> 01:24:06.073
- What was it like?

01:24:06.075 --> 01:24:07.274
- Anybody in here have a weapon?

01:24:07.276 --> 01:24:08.475
- No.
- I wish.

01:24:09.711 --> 01:24:12.646
Alright we're clear.

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.115
What happened here?

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:16.316
- We were working late,

01:24:16.318 --> 01:24:18.552
and these two Columbian
guys came in with guns

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:21.789
and Cassidy's boyfriend
surprised them.

01:24:22.624 --> 01:24:24.191
They shot him and they took off.

01:24:24.193 --> 01:24:25.492
- How long ago?

01:24:25.494 --> 01:24:26.660
- 10 minutes.

01:24:27.462 --> 01:24:28.562
- You get a look at these guys?

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.465
- Yeah, black
sweatshirts with hoods.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.801
Red bandanna on one of them.

01:24:33.803 --> 01:24:35.402
The other one had some
kind of wrestling mask.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:38.138
It was blue with yellow
lightening bolts.

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:40.140
- How do you know
they were Columbian?

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:41.475
- They were speaking Spanish.

01:24:41.477 --> 01:24:42.342
- Raciest.

01:24:42.344 --> 01:24:43.310
He's a raciest, officer.

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:44.144
You should probably shoot him.

01:24:44.146 --> 01:24:45.079
I won't say anything.

01:24:45.081 --> 01:24:46.180
- I'm riding in the ambulance.

01:24:46.182 --> 01:24:47.381
- Family only.

01:24:47.383 --> 01:24:48.582
Family only she's
not in my family.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:51.085
- Ray, this is not
what it looks like.

01:24:51.087 --> 01:24:52.352
- You know what your problem is?

01:24:52.354 --> 01:24:53.520
You lie to yourself constantly.

01:24:53.522 --> 01:24:55.089
Just be honest for once.

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:56.490
You don't give a shit
about me and you never did.

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:58.859
- That's not true I love you.

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:00.527
- I don't care what anyone says

01:25:00.529 --> 01:25:02.262
you are a good actress.

01:25:47.342 --> 01:25:48.809
- It's all fucked.

01:25:49.410 --> 01:25:50.410
I've ruined it.

01:25:52.413 --> 01:25:55.482
I really love your mother
you know that, right?

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:57.618
We make each other laugh.

01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.821
Might seem like a small
thing to you but it matters

01:26:00.823 --> 01:26:04.558
especially when you can
see the cliff up ahead.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.560
We weren't gonna
be rich or anything

01:26:06.562 --> 01:26:08.695
just enough to keep some
groceries in the refrigerator

01:26:08.697 --> 01:26:10.497
buy some sun screen

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:14.168
maybe get a little shack on
the beach and sell t-shirts.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:15.636
Now I get nothing.

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:17.371
God dammit.

01:26:19.307 --> 01:26:23.510
They'll carry me out of that
office in a plastic bag.

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:27.381
- This was your whole
retirement plan?

01:26:27.383 --> 01:26:29.449
You have no other money?

01:26:30.518 --> 01:26:32.186
- It's gone I worked
my ass off to pay off

01:26:32.188 --> 01:26:33.387
30 years worth of debt,

01:26:33.389 --> 01:26:34.922
so I could give you the
business in the clear

01:26:34.924 --> 01:26:36.857
now I've got Gornisht.

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:39.726
If I don't find 32 grand
before day after tomorrow,

01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:42.629
I lose the condo in fort
Meyers and the escrow money.

01:26:42.631 --> 01:26:44.731
All I wanted to do was
give my son a business

01:26:44.733 --> 01:26:46.567
make your mother happy.

01:26:46.569 --> 01:26:47.768
- You're so noble.

01:26:47.770 --> 01:26:49.436
When you hired two
guys to break my arm,

01:26:49.438 --> 01:26:52.606
were you just thinking
of everybody then too?

01:26:52.608 --> 01:26:56.476
- Let's not forget you two
were planning to rob me, okay?

01:26:56.478 --> 01:27:00.614
Don't act like you're better
than me neither of you.

01:27:02.584 --> 01:27:03.917
Let me out here.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:21.768
I'm sorry, honey, I'm sick
about, but it had to look real.

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:23.503
Now can tell you mom
about it if you want too

01:27:23.505 --> 01:27:27.708
but you're gonna be wrecking a
good thing really good thing.

01:27:28.776 --> 01:27:29.610
I don't know how in
the hell I'm gonna

01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:31.545
tell her about Florida.

01:27:32.647 --> 01:27:34.982
I'm sorry, but it
had to look real.

01:27:45.326 --> 01:27:47.461
- Are you gonna tell her?

01:27:47.996 --> 01:27:49.963
She'd never forgive him.

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.799
- The department store
where my mom works

01:27:52.801 --> 01:27:56.003
has that white ugly
fluorescent light.

01:27:58.406 --> 01:28:01.642
Nobody looks good in
that light, nobody

01:28:02.477 --> 01:28:03.577
I think they do it on purpose,

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:04.911
so that you hate
yourself and buy make up

01:28:04.913 --> 01:28:07.447
or a new dress or something.

01:28:08.850 --> 01:28:11.718
Anyway I was there the other day

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.588
and I saw her hand in that light

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:21.328
and see those little
blue veins under her skin

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:24.464
she's gonna be an old lady soon.

01:28:26.501 --> 01:28:28.402
Cannot leave her there
behind that counter

01:28:28.404 --> 01:28:32.539
taking shit from people
for the rest of her life.

01:28:33.608 --> 01:28:37.377
I have to do something
not just talk about it.

01:28:39.847 --> 01:28:44.051
Your dad is no prize, but
it's a way out at least.

01:28:47.522 --> 01:28:49.656
I can't let it evaporate.

01:28:56.532 --> 01:28:57.631
- Where were you?

01:28:57.633 --> 01:28:58.765
- I went out.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:00.734
- I come home to an empty house.

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:01.702
You don't even
answer your phone.

01:29:01.704 --> 01:29:03.937
- The battery is dead I'm fine.

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:05.339
- Where's ray?

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:06.807
- Mom, what do you want from me?

01:29:06.809 --> 01:29:08.709
- There is something
going on what is it?

01:29:08.711 --> 01:29:12.546
Whatever it is you can tell
me and I want the truth.

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.947
- What'll you have?

01:29:46.949 --> 01:29:47.848
- I'll take an old style.

01:29:47.850 --> 01:29:48.982
- Coming up.

01:29:48.984 --> 01:29:49.916
- Where's your bathroom?

01:29:49.918 --> 01:29:52.552
- Down at the end on the right.

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:28.088
- You do not matter.

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.557
No one is watching.

01:30:32.126 --> 01:30:33.493
You are free.

01:30:36.964 --> 01:30:38.632
You do not matter.

01:30:39.967 --> 01:30:41.701
No one is watching.

01:30:43.538 --> 01:30:44.638
You are free.

01:30:53.614 --> 01:30:56.049
Would you tell pop I need
to talk to him, please?

01:30:56.051 --> 01:30:57.651
- Excuse me.

01:30:57.653 --> 01:30:59.986
- Little pop
tell him he has a visitor.

01:30:59.988 --> 01:31:01.721
- I don't know who that is.

01:31:01.723 --> 01:31:04.191
- Tell him it's the Schlepper.

01:32:21.102 --> 01:32:22.769
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

01:32:22.771 --> 01:32:24.804
- Did you flip the stones yet?

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:26.540
- What's it to you?

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:30.210
- I have information that
is very important to you

01:32:30.212 --> 01:32:32.946
but I expect to be compensated.

01:32:34.549 --> 01:32:36.550
- How about you
tell me what it is

01:32:36.552 --> 01:32:38.818
and I'll compensate you
by not cutting you up

01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:42.088
and putting you in a dumpster
behind a hotdog stand.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:46.293
- I posted a picture online
of me sitting at your bar.

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:48.762
Local news loves
a dead white girl.

01:32:48.764 --> 01:32:49.696
You wouldn't mind
a few reporters

01:32:49.698 --> 01:32:51.031
and cops around here would you?

01:32:51.033 --> 01:32:52.198
- You're so clever.

01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:53.900
- I'm trying to do you a favor.

01:32:53.902 --> 01:32:57.337
- Why because my gun felt so
good up against your head.

01:32:57.339 --> 01:32:58.305
We're best friends now.

01:32:58.307 --> 01:32:59.706
You think I'm a fucking idiot.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:01.641
- Your friend Barry
put me in the hospital

01:33:01.643 --> 01:33:03.176
as a prop for the
insurance company.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:05.312
You think I'm gonna
just say no problem

01:33:05.314 --> 01:33:07.647
go get a waitressing job?

01:33:08.749 --> 01:33:10.283
You give me $5,000.

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:14.020
I save your ass and fuck
him over at the same time.

01:33:14.022 --> 01:33:15.589
- How about I give you a $100

01:33:15.591 --> 01:33:17.657
if I think the
information is useful.

01:33:17.659 --> 01:33:20.627
- 5,000 cash in
the next 30 seconds

01:33:20.629 --> 01:33:24.698
or I walk out of here and
you take your chances.

01:33:37.778 --> 01:33:39.846
- Get back here already.

01:33:59.333 --> 01:34:02.235
Alright Jimmy Olsen
let's have it.

01:34:04.772 --> 01:34:08.842
- Barry handleman is working
with the federal government.

01:34:08.844 --> 01:34:11.811
They have audio recordings
of you discussing the price

01:34:11.813 --> 01:34:14.147
and video surveillance of
you receiving the stones

01:34:14.149 --> 01:34:15.348
in the office.

01:34:16.183 --> 01:34:16.182
- Why the fuck would he do that?

01:34:16.184 --> 01:34:19.019
He's the one who ripped
them off to start with.

01:34:19.021 --> 01:34:21.254
- Well, one of the Columbians
got pinched by the ins

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:21.254
and rolled over on him.

01:34:21.256 --> 01:34:25.058
Barry got arrested for
insurance fraud and conspiracy

01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:26.960
so he gave them to you.

01:34:26.962 --> 01:34:28.028
- No chance.

01:34:29.130 --> 01:34:30.063
- You're gonna cross
in sault Ste. Marie

01:34:30.065 --> 01:34:31.197
and sell them them in Toronto.

01:34:31.199 --> 01:34:33.333
That's interstate something

01:34:33.335 --> 01:34:37.070
and international
diamond smuggling, right?

01:34:37.805 --> 01:34:39.172
Here's the real pisser.

01:34:39.174 --> 01:34:43.043
The stones he gave you
were fucking fakes anyway.

01:34:46.247 --> 01:34:47.447
- You're full of shit.

01:34:47.449 --> 01:34:48.715
- It's your funeral.

01:34:52.286 --> 01:34:53.687
- What's this?

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.822
- She's telling me a story.

01:34:55.824 --> 01:34:58.958
She says Barry's working
with the government

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.960
and the stones are fake.

01:35:01.962 --> 01:35:03.930
- That's nonsense they're real.

01:35:03.932 --> 01:35:06.966
- How do you
know you're an expert?

01:35:06.968 --> 01:35:10.937
- Well, I sell jewelry
of uncertain Providence.

01:35:12.173 --> 01:35:14.407
I have methods to ascertain
if a piece is a fake.

01:35:14.409 --> 01:35:16.810
- Methods, sounds serious.

01:35:17.778 --> 01:35:19.979
- Look, can I take a look?

01:35:43.771 --> 01:35:46.206
- So what do I do cut
glass with it or something?

01:35:46.208 --> 01:35:47.841
- Look my keys cut glass.

01:35:47.843 --> 01:35:49.509
First, breathe on it.

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:53.146
If it stays fogged up
for more than a second,

01:35:53.148 --> 01:35:54.214
it's a fake.

01:35:57.852 --> 01:35:59.018
- No, it's clear.

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:01.755
- Okay alright
that's a good sign.

01:36:01.757 --> 01:36:03.289
Let's see try this.

01:36:04.391 --> 01:36:06.860
- Is this the garbage test?

01:36:08.229 --> 01:36:11.498
- Lay that stone down
on its flat side.

01:36:12.767 --> 01:36:14.801
Okay now if you can
read the newsprint

01:36:14.803 --> 01:36:17.337
through the stone, it's a fake.

01:36:19.273 --> 01:36:20.774
- No, I can't see shit.

01:36:20.776 --> 01:36:22.976
- Let me see it.- Back up.

01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:27.180
Yeah, looks real to me.

01:36:27.182 --> 01:36:29.215
Go head let her see it.

01:36:30.284 --> 01:36:31.518
- Are you sure that's even true?

01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.852
- Absolutely.

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:36.122
Alright now hold
it up to the light.

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:41.494
You see that sparkle?

01:36:42.329 --> 01:36:44.164
Now anything can sparkle, right?

01:36:44.166 --> 01:36:48.368
But how you can spot a fake is
that it has no flaws at all.

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.470
Now do you see any little spots

01:36:50.472 --> 01:36:52.939
any little marks in the middle?

01:36:52.941 --> 01:36:55.542
- Maybe down in the pointy part.

01:36:56.177 --> 01:36:57.177
- Let me see it.

01:37:05.152 --> 01:37:06.953
No, I still don't see shit.

01:37:06.955 --> 01:37:08.521
- Right there
that's a real diamond.

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:10.957
- Man, you don't not what
you're talking about.

01:37:10.959 --> 01:37:12.091
- Get her out of here.

01:37:12.093 --> 01:37:13.893
Amateur hour's over.

01:37:14.428 --> 01:37:15.161
Get my money back.

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:16.129
- We had a deal.

01:37:16.131 --> 01:37:17.330
Are you fucking kidding.

01:37:17.332 --> 01:37:18.932
- No he's not.

01:37:18.934 --> 01:37:19.934
- Welcher.

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:23.303
- You're hurting
my feelings now.

01:37:23.305 --> 01:37:25.004
- This is some bullshit.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:27.607
- Sure is turn around.

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.278
- Dude, I can make
my way out all right.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:33.479
- You can.

01:37:33.481 --> 01:37:35.515
- Yeah, yeah I can stop
fucking following me.

01:37:35.517 --> 01:37:37.383
- Ask her to stop
fucking following me.

01:37:37.385 --> 01:37:39.385
- Hey, hey your
boss is an asshole.

01:37:39.387 --> 01:37:43.056
- Don't listen to her
keep fucking moving.

01:37:45.926 --> 01:37:46.593
- Nice job.

01:37:46.595 --> 01:37:48.127
- Yes, of course it is.

01:37:48.129 --> 01:37:49.195
I think we're good.

01:37:49.197 --> 01:37:50.396
- Yeah, I'll see you tonight?

01:37:50.398 --> 01:37:52.265
- Yes, also you better tell Alex

01:37:52.267 --> 01:37:54.634
that I want my end
in a briefcase.

01:37:54.636 --> 01:37:56.202
Okay, I'm a businessman

01:37:56.204 --> 01:37:57.904
with me like that.
- Yes, sir, yes, sir.

01:37:57.906 --> 01:37:58.906
- Okay.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.140
I know have a good one.

01:38:03.911 --> 01:38:04.911
Shit.

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:16.623
- That's my money.

01:38:17.458 --> 01:38:19.092
You understand that, mine?

01:38:19.894 --> 01:38:20.960
But I'm gonna let you hold it.

01:38:20.962 --> 01:38:22.528
You're gonna buy that condo.

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:24.030
You're gonna put my mom's name

01:38:24.032 --> 01:38:25.632
on the paper work next to yours

01:38:25.634 --> 01:38:27.133
and you're gonna send me a copy.

01:38:27.135 --> 01:38:28.902
If you try anything shady, Barry

01:38:28.904 --> 01:38:31.037
anything at all, I'm
gonna call the cops

01:38:31.039 --> 01:38:35.241
and I'm gonna report you for
insurance fraud, Kapiche?

01:38:36.310 --> 01:38:38.111
- I don't know what to say.

01:38:38.113 --> 01:38:39.113
Thank you.

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:40.914
What about pop?

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:42.282
- Just stay away.

01:38:43.384 --> 01:38:44.584
He thinks you're in
witness protection.

01:38:44.586 --> 01:38:46.619
- What happens when
he comes looking?

01:38:46.621 --> 01:38:48.054
- He got two stones.

01:38:48.056 --> 01:38:49.589
He's walking away with
a boat load of money.

01:38:49.591 --> 01:38:51.157
He's not coming after you

01:38:51.159 --> 01:38:52.926
especially because he thinks
the feds are watching.

01:38:52.928 --> 01:38:55.561
- I know him he'll just
come to the office.

01:38:55.563 --> 01:38:58.231
- The movers are gonna be
there tomorrow morning.

01:38:58.233 --> 01:38:59.265
I'm returning the stuff on memo

01:38:59.267 --> 01:39:01.534
and selling the rest to Hatoum.

01:39:01.536 --> 01:39:03.937
Looks like there's
gonna be 8500 left over.

01:39:03.939 --> 01:39:07.006
Congrats, you made
a profit old man.

01:39:07.441 --> 01:39:08.441
- Keep it.

01:39:09.143 --> 01:39:10.410
I'm just sorry
that's all there is.

01:39:10.412 --> 01:39:13.012
I wanted to leave you set up.

01:39:13.647 --> 01:39:15.548
- Your guilt is present enough.

01:39:16.283 --> 01:39:17.684
- You're welcome.

01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.355
- I put that one who put this?
- Yeah, but

01:39:22.357 --> 01:39:23.523
- I didn't put that.
- If you put these two boxes.

01:39:23.525 --> 01:39:24.724
- Give me this it's
gotta go in back now.

01:39:24.726 --> 01:39:28.094
- Well, okay, fine I
don't think it's open.

01:39:28.096 --> 01:39:29.362
- Open the door.

01:39:29.364 --> 01:39:31.431
- I don't have the
keys you have the keys.

01:39:31.433 --> 01:39:33.566
- You came down without the key.

01:39:42.543 --> 01:39:45.078
- I was just thinking about

01:39:46.146 --> 01:39:49.315
all the hours I spent
looking out this window

01:39:50.417 --> 01:39:52.151
wondering what was
gonna happen next.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:54.053
- Well, now you know.

01:40:00.327 --> 01:40:01.661
- Well, goodbye.

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:03.329
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:40:04.331 --> 01:40:06.466
- Alright, dad, okay.
- Okay, thanks.

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:10.036
- My girl, I love
you so, so, so, much.

01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.374
This is gonna be great.
- See you.

01:40:14.376 --> 01:40:15.408
- I'll call you
when I get there.

01:40:15.410 --> 01:40:17.010
- Please do.

01:40:17.012 --> 01:40:19.379
- Can we go I'd like to make
it to Memphis by nightfall.

01:40:19.381 --> 01:40:21.781
- Yeah, yeah, yeah
thus it begins.

01:40:21.783 --> 01:40:23.583
Okay, goodbye, baby.

01:40:25.119 --> 01:40:26.119
Goodbye.

01:40:26.687 --> 01:40:28.287
Goodbye I love you so much.

01:40:28.289 --> 01:40:30.456
Oh, my gosh I'll call you as
soon as I get there, okay.

01:40:30.458 --> 01:40:32.425
Alright don't forget about me.

01:40:32.427 --> 01:40:34.093
Call a lot, a lot.

01:40:34.595 --> 01:40:36.362
- Put your seat belt on.

01:40:36.797 --> 01:40:37.797
- Crazy kids.

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:41.601
- So when are you leaving?

01:40:41.603 --> 01:40:42.568
- This afternoon.

01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:43.736
Just cleaning up a little

01:40:43.738 --> 01:40:46.639
so she gets her
security deposit back.

01:40:47.474 --> 01:40:49.242
- You have enough for your trip?

01:40:49.244 --> 01:40:52.745
- Uh-huh, even got a
month's rent left over.

01:40:52.747 --> 01:40:54.280
- We didn't get rich did we?

01:40:54.282 --> 01:40:55.282
- Not yet.

01:41:00.287 --> 01:41:03.456
Maybe I'll see you in
fort Meyers at Christmas.

01:41:03.458 --> 01:41:04.458
- Yeah.

01:41:19.207 --> 01:41:23.276
- Look excuse me, sir, can you
just hold on for one second?

01:41:23.278 --> 01:41:24.278
Excuse me.

01:41:24.812 --> 01:41:25.812
Yeah.

01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.613
- I don't understand.

01:41:27.615 --> 01:41:29.248
I have the rest of
the money right here.

01:41:29.250 --> 01:41:30.349
I'm getting out of
this goddamn city,

01:41:30.351 --> 01:41:31.751
and I just want to pay it off.

01:41:31.753 --> 01:41:34.320
- Man, I'd love to take it
but it's already been paid.

01:41:34.322 --> 01:41:35.755
I sold a broad a corolla
like three days ago,

01:41:35.757 --> 01:41:37.490
and she paid off the whole note.

01:41:37.492 --> 01:41:39.492
- You saying some random
stranger paid off my note.

01:41:39.494 --> 01:41:41.427
- Maybe you have
a secret admirer.

01:41:41.429 --> 01:41:42.862
- Bullshit I'm a grown man.

01:41:42.864 --> 01:41:44.363
It's my debt I'm paying it off.

01:41:44.365 --> 01:41:46.099
- Okay, well, you have
to go pay her yourself.

01:41:46.101 --> 01:41:48.201
She left a forwarding
address for the title.

01:41:48.203 --> 01:41:49.702
It's in California.

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.508
- California.
- California.

01:42:19.266 --> 01:42:21.334
- They're ready for you.

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:23.803
- Hi, come on in.

01:42:24.538 --> 01:42:25.371
You can have a seat.

01:42:25.373 --> 01:42:26.239
- Hi, I'm Marilyn.

01:42:26.241 --> 01:42:27.507
- Hi.

01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:29.475
- Hi.

01:42:29.477 --> 01:42:34.447
- Alright you can start
whenever you're ready.

01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:38.818
- Hi, I'm Marilyn Tracy.

01:42:42.456 --> 01:42:45.892
Doctor, have the lab
results come in yet?

01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:47.927
- I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

01:42:47.929 --> 01:42:49.729
- God, my poor baby.

01:42:49.731 --> 01:42:52.298
- It seems your husband
contracted a parasite

01:42:52.300 --> 01:42:53.499
while he was in Africa.

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:54.800
- Well, that explains it.

01:42:54.802 --> 01:42:56.302
The sweating, the hives.

01:42:56.304 --> 01:42:57.904
- We may have to
consider a transplant.

01:42:57.906 --> 01:43:00.573
We need a donor, and
we're running out of time.

01:43:00.575 --> 01:43:02.942
- Doctor, I have an idea,

01:43:02.944 --> 01:43:04.877
but he can never know.

01:43:05.479 --> 01:43:06.479
We have a son.

01:43:10.184 --> 01:43:11.551
- Thanks so much, Marilyn.

01:43:11.553 --> 01:43:13.553
- Thanks bye.

01:43:24.731 --> 01:43:26.933
- She was good I liked it.
