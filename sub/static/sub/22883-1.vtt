01:25.500 --> 01:27.750
I need today's advertising paper.

01:28.791 --> 01:30.291
Could I have one, please?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.625
Here.

01:38.250 --> 01:39.250
Thank you.

02:03.750 --> 02:07.375
-Will they fix the elevator?
-Of course they will.

02:08.750 --> 02:11.333
I'm not a liar.

02:11.541 --> 02:13.541
I didn't mean it that way.

02:14.375 --> 02:18.666
So many people live here, my dear.
Not everyone will take the stairs.

02:18.875 --> 02:21.708
There's even
a high-up official living here.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.708
It's been disconnected. Never mind.

02:26.916 --> 02:28.416
The bill must be due.

02:28.625 --> 02:32.000
I'll pay it before you move in,
so they will reconnect the power.

02:32.208 --> 02:35.958
It's been empty for two months,
but it was always rented out before that.

02:36.166 --> 02:38.625
The balcony is the highlight
of the apartment.

02:38.833 --> 02:40.083
It's very sunny here.

02:40.333 --> 02:44.541
If the sun's too hot, you can open
a parasol, so no problem there.

02:44.750 --> 02:49.291
Come and see here, too.
Then make up your mind.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.541
See how dirty it is?

02:51.750 --> 02:55.291
I couldn't find anyone
to clean all this mess.

02:58.333 --> 03:03.083
Just so you know,
the last tenants were very happy.

03:03.250 --> 03:08.708
Even happier when they moved on
to a better house and better things.

03:09.125 --> 03:11.791
It's that kind of apartment.

03:11.958 --> 03:15.958
It brings luck.
Do you believe in luck? I do.

03:16.125 --> 03:18.708
-Is this the kitchen?
-The kitchen is here.

03:18.958 --> 03:22.083
Here's the bathroom.

03:22.291 --> 03:26.625
The bathroom and the toilet.
I'll show it to you now, my dear.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.375
See, everything's in order.
Come and look here.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.416
Do you like it?

03:35.750 --> 03:38.750
There's nothing bad about this apartment.

03:39.125 --> 03:40.791
Here's the second balcony.

03:41.000 --> 03:45.583
You can't find this design
anywhere else, not at this price.

03:45.958 --> 03:52.916
It's not expensive. No one else
would let it for this price.

03:55.125 --> 03:56.583
Do you have a family?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.125
What's this, Manana?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.125
-I cook dinner and you're eating cake?
-I don't want dinner.

04:15.750 --> 04:21.833
You could have your dinner
and eat dessert afterwards.

04:22.791 --> 04:25.875
You always do this, always.

04:29.666 --> 04:31.250
Just look at this.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.750
-Why's it here?
-Leave it alone.

04:33.958 --> 04:36.791
And he says I should leave it alone.

04:37.291 --> 04:40.958
We've been bending over backwards
to pay for his lessons.

04:42.166 --> 04:45.708
We spend so much money on his whims.

04:46.166 --> 04:49.875
I don't believe
he'll ever give up on his computer.

04:52.416 --> 04:55.875
Why do you stand here
staring at these children?

04:56.083 --> 04:59.750
Leave them alone, they're young.
Go and eat your meal.

04:59.916 --> 05:02.916
They can go elsewhere, can't they?

05:03.250 --> 05:06.541
They can't help it, Otar.
They love each other.

05:06.750 --> 05:08.583
You'd better watch it, Lasha.

05:12.291 --> 05:13.458
Sweet mercy...

05:14.208 --> 05:15.375
By the way, Lamara...

05:15.583 --> 05:18.166
you and Otar
should follow their example.

05:18.375 --> 05:20.041
Soso and Manana, you too.

05:20.750 --> 05:21.958
It's never too late.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.333
Shut up and stop moaning.

05:25.541 --> 05:27.791
If you had the guts, you'd find someone.

05:28.000 --> 05:32.583
What guts? He either
sleeps all day or sits at the computer.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.208
What are you talking about?

05:35.291 --> 05:36.583
Manana!

05:36.666 --> 05:38.083
We're waiting for you.

05:45.375 --> 05:47.041
-Do you want some?
-Yes.

05:52.791 --> 05:55.250
-Good morning.
-Hello.

05:55.833 --> 05:59.541
-It's Manana's birthday today.
-I know.

05:59.750 --> 06:02.583
I'm glad you know.

06:03.500 --> 06:06.333
Everyone forgets everything here,
except me.

06:08.625 --> 06:09.875
Happy birthday.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.500
Thank you.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.583
Move that glass, please. Here we go.

06:27.250 --> 06:30.291
Manana, do you see this mess?

06:30.500 --> 06:35.333
Why can't I get the boy to stop eating
straight from the fridge?

06:35.541 --> 06:40.250
He eats cherries with a spoon
and leaves stains everywhere.

06:40.458 --> 06:44.333
I can't stand it, I clean it every day,
the same thing every day.

06:44.541 --> 06:46.375
He won't listen.

06:52.083 --> 06:54.708
How are things going?
Have you finished everything?

06:54.916 --> 06:56.500
Finished?

06:56.708 --> 06:59.916
She didn't sleep a wink all night.

07:04.166 --> 07:07.375
<i>Happy is the family</i>

07:07.583 --> 07:11.583
<i>with a peaceful mother</i>

07:11.791 --> 07:18.041
<i>where she sacrifices herself</i>
<i>for her family,</i>

07:18.250 --> 07:20.000
<i>raises children...</i>

07:26.666 --> 07:29.625
Vakho, I'll go in with you
quickly to take my clothes.

07:29.833 --> 07:31.666
I don't want to wake Nino.

07:38.541 --> 07:42.416
Vakho, please, don't make any noise.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.166
Where's my jacket?

07:58.166 --> 07:59.166
Are you ready?

08:00.416 --> 08:03.750
Go to the market after work.

08:04.500 --> 08:09.291
Buy me some dill and new potatoes,
also some cheese for <i>Khachapuri</i>.

08:09.500 --> 08:13.708
And a chicken, too.
I'll roast it this evening.

08:14.208 --> 08:16.166
Soso will bring wine.

08:16.375 --> 08:20.041
Mother, I'm not going to celebrate
my birthday or invite anyone.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.083
I'm in no mood to see anyone.

08:22.416 --> 08:23.416
But...

08:24.083 --> 08:27.666
If people come,
should I meet them empty-handed?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.541
You really amaze me.

08:31.750 --> 08:35.500
Rezo will come,
and Bela too, with their children.

08:35.707 --> 08:38.541
-Just one <i>Khachapuri</i>.
-Not now, we're late.

09:10.708 --> 09:14.208
-You're going to buy wine?
-Of course. Shouldn't I?

09:18.000 --> 09:20.625
I am not in the mood
to celebrate my birthday.

09:21.416 --> 09:22.750
Don't celebrate then.

09:24.666 --> 09:27.250
-People will still come.
-What people?

09:28.208 --> 09:29.375
I don't know...

09:30.333 --> 09:32.916
Your brother may come.

09:33.250 --> 09:37.125
Bela might come with her children.
People will come, you know.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.250
Please, don't buy wine.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.333
If we have nothing...

09:50.500 --> 09:52.666
they'll just come and talk a bit.

09:52.875 --> 09:56.125
If you lay out a feast,
they won't leave till morning.

09:56.375 --> 09:59.500
If they come,
we can't take them to an empty table.

10:00.250 --> 10:02.458
You talk like Lamara.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.125
I didn't invite anyone.
Why must we have a feast?

10:07.541 --> 10:11.666
What have I done, that
I can't spend my birthday as I wish?

10:11.875 --> 10:14.458
Do what you want, no one's stopping you.

10:20.416 --> 10:23.958
Is <i>The Martyrdom of Shushanik</i>
a family drama?

10:25.041 --> 10:28.250
From a present day perspective, it is.

10:28.458 --> 10:32.250
However, it can be said that in this work,

10:32.583 --> 10:37.541
 the conflict is based on religion,
exceeding the bounds of family drama.

10:39.541 --> 10:42.625
We'll continue this next lesson.

10:42.791 --> 10:45.666
You should write
an essay on Prince Varsken,

10:46.166 --> 10:48.583
using the instructions
on the blackboard.

10:48.791 --> 10:50.416
-Ok, teacher, bye.
-Goodbye.

10:50.625 --> 10:51.625
Wait for me.

10:51.833 --> 10:53.416
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.041
Has anyone seen Chigogidze?

10:56.250 --> 10:59.958
-She skipped her other classes.
-She's missed too many classes.

11:00.125 --> 11:02.000
I can't give her a grade this semester.

11:02.291 --> 11:04.958
-I'll tell her if I see her. Bye.
-Bye.

11:06.208 --> 11:08.000
Hang on a minute.

11:08.291 --> 11:11.625
-Happy birthday, have a good one.
-Thank you.

11:15.833 --> 11:19.791
If I don't put this chicken
in the oven now,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.833
God knows when I'll roast it. Get out.

11:23.041 --> 11:24.958
Get out now.

11:26.125 --> 11:29.291
-Someone's here?
-Yes, that's why I'm in a hurry.

11:29.500 --> 11:32.458
-I wish you'd come earlier.
-Hang on.

11:32.666 --> 11:34.375
I wanted to ask you something.

11:34.583 --> 11:37.500
Can you take your clothes
from my room the night before?

11:37.750 --> 11:40.541
The wardrobe is so noisy,
I can't get back to sleep.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.083
-Ok.
-What's this?

11:43.916 --> 11:47.541
I asked you for dill, not fennel.

11:48.833 --> 11:52.875
I'm talking to you.
Can't you tell dill from fennel?

11:53.083 --> 11:55.625
-I don't know, Mother.
-I asked for dill.

11:55.833 --> 11:58.958
-Happy birthday, Mom.
-Who's here?

11:59.125 --> 12:02.625
Soso's doctors.
Also Samkharadze senior and junior.

12:02.833 --> 12:04.291
I don't have a present.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.375
When I start working,
I'll buy you whatever you want.

12:07.583 --> 12:11.666
I'm hungry. Will dinner be ready soon?

12:11.875 --> 12:15.666
I hope you provide for your family,
if someone ever marries you.

12:16.708 --> 12:21.125
-She can live without your present.
-She's been grumbling all day.

12:21.375 --> 12:25.750
You sit at the computer all day.
As soon as he gets up, he rushes to it.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.458
-Am I hurting anyone?
-Yes, yourself.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.875
Use a glass. And put it back where it was.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.000
There are stains all around the fridge.

12:38.208 --> 12:41.291
What do you want? Don't stress us, please.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.916
-Careful.
-You be careful.

12:44.125 --> 12:47.208
Get a hair cut, boy,
you can't see a thing.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.916
You're here.

12:49.625 --> 12:52.083
-They're waiting for you.
-For me?

12:52.291 --> 12:54.625
Who else? Whose birthday is it?

12:55.291 --> 12:57.000
Lamara, please rinse this.

13:04.291 --> 13:05.291
They are for you.

13:06.375 --> 13:08.458
-Thank you.
-Look where he hid it.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.416
-Doesn't it need water?
-Come.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.000
-Me?
-Of course.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.083
I can't.

13:13.291 --> 13:15.833
They're asking for you.
Don't drive me crazy.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.291
Lamara will take care of this.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.708
-Come.
-Please, I can't.

13:21.416 --> 13:23.875
-Here's the birthday girl.
-Happy birthday.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.833
-Thank you, how are you?
-Happy birthday.

13:31.416 --> 13:35.375
<i>How could I ever live without you?</i>

13:37.583 --> 13:42.125
<i>Or how could I spend my life?</i>

13:44.208 --> 13:47.875
<i>Because it is so difficult</i>
<i>to live without you</i>

13:49.500 --> 13:55.041
<i>I came to you and you took over my mind</i>

13:58.750 --> 14:03.000
<i>Took over my mind</i>

14:04.583 --> 14:07.250
<i>You blew my mind</i>

14:09.458 --> 14:11.333
<i>And if I can wait</i>

14:11.541 --> 14:14.750
Nino will open it. Where are you going?

14:20.083 --> 14:21.583
Happy birthday!

14:22.750 --> 14:23.958
Happy birthday.

14:24.166 --> 14:28.083
Look who's here. My darlings!

14:30.458 --> 14:31.458
How are you?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.708
How are things with you? How are you?

14:34.916 --> 14:36.583
My dears.

14:36.791 --> 14:38.375
Rezo, where were you?

14:38.583 --> 14:42.083
I got tired of waiting for you.
Look who's here.

14:42.291 --> 14:45.458
My angel, let's go and see
the singing men.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.666
Look who's here.

14:48.875 --> 14:50.791
-They are for you.
-You shouldn't have.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.083
-It was a pleasure.
-How are you and the children?

14:54.333 --> 14:56.833
Who's there? There are so many people.

15:18.333 --> 15:20.125
Don't tell anyone, OK?

15:21.500 --> 15:24.208
<i>I said I'd come to you</i>

15:26.375 --> 15:28.333
<i>I'd always come to you</i>

15:33.458 --> 15:39.458
<i>There was a time when</i>
<i>You could hear my heartbeat</i>

15:41.333 --> 15:42.708
Let's go, they're tired.

15:42.916 --> 15:45.000
-I'm not tired.
-Keso.

15:45.916 --> 15:50.250
-They have school tomorrow.
-Bela, leave me alone, please.

15:50.625 --> 15:54.125
-Rezo. It's late.
-Ok, let's go.

15:54.333 --> 15:57.666
Just a minute.
Have you finished drinking here?

15:58.416 --> 16:00.541
Goga, pour me one, please.

16:02.291 --> 16:07.541
David, don't stop for a moment.
I want to drink to my sister.

16:07.750 --> 16:12.083
A wonderful, most beautiful
and kind person.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.416
I don't know anyone like her...

16:19.208 --> 16:22.208
Who she was, is and will be...
What else can I say?

16:22.416 --> 16:24.208
Cheers to our Manana.

16:37.000 --> 16:40.625
Please, join us for a minute,
just this once.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.416
Are you so unhappy to see them?
They're really good guys.

16:47.041 --> 16:52.458
Just come for 15 minutes, sit with me.
That's all, nothing more.

16:53.416 --> 16:55.708
They won't spend the night here.

16:55.916 --> 16:58.208
How many times do I have to ask?

16:58.458 --> 17:01.291
-Soso, where are you?
-I'm coming.

17:01.500 --> 17:04.540
Come, at least for Rezo. For your brother.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.708
I swear on the life of Lasha and Nino.

17:12.875 --> 17:17.500
In an hour I'll send them all away,
no one will be here.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.958
Just come in, sit there
for 15 minutes and then go.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.583
-Good.
-What?

17:24.540 --> 17:26.708
Nothing. They're calling you, go.

17:32.916 --> 17:35.000
What's the matter with you?

17:56.583 --> 17:58.833
You finally came in. Bravo.

18:04.458 --> 18:07.500
Couldn't you have come
five minutes earlier?

18:07.708 --> 18:11.125
The chicken was so delicious.
There was enough for you.

18:11.333 --> 18:15.916
-And we wouldn't have felt ashamed.
-There's no chicken left? I'm hungry.

18:16.125 --> 18:19.083
Hungry? Weren't you here?
Why didn't you eat?

18:19.875 --> 18:21.833
-Did Nino and Vakho go to bed?
-Yes.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.666
I'm wondering...

18:24.208 --> 18:29.083
My friends who were here...
What will they think of me now?

18:29.708 --> 18:35.000
They came to show
their respect for you, sang songs.

18:35.958 --> 18:38.416
You let them leave without saying goodbye.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.666
-Do you think that's OK?
-I didn't invite those people.

18:42.875 --> 18:44.916
Whoever invited them should host them.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.916
Oh, really?

18:47.125 --> 18:50.041
Who do you think was a guest?
Was your brother a guest?

18:50.208 --> 18:51.333
Was Rezo alone?

18:51.500 --> 18:53.500
You invited 20 people when I said not to.

18:53.708 --> 18:55.375
20 people? You exaggerate.

18:55.583 --> 18:59.083
Rezo will understand that
I was in no mood for a feast.

18:59.291 --> 19:03.458
Why weren't you?
What happened? Did someone die?

19:04.916 --> 19:08.750
It's your birthday. Cheer up a bit.

19:08.958 --> 19:12.208
It's no longer her birthday.
It's past midnight.

19:12.458 --> 19:16.916
That's not the point.
Look how he's talking to me.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.750
-He wants to make me nervous.
-Come on, Lamara.

19:20.958 --> 19:24.791
-Don't get nervous then.
-Do you think it's that easy?

19:25.000 --> 19:28.166
Can't you see,
you make problems out of nothing?

19:28.916 --> 19:32.458
How do you do it? Do you enjoy it?

19:33.791 --> 19:37.250
I can't live here.
I want to leave this house.

19:38.375 --> 19:42.375
It seems we are really bad, nasty guys.

19:42.583 --> 19:45.375
-Soso, please, stop it.
-Wait a minute.

19:45.583 --> 19:49.583
We are so nasty
that she's forced to leave.

19:49.791 --> 19:53.083
-Why does she threaten us?
-Come on, Soso, my dear.

19:53.291 --> 19:54.583
Leave her alone.

19:54.875 --> 19:56.000
Leave her.

19:56.541 --> 19:59.000
You know where she gets it from.

19:59.333 --> 20:05.500
I could never understand my husband,
what makes him happy or unhappy.

20:05.791 --> 20:07.916
You can't understand it.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.000
-Goodbye, teacher.
-Goodbye.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.708
Goodbye. Chigogidze?

20:19.166 --> 20:20.458
Yes?

20:21.041 --> 20:22.416
Come here a minute.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.666
Why have you missed so many classes?

20:29.375 --> 20:30.375
Please tell me.

20:33.083 --> 20:34.833
I had problems, teacher.

20:35.708 --> 20:39.166
What problems
can a 17-year old girl have

20:39.375 --> 20:41.375
that make her miss school for a month?

20:41.583 --> 20:42.875
Were you ill?

20:45.833 --> 20:46.833
Tell me.

20:48.250 --> 20:51.333
-I divorced my husband, teacher.
-Divorced?

20:52.416 --> 20:54.333
When did you get married?

20:56.208 --> 20:57.708
Last semester.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.208
Wait.

21:11.375 --> 21:12.375
Sit down.

21:13.750 --> 21:14.750
Come.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.333
How are you now?

21:28.125 --> 21:29.125
Fine.

21:31.208 --> 21:33.875
Did something happen?
Why did you divorce him?

21:35.166 --> 21:37.500
We just didn't understand each other.

21:37.750 --> 21:39.750
We're very different.

21:40.708 --> 21:42.458
It just didn't work out.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.208
How old is he?

21:46.750 --> 21:50.000
His birthday was the day
before yesterday. He's 21.

21:52.416 --> 21:55.000
Did you live alone or with someone else?

21:57.291 --> 21:59.708
At first, we lived with his mother.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.375
Then we rented an apartment.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.750
But it still didn't work out.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.583
If I wanted something, he didn't want it.

22:11.791 --> 22:14.250
If he wanted something, I didn't want it.

22:14.916 --> 22:18.333
I told him that it wouldn't work out,
and I left him.

22:18.916 --> 22:20.250
What did he say?

22:24.125 --> 22:28.125
Just one thing, teacher.
If you say no, you should mean it.

22:28.500 --> 22:30.875
You shouldn't look like you're hesitating.

22:31.083 --> 22:32.916
Otherwise, it makes no sense.

22:34.583 --> 22:38.125
Many girls tell their sweethearts
that they're leaving.

22:38.333 --> 22:40.041
But they get back together.

22:41.541 --> 22:43.875
If you say it once, you should do it.

22:44.916 --> 22:46.458
That's my opinion.

22:51.375 --> 22:53.000
Do you agree with me?

22:54.416 --> 22:55.416
Yes.

23:01.416 --> 23:02.416
Good.

23:07.208 --> 23:12.375
We've covered this material in class.
Review it and prepare for the test.

23:13.541 --> 23:15.333
Don't miss classes, OK?

23:16.416 --> 23:18.958
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.875
Is this dill or fennel?

23:55.083 --> 23:58.625
Can't you see it isn't fennel?
It's dill. Real dill.

23:58.833 --> 24:01.916
I was only asking.
Could I have a bag, please?

24:06.791 --> 24:08.458
How much are the cucumbers?

24:08.666 --> 24:10.958
Where are they from, Lagodekhi?

24:11.375 --> 24:13.375
Give me one kilo.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.083
-I need tomatoes, too.
-Sorry.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.625
You're not taking it?

24:51.791 --> 24:53.541
Mom, has someone hurt you?

24:55.083 --> 24:56.083
No.

24:58.291 --> 25:02.041
Father, can you explain?
We want to know what's going on.

25:02.375 --> 25:05.791
Don't hold out on us.
Tell us if someone hurt you.

25:06.083 --> 25:10.375
If you want to leave for a bit
or if you have some work,

25:10.583 --> 25:11.708
or you need a break...

25:11.916 --> 25:14.583
-I'm not leaving for a bit.
-You can tell us.

25:14.791 --> 25:17.416
I'm leaving for good, I told you already.

25:18.500 --> 25:20.583
Did you really rent an apartment?

25:21.125 --> 25:24.291
You're going to live alone
in a rented apartment?

25:26.083 --> 25:28.833
I can't understand
why she doesn't like it here.

25:32.208 --> 25:34.375
Mom, please, tell us who hurt you.

25:38.958 --> 25:41.708
-Soso, was it you?
-Leave me alone, boy.

25:44.500 --> 25:46.208
Did you hurt her?

25:46.416 --> 25:49.083
-Why would I hurt her?
-I don't know...

25:54.166 --> 25:55.708
Was it me who hurt you?

25:57.000 --> 25:59.125
No, it's nothing to do with you.

25:59.333 --> 26:02.333
But what's up?
Why won't you tell us anything?

26:07.625 --> 26:09.541
Mom, I asked you a question.

26:10.041 --> 26:13.375
Maybe she doesn't want to answer.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.375
Let her keep it private.

26:17.375 --> 26:20.958
It's utterly incredible
how he manages to stay so calm.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.375
She moves out of the house,

26:23.541 --> 26:27.083
leaving her family,
and he says, "Let her keep it private."

26:27.291 --> 26:29.500
He drives me nuts.

26:30.583 --> 26:31.916
I can't stand it.

26:34.666 --> 26:39.833
Ok, you don't respect your parents,
you don't respect your children.

26:40.041 --> 26:43.875
At least tell your husband why
you're leaving and where you're going.

26:44.083 --> 26:45.708
Shouldn't we know why?

26:45.958 --> 26:50.291
I told you I rented an apartment.
It's in Varketili.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.458
And I'm moving there today.
I don't want to live with you.

26:53.791 --> 26:56.625
They're adults now
and can look after themselves.

26:56.833 --> 26:59.208
-Well done.
-What should we tell people?

26:59.375 --> 27:01.708
Should we say our parents divorced?

27:02.375 --> 27:04.458
Nino, wake up. How old are you?

27:04.666 --> 27:07.500
Worry about your own family, not about us.

27:07.708 --> 27:10.791
Lasha, go and call Rezo.

27:11.000 --> 27:15.166
Is Rezo my judge or superior?
Better he deal with his own family.

27:15.375 --> 27:17.500
-Call him.
-He can't tell me what to do.

27:17.708 --> 27:20.291
She made Rezo my judge.

27:21.083 --> 27:24.750
I'm a grown woman, stop giving me lessons.

27:25.208 --> 27:26.250
Call Rezo now.

27:26.500 --> 27:28.875
Do you think I'll get scared if he comes?

27:30.041 --> 27:33.791
Wait. I want to tell you something.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.791
I'm just wondering...

27:37.625 --> 27:40.250
Tell me why you're going, and where.

27:40.500 --> 27:43.875
I don't have to explain it to you.
I'll explain to Soso.

27:44.083 --> 27:46.791
-Now leave me alone.
-Explain what to Soso?

27:47.000 --> 27:51.416
That you're leaving him and the children?

27:51.625 --> 27:54.208
-Leaving him with your parents?
-It's not my problem.

27:54.416 --> 27:57.500
If he wants to go, he's free to go.
Am I stopping him?

27:57.708 --> 28:00.583
-I'll go.
-See, he can look after himself.

28:00.791 --> 28:02.291
I'll find a place to go.

28:03.541 --> 28:07.583
What don't you like about him?
Please tell me.

28:08.333 --> 28:09.791
What's wrong with him?

28:10.000 --> 28:13.083
He's not a drunkard. He doesn't drink.

28:13.291 --> 28:16.791
If he drinks, he does so in moderation.

28:17.416 --> 28:18.916
Come off it, Mother.

28:19.083 --> 28:24.333
He isn't a thief or robber.
He isn't a criminal or drug addict.

28:24.541 --> 28:28.250
What else do you want?
He loves his children.

28:28.458 --> 28:32.916
He's never raised a hand against you.
You should see what other husbands do.

28:33.083 --> 28:36.166
-I don't care about other husbands.
-Why should you?

28:36.458 --> 28:41.333
You had everything handed to you.
You don't appreciate anything.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.541
You had everything ahead of you.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.583
You got married, got an education, a job.

28:47.791 --> 28:50.250
You lived your life undisturbed.
You gave birth.

28:50.416 --> 28:53.250
You did no housework.
You didn't raise your kids.

28:53.458 --> 28:55.833
I did. I've been your servant
all your life.

28:56.000 --> 28:58.083
Did I ask you to be my servant?

28:58.291 --> 28:59.916
-Did I?
-Stop, people.

29:00.791 --> 29:03.291
Leave me alone, Mother.

29:03.500 --> 29:06.958
You should've seen
what kind of a husband your father was.

29:07.166 --> 29:09.208
-You have no idea.
-Leave me alone.

29:09.416 --> 29:10.791
Just leave me alone.

29:11.000 --> 29:14.083
-We raised you and Rezo in hardship.
-Leave me alone.

29:14.291 --> 29:15.333
I can't.

29:15.541 --> 29:18.791
I won't let you go.
You aren't going anywhere.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.458
I will, you can't keep me.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.583
Please, let her go.

29:22.791 --> 29:25.000
Leave her alone.

29:25.208 --> 29:28.041
Please, leave her alone.
We'll talk to her later.

29:28.250 --> 29:31.625
-You shouldn't interfere.
-Stop it, don't shout.

29:34.875 --> 29:36.166
What's up with you?

29:39.333 --> 29:44.583
You disgrace your husband,
your parents and children.

29:44.791 --> 29:46.708
You disgrace all of us.

29:46.916 --> 29:50.458
You disgrace us
in front of our neighbors. Let me go.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.583
-Here you go, and thank you.
-You're welcome, goodbye.

30:31.791 --> 30:32.791
Goodbye.

32:30.208 --> 32:33.291
Listen to what I say.
Do you understand me?

32:34.750 --> 32:38.166
Rezo, I'm not a small child.
I know what I'm doing.

32:40.333 --> 32:42.958
-You think you're better off now?
-Yes.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.083
Don't you think about Soso?

32:46.291 --> 32:50.500
Do you think it's OK to leave
Soso alone with Lamara and Otar?

32:50.666 --> 32:54.708
He can go and live elsewhere.
I didn't ask him to live with my parents.

32:59.250 --> 33:01.041
I don't want it...

33:01.250 --> 33:04.000
I don't want everyone
talking about my sister.

33:04.208 --> 33:06.333
Do you want me to kill someone?

33:06.541 --> 33:10.041
I can't understand why you'll have
problems because of me.

33:10.291 --> 33:13.916
How did you find this apartment?
Why in this district?

33:14.166 --> 33:16.875
I rented an apartment I could afford.

33:20.333 --> 33:21.333
Right.

33:22.875 --> 33:24.083
I want to know

33:24.291 --> 33:27.083
how much the rent is
and how much you earn.

33:28.000 --> 33:32.291
I won't die of hunger.
I can tutor children, if necessary.

33:32.875 --> 33:35.583
Many graduates ask me for private classes.

33:38.166 --> 33:40.750
-Does anyone support you financially?
-What?

33:40.916 --> 33:42.333
Who would support me?

33:42.666 --> 33:45.875
I don't know, your friends?
Or you might be seeing someone?

33:46.083 --> 33:49.083
Seeing someone?
What are you talking about?

33:51.208 --> 33:53.708
Who was that strange man in your class?

33:54.750 --> 33:56.750
Why do you talk to me like this?

33:57.666 --> 33:59.791
He's my colleague, Gogi Sekhniashvil.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.833
He teaches Georgian language
and literature.

34:03.791 --> 34:06.000
You treat me like a little girl.

34:06.666 --> 34:10.750
I don't need anyone to protect
or control me. I'm a grown woman.

34:10.916 --> 34:13.583
You just look after
yourself and your family.

34:13.791 --> 34:15.666
Leave me alone, all of you.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.208
Ok, as you wish.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.291
Do you need a lift to Varketili?

34:28.666 --> 34:30.541
No, I'm not going home yet.

34:42.500 --> 34:45.416
I'm going to your old home on Sunday.

34:46.250 --> 34:49.041
You come, too.
Let's sit and talk together.

34:50.416 --> 34:52.583
Haven't we talked it over already?

34:52.916 --> 34:56.583
I don't need to go there.
Everyone's angry.

34:56.916 --> 35:00.708
Manana, I implore you, do this for me.

35:01.708 --> 35:05.416
Let's sit together
and talk it over quietly.

35:06.541 --> 35:08.041
Please respect me.

35:08.625 --> 35:10.458
Do this for me,

35:10.666 --> 35:13.583
and I swear
I'll never ask anything of you

35:13.791 --> 35:15.458
or bother you again.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.416
-Who is it?
-Gas service.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.541
You live here now?

35:57.708 --> 36:01.250
-Are you a relative of Miranda's?
-No, I've just moved in.

36:01.958 --> 36:04.916
I thought you were her sister
or a relative.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.791
-Do you know Miranda?
-No.

36:08.250 --> 36:10.208
She was a very good girl.

36:10.416 --> 36:13.083
Do you know what she did?
What happened here?

36:13.291 --> 36:16.333
She tried to poison herself with gas.
It was a big thing.

36:16.541 --> 36:18.083
It was terrible.

36:18.291 --> 36:23.708
Police, fire brigade, ambulance...
There was a big fuss.

36:23.916 --> 36:26.083
Poor thing, her nerves were shot.

36:40.666 --> 36:41.666
Thank you.

37:04.125 --> 37:05.541
Let's go.

38:26.500 --> 38:28.666
Nino, it's me. How are you?

38:33.583 --> 38:35.833
Where are you? Are you OK?

38:41.000 --> 38:43.375
I just called you to see how you were.

38:49.708 --> 38:52.958
Ok, sure. Go now, take care.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.583
Kisses to you too.

39:15.041 --> 39:16.125
How are you?

39:18.000 --> 39:19.625
What's up, Vakho?

39:20.833 --> 39:24.208
Could I talk to you for a minute,
if you have time?

39:27.541 --> 39:29.916
-Ok, go ahead.
-Come here, please.

39:35.166 --> 39:40.583
I'm very sorry to come here
to talk to you.

39:40.875 --> 39:44.375
I can't talk about it at home,
and besides, I don't know...

39:44.916 --> 39:46.458
when I'll see you again.

39:46.625 --> 39:49.208
What you saw the other day,
it's not what you think.

39:49.416 --> 39:51.625
You don't have to explain anything to me.

39:51.791 --> 39:55.000
Let's keep it between us,
don't say anything to Nino.

39:55.208 --> 39:56.416
Wait, let's talk.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.875
Don't put me in this situation.
Sort it out yourself.

40:00.250 --> 40:04.291
I wouldn't like it if my mother
interfered between me and my husband.

40:04.500 --> 40:07.583
-You'd better go and talk to Nino.
-Of course.

40:07.791 --> 40:11.500
But don't tell her anything.
I'll explain everything to her.

40:11.708 --> 40:13.666
Don't try to bargain with me.

40:14.375 --> 40:16.958
I can't give you any hope or guarantees.

40:17.166 --> 40:19.416
-Go and talk to Nino.
-Ok.

40:19.625 --> 40:22.000
-I have to go.
-Please don't tell her.

40:33.875 --> 40:35.375
-How are you?
-Fine, you?

40:35.583 --> 40:36.958
Not too bad.

40:37.458 --> 40:39.125
-What's up?
-Come in.

40:43.291 --> 40:44.458
Hello.

40:45.250 --> 40:46.875
-Hello.
-How are you?

40:47.083 --> 40:48.416
Father, how are you?

40:56.166 --> 40:59.166
What's wrong? Is everything OK?
You look like someone died.

40:59.416 --> 41:02.791
It's worse than death, much worse.

41:03.083 --> 41:05.625
-Do you feel unwell?
-Very bad.

41:05.833 --> 41:08.708
If you feel bad,
call a doctor, not your relatives.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.208
Leave me alone.

41:10.416 --> 41:12.791
-I called these people.
-Right.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.333
We want to talk to you.

41:15.541 --> 41:19.208
-We're a family, aren't we?
-Do you want to talk to me?

41:20.000 --> 41:22.750
I'm here, talk to me, I'm all ears.

41:22.958 --> 41:26.625
Please,
tell me why you think we wish you harm?

41:26.791 --> 41:29.625
-I don't think that.
-Look at Dato.

41:29.833 --> 41:33.458
When he heard about you and Soso,
he couldn't sleep for two nights.

41:33.666 --> 41:36.750
Come on. Were you worried about me?

41:38.666 --> 41:40.291
You're like my elder sister.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.583
-We grew up together.
-I know.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.416
I feel uncomfortable
interfering like this.

41:45.625 --> 41:48.708
I respect Soso, too.
But I want to tell you one thing.

41:49.916 --> 41:52.833
I won't forgive anyone hurting you.

41:53.041 --> 41:54.208
Dato, my dear...

41:54.458 --> 41:56.666
That's all I wanted to say.

41:56.875 --> 42:00.125
Thank you very much, but no one hurt me.

42:00.375 --> 42:04.583
-You're worrying for nothing.
-For God's sake, Dato, sit down.

42:04.833 --> 42:06.500
Don't pace up and down.

42:08.625 --> 42:13.291
No one's hurt Manana
and you shouldn't say that.

42:13.583 --> 42:15.666
There are elderly people here.

42:17.208 --> 42:20.875
I beg you to listen to them.
They might say something wise.

42:21.083 --> 42:22.250
You might like it.

42:23.000 --> 42:26.583
If not, then ignore it.
And we'll leave you alone.

42:27.083 --> 42:28.375
Ok, I'm listening.

42:30.541 --> 42:33.375
You mustn't be angry with Rezo.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.500
He did the right thing, calling us.

42:37.083 --> 42:38.833
Didn't he?

42:39.416 --> 42:42.833
You know you can talk to us.

42:43.458 --> 42:47.458
It's our duty to help each other out
in times of need.

42:47.666 --> 42:51.541
Neither I, nor my husband, are in need.

42:51.750 --> 42:53.541
Please, don't worry.

42:54.208 --> 42:58.583
My dear, Soso is devastated.
He looks like a ghost.

42:58.750 --> 43:01.666
-I can't believe you don't see it.
-Mother.

43:01.916 --> 43:03.666
Don't interrupt me.

43:08.416 --> 43:10.500
I want to tell you one thing.

43:12.250 --> 43:16.041
I have recently turned 79.

43:17.166 --> 43:22.916
I have seen many things in my life.

43:23.083 --> 43:26.208
I can tell you one thing for sure.

43:28.458 --> 43:32.583
In this world, there are no families
without any problems.

43:32.791 --> 43:36.083
There are always problems. It's normal.

43:36.333 --> 43:38.416
Would you like a drink, Mr. Vazha?

43:41.333 --> 43:44.166
Of course, I have nothing to do with it...

43:45.291 --> 43:49.000
but it's a very complex situation.

43:54.375 --> 43:57.666
-I want to tell you something.
-Tell me.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.541
Think carefully.

44:01.250 --> 44:03.833
Think carefully twice.

44:05.583 --> 44:09.375
I want to tell you the same thing.
Think about this.

44:10.083 --> 44:12.708
Think over the steps you're taking.

44:13.083 --> 44:15.750
It's embarrassing for your family.

44:16.208 --> 44:18.833
Come on, Uncle Zaur, stop it.

44:21.166 --> 44:22.916
Manana, dear.

44:23.416 --> 44:26.875
You're at the age
where you should have a grandchild.

44:27.083 --> 44:29.208
It's no time for quarreling.

44:29.416 --> 44:33.208
Aunt Meri, it's my business
who I quarrel or make peace with.

44:33.416 --> 44:35.458
Uncle Zaur, could you please tell me

44:35.666 --> 44:38.250
how my behavior
is embarrassing to my family?

44:38.458 --> 44:42.166
-I didn't mean it.
-Then I don't understand.

44:42.333 --> 44:45.416
-Wait a minute.
-Rezo, wait, I'll talk to her.

44:48.375 --> 44:52.041
-What is it, Aunt Meri?
-I want to know...

44:52.333 --> 44:56.833
why you left your family?

44:57.541 --> 45:00.916
-I don't understand.
-What does it matter?

45:01.083 --> 45:05.583
You might not understand,
but I won't explain it to anyone.

45:05.791 --> 45:10.041
-Look at Ketino.
-What do I have to do with it?

45:10.250 --> 45:12.083
-She's not divorced.
-And?

45:12.291 --> 45:15.083
She has no children, she's educated.

45:15.291 --> 45:16.333
We know.

45:16.541 --> 45:18.291
With two diplomas.

45:18.500 --> 45:23.208
She's a great girl, but she is unmarried.

45:23.375 --> 45:26.125
Because it's very difficult, my dear.

45:26.375 --> 45:28.291
You have a good husband.

45:28.500 --> 45:33.166
I didn't know my husband
had so many fans among my relatives.

45:33.375 --> 45:37.041
Soso's a very good man.

45:37.250 --> 45:39.583
What can I say... You're so ungrateful.

45:39.791 --> 45:41.708
-Meri, stop it.
-Thank you.

45:41.875 --> 45:44.416
-Stop it, she gets it.
-Leave me alone.

45:44.625 --> 45:49.833
I wonder why she decided
to start a new life at this age.

45:50.041 --> 45:51.333
And who with.

45:51.541 --> 45:55.791
What are you talking about?
You're just imagining things now.

45:56.000 --> 45:58.333
I say you should take care of Soso.

45:58.541 --> 46:01.083
A man out of his mind
is capable of doing anything.

46:01.291 --> 46:04.041
He can look after himself.
He doesn't need you.

46:04.291 --> 46:07.625
You shouldn't drive a man
past breaking point.

46:07.833 --> 46:10.958
Are you all out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

46:11.166 --> 46:16.166
-What breaking point?
-Meri and Zaur, listen.

46:16.375 --> 46:20.166
Don't go out of your way
to stir up passions.

46:20.375 --> 46:23.666
Leave them alone.
They'll look after themselves.

46:23.875 --> 46:27.416
Wait, are you saying we have no say here?

46:27.625 --> 46:29.208
How is it your business?

46:29.375 --> 46:32.625
Leave her alone.
She understands what you're saying.

46:32.833 --> 46:34.208
Leave her alone.

46:34.416 --> 46:38.250
Listen, you're just kids
and don't understand many things.

46:38.458 --> 46:42.750
You mean I don't understand,
but Meri, Vazha and Zaur understand?

46:42.958 --> 46:45.166
How dare you call me Zaur? You rude boy.

46:45.375 --> 46:46.375
Stop it now.

46:47.583 --> 46:52.125
Thank you so much for taking care of me,
but I have to go now.

46:52.375 --> 46:54.583
Manana, don't be offended...

46:56.708 --> 46:59.375
Please, let there be no more quarreling.

46:59.583 --> 47:02.083
I'm fine, don't worry about me.

47:02.291 --> 47:03.875
Please call me.

48:38.791 --> 48:44.000
A bunch of coriander,
spinach and tarragon, please.

48:44.166 --> 48:45.208
I'll take it.

48:50.625 --> 48:51.625
Thank you.

48:54.458 --> 48:56.208
This piece, please.

49:06.875 --> 49:07.875
Nato.

49:08.166 --> 49:11.166
Hey, how are you?

49:11.333 --> 49:15.250
Oh, my dear!

49:15.458 --> 49:18.625
Long time no see.

49:18.833 --> 49:20.916
You look so well.

49:21.083 --> 49:23.750
-You look beautiful.
-Come on.

49:23.958 --> 49:26.958
She was my classmate.
I haven't seen her for ages.

49:27.166 --> 49:29.916
How are things? Are you still in Vedzisi?

49:30.083 --> 49:33.666
No, I sold that apartment long ago.
Come here, talk to me.

49:33.875 --> 49:37.583
-Why did you sell it?
-My husband fell into debt.

49:37.791 --> 49:41.000
I had a terrible time, but I got over it.

49:41.208 --> 49:43.583
-Where are you now?
-I was lucky...

49:44.041 --> 49:45.708
-I want this cheese.
-What?

49:45.916 --> 49:48.666
-I would like some cheese.
-Ask over there.

49:48.875 --> 49:50.583
-It's good, too.
-You're busy.

49:50.791 --> 49:54.791
-No, I haven't seen you for so long.
-What did you do then?

49:55.000 --> 50:00.458
My husband and I had no home,
then I went to Lilo.

50:00.666 --> 50:04.791
I bought a plot of land and a house.
I have a small farm now.

50:04.958 --> 50:07.833
-I started my own business.
-That's great.

50:09.166 --> 50:12.166
You just can't talk here.

50:13.083 --> 50:15.541
We're fine now. My husband got wiser.

50:15.750 --> 50:18.916
He helps me as much as he can.
How about you?

50:19.041 --> 50:20.875
-Still a teacher?
-Yes.

50:21.083 --> 50:23.875
How are your children? No coffee, thanks.

50:24.083 --> 50:25.416
My daughter got married.

50:25.625 --> 50:29.791
-My son is still young, he's 20.
-I saw Dalakishvili and Khoshtaria.

50:30.000 --> 50:32.166
-Really?
-Yes, they asked about you.

50:32.333 --> 50:34.875
-They wanted your phone number.
-Why?

50:35.083 --> 50:37.500
They want a class reunion in Tskneti.

50:37.666 --> 50:40.125
-At Museridze's.
-That's great.

50:40.375 --> 50:43.291
Do you know how long it's been
since we left school?

50:43.500 --> 50:45.125
-No idea.
-35 years.

50:45.375 --> 50:47.083
It's been so long.

50:47.291 --> 50:49.916
-How are the girls?
-Just great.

50:50.125 --> 50:53.250
They've always lived the high life.

50:53.458 --> 50:56.458
-They don't work here like me.
-Come on.

50:56.666 --> 50:58.708
-But I'm very happy.
-That's good.

50:58.916 --> 51:00.458
Of course.

51:01.208 --> 51:04.083
Can you take my phone out from my pocket?

51:04.458 --> 51:08.583
My hands are dirty.
Call yourself so I'll have your number.

51:37.166 --> 51:39.916
-Is everything OK?
-How are you?

51:40.875 --> 51:43.916
-Fine, and you?
-I'm well.

51:44.166 --> 51:48.916
I thought you were angry with me
and I decided to visit you.

51:49.750 --> 51:54.250
I also wanted to know where you live
and how you're doing. May I?

51:54.791 --> 51:56.208
Of course.

51:57.750 --> 52:00.875
-Will you show me the house?
-Yes, come.

52:02.083 --> 52:03.291
This is it.

52:03.791 --> 52:05.250
Fourth floor.

52:07.125 --> 52:08.250
No offense, but...

52:08.500 --> 52:11.375
do you think it's a good idea
to live in this hole?

52:11.666 --> 52:15.958
-Come on, don't start.
-How do you get to work from here?

52:16.166 --> 52:19.750
I get to work easily,
I use public transport.

52:20.416 --> 52:22.166
It's a good neighborhood.

52:23.833 --> 52:25.625
-Unbelievable.
-It is.

52:26.333 --> 52:28.250
The air is better here.

52:29.500 --> 52:30.875
I'll get some fruit.

52:31.083 --> 52:35.458
Mark my words,
you'll soon leave this place.

52:35.875 --> 52:37.166
Ok.

52:49.625 --> 52:50.666
Hello.

52:50.875 --> 52:53.750
-Kusho, what are you doing here?
-Rezo, how are you?

52:53.958 --> 52:55.166
My good man.

52:55.375 --> 52:58.416
-Do you live here?
-Yes, I moved here.

52:58.583 --> 53:01.375
-How are you doing?
-Up and down.

53:01.583 --> 53:03.958
He's a good man, Rezo.

53:04.833 --> 53:09.250
-How are your children?
-Growing up, you know how it is...

53:09.708 --> 53:12.750
My good man. It's good to see you.

53:12.958 --> 53:15.083
One minute, please. I'm sorry.

53:17.541 --> 53:20.541
-Is everything OK?
-Yes, sure.

53:21.041 --> 53:25.208
My sister moved here.
You know people here, don't you?

53:25.416 --> 53:29.083
-Yes, of course.
-She's alone now.

53:30.000 --> 53:33.875
She has some problems with her family.

53:34.083 --> 53:37.375
My brother-in-law is a very good man.

53:38.500 --> 53:40.333
Everything will be OK.

53:40.541 --> 53:42.875
There are so many assholes in this world.

53:43.083 --> 53:47.416
I don't want them to give her trouble.
That is what worries me.

53:56.958 --> 53:58.833
Come, the coffee is ready.

54:12.625 --> 54:15.000
Try it. The cake is delicious.

54:18.666 --> 54:22.958
I'm sure you'll get sick of it
soon enough.

54:23.166 --> 54:25.166
Come on.
Why do you wish bad things on me?

54:25.708 --> 54:27.458
I feel wonderful here.

54:30.666 --> 54:33.083
As you wish, Manana.

54:36.125 --> 54:38.791
-But you should know one thing.
-What?

54:39.333 --> 54:40.958
If you ever need me to...

54:41.791 --> 54:48.583
I'll come and pack your things,
and I'll carry all your things back home.

54:49.375 --> 54:52.583
I swear I won't hold it against you.

54:52.833 --> 54:53.833
Ok.

54:54.166 --> 54:58.666
If I decide to move, I'll call you,
but I'm not going anywhere.

54:58.875 --> 55:01.125
I am really happy here.

55:14.541 --> 55:15.791
Excuse me.

55:16.166 --> 55:18.500
I need guitar strings.
Where can I find some?

55:18.708 --> 55:20.375
-Down there.
-Thank you.

55:39.041 --> 55:41.291
-Is it seven string?
-Yes.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.958
I want the seventh string, if you have it.

55:44.166 --> 55:46.500
-Is this it?
-Yes, this, and that.

55:51.083 --> 55:52.083
I'll check.

55:58.000 --> 55:59.375
Very good.

56:01.208 --> 56:03.250
-How much is it?
-Two laris.

56:09.375 --> 56:10.708
Thank you very much.

56:15.958 --> 56:20.083
You have nothing to worry about.
Everything is in order.

56:20.291 --> 56:23.458
These kids amaze me.
They worry for no reason.

56:23.666 --> 56:25.333
Continue with the folic...

56:25.541 --> 56:26.958
Please show her in.

56:27.166 --> 56:29.583
Continue with folic acid.

56:30.500 --> 56:32.791
One pill of folic acid.

56:34.333 --> 56:35.583
Once a day.

56:37.458 --> 56:41.833
Healthy lifestyle.
Let's agree on what it means.

56:42.125 --> 56:44.458
Good food, fresh air...

56:52.583 --> 56:55.833
Is it normal that I'm not pregnant?
It's been a year.

56:56.041 --> 56:57.875
Could it be psychological?

56:58.625 --> 57:01.041
Come on, don't blow it out of proportion.

57:01.541 --> 57:03.416
What's the rush? It will happen.

57:03.666 --> 57:06.666
How long was it for you
after you got married?

57:07.208 --> 57:08.208
About six months.

57:08.416 --> 57:10.791
I'm telling you,
something's wrong with me.

57:11.041 --> 57:13.625
Nothing's wrong. What could be wrong?

57:15.916 --> 57:18.333
You should see things differently.

57:20.166 --> 57:23.958
It might be good
that you don't get pregnant.

57:24.166 --> 57:25.291
Why good?

57:25.791 --> 57:27.250
You're young.

57:27.458 --> 57:31.250
You could go somewhere,
to study or just travel.

57:31.458 --> 57:33.666
You don't need much money for that.

57:34.208 --> 57:36.708
You have plenty of time to have a baby.

57:37.250 --> 57:38.458
In the meantime...

57:40.041 --> 57:43.333
you and Vakho
will get to know each other better.

57:43.541 --> 57:45.208
You will know...

57:45.416 --> 57:47.916
whether
you are meant for each other or not.

57:48.000 --> 57:48.916
It takes time.

57:49.083 --> 57:54.333
Do you have any doubts about it?

57:54.500 --> 57:56.125
-No.
-I'll tell you what.

57:56.333 --> 57:58.500
You had problems with Dad and left him.

57:58.708 --> 58:00.500
It doesn't mean I should too.

58:00.666 --> 58:03.375
-I didn't mean that.
-You project onto others.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.791
-That's why you think so.
-Calm down.

58:05.958 --> 58:09.166
I've lived with him for a year
and I should get to know him better?

58:09.375 --> 58:11.666
Please, don't be angry.

58:12.000 --> 58:15.666
Don't interfere in my life.
I can go to the doctor myself, too.

58:15.875 --> 58:19.958
You're very negative and destructive.
You're like Otar.

58:20.250 --> 58:25.041
What's wrong with you?
I just want what's best for you.

58:25.291 --> 58:29.041
-Please, don't be angry.
-It's OK, forget it.

58:29.250 --> 58:30.875
Tell me how you are doing.

58:31.041 --> 58:33.208
How is the apartment?
Do you like it there?

58:41.375 --> 58:42.750
Come, come quickly.

01:01:10.083 --> 01:01:13.458
<i>The almond tree was blooming</i>

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:18.125
<i>The sun cast its reddish glow</i>

01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:23.375
<i>In the heart of almond tree flowers</i>

01:01:30.833 --> 01:01:34.291
<i>You came then</i>

01:01:36.291 --> 01:01:38.833
<i>And caressed me</i>

01:01:41.083 --> 01:01:44.333
<i>But I didn't believe</i>

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:47.666
<i>my love</i>

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:58.291
<i>See the almond tree blossomed</i>
<i>In my heart like it was yesterday</i>

01:02:02.625 --> 01:02:03.708
Thank you.

01:02:14.083 --> 01:02:16.333
Everyone will be there. Is it here?

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:20.375
-The air is so fresh here.
-No, I don't think it's here.

01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:22.250
Did we get out too early?

01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.958
No, it must be over there. Let's walk.

01:02:25.416 --> 01:02:28.041
-It's so nice here.
-It's been so long.

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:30.500
-My heart's pounding.
-I can imagine.

01:02:35.291 --> 01:02:36.750
-Manana?
-What?

01:02:36.958 --> 01:02:38.333
Can I ask you something?

01:02:38.541 --> 01:02:40.958
Don't tell anyone about the market.

01:02:41.166 --> 01:02:44.125
-What's wrong with the market?
-Nothing, but still...

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:47.541
Come on. Ok, as you wish.

01:02:48.791 --> 01:02:52.083
-Did they tell everyone?
-Yes, I think so.

01:02:52.416 --> 01:02:55.625
-Hey, girls.
-They came, they're here.

01:02:55.833 --> 01:02:58.333
Mkheidze and Ebanoidze.

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:00.750
I can't believe it.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.541
Manana, my dear. How I've missed you!

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:09.500
You look so beautiful.

01:03:16.958 --> 01:03:19.333
Put her down.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:23.791
Now it's my turn.

01:03:32.375 --> 01:03:34.750
Three cheers for our class, number 10B.

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:35.958
Hooray!

01:03:36.166 --> 01:03:38.250
-Hip hip...
-...hooray!

01:03:38.458 --> 01:03:40.416
-Hip hip...
-...hooray!

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:44.416
You've just drunk a toast to me.

01:03:45.333 --> 01:03:47.291
Now I propose a toast.

01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.375
Unfortunately...

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:56.875
some of your classmates
are not here with us today.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:03:58.083
Alas.

01:03:58.291 --> 01:04:02.166
Asatiani, Abuladze, Adamia...

01:04:02.625 --> 01:04:03.708
Okruashvili.

01:04:03.791 --> 01:04:04.750
Uchava.

01:04:05.416 --> 01:04:07.666
Uchava, my dears.

01:04:09.333 --> 01:04:13.166
Now, I want to drink a toast to you.

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:16.125
You must live.

01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:20.000
You must live
on behalf of those classmates.

01:04:20.458 --> 01:04:25.000
Live a long and happy life.
Cheers to you, kids.

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.250
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

01:04:28.541 --> 01:04:32.208
They were not ordinary guys.

01:04:32.875 --> 01:04:36.291
They could not reach the peak...

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.625
Could not get a foothold
in this whirl of life.

01:04:40.958 --> 01:04:42.916
So, they left us.

01:04:43.875 --> 01:04:45.333
God rest their souls.

01:04:45.583 --> 01:04:50.250
<i>I can be out of luck</i>

01:04:59.625 --> 01:05:05.666
<i>Misfortunes may befall me</i>

01:05:06.791 --> 01:05:09.458
<i>I will sing once again</i>

01:05:09.666 --> 01:05:15.000
<i>To feel joy in my heart</i>

01:05:15.875 --> 01:05:21.916
<i>Is it not better to have a rose</i>
<i>on your face than soot</i>

01:05:23.375 --> 01:05:27.875
<i>One is not a man who...</i>

01:05:38.916 --> 01:05:39.916
Great wine.

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:43.041
-No more for me, I'm drunk.
-Me too.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:46.583
It's her fault. She made me drink.
You're taking me home.

01:05:46.750 --> 01:05:50.958
-I told you I would.
-Tell me how you're doing.

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:54.541
-How are you? Your kids? Soso?
-We're fine.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:59.000
Was Soso angry that we met together
without our spouses?

01:05:59.208 --> 01:06:01.458
Don't worry. He has enough parties.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:06.916
-Let's not talk about men.
-They're like small children.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.791
-Is your daughter married?
-She is.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.958
-How old is she?
-23.

01:06:13.166 --> 01:06:16.041
-I can't believe it.
-But I'm not a grandma yet.

01:06:16.208 --> 01:06:18.166
It's too early to be grandmas.

01:06:19.875 --> 01:06:23.833
The boy is 20, he's a student.

01:06:24.416 --> 01:06:26.750
I've recently separated from Soso.

01:06:28.958 --> 01:06:31.500
I left the house and I live alone now.

01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:34.750
Manana, I can't believe it.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:40.250
-What are you saying?
-Recently, all I hear is bad news.

01:06:40.416 --> 01:06:43.041
I just can't believe it.

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:46.958
Wait, which house?
I know you lived with your mother.

01:06:47.166 --> 01:06:50.083
I no longer live there.
I live alone in an apartment.

01:06:50.250 --> 01:06:52.041
Did Soso buy another place?

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:56.625
No, he lives with my parents.
I rented an apartment.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.541
He stayed with them.

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:02.125
Why are you so surprised?

01:07:02.291 --> 01:07:04.958
Her parents raised Soso
as their own child.

01:07:05.166 --> 01:07:09.833
But I really feel good, girls.
I've always wanted to live alone.

01:07:10.458 --> 01:07:12.041
It feels really good.

01:07:12.208 --> 01:07:13.875
You'll reconcile, I know it.

01:07:14.083 --> 01:07:17.291
-No.
-Come on, don't say that.

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:21.541
-Wait. Does Soso work now?
-Yes, he works.

01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:25.000
-Did you quarrel?
-No, we didn't.

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:26.916
There were no quarrels or rows.

01:07:27.125 --> 01:07:28.708
Was he violent?

01:07:28.916 --> 01:07:32.916
-No, absolutely not.
-Come on, I know Soso well.

01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:38.500
How about the sex, was it OK?
Did he want anal sex?

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.875
Are you out of your mind?
What are you talking about?

01:07:42.083 --> 01:07:44.333
What? Haven't you heard of it?

01:07:45.083 --> 01:07:48.916
I know many women
whose husbands demand it.

01:07:49.125 --> 01:07:51.666
That's why Dundua divorced her husband.

01:07:52.125 --> 01:07:53.750
Unbelievable.

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:57.250
-Have you seen Museridze?
-He's outside.

01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:59.458
-I'm serious.
-Go outside.

01:07:59.666 --> 01:08:03.541
-Please... we're talking.
-Why are you acting like this?

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:10.541
-Tell me, how is Soso?
-Why should we worry about Soso?

01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:13.166
Soso's fine. He's getting used to it.

01:08:13.333 --> 01:08:15.875
You put up with a lot from him.

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:19.875
-I agree.
-Many women wouldn't have.

01:08:20.082 --> 01:08:21.291
What do you mean?

01:08:21.457 --> 01:08:26.750
Just imagine.
I wouldn't have put up with it.

01:08:26.957 --> 01:08:30.207
No offense, Manana.

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:33.207
I wouldn't put up with a man like Soso.

01:08:33.416 --> 01:08:36.750
-You're a saint.
-It's not like that.

01:08:36.957 --> 01:08:40.207
-What is it like, then?
-You know, for the family.

01:08:40.416 --> 01:08:45.082
Until the children grow up,
the financial situation...

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:48.750
One moment, please.
What you are talking about?

01:08:49.332 --> 01:08:51.082
-Doesn't she know?
-About what?

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:53.582
What do you expect?
Her head is in the clouds.

01:08:53.916 --> 01:08:56.291
Are you totally in the dark?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:59.541
Soso had an affair
with Tevdoradze's cousin.

01:08:59.750 --> 01:09:00.625
No!

01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.666
It happened a while back.
She had a boy with him.

01:09:03.832 --> 01:09:06.250
-No!
-Yes. He must be 13 now.

01:09:06.457 --> 01:09:09.000
-Or 14?
-Oh, my God.

01:09:09.207 --> 01:09:10.207
Oh yeah.

01:09:10.416 --> 01:09:13.625
Do the children keep in touch
with each other?

01:09:14.666 --> 01:09:16.832
I swear, I didn't know anything.

01:09:17.041 --> 01:09:21.207
Ok, enough. Why are you making
such a big deal of it?

01:09:21.666 --> 01:09:24.332
She divorced her husband, so what?
It's over now.

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:28.666
And she isn't interested
in who her husband had an affair with.

01:09:28.916 --> 01:09:31.666
-My nephew's in his class.
-And?

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:36.707
He looks so much like Soso.
He's a very sweet boy, slightly round.

01:09:36.875 --> 01:09:40.957
-It's not the boy's fault.
-What can Soso do about it?

01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:44.250
He cares for the boy as much as he can.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:48.000
-He left the woman a long time ago.
-And then?

01:09:48.207 --> 01:09:53.416
She was an evil woman. She made him
choose between her or his wife.

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:55.416
So he left her.

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:58.291
Poor Manana, you've gone through so much.

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.583
Soso loved that woman very much.

01:10:02.208 --> 01:10:05.666
Don't you remember?
He was often at the Tevdoradzes.

01:10:05.875 --> 01:10:09.875
-No, I don't remember.
-She had black, curly hair.

01:10:10.166 --> 01:10:13.291
-She was a pretty girl.
-I wouldn't call her pretty.

01:10:13.458 --> 01:10:16.875
-Why?
-I never liked her.

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:19.625
Calm down, pour me one.

01:10:19.833 --> 01:10:21.500
Let's drink to Manana.

01:10:21.708 --> 01:10:24.583
-Cheers.
-To Manana's new life.

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:29.291
-Manana, may you be happy.
-She will be happy.

01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:31.083
Of course.

01:10:31.375 --> 01:10:34.875
Oh, girls,
let me tell you about Chikovani.

01:10:35.083 --> 01:10:38.083
You will be so shocked.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:08.791
Did you know this, Manana?

01:11:44.458 --> 01:11:48.375
Girls... Madam. You promised me a song.

01:11:48.583 --> 01:11:51.458
-No, I can't sing right now.
-What?

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:55.875
Let's go.

01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:58.416
Let's go.

01:11:58.833 --> 01:12:00.375
David, come.

01:12:03.125 --> 01:12:04.375
Give it to me.

01:12:05.458 --> 01:12:07.291
Your reverence, bless us.

01:12:07.666 --> 01:12:08.666
Let's go.

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:13.458
Excuse me.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:18.916
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:22.291
My friends.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:25.958
Can I have your attention, please?

01:12:26.166 --> 01:12:27.791
-Now.
-I can't...

01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.666
-Our excellent student will sing.
-I can't sing.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:38.833
-Manana Mkheidze.
-I can't sing right now.

01:12:42.666 --> 01:12:44.291
I can't.

01:12:45.916 --> 01:12:47.541
Please sing.

01:12:47.750 --> 01:12:52.000
-We haven't heard you sing in years.
-Take it, Manana.

01:12:54.250 --> 01:13:00.458
-Sing, like you used to.
-We want to hear you sing, please.

01:13:00.666 --> 01:13:04.000
Go ahead, my dear, go on.

01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:05.208
No, I can't.

01:13:05.375 --> 01:13:08.250
-Please.
-Go on.

01:13:09.916 --> 01:13:11.875
One moment, please.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:23.666
You're such a darling. You're a wonder.

01:13:24.083 --> 01:13:27.000
<i>The mole on your face</i>

01:13:29.250 --> 01:13:34.416
<i>Suits you so much</i>
<i>Come and sit beside me</i>

01:13:35.166 --> 01:13:39.791
<i>Liven me up</i>
<i>You are so good</i>

01:13:40.541 --> 01:13:45.250
<i>Passionate and full of life</i>
<i>When I die, my dear</i>

01:13:45.875 --> 01:13:49.708
<i>You will become my tombstone</i>

01:13:53.333 --> 01:13:57.458
<i>You used to be my rose</i>
<i>But now you are my grief</i>

01:13:58.750 --> 01:14:02.875
<i>You avoid me and stay away from me</i>

01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:10.208
<i>Please tell me</i>

01:14:13.375 --> 01:14:16.583
<i>If someone else is better than me</i>

01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.208
<i>Without you my strength is gone</i>

01:14:26.583 --> 01:14:30.500
<i>If you did not know what love is</i>
<i>Why did you come to me?</i>

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:35.041
<i>Why did you walk my street at nights?</i>

01:14:53.791 --> 01:14:56.666
<i>The striped clothes</i>
<i>and the gown suit you</i>

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:03.583
<i>Boy, never think of betraying me</i>

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:08.666
<i>You are so good</i>
<i>So good</i>

01:15:09.208 --> 01:15:14.166
<i>Passionate and full of life</i>
<i>When I die, my dear</i>

01:15:14.666 --> 01:15:20.208
<i>Become a tombstone covering my grave</i>

01:18:44.166 --> 01:18:45.166
Who is it?

01:18:47.208 --> 01:18:48.916
-Gas service.
-Who?

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:50.791
Gas service.

01:18:55.708 --> 01:18:56.708
May I come in?

01:19:08.833 --> 01:19:11.291
-Where is the gas meter?
-Over here.

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:17.541
-Datuna, who is it?
-It's just the gas service.

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:20.208
Yeah, sure.

01:19:35.125 --> 01:19:36.666
It's there, madam.

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:45.708
-Hey.
-Aren't you coming down?

01:19:46.208 --> 01:19:51.750
-I can't be bothered.
-Damn, why are you so lazy?

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:14.833
Thank you, goodbye.

01:20:24.458 --> 01:20:25.583
One minute.

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:27.791
Excuse me, just a minute.

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:31.958
-Are you talking to me?
-Who else?

01:20:32.166 --> 01:20:33.875
Don't I have to sign something?

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:38.833
No, not you.
It's someone from the gas service.

01:20:43.333 --> 01:20:48.458
I wonder who his friends are.

01:20:48.666 --> 01:20:53.000
Does anyone know him at all?
I wonder what he wanted.

01:20:56.166 --> 01:20:57.375
Here, please.

01:20:58.791 --> 01:20:59.791
What?

01:21:00.208 --> 01:21:01.458
Where?

01:21:01.875 --> 01:21:03.833
Are you serious?

01:21:04.791 --> 01:21:05.916
And then?

01:21:07.333 --> 01:21:10.000
No, I didn't know.

01:21:12.083 --> 01:21:13.208
Yes, OK.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:16.500
Ok, wait a minute.

01:21:16.791 --> 01:21:17.791
Ok.

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:22.833
Wait. What are you doing?

01:21:24.916 --> 01:21:28.416
Put that bread and chocolate back.
Stop eating it now.

01:21:28.625 --> 01:21:30.083
But I'm hungry.

01:21:30.291 --> 01:21:33.166
If you're hungry, I'll fry some potatoes.

01:21:33.375 --> 01:21:37.125
-Leave me alone.
-What? Show this lady out.

01:21:38.708 --> 01:21:42.291
The boy drives me nuts.
I'm so angry with him.

01:21:42.541 --> 01:21:46.375
I think I should take him
to a nutritionist or psychologist.

01:21:46.583 --> 01:21:48.083
I should do something.

01:21:48.583 --> 01:21:51.666
He's gonna reach 100 kilos.
What will I do then?

01:21:55.166 --> 01:21:57.500
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

01:22:30.791 --> 01:22:31.791
Hi, Lasha.

01:22:35.125 --> 01:22:37.750
At home. Everything's fine. How are you?

01:22:41.208 --> 01:22:45.000
No, Lasha, I can't come now. What's wrong?

01:22:49.583 --> 01:22:54.000
I can't come now, I don't feel well.
Tell me what's wrong.

01:23:09.166 --> 01:23:10.708
Are they at home?

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:18.166
Ok, I'll come.

01:23:30.875 --> 01:23:33.416
What happened? What's going on?

01:23:39.041 --> 01:23:41.500
Father, what's wrong with you?

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:43.666
What happened?

01:23:44.625 --> 01:23:46.583
Will you tell me what happened?

01:23:49.958 --> 01:23:52.208
Nino threw a pan at Vakho.

01:23:52.541 --> 01:23:55.166
Vakho moved, and the pan hit Grandad.

01:23:55.458 --> 01:23:58.083
-What's wrong with your head?
-Nothing.

01:24:00.250 --> 01:24:03.125
How do you know that nothing's wrong?

01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:07.958
How dare you talk for others?

01:24:09.666 --> 01:24:13.291
-Calm down, Father.
-I survived the Communists.

01:24:13.500 --> 01:24:15.833
When KGB agents came for us...

01:24:16.583 --> 01:24:19.208
I was the only one
in my family to survive.

01:24:19.416 --> 01:24:22.666
I have survived
so many shitty governments.

01:24:23.166 --> 01:24:26.708
Now I have to put up with this government.

01:24:27.250 --> 01:24:29.958
And now my granddaughter
is trying to kill me.

01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:33.958
Calm down, she didn't mean to.
She's very sorry about it.

01:24:34.208 --> 01:24:38.625
-She has a lot on her plate.
-Don't I have enough on my plate?

01:24:40.333 --> 01:24:44.541
You ask God to kill you so often
that this is how he punished you.

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:48.958
I said I wanted to die.

01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:53.208
I never said

01:24:53.416 --> 01:24:56.750
that I wanted my granddaughter
to smash my head in.

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.791
Mother, where are the glasses?

01:25:01.625 --> 01:25:04.458
She put them there.

01:25:28.583 --> 01:25:30.291
How are you?

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.041
Fine.

01:25:36.875 --> 01:25:38.833
Are you having a rest from me?

01:25:53.125 --> 01:25:54.458
Are you settled in?

01:25:55.291 --> 01:25:56.958
As much as possible.

01:25:59.541 --> 01:26:02.958
The apartment is good.
I just need to put up shelves.

01:26:03.458 --> 01:26:06.083
All my things are on the floor.

01:26:15.666 --> 01:26:17.208
And you? How are you?

01:26:17.666 --> 01:26:20.541
-Does anyone want ice?
-Put one or two cubes in.

01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:22.458
I want ice, too.

01:26:23.291 --> 01:26:24.291
How am I?

01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:43.791
How do I know how I am?

01:26:48.375 --> 01:26:49.541
Are you drinking?

01:26:58.250 --> 01:27:03.250
-Take care of yourself.
-I'm OK, I feel well and healthy.

01:27:03.458 --> 01:27:05.041
My health is excellent.

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:07.083
Very good.

01:27:09.166 --> 01:27:10.541
Manana, listen.

01:27:12.666 --> 01:27:15.083
-I'll come and do the shelves.
-No.

01:27:15.250 --> 01:27:16.250
Listen.

01:27:17.083 --> 01:27:19.500
If you want, I can do it, no problem.

01:27:19.666 --> 01:27:22.041
No, Soso, it's OK.

01:27:47.791 --> 01:27:49.375
My girl.

01:27:50.708 --> 01:27:51.708
Don't cry.

01:27:55.291 --> 01:27:56.291
Sit down.

01:27:59.208 --> 01:28:02.666
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine, you'll see.

01:28:08.625 --> 01:28:11.708
Drink some water and don't cry, please.

01:28:13.208 --> 01:28:14.208
Drink.

01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:27.041
If I were pregnant,
everything would be better now.

01:28:27.250 --> 01:28:29.208
Please don't say that.

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.750
Calm down, my girl.

01:28:33.625 --> 01:28:35.958
You know I'd be happy
if you were pregnant.

01:28:36.208 --> 01:28:37.791
Everything will be fine.

01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:43.833
It hurts now, but after a while,
you'll see things differently.

01:28:48.416 --> 01:28:51.250
Everything will be fine.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:56.208
You're a beautiful...

01:28:57.541 --> 01:28:58.541
good girl...

01:29:00.250 --> 01:29:01.541
and young.

01:29:01.833 --> 01:29:04.125
You'll have so many suitors.

01:29:05.833 --> 01:29:09.541
You'll fall in love with someone
and have a baby with him.

01:29:11.625 --> 01:29:12.625
Come here.

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:07.750
Let me pass.

01:31:10.583 --> 01:31:14.125
-Help us. They'll be here soon.
-I'll be right there.

01:31:19.375 --> 01:31:23.250
-Lamara, where should I put this box?
-Put it on my head.

01:31:24.125 --> 01:31:27.083
Take that to your room
and put it in a drawer.

01:31:32.916 --> 01:31:34.791
What do you want, Otar?

01:31:37.208 --> 01:31:38.750
How can I help?

01:31:38.958 --> 01:31:42.625
Isn't it obvious? Look around.

01:31:43.000 --> 01:31:45.666
If you see things lying around,
put them away.

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:46.875
Oh, really?

01:31:50.458 --> 01:31:53.791
-The bell is ringing. Open the door.
-I'll get it.

01:31:59.916 --> 01:32:02.416
Lamara called me.
She said I should come right away.

01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:04.833
-It's OK, calm down.
-What happened?

01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:06.666
Lasha's getting married.

01:32:12.541 --> 01:32:14.166
Are you kidding?

01:32:17.333 --> 01:32:19.208
-Is he here?
-Not yet.

01:32:21.541 --> 01:32:22.541
Come.

01:32:23.291 --> 01:32:25.208
The lock is broken. My key doesn't work.

01:32:25.458 --> 01:32:27.500
It's not broken, we replaced it.

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:29.500
Why?

01:32:32.208 --> 01:32:34.750
Vakho has a key
and Nino doesn't want him here.

01:32:34.958 --> 01:32:36.625
That's why I replaced it.

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.625
-We have one for you, if you want it.
-Ok.

01:33:17.166 --> 01:33:18.500
Sweet mercy.

01:33:22.333 --> 01:33:24.708
I wonder if this girl has any parents.

01:33:25.375 --> 01:33:27.291
She has a mother, she's an only child.

01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:28.500
A mother?

01:33:29.083 --> 01:33:33.541
I wonder what her mother does,
if she's a decent woman...

01:33:33.958 --> 01:33:36.541
What do you mean by decent?

01:33:36.875 --> 01:33:39.208
Decent means decent.

01:33:39.625 --> 01:33:43.708
She's a medical assistant. She
works with Tsamalashvili's sister-in-law.

01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:45.583
-Right?
-Yes.

01:33:46.125 --> 01:33:49.166
-Don't you know this girl?
-Why would I?

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:51.750
-I don't know.
-How come?

01:33:51.958 --> 01:33:54.750
-Do I have to know everyone?
-Don't you?

01:34:00.083 --> 01:34:02.041
You almost gave me a heart attack.

01:34:02.208 --> 01:34:06.041
I thought someone died,
so I ran all the way here.

01:34:06.208 --> 01:34:09.625
And is it not heartbreaking?

01:34:10.333 --> 01:34:14.041
My heart breaks when I think
about who's joining our family,

01:34:14.208 --> 01:34:15.958
and she doesn't care.

01:34:16.166 --> 01:34:18.875
-She lives comfortably alone.
-Stop arguing, please.

01:34:19.125 --> 01:34:21.875
Stop now, it's not the time.

01:34:22.083 --> 01:34:24.208
-Hold your tongue.
-Stop it.

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:27.750
-They're here.
-Who will open the door?

01:34:27.958 --> 01:34:29.416
-I will.
-No, mother...

01:34:29.625 --> 01:34:32.083
It would be better if Nino opens it.

01:34:32.291 --> 01:34:34.583
-Let her open it.
-What's so bad about it?

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:36.416
Nothing mother, simply...

01:34:36.625 --> 01:34:38.708
Hi, Nino. This is Kitsi.

01:34:38.916 --> 01:34:40.791
-Nice to meet you.
-Come.

01:34:41.541 --> 01:34:43.541
-This is Kitsi.
-Hello.

01:34:43.750 --> 01:34:45.333
Nice to meet you.

01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.250
Hello, I'm Kitsi.

01:34:47.541 --> 01:34:49.625
-Mother.
-Hello.

01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:52.208
-Hello, I'm Kitsi.
-Lamara.

01:34:55.458 --> 01:34:58.375
Why is everyone standing?
Sit down, everyone.

01:34:58.791 --> 01:34:59.958
Kitsi, sit down.

01:35:01.958 --> 01:35:04.583
Give me your bag, I'll put it over here.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:12.291
It was torture.
We got stuck in traffic for an hour.

01:35:12.583 --> 01:35:14.583
Yes, it was a nightmare.

01:35:14.791 --> 01:35:16.875
Why didn't you call me? I'm here to help.

01:35:17.083 --> 01:35:19.500
It's OK, nothing important.

01:35:21.166 --> 01:35:22.583
I'm a bit confused now.

01:35:22.791 --> 01:35:25.208
I don't know how to put names to faces.

01:35:25.375 --> 01:35:26.583
It's OK, I'll tell you.

01:35:26.791 --> 01:35:29.000
-You are Soso, right?
-Yes.

01:35:29.208 --> 01:35:30.791
I'm the mother, Manana.

01:35:31.375 --> 01:35:33.625
-Grandmother.
-Mrs. Lamara.

01:35:33.833 --> 01:35:35.125
I know Otar.

01:35:37.125 --> 01:35:38.833
Nino, you look so familiar.

01:35:39.041 --> 01:35:41.125
That's what I thought.

01:35:41.333 --> 01:35:43.916
-But I can't remember from where.
-I wonder...

01:35:45.958 --> 01:35:47.458
-May I?
-Of course.

01:35:47.666 --> 01:35:49.583
Help yourself. It's all for you.

01:35:49.833 --> 01:35:53.916
May I ask you a question?

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:55.708
-Mother.
-Lamara, please...

01:35:55.958 --> 01:35:59.125
-What's wrong? Let me talk.
-Ask me anything you want.

01:35:59.291 --> 01:36:03.041
Is Kitsi your real name?

01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:07.041
-No, my real name is Tamuna.
-Thank goodness.

01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:11.333
Tamar, to be more exact.
But I really hate that name.

01:36:11.541 --> 01:36:15.875
If you call me Tamuna or Tamar,
I won't answer you.

01:36:16.041 --> 01:36:17.875
Why, my dear?

01:36:20.208 --> 01:36:21.541
It's true.

01:36:26.833 --> 01:36:28.875
This will be yours and Lasha's bedroom.

01:36:29.041 --> 01:36:31.541
It's not what it should be, but...

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:33.875
Are you kidding? It's great.

01:36:35.041 --> 01:36:38.250
The only bad thing in this room
is the wardrobe.

01:36:38.916 --> 01:36:43.708
It's so big we couldn't get it out,
so we all keep our clothes here.

01:36:44.083 --> 01:36:47.666
-Is it OK if I leave my stuff here?
-Of course. No problem.

01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:58.750
You can't imagine how happy I am
that we'll have a baby here soon.

01:36:58.958 --> 01:37:02.375
-You have such a cute bump.
-Thank you.

01:37:02.666 --> 01:37:04.208
Who is your doctor?

01:37:05.166 --> 01:37:08.833
I'm going to fry some potatoes,
make a salad.

01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:12.041
-And bake <i>Khachapuri.</i>
-Very good.

01:37:12.208 --> 01:37:16.625
I have a chicken, but it's frozen.

01:37:16.875 --> 01:37:20.875
-Let's buy something from the shop.
-No, let's use what we have.

01:37:21.083 --> 01:37:23.083
-It's embarrassing.
-Don't worry.

01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:37.583
Here's some watermelon.
It's sweet, help yourself.

01:37:53.958 --> 01:37:55.500
What are you doing out here?

01:37:56.583 --> 01:38:00.541
Could you ever imagine this?
We'll soon have a grandchild.

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:09.250
<i>The cherries</i>

01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:16.208
<i>Have ripened</i>

01:38:18.250 --> 01:38:21.208
<i>New juice</i>

01:38:22.750 --> 01:38:27.250
<i>Is dripping from the fern</i>

01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:34.000
<i>I didn't know, girl</i>
<i>That you were trembling then</i>

01:38:40.458 --> 01:38:45.333
<i>Your sparkling diamond eyes</i>
<i>Your shy sidesteps</i>

01:38:45.541 --> 01:38:52.416
<i>You gave yourself away</i>
<i>While I was picking leaves of...</i>

01:39:00.875 --> 01:39:03.833
-I'll go now.
-All right, darling.

01:39:08.291 --> 01:39:09.750
What are you doing?

01:39:10.541 --> 01:39:13.500
-What?
-You left without saying anything.

01:39:13.708 --> 01:39:15.583
I have to get up early tomorrow.

01:39:15.958 --> 01:39:18.083
I told Lasha I wouldn't stay for long.

01:39:18.291 --> 01:39:21.083
I'll give you a lift. Come and join us.

01:39:21.375 --> 01:39:24.583
Everyone's happier when you're here.
I'll give you a lift.

01:39:24.791 --> 01:39:26.958
How can you? You've been drinking.

01:39:27.166 --> 01:39:29.208
Only two glasses.

01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:33.000
-No, I'll take a taxi.
-Wait.

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.750
Take a taxi later.

01:39:36.333 --> 01:39:37.500
Please come.

01:39:38.041 --> 01:39:41.375
I'll put you in a taxi and take you home.

01:39:42.250 --> 01:39:46.333
Is our home so bad
that you can't spend an evening with us?

01:39:46.791 --> 01:39:49.416
I swear, if it's late,
I'll put you in a taxi

01:39:49.625 --> 01:39:51.083
and I'll go straight home.

01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:53.208
Why should you take me? I'm not scared.

01:39:53.416 --> 01:39:54.458
Of course.

01:39:55.208 --> 01:39:58.583
You aren't scared of anything.
You're a tough girl.

01:39:59.541 --> 01:40:00.541
I must go.

01:40:05.416 --> 01:40:06.416
Wait, please.

01:40:09.125 --> 01:40:10.833
You know, I wonder...

01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.583
-What is it?
-When will you come back?

01:40:14.458 --> 01:40:16.583
You see, I say nothing...

01:40:17.458 --> 01:40:20.166
I say nothing and wait for you.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.916
But you know, it isn't easy.

01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:26.958
-Are you waiting for me?
-Of course.

01:40:29.041 --> 01:40:32.625
I have my own home,
and I'm not going to come back.

01:40:33.541 --> 01:40:36.250
What am I supposed to do? Where's my home?

01:40:36.875 --> 01:40:39.416
Where is my place?

01:40:40.500 --> 01:40:41.625
Ok, I can go.

01:40:41.916 --> 01:40:47.125
It's no problem.
I can live wherever I want.

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:48.708
-Yes.
-But...

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:54.708
Until now I thought it was my home,
that it was where I belonged.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:41:01.041
That you were my home,
and Lasha, Nino, Lamara and Otar too.

01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:05.875
-Go home then. They're waiting for you.
-You really are a piece of work.

01:41:06.083 --> 01:41:08.625
-Why must everything be your way?
-That's not true.

01:41:08.833 --> 01:41:12.250
-Ok, I won't say anything.
-Please, I need to get up early.

01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:17.458
-Please go back.
-Can't I even walk you to a taxi?

01:41:18.083 --> 01:41:19.250
Ok.

01:41:44.291 --> 01:41:45.958
Hey, we want to go to Varketili.

01:41:46.250 --> 01:41:48.083
-Ok.
-Here's the money.

01:41:51.666 --> 01:41:54.250
-What?
-What about the shelves?

01:41:54.458 --> 01:41:56.458
-What shelves?
-In your apartment.

01:41:56.666 --> 01:42:00.041
I've not done them yet.
I'll put them up as soon as I can.

01:42:00.208 --> 01:42:02.125
I'm going. Take care.

01:42:42.875 --> 01:42:46.000
-It's you, come in.
-How are you?

01:42:46.208 --> 01:42:48.833
-Ok. And you?
-Fine.

01:42:50.833 --> 01:42:52.791
-Did you find it easily?
-Of course.

01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.583
-Your coat?
-No thanks. This is for you.

01:42:57.208 --> 01:42:59.208
You really shouldn't have.

01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.583
Come in.

01:43:07.708 --> 01:43:10.333
It will fit here, too. You can move this.

01:43:10.583 --> 01:43:14.291
One here, the other there,
or next to each other, maybe...

01:43:15.833 --> 01:43:17.500
I think it's better there.

01:43:18.666 --> 01:43:19.833
As you wish.

01:43:20.458 --> 01:43:22.291
Ok then, I'll start.

01:43:22.833 --> 01:43:25.708
Wait, take a breath. Are you in a hurry?

01:43:25.916 --> 01:43:30.416
-No, I'm not in a hurry.
-Come see the rest of the apartment.

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.333
This is the other room.

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:51.500
It's really nice.

01:43:52.291 --> 01:43:54.083
Yes, I've got used to it.

01:43:55.208 --> 01:43:57.416
It's not big, but it's cozy.

01:43:58.541 --> 01:44:00.208
I'll show you the kitchen.

01:44:02.666 --> 01:44:06.875
It was so messy when I moved in.
I've been cleaning it ever since.

01:44:07.333 --> 01:44:09.416
It looks neat now.

01:44:14.333 --> 01:44:15.333
What is this?

01:44:15.541 --> 01:44:18.000
It's home-made wine,
my friends gave it to me.

01:44:18.208 --> 01:44:20.916
It's young wine.
I thought you might like it.

01:44:21.416 --> 01:44:22.416
Thank you.

01:44:27.375 --> 01:44:28.375
What are these?

01:44:32.625 --> 01:44:35.625
Tomatoes. I planted them
and now they've grown.

01:44:37.833 --> 01:44:38.833
That's great.

01:44:42.666 --> 01:44:44.750
Will you have something to eat?

01:44:46.708 --> 01:44:48.416
If you're offering, I will.

01:44:48.625 --> 01:44:51.208
I've cooked. Nothing special, but...

01:44:51.583 --> 01:44:53.375
I've been at home all day.

01:44:54.375 --> 01:44:55.833
So I cooked something.

01:44:58.875 --> 01:45:00.375
It smells wonderful.

01:45:00.958 --> 01:45:02.416
It will be ready soon.

01:45:03.375 --> 01:45:05.833
-I'll go and start then.
-Ok.

01:45:21.583 --> 01:45:22.583
It's ready.

01:45:29.958 --> 01:45:32.916
-This is a feast.
-It's nothing special.

01:45:50.333 --> 01:45:52.291
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

01:46:00.541 --> 01:46:02.041
I'll drink to you.

01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:05.666
Wherever you are.

01:46:08.083 --> 01:46:09.083
Thank you.

01:46:09.958 --> 01:46:11.083
Cheers.

01:46:19.041 --> 01:46:23.000
-The wine is quite good, isn't it?
-Very good wine.

01:46:26.208 --> 01:46:27.333
Have some.

01:46:32.041 --> 01:46:33.916
I think it's pretty good.

01:46:35.875 --> 01:46:37.708
Have some corn bread.

01:46:41.250 --> 01:46:42.625
And some of this.

01:46:45.833 --> 01:46:48.916
It's not quite as good as Lamara's, but...

01:46:50.208 --> 01:46:51.583
It's very good.

01:46:52.791 --> 01:46:54.416
-Is it?
-Yes, really.

01:46:59.875 --> 01:47:01.375
How are things at home?

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:03.625
How are Lamara and Otar?

01:47:04.166 --> 01:47:05.250
As usual.

01:47:07.958 --> 01:47:10.041
Lamara is fine, in good health.

01:47:14.541 --> 01:47:17.791
Otar no longer speaks about death so much.

01:47:19.375 --> 01:47:22.000
He's happy,
waiting for his great-grandchild.

01:47:22.208 --> 01:47:24.250
-So everything's good.
-Great.

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:30.625
-How about Lasha and Kitsi?
-They're fine.

01:47:36.541 --> 01:47:37.916
Well...

01:47:40.625 --> 01:47:42.458
Kitsi is a very good child.

01:47:43.000 --> 01:47:45.625
-She's a very good girl.
-Yes.

01:47:45.916 --> 01:47:49.708
Sometimes I think,
why on earth did she marry him?

01:47:50.708 --> 01:47:54.958
Maybe he isn't as bad as you think.
Is he still glued to the computer?

01:47:55.166 --> 01:47:57.083
Not so much. He goes out a bit.

01:47:57.958 --> 01:48:02.416
I think he's looking for a job.
I don't know, he won't tell me.

01:48:02.625 --> 01:48:05.833
He won't tell anyone.
It was Kitsi who told me.

01:48:10.041 --> 01:48:13.208
How is Nino? Has she got over it?

01:48:16.041 --> 01:48:18.416
Yes, I think so.

01:48:19.833 --> 01:48:24.833
She had some friends over recently.
They had fun, cheered her up.

01:48:25.041 --> 01:48:28.416
Kitsi joined them, too.
They had a great time.

01:48:33.666 --> 01:48:36.250
-Has Vakho turned up?
-Vakho?

01:48:38.083 --> 01:48:41.791
I'll break his head
if I ever see him, that bastard.

01:48:42.333 --> 01:48:43.333
Come on.

01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.458
It's getting colder, at last.

01:49:05.875 --> 01:49:07.416
How are you doing?

01:49:11.208 --> 01:49:12.500
How is your life?

01:49:15.041 --> 01:49:16.291
What can I say...?

01:49:19.791 --> 01:49:21.083
-Hello, madam.
-Hello.

01:49:21.291 --> 01:49:23.666
Excuse me. Could you call your guest?

01:49:23.916 --> 01:49:25.708
We're your neighbors.

01:49:26.208 --> 01:49:27.541
-Hello, sir.
-Hello.

01:49:27.750 --> 01:49:29.833
-A moment?
-Is my car blocking yours?

01:49:30.041 --> 01:49:31.458
-Yes.
-I'll move it then.

01:49:31.666 --> 01:49:33.041
I'll come now.

01:49:33.208 --> 01:49:35.000
-Sorry about this.
-Not at all.

01:49:35.166 --> 01:49:39.083
-I'm very sorry about this.
-It's not the car that's the problem.

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:40.375
Then what is it?

01:49:40.583 --> 01:49:43.041
Listen, bro, we have a favor to ask.

01:49:43.208 --> 01:49:44.208
What is it?

01:49:44.416 --> 01:49:47.458
I don't want you
disturbing this lady again.

01:49:47.708 --> 01:49:49.333
What?

01:49:49.708 --> 01:49:51.625
What are you laughing at, man?

01:49:52.125 --> 01:49:54.250
-What's your name?
-Irakli.

01:49:54.458 --> 01:49:57.500
Are you looking for trouble, son?

01:49:58.083 --> 01:50:00.083
Listen.

01:50:00.750 --> 01:50:03.458
That's a married woman in there.

01:50:03.958 --> 01:50:06.875
Did you know she has a husband and family?

01:50:07.875 --> 01:50:09.125
Did you know that?

01:50:09.791 --> 01:50:11.375
Did you know you're cute?

01:50:11.583 --> 01:50:14.083
-Get your hands off me.
-Or what?

01:50:14.291 --> 01:50:17.666
You goon, you should talk
to adults with more respect.

01:50:17.875 --> 01:50:21.583
How dare you talk to me like that?
Who are you, anyway?

01:50:21.791 --> 01:50:24.791
-What's this? What's going on?
-Let me handle it.

01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:28.291
-What do you want with my husband?
-He's your husband?

01:50:28.500 --> 01:50:29.958
Yes, he's my husband.

01:50:30.125 --> 01:50:32.125
Are you Rezo's brother-in-law?

01:50:32.541 --> 01:50:34.083
The good man?

01:50:34.500 --> 01:50:38.083
-Did Rezo send you?
-Don't you people have any shame?

01:50:38.291 --> 01:50:40.958
He's such a fool.

01:50:41.125 --> 01:50:43.458
-What the hell?
-Sorry.

01:50:43.708 --> 01:50:45.666
You should be.

01:50:45.833 --> 01:50:48.708
-Let's go.
-Your behavior is outrageous.

01:50:48.875 --> 01:50:50.708
Rezo asked us to watch over you.

01:50:50.916 --> 01:50:54.791
I don't need watching over.
I'm not a child who misbehaved.

01:50:54.958 --> 01:50:57.208
We know who's who now, so let's split.

01:50:57.416 --> 01:50:59.750
Ok, goodbye.

01:50:59.958 --> 01:51:03.541
If Rezo told you to jump in a river,
would you do that?

01:51:03.791 --> 01:51:05.833
We are sorry.

01:51:06.041 --> 01:51:08.291
-Don't you have any brains?
-Ok, let's go.

01:51:08.541 --> 01:51:12.625
What's Rezo up to?
How dare he treat me like that?

01:51:13.083 --> 01:51:16.583
How dare he speak about me to those fools?

01:51:16.833 --> 01:51:19.625
He acts like a child. He never grew up.

01:51:19.791 --> 01:51:21.208
He interferes with my life.

01:51:21.416 --> 01:51:24.041
-Ok, calm down.
-How can I calm down?

01:51:24.291 --> 01:51:27.541
-Do you think it's OK?
-No, I don't.

01:51:28.041 --> 01:51:30.500
Did you hear what they said?
Watch over me?

01:51:30.666 --> 01:51:32.583
I don't need them watching over me.

01:51:32.791 --> 01:51:37.083
I didn't want to deal with those guys.
I'll talk to Rezo about it.

01:51:37.250 --> 01:51:40.250
I'm so tired, Soso.
I don't need such a family.

01:51:40.458 --> 01:51:42.125
Nor do I need such a brother.

01:51:42.333 --> 01:51:44.625
Come on, Manana, you know how he is.

01:51:44.791 --> 01:51:47.541
This is how he operates.
It's how he's lived his life.

01:51:47.750 --> 01:51:51.291
You understand him, don't you?
Let me through.

01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:56.125
I just mean you don't have
to be upset about it.

01:51:56.291 --> 01:51:59.583
-Calm down.
-"It's how he's lived his life."

01:51:59.958 --> 01:52:01.541
So what should I do, then?

01:52:03.208 --> 01:52:05.041
-And you?
-Me?

01:52:05.333 --> 01:52:07.166
How have you lived your life?

01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:09.583
Do you know it all?

01:52:10.416 --> 01:52:11.875
Who are you?

01:53:52.916 --> 01:53:57.416
