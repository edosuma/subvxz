WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.804
Lady Luck
is on your side
from LA to Vegas.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.507
What, are you gonna put
a sock on the cockpit door?
Don't cockpit-block me.

00:06.540 --> 00:07.908
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:07.941 --> 00:09.543
And check out
our other Fox programs,

00:09.577 --> 00:11.645
The Mick, The Last Man on Earth,

00:11.679 --> 00:12.846
and Brooklyn Nine-Nine.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.182
The kids are gonna love it.

00:14.215 --> 00:15.349
Only on Fox.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.822
Hey, thanks for coming early.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.824
We are in crisis mode.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.693
Dave is fresh off his breakup
with Patricia,

00:25.726 --> 00:27.595
and post-breakup Dave
is the worst Dave there is.

00:27.628 --> 00:28.762
I thought "Hold the phone,

00:28.796 --> 00:29.863
you've never heard
of Fleetwood Mac?" Dave

00:29.897 --> 00:31.499
was the worst Dave.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.834
No, "I'm not a racist, but..."
Dave is the worst Dave.

00:33.867 --> 00:34.935
I'm not a particular fan

00:34.968 --> 00:36.770
of "You were in my dream
last night" Dave.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.672
The only Dave I don't like
is Dave Matthews.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.241
It's like,
"Ugh, finish the song."

00:40.274 --> 00:41.375
What's in the bag?

00:41.409 --> 00:43.411
Stuff to help him through this.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.246
He's gonna be a mess,
and it's up to us to get him

00:45.279 --> 00:46.514
back on his feet.
Colin, you give him those.

00:46.547 --> 00:49.250
-Dave loves...
-Oh, these are disgusting.

00:49.283 --> 00:51.152
...to smell them.
They're decorative soaps.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.788
And this is
Unlikely Animal Friends,

00:54.822 --> 00:57.191
a photo book
of interspecies animals cuddling

00:57.225 --> 00:58.392
to restore his faith in love.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.927
Oh, I have similar book,

00:59.960 --> 01:02.029
but it's a cookbook.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.231
Nichole,

01:03.264 --> 01:04.598
here are giant sunglasses

01:04.632 --> 01:06.534
so Dave can hide his puffy eyes
from all the crying.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.568
What am I giving him?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.203
You just have to pretend
to care.

01:09.237 --> 01:10.271
Ronnie,
it's not called "pretend"

01:10.304 --> 01:11.372
when you're classically trained.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.540
It's called "technique."

01:12.573 --> 01:14.108
Oh! Okay, uh, here he comes.

01:14.142 --> 01:16.644
Everybody get ready.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.414
Hey, nerds.
What are we smiling at?

01:20.448 --> 01:23.251
David, I know
this breakup was tough.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.485
But I'm here for you.

01:24.518 --> 01:26.587
When you hurt, I hurt.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.721
Guys, I appreciate it,

01:27.755 --> 01:28.889
but the breakup
is already behind me.

01:28.922 --> 01:29.990
I'm really okay.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.091
See you on board.

01:31.125 --> 01:32.993
Wow.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.062
I did not expect him
to bounce back so quickly.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.330
Do we really think he's okay?

01:36.364 --> 01:38.499
Who cares? I just left it all
out on the stage,

01:38.532 --> 01:40.568
and for what? A pat on the back
and "see you on board"?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.969
What a waste
of a brave performance.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.337
I'll be in my dressing room.

01:43.371 --> 01:45.906
He has a dressing room?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.276
Oh, that's what he calls
every bathroom he goes into.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.410
PILOT :
Jackpot Airlines.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.312
Northeast-bound to Las Vegas.

01:51.345 --> 01:54.315
*

02:00.120 --> 02:01.422
Nichole,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.090
I need to talk to you
about something,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.258
and I haven't told anyone yet.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.527
It's okay.
I saw you sneeze into a pillow

02:06.560 --> 02:08.962
and give it to that guy.
We all have hard days at work.

02:08.996 --> 02:11.265
Oh, no, that was intentional.
He told me I looked tired.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.667
-Rude.
-So, Bryan asked me
to move in with him.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.968
Oh, my God, that's so great.

02:15.002 --> 02:16.504
I mean, I get that offer
all the time,

02:16.537 --> 02:18.606
but I'm not about to break up
Dirk Nowitzki's marriage.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.774
Our lives are different.

02:20.808 --> 02:22.776
Look, I've never
lived with anyone.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.445
How do I know if I'm even ready?

02:24.478 --> 02:26.880
This is a huge decision, and
I'm gonna see him this weekend.

02:26.914 --> 02:28.115
I have to tell him something.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.318
Okay, I get it. This is big.

02:30.351 --> 02:31.985
How do you normally make
big life decisions?

02:32.019 --> 02:33.954
-Quickly and panicked.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.889
Not great.
You want to buy a moped?

02:35.923 --> 02:37.625
First thing you need to do
is make a pro/con list.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.159
I do them for just
about everything.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.294
"Should I dye my hair blonde?

02:40.328 --> 02:41.629
"Should I quit social media?

02:41.662 --> 02:42.730
Should I run for senate?"

02:42.763 --> 02:44.465
-Ow!
-Oh, I'm sorry.

02:44.498 --> 02:45.899
Did you want to help me
with the drink service,

02:45.933 --> 02:48.302
or stay here and play grab-ass
with your little friend?

02:52.873 --> 02:57.010
Artem, I'm not sure
how much longer I can do this.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.479
Oh, the fake English accent?

02:58.512 --> 02:59.647
Just drop it.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.981
We like you for you, man.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.816
No, this L.A. to Vegas commute.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.984
It's killing me.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.019
I don't understand
the allure of this city.

03:06.053 --> 03:08.822
There's something
for everybody in Vegas.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.359
And if you are put
in the right situation,

03:11.392 --> 03:13.894
you would realize
there's more Vegas in you

03:13.927 --> 03:16.063
than you ever imagined.

03:16.096 --> 03:18.332
I think it's fair to say
there's not an ounce of Vegas

03:18.366 --> 03:19.500
in me right now.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.269
Oh, yes, there is.

03:21.302 --> 03:24.071
I see it so clearly now,

03:24.104 --> 03:26.307
as I can see
how you're gonna die.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.777
Natural causes.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.047
I'm really proud of how you're
handling this breakup, Dave.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.048
You're my hero.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.217
Thanks, Alan. I'm my hero, too.

03:37.251 --> 03:39.553
You know, there's a term
for my evolution.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.389
It's called "emotional growth."

03:41.422 --> 03:43.724
I'm at a point in my life
where I give myself permission

03:43.757 --> 03:47.361
to feel what I'm feeling
and just let it go.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.030
If you started a cult, I would
leave mine and join yours.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.865
Don't leave your cult for me.

03:51.899 --> 03:53.233
You love Weight Watchers.

03:53.267 --> 03:56.069
Okay, so what
are we plugging today?

03:57.271 --> 04:00.541
Hey there, folks,
Captain Dave here.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.709
You smell that?

04:01.742 --> 04:03.210
That's love in the air.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.312
And if you're feeling ready
to make

04:04.345 --> 04:06.113
that special relationship
official,

04:06.146 --> 04:07.948
head on down to Wed-Locked,

04:07.981 --> 04:11.785
Vegas' first escape room...
slash...

04:11.819 --> 04:14.955
wedding chapel.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.724
Oh, God.

04:18.859 --> 04:22.463
Folks, I'm gonna
go off-script here

04:22.496 --> 04:24.131
and get real with you.

04:24.164 --> 04:27.234
You know,
I used to believe in love.

04:27.267 --> 04:29.169
Then I realized love sucks.

04:29.202 --> 04:31.238
It's a total waste of time.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.239
I'm done with it.

04:32.272 --> 04:33.307
Artem, I need that book.

04:33.341 --> 04:34.675
DAVE:
Done.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.245
-I don't need love anymore.
-Come on, Dave, let me in.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.748
Lots of people don't have love,
and they're doing great.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.782
Like my friend Colin.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.584
The pale gentleman
in the tweed jacket.

04:43.617 --> 04:47.087
He has the air of a widower,
but really, he's just divorced.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.255
Hey, Colin,

04:48.288 --> 04:50.090
let's you and me
disappear into the woods

04:50.123 --> 04:51.992
and live off the land,
sustaining ourselves

04:52.025 --> 04:54.528
on our shared hatred of romance.

04:54.562 --> 04:55.796
Look at this one, Dave.

04:55.829 --> 04:58.632
It's a German Shepherd
and a baby owl.

04:58.666 --> 05:01.101
He should be eating him,
but they're touching noses.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.371
So, to sum it all up, folks,

05:03.404 --> 05:05.205
I hate love.

05:06.474 --> 05:09.309
I don't need it,
and neither does Colin.

05:09.343 --> 05:11.278
-Right.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.381
Just to be clear,
Captain Dave and I

05:13.414 --> 05:15.549
are on very different
emotional paths.

05:15.583 --> 05:19.019
I'm not that lonely,
I just like to read books.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.822
: Ay, Papi.
-Come on, mate.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.896
What the hell was that, Dave?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.298
That was a punch in the face
called "truth."

05:31.331 --> 05:33.233
And your first taste
of the new me.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.235
It might get bitter.

05:35.268 --> 05:37.070
Yeah?

05:37.104 --> 05:38.906
That's it.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.174
So it looks like our flight
to L.A. is going to be delayed.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.876
Apparently, there's a warning
light on in the cockpit

05:42.910 --> 05:44.044
they need to check out.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.846
Do you know anything
about this, Dave?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.183
-MALE VOICE: Warning. Warning.

05:50.217 --> 05:51.852
Nope.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.854
Look, I know
you're hurting right now,

05:53.887 --> 05:55.589
but you've got
to pull it together.

05:55.623 --> 05:56.857
You have a job to do,

05:56.890 --> 05:58.358
so while they're fixing
this warning light,

05:58.392 --> 06:01.061
why don't you go blow off some
steam and get your head right?

06:01.094 --> 06:02.496
I'm gonna go to Hudson News

06:02.530 --> 06:05.098
and tip over a rack
of Nora Roberts novels.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.701
If I can't have romance,
no one can.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.203
Bernard.

06:10.237 --> 06:12.740
I should have known
you were behind this delay.

06:12.773 --> 06:16.176
Caroline, I knew I caught a waft
of soup breath and eczema cream.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.713
Listen, you sour-faced Contempo
Casuals mannequin come to life,

06:19.747 --> 06:22.082
the gate agents are not taking
the fall for this mess

06:22.115 --> 06:23.884
because you two screwed up.

06:23.917 --> 06:26.019
You look like a moray eel
with a wig.

06:26.053 --> 06:28.956
You look like a Snapchat filter
called "Ugly Tyrese."

06:28.989 --> 06:31.525
O-Okay, guys,
let's not do this again.

06:31.559 --> 06:32.926
Come on,
we're all in it together.

06:32.960 --> 06:34.562
The plane will be fixed soon.

06:34.595 --> 06:38.398
So, until then,
hands in, go team.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.567
Know this, Bernard.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.368
I'm going to get you.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.471
And your little dog, too.

06:45.272 --> 06:47.240
Why does she hate us so much?

06:47.274 --> 06:49.376
It's probably because
I slept with her boyfriend.

06:49.409 --> 06:52.613
I didn't want to,
but I could, so I did.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.050
Oh, hey.

06:57.084 --> 06:59.419
Look what the Kat Dennings
dragged in.

06:59.453 --> 07:01.088
What are you still doing here?

07:01.121 --> 07:02.890
It seems my ex took
my son to Phoenix

07:02.923 --> 07:04.658
to visit her mum
without telling me.

07:04.692 --> 07:08.295
So, apparently, I just flew to
Vegas to use an airport toilet.

07:08.328 --> 07:09.763
What are you still doing here?

07:09.797 --> 07:13.734
I'm gonna get a ride as soon
as Serge pricing goes down.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.469
How about now, Serge?

07:15.503 --> 07:16.904
Mm-mmm.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.773
Hey, Captain Dave.

07:19.807 --> 07:22.943
The sadness
that is usually on the inside

07:22.976 --> 07:25.445
is now on outside.

07:25.479 --> 07:26.914
Ronnie said that
the flight is delayed

07:26.947 --> 07:28.281
and I should
blow off some steam,

07:28.315 --> 07:29.583
but I don't know how to do it.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.752
Everything reminds me
of Patricia, even you guys.

07:31.785 --> 07:35.122
Artem, your long,
beautiful hair.

07:35.155 --> 07:37.858
Colin, your soft,
feminine bone structure.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.960
Captain, I know what you need.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.630
Let me take you
to a very special place,

07:42.663 --> 07:44.364
a place where you can think,

07:44.397 --> 07:46.867
reflect and relax.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.269
A casino?

07:49.302 --> 07:51.038
This is where you go
to think and reflect?

07:51.071 --> 07:53.106
Yeah, just listen.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.475
It's like a thousand game shows
having an orgy.

07:55.509 --> 07:58.979
Exactly. Everything in here
is designed to distract you

07:59.012 --> 08:01.481
from thinking
about anything else.

08:01.515 --> 08:05.352
All that matter is right
in front of you, Captain Dave.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.821
What do you say?
Just one roll?

08:07.855 --> 08:09.790
And see where it takes you.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.825
CROUPIER:
Shooter's up.

08:15.028 --> 08:18.131
-Seven. Winner.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.633
Let's do it again.

08:19.667 --> 08:23.170
Now, wait. We must adhere
to the powers of superstition.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.405
Colin, what were you doing
just before he rolled?

08:25.438 --> 08:27.240
Just leaning on the table
and taking a drink.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.544
Then you do exactly that
and I stand here looking cool

08:30.578 --> 08:32.479
because that's what I was doing.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.985
CROUPIER:
Yo, 11. Winner.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.053
-Come on.

08:40.087 --> 08:41.689
Looks like we're staying.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.858
Hey, Serge, you can leave.

08:44.892 --> 08:49.096
Okay. Moving in with Bryan,
pro/con list, page three.

08:49.129 --> 08:51.832
Pro: Bryan is super thoughtful.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.000
He said if we lived together,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.167
he would keep
his fancy wine fridge

08:54.201 --> 08:55.402
stocked with cheap beer for me.

08:55.435 --> 08:57.738
-Aw. He's not gonna change
your trashy.
-Mm-hmm.

08:57.771 --> 09:01.709
Con: Sometimes he wears
this Lenny Kravitz-y scarf

09:01.742 --> 09:02.876
he thinks is cool.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.578
It's a grievance,
not a deal breaker.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.013
He knitted it himself.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.215
Keep reading.

09:08.248 --> 09:10.918
Pro: He has fancier shampoo
than me,

09:10.951 --> 09:12.786
and I can use it every day.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.888
Con: He has fancier shampoo
than me.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.857
Okay, Ronnie, we've been at this
for 30 minutes,

09:16.890 --> 09:18.058
and I got to say,

09:18.091 --> 09:19.727
you haven't listed
one real reason

09:19.760 --> 09:21.294
why you shouldn't
move in with Bryan.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.264
Okay. What about Bernard?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.266
He would be devastated
if I left.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.467
I'd be fine if you left.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.402
Won't you miss
my Sunday morning pancakes?

09:29.436 --> 09:30.537
Those were pancakes?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.706
I guess we can cross
Bernard being devastated

09:32.740 --> 09:34.407
off your con list.

09:34.441 --> 09:36.476
Sorry to interrupt
your Mensa meeting,

09:36.509 --> 09:38.478
but we fixed
the warning light issue,

09:38.511 --> 09:41.214
so I hope you sky trash
are ready to go.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.951
Oh, I'm ready to go...
after your next boyfriend.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.118
This time make it
a straight one.

09:45.152 --> 09:46.553
Give me a challenge.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.321
Okay, enough.

09:48.355 --> 09:49.589
Caroline, we'll be ready.

09:49.623 --> 09:50.791
Don't you worry.
Thank you.

09:55.696 --> 09:58.398
Okay, she is looking for
any reason to take us down.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.300
We have to get moving.
Where is Dave?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.601
We can't go anywhere
without a pilot.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.336
-Not a clue.
-I should fly Delta.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.974
-Five, winner!

10:07.007 --> 10:08.809
Unbelievable.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.177
That's, like, ten winners
in a row.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.279
I know. I kind of can't lose
right now.

10:12.312 --> 10:14.848
A roll like this
is incredibly rare.

10:14.882 --> 10:18.251
It's like a unicorn
fighting another unicorn.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.453
They're usually very friendly.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.622
Oh, uh, just checking,
this drink is free, too, right?

10:22.656 --> 10:24.758
Yes. You don't need
to ask me that every time.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.828
Gosh, this must be how
LL Cool J feels every day.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.196
Probably not.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.299
-I'll take it.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.002
You just keep on rolling.

10:35.035 --> 10:38.706
-Hey, Captain Dave's telephone.
Artem speaking.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.441
Artem, where did you take Dave,
and what is all that cheering?

10:41.474 --> 10:42.876
Oh, we're at the casino

10:42.910 --> 10:44.644
and he's playing craps.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.346
Captain Dave is on fire,

10:46.379 --> 10:49.149
just like left-handed children
in my village.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.517
What?! No.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.319
Our plane is ready.
We have to take off.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.154
You need to get him back
to the airport right now.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.824
All right.
Hey, it's Ronnie.

10:56.857 --> 10:59.192
She says she needs you back
at the airport right now.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.828
I just hit another winner.
I can't leave.

11:00.861 --> 11:02.830
-Tell her I ain't going, baby.
-Okay.

11:02.863 --> 11:05.966
-He says he's not coming.
-I said, "Ain't going, baby."

11:05.999 --> 11:08.135
ARTEM:
He said he's not going, baby.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.971
-Ain't going, baby!
-He says...

11:11.004 --> 11:12.005
I heard what he said.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.908
But did you hear how he said it?

11:23.683 --> 11:25.853
Dave's not coming back because
he's on a run at a craps table?

11:25.886 --> 11:27.654
This is ridiculous.
He's been gone for...

11:27.687 --> 11:29.556
five Oscar acceptance speeches.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.558
One: I still can't believe
that's how you keep time,

11:31.591 --> 11:34.494
and two: I am going to find Dave
and drag him back here,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.363
-whatever it takes.
-Maybe I should go with you.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.564
It was my mom he was dating.

11:37.597 --> 11:38.932
Maybe I can talk some sense
into him.

11:38.966 --> 11:40.734
I already told you
the plane is ready.

11:40.768 --> 11:42.035
Why are you standing around

11:42.069 --> 11:44.772
like a bunch of thick-ankled
moms at Disneyland?

11:44.805 --> 11:47.607
Oh, my God, Caroline,
that joke was eczema-mazing.

11:47.640 --> 11:50.177
Your wit, like your scalp,
is bone-dry.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.045
I'm so sorry, Caroline.
It's just gonna be

11:52.079 --> 11:54.414
another 15 minutes, I promise.

11:54.447 --> 11:56.249
It's a personal matter.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.118
I'm just having a lot of...

11:58.151 --> 12:00.220
...and it's just doing,
like, a whole...

12:00.253 --> 12:02.389
...thing.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.958
Fine, but if you're not back
in 15 minutes,

12:04.992 --> 12:07.460
I'll have no choice
but to report you.

12:08.595 --> 12:09.897
What the hell
with all the noises?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.731
I don't know, but whatever.
She's gone.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.066
For 15 minutes.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.534
That's not enough time
to get to the Strip and back.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.635
That's why we're
tag-teaming this.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.037
You stay here
and stall Caroline.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.105
Nichole and I will go get Dave.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.741
Can you run in those?

12:21.775 --> 12:23.944
Are you serious?
These are my gym heels.

12:28.849 --> 12:30.750
Is there another way to go?

12:30.784 --> 12:32.119
We're kind of in a hurry here.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.254
Ooh, that's another con
for the list: traffic.

12:34.287 --> 12:35.889
Vegas has tons of traffic.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.891
Traffic?
We live in Los Angeles.

12:37.925 --> 12:40.260
Yes, but our traffic
has famous people.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.095
At any given time, you could
get into a fender bender

12:42.129 --> 12:43.263
with Steve Harvey.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.597
Okay, Ronnie, what is
going on with you?

12:44.631 --> 12:47.267
Why are you so scared
to move in with Bryan?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.902
Because things seem
to be going great.

12:48.936 --> 12:51.171
Yeah, we're great now,
but what about in six months?

12:51.204 --> 12:52.739
Hell, six days?

12:52.772 --> 12:54.507
You're worrying about things
that haven't happened yet.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.509
And if there is a problem,
you guys will figure it out.

12:56.543 --> 12:59.146
I won't. My family sucks
at relationships.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.780
Growing up, I never saw
a normal one.

13:00.814 --> 13:02.515
It was always a disaster.

13:02.549 --> 13:05.352
They all ended in divorce,
jail, arson,

13:05.385 --> 13:07.520
and even worse, kids.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.122
Well, it doesn't have
to be that way with you.

13:09.156 --> 13:12.025
I don't want to risk it.

13:12.059 --> 13:14.361
Guess you have
your answer, then.

13:14.394 --> 13:15.628
-Yup.

13:15.662 --> 13:16.964
I don't mean to eavesdrop,

13:16.997 --> 13:18.498
but if you're single now,

13:18.531 --> 13:20.767
I've got a great guy
you should meet.

13:20.800 --> 13:24.137
His name is Jesus Christ.

13:24.171 --> 13:28.175
Oh, my God,
this place is packed.

13:28.208 --> 13:29.977
How are we gonna find him?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.945
CROWD :
Captain Dave! Captain Dave!

13:31.979 --> 13:33.847
Captain Dave!
Captain Dave!

13:33.881 --> 13:35.615
-I think he's that way.
-Mm-hmm.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.051
Captain Dave! Captain Dave!

13:38.085 --> 13:40.553
-Captain Dave!
-Hey.

13:40.587 --> 13:42.122
Guys, what are you
still doing here?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.124
We have to get Dave
back to the airport.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.659
First rule of gambling:
never interrupt a man

13:46.693 --> 13:48.661
during an epic roll of craps.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.397
-Yes, just don't do it.
-Shh. No.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.365
Are you... are you drunk, Colin?

13:52.399 --> 13:54.501
Shh. This isn't about me.

13:54.534 --> 13:56.703
It's about Dave... and me.

13:56.736 --> 13:59.006
It's about me and Dave and...
just, the point is,

13:59.039 --> 14:01.174
every time I put my hand on the
table and take a drink, he wins.

14:01.208 --> 14:02.175
So just watch.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.510
DAVE:
What time is it?

14:03.543 --> 14:05.913
CROWD:
Captain Dave time!

14:05.946 --> 14:08.148
What time is it?!

14:08.181 --> 14:09.582
Captain Dave time!

14:12.719 --> 14:15.555
Hey, ladies!
Aw, you made it.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.657
Dave, I am so glad
you're having fun,

14:17.690 --> 14:19.092
but you've got
to go fly the plane.

14:19.126 --> 14:20.693
Fun?
No, it's way more than that.

14:20.727 --> 14:22.562
This is the most alive I've felt

14:22.595 --> 14:23.931
since Patty and I broke up.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.432
Look, Dave, I know you're
winning a lot of money,

14:25.465 --> 14:26.900
-but...
-No, it's not about the money.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.936
It's about this moment.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.438
Something magical's happening,
and I can't walk away from it.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.340
I got to stay here
and see this through.

14:33.373 --> 14:36.009
I need this.

14:36.043 --> 14:37.644
Please?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.651
$20 on the hard ten.

14:46.987 --> 14:48.221
CROUPIER:
Hard ten!

14:48.255 --> 14:50.958
Winner!

14:52.792 --> 14:54.561
*

14:54.594 --> 14:58.131
* The birds are singing
their song *

14:58.165 --> 15:01.935
-* Just for me *

15:01.969 --> 15:04.804
* Together, their melody *

15:04.837 --> 15:07.975
* Is like a symphony
from above *

15:08.008 --> 15:11.911
* Well, it's the
wonderful life *

15:13.246 --> 15:15.682
* It's the wonderful life *

15:16.950 --> 15:18.885
* It's the wonderful life *

15:18.918 --> 15:22.990
* I'm dreaming of! *

15:27.194 --> 15:28.161
Bernard!

15:28.195 --> 15:29.496
Shirley Temple Black.

15:29.529 --> 15:31.264
Bernard, did you take a window

15:31.298 --> 15:33.000
to try and stall the plane?

15:33.033 --> 15:35.168
No. I was trying to take
a seat belt to stall the plane,

15:35.202 --> 15:36.736
and the window just fell out.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.306
This is a terrible airline.
How are we not dead?

15:39.339 --> 15:41.674
Save it, Bernard.
You don't have a pilot,

15:41.708 --> 15:43.176
you don't have a full crew,

15:43.210 --> 15:46.346
you don't have any more time.
I'm calling this in.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.281
Caroline, wait.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.482
I'm truly sorry
about what happened

15:49.516 --> 15:51.351
-with your boyfriend Steven.
-Mark.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.653
We didn't do a lot of talking.
The point is,

15:53.686 --> 15:55.922
I was wrong
to take him from you.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.291
I should have respected
what you two had.

15:58.325 --> 15:59.626
So why don't we stop fighting?

15:59.659 --> 16:01.428
If two boss bitches like us
teamed up,

16:01.461 --> 16:03.363
we'd be unstoppable.

16:03.396 --> 16:04.897
Come through, Caroline.

16:06.799 --> 16:09.002
Burn in hell, you hairless cat.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.876
-I don't know.

16:16.909 --> 16:18.378
I haven't thought this through.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.479
Alan, get over here.

16:19.512 --> 16:20.847
-Hey, Bernard.
-Shut up.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.316
Now, stand here and make sure

16:23.350 --> 16:25.718
Caroline doesn't come out
of the jetway, no matter what.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.423
I'm helping.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.362
Hey, what did I tell you?

16:35.395 --> 16:37.664
You had a bit of Vegas
in you all along.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.566
Not only do I have
some Vegas in me, old friend,

16:39.599 --> 16:41.501
I've become Vegas.

16:41.534 --> 16:44.237
My body is equal parts smoke,
liquor, strip-club fliers,

16:44.271 --> 16:46.339
and Guy Fieri donkey sauce.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.640
-Mwah.
-BERNARD: Let me through.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.077
Let me through.
Let me through. Let me through.

16:50.110 --> 16:51.811
Bernard, what are you
doing here?

16:51.844 --> 16:52.845
What happened to Caroline?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.381
-I locked her in the jetway.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.882
Don't act so surprised,
Bakersfield.

16:55.915 --> 16:57.750
At some point, every person
in your family's been locked up.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.386
What the hell are you
still doing here?

16:59.419 --> 17:01.688
I'm sorry, Bernard,
I got caught up in Dave's roll.

17:01.721 --> 17:03.990
It is the most incredible thing
I've ever seen.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.525
Bernard, you made it.
Get in here

17:05.558 --> 17:07.994
-and let me feel the burn.
-Not now, Dave.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.430
You're supposed to be flying
back to Los Angeles right now.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.533
You're right, I'm supposed
to be flying a plane,

17:13.566 --> 17:14.834
because I'm...

17:14.867 --> 17:18.371
ALL:
Captain Dave! Captain Dave!

17:18.405 --> 17:19.706
Ronnie, stop it!

17:19.739 --> 17:21.408
You're the wrangler.
Why aren't you wrangling?

17:21.441 --> 17:23.776
Bernard, this is no longer
just about us.

17:23.810 --> 17:27.080
Earlier today, this man told
an entire plane of people

17:27.114 --> 17:30.183
that he didn't need love,
and now look at this!

17:30.217 --> 17:32.051
He did this, and these people...

17:32.085 --> 17:33.052
they love him.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.088
Dave, they love you.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.456
You hear that, Bernard?

17:36.489 --> 17:38.391
ALL:
Captain Dave! Captain Dave!

17:38.425 --> 17:40.193
-They love me.
-Captain Dave!

17:40.227 --> 17:41.928
Captain Dave...

17:41.961 --> 17:43.963
*

17:46.433 --> 17:48.435
I think I'm done.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.538
Sorry, guys.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.307
I've gotten everything
I need here.

18:02.149 --> 18:03.783
Okay, Bernard, let's do this.

18:03.816 --> 18:06.052
We've got to free Caroline,
beg for forgiveness,

18:06.085 --> 18:08.421
-and get all these angry people
on the plane.
-Got it.

18:08.455 --> 18:11.824
-Bernard, didn't you say
you locked her in the jetway?

18:11.858 --> 18:12.825
It got out.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.764
And it's taunting us.

18:21.468 --> 18:22.802
-Oh.
-Oh, hey, guys.

18:22.835 --> 18:23.936
Guess what we just did.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.405
-That's okay.
-I will not.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.807
Um... uh... so,
we-we got our pilot back,

18:27.840 --> 18:31.144
and if it's okay with you,

18:31.178 --> 18:33.112
we-we're ready to go now,
Caroline.

18:33.146 --> 18:35.148
I'm gonna need 15 more minutes.

18:35.182 --> 18:36.816
It's finally my turn.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.357
Well, we're in the clear,
but it'll be a little while

18:44.391 --> 18:45.925
before the plane is ready to go.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.428
They're doing a floor-to-ceiling
wipe-down of the front galley.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.096
So, I guess it wasn't practical
to burn the whole plane, then?

18:50.129 --> 18:51.130
Mm.

18:51.164 --> 18:53.132
We are so lucky.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.134
Today could have gone wrong
a thousand different ways.

18:55.168 --> 18:56.369
But it didn't.

18:56.403 --> 18:58.505
And when fate pulls up
and offers you a joyride,

18:58.538 --> 18:59.539
you can't walk away.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.641
Yeah, but it was such
a huge risk.

19:01.674 --> 19:02.975
Of course it was a risk, Ronnie,

19:03.009 --> 19:04.277
but if you don't take any risks,

19:04.311 --> 19:06.179
you'll miss out
on so many good things in life.

19:06.213 --> 19:07.514
And the more things you try,

19:07.547 --> 19:09.716
the easier it is to figure out
what you really want.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.355
Let me know when
Bernard snaps out of it.

19:16.856 --> 19:19.492
I saw every muscle
in Caroline's back.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.639
Bryan. Hi.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.074
What are you doing here?
I was just about to call you.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.743
Well, I hadn't heard
from you today,

19:36.776 --> 19:38.678
and I saw your flight
was delayed,

19:38.711 --> 19:40.012
so, in order
to get through security,

19:40.046 --> 19:41.681
I bought the cheapest ticket
I could find.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.683
Let me guess, Bakersfield?

19:43.716 --> 19:47.354
Bingo. But it was worth
the $18 just to see you.

19:47.387 --> 19:49.756
I was a little worried
that you might be freaking out

19:49.789 --> 19:52.525
-about this whole
moving-in situation.
-Bingo.

19:52.559 --> 19:55.228
Look, I know that it's
a big step in a relationship,

19:55.262 --> 19:57.830
so, if we're moving too fast,

19:57.864 --> 19:59.666
we can take it a little slower.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.235
So, here's a key to my place,

20:02.269 --> 20:04.003
and you can come and go
as you please.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.204
I'm not gonna need this.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.073
Oh. Well, that's harsh.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.509
No, no, I'm not gonna need it

20:09.542 --> 20:11.711
because I want to
move in with you.

20:11.744 --> 20:15.582
Look, I am so terrified
that I'm gonna screw this up.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.717
But you are caring
and thoughtful,

20:17.750 --> 20:18.885
and you love all my faults.

20:18.918 --> 20:20.052
I like to think
of them as quirks.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.489
And that's why you're
worth the risk.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.895
Oh, wait, I guess
I will need that key.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.463
Actually, I'll need
multiple copies

20:30.497 --> 20:31.898
because I will
most likely lose it.

20:31.931 --> 20:33.900
Great. We'll make copies
of the key I just gave you.

20:33.933 --> 20:35.468
-I already lost it.
-Great.

20:35.502 --> 20:38.070
-Then I'll change
the locks to my house.

20:39.105 --> 20:42.642
Colin, you have
the beautiful afterglow

20:42.675 --> 20:44.277
of a man who has just
consummated

20:44.311 --> 20:47.547
his relationship
with Lady Vegas.

20:47.580 --> 20:49.749
Well, she certainly had
her way with me.

20:49.782 --> 20:52.218
Oh, there's half a cigarette
in my hair.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.253
At least you know
you did Vegas right.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.658
Artem, thanks for taking me
to the casino.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.893
You really helped me
get my swagger back.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.094
It's my pleasure, Captain Dave.

21:02.128 --> 21:03.896
What are you gonna do
with all your money?

21:03.930 --> 21:06.333
Hey, you should buy
a PT Cruiser.

21:06.366 --> 21:09.802
Imagine owning a car
that people can only rent.

21:09.836 --> 21:11.471
I already know
what I'm gonna do.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.473
I'm buying an engagement ring
for Patricia.

21:13.506 --> 21:14.507
COLIN:
What?

21:14.541 --> 21:15.508
I thought today was all about

21:15.542 --> 21:16.576
getting over Patricia.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.411
Oh, it was,
but as I was standing

21:18.445 --> 21:20.347
at the craps table, in the
middle of all those people

21:20.380 --> 21:22.114
chanting my name, it hit me.

21:22.148 --> 21:23.416
I know I said I don't need love,

21:23.450 --> 21:26.986
but the truth is,
I need love constantly.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.020
All the time.

21:28.054 --> 21:29.322
And proposing to Patricia

21:29.356 --> 21:30.790
will get you that?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.125
Well, I'm pretty sure
not proposing won't.

21:33.159 --> 21:35.628
Dave, I know we're all
on a bit of a high from today,

21:35.662 --> 21:37.296
but this is
a really big decision.

21:37.330 --> 21:38.297
Will you keep it down?

21:38.331 --> 21:39.532
I'm on the horn
with my ring guy.

21:39.566 --> 21:42.101
Hey, Harry.
It's Dave Pratman.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.603
I met another "the one."

21:43.636 --> 21:46.305
So, give me the usual.
Thanks, buddy.

21:46.339 --> 21:48.541
And mazel tov right back at you.

21:51.578 --> 21:53.546
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

21:56.148 --> 21:58.217
You've hit the jackpot
with LA to Vegas.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.653
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

22:02.021 --> 22:03.990
911. What's your emergency?

22:04.023 --> 22:06.626
MAN :
I'm on Flight 46,
and we're going down.

22:06.659 --> 22:09.396
Just tell my wife
I'm so sorry that I cannot
come home to you.

22:09.429 --> 22:10.497
Hello?

22:12.599 --> 22:15.568
This is your family.
We got you, okay?

22:17.236 --> 22:18.371
Rapid response now!

22:18.405 --> 22:21.340
-We can't save everyone.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.576
It's time we showed Gotham
who we are.
