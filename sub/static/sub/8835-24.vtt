01:48.401 --> 01:49.611
I HAVEN'T PACKED

HANSON,

02:17.263 --> 02:18.139
NOT TO MENTION
ANY HUCKSTER

02:18.306 --> 02:19.933
THAT FEELS LIKE
SETTING UP SHOP.

02:20.099 --> 02:21.935
FOR WALNUT GROVE,
AND THAT MEANS

02:22.101 --> 02:24.103
A LITTLE PROSPERITY
FOR EVERYBODY.

02:24.270 --> 02:26.022
AND IT'S MORE
THAN THAT.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.024
IT'S--IT'S A COMMUNITY EFFORT.

02:28.191 --> 02:29.317
IT'S SOMETHING
WE CAN

02:29.484 --> 02:31.027
ALL PARTICIPATE IN
AND ENJOY.

02:31.194 --> 02:32.654
THAT'S THE WOMEN'S LEAGUE
TALKING.

A GREAT DEAL OF THOUGHT,

02:45.542 --> 02:47.418

02:48.711 --> 02:50.296

BE ANY FUN.

02:50.463 --> 02:52.048
WELL, I CAN'T LEARN
TO SKIP ROPE,

02:52.215 --> 02:54.300
AND I CAN'T ROLL A HOOP
WORTH A HOOT.

02:54.467 --> 02:55.927

03:13.695 --> 03:14.571
OH, JUST CALL ME JIM.

03:14.737 --> 03:15.822
NO NEED
FOR THAT "MISTER."

03:15.989 --> 03:17.282

GUESS THERE'S NOT MUCH ABOUT
LOGGING I DON'T KNOW.

03:47.729 --> 03:51.316
YOU KEEP AN EYE ON ME, BOY,
YOU'LL LEARN A THING OR TWO.

03:51.482 --> 03:53.359
I DON'T GUESS THERE'S
A FARMER IN A THOUSAND

03:53.526 --> 03:56.029
KNOWS HOW TO USE
A CROSSCUT SAW.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.614
SEE, YOU NEVER
PUSH ON IT.

03:57.780 --> 04:01.451
GOT TO PULL IT. CAN'T LEAN
ON HER TO BEND IT, TWIST IT.

04:04.495 --> 04:06.039
AH, LOOK HERE, SON.

04:06.205 --> 04:07.832
I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

04:07.999 --> 04:11.044

SET ON THESE CUTTING TEETH,

04:11.210 --> 04:12.587
YOUR SAW'LL CHOKE
ON YOU.

04:12.754 --> 04:14.380
TOO LITTLE SET,
AND SHE BINDS.

04:17.842 --> 04:20.345
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:20.511 --> 04:22.388
WHY'D YOU ASK THAT?

04:22.555 --> 04:23.681
WELL, YOU AIN'T HARDLY
SAID ANYTHING

04:23.848 --> 04:26.142
SINCE WE STARTED OUT.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.728
I'M JUST QUIET,
I GUESS.

I KNOW TO WORK.

04:38.404 --> 04:40.907

ALL DAY TO PROVE IT.

05:56.441 --> 05:57.984
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

05:58.151 --> 05:59.485
HOW DID THE WORK GO?

05:59.652 --> 06:00.611
IT WENT FINE.

06:00.778 --> 06:02.405
WE GOT ENOUGH CUT
FOR 4 OR 5 LOADS.

06:02.572 --> 06:03.823
WE'LL HAUL THEM
IN TOMORROW.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.908
WELL, I'D CALL IT
A FAIR DAY'S WORK.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.869
COULD HAVE GOT
A LOT MORE DONE

06:08.036 --> 06:09.954
IF I'D OF HAD SOMEBODY
BESIDES A FARMER

06:10.121 --> 06:11.956
ON THE OTHER END
OF THAT SAW.

06:12.123 --> 06:13.958
YOUR FRIEND TALKS A LOT
BETTER THAN HE CUTS.

06:14.125 --> 06:16.210
WELL, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT
YOU'RE A FARMER.

06:16.377 --> 06:17.670
I'M PROUD TO BE
A FARMER.

06:17.837 --> 06:19.130
AS FOR RUNNING
A CROSS-CUT,

06:19.297 --> 06:22.759
I'M AS GOOD AS YOU EVER
WERE, PROBABLY BETTER.

06:22.925 --> 06:25.094
THAT'S PRETTY STRONG TALK
COMING FROM A FARMER, BOY.

06:25.261 --> 06:26.971
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

06:27.138 --> 06:30.349
WELL, NOW, WITH
TWO MEN ON ONE SAW,

06:30.516 --> 06:33.728
IT--IT ISN'T EASY
TO TELL WHO IS BEST.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.189
HOW IS IT THAT
THE LOGGERS PROVE

06:36.355 --> 06:38.441
WHO IS CHAMPION LOGGER?

06:38.608 --> 06:40.860
WITH AN AX, CHOPPING.
YOU KNOW THAT.

06:41.027 --> 06:42.695
EXACTLY.

06:42.862 --> 06:46.032
AND THAT'S WHY HANSON'S MILL IS
DONATING A WATCH AND A BLUE RIBBON

06:46.199 --> 06:48.201
TO THE WINNER
OF THE CHOPPING CONTEST

06:48.367 --> 06:49.535

TO GET HOME

07:17.271 --> 07:18.689
AND PLAY
WITH MY YOUNG'UNS.

07:18.856 --> 07:20.108
AS BULL OF THE WOODS,

07:20.274 --> 07:22.110
I HAD TO LEARN HOW
TO TELL THE TRUTH

07:22.276 --> 07:23.611
ABOUT THE MEN
I WORKED WITH.

07:23.778 --> 07:25.613
THAT'S THE REASON
I HAD TO SAY

07:25.780 --> 07:27.240
THAT YOU'RE SURE
NO LOGGER.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.117
THAT'S RIGHT, IT'S THE TRUTH.
I'M A FARMER.

AND MARE,

07:30.785 --> 07:31.744
I EXPECT YOU'RE
PRETTY GOOD.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.663
THOSE ARE THE TOOLS
OF A FARMER.

07:33.830 --> 07:35.123
BUT A CROSS-CUT,
YOU SEE,

07:35.289 --> 07:36.415
THAT'S A TOOL
OF A LOGGER.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.417
YOU'VE SURE GOT A LOT
TO LEARN ABOUT THAT.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.212
WE'LL SEE WHAT I HAVE
TO LEARN ABOUT AN AX.

07:41.379 --> 07:42.338
WHAT'D YOU SAY?

07:42.505 --> 07:44.090

08:44.108 --> 08:46.694
YOU KNOW, HE WAS WORKING
WITH A NEW MAN TODAY.

08:46.861 --> 08:49.322
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T WANT
TO PUSH HIM TOO HARD.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.991
IS PA THE STRONGEST MAN
IN THE WORLD?

08:52.158 --> 08:54.744
[GIGGLING] NO, DEAR.
BUT HE IS STRONG.

08:54.911 --> 08:55.661

WHAT HE SAID?

28:10.648 --> 28:12.400
SHE BUMPED MY HOOP.

28:12.567 --> 28:14.527
WELL, I'M SURE IT WAS
JUST AN ACCIDENT.

28:14.694 --> 28:15.945
NO, IT WASN'T.

28:16.112 --> 28:18.323
ALL THE SAME, WINNING'S
NOT THE IMPORTANT THING.

HOW'S THE ANKLE?

32:39.876 --> 32:41.085
SHE CAN'T RUN.

32:41.252 --> 32:44.213

33:03.274 --> 33:05.943
IT'S A SHAME. IT CAN'T

LET'S GET THIS SHOE ON.
I DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS.

33:39.519 --> 33:42.814

33:47.694 --> 33:49.612
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHY NOT.

33:49.779 --> 33:53.199
BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR.
MRS. INGALLS IS A GROWN-UP.

33:53.366 --> 33:54.784
IF SHE CAN RACE,
YOU CAN.

33:54.951 --> 33:56.911

34:01.833 --> 34:04.627
WELL, NO, BUT I DON'T
THINK IT'S PROPER.

39:54.852 --> 39:56.228
YOU SURE HAVE, PA.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.856
HE'S TIRED. YOU SEE HIM
BREATHING AFTER THAT GO-ROUND?

39:59.023 --> 39:59.940
HE LOOKED LIKE
A WIND-BROKE HORSE.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.317
I NOTICED THAT.

40:01.484 --> 40:03.319
NO KINDA REST IS GONNA
HELP THAT TIRED.

40:03.486 --> 40:05.237
YOU'RE GONNA WIN THE
RIBBON AND THE WATCH.

40:05.404 --> 40:06.822

WE'LL HELP YOU
LOOK FOR IT, PA.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.578
THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I KNOW WHERE
I CAN FIND ANOTHER ONE.

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

40:29.678 --> 40:31.597
MR. INGALLS.

40:31.764 --> 40:33.516

40:33.682 --> 40:36.018

MR. INGALLS,
MY HUSBAND'S TIRED.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.906
THAT MAKES
TWO OF US.

40:49.073 --> 40:50.783
OH. NO, I MEAN
REALLY TIRED.

40:50.950 --> 40:52.284
HE WOULDN'T ADMIT IT,

40:52.451 --> 40:54.245
NOT EVEN TO ME, BUT...

40:54.411 --> 40:56.163
WELL, THAT NEVER HAPPENED
ALL THE YEARS

40:56.330 --> 40:58.457
HE WAS BULL OF THE WOODS.

40:59.416 --> 41:02.044
OOH, YOU SHOULD HAVE
KNOWN HIM THEN.

41:02.211 --> 41:06.882
HE COULD OUT-SAW,
OUT-CHOP, OUT-WORK ANY MAN,

41:07.049 --> 41:08.259
ANY TWO MEN.

41:08.425 --> 41:10.719
NEVER AN ACHE OR PAIN.

41:14.807 --> 41:16.851
BUT THAT'S NOT
TRUE ANYMORE.

41:19.895 --> 41:21.397
AND HE KNOWS IT.

41:26.193 --> 41:29.238
EVERY DAY, HE FEELS LIKE
HE HAS TO PROVE HIMSELF.

41:31.615 --> 41:34.869
AND EVERY DAY, IT GETS
JUST A LITTLE BIT HARDER.

41:37.746 --> 41:39.790
A BLUE RIBBON
AND A WATCH.

41:41.333 --> 41:44.086
NOT TO PUSH
UNDER SOMEBODY'S NOSE,

41:44.253 --> 41:48.465
BUT TO--TO HAVE...

41:48.632 --> 41:49.758
TO TOUCH.

41:52.344 --> 41:53.679
TO GIVE HIM BACK SOMETHING

41:53.846 --> 41:56.599
THAT THE YEARS
HAVE TAKEN AWAY FROM HIM.

41:57.975 --> 41:59.602
THAT'S WHAT HE WANTS.

42:01.312 --> 42:03.022
A WATCH.

42:04.940 --> 42:06.317
A WATCH THAT TELLS HIM

42:06.483 --> 42:09.695
HE IS STILL
BULL OF THE WOODS!

45:18.717 --> 45:20.469
THERE IS YOUR WATCH.

45:27.851 --> 45:30.521
HEY, HALF-PINT,
DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

45:30.687 --> 45:32.356
IT WAS FUN.

45:32.523 --> 45:34.274
I DID MY BEST.

45:34.441 --> 45:37.069
IT'S TIME
TO GO HOME.

45:37.236 --> 45:39.029
I'LL GET THE WAGON
HITCHED UP.

45:39.196 --> 45:41.949
WE'LL PACK UP
THE PICNIC THINGS.

45:52.543 --> 45:54.211
THEY DON'T WORK
TOO WELL.

45:54.378 --> 45:55.421
HEY!

46:11.728 --> 46:12.771
PA?

46:15.065 --> 46:17.943
YOU USED A BORROWED AX
TILL THE END.

46:18.110 --> 46:20.904
THEN YOU USED
YOUR OLD ONE.

46:22.281 --> 46:23.782
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

46:23.949 --> 46:25.033
WHY, PA?

46:27.619 --> 46:28.745
WELL, I'LL TELL
YOU HALF-PINT,

46:28.912 --> 46:31.498
MR. TYLER'S A GOOD
MAN WITH AN AX.

46:32.416 --> 46:34.293
BUT HE'S A LOT
OLDER THAN I AM.

46:34.460 --> 46:36.503
YOU KNOW,
WHEN YOU GET OLDER,

46:36.670 --> 46:38.881
YOU--YOU GET TIRED
A LOT EASIER.

46:39.047 --> 46:40.924
JUST LIKE
YOU WINNING A RACE

46:41.091 --> 46:42.259
WITH A BIG
HEAD START.

46:42.426 --> 46:44.219
IT DOESN'T MEAN
ANYTHING TO WIN

46:44.386 --> 46:45.762
IF YOU HAVE
A HEAD START.

46:45.929 --> 46:46.930
SURE DOESN'T.

46:47.097 --> 46:49.725
THAT'S WHY
I SWITCHED THE AXES.

46:49.892 --> 46:51.226
JUST SO
IT WOULD BE EVEN

46:51.393 --> 46:53.061
'TWEEN ME
AND MR. TYLER.

46:54.396 --> 46:55.772
CAN YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT?

46:57.691 --> 46:59.193
I SUPPOSE.

47:00.944 --> 47:03.363
MR. TYLER SURE IS
HAPPY ABOUT WINNING.

47:06.867 --> 47:09.369
NO HAPPIER THAN I AM
ABOUT LOSING.
