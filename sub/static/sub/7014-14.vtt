00:04.700 --> 00:05.734
It's been like an hour,

00:05.830 --> 00:07.731
and my dad is still upstairs
talking to your folks.

00:07.862 --> 00:10.082
Our pregnancy scare must have
really freaked 'em out.

00:10.178 --> 00:11.498
Yeah, well,
that's because "pregnancy"

00:11.585 --> 00:13.354
is one of the scariest words
in the english language...

00:14.803 --> 00:17.474
right after "monster"
and "broccoli."

00:18.712 --> 00:19.878
Well, I'm not pregnant.

00:20.486 --> 00:21.286
Everything's fine,

00:21.408 --> 00:24.262
so I'm sure our parents
will calm down soon.

00:26.004 --> 00:27.823
Hey, fornicators, upstairs!

00:31.108 --> 00:32.978
Oh, god, we're dead.
You know what?

00:33.087 --> 00:34.426
None of this would have
happened

00:34.567 --> 00:36.160
if you hadn't insisted
on sleeping with me.

00:37.123 --> 00:38.190
I insisted?

00:38.447 --> 00:40.262
You wouldn't give me
my wallet back.

00:41.724 --> 00:42.662
Look,
we're in this together.

00:43.152 --> 00:43.926
You were there, too.

00:46.345 --> 00:47.744
Or was I?

00:49.429 --> 00:51.679
The jedi mind trick
doesn't work in real life, dink.

00:54.187 --> 00:55.332
Or does it?

00:57.500 --> 00:59.400
Oh, hey,

00:59.800 --> 01:02.700
what's shakin', gang?

01:02.700 --> 01:07.300
Certainly not Donna's belly
from being pregnant, right?

01:07.300 --> 01:10.400
You're not funny.
You're a sinner.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.300
Now sit.

01:15.800 --> 01:18.700
We have decided that you two
need premarital counseling

01:18.700 --> 01:20.800
at church.

01:21.500 --> 01:22.900
Premarital?

01:22.900 --> 01:25.500
Counseling? Church?

01:25.500 --> 01:30.300
Why am I talking
like a speak & spell?

01:30.300 --> 01:32.100
Dad, you think
this is a good idea?

01:32.100 --> 01:36.600
No. I suggested we get him
fixed like a dog.

01:36.600 --> 01:39.300
Counseling can be
extremely beneficial.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.400
I knew two boys who were about
to marry their sweethearts.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.600
One boy went to counseling,
and one didn't.

01:44.600 --> 01:49.400
And the one who didn't go
to counseling died.

01:49.400 --> 01:51.600
I'll tell ya,
if midge and I had counseling,

01:51.600 --> 01:53.600
it might have
saved our marriage.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.900
Of course, not sleeping
with degenerates

01:55.900 --> 01:59.300
from the pool hall
would have helped, too.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.200
So you want us
to go to counseling?

02:01.200 --> 02:04.300
Mom, where do you even
come up with this stuff?

02:04.300 --> 02:05.600
It wasn't my idea.

02:05.600 --> 02:10.400
Steven was thoughtful enough
to suggest it.

02:10.400 --> 02:13.000
You're welcome.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.900
Okay, you guys,
this church counseling idea

02:52.900 --> 02:54.300
is really crappy.

02:54.300 --> 02:57.200
Would you listen
to the language on this kid?

02:57.200 --> 03:01.100
What he needs is church
and lots of it.

03:01.500 --> 03:04.700
You know, Eric, you may not
think that you need counseling,

03:04.700 --> 03:07.200
but maybe Donna does.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.700
No, she doesn't.

03:10.300 --> 03:12.000
Well, actually,

03:12.000 --> 03:13.800
I think counseling might
help us work through some

03:13.800 --> 03:15.700
of our issues
before we get married.

03:15.700 --> 03:17.600
- We don't have issues.
- Yes, we do.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.000
- No, we don't.
- Do. - Don't.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.900
Okay, see?
You don't do the do/don't

03:20.900 --> 03:24.700
if you don't have issues,
which you do.

03:24.700 --> 03:27.000
Okay, dad, how can you think
this is a good idea?

03:27.000 --> 03:30.000
You always say to take care
of family business at home.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.100
I am taking care
of business at home.

03:32.100 --> 03:33.900
Because if you two
don't do this,

03:33.900 --> 03:35.300
do you know what
it's gonna be like

03:35.300 --> 03:38.500
living with your mother?

03:38.500 --> 03:42.200
Just more of a delight
every day, is what.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.700
Well, come on, Eric.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.700
We'll learn stuff
about each other.

03:46.700 --> 03:48.400
For instance,
what if one day

03:48.400 --> 03:51.300
I get a high-paying job
in california? Will you move?

03:51.300 --> 03:55.300
Whoa. Why can't i get
the high-paying job?

03:55.300 --> 03:57.400
Okay, what if you get
a high-paying job?

03:57.400 --> 03:58.900
Will I move?

03:58.900 --> 04:04.700
Who am I kidding? I'm not
getting a high-paying job.

04:05.700 --> 04:08.700
All right, civilians.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.400
Hide your stashes.

04:10.400 --> 04:15.200
Officer-in-training kelso's back
from the academy.

04:15.200 --> 04:16.600
I gotta be honest, man.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.000
Every day you come home
with all your fingers,

04:19.000 --> 04:21.600
I die a little inside.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.500
Michael, you got
another "d" on a test?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.700
Is this your fourth "d"
in a row?

04:26.700 --> 04:28.300
Yeah.

04:28.300 --> 04:30.400
It's just
on the penal code stuff.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.400
Criminals have a right
to an attorney.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.200
Criminals are innocent
until proven guilty.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.900
Just crazy liberal gibberish.

04:40.200 --> 04:42.300
What are you laughing at?

04:42.300 --> 04:45.200
He said "penal code."

04:46.100 --> 04:48.500
Fez, it doesn't mean that.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.700
It's from the word "penalty."

04:50.700 --> 04:53.800
"Penal"

04:55.000 --> 04:59.200
You're like a 4 year old.
It's a legal term. "Penal."

05:01.100 --> 05:03.800
it's kind of funny.

05:04.800 --> 05:06.000
Hey, guys.

05:06.000 --> 05:07.200
Hey, michael.

05:07.200 --> 05:08.900
How'd
your penal code test go?

05:12.300 --> 05:14.200
I did great.
I got another "B."

05:14.200 --> 05:17.600
Oh, that's your fourth "B"
in a row.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.100
I'm so proud of you.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.700
Can I see it?
Uh...

05:22.000 --> 05:23.700
uh, you could,

05:23.700 --> 05:26.100
but I didn't write
anything down

05:26.100 --> 05:28.500
'cause the test was oral.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.100
Oral test
on the penal code.

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
so, um...

05:37.200 --> 05:39.000
are you free
this afternoon?

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
I thought maybe
we could do something.

05:41.000 --> 05:43.000
How about go-carting?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.700
Um...

05:44.700 --> 05:46.700
how about putting
together a crib?

05:46.700 --> 05:49.700
Does the crib have wheels?

05:49.700 --> 05:52.300
Yeah.
Then I'm in.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.900
Great.
I'll meet you outside.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.400
Bye, guys.
Bye.

05:59.300 --> 06:00.600
Hey, michael,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.500
how come you told
library barbie

06:02.500 --> 06:05.000
you got "bs"
instead of "ds"?

06:05.000 --> 06:07.400
Look, some people bring flowers.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.100
Some people buy chocolates.

06:09.100 --> 06:12.500
I lie about my intelligence.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.800
It's not working.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.300
She's locked up
the old funhouse,

06:17.300 --> 06:20.100
if you know what I mean.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.700
Michael, no way.
She's totally into you.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.600
She changed
from clear lip gloss

06:27.600 --> 06:30.100
to pink shimmer.

06:30.900 --> 06:32.600
What more
does she need to do,

06:32.600 --> 06:35.800
shout "I love you"
from the rooftops?

06:35.800 --> 06:38.200
She could give me
something besides a kiss on the cheek.

06:38.200 --> 06:39.300
It's like kissing your cousin.

06:41.200 --> 06:45.000
Oh, the cousin kiss...

06:45.600 --> 06:49.400
the sexiest
of all relative kisses.

06:49.400 --> 06:52.900
Right above
big-breasted aunt

06:52.900 --> 06:55.700
and sleepy grandma.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.400
Did you just say
"sleepy grandma"?

06:59.400 --> 07:01.500
You telling me
you kiss your grandma?

07:01.500 --> 07:04.600
Not my grandma.
A grandma.

07:04.600 --> 07:07.000
Sick bastard.

07:09.900 --> 07:13.000
I gotta say, I'm excited
about marriage counseling.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.400
I'm looking forward
to hearing from a third party

07:15.400 --> 07:17.800
that I'm right about everything.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.000
Oh, and I want my marriage
to Eric to be magical.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.200
I know how you could do that.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.700
Marry someone besides Eric.

07:26.700 --> 07:28.900
Hey, I'll see you guys later.

07:28.900 --> 07:32.700
I got someplace
I really need to be.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.100
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.

07:36.100 --> 07:38.700
Had someplace
I really needed to be.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.100
Okay, so get this.

07:40.100 --> 07:44.000
I don't want counseling.
Donna does. So we're going.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.100
I'll tell ya,
ever since we got engaged,

07:46.100 --> 07:50.100
she's been treating me
like some kind of child.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.500
Oh, where's my toy surprise?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.100
Oh, Kelso,
watch it with that gun, man.

07:56.100 --> 07:59.800
Oh, relax, Eric. It's not a gun.
It's a flare gun.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.100
Yeah, tomorrow's flare day
at the academy,

08:02.100 --> 08:03.700
so we're learning how
to use these.

08:03.700 --> 08:04.700
Besides, they're totally safe.

08:04.700 --> 08:07.100
All they do is shoot
balls of fire.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.700
Kelso, I don't think you should
be playing with fire

08:10.700 --> 08:13.100
when we're all...

08:13.200 --> 08:14.600
never mind.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.300
Man, I gotta stop hitting
two circles in one day.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.100
I could swear I just saw
a ball of fire

08:20.100 --> 08:22.900
shoot through this room.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.800
Zowie!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.300
Okay, so what
brings you to counseling?

08:30.300 --> 08:32.500
A firm tug
on the old ball and chain,

08:32.500 --> 08:35.299
if you know what I mean.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.600
What Eric
is trying to say is

08:37.600 --> 08:41.500
we wanted to talk to someone
about the pitfalls of marriage.

08:41.500 --> 08:44.400
And we have some
little issues.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.000
For example,

08:46.000 --> 08:48.300
Eric sometimes likes
to talk too much about

08:48.300 --> 08:50.600
Star Wars.

08:51.400 --> 08:52.800
I understand.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.600
You do?

08:54.900 --> 08:56.700
See, this is great.

08:56.700 --> 09:01.700
Yeah, Star Wars is
the greatest movie of all time.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.500
It's hard not to
talk about Star Wars.

09:04.500 --> 09:07.200
Wow! This is great!

09:08.900 --> 09:10.900
Oh, oh, no.

09:11.700 --> 09:13.800
I can't believe
you've seen Star Wars.

09:13.800 --> 09:16.100
Well, I like to stay current
with pop culture,

09:16.100 --> 09:19.300
so that I can connect
with the youth I counsel.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.500
Say how about that disco?

09:23.700 --> 09:27.300
Um, disco kinda blows.
I agree.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.400
Blow on, disco.

09:29.400 --> 09:31.300
Blow on.

09:33.000 --> 09:36.100
Can we get back
to me and Eric, please?

09:36.100 --> 09:38.500
Because sometimes
I feel like

09:38.500 --> 09:40.600
we're racing
toward this wedding,

09:40.600 --> 09:43.900
and we're not even enjoying it
as much as we could be.

09:43.900 --> 09:45.900
Hmm, I see.

09:46.400 --> 09:49.200
Like in Star Wars,

09:49.500 --> 09:52.500
when Luke,
much like the two of you,

09:52.500 --> 09:54.900
wasn't the pilot
of his own future.

09:54.900 --> 09:57.200
But he was a great pilot.
He used to bull's-eye

09:57.200 --> 10:01.000
wamp rats...
in his t-16 back home!

10:02.700 --> 10:05.800
I should be marrying you.

10:06.700 --> 10:08.900
I thought this was
a counseling session,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.400
not a dork-off.

10:11.400 --> 10:14.000
I'm sorry, Donna.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.300
Okay, look, instead of talking

10:17.300 --> 10:19.400
about what worries you
about marriage,

10:19.400 --> 10:22.100
let's talk about
what excites you about marriage.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.700
Oh.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.100
Okay, well...

10:32.200 --> 10:34.400
hmm. That's weird.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.100
I can't really think
of anything.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.900
You can't think of anything?

10:38.900 --> 10:42.400
Well, hang on.
Give me a second.

10:44.300 --> 10:46.700
Nope. Nothing.

10:46.700 --> 10:50.500
Well, one thing young newlyweds
usually get excited about,

10:50.500 --> 10:53.900
and that's having sexual
relations for the first time.

10:53.900 --> 10:58.700
I'm sure you're both
looking forward to that.

10:58.700 --> 11:00.700
Oh, um...

11:01.300 --> 11:06.400
unless of course,
you've already had sex.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.900
Premarital sex.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.100
What?
Huh?

11:12.200 --> 11:15.200
Pre-what-ital-who?

11:15.200 --> 11:16.800
I mean, come on,
look at me.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.700
Do I look like some guy
who's had sex?

11:18.700 --> 11:21.200
I mean... right?

11:23.300 --> 11:25.400
You're seeing pictures
of what's left

11:25.400 --> 11:27.800
of the point place
police academy auditorium,

11:27.800 --> 11:31.100
where a fire broke out today.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.700
I hope Kelso's okay.

11:32.700 --> 11:36.700
Yeah, I know he's there,
'cause today was flare day.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.900
Today was flare day!

11:44.800 --> 11:47.200
Hey, what's up?

11:56.500 --> 11:57.600
Okay, fine.

11:57.600 --> 12:00.100
I was at the academy
when the auditorium burned down,

12:00.100 --> 12:02.000
but it totally wasn't my fault.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.600
See, I got there early
to practice with my flare gun

12:04.600 --> 12:07.300
'cause I wanted to show brooke
an actual "b" for a change.

12:07.300 --> 12:11.300
Okay, so far
zero percent your fault.

12:11.300 --> 12:12.400
All right,

12:12.400 --> 12:14.300
so I accidentally
shot off a flare,

12:14.300 --> 12:16.400
and it went all...

12:16.400 --> 12:18.800
right underneath the bleachers.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.400
Well, we've just jumped up
to about 60% your fault.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.300
Okay, so then I shot off
another flare

12:24.300 --> 12:26.700
at the first flare
'cause you know what they say.

12:26.700 --> 12:30.300
You gotta fight fire with fire.

12:31.700 --> 12:36.200
Yeah, this is now,
like, 99% your fault.

12:36.200 --> 12:39.700
So then I shot off
another flare

12:39.700 --> 12:43.200
to warn people
about the fire.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.300
But that one just went
right up and on the roof,

12:46.300 --> 12:48.700
and that's when I just got
the hell out of there.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.900
$5?

13:01.700 --> 13:03.100
For pete's sakes,

13:03.100 --> 13:05.000
God doesn't drive
a cadillac.

13:07.100 --> 13:10.000
You know, in these times
of loose morals,

13:10.000 --> 13:13.800
even my faith gets challenged,
much like han solo's faith

13:13.800 --> 13:19.300
in his sometimes unreliable
"millennium falcon."

13:19.300 --> 13:22.000
Which is why I'm so pleased
to recently meet

13:22.000 --> 13:23.900
a young engaged couple

13:23.900 --> 13:27.600
who have turned their backs
on temptation,

13:27.600 --> 13:32.500
despite the lure
of premarital sex.

13:32.500 --> 13:35.400
Oh, no.
Oh, god. Oh, no.

13:35.600 --> 13:43.700
So here they are--
Eric Forman and Donna Pinciotti.

13:43.700 --> 13:46.100
Please stand.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.400
Oh, look,
it's Eric and Donna.

14:01.400 --> 14:06.000
Did everyone know
they're virgins?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.200
I think I wanna be
a virgin, too.

14:08.200 --> 14:10.400
Hey, everyone,
I'm a virgin!

14:12.500 --> 14:15.500
well, I said it,
so it must be true.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.800
Okay, I know this seems
really bad,

14:17.800 --> 14:20.900
but I got a really simple way
to fix this.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.300
Just start going
to a different church.

14:24.300 --> 14:26.500
Hey, how about that one
where they sing more

14:26.500 --> 14:30.400
and let you marry,
like, six people?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.600
Hey, Red,

14:32.600 --> 14:34.700
tell me the story
about how Eric and Donna

14:34.700 --> 14:36.800
had to stand up
in front of the whole church

14:36.800 --> 14:39.300
and pretend to be virgins.
Once upon a time,

14:39.300 --> 14:42.700
two dumb-asses went to church

14:42.700 --> 14:46.600
and brought shame
upon their entire family.

14:46.600 --> 14:49.000
And their father
had to hear about it

14:49.000 --> 14:52.400
the whole damn car ride home!

14:53.300 --> 14:55.200
That is a great story.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.300
It's scary,

14:56.300 --> 14:59.000
but it's funny, too.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.500
What I don't understand

15:00.500 --> 15:03.200
is how you can lie to a pastor
in church.

15:03.200 --> 15:04.600
Well, mrs. Forman,

15:04.600 --> 15:06.900
what about the time you lied
to pastor Dan?

15:06.900 --> 15:09.200
You told him your dog
ate your bake sale cookies,

15:09.200 --> 15:11.600
but you didn't bake them
'cause you were too busy

15:11.600 --> 15:14.300
sipping kahlÃºa and watching
that Paul Newman retrospective.

15:14.300 --> 15:16.300
I did not lie
to pastor Dan in church.

15:16.300 --> 15:17.900
I lied to him
at the market,

15:17.900 --> 15:21.900
and at the market,
he is just a regular man.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.500
Now you two march back to church
and tell him the truth.

15:25.500 --> 15:28.800
And for you information, Donna,
kahlÃºa is barely a drink.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.500
It's like root beer.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.200
So I can't believe
the police academy caught fire.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.400
What happened?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.900
Huge mystery.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.900
Like what part
of the cow is the hot dog?

15:47.600 --> 15:51.100
Maybe Kelso's just
too traumatized to remember.

15:51.100 --> 15:53.300
I think he needs help
filling in the blanks,

15:53.300 --> 15:57.000
like the fire was started
with a blank gun

15:57.000 --> 16:00.900
by a blanking idiot
named blank-O.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.800
Hey, Brooke,

16:02.800 --> 16:04.800
could you wait outside
for a minute?

16:04.800 --> 16:07.300
Mrs. Forman has this rule
that there's only...

16:07.300 --> 16:10.900
five people in the kitchen
at one time.

16:10.900 --> 16:12.800
Well,
there are five people here.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.400
That's why
you need to leave.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.400
But you said
no more than five.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.700
Right.
But I'm number five.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.000
Exactly.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.700
So I'll just
wait outside then?

16:22.700 --> 16:24.900
Attagirl.

16:26.700 --> 16:27.900
Hey, Jackie,

16:27.900 --> 16:30.100
I suspect Kelso
hasn't told Brooke

16:30.100 --> 16:32.200
that he burned down
the police academy.

16:32.200 --> 16:33.700
Interesting.

16:33.700 --> 16:36.700
I suspect you're right,
Steven.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.400
Fez, what do you think?

16:39.400 --> 16:40.400
I think

16:40.400 --> 16:43.000
I smell cookies.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.400
All right, fine,

16:45.400 --> 16:46.800
so I haven't told her.

16:46.800 --> 16:48.700
But the only reason
she likes me is

16:48.700 --> 16:50.800
'cause I'm doing well
at the academy.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.200
Michael, you can't start
a relationship based

16:53.200 --> 16:54.700
on a huge lie.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.300
You have to start off fresh,
and then gently sprinkle

16:57.300 --> 17:00.300
in the lies as you go along.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.400
A relationship
is like a cookie,

17:03.400 --> 17:07.700
and the lies
are the tasty chocolate chips.

17:07.700 --> 17:11.300
Where are the cookies,
damn it?

17:12.500 --> 17:15.000
Okay, what did you want
to tell me?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.700
Well, you see,
pastor Dan,

17:16.700 --> 17:18.500
when we were here before

17:18.500 --> 17:23.400
and you had asked us
about premarital sex,

17:23.400 --> 17:26.900
we might have--
we lied, okay?

17:28.300 --> 17:32.000
We have had sex
zillions of times.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.300
I used to try to keep track
on a pad,

17:34.300 --> 17:37.300
but it got unwieldy.
Oh, god.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.300
Eric!

17:38.300 --> 17:40.900
I'm sorry, Donna, but we are
knocking on hell's door,

17:40.900 --> 17:43.600
and I ain't goin' in!

17:43.600 --> 17:46.000
Eric,
you're not going to hell.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.400
But you might be.
I don't know you that well.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.700
I just think
you're depriving yourselves

17:51.700 --> 17:56.100
of that wonderful moment
when marriage is cemented

17:56.100 --> 17:59.600
by giving the gift
of yourselves.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.500
Wow.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.300
I never thought
about it that way.

18:03.300 --> 18:05.500
Maybe that's why
you couldn't figure out

18:05.500 --> 18:07.600
the whole excitement
about marriage.

18:07.600 --> 18:10.300
The one thing you should have
been looking forward to,

18:10.300 --> 18:12.700
you had already experienced.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.400
Maybe you knew that

18:14.400 --> 18:17.400
without realizing it.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.100
Um...

18:19.100 --> 18:23.400
I don't mean to bring up
Star Wars again.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.800
This is a lot like Luke

18:25.800 --> 18:29.000
before he discovered
the force.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.100
Exactly.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.400
And what is the force
in real life?

18:42.500 --> 18:44.700
Brooke...

18:45.000 --> 18:47.400
I gotta tell you something.

18:47.400 --> 18:50.200
I burnt down
the police academy auditorium.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.800
See, this flare
just got away from me.

18:52.800 --> 18:55.400
And then there was another flare
that was on purpose,

18:55.400 --> 18:59.100
but a bad idea,
and a final warning flare

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
that I now realize
was unnecessary,

19:01.100 --> 19:05.700
'cause the fire itself
was a pretty big flare.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.900
Well, michael,

19:06.900 --> 19:08.700
I'm glad you're honest
with me

19:08.700 --> 19:11.600
because I kind of
have a secret, too.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.600
You have a twin sister
that loves threesomes.

19:15.600 --> 19:17.100
No.

19:17.800 --> 19:20.200
I've stopped myself
from getting close to you

19:20.200 --> 19:23.600
because I didn't know
if I could trust you.

19:23.600 --> 19:26.100
I knew you were lying
about the police academy fire

19:26.100 --> 19:28.600
because, well,

19:28.600 --> 19:32.100
your friends kind of
gave it away in the kitchen.

19:32.100 --> 19:36.800
Also Fez took me aside today
and just told me.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.900
And kinda tried
to kiss me.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.600
Yeah, he does that.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.000
But you were honest
with me,

19:45.000 --> 19:48.500
which means
I can trust you now.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.500
So...

20:02.900 --> 20:05.200
is there anything else
you'd like to be honest

20:05.200 --> 20:07.200
with me about,

20:07.200 --> 20:10.700
like maybe
your test grades?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.200
Yeah.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.500
I didn't get four "bs."

20:18.500 --> 20:19.700
I kinda figured.

20:19.700 --> 20:23.400
I got four "as."
I just didn't want to brag.

20:29.700 --> 20:34.100
Well, we committed
seven mortal sins,

20:34.100 --> 20:36.700
and all we got
was a half an hour lecture.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.200
Yeah, but still,

20:39.200 --> 20:41.100
I want our wedding day
to be special.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.500
You know, something
we'll remember forever.

20:43.500 --> 20:45.100
You know what?

20:45.100 --> 20:46.500
Whatever it takes.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.800
Which is why I think
we shouldn't have sex again

20:48.800 --> 20:52.700
until we're married.
What? No. What? No.

20:52.700 --> 20:53.500
No, no, no, no.

20:53.600 --> 20:57.200
You can't cut me off now.
I'm addicted now.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.400
Look, Eric, I know
it seems like a crazy idea.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.200
Oh, I see your plan, lady.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.900
The first three years
are free, huh?

21:02.900 --> 21:04.900
Eric, it'll be great.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.000
When you think about it,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.800
it's really similar
to Star Wars

21:08.800 --> 21:11.700
and staying pure,
just like a Jedi.

21:11.700 --> 21:13.400
There's no such thing as Jedi.

21:13.400 --> 21:17.100
That's just a stupid movie!
God!

21:22.300 --> 21:26.500
Last sunday we recognized
we...sex

21:26.500 --> 21:32.700
It is my bad duty to report
that they were lying!

21:32.700 --> 21:38.500
to me, to their families
to god himself.

21:38.500 --> 21:42.400
So let their correct.. justice
Please stand

21:42.400 --> 21:44.500
Eric Forman and Donna Pincioti

21:49.800 --> 21:51.500
Amen
