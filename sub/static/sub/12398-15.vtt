NARRATOR:
Previously on Nikita:

00:03.837 --> 00:07.830
Seven years ago, I was taken off death
row and trained to be an assassin...

00:08.008 --> 00:10.465
...by a secret unit of the government
called Division.

00:10.636 --> 00:13.423
It was run by Percy,
who, after a failed power move...

00:13.597 --> 00:15.929
...was replaced by Amanda,
his second in command.

00:16.433 --> 00:19.220
Carla Bennett is priority target
number one.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.725
NIKITA:
Carla Bennett got me clean.

00:20.896 --> 00:24.639
She was the only good thing I had in my
life till Division made me who I am.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.603
ALEX: This is a standing kill order.
-First on the list.

00:27.778 --> 00:30.611
-Amanda wants this woman very dead.
-80 you are Division.

00:30.781 --> 00:32.646
It wasn't called that when l was there.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.692
When Nikita escaped, Percy and Amanda
said she was the first to ever escape.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.612
That's true.
Because I wasn't in the program.

00:40.082 --> 00:41.162
| created it.

00:52.135 --> 00:58.051
PERCY: Part of an old missile silo.
It's secure, out of view, underground.

00:58.225 --> 00:59.635
CARLA:
It's huge.

00:59.851 --> 01:04.220
In just one year, our program
has outgrown the old facility.

01:04.398 --> 01:09.233
I don't know, this is a lot bigger
than anything we ever discussed.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.314
It's time to think big.

01:11.488 --> 01:15.948
This is where our future begins, Carla.

01:37.097 --> 01:38.803
In those first days at Division...

01:38.974 --> 01:44.139
...when they were ripping out
the person I used to be...

01:47.649 --> 01:51.392
...| only survived
because of my memories of you.

01:53.405 --> 01:59.742
And now all of my memories are a lie.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.578
When I met you,
you were a confused kid...

02:03.749 --> 02:05.489
...and we were both on the run.

02:07.002 --> 02:10.915
You really think I should've told you the
truth about what I was running from?

02:11.340 --> 02:14.548
-lt's harder to hear now.
-Why?

02:14.718 --> 02:17.175
At least now you can believe me.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.048
How could you create something so evil,
Carla?

02:22.225 --> 02:24.511
Don't say that. It's not evil.

02:25.771 --> 02:27.807
l was saving lives.

02:27.981 --> 02:30.222
Lives that the system
was gonna throw away.

02:30.442 --> 02:34.435
Only to put them back into another
system that turned them into killers?

02:34.613 --> 02:37.025
That was Amanda. She is evil.

02:37.199 --> 02:41.488
She took my idea of transformation
and giving second chances...

02:41.662 --> 02:44.028
...and she corrupted it.

02:44.206 --> 02:48.415
Without her, it can be saved.
Everything can be saved.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.076
Why are you so focused on Amanda?

02:52.673 --> 02:54.959
Because she tried to have me killed.

[DOOR OPENS]

03:04.434 --> 03:06.265
[DOOR CLOSES]

03:09.356 --> 03:10.892
Where's your entourage?

03:11.066 --> 03:13.182
Securing the Stafford Arms
for the press.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.976
-We don't have much time.
-I know.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.232
Carla Bennett.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.987
Don't worry about her. We'll find her.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.572
-lt's over.
-No.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.659
ARI: Carla Bennett is with Nikita
which means it won't be long...

03:28.834 --> 03:32.326
...before Nikita learns your secret,
and we know what happens then.

03:33.088 --> 03:34.828
-Ari.
-I doubt Semak will bother...

03:35.006 --> 03:36.041
...to send an agent.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.582
He'll just come put the bullet in my head
himself.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.546
Ari, there's a way out of this.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.007
Yes, there is.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.012
But it requires a sacrifice
you will not want to make.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.267
Alex.

03:50.439 --> 03:52.555
Ugh, what do you think?

03:52.733 --> 03:56.521
Too downscale for the heir
to a multi-billion dollar fortune?

03:56.695 --> 03:58.310
Who's been missing seven years...

03:58.530 --> 04:02.022
...and just clawed her way out
of a human trafficking ring, remember?

04:02.409 --> 04:03.569
Right.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.156
-Where's Amanda?
-Out.

04:06.329 --> 04:09.821
I'm glad. She's been running us ragged
with this Carla Bennett search.

04:11.126 --> 04:12.491
ALEX:
What's the deal?

04:12.669 --> 04:14.660
SONYA:
Need-to-know. We 're all shut out.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.538
Let's go over the ConOps again.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.550
SONYA: Zetrov closed a deal
to buy the Corsairs.

04:22.721 --> 04:25.337
ALEX: The hockey team.
-lt's a major international purchase.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.889
Semak himself is going
to make the announcement.

04:28.059 --> 04:30.436
And the whole world will be watching.

04:30.604 --> 04:35.348
Perfect time for Alexandra Udinov
to make her return.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.735
What's the security like?

04:37.903 --> 04:40.986
Heavy. They've rented the entire hotel
for the press conference.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.772
Only accredited media allowed entry.

04:44.910 --> 04:47.242
Ari Tasarov will be running point
for Gogol...

04:47.412 --> 04:50.779
...after their last security chief
was let go.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.161
God, I hate that guy.

04:57.714 --> 05:00.706
BIRKHOFF: Look, lady, we've been trying
to crack Amanda for a while.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.749
She doesn't have any weak points.

Except for you.

05:05.096 --> 05:08.133
Come on, think.
What do you have on Amanda?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.015
I told you, I don't know.

05:11.186 --> 05:14.349
-She hated me from the start.
-That might explain why she tried...

05:14.523 --> 05:17.981
...to off you the first time, not why
she's devoted to taking you down now.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.642
She's afraid of you
or something you know about her.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.561
That's what Percy seems to think.

05:22.739 --> 05:24.730
NIKITA:
And we all know he'd never lie.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.035
Percy wants to take Amanda down
just as much as you do.

05:30.205 --> 05:33.288
-You do wanna take her down, right?
-I wanna take down Division.

05:33.458 --> 05:36.040
And Percy wants it back.
There's a difference.

Operation Alexandra is a go.

05:49.224 --> 05:51.465
Good. You ready?

05:51.643 --> 05:52.849
Guess so.

05:53.019 --> 05:56.728
It's weird. I feel like I'm about to tell
everyone I'm Iron Man or something.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.605
Well, yeah,
you've been in hiding a long time.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.813
It's gonna feel weird
stepping into the light.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.603
Just remember...

06:05.282 --> 06:06.818
...I got your back.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.361
Always.

06:11.288 --> 06:14.621
-Thank you.
-Now tell me about your approach.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.784
-Nikita has someone on the inside?
-Heh.

06:18.962 --> 06:22.671
-lt's a long story.
-Nikita saved her, turned her life around.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.964
Guess it's not that long.

06:25.176 --> 06:29.840
If this Alex is on the inside, why don't
you use her to get to Amanda?

06:30.015 --> 06:33.178
Uh, too dangerous. If she survived
the attempt, she'd never escape alive.

06:33.351 --> 06:37.060
Well, maybe she could poke around
and get Amanda to tell her the secret.

06:37.230 --> 06:40.142
-I doubt Amanda would tell anyone.
NIKITA: They're right.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.526
If we're gonna find this thing Amanda's
afraid of, it's going to be through you.

06:44.696 --> 06:48.530
So start from the beginning.
Tell us everything we don't know.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.565
We've got time.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.905
We are out of time.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.242
Semak must be dealt with
before he learns the truth.

06:57.709 --> 07:02.169
And the only way you can think
to accomplish that is for Alex to die?

07:02.339 --> 07:03.579
[SIGHS]

07:03.757 --> 07:06.294
We could kill Semak.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.380
And then we would be left
with nothing.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.720
No, this is the only way.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.732
We were going to rule an empire.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.737
Now what will we have?

is 300 million.

07:36.373 --> 07:39.206

for Alex's death...

07:39.376 --> 07:41.617
...there'll be a period of chaos
within Zetrov.

07:41.795 --> 07:44.958

anyone noticing and we're away.

She's come so far, only to suffer the
same fate she escaped seven years ago.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.063
It's not ideal.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.481
But it is either her or me.

Relax. I'm not gonna arrest you.

08:34.806 --> 08:38.048
I don't know what you're talking about.

08:50.822 --> 08:54.314

but you have discovered a method...

08:54.492 --> 08:56.153
...of creating deniable assets.

You work for the government?

And so can you.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.831
Think about it.

09:08.006 --> 09:12.249
Instead of breaking the law, you could
get federal funding for your project.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.795
As opposed to doing yard work,
or whatever...

09:15.972 --> 09:18.213
...your people
could be serving their country.

You mean like soldiers?

CARLA: In the beginning,
it was just Percy and me.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.650
We started out of a back office in DC.

09:30.820 --> 09:34.062
And after some early successes,
he wanted to expand.

-Get a bigger sponsor and he found one.
-Oversight.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.152

It was a codename for the group.

09:40.330 --> 09:41.615
It was illegal.

I didn't know that.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.791
I just identified the candidates
for renewal.

09:47.629 --> 09:49.620
When did Amanda get involved?

09:49.798 --> 09:54.041
Well, like I said,
Percy wanted to expand.

09:55.386 --> 09:59.095
This is a lot bigger
than anything we ever discussed.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.256
It's time to think big.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.847
This is where our future begins, Carla.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.138
And if you're concerned about
the increased workload...

10:10.527 --> 10:12.643
...I've already taken that into account.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.399
Carla, this is Amanda.

10:15.573 --> 10:19.566
A rising star in PsyOps.

10:20.078 --> 10:24.697
Percy's told me of your work.
Very impressive, for a layman.

10:24.916 --> 10:28.283
Amanda's already got some ideas
about how to set up our home here.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.543
All active operations
will be run up here...

10:30.713 --> 10:34.126
...with a lower level dedicated
to recruit training and living space.

No. Recruits will not be segregated.

They need to see agents coming
and going, heading into the real world.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.763
They need to see
what they can become.

10:42.934 --> 10:45.767
-This isn't a summer camp.
CARLA: It's also not a prison.

10:45.937 --> 10:49.020
They need hope or they'll die.

10:49.315 --> 10:51.180
Even a layman can tell you that.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.568
This is good. Nothing worthwhile
comes without friction.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.569
You'll make a great team.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.700
CARLA: We were at each other's throats
from that day on.

11:01.870 --> 11:05.704
But still I was surprised
when she sent someone to kill me.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.956
I didn't think she would take it that far.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.122
But she made one mistake.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.787
She sent Brian to do the deed.

11:13.965 --> 11:16.547
-Bnan?
-One of my firsts.

11:19.179 --> 11:22.888
Brian told me that Amanda
had doctored evidence...

11:23.057 --> 11:26.470
...made it look like
I was gonna go to Congress...

11:26.644 --> 11:28.976
...blow the whistle on Percy,
expose the program.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.762
It's why he approved the hit.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.352
But Brian was one of mine.

11:34.986 --> 11:38.228
And he said that he would go back
and tell everyone that l was dead.

11:39.407 --> 11:40.522
He gave me time to run.

11:43.828 --> 11:46.160
So Amanda thought you were gone.

11:47.790 --> 11:50.702
She must have been shocked
when your print came up on my gun.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.869
Wait a minute.
Yeah, yeah. I remember this.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.256
She came, uh, storming into Ops
freaking out about a, uh, print match.

11:58.426 --> 11:59.836
Wanted me to triple check it.

12:00.011 --> 12:02.844
Make sure the cops hadn't screwed up
the chain of evidence.

12:03.014 --> 12:06.131
She was looking for confirmation
that you were truly alive.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.391
And because of the time
we spent together...

12:08.561 --> 12:11.394
...you were the only one
that could tell her for sure.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.897
Do you remember what Amanda was like
when you first met her?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.525
Do you remember
what she asked you about?

12:17.695 --> 12:19.356
I don't think about those days.

12:21.199 --> 12:25.533
If you're serious about trying
to figure out what she was afraid of...

12:27.121 --> 12:28.577
...you're gonna have to.

-Can I help you?
-How would you like to win a Pulitzer?

12:53.189 --> 12:55.145
-She's made contact.
SONYA [OVER COMM]: Copy that.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.022
Alex has completed phase one.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.435
Good. Make sure all mobile units
continue providing backup.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.820
Is there any progress
on tracking Carla?

13:02.991 --> 13:05.733
-No, search grids still come up empty.
-Ugh.

13:05.994 --> 13:09.828
The level of incompetence around here
can be breathtaking.

13:09.998 --> 13:13.957
Perhaps we need some cancellations
to properly motivate all of you.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.745
NIKITA:
