00:01.268 --> 00:03.337
GILES:
 Previously on
Buffy The Vampire Slayer...

00:03.371 --> 00:08.576
We had to hide the key.
Made it human
and sent it to you.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.378
Did you know your sister
took my key, Dawnie?
And she won't give it back.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.048
I bet you know where she put it,
don't you?

00:14.082 --> 00:15.483
She doesn't know anything.

00:15.516 --> 00:18.152
Okay. Let's see who you are.

00:18.185 --> 00:22.756
The Knights of Byzantium,
an ancient order,
are now your enemy.

00:22.789 --> 00:29.329
So long as you protect the key,
the brotherhood will never stop
until we destroy it and you.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.765
Look at you.
All afraid I'm hot
for your honey.

00:31.798 --> 00:33.401
RILEY:
 Because you are.

00:33.433 --> 00:36.270
Well, yeah.

00:36.304 --> 00:38.405
Just tell me what kind
of demon I'm fighting.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.908
-Glory isn't a demon.
-What is she?

00:40.941 --> 00:43.944
She's a god.

00:43.976 --> 00:46.880
Look, I know Mom wants
to gather and make with
the merry tomorrow night,

00:46.979 --> 00:48.582
but with everything
that's going on--

00:48.615 --> 00:50.551
This is exactly
what you need.

00:50.584 --> 00:55.088
A 20th birthday party
with, with presents
and funny hats,

00:55.122 --> 00:57.191
and, and those candles
that don't blow out.

00:57.225 --> 00:59.393
Those used
to scare me.
Me too.

00:59.426 --> 01:01.695
I just don't think
this is the best time
to break out the party piÃ±ata.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.697
We need to stay focused
if we're gonna find
a way to stop Glory.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.466
We're going up against a god.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.602
An actual
mightier-than-thou god.

01:08.635 --> 01:10.870
Well, you know
what they say,
the bigger they are-

01:10.903 --> 01:13.073
The faster they stomp
you into nothing.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.576
BUFFY:
She's right.

01:16.609 --> 01:18.445
I mean, I've thrown everything
I've got at her,
and she just shrugs it off.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.548
Then we have to find
something heavier to throw.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.117
GILES:
Well, that might pose
some difficulty.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.385
From what the council's
been able to discover from
the Book of Tarnis ,

01:25.418 --> 01:29.489
and, and other sources,
Glory and two of
her fellow hell-gods...

01:29.522 --> 01:33.793
Ruled over one of the more
seriously unpleasant
demon dimensions.

01:33.826 --> 01:36.129
-There's more than one?
-Oh, there are thousands
of demon dimensions.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.799
-All different.
-All pushing on the edges
of our reality,

01:38.831 --> 01:41.902
trying to find a way in.
I guess Glory found one.

01:41.935 --> 01:45.472
-The question is, why?
-GILES: There's nothing
to indicate that here.

01:45.506 --> 01:49.810
Just vague references
to chaos and destruction.
(teakettle whistling)

01:49.843 --> 01:53.146
Okay, so, we know
where Glory's from.
What do we know about her?

01:53.180 --> 01:56.650
You know, she's tough, yeah,
but, but no bolts of lightning,
no blasts of fire.

01:56.683 --> 01:58.786
Shouldn't a god be able
to do that kind of stuff?

01:58.819 --> 02:01.921
Well, usually, yes.
But, um, being in human form...

02:01.954 --> 02:04.123
must be severely
limiting her powers.

02:04.158 --> 02:08.961
All we have to worry about right
now is that she's immortal,
invulnerable and insane.

02:08.996 --> 02:13.501
A crazy hell-god?
And the fun
just keeps on leaving!

02:13.533 --> 02:16.469
From what I've been able
to gather, her living
in this world...

02:16.503 --> 02:19.507
is seriously affecting
her mental state
as well.

02:19.539 --> 02:21.675
She's only being able
to keep her mind intact...

02:21.709 --> 02:23.977
by extracting energy
from us.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.479
Well,
from, from the human brain.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.649
She's-she's
a brain-sucker?

02:28.681 --> 02:31.852
She, um, absorbs
the energies that
bind the human mind...

02:31.884 --> 02:34.487
into a cohesive whole.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.456
Once drained,
all that's left behind
is, uh--

02:36.490 --> 02:38.658
Crazy people.
Which is,
I'm afraid, why...

02:38.692 --> 02:42.962
there's been a marked increase
in the ranks of the mentally
unstable here in Sunnydale.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.199
At least vampires
just kill you.

02:45.233 --> 02:47.235
We have to find
a way to stop her.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.471
Oh, well, Tara and I
can work on some
tactical spells.

02:50.503 --> 02:53.139
I can do some research.
I know way more...

02:53.173 --> 02:56.644
About demon dimensions
than Giles does.

02:56.676 --> 03:00.146
Well, I do.
This is great
long-term plan-y stuff,

03:00.180 --> 03:03.015
but what about
this key thingy
Glory's looking for?

03:03.050 --> 03:06.354
TARA: Yeah, I mean,
shouldn't we be trying to
find it before she does?

03:06.387 --> 03:08.389
I don't think that's
what we should be
worrying about right now.

03:08.421 --> 03:12.725
They've got a point.
Whatever Glory's planning on
opening with the key,

03:12.759 --> 03:16.430
I'm guessing it won't
be filled with
candy and flowers.

03:16.463 --> 03:19.233
XANDER: So where should
we start looking? Do we know
where it used to be kept?

03:19.266 --> 03:22.436
-Who saw it last?
-We did.

03:22.469 --> 03:26.340
Giles and me.
We, we know where it is.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.610
-You what?
-You know,
and you didn't tell us?

03:29.643 --> 03:31.912
There were reasons.

03:31.944 --> 03:36.417
Look, if, if Glory knew
that you guys knew
where it was, I--

03:36.449 --> 03:38.519
I just didn't want
to put you in
that kind of danger.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.355
As opposed to
the other kind
we're always in?

03:42.389 --> 03:45.293
-You should have
said something.
-Wil, there--

03:49.763 --> 03:51.664
You're right.

03:53.734 --> 03:58.572
-It's time.
-Are you sure?

03:58.605 --> 04:00.973
They're gonna
be risking their lives.
They deserve to know.

04:01.008 --> 04:02.509
Know what?

04:06.580 --> 04:10.584
There's something that
you need to know about Dawn.

04:10.617 --> 04:13.120
KNIGHT:
The link must be severed.

04:13.152 --> 04:15.389
Such is the will of God.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.759
ALL:
The key is the link.
The link must be severed.

04:18.791 --> 04:20.961
Such is the will of God.

04:20.994 --> 04:25.598
The key is the link.
The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

04:25.632 --> 04:28.435
JINX: You really think
He's going to help you?

04:28.468 --> 04:32.305
I fear your faith
is gravely misplaced.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.507
(selling, shouting)

05:01.634 --> 05:03.536
Shall we test
your faith now?

05:09.677 --> 05:12.144
Never send a minion
to do a god's work.

05:29.161 --> 05:30.262
Hey, nice sword.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.367
Bet it hurts.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.606
(theme music playing)

06:41.000 --> 06:43.737
-You guys doing a spell?
-Dawn, hey.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.939
Yeah, we're doing
an early warning incantation.

06:46.973 --> 06:48.776
If anything
hell-godishly powerful...

06:48.808 --> 06:50.877
comes within
100 feet of the shop,

06:50.911 --> 06:55.048
then screechy siren things
will, you know, screech.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.651
This should give us a heads up
so we can hide the, um, key.

06:58.685 --> 07:01.654
We already put one up
around your house.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.591
Cool. Can I help?

07:04.625 --> 07:07.093
Well, I don't think
Buffy would like
the black arts...

07:07.127 --> 07:10.197
bumping auras with
the littlest Summers.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.468
Yeah. Whatever.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.004
How can she not
be real?

07:18.038 --> 07:22.341
She's real.
She's just kind of... new.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.315
Hey!
We on the case?

07:29.348 --> 07:32.185
Yeah!
Right on top, perched,
ready for action.

07:32.218 --> 07:35.988
How's my sweet,
fancy Dawn doing?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.591
(giggling) Fine.
What's up with you?

07:38.625 --> 07:40.494
Did you get into
the sugar again?

07:40.528 --> 07:42.629
You make a very
pretty little girl.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.199
Anya, you want
to help me with that thing?

07:47.233 --> 07:49.201
Xander needs help
with his thing!

07:53.973 --> 07:55.776
GILES:
I'm not sure
our regular workout...

07:55.808 --> 07:57.810
is challenging you
anymore.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.846
Perhaps we should
make it harder.

07:59.879 --> 08:02.182
You always think
harder is better.

08:02.214 --> 08:05.853
Maybe next time I patrol,
I should carry a load of bricks
and use a stake made of butter.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.387
(chuckles) Very amusing.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.824
I'm sure Dawn feels that way
about her schoolwork sometimes.

08:11.858 --> 08:14.226
That true?
How was school today?

08:14.261 --> 08:16.163
Um, the usual.
Big square building,

08:16.196 --> 08:18.464
filled with boredom
and despair.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.668
BUFFY:
Just how I remember it.

08:20.701 --> 08:23.704
So, what's
the homework sitch?

08:23.737 --> 08:26.206
We have to imagine
what we'll be like
ten years from now,

08:26.238 --> 08:28.141
and write a letter
to our future self.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.978
The teacher is clearly
so out of ideas.
Wanna help?

08:31.011 --> 08:34.212
Maybe later.
I have some stuff
I have to do first.

08:34.246 --> 08:36.850
Is it about
that weird girl
that came to the house?

08:36.884 --> 08:39.019
Glory.
And, no, it's not.
(cash register dings)

08:39.052 --> 08:42.722
Like you'd tell me anyway.
"Dawn's too young"
and "Dawn's too delicate."

08:42.755 --> 08:45.558
Right. A young,
delicate pain in my butt.

08:45.592 --> 08:48.495
I just think you're freaking out
'cause you have to fight
someone prettier than you.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.397
That is the case,
right?

08:52.899 --> 08:56.202
Glory is evil
and powerful,

08:56.235 --> 08:58.004
and in no way
prettier than me.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.072
I just think you're getting
soft in your advanced age.

09:00.106 --> 09:02.610
She didn't look
that tough to me.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.845
Okay, one more time.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.716
Just between me and you,

09:08.749 --> 09:12.451
our itsy-bitsy
little secret.

09:14.654 --> 09:18.225
Where is the key?

09:18.258 --> 09:21.293
Even if I knew,
I'd die a thousand deaths
before I'd tell you.

09:21.327 --> 09:24.898
Well, you won't need
a thousand, sweetie.

09:24.932 --> 09:29.001
I'll make the first
one last a long time.

09:31.605 --> 09:34.073
What is it
with you religious types?

09:36.475 --> 09:40.113
-(weapon hits ground)
-It's intimacy,
isn't it?

09:40.147 --> 09:44.216
Oh! You're just scared
of letting someone in.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.821
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

09:47.855 --> 09:51.258
I know how difficult
the first time can be.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.662
You don't have
to be afraid.

09:54.695 --> 09:58.130
Just relax.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.366
You may not have
the info I want,

10:02.335 --> 10:05.371
but you still got
something I need.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.378
(groaning)

10:15.948 --> 10:19.152
Prezzies!
See?
Just what you needed.

10:19.186 --> 10:22.154
You are very, very wise.
Now, gimme, gimme, gimme!

10:23.956 --> 10:27.695
This is extremely suspenseful.
I want the presents.

10:29.062 --> 10:32.932
Oh! It's beautiful.
Thank you, guys.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.368
Oh, we thought you get
lots of crossbows
and other killy stuff.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.870
Yeah, so we figured
less killy, more frilly.

10:39.538 --> 10:43.009
Gotta look.
Oh, it's just so lovely!

10:43.043 --> 10:45.077
Oh, I wish it was mine.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.350
Oh, like you
weren't all thinking
the same thing.

10:50.383 --> 10:53.120
I'm fairly certain
I wasn't.
I've got one just like it.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.389
Here. Open mine.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.990
It's not gonna explode,
is it?

11:01.828 --> 11:04.965
It's when we visited Dad
that summer in San Diego.

11:04.998 --> 11:08.567
Um, I put the shells
on it myself.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.871
We picked them
off the beach.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.774
I remember.

11:20.279 --> 11:23.316
Well, geez, don't get all
movie-of-the-week.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.886
I was just too cheap
to buy you a real present.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.289
Thank you.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.399
It still seems to me
 like there's a lot
 you don't know about this.

11:40.432 --> 11:42.870
I mean,
is she dangerous?
No.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.904
GILES:
Well, now wait just a second.

11:44.937 --> 11:47.908
I assume you're talking
about her existence
rather than her intentions.

11:47.941 --> 11:52.711
Exactly.
Dawn? What are you doing
in there?

11:52.745 --> 11:56.817
Party getting slow?
Uh, we need plates.
It's cake time.

12:08.660 --> 12:11.431
Why does everybody
start acting all weird
when I'm around?

12:11.464 --> 12:15.268
Me?
Me not weird.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.270
I'm not an idiot.
I know you're
talking about me.

12:18.304 --> 12:22.575
No, no, we really weren't.
We were talking
about sex.

12:22.609 --> 12:25.111
They were
talking about me,
just like everybody is.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.614
Again, not so much.
In fact, none.

12:27.647 --> 12:30.216
We were talking
about sex.
I mean, you know us.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.719
Sometimes we like
to pretend stuff.
Anya--

12:32.751 --> 12:36.456
-You know, like, say there's
a fireman or a shepherd--
-BUFFY: You know what?

12:36.489 --> 12:38.792
Let's not have this
exchange of images
right now.

12:38.826 --> 12:42.495
Oh, right. Of course.
Can't let Dawn
hear anything.

12:42.528 --> 12:44.965
Fine. I'm just
gonna go to bed.

12:44.998 --> 12:48.534
That way I won't
accidentally get exposed
to, like, words.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.209
Cake?

13:30.543 --> 13:34.014
(gasps)
Geez! Lurk much?

13:34.047 --> 13:38.451
I wasn't lurking.
I was standing about.
It's a whole different vibe.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.386
What is--

13:43.190 --> 13:45.859
Are you giving Buffy
a birthday present?

13:45.893 --> 13:48.028
Oh, my god. Weird.

13:48.061 --> 13:51.730
And chocolates? Lame.
And the box is all bent.

13:51.764 --> 13:56.369
And, well, you know
she'd never touch
anything from you anyway.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.038
Shouldn't you
be tucked away
in your beddy-bye?

13:59.072 --> 14:02.975
All warm and safe where
nothing can eat you?
(giggling)

14:03.009 --> 14:05.011
Is that supposed
to scare me?

14:05.044 --> 14:07.147
(sighs)

14:07.179 --> 14:09.182
A little tremble
wouldn't hurt.
Sorry.

14:09.216 --> 14:13.153
It's just, come on.
I'm badder than you.

14:13.186 --> 14:17.157
Are not.
Am too. You're
standing in the bushes,

14:17.190 --> 14:20.659
hugging a bent box
of chocolates, and I'm--
What?

14:20.692 --> 14:23.931
Sneaking out to braid hair
and watch Teletubbies
with your mates?

14:23.963 --> 14:26.832
No.

14:26.865 --> 14:32.004
I'm breaking into
the magic shop.
To steal things.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.941
Magic shop, eh?

14:37.376 --> 14:40.846
A whole number of beasties
between here and there.

14:40.879 --> 14:44.417
Bet they'd really go for
a Little Red Riding Hood
like you.

14:44.451 --> 14:46.885
That wouldn't set too well
with big sister.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.789
I can take care of myself.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.631
You want to come
steal some stuff?
Yeah, all right.

15:06.139 --> 15:09.142
Do you know
how to do that or not?
Give us a sec.

15:09.176 --> 15:11.543
I usually just
burst through doors.

15:11.577 --> 15:13.712
-(latch unlocks)
-That's right.

15:13.745 --> 15:16.515
Who's bad now?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.452
Girl with a mission, eh?
What's the caper?

15:20.486 --> 15:22.554
Jewels?
Ancient artifacts?

15:22.588 --> 15:25.325
Or just plain hard cash
liberated from the till?

15:25.357 --> 15:29.261
-A book.
-All this for a book?

15:29.296 --> 15:31.965
I don't want the book.
Just what's inside.

15:31.999 --> 15:36.302
I think
it was Giles's notes.

15:36.336 --> 15:40.307
He was standing here,
and when I turned around
it was gone.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.815
(giggles)

15:48.847 --> 15:52.284
Where did he learn
to write so bloody small,
from a fruit fly?

15:52.318 --> 15:54.653
Wait.
Here's something.

15:54.687 --> 15:57.024
Uh, "Tarnis,
12th century.

15:57.057 --> 15:59.591
"One of the founders
of the monks
of the Order of Dagon.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.029
Their sole purpose
appears to have been
as protectors of the key."

16:03.062 --> 16:06.099
(snickers)
Brown-robe types are always
protecting something.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.868
It's the only way
they can justify
giving up girls.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.970
Hey!

16:11.004 --> 16:13.005
Troll hammer.
(grunts)

16:13.039 --> 16:14.874
(metal clunking)

16:16.543 --> 16:18.977
Didn't go with my stuff
anyway.

16:19.011 --> 16:21.347
"The key
is not directly described
in any known literature,

16:21.380 --> 16:23.850
"but all research indicates
an energy matrix...

16:23.883 --> 16:26.153
"vibrating at
a dimensional frequency...

16:26.186 --> 16:28.154
"beyond normal
human perception.

16:28.187 --> 16:32.524
Only those outside reality
can see the key's
true nature."

16:32.558 --> 16:35.794
"Outside reality."
What's that mean?

16:35.827 --> 16:38.831
Second-sight blokes,
mostly.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.033
Or even just your
run-of-the-mill lunatics.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.804
MAN:
You don't belong here.

16:45.837 --> 16:49.241
-There!
There's no one in there.
-I know what you are.

16:49.275 --> 16:51.977
SPIKE:
What else does it say
about this key?

16:52.010 --> 16:56.216
Is it made out of gold?
Maybe we could hock it,
split the take.

16:56.249 --> 17:01.520
Um, "The key
is also susceptible to
necromanced animal detection,

17:01.553 --> 17:04.522
particularly those
of canine
or serpent construct."

17:07.026 --> 17:08.861
-(screaming)
-(hissing)

17:14.601 --> 17:18.171
"The monks
possessed the ability
to transform energy.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.406
Bend reality."

17:20.440 --> 17:22.608
Blah, blah, blah.

17:22.642 --> 17:26.944
Good lord.
Giles writes as dull
as he talks, doesn't he?

17:26.979 --> 17:30.717
"They started work,
but the council...

17:30.750 --> 17:34.886
"has suggested to us
that they were interrupted,

17:34.921 --> 17:38.924
"presumably by... Glory.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.761
"They obviously did manage
to accomplish the taste.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.464
"Accomplish the task.

17:45.498 --> 17:48.335
"They had to be certain
the Slayer would
protect it with her life.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.539
"So they sent the key
to her,

17:53.573 --> 17:55.642
"in human form.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.846
In the form of a sister."

18:04.750 --> 18:07.854
Huh. I guess
that's you, nibblet.

18:17.028 --> 18:20.098
Not even a card, huh?

18:20.133 --> 18:24.237
I wasn't really
expecting one.
No contact with civilians.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.638
There's probably
a code name for it.

18:26.673 --> 18:30.242
You know,
like radio silence.
It's greeting card silence.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.612
Sorry.

18:32.644 --> 18:35.914
Maybe it's time to start
a new tradition,
birthdays without boyfriends.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.916
It could be
just as much fun.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.619
Preaching to the choir
here, baby.

18:40.653 --> 18:44.790
Yeah, some of my best--
Oh, oh, my god.

18:50.529 --> 18:53.633
-Is this blood?
-BUFFY: Dawn!

18:53.665 --> 18:56.102
JOYCE:
Oh, baby!

18:56.134 --> 18:59.306
What did you do?

18:59.338 --> 19:01.340
This is blood,
isn't it?

19:01.374 --> 19:04.477
It can't be me.
I'm not a key.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.846
I'm not a thing.

19:06.878 --> 19:10.549
Oh, sweetie, no.
What is this all about?
What am I?

19:10.583 --> 19:13.118
Am I real?

19:13.152 --> 19:15.086
Am I anything?

19:20.759 --> 19:23.563
-If you need anything--
-Thanks.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.405
Perhaps I should stay.
You know, just in case?

19:33.440 --> 19:38.044
This is a family thing.
We should deal with this.
Okay.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.093
Why didn't you tell me?

19:56.262 --> 19:58.730
We were going to.
I just--

20:02.634 --> 20:06.137
We thought it would be better if
we waited until you were older.

20:07.606 --> 20:09.675
How old am I now?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.877
You're 14, sweetheart.
You know that.

20:11.911 --> 20:14.381
No. The monks.

20:14.413 --> 20:17.717
When did--
When did they--

20:20.553 --> 20:22.622
Six months ago.

20:25.625 --> 20:29.095
I've only been alive
for six months, huh?

20:29.127 --> 20:31.364
You've been alive
a lot longer than that to us.

20:31.397 --> 20:35.233
You don't know that!
You don't know anything.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.269
I'm, I'm just a key,
right?

20:37.304 --> 20:39.538
Everything about me
is made up.

20:39.572 --> 20:42.541
Dawn...

20:42.575 --> 20:45.311
Mom and I know
what we feel.

20:45.345 --> 20:47.614
I know I care about you.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.415
I know that I worry
about you.

20:49.449 --> 20:51.817
You worry about me
because you have to.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.554
I'm your job.
Protect the key, right?

20:54.586 --> 20:58.825
I worry because my sister
is cutting herself.
Yeah? How do you know?

20:58.857 --> 21:01.993
Maybe it's
just another fake memory
from my fake family.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.997
-Sweetheart.
-Get out.

21:05.030 --> 21:08.134
-Dawn.
-Get out, get out.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.201
Get out!

21:17.844 --> 21:19.244
BUFFY: We need answers, Giles.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.814
We need to find out everything
we can about the key.

21:21.847 --> 21:23.849
What's it for,
who created it.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.952
And why Glory has
a big girl-god jones for it.

21:26.986 --> 21:30.122
This isn't about her.
It's about Dawn.

21:30.155 --> 21:32.023
She deserves to know
where she came from.

21:32.057 --> 21:34.093
She needs to know,

21:34.125 --> 21:36.295
or it's just gonna
eat away at her.

21:36.328 --> 21:38.130
How did she find these?

21:38.163 --> 21:40.132
-How did she get in here in--
-Eww!

21:40.165 --> 21:43.836
Who's been using
the Urn of Ishtar
as an ashtray?

21:48.540 --> 21:50.977
Morning, sunshine.
If you've come around
for eggs or sausage,

21:51.009 --> 21:53.512
I'm fresh out.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.714
Hey, careful!
These are wet.

21:57.549 --> 21:59.719
How could you let her
find out like that?

21:59.751 --> 22:03.355
From books and papers?
You hate me that much?

22:03.390 --> 22:06.792
I was just
along for the ride.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.295
Not like I knew she was
mystical glowy key thing.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.564
Nobody keeps me
in the bloody loop, do they?

22:13.566 --> 22:15.300
You could have
stopped her.

22:15.334 --> 22:18.136
Oh, yeah.
Here it comes.

22:18.170 --> 22:21.339
Something goes wrong
in your life, blame Spike.

22:21.374 --> 22:24.276
Newsflash, Blondie.

22:25.944 --> 22:28.314
If kid sis wants to grab
a midnight stroll,

22:28.346 --> 22:30.482
she'll find a way
sooner or later.

22:30.517 --> 22:34.621
I just thought she'd be safer
with Big Bad looking
over her shoulder.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.594
She shouldn't have
found out like that.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.864
You didn't think
you could keep the truth
from her forever, did you?

22:44.896 --> 22:47.534
Maybe if you had been
more honest with her
in the first place,

22:47.567 --> 22:50.636
you wouldn't be trying to
make yourself feel better with
a round of Kick the Spike.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.542
(door opens, closes)

22:58.376 --> 23:00.278
(knock on door)

23:03.082 --> 23:06.586
Honey?
You're gonna be
late for school.

23:08.755 --> 23:10.355
I'm not going.

23:10.388 --> 23:13.492
Blobs of energy
don't need an education.

23:15.994 --> 23:18.130
You want me
to make you some soup?

23:18.163 --> 23:22.034
-I think there's
some chicken and stars--
-I'm not sick!

23:22.067 --> 23:25.304
-I'm not anything.
-Honey, calm down, okay?

23:25.336 --> 23:27.973
Don't tell me what to do.

23:29.174 --> 23:31.176
You're not my mother.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.819
I changed my mind.

23:40.853 --> 23:43.088
I would rather be at school.

23:54.834 --> 23:58.269
All right, fellas.
Today we've got blues, greens,

23:58.304 --> 24:00.640
and, ooh, hey,
chartreuse.

24:00.673 --> 24:04.810
It's a party.
It won't stick.
(chuckles)

24:04.844 --> 24:08.580
The birds have been
pecking too long.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.182
-Byzantium.
-JINX: Yes.

24:11.217 --> 24:15.320
They've arrived. Unfortunate,
but not completely unexpected.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.990
How many?
Their numbers are few
for the moment,

24:18.023 --> 24:19.826
but they'll grow.

24:19.858 --> 24:22.461
The Knights of Byzantium
are like ants.

24:22.494 --> 24:27.500
First you see one, then two,
then the picnic's ruined.

24:27.534 --> 24:32.270
No matter how many we kill,
they'll keep coming,
wave after wave.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.040
It's time to set
old animosities aside.

24:35.074 --> 24:38.877
Your fate is directly linked
to her magnificently scented
Glorificus.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.212
She's been
extremely forgiving...

24:41.247 --> 24:43.449
of your considerable foibles
up until now.

24:43.481 --> 24:46.451
But if you persist
in your defiance,
she'll be forced to--

24:46.484 --> 24:49.521
To what?
What is she going to do?

24:49.556 --> 24:53.358
Send a six-pack of minions
to bore me to death?

24:53.392 --> 24:55.361
Glory can't lay
a finger on me.

24:55.394 --> 24:58.130
You know it. I know it.
She knows it.

24:58.163 --> 25:02.535
So save the threats,
or I'll finish the job
I started on your head.

25:29.095 --> 25:32.598
We can't just let her
sit up there all alone.

25:32.632 --> 25:36.367
She needs time.
We can't force her
to be all right with this.

25:38.069 --> 25:39.905
That's your answer?

25:39.939 --> 25:42.674
Just leave her alone and
hope everything works
itself out?

25:42.709 --> 25:45.912
No. But if I were her,
I'd want a little bit
of time right now.

25:45.944 --> 25:49.548
I wouldn't want
my mother and my sister
coming at me from all sides.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.854
Her school called today.
She was suspended.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.624
She yelled at a teacher.
The things she said, Buffy.

25:57.656 --> 26:00.192
I mean, she's never
used language like that.

26:00.226 --> 26:04.029
BUFFY:
She probably feels like she can
say or do anything right now.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.699
She's not real.
We're not her family.

26:06.732 --> 26:09.234
We don't even know
what she is.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.848
(screaming)

26:55.948 --> 26:58.917
-How can you talk about Dawn
as if she's a thing?
-I'm not!

26:58.951 --> 27:01.953
I'm just saying
that's probably
how she feels.

27:01.988 --> 27:04.522
Well, then,
we have to show her
that it isn't true.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.292
She needs to know that she's
still a part of this family
and that we love her.

27:07.326 --> 27:10.561
It's not that simple.
We're not gonna be able
to fix this...

27:10.663 --> 27:12.832
with a hug and a kiss
and a bowl of soup.

27:12.865 --> 27:15.300
Dawn needs to know
where she came from.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.536
She needs real answers.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.606
What she needs
is her sister, Buffy,

27:21.640 --> 27:24.009
not the Slayer.

27:24.042 --> 27:27.212
The Slayer
is the only thing
standing between Dawn...

27:27.246 --> 27:29.381
and this god from
the bitch dimension...

27:29.414 --> 27:31.683
that wants to shove her
in some kind of lock
and give her a good twirl.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.720
Mom, I need to be
out there...

27:33.752 --> 27:35.988
-doing my jo--
-(alarm blaring)

27:36.021 --> 27:40.092
-Oh, my god. Glory.
It's Willow's spell.
-Wait. It's not Glory.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.630
Damn it!

27:44.663 --> 27:47.066
-Dawn!
-Buffy.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.867
No! No, she could have
burned the house down.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.670
Buffy, she's gone.

27:59.746 --> 28:02.513
She tore up her room.
She burned all of her diaries.

28:02.548 --> 28:04.682
The Dawnmeister Chronicles?

28:04.717 --> 28:07.753
She's been keeping
those since, I mean--

28:08.954 --> 28:13.192
Since she was seven.
I remember too, Wil.

28:13.224 --> 28:15.761
BUFFY:
We have to find her,
and fast.

28:15.795 --> 28:20.598
Before Glory or the Knights
of Hack and Slash
figure out what--

28:20.632 --> 28:22.268
Who she really is.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.670
Mom's gonna stay at home
in case she shows up.

28:24.702 --> 28:27.573
I figure we split up
and sweep the city.

28:27.605 --> 28:30.276
Anya, will you stay here
in case she shows up?

28:30.308 --> 28:32.611
Xander, Giles, you guys
take the center of town.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.947
Willow, Tara, west side.
Spike, you and I
will get the east side.

28:36.281 --> 28:38.884
Just find her... please.

28:52.298 --> 28:54.365
I bet you can't push me
all the way around.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.836
-Oh, yes, I can!
-No, you can't.

29:08.780 --> 29:11.717
XANDER:
There's so many things
I remember.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.086
Seeing Dawn.
Hanging with her.

29:15.121 --> 29:19.758
Listening to Buffy
complain about her.
Mostly that last one.

29:19.791 --> 29:22.627
How could it be
that all those things
never really happened?

29:22.661 --> 29:23.895
Well, it takes some
getting used to,

29:23.930 --> 29:26.965
the idea of a bright
14-year-old...

29:26.999 --> 29:30.903
actually being
living energy
thousands of years old.

29:30.936 --> 29:34.673
I'm guessing some kind
of super-powerful
in her raw form.

29:34.705 --> 29:37.076
People have killed,
died for it,

29:37.108 --> 29:40.612
summoned armies
to control the key.

29:40.645 --> 29:45.183
You know, uh,
she kinda has a crush on me.

29:45.217 --> 29:48.287
Your point being?

29:48.319 --> 29:53.659
Well, nothing. No.
Just saying, powerful being,

29:53.692 --> 29:56.761
big energy gal
digging the Xan Man.

29:56.795 --> 29:59.631
Some guys are just cooler,
you know?

30:04.670 --> 30:07.038
Dawn?

30:07.073 --> 30:09.375
-Dawn!
-Yeah, that should do it.

30:09.407 --> 30:13.011
Shut up.
The nibblet scampered off
to get away from you.

30:13.045 --> 30:15.713
She hears you bellowing,
she's gonna pack it
in the opposite direction.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.682
Can't say I blame her.

30:19.750 --> 30:20.818
You were right.

30:22.820 --> 30:25.924
This is my fault.
I should have told her.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.330
She probably would
have skipped off anyway.

30:32.364 --> 30:34.799
Even if she never found out.

30:34.833 --> 30:39.538
She's not just a blob of energy.
She's also a 14-year-old
hormone bomb.

30:39.570 --> 30:41.507
Which one's screwing her up
more right now?

30:41.539 --> 30:44.175
Spin the bloody wheel.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.545
You'll find her
just in the nick of time.

30:46.577 --> 30:48.713
That's what
you hero types do.

30:52.584 --> 30:54.619
You'll find her.

30:57.588 --> 31:00.026
And then what?

31:00.058 --> 31:02.528
(sirens wailing)

31:36.827 --> 31:39.230
PATIENT #1
It's here. It's here.

31:39.265 --> 31:42.300
-It's here.
-PATIENT #2: Can't stop.

31:42.334 --> 31:45.938
It's here. It's here.
It's here.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.074
-It's here.
It's here.
-Make it stop.

31:48.106 --> 31:49.807
The skin's too tight.

31:51.943 --> 31:55.547
PATIENT #1
Can't hear it.
What's the frequency?

31:55.580 --> 31:57.583
Empty. All spilled out.

31:58.984 --> 32:02.688
Please...
You see me, right?

32:04.455 --> 32:07.925
-Look at me.
-PATIENT #2: Can't stop.

32:10.096 --> 32:14.566
You know what I am,
don't you?
You all know.

32:14.599 --> 32:16.934
Can't hear it. Can't hear it.
Can't hear it. Can't hear it.

32:16.969 --> 32:19.570
-Tell me!
-Can't hear it. Can't hear it.
Can't hear it. Can't hear it.

32:19.605 --> 32:21.472
-Can't hear it.
-What am I?

32:21.507 --> 32:23.342
The key.

32:26.011 --> 32:28.579
I found it.
Thank you.

32:28.614 --> 32:31.682
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.884
You know
what the key is?

32:35.186 --> 32:37.855
Where did I come from?

32:37.888 --> 32:40.425
Who made me?
What-- What am I?

32:40.459 --> 32:43.295
-Thank you. Thank you.
-Please.

32:43.328 --> 32:46.132
Destroyer!
Cracked earth and bones.

32:46.164 --> 32:48.034
The sun bleeding
into the sky.

32:48.067 --> 32:50.169
-No. No.
-The key is the link.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.503
-No, no...
-The link must be severed.
Such is the will of God.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.705
Such is the will of God.
Such is the will of God.

32:54.740 --> 32:57.175
-Such is the will of God.
-PATIENT#1
Can't hear it. Can't hear it.

32:57.209 --> 33:00.578
-Such is the will of God!
(laughing)
-Can't hear it. Can't hear it.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.951
Two steaming cups
of chocolate goodness,

33:06.984 --> 33:09.954
courtesy of whoever
I swiped it from
out of the cupboard.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.224
Couldn't find any marshmallows.
I'll try to steal some
for next time.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.626
-Don't like 'em anyway.
-What?

33:15.661 --> 33:19.498
Is that even
possible?
Too squishy.

33:19.530 --> 33:23.469
When I was five, Buffy told me
they were monkey brains and--

33:23.501 --> 33:25.804
Dawn, was your mom
brought back in?

33:25.836 --> 33:27.806
Is that why
you're here?

33:27.838 --> 33:31.376
No. My mom's just fine.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.080
Is there anybody I can call?
Your sister?

33:35.114 --> 33:38.549
-I don't have a sister.
-Oh.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.819
You two have a fight?
It's okay.
I know how that goes.

33:41.853 --> 33:45.423
I got a sister too.
They can be a real pain
sometimes, huh?

33:45.457 --> 33:48.594
I tell you, there have
been a lot of nights...

33:48.626 --> 33:51.230
I wish she didn't exist
either.

33:51.262 --> 33:54.700
It's not Buffy.
It's me.

33:54.732 --> 33:58.604
I'm the one
that doesn't exist.

33:58.636 --> 34:02.340
Look, I know it can feel
that way sometimes,
but when you're older--

34:02.374 --> 34:04.710
No, you don't understand.

34:04.742 --> 34:07.679
It's not real. None of this.
They made it.
Dawn--

34:07.712 --> 34:11.382
I'm nothing. I'm just
a thing the monks made
so Glory couldn't find me.

34:11.416 --> 34:15.954
-I'm not real.
-You're the key.

34:15.987 --> 34:18.123
How do you know
about the key?

34:18.157 --> 34:21.793
Go, before she finds you. Don't
ask me how she knows, 'cause
she always knows. Just go.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.396
-Wait! Calm down. Just tell me.
-You don't understand.
You're a kid.

34:24.429 --> 34:27.465
You stay, she'll find you.
She finds you, she'll hurt you.

34:27.498 --> 34:30.635
-What's wrong with you?
-You're what she's been
searching for.

34:30.668 --> 34:34.206
I am telling you, run!
You don't know! You--

34:34.239 --> 34:37.742
Oh, no. Oh, god, no.
She's coming.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.978
I can feel it.
You've got to get out.
No.

34:41.012 --> 34:43.081
-Oh, no! She's here!
-(screams)

34:43.114 --> 34:44.849
She's here.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.123
Hey, don't I know you?

34:58.197 --> 35:00.599
GLORY: Ugh! Cotton.

35:00.632 --> 35:04.936
Could a fabric be more
annoyingly pedestrian?

35:04.969 --> 35:08.106
Now this is what
I'm talking about.

35:08.139 --> 35:12.277
Ahh.
Makes your skin sing.

35:12.311 --> 35:15.981
You're... you're Ben.

35:16.014 --> 35:19.150
It's an eensy more
complicated than that.

35:19.184 --> 35:21.018
Family always is,
isn't it?

35:22.554 --> 35:24.456
You'd never make it.
I'd rip out your spine...

35:24.489 --> 35:26.757
Before you got
half a step.

35:26.791 --> 35:31.463
And those little legs,
they wouldn't be much good
without one of those.

35:31.496 --> 35:34.300
Would they, Dawnie?

35:34.333 --> 35:37.436
Now, what I'm trying
to noodle is...

35:37.469 --> 35:41.739
what in the world
was the Slayer's little sis
doing here with Gentle Ben?

35:43.242 --> 35:45.376
You don't remember?

35:45.411 --> 35:49.481
Remember what?
You were talking to him,
not me.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.452
Oh, he wasn't being naughty,
was he?

35:53.485 --> 35:56.153
-(door opens)
-Excuse me, ma'am.

35:56.188 --> 35:58.023
This area's for
hospital personnel--

35:58.056 --> 35:59.824
(gasps)

36:00.692 --> 36:03.494
Rude! I was talking.

36:05.231 --> 36:09.300
What do you say
we find a nice place
off the beaten...

36:09.335 --> 36:12.704
where you and I
can have a long,
uninterrupted chat?

36:15.740 --> 36:18.409
We've looked,
but no Dawn.
What about the carousel?

36:18.443 --> 36:20.746
-We checked there, too.
-Nothing?

36:20.778 --> 36:22.880
I'm sorry, Buff.

36:22.914 --> 36:24.615
Anything could have
happened to her.

36:25.916 --> 36:27.552
Not just Glory.

36:29.186 --> 36:32.824
We better check
the hospital.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.594
Okay. Small talk over.
I'm in a bit of a crunch here,

36:35.626 --> 36:37.829
so let's cut right
to the ooey, gooey center.

36:37.862 --> 36:40.065
Your sister, the Slayer,
has my key.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.367
It's mine. I want it.

36:42.400 --> 36:44.869
Do you know where
she squirreled it away?

36:44.902 --> 36:49.275
There's ice cream
and puppy dogs in it for you
if you start singin'.

36:49.307 --> 36:51.510
I'm not sure.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.778
What does it look like?

36:56.282 --> 37:01.119
Well, the last time
I caught a peep,

37:01.152 --> 37:05.056
it was a bright green
swirly shimmer.

37:06.557 --> 37:10.262
Really brought out
the blue in my eyes.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.898
But then those
sneaky little monks
pulled an abracadabra.

37:12.931 --> 37:15.266
So now it could look
like anything. You see
the predicament I'm in?

37:16.768 --> 37:18.135
Maybe.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.306
Yes?

37:23.409 --> 37:28.980
Well, maybe if you
told me more about it,

37:29.014 --> 37:32.016
I'd know
if I've seen it.

37:37.422 --> 37:41.259
(sniffs) Okay.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.762
BUFFY: She wasn't brought in.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.164
-Which is a happy thing, right?
-I don't know, I--

37:47.197 --> 37:49.335
I found him up on
the third floor
in the break room.

37:49.367 --> 37:51.969
You guys gotta see him.
His head's almost
twisted clean off.

37:54.639 --> 37:56.273
Glory.

37:56.307 --> 37:58.443
DAWN:
So this key thing,

37:58.476 --> 38:01.780
it's been around
for a long time?

38:01.813 --> 38:06.351
Well, not as long as me,
but, yeah.
Just this side of forever.

38:09.688 --> 38:12.056
-Is it evil?
-Totally.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.795
(laughs)
Well, no. Not really.

38:16.827 --> 38:19.030
I guess it depends
on your point of view.

38:21.166 --> 38:24.802
What's it for?
I mean...

38:24.835 --> 38:28.306
if it's a key,
there's gotta be
a lock, right?

38:28.340 --> 38:31.842
Yes.
We have a winner.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.713
So, so what does it open?

38:35.746 --> 38:37.849
(sighs)

38:40.351 --> 38:44.356
I smell a fox
in my hen house.

38:44.389 --> 38:46.724
Is that why you've been
playing sugar and spice
with Uncle Ben?

38:46.757 --> 38:49.394
-Trying to get a peek
at Glory's unmentionables?
-No, I--

38:49.427 --> 38:52.697
Shh.
I kinda wanna hear
me talking right now.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.967
Me talking.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.235
You know what
I'm startin' to think?

38:58.268 --> 39:00.972
I'm thinking...

39:01.005 --> 39:03.375
that maybe you...

39:04.842 --> 39:07.878
don't have any idea
where my key is.

39:08.713 --> 39:10.981
Very irritating.
Irrational.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.717
You know what I mean,
tiny snapdragon?
Like--

39:14.753 --> 39:17.722
Like bugs under my skin.

39:17.755 --> 39:21.427
And, say,
I'm feeling a little--

39:21.460 --> 39:26.030
-What's wrong with you?
-Hey.

39:26.063 --> 39:31.068
Hey. This doesn't have to be
a complete waste
of my precious time.

39:31.101 --> 39:33.905
I've been meaning to send
the Slayer a message.

39:35.239 --> 39:37.208
And I could use
a little pick-me-up.

39:37.242 --> 39:41.913
Two birds, one stone
and... Boom.

39:43.548 --> 39:45.516
You have yummy dead birds.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.184
(door opens)

39:47.217 --> 39:50.922
-Get away from my sister.
-Hey, we were just
talking about you.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.559
Conversation's over,
hell-bitch.

40:06.637 --> 40:08.806
I thought you said
this skank was tough.

40:22.653 --> 40:24.590
If he wakes up,
tell your boyfriend
to watch his mouth.

40:24.623 --> 40:27.458
He is not my boyfriend.

40:32.931 --> 40:35.601
Hey, those are really
nice shoes.

40:37.702 --> 40:38.869
Giles, now!

40:41.106 --> 40:42.940
Oh, please.
Like that's gonna--

40:42.974 --> 40:44.041
Hey!

40:46.210 --> 40:47.778
Watch the hair.

40:49.847 --> 40:52.851
-(screams)
-Time to start the dyin'.

40:52.884 --> 40:54.786
Start with the whelp.

40:55.385 --> 40:56.822
Dawn!

40:58.222 --> 40:59.490
-Buffy!
-Get back!

40:59.525 --> 41:00.958
GLORY: Nice catch.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.827
Is that the best
you little crap gnats
could muster?

41:02.860 --> 41:05.630
'Cause I gotta tell ya,
so not impressed.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.536
Look what you did
to my dress, you little--

41:14.505 --> 41:16.306
Willow.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.811
Dawn. Oh.

41:22.648 --> 41:24.349
What did you do to her?

41:24.382 --> 41:27.719
Teleportation spell.
Still working out the kinks.

41:27.753 --> 41:31.822
-Where'd you send her?
-Don't know.
That's one of the kinks.

41:36.827 --> 41:37.862
Oh, sh--

41:41.766 --> 41:46.070
That was an incredibly
dangerous spell
for an adept at your level.

41:46.103 --> 41:50.175
Yep. Won't be trying
that one again soon.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.311
BUFFY: Are you okay?
Did she hurt you?

41:53.344 --> 41:59.083
Why do you care?
Because I love you.
You're my sister.

41:59.117 --> 42:01.552
No, I'm not.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.190
Yes, you are.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.726
Look, it's blood.

42:08.760 --> 42:10.695
It's Summers blood.

42:17.034 --> 42:19.704
It's just like mine.

42:21.206 --> 42:23.942
Doesn't matter
where you came from...

42:23.974 --> 42:25.911
or, or how you got here.

42:25.943 --> 42:28.579
You are my sister.

42:30.949 --> 42:33.985
There's no way
you could annoy me so much
if you weren't.

42:43.094 --> 42:45.230
I was so scared.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.134
Me too.

42:52.570 --> 42:54.940
Come on.

42:58.175 --> 43:00.746
Wait. Ben.

43:00.778 --> 43:03.815
He was here.
He was trying to help me. He--

43:06.784 --> 43:08.987
I--

43:09.019 --> 43:11.623
I think he might have left
before Glory came.

43:12.923 --> 43:15.260
I can't,
I can't remember.

43:15.293 --> 43:17.762
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

43:17.795 --> 43:20.931
Next time we see him,
we'll thank him.

43:20.965 --> 43:24.202
I have to get you
back home, though.
Mom's freaking out.

43:25.704 --> 43:30.141
Oh. Is she mad about
the whole fire thing?

43:30.175 --> 43:32.177
I think you sort of have
a "Get Out Of Jail Free"
card...

43:32.210 --> 43:34.612
On account of
big love and trauma.

43:34.646 --> 43:37.282
Really? Okay.

43:37.315 --> 43:39.449
Good.

43:43.121 --> 43:47.291
You think she'd
raise my allowance?
Don't push it.

43:53.965 --> 43:55.900
(theme music playing)

44:24.494 --> 44:26.231
Grr! Arrgh!
