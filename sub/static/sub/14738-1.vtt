06:26.511 --> 06:28.053
Miss Carmichael, please.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.431
Dr. Petersen is ready for you.

06:30.599 --> 06:32.224
I'm awfully sorry. I have to go.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.852
Had a perfect hand.
Would've beaten the pants off you.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.104
- Harry will take you, Miss Carmichael.
- Thank you.

06:37.272 --> 06:40.274
Watch her carefully.
Don't take your eyes off her.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.867
- How are you today, Harry?
- Fine.

06:50.035 --> 06:52.745
- You look a little bilious.
- It's the light.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.872
I worry about you, dear.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.624
I'll be all right.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.084
Must we dash into Dr. Petersen's office?

06:59.252 --> 07:03.130
Can't we go sit somewhere in private
and talk, just you and I?

07:03.298 --> 07:05.215
Love it, if I had time.

07:05.759 --> 07:06.842
Would you?

07:16.269 --> 07:17.561
Come in.

07:22.275 --> 07:25.194
You ruined a very interesting card game,
Dr. Petersen.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.530
- You may go now, Harry.
- I'll be outside.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.576
I hope you feel better today, Mary.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.578
- Well, I don't.
- You will.

07:34.746 --> 07:36.705
I think this whole thing is ridiculous.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.207
What whole thing, Mary?

07:38.375 --> 07:41.377
Psychoanalysis. It bores the pants off of me.

07:42.379 --> 07:45.547
Lying on the couch
like some dreary nitwit, telling all.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.549
You don't really expect to get anywhere

07:47.717 --> 07:50.636
listening to me babble
about my idiotic childhood.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.804
Really.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.431
My patients invariably regard me
as a wretched nuisance

07:54.599 --> 07:55.933
during our first talks.

07:56.101 --> 07:59.812
I see. It's my subconscious
putting up a fight.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.939
It doesn't want me cured.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.984
Exactly. It wants to continue
enjoying your disease.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.820
Our job is to make you understand why.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.239
When you know why you're doing something
that's bad for you

08:10.407 --> 08:13.826
and when you first started doing it.
Then you can begin curing yourself.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.120
You mean I've been telling you lies?

08:16.287 --> 08:17.413
The usual proportion.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.749
You're right. I've been lying like mad.

08:21.626 --> 08:23.544
I hate men. I loathe them.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.295
If one of them so much as touches me,

08:25.463 --> 08:28.424
I want to sink my teeth into his hands
and bite it off.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.928
In fact, I did that once.
Do you care to hear about it?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.929
Tell me anything you remember.

08:35.097 --> 08:36.432
We were dancing.

08:36.599 --> 08:40.602
He kept asking me to marry him,
panting in my ear.

08:40.770 --> 08:43.355
I suddenly pretended
I was going to kiss him

08:43.523 --> 08:47.860
and sank my teeth into his mustache
and bit it clear off.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.656
You're laughing at me.

08:52.824 --> 08:55.659
That smug frozen face of yours
doesn't take me in.

08:55.827 --> 08:58.537
You just want me to tell you all this
so you can feel superior to me.

08:58.705 --> 09:02.291
You and your drooling science.
I detest you.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.336
I never want to see
that nasty face of yours again!

09:06.504 --> 09:07.796
I can't bear you.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.382
You and your nickel's worth of nothing!

09:14.554 --> 09:15.637
Come on, Miss Carmichael.

09:15.805 --> 09:18.474
Silly fool.
Letting a creature like that worry me.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.184
Miss Frozen Puss.

09:21.351 --> 09:24.980
Dr. Fleurot, I want to talk to you alone.

09:25.148 --> 09:27.399
I can't stand that woman.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.817
I'll see you later, Mary.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.819
Come, Miss Carmichael.

09:36.159 --> 09:39.244
Murchison must be really out of his mind
to assign Carmichael to you.

09:39.412 --> 09:43.165
You may report your findings
to the new head when he arrives.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.084
You can't treat a love veteran
like Carmichael

09:45.251 --> 09:47.086
without some inside information.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.505
I've done a great deal of research
on emotional problems

09:49.672 --> 09:53.008
- and love difficulties.
- Research, my eye.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.762
I've watched your work for six months.
It's brilliant but lifeless.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.514
There's no intuition in it.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.433
You approach all your problems
with an ice pack on your head.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.394
- Are you making love to me?
- I will in a moment.

10:04.562 --> 10:07.022
I'm just clearing the ground first.

10:07.190 --> 10:10.025
I'm trying to convince you
that your lack of human and emotional experience

10:10.193 --> 10:12.069
is bad for you as a doctor

10:13.196 --> 10:15.030
and fatal for you as a woman.

10:15.198 --> 10:18.200
I've heard that argument
from a number of amorous psychiatrists

10:18.368 --> 10:20.911
who all wanted to make
a better doctor of me.

10:21.079 --> 10:23.539
But I've got a much better argument.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.791
- I'm terribly fond of you.
- Why?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.631
It's rather like embracing a textbook.

10:32.799 --> 10:35.968
- Why do you do it then?
- Because you're not a textbook.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.388
You're a sweet, pulsing,
adorable woman underneath.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.223
I sense it every time
I come near to you.

10:41.391 --> 10:44.226
You sense only your own desires and pulsations.

10:44.394 --> 10:46.061
I assure you,
mine in no way resemble them.

10:46.229 --> 10:49.106
Stop it. I'm mad about you.

10:54.237 --> 10:56.071
I'm afraid I'm boring you.

10:56.239 --> 10:59.074
No. Your attitudes are very interesting.

11:00.326 --> 11:04.246
You're exactly like Miss Carmichael.
I'd like to throw a book at you.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.831
But I won't.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.041
- May I borrow this?
- Certainly.

11:08.209 --> 11:10.085
Oh, and forgive me for my criticism.

11:10.295 --> 11:13.630
I think you'd better stick to books.
And another thing...

11:13.798 --> 11:17.009
Pardon me for marching in,
but I'm spreading the tidings.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.844
My successor will be due any moment.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.763
Dr. Murchison, it's been a pleasure
working under you.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.015
Thank you very much.

11:23.183 --> 11:24.600
Coming, Dr. Petersen?

11:24.767 --> 11:27.436
I'm in no mad hurry to welcome Dr. Edwardes.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.608
It's hard to imagine this place without you,
Dr. Murchison.

11:32.775 --> 11:34.193
Yes, I sort of go with the fixtures.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.446
More than that. You are Green Manors.
It seems unfair.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.448
You're very young in the profession.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.992
You haven't learned
the basic secret of science.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.994
The old must make way for the new,

11:44.162 --> 11:46.872
particularly when the old is suspected
of a touch of senility.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.040
That's ridiculous.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.126
I should think the Board of Directors
would realize you're feeling much better.

11:51.294 --> 11:53.128
You've been like a new man
since your vacation.

11:53.296 --> 11:56.131
The Board's as fair and all-knowing
as a hospital board can be.

11:56.299 --> 11:59.134
I agree with you.
I'm as able and brilliant as ever.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.970
But having crumbled once,
I might crumble again.

12:02.138 --> 12:03.680
You were overworked.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.975
A charming diagnosis for a broken-down horse.

12:07.143 --> 12:09.519
I shall always remember
your cheerfulness today

12:09.687 --> 12:12.356
as a lesson in how to accept reality,
Dr. Murchison.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.234
Don't be too taken in
by my happy air, Constance.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.862
It's the least difficult way
of saying goodbye to 20 years.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.031
Yes, I know.

12:21.199 --> 12:22.199
Come in.

12:23.534 --> 12:27.496
- Your mail, Dr. Petersen and Mr. Garmes.
- Come in, Mr. Garmes.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.041
You're not leaving today?
I'll see you again?

12:31.209 --> 12:34.836
I shall hover around for a while
like an old mother hen.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.714
At least until Dr. Edwardes
is firmly on the list.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.055
How do you feel today, Mr. Garmes?

12:45.223 --> 12:48.642
Somewhat better, Doctor.
The thing seems a little less troublesome.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.523
May I do that for you, Doctor?

12:54.691 --> 12:57.776
Thank you, no.
I can do this myself very well.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.861
Please sit down.
I'll be with you in a moment.

13:16.879 --> 13:20.590
- So that's the mighty Anthony Edwardes.
- He looks a little younger than I expected.

13:20.758 --> 13:24.386
He's only brought one suitcase.
Perhaps he doesn't intend to remain very long.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.471
Leave those daydreams to Dr. Murchison.

13:31.311 --> 13:35.772
Gentlemen, our new chief,
Dr. Anthony Edwardes. Dr. Fleurot.

13:35.940 --> 13:36.982
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.235
- I am Dr. Graff.
- How do you do?

13:40.403 --> 13:41.820
- Dr. Hanish.
- How do you do?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.489
There's still some staff members missing,
Dr. Edwardes.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.742
These are your quarters.

13:48.745 --> 13:50.996
They're very festive for an institution.

13:52.915 --> 13:54.750
Dr. Edwardes, Dr. Murchison.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.127
How do you do, Dr. Murchison?
I've heard a great deal about you, sir.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.755
And I naturally about you.

13:59.922 --> 14:03.633
- You're younger than I thought you'd be.
- My age hasn't caught up with me yet.

14:03.801 --> 14:08.305
Mine has, it seems. I'm pleased to hand over
the reins to steadier hands.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.432
I'm leaving you my library which contains,

14:10.600 --> 14:11.850
amongst other items of interest,

14:12.018 --> 14:16.021
your latest volume, <i>The Labyrinth of the Guilt Complex.</i>
An excellent work.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.523
I hope Green Manors will inspire others as fine.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.525
I'm very grateful.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.987
I don't know the formal words
for an abdication, Dr. Edwardes.

14:24.155 --> 14:28.283
May I say, merely, that these quarters
which I've occupied for 20 years

14:28.451 --> 14:31.286
are now yours. Will you excuse me?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.713
I spent a half-hour with Dr. Edwardes.

14:41.881 --> 14:44.383
I must say, I was most favorably impressed.

14:44.550 --> 14:46.385
I intend to learn a great deal
from Dr. Edwardes.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.304
I think we all can,
from a man with such obvious talents.

14:49.472 --> 14:52.474
- You're familiar with his work?
- Yes, I've read all his books.

14:52.642 --> 14:54.976
A very keen, unorthodox mind.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.772
It would be dreadful
if Dr. Murchison's successor was unworthy of him.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.565
He's joining us.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.368
I think you know everyone here,
Dr. Edwardes.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.079
- No, not yet.
- Oh.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.581
- This is Dr. Petersen.
- How do you do?

15:18.167 --> 15:19.543
Dr. Edwardes.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.630
Dr. Hanish has been showing me the grounds.

15:23.840 --> 15:26.383
It's a remarkable institution,
Dr. Murchison.

15:26.551 --> 15:29.177
- Must be quite beautiful in the summer.
- I pointed out to Dr. Edwardes

15:29.345 --> 15:31.763
our various open-air diversions
for the patients.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.683
Dr. Murchison always argued
we did not do enough in that direction,

15:34.851 --> 15:35.892
and I agree with him.

15:36.060 --> 15:38.687
Let me warn you that Dr. Petersen
is a frustrated gymnast.

15:38.855 --> 15:42.065
Dr. Fleurot considers anything
beyond sitting and standing gymnastics.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.151
I imagine you're very fond of sports.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.070
Yes, I am, and I miss them,
particularly winter sports.

15:47.238 --> 15:48.947
Did you show Dr. Edwardes the elm grove?

15:49.115 --> 15:50.699
Yes, yes indeed.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.868
That's where we hope to have
our new swimming pool.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.494
I'm a great believer in the swimming pool.

15:54.704 --> 15:57.205
There's a perfect spot for it
among the elms.

15:57.373 --> 16:00.959
Not an oblong one,
but an irregular pool, something...

16:03.296 --> 16:06.298
Something like this, you know.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.634
Bathhouses should be here.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.390
I take it that the supply of linen
at this institution is inexhaustible!

16:21.981 --> 16:23.565
Forgive me.

16:24.650 --> 16:28.403
That reminds me of my professor in psychiatry,
Dr. Brulov.

16:28.571 --> 16:31.573
He could never stand a sauce bottle
on the table or even a salt shaker.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.742
They took his appetite away.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.537
I remember once at a banquet in his honor,

16:37.747 --> 16:39.664
he refused to sit at the speaker's table

16:39.832 --> 16:42.167
because he was completely surrounded by...

16:44.253 --> 16:45.837
by ketchup.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.262
Last night at dinner,

16:54.430 --> 16:57.307
a dimple appeared in your cheek
that was never there before.

16:57.475 --> 17:01.311
And I detected the outcroppings
of a mother instinct toward Dr. Edwardes.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.105
I detest that sort of high-school talk.

17:04.272 --> 17:07.108
Your reactions have upset
one of my pet theories about you.

17:07.276 --> 17:09.861
To wit, that you were immune to psychoanalysts

17:10.029 --> 17:13.823
and would end up in the arms
of some Boob McNutt with spiked hair.

17:13.991 --> 17:17.035
If I were looking for that type, Dr. Fleurot,
I would long ago have adored you.

17:20.957 --> 17:21.998
Come in.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.290
Hi.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.877
Excuse me, it's from Dr. Edwardes.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.300
Love notes already.
The French school of science.

17:36.639 --> 17:40.183
I didn't want to come to this institution,
but my brother insisted.

17:40.351 --> 17:42.561
I can see no sense in it myself.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.647
You see, I'm convinced I'm not suffering
from any hallucination

17:45.815 --> 17:47.816
but that my guilt is very real.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.152
I know, Dr. Edwardes,
that I killed my father.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.821
And I'm willing to pay the penalty for it.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.323
Come in.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.537
Thank you for coming so soon.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.206
I've been listening to Mr. Garmes
and thought you might help me out.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.709
Mr. Garmes, you shouldn't
have disturbed Dr. Edwardes.

18:05.876 --> 18:08.003
That's all right.
I'm very interested in Mr. Garmes' case.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.548
I knew you would be. He fits perfectly
into your chapters on the guilt complex.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.175
Would you mind telling me
what you're talking about?

18:14.343 --> 18:17.929
You're here to see if we can cure your guilt complex 
by psychoanalysis, Mr. Garmes.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.099
But I have no guilt complex.

18:21.267 --> 18:23.852
I know what I know.

18:24.020 --> 18:27.022
- I killed my father and I...
- No, you didn't kill your father.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.858
That's a misconception
that has taken hold of you.

18:30.776 --> 18:33.945
I'm sorry, Doctor.
You were talking to him.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.614
No, no, go on.

18:38.576 --> 18:40.869
People often feel guilty
over something they never did.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.871
It usually goes back to their childhood.

18:43.039 --> 18:46.249
The child often wishes something terrible
would happen to someone,

18:46.417 --> 18:48.460
and if something does happen
to that person,

18:48.628 --> 18:50.712
the child believes he's caused it.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.297
Then he grows up with a guilt complex

18:52.465 --> 18:55.467
over a sin that was
only a child's bad dream.

18:56.385 --> 18:58.136
What I am thinking isn't true, then?

18:58.304 --> 19:01.056
No. In the course of analyzing yourself,
you'll see that.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.893
Would you care to go back
to your room, Mr. Garmes?

19:09.899 --> 19:11.066
Harry.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.739
I think we'd better put him under drugs
for a few days.

19:17.907 --> 19:19.324
He looks agitated.

19:20.618 --> 19:22.327
His conviction is curious.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.829
But you've encountered such cases
very often, Dr. Edwardes.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.791
You described them perfectly in your book.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.169
Yes.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.962
Yes, so I did.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.842
- Would you mind doing me a favor?
- Not at all, Doctor.

19:38.010 --> 19:40.970
I've a headache. I'd like to take
the afternoon off. With you.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.973
I understand you're not on duty
till after dinner.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.601
- I intended typing out my notes.
- Please, I need a little fresh air

19:46.769 --> 19:48.144
and you look as though
it might do you a bit of good.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.521
I was going to lunch with Dr. Hanish.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.815
He has an interesting new patient, a kleptomaniac.

19:51.982 --> 19:54.776
Kleptomaniacs for lunch?
They'll steal the food right out of your mouth.

19:55.944 --> 19:57.112
Excuse me.

19:58.698 --> 20:02.200
Hello? Yes. Dr. Edwardes.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.452
What? Yes, Anthony Edwardes.

20:05.705 --> 20:06.705
Who?

20:08.207 --> 20:09.791
Sorry, I don't get your name.

20:10.793 --> 20:12.293
Norma Cramer?

20:15.214 --> 20:17.799
Please, Miss Cramer,
I'm very busy and I don't know you.

20:20.136 --> 20:21.970
Some girl claiming to be...

20:25.391 --> 20:27.517
I hate practical jokes, don't you?

20:27.685 --> 20:30.311
People calling you up and chirping,
"Guess who I am."

20:30.479 --> 20:32.313
Sounds like some ex-patient of yours.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.023
They're always full of coy little tricks.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.401
Very likely. Come on, let's go.

20:36.569 --> 20:40.363
We'll look at some sane trees, normal grass,
and clouds without complexes.

20:46.537 --> 20:48.329
I think the greatest harm done
to the human race

20:48.497 --> 20:50.749
has been done by the poets.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.918
Poets are dull boys, most of them,
but not especially fiendish.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.338
But they keep filling people's heads
with delusions about love,

20:57.506 --> 21:01.509
writing about it as if it were a
symphony orchestra, a flight of angels.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.554
- Which it isn't, eh?
- Of course not.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.055
People fall in love, as they put it,

21:06.223 --> 21:09.058
because they respond
to a certain hair coloring,

21:09.226 --> 21:12.437
or vocal tones or mannerisms
that remind them of their parents.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.397
Or sometimes, for no reason at all.

21:14.565 --> 21:17.609
But that's not the point. The point is
that people read about love as one thing

21:17.777 --> 21:19.611
and experience it as another.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.365
They expect kisses to be
like lyrical poems

21:24.533 --> 21:26.993
and embraces to be
like Shakespearean dramas.

21:28.287 --> 21:29.704
And when they find out differently,

21:29.872 --> 21:32.707
then they get sick
and they have to be analyzed, eh?

21:32.875 --> 21:34.292
Yes, very often.

21:34.460 --> 21:36.961
Professor, you're suffering
from mogo on the go-go.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.088
I beg your pardon.

21:40.925 --> 21:46.387
- You can't get through there like that.
- I can. I've done it many times.

21:47.223 --> 21:48.890
- You hurt?
- No, not at all.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.100
- Here.
- No, I'm perfectly all right.

21:53.103 --> 21:54.813
I've usually gone on picnics here alone.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.981
That doesn't sound like much fun.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.275
I haven't gone in for fun,
as you call it.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.236
Isn't this beautiful?

22:03.239 --> 22:04.405
Perfect.

22:06.158 --> 22:10.119
Oh, lunch. Lunch. What will you have?
Ham or liverwurst?

22:12.164 --> 22:13.414
Liverwurst.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.170
Has anybody seen our new chief today?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.130
He has been tied up.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.425
He frisked off with Dr. Petersen at noon.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.428
It's odd spending his first day
running after Dr. Petersen

22:27.596 --> 22:29.097
like a drooling college boy.

22:29.265 --> 22:31.266
It'll do Constance good
to be drooled over.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.309
Poor girl's withering away with science.

22:33.477 --> 22:34.853
I was telling her only recently

22:35.020 --> 22:37.105
that something vital
was missing from her life.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.822
Please don't get up.
I just came in because

22:45.990 --> 22:48.658
I learned Mr. Garmes
became agitated again this afternoon.

22:48.826 --> 22:51.661
- Yes, I gave him a sedative.
- I'm very sorry I wasn't here.

22:51.829 --> 22:54.455
Nonsense. You look as if
you had an instructive time.

22:54.623 --> 22:57.208
- Instructive?
- Gentlemen, notice her stocking.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.960
The lady's been climbing trees.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.045
Or lolling in a briar patch.

23:01.213 --> 23:04.007
No, it's trees.
There are two leaves in her hair.

23:04.174 --> 23:06.509
Allow me, Dr. Petersen.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.804
You're surpassing yourself
as a charmer, Dr. Fleurot.

23:09.972 --> 23:11.806
Don't run away. Do have some coffee.

23:11.974 --> 23:13.808
Dr. Petersen's already eaten,

23:13.976 --> 23:16.811
as one can tell by the mustard
on her right forefinger.

23:16.979 --> 23:19.731
I would say hot dogs
on the state highway.

23:19.899 --> 23:23.818
Would you really? Your diagnosis is,
as usual, wrong, Dr. Fleurot.

23:23.986 --> 23:25.820
Not hot dogs, liverwurst.

23:25.988 --> 23:29.657
I'm very sorry, I have to leave this nursery.
I must see Mr. Garmes.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.746
It looks as if we have Casanova himself
at the head of Green Manors.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.415
Did you notice her blush
every time we mentioned his name?

27:13.382 --> 27:14.715
It's very late.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.474
I was going to read your new book again.

27:23.642 --> 27:26.978
I would like to discuss it.
I have never discussed an author's work with him.

27:27.146 --> 27:29.647
Of course, at school,
we had several literary professors,

27:29.815 --> 27:31.274
but that was quite different.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.320
I sound rather nervous, don't I?

27:36.822 --> 27:37.905
Not at all.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.579
I thought I wanted to discuss
your book with you.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.747
I'm amazed at the subterfuge.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.752
I don't want to discuss it at all.

27:52.337 --> 27:53.671
I understand.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.969
It's quite remarkable to discover
that one isn't what one thought one was.

28:00.137 --> 28:03.472
I mean, I've always been entirely aware
of what was in my mind.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.266
And you're not now?

28:10.772 --> 28:12.773
It's quite ridiculous.

28:13.650 --> 28:16.944
It was stupid of me to come in here
like a distracted child.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.613
You're very lovely.

28:19.448 --> 28:22.491
Please don't talk that way.
You'll think I came in to hear that.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.954
I know why you came in.

28:28.832 --> 28:29.957
Why?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.710
Because something has happened to us.

28:33.879 --> 28:37.632
But it doesn't happen like that,
in a day.

28:37.799 --> 28:40.343
It happens in a moment sometimes.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.137
I felt it this afternoon.

28:44.056 --> 28:46.224
It was like lightning striking.

28:49.186 --> 28:50.353
It strikes rarely.

29:23.845 --> 29:26.389
I don't understand how it happened.

29:41.530 --> 29:43.531
- What is it?
- It's not you.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.033
Something about your robe.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.202
My robe? I don't understand.

29:50.414 --> 29:52.873
Forgive me. Something struck me.

29:54.209 --> 29:57.420
I've been having a rather bad time
with my nerves lately. Your robe...

29:57.587 --> 29:59.880
- I mean, the dark lines.
- You're ill.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.384
I'll be all right.

30:06.888 --> 30:09.557
Hello. Yes, Dr. Edwardes.

30:09.725 --> 30:13.227
Yes. Yes. What? Where is he?

30:13.395 --> 30:15.229
I'll be there right away.

30:15.397 --> 30:18.065
Mr. Garmes, he's run amuck.
Tried to murder Fleurot, then cut his own throat.

30:18.233 --> 30:20.443
- Is it bad?
- I think so. He's in surgery.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.153
I'll be right along.

30:28.952 --> 30:31.954
He's lost a lot of blood,
but I think he'll pull through.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.081
- What's the pulse?
- 140.

30:34.249 --> 30:35.958
It's going down.

30:58.774 --> 31:01.609
- Why are the lights out in the corridor?
- What do you mean?

31:02.194 --> 31:04.612
It's dark. That's why he did it.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.366
Because the lights are out.
Turn them on!

31:08.533 --> 31:10.951
Doors, unlock them!

31:11.119 --> 31:13.329
- You can't keep people in cells.
- Dr. Edwardes.

31:13.955 --> 31:17.041
Fools babbling about guilt complexes.
What do you know about them?

31:18.168 --> 31:19.168
He did it.

31:20.128 --> 31:22.797
He told me he killed his father.

31:25.300 --> 31:27.385
Put the lights on. Quick!

31:27.552 --> 31:30.054
It's dark. It's dark.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.306
- He's in collapse.
- He's ill.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.477
He didn't look like a heart case.

31:36.645 --> 31:39.772
Not heart, shock of some sort.
Must be brought about by exhaustion.

31:39.940 --> 31:41.649
Take him up to his room.
I'll take care of him.

32:46.381 --> 32:48.048
I'm sorry.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.387
I suppose I made quite an exhibition of myself.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.059
Who brought me down here? You?

33:04.399 --> 33:09.153
It's rather a mess.
Going to pieces in surgery.

33:11.573 --> 33:12.740
Who are you?

33:25.795 --> 33:27.296
I remember now.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.466
Edwardes is dead.

33:32.594 --> 33:35.346
I killed him and took his place.

33:36.765 --> 33:38.974
I'm someone else, I don't know who.

33:40.852 --> 33:43.521
I killed him. Edwardes.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.283
I have no memory.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.662
It's like looking into a mirror
and seeing nothing but the mirror.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.623
Yet the image is there.
I know it's there.

34:02.791 --> 34:04.291
I exist, I'm there.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.128
How can a man lose his memory,
his name, everything he's ever known,

34:08.295 --> 34:11.632
and still talk like this,
as if he were quite sane?

34:12.967 --> 34:16.971
- Are you afraid of me?
- No. You're ill.

34:17.138 --> 34:19.848
Loss of memory is not a difficult problem.

34:20.016 --> 34:21.809
Yes, I know, amnesia.

34:22.643 --> 34:25.312
A trick of the mind for remaining sane.

34:26.063 --> 34:29.400
You remain sane by forgetting
something too horrible to remember.

34:29.568 --> 34:31.652
You put the horrible thing
behind a closed door.

34:31.820 --> 34:33.070
We have to open that door.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.156
- I know what's behind that door. Murder.
- No!

34:36.324 --> 34:39.994
That's a delusion you have acquired
out of illness.

34:40.161 --> 34:42.204
Will you answer me truthfully
and trust me?

34:42.371 --> 34:46.417
I trust you, but it's no use.
I can't think. I don't know who I am.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.918
I don't know, I don't know.

34:49.337 --> 34:51.880
Who telephoned you yesterday?

34:52.047 --> 34:54.882
- Telephoned me?
- Yes. There in the office.

34:56.344 --> 34:57.845
Yes, I remember.

34:59.347 --> 35:00.889
What did she say?

35:02.017 --> 35:06.687
She said she was my office assistant.
She was worried about me, hadn't heard.

35:06.855 --> 35:09.732
You mean she was Dr. Edwardes' assistant
and hadn't heard from him.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.191
What else did she say?

35:11.359 --> 35:14.737
She didn't recognize my voice,
that I wasn't Dr. Edwardes.

35:14.904 --> 35:18.198
- You hung up in anger?
- I was confused.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.575
My head ached.

35:19.743 --> 35:21.952
- Was that your first doubt?
- First doubt?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.538
The first time you became confused as Edwardes?

35:25.582 --> 35:28.375
Did anything else happen before that?

35:29.544 --> 35:30.628
Yes.

35:31.880 --> 35:35.049
When I was in the hotel room
packing to come here

35:35.216 --> 35:37.801
I found a cigarette case in my coat.

35:37.969 --> 35:40.888
It frightened me.
I didn't know why it should.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.139
Here.

35:45.268 --> 35:47.895
The initials J.B. See them?

35:48.772 --> 35:51.273
When I saw them in the hotel room,

35:52.609 --> 35:54.610
they made my head ache.

35:57.614 --> 36:00.240
Well, they're probably your initials.

36:01.660 --> 36:05.079
J.B., J.B.

36:10.919 --> 36:14.963
You must sleep. I think... 
When you wake up, you'll be able to tell me more,

36:15.131 --> 36:17.800
- if you trust me.
- I trust you.

36:18.802 --> 36:22.304
It's late. You'd better get some sleep yourself.
I'll be all right.

36:27.936 --> 36:31.355
I'm sure there will be no police inquiry
for a few days.

36:31.523 --> 36:33.357
We'll talk about it
and straighten everything out

36:33.525 --> 36:35.025
before anything happens.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.366
I'll come in in the morning
and report you too ill for service.

37:31.249 --> 37:33.834
I have been in Dr. Edwardes' office
for five years,

37:34.002 --> 37:37.171
and the man who spoke to me
is not Dr. Edwardes.

37:37.338 --> 37:40.048
He let me have my vacation
when he left on his.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.594
I was very worried
when I didn't hear from him last week.

37:43.762 --> 37:47.681
Then I thought he might have just come here
without reopening his office.

37:47.849 --> 37:51.101
- That's why I telephoned.
- Show them the picture.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.269
Yes.

38:01.738 --> 38:04.364
- That's a different man.
- He was taking a chance.

38:04.532 --> 38:07.201
Somebody might have known
what Edwardes looked like.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.203
You never saw the real Edwardes?

38:09.370 --> 38:11.538
No, I never met him.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.958
But I felt something was wrong
from the moment our man appeared.

38:15.126 --> 38:18.045
He didn't impress me as a scientist.

38:18.213 --> 38:21.590
Last night when he collapsed,
I became actually alarmed.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.218
What do you think
made him break down last night?

38:24.385 --> 38:26.386
It's obvious now. Garmes.

38:27.263 --> 38:31.225
Our impostor, I'm almost certain,
is an amnesia case.

38:31.392 --> 38:34.102
Garmes brought him back to reality
for an instant.

38:34.270 --> 38:37.105
Being unable to face the truth
of who he was, he collapsed.

38:37.273 --> 38:40.317
- You think he may have killed Edwardes?
- There's no question of it.

38:40.485 --> 38:44.613
He killed Dr. Edwardes and took his place
in order to conceal his crime

38:44.781 --> 38:47.658
by pretending the victim
was still alive.

38:47.826 --> 38:51.745
This sort of unrealistic act
is typical of the shortsighted cunning

38:51.913 --> 38:54.456
that goes with paranoid behavior.

38:54.624 --> 38:57.626
We're wasting time, gentlemen.
His room is upstairs.

39:15.937 --> 39:18.313
Oh. Uh, this is Dr. Petersen.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.025
- These gentlemen are from the police.
- The police?

39:23.027 --> 39:25.946
- What has happened?
- Nothing to be alarmed about.

39:26.114 --> 39:28.782
Our Dr. Edwardes turns out
to be a paranoid impostor.

39:28.950 --> 39:31.869
He's very likely guilty
of having murdered the real Edwardes.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.370
He's disappeared.

39:34.998 --> 39:36.498
He is not in his room?

39:37.333 --> 39:39.793
- You left him in his room, miss?
- Yes.

39:39.961 --> 39:43.505
Did he say anything about himself,
about why he broke down?

39:43.673 --> 39:47.301
No. He was not himself.
He was unable to speak coherently.

39:47.468 --> 39:50.304
You don't seem very surprised to learn
that this Dr. Edwardes is a fake

39:50.471 --> 39:51.889
and may be guilty of murder.

39:53.141 --> 39:55.183
I'm used to such surprises in my work.

39:55.351 --> 39:57.227
You suspected something then?

39:58.354 --> 40:01.523
No. I thought his collapse
due to mental strain.

40:02.150 --> 40:03.817
That's a funny diagnosis for a fellow

40:03.985 --> 40:05.986
who's supposed to have
just come from vacation.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.362
I made no medical diagnosis.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.157
I was shocked to see him collapse
and didn't think beyond that.

40:10.325 --> 40:13.285
We were all pretty shocked, Sheriff.
The fellow took us all in.

40:13.494 --> 40:15.037
All except Dr. Murchison.

40:15.997 --> 40:18.999
And he didn't say anything
that might give you an idea of where he went?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.208
No.

40:21.669 --> 40:25.047
He may be hanging around.
We'll have to go over the grounds first.

40:32.388 --> 40:34.681
I'm sorry this has happened to you, Constance.

40:34.849 --> 40:37.976
I felt like warning you about him,
but I wasn't certain.

40:38.186 --> 40:41.229
Don't worry. It's not your fault.
They're bound to find him.

40:41.397 --> 40:43.732
I'll keep you informed
of the police activities.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.842
I say the fellow expected to get away with it
like any criminal.

41:11.052 --> 41:13.136
Nonsense. Obviously, a case of amnesia.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.390
He hadn't the faintest notion
of who he was or what he was doing.

41:16.557 --> 41:18.392
What do you say, Constance?

41:18.559 --> 41:20.727
I don't know.

41:20.895 --> 41:24.022
You know, if you were anybody
but Constance Petersen, the human glacier

41:24.190 --> 41:26.024
and the custodian of truth, I'd say...

41:26.192 --> 41:28.068
Yes, you'd say what?

41:28.236 --> 41:31.071
My dear, forgive me my scurvy thoughts.
You are telling the truth.

41:31.239 --> 41:34.116
I was going to say
that you were holding something back.

41:34.283 --> 41:35.909
I'm a sentimental ass.

41:36.077 --> 41:37.911
A woman like you
could never become involved emotionally

41:38.079 --> 41:40.288
with any man, sane or insane.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.290
I suggest you change the subject, Fleurot.

41:42.458 --> 41:45.168
I would be very interested
to ask him certain questions

41:45.336 --> 41:47.587
when they bring him back here.
No matter what you think.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.631
You'll never ask our mystery man
any questions.

41:49.799 --> 41:50.799
Why not?

41:50.967 --> 41:53.677
For the very good reason,
the police will never find him alive.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.013
Amnesia case of that sort
with the police after him,

41:56.180 --> 41:57.806
it's an obvious suicide.

41:57.974 --> 42:00.183
The fellow'll put an end
to his pain and nightmare fantasies

42:00.351 --> 42:03.687
either by blowing his brains out
or dropping himself out of a window.

42:04.230 --> 42:07.357
You're offending Dr. Petersen
with your callousness.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.944
I'm sorry, Constance, that our staff
retains the manners of medical students.

42:12.405 --> 42:14.114
I'm not offended.

42:14.282 --> 42:18.160
I think Dr. Fleurot's ideas are quite accurate,
but I'm rather tired. Good night.

42:18.327 --> 42:19.327
Good night.

42:20.997 --> 42:22.622
<i>The police have asked me to announce</i>

42:22.790 --> 42:23.999
<i>that our neighborhood roads</i>

42:24.167 --> 42:28.003
<i>are free of the dangerous madman
who escaped from Green Manors.</i>

42:28.171 --> 42:30.964
<i>The search for the impostor
has shifted to Manhattan.</i>

42:31.132 --> 42:34.885
<i>This is WQZK Brooklyn, George Bell.</i>

42:35.053 --> 42:38.138
<i>We now resume our regularly scheduled program.</i>

43:34.862 --> 43:38.115
Sure feels good
to take the weight off your feet.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.039
I'm from Pittsburgh.

43:46.207 --> 43:48.708
There's a town for you.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.545
Really can meet people in Pittsburgh.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.214
Friendly.

43:54.382 --> 43:58.593
Fellow could live and die in this town,
and he couldn't meet nobody.

44:01.264 --> 44:03.890
How about you and me
having a nice little drink together

44:04.058 --> 44:05.809
now that we're acquainted?

44:05.977 --> 44:07.978
No, thank you.

44:08.146 --> 44:11.106
You don't have to be so snooty about it.

44:11.274 --> 44:16.570
I'll have you know, madam,
that I know better people than you in Pittsburgh.

44:16.737 --> 44:20.240
Yeah, I'm sure you're a great social success,
given half a chance.

44:20.408 --> 44:22.909
Now you're talking.

44:23.077 --> 44:25.495
Do you mind not sitting in my lap in public?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.581
That's enough of that.

44:28.749 --> 44:29.749
Beat it.

44:30.084 --> 44:34.087
I'll have you know, I'm a guest in this hotel.
Who do you think you are?

44:34.255 --> 44:37.090
I'm the house detective. Get going.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.761
This town's getting worse and worse.

44:43.639 --> 44:46.433
That's all right, lady,
you don't have to go.

44:46.601 --> 44:49.436
I'm sorry you were being annoyed.
I've been watching you for some time,

44:49.604 --> 44:51.688
and I figured something like this
might happen.

44:51.856 --> 44:56.443
The chief duty of a house detective
is to spot trouble in advance.

44:56.611 --> 44:59.279
- You're not registered here, are you?
- No.

44:59.447 --> 45:01.948
I didn't think so,
the way you were wandering around.

45:02.825 --> 45:04.367
Looking for somebody?

45:04.535 --> 45:06.286
Don't be afraid of me.

45:06.454 --> 45:11.458
I've got you spotted as a lady in trouble
and from out of town.

45:12.460 --> 45:17.047
Schoolteacher or librarian, which is it?

45:17.215 --> 45:19.174
- Schoolteacher.
- I thought so.

45:19.342 --> 45:22.010
They always look like
they just lost something.

45:22.178 --> 45:25.013
- Maybe I can help you.
- I don't think so, thank you.

45:25.181 --> 45:28.558
Looking for some man, I suppose.
Must be a relative.

45:30.311 --> 45:33.021
And from the worried look,
I'd say a pretty close one.

45:33.189 --> 45:35.023
A husband, for instance.

45:35.900 --> 45:39.152
- I'm really amazed.
- I hit it, huh?

45:39.320 --> 45:40.403
But how could you tell?

45:40.571 --> 45:44.324
I'm a kind of a psychologist.
You know, you got to be in my line.

45:46.327 --> 45:49.579
Now, would you mind filling in
a few of the blank spaces for me?

45:50.539 --> 45:53.833
No. It's just that we quarreled.

45:54.001 --> 45:59.422
And then you got sorry and came running after him.
That's the usual psychology.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.591
But now you're afraid to face him.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.176
No, no.

46:04.262 --> 46:07.180
It's that I don't know
what room he's in.

46:07.348 --> 46:10.183
He told a friend he was coming to this hotel
but under a different name

46:10.351 --> 46:11.851
so I couldn't find him.

46:12.019 --> 46:15.689
But I must find him and apologize
and make him feel better.

46:16.274 --> 46:18.191
When did he arrive here?

46:19.694 --> 46:21.194
Yesterday morning.

46:21.362 --> 46:23.071
Give me a description of him.

46:24.532 --> 46:27.284
He's very tall and attractive.

46:29.036 --> 46:31.955
Dark hair, a rather rugged face

46:33.040 --> 46:35.292
and brown eyes and one suitcase.

46:35.459 --> 46:37.043
I'll go check on him.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.081
Did you find him?

47:15.249 --> 47:16.416
Well, I think we got a line.

47:16.584 --> 47:19.753
About 25 guys answering your description
registered here yesterday.

47:19.920 --> 47:23.840
These are their registration cards.
You might recognize the handwriting.

47:24.008 --> 47:26.092
That's very clever of you.

47:35.436 --> 47:38.271
- This is his handwriting.
- John Brown, huh?

47:38.439 --> 47:41.941
Not much imagination for an alias.
Room 3033.

47:42.109 --> 47:44.694
Thank you very much. I was going
to sit here all day watching for him.

47:44.862 --> 47:47.947
I know you would. I'm glad to be of service.
I'm a married man myself

47:48.115 --> 47:51.951
and I know how it feels to have a wife
come chasing after you to apologize.

48:05.132 --> 48:06.174
Constance.

48:08.135 --> 48:11.304
What did you come for?
You don't owe me anything.

48:11.639 --> 48:14.182
I'm going to do what I want to do.

48:14.350 --> 48:17.477
Take care of you, cure you,
and remain with you till that happens.

48:17.645 --> 48:19.646
But you can't,
you can't help hide a criminal.

48:19.814 --> 48:22.148
You're not going to jeopardize
your standing as a doctor.

48:22.316 --> 48:25.527
You're just getting started.
I won't let you be stupid about it.

48:25.694 --> 48:28.029
I couldn't bear it away from you.

48:28.197 --> 48:31.157
I went through yesterday holding my breath
as if I were being hunted.

48:31.325 --> 48:35.036
I couldn't eat or work or do anything
but think of you.

48:35.204 --> 48:36.746
So I had to come.

48:37.748 --> 48:41.418
I'll get a room on this floor.
I'm here as your doctor only.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.921
It has nothing to do with love.

48:49.844 --> 48:51.219
Nothing at all.

48:52.096 --> 48:53.555
Nothing at all.

48:56.225 --> 48:58.059
Try remembering.

48:58.227 --> 49:02.105
Let your mind go back to your childhood.
Was it happy?

49:02.273 --> 49:04.691
Whom did you know in your childhood?

49:06.110 --> 49:07.527
I'm haunted, but I...

49:08.737 --> 49:11.114
I can't see by what.

49:12.450 --> 49:14.868
- It's no use.
- You lived somewhere.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.871
You had a mother, you were loved,
you had friends.

49:18.038 --> 49:21.040
Yes. Probably a wife.

49:23.961 --> 49:25.253
Can you remember her?

49:26.881 --> 49:29.382
I didn't say I had one.

49:29.550 --> 49:31.259
I said I probably had.

49:33.262 --> 49:37.307
No, darling. Thank heaven,
I can't remember a wife.

49:37.933 --> 49:39.767
I would like to ask you
a medical question.

49:39.935 --> 49:44.439
Constance, would you mind not prodding me?
It mixes me up.

49:46.442 --> 49:49.068
I can't remember anything.

49:49.236 --> 49:50.236
Except that I love you.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.906
How would you diagnose a pain
in the right upper quadrant?

49:53.073 --> 49:54.657
A pain that is persistent?

49:56.243 --> 49:59.078
Gall bladder, possibly a heart case,
or pneumonia,

49:59.246 --> 50:01.331
depending on the patient's history.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.082
It's obvious you're a doctor.

50:03.459 --> 50:07.420
Yes. The eminent Dr. X.

50:07.588 --> 50:11.966
And if we can unlock one tiny memory,
it will give us a key to the others.

50:12.134 --> 50:13.176
No.

50:15.429 --> 50:18.765
The only thing that comes to my mind
that I keep thinking over and over,

50:18.933 --> 50:21.100
- is the logic of the situation.
- What logic?

50:21.268 --> 50:23.686
That it was I who was with Edwardes.

50:26.815 --> 50:30.777
"Police believe the impostor
who escaped from Green Manors

50:30.945 --> 50:33.404
"to be the patient who visited
the real Dr. Edwardes

50:33.614 --> 50:38.201
"in the Cumberland Mountains
the day that the noted psychiatrist disappeared.

50:38.369 --> 50:41.704
"No trace of Dr. Edwardes has been found
since he left the Cumberland Resort

50:41.872 --> 50:44.290
"in the company of his supposed patient."

50:44.458 --> 50:45.959
- Do you remember that?
- No.

50:46.126 --> 50:48.962
Why do you believe then
that you were with him?

50:49.129 --> 50:52.382
Because wherever we went,
I came back with his identity.

50:52.550 --> 50:53.967
I wouldn't have come back as Dr. Edwardes

50:54.134 --> 50:56.344
if I hadn't known that he was dead.

50:56.512 --> 50:59.055
How would I know that he was dead
if I hadn't been with him when he died?

50:59.223 --> 51:00.640
Were you?

51:00.808 --> 51:02.475
I don't remember,

51:03.727 --> 51:06.854
but, logically, I know that I must have been.

51:08.691 --> 51:12.360
Logically, I also know
why the body hasn't been found.

51:13.487 --> 51:16.406
Because it was hidden by me.

51:17.324 --> 51:19.534
Don't you see
that you are imagining all this?

51:19.702 --> 51:23.871
You call yourself names.
You insist without proof that you're a murderer.

51:24.873 --> 51:26.374
You know what that is, don't you?

51:26.542 --> 51:29.419
Whoever you are,
it's a guilt complex that speaks for you.

51:29.587 --> 51:32.547
A guilt fantasy that goes way back
to your childhood.

51:33.841 --> 51:37.510
I think you're quite mad.
You're much crazier than I

51:37.678 --> 51:40.430
to do all this
for a creature without a name,

51:40.598 --> 51:43.266
to run off with a pair of initials.

51:48.188 --> 51:52.692
The police have not given your name
or case history to the papers.

51:52.860 --> 51:57.238
That must mean one thing.
That your name was not in Dr. Edwardes' files.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.199
You were in an accident.

52:01.702 --> 52:03.369
Where was it?

52:03.537 --> 52:06.539
What happened to your hand?
Your hand was burned.

52:07.458 --> 52:10.585
You've had an operation
in the last six months.

52:10.753 --> 52:13.630
A skin graft. Third degree burns.

52:13.797 --> 52:16.549
Your hand was burned. Where?

52:16.717 --> 52:18.760
- It hurts.
- Try remembering.

52:21.764 --> 52:22.889
My hand hurts.

52:23.057 --> 52:26.100
Your hand is remembering.
Open your mind and the pain will leave.

52:26.268 --> 52:28.102
- Where did it happen?
- I can't. It hurts.

52:28.270 --> 52:29.979
- What happened?
- It's burning. My hand's burning.

52:30.147 --> 52:31.898
Try to remember.

52:42.076 --> 52:46.579
- My dear, are you all right?
- I'm all right. What happened?

52:46.747 --> 52:49.082
You relived an accident you've been in.

52:49.249 --> 52:52.335
But the memory only touched
the part of your mind that feels.

52:52.503 --> 52:55.171
But it's a beginning. It really is.

52:55.339 --> 52:56.589
You'll feel better soon.

52:59.009 --> 53:00.259
Who could that be?

53:00.427 --> 53:04.263
I know. I sent down
for the later editions of the papers.

53:08.268 --> 53:09.769
- You ordered the afternoon papers?
- Yes.

53:09.937 --> 53:12.146
- They came. I brought them right up.
- Just a minute.

53:19.488 --> 53:21.989
- Here you are. Thank you.
- Thanks.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.120
My picture's in the paper.
He recognized me.

53:27.287 --> 53:28.871
We've got to go. Quick.
We can't pack.

54:07.161 --> 54:11.497
Listen, when you left the mountains,
you must have passed through New York.

54:11.665 --> 54:12.999
Wherever you came from,
wherever you went,

54:13.167 --> 54:14.542
you must've been in a railroad station.

54:14.710 --> 54:17.712
You must have heard Edwardes
ask for tickets to somewhere.

54:19.214 --> 54:21.674
- I don't remember.
- You will.

54:21.842 --> 54:25.511
When you come to the ticket window,
try to relive that other time with Edwardes.

54:25.679 --> 54:29.849
Try to repeat what was said then.
Ask for the same tickets.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.185
I'll try.

54:42.362 --> 54:43.780
One, Philadelphia.

54:50.120 --> 54:54.874
Philadelphia. $3.39, including the total
with tax. Thank you.

55:01.131 --> 55:04.884
You went someplace with Edwardes.
Ask for tickets to that same place.

55:05.052 --> 55:08.095
$8.46, including tax. Thank you.

55:13.393 --> 55:14.560
What is it?

55:16.563 --> 55:18.314
What do you want, sir?

55:23.403 --> 55:24.654
Can you please step aside?

55:25.906 --> 55:27.573
I want two tickets.

55:28.242 --> 55:29.575
Where to?

55:33.956 --> 55:34.956
Rome.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.000
- Rome.
- To where?

55:39.002 --> 55:41.420
- Rome.
- What Rome?

55:44.174 --> 55:46.008
He means Rome, Georgia.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.436
Is there anything wrong?

55:57.604 --> 56:00.356
My husband is ill. I'm taking him home.

56:00.524 --> 56:02.608
Here you are.
Two tickets to Rome, Georgia.

56:02.776 --> 56:05.444
He'll be all right in a minute.
These dizzy spells go away quickly.

56:05.612 --> 56:08.781
- He looks sick. I'll call a doctor.
- No, no, he'll be all right.

56:08.949 --> 56:10.616
Do you feel better now, darling?
Darling?

56:10.784 --> 56:13.452
Pull yourself together.
You're all right.

56:13.620 --> 56:15.037
When does the train for Rome leave?

56:15.205 --> 56:18.291
Birmingham Special.
Leaves in 10 minutes. Track 17.

56:19.543 --> 56:21.460
- I feel better now.
- Thank you.

56:21.628 --> 56:24.005
That's all right, I'll take him to the train
in case anything happens.

56:24.172 --> 56:25.506
He has recovered now.

56:25.674 --> 56:28.384
You're very nice to offer help,
but I can get along. Thank you.

56:50.991 --> 56:53.868
Act as if we are taking this train.
We walk down-aways and then turn back.

56:54.036 --> 56:56.537
- What's the matter with this train?
- The policeman heard us buy the tickets.

56:56.705 --> 56:58.164
- Did he act suspicious?
- No, he was very nice.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.749
But when he goes
to the police station tonight,

56:59.917 --> 57:02.376
he may find descriptions of us posted
and he'll remember us.

57:02.544 --> 57:04.670
They'll telegraph Rome, Georgia,
and have us picked up.

57:04.838 --> 57:07.548
We can't go back to the hotel.
They'll have a million police there by now.

57:07.716 --> 57:09.926
We're not going back.
We're going to Rochester.

57:10.093 --> 57:12.178
Come on, we'll go over
to the Grand Central Station.

57:18.060 --> 57:19.977
By the way, what are we going
to Rochester for?

57:20.187 --> 57:21.938
We're going to visit Dr. Brulov.

57:22.105 --> 57:23.689
That's the fellow who doesn't like
sauce bottles.

57:23.857 --> 57:26.025
He was my analyst.
He psychoanalyzed me.

57:26.193 --> 57:27.777
Really? What was wrong with you?

57:27.945 --> 57:30.237
All analysts have to be psychoanalyzed
by other analysts

57:30.405 --> 57:32.073
before they start practicing.

57:32.240 --> 57:34.742
That's to make sure
that they're not too crazy.

57:34.910 --> 57:37.870
Apparently, the mind is never too ill
to make jokes about psychoanalysis.

57:38.038 --> 57:39.747
I'm sorry. I'm a pig.

57:39.915 --> 57:41.707
I am. I keep forgetting you're a patient.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.042
So do I.

57:43.210 --> 57:45.544
When I hold you like this,
I feel entirely well.

57:45.712 --> 57:48.047
Will you love me just as much
when I'm normal?

57:48.215 --> 57:50.716
I'll be insane about you.

57:50.884 --> 57:52.593
I am normal.

57:55.097 --> 57:59.058
At least, there's nothing wrong with me
that a nice, long kiss wouldn't cure.

57:59.226 --> 58:02.061
I've never treated a guilt complex
that way before.

58:09.569 --> 58:12.571
- We don't want to attract attention.
- Everybody's doing it.

58:17.244 --> 58:19.453
- You both going?
- Yes.

58:28.463 --> 58:31.257
Don't read the paper.
Let's pick up where we left off.

58:31.425 --> 58:32.425
Pick up what?

58:32.592 --> 58:36.429
Try to recall the first moment you thought
you were Edwardes.

58:36.596 --> 58:39.807
- Darling, I have a confession to make.
- Yes, I'm listening.

58:39.975 --> 58:42.852
As a doctor, you irritate me.

58:43.020 --> 58:45.938
I sit here swooning with love,
and then suddenly you ask me a question

58:46.106 --> 58:47.273
and I don't like you anymore.

58:47.441 --> 58:48.941
Do you have to sit there smiling at me

58:49.109 --> 58:51.110
like some smug know-it-all schoolteacher?

58:51.278 --> 58:53.779
I can't help smiling.
That's what happens in analysis.

58:53.947 --> 58:56.657
As the doctor begins to uncover the truth
for the patient,

58:56.825 --> 59:01.370
said patient develops a fine,
hearty hatred of said doctor.

59:01.538 --> 59:04.665
You're going to hate me a great deal
before we're through.

59:04.833 --> 59:07.460
- And you're gonna like that.
- As a scientist, yes.

59:07.627 --> 59:11.756
And if I shall happen to biff you one,
you'll consider that sort of a diploma.

59:11.923 --> 59:13.507
Yes, but don't biff too hard.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.968
No, I think we should go on
with our investigation.

59:16.136 --> 59:18.304
We have some new facts
to work with now.

59:18.472 --> 59:20.806
- What facts?
- You're a doctor,

59:20.974 --> 59:24.185
you were in an accident,
your hand and forearm were burned,

59:24.352 --> 59:27.146
- and you were in Rome.
- I was never in Rome in my life.

59:27.314 --> 59:29.482
You were either there or going there.

59:29.649 --> 59:32.860
You remembered something, no doubt
connected with the burning of your hand.

59:34.237 --> 59:37.198
Rome. Think of Rome.

59:37.365 --> 59:39.200
Maybe Rome, Italy.

59:39.367 --> 59:41.494
When did you go to Rome?

59:41.995 --> 59:43.704
What did you do in Rome?

59:45.165 --> 59:46.373
Think.

59:56.676 --> 59:57.676
Rome.

01:00:01.848 --> 01:00:04.100
Yes. I remember something.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:06.685
- Fighter planes spotted us.
- You were flying?

01:00:06.853 --> 01:00:09.438
Transport, Medical Corps.
Over Rome, heading north.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.398
- What happened?
- They hit us.

01:00:11.566 --> 01:00:13.692
Caught fire. Uniform burned.
Bailed out.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:15.027
What else?

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.365
I don't know. It blacks out.

01:00:20.033 --> 01:00:21.200
You left the Army?

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:23.077
Yeah.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.705
I probably deserted. I hated it.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.583
I hated killing.
I can remember that much.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:32.795
Your guilt fantasies were obviously inflamed
by your duties as a soldier.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.798
Stop it.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:38.300
Babbling like some phony King Solomon!

01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:41.470
Sit there full of half-witted devil talk
that doesn't make sense!

01:00:41.638 --> 01:00:43.973
If there's anything I hate,
it's a smug woman!

01:00:47.978 --> 01:00:52.606
Darling, we're just beginning.
Don't biff too hard yet.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:06.620
I worked as Dr. Brulov's assistant for a year,
right after my internship.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:09.748
He got me the post at Green Manors.
You'll like Alex.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:13.586
I doubt that.
One psychoanalyst in my hair's enough.

01:01:13.753 --> 01:01:17.464
- What are you gonna tell him?
- That we are on our honeymoon.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:21.510
Doctor, you think of
the most wonderful prescriptions.

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:25.598
- Good evening. Is Dr. Brulov in?
- No, he went out right after dinner.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:26.807
He ought to be back soon.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:31.395
Would you mind telling him
I've left his supper on the table?

01:01:31.563 --> 01:01:33.939
I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.442
There are two gentlemen
waiting for him in there.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.993
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:02:02.177 --> 01:02:04.428
How's your mother been lately?

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:07.473
She's still complaining about rheumatism.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:10.726
She figures I ought to get transferred
down to Florida.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:14.021
I said, "Do you expect me
to sacrifice all chance of promotion

01:02:14.189 --> 01:02:15.731
"just because you've got rheumatism?"

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.568
Did you take the subject up with Hennessy?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.655
Yeah. He said a transfer could be arranged,

01:02:22.822 --> 01:02:25.157
but I'd probably have to start
all over again as a sergeant.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.409
I said, "Personally, I think that's unfair.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:30.079
"After all the work I did
on that narcotics case."

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:32.206
What did Hennessy say to that?

01:02:32.374 --> 01:02:36.543
A lot of things. He made some crack
about me being a mama's boy.

01:02:44.678 --> 01:02:48.264
Pardon me. That may be for me.
I gave headquarters this number.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:50.432
Hello.

01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:53.852
Yes. This is Lieutenant Cooley.
Any new developments?

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:57.106
When did you find that out?

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.902
No. Right. I'll be down later. Goodbye.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:21.880
Alex.

01:03:22.048 --> 01:03:23.882
Who is it, please?

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:25.259
My old friend!

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.553
- Alex.
- My dear darling.

01:03:28.263 --> 01:03:30.431
I didn't have time to let you know.
I just arrived.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:35.102
Imagine I find you here.
I would have come home quicker.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:37.771
I was giving a lecture at the Army Hospital.

01:03:37.939 --> 01:03:40.441
- Are these gentlemen with you?
- No. I'm here with...

01:03:40.608 --> 01:03:43.110
Dr. Brulov, I'm Lieutenant Cooley
of Central Station.

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.322
- This is Sergeant Gillespie.
- What for?

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:49.033
We thought you might give us
some data on Dr. Edwardes.

01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:50.242
Data?

01:03:51.619 --> 01:03:54.163
What is this kind of persecution?

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:58.459
I told the policeman yesterday
I know nothing about Edwardes.

01:03:58.626 --> 01:04:01.587
But yesterday, you had some kind of theory.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.422
I explained to the policeman

01:04:03.590 --> 01:04:06.508
that if Edwardes took along with him
on a vacation

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:08.344
a paranoid patient,

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:12.014
he was a bigger fool
than I ever knew he was.

01:04:12.182 --> 01:04:14.808
It is the same as playing with a loaded gun.

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:17.019
Do you think this patient
might have killed him?

01:04:17.187 --> 01:04:19.646
I'm not thinking anything.
I'm not a bloodhound.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.607
Was Dr. Edwardes a great friend of yours?

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:24.902
What are you talking about?
The man was impossible.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:28.030
You had a quarrel with him
when you were back in New York, I understand.

01:04:28.198 --> 01:04:31.617
Not New York.
In Boston at the psychiatry convention.

01:04:31.785 --> 01:04:35.662
What kind of an analyst is it
who wants to cure psychosis

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:39.124
by taking people skating
or to a bowling alley?

01:04:39.292 --> 01:04:41.960
I understand you threatened
to punch his nose.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:44.838
All I did was get up and walk out,

01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.800
and kick over a few chairs
which nobody was sitting in.

01:04:47.967 --> 01:04:49.968
So you don't have to ask me
any more questions.

01:04:50.136 --> 01:04:51.470
You have now the facts.

01:04:51.638 --> 01:04:55.182
Well, thank you very much.
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.645
If anything turns up,
we'll let you know. Goodbye, ma'am.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:01.647
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

01:05:09.489 --> 01:05:12.825
What do you suppose
they are snooping around me for?

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:15.661
Next they will give me the third degree.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:18.038
Alex, I'm so glad to see you.
I was going to write to you

01:05:18.206 --> 01:05:20.749
but it happened so suddenly.
I got married.

01:05:21.835 --> 01:05:22.918
Who is married?

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:26.004
Why, Alex, my husband, John Brown.

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:29.758
- I'm glad to meet you officially.
- So you are married.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:33.387
There is nothing so nice
as a new marriage.

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:37.349
No psychoses yet, no aggressions,
no guilt complexes.

01:05:38.351 --> 01:05:39.768
I congratulate you

01:05:39.936 --> 01:05:43.772
and wish you have babies
and not phobias.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:48.402
How about we have a glass of beer
like in the old days?

01:05:48.570 --> 01:05:51.905
The truth is that we have no hotel room.
All the hotels were so crowded.

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.615
What do you want with a hotel?

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:57.369
That's for millionaires,
not for lovebirds on a honeymoon.

01:05:57.537 --> 01:05:59.872
You will stay right here.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:03.667
Look how I'm living by myself
with a can opener.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:08.130
My housekeeper has gone to war,
my secretary is a WAC.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:12.259
And I've got a cleaning woman
who can't cook and who hates me.

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:15.721
Cook me my coffee in the morning,
and the house is yours.

01:06:15.889 --> 01:06:19.725
- That's wonderful of you, Alex.
- There's nothing wonderful about me.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:22.436
It's nice to see my old assistant.

01:06:22.604 --> 01:06:25.606
The youngest, but the best one I ever had.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:28.775
But who knows now.

01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:32.237
As my old friend Zannenbaum used to say,

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:36.408
"Women make the best psychoanalysts,

01:06:36.576 --> 01:06:38.494
"till they fall in love.

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:42.247
"After that, they make the best patients."

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.086
Good night and happy dreams,

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.422
which we will analyze at breakfast.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:53.342
Good night, Dr. Brulov.
Thanks for everything.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.845
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine, so to speak.

01:06:57.013 --> 01:06:58.764
- Good night, Alex.
- Good night.

01:07:14.155 --> 01:07:17.324
- You were superb with the police.
- Was I?

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.368
Carried it off like a grade-A gun monger.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:23.121
I felt terribly stupid for a few minutes
but it turned out very well.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.457
Providing the professor
isn't wiser than he seems.

01:07:25.625 --> 01:07:27.292
Alex? No.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:30.003
Things are different here.
Someone's been here since my time.

01:07:30.171 --> 01:07:32.214
Alex didn't think anything.
He's sweet.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:36.343
He may be sweet, but he didn't
even ask us where our bags were.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:40.472
Alex is always like that,
in a complete dream state socially.

01:07:46.813 --> 01:07:49.648
Do you know, this room
does look changed,

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:51.316
but it isn't.

01:07:51.484 --> 01:07:55.821
It's I who have changed.
It's called transfer of affects.

01:07:55.989 --> 01:07:57.322
What is?

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:00.325
The fact that everything seems
so wonderful in this room.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:04.204
That's what it's called, is it?

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.998
Did the police disturb you?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:09.835
No. One ignores such trifles
on a honeymoon.

01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:16.383
- I take it this is your first honeymoon?
- Yes.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.553
I mean, it would be if it were.

01:08:28.688 --> 01:08:34.276
For what it's worth, I can't remember
ever having kissed any other woman before.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:38.529
I have nothing to remember
of that nature, either.

01:08:38.698 --> 01:08:40.532
You're very sweet.

01:08:42.410 --> 01:08:44.745
- Of course I'm no child.
- Far from it.

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.080
I'm well aware that we're all
bundles of inhibitions.

01:08:47.247 --> 01:08:48.624
Dynamite dumps!

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.459
No.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.880
- Please don't do that.
- Why not?

01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:58.050
It isn't ethical.
I'm here as your doctor.

01:08:58.216 --> 01:09:01.219
Well, you can stop worrying, Doctor.
I'm going to sleep on the couch.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.763
No, that's also unethical.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:05.223
Now, this honeymoon is complicated enough

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.267
without your dragging
medical ethics into it.

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:10.729
- I suppose the floor is out?
- The patient always sleeps in the bed.

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:14.274
The doctor occupies the couch,
fully dressed.

01:09:14.442 --> 01:09:16.484
I see you know the rules.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.745
You remember something.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.288
No.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.960
This room reminds you of something.

01:09:34.127 --> 01:09:35.796
No.

01:09:35.962 --> 01:09:37.756
You're resisting a memory.
What is in your mind?

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.341
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do! You're resisting it.

01:09:39.509 --> 01:09:40.759
Don't start that again.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.761
Don't stand there with that wiseacre look.
I'm sick of your double talk.

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.265
You were looking at the bed.
What frightens you?

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.934
White lines.

01:09:50.144 --> 01:09:53.689
When I made fork marks on the tablecloth,
they agitated you.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:56.108
The night you kissed me,
you pushed me away because of my robe.

01:09:56.275 --> 01:09:58.276
It was white, it had dark lines on it.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:01.321
Try to think. Why does the color white frighten you?
Why do lines frighten you?

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:04.116
- Think of white. White.
- It frightens me. I can't look.

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:07.369
Don't turn away. Stand still.
Look at the white spread. Look at it, remember!

01:10:15.712 --> 01:10:16.962
Darling.

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.673
Oh, darling.

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:23.427
You mustn't be frightened.

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.637
You mustn't. We are making progress.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.683
We have the word "white" on our side.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.691
Is that you, Mr. Brown?

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.445
Oh, I thought it was you.

01:14:12.323 --> 01:14:15.909
I was unable to sleep,
so I came down to work.

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:20.789
When you are old,
you don't need to sleep so much.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:24.668
I'm just having a glass of milk
and some crackers.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.211
Join me, please.

01:14:26.379 --> 01:14:28.630
I'll get another glass.

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:31.216
I'm glad to have company.

01:14:31.384 --> 01:14:35.637
Nobody likes to have
crackers and milk by himself.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:41.893
When I was a young man,
I was always saying,

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:44.938
"If I could only get alone by myself

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:47.732
"instead of wasting my time with people,

01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:49.275
"I would be happy."

01:14:50.903 --> 01:14:53.071
Now I am saying just the opposite.

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.491
This is the secret of old age.

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:59.661
Everything becomes just the opposite.

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:02.539
Do you know who makes
the most trouble in the world?

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:04.708
Old people.

01:15:04.917 --> 01:15:06.751
They are always worrying

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:11.631
what is going to be in the world tomorrow
after they are gone.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:14.926
That's why they have wars.

01:15:15.094 --> 01:15:19.139
Because old people got nothing else
they can get excited about.

01:15:23.769 --> 01:15:26.521
Well, we will drink to you,

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:31.651
to when we are young
and know nothing except living.

01:16:13.319 --> 01:16:15.904
Alex. Alex, are you all right?

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:19.991
Good morning.

01:16:20.826 --> 01:16:23.369
Yes, I am all right, thank you.

01:16:23.537 --> 01:16:26.164
- I fell asleep in the chair.
- Yes.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:28.333
- What time is it?
- 7:00.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:34.172
I was dreaming this morning
I get some real coffee.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:39.344
My husband must have gone out very early
this morning. You didn't happen...

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:42.764
He didn't go out.
He's over there on the couch.

01:16:45.184 --> 01:16:47.769
He's all right. He's sleeping fine.

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:53.191
My dear child, do you think
old Alex Brulov,

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:56.486
one of the biggest brains
who is in psychiatry,

01:16:56.654 --> 01:17:00.532
is unable to make out 
two and two come out four?

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:04.702
I should have known.

01:17:05.204 --> 01:17:09.374
The moment I see you with a husband
whose pupils are enlarged,

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.918
who has a tremor of the left hand,

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.462
who's on a honeymoon with no baggage,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:17.382
and whose name is John Brown,

01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:20.051
I know practically what is going on.

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:22.303
What happened?

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.305
Only what I expected.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:31.104
There is no use taking chances
with a possibly dangerous case.

01:17:32.106 --> 01:17:34.232
I sit here waiting.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.568
If you scream, I am ready.

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:40.905
So he comes downstairs,
and he's dangerous.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.116
I can see by his face.

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:45.493
So I keep talking

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.830
while I put some bromide
into a glass of milk.

01:17:49.623 --> 01:17:52.584
Enough to knock out three horses.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:56.129
When he falls down,
I run up to see you.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:58.173
You are sleeping like a baby,

01:17:58.340 --> 01:18:00.633
and I come back here to watch out.

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:05.138
The struggle against his condition
agitates him at times,

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:06.931
but there's no danger in him.

01:18:07.766 --> 01:18:10.977
This is what I found
in his hand last night.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.110
He didn't know he had that.
Alex, you mustn't think that.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:20.945
He didn't try to do anything to you,
he couldn't.

01:18:21.113 --> 01:18:23.448
My dear child, he's not responsible.

01:18:23.616 --> 01:18:25.617
But that's not correct.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:30.330
I'm just a little more experienced
with his type than you.

01:18:30.497 --> 01:18:33.208
I grant you know infinitely more than I do
but in this...

01:18:33.375 --> 01:18:38.046
Do not complete this sentence
with the usual female contradictions.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:40.215
You grant me I know more than you.

01:18:40.382 --> 01:18:42.342
But on the other hand
you know more than me.

01:18:42.509 --> 01:18:45.637
- Women's talk.
- Alex, what are you going to do?

01:18:45.804 --> 01:18:48.223
Something more for you, than for me.
I'm calling the police.

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:53.061
- No, no, please...
- You are giving me orders. My own pupil.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:55.605
You don't know this man,
you know only science.

01:18:55.773 --> 01:18:57.607
You know his mind,
but you don't know his heart.

01:18:57.775 --> 01:19:00.818
We are speaking of a schizophrenic,

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.946
and not a valentine.

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.907
We are speaking of a man.

01:19:06.075 --> 01:19:07.075
Oh.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:10.245
I see. Love.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:14.666
Look at you.

01:19:14.833 --> 01:19:18.711
Dr. Petersen, the promising psychoanalyst,

01:19:18.879 --> 01:19:20.546
is now all of a sudden

01:19:20.714 --> 01:19:24.425
a schoolgirl in love with an actor,
nothing else.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:28.012
- Alex, let me tell you about him.
- What is there for you to say?

01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.015
We both know that the mind
of a woman in love

01:19:31.183 --> 01:19:34.936
is operating on the lowest level
of the intellect.

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.940
Doctor told me not to smoke in the morning,
but I am too excited.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.944
You're right.

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:48.366
I'm not an analyst, not even a doctor.
I'm not talking to you as one.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:51.369
But believe me, not what I say,
but what I feel.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:53.371
The mind isn't everything.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.374
The heart can see deeper sometimes.

01:19:58.294 --> 01:20:01.212
The shock of a police investigation
might ruin his chances for recovery,

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.714
and I can save him.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:05.633
But if he killed Dr. Edwardes,
how can you help him?

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:07.385
He didn't, he didn't.

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:10.680
But if it turns out he did,
which I am good and certain it will.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.974
It won't. You yourself taught me
what Freud says.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:16.436
A man cannot do anything in amnesia
that his real character wouldn't have done.

01:20:16.603 --> 01:20:20.064
And how do you know
what his real character is?

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:22.567
I know. I know.

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:23.985
She knows.

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:28.156
This is the way science goes backward.

01:20:28.324 --> 01:20:30.283
Who told you what he is?

01:20:30.451 --> 01:20:33.244
Freud? Or a crystal ball?

01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:37.165
I couldn't feel this way toward a man
who was bad,

01:20:37.333 --> 01:20:39.375
who had committed murder.

01:20:41.754 --> 01:20:45.089
I couldn't feel this pain
for someone who was evil.

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:48.801
You are 20 times crazier than him.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:51.554
"She couldn't love him
if he was no good."

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.932
This is baby talk, nothing else.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:58.478
What do you want I should do?

01:20:58.645 --> 01:21:01.314
Give me time to treat him and cure him
before the police find him,

01:21:01.482 --> 01:21:04.150
and shock him into an incurable condition.

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:06.861
- This could take a year.
- No. No, no.

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.822
All right, half a year?

01:21:09.990 --> 01:21:12.325
We should sit and hide for half a year,

01:21:12.493 --> 01:21:16.871
waiting to find out if he's going
to cut your throat, my throat,

01:21:17.039 --> 01:21:19.832
and set fire to the house.

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.834
Oh, my dear girl.

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:23.795
Even to a woman in love,

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:27.298
such a situation must seem
a little unreasonable.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:34.305
Just a few more days, Alex,
before you turn him over.

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:37.934
Just a few more days, and then
if I can't do anything,

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:41.062
if we both can't,
then you can call the police.

01:21:42.106 --> 01:21:44.232
You're not hiding a criminal.
There's no evidence against him

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.150
except his own guilt fantasies.
He's wanted only

01:21:46.318 --> 01:21:49.112
as a possible witness
as to what happened to Dr. Edwardes.

01:21:49.279 --> 01:21:52.490
But in his present condition,
he could tell the police nothing.

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.243
Don't you see you're doing nothing
against the law?

01:21:55.411 --> 01:21:59.038
We are helping them
by investigating the patient as doctors.

01:21:59.206 --> 01:22:02.333
Doctors who want the truth
even more than they do.

01:22:06.547 --> 01:22:07.713
All right.

01:22:08.799 --> 01:22:12.343
- You'll wait?
- Go make me coffee.

01:22:12.511 --> 01:22:16.055
I'll pretend to myself
I'm acting sensible for a few days.

01:22:23.939 --> 01:22:25.106
Thank you.

01:22:25.274 --> 01:22:27.275
Thank you very much.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:34.782
I'll make you coffee, with an egg.

01:23:11.570 --> 01:23:14.238
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Brulov.

01:23:14.406 --> 01:23:16.324
Brulov? Yeah, that's right.

01:23:20.787 --> 01:23:22.914
Bromides. Who's been feeding me bromides?

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.999
I gave you, to sleep.

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:28.085
Brulov.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.465
Oh, yes. Rochester.

01:23:36.261 --> 01:23:38.095
What's your name?

01:23:39.806 --> 01:23:41.432
I don't know.

01:23:45.854 --> 01:23:48.606
- Constance told you.
- Nobody told me.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:53.194
If I don't know a patient with amnesia
when I see one, what do I know?

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.947
You don't remember your father or mother?

01:23:56.114 --> 01:23:57.114
No.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.116
- Wife or sweetheart?
- No.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:02.495
Don't fight me.
I'm going to help you, if I can.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.332
I'm going to be your father image.

01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:09.293
I want you to look on me
like your father.

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:11.295
Trust me, lean on me.

01:24:12.798 --> 01:24:16.008
It's a shortcut, but we haven't much time.

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.386
All right. Go ahead, I'm leaning.

01:24:18.554 --> 01:24:20.930
Maybe you've got something
you want to tell me,

01:24:21.098 --> 01:24:23.933
a single thought,
a few words in the corner of your head.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.935
Go on, talk to me.

01:24:26.103 --> 01:24:29.814
Whatever comes into your head,
just say what it is.

01:24:30.857 --> 01:24:32.525
There's nothing.

01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:34.860
Maybe you dreamt something?

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:40.616
- Yeah.
- What did you dream?

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:44.328
I don't believe in dreams.
That Freud stuff's a lot of hooey.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:48.082
You are a fine one to talk.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.711
You've got amnesia,
and you've got a guilt complex.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:55.256
You don't know if you are
coming or going from someplace,

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.258
but Freud is hooey.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:59.260
This you know.

01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:02.013
A wise guy.

01:25:06.393 --> 01:25:08.394
You don't like me, Papa.

01:25:09.521 --> 01:25:12.732
Do you want I should help you or not?

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:16.861
I'm sorry.

01:25:18.614 --> 01:25:21.032
I'll explain to you about dreams,

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:23.367
so you don't think it is hooey.

01:25:24.369 --> 01:25:26.287
The secrets of who you are

01:25:26.455 --> 01:25:28.623
and what has made you run away from yourself,

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:32.126
all these secrets are buried in your brain.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:34.962
But you don't want to look at them.

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:38.382
The human being very often doesn't want
to know the truth about himself,

01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:41.135
because he thinks it will make him sick.

01:25:41.303 --> 01:25:45.723
So he makes himself sicker
trying to forget.

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:47.892
- You follow this?
- Yeah.

01:25:50.437 --> 01:25:52.897
- How do you feel?
- Coffee.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:54.357
Awful.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:59.236
The patient is going to tell us
what he dreamt.

01:25:59.404 --> 01:26:02.156
Fine, I'll take notes.
I'll get my glasses.

01:26:03.241 --> 01:26:06.452
Now here's where dreams come in.

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:10.748
They tell you what you are trying to hide.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.250
But they tell it to you all mixed up,

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:16.629
like pieces of a puzzle that don't fit.

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:21.384
The problem of the analyst
is to examine this puzzle

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:24.762
and put the pieces together
in the right place.

01:26:24.930 --> 01:26:27.223
And find out what the devil

01:26:27.391 --> 01:26:30.017
you are trying to say to yourself.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.022
Let's see.

01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:39.193
I kept thinking while I was dreaming
that all this meant something,

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:42.279
that there was some other meaning in it
that I ought to find out.

01:26:42.447 --> 01:26:44.115
We'll find out.

01:26:50.664 --> 01:26:54.458
I can't make out just what sort
of a place it was.

01:27:02.884 --> 01:27:05.219
<i>It seemed to be a gambling house.</i>

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:08.973
<i>But there weren't any walls,
just a lot of curtains</i>

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.308
<i>with eyes painted on them.</i>

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:15.229
<i>A man was walking around
with a large pair of scissors</i>

01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:17.815
<i>cutting all the drapes in half.</i>

01:27:22.946 --> 01:27:24.947
<i>And then a girl came in
with hardly anything on</i>

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:28.659
<i>and started walking around the gambling room
kissing everybody.</i>

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:31.412
<i>She came to my table first.</i>

01:27:31.580 --> 01:27:34.331
Did you recognize this kissing bug?

01:27:36.877 --> 01:27:40.129
I'm afraid she looked
a little like Constance.

01:27:40.297 --> 01:27:43.132
This is plain, ordinary,
wishful dreaming.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.675
Go on.

01:27:45.260 --> 01:27:49.221
I was sitting there playing cards
with a man who had a beard.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:53.559
<i>I was dealing to him.
I turned up a seven of clubs.</i>

01:27:57.230 --> 01:28:00.483
<i>He said, "That makes 21. I win."</i>

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:02.860
<i>But when he turned up his cards,
they were blank.</i>

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:05.529
<i>Just then, the proprietor came in
and accused him of cheating.</i>

01:28:05.697 --> 01:28:10.159
<i>The proprietor yelled "This is my place.
If I catch you again, I'll fix you."</i>

01:28:13.163 --> 01:28:15.289
I'm sorry about that kissing bug.

01:28:15.457 --> 01:28:19.126
I'm glad you didn't dream of me as an eggbeater,
as one of my patients did.

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:20.628
Why? What would that mean?

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.379
Never mind.

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.882
Does it make any sense to you,
what I've dreamed?

01:28:25.050 --> 01:28:27.218
Not yet. You're trying
to tell yourself something.

01:28:27.385 --> 01:28:29.470
What it is, we'll figure out later.

01:28:30.764 --> 01:28:32.598
There's a lot more to it.

01:28:32.766 --> 01:28:35.810
Go on and try to recall the details.

01:28:35.977 --> 01:28:39.688
The more cockeyed,
the better for the scientific side of it.

01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:47.112
It was, leaning over the sloping roof
of a high building

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:50.950
<i>was the man with the beard.
I yelled at him to watch out.</i>

01:28:51.117 --> 01:28:54.328
<i>Then he went over slowly,
with his feet in the air.</i>

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:59.166
<i>And then I saw the proprietor again,
the man in the mask.</i>

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:03.921
<i>He was hiding behind a tall chimney
and he had a small wheel in his hand.</i>

01:29:06.925 --> 01:29:09.677
<i>I saw him drop the wheel on the roof.</i>

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:18.352
<i>Suddenly I was running.</i>

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:20.312
<i>Then I heard something
beating over my head.</i>

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:22.064
<i>It was a great pair of wings.</i>

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:24.108
<i>The wings chased me
and almost caught up with me</i>

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.986
<i>when I came to the bottom of the hill.</i>

01:29:29.531 --> 01:29:32.449
I must have escaped.
I don't remember.

01:29:33.451 --> 01:29:35.995
That's all there was.
I woke up and saw Dr. Brulov.

01:29:36.162 --> 01:29:38.330
- Have some coffee.
- Thanks.

01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:51.010
- Something's happening there.
- What is it?

01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:59.852
- Snow.
- The light frightened him.

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:01.312
Photophobia.

01:30:02.522 --> 01:30:04.481
No. It was the snow.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:28.422
That's the white he's afraid of.
Snow and those tracks.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.093
- What tracks?
- The sled tracks in the snow.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:35.846
The first symptom he revealed
was shock at the sight of fork lines

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:37.348
drawn on a white tablecloth.

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:41.769
And my robe, which had dark lines on it.
And last night, the white coverlet,

01:30:41.937 --> 01:30:44.355
like those dark tracks in the snow.

01:30:44.522 --> 01:30:46.690
We'll pull the blinds down.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.693
Dr. Edwardes was fond of sports.

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.780
He mentions tennis and skiing
in his book as valuable

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:55.074
in the treatment of mental disorders.

01:30:57.369 --> 01:30:58.369
Skiing.

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:01.872
Ski tracks in the snow.

01:31:03.375 --> 01:31:06.210
That's what those dark lines
symbolize for him.

01:31:06.378 --> 01:31:09.046
His horror of them means, of course,
that they are immediately connected

01:31:09.214 --> 01:31:10.714
with the cause of his amnesia.

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:13.092
Yes. A murder on skis.

01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:27.606
Where did Edwardes go for his skiing?
We must find out.

01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:29.942
Can you tell us where? Try.

01:31:30.110 --> 01:31:33.153
He has told us already in his dream.

01:31:33.321 --> 01:31:34.905
Let me see your notes.

01:31:37.575 --> 01:31:39.159
What can we do for him?

01:31:39.327 --> 01:31:41.620
You're not his mama, you're an analyst.

01:31:41.788 --> 01:31:44.957
Leave him alone.
He'll come out of this by himself.

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:47.626
The sloping roof.

01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:52.548
- That means only mountainside.
- They were skiing.

01:31:52.716 --> 01:31:55.926
The father image, the bearded man,
is Dr. Edwardes.

01:31:56.094 --> 01:31:59.596
That's very simple.
Dr. Edwardes plunged over the precipice while skiing.

01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:03.267
And then a shadow chases him
up and down a hill.

01:32:04.436 --> 01:32:06.937
That could mean he was escaping from a valley.

01:32:07.105 --> 01:32:10.941
Skiing resorts are often called valleys.
Like Sun Valley.

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:14.778
He was being pursued by a winged figure,
a witch or a harpy.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:17.448
No. The figure was you.

01:32:17.615 --> 01:32:20.868
If you grew wings,
you would be an angel.

01:32:22.162 --> 01:32:24.705
The dream's trying to tell him
the name of the resort.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.374
Angel. Angel Valley.

01:32:29.461 --> 01:32:31.712
Do you remember Angel Valley?

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:33.756
No.

01:32:33.965 --> 01:32:36.967
We can call a travel agency
and check all the resort names.

01:32:37.135 --> 01:32:39.511
It wasn't Angel Valley.

01:32:41.473 --> 01:32:43.515
I remember it.

01:32:43.683 --> 01:32:47.311
It was a place called Gabriel Valley.

01:32:48.188 --> 01:32:49.396
What else do you remember now?

01:32:49.564 --> 01:32:51.982
Who was the masked figure in your dream?

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:53.108
It was an accident.

01:32:53.276 --> 01:32:55.903
Do you remember that, a skiing accident?
Dr. Edwardes went over a snow cliff.

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:59.156
It was no accident! I can't stand this anymore.
I've had enough of it.

01:32:59.324 --> 01:33:02.076
We've got to call the police.

01:33:02.243 --> 01:33:05.746
No. We have to go to Gabriel Valley.
You've got to go with me.

01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:13.253
- This is for Cooley when he comes in.
- I'll tell him.

01:33:18.843 --> 01:33:21.178
At 4:45? Thank you. Goodbye.

01:33:23.681 --> 01:33:26.892
There's a train leaving in an hour.
We can make connections for Gabriel Valley.

01:33:27.060 --> 01:33:30.854
I know what I have to do.
I can't go on endangering you.

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.440
- I know about last night.
- Nothing happened.

01:33:33.608 --> 01:33:36.276
But it will.
I've got to end it before it does.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:39.404
I love you, but I'm not worth loving.

01:33:39.572 --> 01:33:43.242
- Darling, you can help me afterward.
- There's no help afterward.

01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.285
If you give yourself up to the police
in your condition,

01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:48.205
there's no afterwards for either of us.
I can cure you.

01:33:48.373 --> 01:33:51.041
- But you can't undo a murder.
- There is none to undo.

01:33:51.209 --> 01:33:52.251
- I killed him.
- Stop it.

01:33:52.418 --> 01:33:55.546
And now, you... Last night...
Don't try to stop me, I've got to go.

01:33:55.713 --> 01:33:57.965
Guilt, guilt, you've lived with it
for a long time, haven't you?

01:33:58.133 --> 01:33:59.133
Yes.

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.218
- Since childhood.
- What?

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:04.930
Ever since your childhood,
you've tried to run away from something.

01:34:05.098 --> 01:34:07.057
You've always felt guilty
about everything that happened around you.

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:08.767
What was it in your youth?

01:34:08.935 --> 01:34:11.562
It must have been terrible for you
to prefer to think you murdered Edwardes

01:34:11.729 --> 01:34:14.064
rather than remember what happened long ago.

01:34:14.899 --> 01:34:19.486
You said you love me. Look at me.
Then, why am I fighting for you?

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:21.905
- Because I love you. Because I need you.
- But I'm nothing.

01:34:22.073 --> 01:34:23.615
I want you to come with me
to Gabriel Valley.

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:24.783
What good will that do?

01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:27.661
When you see the hill where the accident happened,
you'll remember it.

01:34:27.829 --> 01:34:29.288
We'll go skiing together
as you did with Edwardes.

01:34:29.455 --> 01:34:30.455
I was there, I killed him.

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:33.083
You'll see your innocence,
you'll see what really happened.

01:34:33.251 --> 01:34:35.252
- You mean, because it will happen again?
- Yes.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.087
And what if I killed him?

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:44.344
Isn't it true that
if the episode's repeated,

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:47.598
I'm likely to do
the same thing I did before?

01:34:49.309 --> 01:34:51.518
Then how do you know I won't kill again?

01:34:51.686 --> 01:34:54.313
Because I'm convinced
you didn't kill in the first place.

01:34:56.441 --> 01:34:59.359
You believe in me enough
to take such a chance?

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:01.111
Of course I do.

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:03.280
We're going back to that ski run.

01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:04.948
We'll find out what it was
in your childhood

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:07.117
that's haunted you all your life.

01:35:07.285 --> 01:35:09.870
We'll also find out what happened
to Dr. Edwardes.

01:35:32.894 --> 01:35:35.062
Did you ever see her before?

01:35:37.065 --> 01:35:38.148
Let's go.

01:35:42.153 --> 01:35:46.490
I've always loved very feminine clothes,
but never quite dared to wear them.

01:35:50.703 --> 01:35:51.954
But I'm going to after this,

01:35:52.163 --> 01:35:55.165
I'm going to wear exactly the things
that please me.

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:56.375
And you.

01:36:05.927 --> 01:36:07.928
Even very funny hats.

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:13.684
You know, the kind that makes you look
a little drunk?

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:58.228
Put them on.

01:38:27.902 --> 01:38:30.070
<i>It was something in my childhood.</i>

01:38:30.238 --> 01:38:31.363
<i>Something in my childhood.</i>

01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:34.825
<i>I remember now. I killed my brother.</i>

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:50.507
I didn't kill my brother.
It was an accident. It was an accident!

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:54.511
That's what's haunted you all your life.
That was the memory you were afraid of.

01:39:17.785 --> 01:39:20.579
It's like looking into a picture book,
an old one,

01:39:20.746 --> 01:39:23.039
seeing the familiar pictures one at a time.

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:27.878
I went to Columbia Medical School,
met a girl with a giggle,

01:39:28.045 --> 01:39:30.422
who luckily married my roommate, Ken.

01:39:30.590 --> 01:39:34.134
Oh, and by the way,
my name's John Ballyntine.

01:39:34.302 --> 01:39:35.927
I'm very pleased to meet you.

01:39:36.095 --> 01:39:39.973
Another thing, my Army record's all right.
I was invalided out.

01:39:40.141 --> 01:39:42.642
I ran into Dr. Edwardes
when I was in the Cumberland Mountains,

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:45.479
trying to recover from some kind
of nerve shock I got

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:47.481
when the plane crashed.

01:39:47.648 --> 01:39:49.483
He was on vacation
but I asked him to help me,

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:51.401
and he invited me to go skiing with him.

01:39:51.569 --> 01:39:54.905
We went through New York.
I seem to remember

01:39:55.072 --> 01:39:59.075
going to lunch somewhere.
It's still a little vague about that luncheon part.

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:03.079
Then we arrived here,
and the accident happened at that spot.

01:40:03.915 --> 01:40:05.624
Where you saved me.

01:40:05.791 --> 01:40:09.085
Now, let's not have any confusion
about who saved whom.

01:40:09.795 --> 01:40:13.465
Yes, he went over there, all right.
It's still a little foggy.

01:40:13.633 --> 01:40:15.926
But I do know that Edwardes
was about 50 feet ahead of me

01:40:16.093 --> 01:40:17.761
when he went over. I saw him plunge.

01:40:17.929 --> 01:40:20.931
That was the thing that set you off.
That stirred up your old guilt complex

01:40:21.098 --> 01:40:22.974
and made you think that you'd killed him.

01:40:23.142 --> 01:40:25.060
Then you had to run away from that, too.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:27.062
Then you took on the role of Dr. Edwardes

01:40:27.271 --> 01:40:31.441
to prove to yourself he wasn't dead,
so therefore, you had not killed him.

01:40:31.609 --> 01:40:36.947
Professor, I never quite realized
in my amnesic state how lovely you are.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:40.408
Now that you got your head back,
you mustn't lose it again.

01:40:40.618 --> 01:40:43.453
It's too late. I'm beyond cure.

01:40:44.288 --> 01:40:46.289
How does it feel to be a great analyst?

01:40:46.457 --> 01:40:47.791
Not so bad.

01:40:47.959 --> 01:40:50.335
- And a great detective?
- Wonderful.

01:40:51.295 --> 01:40:52.796
And madly adored?

01:40:54.048 --> 01:40:55.465
Very wonderful.

01:40:56.634 --> 01:40:59.344
You'll look wonderful in white

01:40:59.512 --> 01:41:02.973
with a little orange blossom in your hair.

01:41:03.140 --> 01:41:06.351
That sounds vaguely as if
it had something to do with marriage.

01:41:06.519 --> 01:41:09.312
That's a brilliant analysis, Doctor.

01:41:14.402 --> 01:41:15.402
Hello.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:18.905
You know Lieutenant Cooley
and Sergeant Gillespie from Rochester?

01:41:19.073 --> 01:41:20.448
Yes, yes, we know them quite well.

01:41:20.658 --> 01:41:21.741
How did you find us?

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:23.577
With no thanks to your friend,
Dr. Brulov.

01:41:23.744 --> 01:41:27.747
We made a few inquiries at the railroad station.
You left a trail a mile wide.

01:41:27.915 --> 01:41:29.207
You arrived just in the nick of time.

01:41:29.375 --> 01:41:31.501
I believe that's the usual expression.

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:35.213
We found the body of Dr. Edwardes.

01:41:35.381 --> 01:41:38.758
It's almost exactly where you told
the local police it would be.

01:41:38.926 --> 01:41:42.512
- You remember the spot very well.
- Thank goodness it's all cleared up.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:45.056
Not quite, Dr. Petersen.

01:41:45.224 --> 01:41:47.517
I'm afraid a bullet was found in the body.

01:41:53.399 --> 01:41:55.108
That's impossible.

01:41:55.276 --> 01:41:58.236
- It was in his back.
- The case is one of murder.

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:02.032
We shall have to detain you, sir.

01:42:02.199 --> 01:42:05.577
It's my duty to inform you that anything you say
may be used against you.

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:14.794
No.

01:42:14.962 --> 01:42:16.212
You mustn't say you killed him.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:19.132
Try to remember what happened
before Edwardes went over.

01:42:19.884 --> 01:42:22.010
But when he said he killed him,
he wasn't himself.

01:42:22.219 --> 01:42:24.387
He was in a state of great mental distress.

01:42:25.222 --> 01:42:26.765
You can't put him away. You can't!

01:42:26.932 --> 01:42:29.768
It'll destroy his mind.
Don't you understand?

01:42:30.936 --> 01:42:32.562
Goodbye, my dear.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:38.068
We won't give up hope.
I'm going to fight and fight and get you free.

01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:47.118
My dear girl,

01:42:47.286 --> 01:42:51.331
you cannot keep bumping your head
against reality

01:42:51.499 --> 01:42:53.583
and saying it is not there.

01:42:54.460 --> 01:42:56.670
The evidence was definite.

01:42:56.837 --> 01:42:59.923
We can't remove it by wishing or crying.

01:43:02.510 --> 01:43:04.135
He trusted me.

01:43:04.303 --> 01:43:06.971
I led him into a trap.
I convicted him.

01:43:08.224 --> 01:43:09.974
Is that real enough for you?

01:43:10.142 --> 01:43:12.435
There is no one to blame.

01:43:13.437 --> 01:43:17.148
The case was a little deeper
than you figured.

01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:19.359
This often happens.

01:43:19.527 --> 01:43:21.611
You must realize now one thing.

01:43:21.779 --> 01:43:24.280
It is over for both of you.

01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:26.866
It's not over.

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:29.869
- You will have other cases.
- It's not over. It never will be.

01:43:30.037 --> 01:43:33.498
Don't ask me to stop, I can't. I can't.

01:43:38.295 --> 01:43:41.172
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry, I...

01:43:45.553 --> 01:43:49.180
Thanks for straightening things out
with Dr. Murchison

01:43:49.348 --> 01:43:51.015
and everyone.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:44:00.692
It is very sad

01:44:00.860 --> 01:44:02.902
to love and lose somebody.

01:44:04.238 --> 01:44:06.573
But in a while, you'll forget,

01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:09.743
and you will take up the threads
of your life

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:12.495
where you left off not so long ago

01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.956
and you will work hard.

01:44:15.166 --> 01:44:18.585
There's lots of happiness in working hard.

01:44:18.753 --> 01:44:20.170
Maybe the most.

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:25.300
I will write to you.

01:44:29.013 --> 01:44:30.388
Oh, Alex.

01:44:31.599 --> 01:44:33.183
You're very good.

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:40.857
I'm sorry to hurry you, Dr. Brulov,
but your car is waiting.

01:44:41.025 --> 01:44:44.027
- You have just time.
- Thank you.

01:44:44.195 --> 01:44:46.821
I'm always late, always forgetting.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:20.063
A brilliant man.

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:22.232
I should have gone to the station with him.

01:45:22.399 --> 01:45:23.942
You're too tired.

01:45:24.109 --> 01:45:26.986
I know that feeling of exhaustion
only too well.

01:45:27.154 --> 01:45:29.447
One must humor it, or it explodes.

01:45:30.282 --> 01:45:33.868
I shall try to help you in every way.

01:45:34.036 --> 01:45:36.454
- You will take care of yourself?
- Yes.

01:45:36.622 --> 01:45:39.791
And try to forget things better forgotten.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:43.169
You've got a great career
ahead of you, Constance.

01:45:43.337 --> 01:45:46.589
Thank you. Well, at least
one good thing came out of all this.

01:45:46.757 --> 01:45:48.758
You are back at Green Manors.

01:45:48.926 --> 01:45:52.011
Who knows what would have happened
to the place under Dr. Edwardes?

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:54.639
I knew Edwardes only slightly.

01:45:54.807 --> 01:45:57.183
I never really liked him.

01:45:57.351 --> 01:46:00.478
But he was a good man,
in a way, I suppose.

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:04.274
Well, good night, Constance.

01:46:04.441 --> 01:46:06.484
I hope you feel rested in the morning.

01:46:14.535 --> 01:46:17.453
<i>I knew Edwardes only slightly.</i>

01:46:17.621 --> 01:46:19.789
<i>I never liked him very well.</i>

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:23.626
<i>I knew Edwardes only slightly.</i>

01:46:24.795 --> 01:46:26.629
<i>Knew Edwardes slightly.</i>

01:46:28.132 --> 01:46:30.300
<i>Knew Edwardes.</i>

01:46:30.467 --> 01:46:32.302
<i>Knew Edwardes slightly.</i>

01:46:33.637 --> 01:46:35.305
<i>Knew Edwardes.</i>

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:37.473
<i>Knew.</i>

01:46:38.767 --> 01:46:40.059
<i>Knew.</i>

01:46:41.478 --> 01:46:42.645
<i>Knew.</i>

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:52.423
Come in.

01:47:54.051 --> 01:47:56.386
I want to talk to you, Dr. Murchison.

01:47:57.554 --> 01:48:00.223
It's rather late, and you need rest, Constance.

01:48:00.391 --> 01:48:02.225
I must talk to you.

01:48:02.393 --> 01:48:05.019
Nocturnal confidences are bad for the nerves.

01:48:05.229 --> 01:48:07.230
- Is it something about your work?
- Yes.

01:48:07.398 --> 01:48:10.274
- Can't it wait till morning?
- It can't wait.

01:48:11.276 --> 01:48:12.777
Do sit down.

01:48:15.406 --> 01:48:18.282
Now, what's your problem?

01:48:20.077 --> 01:48:22.161
It is a dream one of my patients reported.

01:48:22.329 --> 01:48:24.247
May I ask who the patient is?

01:48:25.541 --> 01:48:27.417
The patient is John Ballyntine.

01:48:28.502 --> 01:48:30.253
I fancied that.

01:48:31.255 --> 01:48:33.840
You're still working on
the possibility of his innocence.

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:35.466
Charming loyalty.

01:48:35.634 --> 01:48:39.095
One of your most
attractive characteristics, Constance.

01:48:40.139 --> 01:48:41.848
What did he dream?

01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:44.767
He dreamt he was in a gambling house,
it was full of odd people

01:48:44.935 --> 01:48:46.602
playing with blank cards.

01:48:48.188 --> 01:48:50.440
Blank cards.

01:48:50.607 --> 01:48:53.317
Obviously the patient was trying to deny
it was a gambling house

01:48:53.485 --> 01:48:55.611
by dreaming of spurious cards.

01:48:56.113 --> 01:48:59.115
One of the people in the place went around
cutting the drapes in half.

01:48:59.283 --> 01:49:02.994
Another was a scantily dressed girl
who was kissing everybody.

01:49:03.162 --> 01:49:06.456
With a little effort, one could almost imagine
the inmates of Green Manors.

01:49:06.623 --> 01:49:09.167
That's what I had in mind,
Dr. Murchison.

01:49:11.128 --> 01:49:13.880
Interesting notion to play around with, isn't it?

01:49:14.048 --> 01:49:15.173
Do go on.

01:49:16.675 --> 01:49:20.303
There were eyes painted on the curtains
around the walls.

01:49:20.471 --> 01:49:21.929
Oh.

01:49:22.139 --> 01:49:23.473
The guards at Green Manors.

01:49:25.100 --> 01:49:28.227
The patient was playing cards,
now no longer blank.

01:49:28.395 --> 01:49:31.689
A game of twenty-one with a bearded man
who was evidently Dr. Edwardes.

01:49:31.857 --> 01:49:35.818
Yes, one usually dreams of one's analyst
as authority with a beard.

01:49:35.986 --> 01:49:39.030
He dealt Edwardes the seven of clubs,
and Edwardes said,

01:49:39.198 --> 01:49:41.199
"That makes it 21."

01:49:42.367 --> 01:49:45.828
I would say the patient
was trying to mention a locale.

01:49:45.996 --> 01:49:48.414
The seven of clubs might mean a club.

01:49:48.832 --> 01:49:51.084
Yes, with the word "twenty-one" in it.

01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:54.253
There is such a place in New York.
It's called the 21 Club.

01:49:54.838 --> 01:49:55.838
I've heard of it.

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.178
The patient dreamt

01:50:02.346 --> 01:50:06.140
the proprietor of the place came in
and began accusing Dr. Edwardes of cheating.

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:09.435
He ordered Edwardes out and said,
"I won't allow you to play here.

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:12.021
This is my place.
I'm going to fix you."

01:50:12.731 --> 01:50:15.775
The dream gives the locale
a double identity.

01:50:15.943 --> 01:50:18.486
The 21 Club and Green Manors.

01:50:18.695 --> 01:50:22.031
The proprietor seems to belong
more to the latter.

01:50:23.117 --> 01:50:24.200
In fact...

01:50:25.202 --> 01:50:29.622
I would say that this angry proprietor
who threatened Dr. Edwardes...

01:50:30.874 --> 01:50:32.458
was myself.

01:50:34.878 --> 01:50:36.879
It seemed that way to me.

01:50:41.093 --> 01:50:44.470
I presume you only arrived
at this solution tonight?

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:47.140
Yes.

01:50:47.307 --> 01:50:50.977
And have confided your
psychoanalytic findings to nobody?

01:50:51.145 --> 01:50:52.228
Not yet.

01:50:57.109 --> 01:50:59.569
Was there any more to the dream?

01:50:59.736 --> 01:51:00.778
Yes.

01:51:00.946 --> 01:51:05.116
The patient dreamt he and Dr. Edwardes
were on a high sloping roof,

01:51:05.284 --> 01:51:08.452
and that he saw Edwardes
plunge over the edge to his death.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:11.873
He also saw the angry proprietor
hiding behind the chimney laughing,

01:51:12.082 --> 01:51:15.585
holding a small wheel in his hand.
He dropped the wheel.

01:51:17.129 --> 01:51:20.173
The symbolism of the small wheel
escapes me.

01:51:22.843 --> 01:51:24.468
It was a revolver.

01:51:25.971 --> 01:51:28.764
The proprietor who threatened Edwardes' life
in the 21 Club

01:51:28.932 --> 01:51:31.684
dropped a revolver in the snow
in Gabriel Valley

01:51:31.852 --> 01:51:34.604
after shooting Dr. Edwardes in the back.

01:51:34.771 --> 01:51:37.982
The weapon is still there
at the foot of a tree

01:51:38.150 --> 01:51:40.193
with the murderer's fingerprints on it.

01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:44.447
I can't agree with this part
of your interpretation,

01:51:44.615 --> 01:51:47.617
for the good reason that the weapon
is now in my hand.

01:51:50.162 --> 01:51:52.330
I imagined something
of this sort would happen

01:51:52.497 --> 01:51:54.999
when I made the slip tonight
about knowing Edwardes.

01:51:55.167 --> 01:51:57.627
That started your agile,
young mind going.

01:51:57.794 --> 01:52:00.713
You were having a breakdown.

01:52:00.881 --> 01:52:05.468
In a state of panic, you heard
that Edwardes was to take your place here.

01:52:05.636 --> 01:52:07.720
So you sought him out
in his favorite restaurant,

01:52:07.888 --> 01:52:10.556
where he was lunching
with John Ballyntine.

01:52:10.724 --> 01:52:13.809
You accused him of stealing your job.

01:52:13.977 --> 01:52:16.312
You threatened to kill him.

01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:20.691
He calmed you down, told you
he was off on a skiing vacation.

01:52:20.859 --> 01:52:23.027
You followed him there

01:52:23.195 --> 01:52:25.488
and shot him from behind a tree.

01:52:25.656 --> 01:52:28.241
That's enough. Your story is ridiculous.

01:52:28.408 --> 01:52:30.159
You'll make a fool of yourself.

01:52:30.327 --> 01:52:33.162
A love-smitten analyst
playing a dream detective.

01:52:33.664 --> 01:52:36.707
There'll be no dreams for the police.

01:52:36.875 --> 01:52:40.878
They'll find out from the waiters
in the 21 Club that you were there.

01:52:41.046 --> 01:52:45.549
You'll be identified as the man
who had a row with Dr. Edwardes.

01:52:45.717 --> 01:52:48.010
There will be people who saw you
on the train to Gabriel Valley,

01:52:48.178 --> 01:52:49.679
who saw you there.

01:52:51.265 --> 01:52:54.183
There will be no dreams
necessary for this case.

01:52:55.435 --> 01:52:56.686
I see.

01:52:59.648 --> 01:53:03.901
You're an excellent analyst, Dr. Petersen, 
but a rather stupid woman.

01:53:05.195 --> 01:53:09.031
What did you think I'd do
when you told me all this? Congratulate you?

01:53:10.742 --> 01:53:14.996
You forget in your imbecilic devotion
to your patient

01:53:15.205 --> 01:53:17.873
that the punishment for two murders

01:53:18.041 --> 01:53:19.917
is the same as for one.

01:53:22.379 --> 01:53:25.923
You're not going to commit
a second murder, Dr. Murchison.

01:53:26.258 --> 01:53:30.136
I hadn't planned to, but you're here.

01:53:31.305 --> 01:53:32.722
You're not leaving.

01:53:34.099 --> 01:53:39.145
A man with your intelligence
does not commit a stupid murder.

01:53:39.313 --> 01:53:41.522
You're thinking you were not
mentally responsible

01:53:41.690 --> 01:53:43.899
for that other crime in the snow.

01:53:44.067 --> 01:53:47.903
They'll find extenuating circumstances
in the state of your health.

01:53:48.071 --> 01:53:51.657
They'll not execute you
for the death of Dr. Edwardes.

01:53:51.825 --> 01:53:55.745
You can still live, read, write, research,

01:53:56.913 --> 01:53:58.998
even if you are put away.

01:53:59.833 --> 01:54:02.626
You're thinking that now, Dr. Murchison.

01:54:07.174 --> 01:54:11.427
If you shoot now,
it is cold, deliberate murder.

01:54:11.595 --> 01:54:14.597
You'll be tried as a sane murderer,

01:54:14.765 --> 01:54:17.266
convicted as a sane man,

01:54:17.434 --> 01:54:21.103
and killed in the electric chair
for your crime.

01:54:21.271 --> 01:54:24.607
I'm going to telephone the police now,
Dr. Murchison.

01:54:43.377 --> 01:54:45.169
And remember what I say.

01:54:45.337 --> 01:54:49.006
Any husband of Constance
is a husband of mine, so to speak.

01:54:49.174 --> 01:54:50.508
All right.

01:54:50.675 --> 01:54:52.385
- Goodbye. Good luck.
- Goodbye.
