00:42.835 --> 00:46.296
<i>Oh</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.424
<i>A newlywed couple just moved to town</i>

00:49.842 --> 00:53.011
<i>A regular husband and wife </i>

01:46.106 --> 01:48.358

01:48.442 --> 01:51.945

-Aren't we a fine pair?
-(WANDA CHUCKLES)

01:56.241 --> 02:01.121
What do you say to silver dollar pancakes,
crispy hash browns, bacon, eggs,

02:01.205 --> 02:03.373
freshly squeezed orange juice,
and black coffee?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.542
I say, "Oh, I don't eat food."

02:06.502 --> 02:08.879
Well, that explains
the empty refrigerator.

02:11.340 --> 02:12.382
-Wanda?
-WANDA: Hmm?

02:12.883 --> 02:15.052
Is there something special about today?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.638
Well, I know the apron
is a bit much, dear,

02:17.721 --> 02:19.973
but I am doing my best to blend in.

02:20.057 --> 02:21.391
No, no, there on the calendar.

02:21.475 --> 02:25.062
Someone's drawn a little heart
right above today's date.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.065
-Oh, yes, the heart.
-Hmm...

02:29.274 --> 02:31.276
Well, don't tell me
you have forgotten, Vis.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.402
"Forgotten"?

02:32.486 --> 02:34.988
Oh, Wanda, I'm incapable of forgetfulness.
I remember everything.

02:35.072 --> 02:38.659
That's not an exaggeration.
In fact, I'm incapable of exaggeration.

02:38.742 --> 02:41.703
Well, then tell me what's so important
about today's date.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.040
What was the question again?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.334
Oh, well,
perhaps, you've forgotten yourself.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.212
Me? Heavens, no.
I've been so looking forward to it.

02:50.295 --> 02:51.713
As have I.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.465
Today, we are celebrating...

02:54.049 --> 02:55.384
You bet we are.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.720
-It's the first time we...
-Mmm-hmm.

02:58.804 --> 03:01.557
...have ever celebrated
this occasion before.

03:01.640 --> 03:03.225
It's a special day!

03:03.308 --> 03:05.352
-Perhaps an evening...
-Of great significance...

03:05.435 --> 03:06.520
-To us both!
-Naturally.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.063
-Obviously.
-Exactly.

03:08.981 --> 03:09.982
Well done, us.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.900
(EXHALES) All right.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.361
Well, that's me off to work, then.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.113
Oh, don't forget!

03:17.030 --> 03:18.156
I haven't.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.242
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

03:26.123 --> 03:27.124
Have a good day, dear!

(KNOCK AT DOOR)

03:49.021 --> 03:50.022
Oh!

03:50.105 --> 03:52.858
Hello, dear.
I'm Agnes, your neighbor to the right.

03:52.983 --> 03:54.484
My right, not yours.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.487
Forgive me for not stopping by sooner
to welcome you to the block.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.115
My mother-in-law was in town, so I wasn't.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.575
(CHUCKLES)

04:01.658 --> 04:03.827
So, what's your name? Where are you from?

04:03.911 --> 04:06.455
And most importantly,
how's your bridge game, hon?

04:08.373 --> 04:09.374
I'm Wanda.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.127
Wanda. Charmed.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.714
Golly, you settled in fast!

04:15.797 --> 04:17.341
Did you use a moving company?

04:17.841 --> 04:21.345
I sure did.
Those boxes don't move themselves.

04:21.470 --> 04:22.471
(AGNES CHUCKLES)

04:22.721 --> 04:26.850
So what's a single gal like you doing
rattling around this big house?

04:26.934 --> 04:28.185
Oh, no, I'm not single.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.728
Oh, I don't see a ring.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.147
Well, I assure you I'm married.

04:32.314 --> 04:34.691
To a man. A human one and tall.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.195
As a matter of fact, he'll be home
later tonight for a special occasion.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.404
Just the two of us.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.864
Oh, is it somebody's birthday?

04:40.948 --> 04:42.533
Not a birthday.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.284
Well, today isn't a holiday, is it?

04:44.368 --> 04:46.703
No, it's not a holiday.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.205
An anniversary then?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.540
Ye... Yes!

04:49.623 --> 04:52.376
Yes! It's our anniversary!

04:52.459 --> 04:54.962
Oh, how marvelous!

04:55.045 --> 04:56.380
How many years?

04:56.964 --> 04:59.591
Well, it feels like
we've always been together.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.093
Lucky gal.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.054
The only way
Ralph would remember our anniversary

05:04.137 --> 05:06.265
is if there was a beer named June 2nd.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.474
(CHUCKLES)

05:07.558 --> 05:10.060
-So, what do you have planned?
-How do you mean?

05:10.143 --> 05:11.687
For your special night.

05:12.271 --> 05:14.648
A young thing like you
doesn't have to do much,

05:14.773 --> 05:17.025
but it's still fun to set the scene.

05:17.568 --> 05:21.780
Say, I was just reading
a crackerjack magazine article

05:21.864 --> 05:25.909
called "How To Treat Your Husband
To Keep Your Husband,"

05:25.993 --> 05:28.579
and let me tell you,
what Ralph could really use

05:28.662 --> 05:32.416
is, "How To Goose Your Wife
So You Don't Lose Your Wife."

05:33.959 --> 05:37.212
Hang on. I'll go grab it
and we can start planning.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.631
Oh, this is gonna be a gas!

05:49.808 --> 05:52.352
<i>You just put on your coat and hat</i>

05:53.228 --> 05:57.774
Here are those computational forms
that you requested, Norm.

05:58.525 --> 05:59.526
There you go.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.613
Gee willikers, that was fast!

06:03.655 --> 06:05.574
Hey, the music
isn't bothering you, is it, pal?

06:05.657 --> 06:07.201
In terms of distraction from work,

06:07.284 --> 06:09.620
or the largely nonsensical
nature of the lyrics?

06:10.829 --> 06:13.290
-The first one.
-Ah, no, thank you, Norm.

06:14.583 --> 06:17.085
Hey, is there somethin'
I can help you with, buddy?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.463
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is.

06:19.546 --> 06:24.718
Would you be so good as to tell me
what it is we do here exactly?

06:25.469 --> 06:27.179
Do we make something?

06:27.262 --> 06:28.555
-No.
-Right.

06:28.639 --> 06:31.058
Do we buy or sell something?

06:31.141 --> 06:32.351
No and no.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.728
Then what is the purpose of this company?

06:35.312 --> 06:39.399
All I know is, since you've gotten here,
productivity has gone up 300%.

06:39.525 --> 06:41.735
Yes, but what is it we're producing?

06:41.818 --> 06:43.195
Computational forms.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.697
And no one can process the data
quite like you do, pal.

06:45.781 --> 06:47.491
You're like a walking computer.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.618
What? I most certainly am not.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.788
I'm a regular carbon-based employee
made entirely of organic matter,

06:52.871 --> 06:54.831
much like yourself, Norm.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.751
Hey! What's got your feathers all ruffled?

06:59.002 --> 07:00.838
Yes, I'm sorry, I'm a tad on edge.

07:00.921 --> 07:03.924
You see, it appears
there's something special about today,

07:04.007 --> 07:05.634
special to Wanda, that's my wife,

07:05.717 --> 07:09.680
and gee, I can't, for the life of me,
recall what it is.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.640
Mmm... Oh!

07:13.809 --> 07:14.810
MR. HART: Good to see you.

07:15.394 --> 07:16.645
-Vision.
-Yes?

07:16.728 --> 07:18.689
Wife and I
are looking forward to this evening.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.775
Mr. Hart. Of course!

07:22.317 --> 07:25.195
Dinner with Mr. Hart
and his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart.

07:25.279 --> 07:27.030
That's what I said.
What's wrong with you?

07:27.114 --> 07:30.409
-Have you got a screw loose?
-Oh, no, sir. Screws all tightened, sir.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.035
Yes, I should hope so.

07:32.578 --> 07:34.079
Employee dinners
are a rite of passage

07:34.162 --> 07:35.539
-for the new hires.
-Ah.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.416
Jones over there failed miserably.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.750
Isn't that right, Jones?

07:39.126 --> 07:41.420
The wife thought
five courses would be sufficient.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.381
And there was that paltry excuse
for entertainment.

07:45.257 --> 07:46.466
A string quartet?

07:46.550 --> 07:50.262
And then you had that embarrassing display
of beatnik enthusiasm.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.722
I wore a turtleneck.

07:53.223 --> 07:55.851
Yes. Best of luck out there
in the unemployment line, Jones.

07:56.894 --> 07:59.730
You know, I owe my success
to being a keen judge of character.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.191
No skeletons in your closet, eh, Vision?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.110
I don't have a skeleton, sir.

08:05.736 --> 08:09.281
Glad to hear it.
Your future in this company depends on it.

AGNES: And you don't have a song?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.750
Nothing special you played
at your wedding?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.043
No, nothing special.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.253
I'll just loan you some records then.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.383
So, we've got music covered,
decor, wardrobe. Oh!

08:28.967 --> 08:30.802
What about seduction techniques?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.846
Oh, I have those.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.806
(CHUCKLES) Of course, you do.

08:35.599 --> 08:37.976
Just out of curiosity, what does it say?

08:38.560 --> 08:42.606
That you should stumble when
you walk into a room so he can catch you.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.066
It's romantic.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.734
Any other tricks?

08:45.817 --> 08:49.780
You could point out that the death rate of
single men is twice that of married men.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.533
Now, that's romantic.

Don't worry, dear.
I have everything under control.

09:08.215 --> 09:09.675
Oh, well, that is a relief.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.261
I must confess, I'm really rather nervous.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.429
"Nervous"? Whatever for?

09:14.513 --> 09:17.015
Well, you know, darling,
I still get a little tongue-tied.

09:17.808 --> 09:21.687
Vis, after all this time...

09:21.770 --> 09:23.772
There's an awful lot
riding on this one, Wanda.

If tonight doesn't go just so,
I think this could be the end.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.906
Well, it's just one night.
There's no need to get dramatic.

09:32.990 --> 09:35.826
Look, I think the best course of action
is to impress the wife.

09:35.909 --> 09:39.997
And I think the best course of action
is to impress the husband.

09:41.081 --> 09:42.124

Oh, the meaning of it!

11:18.470 --> 11:20.806
You want to know the meaning of it
and the meaning of it

12:04.850 --> 12:07.269
Well, if you don't know,
I'm not going to tell you!

12:08.228 --> 12:11.398
That... That man through there
is my boss, Mr. Hart!

12:11.481 --> 12:13.233
And his dear lady wife, Mrs. Hart!

12:13.317 --> 12:16.069
The heart on the calendar
was an abbreviation!

12:16.153 --> 12:19.323
You move at the speed of sound and I can
make a pen float through the air.

12:19.406 --> 12:20.824
Who needs to abbreviate?

12:20.908 --> 12:23.952
Darling, listen, it's all romantic
to do the candles, the music,

12:24.036 --> 12:25.871
-that stunning outfit...
-Well...

12:25.954 --> 12:28.248
I don't wanna be unappreciative,
but right now...

12:28.332 --> 12:30.751
Your boss and his wife
are expecting a home-cooked meal.

12:30.834 --> 12:31.835
-Exactly.
-(SIGHS)

12:32.920 --> 12:33.962
Any chance they'd settle

12:34.046 --> 12:36.673
for a single chocolate-covered strawberry
split three ways?

12:36.757 --> 12:38.008
Uh...

12:38.091 --> 12:39.593
I might have a better idea.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.305
Hmm.

12:43.555 --> 12:47.309
So I said, "If we orient the forms
horizontally rather than vertically,

12:47.893 --> 12:51.188
"we can use twice the paper,
we can bill twice the cost."

12:51.271 --> 12:52.648
(LAUGHS)

12:52.773 --> 12:54.650
You truly are a pioneer!

12:54.733 --> 12:57.361
But the larger purpose of the forms is...

12:57.486 --> 12:59.321
Was to analyze our input and our output.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.405
Huh.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.242
You're awfully dense, aren't you, Vision?

13:06.119 --> 13:07.704
Oh, Agnes! You're a life-saver!

13:07.788 --> 13:09.331
What kind of housewife would I be

13:09.414 --> 13:12.709
if I didn't have a gourmet meal for four
just lying about the place?

13:12.793 --> 13:13.794
-(LAUGHS)
-Well...

13:13.877 --> 13:16.421
Not that Ralph ever wants to eat
anything but baked beans

13:16.505 --> 13:19.424
which explains a lot
about his personal appeal, mind you.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.802
-Oh, my!
-Oh! Oh!

13:21.885 --> 13:23.846
Do you think Wanda needs help
in the kitchen?

13:23.929 --> 13:26.640
We haven't any tidbits
or tartlets out here,

13:26.723 --> 13:27.850
nary a pig in a blanket.

13:27.933 --> 13:29.142
No, that... (CHUCKLES)

13:29.518 --> 13:31.603
-No, that's so kind of you, Mrs. Hart.
-(CLATTERING)

13:31.687 --> 13:33.856
But I'm sure
she's absolutely fine in there!

13:33.939 --> 13:36.316
Oh, thank you, Agnes.
I think I've got it covered from here.

13:36.441 --> 13:37.568
-Oh, are you sure, dear?
-Hmm.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.904
Many hands make light work.
And many mouths make good gossip.

13:40.988 --> 13:42.406
You're so naughty! (LAUGHS)

13:42.489 --> 13:44.408
Oh, shall I just pre-heat
the oven then, dear?

13:44.491 --> 13:46.827
-That won't be necessary.
-Oh, All right, then.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.830
Well, I know you're in a pinch
so this menu can be done in a snap.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.624
Lobster Thermidor with
mini-minced meat turnovers to start.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.752
Chicken à la King with twice-cooked
new potatoes for your second course,

13:55.836 --> 13:58.213
and Steak Diane and mint jellies
for your main.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.507
Do you set your own jellies, dear?

14:00.591 --> 14:02.593
-Yes.
-Good girl.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.678
Recipe cards are on the counter there.

14:04.761 --> 14:06.013
Bon appétit!

14:06.096 --> 14:07.514
(CHUCKLES) Oh!

14:10.893 --> 14:12.019
Oh, oh.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.145
You men stay put.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.607
-I sense a domestic emergency, so...
-Mrs. Hart, please don't. You can't.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.525
You... Please...

14:18.609 --> 14:22.654
<i>Yeah, take out the papers and the trash</i>

14:22.738 --> 14:25.073
<i>Or you won't get no spending cash</i>

14:26.491 --> 14:28.869
<i>If you don't scrub the kitchen floor</i>

14:30.078 --> 14:31.830
<i>You ain't gonna rock and roll no more</i>

14:31.914 --> 14:33.790
<i>Yakety yak!</i>
<i>Don't talk back</i>

14:36.627 --> 14:37.628
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

14:38.504 --> 14:42.508
Well, why don't we have a nice
sing-a-long, all together then, shall we?

14:45.427 --> 14:47.054
(GASPS) Oh, no, too much!

14:50.140 --> 14:52.142
Oh, no, not enough!

14:53.018 --> 14:55.479
(SINGING) <i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

14:55.562 --> 14:57.314
<i>Ee-I-Ee-I-O</i>

14:57.397 --> 14:59.399
<i>And on that farm he had a...</i>

15:01.818 --> 15:02.819
<i>had a...</i>

15:03.445 --> 15:04.446
<i>Pig.</i>

15:04.530 --> 15:06.073
<i>Ee-I-Ee-I-O</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:07.157
<i>-With a...</i>
<i>-Oink, oink...</i>

15:07.241 --> 15:08.283
<i>-Here and a...</i>
<i>-Oink, oink...</i>

15:08.367 --> 15:09.952
<i>-There</i>
<i>-Here an oink, there an oink</i>

15:10.035 --> 15:11.119
<i>Everywhere an oink, oink</i>

15:11.203 --> 15:13.330
<i>Old MacDonald had a farm</i>

15:13.413 --> 15:14.915
<i>Ee-I-Ee-I-O</i>

15:14.998 --> 15:17.668
Oh, what was I supposed to do next?
Oh, what was the main course again?

15:17.751 --> 15:19.294
It was... Steak...

15:19.378 --> 15:20.754
No. Steak...

15:20.838 --> 15:22.589
Steak... Diane!

15:22.673 --> 15:23.715
Yes?

15:24.800 --> 15:27.135
Oh, I think that must be
my wife summoning me.

15:27.678 --> 15:29.304
She calls you "Diane?"

15:30.305 --> 15:33.058
Yes, it's her pet name for me.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.309
(SIGHS)

15:34.393 --> 15:37.229
I'm just coming, Fred.

15:39.064 --> 15:40.190
Excuse me a moment.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.237
(GASPS) Oh, no.

15:46.864 --> 15:48.323
How can I be of assistance?

15:48.407 --> 15:51.910
Well, the chicken is no longer a chicken
and the lobsters just flew the coop

15:51.994 --> 15:53.620
so the steak is the last man standing.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.291
It says here I can cut down the prep time
with a meat tenderizer.

15:57.374 --> 15:59.543
Excellent plan. Where's the tenderizer?

15:59.626 --> 16:01.336
-I'm looking at him.
-Ah.

16:01.420 --> 16:02.462
Hoo-hoo in there!

16:02.546 --> 16:04.339
WANDA: (GASPS) Hoo-hoo back to you!

16:04.840 --> 16:05.841
Okay.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.636
Finish the meat, find the lobsters.
I'll be right back.

16:11.221 --> 16:12.556
I hope you're hungry.

16:12.639 --> 16:13.891
Starved, is more like it.

16:13.974 --> 16:16.393
My head is starting to feel woozy.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.439
Were either of you aware

16:20.522 --> 16:23.859
that married men are killing single men
at an alarming rate?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.612
-What are you going on about?
-(LOUD THUD)

16:26.695 --> 16:27.905
And what's going on in there?

16:27.988 --> 16:30.532
Whoo-hoo! Ho-ho! (GASPS)

16:30.616 --> 16:32.159
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

16:33.327 --> 16:34.369
Who could that be?

16:34.953 --> 16:36.205
Coming!

16:37.331 --> 16:39.208
Oh, you didn't answer the back door.

16:39.291 --> 16:40.918
For your upside-down cake.

16:41.001 --> 16:42.920
Oh! Hi, I...

16:43.003 --> 16:44.004
Who was that?

16:44.087 --> 16:45.589
-A salesman!
-Telegram!

16:45.672 --> 16:47.466
A man selling telegrams.

16:47.549 --> 16:49.635
Wouldn't you know it.
Good news is more expensive.

16:50.511 --> 16:53.680
I couldn't find the lobsters and did you
want the meat tender or pulverized?

16:53.764 --> 16:54.932
Oh, dear.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.603
Well. I think tonight's going swimmingly.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.523
Anyone for Parcheesi?

17:02.648 --> 17:05.567
-My head is spinning.
-Oh, Mrs. Hart...

17:06.109 --> 17:08.028
Did you hear that?
My wife's head is spinning.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.322
Generally speaking,
I don't like her head to do that.

17:12.574 --> 17:13.742
Time to improvise.

17:15.285 --> 17:18.413
You know, I'm beginning to think
you're not management material, Vision.

17:18.497 --> 17:20.123
You know, I had high hopes for you.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.836
But from what I've seen here tonight,
you can barely keep it together.

17:23.919 --> 17:26.922
I mean, look around. There's all this
chaos going on in your household.

17:28.173 --> 17:29.383
Now, when are we gonna eat?

17:29.466 --> 17:31.051
Dinner is served.

17:32.427 --> 17:33.428
VISION: Ah!

17:34.680 --> 17:36.265
Breakfast for dinner?

17:37.766 --> 17:38.767
How very...

17:38.851 --> 17:40.185
European.

17:41.270 --> 17:43.522
Ooh! Let's have a toast!

17:44.314 --> 17:47.484
To my lovely and talented wife.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.862
To our esteemed guests.

17:49.945 --> 17:51.321
Yes. <i>Cin cin.</i>

17:51.405 --> 17:52.406
Cheers.

17:54.783 --> 17:56.535
Well, please eat before it gets cold.

17:56.618 --> 17:58.495
-MRS. HART: Hmm?
-Oh, Mrs. Hart, allow me.

18:00.038 --> 18:02.416
So, where did you two move from?

18:03.041 --> 18:04.126
What brought you here?

18:04.209 --> 18:07.504
How long have you been married?
And why don't you have children yet?

18:11.466 --> 18:16.722
I think what my wife means to say
is that we moved from...

18:16.805 --> 18:18.515
Yes, we moved from...

18:19.933 --> 18:21.435
And we were married...

18:21.518 --> 18:24.229
Yes, yes, we were married in...

18:24.938 --> 18:28.358
Well? Moved from where? Married when?

18:28.483 --> 18:29.484
Now, patience, Arthur.

18:29.568 --> 18:31.778
They're setting up their story.
Let them tell it.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.363
We...

18:33.447 --> 18:35.240
Our story... (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

18:36.491 --> 18:38.577
Yes, what exactly is your story?

18:38.660 --> 18:40.537
Oh, just leave the poor kids alone.

18:41.496 --> 18:44.041
No, really, I mean,
I think it's a perfectly simple question.

18:44.791 --> 18:45.959
Honestly.

18:46.043 --> 18:47.252
Why did you come here?

18:48.754 --> 18:49.963
Why?

18:51.715 --> 18:53.550
Damn it, why? Why did you...

18:55.093 --> 18:56.261
(CHOKING)

18:58.472 --> 18:59.973
Oh, Arthur, stop it.

19:03.185 --> 19:05.354
Stop it. (CHUCKLES)

19:06.146 --> 19:07.231
Stop it.

19:07.314 --> 19:08.315
(CHOKING)

19:09.233 --> 19:12.319
-MRS. HART: Stop it. Stop it.
-(MR. HART CONTINUES CHOKING)

19:13.779 --> 19:15.739
Stop it. (CHUCKLES)

19:15.822 --> 19:17.199
Stop it.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.118
Stop it.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.245
Stop it.

19:21.453 --> 19:22.538
(GROANS)

19:23.497 --> 19:25.541
Stop it. Stop it.

19:25.624 --> 19:26.667
Stop it.

19:27.835 --> 19:28.836
Stop it.

19:28.919 --> 19:29.962
Vision, help him.

19:38.262 --> 19:39.888
(COUGHING)

19:44.977 --> 19:45.978
Let me help you up.

19:46.478 --> 19:47.479
Give me your hand.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.566
All right, steady on, sir.

19:52.109 --> 19:53.735
(GASPING)

19:55.279 --> 19:58.240
Well, would you look
at the time? (CHUCKLES)

19:58.365 --> 20:00.784
Yes. We'd better be going.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.162
Well... Are you both all right?

20:04.663 --> 20:07.332
We had such a lovely time.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.086
This guest is leaving your home.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.671
(LAUGHS)

20:12.754 --> 20:14.923
Yes, thank you for coming. (CHUCKLES)

20:15.591 --> 20:17.009
(SIGHS)

20:17.092 --> 20:18.552
You made me proud tonight, son.

20:18.635 --> 20:21.430
First thing Monday morning,
you and me are gonna have a little chat.

20:22.389 --> 20:24.641
We'll see about that promotion.

20:24.725 --> 20:25.893
Yes, sir! Thank you, sir!

20:28.562 --> 20:29.563
MR. HART: Thank you.

20:33.192 --> 20:34.318
Oh...

20:35.777 --> 20:37.905
What a charming door knocker.

20:39.448 --> 20:40.449
Good night!

20:45.162 --> 20:46.371
(BOTH EXHALE IN RELIEF)

20:47.706 --> 20:48.707
(SIGHS)

20:51.877 --> 20:53.962
We are an unusual couple, ya know?

20:54.046 --> 20:55.923
Oh, I don't think
that was ever in question.

20:56.423 --> 21:00.761
Well, what I mean is...
We don't have an anniversary.

21:00.844 --> 21:02.554
-Huh.
-Or a song.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.681
Or even wedding rings.

21:04.765 --> 21:06.141
Well, we could remedy that.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.310
Today could be our anniversary.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.979
Of what? Surviving our first dinner party?

21:11.063 --> 21:13.524
Precisely. And our song could be?

21:13.607 --> 21:14.900
<i>Yakety Yak, </i>naturally.

21:14.983 --> 21:15.984
-Naturally.
-Hmm.

21:17.653 --> 21:18.654
And the rings?

21:20.030 --> 21:21.532
Well, couldn't you make some for us?

21:29.706 --> 21:30.707
I do.

21:31.792 --> 21:32.793
Do you?

21:34.002 --> 21:36.213
Yes. I do.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.883
And they lived happily ever after.
