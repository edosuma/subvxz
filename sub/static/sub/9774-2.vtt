09:09.480 --> 09:11.005
I had a vision.

09:12.000 --> 09:15.288
A sign. Call it what you want. An epiphany.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.681
New York Dolls are a band, Richie,
not an epiphany.

09:17.760 --> 09:19.285
It's a band we passed on over a year ago.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.283
I'm not talking about the Dolls, per se.

09:21.360 --> 09:25.684

it smashes you over the head.

09:36.800 --> 09:38.962
You've already been smashed over the head.
That's the problem here.

09:39.160 --> 09:43.245
My skills... My skills, they've transcended
into the spiritual level, man.

09:43.320 --> 09:44.401
You don't understand.

09:44.520 --> 09:48.081
Okay, here's what I do understand, Richie.
I understand you're high.

- Right, and now we're selling it.
- RICHIE: No, we're not.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.206
I made commitments, Richie.

10:16.280 --> 10:19.409
Financial commitments with
serious ramifications for my whole family.

10:19.480 --> 10:22.768
I'm talking about our dreams
and you're worried about your mortgage?

10:22.840 --> 10:26.890
Yes, I am. I am, 'cause Chase Manhattan
doesn't give a fuck about dreams.

- Since when?

10:28.600 --> 10:30.204

We'll tighten our belts. It'll be okay.

I'm trying to be polite here.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.967
Yet you are rude beyond measure.

12:04.360 --> 12:07.091
Take a hike, you Nazi prick.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.889

No problems. It was very clear.

24:29.880 --> 24:33.407
Can you hum it?
Will you remember it tomorrow?

24:33.480 --> 24:35.926
Does it make you want to call the radio station

24:36.000 --> 24:39.004
and find out who the band
they just played was?

24:39.120 --> 24:42.761
