WEBVTT

00:45.838 --> 00:47.214
What do you want, Micah?

00:49.383 --> 00:50.843
I want this to stop.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.553
Then tell the truth.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.764
We don't have to be at odds.

00:56.723 --> 00:58.433
We loved each other once.

00:59.810 --> 01:01.353
And you inspired me.

01:02.563 --> 01:04.397
I'm willing to say that.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.234
That you were the inspiration
behind Discard.

01:08.402 --> 01:13.115
Rose, tell Poppy you were mistaken.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.199
Lie.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.119
That's what you mean, right? Lie.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.580
-Is it though?
-Yes.

01:19.663 --> 01:23.292
You've told the story so many times,
you might feel like it's your life,

01:23.375 --> 01:25.252
but it's not. It was mine.

01:25.335 --> 01:26.336
Not all of it.

01:27.004 --> 01:30.424
The attack in the club,
that didn't happen to you.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.800
It happened to me.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.970
You said he attacked you
because you were an outsider.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.264
He attacked me because I'm Black.

01:38.015 --> 01:42.227
-You can't erase that.
-That story was about vulnerability.

01:42.311 --> 01:44.521
Coming home from school and finding

01:44.605 --> 01:48.775
that your foster parents have moved
and left you behind.

01:48.859 --> 01:49.860
No warning.

01:50.444 --> 01:51.820
Whose story was that?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.030
-Rose, listen--
-Whose?

01:53.614 --> 01:56.241
Tell me the truth
if you can't tell yourself.

01:57.743 --> 02:01.663
The truth is bigger than both of us.

02:03.332 --> 02:05.918
I have thousands of girls who need me.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.544
You took advantage of me.

02:08.377 --> 02:09.755
Exploited Holt's devotion.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.757
-That's not true.
-It's not a lie.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.887
Holt's DNA changed
when he fell in love with you.

02:18.222 --> 02:20.474
Broken boy meets broken girl.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.519
Her jagged edges cut him to shreds.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.614
You remember that loft we squatted in
on Minna?

02:37.324 --> 02:38.992
Well, you can live a life there.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.289
It's yours.

02:45.123 --> 02:46.333
If I do what?

03:55.903 --> 03:57.112
Be careful.

03:57.196 --> 03:59.114
Okay, I'll be careful.

04:03.368 --> 04:05.746
-All right. Right about here.
-Okay.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.041
There?

04:09.124 --> 04:11.335
-Have faith. There we go.
-We got it?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.962
Yeah. I don't know if it's crooked or not.
Let me see.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.470
-That's nice.
-Yeah.

04:22.262 --> 04:28.477
James Baldwin once wrote
that to accept one's past, one's history,

04:29.394 --> 04:31.939
is not the same thing as drowning in it.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.150
It's learning how to use it.

04:35.234 --> 04:39.238
But an invented past can never be used.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.616
It cracks and crumbles
under the pressures of life

04:42.699 --> 04:45.994
like clay in a season of drought.

04:46.578 --> 04:50.874
The drought has officially begun
for Micah Keith.

04:50.958 --> 04:55.921
A seismic reckoning
for decades of deception.

04:56.004 --> 04:59.049
The question is, what happens now?

04:59.633 --> 05:03.679
Micah's deception
was emotional criminality.

05:04.304 --> 05:08.684
She took advantage
of the most vulnerable amongst us

05:09.351 --> 05:14.398
and exploited the pain for her own profit.

05:14.982 --> 05:19.278
And almost everyone she touched
has felt the repercussions.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.490
My own reckoning looms as well.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.159
For the choices I've made...

05:28.203 --> 05:30.539
the people I've hurt in the process.

05:37.713 --> 05:42.676
This story has forced me to be honest
about my own mistakes.

05:43.677 --> 05:45.012
My own reporting.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.015
I didn't set out to expose Micah.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.727
My only goal was to solve

05:51.810 --> 05:57.774
the murders of Joshua Keith
and his son, Drew Turney.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.906
All right.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.490
It's Rose.

06:07.993 --> 06:10.704
-Hello?
-The hospital discharged me.

06:10.787 --> 06:13.624
Don't leave. Don't leave.
I'll be right there.

06:16.502 --> 06:18.545
Why are you the one to get Rose?

06:19.254 --> 06:20.464
I don't have a choice.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.174
She doesn't have a place to go.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.676
Why do you need to see her so badly?

06:25.844 --> 06:28.430
I listened to my interview with her
last night,

06:28.514 --> 06:32.434
and she said Josh was threatened
because of his documentary.

06:32.518 --> 06:33.602
We knew that.

06:34.102 --> 06:37.314
-But how did she know that?
-I don't know. Maybe Josh told her.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.650
Maybe she knows more than she thinks.

06:39.733 --> 06:40.984
Is this about Micah?

06:41.068 --> 06:44.363
Why are you still protecting her
after the way she betrayed you?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.282
I want Micah held accountable.
I don't want her dead.

06:47.783 --> 06:48.784
Understood.

06:52.704 --> 06:55.123
Customer service can help
with any product returns.

06:55.207 --> 06:56.333
I'll transfer you now.

06:58.502 --> 07:00.796
You've reached Shelter.
How may we enhance you?

07:00.879 --> 07:03.257
Leave the phone off the hook.
What happened?

07:04.007 --> 07:07.261
When we got here this morning,
there were people out front. Angry people.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.056
-They pushed in, grabbing products.
-Take a deep breath.

07:11.139 --> 07:13.934
Okay, as long as no one was hurt,
it doesn't matter.

07:14.017 --> 07:15.185
Where's Ivy?

07:15.269 --> 07:17.312
She just finished up with the board.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.483
There was no board meeting on my calendar.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.778
Ivy asked me to remove it.

07:33.954 --> 07:34.955
I understand,

07:35.038 --> 07:38.125
but people are canceling subscriptions
by the thousands. Okay.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.502
Give me five minutes to handle this.
I'll meet you in your office.

07:40.586 --> 07:44.798
No, because Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's
both dropped the skin care line.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.717
I don't know. That's what I said.

07:48.594 --> 07:50.512
No, no, no. I need to call you back, okay?

08:04.651 --> 08:06.236
How do you want to play this?

08:08.488 --> 08:10.157
The board is moving to replace you.

08:11.033 --> 08:12.117
With who?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.453
The board approached me.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.295
You want to try to replace me
from my own company?

08:23.879 --> 08:25.297
You didn't leave me a choice.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.132
Okay.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.135
Let's test this out then.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.181
Let's see who people are more loyal to.
You or me.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.099
You know, this doesn't have to be a fight.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.020
It won't be.

08:52.324 --> 08:53.492
Sorry.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.212
Hey, Rose.

09:06.171 --> 09:07.589
I'm glad you called me.

09:07.673 --> 09:10.425
They needed my bed, so off I go.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.595
Well, I brought you a couple of things.

09:13.679 --> 09:17.683
Clothes, shoes, hygiene products,
a little money to get you started.

09:19.017 --> 09:20.227
Thank you.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.522
Can you help me
with a couple of questions?

09:25.274 --> 09:31.238
You said Josh was threatened
because of his documentary.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.073
What did you mean by that?

09:33.156 --> 09:37.494
I went to his screening a few months ago,
and I saw him get into an argument.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.371
The guy got in his face
and threatened to kill him.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.914
Did you get his name, by chance?

09:43.000 --> 09:45.294
But he looked like
one of those high-steppers.

09:46.503 --> 09:47.838
High-steppers?

09:57.139 --> 09:58.432
Any of these look familiar?

10:07.441 --> 10:09.735
That's him. That's him right there.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.489
Send that to Aames.
See if he knows who it is.

10:14.573 --> 10:17.201
-You sure he threatened Josh?
-Yeah, I saw him.

10:17.951 --> 10:19.203
He didn't see me.

10:21.455 --> 10:22.915
Micah was here.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.419
She offered me a place to live
for my silence.

10:28.504 --> 10:30.881
I'm not gonna lie about my life.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.925
It's the only thing I have. Good or bad.

10:33.717 --> 10:35.802
If you need a place to go, I can help you.

10:35.886 --> 10:37.012
How?

10:37.095 --> 10:39.348
My sister looked into
a couple of shelters.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.934
There's one in Albany, one in El Cerrito.

10:42.017 --> 10:44.937
I can take you to either one.
Help you get settled in.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.897
You can just wipe your hands of me?

10:47.731 --> 10:51.026
That's not my intention.
I just want to help.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.862
Both facilities are nice, clean.

10:57.491 --> 10:58.492
Where you going?

11:01.119 --> 11:03.664
Micah came here to shut me up.

11:04.331 --> 11:06.208
-You came here to use me.
-That's not true.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.210
Better off looking out for myself.

11:13.423 --> 11:15.050
Okay. I heard back from Aames.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.636
The guy Rose identified is Martin Haywood.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.014
And until a couple of weeks ago,
he was SFPD.

11:21.098 --> 11:22.391
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

11:22.474 --> 11:24.142
Aames wants to meet us in the morning.

11:24.726 --> 11:27.396
Okay. Follow up with him,
and I'll connect later.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.945
Hey, Daddy. It's me. I'm on my way.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.823
I want to share
the whole story about Miss Shirley.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.908
Not just what I told on the podcast.

11:45.497 --> 11:49.168
If your daddy really loved you,
he wouldn't be in jail.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.465
She never did things
that people could see.

11:56.300 --> 12:00.179
She made me feel unwanted, a burden.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.267
Then it was words.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.730
She was real good
at cutting me with those.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.774
The more she got to know me,

12:13.942 --> 12:17.821
the more creative she was
about what would hurt me.

12:19.114 --> 12:20.741
I had been there a month,

12:21.408 --> 12:24.578
waiting to hear from Daddy,
wondering why he hadn't written to me,

12:26.163 --> 12:27.956
when I saw a letter on the table.

12:30.083 --> 12:34.338
She wouldn't let me read it,
open it or touch it.

12:35.589 --> 12:39.510
I begged. I pleaded. I cried.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.679
She just laughed at me.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.392
It sat there for about a week.

12:50.812 --> 12:52.689
Finally grabbed it and ran.

12:54.483 --> 13:00.030
When she caught me,
I was screaming at the top of my lungs.

13:01.532 --> 13:04.993
Even though she wasn't touching me,
I just kept screaming.

13:07.246 --> 13:08.497
She...

13:09.498 --> 13:11.792
She grabbed it
and threw it in the fireplace.

13:13.544 --> 13:17.881
And as soon as the flames caught
the edges of that letter,

13:19.508 --> 13:21.134
I couldn't utter a sound.

13:22.177 --> 13:27.307
It was like it ripped my voice
right out of my chest.

13:28.559 --> 13:29.560
For good.

13:32.813 --> 13:34.940
I never spoke another word after that.

13:35.816 --> 13:39.069
What--
You've been holding this in all this time?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.280
Why didn't you say anything?

13:46.201 --> 13:48.453
Remember, you gotta stay strong.

13:52.708 --> 13:53.709
Don't cry.

13:55.544 --> 13:57.963
Nobody cares about
a little Black girl's tears.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.097
You did what you had to do to survive.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.517
I'm sorry.

14:12.603 --> 14:13.604
For what?

14:14.104 --> 14:16.273
All the times I diminished
what you went through.

14:16.356 --> 14:18.108
No, that's not your fault.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.570
Then whose fault is it?

14:22.070 --> 14:23.071
Daddy.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.075
I'll go talk to him.

14:42.674 --> 14:43.842
What are you doing here?

14:43.926 --> 14:48.388
Your father gave me his key,
but I decided to be respectable.

14:48.472 --> 14:52.351
-And you decided not to get shot.
-Yeah, that too.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.646
-Would you like a drink?
-Yes, please.

14:57.189 --> 14:58.190
Whiskey?

14:58.273 --> 15:01.443
The nectar of the gods. Sounds yummy.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.238
So?

15:05.489 --> 15:09.034
So, tell me something. Do you hate me?

15:12.454 --> 15:13.997
That's gotta be rhetorical.

15:17.876 --> 15:21.839
And I ask because you're about to
go on trial over your behavior

15:21.922 --> 15:24.508
as it pertains to the death of Owen Cave.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.802
A death that happened in that room.

15:29.137 --> 15:31.473
And now you tell the world
that you let someone else die.

15:31.557 --> 15:33.976
What do you want me to do?
It's out there now.

15:35.018 --> 15:39.106
There's a world where we lean
into Miss Shirley's abuse of you.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.691
Create sympathy.

15:41.316 --> 15:44.278
But we're gonna have to get in deep,
and I gotta know if you can do it.

15:46.697 --> 15:47.990
Do I have a choice?

15:50.117 --> 15:54.788
We all have choices,
but not if you want to keep the house.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.877
One of my neighbors wants to buy it.

16:01.003 --> 16:02.880
I've been shipping Ingram's things.

16:04.423 --> 16:05.966
This isn't home anymore.

16:07.467 --> 16:10.137
It hasn't been since Owen Cave...

16:12.055 --> 16:13.182
killed himself here.

16:16.310 --> 16:17.519
You've been through a lot.

16:17.603 --> 16:19.563
But you are a formidable woman.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.901
And you do a lot of good in the world,
even through your pain.

16:25.402 --> 16:26.403
That's worth something.

16:29.323 --> 16:32.284
Who the hell are you?

16:32.951 --> 16:34.828
Well, funny you ask.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.163
I-- Couple of years ago,

16:36.246 --> 16:38.999
I did some of those ancestry researches.

16:39.082 --> 16:44.004
I wanted to find out about my history.
Who's responsible for all this glory?

16:50.385 --> 16:54.765
Martin Haywood is a true believer
in the Sons of Ivar.

16:54.848 --> 16:59.228
I planted him undercover a few years back,
and the snake took to the swamp.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.231
I'm assuming this has to do with
why he's no longer with the force?

17:02.314 --> 17:04.983
-There's more than that. I fired him.
-Holy shit.

17:05.067 --> 17:07.486
Yeah. He was able to
play both sides for a while,

17:07.569 --> 17:08.779
but it caught up with him.

17:08.862 --> 17:12.782
He's been using an alias on Parler
to champion Ivar.

17:12.866 --> 17:15.953
He's even made some financial
contributions to the National Chapter.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.996
That's what got IA onto him.

17:18.789 --> 17:19.830
How'd that happen?

17:19.915 --> 17:21.333
Usual bullshit.

17:21.415 --> 17:25.087
Bitter divorce. The wife took the kids.
It's the same with a lot of these men.

17:25.170 --> 17:27.506
Yeah. He hated Josh
'cause Josh disavowed the Sons.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.091
So Haywood had motive.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.552
That's not enough for the DA.
It's a start.

17:31.635 --> 17:34.096
We need evidence or an eyewitness.

17:34.179 --> 17:37.474
Okay, just tell me this.
Do you think he could be our killer?

17:37.975 --> 17:40.477
It's hard to say. He's got an alibi.

17:40.561 --> 17:43.564
He was with SOI at an initiation ceremony

17:43.647 --> 17:45.691
the night that Joshua and Drew
were murdered.

17:45.774 --> 17:47.109
He's got sworn statements.

17:48.193 --> 17:49.486
Could be lying.

17:50.070 --> 17:52.114
You think you could find out
who was initiated

17:52.197 --> 17:53.949
or supposed to be initiated that night?

17:54.032 --> 17:55.409
That could be the road for us.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.995
You don't make off the books very easy,

17:59.079 --> 18:00.914
but I will see what I can do.

18:02.541 --> 18:04.334
You guys be careful, both of you.

18:04.835 --> 18:07.713
Haywood has come loose at the seams.
I don't trust him.

18:07.796 --> 18:12.009
So if he used police resources to cover
his tracks, maybe he left a trail.

18:14.094 --> 18:16.847
So, stick my head
all the way in the lion's mouth?

18:16.930 --> 18:18.432
Welcome to my life.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.228
-All right.
-Thank you, brother.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.365
How am I dating a cop?

18:36.325 --> 18:39.745
I mean, a fine cop,
but it's not usually my style.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.247
Top you off with another one?

18:42.331 --> 18:43.665
-Why not, right?
-Yeah.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.925
-Markus Killebrew.
-Desiree. What's happening?

18:55.552 --> 18:56.845
Markus.

18:56.929 --> 18:57.930
Hey.

18:58.514 --> 19:00.432
-I'm glad you're here.
-I got your message.

19:00.516 --> 19:01.892
Where the Capstones at?

19:06.396 --> 19:09.274
Elk. Fellas, what's happening? You--

19:16.198 --> 19:17.199
Drea?

19:25.832 --> 19:27.209
Sweetheart, are you okay?

19:27.292 --> 19:29.545
Nando, call the police and the paramedics.

19:31.046 --> 19:33.215
Desiree, can you take her outta here,
away from the eyes?

19:33.298 --> 19:36.927
Yeah. Could I get some officers
at The Knock? Shattuck Avenue and 54th.

19:37.010 --> 19:41.223
-Drea. Hi, I'm Desiree. This is Markus.
-Hey, sweetheart.

19:41.306 --> 19:42.724
We're friends with your mother.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.435
So, why don't we go upstairs
and wait for her

19:45.519 --> 19:47.479
while Markus tries to reach her? Okay?

19:48.355 --> 19:51.483
-It's okay.
-Come on, baby. It's okay. It's this way.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.669
Come holla at me outside.

20:27.144 --> 20:29.479
So this is the guy
who was supposed to be initiated

20:29.563 --> 20:30.939
the night of Josh's murder.

20:31.023 --> 20:33.358
Let's see
if he'll back up Haywood's alibi.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.577
Kyle Richter?

20:45.120 --> 20:48.415
My name's Poppy.
I'm a reporter working on a story.

20:48.999 --> 20:50.792
Was hoping you'd have a minute to talk.

20:52.002 --> 20:53.003
About?

20:53.712 --> 20:55.130
The Sons of Ivar.

20:57.549 --> 21:01.345
Nothing to say. I really don't have
anything to do with that group anymore.

21:03.347 --> 21:06.266
I'm sorry, is that an M40A5?

21:06.850 --> 21:09.728
Once upon a time in Texas,
I had a rat problem.

21:09.811 --> 21:12.898
That was the best way to deal with it.
And the most fun.

21:12.981 --> 21:15.442
What else have you got back there? Can I?

21:18.320 --> 21:20.364
This is a Marlin 336A

21:20.447 --> 21:22.950
and a Remington 540XR.

21:23.033 --> 21:24.034
Not bad.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.745
Is that your father?

21:27.329 --> 21:28.372
Military man?

21:30.249 --> 21:31.959
Saw his name on the mailbox.

21:32.876 --> 21:33.877
He's dead.

21:34.545 --> 21:35.838
I'm sorry.

21:35.921 --> 21:37.589
Yeah, that must've been hard.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.341
You should go.

21:40.592 --> 21:43.804
My dad was a Texas Ranger and military.
Vietnam.

21:44.930 --> 21:47.766
I can only imagine
what it must have been like as a guy.

21:49.768 --> 21:53.063
What happened the night of your initiation
with Martin Haywood?

21:56.066 --> 21:57.776
-Does he know you're here?
-No.

21:58.485 --> 22:00.237
And he never needs to know.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.614
What happened that night?

22:03.448 --> 22:06.535
Martin was a no-show.
He missed the whole thing.

22:15.294 --> 22:17.838
So Martin Haywood doesn't have an alibi.

22:17.921 --> 22:19.256
Nope. Lied.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.925
Have all the people at the initiation
to back it up.

22:23.093 --> 22:25.220
Just got an email blast from Shelter.

22:25.304 --> 22:29.683
Looks like your friend's
attempting to rise from the ashes.

22:29.766 --> 22:32.477
The accusations lodged against you have--

22:32.561 --> 22:36.815
Well, attacked the very core
of everything I've tried to accomplish

22:36.899 --> 22:38.233
and build here at Shelter.

22:39.484 --> 22:44.781
We are about empowerment,
female empowerment, from our inception.

22:45.282 --> 22:49.870
For another woman to be
the architect of this damaging campaign.

22:49.953 --> 22:54.082
And what's being lost in all this
is the work I do.

22:54.166 --> 22:57.794
I didn't ask for this position.
I wrote a book.

22:58.462 --> 23:00.547
And it struck a chord.

23:00.631 --> 23:01.715
It gave me a platform

23:01.798 --> 23:06.428
to be able to show others
how to turn adversity into strength.

23:06.512 --> 23:08.514
And I say it because I believe it.

23:10.265 --> 23:13.393
-What's next?
-Getting back to the core.

23:13.477 --> 23:18.524
Which is why I'm very much looking forward
to my weekend wellness seminar

23:18.607 --> 23:20.150
at Tilden Regional Park.

23:20.234 --> 23:23.779
Which I hope anyone watching
and everyone watching can make it.

23:40.671 --> 23:42.798
Baby? You ready?

23:42.881 --> 23:45.801
You know, traffic is a beast on the bridge
at this time of day,

23:45.884 --> 23:47.219
so we need to head out.

23:48.512 --> 23:49.805
I'm not going.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.977
I'm not trying to hear any of that,
Shreve. Now, let's go.

24:02.860 --> 24:04.152
I mean what I said.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.406
Elk told me where they found Drea

24:07.489 --> 24:09.992
and what they saw
when they went in there to pull her out.

24:11.326 --> 24:13.495
How could shit like this happen
in my neighborhood

24:13.579 --> 24:15.289
and I have no idea about it?

24:16.039 --> 24:19.126
Used to be nobody made a move
unless the Capstones gave a nod.

24:19.209 --> 24:21.628
This isn't your fault, Shreve.

24:21.712 --> 24:24.047
These appointments have been
nothing but distractions.

24:24.131 --> 24:27.718
Now, don't use that.
You know that's disrespectful.

24:29.553 --> 24:31.388
I'm not going. Ever.

24:33.849 --> 24:37.728
Baby, I know that you're upset
about being sick.

24:37.811 --> 24:41.190
But what you're really upset about
is Poppy

24:42.816 --> 24:44.484
and what she told the family.

24:47.070 --> 24:49.114
You two are so much alike.

24:50.490 --> 24:53.577
She's more like you
than the other two combined.

24:54.453 --> 24:59.958
Share your pain with her
so she can share hers with you.

25:06.173 --> 25:09.384
Martin Haywood.
Stop number two on our creepy man tour.

25:09.885 --> 25:13.805
Well, we've been scarier places
and interviewed scarier men.

25:14.348 --> 25:17.476
Yeah, but then we had
the might of the Times behind us. Now...

25:18.435 --> 25:21.939
I just wanna interview him.
Ask him some questions.

25:22.022 --> 25:25.442
Shit. All right, let's do it.

25:39.248 --> 25:42.334
Is Haywood running a meth lab back here?

25:55.472 --> 25:57.266
This place is giving me the creeps.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.600
Let's just-- Let's go.

26:00.602 --> 26:01.812
-Okay.
-Come on.

26:12.281 --> 26:14.700
What's he doing
with boxes of Shelter products?

26:16.410 --> 26:17.619
What?

26:42.936 --> 26:44.104
-Hi.
-Hey.

26:45.063 --> 26:47.149
This is not a good idea.

26:48.817 --> 26:49.943
Why not?

26:50.861 --> 26:52.821
Because it is dangerous.

26:52.905 --> 26:54.907
None of the attendees
have been fully vetted.

26:55.490 --> 26:57.034
These people love me.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.369
I called, and they came.

27:03.165 --> 27:05.501
You keep doing this,
you're going to destroy Shelter.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.055
Can I get your attention, everyone?

27:18.639 --> 27:20.390
-Hi. Welcome.
-Hi, Micah.

27:21.183 --> 27:24.019
So, we have a new speaker this evening,

27:25.020 --> 27:26.021
Ivy Abbott.

27:29.316 --> 27:31.360
And she's gonna start us off today.

27:33.237 --> 27:35.948
Go ahead. The floor is yours.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.953
Why don't you lead us
in the burning ceremony?

27:45.707 --> 27:48.877
That's a great idea.

27:49.878 --> 27:50.879
Thank you.

28:00.430 --> 28:04.268
If I can ask you to take out
whatever item you brought here today.

28:12.317 --> 28:15.988
A burning ceremony signifies...

28:18.073 --> 28:19.074
a cleanse.

28:23.537 --> 28:26.999
There is fire in renewal.

28:32.504 --> 28:37.926
Take a moment and think about
what your item represents to you.

28:39.261 --> 28:40.721
How is it holding you back?

28:41.889 --> 28:44.349
How does it represent your pain?

28:46.351 --> 28:47.644
Your limitations?

28:48.896 --> 28:51.940
Your failures and your disappointments?

28:53.400 --> 28:54.401
Close your eyes.

28:56.195 --> 28:57.946
Go ahead, close your eyes.

28:58.030 --> 28:59.823
I really want you to focus

28:59.907 --> 29:02.492
on whatever item it is
that you have in your hand.

29:03.869 --> 29:10.125
We all get trapped in unhealthy jobs,
relationships, lives.

29:10.626 --> 29:13.837
But we always, always have a choice.

29:15.797 --> 29:16.882
An inner strength.

29:16.965 --> 29:20.969
And that inner strength,
it burns inside of us just like this fire.

29:21.553 --> 29:25.933
All it needs is just a little--
little breath to ignite.

29:27.434 --> 29:29.645
Who would like to be the first to come up?

29:31.605 --> 29:33.190
We want Micah.

29:33.273 --> 29:35.275
Yeah, Micah. Micah.

29:37.611 --> 29:38.612
Right.

29:39.905 --> 29:41.323
Thank you, Ivy.

29:43.283 --> 29:44.326
Thank you.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.164
This is hate mail.

29:51.792 --> 29:52.793
All of it.

29:54.294 --> 29:55.629
Death threats,

29:56.755 --> 29:59.925
simply because I have the courage
to use my voice.

30:02.594 --> 30:04.346
It's time to release it all.

30:04.930 --> 30:05.931
Any...

30:08.183 --> 30:09.476
and everything...

30:11.603 --> 30:13.313
that holds us back.

30:37.504 --> 30:38.714
You remember my regular?

30:40.465 --> 30:42.342
Thanks for letting me come see you.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.596
I think about what happened
to you every day.

30:47.472 --> 30:50.517
Just replays in my mind.

30:51.310 --> 30:53.520
Mine too. But it's not your fault.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.155
You remember that young girl, Drea Spivey,
who went missing?

31:03.238 --> 31:04.489
Yeah.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.825
Yeah, well, the Capstones, they found her.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.037
And...

31:13.165 --> 31:14.791
it's fucking with me.

31:17.085 --> 31:18.587
What good am I doing, Pop?

31:18.670 --> 31:22.466
I mean, when I was on the force,
I had a purpose.

31:23.759 --> 31:27.679
It felt like I was doing good
for the world every day.

31:29.139 --> 31:30.349
But here I am...

31:31.683 --> 31:35.437
guarding some celebrity
while shit like this happens.

31:36.730 --> 31:39.691
Young girls like Drea getting exploited.

31:40.359 --> 31:44.363
-So you need to put your cape back on.
-Well, something like that.

31:46.573 --> 31:50.827
Well, since we are baring our souls...

31:54.164 --> 31:55.958
Ingram and I are getting a divorce.

32:00.420 --> 32:01.630
You knew?

32:05.425 --> 32:06.677
Zarina told me.

32:06.760 --> 32:08.303
-How does Zarina know?
-Micah.

32:10.514 --> 32:11.598
That's right.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.561
Well, I shouldn't be surprised, but...

32:17.271 --> 32:18.897
sorry I drew you into all of this.

32:20.566 --> 32:22.651
Please. I'm a grown-ass man.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.862
I could've said no.

32:25.737 --> 32:27.030
Did she ever fool you?

32:27.114 --> 32:29.116
No. No.

32:30.242 --> 32:32.160
But you see, I didn't trust Micah

32:32.244 --> 32:37.124
because her reactions never were
in line with the way I saw things.

32:37.708 --> 32:39.710
But I never suspected her of anything.

32:39.793 --> 32:42.129
I just wasn't buying
the bullshit she was selling.

32:48.135 --> 32:50.762
You know why
I've always felt a connection with you?

32:51.847 --> 32:58.353
Because you know what it's like
to be terrified to ever stop running.

33:00.063 --> 33:03.942
Because if you did,
that demon could catch you.

33:05.652 --> 33:07.946
Put you right back in that bottle.

33:10.699 --> 33:12.409
This goddamn lawsuit is...

33:14.703 --> 33:16.705
You know,
it's drying up my whole business.

33:17.706 --> 33:19.708
I'm obviously not working at Shelter.

33:20.667 --> 33:25.506
And the few security gigs I do have
pay for my men but not much else.

33:27.466 --> 33:32.137
Trini, she's going off to college.

33:32.221 --> 33:35.182
I got a new baby on the way.

33:36.934 --> 33:38.727
Markus, why don't you let me help you?

33:39.394 --> 33:41.396
Since I dragged you into all of this.

33:42.397 --> 33:46.485
I'll get at you if I need your help, okay?

33:47.110 --> 33:49.112
To help me find another job.

33:50.405 --> 33:54.284
So, talk to Micah lately?

33:54.368 --> 33:58.539
No, but I need to.

33:59.540 --> 34:00.916
So, what? You need some backup?

34:01.917 --> 34:05.587
And risk your wife beating me to death
with her tennis racket?

34:05.671 --> 34:06.672
No.

34:08.340 --> 34:10.007
Hormones and all that.

34:11.844 --> 34:12.969
That ain't hormones.

34:13.053 --> 34:16.306
That's "your ex-girlfriend gets
on my nerves" and all that.

34:27.234 --> 34:31.112
It'd be easier if I was a bad guy.

34:32.281 --> 34:33.322
A villain.

34:34.408 --> 34:36.493
Did I embellish my story?

34:38.911 --> 34:41.873
Yes. I did.

34:43.917 --> 34:49.672
Did I get more than 300 unhoused kids
off the street and into homes?

34:51.382 --> 34:55.596
Did I build housing in San Francisco,

34:55.679 --> 34:59.183
one of the most expensive cities
in the country,

35:00.184 --> 35:05.189
and put 80 unhoused families in homes?

35:06.273 --> 35:07.691
I betrayed my friend.

35:09.735 --> 35:12.946
I wasn't truthful
about all four corners of my heart.

35:13.030 --> 35:15.240
What woman is?

35:17.284 --> 35:18.577
But I loved my husband.

35:20.746 --> 35:23.332
I deeply loved him,
and I miss him every day.

35:23.415 --> 35:27.920
And somehow
that real loss is just forgotten.

35:28.003 --> 35:29.046
It's Poppy.

35:29.630 --> 35:31.215
Poppy Parnell.

35:31.298 --> 35:33.675
We're all imperfect humans.

35:33.759 --> 35:35.594
What's she doing here?

35:35.677 --> 35:37.513
That podcast on Micah.

35:37.596 --> 35:39.431
You're not welcome here.

35:40.182 --> 35:41.975
-It's okay.
-You should leave.

35:42.059 --> 35:43.268
It's okay.

35:51.944 --> 35:53.403
Did you come to join us?

35:53.487 --> 35:56.907
No. I came to make sure no one gets hurt.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.828
They're all here 'cause they wanna be.
I didn't force them.

36:01.912 --> 36:06.792
But you forced me to reveal one
of the most painful moments of my life.

36:06.875 --> 36:09.461
And my pain means what?

36:09.545 --> 36:10.921
I have no idea.

36:11.547 --> 36:14.341
Because I don't know
if you're capable of feeling anything.

36:17.386 --> 36:19.596
What makes you the judge of that?

36:20.597 --> 36:23.433
Did you team up with Martin Haywood
to kill Josh?

36:23.517 --> 36:24.643
Of course not.

36:25.978 --> 36:28.063
You don't have a single ally left.

36:28.772 --> 36:33.485
No one who knew you
before all this is left in your life.

36:35.445 --> 36:37.114
Where's the safety in that?

36:49.168 --> 36:50.252
Do you believe in me?

36:51.461 --> 36:52.754
Yes.

36:53.589 --> 36:56.133
-Do you believe in me?
-Yes.

36:56.216 --> 36:57.509
Thank you.

37:04.933 --> 37:07.436
-Do you believe in me?
-Yes.

37:11.481 --> 37:12.900
I believe in you, Micah.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.778
I believe in you.

37:16.862 --> 37:18.488
-I believe in you.
-I believe in you.

37:18.572 --> 37:20.324
-I believe in you.
-I believe in you.

37:24.995 --> 37:26.246
I believe in you, Micah.

37:56.235 --> 37:57.236
Hey, Daddy.

37:58.529 --> 38:01.490
Hey, baby girl. I'm glad you came.

38:03.367 --> 38:04.576
You ready to talk to me?

38:05.744 --> 38:08.080
I just didn't want to talk to myself.

38:11.291 --> 38:13.502
I hated every word that you had to say.

38:14.920 --> 38:18.048
I failed you. The girls.

38:19.675 --> 38:20.968
In so many ways.

38:21.051 --> 38:23.136
That's not why I told you any of that.

38:27.558 --> 38:32.020
Before she died, Miss Shirley told me
you weren't my father.

38:35.816 --> 38:38.485
One night she had been drinking,

38:38.569 --> 38:41.864
and I overheard her talking
with one of her callers.

38:44.825 --> 38:46.743
She caught me eavesdropping.

38:47.494 --> 38:52.833
And then she told me that Mama
was already pregnant when she met you.

39:04.970 --> 39:07.181
Do you believe I'm your father?

39:10.726 --> 39:12.227
Have I been your father?

39:16.315 --> 39:18.150
That's why you stopped talking, baby girl?

39:21.612 --> 39:22.613
Really?

39:27.284 --> 39:29.995
What was she to you? Miss Shirley?

39:30.829 --> 39:33.332
Just a woman I ran with
before I met Elinor.

39:34.082 --> 39:35.751
Took me a long time to realize

39:35.834 --> 39:38.545
that she loved me
like I loved your mother.

39:39.963 --> 39:42.132
She never forgave me when I left her.

39:44.259 --> 39:48.096
-That why she took all her rage out on me?
-She never showed that to me.

39:48.180 --> 39:49.473
Not once, ever.

39:50.015 --> 39:52.643
She was neighborhood.
She still came to the bar,

39:52.726 --> 39:55.562
the card parties
me and your mother used to throw.

39:55.646 --> 39:57.606
She only showed me one face.

39:57.689 --> 40:00.692
I never would've left you with her
if I knew anything else.

40:02.277 --> 40:03.737
Do you believe me?

40:07.491 --> 40:08.492
Look here.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.211
I've never seen this one
of you and Mama before.

40:20.462 --> 40:22.172
You look just like her.

40:22.256 --> 40:24.216
I love you so much, sweetheart.

40:24.299 --> 40:28.262
I'm so proud of you.
So goddamn proud of how strong you are

40:28.345 --> 40:30.264
and how you've made your own way.

40:32.850 --> 40:35.060
Your mother would be too,
but not surprised.

40:36.478 --> 40:39.147
She called you "Milky Way"
when you were a baby.

40:39.815 --> 40:40.816
She didn't.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.276
She did.

40:42.359 --> 40:46.655
Everybody thought the candy bar
or your pretty brown skin.

40:47.990 --> 40:51.034
It was because
you were her whole constellation.

40:51.118 --> 40:53.954
Her galaxy. Her little Milky Way.

40:54.037 --> 40:55.163
I never knew that.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.543
I used to tease her about it,
but I loved to hear it too.

41:04.631 --> 41:06.842
You are our daughter.

41:07.968 --> 41:11.430
You are Elinor's daughter.
You are my daughter.

41:17.477 --> 41:18.729
Yeah.

42:34.471 --> 42:36.515
Mitri, it's me.

42:36.598 --> 42:39.643
A late-night call.
I'm intrigued. What's happening?

42:40.727 --> 42:42.229
I don't want to go to trial.

42:42.896 --> 42:46.483
And I want to retire in Fiji.
What's wrong? You getting cold feet?

42:46.567 --> 42:47.609
No.

42:48.986 --> 42:50.237
Clarity.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.824
Settle the lawsuit.

42:53.907 --> 42:57.202
Meet the terms of Alana's demands in full.

42:57.286 --> 42:59.288
Were you smacked on the head again?

42:59.371 --> 43:00.664
I'm serious.

43:01.748 --> 43:06.044
Not everyone deserves
peace and closure, but...

43:08.088 --> 43:09.214
she does.

43:18.056 --> 43:20.893
-Poppy! You home?
-I'm in here.

43:32.529 --> 43:34.865
I told Mitri to settle the lawsuit.

43:36.533 --> 43:37.826
I'm selling the house.

43:45.000 --> 43:46.710
Well, where we going next?

43:47.503 --> 43:50.172
-You staying with me?
-Until I can't.

43:53.675 --> 43:55.427
How was your talk with Daddy?

43:56.428 --> 43:57.846
It was really nice.

43:59.431 --> 44:00.891
Well, I'm glad.

44:02.559 --> 44:04.811
Miss Shirley told me he wasn't my father.

44:05.395 --> 44:07.981
That Mama was already pregnant
when they met.

44:08.065 --> 44:09.274
What in all fuck?

44:10.484 --> 44:11.818
Well, what'd he say?

44:12.402 --> 44:13.654
That I was his daughter.

44:13.737 --> 44:14.738
Good.

44:14.821 --> 44:17.658
Running Mama name through the gutter
like that, "already pregnant."

44:21.119 --> 44:23.247
I bet Daddy stomped on that lie.

44:26.834 --> 44:28.919
Do you believe I'm your father?

44:35.551 --> 44:37.010
Where you going?

44:40.806 --> 44:42.015
Daddy?

44:49.773 --> 44:51.441
Daddy, you here?

45:26.768 --> 45:28.395
You stay the fuck back.

45:33.775 --> 45:37.279
It's time you stop
running your mouth on your podcast.

45:37.362 --> 45:39.364
tearing every one of us down.

45:39.448 --> 45:40.449
Now, if you don't...

45:41.408 --> 45:44.369
I can make sure that your father
goes to jail for the rest of his life.

45:44.453 --> 45:46.246
You can't make sure of shit,
'cause you ain't a cop anymore.

45:46.330 --> 45:47.706
And I said stay the fuck back!

45:50.167 --> 45:51.251
Hey.

45:52.461 --> 45:54.254
-Come on. Hey.
-Somebody help me!

45:54.338 --> 45:57.216
-Shut up.
-Somebody help me!

46:02.930 --> 46:05.015
Get your motherfucking hands
off my daughter.

46:22.199 --> 46:24.243
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

46:24.326 --> 46:25.327
It's all right. I'm here.

46:25.410 --> 46:27.621
They gonna send you back to jail,
and it's gonna be my fault.

46:27.704 --> 46:29.331
It's okay. It's okay.

46:29.414 --> 46:32.501
-He's dead, Daddy.
-Don't worry.

46:33.001 --> 46:36.004
-You can't go back to jail.
-I ain't going back anywhere.

46:36.713 --> 46:37.714
I promise.

46:39.049 --> 46:40.717
-It's okay. Come on.
-Okay.

46:41.677 --> 46:43.178
Come on, it's okay.

46:45.889 --> 46:46.890
It's okay.
