I just ran into Big Carmine
on the loading dock.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.625
You know, the guy
that can open a beer bottle

01:31.658 --> 01:33.259
with his belly button?

01:33.293 --> 01:36.897
Well, he told me that
it’s my duty as your best man

01:36.930 --> 01:39.499
to throw you a bachelor party.

01:39.533 --> 01:41.868
I had no idea!

01:41.902 --> 01:44.638
‐Would you like that?
‐I’d love a bachelor party.

01:44.671 --> 01:45.906
Is there gonna be any, uh

01:45.939 --> 01:48.341
bachelor‐type entertainment,
huh?

01:48.374 --> 01:49.676
[chuckles]
Huh?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.311
Oh.

01:51.344 --> 01:52.646
Huh?

01:52.679 --> 01:54.848
‐Aah!
‐Aah!

01:54.881 --> 01:56.550
Stop, stop it.

01:58.752 --> 02:00.486
What are we talking about?

02:03.389 --> 02:04.290
I’m talking
about the entertainment

02:04.324 --> 02:05.759
you have planned
for the bachelor party.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.394
Oh, oh, oh, that.

02:08.428 --> 02:11.464
Well, uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:11.497 --> 02:13.867
I thought we’d bob for onions.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.538
And then, uh, play a few rounds

02:17.571 --> 02:20.473
of pin the mustache
on Miss Mypos.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.509
Eh? Eh?

02:22.543 --> 02:25.411
And then I thought
we’d get down to the main event

02:25.445 --> 02:27.714
of the bachelor party.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.216
Team quilt making,
that’s right.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.452
That’s right.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.855
‐Hi, guys!
‐’Mary Anne, Jennifer!’

02:34.888 --> 02:37.824
What a surprise!
What are you doing here?

02:37.858 --> 02:39.292
Oh, uh, we came to pick up Larry

02:39.325 --> 02:40.694
to get measured
for his wedding ring.

02:40.727 --> 02:43.564
I’m going along, too,
even though I’m not engaged

02:43.597 --> 02:45.298
because it would be
a good experience

02:45.331 --> 02:47.968
in case I ever become engaged

02:48.001 --> 02:50.937
which is possible
because I’m still single

02:50.971 --> 02:53.507
and therefore eligible
to become engaged.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.944
Mary Anne.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.445
Yes, Balki?

03:01.481 --> 03:03.283
You have something on your chin.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.556
[Lydia laughing]

03:10.924 --> 03:12.593
Oh, oh. Ahem.

03:12.626 --> 03:15.328
Um, there’s, uh, a new, uh

03:15.361 --> 03:18.464
librarian in the Archives.

03:18.498 --> 03:20.233
He certainly knows
where everything is.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.871
So are you two ready
for the big day?

03:24.905 --> 03:26.540
Oh, yeah, we’re all set.

03:26.573 --> 03:28.909
[chuckles]
Then you’ve signed the papers?

03:28.942 --> 03:32.579
‐What papers?
‐The pre‐nuptial agreement.

03:32.613 --> 03:35.582
After all, your best earning
years are ahead of you.

03:35.616 --> 03:39.252
And someone with your talents
could make a lot of money

03:39.285 --> 03:42.589
and you don’t wanna lose it
all on a messy divorce.

03:42.623 --> 03:44.525
I wouldn’t even consider
asking Jennifer

03:44.558 --> 03:46.793
to sign a pre‐nuptial agreement.

03:46.827 --> 03:48.562
I was talking to Jennifer.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.733
We’ll have lunch.

03:56.369 --> 03:58.505
Oh, hi, Lydia.
The new librarian’s married.

04:03.977 --> 04:07.347
Jennifer, Mary Anne, guess what.
Guess what.

04:07.380 --> 04:10.717
I’m throwing a bachelor party
for Cousin Larry tonight!

04:10.751 --> 04:14.020
Oh‐ho‐ho‐ho! Ho‐ho‐ho!

04:14.054 --> 04:15.388
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

04:17.089 --> 04:19.358
Oh, okay, stop, stop it,
stop it, stop it.

04:19.392 --> 04:20.827
Larry, I can’t believe
you’re going to have

04:20.861 --> 04:23.296
one of those disgusting
bachelor parties.

04:23.329 --> 04:24.931
[laughing]

04:24.965 --> 04:27.668
Enough. Alright,
stop it, stop it.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.536
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Don’t...

04:29.570 --> 04:31.371
Jennifer, it’s not gonna
be anything like that.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.639
We’re‐we’re just
gonna get together

04:32.673 --> 04:34.575
a‐and, uh, make a quilt.

04:37.343 --> 04:39.012
Larry, give me a little credit.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.582
I know what goes on
at these things.

04:41.615 --> 04:44.350
A bachelor party nearly
destroyed my family.

04:44.384 --> 04:46.419
My Cousin April’s fiance
ran off with a stripper

04:46.452 --> 04:47.854
from his bachelor party.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.723
He gave up a thriving
dental practice

04:49.756 --> 04:52.826
to tell jokes at a place
called Benny’s Boom‐Boom Room.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.530
I love the Boom‐Boom Room.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.735
Oh, it’s a real classy place.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.738
They’ve got this thick carpeting
that cushions your fall

05:04.771 --> 05:06.507
if you slip off your barstool.

05:10.644 --> 05:11.912
I just don’t think
I could ever marry a man

05:11.945 --> 05:15.882
who would participate in such
a disgusting, degrading ritual.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.651
[laughs]

05:17.684 --> 05:20.420
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop! Stop it!

05:22.055 --> 05:25.759
J‐J‐Jennifer, Balki is
organizing the bachelor party.

05:25.792 --> 05:27.027
You have nothing to worry about.

05:27.060 --> 05:29.095
Oh, I hope not.

05:29.129 --> 05:31.932
Well, we better get going.
I‐I’ll see you after lunch.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.133

Myposian pre‐wedding snack.

Hey, Lar, lighten up.
It’s a bachelor party.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.837
It’s supposed to be loud.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.540

and I will send you home

is about to heat up.

‐Ah!

‐Tastes great.
‐Less filling.

Five bucks says
that Appleton can’t do two.

‐Ah!
‐Oh, ho, ho, I can do two!

Oh, it’s Jennifer.
Cousin, it’s for you.

Well, sure.

Okay, okay. Come on down.
See you in a few minutes.

12:14.300 --> 12:16.102

so I can try on my wedding band.

12:17.370 --> 12:18.371
Ow!

12:20.073 --> 12:23.409
If she sees this mess,
I’m a dead man.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.179
We have to clean
this place up now!

12:35.255 --> 12:39.359
Cousin, what should I do
with this punch?

12:39.392 --> 12:40.794
Throw it out.

12:47.834 --> 12:49.369
Here, give me a hand over here.

13:00.981 --> 13:02.148
There.

13:03.884 --> 13:05.385
Oh.

13:05.418 --> 13:07.387
Everything’s fine.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.833
That’s my arm.

I must have gotten this
last night.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.562
Wh‐where did we go last night?

13:48.595 --> 13:49.963
Did we go down to the wharf?

‐What did we do?
‐Don’t you remember?

is‐is‐is drinking punch

out of Bambi’s bra.

14:02.943 --> 14:04.578
That’s the last thing
I remember too.

14:06.079 --> 14:07.614
It was a double.

14:12.553 --> 14:15.055
Where do I come up with them?

14:16.623 --> 14:19.526
Balki, Jennifer will be here
any minute.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.128
And I have a‐a naked lady
tattooed on my arm.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.130
I have no reason
to go on living!

14:24.164 --> 14:26.332
[crying]

14:26.366 --> 14:28.101
It’s okay. I have everything
under control.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.272
I know what I have to do.
I’ll just cut off my arm.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.275
[grunts]

14:37.310 --> 14:40.581
Cousin, cousin, cousin, cousin,
you cannot cut off your arm.

14:42.949 --> 14:44.651
[growling]

14:46.653 --> 14:48.488
Why am I making myself crazy?

14:51.257 --> 14:53.359
I’ll just pull down my sleeve.

14:53.393 --> 14:54.460
[screaming]

14:54.494 --> 14:55.629
[knock on door]

14:57.297 --> 14:59.132
Balki, it’s Jennifer.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.935
If she sees my arm,
my life is over.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.136
[knock on door]

15:03.169 --> 15:05.105
No, it’s not, cousin.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.612
Why aren’t you helping me?

15:11.645 --> 15:14.380
Cousin, put your, put your
right arm in this, in the coat.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.582
Put our right arm
in the coat.

15:15.616 --> 15:16.583
Don’t put your left arm in.

15:16.617 --> 15:18.552
I’ll put my left arm in
right behind you.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.653
Now sit down.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.358
’Give me your hand.’

15:29.996 --> 15:31.231
Okay, here we go.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.633
[knock on door]

15:32.666 --> 15:33.667
Come in.

15:37.003 --> 15:38.304
Jennifer?

15:40.607 --> 15:43.076
‐Hi, Larry.
‐Hi.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.479
Oh, come in.
Uh, uh, sit down.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.284
Uh, gosh, I‐I‐I wished
I had known you’re coming.

15:51.317 --> 15:53.486
Uh, because, uh,
because, uh, well

15:53.520 --> 15:55.255
because, uh, of course,
I’m, I’m a mess.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.697
Well, I can’t wait for you
to try on your wedding ring.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.466
Oh, oh, uh, uh, uh...

16:06.499 --> 16:09.135
Uh, Jennifer, well, uh...

16:09.169 --> 16:11.271
You know...

16:11.304 --> 16:13.373
...trying on a wedding ring

16:13.406 --> 16:15.609
before the ceremony

16:15.642 --> 16:18.478
is bad luck.

16:18.512 --> 16:20.113
Bad luck, unh‐unh.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.049
No! No, no, no.

16:23.083 --> 16:24.184
A total no.

16:24.217 --> 16:26.286
[indistinct mumbling]

16:26.319 --> 16:27.554
(Balki)
’Ah!’

16:32.693 --> 16:35.195
Larry, that’s ridiculous.
Now give me your hand.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.563
Uh, uh, oh, oop.

16:36.597 --> 16:37.764
‐’Ah!’
‐Ooh.

16:37.798 --> 16:40.500
Uh, I just remembered.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.603
Ow!

16:42.636 --> 16:44.104
[groans]

16:45.672 --> 16:48.041
Uh, you know,
I‐I don’t think the, uh

16:48.074 --> 16:49.543
wedding band
will, will fit today

16:49.576 --> 16:51.277
uh, because, uh, because I’m...

16:51.311 --> 16:53.113
Uh, ooh, well, well, uh...

16:53.146 --> 16:55.115
[indistinct mumbling]

16:55.148 --> 16:58.184
Ooh! Because...

16:58.218 --> 17:00.253
...of water retention.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.055
Water retention.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.223
Yes, just... Oh, bloat! Bloat!
Look at that.

17:04.257 --> 17:05.290
Look at,
look at that, bloat.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.392
Look at that bloat.

17:06.425 --> 17:08.829
(Balki)
’Oh, ow, ow!’

17:08.862 --> 17:12.464
‐Larry, give me your hand.
‐Um, well, oh, oh, uh, okay.

17:13.767 --> 17:16.469
Well, I never realized
what long

17:16.502 --> 17:18.704
lovely slender fingers you have.

17:18.739 --> 17:20.840
Oh, oh, well, oh.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.742
Oh, oh, ha‐ha...

17:22.776 --> 17:25.078
[indistinct mumbling]

17:25.111 --> 17:26.613
[laughs]

17:26.646 --> 17:28.715
Actually, uh, I always thought

17:28.749 --> 17:31.618
your fingers were kind
of short and chubby.

17:33.754 --> 17:36.222
Well, I‐I, I would’ve
described them

17:36.256 --> 17:39.560
as, uh, strong and masculine.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.267
Well, I’ll say I always liked
your short, chubby fingers.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.402
I thought they were sexy.

17:49.435 --> 17:50.504
Well, you know, you know...

17:50.537 --> 17:51.738
[laughs]
Well, yes.

17:51.772 --> 17:53.439
I, but, I had no...

17:53.473 --> 17:54.808
Oh, I still have one of those!

17:54.841 --> 17:56.309
[laughs]

18:03.884 --> 18:06.452
The, uh, ahem,
this hand, uh, represents

18:06.486 --> 18:09.690
uh, my strong masculine side.

18:09.723 --> 18:10.757
[Balki groans]

18:12.893 --> 18:15.762
Well, whereas, uh, this hand,
uh, uh, represents

18:15.796 --> 18:18.865
my, my my soft wimpy side.

18:18.899 --> 18:20.166
Ouch!

18:20.200 --> 18:21.267
[Balki groaning]

18:21.301 --> 18:22.636
[screams]

18:25.338 --> 18:28.408
Well, it’s, uh
ahem, gas, gas!

18:28.441 --> 18:30.476
[grunting]

18:31.878 --> 18:33.413
Hoo‐hoo!

18:33.446 --> 18:34.515
Better.

18:34.548 --> 18:37.183
[panting]

18:37.217 --> 18:38.284
Ah! Woo‐hoo!

18:38.318 --> 18:39.586

18:41.487 --> 18:42.856
‐Larry.
‐Hmm?

18:42.889 --> 18:45.559
‐Why don’t we stop this?
‐Stop what?

18:45.592 --> 18:47.528
I know about the Bambi tattoo.

18:47.561 --> 18:48.695
[gasps]

18:50.764 --> 18:51.765
[gags]

18:53.266 --> 18:54.735
Do, you‐you‐you do?

18:54.768 --> 18:56.169
Yes, I do.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.939

18:58.972 --> 19:00.841
Darn, rats!

Woo! Hoo! Hoo!

19:12.285 --> 19:13.419
[chuckles]

19:14.721 --> 19:16.723
Balki, you can come out now.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.164
Oh, Jennifer,
how long have you been here?

19:30.270 --> 19:33.206
It’s a nice try,
but I know everything.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.876
Well, well, c‐could you
fill us in?

19:35.909 --> 19:38.979
[scoffs]
Well, at, uh, 2 o’clock
in the morning

19:39.012 --> 19:41.515
your friend Jimmy knocked
on my door looking for his car.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.584
Uh, he told me everything.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.686
Evidently, Gorpley tricked Balki

19:45.719 --> 19:47.854
into letting him take care
of the entertainment.

19:47.888 --> 19:50.591
So Gorpley hired Bambi
and he spiked the punch.

19:54.961 --> 19:55.962
Oh.

19:57.631 --> 19:59.966
Oh, w‐well, Jennifer,
Jennifer, I’m, uh...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.935
I’m gonna have to have
them change the tattoo.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.871
I’m‐I’m gonna make them add
an apron and, and write mom.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.475
Of course, I can never
go home again, but, but...

20:09.510 --> 20:12.646
That’s a small price to pay
for your forgiveness?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.515
Oh, Larry,
it isn’t a real tattoo.

20:14.548 --> 20:16.349
It comes off with baby oil.

20:16.382 --> 20:18.418
It’s one of Gorpley’s
little jokes.

20:18.451 --> 20:21.287
Oh, but‐but, y‐you forgive me?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.856
Of course, I forgive you.

20:27.628 --> 20:28.895
Now I‐I’ll tell you what.

20:28.929 --> 20:30.897
Why don’t you
just clean that tattoo off

20:30.931 --> 20:32.633
and then I think
you should come upstairs

20:32.666 --> 20:35.035
and apologize to Mary Anne?

20:35.068 --> 20:37.403
Last night, someone
from your party painted her dog.

20:47.013 --> 20:49.382
Balki, what are you doing?

20:50.751 --> 20:52.485
I’m sitting among the ashes.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.423
Well, I can see that

20:57.457 --> 20:59.492
but why are you sitting
among the ashes?

21:01.862 --> 21:03.296
Because I failed you.

21:04.798 --> 21:07.868
And because of me,
we drink a horrible alcohol.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.770
We break all the dishes and

21:09.803 --> 21:11.538
and I have a vague recollection

21:11.572 --> 21:14.374
of putting Mrs. Schleggelmilch
down the garbage chute.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.342
[sobs]

21:20.647 --> 21:23.850
I don’t deserve the honor
of being your best man.

21:23.884 --> 21:26.553
So with a heavy heart

21:26.587 --> 21:27.988
I’m stepping down.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.562
Balki, Balki,
come out of the ashes.

21:35.596 --> 21:37.764
‐No.
‐No, no, Balki.

21:37.798 --> 21:39.766
‐Come out of the ashes.
‐No.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.768
‐Come out of the ashes.
‐No.

21:41.802 --> 21:43.103
Uh, Balki, get out of the ashes!

21:43.136 --> 21:44.437
Wait.

21:46.372 --> 21:47.373
Balki.

21:48.474 --> 21:51.011
The, the day I marry Jennifer

21:51.044 --> 21:53.814
is gonna be the happiest day
of my life.

21:53.847 --> 21:55.582
And on the happiest day
of my life

21:55.616 --> 21:58.619
I want my best friend
standing next to me.

21:58.652 --> 22:00.386
Let’s give him a call.

22:03.123 --> 22:05.626
Balki, I couldn’t have
a better best man than you.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.630
‐Really?
‐Yes.

22:09.663 --> 22:11.598
I want you to be my best man.

22:12.766 --> 22:13.934
Then I accept.

22:15.636 --> 22:18.939
Now we are so happy,
we do the dance of joy!
