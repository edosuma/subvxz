WEBVTT

00:06.174 --> 00:08.576
*

00:27.261 --> 00:28.462
MAN:
Molly.

00:29.730 --> 00:31.732
It's okay, Molly.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.501
David sent us.

00:33.534 --> 00:34.735
We are federal agents,

00:34.768 --> 00:36.204
NCIS.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.172
The case is our jurisdiction.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.540
I'm Agent Sluhan,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.275
this is Agent Conlin.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.443
Are you all right?

00:42.476 --> 00:43.577
I... I don't know.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.678
I'm scared.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.779
David sent you?

00:45.813 --> 00:47.148
Yes, to make sure you

00:47.181 --> 00:48.249
and the evidence he gave you

00:48.282 --> 00:49.683
gets back to
D.C. safely.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.352
I know this
is hard, Molly,

00:51.385 --> 00:52.820
but trust me,
you're doing the right thing.

00:52.853 --> 00:53.854
You both are.

00:53.887 --> 00:55.556
I know.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.359
Is everything in there?

00:58.392 --> 01:01.195
Yes.

01:02.230 --> 01:04.198
I want to call David.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.299
Of course.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.367
But let's do it on the way.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.468
It's too dangerous here.

01:27.388 --> 01:29.857
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:29.890 --> 01:32.526
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:32.560 --> 01:35.129
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:35.163 --> 01:36.364
* How, how, how, how

01:36.397 --> 01:38.666
* Hey, hey

01:44.538 --> 01:45.839
* You gotta come on.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.543
LASALLE:
It ain't fair.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.245
You guys live closer.

01:51.279 --> 01:52.913
GREGORIO: Yeah, almost close
enough to hear the gunshots.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.282
You call NOPD?

01:54.315 --> 01:56.350
Nope. Tourist over there
sleeping off

01:56.384 --> 01:57.385
one too many hurricanes did.

01:57.418 --> 01:58.619
The attack woke him up.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.154
I'm assuming the
victims are Navy?

02:00.188 --> 02:01.289
Worse.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.157
Two of ours: NCIS.

02:03.191 --> 02:04.358
Say what?

02:04.392 --> 02:06.360
Agents Ed Sluhan
and Pete Conlin.

02:06.394 --> 02:07.695
You know them, Pride?

02:08.962 --> 02:10.598
No.
LASALLE:
Hey, isn't HQ

02:10.631 --> 02:13.167
supposed to notify us when
they send agents on our turf?

02:13.201 --> 02:17.205
Yeah, so things like this
don't happen.

02:17.238 --> 02:19.607
Conlin took two in the stomach,
but according to Doc,

02:19.640 --> 02:22.510
shots were aimed straight up
into his heart.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.345
Killer used his own
weapon against him?

02:24.378 --> 02:26.447
Agent Sluhan over here
never got a shot off.

02:26.480 --> 02:27.948
You want me to notify HQ?

02:27.981 --> 02:29.850
First, I want to know if
they were in New Orleans

02:29.883 --> 02:31.885
for business or pleasure.

02:31.919 --> 02:33.454
SONJA: Doesn't much look like
they were dressed for a party.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.888
WADE:
Well, if so,

02:34.922 --> 02:37.258
the party was over
for both of them instantly.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.760
And, in this one's case, grisly.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.829
Takes considerable strength
to be able

02:41.862 --> 02:44.332
to snap a person's neck
like this.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.637
He knew exactly
how to grab and twist

02:49.670 --> 02:51.239
so that some
of the vertebrae

02:51.272 --> 02:53.374
went directly
into his brain stem.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.475
Means a pro did this.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.476
SONJA:
Further indication

02:55.509 --> 02:56.844
they were here for business.

02:56.877 --> 02:58.679
The witness see anything?

02:58.712 --> 02:59.880
SONJA:
He said he saw them talking

02:59.913 --> 03:01.849
to a woman, then out of nowhere,

03:01.882 --> 03:04.318
Batman attacked.

03:04.352 --> 03:05.819
Come again?
Don't shoot the messenger.

03:05.853 --> 03:06.987
It's what he said.
No, it's true.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.456
They said the guy swooped in,

03:08.489 --> 03:10.324
took out
two agents like, like...

03:10.358 --> 03:11.859
a superhero movie stunt,

03:11.892 --> 03:13.861
then grabbed the woman
and disappeared.

03:13.894 --> 03:15.463
Disappeared

03:15.496 --> 03:17.331
He took her away?

03:17.365 --> 03:18.866
He kidnapped her?
WADE:
By force,

03:18.899 --> 03:20.401
if this is her crutch,

03:20.434 --> 03:21.602
as we expect it is.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.003
SONJA: The
prints we lifted,

03:23.036 --> 03:25.973
we sent them to Sebastian,
hoping for an ID.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.708
All right.

03:27.741 --> 03:30.010
Whoever this woman is,
she's key to figuring out

03:30.043 --> 03:31.545
why these two men were killed.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.746
Pull surveillance on the walk,

03:32.780 --> 03:35.883
get me the woman's ID ASAP,

03:35.916 --> 03:37.618
while I call HQ
and find out

03:37.651 --> 03:39.587
why the hell they didn't tell me
what these two agents

03:39.620 --> 03:42.690
were doing in town.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.957
SEBASTIAN:
Well, at least NCIS wasn't

03:43.991 --> 03:45.726
withholding anything from you.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.628
I mean, other than the fact
that the real Agents Sluhan

03:47.661 --> 03:49.497
and Conlin's badges
and credentials

03:49.530 --> 03:50.764
were stolen a couple weeks ago.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.900
Any idea why they were
impersonating agents?

03:52.933 --> 03:55.035
No, but at least now I know
who they really are...

03:55.068 --> 03:56.637
slash were.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.772
I matched prints
from the badges.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.909
Two ex-Army guys,
both dishonorably discharged

04:01.942 --> 04:03.944
for aggravated assault
seven years ago.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.414
What about since then?
That's the thing: nothing.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.915
It's like they just up
and disappeared.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.283
Up until last night.

04:09.317 --> 04:10.918
Before the superhero
killed them.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.520
SEBASTIAN: Yeah, which,
by the way, I just got to say:

04:12.553 --> 04:13.421
that's my favorite part
of the case.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.323
The fact that
a witness said that somebody

04:15.356 --> 04:16.524
"swooped in"?

04:16.557 --> 04:18.559
That's cool.
Be more cool

04:18.592 --> 04:20.794
if we knew who he really was,

04:20.828 --> 04:22.696
and why he swooped in at all.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.932
Yeah, we're not gonna get
anything off of surveillance.

04:24.965 --> 04:26.700
He, or-or they,
took out

04:26.734 --> 04:27.935
every camera on the Riverwalk

04:27.968 --> 04:29.437
about an hour before the attack.

04:29.470 --> 04:30.671
That's according to
the timestamp.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.340
Well, that means
either our superhero

04:32.373 --> 04:34.342
or our fake agents
didn't want to be spotted.

04:34.375 --> 04:35.976
Which also means it was
obviously a planned meet

04:36.009 --> 04:37.678
of some kind.
SONJA:
Yeah,

04:37.711 --> 04:39.613
but what kind of meet, and why?

04:39.647 --> 04:43.617
We got two mystery Army guys
meeting a mystery woman...

04:43.651 --> 04:45.018
And a mystery superhero
who killed both fake agents,

04:45.052 --> 04:46.754
and abducted her.

04:46.787 --> 04:48.422
He's the key.

04:48.456 --> 04:49.957
Actually, I think she's the key.

04:49.990 --> 04:52.326
Everything seems to center
around her, which means

04:52.360 --> 04:54.094
the sooner we can
figure out who she is...

04:54.127 --> 04:55.696
LASALLE:
Sorry, King, it's...

04:55.729 --> 04:57.865
this is about Cade,
I got to make this call.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.469
His brother okay?

05:01.502 --> 05:03.637
I think it's more a question
of who's gonna take care of Cade

05:03.671 --> 05:05.606
now that their
dad's passed.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.974
Did you get anything

05:07.007 --> 05:08.376
off the woman's crutch?

05:08.409 --> 05:10.378
Yes. Name is Molly Lindell,

05:10.411 --> 05:12.846
28, congressional aide
out of D.C.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.748
Apparently, she bought a
roundtrip ticket to New Orleans

05:14.782 --> 05:17.451
yesterday, scheduled
to go back tomorrow.

05:17.485 --> 05:18.752
Where'd she go after she landed?

05:18.786 --> 05:20.754
No idea. And credit
card records

05:20.788 --> 05:23.857
don't show any, uh, car
rentals or Ubers or hotels.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.894
I mean, there was no sign of
her until she got swooped.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.729
SONJA: Sounds like Molly
went out of her way

05:28.762 --> 05:30.431
to keep a low profile.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.600
To meet two people
who went out of their way

05:32.633 --> 05:34.768
to pretend
to be NCIS agents.

05:34.802 --> 05:37.471
She must have
some kind of a Navy connection.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.907
Learn everything you can
about Molly in D.C.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.842
Her job, her life,
everything.
Okay.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.911
You and Patton check
surveillance cameras

05:43.944 --> 05:45.679
from the airport
to the Riverwalk.

05:45.713 --> 05:48.882
Run facial recognition of both
Molly and the fake agents.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.584
Figure out where they were,
might help us figure out

05:50.618 --> 05:52.019
what they were doing
on the Riverwalk.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.887
What about the superhero?
Sebastian...

05:53.921 --> 05:55.122
I'm gonna find Molly. That's
a great idea, let's find Molly.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.824
LASALLE: That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.959
All right, listen to me,
my brother's not gonna rot

05:58.992 --> 06:00.828
in some loony
bin, okay?

06:00.861 --> 06:02.763
I don't care what my dad wanted.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.766
I'm the executor,
I'm making the decision.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.134
Cade's coming home
where he belongs.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.369
You got it?

06:12.640 --> 06:14.775
PATTON:
It doesn't make sense.

06:14.808 --> 06:17.545
Are you sure this Molly person
is just a congressional aide?

06:17.578 --> 06:18.912
Yeah. Why, you can't find her?

06:18.946 --> 06:21.148
Not after she landed
at the airport, no.

06:21.181 --> 06:22.883
Surveillance ain't everywhere,

06:22.916 --> 06:26.620
but she clearly did everything
she could to avoid being seen.

06:26.654 --> 06:28.055
Well, what about
the fake agents?

06:28.088 --> 06:29.957
Same thing with them
so far, too.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.693
Girl comes down from D.C.,
doesn't want to be seen,

06:32.726 --> 06:35.663
meet with the bad guys,
who also don't want to be seen.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.064
Yeah, and our superhero
swoops in,

06:37.097 --> 06:38.932
and-and saves
the damsel in distress.

06:38.966 --> 06:40.801
Or... take her away

06:40.834 --> 06:42.970
and do the same thing to her
he did to the fake agents.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.205
Yeah, you're right, he could be
a supervillain instead.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.040
That would be
super disappointing.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.809
Hey, I got a hit.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.679
There they are, driving
into the Riverwalk lot.

06:51.712 --> 06:53.814
Those are our
two fake agents.

06:53.847 --> 06:54.915
That's 30 minutes
before the attack,

06:54.948 --> 06:56.083
according to the timestamp.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.217
So when did
it leave?

06:57.250 --> 06:58.852
PATTON:
Let's find out.

06:58.886 --> 07:01.455
We should know soon as they roll
up to that camera.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.826
SEBASTIAN:
There. Stop.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.060
Okay, all right,
so who's driving?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.428
Rolling forward.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.199
Whoa.

07:12.232 --> 07:14.735
He hit that thing dead center
from a moving car?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.605
He's scary good,
whoever he is.

07:17.638 --> 07:20.073
Look, there's Molly.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.142
That's also 30 minutes
before the attack.

07:22.175 --> 07:23.811
PATTON: Leaving from the Omni,
which is only a couple

07:23.844 --> 07:25.779
of blocks from the walk.
Yeah. Okay, all right.

07:25.813 --> 07:27.581
Get a BOLO out on that car

07:27.615 --> 07:30.484
and I'll tell Pride
we got a lead on Molly.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.554
PRIDE:
Got it, Sebastian.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.722
We're almost at the hotel.
SEBASTIAN: Great.

07:34.755 --> 07:37.758
So Molly's listed
on the registry

07:37.791 --> 07:40.127
for a room at the Omni,

07:40.160 --> 07:45.599
but some company, G&M Holdings,
is paying for it, and that...

07:46.867 --> 07:49.002
Christopher.

07:49.036 --> 07:49.970
Yeah.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
Oh, sorry, King.

07:51.572 --> 07:52.873
What'd you say?

07:52.906 --> 07:55.208
Now, I... I know you got
a lot on your plate...

07:55.242 --> 07:56.910
Don't worry about me,
King. All right?

07:56.944 --> 07:58.145
I'm good.

07:58.178 --> 07:59.680
Focusing on the case.

07:59.713 --> 08:01.582
That's not
what I was gonna say.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.016
I know it's not easy

08:03.050 --> 08:04.084
when a parent dies,

08:04.117 --> 08:05.152
especially when you haven't had

08:05.185 --> 08:06.820
the best of relationships.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.121
Well, it's not so much that.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.624
I can't believe my
dad put my brother

08:10.658 --> 08:13.226
in that psychiatric hospital
for all those years.

08:13.260 --> 08:16.296
Cade's bipolar illness is pretty
severe, though, isn't it?

08:16.329 --> 08:18.298
Yeah, well, it might be less
severe if he was at home,

08:18.331 --> 08:20.634
with family, where he belongs.

08:20.668 --> 08:22.736
Still, all that matters
is he gets the best care, right?

08:22.770 --> 08:23.937
Absolutely.

08:26.674 --> 08:28.909
Hold on, you...

08:28.942 --> 08:31.612
you think I should leave him
at the hospital?

08:31.645 --> 08:32.913
Well, that's not
my decision,

08:32.946 --> 08:34.181
and certainly
none of my business.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.749
I'm just saying that...

08:35.783 --> 08:38.051
taking care
of people

08:38.085 --> 08:39.653
with mental challenges
can be challenging

08:39.687 --> 08:41.121
for the caregiver, too.

08:41.154 --> 08:42.890
And much as you
understandably want

08:42.923 --> 08:46.760
Cade at home, it might be
that he gets the best care

08:46.794 --> 08:50.664
from folks who know how to deal
with his specific problems.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.199
Either way, it's not

08:52.232 --> 08:53.734
an easy decision.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.569
I know that.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.939
Sorry, King.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.609
I know you had to go
through this before.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.343
Especially knowing
how close

09:03.376 --> 09:05.012
you were to your mom.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.982
Hardest thing I ever had to do.

09:22.863 --> 09:24.865
Federal agents!

09:36.043 --> 09:38.812
*

10:26.960 --> 10:28.896
Hey, what'd they say?

10:28.929 --> 10:31.131
No concussion,
thankfully.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.300
Got a thumping headache,
though-- not happy about it.

10:33.333 --> 10:34.868
You okay?

10:34.902 --> 10:36.770
Yeah, more or less.

10:36.804 --> 10:38.939
I've got my ass kicked
before, but never like that,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.741
and never that fast, either.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.744
Sebastian's superhero seems
to be all that and more.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.278
Yeah, still,
he's a killer.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.047
Had us dead to rights, too.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.816
Thankfully, whatever
happened to him

10:48.849 --> 10:49.917
happened when it did.
Yeah.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.284
Doc have a clue
what it was?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.886
No. They're gonna
run some tests

10:52.920 --> 10:54.154
after we have a word.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.789
Well, we got
a fingerprint match,

10:55.823 --> 10:56.990
for what it's worth,

10:57.024 --> 10:58.325
which I don't
think is much.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.027
Jack Cooper, 38.

11:00.060 --> 11:01.862
Car salesman
from St. Louis?

11:01.895 --> 11:04.364
Yeah, right.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.937
Sure it was just one guy?

11:11.438 --> 11:13.173
LASALLE: NCIS. Can we
have the room, please?

11:13.206 --> 11:14.742
NURSE:
Of course.

11:19.813 --> 11:20.981
LASALLE:
Where's Molly Lindell?

11:22.249 --> 11:24.885
Molly?
Cut the crap, Cooper.

11:24.918 --> 11:27.020
All right? Or whatever
your name really is.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.722
Look, we know you abducted her

11:28.756 --> 11:30.423
and killed those two men
last night.

11:30.457 --> 11:33.160
Tried to kill us, too.

11:33.193 --> 11:36.964
No, wait...
Wait, you don't understand.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.366
All right? I-I didn't know
who you guys were.

11:39.399 --> 11:40.367
I thought you were there
to hurt Molly.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.468
Excuse me?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.103
That's why I was there.

11:43.136 --> 11:44.237
All right? I knew

11:44.271 --> 11:45.839
whoever else was
after her

11:45.873 --> 11:47.307
was gonna look for her
in the hotel.

11:47.340 --> 11:48.776
I was just trying
to protect her.

11:48.809 --> 11:49.977
Hey, you're the one

11:50.010 --> 11:51.211
she needs protecting from.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.880
PRIDE:
Where is she, Jack?

11:52.913 --> 11:55.816
Where's Molly?
I don't know.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.250
I don't know where she is.

11:58.852 --> 11:59.953
LASALLE:
Geez Louise.

11:59.987 --> 12:02.089
Going that route, huh?

12:02.122 --> 12:03.924
Look, all I know

12:03.957 --> 12:05.826
is that Molly is in trouble,

12:05.859 --> 12:08.962
and that I have to
protect her. I swear.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.831
What, you're saying you were
there to save her

12:10.864 --> 12:12.232
Yeah.
Like, what,

12:12.265 --> 12:13.934
a good Samaritan
or a guardian angel?

12:13.967 --> 12:15.202
No, man, that's not
what I'm saying.

12:15.235 --> 12:16.503
Look, I don't know
how I know.

12:16.536 --> 12:19.239
I just-- I know that
Molly's in trouble.

12:19.272 --> 12:20.440
All right?
All right.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.243
Take a breath.

12:23.276 --> 12:26.113
Let's just say, for
the sake of argument,

12:26.146 --> 12:27.314
that we believe you.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.820
You must know
who's after Molly.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.555
Who those men were
last night.

12:39.459 --> 12:41.528
I can't remember.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.863
You don't remember,
'cause you're lying

12:42.896 --> 12:44.231
to us, and you know it.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.834
Look, man, I'm not lying, okay?
I'm telling you,

12:46.867 --> 12:49.369
I'm trying
to protect Molly.

12:49.402 --> 12:50.537
That's a bunch of bull.
Where is she?

12:50.570 --> 12:51.905
I don't know!

12:55.843 --> 12:57.077
I don't know where Molly is.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.556
LASALLE:
Guy's either a psychopath

13:09.589 --> 13:11.024
or an assassin or both.

13:11.058 --> 13:12.359
Maybe.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.261
Maybe not.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.296
You sure you didn't get
a concussion, King?

13:16.329 --> 13:18.231
I mean,
the man's a killer.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.333
Already killed
two other bad guys,

13:20.367 --> 13:23.136
who were probably
professional killers, too.

13:23.170 --> 13:26.206
I know.
There's a lot of questions.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.441
But one thing for sure is
they'll all get answered

13:28.475 --> 13:31.144
if we find Molly.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
Why don't you get back
to the squad room,

13:32.479 --> 13:34.915
see what the team's
dug up on the company

13:34.948 --> 13:36.083
that rented her hotel room?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.985
G&M Holdings.
Right.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.319
'Cause if we can figure out
what Molly was doing

13:39.352 --> 13:41.321
in New Orleans, we might
be able to figure out

13:41.354 --> 13:44.557
why the fake agents wanted
to meet her last night,

13:44.591 --> 13:46.526
and why Jack took her.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.595
Well, how do we know Jack
hasn't already killed her?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.197
We don't.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.999
But one way or the other,
we gotta find her.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.902
Go. I'll stay here,

13:54.935 --> 13:56.870
take another shot at Jack.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.072
Hopefully, the test
results will help us to...

13:59.106 --> 14:02.142
Learn things.

14:02.175 --> 14:05.278
GREGORIO: No way Jack
doesn't know where Molly is.

14:05.312 --> 14:08.148
NOPD got a hit on
our BOLO-- blue sedan

14:08.181 --> 14:10.217
abandoned under
the Claiborne Expressway.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.219
And Sebastian already
called from the lab.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.586
The fingerprints are a match

14:13.620 --> 14:15.622
for both Jack Cooper
and Molly Lindell.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.090
Which means if Molly
was in the car,

14:17.124 --> 14:19.159
he obviously knows
what he did with her.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.194
Yeah, I knew Jack was
lying through his teeth.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.096
I don't know
what King's thinking.

14:23.130 --> 14:25.966
All right, look,
Jack's not gonna help us

14:25.999 --> 14:27.234
find Molly, so we need
to figure out

14:27.267 --> 14:28.235
what this whole thing's about.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.636
Well, we may have
a lead

14:29.669 --> 14:31.371
with G&M Holdings.

14:31.404 --> 14:33.941
It's a multinational company
that's been providing

14:33.974 --> 14:36.476
everything from jet engines
to helicopter parts

14:36.509 --> 14:38.078
to the Navy for years.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.980
All right, so what's
the connection to Molly?

14:40.013 --> 14:41.915
I mean, why rent her
a hotel room

14:41.949 --> 14:43.450
and send her down here
from D.C.?

14:43.483 --> 14:45.986
Well, it might be more
about her boss. Show him.

14:46.019 --> 14:49.089
That's Molly standing
with Congressman Perez,

14:49.122 --> 14:51.258
who happens to chair
the oversight committee

14:51.291 --> 14:53.226
on defense spending.
And for the last nine months,

14:53.260 --> 14:56.129
the congressman has been
investigating the company

14:56.163 --> 14:58.265
for defense contractor fraud.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.467
Now, we're thinking
somebody from the company

15:00.500 --> 15:03.470
sent Molly down
from D.C. to expose it.

15:03.503 --> 15:06.039
This is David Finn.
He works in accounting

15:06.073 --> 15:07.540
for G&M Holdings.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.542
He's the one who actually paid
for Molly's hotel room.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.144
Could be Molly and Finn were
secretly working together

15:11.178 --> 15:13.346
to try to get
Congressman Perez

15:13.380 --> 15:14.614
to blow the whistle
on the company.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.616
And the company
figured it out

15:16.649 --> 15:19.286
and hired hit men to
come down and take Molly out.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.155
Still, why go through
all the trouble

15:22.189 --> 15:24.157
to pose as NCIS agents

15:24.191 --> 15:26.359
if all they're trying
to do is kill her?

15:26.393 --> 15:28.295
She might have had evidence
that they wanted,

15:28.328 --> 15:30.030
except Jack killed them

15:30.063 --> 15:32.199
before they could get
their hands on it.
Which would mean

15:32.232 --> 15:34.101
Jack really did save Molly.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.370
Ah...
If he did save her

15:37.404 --> 15:40.073
and is now protecting her,
why didn't he just tell us?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.642
I mean, it doesn't make
a lick of sense.

15:42.675 --> 15:45.045
All right, I'm gonna
fill Pride in.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.247
Maybe it'll help him
jog Jack's memory.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.649
Meanwhile, we need to
find David Finn, and fast,

15:49.682 --> 15:51.184
because if they're both
whistle-blowers,

15:51.218 --> 15:52.719
like you say they are,

15:52.752 --> 15:55.155
he's in as much danger
as Molly.
Okay.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.261
Patient/physician
confidentiality is

16:01.294 --> 16:03.630
a fundamental tenet
of medical ethics, Agent Pride.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.165
Which means unless
you have some--

16:05.198 --> 16:07.200
Public safety is an
overriding concern,

16:07.234 --> 16:09.469
Dr. Mangold,
trust me.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.104
The victim's life
is at stake,

16:11.138 --> 16:12.472
which means if
the test results

16:12.505 --> 16:14.307
can help me save
her in any way,

16:14.341 --> 16:15.975
I need to know.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.313
Well, I'm afraid
it's not good news.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.049
Mr. Cooper has
a brain tumor.

16:22.082 --> 16:23.450
Stage four, inoperable.

16:24.717 --> 16:27.754
Let me show you.

16:27.787 --> 16:30.457
Uh, right here.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.659
It's the red portion here.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.095
Deep in his parietal lobe,

16:35.128 --> 16:36.529
specifically the
supermarginal gyrus region.

16:36.563 --> 16:39.132
Sorry, Doc, afraid
you're gonna have to

16:39.166 --> 16:40.267
dumb it down for me.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.602
Okay, um, you
said he claims

16:42.635 --> 16:45.338
not to remember things--
recent events.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.574
This could explain that.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.042
Although, certain
real-world triggers

16:49.076 --> 16:50.510
can help him
remember things.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.412
And his sudden
fainting spell?

16:52.445 --> 16:54.347
Mm-hmm, this could
explain that, too.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.748
What else could it explain?

16:55.782 --> 16:58.518
What are you looking
for, in particular?

16:58.551 --> 17:01.388
I'm not sure, exactly.
It's just...

17:01.421 --> 17:03.290
He's a trained killer, Doctor.

17:03.323 --> 17:06.359
He kills without conscience.
Nearly killed me.

17:06.393 --> 17:11.398
And yet, when I was talking
to him in his hospital room

17:11.431 --> 17:13.533
an hour or so ago,
he seemed almost...

17:13.566 --> 17:14.801
MANGOLD:
Personable?

17:14.834 --> 17:16.803
Kind, even?

17:16.836 --> 17:20.240
Yeah. Yeah,
as a matter of fact.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.375
The area of the brain
his tumor is in

17:22.409 --> 17:23.710
allows a person the capacity

17:23.743 --> 17:26.279
to feel empathy
toward others-- or not.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.780
Meaning, as a tumor blocks

17:27.814 --> 17:31.418
certain memories-- say,
even of being a trained killer--

17:31.451 --> 17:34.187
it could also allow
suppressed feelings of empathy

17:34.221 --> 17:35.455
to suddenly reawaken.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.457
Wait, ar-are you saying
that he could

17:37.490 --> 17:40.693
wanna kill somebody
in cold blood,

17:40.727 --> 17:44.331
and then suddenly care
about the same person

17:44.364 --> 17:45.532
enough to want to save them?

17:45.565 --> 17:46.833
Theoretically, yes.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.435
The problem is,

17:48.468 --> 17:50.437
anything can trigger
either personality.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.306
And it can change
in the blink of an eye.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.175
How much time
does he have left?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.377
It's impossible to tell
or regulate.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.646
I mean, he could live
another year,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.281
or he could be gone tomorrow.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.183
All right.

18:04.651 --> 18:06.653
Thank you for your time.
Mm-hmm.

18:08.321 --> 18:10.890
Does Jack know?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.625
The severe headaches
alone would have

18:12.659 --> 18:13.760
sent him to
a doctor by now,

18:13.793 --> 18:15.362
so, yes, he has to know.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.897
Unless, of course,
he's forgotten.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.632
Yeah.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.782
I need your help, Jack,

18:35.815 --> 18:37.617
to find Molly.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.721
Would you help me
find her, Jack?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.292
Yeah.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.459
I'll try.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.262
Recognize them?

18:54.301 --> 18:55.835
The two men you
killed last night.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.737
Then you drove away
in their car.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.306
This car.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.374
Blue sedan.

19:01.408 --> 19:03.643
You drove it away
from the Riverwalk

19:03.676 --> 19:05.512
before abandoning it

19:05.545 --> 19:07.780
under the Claiborne
Expressway. You remember?

19:07.814 --> 19:09.249
Molly was with you.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.450
We found her prints,

19:10.483 --> 19:12.785
along with yours,
inside the sedan.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.521
Which means you took her

19:14.554 --> 19:17.657
before abandoning the car.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.792
Molly. If you really
want to help her,

19:19.826 --> 19:22.929
if you really want
to protect her, Jack...

19:22.962 --> 19:25.932
I need you to remember
where she is.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.773
There's a cabin.
Good. That's good, Jack.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.275
What cabin

19:35.308 --> 19:36.876
I had to protect her.
She's in danger.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.378
Yes, she is.
From who?

19:38.411 --> 19:40.280
Who do you have to
protect her from?

19:41.981 --> 19:43.316
I don't know.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.653
I can't remember.

19:46.686 --> 19:49.356
I just know somebody's
trying to kill her.

19:49.389 --> 19:50.557
Okay, well, let me
help you protect her.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.260
All right? Tell me
where the cabin is,

19:53.293 --> 19:54.761
where Molly is,
and I'll make sure

19:54.794 --> 19:56.529
that she's safe.
I can't remember!

20:03.270 --> 20:05.272
Make it quick, Gregorio.

20:05.305 --> 20:06.973
Pride, we found David Finn.
He's dead.

20:07.006 --> 20:08.908
PRIDE :
What
Neck snapped.

20:08.941 --> 20:10.677
Same as the fake agents
last night.

20:10.710 --> 20:12.412
Guess that's Jack's MO.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.547
Which means if Jack was hired
to kill Finn,

20:14.581 --> 20:16.749
he was hired
to kill Molly, too.

20:32.532 --> 20:34.867
PRIDE: Show them to
interrogation, Roy.

20:42.675 --> 20:43.910
Anything on Molly?
GREGORIO:
Yeah.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.512
Sebastian's still
going over the car,

20:45.545 --> 20:47.647
trying to find clues
to the cabin

20:47.680 --> 20:49.282
Jack said he took her to.

20:49.316 --> 20:50.983
LASALLE: And Miss Loretta's
doing an autopsy

20:51.017 --> 20:52.519
on David Finn's body

20:52.552 --> 20:53.953
to confirm whether or not
Jack killed him.

20:53.986 --> 20:54.954
Although, she already knows

20:54.987 --> 20:55.955
TOD was an hour or so

20:55.988 --> 20:57.390
before he took Molly.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.825
I don't think
there's any question

20:58.858 --> 21:01.294
that Jack killed Finn.

21:01.328 --> 21:03.296
The moment I told him about
you all finding the body,

21:03.330 --> 21:07.934
he suddenly wasn't interested
in helping us find Molly at all.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.736
Maybe I jogged his memory
too much.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.338
SONJA: Does he remember
anything else?

21:11.371 --> 21:12.672
Like where she is?

21:12.705 --> 21:14.574
Hoping to find that out.
But I wouldn't bank on it.

21:14.607 --> 21:15.842
We need to find her on our own.

21:15.875 --> 21:17.977
Hope she's still alive.
Only way she is

21:18.010 --> 21:19.479
is if she didn't give
Jack the evidence

21:19.512 --> 21:20.947
she got from G&M Holdings.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.549
Catch me up.
What do we know?

21:22.582 --> 21:23.950
LASALLE: We ran
the fake agents

21:23.983 --> 21:26.085
through every alphabet database.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.589
Found them linked to several
high-profile unsolved murders.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.824
Professional hit men?
Like Jack,

21:31.858 --> 21:33.426
who was on Interpol's
Top Ten Hit List.

21:33.460 --> 21:34.627
Seems he and the vics
were working together

21:34.661 --> 21:36.028
on a couple of targets.

21:36.062 --> 21:38.998
Yeah, looks like they're all
part of an elite hit squad.

21:39.031 --> 21:40.600
Special forces types,

21:40.633 --> 21:42.569
now murder-for-hire.

21:42.602 --> 21:43.836
No doubt hired
by G&M Holdings

21:43.870 --> 21:45.505
to shut up Finn and Molly.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.106
Turns out
Congress was looking

21:47.139 --> 21:50.009
into a hell of a lot more
than just fraud.

21:50.042 --> 21:53.112
Five chopper crashes and
three dead sailors in two years,

21:53.145 --> 21:54.781
all linked to faulty equipment

21:54.814 --> 21:56.916
sold by G&M Holdings
to the Navy.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.485
Except without
the evidence,

21:58.518 --> 22:00.653
we can't prove G&M
ordered the hits.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.889
All the more reason
to find Molly.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.023
Hope she still has it.

22:04.056 --> 22:05.492
I think it's possible.

22:05.525 --> 22:06.959
Jack could've
easily killed her

22:06.993 --> 22:07.994
at the Riverwalk.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.796
Instead, he killed his team.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.031
Which doesn't make sense if
they were all working together

22:12.064 --> 22:13.766
to take out both
Molly and Finn.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.835
Maybe he forgot he was supposed
to kill Molly.

22:15.868 --> 22:17.737
And thought he was supposed
to protect her instead?

22:17.770 --> 22:20.640
Maybe he remembered somebody
was trying to kill her,

22:20.673 --> 22:22.442
just forgot it was him.

22:22.475 --> 22:25.011
God, talk about Jekyll and Hyde.

22:25.044 --> 22:27.414
Still, Jack showed he cared
about Molly.

22:28.848 --> 22:31.117
At least long enough
to save her.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.389
Got to hope part of him
still does.

22:38.458 --> 22:40.993
I don't understand why King
keeps believing in this guy.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.830
Anybody else, he would've
thrown away the key by now.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.433
Well, I've never doubted Pride.
I'm not gonna start now.

22:46.466 --> 22:48.134
GREGORIO: Yeah, well, we
better find Molly fast

22:48.167 --> 22:50.737
because if Jack's hiding her
because she's in danger...

22:50.770 --> 22:53.573
Means he knows they're not the
only hit men looking for her.

23:04.951 --> 23:07.454
I'm okay, Jimmy.

23:11.824 --> 23:14.160
Where's the cabin, Jack?

23:14.193 --> 23:16.028
Cabin?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.797
What cabin?

23:17.830 --> 23:18.831
Where you took Molly.

23:18.865 --> 23:19.799
Look, let's not waste

23:19.832 --> 23:21.067
each other's time.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.569
Okay?

23:22.602 --> 23:24.170
Especially now
that I remember everything,

23:24.203 --> 23:26.806
thanks to you.
Except the problem is...

23:28.808 --> 23:31.511
...I got more time than you do.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.546
We all die someday.

23:33.580 --> 23:34.981
Exactly.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.816
Which means
every decision you make

23:36.849 --> 23:38.818
could be your last.

23:38.851 --> 23:42.221
Anyone ever tell you
your bedside manner sucks?

23:42.254 --> 23:43.990
Come on, Jack.

23:44.023 --> 23:45.825
We both know
that tumor in your head

23:45.858 --> 23:49.061
didn't suddenly turn you
into somebody you're not.

23:49.095 --> 23:51.130
You saved Molly.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.566
You tried to protect her.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.867
You don't know
what you're talking about.

23:54.901 --> 23:56.869
I'm talking
about you, Jack.

23:56.903 --> 23:59.706
Fact is, you saved Molly once.

23:59.739 --> 24:00.907
You can do it again.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.876
There's no saving her.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.579
All you need to do

24:06.613 --> 24:07.880
is help me find her

24:07.914 --> 24:09.649
before it's too late.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.884
For both of you.
It's a little late

24:11.918 --> 24:13.586
to make amends
for everything I've done.

24:13.620 --> 24:15.555
Not for Molly, it's not.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.958
Come on, Jack.

24:29.569 --> 24:31.738
You know, it's funny.

24:31.771 --> 24:35.207
My mama has the exact
opposite problem as you.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.510
She cares too much.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.278
Always has.

24:39.311 --> 24:42.515
Feels other people's
pain and suffering

24:42.549 --> 24:44.917
to the point
where it incapacitates her.

24:44.951 --> 24:47.554
She can't function.

24:50.156 --> 24:52.559
All in all,

24:52.592 --> 24:54.894
I'd rather be her than you.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.135
He's all yours.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.637
Get him out of here.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.005
You got it, Dwayne.

25:06.038 --> 25:07.640
LASALLE:
Nothing?

25:07.674 --> 25:09.642
No.

25:09.676 --> 25:12.044
What do you
want us to do?

25:12.078 --> 25:14.681
I want us to save Molly.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.651
SONJA: Hey, Doc,
you seen Sebastian around?

25:18.685 --> 25:20.019
He's not in the lab.

25:20.052 --> 25:21.020
Ah, he ran up
to Baton Rouge.

25:21.053 --> 25:22.922
Wanted to check his
findings with the USGS.

25:22.955 --> 25:24.657
That mean he might've found
the cabin?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.659
I think that's what he's
trying to figure out.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.928
He'll be back in a minute.
Well, did you find any clues
off of Finn?

25:28.961 --> 25:32.198
Well, he definitely was killed
in the same way

25:32.231 --> 25:34.333
as Jack Cooper's other victim.

25:34.366 --> 25:37.069
And precision's exquisite.

25:37.103 --> 25:40.039
Obviously, he's had
a lot of practice at this.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.340
Makes you wonder

25:41.373 --> 25:43.810
why Pride was trying
to appeal to him,

25:43.843 --> 25:45.011
what he thought
he saw in Jack.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.078
Dwayne sees

25:46.112 --> 25:47.680
a lot of things
in a lot of people

25:47.714 --> 25:49.616
that isn't always apparent.

25:49.649 --> 25:51.117
That's why he keeps trying
so hard

25:51.150 --> 25:53.820
to help others who can't
always help themselves.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.722
Sometimes
to a fault.

25:55.755 --> 25:58.758
Other times, at his expense.
Yeah,

25:58.791 --> 26:00.359
but a professional
hit man?

26:00.392 --> 26:02.294
Something tells me
you know why, Doc.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.130
Know him better
than anyone.

26:04.163 --> 26:05.832
Let me guess, something
about his father.

26:05.865 --> 26:07.033
No, actually,

26:07.066 --> 26:09.101
his mother.
His mother?

26:09.135 --> 26:11.103
I've never even heard him
mention his mother.
Me neither,

26:11.137 --> 26:12.905
except he said she
used to sing at his bar.

26:12.939 --> 26:14.106
Well,

26:14.140 --> 26:16.709
Pride likes to keep
to himself,

26:16.743 --> 26:20.747
and I am certainly in no place
to share, but...

26:22.181 --> 26:23.983
...he gets his love for music

26:24.016 --> 26:26.986
and his extraordinary ability
to take care of other people

26:27.019 --> 26:28.755
from her.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.624
Is she still alive?

26:31.658 --> 26:34.894
Yes. And he still takes care
of her, too.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.629
Well, color me surprised.
Mm-hmm.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.831
I think I know
where Jack took Molly.

26:43.235 --> 26:45.037
*

27:20.439 --> 27:22.308
What are you looking at?

27:22.341 --> 27:26.345
Just curious if you got
enough gas in this tank.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.080
What do you care?

27:52.839 --> 27:56.175
All right, good job.
Keep trying to narrow it down.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.476
Appreciate the call.
Sebastian found

27:57.509 --> 27:59.712
alluvial silt deposits
on the car

27:59.746 --> 28:01.948
unique to the Northshore
of Lake Pontchartrain.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.449
A lot of cabins
up there,

28:03.482 --> 28:06.485
so Gregorio and Percy
are heading over...

28:06.518 --> 28:08.220
What's the matter?

28:08.254 --> 28:10.356
NOPD just
called, King.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.390
They're on scene.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.092
Looks like
Jack Cooper

28:13.125 --> 28:14.861
took out all three marshals,

28:14.894 --> 28:17.063
then escaped
in their car.
What?

28:17.096 --> 28:19.031
Got to assume
he's going after Molly.

28:30.943 --> 28:33.179
(siren wailing,
indistinct radio chatter)

28:34.947 --> 28:37.216
Thanks, fellas.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.051
Hey, Jimmy.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.219
You all right?

28:40.252 --> 28:42.121
Yeah, I think so.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.423
It happened
so fast, Dwayne.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.025
I mean,
I still can't believe it.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.393
He took our car
like...

28:47.426 --> 28:48.494
I know.

28:48.527 --> 28:49.829
We got a BOLO out on it.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.130
Trying to track the GPS.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.999
LSP is sending helos, too.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.466
Might have a
general idea

28:54.500 --> 28:56.068
as to where he's headed.
Yeah, well,

28:56.102 --> 28:58.037
good luck trying to stop him
if you find him.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.072
I ain't never seen
anything like it.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.407
Before I knew what was
even happening, he was out

29:01.440 --> 29:02.842
of his cuffs and...

29:02.875 --> 29:04.977
took us out.
Been there, done that.

29:05.011 --> 29:07.146
BUXTON: Next thing I knew,
we're all lying in the middle

29:07.179 --> 29:09.415
of the damn road
and Cooper's driving off.

29:09.448 --> 29:11.350
Just be grateful
he didn't kill you.

29:11.383 --> 29:12.819
Yeah, tell me about it.

29:12.852 --> 29:14.420
He had every chance
to do it, too.

29:14.453 --> 29:16.889
He did, didn't he?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.793
Take care of him,
would you?

29:20.827 --> 29:23.262
Rest up, Jimmy. We'll do
everything we can to find him.

29:23.295 --> 29:25.297
All right? Promise.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.936
Gonna contact Gregorio
and Percy,

29:29.969 --> 29:32.071
let 'em know Jack's
coming to get Molly.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.073
I'm not so sure.

29:34.106 --> 29:36.208
What do you mean?

29:37.509 --> 29:39.378
Jimmy said it.

29:39.411 --> 29:42.214
Jack could've killed
all three of 'em, but he didn't.

29:42.248 --> 29:43.549
He chose not to.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.818
Could've been in a hurry
to go finish the job

29:45.852 --> 29:46.986
he was hired to do.

29:47.019 --> 29:49.521
Or maybe he was in a hurry

29:49.555 --> 29:52.959
to try and stop the other
hit men who are after Molly.

29:52.992 --> 29:55.161
King, he's a hit man.

29:55.194 --> 29:57.429
A hit man that's killed
three people already,

29:57.463 --> 29:59.598
nearly killed us,
took out three marshals.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.334
Why do you think he's not gonna
try and kill Molly, too?

30:02.368 --> 30:03.836
I don't know.

30:03.870 --> 30:05.604
Guess I'm just hoping,

30:05.637 --> 30:08.975
hoping maybe he heard me
after all.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.877
All right, go ahead.

30:10.910 --> 30:13.045
Call Gregorio and Percy.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.513
'Cause one way
or the other,

30:14.546 --> 30:16.282
someone's coming after Molly.

30:53.519 --> 30:55.354
Y'all get in touch
with Percy and Gregorio?

30:55.387 --> 30:57.023
We still can't get through.

30:57.056 --> 30:58.457
We've been trying
ever since you called us.

30:58.490 --> 31:00.326
We lost contact with them
about 15 minutes ago

31:00.359 --> 31:02.061
on the causeway
crossing the lake.

31:02.094 --> 31:04.096
I identified an area
of about six or seven cabins

31:04.130 --> 31:05.364
near the silt deposits,

31:05.397 --> 31:07.299
but we have no idea
how many they checked.

31:07.333 --> 31:09.435
Any luck tracking the GPS from
the marshal's car Jack stole?

31:09.468 --> 31:11.037
PATTON:
I've been trying,

31:11.070 --> 31:12.604
but if he's driving
under heavy tree cover

31:12.638 --> 31:15.107
like there is on the Northshore,

31:15.141 --> 31:16.642
the satellite signal
will be blocked.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.244
Uh, which Jack would know.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.246
Could be headed Gregorio
and Percy's way,

31:20.279 --> 31:21.948
and they wouldn't have any idea.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.082
Yeah, we didn't even
know that he escaped

31:23.115 --> 31:24.316
until after we talked to them.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.384
PATTON:
Got him.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.386
119 South Chenier.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.189
Looks like the marshals' car
is parked right out front.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.524
That's one of the cabins
I told Percy and Tammy to check.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.394
That means they could be
walking right into an ambush.

31:35.427 --> 31:38.998
Call LSP, St. Tammany Parish
Sheriff's Office. Let's go.

31:39.031 --> 31:42.268
But Pride, you're at least
30 minutes away from them...

31:48.307 --> 31:50.176
It's warm.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.144
The hit man might be inside.
Still no signal.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.612
What do you want to do?

31:53.645 --> 31:54.947
Not die young.

31:54.981 --> 31:57.049
Let's move.

32:01.353 --> 32:02.354
NCIS, freeze!

32:02.388 --> 32:03.589
SONJA:
Drop your weapon, now!

32:21.073 --> 32:22.641
Last chance, Cooper.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.376
Drop it,
or I drop you.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.445
I need you to understand.
I'm here to protect Molly.

32:26.478 --> 32:27.980
Oh, yeah?
Like you protected David Finn?

32:28.014 --> 32:29.715
David

32:29.748 --> 32:31.350
You gonna tell her,
or should we?

32:31.383 --> 32:34.586
We got to get her
out of here, fast.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.388
I know who they're sending.
You're not going anywhere.

32:36.422 --> 32:38.257
Think about it.
If I wanted to hurt her,

32:38.290 --> 32:40.259
why didn't I?
Because you need her evidence.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.228
I've got it right here.
He could've taken it.

32:42.261 --> 32:43.729
He doesn't need me anymore.

32:43.762 --> 32:45.131
Jack saved me from those men.

32:45.164 --> 32:46.532
He's trying to save me now, too.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.434
You have to believe him.

32:48.467 --> 32:50.069
We've got to get out
of here before...

32:51.370 --> 32:53.039
Get in!

32:54.540 --> 32:56.108
JACK:
Go! Go!

32:56.142 --> 32:58.144
Gregorio, in!

32:59.145 --> 33:00.746
JACK:
Go. Get in.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.214
Go, get in, go.

33:08.787 --> 33:10.589
Shut the door!

33:10.622 --> 33:13.092
Everybody okay, anybody hit?

33:13.125 --> 33:14.660
I'm good. Molly?

33:14.693 --> 33:16.595
What are we gonna do?

33:20.366 --> 33:22.368
Patton says he traced Gregorio's
car to the cabin, too,

33:22.401 --> 33:24.803
but the sheriffs are
still five minutes away.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.105
If the hit men
are already there,

33:26.138 --> 33:27.273
they won't last five minutes.

33:31.277 --> 33:32.611
What do you think?
Five, maybe six guys?

33:32.644 --> 33:35.081
I'm down to one mag. You?

33:35.114 --> 33:36.382
Already on my last.

33:40.152 --> 33:41.687
Stay with Molly.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.655
Where are you going?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.723
Going out there is suicide.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.437
Holy crap.

34:08.447 --> 34:10.416
I'm out.
Me, too.

34:31.870 --> 34:32.771
SONJA:
Jack's down.

34:42.248 --> 34:43.482
GREGORIO:
I got an idea.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.451
Follow me.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.136
Jack. Jack.

35:04.170 --> 35:05.437
JACK:
Molly.

35:05.471 --> 35:07.673
Got to protect Molly.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.408
Molly?

35:09.441 --> 35:11.277
She's safe. Molly's safe.

35:11.310 --> 35:12.611
You did good.

35:14.213 --> 35:16.114
JACK:
Got to protect her.

35:18.784 --> 35:20.686
Molly?

35:36.635 --> 35:40.306
LASALLE:
King.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.609
How's Jack? You talk
to the doctors yet?

35:43.642 --> 35:45.911
Jack died.

35:45.944 --> 35:49.548
About an hour ago, I guess.

35:50.816 --> 35:53.252
So what are you still
doing here?

35:53.285 --> 35:55.521
Just thinking.

35:55.554 --> 35:58.224
Wondering

35:58.257 --> 36:00.659
if Jack knew
he helped save Molly

36:00.692 --> 36:02.561
before he passed.

36:04.530 --> 36:08.634
I think he obviously knew
he wanted to.

36:11.837 --> 36:17.409
I got to admit, King, I didn't
see what you saw in him.

36:17.443 --> 36:21.280
I thought, after he
took out the marshals,

36:21.313 --> 36:25.551
he was going to kill
Molly, not save her.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.886
Her evidence pan out?

36:27.919 --> 36:31.557
AUSA I talked to says
he thinks it will.

36:31.590 --> 36:35.561
FBI is shutting down
G&M Holdings as we speak.

36:35.594 --> 36:37.696
Molly's a brave woman.

36:37.729 --> 36:42.768
She didn't have to do
the right thing, but she did.

36:42.801 --> 36:45.771
Thanks to Jack.

36:45.804 --> 36:47.706
:
Yeah.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.908
Thanks to Jack.

36:54.346 --> 36:56.715
Hey, King.

36:56.748 --> 36:59.385
What made you think
he'd do the right thing?

36:59.418 --> 37:01.620
Oh, I don't know.

37:01.653 --> 37:04.390
It might have been
more hoping than knowing.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.758
I don't know

37:06.792 --> 37:08.460
what made Jack become

37:08.494 --> 37:10.796
what he became
in the first place, but...

37:10.829 --> 37:13.399
you know me.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.535
I'm always looking for the good.

37:17.903 --> 37:20.339
Learn that from your mama,
did you?

37:20.372 --> 37:22.274
Sure as hell not from my father.

37:25.811 --> 37:28.680
I know you never met my mama,

37:28.714 --> 37:31.383
but she had her
own struggles.

37:32.584 --> 37:35.887
I tried to help her on my own.

37:35.921 --> 37:38.757
Eventually, I...

37:38.790 --> 37:40.826
had to find folks
who could figure out

37:40.859 --> 37:42.628
what she really needed.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.965
As soon as I realized
what was going on,

37:46.998 --> 37:50.369
I got her away from here.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.004
For her sake.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.776
Family.

38:28.874 --> 38:30.742
Hello?

38:30.776 --> 38:32.411
ARRIAGA :
Mr. Pride?

38:32.444 --> 38:33.812
Hey, there, Ms. Arriaga,
how are you?

38:33.845 --> 38:35.981
Good, thank you.
How is your morning?

38:36.014 --> 38:38.950
Oh, sorry, it's night
where you are, is it not?

38:38.984 --> 38:40.686
Yes, ma'am. My mama up?

38:40.719 --> 38:43.422
Yes, she is, she's right here.

38:43.455 --> 38:46.525
I'm putting the phone
on speaker, Mrs. Pride, okay?

38:46.558 --> 38:47.993
Here she is.

38:48.026 --> 38:48.994
Thank you.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.095
You're welcome.

38:50.128 --> 38:51.963
Hey, there, Mama,

38:51.997 --> 38:53.999
it's me, Dwayne.

38:54.032 --> 38:56.034
PRIDE'S MOM:
Who?

39:00.138 --> 39:01.807
Let's sing, Mama.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.168
Can you hear me, Mama?

39:30.201 --> 39:32.404
Come on.

39:45.551 --> 39:47.553
(piano playing same song
over phone)
