00:39.567 --> 00:43.833
* All around the water tank

00:43.833 --> 00:48.433

00:48.433 --> 00:52.567
* A thousand miles
away from home,

00:52.567 --> 00:57.367
* Sleeping in the rain

00:57.367 --> 01:01.300
* I walked up to a brakeman

01:01.300 --> 01:05.233
* To give him a line of talk

01:05.233 --> 01:09.567

You were always there for me.

04:01.833 --> 04:04.600
A true friend to the end.

04:06.733 --> 04:10.500
No words could sum up
the heartbreak I feel.

04:13.933 --> 04:18.533
I remember when I went to
the pet shop to get you.

04:21.067 --> 04:24.333
I liked another
kitten in the box.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.433
But you were crying

04:31.200 --> 04:33.933
and you wanted me.

companion all these years.

05:15.767 --> 05:16.633
What flavor?

05:16.633 --> 05:18.567
Mmm, chocolate.

05:20.100 --> 05:21.467
What's that supposed to mean?

05:21.467 --> 05:23.333
You know what it means.

05:24.700 --> 05:29.200
Can I get one single

No.

05:54.767 --> 05:56.100
Oh shit.

Hey mate, you got
something on your tire.

I'm leaving.

07:57.267 --> 07:59.067
I've had it with this place.

07:59.067 --> 08:00.267
Damnit to hell, Slug.

08:00.267 --> 08:02.533
It's time to grow up.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.333
I'm not like you, Dad.

08:04.333 --> 08:06.600
I don't want to be like you.

Stace, have you seen Ralph?

08:23.933 --> 08:25.700
No. Why?

08:25.700 --> 08:30.433
Because since Slug left
town, no one has seen him.

08:30.433 --> 08:33.067
Really?

08:33.067 --> 08:34.799

do without my Ralph.

I hope we find
him time, Stace.

she had an ice cream.

I bought this camera so
I could document when,

19:20.267 --> 19:23.400
well, if, she ever comes back.

19:23.400 --> 19:26.567
I thought we had
a real connection.

19:28.767 --> 19:31.633
I love you Katie George

19:31.633 --> 19:34.567
and I'm gonna make you mine.

19:36.433 --> 19:39.800
This is Warren, signing out.

19:41.667 --> 19:42.667
[Voiceover] I'll
never forgive Slug

19:42.667 --> 19:44.333
if anything happens to dad.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.467
[Voiceover] You
know what Slug's like.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.667
He's just a teenager.

19:48.667 --> 19:51.500
Yeah, but he's always
in and out of our lives,

19:51.500 --> 19:53.467
ruining everything.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.733
I've had it with him.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.467
Look.

19:59.467 --> 20:01.333
Dad.

20:01.333 --> 20:03.167
[Voiceover] Ralph!

20:04.200 --> 20:06.667
It's okay, doll.

20:08.433 --> 20:10.800
I'm sorry I left.

20:10.800 --> 20:14.567
After Slug went, I
just couldn't face you.

20:14.567 --> 20:17.467
[Voiceover] It's
okay, sweetheart.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.433
We can work through this.

20:20.433 --> 20:24.633
We are here for you.

20:29.000 --> 20:31.300
Come here, son.

20:32.467 --> 20:35.633
I love you, dad.

20:35.633 --> 20:38.733
I love you too, son.

20:42.633 --> 20:45.167
Okay, so, it's the
day after Katie George

20:45.167 --> 20:46.767
came into my life.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.500
It's a beautiful day outside.

20:49.500 --> 20:51.067
Good day for ice cream.

20:51.067 --> 20:53.467
I hope she comes back.

20:53.467 --> 20:55.633
We've got so much to talk about.

20:55.633 --> 20:59.333
Last night's show was
a genuine cliffhanger.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.767
I want to tell her
how good she was.

21:02.767 --> 21:05.800
She probably gets
that all the time.

21:05.800 --> 21:10.800
You know, Katie's a lot
like Stacey in real life.

21:11.167 --> 21:12.700
They're both beautiful.

21:12.700 --> 21:14.933
They're both friendly.

21:14.933 --> 21:18.800
I'd really love to
talk to her again.

21:18.800 --> 21:22.333
I've got so many questions
I want to ask her.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.633
Like, what's her favorite food?

21:24.633 --> 21:26.533
Her favorite movies?

21:26.533 --> 21:28.933
Does she like Clint Eastwood?

21:30.333 --> 21:33.233
Does she have a boyfriend?

21:33.233 --> 21:36.700
Anyway, I better be off now.

21:38.167 --> 21:40.467
Fingers crossed.

21:43.600 --> 21:44.800
You want an ice
cream, sweetie?

21:44.800 --> 21:46.667
Yeah.

21:46.667 --> 21:48.867
What kind do you want?

21:48.867 --> 21:51.300
Um, strawberry.

21:51.300 --> 21:52.267
Okay.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.700
Um, hi.

21:53.700 --> 21:58.200
Can I get a one scoop cone
of strawberry, thanks?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.533
Cone?

22:02.900 --> 22:04.900
When are we meeting dad?

22:04.900 --> 22:07.933
We're gonna go and
see him now, sweetie.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.367
That's $2.90.

22:18.067 --> 22:18.933
Warren?

22:18.933 --> 22:20.367
Yeah?

22:20.367 --> 22:23.067
Warren Thompson?

22:24.133 --> 22:26.800
Amanda.

22:26.800 --> 22:28.733
Yeah.

22:28.733 --> 22:31.400
Long time, no see, eh?

22:31.400 --> 22:32.767
Yeah.

22:32.767 --> 22:34.767
[Amanda] So, how ya been?

22:34.767 --> 22:36.667
Not bad.

22:36.667 --> 22:38.500
Yourself?

22:38.500 --> 22:41.267
Busy.

22:41.267 --> 22:43.400
So, you got kids?

22:43.400 --> 22:45.433
No.

22:45.433 --> 22:47.233
Married?

22:47.233 --> 22:49.433
No.

22:50.467 --> 22:53.867
Just been busy working, eh?

22:53.867 --> 22:56.767
Pretty much.

22:56.767 --> 22:58.700
Who's that.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.433
This is Warren.

23:00.433 --> 23:03.567
Warren and I used
to be good friends.

23:03.567 --> 23:06.067
Was he your boyfriend?

23:06.067 --> 23:08.067
Sorry.

23:08.067 --> 23:10.233
It's okay.

23:12.800 --> 23:16.200
Well, we better get going.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.733
It was nice seeing you.

23:19.733 --> 23:21.933
Yeah, same.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.567
Stay safe.

23:23.567 --> 23:25.600
Yeah, you too.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.533
See ya.

23:26.533 --> 23:37.200
Bye.

23:41.800 --> 23:43.133
Hey.

23:44.333 --> 23:46.800
Sorry, I didn't see ya there.

23:46.800 --> 23:48.500
How can I help you?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.400
Single scoop of vanilla.

23:50.400 --> 23:55.900
Okay.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.567
That's $2.90.

24:02.567 --> 24:11.067
With nuts.

24:15.600 --> 24:17.733
$3.70.

24:21.067 --> 24:39.667
Hey.

24:43.633 --> 24:47.600
I waited until 10
o'clock for her to come.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.633
But she didn't come.

24:49.633 --> 24:51.933
Maybe she was too busy.

24:51.933 --> 24:54.433
Or maybe she was in filming.

24:54.433 --> 24:57.467
She said that she
liked my ice cream.

24:57.467 --> 25:02.233
So, I think she'll come back.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.933
My van's getting
serviced tomorrow.

25:08.933 --> 25:11.233
So I might go and walk around

25:11.233 --> 25:14.133
and see if I can find
where they're filming.

25:15.433 --> 25:17.967
I could even take some
honeycomb ice cream

25:17.967 --> 25:20.067
on to set for her.

25:20.067 --> 25:23.267
I think she'd like that.

25:23.267 --> 25:27.067
Then maybe she might
start to see me

25:27.067 --> 25:30.267
like I see her.

25:34.733 --> 25:36.333
Hey, Warren.

25:36.333 --> 25:37.267
Warren.

25:37.267 --> 25:38.500
Hey, Dylan.

25:38.500 --> 25:40.067
[Dylan] Bye, Warren.

25:40.067 --> 25:42.133
See you later, mate.

25:42.133 --> 25:51.567
(Where Did You Sleep
Last Night by Lead Belly)

25:55.900 --> 25:59.100
* My girl, my girl

25:59.100 --> 26:02.600
* Don't lie to me.

26:02.600 --> 26:04.067
* Tell me where

26:04.067 --> 26:06.667
* Did you sleep last night

26:06.667 --> 26:08.767
* Come on and tell me, baby

26:08.767 --> 26:11.667
* In the pines, in the pines

26:11.667 --> 26:14.867
* Where the sun don't ever shine

26:14.867 --> 26:19.567
* I would shiver the
whole night through

26:21.267 --> 26:24.433
* My girl, my girl

26:24.433 --> 26:27.533
* Where will you go

26:27.533 --> 26:32.467
* I'm going where
the cold wind blows

26:33.767 --> 26:36.967
* In the pines, in the pines

26:36.967 --> 26:40.067
* Where the sun don't ever shine

26:40.067 --> 26:44.700
* I would shiver the
whole night through *

26:46.467 --> 26:48.167
Man, I hate school.

26:48.167 --> 26:50.467
Same, man.

26:54.933 --> 26:56.733
Hey, Limpy.

26:56.733 --> 26:58.167
Excuse me?

26:58.167 --> 26:59.800
What's going on?

27:01.600 --> 27:03.600
Hey, Limpy Pete

27:03.600 --> 27:05.300
My name's Warren.

27:05.300 --> 27:07.067
Warren.

27:08.067 --> 27:10.400
Warren the wanker.

27:10.400 --> 27:15.400
* My husband was a
hardworking man *

27:18.133 --> 27:19.733
Excuse me.

27:19.733 --> 27:21.067
Hey.

27:21.067 --> 27:22.367
Excuse me?

27:22.367 --> 27:23.300
Yeah?

27:23.300 --> 27:24.933
Is that your son?

27:24.933 --> 27:25.867
Yeah.

27:25.867 --> 27:27.133
He stole from me.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.300
What?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.233
I run an ice cream
van and yesterday

27:30.233 --> 27:31.800
he stole from me.

27:31.800 --> 27:32.500
Really?

27:32.500 --> 27:33.700
[Warren] Yeah.

27:33.700 --> 27:35.367
What do you want
me to do about it?

27:35.367 --> 27:36.433
I don't know.

27:36.433 --> 27:37.367
Pay for it.

27:37.367 --> 27:39.267
Piss off, mate.

27:39.267 --> 27:40.067
Come on.

27:40.067 --> 27:42.500
Don't fucking touch me.

27:42.500 --> 27:43.867
Now back off.

27:43.867 --> 27:46.067
You owe me $3.70.

27:46.067 --> 27:47.500
Single scoop with nuts.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.700
$3.70.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.633
Bash him, mom.

27:49.633 --> 27:51.100
Shut up, you little shit.

27:51.100 --> 27:53.833
Now listen, just
fuck off, alright?

27:53.833 --> 27:55.967
The police are
gonna hear about this.

27:55.967 --> 27:57.133
Whatever the fuck.

27:57.133 --> 27:59.300
Just fuck off, retard.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.400
Come on.

28:05.500 --> 28:10.500
(sad music)

28:11.467 --> 28:14.500
I walked around all day.

28:14.500 --> 28:17.367
No sign of anyone filming.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.533
No sign of Katie.

28:21.500 --> 28:25.367
They must have been
filming somewhere else.

28:25.367 --> 28:29.467
I didn't really have any
proper friends at high school.

28:31.100 --> 28:33.567
There was Matty Harrison.

28:33.567 --> 28:37.633
But he moved to
Sydney in year 9.

28:38.600 --> 28:41.567
Kids used to make
fun of my walk.

28:43.300 --> 28:45.900
Kids can be cruel.

28:47.233 --> 28:50.467
But, they don't know any better.

28:50.467 --> 28:53.433
I've never been in a fight.

28:53.433 --> 28:56.367
Not a proper one, anyway.

28:56.367 --> 28:58.067
I was always getting picked on

28:58.067 --> 29:00.333
by a bully at school.

29:00.333 --> 29:03.233
He used to kick
the footy into me.

29:06.800 --> 29:10.233
One day he picked up my bag,

29:11.300 --> 29:14.667
And emptied it all
over the ground.

29:14.667 --> 29:17.133
And everyone was laughing.

29:18.067 --> 29:22.133
Back then, I used to use
a stick to walk with.

29:23.800 --> 29:26.067
And when his back was turned,

29:27.067 --> 29:29.733
I hit him with it.

29:29.733 --> 29:32.067
And he fell to the ground.

29:32.067 --> 29:34.900
And I kept hitting him.

29:34.900 --> 29:37.333
I wouldn't stop.

29:39.167 --> 29:43.433
He wasn't the only
kid that picked on me.

29:43.433 --> 29:46.167
Probably not even the worst.

29:47.067 --> 29:50.700
But I took it all out on him.

29:53.500 --> 29:57.600
It's always been hard to
me to find a girlfriend.

29:58.833 --> 30:01.533
I've had a few over the years.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.967
My first girlfriend was Kelly.

30:10.767 --> 30:13.100
And that's me.

30:14.000 --> 30:16.367
We lived on the same street

30:16.367 --> 30:19.967
and our parents used
to hang out together.

30:19.967 --> 30:22.900
We had our first kiss
at her mom's 30th.

30:22.900 --> 30:24.633
Then there was Lauren.

30:24.633 --> 30:28.300
We got together at a party
after our high school formal.

30:28.300 --> 30:31.100
Everyone was really drunk,

30:31.100 --> 30:35.400
and her boyfriend was
pashing on with Jess.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.733
So she asked me if I wanted
to go upstairs with her.

30:40.633 --> 30:43.100
She took me into
one of the bedrooms

30:43.100 --> 30:45.800
and made me lie on the bed

30:45.800 --> 30:49.700
and told me that
she'd stop if I moved.

30:51.300 --> 30:55.267
She got out my penis
and started pulling it.

30:57.167 --> 31:02.167
After I ejaculated,
she got up and left

31:03.900 --> 31:07.433
and then I climbed
out of the window

31:07.433 --> 31:09.667
and left the party.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.933
My last girlfriend was Amanda.

31:11.933 --> 31:16.267
When I left high school, I was
working at the supermarket,

31:16.267 --> 31:19.067
stacking shelves and
collecting trolleys,

31:19.067 --> 31:21.133
and Amanda worked in the deli.

31:21.133 --> 31:23.567
One time when we
were having lunch

31:23.567 --> 31:27.467
she said, "Stop
looking at my tits."

31:27.467 --> 31:29.433
and I said, "I wasn't."

31:29.433 --> 31:34.433
and then said, "Do
you wanna see my tits?"

31:35.967 --> 31:38.333
"You look at me when
I'm talking to you."

31:38.333 --> 31:39.967
and then when I looked up,

31:39.967 --> 31:42.133
she had hers breasts out.

31:42.133 --> 31:45.367
I lost my virginity that night.

31:46.233 --> 31:51.233
Over the next year, we
had sex three times.

31:51.633 --> 31:55.800
I been pretty much
alone since then.

31:55.800 --> 31:57.900
It's not too bad.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.533
I don't hate my life.

32:03.100 --> 32:05.267
It's just that,

32:05.267 --> 32:10.067
loneliness can do
things to people.

32:14.067 --> 32:18.867
Unless I've got
my van and my t.v.

32:18.867 --> 32:21.833
and Katie.

32:21.833 --> 32:24.300
Life's never boring with a t.v.

32:24.300 --> 32:27.533
'Round the Block, my favorite
show's about to start.

32:27.533 --> 32:29.633
Last night Bobby died.

32:29.633 --> 32:31.200
Exciting times.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.700
Can't wait to see
what happens next.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.500
Until next time,

32:39.267 --> 32:55.167
(television theme music)

32:59.367 --> 33:01.900
I can't believe Bobby's gone.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.933
I know.

33:06.267 --> 33:10.500
I told him to
stop train surfing.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.167
[Voiceover] How do you
think Ralph is taking it?

33:14.167 --> 33:17.400
Who knows?

33:17.400 --> 33:22.400
With Slug back in
town causing trouble,

33:22.900 --> 33:24.900
anything could happen.

33:24.900 --> 33:31.133

to go to work, Sweetie.

34:18.367 --> 34:29.800
(soft acoustic music)

34:33.766 --> 34:37.900
Yeah, yeah, that
cunt over there.

34:37.900 --> 34:40.800
I'll fucking sort him out.

34:42.333 --> 34:47.333
(dramatic music)

34:47.400 --> 34:52.266
(yelling)

34:52.266 --> 34:54.833
Look at me, cunt.

34:54.833 --> 34:56.500
Help, somebody help!

34:56.500 --> 34:58.900
Nobody's gonna help
you now, dickhead.

34:58.900 --> 35:00.233
You been having a
go at me misses.

35:00.233 --> 35:01.267
No.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.467
Yeah you have.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.767
You wanna have a go at her,

35:03.767 --> 35:04.967
you have a go at me.

35:04.967 --> 35:06.733
Think you're a
fucking tough cunt?

35:06.733 --> 35:08.467
I never had a go at her.

35:08.467 --> 35:10.067
You called her a liar.

35:10.067 --> 35:13.067
No, I just told her that
her son stole from me.

35:13.067 --> 35:14.900
I don't give a shit.

35:14.900 --> 35:16.767
Get out of the fucking van.

35:16.767 --> 35:18.133
No.

35:18.133 --> 35:19.933
You want me to come in there?

35:19.933 --> 35:21.800
You couldn't, it's locked.

35:21.800 --> 35:24.367
We'll smash the
fucking door in.

35:24.367 --> 35:26.067
It's a pretty heavy door.

35:26.067 --> 35:28.367
You don't reckon I
couldn't rip the door

35:28.367 --> 35:30.467
off this fucking piece of shit?

35:30.467 --> 35:32.700
Probably not.

35:34.533 --> 35:38.633
Listen, you fucking get out
here and face me like a man.

35:38.633 --> 35:39.900
Please let me go.

35:39.900 --> 35:41.700
I don't want any trouble.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.567
Well, fucking tough now.

35:43.567 --> 35:44.500
I'm sorry.

35:44.500 --> 35:46.333
I won't say anything ever again.

35:48.633 --> 35:49.867
I'm sorry.

35:49.867 --> 35:58.967
You will be.

36:03.433 --> 36:05.067
What happened.

36:05.067 --> 36:08.067
You shoulda seen the
look on that fucker's face.

36:08.067 --> 36:17.067
He was fucking shitting.

36:21.567 --> 36:26.467
(tapping)

36:27.933 --> 36:29.700
I'm closed.

36:29.700 --> 36:31.333
I'm sorry.

36:31.333 --> 36:33.400
I'm sorry, Katie.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.933
No, that's okay.

36:34.933 --> 36:36.833
Are you alright?

36:36.833 --> 36:38.867
Yeah.

36:38.867 --> 36:41.167
I'm just a little bit shaken up.

36:41.167 --> 36:42.400
It's alright.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.867
Do you want to talk about it.

36:43.867 --> 36:45.333
No, it's nothing.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.200
Honestly.

36:48.333 --> 36:50.433
So how are you?

36:50.433 --> 36:52.500
Yeah, I'm good.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.233
Still just filming.

36:55.567 --> 36:57.767
So, where have
you been filming?

36:57.767 --> 37:00.067
Oh, um, just at the
park around the corner.

37:00.067 --> 37:02.267
Yeah, we're doing
a picnic scene.

37:02.267 --> 37:04.267
Between you and
your boyfriend?

37:04.267 --> 37:06.367
On screen boyfriend.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.067
Yeah.

37:08.067 --> 37:10.067
What about your
real boyfriend?

37:10.067 --> 37:11.967
Does he visit you on set?

37:11.967 --> 37:14.100
I don't have a boyfriend.

37:14.100 --> 37:15.933
Really?

37:15.933 --> 37:18.900
Look, I have to get back.

37:18.900 --> 37:21.667
But thanks for the chat, Warren.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.733
Bye, Katie.

37:28.733 --> 37:31.300
Big, big, big update.

37:31.300 --> 37:34.433
Katie George came
back to my van today.

37:34.433 --> 37:36.800
And the best part is,

37:36.800 --> 37:38.500
she didn't even
come for ice cream.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.267
She just came to talk to me.

37:40.267 --> 37:42.600
Like, just for a casual chat,

37:42.600 --> 37:44.733
like we're friends.

37:44.733 --> 37:47.400
I'm so excited.

37:47.400 --> 37:50.967
I learned heaps about her today.

37:50.967 --> 37:52.667
She doesn't have a boyfriend.

37:52.667 --> 37:54.200
She's not superficial.

37:54.200 --> 37:56.200
She's perfect.

37:57.500 --> 38:01.467
She's definitely going to
come back to my van again.

38:01.467 --> 38:04.367
And when she does,

38:05.233 --> 38:07.633
that's when I'll make my move.

39:31.467 --> 39:33.067
How are ya?

39:33.067 --> 39:35.733
Not bad, and yourself?

39:35.733 --> 39:37.367
[Voiceover] Horny.

39:37.367 --> 39:38.900
Okay.

39:38.900 --> 39:42.067
[Voiceover] Well before
I was doing some knitting.

39:42.067 --> 39:44.900
Using my fingers
got me thinkin',

39:44.900 --> 39:45.900
should be using
'em for something

39:45.900 --> 39:48.900
a little more important.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.300
What?

39:50.300 --> 39:52.300
[Voiceover] Fingering myself.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.533
That a bit too much?

39:55.533 --> 39:57.367
A little bit.

39:57.367 --> 39:59.433
[Voiceover] Well,
why don't you tell me

39:59.433 --> 40:01.567
how you'd like to start it.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.700
I don't know.

40:03.700 --> 40:06.667
I've never done this
sort of thing before.

40:06.667 --> 40:08.900
I didn't know what I was in for.

40:08.900 --> 40:10.167
[Voiceover] Well, I mean,

40:10.167 --> 40:12.133
you did call the
Granny Twatline,

40:12.133 --> 40:15.000
so, I've got a question
for you, Warren.

40:15.000 --> 40:16.267
Yeah?

40:16.267 --> 40:19.667
[Voiceover] Are you
hear to chat or wank?

40:21.100 --> 40:23.033
Ralph wouldn't do that!

40:23.033 --> 40:24.233
Slug's his son!

40:24.233 --> 40:25.267
[Voiceover] Oh, bullshit!

40:25.267 --> 40:26.833
Ralph wants him gone.

40:26.833 --> 40:29.467
There's a soft side to Ralph.

40:29.467 --> 40:30.400
[Voiceover] You reckon?

40:30.400 --> 40:32.667
Yeah, a definite soft spot.

40:32.667 --> 40:33.800
[Voiceover] No.

40:33.800 --> 40:35.867
He's a good ol'
fashioned hard man.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.567
I don't know.

40:37.567 --> 40:39.567
So, how old does one have to be

40:39.567 --> 40:41.533
to work for the Granny Twatline?

40:41.533 --> 40:43.500
[Voiceover] Ah,
doesn't really matter.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.300
If I'm being honest,

40:45.300 --> 40:47.367
most of them are blokes anyway.

40:47.367 --> 40:48.633
Seriously?

40:48.633 --> 40:50.167
[Voiceover] Yeah.

40:50.167 --> 40:51.400
Are you?

40:51.400 --> 40:53.300
[Voiceover] No, sweetheart.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.667
I'm a lady.

40:54.667 --> 40:57.933
Well, Warren, do you
want some advice?

40:57.933 --> 40:59.133
Yeah.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.567
[Voiceover] If you
want Katie George,

41:00.567 --> 41:02.967
you just need to tell
her how you feel.

41:02.967 --> 41:04.700
Let her know you can
take care of her,

41:04.700 --> 41:07.067
cause that's what
every girl needs.

41:07.067 --> 41:08.067
You think?

41:08.067 --> 41:09.500
[Voiceover] Definitely.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.667
Go for it, Warren.

41:10.667 --> 41:12.067
You seem like a gentleman.

41:12.067 --> 41:13.200
Thanks.

41:13.200 --> 41:14.300
[Voiceover] So,
just go get her.

41:14.300 --> 41:17.467
(The Wizard by Jimmie Rodgers)

41:17.467 --> 41:21.833
* One day I met a
wizard, many years ago

41:21.833 --> 41:23.567
* He was very very old

41:23.567 --> 41:25.967
* He was very very wise

41:25.967 --> 41:29.700
* He told me a
secret, many years ago

41:29.700 --> 41:31.767
* How to live, how to love,

41:31.767 --> 41:34.300
* How to win the golden prize

41:34.300 --> 41:36.267
* Tell 'em what the wizard says

41:36.267 --> 41:38.233
* Tell 'em what the wizard says

41:38.233 --> 41:40.333
* All you have to do
is snap your fingers

41:40.333 --> 41:42.400
* Make a wish and
snap your fingers

41:42.400 --> 41:44.067
* That's what you have to do

41:44.067 --> 41:45.767
* And your wishes

41:45.767 --> 41:50.200
* Will all come true

41:50.200 --> 41:52.400
* One day I met a maiden

41:52.400 --> 41:54.400
* With honey colored hair

41:54.400 --> 41:56.400
* There never was a maiden

41:56.400 --> 41:58.367
* So beautiful somewhere

41:58.367 --> 42:02.400
* The first time that I

42:06.867 --> 42:11.633
(car starting)

42:14.433 --> 42:16.400
I need that spot.

42:16.400 --> 42:18.067
I've been there for years.

42:18.067 --> 42:19.067
I can't let some

42:19.067 --> 42:22.600
scum bully push me out of there.

42:24.100 --> 42:27.500
Plus, Katie knows
that's my spot.

42:27.500 --> 42:29.433
If I'm not there,

42:29.433 --> 42:32.567
she won't be able to find me.

42:32.567 --> 42:35.100
You think you can handle this.

42:35.100 --> 42:38.600
Well, try this on for size.

42:39.533 --> 42:43.133
I don't want to see you
around here anymore.

42:45.400 --> 42:50.333
Now, I don't want to see
you around here anymore.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.067
I'll be back in two days.

42:52.067 --> 42:54.333
Okay.

42:54.333 --> 43:04.933
And I'll call you later.

43:09.533 --> 43:10.300
Hi.

43:10.300 --> 43:11.700
Good day.

43:11.700 --> 43:12.867
Sorry to bother you.

43:12.867 --> 43:14.133
I'm actually new in town

43:14.133 --> 43:16.067
and I was looking for the diner.

43:16.067 --> 43:18.467
I was told I could go
there to find some work.

43:18.467 --> 43:19.800
Oh, okay.

43:21.433 --> 43:23.800
If you just go to
the end of the street

43:23.800 --> 43:26.267
and turn left,
you can't miss it.

43:26.267 --> 43:27.767
Cool.

43:27.767 --> 43:29.433
Thanks.

43:29.433 --> 43:31.433
No worries.

43:35.467 --> 43:37.833
I'm Clint, by the way.

43:37.833 --> 43:39.633
Stacey.

43:40.567 --> 43:42.333
Nice to meet you, Stacey.

43:42.333 --> 43:44.267
Yeah.

43:48.767 --> 43:51.533
(grunting)

43:51.533 --> 43:54.733
(phone ringing)

43:54.733 --> 43:56.700
[Voiceover] Hello?

43:56.700 --> 43:58.867
Hey Stace, how are you?

43:58.867 --> 44:00.133
[Voiceover] Good.

44:00.133 --> 44:04.933
Hey, have you seen
that new guy in town?

44:04.933 --> 44:06.300
Clint?

44:06.300 --> 44:08.533
No, why.

44:08.533 --> 44:11.133
I was just wondering.

44:11.133 --> 44:12.433
Why?

44:12.433 --> 44:14.867
Have you got a crush
on him or something?

44:14.867 --> 44:16.233
Maybe.

44:17.133 --> 44:19.233
What about Tommo?

44:20.500 --> 44:23.300
[Voiceover] He's always away.

44:23.300 --> 44:27.733
I need someone who
can take care of me.

44:27.733 --> 44:28.967
[Voiceover] What and you think

44:28.967 --> 44:31.100
this Clint character,
he can take care of you?

44:31.100 --> 44:33.500
Maybe.

44:33.500 --> 44:36.133
[Voiceover] Well, what
do you want to happen?

44:36.133 --> 44:39.433
I hope he asks me out.

44:40.800 --> 44:49.867
I'm lonely.

44:54.367 --> 44:56.400
Hey, Ruby.

44:58.333 --> 45:00.100
Hey.

45:00.100 --> 45:08.567
Just that, please.

45:12.767 --> 45:20.100
That's someone else's parcel.

45:24.567 --> 45:26.133
Okay, yeah.

45:26.133 --> 45:27.800
Sorry.

45:27.800 --> 45:29.800
Thanks.

45:33.600 --> 45:36.800
Are you alright?

45:36.800 --> 45:38.067
Yeah.

45:38.067 --> 45:39.300
Sorry, Warren.

45:39.300 --> 45:41.267
I'm just a bit tired.

45:41.267 --> 45:43.433
I had a big night.

45:46.767 --> 45:48.267
Okay.

45:49.400 --> 45:51.767
See you later, Ruby.

45:51.767 --> 45:58.200
Bye.

46:02.433 --> 46:16.333
(television in background)

46:20.933 --> 46:22.400
Sorry.

46:22.400 --> 46:24.133
Your alright, mate.

46:24.133 --> 46:25.800
Sweet pics of Katie George.

46:25.800 --> 46:28.067
Man, she's fit.

46:29.967 --> 46:31.933
How can I help you.

46:31.933 --> 46:33.733
Hey man, don't get snippy.

46:33.733 --> 46:36.100
I'll just get vanilla.

46:36.100 --> 46:38.267
Cup or cone?

46:39.433 --> 46:42.500
Cone, man.

46:42.500 --> 46:44.767
Pack it tight.

46:44.767 --> 46:46.733
Chocolate?

46:48.533 --> 46:51.867
What?

46:51.867 --> 46:54.167
Do you want it
dipped in chocolate?

46:54.167 --> 46:55.767
Oh, yeah, man, sorry.

46:55.767 --> 46:57.333
I thought it was
code for something.

46:57.333 --> 46:58.500
Yeah, yeah, chocolate.

46:58.500 --> 46:59.667
Yeah, yeah.

46:59.667 --> 47:01.433
Nuts?

47:01.433 --> 47:03.433
Nah, nah.

47:06.600 --> 47:07.367
Oh, yeah, yeah.

47:07.367 --> 47:07.933
Nuts.

47:07.933 --> 47:08.833
Nuts.

47:08.833 --> 47:11.567
Don't be shy.

47:11.567 --> 47:13.867
I love nuts.

47:13.867 --> 47:16.367
* Mmm, draggin'

47:16.367 --> 47:19.667
* Steel wheels

47:22.700 --> 47:25.767
$4.00.

47:30.367 --> 47:31.933
Um.

47:33.533 --> 47:36.867
I've only got like, $2.35.

47:39.433 --> 47:41.633
What about him?

47:46.067 --> 47:48.433
Hey mate, mate,

47:48.433 --> 47:51.333
you got any change?

47:55.667 --> 47:57.167
You're a legend, man.

47:57.167 --> 48:00.433
You are the wizard of ice cream.

48:02.433 --> 48:04.767
Yeah, thanks.

48:07.167 --> 48:08.400
Awesome.

48:08.400 --> 48:12.933
I'm lovin' that shit, man.

48:17.533 --> 48:19.833
Fuck.

48:21.133 --> 48:23.900
Can I have another?

48:25.400 --> 48:32.067
(trains)

48:36.633 --> 48:38.233
Hey.

48:38.233 --> 48:40.233
Someone's not so tough now.

48:40.233 --> 48:41.600
Oh yeah, ya twat.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.967
Leave me alone.

48:45.167 --> 48:47.500
Mess with my girl again

48:47.500 --> 48:49.700
and I will kick the
shit out of you.

48:49.700 --> 48:52.567
Got that, dickhead?

48:56.933 --> 48:59.400
Fucking pathetic.

48:59.400 --> 49:13.967
(acoustic guitar music)

49:18.200 --> 49:21.733
On this day 14 years ago,

49:24.733 --> 49:27.567
my big sister, Margaret, died.

49:29.333 --> 49:32.733
I always thought my
sister was so cool.

49:33.933 --> 49:36.967
I always looked up to her.

49:38.367 --> 49:41.200
When I first
started high school,

49:41.200 --> 49:44.933
some kid pushed me over,

49:44.933 --> 49:47.700
and my sister saw,

49:47.700 --> 49:51.233
and she came straight over,

49:51.233 --> 49:53.333
and pushed him up
against the wall

49:53.333 --> 49:56.067
at the basketball courts

49:56.067 --> 50:00.633
and said, "If you
ever touch him again",

50:01.933 --> 50:04.900
"I'll fucking kill you."

50:08.067 --> 50:11.633
She left school at
the end of that year.

50:14.733 --> 50:18.167
That's when the
bullying started.

50:19.900 --> 50:21.733
[Voiceover] I'll
be back in two days.

50:21.733 --> 50:24.400
[Voiceover] Okay.

50:24.400 --> 50:41.200
[Voiceover] And
I'll call you later.

50:45.400 --> 51:00.100
(flipping through commercials)

51:04.400 --> 51:19.367
(Old Western music)

51:23.333 --> 51:26.667
Here's your pay
for a job well done.

51:30.133 --> 51:32.567
Did he beg?

51:34.767 --> 51:36.900
Good.

51:40.367 --> 51:43.833
See you 'round, limpy.

51:45.267 --> 51:46.900
Hey.

51:50.900 --> 51:52.833
What?

51:54.467 --> 51:59.067
You know he offered me
double for me to kill you.

52:00.267 --> 52:01.667
Yeah?

52:01.667 --> 52:04.567
What did you tell him?

52:07.067 --> 52:10.800
Same thing I told
you a long time ago.

52:10.800 --> 52:15.667
What was that?

52:19.900 --> 52:21.767
I never turn down a job.

52:21.767 --> 52:23.267
(gunshot)

52:23.267 --> 52:40.967
(dramatic Western music)

52:45.467 --> 52:50.467
(trembling)

52:53.500 --> 52:57.433
I have a recurring
dream about you, Katie.

52:57.433 --> 53:01.500
You come to my van,
just like before,

53:02.533 --> 53:04.633
but it's different.

53:07.400 --> 53:12.400
You got bedroom eyes,

53:12.467 --> 53:15.333
and a cheeky smile.

53:17.633 --> 53:21.067
And you take my hand,

53:21.067 --> 53:24.333
and you want me to run with you.

53:24.333 --> 53:27.633
And I say that I can't run.

53:30.567 --> 53:32.100
You say,

53:34.067 --> 53:37.600
"Baby, with me, you
were born to run."

53:40.400 --> 53:44.100
And then I wake up every morning

53:46.567 --> 53:49.067
and I'm smiling

53:49.067 --> 53:51.500
because of you.

53:55.500 --> 54:00.533
(soft music)

54:01.367 --> 54:06.367
(children talking)

54:07.433 --> 54:11.533
(party noise-makers)

54:15.733 --> 54:17.500
Can I please have chocolate?

54:17.500 --> 54:18.767
Can I have rainbow?

54:18.767 --> 54:22.467
I want chocolate
and sprinkles.

54:22.467 --> 54:29.567
Can I have a rainbow please?

54:33.500 --> 54:43.067
(children laughing
and party poppers)

54:47.467 --> 54:48.833
Hey Warren!

54:48.833 --> 54:49.600
Hi Katie.

54:49.600 --> 54:50.467
How are you today?

54:50.467 --> 54:51.500
Yeah, good.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.767
Craving some ice cream.

54:52.767 --> 54:54.233
What were you thinking?

54:54.233 --> 54:55.233
I'm not sure.

54:55.233 --> 54:56.533
What would you recommend?

54:56.533 --> 54:57.967
It's a tough decision.

54:57.967 --> 55:02.367
But maybe mango gelati, if
you like that sort of thing?

55:02.367 --> 55:04.600
That sounds amazing.

55:04.600 --> 55:05.867
It's my favorite.

55:05.867 --> 55:08.500
Well, I'll take one
scoop of that, thanks.

55:08.500 --> 55:10.167
Okay.

55:10.167 --> 55:12.733
So, how are you today?

55:12.733 --> 55:15.700
Yeah, good, how
'bout yourself?

55:15.700 --> 55:17.233
Can't complain.

55:18.433 --> 55:20.333
Were you filming today?

55:20.333 --> 55:21.933
Yeah.

55:21.933 --> 55:25.100
We actually finished up
at this location today.

55:27.733 --> 55:29.067
Really?

55:29.067 --> 55:30.367
Yeah.

55:34.300 --> 55:36.967
So you won't be coming
around here anymore?

55:38.067 --> 55:42.500
Yeah.

55:47.133 --> 55:49.433
Mmm.

55:50.967 --> 55:53.067
This is amazing.

55:53.067 --> 55:54.233
How much do I owe? - [Warren]
Katie would you go out

55:54.233 --> 55:56.700
to dinner with me sometime?

55:58.500 --> 56:00.200
Sure.

56:00.200 --> 56:02.633
I'd love to go to
dinner with you.

56:02.633 --> 56:04.100
Cool.

56:04.100 --> 56:05.100
Thanks.

56:05.100 --> 56:06.067
You don't have to thank me.

56:06.067 --> 56:07.567
It'd be my pleasure.

56:07.567 --> 56:08.467
Really?

56:08.467 --> 56:10.367
Okay.

56:11.200 --> 56:13.800
When would you like to go out?

56:13.800 --> 56:17.400
Well, I'm free most nights.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.300
Okay.

56:19.300 --> 56:21.300
Why don't you just pick
me up from the studio?

56:21.300 --> 56:22.500
Alright.

56:22.500 --> 56:23.433
Okay.

56:23.433 --> 56:25.300
When?

56:25.300 --> 56:27.333
Tomorrow night.

56:27.333 --> 56:29.167
Definitely.

56:29.167 --> 56:30.300
Okay.

56:30.300 --> 56:32.100
Well, how much do I owe you?

56:32.100 --> 56:33.267
Don't worry about that.

56:33.267 --> 56:35.067
Free of charge.

56:35.067 --> 56:37.800
Thank you.

56:37.800 --> 56:40.767
Well, I guess I'll see
you tomorrow night.

56:40.767 --> 56:41.933
Definitely.

56:41.933 --> 56:44.500
Alright, well, see
ya then, sweetie.

56:44.500 --> 56:45.200
Bye bye.

56:45.200 --> 56:47.367
Bye.

56:47.367 --> 56:59.533
(soft acoustic music)

57:03.400 --> 57:07.467
[Voiceover] (giggling)
I'm so glad I found you.

57:11.700 --> 57:15.333
Hello, hello?

57:17.533 --> 57:19.433
As much as I love Unforgiven,

57:19.433 --> 57:21.833
I still think The Good,
The Bad, and The Ugly

57:21.833 --> 57:24.167
is the greatest film ever made.

57:24.167 --> 57:27.167
Nothing that epic
has been made since.

57:28.767 --> 57:31.667
Top 10 Clint Eastwood films,

57:31.667 --> 57:34.467
number ten, Magnum Force.

57:34.467 --> 57:36.967
I always wanted to be a singer.

57:36.967 --> 57:38.467
When I was in primary school,

57:38.467 --> 57:39.733
I was in the choir.

57:39.733 --> 57:42.733
It wasn't really music
I liked to listen to.

57:42.733 --> 57:46.433
I like love songs
in the 50s and 60s.

57:46.433 --> 57:51.433
* Good, good, good,
good vibrations *

57:51.933 --> 57:54.900
* Ohh, ohh, ohh,

57:54.900 --> 57:58.633
* Walk like a man

57:58.633 --> 58:02.533
* As his mama cries

58:03.533 --> 58:07.067
* On a cold gray Chicago mornin'

58:08.600 --> 58:12.500
* And another little
baby child is born

58:16.633 --> 58:20.067
* In the ghetto

58:20.067 --> 58:22.400
[Voiceover] Previously
on 'Round the Block.

58:22.400 --> 58:24.200
[Voiceover] You're
just not around enough.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.500
Well, what do you
want me to do, Stace?

58:25.500 --> 58:27.767
I've got to pay
the bills, don't I?

58:28.900 --> 58:31.167
I can't do this anymore.

58:31.167 --> 58:43.667
Stacey, what are
you trying to say?

58:48.267 --> 58:50.500
Bobby?

58:50.500 --> 58:53.400
Yes, it's me.

58:53.400 --> 58:56.067
Why are you visiting me?

58:56.067 --> 58:58.067
I need to tell you.

58:58.067 --> 59:00.500
[Voiceover] What?

59:00.500 --> 59:02.833
Follow your heart.

59:02.833 --> 59:04.767
Follow my heart?

59:04.767 --> 59:08.200
Always follow your heart.

59:09.933 --> 59:12.500
What do you mean?

59:12.500 --> 59:17.267
You'll understand.

59:21.467 --> 59:24.100
So, what are you going to do?

59:24.100 --> 59:26.067
I don't know.

59:26.067 --> 59:27.933
I can't make up my mind.

59:27.933 --> 59:30.533
You need to start
thinking about it.

59:30.533 --> 59:33.967
Is it Tommo or Clint?

59:35.267 --> 59:37.500
[Voiceover] Follow your heart.

59:37.500 --> 59:41.533
Bobby told me to
follow my heart.

59:42.433 --> 59:45.600
Well, what's your
heart telling you to do?

59:47.467 --> 59:48.867
[Voiceover] Killer waves, bro.

59:48.867 --> 59:50.533
[Voiceover] Tell me about it.

59:50.533 --> 59:53.667
Looks like you've
got a visitor, bro.

59:58.133 --> 01:00:02.267
Hey Stacey.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.400
I'll leave you guys alone.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:12.067
Later, bro.

01:00:12.067 --> 01:00:14.467
So, what's goin' on?

01:00:14.467 --> 01:00:17.133
Nothin'.

01:00:17.133 --> 01:00:19.267
Can't be nothing.

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:20.800
What's up?

01:00:22.433 --> 01:00:27.133
Look, I'm just gonna be
honest with you, Clint.

01:00:27.133 --> 01:00:29.200
I like you.

01:00:30.467 --> 01:00:32.467
Do you like me?

01:00:32.467 --> 01:00:34.933
Yeah, of course.

01:00:34.933 --> 01:00:39.400
Well, do you wanna go
for a coffee or something?

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.633
Yeah.

01:00:40.633 --> 01:01:00.067
I'd love that.

01:01:04.533 --> 01:01:16.167
Hi.

01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.567
Box of chocolates, eh?

01:01:23.567 --> 01:01:25.700
These for a lucky lady?

01:01:25.700 --> 01:01:28.233
They're for no one.

01:01:29.433 --> 01:01:31.333
How much are they?

01:01:31.333 --> 01:01:33.267
$12.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:39.467
Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.

01:01:39.467 --> 01:01:41.433
That's alright.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.167
Where's Ruby?

01:01:45.167 --> 01:01:48.267
Is she the girl who
used to work here?

01:01:48.267 --> 01:01:49.367
I don't know.

01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:50.633
I guess she's quit.

01:01:50.633 --> 01:01:52.933
I just started today.

01:01:55.367 --> 01:01:58.767
Is she a friend of yours?

01:01:58.767 --> 01:02:02.867
Yeah, yeah she is.

01:02:07.367 --> 01:02:10.167
Thank you.

01:02:10.167 --> 01:02:12.400
See you.

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:15.067
Everything I've been doing,

01:02:15.067 --> 01:02:17.633
everything I've ever wanted

01:02:17.633 --> 01:02:20.400
has lead me to today.

01:02:22.533 --> 01:02:25.400
Wish me luck.

01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:39.067
(upbeat 50s music)

01:02:42.733 --> 01:02:45.767
* Bill met a boy with a
boy who could play, you bet

01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:49.633
* Oh how they played when
they played on his old cornet

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:54.200
* He's got a smile and cute
little style that's all his own

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:56.500
* He'd mute his old cornet

01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:58.733
* And then he'd make it moan

01:02:58.733 --> 01:03:02.067
* Do, do, do, do, do, do

01:03:03.333 --> 01:03:05.433
* Nothing to it, but it's sweet

01:03:05.433 --> 01:03:07.467
* That tune goes
right to your feet

01:03:07.467 --> 01:03:09.400
* Do, do, do, do,
made a hit with a girl

01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:11.533
* They had the hair
bobbin', gave him a curl

01:03:11.533 --> 01:03:40.567
* Oh how he blew
that do, do, do, do *

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.200
See you tomorrow, Ralphie.

01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:48.600
Have a nice one, Miss George.

01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:50.233
Hi, Katie.

01:03:50.233 --> 01:03:52.067
Hi, how ya doin?

01:03:52.067 --> 01:03:52.633

01:03:52.633 --> 01:03:53.600
How are you?

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.267
Yeah, good, thanks.

01:03:55.267 --> 01:03:57.300
So, you ready to
go out for dinner?

01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:58.767
What?

01:03:58.767 --> 01:04:01.200
Remember, you said we're
gonna go out for dinner?

01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:02.933
(laughs) Excuse me?

01:04:02.933 --> 01:04:04.333
Remember?

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:06.167
I've never met you
before in my life.

01:04:06.167 --> 01:04:08.367
But Katie, it's me, Warren.

01:04:08.367 --> 01:04:10.567
Okay, stop following me.

01:04:10.567 --> 01:04:12.067
Are you okay
there, Miss George?

01:04:12.067 --> 01:04:14.133
But Katie, I
gave you ice cream.

01:04:14.133 --> 01:04:17.433
Stop following me or I'm
gonna call for security.

01:04:17.433 --> 01:04:19.867
You're gonna throw away
everything that we have.

01:04:19.867 --> 01:04:21.600
I have no idea who
the fuck you are.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.600
Just leave me alone.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.933
You okay?

01:04:32.533 --> 01:05:07.067
(crying)

01:05:11.567 --> 01:05:13.467
(screaming)

01:05:13.467 --> 01:05:30.067
Fucking bitch!

01:05:34.367 --> 01:06:48.067
(television static)

01:06:52.267 --> 01:06:54.367
[Voiceover] Hey Warren.

01:06:55.367 --> 01:06:57.533
Warren, come here.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.633
Tell me you love me.

01:07:00.633 --> 01:07:01.867
I love you.

01:07:01.867 --> 01:07:05.133
(Katie talking to Warren
and television static)

01:07:05.133 --> 01:07:14.533
(screaming)

01:07:19.067 --> 01:07:30.900
(cutting hair)

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.067
(screaming)

01:07:41.067 --> 01:07:54.433
(dripping)

01:07:58.767 --> 01:08:02.567
Pretty, pretty Warren.

01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:06.667
I was never meant for friends.

01:08:07.567 --> 01:08:10.867
How could I be so
fucking stupid?

01:08:10.867 --> 01:08:13.167
You did this to me.

01:08:13.167 --> 01:08:14.333
This is what I think of you

01:08:14.333 --> 01:08:16.832
and your stupid fucking show.

01:08:16.832 --> 01:08:18.633
Look at this, Katie.

01:08:18.633 --> 01:08:23.600
(screaming)

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:33.966
(disturbing music)

01:08:38.300 --> 01:09:15.200
(television theme music)

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:23.399
Can I speak to Gloria, please?

01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:30.200
You're not Gloria.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.466
No, you're not.

01:09:34.332 --> 01:09:37.466
Don't fucking lie to me.

01:09:41.966 --> 01:09:46.767
(screaming)

01:09:49.100 --> 01:09:51.633
Pretty Katie George.

01:09:54.900 --> 01:10:01.333
Pretty lips.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:09.167
Beautiful lips for
kissing Warren.

01:10:09.167 --> 01:10:27.367
I love you.

01:10:31.867 --> 01:10:36.233
(banging)

01:10:36.233 --> 01:11:04.500
(television screen shattering)

01:11:08.433 --> 01:11:12.500
What are you looking
at, fucking freak?

01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.067
Huh?

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:59.567
Stupid cunt.

01:12:04.067 --> 01:12:06.233
You look good.

01:12:06.233 --> 01:12:08.367
Thank you.

01:12:08.367 --> 01:12:35.267
(trains)

01:12:39.500 --> 01:13:05.733
(dramatic haunting music)

01:13:10.233 --> 01:13:32.967
(screaming)

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:39.467
A few years back,

01:13:39.467 --> 01:13:41.700
I was stuck in
the habit of work.

01:13:41.700 --> 01:13:44.733
Whenever a new customer
would come up to the van,

01:13:44.733 --> 01:13:47.500
instead of asking,
"How can I help you?"

01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:51.467
I'd say, "Chocolate,
strawberry, vanilla."

01:13:51.467 --> 01:13:54.633
Because that's what
most people order.

01:13:54.633 --> 01:13:57.700
I was thinking that
I was wasting my time

01:13:57.700 --> 01:14:00.133
even having any other flavors.

01:14:01.133 --> 01:14:03.567
But then I realized,

01:14:03.567 --> 01:14:06.800
out of all the flavors
they could order,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.467
they'd still want chocolate,
strawberry, or vanilla,

01:14:11.467 --> 01:14:14.400
because it was their favorite.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.533
The problem wasn't with them.

01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:19.933
The problem was with me.

01:14:19.933 --> 01:14:23.467
I'd forgotten how much
people love ice cream.

01:14:24.467 --> 01:14:26.700
Hi Warren.

01:14:29.300 --> 01:14:32.300
I've learned to enjoy
the small things in life,

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:35.233
because sometimes
that's all you've got.

01:14:35.233 --> 01:14:39.633
Small reminders that not
everything has gone rotten.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.167
Life's unbearable
without variety.

01:14:45.067 --> 01:14:49.367
I'd certainly hope that I
could bring something different

01:14:49.367 --> 01:14:51.700
to the people in my life.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.067
Something to inspire them.

01:14:54.067 --> 01:14:56.567
Give them something
to talk about

01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:58.700
'cause at the end of the day,

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.933
that's all anyone can do,

01:15:01.933 --> 01:15:04.533
make an impression.

01:15:07.467 --> 01:15:10.400
I hope when I die

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:14.567
people will remember
me with a smile.

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:21.067
Clint Eastwood once said,

01:15:21.067 --> 01:15:23.733
he doesn't believe in pessimism.

01:15:23.733 --> 01:15:26.133
He said, "If something
doesn't come out"

01:15:26.133 --> 01:15:29.400
"the way you want, forge ahead."

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:32.767
"If you think it's
gonna rain, it will."

01:15:32.767 --> 01:15:36.100
This is Warren
Thompson, signing out.

01:15:37.367 --> 01:15:42.367
(soft sad music)
