00:49.080 --> 00:51.460
Mewmins and monster have just
misunderstood each other

00:51.460 --> 00:52.960
for too long.

00:52.960 --> 00:54.960
Mewni should be
a place of peace

00:54.960 --> 00:57.290
and unity
for everyone.

00:57.290 --> 00:58.790
Right, yes.

00:58.790 --> 01:01.080
Like they don't,
like, get peace
or whatever.

01:01.080 --> 01:03.250
But for that
to happen,

01:03.250 --> 01:05.460
we need to stop
following the old ways.

01:05.460 --> 01:07.380
We need to be the change
we want to see.

01:07.380 --> 01:09.960
That's why I'm hoping
they'll sign

01:09.960 --> 01:13.790
this super awesome petition
of friendship between
monsters and Mewmins.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.380
Your signature is
the last one we need.

01:16.380 --> 01:19.750
So... what do you say?

01:19.750 --> 01:21.460
Will you sign?

01:23.880 --> 01:25.250
Um...

01:36.620 --> 01:38.790
Is this the same
Rich Pigeon that, like,

01:38.790 --> 01:40.580
killed it at
the Silver Bell Ball?

01:40.580 --> 01:43.330
Uh, I think so.

01:43.330 --> 01:44.920
Does he even understand
a word we're saying?

01:44.920 --> 01:47.620
I don't know.

01:47.620 --> 01:49.040
We've never
actually talked.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.040
But just to make it
easier for you...

01:52.040 --> 01:55.000
Pen.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.830
Petition.

01:56.830 --> 01:58.880
Sign.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.040
Come on, Star,
he's just a dumb bird.

02:03.040 --> 02:06.170
You can't expect him
to envision a utopian future.

02:06.170 --> 02:08.210
Marco.

02:08.210 --> 02:09.880
Ignore him.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.000
How about one blink
for yes, and two for no?

02:14.620 --> 02:17.210
Look, just, like,
grab his little foot
or whatever,

02:17.210 --> 02:19.170
and sign the petition
for him so we can
get outta here.

02:19.170 --> 02:20.830
This place is
giving me the creeps.

02:20.830 --> 02:23.040
Yeah, Marco's right.

02:23.040 --> 02:25.620
Whoa, did I just
say that out loud?

02:25.620 --> 02:28.250
You just hold the petition,
and I'll grab his foot.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.880
Yeah, I don't
know, Marco.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.750
Doesn't really sound
like the right way to go.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.420
Relax. I've seen
all the bird videos online.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.000
I've got this.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.920
Okay, okay.
Just be gentle.

02:37.920 --> 02:40.710
See, now.
There we go.

02:40.710 --> 02:43.000
Birds feel weird.

02:46.000 --> 02:48.920
Marco!
What did you do?

02:48.920 --> 02:51.420
That was not gentle.
Fix it, fix it,
fix it now!

02:51.420 --> 02:53.580
Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry.

03:15.120 --> 03:16.920
Run!!

03:20.920 --> 03:23.170
Marco, I told you
to be gentle.

03:23.170 --> 03:25.500
I was gentle.

03:28.080 --> 03:29.670
Crystal narwhal...

03:29.670 --> 03:31.250
My wand!

03:35.080 --> 03:37.170
- A little help, please.
- I got you, Marco.

03:51.170 --> 03:54.960
I told you, birds don't
see what doesn't move.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.250
Quick, in here.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.170
Okay, I think
we lost them.

04:04.170 --> 04:07.120
Oh, great, now we're
stuck in a room
with paintings?!

04:07.120 --> 04:09.880
I hate paintings.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.120
Wait, these are all
paintings of Rich Pigeon.

04:12.120 --> 04:15.040
Ah, bold, confident
brush work,

04:15.040 --> 04:17.170
with a subtle nod
to neoclassicism.
Nice.

04:20.830 --> 04:22.120
Wait. Barricade
the door.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.710
Pony Head,
where you going?

04:25.710 --> 04:28.040
I am sorry, but I cannot
deal with this anymore

04:28.040 --> 04:29.920
right now, okay?
I need to do me.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.000
Ah! Much better.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.170
Pony Head,
what are you doing?

04:36.170 --> 04:38.380
Get back here
and help us.

04:40.750 --> 04:43.540
Guys, come quick.
I think I found
something.

04:43.540 --> 04:45.330
Oh, thank Mewni.

04:45.330 --> 04:47.960
Look at me!

04:47.960 --> 04:49.460
I can dance now.

04:49.460 --> 04:51.750
Look at this!

04:51.750 --> 04:53.120
Rich Pigeon's legs.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.920
Pony Head, I don't see
how some extra legs

04:55.920 --> 04:58.210
and jewels are gonna
get us outta here.

04:58.210 --> 05:00.080
Well, first of all,
you are so wrong

05:00.080 --> 05:01.960
on so many levels,

05:01.960 --> 05:03.120
the second level being
that this is not

05:03.120 --> 05:04.500
what I found
that I'm talking about.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.460
Look at them calves.
Boom.

05:13.460 --> 05:15.210
Whoa, those are
some big legs.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.040
Everyone, pick a leg.

05:21.040 --> 05:23.290
- Hurry up!
- Sorry.

05:23.290 --> 05:26.000
We can't all just
float wherever we want.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.670
Definitely not
with that attitude.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.290
Look at
all these levers.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.210
Push them all!

05:32.210 --> 05:33.580
How does
this thing work?!

05:33.580 --> 05:35.040
Stop yelling.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.040
No, it feels
good right now.

05:37.040 --> 05:39.210
No, I mean it.
Stop yelling for one second.

05:39.210 --> 05:40.920
Do you hear that?

05:40.920 --> 05:42.460
I don't hear
anything.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.710
Exactly.
They stopped.

05:46.210 --> 05:47.880
Phew!

05:47.880 --> 05:50.170
Oh, thank karate.
Now let's get--

06:09.210 --> 06:10.710
Are they still
following us though?

06:10.710 --> 06:13.540
- Yep.

06:13.540 --> 06:17.080
They're blocking
the exit.

06:17.080 --> 06:19.120
Don't, stop. Marco,
you'll hurt the pigeons.

06:21.330 --> 06:23.500
Oh!

06:23.500 --> 06:27.290
Oh, hey, girl,
can I just ask you
something so quickly?

06:27.290 --> 06:29.170
What the heck!

06:29.170 --> 06:31.460
We were almost
out of this trash castle.

06:31.460 --> 06:34.920
If we hurt the pigeons,
we're never gonna get
Rich to sign the petition.

06:34.920 --> 06:38.000
You really think that's
still a possibility, Star?

06:42.460 --> 06:44.250
Hey, birds.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.120
Buddies.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.210
About all this...
we are so sorry.

06:51.330 --> 06:54.290
This is very normal
for me; it happens.

06:54.290 --> 06:56.040
I know how
to deal with it.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.290
Pony Head!

07:02.290 --> 07:03.670
I know what I am.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.920
Okay, we're so sorry

07:06.920 --> 07:08.420
things got
so out of hand...

07:08.420 --> 07:11.500
or claw...
or whatever you...

07:11.500 --> 07:15.250
Okay, listen, how about
we all just please start over.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.500
We didn't mean any harm
to Prince Rich Pigeon.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.380
We just wanted to...

07:20.620 --> 07:22.460
Pony Head!!

07:22.460 --> 07:24.080
I thought that we might
need him for leverage.

07:24.080 --> 07:25.960
Cool. Can't wait to die.

07:36.960 --> 07:40.040
How is this a fair trial?
We don't even know
what they're saying.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.500
Um, excuse me.

07:42.500 --> 07:44.830
King Pigeon, sir.
I just want to
apologize again

07:44.830 --> 07:46.790
for what happened
here today.

07:46.790 --> 07:49.330
We did not mean
to break your son's leg.

07:49.330 --> 07:51.120
Yeah, like, in
a thousand pieces.

07:51.120 --> 07:52.500
I was gentle.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.000
Okay, let's just...

07:54.000 --> 07:56.210
We didn't come here today
to hurt anyone.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.710
We just came here
to ask your son for help.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.830
Oh, my goodness!
This is not happening.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.120
No. No, no, no, no!

08:41.750 --> 08:44.330
Awww. Hey, there.

08:44.330 --> 08:46.290
Ow. That kinda hurt.

08:46.290 --> 08:48.380
Ow, ow, ow.

08:48.380 --> 08:50.920
Okay, okay.
Ow. That's annoying. Ow!

08:50.920 --> 08:53.620
Oh, I heard about
this before.

08:53.620 --> 08:56.460
It's death by
a thousand pecks.

08:56.460 --> 08:58.000
Ow. Well... ow...

08:58.000 --> 09:00.290
this is gonna... ow...
take forever. Ow.

09:12.290 --> 09:14.420
Set them free!

09:16.420 --> 09:18.710
He can talk?!
I knew it!

09:18.710 --> 09:21.620
And it's such a strong,
handsome man voice, too.

09:21.620 --> 09:23.380
Oh, my goodness.
Hello.

09:24.500 --> 09:28.120
Yes, Father, I disobeyed
pigeon law,

09:28.120 --> 09:30.170
and learned
the Mewni tongue.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.290
But I did it
for our kingdom's future.

09:32.290 --> 09:36.380
Why must we proud pigeons
continue to pretend

09:36.380 --> 09:38.000
to be mindless animals?

09:38.000 --> 09:41.540
Princess Butterfly
champions a noble cause--

09:41.540 --> 09:43.670
peace and friendship

09:43.670 --> 09:45.580
between the powerful
and the downtrodden.

09:45.580 --> 09:49.420
We must not let our prejudices
against the Mewmins

09:49.420 --> 09:52.670
prevent us from joining
her fight for justice.

09:52.670 --> 09:56.290
We are a small
but mighty empire.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.960
I love this kingdom,

09:57.960 --> 10:02.170
and it is my duty
as its prince to protect it,

10:02.170 --> 10:04.330
but it is also my duty
to bring it forth

10:04.330 --> 10:06.330
into the future.

10:06.330 --> 10:09.750
Star Butterfly,
you have inspired me.

10:09.750 --> 10:11.960
Seeing you work so hard,
it makes me want to be

10:11.960 --> 10:13.750
a greater prince
for the pigeons.

10:13.750 --> 10:17.210
Nay, nay, nay, nay.
For all of Mewni.

10:28.620 --> 10:31.250
We did it.
We got all the signatures!

10:31.250 --> 10:34.170
Yeah, thank you so much!

10:34.170 --> 10:36.330
And, uh, sorry about
busting up your castle.

10:36.330 --> 10:39.250
No, no, the damage
you did today

10:39.250 --> 10:41.250
was far less damage
than we did

10:41.250 --> 10:44.540
- when we conquered it
for ourselves.
From who?

10:44.540 --> 10:47.170
Oh, you didn't notice
the skeleton rotting
in the hall?

10:47.170 --> 10:49.750
Uh...

10:49.750 --> 10:52.120
Enough business.

10:52.120 --> 10:53.880
Now we must feast

10:53.880 --> 10:55.670
to celebrate
our new beginning.

10:55.670 --> 10:59.540
Finally!
I am starving!

10:59.540 --> 11:01.670
I could really go for
some pizza or, like,

11:01.670 --> 11:03.830
a bunch of soda
chips...

11:03.830 --> 11:06.420
So you know what?
You keep living

11:06.420 --> 11:08.540
your best life,
all right, and
I'm just gonna

11:08.540 --> 11:11.040
head out and not
stay here anymore.
