02:41.703 --> 02:47.664
NARRATOR: This yacht is bringing a
revolutionary invention to Gotham.

02:47.917 --> 02:51.751
On a peaceful motor ride,
millionaire Bruce Wayne...

02:52.005 --> 02:56.874
...and his ward, Dick Grayson,
have been summoned to Wayne Manor...

02:57.135 --> 03:01.048
...by an urgent but anonymous
call for help.

03:01.306 --> 03:06.221
The invention and its custodian
are reported in grave danger...

03:06.436 --> 03:08.267
...aboard the yacht.

03:08.521 --> 03:11.183
Never ones
to shirk responsibility...

03:11.441 --> 03:16.060
...Bruce and Dick, with
characteristic speed and resolve...

03:16.321 --> 03:19.279
...descend promptly to the Batcave.

03:19.532 --> 03:23.445
And then, as they have done
many times before...

03:23.703 --> 03:28.823
...as Batman and Robin,
courageous warriors against crime...

03:29.083 --> 03:33.122
...they are off, once again,
to the rescue.

03:34.547 --> 03:37.289
Batteries to power.
Turbines to speed.

03:37.550 --> 03:39.927
Roger. Ready to move out.

03:56.486 --> 04:00.946
Batmobile to airport, red alert.
Prepare Batcopter for takeoff.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.749
Batmobile approaching.

04:23.012 --> 04:27.346
MAN: Red Alert! Gotham Tower to all
aircraft in the control zone.

04:27.600 --> 04:32.970
Enter your holding pattern.
Batcopter cleared for takeoff.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.767
It's good to know
they're up there doing theirjob.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.083
Batdrift angle: 03 to starboard.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.918
Roger. Correcting to port.

05:51.851 --> 05:56.936
Altitude: 317. Sink rate: 0.49.

06:02.570 --> 06:06.609
-Drop Bat ladder.
-Bat ladder away.

06:26.219 --> 06:31.009
Lock computer on afterdeck.
Set automatic Bathold.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.142
Watch out. This could be tricky.

06:40.316 --> 06:46.607
Have no fear. I'll keep all my wits
about me. So long, for a minute.

07:19.230 --> 07:21.937
Batman to Robin,
ease off on the power!

07:28.739 --> 07:30.195
Increase sink rate!

07:32.243 --> 07:34.279
Roger! Wilco!

07:53.264 --> 07:54.845
Take her up!

08:02.482 --> 08:04.018
Holy sardine!

08:20.458 --> 08:23.916
Hand me down
the shark-repellent Bat spray!

09:29.068 --> 09:32.811
GORDON: Enough pictures.
BATMAN: This must be brief.

09:33.072 --> 09:37.987
O'HARA: You're lucky they'll talk.
-Mr. Merrick of The Gotham City Times.

09:38.744 --> 09:42.703
A yacht approaching the city
is said to have disappeared.

09:43.416 --> 09:47.000
-Nonsense. How can a yacht disappear?
-It isn't true?

09:47.420 --> 09:50.833
I stand on my answer.
Mr. Stanley of The Globe.

09:51.090 --> 09:55.208
-It was a Big Ben Distilleries yacht?
-That's right.

09:55.469 --> 09:58.256
Isn't the proprietor,
Commodore Schmidlapp...

09:58.514 --> 10:02.098
...bringing with him a new invention
from Big Ben's lab?

10:02.351 --> 10:06.344
-No more questions about that ship.
-What about that shark?

10:06.564 --> 10:10.978
BATMAN: Unfortunately, it chanced
to swallow a floating mine.

10:11.235 --> 10:14.568
I wouldn't worry about that.
You there, Miss--

10:15.072 --> 10:19.190
Comrade Kitanya lrenya Tatanya
Karenska Alisoff.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.988
From The Moscow Bug/e.

10:21.537 --> 10:25.121
You grace us with your presence.
May I be of service?

10:25.374 --> 10:29.117
Please, take off the mask
to give the better picture.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.287
-Batman take off his mask?
O'HARA: She's mad.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.710
BATMAN:
Chief O'Hara, all of you.

10:36.469 --> 10:40.929
This young lady is a stranger.
Her request is not unnatural...

10:41.182 --> 10:44.720
...however, impossible to grant.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.933
-lmpossible?
4ndeed.

10:48.064 --> 10:53.479
If we were to remove our masks,
our true identities would be revealed.

10:53.986 --> 11:00.073
-Ruining their value as crime fighters.
-Not even we know who they are.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.951
In fact, our own relatives don't know.

11:04.205 --> 11:07.322
But your so curious costumes...

11:07.583 --> 11:11.952
Don't be put off by them.
Under this we're ordinary Americans.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.667
You're like the masked vigilantes
in the Westerns?

11:16.050 --> 11:19.759
Batman and Robin are
deputized agents of the law!

11:20.012 --> 11:24.051
-"Support your police" is our message.
-Well said, Robin.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.133
And no better way to end
this conference.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.686
-Thank you and good day.
MAN: Batman--

11:30.940 --> 11:35.525
O'HARA: Never mind, everybody out.
Come on, we're all busy here.

11:35.986 --> 11:38.853
A fine job. You allayed their fears.

11:39.115 --> 11:42.357
If I'd told the truth,
panic would grip the city.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.364
The truth. And what is the truth?

11:45.996 --> 11:48.612
A decoy. An anonymous warning...

11:48.874 --> 11:52.537
...that Schmidlapp's in danger,
to lure me into a trap.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.334
An attempt on his life.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.922
While they were luring you
to a watery grave...

11:58.175 --> 12:00.336
...the yacht was being hijacked?

12:00.970 --> 12:03.461
-Precisely!
-And who behind it?

12:03.723 --> 12:07.181
What known super criminals
are at large now?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.475
I'll check at once, Batman.

12:09.687 --> 12:14.727
Let's have the latest status report
on criminals at large. Thank you.

12:14.942 --> 12:18.105
Coming up on
the closed-circuit TV screen.

12:23.159 --> 12:28.279
MAN: Status report. Known super
criminals not currently imprisoned.

12:28.539 --> 12:29.574
BATMAN:
Penguin.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.031
That pompous waddling
master of foul play...

12:32.209 --> 12:34.700
...maestro of a million
criminal umbrellas.

12:35.921 --> 12:38.788
ROBIN: Joker!
O'HARA: Clown prince of crime!

12:39.008 --> 12:42.341
If I had a nickel
for every time he baffled us!

12:44.096 --> 12:45.677
GORDON:
The Riddler too?

12:45.931 --> 12:50.550
So it seems.
To plague us with his conundrums.

12:50.853 --> 12:55.187
ROBIN: Gosh, and the Catwoman!
-End of status report.

12:55.441 --> 12:59.730
Could be any one of them,
but which one?

13:00.196 --> 13:02.061
Which ones?

13:02.323 --> 13:06.236
Pretty fishy what happened to me
on that ladder.

13:06.494 --> 13:11.238
-Where there's a fish, there's Penguin.
-Wait! It happened at sea.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.081
See? "C" for Catwoman!

13:14.293 --> 13:19.538
Yet, that exploding shark
was pulling my leg.

13:19.757 --> 13:24.342
-The Joker!
-It all adds up to a sinister riddle.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.095
Riddler. Riddler?

13:28.390 --> 13:31.382
A thought strikes me.

13:31.602 --> 13:35.845
So dreadful I scarcely dare
give it utterance.

13:36.065 --> 13:40.274
The four of them.
Their forces combined.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.944
-Holy nightmare!
-Batman, could it be?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.238
I don't know.

13:46.867 --> 13:50.860
But I think I know
where to find a clue.

13:51.080 --> 13:56.245
Robin, to the Batcave!
We haven't one moment to lose!

14:38.002 --> 14:39.458
Ahoy, Catwoman.

14:39.712 --> 14:44.627
How many times have I told you?
Never use my real name in public!

14:51.932 --> 14:55.220
You and your trained exploding shark!

14:55.436 --> 14:58.849
How should I know they'd have a can...

14:59.106 --> 15:03.566
...of shark-repellent Bat spray?
You sniveling sardine!

15:03.777 --> 15:06.268
You pompous puffed-up penguin!

15:06.530 --> 15:11.524
Friends, make peace.
Have a shake on me.

15:12.786 --> 15:15.277
A joke a day keeps the gloom away!

15:15.748 --> 15:18.956
Sic them, Hecate,
scratch out their eyes.

15:20.085 --> 15:25.000
-Take away that ravenous panther!
-|'|| feed him to the birds.

15:25.257 --> 15:28.044
I'll incapacitate it
with my trick confetti!

15:28.302 --> 15:32.420
"United Underworld."
We're about as united...

15:32.640 --> 15:36.178
...as the members
of the United World headquarters.

15:36.435 --> 15:39.518
-What's the matter with you all?
-She's right.

15:39.730 --> 15:44.690
If we don't manage to swallow
our super-criminal pride--

15:44.902 --> 15:47.689
Right, Mr. Riddler, quite right!

15:47.947 --> 15:51.531
We must hang together,
or we shall hang separately.

15:52.284 --> 15:57.654
What a pity that would be on the eve
of the greatest criminal coup ever!

15:57.873 --> 16:03.368
-How did it go, Catwoman?
-Perfectly. Perfectly.

16:04.129 --> 16:09.465
In my disguise as Kitka,
I penetrated their press conference.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.085
-The fools are completely baffled.
-But undrowned.

16:13.347 --> 16:16.180
Yes, unfortunately.

16:16.392 --> 16:19.930
Batman's boots didn't even look damp!

16:21.146 --> 16:24.058
Our prisoner still doesn't know
he's kidnapped?

16:24.274 --> 16:28.017
He just keeps ringing for his tea.

16:28.237 --> 16:30.102
[BELL RINGS]

16:30.322 --> 16:34.406
-There he goes again.
PENGUIN: Take it to him, man.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.450
[FOG HORN BLOWS]

16:42.376 --> 16:43.582
[KNOCKING]

16:43.794 --> 16:45.580
Come in.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.917
Your tea, commodore.

16:49.174 --> 16:53.258
Thank you, steward.
Good service aboard this yacht.

16:53.470 --> 16:56.837
We strive to give satisfaction, sir.

16:57.057 --> 17:00.174
Your face has the most ghastly pallor.

17:00.394 --> 17:02.851
Are you getting enough sea air?

17:03.105 --> 17:06.063
My duties keep me mostly undercover.

17:06.275 --> 17:07.936
Too bad.

17:08.193 --> 17:12.357
How much longer will this yacht
be fogbound off the Grand Banks?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.776
I couldn't say, sir.

17:15.451 --> 17:18.989
Well, gives me a chance
to catch up on my Dickens.

17:19.788 --> 17:22.120
Still, I'd like to get to Gotham City.

17:22.583 --> 17:27.122
I've a clever invention with me,
stored down in the hold.

17:27.379 --> 17:31.042
Should be worth
millions of dollars, pip-pip!

17:31.633 --> 17:37.094
Well, pip-pip to you, sir! If you
wish anything further, just ring!

17:39.725 --> 17:41.932
[FOG HORN BLOWS]

17:48.776 --> 17:51.267
[FOG HORN BLOWS]

17:53.322 --> 17:56.064
Schmidlapp's invention in our hands...

17:56.325 --> 18:01.035
...the whole world almost literally
in our grasp!

18:01.246 --> 18:06.081
And Batman and Robin
still alive tO block us.

18:06.877 --> 18:10.495
Everything pip-pip with
the prisoner! Hasn't a clue.

18:10.714 --> 18:12.955
-I bet the Dynamic Duo has.
-What?

18:13.175 --> 18:15.882
A clue on how we made
that ship disappear.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.883
-And when they solve it--
-They'll be out to investigate.

18:20.140 --> 18:24.008
But we'll be there first.
If we hurry, that is.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.095
Catwoman, you tend
to this headquarters.

18:27.314 --> 18:31.102
-Attention, you unfathomable finks!
-YO-hO!

18:31.318 --> 18:34.731
Call down to
our secret river-bottom dock.

18:34.988 --> 18:37.525
-Prepare our submarine for sea.
-YO-hO!

18:37.741 --> 18:40.073
-YO-hO what?
-Sir!

18:44.164 --> 18:48.828
Holy Merlin magician!
Get set for a shock.

18:50.295 --> 18:53.253
The Batcamera was aimed at the yacht.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.957
BATMAN: My hunch was right.
-I don't get it--

18:57.219 --> 19:00.336
Think! As you remarked,
no one can make...

19:00.556 --> 19:03.468
...a seagoing vessel
simply disappear.

19:03.725 --> 19:08.185
Provided it was ever
really there at all.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.558
-You mean--?
-Precisely!

19:10.774 --> 19:14.813
The yacht we thought we saw
was a mere illusion.

19:15.070 --> 19:19.530
A tricky projection akin
to the common desert mirage.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.240
It deceived our naked eyes...

19:22.494 --> 19:25.611
...but was blocked
by the Batcamera's Batfilter!

19:25.873 --> 19:28.330
I know where
that projection came from.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.994
-Observe that bell buoy.
ROBIN: What about it?

19:33.213 --> 19:38.003
The coordinates Of our position
were 10.3 by 69-8.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.595
Feed those figures into
the navigational aid computer.

19:40.804 --> 19:42.260
Roger.

19:51.398 --> 19:54.390
NO legal bell buoy at that position.

19:54.651 --> 19:58.940
As I surmised, an illegal projection
buoy cleverly camouflaged.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.442
Maybe the crooks left fingerprints!

20:01.700 --> 20:06.194
Good thinking, let's find out.
To the Batboat, fast!

21:01.426 --> 21:04.133
-One thing I don't dig, Batman.
-Oh?

21:04.763 --> 21:08.096
If that ship was a mirage,
where's the real one?

21:08.308 --> 21:13.598
Taken tO some secret island hideaway
with every soul aboard, save one.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.107
-CommOdore Schmidlapp?
-Precisely.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.816
For some reason
the hijackers needed him...

21:20.028 --> 21:24.192
...Or his invention
as part of their criminal scheme.

21:27.661 --> 21:31.404
Keep an eye on the scope.
Watch for suspicious vessels.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.872
It looks like we've got
the whole ocean to ourselves.

21:50.642 --> 21:53.759
Diving planes, Mr. Bluebeard,
three degrees.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.515
Hoist three degrees.

21:55.772 --> 21:58.980
I hope you know
what you're doing, Penguin.

21:59.234 --> 22:04.024
Mr. Riddler, I ignore
your insipid insinuation, sir!

22:05.657 --> 22:08.649
Mr. Joker, you're leaning
on the control!

22:08.869 --> 22:11.906
Don't sound so bossy, if you please!

22:12.122 --> 22:13.862
As the poet says:

22:14.124 --> 22:19.039
"On land, you may command.
At sea, it is me!"

22:23.717 --> 22:29.087
Now hear this. This is your captain
speaking, my fine pinioned pirates.

22:29.348 --> 22:34.559
We're approaching the buoy.
There may be skullduggery ahead!

22:42.152 --> 22:44.939
MAN: Yo-ho!
-What? What?

22:45.197 --> 22:49.486
Unidentified small craft, bearing 113.

22:49.701 --> 22:54.070
Mr. Bluebeard, hold her steady!
Up periscope!

23:21.441 --> 23:25.184
Great quivering icebergs!
Just as I hoped.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.820
BATMAN:
Watch your step, Robin.

23:31.076 --> 23:35.069
An underwater shark cage.
The source Of that fish.

23:35.330 --> 23:39.164
What cruelty!
Stuffing a poor shark with deadly TNT!

23:39.418 --> 23:42.376
Nothing's sacred to those devils.

23:42.587 --> 23:45.169
Torpedoes! What are we waiting for?

23:45.382 --> 23:49.170
Chain Of command, Mr. Riddler.
The Penguin runs the ship.

23:49.386 --> 23:51.718
Mr. Joker.
Load the torpedo tubes!

23:51.930 --> 23:54.262
YO-hO!

23:56.476 --> 23:58.012
Load torpedo tubes!

24:01.982 --> 24:04.519
Salt and corrosion.

24:04.734 --> 24:09.524
The infamous old enemies of
the crime fighter. NO prints here.

24:10.574 --> 24:11.859
Look here, Batman.

24:17.247 --> 24:22.992
That tricky mirage projector
must be behind this plate.

24:26.673 --> 24:32.509
Wow! What a set of superpower lenses!
NO wonder we were fooled.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.597
Look, Robin.

24:39.936 --> 24:42.803
ROBIN: Holy Long John Silver!
A periscope!

24:43.482 --> 24:46.519
He spotted us! Set torpedoes
to automatic homing.

Attack them, you faltering fink!

How did it happen?

1:08:47.248 --> 1:08:50.285
Whoever dehydrated those pirates...

1:08:50.543 --> 1:08:55.503
...couldn't have foreseen their
rehydration with the heavy water...

1:08:55.756 --> 1:08:58.088
...we use to recharge
the atomic pile!

1:08:58.300 --> 1:09:01.292
It left them in an unstable condition!

1:09:01.512 --> 1:09:06.677
You saw it yourself. The slightest
impact was sufficient...

1:09:06.892 --> 1:09:10.680
...tO instantly reduce them
to antimatter.

1:09:11.188 --> 1:09:15.898

You mean, they won't be coming back?

NO, Robin. Not in this universe.

My apologies, commodore.
I've done you a cruel injustice.

-You have?
-You were duped. Brainwashed.

The criminals planted
those dehydrated thugs on you.

1:09:49.935 --> 1:09:52.517
You were obviously
under the influence...

...Of post-hypnotic suggestion
when you rehydrated them.

We'd better stop and check it.

-Sorry about that. Won't take long.
-Yes, you will!
