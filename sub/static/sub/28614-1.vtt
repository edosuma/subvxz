FRANCES (VOICEOVER):
People come visit here.

01:11.603 --> 01:14.604
They all say the same thing.

01:14.606 --> 01:17.176
It's so peaceful.

01:23.615 --> 01:24.714
Of course, people
don't ever really

01:24.716 --> 01:27.584
say what they're thinking.

01:27.586 --> 01:34.792
If they did, they'd say, shit.

01:34.794 --> 01:39.596
It doesn't matter what the
hell we do here on this earth.

01:39.598 --> 01:41.601
It will keep going
with or without us.

01:47.639 --> 01:52.042
And maybe that's what
it comes down to.

01:52.044 --> 01:57.949
In a world where the only
constants are time and loss,

01:57.951 --> 02:01.819
and the only true
choice left to us is who

02:01.821 --> 02:03.256
we choose to have alongside.

02:28.714 --> 02:29.847
NEWSCASTER (ON
TV): Our top story.

02:29.849 --> 02:32.949
Wild ride on Wall Street
continues Thursday with the Dow

02:32.951 --> 02:35.853
Jones Industrial Average
plunging more than 200 points

02:35.855 --> 02:37.854
for the fourth time this year.

02:37.856 --> 02:41.025
In local news, area farmers
were counting on an increased

02:41.027 --> 02:43.160
productivity to
meet rising demand,

02:43.162 --> 02:44.164
but a recent study noted...

03:19.866 --> 03:22.133
Great.

03:22.135 --> 03:23.737
[music playing]

03:29.008 --> 03:35.780
(SINGING) Ain't nothing
gonna go but you're a shock.

03:35.782 --> 03:38.948
Just a science cloud.

03:38.950 --> 03:41.718
- Go ahead and bring you down.
- Hey cowboy.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.220
Yeah?

03:43.222 --> 03:45.222
[inaudible] your
birthday party.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.990
(SINGING) Before
it's way too late.

03:46.992 --> 03:48.192
Wait.

03:48.194 --> 03:51.461
Your black society.

03:51.463 --> 03:54.465
Your black society.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.133
Your black society.

03:57.135 --> 04:01.307
Don't let 'em change your...
LIAM: Mom.

04:04.476 --> 04:06.210
Sorry, baby.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.111
OK.

04:08.113 --> 04:09.180
First day of school.

04:09.182 --> 04:11.250
You are going to look so nice.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.721
You know Abbey saw that.

04:18.724 --> 04:20.923
Well, a cheat begets
a cheat, little brother.

04:20.926 --> 04:23.296
I do not understand
your relationship.

04:26.799 --> 04:28.131
You find this funny, Ray?

04:28.133 --> 04:31.368
Can I see that?

04:31.370 --> 04:33.470
You do this again?

04:33.472 --> 04:36.239
You know, if you spend
less time investigating me

04:36.241 --> 04:39.844
and more time
investigating Frances,

04:39.846 --> 04:42.011
you might find yourself having
a bit more fun there, cowboy.

04:42.013 --> 04:42.715
Woo.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.486
Norm.

04:48.488 --> 04:49.119
Thank you.

04:49.121 --> 04:51.255
Hey.

04:51.257 --> 04:52.123
Norm.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.758
Come on, man.

04:53.760 --> 04:54.958
Hey, guess who
just got uninvited

04:54.960 --> 04:55.695
for my birthday party.

04:59.030 --> 04:59.999
Your brother is an asshole.

05:04.436 --> 05:06.205
- Is your dad up?
- Yeah.

05:16.948 --> 05:17.984
Here, take the damn thing.

05:22.320 --> 05:23.287
OK, come on.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.188
You're OK, Daddy.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.289
Let's get this on you.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.426
I'll do it myself here.

05:29.428 --> 05:30.430
FRANCES: Breakfast is ready.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.201
Uh, sir.

05:38.203 --> 05:42.438
Do you know that antenna
came off your Pop's old 3100.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.941
That was a solid truck.

05:44.943 --> 05:48.311
He had that truck
before he had you.

05:48.313 --> 05:51.314
Hell, he came riding
in on that truck when

05:51.316 --> 05:53.284
he came here looking for a job.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.350
That truck killed
him too, you know.

05:54.352 --> 05:55.820
Slid right off the ice.

05:55.822 --> 05:56.554
I know, sir.

05:56.556 --> 05:57.854
You guys hear me?

05:57.856 --> 06:00.457
Neighbors heard you.

06:00.459 --> 06:01.958
Hey, Norman.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.494
Morning, Frances.

06:03.496 --> 06:04.195
Liam.

06:04.197 --> 06:04.898
Hey.

06:08.568 --> 06:10.234
You staying for breakfast?

06:10.236 --> 06:11.035
I can't.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.169
Got work.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.838
Guess we'll be seeing you
tonight at Ray's birthday.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.039
Yes, ma'am.

06:16.041 --> 06:19.342
I'll make sure
Fran wears her dress.

06:19.344 --> 06:19.979
OK.

06:41.433 --> 06:45.369
SHERIFF: What you
got there, deputy?

06:45.371 --> 06:49.006
24 feet, six inches.

06:49.008 --> 06:50.373
You say 24 six.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.174
Yes, sir.

06:51.176 --> 06:52.609
24-6.

06:52.611 --> 06:54.410
Right there it is, ain't it?

06:54.412 --> 06:57.047
Your county starts
south of Am Road.

06:57.049 --> 06:58.648
Looks like it's on yours, Ed.

06:58.650 --> 07:01.085
And here I thought since your
county pays to maintain it,

07:01.087 --> 07:01.887
the road belongs to you.

07:09.594 --> 07:11.160
SHERIFF: There it
is right there.

07:11.162 --> 07:12.462
That's the road we on.
That's the road.

07:12.464 --> 07:14.664
That's a river.

07:14.666 --> 07:16.165
The river?

07:16.167 --> 07:20.436
On maps, rivers are
blue, much like in life,

07:20.438 --> 07:23.640
unless you're in Texas,

07:23.642 --> 07:27.578
Thing is my
coroner's on vacation.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.080
Ain't got nobody
to do an autopsy.

07:30.082 --> 07:32.349
Blackwood County mandates
anybody dies under 40

07:32.351 --> 07:33.183
- got to have an autopsy.
- All right.

07:33.185 --> 07:34.585
- You know that, Eddy.
- All right.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.352
All right.

07:36.354 --> 07:38.554
Have your grandson load the
bodies in the back of my truck.

07:38.556 --> 07:43.059
In the back of my truck, not
the cab like the last time.

07:43.061 --> 07:44.628
You got it.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.563
You want me to call
the coroner's office?

07:46.565 --> 07:47.931
No.

07:47.933 --> 07:48.934
Cause of death
is loss of life.

07:59.044 --> 08:01.611
Let's get you tucked in.

08:01.613 --> 08:02.578
OK.

08:02.580 --> 08:06.417
There we go.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.217
Mom.

08:07.219 --> 08:08.018
Yeah?

08:08.020 --> 08:12.155
You going to get
drunk as a pig?

08:12.157 --> 08:14.290
- Who'd you learn that?
- Grandpa.

08:14.292 --> 08:19.696
That's what he says every time
you go out with Uncle Ray.

08:19.698 --> 08:21.297
I don't want you saying
those things to me, OK?

08:21.299 --> 08:22.099
OK.

08:22.101 --> 08:22.535
Sorry.

08:25.471 --> 08:27.207
You know you're my
one true man, right?

08:33.544 --> 08:36.412
I love you, babe.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.380
OK.

08:37.381 --> 08:38.481
Are you ready?

08:38.482 --> 08:39.349
Yeah.

08:39.351 --> 08:39.986
Would you hurry up.

08:45.156 --> 08:47.059
OK.
Now let's see the other side.

08:50.996 --> 08:53.629
He likes you.

08:53.631 --> 08:55.367
I don't want to like him.

08:56.399 --> 08:56.633
Why not?

08:56.635 --> 08:59.402
Because look at you ad Ray
always fighting and cheating.

08:59.404 --> 09:00.771
It's bullshit.

09:00.773 --> 09:01.504
Ow.

09:01.506 --> 09:02.976
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that hurt?

09:07.413 --> 09:08.144
I don't know.

09:08.146 --> 09:09.146
He's changed.

09:09.148 --> 09:11.715
It's like ever since he
came back from service,

09:11.717 --> 09:14.484
become a mute.

09:14.486 --> 09:17.991
It's good, you know,
letting somebody love you.

09:35.607 --> 09:38.207
Well, look at you.

09:38.209 --> 09:40.145
You might still have a
chance at a normal life.

09:44.283 --> 09:46.219
You really do look beautiful.

09:49.487 --> 09:50.189
Thank you.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.726
ABBEY: Come on.
The boys are waiting.

09:56.728 --> 09:58.731
[music playing]

10:07.840 --> 10:09.109
What is it about El Camino?

10:12.211 --> 10:16.513
What draws you to her?

10:16.515 --> 10:20.383
What draws you to Cinch?

10:20.385 --> 10:23.119
Maybe she has
something I don't,

10:23.121 --> 10:28.591
like gonorrhea or the herpes.

10:28.593 --> 10:31.762
Or maybe she knows
how to shoot a gun,

10:31.764 --> 10:33.696
or wears [inaudible].

10:33.698 --> 10:34.366
You're an asshole.

10:39.838 --> 10:40.606
Some sideshow, huh?

10:46.478 --> 10:48.313
I was kind of hugging you'd
get your handcuffs back.

10:52.117 --> 10:53.419
Yeah.
I need 'em for work.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.695
Fine.

11:04.697 --> 11:07.130
I want you to teach me to shoot.

11:07.132 --> 11:07.766
I'm not kidding.

11:11.403 --> 11:13.402
Well, then, baby,
I'm going to need

11:13.404 --> 11:16.806
my hands if I'm going to
teach you how to shoot a gun.

11:16.808 --> 11:17.577
Keep dancing, cowboy.

11:30.722 --> 11:33.824
I'm going to go.

11:33.826 --> 11:35.893
Thanks for the drink.

11:35.895 --> 11:36.529
Was it something I said?

11:39.365 --> 11:41.731
No.

11:41.733 --> 11:42.634
No.
I'm just tired.

11:45.404 --> 11:46.472
Make sure Abbey gets home, OK?

11:52.211 --> 11:55.546
Frances, just hold on a sec.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.247
What?

11:57.249 --> 12:00.216
Did you want to dance?

12:00.218 --> 12:01.851
- Norman.
- I'm sorry.

12:01.853 --> 12:07.257
Just... I'm just not good
with this kind of stuff.

12:07.259 --> 12:10.194
What stuff?

12:10.196 --> 12:13.196
You know, romantic gestures.

12:13.198 --> 12:15.267
You don't have to be Don Juan.

12:18.437 --> 12:21.404
We used to talk, Norman.

12:21.406 --> 12:23.840
Even when you went away,
we talked on the phone.

12:23.842 --> 12:24.575
We...

12:24.577 --> 12:26.542
I know.

12:26.544 --> 12:28.244
I know.

12:28.246 --> 12:31.949
I just come back and I see
my brother and your sister.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.486
I don't want to to be us.

12:41.526 --> 12:42.792
Yeah.

12:42.794 --> 12:45.595
[chatter]

12:45.597 --> 12:46.231
Ray.

12:48.967 --> 12:50.870
I been fucking Abbey.

12:53.972 --> 12:55.471
What the hell is going on?

12:55.473 --> 12:57.541
These assholes are
talking shit on Abbey.

12:57.543 --> 12:58.477
Let's go.
Come on.

13:01.779 --> 13:03.680
You want to spend
another night in jail?

13:03.682 --> 13:04.317
Huh?

13:08.621 --> 13:09.753
OK.

13:09.755 --> 13:12.955
Everyone, just relax.

13:12.957 --> 13:15.691
Hun, uncuff me.

13:15.693 --> 13:16.659
NORMAN: Son of a...

13:16.661 --> 13:19.396
Uncuff me.

13:19.398 --> 13:20.696
Honey.

13:20.698 --> 13:22.666
Go get 'em.

13:22.668 --> 13:23.836
You son of a bitch.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.537
Come on.

13:28.539 --> 13:31.407
Let's go.

13:31.409 --> 13:32.276
Abbey.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.710
What?

13:33.712 --> 13:34.644
You're drunk.

13:34.646 --> 13:36.546
So?

13:36.548 --> 13:38.547
My earring.

13:38.549 --> 13:39.519
Jesus, Frances.
What...

13:56.034 --> 13:57.901
MAN: Hey, you think
you're special.

13:57.903 --> 13:58.801
Abbey!
MAN 2: Hey.

13:58.803 --> 13:59.672
Leave me alone.

14:02.707 --> 14:04.340
Abbey.

14:04.342 --> 14:06.810
Give me the keys.

14:06.812 --> 14:07.813
Abbey, give me the keys.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.648
I'm so sick of this bullshit.

14:12.650 --> 14:14.984
Then keep out of it.

14:14.986 --> 14:15.621
Move on.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.760
What would you know
about being with someone?

14:31.904 --> 14:33.573
Abbey, come...
Abbey!

14:49.621 --> 14:51.721
RAY: Whose side are you on?

14:51.723 --> 14:53.657
You already got two priors,
Ray, both through fighting.

14:53.659 --> 14:55.091
What if someone would
have pressed charges?

14:55.093 --> 14:57.027
Oh, you wanted to
get your ass kicked?

14:57.029 --> 14:58.061
Huh?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.696
I can look after myself, Ray.

14:59.698 --> 15:00.830
Oh yeah?

15:00.832 --> 15:03.099
I'm still drunk and I can
still kick your ass, bro.

15:03.101 --> 15:06.136
[inaudible]
All right.

15:06.138 --> 15:07.704
All right.
All right.

15:07.706 --> 15:08.705
All right.

15:08.707 --> 15:09.739
All right.

15:09.741 --> 15:12.808
All right.

15:12.810 --> 15:13.744
Damn it.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.713
Son of a bitch.

15:20.952 --> 15:22.518
Hey.

15:22.520 --> 15:22.954
Look at this.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.624
It's for the trailer.

15:28.626 --> 15:30.793
I got it engraved
and everything.

15:30.795 --> 15:31.862
Our trailer?

15:31.864 --> 15:32.963
Our trailer.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.334
It's for Abbey.

15:37.602 --> 15:38.770
What do you think?

15:42.540 --> 15:46.843
Make sure she
doesn't make a mess.

15:46.845 --> 15:48.912
Sweet though.

15:48.914 --> 15:52.047
Thought I'd try not to
make a mess before I wed.

15:52.049 --> 15:53.783
I need a place to
fuck in the trailer.

15:53.785 --> 15:55.985
Not in my room.

15:55.987 --> 15:58.522
You got a bigger bed.

15:58.524 --> 16:01.157
And your sheets
are always clean.

16:01.159 --> 16:02.562
[inaudible].

16:06.130 --> 16:09.534
[music playing]

16:48.874 --> 16:51.874
Hey.

16:51.876 --> 16:53.042
Hey.

16:53.044 --> 16:56.745
- I got a surprise for you.
- Yeah?

16:56.747 --> 16:57.214
Yeah.

16:57.216 --> 16:59.215
What is it?

16:59.217 --> 17:03.552
If you want to see,
you got to come with me.

17:03.554 --> 17:06.055
Babe, I"m tired.

17:06.057 --> 17:08.656
I'm hungover.

17:08.659 --> 17:11.196
I'm even drunk at the same time.

17:18.169 --> 17:20.136
Come on then.

17:20.137 --> 17:22.070
It's still dark out.

17:22.073 --> 17:23.542
Are you a cowboy or what?

17:30.548 --> 17:33.218
[music playing]

18:01.246 --> 18:04.680
What the hell are you doing?

18:04.682 --> 18:06.882
I told you I want you
to teach me how to shoot.

18:06.884 --> 18:08.083
And where'd you
get that thing?

18:08.085 --> 18:09.785
Took it from my
daddy's office.

18:09.787 --> 18:11.588
Jesus Christ.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.590
- And what if he finds out?
- He won't.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.992
I've never in my entire life
seen him take it out, OK?

18:15.994 --> 18:17.593
No one saw me.

18:17.595 --> 18:18.529
Relax.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.996
Well, I ain't teaching
you how to shoot.

18:20.998 --> 18:21.898
- Why not?
- Because.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.599
Why not?

18:23.601 --> 18:25.569
Because you like dressing
up in makeup, and earrings,

18:25.571 --> 18:27.036
and all that kind of stuff.

18:27.038 --> 18:28.972
Why do you want to learn
how to shoot anyway?

18:28.974 --> 18:31.006
You're a girly girl.

18:31.008 --> 18:32.676
Oh, and El Camino
is a real woman?

18:32.678 --> 18:33.877
Oh Jesus Christ.

18:33.879 --> 18:35.811
What she hold a gun in hand,
and a wrench in the other,

18:35.813 --> 18:36.946
and a long neck
between her tits?

18:36.948 --> 18:38.583
Would you watch what
you're doing with that thing.

18:47.758 --> 18:49.959
At least Cinch isn't afraid
to tell me he loves me.

18:49.961 --> 18:50.961
Oh, that's some bullshit.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.163
You believe him?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.063
What do you think?

18:54.065 --> 18:55.665
I don't know.

18:55.667 --> 18:56.666
You fall for any guy that
sells you the love line.

18:56.668 --> 18:58.334
I mean, it worked for
Liam's daddy, didn't it?

18:58.336 --> 19:00.605
Don't you dare bring my
son into your bullshit, Ray.

19:04.109 --> 19:07.243
Where are we going?

19:07.245 --> 19:09.678
Somewhere I can
shoot something.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.813
Darling, stay...

19:10.815 --> 19:12.081
- Don't call me stupid.
- Will you just stop the car?

19:12.083 --> 19:13.382
- No.
- Stop the car.

19:13.384 --> 19:14.684
- Let go.
- Look, I heard you.

19:14.686 --> 19:15.318
I hate you, Ray.

19:15.320 --> 19:15.985
Let go.

19:15.987 --> 19:16.919
Ah!

19:16.921 --> 19:18.821
Damn it.

19:18.823 --> 19:19.888
What is wrong with you?

19:19.890 --> 19:21.724
You know what,
Ray, you're right.

19:21.726 --> 19:23.158
I do love him.

19:23.160 --> 19:25.160
I love that he
cares enough to lie.

19:25.162 --> 19:28.999
I love his stupid friends
And I love his damn cock.

19:29.001 --> 19:31.967
Ugh.
Fuck.

19:31.969 --> 19:32.604
Fuck.

19:40.946 --> 19:42.946
Oh God.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.113
Abbey.
Abbey.

19:44.115 --> 19:44.947
Abbey.

19:44.949 --> 19:46.882
Abbey.

19:46.884 --> 19:48.984
Baby, baby.
Abbey.

19:48.986 --> 19:50.219
Abbey.

19:50.221 --> 19:52.988
Abbey.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.424
Please be OK.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.129
Oh.
No.

20:15.846 --> 20:17.382
Come here, baby.

20:21.753 --> 20:22.252
OK.

20:22.254 --> 20:25.221
So help banana.

20:25.223 --> 20:27.756
And then... get Norm.

20:27.758 --> 20:31.160
I'll get Norm.

20:31.162 --> 20:36.065
I'm going to get
you that trail, OK?

20:36.067 --> 20:37.332
See this?

20:37.334 --> 20:39.401
See this?

20:39.403 --> 20:40.839
That's your key right there.

21:39.331 --> 21:40.330
Hey baby.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.031
I got you.

21:42.033 --> 21:42.999
I got you.

21:43.001 --> 21:44.300
I got you.

21:44.302 --> 21:45.301
Honey, I'm sorry.

21:45.303 --> 21:46.301
All right.

21:46.303 --> 21:47.302
Ready?

21:47.304 --> 21:50.208
[dark music]

21:54.979 --> 21:55.880
Very good.

22:01.285 --> 22:02.284
Oh, yeah.

22:02.286 --> 22:04.253
There you go.

22:04.255 --> 22:05.157
Hey, baby.

22:53.871 --> 22:55.807
- NORMAN (ON PHONE): Hello?
- Hey Norm.

23:01.345 --> 23:04.313
I fucked up.

23:04.315 --> 23:06.518
I fucked up really bad.

23:40.986 --> 23:42.487
Ray, what the hell is this?
You hurt?

23:49.026 --> 23:51.927
She wanted to
learn how to shoot.

23:51.929 --> 23:52.864
It was an accident.

23:56.601 --> 23:59.401
Jesus Christ.

23:59.403 --> 24:01.204
The gun just went off.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.906
It just fucking went off.

24:02.908 --> 24:05.675
OK.

24:05.677 --> 24:08.112
She was holding it and I tried
to get it out of her hand and...

24:12.650 --> 24:13.317
you believe me, don't you, Norm?

24:13.319 --> 24:15.855
It was... it was an accident.

24:25.095 --> 24:28.063
Where is she?

24:28.065 --> 24:29.634
I got rid of her.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.341
Jesus, Ray.

24:39.343 --> 24:40.609
What'd you...

24:40.611 --> 24:42.110
You believe me,
don't you, Norm?

24:42.112 --> 24:42.779
I swear to God.

24:42.781 --> 24:43.612
I swear it was an accident.

24:43.614 --> 24:47.183
It doesn't matter.
You moved her.

24:47.185 --> 24:47.884
You fucking moved her.

24:47.886 --> 24:49.551
And now it looks like murder.

24:49.553 --> 24:51.955
What was I supposed to do?

24:51.957 --> 24:52.722
I got two priors.

24:52.724 --> 24:54.293
Who'd believe me?
Huh?

24:58.330 --> 25:00.128
Yeah.

25:00.130 --> 25:00.565
Exactly.

25:06.670 --> 25:08.503
What do you want
me to do, Ray?

25:08.505 --> 25:10.676
You want me to lie for
you, say you weren't here?

25:13.678 --> 25:14.343
You asked me to come here.

25:14.345 --> 25:16.012
I'm here.

25:16.014 --> 25:17.714
Tell me exactly what
you want me to do.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.715
I don't know.

25:19.717 --> 25:22.685
Yes, you do.

25:22.687 --> 25:24.686
- I don't know.
- Yes, you do.

25:24.688 --> 25:26.121
I want you to say it.
It's important.

25:26.123 --> 25:27.322
Say what?

25:27.324 --> 25:28.491
What it is you want me to do.

25:28.493 --> 25:31.194
Why?

25:31.196 --> 25:33.663
Because it's important, Ray.

25:33.665 --> 25:36.465
It's important.

25:36.467 --> 25:38.036
I want you to help
me cover this up.

25:41.406 --> 25:42.272
That what I want you to do.

25:42.274 --> 25:45.675
I want you to help
me cover this up.

25:45.677 --> 25:48.280
Please, Norm, I'm
begging you please.

26:02.427 --> 26:03.294
Come on, boy.

26:08.332 --> 26:09.098
Where's your sister?

26:09.100 --> 26:10.269
I don't know.

26:14.538 --> 26:15.370
What's wrong, honey?

26:15.372 --> 26:18.608
- I want the frosted cereal.
- OK.

26:18.610 --> 26:19.645
You ain't his mama.

26:25.082 --> 26:26.482
[knocking]

26:26.484 --> 26:29.351
FRANCES: Abbey, wake up.

26:29.353 --> 26:30.054
Abbey.

26:40.465 --> 26:41.300
PATTY (ON RADIO):
Norm, you there?

26:44.835 --> 26:48.571
Come in, Norman.

26:48.573 --> 26:49.707
Go ahead, Patty.

26:52.811 --> 26:54.676
PATTY (ON RADIO): Just got
a call for an abandoned

26:54.678 --> 26:57.612
car up by Lake Sherburne.

26:57.614 --> 26:59.749
Man said he just
came upon it sitting

26:59.751 --> 27:00.386
in the middle of the road.

27:05.556 --> 27:08.824
You call a tow truck?

27:08.826 --> 27:10.194
PATTY (ON RADIO): Caller
says there's blood in it.

27:18.369 --> 27:20.205
I should probably wake
the sheriff for this.

27:22.841 --> 27:24.176
Probably should then.

28:12.189 --> 28:12.623
Sheriff.

28:15.826 --> 28:18.194
That's Abbey Campbell's car?

28:18.196 --> 28:20.463
Yes, sir.

28:20.465 --> 28:23.135
Radioed Patty about five minutes
ago to ask Tom if Abbey's home.

28:32.310 --> 28:34.776
Son, I think I should
take this by myself.

28:34.778 --> 28:38.214
If it's all the same to
you, sir, Abbey's family.

28:38.216 --> 28:39.751
What this is, I'd like
to see it through.

28:42.786 --> 28:45.521
Boys, bring Axel and Cesar up.

28:45.523 --> 28:47.689
I want you to work these
woods about 100 yards out.

28:47.691 --> 28:51.162
The lake is down there
about 200 yards if need be.

29:00.772 --> 29:02.705
Well, she rolled to a stop.

29:02.707 --> 29:03.408
Didn't touch the brakes.

29:11.248 --> 29:13.217
This is where the
bullet come out.

29:16.955 --> 29:18.256
It was fired from the inside.

29:21.292 --> 29:22.461
I guess not.

29:34.772 --> 29:36.705
So what, she's driving
along and she...

29:36.707 --> 29:39.407
she stops because she
sees someone she knows.

29:39.409 --> 29:41.412
And they come around the side
of the car and then she... no.

29:44.415 --> 29:45.918
Why would anybody be
standing out here?

29:51.688 --> 29:52.356
This is some bullshit.

29:55.959 --> 29:57.196
That is some bullshit.

30:11.909 --> 30:15.744
There are six sets
of prints here.

30:15.746 --> 30:18.414
And two of them ain't human.

30:18.416 --> 30:22.350
Me, you, two barking
boys and their dogs?

30:22.352 --> 30:24.552
Whoever did this, they
traded in their legs

30:24.554 --> 30:26.289
for a set of wings and
they just flew around.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.055
They never touched down.

30:27.057 --> 30:29.792
They didn't put a pinky down.

30:29.794 --> 30:30.428
Not a pinky.

30:41.471 --> 30:42.373
PATTY (ON RADIO): Ed, Norman?

30:47.644 --> 30:49.844
This is Ed.

30:49.846 --> 30:52.648
PATTY (ON RADIO): Ed, Tom
said that Abbey's not at home.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.151
Tom says that her
bed is still made up.

30:58.022 --> 30:58.657
Thanks, Patty.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.591
Right.

31:02.593 --> 31:03.892
We better get up to the house
and put together a timeline.

31:03.894 --> 31:05.494
Are you OK with this?

31:05.496 --> 31:05.930
Yes, sir.

31:49.439 --> 31:51.741
Car's just off the lake.

31:51.743 --> 31:55.878
It's cold so it's been
there a few hours at least.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.414
Those are Abbey's keys.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.082
Look, right now
she's just not home.

32:01.084 --> 32:03.084
That's all.

32:03.086 --> 32:04.455
She could be out with friends.

32:07.492 --> 32:10.592
We need to ask you
all some questions.

32:10.594 --> 32:13.763
Did anybody see Abbey
come home last night?

32:13.765 --> 32:15.398
No.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.166
When was the last
time you saw her?

32:17.168 --> 32:18.967
Last night at
the Whispering Pig.

32:18.969 --> 32:20.770
What time?

32:20.772 --> 32:23.773
About midnight.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.108
We left the bar and I
went on ahead myself.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.676
I forgot she had a car with her.

32:28.678 --> 32:30.980
By the time I looked back, she
was driving off the other way.

32:30.982 --> 32:32.715
Was she with anyone?

32:32.717 --> 32:33.215
No.

32:33.217 --> 32:34.984
I don't think so.

32:34.986 --> 32:37.653
ED: You're not certain?

32:37.655 --> 32:38.090
She was alone.

32:40.992 --> 32:42.457
Any idea where she was headed?

32:42.459 --> 32:42.957
No.

32:42.959 --> 32:43.961
She was drunk.

32:48.032 --> 32:51.567
I tried to stop her.

32:51.569 --> 32:53.101
Why did you walk on
ahead back to the ranch?

32:53.103 --> 32:55.571
Why didn't you get a ride?

32:55.573 --> 32:57.973
I was mad at
her for something.

32:57.975 --> 32:59.742
Girl stuff.

32:59.744 --> 33:03.678
Few of the guys said some
words about Abbey at the Pig.

33:03.680 --> 33:05.080
Ray and them got into it.

33:05.082 --> 33:07.582
I tried to stop it.

33:07.584 --> 33:09.118
Anything serious?

33:09.120 --> 33:12.120
Nothing out of the ordinary.

33:12.122 --> 33:14.990
What did you and
Ray do after the bar?

33:14.992 --> 33:17.496
We went home, went to
bed, woke up this morning.

33:21.765 --> 33:26.569
Ray had a flat though,
puncture on the left side.

33:26.571 --> 33:29.006
So I took him to Hank's to
get a new one about 9:30.

33:34.144 --> 33:36.911
Are Ray and
Abbey still dating?

33:36.913 --> 33:38.981
Who can keep track?

33:38.983 --> 33:41.484
They're on and off.

33:41.486 --> 33:44.619
She's been with Cinch
half the nights last week.

33:44.621 --> 33:46.589
What is Cinch's last name?

33:46.591 --> 33:48.624
Cinch... damn it.

33:48.626 --> 33:49.757
They always run
out the wrong time.

33:49.759 --> 33:52.127
You got a pen?

33:52.129 --> 33:52.898
I'll get one from the cruiser.

34:14.985 --> 34:16.851
Just fucking tell him.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.588
Just fucking tell him.

34:19.590 --> 34:21.458
Just fucking tell him.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.399
Sheriff's department.

36:44.401 --> 36:45.934
Sheriff's department.

36:45.936 --> 36:47.970
Hello.

36:47.972 --> 36:48.671
Whoa.

36:48.673 --> 36:51.140
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, whoa.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.274
Is that you, Riley?

36:53.276 --> 36:55.077
Thought you were dead.

36:55.079 --> 36:55.977
I'm not.

36:55.979 --> 36:57.079
That's good.

36:57.081 --> 37:00.816
I suppose so.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.216
I need to talk to
you about something.

37:02.218 --> 37:04.285
Out with it then.

37:04.287 --> 37:09.457
There is a young girl
died over here by the lake.

37:09.459 --> 37:11.392
What time did you
hear the gunshot?

37:11.394 --> 37:13.961
RILEY JENKINS: Around about
6:00, 6:15 in the morning.

37:13.963 --> 37:15.363
Just one gunshot?

37:15.365 --> 37:17.999
That's right.

37:18.001 --> 37:20.803
Did you, uh, come outside,
look out the window?

37:20.805 --> 37:22.704
What for?

37:22.706 --> 37:25.039
Well, to see if
everything was OK.

37:25.041 --> 37:26.742
I was OK.

37:26.744 --> 37:29.845
To see what the
shot was about?

37:29.847 --> 37:31.412
Shots going off all
the time around here.

37:31.414 --> 37:35.249
People hunt.
They hunting all kind of things.

37:35.251 --> 37:37.753
Anything else?

37:37.755 --> 37:38.854
Yeah.

37:38.856 --> 37:42.758
About an hour later, I heard
voices and a big crash.

37:42.760 --> 37:44.325
A crash like a car accident?

37:44.327 --> 37:45.260
No.

37:45.262 --> 37:46.829
Not like a car accident.

37:46.831 --> 37:50.499
More like glass breaking.

37:50.501 --> 37:52.968
And what about the voices?

37:52.970 --> 37:54.303
Male voices.

37:54.305 --> 37:56.305
Voices plural?

37:56.307 --> 37:57.439
What's plural?

37:57.441 --> 37:59.006
More than one.

37:59.008 --> 38:00.108
Yeah.

38:00.110 --> 38:01.977
Plural.

38:01.979 --> 38:03.144
But I didn't make
out what they were

38:03.146 --> 38:06.048
saying so don't go on asking
me what they were saying.

38:06.050 --> 38:06.751
Thank you.

38:11.055 --> 38:13.354
We good?

38:13.356 --> 38:14.726
[car horn]

38:22.032 --> 38:22.734
Hey, Cinch.

38:28.238 --> 38:30.340
Word has it that she was headed
north when she left the bar.

38:33.543 --> 38:35.179
That's your direction, ain't it?

38:40.416 --> 38:41.350
Where'd you go after the bar?

38:41.352 --> 38:44.119
Where were you between
12:00 and 8:00 AM?

38:44.121 --> 38:45.320
- Trying to pin this on me?
- No.

38:45.322 --> 38:46.521
I'm just trying to get
the story straight.

38:46.523 --> 38:47.923
You know, I'll tell you what.

38:47.925 --> 38:49.124
I left the bar
with Shane and Fred

38:49.126 --> 38:50.925
here, went back to my house.

38:50.927 --> 38:53.162
That's where we stayed until
I showed back up at work neck

38:53.164 --> 38:53.798
morning.

38:56.800 --> 38:58.934
Yo sweetie, you got
to talk to Norman here

38:58.936 --> 39:01.439
whose shithead brother was
sugar sweet on dear Abbey.

39:05.876 --> 39:08.209
I don't know what
happened to Abbey.

39:08.211 --> 39:09.443
I know what you
got on your hands

39:09.445 --> 39:10.081
is a conflict of interest.

39:14.985 --> 39:16.854
I gotta get back to work.

39:27.597 --> 39:29.398
He's in love.

39:29.400 --> 39:30.499
With Abbey?

39:30.501 --> 39:31.934
Yeah, with Abbey.

39:31.936 --> 39:34.001
He sure has a hell
of a way of showing it.

39:34.003 --> 39:35.537
Yeah, well, he may act
all tough and hard,

39:35.539 --> 39:37.472
but I'll tell you
what, what's true

39:37.474 --> 39:40.175
about all men is they're
flesh and blood and most of us

39:40.177 --> 39:43.378
are full of shit.

39:43.380 --> 39:46.615
Look, uh, why don't you
head back to the ranch?

39:46.617 --> 39:47.448
I'd like to stay on if you...

39:47.450 --> 39:48.383
I do mind.

39:48.385 --> 39:49.517
Cinch is right.

39:49.519 --> 39:50.852
You're too close to this.

39:50.854 --> 39:54.923
And besides, don't look right.

39:54.925 --> 39:55.791
So go on.

39:55.793 --> 39:58.559
I'm sure your family's
waiting for you.

39:58.561 --> 39:59.197
OK.

40:13.209 --> 40:17.144
PASTOR: He leadeth me in
the paths of righteousness

40:17.146 --> 40:18.646
for his namesake.

40:18.648 --> 40:23.084
Yea though I walk in the
valley of the shadow of death,

40:23.086 --> 40:24.956
I will fear no evil.

40:37.001 --> 40:38.200
Thank you for coming.

40:38.202 --> 40:40.602
We really appreciate it.

40:40.604 --> 40:42.204
Still not [inaudible]

40:42.206 --> 40:44.338
Can you move?

40:44.340 --> 40:46.908
Excuse me.

40:46.910 --> 40:47.378
Would you watch him?

40:53.383 --> 40:56.151
What are you doing?

40:56.153 --> 40:58.053
What does it look like?

40:58.055 --> 40:59.053
Three years down
the drain and you

40:59.055 --> 41:00.555
want to throw it all away now?

41:00.557 --> 41:03.258
It ain't been three years.

41:03.260 --> 41:06.061
God damn it.

41:06.063 --> 41:07.428
What a man does
in his own home...

41:07.430 --> 41:09.330
Hey Liam.
TOM: ...is his own business.

41:09.332 --> 41:11.133
You want to play a game?

41:11.135 --> 41:12.501
Yeah.

41:12.503 --> 41:13.403
Ah, come on.

41:17.474 --> 41:18.176
Damn it.

41:21.945 --> 41:23.413
Abbey never treated me this way.

41:26.483 --> 41:27.385
Well, Abbey's not here.

41:39.630 --> 41:41.629
Hey, you're
pretty good at this.

41:41.631 --> 41:42.934
A regular shark.

41:45.702 --> 41:47.501
Uncle Ray.

41:47.503 --> 41:49.004
Yeah?

41:49.006 --> 41:51.707
I know why my mom died.

41:51.709 --> 41:52.341
RAY:

41:52.343 --> 41:55.410
You do?

41:55.412 --> 42:01.316
Three days ago, I wanted to go
get ice cream, but she said no.

42:01.318 --> 42:03.651
Said she promised.

42:03.653 --> 42:06.722
She said she was too
busy so I started crying.

42:06.724 --> 42:09.291
And I told her I hated her.

42:09.293 --> 42:13.227
So she got really mad and
told me to go to my room.

42:13.229 --> 42:18.936
When I got there, I secretly
wished for something.

42:51.434 --> 42:52.334
Hey, Ed.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.734
Hey, Ray.

42:53.736 --> 42:56.740
- Mind if I come in?
- Sure.

43:02.378 --> 43:03.014
Thank you.

43:06.717 --> 43:12.521
Norman's probably stopped off
at the house to check in on him,

43:12.523 --> 43:14.321
you know?

43:14.323 --> 43:15.557
He's a good boy.

43:15.559 --> 43:17.725
Yeah, he is.

43:17.727 --> 43:18.593
Well, that's all right.

43:18.595 --> 43:20.495
It's you I wanted
to talk to anyhow.

43:20.497 --> 43:21.296
Oh yeah?

43:21.298 --> 43:22.631
Yeah.

43:22.633 --> 43:27.669
See too many things all
happening in one night.

43:27.671 --> 43:29.838
And I'm not one
for coincidences.

43:29.840 --> 43:30.475
OK.

43:34.378 --> 43:38.412
How about your tire that
fell flat that same night.

43:38.414 --> 43:40.816
Hank said that you
told him you thought it

43:40.818 --> 43:42.350
was retaliation for the fight.

43:42.352 --> 43:43.684
- You talked to Hank?
- Yeah, of course.

43:43.686 --> 43:44.452
I talked to everybody.

43:44.454 --> 43:46.287
Right.

43:46.289 --> 43:48.722
Well, I never told Hank it was
a retaliation for the fight.

43:48.724 --> 43:52.426
I might have just implied it.

43:52.428 --> 43:53.662
Oh.

43:53.664 --> 43:55.763
I don't know
who done it, but I

43:55.765 --> 43:59.200
think it was someone with
reason, someone pissed off

43:59.202 --> 44:02.172
and angry, maybe even jealous.

44:06.175 --> 44:08.843
Do you have any idea
who that person would be?

44:08.845 --> 44:10.711
Evening, Ed.

44:10.713 --> 44:13.715
Hey, Norman.

44:13.717 --> 44:14.519
Can I get you something?

44:17.854 --> 44:19.488
No, no, no.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.323
I'm just... I'm just hanging
out keeping Ray company.

44:22.325 --> 44:23.591
OK.

44:23.593 --> 44:28.497
Uh, you need any
help with anything?

44:28.499 --> 44:29.133
No, I do not.

44:32.135 --> 44:33.901
You know, we're just going to
let this sit for a little bit.

44:33.903 --> 44:38.405
Storm's coming and
something's bound to turn up.

44:38.407 --> 44:39.874
Good night, boys.

44:39.876 --> 44:41.711
- Good night, Ed.
- Good night, Ed.

44:52.155 --> 44:54.155
You tell him anything?

44:54.157 --> 44:54.689
No.

44:54.691 --> 44:55.524
He knows something.

44:55.526 --> 44:56.194
I don't know.

45:10.706 --> 45:14.111
[ominous music]

46:25.782 --> 46:29.017
Can't go around
making accusations.

46:29.019 --> 46:30.655
You know that.

46:38.762 --> 46:41.399
You know, Ed, there's two
kind of policemen in this world,

46:47.838 --> 46:50.341
man and time.

46:53.443 --> 46:55.246
Sometime you just got to
let time do its thing.

47:05.655 --> 47:08.390
Can I help you with anything?

47:08.392 --> 47:10.291
No, I'm fine.
No, I got it.

47:10.293 --> 47:10.925
I got it.

47:10.927 --> 47:12.295
Please, please, I got it.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.975
Found your earring at the bar.

47:27.977 --> 47:29.880
It was on the floor.

47:35.852 --> 47:36.487
Thanks.

47:39.622 --> 47:42.827
- It's Abbey's.
- Oh.

47:46.630 --> 47:49.898
I wasn't looking forward
to telling her I lost it.

47:49.900 --> 47:52.003
Guess now I don't have to.

47:57.907 --> 48:01.278
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

48:24.700 --> 48:25.403

49:08.811 --> 49:09.447
Woo!

and blood denotes violence

our roles, we thus

50:34.264 --> 50:38.032

I'm glad that my daughter
has found someone who'll

51:27.983 --> 51:30.952
be able to take care of her.

51:30.954 --> 51:34.088
I wish them health
and happiness.

ALL: To Frances and Norman.

This turkey is delicious.

51:51.273 --> 51:54.642
Did you cook this all by
yourself, Mr. Campbell?

51:54.644 --> 51:56.945
No, that'd be Frances.

51:56.947 --> 51:58.211
Wow.

51:58.213 --> 51:59.983
Ain't Norm a lucky son of a gun.

52:30.012 --> 52:35.749
I know what you're
thinking about that girl.

52:35.751 --> 52:38.121
Got to tell you
she clears my mind.

52:41.191 --> 52:44.758
She's... she's so good to me.

52:44.760 --> 52:48.262
You know her and
Abbey never got along.

52:48.264 --> 52:49.696
What are you doing?

52:49.698 --> 52:50.698
NORMAN: I'm just saying.

52:50.700 --> 52:52.633
You preaching?

52:52.635 --> 52:54.669
- This a sermon?
- Never mind.

52:54.671 --> 52:57.238
Forget it.

52:57.240 --> 53:00.707
Your hands are just as dirty
as mine, or did you forget?

53:00.709 --> 53:01.711
Jesus, Ray, don't start.

53:06.081 --> 53:08.216
You ever ask yourself
why you did it?

53:08.218 --> 53:11.019
- You're drunk.
- Did you?

53:11.021 --> 53:12.387
For you.

53:12.389 --> 53:13.187
I did it for you.

53:13.189 --> 53:15.122
Don't you forget it.

53:15.124 --> 53:17.825
Oh, well that's a good plan.

53:17.827 --> 53:20.394
Fuck you, Ray.

53:20.396 --> 53:22.062
That's right.

53:22.064 --> 53:27.769
Walk away like nothing's
wrong, like nothing happened.

53:27.771 --> 53:31.071
You got a problem, Ray,
don't put me in it, because I'm

53:31.073 --> 53:33.140
done shoveling your shit.

53:33.142 --> 53:36.276
You know we sit, we eat,
and we smile at each other

53:36.278 --> 53:37.780
like all's just fine.

53:41.251 --> 53:44.117
Is everything all right?

Come on.

Congratulations.

53:55.030 --> 53:55.666
Living the dream.

54:01.271 --> 54:03.870
What happened?

54:03.872 --> 54:04.439
Nothing.

54:04.441 --> 54:06.039
Come on.

54:06.041 --> 54:07.910
Let's go back inside
before you catch something.

54:15.485 --> 54:19.887
9, 8, 7, 6...

54:19.889 --> 54:21.388
You know this is the
first year I got somebody

54:21.390 --> 54:24.794
to kiss on New Year's Eve.

56:25.447 --> 56:27.448
Hey.

56:27.450 --> 56:30.885
Have you seen Ray?

56:30.887 --> 56:35.122
I haven't heard
from him all week.

56:35.124 --> 56:35.559
Nope.

56:39.162 --> 56:42.963
Would you tell
him that I came by.

56:42.965 --> 56:44.532
Sure.

56:44.534 --> 56:48.301
Somebody please put that
poor girl out of her misery.

56:48.303 --> 56:49.604
I honestly thought
Ray had better

56:49.606 --> 56:50.573
sense than to just lead her on.

56:54.209 --> 56:56.209
Hello.

56:56.211 --> 56:56.847
What?

57:03.452 --> 57:06.419
Where'd you get this?

57:06.421 --> 57:08.488
Mr. Jensen found it.

57:08.490 --> 57:10.490
Says it was Abbey's.

57:10.492 --> 57:12.292
I'm sure it's your girl's.

57:12.294 --> 57:14.662
Ain't no other Abbey hereabouts.

57:14.664 --> 57:16.997
Abbey never engraved a key.

57:16.999 --> 57:20.033
RILEY JENSEN: Not
saying she did.

57:20.035 --> 57:24.638
If it just said Abbey,
I wouldn't be here.

57:24.640 --> 57:30.244
But the bow says To Abbey
right in the middle of a heart.

57:30.246 --> 57:34.015
A girl don't go addressing
gifts to herself.

57:34.017 --> 57:36.383
Abbey's keys were
found in her car.

57:36.385 --> 57:40.120
I want to know why
this one wasn't attached.

57:40.122 --> 57:43.427
I found it right
nearabouts where she died.

57:46.996 --> 57:48.164
You come here
asking for a reward?

57:56.072 --> 57:56.506
Go get my billfold.

58:24.300 --> 58:25.635
Don't muck things up.

59:38.608 --> 59:41.307
What are you doing?

59:41.309 --> 59:43.176
Why didn't you tell me
you dropped Abbey's key?

59:43.178 --> 59:44.077
What the heck are
you talking about?

59:44.079 --> 59:45.245
The one with her
name written on it.

59:45.247 --> 59:46.046
Oh.

59:46.048 --> 59:46.579
Yeah.

59:46.581 --> 59:48.416
That one.

59:48.418 --> 59:50.417
- You piece of shit.
- What the fuck.

59:50.419 --> 59:52.452
Don't give me that I
don't care attitude, Ray.

59:52.454 --> 59:53.421
I don't.

59:53.423 --> 59:54.521
I don't care.

59:54.523 --> 59:56.657
I'm tired of lying.

59:56.659 --> 59:58.591
I'm tired of
tracking what I said

59:58.593 --> 01:00:00.827
and when I said it so it
fits fucking perfectly

01:00:00.829 --> 01:00:02.298
so that no one catches on.

01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:30.224
You know the last thing
that went through my head

01:00:30.226 --> 01:00:32.526
when the car hit the bump?

01:00:32.528 --> 01:00:34.197
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:00:39.367 --> 01:00:40.533
You told me it
was an accident.

01:00:40.535 --> 01:00:41.702
It was.

01:00:41.704 --> 01:00:42.669
That the gun just went off.

01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:44.273
It did, all right.

01:00:47.742 --> 01:00:54.180
We were just arguing, you
know, a bullshit argument.

01:00:54.182 --> 01:00:56.617
That's all.

01:00:56.619 --> 01:00:58.622
Except now I got this story in
my head, the what if, you know?

01:01:04.727 --> 01:01:06.626
What if I killed her?

01:01:06.628 --> 01:01:09.696
What if I meant it?

01:01:09.698 --> 01:01:11.798
And I don't want to
believe it, but I can't

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:13.767
fucking get rid of it, man.

01:01:13.769 --> 01:01:15.138
- I can't...
- Shh.

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:42.299
Ray.

01:01:46.468 --> 01:01:47.468
Listen to me.

01:01:47.470 --> 01:01:51.271
Ray, you didn't shoot
Abbey on purpose, OK?

01:01:51.273 --> 01:01:52.673
I know it because
that's not you, Ray.

01:01:52.675 --> 01:01:55.508
You hearing me?

01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:57.878
Look at me.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.182
You didn't, OK?

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:02.249
Peoples think I did.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.184
No one thinks you did.

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:04.119
They suspect me.

01:02:04.121 --> 01:02:05.255
What good would it
do telling them now?

01:02:08.191 --> 01:02:10.823
We just heard it, Ray.

01:02:10.825 --> 01:02:13.693
This shit, it's ours.

01:02:13.695 --> 01:02:17.597
We have to deal with it.

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:19.399
You should have taken me in.

01:02:21.236 --> 01:02:21.671
Don't lose that.

01:02:24.941 --> 01:02:26.643
That's what you
should have done.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.302
What the hell?

01:03:01.276 --> 01:03:03.280
All right.
You go get some sleep.

01:03:11.653 --> 01:03:15.021
Hey, I'm going to hang
on to this for a while.

01:03:15.023 --> 01:03:17.557
Call me if you need anything.

01:03:17.559 --> 01:03:19.492
You can't go from
house to house trying

01:03:19.494 --> 01:03:20.727
to find a lock that fits a key.

01:03:20.729 --> 01:03:21.729
That's against the law.

01:03:21.731 --> 01:03:22.664
That's breaking and entering.

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:24.365
Well, maybe if you
and Ed tried harder,

01:03:24.367 --> 01:03:25.733
I wouldn't have to
break and enter.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:27.434
To do what you did
tonight, I'd need a warrant.

01:03:27.436 --> 01:03:28.669
So get one.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:29.370
I need evidence.

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.941
I'm a deputy, not a vigilante.

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:39.680
I'm ready now.

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:42.015
I wasn't before, but I am now.

01:03:42.017 --> 01:03:42.952
- For what?
- To see it.

01:03:46.389 --> 01:03:46.986
The place she died.

01:03:46.988 --> 01:03:48.622
I want you to show me.

01:03:48.624 --> 01:03:50.923
Why?

01:03:50.925 --> 01:03:52.526
I need to see it.

01:03:52.528 --> 01:03:53.727
There is nothing to
see there, Frances.

01:03:53.729 --> 01:03:55.963
What are you afraid of?

01:03:55.965 --> 01:03:58.865
What'd you mean?

01:03:58.867 --> 01:04:00.633
OK.

01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:01.604
You know what, I'm going to
sleep in the trailer tonight.

01:04:15.617 --> 01:04:16.783
To Abbey.

01:04:16.785 --> 01:04:19.419
This is Abbey Campbell's?

01:04:19.421 --> 01:04:21.622
That's what I'm
hoping to find out.

01:04:21.624 --> 01:04:24.325
Well, we got an engraving
pen around here somewhere.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:25.892
But these letters
aren't handmade.

01:04:25.894 --> 01:04:26.795
This is machine tooled.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:30.930
Machine?

01:04:30.932 --> 01:04:33.100
Yep.

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:34.901
My machine doesn't do engraving.

01:04:34.903 --> 01:04:36.437
It won't work that.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.637
You may have to go
someplace that can afford

01:04:37.639 --> 01:04:39.773
that equipment, city maybe.

01:04:39.775 --> 01:04:41.841
Greenfield, Jericho.

01:04:41.843 --> 01:04:45.845
That'd be like trying to find
a needle in a haystack though.

01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:47.483
- Wish it was that easy.
- What?

01:04:50.519 --> 01:04:51.984
Where you drop a
stack of hay in a tub

01:04:51.986 --> 01:04:53.921
of water and the needle
will fall to the bottom.

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.622
The hay'll float on top.
Hey?

01:04:56.624 --> 01:04:57.658
Well, ain't that something.

01:04:57.660 --> 01:04:58.925
Yeah.

01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:01.861
Then you end up with
a pile of moldy hay.

01:05:01.863 --> 01:05:02.662
Thanks, Hank.

01:05:02.664 --> 01:05:03.365
Yeah.

01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:30.793
It's your last one
and you can get out.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.600
Ray Young.

01:05:39.602 --> 01:05:42.970
How you been?

01:05:42.972 --> 01:05:44.738
You look kind of sad.

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:46.573
He look sad, boys?

01:05:46.575 --> 01:05:47.541
Real sad.

01:05:47.543 --> 01:05:50.109
Looks kind of fucking
moody if you ask me.

01:05:50.111 --> 01:05:51.178
Maybe he's on his period.

01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.415
Oh shit, Ray, you bleeding?

01:05:54.950 --> 01:05:57.050
Oh shit.

01:05:57.052 --> 01:05:57.687
Oy.

01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:02.425
That's a quick temper you got.

01:06:05.860 --> 01:06:09.695
It's your move.

01:06:09.697 --> 01:06:12.432
What's the matter, Ray, you off?

01:06:12.434 --> 01:06:13.869
What's still eating you
after all this time?

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.169
Hey Ray.

01:06:50.171 --> 01:06:53.443
- How you doing?
- Fine.

01:06:57.012 --> 01:07:01.747
I heard there was an incident
at the Whispering Pig again.

01:07:01.749 --> 01:07:03.850
- You here to take me In
- No.

01:07:03.852 --> 01:07:04.686
I don't care about the fight.

01:07:07.622 --> 01:07:09.256
But it did get me to
thinking about Abbey's

01:07:09.258 --> 01:07:10.193
car parked up by that lake.

01:07:16.764 --> 01:07:18.700
Did Norman ever tell you
that it was a cover up?

01:07:21.669 --> 01:07:25.705
Botched up, but still,
someone helped someone

01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:27.610
cover up the tracks,
a meticulous someone.

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:37.818
You ever see a gray
wolf on a hunt?

01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:40.153
Can't say that I have.

01:07:40.155 --> 01:07:42.155
Alone they're not very
skilled, just picking

01:07:42.157 --> 01:07:43.126
off berries and rodents.

01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:49.665
But you get them in a pack
and they work together.

01:07:54.035 --> 01:07:59.171
Anyway, there is a sheep
farm in Labelle owned

01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:03.309
by a fellow named Lenny Bendro.

01:08:03.311 --> 01:08:07.314
Now one winter
Lenny had four lambs

01:08:07.316 --> 01:08:10.053
in two weeks gone missing.
Vanished.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.557
All the traps he
set were sprung.

01:08:17.692 --> 01:08:19.626
Nothing in them.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:24.029
So he finally he just he
tied a sheep to a post.

01:08:24.032 --> 01:08:27.801
And he planted a ring of traps
around her, far enough away

01:08:27.803 --> 01:08:29.072
that she wouldn't get hurt.

01:08:35.009 --> 01:08:37.778
That morning, when he came
out and the sheep was there,

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:42.582
she was unharmed, braying and
screaming and all kind of hell.

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:44.318
And not five feet away
from her was a little wolf

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:46.953
puppy in one of the traps.

01:08:46.955 --> 01:08:52.292
And standing next to him was
his mama licking his wound.

01:08:52.294 --> 01:08:55.028
And Lenny saw that the wolf's
leg was all gone to hell

01:08:55.029 --> 01:08:56.930
and there was nothing
for it but to get it over

01:08:56.932 --> 01:09:01.301
with so he raised his
rifle and he sighted in.

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:01.938
Pew.

01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:09.908
And when he fired, the mama wolf
leapt in front of her puppy.

01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:11.345
And she took the
bullet in the neck.

01:09:11.346 --> 01:09:12.615
She was dead before
she hit the ground.

01:09:16.184 --> 01:09:21.886
Bottom line is, when
it comes to protection,

01:09:21.889 --> 01:09:23.593
nothing loves you like
your own flesh and blood.

01:09:29.231 --> 01:09:30.066
You got something
to tell me, Ray?

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:35.037
Whatever it is, I
can help you, son.

01:09:42.044 --> 01:09:43.645
Have a good night, Ed.

01:10:25.687 --> 01:10:28.221
I'm going to go pick
up Liam from school.

01:10:28.223 --> 01:10:29.855
OK.

01:10:29.857 --> 01:10:32.693
You need anything
from the grocery?

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.961
No.

01:10:34.963 --> 01:10:37.767
- Want to come with me?
- I'm OK.

01:11:16.304 --> 01:11:18.437
Hey.

01:11:18.439 --> 01:11:19.075
Hey.

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:26.779
I was thinking we
should go fishing.

01:11:26.781 --> 01:11:29.282
Little late in
the day, isn't it?

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:32.385
Lake will be nice.

01:11:32.387 --> 01:11:33.856
I see you go sometimes.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:37.950
Whoa, whoa.

01:12:37.952 --> 01:12:39.856
- Run and do your homework.
- Fine.

01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:45.492
Frances.

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.258
Fran?

01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:48.097
[coughing]

01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:55.467
You need a doctor.

01:12:55.469 --> 01:12:57.436
They went fishing.

01:12:57.438 --> 01:13:01.474
France and your brother, they
went fishing at the lake.

01:13:01.476 --> 01:13:02.976
OK.

01:13:02.978 --> 01:13:07.213
Another thing, back
door needs a new lock.

01:13:07.215 --> 01:13:09.117
You know where the extra
lock that was in the shed is?

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:13.552
Ray broke the trailer one.

01:13:13.554 --> 01:13:15.422
Came home pissed drunk,
couldn't find his keys.

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:18.557
I had to replace it.

01:13:18.559 --> 01:13:19.961
I'm going to go get
another one from Hank's.

01:13:37.079 --> 01:13:38.410
Hey, Ray?

01:13:38.412 --> 01:13:40.646
Can you watch my line?

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:42.552
Gotta go to the bathroom.

01:15:02.196 --> 01:15:05.498
Come on.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.668
Let's go.

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:12.071
Did Norman tell you, Ray?

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:14.474
What?

01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:18.310
Where they found her car.

01:15:18.312 --> 01:15:19.111
Go on.

01:15:19.113 --> 01:15:22.082
We should... we
shouldn't be here.

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:25.051
Come on.

01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:26.255
I need to know.

01:16:09.196 --> 01:16:13.365
There's no mark,
not even a cross.

01:16:13.367 --> 01:16:15.338
They usually put up a cross.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.776
You remember my ma?

01:16:23.778 --> 01:16:28.080
She had this chair in her room
with this flower design on it,

01:16:28.082 --> 01:16:32.819
pink, yellow, all the
things on her rocker.

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:34.686
We used to sit and
then she pushed

01:16:34.688 --> 01:16:41.360
back and forth while I was
reading, just the two of us.

01:16:41.362 --> 01:16:44.129
But when her heart got weak,
her legs got tired of pushing.

01:16:44.131 --> 01:16:46.035
My daddy took her
off the rocker.

01:16:59.313 --> 01:17:04.717
The summer after
she died, I used

01:17:04.719 --> 01:17:08.821
to sit in that chair for hours.

01:17:08.823 --> 01:17:10.526
It didn't matter
how late it was.

01:17:13.495 --> 01:17:16.863
You know why I sat there?

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:17.931
Because I couldn't
help but think

01:17:17.933 --> 01:17:24.436
that maybe she overlooked
something, that maybe

01:17:24.438 --> 01:17:25.437
she had missed something.

01:17:25.439 --> 01:17:29.508
And maybe if I sat there
too, I'd figure it out.

01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:31.211
I know why you sit there, Ray.

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:32.648
I know why you sit by that lake.

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:38.318
Did you figure it out
what you could have done?

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.121
What you could have
done differently.

01:17:46.594 --> 01:17:48.731
Frances.
Ray.

01:17:55.336 --> 01:17:55.771
Frances?

01:17:59.773 --> 01:18:01.341
Hey.
What happened?

01:18:01.343 --> 01:18:02.475
Just stay away from me.

01:18:02.477 --> 01:18:04.343
What the hell is going on?

01:18:04.345 --> 01:18:06.913
You tell me.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:09.181
What?

01:18:09.183 --> 01:18:11.253
What happened up here
between Ray and my sister?

01:18:15.924 --> 01:18:19.359
Is there something
Ray told you?

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.294
He didn't have to tell me.

01:18:22.296 --> 01:18:23.663
It's written all over his face.

01:18:23.665 --> 01:18:26.466
And it's killing him.

01:18:26.468 --> 01:18:27.236
So just tell me.

01:18:30.371 --> 01:18:30.805
Tell you what?

01:18:34.342 --> 01:18:35.143
Did you know?

01:18:41.549 --> 01:18:43.483
Fran.

01:18:43.485 --> 01:18:46.185
Fran.

01:18:46.187 --> 01:18:49.189
It was an accident.

01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.923
I don't believe you.

01:18:50.925 --> 01:18:53.560
It was an accident, I swear.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:55.662
She wanted him to
teach her how to shoot.

01:18:55.664 --> 01:18:56.663
She took your pop's gun.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:57.797
He was holding it.

01:18:57.799 --> 01:19:00.733
When the car went over a
pothole, it went off, I swear.

01:19:00.735 --> 01:19:03.535
I don't believe you.

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:04.236
Frances.

01:19:04.238 --> 01:19:04.870
Frances.

01:19:04.872 --> 01:19:05.875
How long have you known?

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:14.814
The whole time.

01:19:14.816 --> 01:19:16.285
You knew the whole time.

01:19:20.854 --> 01:19:21.954
Frances, I'm taking you home.

01:19:21.956 --> 01:19:22.721
Stop. Don't.

01:19:22.723 --> 01:19:24.556
I'm taking you home.

01:19:24.558 --> 01:19:26.626
Get off me.
Stop.

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.794
Get off of me.

01:19:28.796 --> 01:19:31.497
Get off me.
No.

01:19:31.499 --> 01:19:32.998
No.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:35.870
- Let go.
- Frances.

01:19:40.642 --> 01:19:43.610
Let go.

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:44.813
Let me out.

01:19:48.883 --> 01:19:50.850
- Let me out.
- Frances.

01:19:50.852 --> 01:19:52.552
Frances, stop.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.519
No!

01:19:53.521 --> 01:19:54.520
Frances, stop.

01:19:54.522 --> 01:19:55.020
Frances, stop.

01:19:55.022 --> 01:19:55.654
Stop.

01:19:55.656 --> 01:19:56.422
Stop.

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:57.523
Stop.

01:19:57.525 --> 01:19:59.891
Stop.

01:19:59.893 --> 01:20:01.627
He begged me, Fran.

01:20:01.629 --> 01:20:03.930
He begged me.

01:20:03.932 --> 01:20:05.364
What was I supposed to do?

01:20:05.366 --> 01:20:05.800
Ray's family.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.375
What am I?

01:20:36.830 --> 01:20:37.832
Any pain here?

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:43.002
Well, you sprained it.

01:20:43.004 --> 01:20:44.404
We'll wrap it up.

01:20:44.406 --> 01:20:45.841
Give it six to eight weeks.

01:20:52.746 --> 01:20:53.381
There's something else.

01:21:05.492 --> 01:21:07.459
Tom.

01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:08.397
Tom, I'm sorry.

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:40.329
Tom.
Tom.

01:22:18.633 --> 01:22:19.532
Excuse me.

01:22:19.534 --> 01:22:21.934
Can I get the status
on Frances Young?

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:22.901
She's still in the room.

01:22:22.903 --> 01:22:24.404
I need to talk to her doctor.

01:22:24.406 --> 01:22:26.439
Please take a
seat, Officer Young.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:29.809
Sir, sir, you cannot
get back there that way.

01:22:29.811 --> 01:22:31.010
She came here
with a hurt hand.

01:22:31.012 --> 01:22:33.578
What the heck is taking so long?

01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.782
She requested
not to let you in.

01:22:39.554 --> 01:22:40.589
Tell her I'll be
in the waiting room.

01:23:00.942 --> 01:23:02.641
You still here?

01:23:02.643 --> 01:23:04.476
Yeah.

01:23:04.478 --> 01:23:06.712
Still no luck?

01:23:06.714 --> 01:23:08.513
No.

01:23:08.515 --> 01:23:12.150
I've called every trophy place,
locksmith in the entire state.

01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:16.588
Nobody's got any record of him.

01:23:16.590 --> 01:23:18.858
Lock it goes to is
probably long gone anyhow.

01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:20.493
No.

01:23:20.495 --> 01:23:23.863
It ain't exactly what
you'd call direct evidence.

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:26.032
Nope.

01:23:26.034 --> 01:23:28.403
But it might put
my mind at ease.

01:23:31.939 --> 01:23:32.971
Good night, Ed.

01:23:32.973 --> 01:23:34.075
Don't stay too late.

01:23:40.548 --> 01:23:41.580
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:23:41.582 --> 01:23:43.615
You have to sign out.

01:23:43.617 --> 01:23:44.050
Frances.

01:23:44.052 --> 01:23:46.519
Ma'am.

01:23:46.521 --> 01:23:48.253
Sir, you have to sign her out.

01:23:48.255 --> 01:23:48.890
Here.

01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:52.827
Sir, the paperwork.

01:23:59.166 --> 01:24:00.833
Frances.

01:24:00.835 --> 01:24:01.570
Frances, wait.

01:24:42.210 --> 01:24:45.944
I wrote down everything I did.

01:24:45.946 --> 01:24:46.747
It's all in there.

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.854
I'm going to take it to Ed
and I'm going to come clean.

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:55.421
You can try and stop me.

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:57.559
You can do whatever you want.

01:25:18.745 --> 01:25:19.180
OK.

01:25:34.862 --> 01:25:36.565
When was the last time
that you and I went fishing?

01:26:01.656 --> 01:26:03.325
[coughing]

01:26:41.929 --> 01:26:44.829
You're a horse woman, right?

01:26:44.831 --> 01:26:46.065
I own a few if
that's what you mean.

01:26:46.067 --> 01:26:47.667
Yeah.

01:26:47.669 --> 01:26:49.401
You wouldn't happen to
know where the Campbells...

01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:51.870
the auction house that the
Campbells get their stock from.

01:26:51.872 --> 01:26:52.872
What auction house?

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.806
Well, that would be Bill Tealer.

01:26:54.808 --> 01:26:56.374
- It's up in Carl Junction.
- That's the one.

01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:58.977
He supplies most of the
head north of Springfield.

01:26:58.979 --> 01:27:00.046
Are you looking to buy a horse?

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:00.846
No.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.082
Thank you.

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:05.754
[suspenseful music]

01:27:21.803 --> 01:27:23.671
[jingle]

01:27:24.972 --> 01:27:25.738
How you doing?

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.172
All right, sir.

01:27:27.174 --> 01:27:29.240
Did y'all make that key?

01:27:29.242 --> 01:27:31.045
Yes, sir, we did.

01:27:37.018 --> 01:27:39.017
Remember coming
down here as kids?

01:27:39.019 --> 01:27:39.720
Yeah.

01:27:42.823 --> 01:27:44.692
It was good times, right?

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:52.934
Well, at least
we'll be together.

01:27:57.504 --> 01:27:59.971
In prison.

01:27:59.973 --> 01:28:01.806
We'll be together.

01:28:01.808 --> 01:28:04.278
They don't put cops
with other prisoners.

01:28:43.151 --> 01:28:44.382
You're burning up.

01:28:44.384 --> 01:28:45.316
- I need a doctor.
- No.

01:28:45.318 --> 01:28:46.519
No.
No.

01:28:46.521 --> 01:28:48.820
No doctor.

01:28:48.822 --> 01:28:49.256
No.

01:28:56.062 --> 01:28:57.298
You're going to
finish what I can't.

01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:05.203
You're going to kill
that boy whose killed

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:09.877
your sister and that other too.

01:29:14.147 --> 01:29:15.047
I love him.

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:15.484
What's that?

01:29:23.357 --> 01:29:24.860
You pathetic girl.

01:29:28.862 --> 01:29:31.031
It's weakness made
you what you are.

01:29:37.571 --> 01:29:42.476
No, Daddy, it made you.

01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:54.419
Hey now.

01:29:54.421 --> 01:29:55.055
Where are you going?

01:29:58.259 --> 01:30:00.559
Come back here.

01:30:00.561 --> 01:30:01.530
You hear me?

01:30:20.548 --> 01:30:23.315
Where are you going?

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:24.516
Confess.

01:30:24.518 --> 01:30:28.419
Ray, don't do this.

01:30:28.421 --> 01:30:29.555
You don't have to.

01:30:29.557 --> 01:30:30.592
And you can't either.

01:30:34.228 --> 01:30:37.195
I corroborated
your story, Ray.

01:30:37.197 --> 01:30:38.364
I'm implicated in
whatever you say.

01:30:38.366 --> 01:30:39.000
Do you understand that?

01:30:42.969 --> 01:30:44.002
You don't have to
turn yourself in.

01:30:44.004 --> 01:30:45.904
Just leave town.

01:30:45.906 --> 01:30:48.440
It don't matter
where I'm at, Norm,

01:30:48.442 --> 01:30:51.409
because it's all up in here.

01:30:51.411 --> 01:30:52.610
How do you not get that?

01:30:52.612 --> 01:30:54.012
- Stop.
- Ray.

01:30:54.014 --> 01:30:54.445
Just stop.

01:30:54.447 --> 01:30:55.316
[inaudible]

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:07.559
Ray.

01:31:07.561 --> 01:31:09.395
Ray.

01:31:09.397 --> 01:31:10.031
Ray, stop.

01:31:17.571 --> 01:31:18.907
Are you hearing me, Ray?

01:31:23.477 --> 01:31:26.412
You hearing me, Ray?

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:27.549
I'm hearing you.

01:31:31.352 --> 01:31:34.686
What do you want from me, man?

01:31:34.688 --> 01:31:38.222
I did everything you asked.

01:31:38.224 --> 01:31:45.933
I went to work, played
family, I did it.

01:31:51.237 --> 01:31:51.906
Look at me.

01:31:55.509 --> 01:31:56.912
Look at me.

01:32:02.482 --> 01:32:03.384
Look at me!

01:32:09.022 --> 01:32:12.557
I've got nothing.

01:32:12.559 --> 01:32:14.659
I've got nothing.

01:32:14.661 --> 01:32:18.262
I ain't got no Abbey.

01:32:18.264 --> 01:32:20.332
Ain't got no wife.

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:21.937
I got you.

01:32:37.785 --> 01:32:38.516
- Ray.
- Don't.

01:32:38.518 --> 01:32:39.153
Ray.

01:32:42.356 --> 01:32:45.289
Ray.

01:32:45.291 --> 01:32:47.226
Ray, stop.

01:32:47.228 --> 01:32:50.128
Ray.

01:32:50.130 --> 01:32:52.096
What did you think
was going to happen?

01:32:52.098 --> 01:32:54.733
You think Ed's going
to go easy on you?

01:32:54.735 --> 01:32:56.034
You think you're
getting off easy

01:32:56.036 --> 01:32:58.236
because you didn't mean it?
Not now.

01:32:58.238 --> 01:32:59.171
Not after all this time.

01:32:59.173 --> 01:32:59.607
Ray.

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.749
I can't let you get in
that car, God damn it.

01:33:11.751 --> 01:33:13.284
Ray.

01:33:13.286 --> 01:33:15.686
You're making this so
God damn difficult. Ray!

01:33:15.688 --> 01:33:17.025
I'll make it easy for you.

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:22.560
You selfish fuck.

01:33:22.562 --> 01:33:25.230
You prick.

01:33:25.232 --> 01:33:28.403
God damn it, Ray.
Ray.

01:33:32.439 --> 01:33:34.405
Ray!

01:33:34.407 --> 01:33:37.575
Ray!

01:33:37.577 --> 01:33:38.510
God damn it, Ray.

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:39.610
Don't you do it.

01:33:39.612 --> 01:33:42.616
Ray, don't you do it.
Ray!

01:35:40.867 --> 01:35:41.503
Ray?

01:35:54.848 --> 01:35:55.483
Sheriff.

01:35:59.954 --> 01:36:02.887
Miss Frances.

01:36:02.889 --> 01:36:05.423
You feeling all right?

01:36:05.425 --> 01:36:06.425
Just fine.

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.262
Thank you.

01:36:09.929 --> 01:36:11.997
What can I do for you?

01:36:11.999 --> 01:36:17.368
Well, I'm looking for Ray.

01:36:17.370 --> 01:36:18.572
Do you know where he's at?

01:36:21.508 --> 01:36:23.708
Why?

01:36:23.710 --> 01:36:25.780
Because I want to Talk to him.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:31.486
Because I was hoping
I wasn't too late.

01:36:36.823 --> 01:36:39.591
Sheriff.

01:36:39.593 --> 01:36:40.958
Yes.

01:36:40.960 --> 01:36:44.529
Have you talked to my
daddy about being here,

01:36:44.531 --> 01:36:45.867
seeing it's his
property and all?

01:36:50.603 --> 01:36:51.435
No.

01:36:51.437 --> 01:36:53.805
I guess I did not.

01:36:53.807 --> 01:36:56.440
I hear you can get
in all kinds of trouble

01:36:56.442 --> 01:36:57.411
breaking and entering.

01:37:04.951 --> 01:37:06.853
Ain't that the truth.

01:37:44.724 --> 01:37:47.793
Hey, Ed.

01:37:47.795 --> 01:37:48.429
Hey, Norman.

01:37:51.331 --> 01:37:53.998
Ed was just
wondering about Ray.

01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:54.635
NORMAN: Oh.

01:37:57.737 --> 01:37:59.837
Do you know when
he's coming back?

01:37:59.839 --> 01:38:00.638
Ray?

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:01.276
Yeah, Ray.

01:38:05.879 --> 01:38:09.715
I don't think Ray's
coming back, Ed.

01:38:09.717 --> 01:38:10.418
You?

01:38:21.961 --> 01:38:22.597
I figured as much.

01:38:26.099 --> 01:38:28.303
Best be going.

01:40:21.381 --> 01:40:26.381
