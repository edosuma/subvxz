WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:24.291 --> 01:26.291
If you could possibly hurry.

01:36.875 --> 01:39.458
Christopher Robin!

01:42.583 --> 01:46.250
Tigger: Help!
Christopher Robin, help!

02:02.458 --> 02:05.083
Mom: So that's
where my fan got to.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.333
Really, Christopher Robin,

02:07.333 --> 02:10.000
it looks like a tornado
hit your room.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.958
I think it's time
to clean it up.

02:14.083 --> 02:15.958
Uh, last spring.

02:15.958 --> 02:17.083
Remember?

02:17.083 --> 02:18.291
Throwing everything

02:18.291 --> 02:20.375
under the bed
with the crud

02:20.375 --> 02:22.166
is not cleaning up.

02:23.458 --> 02:25.000
I know, Mom,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.125
and I'll
put everything away

02:27.125 --> 02:29.125
after I go outside
and play.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.458
Before would be better.

02:31.458 --> 02:36.166
But, Mom, I promised Pooh
we'd play catch

02:36.166 --> 02:37.500
with my new ball.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.500
Your ball got lost
in this mess two weeks ago.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.166
I meant my yo-yo.

02:42.166 --> 02:43.458
It went last week.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.625
- My skates?
- Yesterday.

02:45.625 --> 02:49.125
I guess it's time
to clean up my room.

02:49.125 --> 02:52.208
- Huh, Mom?
- Say, there's an idea.

02:52.208 --> 02:55.333
And I'd start with,
uh, under the bed.

02:55.333 --> 02:59.000
Oh, and about
your bath this morning.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Try to use some of this
next time, huh?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's called soap.

03:08.166 --> 03:13.166
Oh, boy. This will take
a billion zillion years.

03:13.166 --> 03:16.708
We'll never
get to have any fun.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.500
Cleaning your room
isn't much fun.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.208
Why can't it just be
dum-dee-dum done?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.416
Yeah. Leave this
to me, buddy boy.

03:25.416 --> 03:27.250
I'll have these toys organized

03:27.250 --> 03:29.833
quicker than you can
say Jiminy Crockett.

03:35.625 --> 03:38.250
Well? Ha ha ha ha!
What do you think?

03:40.125 --> 03:44.875
Well, um, um, it looks
sort of, uh, um, uh...

03:44.875 --> 03:47.333
Very pile-ish.

03:49.125 --> 03:52.000
Oh, that's because
I'm not done yet.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.750
Now you see 'em,
and now you don't.

03:56.375 --> 03:59.875
Uh, Tigger, the mess is gone,

03:59.875 --> 04:04.250
but now Christopher Robin
seems to have a mountain

04:04.250 --> 04:06.458
right in the middle
of his room.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.708
Yeah, kind of ruins
the view, huh?

04:08.708 --> 04:11.583
Perhaps if only it were
a very small mountain.

04:11.583 --> 04:15.250
That's it, Piglet. We'll make
this mountain into a molehill.

04:18.416 --> 04:22.458
Wouldn't Mom like them
better up here, all neat?

04:22.458 --> 04:25.708
What? Stack all these things
way up on your shelf?

04:25.708 --> 04:28.333
Why, they could fall down
and hurt themself.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.750
You think they enjoy
lining up in a row?

04:30.750 --> 04:34.250
Why, I never heard one
say it was so.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.083
that from using their head

04:37.083 --> 04:38.875
for stuff like this

04:38.875 --> 04:40.250
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

04:41.625 --> 04:43.083
Under the bed?

04:43.083 --> 04:45.833
Absotutely.
That's what I said.

04:45.833 --> 04:48.458
and the box is too small

04:48.458 --> 04:50.750
And the drawers, why,
they're no fun at all.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.458
This is posilutely
the perfect spot.

04:53.458 --> 04:56.833
and it's not where it's not

04:56.833 --> 04:59.750
what I already said

04:59.750 --> 05:01.708
for stuff like this

05:04.208 --> 05:06.250
- Under the bed.
- Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

05:06.250 --> 05:08.416
Yeah. That's what I said.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.583
for all of your stuff

05:14.291 --> 05:16.208
But, Christopher Robin,

05:16.208 --> 05:20.583
isn't under the bed a darkish
and scary kind of place?

05:20.583 --> 05:24.333
Uh, not to mention...dirty.

05:24.333 --> 05:28.208
Silly old bear.
They'll be all right.

05:28.208 --> 05:32.375
It's only for a little while
so we can go out and play.

05:36.375 --> 05:37.875
Hmm.

05:37.875 --> 05:39.750
Must want more stuff.

05:41.291 --> 05:43.625
No, Pooh.
He might not like it.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.208
Who might not like what,
Piglet?

05:46.208 --> 05:48.750
Why, Crud.
Don't you remember?

05:48.750 --> 05:51.458
Christopher Robin's mother
said he's under the bed.

05:51.458 --> 05:55.166
But, Piglet, don't you
want to go out and play?

05:56.166 --> 05:57.458
Male voice: Hey!

05:57.458 --> 06:00.083
Uh, you didn't do it
right, buddy bear,

06:00.083 --> 06:02.000
because you got to have
the right windup.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.416
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:04.708 --> 06:07.083
See? What did I tell you?

06:07.083 --> 06:09.833
Hey, who's the wise guy?
Who's the wise guy?

06:11.000 --> 06:14.625
Maybe Crud doesn't
like left shoes.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.000
Tigger: Hey,
who turned out the lights?

06:20.000 --> 06:23.458
Male voice:
No more shoes, please.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.500
We already have one.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.250
Did you hear that,
Piglet?

06:30.250 --> 06:33.875
Y-Yes, b-but I wish I hadn't.

06:33.875 --> 06:37.500
If someone is speaking
to us, Piglet,

06:37.500 --> 06:41.208
we must answer, or they
might think us impolite.

06:41.208 --> 06:45.208
Hello, there,
Mr. Under the Bed.

06:45.208 --> 06:47.083
Did you say someth--

06:50.000 --> 06:52.250
- Christopher Robin:
Hey! What's going on?

06:53.708 --> 06:55.416
Let us out of here!

06:55.416 --> 06:58.583
Tigger:
Come on, buddy bear,
quit kidding around.

07:11.625 --> 07:14.708
Hoo. Now I know
how a sardiney feels.

07:18.416 --> 07:19.958
Where's Pooh?

07:22.125 --> 07:26.833
Pooh? Piglet? Where are you?

07:28.125 --> 07:33.875
Christopher Robin!

07:39.291 --> 07:41.333
Ooh. Where are we?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.875
Don't worry, Piglet.

07:42.875 --> 07:45.458
We're only
in the Under the Bed.

07:45.458 --> 07:49.958
Oh, dear. It's rather
dirty under here.

07:49.958 --> 07:53.458
Ooh. I hope Christopher
Robin comes soon,

07:53.458 --> 07:56.166
before C-C-Crud gets us.

07:56.166 --> 07:59.500
Oh. Oh,
it's all right, Piglet.

07:59.500 --> 08:02.458
We'll be out of here
in no time, see?

08:02.458 --> 08:04.708
Christopher Robin
sent his crayons

08:04.708 --> 08:06.125
to take us home.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.375
Where are they, Tigger?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.583
Aw, ha ha ha ha,

08:13.583 --> 08:16.000
they're probably just playing
hide and don't speak.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.166
You under there, Pooh boy?

08:24.833 --> 08:27.291
Ho ho ho! I got you now!

08:27.291 --> 08:30.083
Ready or not,
here I bounce!

08:33.416 --> 08:34.500
Gonna say uncle?

08:34.500 --> 08:36.166
Aunt?

08:36.166 --> 08:38.458
Uh, second cousin?

08:40.125 --> 08:42.625
Tigger, that's not Pooh.

08:42.625 --> 08:44.375
It sure felt like him.

08:45.708 --> 08:47.416
Tigger, he's gone.

08:47.416 --> 08:49.875
Under the bed.

08:49.875 --> 08:52.583
I've lost him.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.708
Then we'll just have to
go in after him.

08:54.708 --> 08:58.875
Yaah!

09:01.875 --> 09:03.875
Yahoo!

09:23.583 --> 09:26.291
Pooh!

09:27.375 --> 09:29.875
Piglet!

09:31.708 --> 09:35.083
Olly olly limburger cheese!

09:39.958 --> 09:42.958
Look at all this stuff.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.583
It's like
Christmas morning.

09:45.583 --> 09:48.291
Yeah, after you open
the presents.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.125
Tigger! This--

09:51.125 --> 09:54.583
This is the birthday card
my aunt Edna gave me

09:54.583 --> 09:57.125
three years ago.

09:57.125 --> 10:00.750
Hmm. Doesn't look
a day over 2.

10:07.125 --> 10:08.458
Ah-choo!

10:10.583 --> 10:12.125
What's that?

10:12.125 --> 10:13.958
It's him! Ah-choo!

10:13.958 --> 10:16.250
I mean it's you!

10:17.333 --> 10:19.583
I mean--
I mean you're him!

10:19.583 --> 10:20.583
Ah-choo!

10:24.625 --> 10:30.708
Ah-ah-ah-oh, Crud will
be so pleased. Yaah!

10:30.708 --> 10:32.125
Crud?

10:32.125 --> 10:33.500
Yes, yes.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.583
The Majestic Crud.

10:37.291 --> 10:39.500
The guru of garbage.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.000
The wise man of waste.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.708
Oh. And who are you?

10:45.708 --> 10:47.333
Me?

10:47.333 --> 10:49.291
Why, I'm Smudge.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.875
Crud's-- ah-choo!--

10:50.875 --> 10:52.875
aide de debris.

10:52.875 --> 10:57.375
Now-- ah-choo-- quickly,
quickly, follow me.

10:58.583 --> 11:02.125
Oh, imagine. You're you!

11:05.875 --> 11:07.625
Come on, Tigger.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.625
Maybe he knows where
Pooh and Piglet are.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.375
Whatever you say,
Christopher Robin,

11:12.375 --> 11:14.000
but if you ask me,

11:14.000 --> 11:17.000
I think this guy's one
stick short of a bundle.

11:20.583 --> 11:22.708
Hmm. Free-looking castle.

11:25.458 --> 11:29.708
Hey, that's no castle.
That's one of my shoes.

11:29.708 --> 11:32.375
Didn't know you had
such big feet.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.875
Hurry, hurry!
Crud is waiting!

11:58.708 --> 12:00.000
It's the boy.

12:16.958 --> 12:21.416
Please come closer, my boy.

12:44.083 --> 12:46.708
Good morning, Your Filthiness!

12:46.708 --> 12:51.333
I have brought-- hmm--

12:51.333 --> 12:53.125
the boy.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.250
Uh, hello.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.416
Uh, my name is--

12:57.416 --> 12:59.250
Christopher Robin.

13:00.583 --> 13:04.875
Everyone down here
knows who you are.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.625
And I am Crud, the--

13:09.625 --> 13:11.750
Master of Mud!

13:11.750 --> 13:14.625
The Surveyor of Slime!

13:14.625 --> 13:15.875
The King of--

13:15.875 --> 13:17.000
Smudge.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.708
Yes-- ah-choo--

13:18.708 --> 13:19.708
Your Muckiness.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.958
I'm speaking.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.125
Aah!

13:27.875 --> 13:30.750
Thank you, Your Putridness.

13:33.291 --> 13:36.000
Without you,
Christopher Robin,

13:36.000 --> 13:38.583
none of this would have
been possible.

13:38.583 --> 13:40.583
I did this?

13:40.583 --> 13:43.333
Why, yes.

13:43.333 --> 13:45.625
It's all made
out of the things

13:45.625 --> 13:48.166
you threw under the bed.

13:57.458 --> 14:00.166
Tigger: Ahem. Listen, uh,

14:00.166 --> 14:02.000
why don't we just
find Pooh boy

14:02.000 --> 14:03.833
and hit the road,
Christopher Robin?

14:03.833 --> 14:07.250
I, uh, I got a funny
feeling about this place.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.708
Boy, Mom was sure right

14:09.708 --> 14:12.958
about wanting me
to clean up down here.

14:12.958 --> 14:14.708
Clean up?

14:14.708 --> 14:18.000
Did you say clean up?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.375
No one cleans up down here!

14:21.375 --> 14:22.500
Smudge!

14:22.500 --> 14:25.458
At once, Your Muddiness.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.875
Oh, woe is me.

15:04.291 --> 15:07.416
Men! It's Christopher Robin!

15:09.375 --> 15:12.583
Hey! Let me go!
That's my ball and yo-yo

15:12.583 --> 15:14.583
and all my other toys.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.250
What are they doing with
that old vacuum cleaner?

15:18.250 --> 15:20.583
Crud: This, Christopher Robin,

15:20.583 --> 15:23.583
is my unvacuum.

15:23.583 --> 15:25.333
It works in reverse.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.000
Once it is filled,

15:27.000 --> 15:29.583
I'm going to spread
my dirt and grime

15:29.583 --> 15:31.416
everywhere.

15:31.416 --> 15:34.416
Today your bedroom,
tomorrow the world!

15:34.416 --> 15:38.083
Eww! That's disgusting!

15:38.083 --> 15:39.875
Hey!

15:39.875 --> 15:42.083
Tigger? Tigger!

15:42.083 --> 15:45.291
Okay, Crud, what have you
done with Tigger?

15:45.291 --> 15:47.125
Tigger who?

15:47.125 --> 15:49.125
And Pooh and Piglet.

15:49.125 --> 15:52.750
Oh, they're safe for now,

15:52.750 --> 15:55.958
but there'll be
no cleaning up.

15:55.958 --> 16:00.458
In fact, you're going to
help me make it more dirty!

16:00.458 --> 16:03.708
Or you'll never see
your friends again!

16:06.291 --> 16:08.958
I've helped you enough,
Crud.

16:08.958 --> 16:12.583
From now on,
my middle name is Clean.

16:12.583 --> 16:15.833
Ugh! Nasty! Nasty!

16:15.833 --> 16:17.875
Guards! Take him away!

16:17.875 --> 16:20.125
Just you wait, Crud.

16:20.125 --> 16:21.833
I'll be back.

16:21.833 --> 16:25.750
And when I do,
you'll be all washed up!

16:27.333 --> 16:29.333
I hate that word, too.

16:32.333 --> 16:36.583
Oh, my. Oh, dear. This place
is absolutely filthy.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.958
Never mind that.
What do we do?

16:38.958 --> 16:41.875
Start by sweeping the floor?

16:41.875 --> 16:45.291
No, no, no, no. What do we
do about Christopher Robin

16:45.291 --> 16:46.875
and that Crud fella?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.458
I believe we should--

16:48.458 --> 16:50.000
Yeah? Yeah?

16:50.000 --> 16:52.166
Should perhaps...

16:52.166 --> 16:53.833
Tell me, tell me!

16:53.833 --> 16:57.250
Maybe get out of here.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.625
That's it?

16:58.625 --> 17:00.416
I believe so.

17:00.416 --> 17:03.708
That's it! We'll escape!
Ha ha ha ha!

17:03.708 --> 17:06.375
Oh, buddy boy, for a bear
of very little brain,

17:06.375 --> 17:08.166
you sure got
a lot of stuffing.

17:10.000 --> 17:13.083
Let me out of here!
Let me out, I tell ya!

17:13.083 --> 17:14.458
Hmm.

17:14.458 --> 17:15.875
Tsk tsk tsk tsk.

17:18.416 --> 17:21.416
Oh, my. Why,
this floor isn't dirty.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.708
This dirt is the floor.

17:23.708 --> 17:28.458
Uh, Pooh, I believe
I've found a way out!

17:28.458 --> 17:31.375
Piglet? Oh, bother.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.625
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

17:37.208 --> 17:38.958
Aha!

17:38.958 --> 17:41.000
W-What do we do now,
Pooh?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.416
He looks awfully angry.

17:43.416 --> 17:45.708
He's not angry, Piglet.

17:45.708 --> 17:49.708
He's probably always
that lovely shade of red.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.416
Aren't you?

17:51.416 --> 17:53.291
Aah!

17:53.291 --> 17:55.250
Make a break for it!

18:08.958 --> 18:11.875
Whew. That sure was
a close call.

18:11.875 --> 18:14.083
Old wax lips
almost caught us.

18:14.083 --> 18:17.000
Don't look now, but I
think we have company.

18:18.375 --> 18:20.208
Crayons!

18:25.750 --> 18:27.625
Move those feet, Pooh boy,

18:27.625 --> 18:30.416
before we end up looking
like scrambled Easter eggs.

18:30.416 --> 18:32.708
Over there.

18:32.708 --> 18:34.833
Pooh:
Didn't Christopher Robin

18:34.833 --> 18:37.125
lose a roller skate
just like that,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.291
uh, some time ago?

18:43.875 --> 18:47.458
We're coming,
Christopher Robin!

18:51.500 --> 18:53.250
But not by skate.

19:12.750 --> 19:14.583
Tigger: Quick this way.

19:22.291 --> 19:23.875
Piglet: Look.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.208
They've put
Christopher Robin to bed.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
Pooh! Piglet! Tigger!

19:29.500 --> 19:32.458
We've come--
-- to save you.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.875
But we have to be
very, very careful,

19:38.875 --> 19:42.375
or the crayons
will find us.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.208
Raah!

19:44.208 --> 19:46.291
I think they already have!

19:46.291 --> 19:47.875
Run!

19:59.708 --> 20:00.875
Whew!

20:03.833 --> 20:06.166
Hello again.

20:07.875 --> 20:11.583
I'll never join you, Crud.

20:11.583 --> 20:14.375
I'd rather clean first.

20:14.375 --> 20:16.500
Clean?

20:16.500 --> 20:18.000
Clean?

20:18.000 --> 20:20.291
Clean?

20:20.291 --> 20:22.375
Christopher Robin!

20:22.375 --> 20:24.166
The bath soap!

20:25.166 --> 20:27.583
Good old Mom.

20:27.583 --> 20:29.500
Aah!

20:29.500 --> 20:33.416
No. Keep it away!
Keep it away from me!

20:36.250 --> 20:37.750
Come on, you guys,

20:37.750 --> 20:41.125
let's help Christopher Robin
clean up this Crud.

20:44.958 --> 20:47.583
Christopher Robin:
No! Don't turn that on!

20:47.583 --> 20:49.708
It works backwards!

20:49.708 --> 20:53.250
Not anymore.
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

20:53.250 --> 20:56.083
Old yo-yo did a little
rinker-tinkering.

21:00.208 --> 21:05.875
No! No! Smudge!

21:05.875 --> 21:09.583
Coming, Your Muddiness!

21:09.583 --> 21:13.250
Ah-choo!

21:13.250 --> 21:15.875
- Hurray! We've won!
-

21:18.708 --> 21:19.875
Pooh: Yay!

21:19.875 --> 21:21.583
Hurry, hurry.

21:21.583 --> 21:24.291
We've got to really
clean this room up

21:24.291 --> 21:27.583
so Crud will never
be able to come back.

21:34.333 --> 21:36.625
Christopher Robin,

21:36.625 --> 21:41.291
your room, it's--
-- it's beautiful.

21:41.291 --> 21:43.708
Uh, mm, almost.

21:43.708 --> 21:47.208
Well, I guess we'll just
have to throw this dirty sock

21:47.208 --> 21:48.375
under the bed.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.708
No way, Mom.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.000
I'm not
going to let Crud

21:51.000 --> 21:54.166
get on my stuff
ever again.

21:54.166 --> 21:56.458
Okay.

21:56.458 --> 21:58.583
Hey, time for you
to go out and play.

21:58.583 --> 22:03.000
Oh, not now, Mom.
We got to take a bath.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.375
Christopher Robin?
