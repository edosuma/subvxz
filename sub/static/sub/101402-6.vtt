WEBVTT

00:48.000 --> 00:49.048
Come on. It's a bit nice

00:49.088 --> 00:50.348
to be home, isn't it?

00:56.000 --> 00:56.938
Kim, do you mind if we have

00:56.978 --> 00:58.718
a quick chat before we go in?

01:03.000 --> 01:05.053
Oh, Mum, you left a dead deer

01:05.093 --> 01:05.980
on the porch!

01:06.020 --> 01:07.441
Well, I left in a hurry,

01:07.481 --> 01:08.021
didn't I?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.473
Come on, Jay, give us a hand,

01:10.513 --> 01:10.980
over here.

01:11.020 --> 01:12.000
Nick.

01:14.000 --> 01:14.980
f

01:15.020 --> 01:16.000
Ugh!

01:17.000 --> 01:17.911
Stop moaning.

01:17.951 --> 01:18.980
Get on with it.

01:19.020 --> 01:20.980
[Jay] Fucking stinks!

01:21.020 --> 01:25.000
TWO WEEKS TO LIVE

01:31.000 --> 01:32.680
So, this is the penguin, eh?

01:34.000 --> 01:34.980
Hey, little guy,

01:35.020 --> 01:36.000
nice to meet ya.

01:37.000 --> 01:37.025
d

01:37.065 --> 01:38.325
Nice to meet you too.

01:39.000 --> 01:39.980
You seem nice...

01:40.020 --> 01:41.072
and genuinely sorry

01:41.112 --> 01:42.072
about something?

01:47.000 --> 01:48.361
[in normal voice]

01:48.401 --> 01:49.214
I am sorry, Penguin.

01:49.254 --> 01:50.034
Very much so.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
God, he's filthy.

01:57.000 --> 01:57.560
When was the last time

01:57.600 --> 01:58.560
you cleaned him?

02:00.000 --> 02:00.586
Actually that's my dead

02:00.626 --> 02:01.526
father's blood.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.171
I never felt like washing it,

02:04.211 --> 02:05.411
so, thanks for that.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.980
[retches softly] Okay.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.000
[stutters] I'm just gonna...

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
Um... [sputters]

02:14.000 --> 02:14.980
[coughing, retching]

02:15.020 --> 02:16.000
[vomiting]

02:17.000 --> 02:17.980
[Tina] Right.

02:18.020 --> 02:19.520
Let's get this fire lit

02:19.560 --> 02:20.980
and the shutters down.

02:21.020 --> 02:21.980
[Kim] Great idea.

02:22.020 --> 02:23.404
It may not look like much,

02:23.444 --> 02:25.184
guys, but we'll be safe here.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.221
There's not a soul for miles.

02:27.261 --> 02:28.341
No one'll find us.

02:29.000 --> 02:29.603
-We are completely alone.

02:29.643 --> 02:30.543
-[bell dinging]

02:38.000 --> 02:38.480
[Jay] Whoa, whoa,

02:38.520 --> 02:39.540
what's happening?

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
[gun cocking]

02:51.000 --> 02:51.980
[Jay] Beth?

02:52.020 --> 02:53.049
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

02:53.089 --> 02:53.980
what you doing?

02:54.020 --> 02:55.160
Put your guns down.

02:56.000 --> 02:56.980
Hi.

02:57.020 --> 02:58.985
Ah, welcome, Beth.

02:59.025 --> 03:00.192
So nice to finally

03:00.232 --> 03:00.980
meet you.

03:01.020 --> 03:02.980
[Tina] Shit.

03:03.020 --> 03:03.577
-[sighs]

03:03.617 --> 03:05.000
-Are you all right?

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Kim.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.140
[Beth] What's that?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.435
[Brooks] So, we should have

03:34.475 --> 03:35.980
enough firepower.

03:36.020 --> 03:37.546
But the problem is gonna be

03:37.586 --> 03:39.086
getting down to the cabin

03:40.000 --> 03:40.980
without them seeing us.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.016
Well, my mum always said that

03:43.056 --> 03:43.709
a problem is just a solution

03:43.749 --> 03:44.980
that hasn't been found yet.

03:45.020 --> 03:45.710
Well, your mum's an idiot,

03:45.750 --> 03:46.350
isn't she?

03:47.000 --> 03:47.980
Wow.

03:48.020 --> 03:49.063
Well, if the solution

03:49.103 --> 03:49.980
hasn't been found,

03:50.020 --> 03:50.741
then it's a fucking problem,

03:50.781 --> 03:50.980
isn't it?

03:51.020 --> 03:51.200
-Sir?

03:51.240 --> 03:51.980
-That's the point.

03:52.020 --> 03:53.763
There is no problem.

03:53.803 --> 03:54.682
It's just a solution that

03:54.722 --> 03:55.980
hasn't been found yet.

03:56.020 --> 03:56.980
Which is a problem.

03:57.020 --> 03:58.669
In fact, it's the exact

03:58.709 --> 03:59.273
fucking definition

03:59.313 --> 03:59.980
of a problem.

04:00.020 --> 04:00.569
-Jesus!

04:00.609 --> 04:00.980
-Sir?

04:01.020 --> 04:02.017
We're just gonna have to agree

04:02.057 --> 04:03.737
to disagree then, aren't we?

04:05.000 --> 04:06.451
-Are your feet all right,

04:06.491 --> 04:06.693
Thompson?

04:06.733 --> 04:06.980
-What?

04:07.020 --> 04:07.592
'Cause you're getting awfully

04:07.632 --> 04:07.980
big for your boots.

04:08.020 --> 04:09.514
-You know that, don't you?

04:09.554 --> 04:09.980
-[sighs]

04:10.020 --> 04:11.520
Sorry, are we boring you?

04:12.000 --> 04:12.451
This is the path

04:12.491 --> 04:12.980
to the house, sir.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.485
We need to follow

04:14.525 --> 04:14.919
tactical protocol

04:14.959 --> 04:16.099
from this point on.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.080
Well, go on, then.

04:21.000 --> 04:21.464
Where does Terri

04:21.504 --> 04:21.980
find these goons?

04:22.020 --> 04:23.695
I basically feel like we'd be

04:23.735 --> 04:24.980
better off on our own.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.000
Hmm.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.457
-[cord twangs]

04:28.497 --> 04:28.980
-Huh?

04:29.020 --> 04:30.000
[man grunts]

04:37.000 --> 04:38.351
-Here you go.

04:38.391 --> 04:38.980
-Wh...

04:39.020 --> 04:40.516
Why are we having sandwiches?

04:40.556 --> 04:41.980
We need to leave, right now.

04:42.020 --> 04:42.988
If you leave now you'll only

04:43.028 --> 04:43.980
get yourself in more danger.

04:44.020 --> 04:45.980
Kim's right.

04:46.020 --> 04:47.046
Yeah, the traps will slow

04:47.086 --> 04:47.399
them down, but they'll

04:47.439 --> 04:47.980
be here pretty soon.

04:48.020 --> 04:49.365
Our best bet is fighting them

04:49.405 --> 04:49.980
on home turf.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.000
Definitely. I agree with Kim.

04:53.000 --> 04:53.980
Jesus.

04:54.020 --> 04:54.980
Who are you people?

04:55.020 --> 04:55.900
I'm really sorry that

04:55.940 --> 04:56.980
you're in this situation.

04:57.020 --> 04:58.516
But right now, I'm gonna

04:58.556 --> 04:59.384
need you to go and hide

04:59.424 --> 04:59.980
out the back

05:00.020 --> 05:00.513
while I set some bear traps

05:00.553 --> 05:01.993
and clean out the canon.

05:02.000 --> 05:02.980
[Nicky] I'll come and help.

05:03.020 --> 05:04.555
-Nicky, you stay here.

05:04.595 --> 05:04.980
-Sure.

05:05.020 --> 05:06.075
Mum, hold the fort

05:06.115 --> 05:07.015
until I'm back.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.000
[exhales]

05:28.000 --> 05:29.140
[breathing heavily]

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
[Nicky] Kim.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.980
Go back, Nicky.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.230
-We need to talk.

05:48.270 --> 05:48.971
-No, seriously, you need

05:49.011 --> 05:49.980
to go back right now.

05:50.020 --> 05:51.001
-I just wanted to apologize

05:51.041 --> 05:51.576
for the whole diary thing.

05:51.616 --> 05:51.980
-No, I'm fine.

05:52.020 --> 05:53.072
-Please, you just have to

05:53.112 --> 05:53.431
stop walking right...

05:53.471 --> 05:54.551
-[landmine clicks]

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
...now.

05:57.000 --> 05:58.000
[sighs]

06:06.000 --> 06:07.980
Why didn't you tell me?

06:08.020 --> 06:08.980
I tried to sort it.

06:09.020 --> 06:09.948
I even went to the police

06:09.988 --> 06:10.980
and look where that got me?

06:11.020 --> 06:13.000
Well, you could have told me.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.500
Okay, and what about you?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
I know about the baby, Beth.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.240
I mean, why didn't you

06:34.280 --> 06:35.060
just tell me?

06:38.000 --> 06:40.000
That's why I came here.

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
To tell you.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
[Jay sighs]

06:52.000 --> 06:53.020
I'm really sorry.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.140
I was freaking out.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.208
And then I thought

07:01.248 --> 07:02.980
"Well, if I'm freaking out

07:03.020 --> 07:03.452
he's definitely

07:03.492 --> 07:04.512
gonna freak out."

07:10.000 --> 07:10.980
[clicks tongue, sighs]

07:11.020 --> 07:12.209
Okay. Can I ask you to promise

07:12.249 --> 07:13.389
me something, Beth?

07:17.000 --> 07:17.917
If you promise

07:17.957 --> 07:19.000
to still love me

07:20.000 --> 07:21.015
even if I don't fucking make

07:21.055 --> 07:21.980
anything of myself, then--

07:22.020 --> 07:23.319
-Babe, of course, I'll--

07:23.359 --> 07:23.980
-No, no, no.

07:24.020 --> 07:26.000
If you can promise me that,

07:27.000 --> 07:28.449
then I'll promise to give

07:28.489 --> 07:29.980
everything I've got to you

07:30.020 --> 07:34.000
and that, our baby.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.551
Every single fucking thing,

07:37.591 --> 07:39.000
I swear to God.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.387
So you're not

07:44.427 --> 07:44.980
freaking out, then?

07:45.020 --> 07:46.980
I'm freaking in, mate.

07:47.020 --> 07:49.000
[both laughing]

07:51.000 --> 07:52.560
[Tina] All right, you two.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.000
[gun cocking]

07:57.000 --> 07:57.980
Take this.

07:58.020 --> 08:00.000
You're gonna need it.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
[exhales]

08:03.000 --> 08:04.394
-That killed the moment,

08:04.434 --> 08:04.693
didn't it?

08:04.733 --> 08:05.233
-Yeah.

08:06.000 --> 08:07.000
Fucking hell.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.000
[exhales]

08:20.000 --> 08:21.980
[Kim] Okay, so, the thing is,

08:22.020 --> 08:23.980
I made these landmines myself

08:24.020 --> 08:24.958
and it looks like

08:24.998 --> 08:25.980
it's malfunctioned

08:26.020 --> 08:27.869
-but I do want to disarm it

08:27.909 --> 08:28.472
just to be sure.

08:28.512 --> 08:28.980
-Mmm-hmm.

08:29.020 --> 08:30.232
Two things while I'm getting

08:30.272 --> 08:30.980
the wire cutters:

08:31.020 --> 08:32.580
One, don't lift your foot.

08:33.000 --> 08:33.980
And two,

08:34.020 --> 08:35.156
please don't tell my mum

08:35.196 --> 08:36.216
it malfunctioned.

08:37.000 --> 08:37.980
[sighs]

08:38.020 --> 08:40.000
Mums are the worst, right?

08:44.000 --> 08:45.165
[sighs] Look, I'm sorry

08:45.205 --> 08:46.165
about the diary.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.000
I really am.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
Just...

08:52.000 --> 08:52.923
don't let your mum use this

08:52.963 --> 08:54.763
as an excuse to keep you here.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.000
Please.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.320
Stay here. Don't move.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.033
I'm gonna go and check

09:04.073 --> 09:04.980
what fuse I've used,

09:05.020 --> 09:06.370
and if everything's fine

09:06.410 --> 09:07.980
I'll just shout the words...

09:08.020 --> 09:09.000
"Jammy Dodgers"?

09:11.000 --> 09:11.980
Exactly.

09:12.020 --> 09:12.929
Then you'll know

09:12.969 --> 09:14.049
it's safe to move.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.200
See you in a minute.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.000
You all right, pickle?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.000
[gasps]

09:39.000 --> 09:40.450
Oh, um, those bomb fuses

09:40.490 --> 09:41.980
you got me for Christmas,

09:42.020 --> 09:42.931
they weren't

09:42.971 --> 09:43.799
the pressure-release kind,

09:43.839 --> 09:44.980
by any chance, were they?

09:45.020 --> 09:46.860
Yeah, but I built in

09:46.818 --> 09:48.138
for training purposes.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.000
a time delay

09:49.000 --> 09:49.980
[softly] Oh, thank God.

09:50.020 --> 09:50.980
How long?

09:51.020 --> 09:53.000
Why? What's happened?

09:54.000 --> 09:56.000
Nothing. Everything's fine.

10:03.000 --> 10:03.460
-Mum, wait!

10:03.500 --> 10:04.220
-Oh, my God.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
He's... such a loser.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.480
Look at him.

10:10.520 --> 10:10.886
I bet that's

10:10.926 --> 10:11.980
how he dances.

10:12.020 --> 10:12.980
I mean, seriously,

10:13.020 --> 10:14.344
I know I messed up,

10:14.384 --> 10:15.055
but you're really gonna

10:15.095 --> 10:16.235
choose him over me?

10:19.000 --> 10:20.007
How is it possible

10:20.047 --> 10:20.980
to know so little

10:21.020 --> 10:22.257
about the only person

10:22.297 --> 10:22.334
in the world

10:22.334 --> 10:23.414
you actually know?

10:31.000 --> 10:32.000
d

10:43.000 --> 10:44.560
[Nicky chuckles nervously]

10:46.000 --> 10:46.980
I'm so sorry.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.000
What?

10:49.000 --> 10:50.080
[Brooks] Uh-uh-uh.

11:25.000 --> 11:26.740
We're gonna take our chances.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Go the... the back way.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I'm sorry.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.140
It's like you said.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.647
Nothing else matters now,

11:43.687 --> 11:45.000
apart from this kid.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
[clicks tongue] And that's it.

11:52.000 --> 11:53.380
Tina, I'm really sorry.

11:54.000 --> 11:55.000
No, no.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Don't be sorry.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.057
Kim, there's something

12:16.097 --> 12:16.980
I need to tell you.

12:17.020 --> 12:18.760
[Brooks] You all right, mate?

12:19.000 --> 12:20.000
Long time.

12:21.000 --> 12:21.586
I like what you've done

12:21.626 --> 12:22.526
with the place.

12:23.000 --> 12:23.863
Rustic setting.

12:23.903 --> 12:25.043
Crazy killer traps.

12:26.000 --> 12:27.000
It's nice.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.500
[man] Don't fucking move.

12:34.000 --> 12:34.534
[Tina] Are you okay?

12:34.574 --> 12:35.534
Has he hurt you?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.193
Good to see the little one

12:38.233 --> 12:39.253
all grown up too.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.980
What's he talking about?

12:41.020 --> 12:42.320
Boyfriend's a bit of a dick,

12:42.360 --> 12:42.980
though, right?

12:43.020 --> 12:44.559
Oh. We're not actually

12:44.599 --> 12:45.091
a couple. So, joke's

12:45.131 --> 12:45.980
on you. [chuckles]

12:46.020 --> 12:47.398
I mean, there was a kiss

12:47.438 --> 12:47.938
but it got ruined 'cause of

12:47.978 --> 12:48.980
this whole diary list thing.

12:49.020 --> 12:49.823
Anyway, basically,

12:49.863 --> 12:50.451
this whole thing happened

12:50.491 --> 12:50.980
with this book--

12:51.020 --> 12:51.850
-Do you wanna

12:51.890 --> 12:52.324
shut the fuck up?

12:52.364 --> 12:53.264
-Mmm-hmm. Sure.

12:54.000 --> 12:54.980
What's wrong with the kid?

12:55.020 --> 12:56.000
I know, right?

12:57.000 --> 12:57.480
Wait, do you two

12:57.520 --> 12:58.480
know each other?

13:02.000 --> 13:02.839
Me and your mum

13:02.879 --> 13:03.980
used to be partners,

13:04.020 --> 13:05.000
didn't we, Jo?

13:06.000 --> 13:07.000
Jo?

13:09.000 --> 13:10.000
Please don't.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Rising star of the force.

13:14.000 --> 13:15.437
So good, in fact,

13:15.477 --> 13:15.745
that she found out

13:15.785 --> 13:17.285
I was on Jimmy's payroll.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.800
Didn't you, you little monkey?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.533
So, I did what any good partner

13:25.573 --> 13:25.980
would do.

13:26.020 --> 13:27.040
And I cut her in.

13:28.000 --> 13:28.692
And business was good,

13:28.732 --> 13:29.272
trust me.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.764
It wasn't like that, Kim.

13:31.804 --> 13:32.091
I did it for him.

13:32.131 --> 13:32.980
He was my partner.

13:33.020 --> 13:33.555
He would've gone to prison

13:33.595 --> 13:33.980
for years otherwise.

13:34.020 --> 13:34.987
You did it for the money,

13:35.027 --> 13:35.980
just like the rest of us.

13:36.020 --> 13:38.980
No. He begged me, Kim.

13:39.020 --> 13:41.000
But you took the money?

13:42.000 --> 13:43.000
[sighs]

13:44.000 --> 13:45.500
Just like the rest of us.

13:46.000 --> 13:46.980
[Tina] Kim, listen to me.

13:47.020 --> 13:48.098
Things got out of control

13:48.138 --> 13:49.338
really, really fast.

13:50.000 --> 13:50.922
I tried to get out but

13:50.962 --> 13:52.462
then Jimmy came after me.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.980
Yeah, he came after you.

13:55.020 --> 13:56.543
But you're not who he found,

13:56.583 --> 13:57.083
are you?

14:03.000 --> 14:04.000
He found Dad?

14:06.000 --> 14:07.117
[Tina] We were gonna leave

14:07.157 --> 14:08.357
that night, but I...

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
I was one day too late.

14:15.000 --> 14:15.921
This whole thing

14:15.961 --> 14:17.041
is because of you?

14:21.000 --> 14:23.000
Dad died because of you.

14:24.000 --> 14:25.000
[crying]

14:34.000 --> 14:35.000
[sighs]

14:41.000 --> 14:41.980
Okay. [sniffles]

14:42.020 --> 14:43.000
Okay.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.008
Next time you move,

14:46.048 --> 14:47.128
this gun goes off.

14:49.000 --> 14:49.917
-Good to know.

15:34.000 --> 15:35.000
[Jay] Fuck.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.680

f

15:57.000 --> 15:58.980
I'm fine.

15:59.020 --> 16:00.065
If you bleed out now, Mum,

16:00.105 --> 16:00.429
I won't get the chance

16:00.469 --> 16:00.980
to kill you myself,

16:01.020 --> 16:02.980
now hold it!

16:03.020 --> 16:04.000
[gunshots]

16:08.000 --> 16:09.077
[Jay] Yo! Yo, yo!

16:09.117 --> 16:09.397
I'm coming out

16:09.437 --> 16:09.980
with the bag.

16:10.020 --> 16:11.000
Stop shooting.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.000
d

16:16.000 --> 16:17.414
All right. All right,

16:17.454 --> 16:19.000
here's the money, yeah?

16:21.000 --> 16:21.980
This is what you came here for.

16:22.020 --> 16:25.000
So, just...

16:28.000 --> 16:29.620
Just take it and go, innit?

16:30.000 --> 16:31.000
"Isn't it."

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Hey, Nick. Guess what?

16:36.000 --> 16:36.980
Beth's pregnant.

16:37.020 --> 16:38.655
-[both chuckle]

16:38.695 --> 16:39.246
-Oh, my God.

16:39.286 --> 16:39.980
That's...

16:40.020 --> 16:41.980
Beth, congratulations!

16:42.020 --> 16:42.980
[Beth] Thanks, Nicky!

16:43.020 --> 16:45.000
I thought you were glowing.

16:46.000 --> 16:46.980
Aww.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.064
Well, get up here up

16:48.104 --> 16:48.473
and give me a hug

16:48.513 --> 16:48.980
then or what?

16:49.020 --> 16:50.574
Yeah, no, I would,

16:50.614 --> 16:50.996
but I'm stood on

16:51.036 --> 16:52.056
a landmine. So...

16:53.000 --> 16:53.980
What?

16:54.020 --> 16:55.000
[gunshots]

16:56.000 --> 16:56.500
-Idiot!

16:56.540 --> 16:58.000
-[Jay] Fuck my life!

17:05.000 --> 17:06.680
[Brooks] Go and get it then.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
You go and get it.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.000
You lied to me, Mum.

17:17.000 --> 17:18.980
My whole life is a lie.

17:19.020 --> 17:20.980
Please, don't say that.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.469
Why would you keep this

17:22.509 --> 17:23.000
from me?

17:31.000 --> 17:32.000
[sighs]

17:33.000 --> 17:34.140
Because I love you.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.200
And I only love you.

17:40.000 --> 17:40.913
There's nothing else.

17:40.953 --> 17:41.980
There's no other people.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.000
No other places. It's just you.

17:56.000 --> 17:56.540
Did you ever think maybe

17:56.580 --> 17:57.720
that's the problem?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
No, I didn't.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
[Brooks] Thompson. Cover me.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
[breathing heavily]

18:25.000 --> 18:25.980
Mum!

18:26.020 --> 18:26.980
Wait here.

18:27.020 --> 18:28.980
Mum!

18:29.020 --> 18:30.000
Jo.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
What are doing, Jo?

18:34.000 --> 18:35.000
[panting]

18:36.000 --> 18:37.496
No one else needs to die today,

18:37.536 --> 18:38.136
all right?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.000
Jimmy's dead.

18:42.000 --> 18:43.980
I'm out. I'm done.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.233
So, let's just put

18:46.273 --> 18:48.000
the guns down.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.020
What about Terri?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.677
I'll tell her that Kim stood on

18:57.717 --> 18:59.157
a landmine or something.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.000
Listen...

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
Jo.

19:06.000 --> 19:08.000
You let me take this money,

19:09.000 --> 19:09.561
and you will never

19:09.601 --> 19:10.381
see us again.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
I swear.

19:22.000 --> 19:22.980
Cross my heart.

-And hope to--

19:31.000 --> 19:32.000
Now then,

19:33.000 --> 19:33.959
I'm afraid I'm going to need

19:33.999 --> 19:35.739
to take a body back to Terri.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.260
So who's it gonna be?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Mum, don't!

19:46.000 --> 19:47.140
[Thompson chuckles]

19:49.000 --> 19:50.033
Throw your gun down,

19:50.073 --> 19:50.980
and come out, Kim!

19:51.020 --> 19:53.000
Stay exactly where you are.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.006
I tell you what, Kim.

19:55.046 --> 19:56.246
I'll let you decide.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
Your mum or this dweeb.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.936
You've got three seconds

20:04.976 --> 20:06.536
or I just shoot them both.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.000
Three.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
Two.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Fuck.

20:19.000 --> 20:19.889
-One.

20:19.929 --> 20:20.980
-Wait!

20:21.020 --> 20:21.980
I'm the one you want!

20:22.020 --> 20:22.652
-Kim.

20:22.692 --> 20:24.000
-[gunshot]

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
I won't choose between them.

20:30.000 --> 20:30.980

20:31.020 --> 20:32.739
Because whichever one I choose,

20:32.779 --> 20:34.099
I'll still be trapped.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.000
Kim, don't.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.380
[Kim] Do what you want.

20:41.000 --> 20:44.000
Kill me, take the money,

20:45.000 --> 20:46.660
go off somewhere

20:46.700 --> 20:49.000
and eat a huge pile...

of Jammy Dodgers.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.000
Excuse me?

21:01.000 --> 21:02.860

Oh, no. [gasping]

Look.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.000
Are you shot?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.180
No, but that's really gonna

21:29.220 --> 21:29.980
sting in the bath.

shoot me in the back either.

To get away from all the lies.

The world may be a scary place.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.740
But it can also be beautiful.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.000
I'm not going to hide anymore.

22:52.000 --> 22:53.000
I am ready.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And I can look after myself.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.863
I know you thought you were

23:00.903 --> 23:02.000
keeping me safe,

23:03.000 --> 23:03.967
and I hope one day you can

23:04.007 --> 23:05.627
make this right between us.

23:08.000 --> 23:10.000
I do love you, Mum.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.105
I just don't know right now

23:13.145 --> 23:14.405
if I can forgive you.

23:19.000 --> 23:20.000
Bye, Mum.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
Love, Kim.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.067
I told you you were

23:39.107 --> 23:40.067
shit with women.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.000
Thanks.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.980
No problem, mate.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.373
You know, you're gonna be

23:46.413 --> 23:46.980
a shit dad.

23:47.020 --> 23:47.980

23:48.020 --> 23:49.570
[Nicky] It's true. He's gonna

23:49.610 --> 23:51.170
leave the baby on the bus.

24:07.000 --> 24:07.807
So, you didn't

24:07.847 --> 24:09.047
tell her everything?

24:13.000 --> 24:14.000

24:15.000 --> 24:15.980
Another day, perhaps.
