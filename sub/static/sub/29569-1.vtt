Oh.

[chuckles]

00:40.307 --> 00:41.607
Hi, Patrick.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.278
[sighs] Here you go.

00:48.416 --> 00:49.548
There you go.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.217
Oh.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.720
You're going to do great things.

00:55.322 --> 00:56.722
You're going to do great things.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.592
Ha. Yes, you are.

01:02.430 --> 01:04.129
[Santa] Ho, ho, ho.

01:04.131 --> 01:05.597
[chuckles]

01:05.599 --> 01:07.199
This is the one.

01:08.069 --> 01:08.801
Yes.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.603
Yes, you are.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.639
[festive music]

02:20.241 --> 02:23.308
[suspenseful music]

02:27.248 --> 02:28.814
[Joe] Tell me now, Patrick.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.282
How long have you been here?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.518
So I came over here
about a year ago.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.653
I worked on one of those
posh cruise liners.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.588
We did the Transatlantic for
about two and a half years

02:36.590 --> 02:38.490
between here and England.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.361
Um, I worked in the kitchen,
but to be honest,

02:42.429 --> 02:43.695
I kind of got tired
of the sailing life.

02:43.697 --> 02:46.598
So I got off and lost
in The Big Apple.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.734
-[chuckles]
-I got a job at
a Mexican restaurant,

02:48.736 --> 02:51.537
bar backed at
a couple of nightclubs,
paid under the table.

02:51.539 --> 02:52.504
It was quite nice.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.274
So, you have no papers then?

02:56.443 --> 02:58.644
Uh, no, uh, I don't, no.

02:59.613 --> 03:01.680
-Where are you from?
-From Derry.

03:01.749 --> 03:03.182
-Derry?
-Mm-hmm.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.483
Oh, family?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.352
I don't have a family, no.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.621
I was raised in an orphanage.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.356
Left when I was 18.

03:14.395 --> 03:16.195
Fred, where's my juice?!

03:16.197 --> 03:17.563
[woman] I got it, Fred.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.666
[sighs]

03:20.668 --> 03:21.800
[woman] Here you are.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.704
I'll be honest
with you now, Pat.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.805
I've not heard a sadder story
than that in many a year.

03:29.543 --> 03:34.780
Well... we look after
our own, hmm?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.251
I could use someone
to wash the glasses

03:39.253 --> 03:40.986
and maybe tidy up around here.

03:40.988 --> 03:42.721
Could you handle that?

03:42.723 --> 03:44.523
Absolutely, sir.

03:44.525 --> 03:46.558
I'd really appreciate
that, Mr. O'Brian.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.794
[chuckles] You can call me Joe.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.930
-Thank you, Joe.
-[Joe chuckling]
Can you start now?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.398
-Yes, right away, yeah.
-Right.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.566
-It's a pleasure.
-Get started, get started.

03:54.568 --> 03:55.934
Absolutely, thank you so much.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.470
Fred, come and show
young Patrick here the ropes.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.005
[Irish themed jolly music]

04:04.712 --> 04:05.744
Yeah.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.646
[guests laughing]

04:23.764 --> 04:25.330
Fred!

04:25.331 --> 04:26.897
you will do exactly
what I tell you to

04:26.900 --> 04:28.400
or you will have a problem.

04:28.402 --> 04:30.902
Now I do not have problems,
do you understand?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.371
I have solutions.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.906
Now get out of here
and do what I tell you!

04:44.018 --> 04:45.584
-You all right?
-Yeah, thanks.

04:52.493 --> 04:53.925
-7.50.
-Keep the change.

04:53.927 --> 04:54.860
Thanks.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.697
And I have to tell you, boys,
we had a very good month.

04:59.566 --> 05:00.899
Another month or two like this,

05:00.901 --> 05:03.735
and we're going to treat
ourselves to a little raise.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.737
[laughs]

05:06.573 --> 05:08.740
-Where are you going now?
-Well, I was thinking
maybe we'd take care

05:08.742 --> 05:10.442
of that little situation
over in Brooklyn first.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.046
Well, off you go, boys.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.848
-Enjoy your work.
-Thank you, boss.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.051
-[laughs]
-[light music]

05:21.989 --> 05:23.922
Does that remind you
of your family, Pat?

05:25.626 --> 05:28.760
You know, I've never
met my family.

05:30.364 --> 05:32.898
We didn't have Christmas
in the orphanage.
It was a poor parish.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.333
[woman] I didn't know.

05:34.335 --> 05:35.934
-That's rough.
-Yeah.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.670
Kind of miss home, you know?

05:38.672 --> 05:41.506
Of course you do.
Of course you do.

[whistles]

07:37.024 --> 07:40.692
Patrick, could I have
a little word with you?

07:40.694 --> 07:41.793
Yeah, sure.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.061
Be right there.

Right, right, right, right.

07:49.002 --> 07:50.602
[sighs]

07:50.604 --> 07:52.137
Pat, will you do a favor for me?

07:52.806 --> 07:55.006
Yeah, whatever you need, Joe.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.676
You've been like a father figure
these past few months, Joe.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.011
Saint Joe,
Patron Saint of Fathers.

08:00.013 --> 08:02.614
-Oh. [laughs]
-That's you, Joe.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.816
I wouldn't go that far,
I'm no Saint.

08:04.885 --> 08:07.686
No, seriously, Joe, I don't
know where I would be

08:07.688 --> 08:08.887
these past few months
without your work.

08:08.889 --> 08:10.188
So, thank you.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.024
Okay, good.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.628
[light dramatic music]

08:16.630 --> 08:20.765
I want you to take these
suitcases a couple of blocks up

08:20.767 --> 08:23.602
the road to the train station
and give them to Shaun.

08:23.604 --> 08:26.638
But no opening the suitcases,

08:26.640 --> 08:29.107
no peeping inside,
you understand?

08:29.109 --> 08:30.642
Can you do that for me?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.178
[laughs] As soon as
you've done that,

08:33.179 --> 08:35.647
I'm going to
give you 10,000 clams.

08:36.984 --> 08:40.519
That's, uh, that's a lot of
money for a few blocks, Joe.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.520
It is, it is indeed.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.656
[laughs]

08:44.658 --> 08:46.258
Let me explain,
let me explain to you.

08:47.594 --> 08:50.662
Do you know what the hardest
thing in business is, son?

08:51.932 --> 08:54.933
The hardest thing
in business, Pat,

08:56.136 --> 09:00.739
is to find people that you
can trust and I trust you.

09:04.745 --> 09:05.878
I trust you.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.012
Now, trust is
a valuable commodity,

09:07.014 --> 09:09.915
a commodity that
I am prepared to pay for.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.787
Well, uh, when do you
want me to leave?

09:15.789 --> 09:18.089
Now, tonight, this very moment.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.090
Shaun's waiting for you.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.325
But what about, where's Fred?

09:20.327 --> 09:21.593
Who's going to close the bar?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.294
I'll close the bar.

09:22.296 --> 09:23.962
Where is Fred?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.630
Fred?

09:25.632 --> 09:27.699
Don't you worry
yourself about Fred.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.267
Fred was untrustworthy.

09:29.269 --> 09:32.904
So, Fred, I had to let him go.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.107
Come on, quick, quick, quick.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.811
Ah, very good, very good.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.647
Oh, and now, a couple of
things, couple of things.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.617
First of all, you do not dote,

09:45.619 --> 09:48.253
you do not stop
and talk to anyone.

09:48.322 --> 09:52.257
And in the incredibly
remote chance

09:52.259 --> 09:55.894
that something goes wrong,
you take those bags

09:55.896 --> 09:58.730
and you run like hell
to the station, you understand?

09:58.732 --> 10:00.732
You run like hell.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.701
Off you go, quick.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.270
Sooner there,
sooner back, sooner paid.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.738
Oh, and put your jacket on.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.073
It's cold outside.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.677
[sirens wailing]

10:12.679 --> 10:14.179
[dogs barking]

10:14.181 --> 10:15.747
It's just a few blocks.

10:16.683 --> 10:17.916
[sighs]

10:17.918 --> 10:19.651
No big deal, right?

10:24.224 --> 10:25.557
It's just a few blocks.

10:25.558 --> 10:26.891
-Let's go, Pat.
It's just a few blocks.
-[Joe laughing]

10:26.893 --> 10:28.860
And don't worry if
the cops grab him,

10:28.862 --> 10:32.163
he's so pathetically grateful
to me for looking after him,

10:32.232 --> 10:33.865
that he'll go to
prison for 20 years

10:33.867 --> 10:35.934
-without opening his mouth.
-[muffled talking]

10:35.936 --> 10:37.902
There's a perfectly
reasonable explanation

10:37.904 --> 10:40.105
as to why I shouldn't
look inside.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.139
It's obviously
something important,

10:41.141 --> 10:42.807
like insurance policies or...

10:44.845 --> 10:46.077
a secret recipe for craft beer.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.414
[dramatic music]

-[gasping]
-[suspenseful music]

11:14.808 --> 11:17.776
-[Joe laughing]
-Yeah, and the lovely
thing is this,

11:17.844 --> 11:20.412
if we do have to off him,
guess what?

11:20.414 --> 11:22.047
He has no relatives.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.749
So nobody is going to
come and look for him.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.818
And here's
the icing on the cake.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.053
He's also illegal.

11:28.121 --> 11:30.789
There is no paper
trail to suggest

11:30.791 --> 11:32.090
he ever came into the country.

11:32.159 --> 11:33.725
-When you think about it,
-[guy] Hey, watch it!

11:33.727 --> 11:35.960
The boy is practically
a ghost already.

11:35.962 --> 11:37.796
[chuckling]

leaving right now?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.800
[change rattling]

11:44.871 --> 11:49.140
Bus 46 is pulling out,
heading out west.

11:49.209 --> 11:50.742
[Patrick] Yeah, that's fine.
Ticket, please.

Santa Fe, everybody off.

12:59.379 --> 13:00.545
Please check around
your own seats.

Don't leave any
belongings behind.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.584
Welcome to Ortegas.

14:47.153 --> 14:48.653
I'm Mrs. Ortega.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.255
Need a room?

14:50.257 --> 14:54.359
Yeah, well, um,
that depends, Mrs. Ortega.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.127
How much?

14:56.129 --> 14:59.964
Well, I'm having
a special for 49.99

14:59.966 --> 15:02.300
and that is breakfast included.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.169
I'll show you, follow me.

15:08.508 --> 15:09.607
You like?

15:09.609 --> 15:10.675
Uh, yes.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.344
Uh, very much.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.382
Can I have it for one night?

15:17.384 --> 15:19.083
[sighs] Only one night?

15:20.954 --> 15:22.921
Of course, why not.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.022
Yeah, my name is Pat by the way.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.141
Pat Keeley.

15:26.142 --> 15:28.259
Oh, please join me
for lunch,<i> Señor</i> Keeley.

15:28.261 --> 15:29.394
I made too much.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.195
I'm used to cooking for two.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.997
-So please?
-Oh.

15:32.999 --> 15:34.599
-You look hungry.
-I'm starving,

15:34.601 --> 15:36.200
-I just.
-[laughs]

15:38.605 --> 15:40.038
Thanks very much, Mrs. O.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.306
-Oh.
-It's very kind of you.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.009
I hate to eat alone.

15:45.011 --> 15:48.713
Ever since my husband died,
if I don't have company

15:48.715 --> 15:51.382
to eat with, I just don't eat.

15:52.519 --> 15:55.186
You saved me from self-imposed
starvation, you see?

15:56.456 --> 15:58.690
-[Mexican themed upbeat music]
-[coughing]

about going to the police

29:37.143 --> 29:38.075
Yes.

29:39.879 --> 29:41.345
Yeah.

29:41.347 --> 29:42.813
This is going
really well, Emily.

29:42.815 --> 29:44.114
[Emily] Next, okay.

29:44.116 --> 29:45.315
[Patrick] Thanks.

29:45.317 --> 29:46.950
[Emily] Thank you so much.

29:49.488 --> 29:52.022
All right. Tell Santa what
you want for Christmas?

29:54.026 --> 29:55.926
Have a good think, now,
think long and hard.

29:55.995 --> 29:57.795
And I want an airplane.

29:57.797 --> 30:01.398
One that flies,
and a speedboat, and a yacht.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.867
A yacht isn't the same thing
as a speedboat, you know.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.203
[speaking gibberish]

30:06.205 --> 30:08.105
[Patrick] Really, nice!

30:08.107 --> 30:10.240
[speaking gibberish]

30:15.347 --> 30:17.948
And a candy factory
and an elephant.

30:17.950 --> 30:20.584
A real elephant,
not one of those stuffed toys.

30:20.586 --> 30:23.053
A real live elephant.

30:23.122 --> 30:26.223
[speaking gibberish]

30:28.394 --> 30:30.460
Then it don't work,
it don't work.

30:30.529 --> 30:31.995
Merry Christmas, little buddy.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.530
What do you want from
Santa this year?

30:33.532 --> 30:34.598
Oh.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.834
He can have fire.

30:37.469 --> 30:39.369
-He has fire?
-Yeah.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.371
That's an interesting
choice of present.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.106
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.943
Uh, [clears throat],
I can't make any promises.

30:48.914 --> 30:50.280
I don't really know.

30:51.016 --> 30:51.949
You don't know?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.851
Hey, are you listening to me?

30:53.853 --> 30:56.620
Santa, I think you should
be writing this down.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.356
My dad's a lawyer, you know?
If I don't get what I want,

30:59.358 --> 31:01.558
he's going to sue
the pants off you, fat man.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.393
-[groaning]

-Yay.
-Go, Santa!

32:08.494 --> 32:10.560
Well done! Give me a hug.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.197
Merry Christmas, son.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.432
-Merry Christmas, Santa.
-Bye.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.100
Merry Christmas.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.337
Oh, wow, wow, wow.

32:20.339 --> 32:22.706
You were surprisingly
great, like,

32:22.708 --> 32:24.441
way better than that
other actor I hired.

32:26.578 --> 32:29.012
Are you up for it
again tomorrow?

32:29.014 --> 32:31.114
And, for say,
the next couple of weeks

32:31.115 --> 32:33.215
up until Christmas Eve?
Will we see you tomorrow?

32:33.218 --> 32:34.351
Please, please, please.

32:34.353 --> 32:36.720
-Sure, why not.
-Oh, thank you.

32:36.989 --> 32:39.156
-Let me get your paperwork
to fill out, okay?
-Uh, actually, Emily.

32:39.158 --> 32:42.426
Is it, is it, um, is it
okay if I take it home?

32:42.428 --> 32:44.561
Sorry, I'm just really tired,
It's been a long day.

32:44.563 --> 32:48.665
Sure, no problem.
Just make sure you bring it
back with you tomorrow, okay?

32:48.667 --> 32:50.701
-I will.
-I can't get you paid
without it, don't forget.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.102
-I won't.
-Okay.

32:52.104 --> 32:54.104
-Thank you, Emily.
-Thank you for today.

32:54.106 --> 32:55.605
-Thanks, Officer Ryan.
-[Emily sighs]

32:57.476 --> 32:59.176
Wow, wow.

32:59.178 --> 33:00.077
-Right?
-He was so good.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.011
[chuckles]

33:01.013 --> 33:02.980
-Surprised me.
-Yeah.

33:03.048 --> 33:04.748
[people talking over each other]

33:12.725 --> 33:13.724
[door clanking]

33:13.726 --> 33:15.225
-Ah!
-Ah!

33:16.228 --> 33:17.394
It's okay, Mrs. O. It's me, Pat.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.063
Oh, you gave me a fright.

33:20.065 --> 33:21.765
Sneaking up on me like that.

33:21.767 --> 33:23.567
And what with the disguise?

33:23.568 --> 33:25.368
Or are you just that taken
with the Christmas spirit?

33:26.005 --> 33:27.170
Well,

33:27.473 --> 33:29.306
I kind of got
a job today unexpectedly.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.274
The mall manager asked me
to be their Santa Claus.

33:31.276 --> 33:33.310
-[gasping]
-I know, it's just,

33:33.312 --> 33:35.012
they couldn't find one
and they were tight on time.

33:35.014 --> 33:37.014
So, I ended up
being their Santa.

33:37.649 --> 33:39.416
Yeah, I mean, I actually
worked pretty late

33:39.418 --> 33:40.784
so I just walked home.

33:40.786 --> 33:43.187
It's not that far,<i> Señora.</i>

33:43.188 --> 33:45.589
Well, we can't be without
a Santa this close to Christmas.

33:45.591 --> 33:48.792
-That is true.
-That will be a disaster.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.595
My friend, Officer Ryan,
he works at the mall too,

33:51.597 --> 33:55.232
you know, for the holidays,
for extra cash,

33:55.234 --> 33:57.801
I need to bring him
some of my green chili.

33:57.803 --> 33:59.336
It's his favorite.

34:00.172 --> 34:02.773
Yes, fantastic stuff
that green chili.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.441
[Mrs. Ortega chuckles]

34:04.443 --> 34:06.309
I'll take him some
on Christmas Eve.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.578
I know he's working that night.

34:08.580 --> 34:11.047
Hmm, that will cheer him.

34:11.750 --> 34:15.217
[chuckles nervously] I ran into
that good officer today.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.753
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah, he's memorable, that one.

34:16.755 --> 34:18.455
-Hmm.
-You know, ma'am,
I have actually

34:18.456 --> 34:20.389
a couple of things to do
in my room. So, I'll just
catch you later.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.324
Would you like something to eat?

34:22.327 --> 34:24.393
Uh, no thanks, ma'am.
It's okay, thank you, thanks.

34:24.396 --> 34:25.978
Okay, well, I'm going
to retire myself.

34:25.980 --> 34:27.563
-It's been a long day.
-Okay.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.268
[light suspenseful music]

34:40.212 --> 34:41.844
[thudding]

34:46.618 --> 34:49.252
Well, hey, where is he?
He could be anywhere.

34:49.254 --> 34:51.388
Yeah, not too many places
to hide in this town.

34:51.389 --> 34:53.590
It's the size of
a postage stamp.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.425
Well, that's--
yeah, if he's still even here.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.094
Oh, he's here, the boss just
texted a little a while ago.

34:57.096 --> 34:59.696
Said that kid called from
a 505 area code again,

34:59.698 --> 35:01.631
that rat's here
somewhere I can feel it.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.467
Well, I mean, let's go
to where the action is,

35:03.469 --> 35:04.835
maybe he's trying to lose
himself in a crowd.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.236
Well, there's some
lights down there,

35:06.238 --> 35:07.571
that must be the center
of this village

35:07.573 --> 35:08.805
or whatever they call it.

35:08.807 --> 35:10.774
Maybe there's a restaurant,
I'm starving.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.309
[Jim] Hold your horses,
we'll eat later.

35:12.311 --> 35:14.144
-[Seb] I could eat a horse.
-You're sick.

35:14.146 --> 35:15.278
[Seb] Well, I think
I ate one once.

35:15.347 --> 35:16.847
[triumphant music]

35:24.423 --> 35:26.456

35:53.886 --> 35:55.886
All right, you're off to a Merry
Christmas, darling, yeah?

35:55.888 --> 35:57.187
-Have a good one.
-Thank you.

35:57.189 --> 35:58.288
-Bye, now.
-Bye now.

35:58.290 --> 35:59.222
See you.

35:59.858 --> 36:01.291
You need a little break?

36:01.293 --> 36:02.325
Yeah, okay.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.527
[sighs]

36:03.529 --> 36:05.896
Santa will be back
in 15 minutes, kids.

36:05.898 --> 36:07.397
-Okay?
-[kids groaning]

36:07.399 --> 36:08.865
Come on, let's go get
you some hot chocolate.

36:08.867 --> 36:10.400
I know Santa will be right back.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.636
He just, he needs
a little break.

36:12.638 --> 36:15.739
<i> ¶ Oh, what fun it is</i>
<i> To ride in a one horse-- ¶</i>

36:15.741 --> 36:17.574
[Emily] Here you go,
here's your hot chocolate.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.576
Thank you,
that's very kind of you.

36:20.612 --> 36:22.345
You are really
very great with them.

36:22.347 --> 36:24.281
I am so happy you
agreed to do this.

36:24.283 --> 36:27.584
I mean, we were in a real pinch.

36:27.586 --> 36:29.853
Emily, I'm actually loving this.

36:29.922 --> 36:31.655
-Yeah?
-I'm having a great time.

36:31.657 --> 36:32.622
-Yeah.
-I'm really glad.

36:32.624 --> 36:33.790
-Yes.
-Oh, do you have

36:33.792 --> 36:35.358
your employee
paperwork filled out?

36:36.962 --> 36:38.695
Uh, no, I don't, no.

36:38.697 --> 36:42.499
Oh, Pat, I need your tax form
completed so I can pay you.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.768
No, [stuttering],
you don't need to pay me.

36:44.770 --> 36:46.403
I'm happy to
volunteer, honestly.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.271
-I really am.
-I can't let you do that.

36:48.273 --> 36:50.307
I mean, I practically kidnapped
you against your will

36:50.309 --> 36:51.908
to do this in the first place.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.978
Emily, look at it as a friend
helping a friend, yeah?

36:54.980 --> 36:58.281
Christmas gift. Me helping
the damsel in distress.

36:59.351 --> 37:01.618
That is really,
very generous of you.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.254
I mean, we're taking up
so much of your time.

37:05.290 --> 37:08.291
Look, please, can I at
least take you to dinner?

37:09.761 --> 37:11.828
Um, yeah.

37:11.830 --> 37:13.530
Sure, why not?

37:13.532 --> 37:14.965
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

37:14.967 --> 37:17.300
Yeah, great. Uh, we can have
dinner tomorrow night.

37:17.302 --> 37:19.002
It's Sunday and we close early.

37:19.004 --> 37:21.504
Uh, meet me at the plaza,
let's say six o'clock?

37:23.675 --> 37:25.542
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

37:31.283 --> 37:32.015
[Emily] Hmm.

37:34.886 --> 37:35.986
Should we go?

37:35.988 --> 37:38.755
-Yes, yes, goin' now.
-Yeah.

37:38.757 --> 37:39.756
[Emily] Just go to the kids.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.991
-Beard.
-Oh, yeah.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.426
-Yup, see you out there.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.866
[Patrick] What am
I going to do now?

37:50.636 --> 37:52.569
Can't go out with Emily
wearing the Santa suit.

37:53.338 --> 37:54.971
What if someone recognizes me?

37:55.040 --> 37:56.740
[soft music]

38:03.582 --> 38:05.482
[Patrick] Mrs. Ortega, I'm back.

38:19.898 --> 38:21.598
Oh, Mrs. Ortega.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.403
I'm sorry,<i> Señor</i> Pat.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.806
I normally don't do this.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.778
But this time of the year...

38:38.717 --> 38:40.817
I'm so lonely.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.886
[sniffling]

38:43.822 --> 38:47.424

can't go to church.

41:35.660 --> 41:37.026
It's a sanctuary.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.232
So I suppose I'm here
for that, a sanctuary.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.001
Santa Fe in English
means holy faith.

41:46.538 --> 41:49.038
So I think it's unlikely
you'll find any monsters

41:49.040 --> 41:50.607
in such a holy city.

41:52.511 --> 41:55.879
Tell me, are you a man
of faith, my son?

41:57.682 --> 41:59.015
I was raised in
a church, Father.

41:59.017 --> 42:01.985
But I haven't been
here in years.

42:01.987 --> 42:03.086
It's okay.

42:03.088 --> 42:04.621
You're here now.

42:05.891 --> 42:07.056
Oh, [chuckles],

42:07.792 --> 42:10.059
I'm Padre Esteban, by the way.

42:10.061 --> 42:11.794
Pat.

42:14.266 --> 42:15.965
You seem troubled, Pat.

42:16.968 --> 42:18.201
You want to talk about it?

42:19.204 --> 42:20.937
I'm a good listener.

42:20.939 --> 42:22.705
It's part of the job.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.542
-[light music]
-Well... [sighs]

42:27.646 --> 42:29.612
I've gotten myself into
a real pickle, Father.

42:30.649 --> 42:31.981
That's my fault.

42:33.318 --> 42:35.818
I did something
I knew it was wrong,

42:35.820 --> 42:37.186
but I agreed to do it anyway.

42:38.857 --> 42:39.989
And now I'm in trouble.

42:39.991 --> 42:41.758
Real trouble.

42:41.760 --> 42:43.126
Then why did you do it?

42:45.063 --> 42:46.129
Because...

42:47.332 --> 42:50.600
this man,
he was the closest thing

42:50.602 --> 42:52.735
I've ever known to a father.

42:52.804 --> 42:56.639
Actually cared about me,
for me, wanted the best for me.

42:58.143 --> 42:59.742
I thought he was a good guy.

43:03.615 --> 43:04.881
I just feel like a fool.

43:07.118 --> 43:12.221
People will disappoint,
but you must remember, Pat.

43:12.223 --> 43:14.724
Equally, people
will not disappoint.

43:15.627 --> 43:18.194
In fact, they will surprise
you with their kindness

43:18.196 --> 43:19.896
and the willingness to help you.

43:21.700 --> 43:24.634
And you, you shouldn't
feel like a fool.

43:26.338 --> 43:30.607
It sounds to me you did
this act, whatever it is,

43:30.609 --> 43:34.777
out of love and that
never makes you a fool.

43:34.779 --> 43:36.045
But I am a fool, Father.

43:36.114 --> 43:37.647
[chuckles]

43:37.649 --> 43:39.182
All you have to do for help...

43:40.952 --> 43:42.118
is ask.

43:44.089 --> 43:46.990
After all, this is
the city of holy faith.

43:47.993 --> 43:49.993
So have faith, Pat, hmm?

43:52.697 --> 43:53.896
What about you, Father?

43:56.067 --> 43:58.301
I mean, if you're
the one always doing

43:58.303 --> 44:00.937
all the listening,
who listens to you?

44:01.673 --> 44:04.073
[chuckles] No one's
ever asked me that.

44:05.076 --> 44:06.876
-[laughs]
-[sighs] Go on, Father.

44:07.812 --> 44:09.278
Try me, go on,
who listens to you?

44:10.148 --> 44:11.280
What's going on?

44:11.950 --> 44:12.982
Okay.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.119
Here goes young Pat, hmm.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.390
Our parishioners have not
been able to donate very much

44:20.392 --> 44:22.291
at all this year
for the toy drive.

44:23.328 --> 44:26.963
We try to put on a big
Christmas celebration

44:26.965 --> 44:28.965
for the less fortunate
children in town.

44:28.967 --> 44:30.933
[Patrick] Mm.

44:30.935 --> 44:33.803
[sighs] Especially those
who do not have families,

44:34.973 --> 44:40.143
but this year, hmm, I don't
know what we're going to do.

44:42.847 --> 44:44.914
-You seem troubled, Father?
-I am.

44:47.886 --> 44:50.186
They so look forward
to this all year.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.790
For some of them, it's all
they have to look forward to.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.426
And I confess... [chuckling]

44:58.129 --> 45:00.830
...it gives me joy to
do this for them.

45:01.866 --> 45:06.869
My heart aches for them all,
but when I see the happiness

45:06.871 --> 45:10.406
on their faces
then I know it helps.

45:12.210 --> 45:14.444
So, what will you do?

45:14.446 --> 45:17.780
Pray and I believe

45:18.750 --> 45:20.216
God will provide.

45:22.053 --> 45:25.855
After all, Father, it's a city
of holy faith now, isn't it?

45:26.858 --> 45:28.958
-[light music]
-[chuckles]

45:30.261 --> 45:32.061
Thank you, my son.

45:33.998 --> 45:36.933
[Jim] Now that's
what I call a church.

45:36.935 --> 45:38.468
Look at that. [chuckles]

45:38.470 --> 45:40.303
-Come on, let's go in.
-Hey, wait, wait, wait.

45:40.305 --> 45:42.305
-Let's go get a churro.
-What's a churro?

45:42.307 --> 45:45.942
I don't know, but, you know,
it's going to be sweet,
it's going to be great.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.477
-No, no. Come on.
-And I'm starving. Come on.

45:47.479 --> 45:48.945
Come on, man.

45:50.248 --> 45:51.314
[suspenseful music]

45:51.316 --> 45:52.782
Hey, how are ya?

45:52.784 --> 45:54.851
-Two churros please?
-One churro, I don't--

45:54.853 --> 45:56.185
-Come on, man.
-I don't want one.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.788
[Seb] You haven't eaten
in like, three hours.

45:58.790 --> 46:00.423
That's crazy.

46:00.425 --> 46:01.791
Here you go.

46:01.793 --> 46:03.126
Oh, it's warm,
this is excellent.

46:04.329 --> 46:05.828
-It's like a donut, but--
-Yeah.

46:05.830 --> 46:07.396
[Seb] You know like,
um, cinnamon--

46:07.398 --> 46:08.998
-Come on.
-Churros.

46:10.135 --> 46:11.300
You don't want a bite?

46:14.906 --> 46:16.172
[trashcan thudding]

46:16.174 --> 46:20.476
Hey. Let's see if
we can lift some prints
off these at the lab.

46:20.478 --> 46:23.212
Yeah, these knuckleheads
are around here somewhere.

46:24.015 --> 46:26.482
<i> ¶ Jingle bells, jingle bells ¶</i>

46:26.484 --> 46:29.085

[cheering]

47:26.010 --> 47:28.044
-I actually love it.
-Merry Christmas, kids.

47:28.980 --> 47:30.446
Merry Christmas.

47:30.448 --> 47:32.882
Well done, Merry Christmas.

47:32.884 --> 47:34.116
[chiming]

47:34.185 --> 47:36.152
[Emily] So, yeah,
my folks on the mall,

47:36.154 --> 47:38.254
I'm in charge of marketing
and PR of special events,

47:38.256 --> 47:40.056
you know, stuff like that.

47:40.058 --> 47:41.958
I've been doing it now
for about two years.

47:41.960 --> 47:43.993
Well, since I graduated
college anyways.

47:43.995 --> 47:45.995
-Wow, college.
-Yeah.

47:46.064 --> 47:48.598
-Very fancy.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

47:48.600 --> 47:52.168
I didn't go to college actually,
I mean, I didn't like school.

47:52.170 --> 47:53.936
I wasn't very good at math.

47:53.938 --> 47:56.906
I hated history, um, the less
I learned religion, the better.

47:56.975 --> 47:58.341
[Emily laughing]

47:58.343 --> 48:01.510
[Emily] Well, there
must have been something
in school you liked.

48:01.512 --> 48:02.912
Singing.

48:02.914 --> 48:04.413
-Huh.
-I like singing.

48:04.415 --> 48:07.283
I grew up singing in the church
choir, made me feel useful.

48:09.554 --> 48:13.055
Hmm, well, I'm sure that made
your parents very proud.

48:13.992 --> 48:15.391
Yeah.

48:15.393 --> 48:17.593
I, uh, don't have parents.

48:19.497 --> 48:21.998
So in my country,
in Northern Ireland,

48:22.000 --> 48:25.101
we had a thing called
The Troubles, and my dad died

48:25.103 --> 48:27.203
in a war-type activity.

48:27.205 --> 48:30.940
My mom was pregnant with me
at that time so she gave me up.

48:32.911 --> 48:34.644
So... [sighs]

48:34.646 --> 48:37.146
...yeah, that's
what I've been told anyway.

48:37.148 --> 48:39.048
There you have it.

48:39.050 --> 48:42.919
Well, I am sure your parents
would be very proud of you.

48:43.688 --> 48:45.955
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

48:46.024 --> 48:47.256
Hey, I know what you need.

48:47.258 --> 48:48.624
[Patrick] Hmm.

48:48.626 --> 48:50.693
-Hot cider.
-I like cider.

48:50.695 --> 48:52.228
-You do?
-I do.

48:52.230 --> 48:53.596
Okay. I'll be right back
with two cups, don't move.

48:53.598 --> 48:54.563
-I will not.
-Okay.

48:54.565 --> 48:56.065
You will find me right here.

48:57.335 --> 48:58.534
Freezing cold.

49:00.638 --> 49:01.704
Really cold.

49:05.043 --> 49:07.510
[light music]

49:16.220 --> 49:18.421
I can't keep this
charade up much longer.

49:21.426 --> 49:23.392
Please help me.

49:23.394 --> 49:25.695
-I'm running out of ideas.
-[chiming]

49:27.465 --> 49:29.632
I love this time
of year, don't you?

49:31.502 --> 49:33.102
Didn't used to.

49:34.105 --> 49:35.037
Really?

49:37.308 --> 49:38.441
What changed?

49:41.679 --> 49:45.147
-I became Santa this year.
-[chuckles]

49:45.149 --> 49:47.383
You let me know
if I can help out, kiddo.

49:51.689 --> 49:53.589
You're such a charming guy.
You've been in town
such a short time

49:53.591 --> 49:55.257
and you already have friends.

49:55.259 --> 49:57.193
Yeah, it's pretty magical
around, isn't it?

49:57.195 --> 49:59.128
Hmm, yes, so you
didn't finish earlier.

49:59.130 --> 50:02.431
What brought you from
New York to Santa Fe?

50:02.433 --> 50:05.134
Well, I went searching
for new opportunity,

50:05.136 --> 50:07.603
and who was it that
said go west, young man?

50:07.605 --> 50:08.704
[laughing]

50:10.575 --> 50:13.009
[Spanish themed guitar music]

50:27.125 --> 50:28.257
Thank you.

50:36.434 --> 50:38.300
[foot stomping]

50:38.369 --> 50:40.169
[Joe] You're a dead man.

50:41.072 --> 50:44.774
I happen to know where
exactly you are.

50:44.776 --> 50:46.509
Can we switch places?

50:47.345 --> 50:49.412
-Oh, uh.
-It's just that it's

50:49.414 --> 50:51.514
not very gentlemanly of me to
not block you from the air,

50:51.516 --> 50:54.350
[stuttering], the draft from
the front door, the draft.

50:54.352 --> 50:56.485
Oh, it's okay, I don't
really feel a draft.

50:56.554 --> 50:58.387
Oh, no, there's definitely
a draft, absolutely.

50:58.456 --> 50:59.722
-Oh, okay.
-Yeah, yeah.

51:02.193 --> 51:05.227
Oh, it's really,
very thoughtful of you.

51:05.830 --> 51:08.230
It's me, thoughtful Pat.

51:10.535 --> 51:11.834
[blows out]

51:14.439 --> 51:15.738
It's very chilly
in here, isn't it?

51:16.407 --> 51:18.207
-I can't.
-[clears throat]

51:24.148 --> 51:25.414
Do you mind if I wear this?

51:27.151 --> 51:29.118
[light jolly music]

51:29.120 --> 51:31.520
Oh, do you want me to get
your coat from the hostess?

51:31.589 --> 51:33.489
No, no, no.
No, it's fine, it's fine.

51:33.491 --> 51:35.691
Your body heat actually
leaves from your head,

51:35.693 --> 51:39.361
so it's amazing how comfortable
a hat can make you feel, yeah.

51:40.198 --> 51:42.131
Marvelous feat of
engineering really.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.568
Okay, whatever you say.

51:55.446 --> 51:57.346
I, uh, I'm actually going
to go to the toilet, Emily,

51:57.348 --> 52:00.116
I've got cider all over
my hands, it's really sticky.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.686
Yeah, I'll order you
a drink while you're gone,

52:03.688 --> 52:05.721
you really seem like
you could use one.

52:05.723 --> 52:07.356
-Right, thanks.
-Yeah.

52:08.726 --> 52:10.493
[sighs]

52:10.495 --> 52:11.427
Okay.

52:17.602 --> 52:18.767
Jackass.

52:24.909 --> 52:26.342
[toilet flushing]

52:26.344 --> 52:28.210
[Seb] Oh, I feel like
something crawled

52:28.212 --> 52:29.578
-inside and died--
-Yeah, well you shouldn't
have put all that

52:29.580 --> 52:31.147
extra pepper sauce
on your chili.

52:31.149 --> 52:33.749
[Seb] Oh, it's like
I ate battery acid.

52:33.751 --> 52:36.418
Yeah, let me remind you,
you're the one who said you

52:36.420 --> 52:38.654
just had to eat something again.

52:39.790 --> 52:41.857
You should've listened to me,
you should've had what I had.

52:41.859 --> 52:43.659
[Seb] Oh, a yak burger?

52:43.661 --> 52:45.161
That's right.

52:45.163 --> 52:46.896
You know what you're
problem is, my friend?

52:46.898 --> 52:48.864
If you're going to
eat the way you eat,

52:48.866 --> 52:50.399
you got to expand your horizons.

52:50.401 --> 52:51.867
You got to, you got
to educate your palate,

52:51.869 --> 52:54.336
you got to eat more
international cuisine,

52:54.338 --> 52:55.604
you should've had
the yak burger.

52:55.606 --> 52:57.873
[Seb] But where yak's from?

52:57.875 --> 52:59.308
Well, they're from, uh--

52:59.310 --> 53:01.243
-Where?
-Over there.

53:01.245 --> 53:03.312
-Over where?
-Ah! Why does it matter
where they're from?

53:03.314 --> 53:05.681
Just finish your business,
will you? We got to get out
there and find this kid.

53:05.683 --> 53:07.850
-Come on.
-Good evening, sir.

53:09.487 --> 53:10.819
So glad I ran into you.

53:12.590 --> 53:14.623
Excuse me, do I know you, pal?

53:14.625 --> 53:15.891
Oh, I know you.

53:15.893 --> 53:18.194
Listen, I need a little help.

53:18.196 --> 53:19.595
I have a bet with
a friend out there about

53:19.664 --> 53:21.463
the lyrics to a Christmas carol.

53:21.866 --> 53:23.399
Help me out, will you?

53:23.401 --> 53:25.234
I came in here
to stall for time,

53:25.236 --> 53:27.403
I just, I can't
think of the words.

53:27.471 --> 53:29.238
-Yeah, I'm sorry, I don't
know any Christmas songs.
-[toilet flushing]

53:29.240 --> 53:31.540
Oh, come on.
Everyone knows Christmas songs.

53:31.542 --> 53:32.875
-We don't know any
Christmas songs,
-What's wrong with you, Jimmy?

53:32.877 --> 53:33.842
come on, we got
to get out there.

53:33.844 --> 53:35.311
Sorry, excuse me.

53:35.713 --> 53:37.479
Have you seen this guy?

53:38.883 --> 53:40.449
-Okay.
-Oh. [chuckles]

53:40.451 --> 53:41.517
Look at that.

53:42.687 --> 53:45.454
Matches my beguiling chapeau.

53:45.456 --> 53:46.755
[chuckles]

53:46.824 --> 53:48.357
Yes.

53:48.359 --> 53:49.792
Indeed, I have seen
the young lad.

53:49.860 --> 53:51.527
-Where?
-Where?

53:51.529 --> 53:54.263
Well, you help me, I help you.

53:54.732 --> 53:55.831
All right, all right.

53:55.833 --> 53:56.999
What song do you need to know?

53:57.268 --> 53:59.001
12 Days of Christmas.

54:00.271 --> 54:02.471
-Oh, that's a good one.
-12 Days of Christmas. Yeah.

54:03.007 --> 54:04.506
I know it but I don't--
do you know it?

54:04.508 --> 54:05.641
No.

54:05.643 --> 54:07.243

54:25.529 --> 54:28.731
So, aside from your willingness
to daunting cheerfully

54:28.733 --> 54:32.568
colored head gear, why are
you such a good Santa Claus?

54:33.437 --> 54:34.536
No, no, I mean it.

54:34.538 --> 54:35.971
Have you done this before?

54:35.973 --> 54:37.439
No, no, no, no, no.

54:37.441 --> 54:38.607
I have never done this, Emily.

54:39.677 --> 54:42.811
Um, to be completely
honest with you,

54:43.714 --> 54:46.315
when you put me on that
chair the first day,

54:46.317 --> 54:47.850
I was pretty terrified.

54:49.754 --> 54:51.353
It's not, "Gave".

54:51.355 --> 54:57.559
-[Seb] What?
-It's, "Sent", it's,
"My true love sent to me".

54:57.628 --> 54:59.428
-Is it?
-Uh-hmm.

54:59.430 --> 55:00.796
-Are you sure?
-Sent, gave.

55:00.798 --> 55:02.765
What's the difference?
Come on, what's next.

55:02.767 --> 55:05.801

55:15.780 --> 55:17.546
It's not shells, you bonehead.

55:17.548 --> 55:20.082
-Even I know that.
-What else does
a turtle have to give?

55:21.319 --> 55:23.352
I never experienced
the Santa as a child.

55:24.055 --> 55:26.488
We didn't have a mall
that he'd come to,

55:26.490 --> 55:29.391
I didn't have a chimney
that he could come down so,

55:29.393 --> 55:32.928
whenever he didn't come,
I just sort of gave up hope.

55:33.764 --> 55:35.764
It's turtle doves, you idiot.

55:35.766 --> 55:38.067
Even I know that, turtle doves.

55:38.069 --> 55:39.568
What's a turtle dove?

55:39.637 --> 55:41.437
Is that a turtle that flies?

55:41.505 --> 55:42.738
That would be
something, all right.

55:42.740 --> 55:45.474
-[laughing]
-Is it a dove with a shell?

55:45.476 --> 55:48.477
But when you put that
first that kid on my lap,

55:48.479 --> 55:50.713
I had this overwhelming
sense of, "I will

55:50.715 --> 55:52.448
not let these children down".

55:52.450 --> 55:53.382
I can't do it.

55:54.719 --> 55:57.019
You certainly have not
disappointed, Pat.

55:57.021 --> 55:58.420
[chuckles]

55:58.422 --> 56:03.759
Oh, Emily, if I can give these
kids happiness and hope

56:03.761 --> 56:06.762
that the Christmas spirit still
exists, it's still there.

56:07.365 --> 56:11.667
Then it's worth it. And to
be honest, they inspire me.

56:11.736 --> 56:14.136
It's a, it's a bird,
it's not a turtle, it's a bird.

56:14.138 --> 56:15.738
It's a type of bird,
it's a dove.

56:15.740 --> 56:17.005
-Are you sure?
-It doesn't have a shell,

56:17.007 --> 56:18.574
it has wings, it's a bird.

56:18.642 --> 56:19.775
Are you sure?

56:19.777 --> 56:22.511
You know where we are?
New Mexico.

56:22.513 --> 56:25.981
Government labs, they do special
things here, experiments,

56:25.983 --> 56:28.083
I've read about it online.

56:28.085 --> 56:32.054
They take a mouse head
and they put it on a fish.

56:32.123 --> 56:34.757
I got one word for you.

56:34.759 --> 56:36.091
-Cabbit.

-Yeah.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.010

complicated, guys.

56:55.079 --> 56:56.812

that you can just

write all this down for me?

56:58.949 --> 57:00.482
Yeah.

57:00.484 --> 57:03.051

except for away to college.

-No.
-Yeah.

-You're joking me.
-No, I'm not joking.

57:41.025 --> 57:43.025

-The FBI came

58:21.265 --> 58:23.565
with badges and everything.

58:23.567 --> 58:24.800
Whatever for, Mrs. O?

58:24.802 --> 58:27.603
Well, they say
they traced a phone call

58:27.605 --> 58:29.972
from here to a known criminal.

58:30.040 --> 58:32.040
Isn't that exciting?

58:32.042 --> 58:33.242
Don't you think so?

58:33.244 --> 58:38.280
-Yeah.
-Something about a big
money laundering ring.

58:38.549 --> 58:40.616
I, I, I don't really
know what that means,

58:40.618 --> 58:42.084

you'll be wanting though?

wanting from Santa?

A mom or
a fire truck. [chuckles]

Yes, Vin, I'll be very busy,

01:00:31.629 --> 01:00:34.096
so you better make sure you
come back tomorrow, okay?

01:00:34.098 --> 01:00:35.731
I will, Santa.

01:00:35.733 --> 01:00:37.065

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.254
[Patrick] There you are,
go on, Vin. Open it.

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:53.461
Oh, man, thank you, Santa.

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:56.064
-Oh, you're so welcome.
-Thank you, I love it.

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:58.300
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:03:58.302 --> 01:04:00.001
Excuse me, have you
seen this guy around?

01:04:00.938 --> 01:04:02.170
No, I don't think so.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:04.272
Are you sure? Have a look there.

01:04:04.274 --> 01:04:06.608
-No, I'm sure.
-Yeah, ah.

01:04:06.877 --> 01:04:09.344
What's all the hubbub about over
here? Ain't it a little late
in the game for these kids

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:12.080
to be giving Santa Claus
their wish list? I mean,
it's Christmas Eve

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:13.882
for crying out loud.

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:15.183
That doesn't matter.

01:04:15.185 --> 01:04:17.485
That's the singing Santa.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:20.322
-The kids just love him.
-Singing Santa?

01:04:20.324 --> 01:04:23.425
Uh-huh, I've taken my boys
three times to see him now.

01:04:23.427 --> 01:04:25.927
You know, he is actually
giving them presents?

01:04:25.929 --> 01:04:26.995
He is, is he?

01:04:26.997 --> 01:04:29.197
And he is so cute.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:31.867
I mean, he has
the cutest little accent.

01:04:31.869 --> 01:04:32.934
I don't know where
they found this guy.

01:04:32.936 --> 01:04:34.870
Accent, he's got an accent.

01:04:34.938 --> 01:04:36.071
This cute little
accent wouldn't happen

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.173
to be an Irish brogue, would it?

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:41.142
-Yes.
-Yeah.

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.544
-I guess so.
-Okay.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:44.079
-Thank you very much, ma'am.
-I couldn't quite place it

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.081
before, but. [chuckles]

01:04:46.149 --> 01:04:48.250

[Seb] My eye!

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.583
[Patrick] Bye, kids,
Santa's got to go.

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.351
Sorry, it's Christmas Eve.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:25.987
I'll get you, you
double-crossing little twerp.

01:05:25.989 --> 01:05:28.189
[Seb] My eyes, my eyes.

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:29.991
I'm blinded, I'm blinded.

01:05:29.993 --> 01:05:32.093
[Seb groaning]

01:05:32.095 --> 01:05:33.328
-I can't see.
-He's going around.

01:05:33.330 --> 01:05:35.497
He's going around, come on, Seb.

01:05:35.499 --> 01:05:37.933
-[Seb groaning]
-Hey, that's my hat!

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:42.437
[Seb groans] I can't see.

01:06:14.204 --> 01:06:16.271
Vincente, where are you going?

-Hey!
-Hey, wait!

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:24.773
Who do you think you are,
get, get, get, get, get!

01:07:24.775 --> 01:07:26.408
-Put it down now.
-That's our money.

01:07:26.410 --> 01:07:28.209
Put it down, you're a thief.

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.310
You're a thief, leave the money!

01:07:29.379 --> 01:07:31.413
[suspenseful festive music]

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.629
Now that's something
you don't see every day.

01:07:47.631 --> 01:07:49.297
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

01:07:49.299 --> 01:07:50.698
Santa's got a job to get done.

01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:52.333
[chuckling]

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:53.334
Good one.

01:07:54.404 --> 01:07:56.204
[bell dinging]

01:08:01.178 --> 01:08:02.544

Look, Santa's belly!

01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:44.786
What?

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.326
Okay, this way.

Man, it makes me really upset

what you're doing?

-Go away.
-Come on!

Pat, that was the FBI.

01:13:20.130 --> 01:13:21.729
What is going on?

01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:25.900
Emily, I'm so, so sorry.

01:13:25.969 --> 01:13:28.169
[panting] I started
working for this fella

-Why'd it stop?
-Oh, no.

01:14:35.572 --> 01:14:37.605
[Emily] What's wrong?

01:14:37.674 --> 01:14:40.174
Well, that's anticlimactic.

01:14:41.778 --> 01:14:44.178
What sort of fire
truck goes out of gas?

01:14:44.180 --> 01:14:45.580
It's an emergency vehicle.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:46.981
What happens if
we had an emergency.

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.650
Like, like, like, like
right now for example?

01:14:49.719 --> 01:14:52.720
Well, gosh, Pat.
I mean, [scoffs], this is
actually the old display truck

01:14:52.789 --> 01:14:55.590
the firefighters use to
collect toys for charity.

01:14:55.592 --> 01:14:56.891
You know, just for Christmas.

01:14:56.893 --> 01:14:59.660
Didn't it look a little
old-fashioned to you?

01:14:59.662 --> 01:15:01.262
Of course, it looked
old-fashioned, Emily.

01:15:01.531 --> 01:15:04.131
Everything in Santa Fe
is old fashioned, all right?

01:15:04.133 --> 01:15:06.968
Calm down, Pat,
we can figure this out.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.237
What's to figure out, Emily?

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.491
When I'll get deported?

01:15:13.492 --> 01:15:14.875
I mean, 'cause, you know what?
It's not if, it's when.

01:15:14.878 --> 01:15:16.711
Oh, actually, I know when.

01:15:16.713 --> 01:15:19.647
When I finish my jail sentence
in an American prison.

01:15:19.649 --> 01:15:20.848
And do you know what?

01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.984
Joe has like these
big long tentacles.

01:15:23.052 --> 01:15:25.152
And he's like octopus that like,
go through to the jail cell.

01:15:25.154 --> 01:15:26.854
He's like this big
Irish octopus.

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:28.956
I don't know.
He told me so himself.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:30.591

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:49.544
The top of my head all wet
and warm, I'm bleeding.

01:15:49.546 --> 01:15:52.613
-It's blood.
-[man] It's not blood.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:54.181
It's reindeer slobber.

01:15:55.151 --> 01:15:57.318
Dunder, stop eating his hair.

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:58.753
It's not good for you.

01:15:59.722 --> 01:16:01.255
I'm sorry about this.

01:16:01.257 --> 01:16:03.858
Every now and again
he nips at my beard

01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:05.860
when he's real hungry.

01:16:05.929 --> 01:16:07.128
Dunder?

01:16:07.130 --> 01:16:09.897
[man] Well, for you
native English speakers.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:11.766
It's Donner.

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:14.168
Dunder means thunder in Dutch.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:15.336
[reindeer belching]

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.637
See what I mean?

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.215
Sir, this is, uh,
this is great and all,

01:16:28.217 --> 01:16:29.951
but I have
the authorities chasing me.

01:16:29.953 --> 01:16:33.220
Please, it wouldn't be
Christmas if I didn't have

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:35.356
a few run-ins with the police.

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:38.793
I go down strangers'
chimneys for a living.

01:16:39.228 --> 01:16:43.598
Sometimes it's hard
for adults to believe.

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:44.665
They forget.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.870
-Hi, Emily.
-Hi.

01:16:50.907 --> 01:16:52.173
I don't understand this.

01:16:52.175 --> 01:16:54.742
Isn't it obvious,
I'm Santa Claus.

01:16:55.278 --> 01:16:57.244
You can call me Santa.

01:16:57.313 --> 01:16:59.246
-Santa?
-Santa Claus?

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:04.285
So if this is real,
why are you here?

01:17:04.854 --> 01:17:06.053
It's Christmas Eve.

01:17:06.122 --> 01:17:07.221
It's real, all right?

01:17:08.825 --> 01:17:10.391
Wait a second, I know you.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.862
I've been with you
all your life, Pat.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:17.398
I knew you were special
the day you were born.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:23.137
One of my elves, Alowishus,
he alerted me to your unusual

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:26.240
sense of caring,
your special gifts.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:30.745
Look, Pat, I want
to offer you a job.

01:17:31.214 --> 01:17:34.215
Well, an apprenticeship, really.

01:17:34.217 --> 01:17:35.750
An apprenticeship?

01:17:36.352 --> 01:17:41.989
-For what?
-I'll be 1,750 years
old next year.

01:17:42.725 --> 01:17:45.359
And my knees just aren't
what they used to be.

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.762
I could use a little help.

01:17:48.398 --> 01:17:52.667
I can't think of anyone
I'd rather have on my team.

01:17:52.735 --> 01:17:55.169
And Emily provided
the most excellent

01:17:55.238 --> 01:17:57.071
training ground for you.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:17:59.407
Thank you, Emily.

01:18:00.677 --> 01:18:02.343
[Emily giggles]

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:03.778
You're welcome.

01:18:05.815 --> 01:18:07.448
But why now?

01:18:07.450 --> 01:18:09.984
If you haven't hadn't had
gone through what you did,

01:18:09.986 --> 01:18:12.086
you wouldn't have
the same understanding

01:18:12.088 --> 01:18:13.854
of the children you do now.

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:17.725
Now, if you choose
to come work with me,

01:18:17.727 --> 01:18:20.227
you'll live with me
up in the North Pole.

01:18:20.997 --> 01:18:23.164
Let me be your family.

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:25.800
Let us be your family.

01:18:26.803 --> 01:18:28.869
Go, Pat. Go with Santa.

01:18:30.873 --> 01:18:32.306
What do you say?

01:18:33.876 --> 01:18:36.410
-Yes, yes, I'd love to.
-[uplifting music]

01:18:36.412 --> 01:18:39.313
[chuckles] I'm so glad, Pat.

01:18:40.717 --> 01:18:42.883
Now, we better get going.

01:18:42.885 --> 01:18:44.118
[both chuckling]

01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.453
Just, can I,
can I have a minute, Santa?

01:18:45.455 --> 01:18:46.420
Yeah.

01:18:49.092 --> 01:18:51.158
[sighs]

01:18:56.399 --> 01:18:57.932
Thank you, Emily.

01:19:01.437 --> 01:19:03.237
You did this for me.

01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:09.443
I always knew you'd
be my guardian angel.

01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:11.278
[chuckles]

01:19:13.983 --> 01:19:15.516
It's been grand.

01:19:15.518 --> 01:19:16.450
Yeah.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:18.919
[sighs]

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:22.490
Good luck.

01:19:22.492 --> 01:19:24.291
[sniffling]

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:36.370
It has been grand, hasn't it?

01:19:36.372 --> 01:19:37.538
[chuckles]

01:19:38.341 --> 01:19:39.273
Yeah.

01:19:41.978 --> 01:19:43.444
[sighing]

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:44.912
Merry Christmas, Pat.

01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:53.187
[Santa] Come on, Pat!

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:55.189
We have work to do.

01:19:55.191 --> 01:19:57.224
-[chiming]
-[Santa chuckling]

01:19:57.226 --> 01:20:01.495
You'll see each other again,
sooner than you think.

01:20:06.402 --> 01:20:08.302
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:20:10.573 --> 01:20:12.807
[light music]

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:14.942
Yeah, on Dasher!

01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:21.582
On Dancer, on Donner!

01:20:21.584 --> 01:20:25.052
-[laughing]
-Oh, you know the rest!

01:20:25.054 --> 01:20:27.054
Come on, everybody.
Let's go, yeah!

01:20:27.056 --> 01:20:29.990
[both laughing]

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.393
[Santa] Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
