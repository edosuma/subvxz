WEBVTT

00:01.660 --> 00:04.595
- HEY, GUS.

00:04.630 --> 00:07.190
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:07.240 --> 00:09.800
- JUST PLAYIN'...

00:09.840 --> 00:12.775
BOARD GRASS.

00:12.810 --> 00:16.075
- GUS, LET ME SEE
WHAT'S BEHIND YOUR BACK.

00:16.110 --> 00:17.543
- [sighs]

00:17.580 --> 00:19.775
- TAP SHOES?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:19.820 --> 00:22.038
- SHAWN, I LIKE TAP DANCING.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.819
IN FACT,
I'M PRETTY GOOD AT IT.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.579
WHEN PEOPLE PICK ON ME,
I JUST

00:25.620 --> 00:27.713
PULL OUT THAT TAP BOARD
AND SHOW 'EM WHO'S BAD.

00:27.760 --> 00:29.819
- DUDE, ALL YOUR PERMANENT
TEETH ARE IN, OKAY?

00:29.860 --> 00:32.397
YOU'RE PLAYING FOR KEEPS NOW.

00:32.430 --> 00:34.728
- YOU SHOULD TRY IT.
IT'S COOL.

00:34.760 --> 00:36.261
- [scoffs]

00:51.180 --> 00:54.445
[indistinct chatter]

00:56.150 --> 00:59.153
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAVE WE GOT?
- FEMALE VICTIM.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.818
LOOKS LIKE SHE WAS TRAPPED
INSIDE HER VEHICLE AND DROWNED.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.350
MUST HAVE BEEN HORRIBLE.

01:03.390 --> 01:05.119
- WHOA! O'HARA,
MAYBE I SHOULD HANDLE THIS ONE.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.821
YOU KNOW, UNTIL YOU GET
YOUR SEA LEGS BACK.

01:06.860 --> 01:08.589
- I AM FINE.
I WANT TO HELP.

01:08.630 --> 01:11.428
- OKAY. TAKE NOTES.

01:11.470 --> 01:13.358
TALL COFFEE, BLACK.
I'M OFF THE CREAM AND SUGAR.

01:13.400 --> 01:14.765
- CARLTON.
- I'M SORRY, O'HARA.

01:14.800 --> 01:15.835
I'M PULLING RANK
ON THIS ONE.

01:15.870 --> 01:17.735
THERE WILL BE PLENTY
OF OTHER FEMALES

01:17.770 --> 01:19.670
WHO DIE HORRIFIC DEATHS,

01:19.710 --> 01:21.769
AND YOU CAN INVESTIGATE
ALL OF THEM WHEN YOU'RE READY.

01:21.810 --> 01:25.143
GET YOURSELF SOMETHING TOO.

01:25.180 --> 01:26.772
I'LL GET THE NEXT ONE!

01:26.820 --> 01:29.118
HOPE SHE DOESN'T
REMEMBER THAT.

01:30.220 --> 01:31.881
LISTEN, MCNAB,
I'M STILL COVERING

01:31.920 --> 01:35.117
A BUTT-LOAD OF CASES I TOOK ON
WHILE O'HARA WAS ON VACATION.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.889
- SHE WAS ON STRESS LEAVE.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.557
- TOMATO, TOMAHTO.

01:38.590 --> 01:40.751
POINT IS, UNTIL SHE'S
READY FOR DUTY AGAIN,

01:40.800 --> 01:42.290
I NEED AN EXTRA SET
OF HANDS.

01:42.330 --> 01:43.866
SO PAD UP.
- COPY.

01:43.900 --> 01:45.527
- SPENCER--
KEEP YOUR PIE HOLE SHUT

01:45.570 --> 01:47.663
UNTIL I ASSESS
MY CRIME SCENE.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.861
- NOTHING SHUTS MY PIE HOLE
BUT PIE.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.479
- COME ON.

01:56.510 --> 01:58.341
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO THAT BODY

01:58.380 --> 01:59.813
TO GET A READING.

01:59.850 --> 02:01.875
- WHY DO YOU NEED TO GET
A READING OFF A SOGGY CORPSE?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.808
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
POINT AT IT FROM HERE?

02:03.850 --> 02:05.886
OR TOUCH THE CAR INSTEAD?

02:05.920 --> 02:07.911
WHY DON'T YOU GET A READING
OFF OF THAT BIRD OVER THERE?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.848
- ALL RIGHT, THIS VEHICLE
MATCHES THE DESCRIPTION

02:09.890 --> 02:12.723
OF THE ONE OUR MISSING PERSON
WAS LAST SEEN IN.

02:12.760 --> 02:14.193
- COPY.
- STOP SAYING COPY.

02:14.230 --> 02:16.425
- ROGER.

02:18.930 --> 02:22.229
- VICTIM IS IDENTIFIED AS...

02:22.270 --> 02:23.931
DESIREE BLAKE.

02:23.970 --> 02:26.302
RAINED LAST NIGHT, RIGHT?

02:26.340 --> 02:27.568
- YEP.

02:27.610 --> 02:29.908
- SHE TOOK THIS CURB
TOO FAST, LOST CONTROL,

02:29.950 --> 02:31.679
WENT DOWN THE EMBANKMENT,
DROWNED IN THE CAR.

02:31.710 --> 02:33.849
PUT TIME OF DEATH AS SOMETIME
YESTERDAY ON THE 12TH.

02:41.490 --> 02:45.278
- SHE WASN'T IN THE CAR ALONE.
WE'RE ON.

02:45.330 --> 02:48.390
LASSIE...
I'M AFRAID WE DON'T HAVE

02:48.430 --> 02:49.624
AN ACCIDENTAL DROWNING HERE.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.730
OUR DESIREE BLAKE
WAS MURDERED.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.795
- YOU ARE SO PREDICT ABLE,
SPENCER.

02:54.840 --> 02:55.864
- AS PREDICT ABLE
AS YOUR NEXT DATE

02:55.900 --> 02:57.561
ENDING WITH THE WORDS,

02:57.610 --> 03:01.535
"I HOPE THIS NEVER HAPPENS
TO SOMEONE ELSE"?

03:01.580 --> 03:02.877
- SPENCER,
STOP WASTING MY TIME.

03:02.910 --> 03:03.979
YOU KNOW HOW THIS WORKS.
YOU WANT IN.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.477
YOU MAKE YOUR CASE
TO YOUR FATHER

03:05.510 --> 03:06.716
WHO'S DONE NOTHING
BUT SAY NO TO YOU

03:06.750 --> 03:10.846
EVER SINCE HE WAS MADE HEAD
OF THE CONSULTANTS--THANK GOD.

03:10.890 --> 03:12.653
- I'D BE LYING IF I SAID

03:12.690 --> 03:14.851
I LIKE HAVING TO ASK MY DAD
FOR CASE ASSIGNMENTS.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.528
I'D ALSO BE LYING IF I SAID

03:16.560 --> 03:18.528
VAL KILMER STILL
LOOKS LIKE VAL KILMER.

03:18.560 --> 03:20.551
- I STILL HAVE HOPE.
- ME TOO.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.761
WE GO'I'I'A CONVINCE LASSIE
TO PUT US ON THIS CASE.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.791
- UH, YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.
I DON'T HAVE TIME.

03:24.830 --> 03:26.730
MY NEW TAP CLASS
STARTS IN HALF AN HOUR.

03:26.770 --> 03:29.967
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.
YOU'RE REALLY TAKING...TAP?

03:30.010 --> 03:31.762
THAT WASN'T JUST A BIT
WE WERE DOING?

03:31.810 --> 03:33.778
- DUDE, I'M DOING SOMETHING
FOR MYSELF,

03:33.810 --> 03:34.879
GETTING BACK TO THINGS
I LOVE.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.468
- FOR A BRIEF PERIOD
IN '93,

03:36.510 --> 03:38.808
I WAS KNOWN
AS DJ COLD CUTS.

03:38.850 --> 03:41.819
NOW, DO YOU SEE ME
DUSTING OFF MY TURNTABLES

03:41.850 --> 03:43.818
AND PLAYING THE CURVES
DOWNTOWN?

03:43.850 --> 03:45.647
- THE CURVES
BURNT DOWN LAST YEAR.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.453
- NO WONDER THEY WON'T
RETURN MY CALLS.

03:47.490 --> 03:50.789
- I'LL SEE YOU AFTER CLASS.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.957
- GUSTER.
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

03:53.000 --> 03:56.390
AM I TO UNDERSTAND
YOU'RE TAKING A...

03:56.430 --> 03:58.489
TAP CLASS?
- YES.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.736
- IS IT COU'N'OORDERED?

03:59.770 --> 04:01.590
- WILL IT MAKI\'IOYOU FASTER?

04:01.640 --> 04:03.904
- ARE YOU INVESTIGATING SOME
SORT OF DANCING DRUG RING?

04:03.940 --> 04:05.805
- NO.
- WELL, THEN, WHY ON EARTH

04:05.840 --> 04:07.899
WOULD A GROWN MAN
DO SUCH A THING?

04:07.940 --> 04:09.874
- LOOK, IT'S SOMETHING I'VE
BEEN DOING SINCE I WAS A CHILD,

04:09.910 --> 04:13.971
AND I DON'T CARE WHETHER
YOU OR SHAWN DON'T GET IT.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.480
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

04:31.930 --> 04:32.828
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY THAT
ONE MORE TIME.

04:32.870 --> 04:35.862
UH...SOME OF YOUR TIMING
WAS A LITTLE OFF.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.368
- [clears throat loudly]

04:38.410 --> 04:39.877
- NOT NECESSARY, MR. GUSTER.

04:39.910 --> 04:41.798
I CAN SEE EVERYONE
IN THE MIRROR.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.478
- OH.
- NICE MOVES, BY THE WAY.

04:43.510 --> 04:44.875
- OH. THANKS, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I BEEN TAPPING SINCE--

04:44.910 --> 04:47.845
- ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.883
- EXCUSE ME.
EXCUSE ME.

04:50.920 --> 04:51.944
HI.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.582
- OH, LET ME GUESS.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.917
THEY WANNA MOVE ME
TO THE ADVANCED CLASS?

04:54.960 --> 04:56.587
- [laughs]
NO. THERE'S A COWORKER

04:56.630 --> 04:58.951
WAITING FOR YOU IN THE HALL.
- WHAT?

04:58.990 --> 05:00.389
I'M SO SORRY ABOUT THIS.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.795
SHAWN--

05:01.830 --> 05:04.526
LASSITER.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

05:04.570 --> 05:06.788
I THOUGHT YOU WERE WORKING
ON YOUR DROWNING CASE.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.899
- I GOTTA WAIT FOR
THE SCIENCE MONKEYS IN FORENSICS

05:08.940 --> 05:11.966
TO ANALYZE THE EVIDENCE
FROM THE SCENE FIRST.

05:12.010 --> 05:13.739
SO...

05:13.780 --> 05:15.532
I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE WEIRD,

05:15.580 --> 05:18.708
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M HERE MYSELF BUT, UM...

05:18.750 --> 05:20.911
LONG STORY SHORT,
EVER SINCE THE DIVORCE,

05:20.950 --> 05:23.544
MY. . .THERAPIST

05:23.590 --> 05:25.581
HAS ADVISED ME TO STEP
OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE

05:25.620 --> 05:28.054
AND TRY NEW THINGS...
AND SINCE I DON'T LIKE BOOKS

05:28.090 --> 05:29.955
THAT AREN'T ABOUT
MILITARY STRATEGY

05:29.990 --> 05:31.218
NOR DO I CARE FOR
THE PLATONIC COMPANY OF WOMEN,

05:31.260 --> 05:33.820
I THOUGHT I'D SEE IF YOU CAN GET
ME INTO YOUR LITTLE CLASS HERE.

05:33.860 --> 05:35.657
IF YOU'RE DOING IT,
HOW HARD COULD IT BE, RIGHT?

05:35.700 --> 05:37.019
- YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE INSULTING ME

05:37.070 --> 05:38.822
AND ASKING ME FOR A FAVOR
AT THE SAME TIME.

05:38.870 --> 05:40.394
- GIVE ME A BREAK.

05:40.440 --> 05:42.431
MY INSURANCE ONLY COVERED
FOUR THERAPY SESSIONS.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.698
- LASSITER,
THE KIND OF TAP THAT I DO

05:43.740 --> 05:46.470
IS NOT SOMETHING YOU CAN JUST
JUMP INTO WITHOUT EXPERIENCE.

05:46.510 --> 05:47.909
- YEAH. YEAH. I'LL HAVE THEM
SEND OVER THE TRANSCRIPTS

05:47.940 --> 05:49.032
FROM WALKING
AND CHEWING GUM SCHOOL.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.502
CAN YOU GET ME IN THE CLASS
OR NOT?

05:50.550 --> 05:53.474
I DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME
BEFORE THE LAB CALLS.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.112
- I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.
- YOU'RE A PEACH.

05:55.150 --> 05:56.879
- ONE, TWO,

05:56.920 --> 05:58.740
A-ONE, TWO, THREE.

05:58.790 --> 06:01.816
[upbeat jazzy music]

06:01.860 --> 06:09.869
*

06:18.910 --> 06:20.673
- CRAMP! GOT A CRAMP!

06:20.710 --> 06:23.474
- UH, ALL RIGHT, HOLD ON.
UM...

06:23.510 --> 06:27.571
YOU WERE...

06:27.620 --> 06:29.815
IT'S A WRAP FOR TODAY,
EVERYONE.

06:29.850 --> 06:30.987
UH, GREAT WORK.

06:31.020 --> 06:33.989
REMEMBER...
KEEP IT IN THE POCKET.

06:34.020 --> 06:36.784
I'LL SEE YOU ALL NEXT TIME,
ALL RIGHT?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.751
- YEAH, GREAT.

06:37.790 --> 06:39.826
- ALL RIGHT.

06:39.860 --> 06:40.895
YOU OKAY?

06:40.930 --> 06:43.524
- [laughs] YEAH!
THIS IS...AWESOME.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.821
I'M FINE.
- I MEAN, DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

06:44.870 --> 06:46.963
EVERYONE HAS A HARD TIME
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.763
- IT WASN'T HARD.
IT WAS JUST A WASTE OF TIME.

06:48.800 --> 06:51.507
I JUST HOPE MY THERAPIST
DOESN'T MAKE ME COME BACK.

06:51.540 --> 06:53.428
- WAIT--YOU'RE QUITTING?
- NO, I'M NOT QUITTING.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.835
I'M SIMPLY CHOOSING
NOT TO CONTINUE.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.609
- LASSITER, I WANTED YOU
TO REALIZE HOW HARD IT WAS.

06:57.650 --> 06:59.447
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MAKE YOU QUIT.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.812
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
THAT PEOPLE WHO CARRY GUNS

07:01.850 --> 07:02.919
SHOULD DO WHAT
THEIR TH ERAPISTS SAY.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.544
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
LET'S TRY IT AGAIN.

07:05.590 --> 07:06.818
COME ON.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.088
- IT'S RIDICULOUS, GUSTER.

07:08.120 --> 07:09.826
- IT'LL BE SOMETHING SIMPLE.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.226
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TRY A CRAMP ROLL.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.989
READY?

07:16.900 --> 07:18.959
- THAT'S IT?
- THAT'S IT.

07:20.670 --> 07:21.898
JUST LIKE THAT.

07:21.940 --> 07:22.929
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

07:22.970 --> 07:27.873
[tapping rhythmically]

07:27.910 --> 07:29.775
- HEY...

07:29.810 --> 07:33.644
I THINK I'M ACTUALLY
STARTING TO GET IT.

07:33.680 --> 07:36.046
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
TO THIS PANSY STUFF AFTER ALL.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.082
- I DON'T KNOW IF PANSY'S
THE RIGHT WORD.

07:38.120 --> 07:39.883
- I KNOW, BUT THE ALTERNATIVE
SEEMED A LITTLE OFFENSE,

07:39.920 --> 07:42.059
SO I THOUGHT I'D WATER IT DOWN.

07:42.090 --> 07:44.126
I GOTTA TELL YA...

07:44.160 --> 07:47.049
I'M ACTUALLY STARTING
TO FEEL A LITTLE MORE RELAXED.

07:47.100 --> 07:48.897
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

07:48.930 --> 07:51.694
LET'S TRY A SHUFFLE.

07:51.730 --> 07:52.731
READY?
- UH-HUH.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.933
- JUST LIKE THAT!

08:01.310 --> 08:04.848
- YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE...
FOCUSING ON THE STEP,

08:04.880 --> 08:06.916
IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING ME
CLEAR MY MIND.

08:06.950 --> 08:08.178
- EXACTLY.

08:08.220 --> 08:11.041
- THIS IS THE CLEAREST
MY MIND'S BEEN IN YEARS.

08:11.090 --> 08:14.014
I ACTUALLY FEEL THE STRESS
JUST MELTING AWAY.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.812
- ALL RIGHT,
TRY THIS ONE NOW.

08:15.860 --> 08:17.680
READY?

08:22.030 --> 08:22.689
- YEAH.

08:22.730 --> 08:25.995
- OH?
- YEAH...ALL RIGHT!

08:26.030 --> 08:27.839
- SO WHAT ARE YOU
STRESSED ABOUT?

08:27.870 --> 08:29.838
- AH...WORK.

08:29.870 --> 08:32.168
THE NEIGHBOR'S SUING ME
FOR KILLING HIS SQUIRRELS.

08:32.210 --> 08:34.235
MOSTLY WORK.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.872
YOU KNOW THAT, UH,

08:35.910 --> 08:37.969
CASE YOU GUYS
WALKED IN ON EARLIER?

08:38.010 --> 08:39.716
- YEAH?

08:39.750 --> 08:41.547
- SOMETHING ABOUT IT
JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

08:41.580 --> 08:43.889
FOUND THIS BAG
OF UNMARKED PILLS IN HER PURSE.

08:43.920 --> 08:45.649
CRAP!
- WHAT?

08:45.690 --> 08:47.988
- WHILE I'M SITTING HERE
FOOLING AROUND WITH YOU,

08:48.020 --> 08:50.124
I FORGOT TO CALL THE LAB
ABOUT THE RESULTS.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.855
YEAH, IT'S LASSITER.

08:51.890 --> 08:53.596
DID YOU ANALYZE THAT SAMPLE
I BROUGHT IN YET?

08:53.630 --> 08:56.190
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE?

08:56.230 --> 08:57.197
OH, I DON'T KNOW,

08:57.230 --> 08:58.959
I THOUGHT MAYBE YOU COULD
TELL ME SOMETHING,

08:59.000 --> 09:01.139
LIKE WHAT THEY ARE,
WHERE SHE BOUGHT 'EM, ANYTHING.

09:01.170 --> 09:03.206
- THOSE PILLS WEREN'T BOUGHT.
THEY WERE MADE.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.730
- HUH?
- THEY'RE LAB TRIAL SAMPLES.

09:04.770 --> 09:05.907
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

09:05.940 --> 09:08.135
- I'M IN PHARMACEUTICAL
SALES, REMEMBER?

09:08.180 --> 09:10.102
- SINCE WHEN?
DOESN'T MATTER.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.299
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHO MADE THESE?

09:11.350 --> 09:12.772
- WELL, THERE'S ONLY
A HANDFUL OF LOCAL LABS

09:12.820 --> 09:14.879
THAT USE
THAT PENTAGONAL SHAPE.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.581
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

09:16.620 --> 09:20.056
- GUS, ARE YOU BUSY
RIGHT NOW?

09:20.090 --> 09:22.308
- GUS! THERE YOU ARE.

09:22.360 --> 09:23.918
YOUR CLASS LET OUT
JUST IN TIME.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.952
KFC IS GIVING AWAY
DOUBLE DOWNS.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.367
DUDE, THEY'RE JUST
GIVING THEM AWAY.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.994
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

09:33.040 --> 09:34.928
- I DISCOVERED, AFTER YOU TWO
LEFT THE CRIME SCENE,

09:34.970 --> 09:36.631
THAT I HAVE A NEED
FOR GUSTER'S...

09:36.670 --> 09:38.331
PHARMACEUTICAL EXPERTISE
ON THIS CASE,

09:38.370 --> 09:40.634
SO I CAME HERE TO FIND HIM.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.307
- YOU CONVINCED LASSIE
TO PUT US ON THE CASE.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.979
GOOD WORK, BUDDY!
- I SAID GUSTER'S EXPERTISE.

09:45.010 --> 09:47.615
NOT YOURS.
- YEAH, WE'RE A PACKAGE, LASSIE.

09:47.650 --> 09:48.969
YOU DON'T GET
JAKE "THE SNAKE" ROBERTS

09:49.020 --> 09:50.840
WITHOUT DAMIEN THE PYTHON.

09:50.890 --> 09:52.016
GUS DOESN'T WORK SOLO.
TELL HIM, GUS.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.654
- WELL, THAT'S NOT
ACTUALLY TRUE--

09:53.690 --> 09:56.011
- YOU HAVE OFFENDED HIM
BY MERELY SUGGESTING IT.

09:56.060 --> 09:57.288
DON'T BE ANGRY.
- I'M NOT.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.627
- OH, NO.
NOW HE'S INDIGNANT!

09:58.660 --> 09:59.922
YOU'D BETTER BACK OFF, JACK.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.894
GUS, WITHOUT BREATHING FIRE

10:01.930 --> 10:04.728
THROUGH YOUR SWEET, SWEET
NOSTRILS, TELL HIM TO BACK OFF.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.397
- I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THIS.
GUSTER, IF YOU DECIDE

10:06.430 --> 10:08.091
YOU WANNA
HELP ON THE CASE ALONE,

10:08.140 --> 10:09.334
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO COME WITH ME.

10:09.370 --> 10:12.908
- HA! WHY AREN'T
YOU LAUGHING?

10:12.940 --> 10:14.305
- I'D ONLY BE HELPING
WITH RESEARCH--IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.672
- NO BIG DEAL? YOU'D BE
WORKING A CASE WITHOUT ME.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.007
- YOU'VE WORKED TONS OF CASES
WITHOUT ME.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.075
- YEAH, BECAUSE I KNEW
I COULD SOLVE THEM.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.872
- ARE YOU SAYING I CAN'T
SOLVE A CASE WITHOUT YOU?

10:21.920 --> 10:23.342
- NO. I'M NOT SAYING THAT.

10:23.390 --> 10:25.813
- BECAUSE IF WE'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING OVER THESE FEW YEARS

10:25.850 --> 10:27.954
IT'S THAT YOU REALLY CAN'T
DO IT WITHOUT ME.

10:27.990 --> 10:29.855
- FIRST OF ALL...

10:29.890 --> 10:31.426
WE HAVEN'T LEARNED ANYTHING
OVER THE YEARS.

10:31.460 --> 10:33.257
SECOND OF ALL,
I'M THE ONE WITH THIS.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.029
- SO?
- SO, ALL YOU HAVE IS THIS--

10:35.060 --> 10:38.291
[gagging]

10:38.330 --> 10:40.992
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S ON.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.258
- IT'S NOT ON.
- IT IS ON, SHAWN.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.835
LIKE MASCARA ON PRINCE,
IT IS ON.

10:45.870 --> 10:48.236
LASSIE, COUNT ME IN.
IT'S ON.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.840
- I'M THRILLED. GET IN THE CAR.
- AND YOU KNOW WHO HAS SHOTGUN?

10:50.880 --> 10:51.847
- YOU.
- ME.

10:51.880 --> 10:53.711
- BECAUSE LASSIE'S
ALREADY BEHIND THE WHEEL.

10:53.750 --> 10:54.944
- BECAUSE IT'S ON.

10:54.980 --> 10:56.049
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

10:56.080 --> 10:58.241
IF THIS IS HOW YOU WANNA
PLAY IT, IT IS ON.

10:58.290 --> 11:01.009
- NO, NO. I DECIDE
WHEN IT SWITCHES FROM OFF TO ON.

11:01.060 --> 11:03.756
- SO IT'S OFF?
- YES.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.698
NOW IT'S ON!

11:15.740 --> 11:18.004
[tires squealing]

11:20.510 --> 11:23.968
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

11:24.010 --> 11:27.218
*

11:27.250 --> 11:30.947
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

11:30.990 --> 11:34.756
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

11:34.790 --> 11:36.382
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

11:36.420 --> 11:37.887
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

11:37.930 --> 11:42.355
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG *

11:42.400 --> 11:48.839
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL *

11:48.870 --> 11:50.861
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

11:50.910 --> 11:52.730
* THAT I'M NOT TELLING
THE TRUTH *

11:52.780 --> 11:53.974
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

11:54.010 --> 11:55.898
* THEY JUST DON'T
HAVE ANY PROOF *

11:55.940 --> 11:56.872
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

12:15.160 --> 12:16.491
- I'M DETECTIVE
CARLTON LASSITER.

12:16.530 --> 12:17.997
THIS IS MY ASSOCIATE
BURTON GUSTER.

12:18.030 --> 12:19.998
WHAT'S WRONG?

12:20.040 --> 12:22.964
- I'M NOT USED TO GETTING
INTRODUCED BY MY REAL NAME.

12:24.370 --> 12:27.339
- MA'AM, ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THESE PILLS?

12:27.380 --> 12:29.473
- YES.

12:29.510 --> 12:32.343
THOSE LOOK LIKE OUR TRIAL
H-C-G HORMONE PILLS.

12:32.380 --> 12:33.972
- A FERTILITY DRUG.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.942
- YOU ARE CORRECT.

12:35.980 --> 12:38.483
- VERY NICE, GUSTER.
- THANK YOU.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.159
- THEY'RE AN EXPERIMENTAL
FERTILITY TREATMENT

12:41.190 --> 12:43.454
CURRENTLY IN PHASE THREE
OF CLINICAL TRIALS.

12:43.490 --> 12:45.048
BUT THEY'RE NOT
FOR PUBLIC USE.

12:45.090 --> 12:46.557
- ANY IDEA HOW SOMEONE ELSE
COULD HAVE

12:46.590 --> 12:48.956
GOTTEN AHOLD OF THOSE?
- NOT A CLUE.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.820
- UNLESS THEY WERE
A TEST SUBJECT.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.963
- TRUE. BUT I RAN
THE TRIALS ALONE

12:53.000 --> 12:55.969
AND KEPT ALL OF THE TEST
SUBJECT LOGS TO MYSELF.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.160
- MA'AM, THOSE PILLS
WERE FOUND

12:57.210 --> 12:59.064
ON A DEAD WOMAN.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:59.110 --> 13:01.203
- SO WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE
THOSE LOGS IMMEDIATELY.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.947
- OF COURSE.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.310
- YOU SCARED THE CRAP
OUTTA HER!

13:07.350 --> 13:08.942
- [laughs] YEAH.
- BUT A PHASE THREE TRIAL

13:08.980 --> 13:10.311
IS A DOUBLE BLIND TRIAL,

13:10.350 --> 13:13.148
MEANING THERE HAS TO BE
AT LEAST TWO ADMINISTRATORS.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.078
THAT WAY,
THE TEST GROUP CAN HAVE

13:15.120 --> 13:16.189
A DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATOR
THAN THE PLACEBO GROUP.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.858
- SO YOU'RE SAYING SHE LIED?

13:17.890 --> 13:20.051
- THERE HAS TO BE
ANOTHER RESEARCH TECHNICIAN.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.318
- NICE INSIGHT, GUSTER.

13:22.360 --> 13:24.089
BUT WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY SOMETHING
WHEN SHE WAS STILL HERE?

13:24.130 --> 13:25.392
- YOU KNOW SHAWN.

13:25.430 --> 13:27.864
I USUALLY CAN'T GET
A WORD IN EDGEWISE.

13:27.900 --> 13:29.162
- OH, THAT'S FUNNY.

13:29.200 --> 13:30.861
O'HARA USUALLY JUST
BLURTS OUT HER OPINIONS.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.468
AS IF I ASKED FOR THEM.
OR WANTED THEM.

13:32.510 --> 13:34.273
OR NEEDED THEM.

13:34.310 --> 13:36.870
BECAUSE WOMEN RUIN EVERYTHING.

13:36.910 --> 13:39.049
- MAYBE NOW'S A GOOD TIME
TO CALL YOUR THERAPIST.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.116
- NO, LET'S CHECK OUT
THOSE LOGS FIRST.

13:41.150 --> 13:43.186
I'M GONNA SEE WHERE SHE WENT.

13:45.190 --> 13:48.887
- LOOK, GUS.
I'M GETTING HANDSY.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.456
- SHAWN...
- OH...

13:50.490 --> 13:53.152
HOW'S YOUR LITTLE MURDER
INVESTIGATION COMING ALONG?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.258
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
SHAWN?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.892
- YOU MISSING A MURDER WEAPON?

13:55.930 --> 13:57.158
YOU CAN TAKE THE KNIFE
OUT OF MY BACK.

13:57.200 --> 13:58.565
- HOW DID YOU FIND ME, SHAWN?

13:58.600 --> 14:01.194
- I INSTALLED GPS
PARENTAL CONTROLS ON YOUR PHONE.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.401
- IS THAT WHY
IT KEEPS BEEPING?

14:03.440 --> 14:05.067
- IT ALSO TELLS ME
IF YOU USE YOUR CREDIT CARD

14:05.110 --> 14:07.601
TO BUY CONDOMS,
LIQUOR, OR GLUE.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.278
IT'S A LITTLE WASTEFUL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

14:09.310 --> 14:11.039
- I'M A PLAYER, SHAWN.
- YOU'RE NOT A PLAYAH.

14:11.080 --> 14:11.899
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE,
SPENCER?

14:11.950 --> 14:14.077
WE ALREADY INTERVIEWED
THE TECHNICIAN.

14:14.120 --> 14:16.884
- IF GUS IS ALLOWED
TO SHOW OFF HIS EXPERTISE,

14:16.920 --> 14:18.182
THEN I'M ALLOWED
TO SHOW OFF MINE.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.949
- SPENCER, WE DON'T HAVE TIME

14:19.990 --> 14:22.083
TO WATCH YOU MAKE A SNOWMAN
OUT OF MASHED POTATOES.

14:22.120 --> 14:25.089
- THAT'S FUNNY.

14:28.560 --> 14:30.061
- I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

14:30.100 --> 14:31.897
THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE...

14:31.930 --> 14:33.067
SOMEONE EL--WRITING. ..

14:33.100 --> 14:34.897
WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND,
RIGHT-HANDED.

14:34.940 --> 14:37.033
- YES. SHE HAD A PARTNER.
WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.

14:37.070 --> 14:38.935
- YOU DO?
- YES. WE DO.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.938
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US.
GUSTER...

14:40.980 --> 14:43.369
- GOOD LUCK GETTING HIRED
ON A CASE THAT I'M ALREADY ON.

14:43.410 --> 14:46.072
- GOOD LUCK GETTING HIRED
ON MY CASE THAT YOU'RE NOT ON.

14:46.110 --> 14:49.989
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.011
LISTEN, DAD, I KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

14:52.050 --> 14:54.314
- YES. YOU CAN WORK ON THE CASE
WITH LASSITER AND GUS.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.112
- I HAD NO IDEA
YOU WERE GONNA SAY THAT.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.128
- EVEN THOUGH LASSITER
ONLY REQUESTED GUS,

14:58.160 --> 14:59.525
WE STILL HAVE TO PAY PSYCH
YOUR FULL RATE.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.027
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

15:01.060 --> 15:02.960
OF YOU SITTING AROUND
ON YOUR ASS ALL DAY

15:03.000 --> 15:04.092
COLLECTING A CHECK
FOR DOING NOTHING.

15:04.130 --> 15:06.121
SO I'M PUTTING YOU TO WORK.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.092
- SO EVEN WHEN YOU DO
SOMETHING I WANT,

15:08.140 --> 15:10.028
IT STILL COUNTS
AS SOME SORT OF PUNISHMENT?

15:10.070 --> 15:12.106
- YOU'RE WELCOME...NOW I NEED
TO FIND YOU A PARTNER.

15:12.140 --> 15:15.268
- OH! I'LL DO IT.
WHAT CASE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

15:15.310 --> 15:17.039
- THE ONE LASSIE'S
WORKING WITH GUS.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.149
- EVEN BETTER.
HE'S BEEN TREATING ME

15:18.180 --> 15:19.579
LIKE A ROOKIE
EVER SINCE I TOOK LEAVE.

15:19.610 --> 15:21.578
I AM ITCHING TO GET
BACK OUT INTO THE FIELD,

15:21.620 --> 15:24.316
EVEN IF IT MEANS
BABYSITTING SHAWN.

15:24.350 --> 15:27.114
- FINE. YOU TWO ARE WORKING
THE CASE TOGETHER.

15:27.160 --> 15:30.049
NO REASON FOR ANYTHING
TO FALL THROUGH THE CRACKS.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.094
- BABYSIT? REALLY, JULES?
COME ON.

15:35.130 --> 15:36.654
- SHAWN, WHAT HAVE YOU
DONE TODAY?

15:36.700 --> 15:38.964
- WELL, LET'S SEE.
I WATCHED SOME PHINEAS AND FERB.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.558
TOOK A NAP.
HAD A SNACK.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.636
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.
- EXACTLY.

15:42.670 --> 15:44.137
- I JUST WANNA BEAT
LASSIE AND GUS.

15:44.170 --> 15:46.104
- AND...CATCH THE KILLER.

15:46.140 --> 15:48.131
- SURE, YEAH,
IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.444
AS LONG AS WE GET TO DO
OUR THING, CHOP IT UP,

15:50.480 --> 15:53.142
POUND THE PAVEMENT,
WALK THE BZZZ-NEAT.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.171
- FIRST CATCH ME UP ON WHAT
WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE.

15:55.220 --> 15:57.711
- I REALLY AM EXHAUSTED.

15:57.750 --> 16:00.389
BUT...I'M HAVING A VISION
THAT THE LAB TECHNICIAN LIED

16:00.420 --> 16:02.354
ABOUT NOT HAVING
ANOTHER PARTNER.

16:02.390 --> 16:04.324
- WELL, THEN, LET'S CALL HER IN
AND SEE WHAT SHE'S HIDING.

16:04.360 --> 16:06.248
- WHAT!

16:06.290 --> 16:08.520
SORRY.
- OH.

16:11.530 --> 16:13.998
- HEY...WHAT ARE YOU TWO
DOING HERE?

16:14.040 --> 16:15.337
- WE'RE INTERVIEWING
A WITNESS.

16:15.370 --> 16:16.462
- WHAT ARE YOU TWO DOING HERE?

16:16.500 --> 16:17.706
- WE'RE INTERVIEWING A WITNESS.

16:17.740 --> 16:20.004
- ARE YOU TWO
WORKING TOGETHER NOW?

16:20.040 --> 16:22.008
WHAT HAPPENED, THEY BUST YOU
DOWN TO THE MINORS?

16:22.040 --> 16:24.645
- YOU GO WHERE
YOU'RE APPRECIATED.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.500
- I GOT TWO DIFFERENT CALLS

16:26.550 --> 16:28.177
ASKING ME TO COME IN
FOR QUESTIONING.

16:28.220 --> 16:29.642
- OH, REALLY, WHO CALLED YOU
FIRST, US OR THEM?

16:29.680 --> 16:31.545
- WHO'D YOU MEET FIRST,
US OR THEM?

16:31.590 --> 16:33.012
- WOULD YOU TWO STOP IT?

16:33.060 --> 16:35.051
MISS, WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE
YOU LIED TO US

16:35.090 --> 16:38.127
WHEN YOU TOLD US THAT YOU WORKED
ON A CLINICAL TRIAL ALONE.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.048
- WHICH, IF TRUE, COULD LAND
YOU AN OBSTRUCT ION CHARGE.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.499
- [whistles]

16:41.530 --> 16:44.021
- OKAY.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.367
OKAY, I'M SORRY.

16:45.400 --> 16:48.096
I WAS TRYING TO PROTECT
MY PARTNER BEN.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.233
Lassiter and Juliet:
PROTECT HIM FROM WHAT?

16:51.640 --> 16:54.074
- DESIREE WAS
BEN'S GIRLFRIEND.

16:54.110 --> 16:57.307
HE WAS SUPPLYING HER WITH
FERTILITY PILLS UNDER THE TABLE

16:57.350 --> 16:59.147
BECAUSE THEIR INSURANCE
WOULDN'T COVER

16:59.180 --> 17:00.613
THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
IN TREATMENTS.

17:00.650 --> 17:02.709
- WAIT. THEY WERE TRYING
TO HAVE A BABY?

17:02.750 --> 17:05.139
BUT THEY WEREU—iU-SEVEN MARRIED.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.215
GET WITH THE TIMES.
IT'S 2008!

17:07.260 --> 17:09.216
- IT'S 2010.
- HA. NICE TRY.

17:09.260 --> 17:11.728
THAT WOULD MEAN WE'RE AT WAR
WITH THE MACHINES.

17:11.760 --> 17:13.421
- HOW MUCH DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT THIS BEN?

17:13.460 --> 17:15.325
- BEN STEPHENS.

17:15.360 --> 17:19.569
HE'S NOT A LAWBREAKER.
HE'S A VERY DECENT GUY.

17:19.600 --> 17:22.137
HE WAS ONLY TRYING
TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

17:22.170 --> 17:24.104
I LIED TO KEEP HIM
OUT OF TROUBLE,

17:24.140 --> 17:25.539
BUT I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK
HE'S CAPABLE

17:25.570 --> 17:29.074
OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

17:29.110 --> 17:31.704
GUSTER, WOULD YOU CARE
TO GET A CUP OF COFFEE,

17:31.750 --> 17:33.069
MAYBE TAKE A LITTLE BREAK?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.144
- SURE THING.

17:34.180 --> 17:36.114
- YEAH. JULES...

17:36.150 --> 17:38.084
AREN'T WE DUE FOR A BREAK?

17:38.120 --> 17:40.680
HOW WOULD YOU FEEL ABOUT
A LITTLE, UH, HEAW PETTING?

17:40.720 --> 17:43.280
JUST A LITTLE OVER THE CLOTHES
THIRD BASE ACTION?

17:43.330 --> 17:44.820
- EEW!

17:44.860 --> 17:46.828
- SURE.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.067
[tires screech]

18:00.480 --> 18:02.277
- CARLTON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:02.310 --> 18:04.676
- ME? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU PINNED ME IN!

18:04.710 --> 18:07.110
- THIS IS MY AND GUSTER'S LEAD.
- NO, IT'S MY AND SHAWN'S LEAD.

18:07.150 --> 18:09.539
YOU SHOULD LEAVE.
- WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING?

18:09.580 --> 18:11.889
I AM HEAD DETECTIVE.
ALL LEADS GO THROUGH ME.

18:11.920 --> 18:12.841
- RIGHT. LIKE I HAVEN'T
HEARD THAT ONE BEFORE.

18:12.890 --> 18:14.482
I KNOW YOUR TRICKS.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.852
- O'HARA, I AM ORDERING YOU
TO GET BACK IN THAT VEHICLE

18:16.890 --> 18:18.255
AND DRIVE AWAY.

18:18.290 --> 18:20.224
- THAT'S GONNA BE TRICKY,
LASSIE.

18:20.260 --> 18:21.750
- GIVE ME THOSE!

18:21.800 --> 18:24.121
- OH, NICE SENIOR
OFFICIATING THERE, CARLTON.

18:24.170 --> 18:25.694
- SHUT IT!
- OOH.

18:25.730 --> 18:27.231
[crash]

18:31.810 --> 18:33.175
[tires screech]

18:33.210 --> 18:35.178
- YOU GUYS ARE LETTING
YOUR LEAD GET AWAY.

18:35.210 --> 18:38.646
- HA! YOU JUST LET YOUR LEAD
SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.454
- WILL SOMEONE EXPLAIN TO ME
HOW THE FOUR OF YOU

18:50.490 --> 18:51.525
LET HIM GET AWAY?

18:51.560 --> 18:53.391
SOMEONE ELSE.

18:53.430 --> 18:55.694
- WE WERE ABOUT
TO QUESTION THE SUSPECT

18:55.730 --> 18:57.869
WHEN WE GOT...SIDETRACKED
BY A DISAGREEMENT.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.527
- DISAGREEMENT.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.492
WELL, YOUR LITTLE DISAGREEMENT

19:01.540 --> 19:03.565
HAS LED TO A STATE-WIDE
MANHUNT.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.702
- HE LIKES TO USE
YOUR OWN WORDS AGAINST YOU.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.935
- LOOK, THIS REFLECT S POORLY
ON ME TOO,

19:06.970 --> 19:09.438
AND I'D LIKE TO KEEP MY JOB AT
LEAST TILL THE END OF THE MONTH.

19:09.480 --> 19:11.471
NOW, I WANT THE FOUR OF YOU
TO GET YOUR ACTS TOGETHER

19:11.510 --> 19:12.545
AND FIND HIM!

19:12.580 --> 19:15.811
- YOU CAN'T YELL AT ME.
YOU'RE JUST A CONSULTANT.

19:15.850 --> 19:19.308
- OH, YEAH? I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR NEIGHBOR'S SQUIRRELS.

19:19.350 --> 19:22.217
- CARRY ON.
GUSTER.

19:23.460 --> 19:24.256
[mouths word]

19:26.360 --> 19:28.453
- I TAKE MY JOB
VERY SERIOUSLY, GUSTER,

19:28.500 --> 19:30.468
AND I DON'T LIKE BEING
REPRIMANDED.

19:30.500 --> 19:31.819
ALL RIGHT,
WE'VE GOTTA FIGURE OUT

19:31.870 --> 19:33.531
WHERE BEN FLED TO.

19:33.570 --> 19:35.561
ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON
IS THAT HE WAS LAST SPOTTED

19:35.600 --> 19:37.431
HEADING WEST ON HIGHWAY 101.

19:37.470 --> 19:39.199
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.468
- IT HELPED YOU
CLEAR YOUR HEAD LAST TIME.

19:40.510 --> 19:41.534
- WHAT?
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.502
- JUST FOLLOW MY LEAD.

19:47.350 --> 19:49.773
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
WHEN WE WERE AT BEN'S HOUSE?

19:49.820 --> 19:51.685
- NO. IT ALL HAPPENED
TOO FAST.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.812
[rhythmically]
FIRST THING I KNOW,

19:52.850 --> 19:54.511
WE WERE ARGUING,

19:54.560 --> 19:57.552
NEXT THING I KNOW, HE WAS
CRASHING THROUGH THE GARAGE.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.524
WAIT! THE DMV REPORT
THAT CAME OUT TODAY--

19:59.560 --> 20:01.494
IT SAID THAT THE CAR
THAT DESIREE'S BODY WAS FOUND IN

20:01.530 --> 20:04.658
BELONGED TO BEN.
- RIGHT. THEY SHARED IT.

20:04.700 --> 20:07.339
THEY WERE LIVING IN SIN
AND DRIVING IN SIN.

20:07.370 --> 20:09.793
- SO WHOSE CAR DID BEN
CRASH THROUGH THE GARAGE IN?

20:09.840 --> 20:11.501
- GOOD QUESTION.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.434
MAYBE A LOANER?
- AH...

20:15.480 --> 20:17.971
NO. A RENTAL.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.649
WE SHOULD HAVE MCNAB CHECK
ALL THE LOCAL RENTAL COMPANIES.

20:20.680 --> 20:23.513
- NICE!
WHAT!

20:23.550 --> 20:24.983
- I GOTTA TELL YOU,

20:25.020 --> 20:26.942
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS STUFF
ACTUALLY WORKS!

20:26.990 --> 20:30.448
EVEN THOUGH I LOOK LIKE
A TOTAL MORON DOING IT.

20:31.760 --> 20:34.456
OH, CRAP.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.700
- LOOK AT THAT.
CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY.

20:44.740 --> 20:47.470
- SO THAT'S WHAT THE TWO OF YOU
HAVE BEEN DOING TOGETHER--

20:47.510 --> 20:48.579
TAP DANCING?

20:48.610 --> 20:50.601
- OKAY, THE TRUTH IS...

20:50.650 --> 20:53.278
LASSITER HAPPENS TO BE
IN MY TAP CLASS.

20:53.320 --> 20:56.312
- YOU'VE BEEN TAKING
TAP CLASSES TOGETHER!

20:56.350 --> 20:58.648
HOW SWEET! WHAT'S NEXT,
SINGING INTO HAIR BRUSHES?

20:58.690 --> 21:00.487
BEACHSIDE PILATES?

21:00.520 --> 21:03.956
QUICK, JULES, CHIME IN
WHILE I THINK OF MORE ZINGERS.

21:03.990 --> 21:05.719
- WHAT'S NEXT. . .BRIDGE?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.352
- YEAH, BRIDGE--
WHAT?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.595
THANKS FOR KILLING THE BIT.

21:09.630 --> 21:11.495
- TAP HAPPENS TO BE SOMETHING
WE BOTH ENJOY.

21:11.530 --> 21:14.533
- WHILE YOU TWO ARE SNEAKING
AROUND AND SPYING ON PEOPLE,

21:14.570 --> 21:15.935
both: WE HAVE A NEW LEAD.

21:15.970 --> 21:17.528
- YOU FINISHING EACH OTHER'S
SENTENCES NOW?

21:17.570 --> 21:18.901
BUT WE HAVE A LEAD TOO.

21:18.940 --> 21:20.669
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
OURS IS MORE OF A HUNCH--

21:20.710 --> 21:22.075
- HAMBURGER!

21:22.110 --> 21:23.805
- SHAWN, WHY IN THE WORLD

21:23.850 --> 21:25.670
WOULD I HAVE BEEN ABOUT
TO SAY HAMBURGER?

21:25.710 --> 21:28.816
- LET'S ROLL, GUSTER.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.818
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN
MAKE ANY SENSE.

21:30.850 --> 21:32.989
- I JUST HEARD YOU MAKE
AN "H" SOUND.

21:33.020 --> 21:34.749
- SO YOU GO TO HAMBURGER?

21:40.660 --> 21:42.594
SO WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
HOW BEN IS INVOLVED,

21:42.630 --> 21:44.495
BUT I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE GOING TO BE COOPERATIVE,

21:44.530 --> 21:46.361
SEEING THAT
WE DON'T HAVE A WARRANT.

21:46.400 --> 21:48.368
- JULES, DON'T BE CANADA.
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

21:48.400 --> 21:51.107
- HELLO.
- HELLO. HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

21:51.140 --> 21:53.404
- I WOULD LIKE TO SELL
MY BODY TO SCIENCE.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.476
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO MAKE
THE FIRST BID.

21:55.510 --> 21:57.671
- IS THIS A...SILENT AUCTION?

21:57.710 --> 21:59.940
WHAT? SHE STARTED IT.

21:59.980 --> 22:02.778
OH, UH, ACTUALLY, WE...
WOULD LIKE TO SIGN UP

22:02.820 --> 22:05.516
TO BE HUMAN GUINEA PIGS--
FOR MONEY.

22:05.550 --> 22:07.040
- OUR CURRENT VOLUNTEER
STUDY ONLY PAYS 20 BUCKS.

22:07.090 --> 22:09.718
- I'LL DO IT.
- UH, SORRY. WOMEN ONLY.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.557
- SHE'LL DO IT.
- WHAT?

22:11.590 --> 22:12.887
- DON'T ACT LIKE
YOU CAN'T USE 20 BUCKS.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.124
I'VE SEEN YOUR PLACE.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.627
- WELL, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

22:15.660 --> 22:17.423
YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN
THE CONSENT FORMS.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.426
YOU'LL BE PUT UNDER ANESTHESIA,
AND THERE'S A CHANCE

22:19.470 --> 22:21.563
THE HORMONES
MAY MAKE YOUR FEET GROW.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.603
- SHE'S INTERESTED.

22:24.640 --> 22:26.699
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT IS ANYONE DOING?

22:26.740 --> 22:28.537
IN THE GRAND SCHEME OF THINGS?
- STOP.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.775
- YOUR NEGATIVITY IS...

22:30.810 --> 22:32.448
IS CLOGGING UP
MY PSYCHIC SIGNALS.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.539
DO YOU MIND KEEPING HER BUSY

22:34.580 --> 22:35.877
WHILE I ATTEMPT
TO UNCLOG THEM?

22:35.920 --> 22:37.945
- AND HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO THAT?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.912
- GUS WOULD TURN INTO SMOOTH
GUS AND TRY TO PICK HER UP.

22:39.950 --> 22:43.078
- I AM NOT HITTING ON A GIRL.
- WHY, DOES THAT SCARE YOU?

22:43.120 --> 22:45.122
OR DOES THAT NOT SCARE YOU?
AND DOES THAT SCARE YOU?

22:45.160 --> 22:46.582
- SHAWN...
- WHAT?

22:46.630 --> 22:48.495
- FOR YOU KNOW,
THIS GIRL COULD BE DANGEROUS.

22:48.530 --> 22:49.827
- YOU'D BETTER MAKE SURE OF THAT

22:49.860 --> 22:51.521
BEFORE YOU ENTER INTO
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

22:51.570 --> 22:53.458
'CAUSE SHE PROBABLY
WON'T CHANGE.

22:53.500 --> 22:56.037
- RIGHT THIS WAY.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.539
[quietly] I'LL BE BACK
TO GET YOUR INFORMATION.

22:59.570 --> 23:01.629
- I'LL BE RIGHT HERE.

23:32.870 --> 23:34.804
- ALL RIGHT, PUT THE TIME OF
DEATH DOWN SOMETIME YESTERDAY

23:34.840 --> 23:36.034
ON THE 12TH.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.609
- SO, SHAWN...
- HEY.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.686
- I TURNS OUT I AM TAKING
ALL OF THE MEDICATIONS

23:50.730 --> 23:52.550
THAT TONYA HERE
SAYS DISQUALIFIES SOMEBODY

23:52.590 --> 23:54.194
FROM BEING
A PART OF THE STUDY.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.595
- THAT'S--NO.

23:55.630 --> 23:57.461
A BUMMER.

23:57.500 --> 23:58.694
OH, WELL.
WE TRIED.

23:58.730 --> 24:00.698
I GUESS WE MT’IOULD ROLL?

24:00.740 --> 24:02.594
- AND IF THEY EVER
DISCOVER A DRUG HERE

24:02.640 --> 24:04.608
THAT MAKES ME AS STRONG
AS AN OX--

24:04.640 --> 24:06.232
BUT ONLY WHEN
I'M FIGHTING ANOTHER OX--

24:06.270 --> 24:07.635
YOU LET ME KNOW.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.568
- I WILL.
- ALL RIGHT.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.511
- WE ARE GONNA NAIL
THIS GUY, GUSTER.

24:17.550 --> 24:19.188
- ARE YOU SURE
BEN'S GUILTY?

24:19.220 --> 24:21.780
- 100%.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.152
- OKAY, HERE'S THE, UH,
RENTAL AGREEMENT.

24:24.190 --> 24:25.487
MR. STEPHENS' CAR
WAS DUE BACK YESTERDAY,

24:25.530 --> 24:27.259
AND WE HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM HIM.

24:27.290 --> 24:28.598
D-DO YOU THINK HE STOLE IT?

24:28.630 --> 24:29.654
- I'D SAY YOUR CHANCES

24:29.700 --> 24:30.962
OF SEEING THAT VEHICLE AGAIN

24:31.000 --> 24:32.262
ARE ABOUT AS GOOD
AS YOUR CHANCES

24:32.300 --> 24:35.269
OF TURNING THIS JOB
INTO A VIABLE CAREER.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.268
HEY, THIS ANTITHEFT
TRACKING DEVICE.

24:37.300 --> 24:38.506
THAT A LOJACK?

24:38.540 --> 24:40.633
- YEAH.

24:40.680 --> 24:42.705
- WE'RE GONNA NEED
THAT TRACKING I.D.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.003
WE'VE GOT CLEAR MOTIVE,
ALL RIGHT?

24:46.050 --> 24:47.642
THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER
FOR A WHILE.

24:47.680 --> 24:49.045
SHE'S BEEN PRESSURING HIM,

24:49.080 --> 24:50.513
PUTTING THE SQUEEZE ON HIM
TO HAVE KIDS.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.040
THEY'RE COMMON LAW
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

24:52.090 --> 24:53.580
SHE'D GET HALF OF EVERYTHING
IF HE LEFT HER.

24:53.620 --> 24:54.951
THAT'S NOT AN OPTION,
SO HE KILLED HER.

24:54.990 --> 24:56.617
- I DON'T KNOW, LASSITER.

24:56.660 --> 24:57.888
WHO HELPS HIS GIRLFRIEND
OBTAIN FERTILITY PILLS

24:57.930 --> 24:59.557
IF HE'S NOT PLANNING
ON BEING WITH HER?

24:59.590 --> 25:00.659
THIS DOESN'T FEEL LIKE
MURDER.

25:00.700 --> 25:02.019
- GUSTER,
YOU'VE GOTTA GROW UP.

25:02.060 --> 25:04.563
PEOPLE HAVE SEX,
AND THEY KILL EACH OTHER--

25:04.600 --> 25:05.669
THAT'S THE REAL WORLD.

25:05.700 --> 25:07.190
NOT SOME MAGICAL FEELINGS
PLACE.

25:07.230 --> 25:09.698
- HERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.662
LET'S GO GET A WARRANT.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.575
- WE'RE GONNA EAT FIRST, RIGHT?
- YEAH, WE'LL EAT ON THE WAY.

25:13.610 --> 25:15.828
I GOT AN ASHTRAY
FULL OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.041
- WE'RE SO SORRY
FOR YOUR LOSS, MISS BLAKE.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.241
NOW, THIS MUST BE
VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU,

25:20.280 --> 25:22.271
SO WE WON'T TAKE UP
A LOT OF YOUR TIME.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.912
- I WISH I COULD BE
OF MORE HELP,

25:23.950 --> 25:25.542
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHERE
BEN IS.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.182
BELIEVE ME, IF I KNEW,
I WOULD TELL YOU.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.950
- WAS THERE ANIMOSITY
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU?

25:29.990 --> 25:31.548
- HE WAS A CHEATING BASTARD.

25:31.590 --> 25:33.126
DESIREE FOUND OUT,

25:33.160 --> 25:36.652
AND THEY HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT
RIGHT BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

25:36.700 --> 25:39.567
- I WONDER WHAT SHE DID
TO MAKE HIM CHEAT.

25:39.600 --> 25:40.567
- SHAWN.
- WHAT?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.261
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:42.300 --> 25:45.269
- YOU WILL THANK ME LATER.

25:45.310 --> 25:47.778
MRS. BLAKE...

25:47.810 --> 25:52.099
I'M SENSING THAT BEN FELT
GREAT REMORSE FOR HIS ACTIONS,

25:52.150 --> 25:53.947
TRIED TO REACH OUT
TO YOU PERSONALLY.

25:53.980 --> 25:55.675
- YOU MEAN THE FLOWERS
HE KEPT SENDING?

25:55.720 --> 25:57.984
AS ALWAYS, TOO LITTLE TOO LATE.
I NEVER TRUSTED THAT MAN.

25:58.020 --> 25:59.317
- WHEN DID YOU LAST SEE BEN?

25:59.350 --> 26:02.114
- RIGHT AFTER
THEY FOUND DESIREE'S BODY.

26:02.160 --> 26:04.355
HE CAME BY
TO OFFER CONDOLENCES.

26:04.390 --> 26:06.950
I...PROMPTLY KICKED HIM OUT.

26:06.990 --> 26:09.857
I'M NOT SO SURE HE'S NOT
THE REASON SHE'S DEAD.

26:09.900 --> 26:14.690
- WELL...WE HAVE TAKEN UP
ENOUGH OF YOUR TIME, MISS BLAKE.

26:14.740 --> 26:17.300
THANK YOU.
- WE'RE JUST GONNA--

26:19.010 --> 26:20.034
- SHAWN!

26:20.070 --> 26:22.300
- LET'S GO.

26:22.340 --> 26:23.944
- BEN'S LOOKING
MORE AND MORE GUILTY

26:23.980 --> 26:25.641
THE MORE WE LEARN ABOUT HIM.

26:25.680 --> 26:26.977
- I DON'T KNOW, JULES.

26:27.010 --> 26:29.069
WHAT KIND OF PERSON
KILLS SOMEONE'S DAUGHTER

26:29.120 --> 26:30.849
AND THEN SENDS HER FLOWERS
THE NEXT DAY?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.118
- A CRAFTY KILLER--
THAT'S WHO.

26:32.150 --> 26:33.856
WE NEED TO GO BACK
TO THE STATION

26:33.890 --> 26:35.687
AND START PUTTING
THESE PIECES TOGETHER.

26:35.720 --> 26:37.688
- BACK TO THE STATION? CAN'T WE
DO THIS OVER A JAMBA JUICE?

26:37.730 --> 26:40.028
- MY GRAPH PAPER AND COLORED
PENCILS ARE AT THE STATION

26:40.060 --> 26:41.823
SO THAT WE CAN CHART
WHAT WE KNOW

26:41.860 --> 26:43.157
AND EXT RAPOLATE WHAT WE DON'T.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.360
- WHAT WAS THAT WORD?
- EXT RAPOLATE.

26:44.400 --> 26:46.095
- THAT DOESN'T SOUND
VERY FUN AT ALL.

26:46.130 --> 26:47.859
- WHOEVER SAID WORK
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.891
- RON JEREMY, FOR STARTERS.

26:49.940 --> 26:51.931
TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU GO BACK TO THE OFFICE

26:51.970 --> 26:53.232
AND PUT ALL THAT BORING
STUFF TOGETHER

26:53.270 --> 26:55.033
THAT...I ALREADY
FORGOT WHAT IT WAS,

26:55.080 --> 26:56.775
AND I'LL SEE YOU THERE
IN HALF AN HOUR.

26:56.810 --> 26:58.368
- OKAY.
HALF AN HOUR.

26:58.410 --> 26:59.775
- SWEET.

27:08.690 --> 27:11.727
- GOOD WORK, GUS.
YOU FOUND BEN.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.194
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

27:14.230 --> 27:16.027
DUDE, I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT PSYCHIC.

27:16.060 --> 27:19.223
- SORRY, BUDDY. IT'S HARD
TO KEEP TRACK OF WHO KNOWS WHAT.

27:19.270 --> 27:20.362
I BROKE AWAY FROM JULIET,

27:20.400 --> 27:22.368
TRACKED YOU
ON YOUR LITTLE THINGY.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.061
HOW'D YOU FIND HIM?

27:24.110 --> 27:26.328
- LASSITER USED THE LOJACK
TRACKING SYSTEM ON HIS CAR.

27:26.370 --> 27:28.076
I SAW THE LOCATION,

27:28.110 --> 27:29.907
SNUCK AWAY WHILE LASSITER
WAS WORKING ON THE WARRANT.

27:29.940 --> 27:33.171
- FIGURED YOU GUYS WERE CLOSE.
AND LIKE ME, YOU BROKE AWAY...

27:33.210 --> 27:35.019
BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT
BEN WAS INNOCENT.

27:35.050 --> 27:36.244
- DUDE, YOU'RE DOING IT
AGAIN.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.180
- AM I?
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

27:38.220 --> 27:39.687
- IS THAT WHY YOU BROKE AWAY
FROM JULIET?

27:39.720 --> 27:43.053
- YEP. NEEDED TO CHECK IT OUT
FOR MYSELF.

27:43.090 --> 27:45.183
- HMM.
WELL...

27:45.230 --> 27:47.698
SINCE WE'RE BOTH HERE,
WE MIGHT AS WELL DO IT TOGETHER.

27:47.730 --> 27:49.220
- SURE. WHATEVER.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.177
- BEN.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.708
NO, WAIT, NO!

28:04.880 --> 28:06.768
BEN, WE DON'T--
WAIT!

28:11.490 --> 28:13.754
- WHATEVER THE POLICE
THINK I DID,

28:13.790 --> 28:15.417
I DIDN'T DO IT.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.984
- I'M A PSYCHIC
WITH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.853
THIS IS MY PARTNER,
SANTONIO HOLMES.

28:19.890 --> 28:21.050
WE DON'T THINK
YOU DID IT EITHER.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.124
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

28:22.160 --> 28:23.798
YOU WERE MORE DISTRAUGHT
THAN ANYONE

28:23.830 --> 28:26.492
TO HEAR THAT DESIREE WAS DEAD.
- OF COURSE I WAS.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.896
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT
MAKES ME SICK.

28:28.940 --> 28:31.329
- I WANT TO FIND THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING.

28:31.370 --> 28:33.429
I'VE LOVED DESIREE LIKE...
FOREVER.

28:33.470 --> 28:36.075
WE'D BEEN LIVING TOGETHER
SINCE WE GRADUATED.

28:36.110 --> 28:38.772
- WHEN DID YOU GRADUATE?
- 2005.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.412
- LASSITER'S THEORY
THAT HE KILLED DESIREE

28:42.450 --> 28:44.486
TO PROTECT HIS MONEY
DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

28:44.520 --> 28:47.387
THEY WEREN'T COMMON LAW
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

28:50.790 --> 28:52.326
THOSE RIGHTS DON'T KICK IN

28:52.360 --> 28:54.328
UNTIL A COUPLE HAS BEEN
TOGETHER FOR SEVEN YEARS.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.395
- AND THEY MOVED IN TOGETHER
IN 2005,

28:55.430 --> 28:57.318
WHICH WAS ONLY
TH REE YEARS AGO.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.021
- FIVE.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.436
- I SHOULD START CARRYING
A POCKET CALENDAR.

29:01.470 --> 29:03.097
- BEN, WHY DID YOU RUN
FROM THE COPS?

29:03.140 --> 29:05.506
- DESIREE'S MOM,
SHE PRACTICALLY ACCUSED ME

29:05.540 --> 29:07.508
OF CAUSING DESIREE'S DEATH.

29:07.540 --> 29:09.371
I THOUGHT SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO CALLED THE COPS ON ME,

29:09.410 --> 29:10.968
SO...I PANICKED.

29:11.010 --> 29:12.477
- BEN, LISTEN TO ME.

29:12.510 --> 29:14.239
BUT ALSO HEAR ME.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.545
YOU DIDN'T DO YOURSELF
ANY FAVORS BY HIDING, OKAY?

29:17.580 --> 29:20.083
I CAN CONVINCE THE COPS
THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT,

29:20.120 --> 29:22.008
BUT ONLY IF YOU TRUST US.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.051
- AND YOU'RE SURE--
- I'LL DO THE TOUCHING.

29:24.090 --> 29:26.183
- YOU'RE SURE
THEY'LL BELIEVE I'M INNOCENT.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.391
- I CAN GUARANTEE IT.

29:28.430 --> 29:30.751
- FREEZE,
YOU MURDEROUS DIRT BAG!

29:33.230 --> 29:34.197
- ISH.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.538
I CAN GUARANTEE IT "ISH."

29:41.980 --> 29:43.504
- GUYS, PLEASE HELP ME OUT
HERE.

29:43.540 --> 29:46.145
- HANG IN THERE, BEN.
- SHAWN...SANTONIO?

29:46.180 --> 29:48.011
CAN I AT LEAST
GET MY PHONE CALL?

29:48.050 --> 29:49.813
- ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT IF IT
WASN'T A COMMON LAW MARRIAGE?

29:49.850 --> 29:51.818
IF HE WAS INNOCENT, HE WOULDN'T
HAVE RUN FROM THE POLICE.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.852
- I HAVE A VERY STRONG HUNCH
THAT HE'S NOT OUR KILLER.

29:53.890 --> 29:56.256
- WE DON'T DEAL IN HUNCHES.
_ "WE"?

29:56.290 --> 30:00.283
- I'M SORRY, SHAWN,
BUT IT'S OVER.

30:00.330 --> 30:02.457
- I UNDERSTAND.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.923
IT WAS FUN WHILE IT LASTED.
- NO, IT WASN'T.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.926
- WE MADE A GREAT TEAM.
- NO, WE DIDN'T.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.267
IT WAS A DISASTER!

30:08.300 --> 30:10.188
PARTNERS DON'T LIE
TO ONE ANOTHER,

30:10.240 --> 30:12.367
AND PARTNERS DON'T RUN OFF
MID-INVESTIGATION,

30:12.410 --> 30:14.503
AND PARTNERS DO NOT
GO THROUGH MY PURSE,

30:14.540 --> 30:16.428
FIND MY PHONE,
AND TEXT PHOTOS OF MY DOG

30:16.480 --> 30:18.345
TO EVERY GUY
IN MY ADDRESS BOOK

30:18.380 --> 30:19.972
WITH THE CAPTION,
"THIS IS YOU."

30:20.010 --> 30:21.511
- PARTNERS SUPPORT
EACH OTHER'S THEORIES.

30:21.550 --> 30:22.869
- WE NEVER SUPPORT EACH OTHER.

30:22.920 --> 30:24.444
- YEAH. WE'RE CONSTANTLY
LYING.

30:24.490 --> 30:25.616
AND RUNNING.

30:25.650 --> 30:28.255
I MISS THAT.
- ME TOO. WHAT!

30:28.290 --> 30:30.611
- WE'RE STILL HIRED
ON THIS CASE, GUS.

30:30.660 --> 30:32.252
LET'S GET TO WORK.

30:32.290 --> 30:33.894
- BUT FIRST CAN WE GET
SOMETHING TO EAT?

30:33.930 --> 30:35.420
I'M KIND OF HUNGRY.
ALL I'VE HAD ALL DAY

30:35.460 --> 30:37.519
ARE SUNFLOWER SEEDS.
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

30:37.560 --> 30:39.369
I HAVEN'T EATEN
IN ALMOST TWO HOURS.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.038
both: HAMBURGERS!

30:41.070 --> 30:42.435
- AND THEN WE TRY TO FREE BEN.

30:42.470 --> 30:45.268
- AND THEN...JAPA DOGS.

30:45.310 --> 30:47.369
- [quietly] WHAT!

30:47.410 --> 30:50.379
- WELL, ONE THING'S FOR SURE
FROM ALL THIS.

30:50.410 --> 30:52.207
IT'S NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.571
- THANKS. I'M SORRY YOU GOT
STUCK WITH AN EXTRA CASELOAD

30:54.620 --> 30:55.575
WHILE I WAS GONE.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.019
- THAT'S OKAY.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.518
BESIDES, IT'S YOUR EXTRA
CASELOAD NOW.

30:59.550 --> 31:01.950
- IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.424
- WOODROW, MY GOOD MAN.
- SHAWN!

31:04.460 --> 31:06.883
ALWAYS NICE TO SEE YOU
WALK THROUGH THAT DOOR.

31:06.930 --> 31:09.649
- WELL, LET'S HOPE YOU NEVER
SEE ME ROLLED IN ON A GURNEY.

31:09.700 --> 31:11.019
- LET'S.
ALTHOUGH I'D BE HONORED

31:11.070 --> 31:12.469
TO SAW THROUGH YOUR CHEST

31:12.500 --> 31:14.229
AND REMOVE YOUR GOOD-NATURED
HEART FROM ITS CAVITY.

31:14.270 --> 31:15.897
- I'M TOUCH ED.

31:15.940 --> 31:17.999
WOODY, IN YOUR PROFESSIONAL
OPINION, HOW DO I DIE?

31:18.040 --> 31:20.008
- MURDER.
GANGLAND-STYLE EXECUTION.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.076
WE NEVER FIND YOUR HEAD.
- THAT'S A SHAME.

31:22.110 --> 31:24.408
- YOU SLIP IN A TUB.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.145
- WE NEED YOU TO TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU CAN

31:26.180 --> 31:29.047
ABOUT, UH, THE DEATH OF THIS
HERE DESIREE BLAKE.

31:29.080 --> 31:30.638
- CAUSE OF DEATH
IN OUR VICTIM...

31:30.680 --> 31:33.444
- OH.
- IS CONFIRMED TO BE DROWNING

31:33.490 --> 31:36.288
EVIDENCED BY THE PRESENCE
OF FLUID IN THE LUNGS.

31:36.320 --> 31:37.617
- YEAH, AND WHAT ABOUT THIS MARK
ON HER ANKLE THERE?

31:37.660 --> 31:40.379
- YEAH.
INTERESTING, ISN'T IT?

31:40.430 --> 31:42.990
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE FREEZER BURN.
- FREEZER BURN?

31:43.030 --> 31:45.498
HOW WOULD SHE GET FREEZER BURN
IN 70-DEGREE WATER?

31:45.530 --> 31:47.259
- BETTER QUESTION IS
WHY WOULD A DROWNING VICTIM

31:47.300 --> 31:49.291
SHOW NO SIGNS OF STRUGGLE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

31:49.340 --> 31:51.365
- WELL, THERE'S NO BRUISING
ON THE BODY

31:51.410 --> 31:54.629
OR--OR CUTS
OR ANY KIND OF STRUGGLE.

31:57.140 --> 32:00.371
- HEY. IT'S BEN'S LAB PARTNER.

32:00.410 --> 32:02.378
- WHEN BEN CALLED AND SAID
THAT HE'D BEEN ARRESTED,

32:02.420 --> 32:03.944
I RUSHED RIGHT OVER.

32:03.990 --> 32:05.241
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT HE DID THIS.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.541
- WE DON'T THINK SO EITHER.

32:06.590 --> 32:09.286
- YEAH, BUT WE NEED PROOF.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.051
- YOU KNOW, GUS AND I...

32:14.100 --> 32:16.398
DISCOVERED SOMETHING
PRETTY INTERESTING.

32:16.430 --> 32:19.695
- DID YOU TWO KNOW THAT WHEN
A TECH ENTERS BEN'S LAB,

32:19.730 --> 32:22.460
THEY HAVE TO SWIPE A SECURITY
CARD TO GAIN ENTRANCE?

32:22.500 --> 32:23.967
- GEE, GUS, I WISH
THERE WAS SOME KIND OF RECORD

32:24.010 --> 32:26.001
OF EXACTLY WHAT TIME
HE ENTERED AND EXITED

32:26.040 --> 32:27.302
ON THE DAY OF THE MURDER.

32:27.340 --> 32:29.308
- SOME KIND OF LOG.
- OR A REGISTRY.

32:29.340 --> 32:30.534
- LEDGER.
- DUCKIT.

32:30.580 --> 32:32.741
- DOCKET.
- I'VE HEARD IT--

32:32.780 --> 32:34.316
I HAVEN'T.

32:34.350 --> 32:37.274
[gasps] HEY, WHAT IS THAT
BEHIND YOUR EAR?

32:37.320 --> 32:39.743
[gasping]

32:39.790 --> 32:41.519
- WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

32:41.560 --> 32:44.757
IT'S THE ENTRANCE RECORD!

32:44.790 --> 32:46.451
- OH, ACCORDING TO THIS,

32:46.490 --> 32:47.684
BEN WAS WORKING
AT THE TIME OF THE MURDER.

32:47.730 --> 32:49.391
- WHAT?

32:49.430 --> 32:52.399
THERE'S NO WAY HE COULD
HAVE KILLED DESIREE.

32:52.430 --> 32:54.068
- AND NOW WE REVEL.
- ALIEN-STYLE.

32:54.100 --> 32:56.591
both: [high-pitched squeals]
EEEEE!

32:56.640 --> 32:58.665
- CONGRATULATIONS.
both: EE--

32:58.710 --> 33:00.507
- BUT YOU TWO
ARE FORGETTING SOMETHING.

33:00.540 --> 33:02.599
- WHAT'S THAT, OFFICER DAD?
- PART-TIME OFFICER DAD.

33:02.640 --> 33:04.449
- THERE'S STILL
A KILLER OUT THERE.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.674
GET TO WORK.

33:08.550 --> 33:11.485
- MMM.

33:11.520 --> 33:13.579
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT THIS CASE?

33:13.620 --> 33:16.555
ONE...THERE'S A WOMAN
WHO'S DEAD.

33:16.590 --> 33:19.229
- TWO, BEN DIDN'T KILL HER.

33:19.260 --> 33:21.194
- THREE, THESE JAPA DOGS
ARE DELICIOUS.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.788
- I HEAR THAT.

33:22.830 --> 33:24.422
- YOU GOTTA GIVE IT
TO THE JAPANESE.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.495
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
THEY INVENTED THE CHINESE.

33:26.530 --> 33:28.191
- YOU KNOW,
I ALMOST TOOK LASSITER

33:28.240 --> 33:30.060
TO THE JAPA DOG CART ONCE,
BUT I FELT LIKE I WAS CHEATING.

33:30.100 --> 33:32.068
- OH. THAT'S SO SWEET,
BUDDY.

33:32.110 --> 33:34.578
- MM.

33:34.610 --> 33:36.532
- HE WAS A CHEATING BASTARD.

33:36.580 --> 33:38.605
DESIREE FOUND OUT,
AND THEY HAD THIS HUGE FIGHT

33:38.650 --> 33:40.572
RIGHT BEFORE SHE DISAPPEARED.

33:40.610 --> 33:42.544
- WAIT A MINUTE.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.612
BEN...CHEATED...ON DESIREE.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.210
- YES, HE DID.
- WE NEVER FIGURED OUT WITH WHO.

33:50.260 --> 33:51.454
- HE DIDN'T SAY.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.651
SHE WOULD HAVE MOTIVE
TO KILL DESIREE.

33:53.690 --> 33:55.157
BINGO!

33:55.200 --> 33:57.350
- WE GOTTA
GET THAT OUT OF BEN.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.459
HOW COME YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO SAY BINGO WHEN I'M NOT?

33:59.500 --> 34:00.819
- THE SAME REASON YOU'RE NOT
ALLOWED TO SAY "TRUE DAT."

34:00.870 --> 34:03.191
- TRUE THAT.
- EXACTLY.

34:11.180 --> 34:13.546
- BUZZ, WHAT'S GOING ON, MAN?

34:13.580 --> 34:15.468
- THEY JUST PULLED A DEAD SURFER
OUT OF THE WATER.

34:15.520 --> 34:17.511
- DEAD--

34:18.620 --> 34:20.110
- BEN.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.782
OH, NO.

34:23.820 --> 34:25.549
BEN!

34:25.590 --> 34:28.127
- HE--HE'S DEAD, SHAWN.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.789
- OH, MAN.
- ONCE AGAIN...

34:36.840 --> 34:38.831
NO SIGN OF STRUGGLE.
FLUID IN THE LUNGS.

34:38.870 --> 34:40.565
IF THIS HAPPENED ONCE,
I WOULDN'T THINK AS MUCH OF IT,

34:40.610 --> 34:43.272
BUT TWICE IN ONE WEEK WITH
TWO VICTIMS WHO KNEW EACH OTHER?

34:43.310 --> 34:45.175
THAT'S MORE THAN SUSPICIOUS.

34:45.210 --> 34:46.677
WHAT WOULD BE REALLY
AWESOME

34:46.710 --> 34:49.247
IS IF IT HAPPENED
A THIRD TIME.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.282
- YOU'RE SAYING THAT BEN
AND DESIREE BOTH DROWNED,

34:51.320 --> 34:52.878
BUT NEITHER OF THEM ACTUALLY
DIED IN THE WATER.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.649
HOW'S THAT POSSIBLE?

34:54.690 --> 34:56.453
- THEY WERE DRY DROWNED.
- OH, COME ON, GUS.

34:56.490 --> 34:58.321
NOW YOU'RE JUST PUTTING WORDS
NEXT TO OTHER WORDS

34:58.360 --> 35:00.453
THAT SOUND LIKE THINGS
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

35:00.490 --> 35:02.629
- NO! ACTUALLY...
HE'S RIGHT.

35:02.660 --> 35:04.628
DRY DROWNING CAN GIVE
ALL THE APPEARANCES

35:04.670 --> 35:06.262
OF ACTUAL DROWNING.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.495
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE CAUSED
BY SOMETHING LIKE A...

35:08.540 --> 35:11.805
METHANE GAS LEAK
OR AN OVERDOSE OF ANESTH ESIA.

35:12.840 --> 35:14.307
- IF YOU'RE INTERESTED,

35:14.340 --> 35:16.331
YOU'LL HAVE TO SIGN
THE CONSENT FORMS.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.678
YOU'LL BE PUT
UNDER ANESTHESIA.

35:18.710 --> 35:19.904
- GUS, WE GOTTA GET BACK
TO THE LAB.

35:19.950 --> 35:22.771
YOU.

35:24.320 --> 35:25.878
- ALL RIGHT, WE CAME DOWN HERE
YA ASKED.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.842
NOW WHAT?
- LET'S BE HONEST.

35:27.890 --> 35:29.755
WE NEED YOU, AND YOU NEED US.

35:29.790 --> 35:32.782
LET US ALL WORK TOGETHER.
WATCH IT AND FEEL IT.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.252
- I REFUSE TO WATCH,

35:34.300 --> 35:35.858
AND I'M SURE AS HELL
NOT GONNA FEEL IT.

35:35.900 --> 35:37.390
- FEEL WHAT, SHAWN?

35:37.430 --> 35:39.796
- WE'RE ABOUT TO GET
OURSELVES A CONFESSION.

35:42.770 --> 35:44.863
TONYA.
GOT BAD NEWS.

35:44.910 --> 35:47.208
THESE ARE COPS,
THIS IS DION RICHMOND--

35:47.240 --> 35:48.605
- NO, I'M NOT.
- I'M A PSYCHIC.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.870
I SEE THINGS,
AND I FEEL THINGS.

35:50.910 --> 35:52.468
- DO YOU WANNA FEEL
WHAT YOU SEE?

35:52.510 --> 35:53.738
- I CAN'T LOSE
WITH THIS GIRL.

35:53.780 --> 35:54.940
- HAVE YOU NO SHAME?

35:54.980 --> 35:56.311
- I'M NOT HERE TO PLAY
TWIST AND PULL!

35:56.350 --> 35:58.181
NOT WITH
A COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

35:58.220 --> 35:59.414
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT HAD
AN AFFAIR WITH BEN.

35:59.450 --> 36:01.179
DON'T DENY IT.
- GUILTY AS CHARGED.

36:01.220 --> 36:03.518
- BOOM...SHAKA!

36:03.560 --> 36:05.653
THAT'S GOTTA BE A NEW RECORD.
- WHAT!

36:05.690 --> 36:07.180
- CUFF HER, LASSIE.
- WHAT? IT'S NOT LIKE

36:07.230 --> 36:09.653
HE CROAKED
WHILE WE WERE DOING IT.

36:09.700 --> 36:11.668
- YOU WANTED BEN
ALL FOR YOURSELF.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.520
- NO, I DIDN'T.

36:13.570 --> 36:16.664
WE HOOKED UP ONCE,
AND HE TOTALLY FREAKED OUT.

36:16.700 --> 36:19.828
HE LOVED HIS GIRL.
WHATEVER. THE BEAT GOES ON.

36:19.870 --> 36:21.201
- NOT BEN'S.
- LIKELY STORY.

36:21.240 --> 36:22.878
YOU HAD ACCESS
TO THE AN ESTHESIA

36:22.910 --> 36:24.673
THAT DRY...

36:24.710 --> 36:26.644
DROWNED HIM.

36:26.680 --> 36:28.341
- I'M A PART-TIME ASSISTANT.

36:28.380 --> 36:31.679
I MEAN, DO YOU THINK THEY
ACTUALLY LET ME NEAR THAT STUFF?

36:31.720 --> 36:33.847
MY SECURITY BADGE GETS ME
IN AND OUT OF THE FRONT DOOR

36:33.890 --> 36:34.811
AND INTO THE BATHROOM.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.884
I DON'T GET ANYWHERE NEAR

36:35.920 --> 36:37.956
THE ACTUAL EXPERIMENTS.

36:37.990 --> 36:41.255
YOU'D HAVE TO GO TO DEVRY
OR SOMETHING FOR THAT.

36:48.030 --> 36:51.568
- YES. INTERESTING, INDEED.

36:51.610 --> 36:52.963
ALMOST LOOKS LIKE FREEZER BURN.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.898
I'M CALLING AN AUDIBLE.

36:54.940 --> 36:57.579
I'M SENSING SOMETHING
VERY STRONG.

36:57.610 --> 37:00.477
I'M GETTING A STRONG,
JEALOUS...

37:00.510 --> 37:04.480
SPITEFUL. ..
SPIRIT VIBE HERE.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.681
RIGHT...IN HERE.

37:06.720 --> 37:09.780
IT'S STRONG HERE,
BUT MOSTLY HERE.

37:09.820 --> 37:13.426
YES.
YOU. LILLIAN.

37:13.460 --> 37:15.951
YOU WERE JEALOUS OF BEN
AND DESIREE'S RELATIONSHIP.

37:16.000 --> 37:18.594
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
- MISS, EXCUSE ME.

37:18.630 --> 37:20.291
WE'LL GET TO YOU IN A SECOND.
SPENCER, WHAT'S THE DEAL?

37:20.330 --> 37:21.934
AM I CUFFING CHARLOTTE
THE HARLOT OR WHAT?

37:21.970 --> 37:24.905
- NO. SORRY.
YOU AND I ARE BACK ON DIRTY.

37:24.940 --> 37:27.033
LILLIAN KILLED DESIREE BLAKE

37:27.070 --> 37:28.879
BECAUSE SHE WANTED BEN
ALL FOR HERSELF.

37:28.910 --> 37:31.470
- THAT'S CRAZY.
- MAYBE IT ISN'T.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.978
IN YOUR STATEMENT TO US,
YOU DID REFER TO BEN

37:34.010 --> 37:35.409
AS A GREAT BOYFRIEND,

37:35.450 --> 37:36.940
AND YOU SHOWED UP TO GET HIM
OUT OF JAIL

37:36.980 --> 37:38.538
BEFORE WE'D EVEN
FINISHED PROCESSING HIM.

37:38.590 --> 37:40.979
- COME ON.
OF COURSE YOU FELL FOR HIM.

37:41.020 --> 37:42.885
HE WAS YCFILER PARTNER.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.319
HE SHARED HIS PROBLEMS
WITH YOU.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.782
HE CONFIDED IN YOU.
HE TRUSTED YOU.

37:45.830 --> 37:47.559
- BUT BEN NEVER
REFERRED TO HER

37:47.590 --> 37:49.558
AS ANYTHING OTHER THAN
A COWORKER.

37:49.600 --> 37:51.022
COME ON, IT'S OBVIOUS
WHY HE'D GO FOR THAT ONE--

37:51.060 --> 37:51.719
SHE'S EASY.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.067
- I WAS MORE THAN A COWORKER.

37:53.100 --> 37:56.536
I CARED FOR HIM.

37:56.570 --> 37:59.368
EVERYONE KNEW THAT BEN AND
DESIREE WERE GETTING MARRIED.

37:59.410 --> 38:01.571
- [gaSPSJ
BEN MADE A MISTAKE

38:01.610 --> 38:02.577
AND CHEATED ON DESIREE.

38:02.610 --> 38:03.838
SHE MOVED OUT,

38:03.880 --> 38:05.404
AND YOU SAW THAT
AS YOUR OPPORTUNITY.

38:05.450 --> 38:07.372
- HEY, WHO ARE YOU
CALLING A MISTAKE?

38:07.410 --> 38:08.946
- ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

38:08.980 --> 38:11.517
- HOW DID I MISS THIS?

38:14.960 --> 38:17.611
- WHAT IS HE DOING?
- IT GIVES HIM CLARITY.

38:19.090 --> 38:21.422
- YEAH, LASSIE, I DON'T THINK
WE HAVE TIME...

38:21.460 --> 38:22.950
TO GIVE THE SAVION GLOVER
TREATMENT--

38:23.000 --> 38:24.968
- SHH!

38:25.000 --> 38:28.390
- EVEN AFTER BEN CHEATED,

38:28.440 --> 38:29.862
HE STILL PINED FOR DESIREE.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.333
HE WANTED HER BACK,
AND YOU REALIZED

38:31.370 --> 38:33.338
YOU WOULD HAVE TO
GET RID OF HER FOR GOOD.

38:33.370 --> 38:35.008
SO YOU BROUGHT HER
TO THIS LAB

38:35.040 --> 38:37.929
AND GAVE HER
A HIGH DOSE OF ANESTHESIA

38:37.980 --> 38:39.868
THAT CAUSED HER TO
[loudly] DRY DROWN!

38:39.910 --> 38:41.946
- I TAUGHT HIM THAT.
- TRUST US, WE KNOW.

38:41.980 --> 38:43.777
- THEN YOU JUST HAD TO
GET RID OF THE BODY.

38:43.820 --> 38:45.549
SO YOU PUT DESIREE
BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER CAR,

38:45.590 --> 38:46.943
AND YOU DROVE IT
INTO THE LAKE,

38:46.990 --> 38:48.651
WEIGHING DOWN THE ACCELERATOR

38:48.690 --> 38:50.612
WITH ONE OF THOSE BIG BLOCKS
OF FROZEN WATER

38:50.660 --> 38:54.027
THAT YOU USE
FOR FREEZING LAB SAMPLES.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.968
- DRY ICE IS NOT FROZEN WATER.
IT'S CARBON DIOXIDE.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.991
THEY DO SHARE THE SAME
PRINCIPLE IN TERMS OF--

39:01.030 --> 39:02.964
- NOT NOW, GUS.
I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU NOW.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.831
THE POINT IS,
THE EVIDENCE MELTED.

39:04.870 --> 39:06.633
VERY CLEVER.

39:06.670 --> 39:08.399
AND ALL YOU HAD TO DO
WAS BE THERE FOR BEN,

39:08.440 --> 39:09.976
AND HE WOULD FALL FOR YOU LIKE
YOU HAD ALREADY FALLEN FOR HIM.

39:10.010 --> 39:13.002
- EXCEPT HE DIDN'T FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.416
- I WANNA FIND THE PERSON
WHO DID THIS MORE THAN ANYTHING.

39:15.450 --> 39:17.975
- YOU WERE SO DELUSIONAL,

39:18.020 --> 39:20.614
YOU THOUGHT HE WOULD BE TOUCHED
BY YOUR MURDEROUS ACT.

39:20.650 --> 39:21.981
OF COURSE, HE WAS NOT,

39:22.020 --> 39:24.727
BECAUSE YOU ARE
A CRAZY DRY DROWNER.

39:24.760 --> 39:25.886
AND IN THE HEAT
OF THE MOMENT,

39:25.930 --> 39:28.057
IT WAS EITHER YOU OR HIM.

39:28.090 --> 39:30.593
- AND YOU CHOSE YOU!
- NICE, LASSIE.

39:30.630 --> 39:32.996
WAY TO TAP YOUR WAY
BACK TO THE PARTY.

39:33.030 --> 39:35.498
- A SECOND REVIEW OF THE BODY
WILL TRACE THE AN ESTHESIA

39:35.540 --> 39:37.428
USED TO KILL THEM
BACK TO YOUR LAB.

39:37.470 --> 39:39.062
- HE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN WITH ME.

39:39.110 --> 39:42.830
THIS IS ALL HER FAULT.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.871
- HANDS BEHIND
YOUR BACK, PLEASE.

39:44.910 --> 39:45.979
- WELL PLAYED, SHAWN.

39:46.010 --> 39:47.546
- WELL PLAYED, EVERYBODY.

39:47.580 --> 39:49.411
WAY TO ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.

39:49.450 --> 39:51.418
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHICH
WAY IT'S GONNA COME AND GO.

39:51.450 --> 39:52.587
PSYCHICALLY SPEAKING.

39:54.690 --> 39:56.954
- THANK YOU FOR
AGREEING TO MEET ME.

39:56.990 --> 39:58.685
- SURE.
- LET'S HOPE THIS GOES BETTER

39:58.730 --> 40:00.925
THAN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
- YES! LET'S.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.793
- NOT THAT THEY WERE...
THAT BAD.

40:03.830 --> 40:05.764
- THEY WERE HORRIFIC.

[hip-hop music plays]

41:12.900 --> 41:14.561

42:03.620 --> 42:07.010

THE WEST SIDE RAPIST IS.

42:07.050 --> 42:10.053
- AND THAT'S...MY PARTNER.

42:10.090 --> 42:13.321

ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR.
