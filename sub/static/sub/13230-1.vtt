<i>...authorities say they've been
looking for the little girl</i>

00:48.849 --> 00:49.975
<i>for the past two months.</i>

00:50.084 --> 00:51.882
<i>Hopefully, they can find her soon.</i>

00:51.986 --> 00:55.320
<i>Meanwhile, you're listening
to KWDD, the Dust Devil,</i>

00:55.423 --> 00:57.482
<i>here in the Valley of Lordsburg.</i>

00:57.591 --> 00:59.753
<i>I'm good ol' Jack Tumbleweed.</i>

00:59.860 --> 01:02.056
<i>Here's one that I've been keyed in</i>

01:02.163 --> 01:05.758
<i>on KWDD, the Dust Devil.</i>

01:05.866 --> 01:07.925
Hey, what about me?

01:12.974 --> 01:14.203
So how do you know it's even a girl?

01:15.409 --> 01:16.399
I know so.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.338
Damn, someone's in a hurry!

01:21.449 --> 01:23.008
Her brother was in my unit.

01:23.150 --> 01:25.482
- PFC Reynolds.
-Oh, really?

01:25.619 --> 01:29.487
And how does Private First Class Reynolds
feel about you and his sister?

01:30.958 --> 01:33.086
I doubt he really cares.

01:33.194 --> 01:35.094
- And why is that?
-'Cause he's dead.

01:39.867 --> 01:42.165
They'd write each other letters.

01:42.269 --> 01:45.637
He sent a picture of the both of us,
so she asked him about me.

01:45.740 --> 01:47.230
The only person I had to write

01:47.341 --> 01:49.776
while I was over there was like my pops.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.505
She and I have
kept in touch over the years.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.274
What's her name?

01:54.382 --> 01:55.543
Sarah.

01:57.318 --> 01:58.581
You got a picture?

02:05.426 --> 02:07.053
Whoa! She's a babe!

02:07.161 --> 02:09.596
She is very pretty.

02:09.697 --> 02:10.721
Ooh, I want to see.

02:10.830 --> 02:13.425
Uh, you need to pay attention
to the road, mister.

02:13.534 --> 02:14.660
Oh, come on.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.136
Well, maybe you should invite her.

02:21.242 --> 02:22.232
To what?

02:25.279 --> 02:26.872
You didn't tell him?

02:29.550 --> 02:31.018
Babe, I didn't tell anyone.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.108
Really?

02:32.219 --> 02:33.948
What's the big deal?

02:36.657 --> 02:39.183
We are getting married.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.658
What the fuck?

02:40.761 --> 02:42.058
Congratulations.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.221
Dude, are you serious?

02:43.330 --> 02:45.526
yeah, man. Next Spring.

02:46.667 --> 02:50.160
Oh, look, babe, a rest stop.
I need to pee.

02:50.271 --> 02:52.239
I second that notion.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.253
Ugh, that's disgusting.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.747
Thanks, man.

04:07.848 --> 04:09.577
For what?

04:09.683 --> 04:12.084
For this. You know,
you guys coming with me

04:12.186 --> 04:15.087
and driving me and all. Thanks.

04:15.189 --> 04:17.452
Don't mention it

04:22.696 --> 04:24.323
It's just like old times.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.929
Dude, I can't believe
you're getting married.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.829
Yeah, me too.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.307
I was like...
kind of thought you'd be the last.

04:37.311 --> 04:42.272
Well, it looks like old Jude here
is gonna be the last.

04:42.383 --> 04:46.752
Yeah, yeah. Well, boys, I gotta go
talk to a man about a horse.

04:46.854 --> 04:50.620
Hey, the ladies' is on the right side.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.204
Be outside, babe.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.378
<i>Hey! -</i>

05:14.715 --> 05:15.807
Hey, baby cakes.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.510
Wanna go for a ride?

05:18.619 --> 05:21.145
You want me to show
you boys how to ride that thing?

05:22.923 --> 05:23.947
Any time, doll.

06:47.374 --> 06:48.637
Hey, you guys ready to go?

06:48.742 --> 06:50.574
Hey, Alice, where's Jill?

06:50.678 --> 06:52.043
Same place she's been.

06:52.146 --> 06:54.274
In the shitter, dude.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.974
Alice, can you go check on her?

06:56.083 --> 06:57.050
Yeah.

07:00.521 --> 07:04.754
Hey, I've been waiting for the girls
to be gone. Check this out.

07:16.170 --> 07:19.231
Hey, are you done yet?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.178
Seriously, we're gonna leave you.

07:27.848 --> 07:31.307
This is the only thing
my old man gave me before he died.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.045
Jill?

07:39.126 --> 07:40.184
Jill?

07:45.566 --> 07:49.833
Nolan! She's not in there!

07:53.707 --> 07:55.539
What do you mean she's not in there?

07:55.642 --> 07:57.167
She's just not in there.

08:04.818 --> 08:05.842
Jill!

08:20.100 --> 08:21.625
Did you see her come out?

08:21.769 --> 08:22.702
No.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.196
Neithed did I.

08:26.306 --> 08:27.899
She couldn't have gone too far.

08:33.447 --> 08:34.471
Jill!

08:36.183 --> 08:37.116
Jill!

08:41.087 --> 08:42.486
Jill!

08:42.589 --> 08:45.183
Jill!
Jill!

08:45.292 --> 08:46.384
Really?

08:48.962 --> 08:49.895
Jill!

08:52.132 --> 08:53.531
Jill!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.730
Where is she?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.536
Are you sure she didn't leave before you?

09:02.643 --> 09:04.543
No, she was in there when I walked out.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.044
Okay, calm down.
Let's just think about it.

09:06.146 --> 09:07.113
No!

09:07.214 --> 09:09.706
Where could she have gone?

09:09.817 --> 09:12.752
Come on, guys.
We're talking about Jill here.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.083
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

09:16.290 --> 09:17.758
I'm just saying, man.

09:17.858 --> 09:18.791
Dillon, shut up.

09:18.892 --> 09:22.294
Maybe she got scared.
You know, there were those bikers.

09:22.396 --> 09:24.125
- The fucking bikers.
-What?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.427
- The fucking bikers.
-What about 'em?

09:26.533 --> 09:28.968
Come on,
we gotta catch up with them.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.036
Come on!

09:53.026 --> 09:55.927
- Maybe we should just--
-Shut the fuck up, Jude!

09:59.666 --> 10:01.794
You don't wanna help,
you can get out now.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.927
But how do you know
that she's with them?

10:14.982 --> 10:16.381
Nolan, dude.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.178
Man, shut the fuck up.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.379
what of jude's right?

10:29.396 --> 10:31.956
Did you see the way
those guys looked at Alice?

10:32.065 --> 10:34.659
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
that they took Jill.

10:39.606 --> 10:41.199
you got any other ideas?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.675
I thought the war
would have made you a man,

10:43.777 --> 10:45.108
but you're being a little fuck...

10:45.212 --> 10:47.146
Hold your fucking mouth right there!

10:52.953 --> 10:54.819
This is stupid.

10:54.922 --> 10:56.720
Shut up,Alice.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.918
There was no one else there,
and that one fucking guy!

11:10.437 --> 11:13.065
Nolan. Dude!

11:20.013 --> 11:22.345
What? You pussin' out, too?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.749
If you want, I can drop all your
asses off and take care of this myself.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.589
I didn't say I was pussin' out.

11:34.695 --> 11:37.687
I'm just sayin', how do you know
that they even got her?

11:37.798 --> 11:40.495
Because there was nobody else there.

11:40.601 --> 11:44.299
Because...
Fucking because...

11:44.404 --> 11:46.395
She's all I've got, man.

11:48.842 --> 11:50.105
There they are.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.896
Did you see anything?

12:19.006 --> 12:21.236
You drove passed them
like a hundred miles an hour.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.740
How the hell are we supposed to know?

12:28.382 --> 12:30.248
Shit! She's gotta be in the van.

12:40.060 --> 12:43.052
Alice, stay here.
Dillon, come on, open the trunk.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.255
what?
look, man

12:44.364 --> 12:47.459
in about three seconds those bikers are
gonna be upon us. Now, open the trunk.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.762
So, now...

12:50.003 --> 12:51.664
Fuck it, Nolan. Just do it.

13:01.782 --> 13:04.114
Babe, just stay in the car.

14:09.483 --> 14:11.577
You boys wanna tell me
what the fuck you're doing?

14:11.685 --> 14:15.019
I'm looking for my girlfriend

14:19.426 --> 14:21.554
Look, man...

14:21.661 --> 14:24.028
No, you look!

14:24.131 --> 14:27.032
Where is she, motherfucker?

14:27.134 --> 14:29.933
Nobody puts a gun in my face.

14:30.036 --> 14:32.528
Yeah, well, I just did, asshole!

14:35.609 --> 14:37.941
Think you're a man because you got a gun?

14:39.880 --> 14:41.405
Tell him to get out.

14:47.354 --> 14:51.518
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Don't move!

14:52.793 --> 14:56.423
Tell that asshole
to get the fuck out of the van!

15:03.003 --> 15:05.404
Now, look,

15:05.505 --> 15:09.305
you boys have no idea what
you've gotten yourselves into here.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.375
Now, I'm gonna give you a chance

15:13.480 --> 15:17.212
to get your tight little assess
in your pretty little car

15:17.317 --> 15:21.151
and drive the fuck away,
and we forget about this.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.781
I'm the one making
the rules here, not you!

15:26.560 --> 15:30.519
My girlfriend was at the rest stop
and now she's gone,

15:30.630 --> 15:33.258
and you fucks were the only ones there.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.494
Sit the fuck down!

15:37.270 --> 15:39.898
Answer my fucking question!

15:48.014 --> 15:52.474
Well, I tried...
tried to be decent,

15:52.586 --> 15:56.853
but now, you done fucked up.

16:03.196 --> 16:04.357
Now...

16:07.067 --> 16:10.935
What we got here is a Mexican standoff.

16:11.037 --> 16:12.596
You know what that is, boy?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.046
That's where I shoot you,

16:20.146 --> 16:21.272
and he shoots him.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.679
And i blow off tour fucking head.

16:26.953 --> 16:28.648
Hey, fat-ass,

16:28.755 --> 16:31.816
unless you wanna
see the insides of this man,

16:31.925 --> 16:33.950
I suggest you drop it.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.056
Now, any of you others carrying,

16:37.163 --> 16:39.655
or just Mama Bear and Tinker Bell here?

16:44.437 --> 16:46.337
Oh, okay.
Real hard-asses, huh?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.334
Line up over there!

16:52.779 --> 16:54.543
Did I fucking stutter?

17:08.795 --> 17:12.925
Now, my friend here asked you
a simple fucking question

17:13.032 --> 17:16.230
that deserves a simple fucking answer.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.599
Did you see the girl?

17:23.777 --> 17:25.711
Fuck you.

17:25.811 --> 17:29.544
I will not hesitate to kill
every last one of you!

17:30.984 --> 17:32.543
Give me your fucking keys!

17:36.623 --> 17:40.287
All right.
Now, this is how it's gonna go.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.987
You boys are gonna walk to those hills

17:43.096 --> 17:45.258
until you don't see us anymore.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.924
Easy enough?

17:47.033 --> 17:49.229
This is not the end of the road.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.306
It's just a detour.
It's not the end of this.

17:52.405 --> 17:56.535
Yeah, it is.
Now turn around, beat your feet.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.351
You're dead.

18:19.232 --> 18:21.098
Where the fuck did that come from?

18:22.969 --> 18:26.166
Yeah, I don't even know what to say.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.058
What happened?

18:50.163 --> 18:51.927
They didn't have her.

18:52.032 --> 18:53.898
What do you mean they didn't have her?
How do you know?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.695
Well, I checked the van
and she wasn't there.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.032
I'm going back to the rest stop.

18:58.138 --> 18:59.697
just drive.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.830
No, I'm going back.

19:00.940 --> 19:03.602
Nolan, she isn't back there.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.474
I still think we should
go back to the rest stop.

19:05.578 --> 19:08.047
Nolan, just drive!

19:08.148 --> 19:10.048
But what if she's back there?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.879
Yeah. I mean, we can't just leave her.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.282
She isn't back there.

19:14.888 --> 19:16.686
How can you be so sure?

19:17.824 --> 19:20.521
Well, I'm not, but going back there
just doesn't make sense.

19:20.627 --> 19:22.652
She could've just gotten scared.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.956
Look, man, the best thing we can do now

19:27.067 --> 19:29.161
is find the law around here.

19:31.071 --> 19:32.971
I think we can handle this.

19:33.073 --> 19:34.632
Didn't you see their colors?

19:34.741 --> 19:36.971
- Whose colors?
-The bikers.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.445
- Colors? What do you mean colors?
-You cut their fuel lines.

19:42.549 --> 19:46.076
That isn't gonna stop them.
It's just gonna slow 'em down.

19:46.186 --> 19:49.212
They're not gonna forget
what just happened.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.348
Hey, what do you mean colors?

19:52.459 --> 19:54.120
It means they belong to something.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.753
And they were on a schedule.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.230
- What do you mean schedule?
-Oh, shit!

19:59.332 --> 20:00.731
It doesn't matter.

20:00.834 --> 20:04.134
We just need to find the law around here.

20:04.237 --> 20:06.228
Where the fuck could she be?

20:09.242 --> 20:14.203
Okay, Alice, where was she whenever
you left the bathroom?

20:14.314 --> 20:16.043
She was in the stall.

20:16.149 --> 20:18.277
Okay. Was there anyone else
in there with you?

20:19.986 --> 20:23.320
Not that I know of.
I didn't see anyone.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.255
Dillon, was there any other cars there?

20:27.327 --> 20:28.419
No.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.720
You were in the bathroom when Jill was.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.492
Did you hear anything?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.898
Just some strange noises.

20:36.002 --> 20:37.731
What do you mean noises?

20:38.872 --> 20:40.567
Um.

20:41.975 --> 20:44.535
It was like a dog whimpering
or something.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.105
The real weird thing, though,

20:48.214 --> 20:50.012
was all these fliers of missing people.

20:51.184 --> 20:53.482
- There were stacks of them.
-Oh, God.

20:57.590 --> 21:01.925
Wait, I did!
I saw a purple Cadillac pull up,

21:02.028 --> 21:04.292
right before we left

21:04.397 --> 21:07.094
Like the one from the highway?

21:09.536 --> 21:11.664
I think so.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.637
What are you talking about?

21:13.740 --> 21:16.402
The car that passed us on the highway.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.738
<i>I was at the stop?</i>

21:17.844 --> 21:19.471
I think.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.142
Come on. We'll find her.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.186
Jill, come on, baby.
Where are you?

21:44.571 --> 21:47.632
Oh, you son of a bitch!

21:47.740 --> 21:50.300
Those fuckers cut our fuel lines.

21:52.745 --> 21:54.509
They cut this tire, too.

22:09.596 --> 22:12.531
Man, you got lucky.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.932
Mickey doesn't usually
let prospects off so easily.

22:16.035 --> 22:19.164
Nah, Mickey is just smart.

22:19.272 --> 22:22.003
He'll be whooping my ass
after I get his bike up and running.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.167
Rev, you find those keys yet?

22:24.277 --> 22:25.904
Sure thing.

22:28.081 --> 22:33.542
Hold on to 'em. It's gonna be
a long time before you're riding again.

22:33.653 --> 22:35.678
<i>Though, hey. hey.</i>

22:35.788 --> 22:42.091
If you can get these bikes
and the wagon up and running again...

22:42.195 --> 22:45.028
Fifteen.
Can you do it?

22:47.567 --> 22:52.004
I can get the wagon,
two of them bikes up and running.

22:52.105 --> 22:53.800
I don't know about that third.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.643
Get mine and Derek's going.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.806
We'll pick up Victor's on the way back.

23:02.949 --> 23:07.011
- What about my bike?
-Did I ask?

23:07.120 --> 23:11.557
No. Help him.
Fix the tire.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.359
All  right.

24:00.039 --> 24:01.268
Damn it.

24:02.975 --> 24:07.469
I haven't seen a soul for miles,
and we really need gas.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.880
We were sitting on a quarter of a tank.
How did you expect...

24:11.017 --> 24:17.115
Hey, I didn't expect to be traveling
the back woods of this fucking state!

24:17.223 --> 24:19.123
Oh, yeah. It was a shortcut.

24:19.225 --> 24:23.856
No. It was Jill's idea.

24:23.963 --> 24:26.057
What did you say, pussy?

24:26.165 --> 24:29.533
no, stop!Fucking stop!

24:29.635 --> 24:32.730
- Fuck you, Nolan!
-Dillon, shut up.

24:32.839 --> 24:35.934
-What?
-I said stop the car.

25:18.050 --> 25:22.180
Well, we're almost out of gas.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.313
It may be our only chance.

25:30.830 --> 25:33.595
Goddamn fuckin'...

25:46.646 --> 25:49.616
Come on.
Come on now.

25:49.715 --> 25:51.877
Ain't that hard.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.351
See, you pulling it off.

25:54.454 --> 25:59.016
What are you yelling about
your clothes for, huh? There we go.

26:03.863 --> 26:06.958
We should've buried those kids.

26:07.066 --> 26:09.228
Whe shold've buried'em

26:09.335 --> 26:14.034
But instead, my bike is gonna
be sitting out here in the desert...

26:16.108 --> 26:17.940
rusting in some bush.

26:22.548 --> 26:23.982
You Know...

26:26.285 --> 26:31.280
If it were up to me,
we'd be moving dirt right now.

26:33.860 --> 26:36.557
What would you have done about the car?

26:43.236 --> 26:47.139
Hmm? Don't be shy.

26:47.240 --> 26:49.174
What would you do about the car?

26:55.448 --> 26:59.146
I would've parked it in the desert.

26:59.252 --> 27:04.315
How about that.
What next? Come on. Go on.

27:11.397 --> 27:15.095
Well, we...
We would've just rode off.

27:20.406 --> 27:23.740
<i>Check the wagon for the dope'?</i>

27:23.843 --> 27:25.402
You didn't, did you?

27:29.181 --> 27:31.912
Stupid piece of shit!

27:36.422 --> 27:41.155
I like this road!
Nobody gives us any problems!

27:43.796 --> 27:48.597
Now, is pride more important
than making our delivery?

27:48.701 --> 27:50.692
No

27:55.508 --> 27:58.500
Now, if you'd kept
your fuckin' mouth shut, you'd know,

27:58.611 --> 28:02.343
you and Rev are gonna go
make the delivery.

28:02.448 --> 28:06.180
Derek and I are gonna go
take care of the pride.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.845
Does that work for you?

28:29.875 --> 28:31.206
Yeah.

28:32.445 --> 28:36.211
Good. I aims to please.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.616
Rev, you got the bikes ready?

28:43.723 --> 28:44.656
Yes, sir.

28:44.790 --> 28:48.192
Good! Derek, let's go.

30:03.936 --> 30:04.960
Hello?

30:13.079 --> 30:16.640
Hey! Anybody?

30:18.918 --> 30:20.818
Let's go look around.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.424
It doesn't look like anyone's
been here in quite some time.

31:07.533 --> 31:08.466
Yeah.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.982
What the hell is that?

31:47.773 --> 31:49.104
What are you doing?

31:49.208 --> 31:52.200
- What the fuck, man?
-What the hell are you doing?

31:52.311 --> 31:54.643
- Trying to get to the phone.
-Not like that.

31:54.747 --> 31:56.681
What is your problem?

31:56.782 --> 31:59.774
The last time I listened to you,
I had to put a gun in a man's face,

31:59.885 --> 32:02.252
and I'm not gonna do that again.

32:02.354 --> 32:05.346
Fuck, I should've gone back
to the rest stop!

32:05.457 --> 32:07.926
Are you crazy?
She isn't back there, you idiot!

32:12.865 --> 32:14.026
Stop it!

32:14.133 --> 32:15.464
Jude, come on!

32:26.679 --> 32:30.638
The last thing we need right now
is these people to find us in their place.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.410
We don't need another mess.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.457
Fuck you!

32:44.730 --> 32:46.164
Fuck all of you!

32:47.733 --> 32:50.134
We should've gone back!

32:50.236 --> 32:54.696
Jill's out there, alone, and I'm
the only one who seems to give a shit!

32:58.043 --> 32:59.636
Dillon, just let him cool off.

33:23.903 --> 33:25.268
Let me see your eye.

33:25.371 --> 33:27.271
It's fine.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.068
Maybe we should've gone back.

33:29.174 --> 33:30.835
For what?

33:42.821 --> 33:44.084
Hello?

34:16.722 --> 34:20.317
Ugh! What the hell is that?

34:40.112 --> 34:41.670
What was that?

34:41.780 --> 34:43.248
What?

34:43.349 --> 34:45.147
I don't know,
but I'm pretty sure I saw something.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.446
- Where?
-Just over there.

34:53.058 --> 34:55.583
It must have been a dog or something.
We probably just spooked it.

34:55.694 --> 35:00.029
What I saw was larger than a dog, Jude.

35:00.132 --> 35:01.531
Maybe it was a grizzly

35:01.633 --> 35:04.625
Yeah, because grizzlies
roam the buildings in the desert

35:04.737 --> 35:06.796
Hey, you never know.

35:20.919 --> 35:24.378
help me , please!

35:24.490 --> 35:26.686
Somebody help!

35:29.561 --> 35:31.461
Somebody help!

35:38.003 --> 35:39.562
We need to get the fuck out of here.

35:39.671 --> 35:40.900
I was hoping you would say that.

35:41.006 --> 35:43.475
There's something about
this place just ain't right.

35:48.847 --> 35:53.080
I didn't say anything earlier,
but when we pulled in,

35:53.185 --> 35:56.553
I could've sworn there was
someone right over there.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.317
Why didn't you say anything then?

35:59.425 --> 36:00.551
I thought I was seeing things.

36:00.659 --> 36:03.492
It doesn't matter. We just need
to find Nolan and get out of here.

36:03.595 --> 36:05.029
Where is Nolan?

36:19.645 --> 36:21.170
Is somebody there?

36:29.755 --> 36:30.881
Fuck this.

36:36.662 --> 36:40.929
We're halfway there,
and we get our asses kicked again.

36:41.033 --> 36:43.468
Again?
because..yeah, again.again.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.731
I haven't gotten my ass kicked.

36:45.838 --> 36:48.830
- At least not today.
-Shut up, Rev. Shut your...

36:52.478 --> 36:55.607
Just wait till I come up.
You know it and I know it, okay?

36:55.714 --> 36:58.809
- Yeah.
-lt's gonna happen. It's gonna...

37:03.789 --> 37:05.985
Hold it. slow down.

37:09.695 --> 37:10.753
What's that sign say?

37:10.863 --> 37:11.989
It looks like gas up there.

37:17.436 --> 37:21.202
Let's make that-- Make a right.
Make a right, right here. Okay.

37:42.094 --> 37:43.721
Oh, shit!

38:04.049 --> 38:06.313
Oh, shit. The bikers.

38:09.188 --> 38:10.622
Dillon!

38:10.722 --> 38:13.123
- Did you find Nolan?
-No, we've got another problem.

38:15.527 --> 38:17.291
- Shit, where are we going?
-Hide!

39:18.023 --> 39:19.923
Now they're not going anywhere.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.195
Sure we should've stopped here, though?

39:31.970 --> 39:34.530
We're not.

39:36.675 --> 39:39.110
Don't worry.

39:39.211 --> 39:40.906
The shipment will make it.

39:41.013 --> 39:43.414
It'll make it. It'll make it.

39:48.320 --> 39:53.986
Besides... we take care
of this business here,

39:55.994 --> 39:59.760
and you'll be getting
your colors soon, son. All right?

39:59.865 --> 40:01.731
I just don't want Mickey on my ass.

40:01.833 --> 40:04.632
Don't you worry about Mickey, all right?

40:04.736 --> 40:08.138
What you gotta worry about
is me, putting my foot...

40:10.042 --> 40:13.444
Rev, what the fuck am I looking at?

40:13.545 --> 40:15.741
Hey! Hey, boy.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.709
Come on.

40:26.091 --> 40:28.423
The hell's he wearing on his head?

40:30.896 --> 40:33.558
I don't know. It's kid shit.

40:42.274 --> 40:44.333
Didn't your mama teach you to share?

40:50.215 --> 40:52.741
Mean little son of a bitch, ain't you?

40:57.189 --> 40:59.248
Hey, where are your folks, kid?

41:04.062 --> 41:07.293
Oh, does that mean you ain't got none?

41:17.008 --> 41:19.170
Come on. Come on!

41:47.439 --> 41:50.033
- What the fuck was that?
-It doesn't matter.

41:50.142 --> 41:52.509
- What about Nolan?
-If he saw that, he's already gone.

41:55.580 --> 41:56.741
Stay down.

42:38.256 --> 42:39.451
Who are you?

42:42.027 --> 42:43.756
Why are my hands tied?

42:45.864 --> 42:47.889
Did you hear me?

42:47.999 --> 42:50.434
Why are my fucking hands tied?

42:53.705 --> 42:55.264
Answer me!

43:03.682 --> 43:05.946
You're just gonna leave me here?

43:09.020 --> 43:10.579
Come on!

43:21.867 --> 43:24.336
Jill? Jill!

43:26.404 --> 43:28.668
You leave her alone, you fucker!

43:33.345 --> 43:35.814
Don't touch her, motherfucker!

43:40.418 --> 43:44.013
Look, man, just...
Just listen, please.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.158
Fuck!

43:59.037 --> 44:03.338
Jill, come on, baby.
Please, wake up.

44:05.410 --> 44:07.708
Wake up, Jill. Wake up!

44:53.592 --> 44:57.153
Jill? What did you do to her?

45:09.107 --> 45:10.632
What are you doing?

46:51.209 --> 46:53.678
Oh, wait.

46:53.778 --> 46:56.975
What? No. Don't...

46:57.082 --> 46:59.847
No! No!

47:06.424 --> 47:10.657
No! You're dead!
Do you hear me?

47:10.762 --> 47:12.696
You're fucking dead!

47:12.797 --> 47:14.993
I'm gonna cut your fucking heads off!

47:16.901 --> 47:18.835
You son of a bitch!

48:05.850 --> 48:08.979
I'll kill you, you piece of shit!

48:17.362 --> 48:19.626
- You two heard that, right?
-Sounded like Nolan.

48:19.731 --> 48:21.096
That was Nolan.

48:24.202 --> 48:26.193
What are you doing?

48:26.304 --> 48:27.430
I can't go.

48:29.240 --> 48:32.904
Listen, I want you two
to head east on the highway.

48:33.011 --> 48:34.501
stop anyone that comes. Anyone.

48:34.612 --> 48:35.943
What are you gonna do?

48:36.047 --> 48:37.537
I'm gonna go get Nolan,

48:37.649 --> 48:39.048
then I'm gonna find you two.

48:39.150 --> 48:41.585
Here, take this.

48:41.686 --> 48:43.780
And no matter what you hear,
you keep going, okay?

48:45.356 --> 48:46.323
Go!

48:52.897 --> 48:53.830
Fuck!

49:28.433 --> 49:29.366
Wait!

49:31.369 --> 49:34.634
Come on.
Remember, don't stop.

49:34.739 --> 49:36.764
But what if they got him?

49:39.310 --> 49:42.245
Just come on.
Let's keep going.

49:44.082 --> 49:45.550
Come on, baby.

51:29.887 --> 51:31.446
Why is this happening?

51:34.025 --> 51:35.652
Where is everyone'?

51:39.197 --> 51:40.665
I don't know, baby.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.971
Hey, look at me.

51:57.582 --> 51:58.981
It's going to be okay.

52:04.589 --> 52:07.183
- Okay?
-Promise?

52:09.761 --> 52:11.525
Have I ever lied to you?

52:13.698 --> 52:16.133
We'll get out of here, and...

52:16.234 --> 52:19.169
we'll be listening to wedding bells,

52:19.270 --> 52:20.965
before you can say when.

52:21.072 --> 52:22.562
When?

52:58.009 --> 53:01.104
Now, come on.
We have to keep moving.

53:52.029 --> 53:54.464
Nolan!

53:56.434 --> 53:57.367
Nolan.

53:59.804 --> 54:00.737
Shit

55:35.633 --> 55:37.032
Do you hear that?

55:41.872 --> 55:43.567
what are you talking about? locusts?

55:43.674 --> 55:44.835
No.

55:44.942 --> 55:46.501
Just listen. It's different.

55:50.181 --> 55:51.740
It sounds like a car.

55:58.589 --> 56:00.990
Well...

56:04.295 --> 56:06.024
Whatever it is,

56:06.130 --> 56:07.928
it's getting louder. Come on.

56:08.032 --> 56:09.500
Let's get off the road.

56:19.510 --> 56:21.035
Is it a car?

56:23.648 --> 56:25.343
I don't know. I can't see it.

56:28.119 --> 56:29.917
Oh, shit! It's the bikers!

56:30.021 --> 56:30.988
The bikers?

56:39.997 --> 56:41.465
alice.
what?

56:43.634 --> 56:45.102
This may be our only chance.

56:45.202 --> 56:46.636
Talking

56:48.205 --> 56:49.969
We've been walking for hours,

56:50.074 --> 56:53.169
-and we haven't seen anyone.
-So we'll find someone.

56:53.277 --> 56:56.770
But what if this is our only chance?

56:58.082 --> 57:00.574
You guys stuck guns in their faces.

57:01.819 --> 57:05.619
Yeah, but I can explain the situation.

57:05.723 --> 57:07.782
Tell 'em what happened to their friends.

57:07.892 --> 57:09.291
They're probably looking for 'em.

57:09.393 --> 57:10.554
<i>Dillon, no</i>

57:12.697 --> 57:14.961
babe, i got to..

57:20.137 --> 57:21.127
But...

57:22.740 --> 57:24.868
It's going to be okay.

57:25.009 --> 57:27.137
stay down.

58:10.488 --> 58:12.013
You guys have to help.

58:12.123 --> 58:13.056
Help?

58:13.157 --> 58:14.318
Just let me explain.

58:30.174 --> 58:32.165
I told you we'd get you.

58:32.276 --> 58:35.769
Wait. Just let me explain.

58:35.880 --> 58:38.781
There's a guy back there killing people.

58:38.883 --> 58:40.874
A guy. huh?

58:40.985 --> 58:42.510
Yeah, a big motherfucker.

58:42.620 --> 58:44.179
He killed your friends.

58:45.823 --> 58:47.086
Game again

58:47.191 --> 58:48.681
Your friends are dead.

58:51.195 --> 58:52.959
What about my wagon?

58:54.298 --> 58:56.665
-What?
-My wagon!

58:59.470 --> 59:01.404
Ah, it's back at this place.

59:01.505 --> 59:03.496
Place? Come on, what place?

59:04.542 --> 59:06.874
There's this place.
We stopped. There's a tourist...

59:06.977 --> 59:09.469
There's this town or something.

59:09.580 --> 59:11.207
- Where?
-lt's back there!

59:11.315 --> 59:15.912
We stopped, and all this weird shit
started happening.

59:16.020 --> 59:17.681
So your friends have my wagon?

59:19.023 --> 59:20.184
No!

59:20.291 --> 59:24.319
Your guys stopped,
and this big guy, he killed 'em.

59:29.800 --> 59:31.234
Where are your friends?

59:31.335 --> 59:33.269
They're back at this place!

59:33.370 --> 59:35.099
And how did you get here?

59:38.542 --> 59:39.805
I walked

59:44.949 --> 59:48.351
Listen, we need to get
the sheriff or something.

59:48.452 --> 59:51.114
So you're trying to tell me
that Victor and Rev are dead,

59:51.222 --> 59:56.160
and your friends are holed up at this
tourist place-y thing-y with my wagon.

59:56.260 --> 59:57.193
Is that right?

59:57.328 --> 59:59.353
Yeah, but it's not what...

59:59.463 --> 01:00:01.522
- What? Not what?
-Not just them!

01:00:01.632 --> 01:00:04.499
Oh, yeah. A big guy killed
Victor and Rev. Got it.

01:00:04.602 --> 01:00:05.694
Yes!

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.940
You're telling me the truth?

01:00:12.042 --> 01:00:13.009
Yes!

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:22.376
<i>Come here.
Come here.</i>

01:00:38.736 --> 01:00:42.570
Oh, yeah.
There is one thing, though.

01:00:42.673 --> 01:00:44.300
What's that?

01:00:52.349 --> 01:00:54.977
Nobody sticks a gun in my face.

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:11.159
Dillon!

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:16.030
Whoa, shit!

01:03:57.101 --> 01:03:59.126
it's gonna be okay, baby.

01:04:11.281 --> 01:04:14.307
- Just go.
-l'm not leaving you.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:20.847
No. No. You promised.

01:04:25.395 --> 01:04:26.885
it's... it's okay.

01:04:31.435 --> 01:04:34.234
- I love you, Alice.
-I love you.

01:04:34.338 --> 01:04:36.136
- Now go.
-No.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:51.214
You remember the wedding bells?

01:04:53.357 --> 01:04:55.257
You were going to be my husband,

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:57.293
so you can't leave me.

01:05:14.478 --> 01:05:16.310
Just go. Now Go.

01:05:18.749 --> 01:05:20.547
Don't leave me.

01:05:21.652 --> 01:05:23.313
Please.

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:34.380
Yes!

01:06:47.938 --> 01:06:49.463
Come on.

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:52.406
Come on. Oh! Damn it! Come on.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:55.001
Come on.
Stay there, stay there, stay there.

01:07:00.517 --> 01:07:02.076
I've been looking for those.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.728
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:17.857
Come on!

01:08:18.028 --> 01:08:19.120
<i>Hey! -</i>

01:08:28.872 --> 01:08:30.430
Wrong room.

01:10:21.585 --> 01:10:23.781
Alice..

01:10:27.190 --> 01:10:28.885
Don't worry.
I'm gonna get you out.

01:10:31.061 --> 01:10:32.085
Bleeding

01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:35.631
Where's Dillon?

01:10:39.703 --> 01:10:40.761
Nolan?

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:47.374
We're getting the fuck out.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:24.771
Stay here.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.166
come on..

01:12:45.195 --> 01:12:47.061
come on..

01:13:05.515 --> 01:13:08.075
Alice, it's getting dark.
We need to make it to the highway.

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:23.456
Alice!

01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:36.571
Alice, I need you
to stay with me, okay?

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:44.121
<i>Hey . Hey -.</i>

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:45.710
We made it this far, okay?

01:14:03.406 --> 01:14:04.965
Here, come on.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.839
We're gonna make it, okay?

01:15:41.938 --> 01:15:43.235
Try to keep that tight.

01:15:45.175 --> 01:15:47.041
I'm so thirsty.

01:15:47.143 --> 01:15:48.611
It's the blood loss.

01:15:49.813 --> 01:15:51.440
You can rest,
just don't fall asleep.

01:16:01.724 --> 01:16:03.317
What do you think they are?

01:16:07.931 --> 01:16:08.921
I have no idea.

01:16:10.033 --> 01:16:11.797
Why would they kill Nolan?

01:16:24.481 --> 01:16:25.915
In the war...

01:16:28.218 --> 01:16:29.617
I saw things.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:36.054
Things I never thought I'd see.

01:16:40.964 --> 01:16:43.228
Things a man can do
to another man.

01:16:56.312 --> 01:16:57.507
it's all right

01:17:13.563 --> 01:17:15.156
CSM Robart

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:19.459
PFC Reynolds, myself, and two others

01:17:19.569 --> 01:17:21.128
were on a small recon mission.

01:17:22.372 --> 01:17:25.501
We came across this village
after Charlie had been there.

01:17:32.115 --> 01:17:35.107
The things...
things they did to those people.

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:39.150
That feeling...

01:17:41.424 --> 01:17:43.859
That barn had the same feeling.

01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:45.189
what are you talking about?

01:17:46.496 --> 01:17:47.588
Death.

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:52.525
After a while, you just get used to it.

01:17:57.273 --> 01:17:58.900
Walked by dozens of bodies

01:18:01.945 --> 01:18:03.845
Some with faces and some without.

01:18:05.448 --> 01:18:08.383
And that's how it was
most of the time I was down there.

01:18:09.953 --> 01:18:11.785
I can't believe Dillon's gone.

01:18:19.262 --> 01:18:20.696
I know.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:28.602
We had planned on
getting married last year.

01:18:31.407 --> 01:18:34.433
He was so excited
when he heard you were coming home.

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:37.371
He wanted to wait.

01:18:41.818 --> 01:18:44.651
When you left, we weren't sure
you were coming back.

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.583
I'm sorry, Alice, I didn't know that.

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.058
I know.

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.624
I promise you this, though.

01:18:58.267 --> 01:19:01.464
When we get out of here, we're gonna
blow the lid off of this place.

01:19:05.608 --> 01:19:07.474
His death won't be in vain, okay?

01:19:09.012 --> 01:19:10.878
These crazy fucks will pay.

01:20:01.264 --> 01:20:02.595
Come on. I got you.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:17.512
Look.

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.274
There's a town.

01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:25.920
All right, come on.

01:20:26.022 --> 01:20:27.547
Be careful.

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:15.332
Look. They're back.

01:21:19.208 --> 01:21:21.199
Help!

01:21:21.310 --> 01:21:23.301
help us!

01:21:23.412 --> 01:21:25.312
Anyone?

01:21:27.683 --> 01:21:29.082
Help!

01:21:52.942 --> 01:21:53.875
Hey!

01:21:56.212 --> 01:21:57.373
Hey, mister!

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:01.549
- We really need your help.
-Alice, get back!

01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:22.895
<i>Alice</i>

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.472
Alice, you head north,
you gotta come across the highway.

01:22:26.576 --> 01:22:28.305
What are you saying?

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:30.277
I'm staying behind.
-I'm staying with you.

01:22:32.849 --> 01:22:34.977
Listen, I can handle it.
You go. Find somebody. Anybody.

01:22:35.084 --> 01:22:37.178
- We can go together.
-No, there's no time.

01:22:37.286 --> 01:22:38.378
- Just go!
-I can't!

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.216
You have to! Go!

01:22:40.323 --> 01:22:41.484
Go now!

01:22:45.027 --> 01:22:47.496
And no matter what you hear,
you keep going, all right?

01:22:47.597 --> 01:22:48.587
Go!

01:26:52.274 --> 01:26:53.708
Oh, shit!

01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:54.055
What do you think we should do, man?

01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:56.284
I don't know, man.
There's a town over there.

01:29:57.305 --> 01:30:03.328
