WEBVTT

00:03.460 --> 00:04.525
Ugh!

00:04.594 --> 00:06.227
This Thanksgiving is gonna be the worst!

00:06.296 --> 00:07.296
You don't know that.

00:07.364 --> 00:09.230
The years my dad comes are great,

00:09.299 --> 00:11.232
and my mom years are disasters.

00:11.301 --> 00:13.167
You should really try to appreciate
the time you have with your mom.

00:13.236 --> 00:14.902
Spoken like a man who drove his mother

00:14.971 --> 00:16.604
all the way to Oregon and enjoyed it.

00:16.673 --> 00:18.139
Well, our book club had just ended,

00:18.208 --> 00:19.474
and the last three books were
set in the Pacific Northwest.

00:19.542 --> 00:20.475
It just made sense.

00:21.611 --> 00:23.344
I just want a peaceful Thanksgiving.

00:23.413 --> 00:25.313
I have nothing to be thankful for!

00:25.382 --> 00:27.582
Your three beautiful children
are right here.

00:34.391 --> 00:36.451
<i>Called to school by Dr. Ellie...</i>

00:36.476 --> 00:38.926
<i>great Special Ed teacher,
terrible necklace-chooser.</i>

00:38.995 --> 00:40.428
Anna-Kat's behavior has been

00:40.497 --> 00:42.563
a little heightened lately.

00:42.632 --> 00:45.833
She organized the
stuffed animals by fur color.

00:47.270 --> 00:48.469
Looks a little race-war-y.

00:48.538 --> 00:50.638
Is anything going on at home?

00:50.707 --> 00:51.773
Any changes?

00:51.841 --> 00:54.575
Well, her favorite toy pony, Frenchie...

00:54.644 --> 00:56.944
Oh, I know about Frenchie's leg. Mm.

00:57.013 --> 00:59.280
Anything else out of the ordinary?

00:59.349 --> 01:02.183
Uh, the holidays
can be stressful for parents,

01:02.252 --> 01:05.119
and sensitive kids can pick up on that.

01:05.188 --> 01:07.355
My mother.

01:07.424 --> 01:08.790
She's coming for Thanksgiving.

01:08.858 --> 01:10.058
Ahh.

01:10.126 --> 01:11.893
I-Is that complicated for you?

01:11.961 --> 01:13.294
No. It's pretty simple.

01:13.363 --> 01:14.595
She's the worst.

01:14.664 --> 01:17.198
My mom's the biggest narcissist
on the planet.

01:17.267 --> 01:18.347
She was a Pan Am stewardess

01:18.401 --> 01:19.867
back in the day when it meant something.

01:19.936 --> 01:22.537
But was she there for me growing up? No.

01:22.605 --> 01:24.038
She traveled around the world.

01:24.107 --> 01:25.373
Well, Anna-Kat is...

01:25.442 --> 01:27.075
Did she come to
one of my basketball games?

01:27.143 --> 01:28.276
No.

01:28.344 --> 01:30.478
Was she at my back-to-school night? No.

01:30.547 --> 01:33.748
Did she ever check out
my break-dancing crew?

01:33.817 --> 01:34.949
Never!

01:35.018 --> 01:37.852
All she does is come around
and expect everybody

01:37.921 --> 01:41.189
to fawn all over her and listen
to her talk about herself.

01:41.257 --> 01:43.324
Unh-unh. Not in my house.

01:43.393 --> 01:46.728
She was not there for me,
and I am not gonna...

01:46.796 --> 01:49.130
Do you... Do you have a pillow?

01:49.199 --> 01:51.399
We're actually here
to talk about Anna-Kat.

01:51.468 --> 01:54.969
And right now, she is
feeding off of your anxiety.

01:55.038 --> 01:58.606
Uh, I wondered if you'd given
any more thought

01:58.675 --> 02:00.374
to putting her on medication.

02:00.443 --> 02:02.977
Dr. Ellie, you know
where I stand with this.

02:03.046 --> 02:04.312
She is 6 years old.

02:04.380 --> 02:05.747
I don't think screwing around
with her brain this young

02:05.815 --> 02:07.482
is a good idea.

02:07.550 --> 02:08.816
We'll revisit this

02:08.884 --> 02:11.819
if I find a bag of cat heads
in her backpack.

02:13.490 --> 02:16.424
Dr. Ellie says Anna-Kat
is feeding off my anxiety.

02:16.493 --> 02:18.226
She brought up the medication again.

02:18.294 --> 02:20.027
I like how she's not afraid of you.

02:20.096 --> 02:23.464
So, instead, she taught me
a few coping techniques for her.

02:23.533 --> 02:25.199
She can either squeeze a stress ball

02:25.268 --> 02:26.534
or sing a song in her head.

02:26.603 --> 02:28.436
But I don't want to open
the door to "Frozen" again,

02:28.505 --> 02:30.305
- so I just gave her the ball.
- Here's an idea...

02:30.340 --> 02:31.820
don't let your mother stress you out.

02:31.875 --> 02:33.708
This is not me. This is all her.

02:33.777 --> 02:35.376
No matter what the occasion,

02:35.445 --> 02:37.512
the attention always has to be on her.

02:37.580 --> 02:40.081
♪ Silent Night ♪

02:40.150 --> 02:43.451

03:09.212 --> 03:11.813
Oh! Wasn't I fabulous?

03:11.881 --> 03:13.681
That was me in my prime.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.550
But no reason to be jealous!

03:15.618 --> 03:17.919
I have one for each of you.

03:17.987 --> 03:19.854
All right. You're welcome.

03:21.057 --> 03:22.057
Ow!

03:22.125 --> 03:24.192
It hurts so much!

03:24.260 --> 03:26.694
Every time I bend my elbow,

03:26.763 --> 03:28.163
it makes this weird clicking noise.

03:28.198 --> 03:30.031
Is... Is that something
I should be worried about?

03:30.099 --> 03:31.099
Can you hear it?

03:32.235 --> 03:33.501
All that may be true,

03:33.570 --> 03:35.937
but maybe the bigger problem
is how you react.

03:36.005 --> 03:39.407
♪ Sleep in heavenly pe... ♪

03:39.475 --> 03:41.542
Sit down!

03:41.611 --> 03:43.644
Jesus does not want you
singing about him!

03:43.713 --> 03:47.014
No... body... wants... these!

03:47.083 --> 03:48.349
Get this thing out!

03:48.418 --> 03:49.851
It's not quite time to push.

03:49.919 --> 03:52.720
I mean my mother!

03:52.789 --> 03:56.757
Greg, she forced you
to walk her to her car.

03:56.826 --> 03:58.306
You missed the birth of our firstborn.

03:58.361 --> 04:00.663
I did, but I saw the sheets. I'm good.

04:00.741 --> 04:03.085
All that wouldn't have happened if you
didn't let her get under your skin.

04:03.172 --> 04:04.932
You're right. She's driving me crazy.

04:05.001 --> 04:06.734
And I'm driving Anna-Kat crazy.

04:06.803 --> 04:08.936
Next thing you know, we've got
a backpack full of cat heads.

04:09.005 --> 04:10.338
- What?
- It's a medical term.

04:10.406 --> 04:11.939
No matter what my mother does,

04:12.008 --> 04:13.965
I'm going to ignore her and stay calm.

04:13.990 --> 04:16.344
Or you can sit down and
finally tell her how you feel.

04:16.411 --> 04:17.612
God, no.

04:17.637 --> 04:19.437
I'm saving that stuff
to say to her coffin.

04:21.817 --> 04:24.085
Angela, I really need you
for Thanksgiving

04:24.153 --> 04:25.653
to be a buffer for my mom.

04:25.722 --> 04:27.488
Mnh-mnh. Too late.
I'm already Doris' buffer.

04:27.557 --> 04:28.689
Ugh.

04:28.758 --> 04:29.881
My parents are so grateful

04:29.906 --> 04:31.695
for all the money I give them
on Thanksgiving.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.195
- It's disgusting.
- I really need a buffer!

04:34.264 --> 04:35.196
Hi, everybody!

04:35.265 --> 04:37.131
- Hey.
- Hi, Viv.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.466
Oh, my gosh!

04:38.534 --> 04:40.101
That cheeseburger is huge.

04:40.169 --> 04:41.702
It's just the size that it comes as.

04:41.771 --> 04:44.238
It's enormous.

04:44.307 --> 04:46.007
It's a normal-sized cheeseburger, Viv.

04:46.075 --> 04:47.315
I love cheeseburgers.

04:47.377 --> 04:48.542
I eat them all the time.

04:48.611 --> 04:50.144
Sure you do.

04:50.213 --> 04:51.612
Yeah, we completely believe

04:51.681 --> 04:53.614
that you eat cheeseburgers all the time.

04:53.683 --> 04:55.583
Look at me! I'm taking a bite!

04:55.652 --> 04:57.318
That's my food.

04:57.387 --> 04:59.430
- Mmm! So good.
- Okay.

04:59.455 --> 05:02.828
So, um, are you guys gonna be
home or away for Thanksgiving?

05:02.853 --> 05:03.824
Home.

05:03.849 --> 05:06.469
Allen is gonna be in the city
with the boys and his ex-wife.

05:06.494 --> 05:08.696
They still do holidays
and vacations together.

05:08.765 --> 05:11.281
- Don't you go, too?
- Mnh-mnh. His ex-wife hates me.

05:11.401 --> 05:14.023
- Mm.
- Hates me. Hates me.

05:14.219 --> 05:15.770
She thinks I stole her husband.

05:15.838 --> 05:17.405
Which I kind of did.

05:17.473 --> 05:18.973
But not on purpose.

05:19.042 --> 05:21.342
You realize that's not a good
story to tell people, right?

05:21.411 --> 05:22.411
I know!

05:22.478 --> 05:24.679
So, I'm gonna be all alone.

05:24.747 --> 05:26.647
- Mm.
- By myself.

05:26.716 --> 05:28.616
- Yeah.
- On Thanksgiving.

05:30.019 --> 05:31.285
This coming Thursday.

05:33.423 --> 05:35.856
Well, enjoy the peace and quiet.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.726
I will!

05:38.795 --> 05:40.394
Okay!

05:40.463 --> 05:41.862
- Bye!
- Bye.

05:41.931 --> 05:44.131
<i>No way. My mom will already be
on my last nerve.</i>

05:44.200 --> 05:45.833
<i>I don't want Viv getting on nerves</i>

05:45.902 --> 05:47.201
<i>I haven't even discovered yet.</i>

05:47.270 --> 05:48.769
Touchdown!

05:48.838 --> 05:51.179
That's another 5 bucks you owe me.

05:51.249 --> 05:52.835
Guys, this is
my teaching assistant, Vali.

05:52.890 --> 05:54.175
Vali, these are my kids...

05:54.243 --> 05:55.676
Oliver, Taylor, and Anna-Kat.

05:55.745 --> 05:57.411
The boy seems shorter than I imagined.

05:57.480 --> 05:58.480
TV off, guys.

05:58.548 --> 05:59.580
But we have a bet on the game.

05:59.649 --> 06:01.215
Thanksgiving isn't about football.

06:01.284 --> 06:02.616
It pretty much is.

06:02.685 --> 06:04.885
It's only not when you have
a dad who isn't into sports.

06:04.921 --> 06:06.087
I'm into sports!

06:06.155 --> 06:08.022
Name three NFL quarterbacks.

06:09.625 --> 06:11.792
I don't have to prove
anything to you. TV off.

06:11.861 --> 06:13.928
Greg!

06:17.033 --> 06:18.280
You're killing me!

06:18.358 --> 06:20.483
Why do you always invite
one of your TAs?

06:20.554 --> 06:22.921
You mean invite someone from a
foreign land with nowhere to go

06:22.968 --> 06:24.638
to join us on a day
when we open our hearts?

06:24.707 --> 06:26.907
The last thing that I need...

06:26.976 --> 06:28.142
Hi!

06:28.211 --> 06:32.046
We are so happy that you are with us.

06:32.115 --> 06:33.414
I like your track suit.

06:33.483 --> 06:36.484
I must say, you are very beautiful.

06:36.552 --> 06:38.019
I like your size.

06:41.391 --> 06:43.090
Okay, that was creepy.

06:43.159 --> 06:45.259
It's no less creepy
than you hitting on my mom.

06:45.328 --> 06:46.694
I do not hit on your mom.

06:46.763 --> 06:48.195
You always kiss her on the cheek

06:48.264 --> 06:49.563
and try to make her like you.

06:49.632 --> 06:51.158
You're like, "Oh, that dress

06:51.221 --> 06:53.100
is just perfect for the season!"

06:53.169 --> 06:55.440
Why does your voice always get higher
when you do an impression of me?

06:56.511 --> 06:58.939
That's her. My heart is racing.

06:59.008 --> 07:00.474
I need that stress ball.

07:00.543 --> 07:01.876
You can do this.

07:01.944 --> 07:03.744
Stay calm.

07:03.813 --> 07:05.079
Don't let her get to you.

07:05.148 --> 07:08.149
Do it for Anna-Kat. Do it for me.

07:08.217 --> 07:10.151
Okay, I can see I lost you.
Do it for Anna-Kat.

07:10.219 --> 07:13.454
Okay.

07:17.160 --> 07:18.759
<i>Relax.</i>

07:18.828 --> 07:22.997
<i>There's no way she can make an entire
family Thanksgiving about herself.</i>

07:26.307 --> 07:28.235
<i>Oh, God. She upped her game.</i>

07:28.304 --> 07:29.869
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:41.584 --> 07:43.916
I'll just take this heavy
bag upstairs, then.

07:45.202 --> 07:47.788
- All by myself.
- Okay, great.

07:48.303 --> 07:49.974
Be careful of that clicky elbow.

07:51.025 --> 07:52.925
What happened to your mom?

07:52.994 --> 07:55.592
Absolutely nothing.

07:55.663 --> 07:56.996
She is looking for attention.

07:57.065 --> 07:59.832
You didn't ask?
She could be really hurt.

07:59.901 --> 08:00.967
Oh, please.

08:01.035 --> 08:02.568
That thing isn't even
bolted into her head.

08:02.637 --> 08:04.303
- I should go help her.
- No!

08:04.372 --> 08:06.138
You will be playing right into her hand.

08:06.207 --> 08:07.418
I'm a good person!

08:07.443 --> 08:09.141
You knew what you were getting
into when you married me.

08:09.210 --> 08:10.409
Okay, but no crawling up her butt.

08:10.478 --> 08:13.458
No, like, "Oh,
we're just so happy you're here!"

08:13.483 --> 08:15.948
- I don't sound like that.
- Dad, did you say something?

08:16.985 --> 08:18.651
All right.

08:20.928 --> 08:23.129
So. How was your trip?

08:23.154 --> 08:25.686
Not easy, as you can imagine.

08:26.811 --> 08:29.862
Anna-Kat and I saw a video of
this guy going through security

08:29.931 --> 08:33.566
who was caught smuggling
a monkey in his underpants.

08:33.635 --> 08:36.602
It was supposed to be sedated,
but it was awake.

08:36.671 --> 08:38.683
- And very angry.
- Mm.

08:39.374 --> 08:41.506
Well, uh, we're happy you're here.

08:43.977 --> 08:45.411
I...

08:45.480 --> 08:47.813
Check on the, uh, Thanksgiving.

08:53.354 --> 08:55.521
Just leave it.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.091
Grandma is known for pretending,

08:59.160 --> 09:01.160
so even though she looks hurt,

09:01.229 --> 09:04.163
remember the important thing
is that she's not hurt.

09:04.232 --> 09:06.532
So no one talk about the
monkey bars on Grandma's head.

09:06.601 --> 09:08.668
I love watching your mouth move.

09:08.736 --> 09:10.202
Dude.

09:11.472 --> 09:15.274
Anna-Kat, you don't need
to squeeze your stress ball.

09:15.343 --> 09:16.442
Mom is fine.

09:16.511 --> 09:18.778
We are like E.T. and Elliott.

09:18.846 --> 09:21.047
Whatever happens to one
happens to the other.

09:21.115 --> 09:23.115
Oh! You're like me.

09:23.184 --> 09:24.850
So you get a weird feeling in your tummy

09:24.919 --> 09:27.753
whenever you see a mommy
that's taller than a daddy.

09:27.822 --> 09:29.755
Totally.

09:29.824 --> 09:32.024
Can I steal you for a sec?

09:34.028 --> 09:35.261
I, uh...

09:35.330 --> 09:37.964
inadvertently lip-kissed your mom.

09:38.032 --> 09:39.465
Greg.

09:39.534 --> 09:40.566
I didn't enjoy it!

09:40.635 --> 09:42.034
Why do you even have to say that?

09:43.143 --> 09:45.591
There's no way everyone's
staying quiet about Grandma.

09:45.640 --> 09:46.672
You don't think so?

09:46.741 --> 09:48.407
Care to make it more interesting?

09:48.476 --> 09:50.476
I'll bet on it. It's on!

09:51.646 --> 09:53.346
When have I ever high-fived?

09:54.916 --> 09:56.515
You know, when I was a stewardess,

09:56.584 --> 09:59.385
before every flight,
I had to get on the scale.

09:59.454 --> 10:02.622
And if you weighed over 118,
they put you on diet pills

10:02.690 --> 10:04.423
and only let you fly
out of Jersey and Detroit.

10:04.492 --> 10:06.759
That's terrible.

10:06.828 --> 10:08.327
No, no, no.
It kept me looking fantastic.

10:08.396 --> 10:09.695
Mom! That's degrading.

10:10.765 --> 10:12.698
Mama, where's my stress ball?

10:12.767 --> 10:13.866
Oh.

10:13.935 --> 10:15.801
Honey, we'll find it.

10:15.870 --> 10:17.336
And I feel ya.

10:18.740 --> 10:20.906
What, so now she's using a stress ball?

10:20.975 --> 10:22.208
When the need arises.

10:24.602 --> 10:26.035
Knock, knock!

10:26.060 --> 10:27.413
Happy Thanksgiving!

10:27.482 --> 10:29.980
- Viv?
- So fun!

10:30.005 --> 10:32.318
Greg saw me through the window
and waved me in!

10:32.386 --> 10:33.819
Hi, everybody!

10:35.423 --> 10:37.957
Look at your table!

10:38.025 --> 10:39.425
Yeah.

10:39.494 --> 10:40.926
Oh! Wow. Are...

10:40.995 --> 10:43.462
Are these... from the street?

10:43.531 --> 10:45.164
You know what?

10:45.233 --> 10:46.599
You're lucky I'm here.

10:46.667 --> 10:49.034
I'm gonna let you use
my fall tablescape.

10:49.103 --> 10:50.770
There's nothing wrong
with my table, Viv.

10:52.173 --> 10:54.106
You are so funny!

10:54.175 --> 10:56.509
Greg!

10:57.912 --> 10:59.879
Hi. I'm Viv.

10:59.947 --> 11:01.480
It's so nice to meet you.

11:01.549 --> 11:03.382
You're too bony for me.

11:03.451 --> 11:05.733
I didn't think that you could do anything
worse than making out with my mom,

11:05.795 --> 11:07.353
but congratulations. You topped it!

11:07.388 --> 11:08.821
Well, she was desperately
peering through the window.

11:08.890 --> 11:09.989
What was I supposed to do?

11:10.058 --> 11:11.757
The same thing that you do
if someone asks

11:11.826 --> 11:13.893
if you have a minute
to save the environment...

11:13.961 --> 11:16.295
You look at your shoes
and you keep moving.

11:16.364 --> 11:17.863
Darling, you are stunning.

11:17.932 --> 11:19.398
Oh, those stems!

11:19.467 --> 11:20.866
Tell me... Were you ever a stewardess?

11:20.935 --> 11:23.570
Why, no, but thank you. I'm Viv!

11:23.638 --> 11:25.471
I'm Kathryn, Katie's mother.

11:26.841 --> 11:27.973
Kathryn, forgive me.

11:28.042 --> 11:29.335
I'm sure you've been
talking about this all day,

11:29.360 --> 11:31.610
but I have to ask...
What happened to you?

11:31.679 --> 11:33.612
<i>No-o-o-o-o!</i>

11:33.681 --> 11:35.241
Pay up, girl!

11:35.389 --> 11:37.516
Mom says you're not allowed
to call me that.

11:37.585 --> 11:40.086
Well, it all started three weeks ago

11:40.154 --> 11:43.589
when I got into a small
but very severe car accident.

11:43.658 --> 11:45.780
- Oh, my gosh.
- <i>What's the other thing</i>

11:45.851 --> 11:47.893
<i>Dr. Ellie told Anna-Kat to do
to stay calm?</i>

11:47.962 --> 11:49.795
<i>Oh, yes! Sing a song in your head!</i>

11:49.864 --> 11:52.331
<i>No! Not that song! Too late!</i>

11:52.400 --> 11:53.966
<i>♪ Don't let them in ♪</i>

11:54.035 --> 11:55.401
<i>♪ Don't let them see ♪</i>

11:55.470 --> 11:59.605
<i>♪ Be the good girl
you always have to be ♪</i>

11:59.674 --> 12:01.173
...stops. I hit him.

12:01.242 --> 12:02.908
- Oh!
- So I'm driving...

12:02.977 --> 12:06.612
♪ Conceal, don't feel,
don't let them know ♪

12:06.681 --> 12:09.515
♪ But now they know ♪

12:09.584 --> 12:10.983
What are you doing?

12:11.052 --> 12:12.918
We spent three years getting
that song out of this house.

12:12.987 --> 12:14.086
It's spilling out.

12:14.155 --> 12:15.588
♪ Let it go ♪

12:15.656 --> 12:16.522
♪ Let it go ♪

12:16.591 --> 12:17.591
Oh, dear Lord.

12:17.658 --> 12:19.525
♪ Can't hold it back anymore ♪

12:19.594 --> 12:21.505
Honey, you have got to calm down.

12:21.576 --> 12:23.400
Isn't it a good thing
your mom has someone to talk to?

12:23.431 --> 12:25.064
Now we've got
the neediest woman in the world

12:25.133 --> 12:27.433
coming together with the biggest
attention whore in the world,

12:27.502 --> 12:29.135
which is exactly
what I was trying to avoid.

12:29.203 --> 12:31.203
So, no! Not good!

12:31.272 --> 12:34.039
I'm gonna use a word... Selfless.

12:34.108 --> 12:37.009
You didn't want to ruin
their holiday by not showing up.

12:37.078 --> 12:38.911
I don't like to make things about me.

12:38.980 --> 12:40.946
You know, people think of me
as a giving person.

12:41.015 --> 12:42.181
Oh, I can't take it.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.649
I'm blowing the lid off
this web of lies.

12:43.718 --> 12:45.951
I'm gonna "Brady Bunch" her.

12:46.020 --> 12:48.420
You know I wasn't allowed
to watch television as a child.

12:48.489 --> 12:51.857
Well, this man blamed Carol for
injuring his neck in a car accident,

12:51.926 --> 12:53.325
and then Mike and the kids
went to court,

12:53.394 --> 12:54.660
and then Mike dropped a briefcase,

12:54.729 --> 12:56.495
which caused the man
with the fake neck brace

12:56.564 --> 12:58.097
to whip his head around,

12:58.166 --> 13:00.399
proving that his neck
wasn't hurt at all.

13:02.036 --> 13:04.537
The whole family went to court
for a traffic accident?

13:05.940 --> 13:07.992
The doctor was supposed
to be examining my neck,

13:08.047 --> 13:10.910
- but his eyes were journeying.
- It's quite a journey.

13:10.978 --> 13:12.978
Mama, I can't find my ball.

13:13.047 --> 13:14.780
Try to find anything else to squeeze.

13:14.849 --> 13:17.380
You know, I had him
on a flight once to JFK.

13:17.442 --> 13:18.497
No!

13:18.567 --> 13:20.319
He kept on pressing the help button.

13:20.388 --> 13:22.888
It was supposedly because he
didn't know how to work the...

13:27.271 --> 13:28.503
Damn it!

13:29.619 --> 13:31.352
I thought you said the "Brady Bunch" man

13:31.377 --> 13:32.274
dropped his briefcase,

13:32.299 --> 13:33.933
not his husband's spaghetti plate!

13:34.001 --> 13:34.934
Mom! You okay?

13:35.002 --> 13:36.702
Oh, she's fine.

13:36.771 --> 13:37.903
As I was saying...

13:37.972 --> 13:41.368
<i>♪ Let it go, let it go ♪</i>

13:41.393 --> 13:44.436
<i>♪ That perfect girl is gone ♪</i>

13:44.461 --> 13:45.675
...was fawning all over me.

13:45.746 --> 13:47.546
Anna-Kat.

13:48.382 --> 13:49.949
Grandma's talking.

13:50.017 --> 13:52.084
<i>♪ Here I stand ♪</i>

13:52.153 --> 13:57.937
<i>♪ In the light of day ♪</i>

13:58.007 --> 14:01.827
<i>♪ Let the storm rage o-o-o-on ♪</i>

14:01.896 --> 14:03.896
Anna-Kat, please!

14:03.965 --> 14:05.030
Isn't it about time

14:05.099 --> 14:06.999
that somebody put this kid
on medication?

14:07.068 --> 14:09.097
Medication?

14:09.198 --> 14:11.303
You want to put my daughter
on medication

14:11.372 --> 14:13.639
because she interrupted
your stupid story

14:13.708 --> 14:15.174
about a jungle gym on your head?!

14:15.243 --> 14:18.049
That's it! I'm taking it off!

14:18.713 --> 14:20.713
Aah!

14:20.781 --> 14:22.481
Ladies! Please, stop!

14:22.550 --> 14:25.217
Everyone else, there's spinach and
artichoke dip in a bread bowl.

14:25.286 --> 14:26.952
There's something about strong women

14:27.021 --> 14:28.220
that just gets me going.

14:28.712 --> 14:31.492
Again, that's my mother
and my grandmother.

14:31.517 --> 14:32.992
You're a lucky man.

14:34.128 --> 14:35.827
Oh, my God. I cupped your boob.

14:35.852 --> 14:38.597
- Attacked and fondled?
- Didn't fondle.

14:38.666 --> 14:39.965
Aye!

14:41.291 --> 14:42.578
The dip is delicious.

14:47.018 --> 14:49.647
Hey, Greg. How are you?

14:49.756 --> 14:51.621
How's your holiday going?

14:51.689 --> 14:54.557
Normally, I go upstairs and smooth
things over, but this time, I can't.

14:54.626 --> 14:55.925
Your mother would assume
I was there to bed her.

14:55.994 --> 14:57.293
Well, I'm not going up there.

14:57.362 --> 14:59.195
She was completely out of line
with Anna-Kat.

15:00.899 --> 15:02.398
I agree the timing was way off,

15:02.467 --> 15:04.167
but it really wasn't that terrible.

15:04.235 --> 15:06.469
It's not like Dr. Ellie
hasn't suggested medication

15:06.538 --> 15:07.538
for Anna-Kat before.

15:07.605 --> 15:09.572
I am not willing to go down that road

15:09.641 --> 15:12.041
until we've exhausted
all the other roads.

15:12.110 --> 15:13.476
I totally agree with you,

15:13.545 --> 15:15.945
but it's there for us
if we feel like she needs it.

15:16.014 --> 15:17.713
Because the singing in your head,

15:17.782 --> 15:19.882
from what we've seen today...
not effective.

15:19.951 --> 15:23.085
My mom just wants to drug Anna-Kat
so she doesn't have to deal with her.

15:23.154 --> 15:25.394
The same reason why she wanted
to fly around the world...

15:25.457 --> 15:27.089
so she didn't have to deal with me.

15:27.158 --> 15:28.891
Why are you telling me this?
You should be telling her.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.827
Greg! This is coffin talk.

15:30.895 --> 15:32.261
You know, you're critical of your mom,

15:32.330 --> 15:34.197
but you're the one who's
thinking of herself right now.

15:34.265 --> 15:35.198
You're acting just like her.

15:35.266 --> 15:37.133
So, this is it, Greg.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.936
This is where your life ends.

15:40.004 --> 15:42.738
Sweetheart, this is your chance

15:42.807 --> 15:44.474
to have a real conversation
with your mother.

15:44.499 --> 15:46.383
Fine.

15:46.555 --> 15:49.512
I've never been able
to get through to her.

15:50.094 --> 15:52.415
At least you know how to touch her.

15:54.919 --> 15:56.052
Hey.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.553
Everything okay?

15:57.622 --> 15:59.822
Oh, my God. So good!

15:59.891 --> 16:01.524
I know it's none of my business...

16:01.593 --> 16:02.959
<i>Here's where you stop talking.</i>

16:03.027 --> 16:05.051
- ...but if you want my opinion...
<i>- I don't.</i>

16:05.076 --> 16:07.917
...medication has done wonders
for my step-kids.

16:07.972 --> 16:09.933
- Viv, I am not gonna...
- I get it.

16:10.001 --> 16:12.339
I had my doubts about it going in, too.

16:12.401 --> 16:14.403
But those kids
were totally out of control,

16:14.472 --> 16:16.405
and once I started taking these,

16:16.474 --> 16:18.574
I found them much easier to handle.

16:18.643 --> 16:21.978
So, these pills help you smile
through the pain?

16:22.046 --> 16:24.347
I feel nothing.

16:24.415 --> 16:26.983
Mm.

16:28.620 --> 16:31.687
So, turns out Anna-Kat
doesn't need drugs...

16:31.756 --> 16:32.756
We do.

16:37.140 --> 16:39.228
Oh, I remember these.

16:40.742 --> 16:42.092
Can we go again?

16:42.117 --> 16:44.100
Sure. I'm happy to take
more of your money.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.568
Gambling's awesome.

16:45.637 --> 16:49.338
I think it's gonna be a problem
for me later in life.

16:49.407 --> 16:51.073
Whoo!

16:51.142 --> 16:52.375
I feel good.

16:52.443 --> 16:54.176
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

16:54.245 --> 16:57.013
Mom, all you do is try to get attention,

16:57.081 --> 16:59.148
and all I do is yell at you.

16:59.217 --> 17:01.250
We have got to figure out a way
to stop that.

17:01.319 --> 17:03.753
- Mm.
- I mean, come on, Mom.

17:03.821 --> 17:06.088
What is with this thing?

17:06.156 --> 17:07.656
Well, it's... it's from my car accident.

17:07.724 --> 17:09.525
I called you about it,
but you never followed up.

17:09.594 --> 17:11.359
Because you said it was nothing.

17:11.429 --> 17:14.205
When I hear the word
"nothing," I move on.

17:14.231 --> 17:15.231
Okay, can I just ask you...

17:15.300 --> 17:17.942
Why is it so hard for you
to be there for me?

17:18.471 --> 17:19.737
Seriously?

17:19.762 --> 17:21.503
When were you there for me?

17:21.573 --> 17:23.063
You picked a life
of travel and adventure

17:23.108 --> 17:24.874
over being there for your kids!

17:24.943 --> 17:27.209
I sound happy, but I'm very upset!

17:27.278 --> 17:29.412
Katie, I know
that I wasn't a good parent.

17:29.480 --> 17:31.514
You know, whatever that thing was

17:31.583 --> 17:33.282
that's supposed to kick in
just never kicked in.

17:33.351 --> 17:36.018
Well, maybe because
you were such a crappy mom,

17:36.087 --> 17:38.487
that's why I try so hard
to be a good mom.

17:38.556 --> 17:39.488
Oh!

17:39.557 --> 17:41.057
So I made you a good mom.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.792
Mnh-mnh. That's not what I'm saying.

17:42.860 --> 17:44.126
Not what I'm saying.

17:44.195 --> 17:46.362
And I'm sorry that I said that
about Anna-Kat.

17:46.431 --> 17:48.164
And I'm sorry

17:48.232 --> 17:50.666
that I missed so many things
when you were younger.

17:50.735 --> 17:52.639
- Mm.
- You know, like that weird, um,

17:52.709 --> 17:53.737
break-dancing thing.

17:53.738 --> 17:55.504
- Mm-hmm.
- It was always so important to you.

17:55.573 --> 17:56.773
Well, it's never too late, Mom.

17:56.808 --> 17:57.808
Okay?

17:57.875 --> 18:00.176
Okay.

18:00.244 --> 18:01.244
Unh!

18:01.279 --> 18:03.179
Unh-unh! Unh!

18:03.247 --> 18:04.413
Wow.

18:04.482 --> 18:06.415
Mm-mm-mm!

18:06.484 --> 18:07.864
That's something.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.444
All right, why don't you
help me get out of this thing,

18:11.489 --> 18:13.589
and then we can go downstairs
and enjoy ourselves

18:13.658 --> 18:15.808
before Viv's happy pills wear off?

18:15.833 --> 18:17.526
I mean, where did you get this thing?

18:17.595 --> 18:19.428
Oh, I visited Ruth Jackson in the home.

18:19.497 --> 18:21.046
- Mm-hmm.
- And this was in her closet.

18:21.071 --> 18:23.099
- Mm.
- That woman doesn't have a clue.

18:23.124 --> 18:25.201
- No.
- Half the time, she goes to lunch nude.

18:28.906 --> 18:31.073
Thank you for your gift earlier.

18:31.142 --> 18:32.719
- Oh!
- It did the job.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.221
I've got gobs of them.

18:36.581 --> 18:38.770
I'm really glad you came.

18:38.843 --> 18:39.742
<i>Wow.</i>

18:39.796 --> 18:41.129
<i>These pills are powerful.</i>

18:41.231 --> 18:42.383
- Hey, Katie.
- Mm-hmm?

18:42.446 --> 18:44.516
Why don't you sit
your bottom here, next to me?

18:44.579 --> 18:46.086
Oh, Vali, I think I'm going to go ahead

18:46.111 --> 18:48.157
and probably sit next to anyone else.

18:48.233 --> 18:49.465
Fair enough.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.215
- I'll sit there.
- Okay.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.896
Mom.

18:53.965 --> 18:55.731
Do you want to go ahead
and sit next to me?

18:55.800 --> 18:57.566
Oh!

18:57.635 --> 19:00.169
I would love that.

19:01.572 --> 19:05.174
Hey, I'm sorry things
got awkward with us today.

19:05.243 --> 19:06.442
Let's just start over.

19:06.511 --> 19:08.210
Happy Thanksgiving, Greg.

19:08.279 --> 19:10.112
Oh, happy Thanksgiving.

19:11.816 --> 19:13.683
You... You just unhooked my bra.

19:15.520 --> 19:17.853
That's not even a thing
I can do if I'm trying!

19:17.922 --> 19:19.010
Oh, Greg.

19:22.332 --> 19:23.397
The one time a year

19:23.467 --> 19:25.199
we get little marshmallows
on sweet potatoes,

19:25.262 --> 19:27.369
and you're too high
to put them on the table.

19:27.438 --> 19:29.240
I made a lot of bad decisions yesterday.

19:29.310 --> 19:31.576
You're telling me.
You left the oven on all night long.

19:31.625 --> 19:32.791
You could have burned down the house.

19:32.860 --> 19:33.993
I also left the sink on.

19:34.061 --> 19:35.621
It would have put out part of the fire.

19:36.364 --> 19:39.398
Oh.

19:39.467 --> 19:41.266
No!

19:41.335 --> 19:42.768
No, no, no, no, no!

19:42.837 --> 19:43.869
What?

19:43.938 --> 19:46.638
Apparently, I also agreed to make

19:46.707 --> 19:49.242
an "Amazing Race"
audition video with my mom.

19:49.267 --> 19:50.809
Always say no to drugs, Katie.

19:50.878 --> 19:52.011
She wrote a script.

19:52.079 --> 19:54.179
She wants me to buy a purple tank top.

19:54.248 --> 19:56.216
- She is bananas!
- Hey.

20:03.286 --> 20:04.556
Honey.

20:04.965 --> 20:06.592
Mama's sorry.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.403
I know all this affects you,

20:08.489 --> 20:09.995
and I don't want to drive you crazy

20:10.064 --> 20:11.872
like my mom did with me.

20:12.329 --> 20:14.454
- So...
- Were you saying something?

20:14.525 --> 20:16.068
Oh. Yeah.

20:16.137 --> 20:17.436
Did you not hear me?

20:18.655 --> 20:20.827
Well, I just thought you were doing
all this lining-up business

20:20.851 --> 20:23.404
because you heard Mommy
getting crazy about Grandma's stuff.

20:24.062 --> 20:26.135
No, Mama. Don't worry about it.

20:26.207 --> 20:27.604
I've got my own crap.
