WEBVTT

00:03.775 --> 00:06.244
Ants on a log. You'll love 'em.

00:06.486 --> 00:08.329
Hey, I'm not eating ants.

00:08.571 --> 00:09.882
Not real ants, duh.

00:09.906 --> 00:11.541
Raisins and peanut
butter and celery.

00:12.033 --> 00:13.376
It's my best dish...

00:13.451 --> 00:14.345
I think.

00:14.369 --> 00:15.586
You'll see.

00:19.666 --> 00:22.427
Hey, crank it up. People in
Sausalito can't hear it.

00:25.630 --> 00:27.473
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

00:28.299 --> 00:29.600
Charlie!

00:29.634 --> 00:30.935
God!

00:32.052 --> 00:33.604
- Jeez...
- Charlie, get out of here!

00:33.805 --> 00:35.408
You can't just come busting
in my room like that!

00:35.432 --> 00:37.317
Claudia's downstairs,
for God's sakes.

00:37.350 --> 00:39.495
Claudia's downstairs all the
time when you and Kirsten do it.

00:39.519 --> 00:41.330
- That's not the same thing.
- That's exactly the same.

00:41.354 --> 00:43.040
Claudia's downstairs,
you're 16 years old,

00:43.064 --> 00:44.458
and you're not having
sex in this house.

00:44.482 --> 00:45.835
You had sex in this
house when you were 16.

00:45.859 --> 00:46.752
No, I didn't!

00:46.776 --> 00:48.379
Mom and Dad made it
impossible for me,

00:48.403 --> 00:49.630
I'm gonna make it
impossible for you.

00:49.654 --> 00:50.872
Oh, like that's fair.

00:53.324 --> 00:54.677
Close your eyes and
stick out your tongue.

00:54.701 --> 00:56.303
Ants on a log. Here you go.

00:56.327 --> 00:58.463
Claud, let's, um, eat them
in the kitchen, okay?

00:59.289 --> 01:00.590
Okay.

01:02.876 --> 01:04.302
You happy?

01:04.419 --> 01:05.762
Wow...

01:06.004 --> 01:08.389
must be cool to have a
cop for a big brother.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.817
Hey, Jill, this
isn't your place.

01:09.841 --> 01:11.027
When you go to someone
else's place,

01:11.051 --> 01:11.944
they've got rules.

01:11.968 --> 01:13.279
Charlie, I always
thought you were cool.

01:13.303 --> 01:14.947
Isn't that what you're
always saying, Bailey?

01:14.971 --> 01:16.647
"How cool Charlie is?"

01:19.976 --> 01:20.995
I found some raisins,

01:21.019 --> 01:23.154
but I had to dig them
out of the Raisin Bran.

01:24.314 --> 01:25.782
You want an ants on a log?

01:25.982 --> 01:27.200
Um...

01:29.027 --> 01:30.787
Uh, I'm leaving.

01:31.362 --> 01:33.007
I'm leaving, okay?
I get the message.

01:33.031 --> 01:34.499
You don't have to tell me twice.

01:35.283 --> 01:36.709
Earthquake!

02:33.550 --> 02:34.684
Everybody okay?

02:36.678 --> 02:37.937
Yeah.

02:39.430 --> 02:40.773
Bill? Owen?

02:40.807 --> 02:42.525
Yeah, right here.

02:43.309 --> 02:44.735
Owen's having a big time.

02:45.562 --> 02:46.455
Good.

02:46.479 --> 02:48.948
What do you think? 4.6?

02:49.649 --> 02:51.576
Probably 4.0.

02:52.360 --> 02:54.129
I think it's safe to come
out of the doorway now.

02:54.153 --> 02:55.913
What if there's an aftershock?

02:56.364 --> 02:57.299
Aftershock?

02:57.323 --> 02:58.509
It's okay.

02:58.533 --> 02:59.969
I mean, everything
is still shaking.

02:59.993 --> 03:01.262
Can't you see it shaking?

03:01.286 --> 03:03.546
It's you. You're shaking.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.890
Do you guys remember
that one in '89

03:04.914 --> 03:06.851
when we all thought
we were okay?

03:06.875 --> 03:08.394
And then that aftershock hit.

03:08.418 --> 03:09.645
And our chimney

03:09.669 --> 03:11.230
crashed right
through our ceiling

03:11.254 --> 03:12.231
in our living room,

03:12.255 --> 03:13.691
and it smashed our stereo.

03:13.715 --> 03:15.025
I got the CD out though and...

03:15.049 --> 03:15.985
And it just...

03:16.009 --> 03:16.986
It just wouldn't play anymore.

03:17.010 --> 03:18.237
It just kept making
this blipping noise,

03:18.261 --> 03:19.196
like, blip, blip, blip...

03:19.220 --> 03:20.322
Bay...

03:20.346 --> 03:21.949
Maybe you should
take her home now.

03:21.973 --> 03:23.325
Yeah, okay.

03:23.349 --> 03:24.734
Come on, it's okay.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.194
Come on.

03:26.477 --> 03:27.945
Through the ceiling?

03:29.689 --> 03:31.750
Peter, I need to move the table.

03:31.774 --> 03:33.168
Can you help me?

03:33.192 --> 03:34.660
Yeah, just a sec.

03:37.238 --> 03:38.456
Sure you don't want anything?

03:44.495 --> 03:46.255
Come on, it's just a tremor.

03:46.497 --> 03:47.725
My heart's still racing.

03:47.749 --> 03:49.425
My hands are all clammy.

03:52.086 --> 03:54.597
Mmm. Not so clammy to me.

03:54.672 --> 03:55.774
Justin...

03:55.798 --> 03:56.933
What?

03:57.217 --> 03:58.611
I think we should go back

03:58.635 --> 04:00.811
to thinking of each
other as friends.

04:02.764 --> 04:03.940
Oh.

04:04.724 --> 04:06.275
Well, I don't know
if I can do that.

04:06.893 --> 04:08.361
Besides, I don't
know if I want to.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.989
I mean, that kiss...

04:12.023 --> 04:14.325
We should just pretend
it never happened.

04:15.652 --> 04:16.545
I mean,

04:16.569 --> 04:18.120
it can only get us in trouble.

04:18.196 --> 04:19.579
Was it horrible?

04:19.613 --> 04:21.091
I mean, the kiss, was it just...

04:21.115 --> 04:22.458
No. No.

04:23.660 --> 04:25.211
No, it was...

04:26.996 --> 04:28.599
That's not the point.

04:28.623 --> 04:29.840
Libby is the point.

04:31.084 --> 04:32.426
Right, Libby.

04:34.462 --> 04:36.556
Well, I keep thinking about you.

04:39.092 --> 04:40.685
Do you think about me?

04:41.719 --> 04:43.187
Hey, you guys.

04:43.471 --> 04:45.824
What do you think, 4.6?

04:45.848 --> 04:47.701
I was on Chestnut
Street at the printers,

04:47.725 --> 04:49.944
and all these car alarms
started shrieking.

04:54.649 --> 04:55.992
So what'd I miss?

04:59.612 --> 05:01.455
Phew! 4.0?

05:01.656 --> 05:02.999
4.6.

05:04.367 --> 05:06.262
Oh, um, before I forget,

05:06.286 --> 05:08.555
that woman called
again, Gwen somebody.

05:08.579 --> 05:10.172
She said you hadn't
called her back.

05:11.207 --> 05:12.550
Who is she anyway?

05:12.667 --> 05:15.104
Oh, just somebody
from design class.

05:15.128 --> 05:16.313
It's not important.

05:16.337 --> 05:19.483
Wow, Mr. Happy lost his head.

05:19.507 --> 05:21.068
It sounded important.

05:21.092 --> 05:23.102
She said she wants to
know your decision.

05:26.764 --> 05:28.774
Well, then I'll just
assume the worst.

05:29.100 --> 05:30.776
She's pregnant with your child.

05:33.396 --> 05:35.031
She's a furniture designer.

05:35.440 --> 05:36.782
A really good one.

05:36.941 --> 05:38.419
Anyway, we got to
talking after class,

05:38.443 --> 05:39.920
and she saw some of the sketches

05:39.944 --> 05:41.495
that I'd done for Curran,

05:42.071 --> 05:43.382
and she kind of flipped.

05:43.406 --> 05:46.176
Turns out she's starting
her own business

05:46.200 --> 05:47.626
and wants me to be her partner.

05:47.702 --> 05:49.587
That's why she's been calling.

05:50.329 --> 05:52.381
But it's not gonna work out.

05:52.415 --> 05:54.101
But you haven't called her back,

05:54.125 --> 05:56.469
so you're still
thinking it might.

05:59.422 --> 06:01.807
Great. I had to get involved
with a psychology major.

06:01.966 --> 06:03.726
So it must be a
good opportunity.

06:05.136 --> 06:06.312
Wow.

06:06.471 --> 06:07.823
These are her designs?

06:07.847 --> 06:08.741
Yeah.

06:08.765 --> 06:09.658
It's just...

06:09.682 --> 06:11.660
she needs me to kick in
half the start-up costs.

06:11.684 --> 06:13.245
Seven thousand dollars,
which I don't have.

06:13.269 --> 06:14.329
Well, you could
get it somewhere.

06:14.353 --> 06:15.488
Like where?

06:15.897 --> 06:16.957
I can't use family money,

06:16.981 --> 06:19.126
because I already lost
$12,000 in a bad investment,

06:19.150 --> 06:20.377
and I can't go to the bank

06:20.401 --> 06:22.004
because I don't exactly have
a great credit rating...

06:22.028 --> 06:23.162
You could ask me.

06:23.780 --> 06:25.674
I mean, my grandma left
me some when she died.

06:25.698 --> 06:26.717
It's not like I'm rich,

06:26.741 --> 06:28.751
but I could loan you the $7,000.

06:29.035 --> 06:32.004
Well, thanks anyway, but I...

06:32.747 --> 06:34.090
I don't want that
responsibility.

06:34.457 --> 06:36.717
Charlie, why miss out on this?

06:36.793 --> 06:38.344
I have the money, just take it.

06:44.717 --> 06:46.352
It says here it was a 5.1.

06:47.178 --> 06:49.031
Everybody tried to tell
me it was in the fours,

06:49.055 --> 06:51.273
but I knew it was bigger.

06:51.599 --> 06:53.077
Well, I don't mind
the little ones

06:53.101 --> 06:54.328
as long as they relieve pressure

06:54.352 --> 06:55.486
on the fault lines.

06:55.645 --> 06:57.748
Not to shatter your belief
system or anything,

06:57.772 --> 07:00.783
but the seismologist lady
on TV said that's a myth.

07:01.776 --> 07:02.711
Excuse me.

07:02.735 --> 07:03.754
We got to get to school.

07:03.778 --> 07:05.631
About the... About the fridge?

07:05.655 --> 07:07.007
Oh, right.

07:07.031 --> 07:08.707
Power surge fried your motor.

07:08.991 --> 07:10.052
From the earthquake?

07:10.076 --> 07:11.053
Afraid so.

07:11.077 --> 07:13.087
Hey, remember that
real big one in '89?

07:14.455 --> 07:16.850
Look, um, could we just
leave a check or something?

07:16.874 --> 07:17.893
Well, you could,

07:17.917 --> 07:19.520
except this model's
been discontinued.

07:19.544 --> 07:21.178
I can't get the parts anymore.

07:21.546 --> 07:23.764
You want my advice, you
get yourselves a new one.

07:23.965 --> 07:25.182
Great.

07:25.466 --> 07:26.735
This we don't need.

07:26.759 --> 07:27.986
We could go after school.

07:28.010 --> 07:29.520
No, no way.

07:29.637 --> 07:32.148
Let Charlie handle it. He's
the adult around here.

07:37.603 --> 07:39.530
About that quake in '89...

07:40.982 --> 07:43.367
Did you suffer from
post-traumatic stress syndrome?

07:47.447 --> 07:49.248
Oops, wrong house.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.835
Bailey's in the shower.
You want to join him?

07:52.869 --> 07:54.170
I got school.

07:55.538 --> 07:57.089
If you want, I can
wait outside...

07:57.540 --> 07:58.799
on the sidewalk...

07:59.250 --> 08:00.509
across the street?

08:01.127 --> 08:02.720
Down the block, how's that?

08:10.344 --> 08:12.897
Uh, I'm allergic to wool.

08:13.890 --> 08:14.867
What?

08:14.891 --> 08:16.776
Your sweater. It's wool, right?

08:17.393 --> 08:18.787
Well, even if I wasn't, I...

08:18.811 --> 08:19.705
Allergic,

08:19.729 --> 08:21.155
I wouldn't wear it.

08:21.439 --> 08:23.000
Oh, not the sweater, no.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.293
No, your sweater's really nice.

08:24.317 --> 08:25.335
No, it's just...

08:25.359 --> 08:27.036
have you ever seen
them shave sheep?

08:27.195 --> 08:28.255
Shear sheep...

08:28.279 --> 08:29.506
Have you ever seen that?

08:29.530 --> 08:31.091
Ooh, it looks like it hurts.

08:31.115 --> 08:32.717
Doesn't look like the sheep
are too happy about it,

08:32.741 --> 08:33.677
you know?

08:33.701 --> 08:35.711
It's kind of an animal
cruelty issue really.

08:37.330 --> 08:39.099
I just, I get a rash...

08:39.123 --> 08:40.883
really gross,
around my wrists...

08:41.751 --> 08:42.967
From wool.

08:49.175 --> 08:50.351
You're high.

08:51.928 --> 08:53.062
What?

08:54.472 --> 08:55.532
You're on something.

08:55.556 --> 08:56.982
I am not!

08:57.683 --> 08:58.619
God...

08:58.643 --> 08:59.578
Last night, too.

08:59.602 --> 09:00.579
After... After the earthquake,

09:00.603 --> 09:02.956
you were, you were
bouncing off the walls.

09:02.980 --> 09:04.917
Uh, I was scared, okay?

09:04.941 --> 09:06.168
Same as two million
other people.

09:06.192 --> 09:07.409
Same as Claudia.

09:07.652 --> 09:08.754
It's speed, right?

09:08.778 --> 09:10.589
You are crazy. I am not on...

09:10.613 --> 09:12.122
I lived with a guy in college.

09:13.115 --> 09:15.209
He used to take uppers
to get through exams.

09:15.660 --> 09:19.630
His eyes looked like yours
do, kind of, kind of glazed.

09:20.498 --> 09:23.300
-Wow, what did I ever do to you?

09:24.752 --> 09:25.886
Hey, you're here.

09:31.092 --> 09:32.685
Come on, let's get out of here.

09:44.272 --> 09:45.165
Hi.

09:45.189 --> 09:46.667
Mrs. Rhodes stopped
me in the hall

09:46.691 --> 09:48.001
and asked me to give
you these negatives.

09:48.025 --> 09:49.201
Oh, okay.

09:51.404 --> 09:52.506
Anyway...

09:52.530 --> 09:53.747
Oh, wait a minute.

09:58.369 --> 09:59.429
What is it?

09:59.453 --> 10:00.671
Just wait.

10:09.589 --> 10:12.349
Wait a minute. That's Mr.
Nichols.

10:13.551 --> 10:15.019
Coming out of the
girls' bathroom.

10:16.304 --> 10:17.239
That's the great thing

10:17.263 --> 10:18.898
about being a roving
photographer.

10:19.307 --> 10:21.609
Blackmail can buy you a
lot of new equipment.

10:24.061 --> 10:25.446
Well, I better go.

10:30.359 --> 10:31.702
Whoa.

10:33.070 --> 10:34.204
You all right?

10:34.864 --> 10:35.998
Yeah.

10:41.329 --> 10:43.964
Here. It sticks sometimes.

10:52.048 --> 10:53.641
Well...

10:53.924 --> 10:55.851
we could be stuck
in here for weeks.

10:57.595 --> 10:59.146
Nobody knows we're here.

11:01.140 --> 11:02.274
Nobody?

11:17.698 --> 11:19.124
Did Charlie like Kate?

11:19.158 --> 11:20.417
What?

11:20.701 --> 11:21.887
I was just wondering.

11:21.911 --> 11:23.337
He probably did, huh?

11:24.038 --> 11:26.131
He probably thought you two
belonged together, right?

11:26.374 --> 11:27.591
No.

11:28.626 --> 11:29.843
I don't know.

11:30.544 --> 11:33.065
Jill, you're not still stuck
on the other night, are you?

11:33.089 --> 11:35.683
So he walked in on us,
and he freaked out.

11:35.716 --> 11:36.693
He'll get over it.

11:36.717 --> 11:38.070
I think he's trying
to break us up.

11:38.094 --> 11:39.228
What?

11:39.595 --> 11:41.823
Just because he doesn't want
us doing it in the house?

11:41.847 --> 11:42.783
I really don't think...

11:42.807 --> 11:44.858
He accused me of doing drugs.

11:45.851 --> 11:47.069
What?

11:48.479 --> 11:49.947
Drugs? Are you kidding?

11:50.898 --> 11:52.032
Speed.

11:53.234 --> 11:54.868
He thinks you're doing speed?

11:55.361 --> 11:56.995
He said this to you, really?

11:57.780 --> 11:58.673
Why would he...

11:58.697 --> 12:00.249
I don't know, I...

12:00.616 --> 12:02.344
The only thing I can
think is that maybe

12:02.368 --> 12:04.221
because I've been kind of
jumpy since the earthquake,

12:04.245 --> 12:06.422
but everyone's
been jumpy, right?

12:07.665 --> 12:09.049
I can't believe him!

12:10.501 --> 12:11.978
Where does he get off?

12:12.002 --> 12:13.021
He's probably gonna come to you

12:13.045 --> 12:14.513
and say the same thing.

12:16.841 --> 12:18.559
You don't believe him, do you?

12:19.009 --> 12:19.986
What? No.

12:20.010 --> 12:22.187
'Cause I'm not doing anything.

12:22.888 --> 12:24.064
I'm gonna kill him.

12:24.432 --> 12:25.733
Oh, Bailey...

12:26.851 --> 12:28.193
just let it go.

12:28.644 --> 12:29.820
Really.

12:41.407 --> 12:42.958
So I've been
thinking about it...

12:43.742 --> 12:45.377
and I have to break
up with Libby.

12:46.036 --> 12:47.013
What?

12:47.037 --> 12:49.015
No, you... You can't do that.

12:49.039 --> 12:50.841
Yeah, I can. Why can't I?

12:50.875 --> 12:51.768
Well, because...

12:51.792 --> 12:53.645
Because she really likes you,
and it would totally kill her.

12:53.669 --> 12:55.105
Oh, so I'm supposed to go out

12:55.129 --> 12:56.231
with the girl I
like second-best?

12:56.255 --> 12:58.775
Yeah. It just wouldn't
be fair to her.

12:58.799 --> 13:00.309
Well, I don't care.

13:00.634 --> 13:01.894
Yeah, you do.

13:02.470 --> 13:03.812
Yeah, I do.

13:04.013 --> 13:05.230
Look, Julia...

13:05.514 --> 13:06.700
people break up with people

13:06.724 --> 13:08.910
even when they're not
interested in other people.

13:08.934 --> 13:10.611
I mean, it happens all the time.

13:10.728 --> 13:15.125
And it's not like me and Libby
are engaged or anything.

13:15.149 --> 13:16.376
So sooner or later,

13:16.400 --> 13:18.211
if she's not the person
I want to be with,

13:18.235 --> 13:19.880
then I'm gonna have
to break up with her.

13:19.904 --> 13:20.839
And then I can go out

13:20.863 --> 13:22.247
with whoever I want, right?

13:22.573 --> 13:23.999
Well, I want to go out with you.

13:28.954 --> 13:30.348
What's wrong with that?

13:30.372 --> 13:31.673
Well, it's just...

13:32.082 --> 13:33.300
We should just wait.

13:34.126 --> 13:35.145
For what?

13:35.169 --> 13:37.262
I mean, right now only
one of us is happy.

13:37.296 --> 13:39.181
What's waiting gonna change?

13:39.548 --> 13:41.433
Justin! Julia!

13:50.518 --> 13:51.944
There you are.

13:53.479 --> 13:56.031
I want to know what the hell
your problem is with Jill.

14:00.569 --> 14:02.255
I guess Jill told you
about our conversation.

14:02.279 --> 14:03.548
I want to know what
you got against her

14:03.572 --> 14:04.841
that you would just come out,

14:04.865 --> 14:07.511
and, I mean, out of nowhere,
accuse her of doing speed.

14:07.535 --> 14:08.836
She's on speed, Bay.

14:10.204 --> 14:11.848
Maybe you haven't been around
it long enough to know,

14:11.872 --> 14:13.642
but I have. All the
signs are there.

14:13.666 --> 14:14.643
What signs?

14:14.667 --> 14:16.635
You haven't noticed that
she's wired all the time?

14:17.253 --> 14:19.721
She's high-strung,
that's her personality,

14:19.922 --> 14:22.108
and she works in a
coffeehouse, for God's sakes!

14:22.132 --> 14:24.402
I mean, she drinks, like,
10 cups of coffee a day.

14:24.426 --> 14:26.196
Bailey, I know you don't want
to believe this about her,

14:26.220 --> 14:28.689
that's why you're not seeing
it, but she has a problem.

14:28.722 --> 14:30.440
You're the one who's got
a problem, Charlie.

14:30.599 --> 14:32.494
All the sudden you think
you're <i>Father Knows Best.</i>

14:32.518 --> 14:34.621
You make all the rules, and
you got all the answers.

14:34.645 --> 14:35.831
Fine. Get mad at me.

14:35.855 --> 14:37.082
It doesn't change
what's going on here.

14:37.106 --> 14:39.209
You don't want me to be
with her, just admit it.

14:39.233 --> 14:40.409
Okay.

14:41.652 --> 14:43.162
That's true, you're right.

14:43.904 --> 14:45.799
I don't want this girl
messing up your life, Bay.

14:45.823 --> 14:47.342
So as long as I'm a
good little boy,

14:47.366 --> 14:49.427
and I do my homework
and I drink my milk,

14:49.451 --> 14:50.345
you're okay,

14:50.369 --> 14:51.721
but as soon as I
start dating a girl

14:51.745 --> 14:53.807
who likes to have a little
fun and who isn't a virgin,

14:53.831 --> 14:56.017
you start making up
lies to break us up.

14:56.041 --> 14:58.395
If I wanted to do that Bailey,
if I wanted to lie about her,

14:58.419 --> 14:59.678
why would I go to her?

15:01.547 --> 15:03.233
Come on, Bay, think about it.

15:03.257 --> 15:05.934
If that's true, why would I
go to Jill and not to you?

15:16.312 --> 15:18.498
The National Seismology
Institute says

15:18.522 --> 15:21.450
the first 72 hours after
a quake are crucial.

15:21.984 --> 15:24.995
- So we... -Claud, wasn't this supposed
to be about some kind of plan?

15:25.279 --> 15:26.705
This is important, Bay.

15:26.739 --> 15:28.081
I'm getting to that.

15:28.324 --> 15:29.551
Can you get to it faster?

15:29.575 --> 15:30.886
I've got things to do.

15:30.910 --> 15:31.845
Yeah?

15:31.869 --> 15:33.179
Why don't you try doing
something useful

15:33.203 --> 15:34.764
for a change and go
buy us a new fridge?

15:34.788 --> 15:37.309
Yeah, Charlie, we can't keep
putting ice cubes in the bathtub.

15:37.333 --> 15:38.508
Hello!

15:38.584 --> 15:40.260
This is my meeting.

15:41.170 --> 15:43.680
Thank you. Okay.

15:43.881 --> 15:47.152
Now, if there's an
aftershock or another quake

15:47.176 --> 15:48.403
and if we're separated,

15:48.427 --> 15:50.071
we need some way of
letting each other know

15:50.095 --> 15:51.313
we're okay.

15:51.805 --> 15:53.325
It's easier to get a
long-distance line

15:53.349 --> 15:54.492
after a quake,

15:54.516 --> 15:55.994
so we should all call
somebody long distance

15:56.018 --> 15:57.194
and leave a message.

15:57.603 --> 15:58.747
Like...

15:58.771 --> 15:59.789
Uncle Kurt.

15:59.813 --> 16:00.749
Claud, we can't call France

16:00.773 --> 16:01.875
every time there's
an earthquake.

16:01.899 --> 16:03.209
We should just keep it simple,

16:03.233 --> 16:04.127
like we all call home,

16:04.151 --> 16:05.462
and we keep trying
till we get through.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.287
Okay, here it is.

16:08.656 --> 16:09.998
Plan A.

16:10.199 --> 16:12.302
Ground shakes, call home.

16:12.326 --> 16:14.544
If that fails, Plan B.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.797
Ground shakes, come home.

16:17.289 --> 16:18.632
Any questions?

16:18.666 --> 16:20.342
Yeah. Are we done?

16:20.834 --> 16:22.010
I guess so.

16:22.044 --> 16:22.979
Great.

16:23.003 --> 16:24.189
As long as you all promise

16:24.213 --> 16:26.483
to read the section
entitled "Don't Panic"

16:26.507 --> 16:28.141
in the brochures I gave you.

16:30.719 --> 16:31.853
Ew...

16:32.304 --> 16:34.240
Um, okay. So we, uh,
we clean it out.

16:34.264 --> 16:36.483
It's, what, about
400 square feet?

16:36.892 --> 16:38.193
Which is still too small.

16:38.727 --> 16:40.205
I mean, I need twice
that much space

16:40.229 --> 16:41.697
to make the production schedule,

16:41.897 --> 16:45.284
and that place on Protrero is big
enough for a workshop and a showroom.

16:45.359 --> 16:47.045
And it's also 5.50
a square foot,

16:47.069 --> 16:49.673
and if we get the FX
Gallery contract,

16:49.697 --> 16:50.924
we don't need a showroom.

16:50.948 --> 16:52.592
Gwen, we budgeted
for a workshop,

16:52.616 --> 16:54.835
and I'm sure if we keep looking,
we'll find the right place.

16:55.244 --> 16:56.628
Why don't you work out of here?

16:56.704 --> 16:59.099
That's what I've been trying to tell him.
Thank you.

16:59.123 --> 17:01.008
Because we need more room...

17:01.500 --> 17:02.686
so we can build faster.

17:02.710 --> 17:04.938
The, the faster we build, the
sooner we start selling.

17:04.962 --> 17:07.763
So take the money you
budgeted for rent

17:08.048 --> 17:09.641
and hire another carpenter.

17:10.467 --> 17:11.528
That way you can build faster

17:11.551 --> 17:13.228
and still keep your
overhead down.

17:14.722 --> 17:16.106
Did you need something?

17:16.598 --> 17:17.773
What?

17:18.851 --> 17:20.078
Oh.

17:20.102 --> 17:21.987
Crazy Louie's is having
a refrigerator sale.

17:22.186 --> 17:23.123
I thought we could go.

17:23.146 --> 17:24.698
Well, wait a minute, Charlie.

17:24.940 --> 17:25.916
What's wrong with that idea?

17:25.941 --> 17:27.367
I just don't think it'll work.

17:27.443 --> 17:28.827
Of course, it will.
It's brilliant!

17:30.195 --> 17:32.456
Okay. Whatever.

17:32.740 --> 17:34.333
It's brilliant.

17:36.118 --> 17:38.253
- Libby, what...
- He broke up with me...

17:38.370 --> 17:39.472
Justin.

17:39.496 --> 17:40.630
He did?

17:42.958 --> 17:44.926
He came over after
dinner tonight.

17:48.005 --> 17:50.057
We were supposed to
get frozen yogurt,

17:51.175 --> 17:52.893
and he said he wanted
to talk to me.

17:55.262 --> 17:56.813
I could tell
something was weird.

17:57.097 --> 17:59.024
He parted his hair.

18:00.392 --> 18:01.860
He never parts his hair.

18:02.102 --> 18:03.737
Oh, God, Lib, I'm sorry.

18:05.522 --> 18:07.491
He said that he
really liked me...

18:11.820 --> 18:13.747
but he thought of me
more like a friend...

18:16.658 --> 18:18.001
A really good friend...

18:19.328 --> 18:20.879
Just not a girlfriend.

18:22.081 --> 18:24.132
I asked him if there
was somebody else,

18:24.792 --> 18:26.301
but he said no.

18:33.842 --> 18:35.227
It's okay.

18:36.178 --> 18:37.562
You're gonna be okay.

18:39.056 --> 18:40.524
Will you talk to him?

18:42.434 --> 18:43.787
Talk to him?

18:43.811 --> 18:46.738
Maybe you can tell him that
he's making a mistake,

18:48.524 --> 18:51.461
or maybe you could find out
if it was something I did,

18:51.485 --> 18:53.161
so I can stop doing it.

18:55.364 --> 18:57.082
Please, Julia?

18:58.325 --> 19:00.710
I mean, he'll probably
tell you everything.

19:03.163 --> 19:04.506
Please?

19:06.458 --> 19:07.884
He really likes you.

19:11.171 --> 19:12.472
Sure, okay.

19:13.173 --> 19:15.809
Movies, movies, movies...

19:16.176 --> 19:18.520
Ugh, I can never figure
out the stupid listings.

19:19.263 --> 19:21.241
Have you seen anything good?
Because I haven't.

19:21.265 --> 19:23.034
Oh, well, I went to
see <i>The Lion King.</i>

19:23.058 --> 19:25.485
That was pretty cool. Are you
sure you want to see a movie?

19:26.937 --> 19:28.957
Hey, maybe we could eat
first and then see a movie.

19:28.981 --> 19:30.949
I'm not tired at all.
How about you?

19:31.900 --> 19:32.877
No.

19:32.901 --> 19:34.244
Okay, settled then.

19:41.994 --> 19:43.253
What're you doing?

19:44.329 --> 19:45.547
Nothing.

19:46.623 --> 19:47.883
What're you looking for?

19:52.254 --> 19:53.472
God!

19:53.797 --> 19:55.807
What a creep you are! What?

19:56.383 --> 19:58.518
What, you think I'm lying
to you, is that it?

19:58.802 --> 20:00.446
You trust your stupid brother,

20:00.470 --> 20:01.823
who I told you was
trying to make trouble,

20:01.847 --> 20:03.106
instead of me.

20:05.350 --> 20:07.152
I told you the truth.

20:09.313 --> 20:10.572
I want to look inside.

20:10.772 --> 20:11.875
What?

20:11.899 --> 20:12.959
Well, if there's
nothing in here,

20:12.983 --> 20:14.159
then it shouldn't matter.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.206
Don't.

20:19.323 --> 20:20.707
Just give it back.

20:22.117 --> 20:23.293
Give it.

20:27.039 --> 20:28.423
I want to believe you.

20:45.057 --> 20:46.784
First of all, those aren't
even mine, all right?

20:46.808 --> 20:47.994
They're, like,
mostly my brother's.

20:48.018 --> 20:48.953
Give me a break.

20:48.977 --> 20:50.330
I'm telling you, he
puts it in my bag,

20:50.354 --> 20:52.322
because he doesn't want
my folks to find them!

20:52.981 --> 20:54.115
Jill...

20:54.566 --> 20:55.700
What?

20:57.444 --> 20:58.421
Okay, okay, I'm not saying

20:58.445 --> 20:59.714
that I don't take
them, all right?

20:59.738 --> 21:00.715
I take them sometimes,

21:00.739 --> 21:02.425
like, when I'm really
stressed out at school,

21:02.449 --> 21:04.761
or if I'm working really late at
the coffee shop or something.

21:04.785 --> 21:06.804
I mean, just every
once in a while,

21:06.828 --> 21:08.672
just to keep me going.

21:09.206 --> 21:10.840
What is the big deal?

21:11.541 --> 21:13.019
Are you kidding? What
is the big deal?

21:13.043 --> 21:14.020
You're on drugs.

21:14.044 --> 21:15.845
I am not on drugs!

21:16.213 --> 21:18.473
I take some pills sometimes.

21:18.966 --> 21:21.319
Oh, what, you have never
had a beer or something?

21:21.343 --> 21:22.237
What are these anyway?

21:22.261 --> 21:23.562
I don't even know
what these are.

21:23.887 --> 21:25.105
Is this speed?

21:28.183 --> 21:30.652
Why do we have to make such
a big deal about this?

21:30.811 --> 21:32.163
It doesn't change anything.

21:32.187 --> 21:33.414
It changes everything.

21:33.438 --> 21:34.614
Why?

21:37.943 --> 21:39.160
Okay.

21:39.403 --> 21:42.581
If it matters to you, I
won't take them anymore.

21:43.156 --> 21:44.833
It's really easy to stop.

21:45.784 --> 21:47.127
I'm done with them.

22:02.968 --> 22:04.436
Ice melted again.

22:06.054 --> 22:07.657
Maybe we can go look
at fridges tonight.

22:07.681 --> 22:09.033
The sale's still on.

22:09.057 --> 22:10.159
Yeah.

22:10.183 --> 22:11.651
When I finish this paperwork.

22:14.271 --> 22:15.614
This the carpenter you hired?

22:17.357 --> 22:18.543
That's him.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.201
His work's good.

22:21.611 --> 22:23.079
That's why I hired him.

22:24.114 --> 22:25.258
So what do his clients say?

22:25.282 --> 22:26.541
Is he good with deadlines?

22:27.159 --> 22:28.543
I wouldn't know.

22:29.578 --> 22:30.596
Oh.

22:30.620 --> 22:31.796
Oh?

22:33.081 --> 22:34.341
What does that mean?

22:34.583 --> 22:35.759
Nothing. Just...

22:36.251 --> 22:37.802
you said you wouldn't know.

22:39.129 --> 22:40.972
Just sounds like you didn't
actually talk to him.

22:41.381 --> 22:42.640
I didn't.

22:43.800 --> 22:45.018
Oh.

22:45.218 --> 22:46.353
Oh...

22:46.970 --> 22:48.271
You said "oh" again.

22:48.638 --> 22:49.615
Well, I just thought

22:49.639 --> 22:50.700
when you checked
his references...

22:50.724 --> 22:51.743
I didn't check his references.

22:51.767 --> 22:53.234
I hired him based on his work.

22:54.936 --> 22:56.748
Well, shouldn't we have
talked about this first?

22:56.772 --> 22:59.042
I mean, I, I did invest
in this company,

22:59.066 --> 23:00.585
and I think it's
smart business to...

23:00.609 --> 23:03.203
So now I'm stupid because I
didn't check his references.

23:03.653 --> 23:05.246
I think I'll, um...

23:05.655 --> 23:07.925
I'll check to see if our water
heater is bolted to the wall.

23:07.949 --> 23:10.803
No. All I'm saying is I
loaned you the money,

23:10.827 --> 23:12.055
and call me deranged,

23:12.079 --> 23:14.182
but I thought I might have a
little say in how it's used.

23:14.206 --> 23:15.840
Kirsten, I know what
I'm doing here.

23:17.292 --> 23:18.885
Maybe you should be
a silent partner.

23:30.138 --> 23:32.273
<i>Short Cuts</i> is at the
film society on Friday.

23:32.849 --> 23:34.526
Yeah, I know. Libby wants to go.

23:36.686 --> 23:37.946
Oh...

23:38.730 --> 23:40.990
- And you said yes?
- Yes. I said yes.

23:41.358 --> 23:43.326
She's very upset.
She needs a friend.

23:45.153 --> 23:46.538
Well...

23:47.447 --> 23:49.592
Anyway, she calls me on
the phone all the time.

23:49.616 --> 23:51.501
We've been having coffee.

23:51.618 --> 23:53.837
You dumped her, and
now I'm dating her.

23:55.330 --> 23:56.557
What do you guys talk about?

23:56.581 --> 23:57.966
About you.

23:58.208 --> 24:00.927
About why you broke up with her,
whether you still like her,

24:01.086 --> 24:03.096
why she can't bring
herself to hate you.

24:03.672 --> 24:06.109
And I feel really
crummy about this.

24:06.133 --> 24:08.143
It's kind of like guilt torture.

24:08.343 --> 24:09.561
It...

24:10.011 --> 24:11.479
What do you want to do?

24:12.180 --> 24:13.991
I mean, I want to still see you.

24:14.015 --> 24:17.318
Look, I can't say no to
her right now, okay?

24:18.061 --> 24:19.831
There's only so many
miserable, selfish things

24:19.855 --> 24:20.873
a person can do in one week.

24:20.897 --> 24:21.874
Yeah, but...

24:21.898 --> 24:23.283
I'm gonna tell her about us.

24:24.568 --> 24:26.337
Oh, that's... That's
a really good idea.

24:26.361 --> 24:28.089
That'll make her
feel a lot better.

24:28.113 --> 24:29.757
I can't lie to her anymore,

24:29.781 --> 24:31.499
and she's gonna find
out sooner or later.

24:31.700 --> 24:34.377
Okay, well, this is a
little too "sooner" for me.

24:37.622 --> 24:39.799
Well, I'll let you know how
we both liked the film.

24:42.878 --> 24:44.804
- Hi.
- Hi.

24:46.882 --> 24:48.391
Lose something?

24:48.466 --> 24:49.569
I know I brought them.

24:49.593 --> 24:51.853
I put them on the hall table
so I wouldn't forget.

24:52.179 --> 24:53.480
Forget what?

24:53.722 --> 24:55.190
My sunglasses.

24:57.225 --> 24:58.735
They're on your head.

25:03.690 --> 25:06.284
Okay, Alzheimer's
has just kicked in.

25:10.822 --> 25:12.081
What?

25:12.616 --> 25:13.833
Nothing.

25:15.619 --> 25:18.097
I just thought I forgot my
sunglasses, that's all.

25:18.121 --> 25:19.464
I know.

25:21.416 --> 25:23.343
Is this what it's
gonna be like now?

25:23.835 --> 25:25.021
Huh? You looking at me funny,

25:25.045 --> 25:26.105
wondering if I'm high?

25:26.129 --> 25:28.431
No, that's not what
I was thinking.

25:28.632 --> 25:29.933
Really.

25:30.550 --> 25:31.726
Really.

25:33.011 --> 25:34.229
Okay.

25:34.512 --> 25:35.730
Whatever you say.

25:42.687 --> 25:43.947
3.1.

25:44.397 --> 25:45.499
Bigger. 3.8.

25:45.523 --> 25:46.950
Nah, it was nothing.

25:51.029 --> 25:54.374
Yeah. You're right,
it was nothing.

25:58.286 --> 25:59.680
I guess I expected it, so...

25:59.704 --> 26:00.973
Well, he's gotta
understand, you know.

26:00.997 --> 26:02.173
I know.

26:02.707 --> 26:04.300
Oh, you're still alive.

26:04.376 --> 26:05.895
What are you talking about?
Of course, we are.

26:05.919 --> 26:07.146
Well, in case you missed it,

26:07.170 --> 26:09.556
we had an aftershock
almost three hours ago.

26:09.798 --> 26:10.974
What?

26:11.508 --> 26:12.985
God, Claud, that was tiny.

26:13.009 --> 26:14.862
Yeah, you could
barely even feel it.

26:14.886 --> 26:16.364
Well, I felt it,

26:16.388 --> 26:18.532
and the plan was, "ground
shakes, call home."

26:18.556 --> 26:19.492
Period.

26:19.516 --> 26:21.494
I've been sitting by the
phone and watching the news

26:21.518 --> 26:22.995
to make sure you guys
weren't, like, trapped

26:23.019 --> 26:24.696
in some collapsed
parking garage.

26:24.813 --> 26:25.998
I even tried to call France

26:26.022 --> 26:28.626
on the off-chance that you
got confused about the plan,

26:28.650 --> 26:30.336
but did anybody bother to call?

26:30.360 --> 26:31.337
No.

26:31.361 --> 26:32.797
Claud, if it had been big,

26:32.821 --> 26:34.340
I mean, big enough to
do any damage at all,

26:34.364 --> 26:35.832
don't you know we'd be here?

26:36.074 --> 26:37.009
I mean, don't you know

26:37.033 --> 26:38.876
we'd drop everything to
get to you and Owen?

26:38.910 --> 26:40.429
Well, what if the
house collapses,

26:40.453 --> 26:41.921
and you can't get to us?

26:42.038 --> 26:45.008
Claud, do you know how long
this house has been here?

26:45.667 --> 26:47.051
Since like...

26:47.335 --> 26:49.012
Like 1910.

26:49.337 --> 26:52.024
I mean, do you know how many earthquakes
this place has been through?

26:52.048 --> 26:53.401
And it's still standing, right?

26:53.425 --> 26:54.642
Right.

26:55.552 --> 26:57.321
They don't build houses
like this anymore.

26:57.345 --> 26:59.615
In fact, this is probably
the safest place you can be

26:59.639 --> 27:00.866
in an earthquake.

27:00.890 --> 27:02.775
We're not gonna let
anything happen, Claud.

27:03.059 --> 27:04.861
I promise. Nothing's
gonna happen.

27:10.191 --> 27:13.661
Maybe if I got some sleep,
I'd be less stressed out.

27:14.112 --> 27:15.413
Absolutely.

27:15.655 --> 27:16.914
Good idea.

27:25.874 --> 27:27.550
Maybe we're getting
better at this.

27:34.132 --> 27:35.475
What's this?

27:38.595 --> 27:40.021
Your money.

27:41.264 --> 27:42.690
I don't want it.

27:43.099 --> 27:44.368
I can't take this anymore.

27:44.392 --> 27:46.861
Take what? My advice?

27:47.187 --> 27:49.165
The fact that I might
have a brain in my head?

27:49.189 --> 27:50.458
What, Charlie?

27:50.482 --> 27:52.960
I can't put up with you
second-guessing me all the time.

27:52.984 --> 27:55.004
So you'd rather let this whole
thing go down the drain

27:55.028 --> 27:57.288
than listen to a single
thing I have to say?

27:57.322 --> 27:58.674
Great solution, Charlie.

27:58.698 --> 28:01.125
I am not letting anything
go down the drain.

28:01.826 --> 28:03.670
I want this business, just...

28:04.579 --> 28:05.890
not at this price.

28:05.914 --> 28:07.256
I can't believe you.

28:07.332 --> 28:08.809
I was only trying to help.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.259
Yeah, well, maybe we need to...

28:10.335 --> 28:11.312
A little bit more time

28:11.336 --> 28:12.772
before we start throwing
money into the mix.

28:12.796 --> 28:15.181
Or, or maybe I do, I don't know.

28:15.507 --> 28:17.526
At any rate, I feel
like we'd be better off

28:17.550 --> 28:18.935
if I just...

28:19.761 --> 28:21.729
figured out a way to
do this on my own.

28:22.013 --> 28:23.231
Then fine.

28:24.599 --> 28:25.910
Suit yourself.

28:25.934 --> 28:27.244
This isn't just for me, Kirsten.

28:27.268 --> 28:28.695
This is for us.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.572
This was not a good
thing going on here.

28:32.774 --> 28:34.659
So now we can just...

28:35.360 --> 28:37.922
move forward, and, and
go about our lives.

28:37.946 --> 28:39.455
Great.

28:39.656 --> 28:41.624
That appliance sale
ends tomorrow.

28:44.202 --> 28:45.461
Fine.

28:46.454 --> 28:48.006
Then we'll go.

28:48.331 --> 28:49.809
See, that is the kind of thing

28:49.833 --> 28:51.509
that we should be
doing together.

29:04.097 --> 29:06.190
Hey, you want to go to
Sonoma this weekend?

29:06.224 --> 29:07.743
The Renaissance Fair is in town,

29:07.767 --> 29:10.403
and my folks are taking
me to cheer me up.

29:10.603 --> 29:12.113
Sounds fun.

29:13.481 --> 29:15.324
So you look like
you're doing okay.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.244
Are you doing okay?

29:18.653 --> 29:19.755
Yeah.

29:19.779 --> 29:21.914
Because sometimes it's hard when
someone breaks up with you.

29:23.032 --> 29:24.760
You've never broke
up with anybody,

29:24.784 --> 29:25.720
how would you know?

29:25.744 --> 29:27.722
Well, people do a
lot of stupid stuff

29:27.746 --> 29:28.681
when they're dating,

29:28.705 --> 29:30.349
and you never know
what's gonna happen.

29:30.373 --> 29:31.966
What're you talking about?

29:33.126 --> 29:34.594
Are you dating somebody?

29:35.545 --> 29:37.805
Julia, how come you
didn't tell me?

29:39.382 --> 29:40.600
Libby, there's something...

29:43.344 --> 29:45.730
- What's that?
- I don't know.

29:56.065 --> 29:57.784
And what's he doing here?

29:58.109 --> 30:01.162
Justin didn't know that I was
studying at your house tonight.

30:13.166 --> 30:14.383
You're kidding?

30:17.128 --> 30:18.679
Libby, I'm really sorry.

30:24.469 --> 30:26.104
Can't I just wait in the car?

30:26.179 --> 30:28.314
This'll just take a second.
I'm on ice patrol.

30:32.852 --> 30:34.112
Bailey!

31:40.378 --> 31:41.596
Hey.

31:46.301 --> 31:47.852
What's the matter? Did
something happen?

31:48.511 --> 31:50.021
Yeah, something did.

31:50.722 --> 31:52.616
Claudia was sleeping
in the shower tonight.

31:52.640 --> 31:53.941
She was?

31:54.392 --> 31:55.744
I thought for sure
after last night

31:55.768 --> 31:56.986
she was finally okay.

31:57.103 --> 31:58.529
Hey, look, I'll talk to her.

31:58.813 --> 32:00.323
She's not the problem.

32:02.108 --> 32:03.743
While she was in the shower, um,

32:03.818 --> 32:04.962
Jill came in,

32:04.986 --> 32:06.589
and she went to the
medicine cabinet,

32:06.613 --> 32:08.247
and she took some pills.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.333
Claudia saw her.

32:16.748 --> 32:18.350
Well, didn't you stop to
think that maybe there's a,

32:18.374 --> 32:19.800
there's a good explanation?

32:19.834 --> 32:21.510
Like, maybe they were aspirin?

32:22.837 --> 32:23.731
Huh?

32:23.755 --> 32:24.815
I mean, it's not like Claudia's

32:24.839 --> 32:26.474
some drug expert or anything.

32:28.051 --> 32:29.977
It's Darvax from when
Mom hurt her back.

32:30.762 --> 32:32.072
It's a really strong
drug, Bailey.

32:32.096 --> 32:33.481
Yeah, I know what
kind of drug it is.

32:33.681 --> 32:35.451
You don't steal drugs from
somebody's medicine cabinet

32:35.475 --> 32:36.692
unless things are pretty bad.

32:41.105 --> 32:42.531
I'll take care of it. Thanks.

32:43.358 --> 32:44.992
She needs to get help, Bay.

32:45.652 --> 32:46.994
In the meantime,

32:47.153 --> 32:49.372
we'd feel better if she didn't
come around here so much.

32:49.447 --> 32:50.665
What?

32:52.617 --> 32:53.552
What're you doing?

32:53.576 --> 32:54.762
What are you, kicking
her out of here?

32:54.786 --> 32:55.763
Is that what you're doing?

32:55.787 --> 32:57.306
Shh! Claud's sleeping.
Keep your voice down.

32:57.330 --> 32:59.058
Screw this. This
is my house, too.

32:59.082 --> 33:01.477
She's stealing, Bay, and
she's lying to you.

33:01.501 --> 33:02.978
She's not in control.

33:03.002 --> 33:04.470
And we don't want to
see you get hurt.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.273
Wait, you think you're
making this better,

33:06.297 --> 33:07.723
making me choose?

33:08.216 --> 33:10.559
You are making it so much
worse, I can't tell you.

33:11.552 --> 33:12.571
This is my house.

33:12.595 --> 33:14.031
You don't tell me what to
do with my girlfriend.

33:14.055 --> 33:15.898
There is no way in hell
I'm putting up with that.

33:28.361 --> 33:30.673
Coolair CA-526.

33:30.697 --> 33:33.207
Ice dispenser, accessible doors.

33:33.866 --> 33:34.969
Look at this,

33:34.993 --> 33:37.336
handy built-in juice dispenser.

33:37.954 --> 33:39.640
All this for 1100 bucks.

33:39.664 --> 33:41.757
Good brand, good price.

33:42.875 --> 33:44.061
Great.

33:44.085 --> 33:45.020
It's perfect.

33:45.044 --> 33:46.721
I'll draw up the paperwork.

33:46.754 --> 33:49.056
Uh, could you give us a minute?

33:49.924 --> 33:51.392
Take your time.

33:53.970 --> 33:55.197
What's wrong?

33:55.221 --> 33:57.741
It's big enough, it's
in our price range.

33:57.765 --> 34:00.359
It got a black dot under
crisper humidity.

34:01.394 --> 34:02.862
Crisper... What?

34:03.229 --> 34:04.540
Humidity.

34:04.564 --> 34:06.041
In the <i>Consumer's Guide.</i>

34:06.065 --> 34:07.825
We don't want soggy lettuce.

34:08.443 --> 34:10.328
When do we ever have lettuce?

34:10.945 --> 34:13.998
It also scored low on
temperature uniformity.

34:14.489 --> 34:18.293
The best overall rating
went to the Frostspot 253.

34:19.078 --> 34:20.670
There's no juice dispenser.

34:21.748 --> 34:24.842
Juice dispenser's drive up
your annual maintenance costs.

34:25.083 --> 34:26.886
I like the juice dispenser.

34:28.713 --> 34:30.690
The Coolair's only
available in ivory.

34:30.715 --> 34:32.317
Ivory shows fingerprints.

34:32.341 --> 34:34.027
The Frostspot comes in ecru.

34:34.052 --> 34:35.978
Ecru? What the hell is that?

34:36.219 --> 34:37.197
<i>Consumer Guide</i> says...

34:37.221 --> 34:39.065
I don't care what
<i>Consumer Guide</i> says.

34:39.681 --> 34:41.784
I want the Coolair with
the juice dispenser

34:41.809 --> 34:42.943
in ivory.

34:43.351 --> 34:45.196
And I think it's a bad idea.

34:45.563 --> 34:47.364
Why, because I thought of it?

34:48.983 --> 34:51.085
Well, you folks
ready to talk deal?

34:51.110 --> 34:52.170
- No.
- No.

34:52.195 --> 34:53.505
You don't want the
Frostspot because I do.

34:53.529 --> 34:54.840
You don't trust me to
buy a refrigerator.

34:54.864 --> 34:55.966
I didn't say that.
What's with you?

34:55.989 --> 34:56.884
Me? What is with you?

34:56.908 --> 35:00.294
Maintenance costs? Crisper
uniformity? Ecru?

35:00.578 --> 35:03.297
God, Kirsten, it's not even
your money I'm spending here.

35:09.629 --> 35:11.347
Libby, um...

35:17.720 --> 35:18.938
Libby, please.

35:19.305 --> 35:20.773
I'm not talking to you.

35:21.390 --> 35:22.983
I wanted to tell you.

35:23.768 --> 35:25.528
I just wanted to
figure out a good way.

35:26.896 --> 35:27.956
A good way?

35:27.980 --> 35:29.500
And I feel really
bad about this,

35:29.524 --> 35:30.417
and I'm just trying to...

35:30.441 --> 35:32.118
You could've had Justin before.

35:32.193 --> 35:34.370
Oh, but then he wasn't
good enough for you.

35:34.612 --> 35:35.955
Now he is.

35:36.197 --> 35:37.998
Now that he's my boyfriend.

35:39.450 --> 35:40.469
Was.

35:40.493 --> 35:41.512
That's not what happened.

35:41.536 --> 35:43.879
Libby, I just... I
couldn't help it.

35:45.164 --> 35:47.341
That is such a lame excuse.

35:47.375 --> 35:48.884
Of course, you could.

35:49.085 --> 35:51.188
If something happened
between you and Justin,

35:51.212 --> 35:52.648
and you were really my friend,

35:52.672 --> 35:54.348
you could've said no.

35:55.675 --> 35:56.934
That's true.

35:57.218 --> 35:58.561
I'm sorry.

35:58.636 --> 36:00.322
The last thing I need right now

36:00.346 --> 36:03.357
is to think about you and
Justin feeling sorry for me,

36:03.391 --> 36:05.452
because, frankly, that
makes me want to throw up.

36:05.476 --> 36:07.111
And there's nothing I can say?

36:07.603 --> 36:09.947
You don't actually think I'm
gonna forgive you, do you?

36:11.107 --> 36:12.366
You know what, Julia?

36:14.277 --> 36:16.245
I really hate you for this.

36:25.913 --> 36:27.131
Hi, Claudia.

36:28.958 --> 36:30.259
What are you doing?

36:31.002 --> 36:33.721
They say animals act funny
just before a quake,

36:34.755 --> 36:37.558
but with Thurber, it's
kind of hard to tell.

36:37.800 --> 36:38.694
Kirsten...

36:38.718 --> 36:41.479
Oh, Charlie, look,
I've been thinking.

36:44.891 --> 36:46.192
So have I.

36:46.475 --> 36:47.619
And I don't think
this is a problem

36:47.643 --> 36:49.570
about money or refrigerators.

36:49.645 --> 36:52.207
Exactly, and, and
it's not about trust.

36:52.231 --> 36:53.667
Or faith.

36:53.691 --> 36:55.377
We just have a few
basic differences.

36:55.401 --> 36:57.337
Right. Like, like the
way we make decisions.

36:57.361 --> 36:58.672
And I mean, I mean,
you go by the book...

36:58.696 --> 37:00.122
And you trust your gut.

37:00.198 --> 37:02.551
Both are perfectly valid
approaches to life.

37:02.575 --> 37:03.709
Right.

37:04.911 --> 37:06.045
Okay.

37:07.288 --> 37:09.048
So I want to try this again.

37:09.123 --> 37:11.592
I want you to take back the
money for the business.

37:13.085 --> 37:16.096
Well, thanks, but,
um, I don't need it.

37:16.255 --> 37:17.598
You don't?

37:18.049 --> 37:20.986
We took the designs and
the cost projections

37:21.010 --> 37:22.571
and the money that Gwen
already had in escrow,

37:22.595 --> 37:24.438
and we made a pitch to the bank,

37:24.889 --> 37:26.867
and it's not definite yet,

37:26.891 --> 37:29.109
but I have a feeling we're
actually gonna get a loan.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.612
Charlie, that's great! That's...

37:32.396 --> 37:33.415
Aftershock!

37:33.439 --> 37:34.657
Thurber!

37:35.024 --> 37:36.992
It wasn't an
aftershock, Claudia.

37:38.236 --> 37:40.704
It was a Coolair CA-526.

37:42.865 --> 37:44.760
Um, Kirsten, I...

37:44.784 --> 37:46.460
Don't say anything.
Don't say anything.

37:47.036 --> 37:49.338
You wanted a juice dispenser,
you should have a...

37:53.834 --> 37:57.263
It's a Frostspot FS-253 in ecru.

37:58.714 --> 38:01.308
So which one should
we send back?

38:07.098 --> 38:08.732
You want to do
something tonight?

38:09.934 --> 38:11.652
Go hear some music or something.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.613
I don't think so.

38:15.690 --> 38:16.865
Yeah.

38:18.150 --> 38:20.077
I'm thinking about
dropping yearbook.

38:22.405 --> 38:24.841
You know, whoever said "All's
fair in love and war,"

38:24.865 --> 38:26.625
wasn't the person who got hurt.

38:27.159 --> 38:29.336
It was obviously the
person who won.

38:31.539 --> 38:32.881
Well, that's us.

38:33.291 --> 38:34.842
Yeah, that's us.

38:35.543 --> 38:36.812
We like each other.

38:36.836 --> 38:38.429
That's allowed.

38:39.046 --> 38:40.389
I know. It's...

38:40.923 --> 38:42.943
You just start finding
things out about yourself,

38:42.967 --> 38:45.894
you know, like the things
you're willing to do to people.

38:47.930 --> 38:49.106
Yeah.

38:51.350 --> 38:54.903
Well... we're together.

38:55.938 --> 38:57.281
Are you glad about that?

38:57.356 --> 38:59.575
Yeah, I'm glad. I
just wish that...

39:02.528 --> 39:03.787
I don't know.

39:05.114 --> 39:07.875
Yeah. I don't know either...

39:10.578 --> 39:12.254
but I like sitting
here with you.

39:13.622 --> 39:15.350
I mean, we don't have
to do anything else.

39:15.374 --> 39:17.176
We could just sit here.

39:20.129 --> 39:21.597
Do you like sitting with me?

39:22.381 --> 39:24.183
I like sitting with you a lot.

39:25.176 --> 39:27.186
How about standing?
Do you like standing?

39:29.513 --> 39:31.106
Standing's nice.

39:32.016 --> 39:33.233
How about hopping?

39:34.477 --> 39:36.288
Hopping is actually
a little strange.

39:36.312 --> 39:37.946
Yeah, you're probably right.

39:45.863 --> 39:47.289
It's gonna be all right.

39:49.367 --> 39:50.876
You don't know that.

40:02.004 --> 40:02.981
Hey.

40:03.005 --> 40:04.223
Hey...

40:04.465 --> 40:05.942
Can I interest you in
a <i>Sports Illustrated</i>

40:05.966 --> 40:07.476
from the Bush administration?

40:08.386 --> 40:11.188
I finally got Patty to
spring for new mags.

40:12.181 --> 40:13.524
You got a minute?

40:13.808 --> 40:16.151
Um, yeah. Sure.

40:32.493 --> 40:34.336
I have a really
good time with you.

40:36.247 --> 40:38.215
I have a really good
time with you, too.

40:39.708 --> 40:41.427
I don't want to be
with anyone else.

40:41.961 --> 40:43.137
Bailey...

40:44.505 --> 40:46.098
I know about the Darvax.

40:48.008 --> 40:49.518
Claudia saw you take it.

40:50.386 --> 40:51.905
It's not what you think.
I can explain...

40:51.929 --> 40:53.147
I don't want you to.

40:53.681 --> 40:54.857
Please.

40:55.099 --> 40:57.776
Please don't explain, because
I won't believe you...

40:58.727 --> 40:59.704
Whatever you say...

40:59.728 --> 41:03.250
Because you lied to me when
you said you weren't using,

41:03.274 --> 41:05.659
and you lied to me when
you said you stopped.

41:07.486 --> 41:09.288
And if you honestly
don't believe

41:09.405 --> 41:11.999
that you have a problem,
then what can I do?

41:19.665 --> 41:21.508
So I can't be with you anymore,

41:23.294 --> 41:24.762
and I'm sorry.

41:24.795 --> 41:26.388
I'm really sorry, because...

41:27.131 --> 41:30.152
Because I really care about you,
and I want you to get some help,

41:30.176 --> 41:33.061
but... I guess...

41:36.223 --> 41:37.608
I guess...

41:43.439 --> 41:44.698
I'll just see you.

41:48.152 --> 41:49.745
Bailey, wait.

41:50.154 --> 41:51.288
Wait!

41:51.489 --> 41:52.915
Okay, you're right!

41:53.115 --> 41:55.417
You're right! I do
have a problem.

41:56.577 --> 41:58.128
Look, I'm sorry, Bailey.

41:58.370 --> 41:59.671
I tried.

41:59.997 --> 42:02.559
I meant what I said when I promised you.
I really meant it,

42:02.583 --> 42:04.593
I really tried, but I couldn't.

42:05.002 --> 42:06.188
I couldn't.

42:06.212 --> 42:07.272
And I only lied to you,

42:07.296 --> 42:09.306
because I was afraid
that you'd leave.

42:10.549 --> 42:11.683
And see?

42:12.801 --> 42:14.228
You are anyway.

42:15.387 --> 42:16.939
Don't go, Bailey.

42:17.681 --> 42:20.859
Please... don't walk away.

42:21.852 --> 42:23.371
I can't do this by myself.

42:23.395 --> 42:25.322
I can't stop if you walk away.

42:27.024 --> 42:28.242
So don't.

42:28.943 --> 42:30.369
Don't walk away.

42:33.280 --> 42:34.623
Please...

42:41.163 --> 42:42.422
Okay.

43:09.483 --> 43:10.377
Should I ask?

43:10.401 --> 43:12.546
Shh! It's Claudia's idea.

43:12.570 --> 43:14.288
It's the only place
she feels safe.

43:14.572 --> 43:16.123
It's just for tonight.

43:16.198 --> 43:18.125
Unless we have
another aftershock.

43:18.284 --> 43:19.877
Then we're gonna have
her institutionalized.

43:20.953 --> 43:22.462
Well, if it was her
idea, where is she?

43:22.871 --> 43:24.381
Up front with Owen.

43:37.595 --> 43:38.812
Is there room for me?

43:39.179 --> 43:40.949
Sure. Just don't rock the truck.

43:40.973 --> 43:42.691
Trust me, you don't
want her to wake up.

43:50.608 --> 43:52.117
Come on, Charlie, shove over.

43:53.360 --> 43:54.379
Ow!

43:54.403 --> 43:56.204
Shh! Be quiet.
