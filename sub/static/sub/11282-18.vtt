CHRIS ROCK:
When I was 16, I crossed a
major milestone for teenagers.

00:10.378 --> 00:14.082
I finally got
my driver's license.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.783
* Here in my car...

00:15.816 --> 00:17.385
The difference
between taking the bus

00:17.418 --> 00:19.753
and being able to drive
was obvious.

00:19.787 --> 00:21.655
Hey, Tasha, I'm going
down to Alby Square.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.724
You want to come?
Are you taking the bus?

00:23.757 --> 00:25.459
Yeah.
No.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.794
Did I mention I have
a two

00:26.827 --> 00:29.263
Hey, Tasha, I'm going
down to Alby Square.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.431
You want to come?
Yeah.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.532
I was just about to go there.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.535
Bye, Chris.
See you downtown.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.412
Back home at dinner,
the only thing

00:44.445 --> 00:46.380
I was hungry for was a car.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.715
Boy, this is
not a library.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.617
If it was, you'd be quiet.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.553
I'm sorry-- I'm looking
for a good deal on a used car.

00:52.586 --> 00:54.355
A car?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.490
Yeah. Since I have my license,
I figured I should have a car.

00:56.524 --> 00:57.425
Did you figure

00:57.458 --> 00:58.826
I would tell you you were crazy?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.261
If Chris gets a car,

01:00.294 --> 01:02.263
can I have a football helmet?
For what?

01:02.296 --> 01:04.332
Because I don't want to be
on the street unprotected.

01:04.365 --> 01:05.533
I think you should get

01:05.566 --> 01:06.534
a Suzuki Samurai.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.568
That's because he thought

01:07.601 --> 01:08.869
the car came with a sword.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.571
But if you don't
get a Samurai,

01:10.604 --> 01:11.672
you should get a Audi 5000.

01:11.705 --> 01:13.307
That way, when
you leave a place,

01:13.341 --> 01:14.575
you're, like,
"Yo, I'm Audi 5000,

01:14.608 --> 01:16.544
and then you'd be in one--
that'd be cool.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.411
Chris is
not getting

01:17.445 --> 01:19.280
a car.
Come on, Ma,

01:19.313 --> 01:21.115
I saved up $300,
I got my license--

01:21.149 --> 01:22.250
what else do I need?

01:22.283 --> 01:23.351
My permission.

01:23.384 --> 01:25.753
$300? That's
a lot of dollars.

01:25.786 --> 01:27.355
300, to be exact.

01:27.388 --> 01:28.656
If he's old enough to save up

01:28.689 --> 01:30.224
that kind of money,
he's old enough

01:30.258 --> 01:31.359
to spend it
on what he wants.

01:31.392 --> 01:34.528
It's a good thing I was
too young for strip clubs.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.909
* Ah, make it funky now.

02:08.229 --> 02:11.899
I soon found out that
buying a used car wasn't easy.

02:13.401 --> 02:14.935
You had to watch out for scams.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.504
$300? That car's gone.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.539
But we got this one.

02:18.572 --> 02:20.241
Only $15,000.

02:20.274 --> 02:23.544
$300 down, $300 a month
for 300 months.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.814
And some deals were
just too good to be true.

02:26.847 --> 02:28.216
That's right, little dude.

02:28.249 --> 02:29.717
This car is brand-new.

02:29.750 --> 02:33.821
And I'm gonna let you have it
for only $300.

02:33.854 --> 02:37.157
Hey, fool!
Get off my new car!

02:37.991 --> 02:39.193
All right, all right.

02:39.227 --> 02:43.664
But sometimes the best deals
are right under your nose.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.668
This car is you, nephew!

02:47.701 --> 02:49.703
Let me take another picture.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.839
Yeah... you are hot!

02:53.541 --> 02:55.676
That's it right there,
nephew, that's it.

02:55.709 --> 02:57.611
This is it.
I don't know.

02:57.645 --> 03:00.281
I think I want to look around
a little bit more.

03:00.314 --> 03:02.216
What for?
That's a good car.

03:02.250 --> 03:05.553
Radio works, no dents,
you got a spare in the back,

03:05.586 --> 03:07.588
and it only costs $300.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.624
Plus, you can't even see
the hole in the backseat
where the girl shot at me

03:10.658 --> 03:11.925
over a chicken sandwich.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.262
There's a lot of people
pay a lot more money

03:14.295 --> 03:16.630
for a car like that.
Then why haven't you
sold it already?

03:16.664 --> 03:18.466
Classified ads
are expensive.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.001
If you hadn't called me,
I would've kept it for myself.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.903
And trade it to somebody
for a sandwich.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.873
Hey, Chris. Did I just
see you driving that car?

03:25.906 --> 03:27.708
Yeah, I'm thinking
about buying it.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.443
Wow. You're buying a car?

03:29.477 --> 03:31.345
Yeah.
TASHA:
Look at you.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.946
Well, make sure I get a ride.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.248
Maybe we can go shopping.

03:34.282 --> 03:38.686
All right.
And you could spend
the rest of your money on her.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.820
I'll take it!

03:39.853 --> 03:41.922
Cool.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.491
I'm gonna go upstairs
and get a pen

03:43.524 --> 03:44.692
so I can sign over
the pink slip.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.694
Here. That's for you.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.996
Ha-ha!

03:49.029 --> 03:50.964
While I was checking out
my new ride,

03:50.998 --> 03:53.767
Drew was checking out
his new pen.

03:53.801 --> 03:55.569
Now you have clothes...

03:55.603 --> 03:57.271
now you don't.

03:57.305 --> 03:59.740
Drew. Let me
borrow that pen.
Huh?

03:59.773 --> 04:01.609
Let me borrow your pen.

04:01.642 --> 04:03.711
Oh, uh, this pen
doesn't work.

04:03.744 --> 04:05.746
I'll go get you one.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.851
That's not suspicious at all.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.589
Whew!

04:15.623 --> 04:18.459
And while Drew acted
like he wasn't hiding anything,

04:18.492 --> 04:20.628
Tonya was acting like my mom.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.296
I don't need this!

04:22.330 --> 04:24.732
My man has two jobs! Hmm.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.066
Someday she's
gonna make somebody

04:26.099 --> 04:28.336
a great ex-wife.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.608
Cigarettes?

04:34.642 --> 04:36.076
"Surgeon General's Warning:

04:36.109 --> 04:39.680
"Smoking causes lung cancer,
heart disease, emphysema,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.715
and may complicate pregnancy."

04:44.885 --> 04:47.421
Hmm. Good thing
they got these filters.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.658
While Tonya was dressing
like my mother,

04:50.691 --> 04:53.561
Drew was undressing his pen.

04:58.766 --> 05:01.001
While Drew was hiding his pen,

05:01.034 --> 05:03.771
my dad was trying
to find a winner.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.105
Lakemuffin?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.375
I wonder if he's related
to Seabiscuit.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.376
Hey, Dad.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.010
You got a pen?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.413
Uh... what do you
need a pen for?

05:12.446 --> 05:13.414
For Uncle Michael.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.782
Oh.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.883
No.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.685
What are you doing?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.587
Nothing.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.355
Nothing he wants you
to know about.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.856
Have you seen my
sports magazine?

05:22.890 --> 05:24.725
No.

05:33.801 --> 05:37.671
She better quit fake smoking,
or she'll get fake cancer.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.774
What are you
doing in here?

05:40.808 --> 05:42.410
I was playing.

05:42.443 --> 05:43.477
Play somewhere else.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.679
Go play with matches.

05:54.655 --> 05:57.024
Hey, Ma, do you have
a pen for Uncle Michael?

05:57.057 --> 05:59.893
I think there's one upstairs--
I'll go get it for you.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.062
Cool.

06:02.095 --> 06:03.897
Meanwhile, Tonya
was hiding cigarettes

06:03.931 --> 06:05.933
like she was in prison.

06:08.068 --> 06:09.837
Tonya?

06:09.870 --> 06:11.472
Do you have a pen?

06:11.505 --> 06:12.806
For what?

06:12.840 --> 06:15.843
For me not to smack
the smart out of you.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.879
Now, find a pen
and give it to Drew.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.785
Hey, babe.
Hey.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.488
Have you...
have we got a pen?

06:28.656 --> 06:30.858
You mean like this one?

06:30.891 --> 06:32.860
:
Okay. Thanks.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.695
:
Right there.

06:35.696 --> 06:37.931
Hey, man, you got that pen?

06:37.965 --> 06:40.067
Uh, Mom's bringing one.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.069
Here, Drew,
here's a pen.
Oh.

06:42.102 --> 06:43.036
Here you go, Uncle Michael.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.572
Sweet!

06:46.740 --> 06:47.941
Big man!

06:47.975 --> 06:49.777
Hey, Michael.

06:49.810 --> 06:51.712
Here's that pen, Drew.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.818
This house is full of pens!

06:57.851 --> 06:58.852
What's going on?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.888
Chris just bought my car!

07:01.889 --> 07:03.691
Congratulations.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.693
So, you got a car, huh?
Yeah.

07:05.726 --> 07:06.960
You sign that pink slip?

07:06.994 --> 07:08.562
Sure did.

07:08.596 --> 07:10.798
Here you go.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.866
Want to go for a drive?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.602
Yeah. Right after
you get it registered,

07:14.635 --> 07:15.836
pay the title transfer fees,

07:15.869 --> 07:18.105
get plates,
insurance.

07:18.138 --> 07:20.508
And you're gonna
need some gas.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.177
The only person more excited

07:24.211 --> 07:26.213
about me getting a car
was Greg.

07:26.246 --> 07:27.681
Oh, man, this is awesome!

07:27.715 --> 07:29.917
This isn't like
when you had your dad's car.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.084
This car's yours.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.186
We can go to the
shore to get girls,

07:33.220 --> 07:34.788
we can drive into
Manhattan to get girls,

07:34.822 --> 07:36.957
we can go to Coney
Island to get girls.

07:36.990 --> 07:41.128
You do realize it's still
gonna be us in the car, right?

07:41.161 --> 07:43.731
It doesn't matter--
cars equal girls.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.865
Every weekend and week night,

07:44.898 --> 07:46.700
this world's
gonna be our oyster.

07:46.734 --> 07:49.803
Sidekicks are always ready
to go at a moment's notice.

07:49.837 --> 07:51.839
They're never aware
of all the preparation

07:51.872 --> 07:53.707
the hero has to go through.

07:53.741 --> 07:56.810
Kemo sabe, people in that
town in big trouble.

07:56.844 --> 07:58.111
We go now.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.279
Whoa, whoa.

07:59.312 --> 08:01.248
Slow down, my eager
Indian friend.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.117
I need to get my guns,
shine my boots,

08:04.151 --> 08:06.253
feed my horse,
polish my spurs,

08:06.286 --> 08:08.288
get some bullets,
light a fire,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.658
make some coffee,
kiss a girl...

08:10.691 --> 08:12.926
And round up
the rest of the Village People.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.963
I don't know how long it's
gonna be before I can even
afford to start it up.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.131
Plus, the price of gas
is insane right now.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.867
It's, like, 85 cents a gallon.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.969
Now it's 85 cents a drop.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.904
Well, whenever you're ready...

08:23.937 --> 08:25.438
I'll be ready.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.878
What's his issue?

08:30.911 --> 08:32.880
I was finally ready
to drive my car,

08:32.913 --> 08:36.784
and it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.789
Say hello
to Uncle Remus for me.

08:41.822 --> 08:43.924
GIRL:
Hey, Chris!

08:43.957 --> 08:46.794
How you doing?

08:51.298 --> 08:53.100
* Don't worry

08:53.133 --> 08:56.003
* Be happy

08:56.036 --> 08:58.271
* Don't worry, be happy

09:02.009 --> 09:03.543
What the...?

09:05.378 --> 09:08.081
At least
I'll save money on gas.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.249
* Be happy...

09:13.320 --> 09:15.188
While Greg was ready to drive
like Jeff Gordon,

09:15.222 --> 09:18.091
I was still riding the bus
like Rosa Parks.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.361
Dude, where's our car?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.263
That sounds like
the title of a movie.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.665
Oh. I couldn't drive it--

09:24.698 --> 09:25.833
someone stole my tires
last night.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.302
:
Oh, man, I think
I'm gonna hyperventilate.

09:31.739 --> 09:34.041
So, did you call the cops?

09:34.074 --> 09:36.710
When has that ever worked
for black people?

09:36.744 --> 09:39.046
Was there money in the tires?

09:39.079 --> 09:40.113
No.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.281
A baby?

09:41.314 --> 09:43.751
A baby in the tires?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.385
You'd be surprised.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.921
Was this baby black or white?

09:47.955 --> 09:50.223
There was no baby in the tires.

09:50.257 --> 09:54.027
Well, tell me, sir, exactly
what was in the tires?

09:54.061 --> 09:55.663
Air.

09:55.696 --> 09:56.730
White air?

09:56.764 --> 09:58.065
White air?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.266
You'd be surprised.

09:59.299 --> 10:02.069
All right, fill this out,
and we'll see what we can do.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.204
Well, should I move it
so I don't get a ticket?

10:04.237 --> 10:05.706
Don't bother.

10:05.739 --> 10:06.907
Too late.

10:11.144 --> 10:15.115
Sometimes when my dad was at
work and the kids were asleep,

10:15.148 --> 10:19.052
my mom did something that
no one in the house knew about.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.188
She smoked.

10:40.007 --> 10:43.043
Where are my cigarettes?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.211
The problem
with losing something

10:44.244 --> 10:45.713
you're not supposed to have

10:45.746 --> 10:48.048
is you can't tell
anybody you lost it.

10:51.351 --> 10:53.053
Oh, excuse me, Officer.

10:53.086 --> 10:54.988
I'd like to file a report

10:55.022 --> 10:56.890
about some missing crack.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.028
I know they were in here.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.768
Did you find
my cigarettes, Julius?

11:16.443 --> 11:18.078
Daily Race Form?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.247
My mom said my dad
couldn't bet on the numbers.

11:20.280 --> 11:23.884
She never said anything about
those numbers being on horses.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.219
Even though
I couldn't drive my car,

11:26.253 --> 11:27.387
I could still enjoy it.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.358
I could listen
to music that I liked.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.026
*

11:33.060 --> 11:37.364
I could adjust the seat
the way I wanted it.

11:37.397 --> 11:40.100
Best of all,
when I was in my car,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.935
nobody could bother me.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.237
Boy, get out
of that car.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.472
It's getting late.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.413
Meanwhile, my mother wasn't
the only one hiding a secret.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.288
The only place his money could
be hidden better was Pakistan.

12:05.826 --> 12:07.060
My form.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.428
Where's my race form?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.066
Drew.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.403
Hello?

12:16.436 --> 12:18.071
My father was like the police.

12:18.105 --> 12:19.439
He entered, then knocked.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.952
Even though
I couldn't drive my car,

12:31.985 --> 12:34.955
it still felt pretty good
being a car owner.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.289
Oh, no!

12:36.323 --> 12:38.025
My school books.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.060
I learned that people
will break into a car

12:40.093 --> 12:41.061
to steal anything.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.095
Ahh!

12:47.467 --> 12:48.435
Ooh.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.469
Look, a brick.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.248
I told you a car was
a big responsibility.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.850
What did they
take this time?

13:02.883 --> 13:04.985
They took the radio,
a box of tissues,

13:05.018 --> 13:07.220
one sneaker and the
ashes in the ashtray.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.521
They took the ashtray?

13:08.555 --> 13:10.824
No, the ashes in the ashtray.

13:10.858 --> 13:11.859
The ashtray's
still in there.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.193
Got it. Anything else?

13:13.226 --> 13:14.194
Yeah,

13:14.227 --> 13:15.362
my homework.
and textbooks.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.496
Why would
they steal those?

13:16.529 --> 13:19.299
They take them and sell them
in the white neighborhoods.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.902
Along with aqua socks
and yoga mats.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.470
So what I'll do now?

13:23.503 --> 13:26.006
Fill out this form and
we'll see what we can do.

13:26.039 --> 13:28.008
Which means, "Now that
you've wasted my time,

13:28.041 --> 13:29.509
allow me to waste
some of yours."

13:29.542 --> 13:32.145
Back at school,
I was showing up later

13:32.179 --> 13:35.348
than a black man
at a custody hearing.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.483
Dude, you're really late.

13:36.516 --> 13:38.151
This isn't a custody
hearing, you know.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.519
I know. You won't
believe what happened.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.088
Somebody broke into your car

13:41.121 --> 13:42.155
and stole your textbooks
and homework?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.190
Here.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.158
Where'd you find these?

13:45.192 --> 13:47.027
I didn't find them.
I bought them.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.429
I was trying to get some bootleg
college textbooks from this guy

13:49.462 --> 13:51.464
and he offered to throw
these in for half price.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.100
You owe me ten bucks.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.935
Well, you're gonna have
to wait because I'm broke.

13:54.968 --> 13:56.369
I mean, I never
imagined having a car

13:56.403 --> 13:57.504
would be this much trouble.

13:57.537 --> 13:59.039
I've haven't even
driven it yet

13:59.072 --> 14:00.207
and it's costing
me a fortune.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.374
I'm just gonna
get rid of it.

14:01.408 --> 14:03.310
What

14:03.343 --> 14:04.377
You can't do that.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.412
What about the girls?

14:05.445 --> 14:07.047
What about
Coney Island?

14:07.080 --> 14:08.916
Greg, my car doesn't
even have tires.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.317
Dude, that
doesn't matter.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.219
If you're giving up
on this car, it means

14:12.252 --> 14:13.921
you're giving up on me,
and that's not happening.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.289
Kiss my ascot!

14:16.323 --> 14:17.524
It had taken longer
than I thought,

14:17.557 --> 14:21.161
but I finally had everything
I needed to hit the road.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.195
Thanks for the loan, Doc.

14:22.229 --> 14:23.330
I figured it's worth it.

14:23.363 --> 14:27.134
I get a reliable ride and
a driver when I need it.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.336
Oh, I'll take you
wherever you want to go.
As long as

14:29.369 --> 14:30.503
you don't want to go anywhere.

14:30.537 --> 14:31.504
Let's roll.

14:35.175 --> 14:36.209
What's the matter?

14:36.243 --> 14:38.011
It won't start.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.680
Looks like you out of gas.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.549
But the tank was full.

14:42.582 --> 14:43.951
Well...

14:43.984 --> 14:45.352
I see the problem.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.421
Looks like you getting siphoned.

14:54.727 --> 14:58.231
I would get out, but he'd
probably just rob me.

15:01.601 --> 15:02.970
Later, I went and got gas

15:03.003 --> 15:06.639
and now I really had everything
I needed to get on the road.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.212
Everything except a car.

15:19.152 --> 15:20.988
The cops got used
to coming to my house

15:21.021 --> 15:22.255
more than O.J. and Nicole's.

15:22.289 --> 15:23.623
It was right there.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.125
Was there money in it?

15:25.158 --> 15:26.126
No.

15:26.159 --> 15:27.294
A baby?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.996
No! There was no
money and no baby.

15:29.029 --> 15:30.130
It was just my car.

15:30.163 --> 15:34.234
"No... money... no...

15:34.267 --> 15:36.003
baby...

15:36.036 --> 15:39.006
just... car..."

15:39.039 --> 15:40.440
Are you just gonna
stand there and write,

15:40.473 --> 15:42.309
or are you gonna
do something?

15:51.484 --> 15:52.719
Do something?

15:52.752 --> 15:53.720
Yeah.

15:53.753 --> 15:55.722
Tell you what.

15:55.755 --> 15:58.358
You got copies of your...

15:58.391 --> 16:00.460
Registration?

16:00.493 --> 16:03.196
Yeah, I'll be right back.

16:06.666 --> 16:10.170
"Do something."

16:10.203 --> 16:11.638
Yeah, we'll get right on it.

16:20.413 --> 16:21.448
Cigarettes?

16:21.481 --> 16:24.217
Careful-- they may
complicate your pregnancy.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.229
Chris!

16:38.698 --> 16:40.100
Hey, baby.

16:41.434 --> 16:42.569
Hey, Ma.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.344
By dinnertime,
that pack of cigarettes

16:51.378 --> 16:52.745
was burning
a hole in my pocket.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.148
Hey, Ma, I found this pack
of cigarettes in my drawer.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.549
Cigarettes?
Yeah, I don't
know whose they are,

16:56.583 --> 16:58.585
but they're not mine,
and I don't want to get

16:58.618 --> 17:00.387
in trouble for it,
so here you go.

17:00.420 --> 17:02.155
Not mine.
They're not mine.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.326
Why is everybody looking at me?

17:06.359 --> 17:07.527
Because you're smoking a carrot.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.265
All right, all right, all right!
They're mine!

17:13.400 --> 17:14.534
You smoke?

17:14.567 --> 17:15.735
Ma, the surgeon general
says you can't...

17:15.768 --> 17:18.205
I know what he says. It's
written on the side of the box.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.673
Then how come you still smoke?

17:20.707 --> 17:23.343
Yeah. If there was a sign
on the side of our dinner

17:23.376 --> 17:25.212
that says it will cause
cancer and birth defects,

17:25.245 --> 17:26.646
you would slap
the salad out of us

17:26.679 --> 17:27.780
if you found
us eating it.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.349
Well, I get stressed out.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.350
Oh, well,

17:30.383 --> 17:31.284
we won't get out stressed at all

17:31.318 --> 17:33.220
when you have to get
your lungs removed.

17:33.253 --> 17:34.554
CHRIS:
Yeah, like when Dad

17:34.587 --> 17:36.423
had the gout and...
Okay, fine,
fine, fine.

17:36.456 --> 17:37.324
I quit.

17:37.357 --> 17:39.359
Ironically, smoking
caused my mother

17:39.392 --> 17:41.261
a lot more stress
than not smoking.

17:41.294 --> 17:42.462
See?

17:42.495 --> 17:43.563
Happy now?

17:43.596 --> 17:45.698
How long have you
been hiding this?

17:45.732 --> 17:47.800
Me?

17:47.834 --> 17:50.570
Well, how long have
you been hiding this?

17:50.603 --> 17:51.404
Dad, you been gambling?

17:51.438 --> 17:52.472
DREW:
You know how

17:52.505 --> 17:54.407
Ma feels about that.
Mmm.

17:54.441 --> 17:57.544
Yeah? We'll see how she
feels about this.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.812
Ooh. You have a naked

17:59.846 --> 18:02.249
No, Drew has
a naked-lady pen.

18:02.282 --> 18:05.518
Secretly, he was happy
it wasn't a naked-man pen.

18:05.552 --> 18:06.619
Oh, no. We gotta talk.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.620
Wait a minute.

18:07.654 --> 18:09.156
I still don't
understand how

18:09.189 --> 18:10.657
the pack of cigarettes
got in my drawer.

18:10.690 --> 18:11.724
Well, I didn't put them there.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.492
Neither did I.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.626
Me neither.

18:15.862 --> 18:17.830
Ooh.
Tonya, if
you were

18:17.864 --> 18:19.599
smoking so
help me...
Mama, I wasn't smoking.

18:19.632 --> 18:21.568
I was going through your
stuff and I found them

18:21.601 --> 18:23.736
and Daddy almost caught me,
so I hid them in Chris's room

18:23.770 --> 18:25.372
so h would get in
trouble instead of me.

18:25.405 --> 18:26.739
How did you get my racing form?

18:26.773 --> 18:28.575
Well, I was going
through your stuff

18:28.608 --> 18:29.376
looking for my stuff.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.643
How did you find my pen?

18:30.677 --> 18:32.379
I thought you had
my racing form.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.280
And how'd you find

18:33.313 --> 18:34.447
those cigarettes anyway?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.615
Cause you put them

18:35.648 --> 18:36.816
in my drawer.
Mmm.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.818
You see, this is your fault.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.453
You were in there
doing something

18:40.487 --> 18:41.788
that you ain't had
no business doing.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.890
and the next thing you know,
nobody's business

18:43.923 --> 18:45.192
is everybody' business.

18:46.426 --> 18:48.228
Are you gonna
put me on punishment?

18:48.261 --> 18:50.163
Is that your business? No!

18:50.197 --> 18:51.464
You'll find out
what happens to you

18:51.498 --> 18:53.600
when it happens to
you. Now go upstairs.

18:56.569 --> 19:00.273
After Tonya got busted,
the cops finally found my car.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.842
Unfortunately,
it was a lost cause.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.947
They even stole the paint?!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.349
I'm sorry, Chris.
Tell you what.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.517
Since you seem
like a nice kid.

19:10.550 --> 19:11.718
I'll give you $50 for it.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.320
I could use it
for scrap metal.

19:13.353 --> 19:15.688
Well... I guess

19:15.722 --> 19:17.624
it's better than nothing. Deal.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.859
But since you owe me $40
for the tow, I'll give you $10.

19:19.892 --> 19:20.627
$11.00.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.594
$10.50.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.562
$10.75.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.730
Deal.

19:27.934 --> 19:31.471
Oh, yeah. You got some, uh,
some cans and junk in the trunk.

19:31.504 --> 19:32.672
You want any of it?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.242
Too late.
JLo's already got it.

19:35.275 --> 19:36.509
Nah. What's the point?

19:36.543 --> 19:37.644
You can have it.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.979
All right.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.848
At the end of the day,
I ended up

19:41.881 --> 19:43.650
paying $300
for my first car,

19:43.683 --> 19:47.987
I never got to drive it,
but I was taken for a ride.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.422
Now, here's a feel-good story

19:49.456 --> 19:51.258
we like to call
"Junkyard Treasure."

19:51.291 --> 19:54.994
It happened this afternoon
when this man, Miguel Rodriguez,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.464
the manager of an impound
lot in Bed-Stuy,

19:57.497 --> 20:01.468
found $5,000 in the trunk
of an old Camaro.
What?!

20:01.501 --> 20:03.636
I bought the car off
some kid for $10.75.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.306
Eh? An-and I asked him if he
wanted anything in the trunk,

20:06.339 --> 20:07.474
and he told me to keep it.

20:07.507 --> 20:09.809
So I looked inside this little
can and found I $5,000!

20:09.842 --> 20:12.279
Ain't this about a...!

20:12.312 --> 20:14.547
* Everybody hates Chris.
