01:11.767 --> 01:14.934
Kevin,
You scared me.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.100
It's becoming
Your thing.

01:16.167 --> 01:17.767
Well, maybe you
Scare too easily.

01:17.834 --> 01:20.434
What-
What's this?

01:20.501 --> 01:22.801
Oh. Uh, Since you
couldn't Make it to dinner,

01:22.868 --> 01:25.801
I thought i would
Bring dinner to you.

01:25.868 --> 01:28.534
Oh, kevin.

01:28.601 --> 01:30.467
Oh.

01:30.534 --> 01:31.968
Want to start
With dessert?

01:33.701 --> 01:36.634
Oh, i always said
I wanted to try this

01:36.701 --> 01:38.901
When i was a grown-up.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.701
Mm...

01:42.133 --> 01:43.734

Too stressed out.

01:43.801 --> 01:45.200
What?

01:45.267 --> 01:46.534
You're too
Stressed out.

01:46.601 --> 01:48.033
You didn't like that?

01:48.100 --> 01:49.367
No. That's why you
Scare so easily.

01:49.434 --> 01:50.868
You're so stressed.

01:50.934 --> 01:52.534
I have
A stressful job.

01:52.601 --> 01:54.067
You know, maybe
We should get away.

01:54.133 --> 01:56.400
You mean, Like a vacation? Yeah. Yeah.

01:56.467 --> 01:59.133
You deserve a week In
the land Of no keyboards.

01:59.200 --> 02:01.267
I don't know what
I'd do with myself.

02:01.334 --> 02:05.667
Well, i can think of
A couple things.

02:05.734 --> 02:07.467
Oh,

02:07.534 --> 02:11.567
That is something else
I have always wanted to try.

02:11.634 --> 02:15.901
Mm, oh, my husband
Would kill us both.

02:15.968 --> 02:19.767
No. Don't think
Of him.

02:19.834 --> 02:22.100
Oh...

02:22.167 --> 02:23.868
Oh.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.467
Oh... oh...

02:25.534 --> 02:26.868
Muy linda.
Oh, my-

02:26.934 --> 02:28.968
Preciosa.
Oh, my god.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.434
Hermosa.
Oh, god...

02:31.501 --> 02:32.701
Oh, my god.

02:38.901 --> 02:40.667
Oh, god.

02:43.734 --> 02:47.300
Charles luvet was found floating
In a miami marina last night.

02:47.367 --> 02:50.467
Local m. e. Thinks that He was
only in the water About an hour.

02:50.534 --> 02:51.834
Any attempt
To weigh the body down?

02:51.901 --> 02:53.334
Doesn't
Appear to be.

02:53.400 --> 02:54.734
Well, the dumping
Could be convenient,

02:54.801 --> 02:56.300
As a opposed to a means
Of hiding the crime.

02:56.367 --> 02:59.200
Well, he's the third victim Found
in miami over The last 2 months.

02:59.267 --> 03:01.067
Though the locations
Of the bodies are different,

03:01.133 --> 03:03.000
Many of the elements are
The same-all males,

03:03.067 --> 03:06.200
25 to 35, all traveling,
All asphyxiated

03:06.267 --> 03:08.667
With no signs
Of sexual assault.

03:08.734 --> 03:10.667
But tourists Could
be just Simple robbery.

03:10.734 --> 03:12.400
Well, there are some
Personal items missing.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.734
He's targeting Travelers For a reason.

03:14.801 --> 03:16.133
I am so sorry.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.701
Hey,
Half-day today?

03:17.767 --> 03:20.801
The alarm, sir. I
overslept. I'm so sorry.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.501
Everyone's allowed
To be late... once.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.000
It won't
Happen again.

03:24.067 --> 03:26.868
You guys Notice the
red flag On the autopsy report?

03:26.934 --> 03:28.968
Yeah. None Of the hyoid
bones Were fractured.

03:29.033 --> 03:31.300
No visual signs of trauma.
No ligature marks.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.767
Yet the unsub still managed
To asphyxiate grown men.

03:33.834 --> 03:35.300
Maybe a chokehold,

03:35.367 --> 03:36.834
Wouldn't leave
Any signs of trauma.

03:36.901 --> 03:38.367
It would also be a way
Of controlling a male.

03:38.434 --> 03:41.467
A powerful grip from behind
Gives the unsub All the leverage.

03:41.534 --> 03:43.334
None of these victims Look
out-of-shape Or easy to control.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.133
In fact, they all look
Remarkably fit.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.567
J.j.: well, as i said, The recovery
locations Are very different.

03:48.634 --> 03:50.167
Charles luvet was found
In the water.

03:50.234 --> 03:52.801
Daniel brown was Partially
buried in A shallow sand dune.

03:52.868 --> 03:55.100
Paul hayes was stuffed
Into a dumpster.

03:55.167 --> 03:57.234
Prentiss: that's not much Of
an effort to hide Any of them.

03:57.300 --> 03:59.367
They were all found
In high-traffic areas.

03:59.434 --> 04:00.734
J.j.: miami p. d.
Is asking for our help,

04:00.801 --> 04:03.434
Considering There are
currently 4 other men missing

04:03.501 --> 04:05.167
That match
This victimology.

04:05.234 --> 04:07.501
I can dig up What i can on the
victims From their hometowns.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.534
Miami is a mecca
For potential targets,

04:09.601 --> 04:12.534
And anyone traveling Is more
vulnerable Than they normally would be.

04:12.601 --> 04:15.300
Case in point
- Charles luvet, The latest victim,

04:15.367 --> 04:16.868
He was
A vacationing cop.

04:54.834 --> 04:56.400
J.j.: "there are no secrets
Better kept

04:56.467 --> 04:58.901
Than the secrets
That everybody guesses. "

04:58.968 --> 05:00.367
George bernard shaw.

05:03.601 --> 05:07.701
Reid: ugh... agh. Is it always This hot?

05:09.467 --> 05:11.067
Every day, all day.

05:11.133 --> 05:12.567
That's south beach.

05:12.634 --> 05:13.901
That's not what
I'm talking about.

05:13.968 --> 05:15.000
They know.

05:15.067 --> 05:17.901
Fbi.
Yes.

05:17.968 --> 05:20.200
Detective lopez,

05:33.067 --> 05:35.601
Rossi, derek,
And dr. Reid.

05:35.667 --> 05:37.901
Well, i hope there's no test,
'Cause i'm lousy with names.

05:37.968 --> 05:40.434
Agent
Will be fine.

05:40.501 --> 05:42.567
Hey,
Isn't that-

05:42.634 --> 05:45.734
Lopez: detective lamontagne
Just arrived from new orleans

05:45.801 --> 05:48.567
To i. d. The cop they pulled
From the bay last night.

05:48.634 --> 05:51.067
Detective,
It's good to see you.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.501
How are you? Yeah.

05:53.567 --> 05:55.534
Uh, charlie luvet And i
worked Together for 7 years.

05:55.601 --> 05:57.634
We haven't formally
I.d. ed him yet,

05:57.701 --> 06:00.534
But we believe it's him.

06:00.601 --> 06:02.300
Sorry for
Your loss, man.

06:02.367 --> 06:04.000
So, you all
Know each other?

06:04.067 --> 06:06.968
Professionally.

06:07.033 --> 06:11.634
Yeah. The, uh, B.a. u. Helped me
out On a case about a year ago.

06:11.701 --> 06:14.200
But just For the sake of clarity,
I'm not here to investigate.

06:14.267 --> 06:17.701
Charlie was, um, supposed
To be married this august,

06:17.767 --> 06:20.467
So if the guy That floated
up Last night was him,

06:20.534 --> 06:24.434
I guess i have the honor
Of notifying his fiancÃ©e,

06:24.501 --> 06:26.501
So she's gonna need
Some answers, closure,

06:26.567 --> 06:28.167
And i'm just here
To get that for her.

06:28.234 --> 06:29.868
Do you know
Why he was here?

06:29.934 --> 06:31.901
He was meeting up
With some college buddies

06:31.968 --> 06:33.300
To compete
In a regatta.

06:33.367 --> 06:35.334
He was a big boat guy.

06:35.400 --> 06:36.501
So, he wasn't
Traveling alone.

06:36.567 --> 06:39.167
Well, he came alone.
He was meeting them here.

06:39.234 --> 06:42.834
We should track These friends
down, see If they saw anything.

06:42.901 --> 06:45.934
And the 2 other victims,
Any potential witnesses?

06:46.000 --> 06:48.334
No. Paul hayes
Was here alone on business.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.934
Daniel brown came down
To windsurf by himself.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.534
So, they were all
Essentially alone.

06:52.601 --> 06:54.534
The unsub watched them
Long enough to know that.

06:54.601 --> 06:57.267
Yeah. He's probably Already
scoping out His next victim,

06:57.334 --> 06:59.434
And i don't have A damn
thing To warn people with,

06:59.501 --> 07:01.567
So come on inside. I got
everything All set up.

07:03.167 --> 07:04.400
How are you?
Lamontagne.

07:04.467 --> 07:05.667
Good to see you.

07:10.801 --> 07:12.234
Lamontagne:
Hey, wait up.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.868
What was that?

07:15.934 --> 07:17.968
What was what?

07:18.033 --> 07:19.234
"professionally"?

07:21.167 --> 07:25.067
Hey, you still haven't
Told 'em about us?

07:25.133 --> 07:27.133
It's none
Of their business.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.634
Where do you tell them
You go every weekend?

07:29.701 --> 07:30.701
I don't.

07:30.767 --> 07:35.000
Wait. So are-are you
Ashamed or something?

07:35.067 --> 07:38.334
What? No. No.

07:38.400 --> 07:41.167
It's just
In this team,

07:41.234 --> 07:43.000
Everyone Knows
everything About everyone.

07:43.067 --> 07:44.367
There's no privacy.

07:44.434 --> 07:45.868
My personal life is
One less thing

07:45.934 --> 07:47.033
They can profile,
All right?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.567
We should Get up there. Yeah.

07:48.634 --> 07:50.000
Wouldn't want your team To
think something's up, Would we?

07:50.067 --> 07:52.200
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Please don't Do this, ok?

07:52.267 --> 07:54.367
You realize that This is
gonna happen Every now and then

07:54.434 --> 07:56.367
When our career paths
Cross, right?

07:56.434 --> 07:58.133
Doesn't make it
Any less awkward.

07:59.601 --> 08:02.601
Wow. Never realized
How much awkward

08:02.667 --> 08:04.467
Could sound like ashamed.

08:08.267 --> 08:13.434
Lopez: this is Everything we
recovered From paul hayes' hotel room.

08:13.501 --> 08:16.434
It's all been processed, So don't
worry about Touching anything.

08:16.501 --> 08:17.834
Thank you.

08:17.901 --> 08:21.000
I'm gonna take The skinny kid
and derek To the dumpsites,

08:21.067 --> 08:22.767
So i got my cell,
Radio.

08:22.834 --> 08:25.000
If anyone doesn't give you
Anything, just call me.

08:25.067 --> 08:26.100
Great.

08:29.834 --> 08:32.567
She did say
She wasn't good at names.

08:32.634 --> 08:33.601
Remembered derek.

08:33.667 --> 08:35.567
Wonder how
She'll describe us.

08:35.634 --> 08:38.900
Oh, i am sure i
Don't want to know.

08:38.967 --> 08:41.567
Oh, it's always sad Seeing
someone's Life reduced

08:41.634 --> 08:43.967
To the things They had
with them When they died.

08:44.033 --> 08:46.033
It's just so clear
They didn't know

08:46.100 --> 08:48.667
How short
Their time would be.

08:48.734 --> 08:51.501
Odd.
Odd?

08:51.567 --> 08:54.000
His wife reported
That he'd been down here

08:54.067 --> 08:55.567
Almost a week
On business.

08:55.634 --> 08:58.567
Yet he never wore any
Of the suits he packed.

08:58.634 --> 09:01.300
Hmm, and there
Are appointments

09:01.367 --> 09:03.400
Going back 6 months
In his p. d.a.,

09:03.467 --> 09:06.767
But nothing is Listed
for the week He was here.

09:08.133 --> 09:11.100
Hayes was wearing Running
clothes When he was killed.

09:11.167 --> 09:14.234
Who takes off
Their wedding ring to jog?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.567
Yeah.

09:24.934 --> 09:27.400
That's him.
That's charlie luvet.

09:27.467 --> 09:29.868
Woman: we had to i. d. More than
the photo Before we could ship him.

09:29.934 --> 09:31.767
You're not family, But i
can cut through The red tape.

09:31.834 --> 09:32.901
Thank you.

09:32.968 --> 09:35.601
If you need help
Making arrangements,

09:35.667 --> 09:38.067
Uh, liaising with families
Is part of what i do.

09:38.133 --> 09:39.701
I might just
Take you up on that.

09:39.767 --> 09:42.901
Excuse me.
I'll be outside.

09:52.033 --> 09:54.300
Paul hayes was found
In a dumpster over there.

09:54.367 --> 09:57.501
Hey, i think these guys
Knew the unsub.

09:57.567 --> 09:58.968
What makes you
Say that?

09:59.033 --> 10:00.734
Where you're A fish out of
water, You look to the locals

10:00.801 --> 10:02.234
For where to eat,
Where to shop.

10:02.300 --> 10:04.200
What path to run. Yeah.
Why would he kill them

10:04.267 --> 10:06.033
And then risk dragging
Their body across the beach?

10:06.100 --> 10:09.133
He wouldn't. They were already Out here.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.634
So they've already
Dusted for prints.

10:11.701 --> 10:14.934
I sure would feel better If
we found his gun And shield.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.767
I'm thinking if somebody
Tried to grab him up here,

10:16.834 --> 10:18.801
He might have left them
Behind, you know?

10:18.868 --> 10:20.667
Charlie left the hotel
Voluntarily.

10:20.734 --> 10:22.334
What makes you
Say that?

10:22.400 --> 10:24.667
'Cause we'd know If the
valet had His car downstairs.

10:24.734 --> 10:27.300
This is a receipt For a
mercury sable He rented.

10:27.367 --> 10:29.467
You know, Most rental
cars have Locators in 'em.

10:29.534 --> 10:32.200
I'll call garcia, See if she can
find out Where it is right now.

10:34.000 --> 10:36.434
Don't.

10:39.100 --> 10:40.701
Standing in
My dead partner's room,

10:40.767 --> 10:44.133
And you think I'm in the
mood For grab-ass, huh?

10:46.501 --> 10:47.767
What's that?

10:47.834 --> 10:50.334
Plastic i. d. Bracelet.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.534
11257 on it.

10:53.601 --> 10:56.033
I'm guessing
It's for the regatta.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.701
Hey, i'm sorry.

11:03.400 --> 11:05.734
Mi puo indicare

11:05.801 --> 11:08.367
Il fegato
Sulla cartina?

11:09.834 --> 11:12.634
You just asked me To show you
where Your liver is on a map.

11:12.701 --> 11:13.968
Did i?

11:14.033 --> 11:16.067
Pretty sure
"il fegato" is liver.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.734
Oh, try this one.

11:18.801 --> 11:22.567
"vorrei una camera

11:22.634 --> 11:26.033
Con letto matrimoniale. "

11:26.100 --> 11:27.467
Hmm, what
Does that mean?

11:27.534 --> 11:30.701
"i'd like to book
A room with a double bed. "

11:30.767 --> 11:32.200
Oh, jinkies,

11:32.267 --> 11:34.033
Even lechery sounds
Better in italian.

11:37.300 --> 11:40.067
Buon giorno,
Signor hotchner.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.367
You are correct.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.767
Most rentals do have
A locator system in them.

11:43.834 --> 11:45.434
Got it.

11:45.501 --> 11:48.601
I'm sure I can have this
car Located in a jiff.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.434
Prego.

11:51.567 --> 11:53.868
All clear, detective.
Thanks, guys.

11:53.934 --> 11:55.434
This garcia girl
Of yours is good.

11:55.501 --> 11:57.033
That's
An understatement

11:57.100 --> 11:59.300
Hey, you can't go Wrong with
a latina At the controls.

11:59.367 --> 12:02.300
Yeah. That's my girl,
But, uh, she's not nearly

12:02.367 --> 12:04.067
As latino
As the name sounds.

12:08.033 --> 12:09.467
If i'm gonna
Kill someone,

12:09.534 --> 12:12.868
Taking them out on A boat
would give me The most privacy.

12:12.934 --> 12:15.334
Then there's Harbor
masters And videotapes,

12:15.400 --> 12:17.501
But that's-i mean, That
will take weeks To get back,

12:17.567 --> 12:18.834
And we don't have
Weeks, right?

12:18.901 --> 12:21.000
No, we sure don't. You
got the keys, Don't you?

12:21.067 --> 12:23.367
Oh, yeah. Go ahead And start it up.

12:27.200 --> 12:31.334
Well, there is one good thing About
these victims Being on vacation.

12:31.400 --> 12:33.167
When you're alone
In a strange place,

12:33.234 --> 12:34.701
You got a rent-a-car,

12:34.767 --> 12:36.200
What's the one thing
That you need?

12:36.267 --> 12:38.033
A g. p.s.
That's right.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.701
Normally, when you
Return these things,

12:39.767 --> 12:41.601
They wipe
This stuff clean,

12:41.667 --> 12:45.067
So that right there

12:45.133 --> 12:47.100
Has to be the last place
Charlie needed to go.

12:48.334 --> 12:49.367
Really?

12:51.033 --> 12:52.267
What, you know it?

12:52.334 --> 12:53.968
That's not possible.

12:54.033 --> 12:55.734
Come on. I think i would
know If there's a regatta

12:55.801 --> 12:57.400
Happening this weekend
At my own club.

12:57.467 --> 12:59.434
Our regatta is held
In september.

12:59.501 --> 13:02.234
But he said-
And i'm sorry,

13:02.300 --> 13:04.868
But we wouldn't use A plastic
bracelet like This for participants.

13:04.934 --> 13:07.634
Our entry fee
Is $10,000.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.534
Good luck.

13:11.968 --> 13:13.300
You're sure
That's what he said?

13:13.367 --> 13:14.834
Comes here
Every year for it.

13:14.901 --> 13:16.501
It's what he does
On his annual furlough.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.000
Morgan.

13:20.067 --> 13:22.267
Yeah. I just Got an address
out of Charlie luvet's rental.

13:22.334 --> 13:23.901
It's to a bar
In south beach-

13:23.968 --> 13:26.067
11257 palm drive.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.567
It's a gay bar, hotch.

13:28.634 --> 13:29.901
I don't think Charlie
luvet was Ever out here

13:29.968 --> 13:31.000
To meet friends
For a race.

13:31.067 --> 13:33.400
We'll have to rethink
Our victimology.

13:49.868 --> 13:51.968
Better watch yourself
In the sun.

13:52.033 --> 13:54.267
You know what they say. All
the exposure Can kill you.

13:56.834 --> 13:58.601
Suntan to death.

14:00.300 --> 14:03.534
Well, i guess there's
Worse ways to die.

14:03.601 --> 14:04.801
As someone with
Firsthand experience,

14:04.868 --> 14:06.567
I can tell you
That is true.

14:06.634 --> 14:08.601
Firsthand experience?

14:08.667 --> 14:10.367
Yeah. I'm a police
officer In new orleans.

14:10.434 --> 14:13.567
A cop. Really?

14:15.367 --> 14:17.467
Well,
That's impressive.

14:17.534 --> 14:20.000
Where are you from?
Texas.

14:20.067 --> 14:23.367
Well, you know, They say
things Are bigger there.

14:23.434 --> 14:25.934
Oh.

14:26.000 --> 14:29.167
Well, i don't know
Anything about that, officer,

14:29.234 --> 14:32.868
But, um, how about I buy you a
drink, And we can talk about it?

14:32.934 --> 14:34.834
You're not here With anyone? Nope.

14:34.901 --> 14:36.968
Came down to miami
All by my lonesome.

14:37.033 --> 14:38.634
Look at that.
Me, too.

14:38.701 --> 14:39.801
I'm deac.

14:39.868 --> 14:41.634
Charlie.

14:41.701 --> 14:44.033
Name's charlie-
Charlie luvet.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.367
For you.

14:54.434 --> 14:56.033
Oh, thank you.
You read my mind.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.534
I don't understand How it can
be this dry When it's this humid.

14:58.601 --> 15:00.868
Mmm.

15:00.934 --> 15:02.300
Sweat All your fluids Out outside

15:02.367 --> 15:04.601
And then come Into
bone-dry Air conditioning.

15:04.667 --> 15:07.434
Well, then if i could Just hook
this up To an i. v., then...

15:09.367 --> 15:11.000
At least we have
Something fun To look at,

15:11.067 --> 15:12.400
Keep us on our toes.

15:12.467 --> 15:13.534
What do you mean?

15:13.601 --> 15:16.534
Lamontagne.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.667
You think so, huh?

15:20.734 --> 15:22.133
Don't you?

15:24.467 --> 15:25.734
Yeah. I guess he's-

15:28.400 --> 15:30.067
He has a thing.

15:30.133 --> 15:31.501
Definitely a thing.

15:33.601 --> 15:34.567
Detective, is that
The case file?

15:34.634 --> 15:36.133
Yeah.

15:36.200 --> 15:37.167
Thanks.

15:37.234 --> 15:40.567
How'd i not know
Charlie was gay?

15:40.634 --> 15:42.601
Because he didn't
Want you to know.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.167
Flew hundreds of miles
Just to be someone else.

15:45.234 --> 15:48.434
No. He flew hundreds
Of miles to be himself.

15:48.501 --> 15:51.467
What do i tell
His fiancÃ©e?

15:51.534 --> 15:52.868
The truth.

15:54.133 --> 15:55.334
Lopez: all right,
Everybody. Listen up.

15:55.400 --> 15:58.100
The fbi has a profile
Of our guy.

15:58.167 --> 15:59.534
Ok. We want to stress
What we're about to present

15:59.601 --> 16:01.367
Is just
A preliminary profile.

16:01.434 --> 16:03.033
There may be
A time restraint here,

16:03.100 --> 16:05.133
So we just wanted
To give you what we have now.

16:05.200 --> 16:07.934
Our technical analyst,
Penelope garcia, Will start off

16:08.000 --> 16:10.834
By talking About the 4
remaining Victims still missing.

16:10.901 --> 16:11.968
2 of them
Disappeared

16:12.033 --> 16:13.300
On the same day
A few months ago,

16:13.367 --> 16:14.968
And then the third
And the fourth went missing

16:15.033 --> 16:16.300
Within the last 4 weeks.

16:16.367 --> 16:17.801
We think the unsub
Is targeting these guys

16:17.868 --> 16:19.000
On their travels.

16:19.067 --> 16:20.501
Yeah, and then when
The befriending happens,

16:20.567 --> 16:23.100
Whoosh, they vanish. However it
looks like There's a connection

16:23.167 --> 16:26.300
Between our current Victims and
the men That are still missing.

16:26.367 --> 16:29.434
See, 2 of Those 4 missing
men Were totally out,

16:29.501 --> 16:31.334
Openly gay
When they disappeared.

16:31.400 --> 16:33.534
I saw one of them
On socialcrib. net.

16:33.601 --> 16:35.200
That's
A social networking site.

16:35.267 --> 16:36.734
It had a photo
With his boyfriend.

16:36.801 --> 16:39.567
Assuming The 4 missing
men are Meeting the same unsub,

16:39.634 --> 16:41.434
It means he's killing
Almost weekly,

16:41.501 --> 16:44.534
Which also means He may have
already Chosen his next victim.

16:44.601 --> 16:46.868
Prentiss: what we need Is more
information On the movements

16:46.934 --> 16:49.634
Of our victims
Before they met the unsub.

16:49.701 --> 16:52.767
We have 3 confirmed victims
And 4 possibles.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.167
Some of our other colleagues
Are out in the community now

16:55.234 --> 16:57.400
Trying to see if anyone Remembers
anything About these men.

16:57.467 --> 17:01.200
It's also not just The fact that
our victims Were traveling alone

17:01.267 --> 17:02.834
That left them vulnerable
To the unsub.

17:02.901 --> 17:06.067
We believe they may have Been looking
specifically To meet other men.

17:06.133 --> 17:08.000
Based on the ages
Of the victims,

17:08.067 --> 17:10.233
We're looking For an offender
In his mid to late 20s.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.067
He's familiar
With the area,

17:12.133 --> 17:14.800
And he may be Offering
assistance To those who are not.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.733
Prentiss: he studies
His victims' habits.

17:16.800 --> 17:18.800
He learns
How to gain their trust.

17:18.867 --> 17:22.434
This unsub is charming,
Charismatic, intelligent.

17:22.501 --> 17:24.133
We assume he frequents
Gay establishments,

17:24.200 --> 17:25.901
But he may also work at one.

17:25.968 --> 17:27.233
And, Given the
technique With which he kills,

17:27.300 --> 17:30.334
He may have had prior
Defense tactic training.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.968
He may be a member
Of the military

17:32.067 --> 17:33.400
Or recently discharged.

17:33.467 --> 17:36.734
He steals their possessions,
But he doesn't pawn a thing.

17:36.801 --> 17:38.200
And the fact that
He's targeting gay men

17:38.267 --> 17:40.200
May mean that
This is a hate crime

17:40.267 --> 17:43.167
And/or the unsub May be
struggling With his own sexuality.

18:00.901 --> 18:04.167
Hey,
Loosen up, baby.

18:04.234 --> 18:06.200
Come on. You can
Have a little fun.

18:09.567 --> 18:12.501
Maybe-maybe you
Need another shot.

18:12.567 --> 18:14.901
You know, i'll be right back.
Whoa, whoa.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.834
Wait. Wait. Was it
Something i said?

18:19.367 --> 18:21.634
Nah. Nah, cher.

18:23.033 --> 18:25.834
Then-then what's wrong?

18:25.901 --> 18:28.200
Nothing.

18:28.267 --> 18:31.200
I just need
To get some air.

18:36.100 --> 18:39.334
Just a little time, And i'll
have some Answers for you.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.901
The best thing
That you can know

18:42.968 --> 18:47.234
Is that he loved you
Very much.

18:47.300 --> 18:49.400
All right.
Good night.

18:56.968 --> 18:59.267
Hey.

19:01.267 --> 19:02.868
Well...

19:04.434 --> 19:05.868
Sure is warm
In the bayou,

19:05.934 --> 19:07.868
But at least It cools
down some At night.

19:11.100 --> 19:13.734
Heh. Well, you leaving?

19:13.801 --> 19:15.601
Yeah. I'm-i'm beat.

19:15.667 --> 19:17.801
Without
Saying good-bye?

19:17.868 --> 19:19.634
I didn't know
Where you were.

19:19.701 --> 19:20.901
Did you look?

19:26.033 --> 19:28.834
Should i be worried?

19:28.901 --> 19:31.400
I mean, it doesn't take
A profiler to see

19:31.467 --> 19:34.167
That you got One foot out
the door In this relationship.

19:34.234 --> 19:36.167
Could you just please
Keep your voice down?

19:36.234 --> 19:38.000
I don't care
If they hear us.

19:38.067 --> 19:41.567
Hey, yo,
I'm crazy about her.

19:41.634 --> 19:43.901
You know, i-
I don't have a problem

19:43.968 --> 19:45.200
With people
Knowing about it.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.834
Well, i do.
Why?

19:46.901 --> 19:50.267
Just because,
All right?

19:50.334 --> 19:53.334
It's-all right,
It's my business.

19:55.067 --> 19:57.000
Are you ashamed
Of this?

19:57.067 --> 19:58.634
No.

19:58.701 --> 20:01.300
Did i offend you?
No.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.601
I say Something wrong? No.

20:03.667 --> 20:05.067

Y-

20:13.534 --> 20:15.501
Y- you do?

20:18.868 --> 20:20.167
Yeah.

20:25.634 --> 20:28.734
Ok.

20:28.801 --> 20:31.567
We're supposed To hop on a
plane Every weekend forever?

20:31.634 --> 20:34.634
And neither one of us
Is willing to relocate, so-

20:34.701 --> 20:36.200
When did we have
That discussion?

20:36.267 --> 20:38.901
Well, do you?
Maybe.

20:38.968 --> 20:40.901
You want to give up
Your career in new orleans

20:40.968 --> 20:42.868
So you can live
In quantico, virginia?

20:42.934 --> 20:47.567
Well, i'd at least like
To have that option.

20:47.634 --> 20:49.701
You know, look, j. j.

20:49.767 --> 20:51.934
All i'm looking for here
Is an acknowledgement

20:52.033 --> 20:54.968
To your friends
That you care about me.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.367
Why? Why is that
So important to you?

20:58.434 --> 21:00.634
Why?

21:04.667 --> 21:06.267
Have a good night, j. j.

21:10.400 --> 21:12.300
Will...

21:27.234 --> 21:28.901
Look at me.

21:30.367 --> 21:33.968
I'm breaking the law
With a cop.

21:34.033 --> 21:35.467
I wouldn't
Announce that.

21:35.534 --> 21:38.133
Mmm!

21:38.200 --> 21:40.133
I'm a bad, bad boy.

21:42.701 --> 21:44.634
I'm a badass.

21:44.701 --> 21:46.067
Hee hee hoo!

21:50.968 --> 21:53.067
Does that mean You're
gonna have To handcuff me?

21:53.133 --> 21:56.167
'Cause you can Handcuff me, If you want.

21:56.234 --> 21:57.701
Shut up.

21:57.767 --> 22:00.133
Are you a dirty cop,

22:00.200 --> 22:02.834
Huh?

22:02.901 --> 22:05.801
'Cause i like dirty.

22:05.868 --> 22:07.968
Is that what you want?
You like dirty...

22:08.033 --> 22:11.300
What are you doing?
My cop from new orleans?

22:11.367 --> 22:13.667
'Cause i can do dirty.
That what you want?

22:13.734 --> 22:15.334
Shut up and listen
To yourself.

22:15.400 --> 22:18.200
You're disgusting.
You're filthy.

22:18.267 --> 22:20.033
Jeez...

22:22.000 --> 22:23.100
Ohh...

22:24.701 --> 22:28.000
Sorry, cher. I-

22:28.067 --> 22:30.868
I didn't hurt you,
Did i, cher? I'm sorry.

22:32.734 --> 22:34.300
I thought you left.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.801
You said in the profile That the
unsub was Targeting gay males,

22:36.868 --> 22:38.133
Possibly due
To his struggles

22:38.200 --> 22:40.033
With his own sexuality, Right? Right.

22:40.100 --> 22:42.334
Well, what if the reason
Luvet let his guard down

22:42.400 --> 22:46.033
Was because he could
Finally be who he is-

22:46.100 --> 22:48.567
No-no judgments,
No fear.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.934
What if the unsub Is seeing
a freedom In his victims

22:54.000 --> 22:57.267
That he wishes
He had himself?

23:01.434 --> 23:03.601
Oh, that really hurt.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.467
"that really hurt. "

23:06.534 --> 23:09.934
That ain't funny.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.300
"that ain't funny. "

23:16.534 --> 23:18.868
What are you doing? What,
are you making fun Of me now?

23:18.934 --> 23:21.334
No, no, cher.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.200
I'm not making fun
Of you.

23:23.267 --> 23:27.367
Hey, hey, i'm sorry.

23:30.501 --> 23:31.868
I'm sorry.

23:31.934 --> 23:33.701
Sorry.

23:35.868 --> 23:37.467
For which thing?

23:40.467 --> 23:41.667
For this.

23:41.734 --> 23:43.767
Ugh!

23:54.033 --> 23:55.634
You can take him away.

23:57.901 --> 23:59.100
What have we got?

23:59.167 --> 24:01.100
Male,
The same age range,

24:01.167 --> 24:03.100
And we found
Luvet's police badge

24:03.167 --> 24:04.634
About a half a block
From here.

24:04.701 --> 24:06.334
So the unsub either
Ditched it or dropped it

24:06.400 --> 24:07.667
When he was getting away.

24:07.734 --> 24:09.234
Any sign of luvet's gun?
No.

24:09.300 --> 24:10.467
He may be
Holding on to that.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.234
Why would he kill
Out on the open like this?

24:12.300 --> 24:13.567
He's losing control
Emotionally.

24:13.634 --> 24:14.634
He could be
Devolving.

24:14.701 --> 24:16.167
Leaving the body
Out in plain sight?

24:16.234 --> 24:17.334
It's-it's off pattern.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.501
Lopez: he was
Interrupted.

24:18.567 --> 24:19.767
Who interrupted him?

24:21.100 --> 24:23.968
Bring him over.
Busboy from the bar.

24:24.033 --> 24:26.667
Mijito, these are The fbi
people That i told you about,

24:26.734 --> 24:30.000
So just tell them
Everything you saw.

24:30.067 --> 24:31.167
All right. Well,
I came out here

24:31.234 --> 24:32.934
On my break
To have a smoke,

24:33.000 --> 24:35.734
And that guy was On the
ground, and His friend said-

24:35.801 --> 24:37.000
His friend?

24:37.067 --> 24:38.501
Yeah. His friend Said that
they had Just been mugged.

24:38.567 --> 24:40.667
You spoke to this guy?
No, ma'am. I tried.

24:40.734 --> 24:42.667
But he did say
That he was a cop.

24:42.734 --> 24:45.167
So he took off, and he
Chased after those guys.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.133
Could you give A description
of this cop To a sketch artist?

24:47.200 --> 24:49.367
No. I can't.

24:49.434 --> 24:52.033
I mean, he was A white guy,
but it was Pretty dark out here,

24:52.100 --> 24:54.367
And he basically Kept running
away From me the whole time.

24:54.434 --> 24:56.901
I'm gonna have to get
All your information.

24:56.968 --> 24:58.734
Yeah, sure.
Just come with me.

24:58.801 --> 25:00.834
So this guy is
Impersonating luvet?

25:00.901 --> 25:02.634
Could just be a ruse
He used to get away.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.968
But if he is Impersonating
His victims, why?

25:05.033 --> 25:06.234
Transference.

25:06.300 --> 25:07.901
Whatever he sees
In his victims,

25:07.968 --> 25:09.067
He wants
For himself.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.033
He hates
Who he is.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.534
He's targeting
Tourists

25:12.601 --> 25:14.534
Because he sees them As
living a kind Of lie, too.

25:14.601 --> 25:16.567
Could be suffering
From cluster "b. "

25:16.634 --> 25:17.901
Cluster "b"?

25:17.968 --> 25:19.601
A cluster of
Personality disorders.

25:19.667 --> 25:23.267
It's also called The erratic,
dramatic Emotional cluster,

25:23.334 --> 25:25.434
An enduring pattern Of
inner experience And behavior

25:25.501 --> 25:26.934
That differentiates Itself
markedly from The expectations

25:27.000 --> 25:28.767
Of the individual's
Culture.

25:28.834 --> 25:31.067
It manifests itself-
This guy's a sick dude.

25:31.133 --> 25:33.601
Prentiss: but something Triggers
his constant Need to escape.

25:33.667 --> 25:35.434
It could be
Drugs, sex,

25:35.501 --> 25:37.200
Something that makes him
Feel vulnerable.

25:37.267 --> 25:39.067
And he can't Allow
himself The vulnerability.

25:39.133 --> 25:42.901
Escape into the fantasy Protects him
from ever Having to look at himself.

25:42.968 --> 25:44.567
You know, If the
unsub lives In their skin,

25:44.634 --> 25:46.400
Odds are, He's living
in Their hotel rooms.

25:46.467 --> 25:48.400
Any i. d.
On the body?

25:48.467 --> 25:49.734
Medical examiner:
No wallet, nothing.

25:49.801 --> 25:51.567
It might have dropped.
They're searching now.

25:51.634 --> 25:52.934
You're not gonna
Find anything.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.601
We need to roll
The prints and run 'em.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.601
We need to figure out Who he
is and where He was staying.

25:58.534 --> 26:01.267
Prints belong To deacon
rogers, Odessa, texas.

26:01.334 --> 26:02.734
He's got a couple
Of minor arrests-

26:02.801 --> 26:04.267
One for
Marijuana possession

26:04.334 --> 26:05.767
And one for lewd behavior,

26:05.834 --> 26:08.133
Which i'm guessing is code
For gay in texas.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.834
His credit card Shows him
staying At a south beach hotel.

26:16.267 --> 26:17.400
Lopez: it's open.

26:41.634 --> 26:44.167
Clear.

26:45.367 --> 26:48.133
Boy, he tore through
This place in a hurry.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.534
What was he
Looking for?

26:49.601 --> 26:52.133
Identity, Anything to possess A new one.

26:52.200 --> 26:54.200
He thinks there's A witness
out there Who can i. d. Him.

26:54.267 --> 26:56.434
It's not about fulfilling
His need anymore.

26:56.501 --> 26:58.300
It's about
His own survival.

26:58.367 --> 26:59.634
How does he escape?

27:02.934 --> 27:04.701
I'm gonna find out If
deacon rogers Had a car here.

27:18.868 --> 27:20.801
I can pay you
Gas money.

27:20.868 --> 27:23.300
Aw, hell, who cares
About that, boy?

27:23.367 --> 27:25.234
Just obliged To have
someone Along for the ride.

27:29.400 --> 27:32.567
The sun out here
Is really dangerous.

27:32.634 --> 27:35.067
Dangerous, huh?
Where you from?

27:35.133 --> 27:36.067
Germany.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.934
Can you Say that again
- "dangerous"?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.100
Dangerous.

27:41.167 --> 27:45.300
"dangerous. " yeah.

27:45.367 --> 27:47.133
Dangerous.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.367
Lopez: think we
Missed something?

27:53.434 --> 27:54.734
I don't know.

27:54.801 --> 27:56.634
Forensics pulled hair
From the sink,

27:56.701 --> 27:58.601
But it'll be days
Before we get results.

27:58.667 --> 28:00.100
We don't have
That kind of time.

28:00.167 --> 28:01.300
The unsub can't
Follow his pattern.

28:01.367 --> 28:02.701
He thinks There might
have been A witness,

28:02.767 --> 28:05.067
So he's gonna need To change
identities Sooner than usual.

28:05.133 --> 28:08.334
What if he can't?
What do you mean?

28:08.400 --> 28:12.000
We're predicting that The unsub may
take another Life in the next 24 hours

28:12.067 --> 28:13.701
Because there was a witness
Who saw him.

28:13.767 --> 28:16.200
Remember what garcia said,
That specific paradigm-

28:16.267 --> 28:17.400
2 victims in one day?

28:17.467 --> 28:18.934
That occurred
One other time.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.934
The first 2 men disappeared
On the same day.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.234
Because somebody might
Have seen something

28:22.300 --> 28:23.634
That threatened The
unsub with Getting caught?

28:23.701 --> 28:25.367
It's worth profiling.

28:25.434 --> 28:28.100
Steven fitzgerald First
went missing 2 months ago,

28:28.167 --> 28:30.234
Took a bus to miami
From oakland park,

28:30.300 --> 28:32.033
Which is
Just up the highway,

28:32.100 --> 28:33.534
Never seen again.

28:33.601 --> 28:35.100
Robert feeney flew
In for a wedding

28:35.167 --> 28:37.067
But never arrived
At his hotel.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.067
We need to get
Back in these files,

28:39.133 --> 28:40.400
Question
Both families.

28:40.467 --> 28:42.367
Somewhere along the way,
Their paths May have crossed.

28:56.701 --> 28:58.334
There's a case
We're working on

28:58.400 --> 29:00.234
Which may be connected To
your son's Disappearance.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.467
Is that right?

29:01.534 --> 29:03.234
Unfortunately,
It's a murder case, sir.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.634
Someone is attacking men
Who are traveling alone.

29:05.701 --> 29:07.701
This man's
Attacking homosexuals.

29:07.767 --> 29:09.834
Can you confirm that
Your son steven is gay?

29:09.901 --> 29:13.834
Why, i know he was Confused
about his Sexual orientation.

29:13.901 --> 29:15.133
How do you mean,
Confused?

29:15.200 --> 29:17.801
There were A number of
issues He needed to sort out.

29:17.868 --> 29:19.467
Was there
A friend in miami

29:19.534 --> 29:20.868
Steven was going
To see?

29:20.934 --> 29:22.868
No. He didn't
Have many friends,

29:22.934 --> 29:24.167
Pretty much
Kept to himself.

29:24.234 --> 29:26.801
So once he got on the bus,
You never heard from him.

29:26.868 --> 29:28.667
No.

29:28.734 --> 29:31.200
You seem resigned
To this fact.

29:33.133 --> 29:35.868
Wherever steven is, i trust
It's a better place for him.

29:35.934 --> 29:38.200
Well, that's A remarkable
kind Of strength.

29:38.267 --> 29:40.734
That's because of My personal
relationship With the lord.

29:40.801 --> 29:43.634
He gives me my strength
And my guidance.

29:43.701 --> 29:45.968
And you apply That philosophy
To your job, as well?

29:46.067 --> 29:48.501
Well, a prison guard depends
On his instincts,

29:48.567 --> 29:50.100
His skills,
And his strength.

29:50.167 --> 29:51.667
Otherwise, we'd get
Ourselves killed.

29:51.734 --> 29:54.968
My faith
Is my personal code.

29:55.033 --> 29:57.467
Defense tactics classes
Are required

29:57.534 --> 29:59.467
For all employees
At the prison, right?

30:01.734 --> 30:04.167
Once he got to the motel,
He was supposed to call.

30:04.234 --> 30:05.467
But he never did.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.234
Every time
That phone rings-

30:10.300 --> 30:14.400
I know in my heart That
steven Was happy that day.

30:14.467 --> 30:18.167
I swear, It was the first time
I'd seen him smile in years.

30:18.234 --> 30:20.601
He'd been talking about
Taking that trip for weeks.

30:20.667 --> 30:23.267
Sarah, you don't have To justify
your brother Getting on that bus.

30:23.334 --> 30:25.267
Yes...

30:25.334 --> 30:28.267
I do, 'cause...

30:28.334 --> 30:30.234
It was my fault.

30:30.300 --> 30:32.200
Did steven follow
In your footsteps?

30:32.267 --> 30:35.367
Did he look to god for
Strength and guidance?

30:35.434 --> 30:37.133
My troubles with steven

30:37.200 --> 30:39.767
Has-they have Nothing
to do With my-my faith.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.200
We belong to
A very tolerant church,

30:41.267 --> 30:43.367
Sometimes too tolerant,
And they teach

30:43.434 --> 30:45.601
That god loves everyone,
Despite their failings.

30:45.667 --> 30:47.634
And you saw Steven's
homosexuality As a failing.

30:47.701 --> 30:49.133
I'm a prison guard.

30:49.200 --> 30:51.467
I mean, you know
How many times

30:51.534 --> 30:53.000
I've walked in
On men together?

30:53.067 --> 30:56.234
Had to physically Pull
them apart? It was filthy.

30:57.968 --> 30:59.567
Oh, it's filthy.

30:59.634 --> 31:01.601
I think he just wanted
To do it to piss me off.

31:01.667 --> 31:04.467
You think your son's Sexuality
was a way To anger you?

31:04.534 --> 31:07.300
I was trying to save him.
From what?

31:07.367 --> 31:09.601
From himself.

31:09.667 --> 31:11.100
Why would
You say that?

31:11.167 --> 31:13.801
Because i gave steven
The money to go to miami.

31:13.868 --> 31:15.801
Why?

31:15.868 --> 31:19.601
I was trying to help him
To-to go somewhere else,

31:19.667 --> 31:22.934
Somewhere
He could feel safe.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.534
Safe from what?

31:29.300 --> 31:30.567
What are you
Looking for, sarah?

31:30.634 --> 31:32.701
You afraid somebody's
Gonna hear you?

31:32.767 --> 31:35.534
Who were you protecting
Your brother from,

31:35.601 --> 31:36.534
Your father?

31:36.601 --> 31:39.100
Was your father
Hurting steven?

31:41.434 --> 31:45.400
He-he really believes
He was doing what's right.

31:45.467 --> 31:47.234
So he did throw him
Around a little bit.

31:47.300 --> 31:49.934
They just
- They didn't see Eye to eye.

31:51.801 --> 31:53.667
Steven couldn't
Stay here anymore,

31:53.734 --> 31:57.000
And-and i had to
Help him get out.

31:57.067 --> 31:58.901
Is your father
Hurting you, too?

31:58.968 --> 32:01.300
Never.

32:01.367 --> 32:03.968
How come?

32:04.033 --> 32:07.200
Because she's not
The one who's gay.

32:07.267 --> 32:09.033
And how were you
Trying to help him?

32:09.100 --> 32:10.434
I've been a guard
For 20 years.

32:10.501 --> 32:11.934
I know a little Something
about Disciplining somebody.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.234
So, what,
You thought

32:13.300 --> 32:14.968
You could Beat homosexuality Out of him,

32:15.033 --> 32:16.434
I don't like your tone.

32:16.501 --> 32:18.467
Threatening this boy With tactics
you use On hardened criminals?

32:18.534 --> 32:19.767
Threatening him
With his own life?

32:19.834 --> 32:21.133
I was teaching him
How to be a man.

32:21.200 --> 32:22.634
No. You were teaching him
How to kill one.

32:22.701 --> 32:24.434
You convinced him
He was worthless,

32:24.501 --> 32:26.601
Contemptible for
Being who he was,

32:26.667 --> 32:29.834
And he believed you,
So he found a way

32:29.901 --> 32:32.834
To become Someone else, Anyone else.

32:32.901 --> 32:35.801
Steven isn't missing, sir. He's
the offender We're looking for.

32:44.400 --> 32:47.534
10-4. Send that information
To my office.

32:49.534 --> 32:51.601
Texas plates.

32:51.667 --> 32:53.467
Deacon rogers
Never rented a car.

32:53.534 --> 32:57.234
He drove here from texas
In this.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.100
Put it out as a bolo.

32:59.167 --> 33:00.601
Agent hotchner
Is taking statements

33:00.667 --> 33:02.067
From the family
Of steven fitzgerald.

33:02.133 --> 33:03.267
He might be our unsub.

33:03.334 --> 33:04.734
Seriously?

33:04.801 --> 33:06.300
It's an unusual
Household.

33:06.367 --> 33:07.934
We've had his picture
This whole time?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.133
Apparently.

33:09.200 --> 33:10.801
Didn't know soon enough
To prevent this.

33:10.868 --> 33:13.701
One set Of tire tracks in, Nothing out.

33:13.767 --> 33:15.100
Lopez: yeah, i noticed.

33:15.167 --> 33:18.200
County spotted the vehicle
20 minutes ago just as-is.

33:18.267 --> 33:20.033
Asphyxiated?
Heh.

33:20.100 --> 33:22.534
Why mess with a good thing?
It's clearly working For him.

33:22.601 --> 33:24.701
This stretch of road
Takes you out of the city.

33:24.767 --> 33:27.734
If we lose steven now, It could take
us months To catch up with him again.

33:27.801 --> 33:28.734
May i?

33:28.801 --> 33:31.334
Knock yourself out.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.434
What is it?

33:36.501 --> 33:38.033
Some kind
Of scraps of paper.

33:38.100 --> 33:39.634
Looks like
A fast-food wrapper.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.734
It's a receipt
For a youth hostel.

33:43.801 --> 33:45.434
It's dated
Last night.

33:45.501 --> 33:48.267
The name On it is, uh, Michael aldridge.

33:48.334 --> 33:49.934
From the looks
Of his sunburn,

33:50.000 --> 33:52.133
It's a good guess This
young man Was hitchhiking.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.234
Assuming steven's taken over
Michael's identity,

33:54.300 --> 33:55.767
He might've hitched
A ride out of here.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.901
He didn't drive?
Not if michael didn't.

33:57.968 --> 34:00.067
He's not becoming His victims
by choice. It's his illness.

34:00.133 --> 34:02.167
He'd have to travel
The exact same way.

34:02.234 --> 34:03.300
Hostels.

34:03.367 --> 34:05.000
There's a few hostels
In north miami beach,

34:05.067 --> 34:08.167
4 miles that way, And
in seneca, 5 miles west.

34:08.234 --> 34:09.467
Ok. We'll
Have to split up.

34:09.534 --> 34:11.400
We'll take seneca. You
take North miami beach.

34:14.833 --> 34:17.934
Uh, michael aldridge
Checked in an hour ago.

34:18.000 --> 34:19.033
What room
Did you put him in?

34:19.100 --> 34:20.634
It's like a day room
Kind of thing,

34:20.701 --> 34:22.132
Like a dormitory.

34:22.199 --> 34:23.934
A dormitory
Full of kids?

34:24.000 --> 34:26.167
Uh, it's pretty full.

34:26.234 --> 34:27.467
Lopez, slow down.

34:27.534 --> 34:29.967
The rest of my team Is on
their way. We should wait.

34:30.033 --> 34:32.266
Look. I got a nut With a
gun in A hostel full of kids.

34:32.333 --> 34:34.132
If you want
To wait, wait.

34:34.199 --> 34:35.801
Let's go.

34:40.567 --> 34:42.033

Nobody panic.

Pretty sure, huh?

38:17.133 --> 38:21.067
Well, let's call it
An educated guess.

39:49.501 --> 39:51.300
Than him being gay,
You know,

39:51.367 --> 39:53.467
Well,

39:53.534 --> 39:57.000

Ok, i-i don't care About that.
It's not About the relocating.

40:34.334 --> 40:38.334
It's not about traveling On

40:38.400 --> 40:41.200
I- i didn't want
To tell anyone,

40:41.267 --> 40:44.033
Because the minute

40:44.100 --> 40:46.367
It becomes-
It becomes real,

40:46.434 --> 40:48.701
And when It becomes
real, People get hurt,

40:48.767 --> 40:52.400
And i've-well, i've Always run
from getting Hurt, always, and-

40:54.300 --> 40:56.901

To run anymore,

40:56.968 --> 41:00.100
