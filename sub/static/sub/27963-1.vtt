00:39.340 --> 00:40.820
Excuse me.

00:40.820 --> 00:42.800
Excuse me, do you work here?

00:47.780 --> 00:49.440
Who are you?

00:53.580 --> 00:55.260
I’m Marcus.

01:03.600 --> 01:05.080
Just collecting a debt.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.400
But I don’t owe anyone any money!

01:09.000 --> 01:10.760
Not money.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.200
No wait.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.320
No wait, my time isn’t up yet.

01:18.360 --> 01:20.080
I can't give you...

01:20.880 --> 01:21.780
I still have five years!

01:50.520 --> 01:51.660
You sure you want to see this one?

01:51.660 --> 01:53.520
We can still change our tickets if we leave
now.

01:53.520 --> 01:54.680
Oh my God, yes, I’m sure!

01:54.680 --> 01:55.680
I love her.

01:56.240 --> 02:00.060
Plus, this is better than all that blood,
and guts, and killing, right?

02:00.080 --> 02:01.100
Of course.

02:04.120 --> 02:05.200
You know.

02:05.220 --> 02:07.260
You’re so damn beautiful.

02:20.520 --> 02:21.320
Hey!

02:21.360 --> 02:22.580
No smoking man.

02:23.820 --> 02:25.280
How inconsiderate of me.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.520
Oh my God!

02:32.260 --> 02:33.400
Remember this?

02:36.080 --> 02:37.080
Crap.

02:38.480 --> 02:40.440
Don’t I have more time?

02:40.780 --> 02:41.960
Afraid not.

02:50.200 --> 02:51.980
Beautiful women.

02:52.020 --> 02:54.020
Usually mean problems buddy.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.240
I didn’t appreciate that comment you made
earlier.

03:07.240 --> 03:08.020
Hey Raquel.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.180
Didn’t know you were there.

03:10.700 --> 03:13.900
Always assume I’m there.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.340
Yeah well, she was a little young, wasn’t
she?

03:16.340 --> 03:19.320
She was 15 when she signed the contract.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.180
Ten years seems like an
eternity to a teenager.

03:23.220 --> 03:24.440
True.

03:31.560 --> 03:34.740
You’ve collected quite a few already.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.940
Okay, you’re good.

03:45.940 --> 03:47.840
Whose next?

03:47.840 --> 03:50.280
We just have the colonel coming up.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.500
Fantastic.

03:53.320 --> 03:58.580
It’s people like him who make me so thrilled
I have you by my side.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.780
Don’t mistake my servitude
to you for solidarity.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.000
You’re alive because we have a deal!

04:08.000 --> 04:11.420
Forget that again, I’ll watch you die with
a smile.

04:13.680 --> 04:15.460
And you’ll lose your collector.

04:16.500 --> 04:19.380
You need me
just as much as I need you.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.399
I don’t need anybody.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.540
You’re just useful to me for the moment.

04:30.840 --> 04:32.800
Can I get back to work?

04:41.020 --> 04:41.820
Yes.

04:42.200 --> 04:44.880
You’ll get the colonel’s
picture and location.

04:44.880 --> 04:51.080
The place is well guarded so we’ll soon
see just how useful you are.

05:48.580 --> 05:51.020
Eli, tie him up.

05:54.220 --> 05:55.980
Where’s the detonator?

05:55.980 --> 05:58.680
You can do better than that, gringo.

06:00.600 --> 06:02.040
I won’t ask again.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.440
Where’s the detonator?

06:04.820 --> 06:06.900
Go ahead, shoot me.

06:07.340 --> 06:10.840
But the hundreds who die after that, are on
you.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.740
Search this place, Eli.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.060
Look.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.580
You tell me what I want to know.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.200
And I promise you.

06:48.820 --> 06:50.900
She’ll be safe with us.

06:56.800 --> 07:00.080
You want me to trust you, and your country?

07:00.560 --> 07:02.860
You can’t guarantee anything.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.620
You want a guarantee?

07:07.680 --> 07:10.600
I guarantee she won’t bleed to death if
you tell us where the detonator is!

07:10.600 --> 07:12.380
What are you doing?

07:16.500 --> 07:18.640
The bomb is
somewhere in Houston, Marcus.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.540
My family is there.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.260
Oh we don’t?

07:48.800 --> 07:49.840
We’ve got the target.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.000
Requesting evac helo.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.580
ETA 10 minutes.

07:52.580 --> 07:54.900
Can you extract any
information from the target?

07:54.900 --> 07:56.260
He’s not talking sir.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.960
Our team is blind.

07:57.960 --> 08:00.120
There are too many
potential bomb locations.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.100
Is there any way to get the information out
of him?

08:06.340 --> 08:07.420
No sir.

08:08.740 --> 08:09.740
He’s alone.

09:55.740 --> 09:56.680
Where’s the colonel?

09:56.680 --> 09:57.440
Upstairs.

10:37.840 --> 10:38.900
What do you want?

10:40.540 --> 10:43.280
Do you remember May 21st 1995?

10:49.280 --> 10:52.980
How does a Python Unit agent end up with a
job like this?

10:53.980 --> 10:55.560
I see your patch.

10:55.560 --> 10:58.320
I trained several of your predecessors.

10:58.320 --> 11:02.040
I assume it’s just fitting that my life
will end by one of them.

11:04.980 --> 11:06.700
You look calm.

11:07.660 --> 11:11.080
I’m responsible for my actions.
I’m not gonna run.

11:11.080 --> 11:15.100
But I thought I had another 2 years with my
family.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.220
Just following orders.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.040
I’d object but I know better
than to pick a fight with you.

11:29.220 --> 11:31.240
Before you do this.

11:31.240 --> 11:33.880
You promise me nothing
will happen to my family?

11:36.400 --> 11:38.180
Have you ever let someone go?

11:43.660 --> 11:44.640
No.

11:45.180 --> 11:46.340
Why not?

12:04.480 --> 12:06.480
Get away from me!

12:36.520 --> 12:39.640
Did you order a collector to
extract the colonel’s wife?

12:40.860 --> 12:41.860
No.

12:41.860 --> 12:44.180
Then what just happened?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.540
What a mess.

12:48.680 --> 12:50.680
Looks like...

12:50.680 --> 12:53.640
Someone is trying to steal some
souls too meet their quota.

12:55.760 --> 12:57.620
But why go after the colonel’s wife?

12:57.620 --> 12:59.720
She’s not a designated target.

13:00.320 --> 13:02.100
A soul is a soul.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.000
I don’t know if it’s going to do him or
his handler much good.

13:06.000 --> 13:08.900
If they’re not even bound by contract.

13:08.900 --> 13:12.160
As far as I know, the
souls are rendered void.

13:12.160 --> 13:17.260
But, in any case, let me know if it happens
again.

14:07.880 --> 14:09.280
Who is it?

14:09.280 --> 14:10.820
It’s me.

14:11.840 --> 14:12.920
What do you want?

14:13.340 --> 14:15.120
Just open the door, Eli.

14:30.600 --> 14:31.800
For Christ’s sake.

14:32.380 --> 14:33.760
It wasn’t your fault.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.220
You’re right.

14:38.020 --> 14:39.160
It was yours.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.180
I know you lost your family...

14:43.080 --> 14:43.580
But don’t-

14:43.580 --> 14:44.840
But what Marcus?

14:46.080 --> 14:47.840
You have no family.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.660
You don’t know what you’re talking about.

14:56.940 --> 14:58.980
I look at these...

15:00.040 --> 15:02.040
Trying to think they’re
still here.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.160
That my son is doing his homework.

15:07.860 --> 15:10.820
That my wife is waiting for me to join her.

15:12.460 --> 15:14.440
That my baby...

15:16.320 --> 15:17.820
Is asleep.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.760
In her crib.

15:28.060 --> 15:30.420
But some lunatic...

15:30.420 --> 15:32.600
Decides to blow up the mall.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.220
And you decide...

15:39.860 --> 15:41.860
To spare his family.

15:42.800 --> 15:44.920
Over my family.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.960
You know that’s not true.

15:49.100 --> 15:52.180
We’ve worked together for years, I loved
your family.

15:52.180 --> 15:54.520
But isn’t that exactly what happened?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.660
Didn’t you make that call?

15:57.660 --> 15:58.940
Team leader?

15:59.500 --> 16:01.020
Alright, when the cards were set...

16:01.020 --> 16:02.300
And it was his family.

16:02.300 --> 16:03.520
Or my family.

16:03.520 --> 16:04.940
You chose his.

16:06.660 --> 16:08.440
There were multiple targets that day Eli.

16:08.460 --> 16:09.840
I had no way of knowing...

16:09.840 --> 16:11.060
We had a chance.

16:13.920 --> 16:16.680
Had you followed my orders that day...

16:16.680 --> 16:18.580
Your family.

16:18.580 --> 16:19.680
Would still be alive.

16:19.680 --> 16:20.620
Bullshit!

16:20.620 --> 16:22.900
You really think that your
tactics were going to work?

16:23.240 --> 16:24.380
Reasoning?

16:24.380 --> 16:25.380
With a terrorist?

16:25.380 --> 16:27.340
Your mind was on your family that day.

16:27.340 --> 16:28.740
Not the mission!

16:28.740 --> 16:32.400
And because of that everybody died.

16:35.980 --> 16:37.520
So it was my fault.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.060
For thinking of them.

16:44.500 --> 16:45.640
You know.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.360
Not everyone is like you Marcus.

16:48.560 --> 16:50.340
And even if you had a family.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.500
You wouldn’t care.

16:57.620 --> 16:58.900
Would you?

17:00.000 --> 17:01.500
Would you?!

17:06.079 --> 17:06.980
You’re drunk.

17:07.740 --> 17:09.079
I’m gonna come back another time.

17:09.660 --> 17:10.740
What the hell for?

17:10.740 --> 17:12.500
We’re both out of a job thanks to you.

17:12.819 --> 17:13.819
Okay? You’re not my partner anymore!

17:14.960 --> 17:16.800
You’re just some... some person!

17:16.800 --> 17:18.859
Who let hundreds of people die!

17:25.079 --> 17:26.079
Hey!

17:26.079 --> 17:27.839
My name’s Rick, I’m the new neighbor.

17:27.839 --> 17:32.400
So sorry to bother you this late at night, but
I got locked out and I left my phone inside.

17:32.400 --> 17:35.580
I mean, would you mind
if I could use your -

17:42.040 --> 17:44.340
Hey, I think we got off
on the wrong foot...

18:02.220 --> 18:03.900
Hey buddy.

18:05.740 --> 18:07.260
What are you doing?

18:07.260 --> 18:09.100
Was looking for a new place to live.

18:09.100 --> 18:11.000
Thought this would be a good spot.

18:11.000 --> 18:11.960
What do you think?

18:12.140 --> 18:13.360
What is wrong with you?

18:14.400 --> 18:17.360
I thought you’d appreciate me immobilizing
your target for you.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.000
Why’d you kill his family?

18:21.280 --> 18:23.620
Oh so now we care about families?

18:24.880 --> 18:26.500
That was a long time ago, Eli.

18:27.400 --> 18:29.020
I thought you moved on.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.200
Moved on?

18:31.020 --> 18:33.180
You’ll never understand, will you?

18:33.180 --> 18:36.100
Do you think your family would have wanted
you to do this?

18:36.100 --> 18:37.320
I’m doing this for them.

19:11.940 --> 19:13.340
Seem a bit stronger, huh?

19:15.960 --> 19:18.180
That’s the perk of
extracting these suckers.

19:23.180 --> 19:25.820
Each one actually adds to the strength of
the collector.

19:25.820 --> 19:28.520
Trick is: Don’t cash in your chips.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.260
That’s my cue.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.000
Next time you’re dead.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.280
I guarantee it.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.540
A plumber did this to you?

20:23.280 --> 20:24.180
Eli.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.800
The man stealing the souls is Eli.

20:28.740 --> 20:29.900
Oh, yes.

20:29.900 --> 20:33.300
Your former partner in crime.

20:36.260 --> 20:38.720
He got a little carried away, huh?

20:40.380 --> 20:42.440
I like his style.

20:44.860 --> 20:47.040
He says they give him more power.

20:47.700 --> 20:49.240
What exactly did he say?

20:49.920 --> 20:52.220
I don’t know, I was too busy getting my
ass kicked.

20:56.540 --> 20:58.360
Alright, alright.

21:00.000 --> 21:03.220
He just says that
each soul adds to his strength.

21:04.280 --> 21:07.180
And the trick is not
to “cash in his chips.”

21:20.060 --> 21:22.220
You need to stop him, Marcus.

21:23.900 --> 21:25.040
From?

21:25.840 --> 21:27.720
Collecting anymore souls.

21:29.240 --> 21:32.080
He is a threat and a liability.

21:32.080 --> 21:35.460
He clearly has no handler
and has gone rogue.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.680
Can’t you issue some demonic warrant or
something?

21:39.680 --> 21:40.540
What are we?

21:40.540 --> 21:41.580
The CIA?

21:42.160 --> 21:44.300
Why do you think I keep you around.

21:44.300 --> 21:46.720
Find him and kill him.

21:46.720 --> 21:49.600
I don’t care what you have to do.

21:58.180 --> 22:00.680
And finish your job.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.000
They’re gone.

22:14.640 --> 22:16.220
They’re all gone.

22:27.760 --> 22:29.280
I sold my soul...

22:30.220 --> 22:31.880
So that they could live a better
life.

22:33.340 --> 22:34.760
I’m sorry.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.860
Oh my God.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.280
What am I doing?

23:06.280 --> 23:07.320
Let me guess.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.320
You’re an angel.

23:15.360 --> 23:16.640
Okay. Nice chat.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.040
My name is Ativus.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.660
And I’m a messenger from God.

23:26.660 --> 23:27.920
Oh, he speaks.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.780
Don’t you have anything better to do?

23:32.600 --> 23:36.380
You’ve fallen into quite the predicament
haven’t you?

23:36.380 --> 23:41.400
Working for a boss who is impossible to please
while she holds your health and life ransom.

23:41.400 --> 23:44.100
Sounds like any job really.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.460
I can help you.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.500
I can help you bring down Eli.

23:49.840 --> 23:51.960
Wait, you guys up there know about him?

23:52.360 --> 23:54.060
Why aren’t you doing anything about it?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.700
He’s messing with my work.

23:56.700 --> 23:59.300
I cannot directly interfere
with human actions.

23:59.300 --> 24:02.200
He has forbade me from doing so.

24:02.540 --> 24:04.360
Why are you wasting my time?

24:04.960 --> 24:06.680
Like I said, I’m a messenger.

24:08.160 --> 24:12.260
You shouldn’t blame yourself for those that
died in the mall all those years ago.

24:12.260 --> 24:13.700
Or any of the others.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.440
Eli’s family was not your fault.

24:18.340 --> 24:20.700
Whether or not I blame myself...

24:21.660 --> 24:23.660
Is none of your
business.

24:25.280 --> 24:26.360
Angel.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.000
Humans can do many things, but they are not
omnipotent.

24:32.620 --> 24:35.580
You did what you thought was right at the
time.

24:35.580 --> 24:40.560
Taking anyone’s life is never right, no
matter the circumstances.

24:42.460 --> 24:45.800
I only wish that you continued to have this
judgement after the incident. But...

24:46.640 --> 24:48.360
You chose this path instead.

24:49.120 --> 24:50.660
Are you kidding me?

24:50.660 --> 24:52.200
I lost everything that day.

24:52.940 --> 24:55.460
My best friend, my job, my reputation.

24:55.460 --> 24:56.460
Everything.

24:56.700 --> 24:59.920
Nobody, government or otherwise, would even
hire me.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.860
That’s what doing the “right thing”
led to.

25:05.620 --> 25:07.040
It doesn’t matter what you think.

25:07.820 --> 25:09.700
It doesn’t matter what God thinks.

25:10.160 --> 25:11.960
I get paid very well.

25:11.960 --> 25:13.860
And I have a good life now.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.080
So what if other people suffer?

25:17.500 --> 25:19.320
They’re the ones that signed the contracts.

25:19.320 --> 25:20.340
Not me.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.640
You and I both know you
could’ve found another way.

25:24.740 --> 25:27.280
That’s why I’m here, Marcus.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.320
You had a moment of repentance.

25:29.320 --> 25:31.520
I know you're a good man deep down.

25:32.740 --> 25:34.740
And you’re the only one who can stop Eli.

25:34.740 --> 25:37.320
What makes you think I want to stop him?

25:37.320 --> 25:39.920
He stopped being my
responsibility years ago.

25:40.860 --> 25:45.840
Eli has been taking hundreds of souls with
the amulet, eradicating entire families.

25:45.840 --> 25:49.620
Therefore making his amulet more
powerful and subsequently, himself.

25:49.620 --> 25:51.980
Can’t you guys put an end to him then?

25:51.980 --> 25:54.000
I mean can’t God smite thee or something?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.820
Go old testament on him.

25:55.820 --> 25:57.540
What you refer to as old
testament is actually-

25:57.540 --> 26:00.160
I don’t need a lecture.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.620
I can’t speak for God.

26:06.380 --> 26:09.220
I can only convey to you what
he wishes me to convey to you.

26:09.220 --> 26:12.180
And help you as he wishes me to help you.

26:12.640 --> 26:13.500
No more.

26:14.260 --> 26:15.520
No less.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.220
So let’s say, hypothetically...

26:30.020 --> 26:30.980
I do care.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.360
What’s in it for me?

26:33.360 --> 26:34.740
If you do nothing.

26:34.740 --> 26:36.480
And Eli continues to grow
stronger.

26:37.220 --> 26:41.100
I’m certain that Raquel will have you
deal with the consequences of failing.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.940
I will not harm you, but we know she will.

26:43.940 --> 26:46.940
I also know you have not been
yourself since the incident.

26:47.720 --> 26:50.060
I can see through your lies
and into your holy spirit.

26:50.060 --> 26:52.420
I’m offering you a chance to set things
right.

26:53.480 --> 26:56.080
Will you accept my help?

27:03.020 --> 27:04.020
Fine.

27:06.720 --> 27:07.720
Yes.

27:11.560 --> 27:14.060
The key to stopping Eli lies in the Elder
Amulet.

27:19.940 --> 27:21.760
So you want me to extract more souls of my
own?

27:21.760 --> 27:23.240
Of course not.

27:23.640 --> 27:24.920
You must seek out Kristen Lockhart.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.520
She’ll be able to tell you more about the
amulet.

27:30.160 --> 27:31.900
And you can’t tell me because?

27:31.900 --> 27:33.080
She will.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.940
And you’re gonna need her.

27:55.560 --> 27:56.680
Hey.

27:58.540 --> 27:59.840
You uhh...

27:59.840 --> 28:02.160
You look like you belong someplace nicer.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.040
Like on my yacht.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.840
I could even name it after you.

28:06.840 --> 28:07.840
What do you think?

28:08.180 --> 28:09.700
I usually get to know someone

28:09.700 --> 28:13.280
Before I decide to get stuck in
the middle of the ocean with them.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.380
Okay. Okay.

28:19.380 --> 28:20.660
Ummm...

28:20.840 --> 28:22.580
I work in advertising.

28:22.580 --> 28:23.680
How about you?

28:23.680 --> 28:25.120
I'm a first grade teacher.

28:25.120 --> 28:25.740
Yeah?

28:26.080 --> 28:27.500
I love working with children.

28:28.220 --> 28:30.160
They're not as complicated as adults.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.280
I one hundred percent agree.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.160
So...

28:33.660 --> 28:34.160
Why are-

28:34.160 --> 28:37.140
I think that is enough small talk.

28:37.140 --> 28:39.420
Look, here’s the deal.

28:39.420 --> 28:43.060
I know a lot about women.

28:43.060 --> 28:44.480
How you feel.

28:44.480 --> 28:45.380
How you think.

28:45.380 --> 28:46.040
You do?

28:46.040 --> 28:46.740
I do. Yes.

28:46.740 --> 28:49.820
The female mind is not a mystery to me.

28:49.820 --> 28:51.840
And I can tell you:

28:51.840 --> 28:54.560
I’m the best that you will ever get.

28:54.980 --> 28:59.460
I have more money available to me on just
one of my cards than you have ever made.

28:59.460 --> 29:01.640
In your entire life.

29:01.640 --> 29:04.600
Now that card, by the way.

29:04.600 --> 29:06.020
Could be used by you.

29:06.020 --> 29:06.940
Just...

29:07.620 --> 29:08.860
Putting that out there.

29:09.380 --> 29:10.280
So uh...

29:11.480 --> 29:15.120
What’s your name, so I can put it on
my yacht?

29:16.800 --> 29:18.660
You might not like my name though.

29:18.660 --> 29:20.080
No, no, no.

29:20.080 --> 29:23.600
I’m sure that you have
the most beautiful name.

29:23.600 --> 29:24.960
It’s Biz.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.960
Biz?

29:27.220 --> 29:30.060
What, is that like your
initials or something?

29:30.060 --> 29:31.000
No, no, no.

29:31.000 --> 29:34.040
Try saying it more with a “P” sound.

29:34.040 --> 29:35.220
Piz?

29:35.220 --> 29:37.720
Last name’s Ouff.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.180
Piz Ouff.

29:39.180 --> 29:40.860
There you go.

29:42.920 --> 29:44.560
That’s very uhh...

29:46.960 --> 29:47.920
Different.

29:48.400 --> 29:49.580
Very, very...

29:50.800 --> 29:52.300
Unique.

29:53.160 --> 29:54.300
I'll tell you what.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.500
If you say my name three times
fast, I’ll give you a present.

30:00.880 --> 30:02.020
Yeah?

30:02.620 --> 30:03.700
Okay.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.580
Pizz ouff, piz off, piss off.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.620
There’s your present.

30:11.620 --> 30:13.760
Now go piss off on your yacht.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.020
You know, you could’ve just said no.

30:27.320 --> 30:29.660
He could’ve just not been an ass.

30:35.260 --> 30:36.620
So what do you teach?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.580
I teach history.

30:42.220 --> 30:44.960
Uh thanks, but I’m not drinking that.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.580
Who said this was for you?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.160
I’ve had a rough night.

30:51.160 --> 30:52.440
Kristen.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.480
How do you know my name?

30:57.860 --> 30:59.180
Who are you?

31:01.340 --> 31:02.860
Would you believe an angel sent me?

31:03.700 --> 31:05.760
Oh God, I’m in no mood for cheesy pickup
lines.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.500
Please leave me alone.

31:08.420 --> 31:09.240
I will.

31:10.460 --> 31:12.260
As soon as you tell me about this.

31:16.300 --> 31:17.620
That isn’t supposed to exist.

31:17.620 --> 31:18.880
Where did you get that?

31:19.920 --> 31:21.020
I have another one actually.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.840
They were on sale.

31:23.460 --> 31:24.920
I’m a collector.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.000
Get away from me.

31:38.840 --> 31:40.020
You’re pretty cute.

31:40.020 --> 31:41.400
This is going to hurt me more than it’s
going to hurt you.

31:42.900 --> 31:43.800
Marcus!

31:43.800 --> 31:44.640
Now it’s a party.

31:45.480 --> 31:46.720
I need her Eli.

31:46.720 --> 31:47.860
Think you can save her?

31:48.300 --> 31:49.540
How about you give me your amulet.

31:49.940 --> 31:50.840
And I’ll let her go.

31:51.720 --> 31:52.700
I don’t need her that badly.

31:53.380 --> 31:55.300
Oh, well then I’ll just kill her.

32:13.440 --> 32:14.380
Is he dead?

32:14.380 --> 32:15.960
No. Just in an alternate state for now.

32:15.960 --> 32:16.860
Come with me.

32:16.860 --> 32:17.400
What is-

32:17.400 --> 32:19.640
And keep your mouth shut or I’ll make you
join him.

32:34.740 --> 32:36.220
Yes. You may speak.

32:36.220 --> 32:37.800
What was that about?

32:37.800 --> 32:38.820
Demons.

32:38.820 --> 32:41.060
I didn’t want them
listening in on anything.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.920
Is your place...

32:43.920 --> 32:45.100
Demon proof then?

32:45.100 --> 32:49.140
No, but I’ve placed safeguards to reduce
their possible entry.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.720
You really know your stuff.

32:55.560 --> 32:57.280
You can save your flattery for later.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.600
You were about to let me die back there.

33:00.040 --> 33:01.220
I saved you didn’t I?

33:01.220 --> 33:02.660
Uhh, what was it that you said?

33:02.660 --> 33:04.980
“I don’t need her that badly.”

33:04.980 --> 33:07.200
I was just trying to keep him off guard.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.820
Basic hostage negotiation tactics.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.020
Some tactics.

33:12.960 --> 33:14.100
Anyway.

33:14.500 --> 33:16.120
Thank you for saving me.

33:16.120 --> 33:17.820
Well don't thank me yet.

33:17.820 --> 33:20.360
I'm just curious about that amulet.

33:20.360 --> 33:22.520
I'm assuming the angel gave it to you?

33:22.520 --> 33:24.140
Yeah, he said you could tell me more about
it.

33:24.140 --> 33:27.860
So I really did get
referred to by an angel.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.320
Makes a hell of a bullet point on a resume,
doesn’t it?

33:30.820 --> 33:32.680
Haha. You should do stand up.

33:33.760 --> 33:34.860
What was his name?

33:35.880 --> 33:37.220
It was a weird name.

33:37.740 --> 33:40.580
It was like Atie, Ati...

33:41.680 --> 33:43.040
Ativus?

33:46.660 --> 33:48.120
Was he your father or something?

33:48.120 --> 33:50.340
No you idiot.

33:51.120 --> 33:52.440
He saved me.

33:54.180 --> 33:56.600
Well he’s been telling me how he can’t
directly interfere with -

33:56.600 --> 33:57.780
From myself.

33:59.140 --> 33:59.780
Oh.

34:01.520 --> 34:02.620
I'm uhh...

34:02.620 --> 34:04.180
I’m glad you got through all that.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.180
I was very young.

34:06.620 --> 34:12.320
My mom was dying and I just wanted to find
a way to keep her from dying.

34:12.320 --> 34:14.480
Keep her with me.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.900
I prayed but...

34:16.800 --> 34:19.179
I never thought someone would
show up.

34:21.300 --> 34:23.000
Oh God, why am I telling you all this?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.500
I barely even know you.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.020
You don’t have to.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.600
Do you have a family?

34:30.420 --> 34:31.900
Does it matter?

34:31.900 --> 34:34.320
I’d like to know who I’m dealing with.

34:36.960 --> 34:37.699
Look...

34:38.800 --> 34:40.440
I lost my family when I was really young.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.380
I don’t know what happened to them.

34:44.440 --> 34:45.980
Some kind of accident.

34:49.280 --> 34:49.940
There.

34:50.699 --> 34:54.159
Now I’m not
a complete stranger. Happy?

34:56.020 --> 34:57.880
I’m sorry about your family.

34:58.460 --> 34:59.280
Yeah.

34:59.280 --> 35:00.200
Well.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.860
It was a long time ago.

35:03.920 --> 35:05.920
So, what happened to your mom?

35:06.820 --> 35:09.460
The cancer took her eventually.

35:11.380 --> 35:13.640
And when she died I...

35:14.460 --> 35:16.780
I didn’t know what
to do with myself.

35:17.440 --> 35:21.940
She was my whole life, she made me who I am
today.

35:21.940 --> 35:24.680
She gave me all these books. She...

35:27.600 --> 35:31.040
I just couldn’t go on without her.

35:31.040 --> 35:36.120
So I bought a gun and-

35:37.040 --> 35:37.780
Hey.

35:39.300 --> 35:41.220
I’m just glad you’re okay now.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.280
So...

35:46.760 --> 35:49.180
Do you always use the angel line?

35:59.100 --> 36:01.420
You scream and you die.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.360
Capisce?

36:09.700 --> 36:10.900
Now.

36:11.600 --> 36:17.040
You might be wondering what I’m doing
in a dump like this.

36:19.280 --> 36:20.400
Power.

36:21.900 --> 36:24.380
Plain and simple.

36:25.940 --> 36:27.320
You want to know a secret?

36:29.240 --> 36:30.780
You’re the last one.

36:31.400 --> 36:33.900
Everyone in your sorority...

36:35.040 --> 36:37.780
Is dead. I just wanted to
see what kind of reaction-

36:44.240 --> 36:46.700
What did I say about making noise?

36:48.340 --> 36:49.200
That was priceless though.

36:54.980 --> 36:57.760
We were having such a
good conversation too.

37:17.860 --> 37:19.300
Breaking news today.

37:19.300 --> 37:23.500
Police officers have been investigating
multiple crime scenes with the exact same M.O.

37:23.500 --> 37:27.280
Which has many speculating on the nature of
these terrible crimes.

37:27.280 --> 37:29.980
All victims have no
visible traces of violence.

37:29.980 --> 37:33.640
And several of those examined do
not have any debilitating disease

37:33.640 --> 37:36.520
Or pre existing medical
condition that could cause death.

37:36.520 --> 37:37.020
Eli.

37:37.580 --> 37:40.040
Entire families have been
found dead in their homes

37:40.040 --> 37:43.100
And the police are currently
investigating possible suspects.

37:43.100 --> 37:46.060
You think another collector is responsible
for this?

37:46.060 --> 37:47.700
I know for a fact that he is.

37:48.160 --> 37:50.520
You just met him outside the bar.

37:50.520 --> 37:52.660
He’s insane.

37:54.140 --> 37:55.220
We need to stop him.

37:55.220 --> 37:57.920
Give me the Elder Amulet, I’m going to have
a closer look at it.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.540
A few religious leaders are calling it the
“rapture.”

38:04.540 --> 38:08.220
Saying that souls are leaving the bodies of
those who have been chosen to go to heaven.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.120
I’m going to go have a smoke.

38:26.940 --> 38:29.160
Glad to see that you two are working
together.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.920
So you saved her huh?

38:35.560 --> 38:38.400
She saved herself after asking for God’s
help.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.900
I only offered her guidance.

38:43.300 --> 38:45.700
I can’t believe it’s Eli killing all those
people.

38:47.440 --> 38:49.440
You know somebody for years and...

38:50.960 --> 38:54.420
After the incident we tried to help Eli.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.840
He shut us out.

38:59.520 --> 39:02.480
We cannot help those who do not wish to be
helped.

39:03.180 --> 39:04.340
You could put a stop to him.

39:04.960 --> 39:05.760
Instead of having
me do it.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.140
I cannot interfere with-

39:07.140 --> 39:08.680
You are a coward then.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.240
God does not interfere with free will.

39:12.240 --> 39:15.340
And I, as his messenger,
cannot do so either.

39:17.740 --> 39:19.140
Remember what I said.

39:19.920 --> 39:21.100
Yeah, and what was that?

39:24.240 --> 39:25.240
What was what?

39:25.620 --> 39:27.620
Were you talking to someone?

39:30.700 --> 39:31.560
No.

39:34.220 --> 39:36.420
I just need to quit smoking.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.800
So, did you find anything?

39:46.800 --> 39:48.380
Uhh, somewhat.

39:48.380 --> 39:52.860
A little conjecture here and there, but I
think we might have something.

39:52.860 --> 39:54.720
This is the Elder Amulet.

39:54.720 --> 39:59.520
It was the first ever amulet created by God
to store any kind of matter or energy.

39:59.520 --> 40:04.240
But the devil took the Elder Amulet when he
was cast down, corrupting its purpose.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.620
Turning it into a collector of souls.

40:08.020 --> 40:11.340
As he fell the amulet
split into several pieces.

40:11.340 --> 40:13.000
How do you know all this?

40:14.440 --> 40:16.320
Studying these books.

40:16.820 --> 40:18.180
Online.

40:18.560 --> 40:20.820
Overhearing demonic conversations.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.364
When my mom passed I
got into the afterlife.

40:25.364 --> 40:29.360
Found out how to do and hear
things I couldn’t before.

40:29.360 --> 40:31.920
So I guess that’s where you heard about
collectors?

40:31.920 --> 40:34.580
Those who steal souls for demons?

40:34.580 --> 40:37.280
Yes. They do refer to you as that.

40:38.040 --> 40:40.540
But, beyond that I’m kind of in the dark.

40:41.520 --> 40:45.700
In any case, the thing I kept hearing
the most about was this Elder Amulet.

40:48.380 --> 40:52.980
Give me your collector amulet.

41:06.880 --> 41:07.740
Woah.

41:08.420 --> 41:09.840
I knew it!

41:09.840 --> 41:14.600
Your amulet is one of the many fragmented
pieces that came from the Elder Amulet.

41:14.600 --> 41:16.760
If we collect all the pieces...

41:16.760 --> 41:21.160
We should be able to return the
Elder Amulet to its original form.

41:21.520 --> 41:23.220
And then what happens?

41:24.480 --> 41:25.460
Well...

41:25.760 --> 41:27.640
I don’t have a clue.

41:30.040 --> 41:31.440
Marcus.

41:32.260 --> 41:34.340
You’ve done excellent work.

41:34.340 --> 41:35.220
Raquel.

41:35.220 --> 41:36.940
I have this under control.

41:37.260 --> 41:39.300
Oh. I believe you.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.420
Which is why I’ll be
taking that elder amulet.

41:42.420 --> 41:43.900
This is bigger than both of us.

41:43.900 --> 41:45.320
If we don’t stop him -

41:48.500 --> 41:51.900
You really overestimate your importance to
me.

41:56.800 --> 42:00.160
Yeah, so, not your best call coming to my
place.

42:00.520 --> 42:03.300
Good luck getting out.

42:13.840 --> 42:15.120
Is she stuck there?

42:15.120 --> 42:16.360
In a way she is.

42:16.360 --> 42:18.580
She won’t be able to track where we are
anymore.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.860
Her powers have been temporarily suppressed
by the symbols around her.

42:33.360 --> 42:34.920
Ativus, is that you?

42:38.920 --> 42:39.620
Thank you, I...

42:39.620 --> 42:41.140
No need to thank me, Kristen.

42:41.140 --> 42:41.980
Thank God.

42:43.540 --> 42:47.240
I’m glad you’ve made the right choice
and have decided to help us.

42:47.240 --> 42:49.140
You’ve saved his life twice already.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.887
I wouldn’t exactly say “saved.”

42:51.887 --> 42:54.460
More like right place, right time...

42:54.460 --> 42:56.720
You’d be dead by now.

42:57.580 --> 42:58.620
Fair point.

42:58.620 --> 43:03.840
As you now know, that Elder Amulet is capable
of fusing with every remaining amulet.

43:04.340 --> 43:08.500
You have one, as does Eli, as well as three
others collectors such as yourself.

43:08.500 --> 43:11.500
As you fuse them together your power will
increase exponentially.

43:11.500 --> 43:15.600
So we have to put as many amulets together
as we can to take out Eli.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.440
And you must hurry.

43:18.840 --> 43:21.800
You have three days to
acquire all three amulets.

43:21.800 --> 43:25.325
If you take longer than that, it
will be impossible to defeat him.

43:25.325 --> 43:29.160
As Eli’s power is increasing
with every soul he takes.

43:29.160 --> 43:31.940
I've marked where two of the collectors
are on your phone.

43:32.580 --> 43:34.000
That’s a neat trick.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.900
The third of them is extremely elusive.

43:36.900 --> 43:39.600
Even I’m having trouble locating him.

43:39.600 --> 43:41.740
He is probably being shielded by a demon.

43:41.740 --> 43:44.020
You’re going to have to figure out where
he is on your own.

43:44.020 --> 43:47.520
Speaking of demons, as soon as Raquel is free
she’s totally gonna kill us.

43:47.520 --> 43:49.820
How long will your warding last, Kristen?

43:50.340 --> 43:52.620
Maybe 24 hours.

43:53.460 --> 43:56.340
What about Eli? Where do we find him?

43:59.180 --> 44:01.880
I can’t tell you where he is yet.

44:01.880 --> 44:02.580
Why?

44:07.620 --> 44:09.860
He says you’re not ready.

44:13.960 --> 44:16.500
Guess I’m going to have to get used that.

44:27.260 --> 44:29.200
Whoa, careful.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.460
That might burn me.

44:31.100 --> 44:32.800
Anyway, I got a place we can go to.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.680
It’s got a hundred percent less demon than
yours.

44:36.060 --> 44:37.040
Let’s go.

44:53.240 --> 44:55.320
So this is your hideout?

44:56.360 --> 44:59.300
I knew at some point I was going to
have to protect myself from demons.

44:59.300 --> 45:00.520
Do these work?

45:01.300 --> 45:02.220
I don’t know.

45:02.380 --> 45:03.500
In theory they should.

45:03.700 --> 45:05.740
Well that's very reassuring.

45:08.440 --> 45:12.040
I mean I can’t exactly go up to Raquel and
say: "Hey!"

45:12.040 --> 45:14.540
“You mind if I stab you
with this real quick?”

45:16.080 --> 45:19.940
Okay, before we go any further, I need some
clarification from you.

45:21.880 --> 45:22.860
Yes.

45:23.820 --> 45:24.980
I’m single.

45:26.700 --> 45:29.280
About the task at hand Casanova.

45:30.720 --> 45:32.560
What’s your role as a collector?

45:33.200 --> 45:35.460
Why don’t the demons
collect their own souls?

45:36.120 --> 45:38.260
They used to, a long time ago.

45:38.680 --> 45:40.060
All these deals were made.

45:40.060 --> 45:42.220
For fame, fortune, beauty.

45:42.820 --> 45:45.100
10 years for this, 50 years for that.

45:47.120 --> 45:48.240
They use these.

45:51.660 --> 45:55.400
I always thought these would be on fire or
something.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.100
Hell isn’t an oven.

45:57.100 --> 45:58.820
It’s actually freezing.

45:59.700 --> 46:01.780
Anyway, these contracts, they’re locked.

46:01.780 --> 46:05.240
A demon cannot collect
a soul before it’s due.

46:06.320 --> 46:08.220
And a human can?

46:08.760 --> 46:09.760
Yes.

46:10.180 --> 46:12.080
With the amulet.

46:12.080 --> 46:14.540
Humans can break the contract.

46:14.540 --> 46:15.760
As early as their handler-

46:15.760 --> 46:16.840
Demon.

46:18.200 --> 46:19.300
Demon.

46:20.540 --> 46:21.760
Wants.

46:22.440 --> 46:24.820
And why do they need them earlier?

46:25.720 --> 46:29.820
More souls in hell earlier, just
quicker turnaround for the next soul.

46:29.820 --> 46:32.420
To them souls are just currency.

46:32.420 --> 46:33.820
One here, one there.

46:33.820 --> 46:35.060
It doesn’t make a difference who it is.

46:35.060 --> 46:39.820
All that matters is getting as many
as possible as fast as possible.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.620
And what are they to you?

46:43.620 --> 46:45.700
Currency as well?

46:48.560 --> 46:49.800
I’m just carrying out orders.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.900
Don’t you feel anything?

46:51.900 --> 46:54.220
Ripping their souls away?

47:01.120 --> 47:02.740
I had nowhere to go.

47:03.360 --> 47:05.740
Nobody would hire me
after that mall bombing.

47:06.700 --> 47:08.600
The Houston bombing?

47:09.040 --> 47:11.600
You were responsible for that?

47:17.100 --> 47:18.960
If you could save your mother...

47:20.320 --> 47:21.480
Would you sacrifice
the lives of others?

47:22.140 --> 47:24.020
I’d sacrifice myself.

47:24.460 --> 47:29.220
Okay well that day, I didn’t feel
that sacrificing an innocent life...

47:30.020 --> 47:32.700
Was worth potentially saving hundreds.

47:33.360 --> 47:38.060
The rest of the world didn’t agree with
my decision and I lost everything.

47:39.800 --> 47:41.160
Everything.

47:44.260 --> 47:46.300
Then I met Raquel.

47:47.840 --> 47:50.600
She even offered to keep
my sickness in check.

47:50.600 --> 47:51.960
Cancer?

47:52.880 --> 47:55.020
Something unknown.

47:56.160 --> 47:57.160
Untreatable.

47:57.760 --> 48:01.340
That’s still not an excuse for what you’ve
done.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.320
How many souls have you taken?

48:05.320 --> 48:07.940
How many lives have you ended?

48:07.940 --> 48:09.839
What’s it to you?

48:09.840 --> 48:12.720
Maybe dozens, maybe hundreds.

48:12.720 --> 48:15.720
Look if I don’t do it, I’ll die.

48:17.180 --> 48:21.500
Even when I try to save lives like I
did back in Houston, people still die.

48:22.500 --> 48:25.200
That’s because you can’t save everyone.

48:26.180 --> 48:27.460
Okay?

48:28.440 --> 48:29.720
I couldn’t save my mother.

48:29.720 --> 48:33.700
But just because of that I don’t go around
killing people like you do.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.960
It doesn’t give you the right to do what
you do.

48:37.960 --> 48:39.920
Different circumstances.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.100
Bull.

48:44.400 --> 48:46.300
How about we just focus on the job.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.820
First guy owns a kickboxing gym.

48:59.440 --> 49:01.060
Robert Henderson.

49:01.260 --> 49:04.640
He always closes early in order to free up
his evenings for collecting.

49:04.640 --> 49:06.620
I’m going to need your help.

49:06.620 --> 49:10.320
I will help you as much as
I can from a safe distance.

49:10.320 --> 49:12.560
Don’t worry, I’m going to take care of
Robert.

49:12.560 --> 49:15.780
I just need you to get me in the office.

49:19.920 --> 49:21.220
Fine.

49:22.000 --> 49:23.420
What do you need me to do?

49:25.220 --> 49:28.120
Pretend you don’t
know how to fight. Distract his customers.

49:28.120 --> 49:29.080
Pretend?

49:29.080 --> 49:30.940
You handled Eli really well.

49:30.940 --> 49:32.720
Super powers be damned.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.020
Yeah, literally.

49:36.620 --> 49:38.520
Hey! Do you guys mind giving me a lesson?

49:38.520 --> 49:40.100
I’m thinking about taking classes.

49:40.840 --> 49:42.500
Sure, yeah, what do you want to know?

49:42.500 --> 49:43.740
Definitely.

49:44.320 --> 49:47.680
I’m not really sure, I’ve just never really
hit anyone before.

49:48.260 --> 49:49.260
Oh yeah, no problem.

49:49.260 --> 49:52.800
Just give us a second, we’ll put some
equipment away, and be right back.

49:54.180 --> 49:55.300
And while you do that.

49:55.300 --> 49:58.580
I’ll have a nice
little chat with our friend Robert.

50:03.580 --> 50:04.580
Come in.

50:11.080 --> 50:12.320
Mr. Henderson?

50:13.000 --> 50:13.720
Yes.

50:14.160 --> 50:15.140
What do you want?

50:15.140 --> 50:16.480
Oh, this will only take a second.

50:20.860 --> 50:25.080
Would you be so kind as to hand over your
amulet?

50:26.100 --> 50:28.200
What are you talking about?

50:30.500 --> 50:31.860
No need to play coy.

50:33.460 --> 50:35.186
I’m a fellow collector as well.

50:35.186 --> 50:36.960
I’m just gonna be needing it.

50:44.800 --> 50:45.920
Listen.

50:46.620 --> 50:49.420
I don’t know who you think I am
or what you think I have.

50:50.080 --> 50:53.520
But you better get the hell out
of my face before I break yours.

50:59.800 --> 51:01.200
See?

51:01.200 --> 51:03.340
Where’s yours?

51:23.860 --> 51:24.960
Let’s start with the basics.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.520
You gotta curl up your fist like this when
you punch.

51:27.520 --> 51:28.840
Thumb outside of your fingers.

51:31.100 --> 51:33.680
Alright, you catch on pretty quick!

51:33.680 --> 51:35.300
Okay, let’s try a right cross.

51:35.300 --> 51:36.720
Looks something like this.

51:40.980 --> 51:43.240
Now, try punching his hand.

51:52.180 --> 51:53.540
What’s the matter there?

51:53.540 --> 51:54.360
Nothing!

51:54.640 --> 51:55.360
Just...

51:55.980 --> 51:58.420
You know my wrist’s been bad all week.

51:58.420 --> 52:00.900
Doctor says it’s going to
take time to recover you know.

52:00.900 --> 52:02.020
First I hear of that.

52:02.500 --> 52:04.180
So, I can punch!

52:04.180 --> 52:05.400
What else do you guys know?

52:05.400 --> 52:07.520
I guess we could show you how to block?

52:29.520 --> 52:31.740
Now, tell me where the amulet is.

52:32.940 --> 52:34.000
Cabinet.

52:34.140 --> 52:35.420
Night night.

52:52.620 --> 52:54.440
Thank you so much for the tips you guys!

52:54.440 --> 52:55.680
I’ve really learned a lot.

52:55.680 --> 52:56.640
Anytime!

52:56.640 --> 52:58.880
I see real potential in you.
You’ve got great technique.

52:58.880 --> 53:00.080
Awww, thank you!

53:00.540 --> 53:02.620
You take care of that wrist okay?

53:03.040 --> 53:06.380
Well I gotta get going now but I’ll make
sure to come back again sometime.

53:06.380 --> 53:07.420
You should sign up!

53:07.420 --> 53:08.600
I’ll go get Robert.

53:08.600 --> 53:09.780
Uhh, no, no, no!

53:09.780 --> 53:11.700
It’s fine, I’ll just make sure to call
him.

53:11.700 --> 53:14.520
Don’t worry about it, he knows him pretty
well, he can probably get you a -

53:24.800 --> 53:27.100
What just happened? Was it their naptime?

53:27.100 --> 53:30.160
Uhh, they were gonna go get Robert, so...

53:30.160 --> 53:31.380
Yeah.

53:33.540 --> 53:35.320
Did you get the amulet?

53:35.320 --> 53:37.440
Yeah, but I’m pretty sure you could’ve
handled him yourself.

53:37.440 --> 53:40.340
I mean, how does a teacher become a martial
arts master?

53:40.340 --> 53:42.580
What, a teacher can’t be a black belt?

53:43.480 --> 53:44.480
Cool.

53:44.860 --> 53:45.860
Now what?

53:46.820 --> 53:48.780
Now it’s going to get a little trickier.

53:50.840 --> 53:53.079
We’re gonna have to summon a demon.

53:53.079 --> 53:55.739
I thought we were trying to avoid them.

53:55.740 --> 53:57.900
Well, we’re avoiding one of them.

54:03.120 --> 54:05.160
No, no no. Not a circle.

54:07.920 --> 54:09.380
Isn’t that what everybody draws?

54:09.380 --> 54:14.780
Well, yes, but the energy is far better if
we draw a triangle.

54:18.720 --> 54:20.420
Do the shapes really matter?

54:20.420 --> 54:22.060
Everything matters.

54:22.540 --> 54:24.660
Down to where the candles are placed.

54:26.720 --> 54:30.880
Most people think it’s easy to
summon demons, but it’s really not.

54:32.580 --> 54:34.960
Most of the time they won’t even show up.

54:36.100 --> 54:37.620
Raquel made it easy
with the beacon I guess.

54:37.620 --> 54:39.800
Ugh, don’t mention that
horrible demon again.

54:40.860 --> 54:42.880
For what it’s worth, she’s actually pretty
hot.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.200
You think that’s what she actually looks
like?

54:47.780 --> 54:51.480
I mean demons project whoever or whatever
they want to be.

54:51.480 --> 54:58.600
So for all you know she could look her actual
age, which would be about 3,000 years old.

55:00.080 --> 55:01.920
I really wish you hadn’t told me that...

55:04.920 --> 55:06.540
Alright, everything’s set.

55:15.580 --> 55:16.600
So what are you waiting for?

55:17.240 --> 55:19.360
I really hate demons.

55:20.060 --> 55:23.340
They’re the ones that filled me with all
sorts of crap after mom died.

55:29.100 --> 55:31.880
This is the only way we’re gonna find out
where he is.

55:32.420 --> 55:34.700
You’re using your abilities for good.

55:35.720 --> 55:37.260
And you’re not doing this alone.

55:37.800 --> 55:38.580
Okay?

55:44.960 --> 55:46.860
So will the demon be trapped?

55:46.860 --> 55:51.200
Uh, well, if we did an
evocation we could trap it.

55:51.200 --> 55:54.180
The problem with that is that it will be very
hard to get information out of it that way

55:54.180 --> 55:56.720
Since it would know that we’re trying to
trap it.

55:56.720 --> 55:59.300
So we’re doing an invocation instead.

56:00.800 --> 56:02.560
You lost me at evocation.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.780
We’re inviting it in, instead of trapping
it.

56:05.780 --> 56:08.340
So we’re inviting a demon in to try to
kill us?

56:08.340 --> 56:09.840
Well it could.

56:09.840 --> 56:11.340
I’m betting it won’t.

56:11.340 --> 56:13.720
Besides it’s the fastest way to get what
we need.

56:13.720 --> 56:15.660
If we trap it, it’ll likely keep it’s
mouth shut.

56:15.660 --> 56:20.400
So unless you’ve been trained to torture
demons, we won’t get far with that method.

56:21.020 --> 56:22.340
Invocation it is.

56:22.720 --> 56:24.020
I’m sure you know what your doing.

56:24.020 --> 56:27.340
Well, I hope I still do too.

56:35.300 --> 56:36.600
Now we wait.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.660
What’s your name?

57:15.660 --> 57:16.980
I am Astaroth.

57:18.440 --> 57:19.860
Pleased to meet the two of you.

57:20.820 --> 57:23.320
What a kind invitation and...

57:23.320 --> 57:25.000
A lovely place you have.

57:25.700 --> 57:26.820
Tell us-

57:27.060 --> 57:28.400
Thank you for coming Astaroth.

57:29.060 --> 57:31.260
We’re glad that you could join us.

57:32.760 --> 57:35.860
We were wondering if you could help us find
one of your collectors.

57:35.860 --> 57:37.900
He goes by the name of Sebastian.

57:37.900 --> 57:40.560
Now why would I give you his location?

57:40.560 --> 57:42.220
He’s my best man.

57:42.220 --> 57:43.360
Never misses.

57:44.180 --> 57:46.360
We wish to help him.

57:46.360 --> 57:47.400
We do?

57:49.440 --> 57:50.640
We do.

57:51.040 --> 57:52.400
Someone’s after him.

57:52.820 --> 57:53.860
Oh really?

57:54.300 --> 57:55.300
Who?

57:55.620 --> 57:56.600
Raquel.

57:58.140 --> 57:59.120
Raquel.

58:00.420 --> 58:03.980
You know I’m not surprised she’s trying
to beat my soul count.

58:03.980 --> 58:07.320
Last I heard she scooped the bottom of the
barrel for her latest collector.

58:07.320 --> 58:10.460
Some has been mercenary named Marcus.

58:11.940 --> 58:13.540
Very well.

58:14.460 --> 58:18.480
If you were our enemy, you wouldn’t know
how to summon me like this.

58:18.480 --> 58:23.820
He should be at the Finn Hotel tomorrow
night acquiring his next soul, Tania.

58:31.480 --> 58:35.500
You know, smoking my friend,
is good for business.

58:37.420 --> 58:38.400
Thank you.

58:44.620 --> 58:45.900
You’re a collector?!

58:47.940 --> 58:48.820
Liars!

58:51.420 --> 58:54.160
You know you really shouldn’t mess with
a demon.

58:55.740 --> 58:59.620
Don’t you realize all humans to us are just
cattle!

59:03.680 --> 59:04.820
Turn it off!

59:07.240 --> 59:09.000
Turn it off!

59:16.400 --> 59:17.660
What was that?

59:17.660 --> 59:19.340
Angels singing.

59:19.340 --> 59:20.780
Demons can’t stand it.

59:21.680 --> 59:23.220
I don’t suppose they sell that online.

59:23.220 --> 59:25.320
A gift from Ativus to
help me sleep at night.

59:30.020 --> 59:31.700
He’s taken out the entire floor security-

59:43.300 --> 59:46.220
There is one other person I blame for what
happened.

59:46.220 --> 59:47.680
And it’s you, Adams.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.420
For God’s sake.

59:49.420 --> 59:52.880
I’m sorry about your family,
but it doesn’t justify this!

59:53.120 --> 59:56.840
You swore an oath to protect this country
and you have failed it!

59:56.840 --> 01:00:01.540
Your team was supposed to find
the bomb, and they didn’t.

01:00:01.540 --> 01:00:05.240
They are the ones who failed
to protect this country.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.900
Sit back down, General.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:12.880
What is that? What are you doing?

01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:16.840
Keeping America safe.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:21.440
One asshole at a time.

01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:32.520
Tough day at work?

01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:38.700
Just take a seat.

01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.600
What’s your name?

01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.360
Tania.

01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:49.020
Lovely name.

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:50.840
Look Tania.

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:52.420
You signed a contract some time
ago.

01:00:53.880 --> 01:00:56.380
And someone is coming to collect your soul.

01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.220
How do you know about that?

01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:01.440
What’s going on here?

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:03.040
Don’t worry, you’ll be safe.

01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.980
I’ll be taking your place instead.

01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:06.260
Who are you?

01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.480
My name’s Kristen.

01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.800
I’m really sorry about this.

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:20.140
Did we really have to knock her out?

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:23.560
The less variables in a mission the
better.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.660
She’s a liability, even if
we’re trying to save her.

01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:29.740
You got this, right?

01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.480
Room service.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.120
What are you doing?

01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.280
You actually ordered room service?

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.000
Yes! We haven’t eaten in
forever so I thought why not?

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.100
You know, you’re compromising the mission
with all your -

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.920
Oh I love when you’re getting all tactical
with me.

01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:25.880
You can get rid of the trolley right?

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.120
Who is it?

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:45.500
Hello Ma’am, I’m with the hotel staff.

01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.540
And we wanted to let you know that
you’ve been upgraded to a new suite.

01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:50.620
And I just need
your signature.

01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.600
Just a minute.

01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:04.480
I’m sorry but we really
need that signature.

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.520
What are you doing?

01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.040
I’m not doing anything.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.520
I’d worry about her.

01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:18.360
Hand over your amulet.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.760
Its about time you saved me.

01:03:49.060 --> 01:03:51.280
Wonderful
performance Marcus.

01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280
You truly are an amazing soldier.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.360
I didn’t bring my bracelet.

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.800
Then run.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:03:59.980
I’ll meet up with you later.

01:03:59.980 --> 01:04:00.820
I’m not just going to leave you here-

01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.200
Please Kristen.

01:04:03.020 --> 01:04:03.760
Go.

01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.000
You know when I’m done with you.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.360
I’m gonna
spend some time getting to know her.

01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:15.720
Shut up.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:32.720
How’d you think that was going to go? Huh?

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.780
I told you I’d kill you.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.880
Now I’ll make good on that promise.

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.820
That was way too close.

01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:02.160
He nearly killed me.

01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:03.760
How did he find us?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:06.120
I don’t know.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.300
Alright then.

01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.940
Just got one left to go.

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:24.000
Marcus, after what you’ve been through,
would you take this job given a second chance?

01:05:25.780 --> 01:05:26.880
What do you want from me?

01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.140
Just humor me.

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:34.160
Look, I joined the army to protect
those that couldn’t protect themselves.

01:05:36.580 --> 01:05:38.200
When all that ended I...

01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.400
I found this.

01:05:39.860 --> 01:05:42.800
There are other things in life
besides working for a demon.

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:44.000
It’s not like I didn’t try.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.580
I tried the whole civilian life for awhile.

01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:48.360
I felt trapped.

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.180
Insignificant.

01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:54.100
You don’t have to constantly be proving
your worth.

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:56.700
It’s not even like that.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:58.440
Then what is it like?

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:04.180
Awfully inquisitive aren’t we?

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:04.920
Hey!

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.660
I knocked out two guys for you and I nearly
got killed by a hotel clerk.

01:06:07.660 --> 01:06:09.520
I’d like to know who I’m helping.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.760
Really?

01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:12.940
Yeah...

01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:15.920
For research purposes of course.

01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.280
Of course.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.780
If anything there is one good thing that’s
come from my job.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.800
What could that possibly be?

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.580
You.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.120
How often does that one work?

01:06:42.040 --> 01:06:43.100
Fifty fifty.

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.080
If you weren’t a mass murderer,
I’d probably go out with you.

01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:54.000
Well if you weren’t a witch.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.080
I’d probably
go out with you.

01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:00.000
Goodnight, Marcus.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.420
Goodnight.

01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:13.440
Jesus!

01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.440
I’m not the son of God.

01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:17.520
What do you want?

01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.120
Here to tell me how you can’t get involved?

01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:22.880
You’re doing very well so far without me.

01:07:23.580 --> 01:07:25.140
I came to talk actually.

01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:26.500
I was about to go to sleep.

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:30.600
Oh. I can speak to you in your
dreams too if you’d prefer.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.380
Stay out of my head.

01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.080
I can already tell what you’re thinking.

01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:39.780
It’s 3 AM Ativus.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:41.620
You still blame yourself, do you not?

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.480
For Eli, for the bomb,
for all those people.

01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:48.780
Here we go again.

01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:51.780
What do you care about what I think?

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:53.300
He cares.

01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:58.600
If He cares so much why’d He let it happen?

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.040
Why’d He let Eli’s family die.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:04.660
Why’d He let thousands die?

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:07.740
Why’d He let me get in this in the first
place?

01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:11.860
God isn’t the only one influencing human
actions.

01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:15.200
The devil right?

01:08:16.080 --> 01:08:18.000
I’ve worked with demons for years.

01:08:18.500 --> 01:08:20.060
And I’ve never met the devil.

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:21.779
I have.

01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.979
We all have.

01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.500
We knew him very well.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:30.779
Why not destroy him then
if he causes so much evil.

01:08:30.779 --> 01:08:33.880
Why didn’t God destroy the Romans before
they crucified His son?

01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.240
That’s not an answer.

01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.899
Some things you’ll have
to answer for yourself.

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:40.939
Like what happened to my parents?

01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:45.660
You know I never found out what happened to
them.

01:08:46.859 --> 01:08:48.859
Can you at least tell me that?

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:52.560
Your parents were...

01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:54.540
Amazing doctors.

01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:57.000
Who saved lives.

01:08:58.439 --> 01:09:02.300
You were three years old at the time,
playing with your favorite toy sword.

01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.960
I’m not asking for a trip down memory lane.

01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:06.640
Very well.

01:09:12.460 --> 01:09:15.880
A man consumed far too much
alcohol that Thursday night.

01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.000
He didn’t brake in time at a red light.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:24.979
The resulting collision pushed your parents
car into the intersection.

01:09:24.979 --> 01:09:26.460
Where another car hit them.

01:09:28.859 --> 01:09:31.819
Took their souls to heaven instantly.

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:35.600
I’m sorry you lost your parents so young,
Marcus.

01:09:36.359 --> 01:09:40.120
And I know that you still carry the
guilt for not being able to save them.

01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:43.260
Eli’s family or all the people
that died in the bombing.

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:47.800
But understand that it's not your fault.

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:55.040
Do not blame yourself for
what is out of your hands.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:10:00.340
All the souls you took
after that are on you.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:04.000
But you can change.

01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.660
Just because you step out of the path doesn't
mean you can't find yourself back on it again.

01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.400
Path to what?

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:28.520
Now I’m wide awake.

01:10:56.780 --> 01:11:02.500
Did you really think that a maximum security
prison would keep you safe from me?

01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.920
What the hell do you want from me now?

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:22.780
We’re going to finish what we started all
those years ago.

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:25.300
When you bombed that mall.

01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.140
You’re right.

01:11:33.620 --> 01:11:35.300
I am crazy.

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:40.400
And this time you have
nothing left to bargain with.

01:11:43.340 --> 01:11:46.320
So shut up and enjoy the show.

01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:05.060
I can’t tell you how much I’ve wanted
to do this.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.360
Oh?

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:21.220
This?

01:12:21.940 --> 01:12:23.740
It’s not very sharp.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:25.920
I dulled it.

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:28.040
To make each cut.

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.460
That much more satisfying.

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:54.000
Professor Kellerman?

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:56.600
I know who you are Marcus.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:57.880
How?

01:12:58.920 --> 01:13:01.920
It’s my business to know my competition.

01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:06.200
Today marks my twentieth year
in this “collecting” business.

01:13:10.460 --> 01:13:11.500
Take a seat.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.540
Have you met God?

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.480
Up until recently I wasn’t even sure He
existed.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.540
Then an angel appeared.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:32.140
Angels and demons.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:34.220
They’re both soldiers.

01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.960
They're not too different from you.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.900
Except one side fights for good.

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:39.740
Yes.

01:13:40.220 --> 01:13:41.720
Good and evil.

01:13:42.980 --> 01:13:46.360
You want to know the one thing I’ve learned
doing this for 20 years?

01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:50.100
There is no right and wrong.

01:13:50.940 --> 01:13:52.360
No good and evil.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.480
It’s all the same.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.560
Soldiers are the pawns
of war between nations.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:59.560
We’re the pawns in this war.

01:14:00.940 --> 01:14:02.500
Evil doesn’t exist.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.200
I’ve stared at evil multiple times.

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:08.060
And yet we’ve both worked for evil.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:12.480
We acted as facilitators, doing something
that would happen anyway.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:15.440
Oh you can tell yourself that, if it helps
you sleep at night.

01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:19.640
But you know it’s not true.

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.800
You’re not facilitating a thing.

01:14:22.540 --> 01:14:27.040
You’re murdering innocent civilians every
single day.

01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:30.740
In exchange for staying alive.

01:14:31.420 --> 01:14:33.300
Of course we aren’t.

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:38.080
We're collecting a debt that they signed
up for.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:40.960
It just so happens they
pay with their lives.

01:14:45.780 --> 01:14:48.000
You realize how stupid that sounds?

01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:52.100
We are killing people.

01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:56.960
From our perspective, its good, from their
perspective, it’s evil.

01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:00.660
So good and evil is a
matter of perspective?

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:02.180
I hope you’re teaching philosophy.

01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.780
No, it’s much simpler than that.

01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:07.920
These complex moral and religious issues,
they’re just excuses.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:11.940
They’re excuses for
limiting your decisions.

01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.660
For limiting yourself.

01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:17.620
How convenient is it that
when something good happens:

01:15:17.620 --> 01:15:20.000
"Oh that’s a miracle."
"It’s an act of God."

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.260
But then when something bad happens,
"Oh that must be, an act of the devil."

01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.800
Nobody wants to be held
responsible for anything.

01:15:28.800 --> 01:15:31.140
So good and evil, they’re just...

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:35.200
Excellent scapegoats that justify any act.

01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.820
Saving lives could never
be considered evil.

01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.460
That depends on whose lives your saving.

01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.560
Save the life of a mother, that’s great,
you’re a hero.

01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:03.920
Lets say that mother...

01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.780
Was going to blow herself
up.

01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:08.180
Kill ten other people.

01:16:08.940 --> 01:16:15.560
So now it’s okay to kill the person you
were just willing to save.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.220
Just to save more lives?

01:16:18.140 --> 01:16:22.120
So what then good and evil becomes just a
question of math?

01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.560
You’re over simplifying it.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:27.740
No, you’re over thinking it!

01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:33.420
There is nothing that is eternally good and
there is nothing that is eternally evil.

01:16:33.420 --> 01:16:39.260
They are both concepts that change relentlessly
without any parameters whatsoever.

01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.000
Take it.

01:16:58.460 --> 01:17:00.540
Continue your pointless war.

01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:08.560
Just remember that in the end...

01:17:09.620 --> 01:17:12.220
What you’re
doing makes no difference at all.

01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.360
Brilliant work you two.

01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.600
I knew if I bided my time you would do all
the work for me.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:42.600
Yes, any spells or traps you thought were
here are gone now.

01:17:43.400 --> 01:17:44.860
How did you know about this place?

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:48.700
What did I tell you when we first met?

01:17:49.300 --> 01:17:52.320
Always assume I know everything.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:56.420
Now, I’ll be taking that amulet.

01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:12.040
Does that hurt?

01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:14.500
Did you forget about our deal?

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:18.460
I let you live this long
so you could do your job.

01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:36.200
You think I’ve survived this long without
knowing how to stop people like you?

01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:40.580
Stay out of this.

01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:45.440
Seriously Marcus?

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:47.340
A knife?

01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:55.840
You sneaky little shit.

01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:10.400
I don’t need that amulet’s power to kill
you.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.280
Oh, don’t worry!

01:19:17.260 --> 01:19:19.280
I’ll make that feel
a lot better.

01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:27.300
Beg me for your life Marcus.

01:19:28.300 --> 01:19:32.000
Beg me for your life and worship me!

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:37.620
And maybe I’ll spare you.

01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:44.480
No.

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.880
What did you say?

01:20:02.020 --> 01:20:03.260
No!

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.380
I’m glad you said that.

01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.220
Goodbye Marcus.

01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:16.660
I’d leave
him alone if I were you.

01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.960
Ativus.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.760
What are you doing here?

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.020
I’d pay attention, Raquel.

01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:29.720
Stay out of this, messenger.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.940
You have no power over me.

01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:38.620
You’re right, I have no power over you.

01:20:39.540 --> 01:20:41.180
If Michael were here though...

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.860
I hate him!

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:51.740
Hey Raquel.

01:21:00.880 --> 01:21:02.200
Kristen!

01:21:03.140 --> 01:21:04.080
Are you okay?

01:21:04.820 --> 01:21:05.780
She’ll be fine.

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:08.740
Sure took your sweet time Ativus.

01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:12.520
Thought you couldn’t interfere.

01:21:12.520 --> 01:21:14.760
I cannot directly interfere with humans.

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:16.900
That’s messing with free will.

01:21:16.900 --> 01:21:19.240
But she was a demon and you renounced her.

01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:22.200
And besides, I only gave you the amulet.

01:21:22.720 --> 01:21:24.820
You handled the rest on your own.

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.560
Is Raquel dead?

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.300
No.

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:30.340
Humans can’t kill demons.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:32.600
However, she won’t be back for a long time.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:35.880
Stabbing her with the amulet in your other
hand severely weakened her.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:37.960
Would you be able to kill a demon?

01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:41.420
If God wanted me to, yes.

01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:43.600
Why didn’t you then?

01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:45.920
Because...

01:21:46.540 --> 01:21:48.400
God trusts in you.

01:21:50.300 --> 01:21:52.540
Now all that’s left to do is defeat Eli.

01:21:52.540 --> 01:21:54.320
I’ll take you to him now that you’re ready
to face him.

01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:58.800
Can you help me defeat Eli?

01:22:02.100 --> 01:22:04.200
That’s all the help you’re gonna need
from me.

01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:28.900
I’m sorry, Eli.

01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.800
I’m sorry about your family.

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.100
Those terrorists planted the bomb.

01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:38.760
Neither one of us should
carry the blame for that.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.880
An apology from you?

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.020
That's a...

01:22:43.540 --> 01:22:44.720
That’s rich.

01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.500
Doesn’t change the fact that they’re dead.

01:22:49.020 --> 01:22:50.960
You loved your family deeply.

01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.860
I understand that now.

01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:57.020
You turned it all into rage.

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.200
But what about the families you killed?

01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.380
How do you think their loved ones feel?

01:23:02.380 --> 01:23:09.360
You should understand more than anyone that
what you’re doing right now, is wrong.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.700
Well I have my reasons.

01:23:14.580 --> 01:23:16.340
You think you can save me?

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:18.500
What makes you think I want to stop?

01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:23.340
You’re just trying to talk your way out
of a fight because you know I’ll win.

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.040
You’re right about one thing,
we don’t have to fight.

01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.580
I’ve done terrible things too.

01:23:31.900 --> 01:23:33.200
But you can stop.

01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.440
Right now.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:37.900
With me.

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:44.360
You’re completely right.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.640
I’ll give you my amulet.

01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.620
Just give me a second.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.060
It’s somewhere in here...

01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:21.860
I don’t understand.

01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.760
I should be able to destroy you easily!

01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.100
You’re not the only one whose grown more
powerful.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.940
You’re too much of a softie
to have collected more souls.

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.280
How did you do it?

01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:31.800
Wouldn’t you like to know?

01:25:42.100 --> 01:25:44.020
Well if I can’t beat you...

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:46.640
Then we’re both
going to hell.

01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.560
Familiar situation isn’t it?

01:25:55.980 --> 01:25:57.620
You’ve lost Eli.

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.560
Neither of us needs to die here.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:02.960
Oh, really?

01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:11.500
You think they’ll spare me after killing
everyone I have in this amulet?

01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:14.800
That’s what I thought.

01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:27.120
Where did you come from?

01:26:27.120 --> 01:26:29.560
Would you believe an angel sent me?

01:26:31.900 --> 01:26:34.480
I deactivated your explosives while you two
were busy.

01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:36.820
Courtesy of this lovely watch.

01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:43.960
I’ve made peace with my kills.

01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.880
Have you?

01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.320
He’s out Marcus.

01:26:51.320 --> 01:26:52.900
Do you need to kill him?

01:27:06.540 --> 01:27:07.520
Softie.

01:27:17.520 --> 01:27:19.100
There’s only one thing left to do.

01:27:41.560 --> 01:27:44.280
You’ve done well Marcus.

01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:46.600
God?

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:59.300
He is nothing but a fly on
the wall compared to me.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.300
Lucifer.

01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:09.720
You humans are such brats.

01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:13.860
Here you are thinking
you have saved humanity.

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:17.360
You are nothing.

01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:20.520
Who do you think’s been running the show
all along?

01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:27.560
If you wanted it put together, why didn’t
you just do it yourself?

01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.400
The amulets were originally His creation.

01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:35.800
They can only be fused back together with
pure intentions, so...

01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:38.380
I created a threat.

01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.940
Poor sad, stupid, little Eli.

01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:49.820
Allowing himself to be so easily
manipulated by his anger. His...

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:54.240
Thirst for revenge.

01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:56.460
You turned him into this.

01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.880
Oh, I didn’t need to.

01:29:00.660 --> 01:29:04.300
Humans beings are so easily corruptible.

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:10.620
One little whisper and you
all will make yourselves fall.

01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.740
I promised him ultimate power and revenge.

01:29:21.220 --> 01:29:23.140
I made him a deal, Marcus.

01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.120
Just like you were made a deal by Raquel.

01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:31.780
Who... Who do you think was his handler?

01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.010
I told him I could bring his family back to
him if he collected all those souls.

01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:43.980
I can’t bring his family back, Marcus.

01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.200
But he would have believed anything because
he’s an idiot.

01:29:48.020 --> 01:29:49.180
Now...

01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:55.280
For the ultimate prize because I have
been waiting a very long time for this.

01:30:12.380 --> 01:30:18.240
When I first took this from Him I wanted to use
it to collect every human soul in existence.

01:30:19.900 --> 01:30:22.140
And exterminate them all at once.

01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:27.180
Human beings are mortal,
powerless, animalistic vermin.

01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:32.420
You really think that God cares
about something so weak and pathetic?

01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:37.280
I am the truth.

01:30:38.640 --> 01:30:42.700
I am the only salvation that humanity has.

01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:54.700
It won’t work.

01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:55.840
Not with you.

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:01.740
Once it is returned to it’s original state
it can not be used by you or me.

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:05.220
Because the Elder Amulet
was made by God for man.

01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:06.680
Now it’s on you, Marcus.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:10.340
You can use that amulet
for whatever you wish.

01:31:10.340 --> 01:31:12.360
There’s a catch isn’t there?

01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:13.820
No catch.

01:31:22.820 --> 01:31:24.680
You can’t harm him, brother.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:27.320
Marcus has accepted
God and has His protection.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.820
He will not let you directly interfere with
his free will.

01:31:36.140 --> 01:31:39.760
Fine, I don’t need to touch him.

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:51.260
Marcus, you don’t know the full extent of
what’s going on.

01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:57.020
Just, listen to me very carefully.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:06.280
If you release those souls your
sickness will return and you will die.

01:32:10.740 --> 01:32:15.140
Do you really think you’re going to heaven
after all the things you’ve done?

01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:22.000
Those souls are evil, most of them made a
deal to be put inside there.

01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.560
What’s the use of damning yourself to an
eternity of pain for them?

01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:32.520
When I could give you anything
and everything you’ve ever wanted.

01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:35.600
And so much more.

01:32:38.020 --> 01:32:41.060
I’m not here to bargain like he does.

01:32:41.060 --> 01:32:42.540
That’s his specialty.

01:32:43.660 --> 01:32:45.940
The choice has always been yours, Marcus.

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.960
And yours alone.

01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:54.220
You think your promises mean anything to me
after what you did to Eli?

01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:57.660
I can promise you this.

01:32:58.340 --> 01:33:01.540
You will suffer for all eternity.

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:45.620
You’ve made the biggest mistake of your
life.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:49.280
I’d kill you, but you’re as good as dead
already.

01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:07.380
Are you okay?!

01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:13.020
Just dying.

01:34:13.900 --> 01:34:15.280
I’ll be fine.

01:34:17.260 --> 01:34:19.000
What happened?

01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.080
Marcus freed all the souls.

01:34:24.140 --> 01:34:26.340
What do we do with this?

01:34:26.340 --> 01:34:27.900
Now that its over?

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.920
Keep it.

01:34:31.540 --> 01:34:32.800
As a memento.

01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.720
Of your heroics?

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:36.520
No.

01:34:37.420 --> 01:34:39.080
Of yours.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.680
Is he really gonna die?

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.300
All living bodies die.

01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:56.320
Can’t you cure him?

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.860
He made his choice.

01:35:03.380 --> 01:35:04.080
You...

01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:06.820
You already saved me Kristen.

01:35:09.420 --> 01:35:13.160
I just wish I’d met you sooner.

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.480
Hey Ativus.

01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:20.540
How about a cigarette?

01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:38.740
Stay awake.

01:35:38.740 --> 01:35:40.900
Marcus, stay awake!

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.320
Please, please.

01:36:20.640 --> 01:36:21.900
Is this heaven?

01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.600
No.

01:36:25.060 --> 01:36:26.080
Hell?

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:28.060
No, no.

01:36:30.020 --> 01:36:30.920
Limbo?

01:36:31.480 --> 01:36:36.600
We are still on earth, but this is just an
alternate state of being.

01:36:38.940 --> 01:36:40.560
So I’m not dead.

01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:43.240
Your soul never dies.

01:36:44.780 --> 01:36:46.900
God has a new job for you.

01:36:48.740 --> 01:36:50.080
What do you mean?

01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:53.260
It’s time to train you.

01:36:54.380 --> 01:36:55.780
For what?

01:36:56.660 --> 01:36:59.060
Wait, for what?

01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.040
My name’s Raquel.

01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:15.000
I heard you last night.

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.680
There’s a way out.

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:23.800
25 years of money, fame, fortune.

01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:28.760
All you need to do is sign.

01:37:37.320 --> 01:37:38.260
But...

01:37:38.520 --> 01:37:40.940
You’re supposed to fill it with your blood.

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:46.260
That’s a bit graphic don’t you think?

01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:50.400
But you’re dead.

01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.800
You’re an angel now?

01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:04.140
Not exactly.
