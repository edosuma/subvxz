00:01.990 --> 00:02.990
- Your mom is really sick.

00:02.990 --> 00:04.950
Type 2 diabetes can be fatal.

00:04.950 --> 00:06.790
- My roommate,
she's an Evangelical,

00:06.790 --> 00:08.540
and she signed me up
for this thing called

00:08.540 --> 00:10.170
"ChristianDatingForFree.com."

00:11.840 --> 00:14.220
- She doesn't even know
what sex is.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.100
I know Gypsy's not
like everyone else,

00:16.100 --> 00:17.140
and I would never do anything--

00:17.140 --> 00:19.310
- I'll thank you
to stay away from--

00:23.280 --> 00:25.540
In order to obtain
a guardianship

00:25.540 --> 00:27.160
over your daughter,

00:27.160 --> 00:29.290
we would need
to convince a judge

00:29.290 --> 00:30.670
that she's incapacitated.

00:30.670 --> 00:32.970
She says that if I walk around

00:32.970 --> 00:35.970
that I'll get sicker,
and I believed her.

00:35.970 --> 00:40.520
Yeah, I think I do have
multiple personalities.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.450
The other one is dark.
His name is Victor.

00:43.450 --> 00:44.950
- What were you doing?

00:44.950 --> 00:47.290
What are you hiding from me?

00:47.290 --> 00:50.080
- I'll just get another one.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.640
Tighter.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.140
- It's as tight
as it can go, sir.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.100
- Then I guess you're ready.

01:37.930 --> 01:40.140
Close your eyes.

01:44.570 --> 01:46.030
Now look at me.

01:48.030 --> 01:50.540
Hello, Victor.

01:50.540 --> 01:53.790
- <i>Hello, Candy.</i>

01:53.790 --> 01:56.800
- May I have some
of Daddy's sweetness?

01:56.800 --> 01:58.760
Please, sir?

01:58.760 --> 02:01.390
- <i>Yes, you may, dear.</i>

02:04.440 --> 02:05.690
- Can you feel it?

02:05.690 --> 02:08.160
<i>You're such</i>
<i>a good girl, darling.</i>

02:08.160 --> 02:10.870
Thanks, Daddy.

02:20.720 --> 02:23.480
Do you think maybe
you could look at me,

02:23.480 --> 02:25.570
like how we talked about?

02:25.570 --> 02:28.150
Eye contact?

02:29.570 --> 02:32.080
Why are you stopping?

02:32.080 --> 02:35.920
Did I do something wrong?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.630
- <i>No, it's just, um...</i>

02:38.630 --> 02:42.350
<i>do you think that Victor</i>
<i>could talk to Ruby instead?</i>

02:47.360 --> 02:49.200
- Um...

02:49.200 --> 02:51.950
maybe another time for Ruby.

02:53.660 --> 02:55.880
<i>It's almost two years now</i>

02:55.880 --> 02:58.090
<i>and we still haven't touched.</i>

02:58.090 --> 03:01.760
<i>You know, like in real life.</i>

03:02.970 --> 03:06.440
Well, absence makes
the heart grow fonder.

03:06.440 --> 03:10.490
- <i>I'm supposed to be getting</i>
<i>this promotion thing at my job.</i>

03:10.490 --> 03:15.120
<i>Maybe I could save up</i>
<i>and come and visit you.</i>

03:17.290 --> 03:20.550
- No, no, she'd never...

03:20.550 --> 03:24.350
accept you if she knew
that we went behind her back.

03:24.350 --> 03:26.230
And I can't get away from her.

03:26.230 --> 03:30.070
I told you that I've tried.

03:30.070 --> 03:34.200
If only you could just
meet her, like, normal somehow.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.330
Like...

03:39.340 --> 03:41.640
Like, what if...

03:41.640 --> 03:44.810
what if me and her, like,
went somewhere together,

03:44.810 --> 03:47.610
and then you...

03:47.610 --> 03:50.150
like, you could-- I mean,
you meet both of us

03:50.150 --> 03:52.490
like it was like
the first time.

03:54.030 --> 03:55.910
- <i>Huh.</i>

03:58.000 --> 04:00.170
<i>I'm always amazed</i>
<i>at the smartness</i>

04:00.170 --> 04:03.090
<i>of your ideas, babe.</i>

04:03.090 --> 04:06.730
<i>You just tell me</i>
<i>when and where,</i>

04:06.730 --> 04:08.980
<i>and I'll be whatever man</i>
<i>you want me to be.</i>

04:08.980 --> 04:11.610
- You would do that for me?

04:11.610 --> 04:14.200
You'd come all this way?

04:22.340 --> 04:25.720
Oh, look who woke the sun.

04:25.720 --> 04:28.100
- I had the most
wonderful dream, Mom.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.150
We went to Disneyworld,

04:31.150 --> 04:34.490
you and me, and we got
to meet Prince Charming

04:34.490 --> 04:35.530
in real life.

04:35.530 --> 04:37.290
- Mm-hmm.

04:37.290 --> 04:41.090
- Well, I mean, it kind of
got me thinking...

04:41.090 --> 04:43.260
Wouldn't it be nice
to go on a trip,

04:43.260 --> 04:45.100
like we used to do?

04:45.100 --> 04:46.890
- Oh...

04:46.890 --> 04:50.520
You know, we could--
we could go to the zoo, maybe.

04:50.520 --> 04:52.990
And, oh, you love
those funny little monkeys

04:52.990 --> 04:54.150
with the red behinds.

04:54.150 --> 04:55.620
We could go and see them.

04:55.620 --> 04:58.290
I just--

04:58.290 --> 05:01.250
- Or maybe we can go see
Dr. Harley.

05:01.250 --> 05:04.550
He-- he can change
your feeding tube.

05:04.550 --> 05:06.810
- Mm-hmm, that sounds great.

05:06.810 --> 05:09.180
Oh...

05:11.360 --> 05:13.990
- Are you sure you don't want
to try the insulin again, Mom?

05:13.990 --> 05:16.070
- No more insulin.

05:16.070 --> 05:18.200
- You could try exercising.

05:18.200 --> 05:20.500
- Help your mama down.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.800
I got to go potty.

05:25.300 --> 05:28.310
Okay, um...

05:28.310 --> 05:29.980
Oh.

05:29.980 --> 05:31.940
What if we had a friend over
for dinner?

05:31.940 --> 05:33.520
We could invite Mel.

05:33.520 --> 05:34.990
And then we could also--

05:34.990 --> 05:36.780
wouldn't it be so great
to find a new friend

05:36.780 --> 05:37.870
to have for dinner?

05:37.870 --> 05:38.870
- No.
- Wouldn't it be--

05:38.870 --> 05:40.660
No! I said no!

05:40.660 --> 05:42.960
Do you have any idea
all the things I do

05:42.960 --> 05:45.550
to keep a roof over your head?

05:45.550 --> 05:47.720
And food in your belly?

05:47.720 --> 05:49.180
Huh?

05:49.180 --> 05:52.020
Everything that I do,
everything I have,

05:52.020 --> 05:54.360
I give for you.

05:54.360 --> 05:57.990
Why is it never enough?

05:57.990 --> 06:00.830
Gypsy Rose, answer me!

06:03.130 --> 06:05.300
- It is enough, Mama.

06:05.300 --> 06:07.640
It is.

06:10.890 --> 06:12.190
- Oh, what--

06:12.190 --> 06:14.610
I'm just tired, that's all.

06:16.530 --> 06:19.830
Nobody's gonna ever do more
for you than I do.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.680
<i>Hello, romantic wife of mine.</i>

07:53.350 --> 07:55.020
<i>Are we destined</i>
<i>to be meeting soon?</i>

08:02.030 --> 08:04.080
<i>Reply soon if you can, dear.</i>

08:05.950 --> 08:07.540
We're gonna do 15.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.670
Uh, 20 for a large,

08:09.670 --> 08:11.670
10 for a small.

08:11.670 --> 08:14.010
- Thanks for giving me
a shot at this.

08:14.010 --> 08:15.850
It's so much cooler
than my old job.

08:15.850 --> 08:17.190
Yeah, man, of course.

08:17.190 --> 08:18.860
You graduated to the kitchen.

08:18.860 --> 08:20.320
We keep the oven closed

08:20.320 --> 08:23.110
'cause it takes a long while
to heat up.

08:23.110 --> 08:25.370
And it gets very, very hot.

08:25.370 --> 08:28.000
Guess I'll slide it back
on here.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.170
That's it, my man.

08:29.170 --> 08:32.970
Now, one, two, three.

08:32.970 --> 08:33.970
In she goes.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.299
It's really hot.
- Oh!

08:35.299 --> 08:37.350
Oh.

08:39.480 --> 08:41.440
It's all good, bud.
Let's try that other one.

08:45.620 --> 08:48.160
Okay.

08:48.160 --> 08:50.380
I'll get a mop.

08:54.970 --> 08:57.520
Hello, welcome
to Pizza Peddler.

08:57.520 --> 08:58.850
Two pepperonis?

08:58.850 --> 09:00.560
Yeah, we, uh-- our oven
just went down,

09:00.560 --> 09:04.200
so, uh, maybe 20,
25 minutes.

09:04.200 --> 09:07.950
- Call the Peddler!
He delivers!

09:07.950 --> 09:10.790
Call the Peddler!
He delivers!

09:13.840 --> 09:16.430
Call the Peddler!
He delivers!

09:56.590 --> 10:00.770
- Ruby needed you
so bad today.

10:00.770 --> 10:03.690
She needed you
to come save her.

10:07.200 --> 10:11.660
Look at--
look at my bruise, babe.

10:11.660 --> 10:15.130
Look what Ruby's
wicked stepmom did to her neck.

10:17.630 --> 10:20.470
<i>You can't show Victor</i>
<i>stuff like that.</i>

10:20.470 --> 10:23.060
<i>He might lose control.</i>

10:23.060 --> 10:25.070
- Oh, yeah?
And what would he do?

10:25.070 --> 10:29.070
What would Victor do?

10:29.070 --> 10:33.120
<i>He'll do violent things</i>
<i>to defend you,</i>

10:33.120 --> 10:37.050
<i>and to have your body</i>
<i>all to himself.</i>

10:37.050 --> 10:39.220
- Violent how?

10:39.220 --> 10:41.680
- <i>He'll kill whoever</i>
<i>doesn't respect you</i>

10:41.680 --> 10:43.350
<i>and treat you good.</i>

10:43.350 --> 10:46.650
- Like Ruby's wicked stepmom?

10:46.650 --> 10:48.910
Will you stab her, Daddy?

10:48.910 --> 10:52.830
Will you cut her like this?

11:15.000 --> 11:20.340
- <i>Do you think that you could</i>
<i>send me something of Ruby's?</i>

11:20.340 --> 11:22.350
<i>Like, maybe the scissors?</i>

11:22.350 --> 11:25.520
I knew you'd like that, sir.

11:29.990 --> 11:34.870
Would you actually be able
to hurt a person like that?

11:41.970 --> 11:45.350
- <i>Do you mean, like, your mom?</i>

11:48.820 --> 11:50.780
<i>Well...</i>

11:50.780 --> 11:52.450
<i>like, the good side of me</i>

11:52.450 --> 11:55.540
<i>would never do anything</i>
<i>like that.</i>

11:55.540 --> 11:59.380
<i>But don't ask Victor</i>
<i>unless you actually mean it,</i>

11:59.380 --> 12:01.630
<i>because he might just do it.</i>

12:01.630 --> 12:03.350
<i>He is a trained assassin.</i>

12:03.350 --> 12:05.270
<i>He basically kills</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

12:05.270 --> 12:07.140
<i>But only when he has to.</i>

12:07.140 --> 12:11.190
<i>Like, actual murder</i>
<i>is always plan B.</i>

12:11.190 --> 12:13.370
- Um...

12:13.370 --> 12:16.960
I was just playing.

12:20.170 --> 12:24.220
Gypsy, can you get me
my sleepy baby pills?

12:24.220 --> 12:25.770
Oh, honey.

12:25.770 --> 12:28.860
Oh, honey, how'd you get out
of your cage, huh?

12:30.940 --> 12:32.280
Ooh!

12:32.280 --> 12:35.120
Aww, you hurt your paw.

12:35.120 --> 12:37.460
Ooh, you got a splinter.

12:37.460 --> 12:40.250
Oh, shh.

12:40.250 --> 12:43.130
Where's your mama?

12:45.890 --> 12:48.810
I'm your mama now.

12:51.190 --> 12:54.910
Oh, I'm gonna fix you up.

12:58.500 --> 13:02.380
Oh, don't hate me for this.

13:02.380 --> 13:04.220
Don't worry.

13:04.220 --> 13:07.600
Yes, I'll fix that.

13:09.230 --> 13:12.480
I got to hurt you to help you.

13:17.540 --> 13:21.080
I was thinking about
what you said.

13:25.050 --> 13:27.890
About what I said.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.900
You deserve to be happy.

13:35.360 --> 13:38.790
Don't let anyone

13:38.790 --> 13:41.790
tell you otherwise.

13:45.930 --> 13:49.520
Oh, there's that new
"Cinderella" movie coming out,

13:49.520 --> 13:53.020
and...

13:53.020 --> 13:56.400
I thought maybe we could
go see it together.

13:56.400 --> 13:58.330
Really?

13:58.330 --> 14:00.450
Oh, thank you, Mom.

14:00.450 --> 14:02.040
Yeah.

14:28.090 --> 14:31.350
<i>Oh, you look</i>
<i>so handsome!</i>

14:31.350 --> 14:33.190
Just like how I pictured you.

14:33.190 --> 14:35.230
- <i>Kind of itchy.</i>

14:35.230 --> 14:37.030
- <i>Well, that's just because</i>
<i>it's new.</i>

14:37.030 --> 14:39.830
- <i>Remind me again</i>
<i>why I need to wear this?</i>

14:39.830 --> 14:43.120
- <i>Well, 'cause it was</i>
<i>your idea, silly.</i>

14:43.120 --> 14:44.750
<i>To come visit me and my mom?</i>

14:44.750 --> 14:46.800
- But that was before
we talked about--

14:46.800 --> 14:49.300
- Okay, don't you want
to make a good impression?

14:49.300 --> 14:51.430
- Yes.
- Okay.

14:51.430 --> 14:54.230
So I booked you a bus ticket

14:54.230 --> 14:57.150
to come down to Springfield
next Thursday,

14:57.150 --> 14:59.450
and the "Cinderella" movie
premiers on Friday.

14:59.450 --> 15:02.200
We're going to the 11:00 a. m.,
and I just--

15:02.200 --> 15:03.660
I think it's the perfect,

15:03.660 --> 15:05.750
perfect opportunity
for you to meet her.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.130
But you have to make sure that
you get to the theater early

15:08.130 --> 15:10.300
because, you know,
I really want to spot you

15:10.300 --> 15:13.020
<i>in the parking lot</i>
<i>before we go in and everything.</i>

15:13.020 --> 15:14.730
<i>And then you can open the door</i>
<i>for us, too,</i>

15:14.730 --> 15:16.230
<i>like a true gentleman.</i>

15:16.230 --> 15:17.980
We can also pretend
like it's our, you know,

15:17.980 --> 15:20.990
like, our first time meeting,
and...

15:20.990 --> 15:24.410
yeah, you can say--
I want you to say, like...

15:24.410 --> 15:25.880
what can you say?

15:25.880 --> 15:28.050
- I could just say hello.

15:28.050 --> 15:31.680
That's funny.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.520
Well, it has to be something
that'll impress her.

15:35.520 --> 15:37.900
Something--
- Um...

15:39.650 --> 15:41.530
- Something like--

15:41.530 --> 15:45.160
like, "No princess should ever
open her own door."

15:45.160 --> 15:48.090
Which I believe 1,000%,
by the way.

15:48.090 --> 15:53.260
- No princess should ever
open her-- wait.

15:53.260 --> 15:55.140
- No, "her own door."
That part's really important.

15:55.140 --> 15:56.560
- Her own door.
- Yeah.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.570
- <i>No princess</i>
<i>should ever open the door.</i>

15:59.570 --> 16:01.450
- Why don't you write it down?

16:01.450 --> 16:03.700
- Yep.

16:47.290 --> 16:49.790
Almost ready, Gypsybug?

17:01.150 --> 17:03.400
Oh.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.790
Oh, what about the dress?

17:45.030 --> 17:47.660
- One adult and one youth.
- What show?

17:47.660 --> 17:48.830
For "Cinderella."

17:48.830 --> 17:50.580
Okay, that'll be $12, ma'am.

17:55.680 --> 17:57.340
Thank you.

18:03.060 --> 18:05.700
Here we go.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.570
Um, Mom?

18:07.570 --> 18:09.790
Do you think we could get
a Dr. Pepper to share?

18:09.790 --> 18:11.080
As a treat?

18:11.080 --> 18:14.840
No, it's got
too much sugar for you.

18:14.840 --> 18:17.130
- Yes, ma'am, I just thought

18:17.130 --> 18:19.640
it was less sugar than a Coke.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.400
Um...

18:25.400 --> 18:28.360
can I-- can I just get
a-- a cup of water, then?

18:28.360 --> 18:32.000
I'm sorry,
I'm just feeling thirsty.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.460
- Hello.
- Hi.

18:33.460 --> 18:34.840
- Hi.
- What can I get you?

18:34.840 --> 18:36.920
May I have
a cup of water, please?

18:36.920 --> 18:39.720
Tap will do just fine.

19:24.020 --> 19:27.150
No princess should ever
open her own door.

19:29.700 --> 19:32.660
- Excuse me?

19:32.660 --> 19:35.210
- I mean, don't--
don't you think?

19:48.820 --> 19:50.190
Oh!

19:50.190 --> 19:51.740
Look, Gypsy!

19:51.740 --> 19:54.080
Oh, we got the whole place
to ourselves.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.830
Mm-hmm.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.460
Ooh, front row seats.

19:58.460 --> 20:00.930
There.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.850
Okay.

20:14.280 --> 20:18.290
You're a princess
waiting for a princess.

20:25.260 --> 20:28.100
<i>In a world</i>
<i>that is falling apart...</i>

20:30.690 --> 20:33.320
- What do you keep looking
over your shoulder for?

20:33.320 --> 20:35.910
The screen's up here.
- Mm-hmm.

20:41.010 --> 20:44.430
<i>Their love transcended all.</i>

20:44.430 --> 20:48.270
<i>- What do you want?</i>
<i>- I want you.</i>

20:51.860 --> 20:54.070
<i>Until an ancient evil...</i>

20:55.990 --> 20:58.370
Oh.

20:58.370 --> 21:00.040
- Mom?

21:02.050 --> 21:04.680
- Mom, what are you doing?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.930
Where are you going?

21:09.020 --> 21:11.070
<i>You've been lying to me!</i>

21:11.070 --> 21:13.440
<i>I didn't want to!</i>

21:13.440 --> 21:16.160
- Mom, don't you think
that was a little rude?

21:16.160 --> 21:18.540
- Quiet.
I want to watch the previews.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.340
<i>And all hope was lost.</i>

21:22.880 --> 21:25.800
<i>Until...</i>

21:25.800 --> 21:28.060
<i>Let her go!</i>

21:49.140 --> 21:52.150
I want to see that.

21:52.150 --> 21:56.070
<i>Against all odds...</i>

21:56.070 --> 21:59.290
Hey.

21:59.290 --> 22:00.790
Hi.

22:00.790 --> 22:02.290
Cut it out!

22:02.290 --> 22:04.550
- Mom, what are you--

22:04.550 --> 22:05.590
why are we leaving?

22:05.590 --> 22:07.680
What are you doing?

22:07.680 --> 22:08.890
Mom, no!

22:08.890 --> 22:10.470
I liked that spot!
I wanted to stay there!

22:10.470 --> 22:12.020
Mom!

22:16.610 --> 22:19.370
- Here.

22:19.370 --> 22:21.330
- Mom, what did you
do that for?

22:21.330 --> 22:25.170
Shh,
I'm trying to watch this.

22:25.170 --> 22:28.300
I can't see good.
I like to sit right up front.

22:28.300 --> 22:31.480
Well, this time
we're sitting further back.

22:49.600 --> 22:53.560
<i>This summer, love fights back.</i>

23:03.710 --> 23:05.710
<i>I'm all alone here.</i>

23:05.710 --> 23:09.470
<i>My darling,</i>
<i>I won't leave you here forever.</i>

23:12.350 --> 23:16.320
<i>And at the edge of the world,</i>

23:16.320 --> 23:18.320
<i>they have to hang on.</i>

23:18.320 --> 23:20.660
<i>But what if</i>
<i>I never see him again?</i>

23:20.660 --> 23:21.990
<i>I didn't even kiss...</i>

23:21.990 --> 23:24.710
<i>And now enjoy the feature presentation.</i>

23:32.180 --> 23:33.930
- I go to go to the bathroom.

23:33.930 --> 23:35.810
- Okay--
- No, Mom, I can go by myself.

23:35.810 --> 23:37.230
- What? Uh...

23:37.230 --> 23:39.740
- Do you want me to go get you
another popcorn?

23:39.740 --> 23:43.080
- Oh, you're so sweet, hon.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.830
No, I'm okay.

23:44.830 --> 23:47.170
Okay,
I'll be right back.

23:47.170 --> 23:49.260
- Oh, but hurry back, okay?

23:49.260 --> 23:51.180
Or you're gonna miss
what happen.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.850
Okay.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.670
Go.

24:30.050 --> 24:32.220
The bathroom.
Go, go wait.

24:32.220 --> 24:34.510
Wait for me.

25:42.690 --> 25:45.700
- I don't think your mom
likes me very much.

25:46.820 --> 25:48.540
- Can we please just
forget about her

25:48.540 --> 25:52.710
for one teeny,
tiny second?

25:55.170 --> 25:58.470
I just really want
to appreciate the handsome,

25:58.470 --> 26:01.230
loving man who came
all this way to see me.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.070
- You are the most
beautiful woman

26:03.070 --> 26:04.530
that I've ever seen.

26:04.530 --> 26:06.820
You're even more beautiful
in real life

26:06.820 --> 26:08.280
than you are on Facebook.

26:10.080 --> 26:11.920
- And I always try
to be honest,

26:11.920 --> 26:13.880
so I wouldn't lie
about a thing like that.

26:16.760 --> 26:20.100
- I just want to hold you,
and touch you,

26:20.100 --> 26:23.860
and be the man to give you
your first ever kiss.

26:23.860 --> 26:26.280
- Wait.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.760
Now you can kiss me.

26:39.760 --> 26:43.480
<i>Do they treat you well?</i>

26:43.480 --> 26:46.030
<i>Better than I deserve,</i>
<i>most likely.</i>

26:46.030 --> 26:47.070
<i>And you?</i>

26:47.070 --> 26:48.070
<i>They treat me as well as...</i>

26:48.070 --> 26:49.530
- Oh...

26:49.530 --> 26:51.700
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

26:51.700 --> 26:54.590
<i>It's not so very bad.</i>

27:34.620 --> 27:38.920
- Was it pretty much everything
you dreamed it would be?

27:38.920 --> 27:40.840
- Yes.

27:40.840 --> 27:43.470
Because I dreamed
that it would be...

27:43.470 --> 27:45.390
perfect.

27:45.390 --> 27:48.230
And it actually is.

27:54.200 --> 27:57.040
We don't have much time.

27:57.040 --> 28:00.170
- Have you seen a little girl
in a wheelchair?

28:00.170 --> 28:02.550
- Yeah, she went into the
bathroom a couple minutes ago.

28:02.550 --> 28:04.430
Oh...

28:27.810 --> 28:32.200
- Okay, um-- so just--
is it--

28:32.200 --> 28:35.290
- Yep.
Okay.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.410
- Okay.
Ready?

28:54.410 --> 28:56.910
Ah!
Slower, slower, slower.

28:56.910 --> 28:58.580
Okay, sorry.
You okay?

28:58.580 --> 29:00.090
- Yeah.
You okay?

29:00.090 --> 29:02.170
Mm-hmm.

29:29.060 --> 29:32.730
- Did-- did you--
was I good?

29:32.730 --> 29:35.620
Yeah.

29:35.620 --> 29:37.660
- Was I?

29:41.500 --> 29:43.710
You were perfect.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.580
- Oh.

29:57.580 --> 29:59.700
Oh.

30:07.720 --> 30:09.640
Hello.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.280
Oh, I missed you.

30:25.340 --> 30:28.800
- Oh, that was so romantic,
wasn't it, Mom?

30:28.800 --> 30:31.480
Oh, my gosh, did you enjoy it
as much as I did?

30:31.480 --> 30:34.520
Oh, yeah, it was good.

30:34.520 --> 30:37.110
- I'm so glad that I wore
my princess dress after all.

30:37.110 --> 30:38.240
Yeah.

30:38.240 --> 30:39.740
- Can we see
another movie soon?

30:53.230 --> 30:54.560
Oh.

30:54.560 --> 30:56.780
- No princess should ever
open her own door.

30:56.780 --> 30:57.950
- Oh, thank you--

30:57.950 --> 31:00.530
Wait. Mom, wait.

31:00.530 --> 31:04.170
- Um, did you guys
enjoy "Cinderella"?

31:04.170 --> 31:08.130
- What the hell do you care
if we enjoyed "Cinderella"?

31:08.130 --> 31:10.430
- Mom.
- I just, um--

31:10.430 --> 31:11.930
- Who are you?

31:11.930 --> 31:14.480
- Um--
well, um...

31:14.480 --> 31:16.650
- Who follows a mom
and her sick daughter

31:16.650 --> 31:18.150
around a movie theater?

31:18.150 --> 31:20.410
You're a creep!

31:20.410 --> 31:23.000
What's your name?

31:24.750 --> 31:27.590
I want to know,
what is your name?

31:30.220 --> 31:32.390
Stay away from my daughter!

31:32.390 --> 31:34.230
Wait, no, no...

31:34.230 --> 31:36.520
You-- you didn't have
to yell at him like that.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.230
He could just be
a really nice person.

31:38.230 --> 31:41.320
He was-- why don't we just go
back and talk to him and see--

31:41.320 --> 31:43.830
- What? I would never let you
talk to someone like that!

31:43.830 --> 31:46.670
- But we could just see
if he was nice or something!

31:46.670 --> 31:48.250
He's not nice!

31:48.250 --> 31:49.300
- He could be--
- Gypsy!

31:49.300 --> 31:51.090
That is what a pedophile
looks like.

31:51.090 --> 31:52.260
He could be
a new friend.

31:52.260 --> 31:53.260
No!

32:48.790 --> 32:52.340
- You ever see
that boy before?

32:52.340 --> 32:54.600
- What boy?

32:58.940 --> 33:01.530
Oh, um...

33:01.530 --> 33:02.780
no, no.

33:02.780 --> 33:05.200
I-- I don't think I've ever...

33:05.200 --> 33:06.700
met him before.

33:06.700 --> 33:08.870
He seemed nice, but I--

33:08.870 --> 33:11.960
I don't know where
we would have ever met him.

33:11.960 --> 33:15.140
Unless we forgot something.

33:15.140 --> 33:17.310
So...

33:17.310 --> 33:20.520
probably not.

33:33.010 --> 33:35.970
I'm gonna go change
out of my dress.

34:34.800 --> 34:37.090
Hello?

34:41.310 --> 34:44.730
Hello?

34:44.730 --> 34:47.780
<i>May I speak</i>
<i>to Mrs. Blanchard, please?</i>

34:50.370 --> 34:52.370
- Who is this?

34:52.370 --> 34:54.920
<i>Well, basically,</i>
<i>I am the man</i>

34:54.920 --> 34:56.670
<i>who is in love with</i>
<i>your daughter Gypsy Rose,</i>

34:56.670 --> 34:58.430
<i>and I have been</i>
<i>for several years now,</i>

34:58.430 --> 34:59.970
<i>to be honest with you.</i>

34:59.970 --> 35:01.310
- What?

35:03.440 --> 35:07.070
- Me and Gypsy don't have
any secrets from each other.

35:12.120 --> 35:15.330
- I'll call the police on you,
I swear to God.

35:18.050 --> 35:20.180
- I am always going
to love Gypsy,

35:20.180 --> 35:22.680
and she loves me back.

35:22.680 --> 35:27.150
Also I'm the father of
her future children, probably,

35:27.150 --> 35:29.150
and there's nothing
that you can do about it.

35:29.150 --> 35:30.660
- Don't you dare.

35:30.660 --> 35:33.710
Oh, and furthermore,
you don't talk to me that way.

35:33.710 --> 35:36.590
Ever.

35:36.590 --> 35:37.630
<i>Who do you think you are--</i>

35:45.310 --> 35:47.320
Who was that?

35:49.110 --> 35:50.950
- Oh.

35:50.950 --> 35:54.580
Oh, just someone...

35:54.580 --> 36:00.340
oh, calling to sell some crap
and looking for a sucker.

36:00.340 --> 36:02.220
Mm.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.850
<i>I love you, hun.</i>
<i>Be strong.</i>

36:24.850 --> 36:27.400
<i>We will be reunited somehow.</i>

36:31.780 --> 36:33.620
Gypsy?

36:33.620 --> 36:37.370
Come back here.

36:37.370 --> 36:39.630
- Yes, mama.

39:41.700 --> 39:44.500
Are you ready for dinner?

39:55.060 --> 39:59.280
Are you gonna be...

39:59.280 --> 40:02.620
a good girl now?

40:49.040 --> 40:52.550
- I finally let myself accept
that you are my everything.

40:54.180 --> 40:56.310
I will go with you...

40:56.310 --> 41:00.440
and live our dream.

41:00.440 --> 41:03.740
- Are you sure?

41:03.740 --> 41:08.250
- I am 100,000% in, hon.

41:09.840 --> 41:12.210
I'm ready, truly.

41:14.760 --> 41:18.640
She's never gonna let us
be together, she said so.

41:18.640 --> 41:23.450
- That's her choice.
She made that.

41:23.450 --> 41:27.080
- It will be...

41:27.080 --> 41:29.830
an act of kindness.

41:29.830 --> 41:32.710
We just have to do it
like we said.

41:32.710 --> 41:35.850
- Okay, but...

41:35.850 --> 41:39.810
my good side
is still here with me.

41:39.810 --> 41:42.650
You can't ask him
or else he'll say no.

41:44.780 --> 41:47.240
You have to ask Victor.

42:01.810 --> 42:05.240
- Victor...

42:05.240 --> 42:09.960
will you please
kill my mother for me?

42:09.960 --> 42:12.540
Because I can't do it myself.

42:41.270 --> 42:43.060
Oh, my feet.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.860
I feel like I'm walking
on pins and needles.

42:50.450 --> 42:53.960
I'm gonna make you
your favorite tonight.

42:53.960 --> 42:56.420
Mashed potatoes.

42:58.590 --> 43:00.720
- Sounds delicious.

43:02.770 --> 43:05.150
I make it...

43:05.150 --> 43:08.410
with real milk.

43:08.410 --> 43:11.200
- Oh, I think I drank
my water too fast, Mom.

43:11.200 --> 43:12.500
I have to go
to the ladies' room,

43:12.500 --> 43:14.920
but I'll be right back, okay?

43:14.920 --> 43:17.970
- Oh, no, wait.

43:17.970 --> 43:20.050
Oh, my feet.
Wait.

44:10.280 --> 44:15.040
Hey, hon.
You looking to buy a present?

44:15.040 --> 44:16.250
Yeah, actually.

44:16.250 --> 44:18.210
It's, um-- my dad's birthday
is coming up.

44:18.210 --> 44:19.510
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

44:19.510 --> 44:21.340
- Is he a deer hunter?

44:21.340 --> 44:23.850
Same here.

44:23.850 --> 44:26.270
- Um, what's the--

44:26.270 --> 44:29.940
the best knife to use
on a really, um...

44:29.940 --> 44:31.200
a really big deer?

44:31.200 --> 44:32.990
Well, let's see.

44:32.990 --> 44:35.960
Me personally, I like to use
a 6- or 8-inch blade.

44:35.960 --> 44:37.120
Gypsy?

44:37.120 --> 44:39.880
It doesn't turn
if you hit bone.

44:39.880 --> 44:44.180
So you've still got the option
of a clip point,

44:44.180 --> 44:49.190
which is the perfect shape
blade for penetration.

44:49.190 --> 44:52.910
Or you can get a drop point,
which is better for skinning.

44:55.700 --> 44:59.130
- Probably the penetration one.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.170
That still leaves the
question of fixed or folding.

45:02.170 --> 45:04.220
Fixed is probably better.

45:04.220 --> 45:08.270
It's a little
more difficult to transport.

45:08.270 --> 45:11.110
It's a lot more reliable
for heavy duty work.

45:11.110 --> 45:14.910
And you're gonna need
a non-slip handle.

45:14.910 --> 45:16.870
'Cause you're doing
some serious gutting,

45:16.870 --> 45:19.000
that blade's gonna get
mighty slippery.

45:19.000 --> 45:22.300
You don't want to go
slicing your palm up.

45:22.300 --> 45:23.880
So...

45:23.880 --> 45:28.980
I would recommend
either a Ambush Tundra...

45:28.980 --> 45:32.230
or maybe
a Cross River Mountain Man.

45:34.070 --> 45:36.120
- I want that one.

45:36.120 --> 45:38.540
With the red.

45:38.540 --> 45:41.130
- Honey, that's
a fishing knife.

45:42.340 --> 45:45.590
- He likes fishing too.

45:58.330 --> 46:00.540
Oh...

46:10.480 --> 46:12.440
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

46:12.440 --> 46:14.570
- That's the one.

46:14.570 --> 46:17.700
Okay.
Jimmy will ring you up.

47:09.180 --> 47:11.180
- Oh!

47:13.060 --> 47:15.060
What were you doing?

47:15.060 --> 47:18.240
- You weren't in the bathroom!

47:18.240 --> 47:20.530
- I'm sorry, I just-- I had
to tell a little fib.

47:20.530 --> 47:22.410
I...

47:22.410 --> 47:24.790
I saw this
when we came in the mall

47:24.790 --> 47:27.630
and I really wanted
to get it for you.

47:27.630 --> 47:29.510
- You scared me half to death.

47:29.510 --> 47:32.100
- It reminds me of us.

47:33.730 --> 47:35.060
- I love it.

47:36.900 --> 47:39.950
You're gonna have
to wheel yourself.

47:43.540 --> 47:46.540
That was too much.

47:46.540 --> 47:48.050
I'm sorry.

48:00.200 --> 48:02.830
<i>That's for motivation,</i>
<i>darling.</i>

48:02.830 --> 48:04.750
- <i>That is pretty great</i>
<i>motivation.</i>

48:06.840 --> 48:09.550
But basically,
the deed has to wait

48:09.550 --> 48:13.140
until Victor has enough money
saved up for the motel.

48:13.140 --> 48:15.730
Know what?

48:15.730 --> 48:18.860
Just let me worry
about the motel, okay?

48:18.860 --> 48:22.910
You just worry about
getting Victor on that bus

48:22.910 --> 48:24.160
and getting him down here.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.500
Can you do that?

48:31.680 --> 48:33.930
- Uh, yep.

48:37.690 --> 48:39.190
- Tomorrow night.

48:39.190 --> 48:42.280
Tomorrow night.

48:42.280 --> 48:45.790
Tonight is the last night
we sleep alone.

49:16.890 --> 49:19.810
<i>I should ask you this</i>
<i>before Victor has to.</i>

49:19.810 --> 49:22.400
<i>Is your mom a light</i>
<i>or deep sleeper?</i>

50:08.330 --> 50:11.170
- Ow.

50:17.930 --> 50:20.140
Oh, Gypsy, get in your chair.

50:20.140 --> 50:23.520
Someone could see you.

50:23.520 --> 50:25.400
- No one can see us, Mom.

50:38.220 --> 50:41.230
Oh, don't hurt me.

50:44.190 --> 50:46.190
- I'll be careful.

51:05.940 --> 51:08.620
- How about I paint your nails,
hmm?

51:08.620 --> 51:11.240
Maybe, um...

51:11.240 --> 51:13.920
What if--
maybe a dark pink?

51:16.760 --> 51:19.970
Oh, oh, everything's swollen.

51:24.440 --> 51:27.190
I haven't seen you wear
grandma's ring in a while.

51:30.320 --> 51:32.120
Here.

51:34.210 --> 51:35.880
Oh...

51:49.110 --> 51:51.580
Your crown.

52:09.780 --> 52:12.070
What's the matter?

52:14.870 --> 52:18.000
- I think you might have been
right about my feeding tube.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.510
Oh.

52:19.510 --> 52:21.800
- Is it too late
to go in today?

52:43.560 --> 52:47.940
- Before you know it,
you'll be a brand new girl.

52:47.940 --> 52:49.440
- Upsies, here we go.

52:49.440 --> 52:50.690
Here we go.

52:50.690 --> 52:53.490
Up.

52:53.490 --> 52:55.200
All right.

52:55.200 --> 52:58.040
Ladies, always a pleasure.

52:58.040 --> 52:59.500
Try to stay out of trouble.

52:59.500 --> 53:01.920
Oh, trouble knows
it's not welcome here.

53:21.050 --> 53:23.720
- Oh, I...

53:23.720 --> 53:26.890
I think I owe you an apology.

53:29.400 --> 53:32.860
The other day at the movies...

53:35.030 --> 53:37.500
You asked for a Dr. Pepper,

53:37.500 --> 53:40.330
and I said no.

53:40.330 --> 53:43.680
I should have let you
have a sip.

53:54.740 --> 53:57.660
<i>Sir, will you text me</i>
<i>when you are at the door</i>

53:57.660 --> 54:00.500
<i>with the gloves on?</i>

54:54.320 --> 54:56.950
Aww...

55:01.830 --> 55:05.420
Did you look up
at the sky tonight?

55:11.730 --> 55:14.770
And what did you see?
