00:49.049 --> 00:51.385
‐ Tom! Come on! Come on! Come on!

00:51.802 --> 00:54.012
‐ This one's got an attitude!

01:03.230 --> 01:05.065
‐ Thankfully,

01:05.065 --> 01:07.192
domes are the strongest
structures on Earth.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.320
‐ What's that mean?

01:12.906 --> 01:14.157
Unlike most quakes,

01:14.157 --> 01:15.576
the epicenter of ours

01:15.576 --> 01:18.620
moves in a line,
activating faults as it goes.

01:18.620 --> 01:21.707
Usually down the fissure,
away from ICARIS.

01:21.707 --> 01:24.668
But this last quake shifted
the ground directly beneath us,

01:24.668 --> 01:26.962
and another quake could fracture the wall,

01:26.962 --> 01:29.548
dropping ICARIS and Rakke Town
into the chasm.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.468
And all of us with it.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.761
‐ So, what do we do?

01:35.470 --> 01:36.930
‐ We blow it up.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.433
‐ That's crazy. You're crazy. She's crazy.

01:39.433 --> 01:42.269
‐ Linda. Olivia's last crazy idea

01:42.269 --> 01:45.230
predicted this fissure
and gave us all jobs.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.316
Crazy away, Olivia.
Thanks, May.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.027
We send a manned probe

01:50.027 --> 01:53.488
a couple miles into the fissure,
near the endpoint of the last quake.

01:53.488 --> 01:56.116
Then, we deploy explosives
to blast that spot,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.328
and I believe that will stop
whatever is creating these tremors.

01:59.328 --> 02:02.956
‐ Seems to me that's just a faster
way to collapse everything.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.042
‐ There are no caves under the station.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.461
It's why we chose to build
ICARIS on this spot.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.755
So, I believe it will remain stable.

02:09.755 --> 02:12.174
Some of the caves in
the area will collapse, yes,

02:12.174 --> 02:14.009
but that won't affect us.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.886
‐

02:15.886 --> 02:17.471
They said at Corporate,

02:17.471 --> 02:19.890
"Olivia's planning on
detonating the fissure."

02:20.432 --> 02:22.601
I didn't believe it.

02:22.601 --> 02:24.353
I should've known better.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.688
‐
Oh man. Not her.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.650
‐ Dr. Sledkin. I didn't know
you were coming.

02:29.650 --> 02:31.151
‐ That makes two of us.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.153
‐ They sent her in case I fail.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.073
‐ Or to talk some sense
into you <i>before</i> you fail.

02:36.073 --> 02:38.575
‐ Olivia has never steered us wrong.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.953
If she says it will work, I trust her.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.329
‐ I do, too.

02:42.329 --> 02:45.123
‐ I hope for everyone's sake
that you're both right.

02:45.624 --> 02:47.626
‐ When can you be ready, Dr. Kullersen?

02:47.626 --> 02:49.294
‐ First light.

02:49.294 --> 02:54.424
‐ Then you drop in the probe at dawn.
‐ Uh‐uh. <i>We</i> drop in the probe at dawn.

02:54.883 --> 02:55.884
Okay, everyone.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.053
Back to work. We have a mission to plan.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.181
‐ Fingers crossed.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.102
‐ Okay, this is crazy. Our folks
are gonna blow up the fissure!

03:05.102 --> 03:08.105
How is that a good idea?
‐ Tom, this <i>is</i> crazy.

03:08.105 --> 03:11.942
‐ If my mom says it's the only way
to save ICARIS, it's the only way.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.194
Come on. We gotta go check on the dragons.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.946
Sledkin.

03:15.946 --> 03:19.324
I figured you'd show up eventually.
You always loved the spotlight.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.159
‐ This isn't about me, Kullersen.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.288
We're not in college anymore,
competing for lab time,

03:24.288 --> 03:26.748
dreaming of winning the Vetlesen Prize.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.376
This is about ICARIS falling
into the fissure,

03:29.376 --> 03:31.336
and all
the Rakke Corporation's money with it.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.213
This is about the people who will die,

03:33.213 --> 03:34.965
and all the lawsuits that will follow.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
‐ The <i>people</i> are my only concern.

03:36.967 --> 03:38.677
‐ You work for the company now.

03:38.677 --> 03:40.679
It should <i>all</i> be your concern.

03:45.309 --> 03:47.811
‐ You got this, Mom.
‐ Thanks, boyo.

03:52.691 --> 03:55.152
Plowhorn!
Feathers!

03:55.152 --> 03:57.779
Wu! Wei!

03:59.489 --> 04:00.490
‐ Whoa...

04:01.241 --> 04:02.743
The earthquake do that?

04:03.577 --> 04:05.954
‐ I'm glad nobody was
standing underneath it.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.665
‐ Yeah. This is another good reason

04:08.665 --> 04:10.125
to never leave my room.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.711
‐ Wait. Wait, that's where Thunder sleeps.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.046
Thunder? Thunder!

04:17.216 --> 04:19.343
You okay, pal?

04:19.343 --> 04:20.594
‐ Plowhorn?

04:21.220 --> 04:23.055
Aw! Come here, girl!

04:23.055 --> 04:24.723
That mean earthquake freak you out?

04:27.893 --> 04:30.187
Wu and Wei are shaken up, too.

04:30.187 --> 04:31.563
‐ Where's Feathers?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.274
Feathers!

04:34.274 --> 04:36.777
Whoa! Feathers! You're alive!

04:37.486 --> 04:39.821
Uh, okay. Too much too soon.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.407
I'm a walker, not a flyer.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.245
‐ Tom, what are we gonna do?

04:46.245 --> 04:49.581
Your mom said blasting the fissure
could collapse the caves around here.

04:51.542 --> 04:53.210
‐ We send them into the Hidden World.

04:53.210 --> 04:56.380
At least temporarily.
They'll obviously be safer there.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.506
‐ Are you sure?

04:57.923 --> 05:00.509
‐ Of course I'm sure!
It's certainly safer than here.

05:00.509 --> 05:03.637
And when the explosions stabilize
the fissure, we can go and get them back.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.639
‐ Why don't we go with them?

05:06.139 --> 05:07.641
Oh...

05:07.641 --> 05:10.060
Because if the caves <i>do</i> collapse...

05:10.060 --> 05:13.021
‐ But, they won't.
This is just a precaution.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.742
You have to go.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.787
You have to lead Wu, Wei, Plowhorn,
and Feathers back to the Hidden World.

05:29.872 --> 05:30.956
It's not safe for you here.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.917
Yeah. You know, don't you?

05:33.917 --> 05:36.211
Things are falling too close
for comfort, buddy.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.755
So, take the others
just for a little while.

05:42.217 --> 05:45.053
‐ Yeah. Just for a little while.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.806
‐ Just for a little while.
And while you're gone,

05:47.806 --> 05:50.017
you watch yourself, girl,
because, sometimes,

05:50.017 --> 05:52.436
you're just too sweet and gentle

05:52.436 --> 05:54.771
for that crazy world out there.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.525
‐ I wish I could disappear with you.

06:47.449 --> 06:50.536
‐ I can't believe we just said
goodbye to our dragons.

06:50.536 --> 06:52.663
‐ Yeah. Maybe for good.

06:52.663 --> 06:56.416
‐ Hey! Hey, guys, come on.
My mom's plan will work. You'll see.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.876
Whoa!

07:07.678 --> 07:09.346
‐ It's a dragon.

07:09.346 --> 07:12.266
This whole time, a dragon
has been causing the quakes!

07:12.266 --> 07:15.727
‐ Of course! The giant hole in
the wall, the collapsed crystals,

07:15.727 --> 07:17.020
the moving epicenter...

07:17.020 --> 07:18.730
‐ That's why my mom
couldn't figure it out!

07:18.730 --> 07:19.940
No one knows it exists!

07:19.940 --> 07:21.775
‐ We <i>gotta</i> tell our parents now.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.278
If they go down there
and start blasting the fissure,

07:24.278 --> 07:27.281
that giant Fault Ripper dragon
might eat them alive!

07:27.281 --> 07:30.117
‐ Yeah. The secret's not as
important as your parents' lives.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.578
‐ Wait, wait, wait!
What if there's another way?

07:32.578 --> 07:35.414
A way to chase off
the Fault Ripper, save our parents,

07:35.414 --> 07:37.082
<i>and</i> keep the secret.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.917
But we're gonna need our dragons.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.420
‐ Didn't we <i>just</i> send them back?

07:44.882 --> 07:48.218
<i>Alright. I'll be your eyes and ears.</i>

07:49.261 --> 07:51.638
You guys get to the probe and go down

07:51.638 --> 07:53.640
and get our dragons back.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.481
‐ Alex, we need help with the guard.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.441
‐ Copy that.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.214
<i>I've just uploaded
the instructions to your main screen.</i>

08:27.341 --> 08:29.551
‐ Yeah, you look all happy now.

08:35.516 --> 08:38.435
Okay. Down to dragon land.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.316
My bad.

08:44.316 --> 08:47.194
Wrong button.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.782
Oh yeah. This is more like it.

08:52.533 --> 08:53.617
<i>After we get the dragons,</i>

08:53.617 --> 08:54.868
<i>we'll meet back in the lair.</i>

08:54.868 --> 08:56.745
Then we'll all chase
away the Fault Ripper.

08:56.745 --> 08:57.746
D'<i>Roger that.</i>

08:59.456 --> 09:01.083
<i>Good luck.</i>

09:01.083 --> 09:02.709
Like, seriously. I'm not being sarcastic,

09:02.709 --> 09:04.461
even though it sounds like I am.

09:04.461 --> 09:07.256
I hope you to see you
at the lair... with Feathers.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.882
Don't forget about Feathers!

09:08.882 --> 09:11.301
‐ We won't. See you at the lair.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.767
‐ Blackouts and another
false alarm, Chief.

09:18.767 --> 09:19.768
There's a virus in our system.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.062
‐ Hm...

09:24.606 --> 09:27.651
‐ We've reached the lava falls, D.
<i>Wow, you got down there fast.</i>

09:27.651 --> 09:31.196
<i>How's it look at night?</i>
‐ Even more amazing than during the day.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.574
What an incredible place we live in.

09:33.574 --> 09:35.951
<i>Let's hope we get to</i> keep on <i>living here.</i>

09:35.951 --> 09:38.078
<i>And yes, I meant that both ways.</i>

09:42.207 --> 09:45.460
‐ Uh, Tom? What's that?
‐ I don't know.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.797
But, it looks like
it's coming right at us.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.299
Shh...

09:55.929 --> 09:58.056
Can it see us?
‐ I don't think so.

09:58.056 --> 10:01.476
It's a burrower.
It doesn't need good eyesight.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.729
‐ That's good, I guess.

10:03.729 --> 10:05.397
Ah!
‐ Shh!

10:09.818 --> 10:11.820
Look at the size of those ear holes.

10:12.404 --> 10:14.156
It must hunt by sound.

10:14.156 --> 10:16.158
Then maybe, we should shut up.

10:37.012 --> 10:39.556
‐ I took out the virus,

10:39.556 --> 10:41.600
but it did its damage.

10:45.145 --> 10:48.649
‐ Then that gives you something
to do, doesn't it, Linda?

10:48.649 --> 10:51.527
‐ Cameras are down
on the platform.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.403
I'll go check it out.

10:53.403 --> 10:56.949
D'<i>Hey, you guys? We're almost out of cable.</i>

10:59.368 --> 11:01.245
Correction. We are out.

11:01.245 --> 11:03.163
We're gonna have to jump for it.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.165
The dragon world is just
around that corner.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.793
‐ But we're too far from the wall.

11:11.630 --> 11:13.882
D, use the crane to swing the probe.

11:13.882 --> 11:15.425
We're gonna jump for it.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.094
‐ Are you nuts?

11:17.094 --> 11:18.720
What am I saying? Of course he's nuts.

11:25.561 --> 11:27.145
It's still too far!

11:27.145 --> 11:28.772
‐ D! Swing us closer!

11:28.772 --> 11:31.233
Keep your eyes open.
‐ Uh‐oh.

11:31.233 --> 11:33.861
You two are on your own.
I gotta bug out. Over!

11:38.532 --> 11:41.827
‐ Hey! Why isn't the probe secure?

11:49.960 --> 11:53.088
‐ Someone's bringing us back up!
It's now or never!

12:04.183 --> 12:07.019
Okay. Yeah. That was nuts.

12:07.019 --> 12:10.022
‐ So, let's get to the cave
and the dragons. We're losing time.

12:16.278 --> 12:19.656
‐ Somebody is messing with me,

12:19.656 --> 12:22.034
and when I find out who it is,

12:22.034 --> 12:23.535
I'm gonna squash 'em.

12:23.535 --> 12:27.164
Secure this thing!
And stand watch until morning!

12:40.219 --> 12:41.678
We're locked and loaded.

12:41.678 --> 12:43.639
Ready to blast this sucker.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.182
‐ Coordinates have been set.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.603
‐ You come back to me, Phillip Baker.

12:49.603 --> 12:52.272
You hear?
‐ Always.

13:06.912 --> 13:09.081
‐ That was a lot farther
than I remembered.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.584
Of course, last time,
I was flying a two‐headed dragon.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.212
‐ Come on. The dragon world is right in...

13:15.963 --> 13:18.590
Wha...
‐ Is this the wrong cave?

13:18.590 --> 13:20.759
‐ No. It just collapsed!

13:22.094 --> 13:23.887
The Fault Ripper dragon.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.973
D'Angelo! Alex! Come in!

13:28.267 --> 13:30.644
Guys! Can you hear us?

13:30.644 --> 13:34.189
‐ Tom, we can't possibly
move these boulders alone,

13:34.189 --> 13:37.067
and nobody can get to us.

13:37.067 --> 13:38.569
‐ This... is bad.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.117
We're almost there.

13:45.117 --> 13:46.785
Ready with those rockets, Phil?

13:46.785 --> 13:48.412
‐ Just gimme something to shoot at.

13:51.415 --> 13:53.125
This is the fault line

13:53.125 --> 13:55.502
where the rock has shifted.
‐ Proves your theory?

13:55.502 --> 13:57.629
‐ Makes me feel like it's less crazy.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.590
‐ Less crazy is good.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.300
Do I get to press the red button?

14:01.300 --> 14:03.969
‐ You get to press the red button.

14:20.027 --> 14:21.445
The probe is back?

14:23.030 --> 14:25.240
‐ Tom! Look out!

14:32.122 --> 14:35.209
It must've heard the explosion!
It's heading for the probe!

14:35.209 --> 14:36.877
‐ Mom...
‐ Tom!

14:36.877 --> 14:38.587
We <i>need</i> our dragons.

14:42.716 --> 14:44.510
‐ Come on, pal. Please.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.054
Hear me!

14:49.640 --> 14:51.350
Thunder!

14:53.310 --> 14:56.313
‐ You think that worked?
‐ We'll only know if the quakes stop.

15:02.069 --> 15:04.613
‐ I guess it didn't!

15:09.952 --> 15:11.453
‐ Bring it up. Bring it up!

15:15.165 --> 15:17.668
‐ No go! It's stuck on something!

15:19.962 --> 15:23.173
‐ Thunder! Thunder!

15:23.882 --> 15:25.634
He's gone...

15:25.634 --> 15:27.261
I can't get to him.

15:28.887 --> 15:30.681
Mom... Mom...

15:45.654 --> 15:47.573
Thunder!

15:47.573 --> 15:50.284
No time for joyful reunions,
pal. We got work to do.

15:52.077 --> 15:54.121
Go get D and Alex from the lair.
‐ On it.

15:54.121 --> 15:55.622
‐ We're gonna save the parents.

16:09.261 --> 16:10.804
Get outta here!

16:17.227 --> 16:18.645
Ah!

16:22.441 --> 16:24.067
Whoa!

16:30.657 --> 16:31.950
‐ What the...

16:36.163 --> 16:37.539
‐ Mom...

16:41.210 --> 16:42.711
Break 'em free, Thunder!

16:46.882 --> 16:48.884
Nice shot, pal.

16:48.884 --> 16:51.094
Oh! Go, go, go!

16:53.805 --> 16:55.891
Oh! I'm open to ideas.

16:55.891 --> 16:57.893
Whoa!

17:01.813 --> 17:03.690
Chicken? That's your idea!?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.817
I didn't say I was open to bad ideas!

17:10.781 --> 17:12.616
Whoa! Ah!

17:16.161 --> 17:19.414
I know, I know. It's nobody's fault,
but we gotta be smarter about this.

17:28.257 --> 17:31.176
Or lucky! I'll settle for lucky!
You got any more speed in you?

17:34.054 --> 17:36.473
Ah! Ah!

17:38.225 --> 17:40.727
Yeah!
Woo!

17:40.727 --> 17:43.105
‐ Hey there, Kullersen! You miss us?

17:43.856 --> 17:45.399
‐ Lucky it is.

17:53.866 --> 17:57.411
No Alex?
‐ She's a walker, not a flyer, remember?

17:57.411 --> 18:00.247
‐ Alright, well we can
chase him off without her.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.710
‐ If you say so...

18:05.460 --> 18:06.920
‐ I say so.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.799
Freeze blast! D, loogie bombs!

18:10.799 --> 18:12.551
‐ You got it.
‐ Come on, Thunder.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.344
Let's give this guy a reason to leave.

18:22.102 --> 18:23.437
Ice him up, Wu!

18:32.279 --> 18:35.324
‐ Wait, what's going on?

18:35.324 --> 18:38.118
What, you can run outta juice?

18:38.118 --> 18:39.828
Ah!

18:39.828 --> 18:41.455
Whoa!

18:57.930 --> 19:00.182
Huh?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.808
Plow's outta ammo, too!

19:17.658 --> 19:19.618
Woohoo!
Go Alex!

19:19.618 --> 19:22.746
‐ Is it over? Did we win?

19:25.374 --> 19:27.334
‐ Not yet, Alex.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.044
Whoa!

19:30.712 --> 19:31.713
‐ Hit it again!

19:33.924 --> 19:36.218
‐ Again, Feathers, again!

19:41.849 --> 19:44.852
‐ Keep at it! Something about
sound is‐is messing it up.

19:52.526 --> 19:54.278
Ah! Whoa!

19:54.278 --> 19:55.946
Tom!

20:04.621 --> 20:08.000
‐ Tom!

20:10.294 --> 20:13.964
‐ Was that... my fault? Did I... do that?

20:13.964 --> 20:17.676
‐ No, Alex, no. It was nothing anyone did.

20:17.676 --> 20:19.094
Or could do.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.305
‐ Tom.

20:28.770 --> 20:30.397
Yeehaw!

20:35.485 --> 20:38.280
That... was insane!

20:39.531 --> 20:41.116
‐ Ow!

20:41.116 --> 20:43.368
‐ That's for scaring me to death.

20:43.368 --> 20:45.287
‐ But what about everything else?

20:46.997 --> 20:47.998
So,

20:47.998 --> 20:50.667
what happened to
the Fault Ripper dragon?

20:52.753 --> 20:55.130
‐ I don't know, but I hope he's okay.

21:04.556 --> 21:05.974
You did it, Olivia!

21:05.974 --> 21:07.935
The fault appears to have stabilized!

21:07.935 --> 21:12.314
‐ All I remember
is one very big boom.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.400
‐ It <i>was</i> quite the boom.
Mom!

21:15.400 --> 21:17.903
You're okay.
‐ I am. I am, honey.

21:17.903 --> 21:20.864
I'm fine. Just a little groggy.

21:23.659 --> 21:25.160
Ah...

21:25.160 --> 21:27.746
It's so weird. I...

21:27.746 --> 21:29.289
thought I saw something

21:29.289 --> 21:31.083
flying around down there.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.464
‐ Not this again.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.925
‐ Congratulations, Kullersen.

21:39.925 --> 21:41.802
This time, crazy worked.

21:44.721 --> 21:45.973
This time.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.311
In almost every ancient story,

21:51.311 --> 21:52.938
the heroes mark their territory.

21:53.522 --> 21:55.357
This is ours.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.692
‐ Our base of operations.

21:57.609 --> 21:59.778
‐ My home away from dome.

21:59.778 --> 22:00.904
‐ Our dragon's lair.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.157
‐ We are the holders of the secret

22:04.157 --> 22:07.077
and the protectors of
dragons and humans alike.

22:07.077 --> 22:10.539
‐ And this? This is finally our new home.
