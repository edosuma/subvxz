00:28.495 --> 00:31.497
Computer, where am I?

00:31.499 --> 00:35.501
You have arrived
six days into the future.

00:44.744 --> 00:47.679
And what am I looking at?

00:47.681 --> 00:50.716
Destruction of a battle.

01:02.262 --> 01:03.929
Show me.

03:21.367 --> 03:26.838
There is so much to see
when you have no sight.

03:26.840 --> 03:32.744
It's not like closing your eyes
and feeling around your house.

03:34.047 --> 03:36.114
It's a whole new world.

03:38.418 --> 03:40.852
Same as vengeance.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.456
When something like vengeance
takes over your soul.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.194
You become things you
never thought you'd become.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.830
Never believed you'd become.

03:53.266 --> 03:54.666
Murderer.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.136
Monster.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.141
Martyr.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.081
But you...

04:14.621 --> 04:19.257
See, you're in a situation
all too unfamiliar.

04:20.994 --> 04:23.662
You see, it's not just one...

04:26.099 --> 04:27.332
but two.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.601
Know where these scars
came from?

04:30.837 --> 04:34.306
It wasn't from
the well-known red rain.

04:34.308 --> 04:38.443
It was from...
People like you.

04:38.445 --> 04:42.914
People who stood
in the way of progress.

04:42.916 --> 04:49.087
Progress... my progress.

04:50.990 --> 04:56.862
This is my reminder.
Death was theirs.

04:58.197 --> 05:03.468
Although, generosity is not in
our nature, I'll give you this.

05:03.470 --> 05:07.873
I won't kill you to get to her.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.308
But...

05:10.777 --> 05:16.415
we will fulfill our job description
and remove you from this city.

05:24.524 --> 05:27.125
He will kill you.

05:27.127 --> 05:31.997
Do you realize how much
blood is on these hands?

05:31.999 --> 05:36.635
What's a few more stains?

06:10.503 --> 06:13.538
Computer, who is this?

06:28.755 --> 06:33.458
Look how busy they all are,
one moment to the next.

06:33.460 --> 06:38.463
Their lives become more dull
as they wither into nothing.

06:38.465 --> 06:43.201
But now I inject a little chaos
and look what happens.

06:43.203 --> 06:48.607
Their lives now mean something.
They have a purpose.

06:48.609 --> 06:51.643
A reason for their existence.

06:51.645 --> 06:56.515
Little do I care about these
diatribes of human existence.

06:56.517 --> 06:58.950
Where is my sister?

07:09.896 --> 07:14.566
In time.
Your entire task isn't finished.

07:14.568 --> 07:19.104
There are still more hiding out there
undercover, remaining hidden from the eye.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.774
Find them and take care
of the problem.

07:35.488 --> 07:39.658
So, where did they come from?

07:48.434 --> 07:49.868
This one?

07:50.536 --> 07:54.439
Yes, what was his power?

07:54.441 --> 08:01.780
He had this... shadow
he could... conjure.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.014
Shadow..

08:07.987 --> 08:09.588
Freeze.

08:09.590 --> 08:12.924
What innocent
is he talking about?

08:30.943 --> 08:33.178
Someone's a bit sore, eh?

08:51.063 --> 08:53.098
Is that all you've got?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.066
Who sent you?

08:55.068 --> 08:58.103
Now, you know
I can't tell you that.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.105
Who sent you?!!!

09:19.693 --> 09:21.426
One of yours?

09:26.632 --> 09:28.600
What the hell?

09:32.139 --> 09:35.006
I found
this huge chunk of metal.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.175
Look at this thing.
This could be dangerous.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.611
Yeah, I know.

09:40.012 --> 09:41.546
There we go.

09:41.548 --> 09:43.648
It fits!
That is awesome!

09:44.317 --> 09:46.418
Nice!
- Yes!

09:46.420 --> 09:48.453
Alright, let's go
find some more.

09:48.455 --> 09:50.889
You guys just made
a huge mistake.

09:50.891 --> 09:54.492
- Recycling is never a mistake.
- Do you have anything else?

09:54.494 --> 09:55.794
For the orphans.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.435
Wanna see bad?

10:19.418 --> 10:21.319
Who was that man?

10:23.756 --> 10:25.357
Markus.

10:28.094 --> 10:33.031
According to the police report,
they put the female's body...

10:33.033 --> 10:34.099
Sherry.

10:34.101 --> 10:39.004
Right, Sherry's body,
right there in the bloody area.

10:39.006 --> 10:42.807
And, uh, the assailant must have
been standing over there.

10:44.310 --> 10:49.180
Boy must have seen the assailant
and chased him out the door.

11:05.464 --> 11:07.666
What do you want now?

11:09.535 --> 11:13.905
Come on, Sherry.
Cain'll never know.

11:13.907 --> 11:18.643
Look, I don't know what kind
of tricks you're trying to pull here.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.845
But it's not gonna work.

11:20.847 --> 11:24.416
Why can't you
just understand that?

11:24.418 --> 11:28.687
I know what you are trying
to do, Sherry, and it's not nice.

11:30.990 --> 11:34.025
Look, Markus.

11:34.027 --> 11:39.364
Nothing will ever happen.
I want you to leave now.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.933
You're nothing but a lap dog.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.203
You're my
ex-husband's footstool.

11:45.205 --> 11:49.741
You try everything you can to try
and get out from his shadows,

11:49.743 --> 11:52.077
but you never will.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.748
You're pathetic.

12:23.943 --> 12:28.012
Computer, go back to the battle.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.850
Damn. What I miss?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.154
Sup.

13:24.870 --> 13:28.373
Now, who is this?

13:40.286 --> 13:43.822
I have a lead on the two
heroes from the crime scene.

13:43.824 --> 13:49.027
Apparently, they have been
posting videos online

13:49.029 --> 13:51.763
to recruit others.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.101
I don't give a damn.

13:59.238 --> 14:02.273
It's not worth fighting him.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.910
You think I fear death?

14:06.779 --> 14:09.981
There are far worse things
than death.

14:11.984 --> 14:14.285
Tell him to bring it on.

14:20.359 --> 14:24.662
Look at you,
all fueled with rage.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.599
Do you find something amusing
about your own death?

14:27.601 --> 14:29.767
You're quite mistaken
about that.

14:38.445 --> 14:39.711
Look at you.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.753
So much power
hides in those veins.

14:48.755 --> 14:54.959
You are a cascading vortex
of pure hatred, and now...

14:54.961 --> 14:58.096
a puppet for my amusement.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.965
How's it finally feel
being the weaker of the two?

15:00.967 --> 15:03.434
Feast your eyes one last time.

15:03.436 --> 15:07.171
Allow my image to be burned
into your mind's eye.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.677
Burn your eyes out.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.825
He wants you to self-destruct.

15:27.827 --> 15:32.597
Play his little game,
wait for the perfect moment...

15:32.599 --> 15:35.166
and then get your vengeance.

15:36.235 --> 15:42.507
I'll go.
You... dispose of this kid.

16:01.493 --> 16:06.397
The boy from
earlier, how did he get there?

17:16.068 --> 17:17.969
Willie.

17:22.741 --> 17:24.642
That was a good job.

17:25.377 --> 17:27.278
Alright,
we got a few recyclables.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.180
Yes, and we took out a bad guy.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.915
Oh. Was he bad?

17:30.917 --> 17:34.452
Let us get him some coal
and put it in his stocking.

17:34.454 --> 17:36.220
We don't have a stocking
to give it in.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.955
He does not have a stocking?

17:37.957 --> 17:41.692
- That's not a problem. We can get one.
- Alright! Yes.

17:41.694 --> 17:46.964
Okay, um... that way!
Let's go! Woohoo!

17:52.137 --> 17:57.875
They just left by jumping
up the side of the building.

18:05.884 --> 18:07.485
Thanks.

18:16.328 --> 18:20.932
Is it better to live a monster
or die a hero?

18:25.504 --> 18:28.506
In this question
there's only two choices.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.079
But are there only two?

18:38.851 --> 18:41.986
I like to believe
there's a third in between.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.824
To exist.

18:49.661 --> 18:53.397
Not good, not bad.

18:55.033 --> 18:57.568
Not martyr, not sinner.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.974
To just live.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.043
Be normal.

19:11.283 --> 19:12.950
I choose normality.

19:14.186 --> 19:17.855
I choose to step from the polar
ends and meet in the middle.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.762
But I can't choose that.

19:26.732 --> 19:28.766
So, I choose death.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.606
Can't have that either,
thanks to this curse.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.183
So...

19:46.752 --> 19:48.553
I Grant you mercy,

19:48.555 --> 19:52.089
by removing you
from a world worth leaving.

19:56.829 --> 19:58.429
Enjoy it.

20:00.332 --> 20:02.533
Return to the fight.

20:06.071 --> 20:08.873
Feeling around your house.

20:10.943 --> 20:13.277
It's a whole new world.

20:15.247 --> 20:19.217
Same as vengeance.
When something like vengeance...

20:19.219 --> 20:22.453
Who might this be?

20:22.455 --> 20:26.924
I won't kill you, to get to her.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.594
What is so special about her?

20:57.222 --> 20:59.323
Is he in there?

21:13.171 --> 21:14.572
Is this the place?

21:14.574 --> 21:20.011
Yes, that's the Ir room.
Instant rehabilitation.

21:34.359 --> 21:36.294
We need to talk.

21:39.331 --> 21:45.102
Is this some kind
of casual encounter?

21:45.104 --> 21:47.004
Don't flatter yourself.

21:47.006 --> 21:49.874
I'm here to get back
what you've stolen.

21:49.876 --> 21:52.143
Where's the hard drive, Max?

22:07.459 --> 22:12.430
Odd, you know my name,

22:12.432 --> 22:15.199
but I don't seem to know yours.

22:28.980 --> 22:34.785
I, uh... I saw a hero today.

22:34.787 --> 22:39.523
A little boy, no more
than five years old.

22:39.525 --> 22:45.162
He uh, stood up for another boy
at the bus stop.

22:46.331 --> 22:48.699
It was...

22:50.035 --> 22:54.338
It was... one step closer.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.915
The air is different here.

23:06.752 --> 23:14.091
I don't know if it's peace
or Serenity of death.

23:16.928 --> 23:19.697
You're out of the darkness now.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.734
It's only in their eyes.

23:24.736 --> 23:29.373
People don't
love each other anymore...

23:29.375 --> 23:31.575
They just fight.

23:37.015 --> 23:42.153
I love you, Alan.
I love you.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.398
Can I help you?

23:54.400 --> 23:57.368
I came to pay my respects.

23:57.370 --> 24:03.774
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did you know him well?

24:05.777 --> 24:08.078
Not long.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.948
Actually I didn't help him
at all.

24:11.850 --> 24:15.586
I was somebody else.
It was another life.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.087
I see.

24:17.089 --> 24:20.624
I'm Jerry, his brother.
- Christy.

24:21.726 --> 24:26.931
Your brother... he had a gift.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.334
Do you?

24:31.136 --> 24:34.071
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to be nosey.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.073
I know it's personal.

24:36.075 --> 24:41.345
It's fine.
Yeah... I do.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.117
Do you think you can help me?

24:49.020 --> 24:54.058
You didn't come for Alan...
Did you?

25:01.433 --> 25:05.970
- I need help.
- What's wrong?

25:05.972 --> 25:09.640
I was an accessory
to stealing a hard drive

25:09.642 --> 25:15.446
containing detailed information
about people's lives in the city.

25:15.448 --> 25:18.983
- What do you need me for?
- That's just it.

25:18.985 --> 25:23.187
The person who knows
got incarcerated.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.890
I'm not gonna be breaking
someone out of prison.

25:25.892 --> 25:28.692
No, it's not like that.

25:28.694 --> 25:34.131
We break in, yes,
we get the information...

25:34.133 --> 25:36.400
then we leave.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.868
Where is he?

25:39.071 --> 25:43.007
Nor will you.
Now where's the hard drive?

25:45.911 --> 25:49.313
Wearing your
big boy pants today.

25:50.148 --> 25:53.984
What puts you in control?

25:53.986 --> 25:57.021
My purpose puts me in control.

25:58.123 --> 26:01.792
And all the people in this city
that you spit on,

26:01.794 --> 26:04.562
I'm here to protect them.

26:06.898 --> 26:08.632
Spit.

26:11.169 --> 26:15.472
Well, hero of this city,

26:15.474 --> 26:19.577
come take a ride with me.

26:19.579 --> 26:24.415
Is this all you can do?

26:24.417 --> 26:28.385
Is this all you got?
Come on, make it hurt!

27:03.755 --> 27:07.091
Tell me about this man.

27:10.228 --> 27:12.429
It wasn't long
after the meteor hit

27:12.431 --> 27:14.665
that I had my first
encounter with death.

27:14.667 --> 27:19.036
The red rain phenomena came a
mutation, started to infect people.

27:19.038 --> 27:20.804
Most were immune to it,

27:20.806 --> 27:23.440
but those
with increased exposure

27:23.442 --> 27:25.175
were given a curse.

27:25.177 --> 27:28.879
With that curse came the main
catalyst to the wars.

27:28.881 --> 27:31.782
Some called it
the future of mankind.

27:31.784 --> 27:34.652
The rest called it
an abomination.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.955
They lost their lives.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.083
Stupid!

28:07.218 --> 28:09.953
The infected started to
drastically decline in numbers

28:09.955 --> 28:12.723
until one day, all the rest
just went into hiding.

28:12.725 --> 28:17.261
Years went by a series of reform
and rebuild.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.063
Everything became
structured again.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.865
Except now, we have a hotline
to call

28:21.867 --> 28:24.001
in case someone uses powers.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.739
I know you're there.

28:33.211 --> 28:35.245
I didn't mean to alarm you.

28:39.484 --> 28:41.518
What are you doing?

28:41.520 --> 28:44.755
I... we need your help.

28:44.757 --> 28:49.159
- Aw, come on!
- No, seriously.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.795
Okay, yeah, we did try
to attack you back there,

28:51.797 --> 28:54.164
but that's because we thought
you were one of them.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.834
Okay, who are you
and who's them?

28:56.836 --> 29:00.838
I'm Skye and I'm with a rebel group
called entropy. It's a group that...

29:00.840 --> 29:02.473
Yeah, yeah.
I watch the news.

29:02.475 --> 29:05.476
It's not who we are. We're
trying to make a difference.

29:05.478 --> 29:08.345
By killing innocent people? That's
how you're making a difference?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.447
And what were you
trying to do earlier?

29:13.351 --> 29:17.721
I can Grant you a
gift, and I can't take it away.

29:17.723 --> 29:19.089
It's simple.

29:19.091 --> 29:23.293
Would you like
all your greatest desires...

29:23.295 --> 29:25.162
to come true?

29:25.730 --> 29:27.531
Take a life.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.701
It will all be given to you.

30:01.633 --> 30:03.801
What are you looking for?

30:05.470 --> 30:07.771
Do you see something you like?

30:11.309 --> 30:12.743
Anyway, that's not us.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.678
That's someone else
doing those attacks.

30:14.680 --> 30:16.580
We're a non-violent group.

30:16.582 --> 30:20.517
We're trying to un-brainwash people
and bring them out of the darkness.

30:20.519 --> 30:22.553
So, who did you think I was?

30:23.988 --> 30:27.357
Well, one of the shadows.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.028
They're everywhere
but you can never see them.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.397
Well, you made a mistake.
I can't help you.

30:33.399 --> 30:36.099
Yes, you can.
We are only five strong!

30:36.101 --> 30:39.069
No, what you need to do is stop
playing Batman and go home!

30:39.071 --> 30:41.071
People die.
This is not a comic book.

30:41.073 --> 30:42.739
There are no happy endings.

30:42.741 --> 30:45.242
You live, there's a lot of
misery, and then you die.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.612
Once you understand that,
you'll know it's not worth it.

30:49.848 --> 30:51.682
We don't all
have to be miserable.

30:51.684 --> 30:55.786
If you can save one person from a
miserable life, isn't that worth ours?

31:01.759 --> 31:04.595
Spoken like a true hero.

31:10.668 --> 31:14.504
And what else might I have done?

31:14.506 --> 31:18.108
I only hid my actions
under the law of the city.

31:41.099 --> 31:45.235
When does this girl come in?

31:47.672 --> 31:51.975
I won't kill you to get to her.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.417
Dear dad,

32:00.419 --> 32:04.721
I know you always wanted a certain
degree of success from me.

32:04.723 --> 32:08.959
And you've gotten it,
until you read this note.

32:08.961 --> 32:11.528
I can't live anymore
in your shadow.

32:11.530 --> 32:15.999
I know you started out nothing
and built so much.

32:16.001 --> 32:20.304
I'm not you. I can't be hidden
from the world any longer.

32:20.306 --> 32:23.073
I need to see this world
for myself.

32:23.075 --> 32:27.177
I need to experience failure,
heartbreak, and love.

32:27.179 --> 32:30.881
All these emotions that you
have steered me clear of.

32:30.883 --> 32:34.685
I know you love me.
I love you too.

32:34.687 --> 32:38.255
But I just need this time
to figure out who I am.

32:38.257 --> 32:40.924
And who I want to be
in this world.

32:40.926 --> 32:43.193
I love you, dad.
Lauren.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.663
- Egotan!
- And Cybersting's...

32:46.665 --> 32:49.833
- Mini book!
- Of justices.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.068
- Justice...
- No.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.070
Justice!

32:53.571 --> 32:57.841
Lauren found herself caught up with the
wrong people and in the wrong place.

32:57.843 --> 33:00.110
I am so caught up.

33:01.079 --> 33:03.246
Lauren had nothing
to call out for,

33:03.248 --> 33:06.116
neither hope nor prayer.
She was lost.

33:06.118 --> 33:08.585
Oh, I am so lost!

33:08.587 --> 33:12.356
Sticky and twitch are the
two that are... Have Lauren captive.

33:12.358 --> 33:13.857
This is sticky.

33:13.859 --> 33:16.526
I'm sticky, I'm bad.

33:17.628 --> 33:18.962
This is twitch.

33:18.964 --> 33:20.731
Because of
their unclean hotel room

33:20.733 --> 33:22.966
they had a visit
they will never forget.

33:22.968 --> 33:25.102
Oh, it's so unclean.

33:25.104 --> 33:26.302
Oh, that's me.

33:26.304 --> 33:28.972
Egotan and Cybersting
were out collecting garbage

33:28.974 --> 33:30.407
for recycling purposes.

33:30.409 --> 33:31.975
I'm collecting.

33:33.177 --> 33:36.046
The hostility grew
as they refused to recycle.

33:36.048 --> 33:38.281
That ended up
being a big mistake.

33:38.283 --> 33:39.616
Horn of justice.

33:40.551 --> 33:42.419
Cybersting came in, happy to see

33:42.421 --> 33:46.289
that he needs to teach
the importance of recycling.

33:46.291 --> 33:48.458
Lesson one.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.560
With both crooks taken down,

33:50.562 --> 33:53.330
the two decide to start
their recycling endeavor.

33:53.332 --> 33:55.899
There's so much trash.

33:55.901 --> 33:57.300
In the bathroom,

33:57.302 --> 34:00.737
Cybersting finds a weak, beaten-down
girl and he decides to help.

34:00.739 --> 34:02.839
Oh, she's so beat.

34:03.808 --> 34:06.143
Cybersting is not happy.

34:06.145 --> 34:11.248
Look at his angry face!
So not happy.

34:24.661 --> 34:27.931
What is it about these two?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.802
Our ride will be
around here somewhere.

34:36.706 --> 34:39.208
Oh, over here.

34:40.344 --> 34:44.481
It is far too dangerous for you,
Beaver, so you stay back.

34:44.483 --> 34:45.815
There is a massive puddle.

34:45.818 --> 34:48.652
And you are right.
Away!

35:01.466 --> 35:03.967
These are my streets.

35:03.969 --> 35:06.903
I walk as a shadow.

35:06.905 --> 35:11.274
Surveying the land
for any evil that might stir.

35:18.616 --> 35:23.286
I am the uncle chef
fist of justice.

35:23.288 --> 35:27.858
The unbridled bond
between circumstance and reason.

35:35.133 --> 35:40.337
I am here, I am now.
I am Benever Beaver.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.640
Benever Beaver.
Is this a joke?

35:43.642 --> 35:46.543
Enough.
Continue with the fight.

36:00.057 --> 36:02.392
And this one?

36:23.649 --> 36:27.918
There-there are people
in this world...

36:27.920 --> 36:30.253
you can't trust.

36:30.255 --> 36:35.425
People who stand beside you
for years...

36:35.427 --> 36:39.596
and then turn their backs.

36:41.999 --> 36:44.801
Et tu, brute?

36:56.981 --> 37:02.652
Don't worry
about looking for anyone.

37:02.654 --> 37:05.155
That's not your job.

37:06.490 --> 37:10.594
It was mine that was taken,

37:10.596 --> 37:15.232
and I shall handle this.

37:16.167 --> 37:21.171
You... you just
watch things for me...

37:21.173 --> 37:23.273
while I'm gone.

37:23.275 --> 37:26.910
And make sure they go smoothly.

37:27.878 --> 37:29.913
I...

37:31.282 --> 37:36.519
I have a few heads to collect.

37:45.963 --> 37:49.199
Looks like it's
the senator's daughter.

38:25.436 --> 38:30.206
You got three minutes,
starting one minute ago.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.108
Make it quick.

38:33.844 --> 38:37.847
Your daughter
was murdered yesterday.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.084
Oh...

38:41.086 --> 38:44.354
Just oh?

38:44.356 --> 38:47.023
What do you want me to say?

38:48.726 --> 38:51.394
That I feel bad?

38:51.396 --> 38:53.563
That it shouldn't
have happened to her?

38:53.565 --> 38:57.233
That she was a good person?
No.

38:58.602 --> 39:01.338
I warned her that if
she hung around with criminals,

39:01.340 --> 39:05.875
she'd either die
or end up a criminal herself.

39:05.877 --> 39:10.513
Our lack of caring
about your daughter dying

39:10.515 --> 39:13.616
is a bit of a red flag for me.

39:13.618 --> 39:18.088
Maybe you pulled the trigger,
you heartless son of a bitch.

39:20.157 --> 39:25.328
Excuse me. I might be
a heartless son of a bitch,

39:25.330 --> 39:28.365
but I'm not the murdering kind.

39:28.367 --> 39:31.568
I get someone else
to do it for me.

39:37.007 --> 39:40.276
Do you know of anyone
she may have hung out with

39:40.278 --> 39:45.014
that might be considered
criminals in your vocabulary?

39:45.016 --> 39:47.851
Yeah, those little pricks

39:47.853 --> 39:50.720
that hang out
down at the water hole.

39:52.690 --> 39:54.891
Water hole?

39:56.861 --> 40:00.296
Yeah, where those people go
to drown themselves.

40:00.298 --> 40:02.665
Don't you read the newspapers?

40:02.667 --> 40:05.902
Computer, get to the point.

40:14.011 --> 40:15.979
So, what'd he say?

40:15.981 --> 40:20.750
Nothing of importance.
He said he was busy.

40:20.752 --> 40:23.720
Busy? Damnit!

40:23.722 --> 40:25.555
Max!

40:39.470 --> 40:41.271
What the hell is all this?

40:43.808 --> 40:45.809
A map!

40:46.577 --> 40:48.411
Hello?

40:49.880 --> 40:52.282
Bitch blew my arm off!

41:02.693 --> 41:05.161
We must unlock her.

41:05.163 --> 41:07.197
What the hell are we doing here?

41:07.199 --> 41:11.100
Must tap into a hard drive.

41:11.102 --> 41:14.637
So, a regular hard drive?
Seriously?

41:14.639 --> 41:17.140
I know who would know.

41:18.375 --> 41:20.910
I think it would depend
on if they were encrypted

41:20.912 --> 41:25.548
or the files were just hidden,
maybe minutes.

41:25.550 --> 41:28.084
What if it's in someone's brain?

41:29.086 --> 41:32.689
What?
You mean like hacking the mind?

41:32.691 --> 41:37.660
Didn't take long
for you to return.

41:37.662 --> 41:41.598
What, five years?

41:41.600 --> 41:47.504
Uh, again it would depend
on how it was put in there.

41:47.506 --> 41:53.610
What might entertain you
this day?

41:53.612 --> 41:57.514
What says I didn't come to chat?

41:57.516 --> 42:00.316
Well, we don't know how,
but is it possible?

42:00.318 --> 42:04.821
I'm building myself
a robotic arm, so, yes.

42:04.823 --> 42:06.823
Yes, it's possible.

42:06.825 --> 42:11.728
Or get all lathered up
in conversation...

42:11.730 --> 42:14.264
with an old friend.

42:14.266 --> 42:17.500
Right there, that's why...

42:17.502 --> 42:21.104
we've never been friends.

42:22.006 --> 42:28.711
So, how is the old
watering hole, lately?

42:28.713 --> 42:32.782
Not very many suicides here.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.486
Not a one.

42:38.422 --> 42:41.658
Who's here with you?

42:42.760 --> 42:46.663
A traitor and a little girl.

42:46.665 --> 42:49.799
You decide who's who.

43:03.147 --> 43:06.716
We've come
to find the hard drive.

43:06.718 --> 43:09.085
The girl...

43:11.589 --> 43:14.457
and the traitor.

43:17.394 --> 43:20.129
We were led to believe you knew
where to find the hard drive.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.566
You were led... right.

43:24.468 --> 43:28.438
But I can only tell
one person at a time

43:28.440 --> 43:30.373
where this hard drive is.

43:30.375 --> 43:33.743
Then two of us... will leave.

43:33.745 --> 43:36.613
That won't be working either.

43:36.615 --> 43:39.515
You see, as of right now...

43:39.517 --> 43:43.653
there are more
than just the four of us here.

43:43.655 --> 43:46.522
They came before you.

43:49.260 --> 43:51.594
What the hell just happened?

43:51.596 --> 43:56.099
So, Ress told me
some of the details,

43:56.101 --> 44:00.770
but please tell me
about this hard drive.

44:00.772 --> 44:04.440
And who do you wish to kill...
With it?

44:09.314 --> 44:13.850
Who are you?
What am-what am I doing here?

44:13.852 --> 44:18.087
- We brought you tea.
- Damsels always drink tea.

44:18.089 --> 44:19.455
Always.

44:19.857 --> 44:21.524
Tea?

44:21.526 --> 44:27.063
So, what information
does this device hold?

44:27.065 --> 44:31.534
It started to retrieve
information about the world.

44:31.536 --> 44:33.369
Like what?

44:34.004 --> 44:36.372
Life...

44:36.374 --> 44:40.076
Any and all information
in the future.

44:40.078 --> 44:47.216
So, this knows
passwords, people, locations.

44:47.218 --> 44:49.118
Everything.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.887
So, where is it?

44:50.889 --> 44:54.123
Here, I made this for you.
When I was making fliers

44:54.125 --> 44:56.659
so we could apprehend
our last criminal.

44:56.661 --> 44:58.061
Don't worry!

44:58.063 --> 45:02.598
See, our last fliers got evil
toxin caught and off the streets.

45:02.600 --> 45:06.502
- Whoa, are you not impressed?
- Mmh.

45:06.504 --> 45:08.971
So, you don't catch crooks?

45:08.973 --> 45:12.341
Don't litter. Don't pull the
tags off the mattresses!

45:12.343 --> 45:13.609
The list is endless.

45:13.611 --> 45:15.011
Endless.

45:15.013 --> 45:21.317
She's... an implant.
A tracking... device.

45:21.319 --> 45:22.785
Do you have sugar?

45:27.692 --> 45:30.893
Alright. I think we
have come to the conclusion

45:30.895 --> 45:34.931
that there is no sugar
in this room!

45:40.105 --> 45:44.607
Seriously, don't!
Stop pulling this.

45:48.479 --> 45:52.648
Ah ha!
Crime smells a foot.

45:52.650 --> 45:56.319
We must find a perch for crime.

45:56.321 --> 45:57.987
Crime smells.

45:57.989 --> 46:01.557
Yes, it...
Oh wait! Cookies!

46:01.559 --> 46:03.626
Where could they be?

46:03.628 --> 46:04.961
Oh, I found a bench!

46:04.963 --> 46:11.067
Ah ha, you are right!
It is absolutely perfect!

46:21.578 --> 46:24.046
They ditched me again.

46:24.048 --> 46:28.985
I'm a super hero, too.
I got powers.

46:28.987 --> 46:31.420
I need my own horn of justice.

46:32.289 --> 46:34.690
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

46:35.259 --> 46:38.294
- Hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

46:38.296 --> 46:40.062
Hmm.

46:40.597 --> 46:42.932
Oh, we point.

46:42.934 --> 46:45.868
Of course!
What about over there?

46:45.870 --> 46:47.868
Now, something with
that amount of power

46:47.870 --> 46:51.374
is going to be setting off a pretty steady
set of electromagnetic frequencies.

46:59.183 --> 47:03.019
These are good Benever
Beaver cookies. Here, take some.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.587
Thank you.

47:10.294 --> 47:11.828
Perfect.

47:11.830 --> 47:14.730
See through these you should be
able to spot it from a mile away.

47:14.732 --> 47:17.133
Might be blinding actually.

47:22.005 --> 47:23.739
If you're looking for a needle
in a haystack,

47:23.741 --> 47:24.974
those right there
are your magnet.

47:24.976 --> 47:26.474
I'm going alone.

47:26.476 --> 47:28.177
Whoa, there are a lot of people
out there looking for her.

47:28.179 --> 47:29.512
I'm going alone.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.948
It's too dangerous to go alone.

47:31.950 --> 47:36.185
Hey, you two, seriously,
why do I have to wear this?

47:36.187 --> 47:40.022
Hmm.
That is a safety harness.

47:40.024 --> 47:43.593
It is to make sure you
are never stolen for evil again.

47:43.595 --> 47:45.595
Want a cookie?

47:46.997 --> 47:50.199
Cybersting needs a cape.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.468
Down the road.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.170
Cybersting, you need a cape.

47:54.172 --> 47:55.771
I need no cape.

47:55.773 --> 47:59.308
Yes, you do.
That's what we are missing.

47:59.310 --> 48:02.211
So, the tank found her.

48:02.213 --> 48:07.516
He must know he could use her
to find who killed his family.

48:07.518 --> 48:09.485
I have pants.

48:09.487 --> 48:10.987
I see those pants.

48:10.989 --> 48:13.489
- You have pants.
- I have pants!

48:13.491 --> 48:14.857
No way!

48:17.295 --> 48:19.262
The trembling in my pants!

48:19.264 --> 48:21.597
- Pants! Pants!
- Pants!

48:21.599 --> 48:23.733
- Pants! Pants!
- Pants! Pants!

48:23.735 --> 48:25.701
- Pants! Pants!
- Pants! Pants!

48:25.703 --> 48:26.936
Well?

48:26.938 --> 48:28.537
- Pants? Pants!
- Pants!

48:28.539 --> 48:30.339
- I've got pants.
- I've got pants.

48:36.314 --> 48:37.513
Pants!

48:41.753 --> 48:43.686
I'm a peacock!

48:43.688 --> 48:46.789
Oh, where did everybody go?

48:53.697 --> 48:59.902
The safest you'll ever
be is right by my side.

49:07.778 --> 49:10.513
You left her tea.

49:53.156 --> 49:55.191
Whoa. Freaky.

51:51.508 --> 51:53.843
There's a little girl
out there...

51:53.845 --> 51:55.945
running for her life...

51:58.648 --> 52:02.218
and we want to chase her
down for our own selfishness.

52:02.220 --> 52:04.854
Metus killed my sister...

52:05.822 --> 52:07.690
but his power...

52:07.692 --> 52:13.262
Interesting. Max,
the only one not in the fight

52:13.264 --> 52:16.465
threw her out the window...

52:16.467 --> 52:20.336
and then saved by these two.

52:23.240 --> 52:27.176
His powers are not derived
from him.

52:28.678 --> 52:33.215
It's from us. We have to
take that control away.

52:48.865 --> 52:51.233
No, you cannot just keep
piling people into my house.

52:51.235 --> 52:52.735
It will be fine

52:52.737 --> 52:54.803
Go quickly over here.
Hide over there.

52:54.805 --> 52:56.972
- Nope no, no hiding.
- Like this.

53:27.971 --> 53:30.105
I've had enough of this world.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.653
I deserve this.

53:48.826 --> 53:50.426
They bring the girl away

53:50.428 --> 53:53.596
where they are attacked
once again.

54:37.407 --> 54:39.575
And maze grows a weakness...

54:39.577 --> 54:40.776
a heart...

54:40.778 --> 54:42.678
taking their lives.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.913
So where's the rodent?

54:47.317 --> 54:49.551
Oh, why?

54:50.587 --> 54:52.388
Gah!

54:53.623 --> 54:55.391
I don't know.

54:55.393 --> 54:57.426
It just feels right.

54:59.496 --> 55:02.031
Why are there so many lights?

55:04.601 --> 55:06.935
It just adds to the mood.

55:09.639 --> 55:11.340
Kill him.

55:13.710 --> 55:16.578
Christy, you never said
anything about killing anyone.

55:17.847 --> 55:20.316
What do you think would happen

55:20.318 --> 55:22.484
if someone other than us

55:22.486 --> 55:25.487
got their hands
on what's inside of her?

55:25.489 --> 55:29.625
I understand, but it's ending
lives, not saving them.

55:31.061 --> 55:35.297
Says who?
Continue. This is fun.

55:37.834 --> 55:43.939
What do you see happening?
After all this?

55:43.941 --> 55:45.674
I don't know.

55:45.676 --> 55:46.676
Don't do it.

55:49.746 --> 55:51.280
I-I cant.

55:51.282 --> 55:52.881
Yes, you can.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.974
What an odd twist.

56:22.245 --> 56:26.915
Oh... lets see...

56:26.917 --> 56:30.652
You have a gun and I have...

56:32.622 --> 56:33.789
nothing.

56:33.791 --> 56:38.827
So, lets see. You want another body.
Is that it?

56:38.829 --> 56:40.529
I'm not afraid.

56:41.264 --> 56:42.765
Do it.

56:47.470 --> 56:50.839
She always likes
making a presence.

56:59.048 --> 57:00.983
Max.

57:02.385 --> 57:03.652
Crypt.

57:07.724 --> 57:09.258
It's been a while.

57:09.260 --> 57:12.861
You're quite late on your dues.

57:12.863 --> 57:16.432
When can I
start seeing some payment?

57:16.434 --> 57:17.666
Well

57:17.668 --> 57:19.268
I...

57:21.704 --> 57:25.908
Well I... brought you one
right here.

57:25.910 --> 57:27.810
Sometimes...

57:27.812 --> 57:30.913
I have this dream...

57:30.915 --> 57:32.748
where I'm in the dark...

57:32.750 --> 57:34.716
alone...

57:34.718 --> 57:36.752
dying...

57:36.754 --> 57:39.288
I keep telling myself...

57:39.290 --> 57:43.525
that this is only a dream...

57:43.527 --> 57:45.661
What if it's not?

57:47.464 --> 57:49.298
Since then...

57:49.300 --> 57:52.034
I've always
been afraid of the dark.

57:55.839 --> 57:58.774
Stop it!
Where are we going?

57:59.709 --> 58:02.110
Shut up and follow me.

58:03.179 --> 58:05.013
You think you're the only one?

58:05.015 --> 58:06.715
I missed lunch...

58:06.717 --> 58:08.550
and nap time...

58:08.552 --> 58:10.052
and second lunch.

58:11.788 --> 58:14.656
Every time I go with you
I see people being impaled.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.426
I think I have it
a little bit worse.

58:19.095 --> 58:20.329
Please.

58:22.665 --> 58:24.032
Lets go.

58:24.667 --> 58:26.535
Four dead,

58:26.537 --> 58:28.570
two cowards ran off,

58:28.572 --> 58:31.306
the idiots must be dead,

58:31.308 --> 58:32.808
and a few...

58:32.810 --> 58:34.209
remain.

58:39.549 --> 58:42.451
Watch out for the rubble.
I just got it the way I like it.

58:43.653 --> 58:47.656
This place is a disaster.
It's disgusting.

58:51.761 --> 58:54.029
Is it...

58:54.031 --> 58:56.298
darkness...

58:56.300 --> 58:58.700
that drives you?

59:00.169 --> 59:03.539
They tried to kill you...

59:03.541 --> 59:07.976
but you continue to walk...

59:07.978 --> 59:09.978
stand...

59:09.980 --> 59:11.046
fight...

59:11.048 --> 59:12.748
Crawl...

59:12.750 --> 59:14.449
and hide...

59:16.252 --> 59:18.520
I'm sorry.
I'm not good at poetry.

59:18.522 --> 59:21.590
What is this?

59:23.626 --> 59:25.661
I'm here to help you.

59:25.663 --> 59:27.029
Right here.

59:34.070 --> 59:35.337
Hmm..

59:35.339 --> 59:36.905
Not so fast.

59:37.974 --> 59:41.810
Well Roy,
it's that damn Beaver again.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.545
Benever.

59:44.347 --> 59:47.015
Oh, not him again.

59:47.017 --> 59:50.152
We keep telling you
not to come around these parts.

59:50.154 --> 59:51.954
You're able to be shot.

59:51.956 --> 59:55.023
Yeah, uh,
this is our secret hide out.

59:55.025 --> 59:57.059
I'm going into that cave.

59:57.061 --> 01:00:00.596
Your going to get a super
secret bullet up your ass.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.933
I'm sorry, guys.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:08.136
I'm sorry for whatever Benever
might have done.

01:00:08.138 --> 01:00:10.839
We just really
need somewhere to stay.

01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.941
These people are after us.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:14.910
I'm...

01:00:16.412 --> 01:00:18.680
I just need somewhere to stay
for the night.

01:00:18.682 --> 01:00:20.182
I'm sorry.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:22.284
There's nothing down there.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:24.953
So might you two walk away.

01:00:24.955 --> 01:00:27.255
Put some haste in your feet

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:32.160
before Roy and I bet who can take
the most bullets to the head

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:34.363
before they hit the ground.

01:00:35.231 --> 01:00:37.132
I'm not going nowhere.

01:00:39.202 --> 01:00:40.836
No, no!

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:44.039
Look at what you did.

01:00:45.875 --> 01:00:47.843
I don't think they liked you.

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.613
And the plot thickens.

01:00:52.615 --> 01:00:54.116
This guy again.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:00:59.988
Please don't hurt him.

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:04.159
He's already drawn his sword
and cast the first blow.

01:01:05.628 --> 01:01:07.295
I'm sorry. What?

01:01:07.797 --> 01:01:09.331
I wasn't listening.

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:15.303
Just to warn you,
my blood will stain.

01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.547
Oh, we found some
recyclables down by the mill.

01:01:26.783 --> 01:01:28.884
Fee fi Fo fum!

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:31.820
You came lead her to tea again?

01:01:31.822 --> 01:01:35.123
Do you even know
why anyone is after her?

01:01:36.159 --> 01:01:39.561
Well you see,
she needed our help

01:01:39.563 --> 01:01:42.798
and that is all
that is important.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.766
Ah, yes.

01:01:56.746 --> 01:01:57.946
Cowabunga!

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.017
Uh-oh.

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.268
I'm not good.

01:02:37.186 --> 01:02:39.354
My turn!

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:47.863
You missed me.

01:02:48.798 --> 01:02:50.232
Slap.

01:03:01.410 --> 01:03:03.145
Egotan!

01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:07.215
Chimichanga!

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:15.223
Come on you big oaf, get up.

01:03:15.225 --> 01:03:16.358
I'm fine.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.793
Do it your damn self.

01:03:17.795 --> 01:03:21.797
I'm fine.

01:03:25.001 --> 01:03:26.334
Come on.

01:03:49.358 --> 01:03:52.227
- Wait here.
- No, I'm coming with you.

01:03:52.229 --> 01:03:53.662
Ow!

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:05.707
Eat my cookies.

01:04:47.049 --> 01:04:49.251
This means nothing.

01:04:52.822 --> 01:04:55.390
Through the cave,
that's the way out the back.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:10.305
The rodent flees,
and now, enter Max.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:12.240
The plan was simple.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.442
Take a hard drive...

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:17.178
that was endowed with...

01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.514
special powers...

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:20.949
of absorbing...

01:05:20.951 --> 01:05:23.318
all the information...

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.420
of the Internet...

01:05:25.422 --> 01:05:28.023
place this hard drive...

01:05:28.025 --> 01:05:29.691
in a child...

01:05:29.693 --> 01:05:32.560
deep, deep into the mind...

01:05:32.562 --> 01:05:34.396
There, no one...

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:36.865
will be able to find it.

01:05:36.867 --> 01:05:39.034
The idea was sound...

01:05:39.036 --> 01:05:41.169
easy...

01:05:41.171 --> 01:05:43.004
..For a time...

01:05:43.006 --> 01:05:46.174
until long passed...

01:05:46.176 --> 01:05:48.343
that child...

01:05:48.345 --> 01:05:50.211
becomes lost...

01:05:50.213 --> 01:05:52.280
lost to me...

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.249
but it's found...

01:05:54.251 --> 01:05:56.518
was found...

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.720
my hard drive...

01:05:58.722 --> 01:06:00.989
All I had to do...

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:03.458
was retrieve it.

01:07:44.327 --> 01:07:49.030
The city,
how did it get destroyed?

01:08:04.914 --> 01:08:10.385
A dying wish granted
to the already deceased.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:16.390
Her sacrifice
is just the catalyst.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:24.999
And you justify death
with her death?

01:08:28.170 --> 01:08:31.805
I justify life with her death.

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:36.711
I justify the well being
of everyone in this city...

01:08:36.712 --> 01:08:38.379
with her sacrifice

01:08:38.381 --> 01:08:41.149
you are a tyrant

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.419
with a whistle
around every person's neck

01:08:44.421 --> 01:08:47.622
ready to cry wolf
at the slightest beat.

01:08:48.591 --> 01:08:51.225
How goes the witch hunt?

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:55.497
There is only one witch
I wish to burn.

01:08:56.799 --> 01:09:00.502
I am the cause
of your current rule.

01:09:01.337 --> 01:09:04.471
I will take
your animosity and...

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:07.575
offer you a way out of this...

01:09:07.577 --> 01:09:09.978
cat and mouse game
you're playing.

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:14.349
Would you like
to hold the knowledge...

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:18.419
of all of the city
in the palm of your hand?

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:22.991
What would it cost, witch?

01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:25.993
Very little.

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:28.729
There is a hard drive...

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:30.365
in a young girl.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:37.104
Retrieve her, and I'll Grant you
access to all of the information.

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.144
Where is she?

01:09:43.145 --> 01:09:46.247
Explains why
he made his two minions

01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:49.450
follow up on the hanged girl.

01:10:13.609 --> 01:10:15.977
I did as you asked...

01:10:15.979 --> 01:10:19.214
but Cain hasn't done
what you said he would.

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:24.118
Now he's on this little
rampage of vengeance.

01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.889
This did not go
as you said it would.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:32.994
Fear not what happened.
But fear what will be.

01:10:32.996 --> 01:10:35.797
Tell me where she is...

01:10:35.799 --> 01:10:37.165
and I'll get it for you.

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:43.571
In a cave northwest of
here, on the outskirts of town.

01:11:02.958 --> 01:11:06.995
And I thought she was
taking care of the two of you.

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:09.364
Depends on who
you're referring to.

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.234
I was sent...

01:11:14.603 --> 01:11:15.870
By me...

01:11:17.039 --> 01:11:21.576
Witch! What...
What is going on here?

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:23.344
We had a deal.

01:11:23.346 --> 01:11:25.913
I fulfilled my deal.

01:11:25.915 --> 01:11:28.950
You did not.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:31.019
This cave...

01:11:31.021 --> 01:11:33.521
and these two...

01:11:33.523 --> 01:11:36.924
protect the last remnants
of the red rain...

01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.360
for me.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.732
Then what the hell
did you need me for?

01:11:44.734 --> 01:11:45.833
To distract...

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:49.170
unleash chaos in the city...

01:11:49.172 --> 01:11:52.206
and a victim.

01:11:53.609 --> 01:12:00.248
It has been far too difficult
to get one more body down here.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.884
You think...

01:12:06.288 --> 01:12:07.755
Oops.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:13.861
So the witch
manipulated all sides.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.230
When did she destroy the city?

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:21.369
Your course has run its end.
You're through.

01:12:22.438 --> 01:12:26.974
Your reign will end... tonight!

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:49.230
And how are the two favoring?

01:13:46.255 --> 01:13:49.090
So, I think we should end this.

01:13:49.092 --> 01:13:51.893
It's time to get serious.

01:13:51.895 --> 01:13:55.530
Yes, there are many
that need help in the city.

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:58.366
Oh, you are right!

01:14:23.992 --> 01:14:25.560
Can you see me?

01:14:39.408 --> 01:14:42.043
Don't litter.

01:14:49.985 --> 01:14:51.652
Bitch.

01:14:51.654 --> 01:14:55.089
The power
of the device in her head..

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:58.059
Brings out the witch.

01:15:02.531 --> 01:15:04.365
Stop.

01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:06.801
Don't harm him.

01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:09.370
Your reign shall end.

01:15:10.339 --> 01:15:13.341
You will not get the power
you desire.

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.848
We'll see about this.

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:42.937
Where did everything go?

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:45.640
Huh?

01:17:22.604 --> 01:17:24.138
Enough!

01:18:21.096 --> 01:18:22.697
Egotan.

01:18:24.967 --> 01:18:26.867
Cybersting!

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.768
Oh, okay, lets see.

01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:05.072
Oh, alright. Lets... i guess
we'll just turn, right here.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:08.676
And, right, okay.
That looks perfect.

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:17.084
So, these two
are my adversaries.

01:19:27.964 --> 01:19:29.997
Ah! Oh! Ow!

01:19:29.999 --> 01:19:33.300
I hit my hand.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:42.409
- Egotan!
- Cybersting!

01:19:58.026 --> 01:20:00.728
When did they die?

01:20:02.697 --> 01:20:07.902
You killed them...
Four days ago.
