00:06.011 --> 00:07.720
Previously
on Billions...

00:07.804 --> 00:08.970
This place doesn't feel

00:09.053 --> 00:10.470
very much like a home to me
right now.

00:10.553 --> 00:13.011
Don't put our home
up for sale.

00:13.095 --> 00:15.679
A very interesting set of
permits just got expedited.

00:15.762 --> 00:18.595
The beneficiary?
One Charles Rhoades, Senior.

00:18.679 --> 00:21.136
Qatar State Bank is going to be
taken off the restricted list

00:21.220 --> 00:23.261
and it's ready to give you
a sweetheart of a loan.

00:23.345 --> 00:25.136
That does bring a grin.

00:25.220 --> 00:26.929
Are you
sure about this?

00:27.011 --> 00:29.303
Got it straight from
the Secretary Of The Treasury.

00:29.387 --> 00:32.302
What do Jock Jeffcoat
and his disciples have on you?

00:32.387 --> 00:34.929
Jock threatened to freeze funds,
delay funds, yank funds.

00:35.011 --> 00:36.679
Axe is coming
for you now.

00:36.762 --> 00:39.428
He said you chose
your father over your business.

00:39.512 --> 00:41.011
I'm sorry
it worked out this way.

00:41.095 --> 00:42.929
My enemies seemed
to have found a way

00:43.011 --> 00:44.929
to aim the government at us
like a nuclear weapon.

00:45.011 --> 00:46.679
Do you have any fucking idea
what you've done?

00:46.762 --> 00:48.053
Hey!

00:48.136 --> 00:50.261
Leave her alone,
you fucking goon!

00:50.345 --> 00:51.345
Fuck you, Bill!

00:51.428 --> 00:52.929
I am gonna
kick your ass!

00:53.011 --> 00:54.387
Let's do it in the ring then,
fucknut!

00:54.470 --> 00:56.804
Any time, any place,
motherfucker!

00:56.887 --> 00:58.178
You're a garbage person,
Wendy.

00:58.261 --> 01:01.261
That's what you are.
It's what you all are!

Dudley Mafee
and Dollar Bill Stearn...

01:24.387 --> 01:27.804
shall meet in this cathedral
of la dolce scienza,

01:27.887 --> 01:31.345
in a bout of pugilism
to satisfy grudges,

01:31.428 --> 01:33.345
to excite the imagination
of the sporting public

01:33.428 --> 01:34.804
and in the good name
of charity.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.178
Shall we discuss
glove weight?

01:36.261 --> 01:37.845
Let's go with 8's.
See some blood.

01:37.929 --> 01:39.428
No headgear, of course.

01:39.512 --> 01:41.136
Of course.
Gotta see the punches land.

01:41.220 --> 01:42.804
Then it's 16's,
jackass.

01:42.887 --> 01:44.387
Do you want them to
break their moneymakers?

01:44.470 --> 01:45.762
Fine. Fuck.

01:45.845 --> 01:47.136
As for the purse
and ticket sales-

01:47.220 --> 01:48.637
Sixty-forty
to the winner,

01:48.720 --> 01:50.011
allocated to the charity
of their choice.

01:50.095 --> 01:51.845
That's a gutless split,
Wagner.

01:51.929 --> 01:53.470
But then, it's gonna be
a sad day in Palookaville

01:53.553 --> 01:55.595
when your washed-up Louis
meets his Marciano.

01:55.679 --> 01:57.387
Sweetheart.

01:57.470 --> 01:59.178
I've known that traitorous dog
Mafee for many years,

01:59.261 --> 02:01.178
and I promise you,
that jaw of his

02:01.261 --> 02:03.804
is fragile as
Murano blown glass.

02:03.887 --> 02:06.553
Blown Glass, that was your
fraternity nickname wasn't it?

02:06.637 --> 02:08.637
Nope.
Algonquin Ass-Eater.

02:08.720 --> 02:10.136
75-25.

02:10.220 --> 02:11.387
Screw it.
Winner take all.

02:11.470 --> 02:12.970
Done.
Care to make a side wager?

02:13.637 --> 02:15.637
Fifty grand?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.178
Thanks, Sparky.

02:17.261 --> 02:19.970
Led Zeppelin's
"In The Evening"

02:26.136 --> 02:28.595
Wake up.

02:31.095 --> 02:32.887
The fuck
are you doing?

02:32.970 --> 02:35.095
Sneaking in here
like Versace!

02:35.178 --> 02:38.053
Versace was the victim.
Cunanan was the killer.

02:38.136 --> 02:40.929
We're here to make you
the killer!

02:41.011 --> 02:42.512
Bill,
who are these men?

02:42.595 --> 02:44.053
Nothing to fear,
miss.

02:44.136 --> 02:47.136
We're just gonna turn
your husband into a man.

02:50.387 --> 02:53.804
In the evening

02:53.887 --> 02:55.428
Lock and load.

02:55.512 --> 02:58.887
This isn't
the easy path!

02:59.011 --> 03:02.679
This is the warpath-
this is your attack on the day!

03:02.762 --> 03:04.178
I can't feel my face.

03:04.261 --> 03:06.303
The effects of
a sedentary lifestyle.

03:06.387 --> 03:07.679
Push through it.

03:07.762 --> 03:09.929
We all have
dragons to fight!

03:10.011 --> 03:11.845
When you can't
feel your face,

03:11.929 --> 03:13.303
that means you need
to go harder!

03:13.387 --> 03:15.637
Tut tut.

03:17.470 --> 03:18.679
Play you for a fool

03:18.762 --> 03:20.470
Bubbler, one-hitter,

03:20.553 --> 03:22.261
indica vape, sativa vape,

03:22.345 --> 03:25.679
gummies, tincture,
Long Bong Holmes.

03:25.762 --> 03:28.970
This one is 20-1 THC/CBD,

03:29.053 --> 03:31.428
great
for creative thinking.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.887
And you want this one...

03:32.970 --> 03:37.428
Which has a ratio of 100-1
for sleep.

03:37.512 --> 03:41.011
I'm in training now so I have to
off-load all my jazz cabbage.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.595
Use 'em in good health.

03:42.679 --> 03:45.178
And get the fuck out of here
before anyone shows up for work.

03:45.261 --> 03:47.970
Awesome, dude.
Much appreciated.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.553
Very sick.

03:52.220 --> 03:55.053
Actually-

03:55.136 --> 03:56.428
One won't hurt,
right?

03:56.512 --> 03:59.929
I mean, it might,
right?

04:00.011 --> 04:02.553
mid-tempo music

04:06.970 --> 04:08.720
Top o' the morning.

04:20.803 --> 04:23.387
You gonna get to it?

04:23.470 --> 04:26.220
Huh?
We just warmed up,

04:26.303 --> 04:28.845
ran the whole loop
and you haven't said shit.

04:28.929 --> 04:31.220
The absolute last thing I need

04:31.303 --> 04:34.011
is a jogging buddy who's less
talkative than Ghost Dog.

04:34.095 --> 04:37.136
I didn't sign up for
the coffee klatch run.

04:39.637 --> 04:41.679
You don't have a lot of
female friends, do you?

04:41.762 --> 04:45.595
Some. I just-I just...don't
keep up with them very much.

04:45.679 --> 04:48.762
Yeah.
Guy friends are easier.

04:48.845 --> 04:51.136
Once you make it clear
that you won't be smashing,

04:51.220 --> 04:53.345
they're like
herding puppies.

04:56.804 --> 04:59.929
How are you
getting out of bed?

05:02.136 --> 05:05.220
Mafee eviscerated you
in front of everyone.

05:05.303 --> 05:08.220
After you'd already been wrecked
by your husband on TV.

05:08.303 --> 05:10.011
Well, Mafee-
I actually earned that.

05:10.095 --> 05:12.762
Fuck no.
Mafee's a child.

05:12.845 --> 05:15.637
And the shit he said to you
was fucking abusive.

05:15.720 --> 05:18.178
I don't know what happened,

05:18.261 --> 05:22.345
but whatever it was,
you were protecting Axe Cap.

05:22.428 --> 05:24.970
And you held firm
as fuck.

05:25.053 --> 05:28.345
Thank you.

05:28.428 --> 05:30.345
I'm glad if
it seemed that way.

05:30.428 --> 05:34.136
But I'm not really
holding very firm.

05:34.220 --> 05:37.637
In any way.

05:37.720 --> 05:41.178
But if I try to talk it out any
more right now...I think-

05:41.261 --> 05:44.637
You'll collapse?

05:48.136 --> 05:52.428
Well we can't
have that.

05:52.512 --> 05:54.595
That's probably enough
sharing for today.

05:54.679 --> 05:56.887
C'mon.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.136
dramatic music

06:02.887 --> 06:04.303
Got you the usual.

06:04.387 --> 06:05.762
Chai for you and
a double espresso for pops.

06:05.845 --> 06:07.720
Only the chai.

06:07.804 --> 06:09.428
You no longer have to
remember the other order.

06:09.512 --> 06:11.011
In fact, I'd prefer
you stop bringing it.

06:25.762 --> 06:28.136
Ah.

06:30.178 --> 06:32.053
Thought you
might be in need of

06:32.136 --> 06:33.679
a hearty breakfast
after your run.

06:33.762 --> 06:35.428
Even got that bread
you like from She Wolf.

06:42.095 --> 06:45.512
This is all either
too soon or too late.

06:45.595 --> 06:48.470
Or maybe it's just a moment
of warmth, of connection.

06:48.553 --> 06:49.845
To show you
I appreciate-

06:49.929 --> 06:51.345
It's like the end of
Speed-The-Plow.

06:51.428 --> 06:52.887
Remember we used to
see plays together?

06:52.970 --> 06:54.970
"Would you of gone to bed with
me, I didn't do your book."

06:55.053 --> 06:58.679
I can't separate the gesture
from the situation.

06:58.762 --> 07:01.428
Uh-huh. And what is
the situation, exactly?

07:01.512 --> 07:03.261
You don't want us
to sell the house.

07:03.345 --> 07:06.136
You want me to remember
it's "home."

07:06.220 --> 07:07.679
But that couple wants to
make us an offer.

07:07.762 --> 07:11.762
And if they come in at our
number, I want us to take it.

07:11.845 --> 07:15.136
soft music

07:15.220 --> 07:17.345
It is "home."

07:17.428 --> 07:18.887
For us and the kids.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.553
It was.

07:21.637 --> 07:22.970
They want to come back
and see the place.

07:23.053 --> 07:25.178
We need to make it available
one night this week.

07:25.261 --> 07:29.261
dramatic music

07:30.553 --> 07:32.303
Live auction?

07:32.387 --> 07:34.011
Yep.
I'm now the proud owner

07:34.095 --> 07:38.553
of Lot B34750942D.
For 860.

07:38.637 --> 07:40.845
Pricey. But worth it if this
goes the way we hope...

07:40.929 --> 07:42.345
dramatic music

07:42.428 --> 07:43.887
Let's talk
fracking-

07:43.970 --> 07:45.303
Nothing to say,
since it's been banned.

07:45.387 --> 07:46.720
But refining
natural gas products

07:46.804 --> 07:48.136
that have been fracked
elsewhere

07:48.220 --> 07:49.553
is still legal
in this state.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.345
So why do you want to be
short the refiners?

07:51.428 --> 07:53.720
Over time they're a loser.

07:53.804 --> 07:55.136
This bullshit is going to
crush our position.

07:55.220 --> 07:57.512
Taylor's driving it down
on purpose. To frag us.

07:57.595 --> 07:59.220
The bill in the state
legislature right now

07:59.303 --> 08:01.428
to ban fracking-
I'm betting it passes...

08:01.512 --> 08:02.845
Fossil fuels
are a dead end.

08:02.929 --> 08:04.637
As was my time
at Axe Capital.

08:04.720 --> 08:06.428
What was
the story there?

08:06.512 --> 08:08.637
You were at one of the most
successful funds ever-

08:08.720 --> 08:10.261
The Celtics were dominant
for a long time,

08:10.345 --> 08:11.637
and then they weren't.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.595
And Bobby Axelrod
is no Larry Bird.

08:13.679 --> 08:15.220
Whoa.
So you went out on your own.

08:15.303 --> 08:17.220
-That's a big move.
-I wasn't going to stick around

08:17.303 --> 08:19.095
while that company ran itself
into the ground.

08:19.178 --> 08:21.095
I was going to launch a new
thing into the stratosphere.

08:21.178 --> 08:22.929
Wait. Wait. Wait-
are you saying

08:23.011 --> 08:25.220
that Axe Capital is driving
itself into the ground?

08:25.303 --> 08:27.095
Bobby Axelrod
was my teacher,

08:27.178 --> 08:29.720
so I have a certain amount
of nostalgic respect for him.

08:29.804 --> 08:31.970
But he's a dinosaur.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.804
So.
Like any good student,

08:33.886 --> 08:35.886
I learned what I could
from him and moved on.

08:35.970 --> 08:37.679
The smart money
will do the same.

08:37.761 --> 08:39.470
The smarter money
will do it first.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.053
Enough of this
fucking horseshit.

08:42.135 --> 08:44.470
You need to cut the head off of
this snake right fucking now.

08:44.553 --> 08:46.303
This aggression
will not stand-

08:46.387 --> 08:49.220
Okay. Personal attacks
aside, thoughts?

08:51.679 --> 08:53.428
Shit.

08:53.512 --> 08:55.428
I'll say it
since the rest of you

08:55.512 --> 08:57.970
are wimpier than
George McFly at prom:

08:58.053 --> 09:00.428
We've got to get out of
our New York refinery positions.

09:00.512 --> 09:02.637
No, Bonnie. That's just
one investor talking.

09:02.720 --> 09:04.970
We can push back.
We'll win this thing.

09:05.053 --> 09:07.970
Wags, figure out
how to use lobbyists

09:08.053 --> 09:11.303
to move the legislature through
regular political channels.

09:11.387 --> 09:15.261
Victor, figure out
how to move 'em your way.

09:21.804 --> 09:23.679
Albany's completely split
on the issue.

09:23.762 --> 09:26.595
It'll likely come down to
the governor, and he's agnostic.

09:26.679 --> 09:28.220
The Street is split too.

09:28.303 --> 09:29.595
Do you have intel?

09:29.679 --> 09:32.428
Not intel. No.
I'm confused.

09:32.512 --> 09:34.220
You're jumping into the scrum
with the score tied.

09:34.303 --> 09:35.720
Based on percentages,
we could get killed.

09:35.804 --> 09:37.637
And you just
put a target on us.

09:37.720 --> 09:40.053
This isn't just about
the refineries, is it?

09:40.136 --> 09:42.887
Correct. This is not the time to
sit back and lick our wounds.

09:42.970 --> 09:44.637
We need to go on the offensive,
dictate the action.

09:44.720 --> 09:45.887
I've never seen you
like this before.

09:45.970 --> 09:47.261
Like?

09:47.345 --> 09:49.345
Cold.
Openly vindictive.

09:49.428 --> 09:50.428
You've also never
seen them cut off

09:50.512 --> 09:52.512
their own father's
head before...

09:52.595 --> 09:54.637
Uh, shit, sorry-

09:54.720 --> 09:56.679
No. You're right.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.428
I wasn't born with
a broadsword in my hand

09:58.512 --> 10:00.845
but I was forced to learn
how to wield one, so I did.

10:00.929 --> 10:02.637
And now I'm going full
Sir Tristram de Lyones

10:02.720 --> 10:04.095
until I pierce Axe's shield

10:04.178 --> 10:06.553
and drive it into
his motherfucking heart.

10:23.887 --> 10:25.553
I do like
the war talk-

10:25.637 --> 10:27.095
I've been thinking about
how they set me up.

10:27.178 --> 10:28.679
Replaying it.
I can't believe how

10:28.762 --> 10:30.303
they targeted the strike
so precisely.

10:30.387 --> 10:31.929
That Wendy was that cold.

10:32.011 --> 10:34.387
She built a psych matrix on you
over years.

10:34.470 --> 10:36.512
That's how she knew
exactly how to hurt you.

10:36.595 --> 10:39.595
Yes. That's right.
She used everything.

10:39.679 --> 10:42.470
It will not
go unreciprocated.

10:42.553 --> 10:45.095
No.
Hang back for now.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.595
We need all our focus
on the refineries.

10:49.387 --> 10:51.095
dramatic music

10:56.053 --> 10:57.595
Axe,
I'm so sorry,

10:57.679 --> 10:59.178
I had no idea
that was gonna happen.

10:59.261 --> 11:00.679
Wh-What was I gonna do?
I couldn't stop it.

11:00.762 --> 11:02.595
Hey. It was good TV,
I'm not blaming you.

11:02.679 --> 11:04.178
But you've got to give me
equal time tomorrow.

11:04.261 --> 11:06.011
Shouldn't be a problem.

11:06.095 --> 11:08.136
One snake's head
ready to be chopped.

11:08.220 --> 11:09.720
Brief me.

11:09.804 --> 11:11.762
Head of the Board of Elections
is deciding

11:11.845 --> 11:13.387
whether to allow
blockchain technology-

11:13.470 --> 11:15.136
voting from
mobile phones.

11:15.220 --> 11:17.136
You could've delegated
this to me.

11:17.220 --> 11:19.553
Business of elections
is my bailiwick.

11:19.637 --> 11:21.428
Got a hanging chad
framed in my study.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.553
You would, Colonel Jackboot.

11:23.637 --> 11:26.220
Nothing like suppressing the
voice of the disenfranchised-

11:26.303 --> 11:29.136
No, we should let people too
lazy or stupid to even register

11:29.220 --> 11:31.595
vote from their cell phones,
so fraud runs rampant-

11:31.679 --> 11:33.011
This needs to be
punted down the road

11:33.095 --> 11:35.136
until tech and security concerns
are better vetted,

11:35.220 --> 11:36.887
so let's just button it up
with a quick 'no'...

11:39.220 --> 11:41.553
Chuck, welcome.

11:41.637 --> 11:44.553
Hap. Uh. I thought this was
to be our meeting-

11:44.637 --> 11:46.595
My apologies, Chuck,

11:46.679 --> 11:48.428
but I'm here on behalf
of the DOJ,

11:48.512 --> 11:51.220
which has grave concerns
about mobile voting-

11:51.303 --> 11:52.553
Uh. You mean
Jock Jeffcoat does.

11:52.637 --> 11:54.345
Yes, he does.

11:54.428 --> 11:56.637
Given our heightened issues
with cybersecurity-

11:56.720 --> 11:57.762
should we really
trust our entire

11:57.845 --> 11:59.679
electoral system
to mobile voting?

11:59.762 --> 12:02.637
I admit, I share the
Attorney General's objection.

12:02.720 --> 12:04.345
Uh-huh.

12:06.303 --> 12:10.887
Well I have an equally pressing
concern-democracy.

12:10.970 --> 12:12.845
And inclusiveness.

12:12.929 --> 12:15.303
Which is why it's vital
we approve mobile voting...

12:15.387 --> 12:17.053
This is about
more people voting.

12:17.136 --> 12:18.637
Which is the American ideal.

12:18.720 --> 12:21.011
It's about what's right.

12:21.095 --> 12:23.261
Which is your
board's mandate, Hap.

12:23.345 --> 12:26.679
Let us seize this opportunity
to be true patriots.

12:26.762 --> 12:29.011
To bring a voice
to those without one.

12:29.095 --> 12:31.220
I propose
a-a pilot program

12:31.303 --> 12:32.845
to test the efficacy
of mobile voting-

12:32.929 --> 12:35.011
We're all moved.

12:35.095 --> 12:37.553
Our hankies are damp.

12:39.053 --> 12:41.762
Well, strong men also cry,
ya know?

12:41.845 --> 12:45.345
Not really crying, Chuck.

12:45.428 --> 12:46.887
We're looking to
rule against.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.011
But thank you
for dropping by.

12:49.095 --> 12:51.261
Yeah,
thanks for coming in.

12:51.345 --> 12:55.428
dramatic music

13:02.637 --> 13:05.095
Perhaps you got to me T.,
with your brimstone.

13:05.178 --> 13:07.470
And perhaps donkeys
will sprout wings

13:07.553 --> 13:09.720
and fly to heaven
every time a fat man burps.

13:09.804 --> 13:12.845
Hmm.
No, this is a litmus.

13:12.929 --> 13:15.303
You want to know what's behind
Jock's opposition to it.

13:15.387 --> 13:17.887
He doesn't do anything
by accident.

13:20.220 --> 13:24.053
You know. Moments like this
remind me of Morgenthau.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.387
Robert Morris?
Hallowed name.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.887
One of the greatest
ever to hold my office.

13:27.970 --> 13:29.679
Before becoming
DA for life.

13:29.762 --> 13:32.011
Well. He came to mind because of
what we could be doing here.

13:32.095 --> 13:34.470
Instead of stopping
people from voting.

13:34.553 --> 13:37.053
You trying out for
community board rep?

13:37.136 --> 13:39.303
Are you trying out for
Sturmbannfuhrer?

13:39.387 --> 13:42.261
I was following a direct order
from my superior-

13:42.345 --> 13:43.929
Exactly what
Herr Adolf Eichmann said

13:44.011 --> 13:45.637
when they caught him
in Argentina-

13:45.720 --> 13:48.720
Don't speak any more
German at me.

13:48.804 --> 13:51.053
Jock told me to go shut it down.
What should I have done?

13:51.136 --> 13:52.470
In American then?

13:52.553 --> 13:53.720
Refuse the order.

13:55.553 --> 13:57.762
Like Dawson and Downey should've
with the code red.

13:57.845 --> 13:59.136
Just...

14:06.970 --> 14:10.720
Mm. Donna said you wanted
the Sunday Salad.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.470
Now I know
what keeps you so fit.

14:12.553 --> 14:14.470
Fucking uncharitable,
Chuck.

14:14.553 --> 14:15.553
What do you want?

14:15.637 --> 14:17.387
Open and fair elections.

14:17.470 --> 14:19.387
Yeah. Well, I'd like to
tap dance like Gregory Hines.

14:19.470 --> 14:21.887
But I have neither the shoes
nor the rhythm to pull that off.

14:21.970 --> 14:24.637
No. You don't have the will.
But I do.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.428
Time to get my blockchain voting
pilot program out of the gates.

14:27.512 --> 14:29.970
Ah, you're not gonna get
a fucking pilot program.

14:30.053 --> 14:32.303
Why so strong against this?

14:32.387 --> 14:34.387
Do you like Jock that much?

14:34.470 --> 14:35.929
Dislike you that much.

14:36.011 --> 14:38.303
My wife. Cheryl.
Lovely woman.

14:38.387 --> 14:41.178
Every year for the past 23 years
I take Cheryl to Aruba.

14:41.261 --> 14:44.178
She relaxes down there,
we reconnect down there.

14:44.261 --> 14:47.845
But this year you decided to
indict 30 of my best friends,

14:47.970 --> 14:50.637
in Albany, merely for doing
what every state senator's

14:50.720 --> 14:52.679
been doing for the past
hundred years-

14:52.762 --> 14:54.595
favor trade for
the betterment of the state.

14:54.679 --> 14:56.053
And now I'll be lucky if

14:56.136 --> 14:58.470
the wife and I can
catch the bus to Belmar.

14:58.553 --> 15:00.637
So. Your thirty crooked
legislators aren't around

15:00.720 --> 15:02.845
to hit you with those
tasty Lulus anymore,

15:02.929 --> 15:06.470
and you're facing a celibate
stay-cation and that's my fault?

15:06.553 --> 15:08.345
I-I didn't say
any of that.

15:08.428 --> 15:11.595
But I do share the DOJ's concern
with election security,

15:11.679 --> 15:13.637
so I'm leaning into
my veto power.

15:13.720 --> 15:16.387
Something I learned
from the old Westerns:

15:16.470 --> 15:18.303
If you're gonna make
a show of strength,

15:18.387 --> 15:20.762
you wanna be sure you're
the real strongman in the room.

15:20.845 --> 15:24.970
Or you make sure that that guy
steps into the fight for you.

15:25.053 --> 15:26.595
Ooh.

15:26.679 --> 15:29.553
So. Jock did get to you.
Ah.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.637
Why is this so important to him,
do you think?

15:33.720 --> 15:35.220
dramatic music

15:39.095 --> 15:41.428
Chew real good, make sure
not to choke on your cud.

15:41.512 --> 15:43.470
Oh. And go buy
those tap shoes.

15:43.553 --> 15:45.220
Cuz sure as
you're standing there,

15:45.303 --> 15:47.220
I'm about to
make you dance.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.762
-Thank you for coming.
-My pleasure.

15:58.887 --> 16:02.136
-Please.
-Thank you.

16:02.220 --> 16:05.011
Are you sure you're ready
for this to become public?

16:05.095 --> 16:06.387
Because that will
inevitably happen

16:06.470 --> 16:07.887
if we continue
on this course.

16:07.970 --> 16:10.679
Absolutely.
The truth needs to come out.

16:18.720 --> 16:21.136
And now it's our
distinct pleasure

16:21.220 --> 16:23.845
to have legendary
Wall Street operator

16:23.929 --> 16:26.804
from Axe Capital Michael Wagner
here with us

16:26.887 --> 16:28.387
to light this year's tree.

16:34.929 --> 16:36.512
Stacy, thank you.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.053
It is an honor to be here

16:38.136 --> 16:39.804
for this great
Wall Street tradition.

16:39.887 --> 16:42.053
And for another
great tradition,

16:42.136 --> 16:45.970
come see this man at
a charity boxing match

16:46.053 --> 16:47.428
for a great cause.

16:47.512 --> 16:48.679
And now...

16:48.762 --> 16:53.553
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

16:53.637 --> 16:55.178
Let there be lights!

16:57.011 --> 17:00.303
Risin' up,
back on the street

17:00.387 --> 17:01.679
Embrace the pain!

17:01.762 --> 17:02.929
Did my time, took my chances

17:03.011 --> 17:03.929
Is that all you got?!
Yeah.

17:04.011 --> 17:05.804
Show me what you've got,
Mafee!

17:05.887 --> 17:07.470
Go! Get up there!
You got to dig a little deeper!

17:07.553 --> 17:09.345
Dig a little deeper! Come on!

17:09.428 --> 17:10.929
How much longer?

17:11.011 --> 17:13.095
How much longer?
Are you serious right now?

17:13.178 --> 17:14.929
We're just getting
warmed up!

17:15.011 --> 17:16.178
It's the eye of the tiger
Keep that up.

17:16.261 --> 17:18.345
It's the dream of the fight

17:18.428 --> 17:19.887
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

17:19.970 --> 17:22.136
Keep your damn
hands up!

17:22.220 --> 17:23.679
And the last-known survivor
stalks his prey in the night

17:23.762 --> 17:24.512
Ah!
Go, damn it!

17:24.595 --> 17:26.387
Go harder!

17:26.470 --> 17:28.095
I want you to hit him so hard,
I want you to feel

17:28.178 --> 17:29.720
the bones crunch up in his face
in your fist!

17:29.804 --> 17:31.512
Ah!
There you go.

17:31.595 --> 17:33.845
He's gonna feel that one
for sure!

17:37.011 --> 17:41.136
Face to face,
out in the heat

17:41.220 --> 17:45.553
Hangin' tough,
stayin' hungry

17:45.637 --> 17:49.053
They stack the odds till
we take to the street

17:49.136 --> 17:50.804
You got it, Bill.

17:50.887 --> 17:52.804
...with the skill
to survive

17:52.887 --> 17:53.887
There you go.

17:53.970 --> 17:56.345
It's the eye of the tiger

17:56.428 --> 17:58.387
You start hitting
the bag yet?

17:58.470 --> 18:01.136
Risin' up to the challenge
of our rival

18:01.220 --> 18:02.303
-You got this!
-That's it.

18:02.387 --> 18:03.679
You got it!
It's all up here!

18:03.762 --> 18:04.887
Come on!

18:04.970 --> 18:07.220
Let's go!

18:07.303 --> 18:11.929
And he's watchin' us all with
the eye of the tiger

18:17.762 --> 18:19.470
Come on.
This is the best thing for you.

18:24.011 --> 18:26.470
The eye of the tiger

18:26.553 --> 18:29.637
Well. You're supposed to be
the retail specialist.

18:29.720 --> 18:32.762
Yeah. So find me the goddamn
shares off exchange Jerry-

18:32.845 --> 18:34.220
or I'll get someone
who fucking will.

18:34.303 --> 18:36.178
Rough morning
for Jerry.

18:36.261 --> 18:39.178
Made my first move on Saler's.
I bought up 8%.

18:39.261 --> 18:41.762
Yeah. I saw that on the tape,
figured it was you.

18:41.845 --> 18:44.762
Problem is, is that I need over
10% to force the takeover vote

18:44.845 --> 18:47.178
and if I keep sucking them up
in the regular market,

18:47.261 --> 18:49.220
I'll drive the price
through the roof.

18:49.303 --> 18:51.053
I'm trying to have my guy
gather shares

18:51.136 --> 18:53.303
from high net worth families
and indexes.

18:53.387 --> 18:57.095
Well, you know. Maybe,
just maybe this is

18:57.178 --> 18:58.804
the universe sending you
a message

18:58.887 --> 19:00.178
and you should go ahead
and receive it:

19:00.261 --> 19:02.220
That this company's
not for you.

19:02.303 --> 19:03.804
The only message
the universe sends me

19:03.887 --> 19:05.428
is that it's gonna keep
expanding for a while,

19:05.512 --> 19:07.345
so I might as well
expand too.

19:07.428 --> 19:09.428
Look, if anyone can turn this
chain around, it's you...

19:09.512 --> 19:11.261
but why?

19:11.345 --> 19:14.178
There are healthier businesses.
Better choices.

19:16.136 --> 19:17.679
You know I grew up
in a small town.

19:17.762 --> 19:19.637
Yeah. End of the road shit town
is what you called it.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.679
Yeah.

19:21.762 --> 19:24.595
When I was a little kid and
that catalog came in the mail-

19:24.679 --> 19:27.929
it was evidence that there was
a bigger world out there.

19:28.011 --> 19:30.095
Full of everything
you could imagine.

19:30.178 --> 19:32.470
Whatever I could think of,
they sold it.

19:32.553 --> 19:35.387
Yeah. But you wouldn't wear
or use anything they sell now.

19:35.470 --> 19:37.804
That's why I'm going to
turn this bitch around.

19:37.887 --> 19:40.095
So people love it
like I did.

19:40.178 --> 19:42.887
You know, I used to wonder
why I got so rich-

19:42.970 --> 19:45.261
Yeah. Me too. You actually
come up with an answer?

19:45.345 --> 19:48.553
Yeah.
So I could do this.

19:48.637 --> 19:52.845
Show young girls that they don't
have to just dream about

19:52.929 --> 19:55.136
shopping at
some department store.

19:55.220 --> 19:57.929
They can buy
the whole company.

19:58.011 --> 20:00.095
dramatic music

20:00.178 --> 20:02.845
Well.
Then go do it.

20:08.762 --> 20:12.720
Dad, I need you to juice me in
with the tribe.

20:12.804 --> 20:14.637
Son, I'm surprised.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.345
You've worked alongside
the Hebrews your entire career.

20:17.428 --> 20:20.095
You know, there was
a nasty rumor once

20:20.178 --> 20:23.053
about my grandfather being
of Ukrainian extraction-

20:23.136 --> 20:26.345
No, Dad.
The Cayuga Iroquois.

20:26.428 --> 20:28.512
My casino Indians?

20:28.595 --> 20:31.178
A mere three-word sentence,

20:31.261 --> 20:33.845
yet myriad problems
with it.

20:33.929 --> 20:35.512
You partnered with them

20:35.595 --> 20:37.220
on the land around the casino
in Kingsford.

20:37.303 --> 20:38.887
Yeah?
Are you still on good terms?

20:38.970 --> 20:40.679
Couldn't be better.
What is this about?

20:40.762 --> 20:43.512
Blockchain voting.
From cell phones.

20:43.595 --> 20:47.095
My man compiled a list of groups
that applied for mobile voting.

20:47.178 --> 20:49.303
As it turns out,
people want to vote.

20:49.387 --> 20:51.553
The results of
those requests though:

20:51.637 --> 20:53.970
Military overseas, denied.

20:54.053 --> 20:55.762
Rural townships, denied.

20:55.845 --> 20:57.470
Indigenous peoples.
Like my Indians.

20:57.553 --> 20:59.804
Sure. Fine.
Okay. Fantastic.

20:59.887 --> 21:01.387
I don't care to
correct you again

21:01.470 --> 21:03.762
'cause it'll just
make you go darker.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.553
I want to set up a pilot program
to help them.

21:06.637 --> 21:10.345
And to fuck Jock.

21:10.428 --> 21:12.970
For that, I will
set up a meeting.

21:13.053 --> 21:15.845
Smashing.
Thank you.

21:15.929 --> 21:19.512
The vigorish serves
the poor, the hungry,

21:19.595 --> 21:21.845
those that none of you
actually care about,

21:21.929 --> 21:23.303
but the winnings-

21:23.387 --> 21:26.512
the blue cheese,
or white meat or cake-

21:26.595 --> 21:28.387
that goes to you.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.637
The book is open.
Come-n-geddit.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.261
You can buy a round,
you can buy time on canvas.

21:33.345 --> 21:35.762
All action booked,
booked and paid.

21:35.845 --> 21:38.178
Pay the doctors, boy.

21:38.261 --> 21:39.220
Thank you.

21:39.303 --> 21:40.512
C'mere.

21:40.595 --> 21:42.303
Me?

21:42.387 --> 21:44.637
You seem fit.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.261
I need you to hit me.

21:46.345 --> 21:47.845
Uh, no.

21:47.929 --> 21:49.679
Don't worry,
I won't hit you back.

21:49.762 --> 21:51.095
You'll be doing me a favor,

21:51.178 --> 21:52.220
I need to practice
my head movements.

21:52.303 --> 21:53.804
Wing some hooks at me.

21:53.887 --> 21:55.512
I took piano.

21:55.595 --> 21:57.428
What? You're worried about
your dainty hands,

21:57.512 --> 21:59.845
like you're a fucking
neurosurgeon?

21:59.929 --> 22:01.929
I'll do it.

22:04.887 --> 22:06.512
Come on. Let's go.

22:09.637 --> 22:12.512
mid-tempo music

22:12.595 --> 22:14.720
Great. C'mon.

22:17.679 --> 22:19.178
Who wants a parlay?
Who wants odds? Who wants...

22:19.261 --> 22:20.929
Okay, I'm going to
bob and slip-

22:21.011 --> 22:21.887
Ahh!

22:30.095 --> 22:32.095
What's the thing?

22:32.178 --> 22:33.428
Dollar Bill is sparring.

22:33.512 --> 22:34.804
With Bonnie.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.553
If she was
going in the ring,

22:36.637 --> 22:38.303
this thing would be over
in the first round.

22:38.387 --> 22:40.011
By knockout.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.053
I can't go out there.
Not like this...

22:44.136 --> 22:46.679
It's okay, Baby Billy.

22:46.762 --> 22:49.178
You're kinda fucked up
about this, huh?

22:49.261 --> 22:50.553
If you can connect on me
like that,

22:50.637 --> 22:51.970
what's gonna happen
in the ring?

22:52.053 --> 22:53.428
I sucker-punched you.

22:53.512 --> 22:56.178
And I only landed a few...
dozen after that...

22:57.720 --> 22:59.804
But I knew
you wouldn't hit back.

22:59.887 --> 23:01.845
Mafee won't have
that luxury.

23:01.929 --> 23:04.095
I know but...

23:04.178 --> 23:06.929
he's got the young legs,
and a longer reach and...

23:07.011 --> 23:10.053
And those younger legs.

23:10.136 --> 23:12.220
Now that's just
downright mean.

23:12.303 --> 23:14.345
I just want to carry

23:14.428 --> 23:17.512
the Axe Cap torch,
you know?

23:17.595 --> 23:19.136
Win for you guys.

23:19.220 --> 23:21.637
Mafee may have youth
on his side,

23:21.720 --> 23:23.261
but so did Donny Lalonde

23:23.345 --> 23:25.428
when he lost the title
to Sugar Ray Leonard.

23:25.512 --> 23:28.095
I'm Sugar Ray?

23:28.178 --> 23:30.303
Totally.

23:30.387 --> 23:34.053
You're gonna win because
you've got more heart.

23:40.845 --> 23:43.011
We're dead.

23:45.970 --> 23:47.595
Yup.

23:47.679 --> 23:50.053
Uh. Your visitor from
the Medical Board is here.

23:50.136 --> 23:52.553
Oh. Send him in.

23:55.011 --> 23:56.261
Dr. Rhoades.

23:56.345 --> 23:58.929
Dr. Zhang.
So good to see you.

23:59.011 --> 24:01.178
Sit down.

24:01.261 --> 24:04.178
Thank you for
making the time.

24:04.261 --> 24:05.887
Happy to.
Whatever you need.

24:05.970 --> 24:08.637
Some questions.

24:13.261 --> 24:15.178
What is
your exact title?

24:15.261 --> 24:18.762
Performance coach
and Head of HR.

24:18.845 --> 24:21.970
And you prescribe
medication?

24:22.053 --> 24:26.095
When necessary.

24:26.178 --> 24:29.095
And you have private
one-on-one sessions

24:29.178 --> 24:30.553
with employees here?

24:30.637 --> 24:34.053
With some.
For some it's just occasional,

24:34.136 --> 24:36.637
others not at all.
We don't force anybody.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.553
dramatic music

24:38.637 --> 24:40.929
And how personal would you say
these sessions are?

24:41.011 --> 24:44.845
You're not here to ask me to
speak at a conference, are you?

24:44.929 --> 24:48.553
Forgive me. I should have been
more clear when I called.

24:48.637 --> 24:51.762
Dr. Rhoades, your medical
license is under review.

24:51.845 --> 24:55.387
I'm sorry. Why?

24:55.470 --> 24:58.512
There have been
accusations of malpractice.

24:58.595 --> 25:01.512
Ethical misconduct,
misuse of confidential records.

25:01.595 --> 25:04.136
At this time,
I'm not permitted

25:04.220 --> 25:06.220
to disclose the source
of the allegations.

25:06.303 --> 25:08.220
You have rights.

25:08.303 --> 25:11.470
Eventually you will appear
before the Board for a hearing.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.553
We will decide
whether or not to revoke.

25:13.637 --> 25:17.011
dramatic music

25:22.762 --> 25:26.011
Hey. You here to prep me
on Halftime Report?

25:29.845 --> 25:31.804
What's the matter
with you?

25:31.887 --> 25:36.470
You're not the only one
Taylor took aim at.

25:36.553 --> 25:39.637
They reported me
to the Medical Board.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.220
I might
lose my license.

25:41.303 --> 25:42.470
Fuck.

25:42.553 --> 25:44.637
You're going to fight this.
Am I?

25:44.720 --> 25:47.178
I almost
spilled everything.

25:47.261 --> 25:49.512
I didn't, obviously.

25:49.595 --> 25:52.470
I thought about what you would
do and kept my mouth shut.

25:52.553 --> 25:54.053
Good!

25:54.136 --> 25:55.845
But if I was on that board,
I'd strip me.

25:55.929 --> 25:57.929
I'd skin me.

25:58.011 --> 25:59.845
I wasn't careless
with my records,

25:59.929 --> 26:01.553
and I didn't just
hover on the sideline

26:01.637 --> 26:04.845
while you and Chuck
executed some revenge move.

26:04.929 --> 26:09.095
I drew up the play, called my
own number and ran it myself.

26:09.178 --> 26:10.345
Are you done?

26:10.428 --> 26:11.929
I violated
a patient's trust.

26:12.011 --> 26:14.804
Taylor attacked, and you
just stood your ground-

26:14.887 --> 26:17.428
it's what we do.
So self-immolate later.

26:17.512 --> 26:18.970
Or better never.

26:19.053 --> 26:20.845
You are
Doctor Wendy Fucking Rhoades.

26:20.929 --> 26:22.220
No one's taking
your license.

26:22.303 --> 26:23.929
And even if they did-
what does it matter?

26:24.011 --> 26:26.303
You're still the best
at what you do.

26:26.387 --> 26:29.845
Thank you.

26:29.929 --> 26:32.804
Oh, we were supposed to be
prepping Halftime Report.

26:32.887 --> 26:36.845
Don't worry about it,
I know what I want to say.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.345
Axe,
so I'm sure you know,

26:38.428 --> 26:39.887
Taylor Mason was just
on the show.

26:39.970 --> 26:41.679
Taylor's got a sharp mind.

26:41.762 --> 26:44.720
I saw it right away,
cultivated it.

26:44.804 --> 26:46.679
Unfortunately I had to
show them the door

26:46.762 --> 26:48.387
once their ethics
became clear.

26:48.470 --> 26:50.387
What are you saying?
Be more explicit.

26:50.470 --> 26:52.303
That they're dirty?

26:52.387 --> 26:54.178
Oh come on, that's bullshit.
Put it this way:

26:54.261 --> 26:55.720
you either want to be in bed

26:55.804 --> 26:57.136
with the Russian oligarchs
or you don't-

26:57.220 --> 26:58.553
Didn't Taylor
meet him through you?

26:58.637 --> 27:00.470
Yes. Yes,

27:00.553 --> 27:02.845
and when I refused to
take his money on board,

27:02.929 --> 27:05.679
because I didn't feel good
about where it came from,

27:05.762 --> 27:08.804
Taylor didn't hesitate
to grab it.

27:08.887 --> 27:10.929
And then they lost
all the money anyway.

27:11.011 --> 27:14.470
Look, look, a person

27:14.553 --> 27:16.553
who'd sell out
their own father-

27:16.637 --> 27:19.345
there's a chip missing there,
you know what I mean?

27:19.428 --> 27:21.178
You got
specifics on that?

27:21.261 --> 27:23.512
Well. There was a rumor-
you know, their-

27:23.595 --> 27:25.136
their father had a company,

27:25.220 --> 27:27.720
and Taylor flipped it
for their own profit.

27:27.804 --> 27:30.637
Bottom line is this,

27:30.720 --> 27:33.011
it's a relationship
business.

27:33.095 --> 27:35.345
Now, they can call me
a dinosaur if they want,

27:35.428 --> 27:39.428
but loyalty is still
a very important quality to me.

27:39.512 --> 27:44.178
And Taylor Mason, unfortunately,
is someone you can't trust.

27:44.261 --> 27:46.595
Axe. Really great to have
you on-We appreciate it.

27:46.679 --> 27:50.136
Sure.
Yeah. It's been great having-

27:50.220 --> 27:52.303
Yeah?

27:52.387 --> 27:54.720
Taylor just called in.

27:54.804 --> 27:56.887
Axe, we did not
plan this.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.595
I swear, we would
never ambush you.

27:58.679 --> 28:00.303
You want to
get out of here?

28:00.387 --> 28:03.720
No. No. Put them on.
It'll be fun.

28:03.804 --> 28:05.387
Ready?
Ready.

28:05.470 --> 28:07.887
Okay. Uh.
Taylor, welcome back.

28:07.970 --> 28:09.178
I know
you want to respond

28:09.261 --> 28:10.637
to some of these things...

28:10.720 --> 28:12.470
Axe is on the defensive
because he knows

28:12.553 --> 28:14.720
he's dead wrong about
the fracking refineries.

28:14.804 --> 28:16.470
We've all heard
the horror stories:

28:16.553 --> 28:18.345
lightning coming out of
faucets, earthquakes.

28:18.428 --> 28:19.845
New York State
banned fracking because

28:19.929 --> 28:22.011
it's not safe to take the stuff
out of the ground.

28:22.095 --> 28:24.053
So why's it a good idea to
truck it in from Pennsylvania?

28:24.136 --> 28:25.887
Taylor, you're smarter
than that.

28:25.970 --> 28:28.011
The whole flames thing
is an urban legend,

28:28.095 --> 28:29.679
this whole thing
is safe,

28:29.762 --> 28:31.011
and you don't care
about safe anyway.

28:31.095 --> 28:32.720
You're just talking your book.
-Yeah.

28:32.804 --> 28:33.970
That's more
your style, Axe.

28:34.053 --> 28:35.637
I talk numbers and facts.

28:35.720 --> 28:36.762
I don't lobby
behind the scenes.

28:36.845 --> 28:38.428
Or pretend
I fired someone

28:38.512 --> 28:39.804
who bested me
every which way.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.637
Besting me?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.804
Is that what you're calling
lying and pilfering?

28:43.887 --> 28:45.387
With nothing to show for it,
by the way.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.804
You mean besides
the Firefighters Fund?

28:47.887 --> 28:49.970
The jewel in your
crown, and they came to me.

28:50.053 --> 28:51.929
They were finally fed up
with your legal troubles-

28:52.011 --> 28:53.637
not to mention the killing
you made on 9/11,

28:53.720 --> 28:55.428
profiting from tragedy.

28:55.512 --> 28:57.011
You are way
out of your depth.

28:57.095 --> 28:58.679
I've been crushing the S&P
since you were in

28:58.762 --> 29:00.303
fucking footie pajamas-
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-

29:00.387 --> 29:02.095
-Yeah!
-Fuck, yeah!

29:02.178 --> 29:03.387
And now you're about to take
a bath on the refineries,

29:03.470 --> 29:04.637
so you're coming on TV
to kill the stock.

29:04.720 --> 29:06.387
Guys. Maybe-
Taylor, the fact is,

29:06.470 --> 29:07.762
you stabbed me
in the back.

29:07.845 --> 29:09.387
You're down
a few billion AUM

29:09.470 --> 29:10.887
and now you're
trying to salvage

29:10.970 --> 29:12.887
your tanking company
by attacking me.

29:12.970 --> 29:15.345
But I'm gonna kick your ass
in the energy sector,

29:15.428 --> 29:17.595
same way I'm gonna
kick your ass in the ring.

29:17.679 --> 29:19.637
Hold on. Hold on now-
for our audience at home

29:19.720 --> 29:21.220
that doesn't know
what's going on-

29:21.303 --> 29:23.053
he's not literally going to
beat Taylor up.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.345
Their traders are about to
slug it out for charity.

29:28.804 --> 29:30.762
You know what?
I'll bet Taylor

29:30.845 --> 29:33.303
one million dollars
that my man beats theirs.

29:35.011 --> 29:36.428
Two million
he knocks him out.

29:38.887 --> 29:40.637
Taylor, you want
to respond to that?

29:40.720 --> 29:42.261
I don't negotiate with bullies.

29:42.345 --> 29:44.762
He's trying to box me in.
But I have a choice.

29:44.845 --> 29:46.136
And it's one
many on the Street

29:46.220 --> 29:48.345
are starting to recognize
and take.

29:48.428 --> 29:50.804
And that is: to not do
business with Bobby Axelrod.

29:50.887 --> 29:52.261
It's why
I left Axe Cap,

29:52.345 --> 29:54.762
and why many of his investors
are fleeing too.

29:54.845 --> 29:57.553
Taylor, you're-
Hey. Sorry.

29:57.637 --> 29:59.428
Sorry guys,
we've gotta wrap it up,

29:59.512 --> 30:01.637
it's been interesting
to say the least...

30:04.428 --> 30:07.470
Well. Fucking. Done.

30:07.553 --> 30:09.845
Thank you for
the firefighter prompt.

30:09.929 --> 30:11.220
Your timing was perfect.

30:11.303 --> 30:12.929
I'm happy it was useful.

30:23.345 --> 30:25.720
As the adrenaline recedes,

30:25.804 --> 30:27.845
I'm starting to get
a new perspective.

30:27.929 --> 30:29.637
That didn't actually
go so well, did it?

30:29.720 --> 30:31.512
Depends.
Were you aiming to be

30:31.595 --> 30:32.887
the Henry Rollins
of Wall Street?

30:32.970 --> 30:34.762
All aggro rage.

30:34.845 --> 30:36.720
I'm not sure that's gonna help
your fracking position.

30:36.804 --> 30:38.720
This is all my fault.

30:38.804 --> 30:40.470
I'm sorry I didn't have my shit
together earlier.

30:40.553 --> 30:41.929
Lobbying ain't gonna
be enough.

30:42.011 --> 30:44.178
Not by the usual methods.

30:44.261 --> 30:45.929
We need to do more.

30:48.470 --> 30:51.929
Thank you for seeing me,
council member Halftown.

30:52.011 --> 30:55.011
I'm here because
I will not sit idly by

30:55.095 --> 30:58.303
while your civil rights
are being hijacked.

30:58.387 --> 31:00.970
Your people need
better access to voting.

31:01.053 --> 31:03.136
I know in the past
you've taken action,

31:03.220 --> 31:06.178
applied for mobile voting
programs but were denied.

31:06.261 --> 31:10.553
Now. As Attorney General,
I can help you make it happen.

31:18.637 --> 31:22.387
As your wise predecessor,
Wilma Mankiller said,

31:22.470 --> 31:23.929
"Leaders are encouraged to

31:24.011 --> 31:25.845
remember seven generations
in the past

31:25.929 --> 31:27.929
and consider seven generations
in the future

31:28.011 --> 31:31.387
when making decisions
that affect the people."

31:31.470 --> 31:33.470
She was Cherokee.

31:33.553 --> 31:35.762
I'm Haudenosaunee.

31:35.845 --> 31:40.053
That would be like me citing
Vince Neil to sell you.

31:40.136 --> 31:42.220
Does Vince Neil
speak to who you are?

31:42.303 --> 31:44.970
Some days.

31:45.053 --> 31:46.762
Mr. Rhoades,
you want me to lobby

31:46.845 --> 31:48.887
the elections board
for you.

31:48.970 --> 31:51.595
Why would I do that for
the people who chiseled us

31:51.679 --> 31:53.428
on the land deal
surrounding the casino?

31:53.512 --> 31:55.845
Chiseled? I thought
'partnership' was more-

31:55.929 --> 31:58.470
Your father has tasted
the fruits of our tribe

31:58.553 --> 32:00.512
in a way that makes us
disinclined

32:00.595 --> 32:02.553
to trust either
him or you.

32:14.053 --> 32:15.762
Well...

32:15.845 --> 32:17.762
There she is.

32:17.845 --> 32:22.220
Ah.
Look at that chin.

32:22.303 --> 32:24.887
I know that chin.

32:24.970 --> 32:28.887
Adorable.
A champion.

32:28.970 --> 32:31.178
She is.

32:31.261 --> 32:34.512
My father will sweeten
your piece on Kingsford

32:34.595 --> 32:36.387
to what you feel
is fair...

32:39.011 --> 32:43.428
Fine. Whatever my overly
generous son needs.

32:43.512 --> 32:47.637
As for
your pilot program.

32:47.720 --> 32:49.053
Send me your proposal.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.428
Then we'll see.

32:50.512 --> 32:53.345
Much appreciated.

32:55.512 --> 32:57.970
Is that my little sister,
for Chrissakes?

32:58.053 --> 33:01.637
Don't worry, Sonny, you'll
always be my only child.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.095
I could use
your counsel.

33:04.178 --> 33:06.011
Turning the tables.

33:06.095 --> 33:08.095
I've been offered
an opportunity

33:08.178 --> 33:11.011
in media technology
that utilizes blockchain.

33:11.095 --> 33:14.095
I'd never ask you
to interfere.

33:14.178 --> 33:15.595
But any intel...

33:15.679 --> 33:17.720
You should proceed-

33:17.804 --> 33:21.220
alternate uses of blockchain
have a future.

33:21.303 --> 33:22.970
Even though Connerty
and your big boss

33:23.053 --> 33:24.261
are trying to shut it down?
Mm.

33:24.345 --> 33:28.345
Chuck Rhoades is lined up
on the other side.

33:28.428 --> 33:30.637
Let's just say he's a little
more motivated on the issue.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.887
I know it's uncomfortable,

33:36.970 --> 33:40.720
these places where my business
and your career intersect.

33:40.804 --> 33:44.553
I am uncomfortable,
but that's not why.

33:44.637 --> 33:49.053
When I helped get Chuck ejected,
it was for the right reasons.

33:49.136 --> 33:53.261
Open the window,
let in some light, some air.

33:53.345 --> 33:56.387
It's still stuffy
as hell in here.

33:56.470 --> 33:58.053
Just promise
you'll leave this place

33:58.136 --> 33:59.345
before you become
so conditioned

33:59.428 --> 34:02.178
you can't function
anywhere else.

34:02.261 --> 34:04.470
You remember when I was a kid,
on my birthday,

34:04.553 --> 34:07.136
and you'd spin me around
before I hit the piÃ±ata?

34:07.220 --> 34:09.303
Sometimes I'd be so dizzy
from all the turning,

34:09.387 --> 34:11.053
I'd end up
just smacking the air.

34:11.136 --> 34:13.094
That's what
I'm feeling like lately.

34:13.178 --> 34:16.053
Just all revved up
to hit something,

34:16.136 --> 34:19.844
but I just can't
lock in on the target.

34:19.929 --> 34:23.303
Then what you need
to do is this:

34:23.387 --> 34:26.219
Take the blindfold off,

34:26.303 --> 34:28.637
wait 'til the brain-fog lifts,
choose your target,

34:28.719 --> 34:31.219
swing as hard as you can,

34:31.303 --> 34:32.719
and take its head off.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.219
dramatic music

34:39.261 --> 34:41.679
So, what is so important
you got to drag me-

34:41.762 --> 34:44.969
Oh, shit.

34:45.053 --> 34:47.428
Don't make me have my people
put these on.

34:47.512 --> 34:50.512
Thirty of my
compatriots in full regalia.

34:50.594 --> 34:52.011
Don't make me
give interviews

34:52.094 --> 34:54.594
about how you are
refusing us the vote.

34:54.679 --> 34:57.220
Don't make me stage
a sit-in at your office-

34:57.303 --> 34:59.637
You're shoving a fucking
arrowhead up my ass?

34:59.720 --> 35:01.178
Oh. How dare you, sir.

35:01.261 --> 35:03.095
Besides,
I'm not shoving it.

35:03.178 --> 35:05.011
You'd be sitting down on it,
of your own accord.

35:05.095 --> 35:06.595
Oh.
But at your weight,

35:06.679 --> 35:08.387
that's where it would
end up for sure.

35:08.470 --> 35:10.929
Oh. So you're
allowed to be insensitive

35:11.011 --> 35:12.595
but I'm not?
Yes.

35:12.679 --> 35:15.220
Fuck.

35:15.303 --> 35:19.720
Yeah. You've got
your pilot program.

35:19.804 --> 35:22.136
Hey.

35:24.887 --> 35:26.345
It's not all stick.

35:26.428 --> 35:28.220
In this envelope
you'll find tickets

35:28.303 --> 35:30.053
and hotel confirmations
for you and the missus.

35:30.136 --> 35:32.303
Aruba.
All expenses paid.

35:40.553 --> 35:42.595
We did some good for
my people just now.

35:42.679 --> 35:45.095
And you are going to
do some good

35:45.178 --> 35:47.887
for one specific little girl,
aren't you.

35:47.970 --> 35:51.178
The 529 college plan
is being funded as we speak.

35:51.261 --> 35:54.220
Okay.

35:54.303 --> 35:56.929
Tell me what we can salvage
and what we can't.

35:57.011 --> 36:00.095
Lobbyists tell me
the can'ts are dominating.

36:00.178 --> 36:02.261
I'd call it
50-50 right now.

36:02.345 --> 36:03.595
It's going to come down
to the governor.

36:03.679 --> 36:05.303
Victor?
He's leaning hard, Axe,

36:05.387 --> 36:07.011
but his guys aren't bending.

36:07.095 --> 36:08.553
He says it's going to
come down to the governor.

36:08.637 --> 36:10.261
What do those two
want to tell me?

36:10.345 --> 36:12.220
That if we sell now,
we can replace the stock

36:12.303 --> 36:14.303
with deep in-the-money
call options.

36:14.387 --> 36:16.428
We'd still realize losses but
we'd be capped on the downside.

36:16.512 --> 36:18.053
Then for their own safety,

36:18.136 --> 36:20.178
they'd better not fucking
set foot in this office.

36:20.261 --> 36:23.178
dramatic music

36:27.804 --> 36:31.136
Okay. Well if it's going to
come down to the governor,

36:31.220 --> 36:34.303
then let's get to
the governor.

36:36.595 --> 36:39.595
Hi, Chuck...

36:42.136 --> 36:43.929
Meet Governor Sweeney
under other auspices,

36:44.011 --> 36:45.428
not fracking...

36:45.512 --> 36:47.095
...but something that
plays to his ego.

36:47.178 --> 36:48.512
Give him no reason
to think you're lobbying

36:48.595 --> 36:50.178
for anything
in particular.

36:50.261 --> 36:51.720
Just that you're
a well-heeled supporter.

36:51.804 --> 36:53.887
Governor.

36:53.970 --> 36:55.303
Pleasure to meet you.

36:55.387 --> 36:58.303
Uh. Am I
the first one here?

36:58.387 --> 37:00.136
Why don't you draw chips
for everyone in the room

37:00.220 --> 37:02.512
so they can all play
on the house.

37:02.595 --> 37:05.178
He means:
give us privacy. Huh?

37:05.261 --> 37:07.637
I cooked a hell of a meal
for you guys.

37:07.720 --> 37:08.970
I'm gonna serve you now.

37:09.053 --> 37:11.345
Come on.

37:11.428 --> 37:13.970
So. Uh.

37:14.053 --> 37:15.345
I thought there were
13 of us.

37:15.428 --> 37:16.887
I only count three plates.

37:16.970 --> 37:19.136
That's right.

37:19.220 --> 37:20.470
This is a donor dinner,
right?

37:20.553 --> 37:22.512
It is.

37:22.595 --> 37:25.512
Except instead of twelve people
at 100k a plate,

37:25.595 --> 37:27.720
I thought
I'd keep it simple.

37:27.804 --> 37:32.428
Write your Super PAC one check
for the full 1.2 mil.

37:34.637 --> 37:37.887
Huh. Clever.

37:37.970 --> 37:40.512
But I'm not getting involved
in the refineries.

37:40.595 --> 37:43.053
Well. That's what
we thought you'd say.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.804
We?

37:44.887 --> 37:46.512
Oh. Jesus, Mary

37:46.595 --> 37:48.720
and Sainted Joseph
the good and kind carpenter.

37:48.804 --> 37:51.345
And like them,
now we are three.

37:51.428 --> 37:53.261
Okay. I see how
this is going to go.

37:53.345 --> 37:56.553
I'm gonna say no and-let me
guess-uh, teachers' strike?

37:56.637 --> 37:59.720
No. Nurses? Or you're gonna
release my tax returns?

37:59.804 --> 38:02.512
Or I'm gonna find Khartoum's
head in my fucking bed?

38:02.595 --> 38:04.804
No horses need be harmed
in the making of this picture.

38:04.887 --> 38:06.637
The universe is kind,
Governor.

38:06.720 --> 38:08.303
Patiently providing
opportunities

38:08.387 --> 38:10.387
to learn what you failed to
in the past.

38:10.470 --> 38:13.345
Yeah. I'm slow, Chuck,
but I'm not that slow.

38:13.428 --> 38:15.929
You guys are gonna win this one,
probably already have,

38:16.011 --> 38:18.762
so I am going to choose
carrot this time.

38:18.845 --> 38:20.303
What'll you have?

38:20.387 --> 38:21.970
Let's fast forward
through the haggling.

38:22.053 --> 38:23.970
This check is sitting here
on this plate.

38:24.053 --> 38:25.387
You'll probably tell me
that the other side

38:25.470 --> 38:27.220
can give you
the same amount.

38:27.303 --> 38:30.345
So why don't you tell me
what you need to get this done.

38:34.762 --> 38:37.220
The keynote slot
at the next meeting

38:37.303 --> 38:39.637
of the National Governors
Association.

38:39.720 --> 38:43.011
Splashy. A springboard to
the presidential. Yeah.

38:43.095 --> 38:44.845
You'll have it.

38:44.929 --> 38:46.970
Really?
Just like that? Huh?

38:47.053 --> 38:50.345
No, it'll be expensive
and a total pain in the ass.

38:50.428 --> 38:53.512
But you'll have it.

38:56.470 --> 38:57.720
Fine.

38:57.804 --> 38:59.679
Then I will, uh,
make sure that

38:59.762 --> 39:01.387
the refineries loophole
stays open.

39:01.470 --> 39:02.970
Great, and why not
put a ring on it

39:03.053 --> 39:04.553
and legalize
the whole damn thing.

39:04.637 --> 39:06.220
Lift the fracking ban?

39:06.303 --> 39:08.053
If you're gonna do a thing,
do it all the way.

39:08.136 --> 39:09.720
Well, I mean,
the environmentalists

39:09.804 --> 39:11.220
will have a field day-
Think of the Upstate jobs.

39:11.303 --> 39:14.053
The tax revenue.

39:16.470 --> 39:20.011
All right, I'll, uh-
I'll...do my best.

39:20.095 --> 39:22.679
Do better than that.

39:22.762 --> 39:25.303
I just gave you
1.2 million soldiers.

39:25.387 --> 39:26.929
That should help.

39:27.011 --> 39:29.261
dramatic music

39:32.595 --> 39:34.762
Put your fucking forks down.
We're leaving.

39:36.845 --> 39:38.011
Hey!

39:38.095 --> 39:39.178
Chow time.

39:41.470 --> 39:42.887
...And so, General,

39:42.970 --> 39:44.679
with the Native Americans
prepared to get vocal,

39:44.762 --> 39:47.428
the news on
mobile voting isn't good.

39:47.512 --> 39:50.095
I thought Sam Houston
and the Texas Rangers

39:50.178 --> 39:52.762
took care of this shit
a hundred and fifty years ago.

39:52.845 --> 39:55.095
Looks like they left you
some work to do.

39:55.178 --> 39:56.637
Whatever you need me to do,
I'm ready.

39:56.720 --> 39:59.929
Find a way to introduce
an infected blanket,

40:00.011 --> 40:02.428
like good ol'
Lord Jeff Amherst.

40:11.637 --> 40:13.845
dramatic music

40:19.261 --> 40:20.762
Steven.
Hey.

40:20.845 --> 40:22.929
Whoa.

40:23.011 --> 40:25.553
I'm glad we could finally
get this on the books.

40:25.637 --> 40:27.679
Yeah. Wendy,
it's great to see you.

40:27.762 --> 40:32.387
Um. Listen...my counter-intel
has found out

40:32.470 --> 40:34.387
that you're having some problems
with your medical license?

40:34.470 --> 40:36.553
And my board doesn't think
it's such a good idea

40:36.637 --> 40:39.178
for me to be
coached by you.

40:39.261 --> 40:42.470
Oh.

40:42.553 --> 40:45.303
Can we sit?

40:45.387 --> 40:47.428
Yeah. Of course.

40:50.178 --> 40:52.512
This is exactly the kind of
thing we need to start with.

40:52.595 --> 40:54.095
It sounds like
your board is

40:54.178 --> 40:56.345
flexing its muscles,
exerting pressure.

40:56.428 --> 40:58.220
And you gave into it.

40:58.303 --> 40:59.553
I guess.
Let's talk about that.

40:59.637 --> 41:00.929
Why do you think
your board has

41:01.011 --> 41:02.512
that kind of influence
over you-

41:02.595 --> 41:03.929
Wendy...I-I see
what you're doing.

41:04.011 --> 41:05.512
And I'm going to
stop you right there.

41:05.595 --> 41:07.470
My board has stated that
I can't have a session

41:07.553 --> 41:10.053
with a doctor who's facing
an ethics hearing.

41:10.136 --> 41:14.136
It'll make me seem
as sketchy as you.

41:25.053 --> 41:28.720
rock music

41:44.637 --> 41:46.970
Hey, Frank.
How are you?

41:47.053 --> 41:48.595
How are you, Jeff?
How you doing?

41:48.679 --> 41:50.595
You made it.
Got money on your man, Axe.

41:50.679 --> 41:51.762
Meet Rebecca Cantu.
Hi.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.637
Rebecca. Jim Chanos.
How are you?

41:53.720 --> 41:54.970
Pleasure.
Charles.

41:55.053 --> 41:56.220
You look amazing.
You're the man.

41:56.303 --> 41:57.470
Yeah. You look fabulous.

41:57.553 --> 41:59.804
I'll see this weekend?
Awesome.

42:01.345 --> 42:03.178
Axe with
the first grenade

42:03.261 --> 42:04.595
he launched at
your father's company.

42:04.679 --> 42:07.011
Rebecca Cantu.

42:11.887 --> 42:14.053
That's more than
a business relationship.

42:14.136 --> 42:15.762
Hmm.

42:15.845 --> 42:19.595
Wendy Rhoades,
on your six.

42:19.679 --> 42:21.345
dramatic music

42:24.845 --> 42:26.845
You reported me
to the Medical Board?

42:29.637 --> 42:31.095
Yes, I did.

42:31.178 --> 42:32.970
Are you going to say
it wasn't warranted?

42:33.053 --> 42:36.053
Please. Neither of us
is blameless.

42:36.136 --> 42:39.220
I think we both did things
I'd say were pretty fucked up-

42:39.303 --> 42:40.720
The difference is:
I didn't use

42:40.804 --> 42:43.553
your most intimate secrets
to destroy your family.

42:43.637 --> 42:47.637
But you went crying to the
principal's office-dick move.

42:47.720 --> 42:50.553
C'mon,
let's find our seats.

42:55.303 --> 42:57.053
I apologize.

42:57.136 --> 42:59.387
That was the first action I've
taken without your clearance.

42:59.470 --> 43:01.136
It will be the last-

43:01.220 --> 43:03.428
You're worried I'm upset
because you disobeyed me.

43:03.512 --> 43:05.553
But I know why you did it-
to defend me.

43:05.637 --> 43:07.470
And I appreciate it.

43:15.512 --> 43:17.679
I-I don't-I don't think
I can stay for this...

43:19.345 --> 43:20.929
I'll go with you.

43:21.011 --> 43:22.345
Let's get an Uber.

43:22.428 --> 43:24.220
dramatic music

43:27.845 --> 43:29.887
Just remember,
you've prepared enough to win

43:29.970 --> 43:31.136
as long as
you don't rush it.

43:31.220 --> 43:33.220
So, breathe and focus.

43:33.303 --> 43:35.136
Just knock him out.

43:38.595 --> 43:40.345
No matter what happens,

43:40.428 --> 43:43.345
know that I am beside myself
with gratitude and pride.

43:43.428 --> 43:46.428
Asking you to come with me was
the best decision I ever made.

43:46.512 --> 43:49.345
Fuck. No way I can beg out
of the fight after that.

43:49.428 --> 43:52.261
Now fucking
slaughter him.

44:06.804 --> 44:08.553
Bloomberg alert.

44:08.637 --> 44:10.387
Governor's about to
announce on fracking.

44:10.470 --> 44:12.178
Oh, well.

44:12.261 --> 44:14.178
Seems only right that
we should watch his decision

44:14.261 --> 44:15.762
come down together.

44:15.845 --> 44:17.720
My thought exactly.

44:20.762 --> 44:22.720
Jed, we struck oil!

44:22.804 --> 44:24.970
Fracking. Is. Legal!

44:26.178 --> 44:27.553
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

44:27.637 --> 44:30.261
-Whoo!
-Look at that! Yeah!

44:30.345 --> 44:32.679
-Whoo!
-Yes!

44:32.762 --> 44:35.720
Yeah!

44:38.970 --> 44:40.970
What the fuck?

44:41.053 --> 44:43.053
What don't I know?

44:43.136 --> 44:46.595
What's the one thing you need
most when fracking?

44:50.762 --> 44:55.095
We've got our lot...

44:55.178 --> 45:00.136
And the agua is ours.

45:03.220 --> 45:07.804
You bought up
the fucking water rights.

45:07.887 --> 45:09.970
My short position was
actually quite small.

45:10.053 --> 45:11.553
Just enough to get on
the tote board.

45:11.637 --> 45:14.720
You baited me.

45:14.804 --> 45:16.387
You needed
fracking to happen

45:16.470 --> 45:18.679
and so you used me
to make sure that it did.

45:18.762 --> 45:20.387
I certainly couldn't
be seen doing it.

45:20.470 --> 45:22.220
Yet fact,
I made it happen.

45:22.303 --> 45:25.053
So while you'll profit, it's
only fair I make more than you.

45:25.136 --> 45:26.970
I taught you well.

45:27.053 --> 45:29.261
I see that taking credit
for my success

45:29.345 --> 45:31.011
in the midst of defeat
is a kind of balm.

45:31.095 --> 45:32.845
So you go on ahead.

45:32.929 --> 45:34.303
And if you still care to make
a wager on the fight,

45:34.387 --> 45:36.637
I'll do a million
at a buck fifty-to one.

45:36.720 --> 45:38.428
Booked.

45:47.679 --> 45:50.595
Ladies and gentlemen,
fans of the glove game

45:50.679 --> 45:53.804
from around the globe-
welcome to Fight Night!

46:01.053 --> 46:02.512
-Champ! Reigning champ!
-One, two.

46:02.595 --> 46:03.845
-One, two, three.
-You're the best ever.

46:03.929 --> 46:05.261
Style is impetuous...
-Slip!

46:05.345 --> 46:07.053
...your defense is
impregnable...

46:07.136 --> 46:08.303
I smoke on the mic
like smoking Joe Frazier

46:08.387 --> 46:09.720
One, two. One, two.

46:09.804 --> 46:12.303
Thanks, Champ.

46:12.387 --> 46:15.011
We have one more reason
to level these motherfuckers.

46:15.095 --> 46:18.428
Bury him, I buy you two new
houses-one for each wife.

46:18.512 --> 46:20.845
I will, boss.
Damn right he is.

46:20.929 --> 46:23.011
dramatic music

46:23.095 --> 46:24.637
Let's go, baby.
Let's go.

46:24.720 --> 46:26.303
-One, two, three.
-Ah!

46:26.387 --> 46:27.637
-One, two. Jab, jab.
-Ya!

46:27.720 --> 46:29.303
-There you go, baby.
-Ow!

46:29.387 --> 46:31.845
With all the pageantry
and respect

46:31.929 --> 46:34.887
due an event of this magnitude,
here come the fighters.

46:34.970 --> 46:37.970
First in the ring,
Dudley Mafee.

46:38.053 --> 46:40.762
Ah, yes,
the Mauler from Aurora

46:40.845 --> 46:43.220
heading into the ring
at 6'2".

46:43.303 --> 46:45.637
What do you think,
about 218 pounds?

46:45.720 --> 46:47.136
218. That was
the same exact weight

46:47.220 --> 46:48.804
that Tyson was
in his prime.

46:48.887 --> 46:51.303
A very different 218
on the "Iron Mike" Tyson,

46:51.387 --> 46:53.387
Bob, very different.

46:53.470 --> 46:55.512
Next up,
Dollar Bill Stearn.

46:57.470 --> 47:00.345
Getting more of a George
"The Animal" Steele vibe

47:00.428 --> 47:02.220
from this one.
I agree.

47:02.303 --> 47:04.095
There appears to be a little bit
of the animal in this guy.

47:04.178 --> 47:06.470
Amazing.
Axe got Deontay Wilder

47:06.553 --> 47:07.970
in Dollar Bill's corner.

47:08.053 --> 47:10.720
And over
on Team Mafee,

47:10.804 --> 47:13.970
we've got UFC heavyweight champ
Stipe Miocic.

47:14.053 --> 47:17.011
Dollar Bill!
Dollar Bill!

47:24.720 --> 47:27.512
And there's the bell.

47:27.595 --> 47:30.679
All right,
and we're under way.

47:30.762 --> 47:33.303
-We're under way.
-You got this, baby!

47:33.387 --> 47:36.887
And...we're waiting
for someone to get hit.

47:42.595 --> 47:43.762
Ohh!

47:48.387 --> 47:50.512
AC/DC's "T.N.T."
Go! Go! Go! Go!

47:50.595 --> 47:52.679
'Cause I'm T.N.T.

47:52.762 --> 47:54.011
Oh!

47:54.095 --> 47:56.512
I'm dynamite T.N.T.

47:56.595 --> 47:57.470
And I'll win the fight

47:57.553 --> 47:59.929
Dollar!
T.N.T.

48:00.011 --> 48:01.345
Dollar Bill
doesn't follow up.

48:01.428 --> 48:02.762
He just moves back
and celebrates.

48:02.845 --> 48:04.387
T.N.T.

48:05.679 --> 48:09.679
Watch me explode

48:15.261 --> 48:17.011
Oh!

48:17.095 --> 48:21.095
I'm dirty, mean,
and mighty unclean

48:21.178 --> 48:24.679
Not entirely legal, but it's
the first guy to go down.

48:24.762 --> 48:26.345
Public enemy number one

48:26.428 --> 48:28.220
Fuck his ass up!

48:28.303 --> 48:30.679
Understand

48:30.762 --> 48:33.178
Well, patty-cake, and then
there's a baker's man.

48:33.261 --> 48:34.428
Lock up your wife

48:34.512 --> 48:36.095
And with that, Rich,

48:36.178 --> 48:37.387
he just punched him
right in the fucking dick.

48:37.470 --> 48:40.011
Oh, shit.
Again, not entirely legal.

48:40.095 --> 48:43.428
The man is back in town

48:43.512 --> 48:44.929
Don't you mess me 'round

48:46.845 --> 48:48.804
Both of them
losing a lot of energy.

48:48.887 --> 48:50.261
You can tell they're
dripping sweat from everywhere.

48:50.345 --> 48:51.428
They're out of shape.

48:51.512 --> 48:52.804
They're all fucked up.

48:52.887 --> 48:54.470
T.N.T.

48:54.553 --> 48:56.428
-Ohh!
-Come on!

48:56.512 --> 48:58.136
T.N.T.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.220
That's not legal.
I'm gonna be honest, viewers.

49:00.303 --> 49:02.136
This is probably one of
the pussiest fights

49:02.220 --> 49:03.845
I've ever seen in my life.
Oi, oi, oi

49:03.929 --> 49:05.387
T.N.T.

49:05.470 --> 49:06.845
They stopped
fighting before the bell.

49:06.929 --> 49:08.428
I'm dynamite, T.N.T.

49:08.512 --> 49:09.261
And now
Maffe's vomiting.

49:09.345 --> 49:10.804
Ugh.

49:10.887 --> 49:12.011
You got to keep going
right now!

49:12.095 --> 49:13.470
Let's go!
Make it happen!

49:13.553 --> 49:15.011
-Keep going!
-You got to keep going!

49:15.095 --> 49:17.303
T.N.T.

49:19.512 --> 49:21.762
That's
the Bald Bull Charge

49:21.845 --> 49:24.261
from
Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!

49:27.679 --> 49:29.762
All right, this is
quickly becoming a farce here.

49:29.845 --> 49:31.261
Come on!

49:31.345 --> 49:33.136
What is
going on here?

49:33.220 --> 49:35.595
This looks like an audition for
the fucking Walking Dead.

49:35.679 --> 49:38.387
Axe cannot be
happy about this.

49:46.136 --> 49:47.553
Down goes
Dollar Bill.

49:47.637 --> 49:49.303
-Just fucking stand up!
-Get up, Bill!

49:49.387 --> 49:51.887
Stand up!

49:51.970 --> 49:54.595
And Mafee is
trying to pull himself up,

49:54.679 --> 49:55.762
but he's toast.

49:55.845 --> 49:57.679
-Dig deep right now!
-Get up!

49:57.762 --> 49:59.637
Let's go. Get up.
Get the fuck up. Let's go.

49:59.720 --> 50:01.470
We have
two fighters down.

50:01.553 --> 50:03.553
And the round
hasn't even started.

50:09.595 --> 50:11.845
There's
a concession stand in the ring.

50:11.929 --> 50:15.053
This is beyond pathetic,
Bob.

50:18.387 --> 50:20.095
I think they're calling it
a double loss?

50:20.178 --> 50:22.261
When you talk about
the shitbag titty fuck

50:22.345 --> 50:26.095
of the night-
that's another fucking draw.

50:26.178 --> 50:27.929
Ain't gonna be
no rematch.

50:28.011 --> 50:29.720
Don't want one.

50:38.053 --> 50:40.428
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
you will get your money back.

50:40.512 --> 50:42.053
I will do it one at a...

50:44.595 --> 50:45.970
Why's he so happy?

50:46.053 --> 50:48.553
Fight was a draw.
He had push.

50:48.637 --> 50:51.136
I won.
I motherfucking won.

50:51.220 --> 50:53.553
I am a winner.
Because I win.

50:53.637 --> 50:56.053
I motherfucking win.

50:58.011 --> 50:59.095
Not bad.
Mm.

51:00.553 --> 51:01.804
We could blow out that wall,

51:01.887 --> 51:02.720
make a great room.
-Mm-hmm.

51:02.804 --> 51:04.595
Or a man cave for you.

51:04.679 --> 51:08.136
Also just rip up this island
and just flip the whole kitchen.

51:08.220 --> 51:09.720
Yeah. We're gonna re-do
all the floors anyway,

51:09.804 --> 51:11.011
they're like from the '90s-

51:11.095 --> 51:13.095
Sorry, I thought
we'd be done by now.

51:14.470 --> 51:16.011
It's just so great.
We love it.

51:16.095 --> 51:18.011
Nice to meet you.

51:18.095 --> 51:19.512
When are you due?
Next month.

51:19.595 --> 51:20.887
Mm. Your first?

51:20.970 --> 51:22.011
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

51:22.095 --> 51:24.011
Mm.

51:24.095 --> 51:25.679
Good luck.

51:25.762 --> 51:27.428
Thank you.

51:27.512 --> 51:30.762
dramatic music

51:30.845 --> 51:34.345
...Well,
there they were.

51:34.428 --> 51:37.720
We're really going to
sell to them-

51:37.804 --> 51:40.845
So they can come in here
and tear this place apart.

51:40.929 --> 51:43.220
I know you saw those cigars
in his pocket.

51:43.303 --> 51:44.970
He'll be
puffing up a storm.

51:45.053 --> 51:46.970
Whole place
will smell like it.

51:47.053 --> 51:49.178
You're right.

51:49.261 --> 51:53.053
Like it or not,
this is our home.

51:53.136 --> 51:55.637
Was...

51:55.720 --> 51:58.345
And I don't think
I want them living in it.

51:58.428 --> 52:00.512
So we take it
off the market?

52:02.470 --> 52:04.053
Maybe.

52:04.136 --> 52:07.220
Oh, Wend,

52:07.303 --> 52:10.595
oh, I was hoping
you'd say that.

52:10.679 --> 52:12.679
And does that mean

52:12.762 --> 52:16.178
I can, uh, move back
in to the bedroom?

52:16.261 --> 52:20.762
Let's take it one step
at a time, Chuck.

52:28.887 --> 52:30.845
Thank you.

52:34.720 --> 52:37.011
It's no big deal.

52:37.095 --> 52:40.387
You had a shitty,
shitty night.

52:40.470 --> 52:43.011
After a couple of
shitty days.

52:43.095 --> 52:46.720
And you actually took the time
to buy up the shares I needed.

52:46.804 --> 52:50.845
Yeah. I found an index fund
to release a block to me.

52:50.929 --> 52:53.470
There's something for me
in this too.

52:53.553 --> 52:56.011
We combine our shares,

52:56.095 --> 52:58.679
you get to make your takeover
move on Saler's,

52:58.762 --> 53:01.553
and I get a board seat.

53:01.637 --> 53:04.136
I knew it was
important to you...

53:04.220 --> 53:06.553
And so it begins.

53:06.637 --> 53:08.970
Yeah.

53:09.053 --> 53:10.804
Now I'm at
the starting line.

53:10.887 --> 53:13.804
soft music

53:35.136 --> 53:36.220
Why are you
on my site?

53:36.303 --> 53:38.095
Site's closed until
further notice.

53:38.178 --> 53:39.804
The fuck
is this all about?

53:39.887 --> 53:41.637
Security reasons.

53:41.720 --> 53:43.887
This is what
it's about, Dad.

53:45.053 --> 53:49.345
dramatic music

53:49.428 --> 53:53.512
Counterterrorism,
drug enforcement, gangs.

53:53.595 --> 53:55.095
Those illustrious
task forces

53:55.178 --> 53:57.178
are why you are
the nation's finest.

53:57.261 --> 54:00.303
Yes, Mr. Attorney General.
They're the pride of the NYPD.

54:00.387 --> 54:03.970
Yeah. Which is why
I'm pulling 'em.

54:04.053 --> 54:05.970
That prestigious work-

54:06.053 --> 54:08.220
and the deep pocket
funding of it-

54:08.303 --> 54:12.303
will be going instead to
your neighbors in New Jersey.

54:12.387 --> 54:15.845
Now, that might not
make you look too good...

54:15.929 --> 54:19.220
Jesus-

54:19.303 --> 54:21.053
unless what?

54:26.762 --> 54:29.136
I guess this voting thing
does matter that much to 'em.

54:29.220 --> 54:30.929
Then you better
fucking fix it.

54:31.011 --> 54:32.345
Ohhh, I'll fix it.

54:32.428 --> 54:34.345
Like Lyndon Johnson
did the South.

54:34.428 --> 54:36.011
AC/DC's "T.N.T."
Oi, oi, oi

54:36.095 --> 54:37.428
For my own
fucking reasons.

54:37.512 --> 54:48.428
Oi, oi, oi

54:48.512 --> 54:52.053
See me ride out of
the sunset

54:52.136 --> 54:56.095
On your color TV screen

54:56.178 --> 55:00.553
Out for all that I can get

55:00.637 --> 55:04.553
If you know what I mean

55:04.637 --> 55:08.136
Women to the left of me

55:08.220 --> 55:12.095
And women to the right

55:12.178 --> 55:13.887
Ain't got no gun

55:13.970 --> 55:15.845
Ain't got no knife

55:15.929 --> 55:18.804
Don't you start no fight

55:21.053 --> 55:23.136
'Cause I'm T.N.T.

55:23.220 --> 55:25.178
I'm dynamite

55:25.261 --> 55:27.220
T.N.T.

55:27.303 --> 55:29.011
And I'll win the fight

55:29.095 --> 55:30.887
T.N.T.

55:30.970 --> 55:33.053
I'm a power load

55:33.136 --> 55:34.845
T.N.T.

55:34.929 --> 55:37.011
Watch me explode

55:38.305 --> 55:44.733
