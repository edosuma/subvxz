00:01.323 --> 00:03.091
My mom and I are getting
kicked out of our house,

00:03.095 --> 00:05.146
which is why I had to pick
up and move into Summer's.

00:05.181 --> 00:09.279
This woman is the Princess of Orange County
and we'll find a way to use her.

00:09.339 --> 00:10.965
Welcome to Newport Union. I'm Casey.

00:11.034 --> 00:12.397
- Nice to meet you, I'm...
- Johnny!

00:13.180 --> 00:14.344
Everyone calls me Chili.

00:14.504 --> 00:16.842
It's gonna be a problem for
me because I love you.

00:17.412 --> 00:18.330
Marissa...

00:18.801 --> 00:19.957
What's wrong?
What'd you do to her?

00:20.090 --> 00:21.749
Nothing. I'm fine.

00:22.356 --> 00:25.082
This is my...
Boyfriend, I'm guessing. Hey.

00:26.207 --> 00:27.195
She's Taylor Townsend.

00:27.244 --> 00:28.910
She's, like the Karl Rove of our school.

00:28.931 --> 00:31.638
Taylor Townsend...

00:34.077 --> 00:36.131
- Don't touch her!
- Ryan!

00:36.196 --> 00:39.948
Either of you ever set foot near
this school again, I call the police.

00:41.000 --> 00:47.074

00:58.999 --> 01:01.636
Where's all the cereal?
Oh, I guess we're out.

01:03.413 --> 01:04.458
There's no bagels, either?

01:04.477 --> 01:05.825
I thought we'd try something new.

01:06.154 --> 01:07.122
Mom, listen to me.

01:07.201 --> 01:11.586
I understand that this whole "Cooking with
Kirsten" thing is helping you keep focused,

01:11.689 --> 01:15.839
but you cannot preempt a man's
regularly scheduled breakfast.

01:15.903 --> 01:18.589
- It is a sacred routine.
- Sit.

01:21.484 --> 01:22.976
You are having...

01:23.610 --> 01:26.783
Eggs bénédicte gruyère avec pâté de fruits.

01:31.887 --> 01:33.462
Something smells...

01:34.853 --> 01:35.526
fancy.

01:35.584 --> 01:36.700
Have a seat. There's plenty.

01:36.759 --> 01:38.922
Oh, no thanks. I'll just grab
a bagel and a schmear to go.

01:38.991 --> 01:40.017
Good luck with that.

01:46.388 --> 01:48.847
Oh, Dr. Kim. Thanks so much
for getting back to me.

01:54.159 --> 01:56.401
Dr. Kim, as in "Principal" Dr. Kim.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.434
Oh, she's probably confirming our
reservation for the college fair tonight.

02:04.862 --> 02:07.983
You know, you're gonna be exposed to a
lot of new things in college next year.

02:08.062 --> 02:10.836
Yeah, horny coeds and alcohol poisoning.

02:10.857 --> 02:13.276
I just don't think they're gonna
have French fusion on the menu.

02:19.956 --> 02:21.566
They don't want me there
tonight, do they?

02:21.753 --> 02:24.372
No, Harbor's only hosting
and it's a public event.

02:24.402 --> 02:26.936
Dr. Kim says there is no reason
why you can't attend.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.593
So, what do you say you boys meet
us back here, we'll head over together.

02:29.633 --> 02:30.670
Sounds good to me.

02:37.805 --> 02:38.852
What's going on?

02:38.941 --> 02:43.405
Harbor's Dean of Discipline is making it
his personal crusade to ruin Ryan's future.

02:43.612 --> 02:48.363
He's attached a note to his transcript,
detailing his pathologically violent behavior.

02:48.920 --> 02:52.416
Ryan certainly needs to work on his
self-control, but he's not pathological.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.505
- And considering everything he's been through...
- No one's gonna get a chance to consider it.

02:56.910 --> 02:59.429
A letter like that is a red flag
to college boards,

02:59.799 --> 03:01.538
and unless it's rescinded,

03:02.071 --> 03:05.232
no way a reputable school is gonna
want to touch a kid like Ryan.

03:43.104 --> 03:44.961
What color do I want?

03:51.864 --> 03:55.193
You're, like, twice my height.
We can probably figure this out.

03:55.594 --> 04:00.503
Why don't you just...that, right? Yeah?
Solved

04:00.658 --> 04:03.443
Oh, I'm sorry. You must be so sick of
me being in your way all the time.

04:03.492 --> 04:06.801
Oh, are you kidding? I date Cohen, okay?
My patience is infinite.

04:06.900 --> 04:09.773
Beside, having you all up in my space
makes me miss you less at school.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.309
Oh, I miss you guys, too.

04:12.891 --> 04:15.647
You know, we should all
do something tonight.

04:15.700 --> 04:18.427
You know, I told Cohen
I'd go with him to that, um...

04:18.824 --> 04:20.785
What is it called? That college circus thing?

04:20.872 --> 04:21.957
Why don't you come with us?

04:22.010 --> 04:23.843
To Harbor?
I think I'll pass.

04:23.881 --> 04:25.917
What? It's not like your picture
is on the Most Wanted list.

04:25.937 --> 04:28.087
- Have you checked the dean's office?
- Very funny.

04:29.201 --> 04:31.702
Look, I'm not really thinking big
picture right now, anyway.

04:31.915 --> 04:33.772
I mean, college isn't even on my radar.

04:34.724 --> 04:37.376
You're a senior in high school.
How could college not be on your radar?

04:37.416 --> 04:41.118
Let's see-- maybe because I'm homeless,
going to public school and totally broke.

04:42.693 --> 04:44.330
And yet, things could be worse.

04:46.788 --> 04:48.552
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

04:48.575 --> 04:51.018
I'm just checking on you.
How's everything going at Summer's?

04:51.133 --> 04:53.918
Fine, but I'm kind of worried I might be
starting to wear out my welcome a little.

04:54.046 --> 04:55.410
Well, then I have
some good news.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.977
Kirsten's turned me on to a very promising
lead on some beachside property

04:59.505 --> 05:01.304
So if you could just hang on
a little bit longer.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.130
- Sure, I guess.
- Great.

05:07.639 --> 05:10.343
- Is everything okay, Mom?
- Oh, I'm fine, honey.

05:11.008 --> 05:16.458
Okay, I mean, I've been better, but I have
a plan and you have nothing to worry about.

05:17.434 --> 05:19.987
We'll have lunch at the club this week, okay?
I'll call you.

05:30.115 --> 05:32.592
Don't stress out, okay?
You can stay here as long as you want.

05:33.267 --> 05:34.276
Thanks.

05:38.898 --> 05:40.558
Oh! Excuse us, ma'am.

05:41.713 --> 05:42.720
No problem.

05:57.894 --> 06:00.464
Look at her. All coy and texty.

06:00.846 --> 06:02.018
I bet it's the dean.

06:02.047 --> 06:05.134
All, like, "Come over to my creepy apartment.
I'll give you a lesson in discipline."

06:06.355 --> 06:09.221
Be afraid, Cohen.
Be very, very afraid.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.093
If Taylor isn't stopped, who knows how
far she'll take her evil agenda?

06:12.240 --> 06:16.644
Well, you know, she hijacked social chair.
It's not like world domination is inevitable.

06:16.708 --> 06:18.400
Yeah, well, school domination is.

06:18.563 --> 06:21.928
She's got Dean Hess in her back pocket,
front and who knows where else?

06:21.965 --> 06:23.797
Oh, look, I know US Weekly's your bible,

06:23.801 --> 06:26.727
and believe me, I love a good scandal
as much as the next guy but

06:27.862 --> 06:30.452
nothing is going on between
the dean and Taylor Townsend.

06:30.482 --> 06:32.478
I saw what I saw, okay?

06:32.538 --> 06:35.149
Yeah, in a dark hallway in the
middle of a rage blackout.

06:35.151 --> 06:37.272
Isn't it possible you saw
what you wanted to see?

06:37.305 --> 06:40.161
No. No one chooses to witness
something that repellent.

06:45.978 --> 06:47.965
Oh, I'd like to give her a Sidekick.

06:57.632 --> 07:00.291
- Where are you going?
- Recon.

07:00.707 --> 07:02.328
You sure this is a good idea?

07:02.430 --> 07:05.564
- Of course. I want you here.
- Does anyone else?

07:05.662 --> 07:07.956
Well, there's only one way to find out.

07:08.123 --> 07:09.547
- Hi, guys.
- Hi

07:12.008 --> 07:13.283
Is this Ryan?

07:14.973 --> 07:17.375
Yeah, I see why you
didn't break up with him.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.541
Chiseled jaw, deep, soulful eyes.
He's pretty.

07:20.789 --> 07:23.359
Yo, man, you ever get struck by lightning,
I will take care of your woman.

07:23.428 --> 07:26.163
- Yeah, I'm worried.
- You should be. Good to see you again.

07:26.174 --> 07:28.868
Yeah, yeah, good to see you. Sorry about
the other day. I kind of lost my cool.

07:28.930 --> 07:32.575
Hey, man, you see your girl talking to some
guy you don't know-- could happen to anyone.

07:35.867 --> 07:38.477
- So, you guys want to sit with us?
- Sure. Thanks. Cool.

07:40.004 --> 07:41.557
So, you blowing off school today?

07:41.576 --> 07:44.795
Uh, no, actually, I'm doing the
home school thing for a while.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.442
Cool. I thought that was for,
like, Christians and hippies.

07:47.449 --> 07:49.821
And for people who punch the dean
in the face at their private school.

07:49.861 --> 07:51.442
- You did that?
- Yeah.

07:51.531 --> 07:54.244
Yeah, wish I could home-school.
Can't wait to get out of here.

07:54.323 --> 07:56.476
Though, Newport beats
the hell out of Brea.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.703
You from Brea?
Where'd you go to middle school?

07:58.732 --> 08:00.559
- Arovista.
- Chino Hills.

08:00.737 --> 08:02.584
Come on, Marissa, let's
get some frozen yogurt.

08:02.860 --> 08:05.408
- Okay. Ryan, you want anything?
- I'm good. Thanks.

08:05.873 --> 08:08.914
- Dennis, you like frozen yogurt.
- Okay, yeah, I love frozen yogurt.

08:09.013 --> 08:10.613
Yeah, come on, you can
hold our tray for us.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.714
Trust me-- the faster they become
friends, the better off you are.

08:15.017 --> 08:17.022
So, we used to kick your
ass in Pee Wee Football.

08:17.052 --> 08:19.225
- Yeah, I know. I used to play safety.
- Quarterback.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.130
- Really?
- One year.

08:43.702 --> 08:45.884
Okay. At first I thought it was cute.

08:45.980 --> 08:52.392
you following me, obsessing over me. But the
Single White Female thing is so mid-'90s,

08:52.431 --> 08:54.552
and it never ends well for the ugly one.

08:55.015 --> 08:56.487
Could you be more full of yourself?

08:56.517 --> 08:58.835
I have better things to do than
follow your sorry ass around.

08:58.858 --> 09:03.877
Okay, I know it must be hard going from
prom queen to the Invisible Woman, but

09:04.032 --> 09:07.623
what are you trying to prove? That you're not
just sad and pathetic, but you're also crazy?

09:07.672 --> 09:10.452
Oh, you want crazy?
Oh, I will show you crazy.

09:10.992 --> 09:13.193
Okay, you might want to
rethink threatening me.

09:13.463 --> 09:15.943
If you haven't noticed, I'm kind
of close with Dean Hess.

09:15.993 --> 09:17.790
Oh, no, I've noticed.

09:18.290 --> 09:21.378
Well, you know, Dean Hess,
he isn't exactly discreet.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.728
Okay, what does that mean?

09:24.037 --> 09:27.801
Never mind. I have been trying to erase
this image from my brain, like, all day.

09:27.879 --> 09:30.697
Unfortunately, I think it's going
to take, like, serious therapy.

09:30.832 --> 09:33.110
- What image?
- Nothing, I...

09:33.980 --> 09:36.044
Dean Hess could get in, like, a lot of trouble.

09:36.066 --> 09:38.917
I think it's, like, sexual harassment
or something.

09:39.041 --> 09:42.609
- What is?
- Kissing.

09:43.798 --> 09:45.266
Miss Applebaum.

09:45.344 --> 09:49.823
The volleyball coach with the toned
arms and the legs for miles.

09:49.869 --> 09:52.325
I saw them behind the gym
bleachers this morning.

09:54.518 --> 09:56.804
- You're totally lying.
- I wish.

09:57.059 --> 10:01.121
The look on Miss Applebaum's face is,
like, permanently burned into my retinas.

10:01.214 --> 10:04.333
God... pure carnal satisfaction.

10:06.804 --> 10:09.646
Oh, sorry.
I guess I got to go.

10:10.032 --> 10:11.793
You have a super day.

10:14.517 --> 10:16.231
I was going this way.

10:21.976 --> 10:25.714
- So... what do you think?
- Aren't condos for old people?

10:26.054 --> 10:29.975
These units were conceived for young
professionals. Single, divorced executive types.

10:29.998 --> 10:31.027
How much are we talking?

10:31.031 --> 10:32.897
Well, since I know the
developer personally,

10:32.898 --> 10:34.995
10% gets you in,
the rest you can finance.

10:35.463 --> 10:39.494
- Ten percent?
- Julie, it's a really good investment.

10:39.689 --> 10:41.799
And if you need help with
the down payment...

10:41.800 --> 10:44.545
I'm not destitute, Kirsten.
I'm discerning.

10:45.661 --> 10:49.432
- Should I make a call, set up a walk-through?
- Why not?

10:51.393 --> 10:53.233
Oh. I wonder who that is.

10:59.296 --> 11:01.950
I was on my way to the club, and I thought
you might want to join me for a bite.

11:02.403 --> 11:04.152
Oh, it's good of you to stop by.

11:04.188 --> 11:05.498
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize you had company.

11:05.499 --> 11:09.250
No, no, no. Charlotte, this is Julie.
Julie, this is Charlotte.

11:09.288 --> 11:11.667
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- We met at Suriak.

11:11.735 --> 11:13.929
- Oh, are you a doctor?
- Patient.

11:13.971 --> 11:16.334
You know what? I have an appointment
I have to be getting to, so,

11:16.389 --> 11:18.785
Kirsten, call me when you hear
from your real estate friend.

11:18.802 --> 11:23.759
On my cell. My hotel is
terrible... about messages.

11:23.882 --> 11:25.942
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

11:27.552 --> 11:30.376
Okay, clearly I have got to
learn how to call ahead.

11:30.392 --> 11:32.611
I'm sorry. I hope I didn't scare
your friend away.

11:32.658 --> 11:36.634
Oh, it'd take a lot more than that to
scare Julie. She was married to my dad.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.867
Oh, well, that would explain the
size of the rock on her finger.

11:39.936 --> 11:42.238
Well, he didn't leave her much else.

11:42.448 --> 11:44.117
"Newport Point Condominiums."

11:44.147 --> 11:47.490
It's not the Taj Mahal, but it'll be a good
place for her and her daughter to start over

11:47.543 --> 11:50.081
Can I get you some salad?
We have plenty left.

11:50.115 --> 11:52.296
Oh, yeah, that'd be great.
I'm starving, actually. Thanks.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.775
So, your dad left her with nothing.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.859
She must be feeling
really vulnerable now.

12:03.930 --> 12:06.142
Come on, Coop.
Ryan's going.

12:06.242 --> 12:08.499
Yeah. And I'm sure he'll have a
great time with you and Seth.

12:10.434 --> 12:12.241
Look, it's not because it's Harbor.

12:12.280 --> 12:14.685
And it's not because it's college.
I just have a lot of homework.

12:14.948 --> 12:16.298
Yeah, sure. Homework.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.899
You want me to focus
on my future?

12:17.957 --> 12:20.831
Well, guess what? Tomorrow I have a
trig exam that I'm totally going to fail.

12:23.622 --> 12:26.168
Okay. Sure. I'll just
tell everyone you said hi.

12:28.059 --> 12:31.434
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.

12:38.927 --> 12:42.843
Ivy League, Big 10, Pac 10.

12:42.939 --> 12:46.334
You know, college fairs are kind of like
shopping. It's all about brand recognition.

12:46.392 --> 12:50.038
You know Princeton was originally called
the College of New Jersey?

12:50.115 --> 12:52.070
Hmm. How hard do you think it
would be to get into that school?

12:52.075 --> 12:53.339
Well, why don't you ask them?

12:53.935 --> 12:55.864
Why not, indeed?

12:58.836 --> 13:01.267
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, fine.

13:01.344 --> 13:03.196
Just a little weird being back here.

13:04.257 --> 13:05.568
I feel like a fugitive.

13:06.437 --> 13:08.694
You have as much right
to be here as anyone.

13:09.562 --> 13:12.822
- So, where do you want to start?
- I really don't know.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.638
I hear Berkeley is an excellent choice.

13:15.934 --> 13:20.158
- Very pretty girls, too.
- Oh. And there's the UC sign.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.801
- Sounds good?
- Sure.

13:22.859 --> 13:25.965
- So, all these schools are in the Northeast.
- Yeah. So?

13:26.207 --> 13:29.376
So, just a little something
I like to call "winter".

13:29.602 --> 13:32.691
God, your bony ass can't even
take it when Newport drops to 70.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.178
Oh, my God! Wait.

13:35.743 --> 13:38.418
- What?
- Ooh, busted.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.809
Now do you believe me?
That is totally a couple fight.

13:41.867 --> 13:46.151
Or Dean Hess just told Taylor that her chances
are better at Cornell than Dartmouth.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.824
You still don't believe me.

13:48.289 --> 13:51.975
No, I'm just saying, look, an on-campus
argument in front of the students

13:51.977 --> 13:54.910
and the faculty and parents is not
really proof of a relationship.

13:55.006 --> 13:58.840
- Okay. I'm gonna go get you proof.
- What?

14:02.531 --> 14:06.460
- What are you interested in studying?
- Uh, I'm not totally sure.

14:06.514 --> 14:08.663
Ryan's strong in math and physics.

14:08.752 --> 14:11.251
And he's shown a real aptitude
for building and drafting.

14:11.320 --> 14:12.813
Maybe architecture?

14:12.854 --> 14:14.553
- We've got a great program.
- Maybe.

14:14.607 --> 14:16.509
It's good to see you.

14:21.221 --> 14:22.753
I'll be right back.

14:26.040 --> 14:29.396
What is Atwood doing here?
He's not to set foot on this campus.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.908
I cleared it with Principal Kim.

14:30.937 --> 14:34.528
You can keep him from enrolling here, but you
can't keep him from attending a public event.

14:34.601 --> 14:35.714
I'm calling security.

14:35.729 --> 14:38.100
Unless you have a court-ordered
injunction against my son,

14:38.101 --> 14:40.200
I recommend you keep your hands off him.

14:41.001 --> 14:46.845
Fine. He can stay. But it's a waste of time.
None of these schools will even admit him.

14:46.871 --> 14:48.647
Because of the letter you attached to his file.

14:48.658 --> 14:51.279
Maybe he'll think twice about
assaulting his next victim.

14:51.314 --> 14:55.503
He made a mistake, and he should pay for it.
But should the price really be his future?

14:57.271 --> 15:00.099
You're killing his one shot.

15:03.257 --> 15:06.179
No. He did that all by himself.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.061
Morning, buddy. Got up early,
put on a pot of regular.

15:38.970 --> 15:42.270
Oh, no. Oh, man.

15:44.909 --> 15:49.151
- Ryan! You're... here.
- Where else would I be?

15:50.046 --> 15:52.870
Well, after last night, I thought
you might have gone Greyhound,

15:52.878 --> 15:56.848
but clearly, my concern was
unfounded because you're... fine.

15:56.877 --> 15:59.897
Sure. I mean, no one in my family
even got through high school.

16:00.180 --> 16:02.866
Two years ago, the thought of college
never even crossed my mind.

16:03.576 --> 16:05.236
It was never where I was headed.

16:06.144 --> 16:08.746
Where are you headed right now?
A little, uh, field trip with your tutor?

16:08.793 --> 16:11.519
I canceled the tutor.
If anyone asks, I'm at the library.

16:11.578 --> 16:12.724
Good. I think that's a good idea.

16:12.749 --> 16:15.640
You take a day, clear your head
with a little independent study.

16:15.660 --> 16:19.213
My head is clear.Tutor's not coming
back. I'm done with school.

16:19.861 --> 16:21.480
You're dropping out?

16:23.366 --> 16:25.891
- And then what?
- I don't know yet.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.829
That's a smart move.
Have you told my parents?

16:29.583 --> 16:31.768
Have you told Marissa?
That's fine.

16:31.957 --> 16:34.368
High school-- it's overrated.
I'm sure you'll do fine.

16:35.197 --> 16:38.814
Ryan, you can't just drop out of school.
It's only gonna make things worse.

16:40.773 --> 16:44.842
I got to get to class, okay?
Please, let's just talk after. Bye.

16:45.304 --> 16:47.042
- Everything okay?
- Yeah. Great.

16:47.208 --> 16:49.460
- My boyfriend's quitting school.
- Why?

16:49.499 --> 16:52.391
Because he doesn't think he can get
into college, so he's just giving up.

16:52.691 --> 16:54.896
Seems like a smart kid.
I'm sure he'll be all right.

16:55.812 --> 16:57.092
This time I'm not so sure.

16:57.707 --> 17:00.956
- His family is kind of screwed up.
- Whose isn't?

17:01.006 --> 17:03.524
Okay, true, but Ryan's
is really screwed up.

17:03.929 --> 17:06.393
And he's got a chance to be different
than them if he'd just take it.

17:06.472 --> 17:07.855
Have you told him that?

17:07.931 --> 17:11.260
Oh, I don't think he'll listen to me.
In fact, I don't know who he'll listen to.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.534
Miss Morgan.

17:20.521 --> 17:23.663
No. Julie Cooper-Nichol.

17:24.282 --> 17:26.970
Oh, right. Kirsten Cohen's referral.

17:27.019 --> 17:29.086
Door's open, so I thought I'd take
a little peek around.

17:29.155 --> 17:32.780
Gave me a chance to really
visualize myself in place

17:33.284 --> 17:34.341
I'll take it.

17:35.067 --> 17:37.072
- Beg your pardon?
- I brought the down payment with me.

17:37.102 --> 17:39.284
I'm assuming cash is okay?

17:40.894 --> 17:42.435
- Ms. Cooper...
- Cooper-Nichol.

17:42.504 --> 17:45.938
I think we may have a little misunderstanding.
You see, when we spoke this morning,

17:45.950 --> 17:48.821
I was under the impression that
this unit wasn't, um...

17:49.414 --> 17:50.688
right for you.

17:50.838 --> 17:52.988
- I beg your pardon.
- This is a four-bedroom.

17:53.043 --> 17:56.514
The one that we talked about
is a two-bedroom in the garden.

17:56.681 --> 18:00.216
Garden. Realtor-speak
for basement, right?

18:00.311 --> 18:03.205
- Hello.
- Ah. You must be Ms. Morgan.

18:04.669 --> 18:06.440
Julie, right?

18:06.763 --> 18:10.293
- Hi! What are you doing here?
- I might ask the same thing.

18:10.325 --> 18:12.181
Well, I'm planning on doing some
business in the area,

18:12.184 --> 18:14.466
and I heard this condo might be
a perfect little crash pad,

18:14.495 --> 18:16.115
but it looks like you beat me to it.

18:16.308 --> 18:18.050
Actually, your timing is perfect.

18:18.055 --> 18:21.030
I'm sorry. I think I'm looking for
something with a better view.

18:21.045 --> 18:22.987
Charlotte, the place is all yours.

18:25.138 --> 18:29.077
Well, follow me, Miss Morgan.
We'll start with the master.

18:45.274 --> 18:46.311
Where you been?

18:46.390 --> 18:48.519
- I've been lookingfor you all day.
- I've been avoiding you.

18:48.626 --> 18:53.018
Just because I don't buy into your whole
Taylor and the Dean forbidden love delusion?

18:53.477 --> 18:56.035
Yeah. Could we table that for a second?
We have a bigger problem to worry about.

18:56.282 --> 18:59.009
Ryan quitting school?
I know. Marissa told me.

18:59.202 --> 19:01.167
Well, I think we should do
something before it's too late.

19:01.237 --> 19:02.491
Why do you think I'm writing this letter?

19:02.508 --> 19:04.324
You starting a petition?
That's a pretty good idea.

19:04.340 --> 19:07.485
No, it's not a petition, dumb-ass.
I'm begging for Taylor's forgiveness.

19:07.583 --> 19:10.514
Hmm. You had me and then you...
I think you lost me.

19:11.628 --> 19:14.911
Okay, if Taylor thinks that Dean Hess
is sorry, maybe they'll get back together.

19:14.942 --> 19:18.710
And then we can expose them and use that
as leverage to get Ryan back in school.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.395
No, no. I understand.

19:25.358 --> 19:28.784
Can I call you right back?
Thanks.

19:33.197 --> 19:35.358
- What's going on?
- That was Ryan's tutor

19:35.952 --> 19:37.927
- calling for her final paycheck.
- What?!

19:38.035 --> 19:40.999
Ryan told her that he would no
longer be needing her services

19:41.000 --> 19:42.995
since he won't be finishing high school.

19:43.421 --> 19:45.952
- Where's Ryan now?
- Marissa said he was at the library.

19:46.090 --> 19:48.600
Well, one kid dropping out of
school, the other kid lying.

19:49.000 --> 19:50.842
And I thought that he was gonna be boring.

20:05.828 --> 20:07.264
Hey, man.

20:08.773 --> 20:10.078
Hey, Johnny.

20:10.180 --> 20:13.420
Marissa said they had the best burgers in
town. Figured I should check it out for myself.

20:13.490 --> 20:14.892
Yeah, come on in.

20:18.760 --> 20:20.612
So, she told you what's going on.

20:22.281 --> 20:25.612
- Might have mentioned it.
- Well, no offense, but you barely know me.

20:26.229 --> 20:28.698
Which is why I'm not here
to talk you into anything.

20:29.146 --> 20:30.720
I mean, I'm not going to college.

20:31.013 --> 20:33.697
Figured I'd do all right in a few
surf competitions next year.

20:33.707 --> 20:35.395
Maybe hook up with some sponsors.

20:35.566 --> 20:38.976
Turn that into a career, you know?
It's a simple plan, but...

20:40.128 --> 20:44.634
Better than what I got. Thought I'd get a job,
figure things out after I make a little money.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.245
- What kind of job are you looking for?
- Did construction last summer.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.282
The hours were long, but I like the work.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.912
My uncle has this commercial
fishing operation.

20:55.180 --> 20:57.086
He's always looking for new guys.

20:57.402 --> 20:59.546
Well, it's kind of brutal,
but you can't beat the pay.

20:59.794 --> 21:02.726
- Think he'd give me a shot?
- If you want, I'll take you down there.

21:23.082 --> 21:26.616
He could be off joining a foreign
legion. Joining a cult.

21:28.418 --> 21:30.828
Ryan could be... I don't know.

21:30.867 --> 21:33.000
He could be taking part in
a mass marriage right now,

21:33.001 --> 21:35.200
drinking Kool-Aid from
brand-new sneakers.

21:36.291 --> 21:39.764
- So many sick things.
- I'm gonna try his cell again.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.948
Dude, where were you?
We were about to sound an Amber Alert.

21:47.961 --> 21:48.719
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:48.727 --> 21:50.895
Look, I know you've had a rough 24 hours,

21:50.905 --> 21:54.134
and I am a firm believer that every
man deserves his space.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.273
- You can't go off like that.
- Won't happen again.

21:56.397 --> 21:59.375
Listen, lucky for you, I was able to do
a little damage control with your tutor.

21:59.838 --> 22:02.199
She's agreed to come this weekend
and make up for what you missed today.

22:02.357 --> 22:06.647
- Well,I appreciate that, but, um...
- What's this?

22:08.376 --> 22:12.820
It's a guardian release form.
I got a job. On a boat.

22:14.039 --> 22:17.419
You mean like a cruise ship? 'Cause you
don't really seem like the type.

22:17.681 --> 22:19.178
This is a joke, right?

22:20.027 --> 22:24.686
These boats go out for weeks at a time.
You're not of age.

22:24.706 --> 22:27.358
- That's why I need your signature.
- So, you want to throw away your future

22:27.362 --> 22:28.817
so you can go work on a fishing boat?

22:28.876 --> 22:32.030
Come on. My future's already trashed.
Tried it your way. It didn't work.

22:32.069 --> 22:34.174
- You have to keep trying.
- No, I don't.

22:37.087 --> 22:38.573
I have been trying.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.657
And I appreciate everything
you've done for me. I really do,.

22:42.785 --> 22:45.017
but I need to make my own decisions

22:47.628 --> 22:49.981
And I am asking you to let me go.

23:02.874 --> 23:04.516
- Sandy.
- Dad.

23:19.419 --> 23:24.021
Come up here and help George with the deck.
Check the icemaker, put some Freon in there.

23:24.025 --> 23:27.434
We lose any of the next haul,
it's coming out of your paychecks.

23:27.497 --> 23:28.980
- Mr. Harper?
- Yeah?

23:29.066 --> 23:31.154
Uh, Ryan Atwood from yesterday.

23:32.217 --> 23:34.910
Oh, yeah, Charlie's friend, right?
Hold this

23:35.473 --> 23:38.661
Look, kid... we don't need any
part-time help right now.

23:38.827 --> 23:40.709
- Come back next summer.
- Give me a needle, somebody!

23:40.772 --> 23:44.378
Yeah, about that, I got the signature.
I can do it full-time.

23:47.047 --> 23:50.889
You know, this isn't putting bait on hooks.
It's hard work.

23:51.005 --> 23:53.765
You mess up out there, you
don't get fired, you get hurt.

23:54.094 --> 23:57.153
I work construction; I can handle it.
I'd really appreciate the chance.

23:57.202 --> 23:59.390
Yeah, that's because
you don't know better.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.022
All right. Yeah, we got a spot open on
the Gail; we're prepping her right now.

24:04.196 --> 24:06.784
- Oh, great. How long she gonna be out?
- Depends on the action.

24:06.991 --> 24:10.546
I guess about three weeks. She
shoves off tomorrow, sunset.

24:10.606 --> 24:12.992
- You got a problem with that?
- No, sir.

24:13.110 --> 24:16.725
- Just, got some loose ends to tie up.
- Yeah, don't we all

24:17.120 --> 24:18.839
All right, don't be late.

24:24.238 --> 24:26.450
- How was surfing?
- Pretty calm.

24:26.509 --> 24:28.356
Had time to do some soul-searching.

24:29.196 --> 24:31.803
- You gonna talk to him?
- I'm sticking with our plan.

24:32.459 --> 24:34.632
Your plan, Sandy.

24:34.802 --> 24:37.851
He's leaving on a boat tomorrow.
This is the wrong time to be stubborn.

24:37.939 --> 24:40.399
Honey, I'm stubborn all the time.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.572
We can't force Ryan
to make the right choice.

24:42.769 --> 24:45.307
Yeah, but we can stop him from
making a horrible mistake,

24:45.337 --> 24:47.816
from permanently knocking
his life off course.

24:47.869 --> 24:49.578
Yeah, it's a course we set for him.

24:50.744 --> 24:52.229
Would you let Seth do this?

24:53.993 --> 24:57.460
- We kind of did.
- No, no, that was different: it was summer

24:57.560 --> 25:00.058
He didn't miss school.
And it was Seth: we knew he'd come back.

25:01.312 --> 25:03.569
You know, in Ryan's position at his age,

25:03.588 --> 25:06.610
I can't say I wouldn't be doing the
same thing. I left home at 17.

25:06.641 --> 25:08.664
Yeah, to start your life,
not throw it away.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.774
Ryan doesn't want this.
He'll come around, but...

25:12.621 --> 25:15.377
- we got to let him get there on his own.
- And what if he doesn't?

25:16.355 --> 25:17.984
- Hey.
- Hi, sweetie.

25:18.079 --> 25:20.341
Have you guys seen Ryan?
He hasn't been returning my calls.

25:20.403 --> 25:21.535
Oh, he should be home soon.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.693
This thing with the dean
has really gotten to him.

25:23.753 --> 25:26.656
I think the best thing we can do
is support him, no matter what.

25:26.729 --> 25:30.880
- So you want to throw him a going-away dinner?
- That's not a bad idea.

25:31.080 --> 25:32.222
Wait. Where's he going?

25:36.975 --> 25:40.571
"You are like a warm breeze
blowing down Van Nuys Boulevard."

25:40.878 --> 25:43.671
"From Encino to Reseda,
there is nothing as beautiful as you."

25:44.041 --> 25:47.143
- "Your eyes are as blue as a smogless day..."
- What the hell is that?

25:47.621 --> 25:50.091
Well, I lifted it from
the season finale of The Valley.

25:50.291 --> 25:52.335
You know, when Manuel was
busting a move on April,

25:52.365 --> 25:54.231
and she found out Jake was
sleeping with her mom.

25:54.288 --> 25:57.158
- Right, that was riveting stuff.
- Yeah. Will you proof it for me?

25:57.209 --> 25:58.471
Listen, we have to act fast.

25:58.478 --> 26:02.490
Ryan's about a yellow slicker and a graveyard
away from becoming the Gorton's fisherman.

26:02.806 --> 26:05.091
- Yeah, not getting the reference
- He got a job on a fishing boat.

26:05.103 --> 26:06.592
- Leaves tomorrow night.
- Wait, what?

26:06.641 --> 26:09.357
Are you serious?
Your dad's just, like, letting him go?

26:09.419 --> 26:11.782
Pulling the old Sandy Cohen
Jedi mind-meld on him.

26:11.940 --> 26:14.599
-Trying to break his will by agreeing with him.
-Oh, like he did with you?

26:14.612 --> 26:16.921
Which you fell for, because you
were both spineless and weak.

26:16.951 --> 26:19.237
Yes, exactly, but this is Ryan
we're talking about.

26:19.282 --> 26:23.082
So if Taylor's gonna fall for your plan, we
need to speak in a language she'll understand.

26:23.124 --> 26:27.808
- Are you trying to say that you believe me?
- No, not exactly, there's just no other options.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.227
Do you have her cell phone number?

26:29.366 --> 26:31.952
What? We're not gonna call her.
She's not a moron. She's just evil.

26:31.974 --> 26:35.017
We're not gonna call her, my little dim sum.
We're going to text her.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.255
- What is that?
- Or should I say Dean Hess is.

26:37.289 --> 26:39.343
You got the bedazzled one-- pink, too?!

26:39.926 --> 26:42.721
But we can't text her an apology...
wait, we're texting her an apology?

26:43.144 --> 26:45.589
An invitation. I got a room
at the Mermaid Motel.

26:45.700 --> 26:48.460
You mean the place where Ryan may
or may not have conceived Theresa's baby,

26:48.471 --> 26:50.749
and where Marissa's mom
and Luke got it on?

26:50.774 --> 26:52.416
Newport's very own den of sin.

26:52.909 --> 26:54.954
Ew. But I like it.

26:55.185 --> 26:57.269
We can even... I mean,
if we have some free time.

26:58.523 --> 26:59.622
Whatever.

27:06.586 --> 27:09.033
Hope you don't mind.
I'm early for your going-away party.

27:09.068 --> 27:09.813
My what?

27:09.827 --> 27:14.466
Sandy and Kirsten want to have a send-off
party for you, since, apparently, you're leaving.

27:15.315 --> 27:17.337
- I was gonna tell you.
- It slipped your mind?

27:17.522 --> 27:22.290
No. I was waiting for the right time.

27:22.807 --> 27:25.616
Since I thought you might
not understand.

27:26.033 --> 27:28.707
Understand what?
That you're becoming a fisherman?

27:28.721 --> 27:29.753
It's not about the job.

27:32.831 --> 27:35.470
- I need to make a change.
- A change.

27:35.640 --> 27:36.931
Not from us.

27:36.933 --> 27:39.688
Right, because you going away for weeks
at a time won't change us at all.

27:39.690 --> 27:41.432
It's not forever.

27:43.290 --> 27:45.413
- It's just until...
- Until when?

27:45.495 --> 27:48.316
The dean lets you back into Harbor
'cause that may never happen.

27:48.872 --> 27:51.353
- I need you to understand.
- Consider it understood.

27:56.683 --> 27:58.202
You sure about this Julie Cooper?

27:58.535 --> 28:01.535
Definitely. She's got all the right
connections and nothing left to lose.

28:01.849 --> 28:05.022
- I hope so. You better be right.
- I know what I'm doing, babe.

28:27.049 --> 28:28.416
What the hell are you doing here?

28:28.564 --> 28:31.181
Hope you don't mind me tracking you down--
I got your address from the Realtor.

28:31.302 --> 28:34.771
- Are you stalking me?
- No, but I can see why you'd think that.

28:35.320 --> 28:38.673
- Can I come in?
- Uh, you really don't want to, and no.

28:39.728 --> 28:41.655
Okay, well, I have some good news.

28:41.860 --> 28:44.095
- I got the condo.
- Oh, well, I'm happy for you.

28:44.379 --> 28:46.477
- Adios.
- I put it in your name.

28:48.132 --> 28:51.181
- Say what now?
- I bought it for you.

28:51.737 --> 28:53.231
You bought me a condo?

28:54.035 --> 28:57.080
Kirsten... filled me in
on your situation.

28:58.828 --> 29:00.878
- It moved me.
- It moved me, too...

29:01.149 --> 29:02.957
right into this fleabag hellhole.

29:03.590 --> 29:08.843
onetheless, a long time ago, I learned there
is no such thing as a free lunch... or a condo.

29:08.930 --> 29:11.304
Julie, I don't want anything from you.
I swear.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.300
Except the use of the
spare room when I'm in town,

29:13.301 --> 29:15.000
which would only be a couple weeks a year.

29:15.900 --> 29:17.806
Other than that, it's all yours.

29:19.532 --> 29:20.964
You're serious?

29:21.154 --> 29:23.826
Look, I know what it's like
to fall on hard times.

29:25.627 --> 29:29.012
No one else has to know about our
arrangement. This can just be our secret.

29:34.662 --> 29:38.491
You realize, Ryan, of all our harebrained
schemes, of which there are many,

29:38.933 --> 29:42.346
quitting school for a life
at sea-- that may be #1.

29:42.739 --> 29:45.709
Can't say the idea has gotten
an enthusiastic response,

29:45.837 --> 29:47.881
except from your dad,
who's throwing me a dinner.

29:48.030 --> 29:49.798
- He's calling your bluff.
- I'm not bluffing.

29:49.870 --> 29:50.992
I didn't say it was working.

29:51.051 --> 29:54.182
I think he's just hoping to give
me enough rope to hang myself.

29:54.244 --> 29:57.534
And instead, you fashion said rope
into a perfect little sailor's knot.

29:58.176 --> 30:00.114
Well... it's the best option I got.

30:00.453 --> 30:02.869
What if Harbor let you back in,
that change your mind?

30:02.942 --> 30:04.748
- Never gonna happen.
- Never say never.

30:04.866 --> 30:06.328
I may have a plan in motion.

30:06.397 --> 30:09.332
Mm. I feel a lot better.
Let's just get this over with.

30:10.007 --> 30:12.144
Let's just get this over with.

30:12.220 --> 30:16.321
We got dressed up, and you decided to come to
this thing. Might as well make the best of it.

30:16.420 --> 30:18.050
- How am I supposed to do that?
- I don't know,

30:18.156 --> 30:21.586
but you know what?The same time tomorrow,
Atwood is gonna be off the Pacific

30:21.600 --> 30:24.147
ridgenetting sea bass with rank
fishermen in wool sweaters.

30:24.263 --> 30:27.436
Yeah, well, you are right. This could be
the last time I see him for a while.

30:27.527 --> 30:28.963
Where he doesn't smell
like pickled herring.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.625
All right, I'll try.

30:51.395 --> 30:52.425
Honey...

30:53.186 --> 30:55.328
this homemade pad thai-- it-it's delicious.

30:55.387 --> 30:57.501
You keep this up, we're going
to save a bundle on takeout.

30:57.542 --> 31:01.763
Well, thank you. I hope everybody
likes it. I used tofu instead of shrimp.

31:01.951 --> 31:05.151
It's fine by me. I think I've kind of
gone off of seafood for a while.

31:08.638 --> 31:10.524
I, for one, I love the tofu.

31:10.895 --> 31:16.050
Tofuna, tofurkey...
tobagel... with cream tocheese.

31:18.806 --> 31:20.939
Too much.
It was a valiant effort.

31:25.612 --> 31:27.617
So, tell us about the captain.

31:27.903 --> 31:31.241
Uh... well, he's pretty much
what you'd expect.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.654
Oh, what's that? Eye patch, peg leg...

31:33.967 --> 31:35.308
parrot on his shoulder?

31:38.407 --> 31:40.221
I love parrots.
I think they're cute.

31:40.901 --> 31:43.012
You know...
"Polly want a cracker."

31:45.674 --> 31:47.001
Yeah. Sorry.

31:52.291 --> 31:54.955
Actually, uh, the captain's Johnny's uncle.
That's how I met him.

31:55.182 --> 31:56.370
Johnny got you the job?

31:58.049 --> 31:59.345
Unbelievable.

32:00.507 --> 32:04.334
You know what? I think I'm just ruining
everyone's dinner, so I'm going to go.

32:04.896 --> 32:06.921
No, no, no, sit down.
You're not ruining anything.

32:07.921 --> 32:10.871
Well, maybe a little... but
it's completely understandable.

32:11.044 --> 32:13.107
Well, I'm glad something around here is.

32:13.699 --> 32:15.092
Summer, can I have the keys?

32:17.579 --> 32:21.799
- Thanks for dinner, Sandy, Kirsten.
- Excuse me.

32:26.356 --> 32:28.599
Summer, your purse is buzzing.

32:34.376 --> 32:35.838
Taylor took the bait.

32:35.937 --> 32:37.932
Marissa, come on, hey, wait.
Can we talk about this?

32:38.687 --> 32:41.551
What's there to talk about?
You've already made your decision.

32:42.485 --> 32:45.138
I don't want to leave like this.
Then don't leave.

32:48.601 --> 32:51.051
All right, well, then,
I guess we don't have a choice.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.384
- Need any help?
- Ah, I'm good. Thanks.

33:01.434 --> 33:03.185
At this point, I'm pretty
good at packing light.

33:03.339 --> 33:04.941
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

33:06.116 --> 33:08.166
Well, you've beaten
the Sandy Cohen mind-meld.

33:08.309 --> 33:10.021
I was hoping if we gave you
the space you need,

33:10.026 --> 33:12.283
you'd realize that this is not
the answer to your problem.

33:12.358 --> 33:14.595
Maybe my problem doesn't have an answer.

33:14.604 --> 33:17.456
Sure it does, Ryan. If you keep out
of trouble until you graduate,

33:17.464 --> 33:19.537
at the very least, you'll land at
a good community college.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.936
Yeah. You post a couple
of semesters of good work

33:22.236 --> 33:23.858
and you can transfer
to a four-year school.

33:24.041 --> 33:26.673
Yeah... you come from
my family, it's not so easy.

33:27.138 --> 33:28.508
We're your family now.

33:30.422 --> 33:33.298
I may not be an Atwood anymore,
but I'm not a Cohen, either.

33:35.085 --> 33:36.435
I don't know what I am.

33:38.511 --> 33:40.325
So you're going to figure it
out lost at sea?

33:40.633 --> 33:42.948
Eh, lost at sea, lost on land.
What's the difference, right?

33:44.646 --> 33:47.732
Look, kid, we can't force you to stay,

33:48.658 --> 33:51.918
but this is your home now,
and the door is always open.

33:52.381 --> 33:55.921
Thank you. I'm going to head out.
See you in a couple weeks.

34:18.512 --> 34:19.916
Marissa, hey, what's going on?

34:19.991 --> 34:22.444
Hey, I wanted to talk to you
about that job you got Ryan.

34:22.523 --> 34:24.835
- I'm glad I could help.
- How, by ruining his life?

34:26.400 --> 34:30.420
I'm going to go... out into
the ocean... far away.

34:32.210 --> 34:34.621
I'm a little confused. I mean...

34:34.743 --> 34:39.228
Ryan needed a job. I got him one.
Thought I was helping him out.

34:39.922 --> 34:45.989
I know. I shouldn't be blaming you. It was
his decision. It's just now he's leaving.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.797
I take it it wasn't a happy sendoff.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.945
We got in a fight.

34:52.697 --> 34:57.265
Well...at least you got to be honest
with him, tell him how you felt.

34:57.722 --> 34:59.738
Actually, I didn't.

35:01.442 --> 35:05.022
- And now I don't even know where he is.
- I do.

35:07.846 --> 35:09.447
Home sweet home.

35:11.745 --> 35:14.301
Gift horse mouth, far be it
from me to do any looking.

35:14.366 --> 35:16.211
I don't know what to say.
Thank you.

35:16.216 --> 35:18.784
You don't have to say anything. It makes
me feel great just to be able to help,

35:19.006 --> 35:20.620
although this place does
need some furniture.

35:20.813 --> 35:22.817
I think I can cover that.
I have a little money stashed away.

35:22.933 --> 35:25.209
Mm, so pawning that ring
brought in a small fortune.

35:26.491 --> 35:29.679
- How about a little champagne?
- Aren't you just out of rehab?

35:30.321 --> 35:32.001
All right, for you,
I'll have water.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.705
I will open this. I'll meet you out there.
If you can find some glasses...

35:35.710 --> 35:37.020
My pleasure.

35:49.410 --> 35:50.906
She's in.

36:10.862 --> 36:13.058
Marissa.
What are you doing here?

36:13.396 --> 36:16.099
I couldn't let you leave without
telling you how I really felt.

36:17.716 --> 36:21.649
You see, I couldn't figure out why I
was so mad at you, and then I realized

36:22.108 --> 36:23.942
it's because you're doing what my dad did.

36:24.024 --> 36:26.580
You see, he left and ran away
on a boat, and now you are too,

36:26.592 --> 36:30.268
so I guess that makes you just
as much of a coward as he is.

36:32.759 --> 36:35.653
And you know what? Running away
never really helped him at all.

36:50.907 --> 36:54.101
What if this is the bed that
Julie and Luke had sex in?

36:54.220 --> 36:55.561
A boy can dream.

36:55.772 --> 36:58.636
- Will you quit peeping out the window, Cohen?
- You don't peep out of windows.

36:58.937 --> 37:00.987
- You peep into 'em.
- Oh, you'd know.

37:04.401 --> 37:06.210
Taylor. She's coming.

37:09.412 --> 37:10.806
Hey, skank.

37:11.221 --> 37:14.930
You were expecting someone taller,
blonder, with a pageboy haircut?

37:14.999 --> 37:17.893
Welcome to the Terror Dome, Townsend.
You're busted.

37:18.550 --> 37:20.051
For what, exactly?

37:20.742 --> 37:23.132
Hmm, a little extracurricular
activity with Dean Hess.

37:23.696 --> 37:25.819
Yeah. I saw you two making
out at the dance.

37:26.728 --> 37:28.101
So what if we did?

37:30.543 --> 37:32.583
She'd make a hell of a poker player.
I mean, she's pretty good.

37:32.686 --> 37:34.754
Yeah, unless you and the dean
want this little thingamajig...

37:34.785 --> 37:36.652
- Heinous...
- ...to go public...

37:36.664 --> 37:38.523
- What up?
- We have a few demands.

37:38.769 --> 37:40.024
- Don't we?
- Yeah.

37:40.329 --> 37:43.411
Starting with the lifting of the
ban of Ryan Atwood from Harbor.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.415
You can go ahead and
tell anyone you want.

37:45.564 --> 37:48.112
No one's going to believe you.

37:49.572 --> 37:50.964
She's like a block of ice.

37:51.001 --> 37:55.008
You willing to bet your squeaky little
reputation on that, Taylor Trash? Hmm?

37:55.399 --> 37:59.471
'Cause I have got a huge mouth
and an even bigger buddy list.

38:00.587 --> 38:04.781
See this right here? Sidekick.
Walkie-talkie of the 21st century.

38:04.975 --> 38:06.938
- Who should we radio first?
- How about my dad?

38:06.951 --> 38:08.385
Yeah, 10-4, good buddy.

38:08.533 --> 38:09.630
So what's it going to be?

38:09.778 --> 38:13.481
You can either tell Seth's dad the perverted
truth and save your sorry ass,

38:13.550 --> 38:17.323
or you can roll the dice.
Over and out.

38:30.422 --> 38:31.911
Sandy, come on in.

38:32.487 --> 38:34.113
Thanks for meeting me on a Sunday.

38:34.363 --> 38:37.719
I take it from the surreptitious
nature of your phone call,

38:37.722 --> 38:40.072
you have something serious to discuss.

38:40.101 --> 38:42.758
Surreptitious. Good word.
No wonder they made you dean.

38:43.701 --> 38:47.944
I don't know. Do you classify a surreptitious
student-teacher relationship as serious?

38:49.898 --> 38:54.135
If you're here to make an accusation,
Sandy, then please, feel free.

38:54.233 --> 38:57.298
It's just the two of us.
We can talk. Man to man.

38:58.342 --> 39:02.668
why talk when a picture's worth a
thousand words or a hefty lawsuit?

39:04.169 --> 39:05.809
Sorry, I'm not...following.

39:07.406 --> 39:09.944
Technology's a bitch... Dean.

39:10.991 --> 39:12.650
I have a hard time keeping up with it.

39:12.769 --> 39:15.287
This little puppy is a phone
that surfs the Web

39:15.376 --> 39:19.277
and, unfortunately for you,
it transmits photos.

39:19.735 --> 39:22.984
Hard to send a picture of something
that never happened.

39:23.122 --> 39:26.154
So you're saying you didn't get too close
to a coed at the school dance.

39:28.594 --> 39:30.490
And these photos I have are fakes?

39:34.415 --> 39:35.976
She's an aggressive girl.

39:36.450 --> 39:40.687
She had a schoolgirl crush, and at
the dance, she forced herself on me.

39:41.482 --> 39:43.270
I mean, it was just a kiss.

39:43.339 --> 39:45.902
Well, I don't think the Board of Trustees
will see this as just a kiss.

39:45.949 --> 39:47.538
Plus, that's not what
the girl is saying.

39:49.057 --> 39:51.961
- You talked to her?
- Yep. She told me everything.

39:52.414 --> 39:54.686
She doesn't want this to get out,
and I assume you don't, either,

39:54.755 --> 39:57.199
'cause a scandal like this
could be a real career-killer,

39:57.200 --> 39:59.000
and you seem to be an ambitious guy.

40:02.387 --> 40:04.589
What do you want, Sandy?

40:04.728 --> 40:09.537
You kicked Ryan out of this school. I want
you to let him back in...with a clean slate.

40:12.090 --> 40:14.120
I suggest you get yourself one of these,

40:14.229 --> 40:18.011
get on Craig's List, and find yourself
another position on the East Coast.

40:18.480 --> 40:19.873
Sound good to you?

40:51.937 --> 40:54.682
- Coop, are you okay?
- Ryan left.

40:55.334 --> 40:56.314
He's gone?

40:56.350 --> 40:59.616
Wait, what? We just pulled off,
like, a life-changing scam.

40:59.626 --> 41:00.989
Are you telling me we're too late?

41:01.240 --> 41:03.887
- What are you talking about?
- Well, it doesn't matter now.

41:07.478 --> 41:08.604
Well, this sucks.

41:14.200 --> 41:16.936
Hey, it's the return of the
not-so-ancient mariner.

41:23.942 --> 41:25.028
Look...

41:26.332 --> 41:30.826
I don't know what my future is,
but I know...

41:31.043 --> 41:33.759
it's with you...
here...

41:35.385 --> 41:37.489
not on some boat in the middle of the ocean.

41:45.732 --> 41:49.011
I got good news for you. Well, I have...
I have good news and I have some bad news.

41:49.179 --> 41:52.216
- What's the good news?
- The good news is you're back at Harbor.

41:52.633 --> 41:53.551
Really?

41:53.561 --> 41:55.901
Yeah. My dad bluffed the dean,
and he caved on all counts.

41:55.940 --> 41:56.938
And the bad news?

41:56.971 --> 42:00.122
Well, eh...
you're back at Harbor, so...

42:02.580 --> 42:03.696
And, uh...

42:06.837 --> 42:08.763
Oh, you know what?
Don't worry about it.

42:09.049 --> 42:11.499
My getting kicked out was backed
up by the whole community.

42:11.562 --> 42:12.895
With you, it was just the dean.

42:13.231 --> 42:15.990
Besides, public school isn't that bad.
This is good news.

42:16.007 --> 42:17.041
- I think so.
- Yeah.

42:17.057 --> 42:19.931
She's right. You know, we got to
take our victories as they come.

42:24.481 --> 42:28.181
I have to say, Ryan Atwood, fisherman--
I think that's a good shape for you.

42:28.221 --> 42:29.196
Yeah, you like that?

42:29.212 --> 42:32.387
I came up with some other pitches for jobs
for you, but I should warn you, they're...

42:33.081 --> 42:34.892
- ...pretty wacky.
- Okay. All right.

42:35.125 --> 42:36.587
Ryan Atwood, bullfighter.

42:36.632 --> 42:39.710
Big hat, like, tight pants,
and a little red coat.

42:39.720 --> 42:42.316
- Hey, but I don't speak Spanish.
- Neither do bulls.

42:42.512 --> 42:44.457
Ryan Atwood, bounty hunter.

42:44.459 --> 42:48.641
Then you could have, like, a crossbow and
a badge and steel-toe boots. You like those.

42:48.663 --> 42:50.394
Or I could be Ryan Atwood, coward?

42:50.458 --> 42:52.583
- Oh, that may havebeen a little harsh.
- You think so?

42:52.599 --> 42:53.718
It got your attention.

42:53.728 --> 42:55.703
Ryan Atwood, fluffer.

42:55.861 --> 42:57.540
- Fluffer? Fluffer?
- Of what?

42:58.087 --> 43:00.000
- What's that?
- We'll explain it later.

43:01.305 --> 43:07.198
