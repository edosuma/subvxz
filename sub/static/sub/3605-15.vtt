16:18.603 --> 16:21.561
because I believe
my next witness is here.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.481
CLAIRE:
Just tell me where she is.

16:29.239 --> 16:33.107
Claire Bennet,
you've been holding
out on me.

16:33.243 --> 16:35.108
What are you talking about?

16:36.246 --> 16:38.658
Why I was supposed
to find you.
You and l are the same.

16:38.748 --> 16:40.739
lam nothing like you.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.950
You do exactly what I do.

16:43.920 --> 16:49.916
You use this gift,
this curse, whatever it is,
to build walls,

16:50.635 --> 16:54.469
make it impossible
to actually connect
with another person.

16:55.849 --> 16:57.430
Like Gretchen.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.007
(EXCLAlMlNG)

16:59.102 --> 17:02.060
All those memory hits
I got from your stuff
while I was tying her up

17:02.147 --> 17:03.387
have such
a different context now.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.769
Everything in that room
is so full of

17:08.111 --> 17:09.521
pauses.

17:09.654 --> 17:11.360
What did you say?

17:11.990 --> 17:17.451
Pauses.
All these moments
so ripe with subtext.

17:19.289 --> 17:21.371
"Can I borrow your book?"

17:23.001 --> 17:25.538
"Cut my hand
with these scissors."

17:27.130 --> 17:29.166
All these interactions,

17:29.299 --> 17:34.009
and you still can't say
the one thing you really
want to say to this girl.

17:34.804 --> 17:35.964
Heck,

17:36.681 --> 17:39.593
you keep this up,
you might end up
alone forever, too.

17:39.684 --> 17:42.221
You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.969
I think I do.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.809
The indestructible girl

17:50.237 --> 17:51.647
(CHUCKLES)

17:53.031 --> 17:55.864
What? No angry retort?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.321
(SCREAMING)

18:00.080 --> 18:02.321
You're right.
You are off your game.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.827
You just told me
exactly where she is.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.211
How many people
have I killed?

18:15.262 --> 18:16.968
Hundreds, I suppose.

18:17.097 --> 18:20.555
And all of this because
of an agreement you made
with the defendant?

18:20.642 --> 18:23.304
Yep. He told me
if I saved the waitress,

18:23.395 --> 18:26.307
I could have the cheerleader
and anybody else
I wanted to kill.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.764
KENSEI: And as long as
you saved his girlfriend,

18:28.858 --> 18:31.270
you could kill
some more.
Willy-nilly.

18:31.361 --> 18:32.441
Willy-nilly.

18:32.529 --> 18:35.441
Seems to me that
a lot of people were hurt

18:35.532 --> 18:38.023
as a result of
Mr. Nakamura's
time-tampering.

18:38.201 --> 18:39.190
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

18:50.463 --> 18:53.250
Really? Does this
look right to you?

18:54.551 --> 18:57.543
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

19:01.016 --> 19:06.181
Tell me again, who else met
their death by your hand
after Hiro made this deal?

19:06.271 --> 19:09.479
Well, there was her.
And Eden-ish.

19:09.566 --> 19:13.900
Two Primatech guards.
The melty guy.
The mechanic.

19:13.987 --> 19:18.526
lsaac Mendez. My mother.
Some guy named Ted something.

19:18.616 --> 19:23.906
And so on, and so on.
If Hiro was acting
out of nobility,

19:23.997 --> 19:26.613
perhaps he should
have stopped
this vicious killer

19:26.708 --> 19:28.198
before these
countless murders...

19:28.293 --> 19:30.830
Sprague. Ted Sprague.

19:30.920 --> 19:34.287
See, saving Charlie wasn't
for the heroic good,

19:35.050 --> 19:37.132
it was for
the good of Hiro.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.631
No. Romantic or not,
Charlie was a good person.

19:40.930 --> 19:43.922
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

19:53.401 --> 19:54.390
KENSEI: Fair enough.

19:54.486 --> 19:57.944
Then the prosecution
would like to call
its final witness.

19:58.323 --> 19:59.938
Charlie Andrews.

20:04.996 --> 20:08.033
That's right.
I forgot. We can't
bring Charlie in

20:08.124 --> 20:12.083
because this
world-improving person
is lost in time.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.331
Now tell me,
how did that happen,
again?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.454
I made a deal with the...

20:16.549 --> 20:18.881
I'm sorry,
you have to speak up.

20:19.803 --> 20:23.341
I made a deal with
a villain, and he
double-crossed me.

20:25.016 --> 20:26.256
Right.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.352
The prosecution rests,
Your Honor.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.319
SAMUEL: A shake roof,
wrap-around porch

20:40.407 --> 20:46.118
and a stone path leading
to a lake where the sun
glistens over the water.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.410
How'd you remember
all of that?

20:47.497 --> 20:48.782
l have my ways.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.619
I know all the details.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.745
By heart, it would seem.

20:53.837 --> 20:55.452
Hard to forget.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.043
l was holding
you close to me.

21:00.135 --> 21:01.875
And the way
you painted it

21:02.804 --> 21:04.010
(SIGHING)

21:04.097 --> 21:07.635
made it so real,
like it came
from your soul.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.595
Like it was you.

21:09.727 --> 21:12.594
You always know
the right thing to say.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.523
You have the perfect
scrap of poetry
in your pocket to...

21:16.609 --> 21:17.894
To what?

21:18.903 --> 21:20.939
(SIGHING)

21:25.910 --> 21:29.744
The big oak tree
in the yard surrounded
by wildflowers.

21:29.831 --> 21:33.915
And a couple of
rocking chairs on the deck
to watch the sunset.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.083
You do remember.

21:46.055 --> 21:47.966
(SIGHING)

21:57.859 --> 22:00.566
With a fireplace
to keep us warm.

22:01.029 --> 22:03.941
And a summer breeze
to keep us cool.

22:07.619 --> 22:09.280
How do you do it?

22:11.039 --> 22:15.874
Every single time.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.931
This is so beautiful.
How did you do this?

22:35.021 --> 22:37.763
My friends and I can do
the most amazing things.

22:37.857 --> 22:39.768
Look.
There's your dream cottage.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.850
No more traveling now.
We're making a home,
a real home.

22:41.945 --> 22:44.357
For me, for you.
If you'll have me.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.857
(SIGHS)

22:46.199 --> 22:47.359
Sam.

22:48.201 --> 22:51.989
You said you couldn't
join a carnival.
But now you don't have to.

22:52.080 --> 22:55.993
There's no more
carriage homes,
no more main homes. Just...

22:56.584 --> 22:57.994
Just that.

22:58.419 --> 23:01.081
Away from everything.
It's what you talked about.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.037
It could be our life.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.220
I can't live here.

23:12.058 --> 23:13.047
But you said...

23:13.142 --> 23:15.599
I know, I know,
I know what I said.

23:15.937 --> 23:17.347
It's just that
I didn't think
you'd actually...

23:17.438 --> 23:18.427
Actually do it?

23:18.523 --> 23:19.603
Yeah.

23:19.691 --> 23:22.649
But... I mean...

23:23.570 --> 23:27.279
This dress and
the milkshake and...

23:28.449 --> 23:31.361
All of this.
This is a fantasy.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.580
And I made it come true.
For you.

23:34.664 --> 23:37.497
No, Sam. For you.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.249
This is your fantasy.

23:41.588 --> 23:46.002
And it's beautiful.
And I'm happy for you.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.636
But it isn't me.

23:53.516 --> 23:55.757
My life isn't here.

23:55.893 --> 23:57.508
Butlchanged
everything for...

23:57.604 --> 23:59.811
Don't tell me
you did all
of this for me.

23:59.897 --> 24:04.732
Please, don't...
Don't tell me
this was all for me.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.445
No, of course not.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.113
Listen, I should
get you back home.

24:19.208 --> 24:20.618
Thank you
for indulging me.

24:20.710 --> 24:21.699
Sam.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.204
No, it was really...

24:29.510 --> 24:32.092
It was really nice
to see you again.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.900
Gretchen. Gretchen.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.027
Are you okay?

24:54.118 --> 24:56.530
I'm fine.
All things considered.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.078
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

24:59.165 --> 25:02.202
You never
should have gotten
caught up in it.

25:02.293 --> 25:06.536
I'm just...
I'm happy you're here.
And that it's over.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.582
It is over, isn't it?

25:12.887 --> 25:15.299
No. He's not done...

25:22.105 --> 25:23.060
Somewhere out in the open?

25:23.147 --> 25:24.307
No. He'll be
expecting that.

25:24.440 --> 25:25.816
He's trying
to flush us out.

25:25.942 --> 25:27.603
How do you know?

25:27.694 --> 25:30.561
'Cause apparently,
I get the way he thinks.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.816
Someone's coming.

25:32.907 --> 25:33.942
ln here.

25:39.664 --> 25:43.452
So, Sylar, huh?
The Sylar?

25:44.168 --> 25:48.787
Yes. Well, no. Kind of
the emo-apologist version.

25:48.965 --> 25:52.173
He's had me
trying to figure out
what his issues are.

25:52.301 --> 25:54.337
Seriously?
How'd that go?

25:55.513 --> 25:57.299
Pencil in the eye.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.301
Listen, I'm sorry.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.688
It's okay.
Getting used to being
all Perils of Pauline.

26:07.817 --> 26:11.309
No, not about that.
Well, yes,
about that, but...

26:14.407 --> 26:16.068
...about breakfast.

26:17.577 --> 26:21.490
About sometimes
keeping you
at arm's length.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.779
It's cool.
Are you kidding?

26:23.875 --> 26:24.910
If you don't want to...

26:25.001 --> 26:26.616
I do want to.

26:26.711 --> 26:31.922
ljust... I'm scared.
And I get afraid that
I'm gonna get hurt.

26:32.008 --> 26:37.002
And so I use
my "specialness"
to build these walls

26:37.096 --> 26:39.963
instead ofjumping
off bridges.

26:41.517 --> 26:45.476
I suck at metaphors,
but what I'm trying
to say is that...

26:46.189 --> 26:47.929
It's okay, really.

26:48.024 --> 26:50.390
No. No, it's not.

26:52.862 --> 26:54.693
This guy, Sylar,

26:56.157 --> 27:00.150
he sat there and told me
that we're very much alike.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.030
And he's not wrong.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.449
And I'm afraid
that I'm going
to end up alone

27:04.540 --> 27:07.407
for the rest
of my life,
like him.

27:07.502 --> 27:09.993
And I don't know
how to fix it.

27:12.215 --> 27:14.501
Do you want
to talk about it?

27:16.093 --> 27:21.258
I like to think of myself
as just a girl who happens
to have powers,

27:21.390 --> 27:24.678
and it's just one thing
in a list of attributes.

27:25.019 --> 27:29.888
Loyal, friendly,
regenerative, good skin.
You know?

27:29.982 --> 27:31.563
You do have good skin.

27:31.651 --> 27:33.312
(LAUGHS)

27:33.402 --> 27:37.361
But when you put
the chips down
and life gets tough,

27:39.242 --> 27:44.532
I hide behind
that one label,
that one attribute.

27:45.414 --> 27:47.700
And | close myself off.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.840
No wonder
Sylar is so messed up.

27:54.924 --> 27:58.883
I can only imagine
what having
a bunch of excuses

27:58.970 --> 28:01.382
could do to
someone's humanity.

28:02.098 --> 28:04.089
Maybe that's his answer.

28:04.642 --> 28:06.007
In order to become
human again,

28:06.102 --> 28:09.139
he has to get rid
of all of his powers.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.762
Yeah, maybe.

28:17.738 --> 28:19.444
Now was that so hard?

28:19.574 --> 28:21.280
You son of a bitch.

28:21.993 --> 28:23.449
Where is she?

28:25.288 --> 28:26.573
lt's dinnertime.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.368
I imagine she's right
where you left her.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.075
You never took her.

28:34.547 --> 28:35.957
Like I said,

28:37.592 --> 28:40.800
I've been having
a little trouble
being myself.

28:59.488 --> 29:00.773
Gretchen?

29:02.992 --> 29:04.698
(SIGHS)

29:04.785 --> 29:05.911
You're okay.

29:05.995 --> 29:07.280
Yeah.

29:07.622 --> 29:09.158
Of course I'm okay.

29:09.248 --> 29:12.615
Well, some guy
stole my backpack, but...
What's with you?

29:12.710 --> 29:16.077
Nothing. I'm fine,
and you're here,
and you're all right.

29:16.172 --> 29:18.458
Claire, you're
acting really weird.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.336
I'm sorry. I'm really
lucky to have you.

29:21.427 --> 29:24.009
And I'm sorry
about this morning.

29:25.181 --> 29:26.921
Forget it.
You know me.

29:27.016 --> 29:29.928
Impulsive Gretchen
wants to hold hands,
so she does it.

29:30.019 --> 29:33.261
I know, and I love that
about you. And I want
to be more like that.

29:33.356 --> 29:38.316
Not be beholden
to any label or definition

29:38.402 --> 29:41.018
or who I'm supposed
to be. ljust...

29:43.699 --> 29:45.815
I want to hold your hand.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.119
People are gonna
start to talk.

29:54.210 --> 29:55.700
Let 'em talk.

29:56.087 --> 29:59.329
Talking's good.
In fact, I could
use some talking

29:59.423 --> 30:02.085
if you still have
a sympathetic ear.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.883
l, in fact,
have two ears.

Am I scaring you?

Sir, ljust
wanted to know...

39:08.180 --> 39:11.138
You don't think I can
see how you're looking
at me right now?

39:11.225 --> 39:12.965
That I'm different.

39:14.811 --> 39:18.599
Looking down your nose at me,
like I'm not good enough.

He's not here
right now.

41:32.616 --> 41:33.901
Oh.

Is there any way
that you could tell me
where he is?

It's really important
that I speak with him.

41:40.082 --> 41:43.199
Sure. I'm sorry. Have we met?
