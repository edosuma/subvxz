00:12.200 --> 00:14.361
"Previously on" 24.

00:14.441 --> 00:18.083
- What's going on with Jack Bauer?
- The operation wasn't completely successful.

00:18.203 --> 00:21.004
They do have Saunders's daughter,
but they were unable to remain covert.

00:21.084 --> 00:23.285
- So Saunders knows we have her?
- No. Not yet.

00:23.365 --> 00:25.687
But C.T.U. Is estimating
he'll find out within the hour.

00:25.807 --> 00:28.648
The deadline for his next demand is
gonna be up in about 15 minutes.

00:28.728 --> 00:32.850
Giving this guy a list of every foreign
operative on our payroll is an act of treason.

00:32.930 --> 00:36.412
I will not give in
to Saunders's latest demand.

00:36.532 --> 00:39.173
We've run out of time.
We need you to call your father.

00:39.293 --> 00:43.575
- And tell him what?
- Anything. We just want you
to keep him on the line.

00:43.695 --> 00:45.616
- Jane.
- Hi, Dad.

00:45.736 --> 00:48.658
What's wrong? I told you only to use
this number in an emergency.

00:48.778 --> 00:52.059
- Someone is monitoring the call.
- They've got her.

00:52.139 --> 00:56.382
There's a man named Jack Bauer with you,
isn't there? Hand the phone to him.

00:56.502 --> 01:00.584
You know how many vials I have
and what I'm capable of.

01:00.704 --> 01:02.585
You know what I'm capable of too.

01:09.788 --> 01:12.589
Stephen Saunders, this is Jack Bauer.

01:12.670 --> 01:14.711
You're completely surrounded.

01:14.831 --> 01:17.512
The president has refused to capitulate
to any further demands.

01:17.632 --> 01:19.993
The only way you're getting
out of this thing alive...

01:20.073 --> 01:22.114
is coming through the front door
with your hands on your head.

01:22.234 --> 01:25.076
That's just not exactly true, Jack.

01:25.156 --> 01:27.437
I'd like to offer you congratulations
on your wife...

01:27.557 --> 01:29.478
eluding infection
from the virus.

01:29.598 --> 01:31.439
How do you know about my wife?

01:31.519 --> 01:34.280
I don't know exactly what
they're doing to her, Tony...

01:34.400 --> 01:37.562
but I did instruct them to leave her barely
functional so we can return her to you.

01:37.642 --> 01:41.003
There are five agents watching
the northeast exit of this building.

01:41.123 --> 01:44.965
Send them to the front entrance. Michelle will
be dead if you don't do what I say.

01:45.085 --> 01:46.646
- This is Tony Almeida.
- What are we doing?

01:46.766 --> 01:48.327
Move everyone to the front now.

01:48.447 --> 01:50.888
In your car. Move to the front of
the building. Down! Down!

01:51.008 --> 01:52.929
Fold up! Fall back!

01:59.813 --> 02:03.094
The following takes place
between 9:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m.

02:09.417 --> 02:10.937
Move the team up.

02:11.058 --> 02:14.019
Stephen Saunders,
this is your final warning.

02:14.140 --> 02:16.581
Come out of the building now.

02:30.908 --> 02:34.830
- Smoke him out.
- Release the tear gas.

02:34.950 --> 02:37.231
We're a go.

02:44.754 --> 02:46.835
Send them in.

02:46.956 --> 02:48.596
Perimeter teams move in. Move in!

02:48.716 --> 02:52.198
All right, boys. Let's go. Let's go!

02:52.278 --> 02:54.359
Get going now! Move!

02:59.202 --> 03:02.123
- Baker!
- Over there.

03:03.484 --> 03:05.445
Why aren't you covering
the south perimeter?

03:05.565 --> 03:07.926
C.T.U. Moved us off our position.
They said you needed us out front.

03:08.046 --> 03:10.127
- What are you talking about?
- They said the sat feed...

03:10.247 --> 03:12.648
showed Saunders moving toward a blind spot
in the front of the building.

03:16.570 --> 03:19.411
- " Clear down there."
- Check the other room.

03:19.531 --> 03:22.533
All teams respond. I repeat, all teams
respond. Any sign of Saunders?

03:22.653 --> 03:25.014
- " Apartment's clear!"
- Jack, we're in.

03:25.134 --> 03:26.855
- Still no sign of him.
- Who gave you that order?

03:26.935 --> 03:31.097
- Tony.
- Move your team back to their mark now. Move.

03:31.217 --> 03:33.418
Move out. Let's go.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.461
C.T.U., Almeida.

03:38.581 --> 03:41.942
Tony, it's Jack. Baker just told me
you pulled his team out of position.

03:42.062 --> 03:44.103
Yeah. I was working off
the information I had.

03:44.223 --> 03:46.585
It was bad information.
You should have cleared it with me.

03:46.705 --> 03:49.066
Somebody in my team made a mistake.
I'm looking into it now.

03:49.146 --> 03:52.468
Tony, that's an unacceptable mistake.
I have tactical command in the field.

03:52.588 --> 03:55.309
If you can't run C.T.U., you better replace
yourself with someone who can.

04:01.072 --> 04:03.113
- Chase, check in.
- Yeah, Jack.

04:03.233 --> 04:06.154
We've covered the entire building.
He's not here.

04:09.716 --> 04:12.677
Damn it!

04:12.797 --> 04:16.439
- Saunders doesn't seem to be in the building.
- What do you mean he's not there?

04:16.559 --> 04:19.241
- He's gotta be in there.
- He's gone. What were you telling Jack about...

04:19.321 --> 04:21.841
- someone in your group making a mistake?
- Never mind, Chloe.

04:21.962 --> 04:24.243
Adam, are you sure we tracked Saunders
to the right building?

04:24.323 --> 04:26.644
Of course we did, Tony. He was in there
when Jack made that phone call.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.925
I'm pulling up the imagery now
to find out what went wrong.

04:29.045 --> 04:32.087
I'll take care of that.
You stay with Chloe, cover the site teams.

05:13.707 --> 05:15.948
- Almeida.
- I hope you covered your tracks...

05:16.028 --> 05:17.949
and purged the incriminating
satellite frames.

05:18.069 --> 05:21.351
I did what you wanted me to.
Now where's my wife?

05:21.471 --> 05:25.233
Not so fast. I like to do things in phases.
You should know that by now.

05:25.313 --> 05:28.795
That was phase one.
Next, we have to talk about my daughter.

05:28.915 --> 05:31.396
- What about her?
- I want her back, of course.

05:31.516 --> 05:34.837
- Yeah, well, I want my wife back.
- Then there should be no problem.

05:34.958 --> 05:38.919
- Where's Jane now?
- She's on her way here.
She should be here in five minutes.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.281
Good. When she gets there,
get the men to guard her...

05:41.401 --> 05:44.122
and make sure they will
follow your orders without question.

05:44.202 --> 05:47.164
If any harm comes to
my daughter, your wife dies.

05:47.324 --> 05:50.285
If Jane is not released
when I order it, your wife dies.

05:50.405 --> 05:55.007
- That's all you need to know. Are we clear?
- " Tony, are you in there?"

05:55.127 --> 05:58.729
- Tony, President Palmer's on the line for you.
- I'll do my part. You do yours.

05:58.849 --> 06:00.410
- "Tony."
- That's the spirit.

06:00.530 --> 06:03.491
- "Tony, are you there?"
- Adam, I'm here.

06:03.612 --> 06:05.853
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Put the president through.

06:05.933 --> 06:08.614
- Okay. Hang on.
- This is Tony Almeida.

06:08.734 --> 06:12.416
Please hold for the president.

06:12.496 --> 06:15.137
Mr. Almeida, I just heard
you lost Stephen Saunders. Is that true?

06:15.257 --> 06:16.778
Yes, sir. Unfortunately, it is.

06:16.898 --> 06:20.100
I thought C.T.U. was certain
of his location. What happened?

06:20.180 --> 06:22.381
We're looking into it now, sir.

06:22.501 --> 06:24.302
Does Saunders know
we're holding his daughter?

06:24.382 --> 06:28.184
Yes, sir. He does.
And she's obviously very important to him.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.144
Is Jane Saunders with you now?

06:30.225 --> 06:32.065
No. She's on her way here right now, sir.

06:32.145 --> 06:34.427
Mr. Almeida, I don't have to remind you...

06:34.507 --> 06:37.348
how much security we're
gonna need around her today.

06:37.468 --> 06:39.909
She is the only thing
that is standing between us...

06:40.029 --> 06:41.830
and Stephen Saunders
controlling the government.

06:41.950 --> 06:45.312
- Yes, Mr. President. We're aware of that.
- Good.

06:45.432 --> 06:49.834
- Keep me posted.
- Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

06:54.436 --> 06:57.758
As yet, the Keeler campaign
has not issued a comment.

06:57.878 --> 06:59.879
We now go live with the senator.

07:00.039 --> 07:02.400
Senator. Senator Keeler.

07:02.480 --> 07:04.841
Do you feel this is going to do
serious damage to your campaign?

07:04.961 --> 07:07.923
Absolutely not.
My record on labor speaks for itself.

07:08.043 --> 07:12.685
Remember, I voted against NAFTA, and I favor
tax incentives for domestic manufacturing.

07:12.805 --> 07:15.767
- "What about the other endorsements you lost?"
- Who did he lose?

07:15.887 --> 07:18.248
AFL-CIO and a couple of veteran groups.

07:18.368 --> 07:20.969
- "Why?"
- They're not pleased with his negative spin...

07:21.049 --> 07:22.570
on your withdrawal from the debate.

07:22.730 --> 07:24.611
Now that the threat level's
been raised to red...

07:24.691 --> 07:26.492
people realize you aren't
the one playing politics, he is.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.253
We can't waste time thinking
about the election right now.

07:29.373 --> 07:32.135
The only thing that matters
is stopping Stephen Saunders.

07:32.255 --> 07:35.176
- Would you come with me, please?
Excuse us, Jerry.
- Yes, sir.

07:35.336 --> 07:39.458
We will be scheduling a press conference
shortly, and we'll address all these issues.

07:39.538 --> 07:40.979
Thanks very much. Good day.

07:42.780 --> 07:45.941
No, Adam, he was in the building.

07:46.062 --> 07:49.623
- We found the room he was using.
I wanna know how he got out.
- We're working on it.

07:49.703 --> 07:52.265
- I'll call you when we get something.
- What'd he say?

07:52.345 --> 07:54.986
I don't understand this, Jack.
We pinpointed Saunders's location.

07:55.106 --> 07:58.187
He disappears into thin air. Now C.T.U. says
they're having problems with the satellite.

07:58.268 --> 08:00.268
We'll look into it. Baker, this is Jack.

08:00.389 --> 08:03.430
- I want two teams on patrol,
two more on standby, copy?
- Will do.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.511
- What about us?
- We're going to C.T.U.

08:05.631 --> 08:08.593
- I wanna be with Saunders's
daughter when he calls back.
- All right.

08:21.519 --> 08:24.360
How did Saunders get past us?
We had every exit covered.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.962
Could he have access to
our tracking systems?

08:27.082 --> 08:28.962
- C.T.U. O'Brian.
- Chloe, it's Jack. What are you working on?

08:29.043 --> 08:31.564
We're all trying to pick up
a thread on Saunders.

08:31.684 --> 08:34.965
I'm analyzing his last phone call to you
to see if there's any tell on the carrier.

08:35.085 --> 08:38.047
Is it possible that he wasn't even in the
building? That he was routing his calls?

08:38.167 --> 08:41.008
No. He did that earlier at the apartment.
Now that I have his counterfeit signature...

08:41.168 --> 08:43.409
he wouldn't be able to
do it without our knowing it.

08:43.530 --> 08:45.491
Okay. Get back to me
as soon as you've got anything.

08:45.651 --> 08:48.972
Something's not right here.

09:06.341 --> 09:08.702
- This is C.T. U?
- Yes.

09:08.782 --> 09:11.183
Kim, your father wants you to know that
he and Chase are on their way back.

09:11.263 --> 09:13.624
- With Saunders?
- No.

09:13.744 --> 09:17.026
- "Why not?"
- He wasn't in the building.
They're trying to locate him.

09:17.146 --> 09:19.587
- They haven't captured my father?
- No.

09:19.707 --> 09:22.709
- But he knows you guys have me, right?
- Yes, he does.

09:26.431 --> 09:28.752
- Agent Forrester, Tony Almeida.
- Tony.

09:28.832 --> 09:31.033
We're gonna be putting
Miss Saunders in a holding room.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.354
I was told you were setting up
a white room.

09:33.434 --> 09:36.756
Yeah. That's changed. If you walk her to
the back, security will take her from there.

09:36.876 --> 09:39.077
You'll be fine, okay?

09:40.637 --> 09:43.879
- How are you doing?
- I can't believe that Saunders escaped.

09:43.959 --> 09:47.321
I mean, how could this happen?
I thought that he was surrounded.

09:47.441 --> 09:50.122
It happened. Look, Rae Placheki's
coming here to talk to you.

09:50.202 --> 09:52.723
You're gonna have to answer some questions
about the shooting at the library.

09:52.843 --> 09:55.805
Okay. Look, I heard the news
about Michelle.

09:55.925 --> 09:59.767
- What news?
- That she isn't infected.

09:59.927 --> 10:03.689
Oh, um, yeah.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.370
- I'm glad that she's okay. That's great.
- Yeah. Thanks.

11:10.922 --> 11:13.283
There's no way to be exactly sure.

11:13.403 --> 11:18.085
Some people don't show
symptoms for five or six hours.

11:18.165 --> 11:20.646
Adam.

11:20.766 --> 11:22.807
Didn't they talk to you about your options?

11:22.927 --> 11:26.529
They said they could
give me a pill so l...

11:26.649 --> 11:29.250
so I won't suffer.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.973
- Adam, I need to talk to you now.
- Sarah, hold on.

11:34.093 --> 11:37.815
- I'm talking to my sister now.
- The one who got infected with the virus?

11:37.895 --> 11:40.416
I'm not even going to answer that, Chloe.

11:40.536 --> 11:44.578
I'm sorry. I'll just wait here
until you're done.

11:44.698 --> 11:47.539
- Chloe.
- Adam, I'm sorry. This is really important.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.301
I just need you to finish up
as quickly as you can.

11:52.422 --> 11:56.104
Sarah, I'm gonna have to call you back
as soon as I can, okay?

11:56.224 --> 11:58.585
- Okay.
- I love you.

11:58.665 --> 12:01.386
- I love you too.
- What?

12:01.466 --> 12:03.587
I checked with satellite navigation.
They said they're missing frames...

12:03.667 --> 12:06.028
and they're certain it's on our end.

12:06.149 --> 12:08.029
What about the backup
on the F.G.A. Volume?

12:08.109 --> 12:10.150
Gone. Not only that,
they cover about 20 seconds...

12:10.311 --> 12:12.672
so if Saunders did escape the building,
it was within that exact interval.

12:12.792 --> 12:16.394
- So there was a glitch
at exactly the wrong moment?
- What are the chances of that?

12:16.474 --> 12:21.076
- Not good.
- So I'm thinking Saunders
has access to our system.

12:21.196 --> 12:24.557
- Did you tell Tony yet?
- No. I want more information before I go to him.

12:24.678 --> 12:27.399
But I checked with Field Ops
and all their systems are accounted for.

12:27.479 --> 12:29.840
I need you to do the same in comm.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.361
Do you really think there's someone
inside C.T.U. Working for Saunders?

12:32.481 --> 12:35.243
It's the only thing that makes sense
right now. If you could do that...

12:35.363 --> 12:38.644
- then you could call your sister back.
- Yeah.

12:55.613 --> 12:58.054
- Hey, Pete. I need a few minutes alone.
- "Sure thing."

13:04.457 --> 13:09.259
- How are you doing?
- Why am I being treated
like I've done something wrong?

13:11.861 --> 13:16.143
I apologize for that.
We're just trying to keep you safe.

13:17.703 --> 13:19.784
This is the one place I am not safe.

13:21.105 --> 13:23.426
I've been thinking about it.

13:23.506 --> 13:26.228
You need me to get to my father.

13:26.308 --> 13:30.950
So threatening to kill me or harm me is
the only tool you have to use against him.

13:31.030 --> 13:34.031
Tell me I'm wrong.

13:40.354 --> 13:43.036
You're right.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.197
We need your father to believe
we'll do anything to get him.

13:46.317 --> 13:51.280
But we're not gonna hurt you.
I give you my word.

13:51.360 --> 13:53.561
Your word?

13:53.681 --> 13:56.042
Yeah. My word.

13:56.122 --> 14:00.084
I run this office,
and I will personally protect you.

14:00.204 --> 14:03.686
What about Kim's father? They told her
that he's on his way back here.

14:05.327 --> 14:09.409
- What about him?
- He scares me.

14:09.529 --> 14:13.171
I got the feeling
he's willing to hurt me.

14:13.251 --> 14:17.653
Nobody's gonna hurt you, all right?

14:17.813 --> 14:20.774
I wish I could believe you.

14:22.895 --> 14:25.216
- Almeida.
- Has Jane arrived?

14:25.336 --> 14:28.178
- Yeah.
- Where is she?

14:28.338 --> 14:31.980
- She's here.
- Put her on.

14:32.060 --> 14:35.221
No. You have my wife.
I wanna talk to her first.

14:35.341 --> 14:38.023
- You don't give me orders.
- You're wrong.

14:38.103 --> 14:40.864
I have your daughter,
which means I'm in charge.

14:40.984 --> 14:44.986
Now if you so much as touch my wife,
I will slit Jane's throat.

14:47.707 --> 14:49.588
Hold on.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.516
Sorry for your discomfort.
Hopefully, it's temporary.

15:05.596 --> 15:07.357
Uncuff her.

15:07.437 --> 15:10.679
I'm going to let you
speak to your husband.

15:10.759 --> 15:14.480
Tell him that you're okay and you're being
treated well. Nothing more.

15:14.560 --> 15:16.561
Understood?

15:21.604 --> 15:24.445
- Tony, it's me.
- Michelle.

15:24.565 --> 15:26.967
- He won't let me say much.
- Are you all right?

15:27.087 --> 15:31.609
I'm fine. I'm being treated well.

15:31.689 --> 15:35.010
- Don't let them do this. Don't listen to...
- None of that.

15:35.090 --> 15:40.173
- Michelle?
- Let me speak with my daughter, Mr. Almeida.

15:45.496 --> 15:48.657
It's your father. He wants to talk to you.

15:51.338 --> 15:54.620
- Dad?
- Yes, Jane. It's me.

15:54.780 --> 15:57.181
They're saying horrible things
about you.

15:57.341 --> 15:59.743
That's what they do.
Don't believe any of it.

15:59.903 --> 16:03.985
The virus in the hotel
that's killing all of those people?

16:05.906 --> 16:08.867
You didn't do that?
Please tell me that you didn't do that.

16:08.987 --> 16:13.469
Listen to me, Jane. The U.S. Government
distorts the truth and destroys lives.

16:13.549 --> 16:16.231
Don't listen to any of it. It's all lies.

16:16.351 --> 16:18.592
Then you didn't do it?

16:18.672 --> 16:22.314
I'd never do something
without good cause.

16:22.434 --> 16:24.595
You know that.

16:24.675 --> 16:27.596
- You know...
- That's all. Let's do this.

16:27.716 --> 16:30.598
How long will it take for you to
get her out of the building?

16:30.758 --> 16:34.079
I have to fabricate some clearances.
It's gonna take me 30 to 40 minutes.

16:34.239 --> 16:38.001
Contact me as soon as you clear C.T.U.
Take down this number.

16:41.763 --> 16:45.045
You were right. Someone from Tony's group
purged the frames in the surveillance feed.

16:45.125 --> 16:49.407
- Do you know who?
- It was a no-name log-in.
It could've been here or Division.

16:49.527 --> 16:52.368
- I better tell Tony so he can
lock down the system.
- Okay.

16:52.488 --> 16:54.849
C.T.U. O'Brian.

16:54.969 --> 16:57.931
This is Sunny Macer from Health Services.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.852
Sunny, what can I do for you?

16:59.972 --> 17:01.973
Have you heard from Michelle Dessler
in the last half hour?

17:02.093 --> 17:03.974
No. She was sent to
your office for observation.

17:04.134 --> 17:05.734
That's actually why I'm calling.

17:05.855 --> 17:07.935
We got a message that she asked to be
taken to County instead.

17:08.056 --> 17:11.337
But she's not at County and she's definitely
not here. We can't get a hold of her.

17:11.417 --> 17:14.259
- I'll check on it and get back to you.
- All right. Thanks.

17:17.741 --> 17:20.902
- Davis.
- Davis, get me Mike Redmond.
He's with Michelle Dessler.

17:21.021 --> 17:22.823
All right.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.266
- He's not answering.
- What do you mean he's not answering?

17:28.386 --> 17:30.347
He's active. He has to answer.

17:30.467 --> 17:33.748
- He's not answering.
- Okay. I heard you the first time.

17:34.789 --> 17:36.790
And you're sure about this?

17:36.910 --> 17:40.712
Yes, Tony, of course I'm sure.
There are 79 users in your group...

17:40.832 --> 17:44.113
and one of them's been playing games
with the uplink recording.

17:44.274 --> 17:46.875
All right. Well, uh, we're gonna have to
lock everything down then.

17:46.955 --> 17:50.196
Well, obviously, I agree.
You want me to do it now?

17:50.317 --> 17:52.197
- Yeah.
- Okay.

17:54.318 --> 17:57.080
- What is it?
- Something weird's happening with Michelle.

17:57.200 --> 18:00.481
- What do you mean?
- No one can find her;
Redmond's not answering his pages.

18:00.602 --> 18:05.804
That's because I overrode N.H.S.'s order.
I didn't want them to know about it.

18:05.964 --> 18:10.686
I'm putting Michelle in quarantine in
one of our substations so she can work.

18:10.807 --> 18:13.768
- I need every warm body I can get.
- What am I gonna tell Macer?

18:13.888 --> 18:17.930
- I'll call her. There's something
else I want you to do.
- What is it?

18:18.010 --> 18:20.531
I'm sending you the record of a phone call
between Saunders and myself...

18:20.651 --> 18:23.293
- from a few minutes ago.
- You just spoke to him?

18:23.413 --> 18:25.814
Yeah. I want you to strip away the carrier
signal, see if you use it to find him.

18:25.934 --> 18:29.456
- What about the voice track?
- He's scrambling. It's useless.

18:29.576 --> 18:33.698
- Fine.
- Chloe.

18:33.778 --> 18:37.860
Do it in Tech 1, away from everybody.
I don't want Adam to know about it.

18:37.940 --> 18:43.382
- Why not?
- Well, technically, it's his job.

18:43.462 --> 18:45.343
But you're better at it.

18:49.265 --> 18:52.947
- Why did you just say that?
- Because it's true.

19:14.838 --> 19:16.639
Keeler campaign headquarters.

19:16.759 --> 19:20.400
Damn it, Mark. You assured me going on the
offensive against Palmer was the right thing.

19:20.481 --> 19:23.322
- Now it's backfiring.
- Come on, John. That's not fair.

19:23.442 --> 19:27.484
Palmer walks out of the debate moments after
you brought up the charge against his girlfriend.

19:27.604 --> 19:31.246
Everyone assumed that the whole
national security excuse was just a cover.

19:31.326 --> 19:35.128
Well, apparently it wasn't. The alert level's
at red, and the airports are shut down.

19:35.248 --> 19:38.729
- I know.
- All right.

19:41.211 --> 19:45.133
Palmer still hasn't told the public
any of the details about this threat.

19:45.253 --> 19:48.414
Call Alex in the Pentagon.
See what you can find out about it.

19:48.534 --> 19:52.776
Depending on what it turns out to be, I may
need to be proactive and issue an apology.

19:52.896 --> 19:56.698
Yeah.

19:56.778 --> 19:59.980
Sherry Palmer will be here
in five minutes to talk to the senator.

20:00.060 --> 20:03.742
- What's this about?
- She wants to see the senator
about a high-value proposition.

20:03.822 --> 20:06.183
All right. Hold on.

20:06.303 --> 20:08.664
It's Sherry Palmer.
She wants to come here in five minutes.

20:08.744 --> 20:10.945
- Why?
- She wouldn't say...

20:11.065 --> 20:13.306
except that it's
a high-value proposition...

20:13.426 --> 20:16.388
and she wants to present it
face-to-face.

20:16.508 --> 20:18.269
Set it up.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.951
- All right. The senator will be here.
- I'll let her know.

20:24.152 --> 20:26.953
This should be interesting.

20:31.315 --> 20:34.116
- I'll offload the systems from Field Ops.
- I'll be right up.

20:34.237 --> 20:36.037
- Adam, where's Tony?
- He's with Jane Saunders.

20:36.157 --> 20:39.199
Kim's waiting to be debriefed on
the shooting, and I'm working with N.H.S.

20:39.279 --> 20:41.600
- N.H.S? Why aren't you tracking Saunders?
- Tony put Chloe in charge.

20:41.720 --> 20:44.081
- Well, where's Chloe?
- Tech 1.

20:44.161 --> 20:46.923
- Why isn't she in Field Ops?
- You haven't talked to Tony yet?

20:47.043 --> 20:50.324
- About what?
- Jack, it looks like
someone from Tony's group...

20:50.404 --> 20:53.246
intentionally wiped out those sat frames
from the Saunders surveillance.

20:53.366 --> 20:55.327
- That's how he was able to evade us.
- What?

20:55.487 --> 20:59.809
Adam, N.H.S. wants those coordinates or
they're going to widen the quarantine zone.

20:59.929 --> 21:02.050
Okay. That's all I know, Jack.
I gotta get back on this.

21:02.170 --> 21:05.452
Okay, fine.

21:09.694 --> 21:13.456
- We may be moving you in a few minutes.
- "Where?"

21:13.576 --> 21:15.817
- To Division.
- What's that?

21:17.698 --> 21:20.459
- Yeah?
- "Tony, it's Jack."

21:20.579 --> 21:22.780
I need to speak with you.
Meet me outside the observation room.

21:22.860 --> 21:25.221
Yeah, all right. I'll be right back.

21:34.506 --> 21:36.947
- Jack.
- What the hell is going on?

21:37.067 --> 21:40.389
Adam told me that you think you've got
someone on the inside working with Saunders?

21:40.509 --> 21:43.350
- It hasn't been confirmed yet,
but I have Chloe working on it.
- What's she doing?

21:43.430 --> 21:46.512
Taking a look at the status logs to see
if there's anything out of the ordinary.

21:46.632 --> 21:50.314
Tony, if this is true, we've gotta call Division,
get Spec Ops down here immediately.

21:50.394 --> 21:52.635
I thought about that,
but I don't wanna raise any red flags.

21:52.715 --> 21:54.676
If someone in our group
is working with Saunders...

21:54.796 --> 21:56.757
I don't want them to know
that we're on to them.

22:01.719 --> 22:04.561
Fine. You and I will work this up together,
but I want Division...

22:04.681 --> 22:07.562
to come pick up Jane Saunders
so they can continue questioning her.

22:07.642 --> 22:10.804
- Good idea.
- I'll call Brad Hammond.
I'll meet you in Tech 1.

22:10.924 --> 22:12.685
- We'll go through everything with Chloe.
- Wait, Jack.

22:12.805 --> 22:15.846
Uh, look, I have a 30-minute status call
scheduled with Hammond anyway.

22:15.926 --> 22:18.768
Why don't you let me tell him,
and you can go up to Field Ops.

22:18.928 --> 22:21.649
Okay. Fine.

22:43.219 --> 22:47.341
Adam, is Tony set up for 30-minute
status calls with Brad Hammond?

22:50.583 --> 22:53.224
If he is, it's not in the books.

22:54.225 --> 22:56.386
Thanks.

23:07.031 --> 23:10.673
Thank you very much. John, hello.

23:12.434 --> 23:15.755
How nice to see you. I don't believe you know
Mark Kaner, my campaign manager.

23:15.835 --> 23:18.277
- I don't. Only by reputation.
Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

23:18.397 --> 23:23.839
- So, what brings you here?
- Well, um, actually, it's a private matter, John.

23:25.240 --> 23:28.882
- Let us have a minute, Mark.
- No problem.

23:33.884 --> 23:35.845
Please.

23:35.965 --> 23:39.647
I, um... I heard about the endorsements
you lost this morning.

23:39.727 --> 23:42.088
Daily fluctuation.
Doesn't mean a thing.

23:42.168 --> 23:45.810
"Doesn't mean a thing."
That's pretty optimistic, John.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.531
No, your, um...
your campaign is imploding.

23:48.611 --> 23:53.654
By the time the press has a chance to analyze
all the mistakes you made last night...

23:53.774 --> 23:56.535
you'll look like a desperate candidate
gasping his last breath.

23:56.655 --> 23:59.057
Look, Sherry, if you came here
to insult me, I'm rather busy.

23:59.177 --> 24:01.858
No, no. John, on the contrary. Relax.

24:01.978 --> 24:06.940
I, um... I came here because...

24:07.060 --> 24:09.181
I can guarantee you a win in November.

24:11.062 --> 24:16.345
What I'm about to tell you, I will deny
to my grave if you try to hold it against me.

24:16.465 --> 24:20.027
So, that's clear, right?

24:20.147 --> 24:23.709
John, we are clear on that, right?

24:27.390 --> 24:29.271
Good.

24:33.793 --> 24:37.195
David Palmer is an accessory to murder.

24:38.676 --> 24:42.118
- Whose murder?
- Alan Milliken.

24:42.238 --> 24:45.559
- Alan Milliken died of a heart attack.
- He did. But he didn't have to.

24:45.679 --> 24:48.721
His nitroglycerin was just an arm's length
away, but he couldn't get to it...

24:48.801 --> 24:50.682
because someone kept it from him.

24:50.842 --> 24:52.643
Now how could you possibly know that?

24:52.763 --> 24:55.124
Because that someone was me.

25:00.286 --> 25:03.008
Sherry, I think
you had better leave right now.

25:03.088 --> 25:07.930
- Really? So you can watch your
entire career leave with me?
- If what you're saying is true...

25:08.090 --> 25:11.052
- I don't want anything to do with you.
- Oh, come on. Spare me, John.

25:11.172 --> 25:14.093
You haven't gotten this far without getting
a little dirt under your fingernails.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.694
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- No. Of course not.

25:16.814 --> 25:20.576
But, for the sake of conversation,
just allow me to paint you a picture.

25:20.696 --> 25:23.138
- I, uh...
- Please. It won't take but a moment.

25:23.258 --> 25:26.299
Just indulge me.

25:26.419 --> 25:29.421
Very well.

25:34.463 --> 25:38.865
David lied to the chief of police last night
in order to provide an alibi for me.

25:38.985 --> 25:41.346
And I can prove that he lied.

25:41.466 --> 25:43.307
No. You think about that.

25:43.387 --> 25:46.789
Proof that the president
of the United States lied...

25:46.949 --> 25:49.190
- to cover a murder.
- What kind of proof?

25:49.310 --> 25:53.392
Besides my confession? I have
the prescription bottle he was reaching for.

25:53.472 --> 25:57.754
I was holding it,
and I have it in a very safe place.

25:59.875 --> 26:03.357
You are talking about
incriminating yourself.

26:03.477 --> 26:07.159
- You would go to prison.
- Yes, I know that.

26:07.239 --> 26:10.481
But so would David.
David lied to the police...

26:10.601 --> 26:13.202
to save himself.

26:13.282 --> 26:15.163
It's quite simple, John.

26:15.243 --> 26:19.325
All you have to do is go to David,
and tell him that you have this evidence...

26:19.405 --> 26:21.646
this medicine bottle
with my fingerprints on it...

26:21.766 --> 26:25.408
and I guarantee you, David will
drop out of the race.

26:25.488 --> 26:29.690
The party will be thrown into turmoil,
and nobody... I mean nobody...

26:29.770 --> 26:31.611
will be able to touch you come November.

26:40.095 --> 26:42.336
And for all of this?

26:43.977 --> 26:47.739
You'll put me on the White House staff.

26:49.620 --> 26:52.461
Well, nothing so high that it will raise
too many eyebrows, but...

26:52.581 --> 26:57.464
All of this for you to be
a midlevel staffer in my administration?

27:06.268 --> 27:10.150
You and I both know that it would be
a little more than that.

27:25.037 --> 27:27.798
It's been revised now that
the exposure rate has changed.

27:27.918 --> 27:31.200
So you're saying the casualty estimates
have been projected upward?

27:31.320 --> 27:34.322
- Yes, sir. I'm afraid so.
- By a factor of how many?

27:34.442 --> 27:37.363
Now that the virus is out of the hotel
and not completely contained...

27:37.523 --> 27:39.884
it could be as high as times five, sir.

27:39.964 --> 27:43.886
All right. Thanks, Dan. Keep me posted.

27:44.046 --> 27:46.207
- Yes, sir.
- What is it?

27:46.287 --> 27:50.449
I just got off the phone with one of
my sources over at Keeler's headquarters.

27:50.529 --> 27:55.252
Sherry was there,
meeting privately with Keeler.

27:55.372 --> 27:57.413
- When?
- Just now.

28:01.655 --> 28:05.777
- Meeting Keeler about what?
- He didn't know, David.

28:05.897 --> 28:08.178
So I was hoping
you'd have some idea.

28:10.139 --> 28:13.461
I don't know what she's doing,
but we can't worry about that now.

28:13.581 --> 28:17.383
- There are people dying here in Los Angeles.
- Well, I don't like it, David.

28:17.503 --> 28:20.784
So let me put someone on this.

28:22.865 --> 28:25.186
No.

28:25.266 --> 28:29.068
I brought Sherry in to fix a problem,
and look what happened.

28:31.029 --> 28:34.631
Just let it be.
We'll hear soon enough.

28:40.354 --> 28:42.835
What do you see?

28:42.995 --> 28:46.277
They're trying to use
open phone switches to find us.

28:46.397 --> 28:48.918
The phone I called in with is shut off.

28:49.038 --> 28:52.480
They can't triangulate me... can they?

28:52.600 --> 28:57.762
Not quickly, but they can use a trial and
error process, and that could get 'em close.

28:58.963 --> 29:01.684
- That's what they're doing?
- Looks like it.

29:01.804 --> 29:04.165
Then we have to stop them.

29:05.646 --> 29:07.527
Come with me.

29:25.696 --> 29:27.177
Sit down.

29:29.378 --> 29:34.140
Your office is using
our last phone conversation to locate us.

29:34.260 --> 29:38.822
How are they doing it? I'm committed to
getting my daughter back.

29:38.902 --> 29:41.824
You kill me and that'll never happen.

29:41.944 --> 29:44.105
That's not the only option.

29:47.387 --> 29:49.548
You're an attractive woman.

29:51.869 --> 29:57.031
I'm guessing your husband would prefer
you returned without... disfigurement.

29:57.151 --> 29:59.512
I'm not telling you anything.

30:03.314 --> 30:06.076
I have to talk with Almeida.

30:09.157 --> 30:11.198
Keep your conversation short.

30:14.280 --> 30:16.961
- Almeida.
- Let me paint you a picture.

30:17.041 --> 30:20.803
I have a sharp knife, the tip of which is
drawing blood from your wife's face...

30:20.923 --> 30:23.764
right now.

30:23.844 --> 30:27.486
If whatever you're doing to trace these
phone calls doesn't stop in 30 seconds...

30:27.606 --> 30:30.608
she'll be unrecognizable.

30:46.335 --> 30:48.576
- O'Brian.
- Shut down the trace.

30:48.696 --> 30:50.577
Shut it down?
I'm just starting to get something.

30:50.657 --> 30:53.379
- Do it now, Chloe.
- Fine.

30:53.459 --> 30:56.660
- Let me at least see if I can
unscramble the audio.
- I need you to hold off.

30:56.740 --> 31:00.062
This doesn't make sense, Tony.
I thought you wanted me to find Saunders.

31:00.182 --> 31:03.103
I do. Just...
I'll explain it to you later.

31:03.224 --> 31:06.385
- What are you doing?
- I'm trying to pick up a thread on Saunders.

31:06.505 --> 31:08.466
Somebody in my own group
may be working against us.

31:08.586 --> 31:11.828
I have quarantine zones springing up all
over the place. I'm treading water here, Jack.

31:11.908 --> 31:14.429
Why are you lying to me?

31:15.950 --> 31:18.791
- Lying? What are you talking about?
- I just got off with Hammond.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.112
You didn't have a status call scheduled.

31:22.753 --> 31:24.914
I screwed up earlier.

31:25.034 --> 31:27.395
The sat transmission on my system
was forged by my own people.

31:27.475 --> 31:30.437
I should've noticed that it wasn't authentic
before I ordered Baker off his post.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.718
I didn't. By the time I realized
my mistake, it was too late.

31:33.798 --> 31:36.800
- Saunders was gone.
- What about the missing frames?

31:36.920 --> 31:39.801
They must have been deleted by the same person
who forged the sat transmission.

31:39.921 --> 31:41.762
I know this is big, Jack...

31:41.842 --> 31:44.804
and I promise you
I'll offer my resignation when today is over.

31:44.924 --> 31:48.206
- Right now we got too much
going on for me to step down.
- Making a mistake is one thing.

31:48.366 --> 31:50.327
Covering it up is another.
I can't let you stay in place.

31:50.447 --> 31:53.768
- I am taking over command of C.T.U. Now.
- I made a mistake, Jack.

31:53.888 --> 31:56.890
No, Tony. You made two.

31:59.371 --> 32:02.212
Fine.

32:02.292 --> 32:05.254
I'll make sure Adam sends over
everything I got to your group.

32:27.105 --> 32:30.746
Tony, I narrowed down the list.

32:30.866 --> 32:34.428
- What list?
- The list of people on your team
who can't account for...

32:34.548 --> 32:36.749
their time
when the sat frames went missing.

32:36.829 --> 32:39.030
- Oh, yeah. Right. Um...
- Tony, it's very likely...

32:39.150 --> 32:42.112
that someone on this list is working from
within C.T.U. to help Saunders.

32:43.472 --> 32:46.674
Look, Adam, I'm not in charge
of C.T.U. Anymore.

32:46.794 --> 32:48.715
What are you talking about?

32:48.835 --> 32:52.077
Jack and I decided it'd
be best if he took over.

32:52.197 --> 32:54.878
Why don't you send that list
over to him, all right?

33:13.487 --> 33:15.888
- Yes?
- I got a problem.

33:16.008 --> 33:19.250
- What problem?
- Jack Bauer just relieved me of my command.

33:19.330 --> 33:24.212
- Why did he do that?
- He found out I'd deleted
those satellite frames.

33:24.372 --> 33:27.334
- Does he know about our communication?
- No. Not yet.

33:27.454 --> 33:30.455
He thinks I'm just covering my mistake.
He's gonna find out soon.

33:30.575 --> 33:33.737
Then I suggest you get my daughter
out of there before he does.

33:33.817 --> 33:36.178
Look, I might not be able to do this.

33:36.298 --> 33:39.380
- I no longer have any authority at C.T.U.
- You don't need authority.

33:39.460 --> 33:43.222
You just need to know that if you don't
deliver Jane... for whatever reason...

33:43.382 --> 33:45.983
your wife will die,
just like Ryan Chappelle died.

33:46.103 --> 33:49.265
Just like the people at
the Chandler Plaza Hotel died.

33:49.345 --> 33:51.706
I'm gonna try to get her out.
But if I can't...

33:51.826 --> 33:55.668
If you can't, Michelle dies.

33:55.788 --> 33:58.829
Don't call me again
until you have Jane safely away.

34:17.237 --> 34:20.880
- Dad.
- Kim, I need you to
help me with something.

34:20.960 --> 34:24.402
You're gonna have to clear it with Tony.
He wants me to debrief with Rae Placheki...

34:24.522 --> 34:26.882
- about what's going on with Jane Saunders.
- Tony just stepped down.

34:27.003 --> 34:29.684
I'm acting director of C.T.U.
Until further notice.

34:29.764 --> 34:32.565
What do you mean Tony stepped down?

34:32.646 --> 34:36.328
Tony's hiding something from me.
I need you to help me find out what it is.

34:36.447 --> 34:38.809
- Why me?
- 'Cause right now, I don't know who to trust.

34:38.929 --> 34:42.170
I need you to maintain a surveillance
on every station here at C.T.U.

34:42.290 --> 34:45.452
Anyone who checks in or out.
I also want you to track communications...

34:45.532 --> 34:48.092
- that flag higher than a code two.
- Where do you want me to do this?

34:48.253 --> 34:50.134
Field Ops. Come on.

34:50.254 --> 34:52.576
Thanks.

35:02.300 --> 35:07.103
Almeida.

35:07.263 --> 35:09.624
- "Good news, Tony."
- What is it?

35:09.704 --> 35:13.186
I found a way to pull the voice track on
the phone call you had with Saunders.

35:13.306 --> 35:16.147
- Have you listened to it yet?
- No. The algorithm's still running.

35:16.267 --> 35:20.389
Once that's complete, I'll be able to do an
analysis on the ambient sound and room tone.

35:20.509 --> 35:24.751
All right, um, good work.

35:43.360 --> 35:46.042
Adam, I want you to send your
volumes up to Kim's computer.

35:46.122 --> 35:48.203
- I have her checking something for me.
- Okay.

35:48.323 --> 35:51.204
- Is Chloe still in Tech 1?
- As far as I know she is.

35:51.284 --> 35:54.766
- Have her come up to my office.
I need to speak with her.
- Okay, I will, Jack.

35:59.168 --> 36:01.929
Kaufman.

36:02.009 --> 36:05.491
Yeah, Adam. I'm on the line with Chloe.
We need the password to Etudes Four.

36:05.611 --> 36:07.452
Okay.

36:09.653 --> 36:12.094
- "It's B-C-F-1-9."
- All right. Thanks.

36:12.214 --> 36:14.976
Uh, Tony, Jack needs to see Chloe
in his office right away.

36:15.056 --> 36:17.097
- All right. I'll tell her.
- Thank you.

36:30.103 --> 36:32.904
- " Where is she?"
- She's here.

36:33.025 --> 36:35.786
- Put her on.
- "No."

36:35.866 --> 36:37.707
You have my wife.
I want to talk to her first.

36:41.149 --> 36:43.109
You have my wife.
I want to talk to her first.

36:43.230 --> 36:45.391
"You have my wife"?

36:48.512 --> 36:52.394
Hello? Hello?

36:54.035 --> 36:56.956
Damn it.

37:06.041 --> 37:09.482
Help! Somebody help! I'm locked in.

37:09.602 --> 37:12.964
Tech 1. I'm locked in!

37:28.372 --> 37:32.694
Just hold on for a second.
Everybody, can I have your attention?

37:32.814 --> 37:35.295
Just stop working for a second.
I need your attention.

37:37.136 --> 37:39.817
From this point forward,
I am taking command of C. T.U.

37:39.897 --> 37:42.418
That includes Field Ops
and all communications.

37:42.538 --> 37:45.820
Tony Almeida has stepped down.
He is no longer in charge.

37:49.102 --> 37:51.983
I'm taking Jane Saunders to Division.
Here's the order.

37:52.143 --> 37:55.825
I don't have time to go into details, 'cause
we have to focus on finding Stephen Saunders.

37:55.945 --> 37:59.507
Come on, Pete. This is the order right here.
If you don't believe me, call Division.

37:59.627 --> 38:02.668
So unless you are working directly with
N.H.S. In defining the quarantine zones...

38:02.788 --> 38:04.429
I need you to get involved.

38:09.472 --> 38:11.553
Check with your superiors;
they'll hand out your assignments.

38:11.673 --> 38:14.034
We need to find this guy... now.

38:22.678 --> 38:24.839
- We're leaving right now.
- Okay.

38:24.919 --> 38:26.800
We're going out this way here.

38:35.604 --> 38:38.926
Chase, Chloe hasn't refreshed her
Krone tables in over 15 minutes.

38:39.046 --> 38:41.727
- "I thought she was working on the main system?"
- Yeah. She was.

38:41.847 --> 38:44.209
That's weird.

38:44.289 --> 38:46.690
She never forgets to do that.

38:46.810 --> 38:49.691
- What's going on?
- Have you seen Chloe?

38:49.811 --> 38:53.053
- Yeah, she's over in Tech 1.
- Where are all the guards?

38:53.173 --> 38:55.054
We don't need those guards anymore.

38:55.134 --> 38:57.655
Why not? I thought you were worried about
my father sending men to get me.

38:57.775 --> 39:00.256
We have agents on the streets.
Don't worry about it.

39:06.780 --> 39:09.781
- Kim, why can't I get a feed on Tech 1?
- Hang on.

39:11.542 --> 39:14.543
- Someone blocked it.
- We have a hostile inside.

39:14.663 --> 39:17.665
- Override the access code now.
- Security, I need a 20 on Chloe O'Brian.

39:17.785 --> 39:20.026
Priority one sweep of the entire building.

39:26.389 --> 39:29.231
Cover the back entrance.

39:34.153 --> 39:37.635
- Jack...
- Chloe, step away from the computer. Now!

39:37.755 --> 39:40.476
Tony locked me in here.
Saunders has Michelle.

39:40.596 --> 39:43.878
- "He's using her as leverage"
to get his daughter out.
- Don't move.

39:46.479 --> 39:49.841
Security, this is Jack Bauer.
I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

39:49.961 --> 39:54.123
I repeat, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

39:54.243 --> 39:57.484
Negative, Jack.
He's not on any of the monitors.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.485
- When did he lock you in here?
- About 10 minutes ago.

40:07.369 --> 40:09.450
- Have security lock down the entire building.
- "Yes, sir."

40:09.570 --> 40:11.651
Adam, I want every sat
within range trained on us.

40:11.771 --> 40:14.293
I want to know everything that's exiting
this building. Who's watching Jane Saunders?

40:14.413 --> 40:17.854
- Both guards are down. She's gone.
- Tony.

40:25.458 --> 40:28.179
Exit security, I need a 20 on Tony Almeida.

40:28.259 --> 40:30.581
We do not see him.

40:33.662 --> 40:36.944
This is Almeida. We're out. I've got her.

40:37.064 --> 40:39.865
- How long until satellite finds you?
- About 30 minutes.

40:39.945 --> 40:42.947
I'll give you further instructions
in 20 minutes.

40:43.067 --> 40:45.828
Be at the northeast corner
ofTaylor and Vine.

40:45.908 --> 40:48.269
Yeah, right.

40:57.834 --> 41:00.595
- Yes, sir?
- President Palmer.

41:00.715 --> 41:03.397
I need to speak with him... in person.

41:10.520 --> 41:12.601
Son of a bitch.
