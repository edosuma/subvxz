00:12.500 --> 00:14.060
Louisa Raposa, their spokesperson.

00:14.260 --> 00:15.660
- Welcome to Canada.
- Thank you.

00:16.260 --> 00:17.660
Aye-aye-aye-aye.

00:19.540 --> 00:21.540
Severe anticoagulation syndrome.

00:21.540 --> 00:23.780
- What causes it?
- We don't know.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.940
All right, why don't you two
pack your bag?

00:30.340 --> 00:31.580
Aw, fuck! Fuck!

00:32.180 --> 00:34.220
Mosquitoes can cause
anticoagulation.

00:34.740 --> 00:38.340
Malaria, she kills over 2 million people
a year in Africa alone.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.100
And the mosquito inserts the parasite

00:41.260 --> 00:43.700
along with anticoagulation saliva
into the human.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.940
Carlos, that has been
genetically engineered.

00:47.140 --> 00:48.020
What? No.

00:52.980 --> 00:54.100
We got a Reimer.

00:54.300 --> 00:55.220
Really?

00:55.620 --> 00:57.660
Uh-huh. It's amazing.
No bigger than a bar fridge,

00:57.820 --> 00:59.180
it turns salt water, human waste,
anything,

00:59.340 --> 01:00.860
into pure drinking water.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.380
- Except it has a flaw.
- Exactly.

01:02.740 --> 01:04.580
What about something your body
wouldn't recognize?

01:04.739 --> 01:06.620
An imposter. A Trojan horse.

01:06.820 --> 01:09.660
...bacteriophage, which is a virus
so it multiplies.

01:09.900 --> 01:10.940
Pretty soon,

01:11.540 --> 01:13.340
one becomes a million

01:13.500 --> 01:14.940
and eventually they bust out.

01:15.020 --> 01:16.180
Do you think this could be it?

01:17.260 --> 01:19.500
Bob, you're a genius.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.020
1x11- The Promise

02:47.380 --> 02:48.820
And don't you put this on my team!

02:48.940 --> 02:50.740
We told you to close this
border a day and a half ago,

02:50.860 --> 02:52.220
now the whole thing's out of control!

02:52.980 --> 02:54.060
This is fucking bullshit.

02:54.700 --> 02:56.260
- Jill, you got the numbers?
- Yeah.

02:56.660 --> 02:58.700
Why isn't the Windsor/Detroit
tunnel sealed?

02:59.220 --> 03:01.540
And where are those National
Guardsmen from Lansing?

03:01.660 --> 03:03.860
We're not sure. The trucks were diverted,
that's all I know right now.

03:03.980 --> 03:04.940
Diverted?

03:05.260 --> 03:06.620
- Who gave that order?
- The medical corp.

03:06.900 --> 03:08.860
- They're all sick.
- Wait, they were inoculated!

03:09.180 --> 03:10.100
Not my department.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.340
David...

03:18.180 --> 03:21.260
antigens, ELISA test, PCRs
all confirm the Variola Major.

03:21.580 --> 03:23.860
Well, we knew it was smallpox
two days ago when we started this.

03:24.020 --> 03:25.180
Well, now we have confirmation.

03:25.300 --> 03:27.900
Yeah, we got National Guardsmen
who were sick and they were inoculated.

03:28.220 --> 03:29.100
With that vaccine?

03:29.260 --> 03:30.940
I don't know. We better put
out a health advisory.

03:31.060 --> 03:31.900
I'll take care of it.

03:34.060 --> 03:35.500
China... China...

03:37.020 --> 03:40.100
China still isn't allowing that
flight in Chicago to land.

03:40.340 --> 03:42.180
If it's filled with suspected smallpox.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.380
Confirmed smallpox.

03:43.700 --> 03:46.140
They're trying to divert it to Guam
but they don't have enough fuel.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.060
Bob, you need to stick to the science,
let these guys handle the logistics.

03:49.180 --> 03:50.980
Yeah, but they can't make it
to Guam. It'll go down.

03:51.300 --> 03:54.300
Hey, Bob. I need you to put a request in
for the smallpox vaccine batches

03:54.500 --> 03:56.100
that were used to inoculate everybody.

03:56.220 --> 03:57.700
- But David!
- All right, now just listen.

03:57.860 --> 04:00.140
We need to know
if they're still alive, all right?

04:00.300 --> 04:00.860
Okay.

04:01.380 --> 04:03.140
- The Canada-U.S. border's been closed.
- Finally!

04:10.380 --> 04:11.260
Mayko!

04:11.900 --> 04:12.780
I need those numbers!

04:12.900 --> 04:13.900
Yeah, hold on a sec!

04:16.420 --> 04:17.220
David!

04:18.019 --> 04:19.260
Over here! Over here!

04:20.620 --> 04:23.180
Now they're thinking
the terrorists botched the whole thing

04:23.300 --> 04:25.100
to screw us up at the border.

04:25.300 --> 04:27.940
20,000 dead and now it's a diversion?
What the hell do they have in mind?

04:28.060 --> 04:29.220
- Number! Numbers! Numbers!
- Okay, okay!

04:29.380 --> 04:32.420
This reflects the data from
the samples out of Windsor.

04:32.700 --> 04:34.420
- This is good, this is good.
- What good?

04:34.620 --> 04:36.780
Hemorrhagics over the last 24 hours.
Move, get out of here.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.260
Fuck, what the hell?

04:41.460 --> 04:43.140
- What are you looking for?
- The military numbers!

04:43.260 --> 04:45.860
I need to know how many people were
on the front line who were inoculated.

04:48.660 --> 04:49.420
Go back.

04:49.540 --> 04:50.500
- David.
- Yeah?

04:52.900 --> 04:54.660
- You were right. Hemorrhagics.
- Yeah?

04:54.820 --> 04:55.460
Yeah.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.420
Jesus Christ.

05:36.260 --> 05:38.940
Sometimes I amaze even myself.

05:41.420 --> 05:43.780
Report out of Flint.
Fifty marines are seriously ill.

05:43.940 --> 05:44.700
Pox?

05:44.860 --> 05:45.860
- No, they're bleeding.
- Sure.

05:46.060 --> 05:46.820
Sure?

05:46.980 --> 05:49.980
Where are the 2 million inoculations
we're expecting from the U.K.?

05:50.100 --> 05:51.500
They're still sitting
on a tarmac in London.

05:51.660 --> 05:53.140
The Brits are getting a little jittery
about releasing them.

05:53.260 --> 05:54.940
- What the hell for?
- Because they're starting to think

05:55.020 --> 05:56.380
they might need the
inoculations themselves.

05:56.540 --> 05:57.620
Oh, they're going to need
more than that.

05:57.780 --> 06:00.100
The President ordered inoculations
for every man, woman and child!

06:00.260 --> 06:02.860
Yeah, and I ordered a double
cheeseburger, no onions! Where is it?

06:03.940 --> 06:05.180
Just stick to the science, buddy.

06:05.420 --> 06:06.020
Okay.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.300
- How're you holding up?
- Oh, hey, fine. Listen.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:10.020 --> 06:11.420
Do you like oysters?

06:11.580 --> 06:12.380
The little ones.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.900
Yeah, well I know
this fantastic oyster bar,

06:15.220 --> 06:17.820
it's down in the distillery district.
It's actually... it's right by my loft.

06:18.060 --> 06:19.620
What do you say the two of us
duck out of here,

06:19.820 --> 06:22.780
we pick up a couple of dozen of
Kumamoto oysters, you know,

06:22.980 --> 06:24.860
the little oysters and then
maybe go back to my place

06:25.540 --> 06:27.140
and have a nap.

06:27.860 --> 06:29.100
You interested?

06:29.220 --> 06:30.740
I'm not interested in being
court-martialed.

06:30.940 --> 06:31.780
Oh well, come on.

06:31.980 --> 06:34.660
We're all going to be dead in a couple
of weeks anyway, so who cares?

06:34.860 --> 06:35.860
I've been inoculated.

06:36.020 --> 06:38.900
So have I. That's the problem
Private Rossette.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.180
You see, in a few days there's going
to be vomit coming out one end,

06:42.340 --> 06:44.260
diarrhea coming out the other and well,

06:44.420 --> 06:46.220
blood coming out
of every pore in between,

06:46.340 --> 06:48.260
so there's kind of a time
factor on my offer.

06:48.420 --> 06:50.660
Here, listen. I just got this sweater.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.460
Tell me, do you think it looks better

06:54.100 --> 06:55.980
if it's done up like this.

06:56.540 --> 06:58.620
Or if I just like leave it
open and all sort of sexy?

06:59.180 --> 07:00.740
What are you doing?

07:03.420 --> 07:06.260
Hemorrhagic fever in smallpox.

07:06.900 --> 07:08.060
Game over.

07:14.860 --> 07:15.860
He's got it.

07:23.300 --> 07:27.500
Game terminated. On 8-2 at 17:32 hours
Eastern Standard Time.

07:27.620 --> 07:28.700
Good work, David.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.220
Well, hey, not bad, eh?

07:32.500 --> 07:37.100
Because, what was Atlanta?
It was 5 days, 600,000, and Mexico was?

07:37.380 --> 07:39.020
Four days, close to
a million dead.

07:39.180 --> 07:41.500
- And I got...?
- Two days, 22,000 dead.

07:43.460 --> 07:44.260
Three days!

07:44.500 --> 07:46.380
And 30,000! Wow!

07:46.740 --> 07:48.860
Good work everybody.
Thank you, Weston.

07:50.940 --> 07:52.660
Care to explain your reasoning?

07:52.740 --> 07:54.180
Oh, I thought you'd never ask.

07:54.380 --> 07:57.740
You see, the military boys they did
a pretty good job rushing in to fight

07:57.860 --> 08:00.100
what they thought was
a clear cut smallpox outbreak,

08:00.260 --> 08:02.700
but they didn't really do their homework

08:02.860 --> 08:06.620
because although the smallpox
which infected the inoculated soldiers

08:06.780 --> 08:08.700
was killed
by their heightened antibodies,

08:08.940 --> 08:13.020
there was something lurking
in the bushes. Check it out.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.220
Smallpox, hum?

08:18.660 --> 08:20.380
With a little friend.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.980
The antibodies kill the smallpox

08:23.180 --> 08:24.460
and they release

08:25.020 --> 08:30.420
green monkey disease, aka Marburg fever
hidden behind the smallpox.

08:31.500 --> 08:33.179
I should say actually, it's super-Marburg

08:33.380 --> 08:35.419
because the symptomology was
pretty fucking quick.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.220
That's it.

08:36.380 --> 08:36.900
Oh, that's it.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.539
I mean, you could have contained
the smallpox outbreak,

08:38.700 --> 08:39.860
but in the confusion you managed

08:40.020 --> 08:43.059
to infect thousands of people with
a virus that's right up there with Ebola

08:43.220 --> 08:46.700
released by the very inoculation
that was supposed to be protecting us.

08:47.060 --> 08:49.100
A pretty slick trick, general.

08:50.260 --> 08:51.660
We'll need recommendations.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.140
Well, as I said to Private Rossette here,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.700
my recommendations are to study

08:55.860 --> 09:01.060
and develop a rapid test
for recombinant chimera viruses.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.220
Private Rossette,
would you like to...

09:03.540 --> 09:04.780
- David.
- Not now.

09:04.940 --> 09:06.180
It's about Miranda.

09:07.020 --> 09:08.300
I'll just be a minute.

09:12.020 --> 09:13.300
What's with lover boy?

09:13.460 --> 09:14.460
No comment, general.

09:25.860 --> 09:27.020
How'd it go?

09:27.260 --> 09:28.260
Very well.

09:30.020 --> 09:31.420
Colin Digby, David Sandstrom.

09:32.100 --> 09:32.980
Oh yeah.

09:33.060 --> 09:33.900
MI-5.

09:34.140 --> 09:36.180
MI-5, cool.
That's a nice suit.

09:37.100 --> 09:39.540
Listen, we need to talk.
Our friend Martin Jamieson,

09:39.700 --> 09:41.580
aka William Zanzinger
was found dead in Cape Town.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.460
Well, it is good news. Thank you.

09:43.740 --> 09:44.460
How?

09:44.780 --> 09:46.300
- It appears to be suicide.
- Any other leads?

09:46.500 --> 09:47.540
No, nothing official.

09:47.780 --> 09:50.220
We don't think that Jamieson
created the Miranda virus on his own,

09:50.380 --> 09:52.980
as he was a mercenary. We already had him
linked to illegal arms trading

09:53.100 --> 09:55.820
out of Russia, drugs out of South America
and an incident here in Canada.

09:56.020 --> 09:57.260
What'd he do, kill a seal?

09:57.380 --> 09:59.140
No, he firebombed a Sikh temple.

09:59.740 --> 10:03.060
We also don't think that he committed
suicide, not out of remorse anyway.

10:03.220 --> 10:05.220
- He was most likely murdered.
- Why Cape Town?

10:05.460 --> 10:06.780
Sorry, I beg your pardon?

10:07.060 --> 10:08.980
You said he died in Cape Town.
What was he doing there?

10:09.140 --> 10:10.460
He was running from
British intelligence.

10:10.620 --> 10:13.140
Yeah, but why did he run there?
I mean, why not Papua New Guinea

10:13.260 --> 10:16.740
or Tuktuyuktuk
or some spider hole in Iraq?

10:18.140 --> 10:19.260
We don't know yet.

10:22.580 --> 10:23.500
Okay.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.780
Well, that's good,
right? Helpful? Thank you.

10:28.180 --> 10:30.340
I've just got to wrap up a few things.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.860
So, he's really good
at what he does, yeah?

10:34.100 --> 10:36.540
With science he's brilliant.

10:37.660 --> 10:39.420
The rest I'm not sure.

10:46.220 --> 10:47.100
Hi, Bob.

10:47.780 --> 10:48.980
Hello, Dr. Nathan.

10:49.140 --> 10:50.780
Well hello, Gamelan.

10:52.220 --> 10:53.020
So...

10:53.620 --> 10:56.140
What's the problem, Bob?

10:56.780 --> 10:58.180
Histiocytosis.

10:59.660 --> 11:01.500
You know about histiocytosis?

11:02.460 --> 11:05.620
Histiocytes are a type of
white blood cell also called macrophages

11:05.900 --> 11:08.500
which ordinarily form a part of
a dog's immune system.

11:08.700 --> 11:11.940
Their proper role is to engulf
bacteria and other material

11:12.220 --> 11:14.380
which should not be present in
the body and destroy it.

11:14.540 --> 11:17.980
I thought it might be there,
but I'm not against a second opinion.

11:18.380 --> 11:19.980
How many PhDs do you have now?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.060
Still just two.

11:21.540 --> 11:22.860
We'll need to run some tests.

11:24.060 --> 11:25.260
I already have.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.860
Well, I think we should keep
Gamelan here for a couple of days,

11:30.020 --> 11:32.140
put her on a drip. She's jaundiced.

11:32.340 --> 11:33.700
See, I didn't notice that.

11:34.100 --> 11:36.220
We'll see if we can't get
her red cells up.

11:37.300 --> 11:38.380
X-rays, blood work.

11:39.180 --> 11:39.700
Sure.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.780
I packed a bag for her.

12:01.940 --> 12:04.620
Now, what do you like on
your oysters again?

12:05.340 --> 12:07.020
Mmm, definitely some lemon.

12:07.340 --> 12:09.220
Some lemon, all right.

12:09.380 --> 12:12.100
And let's have a little bit more
of this hot stuff right here.

12:12.460 --> 12:14.180
All right, you want some hot stuff?

12:14.500 --> 12:15.900
Imagine that, nobody's home.

12:16.100 --> 12:16.900
You are.

12:18.580 --> 12:19.700
My turn.

12:58.620 --> 12:59.780
Hey, how's it going?

12:59.980 --> 13:01.300
Oh, bankers hours?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.500
Oyster night.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.660
Hum, got it.

13:03.900 --> 13:08.740
Do you remember a conversation about
some state of the art DNA sequencer?

13:08.940 --> 13:10.100
What, over oysters?

13:10.500 --> 13:12.260
It was back during the
Miranda outbreak.

13:12.420 --> 13:15.420
I'm pretty sure Hira said she heard
there was one in Cape Town, South Africa.

13:15.540 --> 13:16.460
Yeah, so?

13:17.340 --> 13:19.140
Cape Town came up the other day.

13:26.620 --> 13:29.500
Here you go. Bethke Labs,
Cape Town, South Africa.

13:29.780 --> 13:31.100
You ever been there?

13:31.380 --> 13:34.940
A beautiful city, got a mountain
right in the middle of it.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.940
Yeah, we went together, remember?

13:37.220 --> 13:37.780
Oh, right.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.660
Hum, this is weird.

13:43.340 --> 13:45.940
Bethke Labs was destroyed
by a fire a month ago.

13:46.340 --> 13:48.980
Cause unknown, no casualties.
Hold on.

13:49.860 --> 13:52.780
Okay, the examiner called it
an industrial accident.

13:52.980 --> 13:57.220
Cape Daily called it terrorism.
The National called it suspicious.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.380
What is that?

13:59.100 --> 14:00.620
"Because of potential dangers,

14:01.020 --> 14:03.660
biohazard experts
sealed and secured the facility

14:03.980 --> 14:05.340
- pending medical review."
- Thank you.

14:06.420 --> 14:08.140
I'm always glad to help.

14:09.900 --> 14:14.420
Hey, write this down. Bethke Labs...

14:14.580 --> 14:15.860
Cape Town, South Africa.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.260
Tell James Bond to get us
all biohazard samples he can.

14:18.460 --> 14:19.180
Okay, is there anything...

14:19.300 --> 14:19.780
See ya!

14:20.780 --> 14:22.580
- May I?
- Yeah, come in Carlos.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.260
I've been thinking about
your recent scare.

14:25.700 --> 14:28.260
I haven't. There was really
nothing to worry about after all.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.500
That's great, but we can test
for BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.300
The breast cancer genes.

14:34.460 --> 14:37.500
If you have the mutated version,
and there are more errors in replication,

14:37.940 --> 14:39.740
then this can lead to a
cancerous growth.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.860
It's a simple test.
I can do it for you here.

14:42.660 --> 14:45.420
Okay. What happens if I have it?

14:46.060 --> 14:48.980
If you have it, it means
you're predisposed to breast cancer.

14:49.980 --> 14:52.940
The usual recommendation is a
double mastectomy.

14:56.300 --> 14:57.740
Oh...

14:58.460 --> 14:59.820
is that all?

14:59.980 --> 15:01.620
Yes, but Caroline given the information,

15:02.140 --> 15:04.020
before a cancer grows
it can be life saving information.

15:04.180 --> 15:04.780
Yeah.

15:05.780 --> 15:07.620
I'm going to have to think about it.

15:08.340 --> 15:09.020
Okay, good.

15:10.220 --> 15:11.460
But thank you.

15:22.860 --> 15:24.020
Bob?

15:27.780 --> 15:29.780
Bob, what are you doing?

15:33.060 --> 15:33.740
Hey.

15:34.940 --> 15:35.940
Oh, hi.

15:36.660 --> 15:39.340
- What are you still doing here?
- Am I supposed to be somewhere else?

15:39.500 --> 15:40.460
Home.

15:41.820 --> 15:43.300
There's no reason to go home.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.620
My dog's in the hospital.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.100
Gamy,

15:47.980 --> 15:49.540
what's wrong with her?

15:49.660 --> 15:52.940
Gamelan's got garden variety histiocytes
but they're out of control.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.260
I'm sorry, Bob.

15:54.660 --> 15:55.740
They've attached to her organs

15:55.860 --> 15:57.620
instead of doing what
they're supposed to do.

15:57.780 --> 15:58.820
What's the prognosis?

15:59.020 --> 16:00.860
Well, if they've attached
to her liver or her heart,

16:01.020 --> 16:03.820
they can grow as fast as cancer cells
and form lumps.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.540
Do you think Caroline would
let me work on it?

16:08.700 --> 16:11.300
Fuck Caroline.
Do you need any help?

16:22.020 --> 16:23.500
Bob...

16:23.660 --> 16:25.620
Sometimes I think
I know too much.

16:26.140 --> 16:28.780
If I didn't know so much about
histiocytes and receptive furins

16:28.980 --> 16:33.060
and mitosis and meiosis,
mitosis reduction division.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.100
If I didn't know so much

16:35.220 --> 16:37.900
maybe I wouldn't think
that I could save Gamelan.

16:38.060 --> 16:40.300
I could just let her go.

16:41.940 --> 16:44.540
Bob, I'll help you, okay?

16:46.980 --> 16:48.420
Thanks, Mayko.

17:12.660 --> 17:14.020
What is that?

17:14.260 --> 17:17.380
Check it out. Two culminates
orienting away from each other

17:17.700 --> 17:20.140
because of NH3 production.

17:20.540 --> 17:21.980
Aren't you supposed to be working

17:22.099 --> 17:24.940
on a model of a smallpox/Marburg
outbreak in Detroit?

17:25.060 --> 17:26.780
Well, I've got to get
my kicks somewhere.

17:26.980 --> 17:28.099
Now I'm halfway there,

17:28.300 --> 17:30.940
I'm just waiting for some
sequence information from Jill.

17:31.420 --> 17:33.340
I've been waiting forever.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.940
How long does it take to sequence
a fucking smallpox virus?

17:36.060 --> 17:37.140
Hang on a sec.

17:47.660 --> 17:48.620
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.140
How's that theoretical Marburg
coming along?

17:51.380 --> 17:53.660
Oh, well, I tried hitting it
with anti-virals

17:53.940 --> 17:56.820
and cytokines and
human vasoactive agents.

17:57.100 --> 17:58.460
I didn't get anywhere.

17:58.740 --> 18:00.420
Even the smallpox sequencing?

18:02.180 --> 18:03.220
Shit.

18:04.060 --> 18:08.100
Okay, here if you just come for
a second and let me...

18:11.220 --> 18:12.700
Are you all right?

18:13.340 --> 18:15.820
No, I'm a fucking disaster, David.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.060
It started in college, you know,

18:19.900 --> 18:22.380
feeling like I couldn't get enough air,

18:22.660 --> 18:25.060
feeling like I was going
to have a heart attack,

18:25.580 --> 18:28.460
the sweats, the shakes.
Feeling like I'm going to go crazy.

18:29.060 --> 18:30.620
I feel that way everyday.

18:31.580 --> 18:34.180
Look Jill, you're in
a new town, a new job,

18:34.500 --> 18:37.020
your ground breaking experiment just...

18:37.220 --> 18:40.100
- Crashed and burned.
- Yep, you've got a lot of shit going on.

18:40.500 --> 18:41.620
No, I know. I know.

18:41.740 --> 18:43.140
And I've done all this stuff too, David.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.780
Like I've done cognitive

18:44.980 --> 18:47.860
and behavioural therapies,
I was on Venlafaxine for about a year.

18:48.060 --> 18:50.100
- Wow, how did that work for you?
- It helped,

18:50.220 --> 18:53.020
but it made my brain dull.
It killed my sex drive.

18:55.460 --> 18:58.980
Look, I want you to take the
rest of the day off, okay?

18:59.340 --> 19:01.260
You've got to chill.
It's going to be all right.

19:01.460 --> 19:03.340
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be doing this.

19:03.460 --> 19:05.580
Do what? Enjoy the fresh air, relax.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.060
It's okay. I'll handle it.
I've got to get back to work.

19:09.220 --> 19:11.180
- Are you having another one now?
- No, I'm fine.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.900
You know, you made
those same noises that night in Chicago.

19:18.740 --> 19:20.060
Come on, Jill.

19:20.700 --> 19:21.700
I'm fine.

19:49.740 --> 19:50.860
Carlos.

19:51.020 --> 19:51.860
Hum?

19:51.940 --> 19:53.940
Have you ever been
with a women?

19:55.540 --> 19:56.860
Yes I have, Bob.

19:59.220 --> 20:00.380
I haven't.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.780
A handsome guy like yourself?

20:02.900 --> 20:04.500
I'm sure your time will come.

20:04.660 --> 20:06.380
You know I have
Asperger's Syndrome.

20:06.540 --> 20:07.180
Yes, I do.

20:07.620 --> 20:09.500
We show marked deficiencies
in social skills,

20:09.860 --> 20:11.060
difficulties with changes

20:11.380 --> 20:14.100
and often have obsessive
routines and preoccupations.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.060
We have trouble reading
non-verbal cues.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.260
Sometimes we even have difficulties
in language in a social context.

20:19.580 --> 20:22.220
Todos tenemos
una cruz que cargar.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.100
Yeah.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.260
My burden's Gamelan.

20:27.500 --> 20:29.820
Well, she's not a burden.
I love her but...

20:31.340 --> 20:32.860
Gamelan's sick.

20:32.980 --> 20:35.660
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
What's wrong with her?

20:38.220 --> 20:40.940
It makes me too sad to
talk about it.

20:43.980 --> 20:47.340
Okay, I think we're done.
Let's get to the PCRs.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.060
Okay.

20:49.460 --> 20:52.020
Bethke Labs in Cape Town
employed 24 people.

20:52.180 --> 20:54.740
They specialized
in DNA testing and viral arrays,

20:54.980 --> 20:57.740
but all of the employees have been
accounted for and questioned.

20:58.260 --> 20:59.940
It looks like a dead end.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.860
It still sounds familiar.

21:03.300 --> 21:05.740
David, I think you're going
to want to see this.

21:08.340 --> 21:09.860
- How many times did you run it?
- Three.

21:10.420 --> 21:11.460
Let's see it, Bob.

21:12.100 --> 21:13.700
Here are the
other 2 routes.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.540
Fuck me, it's her.

21:20.940 --> 21:21.580
Yup.

21:22.500 --> 21:23.900
I almost died when I saw it.

21:24.940 --> 21:26.060
Miranda.

21:27.540 --> 21:28.820
Wait a minute.

21:30.700 --> 21:31.740
What is that?

21:32.420 --> 21:33.380
We don't know.

21:33.540 --> 21:35.260
It's such a small peak,
almost background.

21:35.500 --> 21:37.020
It may be an error in the
image processing.

21:37.540 --> 21:38.500
Find out.

21:38.660 --> 21:40.500
But I've seen it in a number
of samples now. It must be real.

21:40.660 --> 21:41.940
Find out!

21:43.460 --> 21:45.340
We definitely found Miranda
in the samples.

21:45.460 --> 21:45.940
Okay.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.060
But this other thing out of
the same lab could be the next thing

21:48.180 --> 21:49.740
some sick fuck's going
to throw at us.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.220
What do the mass specs show?

21:51.380 --> 21:53.260
Well, we could be looking at
anything from enteric pathogens

21:53.420 --> 21:54.700
to calisa viruses.

21:54.940 --> 21:57.340
So you want viral DNA and
RNA micro arrays.

21:57.500 --> 21:58.900
I do, from a cleaned up sample.

21:59.060 --> 22:00.780
We just need to reduce
the background.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.260
All right.

22:05.140 --> 22:07.460
You're back on the Venlafaxine?

22:07.580 --> 22:08.300
No.

22:08.580 --> 22:09.900
You're awfully calm.

22:12.340 --> 22:13.540
Thank you.

22:19.660 --> 22:22.620
- It moves faster than Miranda?
- Twice as fast.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.940
Meaning crash out and
destruction of the host is how long?

22:26.460 --> 22:28.980
Say you put it in on a plane
from L.A. to New York,

22:29.260 --> 22:31.380
everybody would be digested
from the inside out

22:31.620 --> 22:33.620
over roughly Trapdoor, Missouri.

22:35.660 --> 22:37.460
And nothing is
slowing it down?

22:38.380 --> 22:41.180
No. Well, there's a test out there that
I want to read up on,

22:41.340 --> 22:44.220
a liposome encapsulated virus.
It slowed things down in monkeys,

22:44.340 --> 22:45.500
and that's all it did.

22:45.660 --> 22:49.620
But I have to finish all the polyclonal
immune sera before I can go there, so...

23:19.500 --> 23:21.780
Here's a picture of it
taken first in 1976,

23:21.980 --> 23:24.500
and that's what we found.

23:29.940 --> 23:32.060
Okay, order some primers and
sequence the whole thing.

23:32.220 --> 23:34.700
We need to find out if somebody
fucked around with it like Miranda.

23:40.460 --> 23:41.820
- Are you ready for this?
- What?

23:41.940 --> 23:44.500
That stuff we scraped off
the vials from the Bethke Lab fire?

23:44.620 --> 23:45.780
Did we find out what it is?

23:45.900 --> 23:47.140
- Marburg.
- Marburg?

23:47.340 --> 23:49.500
Uh-huh, as in war games Marburg.

23:50.180 --> 23:52.060
- Oh, what are you saying?
- You tell me.

23:52.220 --> 23:53.580
It could be just coincidence.

23:53.740 --> 23:56.020
Come on. Miranda and Marburg together.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.780
This doesn't ring any alarm
bells for you, hum?

23:59.300 --> 24:01.020
Look, if Bethke Labs gave us Miranda

24:01.140 --> 24:03.460
and then a bunch of generals
have us running around playing war games

24:03.580 --> 24:06.700
based on the Miranda scenario
but using a Marburg chimera?

24:06.740 --> 24:09.140
Are they acting dumb or
are we just dumber?

24:09.260 --> 24:11.420
- Okay, I'll see what I can find out.
- Me too.

24:11.700 --> 24:12.900
What are you going to do?

24:13.460 --> 24:15.260
I'm going to go look at some art.

24:51.140 --> 24:53.060
Go away, Sacha!

24:53.860 --> 24:55.180
Try again.

24:56.700 --> 25:00.140
The great professor, Dr. Sandstrom.

25:01.260 --> 25:02.580
How are you?

25:08.660 --> 25:10.780
Here, from the motherland.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.980
I get the pickles
and the pickled herring.

25:19.220 --> 25:24.460
But you, you want me
to talk, hum? What about?

25:25.780 --> 25:28.460
The return of figurative art

25:29.220 --> 25:31.780
or the New Baroque?

25:33.860 --> 25:38.140
How about the death of conceptual art?

25:38.500 --> 25:39.900
Marburg.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.340
Have you ever worked with it?

25:50.220 --> 25:54.060
Vascily, we know that
Moscow was working with Marburg

25:54.140 --> 25:56.100
shortly before the wall fell.

25:56.540 --> 25:57.580
So?

25:58.700 --> 25:59.780
So.

26:09.580 --> 26:12.620
The art of science
is much improved.

26:13.980 --> 26:15.500
Very, very good detail.

26:15.780 --> 26:18.740
Yeah, the techs have come a long way.
Do they look familiar?

26:20.740 --> 26:23.500
This is Marburg...

26:26.100 --> 26:27.740
...it's not mine,

26:28.060 --> 26:29.460
it's not Soviet,

26:30.020 --> 26:32.220
it's not even Soviet block.

26:34.220 --> 26:35.620
Are you sure?

26:40.300 --> 26:41.700
We...

26:42.220 --> 26:44.260
we didn't care about

26:45.420 --> 26:49.180
Marburg until '85.

26:50.860 --> 26:53.300
Six years later,
the whole scountry collapsed.

26:55.580 --> 26:59.780
There was no time
for us to weaponize the virus.

27:01.660 --> 27:03.780
Wait a minute,
this is weaponized?

27:03.940 --> 27:04.980
From the sequence,

27:05.140 --> 27:08.860
it looks like they increased
the incubation period of the virus.

27:10.180 --> 27:14.460
So, a person could be walking around
for weeks with this and not even realize it.

27:15.380 --> 27:19.140
A 10 megaton bomb
in a hand grenade.

27:21.460 --> 27:23.380
Do you know whose
work this is?

27:23.900 --> 27:26.740
An artist. A true artist.

27:28.700 --> 27:33.540
Do you know any scientists connected to
a Bethke Lab in Cape Town, South Africa?

27:42.700 --> 27:43.900
David,

27:45.220 --> 27:47.780
you know the reason
I took up art

27:47.980 --> 27:50.980
was to get away from all
this stuff of yours!

27:52.540 --> 27:55.020
I wish I could do the same.

27:55.180 --> 27:57.860
Then why don't you.
Tonight, here, stay, we drink, we drink,

27:57.980 --> 28:01.020
you get drunk,
maybe you buy a painting.

28:02.980 --> 28:03.860
Hey, Carlos.

28:04.500 --> 28:08.900
I wanted to know if you've had a chance
to think about what we talked about?

28:09.100 --> 28:11.300
Yeah, I really haven't had the time.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.900
Uh, Caroline,
it's a simple blood test.

28:17.340 --> 28:20.660
Yeah, a simple blood test that's going
to tell me if my life goes on as usual

28:20.860 --> 28:23.820
or if I have the genes
that will change me forever.

28:24.060 --> 28:27.100
I don't know if I could commit
to a double mastectomy, Carlos.

28:27.460 --> 28:29.140
Caroline, if it would
save your life?

28:29.380 --> 28:31.900
If I was diagnosed and
if I had no choice.

28:32.340 --> 28:34.740
Okay, but that would be
rolling the dice.

28:34.980 --> 28:36.700
- Carlos.
- You know, you can.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.980
My mother died when I was 14.

28:48.180 --> 28:51.020
Her breast cancer
had metastasized all over.

28:52.340 --> 28:56.660
She went into the hospital on
the Friday and died on the Sunday.

28:58.620 --> 29:01.420
My mother never told
me she was sick.

29:01.660 --> 29:03.860
She'd been fighting
cancer for over 2 years,

29:04.060 --> 29:05.860
but she didn't
tell me she was sick.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.420
- I'm sorry.
- No, Carlos, the thing is...

29:09.500 --> 29:11.580
I'm glad she didn't tell me.

29:13.020 --> 29:15.780
It might sound cold I guess,

29:16.260 --> 29:19.420
but I'm glad I didn't know what
my mother was going through.

29:19.900 --> 29:22.740
I wouldn't have known
how to handle it.

29:23.580 --> 29:25.860
I wouldn't have been able
to deal with the inevitable.

29:26.020 --> 29:27.580
My life would have changed so much.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.500
- Look, Caroline you can prevent...
- No, please, Carlos. Please.

29:29.620 --> 29:30.540
You can prevent what happened...

29:30.660 --> 29:32.900
- Carlos! Carlos! Please!
- ...to your mother with a simple blo...

29:33.020 --> 29:34.580
Listen to me!

29:37.580 --> 29:39.660
Maybe some day...

29:40.540 --> 29:42.420
Okay, when I'm ready,

29:42.940 --> 29:44.420
but not today.

29:50.140 --> 29:51.020
Okay.

29:57.860 --> 30:00.140
So, I'm not taking this as bad news.

30:00.340 --> 30:03.260
I mean, it is bad
but we already knew that.

30:04.580 --> 30:08.620
Oh, and I think we're looking at
a polygenic mode of inheritance.

30:11.420 --> 30:14.140
I know you're not hungry but
you should try to eat something.

30:14.260 --> 30:15.860
It's homemade of course.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.380
You know,

30:23.500 --> 30:25.660
remission isn't out of the question

30:25.740 --> 30:28.500
and I think we can fight
the pleural effusion with a transfusion

30:28.620 --> 30:30.020
and then we can...

30:33.900 --> 30:35.860
I'd like to hear you,

30:36.300 --> 30:39.060
hear your feet tapping
around the house,

30:39.580 --> 30:42.100
sbarking when we play Frisbee,
crunching on your food.

30:42.260 --> 30:44.740
I'd like to hear you, Gamelan.

30:46.700 --> 30:48.380
I miss that.

30:50.220 --> 30:52.220
Please get better.

32:01.020 --> 32:01.620
Hey.

32:01.780 --> 32:02.980
Hey. Hey, David!

32:03.140 --> 32:04.900
Do you know an Ivan Havlac?

32:05.060 --> 32:07.500
Havlac, Havlac, I know that name.
Why do I know that name?

32:07.620 --> 32:10.020
Oh, Flames sent him
to New York for Savard, right?

32:10.180 --> 32:11.500
No, that was Jan Havlac.

32:11.740 --> 32:14.100
Ivan Havlac was chief
scientist of Bethke.

32:14.660 --> 32:16.500
About 6 months ago he disappeared.

32:16.740 --> 32:18.460
With a deadly virus?
What the fuck?

32:18.620 --> 32:20.140
We don't know
that for sure.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.220
Well, let's make the
fucking leap, Caroline.

32:22.380 --> 32:24.580
Not only is Havlac missing,
so's his resume.

32:24.700 --> 32:25.700
What are you
talking about?

32:25.860 --> 32:27.100
Neither British nor
South African intelligence

32:27.260 --> 32:29.660
have been able to figure out who he is.

32:30.220 --> 32:32.700
And you think it's not a coincidence
that Jamieson died in South Africa,

32:32.980 --> 32:36.300
Havlac worked for Bethke and
we found Marburg there?

32:36.820 --> 32:39.780
See, you're learning a little science,
I'm learning a little intelligence.

32:39.900 --> 32:43.660
Can you use your science contacts to try
to figure out who this guy really is?

32:43.820 --> 32:45.460
Yeah, if you can use
your contacts.

32:46.020 --> 32:49.300
Caroline, if this Havlac guy
has disappeared with Marburg,

32:49.620 --> 32:52.340
a chimera strain that's looking
deadlier than Zaire ebola

32:52.540 --> 32:55.580
and they've got us playing
games with this shit hidden in smallpox.

32:56.260 --> 32:57.700
What's really going on?

32:58.740 --> 32:59.860
Okay, I'll make some calls.

33:00.220 --> 33:00.820
Good.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.460
Do you still need that
information on Vascyli Popov?

33:05.340 --> 33:08.340
Caroline. Are
you keeping tabs on me?

33:08.540 --> 33:10.740
I promise you're the
only woman in my life.

33:10.980 --> 33:11.740
Yes.

33:11.940 --> 33:15.900
Vascyli Popov is not the first person
I would have gone running to on this thing.

33:16.060 --> 33:19.020
Vascyli Popov is a fucking hero.
He fought against proliferation.

33:19.180 --> 33:21.900
He was a fucking Soviet
germ doctor, David!

33:22.020 --> 33:23.700
And he came West after the wall fell,

33:23.820 --> 33:26.140
and he's helped us track down
a number of Soviet researchers

33:26.260 --> 33:29.020
who were working for nasty governments
and terrorist organizations.

33:29.460 --> 33:32.780
Look, I showed him the Marburg. He
positively confirmed that it was not Soviet.

33:33.300 --> 33:36.460
Carlos! Can you join us
in the war room please!

33:36.980 --> 33:37.980
War room.

33:38.420 --> 33:41.940
We ran tests on the Marburg's protein,
cleavability of the glyco-protein.

33:42.140 --> 33:44.020
Glyco-proteins are conjugated
protein carbohydrates...

33:44.180 --> 33:45.060
It doesn't
matter what they are.

33:45.220 --> 33:46.700
What matters is that we
found a huge jump

33:46.860 --> 33:48.580
from the Marburg that
came out of Africa in '72

33:48.700 --> 33:50.460
to the Marburg
that we're dealing with.

33:50.580 --> 33:51.660
What kind of jump?

33:51.860 --> 33:53.780
Defensive to offensive.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.540
The stuff we scraped off
the vial in Cape Town

33:55.660 --> 33:58.020
wasn't made to study the virus,
it was made to spread it.

33:58.460 --> 33:59.500
It's been weaponized.

33:59.660 --> 34:01.820
Come on guys, we know
the Soviets were stockpiling Marburg.

34:02.100 --> 34:03.060
Not this kind.

34:03.220 --> 34:04.500
- If you believe Borov.
- I do.

34:04.740 --> 34:06.540
Then who else could
have made it?

34:07.580 --> 34:10.500
Only the Americans
in this restructured form.

34:11.100 --> 34:14.900
That would mean Fort Egan,
the most security tight lab in the world.

34:15.179 --> 34:17.980
You're suggesting somebody got
Marburg out of that lab?

34:19.139 --> 34:20.420
It's easy.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.620
You want me to
open it for you?

34:47.739 --> 34:49.060
No, I'll do it.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.699
You sure?

35:10.580 --> 35:11.820
May I?

35:21.220 --> 35:22.220
Nice.

35:22.900 --> 35:23.860
Very nice.

35:24.020 --> 35:25.820
Front page. It's our centre.

35:29.820 --> 35:31.380
My skewering,

35:32.140 --> 35:35.860
in every university
library in the world.

35:44.140 --> 35:46.220
The worst is from
the people that you know.

35:46.340 --> 35:47.980
People that supported
you in the past.

35:48.460 --> 35:49.980
Were they trashing you?

35:50.460 --> 35:52.660
No, no, that's just it. I...

35:53.380 --> 35:57.980
Well, you know you should
just do what I do in these situations.

36:00.180 --> 36:01.580
Fuck 'em.

36:01.940 --> 36:03.260
Fuck 'em all.

36:04.220 --> 36:06.380
No. I can't do that.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.140
David, I mean you don't know
how this feels, right.

36:10.300 --> 36:11.940
I mean, I can't sleep,

36:12.060 --> 36:13.060
I can't stop eating,

36:13.220 --> 36:14.340
no desire for sex.

36:14.500 --> 36:16.740
Well, maybe I could help you
in that department.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.740
Maybe I should just go
back on the meds.

36:18.900 --> 36:20.140
No, listen.
You know what?

36:20.300 --> 36:22.860
You put it out there.
That's what we do.

36:23.020 --> 36:25.540
We do our best work and
we put it out there

36:25.940 --> 36:29.660
and sometimes we win and sometimes
we fall on our collective asses.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.580
We all make mistakes?

36:31.820 --> 36:34.380
- We all...
- Is that what you were going to say?

36:34.900 --> 36:36.260
- Fuck you.
- ...make mistakes. We do.

36:36.420 --> 36:37.580
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

36:37.980 --> 36:38.620
No.

36:38.900 --> 36:42.140
Jill, come on. To err is human.
So, fuck it. What's the big deal?

36:42.900 --> 36:44.460
- It's humiliating.
- Oh, it's humiliating.

36:44.580 --> 36:46.220
A little humiliation
is good for the soul.

36:46.420 --> 36:47.620
No, it's humiliating, David.

36:47.820 --> 36:49.540
And humiliation is
something you can deal with.

36:49.740 --> 36:52.260
- Well, it pisses me off.
- Well, it's in here...

36:53.140 --> 36:55.820
and you've got to get it out there.

36:57.220 --> 36:59.500
I don't understand that.
What do you mean?

36:59.700 --> 37:01.060
I don't know. The point is,

37:01.620 --> 37:04.500
you've just got to be honest
with yourself, right.

37:05.660 --> 37:08.460
You fucked up.
Your paper was a piece of shit.

37:09.620 --> 37:10.420
What?

37:10.660 --> 37:12.460
I mean, you fucked up
on all your protocols.

37:12.620 --> 37:13.780
I fucked up
on one protocol.

37:13.940 --> 37:17.820
That was a protocol that a fucking
grad student would have picked up on.

37:18.020 --> 37:18.460
David!

37:18.620 --> 37:21.380
Come on, you just...
you can't go writing half-assed papers.

37:21.580 --> 37:23.700
I don't write
half-assed papers!

37:23.860 --> 37:28.140
Well, according to the holy Jesus
journal of genetic geniuses, you do.

37:28.700 --> 37:29.820
Right?

37:29.900 --> 37:30.820
They're fucked.

37:31.060 --> 37:32.940
And, what are you going
to do about it?

37:33.100 --> 37:34.740
I'm going to write another paper

37:34.940 --> 37:38.740
and it is going to be so good, and
I am going to blow it up their asses!

37:39.020 --> 37:40.300
- That-a girl.
- Hey! Shut up down there!

37:40.460 --> 37:42.580
You shut the fuck up!

37:43.620 --> 37:45.540
- Uh, that was fun.
- Feeling better?

37:45.700 --> 37:47.500
I'm feeling...

37:47.700 --> 37:49.980
I think I'm feeling
a little better, yes.

37:50.540 --> 37:51.980
Good, all right.

37:53.180 --> 37:54.700
I just want to...

37:54.940 --> 37:56.300
I just want
to check something.

38:05.500 --> 38:09.020
It's not getting better.
I'd better go.

38:13.620 --> 38:14.900
Thank you, David.

38:16.260 --> 38:17.180
Anytime.

38:23.580 --> 38:25.380
I need to
get some answers.

38:25.620 --> 38:28.940
You're talking about stuff
that's way above my pay rate, Caroline.

38:29.100 --> 38:29.900
Oh, come on Des.

38:30.020 --> 38:33.180
I use that line too when
I don't want to talk about the truth.

38:33.380 --> 38:37.820
If the U.S. military made this strain of
Marburg, they can help us break it down.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.020
We need their help, not their bafflegab.

38:41.380 --> 38:42.980
Fort Egan worked on Marburg,

38:43.540 --> 38:47.260
but they systemically destroyed
all their germ stockpiles in 1970.

38:47.660 --> 38:49.020
It took 3 years.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.380
And was Marburg
one of their stockpiles?

38:54.820 --> 38:56.100
All right,

38:56.460 --> 38:58.460
I'm going to go back
to the people I work with

38:58.660 --> 39:00.740
and tell them that this thing
came from Fort Egan.

39:00.900 --> 39:03.780
That my information came from
an unimpeachable source.

39:03.980 --> 39:07.220
If you have a problem with that,
tell me before I get to three.

39:12.660 --> 39:13.740
Okay.

39:15.140 --> 39:16.100
Okay.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.740
Thanks, Des.

39:30.340 --> 39:33.020
If Fort Egan worked on Marburg,
why aren't they working with us?

39:33.140 --> 39:35.420
Egan systematically destroyed
their germ stockpiles

39:35.580 --> 39:38.100
over a 3 year period beginning in 1970.

39:38.260 --> 39:39.460
But not all of them.

39:39.580 --> 39:41.220
They destroyed their
weaponized germ stockpiles,

39:41.380 --> 39:43.620
but didn't slow down
defensive research one bit.

39:43.780 --> 39:46.460
Yeah, defensive research
against bio-warfare and bio-terrorism.

39:46.580 --> 39:47.980
But they have a sample.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.140
Caroline, they created
the worst bio-agents known to humanity

39:51.300 --> 39:54.460
so that they could figure out a way
to defend themselves against it.

39:54.780 --> 39:56.060
That's the American way.

39:56.380 --> 39:57.380
And the Russian,

39:57.540 --> 40:00.220
Pakistani, French, North Korean.
Where are you going?

40:00.940 --> 40:02.220
Back to the well.

40:22.260 --> 40:26.900
David Sandstrom,
I didn't know you were such an art slut.

40:27.420 --> 40:29.500
I didn't know you...

40:30.580 --> 40:32.100
drew figures.

40:33.340 --> 40:35.980
I use Sacha for inspiration.

40:38.260 --> 40:39.340
Can we talk?

40:39.500 --> 40:40.260
Sure.

40:40.500 --> 40:42.140
What about the girl?

40:42.420 --> 40:46.500
Oh, da da da, she can only speak
Ukrainian, Russian, Polish.

40:49.620 --> 40:52.580
It would be a great
shame to ask her to leave.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.580
We think the Marburg came
out of Fort Egan.

40:56.780 --> 41:01.900
I wonder why other artists
don't use nude models, eh.

41:02.340 --> 41:04.700
Poets, playwrights, novelists,

41:04.820 --> 41:08.180
I think it would improve
things for them, don't you?

41:09.940 --> 41:12.500
Have you got any
paintings for sale, Vascyli?

41:12.660 --> 41:15.820
The Louvre is coming
tomorrow to take the lot,

41:16.020 --> 41:19.420
but until then
they are all available.

41:24.980 --> 41:27.100
How much for this one?

41:28.620 --> 41:30.220
What can you pay?

41:30.900 --> 41:32.860
How about $5,000?

41:38.420 --> 41:39.500
And where are you going?

41:39.740 --> 41:40.860
Back to the well.

41:44.620 --> 41:45.940
And where are you going?

41:57.100 --> 41:57.660
Hiya.

41:57.780 --> 41:58.380
Hi.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.020
- Want to sit down?
- Yeah.

42:04.260 --> 42:05.380
- Confirmation?
- Yes.

42:06.260 --> 42:07.340
Absolutely.

42:07.460 --> 42:08.980
Let's not split hairs.

42:09.420 --> 42:12.260
Well, I really can't tell
you anything more then, can I?

42:12.340 --> 42:15.420
Okay, look. We got Marburg
out of the lab in Cape Town.

42:15.780 --> 42:18.460
The Miranda virus
originated out of that same lab,

42:18.620 --> 42:20.420
and the Marburg looks American.

42:21.380 --> 42:22.740
You don't look surprised.

42:22.820 --> 42:25.820
You're really going places you shouldn't
be going right now, you know that?

42:25.940 --> 42:28.700
My job is to advise 3 countries
on threats to our biological safety.

42:28.860 --> 42:31.340
Right now, one of those countries
may be the biggest threat.

42:31.460 --> 42:32.220
Caroline, please.

42:32.420 --> 42:33.700
Colin, tell me.

42:34.020 --> 42:36.060
Let me do my job.

42:37.180 --> 42:40.900
The whisperers among my
colleagues were just deafening.

42:41.460 --> 42:45.860
Of course we heard that security
at Fort Egan had been compromised.

42:46.020 --> 42:48.340
We didn't hear about
the theft until later.

42:49.140 --> 42:50.180
Who?

42:50.460 --> 42:52.380
Who took the viruses?

42:55.620 --> 42:59.660
What's more interesting
is where they ended up.

43:00.940 --> 43:02.660
Why were there stockpiles
in the first place?

43:02.820 --> 43:04.740
- Caroline, please.
- Was it strictly defensive?

43:04.940 --> 43:05.580
Shit.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.180
Look, you know how easy it is
to blur the line

43:07.300 --> 43:09.580
between offensive and defensive
research. Come on.

43:09.740 --> 43:11.140
What was that
war game all about?

43:11.260 --> 43:12.620
Just what it was.
A war game.

43:12.860 --> 43:14.940
So, it's just a coincidence
that we found a strain of Marburg

43:15.100 --> 43:16.980
and the Miranda virus
in the same place.

43:17.100 --> 43:19.460
They ended up in
the hands of a madman.

43:19.580 --> 43:22.340
- Havlac in South Africa.
- Only if he changed his name.

43:23.100 --> 43:26.700
The man who ended up
with the viruses from Egan

43:27.740 --> 43:32.300
was a Van Chiernegin
MD. PhD F-U-C-K.

43:32.620 --> 43:35.420
He was head of germ warfare
research for the Soviets, wasn't he?

43:36.300 --> 43:38.180
My beloved boss.

43:38.340 --> 43:40.220
It was dubbed "shotgun marriage".

43:40.620 --> 43:42.820
Even presidents weren't
aware of the program.

43:42.980 --> 43:45.220
Especially after the
compromise at Fort Egan.

43:45.420 --> 43:48.780
It was specifically designed to create
hybrids of hemorrhagic fevers and poxes

43:48.940 --> 43:51.820
so that vaccines could be
created to combat them. Right?

43:52.180 --> 43:53.660
Did they make vaccines?

43:53.780 --> 43:55.540
No, they weren't able
to come up with one.

43:55.700 --> 43:57.460
- Just the bug that could kill us.
- Yeah.

43:59.860 --> 44:01.620
Okay, so Miranda we stopped.

44:02.420 --> 44:06.740
This smallpox Marburg thing.
It wasn't a theoretical exercise, was it?

44:06.980 --> 44:09.740
Of course it was. There's no indication
that the Marburg is out there.

44:09.860 --> 44:11.580
But it could, that's what
they're worried about.

44:11.700 --> 44:14.420
Yeah, that's what they're worried about.
Ever since Jamieson was found murdered,

44:14.580 --> 44:16.820
now there's this thought that
whoever's behind the Miranda virus

44:17.140 --> 44:19.420
he's pointing a loaded gun
right at us again.

44:21.740 --> 44:25.140
After the Cold War
he disappeared for awhile,

44:25.260 --> 44:29.260
when he resurfaced, it was on the payroll
of the Central Intelligence Agency,

44:29.580 --> 44:31.980
and then he turned on
the West with vengeance.

44:32.020 --> 44:32.860
Why?

44:33.300 --> 44:35.700
Oh, what does it matter why?
He's still turning.

44:36.100 --> 44:38.740
So, we should be looking for Chiernegin?
He's the one behind Miranda?

44:39.100 --> 44:42.460
He's behind taking what
came out of Fort Egan

44:42.860 --> 44:45.700
and turning it into something
that's far more deadly

44:45.900 --> 44:48.300
and I'm sure he's not going
to stop there.

44:53.020 --> 44:56.060
I'll get the Chiernegin name
on the radar of every intelligence agency.

44:56.420 --> 44:58.980
Great, I'm going to need all the research
that Fort Egan's got on Marburg.

44:59.100 --> 44:59.980
I'll see what I can do.

45:01.940 --> 45:03.940
- We have a priority 1 alert.
- What?

45:04.500 --> 45:07.220
There's been a SARS-like case
reported in Denver, Colorado.

45:07.340 --> 45:10.140
The local doctors and public
health officials can't identify the virus.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.060
I don't want to sound paranoid,

45:13.220 --> 45:16.860
sbut let's hope to God this isn't coming
from the same guy that gave us Miranda.

45:22.340 --> 45:24.300
Temperature spike's up to 105.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.780
Lungs are 93% filled with fluid.

45:27.500 --> 45:29.220
You ever see a virus
that virulent?

45:29.580 --> 45:30.940
What are you working on?

45:31.260 --> 45:32.980
Malignant Histiocytosis.

45:33.900 --> 45:35.460
Gamelan's been
diagnosed with it.

45:36.380 --> 45:38.140
Do you want to take her home?

45:39.220 --> 45:40.540
I'm so sorry, Bob.

45:43.380 --> 45:44.980
Uh, okay.
You got something?

45:45.100 --> 45:47.340
David, I got confirmation
that Chiernegin is alive.

45:47.540 --> 45:48.540
So, find the fucker.

45:49.860 --> 45:52.540
I've got a big problem.
I need your help.

45:53.140 --> 45:55.620
- This is what came out of Denver?
- That's what you sent.

45:56.780 --> 45:57.340
No, no.

45:57.940 --> 45:58.900
What? Jill?

45:59.900 --> 46:01.180
Jill, what is it?

46:06.740 --> 46:07.620
David.

46:07.780 --> 46:10.380
He was hit by a car. A cab.

46:10.740 --> 46:12.780
He's in the hospital in a coma.

46:13.060 --> 46:14.380
What?
