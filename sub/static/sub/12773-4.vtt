WEBVTT

00:01.972 --> 00:03.565
Someone's willing to pay $5 million

00:03.590 --> 00:05.314
- to capture a beast.
- There's a bounty?

00:05.391 --> 00:07.791
They may be after a beast,
but they do not know it's Vincent.

00:07.793 --> 00:10.361
But I do, I'm at risk now,
too, which is why I'm giving you

00:10.463 --> 00:12.530
the full resources of Homeland Security.

00:12.631 --> 00:14.999
You don't work at NYPD
anymore, you work for me now.

00:15.100 --> 00:17.465
I don't want you to think
that my turning down tenure

00:17.612 --> 00:19.504
has anything to do with
wanting to move in with you.

00:19.605 --> 00:21.706
But it does, JT, it has
everything to do with it.

00:21.807 --> 00:24.142
It would be so
stupid to take the next step

00:24.243 --> 00:25.977
without you finding what...

00:26.078 --> 00:27.758
whatever the hell it
is you're looking for.

00:27.847 --> 00:29.131
I mean, we're no closer

00:29.132 --> 00:30.801
to finding whoever's put up this bounty

00:30.850 --> 00:32.784
than when we first got
back from our honeymoon.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.503 --> 00:51.769
Sorry.

00:51.871 --> 00:53.738
He's a little cranky this morning.

00:53.839 --> 00:55.373
Who isn't?

00:57.710 --> 00:59.444
Cat, hey!

00:59.545 --> 01:01.346
Geez, what, are you working
all the time now?

01:01.447 --> 01:03.748
Lately, yeah, and so is Vincent,

01:03.849 --> 01:07.919
which is probably why he is a no-show.

01:08.020 --> 01:09.860
We were supposed to
have a coffee date together

01:09.889 --> 01:13.625
after his graveyard shift,
but I guess he got hung up again.

01:13.726 --> 01:15.627
Sorry.

01:15.728 --> 01:16.794
More eastbay stuff?

01:16.896 --> 01:18.463
Pig Latin.

01:18.564 --> 01:20.031
Code.

01:20.132 --> 01:22.300
Oh. Oh, yeah, I get it.

01:22.401 --> 01:24.500
Yeah, the sooner we figure out

01:24.501 --> 01:26.371
who put out a bounty on, uh...

01:26.472 --> 01:28.306
- Eastbay.
- Eastbay.

01:28.407 --> 01:30.742
The sooner Vincent and I can
get back to being married.

01:30.843 --> 01:32.210
Well, that'll be nice

01:32.311 --> 01:34.145
considering you guys just got married.

01:34.246 --> 01:35.613
Yeah.

01:37.550 --> 01:39.884
Ugh, I have no idea how
you can concentrate right now.

01:39.985 --> 01:41.286
That would drive me crazy.

01:41.387 --> 01:43.788
Really? It doesn't bother me.

01:43.889 --> 01:47.184
Well, JT and I ought to
have your new office

01:47.326 --> 01:48.092
up and running today, so you can work

01:48.193 --> 01:50.094
in some nice peace and quiet.

01:50.195 --> 01:51.629
I'm so excited to show you.

01:51.730 --> 01:52.931
I'm excited to see it.

01:53.032 --> 01:54.566
Thank you again

01:54.667 --> 01:56.601
for taking the lead on
finding that place for me.

01:56.702 --> 01:59.637
I have just... I have been crazed.

01:59.738 --> 02:01.072
Yeah, no, don't mention it.

02:01.173 --> 02:02.173
I've been having so much fun.

02:02.274 --> 02:03.775
You'll love it. Kyle did.

02:03.876 --> 02:05.510
Kyle?

02:05.611 --> 02:07.512
Okay, Cat, give me a little credit.

02:07.613 --> 02:10.213
All I did was tell him
that you're a DHS agent now

02:10.368 --> 02:12.016
and that you need an
off-site office... that is it.

02:12.117 --> 02:14.452
To find out who's after Vincent.

02:14.553 --> 02:15.687
What if he found out?

02:15.788 --> 02:16.921
Are you out of your mind?

02:17.022 --> 02:18.456
Whoa.

02:18.557 --> 02:20.458
I'm sorry.

02:20.559 --> 02:23.371
Guess I'm just a
little on edge right now,

02:23.568 --> 02:25.282
trying to figure out
who's behind all this

02:25.424 --> 02:26.344
before the next attack.

02:26.365 --> 02:27.999
Cat.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.668
You're burning the candle
at both ends, you and Vincent.

02:30.769 --> 02:32.637
Trying to balance two demanding careers,

02:32.738 --> 02:34.238
a marriage, that.

02:35.107 --> 02:36.307
Something's gotta give.

02:48.621 --> 02:50.955
Ow! Damn it!

02:51.056 --> 02:53.291
This place is useless!

02:53.392 --> 02:55.526
What are you
talking about? This place is amazing.

02:55.628 --> 02:58.363
Where else can you find so
much space, natural light,

02:58.464 --> 02:59.998
a Pilates studio downstairs?

03:00.099 --> 03:01.566
Forget Pilates.

03:01.667 --> 03:04.002
We need more power, amperage, volts.

03:04.103 --> 03:06.650
Look, I don't think you understand,

03:06.791 --> 03:08.640
but Cat's a special agent now, okay?

03:08.741 --> 03:09.784
Yes, I've heard.

03:09.891 --> 03:11.709
Which means she's
gonna have federal access,

03:11.810 --> 03:14.545
which means international databases,
satellite surveillance.

03:14.647 --> 03:17.849
Technology us tech guys
can only dream of having.

03:17.950 --> 03:19.350
I think we need plants in here.

03:19.451 --> 03:20.885
Maybe a ficus?

03:20.986 --> 03:21.886
Or gardenias.

03:21.987 --> 03:22.987
Heather, listen to me.

03:23.088 --> 03:24.689
This place isn't wired

03:24.790 --> 03:26.991
for what Cat's gonna need to
track down the beast buyer.

03:27.092 --> 03:30.328
It's meant for a... clothing designer.

03:30.429 --> 03:31.619
And now it's meant for Cat.

03:31.745 --> 03:34.524
Can't you just bring in,
like, extension cords or something?

03:34.533 --> 03:36.434
Really? Ow!

03:36.535 --> 03:38.970
Perfect.

03:43.942 --> 03:45.243
Bummed about Tess, are we?

03:45.344 --> 03:47.345
No, this isn't about Tess.

03:47.446 --> 03:50.643
It's about trying to stop whoever
wants to capture a beast

03:50.781 --> 03:52.417
before they find out about Vincent.

03:52.518 --> 03:54.198
It's about those
stupid conspiracy bloggers

03:54.286 --> 03:55.720
who are hell-bent on proving

03:55.821 --> 03:57.121
that a beast really exists

03:57.222 --> 03:59.123
despite my best
attempts to discredit them.

03:59.224 --> 04:01.025
- It's about...
- Tess?

04:01.126 --> 04:04.729
Yes, okay, it's about Tess.

04:04.830 --> 04:06.431
This is exactly why I didn't know

04:06.532 --> 04:08.012
how to tell her I turned down tenure.

04:08.067 --> 04:09.567
You followed your heart.

04:09.668 --> 04:11.769
You realized you
didn't want to be a professor

04:11.870 --> 04:12.970
for the rest of your life.

04:13.072 --> 04:14.472
You made a decision, that's all.

04:14.573 --> 04:16.307
One that might have cost me Tess.

04:16.408 --> 04:18.442
Maybe, maybe not.

04:18.543 --> 04:22.480
Look, all relationships go through
changes, JT, challenges.

04:22.581 --> 04:24.248
You know that... look
at Vincent and Cat.

04:24.349 --> 04:26.384
They go through them all the time.

04:26.485 --> 04:28.720
And God knows they're
going through a doozy right now.

04:28.821 --> 04:30.381
Yeah, Cat, look, I can't talk very long.

04:30.389 --> 04:31.756
I got multiple injuries.

04:31.857 --> 04:33.958
Nurse, can you, uh, get
a CT scan, stat, cranial?

04:34.059 --> 04:35.159
How are you holding up?

04:35.260 --> 04:36.894
Well, I didn't expect
to pull a double shift,

04:36.995 --> 04:39.130
but I've taken so much time off lately.

04:39.231 --> 04:41.566
Plus I had to deliver three
babies last night.

04:41.667 --> 04:43.101
Guess that's a record, huh?

04:43.125 --> 04:44.335
There's got to be something in the air.

04:44.436 --> 04:46.904
Well, I'm calling because Deputy
Secretary Hill called me.

04:47.005 --> 04:48.673
It sounded urgent. I'm headed there now.

04:48.774 --> 04:49.876
What, has he got a lead?

04:49.877 --> 04:51.400
He didn't say, but something is up.

04:51.523 --> 04:53.311
He said that
someone might have found out

04:53.412 --> 04:54.779
that he's the one who's
been protecting your secret.

04:54.880 --> 04:56.514
- Another bounty hunter?
- I don't know,

04:56.615 --> 04:57.949
but I'll let you know when I find out.

04:58.050 --> 04:59.450
I miss you.

04:59.551 --> 05:00.852
Yeah, I miss you, too.

05:02.921 --> 05:05.289
Coding, he's coding.

05:08.560 --> 05:10.461
Can I help you?

05:10.562 --> 05:12.630
- Are you Dorothy?
- Yes.

05:12.731 --> 05:14.365
I'm Catherine Chandler, Agent Chandler.

05:14.466 --> 05:16.801
Oh, right, Deputy
Secretary told me about you.

05:16.902 --> 05:18.336
- Welcome to DHS.
- Thank you.

05:18.437 --> 05:20.471
- Uh, is he around?
- No, um...

05:20.572 --> 05:22.039
I don't know where he is, actually.

05:22.141 --> 05:23.175
What do you mean?

05:23.300 --> 05:24.932
I mean he didn't show for work,

05:24.933 --> 05:26.677
which is really unusual.

05:26.779 --> 05:28.513
He called me 20 minutes ago from home.

05:28.614 --> 05:30.181
Told me to meet him
here, he said it was urgent.

05:30.282 --> 05:32.383
- Well...
- Wait.

05:32.484 --> 05:34.919
Where does he live? What's
his address? Hurry.

05:36.622 --> 05:38.055
- There.
- Thank you.

05:38.157 --> 05:39.557
Vincent.

05:39.658 --> 05:41.058
I think they might have found Hill.

05:41.160 --> 05:42.593
I think he might be in trouble.

05:53.772 --> 05:55.640
Come on.

05:55.741 --> 05:58.342
You knew it was a matter of
time before somebody figured it out

05:58.443 --> 06:00.344
that your agent knew who the beast was,

06:00.445 --> 06:02.413
and you had to know, too, right?

06:02.514 --> 06:03.748
Come on!

06:19.998 --> 06:21.432
Let them go.

06:21.533 --> 06:22.667
Hey.

06:22.768 --> 06:24.168
Don't be a hero.

06:24.269 --> 06:27.505
You tell me who it
is, or after I kill you...

06:29.775 --> 06:30.741
I'll kill them, too.

06:31.844 --> 06:33.878
It's gonna be okay.

06:33.979 --> 06:37.215
Five... four...

06:37.316 --> 06:39.183
- Please.
- three...

06:41.153 --> 06:43.221
two...

06:43.322 --> 06:44.822
Drop your weapon.

06:46.358 --> 06:47.725
- Now.
- Not a chance.

06:52.397 --> 06:53.831
Last chance.

07:18.857 --> 07:19.957
You okay?

07:20.058 --> 07:21.826
Yeah. Yeah.

07:21.927 --> 07:23.995
Better than him anyway.

07:24.096 --> 07:27.131
At least we finally got a
chance to see each other.

07:27.387 --> 07:29.200
Yeah.

07:34.916 --> 07:40.765
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

07:43.549 --> 07:45.800
At least we got there
in time to save his life.

07:45.901 --> 07:47.635
Yeah, but we almost didn't, right?

07:47.736 --> 07:48.641
And if we hadn't,

07:48.816 --> 07:51.806
Secretary Hill's whole
family would have been killed.

07:51.907 --> 07:53.207
So what do you guys think?

07:53.308 --> 07:54.575
That was way too close, you know it.

07:54.676 --> 07:56.043
What are we supposed to do?

07:56.145 --> 07:57.879
Even you can't be two places at once.

07:57.980 --> 07:59.213
Speaking of places,

07:59.314 --> 08:01.170
how about this one? Isn't it great?

08:01.305 --> 08:03.251
Yes, it is
wonderful, Heather, thank you.

08:03.352 --> 08:05.720
- Needs more plants.
- Right?!

08:05.821 --> 08:06.988
Did I not say that?

08:08.957 --> 08:09.834
I'll get it.

08:09.835 --> 08:11.771
Vincent, we are
doing the best that we can.

08:11.772 --> 08:13.928
I know, I know, but for nothing else,

08:14.029 --> 08:15.263
this attack on Hill, it proves

08:15.364 --> 08:16.597
that this beast bounty is very real,

08:16.698 --> 08:17.899
and it's getting closer to me.

08:18.000 --> 08:20.101
I know, I am just as
frazzled as you are.

08:20.202 --> 08:21.369
But you're not juggling two jobs.

08:21.470 --> 08:22.960
You know, this is your job.

08:23.085 --> 08:25.579
Are you saying that this
is harder for you than me?

08:25.698 --> 08:27.909
No, I am not saying that, I'm just...

08:28.010 --> 08:29.777
I don't know, we can't keep this up.

08:29.878 --> 08:32.212
You know, we're like two ships
passing in the night.

08:32.313 --> 08:33.614
I thought that was supposed to happen

08:33.715 --> 08:35.249
after years of marriage, not weeks.

08:35.350 --> 08:37.051
Hey, guys, sorry to interrupt,

08:37.152 --> 08:38.285
but, um, it's Secretary Hill's office.

08:38.386 --> 08:39.620
He wants to see you two right away.

08:39.721 --> 08:41.022
Hopefully he's got another lead

08:41.123 --> 08:42.123
- on the bounty hunter.
- Guys.

08:42.224 --> 08:43.758
We got big problems.

08:43.859 --> 08:45.684
Great, now what?

08:45.847 --> 08:47.762
Really? As opposed to
what just happened?

08:47.863 --> 08:50.064
Actually, it's
because of what just happened.

08:50.165 --> 08:51.899
The attack on Hill, it's already news.

08:52.000 --> 08:54.368
More specifically, it's
already all over the blogosphere.

08:54.469 --> 08:55.894
Uh, translation?

08:56.055 --> 08:57.480
Bloggers haven't given up believing

08:57.481 --> 08:59.007
that some sort of beast exists

08:59.141 --> 09:01.501
since the first bounty hunter
attacked after your honeymoon.

09:01.543 --> 09:03.611
Point is that they
were already suspicious

09:03.712 --> 09:06.189
about a DHS cover-up after
Agent Russo was killed,

09:06.337 --> 09:08.045
but now that his
boss was attacked, too...

09:08.209 --> 09:11.150
Now they're even more
convinced that DHS is hiding something.

09:11.186 --> 09:13.421
Okay, I'm
sorry, I don't understand.

09:13.522 --> 09:14.295
What does this mean?

09:14.296 --> 09:16.254
It means that we have to
be even more careful now,

09:16.255 --> 09:18.387
because the bloggers are
gonna do everything they can

09:18.388 --> 09:21.262
- to try and expose...
- Me.

09:21.363 --> 09:23.564
I've actually got an
idea of how to stop them.

09:23.665 --> 09:25.166
It's a little risky, but I guess

09:25.267 --> 09:27.668
if I wanted safe, I would
have agreed to tenure.

09:27.769 --> 09:29.503
Yeah, right
now everything's risky, man.

09:29.605 --> 09:31.005
Do what you can.

09:31.106 --> 09:32.826
Uh, we got to go see Hill,
I'll get the car.

09:32.874 --> 09:33.954
I-I'll get your validation.

09:34.042 --> 09:37.345
This won't go on forever.

09:37.446 --> 09:39.447
Promise?

09:41.850 --> 09:43.851
Okay, you can do this, JT.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.457
Heath, thank you so
much for everything, really.

09:49.558 --> 09:50.680
Oh, sure.

09:50.828 --> 09:53.027
Hey, uh, so, um...

09:53.128 --> 09:55.029
how long have you been pregnant?

09:55.130 --> 09:57.328
Where did you find that?

09:57.462 --> 09:59.033
In your purse, when I went to give you

09:59.134 --> 10:00.468
extra parking validations.

10:00.569 --> 10:02.370
First of all, it's not what you think.

10:02.471 --> 10:05.273
And second, this is none
of your business.

10:05.374 --> 10:07.675
None of my business?
Cat, I'm your sister.

10:07.776 --> 10:09.936
Don't you think that
entitles me to know whether or not

10:09.945 --> 10:11.625
- you're about to deliver a beast baby?
- Shh!

10:11.647 --> 10:13.043
Well, I...

10:13.202 --> 10:15.402
I haven't even gotten to
the question of beast baby yet,

10:15.484 --> 10:17.785
because I don't know if I am pregnant.

10:17.886 --> 10:20.582
- You know, I'm just late... that is all.
- What, you haven't taken it yet?

10:20.583 --> 10:22.690
- Come on, Heather, I have been so busy.
- What, "so busy"?

10:22.791 --> 10:24.325
Too busy to pee? Cat, come on.

10:24.426 --> 10:26.160
The ladies' room is right
across the hallway.

10:26.161 --> 10:26.794
Go take it right now.

10:26.895 --> 10:28.896
No, I have to go figure
out what Hill wants.

10:28.997 --> 10:30.277
Are you just too afraid to know?

10:30.299 --> 10:31.666
No.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.868
Come on, don't be silly.

10:33.969 --> 10:34.969
- Okay.
- Please.

10:35.070 --> 10:36.904
Just... keep this between us.

10:37.005 --> 10:39.073
Of course.

10:47.282 --> 10:48.549
You saved my life.

10:48.650 --> 10:51.018
You saved my family's life.

10:51.119 --> 10:53.856
I, uh, don't know how to thank you.

10:54.246 --> 10:55.923
We're just sorry we
couldn't get there earlier.

10:56.024 --> 10:57.591
How are your wife and daughter doing?

10:57.693 --> 10:59.260
Still scared.

10:59.361 --> 11:00.528
Especially because obviously

11:00.629 --> 11:02.196
I can't say why he attacked.

11:02.297 --> 11:04.498
Part of the job, I guess.

11:04.599 --> 11:05.733
Keeping secrets.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.401
We know all about keeping secrets.

11:07.502 --> 11:10.204
Including the ones that
put our loved ones at risk.

11:10.305 --> 11:11.238
First time for me.

11:11.340 --> 11:12.773
And the last time.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.942
I want to put an end to
this once and for all,

11:15.043 --> 11:16.410
before something like
this happens again.

11:16.511 --> 11:17.945
Believe us, sir, so do we.

11:18.046 --> 11:19.347
But we need to find whoever's

11:19.448 --> 11:20.748
behind this bounty first.

11:20.849 --> 11:22.116
That's why I called you.

11:22.217 --> 11:24.518
After what happened,
I rattled some cages.

11:24.619 --> 11:27.521
Pulled some strings in every division...

11:27.622 --> 11:29.357
and found this guy.

11:29.458 --> 11:31.460
An accountant?

11:31.587 --> 11:33.587
Albert Toland isn't just any accountant.

11:33.662 --> 11:35.196
He's Dmitri Voynov's accountant.

11:35.297 --> 11:36.764
Russian crime boss who's been trying

11:36.865 --> 11:38.699
to elbow his way
into the States for years.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.634
Okay, and why would he want a beast?

11:40.736 --> 11:42.470
Possibly to eliminate the competition,

11:42.571 --> 11:44.138
which would give him a mob monopoly...

11:44.239 --> 11:45.373
unchecked power in New York.

11:45.474 --> 11:47.975
Albert contacted Secret Service.

11:48.076 --> 11:49.477
Said he was getting
scared because Voynov

11:49.578 --> 11:50.945
was becoming more desperate.

11:51.046 --> 11:53.047
Said Voynov was
doubling a certain bounty

11:53.148 --> 11:55.616
and wanted to make sure that Albert
had the funds available.

11:55.717 --> 11:57.451
Okay, does he know
exactly what the bounty's for?

11:57.552 --> 11:58.886
I don't know.

11:58.987 --> 12:00.421
All I know is, he
wants to flip on Voynov,

12:00.522 --> 12:02.423
but only if we can guarantee protection.

12:02.524 --> 12:04.592
This could be the
break we've been looking for.

12:04.693 --> 12:06.060
When can we meet him?

12:06.161 --> 12:07.995
Well, he's afraid Voynov might find out,

12:08.096 --> 12:10.398
so he'll only meet where
there are a lot of people around.

12:10.499 --> 12:11.659
But he knows to look for you.

12:11.733 --> 12:13.300
Where?

12:13.402 --> 12:15.736
Do you, uh, you guys

12:15.837 --> 12:17.838
have any kids by any chance?

12:20.041 --> 12:22.009
Pregnant, seriously?

12:22.110 --> 12:23.577
That's our cover?

12:23.678 --> 12:25.346
Come on, we're meeting this accountant

12:25.447 --> 12:27.581
at his kid's private
school, not a maternity ward.

12:27.682 --> 12:28.845
Well, unless you want to rent a kid,

12:28.846 --> 12:30.785
this is the best cover that
I could come up with.

12:30.886 --> 12:32.046
Besides, it is an open house,

12:32.120 --> 12:33.621
so prospective parents are welcome.

12:33.722 --> 12:35.189
"Prospective parents."

12:35.290 --> 12:36.590
Really, shouldn't you
be showing a little bit

12:36.691 --> 12:38.159
if we want to pull this off?

12:38.260 --> 12:39.693
Actually, first-time
mothers aren't usually showing

12:39.795 --> 12:41.529
until about 12 weeks, so we're good.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.497
Really, when'd you have time
to research that little tidbit?

12:43.598 --> 12:44.832
Oh, you didn't learn that in med school?

12:44.933 --> 12:47.668
Wait, are you mad at me about something?

12:47.769 --> 12:50.304
- No, why?
- I-I don't know.

12:50.405 --> 12:51.939
You just seem a
little sharp with me lately.

12:52.040 --> 12:53.541
We're sharp with each other, Vincent.

12:53.642 --> 12:55.376
We're both under a lot of stress.

12:55.477 --> 12:57.511
Plus, we put our relationship on hold

12:57.612 --> 12:58.973
for all this, and it's not fun.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.380
Yeah, and since our relationship

13:00.419 --> 13:01.566
is what we're trying to get back to,

13:01.707 --> 13:03.984
can you imagine
having a kid on top of that?

13:04.085 --> 13:06.020
- No way.
- You don't, you don't want kids?

13:06.121 --> 13:07.388
I don't know.

13:07.489 --> 13:08.809
We haven't really talked about it.

13:08.824 --> 13:10.724
Wait, wait. We're talking about it now.

13:10.826 --> 13:12.893
Okay, I... I don't know.

13:12.994 --> 13:15.362
I-I can't really see us having
a family right now.

13:15.464 --> 13:18.466
We barely have time for ourselves,
let alone a kid.

13:18.567 --> 13:21.135
And imagine raising a kid in this city.

13:21.236 --> 13:22.803
You know, subways, safety issues,

13:22.904 --> 13:24.138
beast issues.

13:24.239 --> 13:26.240
So, the answer is no. Fine, I get it.

13:26.341 --> 13:28.776
Come on, I-I didn't say that.

13:32.414 --> 13:34.415
All right, let's go to school.

14:00.275 --> 14:01.275
Agent Morrison?

14:01.376 --> 14:02.943
That's me.

14:03.044 --> 14:05.179
Got some I.D. to back that up?

14:13.355 --> 14:14.614
Okay, so what do you want from us?

14:14.656 --> 14:16.624
DHS is concerned.

14:16.725 --> 14:18.559
For your safety.

14:18.660 --> 14:20.261
What do you mean?

14:20.362 --> 14:22.029
Look, if you brought us here

14:22.130 --> 14:25.199
to convince us there's not
some sort of a... beast

14:25.300 --> 14:27.301
roaming the streets, you're
wasting your time.

14:27.402 --> 14:29.803
- We know better.
- Based on what?

14:29.905 --> 14:32.106
Well, based on unsolved crimes,

14:32.207 --> 14:33.307
cover-ups,

14:33.408 --> 14:34.742
maulings,

14:34.843 --> 14:37.711
including one on one of your own agents.

14:37.812 --> 14:39.480
That's the problem with the Internet.

14:39.581 --> 14:41.448
Everybody believes everything.

14:41.550 --> 14:43.951
So... what?

14:44.052 --> 14:45.452
You're saying it's not true?

14:45.554 --> 14:46.787
I'm saying people are getting killed

14:46.888 --> 14:49.089
and DHS doesn't want you to be next.

14:49.190 --> 14:51.592
Is that some sort of a threat?

14:51.693 --> 14:53.060
No, it's a warning.

14:53.161 --> 14:56.130
There are not... what'd
you call them, beasts?

14:56.231 --> 14:57.464
Out there.

14:57.566 --> 14:58.766
But there are terrorists

14:58.867 --> 15:00.587
who are looking for any edge possible.

15:00.745 --> 15:02.770
Which means the more
you make it sound like

15:02.871 --> 15:04.271
something really does exist,

15:04.372 --> 15:05.573
the more you risk ending up

15:05.674 --> 15:06.941
like the first blogger,

15:07.042 --> 15:08.075
who mistakenly thought

15:08.176 --> 15:09.643
that he was onto something, too.

15:09.744 --> 15:10.911
Understand?

15:13.048 --> 15:14.882
Yeah, yeah. We understand.

15:16.451 --> 15:17.751
Good.

15:21.389 --> 15:22.623
Quick!

15:22.724 --> 15:24.725
- Grab the beast!
- Aah!

15:27.629 --> 15:30.052
Preschool goes for two years,

15:30.183 --> 15:32.666
although there is a Mommy and Me class

15:32.767 --> 15:35.002
starting at two years
old, which I highly recommend.

15:35.103 --> 15:36.971
- Wow.
- Two years old, really?

15:37.072 --> 15:37.972
Helps them acclimate.

15:38.073 --> 15:39.273
Plus it gives them a jump

15:39.374 --> 15:41.134
- on the competition.
- Competition?

15:41.209 --> 15:42.443
What, in finger painting?

15:43.378 --> 15:45.112
What? I mean...

15:45.213 --> 15:46.380
do you really have to worry

15:46.481 --> 15:48.001
about those kind of things at, at two?

15:48.083 --> 15:49.149
Yes, actually.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.552
It's smart to get a jump on it now.

15:51.653 --> 15:53.387
- Yeah.
- By the way,

15:53.488 --> 15:55.189
how far along are you, if I may ask?

15:55.290 --> 15:57.958
Uh, I'm not sure actually...

15:58.059 --> 16:00.361
12 weeks. Uh, first-time mothers don't

16:00.462 --> 16:01.729
usually show until 12 weeks.

16:01.830 --> 16:02.963
Vincent's a doctor.

16:03.064 --> 16:04.064
Oh, fantastic!

16:04.165 --> 16:05.132
What's your specialty?

16:05.233 --> 16:07.034
Specialty? Uh, E.R.

16:07.135 --> 16:08.469
Oh.

16:08.570 --> 16:12.306
And you're a Homeland Security agent?

16:12.407 --> 16:13.507
Yeah, that's-that's right.

16:13.608 --> 16:14.842
I just started, actually.

16:14.943 --> 16:16.176
Mm-hmm.

16:17.216 --> 16:20.547
Let me get you a financial
assistance package.

16:20.649 --> 16:22.049
Great.

16:22.150 --> 16:23.684
Financial assistance?

16:23.785 --> 16:25.719
- How much does tuition cost?
- I don't know.

16:25.820 --> 16:27.488
But I'm glad we're just pretending.

16:31.026 --> 16:33.560
God, I'm so not ready for that.

16:33.662 --> 16:36.363
What if I am?

16:41.369 --> 16:44.004
There he is.

16:44.105 --> 16:46.106
- I got to go.
- Okay.

16:52.514 --> 16:54.081
Come on.

16:54.182 --> 16:55.516
Get down!

16:57.318 --> 16:58.385
Go, go! I'll get them.

16:58.486 --> 16:59.753
Come on, let's go.

16:59.854 --> 17:00.888
Let's go, come on. Run!

17:02.624 --> 17:03.624
Just go!

17:13.201 --> 17:14.935
Hey!

17:20.642 --> 17:21.809
What happened?

17:21.910 --> 17:23.077
Where is he?

17:23.178 --> 17:24.877
I don't know! They took him.

17:24.979 --> 17:26.113
What do you want me to do?

17:26.214 --> 17:27.647
I can't track in tear gas.

17:27.749 --> 17:29.249
If Voynov took Albert...

17:29.350 --> 17:30.684
Then we're back to square one.

17:31.519 --> 17:33.752
- Come on.
- Yeah.

17:41.930 --> 17:44.198
Can I get you some water?

17:44.299 --> 17:47.000
Yes, please.

17:47.102 --> 17:48.402
I still don't
understand... why are we here?

17:48.503 --> 17:49.670
Why can't I go home?

17:49.771 --> 17:51.047
What if Albert calls?

17:51.209 --> 17:53.540
Because until we find
out exactly why your husband

17:53.641 --> 17:55.509
was taken, Mrs. Toland, DHS

17:55.610 --> 17:57.845
needs to keep you safe. Have a seat.

17:57.946 --> 18:00.781
- Thanks.
- Um, are you sure

18:00.882 --> 18:02.850
that you don't know anyone
by the name of Dmitri Voynov?

18:02.951 --> 18:04.952
Boys, no jumping on
the furniture, remember?

18:05.053 --> 18:07.254
Do you have any guns in the house?

18:07.355 --> 18:08.622
Yes, we do.

18:08.723 --> 18:10.023
But they are all locked up.

18:10.125 --> 18:11.681
- They are in the gun safe.
- Okay.

18:11.823 --> 18:14.460
You sure you don't know
Dmitri Voynov? From my understanding

18:14.461 --> 18:16.504
- your husband worked for him.
- I've never heard of anyone

18:16.505 --> 18:19.032
with the name Voynov, but
he's traveling abroad a lot.

18:19.134 --> 18:21.768
And we've sort of been in
the divide and conquer mode

18:21.836 --> 18:23.137
ever since the boys were born.

18:24.906 --> 18:26.746
The police are looking
for him, right? And DHS?

18:26.841 --> 18:28.075
Uh, yes, and my husband.

18:28.176 --> 18:29.109
Your husband?

18:29.210 --> 18:30.477
I thought he was a doctor?

18:30.578 --> 18:32.479
Yeah, uh, he is...

18:33.581 --> 18:34.748
Uh-oh!

18:34.849 --> 18:35.783
Riley, Chasen!

18:35.884 --> 18:36.784
What did you just do?

18:36.885 --> 18:37.885
He did it!

18:37.986 --> 18:39.026
It's okay... that was old.

18:39.087 --> 18:40.754
So sorry. I'll pay for it.

18:40.855 --> 18:42.823
No, please, do not worry about it.

18:42.924 --> 18:43.991
Judy?

18:44.092 --> 18:45.893
DHS has reason to believe

18:45.994 --> 18:48.295
that Voynov might've taken your husband.

18:48.396 --> 18:52.299
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.568
No, I don't.

18:54.669 --> 18:58.071
But... I'm not surprised.

18:58.173 --> 18:59.907
Albert and I have slowly...

19:00.008 --> 19:01.241
drifted apart.

19:01.342 --> 19:02.910
Ever since I got pregnant with Chasen.

19:03.011 --> 19:03.911
What do you mean? Why?

19:04.012 --> 19:05.412
Why? Um...

19:05.513 --> 19:07.080
Life just became overwhelming.

19:07.182 --> 19:09.471
Between his job and mine
and the stress of everyday life,

19:09.618 --> 19:12.786
and then you add kids into
the mix... I don't know.

19:12.887 --> 19:15.756
Somewhere along the
way, we just kind of...

19:15.857 --> 19:18.358
we lost each other.

19:18.460 --> 19:20.127
Like ships in the night.

19:20.228 --> 19:22.429
Exactly.

19:29.437 --> 19:31.205
Kids.

19:31.306 --> 19:33.540
All hell's
breaking loose over here.

19:33.641 --> 19:35.509
911 calls from the school, a kidnapping.

19:35.610 --> 19:38.011
I've got everybody on the
lookout for Albert Toland,

19:38.112 --> 19:40.447
but, look, I know we're not working
together anymore, Cat,

19:40.548 --> 19:42.516
but a little bit of a heads-up
would've been nice.

19:42.617 --> 19:44.017
Tess, I'm sorry.

19:44.118 --> 19:46.019
Honestly, we had no idea it
was gonna turn into this.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.788
It was supposed to be a simple meet.

19:47.889 --> 19:49.690
It's never simple when
it comes to you and Vincent.

19:49.791 --> 19:51.124
Hey, at least you called when you did.

19:51.226 --> 19:53.327
Let me guess, beast bounties?

19:53.428 --> 19:55.696
Hill got attacked in his home yesterday

19:55.797 --> 19:57.498
with his wife and daughter there.

19:57.599 --> 19:58.899
Are they all right?

19:59.000 --> 20:00.801
Yeah, but he's determined to figure out

20:00.902 --> 20:02.970
who's behind the bounty so
it doesn't happen again.

20:03.071 --> 20:04.805
Well, I don't blame him,
but, look, there's something funky

20:04.906 --> 20:06.573
about that accountant you
asked me to check out.

20:06.674 --> 20:08.509
According to the Office of Professions,

20:08.610 --> 20:10.310
he got his CPA license eight years ago,

20:10.411 --> 20:11.971
but he's only been making income from it

20:11.980 --> 20:13.647
up to four years ago, after that, nada.

20:13.748 --> 20:14.848
What do you mean?

20:14.949 --> 20:16.389
His wife says he works all the time.

20:16.417 --> 20:17.851
That's how he pays for
their private school.

20:17.952 --> 20:19.686
Not by accounting, not
according to this.

20:19.787 --> 20:21.054
That doesn't make sense.

20:21.155 --> 20:22.422
You know what else doesn't make sense?

20:22.524 --> 20:24.157
If Albert was going to flip on Voynov,

20:24.259 --> 20:25.592
and Voynov found out about it,

20:25.693 --> 20:27.427
why would Voynov have him kidnapped?

20:27.529 --> 20:29.096
Why wouldn't he just have
him killed right then and there?

20:29.197 --> 20:31.431
You're right. That doesn't make sense.

20:31.533 --> 20:33.671
- Have you talked to his wife?
- Yeah.

20:33.672 --> 20:34.722
She doesn't know anything.

20:34.723 --> 20:35.919
Her and her husband grew distant

20:35.920 --> 20:37.671
years ago after they had kids.

20:37.672 --> 20:38.939
Happens all the time.

20:39.040 --> 20:40.107
You don't know that.

20:40.208 --> 20:41.074
Excuse me?

20:41.175 --> 20:42.876
Sorry, never mind.

20:42.977 --> 20:44.912
All right, what's up with you?

20:45.013 --> 20:46.965
You come in here all
mopey and defensive.

20:47.095 --> 20:49.116
I-I get that we're not partners anymore,

20:49.217 --> 20:50.350
but we're still friends, right?

20:52.353 --> 20:54.121
- I'm late.
- All right, fine.

20:54.222 --> 20:56.390
- Just go, then, damn.
- No, Tess,

20:56.491 --> 20:57.758
I'm late.

20:57.859 --> 20:59.726
Oh...

20:59.827 --> 21:00.727
Oh.

21:00.828 --> 21:02.696
Yeah. Exactly.

21:02.797 --> 21:04.397
And, no, I haven't
peed on the stick yet,

21:04.465 --> 21:06.099
but it is probably just stress.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.635
Then why don't you
just pee on the stick?

21:10.171 --> 21:12.039
Because I don't want to deal with it.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.251
And I know that Vincent doesn't, either.

21:14.276 --> 21:15.099
Okay, so, what?

21:15.176 --> 21:16.877
You're just gonna wait
till you have a baby bump and...

21:16.978 --> 21:18.278
I mean, come on, you're
being ridiculous.

21:18.379 --> 21:19.546
You got to find out
one way or the other.

21:19.647 --> 21:21.048
Yes...

21:21.149 --> 21:22.716
but I would prefer to be in denial

21:22.817 --> 21:24.284
for as long as humanly possible.

21:24.385 --> 21:25.625
We've been down this road before

21:25.653 --> 21:26.853
and it is way too complicated.

21:26.888 --> 21:28.422
Okay.

21:28.523 --> 21:29.923
Oh, can you check with JT to see

21:30.024 --> 21:32.225
if he's found out anything about Voynov

21:32.327 --> 21:34.061
or-or Albert on the DHS database?

21:34.162 --> 21:35.295
No, excuse me.

21:35.396 --> 21:36.830
I don't know if you realize,

21:36.931 --> 21:38.632
but JT and I broke up, remember?

21:38.733 --> 21:40.601
I'm not asking you to sleep with him,

21:40.702 --> 21:42.402
I'm just asking you to work with him,

21:42.503 --> 21:44.605
figure out what the hell
is going on here.

21:47.775 --> 21:49.042
Great.

21:57.018 --> 21:58.418
What the hell are you doing?!

21:58.519 --> 21:59.679
Don't worry, Sammy, I got it.

21:59.754 --> 22:00.854
Well, except we don't know

22:00.955 --> 22:03.256
what he can do, remember?

22:03.358 --> 22:05.659
Still, I knocked him
down before, didn't I?

22:05.760 --> 22:07.995
What's going on? What...

22:08.096 --> 22:10.797
Where am I? What are you doing to me?

22:10.898 --> 22:12.265
We're waiting for you to do your thing.

22:12.367 --> 22:13.407
What thing? I-I don't know

22:13.468 --> 22:14.635
what you're talking about.

22:14.736 --> 22:16.096
Methinks he doth protest too much.

22:18.539 --> 22:19.539
- Stop that!
- Come on!

22:19.641 --> 22:21.775
Show us what you got...

22:21.876 --> 22:23.577
beast.

22:24.445 --> 22:26.442
Wait, what?

22:26.570 --> 22:29.408
Hold on, you think I'm...?

22:31.953 --> 22:35.489
Are you out of your mind?

22:35.590 --> 22:37.124
I'm not a beast.

22:37.225 --> 22:38.892
I mean, or whatever you call it.

22:38.993 --> 22:40.794
- You're crazy!
- Yeah?

22:40.895 --> 22:42.696
Then how come you've been
trying so hard to disprove it, huh?

22:42.797 --> 22:44.564
Every post we make,

22:44.666 --> 22:45.785
you try to undermine us.

22:45.786 --> 22:46.607
Then you pretended to be

22:46.608 --> 22:48.802
a Homeland Security
agent to scare us off.

22:48.903 --> 22:51.304
What, you didn't
think we'd check you out?

22:51.406 --> 22:52.739
You're no agent.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.174
Which can only mean

22:54.275 --> 22:56.510
- you're the beast.
- I'm not, I swear.

22:56.611 --> 22:58.571
I was only trying to save
you from getting killed!

22:59.580 --> 23:00.401
Damn it, stop it!

23:01.592 --> 23:03.861
- You got this all wrong.
- No, we don't.

23:03.979 --> 23:06.053
We've been looking for proof,
for who's been mauling people,

23:06.154 --> 23:07.320
and now we've got it.

23:07.422 --> 23:09.389
Yeah, but if I could maul you,

23:09.490 --> 23:11.130
don't you think I
would've done it by now?

23:11.159 --> 23:15.162
Do you really think these
chains could stop me?

23:15.263 --> 23:17.698
Do I look like some
kind of superhuman to you?

23:20.001 --> 23:22.436
I'm the farthest thing from it.

23:24.105 --> 23:25.539
I'm just a...

23:29.977 --> 23:31.945
I don't even know what I am anymore.

23:32.046 --> 23:34.247
I used to know, I used to be

23:34.348 --> 23:36.883
perfectly clear with
who I was, what I wanted.

23:36.984 --> 23:39.086
Then I quit my job, lost my girl.

23:39.187 --> 23:40.887
I was just...

23:40.988 --> 23:42.956
I was just trying to help,

23:43.057 --> 23:46.660
I was just trying to do the right thing.

23:52.233 --> 23:55.035
I'm nobody.

23:57.205 --> 23:59.639
He sounds more pathetic than we do.

24:05.580 --> 24:06.747
Vincent?

24:06.848 --> 24:09.108
What are you doing? Did you find Albert?

24:09.606 --> 24:13.553
No, but I found...

24:13.654 --> 24:15.222
this.

24:15.323 --> 24:17.891
Oh, my God.

24:17.992 --> 24:20.227
Bounty hunters?

24:20.328 --> 24:21.728
No.

24:21.829 --> 24:23.563
Children.

24:23.664 --> 24:24.965
How could you let this happen?

24:25.066 --> 24:26.266
I didn't have anything to do with this!

24:26.367 --> 24:27.768
See?

24:27.869 --> 24:29.770
You were supposed to
keep an eye on them.

24:29.871 --> 24:31.571
I am a cop, Vincent, I am not a nanny.

24:31.672 --> 24:34.107
Besides... wait, where are they?

24:34.208 --> 24:37.310
I'm so sorry about all of
this. I was just on the phone,

24:37.411 --> 24:39.289
trying to see if
anybody's heard from Albert.

24:39.314 --> 24:40.171
Where are the boys?

24:40.248 --> 24:42.015
Oh, they're in your bedroom,
sleeping. I hope that's okay.

24:42.116 --> 24:43.483
No, it's not.

24:43.584 --> 24:44.785
Vincent...

24:46.053 --> 24:48.989
Here, I just got this.

24:49.090 --> 24:51.825
- A ransom demand for $2 million?
- What are we going to do?

24:51.926 --> 24:53.527
- We don't have that kind of money.
- Unfortunately,

24:53.628 --> 24:55.662
the kidnappers think you
do, but the good news is,

24:55.763 --> 24:57.297
- it means he is still okay.
- Wait, but why?

24:57.398 --> 24:58.532
I mean, if they're working for Voynov,

24:58.633 --> 24:59.533
wouldn't they want to kill him?

24:59.634 --> 25:00.967
- What?
- Really?

25:01.068 --> 25:03.303
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, but she doesn't.

25:03.404 --> 25:05.214
Okay, what's going on? What
aren't you telling me?

25:05.237 --> 25:07.117
We don't know, Judy,
that's-that's the problem.

25:07.208 --> 25:09.376
Something isn't right. Vincent.

25:09.477 --> 25:10.844
Why couldn't you track him?

25:10.945 --> 25:12.279
Really?

25:12.380 --> 25:14.514
Okay. Firstly, kids were screaming,

25:14.615 --> 25:17.617
secondly, the
kidnappers kept swapping cars,

25:17.718 --> 25:18.819
and thirdly,

25:18.920 --> 25:20.080
the hospital kept calling me.

25:20.087 --> 25:21.988
So, did you find anything?

25:22.089 --> 25:23.890
I tried, but Judy doesn't know anything.

25:23.991 --> 25:25.559
What about Tess? I mean, did you think

25:25.660 --> 25:27.020
- about asking Tess to help?
- Yes.

25:27.061 --> 25:28.829
I thought about asking Tess for help,

25:28.930 --> 25:30.964
and JT, but I can't find him anywhere.

25:31.065 --> 25:33.066
- Oh, so that's it? There's nothing?
- This is not my fault.

25:33.167 --> 25:34.604
- You think it's my fault?
- Well, if you

25:34.629 --> 25:35.952
had found whatever his face is...

25:36.003 --> 25:38.238
I am, like, totally swamped right now.

25:38.339 --> 25:40.674
- It's not any easier for me!
- I'm worried about losing my job!

25:40.775 --> 25:43.443
Well, at least you aren't worried
about being pregnant!

25:56.875 --> 25:59.010
I'm-I'm-I'm so sorry.

25:59.111 --> 26:00.978
No, I'm sorry.

26:01.079 --> 26:02.980
I didn't want to blurt it out like that.

26:03.081 --> 26:04.482
No, it's fine.

26:04.583 --> 26:05.950
I just, I didn't know how to tell you.

26:06.051 --> 26:07.852
And I don't know if I am or if I'm not.

26:07.953 --> 26:09.954
Come on, don't-don't even worry about it.

26:11.323 --> 26:13.391
Come here.

26:15.082 --> 26:17.528
You know, our lives are
just so overloaded right now,

26:17.629 --> 26:19.030
we barely have time
to breathe, let alone...

26:19.131 --> 26:20.932
anything else.

26:24.069 --> 26:25.570
Really?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.905
I mean, you-you
really think you're pregnant?

26:29.141 --> 26:31.475
I don't know.

26:31.577 --> 26:33.010
I don't know, I might be.

26:33.111 --> 26:34.712
I should've taken the
test by now, but...

26:34.813 --> 26:36.047
You haven't taken the test?

26:36.148 --> 26:37.648
No.

26:37.749 --> 26:39.250
No, I was afraid.

26:39.351 --> 26:41.652
I was afraid to find out.

26:41.753 --> 26:43.054
I was afraid that it might

26:43.155 --> 26:45.356
completely overload us and we'd end up

26:45.457 --> 26:46.724
just like Judy and her husband.

26:46.825 --> 26:49.427
J-Judy and her husband?

26:49.528 --> 26:51.028
She doesn't know
anything about him anymore.

26:51.129 --> 26:52.863
They-they had kids and then

26:52.965 --> 26:55.266
they just... drifted apart.

26:55.367 --> 26:57.268
That is not gonna happen to us.

26:57.369 --> 26:58.903
No?

26:59.004 --> 27:00.538
Vincent, we've only been
married a couple of months

27:00.639 --> 27:02.073
and we are already struggling.

27:02.174 --> 27:03.341
Yeah.

27:03.442 --> 27:05.009
Two careers, beast bounties...

27:05.110 --> 27:06.710
I mean, come on, it's
a little different.

27:06.712 --> 27:08.626
- Is it?
- Yes.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.548
Couples have enough trouble

27:10.649 --> 27:12.183
trying to keep their
marriages alive every day

27:12.284 --> 27:13.764
without having to deal with the stuff

27:13.785 --> 27:15.105
that you and I have to deal with.

27:15.120 --> 27:16.120
What's gonna happen

27:16.221 --> 27:17.955
if we throw a baby into that?

27:18.056 --> 27:20.024
We'll make it work.

27:20.125 --> 27:22.727
Come on, our lives have been

27:22.828 --> 27:24.895
so overloaded before, right?

27:24.997 --> 27:26.864
But if there's
anything that we've learned,

27:26.965 --> 27:29.100
it's that we can do pretty much anything

27:29.201 --> 27:31.869
as long as we do it together.

27:31.970 --> 27:35.573
Which means we can't put
our relationship on hold,

27:35.674 --> 27:37.108
no matter what.

27:37.209 --> 27:38.476
Something's gotta give.

27:38.577 --> 27:40.077
Mm-hmm. But not us.

27:40.178 --> 27:42.944
That's all that matters.

27:52.357 --> 27:54.125
Do you feel like you need to pee yet?

27:56.995 --> 27:58.296
Yeah,

27:58.397 --> 27:59.997
but I feel like finding Albert more.

28:00.098 --> 28:02.166
Whoever he is, he needs saving.

28:02.267 --> 28:04.735
I'm gonna check with Tess and JT,

28:04.836 --> 28:06.103
see if they found anything.

28:06.204 --> 28:08.105
Okay, I'll see if I can track him.

28:08.206 --> 28:10.608
Maybe now I can be a
little more focused,

28:10.709 --> 28:13.844
that we've had our mini-meltdown.

28:13.945 --> 28:15.346
Boys, seriously!

28:15.447 --> 28:16.847
Sorry...

28:16.948 --> 28:18.249
- I don't even want to know.
- Neither do I.

28:20.252 --> 28:21.619
What do you
mean, you can't find him?

28:21.720 --> 28:23.120
How long has JT been gone?

28:23.221 --> 28:24.789
I don't know, since yesterday, I guess.

28:24.890 --> 28:26.424
He said he was going to
go deal with the bloggers,

28:26.525 --> 28:27.958
but I haven't seen him since.

28:28.060 --> 28:30.294
Oh, damn it, JT, what'd
you get yourself into now?

28:30.395 --> 28:31.529
Help...

28:33.098 --> 28:35.099
Oh, my God, are you all right?

28:35.200 --> 28:36.334
What happened?

28:36.435 --> 28:39.026
I was kidnapped.

28:39.151 --> 28:40.153
- What?
- What?

28:40.154 --> 28:41.631
I thought you were
trying to get the bloggers

28:41.632 --> 28:42.540
off of their beast obsession.

28:42.641 --> 28:44.375
I was, they didn't buy it.

28:44.476 --> 28:46.043
Obviously.

28:46.144 --> 28:47.445
Bloggers kidnapped you?

28:47.546 --> 28:49.613
With a stun gun, thank you.

28:51.650 --> 28:53.451
Do you need to go to the hospital?

28:53.552 --> 28:55.619
No, just a shrink.

28:55.721 --> 28:57.201
I don't really want to talk about it.

28:58.490 --> 29:00.958
- Were you worried?
- Yes.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.361
Because Cat needs our help

29:03.462 --> 29:05.062
to find somebody else who was kidnapped.

29:05.063 --> 29:06.130
Oh.

29:06.231 --> 29:07.465
Let's go.

29:42.601 --> 29:43.701
Any luck?

29:43.802 --> 29:45.042
On Voynov, yeah, as advertised,

29:45.137 --> 29:46.270
but nothing we didn't already know.

29:46.371 --> 29:47.571
What about Albert?

29:47.672 --> 29:49.273
That's the real question.

29:49.374 --> 29:51.409
I've searched DOJ, FBI, SEC...

29:51.510 --> 29:53.744
there's absolutely nothing on him.

29:53.845 --> 29:55.446
He hasn't even paid taxes in four years.

29:55.547 --> 29:56.847
Which is around the same time

29:56.948 --> 29:58.048
he stopped making
money as an accountant.

29:58.150 --> 29:59.083
Who is this guy?

29:59.184 --> 30:01.185
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

30:01.286 --> 30:03.220
- Wait, what happened?
- Don't ask.

30:03.321 --> 30:05.623
He doesn't want to talk about it.

30:05.724 --> 30:07.525
You sure Secretary Hill said
that Albert worked for Voynov?

30:07.626 --> 30:09.727
- Yeah. Doesn't he?
- We can't find any connection.

30:09.828 --> 30:11.362
And it's looking more and more like

30:11.463 --> 30:13.197
he was kidnapped by a
different person for another reason.

30:13.298 --> 30:15.299
What are we missing?

30:15.400 --> 30:17.268
Why don't you try searching Interpol?

30:17.369 --> 30:19.103
His wife said he travels abroad a lot,

30:19.204 --> 30:20.471
maybe there's something there.

30:20.572 --> 30:21.839
Okay.

30:23.341 --> 30:25.376
Hey. Did you pee?

30:25.477 --> 30:27.411
No.

30:27.512 --> 30:29.046
She'll get to it when she gets to it.

30:29.147 --> 30:30.047
Wait, you know, too?

30:30.148 --> 30:31.315
Know what?

30:31.416 --> 30:32.683
Nothing.

30:34.352 --> 30:36.420
Sorry.

31:26.438 --> 31:27.938
Where did he go?

31:28.039 --> 31:29.306
Behind you.

31:45.957 --> 31:47.691
It's okay. It's okay, you're safe.

31:47.792 --> 31:49.733
Come on.

31:52.464 --> 31:53.664
Who are those guys, huh?

31:53.765 --> 31:56.166
Why did they kidnap you?

31:56.268 --> 31:57.401
I don't know.

31:57.502 --> 31:58.969
I-I just assumed Voynov was...

31:59.070 --> 32:01.505
- No, Voynov had nothing to do with it.
- What?

32:03.675 --> 32:05.009
You took them all out?

32:05.110 --> 32:07.478
- By yourself?
- Come on.

32:07.579 --> 32:08.812
He's not an accountant.

32:08.914 --> 32:10.748
And his name's not Albert Toland,

32:10.849 --> 32:12.249
at least not his only name.

32:12.350 --> 32:13.684
I ran his photo through Interpol,

32:13.785 --> 32:16.053
cross-referenced with FSB, Mossad.

32:16.154 --> 32:16.987
He's an assassin.

32:17.088 --> 32:18.722
A professional hit man.

32:18.823 --> 32:21.370
Being an accountant, apparently,
is just a cover.

32:21.486 --> 32:23.581
But wait, I don't
get it. What was he doing

32:23.582 --> 32:24.915
at that private school? I thought he was

32:24.916 --> 32:25.930
there to meet you, to flip on Voynov.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.398
That's what he wanted us to think,

32:27.499 --> 32:29.066
that he was an
innocent, to get to Vincent.

32:29.167 --> 32:31.502
Which means Vincent's in trouble.

32:33.004 --> 32:34.471
Come on.

32:42.937 --> 32:44.257
You mind if I ask you a question?

32:44.339 --> 32:45.506
Sure.

32:45.607 --> 32:47.508
What is it you do for a living?

32:47.609 --> 32:48.395
Me?

32:48.547 --> 32:50.544
I'm an accountant.

32:52.480 --> 32:54.848
Thought so.

32:54.949 --> 32:57.951
Something tells me that's not true.

32:58.052 --> 32:59.720
No?

32:59.821 --> 33:01.054
No.

33:01.156 --> 33:02.716
Why didn't you tell your wife the truth?

33:02.724 --> 33:05.292
Is Judy okay? The boys?

33:05.393 --> 33:07.227
Yeah, they're fine.

33:07.328 --> 33:08.436
Just think she's a little confused

33:08.437 --> 33:10.631
that someone's trying to
kidnap you for $2 million

33:10.732 --> 33:12.533
that she doesn't even know you have.

33:12.634 --> 33:14.902
That's understandable.

33:15.003 --> 33:16.804
We don't talk much these days.

33:16.905 --> 33:18.071
Marriage.

33:18.173 --> 33:19.406
And I certainly

33:19.507 --> 33:21.275
did not expect to get kidnapped.

33:21.376 --> 33:23.610
I must have pissed somebody off.

33:23.711 --> 33:24.812
But not Voynov.

33:24.913 --> 33:26.747
I don't even know who he is.

33:26.848 --> 33:29.750
Except that he's on some DHS watch list,

33:29.851 --> 33:32.119
which is why I wanted you
to think I worked for him.

33:32.220 --> 33:33.754
Why?

33:33.855 --> 33:35.422
So you'd be willing to meet me,

33:35.523 --> 33:36.657
preferably unguarded,

33:36.758 --> 33:39.560
for obvious reasons.

33:39.661 --> 33:42.629
Your reputation precedes you, Vincent.

33:42.730 --> 33:44.832
So, what? You're just
another bounty hunter?

33:44.933 --> 33:46.767
A bounty hunter?

33:46.868 --> 33:48.435
No.

33:48.536 --> 33:50.737
I am much more than that.

33:56.678 --> 33:58.846
Whoa! What was that?

34:22.203 --> 34:23.570
Ah...

34:41.121 --> 34:42.989
Ah!

34:51.099 --> 34:52.299
I'm off the
bridge, headed south on Hicks.

34:52.400 --> 34:53.667
Where to next?

34:53.768 --> 34:54.635
I've got Vincent

34:54.735 --> 34:55.902
on a Port Authority

34:56.004 --> 34:56.840
surveillance camera

34:56.841 --> 34:59.506
- walking east on DeGraw.
- Okay, then where to?

34:59.607 --> 35:01.447
I don't know, that's
the last I see of him.

35:01.476 --> 35:03.343
There's a junkyard ahead
on Wharf. Maybe try there.

35:03.444 --> 35:05.846
Try? Vincent might not
have time for me to try.

35:05.947 --> 35:07.347
It has to be right. Keep looking!

35:12.320 --> 35:14.655
At least now I know why

35:14.756 --> 35:17.157
I was told to be careful with you.

35:23.197 --> 35:24.698
So what are you?

35:24.799 --> 35:27.367
Some kind of experiment
gone wrong or something?

35:27.468 --> 35:30.103
Or something.

35:30.204 --> 35:33.106
I thought you were
supposed to capture me, not kill me.

35:33.207 --> 35:34.675
Not what I was told.

35:34.776 --> 35:36.176
Come on, who sent you?

35:36.277 --> 35:38.078
I can't tell you that, now, can I?

35:38.179 --> 35:39.913
Come on, what difference does it make?

35:40.014 --> 35:42.516
You're gonna kill me anyway, right?

35:45.954 --> 35:47.688
Ah!

35:56.164 --> 35:58.198
I really wish I knew how you do that.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.902
Thanks for saving me, by the way.

36:17.352 --> 36:18.719
You're right.

36:18.820 --> 36:20.153
Something's gotta give, huh?

36:28.993 --> 36:31.498
You're just lucky the
bullet missed your kidney.

36:31.599 --> 36:32.766
Otherwise...

36:32.867 --> 36:34.167
Yeah, I know the otherwise.

36:34.268 --> 36:35.635
Doctors make the worst patients.

36:35.737 --> 36:36.903
- How is he?
- The good news?

36:37.004 --> 36:38.505
If he lays low for a while

36:38.606 --> 36:40.741
and makes a passing
attempt at being a good patient,

36:40.842 --> 36:42.109
he'll recover fully.

36:42.210 --> 36:43.410
And the bad news?

36:43.511 --> 36:45.579
He owes me another shift.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.247
That's three, by the
way, but who's counting?

36:47.348 --> 36:48.915
Okay. I will make it up to you.

36:49.016 --> 36:49.883
Damn right.

36:52.286 --> 36:54.955
- He's all yours.
- Thank you.

37:00.294 --> 37:01.862
Are you sure you're okay to go home?

37:01.963 --> 37:04.131
I hate hospitals. Food sucks.

37:05.633 --> 37:07.267
What did Hill say?

37:07.368 --> 37:09.269
Mostly, he was apologizing
for letting Albert trick him

37:09.370 --> 37:11.037
into luring you out in the open.

37:11.139 --> 37:13.440
You know, he probably
wasn't thinking straight,

37:13.541 --> 37:15.041
considering he was almost killed.

37:15.143 --> 37:17.377
Still,

37:17.478 --> 37:19.146
it may not be Voynov,

37:19.247 --> 37:20.487
but whoever's behind the bounty

37:20.548 --> 37:22.349
knows that you are the
beast now, Vincent.

37:22.450 --> 37:24.885
And now that they know who I really am,

37:24.986 --> 37:27.120
they don't want to capture me.

37:27.221 --> 37:28.955
Unfortunately, they want to kill me.

37:29.056 --> 37:32.459
May not be much time to lay low, huh?

37:32.560 --> 37:34.661
Ooh...

37:34.762 --> 37:35.996
Okay.

37:50.812 --> 37:52.379
Damn it.

37:52.480 --> 37:54.514
You always hold the cue stick wrong.

37:54.615 --> 37:55.682
What?

37:55.783 --> 37:58.218
Give me that.

37:58.319 --> 38:00.854
Let me show you how it's done.

38:00.955 --> 38:02.222
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

38:02.323 --> 38:03.490
All right.

38:03.591 --> 38:05.559
Keep it at hip level,

38:05.660 --> 38:06.993
hold the butt,

38:07.094 --> 38:08.795
and stroke it.

38:10.031 --> 38:11.698
Just like that.

38:11.799 --> 38:13.333
Show-off.

38:14.702 --> 38:16.336
What are you doing here?

38:16.437 --> 38:18.438
What, you got the bar in the breakup?

38:18.539 --> 38:20.340
Funny.

38:20.441 --> 38:22.742
You certainly seem to
be handling it pretty well.

38:22.844 --> 38:24.110
Yeah?

38:25.179 --> 38:26.213
Well, I'm not.

38:26.314 --> 38:27.581
I'm not.

38:27.682 --> 38:28.915
It sucks, I miss you.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.283
But it is what it is.

38:30.384 --> 38:32.419
No, I don't like it,

38:32.520 --> 38:34.187
but you made a decision,

38:34.288 --> 38:36.223
so you got to figure out who
you are and what you want.

38:36.324 --> 38:38.225
Why do you care?

38:38.326 --> 38:39.926
Just because we're not
together doesn't mean

38:40.027 --> 38:41.561
I don't care
anymore. That doesn't change.

38:41.662 --> 38:43.029
I just need you to be smart

38:43.130 --> 38:44.464
about how you go about finding

38:44.565 --> 38:46.566
whatever the hell it
is you're searching for.

38:46.667 --> 38:48.301
You mean like, don't get kidnapped?

38:48.402 --> 38:49.703
Yeah, don't get kidnapped.

38:49.804 --> 38:52.205
And don't try to be a hero, okay?

38:52.306 --> 38:53.802
- Just be you.
- I don't even

38:53.827 --> 38:55.432
know what that is anymore.

38:55.509 --> 38:56.977
Look, you know you want to
make a difference, right?

38:57.078 --> 38:58.718
By doing more than
just being a professor?

38:58.813 --> 39:00.380
So follow that.

39:00.481 --> 39:02.649
I tried. I got kidnapped.

39:02.750 --> 39:04.818
But it wasn't a total failure.

39:04.919 --> 39:06.987
You got the bloggers to
take down their Web site, right?

39:07.088 --> 39:09.155
That means they believed you.

39:09.257 --> 39:11.892
That's a good thing.

39:11.993 --> 39:13.326
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:13.427 --> 39:14.828
It is, isn't it?

39:14.929 --> 39:16.263
Mm-hmm.

39:16.364 --> 39:18.031
Thank you.

39:20.034 --> 39:21.501
You're paying.

39:24.538 --> 39:26.740
You really come all the way down here

39:26.841 --> 39:29.142
just to give me a pep talk?

39:29.243 --> 39:30.410
Yeah.

39:30.511 --> 39:32.178
And for free beer.

39:32.280 --> 39:34.915
Cheers.

39:35.016 --> 39:36.283
Wiseass.

39:36.384 --> 39:38.251
- Mm-hmm.
- Such a wiseass.

39:52.533 --> 39:54.467
Well?

39:54.568 --> 39:56.536
Negative.

39:58.639 --> 40:00.373
Are you disappointed?

40:00.474 --> 40:02.309
No.

40:02.410 --> 40:03.543
Yes.

40:03.644 --> 40:05.712
A little? I don't know.

40:05.813 --> 40:07.614
I never really was one of those girls

40:07.715 --> 40:09.816
who always dreamed about being a mom,

40:09.917 --> 40:12.118
but when I actually thought

40:12.219 --> 40:14.654
I might be pregnant, I, um...

40:14.755 --> 40:16.489
I liked it.

40:16.590 --> 40:18.325
What about you?

40:18.426 --> 40:19.859
You must be relieved.

40:19.961 --> 40:21.127
No.

40:21.228 --> 40:22.329
No, not at all.

40:22.430 --> 40:23.897
Hmm... Mm-hmm.

40:23.998 --> 40:26.166
Okay, maybe just a little bit.

40:26.267 --> 40:27.634
It's not that I don't want to have kids,

40:27.735 --> 40:28.868
I mean, I do, but...

40:28.970 --> 40:30.870
What?

40:30.972 --> 40:32.372
I just, I don't know,

40:32.473 --> 40:33.907
I would hate for
them to have to go through

40:34.008 --> 40:35.608
any of the stuff that I've been through.

40:39.613 --> 40:40.747
Vincent...

40:40.848 --> 40:42.415
we don't even know if it can

40:42.516 --> 40:43.850
- be passed down or not.
- Yeah?

40:43.951 --> 40:45.518
Look at Tori.

40:45.619 --> 40:47.587
Things didn't turn out so
well for her, did they?

40:52.593 --> 40:55.261
Hopefully, he would've
turned out like your side anyway.

40:55.363 --> 40:57.464
Or she would have.

40:58.966 --> 41:00.734
It's probably for the best, though.

41:00.835 --> 41:02.002
Yeah.

41:02.103 --> 41:03.236
Somebody's got a target

41:03.337 --> 41:04.571
on your back again, Vincent.

41:04.672 --> 41:06.239
They know who you are now.

41:06.340 --> 41:07.507
We're running out of time.

41:07.608 --> 41:09.676
What do we do?

41:09.777 --> 41:13.513
Not put our relationship on hold.

41:15.383 --> 41:17.217
Come here.
