00:06.879 --> 00:08.848
Thank you. Enjoy your Anne Murray.

00:08.885 --> 00:11.409
Though, I don't see how that's possible.

00:14.161 --> 00:16.181
- Hello Steven.
- He, hi, man !

00:17.191 --> 00:19.844
Leo, this is my dad, WB.

00:20.490 --> 00:23.705
Ohh ! Now I've seen everything.

00:25.079 --> 00:26.863
You're surprised he's black, huh ?

00:26.887 --> 00:29.270
No, his fly's open.

00:31.920 --> 00:36.535
Wow, look at all these kids.
Pretty busy for a Tuesday morning.

00:36.582 --> 00:38.202
Yeah it's kind of a fire sale.

00:38.235 --> 00:42.040
We put stuff on sale, then I go down to the high school
and pull the fire alarm.

00:43.113 --> 00:46.427
If the store's keeps doing OK,
there might be a nice bonus in your future.

00:46.446 --> 00:49.055
Or how I like to call it, a retroactive child support.

00:49.984 --> 00:51.426
Hey who's pretty boy ?

00:51.809 --> 00:55.080
Oh hey, I'm Randy, but I really wouldn't call me pretty.

00:55.126 --> 00:58.752
I'm more like solitary, angular yet soft.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.532
Really anything that would describe Faye Dunaway.

01:03.278 --> 01:06.433
So Steven, what are you and Faye
Dunaway doing this weekend ?

01:07.186 --> 01:10.591
Oh, well, the Point Place youth club
is doing a big thrash clean up,

01:10.638 --> 01:13.491
so we were going down there and throw cans at them.

01:15.096 --> 01:16.640
Check these out.

01:17.726 --> 01:20.890
Front-row tickets to Eric Clapton in Chicago ?

01:22.205 --> 01:24.643
That's the coolest thing anyone has ever done for me.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.861
What show you a couple of concert tickets ?

01:27.206 --> 01:28.590
You're not going !

01:30.355 --> 01:33.810
So listen, I stopped by to see if you
wanted to house-sit for me.

01:33.848 --> 01:36.642
You know, bringing the mail, water the plants,

01:36.688 --> 01:38.230
feed my dog Whity.

01:41.107 --> 01:42.713
Your dog's name is Whity ?

01:43.037 --> 01:44.592
Nooo, I was talking to you.

01:46.998 --> 01:49.193
Yes, guess I can do that.

01:49.615 --> 01:53.631
Wow man, I'm staying at my Dad's house,
it's like the childhood I never had.

01:54.307 --> 01:55.813
And I won't be there.

01:56.776 --> 01:58.781
Just like the childhood you did have.

02:00.000 --> 02:06.074

02:07.777 --> 02:08.961
Mrs Forman ?

02:11.737 --> 02:13.302
I need to talk to you.

02:14.088 --> 02:17.160
I'm really sorry that Randy and I
were kissing in Eric's room.

02:17.188 --> 02:18.701
It was inappropriate.

02:18.907 --> 02:23.070
Oh actually honey I'm surprised
you even had time to apologize.

02:23.958 --> 02:27.302
I thought you would be up there making out
with the rest of Wisconsin.

02:28.867 --> 02:32.713
What the hell are you doing showing affection
outside of your own home anyway ?

02:33.568 --> 02:36.331
Kitty and I, we never kiss or hug in public.

02:37.115 --> 02:40.981
As far as the rest of the world is concerned,
we're complete strangers.

02:43.175 --> 02:47.213
I didn't mean to offend you.
You've always been like a mother to me.

02:47.278 --> 02:52.142
Like remember when you made me hot coco when
my parents got snowed in that swinger's club ?

02:53.107 --> 02:58.181
Oh Donna I'm not going to let one little
incident ruin a lifelong friendship.

02:58.968 --> 03:01.602
Oh hey, look Red,

03:01.657 --> 03:04.401
this egg is kinda shaped like Randy's head.

03:08.795 --> 03:11.242
And now it's thrash just like Donna.

03:15.235 --> 03:18.753

Oh,

03:54.216 --> 03:56.751
this pineapple reminds me of Donna,

03:58.415 --> 04:00.270
it's a little tart.

04:01.836 --> 04:05.720
hey don't call my daughter names,
you can call me names

04:05.886 --> 04:07.451
but I really wish you wouldn't.

04:08.608 --> 04:11.351
Why, I just don't know what she sees in Randy.

04:11.397 --> 04:14.941
He's so charming and friendly and

04:15.248 --> 04:17.992
always willing to lend a helping hand.

04:19.476 --> 04:21.350
What a jackass !

04:26.356 --> 04:27.622
Well I like him.

04:28.635 --> 04:30.300
He calls me Mr. P.

04:31.076 --> 04:32.813
Where did he come up with that one ?

04:34.058 --> 04:37.193
Kitty, if Donna's going to date anyone, why not him ?

04:37.227 --> 04:40.193
I mean his bright, he's good with tools
and most important,

04:40.238 --> 04:44.272
he has never once tried to teach me
the ways of the Jedi.

04:48.555 --> 04:51.390
Wait a minute, you like Randy too ?

04:52.517 --> 04:56.670
Well I'm just saying, I don't hate him
as mush as I hate most people.

04:58.257 --> 05:03.323
Well you have said a lot of hurtful things
but this is the worse.

05:04.937 --> 05:05.922
Kitty.

05:07.045 --> 05:08.302
She's crazy.

05:10.175 --> 05:11.921
This  pineapple's delicious.

05:16.697 --> 05:19.651
See now this is the kind of house I want.

05:19.695 --> 05:24.082
And I know that if I work hard enough,
I can find someone would buy one for me.

05:25.627 --> 05:27.801
Men, this place is clean.

05:28.046 --> 05:29.613
You're sure no women leaves here, man ?

05:30.356 --> 05:34.362
Steven, please, I don't need a woman
living here to keep a clean house.

05:34.408 --> 05:35.811
I have a maid

05:36.968 --> 05:38.833
and she's a white girl.

05:39.896 --> 05:42.293
And then Mrs Forman said you looked like an egg

05:42.356 --> 05:44.910
and then threw your broken head into the thrash.

05:45.327 --> 05:49.083
Well I don't take it too personally because I've noticed something about Mrs Forman,

05:49.118 --> 05:50.503
she's a wackedoo.

05:51.318 --> 05:55.182
Oh, cool ! Peter Frampton gave you a signed guitar.

05:55.228 --> 06:00.020
He you know what, I have a handful of his hair and one
of them has a little piece of skin at the end of it.

06:02.526 --> 06:06.153
Yeah, she keeps it next to Leith Gareth's used q-tip.

06:06.467 --> 06:09.922
Hey, I had to kiss a roodie named Larry for that one.

06:13.458 --> 06:17.583
Well, there's the kitchen, there's the living-room
and there's the bar.

06:17.628 --> 06:19.623
Don't touch anything !

06:20.977 --> 06:24.201
Don't worry man. I'll treat this place
like a broken tool of myself.

06:25.195 --> 06:26.301
Hey guys,

06:26.907 --> 06:29.601
the toilet seat there is heated.

06:33.785 --> 06:35.743
It felt so good on my face.

06:39.595 --> 06:42.803
Man, watching your Dad's place is a big responsibility

06:42.837 --> 06:47.773
and I just know that the 500 strangers we invited to the party are going to give the respect it deserves.

06:48.988 --> 06:52.732
No way, man. WB is trusting me and
I'm not thrashing his house.

06:52.776 --> 06:56.523
Well, that's the beauty of our plan,
we will thrash it for you.

06:56.927 --> 07:00.152
Oh ! Hyde doesn't want to disappoint his Daddy.

07:01.157 --> 07:04.603
I'm Hyde and I love my Dad and he loves me

07:04.657 --> 07:07.232
and we're making up for lost time and...

07:07.275 --> 07:09.231
Actually that's kind of touching.

07:11.668 --> 07:12.952
Come on Hyde !

07:12.997 --> 07:16.311
Don't you want to find out if 500
people can fit in that pool ?

07:16.386 --> 07:19.610
No, alright ? I'm not letting you guys
taught me into having a party.

07:19.657 --> 07:21.421
I'm not doing something that stupid.

07:22.575 --> 07:25.590
Look everybody, I'm dancing like a chicken.

07:36.335 --> 07:38.080
Ever since I said I like Randy,

07:38.125 --> 07:42.031
Kitty has been stumping around,
making life miserable for me.

07:42.715 --> 07:46.001
I can't describe how bad it is over there.

07:46.375 --> 07:49.292
Well it made you wanna come
over and hang out with me.

07:50.477 --> 07:53.230
That's the perfect way to describe it.

07:55.257 --> 07:56.672
I'm glad you came.

07:57.067 --> 07:58.410
Taste this.

08:01.975 --> 08:02.802
Hum.

08:03.407 --> 08:04.762
That taste's pretty good.

08:05.445 --> 08:07.872
It's cause it's made with 5 different cheeses !

08:09.235 --> 08:10.380
What's it called ?

08:10.627 --> 08:12.173
5 different cheeses.

08:14.867 --> 08:17.233
Oh, save room for cheese cake.

08:26.337 --> 08:28.272
God this place looks great.

08:28.317 --> 08:30.602
WB will never know we had a party.

08:31.076 --> 08:33.082
You missed something behind the couch.

08:36.926 --> 08:38.461
Drive safe.

08:39.217 --> 08:42.232
You know, all this cleaning is actually kind of satisfying.

08:42.397 --> 08:46.630
I bet my maid is thrilled she's not a
doctor in her country anymore.

08:48.105 --> 08:52.153
Well, I cleaned up that dirty limbrick of the wall. 

08:52.476 --> 08:55.131
I don't know where this Notucket place is

08:55.436 --> 08:57.082
but the men there are disgusting.

08:59.298 --> 09:01.642
Man, I should not have thrown a party here.

09:01.798 --> 09:04.071
It's weird but I feel kinda guilty.

09:04.138 --> 09:06.103
I never felt guilty before in my life.

09:06.147 --> 09:08.210
Even when the judge said " you're guilty."

09:09.476 --> 09:11.050
You think that's weird ?

09:11.077 --> 09:14.120
I  took my pants off but my undies are gone.

09:15.998 --> 09:17.903
You're not gonna believe this, but

09:17.966 --> 09:19.633
I  think I'm wearing them.

09:25.938 --> 09:28.750
Hey, what the hell is the guitar doing on the floor ?

09:28.788 --> 09:32.470
Oh you took it down to whack all
the women in the bum with it.

09:32.608 --> 09:35.530
Hum hum. You called it Hyde's Spankomatic.

09:40.418 --> 09:42.043
Well, it looks alright.

09:47.858 --> 09:50.532
What are you talking about ? It's broken into pieces.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.660
Ok, so we should probably say goodnight here

09:57.703 --> 10:00.937
because if my dad saw us kissing,
he'll yell Yoo Hoo !

10:03.546 --> 10:07.295
Oh look at this, Randy and Donna kissing.

10:07.744 --> 10:08.896
Yoo Hoo !

10:10.449 --> 10:13.282
Well I think I shouldn't get too upset because

10:13.327 --> 10:19.020
after all it's none of my business what two people
do in the privacy of my own drive-way.

10:19.495 --> 10:21.360
Mrs Forman, I'm sorry you're uncomfortable

10:21.385 --> 10:23.791
but for the last time, Eric broke up with me.

10:23.828 --> 10:26.582
I don't care. You should still be waiting for him.

10:26.618 --> 10:29.040
When Red went to war, I waited for him,

10:29.065 --> 10:31.850
and I had more men coming after me than Hitler !

10:33.457 --> 10:34.413
That's different !

10:34.438 --> 10:37.663
Eric chose to go to Africa and
he chose to break up with me.

10:37.687 --> 10:40.653
Well, maybe he wouldn't have left
if you were a better girlfriend.

10:41.275 --> 10:43.670
well, maybe if you hadn't been so
smothering and controlling him,

10:43.708 --> 10:47.210
he wouldn't have gone half way across
the world just to get away from you.

10:54.406 --> 10:57.420
Eh, that egg shell does look like me !

10:59.085 --> 11:00.163
Hey handsome.

11:06.715 --> 11:08.862
Red, do one more.

11:09.216 --> 11:10.453
What am I now ?

11:12.526 --> 11:13.950
A deer.

11:14.476 --> 11:16.150
No, a rhinoceros.

11:17.895 --> 11:19.221
What I am now ?

11:19.897 --> 11:21.193
A moron.

11:22.465 --> 11:24.482
Wrong again, I'm a deer !

11:25.786 --> 11:29.551
Mr Forman, your wife just saw me
and Randy kissing in the drive-way.

11:29.577 --> 11:30.550
Yoo Hoo.

11:34.495 --> 11:37.151
Then she yelled at us, so I told
her she was a bad mother

11:37.175 --> 11:39.833
and that Eric went to Africa to get away from her.

11:39.856 --> 11:41.781
Now she's really mad at me.

11:41.847 --> 11:44.560
Well, of course, she's mad at you Donna.

11:44.617 --> 11:48.130
You can't just go around telling people the truth.

11:51.637 --> 11:54.043
Why in the hell didn't you stop them ?

11:54.067 --> 11:56.481
Because the last time I got between two women,

11:56.627 --> 11:59.360
well, that actually worked out very well.

12:01.578 --> 12:04.052
Well, thanks Donna. Now you've made it worse.

12:04.085 --> 12:06.390
I have to go and fix this now.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.553
Because if I have to stay here another day with your dad,

12:10.668 --> 12:12.490
I'm gonna end up killing myself.

12:14.226 --> 12:15.483
No offence.

12:16.518 --> 12:18.262
How was that no offence ?

12:18.998 --> 12:21.122
You should have just said offence.

12:23.836 --> 12:25.890
Fine, offence.

12:26.965 --> 12:29.941
OK, go but you're gonna miss out
on what I'm doing for dinner:

12:29.985 --> 12:31.582
5 different meats.

12:41.426 --> 12:43.281
This thing is completely destroyed.

12:43.306 --> 12:45.733
Yeah. You know what else happened at the party ?

12:45.778 --> 12:48.693
A guy grabbed my butt and his
girlfriend got very mad at them.

12:48.728 --> 12:50.381
You know, I think they broke up.

12:50.788 --> 12:52.631
I had a great time.

12:53.755 --> 12:55.730
I'm screwed, man.

12:55.765 --> 12:57.642
WB is in the music industry.

12:57.666 --> 13:00.222
They can kill anyone and make it look like an accident.

13:01.505 --> 13:04.800
They did it to Mama Kass, they did it to Hendrix,

13:04.886 --> 13:07.553
they even took out Bobby Holly, they got the big bumper.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.280
Oh Hyde, you're such a baby !

13:11.638 --> 13:16.381
Oh I'm Hyde and I just lost the
trust of the father I just met.

13:16.675 --> 13:19.192
Oh, here comes the waterfall again.

13:23.065 --> 13:27.183
Oh, I hear you and Donna had quite a fight.

13:28.406 --> 13:30.300
You wanna tell me what happened ?

13:30.746 --> 13:33.242
well, your guess is as good as mine.

13:33.535 --> 13:38.843
I saw Donna and Randy in the drive-way,
I politely said Good day

13:39.227 --> 13:42.511
and out of nowhere she just bit my head off.

13:43.037 --> 13:46.012
- Completely unprovoked ?
- Completely.

13:46.047 --> 13:48.711
- So just like all of our fights.
- Exactly.

13:51.886 --> 13:53.590
Yeah, well,

13:54.218 --> 13:55.543
look Kitty.

13:56.088 --> 13:59.092
What happened with Eric and Donna is normal.

13:59.266 --> 14:03.850
People, people move away, they move on.

14:04.138 --> 14:08.691
Just like you did when I went off to war
and you dated Roger Silver.

14:10.025 --> 14:11.742
You knew about that ?

14:12.988 --> 14:16.393
Well you guys should probably not have
gone on America's Band stage.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.300
Well my situation was different.

14:20.345 --> 14:23.690
You were overseas, I had to keep my options open.

14:23.768 --> 14:25.241
Donna is a whore.

14:32.066 --> 14:33.850
What do you think, man. Can you fix it ?

14:34.235 --> 14:37.883
I don't know, man. You kinda caught me at a bad time.

14:39.115 --> 14:41.873
Right in the middle of Hawai 5-0.

14:43.037 --> 14:45.660
Leo, there is no TV in here.

14:45.976 --> 14:48.803
That doesn't change the fact that it's on.

14:50.507 --> 14:52.970
Look, man, I actually really need your help.

14:53.565 --> 14:55.893
OK, I can fix this, man.

14:56.098 --> 14:58.420
But I just need to do one thing to prepare.

15:00.535 --> 15:02.113
OK here we go,

15:02.495 --> 15:03.372
gloves,

15:06.925 --> 15:07.820
knife,

15:10.386 --> 15:11.260
napkin.

15:16.828 --> 15:19.423
You can't fix a guitar in an empty stomach.

15:25.568 --> 15:27.253
Oh, hi Donna.

15:27.615 --> 15:32.371
I didn't recognize you without a 6 feet
stranger boy attached to your face.

15:35.826 --> 15:39.161
Mrs Forman, about what happened in the drive-way,

15:39.497 --> 15:42.751
we both said some things we probably didn't mean.

15:42.786 --> 15:43.920
I didn't.

15:46.468 --> 15:49.712
Oh I'm just saying. We both got emotional

15:49.755 --> 15:52.722
and we said some things we might want to take back.

15:52.746 --> 15:54.453
I can't think of anything.

15:55.987 --> 15:58.503
But you do admit you were on the drive-way, right ?

15:58.545 --> 16:01.792
I don't know, it looks more like a brothel to me.

16:02.135 --> 16:04.120
Mrs Forman, please.

16:05.137 --> 16:09.431
I just came over here to tell you
that the whole thing with Randy,

16:10.047 --> 16:11.993
it was all a huge mistake.

16:12.016 --> 16:15.390
Oh, Donna. I am so happy to hear you say that.

16:15.426 --> 16:16.810
So are you and I okay ?

16:16.855 --> 16:18.650
Of course we are !

16:20.066 --> 16:25.492
Ohhh. I never really saw you with Randy
anyway, he's awful handsome.

16:25.517 --> 16:26.262
Oh,

16:27.497 --> 16:31.312
no, we're still together. We just won't
kiss in front of you anymore.

16:31.407 --> 16:35.151
And for the record, I can get any guy I want.
I am damn hot.

16:35.175 --> 16:39.482
You should hear the disgusting things construction
workers say they wanna do to me.

16:40.437 --> 16:45.293
Oh come on Donna. You don't belong with Randy
anyway and just wait when Eric gets home...

16:45.335 --> 16:50.092
Mrs Forman listen to me. When Eric comes back
we are not going back together.

16:50.127 --> 16:52.220
So  you need to get over it.

16:52.246 --> 16:56.301
How am I supposed to get over Eric running off to Africa.

16:56.578 --> 16:59.113
he was supposed to stay here, marry you and... 

16:59.138 --> 17:04.631
and give me and Red 3 wonderful grandchildren
named Ronald, Rose and Kitty Junior.

17:05.457 --> 17:09.160
Only everyone would call her Kitkat
so that it doesn't get confusing.

17:10.717 --> 17:13.443
Oh my god. So you're not mad at me, you're mad at Eric.

17:13.474 --> 17:15.893
Of course I'm mad at Eric.

17:17.318 --> 17:20.252
It just wasn't supposed to turn out this way.

17:22.185 --> 17:25.070
Mrs Forman, I'll always care about Eric

17:26.055 --> 17:28.623
but, it's over.

17:29.708 --> 17:31.210
I know.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.640
S oo...

17:38.196 --> 17:39.142
Kitty Junior ?

17:42.378 --> 17:46.690
Or Kitty the second. Whichever
you prefer. It's your child.

17:50.005 --> 17:52.651
There you go, the guitar is all fixed.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.050
Leo, I could kiss you, man.

17:55.488 --> 17:58.362
Ok, but that's as far as you gonna get.

17:59.815 --> 18:03.350
Hey, where is my kiss ? I'm the one
who whipped off all the graffiti.

18:04.136 --> 18:04.850
What ?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.910
Yeah, some jerk named Peter Frampton
wrote his name on it.

18:08.375 --> 18:09.262
Fez !

18:09.808 --> 18:12.160
You moron, this is Peter Frampton's guitar.

18:12.195 --> 18:14.130
- Who ?
- Peter Frampton.

18:14.385 --> 18:18.962
The talentless idiot that a million brainless
teenage girls made a star ?!

18:19.765 --> 18:22.042
I love Peter Frampton !

18:22.265 --> 18:23.721
A million and one.

18:26.726 --> 18:29.271
Oh my god, my dad's here.
What am I going to do ?

18:29.375 --> 18:31.973
Don't worry, I'll take care of him with this !

18:32.018 --> 18:33.793
Hands down, you son of a bitch !

18:35.838 --> 18:38.492
You now what, I'll sign it myself.

18:38.636 --> 18:40.931
Peter Frampton's wrote on many things.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.613
I'll just leave the sucks part.

18:47.798 --> 18:50.900
- Hey there Steven !
- Hey man, how was Clapton ?

18:50.935 --> 18:53.182
Great. I got you a T-shirt.

18:54.065 --> 18:55.920
"I love Chicago."

18:56.536 --> 18:58.840
I didn't remember tilI got to the airport.

18:59.396 --> 19:01.043
Wow, look at this place.

19:01.066 --> 19:04.133
You know I was thinking I was gonna give you a nice
cash bonus but now I don't think I'm going to.

19:04.176 --> 19:06.643
- You're not ?
- No, check this out !

19:09.706 --> 19:12.203
Eric Clapton signed this guitar.

19:12.636 --> 19:14.920
- Oh my God, I love Clapton.
- Me too !

19:14.958 --> 19:16.990
That's why I'm giving you the Peter Frampton.

19:19.196 --> 19:20.970
Actually, you know,

19:21.508 --> 19:25.050
the store is going great, you took
care of the house so... here.

19:26.825 --> 19:28.602
You're giving me the Clapton guitar ?

19:28.648 --> 19:29.961
Yeah, you deserve it.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.590
Ohhh, yeah.

19:36.017 --> 19:38.230
WB I got something bad to tell you.

19:39.177 --> 19:41.740
Well, actually it's kind of funny too.

19:44.467 --> 19:45.772
No it's mostly bad.

19:48.005 --> 19:50.212
You know, I'd say 50-50 funny bad.

19:52.837 --> 19:57.401
I threw the most freaking awesome
party here last night and well,

19:58.546 --> 20:00.331
we broke your Frampton guitar.

20:01.068 --> 20:02.680
What's the funny part ?

20:03.655 --> 20:07.440
Well I was hoping that was the funny part
because I put the "ah ah" in there.

20:08.786 --> 20:10.901
It made me laugh.

20:15.515 --> 20:18.722
So while I was away,
you disobeyed my wishes,

20:18.755 --> 20:20.863
you used my house for a party

20:20.906 --> 20:23.892
and broke something that was
extremely valuable to me ?

20:25.608 --> 20:26.983
I have a son !

20:29.967 --> 20:32.363
- You're not mad ?
- No, of course not.

20:33.237 --> 20:35.301
Do I still get the Clapton guitar ?

20:35.335 --> 20:38.292
Oh hell, no. I can't trust you worth a damn.

20:40.827 --> 20:43.240
I have a confession to make too.

20:44.868 --> 20:48.050
I broke your toilet seat trying to reheat some pizza.

20:49.888 --> 20:52.611
Yeah and I peed in your pool.

20:53.716 --> 20:56.051
Leo, you weren't even at the party.

20:56.085 --> 20:58.663
I know that's why I peed in his pool.

21:04.108 --> 21:04.972
Towel,

21:07.706 --> 21:08.770
succion,

21:12.015 --> 21:15.743
ohhh... We're losing him.

21:23.758 --> 21:25.131
Time of death,

21:26.446 --> 21:27.993
8.29.

21:29.888 --> 21:32.372
Murdererrrrrrr !
