[ Earl Narrating ]
The local Bargain Bag was known
for its bad customer service,

00:08.609 --> 00:10.544
but we couldn't
really blame them for that.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.713
As a matter of fact,
they could blame us,

00:12.780 --> 00:16.850
and that's why we were here,
to make up for number 24
on my list--

00:16.917 --> 00:18.986

machine.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.589
I wanna thank you
for including us
on this list item, Earl.

00:21.655 --> 00:26.260
I appreciate any opportunity
to repent for my sinful days.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.930
- Oh! I want Jesus to see this.
- Is that who that is?

00:29.997 --> 00:31.565
Uh-huh.
I saw him
peeking out.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.534
- Thought it was
Willie Nelson.
- Next!

00:33.601 --> 00:39.173
Good-bye, little fella.
We never even gave you a name.

00:39.240 --> 00:43.344
Earl! You can't give back
that ticket thing.

00:43.411 --> 00:45.879

I have to. It's on my list.

00:45.946 --> 00:47.715
You can't.

00:50.618 --> 00:53.521
Oh, snap.

00:53.587 --> 00:57.191
[ Earl Narrating ] I understood
why Randy didn't wanna part
with that ticket machine.

00:57.258 --> 01:00.161
It meant a lot to him.
It meant a lot to all of us.

01:00.228 --> 01:02.563
It was Christmas 1999...

01:02.630 --> 01:05.933
and I had met and married
Joy only three weeks earlier.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.835
Since it was our first
holiday together,

01:07.901 --> 01:10.271
I wanted to include her in
our gang's yuletide traditions.

Hey, everyone!
It's carolers!

01:26.187 --> 01:28.889
While Donny, Randy
and Joy spread good tidings,

01:28.956 --> 01:30.824
I snuck in and robbed
the place.

01:43.837 --> 01:46.607
Are you Santa?

01:48.442 --> 01:52.846
Oh, ho-ho.
Why are you taking
all our presents?

01:55.849 --> 01:59.920
Well, I think if you thought
hard enough, you'd know
the answer to that.

01:59.987 --> 02:03.357

those dumb, stupid...

to buy a proper gift.

02:26.614 --> 02:30.818
Cool, it's one of them

smart people and gays.

02:30.884 --> 02:33.254

02:33.321 --> 02:35.456
Darnell. I'm new.

02:35.523 --> 02:39.227
[ Earl Narrating ]
A few weeks earlier, Darnell's
life took a dramatic turn...

02:39.293 --> 02:42.363
and he had to relocate
to Camden County.

02:44.232 --> 02:47.100
As soon as you get
out of this van,
you become Darnell Turner.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.371

Remember, you can never be
Harry Monroe again.
You're a totally new person.

- Not if you wanna stay alive
you don't.

03:12.260 --> 03:17.164
[ Earl Narrating ] The more we
hung out with Darnell, the more
we learned how smart he was.

03:17.231 --> 03:19.633
Why is it called "Y2K"?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.636
It means "2000" in computer,
and in a few days,
when it turns 2000,

03:22.703 --> 03:25.038
all the computers are gonna
think it's really Year Zero.

03:25.105 --> 03:28.609
- The hell does that mean?
- All the computers will go
berserk and things like...

03:28.676 --> 03:31.078

will be out.

03:31.144 --> 03:33.814
The banks will be outta money.
Stores will be outta food.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.117
All the high scores
on video games will be reset.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.019
- Even "Centipede"?
- Mm-hmm.

03:39.086 --> 03:42.189
That's messed up, y'all.
What the hell's gonna
happen to us?

03:42.256 --> 03:45.959
Well, we'll either be killed
at the hands of hungry citizens
or die of starvation.

03:46.026 --> 03:49.663
- Do we get to choose?
- Wh-Wh-What are we gonna do?

03:49.730 --> 03:52.065
We should do somethin', right?
I mean, we gotta do somethin'.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.603
Well, the best thing to do
is just hole up somewhere
and wait to see what happens.

03:55.669 --> 03:58.872
We can use my sister's basement.
She's off with another trucker.

03:58.939 --> 04:02.443
And does she go off
with a lot of truckers?

04:02.510 --> 04:05.513
My sister falls in love easy,
if that's what you're askin'.

04:05.579 --> 04:10.050
[ Earl Narrating ] As we all
tried to figure out how the hell
we were gonna survive Y2K,

04:10.117 --> 04:12.386

preparing for an uncertain
future.

In the days leading up
to Y2K,

04:37.711 --> 04:40.448
we decided to stock up
on survival supplies.

04:41.449 --> 04:44.618
And we weren't the only ones.

04:53.260 --> 04:56.564
Randy, I told you
no robot dogs.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.832
We can only afford
the things we need to survive.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.336
But I already filled out
the adoption papers.
I named him "Biscuit."

Shh.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.596
I'm gonna have to see
a receipt and pat you down.

05:28.662 --> 05:30.664
Does that mean I'm gonna
have to take my boots off?

05:30.731 --> 05:34.267
- Probably.
- The hell's goin' on?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.304
Sorry, honey. Now that
we're married, you're gonna
have to get used to this.

05:37.371 --> 05:40.340
For some reason,
people tend to think
me and Randy are criminals.

05:40.408 --> 05:43.944
I understand, baby.
Everywhere I go I get
dirty looks too.

05:44.011 --> 05:47.214
- So do I.
- Me too, and it sucks
because we're good people.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.783
Mm-hmm.

05:54.455 --> 05:57.357
You know, it's crazy.
They're so worried about us

- Mm-hmm.

Then why the hell
did we just buy
all this stuff?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.600
I'm gonna return mine
and steal it tomorrow.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.473
Can I loot too, Earl?
There's just so much
I wanna take.

06:12.540 --> 06:16.910
And, plus, I'm still
a little bit upset about
that Larry King verdict.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.913
You know what I'm gonna
loot first? I'm gonna
loot me a Humvee.

06:19.980 --> 06:22.916
Then I'm gonna take all
the other stuff I loot
and put it in my Humvee.

06:22.983 --> 06:26.386
And if somebody tries
to stop me, I'm gonna
drive over 'em in my Humvee.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.522
And I also want
a new pair of sandals.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.624
Hey, Darnell, if all
the computers break,

06:30.691 --> 06:32.893
does that mean we won't
have criminal records anymore?

Yep. It'll be cool.

was that every year...

07:30.784 --> 07:33.153
Camden County had
a New Year's fireworks show.

We'd never seen it
because we were usually
passed out by 9:00.

like grenades.
- Grenades?

07:40.260 --> 07:42.362

I only have this bat.

I could hit a grenade
with the bat, but only
if you put it on a tee.

in the mornin'.

It's our stuff.
I don't think so.

13:18.298 --> 13:20.367
I'm a separate accounts
kind of woman.

13:20.433 --> 13:22.769
If you want something,
you're gonna have to
give me something for it.

13:22.836 --> 13:26.840
You want three bags
of slightly licked
outsides of cookies?

13:26.907 --> 13:29.142
I want a TV.

13:29.209 --> 13:31.611
How am I supposed to get you
a TV? I live in Snack Foods.

13:31.678 --> 13:33.813
Figure it out.

13:44.424 --> 13:48.228
- Hey, Donny, what
can I trade you for a TV?
- Give me your wife.

13:48.295 --> 13:51.064
I'm not givin' you my wife.
Pick a snack food.

13:51.131 --> 13:55.568
Marshmallow Fluff--
smeared on your wife.

13:55.635 --> 13:58.171
- Donny.
- Okay.

13:58.238 --> 14:02.142
I'll give you a TV,
but you gotta owe me
one favor--

14:02.209 --> 14:04.344
and I get to ask for that
favor anytime I want...

14:04.411 --> 14:08.181
and you can't say "no"
and you can't ask
what the favor's gonna be.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.583
Is the favor givin' you
my wife?

14:10.650 --> 14:13.653
- Yep.
- Forget it.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.856
[ Earl Narrating ]
While Donny Jones
was hard to negotiate with,

14:16.924 --> 14:18.959
he was easy to fool.

14:34.807 --> 14:38.946
Oh, so there's crime now.

[ Machinery Popping ]

14:46.186 --> 14:48.788
- What the hell
are you doin'?
- You took my TV!

14:48.855 --> 14:50.958
I saw it on TV.

14:52.825 --> 14:56.096
I know we can go
and fish and hunt.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.999

Who's my good boy? You are.

But you got 16 left.
- Thief!

- What the hell is goin' on?
- Shut up! You belong to me now.

You're not gettin'
my wife, Donny.

Oh, snap! You killed
your own brother!

15:30.263 --> 15:33.533
I claim the toy section!

15:38.338 --> 15:40.407
[ Earl Narrating ]
Things had gotten
out of control...

15:40.473 --> 15:45.112
and it was gonna take a lot
more than frozen peas to fix
the problems in our new world.

15:45.178 --> 15:48.881
What the hell's the matter
with us? How can we start
a whole new world...

15:48.948 --> 15:50.984
if we can't even get
through a day without...

15:51.051 --> 15:53.053
having a tennis ball
and pumpkin pie filling war.

15:53.120 --> 15:57.290
It's 'cause we ain't got
no damn rules. We need to figure
a way to settle this fightin'.

15:57.357 --> 16:00.160
I know. We institute
a scalpin' policy.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.329
Whenever two people argue,
they both get scalped.

16:03.930 --> 16:07.334
Randy, where are you goin'?
We're makin' important
decisions here.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.270
- Randy, I'm talkin' to you.
- I say we scalp him.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.739
- We're not scalpin' him.
- We could cut off his ear.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.607
You know what? Maybe buildin'
a new world's too much.

16:14.674 --> 16:16.643
We're just a bunch
of low-life criminals.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.512
No wonder everybody
gives us dirty looks
all the time.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.648
We don't have to
argue anymore.
We can use this.

16:21.714 --> 16:24.384
- The hell is that?
- It's a take-a-number thingy.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.853
Ooh! Like they have
at the free clinic.

16:26.919 --> 16:32.425
We just take a number. Whenever
we have to make a decision,
the next number decides.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.461
That way there won't be
wars in our new world.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.164
[ Earl Narrating ]
Funny thing. It took
a smack to the head...

16:37.230 --> 16:39.199
to finally knock
some sense into one of us.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.939
While Randy was helping us
get to a better place,

16:47.006 --> 16:50.310
a guy named Pablo was helping
Catalina do the same thing.

16:50.377 --> 16:53.346
License and registration.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.763
Right away we knew
we were onto something
with the take-a-number machine.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.966
Whenever we would disagree,
we went straight to the numbers.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.236
Whoever had the lowest number
got their way.

17:33.386 --> 17:36.589
The number thingy
really helped us get along.

17:42.429 --> 17:46.065
We stopped arguin'
and started havin' fun.

17:46.133 --> 17:48.335
Our new society
was really comin' together.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.042
We were the best
we'd ever been.

17:56.109 --> 17:59.679
- To us.
- [ All ] To us!

17:59.746 --> 18:01.781
And to Randy.

18:01.848 --> 18:03.950
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

18:04.016 --> 18:07.220
Good job finding that

18:09.622 --> 18:11.524
You know what kind
of thinkin' that was?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.760
The kind of thinkin'
a president does.

18:13.826 --> 18:17.564
- But we don't have
any presidents.
- Well, maybe we need one.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.099
All in favor of Randy
bein' president--

18:23.069 --> 18:25.205

18:25.272 --> 18:27.640
That means
I'm on top.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.942
[ Earl Narrating ]
By bedtime, we were exhausted,

18:30.009 --> 18:32.078
but mostly, we were proud.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.281
Thanks to Randy's
ticket machine,

18:34.347 --> 18:36.383
we had done good on our
first day of runnin' the world.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.751
If people were still alive
to see us,

18:38.818 --> 18:41.554
they sure wouldn't
have been givin' us
dirty looks that night.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.457
Hey, Mr. President.
[ Randy ]
Yeah, Earl?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.759
How's it feel
to be on top?

18:46.826 --> 18:50.197
I don't like it.
It's too high up here.
Will you switch with me?

18:50.263 --> 18:52.899
Sure, Randy.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.640
So, we all went to sleep...

19:00.707 --> 19:03.676
proud of ourselves
and looking forward to what
the next day would bring.

But, unfortunately,
the next day brought shoppers...

19:12.919 --> 19:17.257
ready to take advantage
of Bargain Bag's
January 2 Sale.

19:17.324 --> 19:20.860
Turns out the world
wasn't over like we thought.

19:20.927 --> 19:23.963
The deck wasn't reshuffled
and we were still on the bottom.

19:24.030 --> 19:26.899
Nothin' had changed
at all.

19:40.146 --> 19:42.715
Unfortunately,
our new world was over,

19:42.782 --> 19:45.184
but a new world was just
beginning for Catalina...

So, six years later,

20:01.401 --> 20:03.703
Bargain Bag still needed
their take-a-number machine,

20:03.770 --> 20:06.639
and no matter how Randy felt,
I still needed to give it
back to 'em.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.808
It's my turn, Earl.
I get to choose.

20:08.875 --> 20:12.044
Randy, look.
That number machine means
something to all of us,

20:12.111 --> 20:14.914
but if we keep it,
then we're just crooks
who stole a number machine.

20:14.981 --> 20:18.251
That's not what
that day was about.
But we were on top.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.887
I liked bein' on top.
Don't worry, Randy.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.390
If we just keep doin'
the things on my list,

20:23.456 --> 20:26.559
we'll be back on top
before you know it.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.613

And even though we're
still looked down upon today,

20:46.679 --> 20:49.081
I'm confident that,
one day, we won't be.

20:49.148 --> 20:53.252
One day we will be seen
as the perfect people we were
