WEBVTT

00:19.936 --> 00:21.395
What's that noise?

00:21.395 --> 00:24.232
It's the waves crashing
on the beach.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.030
Since when do oceans hum?

00:36.827 --> 00:37.870
Wait.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.249
A guy and his coworker
found her this morning.

01:28.212 --> 01:31.799
Well, they've obviously cleaned the
room before they checked in, right?

01:31.799 --> 01:33.509
Yeah, typical maid service -

01:33.509 --> 01:35.011
Scrub the surface.

01:35.011 --> 01:37.722
Scrubbed the surface but
left the dead body under the bed.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.600
So what do we know
about our previous occupant?

01:40.600 --> 01:43.311
No face-to-face booking.
Sent the victim to pay.

01:43.311 --> 01:45.062
And who is our victim?

01:45.062 --> 01:46.981
Pocketbook and clothes
were missing but ...

01:46.981 --> 01:49.692
the assistant coroner okayed
a live scan of her prints.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.028
Susan McCreary.

01:52.028 --> 01:54.322
A string of priors
for prostitution.

01:56.991 --> 01:58.743
Looks like she
was working the street.

01:59.452 --> 02:00.494
Not anymore.

02:36.948 --> 02:40.076
1x12 Entrance Wound

02:54.780 --> 02:56.699
Seventy-five degrees.

02:56.699 --> 02:58.451
With her liver temp...

02:58.451 --> 03:01.579
that puts time of death between
seven and nine last evening.

03:05.166 --> 03:09.879
Victim was stabbed repeatedly.
Slim, sharp implement.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.840
What do you think?
A knife or scissors?

03:12.840 --> 03:14.717
Width of the wounds
could match either.

03:16.052 --> 03:17.887
She wasn't stabbed under here.

03:17.887 --> 03:20.181
There's not enough room,
and there's no blood present.

03:20.681 --> 03:22.683
On the bed's the
next logical choice.

03:22.683 --> 03:24.810
Yes, but there would be
spatter on the night stand...

03:24.810 --> 03:26.312
and the wall and
the sheets would be soaked.

03:26.312 --> 03:28.356
I got the sheets from the maid.

03:28.356 --> 03:31.442
There's no visible stains,
but I bagged them anyway.

03:31.442 --> 03:33.653
Bag that bedspread,
too, will you?

03:39.450 --> 03:40.910
What do we have here?

04:05.685 --> 04:06.727
That's blood ...

04:07.812 --> 04:09.480
and somebody tried
to wipe it away.

04:13.776 --> 04:15.820
Not the only surface
he scrubbed.

04:16.737 --> 04:18.822
Body smells like cardamom.

04:19.531 --> 04:22.869
It's a spice. I use it in a
mean South African curry...

04:22.869 --> 04:26.372
but it's also used
as a scent in soaps.

04:27.165 --> 04:28.207
Scented soaps.

04:30.168 --> 04:31.210
Okay.

04:33.254 --> 04:34.630
The maid did say that....

04:34.630 --> 04:37.049
the renter boosted a couple
of towels and a washcloth.

04:37.049 --> 04:38.467
What about used soap?

04:38.467 --> 04:39.969
Yeah, he took that with him, too.

04:39.969 --> 04:41.846
You know what?
Let's green-light this tub.

04:52.231 --> 04:53.274
Cardamom soap.

05:02.325 --> 05:03.326
Whoa.

05:03.951 --> 05:04.994
You got something?

05:06.037 --> 05:09.165
Yeah. It looks like
he washed her.

05:13.377 --> 05:16.380
That would explain the clean body
and the missing towels, wouldn't it?

05:17.215 --> 05:19.217
Well, he didn't hose these.

05:19.217 --> 05:21.260
Uniform found them
in a dumpster outside.

05:24.180 --> 05:26.182
Well, I guess they
could be the victim's.

05:26.182 --> 05:27.517
They fit the lifestyle.

05:27.517 --> 05:30.645
Don't worry. Officer Saxon
didn't touch anything else.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.440
We'll take it from here,
gentlemen.

05:38.694 --> 05:40.738
I guess I got to go
check the dumpster now.

05:40.738 --> 05:41.781
Do that next.

06:09.892 --> 06:11.435
Hey, what do we got?

06:12.186 --> 06:15.314
Attempted carjacking
or robbery.

06:15.523 --> 06:18.317
German tourist couple.
They stopped for directions.

06:18.317 --> 06:20.486
Now, that's the wife,
Greta Roebling.

06:20.486 --> 06:24.532
Husband's Werner and they're here
on a short vacation from Stuttgart.

06:25.408 --> 06:28.744
Oh, another slam from
the European Press.

06:28.744 --> 06:30.830
"Miami: Deathtrap
Under the Palms."

06:31.831 --> 06:32.748
Did the wife
see the shooting?

06:32.748 --> 06:35.084
No. She said a masked man
approached her side of the car ...

06:35.084 --> 06:36.919
and then shot
her husband.

06:36.919 --> 06:37.879
Body's still in the car?

06:37.879 --> 06:41.757
No. Husband fled,
shooter ran after him ...

06:42.884 --> 06:45.803
... and he left his body on
the floor of the garage bay.

06:45.803 --> 06:47.972
Well, if it's a carjacking,

06:47.972 --> 06:51.309
why chase a guy who's
already abandoned his car?

06:51.309 --> 06:52.143
Exactly.

06:52.143 --> 06:53.769
That's the first of many questions.

06:53.769 --> 06:56.147
How about I take the car,
you take the garage and

06:56.147 --> 06:58.107
we'll meet up at the body
when the M.E. shows up?

06:58.107 --> 06:59.150
Sounds good.

07:40.566 --> 07:43.152
I got blood spatter
in the car but no bullets.

07:43.152 --> 07:46.447
Also, got a smear
on the rearview mirror.

07:46.447 --> 07:47.698
There's no sign
of the M.E.?

07:48.366 --> 07:50.493
No. Stuck on the
Venetian Causeway.

07:50.493 --> 07:52.578
The bridge wouldn't close.
Would you believe?

07:53.538 --> 07:55.373
So how many times
was this guy shot?

07:56.332 --> 07:58.501
I'm only seeing one wound.

07:58.501 --> 08:02.880
A small entrance behind the ear
possible exit through the mouth.

08:03.256 --> 08:05.591
Gosh, it's hard to imagine
him running all the way ...

08:05.591 --> 08:06.843
in here with a
shot in the head.

08:07.426 --> 08:08.719
Anything's possible.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.137
Did you find any
bullets in here?

08:10.137 --> 08:12.640
No, but check out
these blood patterns.

08:15.685 --> 08:20.815
Now, it doesn't look like a shoe but,
uh, it's hard to say where it's from.

08:20.815 --> 08:24.569
And the spatter on the back
of this truck is even harder to place.

08:26.320 --> 08:28.197
Looks like high velocity
from a gunshot.

08:30.575 --> 08:35.163
Well, that would put a second shot in
here and that doesn't track with the body.

08:35.580 --> 08:39.292
Or with his head wound
in relation to the truck.

08:39.292 --> 08:41.586
Aah, we need to get
at this body.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.131
Twenty-three stab
wounds in all.

08:45.131 --> 08:46.674
Some of them
look tentative.

08:46.966 --> 08:48.593
Till he got the hang of it.

08:48.593 --> 08:51.637
Yeah. The majority of the wounds
are deep penetrations.

08:52.555 --> 08:53.931
What's your cause of death?

08:53.931 --> 08:57.602
Exsanguination from a sharp
force injury that severed the aorta.

08:57.602 --> 08:59.687
Not much external
blood loss, though, huh?

08:59.687 --> 09:02.398
Right. Aorta bleeds out
into the chest cavity.

09:07.320 --> 09:09.405
Which would have helped
the killer with his cleanup.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.866
You think he could have
known that?

09:13.534 --> 09:15.077
You find him and ask him.

09:19.749 --> 09:20.875
Adhesive, right?

09:21.167 --> 09:23.794
Yeah. Wrist,
ankles and mouth.

09:23.794 --> 09:27.423
Okay, so he picked her up
gagged her, taped her, went to town.

09:28.508 --> 09:29.967
How about
sexual assault?

09:32.094 --> 09:34.805
No vaginal tearing,
no signs of semen.

09:34.805 --> 09:39.185
Guy went to a lot of trouble for
no apparent personal or sexual motive.

09:39.185 --> 09:41.270
How about the joy
of just taking a life?

09:42.647 --> 09:45.441
That's always good.
Okay.

09:47.151 --> 09:48.903
Anything else from
the dumpster?

09:48.903 --> 09:50.279
Just the victim's clothes.

09:51.030 --> 09:54.450
Pipes from the tub were a bust.
I found traces of drain cleaner.

09:55.076 --> 09:57.161
So it would have dissolved
any DNA he might have left.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.877
What about right here?
Right in the center.

10:05.294 --> 10:06.879
I'm about to test it.

10:07.797 --> 10:10.591
Never go naked on
the hotel bedspread.

10:10.591 --> 10:13.052
Lucky for us, some
people do, right?

10:13.052 --> 10:15.763
Keep me posted.
I'll go check her personal effects.

10:45.793 --> 10:48.254
The smear on the center
of the bedspread was mold.

10:48.254 --> 10:50.423
A type that wasn't on
anything else at the bungalow.

10:50.423 --> 10:52.466
Maybe the killer
brought it in with him.

10:52.884 --> 10:55.303
But not off his body.

10:55.303 --> 10:57.805
Could be transfer from some kind of
cover he used to keep the mess down.

10:57.805 --> 10:59.473
He did get sloppy
about one thing.

10:59.473 --> 11:01.559
We found a bloody fingerprint
on the victim's belt.

11:01.851 --> 11:02.894
Guy in the system?

11:02.894 --> 11:06.522
A Cole Judson. A prior knife assault
on a woman twelve years ago.

11:07.148 --> 11:08.274
Not his first time.

11:08.274 --> 11:09.650
Let's make it his last.

11:17.824 --> 11:19.534
Excuse me.

11:19.534 --> 11:21.285
We're looking
for Cole Judson.

11:21.911 --> 11:26.457
Um, yeah, he's probably out back
helping me out with my fence.

11:26.457 --> 11:27.458
Does he work for you?

11:27.458 --> 11:29.585
No. I'm the landlord.

11:29.585 --> 11:33.464
This guy pulls in six figures and his
way to unwind is hacking at wood.

11:33.464 --> 11:36.426
Go figure.
You guys the police?

11:36.426 --> 11:37.844
Yes, we are.

11:38.136 --> 11:39.595
Where would that be?

11:39.595 --> 11:42.181
Right around back.
Just follow the screams.

11:42.181 --> 11:45.852
His step-kids believe
in expressing themselves.

11:46.436 --> 11:47.478
Thank you.

11:54.485 --> 11:55.528
Cole Judson?

11:56.112 --> 11:58.156
Detective Brunner,
Miami-Dade police.

11:58.156 --> 11:59.782
Horatio Caine, CSI.

11:59.782 --> 12:02.076
You're under arrest for
the murder of Susan McCreary.

12:03.286 --> 12:04.287
You have the right
to remain silent.

12:04.287 --> 12:05.038
Cole?

12:05.038 --> 12:07.623
Anything you say can be used
against you in the Court Hall...

12:07.623 --> 12:09.417
What are they doing?
Wendy, call our lawyer.

12:09.417 --> 12:10.168
Cole?

12:10.168 --> 12:12.211
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford ...

12:12.211 --> 12:13.588
Everything's going to be okay.

12:13.588 --> 12:15.089
The court will appoint you one.

12:15.089 --> 12:18.217
What are you doing?
Cole would never hurt anyone.

12:18.217 --> 12:20.887
Mrs. Judson, your husband will be
transported downtown...

12:20.887 --> 12:22.138
where he will be booked.

12:22.138 --> 12:26.017
In the meantime, I have a
warrant to search your residence.

12:30.605 --> 12:32.148
This, this can't be right.

12:33.608 --> 12:34.734
You're wrong.

12:40.657 --> 12:41.824
There's our shooter.

12:42.158 --> 12:45.286
Yeah, with a mask
leaving us no facial ID.

12:45.578 --> 12:48.665
But I can ID our
odd print on the floor.

12:49.957 --> 12:51.751
Perforations on the glove...

12:51.751 --> 12:54.337
appear to match the pattern
we found in that blood smear.

12:59.592 --> 13:01.386
So the shooter lost his footing.

13:01.886 --> 13:03.763
Which confirms the wife's story.

13:04.097 --> 13:07.475
The shooter approached her side
of the car and shot the husband.

13:07.475 --> 13:10.061
But we still can't see where
the husband was hit.

13:11.729 --> 13:15.608
Oh, it's riveting but what I really
want is a call from Alexx.

13:15.608 --> 13:18.861
Easy, girl.
You will get your bullet.

13:19.153 --> 13:22.240
Sorry, Calleigh. Your second
bullet was fragmented.

13:22.991 --> 13:26.536
It's a small caliber "22",
probably.

13:27.954 --> 13:30.498
There's no hope for a
comparison.

13:30.498 --> 13:34.669
But the good news is
I've got your first bullet.

13:36.838 --> 13:38.715
He was shot in the mouth?

13:46.055 --> 13:47.223
Oh, yeah.

13:49.308 --> 13:52.770
Well, I have never seen
anything like this before.

13:53.187 --> 13:55.690
Never forget your
first time, do you?

13:55.690 --> 13:57.775
It's intact,
that's a good sign.

13:57.775 --> 14:00.111
Came to rest in the
back of his throat.

14:00.111 --> 14:03.448
That would explain all the blood
spatter on the back of the truck.

14:03.448 --> 14:05.742
He would have been spitting cupfuls
of blood with a wound like that.

14:05.742 --> 14:10.204
Over forty arteries and veins inside
the oral pharynx and the buccal mucosa.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.044
He was hiding from his killer.

14:55.249 --> 14:56.334
Who's this?

14:57.377 --> 14:58.670
That's the ex-husband.

14:59.212 --> 15:00.254
Hmm ...

15:01.381 --> 15:05.343
the ex-husband.
That's interesting.

15:06.386 --> 15:08.971
I'll keep them for a few days,
all right, Wendy? Don't worry.

15:08.971 --> 15:12.100
This is a mistake, Michael.
It, it's crazy.

15:13.142 --> 15:16.145
Anytime, the middle of the
night 5:00 in the morning,

15:16.145 --> 15:18.398
I'm there for you, okay?
If you need me.

15:18.398 --> 15:19.732
If there's anything I can do ...

15:19.732 --> 15:21.818
We'll let you know.
Thank you.

15:21.818 --> 15:23.027
Bye, sweetie.

15:26.155 --> 15:28.116
Are you aware that your
husband has a record...

15:28.116 --> 15:29.450
for a knife assault
on a woman?

15:30.952 --> 15:34.747
No, that's not right.
It can't be.

15:34.747 --> 15:36.833
Cole could never do what
you're accusing him of.

15:36.833 --> 15:38.501
Can you tell us where
he was last night?

15:38.501 --> 15:41.087
He was, he was at his
weekly sales meeting.

15:41.087 --> 15:42.755
Every Wednesday till 9:00.

15:42.755 --> 15:44.382
Could you give us
a contact at his office?

15:44.382 --> 15:45.675
Yeah. Let me get it.

15:45.967 --> 15:46.926
Thank you.

15:49.012 --> 15:50.304
Surprise, surprise.

15:50.304 --> 15:51.305
What's up?

15:51.305 --> 15:55.268
Cole Judson didn't work late
on Wednesday. He never does.

15:55.685 --> 15:59.981
So he's two for two
on lies to his wife.

16:01.524 --> 16:02.567
Okay.

16:02.984 --> 16:05.028
Please, you have
to believe me.

16:05.028 --> 16:07.655
I don't know what you found,
but you're wrong.

16:08.281 --> 16:09.824
What happened to your finger?

16:10.533 --> 16:14.370
I whacked my nail. Henry,
the little one, put this on me.

16:14.704 --> 16:15.872
Mind if I take a look at it?

16:15.872 --> 16:17.332
Yeah, sure.

16:19.417 --> 16:22.670
The band-aid?
Band-aid. Thank you.

16:23.713 --> 16:25.173
Where were you last night?

16:25.173 --> 16:27.091
After work I took
a walk on the beach.

16:27.091 --> 16:28.176
It's what I do every
Wednesday.

16:28.176 --> 16:29.635
That's not what
your wife told us.

16:35.975 --> 16:37.310
Listen, I ...

16:38.144 --> 16:41.564
I love being married, I do.
And I adore those kids.

16:42.190 --> 16:44.359
But I steal one night
a week for myself and I ...

16:45.109 --> 16:47.945
I should have been honest
with Wendy about needing it.

16:48.446 --> 16:50.531
What about the girl you
stabbed in college?

16:51.991 --> 16:53.993
Oh, my god, Beth?

16:55.078 --> 16:56.454
I never hurt Beth.

16:57.038 --> 16:59.207
Listen, we were young
and we were drunk,

16:59.207 --> 17:01.626
and we were arguing
and she cut herself.

17:01.626 --> 17:05.046
I took her to the ER to get stitches.
They had to file a report.

17:05.672 --> 17:07.339
Suddenly she was worried
about what her family...

17:07.339 --> 17:09.342
would say so she said I did it.

17:13.179 --> 17:15.682
Do you, um,
recognize this woman?

17:20.435 --> 17:22.230
No.
No?

17:24.315 --> 17:25.316
No.

17:28.778 --> 17:29.821
Excuse me.

17:50.550 --> 17:54.137
Well, our gas station bullet matched a
prior convenience store robbery.

17:54.137 --> 17:55.388
The gun was never recovered.

17:55.388 --> 17:57.056
The adult was convicted,

17:57.056 --> 17:59.892
he's still behind bars but
the juvenile accomplice,

17:59.892 --> 18:02.812
Malcolm Davidson,
served only a few months.

18:02.812 --> 18:04.314
All right, so where's
Malcolm now?

18:04.314 --> 18:06.316
At home, with grandma.

18:09.319 --> 18:12.613
I'm telling you wherever
you think Malcolm was...

18:12.613 --> 18:13.865
he was out
with me.

18:14.198 --> 18:16.701
I'm not finding any
of those clothes.

18:19.287 --> 18:21.456
Hey, Calleigh come
take a look in here.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.293
You find the gun?

18:25.293 --> 18:26.711
No, even better.

18:28.254 --> 18:29.922
Originally seen on video.

18:30.757 --> 18:33.551
Rinsed off and stiff
from drying, too.

18:33.551 --> 18:35.928
With perforations
that look very similar...

18:35.928 --> 18:38.306
to that blood pattern we
found on the garage floor.

18:42.143 --> 18:43.353
All right, let's go.

18:44.270 --> 18:46.397
No way my brother did this.

18:47.774 --> 18:49.484
Okay, so I'm the killer and...

18:49.484 --> 18:51.611
I've just wiped down the scene,

18:51.611 --> 18:55.531
and I'm preparing to dispose of
the victim's clothes but somehow,

18:55.531 --> 18:58.326
some of the victim's blood has
escaped my cleanup, right?

18:58.785 --> 18:59.535
Beef blood?

18:59.535 --> 19:03.081
Yup. Close to human
but not a biohazard.

19:03.831 --> 19:08.836
So, this is how the print ...

19:08.836 --> 19:10.380
... should look on the belt.

19:10.922 --> 19:12.173
But take a look at the picture.

19:15.843 --> 19:17.720
Looks the same,
like the print you made.

19:17.720 --> 19:21.974
Ah, but it's not because it wasn't
made with a bloody fingerprint.

19:23.393 --> 19:26.437
It was made with oil.

19:27.814 --> 19:28.898
Like this.

19:32.026 --> 19:35.154
And the blood was applied ...

19:36.447 --> 19:37.323
later. Like this.

19:41.035 --> 19:46.249
Allowing the blood to slide off
the ridges and pool in the furrows.

19:47.250 --> 19:48.376
Take a look.

19:50.878 --> 19:54.215
Wow. Never seen
anything like that.

19:54.924 --> 19:56.175
I guess you'd miss it
if you didn't know it.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.302
That's right.
So it pays to stay current.

19:58.302 --> 19:59.846
Remember the
criminalist from Taos?

20:00.096 --> 20:02.056
The one with the long,
black hair?

20:02.056 --> 20:04.058
She did a study and this...

20:04.058 --> 20:06.978
is how you can frame somebody
with their own fingerprint.

20:06.978 --> 20:08.730
What did the state's
attorney say ...

20:08.730 --> 20:10.315
when you called them and told
them they had the wrong guy?

20:10.315 --> 20:13.151
Well, he said it was a very,
very interesting study.

20:14.527 --> 20:15.945
So he's ignoring the science.

20:15.945 --> 20:17.322
Right, and here's why --

20:17.322 --> 20:20.742
because people understand fingerprints
and he is not going to confuse a jury ...

20:20.742 --> 20:22.410
over one study.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.830
So Cole Judson ...

20:26.456 --> 20:27.915
Is looking at murder one.

20:33.214 --> 20:36.968
Now, I believe that the killer
left the print behind intentionally,

20:36.968 --> 20:39.429
but he left this
behind by mistake.

20:39.429 --> 20:41.264
That's my mold from
the bungalow.

20:41.264 --> 20:42.599
Cladosporium,

20:42.599 --> 20:46.895
is a dark mold commonly found in indoor
water space like Cole Judson's bathroom.

20:46.895 --> 20:51.066
Now, this is the mold
from the shower curtain.

20:52.358 --> 20:54.819
Mold from his bathroom
matches the bungalow?

20:54.819 --> 20:55.612
Mmm.

20:55.612 --> 20:57.822
It's not looking good for Cole.

20:57.822 --> 20:59.115
That's true.

20:59.115 --> 21:01.910
But cladosporium is a
common genus and species,

21:01.910 --> 21:04.537
and that would be like saying
the killer's a homo sapien.

21:04.537 --> 21:06.206
So, in order to clear
Cole Judson...

21:06.206 --> 21:09.125
we have to distill this mold down
to the equivalent of a human name.

21:13.046 --> 21:16.216
You're trying to identify
the DNA of the mold?

21:16.216 --> 21:17.217
Yes, I am,

21:17.217 --> 21:19.594
which would mean the smear from the
bungalow could only come...

21:19.594 --> 21:22.764
from a single host colony
like the killer's bathroom.

21:23.348 --> 21:25.058
Mold's a primitive organism.

21:25.058 --> 21:27.268
But if it's biological,
it has DNA.

21:27.685 --> 21:31.439
Yeah, but still isolating DNA is ...

21:32.524 --> 21:33.566
is going to be rough.

21:34.275 --> 21:37.737
Not as rough as leaving an
innocent man to do time on death row.

21:39.406 --> 21:40.281
Hey.
Hey.

21:41.241 --> 21:43.201
You should have gone
for Malcolm's closet.

21:44.285 --> 21:46.371
Driving glove I found
was a major score.

21:46.704 --> 21:49.249
Yeah, blood was the
German husband's,

21:49.249 --> 21:52.460
epithelia's match Malcolm and
there was a waxy substance.

21:52.460 --> 21:53.837
A waxy substance?

21:53.837 --> 21:55.296
On the glove?

21:58.425 --> 22:01.302
"Castor oil,
triglyceride, lanolin,

22:01.302 --> 22:03.930
heptan-2-one red
number six barium."

22:04.639 --> 22:08.518
I couldn't locate the brand or the
manufacturer but it's definitely lipstick.

22:09.269 --> 22:10.311
Probably grandma's.

22:15.525 --> 22:18.319
You know, it's bad enough when
you're in that awkward stage...

22:18.319 --> 22:19.612
between boy and
cold-blooded killer,

22:19.612 --> 22:23.450
but it's even worse when grandma's
kiss links you to the scene.

22:23.825 --> 22:24.659
Are you kidding me?

22:24.659 --> 22:27.287
I found the same lipstick on
the German's rearview mirror.

22:28.121 --> 22:30.331
So that doesn't just
put him at the scene.

22:30.957 --> 22:33.251
That puts Malcolm
inside their rental car.

22:33.668 --> 22:36.212
Except we have the whole
crime scene on video ...

22:36.212 --> 22:37.881
and Malcolm never sets
foot in the car.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.508
Okay, so it had to
happen before the crime.

22:40.508 --> 22:42.510
But what was he doing
in their front seat?

22:50.185 --> 22:52.896
I don't know.
And who was he sitting with?

22:54.981 --> 22:57.901
Christian, you
get my message?

22:58.318 --> 23:00.236
You think Cole Judson
is being framed.

23:01.112 --> 23:02.530
Any reason someone
would want to do that?

23:02.530 --> 23:04.616
Oh, probably because they
don't want to get caught ...

23:04.616 --> 23:06.284
or they're trying
to ruin his life.

23:06.284 --> 23:09.245
It's a theory or two.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.831
I'm awaiting a mold smear.

23:11.831 --> 23:14.209
Mold smear?
We got a bloody print.

23:14.209 --> 23:16.920
Yes, but we believe the
blood was applied later ...

23:16.920 --> 23:18.338
and that the print
is a forgery.

23:18.338 --> 23:20.048
How do you forge
someone's print?

23:20.048 --> 23:22.675
Well, you get them to stick
their finger into something soft,

23:22.675 --> 23:26.846
you let it harden you fill it with epoxy,
and then you duplicate the print.

23:26.846 --> 23:28.431
Without their knowledge?

23:28.848 --> 23:30.558
Or you could use
an existing print.

23:30.558 --> 23:32.060
From the print store?

23:32.060 --> 23:35.188
Everyday things:
Tile grout, Clay.

23:35.730 --> 23:37.107
You might be surprised.

23:38.066 --> 23:41.903
Mr. Judson, who has
access to your apartment?

23:42.195 --> 23:44.614
Wendy and I --
we rent --

23:44.614 --> 23:47.033
so I guess the building manager
or our cleaning lady.

23:47.033 --> 23:49.494
Okay, I guess what I'm
asking is who has keys to it?

23:49.494 --> 23:51.704
What does my apartment
have to do with anything?

23:53.373 --> 23:57.836
For right now why don't you let
me worry about that, okay?

23:58.545 --> 24:01.423
You know, I wish I could but
I'm going through hell,

24:01.423 --> 24:02.924
and I didn't do anything.

24:02.924 --> 24:04.384
So I give you our friends,

24:04.384 --> 24:07.011
our cleaning lady's name and what,
they're here instead of me?

24:07.011 --> 24:10.473
Okay, the thing is is that
they might be able to help you.

24:10.807 --> 24:11.516
How?

24:12.434 --> 24:14.227
I don't even know
what you're looking for.

24:16.688 --> 24:20.108
Does anyone have
a reason to frame you?

24:21.776 --> 24:22.861
No.

24:22.861 --> 24:24.821
You see, what I'm
trying to determine is...

24:24.821 --> 24:27.031
whether somebody gained
access to your apartment...

24:27.031 --> 24:29.534
and took something
without your knowledge.

24:31.911 --> 24:35.665
Wendy's ex-husband
doesn't have keys,

24:35.665 --> 24:38.626
but we came home one day and
found him inside the apartment.

24:39.544 --> 24:40.879
Did he have a reason
to be there?

24:40.879 --> 24:42.881
Not at that moment, no.

24:46.676 --> 24:50.013
I brought the kids home,
Henry was sick so I put him in bed.

24:50.013 --> 24:52.098
That's not what Cole
and the ex-wife say.

24:52.390 --> 24:54.058
They say you didn't have
custody that day.

24:55.977 --> 24:58.063
Okay.
All right.

25:00.982 --> 25:03.276
I told the landlady
I left my car keys.

25:03.276 --> 25:04.861
She let me in,
and I looked around.

25:04.861 --> 25:06.071
What were you
looking for?

25:07.113 --> 25:09.991
Drugs, pornography.

25:09.991 --> 25:13.411
Wendy married this guy just three
days after our divorce was final.

25:13.703 --> 25:15.497
She just met him
five months before that.

25:15.497 --> 25:17.832
Where were you Wednesday
night between six and nine P.M.?

25:17.832 --> 25:18.875
Me?

25:21.044 --> 25:22.837
I was at a cocktail party
for a colleague.

25:23.713 --> 25:26.174
We set up around six P.M.
And I was home shortly after nine.

25:26.174 --> 25:27.967
Can anyone confirm your
presence at the party?

25:27.967 --> 25:29.010
Everyone.

25:30.053 --> 25:31.387
I was the toastmaster.

25:34.974 --> 25:38.436
The only surprise there is the
ex didn't find a stash of violent porn.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.480
So you think his alibi is
going to clear him, huh?

25:40.480 --> 25:42.107
Read the M.E.'S report again.

25:42.107 --> 25:43.858
She was killed at
approximately seven P.M.

25:43.858 --> 25:45.860
Approximately seven P.M.

25:45.860 --> 25:48.488
Time of death is always the
most fluid aspect of any crime.

25:48.488 --> 25:51.741
I mean, even you
should know that.

25:57.205 --> 25:59.916
Now, Cole's fingerprint aside...

25:59.916 --> 26:03.670
the only thing that ties him to the
crime and clears the ex ...

26:05.046 --> 26:06.631
is time of death, right?

26:07.257 --> 26:10.009
Established by the victim's
liver temperature.

26:10.009 --> 26:11.761
Which brings us
to room temperature.

26:12.220 --> 26:14.806
When we entered the room
it was 75 degrees, correct?

26:14.806 --> 26:16.683
Perfect for humans
and orchids.

26:16.683 --> 26:17.976
Cells look healthy.

26:17.976 --> 26:21.020
As they should at 75 degrees.
But take a look at these cells.

26:21.020 --> 26:22.355
They don't look healthy.

26:22.355 --> 26:25.692
And the reason they're not
healthy is because like her body,

26:25.692 --> 26:26.735
they were chilled.

26:27.485 --> 26:30.780
Causing the cells to burst
and the petals to close.

26:30.780 --> 26:32.741
At fifty degrees or below.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.869
So somebody went in and
cranked the air conditioning.

26:39.622 --> 26:42.709
Reentered the room reset
the temperature of the room...

26:42.709 --> 26:45.712
there by changing
the time of the crime.

26:55.430 --> 26:57.098
I recognize no one.

26:57.974 --> 27:01.936
The shooter
wore a snow mask.

27:01.936 --> 27:05.023
Do you know anyone who would
want to hurt you or your husband?

27:05.023 --> 27:07.275
We know no one in Miami.

27:07.275 --> 27:09.360
People told us,
"Don't go there. You'll get shot."

27:10.403 --> 27:11.446
We came.

27:11.988 --> 27:13.364
My husband was killed.

27:15.825 --> 27:19.996
I would like to go and I would like
to take my husband with me.

27:20.914 --> 27:25.251
Why don't you just relax,
have a sip of water?

27:25.251 --> 27:29.130
Maybe you can think of
something that might help us.

27:40.058 --> 27:42.018
You know, I am tired,

27:42.018 --> 27:44.104
and I've already told you
everything I know.

27:44.562 --> 27:46.314
I think we have
everything we need.

27:46.314 --> 27:47.357
Okay.

27:47.732 --> 27:48.983
Thanks for coming.

28:02.872 --> 28:06.167
Cooling the body made it look
like she died earlier than she did.

28:06.584 --> 28:08.461
Electrical company confirms...

28:08.461 --> 28:11.714
there was a spike in kilowatts at that
bungalow from 9:00 P.M. till 12:00.

28:11.714 --> 28:13.341
Okay, but whether he killed her or...

28:13.341 --> 28:14.676
she was just bound and gagged,

28:14.676 --> 28:16.928
our prostitute did not
turn up the air by herself.

28:16.928 --> 28:20.056
Putting somebody else in
the room with her after 9:00 P.M.

28:23.101 --> 28:26.688
So he killed her and then
waited while her body chilled.

28:26.980 --> 28:29.733
New time of death
clears Cole Judson.

28:29.733 --> 28:32.736
Leaving a bitter ex-husband
with time to spare.

28:47.782 --> 28:49.201
Let me ask you a question.

28:50.243 --> 28:52.787
How many things do you think
we'll overlook in a career?

28:52.787 --> 28:53.830
You?

28:54.873 --> 28:56.208
Less than anyone I know.

28:57.000 --> 29:01.671
Me, fewer because of it.
It's a perfect clue.

29:02.130 --> 29:04.716
And Cole is the perfect
guy to pin it on, isn't he?

29:05.217 --> 29:08.220
No alibi, a rap sheet
with a knife assault.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.014
Right, and his wife doesn't
know about the prior conviction,

29:11.014 --> 29:12.599
but her ex-husband does.

29:13.934 --> 29:15.727
That's a lot of information for sale.

29:16.561 --> 29:19.481
Yeah. Let's see if he
purchased any of it, okay?

29:21.358 --> 29:26.238
Castor oil, triglyceride,
heptan-2-one, pigment red 68.

29:27.239 --> 29:29.324
But Greta prefers
a deeper shade of red.

29:31.034 --> 29:34.621
Well, lipstick on the glove
was definitely grandma's.

29:34.621 --> 29:37.165
So the Roeblings were
here for two days...

29:37.165 --> 29:41.127
and somehow a kid from Liberty City
ends up hanging out in their car?

29:41.127 --> 29:43.463
The same kid who
shot the husband.

29:45.048 --> 29:48.969
Okay, so what kind of murder
requires an advance meeting?

29:49.261 --> 29:50.303
A hired hit.

29:51.847 --> 29:53.306
The question is:
Who did the hiring?

29:53.974 --> 29:55.517
Husband ended up dead.

29:56.017 --> 29:59.563
But ... Malcolm was
aiming at the wife.

30:01.648 --> 30:03.233
So he's looking
straight at Greta.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.863
But is Malcolm recognizing his
employer or is he locking on a target?

30:08.363 --> 30:10.824
I don't know.
It's not quantifiable either way.

30:10.824 --> 30:12.909
No, but this is.

30:13.201 --> 30:16.371
The average person's
reaction time from sensation,

30:16.371 --> 30:18.832
perception through response
is one point five seconds.

30:18.832 --> 30:20.041
How do you know that?

30:20.667 --> 30:22.294
Auto insurance studies.

30:22.294 --> 30:26.464
Now, for an unexpected stimulus the
brain needs even more processing time.

30:26.756 --> 30:27.966
Say, for example,

30:27.966 --> 30:30.010
if you weren't accustomed to having
someone pull a gun on you.

30:30.010 --> 30:31.052
Exactly.

30:31.636 --> 30:34.764
The video images are shot at
one-thirtieth of a second intervals.

30:35.515 --> 30:39.186
She ducked in one point one seconds.
Olympians aren't even that fast.

30:41.104 --> 30:43.773
So when do good reflexes
become intent to kill?

30:43.773 --> 30:47.152
And how, within two days
of arriving in Miami...

30:47.152 --> 30:49.988
did the wife find a shooter that
she knew wouldn't flip on her?

30:56.745 --> 30:58.622
A glove ...
a mirror.

30:58.622 --> 31:01.124
And what does any of
this have to do with me?

31:01.333 --> 31:03.960
It has to do with you
and your brother Malcolm.

31:05.212 --> 31:08.673
Did you know that heptan-2-one isn't
approved in the United States?

31:09.591 --> 31:13.553
It offers sun protection.
The sun shines in Germany, doesn't it?

31:14.971 --> 31:17.557
You never asked me
if I lived in Germany.

31:17.974 --> 31:21.102
State department was happy
to provide that information ...

31:23.188 --> 31:24.523
along with your work visa.

31:24.523 --> 31:26.316
It was an easy call.

31:26.316 --> 31:29.861
Once we linked your grandmother's
lipstick to its European manufacturer.

31:31.613 --> 31:33.406
I don't understand.

31:33.406 --> 31:35.033
It's chemistry.

31:35.033 --> 31:38.745
It's a gift, just like all the other cosmetics
you bought for your grandmother.

31:38.745 --> 31:42.415
But those gifts stopped coming once
you were cut from the Stuttgart Ballet.

31:42.666 --> 31:45.085
And then you took on
some private clients.

31:45.877 --> 31:47.212
Like Greta Roebling.

31:47.796 --> 31:50.715
You should have limited your
services to teaching dance.

31:56.680 --> 31:59.015
Wife's ready to make a deal.

31:59.015 --> 32:02.894
She's very opposed to the death penalty
especially when it's applied to her.

32:03.270 --> 32:06.481
I don't like to exercise,
not even dance.

32:07.148 --> 32:09.234
I complain and complain.
It's my way.

32:10.193 --> 32:13.196
So, when I told Brian:
"I wish my husband were dead".

32:13.822 --> 32:15.907
I didn't mean it literally.

32:16.741 --> 32:19.369
And then Brian said he'd
arranged a shooting person.

32:19.911 --> 32:24.040
I said, "Where I come from,
ten grand buys you a corpse."

32:24.040 --> 32:27.961
I was talking trash.
She gives me an itinerary.

32:27.961 --> 32:31.172
They're coming here.
Hands me cash for a ticket, too.

32:31.172 --> 32:35.218
She booked you but at any point,
you could have said no.

32:35.218 --> 32:36.344
I was broke.

32:37.637 --> 32:39.848
And I had leaned on
every friend that I had.

32:40.849 --> 32:44.186
And I swore that I would
never end up where I came from.

32:44.728 --> 32:47.939
So you came home to cash out
on your little brother's back.

32:53.111 --> 32:54.112
Malcolm ...

32:55.780 --> 32:58.909
he saw what I had and
he wanted out, too.

33:01.203 --> 33:02.662
But he didn't have a focus.

33:04.331 --> 33:07.083
'Cause he had never
worked for anything before.

33:08.126 --> 33:10.545
I said, "Get a fresh strap."

33:10.545 --> 33:13.340
But does he do it? No.

33:15.425 --> 33:18.970
A different gun.
That's looking out for him.

33:26.269 --> 33:28.813
I started with the biggest
criminal records company.

33:28.813 --> 33:30.899
All you need is a social
and a date of birth.

33:30.899 --> 33:33.568
Thirty bucks buys you a
lot of information these days.

33:33.568 --> 33:35.403
That one's out of Jacksonville.

33:35.403 --> 33:38.031
There's no billing to the ex,
Michael Giotti,

33:38.031 --> 33:39.783
but they did run Cole's
criminal history.

33:39.783 --> 33:43.954
This one's bought and paid for by
Cole's landlord, Lee Bastille.

33:44.246 --> 33:47.207
Checking a tenant's history
is not exactly a crime.

33:47.749 --> 33:50.418
Unless you use it
to frame them for murder.

33:51.044 --> 33:53.964
Mrs. Bastille, how long have you
and your husband owned the building?

33:53.964 --> 33:55.382
Uh, three ...

33:55.382 --> 33:56.758
no, four years.

33:56.758 --> 33:58.844
But I don't know
Mr. Judson very well.

33:59.344 --> 34:01.513
Don't you check into
your tenant's histories?

34:01.513 --> 34:03.557
Uh, only a credit check.

34:03.557 --> 34:08.353
Sometimes Lee will have me call a
reference -- previous landlords.

34:08.812 --> 34:10.856
Do you manage the
building with your husband?

34:11.481 --> 34:15.402
We do pretty much everything
together. Or at least I try.

34:16.235 --> 34:18.321
It sometimes drives
Lee crazy but...

34:18.321 --> 34:19.906
you have to hold
a marriage together.

34:20.239 --> 34:21.908
I understand that Mr. Judson...

34:21.908 --> 34:23.994
did some work for your
husband around the building.

34:24.327 --> 34:26.955
That's why Lee would be able
to tell you more about him.

34:26.955 --> 34:29.791
He just left, but I could
reach him on his cell phone.

34:29.791 --> 34:31.543
That won't be necessary.
You have a ...

34:32.918 --> 34:34.462
a forensics buff in the house.

34:34.462 --> 34:37.174
They're Lee's.
He can't get enough.

34:37.174 --> 34:38.300
I think they're disgusting.

34:40.010 --> 34:41.052
No ... no offense.

34:41.052 --> 34:44.639
No. None taken.
Could I, um ...

34:44.639 --> 34:45.891
could I use your bathroom?

35:05.452 --> 35:06.828
Why are you wearing gloves?

35:06.828 --> 35:11.082
This is cardamom soap,
Mrs. Bastille. Is this yours?

35:11.082 --> 35:14.711
No. Lee brought it home.

35:16.421 --> 35:17.839
Did he do that recently?

35:18.673 --> 35:20.091
A few nights ago.

35:20.509 --> 35:21.843
Possibly Wednesday?

35:25.722 --> 35:28.058
Did he ask you to use this,
Mrs. Bastille?

35:30.852 --> 35:32.229
He didn't ask.

35:38.276 --> 35:39.236
How do you mean?

35:40.278 --> 35:41.321
Well ...

35:41.988 --> 35:46.076
we've been married
almost nine years, and ...

35:47.160 --> 35:49.454
I'd accused Lee of being
asleep for eight of them.

35:50.956 --> 35:53.458
Then one day he woke up.

35:55.252 --> 35:57.671
It  wasn't how
I thought it would be.

35:58.505 --> 36:00.215
Is that when
the baths started?

36:01.049 --> 36:03.844
And every day since.

36:04.761 --> 36:05.804
Be still.

36:10.725 --> 36:11.768
That's better.

36:27.576 --> 36:30.287
Okay, Mrs. Bastille,
I'm going to level with you.

36:30.287 --> 36:32.414
The woman that we found that
was stabbed to death...

36:32.414 --> 36:34.708
was bathed in
cardamom soap by the killer.

36:34.708 --> 36:37.002
I need to know where
he was Wednesday night.

36:39.045 --> 36:42.924
He was home.
We always eat at seven.

36:43.717 --> 36:47.679
Later he said he got a call
from a tenant -- some broken pipes.

36:48.013 --> 36:49.639
Okay, what time was that?

36:50.265 --> 36:51.808
Uh, a little before nine.

36:56.229 --> 36:59.024
I ... didn't hear
the phone ring.

37:01.109 --> 37:04.070
He'll be home
any minute.

37:04.070 --> 37:06.323
Okay, I don't want you
to worry about that right now.

37:06.323 --> 37:08.325
Here's what I want to do:
I want to search your apartment,

37:08.325 --> 37:11.077
but first I want to get you out of
here for your personal safety.

37:11.077 --> 37:12.120
Can I do that?

37:55.288 --> 37:56.581
I didn't do anything.

37:56.581 --> 37:59.709
Now, the Judsons were in
your building less than a month...

37:59.709 --> 38:02.629
before you created the
plumbing emergency, right?

38:03.004 --> 38:05.173
That both Wendy and
Cole Judson confirm...

38:05.173 --> 38:08.176
you insisted on
fixing with Cole's help.

38:23.483 --> 38:26.611
We found traces of epoxy
in the plumber's putty.

38:40.375 --> 38:42.460
Nice job on the print,
by the way.

38:45.672 --> 38:47.924
This is from a botanist.

38:47.924 --> 38:48.925
That's correct.

38:48.925 --> 38:53.513
You transferred mold from your bathroom
to the bedspread of the bungalow.

38:53.513 --> 38:55.182
I don't understand ...

38:56.016 --> 38:58.935
Check your crime books,
my friend. Mold has DNA.

39:01.563 --> 39:05.567
I was at home with
my wife having dinner.

39:05.567 --> 39:07.652
Ask her. We do the
same thing every night.

39:08.737 --> 39:11.239
I mean, we may not look
at each other or talk for days,

39:11.239 --> 39:14.576
but we eat together,
seven o'clock.

39:14.576 --> 39:19.456
While Susan McCreary lay bound,
gagged terrified, but not dead, right?

39:34.054 --> 39:35.388
You left her waiting...

39:35.388 --> 39:39.017
while you went home
to your wife to set up an alibi.

39:39.893 --> 39:42.354
Later, after you killed her...

39:42.354 --> 39:46.316
you dropped her body temperature
so you could roll the clock back.

39:53.156 --> 39:54.866
You would
have pulled this off...

39:54.866 --> 39:57.702
without the bloody print had
you not gone too far.

40:03.708 --> 40:04.751
I liked it.

40:21.893 --> 40:23.603
I can see that...

40:23.603 --> 40:27.023
evidenced by the bar of soap
that you took home as a souvenir.

40:27.941 --> 40:30.235
Wh ... ?

40:30.235 --> 40:33.113
You never take soap
from hotel rooms?

40:33.113 --> 40:34.823
It's not a crime
if you paid for it.

40:35.490 --> 40:38.201
The same doesn't apply to the
women you kill though, right?

40:42.038 --> 40:43.498
Think about it.

40:44.916 --> 40:45.959
What do we do?

40:47.043 --> 40:51.423
Work, sleep,
eat the same food,

40:51.756 --> 40:55.385
have the same sex and
then do it all over again tomorrow.

40:57.888 --> 41:03.518
I felt dead until I felt her
life slip through my hands.

41:07.564 --> 41:11.735
I was curious.
I'm not a monster.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.073
To her, you were.
