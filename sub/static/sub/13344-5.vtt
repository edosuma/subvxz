WEBVTT

00:05.806 --> 00:08.376
Male voice:
PREVIOUSLY ON
"IN TREATMENT"...

00:08.476 --> 00:11.512
I LOVE YOU. I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST AN INFATUATION,

00:11.612 --> 00:13.081
BUT IT'S GETTING WORSE.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.682
YOU'VE BECOME
THE CENTER OF MY LIFE.

00:14.782 --> 00:18.786
LAURA,
I'M YOUR THERAPIST.
I'M NOT AN OPTION.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.955
I DIDN'T COME HERE FOR THERAPY.
I JUST NEED YOU TO WRITE
YOUR OPINION

00:22.056 --> 00:24.158
AND TELL ME THAT I'M
PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT

00:24.258 --> 00:26.026
AND TELL THEM
THAT I'M NOT SOME PERSON

00:26.127 --> 00:27.528
THAT FLIES
INTO CARS EVERY DAY.

00:27.628 --> 00:29.563
IS THAT WHY YOU CAME
HERE TODAY, SOPHIE,

00:29.663 --> 00:32.300
FOR ME TO TELL YOU
THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.668
IS THAT THE TEST
YOU'RE AFRAID OF FAILING?

00:34.768 --> 00:37.538
- I AM GOING BACK THERE.
- TO THE SITE WHERE YOU
DROPPED THE BOMB?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.673
TO THE PLACE
WHERE THE CHILDREN
WERE KILLED?

00:39.773 --> 00:42.143
DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S
A STRONG DESIRE THERE

00:42.243 --> 00:44.778
TO ATONE FOR YOUR ACTIONS?

00:46.914 --> 00:49.517
YES TO THE PREGNANCY OR NO?
TO HAVE AN ABORTION
OR NOT HAVE IT?

00:49.617 --> 00:51.785
JUST FUCKING SAY IT ALREADY.
TELL US WHAT YOU THINK.

00:51.885 --> 00:55.189
- I THINK YOU SHOULD
HAVE AN ABORTION.
- REALLY?

00:55.289 --> 00:57.958
Hello, you've reached
the office of Dr. Gina Toll.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.828
Please leave me a message.
( beeps )

01:00.928 --> 01:02.730
GINA, IT'S PAUL.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.732
PAUL WESTIN.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.186
( knocks )

01:30.824 --> 01:34.762
- HELLO, GINA.
- HELLO, PAUL.

01:38.999 --> 01:40.634
( sighs )

01:41.602 --> 01:44.505
I, UM...

01:44.605 --> 01:46.540
I COULDN'T REMEMBER
WHICH ENTRANCE TO USE.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.109
I WAS PARKING THE CAR
AND I THOUGHT,

01:49.210 --> 01:50.978
"IS IT THE FRONT
ENTRANCE OR THE--"

01:51.078 --> 01:52.346
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
IN A WHILE.

01:52.446 --> 01:55.416
- SURE.
- COME IN.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.785
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
TO DRINK? COFFEE?

01:57.885 --> 02:00.221
NO. NO NO,
I'M FINE ACTUALLY.

02:06.026 --> 02:07.695
THAT'S WHERE I SIT.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.832
YES, OF COURSE.

02:25.078 --> 02:28.449
( theme music playing )

02:45.098 --> 02:47.235
( chuckles )

02:50.604 --> 02:54.041
- YOU LOOK VERY WELL, GINA.
- THANK YOU.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.311
IT'S NOT TRUE
BUT IT'S NICE TO HEAR.

02:57.411 --> 03:00.214
THE HARDEST PART
ABOUT TURNING 60

03:00.314 --> 03:02.350
IS THAT, IN MY MIND,

03:02.450 --> 03:04.418
I'M STILL AS ENERGETIC
AS A 30-YEAR-OLD.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.788
FOR SIX HOURS,
I HAVE ALL THE ENERGY
OF A 30-YEAR-OLD.

03:07.888 --> 03:09.423
THE REST OF THE DAY,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.359
I'M AN OLD,
TIRED WOMAN.

03:11.459 --> 03:13.026
OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.

03:13.126 --> 03:14.495
WOULD YOU LIKE
A PIECE OF CAKE?

03:14.595 --> 03:16.397
IT'S SUGAR-FREE THOUGH.
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.066
DON'T GET ME STARTED.
I CAN'T EAT ANYTHING

03:19.166 --> 03:20.634
THAT I LIKE
THESE DAYS.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.670
CHOLESTEROL.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.675
YOU KNOW, IT'S, UM...

03:29.243 --> 03:31.812
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY
BEING HERE AGAIN.

03:31.912 --> 03:33.381
WELL, I'M RETIRED NOW

03:33.481 --> 03:35.148
SO I TURNED THIS ROOM
INTO A STUDY.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.217
YEAH, SO I SEE.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.253
IT'S WHERE I DO
MY WRITING.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.088
OH, YOU'RE WRITING.

03:41.188 --> 03:44.091
BUT WHAT?

03:44.191 --> 03:46.159
I DON'T KNOW.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.929
MAYBE AN ARTICLE
OR SOMETHING LESS FORMAL.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.098
MAYBE SOMETHING LONGER.

03:51.198 --> 03:53.567
I DON'T KNOW.

03:55.102 --> 03:57.004
IT'S STRANGE...

03:57.104 --> 03:59.072
BEING HERE

03:59.172 --> 04:01.409
AFTER DAVID.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.444
HOW ARE YOU
COPING WITH THAT?

04:03.544 --> 04:06.213
IT WAS PROBABLY THE MOST
DIFFICULT TIME OF MY LIFE,

04:06.314 --> 04:09.450
COMING BACK HOME
WITHOUT HIM.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.920
HE WAS A REMARKABLE MAN.

04:14.221 --> 04:16.924
YES, HE WAS.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.129
HOW ABOUT YOU?

04:22.229 --> 04:24.164
OH, ME.
( chuckles )

04:24.264 --> 04:26.834
WELL, I'M, UM...

04:26.934 --> 04:28.536
I'M WORKING TOO HARD.

04:28.636 --> 04:31.739
I'M TRYING TO LOSE
THIS WEIGHT. I CAN'T.

04:31.839 --> 04:33.874
UM...

04:33.974 --> 04:36.577
I FEEL LIKE I'M HAVING
ANOTHER MIDLIFE CRISIS.

04:36.677 --> 04:39.480
HAD ONE AT 30,
ANOTHER ONE AT 40

04:39.580 --> 04:41.682
AND NOW I'M HAVING
MY THIRD ONE AT 50.

04:41.782 --> 04:44.518
- HOW'S KATE?
- KATE'S GOOD. SHE'S FINE.

04:44.618 --> 04:47.287
- AND THE KIDS?
- THE KIDS, WELL...

04:47.388 --> 04:50.290
IAN'S GONE TO COLLEGE.
HE'S AT WESLEYAN.

04:50.391 --> 04:52.660
ROSIE, WELL,
SHE'S BUSY BEING ROSIE.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.463
ROSIE. HOW OLD
IS SHE NOW?

04:55.563 --> 04:59.032
17. SHE'S STILL
EXACTLY THE SAME.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.969
SHE'S STILL GOT
THE WORLD WRAPPED AROUND
HER LITTLE FINGER.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.604
17.

05:03.704 --> 05:06.974
AND, OF COURSE, MAX.
MAX IS NINE.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.309
MAX?

05:09.410 --> 05:12.380
KATE GOT PREGNANT
AFTER WE'D LAST
SEEN EACH OTHER.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.816
AND SO WE HAD MAX--

05:15.916 --> 05:17.351
EVERYBODY'S FAVORITE,

05:17.451 --> 05:20.688
LIKE JOSEPH
AND HIS BROTHERS.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.724
SO HE'S EXACTLY
THE AGE ROSIE WAS
WHEN YOU--

05:23.824 --> 05:26.827
YES, WHEN I STOPPED
COMING HERE, YEAH.

05:35.969 --> 05:38.572
( coughs )
GINA, I...

05:38.672 --> 05:40.674
I CALLED YOU
LAST NIGHT BECAUSE, UM...

05:40.774 --> 05:44.412
I REALLY FELT THAT I NEEDED
TO TALK TO SOMEBODY.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.180
IT'S, UM...

05:47.280 --> 05:49.249
ACTUALLY, IT'S SOMETHING
THAT'S BEEN

05:49.349 --> 05:52.486
BOTHERING ME
A LOT LATELY

05:52.586 --> 05:55.823
BUT ONLY YESTERDAY I REALLY
FELT THE NEED THAT I HAD TO...

05:55.923 --> 05:57.758
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

05:57.858 --> 05:59.993
I FEEL THAT...

06:00.093 --> 06:03.230
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PUT THIS
BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M...

06:03.330 --> 06:05.332
I'M JUST LOSING

06:05.433 --> 06:08.469
MY PATIENCE.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.505
I'M LOSING MY PATIENCE
WITH MY PATIENTS.

06:13.641 --> 06:17.044
THERE ARE SESSIONS WHEN I CAN
BARELY RESTRAIN MYSELF

06:17.144 --> 06:18.378
FROM HAVING JUST...

06:18.479 --> 06:20.180
FROM AN OUTBURST.

06:20.280 --> 06:21.949
I WANT TO JUST LOCK
THE DOOR SOME DAYS

06:22.049 --> 06:25.786
AND WISH EVERYBODY
WOULD JUST GO AWAY.

06:29.222 --> 06:31.358
I HAVE THIS...
I HAVE THIS COUPLE

06:31.459 --> 06:34.027
WHO'VE BEEN COMING TO ME
FOR MARRIAGE COUNSELING.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.596
THEY HAVE ONE CHILD

06:35.696 --> 06:38.398
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN
TRYING FOR FIVE YEARS

06:38.499 --> 06:40.067
TO HAVE ANOTHER BABY.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.536
SO SHE GETS PREGNANT

06:42.636 --> 06:44.404
AND NOW SHE WANTS
TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.307
I THINK WHAT
SHE REALLY WANTS

06:47.407 --> 06:49.409
IS TO GET RID OF THE HUSBAND
IF YOU ASK ME.

06:49.510 --> 06:53.280
BUT ANYWAY, THIS GUY...

06:53.380 --> 06:55.716
REALLY GOT
ON MY NERVES YESTERDAY.

06:55.816 --> 06:59.119
HE CORNERED ME.
HE BADGERED ME

06:59.219 --> 07:00.788
UNTIL I MADE A DECISION.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.690
SHOULD WE HAVE AN ABORTION?
SHOULD WE NOT HAVE AN ABORTION?

07:02.790 --> 07:04.291
I FINALLY SAID,
"YES, GOOD,

07:04.391 --> 07:05.993
HAVE AN ABORTION."

07:06.093 --> 07:09.597
AS SOON AS I SAID IT
OF COURSE I REGRETTED IT
BECAUSE I KNEW

07:09.697 --> 07:11.665
THAT I HAD SPOKEN
IN ANGER BUT I...

07:11.765 --> 07:14.535
I COULDN'T HELP IT.
THIS GUY, HE JUST...

07:14.635 --> 07:16.904
HE SAID SOME REALLY
NASTY THINGS TO ME.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.873
HE--

07:21.208 --> 07:22.910
HE CALLED ME...

07:23.911 --> 07:25.913
A MURDERER.
I KNEW HE WAS RIGHT

07:26.013 --> 07:28.482
THE SECOND IT
CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH.
OF COURSE HE WAS RIGHT.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.118
I WAS SITTING THERE
TELLING HIM

07:31.218 --> 07:33.721
TO KILL HIS BABY.

07:35.255 --> 07:36.857
BUT STILL, I WAS...

07:38.626 --> 07:40.393
I KNOW I'M NOT
MAKING MUCH SENSE BUT--

07:40.494 --> 07:42.162
ANYWAY.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.633
AND THERE'S THIS GIRL

07:45.733 --> 07:47.434
WHO I'VE BEEN WORKING
WITH FOR A YEAR.

07:47.535 --> 07:51.004
THERE'S AN ISSUE
OF EROTIC TRANSFERENCE

07:51.104 --> 07:53.741
AND THIS CAME OUT NOW.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.677
EVERYTHING IS ALL ABOUT
THIS ISSUE

07:56.777 --> 07:58.211
AND I'M THINKING TO MYSELF,

07:58.311 --> 08:00.013
"WHAT..."

08:01.248 --> 08:03.984
IF PATIENTS COULD SEE
WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEM,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.053
IF THEY COULD REALLY
SEE INSIDE MY HEAD,

08:06.153 --> 08:09.156
THEY'D HEAD FOR THE HILLS,
BELIEVE ME.

08:09.256 --> 08:10.691
THEY'D RUN FOR COVER.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.360
WHAT ABOUT NEW PATIENTS?
ARE YOU TAKING ON NEW PATIENTS?

08:13.460 --> 08:14.862
YES, I AM.

08:14.962 --> 08:17.230
I THINK I TAKE THEM ON
TO PROVE TO MYSELF

08:17.330 --> 08:20.000
THAT EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

08:21.168 --> 08:24.137
I'VE TAKEN ON THIS GUY,

08:24.237 --> 08:26.173
HE'S A BOMBER PILOT.

08:26.273 --> 08:28.075
COCKY,

08:28.175 --> 08:31.144
ARROGANT KIND OF A GUY.
MACHO, YOU KNOW?

08:31.244 --> 08:32.613
FLEW A MISSION OVER IRAQ,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.815
DROPPED A BOMB

08:34.915 --> 08:36.383
ON A SCHOOL

08:36.483 --> 08:38.952
WHERE 16 CHILDREN
WERE KILLED.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.855
SO HE COMES BACK,
HE GOES ON LEAVE

08:41.955 --> 08:44.925
AND THEN HE
RUNS FOR 22 MILES
WITHOUT STOPPING

08:45.025 --> 08:47.761
AND BRINGS
A HEART ATTACK
ON TO HIMSELF.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.863
SO I'M TRYING TO GET
THIS GUY TO SEE

08:49.963 --> 08:51.865
THAT MAYBE THERE'S
A CONNECTION

08:51.965 --> 08:54.768
BETWEEN THESE
TWO EVENTS BUT...

08:55.569 --> 08:57.170
ANYWAY,

08:57.270 --> 08:58.505
ALL THE TIME
I LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

08:58.606 --> 09:00.608
AS IF IT'S NOTHING.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.976
BUT INSIDE, I'M JUST...

09:05.312 --> 09:06.513
I JUST FIND IT SO...

09:06.614 --> 09:09.549
SO DISGUSTING.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.652
AND THERE'S A GIRL

09:11.752 --> 09:14.554
WHO GOES TO ROSIE'S
SCHOOL WHO--

09:14.655 --> 09:16.590
YOU'RE TREATING A FRIEND
OF YOUR DAUGHTER'S?

09:16.690 --> 09:18.425
NO, SHE'S NOT A FRIEND.

09:18.525 --> 09:20.127
THEY'RE JUST
IN THE SAME GRADE.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.262
ANYWAY, THIS GIRL...

09:22.362 --> 09:25.132
IDOLIZES HER COACH.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.039
WERE YOU INSULTED?

09:32.139 --> 09:33.741
ABOUT WHAT?

09:33.841 --> 09:36.744
THAT THE PATIENT
CALLED YOU A MURDERER?

09:37.577 --> 09:39.813
YES, I WAS.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.851
GINA, I KNOW
I'M A GOOD THERAPIST.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.486
AND-- I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THIS WEEK

09:46.586 --> 09:49.189
I NEED SOMEBODY
TO JUST TELL ME
TO CALM DOWN,

09:49.289 --> 09:51.191
TELL ME THAT
EVERYTHING'S OKAY,

09:51.291 --> 09:54.127
THAT EVERYTHING'S
ALL RIGHT.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.764
I REMEMBER YOU SAID ONCE
THAT ONE OF OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS

09:56.864 --> 09:58.565
WAS THAT WE DON'T
HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.600
WE DON'T HAVE ANYBODY
TO PAT US ON THE BACK,

10:00.701 --> 10:02.569
TO APPROVE OF WHAT
WE'RE DOING.

10:02.670 --> 10:05.172
SOMEBODY THAT YOU CAN
GO TO AND SAY,

10:05.272 --> 10:08.341
"DID YOU SEE HOW I MANEUVERED
THAT PERSON INTO THAT SITUATION?

10:08.441 --> 10:11.745
DID YOU SEE HOW I GOT HIM
TO SAY WHAT I WANTED HIM TO?"

10:11.845 --> 10:14.481
WHAT I MEANT WAS,
IS THAT WE HAVE NO ONE

10:14.581 --> 10:17.284
TO CRITICIZE US,
NO ONE TO REVIEW US.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.421
MMM.

10:21.521 --> 10:24.892
ANYWAY, I...

10:24.992 --> 10:28.161
I'M BEGINNING TO FEEL ANXIOUS
BEFORE SESSIONS AND I...

10:37.504 --> 10:38.739
I MUST ADMIT THAT I THOUGHT

10:38.839 --> 10:41.208
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON
AT HOME WHEN YOU CALLED.

10:41.308 --> 10:43.977
AT HOME? WHY?

10:44.077 --> 10:47.748
WELL, BECAUSE IT'S BEEN
ALMOST 10 YEARS

10:47.848 --> 10:50.617
SINCE I LAST
HEARD FROM YOU.

10:50.718 --> 10:53.520
THE LAST TIME YOU WERE HERE,
YOU WERE SO ANGRY.

10:53.620 --> 10:57.490
YOU DIDN'T EVEN COME
TO THE FUNERAL.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.994
I THOUGHT, "HOW ANGRY
HE MUST BE.

11:01.094 --> 11:04.164
HE DIDN'T EVEN COME
TO DAVID'S FUNERAL."

11:07.667 --> 11:09.970
AND I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THAT, GINA.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.775
I HAD...

11:16.609 --> 11:18.846
I WAS GONNA COME BUT
I FELT THAT IT WAS...

11:20.748 --> 11:22.916
I FELT IT WAS
INAPPROPRIATE.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.652
THEN YOU CALL ME
OUT OF THE BLUE.

11:25.753 --> 11:28.956
YES, BECAUSE I NEEDED
SOMEBODY TO TALK TO.

11:29.056 --> 11:32.926
YOU WERE THE ONE WHO CHOSE
TO STOP HAVING A SUPERVISOR.

11:34.627 --> 11:37.564
YOU SAID I INTERFERED
WITH YOUR PRACTICE,

11:37.664 --> 11:40.433
THAT INSTEAD OF GUIDING
I WAS INTERFERING.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.169
YES, I SAID THAT.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.837
BUT THEN THERE ARE TIMES

11:43.937 --> 11:45.705
WHEN A SUPERVISOR
HAS TO TAKE A STAND.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.508
IN YOUR CASE I FELT
I HAD TO TAKE A STAND.

11:48.608 --> 11:50.143
I HAD TO INTERFERE.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.045
BUT THAT'S NOT
THE WAY I FEEL NOW.

11:52.145 --> 11:54.381
I MEAN, THAT'S
ANCIENT HISTORY.

11:54.481 --> 11:56.316
WHY DO WE HAVE TO GO THERE?

11:57.550 --> 11:59.186
ANYWAY, WHATEVER HAPPENED,

11:59.286 --> 12:01.621
I ALWAYS FELT THAT

12:01.721 --> 12:05.658
YOU WERE SOMEBODY
PROFESSIONALLY I COULD--

12:05.759 --> 12:08.495
I COULD AT LEAST TALK TO.

12:09.696 --> 12:13.400
ME? I'M ALREADY RETIRED.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.335
OH, I FORGOT, YES.

12:16.369 --> 12:17.838
YOU'RE WRITING YOUR MEMOIRS.

12:17.938 --> 12:20.507
( laughs )
NO. NO NO NO.

12:20.607 --> 12:22.542
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT YOU MEANT

12:22.642 --> 12:25.012
WHEN YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE WRITING.

12:25.112 --> 12:28.381
- WHY, ARE YOU AFRAID
I'LL WRITE ABOUT YOU?
- OH!

12:28.481 --> 12:31.718
I THINK THERE'S WAY TOO MANY
AUTOBIOGRAPHIES ANYWAY.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.454
WHO CARES?

12:34.554 --> 12:36.023
MAYBE SOMEBODY
LIKE BOB DYLAN,

12:36.123 --> 12:37.791
I'D BE CURIOUS
ABOUT THAT.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.460
BUT HOW MANY PEOPLE
LIKE HIM ARE OUT THERE?

12:42.462 --> 12:44.097
I'M TRYING TO WRITE A NOVEL.

12:44.197 --> 12:46.066
OH YEAH? WOW.

12:46.166 --> 12:47.367
( laughs )

12:47.467 --> 12:48.836
WOW, THAT'S--

12:48.936 --> 12:50.270
I DON'T KNOW, WE'LL SEE.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.672
I'VE GIVEN MYSELF
A YEAR TO WRITE.

12:52.772 --> 12:55.408
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
TO SAY ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.477
I DON'T KNOW.

13:04.952 --> 13:07.888
KATE AND I, WE...

13:07.988 --> 13:10.991
WE JUST ARGUE NONSTOP.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.426
I THINK IT'S BEGINNING
TO AFFECT MY WORK.

13:13.526 --> 13:15.162
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU ARGUE?

13:15.262 --> 13:18.365
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT
SOMETHING INSIGNIFICANT,

13:18.465 --> 13:21.001
SOMETHING TRIVIAL
THAT TRIGGERS IT OFF.

13:21.101 --> 13:23.203
THIS TIME
IT WAS ABOUT MAX

13:23.303 --> 13:26.673
AND BEING ASKED TO GO
TO THESE CLASSES

13:26.773 --> 13:28.808
FOR GIFTED
CHILDREN,

13:28.909 --> 13:31.178
- WHICH I JUST--
- IS MAX GIFTED?

13:31.278 --> 13:33.313
HE'S VERY
VERY SMART, YEAH.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.049
WELL THEN, WHAT DO
YOU FIGHT ABOUT?

13:36.149 --> 13:37.851
SHE--

13:37.951 --> 13:39.719
SHE KNOWS HOW
I FEEL ABOUT THIS.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.923
I HAVE SAID IT
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.257
I AM AGAINST
THE IDEA OF IT.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.226
WHAT DOES SHE DO?
BEHIND MY BACK,

13:46.326 --> 13:49.596
SHE TAKES MAX
TO THIS-- TO THIS CLASS
WITHOUT TELLING ME.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.398
AND, YOU KNOW,
THEY DECIDE THAT--

13:51.498 --> 13:55.268
- WHO ARE THEY?
- THIS PRINCIPAL AND--
AND KATE.

13:55.368 --> 13:57.737
THIS GIRL-- SHE'S BARELY
OUT OF COLLEGE,

13:57.837 --> 13:59.839
SHE BARELY KNOWS
MY SON'S NAME--

13:59.940 --> 14:01.674
PONTIFICATING,
TELLING ME

14:01.774 --> 14:03.743
HOW I SHOULD RAISE MY KID.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.880
AND KATE AND I
START TO ARGUE

14:06.980 --> 14:09.883
ABOUT THAT AND THEN
THAT LEADS ONTO OTHER STUFF

14:09.983 --> 14:11.985
AND THEN WE END UP
AND IT'S LIKE,

14:12.085 --> 14:13.987
"OH, YOU CARE SO MUCH
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.788
IF YOU CARED AS MUCH
ABOUT YOUR FAMILY

14:15.889 --> 14:18.491
AS YOU CARED
ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS,
THEN IT WOULD--"

14:18.591 --> 14:20.693
- KATE SAID THAT?
- YES.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.896
YES.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.498
SHE SAYS I DON'T LOVE HER...

14:26.934 --> 14:29.636
THAT I'M ALWAYS TRYING
TO BE A STEP AHEAD OF HER,

14:29.736 --> 14:32.772
THAT I HANDLE HER
LIKE A PATIENT.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.608
SHE SAYS THE THING
THAT SHE HATES THE MOST

14:35.708 --> 14:38.578
IS THAT I SEE IT ALL
FROM A DISTANCE.

14:38.678 --> 14:39.879
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "IT"?

14:39.980 --> 14:42.182
HER, US, IT.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.985
SHE SAYS THAT
WHEN IT COMES TO US,

14:45.085 --> 14:47.154
I'LL NEVER HAVE
ANY PERSPECTIVE.

14:47.254 --> 14:48.621
SHE'S RIGHT, ISN'T SHE?

14:48.721 --> 14:51.691
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT SEE IT
FROM A PERSPECTIVE.

14:51.791 --> 14:53.893
AND ALL I CAN SEE IS...

14:55.028 --> 14:57.130
( sighs )
ALL I CAN SEE IS RUPTURE.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.966
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"RUPTURE"?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.338
ARE YOU TRYING
TO SHRINK ME, GINA?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.674
( laughs )

15:10.910 --> 15:13.280
SORRY.

15:13.380 --> 15:15.482
AND YET YOU WERE HERE
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

15:15.582 --> 15:16.916
YES, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

15:17.017 --> 15:18.885
YOU WERE UNDER
MY COUNSELING.

15:18.986 --> 15:21.721
EIGHT YEARS,
I TOOK CARE OF YOU.

15:21.821 --> 15:24.324
YOU FIND THAT
DIFFICULT TO ACCEPT?

15:25.558 --> 15:29.662
I WAS YOUR AUDIENCE
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.899
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD YOU
ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT...

15:33.000 --> 15:35.168
ABOUT KATE.

15:36.303 --> 15:38.405
MAYBE IT'S JUST
BECAUSE I'M EXHAUSTED.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.407
I AM WIPED OUT.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.377
AND I'M JUST AFRAID THAT
BECAUSE OF THAT,

15:44.477 --> 15:48.581
SOMETHING THAT WILL HAPPEN,
THAT I'LL LOSE CONTROL.

15:51.384 --> 15:54.521
ANYWAY, WE DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT KATE--

15:54.621 --> 15:56.723
THOUGH, OF COURSE,
JUST BEFORE I CAME HERE

15:56.823 --> 15:58.458
WE HAD A BIG FIGHT
ON THE PHONE.

15:58.558 --> 16:01.161
YOU KEEP SAYING YOU DIDN'T
COME HERE TO TALK ABOUT KATE

16:01.261 --> 16:02.529
BUT YOU KEEP
TALKING ABOUT HER.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.631
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU MAKE ME
TALK ABOUT HER.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.733
I'M NOT DOING ANYTHING.
IT'S BEEN EIGHT YEARS

16:06.833 --> 16:09.536
- AND I'M TRYING TO CATCH UP.
- COME ON, GINA, I'M NOT STUPID.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.771
THERE'S ALWAYS A REASON
WITH YOU, SO DON'T--

16:11.871 --> 16:14.607
DON'T TELL ME WE'RE HAVING
A NICE COZY CONVERSATION HERE

16:14.707 --> 16:16.709
ABOUT MY MARRIED LIFE.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.414
( sighs )

16:21.514 --> 16:23.150
WELL...

16:24.117 --> 16:25.985
WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.022
WE COULD GET TOGETHER
A COUPLE OF TIMES

16:29.122 --> 16:30.590
AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.127
OKAY.

16:35.128 --> 16:36.929
IS THIS TIME
GOOD FOR YOU?

16:37.030 --> 16:39.332
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.003
MAY I SAY SOMETHING
BEFORE WE GO ON?

16:44.104 --> 16:46.306
WHAT ABOUT? KATE?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.775
THERE'S A SADNESS
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT HER--

16:48.875 --> 16:50.477
IN YOUR VOICE.

16:50.577 --> 16:53.280
THERE'S SOMETHING
VERY SAD ABOUT IT.

17:08.295 --> 17:10.597
I DON'T KNOW WHERE SHE IS
MOST OF THE TIME.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.204
SHE TELLS ME THAT SHE'S
GOING TO THE GYM AND I...

17:19.239 --> 17:21.208
I LOOK IN HER CLOSET AND...

17:22.175 --> 17:25.478
HER GEAR IS STILL THERE.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.047
AND I SAY TO MYSELF,
"OH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S...

17:28.148 --> 17:29.816
SHE'S PROBABLY GOT ANOTHER

17:29.916 --> 17:32.485
SET OF RUNNING SHOES."

17:34.020 --> 17:37.757
WHEN I CALL HER CELL,

17:37.857 --> 17:39.759
SHE NEVER ANSWERS.

17:42.695 --> 17:44.297
I LET IT GO.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.633
USUALLY IN THE EVENING,
WE'RE TOO TIRED

17:46.733 --> 17:50.237
AND SO A WEEK LATER
I'LL SUDDENLY SAY,

17:50.337 --> 17:53.573
"WHERE WERE YOU
LAST WEDNESDAY?"

17:55.007 --> 17:56.576
AND SHE'LL LOOK AT ME
LIKE I'M--

17:56.676 --> 17:58.578
I'M CRAZY.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.182
AND THEN...

18:04.351 --> 18:06.953
SEX.
( exhales )

18:07.053 --> 18:09.889
SEX IS OUT
OF THE QUESTION.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.725
ONCE A MONTH
IF I'M LUCKY.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.827
SHE HARDLY EVER...

18:16.896 --> 18:19.266
INITIATES IT.

18:21.668 --> 18:24.971
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME SHE WANTED IT.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.873
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

18:26.973 --> 18:28.475
DO YOU WANT TO?

18:28.575 --> 18:31.778
I THINK ABOUT IT
ALL THE TIME.

18:35.715 --> 18:39.051
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
IF SOMEBODY CAME TO YOU

18:39.152 --> 18:41.020
WITH A STORY LIKE MINE?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.489
I DON'T KNOW.

18:42.589 --> 18:45.024
WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT YOU AND KATE.

18:45.124 --> 18:47.394
WE'RE NOT SPECULATING
ABOUT A PATIENT.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.166
DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY
THAT SHE'S HAVING AN AFFAIR?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.537
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE IS,

18:57.637 --> 19:00.273
BECAUSE OF HER
RUNNING SHOES?

19:00.373 --> 19:03.243
I ALWAYS ASK MYSELF,

19:03.343 --> 19:06.112
"IF THEY WERE
TO DIAGNOSE THERAPISTS

19:06.213 --> 19:07.780
WHOSE MARRIAGES FELL APART,

19:07.880 --> 19:11.451
HOW MANY CASES
OF EROTIC TRANSFERENCE
WOULD THEY FIND?"

19:12.585 --> 19:14.621
WHAT DOES--
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

19:14.721 --> 19:18.325
THAT SOMETIMES EROTIC
TRANSFERENCE IN THERAPY

19:18.425 --> 19:20.560
IS A TEST
OF YOUR MARRIED LIFE.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.430
IF A THERAPIST CAN'T
HANDLE A SITUATION

19:23.530 --> 19:25.365
WHERE HIS PATIENT FALLS
IN LOVE WITH HIM,

19:25.465 --> 19:28.034
IT MAY INDICATE SOME BREAKDOWN
IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE.

19:28.134 --> 19:30.203
YES, BUT I DON'T THINK
MY MARRIAGE TO KATE

19:30.303 --> 19:32.004
IS FALLING APART.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.073
YES, I HAD A ROW
WITH LAURA--

19:34.173 --> 19:35.975
I MEAN WITH KATE.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.044
WHOSE LAURA?
ROSIE'S FRIEND?

19:38.144 --> 19:40.313
( sighs )

19:40.413 --> 19:45.418
THE GIRL WITH THE ISSUE
OF EROTIC TRANSFERENCE.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.754
YOU DIDN'T
MENTION HER BY NAME.

19:48.955 --> 19:50.156
YOU JUST SAID
IT HAD COME UP.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.359
OKAY.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.527
SHE TOLD ME THAT...

19:56.229 --> 19:58.130
SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH ME

19:58.231 --> 20:00.933
AND THAT SHE WANTS
TO SLEEP WITH ME.

20:01.033 --> 20:02.969
OKAY.

20:03.069 --> 20:04.404
OKAY, WHAT?

20:04.504 --> 20:06.339
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT KATE FELT THAT

20:06.439 --> 20:08.140
AND THAT'S WHERE
OUR TENSIONS COME FROM?

20:08.241 --> 20:10.243
GOOD MATERIAL
FOR YOUR NOVEL, GINA.

20:10.343 --> 20:13.413
COME ON, YOU KNOW THAT
THERAPISTS GET DIVORCED

20:13.513 --> 20:15.448
LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.
PLEASE DON'T DRAW

20:15.548 --> 20:18.718
ANY CONCLUSIONS, BECAUSE
THERE ARE NONE TO BE DRAWN.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.954
BESIDES, MY TROUBLES AT HOME
DIDN'T BEGIN LAST WEEK

20:22.054 --> 20:23.390
OR LAST MONTH.

20:23.490 --> 20:25.625
HOW WOULD YOU SAY
HER THERAPY IS GOING?

20:25.725 --> 20:27.527
WHOSE THERAPY?

20:27.627 --> 20:31.264
YOU SAID, TALKING ABOUT
YOUR SESSIONS, THAT YOU

20:31.364 --> 20:34.501
CUT THINGS SHORT,
YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE,

20:34.601 --> 20:37.236
THAT YOU OFTEN FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT YOUR BEHAVIOR.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.238
IS THAT TRUE ALSO
WITH LINDA?

20:39.339 --> 20:42.141
- LAURA.
- SORRY, LAURA.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.311
LOOK, GINA,
YOU KNOW THAT

20:44.411 --> 20:47.380
PATIENTS FALL FOR THEIR
THERAPISTS EVERY FEW SECONDS.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.682
WHAT BETTER WAY IS THERE
TO AIR THIS

20:49.782 --> 20:51.284
THAN TO BRING IT
TO THE SURFACE

20:51.384 --> 20:53.420
AND PUT IT OUT THERE?

20:53.520 --> 20:55.888
YOU KNOW, THIS ROOM
IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SAFE ZONE

20:55.988 --> 20:59.258
WHERE WE CAN OPEN THINGS UP
AND TALK ABOUT THINGS
IN A CONTROLLED WAY.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.694
JUST TO MAKE THINGS
PERFECTLY CLEAR,

21:01.794 --> 21:06.766
THIS IS TRANSFERENCE,
PLAIN AND SIMPLE.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.168
OF COURSE YOU AND MITCHELL
AND YOUR NEW YORK GANG

21:09.268 --> 21:11.471
HAVE IDEALIZED IT.

21:13.740 --> 21:16.609
GINA, I DIDN'T COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT A PATIENT.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.245
I THINK YOU DID COME HERE
TO TALK ABOUT LAURA.

21:19.346 --> 21:21.481
INSTEAD, YOU KEEP
TALKING ABOUT KATE.

21:21.581 --> 21:24.384
YOU MENTIONED
TO ME, OFFHAND,

21:24.484 --> 21:27.354
THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE
OF EROTIC TRANSFERENCE,

21:27.454 --> 21:29.288
AND INSTEAD OF
FOCUSING ON THAT,

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
YOU GO ON TO TELL ME
ABOUT A COUPLE,

21:31.491 --> 21:32.859
A CLASS
FOR GIFTED CHILDREN,

21:32.959 --> 21:35.462
A NEW GIRL
WHO GOES TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:35.562 --> 21:38.130
SO WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO PROVE HERE, PAUL?

21:38.230 --> 21:39.932
THAT YOU WON'T
TALK ABOUT HER?

21:40.032 --> 21:42.902
ABOUT LAURA? THAT YOU CAN
AVOID TALKING ABOUT HER?

21:43.002 --> 21:45.772
YOU KNOW WHAT, GINA?
I THINK THIS WAS A MISTAKE,

21:45.872 --> 21:47.340
COMING HERE TODAY.

21:47.440 --> 21:49.809
I-I--
I THINK I'D BETTER LEAVE.

21:49.909 --> 21:52.412
- WHY?
- BECAUSE YOU TWIST EVERYTHING

21:52.512 --> 21:54.514
INTO YOUR OWN
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS--

21:54.614 --> 21:56.849
WAS THERE PHYSICAL CONTACT?

21:56.949 --> 21:58.284
NO.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.952
YOU HESITATED BEFORE
YOU ANSWERED.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.522
BECAUSE I'M SHOCKED
AT WHERE THIS IS GOING.

22:02.622 --> 22:04.357
WHAT DO YOU THINK I DID?
SLEEP WITH THIS GIRL

22:04.457 --> 22:06.693
AND THEN COME HERE
TO CONFESS TO YOU?

22:06.793 --> 22:08.695
- WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
- WHEN DID WHAT HAPPEN?

22:08.795 --> 22:11.230
NOTHING HAPPENED. I KEEP
TELLING YOU NOTHING HAPPENED.

22:11.330 --> 22:14.300
NO. NO NO NO.
WHAT DID SHE SAY TO YOU?

22:14.401 --> 22:17.236
SHE SAID SHE WAS
IN LOVE WITH ME.

22:17.336 --> 22:20.006
THAT WAS JUST LAST MONDAY.

22:20.106 --> 22:21.874
THIS WEEK?

22:21.974 --> 22:23.676
YES.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.445
YES.

22:26.679 --> 22:29.982
WELL, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT
ME TO SAY, PAUL?

22:30.082 --> 22:33.285
YOU'RE MAKING IT
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR ME TO COME
BACK HERE TO ASK YOU FOR HELP,

22:33.386 --> 22:37.690
REMINDING ME ALL THE TIME
ABOUT HOW LONG IT'S BEEN SINCE
I'VE BEEN HERE, WHY I LEFT,

22:37.790 --> 22:40.393
HOW I FELT, HOW YOU FELT--
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

22:40.493 --> 22:43.162
WAS I THAT BIG
A DISAPPOINTMENT TO YOU?

22:43.262 --> 22:45.197
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
STAY YOUR LOYAL INTERN

22:45.297 --> 22:46.633
FOREVER AND EVER?

22:46.733 --> 22:49.135
I'M JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS

22:49.235 --> 22:50.803
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME.

22:50.903 --> 22:54.206
I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
MOVES YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.576
WHAT MOVES I'M
TRYING TO MAKE?

22:56.676 --> 22:58.144
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

22:58.244 --> 22:59.846
LEGITIMACY?

22:59.946 --> 23:01.614
LEGITIMACY FOR WHAT?

23:01.714 --> 23:03.349
HOW OLD IS THIS GIRL?

23:03.450 --> 23:06.753
SHE'S-- I DON'T
KNOW-- 30, 29.

23:06.853 --> 23:09.656
I JUST WONDER, WHEN YOU
TALK ABOUT FEELING GUILTY,

23:09.756 --> 23:12.592
IS IT ABOUT YOUR PATIENTS
GENERALLY THAT YOU
FEEL GUILTY?

23:12.692 --> 23:15.662
OR IS IT ABOUT ONE
PATIENT IN PARTICULAR?

23:15.762 --> 23:17.797
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK, GINA.

23:17.897 --> 23:20.232
( sighs )

23:20.332 --> 23:22.735
GOD, I HOPE YOUR NOVEL
DOESN'T SINK THIS LOW.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.336
WHAT'S BUGGING YOU SO MUCH?

23:24.437 --> 23:26.773
YOU ARE. YOU.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.976
IT'S UNBELIEVABLE HOW MUCH
YOU'RE ENJOYING YOURSELF.

23:30.076 --> 23:32.679
EROTIC TRANSFERENCE
HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.615
IT'S SIMPLY A QUESTION
OF HOW ONE DEALS WITH IT.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.884
NOW I KNOW
HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.787
CAN YOU HONESTLY
SAY TO YOURSELF

23:40.887 --> 23:43.523
THAT HER FALLING
IN LOVE WITH YOU

23:43.623 --> 23:45.725
IS JUST A PART
OF HER HEALING PROCESS?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.461
AND THAT IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU?

23:49.729 --> 23:52.131
MAYBE YOU'RE
A LITTLE WORRIED

23:52.231 --> 23:53.966
BECAUSE OF YOUR
FAMILY HISTORY...

23:55.434 --> 23:56.703
THAT IT COULD GO TOO FAR.

23:56.803 --> 23:59.438
GINA-- TIMING,
DOSAGE, TACT,

23:59.539 --> 24:02.108
YOU'RE FAILING IN ALL THREE.
I'M NOT MY FATHER.

24:02.208 --> 24:03.610
MY FATHER WAS A DOCTOR.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.812
HE LEFT THE HOUSE
OF ONE OF HIS PATIENTS.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.681
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
A GIRL WHO HAS A CRUSH
ON HER THERAPIST.

24:08.781 --> 24:11.551
IT'S A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT THING AND YOU KNOW
DAMN WELL IT IS.

24:11.651 --> 24:14.521
YOU SHOULD GET COUNSELING
REGARDING THIS LINDA.

24:14.621 --> 24:16.723
- LAURA.
- SORRY, LAURA.

24:16.823 --> 24:20.026
LET'S NOT CALL IT COUNSELING.
LET'S CALL IT TALKING.

24:20.126 --> 24:22.629
LAURA-- LAURA IS HER NAME.

24:22.729 --> 24:25.565
GOD, YOU'RE SO CAUGHT UP
IN YOUR LITTLE THEORIES

24:25.665 --> 24:28.000
THAT YOU DON'T EVEN
REMEMBER HER NAME.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.707
WHY DON'T YOU ASK HER?

24:34.807 --> 24:36.408
ASK WHO?

24:36.509 --> 24:38.845
- KATE.
- WHAT, IF SHE'S
SEEING SOMEBODY?

24:38.945 --> 24:41.313
OH, WELL,

24:41.413 --> 24:42.749
THAT WOULD MAKE
YOU HAPPY, I BET.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.450
I THINK
YOU SHOULD ASK HER

24:44.551 --> 24:46.285
INSTEAD OF DRIVING
YOURSELF CRAZY.

24:46.385 --> 24:47.920
I'M NOT DRIVING
MYSELF CRAZY.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.523
- ARE YOU AFRAID
TO FIND OUT IT'S TRUE?
- YES, I AM.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.492
- BUT YOU'RE CONVINCED IT'S NOT.
- CORRECT.

24:57.764 --> 24:59.298
I'LL TELL YOU WHY:

24:59.398 --> 25:02.201
BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT
BEING HELPFUL.

25:02.301 --> 25:04.003
HELPFUL.

25:07.473 --> 25:10.209
NOW I'M TOTALLY CONFUSED.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.078
I MEAN, DID YOU COME HERE

25:12.178 --> 25:14.881
TO ASK FOR MY GUIDANCE?

25:14.981 --> 25:17.850
OR TO TALK TO ME
AS A FRIEND?

25:17.950 --> 25:20.553
ARE YOU SEEKING ADVICE
FROM A COLLEAGUE?

25:20.653 --> 25:23.122
WHAT ROLE
HAVE YOU ASSIGNED ME?

25:24.557 --> 25:27.293
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT
BUT I'M FAILING!

25:40.072 --> 25:41.741
LISTEN, PAUL...

25:45.011 --> 25:47.246
IT'S NOT EASY
FOR ME EITHER,

25:47.346 --> 25:50.349
SEEING YOU
AFTER ALL THIS TIME.

25:50.449 --> 25:54.086
YOU WALKED THROUGH THAT DOOR
AFTER EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED

25:54.186 --> 25:56.022
AS THOUGH IT WAS NOTHING.

25:58.224 --> 26:00.059
IT WAS CONFUSING.

26:01.393 --> 26:03.462
I COULDN'T THINK
OF ANYBODY ELSE

26:03.562 --> 26:05.832
TO TALK TO.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.969
YOU KNOW
WHAT BOTHERS ME?

26:10.069 --> 26:11.537
WHEN I WALKED
THROUGH THE DOOR,

26:11.638 --> 26:14.573
I FELT THAT YOU LOOKED
AT ME WITH GLEE.

26:14.674 --> 26:17.176
AND YOU THOUGHT,
"OH, HERE HE COMES AGAIN--

26:17.276 --> 26:19.278
PAUL, THE FAILURE."

26:19.378 --> 26:21.213
AND I THOUGHT,

26:21.313 --> 26:23.616
"SHE'S BEEN SITTING HERE
LIKE A SLEEPY OLD SPIDER,

26:23.716 --> 26:25.151
JUST WAITING,

26:25.251 --> 26:27.486
WAITING FOR SOMETHING
LIKE THIS TO HAPPEN."

26:27.586 --> 26:30.022
LOOK AT YOU.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.824
YOU'VE WOKEN UP.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.094
YOU'RE FULL OF LIFE.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.798
( sighs )

26:44.303 --> 26:47.840
IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU FEEL,
MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T MEET.

26:51.377 --> 26:53.045
YEAH.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.614
MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH
A GOOD IDEA AFTER ALL.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.688
YOU SHOULD GET...

27:03.189 --> 27:06.025
PROFESSIONAL HELP
REGARDING THIS LAURA.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.728
I DON'T NEED IT.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.731
I THINK YOU DO.

27:13.800 --> 27:16.836
IN ANY CASE, IF YOU FEEL
LIKE TALKING, CALL ME.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.041
I WOULDN'T BE WAITING ON THE END
OF A TELEPHONE IF I WAS YOU.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.577
( laughs )

27:25.678 --> 27:28.347
WHY DO THESE QUESTIONS
MAKE YOU SO ANGRY?

27:28.447 --> 27:31.017
I'M NOT ANGRY.
I'M REALLY NOT.

27:33.352 --> 27:34.987
WHY ARE YOU RUNNING AWAY?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.323
I'M NOT RUNNING AWAY, GINA.

27:41.928 --> 27:44.130
GIVE MY BEST TO KATE.

27:44.230 --> 27:47.266
I WILL.

27:47.366 --> 27:51.037
TALK TO HER ABOUT IT.
IT'LL MAKE THINGS
EASIER FOR YOU.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.741
GOOD NIGHT, GINA.

27:56.475 --> 28:00.246
( dog barking )

28:03.015 --> 28:05.684
( jazz music playing )
