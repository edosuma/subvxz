¶¶

00:09.510 --> 00:12.478
<i>¶ I was a girl in the village</i>
<i> Doing all right ¶</i>

00:12.480 --> 00:14.847
<i> ¶ Then I became a princess</i>
<i> Overnight ¶</i>

00:14.849 --> 00:17.616
<i> ¶ Now I got to figure out</i>

00:17.618 --> 00:19.385
<i> ¶ So much to learn and see ¶</i>

00:19.387 --> 00:22.521

00:22.523 --> 00:25.224

[reading onscreen text]

01:00.728 --> 01:02.594
[Zooey]
I hereby bring this meeting

01:02.596 --> 01:04.363
of the Princess Adventure Club
to order.

01:04.365 --> 01:06.398
First, I have
an important announcement.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.900
At next week's meeting,
we will present

01:07.902 --> 01:11.336
the Princess Adventure
Club's Scroll of Discovery.

01:11.338 --> 01:13.672
-The Scroll of Discovery?
-The scroll of what?

01:13.674 --> 01:15.741
Um... what is that again, Zooey?

01:15.743 --> 01:17.242
It's a list
of the amazing things

01:17.244 --> 01:18.777
each member of our club
has discovered

01:18.779 --> 01:20.946
on our adventures.
And the best part:

01:20.948 --> 01:24.183
it'll be displayed in the school
trophy case for everyone to see.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.418
You mean like when I found
that ancient idol

01:26.420 --> 01:27.686
in the temples of Tangu?

01:27.688 --> 01:30.589
Exactly.
That was an amazing discovery.

01:30.591 --> 01:32.858
And I discovered that new
species of rainbow moth.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.693
And I discovered
a star.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.795
Amberina Major.
Did you get that?

01:36.797 --> 01:39.364
"Amberina" means it was
named after me?

01:39.366 --> 01:41.266
-Yeah, we got it.
-How about you, Hildy?

01:41.268 --> 01:42.634
What have you discovered?

01:42.636 --> 01:44.269
Oh, uh... it's...

01:44.271 --> 01:45.737
it's hard to choose.

01:45.739 --> 01:47.906
So many big things
come to mind.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.908
So, everyone think about
what to put under your name

01:49.910 --> 01:52.311
on the Scroll of Discovery,
and have it ready for next week.

01:52.313 --> 01:53.946
Now, the second order
of business:

01:53.948 --> 01:55.781
our next adventure.

01:55.783 --> 01:58.517
Follow me to the Map Room
and I'll tell you all about it.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.791
What's wrong, Hildy?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.593
Nothing, except everyone else
has discovered

02:07.595 --> 02:09.661
such incredible things.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.463
What have I done
in the club?

02:11.465 --> 02:14.099
Seriously, Sofia,
make me a list.

02:14.101 --> 02:16.668
You're always
very well dressed.

02:16.670 --> 02:17.769
Keep going.

02:17.771 --> 02:19.471
And your hair
always looks nice?

02:19.473 --> 02:21.406
Yes, I look fabulous.

02:21.408 --> 02:25.010
But suddenly, that doesn't seem
as impressive as, say,

02:25.012 --> 02:26.812
discovering a star.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.748
Face it, Sofia,
I'm mediocre.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.784
Oh, Hildy, you're just as good
as anyone in the club.

02:32.786 --> 02:35.454
But I'm supposed to be better
than everyone in the club.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.089
You're making
too much of this.

02:37.091 --> 02:38.690
It's just a scroll.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.292
Just a scroll?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.860
Everyone in the school
will look at it

02:41.862 --> 02:43.162
to see what our
accomplishments were,

02:43.164 --> 02:47.032
and they'll see that I was...
ugh, unmemorable.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.967
Well, we have a new adventure
coming up.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.770
Who knows? Maybe you'll discover
something amazing

02:51.772 --> 02:53.639
on this trip that you can put
in the scroll.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.840
That's right.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.441
I've still got time
to find something.

02:56.443 --> 03:00.445
The best something
anyone has ever found.

03:00.447 --> 03:02.481
For our next
Princess Adventure Club trip,

03:02.483 --> 03:04.516
I propose that we explore

03:04.518 --> 03:06.985
The Lost Pyramids
of Khaldoun.

03:06.987 --> 03:11.023
Uh, how can the pyramids be lost
when you have a map of them?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.457
They were lost for ages.

03:12.459 --> 03:14.159
An evil wizard named Hizzan
built them

03:14.161 --> 03:16.128
to hide his stolen
treasures.

03:16.130 --> 03:18.030
But just recently,
the famous archeomagicologist

03:18.032 --> 03:20.899
Princess Cassandra,
who is my hero and my pen pal,

03:20.901 --> 03:23.669
made headlines by discovering
four of them.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.637
What's an archeomagicologist?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.906
Somebody who studies
ancient magical objects.

03:27.908 --> 03:30.175
And no one's better at it
than Cassandra.

03:30.177 --> 03:32.344
Just look at all these books
she's written.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.246
And her name is on
all of them.

03:34.248 --> 03:35.981
Now that is impressive.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.250
You said she found
four of the lost pyramids.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.851
How many are there?

03:39.853 --> 03:43.055
Five. And the fifth one has
the greatest treasure of all.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.324
-How do we find it?
-It won't be easy.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.059
Legends say the five pyramids
were laid out

03:47.061 --> 03:48.493
in some kind of pattern,

03:48.495 --> 03:50.696
but no one has ever
figured it out.

03:50.698 --> 03:51.930
Oh, please.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.032
If this archeomagi-whosits
Cassandra

03:54.034 --> 03:57.569
can't find the fifth pyramid,
what hope do we have?

03:57.571 --> 03:59.071
-Hildegard...
-I say we forget this

03:59.073 --> 04:01.506
and come up with something
easier for me to discover.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.642
I mean, us...
to discover.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.011
Hildegard, look.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.915
Could the evil wizard
have arranged his pyramids

04:09.917 --> 04:11.483
in the shape of a hand?

04:12.419 --> 04:13.685
[Sofia gasps]

04:13.687 --> 04:15.254
Nice detective work, Sofia.

04:15.256 --> 04:17.389
If your theory is correct,
then the fifth pyramid

04:17.391 --> 04:20.459
would be right
where Hildy's thumb is.

04:20.461 --> 04:21.860
My thumb?

04:21.862 --> 04:23.795
[Sofia] There's only one way
to find out.

04:23.797 --> 04:26.231
Zooey, let's fire up
the hydrofoil.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.432
Princess Adventure Club,

04:27.434 --> 04:29.801
let's find the lost
Pyramid of Khaldoun.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.938
And to think, I'm the one
who made this discovery.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.974
My name is going to be in books,
just like Princess Cassandra.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.976
Hip-hip hooray for me.

04:37.978 --> 04:41.213
Uh, Hildy, Sofia is actually
the one who figured it out.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.981
But I put my thumb on it.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.750
Yeah, but that was just
by chance.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.486
-Was it, Zooey?
-Hildy has a point.

04:47.488 --> 04:50.155
I never would've figured it out
without her hand being there.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.891
-See?
-Uh, okay.

04:52.893 --> 04:56.094
Sofia, thanks for letting me
take the credit for this.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.563
It's okay, Hildy.
I don't mind sharing the credit.

04:58.565 --> 05:00.832
Sharing? What do you mean?

05:00.834 --> 05:03.068
Well, we both played a part
in the discovery,

05:03.070 --> 05:05.504
so it was kind of
a team effort.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.106
What? No one will be impressed
if I was just a part

05:08.108 --> 05:09.775
of a "team effort."

05:09.777 --> 05:11.943
You've already done so much,
Sofia.

05:11.945 --> 05:15.314
Why can't you give me this
one itty-bitty huge discovery

05:15.316 --> 05:16.448
for myself?

05:16.450 --> 05:18.283
Because it isn't the truth,
Hildy.

05:18.285 --> 05:20.786
Well, if you're going
to be a stickler,

05:20.788 --> 05:22.254
I'll just have to discover
something

05:22.256 --> 05:23.689
even more super-important
on this trip

05:23.691 --> 05:27.492
that I can claim credit for
all by myself.

05:30.664 --> 05:34.099
So you want me to fly you
to this empty patch of desert?

05:34.101 --> 05:36.835
[Zooey]
Yeah. Take a left at the pinkie
and head for the thumb.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.571
Aye, aye, Captain Zooey.

05:40.607 --> 05:43.041
[roars]

05:43.043 --> 05:45.243
Hey, someone's flying
towards us.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.886
The Princess Adventure Club,
I presume?

05:54.888 --> 05:56.488
Princess Cassandra.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.789
I sent her a message.

05:57.791 --> 05:59.558
And when I heard that you had
possibly discovered

05:59.560 --> 06:01.693
the missing fifth pyramid
of Khaldoun,

06:01.695 --> 06:03.762
I had to see
for myself.

06:03.764 --> 06:05.230
She's going to be
our guide.

06:05.232 --> 06:07.132
It's great
to meet you all.

06:07.134 --> 06:10.001
So, which one of you
figured it out?

06:10.003 --> 06:11.903
Well, actually, I--

06:11.905 --> 06:13.572
It was a team effort.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.173
Monumental.

06:15.175 --> 06:18.343
Every archeomagicologist needs
as much help as she can get.

06:18.345 --> 06:19.745
Sally, dismount.

06:21.014 --> 06:22.581
-What is that?
-This is Sally,

06:22.583 --> 06:24.149
my guide lemur.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.385
She helps me get around
without bumping into things.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.353
Cassandra, are you blind?

06:28.355 --> 06:30.088
What gave me away?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.057
Are my socks
mismatched again?

06:32.059 --> 06:34.226
You never mentioned in
your letters you couldn't see.

06:34.228 --> 06:36.027
Well, you never mentioned
you could.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.896
-Good point.
-[bell clangs]

06:37.898 --> 06:40.399
Attention, everyone.
We have arrived.

06:40.401 --> 06:43.402
Monumental. So what do you say,
princesses?

06:43.404 --> 06:45.437
Shall we go make history?

06:55.916 --> 06:57.916
[pilot]
Brace for landing!

07:02.456 --> 07:04.423
[bell clanging]

07:06.693 --> 07:09.394
Prepare to disembark.

07:09.396 --> 07:12.731
Watch out, watch out.
One side. One side, please.

07:12.733 --> 07:14.433
I'm going to be the first one
to find...

07:14.435 --> 07:15.767
[gasps]

07:18.539 --> 07:19.538
Tell me what you see.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.806
Just sand.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.407
Sand, sand and more sand.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.309
There's no pyramid here.

07:24.311 --> 07:26.044
I guess Sofia got it wrong.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.246
I thought you said
it was your idea.

07:28.248 --> 07:29.981
Well, that's when I thought
it was a good idea.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.416
It might still be.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.119
That wizard, Hizzan,
was pretty tricky.

07:34.121 --> 07:37.823
This pyramid is probably hidden
even better than the others.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.191
I'll find it!

07:40.494 --> 07:43.628
Hey, I found a rock...
and another rock.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.464
And here's a third rock.

07:45.466 --> 07:46.932
But no pyramid.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.434
Ugh! We're never going
to find it that way.

07:49.436 --> 07:52.838
Oh, if only there was some way
to clear all the sand away.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.473
Sometimes the answer
to a problem

07:54.475 --> 07:57.309
is staring you right in the face
and you don't even know it.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.214
[wind gusting]

08:07.120 --> 08:08.854
It is staring me
in the face.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.489
I know how to blow
the sand away.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.090
Everyone, quick,
get back on the hydrofoil.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.358
I've got an idea.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.360
[engine chugging]

08:30.277 --> 08:32.477
[Sofia]
Zooey, you did it!

08:32.479 --> 08:34.779
Yeah, look at that stone
with the picture of a--

08:34.781 --> 08:36.615
A sphinx! I see it.

08:36.617 --> 08:38.650
And I'm closest.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.519
Maybe if I just...

08:40.521 --> 08:42.687
[rumbling]

08:54.801 --> 08:56.401
Uh... wow.

08:56.403 --> 08:59.738
I did it!
I found the lost pyramid!

08:59.740 --> 09:01.239
Well, you and Zooey.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.241
She came up with the idea
to blow the sand away.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.211
Ugh! Another team effort?

09:06.213 --> 09:09.581
This whole trip is turning out
to be a royal bummer.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.251
-[monkey chitters]
-But we've just begun.

09:13.253 --> 09:16.021
There's a lot more to do
than just locate the pyramid.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.823
We've got to explore it
and find the treasure.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.926
So, who's first?

09:20.928 --> 09:22.427
Me! Me! Me!

09:29.703 --> 09:31.836
Hey, it's dark in here.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.505
How are we going to see
where we're going?

09:33.507 --> 09:36.374
The other pyramids
were lined with Forever Torches

09:36.376 --> 09:37.742
along the walls.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.411
Feel around and find one.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.785
Got one.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.720
Now pull on it.
Does it light up?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.522
Yes!

09:51.425 --> 09:52.857
[Sofia]
Amazing.

09:52.859 --> 09:54.125
Way to go, Cassandra.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.264
It's a dead end.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.865
There's no way forward.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.468
Just this writing
on the wall.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.870
Hieroglyphics? Monumental!

10:05.872 --> 10:09.574
A long ago, people used to write
in pictures instead of words.

10:09.576 --> 10:11.209
Should we describe them
to you?

10:11.211 --> 10:12.444
No need.

10:12.446 --> 10:13.812
[sighs]

10:16.149 --> 10:19.217
This is how I fell in love
with archeomagicology.

10:19.219 --> 10:20.952
Because it's carved
in the stone,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.321
I can read the writing
with my fingers.

10:23.323 --> 10:24.656
Beautiful.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.992
Just as I suspected.
It's here.

10:26.994 --> 10:29.561
-What's here?
-Each of Hizzan's pyramids

10:29.563 --> 10:30.962
had a magic treasure in it,

10:30.964 --> 10:33.965
but this one holds the greatest
treasure of all.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.667
The Oasis Stone.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.170
Exactly, Zooey.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.672
The whole valley used to be lush
with plants and animals.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.140
If we can find
the Oasis Stone,

10:42.142 --> 10:44.776
we can magically restore it
to the way it was.

10:44.778 --> 10:46.745
We should totally
do that.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.947
These symbols say
the Oasis Stone

10:48.949 --> 10:50.915
rests in the central chamber
of the pyramid.

10:50.917 --> 10:53.084
But the wizard placed
many challenges and traps

10:53.086 --> 10:54.319
along the way.

10:54.321 --> 10:56.321
If we follow
the jackal symbols,

10:56.323 --> 10:57.956
they'll lead us
to the central chamber,

10:57.958 --> 11:00.825
Someone press this symbol,
and away we'll go.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.996
A magic stone that will restore
life to the desert?

11:04.998 --> 11:07.165
I'm going to be the first one
to find it.

11:08.502 --> 11:09.834
[loud clang]

11:12.773 --> 11:15.640
A secret door.
I love this already.

11:15.642 --> 11:16.975
I'm first. I'm first.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.243
I'm-- whoa!

11:19.846 --> 11:22.113
It's a pit.
We can't get through.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.015
That must be
the first trap.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.450
There's always a way
to get through.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.951
You just have to look.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.319
I don't see a way.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.388
That's because you're looking
with your eyes.

11:30.390 --> 11:33.958
Close them. and try reaching out
with your other senses.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.126
[sniffs]

11:35.128 --> 11:36.561
-What do you smell?
-[all sniffing]

11:36.563 --> 11:38.063
Hildy's perfume.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.364
Oh, it's nice.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.699
Thanks you, Amber.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.067
It's my own fragrance.

11:42.069 --> 11:44.135
Fleur de Freezenburg.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.372
-Anything else?
-I smell moss.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.707
-I do too.
-Good.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.675
Sally, find the moss.

11:50.677 --> 11:51.976
[squeaks and chitters]

11:58.185 --> 12:02.587
Yup. And it's just the ticket
to get us across this pit.

12:13.200 --> 12:15.200
There you go.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.168
You're starting to see
that you don't always

12:17.170 --> 12:20.171
have to rely on what you see.

12:20.173 --> 12:24.175
Sometimes your other senses
can get you through.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.878
¶ You use your eyes to see
What's in front of you ¶

12:26.880 --> 12:30.181
¶ They tell you most
Of what you need to know ¶

12:30.183 --> 12:34.385
¶ But you've got other senses
To get you through ¶

12:34.387 --> 12:39.190
¶ To find all the things
Your eyes could never show ¶

12:40.560 --> 12:43.595
¶ And, yes, I know you just want
To charge ahead ¶

12:43.597 --> 12:47.065
¶ But there may be things
That block your way ¶

12:47.067 --> 12:50.235
¶ Instead of looking
Feel all around instead ¶

12:50.237 --> 12:52.804
¶ And you'll sense
What lies ahead ¶

12:52.806 --> 12:55.373
¶ From a mile away ¶

12:56.376 --> 12:57.742
¶ When it's cloudy or dark ¶

12:57.744 --> 12:59.444
¶ And you can't see much ¶

12:59.446 --> 13:02.614
¶ Reach out with your hearing
Your smell and your touch ¶

13:02.616 --> 13:07.218
¶ If you're feeling fenced in
By what you can't see ¶

13:07.220 --> 13:08.920
¶ Break down those fences ¶

13:08.922 --> 13:13.291
¶ And come to your senses
With me ¶

13:16.997 --> 13:20.298
¶ When you can't see exactly
What to do ¶

13:20.300 --> 13:23.234
¶ Close your eyes and try
To use your ears ¶

13:23.236 --> 13:27.138
¶ Listen close and hear
What's in front of you ¶

13:27.140 --> 13:30.475
¶ And maybe the way out
Will at last appear ¶

13:30.477 --> 13:33.111
I found a hidden door!

13:33.113 --> 13:35.246
¶ When it's cloudy or dark
And you can't see much ¶

13:35.248 --> 13:39.150
¶ Reach out with your hearing
Your smell and your touch ¶

13:39.152 --> 13:43.788
¶ If you're feeling fenced in
By what you can't see ¶

13:43.790 --> 13:45.290
¶ Break down those fences ¶

13:45.292 --> 13:48.359
¶ And come to your senses
With me ¶

13:49.329 --> 13:50.595
[all]
¶ We're on an adventure ¶

13:50.597 --> 13:52.430
¶ Seeking for glory ¶

13:52.432 --> 13:55.633
¶ But what we can see
Doesn't tell the whole story ¶

13:55.635 --> 13:57.135
¶ We're feeling our way ¶

13:57.137 --> 13:59.170
¶ We're listening and smelling ¶

13:59.172 --> 14:03.541
¶ And where it will lead us
There's really no telling ¶

14:03.543 --> 14:07.278
¶ When it's cloudy or dark
And we can't see much ¶

14:07.280 --> 14:08.947
¶ We'll reach out
With our hearing ¶

14:08.949 --> 14:10.715
¶ Our smell and our touch ¶

14:10.717 --> 14:14.052
¶ When we're feeling fenced in
And we can't get through ¶

14:14.054 --> 14:16.754
¶ We'll break down
Those fences ¶

14:17.791 --> 14:20.892
¶ And come to our senses ¶

14:20.894 --> 14:23.261
¶ With you ¶

14:27.634 --> 14:30.702
¶ We've come to our senses ¶

14:30.704 --> 14:33.938
¶ With you ¶

14:40.680 --> 14:42.313
Oh, I'm soaked!

14:42.315 --> 14:44.482
I never thought I could get
this wet in the desert.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.485
[water drips]

14:47.487 --> 14:49.520
You all stay here
and dry off.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.822
I'll scout ahead.

14:53.326 --> 14:54.993
[squeaking and chirping]

14:57.163 --> 14:58.396
I can come with you.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.736
Adventures are fun,

15:04.738 --> 15:06.571
but they take a toll
on your wardrobe.

15:06.573 --> 15:08.773
Wait, Amber.
Don't touch that.

15:08.775 --> 15:10.408
Oops.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.612
Just push on the torch
to make them all light up again.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.215
Which torch?
I can't find it now.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.851
Oh! Now I've knocked them down.

15:19.853 --> 15:21.185
What are we going to do?

15:21.187 --> 15:22.787
We're going to make our way
out of here

15:22.789 --> 15:24.589
and catch up
to Cassandra and Hildy.

15:24.591 --> 15:26.557
But we can't see anything.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.559
Remember what Cassandra said.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.428
Our other senses
will get us through.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.764
-[wind gusting]
-I feel a breeze.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.299
It must be coming
from the open door

15:34.301 --> 15:35.733
at the end of the hall.

15:35.735 --> 15:37.268
I'll throw these pebbles
ahead of us,

15:37.270 --> 15:39.370
so we can hear if anything's
blocking our path.

15:44.411 --> 15:45.643
Watch out.

15:45.645 --> 15:46.978
There's a stone to our left.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.379
We're on our way.

15:53.153 --> 15:54.419
[sighs]

15:54.421 --> 15:55.753
Okay, I think we've gone
far enough.

15:55.755 --> 15:57.622
I'll go back
and get the others.

15:58.892 --> 16:04.028
Right. And I'll, uh, stay here
and look around a little.

16:13.273 --> 16:15.239
[gasps]
A jackal.

16:15.241 --> 16:18.443
We're supposed to follow these
to get to the Oasis Stone.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.078
Whoa!

16:21.481 --> 16:23.014
It was dark,
but we did it.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.916
We used our other senses,
like you said.

16:24.918 --> 16:26.651
Monumental.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.020
Where's Hildy?

16:29.022 --> 16:30.521
I left her right here.

16:31.825 --> 16:33.658
Well, there's only
one door.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.594
She must've gone ahead.
This way.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.996
Let's go. We're close.

16:37.998 --> 16:39.597
I can feel it.

16:39.599 --> 16:40.665
[sniffing]

16:40.667 --> 16:42.500
And I can smell it.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.936
Fleur de Freezenburg.
Hildy's perfume.

16:44.938 --> 16:46.971
But it's not coming
from the door.

16:46.973 --> 16:49.607
It's coming
from over here.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.710
Ah-ha.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.113
Just like I thought.
A jackal.

16:55.115 --> 16:56.681
Hey, guys, wait.
I found a--

16:56.683 --> 16:58.116
Whoa!

17:00.887 --> 17:03.021
That must be it.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.722
The Oasis Stone!

17:05.692 --> 17:07.625
Hildy, stop!

17:07.627 --> 17:09.027
I found it, Sofia.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.995
I found the Oasis Stone.

17:10.997 --> 17:12.663
Now all I have to do
is grab it,

17:12.665 --> 17:14.565
and I'll have the greatest
discovery in the history

17:14.567 --> 17:16.467
of the Princess
Adventure Club.

17:16.469 --> 17:19.070
But this whole pyramid has been
filled with booby traps.

17:19.072 --> 17:21.539
We should wait for Cassandra
and the others.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.741
No. I've got to claim it first,

17:23.743 --> 17:26.644
or they'll show up and it'll be
another "team effort."

17:26.646 --> 17:29.080
But that's what we are.
A team.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.023
Who disturbs my slumber?

17:39.025 --> 17:40.992
Whoa.

17:40.994 --> 17:42.894
Uh-oh. Hildy, run!

17:42.896 --> 17:45.263
But I need that stone.

17:45.265 --> 17:47.265
The Oasis Stone
has remained hidden

17:47.267 --> 17:49.500
beneath the sands
of Khaldoun

17:49.502 --> 17:52.236
for age upon age.

17:52.238 --> 17:55.039
Who has discovered
its location?

17:55.041 --> 17:58.109
-Hildy, come on.
-It's okay, Sofia.

17:58.111 --> 17:59.877
I discovered it.

17:59.879 --> 18:01.679
Most impressive.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.749
Thank you.
I did it all by myself.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.851
And who found the carving

18:06.853 --> 18:10.021
that lifted the pyramid
out of the sand?

18:10.023 --> 18:11.756
Me. That was me.

18:11.758 --> 18:14.759
And did you make it through
all my master's booby traps

18:14.761 --> 18:16.060
to get here?

18:16.062 --> 18:17.595
Yes, yes. Me again.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.064
Congratulations,
Princess Hildegard.

18:20.066 --> 18:23.367
You have earned
a most special reward.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.936
Hey, Sofia,
did you hear that?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.204
I'm going to get--

18:26.206 --> 18:27.505
whoa!

18:30.076 --> 18:32.243
-Hildy!
-Sofia, help!

18:32.245 --> 18:33.878
Please release my friend.

18:33.880 --> 18:35.546
I think not.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.782
My ancient duty
is to wait here.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.384
And if someone tries
to take the Oasis Stone,

18:40.386 --> 18:42.553
I am ordered
to capture them.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.388
But we didn't know
about your rules.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.924
Now flee, or you shall
join your friend:

18:46.926 --> 18:49.527
imprisoned here
for all eternity.

18:51.965 --> 18:53.231
[gasps]

18:53.233 --> 18:54.565
Don't worry, Hildy.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.067
I'll figure something out.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.002
Oh, no. Sofia!

19:00.940 --> 19:02.840
There she is. Sofia!

19:02.842 --> 19:04.408
Cassandra, Zooey!

19:04.410 --> 19:06.811
[Cassandra] Wedge something
in the door, quick.

19:13.453 --> 19:14.685
Did you find Hildegard?

19:14.687 --> 19:16.621
[Hildegard]
I'm here! I'm trapped!

19:16.623 --> 19:19.023
-Is there a sphinx?
-Yes, there is.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.292
Oh, I wish
you'd waited for us.

19:21.294 --> 19:23.494
[Hildegard]
I know. I should have.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.263
I'm sorry for the way
I've been acting.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.265
You should all escape now,
while you can.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.966
You should know us
better than that.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.434
We're not going
to leave you.

19:30.436 --> 19:32.170
We're the Princess
Adventure Club.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.005
And we're your friends.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.673
After all I've done?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.340
[Cassandra] Can't you see
how they feel about you?

19:37.343 --> 19:38.809
Can't you see?

19:38.811 --> 19:40.645
[gasps]
I know just how to get Hildy

19:40.647 --> 19:41.979
out of that trap.

19:41.981 --> 19:44.048
[indistinct whispering]

19:45.218 --> 19:47.885
That is a monumental idea.

19:50.123 --> 19:51.989
Excuse me, Miss Sphinx.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.474
You made a mistake.

19:53.475 --> 19:54.958
You said your job
was to capture anyone

19:54.961 --> 19:56.894
who tries to take
the Oasis Stone.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.463
But Hildy didn't try
to get it all by herself.

19:59.465 --> 20:01.365
Well, she said she did.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.668
Well, she didn't.
Not alone.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.070
I helped figure out where
the pyramid was on the map.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.206
And I came up with a way to blow
the sand off the stones

20:08.208 --> 20:10.074
and get us into this place.

20:10.076 --> 20:13.544
And I've been reading the
hieroglyphics along the way.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.012
Is this true?

20:15.014 --> 20:17.148
Well... yes.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.149
Every word.

20:18.151 --> 20:20.818
So, you admit
you are all responsible?

20:20.820 --> 20:23.054
And you want me
to capture you all?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.488
-Yes.
-Very well.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.757
Prepare to spend eternity in...

20:26.759 --> 20:28.826
Amber, now!

20:30.363 --> 20:32.830
What is happening?
I cannot see.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.333
[roars]

20:35.335 --> 20:36.567
[sniffs]

20:36.569 --> 20:38.069
Hildy's perfume.
I smell it.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.770
We've got you!

20:41.908 --> 20:43.241
Grab on, Hildy!

20:47.280 --> 20:48.879
[grunts]

20:48.881 --> 20:51.249
-Now hurry.
-One second.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.192
[roars]

21:01.194 --> 21:02.593
Ah-ha!

21:02.595 --> 21:04.295
[roaring and snarling]

21:08.534 --> 21:11.235
[all grunt]

21:11.237 --> 21:14.205
Hildy. Where is she?

21:14.207 --> 21:15.273
There!

21:21.147 --> 21:22.780
[roars]

21:30.089 --> 21:31.722
[camels grunt]

21:31.724 --> 21:33.457
[monkey chittering]

21:33.459 --> 21:34.959
Princess Sofia?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.560
Princess Cassandra!

21:36.562 --> 21:38.996
King Nasir?
What are you doing here?

21:38.998 --> 21:42.133
It isn't every day
the ground rumbles

21:42.135 --> 21:44.969
and an ancient pyramid
magically rises from nowhere.

21:44.971 --> 21:46.637
Is it the fabled
fifth pyramid?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.172
Yes, Your Majesty.

21:48.174 --> 21:51.409
These brave, smart,
adventurous girls discovered it.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.843
Oh, wondrous!

21:52.845 --> 21:54.745
Now, please, please tell me
you've acquired

21:54.747 --> 21:56.781
the legendary Oasis Stone.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.016
Unfortunately,
we didn't.

21:59.018 --> 22:00.451
We barely escaped with our--

22:00.453 --> 22:02.353
Actually,
I got the stone.

22:02.355 --> 22:03.587
[all gasp]

22:03.589 --> 22:05.189
I went back and found it
in the dark

22:05.191 --> 22:06.490
when everything
was going crazy.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.926
Oh, then you,
Princess Hildegard,

22:08.928 --> 22:12.330
have made the greatest discovery
in the history of Khaldoun.

22:12.332 --> 22:13.998
And you'll have
one fantastic entry

22:14.000 --> 22:15.900
for the Scroll of Discovery.

22:17.370 --> 22:19.103
Cassandra,
you were right.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.839
I've discovered something
a lot better than this stone.

22:21.841 --> 22:24.208
I've discovered
I have great friends.

22:27.680 --> 22:29.347
Thank you, King Nasir,

22:29.349 --> 22:32.316
but I didn't find the stone
all by myself.

22:32.318 --> 22:33.718
We all did it together.

22:33.720 --> 22:36.520
Then, together,
you shall all return the stone

22:36.522 --> 22:39.390
to where it belongs:
the top of the pyramid.

22:39.392 --> 22:42.259
And let the magic
transformation begin.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.068
Sofia, how does it look?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.236
Not bad.

22:52.238 --> 22:54.271
Not bad at all.
