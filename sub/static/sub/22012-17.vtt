00:00.163 --> 00:01.982
<i>Back in the '80s, TV gave us</i>

00:02.142 --> 00:04.126
<i>some of the most
iconic friendships ever.</i>

00:04.509 --> 00:06.843
<i>Ricky had Alfonso. Natalie had Blair.</i>

00:06.945 --> 00:09.412
<i>Tattoo had Ricardo Montalban.</i>

00:09.514 --> 00:12.482
<i>But the greatest friendships of
the decade came from my family.</i>

00:12.584 --> 00:14.918
<i>Barry had his trusted Jenkintown Posse.</i>

00:15.020 --> 00:17.387
<i>I ran with the badass theater geeks.</i>

00:17.489 --> 00:20.223
<i>And we were kings of the school, kinda.</i>

00:20.325 --> 00:23.693
<i>My dad's crew was our dog,
Lucky, and his ratty old chair.</i>

00:23.795 --> 00:25.128
<i>Even my mom found a group of friends.</i>

00:25.230 --> 00:26.129
<i>They were a gang</i>

00:26.231 --> 00:27.464
<i>of busybody yentas</i>

00:27.566 --> 00:29.999
<i>who proudly called
themselves the "Frentas."</i>

00:30.102 --> 00:31.568
<i>They were known for
their power-walking,</i>

00:31.670 --> 00:33.703
<i>gossiping, and matchmaking.</i>

00:33.805 --> 00:35.739
You are an expert.

00:35.841 --> 00:37.774
Beverly, this match is inspired.

00:37.876 --> 00:38.842
I know.

00:38.944 --> 00:40.410
I dug down deep and pictured myself

00:40.512 --> 00:41.978
being thanked at their wedding.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.480
Hey! We're sharing a private,

00:43.582 --> 00:45.381
supercharged, erotic moment over here!

00:45.484 --> 00:47.217
We've been spotted! Run! Run!

00:49.988 --> 00:51.521
<i>And the height of their Frentaship</i>

00:51.623 --> 00:53.089
<i>was their weekly brunches.</i>

00:53.191 --> 00:54.257
Guess who brought fresh-cut flowers.

00:54.359 --> 00:55.391
And guess who brought
bagels n' schmears.

00:55.494 --> 00:56.559
And guess who brought mimosas.

00:56.661 --> 00:58.495
Come on in! Sunday's funday!

01:03.535 --> 01:05.135
I just punished my insides.

01:05.203 --> 01:06.636
- I got to unbutton.
- Tummy so full.

01:06.705 --> 01:08.104
I'm a ticking time bomb.

01:08.173 --> 01:09.906
What happened to my eggs Florentine,

01:09.975 --> 01:12.542
crusty sausage puffs,
and fluffy Bevcakes?

01:12.611 --> 01:13.743
<i>Oh, that was for you guys?</i>

01:13.812 --> 01:15.512
Yes. Who else would it be for?

01:15.580 --> 01:17.981
We just thought someone
abandoned a four-person brunch,

01:18.049 --> 01:19.682
so we were like, "Let's go to town."

01:19.785 --> 01:21.885
It's fine. We can just have the bagels.

01:21.987 --> 01:23.486
- Linda, look out!
- They're back!

01:23.588 --> 01:26.156
I don't even know how they got here!

01:26.258 --> 01:27.223
They're like raccoons!

Not to be dramatic, but

01:54.452 --> 01:57.287
that will change your lives forever!

01:57.389 --> 01:58.721
I am talking about

01:58.824 --> 02:01.791
"Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat."

02:01.893 --> 02:04.394
The national tour starring
triple threat David Cassidy

02:04.496 --> 02:05.528
is coming to Philly.

02:05.630 --> 02:07.197
- Did you get us tickets?
- Better.

02:07.299 --> 02:10.466
In each city, they hire local
kids to be the children's choir

02:10.568 --> 02:12.435
that sings live onstage.

02:12.537 --> 02:15.605
And guess who sent them a
tape of last year's Winter Jam

02:15.707 --> 02:17.507
and harassed them until they said yes.

02:17.609 --> 02:18.942
- You?
- Me!

02:20.912 --> 02:22.111
Holy balls!

02:22.214 --> 02:24.447
We're gonna tread the boards
of the Walnut Street Theatre!

02:24.549 --> 02:25.648
I heard the kids in Pittsburgh

02:25.750 --> 02:27.617
got to have bios in the "Playbill"!

02:27.719 --> 02:29.319
We should dine at
restaurants while we can,

02:29.421 --> 02:31.421
'cause soon, we're gonna
be mobbed by adoring fans.

02:31.523 --> 02:34.824
All of your expectations
are completely reasonable.

02:34.926 --> 02:36.392
Next stop, Broadway!

02:40.065 --> 02:42.732
Dad, I have amazing news!

02:42.834 --> 02:45.134
All I need is for you to
drive me to play rehearsal

02:45.237 --> 02:47.070
in downtown Philly during
the height of rush hour

02:47.172 --> 02:48.471
for the next three months.

02:48.573 --> 02:50.640
Oh, that was the first
time I said that out loud.

02:50.742 --> 02:51.941
- Can I go back?
- Wait a minute.

02:52.043 --> 02:53.443
This is every day? What about homework?

02:53.545 --> 02:55.778
<i>Homework is for people
who can't do this.</i>

02:56.748 --> 02:58.648
Stop. I'm not gonna have you flunk out

02:58.750 --> 03:00.083
'cause of some goofy play.

03:00.185 --> 03:03.253
Goofy? Okay, let me put this
in terms you'll understand.

03:03.355 --> 03:04.554
This would be like if I was asked

03:04.656 --> 03:06.956
to do a hockey thing for, like...

03:07.058 --> 03:08.324
What's the Broadway of hockey?

03:08.426 --> 03:10.827
There's clearly no answer
that's gonna work for both of us.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.929
Dad, it's totally unfair if you say no.

03:13.031 --> 03:14.063
I mean, you drive Barry

03:14.165 --> 03:15.832
to his wrestling
matches and hockey games.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.100
Well, that's completely different.

03:17.202 --> 03:19.068
- How?
- I like those things.

03:19.170 --> 03:20.303
You see the distinction?

03:20.405 --> 03:22.138
<i>While my theater future looked bleak,</i>

03:22.240 --> 03:23.640
<i>Barry and his boys were watching</i>

03:23.742 --> 03:25.174
<i>their favorite movie, "Colors,"</i>

03:25.277 --> 03:28.177
<i>the story of gang life and
the friendships that survive.</i>

03:28.280 --> 03:29.913
Man, I always thought "Red Dawn"

03:30.015 --> 03:31.648
was the most awesome movie about colors,

03:31.750 --> 03:32.749
but it's "Colors."

03:32.851 --> 03:34.550
They're a fiercely
loyal group or friends.

03:34.653 --> 03:35.952
They're just like us, ya know?

03:36.054 --> 03:37.687
I love you, JTP.

03:37.789 --> 03:38.888
All: JTP.

03:38.990 --> 03:40.990
Oh, man, I feel like
I want to hug you guys.

03:41.092 --> 03:42.358
But let's play football instead.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.494
Frentas al fresco.

03:44.596 --> 03:46.329
Does it get any better than this, girls?

03:48.099 --> 03:49.499
That's pass interference!

03:49.567 --> 03:52.035
Essie Karp's big dumb
head got in the way!

03:52.137 --> 03:54.103
Sweet! Various cheeses.

03:54.205 --> 03:57.073
Oh, yeah.

03:57.142 --> 04:00.243
Barry! We're having Sunday
Funday in the backyard,

04:00.345 --> 04:02.078
<i>so you kids go play in the front yard.</i>

04:02.147 --> 04:04.580
Fine. We'll just play at Andy's house.

04:04.649 --> 04:06.983
His awesome mom is always so welcoming

04:07.085 --> 04:08.851
and makes the best snacks.

04:08.920 --> 04:10.753
It's Barry's new tactic
to bend Bev to his will.

04:10.822 --> 04:13.823
Please! I make mine with
love and lots of mayonnaise.

04:13.892 --> 04:15.391
She literally can't stand the idea

04:15.460 --> 04:16.826
of being replaced by another mom.

04:16.894 --> 04:20.897
Yeah, but she always makes
you feel at home, you know?

04:20.966 --> 04:23.499
<i>My body was your home for nine months.</i>

04:23.568 --> 04:24.467
Yeah, so you claim.

04:24.536 --> 04:26.035
Watch the master at work.

04:26.137 --> 04:28.905
Have fun with your
pals... Mrs. Goldberg.

04:31.609 --> 04:32.608
Barry, wait.

04:35.747 --> 04:36.846
Take the backyard.

04:36.915 --> 04:39.782
My real mom's love has brought me back!

04:39.851 --> 04:40.750
Oh!

04:40.819 --> 04:43.252
Ladies, always a pleasure.

04:44.289 --> 04:45.588
- JTP!
- JTP!

04:45.657 --> 04:47.323
Close call.

04:47.425 --> 04:49.559
They almost went to
another yard for football.

04:49.627 --> 04:51.327
Bev, we're your best friends.

04:51.396 --> 04:52.929
We help each other out
through thick and thin, right?

04:52.998 --> 04:54.564
- Of course.
- Then it's our job to tell you

04:54.632 --> 04:56.599
that boy manipulates
the hell out of you!

04:56.668 --> 04:58.034
- Played you like a fiddle.
- Please.

04:58.103 --> 05:00.737
<i>I invented emotional
blackmail and guilt.</i>

05:00.839 --> 05:01.971
That's my jam.

05:02.073 --> 05:03.740
Well, then he learned from the best.

05:03.808 --> 05:06.609
<i>Thanks to her friends, my mom
realized she was being played.</i>

05:06.678 --> 05:08.044
<i>Meanwhile, a play about Joseph</i>

05:08.113 --> 05:10.646
<i>made my friends divas
and me the odd man out.</i>

05:10.715 --> 05:12.715
Last night's rehearsal was amazing.

05:12.817 --> 05:14.784
I love how loose we all
get as the night wears on.

05:14.853 --> 05:17.487
Yeah, that's when David
Cassidy says the magic happens.

05:17.589 --> 05:19.689
Okay, stop the madness!

05:19.791 --> 05:21.657
None of you actually know David Cassidy.

05:21.760 --> 05:24.193
Adam! David is a colleague.

05:24.295 --> 05:26.129
I can't have this negativity.

05:26.231 --> 05:28.798
I have to perform tonight,
and if I'm not 100%,

05:28.900 --> 05:30.199
that's just not fair to the audience.

05:30.268 --> 05:31.467
I'm gonna say something
controversial, Adam.

05:31.536 --> 05:32.802
I think you're acting
petty 'cause you're jealous.

05:32.904 --> 05:35.071
Of course I am! You're rubbing elbows

05:35.173 --> 05:36.939
with the hottest stars
of regional theater

05:37.008 --> 05:38.674
<i>and getting special treatment at school.</i>

05:38.777 --> 05:39.942
Hey, when we're here,

05:40.045 --> 05:43.046
we're just regular
students, like everyone else.

05:43.148 --> 05:45.715
Okay! Time for some vocal warm-ups!

05:45.817 --> 05:47.817
Of course, those of
you who are in "Joseph"

05:47.886 --> 05:49.585
can come with me for some hot cocoa

05:49.687 --> 05:50.820
in the teachers lounge.

05:50.889 --> 05:54.323
I can't have my stars
straining their voices.

05:54.392 --> 05:56.325
Um, what about the rest of us?

05:56.394 --> 05:58.528
Oh. Uh, you have a sub this period.

05:59.998 --> 06:01.764
All right, you musical scrubs!

06:01.833 --> 06:03.666
It's my understanding that you guys are

06:03.735 --> 06:06.169
the theatrical equivalent
of bench riders.

06:06.237 --> 06:08.971
So, I'm gonna whip you into
shape with some suicide scales

06:09.074 --> 06:10.173
and some voice sprints.

06:10.241 --> 06:11.574
Those aren't real things, Coach.

06:11.643 --> 06:13.076
Also, I should be with the talent,

06:13.144 --> 06:14.710
not stuck here with these dirtbags

06:14.813 --> 06:16.312
who take choir for an easy "A."

06:16.381 --> 06:18.047
Why are you never this
fired up in gym class?

06:18.149 --> 06:19.749
'Cause I'm a theater geek, Coach,

06:19.818 --> 06:21.150
not that you'd ever understand.

06:21.219 --> 06:23.286
That's a flag on the assumption!

06:23.388 --> 06:25.154
Really? You like musicals?

06:25.223 --> 06:27.957
Last month, my lady love,
Ms. Cinoman, dragged me

06:28.026 --> 06:30.693
to a community college
for an evening of theater.

06:30.762 --> 06:33.296
I had prepared myself
for a night of misery,

06:33.364 --> 06:34.564
when out of nowhere,

06:34.632 --> 06:40.570
this troupe of cats came
crawling down the aisle.

06:40.638 --> 06:42.939
They were singing, dancing,

06:43.041 --> 06:47.510
with their athletic thighs
and their gymnastic voices.

06:47.579 --> 06:49.579
I wish I could remember
what that show was called.

06:49.647 --> 06:50.546
"Cats."

06:50.648 --> 06:52.715
No. That's not it.

06:52.817 --> 06:54.851
It'll come to me.

06:54.919 --> 06:56.252
The point is, that was the night

06:56.321 --> 06:58.121
my love for musical theater was born.

06:58.223 --> 07:00.556
That's it! If I can get
my dad to see "Joseph,"

07:00.625 --> 07:02.758
then he'll turn into a theater
geek and finally get me!

07:02.827 --> 07:05.928
All it took for me was
seeing one dancing cat show.

07:05.997 --> 07:07.763
I think it was called "Pets."

07:07.866 --> 07:09.332
"Cats"! It's called "Cats"!

07:09.434 --> 07:11.701
All right, smarty pants!
Drop and give me 20!

07:11.803 --> 07:12.702
20 what?

07:12.770 --> 07:14.403
Monologues. Stage laps.

07:14.472 --> 07:17.039
No, wait! Vocal tongue
twisters! Move it!

07:17.108 --> 07:20.176
Mommy made me mash my M&Ms.
Mommy made me mash my M&Ms.

07:20.245 --> 07:21.377
Mommy made me mash my M&Ms.

07:21.446 --> 07:22.912
<i>As my theater dreams crumbled,</i>

07:22.981 --> 07:25.381
<i>my mom and the Frentas were
standing strong against Barry.</i>

07:25.483 --> 07:26.949
Aw, Bar?

07:27.018 --> 07:29.852
The moms are back, and this time
they have Donkey Kong hammers.

07:29.921 --> 07:32.155
Mom, today's the JTP Bowl!

07:32.257 --> 07:33.823
Go play your lady golf somewhere else.

07:33.892 --> 07:36.359
<i>And so the great
Goldberg turf war began,</i>

07:36.427 --> 07:38.361
<i>and only one gang of friends
would be left standing.</i>

07:39.631 --> 07:43.032
Sorry, Pickle. Your end
zone is now our brunch zone.

07:43.101 --> 07:45.501
Fine. Then we'll all go
play at Naked Rob's house.

07:45.603 --> 07:47.236
<i>His awesome mother always greets us</i>

07:47.305 --> 07:49.505
with Ecto Coolers, Pringles, and hugs.

07:49.574 --> 07:51.507
<i>Once again, Barry used
his latest technique</i>

07:51.576 --> 07:53.943
<i>of emotional manipulation
to trap my mom.</i>

07:54.012 --> 07:56.579
<i>But for the first time ever,
she didn't take the bait.</i>

07:56.681 --> 07:58.614
You were cutting it close there.

07:58.683 --> 08:00.550
We were about to head
over to Mrs. Naked's house.

08:00.618 --> 08:02.185
Say "hi" to the Nakeds for me.

08:02.253 --> 08:04.086
But, you're supposed to beg me to stay

08:04.189 --> 08:06.222
and try to match or beat
the snack offer of Pringles.

08:06.291 --> 08:08.824
Well, my friends made me
realize you've been playing me.

08:08.927 --> 08:09.926
<i>Well, you know what I think?</i>

08:10.028 --> 08:12.528
Those "friends" of yours
are a bad influence!

08:12.630 --> 08:13.996
Please! You don't even know 'em!

08:14.098 --> 08:16.257
Believe me, I've lived a long time.

08:16.359 --> 08:18.192
I know a bad apple when I see one!

08:18.294 --> 08:20.695
Pfft! I can be friends
with whoever I want!

08:20.797 --> 08:22.730
Don't you walk away
from me, Young Lady Mom!

08:22.832 --> 08:25.499
♪

08:25.602 --> 08:27.335
Okay, I'm putting my foot down.

08:27.437 --> 08:29.937
<i>This is our yard, so please go!</i>

08:30.039 --> 08:31.739
<i>Your yard? Oh, no, honey.</i>

08:31.808 --> 08:33.573
<i>This yard belongs to us now.</i>

08:33.643 --> 08:35.943
Let's make one thing clear.

08:36.044 --> 08:38.246
This turf belongs to the JTP.

08:38.347 --> 08:39.280
JTP!

08:39.349 --> 08:40.914
<i>Only turf I see belongs to us.</i>

08:41.017 --> 08:42.683
- Ain't that right, Frentas?
- Frentas!

08:42.751 --> 08:44.217
Oh, no. They did a call-and-response.

08:44.287 --> 08:45.286
Took us years to get there.

08:45.355 --> 08:46.487
Here's an idea.

08:46.556 --> 08:49.323
Why don't you run inside
and fix Essie a fresh mamose.

08:49.425 --> 08:50.725
You hear that, JTP?

08:50.793 --> 08:53.694
<i>They think we work for them!</i>

09:00.870 --> 09:03.838
No, bro. It's two parts
O.J. to one part champagne.

09:03.906 --> 09:05.873
Okay, everyone stop!

09:05.942 --> 09:06.974
What is going on right now?

09:07.076 --> 09:08.776
Seems like your mom
turned the tables on you

09:08.878 --> 09:10.544
'cause her friends
helped her learn and grow.

09:10.613 --> 09:13.147
Well, then, we must seek
guidance from the only person

09:13.216 --> 09:15.249
who knows how to outsmart
Beverly Goldberg...

09:15.318 --> 09:17.985
My sister, Erica.

09:18.087 --> 09:19.820
No.

09:19.889 --> 09:21.989
So... no Erica? At all?

09:22.091 --> 09:23.324
That is all we're gonna get.

09:23.393 --> 09:25.226
Aw. But I was really looking
forward to seeing her this week.

09:25.295 --> 09:27.128
Well, if you think about
it, she's off at college,

09:27.230 --> 09:28.362
so it really makes no sense

09:28.431 --> 09:30.398
why she'd be involved in any of this.

09:30.500 --> 09:31.399
So, now what?

09:31.501 --> 09:33.334
Now we take our yard back.

09:33.436 --> 09:36.237
We're in a real-life turf war, JTP,

09:36.339 --> 09:38.639
two rival gangs going head-to-head,

09:38.741 --> 09:40.207
just like in that movie "Colors."

09:40.310 --> 09:42.143
<i>I don't think this
is anything like that.</i>

09:42.245 --> 09:44.312
We were there first, and they
came and took our backyard.

09:44.414 --> 09:45.579
What's different?

09:45.682 --> 09:47.948
"Colors" is an incredibly
real and poignant movie

09:48.051 --> 09:49.550
about socioeconomic factors

09:49.652 --> 09:51.185
that created a political
tinderbox within...

09:51.287 --> 09:52.620
Now you get it!

09:52.722 --> 09:54.855
We're in a real-life war, just
like in that movie "Colors."

09:54.957 --> 09:57.158
Guys, we live in the
suburbs of Jenkintown.

09:57.260 --> 09:58.559
It's super offensive to compare our...

09:58.661 --> 10:01.429
Bro, just get on board.
He's not letting this one go.

10:02.832 --> 10:04.765
Fine. We're in a turf war.

10:04.867 --> 10:05.833
- "Colors"!
- "Colors"!

10:05.935 --> 10:06.834
- "Colors"!
- "Colors"!

10:06.936 --> 10:08.469
"Colors," I guess.

10:10.658 --> 10:13.172
<i>I was on a mission to
make my dad a theater geek.</i>

10:13.337 --> 10:14.772
<i>But there was only one way to get him</i>

10:15.095 --> 10:16.962
<i>to actually watch a musical... lie!</i>

10:17.064 --> 10:18.764
Dad, I have amazing news!

10:18.866 --> 10:21.133
You say that a lot,
but it never pans out.

10:21.201 --> 10:23.135
Oh. Then I guess I can't
interest you in these...

10:23.203 --> 10:24.603
hockey sport tickets!

10:24.671 --> 10:26.638
Wait. You got us Flyers tickets?

10:26.740 --> 10:28.874
It does say that on
the envelope, so yes.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.208
The two of us together?

10:30.310 --> 10:32.177
Listen, I'm always pushing
you to understand my stuff,

10:32.246 --> 10:33.712
so, for once, I thought
it'd be cool for you...

10:33.814 --> 10:34.646
Whoa!

10:34.715 --> 10:36.348
Thank you. This means everything.

10:36.417 --> 10:38.150
- Oh, boy.
- All my life,

10:38.218 --> 10:40.552
the only way I knew how to
connect with other people

10:40.621 --> 10:41.820
was through sports.

10:41.889 --> 10:43.288
A hug. That's unexpected.

10:43.357 --> 10:45.157
And when I realized
you had no interest...

10:45.259 --> 10:46.525
This is a really long hug.

10:46.593 --> 10:48.293
I just didn't know how to get close.

10:48.395 --> 10:49.628
But now I can!

10:49.696 --> 10:52.063
<i>The important thing is, I
bought us tickets to something.</i>

10:52.132 --> 10:53.298
Doesn't matter what.

10:53.400 --> 10:55.734
You know, once you discover
the magic of hockey,

10:55.836 --> 10:57.302
then you'll see what I see,

10:57.404 --> 10:59.004
and you'll become a true puck head.

10:59.106 --> 11:00.605
Kind of like how seeing a musical

11:00.707 --> 11:01.907
could turn you into a theater geek?

11:03.177 --> 11:04.776
You know, normally, I
don't get your jokes,

11:04.845 --> 11:06.178
but it's already working!

11:06.246 --> 11:10.115
Oh-oh-oh, man. I am so looking
forward to this hockey game.

11:10.217 --> 11:11.249
Me too!

11:11.318 --> 11:12.551
Mmmmmwah!

11:12.619 --> 11:15.086
This is a really long hug.

11:15.189 --> 11:16.488
Coach!

11:16.557 --> 11:18.957
My plan backfired, and now if I
don't take my dad to the Flyers,

11:19.059 --> 11:19.958
I'll break his heart!

11:20.027 --> 11:21.126
I'm on my shake break.

11:21.195 --> 11:22.661
Don't you have any other
friends you can talk to?

11:22.763 --> 11:24.162
They're all in "Joseph."

11:24.231 --> 11:26.097
Please help me find sports tickets.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.699
What's the TKTS of hockey?

11:27.768 --> 11:29.167
All right, I'm gonna help you out here.

11:29.269 --> 11:30.769
I share season tickets to the Flyers

11:30.838 --> 11:32.270
with 16 other gym teachers.

11:32.372 --> 11:33.505
You'd do that for me?

11:33.574 --> 11:36.174
No. I'd do it for my
lady love, Ms. Cinoman.

11:36.276 --> 11:37.676
This musical is her creative vision,

11:37.778 --> 11:38.743
and I got to support it.

11:38.846 --> 11:40.312
All she did was send in a tape.

11:40.380 --> 11:44.616
I think you and I both know
she's the heart of this show.

11:47.421 --> 11:50.922
So much egg, beets thick.

It's now or never, boys.

11:57.664 --> 11:59.364
We're not just at war for our turf,

11:59.466 --> 12:00.866
we're at war for our honor.

12:00.968 --> 12:02.734
Again, there is no war...

12:02.803 --> 12:04.436
Just a minor disagreement
with your mother.

12:04.538 --> 12:07.072

That's Tim Kerr, left wing.

Now I know why Barry never takes off

14:12.199 --> 14:13.632
this dumb Flyers shirt.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.368
It's like I'm part of the team,

We just learned something incredible.

14:27.581 --> 14:29.414
I tried your thing, which
I thought I would hate,

14:29.483 --> 14:31.016
- but I loved it!
- That's true.

14:31.084 --> 14:32.250
Think about it like this.

14:32.352 --> 14:34.285
How did you feel when Dave
Brown was sent to the box

14:34.388 --> 14:36.488
for cross- checking when we
already had the power play?

14:36.590 --> 14:37.956
I was on the edge of my seat.

14:38.058 --> 14:41.026
And that's how you'll feel when
Potifar unfairly jails Joseph.

14:41.094 --> 14:44.162
I can't believe that analogy
completely makes sense to me.

14:44.264 --> 14:46.765
'Cause I love hockey.
We can communicate now.

14:46.833 --> 14:47.832
See how important this is?

14:47.934 --> 14:49.334
Okay! I'll go see the thing.

14:49.436 --> 14:51.202
- To the theater!
- I'm gonna give you a hug!

14:51.271 --> 14:52.837
I'm gonna let ya!

14:52.906 --> 14:55.073
Okay, JTP.

14:55.142 --> 14:58.243
Today, we face a rival gang the
likes of which we've never seen.

14:58.345 --> 15:00.879
They're crafty, they're
pushy, they're old.

15:00.947 --> 15:01.846
What do we do?

15:01.948 --> 15:03.014
I got it!

15:03.083 --> 15:04.249
Moms love laundry, right?

15:04.351 --> 15:05.583
So we bring in a basket of clothes

15:05.686 --> 15:07.419
and have them fight
over who gets to fold it.

15:07.487 --> 15:09.454
Or we tell them
the floor's dirty,

15:09.523 --> 15:12.157
watch them scrap over who gets
to mop it to a brilliant shine.

15:12.259 --> 15:15.994
<i>Or we say only one of
them has the privilege</i>

15:16.063 --> 15:18.863
of making us an afternoon snack,
and then we watch them fight.

15:18.965 --> 15:20.165
Um, guys?

15:20.267 --> 15:22.000
Your plan is predicated on the idea

15:22.102 --> 15:24.035
that these moms love
cooking and cleaning,

15:24.137 --> 15:25.537
and I don't think they do.

15:25.639 --> 15:27.238
Buzzkill Bradley strikes again.

15:27.307 --> 15:28.940
What does "predicated"
even mean? You suck!

15:29.009 --> 15:31.668
All right, fine. Just do...
Just do the laundry thing!

15:33.205 --> 15:34.838
You realize those boys
are upstairs right now,

15:34.940 --> 15:35.839
plotting against us?

15:35.907 --> 15:37.974
Let them try. We're inseparable.

15:38.043 --> 15:40.643
I am so glad that you finally
stood up for yourself, Beverly.

15:40.712 --> 15:42.312
Oh, well, that's all thanks to you guys.

15:42.414 --> 15:44.080
<i>No! You deserve the credit</i>

15:44.182 --> 15:46.015
for putting that bratty
little jerk in his place.

15:46.118 --> 15:48.118
Whoa! Okay.

15:48.220 --> 15:49.386
Let's not go crazy.

15:49.488 --> 15:51.221
Essie's right... Barry can act like

15:51.323 --> 15:52.889
a bit of a poop head sometimes.

15:52.991 --> 15:56.025
My child's head is not
made of poop, Ginzy.

15:56.128 --> 15:58.728
I mean, do you ever hear me
call your son a dirty man-tramp?

15:58.830 --> 16:00.163
'Cause he so is one.

16:00.265 --> 16:02.265
How dare you. Drew is a gentleman.

16:02.367 --> 16:03.700
Girls, stop. Let's just agree

16:03.769 --> 16:05.635
that both of your sons are meh at best.

16:05.737 --> 16:08.371
Oh, please, Linda. Your precious
little Geoffy is part of this, too.

16:08.440 --> 16:11.516
Well, that's just Barry's bad influence.

16:11.551 --> 16:13.843
<i>And so they all broke the
cardinal rule of Frentaship,</i>

16:13.945 --> 16:16.212
<i>never rip on someone else's child.</i>

16:16.314 --> 16:19.015
Baaad news, ladies!

16:19.117 --> 16:20.917
We got a lot of laundry,

16:21.019 --> 16:22.919
and only one of you gets to fold it.

16:23.021 --> 16:24.053
I'm sorry.

16:24.156 --> 16:25.989
No, that's fine, Barry.
They were just leaving.

16:26.091 --> 16:27.257
- Fine by me.
- Perfect!

16:27.359 --> 16:28.625
These bubbles are mine!

16:30.595 --> 16:32.295
What just happened?

16:32.397 --> 16:36.266
I can't have people in my
life who disrespect my kids.

16:36.368 --> 16:38.468
The yard's all yours.
Have fun with your friends.

16:39.805 --> 16:42.272
Does anyone else feel
really bad right now?

16:42.374 --> 16:43.807
- Yeah.
- I do.

16:43.909 --> 16:46.376
Doesn't feel so good to win a turf war.

16:46.478 --> 16:47.710
Colors.

16:47.813 --> 16:48.878
Colors.

16:50.081 --> 16:51.514
It's really nothing like it.

16:53.051 --> 16:56.256
You've got to shut up. It's not...

16:56.401 --> 16:58.472
<i>Now that I shared my
dad's love of hockey,</i>

16:58.655 --> 17:00.652
<i>it was time for him to fall in love</i>

17:00.704 --> 17:02.737
<i>with the glory that is musical theater.</i>

17:02.806 --> 17:05.272
Man, I am so jealous
of you right now,

17:05.342 --> 17:06.741
your first musical.

17:06.843 --> 17:08.042
There's nothing like it.

17:08.111 --> 17:10.945
You know what? I think
this won't be so bad.

17:11.013 --> 17:12.079
<i>With that,</i>

17:12.148 --> 17:13.815
<i>Andrew Lloyd Webber's opus began,</i>

17:13.884 --> 17:16.017
<i>and my dad was totally digging it...</i>

17:16.086 --> 17:17.452
<i>for about 10 seconds.</i>

17:17.554 --> 17:19.054
<i>After that, he was squirming.</i>

17:19.122 --> 17:21.690
These seats are so small.
It's worse than an airplane.

17:21.758 --> 17:23.525
<i>And he was hungry.</i>

17:26.997 --> 17:27.996
Let me do it.

17:28.065 --> 17:30.465
<i>And finally, he was sleepy.</i>

17:30.534 --> 17:33.034
<i>Very, very...</i>

17:33.103 --> 17:34.936
<i>incredibly sleepy.</i>

17:36.073 --> 17:37.872
Dad! Wake up! It's the curtain call!

17:37.975 --> 17:40.609
Ah. Great. Let's go.

17:42.879 --> 17:44.079
Never again.

17:44.181 --> 17:45.413
That was so boring!

17:45.482 --> 17:47.749
I've never felt such
exhaustion in my life.

17:47.851 --> 17:48.984
Exhaustion?!

17:49.052 --> 17:50.251
You slept through half the show

17:50.354 --> 17:51.987
and missed all the best Pharaoh songs!

17:52.055 --> 17:53.622
That's another thing...
What's with all the singing?

17:53.690 --> 17:55.090
It's a musical!

17:55.158 --> 17:56.725
Who sings that much? Who does that?

17:56.793 --> 17:58.593
<i>Just think. There had to
be something that you liked.</i>

17:58.662 --> 18:00.595
Yeah, that part in the middle
where I thought it was over.

18:00.697 --> 18:01.930
The intermission?!

18:02.032 --> 18:03.665
What do you want from me?!

18:03.767 --> 18:05.300
I don't get theater, Adam.

18:05.402 --> 18:07.435
<i>Then you don't get me.</i>

18:07.537 --> 18:09.404
<i>So, theater wasn't my dad's thing.</i>

18:09.473 --> 18:11.773
<i>But seeing me so hurt
made him do something</i>

18:11.842 --> 18:13.541
<i>I never thought was possible.</i>

18:13.610 --> 18:16.745
Class, a very angry
parent has informed me

18:16.813 --> 18:20.682
that some of you felt excluded
from the "Joseph" tour.

18:20.751 --> 18:25.020
So, to make it right, I hereby
change the school musical

18:25.122 --> 18:26.721
to "Joseph" instead of "Cats."

18:27.991 --> 18:29.457
"Cats"! That's the title!

18:29.559 --> 18:31.726
My coat of many colors, please.

18:31.795 --> 18:33.228
