Damn. Because I brought
chocolates and a Lifetime movie.

was best for me --

18:24.938 --> 18:26.804

You did this for<i> us?</i>

18:30.777 --> 18:32.276
We're okay with the kid.

18:32.278 --> 18:34.879
I think your mom's actually
gonna invite him over to brunch,

18:34.881 --> 18:38.249
now that she knows she doesn't
have to share her booze.

18:38.251 --> 18:41.085
I just knew you guys would never
be comfortable with it, you know?

18:41.087 --> 18:42.553
Every time we'd be
10 minutes late for something,

18:42.555 --> 18:45.056
you'd be calling the morgue.

18:45.058 --> 18:46.557
The only time
I ever call the morgue

18:46.559 --> 18:49.160
is to have them page Izzie Bleeding.

I'm an awesome daughter.

No, no, no.

[ Mockingly ]
"Yes, I did."

as when you said,

"I-I don't have a snake."

All right, fine, yes.
[ Sighs ]

19:23.129 --> 19:24.295
I didn't break up with Rob.

19:24.297 --> 19:26.631
I only told Mom that
so you guys wouldn't worry.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.300
And you knew he was getting
sober before I asked you?

19:29.302 --> 19:31.469
Yes, but what I didn't know
was that he told you,

19:31.471 --> 19:32.770
and now
all you know about Rob

19:32.772 --> 19:34.639
is that he's an alcoholic
and a Raider fan.

19:34.641 --> 19:35.940
I mean,
if he becomes a Democrat,

19:35.942 --> 19:39.043
he'll complete
the Mike Baxter trinity of evil.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.547
He's not gonna become a Democrat
now that he stopped drinking.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.115
I just wish
you'd gotten to know him

19:44.117 --> 19:46.551
before he told you,
you know?

19:46.553 --> 19:49.487
There's two things I know
about this kid, all right?

19:49.489 --> 19:51.322
He's brave
and he's honest.

19:51.324 --> 19:52.523
He comes over to my house,

19:52.525 --> 19:54.625

he tells me is<i> this?</i>

19:54.627 --> 19:55.993
Mm.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.696
For a guy who doesn't drink,
he<i> is</i> pretty chatty.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.667
Listen, I have a lot of people
in my life in recovery,

20:02.669 --> 20:05.236
and those that make it
share two things in common --

20:05.238 --> 20:08.372
They're brave
and they're honest.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.808
I know
he's gonna make it, Dad.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.410
He<i> might</i> make it.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.679
But you got to understand this,
honey -- only<i> he</i> can stay sober.

20:14.681 --> 20:16.981
This is not
about you helping him.

20:16.983 --> 20:18.983

all the time.

she'd asked you to help.
