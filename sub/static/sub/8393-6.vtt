07:19.260 --> 07:23.264
AND I

07:23.370 --> 07:26.259
CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE MINE

07:29.890 --> 07:33.337
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MINE

07:34.900 --> 07:37.755
CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MINE

07:42.080 --> 07:42.648
- ALL RIGHT, LOOKS
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE ALL SET.

07:42.770 --> 07:45.000
SO THIS IS YOUR COPY.

07:45.110 --> 07:46.520
JUST TAKE IT HOME
AND MAKE SURE ALL,

07:46.630 --> 07:47.949
LIKE, THE BILLING STUFF
AND THE ADDRESS STUFF

07:48.050 --> 07:49.324
IS RIGHT, ALL RIGHT?

07:49.430 --> 07:51.113
COOL.
ALL RIGHT, TAKE IT EASY.

07:58.130 --> 07:59.119
- HEY.

07:59.230 --> 08:00.436
- HI.
- DO YOU REMEMBER ME?

08:00.540 --> 08:02.405
- [laughs] YES.
MY—-MY GRANDPA'S FRIEND.

08:02.510 --> 08:05.331
- RIGHT.
RYAN.

08:05.450 --> 08:06.826
- RYAN, HI. AMBER.

08:06.930 --> 08:10.411
- UH, SO, THIS IS, UH--

08:10.520 --> 08:12.681
- YEAH.

08:12.800 --> 08:14.347
AS NIFI'Y AS ZEEK
SAID IT WAS.

08:14.450 --> 08:16.270
- NIFI'Y.
THAT'S HIS FAVORITE.

08:16.390 --> 08:17.869
- "YOU SHOULD GO BY AND SEE
WHERE MY GRANDDAUGHTER WORKS.

08:17.980 --> 08:18.901
A REAL NIFI'Y OUTFIT
THEY GOT GOIN' ON."

08:19.010 --> 08:21.592
- [laughs] WELL,
IT IS A NIFTY OUTFIT.

08:21.700 --> 08:24.908
UH, WELL, COOL.
UM--

08:25.020 --> 08:27.773
ARE YOU INTERESTED
IN MUSIC?

08:27.880 --> 08:31.919
UH, I'M INTERESTED
IN YOU.

08:32.020 --> 08:33.601
- OH.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.608
THAT'S VERY DIRECT.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.119
IS THAT,
LIKE, A SOLDIER THING?

08:37.240 --> 08:39.504
- UH, NO.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.269
I'M INCREDIBLY NERVOUS,
AND IF I DON'T

08:41.380 --> 08:43.473
JUST COWBOY UP,
THEN I'M GONNA LOSE MY NERVE,

08:43.590 --> 08:45.729
SO, UH--

08:45.830 --> 08:49.652
WOULD YOU GO OUT
WITH ME SOMETIME?

08:51.460 --> 08:53.769
- YEAH.
I GUESS.

08:53.870 --> 08:56.805
- NIFTY.
[laughter]

09:01.540 --> 09:03.428
[knocks at door]

09:03.540 --> 09:05.679
- HEY, BUD.

09:07.580 --> 09:11.744
WHAT YA DOIN'?

09:11.860 --> 09:13.999
SO I JUST--I WANTED TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT TOMORROW.

09:14.100 --> 09:16.682
UM, DAD AND
I ARE SO INCREDIBLY BUMMED

09:16.790 --> 09:18.758
THAT WE'RE GONNA
MISS YOUR SPEECH.

09:18.860 --> 09:19.588
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.
- IT'S OKAY.

09:19.690 --> 09:22.932
YOU COULDN'T VOTE ANYWAY.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.268
- THAT'S TRUE.
WE CAN'T VOTE,

09:24.390 --> 09:26.836
BUT I REALLY WANTED TO BE THERE
TO SUPPORT YOU.

09:26.940 --> 09:28.862
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU
WANT TO SAY TO THE KIDS?

09:28.980 --> 09:32.598
DO YOU HAVE YOUR NOTE CARDS
ALL DONE?

09:32.710 --> 09:35.497
THINGS LIKE THAT?
WHAT YOU WANNA GET ACROSS...

09:35.600 --> 09:37.044
- YEP.
- TO THE STUDENT BODY?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.252
GREAT.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.429
WELL, IF YOU WANT,
I MEAN, I'D LOVE TO HEAR IT.

09:40.540 --> 09:41.916
I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IT.
I COULD GIVE YOU

09:42.020 --> 09:43.783
SOME POSITIVE FEEDBACK,
OR I CAN JUST READ IT MYSELF.

09:43.890 --> 09:45.926
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO RECITE IT TO ME

09:46.030 --> 09:48.169
IN CASE YOU GET NERVOUS--
- IT'S NOT WRITTEN DOWN.

09:48.270 --> 09:50.374
IT'S IN MY HEAD.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.415
IT'S A SPEECH.
- WHAT'S IN YOUR--

09:53.520 --> 09:55.033
YOU DID--[clears throat]
NOTHING'S--

09:55.140 --> 09:57.062
- YOU DIDN'T
WRITE ANYTHING DOWN AT ALL?

09:57.180 --> 09:58.693
- NOPE.
- MAX?

09:58.800 --> 10:00.552
- [tapping pencil on pad]

10:00.660 --> 10:01.456
- OKAY.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.937
HEY, BUDDY,

10:04.050 --> 10:06.837
SOMETIMES, WHEN YOU
GET UP THERE,

10:06.950 --> 10:08.872
YOU THINK YOU HAVE IT
IN YOUR HEAD,

10:08.980 --> 10:11.676
AND I KNOW THIS
FROM EXPERIENCE.

10:11.780 --> 10:13.941
YOU GET A LITTLE FLUSTERED,
AND YOU SEE THE CROWD,

10:14.060 --> 10:15.049
AND YOU MAY
GET A LITTLE NERVOUS.

10:15.160 --> 10:17.469
AND PEOPLE ARE NOISY
AND VERY RUDE.

10:17.580 --> 10:20.026
THEY DON'T GIVE YOU THE COURTESY
OF GE'I'I'ING YOUR POINT ACROSS.

10:20.130 --> 10:24.510
SO I THINK MAYBE YOU SHOULD
WRITE IT DOWN.

10:24.620 --> 10:26.895
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY?

10:27.000 --> 10:29.685
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
MY SPEECH ANYMORE.

10:29.800 --> 10:31.176
- WILL YOU WRITE DOWN
YOUR NOTES?

10:31.280 --> 10:33.999
I CAN HELP YOU WRITE THEM.
I WROTE FOR BOB LITTLE.

10:34.110 --> 10:35.247
- HE DIDN'T WIN.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.839
- NO, HE DIDN'T.

10:41.950 --> 10:43.838
- THIS'LL BE NICE,
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:43.950 --> 10:45.258
WE GOT SOME MORE STUFF
CLEARED OUT,

10:45.360 --> 10:49.251
AND IT'S A LITTLE BIGGER
THAN YOUR ROOM AT GRANDMA'S.

10:49.370 --> 10:50.746
- YEAH.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.192
- DO YOU NEED HELP UNPACKING?

10:52.300 --> 10:53.403
WE HAVE ONE DRESSER HERE.

10:53.510 --> 10:54.431
- NO, I'M NOT UNPACKING.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.676
I'M JUST LOOKING
FOR A SWEATSHIRT.

10:55.790 --> 10:57.018
I WAS GONNA GO OUT.

10:57.130 --> 10:59.439
- OKAY.

10:59.550 --> 11:02.030
UH, IT'S OUR
FIRST NIGHT HERE,

11:02.140 --> 11:03.755
AND WE WERE SEE; OF THINKING...

11:03.870 --> 11:05.030
- WE'D ALL HANG OUT.

11:05.140 --> 11:06.243
- HOW'S IT ALL GOING?
- GOOD.

11:06.350 --> 11:07.248
- IT'S FINE.

11:07.350 --> 11:09.454
- I CLEANED OUT A DRAWER
IN THE BATHROOM

11:09.560 --> 11:11.039
SO THAT CAN BE YOURS,
AND--

11:11.150 --> 11:13.038
- WE EACH HAVE A DRAWER.
- THAT'S FINE.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.139
I'LL JUST KEEP IT
ALL IN HERE.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.047
- AND ALSO,
I FOUND THE DRILL.

11:16.150 --> 11:17.947
SO IF YOU NEED HELP HANGING
ANYTHING--

11:18.050 --> 11:19.017
- GREAT--OR TAKING
ANYTHING DOWN,

11:19.120 --> 11:20.940
LIKE THE GAS CHART.
- OH, YEAH.

11:21.050 --> 11:23.189
YOU DON'T NEED THAT
GERMAN GAS POSTER.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.699
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
IF YOU LIKE IT,

11:24.820 --> 11:25.741
THAT'S--THAT CAN STAY.

11:25.850 --> 11:28.330
- MOM, CAN I BORROW THE CAR?

11:28.440 --> 11:29.475
- HONEY,
IT'S OUR FIRST NIGHT.

11:29.580 --> 11:30.615
WE WERE GONNA
ORDER SOME FOOD AND,

11:30.720 --> 11:31.926
YOU KNOW, BE TOGETHER.

11:32.030 --> 11:34.476
- I ALREADY
MADE PLANS, LIKE--

11:34.590 --> 11:35.784
- OKAY.

11:35.900 --> 11:37.208
- DO YOU WANT TO EAT
BEFORE WE--

11:37.310 --> 11:38.925
WE GO, OR--
- NO, WE'RE GOING TO EAT.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.656
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE CAR.

11:41.770 --> 11:42.509
I'LL JUST GET SOMEONE
TO PICK ME UP.

11:42.630 --> 11:44.939
- HEY...

11:45.040 --> 11:47.383
DREW...

11:47.490 --> 11:49.663
DREW.

11:49.770 --> 11:51.328
- WHAT, MOM?
- DREW!

11:51.430 --> 11:52.499
[door slams]

11:52.600 --> 11:54.249
- SOMEONE CAN DRIVE ME.
IT'S FINE.

11:54.360 --> 11:55.292
- HONEY, I'M SORRY IF THIS
DOESN'T FEEL GOOD TO YOU.

11:55.400 --> 11:57.743
IT'S JUST NEW, YOU KNOW?
YOU'LL--IT'LL--

11:57.850 --> 11:59.636
- YEAH.
- MARK LOVES YOU.

11:59.750 --> 12:00.671
AND--AND--
- ALL RIGHT, I MEAN,

12:00.780 --> 12:02.509
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH MARK.

12:02.610 --> 12:04.749
HE'S GREAT.
HE'S SUPER NICE.

12:04.860 --> 12:07.499
IT'S JUST--LIKE, YOU PICK UP
AND MOVE ME

12:07.620 --> 12:08.894
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY SENIOR YEAR,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.683
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
BE MOVING AGAIN SOON.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.826
AND, IT JUST SUCKS.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.932
NOW I LIVE WITH MR. CYR,
LIKE A TEACHER.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.268
- HE'S NOT MR. CYR.
HE'S GONNA BE YOUR STEPFATHER.

12:16.390 --> 12:19.382
AND THIS WAY, WHEN YOU COME
BACK FROM COLLEGE,

12:19.490 --> 12:21.799
THIS WILL ALREADY
FEEL LIKE HOME, YOU KNOW?

12:21.910 --> 12:23.764
- OKAY, YOU DIDN'T
THINK ABOUT THAT

12:23.880 --> 12:24.972
WHEN YOU FIRST MADE
THIS DECISION, YOU KNOW.

12:25.080 --> 12:26.593
- YES, I DID.
- NOW YOU'RE PIECING IT TOGETHER

12:26.710 --> 12:27.938
BUT--
- I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE HAPPY.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.847
YOU KNOW?
- NO, YOU LITERALLY

12:29.950 --> 12:31.394
MADE THE DECISION AND TOLD ME
THAT I'M MOVING.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.081
LIKE, YOU DIDN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT ME AT ALL.

12:44.380 --> 12:46.109
- HEY, LISTEN, I SPOKE
TO ADAM THIS MORNING,

12:46.210 --> 12:46.995
AND HE SAID THAT HE'D PREFER
NOT TO HAVE A BIG CROWD

12:47.110 --> 12:48.418
IN THE WAITING ROOM
TOMORROW.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.557
SO I'VE MADE UP
A SCHEDULE FOR ALL OF US.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.104
WHERE ARE YOU?

12:53.220 --> 12:56.451
- UH, I AM AT THE DOG PARK
BEING SUPER HELPFUL

12:56.560 --> 12:57.731
AND WALKING OTIS.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.660
I'M ALSO PICKING UP
SOME PRE-SURGERY DINNER.

12:59.770 --> 13:01.328
- GOOD FOR YOU.

13:01.430 --> 13:03.773
OKAY, SO DO YOU WANT
THE 6:00 TO 8:00 A.M. SHIFT,

13:03.880 --> 13:05.916
THE 8:00 TO 10:00 A.M.,
OR THE 10:00 TO NOON?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.089
AFTER 12:00, THE ROTATION
STARTS OVER.

13:07.200 --> 13:10.533
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
TWO-HOUR SHIFTS?

13:10.650 --> 13:11.571
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.056
- WELL, IT'S WHAT ADAM WANTS.

13:13.170 --> 13:14.717
SO WHICH ONE
DO YOU WANT?

13:14.820 --> 13:15.957
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
THIS IS CRAP.

13:16.070 --> 13:17.230
I'M JUST GONNA BE THERE
THE ENTIRE TIME

13:17.340 --> 13:18.614
AND THEY'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

13:18.720 --> 13:20.062
- CROSBY, THAT'S REALLY
SWEET OF YOU,

13:20.170 --> 13:21.239
BUT THAT JUST MEANS
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

13:21.350 --> 13:22.510
WHICHEVER ONE
SARAH DOESN'T WANT,

13:22.620 --> 13:24.201
SO LET ME
CONFERENCE HER IN.

13:24.320 --> 13:26.834
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT
FROM HOME, I DON'T THINK.

13:26.940 --> 13:27.588
- WHAT?

13:27.700 --> 13:30.043
NO--WHOA! WHOA!

13:30.150 --> 13:32.243
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
[dog yelps]

13:32.360 --> 13:34.078
[static]

13:39.740 --> 13:41.128
- HEY.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.152
DO YOU NEED HELP WITH SOMETHING?
- HEY, UM--

13:43.270 --> 13:46.125
YEAH.
HOW DOES THIS WORK, EXACTLY?

13:46.230 --> 13:48.437
- OH! I DON'T--
I DON'T HAVE CABLE.

13:48.550 --> 13:50.757
- WHAT?

13:50.860 --> 13:52.589
_ UH--
- FOR REAL?

13:52.690 --> 13:53.964
- YEAH.
HEH, YEAH.

13:54.070 --> 13:56.209
I KNOW, IT'S SUPER LAME.
I HAD IT FOR A LITTLE WHILE,

13:56.310 --> 13:58.175
BUT I WASN'T READING
ANY OF MY BOOKS,

13:58.280 --> 13:59.486
AND I WAS WATCHING
A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOTHING.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.410
SO I FELT LIKE I WAS
BETTER OFF WITHOUT IT.

14:01.530 --> 14:05.114
BUT I DO HAVE A DVD PLAYER.
UH, IF YOU WANT, I--

14:05.220 --> 14:07.563
- IT'S FINE, I CAN JUST,
YOU KNOW, READ A BOOK,

14:07.670 --> 14:08.568
LIKE YOU SAID.

14:08.670 --> 14:12.390
- HEY, UM--

14:12.500 --> 14:15.060
IF--IF THERE'S ANYTHING
I CAN DO TO--

14:15.160 --> 14:17.367
TO HELP MAKE YOU
MORE COMFORTABLE.

14:17.470 --> 14:18.698
IF YOU NEED SOMETHING
FOR YOUR ROOM,

14:18.820 --> 14:21.436
OR IF YOU JUST
WANT SOME MORE PRIVACY.

14:21.550 --> 14:25.065
- YEAH, PRIVACY'S
PROBABLY GOOD, SO--

14:25.170 --> 14:27.229
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT, COOL.

14:27.340 --> 14:28.307
- ALL RIGHT.

14:37.420 --> 14:38.899
- HEY. UH...

14:39.010 --> 14:40.113
- HEY.
- CROSBY CALLED.

14:40.220 --> 14:42.905
APPARENTLY THERE
WAS SOME INCIDENT WITH OTIS.

14:43.020 --> 14:45.011
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
AN INCIDENT WITH OTIS?

14:45.120 --> 14:46.530
WHAT HAPPENED?
- I'M SURE HE'S FINE, HONEY.

14:46.640 --> 14:48.323
CROSBY SAID HE WAS GONNA
"TOTES HANDLE IT,"

14:48.430 --> 14:49.294
UH, BUT...
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

14:49.400 --> 14:50.606
- DINNER MIGHT BE
A LITTLE LATE.

14:50.710 --> 14:51.916
- "TOTES HANDLE IT."
WAIT--THIS--OKAY, OVER HERE.

14:52.020 --> 14:53.988
WHAT DO YOU THINK SO FAR?

14:54.100 --> 14:54.987
- I THINK IT LOOKS GREAT.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.055
- GOOD, I HAVEN'T USED THIS--

14:56.170 --> 14:57.546
- YOU LOOK REALLY PRETTY.

14:57.650 --> 14:58.856
YOU'RE USING THE GOOD PLATES.
- THANK YOU.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.928
YEAH, AND I'M USING
THE GOOD SILVERWARE

15:01.030 --> 15:02.133
WE HAVEN'T USED IN AGES,

15:02.240 --> 15:03.719
SO I THOUGHT I MIGHT AS WELL
PULL IT OUT

15:03.830 --> 15:04.854
AND, YOU KNOW,
HAVE SOME FUN WITH IT.

15:04.970 --> 15:06.176
SORT OF SEIZE THE MOMENT.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.099
- CAN I GIVE YOU A HAND
WITH THOSE NAPKINS?

15:07.210 --> 15:08.279
- NOPE, I GOT IT.
- OKAY.

15:08.390 --> 15:10.312
- EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.
I JUST...

15:10.420 --> 15:12.866
WANT TO SORT OF TAKE MY MIND
OFF OF THINGS.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.380
THAT ONE NEEDS A FORK,
BUT--

15:15.500 --> 15:18.879
[sighs] SO I WANTED
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.

15:18.980 --> 15:20.254
- WHAT?

15:20.360 --> 15:22.737
- OKAY, WELL, I TALKED TO MAX
ABOUT HIS SPEECH.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.568
- AND?
- TURNS OUT

15:24.680 --> 15:26.500
HE HAS NOTHING PREPARED.

15:26.610 --> 15:28.157
LIKE, ADAM, ZERO.

15:28.270 --> 15:30.124
HE DIDN'T WRITE DOWN
A STINKIN' THING.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.300
- OKAY. I WILL--I WILL
DEAL WITH HIM AFTER DINNER.

15:32.410 --> 15:33.195
ALL RIGHT? WE'LL MAKE SURE
HE HAS SOMETHING FOR TOMORROW.

15:33.310 --> 15:36.609
- OKAY.
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

15:36.720 --> 15:37.994
- HMM.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.510
CHECK ME IN
AT THE HOSPITAL,

15:39.620 --> 15:42.032
YOU WHIZ OVER THERE
REALLY QUICKLY,

15:42.140 --> 15:44.517
AND CHECK ON HIM,
MAKE SURE HE'S GOOD.

15:44.630 --> 15:45.790
- KRISTINA, I CAN'T.
- I AM OUT TO LUNCH.

15:45.910 --> 15:48.174
- I'M DRUGGED UP.
I'M UNCONSCIOUS, BABE.

15:48.290 --> 15:49.552
- I CAN'T LEAVE YOU
AT THE HOSPITAL.

15:49.670 --> 15:50.420
- YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE
SITTING IN THE WAITING ROOM,

15:50.530 --> 15:52.009
READING A MAGAZINE, SO--

15:52.120 --> 15:53.144
- MAYBE MY DAD CAN GO.

15:53.260 --> 15:54.352
- YOUR DAD?
- WHAT?

15:54.470 --> 15:55.323
- LORD KNOWS WHAT--
- NO, I'LL DO IT.

16:00.640 --> 16:03.291
- [sighs]

16:03.410 --> 16:06.504
- THANK YOU, HADDIE.
- THANK YOU.

16:06.620 --> 16:09.305
[indistinct chatter]

16:09.410 --> 16:11.025
- SO HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN--
- SO YOU'RE FROM--

16:11.140 --> 16:13.540
I'M SORRY. YOU GO.
YOU GO AHEAD.

16:13.660 --> 16:16.345
- UH, NO, I WAS JUST GONNA--

16:16.450 --> 16:18.418
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
WORKED WITH YOUR UNCLES?

16:18.520 --> 16:18.895
- OH, UM...

16:19.010 --> 16:21.001
NOT THAT LONG.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.452
A LITTLE WHILE.
YEAH, BUT IT'S FUN.

16:22.560 --> 16:23.936
- COOL.
- UM...

16:24.050 --> 16:26.564
BEFORE THAT, ACTUALLY,
I WORKED WITH MY AUNT

16:26.670 --> 16:28.114
ON A--
ON AN ELECTION.

16:28.220 --> 16:28.777
- OH, NICE.
- YEAH, HEH.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.916
UH, WE LOST.

16:31.020 --> 16:33.227
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT.

16:33.330 --> 16:35.844
THE JOURNEY WAS AMAZING.
IT WAS REALLY FUN AND,

16:35.960 --> 16:38.918
YOU KNOW, UM,

16:39.030 --> 16:41.749
WE JUST WORKED WELL
TOGETHER AND STUFF, SO--

16:41.860 --> 16:43.999
- YOU MUST BE REALLY CLOSE.

16:44.100 --> 16:45.715
- MM-HMM.

16:47.900 --> 16:49.868
- THAT'S NICE.

16:49.970 --> 16:52.074
- SO...

16:52.180 --> 16:54.933
WHAT ARE WE GONNA GET?

16:55.040 --> 16:55.972
- I HOPE
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE

16:56.080 --> 16:57.354
YOU HAD TO GO OUT ON A DATE
WITH ME.

16:57.460 --> 17:00.008
LIKE, IT WOULD BE RUDE
TO YOUR GRANDPA OR SOMETHING

17:00.120 --> 17:01.257
IF YOU SAID NO.

17:01.360 --> 17:04.944
- NO, RYAN,
I DON'T FEEL LIKE THAT.

17:05.050 --> 17:05.948
- IT JUST KIND OF
SEEMS LIKE...

17:06.050 --> 17:08.052
YOU'RE NOT REALLY INTO IT.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.320
WHICH IS--
WHICH IS TOTALLY FINE.

17:09.440 --> 17:11.158
- NO. GOD.

17:11.270 --> 17:12.362
IT'S NOT THAT.

17:12.470 --> 17:14.745
UM...

17:14.860 --> 17:16.475
I THINK I'M FEELING
DISTRACTED

17:16.580 --> 17:18.684
BECAUSE IT'S, UH,

17:18.790 --> 17:22.419
IT'S MY AUNT'S, LIKE,
SURGERY THINGY TOMORROW.

17:22.520 --> 17:23.726
- OH.
- I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT HER.

17:23.830 --> 17:26.799
AND THEN I JUST REALIZED
THAT I THINK I'VE BEEN

17:26.900 --> 17:29.209
NOT REALLY
DEALING WITH IT, AND...

17:29.320 --> 17:31.174
[crying] I ACTUALLY
FEEL KIND OF SCARED,

17:31.290 --> 17:34.043
'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN AND--

17:34.150 --> 17:36.141
I'M SORRY,
I'M GETTING EMOTIONAL...

17:36.260 --> 17:37.943
- NO, HERE.
- ON OUR FIRST--

17:38.050 --> 17:40.291
FIRST DATE,
SO THAT'S NOT GOOD.

17:40.400 --> 17:43.563
I UNDERSTAND IF THIS IS
JUST TOO HEAW

17:43.680 --> 17:44.954
AND YOU'D RATHER NOT--

17:45.060 --> 17:47.119
- OH, NO.
NO, NO.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.879
I MEAN, IF YOU
WANT TO GO HOME,

17:48.990 --> 17:50.571
I WILL TAKE YOU HOME
RIGHT NOW.

17:50.690 --> 17:53.022
BUT I--BUT IT'S NOT--
IT'S NOT TOO HEAW.

17:53.140 --> 17:55.540
YOU KNOW, I WOULD LOVE
TO BUY YOU A BURRITO

17:55.660 --> 17:57.799
AND TALK SOME MORE
ABOUT YOUR AUNT.

17:57.900 --> 17:59.583
IF THAT'S OKAY.

17:59.690 --> 18:01.317
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:01.420 --> 18:01.966
HOW DO YOU KNOW HER?

18:02.080 --> 18:03.832
[both laugh]

18:03.940 --> 18:05.999
THAT WAS FUNNY.

18:06.110 --> 18:07.691
- WHAT'S SHE LIKE?

18:07.810 --> 18:09.141
- AH...

18:09.260 --> 18:10.591
SHE'S GREAT.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.280
MY MOM'S ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET ME TO GET

18:12.400 --> 18:14.015
A STRONGER LOCK,
BUT, YOU KNOW,

18:14.120 --> 18:16.680
THIS ONE DOES THE TRICK,
SO...

18:16.780 --> 18:18.429
[sighs]

18:18.540 --> 18:18.881
UH...OKAY.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.959
WELL...

18:22.060 --> 18:23.095
THAT WAS GREAT.
THANK YOU.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.782
- YEAH.
- IT WAS REALLY HELPFUL TOO.

18:25.890 --> 18:29.337
- I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE
COULD GET TOGETHER.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.345
- UM...DO YOU WANNA COME IN?

18:33.450 --> 18:38.035
- I-I THINK I BETTER
GET GOING.

18:38.150 --> 18:38.900
- OH. OKAY.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.898
YEAH, I MEAN, I...

18:41.010 --> 18:43.319
SHOULD SLEEP.

18:43.430 --> 18:44.499
BECAUSE SLEEPING'S IMPORTANT.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.807
- YEAH, ME TOO.
- SO...

18:46.910 --> 18:50.630
- WELL, I'LL BE THINKING
ABOUT YOUR AUNT TOMORROW.

18:50.750 --> 18:51.774
GOOD NIGHT.

18:51.880 --> 18:52.744
- GOOD NIGHT.

19:05.480 --> 19:08.415
- MAYBE WE SHOULD
CALL UNCLE CROSBY AGAIN.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.691
- HE SAID HE WAS GONNA BE HERE
IN TEN MINUTES.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.279
- YEAH, HE SAID THAT
A HALF HOUR AGO.

19:11.390 --> 19:12.459
- HADDIE, HE KNOWS
THAT YOUR MOTHER

19:12.560 --> 19:15.211
CAN'T EAT OR DRINK ANYTHING
AFTER 8:00.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.594
SO HE'LL BE HERE.
- OKAY.

19:16.700 --> 19:17.667
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU EAT SOMETHING
BEFORE YOUR SURGERY,

19:17.770 --> 19:19.328
YOU CAN THROW UP
IN YOUR BREATHING TUBE

19:19.430 --> 19:19.942
AND THEN INHALE IT
INTO YOUR LUNGS.

19:20.050 --> 19:22.018
- MAX...STOP.

19:22.120 --> 19:23.257
- IF THAT EVER HAPPENS
TO YOU,

19:23.360 --> 19:25.248
IT'S 100% DEATH RATE.
- OKAY, STOP.

19:25.370 --> 19:26.564
- MAX, THAT'S ENOUGH.
- GREAT. WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

19:26.680 --> 19:28.466
- THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE THEM.
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

19:28.580 --> 19:29.672
- I AM GONNA CALL CROSBY.

19:29.780 --> 19:31.168
- I'M GONNA MAKE MYSELF
A SANDWICH.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.430
THIS IS GETTING
KIND OF SILLY.

19:32.550 --> 19:34.233
I WANT THEM TO EAT,
YOU KNOW?

19:34.340 --> 19:36.786
'CAUSE, LIKE, THEY'VE BEEN
SITTING HERE FOR SO LONG.

19:36.890 --> 19:38.164
- I'M SURE IT'LL BE--

19:38.280 --> 19:39.304
- THERE'S STILL
23 QUINOI MUFFINS IN THE FRIDGE.

19:39.410 --> 19:40.479
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU GUYS
AREN'T EATING THOSE.

19:40.590 --> 19:42.512
YOU TOLD AUNT JULIA
THEY WERE GOOD.

19:51.320 --> 19:51.627
- [whispers]

20:07.750 --> 20:09.377
I GOT IT.

20:20.970 --> 20:21.550

20:21.660 --> 20:23.218

20:23.320 --> 20:25.311
- I'LL GET IT.

20:27.290 --> 20:29.042
OTIS! NO!
- I'M SORRY, I--

20:29.150 --> 20:30.777
- WHAT'S THAT THING
AROUND YOUR HEAD?

20:30.880 --> 20:32.188
OTIS!

20:32.300 --> 20:33.324
- I'M SO SORRY.

20:33.430 --> 20:34.431

20:34.540 --> 20:35.871
AND NOW I'M LATE

20:35.990 --> 20:37.218
- WHY WOULD YOU--
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

20:37.330 --> 20:38.774
- HOW COULD YOU DO THIS?
- IT'S TWO STITCHES.

20:38.890 --> 20:40.221
HE SAID HE'S GONNA BE FINE
IN A COUPLE DAYS.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.602
- HE'S GOT SCARS.
OH, MY GOD.

20:41.720 --> 20:42.926
- I'M SO SORRY.
[overlapping chatter]

20:43.030 --> 20:45.021
- MAX, HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.
HE'S GONNA BE OKAY.

20:45.140 --> 20:46.516
- I TOTALLY BLEW IT.
I'M SORRY.

20:46.620 --> 20:47.894
- YOU DIDN'T BLOW ANYTHING.
- ALL RIGHT, WE GOTTA EAT.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.888
I'M GONNA GET THIS READY.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

20:50.000 --> 20:51.069
- I GOT IT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

20:51.180 --> 20:52.204
- ALL RIGHT.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.379

LIKE, BECAUSE IT'S
A MEDICAL ISSUE.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.793
IT INCLUDES HOUSING...

33:36.560 --> 33:39.768
I'M LIKE THIS BECAUSE I HAVE
SOMETHING CALLED ASPERGER'S.

33:39.870 --> 33:44.284
HAVING ASPERGER'S MAKES SOME
THINGS VERY DIFFICULT FOR ME,

33:44.400 --> 33:46.732
LIKE LOOKING PEOPLE
IN THE EYE

33:46.850 --> 33:48.397
OR SAYING HELLO,

33:48.500 --> 33:51.389
SO I DON'T DO THOSE THINGS
VERY OFTEN.

33:51.510 --> 33:53.842
SOME THINGS ALSO COME
VERY EASILY TO ME

33:53.960 --> 33:55.188
BECAUSE I HAVE ASPERGER'S,

33:55.300 --> 33:59.304
LIKE BEING SMART AND REMEMBERING
ALMOST EVERYTHING.

33:59.410 --> 34:02.447
ALSO, IT MEANS
BEING TENACIOUS,

34:02.550 --> 34:05.371
AND SO I WILL BE TENACIOUS
ABOUT THE VENDING MACHINES.

34:05.490 --> 34:07.720
ANOTHER THING
ABOUT ASPERGER'S

34:07.830 --> 34:09.627
IS THAT I ALWAYS
KEEP MY PROMISES,

34:09.730 --> 34:11.789
SO WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WILL
BRING BACK THE VENDING MACHINES,

34:11.910 --> 34:13.423
YOU CAN BELIEVE ME.

34:13.530 --> 34:15.873
SOME PEOPLE SAY
THAT HAVING ASPERGER'S

34:15.980 --> 34:17.208
CAN SOMETIMES
BE A BAD THING,

34:17.330 --> 34:18.945
BUT I'M GLAD I HAVE IT,

34:19.050 --> 34:21.223
BECAUSE I THINK
IT'S MY GREATEST STRENGTH.

34:21.330 --> 34:22.399
[indistinct chatter]

34:22.500 --> 34:26.368
- VENDING MACHINES!
HELL, YEAH, MAX!

34:26.470 --> 34:33.091
[applause]

34:33.200 --> 34:36.340
[cheers and applause]

34:44.730 --> 34:49.520

34:50.700 --> 34:54.158
- KRISTINA.

34:54.260 --> 34:54.942
- SHE'S GONNA BE NAUSEATED
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

34:55.050 --> 34:56.847
- OKAY.
- OHH.

34:56.950 --> 34:58.815
[monitor beeping]

34:58.920 --> 35:00.399
- KRISTINA.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.952
I'M HERE.
I'M RIGHT HERE.

35:06.060 --> 35:08.949
- HOW DID IT GO?

35:09.070 --> 35:11.857
- THE SURGERY WENT
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT LY.

35:11.970 --> 35:13.824
- HONEY, HOW DID MAX DO?

35:13.930 --> 35:14.965

35:16.900 --> 35:18.276
- HE WON.

35:20.700 --> 35:22.861
HE WON THE ELECTION.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.187
[chuckles]

35:25.290 --> 35:27.212
HONEY, OUR SON
IS THE NEW PRESIDENT

35:27.330 --> 35:30.049
AT CEDAR KNOLL
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

35:30.160 --> 35:33.049
GOD HELP US ALL.

35:33.160 --> 35:33.842
- THESE DRUGS ARE GOOD.

35:33.950 --> 35:36.748
[giggIeSJ

35:36.850 --> 35:38.226
HE WON.

35:38.340 --> 35:39.819
- YOUR SON IS THE PRESIDENT.
- HE WON.

35:39.930 --> 35:41.579
- IT'S EVERY MOTHER'S DREAM.

35:41.690 --> 35:43.260
- [giggIeSJ

35:43.380 --> 35:45.098
[knock at door]

35:45.210 --> 35:47.849
- HI.
- HEY.

35:47.970 --> 35:49.062
- CAN I COME IN?
- MM-HMM.

35:49.180 --> 35:51.068
HOW'S AUNT KRISTINA?

35:51.180 --> 35:53.580
- UH...THE SURGERY WENT WELL,

35:53.700 --> 35:56.760
AND WE NEED A FEW MORE DAYS
TO GET THE RESULTS,

35:56.870 --> 35:58.667
BUT...THEY'RE FEELING GOOD.

35:58.770 --> 36:00.180
- THAT'S GOOD, AT LEAST.

36:00.290 --> 36:01.803
- IT LOOKS NICE IN HERE.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.150
[grunts]
- YEAH.

36:03.260 --> 36:05.637
- MOVE IT.
UHH.

36:05.740 --> 36:06.980
I DID THINK ABOUT YOU,

36:07.090 --> 36:10.537
BUT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
HOW MANY TIMES WE'VE MOVED,

36:10.650 --> 36:12.857
AND I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT
WHERE YOU ARE

36:12.960 --> 36:14.234
IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR,

36:14.340 --> 36:15.955
AND I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT

36:16.070 --> 36:19.688
WHAT THE KIDS
WOULD SAY AT SCHOOL.

36:19.790 --> 36:20.654
[sighs]

36:20.760 --> 36:22.204
SO I'M SORRY
FOR ALL THE THINGS

36:22.310 --> 36:23.481
THAT I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT.

36:23.590 --> 36:26.002
- [laughs]

36:26.110 --> 36:27.316
- IF THIS DOESN'T WORK OUT,

36:27.420 --> 36:30.287
AND YOU WANT TO MOVE BACK
TO GRANDMA AND GRANDPA'S,

36:30.390 --> 36:32.529
YOU KNOW,
LET'S TALK ABOUT IT.

36:32.630 --> 36:35.497
LET'S FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.012
- ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT?

36:38.120 --> 36:41.328
I WANT YOU TO HAVE
A GOOD SENIOR YEAR.

36:41.440 --> 36:45.149
LISTEN, UM, MARK
IS OUT THERE WATCHING CABLE.

36:45.270 --> 36:47.329
HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT HE'S DOING.

36:47.440 --> 36:49.954
- THAT'S A BIG PROBLEM.
I GOTTA GET IN THERE.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.922
[TV chatter]

36:56.040 --> 36:58.065
- [laughs]

36:58.180 --> 36:59.659
- THIS IS AWESOME.

36:59.760 --> 37:01.580
I'M NEVER
READING ANOTHER BOOK AGAIN.

37:01.700 --> 37:03.349
- GREAT.
- THERE'S NO TIME.

37:03.460 --> 37:06.281
[playing guitar]

37:06.390 --> 37:07.243
[knock at door]

37:07.360 --> 37:10.079
- COME IN.
- HELLO?

37:10.190 --> 37:13.353
HI.
- HI.

37:13.470 --> 37:16.462
- HEY, I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU'D BE HERE.

37:16.570 --> 37:17.502
I WAS JUST GONNA LEAVE--
- I LIVE HERE.

37:17.610 --> 37:18.838
- I WAS JUST GONNA
LEAVE THESE HERE,

37:18.960 --> 37:21.884
'CAUSE I WAS THINKING
ABOUT YOUR AUNT TODAY AND--

37:21.990 --> 37:23.127
- OH, WOW,
WELL, THANK YOU.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.060
UM, THAT'S REALLY NICE.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.751
I'LL GIVE THEM
TO HER TOMORROW

37:26.860 --> 37:28.589
WHEN SHE GETS HOME
FROM THE HOSPITAL.

37:28.690 --> 37:31.341
- NO, NO, UM,
THEY'RE NOT FOR HER.

37:31.450 --> 37:33.202
ALTHOUGH, I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT THAT.

37:33.320 --> 37:34.446
BUT, UM--

37:34.560 --> 37:35.549
AND NOW IT SEEMS
REALLY CREEPY

37:35.660 --> 37:37.764
THAT I'M JUST
SHOWING UP AT YOUR HOUSE,

37:37.870 --> 37:39.383
BUT THESE ARE FOR YOU.

37:39.490 --> 37:42.971
- OH, UH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

37:43.080 --> 37:47.915
I'M--

37:48.020 --> 37:49.533
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED.

37:49.640 --> 37:50.777
- OH.

37:50.880 --> 37:53.883
- JUST ABOUT, LIKE,
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

37:53.990 --> 37:55.264
OR--I DON'T KNOW, I JUST--

37:55.370 --> 37:56.644
- I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT YOU, SINCE--

37:56.750 --> 37:59.878
[exhales] THAT--
NOW THAT SOUNDS CREEPY.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.137
- NO, STOP.

38:01.240 --> 38:02.514
OBVIOUSLY I AM
THINKING ABOUT YOU.

38:02.620 --> 38:06.272
BUT, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW.

38:06.380 --> 38:08.826
I INVITED YOU IN AND YOU--
YOU SAID NO.

38:08.940 --> 38:12.489
AND, I MEAN, I'VE NEVER
HAD A GUY SAY NO BEFORE.

38:12.600 --> 38:14.693
I MEAN, NOT THAT
IT'S A PLETHORA OF IN AND OUT,

38:14.800 --> 38:16.427
BUT IT'S--YOU KNOW, I'M JUST--
- NO, I--

38:16.530 --> 38:17.804
_ 50--
- YEAH.

38:17.910 --> 38:20.185
LISTEN, UM,

38:20.290 --> 38:22.110
I REALLY LIKE YOU, AMBER.

38:22.230 --> 38:24.949
I JUST--

38:25.060 --> 38:26.504
I DON'T WANNA
SCREW IT UP,

38:26.610 --> 38:30.535
SO I'D--I JUST WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME--

38:30.650 --> 38:33.369
TAKE IT A LITTLE SLOW,
IF THAT'S COOL.

38:37.760 --> 38:39.443
- OF COURSE.

38:39.550 --> 38:40.892
- OKAY, COOL.

38:41.000 --> 38:42.274
WELL, SO, THEN

38:42.380 --> 38:43.756
MAYBE I'LL CALL YOU
NEXT TIME.

38:43.870 --> 38:45.758
- OKAY.

38:45.870 --> 38:49.078
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

38:53.880 --> 38:56.189
OKAY.

38:56.290 --> 38:57.985
- THANK YOU.

38:58.090 --> 39:00.058
- GOOD NIGHT.

39:03.410 --> 39:07.119
- ALL RIGHT, COWBOY,
OFF TO BED.

39:07.240 --> 39:09.959
I'LL WRAP YOU UP
LIKE A BURRITO.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.899
HEY, YOU KNOW THAT
PRAYING THING YOU DO?

39:15.000 --> 39:15.864
- UH-HUH.

39:15.970 --> 39:17.619
- YOU THINK YOU MIGHT
BE WILLING

39:17.730 --> 39:19.106

HOW IT WORKS?

39:19.210 --> 39:20.381
- OKAY.

39:20.490 --> 39:21.457
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

39:21.560 --> 39:24.859
- I PROMISE
TO RE-BURRITO YOU.

39:27.010 --> 39:28.420
- OH, GOOD, OKAY,
I'M ALREADY ON MY KNEES.

39:28.530 --> 39:30.976
CROSS MY FINGERS

39:31.090 --> 39:32.114
- MM-HMM.
- YEAH, OKAY.

39:32.230 --> 39:34.562
- YOU START BY SAYING,
"DEAR, GOD."

39:34.680 --> 39:36.193
THEN YOU TALK TO HIM

39:36.300 --> 39:37.779
LIKE YOU'RE TALKING
TO A FRIEND.

39:37.890 --> 39:39.573
- OH, WOW,
THAT'S SO INFORMAL.

39:39.680 --> 39:41.989
YOU JUST, "DEAR GOD,"
AND THEN--

39:42.100 --> 39:43.783
- MM-HMM.

39:43.890 --> 39:45.369
UM--HMM.

39:45.480 --> 39:49.064
DEAR GOD, UM,

39:49.170 --> 39:50.819
I KNOW WE DON'T KNOW EACH OTHER
ALL THAT WELL,

39:50.940 --> 39:55.309
BUT YOU'RE REALLY TIGHT
WITH MY SON, SO--

39:55.420 --> 39:59.629
UM, WELL, JABBAR'S AUNT,

40:03.150 --> 40:05.357
- HE ALREADY KNOWS THAT.

40:05.470 --> 40:06.630
- OH, RIGHT. OH, YEAH.
OKAY, DUH.

40:06.740 --> 40:10.676
YEAH, SO IF YOU COULD
LOOK OUT FOR HER

40:10.780 --> 40:13.362
AND--AND MY BROTHER ADAM,
YOU KNOW, IT WOULD--

40:13.480 --> 40:15.402
I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

40:15.510 --> 40:16.989
- OH, AND ALSO PLEASE HELP

40:17.100 --> 40:17.782
MAX'S DOG OTIS FEEL BETTER

40:17.890 --> 40:20.233
AND GET THE CONE
OFF HIS HEAD.

40:20.340 --> 40:21.546
- YEAH.

40:21.660 --> 40:23.616
UH, AMEN TO THAT.
- AMEN.

40:23.730 --> 40:25.652
- SO THE SURGERY
WENT VERY WELL.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.580
HER MARGINS ARE CLEAR,
SO THE CANCER

40:27.700 --> 40:28.382
IN YOUR BREAST IS GONE.

40:28.490 --> 40:30.412
- THAT...
- GOOD.

40:30.530 --> 40:32.486
- IS AMAZING.
I'M SO THANKFUL.

40:32.600 --> 40:33.669
- AND THE SCARRING
WILL FADE AWAY.

40:33.770 --> 40:35.590
- OH, YEAH, I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,

40:35.700 --> 40:36.564
AS LONG AS--AS LONG
AS IT'S OUT, RIGHT?

40:36.670 --> 40:38.638
- GOOD. GOOD,
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

40:38.740 --> 40:40.423
UH, KRISTINA,
UN FORTU NATELY,

40:40.540 --> 40:43.566
ONE OF THE NODES
THAT WE REMOVED HAS CANCER.

40:43.680 --> 40:45.568
AND IT'S JUST IN ONE
OF THE NODES, WHICH IS GOOD.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.954
- SO IT SPREAD?

40:47.060 --> 40:49.119
- WHAT WE DISCOVERED
WAS--WAS VERY SMALL.

40:49.230 --> 40:50.788
BUT IT'S OBVIOUSLY
A CONCERN.

40:50.890 --> 40:52.812
NOW WE ALSO ANALYZED
THE TUMOR

40:52.930 --> 40:54.648
THAT WE REMOVED
FROM YOUR BREAST.

40:54.760 --> 40:56.204
AND WE FOUND THAT THE TYPE
OF CANCER YOU HAVE

40:56.310 --> 40:58.062
IS MORE AGGRESSIVE
THAN WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

40:58.170 --> 41:01.059
YOUR CANCER IS WHAT WE CALL
HER-2/NEU AMPLIFIED.

41:01.180 --> 41:02.135
- HER-2--?

41:02.250 --> 41:03.729
- NOW--
HER-2/NEU AMPLIFIED.

41:03.840 --> 41:06.240
- YOU JUST SAID
THAT THE CANCER WAS GONE.

41:06.360 --> 41:07.588
- YES, IT JUST MEANS

41:07.700 --> 41:09.941
THAT WE NEED TO TREAT
THE CANCER DIFFERENTLY.

41:10.050 --> 41:12.496
NOW WE HAVE A TREATMENT
THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE

41:12.600 --> 41:14.158
VERY EFFECTIVE.
- GREAT.

41:14.260 --> 41:15.488
- AND WE STILL HAVE
A VERY GOOD CHANCE OF CURE.

41:15.610 --> 41:17.293
- I'M SORRY, TREATMENT?
- WILL IT GO AWAY?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.630
- ARE YOU SAYING THAT
SHE'S GONNA NEED CHEMOTHERAPY?

41:19.750 --> 41:21.980
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY THIS
IS NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO SEE.

41:22.100 --> 41:23.670
UM, I'VE SENT THE RESULTS
TO YOUR ONCOLOGIST.

41:23.790 --> 41:26.338
AND WHEN YOU
GET TOGETHER WITH HIM,

41:26.440 --> 41:27.850
HE CAN GO OVER WITH YOU
MORE SPECIFICALLY

41:27.960 --> 41:29.609
YOUR OPTIONS
AND THE TIMING.

41:29.720 --> 41:32.029
LET ME GIVE YOU
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

41:32.140 --> 41:33.789

41:48.740 --> 41:51.152

41:51.260 --> 41:52.466

FOLLOW-UPS, THAT'S IT.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.740

42:00.860 --> 42:02.407
- JUST CHECK-UP,
MAKE SURE

42:02.520 --> 42:04.329
EVERYTHING'S GOOD, STEADY.
- YEAH.

42:04.450 --> 42:05.963
JUST TO MAKE SURE
THAT I'M FEELING BETTER.

42:06.070 --> 42:07.719
AND OTHER THAN THAT...
- YOUR MOTHER IS--

42:07.830 --> 42:09.650
- I AM 100% CANCER-FREE.
- YEAH.

42:09.760 --> 42:10.829
HOW ABOUT THAT?

42:10.940 --> 42:12.032
- I TOLD YOU, YOU NEED
TO STOP WORRYING.

42:12.150 --> 42:14.175
AND WE'RE GONNA
GET YOU BACK TO SCHOOL.

42:14.290 --> 42:15.689
- GOTTA GET YOU
A FLIGHT BACK TO NEW YORK.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.597
- THANK YOU FOR HELPING
SO MUCH THIS WEEK.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.213
- CAN, UM--
- YES, YOU CAN HUG ME.

42:19.320 --> 42:19.661
GIVE ME A HUG.
- OKAY.

42:19.770 --> 42:22.182
- GIVE ME A HUG.

42:22.290 --> 42:23.803
- OH, MY GOD.

42:23.920 --> 42:26.081
OH, MY GOD.
- I LOVE YOU, KIDDO.
