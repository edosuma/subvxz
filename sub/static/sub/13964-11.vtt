[NARRATOR]
Previously on<i> Dark Matter</i> .

00:02.052 --> 00:04.102
[ONE] So what do we do
with this thing now?

00:04.105 --> 00:05.170
Complete the delivery.

00:05.172 --> 00:07.106
Get paid, what else?

00:07.107 --> 00:09.041
[SHADDICK] Whoever delivered
the device could be considered

00:09.043 --> 00:11.143
an accessory to mass murder.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.745
[FOUR]
Who are you?

00:12.746 --> 00:14.346
Chief Inspector Kierken.
Galactic Authority.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.749
I intend to see
each of you face trial.

00:16.751 --> 00:19.451
under the jurisdiction
of the Galactic Authority.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.287
I will return
to claim my throne.

00:22.289 --> 00:24.523
There are those in the court
who are still loyal to me,

00:24.525 --> 00:28.193
but without my memories,
I don't know who to trust.

00:34.201 --> 00:37.236
[TWO, NYX giggling]

00:37.238 --> 00:38.704
You started without me.

00:38.706 --> 00:40.172
[NYX]
Mmm.

00:41.542 --> 00:42.992
So what'd you get?

00:42.993 --> 00:44.443
[FOUR] Cleaning supplies
for my weapons.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.744
There's nothing more
disrespectful than

00:45.746 --> 00:48.547
killing an opponent
with a dirty blade.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.685
What'd you pick up?

00:53.687 --> 00:55.587
Oh, you know, girl stuff.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.390
Scented creams, ammunition...

00:59.360 --> 01:00.759
...knives.

01:02.329 --> 01:04.163
[FOUR]
You heard from the others?

01:04.165 --> 01:06.065
Um...

01:06.067 --> 01:07.132
Three, Five, you there?

01:07.134 --> 01:09.334
[THREE]
Yep. How goes?

01:09.336 --> 01:10.669
[TWO]
The rest of us are done.

01:10.671 --> 01:12.655
Ten more minutes?

01:12.656 --> 01:14.640
[TWO] Well, we're on the other
side of the station, so...

01:14.642 --> 01:16.508
...let's say 20.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.811
Hey, Kid.

01:18.813 --> 01:20.379
Wrap it up.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.780
[FIVE]
Try the red ones.

01:21.782 --> 01:23.382
Yeah?

01:27.321 --> 01:28.720
[gagging]

01:28.722 --> 01:31.256
[FIVE] Yeah, I know.
They're super sour, huh?

01:31.258 --> 01:33.725
[THREE] Agh! My salivary
glands are imploding.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.727
[squishing] Mmm...

01:35.729 --> 01:36.695
I'll see you in ten.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.764
[THREE]
What?

01:38.766 --> 01:39.832
That'll be one bar.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.217
[THREE]
What?!

01:41.218 --> 01:42.601
This ain't a buffet, buddy.
Three pieces for a bar.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.369
You can take another two,
if you like.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.172
I don't like.

01:47.174 --> 01:49.274
But I'm gonna take two, anyway.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.377
And I'll need a bag.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.481
Watch where you're going!

01:56.584 --> 01:59.118
[THREE]
You ran into me, buddy.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.152
You sure about that?

02:00.154 --> 02:01.553
[THREE]
Yep.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.857
Hey!

02:09.830 --> 02:11.897
Well, I guess
I'll go around you, then.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.315
[chuckles]

02:34.388 --> 02:35.787
Come on.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.920
[THREE]
Kid?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.459
Kid.

03:33.514 --> 03:34.913
[TWO]
Okay.

03:39.253 --> 03:40.619
Red.

03:40.621 --> 03:43.222
[laughs]

03:43.224 --> 03:45.557
[FOUR]
Do you ever guess wrong?

03:45.559 --> 03:46.725
Eventually.

03:46.727 --> 03:47.793
[FOUR]
Again.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.394
[TWO]
Let's go.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.502
Red or blue?

04:01.275 --> 04:02.474
Neither.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.309
[FOUR]
Am I that easy to read?

04:04.311 --> 04:07.679
[NYX] It's your unpredictability
that makes you predictable.

04:12.720 --> 04:13.785
[THREE]
She's about this tall,

04:13.787 --> 04:17.322
green hair,
you haven't seen her?

04:17.324 --> 04:18.724
[sighs] Thanks.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.831
[MAN] Hey, uh,
y-you were with the girl,

04:25.833 --> 04:26.598
the one with the green hair.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.516
Yeah.

04:27.517 --> 04:28.433
They took her.

04:28.435 --> 04:29.501
Who did?

04:29.502 --> 04:30.568
Outside. [stammers]

04:31.805 --> 04:33.405
[THREE]
'Scuse me!

04:34.775 --> 04:35.907
[SECURITY GUARD]
Sure it was them?

04:35.909 --> 04:37.509
Positive.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.712
[beeps]

04:49.356 --> 04:50.756
Two, this is Three. Come in.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.892
Nyx, Four, anyone! Come in!

04:57.431 --> 04:58.964
Do you know who they were
or where they went?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.299
[MAN]
Yeah, the Danker brothers.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.633
They probably took her
back to their cabin

05:01.635 --> 05:03.035
[THREE]
Do you have a truck?

05:03.037 --> 05:04.836
Right here, but...

05:04.838 --> 05:05.754
[THREE]
You're driving.

05:05.755 --> 05:06.671
They're dangerous!

05:08.942 --> 05:11.343
[THREE]
They got nothing on me.

05:11.345 --> 05:12.711
Want me to prove it to you?

05:12.713 --> 05:14.479
No...

05:14.481 --> 05:15.947
[THREE]
You're driving.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.924
You seem to have settled
back in quite nicely.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.226
Do I?

05:27.227 --> 05:28.527
[THE ANDROID] Your
physiological indicators suggest

05:28.529 --> 05:29.795
you're quite well-rested;

05:29.797 --> 05:32.064
certainly more relaxed
than my last scanalysis.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.366
Last scanalysis?

05:34.368 --> 05:35.634
How often do you run them?

05:35.636 --> 05:38.737
I regularly monitor
this ship and its crew

05:38.739 --> 05:41.073
for anomalies
and potential red flags.

05:41.075 --> 05:43.442
For instance, I advise

05:43.444 --> 05:45.844
you cut down on
your sodium intake

05:45.846 --> 05:48.914
and increase your consumption
of soluble fiber.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.917
Okay. Good to know.

05:51.919 --> 05:54.820
I also noticed that the
reduction in your stress level

05:54.822 --> 05:57.022
has increased your appetite.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.826
As a result, your body mass
has increased by 2%.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.828
Are you saying I'm fat?

06:02.830 --> 06:06.732
I'm saying... you're
clearly more at ease.

06:06.734 --> 06:10.102
I've decided not to worry
about things I can't change,

06:10.104 --> 06:12.838
like other people's opinions.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.973
You've been granted
full access to the ship

06:14.975 --> 06:16.742
and its systems.

06:16.744 --> 06:20.512
That would suggest a level
of trust and acceptance.

06:20.514 --> 06:21.780
[SIX] Yeah, but they draw
the line at giving me

06:21.782 --> 06:24.416
free run of a station.

06:24.418 --> 06:26.585
Let's be real.

06:26.587 --> 06:28.954
If it wasn't for Two,
I wouldn't be alive,

06:28.956 --> 06:31.022
much less on board this ship.

06:31.024 --> 06:32.858
Granted, some of
the other crew members

06:32.860 --> 06:34.926
may take some time
to come around.

06:34.928 --> 06:36.395
I did betray them.

06:36.397 --> 06:38.096
[THE ANDROID]
They're very forgiving.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.832
When we first met,
I tried to kill you all.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.135
Now I've been accepted
as one of the crew.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.139

06:47.141 --> 06:48.507

What's that?

06:48.509 --> 06:52.177
[ringing continues]

06:52.179 --> 06:54.813
The Raza has just
intercepted a subspace alarm

06:54.815 --> 06:57.816
from the planet's surface.

06:57.818 --> 07:02.154
The station has just enacted
silent lockdown procedures

07:02.156 --> 07:05.857
and sent a coded transmission
to Galactic Authority Central.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.668
Up there.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.053
Who are they?

07:18.054 --> 07:19.437
The Danker brothers.
They're bad news.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.639
They get into all
sorts of trouble--

07:20.641 --> 07:22.174
theft, smuggling...

07:22.175 --> 07:23.708
What d'you suppose
they want with a kid?

07:23.710 --> 07:27.045
All due respect, but your friend
didn't look like a kid to me.

07:29.216 --> 07:31.016

07:31.018 --> 07:33.685

07:34.755 --> 07:36.121
[sighs]
Damn it.

07:36.122 --> 07:37.488
Look, you may have your
reasons for not wanting

07:37.491 --> 07:38.757
to go to the authorities,
but you can't

07:38.759 --> 07:39.958
take on the Dankers alone.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.158
If you've got friends
back at the station,

07:41.161 --> 07:42.194
we should go back for them.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.862
We don't have time for that.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.665
She's alone up there
and defenseless.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.079
What're you gonna do, huh?

08:01.081 --> 08:02.681

08:30.677 --> 08:32.944
If I was going
where you're headed,

08:32.946 --> 08:35.680
probably wanna
stab someone, too.

08:36.783 --> 08:38.617

How many of them are there?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.761
[MAN] Five in all,
but they do a lot of hunting,

08:49.763 --> 08:51.263
so chances are
they're not all there.

[KIERKEN] We've received
unconfirmed reports

09:46.620 --> 09:49.721
that the crew of the Raza
has been seen on this facility.

09:50.324 --> 09:53.725
Consider them armed
and extremely dangerous.

09:53.727 --> 09:55.894
And remember...

09:55.896 --> 09:58.330
...I want them alive.

Now let's go get them.

how they got here so fast.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.263
We need to get back
to the Marauder.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.431
Not without the others.

If the GA secure
the Marauder before we do,

it won't matter.

Because a healthy girl like her?

She'd fetch a far better
price on Stropa-3.

out to the miners.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.139

to the harvesters,

14:25.065 --> 14:26.464
[sighs]

14:29.302 --> 14:31.202
You son of a bitch!

14:31.204 --> 14:32.604
Ah!

14:40.447 --> 14:42.213
Hey.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.381
Kid.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.650
Come on, wake up.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.517
Wake up.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.186
[FIVE]
What...

14:48.188 --> 14:49.354
[groans]

14:49.356 --> 14:50.421
You okay?

14:50.423 --> 14:51.556
Hey.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.391
Oh...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.392
Dizzy.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.994
[THREE]
Yeah.

14:58.331 --> 14:59.931
Take a minute.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.302
Everything's all right.

15:08.041 --> 15:11.075
There were these men, they...

15:11.077 --> 15:12.477
Took care of 'em.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.660
Cleaning lady's
gonna have a fit, huh?

15:28.662 --> 15:30.328
[chuckles]

15:30.330 --> 15:31.529
Where are the others?

15:31.531 --> 15:33.498
Back at the station.

15:35.535 --> 15:38.436
This is Three, come in.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.204
Is anybody receiving?

15:43.944 --> 15:45.243
You have your comm, Kid?

15:45.245 --> 15:46.945
Uh...

15:46.947 --> 15:48.579
No, I must've lost it.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.320
The station's under lockdown.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.455
No one gets in or out.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.157
Clear this area.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.625
Clear this area now!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.527
--[WOMAN screams]
--[MAN] Move. Come on, go, go.

16:02.529 --> 16:04.128
[VOICE]
Move!

16:06.032 --> 16:08.566
[VOICE] Lower your weapons
and stand aside.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.138
Stop.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.002
What're you looking for?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.071
These.

16:47.073 --> 16:48.606
You okay to walk down
to the truck?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.208
Yeah, I think so.

16:51.778 --> 16:52.744
Whoa.

16:52.746 --> 16:54.379
Whoa. Hey.

16:54.381 --> 16:56.614
I'm still kind of dizzy.

16:56.616 --> 16:57.582
[THREE]
All right.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.317
It's no problem.

16:59.319 --> 17:02.020
Just wait here.
I'll bring the truck around.

17:02.022 --> 17:02.754
Hey.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.789
[THREE]
Yeah?

17:04.791 --> 17:07.125
Thanks for coming to get me.

17:08.495 --> 17:11.562
I was scared.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.498
Me too.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.134
Kinda...

17:16.136 --> 17:17.602
Just relax.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.804
I'll have you back
at the Raza in no time.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.711
[gunshots]

17:31.451 --> 17:34.485
The Galactic Authority
is at the station.

17:34.487 --> 17:35.753
What?

17:35.755 --> 17:37.155
How's that possible?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.323
Predominance by proxy.

17:39.325 --> 17:42.160
They used transfer transit.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.729
Apparently, they've
encountered some resistance

17:44.731 --> 17:47.131
and suffered losses.

17:47.133 --> 17:48.783
What about our crew?

17:48.784 --> 17:50.434
They eluded escape
and are still at large.

17:50.437 --> 17:51.803
We still have the
transfer pods we used

17:51.805 --> 17:53.638
to break into
Reynaud's facility.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.673
Could you use one of them
to get me down on that station?

17:55.675 --> 17:56.808
Of course.

17:56.810 --> 17:58.676
[SIX] All right.
Then let's do it.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.412
I'm sorry, Six.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.714
I'm afraid I can't help you.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.817
Are you serious?

18:05.819 --> 18:07.285
What, you don't
trust me, either?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.554
My trust in you is irrelevant.

18:09.556 --> 18:13.091
I'm under strict orders not
to allow you off this ship.

18:13.093 --> 18:16.527
All right, technically,
I'd still be on the ship.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.629
My clone would be
down on the station.

18:18.631 --> 18:22.166
I believe you're sincere
in your desire to make amends

18:22.168 --> 18:24.769
and that you harbor no
ill intent toward the crew.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.104
Thanks.

18:26.105 --> 18:27.438
[THE ANDROID]
Of course, my assumptions

18:27.440 --> 18:29.707
are sometimes fallible,

18:29.709 --> 18:33.678
so I've identified a weakness in
your left ventricular free wall

18:33.680 --> 18:38.483
that I will target if my faith
in you proves to be misplaced.

18:38.485 --> 18:40.184
Good to know.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.786
Yes.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.888
It is good to know.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.525
What is it?

18:47.527 --> 18:48.860
The Marauder.

18:48.862 --> 18:50.595
It's on its way back.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.238
[panting]

19:00.240 --> 19:01.472
Ugh! Shit.

19:01.474 --> 19:02.874
Shit, shit.

19:03.910 --> 19:06.477
[THREE]
Check my back.

19:06.479 --> 19:07.478
Do you see an exit wound?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.546
Uh, yeah, yeah, I see one

19:08.548 --> 19:10.381
[sighs] Good.

19:10.382 --> 19:12.215
Good, we're not gonna have
to root around for a bullet.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.253
[THREE]
I'm bleeding out.

19:15.255 --> 19:16.854
I need you to
cauterize the wound.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.790
Kid!

19:19.792 --> 19:21.659
I need you to help me.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.861
I-- O-O-Okay, okay,
what do you want me to do?

19:23.863 --> 19:25.646
Stop the bleeding.

19:25.647 --> 19:27.430
I need you to find something
to seal the wound.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.372
Okay...

19:35.808 --> 19:37.408
[FIVE]
Okay...

19:39.946 --> 19:42.413
Okay, I-I'm gonna...
disinfect the wound.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.782
[THREE]
Good, good.

19:44.784 --> 19:46.951
Come on. Okay.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.386
Ah, Jesus!

19:48.388 --> 19:50.821
Disinfect it!
Don't get it drunk!

19:50.823 --> 19:52.423
[THREE groans]

19:54.394 --> 19:55.660
[THREE]
Ahh...

19:55.662 --> 19:57.261
Oh, man...

19:59.899 --> 20:01.899
'Kay...

20:01.901 --> 20:03.534
Ready?

20:03.536 --> 20:04.502
Yeah.

20:04.504 --> 20:06.704
[FIVE]
Okay...

20:06.706 --> 20:10.441
[THREE screaming]

20:19.452 --> 20:21.752
You recognize them?

20:21.754 --> 20:23.354
Yeah, they were here
a couple hours ago.

20:23.356 --> 20:25.256
Sold 'em some fruit.

20:25.258 --> 20:26.424
Did you talk to them?

20:26.426 --> 20:29.393
Argued some with the guy.
He was a jerk.

20:29.395 --> 20:30.661
Anything else?

20:30.663 --> 20:32.052
[SHOPKEEPER]
Nah.

20:32.053 --> 20:33.442
He got into it with one
of the locals and he left.

20:33.443 --> 20:34.832
[KIERKEN] What do you mean
by "got into it"?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.767
[SHOPKEEPER] Nothing major,
just a stare down.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.003
Boys being boys, right?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.671
Do you know the name
of this local?

20:40.673 --> 20:42.406
Uh, Temal Danker.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.441
He was in here
with his brother.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.009
Probably good and gone by now.

20:45.011 --> 20:47.745
Hey, you guys
discussing the Dankers?

20:51.351 --> 20:54.485
I've been monitoring
all surface communication.

20:54.487 --> 20:56.821
Your escape has been noted.

20:56.823 --> 20:59.991
Latest reports have the GA
in pursuit of two fugitives.

20:59.993 --> 21:01.959
Their present
whereabouts are unknown.

21:01.961 --> 21:04.362
All right, so they've
managed to evade capture.

21:04.364 --> 21:05.997
But for how long?

21:05.999 --> 21:08.733
We'd be better off
if they did get caught.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.903
Think about it.

21:11.904 --> 21:13.804
At least if they're in custody,
we'd know where they were,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.606
make it easier to retrieve them.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.992
True.

21:17.993 --> 21:20.377
With all nonofficial channels
down within a 20-mile radius

21:20.380 --> 21:23.681
of the station,
we are effectively...

21:23.683 --> 21:25.416
...blind.

21:25.418 --> 21:26.584
[SIX]
We can't just sit here waiting.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.252
We have to do something.

21:28.253 --> 21:29.919
[TWO] Getting back onto that
station is gonna be tough.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.323
They've got all entrances
and exits covered.

21:32.325 --> 21:35.059
Then let's make a new one
with the Marauder.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.428
[SIX] Because I guarantee
you the nearest GA ship

21:37.430 --> 21:39.430
is already en route
to lend backup

21:39.432 --> 21:41.899
and take possession
of any prisoners.

21:41.901 --> 21:43.501
We need to get our people
back aboard this ship

21:43.503 --> 21:45.069
before they get here.

21:45.071 --> 21:46.904
So what's it gonna be?

21:46.906 --> 21:48.506
[gun cocks]

21:49.509 --> 21:51.542
The Android's identified
the station's command

21:51.544 --> 21:53.428
and communication center.

21:53.429 --> 21:55.313
We'll target it going in,
take down their defenses,

21:55.315 --> 21:56.380
then breach and access.

21:56.382 --> 21:57.615
Hopefully create
enough commotion

21:57.617 --> 21:58.716
to draw out Three and Five.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.318
You think they'll know it's us?

22:00.320 --> 22:01.852
Explosions, shooting,
and screaming.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.838
Who else would it be?

22:03.839 --> 22:05.823
I'm assuming I don't need
to ask permission to tag along.

22:05.825 --> 22:07.858
I was gonna ask you
if you wanted to drive.

22:16.336 --> 22:18.069
[THE ANDROID]
Marauder, are you there?

22:19.972 --> 22:21.756
Go ahead.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.541
[THE ANDROID] An assault on
the station won't be necessary.

22:23.543 --> 22:26.410
Five and Three have reportedly
escaped containment.

22:26.412 --> 22:29.513
The GA has pursued them
to a local rural dwelling.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.948
I'm sending you the coordinates.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.550
All right, copy that.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.492
[groaning]

22:41.494 --> 22:42.893
Easy...

22:44.931 --> 22:46.481
[THREE]
How you feeling? Mobile?

22:46.482 --> 22:48.032
[FIVE] Yeah, I'm fine.
I'll be right back.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.534
[THREE]
Whoa, not so fast.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.936
[FIVE] What, you don't
expect me to walk

22:51.938 --> 22:53.471
all the way back to get help.

22:53.473 --> 22:55.072
Nope, because I'm driving.

22:55.074 --> 22:56.474
You can barely move.

22:56.476 --> 22:57.842
I'm fine. Ugh.

22:57.844 --> 22:59.443
[grunting]

22:59.445 --> 23:00.811
You don't sound fine.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.646
And y-you look terrible.

23:02.648 --> 23:04.715
You're all sweaty and pale.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.884
More than usual, anyway.

23:06.886 --> 23:08.703
I'll be fine.

23:08.704 --> 23:10.521
It's nothing that a little R&R
and three shots of plasma

23:10.523 --> 23:12.523
won't fix.

23:12.525 --> 23:13.924
All right.

23:20.466 --> 23:21.599
Good to go.

23:21.600 --> 23:22.733
[GA OFFICER] All right, turn
around. Check that vehicle.

23:22.735 --> 23:24.135
[indistinct chatter]

23:27.907 --> 23:29.940
Well...

23:29.942 --> 23:31.575
...there goes our ride.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.783
[KIERKEN]
Sidearm. Single shot.

23:38.785 --> 23:41.519
He was the last man killed.

23:41.521 --> 23:42.920
Before that...

23:50.797 --> 23:52.897
He catches them by surprise.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.133
[grunts]

23:58.871 --> 24:00.471
[grunts]

24:07.680 --> 24:09.213
[blow landing]

24:10.183 --> 24:14.051
[blows landing,
wet thudding]

24:15.655 --> 24:17.488
Boone or the girl.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.562
[KIERKEN] And one of
them was wounded by...

24:24.564 --> 24:26.096
...the man with the gun.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.539
Close range exchange.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.741
They were both surprised.

24:37.743 --> 24:40.544
Dead man goes down.

24:40.546 --> 24:41.946
Boone gets shot.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.983
And we just missed them.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.852
How do you know?

24:47.854 --> 24:49.086
The only reason they
didn't take the truck

24:49.088 --> 24:51.088
is because we beat them to it.

24:53.192 --> 24:56.260
They'll travel north, northwest,
put as much distance as they can

24:56.262 --> 25:00.064
between us, then circle back
around to the station.

25:00.066 --> 25:01.616
Inform our people.

25:01.617 --> 25:03.167
Have the vehicles
flank them on the roadway.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.835
We're going after them.

25:06.606 --> 25:07.137
[FIVE]
Hey.

25:07.139 --> 25:08.138
[THREE]
Yeah?

25:08.140 --> 25:11.842
[FIVE]
Hey, we should stop.

25:11.844 --> 25:13.644
[THREE]
You tired?

25:13.646 --> 25:15.746
[FIVE]
No, I'm worried about you.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.949
[THREE]
I'm fine.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.619
Yes, yes, I--

25:21.621 --> 25:24.655
I'm tired.
I-I need to stop, okay?

25:24.657 --> 25:26.991
Okay.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.592
[THREE panting]

25:28.594 --> 25:30.728
[groans]

25:30.730 --> 25:33.898
I don't think you can make it.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.700
Oh, thanks for the words
of encouragement.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.770
Should I shoot myself now
or do you wanna do the honors?

25:39.772 --> 25:41.972
[FIVE] I mean, make
it back to the station.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.274
Oh.

25:43.276 --> 25:46.176
[pants]

25:46.178 --> 25:47.545
I'm okay.

25:47.546 --> 25:48.913
--No, you're not. You're hurt.
--I'm okay.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.881
Y-You're bleeding again,
and you're slowing down.

25:50.883 --> 25:52.016
I should go find some help.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.584
No!

25:53.586 --> 25:54.852
No...

25:54.854 --> 25:56.320
I wish you would stop
underestimating me.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.088
Kid.

25:58.090 --> 26:00.558
I stopped underestimating you
when you snuck into my quarters

26:00.560 --> 26:02.126
and you stole
the bullets from my gun.

26:02.128 --> 26:03.994
[chuckles]

26:03.996 --> 26:06.230
There's a difference between
underestimating someone

26:06.232 --> 26:08.332
and not wanting 'em to get hurt.

26:10.136 --> 26:12.202
Damn it.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.810
You could always
give me the gun.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.145
'Fraid not.

26:21.147 --> 26:24.248
[groaning]

26:24.250 --> 26:27.117
You're better off
getting caught than shot.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.986
Me, on the other hand...

26:28.988 --> 26:30.721
...little late for that.

26:31.591 --> 26:33.441
[groans]

26:33.442 --> 26:35.292
[FIVE]
I don't see anyone.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.860
[THREE]
Oh, they're coming.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.629
How can you be so sure?

26:38.631 --> 26:40.931
'Cause I recognized
their leader.

26:40.933 --> 26:42.800
His name's Kierken.

26:42.802 --> 26:45.369
He's one determined
son of a bitch.

26:45.371 --> 26:48.105
Four spent some time with him
during the tunnel collapse

26:48.107 --> 26:49.640
when we were going after Corso.

26:49.642 --> 26:50.841
What's he doing here?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.710
What do you think
he's doing here?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.912
It's not coincidence.

26:54.914 --> 26:57.615
He's after us.

26:57.617 --> 27:00.684
Probably has been since
we escaped from prison.

27:00.686 --> 27:03.754
Followed us to the station,
followed us to that cabin.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.756
Now he's following us
through these woods.

27:05.758 --> 27:07.891
He's not gonna stop
until he has us.

27:12.665 --> 27:14.632
Okay, we need to go.

27:14.634 --> 27:15.833
Now. Come on.

27:15.835 --> 27:17.801
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.041
[THE ANDROID] Five bodies
have been discovered

27:24.043 --> 27:25.876
in and around the target site.

27:25.878 --> 27:28.412
Three and Five are still
reported to be on the run.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.114
The GA is in pursuit.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.715
Copy that.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.317
Run a scan
for heat signatures.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.052
[electronic beeping]

27:35.054 --> 27:36.086
Nothing.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.655
I'm not picking up anything.

27:37.657 --> 27:38.789
They're jamming up
all electronics

27:38.791 --> 27:40.724
and surveillance as well.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.826
We're gonna have to rely
on visual sightings.

27:42.828 --> 27:44.228
Take us in for a closer look.

28:00.146 --> 28:01.445
[groaning]

28:01.447 --> 28:02.446
--[FIVE] Hey.
--[groans]

28:02.448 --> 28:04.048
Hey, come on.

28:05.751 --> 28:07.851
Get up. Let's go.

28:07.853 --> 28:10.387
I can't.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.822
Get up.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.691
There's a change of plans.

28:13.693 --> 28:14.892
We're gonna split up, okay?

28:14.894 --> 28:16.794
No, no. No way.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.829
It was your idea.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.863
Yeah, and I realize now,
a really bad one.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.899
Look, they're right behind us.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.868
Yeah?

28:23.869 --> 28:25.836
I'm not gonna leave you
to be captured or... worse.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.037
What're you talking
about, "captured"?

28:27.039 --> 28:28.839
You're just gonna
draw them away,

28:28.841 --> 28:30.774
buy me some time,
that's all.

28:33.345 --> 28:34.945
Don't lie to me.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.850
I'm not gonna abandon you.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.853
After what happened to One,

28:42.855 --> 28:46.824
I'm just not ready
to lose another friend.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.293
Friend?

28:49.295 --> 28:51.428
Are you kidding me?

28:51.430 --> 28:53.864
I'm not your friend.

28:53.866 --> 28:56.500
I don't give a rat's ass
about you, I never have.

28:56.502 --> 28:59.803
If it was up to me, I'd drop you
off at the nearest space station

28:59.805 --> 29:01.972
and I'd never look back.

29:01.974 --> 29:03.907
I think you are
a pain-in-the-ass,

29:03.909 --> 29:06.043
know-it-all little brat.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.378
You're a burden to the ship.

29:11.117 --> 29:13.484
You know what I wish?

29:13.486 --> 29:17.254
I wish I'd spaced you
when I had the chance.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.422
Oh, is it you're crying now?

29:18.424 --> 29:20.457
--Is that it?
--[FIVE sobs]

29:20.459 --> 29:22.426
You're tearing up
like a little baby?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.027
Why's that?

29:24.029 --> 29:25.929
Is it 'cause
I hurt your feelings?

29:25.931 --> 29:27.965
[sobs]

29:27.967 --> 29:30.300
No...

29:30.302 --> 29:31.802
[sniffles]

29:31.804 --> 29:34.204
No.

29:34.206 --> 29:37.040
I'm crying because I know
what you're trying to do.

29:51.090 --> 29:54.792
You know staying here with me

29:54.794 --> 29:57.261
is not gonna do
either of us any good,

29:57.263 --> 29:59.096
so just go.

30:01.500 --> 30:02.332
Give me your gun.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.834
No.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.335
Well, then toss it,
but don't give them a reason

30:05.337 --> 30:08.272
to shoot you.

30:08.274 --> 30:09.873
Kid...

30:11.410 --> 30:13.010
...please.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.450
Please.

30:34.600 --> 30:37.034
Good luck.

30:37.036 --> 30:38.435
Thanks.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.906

Say hi to the gang for me.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.977
[KIERKEN]
Cease fire!

31:19.979 --> 31:22.145
Cease fire! I want him alive!

31:22.147 --> 31:24.414
Flank him, and have the
trucks cut off his retreat.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.217
[gun clicks]
Come on.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.919
Shit!

31:28.921 --> 31:30.320
Come on...

31:39.098 --> 31:41.365
[THREE groans]

31:41.367 --> 31:44.134
Marcus Boone,
you're under arrest.

31:58.250 --> 32:01.351
Interrogation, file 32486-A.

Kyle Kierken, Chief Inspector

32:02.955 --> 32:05.455

32:05.457 --> 32:07.257
Suspect, please
identify yourself.

32:07.259 --> 32:10.294

32:10.296 --> 32:12.629
Suspect uncooperative.

32:12.631 --> 32:15.399
[ORB] Suspect identified.
Marcus Boone.

32:15.401 --> 32:20.270
Wanted for murder, assault,
kidnapping, piracy, terrorism.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.439
I want you to tell me
all about the circumstances

32:22.441 --> 32:25.142
leading up to the
incident on Iriden-3.

32:25.144 --> 32:27.110
I don't know what
you're talking about.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.113
[KIERKEN] Over 15,000 people
died after you and your crew

32:30.115 --> 32:32.416
delivered a prototype
white hole bomb

32:32.418 --> 32:35.252
to a Mikkei research
facility on that planet.

32:35.254 --> 32:37.587
I don't know anything about
that, but even if I did,

32:37.589 --> 32:39.189
and I'm not saying I do...

32:41.694 --> 32:44.227
...what difference
does it make?

32:44.229 --> 32:48.598
Right now, Mikkei
is set to take the fall.

32:48.600 --> 32:52.536
But I have a feeling
that if you come clean,

32:52.538 --> 32:55.739
we can deal some serious damage
to two major corporations.

32:55.741 --> 32:58.075
Why would you wanna do that?

32:58.077 --> 32:59.643
Because, right now,
it's probably the only way

32:59.645 --> 33:03.146
to head off an
intergalactic corporate war.

33:03.148 --> 33:05.315
Oh, yes. There's one on the way.

33:05.317 --> 33:08.285
And if it comes,
those 15,000 deaths,

33:08.287 --> 33:10.153
they'll just be
a drop in the bucket.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.256
Now, I can either
get the truth from you,

33:13.258 --> 33:14.758
or I can wait...

33:14.760 --> 33:17.094
...and get it
from Emily Kolburn.

33:17.096 --> 33:18.495
Who's that?

33:18.497 --> 33:21.164
The one you call Five.

33:21.166 --> 33:23.000
I know she's here with you.

33:25.204 --> 33:27.738
Last I saw,
she was up in the ship.

33:27.740 --> 33:31.274
If you want her that badly,
that's where you'll find her.

33:31.276 --> 33:32.709
Oh, I'll find her, all right.

33:32.711 --> 33:35.045
Sooner or later.

33:35.047 --> 33:39.316
But what happens to her after I
find her is entirely up to you.

33:39.318 --> 33:42.052
She was party to
the destruction on Iriden-3.

33:42.054 --> 33:44.755
She'll be facing multiple
life sentences, at the least.

33:44.757 --> 33:48.425
Execution would also
be on the table.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.260
I know what you're thinking.

33:50.261 --> 33:52.094
You're thinking that if you tell
the truth about what happened

33:52.097 --> 33:55.632
that day, you'll be implicating
yourself and your crew.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.101
But given the litany
of offenses you already face,

33:58.103 --> 34:00.203
it won't make a difference
in the long run.

34:00.205 --> 34:04.341
You're all going down
for a very long time.

34:04.343 --> 34:08.645
Do you really want to drag that
poor young girl down with you?

34:08.647 --> 34:12.115
I can wipe her record clean,
give her a fresh start,

34:12.117 --> 34:15.118
let her be a kid again.

34:15.120 --> 34:16.753
But it's up to you.

35:07.239 --> 35:09.473
Brush is too thick.
I can't see anything.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.174
We should land,
search on foot.

35:11.176 --> 35:12.843
No, the nearest
clearing's a ways out.

35:12.845 --> 35:15.312
Okay, we'll do one more sweep,
and then we'll land.

35:19.852 --> 35:21.818
That's your friends
looking for you.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.789
Lieutenant,
is the missile prepped?

35:26.692 --> 35:28.625
[LIEUTENANT]
Yes, sir.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.427
Save the girl.

35:30.429 --> 35:33.430
Save your friends
on board that shuttle.

35:34.399 --> 35:35.832
[grunts]

35:40.405 --> 35:42.906
We were hired by
Mikkei's Commander Truffault

35:42.908 --> 35:46.376
to steal a device
from another corporation.

35:46.378 --> 35:47.677
Traugott.

35:47.679 --> 35:49.913
Did you know what it was
you were stealing?

35:49.915 --> 35:51.414
[THREE]
No.

35:51.416 --> 35:53.183
Who else was involved?

35:53.185 --> 35:54.684
Lin? Ishida?

35:54.686 --> 35:56.253
No.

35:56.255 --> 35:58.755
They had a bad feeling
about the op.

35:58.757 --> 35:59.890
They respectfully declined.

35:59.892 --> 36:01.575
[chuckles]

36:01.576 --> 36:03.259
You expect me to believe
you acted alone?

36:03.262 --> 36:04.461
[THREE]
No, I had help.

36:04.463 --> 36:07.364
Another crew, led
by a guy named Wexler.

36:07.366 --> 36:11.902
Other team members:
Tash, Vons, Cain.

36:11.904 --> 36:14.504
I'm sure you can dig up
their rap sheets.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.240
Do you have any idea
where these men are now?

36:17.242 --> 36:19.326
[THREE]
Can't say.

36:19.327 --> 36:21.411
You know, we left on
not the best of terms.

36:21.413 --> 36:25.215
So no one else from the crew
of the Raza was involved?

36:25.217 --> 36:27.350
I just told you.

36:27.352 --> 36:28.785
It was only me.

36:31.523 --> 36:32.923
Lieutenant...

36:34.927 --> 36:36.359
...take them down.

36:36.361 --> 36:37.360
You son of a bitch!

36:37.362 --> 36:39.529
[grunting]

36:42.234 --> 36:43.633
Copy.

36:48.273 --> 36:50.207
[beeping]

36:53.946 --> 36:55.379
What was that?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.813
Well, we were looking
for a landing site.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.915
Looks like someone
just made one.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.517
Take us down.

37:03.589 --> 37:06.723
[coughing]

37:13.599 --> 37:15.832
Helps to be down
in the first place.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.904
Drop your guns.

37:21.773 --> 37:23.907
Or I put a bullet
through his head.

37:25.377 --> 37:28.278
We used transfer
trans to get here.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.946
I'm a clone.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.748
A clone with all the memories
you made over the past

37:31.750 --> 37:34.484
two hours, memories
that would die with you

37:34.486 --> 37:35.518
if I pull this trigger.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.525
All things being equal...

37:43.996 --> 37:47.364
...I'm guessing that you'd
rather know than not.

37:50.669 --> 37:52.369
[TWO]
Drop your weapons!

37:57.542 --> 37:58.508
You okay?

37:58.510 --> 38:01.611
[THREE panting]

38:01.613 --> 38:03.446
I've been shot.

38:03.448 --> 38:05.582
What do you think?

38:05.584 --> 38:06.616
No.

38:06.618 --> 38:07.884
He's just a clone.

38:07.886 --> 38:09.486
[THREE]
I know.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.872
Leave him something
to remember us by.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.690
Hey, look who it is.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.360
Come by to thank me, huh?

38:50.362 --> 38:51.861
Thank you for what?

38:51.863 --> 38:53.697
For saving your life
back on the planet.

38:53.699 --> 38:55.532
[chuckles]

38:55.534 --> 38:57.000
Fine.

38:57.002 --> 38:59.536
Thank you for saving my life.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.004
You are welcome.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.507
So you're gonna be okay?

39:04.509 --> 39:07.110
Aw, yeah.

39:07.111 --> 39:09.712
Yeah, I'll, um, I'll be up and
at it in no time, you'll see.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.114
Good.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.785
[THREE]
Hey.

39:15.787 --> 39:18.054
This isn't gonna change
anything between us, is it?

39:18.056 --> 39:20.523
You're not gonna go all
soft and sweet on me?

39:20.525 --> 39:23.560
Oh, I won't.

39:23.562 --> 39:24.961
Good.

39:25.931 --> 39:27.731
[THREE]
What's this?

39:27.733 --> 39:29.799
I made you some oatmeal.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.634
Thank you.

39:34.773 --> 39:36.373
[chuckles]

39:40.112 --> 39:42.112
Oh, and I put in some of
that fruit you picked up

39:42.114 --> 39:43.713
at the space station.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.950
[FIVE]
See you later.

39:51.656 --> 39:53.923
[chuckles]

39:53.925 --> 39:55.525
Ugh.

39:58.997 --> 40:00.597
What're you watching?

40:00.599 --> 40:02.098
[SIX] The weekly news packet
The Android downloaded

40:02.100 --> 40:03.566
from the station's data hub.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.818
[TWO]
Oh, yeah?

40:04.819 --> 40:06.069
Keeping up on
current events and trends?

40:06.071 --> 40:08.805
Snow cap skirts
and ocular piercings are in.

40:08.807 --> 40:10.991
[TWO]
Ugh.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.176
Apparently, so are uprisings
in the outer colonies.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.844
[TWO]
Mm.

40:14.846 --> 40:16.780
Rebellions are brewing
all over colonized space,

40:16.782 --> 40:18.114
the GA's stretched thin,

40:18.116 --> 40:19.783
a corporate war looming...

40:19.785 --> 40:23.520
The status quo is headed
for one hell of a shake-up.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.622
Change is good.

40:25.624 --> 40:26.756
Change is interesting,

40:26.758 --> 40:28.458
at least for a while.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.427
Then everything
eventually resets itself.

40:30.429 --> 40:32.862
Same game, different players.

40:32.864 --> 40:35.598
Maybe not.

40:35.600 --> 40:37.934
Maybe this is an opportunity,

40:37.936 --> 40:40.904
especially now that
we have the Blink Drive.

40:40.906 --> 40:45.108
I mean, it gives us the power
to make a difference.

40:45.110 --> 40:47.544
Let them fight it out,
weaken each other to the point

40:47.546 --> 40:49.145
where we can step in
and finish them off,

40:49.147 --> 40:51.948
all of them--the
corporations, the GA.

40:51.950 --> 40:53.583
And then what?

40:53.585 --> 40:55.585
Let chaos and anarchy rule?

40:55.587 --> 40:56.986
That would be better?

40:56.988 --> 40:59.189
Maybe for us, but
what about the civilians?

40:59.191 --> 41:01.791
The people that rely on the
authority to keep them safe?

41:01.793 --> 41:02.992
We'll keep them safe.

41:02.994 --> 41:04.160
Right.

41:04.162 --> 41:05.995
From outlaws to peacekeepers.

41:05.997 --> 41:08.131
The people can choose
their own leaders,

41:08.133 --> 41:10.083
police themselves.

41:10.084 --> 41:12.034
And if there's ever a situation
too big for them to handle,

41:12.037 --> 41:14.003
we can step in to quash it.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.105
This ship gives us that power.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.775
What if the others on board
aren't into this idea

41:18.777 --> 41:20.844
of us being
intergalactic cops?

41:20.846 --> 41:22.879
Then you convince them.

41:24.916 --> 41:27.550
Being a powerful and respected
force in a power vacuum

41:27.552 --> 41:29.085
will have its perks.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.756
Change is coming...

41:33.758 --> 41:35.191
...whether we like it or not.

42:17.035 --> 42:18.935
[THE ANDROID]
Hello, Four.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.136
You're up late.

42:20.138 --> 42:22.305
A lot on your mind?

42:22.307 --> 42:25.808
In truth, not enough.

42:29.147 --> 42:32.015
It's my neural imprint.

42:32.017 --> 42:34.017
I want to upload it

42:34.019 --> 42:36.953
and regain the memories
of Ishida Ryo.

42:36.955 --> 42:39.022
I need your help to do it.
