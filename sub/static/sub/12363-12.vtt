Previously on <i>Longmire...</i>

00:02.666 --> 00:04.689
- How'd you find me anyway?
- I used to be a cop.

00:04.809 --> 00:06.789
Seems like you're
just asking for trouble.

00:06.909 --> 00:09.081
Well, you'd know a lot about that
wouldn't you Moretti?

00:09.201 --> 00:14.024
I didn't donate $100,000 to your campaign
because I like your smile.

00:14.144 --> 00:17.563
I promised Henry I'd get out the vote.
A lot of people on the Res don't have cars.

00:19.359 --> 00:21.552
Your ex girlfriend is in critical
condition after getting hit by a car.

00:21.672 --> 00:24.437
You didn't have anything to do
with Cady's accident, did you?

00:24.557 --> 00:29.946
Don't look back. It's better to keep
your eyes down the road.

00:32.327 --> 00:37.831
The cowboy has always been
a dying breed.

00:37.899 --> 00:41.202
But he takes his dying slowly,

00:41.303 --> 00:43.904
perched upon his steed.

00:43.972 --> 00:47.241
The prairie is his prison,

00:47.342 --> 00:50.144
his church, his wife.

00:50.245 --> 00:53.147
And if you take away his sky,

00:53.248 --> 00:55.549
you take away his life.

00:55.617 --> 00:58.018
Yet, where does he go

00:58.086 --> 01:00.621
when the ranges all have closed?

01:02.524 --> 01:05.125
Does he retire to his bunkhouse

01:05.227 --> 01:08.329
in depressed repose?

01:13.134 --> 01:17.137
No, he climbs
back in that saddle,

01:17.239 --> 01:20.074
if just to bide his time.

01:20.175 --> 01:24.211
The cowboy knows

01:24.312 --> 01:26.447
a good death...

01:28.149 --> 01:30.451
Is hard to find.

01:50.138 --> 01:52.006
Thanks.

02:08.056 --> 02:09.323
Ed.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.898
All the bank manager
could tell me

02:17.966 --> 02:19.867
was that the safety deposit box

02:19.968 --> 02:22.136
was rented to a man
named James Notley.

02:22.237 --> 02:24.105
And Notley's will said
that when he died,

02:24.172 --> 02:27.208
they had to deliver this box
to the Absaroka County Sheriff.

02:27.328 --> 02:28.166
Ruby?

02:28.286 --> 02:31.137
Check our records
for James Notley. Already on it.

02:31.257 --> 02:33.180
James Notley sent this here
for a reason.

02:33.248 --> 02:34.548
Ferg, you got any salt?

02:34.616 --> 02:36.884
Uh... I think so.

02:41.056 --> 02:42.957
You want the pepper, too, or...

02:43.058 --> 02:46.160
Nope.
Just the salt.

02:49.064 --> 02:51.599
Branch, hand me your water.

02:51.700 --> 02:53.234
You making a saline solution?

02:53.335 --> 02:55.736
Let the finger soak
for a few hours,

02:55.804 --> 02:59.006
we'll be able to hydrate it
and get a print off it.

02:59.074 --> 03:02.243
James Notley's been
in the state penitentiary

03:02.344 --> 03:04.078
since 1989.

03:04.179 --> 03:06.047
Lucian arrested him
for armed robbery.

03:06.148 --> 03:08.849
I guess I better
go talk to Lucian.

03:08.950 --> 03:12.586
Come on, Branch.
Let's go shake your family tree.

03:12.687 --> 03:15.890
The ideal woman
is like a good cowboy stew...

03:15.991 --> 03:18.592
Meaty and saucy
and easy to chew.

03:18.693 --> 03:21.962
Her spuds should be yummy
without being gummy,

03:22.064 --> 03:24.885
and her scent should never
turn your face blue.

03:25.005 --> 03:25.628
Lucian...

03:25.748 --> 03:27.068
We need to talk.

03:27.169 --> 03:28.803
Good, 'cause this here boy's

03:28.904 --> 03:31.172
a few iambs short
of a full pentameter anyway.

03:31.273 --> 03:32.740
Can we use your office?

03:32.808 --> 03:35.076
And miss all this?

03:36.611 --> 03:39.447
Now for the pivotal
middle portion

03:39.548 --> 03:42.750
of my love-struck cowboy
limerick triptych.

03:44.086 --> 03:46.620
I want to know
about James Notley.

03:47.956 --> 03:48.889
Who?

03:48.990 --> 03:49.957
James Notley.

03:50.058 --> 03:51.992
You arrested him, 1989.

03:52.094 --> 03:53.794
Along with plenty other men.

03:53.895 --> 03:55.996
- You need to be more specific, Walt.
- Armed robbery.

03:56.098 --> 03:57.832
Nope.
Still can't place him.

03:57.899 --> 03:59.100
Too many French fries.

03:59.201 --> 04:00.968
- What?
- Trans fats.

04:01.036 --> 04:03.104
Causes brain shrinkage,
therefore memory loss.

04:03.171 --> 04:05.172
I read about that
in an issue of <i>Neurology.</i>

04:05.273 --> 04:07.675
James Notley sent me
a severed finger today.

04:07.742 --> 04:09.143
That trigger any memories?

04:09.244 --> 04:11.946
You know, Walt, folks weren't
so chatty back in my day.

04:12.013 --> 04:14.148
I may have had to shorten
many a man's finger.

04:14.249 --> 04:15.783
You chopped off fingers?

04:15.884 --> 04:16.916
Seriously?

04:17.017 --> 04:18.519
Hell, boy, it was the '70s...

04:18.620 --> 04:19.820
Watergate, women's lib.

04:19.921 --> 04:20.954
All bets were off.

04:21.055 --> 04:23.313
This arrest was made in 1989.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.350
James Notley.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.325
Armed robbery.
Missing finger.

04:27.445 --> 04:28.629
Oh!

04:28.730 --> 04:29.997
Yes.

04:30.098 --> 04:31.932
Notley.

04:32.000 --> 04:33.901
Right.

04:34.002 --> 04:35.936
Synapses are firing now.

04:36.004 --> 04:37.538
Yep.

04:37.639 --> 04:40.708
I arrested that man
for stealing dinosaur bones.

04:43.111 --> 04:45.079
Excuse me.

04:48.717 --> 04:49.617
Hello?

04:49.718 --> 04:50.885
Ed!

04:50.986 --> 04:52.219
It's Vic Moretti.

04:52.287 --> 04:54.054
How are you?

04:54.156 --> 04:56.757
Deputy Moretti,
I was just thinking about you.

04:56.825 --> 04:59.125
You and your wife aren't still
in Durant, are you?

04:59.443 --> 05:02.398
'Cause Sean
just got back to town.

05:02.518 --> 05:04.131
We could go to dinner
at the Red Pony.

05:04.232 --> 05:05.532
Oh, thanks for the invite.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.035
We headed back to Philly
a few weeks ago.

05:09.137 --> 05:10.370
That's too bad.

05:10.472 --> 05:11.839
Well...

05:11.940 --> 05:14.308
we'll have to take
a rain check, huh?

05:14.409 --> 05:15.342
Yes, we will.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.277
Take good care of yourself.

05:17.378 --> 05:18.378
You, too, Ed.

05:29.924 --> 05:32.759
Distance from caller...

05:32.861 --> 05:34.928
8 1/2 Miles.

05:46.140 --> 05:49.009
A lot of these prisoners
will hold it in until rec time,

05:49.110 --> 05:51.979
so they can... unload
with a little privacy.

05:52.046 --> 05:53.380
That's what James did,

05:53.481 --> 05:56.216
and he was stabbed 13 times
mid-delivery

05:56.317 --> 05:58.185
and just two weeks away
from his release.

05:58.253 --> 06:00.387
- You find out who did it?
- No.

06:00.488 --> 06:02.289
I don't think we will, either.

06:02.390 --> 06:05.125
Someone covered the lens
of that security camera,

06:05.226 --> 06:07.961
and this place is packed
with killers, literally.

06:08.062 --> 06:09.396
James have any enemies?

06:09.497 --> 06:10.931
Not that I know of.

06:11.032 --> 06:13.367
But if he made eye contact
with the wrong maniac,

06:13.434 --> 06:14.935
that's all it would take.

06:15.036 --> 06:16.470
Hell, if one of these lifers

06:16.571 --> 06:18.505
knew James
was gonna be released,

06:18.606 --> 06:20.440
he may have gone all stabby
out of spite.

06:20.508 --> 06:23.874
The D.O.C. usually handles
prison deaths, sheriff.

06:23.994 --> 06:25.979
And you're from the other side
of the state.

06:26.080 --> 06:28.482
Why are you so interested
in James Notley?

06:28.583 --> 06:31.251
Actually, James seemed to take
an interest in me.

06:31.352 --> 06:33.754
He had a package, uh,
sent to my office.

06:33.855 --> 06:35.422
I'm trying to figure out why.

06:35.523 --> 06:37.391
He have any recent visitors?

06:37.492 --> 06:38.792
Let me take a look.

06:43.164 --> 06:44.431
According to our records,

06:44.532 --> 06:47.167
his only recent visitors
are this Connie Mallery,

06:47.268 --> 06:49.069
who I assume
to be his girlfriend,

06:49.170 --> 06:51.171
and... you.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.473
Me?

06:53.575 --> 06:56.143
Log-in says you were here
exactly one week ago.

06:56.244 --> 06:57.611
Can I take a look at that?

06:59.948 --> 07:02.516
You are the sheriff
of Absaroka County, right?

07:02.617 --> 07:04.985
Lucian.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.621
You said you didn't remember
James Notley.

07:11.741 --> 07:14.598
Prison records say you visited
him just a week ago.

07:14.718 --> 07:17.226
Well, I guess my memory's
worse off than I thought.

07:17.293 --> 07:18.256
I doubt that.

07:18.376 --> 07:19.551
You know,
you and I have been playing

07:19.671 --> 07:21.795
this here match
for nigh on to six weeks now.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.500
Right now I need you
to answer my questions.

07:24.601 --> 07:26.394
Only if you play this game.

07:26.514 --> 07:27.503
Get up.

07:31.675 --> 07:32.608
Okay.

07:34.445 --> 07:36.846
Tell me about James Notley.

07:36.966 --> 07:40.148
That man was a pain in my ass.

07:40.215 --> 07:42.516
He smuggled dinosaur bones
out of the state of Wyoming

07:42.636 --> 07:44.301
and sold them overseas.

07:44.421 --> 07:46.457
Ergo, he was a rank opportunist

07:46.577 --> 07:49.373
and a speed bump on the road
to scientific progress.

07:49.493 --> 07:52.169
So, how does a speed bump
manage to smuggle dinosaur bones

07:52.289 --> 07:53.778
out from under your nose?

07:53.846 --> 07:56.114
Well, in the summer of 1989,
the university dug up

07:56.215 --> 07:58.750
a complete skeleton
of a Triceratops.

07:58.851 --> 08:01.786
It was valued at $800,000.

08:01.854 --> 08:05.090
And Notley waited
until they crate the thing up.

08:05.191 --> 08:07.092
Shows up at the university,

08:07.193 --> 08:09.346
forced some grad student
at gunpoint

08:09.466 --> 08:11.329
to load the crates into a van.

08:11.397 --> 08:13.198
About a week later,
I get him to confess.

08:13.299 --> 08:15.267
By cutting that off?

08:15.368 --> 08:18.336
By busting
the bastard's alibi, nephew!

08:18.404 --> 08:21.171
Anyway, he had all his fingers
when I saw him last week.

08:21.291 --> 08:23.610
As I recall,
the two middle ones

08:23.730 --> 08:26.377
seemed particularly healthy
and robust.

08:26.497 --> 08:28.586
Why the visit?
Nostalgia?

08:28.706 --> 08:29.735
Money.

08:29.855 --> 08:31.783
By the time
I'd arrested Notley,

08:31.851 --> 08:33.717
he had already unloaded
them fossils,

08:33.818 --> 08:35.518
but there was no sign
of the cash he made off of 'em.

08:35.638 --> 08:37.639
And I knew
he'd stash it someplace.

08:37.741 --> 08:38.907
I just offered to go 50/50.

08:39.008 --> 08:41.477
The 800 grand?

08:41.578 --> 08:42.644
No.

08:43.546 --> 08:44.997
On the finder's fee.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.732
And as I told Notley,

08:47.833 --> 08:49.393
a finder can command up to,
I don't know,

08:49.513 --> 08:51.814
50% of any missing money
he finds.

08:51.934 --> 08:54.926
Why would James
want to give you half of 50%?

08:55.046 --> 08:57.348
Because he knew
I'd either find the money

08:57.468 --> 08:59.009
or find him with the money.

08:59.129 --> 09:02.083
And either way, he'd be screwed
as a cat in a dog pound.

09:02.203 --> 09:04.928
Some people
would call that blackmail.

09:05.048 --> 09:08.304
And some people can kiss
my once-magnificent rump.

09:08.424 --> 09:09.792
So, why'd he send the finger?

09:09.912 --> 09:10.728
I don't know.

09:10.848 --> 09:12.160
As a souvenir?

09:12.280 --> 09:13.538
From what?

09:13.658 --> 09:16.093
Night of the robbery.

09:25.404 --> 09:27.539
There you are.

09:44.423 --> 09:46.458
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

09:46.525 --> 09:49.761
I thought I was doing
the speed limit, deputy.

09:49.862 --> 09:51.929
You told me
you were in Philadelphia.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.626
Yes, I did.

09:55.968 --> 09:57.436
Careful.

09:57.537 --> 09:58.904
I said I was in Philly
because I was afraid

09:59.005 --> 10:02.308
something like this might happen
if you knew I was here.

10:02.409 --> 10:04.643
Honestly, Moretti,
the last time we met,

10:04.711 --> 10:05.845
you creeped me out.

10:05.912 --> 10:07.880
It's not like
I broke into your car.

10:07.981 --> 10:10.616
You okay?
You seem a little paranoid.

10:10.717 --> 10:12.618
What are you doing
in Durant, Ed?

10:12.719 --> 10:13.819
Ahh

10:13.920 --> 10:16.555
Something about this place.

10:16.623 --> 10:18.858
A lot to live for here.

10:18.959 --> 10:22.461
Besides,
I'm pretty sure I can go

10:22.562 --> 10:25.231
absolutely anywhere I want to.

10:25.332 --> 10:28.801
Are you sure you're okay?
You seem a little tightly wound.

10:28.902 --> 10:31.737
That is a natural reaction
to being stalked!

10:31.805 --> 10:33.305
Wow.
That's funny,

10:33.373 --> 10:35.674
because it feels like
you're stalking me.

10:35.742 --> 10:39.979
I mean, how did you, uh,
know where to find me, huh?

10:40.080 --> 10:42.514
Triangulate my cellphone?

10:42.616 --> 10:44.783
You did.

10:44.885 --> 10:45.918
Okay.

10:46.019 --> 10:48.754
There's no easy way
to say this,

10:48.822 --> 10:51.523
but I don't want you
to contact me again.

10:51.625 --> 10:53.893
You're making me feel
uncomfortable.

10:53.994 --> 10:56.562
And, quite frankly,
pretty violated.

11:01.367 --> 11:02.968
Have a nice day.

11:05.421 --> 11:06.835
Nope, sorry. No.

11:06.955 --> 11:08.507
Conference hours are over.

11:08.608 --> 11:10.643
Professor Tony Moten?

11:10.744 --> 11:14.947
I'd like to talk to you
about James Notley.

11:15.015 --> 11:16.515
It was after 2:00 A.M.,

11:16.616 --> 11:18.851
and we had brought
the Triceratops in

11:18.919 --> 11:20.352
earlier that afternoon.

11:20.453 --> 11:21.954
And as a doctoral candidate,

11:22.022 --> 11:26.558
it was my job to sort
and catalogue the vertebrae.

11:26.660 --> 11:28.928
How did James Notley get in?

11:29.029 --> 11:30.529
I opened the door.

11:30.630 --> 11:32.331
Why?

11:32.432 --> 11:33.666
He knocked.

11:33.733 --> 11:35.200
What happened then?

11:36.627 --> 11:38.416
Look, this was 24 years ago,

11:38.536 --> 11:40.773
and it's taken me just about
as long to get over it.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.942
Why are you asking me
to do this all over again?

11:44.062 --> 11:47.379
James Notley is due to be released
from the state prison in about a week.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.515
You think he still blames me
for his arrest?

11:49.616 --> 11:51.184
That's hard to tell.

11:52.351 --> 11:53.647
I opened the door.

11:53.767 --> 11:55.397
A guy in a ski mask comes out.

11:55.517 --> 11:57.111
He's got his gun in my face.

11:57.231 --> 11:59.391
He tells me that he's gonna take
bones with him,

11:59.511 --> 12:00.659
whether they're mine
or the dinosaur's.

12:00.760 --> 12:02.528
It's up to me to decide.

12:02.629 --> 12:04.363
I tried to stall him.
The next thing I know,

12:04.464 --> 12:05.931
he's got my arm pinned
to this table here.

12:06.032 --> 12:08.000
He pulls out a pocketknife,
and he cuts off my finger.

12:08.101 --> 12:11.837
It took him three times
to get it all the way off!

12:11.938 --> 12:13.572
Did he have anyone else
with him?

12:13.673 --> 12:15.274
Not that I saw, no.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.943
You asked if James Notley

12:18.044 --> 12:19.311
still blamed you
for his arrest.

12:19.379 --> 12:20.713
Why?

12:20.814 --> 12:22.848
I described the pocketknife
that he had to the sheriff,

12:22.949 --> 12:24.750
and I think
that's what got him convicted.

12:26.753 --> 12:28.977
So, what'd he do
with your finger?

12:29.097 --> 12:30.687
I don't know.

12:30.988 --> 12:33.826
I was just focused
on trying to survive.

12:35.028 --> 12:37.763
It's pretty convenient
that James robbed them

12:37.864 --> 12:39.774
on the same day
they brought in the skeleton.

12:39.894 --> 12:43.369
Dr. Moten might have been
James' inside man.

12:43.470 --> 12:44.803
If he was,

12:44.904 --> 12:47.473
means he had his own finger
cut off for cover.

12:47.574 --> 12:48.974
Might've been worth it.

12:49.042 --> 12:51.543
My Uncle said that skeleton
was worth 800 grand.

12:51.644 --> 12:52.711
Split that two ways,

12:52.812 --> 12:54.513
I'd say it's still worth
a finger.

12:54.581 --> 12:56.882
And if your partner
gets murdered in prison,

12:56.950 --> 12:58.937
you wouldn't have to share
the money at all.

12:59.057 --> 13:01.659
Well, maybe that's why
James had the finger sent in...

13:01.779 --> 13:04.423
To point the finger
at his partner.

13:04.491 --> 13:06.323
"Point the finger."

13:06.443 --> 13:07.595
That was a joke.

13:07.715 --> 13:09.461
I know it was.

13:15.035 --> 13:17.936
So, what do we have?

13:18.038 --> 13:20.572
A smudge or a partial print.

13:20.673 --> 13:24.347
Are Dr. Moten's,
uh, prints on file?

13:24.467 --> 13:25.377
Yeah.

13:25.478 --> 13:28.747
He was booked on a D.U.I.
five years ago, so, yeah.

13:28.848 --> 13:30.649
But just nine prints.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.351
So, that could be
Moten's finger.

13:32.419 --> 13:34.253
Yeah,
or someone else's entirely.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.654
I know my Uncle said

13:35.755 --> 13:38.223
James Notley had all his fingers
when he saw him,

13:38.324 --> 13:39.725
but Lucian and the truth...

13:39.826 --> 13:41.960
They have sort of an
on-and-off-again relationship.

13:42.062 --> 13:43.395
All right, then, Ferg...

13:43.496 --> 13:45.297
Uh, find out which funeral home

13:45.398 --> 13:47.266
James Notley's body
was sent to.

13:47.333 --> 13:49.868
See if the mortician
noticed any missing fingers.

15:09.352 --> 15:10.219
Hey.

15:10.287 --> 15:11.287
Hey.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.488
Trouble at home?

15:12.555 --> 15:15.391
Hey, Walt,
the mortician said

15:15.458 --> 15:19.261
that James Notley
had multiple stab wounds,

15:19.362 --> 15:21.330
but he still had all...

15:21.431 --> 15:22.531
of his fingers.

15:22.632 --> 15:24.800
Mortician say anything else?

15:24.901 --> 15:27.603
Yeah, that, uh,
Notley's funeral...

15:27.704 --> 15:29.238
Is in about an hour.

15:29.339 --> 15:31.807
Want to come to a funeral
with me?

15:31.908 --> 15:33.208
Might cheer you up.

15:33.276 --> 15:35.277
I'll take you up
on the next one.

15:38.181 --> 15:41.050
God entrusts us
with the miracle of life.

15:41.117 --> 15:44.453
Thus, we must trust
God's wisdom.

15:44.554 --> 15:47.356
We live in an imperfect world.

15:47.457 --> 15:48.757
We're tested.

15:48.825 --> 15:50.726
What are you doing here?

15:50.827 --> 15:53.195
Sheriffing.
What are you doing?

15:53.296 --> 15:55.631
Well, just burying
one more S.O.B.

15:55.732 --> 15:57.733
I'm happy to have outlived.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.302
Sometimes you've got to take
a moment to smell the roses.

16:00.370 --> 16:03.372
Is that James' girlfriend,
Connie Mallery?

16:03.473 --> 16:04.573
Yep.

16:04.641 --> 16:06.375
You planning on talking to her?

16:06.476 --> 16:08.577
Well...

16:08.645 --> 16:11.146
I need to find out
what she knows

16:11.214 --> 16:12.448
about James Notley

16:12.549 --> 16:14.717
and a possible partner of his.

16:14.818 --> 16:16.685
Walt, if Notley had a partner,

16:16.753 --> 16:19.088
I'd have smoked him out by now.

16:19.189 --> 16:20.789
Let's talk to Connie anyway.

16:20.890 --> 16:23.325
If you want her to talk,
don't take me.

16:23.393 --> 16:24.660
- Why?
- Notley claimed

16:24.761 --> 16:27.262
he was with Connie
the night of the robbery.

16:27.364 --> 16:29.732
When I... tricked her
into admitting otherwise,

16:29.833 --> 16:31.600
it busted his alibi,
put him in prison.

16:31.668 --> 16:35.304
All these long years later,
she still ain't talking to me.

16:38.842 --> 16:41.310
So, did Sheriff Connally
send you here?

16:41.378 --> 16:43.345
I've told that man for 20 years

16:43.446 --> 16:46.148
I don't know where James
hid the money, okay?

16:46.216 --> 16:47.417
I'm just trying to figure out

16:47.537 --> 16:49.379
what James
was trying to tell me.

16:49.732 --> 16:51.146
He, uh...

16:51.266 --> 16:53.756
He sent a safe deposit box
to my office,

16:53.857 --> 16:55.591
delivered after he died.

16:55.658 --> 16:57.092
What was in it?

16:57.193 --> 16:58.494
A finger.

16:58.595 --> 17:02.297
I don't know whose it is
or why James sent it to me.

17:02.399 --> 17:03.532
Do you?

17:03.633 --> 17:06.135
Oh, good Lord, no.

17:08.204 --> 17:11.173
Do you know
if James had a partner?

17:12.214 --> 17:14.409
If he did, he never told me.

17:14.529 --> 17:17.246
Did he ever mention
the name Tony Moten?

17:17.313 --> 17:21.550
Well, he was the guy
who was involved in the robbery,

17:21.651 --> 17:25.454
but James and I really never
talked about him.

17:25.555 --> 17:28.323
We only talked
about the future.

17:28.391 --> 17:31.460
But the last time,

17:31.561 --> 17:33.695
we barely talked at all.

17:33.763 --> 17:38.033
We got in this fight,
and I walked out.

17:38.134 --> 17:40.302
It was just so stupid.

17:41.771 --> 17:44.373
What did you fight about?

17:44.474 --> 17:46.442
You know, he was...

17:46.509 --> 17:50.512
He was this close
to getting released,

17:50.580 --> 17:53.048
and... he was miserable.

17:53.149 --> 17:55.551
He just kept getting
more and more paranoid

17:55.652 --> 17:58.687
and saying that he was never
gonna get of there alive

17:58.788 --> 18:01.156
that someone was
gonna screw him over.

18:01.224 --> 18:02.825
Did he say who?

18:02.926 --> 18:04.159
No.

18:05.595 --> 18:09.298
I, of course, thought
he was imagining things.

18:11.601 --> 18:16.104
This has always been
his favorite dress of mine.

18:16.206 --> 18:19.408
Been waiting 24 years to wear it again.

18:19.509 --> 18:23.245
I thought it'd be a happy day.

18:39.596 --> 18:42.698
Everything okay?

18:42.799 --> 18:45.434
Not really.

18:47.337 --> 18:49.505
You want to tell me
what's going on?

18:51.774 --> 18:54.309
I used to be a brunette.

19:00.850 --> 19:04.686
I dyed it blond
when we first moved here.

19:04.787 --> 19:08.757
And we didn't just move here
for Sean's work.

19:08.858 --> 19:13.385
We also moved here
for, uh, my protection.

19:16.499 --> 19:18.133
Why?

19:18.234 --> 19:21.169
Back in Philly,
at my old precinct,

19:21.237 --> 19:24.339
there was a cop
named Bobby Donolato.

19:24.440 --> 19:27.376
And he was caught up
in some, uh...

19:27.443 --> 19:29.311
some really dark stuff.

19:29.412 --> 19:32.175
So, I uh...
reported him.

19:32.295 --> 19:34.516
There was an investigation,

19:34.617 --> 19:38.086
and then Bobby blew his brains
out in his bathtub.

19:38.154 --> 19:41.123
Why didn't you tell me this
when you applied for the job?

19:41.224 --> 19:43.325
'Cause I didn't think
you'd hire me.

19:43.426 --> 19:44.593
Because you'd done
the right thing

19:44.694 --> 19:46.194
at your last job?

19:46.262 --> 19:48.297
Bobby's friends didn't think
it was the right thing.

19:48.398 --> 19:51.333
They blamed me for everything,

19:51.434 --> 19:54.136
especially Bobby's partner...

19:54.237 --> 19:55.771
Ed Gorski.

19:55.872 --> 19:58.473
You mean the ex-cop
who turned up a few weeks back?

19:58.541 --> 20:00.108
I could never prove it,

20:00.176 --> 20:02.744
but Ed started leaving
bullet casings in my locker,

20:02.812 --> 20:04.413
on my car.

20:04.514 --> 20:06.181
So, Sean...

20:06.249 --> 20:10.552
Started talking to his company
about a transfer.

20:10.620 --> 20:12.087
And we moved.

20:12.188 --> 20:14.590
Why are you
telling me this now?

20:14.691 --> 20:18.226
Because Ed's stalking me.

20:18.328 --> 20:22.097
He's broken into my car,
my house.

20:22.165 --> 20:24.199
Can you prove that?

20:24.267 --> 20:27.135
No.

20:27.236 --> 20:28.470
Has he threatened you?

20:28.538 --> 20:29.504
No.

20:29.606 --> 20:30.806
As you know,

20:30.907 --> 20:33.675
unless Ed
makes a direct threat,

20:33.776 --> 20:36.845
there's not much
legally can be done.

20:36.913 --> 20:39.648
Is Sean in town right now?

20:39.716 --> 20:40.682
No.

20:40.783 --> 20:42.618
Then don't go home tonight.

20:42.719 --> 20:46.188
You stay at my cabin
till we can figure this out.

20:46.289 --> 20:47.222
Okay.

20:49.892 --> 20:51.326
Walt... oh!

20:51.427 --> 20:54.363
Um, Hank Thompson
from the state prison

20:54.464 --> 20:56.264
is on the phone.

21:01.971 --> 21:03.672
What you got, Hank?

21:03.740 --> 21:05.774
One of our guys on the cleaning
crew found this letter.

21:05.875 --> 21:07.342
In James' cell?

21:07.443 --> 21:09.344
Yeah, penthouse suite.

21:09.445 --> 21:13.148
It was sticking out
of James' old mattress.

21:13.249 --> 21:15.117
Officially,
that's D.O.C. evidence,

21:15.184 --> 21:16.752
but they won't do squat
with it.

21:16.819 --> 21:18.286
I thought you'd want a copy

21:18.388 --> 21:20.088
before I gave it to them
to file away.

21:20.189 --> 21:21.556
- Appreciate it.
- You bet.

21:21.658 --> 21:25.494
James Notley had a partner
named Riley Manning.

21:25.561 --> 21:27.195
James' letter says
that if Riley

21:27.296 --> 21:29.498
denies being his partner,
just show him the finger.

21:29.565 --> 21:30.565
It's his.

21:30.633 --> 21:32.267
Letter also says

21:32.368 --> 21:34.336
that if Notley
is killed in prison,

21:34.437 --> 21:36.538
it's because, uh,
Riley found the money

21:36.639 --> 21:37.639
and had him killed.

21:37.740 --> 21:39.341
What do you want me to do?

21:39.442 --> 21:41.410
Letter says
that the money's hidden

21:41.477 --> 21:43.645
in an abandoned car
past mile marker 24.

21:43.746 --> 21:45.347
Go see if it's there.

21:45.448 --> 21:46.381
On my way.

21:46.482 --> 21:47.649
What about you?

21:47.750 --> 21:50.752
I'm going to the home
of Riley Manning.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.664
Well, it look like
we both we struck out...

21:57.765 --> 21:59.596
no Riley, no cash.

21:59.716 --> 22:01.578
The most likely explanation

22:01.698 --> 22:04.088
is that Riley Manning
has taken off with the money.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.171
One of his neighbors saw him

22:05.272 --> 22:07.006
loading his pickup in a hurry.

22:07.107 --> 22:09.108
We'll speak to Connie Mallery
tomorrow,

22:09.176 --> 22:10.583
see if she knows anything
about Riley

22:10.703 --> 22:13.361
- or where he might have gone.
- Okay. Sounds good.

22:13.481 --> 22:15.681
You sure you don't want to,
uh, switch spots?

22:15.749 --> 22:17.650
Um, I've spent many a night
on that couch.

22:17.751 --> 22:19.985
- It wouldn't put me out.
- No, that's okay. Thanks.

22:20.087 --> 22:22.555
Extra blankets are in the pantry
if you need them.

22:22.656 --> 22:23.589
Okay.

22:23.657 --> 22:24.824
Okay.

22:36.002 --> 22:37.503
Hello? Walt?

22:37.571 --> 22:39.605
I'm returning
that book I borrowed!

22:39.706 --> 22:41.140
I know it's late.
I guess...

22:41.208 --> 22:43.609
I was just in the neighborhood.

22:52.652 --> 22:55.187
Of course.

22:55.788 --> 22:58.190
It's the co-workers
you have to look out for.

22:58.291 --> 22:59.491
I guess my ex
was right after all.

22:59.592 --> 23:00.959
You spend
that much time together,

23:01.027 --> 23:01.652
something's bound to happen.

23:01.772 --> 23:03.154
Lizzie, this isn't
what it looks like.

23:03.274 --> 23:04.586
Don't pretend
to be embarrassed.

23:04.706 --> 23:06.565
Here, read it.

23:06.666 --> 23:10.902
You can't count on just being
young and willing forever.

23:11.004 --> 23:12.904
I'm married!

23:13.006 --> 23:15.407
When has that stopped anyone?

23:15.475 --> 23:17.509
I knew this was gonna happen eventually!

23:17.577 --> 23:21.046
I just thought you'd be man
enough to tell me when it did!

23:24.684 --> 23:26.251
What are you doing here?

23:26.319 --> 23:28.153
Making a fool of myself again.

23:28.221 --> 23:30.122
Pretending to return your book.

23:30.223 --> 23:31.923
- Lizzie, this...
- She already told me

23:32.025 --> 23:33.992
how it isn't
exactly what it looks like.

23:34.093 --> 23:36.294
What a strange love rectangle
you've got going.

23:36.396 --> 23:38.597
- Excuse me?
- Well, as I'm sure you have not noticed,

23:38.665 --> 23:40.421
I really like you.

23:40.541 --> 23:42.668
But you're still in love
with your dead wife!

23:42.769 --> 23:44.569
And I was willing
to live with that,

23:44.671 --> 23:47.472
because I thought there was
a part of you set aside for me!

23:47.573 --> 23:49.474
But there's not, because
you're saving it for her!

23:49.575 --> 23:53.545
Lizzie, there's nothing going on
between me and Vic.

23:53.646 --> 23:54.680
Nothing.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.081
Oh, Walt.

23:56.182 --> 23:57.649
Of course there is.

23:57.750 --> 24:00.952
You're just too afraid
to admit it.

24:27.413 --> 24:30.515
Still no word
on Riley Manning's whereabouts?

24:30.616 --> 24:34.519
Vic and Ferg are coordinating
a search for Manning's truck,

24:34.587 --> 24:35.954
a silver pickup,

24:36.055 --> 24:38.356
either no plates
or stolen plates.

24:38.424 --> 24:41.226
Ruby sent an A.P.B.
to the highway patrol.

24:43.196 --> 24:46.131
You mean Riley Manning
was James' partner?

24:46.232 --> 24:49.267
I mean,
they <i>were</i> friends, but...

24:49.335 --> 24:50.502
Riley?

24:50.603 --> 24:52.471
What gives you that idea?

24:52.572 --> 24:56.074
Is Riley missing a finger
on either hand?

24:56.142 --> 24:59.911
Actually, yeah.
On his right hand.

24:59.979 --> 25:01.246
Oh, my God.

25:01.347 --> 25:03.882
I can't believe
I didn't think of that before.

25:04.002 --> 25:07.853
Wait. So, was it Riley's finger
in that box you received?

25:07.954 --> 25:08.987
We think so.

25:09.055 --> 25:11.135
James left a letter
in his cell.

25:11.255 --> 25:13.152
That's why we think
Riley was his partner.

25:13.272 --> 25:13.840
Wow.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.994
When's the last time
you saw Riley?

25:16.062 --> 25:17.329
I used to see him every month.

25:17.430 --> 25:19.431
He'd come by and get a haircut.

25:19.532 --> 25:21.333
He was always between jobs,

25:21.434 --> 25:23.168
and he was James' friend,

25:23.236 --> 25:24.723
so I wouldn't charge him.

25:24.843 --> 25:27.409
But then he just stopped
coming over.

25:27.529 --> 25:28.664
When?

25:28.784 --> 25:31.243
Um, this last winter.

25:31.344 --> 25:35.009
I think the last time
I saw Riley

25:35.129 --> 25:37.516
was about three months ago.

25:37.617 --> 25:39.651
I was hiking
out by Lake Desmet,

25:39.719 --> 25:42.954
and he nearly caused me
to jump out of my sneakers.

25:44.017 --> 25:44.586
Why?

25:44.706 --> 25:47.626
Well, he shouted at me
from the lake.

25:47.727 --> 25:50.362
He was piloting this,
like, 30-foot sailboat.

25:52.064 --> 25:55.066
So, how does a guy
who can't afford a haircut

25:55.168 --> 25:56.935
end up with a sailboat?

25:57.036 --> 25:58.136
I don't know.

25:58.237 --> 26:01.039
Some guys are just lucky,
I guess.

26:01.140 --> 26:03.542
Thanks for your time.

26:03.609 --> 26:05.677
Of course.

26:21.363 --> 26:24.047
- Man, I was going the speed limit.
- I know.

26:24.167 --> 26:25.430
I got an A.P.B. out
on a silver pickup,

26:25.531 --> 26:27.465
so I need to see
your driver's license

26:27.566 --> 26:31.035
and your registration.

26:39.678 --> 26:41.980
Is your father
named Riley Manning?

26:42.081 --> 26:44.616
I don't know.
I never met my daddy.

26:44.717 --> 26:48.553
Look, I really can't afford
to pay for a ticket right now.

26:48.654 --> 26:52.624
So, is there anything
I can do to get out of it?

26:54.126 --> 26:56.066
Well, this is actually
my neighbor's truck.

26:56.186 --> 26:57.621
And, uh...

26:58.204 --> 27:00.398
I don't think
it's registered, so...

27:00.499 --> 27:02.934
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

27:32.464 --> 27:34.499
Those plates are stolen.

27:49.581 --> 27:50.915
Riley Manning!

27:51.016 --> 27:54.519
Raise up your arms
and step slowly out of the car!

27:58.424 --> 28:00.725
So, you didn't even follow him?

28:03.429 --> 28:05.797
Ferg, what happened?

28:05.864 --> 28:08.433
Look, I knew I couldn't
stall the suspect long enough

28:08.500 --> 28:09.734
for backup to arrive.

28:09.835 --> 28:11.736
I figured
he was armed and dangerous.

28:11.837 --> 28:13.271
So, I approached the truck.

28:13.339 --> 28:14.472
I addressed him by his name,

28:14.573 --> 28:15.563
and he sped off.

28:15.683 --> 28:17.047
Yeah, of course he did.

28:17.167 --> 28:20.478
But not until after
I dropped my watch

28:20.579 --> 28:22.513
into the bed of his pickup.

28:22.614 --> 28:24.682
It's a digital watch...

28:24.783 --> 28:26.551
With built-in GPS...

28:26.652 --> 28:31.522
Which means we can track
Riley Manning wherever he goes.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.465
Riley Manning?

28:40.566 --> 28:44.402
We have something of yours.

28:44.503 --> 28:47.338
So, aren't you curious

28:47.439 --> 28:49.841
how I got hold of your finger?

28:49.942 --> 28:52.577
What makes you think it's mine?

28:52.678 --> 28:55.613
Your partner told me.

28:55.714 --> 28:56.848
Before he was murdered,

28:56.949 --> 28:58.816
James Notley
took it upon himself

28:58.884 --> 29:00.985
to bequeath that finger
to my department.

29:01.053 --> 29:04.026
It seems to have something to do
with a Triceratops skeleton

29:04.146 --> 29:08.426
the two of you stole
and sold off back in 1989.

29:08.527 --> 29:11.286
Some dinosaur bones?
You've got the wrong guy.

29:11.406 --> 29:13.398
Tell James that.

29:13.499 --> 29:16.434
"My confession in 1989
was incomplete.

29:16.535 --> 29:19.637
"I never named my partner,
Riley Manning,

29:19.705 --> 29:23.241
"who helped me plan the heist,
drove the van,

29:23.342 --> 29:26.444
and kept watch
as the bones were loaded."

29:26.545 --> 29:29.881
That's damning testimony...

29:29.982 --> 29:33.351
armed robbery and murder.

29:33.452 --> 29:35.553
Nobody died during that heist.

29:35.621 --> 29:37.722
I'm not talking
about Tony Moten.

29:37.790 --> 29:39.424
I'm talking about James.

29:39.525 --> 29:43.261
"I have reason to believe
Riley has recently found out

29:43.362 --> 29:45.029
"where I hid the 840 grand.

29:45.130 --> 29:48.433
"If this is true,
I fully expect to be killed

29:48.534 --> 29:49.834
before I am released."

29:49.902 --> 29:51.803
Whoa. Whoa.
Wait now. I...

29:51.904 --> 29:53.604
I might have been involved

29:53.705 --> 29:55.973
in a few robberies
a long time ago,

29:56.074 --> 29:57.942
but I never killed anyone.

29:58.043 --> 30:00.812
And I sure as hell
wouldn't turn on James.

30:00.913 --> 30:02.880
He was my partner.

30:04.950 --> 30:07.418
Most guys would've sold out
their partner,

30:07.519 --> 30:09.720
plea-bargained
for a lesser sentence.

30:09.822 --> 30:11.622
Not James.

30:11.723 --> 30:13.891
He did the time. And when
he got out, he got the money.

30:13.992 --> 30:14.992
That was the deal.

30:15.093 --> 30:16.828
So, why'd he have your finger?

30:16.895 --> 30:18.729
I got 10% of the money
up front.

30:18.831 --> 30:19.964
James got the rest.

30:20.065 --> 30:21.933
But he was going away
for a long time.

30:22.000 --> 30:25.636
I wanted to prove to him
he could trust me.

30:25.737 --> 30:27.572
So I pulled out a knife,

30:27.639 --> 30:31.075
and I gave him 10%
of the fingers on my hand.

30:31.176 --> 30:32.777
Where's what money right now?

30:32.878 --> 30:34.479
Wherever James put it.

30:34.546 --> 30:36.547
This letter says he hid it

30:36.648 --> 30:38.048
in the trunk
of an abandoned car.

30:38.168 --> 30:40.823
We checked that car.
It's gone.

30:40.943 --> 30:42.987
Well, that sucks.

30:43.088 --> 30:45.957
But I don't know where it's at.

30:46.058 --> 30:48.459
I might be tempted
to believe that

30:48.560 --> 30:50.828
if you didn't split
from your house

30:50.929 --> 30:52.964
and speed away from my deputy.

30:53.065 --> 30:56.534
If you had nothing to do
with James' murder, why run?

30:56.635 --> 30:59.437
James' girl warned me.

30:59.538 --> 31:01.372
Connie called,

31:01.473 --> 31:03.307
said I should probably
lay low for a while,

31:03.375 --> 31:04.842
that the sheriff
was on my trail.

31:04.910 --> 31:07.612
She's never forgiven herself
for getting James arrested.

31:07.713 --> 31:09.814
I guess she doesn't
want to feel responsible

31:09.915 --> 31:10.948
for my arrest, as well.

31:13.785 --> 31:16.420
Me and James
were like brothers.

31:16.522 --> 31:17.688
So, why'd he write this letter?

31:17.789 --> 31:18.923
He didn't.

31:21.026 --> 31:25.599
I'll bet you
old Sheriff Connally

31:25.719 --> 31:29.549
blackmailed James into giving up
the location of the money

31:29.669 --> 31:32.748
and then pulled strings
to have him killed behind bars

31:32.868 --> 31:36.256
and then planted that letter
to set me up.

31:36.376 --> 31:38.509
What makes you think
Lucian would do that?

31:38.610 --> 31:39.744
His nature.

31:39.845 --> 31:41.946
I mean, he stole James' girl
20 years ago.

31:42.014 --> 31:43.814
Why not steal his money, too?

31:43.916 --> 31:46.517
Lucian had a relationship
with Connie Mallery?

31:46.618 --> 31:48.419
That's a polite way
of putting it.

31:48.520 --> 31:50.721
Sheriff Connally pounced on her

31:50.822 --> 31:52.890
the second he put James
behind bars.

31:52.991 --> 31:56.027
You owe me a beer.

32:00.685 --> 32:04.101
The heart is like a horse that
you can break, but never ride.

32:04.221 --> 32:06.279
The heart is like a horse...

32:06.990 --> 32:08.154
That you can break...

32:08.274 --> 32:08.914
We need to talk.

32:09.034 --> 32:11.035
About what?!
I'm practicing art here!

32:11.211 --> 32:13.579
About your relationship
with Connie Mallery.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.648
You can lead the horse
to jagged cliffs

32:15.716 --> 32:17.883
and force it to peer
into the great divide.

32:17.985 --> 32:20.218
- Stick to prose.
- Oh, come on, Walt.

32:20.338 --> 32:21.887
You can't take poor Connie
at her word.

32:21.989 --> 32:23.006
The girl is grieving still.

32:23.126 --> 32:24.385
She's gonna come
a little unwound.

32:24.505 --> 32:25.710
I didn't hear it from Connie.

32:25.830 --> 32:27.301
I heard it from Riley Manning.

32:27.421 --> 32:28.466
Riley Manning.

32:28.586 --> 32:29.420
Now, who in the hell
would that be?

32:29.540 --> 32:32.498
That'd be
James Notley's partner.

32:32.599 --> 32:34.864
Ever since I looked into
James Notley's murder,

32:34.984 --> 32:36.118
you've been lying to me.

32:36.238 --> 32:37.831
There are now accusations
that you're the one

32:37.951 --> 32:39.492
- behind the murder.
- Okay, Walt.

32:39.612 --> 32:41.807
Okay! You win!

32:41.908 --> 32:43.476
I'm not like you!

32:43.543 --> 32:44.977
I'm not perfect!

32:45.078 --> 32:47.913
I've actually made
a few damn mistakes in my life!

32:47.981 --> 32:49.615
Well, what are we
talking about...

32:49.716 --> 32:51.517
Chopping off fingers,
sleeping with a witness,

32:51.618 --> 32:52.852
or having a man killed?

32:52.953 --> 32:54.086
Look, every one of those

32:54.187 --> 32:55.888
fingerless pissants
had it coming.

32:55.989 --> 32:58.357
But that don't make me
a murderer, just a man.

32:58.458 --> 33:00.893
So, you <i>did</i> have a relationship
with Connie.

33:06.354 --> 33:10.503
Oh. Well...

33:10.604 --> 33:12.752
For a while, I did.

33:12.872 --> 33:16.842
She was scared and needed
somebody to protect her.

33:16.910 --> 33:18.943
And if you think
she's pretty now,

33:19.063 --> 33:21.082
you should've seen her
20 years ago.

33:21.647 --> 33:24.784
Looking back,
you might say I...

33:24.885 --> 33:26.189
took advantage
of the situation.

33:26.309 --> 33:27.497
But I don't regret it.

33:28.989 --> 33:32.458
We brought Riley Manning in.
He was on the run.

33:32.559 --> 33:34.760
He said Connie tipped him off.

33:34.828 --> 33:37.829
Did you give her any details
about this investigation?

33:37.949 --> 33:40.661
No. Now, why the hell
would you think that, Walt?

33:40.781 --> 33:43.117
Because Connie
warned Riley Manning

33:43.237 --> 33:46.005
before I even told her
we were looking for him.

33:54.915 --> 33:58.718
Connie, it's Sheriff Longmire.
We need to talk.

34:07.427 --> 34:08.661
Connie?!

34:08.728 --> 34:12.063
I need you to come down
to the station!

34:17.492 --> 34:20.090
And, Hank, since you're off duty
from the prison,

34:20.210 --> 34:21.841
why don't you come with us?

34:23.009 --> 34:25.215
So, why am I here?

34:25.335 --> 34:27.059
I thought you said
that James' letter

34:27.179 --> 34:28.507
named Riley as his killer.

34:28.628 --> 34:31.384
Aren't you arresting <i>him</i>
<i>for James' murder?</i>

34:31.485 --> 34:34.453
Riley's four months behind
on his pickup payment.

34:34.554 --> 34:36.422
His mortgage is upside down.

34:36.523 --> 34:38.958
He certainly
doesn't own a sailboat.

34:39.025 --> 34:41.927
In fact, Riley's never had
much money at all.

34:42.027 --> 34:44.929
Which means he's never really
had a reason to kill James.

34:45.031 --> 34:47.433
Oh, my God.

34:47.534 --> 34:48.734
Ohh.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.609
I'm...

34:56.710 --> 34:58.878
I'm afraid to say it,

34:58.979 --> 35:01.514
but...

35:01.615 --> 35:02.882
What if...

35:02.983 --> 35:05.451
What if it was Hank?

35:05.552 --> 35:07.920
I mean, you know that he works
at the prison.

35:08.021 --> 35:09.650
That's how we met
in the first place.

35:09.770 --> 35:12.814
What if Hank was afraid
that I'd go back to James

35:12.934 --> 35:14.846
once he was released?

35:16.563 --> 35:19.632
How long have you and Hank
been seeing each other?

35:19.733 --> 35:22.635
Well, I mean, not long.
You know?

35:24.037 --> 35:27.006
I mean, for years
I was faithful, but...

35:27.107 --> 35:29.575
You think Hank
is capable of murder?

35:29.676 --> 35:31.076
You know, he told me

35:31.178 --> 35:33.747
that he wouldn't want to live
without me.

35:33.867 --> 35:34.914
I just...

35:35.034 --> 35:37.441
you know, I just thought that
he was just being sweet, but...

35:38.777 --> 35:42.298
Hank's got this jealous streak.

35:42.418 --> 35:43.707
And his temper...

35:43.808 --> 35:45.775
if he was angry...

35:45.876 --> 35:47.811
yeah, I think
he could've killed James.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.013
Would you be willing
to say that in court?

35:50.081 --> 35:51.615
I don't know.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.184
When Hank gets angry,
it can get...

35:54.285 --> 35:57.053
pretty scary.

36:00.424 --> 36:02.558
I just talked to Connie.

36:03.009 --> 36:04.543
What'd she say?

36:04.644 --> 36:05.978
This.

36:06.046 --> 36:09.081
<i>Hank's got</i>
<i>this jealous streak.</i>

36:09.182 --> 36:10.950
<i>And his temper...</i>

36:11.051 --> 36:12.718
<i>If he was angry...</i>

36:12.819 --> 36:15.129
<i>Yeah, I think</i>
<i>he could've killed James.</i>

36:18.151 --> 36:19.925
I can't believe it.

36:20.026 --> 36:21.360
Believe what?

36:21.461 --> 36:23.395
That she would talk about me
like that.

36:23.497 --> 36:24.830
I never laid a hand on her.

36:24.931 --> 36:27.433
James was the abuser, not me.

36:27.501 --> 36:28.834
Connie said she was afraid

36:28.935 --> 36:31.504
that James would go crazy on her
when he got out.

36:31.605 --> 36:33.439
You were
supposed to protect her?

36:33.507 --> 36:35.207
Yeah.
What'd you do about that?

36:36.771 --> 36:38.744
I told psycho Carl

36:38.845 --> 36:42.414
that James was going around
calling him his bitch.

36:42.516 --> 36:43.849
Next thing you know,

36:43.950 --> 36:46.919
James was getting shanked
on the crapper.

36:47.020 --> 36:48.621
You did this
at Connie's request?

36:48.688 --> 36:49.688
Damn right I did,

36:49.789 --> 36:50.789
and on her dime.

36:50.857 --> 36:52.691
She paid me 15 grand.

36:52.792 --> 36:54.314
Where do you think Connie got
that kind of money from?

36:54.434 --> 36:57.329
Who knows?
I mean, her job?

36:57.430 --> 37:00.299
She's an occasional hairdresser,
works out of her house.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.368
So unless she got
a pretty big tip...

37:02.469 --> 37:04.737
Oh, shit.

37:04.838 --> 37:08.960
You mean Connie
has James' 800 grand?

37:09.080 --> 37:11.239
Did you forge that letter
you found in James' cell?

37:11.359 --> 37:12.317
I didn't have to.

37:12.437 --> 37:14.613
James wrote it himself
and gave it to me.

37:14.681 --> 37:16.062
Connie was telling him
about some friend

37:16.182 --> 37:17.476
that had been buying sailboats

37:17.596 --> 37:19.490
and taking vacations
in the Caribbean.

37:19.610 --> 37:22.454
All of a sudden, James starts
getting all paranoid

37:22.522 --> 37:24.890
- about this friend.
- Riley Manning.

37:24.958 --> 37:28.561
She was playing us
the whole time, wasn't she?

37:28.662 --> 37:31.597
She found James' money
and spent it.

37:33.667 --> 37:35.668
Come on.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.341
She had you kill James

37:42.442 --> 37:45.477
before he was released
and could figure it out.

37:55.889 --> 37:58.524
Connie, you can come out now.

38:07.534 --> 38:09.468
Connie, is there anything
you want to say to Hank?

38:09.536 --> 38:12.004
He's gonna be going away
for quite a while.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.873
I believe in mercy, sheriff.

38:14.975 --> 38:18.677
But anybody who did
what he did to James

38:18.778 --> 38:20.913
deserves whatever's coming.

38:20.981 --> 38:22.848
I couldn't agree more.

38:22.949 --> 38:25.017
Actually...

38:25.085 --> 38:26.685
it's this way.

38:26.786 --> 38:27.720
What...

38:27.787 --> 38:29.521
What are you doing?

38:29.623 --> 38:30.789
Arresting you...

38:30.890 --> 38:33.626
for conspiracy and murder.

38:33.727 --> 38:34.760
Wait.

38:34.861 --> 38:36.269
Hank told me the whole story.

38:36.389 --> 38:39.531
And, Connie,
for your own protection...

38:39.633 --> 38:41.834
I'd stay on that side
of the cell.

38:41.901 --> 38:43.435
Sheriff, I don't understand.

38:43.536 --> 38:44.737
Wait. What...

38:46.706 --> 38:48.974
<i>When Hank gets angry,</i>
<i>it can get...</i>

38:49.075 --> 38:51.644
<i>Pretty scary.</i>

38:51.711 --> 38:54.680
It's your move, Walt.

39:03.156 --> 39:06.058
You've been exposing your queen,

39:06.159 --> 39:10.062
hoping I'll rush in
and get myself trapped.

39:10.163 --> 39:13.365
The queen's gambit.

39:13.433 --> 39:17.069
I guess not everyone's
gonna fall for it.

39:17.170 --> 39:20.372
Like the horse has its rider,

39:20.440 --> 39:22.541
like the moon has its sky...

39:24.511 --> 39:28.080
So a man has his loneliness

39:28.181 --> 39:30.716
mistaken as pride.

39:48.101 --> 39:50.502
The sheriff is not here.

39:52.005 --> 39:54.006
I'm not looking for Walt.

39:54.107 --> 39:55.808
I'm looking for you.

39:57.544 --> 39:59.978
Can you keep a secret, Henry?

40:00.080 --> 40:02.915
I have been known
to keep one or two.

40:05.652 --> 40:09.755
That ex-boxer
from the Res

40:09.823 --> 40:11.857
who knocks
people's teeth out...

40:11.925 --> 40:13.459
what's his name?

40:15.462 --> 40:18.864
His name is Hector,
and he's a mercenary for hire,

40:18.932 --> 40:20.132
for the Cheyenne.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.012
Do you think
he'd ever do something

40:22.132 --> 40:24.493
for someone
who wasn't Cheyenne?

40:25.605 --> 40:27.406
What did you have in mind?

40:29.542 --> 40:31.543
Yeah?

40:31.644 --> 40:33.378
Walt, do you know
one of your deputies

40:33.480 --> 40:34.646
came to me to hire Hector?

40:34.748 --> 40:36.415
What did Vic want?

40:36.516 --> 40:42.921
For Hector to scare off
a man named Ed Gorski.

41:00.940 --> 41:02.841
Can I help you?

41:02.942 --> 41:06.078
"We men are wretched things."

41:06.179 --> 41:08.747
<i>We</i> are?

41:08.848 --> 41:09.982
Says who?

41:10.083 --> 41:11.483
Achilles.

41:11.584 --> 41:14.019
About 3,000 years ago.

41:14.120 --> 41:17.022
Read "The Iliad"?

41:17.123 --> 41:21.760
I'm familiar with the classics.

41:21.861 --> 41:24.096
But have you <i>read</i> it, Ed?

41:26.733 --> 41:28.667
Interpretations vary.

41:28.768 --> 41:33.438
I think it's a poem
about a man's destructive rage.

41:33.540 --> 41:36.842
Achilles was a warrior.

41:36.943 --> 41:40.479
He had a partner,
a fellow warrior.

41:40.580 --> 41:41.580
A friend.

41:41.681 --> 41:44.416
There's no greater enemy

41:44.484 --> 41:47.119
than the mortal enemy
of a friend.

41:47.220 --> 41:49.555
I would not disagree with that.

41:49.656 --> 41:52.457
So Achilles confronted
his friend's great enemy.

41:52.559 --> 41:55.828
Achilles gave the man
one warning...

41:55.929 --> 41:58.730
There is no weapon...

41:58.832 --> 42:01.600
No army that could protect
this enemy

42:01.668 --> 42:05.671
from the sheer hell
that is Achilles' rage.

42:07.774 --> 42:11.710
And what happened
to this enemy?

42:11.778 --> 42:14.780
Achilles ran his sword
through the man's guts

42:14.848 --> 42:17.749
and dragged his dead body
around the town.

42:18.818 --> 42:20.419
So...

42:20.486 --> 42:25.457
could this enemy have done
anything otherwise?

42:34.934 --> 42:37.669
He could have got out of town

42:37.770 --> 42:40.639
while he still had the chance.

42:53.539 --> 42:56.066
