WEBVTT

00:17.518 --> 00:19.387
6:15-- why is everybody
up already?

00:19.420 --> 00:20.754
At their age,

00:20.788 --> 00:22.756
they're probably
just happy they're up.

00:22.790 --> 00:23.791
( chuckles )

00:34.835 --> 00:37.037
( knocking )

00:37.838 --> 00:40.708
Henry? You hungry?

00:40.741 --> 00:43.244
Ma, how many times
do I have to tell you

00:43.277 --> 00:45.279
don't interrupt me
when I'm working?

00:45.313 --> 00:46.647
I'm making waffles.

00:46.680 --> 00:47.615
You can't work

00:47.648 --> 00:51.619
on an empty stomach.
It's not good for you!

00:51.652 --> 00:52.720
( knocking )

00:52.753 --> 00:54.222
DON:
Mrs. Korfelt.

00:54.255 --> 00:55.556
It's the FBI.
Open up.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.424
( door opens )

00:56.457 --> 00:58.726
MOTHER:
Couldn't you come back later?

00:58.759 --> 01:01.462
My son doesn't like to be
interrupted while he's working.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.563
We have a search
warrant.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.864
Ma'am, you're gonna have to open
the door right now.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.867
Henry!

01:06.900 --> 01:08.736
Smoke. I smell smoke.

01:08.769 --> 01:11.705
( smoke detector blares )

01:13.841 --> 01:15.343
Guys, he's running.
He's running.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.178
Copy. We're on our way.

01:26.854 --> 01:28.522
( tires screech )

01:29.790 --> 01:30.524
Turn off the engine!

01:33.594 --> 01:35.429
Now, put your hands back
on the wheel.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.730
Do it!

01:37.898 --> 01:39.533
Don't move.

01:39.567 --> 01:41.702
Step out of the car toward my
voice. Come on.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.840
What the hell
were you doing?

01:46.874 --> 01:48.776
Just making things a whole lot
worse for himself.

01:48.809 --> 01:49.843
is what
he was doing.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.546
Korfelt's facing a couple
of years for forgery.

01:52.580 --> 01:55.483
Why pull this stupid
stunt with the car?

01:55.516 --> 01:56.717
Maybe this is part
of the answer.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.319
Wasn't just making
passports.

01:58.352 --> 02:01.155
Car registrations, gun permits.

02:01.189 --> 02:03.491
Automobiles and weapons.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.759
You might want
to take a look at this.

02:11.732 --> 02:12.533
What is that? Code?

02:12.566 --> 02:14.768
I think I know
how we can find out.

02:18.539 --> 02:19.773
Again. Let's see.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.810
Okay, see?
What am I doing wrong here?

02:22.843 --> 02:23.777
I'm telling you, Larry.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.814
It's that 11th critical fold.
You keep...

02:26.847 --> 02:29.817
I know. I know.
I keep impinging

02:29.850 --> 02:30.818
upon my laminar
boundary layer.

02:30.851 --> 02:33.821
Right. Which results
in a high Reynolds number.

02:33.854 --> 02:36.224
I can't. No, I can't do this
anymore. I can't.

02:36.257 --> 02:37.825
Hey, hey. Don't get all
Fleinhardt on me.

02:37.858 --> 02:40.828
It's just the Physics Department
Paper Airplane Contest.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.230
Flein... Fleinhardt?

02:42.263 --> 02:43.564
Since when
did my last name become

02:43.597 --> 02:44.832
a predicate adjective?

02:44.865 --> 02:47.268
Since your students started
using it that way.

02:48.869 --> 02:49.837
Here's a different
design.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.539
Uh-huh.

02:51.572 --> 02:53.674
And it's much more forgiving in
the build phase.

02:53.707 --> 02:55.776
-Try that. Try that.
-Let me try this.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.814
Hey, Don.
What's going on?

03:00.848 --> 03:02.483
Just work, guys.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.584
Who made this?

03:03.617 --> 03:05.653
Me. Why?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.687
The wings are a little thin
here, buddy.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.821
Hey, wait, wait.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.856
Let me see this.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.358
CHARLIE:
Forgive me if all my years

03:10.391 --> 03:11.058
of advanced applied
mathematics

03:11.091 --> 03:13.394
take issue with that assessment.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.662
Yeah, well,
you'll forgive me

03:14.695 --> 03:16.497
if all my years of
high school detention

03:16.530 --> 03:17.365
say I'm right.
You go ahead.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.666
You make those wings
wider, it'll fly.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.501
What's going on?

03:20.534 --> 03:21.969
Some idiot tried
to run over

03:22.002 --> 03:23.837
one of my agents
this morning

03:23.871 --> 03:25.606
over what we thought
were fake passports.

03:25.639 --> 03:28.809
He left this.
So be careful.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.356
It's a transposition cipher.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.457
Can you break it?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.826
Yeah. I'll need some time.

03:45.859 --> 03:46.960
Well, how long?

03:46.994 --> 03:48.762
'Cause something's not sitting
right about it to me.

03:48.796 --> 03:52.333
Well, I can already tell you
the basic context of this

03:52.366 --> 03:53.634
and it's not about passports.

03:53.667 --> 03:54.968
What's it about?

03:55.002 --> 03:57.671
There are letter groupings here
that I've seen before

03:57.705 --> 03:58.906
when I consulted
for the NSA.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.442
-What?
-Standard code references

04:01.475 --> 04:03.711
for a very specific type
of operation.

04:03.744 --> 04:04.578
What kind of operation?

04:04.612 --> 04:08.982
Don, it's a plan
for an assassination.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.658
An assassination on U.S. soil?

04:50.691 --> 04:52.593
Yeah.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.428
Charlie, how can you be sure

04:54.462 --> 04:56.697
if you haven't decoded the rest
of Korfelt's book yet?

04:56.730 --> 04:57.565
Pattern recognition.

04:57.598 --> 04:59.367
Everybody here does it
all the time.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.702
I mean, you've all played
Scrabble, right?

05:01.735 --> 05:03.904
Your mind knows language.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.706
It sort of automatically
searches

05:05.739 --> 05:07.841
for groupings of letters that
makes sense to us

05:07.875 --> 05:09.042
that make a word.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.878
Well, my mind knows codes
and ciphers.

05:10.911 --> 05:12.680
I can't help but recognize
these patterns.

05:15.583 --> 05:16.717
These groupings
are abbreviations.

05:16.750 --> 05:17.985
They're not encrypted.

05:18.018 --> 05:19.587
Abbreviations for what?

05:19.620 --> 05:20.788
Types of killings.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.625
"Open. Secret. Lost. Safe."

05:24.658 --> 05:25.793
-Open?
-"Open,"

05:25.826 --> 05:28.429
if there's no need
to hide the murder.

05:28.462 --> 05:30.698
"Secret," if it has
to appear as an accident.

05:30.731 --> 05:31.765
You're sure about this?

05:31.799 --> 05:32.733
I mean, Korfelt hasn't even
started talking yet.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.935
I've worked with the National
Security Agency

05:34.968 --> 05:38.739
on intercepts
of actual covert communications.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.774
I checked these abbreviations
against my logs,

05:40.808 --> 05:43.010
and yeah, they're authentic.

05:43.043 --> 05:44.478
I've notified Washington.

05:44.512 --> 05:46.079
They just wanna know as
soon as there's

05:46.113 --> 05:48.382
a threat
to National Security.

05:48.416 --> 05:49.617
Well, Korfelt's involvement
suggests

05:49.650 --> 05:50.951
that the assassin isn't local.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.786
He needs a passport.

05:52.820 --> 05:54.121
So the killer needs to get
inside the country?

05:54.154 --> 05:56.457
Unless he's already here.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.898
So, uh,
what's this one about?

06:04.932 --> 06:06.867
Possible assassination.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.737
Assassination?
Who was killed?

06:09.770 --> 06:11.705
No one, as far
as we know.

06:11.739 --> 06:12.706
At least not yet.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.974
You know, when
it's done right,

06:14.007 --> 06:17.511
you never do find out
who did it.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.847
Kennedy, Dallas, '63.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.683
You're still waiting
for an answer on that one.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.884
Hmm.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.152
I suppose
this will take

06:25.185 --> 06:26.720
you the rest
of the week, huh?

06:26.754 --> 06:28.956
Pretty much. Yeah. Why?

06:28.989 --> 06:32.860
Uh, it's Aunt Irene's 80th
on the 27th.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.861
Aunt Irene hates you.

06:33.894 --> 06:36.697
No, she doesn't hate me.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.865
She was just a little
disappointed

06:37.898 --> 06:39.700
at your mother's choice
of a spouse.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.068
Yet you're still going.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.704
Well, she's still
your mother's aunt.

06:43.737 --> 06:46.774
Doesn't change just because
your mother's not here.

06:46.807 --> 06:48.876
Yeah, well,
I went to her 75th.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.678
She made me dance with her.

06:50.711 --> 06:53.013
A very slow dance.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.815
I really could use a wingman
on this one, Charlie.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.883
I'm sorry.

06:55.916 --> 06:58.051
Even if I could make the time,
I'm supposed to go

06:58.085 --> 06:59.920
to a concert
on the 27th.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.489
Why don't you
ask Don?

07:01.522 --> 07:02.623
No, Don's too busy.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.624
I'm busy, too.

07:03.657 --> 07:04.892
I didn't mean it
that way.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.226
Anyway, this is not about you.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.895
It's about me.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.897
Yeah.

07:14.668 --> 07:17.738
You do realize who has to dance
with her now.

07:21.942 --> 07:22.976
You assaulted a federal officer

07:23.010 --> 07:24.812
with a deadly weapon.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.647
It was a Volkswagen.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.249
You think it's funny?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.918
Hey, how's it going?

07:30.951 --> 07:31.919
Okay.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.687
So what does all your

07:33.721 --> 07:34.788
behavioral science training
tell you

07:34.822 --> 07:36.690
about a grown man who still
lives with his mother?

07:36.724 --> 07:38.626
Probably about the same

07:38.659 --> 07:40.728
as two brothers still moochin'
meals at their dad's house

07:40.761 --> 07:41.962
three nights a week.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.997
Hey, technically,
it's my brother's house.

07:44.031 --> 07:46.800
But, okay, Megan.
I see how it's gonna be.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.936
I just call 'em
like I see 'em.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.939
Uh-huh, all right.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.908
I don't know anything
about a murder.

07:57.911 --> 07:58.846
That's not gonna fly.

08:02.816 --> 08:03.951
We cracked your code.

08:03.984 --> 08:07.721
We know you provided documents
and vehicles

08:07.755 --> 08:09.723
and weapons to an assassin.

08:09.757 --> 08:11.692
You know, we don't need
to talk to him anymore.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.860
We should be talking
to his mother.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.027
It's her apartment, right?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.062
You can't do that.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.930
My mother has a heart condition.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.632
Well, then start telling us
what we want to know

08:18.666 --> 08:21.301
or think about a defibrillator
for mommy.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.104
He'll kill me.
Don't you understand?

08:26.607 --> 08:28.241
Look,

08:28.275 --> 08:31.645
Henry, I'm all you got.

08:34.882 --> 08:36.950
I don't know names.

08:36.984 --> 08:39.987
Only a code reference--
"Condor."

08:40.020 --> 08:41.254
And who's the target?

08:41.288 --> 08:43.657
He's a Colombian;
a kid, I think.

08:43.691 --> 08:46.994
His father was an activist
who got killed down there.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.129
Mm-hmm.

08:54.602 --> 08:57.204
Immigration list of registered
aliens from Colombia.

08:57.237 --> 09:00.941
Korfelt's description fits
Gabriel Ruiz, 24.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.342
He's a film student.
He seems clean.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.011
Why him?

09:04.044 --> 09:05.979
His dad, Raoul Ruiz.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.347
He was big in
the reform movement.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.882
He disappeared
three years ago

09:08.916 --> 09:10.651
with an older son,
Estevan.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.020
A month ago a crew digging
a highway bed

09:13.053 --> 09:14.822
uncovered the bodies.

09:14.855 --> 09:16.690
Think this kid knows who killed
his father and brother?

09:16.724 --> 09:17.625
Well, if he did,

09:17.658 --> 09:19.192
I think he'd have been dead
a long time ago.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.628
So why kill him now?

09:20.661 --> 09:22.062
Well, finding the bodies
was big news.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.865
Maybe it brought
the spotlight back.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.668
Yeah, right back onto the last
surviving son.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.909
You know,
even if I wanted to

09:35.943 --> 09:37.678
I can't go back.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.379
-No?
-No.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.915
After the murder
of my family,

09:41.949 --> 09:43.884
I was exiled by
the Colombian government.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.287
Exiled? For what reason?

09:47.320 --> 09:50.891
For being my
father's son.

09:50.924 --> 09:51.725
Doesn't really matter, though.

09:51.759 --> 09:53.761
I have no intention
of going back.

09:53.794 --> 09:55.929
Colombia holds nothing
for me anymore.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.365
What about what happened to your
father and brother?

09:58.398 --> 10:00.133
It's not a mystery,
Agent Eppes.

10:00.167 --> 10:03.336
The government's corrupted
by the cartels.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.272
They murder anyone
who goes against them:

10:05.305 --> 10:07.040
prosecutors, judges,

10:07.074 --> 10:10.911
reformers like my father
and my brother.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.748
And you never thought
about revenge?

10:14.782 --> 10:18.919
I was just 21 living in Bogota
when they were killed.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.188
My mother died
when I was young.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.791
I had no family,
no money.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.325
Whatever friends
my family had

10:25.358 --> 10:27.194
were frightened back
into their holes.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.062
Gabriel, is it possible
that whoever killed them

10:29.096 --> 10:31.198
thinks that for some reason
you pose a threat now?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.966
How?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.003
I'm a third-year film student,
who owns a small cafe.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.806
I loved my father
and my brother,

10:38.839 --> 10:40.140
but their country
isn't mine anymore.

10:45.278 --> 10:46.947
You know I talked
to my dad once

10:46.980 --> 10:49.950
about America when
I was applying to schools.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.686
Oh, yeah?

10:52.720 --> 10:54.054
He wanted me to get
an education here,

10:54.087 --> 10:56.223
but he warned me
that America

10:56.256 --> 10:57.858
could make you forget
where you come from.

11:01.862 --> 11:05.198
After that first night arriving
in Los Angeles,

11:05.232 --> 11:07.935
I prayed to God
that my father was right.

11:28.255 --> 11:30.457
-( door open )
-Hey.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.925
You still up for lunch?

11:31.959 --> 11:33.827
Yeah. Hey, I spoke
to my buddy.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.896
He says I can get those
tickets for the concert.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.464
-For the White Stripes.
-Hmm.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.366
Charlie, what
is all this?

11:39.399 --> 11:41.802
The methodology
of assassination.

11:41.835 --> 11:42.870
You have a lot
of variables here.

11:42.903 --> 11:46.006
I mean, isn't there any way
to narrow them down?

11:46.039 --> 11:49.743
Well, knowing how
the assassin intends

11:49.777 --> 11:52.012
to carry out the
killing would help.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.014
For instance, if he has to
make it look like an accident,

11:54.047 --> 11:56.083
that would limit his methods
and opportunities.

11:56.116 --> 11:59.419
Charlie, where did you learn all
this stuff about assassination?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.289
If I told you that,
I'd have to kill you.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.523
( laughs )

12:03.556 --> 12:04.958
Okay, seriously.

12:04.992 --> 12:06.927
Seriously.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.401
DON: What do you know about
something called Condor?

12:14.434 --> 12:18.505
I am an official
of the Colombian government,

12:18.538 --> 12:22.309
and it's not appropriate for me
to address certain topics.

12:22.342 --> 12:26.046
Counselor Benavides,
you think it's appropriate

12:26.079 --> 12:28.448
for your country to play out its
problems on the streets of L.A.?

12:30.583 --> 12:33.053
It's a protocol from the past.

12:33.086 --> 12:34.454
Operation Condor.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.058
A pact made in the '70s
by six South American nations

12:38.091 --> 12:40.527
to kill each other's
political enemies.

12:40.560 --> 12:44.998
It involves the use
of a highly-trained assassin.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.400
So why would a protocol
like that be taken out

12:47.434 --> 12:48.535
against Gabriel Ruiz?

12:48.568 --> 12:53.540
The name Ruiz is very powerful
in Colombian politics.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.508
It carries great hope,

12:55.542 --> 12:58.545
much like the name Kennedy
once carried.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.849
And just like John, Jr.,
who didn't want to go

13:01.882 --> 13:03.984
into politics
after his father was murdered,

13:04.017 --> 13:07.087
everyone expected that
sooner or later he would.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.257
So, kill him before he has
a chance to change his mind?

13:10.290 --> 13:14.828
An obvious murder would
cause an outcry in Colombia.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.897
So he'd have to make it
look like an accident?

13:18.899 --> 13:21.101
( door opens )

13:21.134 --> 13:22.235
Hey, Charlie.
Listen.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.937
We're thinking
Gabriel's assassination

13:23.971 --> 13:25.305
is going to look
like an accident.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.439
Awesome.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.976
That gives us a better chance
of winning this game.

13:29.009 --> 13:29.977
What game?

13:30.010 --> 13:31.578
CHARLIE:
Hide-and-seek.

13:31.611 --> 13:32.946
What are you
talking about,

13:32.980 --> 13:33.780
like the kid's
version?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.083
A mathematical approach to it,
yes.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.486
See, the assassin must hide in
order to accomplish his goal.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.154
We must seek and
find the assassin

13:41.188 --> 13:42.890
before he
achieves that goal.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.191
Ah, behavioral
game theory, yeah.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.893
We studied this
at Quantico.

13:45.926 --> 13:47.961
I doubt you studied it the way
that Rubinstein, Tversky

13:47.995 --> 13:50.263
and Heller studied
two-person, constant-sum

13:50.297 --> 13:52.900
hide-and-seek with unique
mixed strategy equilibria.

13:52.933 --> 13:53.967
No, not quite that way.

13:54.001 --> 13:55.002
DON:
Just bear with him.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.503
The concept's
simple.

13:56.536 --> 13:58.271
It's almost instinctive, but

13:58.305 --> 14:00.908
when an assassin has many
opportunities to hit his target,

14:00.941 --> 14:02.375
it gets complex.

14:02.409 --> 14:05.045
Imagine the game Battleship.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.980
Okay, it's essentially
a hide-and-seek game.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.983
Except let's say
the ships can be moved.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
One player tries
to get his ship

14:11.418 --> 14:13.086
on several squares
of opportunity

14:13.120 --> 14:14.922
before all his ships are found.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.358
Now, suppose that the player
hiding has limited options.

14:18.391 --> 14:21.328
He can only move one ship at
a time, one square at a time.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.330
That would give
the player seeking him

14:23.363 --> 14:25.966
the ability to calculate
his likely moves.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.005
So you're saying if we know
Condor's opportunities,

14:32.039 --> 14:33.406
we can predict the attacks.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.676
Not predict as much
as calculate the probabilities.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.046
If Condor has to make
this look like an accident,

14:39.079 --> 14:41.014
he can't use,
say a gun or a bomb.

14:41.048 --> 14:42.582
He has to avoid witnesses.

14:42.615 --> 14:44.451
He's limited.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.518
He's limited
by locations? Methods?

14:45.552 --> 14:47.220
That's right.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.022
How long will it take you to
come up with some probabilities?

14:49.056 --> 14:51.191
Soon. Of course
the accuracy will improve

14:51.224 --> 14:53.426
the more I know about
Condor's abilities.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.363
So, I think you should talk
to the man you arrested again.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.532
This is the U.S. Marshal
coming down. Open the gate.

14:59.566 --> 15:01.969
The van should be on the south
side of the building. Over.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.236
MAN ( over radio ):
Copy that.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.240
KORFELT:
Can we walk a little faster?

15:07.274 --> 15:09.376
-What's your rush?
-I'd just like to get to prison

15:09.409 --> 15:10.543
-as soon as possible.
-( gunshot )

15:10.577 --> 15:20.620
OFFICER:
Hold it right there!

15:20.620 --> 15:27.160
OFFICER:
Hold it right there!

15:27.194 --> 15:30.630
( garbled police radio
transmission, clamoring )

15:47.314 --> 15:49.282
OFFICER:
One-L-ten. We're a code four.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.717
RADIO DISPATCHER:
Copy that, one-L-ten.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.455
No evidence of the sniper
set up anywhere.

15:55.488 --> 15:56.323
COLBY:
It's a type-four flak jacket.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.457
It should stop
the high-velocity round.

15:57.490 --> 15:58.291
But this thing went right
through the trauma plate.

15:58.325 --> 15:58.825
That's a .308 caliber
tungsten bullet.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.693
Not the kind of thing

16:00.727 --> 16:01.428
we're gonna find
at the corner gun store.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.162
No one knew
about the move?

16:02.195 --> 16:02.962
I mean, not even
the jail staff?

16:02.996 --> 16:03.396
Shooter must've been
waiting for him.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.397
All right, look.

16:04.431 --> 16:06.566
If we're saying that
Korfelt was supplying Condor

16:06.599 --> 16:07.334
with everything from
documents to weapons,

16:07.367 --> 16:08.301
then we should
be running down

16:08.335 --> 16:09.369
every single name in
that code book. Okay?

16:09.402 --> 16:09.736
I want to get someone on
that kid Gabriel Ruiz today.

16:09.769 --> 16:11.604
You got it.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.272
How'd you come by
all this hard data

16:12.305 --> 16:12.905
on assassination techniques?

16:12.939 --> 16:13.806
I have a friend
at the NSA

16:13.840 --> 16:14.441
who has a friend at the...
at the CIA.

16:14.474 --> 16:15.075
Yeah, don't even tell me.

16:15.108 --> 16:16.909
You know what's interesting?

16:16.943 --> 16:17.810
When a death must
look accidental,

16:17.844 --> 16:18.978
we automatically
reject modern weapons

16:19.012 --> 16:19.946
in favor methods that have been
around thousands of years.

16:19.979 --> 16:20.947
Drowning. Smothering.
Blow to the noggin.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.451
I think we have to give
value to defenestration.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.753
What's...
what's "defenestration"?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.355
( chuckling ):
Charles, come on.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.356
When I was an undergrad,

16:29.389 --> 16:31.791
even math and science majors
had to have English.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.093
I took English, Larry.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.527
I didn't memorize
the dictionary.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.464
Okay, well, the ideal
of the Renaissance Man--

16:37.497 --> 16:40.100
it's just still
a goal with me.

16:40.133 --> 16:43.103
Defenestraton is...

16:43.136 --> 16:45.305
the act of throwing something
out the window.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.706
Oh, I've got that covered.

16:46.739 --> 16:49.109
In fact, the most effective
method of killing a man

16:49.142 --> 16:50.510
is to drop him
onto a hard surface

16:50.543 --> 16:52.145
from a height
of at least 75 feet.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.546
It works every time.

16:53.580 --> 16:55.715
Yeah, but does your subject
often stand by high windows?

16:55.748 --> 16:57.550
I have no idea.

16:57.584 --> 16:59.586
And I see you have
his schedule here.

16:59.619 --> 17:01.088
But do you know if he
jaywalks in traffic?

17:01.121 --> 17:02.789
Attempts home repairs?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.125
I get it, I get it. I should be
aware of all the opportunities

17:05.158 --> 17:06.393
that Gabriel Ruiz might present.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.795
Well, yeah, or you don't
have all the data.

17:08.828 --> 17:10.463
I have to actually talk to him.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.432
Yeah, it's field work.
It's just field work.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.601
There's no substitute.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.670
So Korfelt's got no activity
on his credit cards

17:17.704 --> 17:19.339
for the last three weeks.

17:19.372 --> 17:20.807
Yeah, he was laying low.

17:20.840 --> 17:22.409
There's gotta be something.

17:22.442 --> 17:23.710
Yeah.

17:28.181 --> 17:31.151
Rumor has it you
got an eyeful in Afghanistan.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.120
It wasn't so bad, you know.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.256
College degree kept me
off the front line and all.

17:36.289 --> 17:37.657
That's why you joined
the Bureau?

17:37.690 --> 17:38.758
Want to get some action?

17:38.791 --> 17:40.160
What else was I gonna do with

17:40.193 --> 17:41.728
three years
of interrogation techniques?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.163
Wait a minute.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.164
Korfelt's mom.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.265
We ran her credit cards, right?

17:45.298 --> 17:47.134
Yeah, it should be
in that package.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.740
Bingo. Used at a bookstore
on Melrose.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.442
Five times
in the last two weeks.

17:55.475 --> 17:57.644
What's the address?

17:57.677 --> 18:00.313
6-2-1-5 Melrose Avenue.

18:00.347 --> 18:01.881
Look at that.
It's only a couple of blocks

18:01.914 --> 18:04.184
from the Colombian Consulate.

18:04.217 --> 18:06.186
I wonder if he had
a contact there.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.188
Let's get a list of
Consulate employees.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.323
See if Ruiz recognizes
any names connected

18:10.357 --> 18:11.824
to the murder of his family.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.360
Yeah. Will do.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.861
Look, I'd feel
more comfortable

18:14.894 --> 18:17.497
if someone else got Gabriel's
schedule. All right?

18:17.530 --> 18:18.865
Well, that's
not as effective.

18:18.898 --> 18:20.467
See, I need to work
the data against

18:20.500 --> 18:22.435
the risk/success scenarios
that I've established.

18:22.469 --> 18:23.870
I have very specific
questions, Don.

18:23.903 --> 18:25.838
-Besides, with a secret
assassination, -All right.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.774
-the odds of an attack are less
likely -All right.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.609
when the target is in
the company of others.

18:29.642 --> 18:30.877
All right, all right.
I'll set it up.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.612
But I'm gonna have
an agent with you, okay?

18:32.645 --> 18:34.147
I mean, I gotta answer
to Dad about this.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.482
Yeah, well...

18:35.515 --> 18:37.317
somehow you managed
to escape an invite

18:37.350 --> 18:38.885
to Aunt Irene's 80th
birthday party.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.387
-What?
-Lucky you, huh?

18:40.420 --> 18:41.388
Yeah, Dad invited me.

18:41.421 --> 18:43.890
He didn't even bother
asking you because...

18:43.923 --> 18:45.625
well, because
you're working.

18:45.658 --> 18:46.693
Well, I'm in the
middle of a case.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.628
Yeah, you're always in
the middle of a case. So?

18:48.661 --> 18:50.230
Hey, don't... Charlie,
I've done my share.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.231
Yeah, I live with him.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.165
Well, that's your choice.

18:52.199 --> 18:54.301
Don, I can't go.

18:54.334 --> 18:56.236
I have concert tickets
for that night.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.270
It's for me and Amita.

18:57.304 --> 19:00.740
Charlie, well, I've got to
find an assassin, okay?

19:00.773 --> 19:02.442
So assassin, concert.
Concert, assassin.

19:02.475 --> 19:03.276
You tell me.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.245
I don't know why
everything always

19:05.278 --> 19:06.813
has to fall on
my shoulders.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.381
-What are you talking about?
-Dad doesn't want to go alone.

19:08.415 --> 19:09.682
Think about it.

19:21.628 --> 19:24.931
I'm not sure I really understand
why all this is necessary.

19:24.964 --> 19:27.400
I thought it was
explained to you.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.968
Well, they told me
there was a chance

19:29.001 --> 19:30.603
someone might want
to harm me.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.672
But I told them
there was no reason to.

19:32.705 --> 19:33.606
Now you show up--

19:33.640 --> 19:35.742
some kind of a...
assassination specialist.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.910
I'm a mathematician, actually.

19:37.944 --> 19:39.346
-Mathematician?
-Mm-hmm.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.580
I consult for the FBI.

19:40.613 --> 19:43.583
I'm here to try to get some
parameters of your movements.

19:43.616 --> 19:44.784
Your daily routine.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.886
Where you go and
how you get there.

19:46.919 --> 19:48.221
You're studying
film, right?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.923
Yes, and I own
a small cafe.

19:52.959 --> 19:53.993
What?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928
Does your cafe
have airtight

19:55.962 --> 19:57.964
walk-in refrigerators
or freezers?

19:57.997 --> 19:59.232
Yes.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.601
You need to avoid
those-- problematic.

20:01.634 --> 20:05.705
I also need to list your hobbies
and regular activities.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.006
I like hiking.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.242
Hiking could also
be problematic.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.344
It's easy to
stage an injury

20:11.378 --> 20:14.847
or leave the person alone
to die of exposure.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.983
Also, during
certain seasons,

20:17.016 --> 20:18.751
hunting accidents.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.656
Someone really is trying
to kill me?

20:30.062 --> 20:33.566
Eppes-- that was the same name
the other agent had.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.568
We're brothers.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.538
You don't worry about him?

20:38.571 --> 20:40.673
With his job at the FBI?

20:40.707 --> 20:44.544
I guess I just don't
think about it that much.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.013
Neither did I.

20:47.046 --> 20:49.816
I was a youngster.

20:49.849 --> 20:52.952
My brother always tried
to keep me away from the work.

20:52.985 --> 20:56.523
I heard about what happened
to your family.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.957
I'm very sorry.

20:57.990 --> 21:03.430
Okay. Well...
what about driving?

21:03.463 --> 21:05.031
Or just even walking
down the street?

21:05.064 --> 21:06.299
Driving would be better.

21:06.333 --> 21:10.437
A staged vehicle accident often
results in injury but not death.

21:10.470 --> 21:14.006
So you're saying that there's
no way to keep myself safe.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.442
You should be taking
precautions.

21:15.475 --> 21:18.478
Like what? Like not walking?
Not working?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.848
I don't want this.

21:21.881 --> 21:22.715
Any of it.

21:22.749 --> 21:24.484
So you just tell
whoever is behind this

21:24.517 --> 21:25.918
that I want nothing
to do with it.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.286
Nothing.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.365
I looked at the perimeters
you gave me.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.299
Should prove to be
very useful.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.971
Well, they're more than
perimeters, though, aren't they?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.706
I mean, what we're really
looking at here

21:46.739 --> 21:49.476
is all the ways Gabriel Ruiz
might die in the next few days.

21:49.509 --> 21:52.111
Come on, your work didn't
create this assassin.

21:52.144 --> 21:56.115
No, but until Gabriel
spoke to me he had hope.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.018
Well, research can't be
performed in a vacuum.

21:59.051 --> 22:02.021
I mean, the subject will be
changed by the process.

22:02.054 --> 22:05.858
It's just hard to look somebody
in the eye and tell them

22:05.892 --> 22:07.994
there's a strong probability
they're going to be murdered.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.762
Oh, yeah.

22:09.796 --> 22:11.798
But would you rather
less involvement

22:11.831 --> 22:13.099
or a more accurate result?

22:13.132 --> 22:15.034
ALAN: I thought I heard
somebody back here.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.103
Larry.

22:17.136 --> 22:18.505
So what are you guys doing?

22:18.538 --> 22:19.772
Still working on Don's case?

22:19.806 --> 22:22.008
A difficult problem.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.242
Don's very lucky to have

22:23.275 --> 22:25.878
two of the most brilliant minds
of Los Angeles helping him.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.814
It's not really
the math that's proving

22:27.847 --> 22:28.881
so difficult here.

22:28.915 --> 22:30.683
It's encountering
the human stakes.

22:30.717 --> 22:33.453
Charlie?

22:35.555 --> 22:39.726
I never realized how hard
it must be for Don.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.528
It's not easy
what he does, is it?

22:41.561 --> 22:45.064
Uh, no.
No, it's not.

22:45.097 --> 22:47.066
Did you ever try
to talk him out of

22:47.099 --> 22:48.501
doing that kind of work?

22:48.535 --> 22:52.572
We are talking about Don, right?

22:54.574 --> 22:58.745
See, Charlie, the thing about
kids is that, um,

22:58.778 --> 23:00.947
you can't make them into
what you want.

23:00.980 --> 23:04.050
You can teach them
values, character

23:04.083 --> 23:05.918
and a little common sense.

23:05.952 --> 23:09.922
But then you have to let go.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.924
You have to let them
become the man or woman

23:11.958 --> 23:13.192
that they're intended to be.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.896
That doesn't sound easy, either.

23:16.929 --> 23:20.399
No, believe me. It's not.

23:28.841 --> 23:32.211
Agent Sinclair here
for Gabriel Ruiz.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.946
He's inside.

23:33.980 --> 23:35.147
Is Charles Eppes
still here?

23:35.181 --> 23:37.016
Agent Eppes' brother
left a while ago.

23:37.049 --> 23:38.951
All right.
How's it going?

23:38.985 --> 23:40.086
Pretty good.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.056
I don't see him in here.

23:44.090 --> 23:45.925
What are you
talking about?

23:46.993 --> 23:48.795
Hey. Hey!

23:48.828 --> 23:51.731
Help! Help him.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.500
Hey!

23:53.533 --> 23:54.967
Hey, out in the water!

23:55.001 --> 23:56.903
FBI!

23:56.936 --> 23:58.671
-What happened?
-I don't know.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.907
I just saw him.
He wasn't moving.

24:00.940 --> 24:01.974
Get him to shore.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.150
Easy.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.052
Ready?
One, two, three.

24:18.024 --> 24:19.992
Call 911.

24:20.026 --> 24:22.595
Ruiz's blood alcohol
level was .2.

24:22.629 --> 24:25.131
And a preliminary tox report
found diazepam.

24:25.164 --> 24:26.999
That's a muscle relaxant.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.001
I got your message.
Is he all right?

24:29.035 --> 24:30.603
Yeah, he's all right.
He's recovering.

24:30.637 --> 24:32.071
-What happened?
-We don't know yet.

24:32.104 --> 24:34.006
David found him
unconscious in the canal.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.174
Did you talk to the guy
that rescued him?

24:35.207 --> 24:37.043
What do you mean
"the guy who rescued him?"

24:37.076 --> 24:38.678
When I got there there was a guy

24:38.711 --> 24:39.646
pulling him
out of the water.

24:39.679 --> 24:42.014
Basic protocol of
a secret assassination:

24:42.048 --> 24:42.949
Be the first respondent.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.988
I think you were face to face
with Condor.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.568
I don't remember any man.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.002
I certainly can't describe him.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.871
What's the last thing
you do remember?

25:04.904 --> 25:06.172
Your brother and I spoke.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.608
Then I went and fixed
something to eat.

25:08.641 --> 25:09.842
What'd you eat?

25:09.876 --> 25:11.978
Just something from my cafe.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.045
You also had something to drink.

25:13.079 --> 25:14.814
Some wine.

25:14.847 --> 25:15.982
The wine from the same cafe?

25:16.015 --> 25:17.850
Yes.

25:17.884 --> 25:18.785
You went for a walk alone.

25:18.818 --> 25:20.687
You avoided the agent
sent to guard you

25:20.720 --> 25:22.722
when you knew your life
was at risk.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.191
It was foolish.

25:25.224 --> 25:26.559
I know that now.

25:26.593 --> 25:28.227
I mean you go walking
around these canals

25:28.260 --> 25:29.962
with alcohol and enough diazepam
in your system

25:29.996 --> 25:31.898
to knock you out.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.901
You think I did this to myself?

25:34.934 --> 25:36.803
Well, my brother said
you were pretty upset.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.338
I went to clear my head.

25:39.371 --> 25:40.573
That's all.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.614
All right, this is a list
of names of people

25:47.647 --> 25:49.015
who work
at the Colombian consulate.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.216
Take a look at it.

25:50.249 --> 25:52.318
Put a mark next to any names
that are linked

25:52.351 --> 25:54.220
to your family's enemies
in Bogota.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.631
BENAVIDES: So you believe
the Condor is real,

26:04.664 --> 26:06.633
and that they have
one of their assassins

26:06.666 --> 26:08.635
here in Los Angeles.

26:08.668 --> 26:09.435
I also have evidence

26:09.468 --> 26:11.170
linking that plot
to your office.

26:11.203 --> 26:13.640
What do you want?

26:13.673 --> 26:16.242
I want the name of the person
running the operation.

26:18.645 --> 26:21.347
Look, Henry Korfelt's
credit card records

26:21.380 --> 26:24.050
show him buying coffee
for himself and someone else.

26:24.083 --> 26:25.652
Five times.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.919
You believe it was me?

26:26.953 --> 26:29.288
Think I'd be here if I did?

26:29.321 --> 26:32.659
Look, I don't know anything
about a murder plot.

26:32.692 --> 26:33.926
Hold on.
This is a list

26:33.960 --> 26:35.261
of people who work
at the consulate.

26:35.294 --> 26:36.629
Now someone on this list does.

26:41.167 --> 26:44.837
Even if what you
are telling me is true,

26:44.871 --> 26:48.407
by helping you, you're asking me
to betray a fellow countryman.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.944
No, what I asking you to do
is save one.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.785
( drums play intro )

26:58.818 --> 27:03.723
( rock music plays )

27:03.756 --> 27:07.293
*

27:07.326 --> 27:09.261
( knocking on door )

27:09.295 --> 27:10.362
Charlie!

27:10.396 --> 27:11.898
Hey.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.666
Gabriel's new schedule.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.710
He's following a far more
restricted routine.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.377
Yeah, well,
the thing is I don't know

27:25.411 --> 27:27.246
if it's enough
to stop Condor.

27:27.279 --> 27:28.881
If I'm right,
it may alter his methods.

27:28.915 --> 27:30.282
You see, he may be considering

27:30.316 --> 27:31.984
a low-probability attack
because he thinks

27:32.018 --> 27:33.285
that's what we won't
be looking for.

27:33.319 --> 27:34.721
'Cause if he's trying
to outthink us

27:34.754 --> 27:36.388
we're going to be trying
to outthink him.

27:36.422 --> 27:38.457
It's "Cognitive Hierarchy."

27:38.490 --> 27:40.259
A zero-step thinker will
play the obvious moves.

27:40.292 --> 27:41.894
A one-step thinker will play
the non-obvious moves.

27:41.928 --> 27:45.431
While the two-step thinker,
he'll consider both types.

27:45.464 --> 27:47.099
Have you talked to your contact
at the consulate?

27:47.133 --> 27:48.935
Yeah, I'm hoping
she'll spread the word.

27:48.968 --> 27:50.069
But I don't know.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.104
This type of conspiracy
relies on people

27:52.138 --> 27:53.272
feeling like
they can't be touched.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.140
Like no one knows
what they're doing.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.308
Once they hear the FBI's
on this case,

27:56.342 --> 27:58.310
It's likely to force
a change in strategy

27:58.344 --> 28:00.279
which I can account for.

28:00.312 --> 28:01.781
So does that make me
a three-step thinker?

28:01.814 --> 28:04.183
Keep working with me.
You'll get there.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.384
-Shut up.
-Soon enough.

28:05.417 --> 28:07.019
Soon enough.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.320
You work it out with Dad

28:08.354 --> 28:10.389
about Aunt Irene's party
and your concert?

28:10.422 --> 28:12.091
Oh, you know what?

28:12.124 --> 28:15.194
I, um, I couldn't even
get the tickets.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.395
So you don't have a date
with Amita?

28:16.428 --> 28:17.897
No, uh, no big deal.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.331
What is going on
with you guys?

28:19.365 --> 28:21.200
You've been playing this game
for like a year.

28:21.233 --> 28:23.402
It's okay.

28:23.435 --> 28:26.038
Charlie, when are you gonna
start living your own life

28:26.072 --> 28:28.274
and realize that Dad
can take care of himself?

28:28.307 --> 28:29.776
Look, I'll tell you what.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.277
You help me catch this guy

28:31.310 --> 28:33.412
and I'll go to Aunt Irene's
next party, all right?

28:33.445 --> 28:35.347
Deal.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.353
-Hey.
-Where you been?

28:41.387 --> 28:42.488
Local DEA.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.423
Running down the names
from the Colombian consulate.

28:44.456 --> 28:47.426
I got nothing; how'd you guys do
with Korfelt's known associates?

28:47.459 --> 28:49.361
Charlie decoded a name
from Korfelt's book.

28:49.395 --> 28:50.763
W. Wells.

28:50.797 --> 28:51.864
Okay.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.032
We ran down 47 people

28:53.065 --> 28:55.034
first initial "W"
last name Wells.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.435
Found three of them
with sheets.

28:56.468 --> 28:58.938
One Warren Davis Wells
has a record for sale

28:58.971 --> 29:00.807
and possession
of illegal weapons.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.374
But aside from his name
in the book,

29:02.408 --> 29:04.010
has no other ties
to Korfelt.

29:04.043 --> 29:06.445
Well, Condor shot Korfelt
with a high-powered rifle.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.347
He probably
got that locally.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.449
Maybe Korfelt's
his L.A. contact.

29:10.482 --> 29:12.051
We don't have
an address on him.

29:12.084 --> 29:13.452
But according to this,
he has a brother

29:13.485 --> 29:15.321
who owns a computer shop
in West L.A.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.189
Drive safely.

29:17.223 --> 29:18.257
Hey, Amita.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.959
Hey, Charlie.

29:19.992 --> 29:23.095
How's the hunt
for Red October going?

29:23.129 --> 29:24.263
You know, the assassin?

29:24.296 --> 29:25.197
Oh, yeah,
I'm working on it.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.866
Listen, there's something
I really need

29:26.899 --> 29:28.400
to talk to you
about, though.

29:28.434 --> 29:29.501
Um, the concert.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.403
I don't think I can go.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.505
Oh. Too busy with the case?

29:33.539 --> 29:35.074
Actually, no.
It's a family event.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.176
And my dad doesn't
want to go alone.

29:37.209 --> 29:39.245
I see.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.147
You can have the tickets.
That's not a problem.

29:41.180 --> 29:43.249
No, I can't.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.383
I already bought them.

29:44.416 --> 29:45.384
I bought them for you.

29:45.417 --> 29:46.252
And it would be a shame

29:46.285 --> 29:49.255
if you didn't go
and have a good time.

29:49.288 --> 29:51.057
Actually, Charlie,
I have other plans.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.392
I'm going to San Diego.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.262
Dr. Keppler's giving
a seminar at UCSD.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.897
After what happened
at dinner...

29:57.930 --> 29:59.398
I'm sorry. I just...

29:59.431 --> 30:01.400
I didn't think you were
actually gonna get them.

30:01.433 --> 30:02.401
Right. No.

30:02.434 --> 30:03.870
I mean,

30:03.903 --> 30:06.072
we've talked about this
so many times.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.506
I totally understand.
It's not a big deal.

30:07.539 --> 30:09.608
I'm sure I can find somebody
who wants the tickets.

30:09.641 --> 30:10.910
It's the White Stripes, so...

30:13.112 --> 30:15.114
I'll see you later.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.016
Okay.

30:24.891 --> 30:27.093
( beeping )

30:29.461 --> 30:31.097
Is Warren Wells here?

30:31.130 --> 30:32.464
I don't know.

30:32.498 --> 30:33.866
I'll go check.

30:33.900 --> 30:35.634
Hold on.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.636
We'll see for ourselves.
Sit down.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.171
Get back.

30:39.205 --> 30:40.439
Do not move.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.440
Put it down.

30:41.473 --> 30:42.608
Drop it.

30:42.641 --> 30:44.443
Put it down.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.278
Come on.

30:46.312 --> 30:49.248
( gun cocks )

30:49.281 --> 30:51.083
Put it down. Slowly.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.385
Put it down!

30:53.419 --> 30:54.453
Right now.

31:06.398 --> 31:08.434
You know if you fired,
you'd have blinded me, right?

31:08.467 --> 31:09.635
Should've closed your eyes.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.005
Oh.

31:14.506 --> 31:17.343
Looks like we got
a very different type of Mac.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.985
Warren Wells did a stint in
the Army, and then went to work

31:26.018 --> 31:27.019
for a gun manufacturer.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.287
Then he got
into arms dealing.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.989
But single point
transactions.

31:30.022 --> 31:31.657
Hard to acquire
or custom-made.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.425
Very hard
to acquire.

31:33.459 --> 31:34.693
I found this at Well's shop.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.162
It's a FRAG-12 cartridge,

31:36.195 --> 31:38.430
high explosive
fragmentation round.

31:38.464 --> 31:39.465
( whistles )

31:39.498 --> 31:40.666
What shoots this?

31:40.699 --> 31:45.604
This Auto Assault 12
combat shotgun.

31:45.637 --> 31:47.506
Uses a gas piston.
No recoil.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.176
Fast and easy.

31:50.209 --> 31:51.610
When you just really
got to kill someone.

31:51.643 --> 31:53.412
If Condor's got

31:53.445 --> 31:55.181
a gun like this...

31:55.214 --> 31:57.383
The when Gabriel Ruiz
tries to run,

31:57.416 --> 31:59.518
he's just going to be really
tired when he gets killed.

32:03.489 --> 32:04.690
CHARLIE: Condor's decision
to employ this weapon

32:04.723 --> 32:06.458
changes everything.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.961
I mean it's pretty hard to keep
the murder a secret, right?

32:08.995 --> 32:11.097
Sure. And an open
assassination means

32:11.130 --> 32:13.699
Condor's opportunities increase,
like five-fold, ten-fold.

32:13.732 --> 32:15.334
Warren Wells' computer
repair shop

32:15.367 --> 32:16.635
got a new client
two weeks ago.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.404
The Colombian consulate.

32:18.437 --> 32:19.471
Yeah, check it out.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.739
Repaired six
of their computers.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.541
What's that mean?

32:22.574 --> 32:24.510
Hard evidence of a link
between the consulate

32:24.543 --> 32:25.511
and Condor's weapons dealer.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.213
And it gives
credence to it being

32:27.246 --> 32:28.580
-run by someone inside the
consulate. -Mm-hmm.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.516
If that's true, it's a
connection we could exploit.

32:30.549 --> 32:31.383
How?

32:31.417 --> 32:33.719
By removing step-thinking
entirely.

32:33.752 --> 32:37.056
It's like the game of chess...

32:37.089 --> 32:38.991
where you must think first
before you move.

32:39.025 --> 32:41.060
Each player trying
to outthink each other,

32:41.093 --> 32:42.528
trying to guess
each other's moves,

32:42.561 --> 32:44.530
each other's strategy.

32:44.563 --> 32:49.501
The complexity of the game
requires multi-step thinking.

32:49.535 --> 32:53.139
However, if one player can
create the illusion

32:53.172 --> 32:55.474
he has committed
a zero-step move--

32:55.507 --> 32:57.109
a move that would give
his opponent

32:57.143 --> 32:58.510
a significant advantage--

32:58.544 --> 33:02.048
that can create a false step
of thinking in his opponent,

33:02.081 --> 33:05.417
which will then prompt a move
that delivers checkmate.

33:08.220 --> 33:09.555
You eliminate the need
for a strategy

33:09.588 --> 33:11.457
by creating a move outside

33:11.490 --> 33:13.225
the conditions
of the game.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.294
In other words, you
set up an ambush.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.464
Right. Because if he's being run
by someone inside the consulate,

33:18.497 --> 33:19.531
we use Benavides,

33:19.565 --> 33:21.200
to make Condor think he's got

33:21.233 --> 33:22.434
some kind of privileged
information.

33:22.468 --> 33:24.736
And theoretically, he steps up
his game, right?

33:24.770 --> 33:27.139
Right.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.475
Gabriel's going back
to Colombia.

33:29.508 --> 33:30.542
Going back
to Colombia? How?

33:30.576 --> 33:33.779
My country's got a standing
exile order against him.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.481
It's going to be lifted
in 48 hours.

33:35.514 --> 33:36.748
I know nothing about this.

33:36.782 --> 33:38.484
Where did you get your
information?

33:38.517 --> 33:42.321
Seems your country's been after
a pretty sizeable DEA grant.

33:42.354 --> 33:43.822
The U.S. decided to step up.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.457
To get rid of its problem.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.592
As soon as it's lifted,

33:46.625 --> 33:49.261
he's going to be on a military
jet bound for Bogota.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.463
Until then, he'll be
under FBI protection.

33:51.497 --> 33:53.065
I just thought you'd
want to know.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.666
What do you expect me

33:54.700 --> 33:56.302
to do with this?

33:56.335 --> 33:57.369
I don't know, Sonya.

33:57.403 --> 33:59.205
I wouldn't sit on it
if I were you.

33:59.238 --> 34:01.073
I can't imagine your supervisors
are going to be too happy

34:01.107 --> 34:02.141
with you withholding
information about

34:02.174 --> 34:04.310
the well-being of one of
their citizens, you know?

34:08.647 --> 34:11.450
DAVID: So, the trap at
the safe house is set.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.619
If Benavides or anyone at the
Consulate is Condor's contact...

34:13.652 --> 34:15.321
-Then Condor's up to speed.
-Yeah.

34:15.354 --> 34:16.222
He's got to move fast.

34:16.255 --> 34:17.623
The window of opportunity
is closing.

34:17.656 --> 34:19.258
That's right.
And we've narrowed it down

34:19.291 --> 34:20.626
to a couple hours. One location.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.594
And agents placed
strategically

34:22.628 --> 34:24.330
to give the illusion
of an exposed entry.

34:24.363 --> 34:25.431
The game has changed completely.

34:25.464 --> 34:28.167
Yeah. Well, at least it's a game
we know how to play.

34:32.738 --> 34:34.640
GABRIEL: So, we're just supposed
to sit here

34:34.673 --> 34:35.774
and wait for him?

34:35.807 --> 34:38.244
Yep, that's pretty
much the plan.

34:40.679 --> 34:43.749
And what makes you so sure
he'll really show up.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.417
Actually, you.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.587
Don't worry about it.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.455
Everything's going to be fine.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.523
That's why they call it
a "safe house."

35:33.665 --> 35:35.701
FBI. Drop it.

35:35.734 --> 35:37.203
FBI. Don't move.
Drop the gun.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.479
Get your hands out
where I can see them.

35:47.513 --> 35:48.480
Get your hands out.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.648
Get them out.

35:49.681 --> 35:50.616
Don't!

35:57.289 --> 35:59.258
Who do you work for?
Tell me who you work for.

36:25.484 --> 36:27.453
Sonya.

36:27.486 --> 36:29.688
Agent Eppes, so I heard--

36:29.721 --> 36:33.325
that the man you were
pursuing is dead.

36:33.359 --> 36:35.361
Who was he?

36:37.563 --> 36:38.864
Truthfully?

36:38.897 --> 36:40.999
Yeah, truthfully.

36:41.032 --> 36:41.867
I have no idea.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.237
But I am very glad
that you succeeded

36:45.271 --> 36:46.805
in saving Gabriel Ruiz's life.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.308
Come on.

36:49.341 --> 36:51.610
You and I both know if whoever
put out that contract

36:51.643 --> 36:53.512
isn't caught, that kid doesn't
stand a chance.

36:53.545 --> 36:56.248
Failed assassinations
rarely bode well

36:56.282 --> 36:58.517
for the long-term health
of those who plot them.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.787
We're willing to share with
your government what we know.

37:01.820 --> 37:04.556
Yeah.

37:04.590 --> 37:09.328
When your government shares
what they know with you.

37:09.361 --> 37:10.829
What does that mean?

37:10.862 --> 37:15.367
Well the truth is that the best
assassins in Colombia

37:15.401 --> 37:16.568
are trained by your CIA.

37:16.602 --> 37:19.671
I want you
to remember that

37:19.705 --> 37:22.007
the next time you talk
about Colombian problems

37:22.040 --> 37:23.008
being played out

37:23.041 --> 37:25.844
in the streets
of Los Angeles.

37:29.481 --> 37:31.917
So who was the Condor?

37:31.950 --> 37:33.752
Prints didn't show up
in any database.

37:33.785 --> 37:34.920
Not ours. Not Interpol's.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.021
Oh, come on.

37:36.054 --> 37:37.623
Somebody's got to know
who he is.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.291
He's not a ghost.

37:39.325 --> 37:40.792
Just 'cause he's dead doesn't
mean there aren't

37:40.826 --> 37:42.928
a whole lot more just like
him out there somewhere.

37:42.961 --> 37:45.631
Yeah, Gabriel
may be right.

37:45.664 --> 37:48.400
There may be no way for him
to really save himself.

37:48.434 --> 37:49.635
I appreciate you coming
to see me.

37:49.668 --> 37:51.537
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.539
Well, thanks to you
and your brother,

37:53.572 --> 37:54.940
I seem to be doing fine.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.075
It also gives me a chance
to thank you,

37:57.108 --> 37:57.776
and to say good-bye.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.611
I'm going back
to Colombia.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.080
Are you serious?

38:02.113 --> 38:04.450
My exile's been lifted.

38:04.483 --> 38:07.052
Gabriel, killing the assassin
doesn't make you safe there.

38:07.085 --> 38:08.454
I wasn't safe here.

38:08.487 --> 38:09.588
Still, your probabilities
for survival

38:09.621 --> 38:11.823
are way better
if you stay in America.

38:11.857 --> 38:14.826
Truth is, I'm not
so afraid anymore.

38:14.860 --> 38:17.896
Don't get me wrong.
I'm not any braver than I was.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.698
It's just...

38:19.731 --> 38:21.833
Somehow this Condor
finding me

38:21.867 --> 38:24.803
has given me a chance
to find myself, I guess.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.473
Turns out, I'm a Ruiz after all.

38:29.408 --> 38:30.809
What'll you do when
you get there?

38:32.744 --> 38:34.780
I know I can't be my father
and brother.

38:36.948 --> 38:39.485
All I can do is take
my camera down there

38:39.518 --> 38:42.020
and try and tell their story.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.556
And in telling theirs,
maybe I'll learn my own.

38:52.431 --> 38:54.933
What are you doing here?

38:54.966 --> 38:58.404
Hey, I'm ready to party
like it's 1899.

38:58.437 --> 38:59.538
Lose the suit. Go find Amita.

38:59.571 --> 39:01.440
Amita's in San Diego.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.674
What?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.510
Yeah, it's a long story.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.644
Bummer.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.513
Well we all got 'em, pal.

39:07.546 --> 39:09.515
-Who got the tickets?
-Larry.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.716
Larry's into
the White Stripes?

39:10.749 --> 39:12.951
Oh, now isn't this nice?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.787
We're all going to Aunt Irene's
together, huh?

39:15.821 --> 39:16.688
Yeah. You ready?

39:16.722 --> 39:18.524
I hope you brought
your dancing shoes.

39:18.557 --> 39:19.525
She hired a band.

39:19.558 --> 39:20.626
Uh-oh.

39:20.659 --> 39:22.528
Yeah, from the Big Band
era, I hear.

39:22.561 --> 39:24.530
Yeah, well a little
Glenn Miller, a lot of drinks.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.631
What could be better?

39:25.664 --> 39:28.166
Yeah, just a word
of advice.

39:28.199 --> 39:29.167
Yeah?

39:29.200 --> 39:32.137
Make yourself scarce when
the slow music starts.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.039
Oh, Dad, you're
the designated dancer.

39:34.072 --> 39:35.841
No, she
hates me.
