00:06.354 --> 00:07.355
If we're gonna be partners,
I need to know.

00:07.398 --> 00:08.747
- I was a surgical resident.

00:08.791 --> 00:10.053
I cheated on my boards

00:10.097 --> 00:11.750
and got kicked out.

00:11.794 --> 00:12.795
- Good to see you, man.

00:12.838 --> 00:13.796
- Good to see you, Ritter.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.058
- Hey, maybe you noticed

00:15.102 --> 00:16.494
I'm not with Engine 37 anymore.

00:16.538 --> 00:19.410
- You'll get a permanent
assignment soon enough.

00:19.454 --> 00:21.412
- I have a suggestion
for your Engine Lieutenant.

00:21.456 --> 00:24.198
- I won't let Jerry Gorsch
call the shots.

00:24.241 --> 00:27.157
- You need to make
the best choice for the house.

00:27.201 --> 00:29.464
- I am proud to announce

00:29.507 --> 00:31.292
Christopher Herrmann
will be taking over

00:31.335 --> 00:33.207
as the next Lieutenant
on Engine 51.

00:42.129 --> 00:44.131
- Those bugles
look good on you...

00:44.174 --> 00:47.090
Lieutenant.

00:49.179 --> 00:51.442
- They feel good.

00:58.145 --> 00:59.320
- Hey.

00:59.363 --> 01:00.625
What do you got
going on today?

01:00.669 --> 01:04.325
You plan on just
hanging out around here?

01:04.368 --> 01:05.717
- Unless we get a call.

01:05.761 --> 01:08.155
- Well, yeah,
but no plans to...

01:08.198 --> 01:10.200
go to headquarters,
the supply people,

01:10.244 --> 01:12.202
giving expert testimony,

01:12.246 --> 01:14.552
you know, nothing like that?

01:16.250 --> 01:18.556
- One of my best friends
from high school is in town.

01:18.600 --> 01:19.731
- Yes.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.777
And I really want you
to meet him.

01:21.820 --> 01:24.693
I mean, he's basically like
my twin brother.

01:24.736 --> 01:28.088
He's--he's the best.
You're gonna love him.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.480
- Let me know when
he gets here.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.092
- I will.

01:34.659 --> 01:37.532
- Empty every length of 2 1/2
out of the hose bed

01:37.575 --> 01:39.577
and flake it off
down the apron.

01:39.621 --> 01:40.578
- Hey, Herrmann.

01:40.622 --> 01:41.840
Maybe you forgot,

01:41.884 --> 01:43.755
but we dropped the lines
last shift.

01:43.799 --> 01:46.715
- And then they were used
on two calls.

01:46.758 --> 01:49.326
Drop 'em again.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.418
- You're a real ball-buster,
Lieutenant.

01:54.462 --> 01:55.898
- It's standard procedure

01:55.941 --> 01:58.292
to inspect the hose beds
every shift.

01:58.335 --> 01:59.467
They know that.

01:59.510 --> 02:01.208
He's just testing the new guy

02:01.251 --> 02:02.861
to see what he can
get away with.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.733
- Maybe they don't like
taking orders

02:04.776 --> 02:06.648
from someone coming off truck.

02:06.691 --> 02:09.172
- Nobody likes
taking orders, period.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.782
My youngest decided that

02:10.826 --> 02:12.349
he wanted to go to school today

02:12.393 --> 02:13.611
dressed as Spider-Man.

02:13.655 --> 02:14.743
I told him to change

02:14.786 --> 02:16.614
and he threw a tantrum.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.749
- And I didn't have time
to argue,

02:20.792 --> 02:22.446
so he went to school
dressed as Spider-Man.

anything, right?

the severity of the break,

20:33.884 --> 20:36.278
- How do a couple teenagers
in Chicago

20:36.322 --> 20:38.628
get ahold of one of those?

20:43.764 --> 20:45.374
- Nothing.

20:45.418 --> 20:47.115
Just taking a bathroom break.

20:47.158 --> 20:50.161
- Oh.

20:50.205 --> 20:51.815
You guys finish scrubbing down

20:51.859 --> 20:53.469
those nozzles already?

20:53.513 --> 20:56.559
- Yes, sir.
They're good to go.

21:13.359 --> 21:15.404
- What are you looking
at me for?

21:15.448 --> 21:19.103
Anyone could have stolen those
out your locker.

21:19.147 --> 21:20.714
- Okay, I get it.

21:20.757 --> 21:23.194
Hazing the new guy, huh?
All right.

21:23.238 --> 21:26.328
Gluing my bugles in the urinal?

21:28.678 --> 21:30.593
- Oh.

21:30.637 --> 21:32.421
I guess this means
that it's my turn

21:32.465 --> 21:35.468
to prank you then, huh?

21:35.511 --> 21:37.252
Go grab your toothbrushes.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.819
Meet me out on the floor.

21:38.862 --> 21:41.343
I think those nozzles need
a second scrub-down.

you got to meet Tyler.

22:08.544 --> 22:10.372
I wish he could have
hung out longer, though.

You two barely got to talk.

and some of our old friends

22:17.858 --> 22:19.729

for the weekend.

22:19.773 --> 22:22.428
We used to go up there
in high school, rage,

22:22.471 --> 22:25.474
no parental supervision.
It was just crazy fun.

22:25.518 --> 22:27.346
Good memories.
- Huh.

22:29.870 --> 22:30.827
Do you not want me to go?

22:30.871 --> 22:32.351
What is this?

22:32.394 --> 22:33.700
What is this with you
and Tyler?

You didn't even try
to get to know him.

22:35.484 --> 22:39.270

22:39.314 --> 22:41.403
- We're friends.

- I mean...

22:43.623 --> 22:45.581
you maybe.

22:45.625 --> 22:48.279
But he's got his eye on more.

22:49.846 --> 22:51.413
- If you want to go, go.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.242
But I'm right about this.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.739

start restocking the ambo--

in one minute.

You don't think I know
what I'm talking about,

23:28.624 --> 23:31.018

because I told you

23:31.061 --> 23:32.889
I cheated on the boards.

23:32.933 --> 23:36.240
But that had nothing to do
with my instincts.

23:36.284 --> 23:38.373
I was a damn good doctor.

23:38.417 --> 23:40.462
- I don't doubt it.

23:40.506 --> 23:42.899
But that's not this job.

23:53.083 --> 23:57.566
Yep, anything you need.

you got a sec?

23:59.612 --> 24:02.005
- Always.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.573

- What's on your mind,
Lieutenant?

It's, a...

little...

24:10.797 --> 24:13.364
personnel issue.

I'm not here to rat
anybody out or anything.

24:22.548 --> 24:26.508
I'm just hoping for
some advice.

24:29.772 --> 24:31.774
the right decision
promoting me, so

24:31.818 --> 24:34.690
I got some books on leadership.

24:34.734 --> 24:36.518
And they all say,

24:36.562 --> 24:40.827
"Emotional stability
is an important trait

24:40.870 --> 24:43.917
for an effective leader."

24:43.960 --> 24:45.440
But, uh,

24:45.484 --> 24:49.052
to be honest, Chief, um...

24:49.096 --> 24:52.012
I'm about to lose it
on this guy.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.840
- Hmm.

24:53.883 --> 24:56.799
Okay, here's my advice.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.888
Forget what the damn books say.

24:58.932 --> 25:02.413
Go with your gut.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.372
I promoted you

to make the right call.

25:06.809 --> 25:12.075
So go do what you gotta do.

25:13.729 --> 25:16.079
Can I help you, ma'am?

25:16.123 --> 25:18.038
- I didn't know
where else to go.

25:18.081 --> 25:20.736
Maybe you'll know what
to do with these?

25:29.919 --> 25:30.093
.

25:30.137 --> 25:31.094
- Here.

25:31.138 --> 25:32.705
Whoa, careful.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.228
Don't want to drop these.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.186
- They're heavier
than they look.

25:37.231 --> 25:39.320
- They were my late husband's.

25:39.363 --> 25:42.018
I saw on the news
that a grenade exploded.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.454

turn them in.

25:50.461 --> 25:53.203

25:53.247 --> 25:55.510
- Cruz, clear everyone
off the floor.

25:55.554 --> 25:56.990
- Yeah, no problem.

25:57.033 --> 25:59.427
- Here.

25:59.470 --> 26:00.733
I'll keep an eye on these

26:00.776 --> 26:02.038
till the Bomb Squad gets here.

26:02.082 --> 26:04.345
These...look old.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.520
Could be unstable.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.959
- Blast radius shrinks
to a few feet

26:10.003 --> 26:13.223
with a Kevlar vest around it.
I got this.

26:13.267 --> 26:16.531
- Ma'am, right this way.

26:22.755 --> 26:26.149
- Yeah, thanks.
See you soon.

26:26.193 --> 26:29.457
Ma'am.

26:29.500 --> 26:32.068
So, uh,

26:32.112 --> 26:35.115
police are on their way.

26:35.158 --> 26:37.378
They're gonna have
some questions for you.

26:37.421 --> 26:39.989
- I figured they might.

26:40.033 --> 26:42.426
- Where'd your husband
get the grenades?

26:42.470 --> 26:44.254
- I'm not sure.

26:44.298 --> 26:45.952
He fought in Vietnam.

26:45.995 --> 26:48.563
Collected all kinds
of memorabilia.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.087
After he passed,
I decided to move.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.394
I had a garage sale to

26:53.437 --> 26:57.354
get rid of all the clutter.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.922
I thought they were replicas.

26:59.966 --> 27:01.750
I never would have sold any

27:01.794 --> 27:06.537
if I thought they were real.

27:06.581 --> 27:08.365
- How many grenades
did you sell?

27:08.409 --> 27:10.106
- Looked like three
were missing.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.281
- That's right.

27:11.325 --> 27:13.849
There was a bald man,

27:13.893 --> 27:16.199
a young man who lived down
the street,

27:16.243 --> 27:19.115
and a boy
I'd never seen before.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.079
Okay, everyone, settle down.

27:26.122 --> 27:27.776
Settle.

27:27.820 --> 27:29.212
I'm sure you've heard by now
there is another grenade

27:29.256 --> 27:30.518
in the neighborhood.

27:30.561 --> 27:31.606
CPD is on the case,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.434
but now 51 is going to help.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.479
- We're putting up fliers,
making phone calls,

27:35.523 --> 27:37.351
and posting on social media
to warn people

27:37.394 --> 27:39.005
the grenade is real.

27:39.048 --> 27:41.137
But also to find the boy
who has it.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.270
- Couldn't all this talk
of a grenade cause a panic?

27:43.313 --> 27:45.315
- A little panic is in order.

27:45.359 --> 27:48.101
- The boy is around
11 or 12 years old.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.624
He arrived on foot alone,

27:49.668 --> 27:52.409
which means he most likely
lives in the area.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.585
- Each unit will have
a street to canvass

27:54.629 --> 27:56.500
along with some schools
and playgrounds.

27:56.544 --> 27:58.067
Okay?

27:58.111 --> 27:59.242
Let's get a move on.

27:59.286 --> 28:01.375
Time is of the essence.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.031
- Hey.

28:05.074 --> 28:07.033
I, uh, I thought about it a lot

28:07.076 --> 28:10.340
and I'm not going to the lake
this weekend.

28:10.384 --> 28:12.299
- No.

28:12.342 --> 28:14.344
- You know, I got to catch up
with Tyler today,

28:14.388 --> 28:16.346
and, uh, you know, you and I
have been talking about

28:16.390 --> 28:17.870
going to Buddy Guy's.

28:17.913 --> 28:20.437
- Yeah.

28:20.481 --> 28:21.874
Absolutely.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.092
- That's 500, let's go.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.486
- All right.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.490
- All right, hey, 51!

28:29.533 --> 28:31.187
Let's go find this kid.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.146
- And keep it serious, guys.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.888
We got a Lieutenant
with no sense of humor.

28:43.460 --> 28:46.637
If being a firefighter
is such a big joke to you,

28:46.681 --> 28:48.552
don't worry about coming out
with us.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.380
- Oh, hey, relax.

28:50.424 --> 28:52.034

28:52.078 --> 28:53.209
You know what?

28:53.253 --> 28:55.298
I already filled it out.

28:55.342 --> 28:57.431
You know what they say, Barnes?

28:57.474 --> 29:00.042
One bad apple
can spoil the bunch.

29:00.086 --> 29:02.262
I need you guys
to work together

29:02.305 --> 29:03.872

29:13.577 --> 29:15.884
And follow standard procedure,
right?

29:15.928 --> 29:18.582
And that is why I am
transferring you

29:18.626 --> 29:21.194
out of 51.

29:21.237 --> 29:22.543
Go clean out your locker

29:22.586 --> 29:25.067

I get back.

29:25.111 --> 29:26.677
