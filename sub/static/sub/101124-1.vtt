00:13.080 --> 00:17.080
<font color=#FFFF53>KAT AND THE BAND

00:34.880 --> 00:36.880
What time are they on?

00:37.440 --> 00:38.810
Nine.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.040
Like seriously, so you have
the money to get in?

00:41.200 --> 00:43.200
No.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.200
- What's your number?
- Sorry?

01:22.320 --> 01:24.480
- What's your number?
- Oh, it's...

01:27.160 --> 01:29.160
He's really good.

01:31.040 --> 01:34.080
I've listened to them on YouTube,
they're going to be great.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.360
- Ready?
- As always.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.040
Kat Malone, Jane Barrowman,
Power Cords Music Management.

01:56.120 --> 01:58.120
We're on the list.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.600
Not on the list.

02:02.560 --> 02:04.130
You're incompetent.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.690
You call yourself a PA

02:05.840 --> 02:08.639
and you can't even remember to phone
and get my name on the list?

02:08.720 --> 02:09.720
What?

02:09.800 --> 02:13.840
You heard me, you skinny legged,
goggled eyed, burger brain reject.

02:14.240 --> 02:16.240
- You're fired.
- Harsh.

02:16.400 --> 02:18.960
Don't even bother coming
into work tomorrow.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.600
- What's your boss's name?
- Kat Malone.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.480
Ah, Miss Malone?

02:26.440 --> 02:29.520
Found your name,
Kat Malone plus one.

02:30.200 --> 02:32.200
My mistake.

02:32.960 --> 02:35.320
- You need to find a new job.
- I know.

02:37.080 --> 02:40.960
I get it, my eyes are big,
but Google eyed, is that a thing?

02:41.120 --> 02:43.360
Do your eyes really grow bigger
if you Google too much?

02:43.480 --> 02:46.520
Goggle, goggle eyed.

02:46.640 --> 02:49.240
Oh, yeah. Sick dig.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.520
If I ever dance like that,
just put me down.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.920
Promise?

03:24.240 --> 03:27.360
What shall we get to drink,
vodka cranberry or...

03:27.560 --> 03:30.200
- I know, let's get turbo bombs.
- Oh Jane!

03:39.880 --> 03:42.360
Marcus!
We love you Marcus!

03:45.160 --> 03:47.160
They're on.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.280
The Risk Factor? You like?

03:53.800 --> 03:55.960
Ah, yeah, yeah, what's not to like?

03:56.760 --> 03:58.520
That is if you like
a band that tick every box

03:58.600 --> 04:01.280
in the desperate need to appeal
to all demographics.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.360
- So not so much?
- No.

04:06.320 --> 04:08.320
Go on.

04:32.000 --> 04:36.320
Hi, one turbo bomb
and one vodka lemonade.

04:36.800 --> 04:38.800
That's thirteen pounds fifty.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.040
Yeah, I'm a guest of Dollar Days,

04:43.200 --> 04:46.480
so if you could just put it
on their tab and make it a double?

04:46.640 --> 04:47.640
Alright.

04:47.720 --> 04:49.920
I was invited over
by the band's management,

04:50.000 --> 04:53.280
which, between you and me,
are incompetent.

04:53.360 --> 04:56.840
I mean why play this gig
if you're not headlining?

04:57.280 --> 05:00.880
Zero point. I have no idea
what their manager was thinking.

05:01.320 --> 05:03.320
Let me help you.

05:04.840 --> 05:06.250
Thank you.

05:06.400 --> 05:09.960
I'm Kat Malone, music scout.
Why did... I mean I loved your set,

05:10.080 --> 05:12.440
why don't you and I grab
a seat and talk management?

05:12.520 --> 05:14.760
- We've got a manager.
- Who, who is your manager?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.890
Me.

05:17.040 --> 05:21.840
Right, I am, I'm so sorry about
the drinks, my bad, I'll pay you back.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.440
- What's your number?
- No need.

05:23.560 --> 05:26.480
There is, I loved your songs
and I, I really think...

05:26.560 --> 05:30.000
No, no, no, just don't go stealing
drinks off musicians, alright?

05:30.080 --> 05:33.880
There's enough people in this business
trying to rip you off. Tough.

05:34.440 --> 05:36.240
That's because you're playing
the wrong places.

05:36.320 --> 05:39.920
Your bass is too dominant,
your social media is social suicide

05:40.040 --> 05:42.040
and your set list confused.

05:42.960 --> 05:44.960
- Anything else?
- Yes!

05:45.160 --> 05:50.320
You have a sound that's so raw,
it's so heartfelt and...

05:50.400 --> 05:52.400
- You ready to go, mate?
- Yeah.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.640
- Who's she?
- No one, let's go.

05:54.880 --> 05:56.880
But wait, but no, I have more ideas.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.680
Um, wait, no, I, I really
think we should chat.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.040
Alex? Alex!

06:06.440 --> 06:10.080
Don't you just want to squeeze
them like a, like a cuddly koala?

06:10.240 --> 06:12.090
So much.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.880
Until I break his vocal chords

06:13.960 --> 06:16.600
so I never have to hear
his whining songs again.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.290
Peace.

06:18.440 --> 06:20.440
Out of the way.

06:22.200 --> 06:24.010
Alex! Hey, Alex!
I just want to...

06:24.160 --> 06:26.160
Oh shit.

06:29.920 --> 06:31.610
Hey.

06:31.760 --> 06:35.640
Typical, we're left with
the ab zombie.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.760
Musically dead,
but those are some abs.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.800
You are such a little horn-chick.

06:42.920 --> 06:44.920
Yeah. And?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.560
You'd think he'd have a party
to go to or something.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.920
Yeah.

06:51.960 --> 06:54.480
Yeah, you would.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.530
Shall we get the night bus?

06:58.680 --> 07:00.880
No! Don't say anything!
Kat!

07:01.800 --> 07:03.800
Hi.

07:04.240 --> 07:09.560
My friend over there, she thinks
you're fit, but she's super shy.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.880
Yeah, she's super cute.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.720
So basically,
she just needs a few drinks

07:15.800 --> 07:20.080
and then she relaxes
and will talk and stuff, to you.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.000
Okay.

07:22.080 --> 07:27.040
So... is there an after party we should
know about or something?

07:27.520 --> 07:30.480
You know, let me take
your number and I'll text you.

07:41.240 --> 07:42.810
What did you say?

07:42.960 --> 07:44.610
Nothing.

07:44.760 --> 07:49.880
He just randomly gave me the address
to a very cool after party.

07:50.160 --> 07:52.160
- No.
- And we're going.

07:52.360 --> 07:55.000
No! Seriously Kat?
Tomorrow is...

07:55.160 --> 07:59.280
Another boring day,
like every other boring day.

07:59.960 --> 08:05.240
Tonight, it begins, the future,
Dollar Days, they need our help.

08:06.160 --> 08:09.440
It's what we've always talked
about doing since forever.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.600
I'm sorry, I can't.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.610
He likes you.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.690
He'll be at the party.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.840
He's fit, you said he was.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.120
I suppose, for a short while.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.320
Just pretend you belong.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.679
- Use your gifts.
- What?

08:44.360 --> 08:46.360
Thank you.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.120
Excuse me.

08:52.840 --> 08:57.840
Mm, yeah, yeah, I know,
I know, right? Yeah, totally.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.480
I love Matthew McConaughey too.

09:00.560 --> 09:03.800
Hey, ah, I'm happy, you're happy,
that's what I'm good at.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.960
Speak later.

09:06.680 --> 09:09.160
- Hi.
- You get around.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.000
- I...
- Right, yeah, the free drinks, yeah.

09:14.840 --> 09:18.320
- Yeah, very funny, you're funny.
- Cool.

09:18.440 --> 09:21.360
Shame you don't show that side
of your personality on stage.

09:21.520 --> 09:22.810
What?

09:22.960 --> 09:26.520
Oh I'm, I'm just saying you could
show a bit more personality,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.600
a sense of humour when performing.

09:29.240 --> 09:32.720
- I totally have a sense of humour.
- I know, I just told you that.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.200
Ah, no I just told you that.

09:36.960 --> 09:42.280
- Ah look, what is it that you want?
- Well I don't, I don't want anything.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.280
Well then you're clearly
not a manager, are you?

09:45.560 --> 09:47.920
I mean you all want something,
whether it's an extra cut,

09:48.160 --> 09:51.120
push us in a direction
that we don't actually want to go in,

09:51.320 --> 09:53.000
dilute the music, steal the girlfriend.

09:53.080 --> 09:56.800
No! I do not want to steal
your girlfriend.

09:58.440 --> 10:00.440
That's good to know.

10:01.680 --> 10:02.890
I'm glad you don't want to sell out,

10:03.040 --> 10:06.120
because I'm only interested
in managing authentic artists.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.480
Kat Malone, ha-ha.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.760
Oi, good luck,
because she's the shit.

10:14.360 --> 10:16.360
Kat.

10:17.760 --> 10:19.760
You're in demand.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.200
I know a lot of people.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.480
He'll cool down by tomorrow.
We'll see if he makes it to rehearsal.

10:30.400 --> 10:32.400
I'll get a drink then.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.960
How about I come along?

10:36.640 --> 10:40.360
I'd love to hear more of your songs
and then we can take it from there.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.000
Ah, just give me your number
and I'll text you.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.440
Later.

10:52.880 --> 10:54.880
Jane, let's go.

10:55.400 --> 10:57.720
- Can you play me?
- It's not up to me, babe.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.400
I don't play the song.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.560
The song plays me.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.040
- Was this a dream?
- No!

11:14.280 --> 11:16.280
The dream is just beginning.

11:46.720 --> 11:48.720
Pulled an all-nighter.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.160
Got dressed in the dark, did you?

12:11.280 --> 12:13.090
I would, with a face like that.

12:13.240 --> 12:16.720
She's scared of catching
herself in the mirror, aren't you Kat?

12:19.880 --> 12:20.880
Frog face.

12:20.960 --> 12:23.520
A LEVEL SPANISH
MOCK EXAM, SILENCE PLEASE

12:26.120 --> 12:30.760
The subject for today's discussion,
my favourite holiday.

12:31.960 --> 12:35.640
My favourite holiday was in Slovenia.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.920
In the neighbouring village
there was a music festival.

12:41.120 --> 12:45.440
You can't solely blame
the mediocrity of contemporary music

12:46.160 --> 12:50.880
on the distribution network.
We have brains, don't we?

12:51.280 --> 12:54.760
We don't have our Bowies and Jonis

12:54.880 --> 13:00.360
because we choose to be spoon fed music
like factory fed chickens,

13:00.880 --> 13:06.760
made me to believe we enjoy
tasteless pellets of sound.

13:13.640 --> 13:15.680
- Yeah?
- Hi, Kat. It's Alex.

13:16.240 --> 13:19.320
- Alex from the band.
- Yes, yes, how are you?

13:19.400 --> 13:22.440
Yeah, good. Look I've been thinking
about what we talked about,

13:22.640 --> 13:23.960
you coming down to rehearsal.

13:24.080 --> 13:25.160
Kat Malone!

13:25.240 --> 13:28.680
Alex, I've got a situation here,
crazy client. Can we talk later?

13:28.760 --> 13:30.840
Yeah, sure, alright, I'll...

13:32.720 --> 13:34.490
- Mr. Kato.
- You know the rules.

13:34.640 --> 13:36.360
You can pick this up
at the end of the day.

13:36.440 --> 13:37.690
I do know the rules, sir,

13:37.840 --> 13:40.600
and you know,
in all the years I've stared at you,

13:40.720 --> 13:42.480
bored out of my brains
in music class,

13:42.560 --> 13:45.280
I have never seen you
in such a remarkably well fitted

13:45.400 --> 13:48.080
or well-coordinated outfit
as you're wearing today.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.800
It was supposed to be a secret!

13:52.560 --> 13:53.930
What was?

13:54.080 --> 13:59.000
The music concert that I'm organising.
Right now there's so much to be done.

13:59.120 --> 14:00.400
It's for exam results day.

14:00.520 --> 14:05.480
I thought it would be empowering
to celebrate such a momentous day

14:05.840 --> 14:07.760
with the ancient tradition of music,

14:07.840 --> 14:11.640
which historically has been used in
various rites of passage ceremonies.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.080
What do you want out
of this school, Kat?

14:15.360 --> 14:18.240
I mean, you're obviously bright,
you're talented,

14:18.400 --> 14:20.400
you can talk
the hind legs off a...

14:21.080 --> 14:23.240
Monkey?
I think it's a monkey.

14:23.720 --> 14:25.130
Or is it a donkey?

14:25.280 --> 14:28.360
But when it comes to focus,
you don't have it.

14:28.560 --> 14:31.160
- You're all over the place.
- I'm focused.

14:31.640 --> 14:34.400
I'm focused right now
on this concert, I am, I'm...

14:34.560 --> 14:38.240
Joy, Rose, you're performing
in my exam results concert, right?

14:42.240 --> 14:44.240
See?

14:45.560 --> 14:47.560
Not in the corridors, okay?

14:48.120 --> 14:49.290
Yes!

14:49.440 --> 14:51.840
And you still get a yellow warning.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.560
I'll be emailing your mother.

15:38.360 --> 15:40.760
How was the first exam? Snack
in fridge so don't go down to Gran.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.640
Left your revision schedule on your
desk upstairs. Look at it and revise!

16:01.640 --> 16:03.640
Gran, I'm home.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.960
I just don't get it,
why do I need to sit exams?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.120
I don't even want to go to uni.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.410
Organelles and cell theory,

16:16.560 --> 16:19.840
it's not exactly everyday conversation
in the music industry.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.240
- Have you got cystitis?
- No.

16:23.840 --> 16:25.810
Well it's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:25.960 --> 16:29.880
I know and if I had it
then I wouldn't be, but I don't.

16:30.080 --> 16:35.280
I had terrible cystitis in the sixties,
all those tight fitting hot pants.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.010
I just like the taste.

16:37.160 --> 16:39.200
Well there's no circulation down there.

16:39.280 --> 16:41.280
It's really fruity.

16:41.440 --> 16:45.920
I started to wear skirts
commando style, it sorted it.

16:47.520 --> 16:51.000
I bet Bowie never had
a yellow warning ruining his life.

16:53.800 --> 16:55.800
See this?

16:57.880 --> 17:00.720
This is your yellow warning.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.880
Gone, no longer exists.

17:14.000 --> 17:17.960
That's how Bowie
would have dealt with it.

17:18.520 --> 17:22.520
He chose his own reality,
his own fluid identity.

17:22.720 --> 17:26.040
You need to do the same.

17:26.319 --> 17:30.760
Don't let other people's sense
of reality dictate yours.

17:31.240 --> 17:36.840
In Kat's dictionary of life, it's only
you who can write it's definition.

17:41.800 --> 17:44.480
Gran, I swear I'm not going
to let anyone stop me.

17:44.560 --> 17:45.810
Kat!

17:45.960 --> 17:47.960
Get up here, now!

17:54.080 --> 17:56.000
No, I don't think
you do understand, Kat,

17:56.080 --> 17:59.520
because if you did, you wouldn't
behave in such a cavalier fashion.

17:59.640 --> 18:04.520
A yellow warning? That's only
three steps away from suspension.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.040
- That's the dream.
- Oh, it's not funny.

18:07.280 --> 18:09.280
Oh, it's a little bit funny.

18:11.040 --> 18:12.650
How was your Spanish oral?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.410
Very good.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.600
- You know I don't speak Spanish.
- Shit. I forgot.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.610
Do you understand
why I work my arse off

18:20.760 --> 18:23.360
to send you to the best
private school I can afford?

18:23.840 --> 18:26.840
- Because when I went to school...
- None of the teachers cared.

18:28.080 --> 18:30.640
They didn't.
And we certainly weren't taught extras

18:30.760 --> 18:34.560
like Spanish, or music, or drama,
because what was the point?

18:35.000 --> 18:37.560
We were only going to get knocked up
or work down the Pound Store.

18:37.680 --> 18:39.680
You did get knocked up.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.320
My point is, I knew
that I would prove them wrong

18:43.480 --> 18:45.200
and make something of my life.

18:45.280 --> 18:46.730
Living the dream.

18:46.880 --> 18:51.400
All I'm asking of you, Kat,
is to take these exams seriously.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.360
We're going to use
your predicted grades,

18:53.440 --> 18:56.680
so if you don't, you have no chance
of an offer from any decent university.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.680
- But that's not really what I want...
- This is New York. Shh!

19:01.240 --> 19:04.520
- Hello, Liz Malone speaking.
- Hello, Liz Malone speaking.

19:04.680 --> 19:07.760
- Hello Brigitte, how are you?
- Hello Brigitte, how are you?

19:08.760 --> 19:10.760
Well hasn't the fashion buyer
got back to us yet?

19:33.200 --> 19:35.200
How to manage a professional band

19:46.640 --> 19:50.040
- I'm off to revise with Jane.
- Oh good, send her my love.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.480
And call me if you're going to be late.

19:53.920 --> 19:56.480
Do you think a regular residency
at a single venue

19:56.600 --> 19:59.880
would achieve better momentum
than scattered gigs across town?

20:00.040 --> 20:02.040
I think...

20:03.600 --> 20:06.800
The aorta carries oxygenated blood
away from the heart to the body tissues

20:06.920 --> 20:10.720
and the pulmonary artery
carries blood to the lungs,

20:10.840 --> 20:12.840
to pick up a fresh
supply of oxygen.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.560
I don't know.
Do you have to decide now?

20:17.920 --> 20:20.040
- I'm meeting them tonight.
- Tonight?

20:20.160 --> 20:22.280
- How are you going to revise?
- I'm not.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.010
You have to.

20:24.160 --> 20:26.760
I don't care about exams.

20:27.520 --> 20:30.240
- For real?
- Yeah, for real.

20:31.280 --> 20:34.440
This is a once in a lifetime
opportunity, I can't mess it up.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.560
This is our future.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.410
I need to have a plan in place

20:38.560 --> 20:42.680
so I can convince Alex that I can push
the band past that sticky first base.

20:43.760 --> 20:45.760
I have the answer.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.400
This is a sure thing.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.960
It'll definitely get you past first
base, bang into all that stickiness.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.680
Firstly, you're gross;

20:55.800 --> 21:00.080
And secondly, my interest in Alex
is purely professional.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.840
Good, don't ever make my mistake

21:02.920 --> 21:05.240
of following your heart
instead of your head.

21:05.320 --> 21:07.400
- Look where it got me.
- Here?

21:08.120 --> 21:10.120
With us?

21:10.320 --> 21:13.520
It was summer, 1978.

21:14.040 --> 21:18.600
Eucalyptus blossoms stung
your nostrils like hungry bees.

21:19.240 --> 21:22.680
Casablanca was a dust bowl,
you could hardly move for the heat.

21:22.920 --> 21:27.120
But the earth moved
when I saw her, this girl,

21:27.720 --> 21:33.680
long yellow dress,
hair shining as intensely as the sun,

21:34.360 --> 21:36.360
lips like...

21:37.200 --> 21:38.690
Well that was it.

21:38.840 --> 21:45.640
She was on her way to London, I was on
my way to heartbreak hell, via Gatwick.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.480
And what did I end up with?

21:47.560 --> 21:52.360
Not the girl, not the sunshine,
a kebab van.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.640
Sugar?

21:59.640 --> 22:01.640
KLT Management, Kat speaking.

22:02.040 --> 22:03.170
Hey Kat, it's Alex.

22:03.320 --> 22:07.440
Alex, hi, sorry I didn't get back to
you earlier, hectic day in the office.

22:07.720 --> 22:09.360
That's okay, I know you're busy.

22:09.440 --> 22:11.960
Look, I wanted to cancel with you
coming down to rehearsals tonight.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.440
- Really?
- There's no point.

22:13.560 --> 22:15.560
Why?

22:16.320 --> 22:20.280
Ah, our drummer's just walked out and
joined our ex-manager's new band.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.080
- Anyway, best of luck with everything...
- No, hang on.

22:23.560 --> 22:26.760
I might be able to help.
I know this amazing drummer.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.480
- That's okay, we'll advertise.
- Yes, you should.

22:30.960 --> 22:33.040
But why don't you listen to him first?

22:37.000 --> 22:39.720
- Alex?
- Okay, bring him down.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
- We'll be there from seven.
- Great.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.040
- Later.
- See ya.

22:45.560 --> 22:47.560
A drummer?

22:52.960 --> 22:56.040
Awesome.
An actual band.

22:57.360 --> 22:59.360
Keep it simple like that.

23:01.240 --> 23:03.050
Hey, that sounded great.

23:03.200 --> 23:05.720
- Oh Brian, this is Kat.
- Malone.

23:06.040 --> 23:08.040
She's brought the drummer.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.200
Sid. Hi.

23:11.840 --> 23:13.490
Nice riff, Brian.

23:13.640 --> 23:15.840
Yeah, I think it brings
the chorus back from being too...

23:16.000 --> 23:18.000
Early eighties synth pop?

23:20.120 --> 23:22.120
Yeah.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.290
Is something funny?

23:24.440 --> 23:27.920
No, he's just happy to be here.

23:29.680 --> 23:31.610
So where have you played?

23:31.760 --> 23:33.400
- Brixton.
- Oh, the Academy?

23:33.520 --> 23:34.720
The tube station.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.480
Sorry, I have a small window here,
could we get on with the playing?

23:43.920 --> 23:46.040
- Sid, just come in when you can.
- Yep.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.160
- That's nice work.
- Thanks man.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.240
So?
What do you reckon?

24:20.720 --> 24:22.880
- Do you mind if we take a minute?
- Sure.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.520
- He's the real thing.
- And a sweet guy.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.560
Yeah, I think we should try him
out for a couple of weeks.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.720
Great.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.680
Cool, well thanks for coming.

24:34.760 --> 24:37.600
I think now would be the perfect
time to talk management.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.760
I have a vision for you, your band,
and I've written some stuff up.

24:43.840 --> 24:46.080
Number one, you need
a regular residency,

24:46.160 --> 24:49.600
this builds up a fan base who become
familiar with your songs.

24:49.840 --> 24:51.840
Number two...

24:55.080 --> 24:56.730
It's here, all in here.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.280
Touring is key, I would contact
the right promoters

24:59.440 --> 25:01.440
to get you booked
into the most credible venues,

25:01.640 --> 25:03.680
building momentum
so that when we come back to London,

25:03.800 --> 25:05.800
we can book a really great gig.

25:06.680 --> 25:08.840
Cool, yeah, I mean
the Stones were all about touring.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.520
And Janis Joplin. Have you ever
seen her performance at Woodstock?

25:11.600 --> 25:13.130
Oh yeah, it's so personal

25:13.280 --> 25:14.920
it feels like you shouldn't actually
be listening to it.

25:15.000 --> 25:16.000
Yeah, I know, right.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.680
That's how it should be, that's
why I got into his in the first place,

25:18.800 --> 25:21.120
people who love music,
sharing their music.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.760
Why else do it?

25:22.840 --> 25:25.600
Yeah, it's like, it's like
you always remember where you were

25:25.720 --> 25:27.680
when you first
heard a really great song.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.800
And who you were with.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.080
Anyway, Sid's great...

25:36.240 --> 25:39.480
How about you give me an eight
week trial? See what I can deliver?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.640
- Ah, the manager's...
- Six weeks!

25:42.400 --> 25:44.400
Come on.
What have you got to lose?

25:50.040 --> 25:51.770
Yeah, yeah.

25:51.920 --> 25:54.080
Oh no,
they won't do an early week slot,

25:54.200 --> 25:56.520
we're looking for Thursday
onwards.

25:57.560 --> 25:58.890
I've got another call coming in,

25:59.040 --> 26:02.560
I will take another look at the link
and we'll speak later.

26:41.120 --> 26:42.280
Yeah, I sent you a link last week

26:42.360 --> 26:45.480
and I did think that they would be
really up your street.

26:51.320 --> 26:53.800
You have to hear this,
it's their latest song.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.400
Ooh, is that?

27:02.920 --> 27:04.920
Who does it belong to?

27:07.000 --> 27:09.320
- Marcus?
- He's actually nice.

27:10.000 --> 27:14.080
- He's an arrogant, tiny wet wipe.
- Give it a break.

27:36.520 --> 27:38.520
They're really good.

27:51.280 --> 27:54.160
- Busy?
- Yes, so much to do.

27:55.320 --> 27:58.280
Finally, that's what I've been trying
to tell you the last eight weeks.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.320
Well you've hardly been around
for the last eight weeks.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.680
I might not be here but I'm across
everything you're up to.

28:02.800 --> 28:03.960
You don't know anything.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.760
What I do know is Mr Cato's holding
after school revision on Thursday.

28:06.880 --> 28:09.640
- And I've signed you up.
- Without even asking me?

28:10.360 --> 28:12.360
I'm not going.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.560
You will go and I will check up on you.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I've got work to do.

28:19.440 --> 28:21.440
Good.

28:37.360 --> 28:38.810
Kat Malone speaking?

28:38.960 --> 28:41.480
Hi, this is Ted Bonwell
from the Tumbledown.

28:41.640 --> 28:43.640
We spoke the other day?

28:50.360 --> 28:52.360
Miss Malone!

28:52.720 --> 28:57.440
You're playing the Tumbledown,
7 PM, this Thursday.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.720
Great!

29:17.200 --> 29:19.200
Come hear your new favourite band.

29:24.000 --> 29:26.000
Hey still up for tonight?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.360
It will be awesome, come.

29:42.640 --> 29:44.640
LOST

30:28.720 --> 30:30.960
- Where's your manager?
- She'll be here.

30:31.040 --> 30:33.960
We haven't been this busy in a while.
How did you meet her?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.410
Look at that.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.920
Ah, it was actually more
of a collision really.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.560
Well however it happened, I think
you made a good decision.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.640
She's done a great job.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.600
Sorry I'm late,

30:54.080 --> 30:56.050
I got tied up in the office.

30:56.200 --> 30:57.690
Any problems?

30:57.840 --> 31:00.480
No. I think you've got to start turning
people away.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.080
It's great.

31:13.360 --> 31:14.650
What's going on?

31:14.800 --> 31:16.210
He's ID-ing.

31:16.360 --> 31:17.800
But you've got fake ID right?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.840
Duh, but it says I'm eighteen.

31:19.920 --> 31:21.920
This is a twenty one venue.

31:22.240 --> 31:24.090
What?

31:24.240 --> 31:26.010
All the same old stories.

31:26.160 --> 31:28.160
Kids, eh?

31:30.680 --> 31:33.560
What do we want? Turbo bombs.
When do we want it? Now!

31:34.040 --> 31:37.280
What do we want? Turbo bombs.
When do we want it? Now!

31:37.680 --> 31:40.720
What do we want? Turbo bombs.
When do we want it? Now!

31:41.200 --> 31:44.360
What do we want? Turbo bombs.
When do we want it? Now!

31:44.760 --> 31:46.280
Okay, we're closing the doors.

31:46.360 --> 31:48.040
Whoa, well can we not
just discuss this?

31:48.120 --> 31:50.960
No, we've got a licence to protect.
I need you guys gone.

31:52.400 --> 31:54.050
- Kat?
- Yes?

31:54.200 --> 31:56.200
Ah, let's think solutions.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.450
Kat Malone speaking?

32:05.600 --> 32:07.600
- Are you taking the piss?
- Ah, no.

32:08.280 --> 32:11.920
Good. So I spoke to Mr Cato,
how did you find revision club?

32:12.280 --> 32:15.840
It was an inspiring experience.

32:16.320 --> 32:19.760
Good. And, ah, you going to revise
with Jane now then, or?

32:19.840 --> 32:21.880
- Yeah, yes, yep.
- Yeah, good.

32:21.960 --> 32:23.640
And what time do you think
you'll be back?

32:23.720 --> 32:25.000
Twenty two hundred hours?

32:25.080 --> 32:28.040
Oh no, no, that's too late, I want
you back at nine thirty latest.

32:28.120 --> 32:30.080
That, that, that could work as well.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.170
Alright, see you later.

32:32.320 --> 32:34.320
Great, look forward to it.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.720
Ah, work, so busy.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.840
You're in luck, you've
got the night off.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.690
No I, I don't.

32:42.840 --> 32:45.120
Is that it? Don't?

32:45.720 --> 32:49.400
Is that the sole sum of your problem
solving strategies? Pathetic.

32:50.080 --> 32:53.360
- I did warn you, mate.
- Come on man, it's one mistake.

32:53.840 --> 32:55.530
I've made some, so have you.

32:55.680 --> 32:58.880
Yeah, at hiring greedy,
cheating managers.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.960
She's not the same!

33:02.640 --> 33:04.450
Okay.

33:04.600 --> 33:06.600
So what do we do now then, huh?

33:06.960 --> 33:09.720
Just pack up and go?

33:13.720 --> 33:15.720
Yeah, I suppose.

33:16.680 --> 33:19.560
I have always wanted to play
the Tumbledown though.

33:20.560 --> 33:22.320
Remember at school, coming in here

33:22.440 --> 33:26.120
and you tried to convince the manager
to hear us play at morning assembly?

33:29.360 --> 33:30.400
Yeah.

33:30.520 --> 33:32.800
All our favourite bands
have played here.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.600
Oh it's, it's cheesy.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.760
Oh come on, you owe me.

34:02.960 --> 34:06.600
What did Brian mean,
with the cheating managers thing?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.480
Get out!

34:13.360 --> 34:15.360
Next time an audience, yeah?

34:57.120 --> 34:59.200
START 9:30, FINISH 11:30
E.T. 11:50

35:19.920 --> 35:23.120
DOLLAR DAYS
UPCOMING GIGS

35:24.120 --> 35:26.400
NO DATES AVAILABLE

35:31.600 --> 35:33.720
Hi, my name's Kat Malone, I manage...

35:37.560 --> 35:41.360
I sent you an email yesterday,
I manage Dollar Days.

35:42.640 --> 35:46.360
Any day of the week would be great,
they have a strong following and...

35:46.680 --> 35:50.720
Please, Kat, could you keep it down
or just not be here.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.770
Not be here?

35:54.920 --> 35:57.000
- This is my café.
- Since when?

35:58.320 --> 36:00.520
Well, I found it.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.760
Faz, is this her café?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.520
- Just chill, it's just school.
- As opposed to?

36:07.080 --> 36:09.160
- My career.
- Get real.

36:09.720 --> 36:12.480
It is real. It's more real
than your pathetic life.

36:12.560 --> 36:14.370
Oh Marcus, oh he sent me a text,

36:14.520 --> 36:16.760
oh I'm so excited I'm going
to pee my pants.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.120
Oh, you should listen to yourself.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.720
I should, it's better than listening
to your endless Marcus, oh Marcus.

36:21.800 --> 36:23.610
- You're jealous.
- Enough!

36:23.760 --> 36:27.080
In Casablanca Cave
there is no shouting, no conflict.

36:27.320 --> 36:31.560
There's coffee, tea,
a selection of pastries,

36:32.440 --> 36:36.440
conversation of the most philosophical
and congenial variety,

36:37.840 --> 36:39.840
and music.

36:41.280 --> 36:43.280
You have a music licence?

36:44.360 --> 36:46.360
Of course.

37:05.840 --> 37:08.360
You've done an amazing job
with the decorations.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.960
Thanks.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.010
Faz wants you.

37:13.160 --> 37:15.160
Later.

37:17.960 --> 37:22.000
- Kat, this is Herbie, my cousin.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

37:22.160 --> 37:24.090
So you're the manager
of the band?

37:24.240 --> 37:26.320
- Yep, that's me.
- They're great.

37:26.800 --> 37:30.960
I have this place, food, drinks,
music, I'd love them to play.

37:31.440 --> 37:34.400
- Number one venue in Snowshill.
- Is that on the tube?

37:35.000 --> 37:37.000
The Cotswolds, very pretty.

37:39.080 --> 37:41.080
What do you think?

37:44.680 --> 37:49.400
I think we're kind of busy
with London gigs at the moment.

37:49.480 --> 37:53.480
But it does sound interesting.
How about we exchange details?

38:09.520 --> 38:12.960
Check this out, the Casablanca gig
just hit six thousand views.

38:22.800 --> 38:24.570
I look pretty good.

38:24.720 --> 38:26.720
You look fantastic.

38:31.680 --> 38:33.610
Oh, well that's it then.

38:33.760 --> 38:36.960
Ah, have you seen the Instagram likes?
That's going crazy.

38:37.200 --> 38:39.200
And the next gig, how's that going?

38:39.440 --> 38:42.000
Ah yeah, I'm talking
to some venues.

38:42.680 --> 38:45.040
Good,
that's what we're all about, live gigs.

38:45.160 --> 38:47.160
Always have been.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.960
There is this one venue,
it's cool, but it's in the Cotswolds.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.600
So my band's normally only play it
as part of a west country tour.

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
What do you think?

39:00.920 --> 39:03.320
Well we did talk about
touring last summer.

39:03.640 --> 39:05.010
Sid?

39:05.160 --> 39:09.000
Yeah, I could do with some
spiritual re-energising.

39:10.080 --> 39:11.970
We could play at Stonehenge.

39:12.120 --> 39:14.680
I don't think that's a venue.

39:14.760 --> 39:18.360
- Yeah, we could meet our virtual fans.
- Like the spirits and the ghosts.

39:21.520 --> 39:25.360
I think it's a great idea. Reach out
to a fan base outside of London.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.880
Yeah, if we have one.

39:28.840 --> 39:30.840
Agreed?

39:31.280 --> 39:33.280
Alright, let's do it.

39:49.000 --> 39:52.360
Do you think Bolan ever just
wanted to not put on the war paint

39:52.520 --> 39:54.680
and disappear under a duvet?

39:55.560 --> 39:57.560
If he was human.

39:58.160 --> 40:01.720
I've read a very convincing
theory that he wasn't.

40:02.520 --> 40:04.520
Yes.

40:07.320 --> 40:12.160
Ooh, what's the matter Kitty Kat?

40:14.320 --> 40:16.320
Everything.

40:16.720 --> 40:20.640
Exams, Jane,
she's behaving so weird lately.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.200
I mean just because you fancy a boy

40:22.280 --> 40:25.480
doesn't mean you have
to change your entire personality.

40:25.880 --> 40:28.160
I mean she loves The Slits
as much as I do.

40:28.640 --> 40:32.000
Don't worry, you girls will
be friends for life.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.120
Boys come and go.

40:37.840 --> 40:41.480
But always Jane will be there for you.

40:43.960 --> 40:47.280
- How's it going with the band?
- Okay.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.800
- Have you slept with any of them yet?
- No!

40:49.920 --> 40:52.000
Oh free love is a beautiful thing.

40:53.480 --> 40:59.320
The band want to go on tour and,
well, I don't know how I can do that.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.130
What's stopping you?

41:01.280 --> 41:04.720
Going away, booking gigs, school, mum.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.880
It's... impossible.

41:08.080 --> 41:10.080
Isn't it your dream?

41:12.480 --> 41:14.480
Then you don't have a choice.

41:25.640 --> 41:27.800
Ugh, there's nothing in here.

41:29.000 --> 41:33.280
There's yoghurt, parma ham,
there's coriander humous.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.400
Ugh, who likes that?

41:35.640 --> 41:36.930
Most people.

41:37.080 --> 41:39.800
But I'm not most people!
I'm an individual!

41:39.960 --> 41:42.040
Why doesn't anyone understand that?

41:42.600 --> 41:46.040
I have my own ideas
and thoughts and dreams

41:46.120 --> 41:49.640
and funny enough, they don't involve
listening to talent show bands,

41:49.800 --> 41:54.240
or sleeping with members of the band,
or eating coriander humous.

41:54.920 --> 42:00.120
Well, that's fine. I'm not telling you
to do any of those things.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.200
You're always telling me what to do.

42:02.440 --> 42:04.720
I'm asking you to focus on your exams.

42:05.800 --> 42:09.000
- So important for you.
- No, it's important for you!

42:10.400 --> 42:12.400
I couldn't give a shit.

42:12.920 --> 42:17.320
You want me to do well so you can
show me off, Kat Malone, best in show.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.840
Why don't you just put me on a leash
and be done with it

42:20.000 --> 42:21.320
and then you can swan around at work

42:21.400 --> 42:23.040
and tell everyone
what an amazing mother you are?

42:23.120 --> 42:25.120
Well you're not.

42:32.760 --> 42:36.120
If you're serious about these ideas,
then let's do something about it.

42:36.240 --> 42:38.880
Bullet point it, figure out
how you're going to achieve it.

42:38.960 --> 42:42.080
- You don't understand.
- Ha, I do.

42:42.840 --> 42:46.760
Think about it. Do you want me
to look over them in the morning?

43:13.480 --> 43:15.480
Mum?

43:19.280 --> 43:21.280
Some work problems.

43:22.280 --> 43:26.280
She had to catch an early flight
to New York, she'll be a few weeks.

43:27.800 --> 43:30.080
She didn't want to wake you, darling.

43:36.160 --> 43:38.160
We're going on tour.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.320
I'm taking the band on tour, Gran.

43:43.480 --> 43:44.800
Adios exams!

43:44.880 --> 43:46.920
Two whole weeks away from this dump!

43:48.400 --> 43:49.440
Far away.

43:49.560 --> 43:53.000
It's all set. We're leaving on Sunday,
it will be amazing.

43:53.120 --> 43:55.760
You don't mind sharing a room do you,
save a bit of money?

43:55.880 --> 43:58.640
Can you believe it,
we're taking the band on tour?

43:59.720 --> 44:01.690
I can't go.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.960
- Why not?
- I've made other plans.

44:04.520 --> 44:06.520
Like what?

44:07.200 --> 44:09.840
See you tonight.
And make sure you bring Marcus.

44:15.880 --> 44:18.040
I just want to spend some time
with him.

44:19.360 --> 44:22.880
But he's everything
we've always hated.

44:23.080 --> 44:26.280
- He's an ab zombie!
- He's successful!

44:28.360 --> 44:32.560
Look, we had a lot of fun,
but it was always just a dream.

44:33.280 --> 44:36.480
- We can't really do it, not for real.
- We can.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.400
You get caught out,
it will be a disaster.

44:39.520 --> 44:42.120
It won't. You and Marcus,
that's the disaster.

44:43.880 --> 44:46.640
- Thanks for your support.
- You're the one not supporting me!

44:46.760 --> 44:52.080
Not everything always is about you!
Or Dollar Days! Or Alex!

44:52.680 --> 44:54.600
I have a life and I'm fed up

44:54.720 --> 44:57.000
with having to constantly pretend
to be someone I'm not.

44:57.080 --> 44:59.080
I'm okay with being me!

45:04.840 --> 45:08.280
Oh, table for one is it?

46:25.480 --> 46:27.720
The van is sixty pounds a day?

46:28.680 --> 46:30.960
Okay, thanks, I'll get back to you.

46:35.520 --> 46:38.120
You're not celebrating
the end of exams?

46:38.960 --> 46:43.000
Everyone's celebrating,
with their family, with their friends.

46:44.720 --> 46:46.720
Not me.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.410
Boyfriend?

46:50.560 --> 46:53.760
You know I phoned twenty two places
already, twenty two,

46:53.880 --> 46:55.680
and I still can't find
a van cheap enough

46:55.800 --> 47:00.040
so that I can take the band on a tour
that I somehow stupidly suggested.

47:01.440 --> 47:03.440
Why didn't you say?

47:03.720 --> 47:08.160
Before Casablanca Cave,
there was Fast Faz.

47:09.040 --> 47:10.290
Borrow it!

47:10.440 --> 47:14.120
She still goes, I use her for the Cash
& Carry every other Thursday.

47:15.560 --> 47:17.560
Fast Faz?

47:18.000 --> 47:20.000
Snazzy alliteration.

47:21.840 --> 47:23.840
Thank you.

47:26.440 --> 47:29.040
If anyone can pull this off...

47:37.560 --> 47:39.560
Doesn't really go with our image.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.440
Okay.

47:49.400 --> 47:51.210
Come on, you're driving.

47:51.360 --> 47:53.360
Oh, I can't drive.

47:53.800 --> 47:57.560
I mean I have too many points
on my licence to drive.

47:58.200 --> 47:59.650
Speeding.

47:59.800 --> 48:01.800
I'll drive.

48:06.480 --> 48:09.240
So, apart from Herbie's,
where else have you got lined up?

48:09.360 --> 48:11.250
I rang up a few options.

48:11.400 --> 48:13.400
You know where I'd love to play?

48:14.160 --> 48:16.160
The George & Dragon.

48:16.360 --> 48:19.320
Many broke out from there,
full of record label bands.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.170
Yeah, that's a great idea.

48:21.320 --> 48:24.360
- You spoken to them?
- Yeah, of course, I'm working on it.

48:24.440 --> 48:26.760
Nah, I think someone's
fudging the truth.

48:27.800 --> 48:29.170
Fast Faz?

48:29.320 --> 48:31.360
Yeah, put your foot on it.

48:31.600 --> 48:33.600
Mate, this is it.

48:43.920 --> 48:46.760
Fantastic, I was worried you weren't
going to make it on time.

48:46.840 --> 48:48.840
You weren't the only one.

48:50.400 --> 48:52.360
Hi Herbie, remember me,
I'm Kat Malone?

48:52.440 --> 48:54.440
I'll be dealing
with all matters professional.

48:54.520 --> 48:56.600
Great directions.
Where are we playing?

49:12.200 --> 49:14.280
Ah, no, I don't work
with that promoter,

49:14.360 --> 49:17.240
but if you check them out
on YouTube then you'll see.

49:19.400 --> 49:21.400
Okay, I understand.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.880
- Do you never stop?
- Ah, no.

49:28.080 --> 49:30.200
- What?
- You going to introduce us?

49:30.880 --> 49:31.970
- Me?
- Yeah.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.120
Come on, we're on.

49:45.400 --> 49:48.920
Hi everyone, it's great
to be here tonight in...

49:50.000 --> 49:51.330
Snowshill.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.050
Snowshill.

49:53.200 --> 49:58.280
Please can you give a warm
welcome to Dollar Days!

50:11.680 --> 50:13.570
This is going to be great.

50:13.720 --> 50:16.440
It's beautiful Herbie,
it's going to be brilliant.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.520
Thanks.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.240
Go Dollar Days!

51:26.480 --> 51:28.480
Hello?

51:28.640 --> 51:30.640
Yes, speaking.

51:31.280 --> 51:33.280
The twenty seventh?

51:33.880 --> 51:36.920
They're pretty busy,
let me just check their schedule.

51:41.120 --> 51:44.320
You're in luck, they have an opening
that night. Shall we talk terms?

51:48.640 --> 51:50.640
I've booked your next gig.

51:52.000 --> 51:54.000
Where are we playing?

51:54.320 --> 51:56.680
- Brian, woman present.
- Where?

51:57.960 --> 52:00.800
Oh, me.

52:01.880 --> 52:05.080
Ah, Bloxham, we're playing
in Bloxham, Oxford.

52:05.640 --> 52:08.320
- At the George & Dragon?
- The Humming Hedgehog.

52:09.440 --> 52:12.160
Can we get hotel rooms
in the next place, please?

52:12.720 --> 52:14.690
Ah, I'll see what I can do.

52:14.840 --> 52:17.720
So what's it like,
this Humming Hedgehog?

52:18.280 --> 52:21.680
Oh, full of industry types,
it's a seriously cool crowd.

52:24.640 --> 52:27.720
- Barry Manilow.
- Neil Diamond.

52:28.040 --> 52:29.770
- Elton John.
- Kat?

52:29.920 --> 52:32.440
- Simply Red.
- They want us to sing cover songs.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.160
- It's a request covers night.
- Gypsy Kings.

52:36.360 --> 52:38.800
- Is there food after?
- Yes.

52:40.520 --> 52:43.520
Come on, covers can be cool.
White Stripes done Dylan.

52:43.640 --> 52:46.200
- Neil Diamond!
- Barry Manilow!

52:46.480 --> 52:48.130
Dire Straits.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.440
Look this sort of thing,
it happens on tour.

52:51.680 --> 52:53.680
Yeah, it does to us.

52:53.880 --> 52:57.120
Okay, I admit,
it was a badly drawn up...

52:57.240 --> 53:01.360
- Badly Drawn Boy!
- Yeah, Badly Drawn Boy.

53:06.120 --> 53:08.120
Badly Drawn Boy?

53:12.240 --> 53:14.880
- A to B?
- If you take that first bit.

53:21.840 --> 53:26.240
Ah, yes, I need four rooms
for tonight please.

53:30.320 --> 53:32.640
Five hundred and forty pounds?

53:35.200 --> 53:37.200
I'll get back to you.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.640

54:08.960 --> 54:10.960
Get off the stage.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.650
Get off!

54:21.800 --> 54:23.800
- Don't come back!
- Sorry.

54:28.200 --> 54:30.200
I promised you food, didn't I?

54:41.080 --> 54:43.440
I am just going to get some coins.

54:52.040 --> 54:54.040
- Hi?
- Hello?

54:54.320 --> 54:56.440
- Can I speak to Kat Malone?
- You could.

54:56.560 --> 55:00.360
- Sorry?
- Well normally, but she's not here.

55:01.680 --> 55:06.040
- And where is here?
- Good question. I think we're at...

55:06.440 --> 55:08.440
Hello?

55:11.680 --> 55:13.680
He was a bit drunk.

55:13.960 --> 55:16.680
Yeah. I knew it, you're out
drinking, aren't you?

55:16.840 --> 55:20.120
- Yes, yes, I'm sorry mum.
- Right.

55:20.600 --> 55:22.360
I want you straight home,
check in on Gran

55:22.440 --> 55:24.880
and then up to bed and
we'll talk about this when I return.

55:26.520 --> 55:29.000
She's not delivered.
We should fire her.

55:32.640 --> 55:35.560
But maybe she's got something
amazing up her sleeve.

55:36.880 --> 55:38.210
It's possible.

55:38.360 --> 55:41.320
Why don't we just ask her?
See if she's got anything else booked.

55:41.520 --> 55:44.520
So you're listening to him now?
He's been here, what, five minutes?

55:44.600 --> 55:46.600
We were doing fine as we were.

55:55.520 --> 55:59.480
Okay. How about we just give her
another week?

56:02.600 --> 56:05.400
Can't you just do something productive
with your holidays?

56:05.520 --> 56:07.240
There's a short course
running at the tech.

56:07.320 --> 56:08.320
No.

56:08.400 --> 56:12.040
No listen, listen,
it's for young entrepreneurs,

56:12.160 --> 56:14.840
I thought after our chat,
it might be of interest.

56:15.400 --> 56:18.960
You know, that does
sound quite interesting.

56:19.920 --> 56:22.320
- Well, do you want me to book it?
- I'll do it.

56:22.640 --> 56:23.960
Do you have your credit card details?

56:24.040 --> 56:27.000
Of course, well,
I'm glad you're so keen.

56:27.160 --> 56:29.160
I am.

56:30.320 --> 56:32.320
It means everything to me.

56:39.040 --> 56:41.040
It just needs powder.

56:42.880 --> 56:45.520
Oh, you should see the hotel
I've booked, it looks awesome.

56:45.640 --> 56:48.680
I want you guys to get a good
night's sleep, busy days ahead.

56:48.840 --> 56:51.200
Where?
Where are we being busy?

56:52.960 --> 56:55.520
I've got some interesting
potential venues.

56:55.600 --> 56:57.600
Like what?

57:04.160 --> 57:06.160
Scala.

57:07.040 --> 57:09.040
That's great.

57:09.840 --> 57:11.840
What is it?

57:12.920 --> 57:17.160
Ah, the ultimate mass music event,
and it's being live streamed.

57:17.280 --> 57:18.280
Who's playing?

57:18.360 --> 57:22.600
All the most credible emerging artists.
It's a great showcase.

57:24.520 --> 57:26.520
- Cool.
- See?

57:27.880 --> 57:29.880
I know what I'm doing guys.

57:35.800 --> 57:37.650
No!

57:37.800 --> 57:39.610
No!

57:39.760 --> 57:41.760
He's nicked our clothes!

57:44.000 --> 57:46.800
I thought there was no crime
in the Cotswolds.

57:49.960 --> 57:53.040
- Oh we can buy new clothes.
- You can buy them.

57:53.680 --> 57:55.920
That's what I mean,
I can buy new clothes.

57:56.760 --> 57:58.160
In fact, before our next gig,

57:58.240 --> 58:01.240
I wanted to talk to you guys
about your style, as a band.

58:02.080 --> 58:04.080
It's...

58:06.160 --> 58:08.160
You need a fresh look.

58:09.360 --> 58:11.360
Trust me!

58:36.040 --> 58:37.930
The George & Dragon.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.840
I breathe it, I become it.

58:43.680 --> 58:45.680
Can you start unloading the van?

58:46.120 --> 58:48.120
Girl done good.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.480
TONIGHT DOLLAR DAYS
CANCELLED

59:09.160 --> 59:10.690
Can I help you?

59:10.840 --> 59:12.840
I'm Kat Malone,
manager of the band.

59:13.680 --> 59:16.840
- Didn't expect you to turn up.
- What's the problem?

59:16.920 --> 59:20.120
The credit card details
you gave us for the deposit.

59:20.800 --> 59:23.600
- Yes?
- Well the bank's investigating.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.720
It believes the card has been cloned.

59:27.200 --> 59:32.120
The owner, the real owner,
has been contacted.

59:39.400 --> 59:41.800
First name George, surname Anddragon.

59:41.880 --> 59:43.880
- Oh, I get it.
- It's like the George & Dragon.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.000
There's been a mix up.

59:47.240 --> 59:49.240
We're not playing tonight.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.650
A mix up?

59:51.800 --> 59:54.600
But I checked their webpage,
we're playing.

59:55.040 --> 59:57.480
- We're not.
- What kind of mix up?

59:58.400 --> 59:59.440
Yours?

59:59.560 --> 01:00:03.520
28th of October,
Dollar Days, cancelled.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:07.840
I'm sorry guys, I'm so sorry.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:11.200
We're still playing the Scala.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.080
- Are we?
- Well...

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:16.800
Don't bullshit, I've checked
the website and we're not even on it.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:49.680
I put myself on the line for you.
The guys, they trust me.

01:00:50.520 --> 01:00:53.960
I'm trying to keep this band together,
it's a huge responsibility.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.160
- I know.
- Do you?

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:00.000
Back then Brian wanted to fire you and
it was me who pushed for you to stay.

01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:02.610
I believed in you.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.760
Was that a mistake?

01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:09.010
I don't know.

01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.640
You have to know, you need
to really, really want this. It's hard.

01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:17.160
That's why people take the easy route
with the talent shows

01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.280
and not playing live.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:25.800
- But that's not who we are, is it?
- I don't always know exactly who I am.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.160
You're our manager.

01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:33.280
But managers who get too close
are managers who get fired.

01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.560
What do you mean?

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.600
Our last manager, we worked together,
planning it out,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.680
we wanted the same things,
just a bit too much.

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.680
But how can it be too much?
Surely that's a good thing.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.760
He wanted my girlfriend
so he took her.

01:01:58.480 --> 01:02:00.480
Now they're together.

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.480
Come on, let's get a drink.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:11.240
I'll see if I can buy you some time,
but they ain't happy.

01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:14.320
You better
sort something fast, alright?

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.040
Yeah, response has been solid.

01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.120
The audiences love them.

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:29.650
Great.

01:02:29.800 --> 01:02:31.960
- How's it going with Marcus?
- So good.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.400
They're playing a gig
at Scala tomorrow.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.730
Cool.

01:02:36.880 --> 01:02:39.360
Yeah, the band are playing
a gig right now.

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:40.850
Awesome.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.600
Yeah, sorry, it's
probably a bit noisy.

01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.120
Shame you're not here,
I could have got you in tomorrow.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.280
Marcus always wants me at his gigs.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.920
- Kat, I...
- Yes?

01:02:54.600 --> 01:02:56.600
I'll see you back at school.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.400
Yeah, see you then.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.560
We need to talk.

01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.690
Come on, get up.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.440
Can you stop doing whatever it is that
you're doing for like one minute...

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.920
You want to fire me?
Get on with it, just fire me.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.480
Hey, why would I want to do that?

01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:38.640
I mean I've made some pretty dumb
decisions in the past,

01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:41.960
but even I wouldn't fire the girl
who's relentless, headstrong,

01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:47.400
unappreciated hard work has just
got our band one million hits.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.010
What?

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.440
The video you posted,
Journey From A to B.

01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:54.810
Badly Drawn Boy's
just put it up on his Twitter page

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960
saying,
check this out, it's fresh.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.120
We've gone viral!

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:07.680
I'm sure you do want them to play,
but I'm weighing up options

01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:10.720
and I can't commit
until I speak to them personally.

01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.320
Look, I have
my own shit to deal with.

01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.000
Yes, but they're asleep
in their hotel at the moment,

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:22.200
so, I will get back to you
as soon as they're up.

01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.450
Coffee anyone?

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:31.600
- Go away.
- No?

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:33.490
Okay.

01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.520
Scala anyone?

01:04:38.280 --> 01:04:39.280
Us?

01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:42.520
And Badly Drawn Boy,
he wants you as his support act!

01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.720
- Need anything?
- What are you listening to?

01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:12.440
It's 1958, the Beatles
first ever recording.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:14.530
In Spite Of All The Danger,

01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.920
written by McCartney and Harrison
when they were only fifteen.

01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:22.240
Now listen to this.

01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:27.120
It's 1963, it's five years later,

01:05:27.280 --> 01:05:30.760
they now have Ringo and Lennon's
just written Please Please Me.

01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:35.040
Alan Williams was their first manager.

01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:39.280
He heard them play but he
didn't listen, not like really listen,

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.120
he couldn't see what they could be.

01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:45.720
Brian Epstein, he could,
he had this, like, sixth sense.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:48.200
Mm, the potential.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.330
The potential.

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:52.840
Everyone's good at something,

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:57.360
it's just most people don't get
listened to, not hard enough.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:03.200
Mum: My plane's just landed.
I'm on my way home. We need to talk.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.000
When Epstein died, do you know
what Paul McCartney said?

01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:11.680
If ever there were a fifth member
of the Beatles, it was Mr. Epstein.

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.040
- That's cool.
- Very cool. Very, very, very cool.

01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:41.080
We're the second band on,
so we should be alright.

01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:42.530
It's not far.

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.960
Watch this, I'll get us there on time.

01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:47.440
Yeah, in time for last orders.

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:50.720
If I'm driving so slow,
why is the engine smoking?

01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:54.640
- Yeah, right.
- No seriously, it's really smoking.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.690
- Sid!
- I thought you filled it up?

01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.170
- I did!
- With what?

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:10.050
Diesel.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.280
It's petrol, it runs on petrol.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:16.960
What we going to do now?

01:07:17.080 --> 01:07:18.680
I used to have a job
in an ice cream van.

01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:20.240
I'll sort it, I will sort it.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.680
Mr. Freezy Tops
definitely ran on diesel.

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.080
Kat, we can't miss this!

01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.410
Grab the gear.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.920
- We're going to leg it.
- What about the drums?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.400
I'll come back
for anything we can't carry.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.160
Come on!

01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:43.400
We're with Jane,
we're supposed to go backstage.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:46.120
- I don't have any tickets here.
- This is a joke.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:48.280
There's nothing here for you.

01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:52.560
There's no backstage passes.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.520
Looks like Marcus
doesn't want you there.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.040
Come on! Come on!

01:08:43.680 --> 01:08:45.920
So no Kat, with no drums?

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:48.600
Any ideas?

01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:51.770
Sid!

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.920
I'm visualising drums.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.000
- Oh man.
- Is there anyone we can borrow off?

01:09:05.720 --> 01:09:09.439
Yeah, no problem bro.
I'll send the manager over now.

01:09:10.160 --> 01:09:12.160
- His name is Karl.
- Karl?

01:09:12.359 --> 01:09:15.279
- Yeah, yeah, he'll sort it for you.
- Thanks a lot man.

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.319
Well you can stop visualising.

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.569
It worked.

01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:25.000
They've got the drums,
they're on stage.

01:09:36.399 --> 01:09:38.760
- Thanks man, appreciate it.
- No problem.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:41.240
If there's anything else,
there's my card.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:46.080
Alright guys...

01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:59.520
Hello Scala!

01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.840
We're so happy to be here, it's been
quite a journey, but we're here.

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:13.760
So please can you give
a warm welcome to Dollar Days!

01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.000
- Thank you so much for this.
- No worries, pleasure.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:52.760
Thank you! And now for someone
who needs no introduction,

01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:55.520
please welcome Badly Drawn Boy!

01:13:02.640 --> 01:13:04.010
Hello London!

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:05.960
Mate, did you hear them
shouting my name?

01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:07.040
They all love you.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.440
There's always
that one member of the band

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:10.920
that breaks out
to become the heart throb.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:13.600
So I've got you an interview slot
with BBC Radio London.

01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:16.520
You need to be at their studio by nine.

01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.640
Got it.

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.040
Oh, and can you make sure Sid
doesn't say anything strange?

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:23.530
Too strange?

01:13:23.680 --> 01:13:26.040
- Can you not just enjoy this moment?
- I am.

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:30.560
- Just look over there.
- Oh my god, the numbers are going up.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.160
- I'm not sure if it is a...
- Stop! Who cares?

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:36.120
I'm not the one with seven hundred
and fifty eight thousand people

01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.010
looking at pictures of me.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.240
Wow.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.090
Yes, wow.

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.280
In fact, I'm going to take
a photo now, I need an update.

01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:49.810
Why are you smiling?

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.370
Because I'm happy.

01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:53.010
No, I don't want happy.

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:54.970
You look too approachable.

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:58.120
Imagine you're thinking
about organelles and cell theory.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.360
Much better.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:07.280
See, it's not enough to be good
looking, you need to be mysterious.

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.920
You think I'm good looking.

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:13.280
You are in the room.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:20.880
I mean that if good looking
is a room then you're in it.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:29.160
The doorway,
definitely in the doorway good looking.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.000
- Kat!
- Jane.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.000
I heard the band play,
they were amazing.

01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:41.320
- Thanks for the backstage pass, Kat.
- Where's Marcus?

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.400
You've made me look like
a complete tit.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:47.680
I told all my friends on Pink Chat
I had a backstage pass.

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:49.800
You are such a little virgin.

01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:54.720
Look! Hi, can we get a selfie?

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.810
Sure.

01:14:56.960 --> 01:14:58.890
Thanks.

01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.520
I knew she couldn't keep
a hold of a fitty like him.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:05.960
Thanks,
that's going straight on my story.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:09.920
Yeah, Jane dumped because she's such
a weave she wouldn't even...

01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:12.010
Back off, frog face.

01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:13.200
And you, you post one word

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.280
and I will shove those crappy hair
extensions of yours right up your arse.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:20.160
I thought Scala had
an entrance policy, no weirdos.

01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:22.440
Do you guys know each other?

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.080
We are not friends,
we're at school together.

01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:28.800
She's in my class,
A Level Spanish, that's all.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.160
School?

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.800
Kat?

01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.360
You're a schoolgirl?

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:45.640
And... And a manager.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.520
You've been lying to us,
right from the start?

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.450
You've been deliberately
making up all of this?

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.080
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

01:15:56.520 --> 01:16:00.760
I thought, in this industry of bullshit
and dishonesty and ego,

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:05.000
I'd finally found someone
who was smart, genuine and funny.

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:07.480
But you,
you're just exactly the same.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:10.960
You know what, no, no, actually,
no, you're not, you're worse.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:15.760
Because you made me believe that
somehow I wasn't the only one that,

01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.960
that I wasn't alone
in all of this.

01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000
You're fake, Kat Malone.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.880
He's not responding to my texts.

01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:36.010
What did you write?

01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.320
Well I was reminding him
about the radio interview.

01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.280
Maybe you should try
something a bit more personal.

01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:49.920
So what happened with Marcus?

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.520
It was fun to begin with.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:17:00.760
He made me feel,
I don't know, like really special.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.130
Then it got heavy.

01:17:05.280 --> 01:17:07.600
I should never have
pushed you together.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.040
Don't be silly, it was our game.

01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.960
Somehow it became real.

01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:18.680
And I couldn't be the girl he wanted.

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.760
I just wasn't ready.

01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.040
I'm so sorry.

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:32.280
I think you're the coolest girl I know.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:40.690
I have an idea.

01:17:40.840 --> 01:17:42.330
What?

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:45.120
When we get back,
shall we go out one night

01:17:45.400 --> 01:17:47.760
and we can pretend to be just us?

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:50.680
Okay.

01:17:52.240 --> 01:17:55.320
Oh god, she's going to kill me!
She's back early,

01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:58.880
I think she knows it's me who's
been spending zillions on her card.

01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:03.200
You should face it.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.560
Before you say anything,
please show me mercy.

01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:13.290
You need to come home now.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:15.440
You know where I am?

01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:19.160
Gran's in hospital, she needs you.
You've got to come home now.

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:27.400
So this evening I'm really happy
to have here in the studio,

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:31.240
straight from performing
with Badly Drawn Boy, Dollar Days.

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:33.600
- Hi guys, welcome.
- Hello, how you doing?

01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.480
So you've played Scala.
Where else can we expect to see you?

01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:41.000
Ah, we're going to be supporting
the Risk Factor on tour.

01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.690
Is that an exclusive?

01:18:42.840 --> 01:18:45.400
Ah, yeah it is,
ah, we've just been confirmed.

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:47.370
We've known the guys for a while

01:18:47.520 --> 01:18:51.000
and now that we share
the same management, it makes sense.

01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.520
- Great.
- Thanks for having us.

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.120
They've dropped me.

01:19:08.680 --> 01:19:12.960
I just wanted to bring her
a few things, some personal things,

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:17.600
the hospital room is, so stark.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.080
What happened?

01:19:27.600 --> 01:19:33.800
She fell and then she lay there,
by herself, for over a day.

01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:41.640
Where were you?

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:46.400
If I'd been here none
of this would have happened,

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.160
Gran would have called
and I would have run down.

01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:56.080
She was here alone and in pain.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.960
You need to start making
better choices.

01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.120
Not for me, for you.

01:20:12.760 --> 01:20:14.760
Mum...

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.800
I want to tell you
where I've been.

01:20:29.840 --> 01:20:31.840
I'm here.

01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:37.520
I'm sorry about your gran.

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:40.080
We're hoping she'll be out of hospital
by the end of the week

01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.120
and we can look
after her from home.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.280
More hot water? Pastries?

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.560
I got it all wrong.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:56.920
I let everyone down,
Gran, you, mum, the band.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.730
Me?

01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.360
How am I supposed to get to the Cash
& Carry on Thursday? I've got no van.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:08.250
I'm so sorry, Faz.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:09.850
I'll sort it.

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.330
What can I do?

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:13.480
Do what you're good at.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:17.640
Weren't you organising
some exam results concert?

01:21:17.880 --> 01:21:23.120
Oh that'll be lame, all the acts,
they're just school kids.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.240
Just school kids?

01:21:29.480 --> 01:21:32.760
Okay.
I suppose I shouldn't let them down.

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.200
I'll do it.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:40.080
Thanks.

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.920
So, right now, who has my van?

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.240
- The band.
- You got Alex's number?

01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:53.200
I think it's time we got it back.

01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.800
END OF EXAMS CONCERT

01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:09.930
Kat Malone!

01:22:10.080 --> 01:22:11.570
Mr. Cato.

01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.720
What did you get?

01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.520
Two D's and a C.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.240
The C was for music.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:23.360
You're so much brighter than that.

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.680
Not to worry,
let's figure out what went wrong

01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:30.040
and I'll organise a meeting
with your other teachers

01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:32.160
and we'll turn those grades around.

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.800
We've still got six months.

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:06.520
Hi, I'm looking for Mr. Faz,
I'm here to return his van.

01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:08.880
He gave me this address.

01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:38.450
Are you Mr. Faz?

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.600
I've got his van.

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.320
I am not Mr. Faz.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.960
Then tell me,
exactly who are you?

01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.320
I am just a schoolgirl,

01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.200
but a schoolgirl who loves music
more than anything in the whole world

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:08.240
and who lied to you more than anyone
has ever in the whole world.

01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:11.320
And I don't know
how to make that right.

01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:19.560
Where would we be
if we hadn't have met you?

01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:22.160
We'd still be trundling along,

01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:26.200
playing the same circuit of clubs
that we always had been,

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.920
with our four hundred
and twelve followers.

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.000
Three hundred and seventy two.

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:35.600
Three hundred
and seventy two followers.

01:24:36.440 --> 01:24:40.600
Me pretending everything's alright,
everything's alright with the band,

01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:45.880
everything's alright with me,
when it most definitely wasn't.

01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:50.880
You weren't the only one lying.

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:57.280
And look at us now,
we've got over a million followers,

01:24:57.880 --> 01:25:00.600
playing the crowds
we could have never have dreamt off,

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:03.400
sharing our music and it's all real.

01:25:04.160 --> 01:25:06.160
And that's all because of you.

01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:08.680
You had something to do with it.

01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:13.040
Well we all did, all of us,
we did it together.

01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:19.400
If anyone was the fourth
member of the band, it was you.

01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920
A concert?

01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.440
Better get going.

01:26:26.080 --> 01:26:29.240
Thank you and now,
for one night only, please welcome...

01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:31.560
Dollar Days!

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.810
Thank you!

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:35.040
Thank you for having us back

01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.320
at a venue that is very, very special
to us, the Casablanca Cave.

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.560
And a very special thank you
to Mr. Faz.

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:47.840
Without you, man,
we wouldn't have been here.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:53.840
This next song is very special to me,

01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:56.160
it's one of the first songs
I ever wrote.

01:26:56.240 --> 01:26:58.240
This song's for you, Kat.

01:27:13.080 --> 01:27:15.080
Are you okay?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.800
THE END

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:25.880
You have to hear this.

01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:27.730
Can we go again?

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:29.880
You have to hear this.

01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:33.920
Let's do it again.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:45.800
Do you understand
why I work my arse off

01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:48.760
to send you to the best private school
I can afford?

01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:50.890
Because when I went to school...

01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:53.080
It's alright,
I drank at the wrong time.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.680
I bet Bowie never had a r...
Sorry.

01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:06.480
I bet Bowie never had

I just can't do it, I just can't do it
in the scene. Funny that.

01:29:34.600 --> 01:29:36.600
What the hell did you fill it up with?

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.560

Guys, I want to thank you so much.

01:32:10.360 --> 01:32:13.320
That's a wrap for today.
See you back in London.
