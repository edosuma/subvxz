Subtitles by explosiveskull

00:28.060 --> 00:28.892
In the West,

00:28.894 --> 00:30.659
the Royals can
clinch that division

00:30.661 --> 00:32.095
with a win over the Angels.

00:32.097 --> 00:35.565
Last night's one-nothing
squeaker game, the Royals.

00:35.567 --> 00:37.868
And once you get
a good rub on that loin,

00:37.870 --> 00:39.035
it's all about smokin' it.

00:39.037 --> 00:41.170
And how long do you
normally smoke it?

00:41.172 --> 00:44.007
Well, I smoke it
till it can't smoke no more.

00:44.009 --> 00:44.974
One, nothing lead.

00:44.976 --> 00:46.977
Good morning, Los Angeles

00:46.979 --> 00:49.413
and welcome to the
Mystic Morning Show.

00:49.415 --> 00:50.679
As always on Saturday mornings,

00:50.681 --> 00:53.916
we have The Amazing
Fabular in studios

00:53.918 --> 00:56.886
taking your calls and
enlightening us all

00:56.888 --> 00:58.989
with his psychic powers.

00:58.991 --> 01:02.024
First up, we have
Chaz from Mar Vista.

01:02.026 --> 01:03.459
Good morning, Chaz.

01:03.461 --> 01:04.727
Mornin'.

01:04.730 --> 01:06.695
What can
Fabular do for you?

01:06.697 --> 01:09.698
Well, I'd just like to
know where my dog Petey is.

01:09.700 --> 01:14.706
He went missin' about three
weeks ago and I really miss him.

01:17.443 --> 01:18.845
I'm seeing a dog.

01:20.545 --> 01:23.079
A medium-sized dog.

01:23.081 --> 01:25.781
Oh, he was
pretty big, actually.

01:25.783 --> 01:29.554
Yes, a medium large dog.

01:32.458 --> 01:34.191
Who's the B?

01:36.128 --> 01:38.127
I'm getting a strong sense of B.

01:38.129 --> 01:39.028
Who's the B?

01:39.030 --> 01:39.995
My wife!

01:39.997 --> 01:41.498
My wife's name is Barbara!

01:41.500 --> 01:42.101
Yes.

01:43.501 --> 01:46.035
She is upset that
the dog is lost.

01:46.037 --> 01:49.972
Oh, no, she
didn't like the dog at all.

01:49.974 --> 01:51.775
And by that, I
mean she is upset

01:51.777 --> 01:55.078
with you that the dog is lost.

01:55.080 --> 01:56.813
Yep, she wants me
to give up on him.

01:56.815 --> 01:58.081
But you mustn't.

01:58.083 --> 02:00.183
No, no, that's right.

02:05.790 --> 02:08.023
I've got great news
for you, Charles.

02:08.025 --> 02:09.157
Chaz.

02:09.160 --> 02:12.027
Charles, Petey is on his
way home to you right now.

02:12.029 --> 02:12.862
Really?

02:12.864 --> 02:13.796
That's great.

02:13.798 --> 02:16.932
Thank you, thank you, Fabular!

02:16.934 --> 02:19.201
I don't create what I see.

02:19.203 --> 02:21.003
I am merely the messenger.

02:21.005 --> 02:22.171
I'm comin', Petey!

02:22.173 --> 02:25.140
Thanks for the call, Chaz,
and good luck with Petey.

02:25.142 --> 02:29.145
Next up we have Tim Tai
Choi from Monterey Park.

02:29.147 --> 02:31.781
What can Fabular do for you?

02:31.783 --> 02:33.216
Yeah, hello.

02:33.218 --> 02:36.520
I want to ask, Mr. Fabular.

02:36.522 --> 02:41.126
Where you get off telling my
wife that I am cheating on her!

02:41.626 --> 02:45.628
The truth is liberating
but also very painful.

02:45.630 --> 02:46.263
Liberating?

02:46.265 --> 02:48.598
What liberating?

02:48.600 --> 02:50.567
You ruined my wife,

02:50.569 --> 02:52.269
- you ruined my life...
- Let it out.

02:52.271 --> 02:54.069
- Let the pain out.
- And my marriage!

02:54.071 --> 02:56.840
All right, next
up on line three,

02:56.842 --> 03:01.711
we have Josephine
from Rancho Cucamonga!

03:01.713 --> 03:04.717
Good
morning, Fabular.

03:05.850 --> 03:07.283
Fabular?

03:07.285 --> 03:08.119
Fabular?

03:10.655 --> 03:12.123
Hello?

03:13.791 --> 03:15.057
Maybe now might be a good time

03:15.059 --> 03:17.159
to take a short commercial break

03:17.161 --> 03:21.900
while Fabular
takes a meditation.

03:22.166 --> 03:24.099
You okay, buddy?

03:26.137 --> 03:26.973
You okay?

03:29.607 --> 03:30.242
Mason.

03:44.155 --> 03:45.588
She's all yours, Jimmy.

03:45.590 --> 03:46.855
Sure thing, Mr. Pearson.

03:46.857 --> 03:48.692
And thanks for
that tip last week.

03:48.694 --> 03:50.794
Did I give you a
big tip last week?

03:50.796 --> 03:52.162
Oh, the advice.

03:52.164 --> 03:53.028
How'd that go?

03:53.030 --> 03:55.365
She broke up with me.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.167
I see.

03:58.202 --> 03:59.304
Keep the change.

04:01.072 --> 04:01.706
Thanks.

04:05.309 --> 04:07.310
Hey, it's the I Hate Kids guy!

04:07.312 --> 04:08.547
My god.

04:09.247 --> 04:10.980
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's me.

04:10.982 --> 04:12.147
This is so cool!

04:12.149 --> 04:14.283
I have been waiting
here all day.

04:14.285 --> 04:15.618
Will you sign this for me?

04:15.620 --> 04:17.386
Yeah, of course.

04:17.387 --> 04:19.855
Man, you are a total genius.

04:19.857 --> 04:21.091
Oh!

04:21.093 --> 04:24.026
It's like you're
inside my head.

04:24.028 --> 04:26.629
When I found out I was
gonna have that one,

04:26.631 --> 04:30.199
I sat in my garage and tried
to think of ways to end it all.

04:30.201 --> 04:31.668
Well, the book's really
more tongue in cheek

04:31.670 --> 04:33.269
for those who choose
not to have kids.

04:33.271 --> 04:34.704
Exactly!

04:34.706 --> 04:36.338
You totally blew my mind!

04:36.340 --> 04:38.074
I was like, if I
ever meet this guy,

04:38.076 --> 04:40.076
we are gonna be best friends

04:40.078 --> 04:44.014
'cause having kids is
beyond life ruining

04:44.016 --> 04:45.247
and you get it, bro.

04:45.249 --> 04:46.151
You get it!

04:47.319 --> 04:48.321
Here ya go

04:51.122 --> 04:52.422
Oh, yeah!

04:52.424 --> 04:53.259
Wow.

04:54.158 --> 04:55.124
That's enough.

04:55.126 --> 04:56.158
Thanks, buddy, that's enough.

04:56.160 --> 04:57.596
Okay, I gotta.

04:59.364 --> 05:00.396
Great meeting you.

05:00.398 --> 05:01.701
Take care, kids.

05:05.136 --> 05:06.435
Hey!

05:06.437 --> 05:07.403
You know who that is?

05:07.405 --> 05:08.607
You know who that is?

05:10.042 --> 05:12.809
A little late,
aren't we, Nick?

05:12.811 --> 05:14.076
Yeah, I'm a
little late, Walter.

05:14.078 --> 05:15.278
I'm a little late.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.881
I'm gonna need a shot
of liquid courage.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.348
What do you suggest?

05:19.350 --> 05:21.785
Well, if you were 15
minutes late, I'd say wine

05:21.787 --> 05:24.386
but since you've crossed
over the lateness equator,

05:24.388 --> 05:26.923
I think we're
looking at bourbon.

05:26.925 --> 05:29.225
It's your professionalism
I admire, Walter.

05:29.227 --> 05:30.262
Bourbon, it is.

05:31.696 --> 05:32.331
Perfect.

05:33.732 --> 05:35.331
You know, I finally
finished your book

05:35.333 --> 05:37.966
and I caught you on Kelly
and Ryan the other day.

05:37.968 --> 05:39.302
You're making quite a
stir with this whole

05:39.304 --> 05:41.271
I Hate Kids thing.

05:41.273 --> 05:42.439
Mm-hmm.

05:42.441 --> 05:44.440
Kelly wasn't having any of it.

05:44.442 --> 05:45.408
No, she certainly was not.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.046
No, she wasn't.

05:48.213 --> 05:49.144
Luckily I have
a woman back here

05:49.146 --> 05:51.650
who is more than okay with it.

05:53.218 --> 05:55.354
Better not keep her waiting.

05:57.021 --> 05:58.089
Wish me luck.

06:00.258 --> 06:01.160
Good luck.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.262
Sorry I'm late, folks.

06:07.264 --> 06:09.932
You know how these book
tour press junkets go.

06:09.934 --> 06:11.302
Hey, Mom, hey, Dad.

06:12.470 --> 06:13.970
Hey, bro.

06:13.972 --> 06:14.803
Hi, Kelly.

06:14.805 --> 06:15.439
Oh.

06:19.311 --> 06:20.242
You're lucky I love you.

06:20.244 --> 06:21.511
You do know what will happen

06:21.513 --> 06:22.812
if you're late to the
actual wedding, right?

06:22.814 --> 06:24.012
Of course.

06:24.014 --> 06:27.516
That's why I had my lawyer
make you executor of the will.

06:27.518 --> 06:29.886
Well, I know that we
just wanna thank you all

06:29.888 --> 06:32.756
for being here with us
on this special occasion.

06:32.758 --> 06:37.363
I wanna make a toast to the
bravest woman I have ever met.

06:38.429 --> 06:40.129
Anyone who can get hitched

06:40.131 --> 06:44.434
to such a humongous bag of hot
air is truly one of a kind.

06:46.470 --> 06:48.437
So here's to Sydney's mom.

06:51.910 --> 06:54.076
Sorry, Phil, I couldn't resist.

06:54.078 --> 06:55.545
Jeez!

06:55.547 --> 06:56.646
Reverend!

06:56.648 --> 06:58.514
And Nick does not consider
the evening a success

06:58.516 --> 07:01.985
unless bourbon comes out of
Reverend McGooley's nose.

07:01.987 --> 07:04.254
Sorry, reverend,
it's the good stuff.

07:04.256 --> 07:06.221
We're off to a great start.

07:06.223 --> 07:07.557
Here we go, folks.

07:07.559 --> 07:08.891
- Hang in there.
- Are you okay?

07:08.893 --> 07:10.459
All right.

07:10.461 --> 07:11.394
He's good.

07:14.266 --> 07:17.266
Okay, my turn.

07:17.268 --> 07:24.275
When I first met Nick last year,
I was moderately impressed.

07:25.477 --> 07:28.478
He is clever, he is
devilishly handsome

07:28.480 --> 07:30.280
and handsomely devilish.

07:30.282 --> 07:33.516
He keeps me laughing and
he is smart enough to know

07:33.518 --> 07:36.019
when he has lost an argument.

07:36.021 --> 07:39.055
But I knew that he was
the man of my dreams

07:39.057 --> 07:43.158
when he spoke these three
precious words to me.

07:43.160 --> 07:44.593
I hate kids.

07:48.133 --> 07:49.064
What?

07:49.066 --> 07:52.037
Well, we're having a baby, so.

07:53.037 --> 07:56.271
And since my brave and
very beautiful sister Kelly

07:56.273 --> 07:59.108
is handling the creation
of grandchildren,

07:59.110 --> 08:00.944
it frees Nick and I up to pursue

08:00.946 --> 08:03.612
a much less complicated
life together.

08:03.614 --> 08:06.249
Besides, over the years I've
managed to kill a hamster,

08:06.251 --> 08:09.519
a gerbil, two
turtles and a horse.

08:09.521 --> 08:10.886
A horse?

08:10.888 --> 08:12.422
That was a joke, the horse.

08:12.424 --> 08:14.260
I didn't kill a horse.

08:15.292 --> 08:17.994
But my record as a care
provider is less than stellar

08:17.996 --> 08:21.531
so here's to a
lifetime of adventures.

08:21.533 --> 08:23.233
Just the two of us.

08:23.235 --> 08:24.600
Cheers!

08:24.602 --> 08:25.437
Cheers!

08:31.910 --> 08:33.544
Can I help you, sir?

08:35.145 --> 08:37.046
I think I need a drink.

08:37.048 --> 08:38.183
What'll it be?

08:39.582 --> 08:43.620
Something sweet with bubbles
and a splash of grenadine.

08:43.621 --> 08:45.187
Sounds serious.

08:45.189 --> 08:47.356
It's very serious.

08:47.358 --> 08:49.057
Do you wanna talk about it?

08:49.059 --> 08:51.326
It's family stuff.

08:51.328 --> 08:52.397
Here ya go.

09:03.375 --> 09:04.673
Thanks.

09:04.675 --> 09:06.542
It's okay.

09:06.544 --> 09:07.442
It's on the house.

09:07.444 --> 09:09.077
Thanks.

09:09.079 --> 09:11.214
Do you know where
the Pearson party is?

09:11.216 --> 09:12.447
Yeah, it's down the hall,

09:12.449 --> 09:15.220
first set of double
doors on the left.

09:16.655 --> 09:18.089
Wish me luck.

09:19.491 --> 09:20.492
Good luck.

09:21.693 --> 09:24.994
Okay, I will
start the ceremony

09:24.996 --> 09:27.429
with a little introduction like,

09:27.431 --> 09:29.365
dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today

09:29.367 --> 09:34.202
in the presence of God to
join Nicholas Buchanan Pearson

09:34.204 --> 09:35.138
That's me.

09:35.140 --> 09:37.673
and Sydney Dell Bartlett
in holy matrimony.

09:37.675 --> 09:39.374
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

09:39.376 --> 09:43.078
Di da di da, et cetera,
et cetera, et cetera.

09:43.080 --> 09:45.682
And then I'm required
by the collar to ask

09:45.684 --> 09:49.519
be there anyone here today
who knows of any reason

09:49.521 --> 09:53.623
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony?

09:53.625 --> 09:57.897
Speak now or forever
hold your peace.

09:58.630 --> 09:59.631
Excuse me.

10:01.165 --> 10:02.664
Can I help you, young man?

10:02.666 --> 10:03.666
I do.

10:03.668 --> 10:05.033
You do what?

10:06.972 --> 10:07.703
Well, I mean, this seemed like

10:07.705 --> 10:09.572
the perfect moment to say it

10:09.574 --> 10:12.475
since you asked the
question, right?

10:12.477 --> 10:13.408
What's goin' on, buddy?

10:13.410 --> 10:16.012
What are you talkin' about?

10:16.014 --> 10:17.583
You're my father.

10:19.550 --> 10:22.085
It was just one night.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.119
Not you, sir.

10:23.121 --> 10:24.957
No, him.

10:26.690 --> 10:28.390
He's my father.

10:28.392 --> 10:30.360
I'm your dad?

10:30.362 --> 10:33.062
Yes, you're my father.

10:33.064 --> 10:34.934
Who is this, Nick?

10:36.001 --> 10:37.133
Who is this?

10:37.135 --> 10:38.134
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

10:38.136 --> 10:41.004
Very funny, hilarious!

10:41.006 --> 10:44.773
Whose inappropriate little
caper is this, Larry?

10:44.775 --> 10:45.741
Brian, you do this?

10:45.743 --> 10:47.342
No.

10:47.344 --> 10:48.344
Simon?

10:48.346 --> 10:49.578
- No.
- Not me.

10:49.580 --> 10:51.179
Was it any of
these guys 'cause...

10:51.181 --> 10:53.682
I don't know who
these people are.

10:53.684 --> 10:55.751
Ooh, is that cake?

10:55.753 --> 10:57.253
I love cake.

10:57.255 --> 10:59.054
All right, son.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.523
You've had your little joke.

11:01.525 --> 11:03.359
Now just move along.

11:03.361 --> 11:05.394
It's not a joke, ma'am.

11:05.396 --> 11:06.696
He's my dad.

11:06.698 --> 11:09.499
All right, well,
in typical fashion,

11:09.501 --> 11:11.701
my ingenious friends
at The Jonathan Club

11:11.703 --> 11:14.537
just don't know when
to end the sketch.

11:14.539 --> 11:15.738
I'm just gonna take a moment

11:15.740 --> 11:19.542
to tip this little thespian
for his stirring performance

11:19.544 --> 11:23.314
and I'll be back before
you finish your cake.

11:24.681 --> 11:27.182
All right, I'm afraid I'm
unaware of the protocols

11:27.184 --> 11:29.818
when it comes to gratuities
for embarrassment

11:29.820 --> 11:31.155
so bear with me.

11:32.424 --> 11:34.190
50 gonna do it?

11:34.192 --> 11:35.224
What are you talking about?

11:35.226 --> 11:36.392
I am talking about your tip.

11:36.394 --> 11:37.726
Just take it and
tell whoever sent you

11:37.728 --> 11:39.662
that you did an
absolutely smashing job

11:39.664 --> 11:41.197
of disrupting my evening.

11:41.199 --> 11:42.465
I don't want your money.

11:42.467 --> 11:43.432
Look, kid, take it.

11:43.434 --> 11:45.067
I'm not usually this generous.

11:45.069 --> 11:48.203
Listen, I need
you to find my mom.

11:48.205 --> 11:49.471
Buddy, I don't know you

11:49.473 --> 11:50.673
so I wouldn't know
who your mother is.

11:50.675 --> 11:53.809
Well, you must have known
her, at least a little bit.

11:53.811 --> 11:54.644
Why?

11:54.646 --> 11:55.677
Because you're my dad.

11:55.679 --> 11:56.578
Look, stop saying that.

11:56.580 --> 11:57.312
I'm not your dad.

11:57.314 --> 11:57.980
- But you are.
- No, I'm not.

11:57.982 --> 11:58.847
- Yes, you are.
- I'm not!

11:58.849 --> 12:00.649
- Yes, you are!
- Stop contradicting me.

12:00.651 --> 12:01.451
See?

12:01.453 --> 12:02.284
You sound like a father.

12:02.286 --> 12:03.251
I do not.

12:03.253 --> 12:03.852
- Yes, you do.
- I do not.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.120
But really, you do.

12:05.122 --> 12:06.721
Look, this is ridiculous.

12:06.723 --> 12:08.124
No, thank you, we're all set.

12:08.126 --> 12:08.857
What does he want?

12:08.859 --> 12:09.792
He wants to give us a towel.

12:09.794 --> 12:10.625
Why?

12:10.627 --> 12:11.860
'Cause it's his job.

12:11.862 --> 12:12.562
Well, why don't you take a
towel and let him do his job?

12:12.564 --> 12:13.361
'Cause I don't want a towel!

12:13.363 --> 12:14.163
I wanna get rid of
you and get back

12:14.165 --> 12:15.798
- to my wedding rehearsal.
- Thanks.

12:15.800 --> 12:17.166
Can I keep this?

12:17.168 --> 12:17.866
No, yes, whatever,
I don't care.

12:17.868 --> 12:19.268
I don't care at all.

12:19.270 --> 12:20.870
Just take the money,
kid, and get outta here.

12:20.872 --> 12:22.404
Nick?

12:22.406 --> 12:24.273
What's going on?

12:24.275 --> 12:25.107
Is she supposed to be in here?

12:25.109 --> 12:26.308
No.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.243
Don't worry, Syd,
I'm handling it.

12:27.245 --> 12:28.711
Everyone's waiting for you.

12:28.713 --> 12:29.846
Did you know this man
gives free towels to people?

12:29.848 --> 12:31.880
Oh, hi, thank you.

12:31.882 --> 12:33.648
Nick, do you have a...?

12:33.650 --> 12:34.749
Yes, here, thank you so much.

12:34.751 --> 12:36.751
- Gotta go, coming through.
- That's for the towels.

12:36.753 --> 12:39.221
Look, Syd, I'll be
right there, okay?

12:39.223 --> 12:40.456
I'm just wrapping things up

12:40.458 --> 12:41.657
with our wonderful
performer there.

12:41.659 --> 12:42.825
Okay, please hurry.

12:42.827 --> 12:43.893
Yeah, two minutes, love.

12:43.895 --> 12:44.730
I promise.

12:47.131 --> 12:48.663
So what's the plan, Dad?

12:48.665 --> 12:49.499
Stop calling me
that, all right?

12:49.501 --> 12:50.600
I'm not your dad.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.869
Where'd you get that stupid
idea from anyway, huh?

12:52.871 --> 12:54.637
From him.

12:54.639 --> 12:55.741
How do you do?

12:57.842 --> 13:00.375
I am The Amazing Fabular.

13:00.377 --> 13:02.144
What is that, a service rat?

13:02.146 --> 13:03.812
Mr. Sparkles is a dog.

13:03.814 --> 13:05.447
He is my portal to
other dimensions

13:05.449 --> 13:06.749
of sight and sound
that provide me

13:06.751 --> 13:09.284
with the gift of clairvoyance.

13:09.286 --> 13:11.921
Oh, you're a fortune teller?

13:12.756 --> 13:15.557
I am a world-class
psychic, sir.

13:15.559 --> 13:17.426
I have clients among persons

13:17.428 --> 13:19.828
of the most well-known
celebrity and high society.

13:19.830 --> 13:22.831
Yeah, and here you
are in the men's room.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.866
Hmm, as unaccustomed as I am

13:24.868 --> 13:26.701
to having to avouch
my credentials

13:26.703 --> 13:28.504
within earshot of
a public commode,

13:28.506 --> 13:30.907
I can tell you that unequivocally,
this boy tells the truth.

13:30.909 --> 13:32.508
You are his father.

13:32.510 --> 13:33.341
Oh, yeah?

13:33.343 --> 13:35.811
What makes you so sure?

13:35.813 --> 13:38.313
Mr. Sparkles told me.

13:40.184 --> 13:42.618
Oh, excuse me, let
me get this straight.

13:42.620 --> 13:44.486
You want me to believe
that this man-child here

13:44.488 --> 13:45.855
is the fruit of my loins

13:45.857 --> 13:49.392
because you received
a cosmic message

13:49.394 --> 13:50.625
through the strange
little rodent

13:50.627 --> 13:51.726
that's tucked in your armpit?

13:51.728 --> 13:52.727
Is that it?

13:52.729 --> 13:54.429
Precisely, ruff!

13:54.431 --> 13:55.965
Excuse me, I'm due
back on planet Earth.

13:55.967 --> 14:00.769
Uh-uh, perhaps, these DNA
results will convince you.

14:00.771 --> 14:01.672
DNA what?

14:08.846 --> 14:10.712
Nicholas, Nicholas!

14:10.714 --> 14:13.749
What is this crap about
me gettin' cut off, huh?

14:13.751 --> 14:15.585
It's humiliating.

14:15.587 --> 14:17.852
Nicholas, what
has gotten into you?

14:17.854 --> 14:19.688
I mean, what in the
world is going on?

14:19.690 --> 14:21.490
I am very disappointed in you.

14:21.492 --> 14:22.658
Tell Syd

14:22.660 --> 14:23.525
- that I will be right in.
- And by the way,

14:23.527 --> 14:25.794
who the, is that kid?

14:25.796 --> 14:27.395
- I will be right back.
- Money into this...

14:27.397 --> 14:28.397
Take the reverend with you.

14:28.399 --> 14:30.869
Get him a drink,
get me one, too.

14:32.536 --> 14:34.971
All right, I don't know
what to make of this.

14:34.973 --> 14:38.874
And you've kind of caught me
at an awkward moment so just

14:38.876 --> 14:40.909
meet me at this address
at 11 p.m. tonight.

14:40.911 --> 14:42.278
Can you do that?

14:42.280 --> 14:43.312
Sure.

14:43.314 --> 14:44.779
All right.

14:44.781 --> 14:46.014
Why don't you take that towel
and get rid of that thing

14:46.016 --> 14:48.753
that's hanging from
your nostril, kid?

14:50.454 --> 14:51.622
Thanks, Dad.

14:53.891 --> 14:55.394
See you tonight.

14:57.261 --> 14:58.927
I see good things
in your future.

14:58.929 --> 15:00.929
Bye, Mom, bye, Dad.

15:00.931 --> 15:03.666
- Goodbye, cake eater.
- I love you so, so much.

15:03.668 --> 15:04.966
Thank you for everything.

15:04.968 --> 15:06.001
I'll see you Sunday

15:06.003 --> 15:07.370
- at the wedding.
- Love you, honey.

15:07.372 --> 15:09.304
- I love you, Dad.
- Bye, dear.

15:09.306 --> 15:10.605
Oh, bye, bye, guys.

15:10.607 --> 15:11.440
Hey.

15:11.442 --> 15:12.374
Sorry.

15:12.376 --> 15:13.408
What was that all about?

15:13.410 --> 15:14.342
What?

15:14.344 --> 15:15.977
The whole kid prank thing?

15:15.979 --> 15:17.013
Who would do that?

15:17.015 --> 15:17.913
That's not cool.

15:17.915 --> 15:19.548
I know, it was so
tasteless, right?

15:19.550 --> 15:21.049
And that kid wouldn't
tell me who hired him.

15:21.051 --> 15:23.318
He must have been
paid a lot of money.

15:23.320 --> 15:23.952
He's a good actor.

15:23.954 --> 15:25.388
Yeah.

15:25.390 --> 15:27.322
Anyway, it's an
awkward memory now.

15:27.324 --> 15:29.357
Hey, this book publicity
has just got me exhausted.

15:29.359 --> 15:30.993
My bed is calling me.

15:30.995 --> 15:32.628
Oh, yeah, honey, I understand.

15:32.630 --> 15:33.663
Why don't you go get some sleep?

15:33.665 --> 15:34.596
- Okay.
- I'm gonna stay

15:34.598 --> 15:36.065
and have a drink with Kelly.

15:36.067 --> 15:37.966
I'm gonna drink,
she's gonna eat cake.

15:37.968 --> 15:39.302
Okay.

15:39.304 --> 15:40.302
Hey, Syd?

15:40.304 --> 15:40.936
Yes?

15:40.938 --> 15:42.304
I love you.

15:42.306 --> 15:43.639
You'd better, there's
no going back now.

15:43.641 --> 15:44.874
But I will see you tomorrow.

15:44.876 --> 15:46.008
We've gotta go over
music for the band

15:46.010 --> 15:47.777
and seating arrangements.

15:47.779 --> 15:48.677
Can't wait.

15:48.679 --> 15:50.046
Mwah, 10:15!

15:50.048 --> 15:50.913
With bells on!

15:50.915 --> 15:51.750
Okay.

15:55.053 --> 15:56.085
He seems in a hurry.

15:56.087 --> 15:57.720
He's
dead tired, Kelly.

15:57.722 --> 15:58.921
Uh-huh.

15:58.923 --> 16:00.089
What's
that supposed to mean?

16:00.091 --> 16:02.557
Uh-huh, from the Latin.

16:02.559 --> 16:04.360
Uh meaning he's acting fishy,

16:04.362 --> 16:06.328
and huh meaning he's
up to something.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.029
Okay, spare me your
paranoid fantasies.

16:08.031 --> 16:10.466
I know you don't like Nick
but you gotta get used to him.

16:10.468 --> 16:12.067
As of Sunday, he's family.

16:12.069 --> 16:13.668
I like him fine.

16:13.670 --> 16:16.004
He's just, you
know, he's a little,

16:16.006 --> 16:17.673
a little too perfect.

16:17.675 --> 16:18.974
You talking about in bed?

16:18.976 --> 16:20.011
What?

16:21.612 --> 16:25.581
- Don't hit my belly!
- I didn't mean to!

16:25.583 --> 16:26.548
Can I have your wine?

16:26.550 --> 16:27.383
No, you can't have wine.

16:27.385 --> 16:28.017
Can I have a sip?

16:28.019 --> 16:29.788
No wine, no sips.

16:35.760 --> 16:36.926
First of all,
absolutely no one

16:36.928 --> 16:38.594
can know about this meeting.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.096
Is that clear?

16:40.098 --> 16:41.663
Perhaps we should talk in code

16:41.665 --> 16:43.065
in case your house
has been bugged

16:43.067 --> 16:45.033
by the secret paternity police?

16:45.035 --> 16:47.036
I'm so glad you're
amused by this.

16:47.038 --> 16:48.604
You have no idea what
this could do to me.

16:48.606 --> 16:49.941
Oh, yes, I do.

16:50.942 --> 16:52.174
Scandal!

16:52.176 --> 16:55.043
Man who makes fun of people
who have children for a living

16:55.045 --> 16:57.145
doesn't know he
has one of his own.

16:57.147 --> 16:58.547
Tabloids love that
kind of stuff.

16:58.549 --> 17:00.482
It's not just that.

17:00.484 --> 17:01.116
It's Sydney.

17:01.118 --> 17:02.784
Who's he?

17:02.786 --> 17:05.520
She is my fiancee and we're
getting married on Sunday.

17:05.521 --> 17:06.489
What's wrong?

17:06.491 --> 17:08.457
You don't think she'll like me?

17:08.459 --> 17:11.160
Well, children aren't
part of our plan.

17:11.162 --> 17:13.560
Well, you should have made
that plan before you made me.

17:13.563 --> 17:15.698
Preach the gospel.

17:15.700 --> 17:17.799
That's insane.

17:17.800 --> 17:21.036
How do I even know
that this is my DNA?

17:21.038 --> 17:23.605
Well, about six months ago,

17:23.607 --> 17:25.641
I was listening to
Fabular's radio show.

17:25.643 --> 17:27.710
Saturday mornings,
we have The Amazing Fabular.

17:27.712 --> 17:29.979
Which I really like to
listen to every Saturday.

17:29.981 --> 17:32.615
I like the extra sensory
perception and stuff.

17:32.617 --> 17:36.519
And all of a sudden, The
Amazing Fabular says...

17:36.521 --> 17:37.356
Mason?

17:38.522 --> 17:40.692
I know who your father is.

17:41.858 --> 17:44.993
So of course I'm
like, wait a second.

17:44.995 --> 17:49.164
My name is Mason so maybe I'm
the Mason he's talking about.

17:49.166 --> 17:52.601
So I call up the show and
Fabular tells me it's me

17:52.603 --> 17:56.971
and that my dad's a famous
writer named Nick Pearson.

17:56.973 --> 17:57.975
That's you.

17:59.109 --> 18:00.875
Yes, I know that that's me.

18:00.877 --> 18:02.111
I mean, what are the odds?

18:02.113 --> 18:05.114
Crazy ones, if you think about
it because when I was born,

18:05.116 --> 18:07.082
Mason was a super popular name,

18:07.084 --> 18:10.085
so there are like
a kajillion Masons.

18:10.087 --> 18:11.453
Sure, okay.

18:11.455 --> 18:12.821
So then I went on the internet

18:12.823 --> 18:14.656
and I Googled Nick Pearson.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.759
And a lot of stuff came up
about how you write books,

18:16.761 --> 18:18.861
about how you hate
kids and little dogs.

18:18.863 --> 18:20.195
Yeah, and I hate psychics.

18:20.197 --> 18:22.163
Where are your manners?

18:22.165 --> 18:24.165
Go on, come on.

18:24.167 --> 18:26.134
Get to the DNA bit.

18:26.136 --> 18:28.938
Right, well, I needed
some part of your body.

18:28.940 --> 18:30.940
So I went on eBay
and I found somebody

18:30.942 --> 18:32.540
selling a lock of your hair.

18:32.542 --> 18:33.642
What?

18:33.644 --> 18:35.243
Yeah, it's your barber.

18:35.245 --> 18:37.078
He collects the hair
of his famous clients

18:37.080 --> 18:38.849
and sells it on eBay.

18:40.251 --> 18:42.151
That could be anybody's hair.

18:42.153 --> 18:44.619
Is your barber named
Nino Spaghettios?

18:44.621 --> 18:46.255
Nino Spanetti.

18:46.257 --> 18:48.156
Oh, my god.

18:48.158 --> 18:51.527
So then I bid on
the auction and I won.

18:51.529 --> 18:55.196
Then I found a place on the
internet that does DNA testing.

18:55.198 --> 19:00.204
So I cut off a piece of my
hair and sent in those samples.

19:03.007 --> 19:05.143
A few weeks later,
the results came back.

19:07.244 --> 19:09.044
It was a match!

19:09.046 --> 19:10.011
Yes!

19:10.013 --> 19:10.848
Yes, yes!

19:11.915 --> 19:14.215
So then I called The
Amazing Fabular to tell him

19:14.217 --> 19:16.050
and he said he wanted
see the look on your face

19:16.052 --> 19:17.553
when I told you.

19:17.555 --> 19:20.559
There's nothing
like live theater.

19:24.861 --> 19:27.162
I know what I'm gonna
title my next book.

19:27.164 --> 19:31.232
I Hate the Internet
and Hairstylists.

19:31.234 --> 19:33.237
Don't forget psychics.

19:35.071 --> 19:36.073
All right.

19:37.541 --> 19:39.008
What do you want, kid?

19:39.010 --> 19:40.542
I just wanna find my mom.

19:40.544 --> 19:41.479
Your mom?

19:42.646 --> 19:44.779
Who's been taking care
of you all these years?

19:44.781 --> 19:46.949
I have a foster mother.

19:46.951 --> 19:48.584
Annie Gordon.

19:48.586 --> 19:50.219
This is really good, Annie.

19:50.221 --> 19:52.988
But she's getting really old.

19:52.990 --> 19:54.925
And she has narcolepsy.

19:57.194 --> 19:58.093
Annie?

19:58.095 --> 19:59.929
She can't take care
of herself anymore

19:59.931 --> 20:02.964
so she's being moved into a home

20:02.966 --> 20:06.035
which means I'll end
up back in foster care.

20:06.037 --> 20:09.971
That's why she let me come here
with Fabular to find my mom.

20:09.973 --> 20:13.909
A wise, wise woman, with
an acute sense of character.

20:13.911 --> 20:16.778
I imagine she wouldn't
like you very much.

20:16.780 --> 20:19.114
Look, I know you
don't want me, Nick

20:19.116 --> 20:20.782
because you're famous
for hating kids and all.

20:20.784 --> 20:24.255
No, I don't exactly hate kids.

20:24.955 --> 20:28.792
You're the only one
who knows who my mom is.

20:32.863 --> 20:34.866
Okay, how old are you?

20:35.832 --> 20:36.634
13.

20:37.635 --> 20:38.837
13 plus nine.

20:40.704 --> 20:43.875
Where was I 14 years ago?

20:46.344 --> 20:48.076
Oh, my god.

20:48.078 --> 20:51.279
All right, this is gonna be
more difficult than I thought.

20:51.281 --> 20:56.117
Let's say I was acquainted
with a lotta different ladies

20:56.119 --> 20:57.685
at that time of my life.

20:57.687 --> 20:58.753
How quaint.

20:58.755 --> 20:59.954
And that's the other issue.

20:59.956 --> 21:03.692
I don't want my fiancee or
my in-laws to know about this

21:03.694 --> 21:05.827
bountiful romantic
history of mine.

21:05.829 --> 21:07.762
You have such
a way with words.

21:07.764 --> 21:09.932
You really should be
writing cards for Hallmark.

21:09.934 --> 21:11.666
Hey, if you're
such a good psychic,

21:11.668 --> 21:14.369
how come you can't
see who his mother is?

21:14.371 --> 21:16.404
Because this journey was meant

21:16.406 --> 21:17.839
for the both of you
to take together.

21:17.841 --> 21:19.307
Isn't that right, Mr. Sparkles?

21:22.379 --> 21:23.581
All right.

21:26.117 --> 21:29.852
Despite the chorus
of voices in my head

21:29.854 --> 21:31.086
that are screaming like banshees

21:31.088 --> 21:34.259
to run like hell
from you two weirdos,

21:36.059 --> 21:37.358
I'll help you.

21:37.360 --> 21:38.460
Really?

21:38.462 --> 21:43.265
But the deal is I will
give you two days of my time

21:43.267 --> 21:46.367
and if we don't discover
who your mom is by then,

21:46.369 --> 21:47.303
you move on, I move on

21:47.305 --> 21:49.070
and we close this
chapter of our lives.

21:49.072 --> 21:50.138
Is that clear?

21:50.140 --> 21:50.941
Deal.

21:55.745 --> 21:57.445
All right, meet me back
here tomorrow morning.

21:57.447 --> 22:00.048
I'll research the possibilities.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.416
And with any luck, I'll wake up

22:01.418 --> 22:05.319
and this will be a
bourbon-induced nightmare.

22:05.321 --> 22:06.788
Let us take leave
of this Lothario

22:06.790 --> 22:08.723
and investigate the
many places this man

22:08.725 --> 22:10.895
may have planted his seed.

22:12.096 --> 22:14.098
We'll see ourselves out.

22:14.999 --> 22:16.832
Night, Dad.

22:16.834 --> 22:18.901
Good night, kid.

22:18.903 --> 22:19.971
It's Mason.

22:20.870 --> 22:22.339
Good night, Mason.

22:40.724 --> 22:41.824
Thank you.

22:41.826 --> 22:43.092
Thanks, come again.

22:45.396 --> 22:47.028
Hey, sweetheart,
where are you?

22:47.030 --> 22:47.930
Don't say late.

22:47.932 --> 22:48.797
Where is he?

22:50.267 --> 22:53.268
Hey, look, Syd, a
little situation came up.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.435
A situation?

22:54.437 --> 22:55.804
Oh, really?

22:55.806 --> 22:57.105
I said, shush!

22:57.107 --> 22:58.073
What'd you say?

22:58.075 --> 22:58.906
Not you, hon.

22:58.908 --> 23:00.409
What's going on?

23:00.411 --> 23:03.112
Oh, well, so I got a call
from Albert this morning.

23:03.114 --> 23:06.381
It turns out one of their
college circuit lecturers

23:06.383 --> 23:07.782
dropped out.

23:07.784 --> 23:10.486
I gotta pop up to Santa
Barbara and fill in.

23:10.488 --> 23:12.121
And you agreed?

23:12.123 --> 23:13.489
You've gotta be
kidding me, Nick!

23:13.491 --> 23:14.789
What is it?

23:14.791 --> 23:16.025
- What is he doing?
- Stop!

23:16.027 --> 23:18.227
I know that the timing is
inconvenient but it's Albert.

23:18.229 --> 23:19.461
It's not like I
can say no to him.

23:19.463 --> 23:20.796
He's my publisher, babe.

23:20.798 --> 23:22.364
A little inconvenient?

23:22.366 --> 23:24.432
The wedding is this Sunday!

23:24.434 --> 23:26.067
I mean, can't they
find somebody else?

23:26.069 --> 23:28.403
Maybe somebody who
isn't about to celebrate

23:28.405 --> 23:30.905
the most important day
of their entire life?

23:30.907 --> 23:32.540
I'll only be gone a day.

23:32.542 --> 23:33.374
Maybe two.

23:33.376 --> 23:34.308
Two?

23:34.310 --> 23:36.244
I don't know what to say.

23:36.246 --> 23:37.479
I'll be back
before you know it.

23:37.481 --> 23:39.181
Besides, don't they
say it's bad luck

23:39.183 --> 23:41.450
for the groom to see the
bride before the wedding?

23:41.452 --> 23:44.086
But they don't mean
the whole weekend!

23:44.088 --> 23:46.855
And I love how understanding
you're being, honey.

23:46.857 --> 23:49.258
No, I'm actually not
being understanding.

23:49.260 --> 23:52.161
This is not the sound of
someone being understanding.

23:52.163 --> 23:53.561
Oh, my gosh.

23:53.563 --> 23:55.263
Okay, so now you
suddenly have to disappear

23:55.265 --> 23:57.065
for a few days right
before your own wedding?

23:57.067 --> 23:58.432
That sounds pretty
suspicious to me, Nick.

23:58.434 --> 24:00.501
Hey, Kelly, my
favorite sister.

24:00.503 --> 24:02.471
In-law.

24:02.473 --> 24:04.138
All right, look,
I gotta get going

24:04.140 --> 24:07.111
so tell Syd I'll ring her
when I get there, bye.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.815
I'm telling you,
he's up to something.

24:12.817 --> 24:14.549
Maybe it is something good.

24:14.551 --> 24:16.951
Did you ever think of that?

24:16.953 --> 24:21.056
No, Sydney, there is
something he's not telling you.

24:21.058 --> 24:22.223
And I think it has
something to do

24:22.225 --> 24:24.058
with that kid from last night.

24:24.060 --> 24:26.461
Nick just explained
the situation

24:26.463 --> 24:28.262
and I have no reason
not to trust him.

24:28.264 --> 24:30.164
I'm just saying.

24:30.166 --> 24:31.336
I have to pee.

24:32.936 --> 24:34.603
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

24:34.605 --> 24:35.837
The baby's kicking!

24:35.839 --> 24:36.471
You wanna feel it?

24:36.473 --> 24:37.940
No, I'm okay.

24:37.942 --> 24:39.141
No, no, come on,
feel it, feel it.

24:39.143 --> 24:40.075
No, I actually
don't wanna feel it.

24:40.077 --> 24:41.076
Just feel it for a second.

24:41.078 --> 24:41.676
- Just for a second.
- Actually, I don't really

24:41.678 --> 24:42.377
- want to.
- No, come here.

24:42.379 --> 24:45.513
Say hello to your Aunt Sydney!

24:45.515 --> 24:47.449
Ooh, it's just so weird!

24:47.451 --> 24:48.851
It's so strange!

24:48.853 --> 24:51.053
Why can't human
beings just lay eggs

24:51.055 --> 24:53.888
like more sensible species
of the animal kingdom?

24:53.890 --> 24:55.590
Like peacocks and platypuses.

24:55.592 --> 24:57.896
It's just so much easier.

25:06.036 --> 25:07.869
Ow!

25:10.241 --> 25:11.573
Whoa, what the?

25:11.575 --> 25:12.477
Surprise.

25:13.877 --> 25:14.777
How'd you get in here?

25:14.779 --> 25:16.411
You said to come
back in the morning.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.547
The door was unlocked.

25:18.549 --> 25:20.615
What are you doing
to my furniture?

25:20.617 --> 25:22.550
The feng shui was off.

25:22.552 --> 25:24.486
It simply had to be done.

25:24.488 --> 25:26.488
Fabular needs room
to have a clean aura

25:26.490 --> 25:27.890
to receive messages.

25:27.892 --> 25:29.391
Yeah?

25:29.393 --> 25:31.526
Is he receiving the message
I'm sending him right now?

25:31.528 --> 25:32.961
Do you loofah?

25:32.963 --> 25:33.929
Do I what?

25:33.931 --> 25:35.463
Loofah, I mean, do you loofah?

25:35.465 --> 25:36.298
I don't loofah.

25:36.300 --> 25:37.598
You should loofah.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.268
I don't wanna loofah.

25:39.270 --> 25:40.903
It removes the dead cells

25:40.905 --> 25:45.274
and helps add a delightful
luster to your skin.

25:45.276 --> 25:47.375
I got a book on the New
York Times Best Seller list.

25:47.377 --> 25:49.146
I don't need a
delightful luster.

25:56.319 --> 25:59.957
Your rat took a
dump on my carpet.

26:01.457 --> 26:03.624
Oh, Mr. Sparkles!

26:03.626 --> 26:07.098
Why didn't you tell me you
needed to make a stinky?

26:08.933 --> 26:11.133
Santa Barbara, huh?

26:11.135 --> 26:13.134
Ooh, maybe you should pop
by for a surprise visit.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.670
Ha, ha, that's funny

26:14.672 --> 26:16.672
but we still have to hit the
bridal shop and nail salon.

26:16.674 --> 26:18.406
Okay, I was just saying, I
thought it'd be a nice gesture.

26:18.408 --> 26:20.509
That would be a sneaky
and suspicious gesture.

26:20.511 --> 26:21.676
Only if he's actually there.

26:21.678 --> 26:22.544
Of course he's there!

26:22.546 --> 26:23.679
Just stop it, Kelly.

26:23.681 --> 26:25.579
There's no way you're
getting into my head on this.

26:25.581 --> 26:26.647
I'm pretty sure I will.

26:26.649 --> 26:28.652
Just drink your juice.

26:31.454 --> 26:32.653
Last night, I sorted
through all these letters

26:32.655 --> 26:36.191
and address books and I came
up with a few possibilities.

26:36.193 --> 26:39.030
Mmm, I'm sensing
something here.

26:40.297 --> 26:41.696
Oh, I'm so glad you're here

26:41.698 --> 26:44.066
to substantiate all my research.

26:44.068 --> 26:46.367
I'm getting an A.

26:46.369 --> 26:48.069
A really big A.

26:48.071 --> 26:49.971
Well, that makes two of us.

26:49.973 --> 26:51.640
Such darkness!

26:51.642 --> 26:54.108
Well, I'm filled with darkness
before my morning coffee.

26:54.110 --> 26:55.344
You can make fun
of me all you wish

26:55.346 --> 26:56.979
but I'm still the one
who identified you

26:56.981 --> 26:57.680
as the boy's father.

26:57.682 --> 26:59.647
Yep, you keep telling me that.

26:59.649 --> 27:00.682
But I'm the one who
had to figure out

27:00.684 --> 27:03.352
which of three Christines
might be his mother.

27:03.354 --> 27:04.685
Three Christine's?

27:04.687 --> 27:05.721
Yeah, three Christine's,
two Jennifer's,

27:05.723 --> 27:07.288
two Barbara's, four Patty's...

27:07.290 --> 27:09.758
♪ And a partridge
in a pear tree ♪

27:09.760 --> 27:12.259
Please don't sing ever again.

27:12.261 --> 27:14.462
All right, the point is anyway
that I managed to pinpoint

27:14.464 --> 27:16.565
the ones who mathematically
fit the chronology.

27:16.567 --> 27:19.233
And none of them begin with A.

27:19.235 --> 27:22.403
So then, how do we figure
out which one's my mother?

27:22.405 --> 27:23.739
We're gonna take a
little road trip.

27:23.741 --> 27:25.374
I contacted the ladies,
they know we're coming,

27:25.376 --> 27:27.041
they just don't know why yet.

27:27.043 --> 27:28.676
Why wouldn't
you just ask them?

27:28.678 --> 27:29.744
Because I think
something as delicate

27:29.746 --> 27:31.480
as one's potential maternity

27:31.482 --> 27:33.714
is probably best
discussed face to face.

27:33.716 --> 27:34.649
Got ya.

27:34.651 --> 27:35.784
All right, let's get goin'.

27:35.786 --> 27:36.617
We have a large amount of people

27:36.619 --> 27:38.353
to cover in a small
amount of time.

27:38.355 --> 27:40.321
Not unlike your
illustrious past.

27:40.323 --> 27:41.623
Does he really need to come?

27:41.625 --> 27:42.259
Definitely.

27:43.126 --> 27:44.492
Let it be known that I require

27:44.494 --> 27:46.528
this safari of
yours to end early

27:46.530 --> 27:49.463
as I'm supposed to be at the
Holiday Inn Burbank on Friday

27:49.465 --> 27:51.700
to deliver a keynote speech
to a symposium of my peers.

27:51.702 --> 27:53.434
And my peers tend to be snippy.

27:53.436 --> 27:55.202
If we're not done by then,
I'll have a lot more to answer

27:55.204 --> 27:57.405
to than a bunch of
phony soothsayers.

27:57.407 --> 27:59.708
Guys, this car
only has two seats.

27:59.710 --> 28:00.712
Right.

28:01.678 --> 28:03.478
I guess we'll have
to take the Fab-Mobile.

28:03.480 --> 28:04.712
The Fab-Mobile?

28:04.714 --> 28:06.149
The Fab-Mobile.

28:08.719 --> 28:09.754
Perfect.

28:10.820 --> 28:15.222
So, what's the name of
this first member of your

28:15.224 --> 28:17.462
countless sexual conquests?

28:18.361 --> 28:20.394
Carla Intintoli.

28:20.396 --> 28:22.230
I like the name Carla.

28:22.232 --> 28:23.734
Carla Intintoli.

28:24.768 --> 28:26.134
She is from Italy.

28:26.136 --> 28:28.737
No, her dad's Brazilian.

28:28.739 --> 28:29.640
Yes, he is.

28:30.773 --> 28:33.708
He was a farmer and
he used his hand

28:33.710 --> 28:34.776
to make money for the family.

28:34.778 --> 28:36.144
What are you doing?

28:36.146 --> 28:37.078
Are you doing psychic
stuff right now?

28:37.080 --> 28:38.145
Don't do that right now, okay?

28:38.147 --> 28:39.713
I can't help my blessings.

28:39.715 --> 28:41.516
They just come to me, Nick.

28:41.518 --> 28:42.750
Really?

28:42.752 --> 28:44.385
I thought Mr. Sparkles
here was the gifted one.

28:44.387 --> 28:46.755
Well, it goes to
Sparkles, then to Fabular.

28:46.757 --> 28:48.459
All right, okay.

28:49.358 --> 28:50.791
Just don't say anything

28:50.793 --> 28:53.761
'cause I don't wanna
freak Carla out.

28:53.763 --> 28:55.665
It'll be my pleasure.

28:57.166 --> 28:59.101
You think she'll remember you?

28:59.103 --> 29:00.705
They never forget.

29:07.176 --> 29:08.777
Nick?

29:08.779 --> 29:10.345
Hi, Carla.

29:10.347 --> 29:11.779
Is that really you?

29:11.781 --> 29:12.817
It's me.

29:14.617 --> 29:15.453
Wow.

29:16.453 --> 29:19.753
I never thought I'd have
this opportunity again.

29:19.755 --> 29:21.490
Opportunity?

29:26.864 --> 29:28.864
I think it's great
that she remembers you.

29:28.866 --> 29:31.465
Why was she so mad?

29:31.467 --> 29:34.336
Well, Mason, when
relationships end,

29:34.338 --> 29:36.704
people get emotional
because they gotta justify

29:36.706 --> 29:38.839
why they were with that
person in the first place

29:38.841 --> 29:41.876
which can manifest itself
in bitterness, resentment,

29:41.878 --> 29:43.481
hatred or violence.

29:45.148 --> 29:48.549
Okay, we have a triple patty
burger with fries, well done

29:48.551 --> 29:51.586
and a strawberry shake
with extra cherries.

29:51.588 --> 29:53.922
One small dinner salad,
hold the croutons

29:53.924 --> 29:58.792
add extra garbanzo beans
and dressing on the side.

29:58.794 --> 30:01.829
And one frozen bag of peas.

30:01.831 --> 30:02.833
Thank you.

30:04.835 --> 30:06.401
I have to pee.

30:06.403 --> 30:07.805
I'll be right back.

30:09.373 --> 30:11.640
Why do I get the feeling
that every woman you ever dated

30:11.642 --> 30:13.407
has a bone to pick with you?

30:13.409 --> 30:16.813
I bet you racked up
quite the bag of karma.

30:17.947 --> 30:20.347
Why don't you stop your
yammering and tell me the truth?

30:20.349 --> 30:21.482
I beg your pardon?

30:21.484 --> 30:22.750
What's really goin' on here?

30:22.752 --> 30:24.853
How much money are
they giving you?

30:24.855 --> 30:26.288
Or are you looking to fleece

30:26.290 --> 30:29.557
this kid's foster mom
out of her life savings?

30:29.559 --> 30:30.825
How dare you.

30:30.827 --> 30:32.560
What's goin' on?

30:32.562 --> 30:33.761
What's in it for you?

30:33.763 --> 30:34.828
The boy needed my help.

30:34.830 --> 30:36.533
Isn't that enough?

30:37.733 --> 30:39.800
For the record,
if I do find out

30:39.802 --> 30:41.903
that you're using that
kid for any reason,

30:41.905 --> 30:45.973
any reason at all, I'm gonna
beat the crap out of you.

30:45.975 --> 30:49.743
Aw, you're gonna give
me a knuckle sandwich?

30:49.745 --> 30:51.381
Whatever it takes.

30:52.316 --> 30:53.981
You call that a threat?

30:53.983 --> 30:54.585
Yeah.

30:55.851 --> 30:58.255
I am The Amazing Fabular.

30:59.556 --> 31:00.755
I've invoked the wrath

31:00.757 --> 31:03.924
of several hundred
loyal radio listeners.

31:03.926 --> 31:05.160
I've been threatened
by men the likes

31:05.162 --> 31:08.230
of which would leave you in
need of reconstructive surgery.

31:08.232 --> 31:11.232
What's amazing is
that reasonable people

31:11.234 --> 31:15.305
would actually take advice
from someone like you.

31:20.243 --> 31:22.544
Sorry to bother
you, but my father,

31:22.546 --> 31:24.011
he's a huge fan of your work

31:24.013 --> 31:25.913
and he said the
check's on the house

31:25.915 --> 31:28.717
if we could get your
autograph for the wall.

31:28.719 --> 31:29.550
Sure.

31:29.552 --> 31:31.952
I'd be delighted.

31:31.954 --> 31:34.021
What's your name?

31:34.023 --> 31:37.360
I'm sensing a D?

31:37.994 --> 31:39.760
Daisy.

31:39.762 --> 31:41.262
Wow!

31:41.264 --> 31:42.998
You're really good!

31:43.000 --> 31:45.770
Your show is huge in Australia!

31:46.936 --> 31:49.570
I don't know if you
remember a guy named Mickey

31:49.572 --> 31:52.007
calling in about five years ago?

31:52.009 --> 31:53.674
Yeah, well, anyway, that
was my little brother

31:53.676 --> 31:57.612
and he had lost his
baby kangaroo, Skippy.

31:57.614 --> 31:58.646
Skippy!

31:58.648 --> 31:59.882
Yeah!

31:59.884 --> 32:02.284
So anyway, you said that he
missed his mum and hopped away

32:02.286 --> 32:03.852
and guess what?

32:03.854 --> 32:06.421
Five years later,
my brother called me

32:06.423 --> 32:07.989
and said that he found Skippy

32:07.991 --> 32:10.392
hopping in a field with his mum!

32:10.394 --> 32:11.862
Skippy, he's safe!

32:22.705 --> 32:23.707
Thank you!

32:26.409 --> 32:27.911
How's your nose?

32:31.647 --> 32:33.414
Let's keep moving down
the list, okay, Mason?

32:33.416 --> 32:35.383
All right, yeah.

32:35.385 --> 32:40.020
Well, Janice Bodicker?

32:40.022 --> 32:41.324
It's Bodicker.

32:42.626 --> 32:43.560
Bodicker?

32:45.628 --> 32:47.865
Kinda rolls off the tongue.

32:49.031 --> 32:49.833
Bodicker.

32:53.036 --> 32:54.038
Bodicker!

32:55.705 --> 32:56.506
Bodicker.

33:12.588 --> 33:13.654
Nick.

33:13.656 --> 33:15.723
- Janice.
- This is so exciting!

33:15.725 --> 33:17.358
The girls and I started
baking you a cake

33:17.360 --> 33:18.826
right after you called.

33:18.828 --> 33:20.095
That's so sweet.

33:20.097 --> 33:21.796
You didn't need to
go to the trouble.

33:21.798 --> 33:23.030
Oh, no trouble at all.

33:23.032 --> 33:25.032
The girls just love
when we have company.

33:25.034 --> 33:25.935
Come on in.

33:30.639 --> 33:31.474
Okay!

33:32.876 --> 33:35.977
Why don't you all just
get yourselves acquainted?

33:35.979 --> 33:37.014
Be nice, Donna.

33:39.014 --> 33:40.917
And I'll be right back.

33:44.087 --> 33:45.854
I think I wanna
wait in the car.

33:45.856 --> 33:47.989
Me too, it's so
stuffy in here.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.156
And creepy.

33:49.158 --> 33:53.597
You boys must be thirsty.

33:55.132 --> 33:59.403
The one with the strawberry
in it is yours, Nick.

34:08.543 --> 34:09.612
To true love.

34:11.447 --> 34:12.083
Cheers!

34:13.149 --> 34:14.050
Bottoms up!

34:23.860 --> 34:27.027
Well, okay, so I'm just
gonna get right to it.

34:27.030 --> 34:31.101
We came here to ask you
something really important.

34:33.437 --> 34:34.071
Nick!

34:35.804 --> 34:40.110
I knew that you were here
for more than just a... visit.

34:44.045 --> 34:45.882
Did you and I have...

34:47.050 --> 34:48.514
Say it, say it,
say it, say it!

34:48.516 --> 34:49.149
Just ask, ask, ask, ask, ask...

34:49.150 --> 34:50.551
Did you?

34:56.926 --> 34:59.162
A child together?

35:01.198 --> 35:02.830
Of course we did, Nick.

35:02.832 --> 35:03.666
We did?

35:04.667 --> 35:06.667
That's why I've kept
up on all your success.

35:06.669 --> 35:10.238
I wanted him to be
proud of his daddy.

35:10.240 --> 35:12.540
I knew we'd all be
together again someday.

35:12.542 --> 35:14.475
Oh, god, this is the moment!

35:14.477 --> 35:15.412
Okay, whoo!

35:19.615 --> 35:21.951
Nicky, say hi to your daddy!

35:25.222 --> 35:27.689
We all think he
looks just like you.

35:27.691 --> 35:30.694
It's like, is it
big Nick or little?

35:32.095 --> 35:36.600
Well, go on, just aren't you
gonna say hi to your son, Nick?

35:38.133 --> 35:39.169
Hi?

35:44.006 --> 35:46.975
Okay, I'll just
be a moment, okay!

35:46.977 --> 35:48.209
I'll let you guys talk.

35:48.211 --> 35:49.276
He's gonna cheer you up.

35:49.278 --> 35:51.279
Okay, just let him get settled.

35:51.281 --> 35:53.548
One second, one second.

35:53.550 --> 35:54.781
I'm gonna go
out on a limb here

35:54.783 --> 35:56.517
and say that she
is batshit crazy.

35:56.519 --> 35:57.185
We gotta get
out of this place.

35:57.187 --> 35:58.653
She is not the one you seek.

35:58.655 --> 35:59.587
What about the cake?

35:59.589 --> 36:00.587
Are you kidding me?

36:00.589 --> 36:01.788
I'm starving.

36:01.790 --> 36:04.892
I'm just
adding the nuts!

36:04.894 --> 36:05.727
Mr. Sparkles!

36:05.729 --> 36:06.694
Oh!

36:07.631 --> 36:09.263
You are in trouble, young man.

36:09.265 --> 36:12.869
You scared the living
daylights outta me!

36:13.736 --> 36:14.571
Oh no!

36:15.906 --> 36:17.071
This is bad.

36:17.073 --> 36:18.006
Oh, shoot!

36:18.008 --> 36:20.511
What did you do to my girls?

36:23.078 --> 36:24.111
Oh, god!

36:24.113 --> 36:25.747
Bonnie, are you okay?

36:25.749 --> 36:27.147
I'm terribly sorry

36:27.149 --> 36:27.948
- about this, ma'am.
- I'm calling the police!

36:27.950 --> 36:29.283
You assaulted my girls!

36:29.285 --> 36:30.218
Is there any way I could take

36:30.220 --> 36:32.120
a piece of that for the road?

36:32.122 --> 36:34.555
Get out, get out, get out!

36:34.557 --> 36:35.323
- That's okay.
- Get out!

36:35.325 --> 36:36.256
- Sorry, Amanda!
- Thank you!

36:36.258 --> 36:37.125
Good to see ya, take care!

36:37.127 --> 36:37.962
Hey, no!

36:38.961 --> 36:40.261
That went horribly wrong.

36:40.263 --> 36:41.995
Does this make
Nicky my stepbrother?

36:41.997 --> 36:42.964
Oh, that's very
funny, cake face.

36:42.966 --> 36:44.299
Get in the car.

36:44.301 --> 36:46.066
I told you she wasn't
the one you seek.

36:46.068 --> 36:47.301
Perhaps now you won't
be so quick to dismiss

36:47.303 --> 36:48.303
the gifts of others?

36:48.305 --> 36:49.770
Gift, my ass!

36:49.772 --> 36:51.104
That falls under the
category of obvious.

36:51.106 --> 36:52.040
Gimme the keys.

36:52.042 --> 36:52.906
You drive like an old lady.

36:52.908 --> 36:53.975
Very well.

36:53.977 --> 36:55.877
The gift needs to power down.

36:55.879 --> 36:57.078
Can you power down that shirt?

36:57.080 --> 36:58.249
It's giving me a headache.

37:03.953 --> 37:05.218
Two down, a few more to go.

37:06.856 --> 37:09.756
Are you really gonna
leave without saying goodbye

37:09.758 --> 37:11.761
again, Nick?

37:12.062 --> 37:13.294
Is that a flame thrower?

37:13.296 --> 37:15.296
Where'd she get
a flame thrower?

37:15.298 --> 37:16.930
Drive!

37:51.401 --> 37:52.633
I'm not ready to die!

37:52.635 --> 37:54.137
I don't wanna die!

37:58.207 --> 37:59.774
Hey,
what do you think?

37:59.776 --> 38:00.778
It's great.

38:02.312 --> 38:04.712
What's that look all about?

38:04.714 --> 38:06.913
All right, I hate to be the
one to say, I told you so.

38:06.915 --> 38:10.417
I think you love being the
one to say I told you so.

38:10.419 --> 38:11.519
Okay, yeah.

38:11.521 --> 38:14.421
Fine, that's true but I
only do this to protect you.

38:14.423 --> 38:16.290
I don't need to be
protected from Nick.

38:16.292 --> 38:17.725
Really?

38:17.727 --> 38:19.026
Well, I just got off
the phone with Albert.

38:19.028 --> 38:20.395
Albert, Nick's publisher?

38:20.397 --> 38:22.162
It had to be done.

38:22.164 --> 38:24.332
And when I mentioned him
booking Nick last minute,

38:24.334 --> 38:26.868
he had no idea what
I was talking about.

38:26.870 --> 38:29.736
Kelly, can't you just
be, wait, what, what?

38:29.738 --> 38:33.743
There is no Santa Barbara
speaking engagement.

38:34.810 --> 38:38.245
But why would he tell me that?

38:38.247 --> 38:39.082
Exactly.

38:53.363 --> 38:54.796
Oh, wait.

38:54.798 --> 38:55.729
What are
you looking for?

38:55.731 --> 38:57.365
I lost my phone.

38:57.367 --> 38:58.433
I think you left it
on the coffee table

38:58.435 --> 39:01.736
of the house of your true
love, Janice Bodicker.

39:01.738 --> 39:03.004
Shall we go back and get her?

39:03.006 --> 39:04.404
Never mind, I got insurance.

39:04.406 --> 39:06.073
Did you say this one
is called Winifred?

39:06.075 --> 39:07.908
Yeah, Winny for short.

39:07.910 --> 39:10.778
I'm sensing a
very peculiar aura.

39:10.780 --> 39:12.245
No, that's your rat.

39:12.247 --> 39:16.686
Ever since you fed him that
chimichanga from the Gas 'N Go.

39:17.787 --> 39:18.486
No, this is
something different.

39:18.488 --> 39:20.190
Wait right here.

39:27.397 --> 39:29.964
Is Winifred Cartwright here?

39:29.966 --> 39:31.131
Nick?

39:31.133 --> 39:32.866
Nick Pearson, come here!

39:32.868 --> 39:34.435
Whoa, do I know you, buddy?

39:34.437 --> 39:36.707
Yes, it's me, it's Winny!

39:38.475 --> 39:39.973
Of course, I go by Freddy now.

39:39.975 --> 39:41.444
It's less confusing.

39:44.914 --> 39:47.881
How long you
been Freddy, Winny?

39:47.883 --> 39:50.383
Well, you know, you and
I had that night together

39:50.385 --> 39:53.287
and then the next day
I went and had surgery.

39:53.289 --> 39:54.957
I don't blame you.

39:57.760 --> 40:00.461
I cannot believe I let you
get into my head like this.

40:00.463 --> 40:02.162
Then just call him, Syd.

40:02.164 --> 40:03.363
I don't need to...

40:03.365 --> 40:04.265
That way you'll
know what's going on.

40:04.267 --> 40:06.234
And you're right,
maybe it's nothing.

40:06.236 --> 40:07.468
It's probably nothing.

40:07.470 --> 40:11.339
I mean, I bet it is,
it's something but.

40:11.341 --> 40:14.075
What, it could be nothing.

40:14.077 --> 40:14.912
Okay.

40:21.517 --> 40:22.549
Hello?

40:22.551 --> 40:24.519
I'm sorry, who
am I speaking to?

40:24.521 --> 40:26.187
None of your
business, that's who!

40:26.189 --> 40:28.221
Well, can I speak to Nick?

40:28.223 --> 40:29.156
No, you may not!

40:29.158 --> 40:30.558
He's gone again with no regards

40:30.560 --> 40:32.526
for my feelings or his child!

40:32.528 --> 40:33.560
His child?

40:33.562 --> 40:35.229
What?

40:35.231 --> 40:36.531
I'm sorry.

40:36.533 --> 40:37.531
Are you saying that
you and Nick Pearson

40:37.533 --> 40:39.533
had a child together?

40:39.535 --> 40:40.968
Yes, we did.

40:40.970 --> 40:42.403
A beautiful baby boy.

40:42.405 --> 40:46.006
I now regret ever having
laid eyes on that man!

40:46.008 --> 40:48.042
When he wrote that book,
that hating kids book,

40:48.044 --> 40:49.810
I thought he was
just being funny

40:49.812 --> 40:53.513
but I now know that every
word of it was the truth.

40:53.515 --> 40:55.482
Where is Nick right now?

40:55.484 --> 40:57.051
Hopefully lying
dead in a ditch

40:57.053 --> 40:58.986
with his two friends while
that little dog of theirs

40:58.988 --> 41:00.821
just eats their remains!

41:00.823 --> 41:01.823
He hates dogs.

41:01.825 --> 41:02.924
What?

41:02.926 --> 41:05.192
My advice to you is to
stay as far away as possible

41:05.194 --> 41:06.796
from that deadbeat!

41:08.497 --> 41:10.198
Okay, what is going on?

41:10.200 --> 41:12.500
I think it's pretty clear.

41:12.502 --> 41:15.569
I mean, that woman, she does
not sound normal, and a dog?

41:15.571 --> 41:19.173
Syd, first some kid shows
up claiming he's Nick's son

41:19.175 --> 41:20.374
then Nick lies about
where he is going

41:20.376 --> 41:25.479
and now, this weird woman
admits they had a kid together.

41:25.481 --> 41:26.379
What more do you need?

41:26.381 --> 41:27.348
It's case closed.

41:27.350 --> 41:28.850
I don't think so, Kelly.

41:28.852 --> 41:30.183
I need proof.

41:30.185 --> 41:32.021
Wow, okay.

41:32.622 --> 41:34.354
Somebody's in denial.

41:34.356 --> 41:36.192
Fine, we'll get proof.

41:53.910 --> 41:55.308
I don't understand.

41:55.310 --> 41:57.611
If Winny is Freddy,
why were you asking him

41:57.613 --> 42:00.247
if he had your child?

42:00.249 --> 42:03.250
Because he used to be a woman.

42:03.252 --> 42:05.421
Wow, how do you do that?

42:08.658 --> 42:09.890
You have any hobbies?

42:09.892 --> 42:12.493
You like reading
books or anything?

42:12.495 --> 42:15.229
Sometimes, I read your book.

42:15.231 --> 42:16.596
Really, what'd you think?

42:16.598 --> 42:17.899
It made me wanna write a book.

42:17.901 --> 42:19.000
No way!

42:19.002 --> 42:20.267
That is so cool.

42:20.269 --> 42:22.904
I'm so thrilled I could
inspire a young writer.

42:22.906 --> 42:25.538
I wanted to write a book
called I Hate Parents.

42:25.540 --> 42:26.175
Oh.

42:29.611 --> 42:31.678
So, what is that thing anyway?

42:31.680 --> 42:33.446
It's a fidget spinner.

42:33.448 --> 42:34.582
It helps keep me calm.

42:34.584 --> 42:35.515
Oh, yeah?

42:35.517 --> 42:36.549
I could use one of those.

42:36.551 --> 42:38.451
Look, you don't
have to do this.

42:38.453 --> 42:39.654
What?

42:39.656 --> 42:42.189
Pretend like you like me.

42:42.191 --> 42:44.294
Just help me find my mom.

42:45.361 --> 42:47.297
That's the deal, right?

42:52.068 --> 42:54.669
So why do you hate kids?

42:54.671 --> 42:56.169
I don't hate kids.

42:56.171 --> 42:58.471
I just don't see eye
to eye with them.

42:58.473 --> 43:00.941
It's not so much that I
hate them, they hate me.

43:00.943 --> 43:02.345
I don't hate you.

43:04.680 --> 43:06.613
Does your fiancee
hate kids, too?

43:06.615 --> 43:10.119
No, she just likes
things uncomplicated.

43:11.421 --> 43:14.721
Why are there spoons
in my comforter?

43:14.723 --> 43:16.290
All the butter's gone.

43:16.292 --> 43:18.658
What am I gonna
dip my shrimp in?

43:18.660 --> 43:20.261
What's he dreaming about?

43:20.263 --> 43:23.934
Sounds like he's
channeling Gordon Ramsay.

43:29.671 --> 43:30.907
Oh, great.

43:52.495 --> 43:53.995
License and registration.

43:53.997 --> 43:56.430
Yes, certainly, officer.

43:56.432 --> 43:57.999
You know why I
pulled you over?

43:58.001 --> 43:59.299
Was I going too fast?

43:59.301 --> 44:00.567
The speed limit is 45.

44:00.569 --> 44:02.069
You were doing 50.

44:05.274 --> 44:06.473
This is not my car

44:06.475 --> 44:09.709
so I'm not really used
to how it handles.

44:09.711 --> 44:10.544
It pulls.

44:10.546 --> 44:12.178
Well, that doesn't
change the fact

44:12.180 --> 44:13.113
that you were breaking
the law, now does it?

44:13.115 --> 44:13.714
No, no, no, it doesn't.

44:13.716 --> 44:16.316
Excuse me, officer.

44:16.318 --> 44:17.785
When was the last time
you had your radar gun

44:17.787 --> 44:20.220
calibrated for accuracy?

44:20.222 --> 44:21.654
Excuse me?

44:21.656 --> 44:24.058
Well, you see, many speeding
violations are dismissed

44:24.060 --> 44:25.258
because the citing officer

44:25.260 --> 44:26.794
failed to have regular
maintenance checks

44:26.796 --> 44:28.397
on their equipment.

44:32.100 --> 44:34.671
Don't move, I'll
be right back.

44:37.740 --> 44:38.638
What are you doing?

44:38.640 --> 44:40.040
Helping.

44:40.042 --> 44:41.542
My foster mother used
to be a paralegal

44:41.544 --> 44:43.477
for the law firm of
Dewey, Cheatem & Howe.

44:43.479 --> 44:46.647
No, Mason, that law
firm doesn't exist.

44:46.649 --> 44:47.580
It's an old joke.

44:47.582 --> 44:49.986
I know, I was making a joke.

44:51.220 --> 44:52.055
Oh.

44:54.823 --> 44:57.158
I don't know about the
timing but pretty funny.

44:57.160 --> 44:58.192
All right, Mr. Pearson,

44:58.194 --> 44:59.826
I'm gonna let you go
with a warning this time.

44:59.828 --> 45:00.794
Watch your speed.

45:00.796 --> 45:02.629
Thank you.

45:02.631 --> 45:03.564
And one more thing.

45:03.566 --> 45:04.698
Mm-hmm?

45:04.700 --> 45:05.832
Hey, brother,
can I have your autograph?

45:05.834 --> 45:07.634
I'd be happy to, always.

45:07.636 --> 45:08.836
Man, my wife and I,

45:08.838 --> 45:12.506
we listen to you on
the radio all the time.

45:12.508 --> 45:15.709
You have admirable
qualities, officer.

45:15.711 --> 45:17.578
I'm sensing a promotion
in your future.

45:17.580 --> 45:19.080
Well, actually, I'm puttin' in

45:19.082 --> 45:20.080
for early retirement
in three months.

45:20.082 --> 45:22.750
Yes, which will promote
healthy relaxation

45:22.752 --> 45:24.685
in your previously hectic life.

45:26.122 --> 45:29.292
You can say that
again, Mr. Fabular.

45:30.193 --> 45:31.125
All right, man.

45:31.127 --> 45:32.392
Hey, you drive safely now.

45:32.394 --> 45:34.694
- All right.
- Of course, of course.

45:34.696 --> 45:36.633
You watch your speed.

45:39.234 --> 45:40.234
No need to thank me.

45:40.236 --> 45:40.868
Thank you?

45:40.870 --> 45:42.336
For what?

45:42.338 --> 45:43.270
For extruding us
from that awkward

45:43.272 --> 45:44.872
and embarrassing confrontation.

45:44.874 --> 45:46.540
You had nothing to do with it.

45:46.542 --> 45:48.109
I most certainly had
everything to do with it.

45:48.111 --> 45:51.745
I was manipulating and
deflecting his negative energy.

45:51.747 --> 45:53.180
Thank you, Fabular.

45:53.182 --> 45:54.448
Yeah, thank you, Master Yoda.

45:54.450 --> 45:55.381
Now shut up, please.

45:55.383 --> 45:57.317
Who's next on the list?

45:57.319 --> 45:59.720
Christine Hurley.

46:06.194 --> 46:07.361
Do you see anything?

46:07.363 --> 46:08.765
Get in there, go!

46:11.667 --> 46:13.700
Oh, I just, I
don't feel good about this.

46:13.702 --> 46:14.868
I think we should go back home.

46:14.870 --> 46:15.803
What?

46:15.805 --> 46:17.370
He gave you a key, didn't he?

46:17.372 --> 46:18.705
By giving you a
key it is implied

46:18.707 --> 46:19.707
that you have
permission to gain entry

46:19.709 --> 46:22.475
at any time to the
domicile said key unlocks.

46:22.477 --> 46:23.711
I'm pretty
certain that implication

46:23.713 --> 46:25.412
doesn't mean scavenging
said domicile

46:25.414 --> 46:26.513
for dirty little secrets.

46:26.515 --> 46:27.448
Okay, you know what?

46:27.450 --> 46:28.182
I take no pleasure in this.

46:28.184 --> 46:30.151
Yes, you do.

46:30.153 --> 46:30.884
Okay, I do.

46:30.886 --> 46:31.919
Okay, yes, I do, a little bit.

46:31.921 --> 46:32.919
But again, it's all for you.

46:32.921 --> 46:34.154
I'm pretty certain you
missed your true calling

46:34.156 --> 46:36.323
as a criminal mastermind but
let's just get this over with

46:36.325 --> 46:37.825
and we'll get out of here.

46:37.827 --> 46:38.859
Patience, Syd.

46:38.861 --> 46:40.528
This might take a while.

46:40.530 --> 46:41.662
Even Nick wouldn't
be foolish enough

46:41.664 --> 46:46.202
to just leave a big box of
evidence out in the open.

46:56.345 --> 46:57.944
You
never mentioned you dated Oprah.

46:57.946 --> 46:59.279
I always
figured Christine

46:59.281 --> 47:00.948
would land in the lap of luxury.

47:00.950 --> 47:02.950
Face first, from
the looks of it.

47:02.952 --> 47:05.689
Wow, I would
totally live here.

47:06.888 --> 47:10.424
Maybe you two should
hang back for the moment.

47:10.426 --> 47:14.361
I don't wanna just
thrust this in her face.

47:14.363 --> 47:15.729
Seems like that's
how you got yourself

47:15.731 --> 47:17.765
in this situation to begin with.

47:17.767 --> 47:18.832
Hilarious.

47:18.834 --> 47:19.870
Wait here.

47:29.511 --> 47:32.412
Don't just stand there.

47:32.414 --> 47:33.214
Wow.

47:33.216 --> 47:34.915
I have to be at
UCLA in one hour

47:34.917 --> 47:36.649
to give my speech on
women's empowerment

47:36.651 --> 47:38.419
in the social media arena.

47:38.421 --> 47:40.821
The helicopter will be
here in five minutes.

47:40.823 --> 47:42.589
How fast can you tweet?

47:42.591 --> 47:43.524
Huh, I don't know.

47:43.526 --> 47:44.991
Strike two.

47:44.993 --> 47:46.459
If you want this job, you'd
better pick up the pace.

47:46.461 --> 47:47.428
- Job?
- I require someone

47:47.430 --> 47:48.796
who can manage my schedule,

47:48.798 --> 47:51.564
count my calories feed my geckos

47:51.566 --> 47:54.535
and make sure I don't
wear the same dress twice.

47:54.537 --> 47:57.904
If you last two weeks, I'll
double your salary, okay?

47:57.906 --> 48:00.908
I'm not here for
the job, Christine.

48:00.910 --> 48:01.875
Who are you?

48:01.877 --> 48:04.912
It's me, Nick, Nick Pearson.

48:04.914 --> 48:06.749
Nick, Nick!

48:07.749 --> 48:08.383
Oh!

48:09.885 --> 48:11.951
I didn't recognize you, Nick.

48:11.953 --> 48:13.957
Oh, you didn't age well.

48:16.425 --> 48:17.857
You're not on my schedule.

48:17.859 --> 48:20.461
I know, I called you
an hour ago, remember?

48:20.463 --> 48:21.861
This is why I
need an assistant.

48:21.863 --> 48:23.730
I think I can fit
you in on Thursday.

48:23.732 --> 48:24.865
No, I gotta talk
to you right now.

48:24.867 --> 48:25.966
It's important.

48:25.968 --> 48:29.270
Okay, you have 35 seconds, go.

48:29.272 --> 48:30.703
Okay.

48:30.705 --> 48:34.408
Did you and I have a child

48:34.410 --> 48:38.412
that you secretly gave up
for adoption, by any chance?

48:38.414 --> 48:40.881
Why would you ask me that?

48:40.883 --> 48:42.383
Because this kid out here

48:42.385 --> 48:45.386
deserves to know
who his mother is.

48:45.388 --> 48:47.888
Well, he's awfully big.

48:47.890 --> 48:49.555
Does baldness run
in your family?

48:49.557 --> 48:50.691
Not him!

48:50.693 --> 48:51.924
The other one!

48:51.926 --> 48:52.792
Nick, for someone
who writes comedy,

48:52.794 --> 48:55.662
you really can't
take a joke, can you?

48:55.664 --> 48:56.863
I'm a little off my game.

48:56.865 --> 48:58.031
Sorry, Nick, I can't help you.

48:58.033 --> 48:58.966
It wasn't me.

48:58.968 --> 49:01.301
Tell the kid I'm sorry.

49:01.303 --> 49:02.939
Sorry to bother you.

49:04.774 --> 49:05.775
Hey, Nick?

49:06.709 --> 49:08.941
For whatever it's worth,
I can't have kids.

49:08.943 --> 49:11.912
You would have found that
out if you'd stuck around.

49:11.914 --> 49:12.979
I built my empire instead.

49:12.981 --> 49:15.049
Everything happens for a reason.

49:15.051 --> 49:16.486
Bye, good luck.

49:23.392 --> 49:24.957
Another dead end?

49:24.959 --> 49:25.794
Yup.

49:32.868 --> 49:37.607
You really flushed that
golden ticket down the commode.

49:50.419 --> 49:51.685
There are more women here

49:51.687 --> 49:53.754
than in my entire
graduating class.

49:53.756 --> 49:55.756
My class was huge, remember?

49:55.758 --> 49:56.589
Want chips?

49:56.591 --> 49:58.058
No, Kelly.

49:58.060 --> 50:00.127
I still have to fit into
my wedding dress, remember?

50:00.129 --> 50:02.595
Seriously, Nick should be
bronzed and put on exhibit

50:02.597 --> 50:05.499
at the Alfred Kinsey museum.

50:05.501 --> 50:07.100
Oh, there's another one.

50:07.102 --> 50:10.807
That makes three
Christines at last count.

50:12.607 --> 50:13.709
Oh, my God.

50:14.776 --> 50:16.642
Nick is a gigolo.

50:16.644 --> 50:18.078
What?

50:18.080 --> 50:19.613
No, I don't think it says
anything about him getting paid.

50:19.615 --> 50:21.381
He's just a slut.

50:21.383 --> 50:22.116
You're right!

50:22.118 --> 50:23.783
He's a slut!

50:23.785 --> 50:26.386
And all this time,
he's been lying to me

50:26.388 --> 50:31.024
and keeping secrets from
me and I've been an idiot!

50:31.026 --> 50:33.060
All signs do point
to yes on that one.

50:33.062 --> 50:34.928
So what do I do?

50:34.930 --> 50:36.095
I don't know what to do!

50:36.097 --> 50:40.133
I just need, I need
a little more time.

50:40.135 --> 50:41.100
Sydney.

50:41.102 --> 50:43.002
Just a little more time.

50:43.004 --> 50:44.037
Nope, time is now.

50:44.039 --> 50:45.506
What?

50:45.508 --> 50:46.540
It's time.

50:46.542 --> 50:48.075
- Oh, my god!
- We gotta go.

50:48.077 --> 50:49.642
Wait, no.

50:49.644 --> 50:51.779
Cover that, put something
on that chair on the mark.

50:51.781 --> 50:52.745
Do you
want the chips?

50:52.747 --> 50:54.415
Okay, yeah, bring the chips.

50:54.417 --> 50:56.582
I gotta call Richard.

50:59.655 --> 51:00.787
How're you doing?

51:00.789 --> 51:02.423
Fine.

51:02.425 --> 51:03.890
I wish I had some ice cream.

51:03.892 --> 51:07.093
Oh, well, maybe later
we'll get you some.

51:07.095 --> 51:08.694
That'd be great.

51:08.696 --> 51:10.129
What's your favorite flavor?

51:10.131 --> 51:10.964
Strawberry.

51:10.966 --> 51:14.066
No way, that's
my favorite flavor.

51:14.068 --> 51:15.334
What are the odds?

51:15.336 --> 51:19.573
I mean, a lot of people like
strawberry, so not that high.

51:19.575 --> 51:22.209
Ooh, ooh, Richard, Richard!

51:22.211 --> 51:24.812
Answer your stupid phone!

51:24.814 --> 51:26.015
Okay, okay, okay.

51:27.182 --> 51:29.216
Ow, they're really
coming fast now!

51:29.218 --> 51:31.017
Just try to stay calm, Kelly.

51:31.019 --> 51:32.919
Why did you let me
eat all the chips?

51:32.921 --> 51:35.087
I'm gonna be gassy
in the delivery room!

51:35.089 --> 51:37.124
Do not worry about
that right now!

51:37.126 --> 51:39.959
I would just relax and try to
concentrate on whatever it is

51:39.961 --> 51:41.662
they tell you to concentrate on

51:41.664 --> 51:43.129
in those La Paz
classes you took!

51:43.131 --> 51:44.497
I wasn't listening!

51:44.499 --> 51:46.066
It's Lamaze!

51:46.068 --> 51:47.700
And how am I supposed to
relax when my Lamaze partner

51:47.702 --> 51:50.102
won't even answer
his phone, god!

51:50.104 --> 51:51.805
Richard, hi, it's your wife.

51:51.807 --> 51:52.939
I'm gonna kill you!

51:52.941 --> 51:55.042
Just breathe with me.

51:55.044 --> 51:56.977
I don't
know what to do!

51:56.979 --> 51:59.015
Sorry, that's just chips.

52:00.115 --> 52:01.048
I'm having a baby!

52:01.050 --> 52:02.249
How can he be stuck in traffic?

52:02.251 --> 52:03.250
There's always
traffic on the 405.

52:03.252 --> 52:04.250
He'll be here.

52:04.252 --> 52:05.151
Oh, my god, he's not
gonna be here in time!

52:05.153 --> 52:07.087
No, no, no, no, I
can't do this alone!

52:07.089 --> 52:08.855
Syd, Syd, you have to
come in there with me!

52:08.857 --> 52:09.923
Oh, no, no, I can't do that.

52:09.925 --> 52:11.158
Yes, yes, you can!

52:11.160 --> 52:12.093
I am your sister and
I say you have to!

52:12.095 --> 52:13.627
Don't they have,
like, stand-by people,

52:13.629 --> 52:14.727
like rent-a-coaches
or something?

52:14.729 --> 52:16.229
Syd, Sydney!

52:16.231 --> 52:18.765
You have to do this or I
will tell everyone in here

52:18.767 --> 52:20.767
how you shit your pants at
Neil Greenblatt's bar mitzvah

52:20.769 --> 52:22.535
and then you flushed your
underpants down the toilet

52:22.537 --> 52:24.104
and flooded the entire
basement of the synagogue.

52:24.106 --> 52:25.506
That was like 20 years ago.

52:25.508 --> 52:26.607
I don't care!

52:26.609 --> 52:28.174
I'm about to launch a
watermelon out of my punani!

52:28.176 --> 52:30.877
Do not test me, Sydney!

52:30.879 --> 52:31.944
Here we are.

52:31.946 --> 52:33.082
947 Main Street.

52:34.517 --> 52:35.218
Cross Hakido.

52:36.252 --> 52:38.151
Wow, this place looks amazing.

52:38.153 --> 52:39.986
I'm gonna sit this one
out and take Mr. Sparkles

52:39.988 --> 52:41.988
on a much needed stroll.

52:41.990 --> 52:43.122
We'll see you back here.

52:43.124 --> 52:44.258
Okay.

52:44.260 --> 52:45.292
Let's step that punch!

52:46.528 --> 52:47.160
Single punch!

52:47.997 --> 52:48.828
Two!

52:48.830 --> 52:49.696
Three!

52:49.698 --> 52:50.897
Four!

52:50.899 --> 52:52.131
Attention.

52:57.772 --> 52:59.205
Hey, Nick!

52:59.207 --> 53:00.140
Hi, Schyler.

53:00.142 --> 53:01.008
You look great.

53:01.010 --> 53:02.843
This place is fantastic.

53:02.845 --> 53:05.979
Yeah, and after two
years, I'm the owner.

53:05.981 --> 53:08.015
Are you like a ninja?

53:08.017 --> 53:09.283
Almost.

53:09.285 --> 53:10.283
What's your name?

53:10.285 --> 53:11.285
Mason.

53:11.287 --> 53:13.120
Yeah, would you like
to join my class today?

53:13.122 --> 53:14.321
Sure!

53:14.323 --> 53:15.321
Okay, there's
extra gis over there

53:15.323 --> 53:16.723
in the changing room.

53:16.725 --> 53:17.624
Just put one on and
then come out to the mat

53:17.626 --> 53:18.558
and join the class.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.294
Okay, thanks!

53:20.296 --> 53:21.194
He's a sweet kid.

53:21.196 --> 53:22.629
Mm-hmm.

53:22.631 --> 53:23.729
What's he doing
with a nut like you

53:23.731 --> 53:25.732
and what do you want from me?

53:25.734 --> 53:29.236
Well, it's a bit of
a delicate situation.

53:29.238 --> 53:30.970
I need to talk about us.

53:30.972 --> 53:31.872
Us?

53:31.874 --> 53:33.276
As in you and me?

53:34.276 --> 53:38.013
Yeah, it could also
involve other parties.

53:40.015 --> 53:41.647
Interesting.

53:41.649 --> 53:44.153
Okay, five-minute water break!

53:45.287 --> 53:46.752
I'll tell you what, Nick.

53:46.754 --> 53:48.321
I'm a little short-handed today.

53:48.323 --> 53:49.890
Why don't you help me out
for the next 30 minutes

53:49.892 --> 53:52.993
and maybe I'll answer
your questions.

53:52.995 --> 53:54.962
Help you out?

53:54.964 --> 53:56.099
Doing what?

53:58.968 --> 54:00.232
Is this completely necessary?

54:00.234 --> 54:04.071
You want your questions
answered or not?

54:04.073 --> 54:05.037
Yeah.

54:05.039 --> 54:06.305
Line up!

54:06.307 --> 54:07.309
Yes, ma'am!

54:10.713 --> 54:12.812
On your knees.

54:17.185 --> 54:19.752
Oh, I'm so glad
you're so amused.

54:19.754 --> 54:21.254
Side kicks!

54:24.627 --> 54:26.158
Little lower next time, sweetie.

54:26.160 --> 54:27.361
Could we take this seriously?

54:27.363 --> 54:28.227
I need to find
this kid's mother.

54:28.229 --> 54:29.363
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick,

54:29.365 --> 54:31.397
but talk about a
needle in the haystack.

54:31.399 --> 54:32.399
Well, I'll take
that to be a no?

54:32.401 --> 54:33.834
Front kick!

54:35.169 --> 54:36.403
Believe me, Nick,
if we had a baby,

54:36.405 --> 54:38.104
you would have known
about it from day one.

54:38.106 --> 54:39.872
Why don't you ask Tonya Wesson?

54:39.874 --> 54:41.274
Tonya Wesson?

54:41.276 --> 54:42.975
Who's Tonya Wesson?

54:42.977 --> 54:45.044
Oh, now don't tell me
you don't remember Tonya.

54:45.046 --> 54:48.314
Remember, my friend Tonya?

54:48.316 --> 54:49.216
The one I caught you with

54:49.218 --> 54:51.685
when you and I were
supposedly dating?

54:51.687 --> 54:54.921
Oh, Tonya Wesson, yeah.

54:54.923 --> 54:56.189
Well, I mean, that's
hardly my fault.

54:56.191 --> 54:58.424
It takes two to tango, you know?

54:58.426 --> 55:01.060
Yeah, but it only
takes one to say no.

55:01.062 --> 55:02.029
Crotch kick!

55:12.441 --> 55:13.874
What's wrong with you?

55:13.876 --> 55:15.241
Move!

55:15.243 --> 55:18.345
You don't let everybody
in front of you!

55:18.347 --> 55:20.714
Come on, drive!

55:22.251 --> 55:23.216
Hey, baby!

55:23.218 --> 55:24.817
How's it going, huh?

55:24.819 --> 55:25.986
How far away are you?

55:25.988 --> 55:29.321
I don't know,
maybe 20, 30 minutes?

55:29.323 --> 55:30.323
I'm gonna kill you!

55:30.325 --> 55:31.258
I'm on my way!

55:31.260 --> 55:32.359
I am coming, don't worry!

55:32.361 --> 55:34.093
You're gonna
stay on this phone

55:34.095 --> 55:36.229
until you get here or this
baby does, do you hear me?

55:36.231 --> 55:37.698
Yup, yup.

55:37.700 --> 55:39.066
Come on, I
gotta get to work!

55:39.068 --> 55:40.399
I'm stayin' on the phone.

55:40.401 --> 55:41.368
Thanks for your help, Nick.

55:41.370 --> 55:43.803
Oh, sure, anytime.

55:43.805 --> 55:45.337
Hey, Fabular, check it out!

55:46.874 --> 55:48.475
Oh, that's impressive.

55:48.477 --> 55:50.910
The next time I need a bodyguard,
I'm gonna give you a call.

55:50.912 --> 55:53.946
Well, it is a small
world after all.

55:53.948 --> 55:56.415
Hello, Ernie, long time no see.

55:56.417 --> 55:57.984
I beg your pardon?

55:57.986 --> 55:59.453
I think you made a mistake.

55:59.455 --> 56:00.720
This is The Amazing Fabular.

56:00.722 --> 56:02.354
Oh, yes, yes it is.

56:02.356 --> 56:04.390
Also known as Ernie Swanson.

56:04.392 --> 56:08.462
Cerritos Clown
University, class of 1994.

56:08.464 --> 56:10.129
You went to Clown College?

56:10.131 --> 56:11.365
You bet he did.

56:11.367 --> 56:14.500
Only unlike the rest of our
class who dedicated our talents

56:14.502 --> 56:16.736
to the entertaining of children,

56:16.738 --> 56:19.439
Ernie here parlayed his skills
into bilking aging actresses

56:19.441 --> 56:21.841
and rich widows out of
their bank accounts.

56:21.843 --> 56:23.276
How dare you!

56:23.278 --> 56:24.477
Is that true?

56:24.479 --> 56:26.178
Of course not!

56:26.180 --> 56:28.848
I've never laid eyes on
this wannabe Jackie Chan!

56:28.850 --> 56:30.015
Oh, yeah, yeah, all right.

56:30.017 --> 56:31.517
Well, maybe this
will jog your memory?

56:31.519 --> 56:34.187
I was there the night Ernie
here got so loaded on grog

56:34.189 --> 56:35.388
at the Renaissance fair,

56:35.390 --> 56:40.127
he got a drawing of Justin
Timberlake tattooed on his butt!

56:40.129 --> 56:41.428
I will not stand here

56:41.430 --> 56:45.165
and listen to any more of
this psychotic slander!

56:45.167 --> 56:47.500
Look, Nick, I meant
what I said before.

56:47.502 --> 56:49.136
I wish you luck.

56:49.138 --> 56:51.337
But if you're receiving
messages from this con artist,

56:51.339 --> 56:54.875
then you're gonna need a
whole lot more than luck.

56:54.877 --> 56:56.977
Mason, you're a good kid.

56:56.979 --> 56:58.477
I hope you find your mom.

56:58.479 --> 56:59.715
Thanks.

57:01.950 --> 57:04.216
Goodness, this
creature has taken leave!

57:04.218 --> 57:05.519
It's no wonder Mr. Sparkles

57:05.521 --> 57:09.425
didn't leap to my defense
and rip out her jugular!

57:11.225 --> 57:13.859
Mason, will you just
hang out here for a second?

57:13.861 --> 57:16.095
I'm gonna talk to
Fabbie for a minute.

57:16.097 --> 57:17.798
- Okay.
- What are you doing?

57:17.800 --> 57:18.832
Oh, come on.

57:18.834 --> 57:20.500
Okay, unhand me!

57:20.502 --> 57:21.567
Show me your ass.

57:21.569 --> 57:22.535
What are you,

57:22.537 --> 57:24.136
You let me go right now!

57:24.138 --> 57:25.337
- Show me your ass right now!
- Let me go right now!

57:25.339 --> 57:26.538
Look, I'm gonna ask
you one last time,

57:26.540 --> 57:30.410
do you or do you not have
Justin Timberlake on your ass?

57:30.412 --> 57:31.377
So that's it?

57:31.379 --> 57:32.578
That's how you treat a friend?

57:32.580 --> 57:34.080
We are not friends.

57:34.082 --> 57:36.283
So you'd just take the
word of a total stranger?

57:36.285 --> 57:39.386
You're the total stranger.

57:39.388 --> 57:43.490
And this hereby terminates
our association.

57:43.492 --> 57:44.857
I don't wanna see you.

57:44.859 --> 57:46.292
I don't wanna hear from you.

57:46.294 --> 57:49.995
You get back into your
Fab-Mobile, get outta here.

57:49.997 --> 57:51.434
Nicholas, wait.

57:56.571 --> 58:00.073
Don't speak bad of me in
front of the boy, okay?

58:00.075 --> 58:02.944
You don't know what
he means to me.

58:04.479 --> 58:06.479
That woman was right.

58:06.481 --> 58:09.218
I'm a fake, a
fraud, a charlatan.

58:12.086 --> 58:15.055
I've spent most of my life
duping people out of money

58:15.057 --> 58:21.229
by pretending to offer
them hope, faith, closure.

58:21.562 --> 58:22.529
Why are you
telling me this now?

58:22.531 --> 58:23.165
Because

58:26.068 --> 58:28.567
when that boy popped in my head,

58:28.569 --> 58:31.406
I instantly knew
things about him.

58:32.573 --> 58:36.977
I could feel his confusion,
I could feel his pain,

58:36.979 --> 58:39.345
I could feel his loneliness.

58:39.347 --> 58:41.550
And I knew I had to help him.

58:44.553 --> 58:46.653
You accused me of stealing
money from his foster mother.

58:46.655 --> 58:50.089
I have not taken a single penny.

58:50.091 --> 58:54.660
'Cause that boy offers
something far more valuable.

58:54.662 --> 58:59.534
He makes me believe I can be
a better version of myself.

59:03.437 --> 59:06.406
And I know if, given
the opportunity,

59:06.408 --> 59:09.145
he can do the same
thing for you.

59:12.680 --> 59:16.151
I really wanna
believe you right now.

59:20.622 --> 59:22.689
Well, believe this.

59:22.691 --> 59:24.658
If you cut me out
of that boy's life,

59:24.660 --> 59:26.526
I will never help you again.

59:26.528 --> 59:30.265
And mark my words, you're
gonna need my help.

59:32.033 --> 59:34.700
Well, I guess
we'll never know.

59:34.702 --> 59:35.537
Up, up.

59:43.946 --> 59:45.147
Good luck, Mason.

59:46.013 --> 59:49.316
Sorry I can't finish our quest.

59:49.318 --> 59:51.586
I have a speech to deliver.

01:00:06.001 --> 01:00:07.734
Okay, everything's
looking great, Kelly.

01:00:07.736 --> 01:00:08.600
- Good.
- Just keep

01:00:08.602 --> 01:00:09.736
doing your breathing.

01:00:09.738 --> 01:00:11.705
Great, Richard, breathing.

01:00:11.707 --> 01:00:13.339
I wasn't listening, I'm sorry!

01:00:13.341 --> 01:00:14.274
Okay, breathe, baby.

01:00:14.276 --> 01:00:16.245
One, two, three, breathe.

01:00:21.283 --> 01:00:22.582
Very good.

01:00:22.584 --> 01:00:24.084
- Doing great?
- Great, you're doing great!

01:00:24.086 --> 01:00:25.017
Now we're gonna
to start to push, okay?

01:00:25.019 --> 01:00:27.555
Okay, yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:00:29.490 --> 01:00:30.323
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

01:00:30.325 --> 01:00:31.256
Wait, wait, wait!

01:00:31.258 --> 01:00:31.991
You have to sing the song!

01:00:31.993 --> 01:00:32.691
What song?

01:00:32.693 --> 01:00:34.160
Richard, tell her!

01:00:34.162 --> 01:00:36.129
Deep Inside of You
by Third Eye Blind.

01:00:36.131 --> 01:00:37.663
Why do I have
to sing that song?

01:00:37.665 --> 01:00:38.531
'Cause that was
the song that was playing

01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:39.665
when Kelly and I
were making our baby.

01:00:39.667 --> 01:00:41.368
Didn't need to know that.

01:00:41.370 --> 01:00:44.337
No, no, but wait, wait,
we promised each other

01:00:44.339 --> 01:00:47.272
that we'd sing this
song during the birth.

01:00:47.274 --> 01:00:48.241
So just sing it!

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:49.542
I don't know the words!

01:00:49.544 --> 01:00:51.276
It's okay, you
guys sing the chorus

01:00:51.278 --> 01:00:54.214
and I'll help you
get through it.

just one good, strong push.

01:01:30.618 --> 01:01:32.051
Right, okay, okay.

01:01:32.053 --> 01:01:34.053
I'm gonna push now.

01:01:34.055 --> 01:01:35.724
- Ready?
- Push, push!

01:01:43.064 --> 01:01:44.531
Richard!

01:01:48.769 --> 01:01:52.071
Hi!

01:01:52.073 --> 01:01:53.540
Aw, Kelly, you did it!

01:02:09.223 --> 01:02:11.227
Hi, Joanna, it's Nick.

01:02:12.359 --> 01:02:14.861
Yeah, we had some
unexpected diversions

01:02:14.863 --> 01:02:17.165
but we're on our way now.

01:02:18.133 --> 01:02:18.768
Who's we?

01:02:20.102 --> 01:02:21.366
That's why I'm
calling you again.

01:02:21.368 --> 01:02:22.836
I have to ask you something

01:02:22.838 --> 01:02:26.506
before we waste
each other's time.

01:02:26.508 --> 01:02:29.812
And forgive me for
being blunt about this.

01:02:33.414 --> 01:02:36.816
Did you and I have a kid
together that I'm unaware of

01:02:36.818 --> 01:02:39.522
that you gave up for adoption?

01:02:56.437 --> 01:02:58.673
So what are we doing now?

01:03:00.175 --> 01:03:02.778
We're gonna go
meet your mother.

01:03:07.883 --> 01:03:09.318
Are you sleepy?

01:03:10.519 --> 01:03:12.588
Look at the little hands.

01:03:14.421 --> 01:03:16.455
Thank you for
being here with me.

01:03:16.457 --> 01:03:17.689
And thank you for singing.

01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:20.292
I'm very sorry I did
not know the words.

01:03:20.294 --> 01:03:20.926
Was I horrible?

01:03:20.928 --> 01:03:23.296
No, you were perfect.

01:03:23.298 --> 01:03:25.198
She's so beautiful.

01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.667
Yeah, this may prevent me

01:03:28.669 --> 01:03:30.904
from being your maid
of honor on Sunday.

01:03:30.906 --> 01:03:32.272
I'm not so sure
there's gonna be a need

01:03:32.274 --> 01:03:33.906
for a maid of honor Sunday.

01:03:33.908 --> 01:03:35.475
What?

01:03:35.477 --> 01:03:39.611
Why, you're still gonna
marry Nick, aren't you?

01:03:39.613 --> 01:03:41.617
So he has a lot of exes.

01:03:43.185 --> 01:03:43.786
And he lied.

01:03:44.752 --> 01:03:46.618
And he may have some
illegitimate children

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:51.626
you don't know about but
still, you two belong together.

01:03:52.794 --> 01:03:54.629
Wait, what are
you talking about?

01:03:56.531 --> 01:03:58.698
You just spent the last 48
hours trying to convince me

01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:00.265
Nick is a monster.

01:04:00.267 --> 01:04:02.935
What about protecting me?

01:04:02.937 --> 01:04:03.771
Yeah.

01:04:06.874 --> 01:04:09.709
I'm all done protecting you.

01:04:09.711 --> 01:04:13.312
I have someone else
to protect now.

01:04:13.314 --> 01:04:14.580
I did it, baby!

01:04:14.582 --> 01:04:16.216
I made it to the
hospital, I'm here!

01:04:16.218 --> 01:04:17.816
I'm coming!

01:04:17.818 --> 01:04:18.850
Okay, love you.

01:04:18.852 --> 01:04:19.986
I know!

01:04:19.988 --> 01:04:21.323
I love you, too!

01:04:23.258 --> 01:04:24.957
So Nick may have
sowed more seed

01:04:24.959 --> 01:04:26.625
than John Deere in the past.

01:04:26.627 --> 01:04:30.930
You are the one he chose to
spend the rest of his life with.

01:04:30.932 --> 01:04:31.800
He loves you.

01:04:36.238 --> 01:04:39.175
And I know that you are gonna
make the right decision.

01:04:43.377 --> 01:04:44.877
Oh!

01:04:44.879 --> 01:04:46.412
Sorry, I'm late.

01:04:46.414 --> 01:04:47.846
Did I miss something?

01:04:47.848 --> 01:04:50.015
You're so stupid.

01:04:50.017 --> 01:04:51.618
Meet your daughter.

01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:52.884
It's a girl?

01:04:52.886 --> 01:04:54.921
Stephanie Jenkins Kowalski.

01:04:54.923 --> 01:04:56.457
Oh!

01:05:00.495 --> 01:05:02.397
She's totally asleep.

01:05:18.345 --> 01:05:19.948
This is it, 305.

01:05:25.787 --> 01:05:26.852
You ready?

01:05:26.854 --> 01:05:28.654
I think so.

01:05:28.656 --> 01:05:29.892
Come on then.

01:05:34.328 --> 01:05:35.560
It's gonna be okay.

01:05:35.562 --> 01:05:37.497
This is what you've
been waiting for.

01:05:37.499 --> 01:05:39.432
Yeah, I'm just
a little nervous.

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:40.269
Me too.

01:05:43.838 --> 01:05:45.404
Stand up straight.

01:05:45.406 --> 01:05:47.874
First impressions are
essential to new relationships,

01:05:47.876 --> 01:05:49.011
don't you think?

01:05:52.479 --> 01:05:55.848
Well, it took you long enough.

01:05:55.850 --> 01:05:57.582
Look at you, Nick.

01:05:57.584 --> 01:05:58.817
You look like the
same self-centered ass

01:05:58.819 --> 01:06:01.020
I fell for all those years ago.

01:06:01.022 --> 01:06:04.026
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

01:06:05.493 --> 01:06:06.328
This him?

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:08.928
What is his name again?

01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:10.363
My name's Mason.

01:06:10.365 --> 01:06:11.798
It's nice to meet you.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:13.098
Mason?

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.100
Did I name you that?

01:06:15.102 --> 01:06:16.868
What kind of name is Mason?

01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:19.971
Like a cartoon
moose or something.

01:06:19.973 --> 01:06:21.743
You know what I mean?

01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:24.042
I'm kidding, it's cute.

01:06:24.044 --> 01:06:27.615
Come on in, meet your
brothers and sisters.

01:06:31.986 --> 01:06:33.022
Hey!

01:06:37.492 --> 01:06:38.924
Mason, I don't know
if you ate, hon.

01:06:38.926 --> 01:06:43.395
We have Easy Mac or
Cap'n Crunch if you want.

01:06:43.397 --> 01:06:44.730
I'm okay, thanks.

01:06:44.732 --> 01:06:45.564
Okay.

01:06:45.566 --> 01:06:47.435
Hey, listen up.

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:52.372
This is Mason, he's
your new brother.

01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:55.077
This is Frankie,
Lenny, Johnny and,

01:06:56.877 --> 01:06:57.713
Todd.

01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.413
I was going to meetings
when I had him, so.

01:07:01.415 --> 01:07:03.816
So this little cutie is Rachel.

01:07:03.818 --> 01:07:05.084
Can you say hello?

01:07:05.086 --> 01:07:06.451
Yeah.

01:07:06.453 --> 01:07:08.120
Where's their dad?

01:07:08.122 --> 01:07:11.457
Lock-up, rehab, shacked up
with a pole dancer in Barstow

01:07:11.459 --> 01:07:13.058
and buried in Texas.

01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:14.993
But we don't talk about that.

01:07:14.995 --> 01:07:17.397
Frankie, here, take your sister.

01:07:17.399 --> 01:07:20.031
Get that crap out of your hair.

01:07:20.033 --> 01:07:21.002
Get her a toy.

01:07:22.636 --> 01:07:24.035
Mason, why don't you sit
with the boys and watch TV

01:07:24.037 --> 01:07:26.439
while your daddy and I
have a little talk, okay?

01:07:26.441 --> 01:07:28.042
Yeah, yeah, sure.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.015
Hey, guys.

01:07:43.057 --> 01:07:44.689
All right, I'll take him.

01:07:44.691 --> 01:07:46.426
You'll take him?

01:07:46.428 --> 01:07:49.629
Yeah, that's why you came
all the way here, isn't it?

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:52.131
Obviously you don't want him.

01:07:52.133 --> 01:07:56.071
Well, it's not that I
don't want him, I just

01:07:56.905 --> 01:07:57.870
have my reasons.

01:07:57.872 --> 01:07:58.671
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:07:58.673 --> 01:08:00.508
You boys always
have your reasons.

01:08:03.678 --> 01:08:05.381
Why didn't you ever tell me?

01:08:07.582 --> 01:08:09.417
You were gone, Nick.

01:08:11.653 --> 01:08:13.185
You disappeared on me.

01:08:13.187 --> 01:08:17.223
No goodbye, no good luck,
not even a good riddance.

01:08:17.225 --> 01:08:18.590
I'm sorry.

01:08:18.591 --> 01:08:19.892
Oh, no.

01:08:19.894 --> 01:08:22.562
I'm sure you had your reasons.

01:08:22.564 --> 01:08:23.464
I had mine.

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:28.036
I was young, scared, alone.

01:08:31.171 --> 01:08:33.505
I couldn't even afford a phone.

01:08:33.506 --> 01:08:35.843
So, you know, I gave him up.

01:08:36.977 --> 01:08:38.710
I felt so damned
guilty about it,

01:08:38.712 --> 01:08:41.883
I vowed never to
give up a baby again.

01:08:43.015 --> 01:08:45.987
You can see how well
that turned out.

01:08:47.187 --> 01:08:50.755
I'm sorry, I can't imagine
how hard it would be to

01:08:50.756 --> 01:08:52.993
raise all those kids alone.

01:08:54.229 --> 01:08:56.127
Oh, well, at least he's old
enough to get a work permit.

01:08:56.129 --> 01:08:59.197
If nothing else, he'll be
another source of income.

01:08:59.198 --> 01:09:02.734
Listen, I fully intend to
contribute to his well-being so.

01:09:02.736 --> 01:09:05.970
Yeah, oh, yeah, you
will be doing that, too.

01:09:05.973 --> 01:09:07.572
I'm sure you can afford it

01:09:07.573 --> 01:09:11.176
being you're the famous
kid-hater and all that.

01:09:11.178 --> 01:09:13.813
You should follow
me around for a day.

01:09:13.814 --> 01:09:16.118
You'd get some great material.

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:17.984
Seriously.

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:25.992
All right, I'm curious.

01:09:25.993 --> 01:09:28.126
What are your reasons
this time around?

01:09:28.127 --> 01:09:32.063
Well, for one thing, I'm
getting married on Sunday.

01:09:32.064 --> 01:09:34.200
Congratulations.

01:09:34.202 --> 01:09:35.635
Let me guess.

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.169
She's a total peach
with a rocking body

01:09:37.171 --> 01:09:40.139
and a personality so
sunny she blooms daffodils

01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:41.741
right outta her ass.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:42.577
Hey.

01:09:45.578 --> 01:09:48.850
She doesn't know
about him, does she?

01:09:54.556 --> 01:09:55.757
That's rich, man.

01:09:58.126 --> 01:09:59.858
Nothing like starting
a lifelong commitment

01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:01.696
with a big fat secret.

01:10:06.700 --> 01:10:08.870
Good luck with that, Nick.

01:10:10.305 --> 01:10:14.307
Mom, Lenny and Johnny are
tattooing the baby again!

01:10:14.309 --> 01:10:15.640
Oh, for Christ sake!

01:10:15.642 --> 01:10:17.343
You little monsters!

01:10:17.345 --> 01:10:21.279
What have I told you about
drawing on the baby, huh?

01:10:21.281 --> 01:10:23.316
This is permanent marker!

01:10:23.318 --> 01:10:25.587
What is wrong with you two?

01:10:29.324 --> 01:10:32.094
Everybody go to bed right now!

01:10:37.598 --> 01:10:38.363
Well, that's another two weeks

01:10:38.365 --> 01:10:40.099
I can't take her out in public.

01:10:40.101 --> 01:10:41.834
I know, I know, honey.

01:10:41.836 --> 01:10:44.737
Frankie, go get the air
mattress out of the shed.

01:10:44.739 --> 01:10:45.938
I'm putting Mason
in with you three.

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:47.005
Oh, come on!

01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:47.974
There no room in there as it...

01:10:47.976 --> 01:10:50.276
Hey, do not back talk me.

01:10:50.278 --> 01:10:53.748
It's fine, I'll just
sleep on the couch.

01:10:55.048 --> 01:10:56.081
Well, thank you, Mason.

01:10:56.083 --> 01:10:57.617
That's very helpful.

01:10:57.619 --> 01:10:58.350
I gotta go clean her up.

01:10:58.352 --> 01:11:00.721
Say goodbye to your father.

01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:10.328
I'd just
like to say thank you.

01:11:10.330 --> 01:11:11.997
For what?

01:11:11.999 --> 01:11:15.701
For keeping your promise
and helping me find my mother.

01:11:15.703 --> 01:11:17.138
You're welcome.

01:11:18.338 --> 01:11:19.574
Listen.

01:11:21.909 --> 01:11:24.212
Is there anything you need or,

01:11:26.047 --> 01:11:27.013
anything I can...

01:11:27.015 --> 01:11:28.584
No, I'll be fine.

01:11:29.984 --> 01:11:32.318
I told you, all I wanted
from you was this one thing

01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.885
and you did it.

01:11:33.887 --> 01:11:36.824
Now you can go off
and get married.

01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:40.259
Yeah, well, that seems kinda
questionable at this point.

01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:41.661
Why?

01:11:41.663 --> 01:11:42.894
I thought once I
was out of the way,

01:11:42.896 --> 01:11:44.663
you'd be free to get married.

01:11:44.665 --> 01:11:46.264
Well, it seemed
that way last night

01:11:46.266 --> 01:11:50.037
but this has been a very,
very, very long day.

01:11:52.440 --> 01:11:53.272
Are you all right?

01:11:53.274 --> 01:11:54.843
What are you doing?

01:11:56.244 --> 01:11:58.044
I'm calling on my
own psychic powers

01:11:58.046 --> 01:12:00.248
to see how things turn out.

01:12:03.985 --> 01:12:05.417
Well?

01:12:05.419 --> 01:12:06.622
Well what?

01:12:07.623 --> 01:12:10.423
Well, aren't you gonna
tell me what's in store?

01:12:10.425 --> 01:12:11.389
Heck, no.

01:12:11.391 --> 01:12:13.160
That'd be cheating.

01:12:14.227 --> 01:12:15.663
What a rip-off.

01:12:57.504 --> 01:12:58.470
Well, I mean, this seemed like

01:12:58.472 --> 01:13:00.371
the perfect moment to say it.

01:13:00.373 --> 01:13:01.976
You're my father.

01:13:07.981 --> 01:13:10.349
Is there any way I could take
a piece of that for the road?

01:13:11.985 --> 01:13:13.318
When was the last time
you had your radar gun

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.487
calibrated for accuracy?

01:13:15.489 --> 01:13:16.622
Are you a ninja?

01:13:16.624 --> 01:13:20.192
I knew I had met the man
of my dreams when he spoke

01:13:20.194 --> 01:13:24.031
these three precious
words to me, I hate kids.

01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.268
So, what is that thing anyway?

01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:30.803
It's a fidget spinner.

01:13:30.805 --> 01:13:32.071
It helps keep me calm.

01:13:32.073 --> 01:13:33.005
Oh, yeah?

01:13:33.007 --> 01:13:35.077
I could use one of those.

01:14:02.136 --> 01:14:03.434
Hi.

01:14:03.436 --> 01:14:04.472
Hi.

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:14.246
Thanks for coming by.

01:14:14.248 --> 01:14:18.050
It was at the top of
my to-do list today.

01:14:18.052 --> 01:14:21.123
How was the lecture
in Santa Barbara?

01:14:25.092 --> 01:14:27.126
There was no lecture.

01:14:27.128 --> 01:14:28.560
I know.

01:14:28.562 --> 01:14:29.429
We need to have a serious...

01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:31.831
I'm calling off
the wedding, Nick.

01:14:31.833 --> 01:14:32.665
That's what I was gonna do.

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:35.099
Well, it's too
late, I just did it.

01:14:35.101 --> 01:14:36.434
Yeah, I heard that.

01:14:36.436 --> 01:14:37.670
Why were you
gonna call it off?

01:14:37.672 --> 01:14:40.505
Oh, no, you called it off
first, you gotta say why first.

01:14:40.507 --> 01:14:43.075
Well, I first considered it

01:14:43.077 --> 01:14:44.910
when I found out
there wasn't a lecture

01:14:44.912 --> 01:14:47.315
in Santa Barbara or wherever.

01:14:48.248 --> 01:14:49.081
That's what did it?

01:14:49.083 --> 01:14:50.482
No.

01:14:50.484 --> 01:14:52.518
And then I found this
giant box of girlfriends

01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.586
which was horrifying.

01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:57.255
How did you ever find
time to write a book?

01:14:57.257 --> 01:14:58.590
So that's why
you're calling it off?

01:14:58.592 --> 01:14:59.425
No.

01:14:59.427 --> 01:15:00.492
No?

01:15:00.494 --> 01:15:02.594
It wasn't your
lying in the present

01:15:02.596 --> 01:15:06.497
and it wasn't my
trolling around the past.

01:15:06.499 --> 01:15:08.537
It's about the future.

01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:11.336
You don't want to marry me

01:15:11.338 --> 01:15:12.604
because of something
I haven't done yet?

01:15:12.606 --> 01:15:14.639
It's not about you, Nick.

01:15:14.641 --> 01:15:16.207
It's about me.

01:15:16.209 --> 01:15:17.443
You don't want to marry me

01:15:17.445 --> 01:15:20.549
because of something
you haven't done yet?

01:15:22.115 --> 01:15:24.019
I've changed my mind.

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:27.823
I wanna have a family.

01:15:28.890 --> 01:15:29.891
I want kids.

01:15:33.494 --> 01:15:34.893
Nick.

01:15:34.895 --> 01:15:37.563
You need to trust me, Sydney.

01:15:37.565 --> 01:15:42.201
I've loved you since the
first time I saw you.

01:15:42.203 --> 01:15:45.603
I love you with every
molecule of my being.

01:15:45.605 --> 01:15:48.510
I don't wanna be
without you, ever.

01:15:50.311 --> 01:15:52.210
You believe that, right?

01:15:52.212 --> 01:15:53.912
Yes.

01:15:53.914 --> 01:15:56.081
Then come with me.

01:15:56.083 --> 01:15:57.619
Where are we going?

01:15:58.686 --> 01:16:01.319
I can't undo
everything in my past

01:16:01.321 --> 01:16:03.421
but there is one thing
that I can change.

01:16:03.423 --> 01:16:04.258
Come on.

01:16:23.476 --> 01:16:25.544
I'm gonna
get you, Johnny!

01:16:25.546 --> 01:16:26.481
Hey, hey!

01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.122
Hello, Nick.

01:16:40.226 --> 01:16:41.960
This must be daffodil.

01:16:41.962 --> 01:16:43.163
Hi, I'm Sydney.

01:16:44.699 --> 01:16:46.197
Please.

01:16:46.199 --> 01:16:47.599
You forget something?

01:16:47.601 --> 01:16:50.202
I want Mason back.

01:16:50.204 --> 01:16:52.537
Really, what happened?

01:16:52.539 --> 01:16:55.541
You feel guilty for a change?

01:16:55.543 --> 01:16:57.445
What's it like for you?

01:16:58.678 --> 01:16:59.978
Just get him.

01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:02.715
Oh, I would love
to but he's gone.

01:17:02.717 --> 01:17:03.648
Gone?

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:05.384
What do you mean he's gone?

01:17:05.386 --> 01:17:06.417
He snuck out in the
middle of the night.

01:17:06.419 --> 01:17:07.618
Just up and left.

01:17:07.620 --> 01:17:11.357
Not a goodbye, not a good
luck, not even a good riddance.

01:17:11.359 --> 01:17:12.558
Congratulations, Nick,

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.727
he turned out to be
just like you after all.

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:16.761
Well, don't you have
any idea where he is?

01:17:16.763 --> 01:17:18.967
What do I look
like a mind reader?

01:17:22.602 --> 01:17:24.702
I'm getting an A.

01:17:24.704 --> 01:17:26.140
A really big A.

01:17:29.243 --> 01:17:30.078
Nick?

01:17:36.717 --> 01:17:39.350
I know how to find him.

01:17:39.352 --> 01:17:42.453
We, the gifted, face
insurmountable odds

01:17:42.455 --> 01:17:44.756
in a world that continues
to lean in favor

01:17:44.758 --> 01:17:47.494
of dark skepticism
and disbelief.

01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:51.796
For centuries, we were
heralded and praised,

01:17:51.798 --> 01:17:55.033
even worshipped
for our abilities.

01:17:55.035 --> 01:17:57.402
But in these troubled
times, when what we provide

01:17:57.404 --> 01:17:59.571
comfort and hope
are needed the most,

01:17:59.573 --> 01:18:02.741
we are shunned,
vilified, even hunted

01:18:02.743 --> 01:18:07.246
by those who cannot see
past their own fears.

01:18:07.248 --> 01:18:10.049
We all know that when
things become their worst,

01:18:10.051 --> 01:18:12.317
when what is desperately
sought cannot be found

01:18:12.319 --> 01:18:16.487
by traditional means, that is
when skeptics bow their heads

01:18:16.489 --> 01:18:19.426
and concede to
their lack of sight.

01:18:20.628 --> 01:18:21.696
How delightful!

01:18:24.065 --> 01:18:27.066
I just love the smell of
humble pie, don't you?

01:18:28.769 --> 01:18:30.234
At this time, Mr. Sparkles and I

01:18:30.236 --> 01:18:31.769
will be entertaining
your questions.

01:18:31.771 --> 01:18:35.773
Just step right up to
the mic and ask away.

01:18:35.775 --> 01:18:38.109
Go on, don't be skittish.

01:18:38.111 --> 01:18:38.747
Anyone?

01:18:39.779 --> 01:18:42.346
No one have, of course.

01:18:42.348 --> 01:18:43.816
If you are as gifted as I am,

01:18:43.818 --> 01:18:47.219
you already know the
answers, don't you?

01:18:47.221 --> 01:18:48.519
Well, let's saunter
over to the pool

01:18:48.521 --> 01:18:50.456
for the pyrokinetic
meet and greet.

01:18:50.458 --> 01:18:51.689
In response to last
year's faux pas,

01:18:51.691 --> 01:18:53.425
I'm told there's much
more fire extinguishers

01:18:53.427 --> 01:18:55.030
this time around.

01:18:56.129 --> 01:18:57.798
I have a question.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.300
Isn't it true that
you're a fraud?

01:19:02.302 --> 01:19:03.535
I beg your pardon?

01:19:03.537 --> 01:19:05.470
Didn't you admit
to me just yesterday

01:19:05.472 --> 01:19:09.640
that your entire career was
forged from being an imposter?

01:19:09.642 --> 01:19:10.742
Guards, will you
escort this barbarian

01:19:10.744 --> 01:19:12.643
off the premises, please?

01:19:12.645 --> 01:19:13.478
What are you doing?

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:14.412
All right then...

01:19:14.414 --> 01:19:16.115
Sir, you need to come with us.

01:19:16.117 --> 01:19:17.215
All right, I challenge you
in front of all your peers

01:19:17.217 --> 01:19:20.685
to prove that you
are not a fake!

01:19:20.687 --> 01:19:22.487
How do you suppose I do that?

01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:23.657
Find my son.

01:19:25.258 --> 01:19:26.492
Right now.

01:19:26.494 --> 01:19:29.731
You found me for him,
now find him for me.

01:19:30.698 --> 01:19:33.535
I want him in my life.

01:19:34.869 --> 01:19:36.434
Just do it.

01:19:36.436 --> 01:19:38.836
Do it, Fabular, come on.

01:19:38.838 --> 01:19:41.740
I got $500 here
for the first psychic

01:19:41.742 --> 01:19:43.908
that can find my son.

01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:45.844
He's on a train to Istanbul!

01:19:45.846 --> 01:19:48.846
He's at Delray
Beach, tower 22!

01:19:48.848 --> 01:19:51.617
He's fishing in Lake
Charles, Louisiana!

01:19:51.619 --> 01:19:54.819
He is in San Francisco at
the opening of the opera.

01:19:54.821 --> 01:19:55.655
Wait!

01:19:56.824 --> 01:20:02.196
He's in Pismo Beach
at Melvin's house!

01:20:06.566 --> 01:20:08.267
Do you actually need to be
a psychic to take a guess?

01:20:14.941 --> 01:20:16.144
He's here.

01:20:20.847 --> 01:20:22.649
Hi, Nick.

01:20:28.489 --> 01:20:29.324
Hi, son.

01:20:35.262 --> 01:20:36.698
Aw.

01:20:43.204 --> 01:20:46.938
Hey, Mason, why
would you run away?

01:20:46.940 --> 01:20:50.576
I came to ask Fabular
if I could live with him.

01:20:50.578 --> 01:20:51.876
I don't wanna live
with my mother.

01:20:51.878 --> 01:20:53.778
She isn't very nice.

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:57.381
No, I think she's
just not happy right now

01:20:57.383 --> 01:20:58.349
but I think there's
something we can do

01:20:58.351 --> 01:20:59.854
to maybe change that.

01:21:01.254 --> 01:21:03.487
Hi, I'm Sydney.

01:21:03.489 --> 01:21:05.691
It's nice to
officially meet you.

01:21:05.693 --> 01:21:07.459
It's nice to meet you, Sydney.

01:21:07.461 --> 01:21:09.928
Nick talks about
you all the time.

01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.997
He is definitely yours.

01:21:12.999 --> 01:21:15.000
Hey, Fabular!

01:21:15.002 --> 01:21:17.868
You said on the radio that
Petey was on his way home to me!

01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:19.470
But he was already dead!

01:21:19.472 --> 01:21:20.973
You lied, you bastard!

01:21:20.975 --> 01:21:23.242
This is for Petey!

01:21:29.917 --> 01:21:30.952
Whoa!

01:21:31.985 --> 01:21:32.819
Damn it!

01:21:34.954 --> 01:21:36.925
Whoa, are you okay?

01:21:40.526 --> 01:21:41.529
Scarecrow!

01:21:42.829 --> 01:21:43.664
Tin Man!

01:21:45.365 --> 01:21:45.966
My lion!

01:21:49.503 --> 01:21:51.469
Thank you, Ernie.

01:21:51.471 --> 01:21:52.706
I'll take my.

01:22:04.284 --> 01:22:06.617
Is there anyone here
today who knows of a reason

01:22:06.619 --> 01:22:11.225
why these two should not be
joined in holy matrimony?

01:22:14.962 --> 01:22:16.928
Good, ladies and gentlemen,

01:22:16.930 --> 01:22:18.697
it gives me great pleasure
to introduce to you

01:22:18.699 --> 01:22:21.700
Mr. and Mrs. Nicholas Pearson.

01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:24.935
Kiss the bride.

01:22:33.747 --> 01:22:37.049
DC THE BRAIN
SUPREME: Party people!

01:22:37.051 --> 01:22:40.254
Yeah, Tag Team music
in full effect!

01:22:41.587 --> 01:22:46.425
That's me, DC the Brain Supreme
and my man Steve Roll'n!

01:23:11.851 --> 01:23:13.053
Hey, hey, hey!

01:23:13.986 --> 01:23:15.086
Hey!

01:23:15.088 --> 01:23:17.022
Excuse me.

01:23:17.024 --> 01:23:19.090
Is this one of yours?

01:23:19.092 --> 01:23:20.694
Yep, afraid so.

01:23:22.462 --> 01:23:23.463
Here you go.

01:23:24.698 --> 01:23:28.133
Wow, your husband's a lucky man.

01:23:28.135 --> 01:23:30.035
I want that one.

01:23:30.037 --> 01:23:31.702
I love kids.

01:23:31.704 --> 01:23:34.975
Oh, there is no husband.

01:23:36.043 --> 01:23:37.312
It's just me.

01:23:39.145 --> 01:23:40.814
My name is Walter.

01:23:41.882 --> 01:23:43.014
Joanna.

01:23:43.016 --> 01:23:44.148
Joanna?

01:23:44.150 --> 01:23:45.550
Yeah.

01:23:45.552 --> 01:23:47.018
That's a beautiful name.

01:25:47.807 --> 01:25:50.175
Yeah, Tag Team music

01:25:50.177 --> 01:25:52.877

01:25:52.879 --> 01:25:57.885
That's me, DC the Brain Supreme,
and my man Steve Roll'n!

01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:00.218
Bring it back y'all,

01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.853

and here we go!

01:26:21.173 --> 01:26:22.206
