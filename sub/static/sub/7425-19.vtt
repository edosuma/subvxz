CATHERINE:
<i>Ray Sheckman.</i>

00:06.383 --> 00:07.816
He had a gun
and he was gonna shoot Heather.

Vincent Keller.

I used to be what he is;

00:15.158 --> 00:17.359
he is a beast
and he always will be.

00:17.394 --> 00:19.862
You ratted me out, didn't you? (grunts)
- Yeah.

00:19.896 --> 00:21.296
Cat, how far are you
willing to go with this?

00:21.330 --> 00:22.698
I'm not gonna let Vincent
get caught.

- What... but I...

02:05.465 --> 02:06.565

02:26.652 --> 02:28.119
I know.
And I'm sorry,

02:28.153 --> 02:29.587
but the police are tailing me
to get to you.

02:29.622 --> 02:30.955
Well, don't get caught,

02:30.990 --> 02:32.657
I don't want you
to get in trouble, too.

02:32.691 --> 02:35.326
I'm already in trouble--
I'm in love with a fugitive.

02:35.360 --> 02:36.460
I didn't do it.

02:36.495 --> 02:37.929
That's what they all say.

02:42.100 --> 02:43.067
Okay, I have to go.

02:43.101 --> 02:44.568
What? That's my line.

02:44.602 --> 02:46.337
I know, but Heather's here
and I need to get back

02:46.371 --> 02:48.639
before she gets suspicious
and my tail catches up.

02:48.673 --> 02:51.142
Whoa, hold up, Heather is here
right now, downstairs?

02:51.176 --> 02:52.510
Yeah, surprise.

02:52.544 --> 02:53.911
Wow, it really is
like old times:

02:53.945 --> 02:56.580
Me hiding in shadows,
you hiding me.

02:56.614 --> 02:58.782
Yeah, and me lying to my sister,
Tess covering for me.

02:58.816 --> 02:59.917
I am so sick of lying.

02:59.951 --> 03:01.852
I thought we were
moving past all this.

03:01.886 --> 03:03.620
We will, somehow.

03:03.655 --> 03:05.856
Yeah, only if Agent Knox
gets the exoneration

03:05.890 --> 03:07.157
before the police catch you.

03:07.191 --> 03:08.625
Yeah, or Gabe does.

03:08.660 --> 03:10.427
(helicopter blades whirring)

03:10.461 --> 03:12.596
Okay, here. Take this,
get rid of the other one

03:12.630 --> 03:14.031
in case they're tracking you.

03:14.065 --> 03:16.199
Okay, thanks. Pavilion?

03:16.233 --> 03:17.867
Yeah. Don't be late.
- I won't.

03:17.901 --> 03:19.402
Wait, your bag!

03:21.539 --> 03:23.700
The mayor has increased
police presence... (door opens)

03:23.707 --> 03:25.608
They were still damp
(sighs) so... Shh.

03:25.642 --> 03:27.377
...in case the fugitive
attempts to leave Manhattan.

03:27.411 --> 03:29.345
Vincent Keller
has been on the run

03:29.380 --> 03:30.813

03:30.847 --> 03:31.847
We'll have the full de...

03:31.882 --> 03:33.483
(TV clicks off)
- Wha...

03:33.517 --> 03:34.617
Hey, I was watching that.

03:34.651 --> 03:36.652
Yeah, but...
I want to hear your news.

03:36.687 --> 03:39.221
Yeah, but they were talking
about that doctor,

03:39.255 --> 03:40.456
the guy that you dated
last year, right,

03:40.490 --> 03:41.523
they said that
he murdered someone.

03:41.558 --> 03:44.293
He didn't murder...
(laughs)

03:44.327 --> 03:45.995
I mean, who knows, right?

03:46.029 --> 03:48.731
He's innocent
until proven guilty.

03:48.765 --> 03:50.665
Yeah, but you don't
break out of prison

03:50.700 --> 03:52.033
if you're innocent.
Come on, Cat.

03:53.936 --> 03:55.237
But you stopped seeing him,
didn't you?

03:55.271 --> 03:56.905
Yes.

03:56.939 --> 03:58.240
Yes, of course

03:58.274 --> 04:00.008
(laughs)
I did. A long time ago.

04:00.042 --> 04:02.544
(sighs) Anyway,
what's going on with you?

04:02.579 --> 04:03.912
What's your news?

04:03.946 --> 04:06.047
Okay.
(gasps)

04:06.082 --> 04:08.416
So, I'm in Miami, right?
- (laughs)

"Uh-oh," what?

04:14.289 --> 04:15.857

04:15.891 --> 04:17.558
I have to go,
it's an emergency.

04:17.593 --> 04:18.593
What?

04:18.628 --> 04:20.928

Heather, I'm sorry, I am.

04:20.963 --> 04:22.443
I-I just don't
want to rush you and...

04:24.299 --> 04:27.735
Look, I know that I don't really
seem to make time for you

04:27.769 --> 04:29.770
and that has to change.

04:29.804 --> 04:32.373
But right now,
I really do have to go, okay?

04:32.407 --> 04:34.775
Okay.

04:34.809 --> 04:36.410
Thank you for being so
understanding.

he's doing anything he can

06:27.278 --> 06:29.579
Well, that's a new low,

06:29.614 --> 06:32.081

You know, everyone thinks
the guy's some paragon of good,

if they only knew

06:35.986 --> 06:37.621
who he used to be.

06:37.655 --> 06:39.489
Well, maybe it's time
they found out.

06:39.524 --> 06:41.791
Maybe it's time that we dig up
something from Gabe's past

06:41.825 --> 06:43.126
and put him
on the defensive for once.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.295
Something, like what?
I don't know.

06:45.329 --> 06:47.330
But he's done plenty
of awful things as a beast.

06:47.364 --> 06:49.265
Things that he's
conveniently forgotten.

06:49.300 --> 06:50.866
Maybe it's time to remind him.

06:50.901 --> 06:52.601
Yeah, make him focus on
chasing his own tail,

06:52.636 --> 06:54.437
instead of chasing mine,
for once.

06:54.471 --> 06:56.339
It's worth a shot, especially
since Gabe's the only thing

06:56.373 --> 06:57.773
keeping you
from being exonerated.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.775
(phone beeping)

06:59.810 --> 07:01.710

Okay. Go talk to her.

07:01.745 --> 07:03.378
Yeah and say (laughs) what,

07:03.413 --> 07:05.781
that-that I'm in love with
an escaped fugitive beast?

07:05.816 --> 07:08.350
Well, maybe start
with the fugitive part

07:08.384 --> 07:10.385
and then...
see how things go from there.

07:10.420 --> 07:12.054
(sighs)

07:12.088 --> 07:13.355
I'm gonna get Tess
to talk to her,

07:13.389 --> 07:15.157
buy us some time.

07:15.191 --> 07:16.558
So, that we can figure out

07:16.592 --> 07:18.493
how to turn the tables on Gabe.

07:18.527 --> 07:20.262
Okay.

07:27.236 --> 07:29.338
I can't believe
you lost her again.

07:29.372 --> 07:30.572
Well, it's not that easy.

07:30.606 --> 07:32.073
She knows
we're tailing her now.

07:32.107 --> 07:33.347
Well, put more
resources on her.

07:33.375 --> 07:34.676
I am telling you,

07:34.710 --> 07:35.677
our best chance
of finding Keller,

07:35.711 --> 07:37.144
is to follow Catherine.

07:37.179 --> 07:38.847
Catherine?

07:38.881 --> 07:41.148
Uh...
just out of curiosity,

07:41.183 --> 07:43.551
what'd she mean when she said
you were trying to railroad her?

07:43.586 --> 07:44.652
None of your business.

07:44.687 --> 07:45.820
Listen, Lowan,

07:45.855 --> 07:47.221
if this is personal
between you two,

07:47.255 --> 07:48.722
I need to know, because...

07:48.756 --> 07:50.891
Look, this is about
catching a suspected killer,

07:50.925 --> 07:52.559
plain and simple.
And I am telling you,

07:52.594 --> 07:54.314
Detective Chandler
is the key to doing that.

07:57.032 --> 07:58.565
Which is why,

07:58.600 --> 08:00.601
we need to
turn the focus onto her.

08:00.635 --> 08:02.003
Bug her phone, her apartment.

08:02.037 --> 08:03.704
Put a transponder
on her car.

08:03.738 --> 08:05.038
We can't do that
without a court order.

08:05.072 --> 08:06.206
I will get the order,

08:06.240 --> 08:07.440
you just find her.

08:07.475 --> 08:09.242
Gabe.

08:09.276 --> 08:11.044
(laughs):
Hi.

08:11.078 --> 08:14.447
(whispering): Look, make no
mistake about it, Captain,

08:14.482 --> 08:15.849
we are tightening the noose

08:15.884 --> 08:17.350
on Detective Chandler,
understood?

08:17.385 --> 08:18.451
For her sake...

08:18.486 --> 08:21.254
and for everyone else's.

08:21.288 --> 08:24.524
Heather, (laughs)
I didn't know you were in town.

08:24.558 --> 08:26.259
Yeah. Just a couple of days.

08:26.293 --> 08:27.293
Uh, is Cat around?

08:27.328 --> 08:28.561
Uh, no, she's not.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.263
Figures. (sighs)
She's always at work,

08:30.297 --> 08:32.432
except for the one time
I decide to stop by. (laughs)

08:32.466 --> 08:33.599
You got engaged.

08:33.634 --> 08:35.268
Yeah...
(laughs)

08:36.636 --> 08:38.070
Actually, that's why I'm here.

08:38.104 --> 08:39.938
I-I was hoping Cat could help me
pick out my wedding dress

08:39.972 --> 08:42.542
at Selena's, but I
can't even get ahold of her

08:42.576 --> 08:43.708
long enough to ask.

08:43.744 --> 08:44.911
Any idea when she'll be back?

08:44.945 --> 08:46.278
Actually...

08:46.312 --> 08:47.914
I'm not expecting her back
for a while.

08:47.948 --> 08:49.381
Um...

08:49.416 --> 08:51.116
(sighs)

08:51.151 --> 08:53.318
Heather,
Catherine's been suspended.

08:53.353 --> 08:54.986
What? Why?

08:55.021 --> 08:57.322
It's complicated. Um...

08:57.357 --> 09:00.225
But I don't understand,
what did she do?

09:00.260 --> 09:02.494
I'm not at liberty
to discuss that.

09:02.529 --> 09:04.449
Besides, I really think
that's her story to tell.

09:04.464 --> 09:05.797
Well, Cat doesn't
tell me anything...

09:05.831 --> 09:08.400
ever, so I might as well
hear it from you.

09:08.435 --> 09:10.435
It... shouldn't come from me,
I'm sorry.

09:10.469 --> 09:11.436
But, uh, hey,

09:11.470 --> 09:13.171
will you give me a call
if you find her?

09:13.205 --> 09:15.239
I'd really like to make sure
she's okay.

09:15.274 --> 09:16.474
Sure.

09:16.508 --> 09:17.676
It was good to see you.

09:17.710 --> 09:19.277
You, too.

09:20.813 --> 09:22.847
CATHERINE:
<i>Hey, where are you?</i>

09:22.882 --> 09:24.182
Can you talk?

09:24.216 --> 09:26.684
Uh... yes, I can,
I'm at JT's.

09:26.718 --> 09:27.918
Wait, is that safe?

09:27.953 --> 09:29.187
Well, define safe.

09:29.221 --> 09:31.189
No, it's good.
JT's gone to Boston,

09:31.223 --> 09:34.158
so, the cops have pulled
the stake-out from his place.

09:34.193 --> 09:36.273
Probably to put more
surveillance on you, I'm afraid.

09:36.295 --> 09:37.928
Yeah.

09:37.963 --> 09:40.264
Okay, so can you still
get into this database?

09:40.299 --> 09:42.099
Yeah. I guess it hasn't
filtered down to HR

09:42.133 --> 09:43.601
that I've been suspended yet.

09:43.635 --> 09:44.768
Okay, well,
we better move fast then.

09:44.803 --> 09:46.269
So, what are we
looking for exactly?

09:46.304 --> 09:49.473
Any unsolved crimes from around
the time that we first met Gabe.

09:49.507 --> 09:51.041
Catherine, we're talking about

09:51.076 --> 09:52.275
a city of 8,000,000 people here.

09:52.310 --> 09:54.011
We got to
narrow it down somehow.

09:54.045 --> 09:56.013
That's why I think we need to
focus on unsolved murders,

09:56.047 --> 09:58.982
especially ones that were
blamed on the vigilante-- you.

09:59.016 --> 10:01.818
You mean, the ones that Gabe
tried to frame me for.

10:01.852 --> 10:03.453
Yeah, there must be a way
to link him to one of them...

10:03.488 --> 10:04.654
especially 'cause he was

10:04.688 --> 10:05.722
the lead investigator
at the time.

10:05.756 --> 10:06.990
(mouse clicking)

10:07.024 --> 10:08.225
Here's one:

10:08.259 --> 10:10.693
Leonard Adelson,
do you remember him?

10:10.728 --> 10:12.695
Adelson, Adelson.

10:12.730 --> 10:14.197
Yeah, he was
the carriage driver

10:14.232 --> 10:15.564
that someone tried
to make look like a...

10:15.599 --> 10:17.533
A beast killing.

10:20.337 --> 10:21.638
So, it must've been Gabe, right?

10:21.672 --> 10:22.905
He was the only other beast

10:22.940 --> 10:24.306
we knew of at the time.

10:24.341 --> 10:25.908
Yeah, except, we can't place him

10:25.943 --> 10:27.623
at the scene of the crime,
he has an alibi.

10:29.013 --> 10:31.580
Um... but we can
put him at the museum

10:31.615 --> 10:33.382
where Ray Sheckman
was found dead.

10:33.416 --> 10:36.252
Sheckman? You mean the guy that
tried to have Heather killed?

10:36.286 --> 10:38.554
Yeah, exactly. And then he tried
to blame it on the vigilante,

10:38.588 --> 10:40.422
even though
you ended up saving her.

10:40.457 --> 10:42.224
No suspects,

10:42.259 --> 10:44.393
no witnesses,
no investigation.

10:44.427 --> 10:46.362
And no articles
on the murder, either.

10:46.396 --> 10:47.929
That's because the DA's office

10:47.964 --> 10:49.665
apparently terminated
the investigation,

10:49.699 --> 10:51.332
citing insufficient evidence.

10:51.367 --> 10:53.434
(scoffs)

10:53.469 --> 10:56.337
And guess who the ADA was
who terminated it?

10:56.372 --> 10:58.506
Gabe.
(sighs)

10:58.541 --> 10:59.908
Which means...

10:59.942 --> 11:02.410
if we can prove
that Gabe killed Ray...

11:02.444 --> 11:03.812
We can have a future.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.281
Oh, no.

11:06.315 --> 11:07.415
What?

11:07.449 --> 11:08.683
They shut me down.

11:08.717 --> 11:09.684
What? What do you mean?

11:09.718 --> 11:10.785
What does, what does that mean?

11:10.819 --> 11:12.587
That means we're running
out of time.

11:14.657 --> 11:16.757
(cell phone ringing)

11:19.662 --> 11:21.361
Did you locate Chandler?

11:21.396 --> 11:24.298
No, but I know she's
on a computer somewhere.

11:24.332 --> 11:25.900
Or was.
Talk to me.

11:25.934 --> 11:27.301
Well, I've had I.T. working on

11:27.335 --> 11:28.635
shutting down both Chandler's

11:28.670 --> 11:29.770
and Vargas' access,

11:29.805 --> 11:31.105
and they were finally
able to do it.

11:31.139 --> 11:32.272
But?

11:32.307 --> 11:33.640
But they found out

11:33.675 --> 11:35.076
that Chandler was checking
into a cold case

11:35.110 --> 11:36.643
just before they shut her down.

11:36.678 --> 11:37.711
What cold case?

11:37.745 --> 11:39.479
About a year ago.

11:39.514 --> 11:41.748
An unsolved murder,
a Ray Sheckman.

11:41.782 --> 11:42.849
Ring any bells?

11:44.519 --> 11:46.653
Gabe Lowan,
Assistant District Attorney.

11:46.688 --> 11:47.954
You're Ray Sheckman, right?

11:47.988 --> 11:49.223
WARD:
<i>What do you think it means?</i>

11:49.257 --> 11:51.758
It means

11:51.792 --> 11:53.327
they're desperate.

11:53.361 --> 11:55.695
I'll call you back.

12:02.216 --> 12:03.953
If Gabe squashed
the investigation

12:03.954 --> 12:05.788
it can only be for one reason.

12:05.822 --> 12:07.323
Yeah, because he
killed Ray Sheckman.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.058
He wanted to keep
the vigilante on the run,

12:09.092 --> 12:10.933
he doesn't want you exonerated.
Sound familiar?

12:10.961 --> 12:13.062
Well, he's consistent,
I'll give him that.

12:13.096 --> 12:14.496
I don't know, I think
I liked the guy better

12:14.531 --> 12:15.831
when he was a beast.

12:15.866 --> 12:16.966
At least then he was only trying

12:17.000 --> 12:18.167
to destroy me to survive.

12:18.201 --> 12:19.268
And now he's trying
to destroy you

12:19.302 --> 12:20.582
because you're sleeping with me.

12:20.603 --> 12:21.804
All right, Detective,

12:21.838 --> 12:23.172
how do we prove
that he killed Sheckman?

12:23.206 --> 12:24.673
Where do we start?

12:24.707 --> 12:26.074
We start the same way
you start every investigation.

12:26.108 --> 12:27.742
Even cold cases.

12:27.777 --> 12:29.478
The crime scene.

12:29.512 --> 12:31.446
(indistinct chatter)

12:33.383 --> 12:35.016
(door opens, bell jingles)

12:35.051 --> 12:37.018
Heather.
- Tess!

12:37.053 --> 12:38.853
Hi! Look at you.
- Hi!

12:38.888 --> 12:40.422
You look amazing.

12:40.456 --> 12:42.691
Miami obviously
agrees with you.

12:42.725 --> 12:44.325
Yeah, I love it there.

12:44.359 --> 12:46.995
And I don't miss the cold,
that's for sure.

12:47.029 --> 12:48.697
Just Cat.

12:48.731 --> 12:50.098
Who doesn't seem
to have time for me,

12:50.132 --> 12:51.332
so she sends you.

12:51.366 --> 12:53.168
Look, Heather I'm sor...

12:53.202 --> 12:54.535
Tess, don't get me wrong.

12:54.570 --> 12:56.470
I'm thrilled to
see you. I am.

12:56.505 --> 12:59.373
I just don't know
why Cat keeps avoiding me.

12:59.408 --> 13:01.375
So what else is new, right?

13:01.410 --> 13:03.110
No, Cat's not avoiding you,
Heather.

13:03.144 --> 13:04.278
Sh...

13:04.313 --> 13:05.846
All right, maybe a little bit.

13:05.880 --> 13:08.216
But I promise that it's
not because of you.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.118
She's just got a lot
on her plate right now.

13:11.152 --> 13:12.786
Like what, police cases?

13:12.821 --> 13:14.521
Yeah, you know, cases. Totally.

13:14.555 --> 13:16.523
(laughs)

13:16.557 --> 13:18.959
What?

13:18.993 --> 13:20.393
You want to know
what I love about Miami

13:20.428 --> 13:21.795
more than anything?

13:21.830 --> 13:23.396
All of my new friends,
the people I work with,

13:23.431 --> 13:24.564
my fiancé.

13:24.599 --> 13:27.300
"Fiancé"?
Yeah, my fiancé.

13:27.335 --> 13:28.468
Oh.
(chuckles)

13:28.502 --> 13:29.903
Nobody lies to me there.

13:29.938 --> 13:31.638
We're all honest
with each other.

13:31.672 --> 13:33.373
It's refreshing.

13:33.407 --> 13:36.209
Cat doesn't
have any cases.

13:36.244 --> 13:37.577
She was suspended.

13:37.612 --> 13:39.412
I stopped by the precinct
looking for her.

13:39.447 --> 13:43.149
I'm not her flaky little
sister anymore, Tess, okay?

13:43.183 --> 13:45.151
I'm a grown woman,
I've got a life of my own.

13:45.185 --> 13:46.253
I don't need to be protected

13:46.287 --> 13:47.519
from the truth, I-I need

13:47.554 --> 13:48.687
to be included in the truth.

13:48.722 --> 13:50.056
Especially if I can help.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.690
If Cat is in some
sort of trouble,

13:51.725 --> 13:53.226
I want to help.

13:53.260 --> 13:55.061
Tess, please!

13:55.095 --> 13:57.997
Just tell me what's going on,
I beg you.

13:58.031 --> 14:00.099
Don't shut me out, okay?

14:00.134 --> 14:02.701
Cat's the only family
I got left.

14:06.773 --> 14:08.907
Um... it's big.

14:08.941 --> 14:10.075
Her secret, I mean.

14:10.109 --> 14:11.843
What she's been going through.

14:11.878 --> 14:13.044
Okay.

14:13.079 --> 14:14.780
You have to promise

14:14.814 --> 14:16.682
not to freak out, okay?

14:16.716 --> 14:18.417
Yeah.

14:22.488 --> 14:24.522
It's about Vincent Keller.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.424
Cat's in love with him.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.393
What?

14:29.461 --> 14:31.462
No, she...

14:31.497 --> 14:33.731
she just told me
that she stopped seeing him.

14:33.766 --> 14:35.967
Yeah, well, she is, so...

14:36.002 --> 14:37.535
That liar!

14:37.569 --> 14:39.304
No, Heather, the thing is
he's innocent.

14:39.338 --> 14:40.938
What, is she out of her mind?

14:40.972 --> 14:42.307
I'm going to kill her!

14:42.341 --> 14:45.075
No, where are you go...
Wait...

14:45.110 --> 14:46.311
Oh, crap.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.613
(bell jingles)

14:48.647 --> 14:50.114
(sighs)

15:02.794 --> 15:04.228
Did you get a good
look at him?

15:04.262 --> 15:05.996
This vigilante?

15:06.031 --> 15:07.497
No, he was just some guy.

15:07.532 --> 15:10.767
Ray, something tells me

15:10.802 --> 15:12.436
you're not telling the truth.

15:12.470 --> 15:14.504
WADE:
<i>An unsolved murder,</i>

15:14.539 --> 15:16.105
a Ray Sheckman.
Ring any bells?

15:23.881 --> 15:25.615
(phone line ringing)

15:25.650 --> 15:28.084
WOMAN (over intercom):
Mr. Sheckman, line one for you.

15:28.118 --> 15:30.419
Who's calling?

15:30.454 --> 15:32.455
Gabe Lowan
from the DA's office.

15:32.489 --> 15:35.791
Something
about your brother Ray?

15:40.998 --> 15:42.865
This is Tom Sheckman.
Hi, Mr. Sheckman.

15:42.899 --> 15:44.867
Thanks for taking my call.
Look, I don't know

15:44.901 --> 15:46.836
what this is about, but if
I need my lawyer present...

15:46.870 --> 15:48.270
Nah, you don't need your lawyer.

15:48.304 --> 15:50.038
This is off the record.
In fact,

15:50.073 --> 15:51.807
I'll deny we even had
this conversation

15:51.842 --> 15:53.609
if you tell anyone.

15:53.643 --> 15:55.277
I'm listening.

15:55.311 --> 15:58.714
Some new evidence has surfaced

15:58.749 --> 16:00.782
regarding your brother's death.

16:00.816 --> 16:02.550
You mean his murder.

16:02.585 --> 16:05.053
A murder the police never
bothered to investigate.

16:05.088 --> 16:06.388
And they still don't want to
investigate it.

16:06.422 --> 16:07.622
Nor does my office.

16:07.656 --> 16:08.891
Then why the hell
are you calling?

16:08.925 --> 16:10.192
Because I know
who killed your brother.

16:10.226 --> 16:11.493
And I assumed
you might want to do

16:11.527 --> 16:12.694
something about that.

16:12.728 --> 16:14.763
Even if I can't.

16:20.436 --> 16:22.504
I don't know
what I'm expecting to find.

16:22.538 --> 16:24.506
Ray was murdered at this museum

16:24.540 --> 16:27.041
almost a year ago.

16:27.075 --> 16:30.912
Does the coroner's report say
exactly how he was killed?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.646
He was strangled.

16:32.680 --> 16:33.915
Strangled?

16:33.949 --> 16:35.749
And no investigation?

16:35.784 --> 16:37.751
How the hell did Gabe
get away with that one?

16:37.786 --> 16:41.722
We're never gonna
find anything here.

16:41.756 --> 16:44.558
Okay, uh, where exactly
was the body found?

16:44.592 --> 16:46.593
Um...

16:46.628 --> 16:48.262
uh, near the entrance,

16:48.297 --> 16:50.230
the bottom of the stairs here.

16:58.372 --> 16:59.573
What is it?

17:00.809 --> 17:01.809
(grunts)

17:08.082 --> 17:10.016
I can sense the struggle.

17:10.050 --> 17:12.685
The kill.

17:12.719 --> 17:14.619
It was definitely a beast.

17:14.655 --> 17:15.922
Gabe?

17:15.957 --> 17:17.757
I don't know.
But who else could it've been?

17:20.127 --> 17:22.528
(yelling, growling)

17:41.114 --> 17:43.615
Beast again?

17:43.649 --> 17:45.484
Somebody else.

17:45.518 --> 17:47.319
A witness.

17:47.354 --> 17:50.322
Not according to
the police report.

17:50.357 --> 17:52.257
The police report's wrong.

17:53.493 --> 17:55.326
He was scared.

17:55.361 --> 17:58.563
And he ran off
before they got here.

18:01.701 --> 18:03.535
(panting)

18:17.182 --> 18:19.650
Looks like Cinderella
lost a shoe.

18:21.686 --> 18:23.321
Maybe it was a worker,
a museum employee.

18:23.355 --> 18:24.855
I'll check the records.

18:24.890 --> 18:26.690
If we can ID him, maybe
we can get him to testify

18:26.725 --> 18:28.325
that he saw Gabe kill Ray.

18:28.359 --> 18:30.027
Cat?!

18:30.061 --> 18:31.328
Heather.

18:32.731 --> 18:35.165
I can explain.

18:35.199 --> 18:37.100
Wait, don't go!

18:38.637 --> 18:41.572
Well, this keeps getting
better and better.

18:45.476 --> 18:47.343
Just forget it,
I don't want to talk.

18:47.378 --> 18:49.079
Well, you're gonna have to
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

18:49.113 --> 18:51.581
Why? You're always going
somewhere when I want to talk.

18:51.615 --> 18:52.879
At least let me explain.

18:52.904 --> 18:54.769
For God sakes, Cat,
the man's a fugitive!

18:56.119 --> 18:57.353
Okay.

18:57.388 --> 18:59.322
Can you at least keep
your voice down?

19:01.124 --> 19:02.925
Look, I'm sorry for
not being available,

19:02.959 --> 19:05.228
for not being a good sister.

19:05.262 --> 19:07.396
Not being honest.
Yes.

19:07.430 --> 19:09.565
For not being honest,
especially for that.

19:11.634 --> 19:13.936
Heather, I am sorry.

19:15.839 --> 19:18.774
Just out of curiosity,

19:18.809 --> 19:20.976
how did you find me?

19:21.011 --> 19:23.112
That's your biggest concern?
You're dating a killer,

19:23.146 --> 19:24.613
and you want to know
how I found you?

19:24.647 --> 19:25.880
No, it's-it's...
Okay, first of all?

19:25.915 --> 19:27.716
He is not what
you think he is.

19:27.750 --> 19:29.984
And second, it's not my
biggest concern, it's just,

19:30.019 --> 19:33.255
half the world is out there
looking for me to find him.

19:33.289 --> 19:36.958
And yet you found me.

19:40.029 --> 19:41.329
Milo.

19:41.363 --> 19:43.732
Our first cat.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.901
It's the challenge question
on your Find Your Phone app.

19:46.936 --> 19:48.036
(laughs)

19:49.972 --> 19:51.806
Please don't be mad at Tess.

19:51.841 --> 19:54.508
No, I'm not.

19:54.543 --> 19:56.477
I'm actually happy she told you.

19:56.511 --> 19:57.778
I've wanted to.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.315
But I've been afraid...

20:01.350 --> 20:03.784
of this.

20:05.387 --> 20:07.688
Heather, it's just,

20:07.723 --> 20:09.457
it's so complicated.

20:09.491 --> 20:11.359
I don't even know
where to begin.

20:11.393 --> 20:13.627
How about beginning
with the truth for once?

20:15.663 --> 20:17.097
Cat, we have to move
past this somehow.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.332
Past the lying.

20:19.367 --> 20:20.847
past you shutting me
out of your life.

20:20.869 --> 20:22.869
Otherwise, what kind of future
do we have together?

20:28.309 --> 20:30.377
Okay.

20:30.411 --> 20:32.044
You really want to hear this?

20:32.079 --> 20:33.280
Yes.

20:33.314 --> 20:35.649
Okay.

20:37.518 --> 20:39.185
You remember...

20:39.219 --> 20:40.787
you remember the night Mom died?

20:40.821 --> 20:42.689
I told you

20:42.723 --> 20:44.190
that crazy story

20:44.224 --> 20:47.260
about some beast rescuing me?

20:49.163 --> 20:51.030
Well...

20:51.064 --> 20:52.498
(chuckles)

20:52.532 --> 20:55.467
...believe it or not,
that was Vincent.

20:55.502 --> 20:57.170
And I didn't know that

20:57.204 --> 20:59.071
until I found him
ten years later.

20:59.106 --> 21:00.306
And even then, I didn't know

21:00.340 --> 21:02.008
that he was a beast of course.

21:02.042 --> 21:03.141
"A beast"?
- Right.

21:03.176 --> 21:04.743
But only because
he was a part

21:04.778 --> 21:06.878
of this secret
government experiment

21:06.913 --> 21:08.714
that went terribly wrong.

21:08.748 --> 21:11.149
(quiet laugh)
"Secret experiment."

21:11.184 --> 21:12.884
Yeah, and even when
we started dating,

21:12.919 --> 21:15.654
people were after him,
so-so I hid him,

21:15.689 --> 21:17.189
and I couldn't tell you
about that.

21:17.223 --> 21:18.990
And it only got worse

21:19.025 --> 21:21.026
when he got kidnapped
and they erased his memory

21:21.060 --> 21:23.261
and-and he became
a beast killer.

21:23.296 --> 21:27.098
But then when I dumped Gabe,
he became incredibly jealous.

21:27.133 --> 21:28.733
And then he-he wanted to take
down Vincent for this murder

21:28.767 --> 21:30.702
that was really
just self-defense.

21:30.736 --> 21:33.638
(exhales)

21:36.308 --> 21:38.108
No, H-Heather, wait!

21:38.143 --> 21:40.177
Wait, where you going?
What's wrong?

21:40.212 --> 21:43.113
"What's wrong?"
Really?

21:43.148 --> 21:45.216
I ask you, I-I beg you
to tell me the truth,

21:45.250 --> 21:47.251
and that cockamamie story
is what you come up with?

21:47.285 --> 21:48.686
Do you think I'm an idiot?

21:48.721 --> 21:50.555
No, of course I don't, but...
You know,

21:50.589 --> 21:52.756
I've had it, Cat,
I-I really have.

21:52.790 --> 21:54.631
I came here hoping to reconnect
with my sister,

21:54.659 --> 21:56.727
to have a relationship again
with the only family

21:56.761 --> 21:58.729
I've got left,
but just forget it, okay?

21:58.763 --> 22:01.431
I'll pick out my damn
wedding dress myself.

22:01.466 --> 22:03.633
(door opens, bell jingles)

22:03.668 --> 22:06.003
Wedding dress?

22:07.138 --> 22:08.372
(sighs)

22:08.406 --> 22:09.740
TOM:
<i>Vincent Keller?</i>

22:09.774 --> 22:11.040
The guy who's
all over the news,

22:11.075 --> 22:12.376
he killed my brother?

22:12.410 --> 22:13.577
Yeah.

22:13.611 --> 22:14.745
Why?

22:14.779 --> 22:15.979
You remember hearing about

22:16.013 --> 22:17.313
that vigilante last year?

22:17.348 --> 22:18.448
The one who killed
all those people?

22:18.483 --> 22:20.950
Yeah. He died.

22:20.985 --> 22:22.986
No, he didn't.
He's still alive.

22:23.020 --> 22:24.320
And he
killed Ray.

22:24.355 --> 22:25.488
That's one of the many reasons

22:25.522 --> 22:26.555
we want Keller caught.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.224
But you can't find him.

22:28.259 --> 22:30.326
No, but I'm hoping you can.

22:30.361 --> 22:32.228
I'll take justice
any way I can get it.

22:32.263 --> 22:33.429
(sighs)

22:37.134 --> 22:38.834
What could I do about it?

22:38.869 --> 22:40.503
I run a legitimate
business here.

22:40.537 --> 22:42.004
Give me a break.

22:42.038 --> 22:43.672
Look, I'm doing you
a favor here.

22:43.707 --> 22:45.408
You don't want it,
don't take it.

22:45.442 --> 22:46.475
How do I know you're not
saying all this

22:46.510 --> 22:48.343
just to get me to do
your dirty work,

22:48.378 --> 22:50.746
then catch me in the act
and put me away, too?

22:50.781 --> 22:52.915
This can't come back
to bite me in the ass, Sheckman,

22:52.949 --> 22:54.082
DA's office, either.

22:54.117 --> 22:56.018
If I burn you, you burn me,

22:56.052 --> 22:57.286
and I'm not stupid.

22:57.320 --> 22:58.820
And I'm not buying it.

22:58.854 --> 23:00.455
Not without any proof.

23:00.489 --> 23:02.791
Look, don't get me wrong.
If Vincent Keller

23:02.825 --> 23:04.026
killed my brother,

23:04.060 --> 23:05.627
I'll rip him to shreds.

23:05.661 --> 23:07.262
But I just can't take
your word for it.

23:07.297 --> 23:09.431
There's too much
at stake for me.

23:15.037 --> 23:17.371
There, um...

23:17.406 --> 23:18.740
was a girl there.

23:20.175 --> 23:21.375
I don't know why she was there,

23:21.410 --> 23:22.577
but she was.

23:26.048 --> 23:27.816
My sister's a cop!

23:27.850 --> 23:29.150
Shut up, Heather!

23:29.184 --> 23:30.819
You guys...
(grunts)

23:30.853 --> 23:32.719
Keller saved her...

23:32.754 --> 23:34.388
from your brother.

23:34.423 --> 23:36.958
(snarling)

23:36.992 --> 23:39.026
Ray was gonna kill her.

23:39.061 --> 23:41.228
I don't care about that.

23:41.263 --> 23:43.797
I just care if she saw
Keller kill my brother.

23:43.832 --> 23:46.567
No.

23:46.601 --> 23:49.336
But she is the only one

23:49.370 --> 23:51.839
who can tie Vincent Keller
to your brother's death.

23:51.873 --> 23:53.206
What's her name?

23:53.240 --> 23:55.843
That's not really necessary,
is it?

24:03.451 --> 24:05.918
You cannot hurt her.

24:05.953 --> 24:07.988
You have to promise me.

24:08.022 --> 24:09.722
Her name.

24:11.592 --> 24:14.060
All I found out is that
this guy quit his job

24:14.095 --> 24:16.229
right after Ray
Sheckman was found dead.

24:16.263 --> 24:18.164
And this is his last
known address, apparently.

24:18.199 --> 24:20.700
I'll wait at
the car, okay?

24:22.402 --> 24:23.603
Jack Watson?

24:23.637 --> 24:25.204
Yeah?

24:25.238 --> 24:26.606
Detective Catherine
Chandler, NYPD.

24:26.640 --> 24:28.073
Do you mind if I ask
you a few questions?

24:28.108 --> 24:29.341
About?

24:29.376 --> 24:30.610
About a murder you witnessed

24:30.644 --> 24:32.378
at the museum, a year ago.

24:32.412 --> 24:34.747
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

24:38.318 --> 24:39.351
You sure?

24:43.789 --> 24:45.991
Can I come in?

24:47.327 --> 24:48.260
Yeah.

24:59.972 --> 25:01.406
You were there,
weren't you?

25:03.342 --> 25:04.543
Did you catch
the guy?

25:06.345 --> 25:07.579
No.

25:07.613 --> 25:09.948
No, we didn't.

25:13.452 --> 25:14.752
That's why I'm here.

25:14.786 --> 25:16.187
We need your help.

25:21.160 --> 25:24.495
I knew it was just
a matter of time.

25:24.530 --> 25:26.264
I knew you'd come
sooner or later.

25:26.298 --> 25:28.398
I don't know what
I was thinking.

25:30.334 --> 25:32.436
You weren't thinking.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.572
You were

25:34.606 --> 25:37.074
probably afraid...

25:37.108 --> 25:39.610
of what you saw, right?

25:41.345 --> 25:43.880
What <i>did</i> you see?

25:48.719 --> 25:50.153
Why do we have
to talk down here?

25:50.188 --> 25:52.456
A cop's brother
was killed, Ray.

25:52.490 --> 25:54.357
We have to
be careful.

25:54.392 --> 25:58.261
Now, you're sure that
it was an accident, right?

25:58.296 --> 26:00.496
The vigilante was just trying
to save the girl...

26:00.530 --> 26:01.764
that's what you'll testify?

26:01.799 --> 26:03.967
Yeah.
That's right.

26:04.001 --> 26:05.534
Sorry, Ray,

26:05.569 --> 26:07.103
but I can't
have anyone

26:07.137 --> 26:08.605
exonerating the vigilante.

26:08.639 --> 26:11.307
(snarling)

26:11.341 --> 26:13.610
(Ray grunts)

26:13.644 --> 26:15.979
(snarling)

26:22.252 --> 26:24.953
(Jack gasps)

26:24.988 --> 26:27.356
(panting)

26:29.159 --> 26:30.826
(snarling)

26:36.032 --> 26:37.866
I'm not sure what I saw.

26:39.769 --> 26:41.536
You saw a man get killed, right?

26:43.740 --> 26:45.341
And then you saw
that killer turn on you.

26:47.443 --> 26:48.844
How do you know that?

26:48.878 --> 26:51.179
I know...

26:53.616 --> 26:56.551
I know what it's like
to keep a secret,

26:56.585 --> 26:58.386
a big one.

26:58.420 --> 27:00.588
How that can
weigh on you,

27:00.623 --> 27:03.424
isolate you, even.

27:03.459 --> 27:05.860
And I also know that

27:05.894 --> 27:07.261
the way to set yourself free

27:07.295 --> 27:08.829
is to tell the truth.

27:11.466 --> 27:12.499
Please.

27:12.534 --> 27:14.769
Please help us catch

27:14.803 --> 27:16.203
the man who did this.

27:20.776 --> 27:23.443
I'm afraid.

27:23.478 --> 27:26.346
He won't hurt you.

27:26.381 --> 27:28.148
I won't let him.

27:36.956 --> 27:38.757
It looks
beautiful on you.

27:41.628 --> 27:43.128
I don't know.

27:43.163 --> 27:45.463

the strapless one on again.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.666

- Not at all.

27:54.908 --> 27:56.108

27:56.142 --> 27:58.276
Tess is on
her way over.

27:58.311 --> 27:59.912
She'll take Jack
down to the precinct

27:59.946 --> 28:01.313
so he can make
his statement to Captain Ward

28:01.347 --> 28:03.147
and then we'll
see what happens.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.550

make it to Heather's wedding.

28:15.361 --> 28:16.628

Cat, help.

28:18.197 --> 28:19.430

Heather, what's wrong?

28:19.464 --> 28:20.664
Where are you?

28:20.699 --> 28:21.933
She's with me.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.301
Who is this?

28:24.336 --> 28:25.803
Ray Sheckman's brother.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.138
And if you want
your sister back,

28:27.172 --> 28:29.841
tell Vincent Keller
to come find her.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.876
I hear he's good at that.

28:38.031 --> 28:39.329
No one saw anything.

28:39.330 --> 28:41.355
Heather would never leave
without paying for that dress.

28:41.356 --> 28:42.556
Maybe she didn't
have a choice.

28:42.591 --> 28:44.391
Can you
track her?

28:44.426 --> 28:46.093
Well, Tom Sheckman
obviously thinks I can.

28:46.128 --> 28:47.828
How does he
even know that?

28:47.862 --> 28:49.997
Gabe.
- What? Gabe?

28:50.031 --> 28:51.265
How else would
Sheckman know

28:51.299 --> 28:52.766
that Heather was
there, right?

28:52.800 --> 28:53.767
She must've said
something to Gabe

28:53.801 --> 28:55.402
and Gabe
told Sheckman.

28:55.437 --> 28:57.338
No, but he would never put
Heather in danger like that.

28:57.372 --> 28:58.572
Th-That's not
protecting me.

28:58.607 --> 28:59.840
And why would
he even be

28:59.874 --> 29:01.374
in communication
with Sheckman?

29:01.408 --> 29:02.609
Unless...

29:02.644 --> 29:04.177

Wait, it's a trap.

29:29.136 --> 29:30.903
Catherine, it's gonna
be fine, okay?

29:30.937 --> 29:32.638
Grab Tess after she
drops the witness off.

29:32.673 --> 29:34.606
I might need some back up,
just in case Gabe is there.

29:34.641 --> 29:36.542
And don't worry,
I will call you

29:36.576 --> 29:38.510

and I will find her.

my brother.

38:16.351 --> 38:18.019
Do you want the good news
or the bad news first?

38:18.054 --> 38:20.488
The good news.

38:20.522 --> 38:22.590
Jack ID'd Gabe in the lineup.

38:22.624 --> 38:24.592
That's fantastic.

38:24.626 --> 38:26.594
Yeah, and Ward put Jack
into protective custody

38:26.628 --> 38:29.430
until after the arraignment,
which is set for tomorrow.

38:29.464 --> 38:32.300
Okay... and the bad news?

38:33.569 --> 38:37.037
Well, um, Gabe made bail.

38:37.072 --> 38:38.472
Of course, he did.

38:38.507 --> 38:40.007
What's he got
up his sleeve, now?

38:40.041 --> 38:41.342
He's not getting away
with this, Vincent,

38:41.376 --> 38:42.710
not after
everything he's done.

38:42.744 --> 38:45.680
I can't believe that he
put Heather in danger

38:45.714 --> 38:47.047
and tried to get you killed.

38:47.082 --> 38:48.316
Well, he's
getting desperate

38:48.350 --> 38:50.050
and if memory serves me...

38:50.085 --> 38:51.318
it's not a good thing.

38:51.352 --> 38:53.286
Once a beast, always a beast.

38:53.321 --> 38:54.588
Mm. Something like that.

38:56.557 --> 38:57.958
I just can't wait till
the guy gets locked up,

38:57.992 --> 39:00.027
so we can come out
of hiding, you know?

39:02.030 --> 39:03.197
Anyway, what happened
with your badge?

39:03.231 --> 39:05.898
Well, Tess got her's back,

39:05.933 --> 39:08.201
but since I'm still
sleeping with a fugitive...

39:08.236 --> 39:10.537
Well, not lately...
you're not.

39:12.206 --> 39:14.974
Yeah? No one's watching.

39:15.008 --> 39:16.843

40:27.179 --> 40:29.613
Hey-hey.

40:29.647 --> 40:30.881
What, what're you
doing here?

40:30.916 --> 40:32.316
I let you go once,
but not again.

40:32.350 --> 40:33.617
Don't, please.

40:33.651 --> 40:35.986
Shut up and listen to me.

40:36.021 --> 40:38.055
If you testify
against me...

40:38.089 --> 40:40.291
if you don't retract
everything you said,

40:40.325 --> 40:42.326
I'm gonna
find you again...

40:42.360 --> 40:43.627
and then
I'm gonna kill you.

40:43.661 --> 40:44.994
(grunts)
You understand me?

40:45.029 --> 40:45.829
Help!

40:45.863 --> 40:46.896
(grunts)

40:46.931 --> 40:47.897
Shut up, I said!

40:47.932 --> 40:49.999
He's gonna kill me!
