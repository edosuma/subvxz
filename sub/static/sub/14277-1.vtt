00:11.244 --> 00:13.144
<i>This is the story</i>

00:13.213 --> 00:16.649
<i>of how a person
got from point A</i>

00:16.716 --> 00:19.241
<i>to point Z.</i>

00:19.319 --> 00:22.846
<i>Some call it fate,
others, chance.</i>

00:22.922 --> 00:24.856
<i>But whatever
you call it,</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:28.792
<i>it sure is an interesting thing
to ponder, don't you think?</i>

00:28.862 --> 00:32.127
<i>The twisted paths
our lives follow.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:33.893
<i>How did you get here?</i>

00:33.967 --> 00:37.368
<i>The place where you are
right now at this very moment.</i>

00:37.437 --> 00:40.600
<i>What series of events
brought you to this place?</i>

00:40.673 --> 00:44.609
<i>At this specific
point in time?</i>

00:44.677 --> 00:47.077
<i>Where are you in life?</i>

00:47.147 --> 00:50.344
<i>Are things turning out
the way you'd planned?</i>

00:50.417 --> 00:52.612
<i>And by the way,
when was the last time</i>

00:52.685 --> 00:54.744
<i>you spoke with
your parents?</i>

00:54.821 --> 00:57.119
<i>Don't you think you
ought to give them a call?</i>

00:57.190 --> 01:01.149
<i>To thank them for the set of circumstances</i>

01:01.227 --> 01:03.457
<i>that brought
them together,</i>

01:03.530 --> 01:05.259
<i>at a certain place,</i>

01:05.331 --> 01:08.425
<i>at a certain
moment in time,</i>

01:08.501 --> 01:12.562
<i>when you
were created.</i>

01:14.607 --> 01:17.167
What were we
talking about?

01:17.243 --> 01:20.212
<i>How you
got here.</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:23.875
Yeah.

01:23.950 --> 01:26.077
Jesus Christ,
I can't believe

01:26.152 --> 01:28.746
I'm still so...

01:28.822 --> 01:29.846
uh,

01:29.923 --> 01:31.686
<i>Stoned?</i>

01:31.758 --> 01:33.726
Yeah!

01:33.793 --> 01:38.594
<i>A glass of orange juice sure would
hit the spot about now, wouldn't it?</i>

01:38.665 --> 01:41.532
<i>And some Tostitos.</i>

01:41.601 --> 01:44.468
That's it!
Oh, man!

01:44.537 --> 01:46.300
That's exactly
what I'm thinking!

01:46.372 --> 01:48.272
OJ and Tostitos!
Jesus!

01:48.341 --> 01:50.935
It's like you're reading
my thoughts or something!

01:51.010 --> 01:53.342
<i>I am.</i>

01:53.413 --> 01:56.143
Whoa.

01:56.216 --> 01:57.740
So go on.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.944
What am I thinking about now?

02:00.019 --> 02:03.113
<i>Well, there are many thoughts
racing through your head.</i>

02:03.189 --> 02:06.989
<i>The first concerns the
orange juice and Tostitos.</i>

02:07.060 --> 02:09.152
Yeah.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.627
<i>And the second,</i>

02:10.697 --> 02:13.723
<i>the second thought,
oh, how it vexes you.</i>

02:13.800 --> 02:16.462
Uh-huh.
What is it?

02:16.536 --> 02:18.299
<i>It is this.</i>

02:18.371 --> 02:23.331
<i>Why are you having a conversation
with Roscoe Lee Browne?</i>

02:23.409 --> 02:27.345
Ha!
Roscoe Lee?

02:27.413 --> 02:30.576
Holy shit!
You're famous!

02:30.650 --> 02:32.311
<i>Yes, I am.</i>

02:32.385 --> 02:37.550
I can't fucking believe
I'm having a conversation

02:37.624 --> 02:40.024
with Roscoe
Lee Browne!

02:40.093 --> 02:42.994
<i>Okay. Ready
for number three?</i>

02:43.062 --> 02:45.690
You bet I
am, Roscoe.

02:45.765 --> 02:48.529
<i>Your third thought
is simply this:</i>

02:49.836 --> 02:51.201
<i>How in the hell</i>

02:51.271 --> 02:53.569
<i>did I end up
on a ferris wheel?</i>

02:55.375 --> 02:56.808
How did
you know that?

02:56.876 --> 02:59.310
<i>Because, you
fucking pothead,</i>

02:59.379 --> 03:01.347
<i>you're talking
to yourself.</i>

03:06.419 --> 03:10.412
Shit. How the hell
did I get here?

03:39.185 --> 03:41.551
<i>I guess maybe it was</i>

03:41.621 --> 03:44.715
<i>a little early in the
morning to be getting stoned.</i>

03:47.493 --> 03:48.858
<i>But whatever,
you know.</i>

03:48.928 --> 03:50.520
<i>It's not like
I just sit around</i>

03:50.597 --> 03:53.691
<i>collecting checks from
my parents or something.</i>

03:53.766 --> 03:56.234
<i>I did that regional
soda ad a while back,</i>

03:56.302 --> 03:59.203
<i>Doctor Bjorn's Famous
Old-Fashioned Root Beer.</i>

03:59.272 --> 04:02.173
<i>Maybe you saw it? Anyhow, between that</i>

04:02.242 --> 04:04.904
<i>and unemployment I
get by. Bla-bla-bla.</i>

04:04.978 --> 04:06.878
<i>All I know
is this game is</i>

04:06.946 --> 04:10.882
<i>so fucking cool
when you're high.</i>

04:10.950 --> 04:13.680
<i>They say a true pothead
stops getting the munchies</i>

04:13.753 --> 04:16.745
<i>after a certain point.
I mean, a true pothead</i>

04:16.822 --> 04:19.620
<i>wouldn't even say the word
"munchies. " I don't know</i>

04:19.692 --> 04:21.683
<i>what the true
pothead would say,</i>

04:21.761 --> 04:25.629
<i>"Munchos" or "hungries"
or something.</i>

04:27.467 --> 04:30.595
<i>At any rate, I still
love to eat when I'm high.</i>

04:30.670 --> 04:32.570
<i>So fuck you
if you're too cool</i>

04:32.639 --> 04:34.869
<i>to get hungry
when you're stoned.</i>

04:39.479 --> 04:44.041
<i>My free one year supply of
Doctor Bjorn's. Neat, huh?</i>

04:58.231 --> 05:01.792
<i>In the six months I've lived
with my roommate, Steve,</i>

05:01.868 --> 05:04.462
<i>I've never seen
him get high.</i>

05:05.371 --> 05:06.929
<i>Not once.</i>

05:07.006 --> 05:12.205
<i>He even kind of looks
down on me for doing it.</i>

05:12.278 --> 05:14.803
God, you are
so pathetic.

05:14.881 --> 05:16.781
H uh?

05:16.849 --> 05:19.477
<i>Here's the deal
with Steve.</i>

05:19.552 --> 05:22.419
<i>He scares me.</i>

05:22.488 --> 05:25.480
Oh, hi, Steve.

05:30.363 --> 05:31.955
<i>See what I mean?</i>

05:32.031 --> 05:33.999
<i>Steve's one of those
"Dress in costume</i>

05:34.067 --> 05:35.932
<i>and wait in line
for Star Wars" types,</i>

05:35.935 --> 05:36.935
<i>but angry.</i>

05:36.936 --> 05:39.268
<i>Real anti-social.</i>

05:39.339 --> 05:42.035
<i>I've always tried to
stay on Steve's good side,</i>

05:42.108 --> 05:45.407
<i>who knows what can happen
with a weirdo like that?</i>

05:50.850 --> 05:53.614
Mm!
Mm!

06:07.734 --> 06:10.168
<i>I know he made that sign telling me not to,</i>

06:10.236 --> 06:14.536
<i>but I had a counterplan.
A really good counterplan.</i>

06:14.607 --> 06:17.303
<i>I would bake Steve some more cupcakes.</i>

06:17.377 --> 06:19.345
<i>Some even
better cupcakes.</i>

06:30.490 --> 06:32.720
<i>And then,</i>

06:32.792 --> 06:35.659
<i>I recognized
the true nature</i>

06:35.728 --> 06:39.687
<i>of the cupcakes
I had consumed.</i>

06:57.316 --> 06:59.250
Oh, shit.

08:27.139 --> 08:29.539
<i>Oh, fuck.</i>

08:29.609 --> 08:32.772
Listen, Jane. I really busted my ass

08:32.845 --> 08:35.506
getting you this audition
so please, please, please

08:35.581 --> 08:38.515
don't fuck it up. It seems
like you don't even give

08:38.583 --> 08:40.414
a shit about
any of this.

08:40.486 --> 08:43.784
Do you? Do you even give a shit?

08:43.856 --> 08:46.051
I give a shit.

08:48.160 --> 08:52.028
Plan... need a plan.

09:04.577 --> 09:05.942
My plan.

09:06.012 --> 09:09.846
<i>Number one.
Buy more pot.</i>

09:09.916 --> 09:12.942
<i>You know, so I can make
more cupcakes for Steve.</i>

09:13.019 --> 09:15.852
<i>Number two: use
the money Steve left</i>

09:15.922 --> 09:18.220
<i>for the power bill to
purchase said pot.</i>

09:18.291 --> 09:20.316
<i>That way I can bake some fresh cupcakes</i>

09:20.393 --> 09:21.724
<i>before he gets back.</i>

09:21.794 --> 09:23.819
<i>Then I'll go
to my audition.</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:27.161
<i>I mean, number three:
go to my audition.</i>

09:27.233 --> 09:30.225
<i>I've never been to an
audition this stoned before.</i>

09:30.303 --> 09:33.170
<i>but I'd be willing to wager
that I'd be damned good</i>

09:33.239 --> 09:35.867
<i>because I'll be even more in
touch with my creative self!</i>

09:35.942 --> 09:38.706
<i>That's not really a part
of the plan. Scratch that.</i>

09:42.348 --> 09:46.182
<i>Four: hit the cash machine, zip
on over to pay that power bill,</i>

09:46.252 --> 09:48.186
<i>pick up cupcake
supplies at the store</i>

09:48.254 --> 09:50.347
<i>and head on back to home base to bake 'em up.</i>

09:54.293 --> 10:00.391
Not bad... for a person who
happens to be quite stoned.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.404
You're baked.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.473
<i>No.</i>

10:08.541 --> 10:10.406
What makes
you think that?

10:15.281 --> 10:19.183
Just, you
know, the usual.

10:19.251 --> 10:22.584
Actually, you better make it a full ounce.

10:22.655 --> 10:25.146
I'm gonna be making some cupcakes.

10:25.224 --> 10:27.556
You got it.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.634
<i>What's going on
over there?</i>

10:41.707 --> 10:43.971
Who's there? Is someone in my apartment?

10:44.043 --> 10:47.171
Man, you really
are stoned.

10:48.414 --> 10:50.746
<i>Number one:
Buy more pot.</i>

10:56.455 --> 10:57.945
You're like
40 short.

11:00.059 --> 11:02.527
Can I just...

11:02.595 --> 11:03.721
you know...

11:06.098 --> 11:08.760
Goddamn it, Jane,
this is the last time.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.665
You have to pay
me back today.

11:10.736 --> 11:12.465
No problem-o.

11:12.538 --> 11:15.029
I'm marking it
down... in the book.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.942
<i>I just gotta hit the cash machine, my man.</i>

11:30.489 --> 11:32.320
<i>It's all
about capitalism</i>

11:32.391 --> 11:34.484
<i>and shit like
that, you know?</i>

11:34.560 --> 11:37.290
<i>Who creates the jobs?
Where do they come from?</i>

11:37.363 --> 11:39.058
<i>The profits I make, for example,</i>

11:39.131 --> 11:42.999
trickle down through the economy
in ways I can't even comprehend.

11:43.069 --> 11:46.163
It makes sense. I'm
totally vibing you, dude.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.866
Yeah, simple Reaganomics apply
to the production of hemp.

11:48.941 --> 11:54.641
Well, I don't think that really
qualifies as Reaganomics, but...

11:54.714 --> 11:56.341
What are you
talking about?

11:56.415 --> 11:58.975
Just because
weed isn't taxed

11:59.051 --> 12:02.214
doesn't mean it exists in some sort of,

12:02.288 --> 12:06.224
you know, laissez faire paradigm or whatever.

12:06.292 --> 12:08.283
Did you just use "paradigm" in a sentence?

12:08.360 --> 12:09.554
<i>Yeah, man.</i>

12:09.628 --> 12:11.596
I mean, what you do is great and all,

12:11.664 --> 12:14.030
God bless you
for it, but it sounds

12:14.100 --> 12:16.830
like plain old market
capitalism to me.

12:16.902 --> 12:18.563
It's Reaganomics.
Trust me.

12:18.637 --> 12:23.540
What about it is Reaganomics?
The black market isn't taxed.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.804
Listen, Jane,
you're fucking stoned

12:25.878 --> 12:28.438
and I happen to be very
knowledgeable about this.

12:28.514 --> 12:32.917
Whoopee! You own a U V lamp.
Let's start the revolution!

12:32.985 --> 12:35.283
What the fuck do you know
about economics anyway?

12:35.354 --> 12:40.451
Well... I majored in economics in college

12:40.526 --> 12:43.518
and graduated
fucking Summa.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.928
I think I know a thing or two about it.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.064
I thought you
were an actress.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.894
Economics didn't
really work out.

12:57.543 --> 12:59.135
This is
where I'll be.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.543
<i>Meet me there with the
money at three o'clock.</i>

13:01.614 --> 13:04.742
Yeah.
Okay.

13:09.522 --> 13:10.887
<i>What is this?</i>

13:10.956 --> 13:14.619
I've never even heard
of half of these movies.

13:16.028 --> 13:17.791
<i>Oh.</i>

13:17.863 --> 13:21.924
Actually, my
roommate's hosting this

13:22.001 --> 13:26.495
science fiction nerd convention this weekend

13:26.572 --> 13:29.564
with his buddies flying
in from Toledo and...

13:29.642 --> 13:30.734
Hey!

13:30.810 --> 13:33.677
Three o'clock!
Meet me in Venice

13:33.746 --> 13:36.112
with the money
at three.

13:36.182 --> 13:38.275
Do not make me send my associates over here

13:38.350 --> 13:40.215
to collect
the hard way.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.651
You mean,
like kill me?

13:41.720 --> 13:43.153
No, Jesus.
Of course not.

13:43.222 --> 13:46.191
So you'll probably just break my arms, then?

13:46.258 --> 13:47.953
Break your arms? Janey, what the fuck?

13:48.027 --> 13:49.119
I'm a dude
who sells weed,

13:49.195 --> 13:50.662
I'm not Tony
fucking Soprano.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.061
Well, what then?

13:53.132 --> 13:54.531
I don't know.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.397
Take your furniture,
or something.

14:01.273 --> 14:02.331
Hmm.

14:04.076 --> 14:05.737
So, Jane,

14:08.414 --> 14:09.938
what's the deal
with your roommate?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.642
Steve?

14:13.118 --> 14:14.449
What about him?

14:14.520 --> 14:15.919
He gives me
the creeps.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.650
I think he might be one
of those skull fuckers.

14:19.725 --> 14:20.783
Know what
I'm saying?

14:20.860 --> 14:26.560
I bet that dude
fucks skulls,

14:26.632 --> 14:28.122
with candles
and shit.

14:39.011 --> 14:40.638
Oh my God!
You're right!

14:40.713 --> 14:42.146
He's a fucking freak.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.681
So, listen.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.377
It would be a shame if you
didn't pay me back today,

14:46.452 --> 14:48.283
and in addition to taking your furniture,

14:48.354 --> 14:49.685
I had to tell
your roommate

14:49.755 --> 14:52.519
how you spent the cash for the power bill.

15:34.300 --> 15:35.494
Hello?

15:35.567 --> 15:37.501
<i>Jane?</i>

15:37.569 --> 15:39.799
Hey!

15:39.872 --> 15:42.067
Is this...?

15:42.141 --> 15:43.733
Who is this?

15:43.809 --> 15:45.436
<i>It's Kyle.</i>

15:45.511 --> 15:47.843
Oh, hey, baby,
what's up?

15:47.913 --> 15:49.574
<i>You asked me
to call you</i>

15:49.648 --> 15:52.412
<i>to remind you to go to that audition?</i>

15:54.053 --> 15:55.315
<i>Are you stoned?</i>

15:55.387 --> 15:56.911
Stoned?

15:56.989 --> 16:00.720
<i>It's fucking 10:45
in the morning.</i>

16:00.793 --> 16:04.092
<i>Know what, Jane? This
isn't really working out.</i>

16:04.163 --> 16:08.099
I don't understand.
You're speaking in riddles.

16:09.702 --> 16:15.106
Kyle, you need to
listen very carefully

16:15.174 --> 16:20.510
to what I'm saying and stop
trying to confuse the issue.

16:22.047 --> 16:26.541
What? Wait, Kyle!
I can't hear you!

16:26.618 --> 16:31.612
Kyle! Hold on! I
just have to... Shut up!

16:34.660 --> 16:36.628
Oh, shit.

16:45.070 --> 16:48.335
Kyle? You still there?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.541
Now what am
I gonna do?

16:59.218 --> 17:01.015
I can't.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.387
I daren't.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.723
I really shouldn't.

17:23.175 --> 17:25.665
<i>The government weed.</i>

17:27.813 --> 17:31.647
<i>I was saving the government
weed for a special occasion,</i>

17:31.717 --> 17:36.780
<i>but the government weed will fetch
a fair price on the open market.</i>

17:36.855 --> 17:39.153
<i>A very fair price.</i>

17:40.826 --> 17:43.818
<i>Maybe just enough to bail me out of this jam.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:46.364
<i>Number three:
Go to my audition.</i>

18:42.654 --> 18:43.916
Whoa.

18:43.989 --> 18:46.116
That was intense.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.613
Getting on?

19:16.688 --> 19:18.656
I've never ridden a bus in L.A. before.

19:18.724 --> 19:19.816
This is
gonna be fun.

19:19.892 --> 19:24.420
Yeah, you're in
for a real treat.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.371
<i>Hey I You squashed
Bobby's car.</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:46.811
<i>He spent weeks putting that together.</i>

19:49.054 --> 19:50.817
Hey, right on. Look what you've done.

19:50.889 --> 19:52.356
<i>I saw her.
She just</i>

19:52.424 --> 19:55.689
fell right over. She
didn't even try to stay up.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.695
Hey! One
thirty-five!

19:57.763 --> 19:58.821
Okay.
Hold on.

19:58.897 --> 20:00.825
- Get up.
- I'm trying.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.457
There's something
wrong with her.

20:02.534 --> 20:05.332
There's nothing wrong with me, lady.

20:05.404 --> 20:07.395
What was it doing on the floor anyway?

20:07.472 --> 20:09.269
It wasn't on the floor, fucking pothead.

20:09.341 --> 20:10.706
You knocked it out of his hands.

20:10.776 --> 20:11.970
I saw it.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.375
I'm sorry.

20:13.445 --> 20:15.413
That's not gonna bring his car back.

20:15.480 --> 20:16.708
I think she's
on drugs.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.579
He built that for his grandfather,

20:18.650 --> 20:20.117
in the hospital.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.812
Hey, lady!
One thirty five!

20:21.887 --> 20:23.320
I'm getting it!

20:30.062 --> 20:31.359
Hey!

20:31.430 --> 20:32.430
Hey!

20:42.341 --> 20:44.536
That was a close one.

20:45.944 --> 20:47.206
<i>"Come on, Frank.</i>

20:47.279 --> 20:49.474
<i>"You know
I love surprises.</i>

20:49.548 --> 20:53.644
<i>That's a fact. I'm always
willing to make exceptions. "</i>

20:53.719 --> 20:57.485
What a piece of shit.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.114
"Come on, Frank.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.715
"You know
I love surprises.

willing to make exceptions?"

21:05.897 --> 21:08.229
" I'm always willing
to make exceptions!"

21:09.868 --> 21:12.735
" I'm always willing
to make exceptions!

21:14.306 --> 21:17.207
" I'm always willing
to make exceptions!"

21:31.623 --> 21:33.420
<i>Four. Hit the
cash machine.</i>

21:41.500 --> 21:47.735
I had over a thousand
dollars in this account!

Oh, yeah.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.479
Oh, no!

22:05.557 --> 22:08.583
Take your furniture
or something like that.

22:08.660 --> 22:13.859
No! Not my bed! Not my Sleep Number bed!

22:23.542 --> 22:24.873
<i>Hey</i>

22:30.716 --> 22:32.707

22:46.098 --> 22:50.364

know I love surprises. "

23:05.083 --> 23:06.243
Have a seat.

23:23.101 --> 23:24.101
Hi.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.033
Do you have
any gum?

23:29.941 --> 23:31.602
I, uh,

23:31.676 --> 23:33.735
wait.

23:38.350 --> 23:42.013
Holy shit! Where'd this come from?

23:43.355 --> 23:44.355
Do you
want some?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.084
No, thank you!
No, no, no.

23:46.158 --> 23:49.594
Seriously. I could really use the cash.

23:49.661 --> 23:51.026
No, I don't.

23:51.096 --> 23:52.358
200 bucks.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.594
No, I don't want any.
No. I don't want it.

24:05.210 --> 24:08.373
I'm really
stoned. Sorry.

24:19.591 --> 24:24.085

Hi! I'm Jane. It's nice to meet you.

24:38.243 --> 24:42.373
I, um, heard
a lot about you.

24:42.447 --> 24:44.005
Excuse me?

24:44.082 --> 24:47.574
Nothing.

How are you?

24:56.561 --> 24:58.324
I'm fine.

Great!

<i>Hang on a second.</i>

25:03.902 --> 25:06.065
- What?
- Huh?

25:06.137 --> 25:07.798
Did you just
say something?

25:07.873 --> 25:10.104
- Who, me?
- Yes.

25:10.175 --> 25:12.837
I'm sorry. I didn't realize I had spoken.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.620
Are you ready?

25:24.689 --> 25:27.317
I sure am.

25:28.460 --> 25:29.620
<i>Are you ready?</i>

25:29.694 --> 25:31.855
I sure am.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.421
Okay.

"Come on, Frank!

25:45.310 --> 25:47.335
You know
I love surprises!"

25:47.412 --> 25:48.777
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

25:48.847 --> 25:50.678
I want you to do it again, but this time,

25:50.749 --> 25:53.240
pull it
way back.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.149
Okay. Sure.
Sure. You got it.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.387
"Come on, Frank. You
know I love surprises. "

26:02.394 --> 26:03.394
What are
you doing?

26:03.395 --> 26:04.828
I'm pulling it back.

26:04.896 --> 26:08.832
Not that much. Can't you
find some middle ground?

26:08.900 --> 26:11.892
You better believe I can
find a middle ground!

26:11.970 --> 26:13.995
Middle ground
is my middle name!

26:19.044 --> 26:20.511
Thank you.

26:20.579 --> 26:21.876
So how'd I do?

26:21.947 --> 26:24.541
You did some
very interesting work.

26:24.616 --> 26:28.746
Really?
Yes!

26:28.820 --> 26:34.690
Well, thanks. You have a wonderful day.

26:37.262 --> 26:40.231
<i>Hey, let me
ask you something.</i>

26:41.700 --> 26:44.396
Do you want to
buy some pot?

26:46.738 --> 26:49.969
Are you trying
to sell me drugs?

26:50.041 --> 26:51.133
Well...

26:51.209 --> 26:53.871
Young lady, have
a seat outside!

26:53.945 --> 26:55.469
Gee, you don't
have to yell.

26:55.547 --> 26:56.547
Sit!

26:56.615 --> 26:57.615
Here?

26:57.616 --> 26:59.083
In the
waiting area!

26:59.150 --> 27:01.482
<i>Bob I Get

27:03.888 --> 27:06.322
Tried to sell
me marijuana.

27:06.391 --> 27:09.883
Hey! Guys, I
was just kidding.

27:26.811 --> 27:29.006
She tried to
sell you what?!

27:36.521 --> 27:39.081
<i>? Do you remember
Anyone here?</i>

27:41.860 --> 27:44.852

28:23.268 --> 28:24.997
I'm just

28:26.438 --> 28:29.669
Still shitting!
Nothing to worry about.

28:29.741 --> 28:32.039
I'm just taking
a big old dump.

28:37.849 --> 28:42.752
<i>That's it. All done. I'm finished.</i>

28:42.821 --> 28:46.154
You got nothing on me! Nada! Zilcho!

28:46.224 --> 28:48.488
Go ahead and frisk me!
Give it your best shot!

29:13.251 --> 29:15.276
Hello there, Smiley.

29:15.353 --> 29:18.015
Hi, Jane.

29:29.701 --> 29:32.602
<i>Meet me in
Venice at three.</i>

29:34.172 --> 29:36.606
You better
get going.

29:36.674 --> 29:42.044
I'm way ahead of you,
Smiley. Way ahead of you.

29:48.686 --> 29:49.686

29:53.191 --> 29:54.522
<i>This is Shelly.</i>

29:54.592 --> 29:55.923

a message.</i>

29:55.994 --> 29:58.326
<i>Hey, Shelly!
Guess who!</i>

29:58.396 --> 30:00.489
So, listen. I'm
looking for a ride

30:00.565 --> 30:03.932
out to Venice for this Hemp Festival thing.

30:04.002 --> 30:06.402
And it sounds
cool, right?

30:06.471 --> 30:08.371
Anyway, I thought
you might dig it.

30:08.439 --> 30:11.272
But I guess
you're not there.

30:11.342 --> 30:13.367
Um,

30:13.444 --> 30:18.245
Jesus, Shelly, I'm so fucking
stoned you wouldn't believe it!

30:18.316 --> 30:19.316
Call me.

30:21.719 --> 30:24.119
<i>Hi, please leave
a message</i>

30:24.189 --> 30:26.589
<i>for me or Tony

30:28.960 --> 30:30.757
Uh,

30:30.829 --> 30:32.490
who is
this again?

30:40.805 --> 30:42.170
<i>Hello?</i>

30:42.240 --> 30:43.571
<i>Mrs. Green?</i>

30:43.641 --> 30:44.665
<i>Yes.</i>

30:44.742 --> 30:46.573
It's Jane!

30:46.644 --> 30:48.009
<i>Who?</i>

30:48.079 --> 30:52.038
Jane! I studied
clarinet with you!

30:52.116 --> 30:58.282
<i>It doesn't really ring
a... H mm, I, I don't...</i>

31:00.625 --> 31:03.116
<i>Brevin Ericson.</i>

31:11.870 --> 31:15.067
Oh, boy.

31:15.139 --> 31:19.337
<i>Shall we say a few words
about Brevin Ericson?</i>

31:19.410 --> 31:22.243
<i>Shall we say a few words about love?</i>

31:24.649 --> 31:27.345
<i>For Brevin Ericson
is completely,</i>

31:27.418 --> 31:31.821
<i>100 % head over heels in love.</i>

31:33.658 --> 31:36.058
<i>Perhaps it's difficult
for you to comprehend</i>

31:36.127 --> 31:39.563
<i>how anybody could be so
passionately inclined toward</i>

31:39.631 --> 31:42.464
<i>someone like this.</i>

31:42.533 --> 31:44.933
<i>But do not judge
her too harshly.</i>

31:45.003 --> 31:49.201
<i>After all, how was she to
know they were pot cupcakes?</i>

31:49.274 --> 31:52.641
<i>And ask yourselves,
who amongst you</i>

31:52.710 --> 31:54.405
<i>might not have
done the same?</i>

31:54.479 --> 32:00.008
<i>Who are we to judge heartbeats
in a young man's heart?</i>

32:06.824 --> 32:10.453
<i>Do you want Lightning
Strikes Thrice?</i>

32:10.528 --> 32:11.756
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:11.829 --> 32:13.353
<i>Do you want
Secret Secret Agents?</i>

32:13.398 --> 32:14.398
I already have...

32:14.399 --> 32:19.234
Exactly.

32:19.304 --> 32:24.367
Dude, your roommate
is kind of hot.

32:26.844 --> 32:29.472
You're kidding,
right?

33:52.697 --> 33:56.690
<i>You're so good.</i>

33:56.768 --> 34:00.204
<i>No!</i>

34:00.271 --> 34:02.569
<i>Oh, Brevin I</i>

34:02.640 --> 34:04.301
<i>You're beating me.</i>

34:04.375 --> 34:05.865
<i>Damn it I</i>

34:09.614 --> 34:14.516
<i>Oh, Brevin,
right in there.</i>

34:14.585 --> 34:16.780
<i>Oh I</i>

34:16.853 --> 34:20.221
Oh, yeah.

34:20.291 --> 34:24.318
But...

34:24.395 --> 34:26.862
I thought you
had a boyfriend.

34:26.931 --> 34:30.025
We're kinda taking a break right now.

34:30.101 --> 34:31.568
Mm-hmm.

34:31.636 --> 34:33.501
<i>What's that got
to do with anything?</i>

34:33.571 --> 34:39.532
I'm talking about something
bigger than our petty yearnings.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.771
Of course.

34:44.114 --> 34:46.139
So are we doing
this or what?

34:46.217 --> 34:47.706
<i>Well...</i>

34:47.784 --> 34:51.186
Come on, man. It's going to
be fucking transformative.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.553
It sounds great.
I just...

34:53.623 --> 34:55.148
<i>What?</i>

34:56.393 --> 34:58.954
I, uh...

35:03.201 --> 35:07.160
So, you are sure you want to
come to the dentist with me?

35:07.238 --> 35:10.298
Absolutely, man.
Absolutely.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.241
Let me just drop you off at
a coffee shop or something.

35:13.311 --> 35:15.939
No, not necessary,
my good man.

35:16.013 --> 35:17.640
I'm really looking
forward to it.

35:17.715 --> 35:19.876
So last week they worked on my left side.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.112
Today they're gonna
finish on my right.

35:22.186 --> 35:26.316
And I tell you, Jane, they really
get in there deep with the scraping.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.757
A deep scraping?

35:29.827 --> 35:31.385
Yeah.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.522
That sounds
fucking awesome.

35:34.599 --> 35:36.430
Maybe I
should get one.

35:36.501 --> 35:39.493
I think you need
an appointment.

35:39.570 --> 35:42.061
Oh, yeah.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.267
An appointment.

36:06.430 --> 36:10.127
Yep, that's pretty
funny I guess.

36:10.201 --> 36:13.227
I don't even know
what I'm laughing at.

36:15.506 --> 36:19.499
So, how much do you think you'd need?

36:21.812 --> 36:25.111
I don't know.
Like five...

36:25.183 --> 36:26.445
Dollars?

36:26.517 --> 36:28.348
Yeah, I need
to borrow $5.

36:28.419 --> 36:30.785
Well, what then?
Like $500?

36:30.855 --> 36:33.346
Yeah, that
should do it.

36:34.625 --> 36:35.751
Really?

36:35.826 --> 36:38.021
Hey, if you can't,
it's no biggie.

36:38.095 --> 36:40.893
No, I can
swing that.

36:40.965 --> 36:42.728
Really?

36:42.800 --> 36:44.427
You're gonna pay
me back, right?

36:44.502 --> 36:48.199
Absolutely.
Of course.

36:48.272 --> 36:53.175
My wallet's in the glove box. Get it for me?

36:54.946 --> 36:57.471
I may have five C notes right here.

36:57.548 --> 36:59.641
That would be
so fucking great.

37:04.689 --> 37:06.919
Nope. I don't
have it.

37:06.991 --> 37:08.856
We're gonna have to stop at a machine.

37:08.926 --> 37:12.657
Why do you need
500 dollars again?

37:14.298 --> 37:15.298
Well...

37:28.913 --> 37:33.247
I don't think Steve
would fuck a skull.

37:33.317 --> 37:35.911
Why do you keep it in the glove box?

37:35.987 --> 37:37.215
What?

37:37.288 --> 37:39.085
Your wallet.

37:39.156 --> 37:43.286
It's too thick. It hurts
my butt when I'm driving.

37:43.361 --> 37:46.330
That makes
total sense.

37:51.402 --> 37:52.402
Hey!

37:52.403 --> 37:53.563
What?

37:53.638 --> 37:57.039
<i>Oh I I've been
to that housel</i>

37:57.108 --> 37:58.108
Which house?

37:58.109 --> 37:59.474
That one back there!

37:59.543 --> 38:01.534
An old college professor of mine lives there.

38:01.612 --> 38:05.346
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:05.416 --> 38:06.974
He was a pretty
good dude.

38:07.051 --> 38:09.042
What'd he teach?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.714
Marxist studies.

38:11.789 --> 38:13.848
Marxist studies.

38:13.924 --> 38:15.949
Yup.

38:16.027 --> 38:22.557
He introduced me to some
pretty out there concepts.

38:22.633 --> 38:27.093
Some pretty
radical ideas.

38:27.171 --> 38:32.575
So, were you, like,
seeing him?

38:34.011 --> 38:35.945
What do you mean,
"seeing him?"

38:36.013 --> 38:41.417
Were you
seeing him?

38:41.485 --> 38:43.214
Do you mean
like dating him?

38:43.287 --> 38:44.481
Yeah.

38:44.555 --> 38:47.319
He was a fucking
Marxist, man!

38:47.391 --> 38:48.915
Marxist?

38:48.993 --> 38:52.622
Why would you even ask something like that?

38:52.697 --> 38:53.697
Oh.

38:58.102 --> 39:00.195
There's a space.

39:00.271 --> 39:02.138
- Where?
- Right there, man!

39:04.909 --> 39:06.774
Come on, dude! We don't want to be late

39:06.844 --> 39:08.835
for that dentist
appointment of yours!

39:08.913 --> 39:10.437
U h, right, right.
Right.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.040
You comin'
or what?

39:20.858 --> 39:21.916
Yeah.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.856
So are
you scared?

39:29.934 --> 39:33.495
About what,
the dentist?

39:33.571 --> 39:37.371
No, I've never really been
bothered by going to the dentist.

39:37.441 --> 39:41.537
It would freak the shit out of me
right now if I had to go in there.

39:41.612 --> 39:44.479
I don't think
I could handle it.

39:44.548 --> 39:47.381
I kind of like it.

39:47.451 --> 39:51.478
I mean, it's not like I'm a
masochist or anything, it's just,

39:51.555 --> 39:55.548
well, in a way, it
makes me feel like,

39:55.626 --> 39:57.059
yeah,

39:57.128 --> 40:02.191
my teeth are being taken care of, you know?

40:02.266 --> 40:04.894
It make me feel...

40:04.969 --> 40:06.493
prosperous.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.738
I'm sorry, were you talking about something?

40:11.809 --> 40:14.209
U m,

40:14.278 --> 40:16.371
Oh, yeah.
Great.

40:16.447 --> 40:21.214
It makes you feel prosperous or something.

40:30.127 --> 40:31.958
I'm bored.

40:33.998 --> 40:35.363
Ericson?

40:35.433 --> 40:37.162
That's me.

40:37.234 --> 40:40.931
Okay, I guess I will see you in a little bit.

40:43.574 --> 40:46.600
Till we
meet again

40:49.146 --> 40:50.511
Okay.

40:57.121 --> 40:59.715
He's not my boyfriend or anything.

40:59.790 --> 41:01.451
Just a friend.

41:01.525 --> 41:07.259
I n case you were wondering
what my relationship to him was.

41:07.331 --> 41:08.730
Or not.

41:35.993 --> 41:39.156
How's it going?

42:15.466 --> 42:16.831
Thanks, Gina.

42:16.901 --> 42:21.201
Oh! Thank
fucking God!

42:21.272 --> 42:24.867
This has been
the longest, dullest...

42:24.942 --> 42:28.810
most uncomfortable thing
I can remember ever doing.

42:28.879 --> 42:32.246
I really thought I was gonna die of boredom.

42:32.316 --> 42:33.806
I gotta pay still.

42:33.884 --> 42:38.048
Oh, come on.
Can't we go already?

42:49.633 --> 42:52.124
<i>Hey, Jane. What time
do you think it was</i>

42:52.202 --> 42:53.226
that I picked you?

42:58.642 --> 43:00.269
What was that?

43:03.347 --> 43:05.679
Hey.

43:05.749 --> 43:09.446
Why don't you come over here
while your friend's talking to you?

43:12.356 --> 43:14.415
<i>Young lady,
come here.</i>

43:16.560 --> 43:18.221
Come here!

43:32.676 --> 43:33.870
Look at me.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.580
Look at me. I'm not playing games here.

43:39.316 --> 43:44.310
It's really bright
out, officer.

43:44.388 --> 43:50.850
Would you mind removing
your hand from your forehead?

43:50.928 --> 43:54.796
It's really
bright out.

43:54.865 --> 43:57.561
What's your name?

43:57.635 --> 43:58.635
Uh...

44:00.738 --> 44:02.899
Christy?

44:02.973 --> 44:05.840
You don't sound too sure of that.

44:05.909 --> 44:08.469
No, it's Christy.

44:08.545 --> 44:10.638
Well, Christy,

44:13.017 --> 44:16.748
how come your friend just
called you Jane a second ago?

44:19.590 --> 44:25.028
Jane's, uh, my...

44:25.095 --> 44:26.960
religious name?

44:29.066 --> 44:30.795
Your religious name?

44:30.868 --> 44:33.462
Am I
under arrest?

44:33.537 --> 44:35.528
Why would you be
under arrest?

44:35.606 --> 44:37.733
Have you done something I should know about?

44:37.808 --> 44:41.904
No, I... shit.
I mean, shoot!

44:45.649 --> 44:49.585
Sir, do you mind opening your trunk for me?

44:49.653 --> 44:51.245
My trunk?

44:51.321 --> 44:59.524
No. Wait, excuse me. We
called you because... my car...

45:03.867 --> 45:05.858
Now, Christy,

45:05.936 --> 45:12.171
am I gonna find whatever kind
of drugs you're on in here?

45:12.242 --> 45:15.370
Christy.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.573
Chris-ty.

45:17.648 --> 45:20.515
Oh, Jesus
Christ, Jane!

45:20.584 --> 45:22.552
Yeah?

45:22.619 --> 45:24.416
Her name's not Christy, it's Jane.

45:24.488 --> 45:25.921
I don't even know why you're doing that.

45:25.989 --> 45:29.152
<i>What do you have in here, son?</i>

45:29.226 --> 45:31.091
I don't know.
Just some stuff.

45:31.161 --> 45:32.958
Folders that
I was supposed

45:33.030 --> 45:35.555
<i>to bring to my dad's office
but didn't because he's an ass.</i>

45:35.632 --> 45:37.429
What's that?

45:37.501 --> 45:39.435
A tennis racket.

45:39.503 --> 45:43.234
<i>And that is a tennis ball. I wish
I had more, but my dog eats them.</i>

45:43.307 --> 45:45.707
Jack head,
paper clips,

45:47.978 --> 45:48.978
shoes,

46:29.119 --> 46:30.245
Hello.

46:30.320 --> 46:33.084
H i.

46:33.157 --> 46:34.317
You're a
little early.

46:37.294 --> 46:40.286
Well, are you coming in or what?

46:41.765 --> 46:42.765
H uh.

46:46.336 --> 46:49.897
<i>Peter's not back
from the airport yet.</i>

46:49.973 --> 46:54.205
So why don't you just have a
seat and I'll go get it for you?

46:54.278 --> 46:55.438
Okay.

46:55.512 --> 46:58.242
Would you like something to drink?

46:58.315 --> 47:02.081
U h, do you have
any lemonade?

47:02.152 --> 47:07.488
Oh, no. I'm sorry. How
about some orange juice?

47:07.558 --> 47:10.959
Yeah, that sounds
good actually.

47:11.028 --> 47:13.656
All right.
Are you hungry?

47:13.730 --> 47:17.962
Well... now that
you mention it,

47:19.269 --> 47:21.533
I wouldn't mind something to munch on.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.732
You know, like chips or whatever.

47:23.807 --> 47:26.173
Well, let me see what I can find.

47:38.222 --> 47:39.814
<i>Here we go.</i>

47:39.890 --> 47:41.482
Thanks.

47:44.194 --> 47:45.661
What's with
the corn?

47:45.729 --> 47:48.323
<i>Excuse me?</i>

47:48.398 --> 47:50.730
Oh, that's a photo of Peter's.

47:50.801 --> 47:54.237
I suppose that's his idea
of avant-garde or something.

47:57.007 --> 48:00.067
How long have you been Peter's T.A.?

48:00.143 --> 48:03.341
- Who?
- Peter.

48:03.413 --> 48:06.177
Oh, you mean
Professor Harwood.

48:06.250 --> 48:07.877
<i>Yes.</i>

48:07.951 --> 48:11.148
Well, for quite
a while now.

48:11.221 --> 48:15.385
I guess it didn't work
out with that other girl.

48:15.459 --> 48:17.586
I guess not.

48:17.661 --> 48:22.496
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, uh...

48:25.235 --> 48:26.361
Jane.

48:26.436 --> 48:29.701
Jane. I'm Shirley,
Peter's mother.

48:29.773 --> 48:33.539
Shirley, of course. Peter
talks about you all the time.

48:33.610 --> 48:35.601
He does?

48:35.679 --> 48:40.548
Oh, yeah.
Constantly.

48:51.595 --> 48:55.622
I'll just go and get what you came for,

48:55.699 --> 48:58.065
so that you can
be on your way.

49:01.638 --> 49:05.301
<i>That is where corn chips come from.</i>

49:05.375 --> 49:10.779
<i>H mm, maybe old Professor
Harwood is onto something.</i>

49:10.847 --> 49:13.645
<i>He probably
really loves corn,</i>

49:13.717 --> 49:16.447
<i>and all corn
related products.</i>

49:16.520 --> 49:19.318
<i>I mean, isn't that what you're
supposed to put in a frame?</i>

49:19.389 --> 49:20.686
<i>Things you love?</i>

49:20.757 --> 49:23.885
<i>I'm gonna do that.
When I get home,</i>

49:23.961 --> 49:26.691
<i>I'm gonna frame a bunch of stuff I love.</i>

49:26.763 --> 49:31.462
<i>Like lasagna.
I love lasagna.</i>

49:31.535 --> 49:37.371
<i>It's so good,
and cheesy.</i>

49:37.441 --> 49:41.878
<i>You know who else loves lasagna? Garfield.</i>

49:41.945 --> 49:45.847
<i>Man, that cat really
loves lasagna.</i>

49:45.916 --> 49:49.784
<i>Maybe I should put a picture
of Garfield in a frame.</i>

49:49.853 --> 49:54.415
<i>As a kind of shorthand way
of saying I love lasagna.</i>

49:54.491 --> 49:58.552
<i>That would be
so fucking inside.</i>

49:58.628 --> 50:02.826
<i>Or how about a photo
of President Garfield?</i>

50:02.899 --> 50:06.027
<i>Oh, shit. That'd
be totally meta.</i>

50:06.103 --> 50:09.095
<i>People would be all like,
"Jane, why do you have a photo</i>

50:09.172 --> 50:11.299
<i>of President Garfield
on your mantle?"</i>

50:11.375 --> 50:15.072
<i>And I'd be like "Because I
like lasagna, of course. "</i>

50:22.252 --> 50:26.211
<i>Oh, my,
what happened?</i>

50:26.289 --> 50:27.779
Did you fall?

50:29.726 --> 50:32.854
Yes, that's exactly
what happened.

50:32.929 --> 50:39.528
I was reaching for something
and I kind of rolled off.

50:39.603 --> 50:42.299
Well, are you
all right?

50:42.372 --> 50:43.964
Oh yeah,
I'm fine.

50:44.041 --> 50:46.635
Are you hiding
from someone?

50:46.710 --> 50:49.474
Of course not. Why would you ask that?

50:49.546 --> 50:52.515
It seems like you're hiding from somebody.

50:52.582 --> 50:57.144
I don't know what you're
talking about, Shirley.

51:00.690 --> 51:02.214
Well,

51:02.292 --> 51:03.691
here you go.

51:03.760 --> 51:07.594
Great. Thanks
a lot.

51:07.664 --> 51:10.497
Now I'm sure Peter's told you this already,

51:10.567 --> 51:12.694
but he wanted me to be sure
to tell you to take this

51:12.769 --> 51:15.567
straight to his office
and put it in the safe.

51:17.174 --> 51:20.837
Oh, of course.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.970
Well, I guess
that's it then.

51:23.046 --> 51:24.343
Okay.

51:24.414 --> 51:26.382
See yah.

52:26.109 --> 52:27.940
Holy fucking shit.

52:44.928 --> 52:46.225
Oh!

52:48.031 --> 52:49.031
Hi.

52:49.099 --> 52:50.361
Hi.

52:50.433 --> 52:55.894
I'm just waiting for my clothes to dry.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.605
Those are
my clothes.

53:00.677 --> 53:06.707
<i>Right. I'm waiting for your
clothes to dry, so that I can...</i>

53:06.783 --> 53:10.685
dry my clothes.

53:10.754 --> 53:13.279
Where are
your clothes?

53:13.356 --> 53:15.847
I n my bathtub.

53:17.794 --> 53:19.159
Excuse me.

53:23.200 --> 53:24.394
Hey,

53:24.467 --> 53:27.459
let me ask
you something.

53:27.537 --> 53:32.372
Suppose you had
a very rare...

53:32.442 --> 53:34.069
Let go of my arm.

53:34.144 --> 53:36.544
Sorry.

53:36.613 --> 53:39.173
We're cool. We're just talking here, right?

53:39.249 --> 53:40.375
Laundry buddies.

53:40.450 --> 53:42.179
Do you even live
in this building?

53:42.252 --> 53:46.484
That's not relevant right now, laundry buddy.

53:46.556 --> 53:52.188
Let's suppose a person
had in their possession,

53:52.262 --> 53:58.895
a very old...
very rare...

54:01.972 --> 54:02.996
book.

54:03.073 --> 54:04.438
What kind
of book?

54:04.507 --> 54:06.998
A very
influential book.

54:07.077 --> 54:10.513
A book that has changed history.

54:10.580 --> 54:13.208
I have no idea what the
fuck you're talking about.

54:13.283 --> 54:16.912
Hey, dude. What's with the hostility?

54:16.987 --> 54:18.716
You give me
the creeps.

54:18.788 --> 54:20.085
The creeps?

54:20.156 --> 54:21.851
Take it
somewhere else

54:21.925 --> 54:23.358
before I call
the cops?

54:23.426 --> 54:27.453
Whoa! Hold
on there!

54:27.530 --> 54:30.727
If you want me to leave, I can go.

54:30.800 --> 54:31.892
Thank you.

54:31.968 --> 54:33.697
I'm going, dude.

54:33.770 --> 54:35.567
Goodbye, dude.

54:37.874 --> 54:40.809
It's always me.

54:56.059 --> 54:58.220
Sweet mother
of Christ.

55:01.331 --> 55:02.331
What 're
you doing?

55:02.365 --> 55:04.697
I'm just,
I was trying...

55:04.768 --> 55:05.928
I'm calling
the cops.

55:06.002 --> 55:08.334
Hey, don't do that.

55:08.405 --> 55:11.169
I'm gonna give it back. I swear!

55:11.241 --> 55:17.976
What use could I possibly have
for a musty 200-year old book?

55:18.048 --> 55:21.381
<i>Don't put me
on hold I</i>

55:21.451 --> 55:23.248
Hey!

55:23.320 --> 55:27.416
<i>She's getting away I will find
you I am a Marine Reservist I</i>

55:52.782 --> 55:54.875
Phew.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.453
No.

56:12.902 --> 56:15.496
Wow, do you
look fucked up.

56:15.572 --> 56:17.699
Come on, Hercules.

56:25.882 --> 56:28.077
<i>Aw, cute pig.</i>

56:31.054 --> 56:32.919
The truck bed's open.

56:34.824 --> 56:36.655
It's headed west.

56:39.763 --> 56:41.162
To Venice.

56:44.934 --> 56:46.902
I don't see
the connection.

56:48.938 --> 56:53.739
Wait a minute.
It's coming to me.

56:58.181 --> 57:00.308
Buzz.

57:22.939 --> 57:25.669
It smells like
sausage in here.

57:33.983 --> 57:36.281
Time for a
revised plan.

57:38.354 --> 57:40.754
<i>Number one: Get to that Hemp Festival.</i>

57:40.824 --> 57:45.454
<i>Number two: Try to convince
Steve not to steal my furniture.</i>

57:45.528 --> 57:48.463
<i>Especially not my bed. Oh God.</i>

57:48.531 --> 57:50.624
<i>Anything but that.</i>

57:54.037 --> 57:57.097
<i>Number three: Once I've convinced
Steve not to steal my bed,</i>

57:57.173 --> 57:59.835
<i>try to figure out a way to
return the Communist Manifesto</i>

57:59.909 --> 58:03.902
<i>without getting arrested. Possibly
via the U. S. Postal Service.</i>

58:03.980 --> 58:08.474
<i>No, Global Express
is much more reliable.</i>

58:08.551 --> 58:12.453
Now that sounds like an awesome revised plan.

58:18.361 --> 58:21.592
<i>Next stop:
Venice, California.</i>

58:41.217 --> 58:43.811
<i>Holy shit I</i>

58:43.887 --> 58:44.887
What?

58:49.792 --> 58:50.816
Dude.

59:04.674 --> 59:06.642
Are we in
Venice yet?

59:06.709 --> 59:08.199
Venice?!

59:08.278 --> 59:12.305
Lady, we, we're in fucking El Monte.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.145
Where?

59:16.386 --> 59:18.013
Do you guys
kill pigs here?

59:18.087 --> 59:20.214
No, that happens way before they get here.

59:20.290 --> 59:23.054
We keep the pigs on ice
though, until we need them.

59:23.126 --> 59:26.095
Shut the fuck up.

59:26.162 --> 59:27.162
Albert, she asked.

59:27.230 --> 59:29.425
Hey, fellas.

59:29.499 --> 59:30.989
Now you
did it.

59:31.067 --> 59:32.694
<i>What are you
doing on the floor?</i>

59:32.769 --> 59:34.430
<i>Who the hell
are you?</i>

59:34.504 --> 59:38.167
You know the rules, Mikey. No
girlfriends allowed in the plant.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.641
Oh no, M r. Spencer,
this isn't my girl...

59:40.710 --> 59:44.669
I'm not his girlfriend, dude. Believe me.

59:44.747 --> 59:49.241
Mikey, Albert, would
you mind explaining to me

59:49.319 --> 59:50.547
<i>what's going
on here?</i>

59:50.620 --> 59:51.746
<i>U h...</i>

59:51.821 --> 59:53.618
I'm here to organize a union.

59:53.690 --> 59:55.021
What?!

59:55.091 --> 59:57.924
That's right. I always make it a point

59:57.994 --> 59:59.928
to get to know the
workers personally,

59:59.996 --> 01:00:03.363
and these two gentlemen were kind
enough to give me a little tour.

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.526
Albert, I thought
we cleared up

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.093
all that union
nonsense last year.

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:10.139
We did, sir. I was just
showing her the way out.

01:00:10.206 --> 01:00:15.439
Look, M r. Spencer,
is it?

01:00:15.511 --> 01:00:20.505
How much stake do you personally
have in this organization?

01:00:20.583 --> 01:00:23.051
Well, not that it's any of your business,

01:00:23.119 --> 01:00:26.054
but I've got a very
generous benefit package.

01:00:26.122 --> 01:00:31.185
A generous
benefit package.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.888
Listen to how quickly
the lackey adopts

01:00:33.963 --> 01:00:35.590
the language of
his master.

01:00:35.665 --> 01:00:39.157
Ma'am, I am going to ask you one time nicely.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:42.727
Tell your people that we are not interested.

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:45.501
I'll tell my
people all right.

01:00:45.575 --> 01:00:48.544
But first, I have
a little message

01:00:48.611 --> 01:00:52.980
for you to tell
your people.

01:00:53.049 --> 01:00:55.745
You tell
your people

01:00:55.818 --> 01:01:00.152
the slaughterers of pigs,
the profiteering cowards

01:01:00.223 --> 01:01:03.090
who dishonestly hide
their dirty business

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:07.687
behind a sweet, happy
logo of a cute pig,

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:10.494
while they manufacture
misery and death.

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:11.658
Ma'am.

01:01:11.734 --> 01:01:15.431
Please, sir, allow
me to finish.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:18.906
<i>Just look around you.</i>

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:23.503
Do you see it?
Can you hear it?

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:28.141
And you, sir,
stand here

01:01:28.217 --> 01:01:31.812
in this warehouse
of death!

01:01:31.888 --> 01:01:35.085
And you have the audacity to tell me

01:01:35.158 --> 01:01:41.529
that you have a generous benefit package?

01:01:41.597 --> 01:01:43.087
And them?

01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:48.798
Do they have a generous benefit package?

01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:55.440
I think we all know the
answer to that. Don't we?

01:01:59.816 --> 01:02:03.718
It is a tale
as old as man.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:08.587
<i>The history of all hither
to existing society,</i>

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:10.558
is the history
of class struggle.

01:02:10.626 --> 01:02:14.756
<i>The free man and slave,
the lord and serf,</i>

01:02:14.831 --> 01:02:18.358
in a word, oppressor
and oppressed,

01:02:18.434 --> 01:02:22.700
<i>stood in constant opposition to one another,</i>

01:02:22.772 --> 01:02:25.935
carrying on an
uninterrupted fight.

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:28.476
A fight that each
time ended

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:33.982
in either revolutionary
reconstitution of society at large,

01:02:34.050 --> 01:02:41.582
or in a complete
and total ruin!

01:02:43.993 --> 01:02:46.052
You tell your
people that!

01:02:52.502 --> 01:02:56.939
You think you're
so, um, uh...

01:02:57.006 --> 01:03:02.444
Jesus! And then you go on
and on about this and that

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:06.414
and all this other bullshit
and all I have to say is

01:03:06.482 --> 01:03:12.910
fuck, man! I mean, this
situation is totally fucked.

01:03:12.989 --> 01:03:19.485
with a capital! I
mean, have you ever...

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:22.156
Do you like even...

01:03:23.499 --> 01:03:24.693
Well, do you?

01:03:27.904 --> 01:03:29.963
You tell your
people that.

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:44.045
<i>Meet me in
Venice at three.</i>

01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:47.783
<i>Take this straight to his
office and put it in the safe.</i>

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:50.417
<i>I'd probably take
your furniture.</i>

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:53.758
<i>Are you trying to
sell me drugs?</i>

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.025
<i>Young lady,
come here.</i>

01:03:56.098 --> 01:03:58.589
<i>Jane. Janel</i>

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.398
<i>You give me
the creeps.</i>

01:04:01.470 --> 01:04:06.533
<i>Christy.
Chris-ty</i>

01:04:06.609 --> 01:04:11.979
<i>Jesus! Jane.
Hey. Jane.</i>

01:04:12.048 --> 01:04:13.538
<i>Jane.</i>

01:04:19.088 --> 01:04:22.057
<i>Hey.</i>

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:26.618
<i>What are
you doing?</i>

01:04:26.696 --> 01:04:29.324
I don't even know
where I am.

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.559
Do you
want a ride?

01:04:31.634 --> 01:04:34.899
<i>Number one: Get to
that Hemp Festival.</i>

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:37.462
So you like to smoke a lot of weed, huh?

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.444
Not really.

01:04:57.927 --> 01:05:00.760
So are you like a Communist or something?

01:05:00.830 --> 01:05:05.665
No, man. I'm not a Communist.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:08.863
What's in Venice that you've got
to go all the way out there for?

01:05:11.641 --> 01:05:15.805
I'm supposed to
be meeting someone.

01:05:15.878 --> 01:05:16.878
Hmm.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.211
Can I ask
you something?

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:20.544
<i>Sure.</i>

01:05:20.616 --> 01:05:24.484
If you could,
with a single act,

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:28.353
change the whole trajectory
of your life, would you do it?

01:05:28.424 --> 01:05:31.154
The trajectory
of my life?

01:05:31.227 --> 01:05:37.632
<i>Yeah, the direction your life
is headed in. Where you're going.</i>

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:42.103
<i>U h, I don't
know. U m,</i>

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:45.937
I guess not. I've got a good job. Why?

01:05:46.008 --> 01:05:51.036
I'm thinking about changing the
trajectory of my life, that's all.

01:05:51.113 --> 01:05:54.139
That's cool.

01:05:54.216 --> 01:06:01.281
God. I get so horny
when I'm stoned.

01:06:01.357 --> 01:06:02.722
What?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:05.886
Pot makes me
so fucking horny.

01:06:05.962 --> 01:06:07.452
Does it have
that affect on you?

01:06:07.530 --> 01:06:09.896
I'm not stoned
right now. But...

01:06:09.966 --> 01:06:13.663
Let's just fuck. Right here, right now,

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:17.399
<i>In the car. In the middle
of this fucking traffic jam.</i>

01:06:17.473 --> 01:06:19.407
I don't want to get in an accident.

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:21.670
Come on, Mikey.
Fuck me.

01:06:21.744 --> 01:06:25.009
Fuck me right now.
You know you want to.

01:06:25.081 --> 01:06:27.982
Come on, Mikey.
Fuck me!

01:06:28.050 --> 01:06:30.883
<i>Fuck me! Yeah!
Fuck me!</i>

01:06:33.022 --> 01:06:35.582
Fuck me!
Oh, yeah!

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:38.422
Come on!
Fuck me, Mikey!

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:44.997
This traffic
sucks, huh?

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:47.602
Huh?

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.104
This traffic...
It sucks.

01:06:50.172 --> 01:06:53.801
Oh, yeah.

01:06:53.876 --> 01:06:55.901
Right.

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:56.978
Hmm.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.567
Oh, my God! No!
I got to go!

01:07:26.642 --> 01:07:28.507
We're on the freeway.
What are you doing?

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.045
I have to stop my dealer
from stealing my bed!

01:07:31.113 --> 01:07:32.512
What are you
talking about?

01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:34.947
There's no time to...
I gotta... Bye!

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.577
Jane!
Jane!

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:40.645
Where the hell
are you going?

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:41.723
Jane!

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:49.362
<i>Number two: Try to convince
Steve not to steal my bed.</i>

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:10.048
You shouldn't be walking on
the freeway. It's dangerous.

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:14.820
I guess.

01:08:14.890 --> 01:08:15.890
Where are
you headed?

01:08:15.925 --> 01:08:17.586
Venice.

01:08:17.660 --> 01:08:19.787
That's where
I'm going.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.022
I'll give
you a lift.

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:31.939
Hold on.

01:09:07.443 --> 01:09:11.538
Well, I hope you find whatever
it is you're looking for.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:14.344
Thanks.
You too.

01:09:25.127 --> 01:09:27.287
She was nice.

01:09:33.135 --> 01:09:37.469
Carrot Top!

01:09:58.127 --> 01:10:02.325
Excuse me, did you just
come from the Hemp Fest?

01:10:02.398 --> 01:10:05.162
No, man. I'm
from Bethlehem.

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.826
Oh, sorry.

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:09.996
Dude, I'm just fucking with
you. But it's kind of over.

01:10:10.072 --> 01:10:11.903
What?

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:14.670
You're a bong hit late. It's done-ski.

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.336
No!

01:10:27.823 --> 01:10:33.090
Hey, is this the Thirty-third
Annual Venice Hemp Fest?

01:10:33.162 --> 01:10:35.255
Not any more.

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.391
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

01:10:38.467 --> 01:10:40.560
I'm supposed to meet
my dealer here.

01:10:40.636 --> 01:10:42.536
Do you know him?
His name's Steve.

01:10:42.605 --> 01:10:46.006
Steve? Oh, yeah!

01:10:46.075 --> 01:10:50.102
<i>Is he a dude, he's got
like two arms, two legs,</i>

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.703
And a head.

01:10:53.983 --> 01:10:55.644
<i>That's Steve.
Yeah.</i>

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.151
Forget it.

01:12:05.254 --> 01:12:06.448
Have a fun ride.

01:13:43.252 --> 01:13:44.879
<i>In that moment,</i>

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:48.683
<i>perched high
above the earth,</i>

01:13:48.757 --> 01:13:52.386
<i>high above those who had
come so far to find her,</i>

01:13:52.461 --> 01:13:56.659
<i>Jane knew what
she had to do.</i>

01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:01.794
<i>Jane was no schemer, no conniver,</i>

01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:03.599
<i>no thief.</i>

01:14:06.141 --> 01:14:11.704
<i>Jane knew that deep down
she was pure of heart.</i>

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.805
<i>And that she did not want to contribute</i>

01:14:13.882 --> 01:14:18.319
<i>to the toll of human misery
and suffering in the world.</i>

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.712
<i>She knew the time had come</i>

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:24.816
<i>to take responsibility
for what she'd done,</i>

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:28.795
<i>and to return the book to its rightful owner.</i>

01:14:28.864 --> 01:14:34.029
<i>That her intentions were
honorable, that there'd be no doubt.</i>

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:39.802
<i>But what puzzled many on that day
was not the virtue of her intentions.</i>

01:14:39.875 --> 01:14:42.435
Hey!

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:45.742
<i>What puzzled
many was why.</i>

01:14:45.814 --> 01:14:49.215
Hey!

01:14:51.353 --> 01:14:54.584
<i>By what bizarre
and convoluted logic,</i>

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.749
<i>did she arrive at the decision to do</i>

01:14:56.825 --> 01:15:00.022
<i>what you're
about to see?</i>

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:05.158
<i>I n short, what the fuck was she thinking?</i>

01:15:05.234 --> 01:15:10.536
Whoa!
Hey!

01:15:10.606 --> 01:15:12.836
Up here!

01:15:12.908 --> 01:15:16.002
Brevin!
I'm up here!

01:15:22.885 --> 01:15:24.352
Oh no.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:52.442
Hey!

01:16:03.158 --> 01:16:04.158
Help.

01:17:36.118 --> 01:17:37.949
Whoa.

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:32.362
<i>So, my dad plays
golf with this guy,</i>

01:18:32.441 --> 01:18:36.434
<i>who is a pretty good
criminal attorney.</i>

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:38.706
I think he's
a criminal attorney.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:40.338
He's definitely
a lawyer.

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:43.942
I could try to hook you
up with him if you want.

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:47.580
Yeah, that
sounds good.

01:18:51.626 --> 01:18:57.155
Well, Brevin, it sure has
been a fucking day, huh?

01:18:58.633 --> 01:19:01.796
Yeah, I guess.

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:14.071
What a weird
fucking dream.

01:20:17.445 --> 01:20:21.006
Hey, stoner!
Back to work!

01:20:25.020 --> 01:20:27.250
Sorry.

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:30.758
<i>This has been the story
of how a person started at A,</i>

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:34.193
<i>got to Z, and
somehow ended up</i>

01:20:34.262 --> 01:20:38.164
<i>collecting garbage by
the side of the freeway.</i>

01:20:38.233 --> 01:20:42.329
<i>And I think you'll all agree
that much like life itself,</i>

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:48.639
<i>it certainly has been... one
hell of a crazy ride.</i>
