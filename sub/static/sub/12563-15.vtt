33:00.432 --> 33:02.033
What's going on right now?

33:02.034 --> 33:03.285
His aneurysm's compressing
his pneumogastric nerve.

33:03.286 --> 33:05.487
He could aspirate.
We have to protect his airway.

33:05.488 --> 33:06.871
- Here's a towel.
- How...

33:06.872 --> 33:09.791
Divya, he's out. Let's move.

33:15.715 --> 33:18.800
Okay, laryngoscope. Thank you.

33:21.220 --> 33:23.004
Tube.

33:23.005 --> 33:25.640
Thank you.

33:31.797 --> 33:34.132
Okay.

33:34.133 --> 33:36.401
I can't... um...

33:36.402 --> 33:39.020
- Hank.
- Yeah, I... uh...

33:39.021 --> 33:42.140
I just... I can't see his epiglottis.

33:42.141 --> 33:44.409
- Can you give it a try?
- Yes.

33:44.410 --> 33:46.745
Okay. Keep still.

33:46.746 --> 33:48.747
That's it.

33:56.455 --> 33:58.423

34:04.930 --> 34:07.331
[Breathes]

34:07.332 --> 34:10.835
Okay, okay. He's okay.

34:10.835 --> 34:13.554
Oh, my God. You hear that, buddy?

34:13.556 --> 34:16.056
Hey, Owen. It's all right, man.

34:16.058 --> 34:18.810
We're here.

34:24.967 --> 34:26.818
The surgeon made a small incision

34:26.819 --> 34:29.154
and inserted a stent
through the femoral artery.

34:29.155 --> 34:30.489
- Kind of like iron man.
- Yeah.

34:30.489 --> 34:33.992
And you came through the
procedure like a superhero, too.

34:33.993 --> 34:36.277
- Will I be...
- Save your voice, okay?

34:36.279 --> 34:40.532
You've been intubated and had
an endovascular aneurysm repair.

34:40.533 --> 34:43.368
Hm.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.487
You are, uh...

34:45.487 --> 34:48.040
Your finger hurts. You're kissing.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.858
- Really, dude?
- A water balloon?

34:49.859 --> 34:51.426
You're afraid of missing the wedding.

34:51.427 --> 34:52.994
- Yeah.
- You should be out of here

34:52.995 --> 34:54.829
in time to see Evan
sweat it out at the altar.

34:54.830 --> 34:56.664
Nice, man.
[Laughs]

34:56.665 --> 35:01.169
So that endovascular thing,
it's pretty pricey, right?

35:01.170 --> 35:04.839
You do our billing.
You know about medical expenses.

35:04.840 --> 35:07.109
Yeah, I just wonder if Owen
has insurance, that's all.

35:07.110 --> 35:09.695
Running a comic book store? I doubt it.

35:09.696 --> 35:11.113
The comic book store never happened.

35:11.114 --> 35:12.564
- I didn't tell you that?
- No.

35:12.565 --> 35:14.032
Dude, he's still at the hardware store.

35:14.033 --> 35:16.234
Oh, too bad. He was so excited about that.

35:16.235 --> 35:18.570
But don't worry, we'll
take care of him. He's family.

35:18.571 --> 35:21.573
Speaking of which,
we should get to the hotel.

35:21.574 --> 35:23.208
Yeah.

35:30.066 --> 35:34.169
Hey! You made it!

35:34.170 --> 35:36.755
It's my son's wedding.
This is all about family.

35:36.756 --> 35:38.840
- Of course I made it.
- Where's grandpa?

35:38.841 --> 35:41.209
He didn't make it.
He has an ear infection.

35:41.210 --> 35:44.179
- Aw, too bad. Hi, dad.
- Hi, Hankie.

35:44.180 --> 35:46.714
All right, I have a surprise for you.

35:46.715 --> 35:49.684
Ta-da. What do you think?

35:49.685 --> 35:52.487
I think your editor
made some pretty drastic cuts.

35:52.488 --> 35:53.822
Come on.

35:53.823 --> 35:54.889
That is the promotional card
for my new book,

35:54.890 --> 35:56.241
which comes out this spring.

35:56.242 --> 35:57.609
- Congrats!
- That's great!

35:57.610 --> 35:59.494
All right, now listen,
I hope you don't mind.

35:59.495 --> 36:02.864
I gave a stack to the gift basket girl.

36:02.865 --> 36:06.451
- You hired a gift basket girl?
- Yeah. Um, she's here?

36:06.452 --> 36:09.287
Oh, yeah, really cute.
You should see her cupcakes.

36:09.288 --> 36:12.424
- Her what now?
- What? She makes cupcakes.

36:12.425 --> 36:15.260
She also said she was
baking your wedding cake.

36:15.261 --> 36:16.762
Yeah. Yeah, she is.

36:16.763 --> 36:20.048
So, um, I'm gonna go check on her.

36:20.049 --> 36:23.418
Hank, would you mind taking
your dad's bags to his room?

36:23.419 --> 36:26.605
- Eddie and I need to conspire.
- Oh, very mysterious.

36:26.606 --> 36:27.973
- You bet.
- Thank you.

36:27.974 --> 36:30.225
- Okay. 211.
- Got it.

36:30.226 --> 36:31.726
- Thanks, Hank.
- You got it.

36:31.727 --> 36:34.262
So show me. I am dying to see it.

36:34.263 --> 36:35.697
All right.

36:35.698 --> 36:39.067
Now look, even though Ted
is not here in person,

36:39.068 --> 36:43.488
he is here in spirit. It's an heirloom.

36:43.489 --> 36:46.708
- Guard it with your life.
- Okay.

36:52.048 --> 36:54.833
- It's lovely.
- Mm-hm.

36:54.834 --> 36:56.134
You know, when I asked,

36:56.135 --> 36:58.119
I wasn't sure you would have such a thing.

36:58.120 --> 37:01.306
Paige, I heard you
when you said how important

37:01.307 --> 37:03.391
tradition was to you.

37:03.392 --> 37:05.560
And now you've got to know
how important tradition is

37:05.561 --> 37:07.813
to the Roth-Lawson family.

37:07.814 --> 37:09.347
- Tell me about it.
- Yeah.

37:09.348 --> 37:12.651
- No. The ring's history.
- Right.

37:12.652 --> 37:16.521
This belonged to Evan's
great-great-great-grandfather,

37:16.522 --> 37:18.156
Judah P. Roth.

37:18.157 --> 37:20.859
So it's, like, what? From the 1860s?

37:20.860 --> 37:23.161
Exactly. The civil war.

37:23.162 --> 37:26.981
Judah was mortally wounded
at the battle of Gettysburg.

37:26.982 --> 37:28.617
But this ring stayed in your family.

37:28.618 --> 37:31.319
Yes, because Judah was
so worried that his corpse

37:31.320 --> 37:36.208
would be stripped by looters,
he swallowed the ring.

37:36.209 --> 37:38.793
So then when he was
eventually delivered back

37:38.794 --> 37:41.463
to his beloved Victoria,

37:41.464 --> 37:45.183
he knew that she would know
exactly where to find it.

37:45.184 --> 37:47.519
And she did.

37:49.889 --> 37:53.108
That's so romantic. That's...

37:53.109 --> 37:56.061
This is the perfect ring
for me to give Evan.

37:56.062 --> 38:00.448
- Isn't it?
- It's so great.

38:03.686 --> 38:05.537
Oh, uh...

38:05.538 --> 38:07.689
Sorry, I'll be out
of your way in a minute.

38:07.690 --> 38:09.040
No, no, it...

38:10.826 --> 38:12.577
Winnie.

38:12.578 --> 38:15.547
[Sighs]

38:15.548 --> 38:18.366
So this wasn't in the plan.

38:18.367 --> 38:20.919
Wow. Wow. I'm sorry, what are you...

38:20.920 --> 38:23.805
I'm making Paige and Evan's cake.

38:23.806 --> 38:26.541
Evan didn't tell you
because... you know Evan,

38:26.542 --> 38:29.711
he was worried it might be awkward.

38:29.712 --> 38:31.396
- Which it...
- Isn't.

38:31.397 --> 38:33.932
Obviously isn't.

38:33.933 --> 38:35.883
Um, God.

38:35.884 --> 38:38.853
I mean, I didn't know
you and Evan were still...

38:38.854 --> 38:41.489
Oh, come on, you think
I'd let anybody else bake

38:41.490 --> 38:43.408
for the most annoying kid in Passaic?

38:43.409 --> 38:45.160

- Oh, I just met your dad.
- Oh.

38:49.865 --> 38:51.533
After all your stories
in high school when he was

38:51.534 --> 38:56.538
missing in action... I gotta say,
he seemed kind of adorable.

38:56.539 --> 38:57.872
Yeah.

38:57.873 --> 39:00.292
We've actually gotten close.
It's been nice.

39:00.293 --> 39:02.744
Let me guess. Evan initiated the reunion?

39:02.745 --> 39:07.415
- You do know the Lawsons.
- Yeah.

39:07.416 --> 39:09.517
- "Winnie's cakes."
- Mm-hm.

39:09.518 --> 39:12.687
You have your own bakery now.
That's great, really great.

39:12.688 --> 39:15.523
And you look great, too.

39:15.524 --> 39:17.025
That's a lot of greats, Hank.

39:17.026 --> 39:18.526
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:18.527 --> 39:20.111
Yeah, I...

39:20.112 --> 39:21.813
You let Evan know I'll deliver
his masterpiece on Friday.

39:21.814 --> 39:25.450
Of course I will.

39:25.451 --> 39:27.485

a better place than last time.

- I feel terrible about...
- Oh, no.

You don't get to feel terrible.

40:23.209 --> 40:25.210
Please, Winnie, I am so sorry.

40:25.211 --> 40:27.128

40:27.129 --> 40:29.431
and you're here?

40:29.432 --> 40:32.217
Yeah. Um, it wasn't much of a party.

40:32.218 --> 40:33.835

Good for Evan.

- Just let me explain...
- Hank, don't.

40:39.942 --> 40:42.894
Look, we were more than just
high school sweethearts, okay?

40:42.895 --> 40:45.480
You saw me and Evan through a lot.

40:45.481 --> 40:47.649
We were close for a long time off and on.

40:47.650 --> 40:49.784
- Oh, get out.
- I know we were sort of back on

40:49.785 --> 40:51.185
when I met Nikki last fall,

40:51.186 --> 40:52.404
but as soon as I knew
I had feelings for her...

40:52.405 --> 40:55.240
Look, you and your feelings need to go!

40:55.241 --> 40:56.791
Please, Winnie, I just want you...

40:56.792 --> 40:58.243
What? To forgive you?

40:58.244 --> 40:59.544
Make you feel all better for your wedding?

40:59.545 --> 41:02.247
But I won't. So go.

41:02.248 --> 41:05.250
I mean it!

41:07.136 --> 41:08.586
I never meant to... unh!

41:08.587 --> 41:12.424
Aah!

41:28.390 --> 41:30.658
Whoo!

41:30.659 --> 41:32.861
Wow.

41:32.862 --> 41:35.363
- Hey!
- Hey!

41:35.364 --> 41:36.781
There you are.

41:36.782 --> 41:41.402
Don't tell me Evan's
changing the centerpieces again.

41:41.403 --> 41:45.072
Actually, they are for me.

41:45.073 --> 41:46.424
From Rafa.

41:46.425 --> 41:48.960
Rafa's still trying
to get back in your good graces?

41:48.961 --> 41:52.464
- He is back in them.
- Oh.

41:53.682 --> 41:54.916
I know what you're thinking.

41:54.917 --> 41:56.434
I'm thinking you're a smart woman

41:56.435 --> 41:58.019
who can take care of herself
and would never make

41:58.020 --> 41:59.137
the same mistake twice.

41:59.138 --> 42:01.055
So I'm betting Rafa stepped up.

42:01.056 --> 42:05.393
Yeah, he did. In a big way.

42:05.394 --> 42:06.811
There's more, isn't there?

42:10.098 --> 42:14.736
You're ditching me
for the wedding, aren't you?

42:14.737 --> 42:19.073
- You are a mind-reader.
- I knew it! I knew it.

42:19.074 --> 42:22.577
Aw, don't worry, I'll be fine.
I'll dance by myself.

42:22.578 --> 42:26.047
So you can probably
guess my next question.

42:28.283 --> 42:30.051
No.

42:30.052 --> 42:31.252
Are we going to discuss what happened

42:31.253 --> 42:33.454
during Owen's intubation?

42:33.455 --> 42:35.122
Oh, yeah, thank you for stepping in.

42:35.123 --> 42:37.342
You know, my vision was blurry
and I got dizzy.

42:37.343 --> 42:38.960
We both know that you need a head CT.

42:38.961 --> 42:40.628
It was clean after the explosion.

Now let's rule out an intracranial bleed.

I'd like to get it inscribed.

42:48.971 --> 42:50.688
You say this has been
in your family for years?

42:50.689 --> 42:52.157
Not my family.

42:52.158 --> 42:54.826
I didn't think so, Ms. Collins.

42:54.827 --> 42:57.645
- Is something wrong?
- Well, this ring isn't old.

42:57.646 --> 43:00.147
In fact the hallmarks are brand-new.

43:00.148 --> 43:03.952

but this is no heirloom.

54:34.946 --> 54:38.648
It's okay.
Everything's gonna be all right.

54:41.081 --> 54:42.631
Barbie, the blood tests show that you have

54:42.632 --> 54:44.533
Hashimoto's disease.

54:44.534 --> 54:47.202
It's an autoimmune condition
that affects your thyroid,

54:47.203 --> 54:50.723
and one of the symptoms
is intolerance to cold weather.

54:50.724 --> 54:53.092
Hashimoto's.

54:53.093 --> 54:55.060
Is it worse because it's foreign?

54:55.061 --> 54:56.679
Uh, no. No.

54:56.680 --> 54:58.564
And with proper treatment and thyroid meds

54:58.565 --> 55:01.567
and regular thyroid blood tests,
you should be okay.

55:01.568 --> 55:04.737
Well, that's a big relief. What about you?

55:04.738 --> 55:07.222

Oh! No. No, I'm not bored.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.777
Sorry, I just have a headache.

55:11.778 --> 55:14.613
F.Y.I., not good for business
when the doctor looks sick.

55:14.614 --> 55:16.532
- Thank you so much.
- How long is she in here for?

55:16.533 --> 55:19.251
- Could be a few days.
- Oh, I might miss the wedding.

55:19.252 --> 55:21.086
You're gonna stay here with me,
right, Ken?

55:21.087 --> 55:23.789
I would, but it would
be against hospital policy.

55:23.790 --> 55:26.508
You know what? I know most of the nurses.

55:26.509 --> 55:28.627
Yeah, I could pull a few strings
and get you a nice cot,

55:28.628 --> 55:29.878

55:42.225 --> 55:45.311
Okay. Uh, when Evan asked me
to be his best man,

55:45.312 --> 55:47.446
I said, are you doing this
because I'm your only brother,

55:47.447 --> 55:49.281

58:00.396 --> 58:02.831
Never in my wildest dreams

58:02.832 --> 58:04.733
did I imagine that you
could have ended up with

58:04.734 --> 58:06.668
a woman like Nikki, Hank.

58:06.669 --> 58:09.338
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Yes! That's right.

58:09.339 --> 58:12.925
But you've always had ambition,
so... and it serves you.

You're a doctor, right?
You have to have ambition.

58:16.846 --> 58:21.934

I am by your ability

to go back to being my plus one.

get a plus one if we're single.

even though you were
with him for 15 years,

01:00:47.330 --> 01:00:48.697

after dating him for 15 minutes.

01:00:51.951 --> 01:00:54.603

So now you are an authority on love?

01:00:58.942 --> 01:01:01.360
No, but what you did was very impulsive,

01:01:01.361 --> 01:01:02.611
especially for you.

01:01:02.612 --> 01:01:04.730
So you can do what you want to do,

01:01:04.731 --> 01:01:06.198
and you can date who you want to date,

01:01:06.199 --> 01:01:08.734
but I need to remain
predictable and unchanging?

01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:03.655
Hmm. Based on the cerebrospinal fluid leak

for Dr. Rivera on my MRI,

the odds are good, but not 100%.

But it should stop his headaches.

01:02:10.996 --> 01:02:12.464

If there are any objections
to this union, speak now

01:15:56.768 --> 01:16:01.288
or forever hold your peace.

- I need to say something.
- Sure.

01:16:17.756 --> 01:16:22.259
You may have noticed that,
um, it's snowing outside.

01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.478
And this wedding,

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:28.098
like a lot of things in life,

01:16:28.099 --> 01:16:30.434
it's been a test.

01:16:30.435 --> 01:16:33.320
Nothing has gone right.

01:16:33.321 --> 01:16:36.824
Um, and I have tried so hard
to be okay with that,

01:16:36.825 --> 01:16:40.277
I really have.

01:16:40.278 --> 01:16:43.280
Because sometimes in life
you just have to get through

01:16:43.281 --> 01:16:47.317
the bad stuff, so that you
can appreciate the good stuff.

01:16:47.318 --> 01:16:52.005

This wedding,

01:16:58.463 --> 01:16:59.963
it's not what we planned,

01:16:59.964 --> 01:17:04.301
and, um, it's not at all what we wanted.

Paige, it's okay.

01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:10.307

01:17:10.308 --> 01:17:13.393
um...

01:17:13.394 --> 01:17:15.679
But as I look around,

01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.400
I realize now that
it's everything we needed.

01:17:23.321 --> 01:17:27.691
We're surrounded by the people
that we cherish the most.

[Sniffling]

01:17:50.315 --> 01:17:55.319
Because a wedding isn't
about a lot of things,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.489
but it's definitely not about the past.

01:17:58.490 --> 01:18:00.941
It's about the future.

01:18:00.942 --> 01:18:04.077
And I can't wait to see
how you and I reinvent ourselves

01:18:04.078 --> 01:18:08.165
as newlyweds.
