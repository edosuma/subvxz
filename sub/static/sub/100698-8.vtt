00:00.023 --> 00:02.297
Previously, on Siren...

00:03.229 --> 00:04.361
Ooh!

00:04.367 --> 00:05.700
Will you marry me?

00:05.734 --> 00:07.776
Oh, hell, yeah.

00:07.782 --> 00:08.966
What is "marry me"?

00:08.972 --> 00:10.622
When two people love each other

00:10.628 --> 00:13.247
and they want to spend the
rest of their lives together,

00:13.253 --> 00:14.640
they get married.

00:17.545 --> 00:19.046
You've been training, huh?

00:25.433 --> 00:26.766
Yeah.

00:27.122 --> 00:28.488
Something like that.

00:33.057 --> 00:35.157
Donna's spirit keeps visiting me.

00:35.193 --> 00:37.193
Do you know what she wants?

00:39.230 --> 00:40.763
Of course.

00:40.798 --> 00:42.831
She's not at peace.

00:42.867 --> 00:45.034
I was held by the Russian government

00:45.069 --> 00:47.136
for the past ten years.

00:47.171 --> 00:50.169
Another tribe has started
a war in the water.

00:50.196 --> 00:51.896
Their leader will not stop

00:51.931 --> 00:54.165
until every tribe joins her or dies.

00:56.302 --> 00:59.036
You help us, we will help you.

01:02.373 --> 01:04.506

01:14.286 --> 01:16.053

01:16.059 --> 01:17.577

01:18.444 --> 01:21.241

01:22.329 --> 01:24.704

01:32.875 --> 01:34.233

01:40.712 --> 01:41.878
Aah!

01:42.837 --> 01:44.916

02:47.924 --> 02:50.225
That was...

02:51.066 --> 02:52.732
That was different.

02:54.418 --> 02:56.217
Did I hurt you?

02:57.586 --> 02:59.020
Yeah.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.888
Sorry.

03:00.924 --> 03:02.523
No, no.

03:03.105 --> 03:04.572
In a good way.

03:04.789 --> 03:07.028
Like mating in the water.

03:07.539 --> 03:09.939
Maybe it's the stem cells.

03:10.867 --> 03:12.466
They are doing this to you?

03:14.949 --> 03:16.349
I think so.

03:20.043 --> 03:21.763
It's time for more.

03:33.756 --> 03:35.317
Does it hurt?

03:38.061 --> 03:39.326
No.

03:41.230 --> 03:42.662
No, it feels good.

03:48.003 --> 03:50.070
You know, after our swim,

03:50.105 --> 03:52.454
you know, it got me thinking.

03:54.441 --> 03:58.410
You come on land a few
weeks at a time, right?

04:00.582 --> 04:04.784
What if I can stay down there longer?

04:06.222 --> 04:08.088
I mean, like, a lot longer.

04:22.370 --> 04:23.469
Xander.

04:26.130 --> 04:27.864
What's going on?

04:27.870 --> 04:29.737
That's gotta be Tia.

04:31.446 --> 04:33.779
- She's headed north.
- Robb's tribe will fight her.

04:33.814 --> 04:35.748
We will have Maddie call Robb.

04:35.783 --> 04:36.916
Warn them.

04:40.103 --> 04:41.703
Whoo!

04:41.709 --> 04:43.423
Ten centerpieces.

04:43.458 --> 04:45.658
These are carnations.

04:45.693 --> 04:47.427
I ordered ranunculus.

04:47.462 --> 04:48.827
You didn't check?

04:48.863 --> 04:50.229
I thought I did.

04:50.265 --> 04:52.165
Well, return to sender.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.103
Baby, no, no, no, no. We're one day out.

04:55.109 --> 04:56.875
These are so pretty.

04:57.238 --> 04:58.737
Guys, aren't these pretty?

05:00.408 --> 05:01.974
- Beautiful.
- Gorgeous.

05:02.009 --> 05:03.742
Idiots.

05:03.778 --> 05:06.745
Let's get a lady's opinion, hm?

05:06.781 --> 05:08.881
Looks like red seaweed.

05:10.824 --> 05:12.023
Okay, fine.

05:12.029 --> 05:13.095
Going back.

05:18.492 --> 05:21.259
Okay, this Tia situation.

05:21.295 --> 05:23.341
You gotta loop in the
military, like, now.

05:23.347 --> 05:25.148
They will talk to us?

05:25.154 --> 05:28.467
I mean, they already
came looking for Ben.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.469
- When I was gone?
- Yeah.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.904
What did they want?

05:31.939 --> 05:33.405
I don't know, maybe they think

05:33.440 --> 05:35.295
you've got something to do with Kyle.

05:35.301 --> 05:36.400
I mean, he's got all those texts.

05:36.406 --> 05:37.839
Maybe they think I killed him.

05:37.845 --> 05:39.957
Then go clear your name
while you're at it.

05:39.963 --> 05:41.934
No, they're not on our side, Xan.

05:41.940 --> 05:43.152
They never will be.

05:43.158 --> 05:47.819
A hate-filled mermaid is
on a violent rampage, okay?

05:47.854 --> 05:50.221
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

05:50.256 --> 05:52.289
Xander is right.

05:52.325 --> 05:55.359
Hope will live under Tia's
rule if we don't stop her.

05:55.394 --> 05:57.829
We must ask the military for help.

06:00.174 --> 06:01.207
It's her.

06:01.213 --> 06:02.813
No question.

06:06.205 --> 06:08.506
Why would the Russians
sink Canadian ships?

06:08.541 --> 06:10.842
This doesn't have anything
to do with the Russians.

06:10.877 --> 06:12.409
Except that she's one of them.

06:12.445 --> 06:14.311
- What, Russian?
- An operative.

06:14.347 --> 06:17.138
She's like me. From the water.

06:18.985 --> 06:21.152
You didn't know?

06:21.187 --> 06:23.121
What makes you think
that she's an operative?

06:26.225 --> 06:28.126
She got in here undetected.

06:28.161 --> 06:29.860
Accessed secure data.

06:30.246 --> 06:31.912
What kind of data?

06:36.268 --> 06:38.268
Everything she accessed...

06:39.738 --> 06:41.271
Was from our studies of Ryn.

06:43.417 --> 06:44.882
She got onto your network?

06:47.012 --> 06:48.812
We're relocating our
most sensitive research

06:48.847 --> 06:50.480
to a more secure location.

06:50.515 --> 06:52.862
What exactly did she
take from your computers?

06:58.190 --> 06:59.556
She deleted an audio file.

06:59.591 --> 07:03.126
The recording of your echo chamber.

07:04.622 --> 07:06.362
She's getting rid of the antidote.

07:06.398 --> 07:08.398
- We were right.
- About what?

07:08.433 --> 07:10.866
She's going to use the song.

07:10.902 --> 07:14.203
- Use how?
- She recruited many tribes.

07:14.238 --> 07:16.005
They will all sing to people.

07:16.040 --> 07:17.970
They will control their minds.

07:17.976 --> 07:20.774
- On a mass scale.
- And without the recording,

07:20.780 --> 07:22.380
there's no cure.

07:22.386 --> 07:24.046
We need to notify central command.

07:24.082 --> 07:25.547
Yes, sir.

07:25.583 --> 07:28.608
Hey, wait, where are you going?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.987
You've been very helpful.
We'll be in touch.

07:35.059 --> 07:37.292
They have no idea what
they're up against.

07:37.328 --> 07:39.095
Wait.

07:39.130 --> 07:41.197
We already have a weapon
that can protect our coast

07:41.232 --> 07:42.798
if she gets close.

07:42.834 --> 07:44.934
Remember when Klesco
used the sonic cannon?

07:44.969 --> 07:46.836
Your tribe was disoriented.

07:46.871 --> 07:48.437
Some of them got lost. Others died.

07:48.472 --> 07:49.872
That could hurt other marine life.

07:49.907 --> 07:51.940
We'd only use it if she attacks.

07:51.975 --> 07:54.075
Okay, but we'd need to retrieve it,

07:54.111 --> 07:56.025
and she controls those waters now.

07:56.031 --> 07:57.511
I will get it.

07:57.547 --> 07:59.102
What about Hope?

07:59.108 --> 08:01.040
If we use it, it could hurt her.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.220
She is safe.

08:05.255 --> 08:07.822
She's still far away.

08:07.858 --> 08:09.824
We must do it. For her.

08:13.764 --> 08:15.429
_

08:20.070 --> 08:21.669
_

08:22.972 --> 08:25.507
They knew we were coming.

08:25.513 --> 08:28.243
The Silver-Eyeds were ready for us.

08:28.700 --> 08:29.965
Ryn.

08:30.070 --> 08:32.111
She got to them first.

08:32.148 --> 08:34.181
That's why we're here,

08:34.216 --> 08:36.482
to find allies on this
side of the world.

08:36.518 --> 08:39.186
We must gather strength.

08:39.221 --> 08:40.782
Then go back.

08:45.661 --> 08:48.561
They get suspicious when
you do not drink here.

08:57.614 --> 08:58.713
Weak.

08:58.719 --> 09:01.974
This is why we lost.

09:02.010 --> 09:03.843
So, all of them.

09:06.414 --> 09:07.746
Now.

09:10.518 --> 09:13.730
_

09:13.736 --> 09:15.546
_

09:15.552 --> 09:18.648
_

09:24.498 --> 09:25.664
That's mine.

09:28.105 --> 09:30.602
They made my song a weapon.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.137
Who?

09:32.143 --> 09:33.843
The Russians.

09:37.492 --> 09:39.559
Maybe we don't need to go north.

09:50.096 --> 09:52.043
Ten lace tablecloths.

09:52.049 --> 09:54.183
Right. Something borrowed.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.718
Check.

09:55.753 --> 09:58.687
That's not really how
that tradition works,

09:58.723 --> 10:01.356
but I'm glad it checks a box.

10:01.362 --> 10:04.124
Tell Janine some of these
are older than I am,

10:04.130 --> 10:05.496
so be gentle.

10:08.679 --> 10:10.780
What's happening with Donna?

10:10.786 --> 10:13.854
I mean, she still poltergeisting you?

10:14.101 --> 10:17.835
Her spirit won't rest...

10:18.361 --> 10:20.895
Until she's properly
buried in the ocean.

10:23.532 --> 10:27.200
So... so her body is still in that lab?

10:27.235 --> 10:29.102
You see my dilemma.

10:29.137 --> 10:31.104
What are you going to do?

10:31.139 --> 10:32.205
I don't know.

10:32.240 --> 10:34.340
But I'll figure it out.

10:34.376 --> 10:36.809
Don't let me hold you up.
I know you're on the clock.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.623
Yeah, I got to finish this playlist.

10:38.629 --> 10:40.774
Oh, I put a little
Sinatra on there for you.

10:40.780 --> 10:44.247
You need to get people up
out of their chairs, right?

10:44.786 --> 10:46.386
A little pit bull?

10:46.421 --> 10:48.254
Some Kesha?

10:48.290 --> 10:49.688
- Kesha?
- Kesha.

10:51.259 --> 10:54.027
Okay. That's not what I
pegged you for, but...

10:54.062 --> 10:56.429
Never underestimate a higher life form.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.234
Oh, my God. Seriously?

11:02.269 --> 11:03.835
I'm so glad you're all okay.

11:05.872 --> 11:08.139
Robb? Robb?

11:11.946 --> 11:13.979
- Lost him.
- What happened?

11:14.014 --> 11:15.513
There was a battle.

11:15.549 --> 11:16.815
With Tia's army?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.984
But Robb's tribe fought. And won.

11:19.019 --> 11:20.919
This is good.

11:20.955 --> 11:23.322
It's great. It means they're vulnerable.

11:23.357 --> 11:25.723
It also means she knows we're
all in this together now.

11:27.928 --> 11:30.495
She'll probably be heading back here.

11:42.448 --> 11:44.041
What else can I do?

11:44.077 --> 11:46.945
Remind me never to get married again.

11:46.980 --> 11:50.715
Believe me, me and my future
ex-wife are eloping to Vegas.

11:57.757 --> 11:59.123
Chris?

11:59.158 --> 12:00.758
Hey, Xan.

12:00.794 --> 12:02.627
Hey. Is everything okay?

12:02.662 --> 12:06.097
Look, man, I didn't
know who else to call.

12:06.132 --> 12:07.431
What's going on?

12:07.467 --> 12:10.868
They're shutting this place down.

12:10.903 --> 12:13.637
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

12:13.672 --> 12:15.606
I got to move out.

12:15.641 --> 12:17.975
I don't know if I can do
this on my own, you know?

12:19.278 --> 12:20.611
Okay, when?

12:20.646 --> 12:21.945
Today.

12:21.981 --> 12:24.315
Today? Like, "today," today?

12:24.350 --> 12:26.083
Yeah.

12:26.119 --> 12:27.751
Can you come get me?

12:27.786 --> 12:31.655
Dude, Calvin is getting
married, like, tomorrow.

12:35.161 --> 12:36.793
You know what?

12:36.829 --> 12:38.996
Yeah. I'll be there.

12:39.032 --> 12:40.998
Look, I really appreciate it, man.

12:41.690 --> 12:43.156
Yeah.

12:49.586 --> 12:51.682
This is where the cannon fell.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.911
I'm ready.

12:52.917 --> 12:55.111
We'll watch the sonar
for activity nearby.

12:55.147 --> 12:56.979
But please be careful.

12:57.015 --> 12:59.482
- We don't know where Tia is.
- Okay, yes.

13:03.821 --> 13:05.295
You'll be okay?

13:05.301 --> 13:06.889
I'm very fast.

13:06.925 --> 13:10.260
If we see anything, I'll come in.

13:28.912 --> 13:30.985
_

13:32.216 --> 13:34.317
I can't believe it's you.

13:34.323 --> 13:36.017
Believe it.

13:36.053 --> 13:38.220
I waited for your call.
I thought you were dead.

13:38.255 --> 13:40.479
I worried they would be monitoring you.

13:40.630 --> 13:42.964
They never suspected me.

13:43.588 --> 13:45.560
How do they think I got out?

13:45.566 --> 13:48.029
They think it was Alexei.

13:48.065 --> 13:51.266
The one who cut your song out of you.

13:55.552 --> 13:57.622
You were the only one who cared.

13:58.775 --> 14:00.675
What do they do to a man

14:00.711 --> 14:02.477
who they think helped a mermaid escape?

14:02.483 --> 14:05.550
Work him 20 hours a day,
like a gulag inmate.

14:05.556 --> 14:07.056
Watch his every move.

14:08.785 --> 14:10.551
Then they mustn't learn about you.

14:14.835 --> 14:16.524
Meet me upstairs in an hour.

15:00.186 --> 15:02.486
- You see anything?
- Not much.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.613
How fast do you think
Tia's army could get here?

15:06.141 --> 15:09.042
Depends how badly she was beaten.

15:10.898 --> 15:12.564
Robb really came through.

15:16.651 --> 15:18.985
- Shit. There's something here.
- What? was it one of them?

15:19.020 --> 15:21.253
It's alone. Maybe it's a guard?

15:24.440 --> 15:27.178
- I'm going in.
- Be careful.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.310
Ben!

16:26.243 --> 16:29.076
You guys are really closing
up shop in a hurry, huh?

16:29.112 --> 16:31.178
- Where's the fire?
- There's no fire.

16:31.214 --> 16:34.681
- Yeah, of course not.
- When Uncle Sam says go, we go.

16:34.717 --> 16:36.083
Plain and simple.

16:36.516 --> 16:38.634
Used to date a girl who worked here.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.773
Nothing she said was
ever plain or simple.

17:11.653 --> 17:13.153
Chris.

17:13.351 --> 17:14.650
Hey, man.

17:16.191 --> 17:18.925
- You came.
- Yeah, I told you I would.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.925
Dr. Katz wants to see
you before you leave.

17:20.932 --> 17:22.319
To go over your meds.

17:28.103 --> 17:30.069
They always lock you in like that,

17:30.105 --> 17:33.106
or are they just keeping
me out of trouble?

17:34.776 --> 17:36.573
I actually don't know.

17:38.279 --> 17:41.313
I'm just glad you're coming home, man.

17:41.616 --> 17:43.516
This place really creeps me out.

17:43.551 --> 17:45.584
Yeah.

17:45.620 --> 17:46.953
Yeah.

18:31.899 --> 18:34.499
You can stay with me at my
mom's house for a little while,

18:34.534 --> 18:38.036
and maybe we can get you back
out on a boat at some point.

18:38.072 --> 18:40.906
Yeah, I don't think anyone's
going to want to hire me.

18:40.941 --> 18:42.707
Of course they will.

18:42.743 --> 18:45.143
Hey, look, a bunch of guys will
be at the wedding tomorrow.

18:45.179 --> 18:47.246
There's nothing like an
open bar to remind the guys

18:47.281 --> 18:48.881
that you're still a fisherman.

18:48.916 --> 18:52.317
So who's getting married?

18:52.642 --> 18:53.740
Calvin.

18:55.044 --> 18:56.743
And Janine?

18:56.991 --> 18:58.257
Right.

18:59.731 --> 19:01.031
Hey.

19:01.689 --> 19:02.888
We'll figure it out.

19:02.894 --> 19:04.426
All right?

19:06.966 --> 19:08.099
Yeah.

19:26.887 --> 19:28.219
Are you okay?

19:28.254 --> 19:29.621
Yes.

19:29.656 --> 19:31.355
Ben, how did you do that?

19:31.391 --> 19:34.425
You were down there almost
15 minutes with no air tank.

19:39.415 --> 19:40.747
Ben, what is it?

19:40.753 --> 19:42.320
Ben?

19:44.303 --> 19:45.866
Ben?

19:52.515 --> 19:54.448
- Ben!
- Ben!

19:54.454 --> 19:56.535
He can't breathe. Help me turn him.

20:13.465 --> 20:15.531
I'm okay.

20:16.174 --> 20:17.700
What did you do?

20:26.977 --> 20:28.915
Were you trying to become one?

20:28.921 --> 20:30.521
No.

20:30.527 --> 20:31.926
I don't know.

20:31.932 --> 20:33.808
And, Ryn, you knew about this?

20:33.814 --> 20:36.117
- I thought it was good.
- You could've died.

20:36.153 --> 20:38.742
Nothing bad happened to
my mom when she took them.

20:38.748 --> 20:41.189
That was a last resort
to keep her alive.

20:41.224 --> 20:43.792
- Ryn, you need to see a doctor.
- Maddie...

20:43.827 --> 20:46.190
We don't know what could be
happening inside you now.

20:46.196 --> 20:48.129
How would I explain what happened?

20:49.401 --> 20:51.599
Listen, I'll take care of it, okay?

20:51.826 --> 20:54.559
Now, we need to fix the cannon.

20:54.565 --> 20:56.236
Tia could be here soon.

20:56.272 --> 20:57.537
Yeah. I'll fix it.

20:57.572 --> 20:58.772
You need to go home now,

20:58.808 --> 21:00.387
and you need to swear to me

21:00.393 --> 21:02.026
you'll get rid of those cells.

21:04.146 --> 21:05.445
Okay.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.250
I will go with Ben.

21:10.286 --> 21:12.163
You two alone is what got us into this

21:12.169 --> 21:13.693
in the first place.

21:15.778 --> 21:18.580
I'll make sure he's okay.

21:20.416 --> 21:21.882
I promise.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.000
Please.

21:27.336 --> 21:28.802
You have to stop.

21:35.844 --> 21:38.411
All right, look like we're close.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.210
Whoa! Hey, dude. What's the hurry?

21:41.216 --> 21:43.415
It's not like there's
a fire and all, right?

21:43.544 --> 21:44.743
Doc's ready.

21:48.457 --> 21:49.556
I'll be here.

22:27.194 --> 22:29.395
I've dreamed of this
since I came to Berzin.

22:29.430 --> 22:30.596
Me too.

22:31.899 --> 22:33.781
If only I could sing to you.

22:39.907 --> 22:43.108
Did they figure out how to
use my song after I left?

22:44.911 --> 22:46.544
It's okay. You can tell me.

22:46.579 --> 22:48.579
I won't be angry with you.

22:48.615 --> 22:50.481
Yes.

22:50.517 --> 22:52.607
Alexei made a weapon from it.

22:54.020 --> 22:56.353
Those 20-hour days paid off.

22:56.389 --> 22:57.988
I'm sorry.

22:58.024 --> 23:00.124
I would have stopped them if I could.

23:03.396 --> 23:04.495
I know.

23:09.936 --> 23:11.436
I believe you.

23:15.842 --> 23:18.642
But what use are you if you can't?

24:04.822 --> 24:07.222
You all good with the meds?

24:07.228 --> 24:08.424
Finish packing.

24:08.460 --> 24:10.478
All right, we're all set now.

24:10.484 --> 24:11.616
Yeah, Chris?

24:12.464 --> 24:14.364
There you go.

24:14.399 --> 24:18.375
When Uncle Sam says go, we go.

24:19.170 --> 24:20.870
You want to give us a hand?

24:35.779 --> 24:37.512
Ryn, Ryn, what are you doing?

24:37.518 --> 24:39.518
- Getting rid of them.
- Hey, hey. No, no.

24:39.524 --> 24:41.256
- Ryn, wait. Not now.
- They hurt you.

24:41.291 --> 24:43.792
- I promised Maddie.
- I'm fine now.

24:46.927 --> 24:48.226
See?

24:48.232 --> 24:51.099
Just like you, after you transform.

24:51.135 --> 24:53.035
It was painful at first,

24:53.334 --> 24:54.967
but now I'm fine now.

24:54.973 --> 24:56.739
I don't understand.

24:57.118 --> 25:00.119
One day, you're not going
to be able to transform.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.152
You'll have to stay
in the water for good.

25:07.206 --> 25:08.238
Please.

25:09.386 --> 25:10.919
We need those.

25:15.725 --> 25:16.824
What is it?

25:16.860 --> 25:18.527
I went to go get Chris,

25:18.562 --> 25:21.729
and I found something at the facility.

25:22.053 --> 25:23.553
Oh, Xander.

25:24.954 --> 25:27.555
It isn't Donna?

25:27.637 --> 25:29.538
I hope so.

25:29.573 --> 25:32.207
Otherwise I just violated,
like, nine federal laws.

25:33.544 --> 25:35.610
Oh, and just in case

25:36.309 --> 25:38.543
these were haunting you too...

25:39.825 --> 25:40.992
What?

25:40.998 --> 25:42.865
That's your family.

25:42.871 --> 25:44.318
From the graveyard.

25:44.353 --> 25:45.720
Oh, my God.

25:50.945 --> 25:53.363
I don't know how you did it,

25:54.263 --> 25:56.074
but you're a genius.

25:56.633 --> 25:58.365
Oh, and a very good friend.

26:03.073 --> 26:06.407
Yeah, that's not too bad
for a lower life form, huh?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.140
Not bad at all.

26:11.914 --> 26:14.247
It will be a long time.

26:14.282 --> 26:16.617
It took Robb many
years to stop changing.

26:16.652 --> 26:18.451
We don't know how long it'll be for you.

26:19.103 --> 26:20.536
It could be tomorrow.

26:22.524 --> 26:24.680
Look, I know it sounds crazy,

26:24.686 --> 26:27.520
but maybe I could go back with you.

26:29.031 --> 26:30.931
Live with me?

26:30.966 --> 26:32.799
I don't know.

26:32.835 --> 26:33.934
Maybe.

26:35.671 --> 26:36.970
Ben...

26:37.006 --> 26:40.206
Maybe I was just doing them too fast.

26:41.653 --> 26:43.409
What if I slow down?

26:46.407 --> 26:47.773
It's too dangerous.

26:48.283 --> 26:50.213
It's our only chance.

26:50.588 --> 26:52.097
No.

26:53.522 --> 26:56.022
Water isn't the only way.

26:57.259 --> 26:58.818
What do you mean?

27:00.762 --> 27:02.061
I will live on land.

27:02.096 --> 27:03.353
With you.

27:03.359 --> 27:04.825
On land?

27:04.831 --> 27:06.732
You mean, stay human?

27:06.768 --> 27:09.935
Yes. Here. Together.

27:10.518 --> 27:11.718
Human.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.389
What about Hope?

27:15.309 --> 27:17.109
She can be with us.

27:18.412 --> 27:20.345
As a family.

27:23.234 --> 27:24.983
I can't ask you to do that.

27:24.989 --> 27:26.655
It is my choice.

27:29.424 --> 27:30.922
When it is time...

27:33.194 --> 27:35.077
I will be human with you.

27:38.164 --> 27:40.064
Okay.

28:02.559 --> 28:04.389
Why didn't you tell me sooner

28:04.395 --> 28:06.761
that my sister was not at peace?

28:07.047 --> 28:10.181
You're dealing with so much right now.

28:10.216 --> 28:13.450
I wanted to bring you solutions,

28:13.486 --> 28:14.919
not more problems.

28:19.024 --> 28:20.524
Thank you.

28:34.507 --> 28:37.441
Before you take her to the water,

28:37.476 --> 28:39.177
do you want to say something?

28:49.624 --> 28:53.592
My mother and I had a
special place in the water.

28:53.926 --> 28:57.494
The last time I saw her, we went there.

28:58.765 --> 29:00.865
We hunted.

29:01.166 --> 29:02.466
Mother.

29:02.501 --> 29:04.387
Daughter.

29:04.533 --> 29:06.767
Together.

29:06.951 --> 29:10.019
Now, we will bring her back home.

29:22.532 --> 29:25.567
She belongs in the water.

29:26.383 --> 29:27.548
With you.

29:40.873 --> 29:44.540
This is officially a cell
phone-free zone, folks.

29:44.576 --> 29:46.877
Okay? Not silenced, off.

29:46.912 --> 29:50.446
Okay? So says our favorite
bride on her big day.

29:50.482 --> 29:51.847
Hey.

29:54.094 --> 29:55.800
- Hey, Jerry.
- Hey, Maddie.

29:55.806 --> 29:57.373
Good luck officiating.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.222
Oh, uh, no phones at
the party either, okay?

30:00.258 --> 30:02.224
Janine wants us fully present.

30:03.895 --> 30:06.296
Yeah, I got the cannon set
up, just off the MRC docks.

30:06.331 --> 30:08.063
You talk to your fisherman buddies?

30:08.099 --> 30:10.900
Oh, yeah. Any unusually
large fish migrations,

30:10.935 --> 30:12.868
they know to call me.

30:12.904 --> 30:14.570
All our cell phones are gonna be off.

30:14.606 --> 30:16.071
Oh, not mine. Vibrate.

30:16.107 --> 30:17.740
You're risking Janine's wrath?

30:17.776 --> 30:19.641
Yeah, I can take her.

30:19.677 --> 30:22.758
Speaking of which, I'd better go.

30:23.580 --> 30:25.013
Hi.

30:25.048 --> 30:26.315
You made it.

30:27.002 --> 30:28.850
I was worried. How's Ben?

30:28.885 --> 30:30.084
Better.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.620
We got rid of the cells.

30:31.655 --> 30:33.888
Thank you. I knew he'd listen to you.

30:34.240 --> 30:35.651
Welcome, everyone.

30:35.657 --> 30:37.393
Thanks for coming. If you
could be seated, please.

30:37.399 --> 30:38.880
What does this song mean?

30:38.886 --> 30:40.900
The wedding's starting soon.

30:40.931 --> 30:42.931
And if Tia comes?

30:42.966 --> 30:44.566
The cannon's ready.

30:45.242 --> 30:47.135
Here. I'll find a seat.

30:47.170 --> 30:48.704
You wait for Ben?

30:48.739 --> 30:49.838
Okay. Yes.

30:54.524 --> 30:56.070
Hey, you made it.

30:59.615 --> 31:01.349
That's a nice three-piece.

31:01.384 --> 31:03.584
It's Calvin's wedding Of course.

31:03.619 --> 31:06.454
You know, I try not to miss
the possibility of a shit show.

31:07.923 --> 31:09.089
Helen.

31:09.124 --> 31:10.920
Why, it's great to see you.

31:10.926 --> 31:12.508
You too, Chris.

31:12.514 --> 31:14.848
- Hey, hi.
- Hey.

31:14.854 --> 31:17.609
There's some guys over there I
should probably go say hi to.

31:17.615 --> 31:18.814
Excuse me.

31:22.872 --> 31:25.239
Twenty-four hours and he's
already in fighting shape.

31:25.274 --> 31:27.007
I'll have what he's having.

31:28.844 --> 31:30.377
Maybe what he's not having.

31:31.816 --> 31:34.249
Donna's song made him sick, right?

31:34.449 --> 31:35.782
So?

31:35.817 --> 31:39.119
Maybe when we laid her to rest,

31:39.154 --> 31:40.954
he broke free from it.

31:40.990 --> 31:43.023
Did you get that in one of your books?

31:43.058 --> 31:44.958
You have a better theory?

31:44.994 --> 31:46.499
You made it.

31:46.735 --> 31:48.702
How was this morning?

31:48.708 --> 31:50.241
She's at peace now.

31:50.532 --> 31:51.798
In the water.

32:11.522 --> 32:14.220
- You look amazing.
- You look sober.

32:15.667 --> 32:16.933
You are sober, right?

32:16.939 --> 32:18.429
Yeah.

32:18.502 --> 32:20.435
We can be seated.

32:24.399 --> 32:26.065
Calvin and Janine

32:26.100 --> 32:28.634
are here to declare their
love for each other.

32:28.669 --> 32:31.637
And we are here to
commit to helping them

32:31.672 --> 32:33.806
make it last a lifetime.

32:33.841 --> 32:35.741
I asked some of your loved ones

32:35.776 --> 32:37.676
for tips on how marriages survive.

32:37.711 --> 32:41.246
Janine's grandmother says
it was Schnapps with dinner.

32:41.281 --> 32:43.682
And often with lunch.

32:43.717 --> 32:46.384
Calvin's dad reports that he
had to learn that marriage

32:46.420 --> 32:48.258
isn't about winning arguments.

32:48.264 --> 32:50.823
It's about losing arguments to
a woman much smarter than you.

32:52.359 --> 32:54.178
Janine's sister's advice...

32:54.184 --> 32:55.894
Ahem, um, I won't go there.

32:57.498 --> 33:00.664
Today, Calvin and Janine
are tying the knot.

33:00.670 --> 33:02.835
But their relationship
began when someone

33:02.870 --> 33:04.536
forgot to tie the damn knot.

33:04.572 --> 33:08.072
I was there the day that Janine
walked out onto the dock,

33:08.107 --> 33:11.308
and this young seadog was so smitten

33:11.344 --> 33:14.244
that he forgot to tie
off the North Star.

33:14.280 --> 33:17.682
So Calvin had to dive into the harbor.

33:17.717 --> 33:19.746
Is that a meet-cute, or what?

33:24.524 --> 33:26.791
One of their first dates was karaoke.

33:26.826 --> 33:28.292
You're still not allowed

33:28.327 --> 33:30.194
to sing "Sweet Caroline"
in Pruitt County

33:30.229 --> 33:32.860
after the hatchet job
Janine did to it that night.

33:44.776 --> 33:47.878
When these two are
together, it's laughter.

33:47.913 --> 33:49.113
Fun.

33:49.148 --> 33:50.580
It's love.

33:50.616 --> 33:52.216
And they share it with us.

33:52.251 --> 33:54.120
They bring us together.

33:58.824 --> 34:00.357
Ryn. Ryn, stop!

34:04.230 --> 34:05.329
Ryn!

34:12.437 --> 34:14.103
You can die.

34:14.938 --> 34:17.206
What you did was wrong.

34:17.242 --> 34:19.308
Don't you see that?

34:19.344 --> 34:21.545
And with that,

34:21.551 --> 34:24.080
Calvin, if you will put
this on Janine's finger

34:24.114 --> 34:26.114
and repeat after me.

34:30.789 --> 34:33.255
In sickness and in health.

34:33.291 --> 34:35.158
Till death do us part.

34:35.193 --> 34:37.043
By the power vested in me

34:37.050 --> 34:38.858
by www.ordainme.net,

34:38.864 --> 34:40.429
the great state of Washington,

34:40.465 --> 34:41.931
and Neptune, king of the oceans,

34:41.967 --> 34:44.300
I now pronounce you...

34:44.335 --> 34:46.368
Husband and wife.

35:06.968 --> 35:08.468
How are you holding up?

35:08.474 --> 35:11.308
Open bar heals all wounds.

35:17.978 --> 35:20.612
You ever think about
what's going to happen

35:20.647 --> 35:22.781
when Ryn has to go back one day?

35:23.207 --> 35:25.107
For good?

35:27.521 --> 35:29.354
That's what this was all about?

35:31.958 --> 35:34.292
She said she'd stay on land for me.

35:38.065 --> 35:40.966
Can't let her do that, can I?

35:44.739 --> 35:46.404
Would you want that?

35:56.250 --> 35:58.366
There's yours.

35:59.286 --> 36:01.286
It tells you where to sit.

36:01.321 --> 36:03.087
And there's mine.

36:03.513 --> 36:05.579
We're at the same table.

36:06.092 --> 36:07.692
Yours is only one name.

36:08.430 --> 36:11.831
My date couldn't make it, unfortunately.

36:13.898 --> 36:16.799
Humans think you're apart from someone

36:16.810 --> 36:19.738
just because they're
physically not with you.

36:20.389 --> 36:23.190
But we know, don't we?

36:26.001 --> 36:27.500
All right, everyone!

36:27.506 --> 36:28.875
Can we gather around the dance floor?

36:28.881 --> 36:30.614
Oh, what are they up to?

36:30.650 --> 36:33.016
All right, now before we
get all crazy out here,

36:33.051 --> 36:34.667
and believe me, we will,

36:34.673 --> 36:37.527
we just wanted to slow
things down for the bride...

36:38.924 --> 36:40.123
And groom

36:40.159 --> 36:41.425
to have their first dance.
