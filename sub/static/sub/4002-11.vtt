11:26.083 --> 11:27.333
GEORGE KING.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.250
THE NICARAGUAN EMBASSY IS STILL
GIVING ME THE RUNAROUND.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.250
RAMOS.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.250
GO THERE IN PERSON.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.625
UNTIL WE KNOW
KING'S TRUE IDENTITY,

11:33.625 --> 11:34.709
THERE'S NOT MUCH TO GO ON.

11:34.709 --> 11:36.417
AND FINALLY,

11:36.417 --> 11:38.625
ANTON BRIGGS
IS COMING IN TODAY

11:38.625 --> 11:39.792
TO GO OVER HIS STATEMENT.

11:39.792 --> 11:42.208
TODAY?

11:42.208 --> 11:43.291
WHAT'S THE MATTER,
YOU FORGET YOUR LIP GLOSS?

11:43.291 --> 11:45.041
(Batista)
QUINN.

11:45.041 --> 11:46.250
I WANT YOU TO STAY CLEAR.

11:46.250 --> 11:48.041
NO MORE SPARRING.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.417
AND, MORGAN,
I KNOW HE'S YOUR INFORMANT,

11:49.417 --> 11:51.000
BUT I WANNA COVER IT.

11:51.000 --> 11:53.333
GET MYSELF UP TO SPEED
WITH THE CASE.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.875
ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE.

11:54.875 --> 11:56.041
THAT'S IT.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.250
GO, CATCH BAD GUYS.

11:58.250 --> 11:59.583
FUCK YOU, LIP GLOSS.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.875
NO UNUSUAL ACTIVITY?

12:04.875 --> 12:08.125
THERE WAS SOME DOUCHEBAG
WITH HIS HIGH BEAMS ON,

12:08.125 --> 12:09.834
BLINDING ME.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.458
ACTUALLY,
IT WASN'T HIGH BEAMS.

12:15.458 --> 12:17.709
IT WAS THOSE
BIG-ASS HALOGENS.

12:17.709 --> 12:19.458
WHAT KIND OF CAR?

12:19.458 --> 12:21.291
SUV.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.375
DARK, BLUE...BLACK.

12:24.375 --> 12:26.375
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

12:26.375 --> 12:29.417
[tape stops]

12:55.208 --> 12:58.208
HOLA,  MIGUEL.

12:58.208 --> 13:00.458
MMM, ASI, ASI.

13:00.458 --> 13:06.291
YEAH, LISTEN, AFTER THAT SCENE
WITH SYL THE OTHER NIGHT,

13:06.291 --> 13:09.542
I THINK WE SHOULD TALK.

13:13.208 --> 13:14.750
THAT'S GREAT.

13:14.750 --> 13:16.625
GET A 20 ON ANTON BRIGGS.

13:16.625 --> 13:19.291
HAVE HIS UNI WATCHDOGS
BRING HIM IN.

13:19.291 --> 13:20.333
HEY.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.542
HEY.

13:22.542 --> 13:24.458
YOU ALWAYS LOOK
SO HAPPY TO SEE ME.

13:24.458 --> 13:25.291
IT'S 'CAUSE
I ALWAYS AM.

13:25.291 --> 13:27.417
I BROUGHT YOU THESE.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.792
ITALIAN HANGOVER REMEDIES

13:29.792 --> 13:31.500
PERFECTED BY CENTURIES

13:31.500 --> 13:34.250
OF OVER-INDULGING
ANCESTORS.

13:34.250 --> 13:36.333
THERE'S SAFFRON LEMON RISOTTO,
WHITE PIZZA,

13:36.333 --> 13:39.834
CAYENNE TEA.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.625
SOUNDS GREAT.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.125
BUT I'M NOT HUNG-OVER.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.709
I BEHAVED MYSELF LAST NIGHT.

13:46.709 --> 13:48.792
I'M A PLUS-ONE NOW,
REMEMBER?

13:48.792 --> 13:52.250
STILL, MAN HAS HIS NEEDS.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.458
TRUST ME.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.500
MY NEEDS ARE COVERED.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.917
(Harry)
COLD FEET?

14:03.917 --> 14:07.333
WHAT?

14:07.333 --> 14:09.166
NO, RITA'S GREAT.

14:09.166 --> 14:12.000
GETTING MARRIED'S EASY,
DEX.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SHOW UP.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.500
BUT KILLING MIGUEL PRADO?

14:20.667 --> 14:22.166
THAT'LL REQUIRE SOME FINESSE.

14:24.208 --> 14:26.041
HE'S A PUBLIC FIGURE.

14:26.041 --> 14:27.208
WELL CONNECTED.

14:27.208 --> 14:28.375
DAD, I GOT IT.

14:28.375 --> 14:30.333
MIGUEL DIES,
PEOPLE NOTICE.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.709
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T
JUST MAKE HIM DISAPPEAR.

14:32.709 --> 14:34.208
SO I'LL PIN IT
ON SOMEONE ELSE.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.667
HOW ABOUT YOUR TIMELINE?

14:39.667 --> 14:40.750
DEFINITELY
AFTER THE WEDDING.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.417
IT'D BE CRAZY
TO DO IT ANY SOONER.

14:42.417 --> 14:43.875
AND AN ALIBI?

14:43.875 --> 14:45.542
THE WEDDING NIGHT.

14:47.709 --> 14:49.750
RITA'S PREGNANT, EXHAUSTED.

14:49.750 --> 14:51.625
AFTER OUR WEDDING
AND A GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE,

14:51.625 --> 14:53.625
SHE'LL BE OUT LIKE A LIGHT.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.834
UNLESS SHE WAKES UP
AND YOU'RE NOT THERE.

14:55.834 --> 14:57.500
THAT IS NOT THE WAY
YOU WANT HER

14:57.500 --> 14:58.875
TO REMEMBER
YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.

15:03.959 --> 15:05.000
ARE YOU HIDING
OR SOMETHING?

15:07.542 --> 15:08.542
ANTON WILL BE HERE
IN A MINUTE.

15:08.542 --> 15:10.166
I DON'T WANNA SEE HIM.

15:10.166 --> 15:11.834
I KNOW IT'S REAL MATURE,

15:11.834 --> 15:13.500
BUT IF I SEE HIM,
I'LL JUST MISS HIM.

15:15.375 --> 15:16.542
SO TELL HIM.

15:16.542 --> 15:18.250
I CAN'T.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.166
I NEED TO BE WITH SOMEBODY
WHO'S GOT HIS SHIT TOGETHER.

15:22.166 --> 15:23.542
SOMEBODY WITH A REAL JOB.

15:23.542 --> 15:26.375
SOMEBODY WITH STRONG MORALS.

15:26.375 --> 15:28.208
SOMEBODY LIKE DAD.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.667
DAD WASN'T PERFECT, DEB.

15:31.667 --> 15:35.542
YEAH, WELL,
HE WASN'T A DRUG USER OR A C.I.

15:35.542 --> 15:37.208
WELL, ANTON'S NOT A C.I.

15:37.208 --> 15:40.208
DAD STILL WOULDN'T APPROVE.

15:40.208 --> 15:43.417
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

15:45.750 --> 15:47.250
WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED
TO MEAN?

15:47.250 --> 15:49.250
NOTHING.

15:49.250 --> 15:51.125
SOMETHING.

15:51.125 --> 15:54.250
YOU'VE HAD A BUG UP YOUR ASS
ABOUT DAD FOR MONTHS NOW.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.291
WHAT DID HE DO?

15:58.583 --> 16:00.083
YOU DON'T WANNA KNOW.

16:03.792 --> 16:05.208
NO, I REALLY DO.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.667
[sighs]

16:07.667 --> 16:10.709
HE WASN'T ON THE TAKE.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.375
HE DIDN'T BREAK ANY LAWS.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.625
HE DIDN'T CHEAT ON MOM.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.667
BULLSHIT.

16:30.667 --> 16:35.041
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:35.041 --> 16:37.333
BULLSHIT!

16:37.333 --> 16:38.917
WHO?

16:46.375 --> 16:48.125
A C.I.

16:54.834 --> 16:58.583
YOU ALWAYS WANTED TO BE
LIKE DAD.

16:58.583 --> 17:01.959
SERIOUSLY?

17:13.750 --> 17:16.667
ANTON IS HERE
TO GO OVER HIS STATEMENT...

17:16.667 --> 17:17.834
WITH YOU.

17:17.834 --> 17:19.542
I THOUGHT YOU
WERE COVERING THIS.

17:19.542 --> 17:20.834
I WAS.

17:20.834 --> 17:25.834
BUT YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
HE TRUSTS.

17:25.834 --> 17:26.750
WELL, IT'S REALLY HARD
TO FIND PEOPLE

17:26.750 --> 17:27.875
THAT YOU TRUST THESE DAYS.

17:27.875 --> 17:29.375
DEB.

17:29.375 --> 17:30.583
BLOW ME.

17:33.166 --> 17:34.875
MY SISTER NEVER SAYS THAT.

17:42.625 --> 17:44.250
[whispers]
OOPS.

17:55.333 --> 17:56.500
[door opens]

18:05.875 --> 18:07.625
SHIT, THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

18:07.625 --> 18:09.709
SEND IN THE OTHER GUY.

18:09.709 --> 18:11.709
WHAT?

18:11.709 --> 18:13.250
[exhales deeply]

18:13.250 --> 18:15.333
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR
YOU DON'T WANNA BE HERE.

18:15.333 --> 18:18.583
I'M...SORRY.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.083
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU.

18:22.417 --> 18:24.750
I MEAN,
IT'S ABOUT YOU.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.959
IT'S JUST...

18:26.959 --> 18:30.083
SOMETHING ELSE
JUST HAPPENED.

18:31.917 --> 18:33.208
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:35.250 --> 18:36.542
NO.

18:38.583 --> 18:40.041
CAN I HELP?

18:44.875 --> 18:46.166
YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS AND SEE

18:46.166 --> 18:48.041
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT YOU WANNA CHANGE OR ADD--

18:48.041 --> 18:49.333
YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.959
RIGHT NOW
I REALLY NEED IT TO BE.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.125
[breathes deeply]

19:11.875 --> 19:14.166
[scoffs]

19:14.166 --> 19:15.917
WHAT?

19:17.750 --> 19:20.083
IS THERE A MISTAKE?

19:22.959 --> 19:24.792
NO.

19:24.792 --> 19:27.000
IT'S JUST, UM...

19:27.000 --> 19:32.500
THESE WORDS,
THEY DON'T REALLY SAY IT.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.959
YOU KNOW,
WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

19:35.959 --> 19:38.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:42.000 --> 19:46.291
DEBRA, I COULD HEAR IT,
YOU KNOW?

19:49.458 --> 19:55.000
THE SOUND...
OF THE BLADE CUTTING INTO ME.

19:58.834 --> 20:03.125
THAT AND, UH,
THE SOUND OF ME SCREAMING.

20:05.917 --> 20:11.000
LIKE IT WAS SOMEBODY ELSE.

20:11.000 --> 20:13.834
AND I REMEMBER THINKING,

20:13.834 --> 20:18.667
"THAT GUY SCREAMING...

20:21.542 --> 20:23.834
HE'S GONNA DIE."

20:30.542 --> 20:31.917
[sighs]

20:34.000 --> 20:39.291
BUT, UM, THEN HE JUST STOPPED.

20:39.291 --> 20:41.750
WHY?

20:41.750 --> 20:45.667
TO GO THROUGH MY POCKETS.

20:45.667 --> 20:48.458
HE TOOK MY WALLET
AND MY CELL PHONE.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.709
COCKSUCKER EVEN TOOK
MY CHANGE.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.917
YOUR CHANGE?

20:56.750 --> 20:58.583
HOW FUCKED UP IS THAT?

21:18.417 --> 21:20.333
HE GIVE YOU ANYTHING?

21:20.333 --> 21:22.083
NOTHING WE CAN USE.

21:22.083 --> 21:23.208
SURE,
WE'LL WALK THE CRIME SCENE.

21:23.208 --> 21:24.500
SEE IF THERE'S
ANYTHING WE MISSED.

21:24.500 --> 21:27.083
WHATEVER IT TAKES
TO FUCKING CATCH THIS GUY.

21:30.417 --> 21:33.083
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
NOT FREEZING SPERM IN THERE.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.458
THIS ONLY GETS DOWN
TO MINUS 40 DEGREES CENTIGRADE.

21:38.458 --> 21:41.333
FREEZING SPERM REQUIRES A VESSEL
TO BE AT LEAST MINUS 200.

21:43.083 --> 21:44.458
WHAT?

21:44.458 --> 21:45.959
I'M A DONOR.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.583
IT'S MY WAY OF GIVING BACK.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.125
GOD HELP THE CHILDREN.

21:49.125 --> 21:53.083
HEY, UM,
IS THE, UH, SERVER DOWN?

21:53.083 --> 21:54.166
WHY, WHAT DO YOU NEED?

21:54.166 --> 21:56.875
UM, I WANTED TO RUN
A BACKGROUND CHECK.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.250
ON WHO?

21:58.250 --> 22:00.208
TAMMY OKAMA.

22:00.208 --> 22:03.625
YOU SLEPT WITH HER,
DIDN'T YOU?

22:03.625 --> 22:07.291
VINCE MASUKA
DOES NOT KISS AND TELL.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.625
OKAY, FINE,
I BANGED HER.

22:08.625 --> 22:09.667
[laughter]

22:09.667 --> 22:11.291
AND?

22:11.291 --> 22:13.583
AND...WOW.

22:13.583 --> 22:16.834
WE JUST STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT JUST--

22:16.834 --> 22:18.458
JUST TALKING.

22:20.583 --> 22:21.709
SO YOU LIKE HER?

22:21.709 --> 22:23.000
[sighs]

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
THE PROBLEM IS
SHE LIKES ME.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.333
I MEAN, THERE'S GOTTA BE
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER, RIGHT?

22:28.333 --> 22:31.291
WELL, I'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN THE SERVER'S UP.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.458
(Dexter)
IF HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS,

22:45.458 --> 22:48.208
WHERE DO YOU GO
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE A HEART?

22:48.208 --> 22:54.375
IN MIGUEL'S CASE,
A FIVE-STAR HOTEL.

22:54.375 --> 22:57.291
I USED TO KNOW MIGUEL'S SCHEDULE
INSIDE AND OUT.

22:57.291 --> 23:00.041
AFTER ALL,
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS.

23:00.041 --> 23:02.166
BUT THINGS CHANGE.

23:02.166 --> 23:04.041
NOW THAT SYL KICKED HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

23:04.041 --> 23:07.375
HE HAS A NEW ROUTINE
I NEED TO LEARN.

23:08.875 --> 23:10.542
[car door opens]

23:22.375 --> 23:23.667
CAN I GET MY KEYS?
I FORGOT SOMETHING.

23:23.667 --> 23:24.834
OH, YEAH, THERE YOU ARE,
MR. PRADO.

23:24.834 --> 23:26.000
THANK YOU.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.709
THANK YOU.

23:27.709 --> 23:31.542
[thinking]
OR I COULD WAIT FOR HIM
TO DO SOMETHING STUPID.

23:31.542 --> 23:32.917
LIKE DITCHING RAMON.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.208
YOU CLOSE
TO YOUR FATHER?

23:50.250 --> 23:51.875
NO.

23:51.875 --> 23:53.750
HE WAS, UH, DEADBEAT
TRAILER-TRASH.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.041
IT'S WHY I BECAME A COP.

23:55.041 --> 23:57.208
YOU GOT A RICH MOTHER
OR SOMETHING?

23:57.208 --> 23:58.667
SHE DIED WHEN I WAS FIVE.

23:58.667 --> 23:59.917
WHY?

23:59.917 --> 24:02.917
THE CAR, THE WATCH.

24:02.917 --> 24:04.917
JUST WONDERING
IF YOU HAD A TRUST FUND,

24:04.917 --> 24:06.417
OR YOU WERE DAY TRADING,
OR SOMETHING.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.166
NO.

24:08.166 --> 24:09.792
I GOT AN UNCLE IN BOSTON.

24:09.792 --> 24:11.750
HE DIED,
LEFT ME A BUILDING.

24:11.750 --> 24:12.875
TOTAL SURPRISE.

24:12.875 --> 24:14.667
HUH.

24:14.667 --> 24:17.083
FAMILY'S ARE FULL OF 'EM.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.208
JUST WAIT
TILL DEXTER'S WEDDING.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.417
BRINGS OUT THE BEST
AND THE WORST.

24:21.333 --> 24:23.750
WEDDINGS KINDA SUCK
WHEN YOU'RE SINGLE.

24:23.750 --> 24:25.458
SINGLE?

24:25.458 --> 24:27.542
I THOUGHT YOU
AND ANTON WERE--

24:27.542 --> 24:29.250
WE'RE NOT.
NOT ANYMORE.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.959
HMM.

24:30.959 --> 24:32.417
SO, UH...

24:32.417 --> 24:34.625
YOU WANNA, YOU KNOW,
CARPOOL?

24:36.875 --> 24:39.000
WHAT?

24:39.000 --> 24:40.291
HIGH GAS PRICES,

24:40.291 --> 24:42.083
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

24:42.083 --> 24:44.000
[cell phone rings]

24:44.000 --> 24:45.250

24:57.792 --> 24:59.333
IT'S BATISTA.

24:59.333 --> 25:00.959
PROBABLY WANTS
A STATUS UPDATE.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.458
WE SHOULD GIVE IT
TO HIM.

25:02.458 --> 25:03.500
HEY, YOU HAVE ANY CHANGE?

25:03.500 --> 25:05.041
I SAW A PAYPHONE
UP THE STREET.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.667
THINK SO.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.333
MOTHERFUCK!

25:13.333 --> 25:15.333
HOLY JESUS ON A STICK!

25:15.333 --> 25:17.208
WHAT?
NO CELL PHONE RECEPTION.

25:17.208 --> 25:19.375
THAT'S WHY GEORGE KING
TOOK ANTON'S CHANGE.

25:19.375 --> 25:21.125
TO USE THAT PAYPHONE.

25:21.125 --> 25:22.792
WE GOTTA DUMP
THE PHONE RECORDS.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.583
WHOA.

25:28.583 --> 25:30.417
OYE.

25:30.417 --> 25:32.667
SI?

25:32.667 --> 25:34.041
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED TODAY.

25:34.041 --> 25:36.834
I WAS SURPRISED,
BUT, UH, GLAD.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.125
THE LAST THING
I WANTED TO DO

25:42.125 --> 25:44.875
WAS PUT YOU
IN THE MIDDLE OF--

25:44.875 --> 25:47.041
MARIA, YOU GOTTA KNOW

25:47.041 --> 25:51.458
THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT US FOR A LONG TIME.

25:51.458 --> 25:55.583
WAY BEFORE ELLEN WOLF,
REST IN PEACE.

25:58.542 --> 26:00.750
'CAUSE, HEY,
WHAT WE HAD--

26:00.750 --> 26:02.917
WE WERE DIFFERENT BACK THEN.

26:02.917 --> 26:04.542
REALLY DIFFERENT.

26:04.542 --> 26:07.667
SO WHY IS IT EVERY TIME
I LOOK AT YOU

26:07.667 --> 26:10.959
I STILL FEEL THE SAME WAY I FELT
WHEN WE FIRST MET?

26:10.959 --> 26:12.583
HMM?

26:14.792 --> 26:15.709
WATER'S BOILING.

26:15.709 --> 26:18.208
BOILING, YES, OOH.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.583
IT'S MI SOPA.

26:22.458 --> 26:24.000
AND I GOT YOU
SOME RED STRIPE.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.583
OH, WOW, GREAT.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.333
SOMEWHERE.
SHIT, I LEFT IT IN THE CAR.

26:27.333 --> 26:28.333
OH, I'LL GO GET IT.

26:28.333 --> 26:29.583
NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:29.583 --> 26:32.875
YOU STAY AND MAKE SURE
IT DOESN'T BOIL OVER.

26:32.875 --> 26:34.458
[chuckling]
OKAY.

27:04.458 --> 27:08.542
[thinking]
MIGUEL PROBABLY THINKS
HE'S GETTING LUCKY.

27:08.542 --> 27:10.625
LOOKS LIKE
HE'S GETTING SCREWED.

27:45.458 --> 27:46.959
THEY MAKE A CUTE COUPLE.

27:46.959 --> 27:48.917

28:25.750 --> 28:27.625
DON'T GO THERE, MIGUEL.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.583
YOU START THINKING LAGUERTA'S
ON TO YOU,

28:29.583 --> 28:31.041
YOU'LL DECIDE
TO DO VERY BAD THINGS

28:31.041 --> 28:33.542
TO ANOTHER INNOCENT PERSON.

28:33.542 --> 28:35.500
AND I CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN.

28:47.375 --> 28:49.875
THINGS TO DO TODAY:

28:49.875 --> 28:52.500
FIND A NON-BLOWBACK WAY

28:52.500 --> 28:53.917
TO DISPOSE MIGUEL'S BODY.

29:00.625 --> 29:03.583
I NEED YOU TO RUN HAIR
AND FIBER FOR ME

29:03.583 --> 29:05.375
AGAINST ALL VICTIMS
FOR THE LAST TEN DAYS.

29:05.375 --> 29:08.625
BUT I'M THE BLOOD GUY.

29:08.625 --> 29:10.542
WHO ALSO DOES FORENSICS.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.458
WHO I TRUST
TO KEEP A CONFIDENCE

29:12.458 --> 29:13.959
AND THE LAB RESULTS
OFF THE RECORD.

29:13.959 --> 29:16.750
WELL, KEEPING SECRETS
IS ONE OF MY STRONG SUITS,

29:16.750 --> 29:18.583
BUT I KINDA GOT MY HEAD
HANDED TO ME

29:18.583 --> 29:20.917
THE LAST TIME I DID SOME
OFF-THE-GRID TESTING, BY YOU.

29:20.917 --> 29:22.625
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

29:22.625 --> 29:24.166
THAT WAS
BUREAUCRATIC BULLSHIT.

29:24.166 --> 29:26.834
AND THIS IS,
"DO AS I SAY, NOT AS I DO"?

29:26.834 --> 29:31.667
YOU EVER GET A VOICE
INSIDE NAGGING AT YOU?

29:31.667 --> 29:33.959
I'M AWARE
OF THE PHENOMENON.

29:33.959 --> 29:36.792
WELL, I'M HOPING
I'M WRONG ABOUT THIS.

29:36.792 --> 29:39.709
BUT IF I AM
AND ANYONE FINDS OUT,

29:39.709 --> 29:41.750
IT'LL BRING A SHIT HURRICANE
DOWN ON THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT.

29:41.750 --> 29:43.417
AND IF YOU'RE RIGHT?

29:43.417 --> 29:46.166
SAME HURRICANE,
DIFFERENT LANDFALL.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.750
GOT IT.

29:47.750 --> 29:49.750
EITHER WAY,
I NEED A RAINCOAT.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.417
NO, I DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
INTO ANY TROUBLE OVER THIS.

29:51.417 --> 29:53.000
USE MY AUTHORIZATION CODE
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.917

30:00.291 --> 30:02.166
ABSOLUTELY.

30:02.166 --> 30:04.417
IF YOU NEED SOMETHING
UNDER THE TABLE, I'M YOUR GUY.

30:06.625 --> 30:08.792
THAT DIDN'T COME OUT RIGHT.

30:08.792 --> 30:12.250
HOW SOON BEFORE YOU CAN GET
BACK TO ME WITH THIS?

[computer alert beeps]

31:31.792 --> 31:33.000
(Debra)
MUDS AND LUDS
FROM THAT PAYPHONE.

31:33.000 --> 31:36.208
GEORGE KING WAS USING IT
LIKE AN OFFICE LINE.

31:36.208 --> 31:37.875
HE CALLED CLIENTS,
HE CALLED WORKERS,

31:37.875 --> 31:39.542
HE ORDERED NICARAGUAN
TAKE-OUT.

31:39.542 --> 31:40.875
THAT DOESN'T HELP US.

31:40.875 --> 31:42.208
WELL, MAYBE IT DOES.

31:42.208 --> 31:43.750
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHO
WITH SOME LADY

31:43.750 --> 31:45.333
THAT HE CALLED
UP IN NEW JERSEY.

31:45.333 --> 31:47.250
SHE WINTERS DOWN HERE
AT COCONUT GROVE.

31:47.250 --> 31:49.792
SHE JUST RE-HIRED GEORGE KING
TO RE-LANDSCAPE THEIR LAWN.

31:49.792 --> 31:51.625
SO...

31:51.625 --> 31:52.792
SO HE KNOWS
THE PLACE IS EMPTY.

31:52.792 --> 31:55.458
YOU THINK HE'D BE USING IT
TO LAY LOW?

31:55.458 --> 31:57.166
WE GOT FUCK-ALL ELSE.

31:59.208 --> 32:00.875
VINCE.

32:00.875 --> 32:04.417
THE SERVER'S BACK UP,
SO I RAN YOUR GIRL.

32:04.417 --> 32:06.458
BAD NEWS.

32:06.458 --> 32:07.917
SHE'S GOT A RAP SHEET.

32:10.250 --> 32:13.166
SHE RAMMED HER CAR INTO SOMEONE
ELSE OVER A PARKING SPACE.

32:13.166 --> 32:15.333
YEAH.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.208
BIG FINE,
ANGER MANAGEMENT.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.041
THAT MEANS
SHE'S GOT ISSUES.

32:20.750 --> 32:22.125
SO SHE'S NOT
OUTTA MY LEAGUE.

32:25.500 --> 32:27.125
HAPPY TO HELP.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.125

BOTH CAUCASOID.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.875

PIGMENT GRANULES.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.125
SAME DYE JOB.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.291
IN OTHER WORDS,
BOTH ELLEN WOLF.

32:40.291 --> 32:41.875
NO NEWS THERE.

32:41.875 --> 32:45.792
DO I LET LAGUERTA
IN ON THIS?

32:45.792 --> 32:49.417
BUT WHY STIR UP
THE HORNET'S NEST?

32:49.417 --> 32:50.583
MIGUEL'S GOING TO GET
THE JUSTICE

32:50.583 --> 32:52.750
HE DESERVES SOON ENOUGH.

32:52.750 --> 32:53.750
HEY, DEX.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.875
HEY.

32:55.875 --> 32:57.667
TOO LATE TO BRING A DATE
TO THE WEDDING?

32:57.667 --> 32:59.834
NO, RITA'S
STILL COLLECTING RSVPs.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.125
I WAS CURIOUS.

33:08.125 --> 33:10.417
OH, DUDE,
I'VE TOTALLY DONE THAT.

33:10.417 --> 33:12.417
YOU'RE BALD.

33:15.375 --> 33:17.333
OH.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.875
MAYBE WE SHOULD CALL
FOR BACKUP?

33:46.875 --> 33:48.625
LET'S SEE
WHAT WE GOT FIRST.

WHAT'S THIS?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.750
DEXTER, I NEED TO SEE YOU
FOR A MINUTE.

35:08.667 --> 35:10.458
YOU FOUND
THE HAIR ANALYSIS RESULTS?

35:10.458 --> 35:12.291
SORRY, IT--

35:12.291 --> 35:15.500
YOU WERE OUT, AND THEY WERE
JUST SITTING THERE,

35:15.500 --> 35:19.208
AND I REALLY NEEDED TO KNOW
WHAT CAME BACK.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.041
SO.

35:23.041 --> 35:24.625
NOW YOU KNOW.

35:24.625 --> 35:25.875
QUESTION IS,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

35:28.917 --> 35:31.000
IT'S COMPLICATED.

35:31.000 --> 35:33.667
I UNDERSTAND COMPLICATED.

35:33.667 --> 35:34.917
MAYBE I CAN HELP.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.542
OKAY.

35:41.542 --> 35:44.417
YOU'RE CLOSE WITH MIGUEL PRADO,
AND SO AM I,

35:44.417 --> 35:47.083
WHICH IS WHAT MAKES
THIS VERY DIFFICULT.

35:47.083 --> 35:49.625
WHAT'S THIS GOTTA DO
WITH MIGUEL?

35:49.625 --> 35:54.000
ELLEN WOLF WAS THREATENING
TO WRECK HIS CAREER.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.959
WELL, HE HAS A BLACK SUV

35:55.959 --> 35:58.417
AND NO ALIBI
FOR THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

36:01.041 --> 36:03.041
YOU THINK MIGUEL HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH HER MURDER?

36:03.041 --> 36:07.250
I FOUND THIS SAMPLE
IN THE BACK OF HIS CAR.

36:11.500 --> 36:14.709
I TOLD YOU
THIS WAS COMPLICATED.

36:14.709 --> 36:17.083

36:17.083 --> 36:20.166
I NEED YOUR WORD
THIS STAYS BETWEEN US.

36:20.166 --> 36:22.125
YEAH, YOU HAVE IT.

36:25.041 --> 36:26.834
NO WONDER ALL THE SECRECY.

36:29.375 --> 36:31.125
I'M ASSUMING THERE'S
NO CHAIN OF CUSTODY ON THIS?

36:31.125 --> 36:32.333
I'LL GO TO A JUDGE
FOR A WARRANT.

36:32.333 --> 36:34.166
GET EVIDENCE
THROUGH PROPER CHANNELS.

36:34.166 --> 36:38.291
[thinking]
WHICH WILL TIP OFF MIGUEL AND
PUT LAGUERTA IN HIS CROSSHAIRS.

36:38.291 --> 36:40.333
YOU REALLY THINK A JUDGE
IS GONNA ISSUE A WARRANT

36:40.333 --> 36:42.375
AGAINST A WELL-RESPECTED
OFFICER OF THE COURT

36:42.375 --> 36:43.667
WITHOUT PROBABLE CAUSE?

36:43.667 --> 36:46.417
I DON'T KNOW, DEXTER.

36:46.417 --> 36:48.750
AND I CAN'T DO NOTHING.

36:48.750 --> 36:50.583
NOT AFTER THESE RESULTS.

36:50.583 --> 36:54.125
MAYBE YOU COULD SIT ON IT.

36:54.125 --> 36:56.959
FOR A WHILE.

36:56.959 --> 36:59.542
LET MIGUEL THINK
HE GOT AWAY WITH MURDER.

37:03.000 --> 37:05.417
IT'D GIVE YOU TIME
TO BUILD A SOLID CASE.

37:09.917 --> 37:12.875
I'VE GOT SOME SERIOUS
SOUL SEARCHING TO DO.

37:12.875 --> 37:15.834
[thinking]
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED.

37:15.834 --> 37:17.500
THANKS FOR YOUR HELP,
DEXTER.

37:17.500 --> 37:19.250
YEAH.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.542
[thinking]
WHILE LAGUERTA'S DECIDING,

37:24.542 --> 37:26.208
I'LL BE ELIMINATING
HER PROBLEM.

37:26.208 --> 37:28.458
AND GEORGE KING'S
GOING TO HELP ME.

37:28.458 --> 37:30.291
I'LL COPY HIS M.O.

37:30.291 --> 37:32.125
THEY WON'T EVEN LOOK
FOR ANOTHER SUSPECT.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.875
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:33.875 --> 37:34.917
(Quinn)
KING.

37:34.917 --> 37:36.583
I TOLD HIM TO GO HOME,

37:36.583 --> 37:39.583
BUT HE'S HELL-BENT ON PROVING
HE HAS CAJONES  OF STEEL.

37:39.583 --> 37:41.291
YOU GOOD?

37:41.291 --> 37:43.250
SUPERFICIAL CUT.
LET'S KEEP MOVING.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.959
ALL RIGHT, GET ME YOUR REPORT
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

37:46.917 --> 37:49.250
THE BRASS
IS GONNA BE ASKING QUESTIONS.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.125
WE HAD AERIAL SURVEILLANCE,
A SECURITY PERIMETER,

37:51.125 --> 37:53.166
AT LEAST 50 OFFICERS.

37:53.166 --> 37:55.417
IT'S LIKE GEORGE KING
IS A GHOST.

37:55.417 --> 37:57.959
SORRY, SARGE.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.083
[thinking]
I'M NOT.

37:59.083 --> 38:00.417
I NEED KING OUT THERE
LONG ENOUGH

38:00.417 --> 38:02.208
TO PEG MIGUEL'S MURDER
ON HIM.

38:02.208 --> 38:04.583
HOW LONG HAVE
YOU KNOWN?

38:04.583 --> 38:05.917
HUH?

38:05.917 --> 38:07.542
ABOUT DAD AND HIS C.I.

38:11.375 --> 38:14.750
UH, COUPLE OF WEEKS.

38:16.625 --> 38:18.875

RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED.

38:18.875 --> 38:20.750
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I SHOULD--

38:20.750 --> 38:22.250
TELL ME?

38:22.250 --> 38:23.959
YES, WHENEVER YOU HAVE
AN EARTH-SHATTERING,

38:23.959 --> 38:26.125
BALL-CRUSHING,
MIND-FUCK OF A SECRET,

38:26.125 --> 38:27.500
YOU SHOULD TELL
YOUR FUCKING SISTER.

38:29.625 --> 38:31.333
SORRY.

38:31.333 --> 38:34.709
[cell phone vibrates]

38:34.709 --> 38:36.166
YOU CAN GET THAT NOW.

38:39.625 --> 38:45.500
RITA WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU'RE
BRINGING ANTON TO THE WEDDING.

38:45.500 --> 38:46.750
BAD TIMING.

38:49.166 --> 38:51.500
NO,
I'M NOT BRINGING HIM.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.667
QUINN SORT OF ASKED
IF I WOULD GO AS HIS DATE.

38:56.667 --> 38:59.583
BUT AS MUCH AS I'LL HATE
GOING STAG

38:59.583 --> 39:03.500
TO MY OWN BROTHER'S WEDDING,
BEING QUINN'S DATE

39:03.500 --> 39:05.375
DEPRESSES ME EVEN MORE.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.709
HE SEEMS OKAY.

39:07.709 --> 39:11.000
YEAH, HE'S FINE.

39:11.000 --> 39:13.208
ON PAPER HE'S A COP.

39:13.208 --> 39:15.291
GOOD CAREER.

39:15.291 --> 39:17.834
LIKE DAD.

39:17.834 --> 39:19.250
YEAH.

39:19.250 --> 39:22.333
WELL, IT SEEMS
I DON'T KNOW DAD

39:22.333 --> 39:24.542
AS WELL
AS I THOUGHT I DID.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.458
TURNS OUT I'M JUST AS BIG
A FUCK-UP AS HE WAS.

39:26.458 --> 39:28.500
YOU'RE NOT A FUCK-UP.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.000
YOU'RE THE HARDEST WORKING
PERSON I KNOW.

39:30.000 --> 39:32.583
YOU'RE LOYAL TO A FAULT.

39:32.583 --> 39:35.000
IN ALL THE YEARS I'VE KNOWN YOU,
YOU'VE NEVER LET ME DOWN.

39:40.417 --> 39:42.834
YOU SHOULD BE MY BEST MAN.

39:42.834 --> 39:45.583
WHAT?

39:47.625 --> 39:49.125
MIGUEL IS YOUR BEST MAN.

39:49.125 --> 39:50.542
HE'S NOT EVEN A GOOD MAN.

39:50.542 --> 39:52.875
I SHOULDA ASKED YOU
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

39:52.875 --> 39:54.709
SO WHY DIDN'T YOU?

39:54.709 --> 39:56.083
I DON'T KNOW.

39:56.083 --> 39:58.709
I THOUGHT THE BEST MAN
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN.

39:58.709 --> 40:02.709
BUT I TRUST YOU...

40:02.709 --> 40:04.500
MORE THAN ANYONE.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.208
THAT'S WAY MORE IMPORTANT.

40:08.208 --> 40:12.375
YOU BETTER NOT BE DOING THIS
BECAUSE YOU FEEL GUILTY.

40:12.375 --> 40:15.750
WOULD YOU JUST...
STAND UP FOR ME?

40:19.709 --> 40:21.875
ABSO-FUCKING-LUTELY.

40:26.959 --> 40:28.125
HEY!

40:28.125 --> 40:30.333
LONG TIME.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.458
TOO BUSY
WITH THAT NEW BOYFRIEND OF YOURS

40:32.458 --> 40:34.041
TO COME DOWN
AND TALK SHIT WITH ME?

40:34.041 --> 40:35.375
WHAT?
WORD TRAVELS.

40:35.375 --> 40:37.875
WELL, NOT FAST ENOUGH.
WE BROKE UP.

40:37.875 --> 40:40.000
HEY, FUCK HIM.
HIS LOSS.

40:40.000 --> 40:43.041
YEAH, WELL...

40:43.041 --> 40:44.583
I KINDA NEED A FAVOR.

40:44.583 --> 40:46.500
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
WHAT YOU NEED?

40:46.500 --> 40:49.792
ALL THE RECORDS YOU HAVE ON MY
DAD'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS.

40:49.792 --> 40:50.959
YOUR DAD?

40:50.959 --> 40:52.208
I KNOW IT'S A BIG DIG,

40:52.208 --> 40:53.917
BUT I JUST NEED
THE FEMALE C.I.'S.

40:53.917 --> 40:57.417
AND PROBABLY JUST
THE ATTRACTIVE ONES.

40:57.417 --> 41:00.417
SOMEONE SAID
SOMETHING TO YOU...

41:00.417 --> 41:03.083
ABOUT HARRY
AND ONE OF HIS C.I.'S?

41:03.083 --> 41:05.458
HIS ATTRACTIVE
FEMALE C.I.'S?

41:05.458 --> 41:07.792
WHY,
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?

41:07.792 --> 41:09.166
WHAT I KNOW IS,
YOUR DAD WOULDN'T BE

41:09.166 --> 41:10.625
THE FIRST COP TO FUCK AROUND
ON HIS WIFE.

41:10.625 --> 41:14.125
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A LOT OF REQUESTS, BUT--

41:14.125 --> 41:15.417
BUT NOTHING.

41:15.417 --> 41:18.083
MY DAD STEPPED OUT
ON MY MOM.

41:18.083 --> 41:19.667
WOULDA CUT OFF HIS DICK
IF I COULDA.

41:21.458 --> 41:22.542
I'LL PUT A RUSH ON IT.

41:22.542 --> 41:24.458
THANK YOU.

MIGUEL'S A NIGHT OWL
AND A NEWLY MINTED BACHELOR.

41:37.208 --> 41:38.834
NO WAY HE'S
IN BED THIS EARLY.

41:41.417 --> 41:42.834
(Miguel)
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

41:42.834 --> 41:44.000
I'M NOT GOING TO SLEEP.

ARE KNOCKING THEM BACK,

41:50.333 --> 41:51.583

HE'S PLANNING
TO KILL AGAIN.

43:27.417 --> 43:30.458

OKAY, OKAY, I--

46:10.083 --> 46:12.250
I KNOW I--

46:12.250 --> 46:13.750
I CROSSED
THE LINE HERE.

46:13.750 --> 46:15.750
I KNOW THAT NOW.

46:15.750 --> 46:18.917
IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO COME TO THIS.

46:18.917 --> 46:22.000
BUT IT ALWAYS DOES.

46:22.000 --> 46:24.333
I HAD HIGHER HOPES
FOR YOU.

46:24.333 --> 46:28.250
FOR US.

46:28.250 --> 46:30.583
BUT I FINALLY JUST HAVE
TO ACCEPT IT.

46:30.583 --> 46:32.125
I'LL ALWAYS BE ALONE.

46:32.125 --> 46:33.667
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

46:33.667 --> 46:35.458
YOU TALKING TRUTH?

46:35.458 --> 46:37.000
THAT'S GOOD.

46:38.542 --> 46:40.333
YOU ACTUALLY HAD ME
BELIEVING

46:40.333 --> 46:42.750
I COULD HAVE A FRIEND,

46:42.750 --> 46:45.667
'CAUSE I SWALLOWED
YOUR BULLSHIT.

46:45.667 --> 46:47.166
IT WASN'T BULLSHIT!

46:47.166 --> 46:48.625
[gags]
SHH.

46:52.291 --> 46:54.333
I TRIED.

46:54.333 --> 46:56.750
I TRIED...

46:56.750 --> 46:58.792
TO CRACK
THAT DAMN ARMOR OF YOURS.

47:00.667 --> 47:03.291
BECAUSE I SAW
THE POSSIBILITY.

47:03.291 --> 47:05.417
I STILL SEE
THE POSSIBILITIES.

47:05.417 --> 47:07.959
SO THIS IS MY FAULT
FOR BEING A SHUTDOWN?

47:07.959 --> 47:10.125
NO, I JUST WANT YOU
TO LET ME IN.

47:10.125 --> 47:14.291
WHY THE FUCK
WOULD I DO THAT NOW?

47:14.291 --> 47:17.917
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU.

47:17.917 --> 47:20.667
DEXTER, I KNOW YOU BETTER
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

47:20.667 --> 47:22.834
NO, THERE'VE BEEN
QUITE A FEW

47:22.834 --> 47:25.333
WHO'VE SEEN
THE REAL ME AS THEY...

47:25.333 --> 47:27.500
LAID ON THAT TABLE.

47:27.500 --> 47:31.959
YOU'RE ALL JUST UNCHECKED
VERSIONS OF MYSELF.

47:31.959 --> 47:35.917
WHAT I WOULD HAVE BECOME
WITHOUT MY FATHER'S CODE.

47:35.917 --> 47:37.959
THEY DESERVED IT!

47:37.959 --> 47:39.750
I'M NOT LIKE THEM!

47:39.750 --> 47:41.166
YOU ARE.

47:41.166 --> 47:42.500
ADMIT IT.

47:42.500 --> 47:44.625
I'M LIKE YOU.

47:44.625 --> 47:47.041
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

47:47.041 --> 47:49.542
I KNOW I'M A MONSTER.

47:49.542 --> 47:51.959
I ACCEPT YOU.

47:55.417 --> 47:58.917
I ACCEPT YOU, DEXTER,
LIKE A BROTHER.

47:58.917 --> 48:01.250
I KILLED MY BROTHER.

48:06.208 --> 48:09.542
I KILLED YOURS TOO.

48:13.458 --> 48:17.417
OSCAR?

48:17.417 --> 48:19.208
YOU?

48:19.208 --> 48:22.875
I DIDN'T PLAN TO,
BUT IT WAS KILL OR BE KILLED.

48:22.875 --> 48:26.291
YOU!

48:26.291 --> 48:28.500
YOU KILLED OSCAR!

48:28.500 --> 48:30.792
WHAT DID YOU SAY

48:30.792 --> 48:34.667
IN YOUR BACHELOR PARTY
SPEECH?

48:34.667 --> 48:39.333
"FRIENDS ARE ALWAYS HONEST."

48:39.333 --> 48:44.583
FRIENDS FORGIVE.

48:44.583 --> 48:48.250
FRIENDS FORGIVE.

48:48.250 --> 48:51.041
BUT I DON'T FORGIVE YOU.

48:58.834 --> 49:01.750
AND I DON'T GET TO HAVE
FRIENDS.

49:07.417 --> 49:08.750
YOU LITTLE FREAK!

49:08.750 --> 49:10.625
YOU THINK I'M DONE WITH YOU?

49:10.625 --> 49:12.375
YOU THINK THIS ENDS HERE?

49:12.375 --> 49:14.208
IT DOESN'T!

49:14.208 --> 49:15.750
IT DOES FOR YOU.
