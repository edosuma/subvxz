00:24.529 --> 00:26.167
Why didn't you invite him in?

00:26.609 --> 00:27.962
- Who?
- Your date.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.768
The guy you've been smooching
on the porch for the last ten minutes.

00:30.929 --> 00:31.918
Eavesdropping, were you?

00:32.089 --> 00:33.442
Well, I'm single again,

00:33.609 --> 00:36.248
so I have no choice but to live
vicariously through your love life.

00:36.409 --> 00:38.479
Wow, I'd pick a better love
life if I were you.

00:38.649 --> 00:40.765
Lately, mine's been rated PG
for "pretty grim."

00:40.929 --> 00:43.489
That's because no one ever makes
it past the threshold, Prue.

00:43.769 --> 00:46.647
I mean don't get me wrong.
I'm glad that you're out there looking,

00:46.809 --> 00:48.765
but you can't keep saving
yourself for Mr. Right.

00:48.929 --> 00:50.647
I need more vicarious thrills
than that.

00:50.809 --> 00:53.118
I am not saving myself for Mr. Right.

00:53.609 --> 00:56.442
I mean Mr. Interesting would do,
or Mr. Personality,

00:56.609 --> 00:59.442
or even Mr. Take-My-Breath-Away.
I don't care.

00:59.609 --> 01:01.679
Be careful with the last one.

01:01.889 --> 01:05.438
They tend to surprise you
in all the wrong ways.

01:08.849 --> 01:10.760
"Cole likes...

01:11.689 --> 01:14.408
...walks in the park,
jazz and fine wine."

01:14.569 --> 01:17.367
- Phoebe, what are you doing?
- Well, Cole's a demon.

01:17.529 --> 01:20.248
We write about demons in
the Book of Shadows, don't we?

01:20.969 --> 01:23.403
Right, but this kind of stuff?

01:23.569 --> 01:25.207
Do you really think that's necessary?

01:25.409 --> 01:29.687
Yeah, if it prepares future witches
in case he attacks, absolutely.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.641
The more that they know about Cole,

01:31.809 --> 01:34.528
the better chance they have
of hurting him before he hurts them.

01:35.649 --> 01:36.843
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:37.169 --> 01:39.239
No, there's nothing to talk about.

01:39.409 --> 01:42.401
I loved, I lost,
and now I'm moving on.

01:45.489 --> 01:47.286
- What was that?
- Piper.

01:48.449 --> 01:49.643
All right, where is she?

01:49.889 --> 01:51.800
In the bunker formerly known
as the basement.

01:51.969 --> 01:54.437
I thought she was getting a handle
on her new powers.

01:54.609 --> 01:57.601
Yeah, that was before her new powers
got a handle on her. Piper!

01:57.769 --> 02:00.237
- What?
- Are you okay?

02:00.409 --> 02:01.558
I'm fine.

02:04.329 --> 02:06.638
The Christmas decorations are not.

02:06.809 --> 02:07.844
Can we come down?

02:08.049 --> 02:11.007
No. Stay away from the door.
It's not safe.

02:11.169 --> 02:13.683
Piper, that's ridiculous.
We're your sisters.

02:14.089 --> 02:16.523
Maybe we should back up
just a little bit.

02:18.529 --> 02:20.167
Jeez, who let the dogs out?

02:20.329 --> 02:22.684
- You can't stay down there forever.
- Yes, I can.

02:22.929 --> 02:25.124
No, you can't.
You have a club to run and a husband

02:25.289 --> 02:26.722
who can't stand to live without you.

02:26.889 --> 02:29.403
That's right.
And two sisters who need you

02:29.569 --> 02:31.560
to cook for them
and fight evil with them.

02:31.929 --> 02:35.399
Okay, do you want her to come up,
or do you want her to stay down there?

02:36.209 --> 02:38.359
What is going on?

02:44.569 --> 02:45.968
What was that? What happened?

02:46.209 --> 02:48.848
Nothing. Just relax.

02:49.209 --> 02:51.006
It was only Kit.
Don't blow anything up.

02:51.329 --> 02:53.479
All right, what the hell
is going on out there?

03:03.969 --> 03:05.766
Oh, Cathryn.

03:07.369 --> 03:09.644
Oh, Cathryn, my darling.

03:17.969 --> 03:19.766
Misty, stop it.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.480
- Morning.
- Morning.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.684
You're not still writing in there
about Cole, are you?

05:25.849 --> 05:27.680
- Nope.
- Good.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.443
I'm actually writing about
his demonic half now.

05:31.689 --> 05:34.283
Phoebe, I'm starting to get
a little worried about you.

05:34.449 --> 05:37.043
Oh, don't worry about me,
worry about Piper.

05:37.409 --> 05:39.798
Why? Is she still locked
in the basement?

05:40.089 --> 05:42.080
No, she's locked herself
in her bedroom now.

05:42.369 --> 05:44.678
Well, at least somebody's improving.

05:48.529 --> 05:51.726
Looks like we weren't the only ones
annoyed by the dogs barking last night.

05:52.049 --> 05:54.927
It says that there was a record number
of noise complaints.

05:56.209 --> 05:58.882
It says here that
at the exact same time,

05:59.049 --> 06:01.279
there was a man murdered
in our neighbourhood.

06:01.689 --> 06:03.008
Do you mind?

06:03.689 --> 06:09.207
No motive, nothing stolen,
nothing to suggest how he was killed,

06:09.449 --> 06:11.280
lots of shattered glass everywhere.

06:11.489 --> 06:14.606
You know this isn't gonna work,
you trying to distract me...

06:19.809 --> 06:23.006
- What?
- I saw a little girl.

06:23.329 --> 06:24.967
She couldn't have been any older...

06:25.369 --> 06:28.327
...than 14 or 15. Did you mention
something about shattered glass?

06:28.529 --> 06:29.723
Yeah.

06:30.809 --> 06:34.324
I think you're right. I think a demon
was responsible for that man's death.

06:34.609 --> 06:36.201
And I think I know which one.

06:43.649 --> 06:45.082
Pheebs, what are you doing?

06:48.209 --> 06:50.643
If we use the magic-to-magic spell
to summon Cole,

06:50.969 --> 06:52.561
and then we vanquish him...

06:53.889 --> 06:57.006
Wait. What makes you think
that Cole is responsible?

06:57.409 --> 07:00.685
I was holding the Belthazor page
when I got the premonition.

07:00.849 --> 07:05.240
But shattered glass, an old man,
a teenager, that's not exactly his m.o.

07:05.409 --> 07:07.127
Then why else would I get
the premonition?

07:07.329 --> 07:10.958
I don't know, Phoebe, but I think
you're barking up the wrong demon.

07:11.569 --> 07:15.482
Look, I know that he hurt you. But that
doesn't necessarily mean that he's...

07:15.649 --> 07:18.959
Prue, I can do this with you
or without you.

07:20.449 --> 07:22.917
Just, please,
get the vanquishing potion.

07:23.089 --> 07:26.001
- And what if the potion doesn't work?
- It'll work.

07:26.329 --> 07:27.728
It has to.

07:44.449 --> 07:47.759
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

07:47.969 --> 07:52.087
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

07:53.769 --> 07:55.202
No!

07:55.409 --> 07:58.560
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

07:58.849 --> 08:02.478
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

08:10.409 --> 08:12.206
Here he comes.

08:26.569 --> 08:27.922
Wait a minute.

08:28.329 --> 08:30.718
- What happened? Why didn't it work?
- I don't know.

08:33.129 --> 08:34.278
Damn it.

08:34.448 --> 08:37.759
All right, we're just gonna have to find
the girl another way.

08:37.929 --> 08:40.318
Was there anything
in your premonition that might help?

08:40.529 --> 08:44.078
Dark alley, late at night, phone booth.
I mean, there's not much to go on.

08:44.249 --> 08:48.003
So we'll have to go to the first victim's
apartment and see if anything's there.

08:48.249 --> 08:50.080
- Should we get Piper?
- No. Let's not put her

08:50.249 --> 08:52.205
any more on edge
than she already is. Come on.

08:52.409 --> 08:54.718
Soft inhalation.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.398
Slow, deep exhalation.

09:00.929 --> 09:03.966
Be at peace in this moment

09:04.129 --> 09:07.087
as you allow your mind to drift...

09:08.889 --> 09:11.198
...slow. Breathe as...

09:12.689 --> 09:15.806
Leo! You're supposed
to knock, not orb!

09:15.969 --> 09:17.402
But I live here.

09:19.449 --> 09:21.599
Okay, okay. Just relax.

09:21.769 --> 09:23.760
That's what I was trying to do,

09:23.929 --> 09:26.284
and then somebody
made me blow up my guru.

09:27.449 --> 09:31.203
No, no, no!
Stay away. I am not safe.

09:31.769 --> 09:33.327
- Piper, come on.
- No, I mean it.

09:33.529 --> 09:36.726
My hands are lethal weapons,
and I don't know how to control it.

09:36.889 --> 09:38.402
And it gets worse every day.

09:38.649 --> 09:40.401
Well, that's normal.
It took you a while

09:40.569 --> 09:43.322
to learn how to control
your freezing power, remember?

09:43.489 --> 09:44.558
Freezing is one thing.

09:44.729 --> 09:47.368
Blowing up stuff
is another thing altogether.

09:47.569 --> 09:50.879
Well, except this time
you're not alone. I'm here.

09:51.409 --> 09:54.401
Yeah, but you shouldn't be here.
You shouldn't be anywhere near me.

09:54.569 --> 09:55.638
It's too dangerous.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.521
Then how are we gonna go
on our honeymoon?

09:57.889 --> 10:00.642
We're not gonna go on our
honeymoon, we're gonna cancel it.

10:00.809 --> 10:02.640
We are not
cancelling our honeymoon.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.004
Well, then tell the Elders to take
this power back.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.648
I don't want it.
I'm not ready for it.

10:06.849 --> 10:09.568
They wouldn't have given it to you
if you weren't ready. I know that,

10:09.729 --> 10:11.606
both as your whitelighter
and as your husband.

10:11.809 --> 10:14.004
What if you're wrong?
What if I hurt someone?

10:14.209 --> 10:17.121
I just... I feel so helpless.

10:17.769 --> 10:19.839
One thing you're not is helpless.

10:20.289 --> 10:24.885
You are one of the strongest, most
capable people I have ever known.

10:25.609 --> 10:28.407
And don't forget,
I've been around for a while.

10:29.329 --> 10:30.364
Really?

10:30.529 --> 10:32.247
You can handle this, honey.

10:33.009 --> 10:35.000
We can handle it together.

10:45.169 --> 10:47.399
So, what kind of specialists
are you anyway?

10:47.729 --> 10:49.560
Inspector Morris didn't tell you?

10:50.169 --> 10:51.602
No, he didn't.

10:52.009 --> 10:52.998
Can I pick this up?

10:53.169 --> 10:55.239
Sure. Forensics is done here.

10:56.449 --> 10:59.600
Are you those psychics we keep
hearing about he was working with?

11:01.409 --> 11:03.718
Psychics. Right, that's a good one.

11:04.249 --> 11:05.648
Is this the victim's wife?

11:06.129 --> 11:07.608
Yeah, she died a couple
of months ago.

11:07.929 --> 11:09.681
Neighbours say the poor guy
never got over it.

11:10.209 --> 11:12.165
- Any suspects?
- All we know

11:12.369 --> 11:16.806
is whoever did it, busted through
that window, although three stories up.

11:17.369 --> 11:19.644
- Nobody can figure out how.
- Do you see any scorch marks

11:19.809 --> 11:21.162
by where the body was?

11:21.329 --> 11:23.763
I don't think that there would
have been a body...

11:25.089 --> 11:27.000
...if that particular weapon
had been used.

11:27.169 --> 11:29.364
- Are you from arson?
- No, she was just

11:29.769 --> 11:31.043
curious of how he died.

11:31.209 --> 11:33.484
He drowned in his own blood,
according to the ME.

11:33.689 --> 11:36.487
All his blood vessels just burst
for no reason.

11:37.409 --> 11:38.558
Are you feds?

11:39.569 --> 11:41.878
Actually, inspector,

11:42.249 --> 11:44.126
we're witches. Okay?

11:44.289 --> 11:46.484
We actually think a demon
might have done this,

11:46.689 --> 11:48.645
probably my ex-boyfriend.
And if he did do this,

11:48.809 --> 11:50.527
then we have to find him
and vanquish him.

11:50.889 --> 11:52.288
Satisfied?

11:53.169 --> 11:54.727
That's very funny.

12:01.929 --> 12:05.365
- Okay, are you out of your mind?
- Well, it got rid of him, didn't it?

12:06.609 --> 12:09.328
- So, what do you think?
- Definitely supernatural,

12:09.489 --> 12:11.047
but was it Belthazor?

12:13.249 --> 12:15.285
Well, they must have some
of the vanquishing potion,

12:15.449 --> 12:16.928
otherwise, why try to summon me?

12:17.609 --> 12:21.727
Perhaps the witch
who loved you wants you back.

12:22.369 --> 12:24.360
Humans can be very forgiving.

12:25.569 --> 12:27.480
Not this human, not after what I did.

12:27.689 --> 12:30.078
If I know her,
she wants to crucify me.

12:30.969 --> 12:33.164
And knowing her
is exactly what I wanted you

12:33.329 --> 12:36.480
to help me stop doing, Alchemist.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.847
If I'm to fully revert
to my demonic self,

12:40.009 --> 12:41.761
I need to break all ties,
remove all doubt.

12:42.169 --> 12:44.763
Transmuting your blood
might make you immune

12:44.929 --> 12:47.682
to the witch's potion, Belthazor.

12:48.009 --> 12:51.922
But it won't necessarily make you
immune from her pull.

12:52.569 --> 12:54.241
That's all right.
If she summons me again...

12:54.449 --> 12:56.758
That's not the pull I'm talking about.

12:57.249 --> 12:59.888
Your human half
will always be vulnerable

13:00.089 --> 13:03.206
to that which makes
all humans vulnerable.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.961
No sorcery can change that.

13:11.609 --> 13:13.565
Then do what you can.

13:31.969 --> 13:33.482
I'm telling you, it's gotta be Cole.

13:33.969 --> 13:37.200
Phoebe, just because you want it to be
him, doesn't necessarily make it him.

13:37.449 --> 13:38.802
This isn't about me and Cole.

13:38.969 --> 13:40.118
This is about what I saw.

13:40.289 --> 13:42.359
My premonitions are always
directly connected

13:42.529 --> 13:44.645
to what I'm touching at the time.

13:45.249 --> 13:46.762
Okay, well, wait a minute.

13:46.929 --> 13:50.968
What if the back of your hand
was touching this page?

13:52.489 --> 13:54.081
Right? A Banshee, whatever that is.

13:54.329 --> 13:56.524
It's a demon who feeds
on souls in great pain.

13:57.609 --> 14:00.077
Hey, stranger. Long time no see.

14:00.289 --> 14:02.359
Well, like you said,
I can't hide forever.

14:02.529 --> 14:04.679
Although you guys
should be wearing asbestos suits.

14:04.929 --> 14:06.885
Oh, I think we'll risk it.

14:07.249 --> 14:09.319
I just don't want anybody to get hurt.

14:09.729 --> 14:12.846
Well, since you can't freeze us,
you probably can't blow us up either.

14:14.049 --> 14:16.040
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.

14:16.329 --> 14:17.557
All right, so the Banshee.

14:17.729 --> 14:19.845
Well, they're pretty rare.
But what they do is hunt

14:20.009 --> 14:21.727
for their victims
with a high-pitched call,

14:21.889 --> 14:23.527
something beyond our range to hear.

14:23.889 --> 14:26.687
Okay, so then how do they find
their victims?

14:26.849 --> 14:28.999
By hearing the inner cry.

14:29.169 --> 14:32.559
By zeroing in on the waves of pain
that emanate from the stricken.

14:32.889 --> 14:34.686
Then their call turns
into a scream that kills.

14:34.849 --> 14:38.159
Well, that explains the broken
blood vessels and the shattered glass.

14:38.329 --> 14:41.127
Looks like it's not Cole after all.

14:41.929 --> 14:43.999
So, what do we do, wear earplugs?

14:44.609 --> 14:47.885
There is no spell to vanquish
the Banshee,

14:49.289 --> 14:51.439
but there is one
to track the Banshee.

14:52.369 --> 14:54.599
Okay, so all we need
is a designated tracker.

15:00.609 --> 15:01.928
You're sure about this?

15:02.089 --> 15:04.922
Well, with everything that you
and Piper are going through right now,

15:05.089 --> 15:07.319
I don't have much of a choice.
It's just a tracking spell.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.242
- What's the worst that can happen?
- With our history, don't go there.

15:10.489 --> 15:13.526
It's almost night, that's when the girl
in Phoebe's premonition was attacked.

15:13.689 --> 15:15.361
So let's just do it.

15:15.889 --> 15:20.246
"Let a piercing cry that feeds on pain
And leaves more sorrow than it gains

15:20.409 --> 15:24.197
Shall now be heard by one who seeks
To stop the havoc that it wreaks"

15:32.049 --> 15:33.323
Prue?

15:33.769 --> 15:35.521
Oh, my God.

15:35.809 --> 15:37.322
Prue?

15:50.049 --> 15:52.722
Come on, Prue.
Come on. Come on out.

15:53.729 --> 15:56.118
We're still your sisters, you know.
It's...

15:57.449 --> 16:00.680
Jeez, honey, don't sound so sad.
It's gonna be okay.

16:00.849 --> 16:03.079
How? How is this gonna be okay?

16:03.369 --> 16:05.644
Hands in your pockets.

16:07.449 --> 16:09.679
What did you find out?
Why did the spell backfire?

16:09.929 --> 16:12.284
- I don't think it did.
- What are you talking about, Leo?

16:12.489 --> 16:15.208
Prue is walking around
on all fours and barking.

16:15.369 --> 16:18.247
If that's not a backfire, then what is?

16:19.809 --> 16:21.208
You're scaring her.

16:21.489 --> 16:24.526
All right, all I'm saying is that
you guys cast a tracking spell.

16:24.889 --> 16:27.084
And since dogs can obviously
hear a Banshee's call,

16:27.249 --> 16:29.922
what happened makes sense.
Prue should be able to track it now.

16:30.169 --> 16:32.285
Yeah, if she ever comes out.

16:32.929 --> 16:34.123
Prue. Honey.

16:34.449 --> 16:37.566
Okay, you can't stay
under there all night.

16:39.649 --> 16:41.526
Okay, if you won't come out for you,

16:41.689 --> 16:43.964
will you at least come out
for an innocent?

16:44.129 --> 16:47.041
We can't save that teenage girl
without you.

16:54.529 --> 16:56.167
That's a good girl!

16:56.449 --> 16:57.962
That's a good girl!

16:58.129 --> 16:59.926
Who's a good girl?

17:00.209 --> 17:03.519
Well, at least we know
she understands what we're saying.

17:04.929 --> 17:08.887
- She's such a pretty dog.
- What else did you expect?

17:09.368 --> 17:10.961
A Doberman.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.848
Easy.

17:13.289 --> 17:15.244
Honey, watch your orbs.

17:15.529 --> 17:17.723
So, what do we have to do
to get our real sister back?

17:18.009 --> 17:21.797
Once the Banshee's vanquished,
the spell should reverse itself.

17:24.128 --> 17:27.201
Well, what if the Banshee
doesn't show up until, like, next year?

17:27.368 --> 17:29.087
Then... What do we do then?

17:29.409 --> 17:31.127
I don't think you'll have
to wait that long.

17:31.289 --> 17:33.678
Banshees have an insatiable appetite
for pain.

17:33.929 --> 17:35.647
- They feed every night.
- Okay,

17:35.809 --> 17:37.720
what do we do once
she finds the demon?

17:37.889 --> 17:42.280
I mean, there's no vanquishing potion,
there's no power of three.

17:44.209 --> 17:46.200
Oh, my God! Prue!

17:57.489 --> 17:59.286
Prue, stop that. Stop it!

17:59.449 --> 18:01.280
No, no, no.

18:01.449 --> 18:04.600
Very bad, Prue.
Very, very bad, Prue.

18:05.689 --> 18:07.645
Hi, Cujo. Who are you growling at?

18:07.969 --> 18:09.925
I'd better go check
with the Elders and see if they

18:10.089 --> 18:13.479
- know how to vanquish a Banshee.
- Don't tell me you're afraid of Prue?

18:13.689 --> 18:16.601
Wait a minute. Hold it. What if we find
the Banshee in the meantime?

18:16.809 --> 18:19.004
Well, you blew up the last demon
you fought, didn't you?

18:19.169 --> 18:20.966
Yeah, but I was trying to freeze him.

18:21.249 --> 18:24.207
Just remember what we talked about,
just try and relax.

18:26.489 --> 18:29.481
I really wish everybody
would quit telling me to relax.

18:31.609 --> 18:34.567
What is it? What is it?
What is it, girl?

18:36.209 --> 18:38.245
You think she hears the Banshee?

18:43.169 --> 18:45.080
Wait! Wait!

18:49.689 --> 18:51.327
This is worse than I thought.

18:51.729 --> 18:54.846
I never imagined anything like this
could ever happen to us.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.477
All I know is this can't
go on much longer.

18:57.649 --> 18:59.719
So, what are we gonna do?

18:59.889 --> 19:00.924
Rock, Paper, Scissors?

19:01.089 --> 19:04.718
- No way. You already lost.
- Two out of three.

19:07.649 --> 19:09.640
This is so humiliating.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.441
Phoebe.

19:19.489 --> 19:22.208
Does this mean
what I think it means?

19:23.289 --> 19:26.361
- It means I'm off the hook. Prue!
- Wait!

19:26.729 --> 19:30.244
Mom, Dad, are you there?
Pick up, please. It's me.

19:31.049 --> 19:32.607
Mom. Oh, thank God.

19:32.929 --> 19:35.489
I'm so sorry.
I never should have run away.

19:35.689 --> 19:37.520
I wanna come home.

19:44.329 --> 19:46.479
I don't know,
somewhere in San Francisco.

20:03.209 --> 20:04.847
Prue!

20:06.369 --> 20:09.441
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.
Okay, run. Run.

20:30.369 --> 20:31.518
Piper, now!

20:41.369 --> 20:43.280
- You okay?
- I think so, yeah.

20:47.689 --> 20:49.520
Prue, no, wait!

21:09.289 --> 21:10.802
Oh, God. Oh, no.

21:11.009 --> 21:15.048
Don't get up. Just stay there, baby.
You're all right. Good girl.

21:15.689 --> 21:17.486
Can somebody
give me a hand here?

21:17.649 --> 21:21.085
It's all right. Good girl. Good girl.

21:21.849 --> 21:23.282
Somebody, help!

21:25.089 --> 21:28.684
No, Darryl, I realise that you can't
put an APB out for a dog.

21:28.849 --> 21:32.478
But couldn't you at least ask the other
cops to keep an eye out for her?

21:32.929 --> 21:36.968
Yeah. Okay, that would be great.
Call Piper's cell if you hear anything.

21:37.569 --> 21:41.005
Bye. Do you think that the animal
shelters are even open this late?

21:41.209 --> 21:44.201
They'd better be, because this
is a disaster. I am very worried.

21:44.369 --> 21:48.044
Well, don't worry. We will find Prue,
and we will find the Banshee.

21:48.449 --> 21:50.280
At least we saved that girl.

21:50.569 --> 21:52.878
Yeah, and how are we
gonna save you?

21:53.489 --> 21:56.049
- What are you talking about?
- I'm talking about how the Banshee

21:56.209 --> 21:58.962
zeroed in on you even though
I was the one blowing up things.

21:59.609 --> 22:01.088
- So?
- So,

22:01.409 --> 22:03.684
the Banshee seeks out people
who are in great pain.

22:04.009 --> 22:07.081
- And apparently it thinks you are.
- Piper, that's ridiculous.

22:07.409 --> 22:10.287
Phoebe, you are not the first Halliwell
to fall in love

22:10.449 --> 22:11.928
with a demon and get burned.

22:12.249 --> 22:15.525
I know how much that hurts, which
means I know how much you hurt.

22:15.729 --> 22:18.482
But I think you're in denial.

22:20.169 --> 22:21.648
Okay.

22:22.089 --> 22:23.841
Well, if you'll forgive me, Dr. Laura,

22:24.169 --> 22:26.558
I have a different demon to worry
about at the moment.

22:26.729 --> 22:28.526
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?

22:28.809 --> 22:30.401
I'm gonna get the Book of Shadows

22:30.569 --> 22:32.525
so we can cast
the tracking spell on me.

22:32.689 --> 22:35.965
Wait. You wanna turn yourself
into a dog too?

22:36.169 --> 22:38.683
Do you know a better way to find
the Banshee and to find Prue?

22:39.129 --> 22:40.721
No. But...

22:40.929 --> 22:44.239
Then you will mind your business, and
I'm going to get the Book of Shadows.

23:30.889 --> 23:33.198
Well, there isn't any shelter open.

23:33.369 --> 23:34.882
This is an emergency.

23:35.129 --> 23:37.404
Well, there's gotta be some place.

23:40.249 --> 23:41.398
Never mind.

23:42.929 --> 23:44.282
We lost Prue.

23:44.649 --> 23:46.526
- What?
- She ran off

23:46.689 --> 23:47.963
after the Banshee attacked.

23:48.209 --> 23:49.767
Wait a minute.
You fought the Banshee

23:49.929 --> 23:52.807
- and you and Phoebe are okay?
- Yeah, fine. Why?

23:52.969 --> 23:56.245
Because the Elders just told me
that Banshees are former witches.

23:56.849 --> 23:58.567
- So?
- So the Banshee scream

23:58.729 --> 24:01.118
doesn't kill witches,
it turns them into Banshees.

24:05.409 --> 24:07.639
Why, Cole?

24:16.369 --> 24:17.848
Piper?

24:19.089 --> 24:20.841
Phoebe?

24:56.129 --> 24:57.562
Shut her up.

24:58.689 --> 25:00.441
Phoebe, you okay?

25:41.769 --> 25:43.122
Are you okay?

25:43.569 --> 25:45.287
Am I okay?

25:45.489 --> 25:48.481
Prue is a dog,
and Phoebe is a Banshee.

25:48.649 --> 25:51.482
I am not even in the vicinity of okay.

25:52.009 --> 25:53.283
How did this happen?

25:53.449 --> 25:54.677
What am I supposed to do?

25:54.849 --> 25:56.123
And you could have told me

25:56.289 --> 25:58.928
about the "witches turn
into Banshees" thing a little bit earlier!

25:59.129 --> 26:02.838
- Honey, just try and relax.
- Would you stop telling me to relax!

26:05.289 --> 26:07.086
That was Grams' sewing machine.

26:07.289 --> 26:09.086
Well, we don't have time
for you to lose it.

26:09.489 --> 26:12.925
Well, too bad, because I am losing it,
whether we have time for it or not.

26:13.089 --> 26:15.478
Listen to me. We have to save Phoebe
before she hurts anyone.

26:15.649 --> 26:17.958
If she kills just one person,
she stays a Banshee forever.

26:18.129 --> 26:20.438
Okay, could you give me
all the bad news at once?

26:20.609 --> 26:23.203
Do you have to keep doling it out
for dramatic effect?

26:23.369 --> 26:26.839
- We have to find Phoebe.
- How without Prue to track her?

26:27.129 --> 26:29.199
We'll find a way.
You can do this, Piper.

26:29.369 --> 26:31.007
No. Actually, I can't.

26:31.169 --> 26:33.239
See, because Prue and Phoebe
are the super witches,

26:33.409 --> 26:36.207
and I just tag along and freeze things.
Now I can't even do that right.

26:36.409 --> 26:39.401
That's not true.
You're just as strong as they are.

26:40.289 --> 26:41.642
I can't do it alone.

26:41.809 --> 26:44.960
You're not alone.
We're partners. Don't you see that?

26:46.969 --> 26:50.484
I'm sorry. It's just...
If anything happens to them...

26:50.769 --> 26:54.318
Nothing will happen.
We won't allow it.

26:54.969 --> 26:57.483
Where do we even begin?

26:58.169 --> 27:01.241
Start by taking a deep breath.
That's what your guru said, right?

27:03.049 --> 27:05.324
- Leo, that's not...
- Shut your eyes.

27:05.649 --> 27:07.765
Clear your mind.

27:08.769 --> 27:11.841
Listen to your instincts.
What are they telling you to do?

27:15.809 --> 27:18.164
I think I know what to do.

27:24.409 --> 27:25.683
Are you kidding?

27:26.329 --> 27:27.887
I'd love to go, but I can't.

27:28.249 --> 27:30.922
The vet said someone had
to keep an eye on the dog.

27:33.169 --> 27:35.399
Well, I got a soft spot for animals,
sue me.

27:36.529 --> 27:37.644
No, no tags.

27:37.849 --> 27:40.283
Maybe I should write an article
about irresponsible pet owners,

27:40.449 --> 27:41.928
make them feel like dirt.

27:42.409 --> 27:44.843
Hold it. I gotta go.

27:48.929 --> 27:50.965
Hey, what are you doing?

27:51.129 --> 27:52.881
You're supposed to be resting.

27:53.049 --> 27:55.438
No, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

27:56.289 --> 27:58.803
No, not until you're better.

28:02.409 --> 28:03.808
Yeah.

28:37.169 --> 28:38.488
Oh, Ramon.

28:38.649 --> 28:41.686
I was beginning to think
you stood me up.

28:53.409 --> 28:55.718
You like the imported stuff.

28:56.449 --> 28:58.167
That's my kind of girl.

29:02.369 --> 29:05.008
What is it? What's the matter?

29:06.969 --> 29:09.199
You're gonna wake the neighbours.

29:09.409 --> 29:11.559
Okay, okay. You want out, I get it.

29:13.009 --> 29:15.204
Here, hold on.

29:15.889 --> 29:17.447
Hey, come here.

29:20.609 --> 29:22.406
Come here!

29:22.769 --> 29:24.361
Piper, think this through, please.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.724
You were the one that told me
to trust my instincts.

29:27.009 --> 29:29.728
Yes, that was before you said you
were gonna summon Cole, though.

29:29.889 --> 29:31.561
Well, believe me,
it was not my first idea.

29:31.729 --> 29:33.321
Well, then what was your first idea?

29:33.489 --> 29:35.559
- Let's do that instead.
- That won't work. This will.

29:36.129 --> 29:38.404
The last time Cole was here,
he killed a witch, remember?

29:38.809 --> 29:40.037
That is what this is for.

29:40.209 --> 29:43.246
What if he makes his move before
you get a chance to vanquish him?

29:43.449 --> 29:46.361
- I'll freeze him.
- Now you're confident in your powers?

29:46.529 --> 29:48.565
Okay, so maybe I'll blow him up.

29:48.729 --> 29:50.640
But what if he blows us up first?

29:50.929 --> 29:53.204
Well, you're already dead.
What's the difference?

29:53.369 --> 29:55.439
The difference is that
I don't want you to join me.

29:56.849 --> 29:58.840
Leo, I love you,

29:59.009 --> 30:02.126
and it's because of you that I have
the courage to even attempt this.

30:02.329 --> 30:04.285
But we don't have any other options.

30:04.449 --> 30:06.724
Now, the Banshees target people
who are in pain.

30:06.969 --> 30:08.448
That's why it went after Phoebe.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.281
And Cole is the source
of Phoebe's pain.

30:10.449 --> 30:13.009
So if we can get him to find her
and eliminate that pain,

30:13.169 --> 30:15.160
then we might be able
to get Phoebe back.

30:15.449 --> 30:17.599
Do you really think he'll help us?

30:19.609 --> 30:22.282
Feelings like theirs don't go away.

30:23.409 --> 30:24.922
We should know.

30:32.409 --> 30:35.606
"Magic forces, black and white
Reaching out through space and light

30:35.889 --> 30:39.598
Be he far or be he near
Bring us the demon Belthazor here"

30:43.129 --> 30:44.847
You rang?

30:46.449 --> 30:49.009
Piper? Not the sister
I was expecting.

30:49.289 --> 30:51.883
Phoebe's in trouble.
She's been turned into a Banshee.

30:52.089 --> 30:54.319
A Banshee? Well, that's different.

30:55.449 --> 30:58.168
It happened because she was hurting,
over you.

30:58.849 --> 31:00.965
And I think you're the key
to turning her back.

31:01.169 --> 31:02.966
Sorry, I don't do good anymore.

31:03.129 --> 31:07.645
- Not even for somebody you love?
- "Loved." Past tense.

31:08.049 --> 31:09.880
I think we've heard enough.

31:10.649 --> 31:13.163
Feelings like that don't just die, Cole.

31:13.409 --> 31:16.606
Wrong. They died when Phoebe
gave up on me.

31:16.769 --> 31:18.487
Now all I can do is return the favour.

31:18.649 --> 31:20.958
You've helped us before.
And we have helped you.

31:21.169 --> 31:23.637
Oh, is that what you were doing
when you called me this morning,

31:23.809 --> 31:27.119
helping me?
Or trying to vanquish me?

31:27.489 --> 31:29.400
Piper, the potion.

31:30.849 --> 31:34.364
Phoebe loves you, Cole,
and I know that you love Phoebe.

31:34.609 --> 31:37.885
All I'm asking you to do is find her
and tell her.

31:38.129 --> 31:40.165
It's over, Piper,

31:40.529 --> 31:42.645
- in more ways than one.
- Throw the potion.

31:42.929 --> 31:44.726
You're right, Cole.

31:44.929 --> 31:46.647
It is over.

31:52.889 --> 31:55.039
Surprise.

31:59.129 --> 32:00.687
- But...
- Did you really think

32:00.929 --> 32:04.160
that I would come here without
magical protection? The question is,

32:04.689 --> 32:06.281
do you have any protection
for yourself?

32:06.449 --> 32:07.848
Don't threaten her.

32:08.049 --> 32:10.961
I suggest you orb her
out of here, whitelighter...

32:11.969 --> 32:14.244
...before there's nothing left to orb.

32:17.969 --> 32:19.721
- Prue?
- Prue?

32:28.809 --> 32:30.925
What's going on?

32:31.209 --> 32:33.279
Phoebe's home.

33:03.889 --> 33:05.117
You think she's all right?

33:05.449 --> 33:09.078
No, I don't.
Either way, Phoebe's screwed.

33:09.689 --> 33:12.283
I meant Prue.
She seems kind of down.

33:12.569 --> 33:16.005
Well, she should be.
We're about to lose a sister.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.121
I thought you said Cole
would never hurt her.

33:18.289 --> 33:19.688
In self-defence he would.

33:19.889 --> 33:21.925
Did you see her?
She was pissed off.

33:22.209 --> 33:25.679
On the other hand, if she kills him,
then she's a Banshee forever.

33:26.609 --> 33:28.725
This is all my fault.

33:29.369 --> 33:33.248
She zeroed in on Cole's pain for her.
I led her to him.

33:33.449 --> 33:35.485
Well, we found Prue.
We will find Phoebe.

33:36.929 --> 33:39.045
But how? And what if it's too late?

33:39.369 --> 33:41.246
Prue, would you be quiet.

33:42.009 --> 33:44.079
Maybe you should try scrying.

33:48.849 --> 33:51.317
She hears Phoebe.
Hurry! Hurry! Go, go, go!

34:28.369 --> 34:30.643
Don't make me kill you.

34:36.569 --> 34:38.321
Damn it, Phoebe.

34:38.889 --> 34:41.083
I love you.

35:11.409 --> 35:13.718
Prue! Prue!

35:13.929 --> 35:15.282
Prue?

35:16.169 --> 35:17.682
You're...

35:18.369 --> 35:20.166
- My hip.
- What happened?

35:20.329 --> 35:21.557
I had a little accident.

35:21.729 --> 35:24.448
Hey, Leo, not that I'm complaining,
but why am I human again?

35:24.649 --> 35:26.162
The spell must have played itself out.

35:26.329 --> 35:28.889
Phoebe must not be
a Banshee anymore.

35:29.409 --> 35:32.082
So does that mean
Phoebe's alive or?

35:36.249 --> 35:38.001
Stay away from me.

35:38.889 --> 35:41.687
Just stay away.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.561
- Phoebe.
- I don't wanna hear it, Cole.

35:43.769 --> 35:45.725
Yeah, you do.

35:45.889 --> 35:49.928
You're not the only one hurting here,
we both are.

35:50.609 --> 35:52.281
That's why we were drawn
into this mess.

35:54.249 --> 35:57.207
I tried to deny it too. I tried everything
to break my feelings for you,

35:57.369 --> 35:58.768
even magic.

35:59.329 --> 36:00.318
But nothing works.

36:00.529 --> 36:03.441
- Doesn't change anything.
- No.

36:04.449 --> 36:05.768
It doesn't.

36:06.569 --> 36:09.447
It doesn't change the fact
that I killed a witch,

36:10.409 --> 36:12.639
even if I was tricked into doing it.

36:13.449 --> 36:16.998
- What do you mean?
- Forget it, doesn't matter.

36:17.169 --> 36:19.285
Yeah, well, maybe it matters to me.

36:20.489 --> 36:24.721
Raynor cast a spell.
He made me kill her against my will.

36:26.049 --> 36:28.404
And why would he do that?

36:31.009 --> 36:32.840
Because he wanted to turn me.

36:34.049 --> 36:36.165
And he knew the only way to do that

36:36.809 --> 36:39.004
was to destroy the one thing
that was keeping me good.

36:39.649 --> 36:42.482
He knew that my killing a witch
would destroy your faith in me.

36:44.449 --> 36:45.723
And he was right.

36:50.769 --> 36:52.760
I don't know what to say.

37:00.849 --> 37:03.079
There's nothing to say.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.247
Like you said,

37:06.649 --> 37:09.880
it doesn't change the fact that I did it,

37:10.489 --> 37:13.322
or that we'll always love each other.

37:15.529 --> 37:18.043
I guess that's a pain
we'll both have to live with.

37:34.329 --> 37:35.682
I sense her.

37:36.409 --> 37:37.558
Phoebe's alive.

37:37.929 --> 37:39.920
So Phoebe-Banshee...

37:40.089 --> 37:41.238
Is Phoebe-Phoebe.

37:41.569 --> 37:43.287
Looks like your plan worked after all.

37:43.689 --> 37:45.202
Yeah, but if she had to
vanquish Cole,

37:45.369 --> 37:48.247
then she's probably not doing
very well. Why don't you go get her?

37:53.769 --> 37:56.237
- What are you doing?
- I think you got fleas.

37:56.409 --> 37:58.639
You know what, that's so not funny,
because I think I do.

37:58.809 --> 38:00.288
- I think you do.
- Okay,

38:00.769 --> 38:03.681
you have no idea how hard
it was being a dog.

38:03.849 --> 38:06.522
Okay? I mean peeing outside,

38:06.889 --> 38:11.599
eating everything and anything,
and just smelling everything.

38:11.769 --> 38:14.363
Must have been rough,
no pun intended.

38:15.929 --> 38:17.920
Well, at least I got to meet
a really cute guy.

38:18.089 --> 38:19.363
You met a guy?

38:19.529 --> 38:20.644
As a dog?

38:20.809 --> 38:23.642
- How?
- Well, he ran me over.

38:45.689 --> 38:47.247
Here you go.

38:47.809 --> 38:49.367
Thank you.

38:50.449 --> 38:52.565
You know, you might want
to raise the drink prices.

38:52.729 --> 38:53.844
Why?

38:54.569 --> 38:56.605
The bill from the window-repair guy.

38:59.169 --> 39:00.443
Ouch.

39:00.649 --> 39:03.288
Yeah, we really keep
that guy in business, don't we?

39:07.289 --> 39:08.722
Are you expecting someone?

39:08.889 --> 39:10.481
A certain journalist
with an empty fridge

39:10.649 --> 39:12.799
and a soft spot for man's best friend.

39:14.169 --> 39:17.002
He hits you, you hit on him.
It's only fair.

39:17.169 --> 39:21.799
Hey, how could I resist a guy who
put up fliers to find me? Excuse me.

39:27.409 --> 39:29.604
It's good to see you out.
It's been a while.

39:29.769 --> 39:31.407
Yeah, I guess
we're both out of hiding.

39:32.609 --> 39:34.998
- I've been wanting to thank you.
- For?

39:35.689 --> 39:37.088
Calling Cole.

39:37.529 --> 39:40.885
I mean if you hadn't,
I'd probably still be screaming.

39:41.289 --> 39:44.326
Yeah, well,
nothing like trusting your instincts.

39:44.729 --> 39:45.844
I know what you mean.

39:46.289 --> 39:48.883
I think I'm gonna act
on some of my own.

39:49.769 --> 39:51.999
Do I even wanna ask?

39:52.169 --> 39:54.763
I think I made a mistake
giving up on Cole.

39:55.649 --> 39:57.640
I now know why he did what he did.

39:58.489 --> 40:00.241
- Phoebe.
- He loves me.

40:01.289 --> 40:03.200
Which means that there's still good
in him.

40:04.329 --> 40:07.480
I can bring him back. I know I can.
