00:00.193 --> 00:01.759
<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:01.794 --> 00:03.139
<i>Where's the MTA footage</i>

00:03.173 --> 00:04.896
of Stahl on the subway?

00:04.930 --> 00:06.431
It's not him.

00:08.178 --> 00:09.745
<i>Harlee killed that prostitute.</i>

00:09.780 --> 00:11.481
<i>She is calculating.</i>

00:11.515 --> 00:12.982
<i>You know I may never see my son?</i>

00:13.016 --> 00:14.016
Ever again?

00:14.051 --> 00:16.385
She's not going
to lie her way out of this one.

00:16.420 --> 00:18.060
- What is this about?
<i>- Make her lie to you.</i>

00:18.094 --> 00:19.322
Ask her if she's ever killed anybody,

00:19.356 --> 00:21.357
Have you ever killed someone
and buried the body?

00:21.391 --> 00:24.527
The daughter died from a drug overdose

00:24.561 --> 00:25.995
when she was 19.

00:26.029 --> 00:29.999
<i>You're under investigation,
and the NYPD hates your guts.</i>

00:30.033 --> 00:32.034
- And you believe it?
- Does it matter?

00:32.069 --> 00:33.269
<i>What's this one going to cost me, Woz?</i>

00:33.303 --> 00:35.371
<i>I've been using the credit
cards to stay afloat,</i>

00:35.405 --> 00:36.506
but the ship is sinking.

00:36.540 --> 00:39.208
You've been taking the hit
for so long for Wozniak.

00:39.243 --> 00:41.177
Ramsey rewards loyalty

00:41.211 --> 00:44.514
Ramsey is in bed with Enrique
Ortiz and the Riohacha cartel.

00:44.548 --> 00:46.682
<i>I think I have something you want.</i>

00:46.717 --> 00:48.384
<i>A cartel leader's firstborn?</i>

00:48.418 --> 00:50.286
We can find a deal
that works for everyone.

00:50.320 --> 00:51.587
Cole doesn't know we burned him.

00:51.622 --> 00:54.123
<i>Now we're just trying
to avoid Ramsey killing him.</i>

00:54.157 --> 00:57.026
Ramsey knows your plan,
and now he has one of his own.

00:57.060 --> 00:58.694
This is a setup, let's go.

00:58.729 --> 01:00.796
<i>Attention all units,
Lieutenant Matt Wozniak</i>

01:00.831 --> 01:04.339
<i>is wanted in connection
to a terrorist attack.</i>

01:25.622 --> 01:28.724
- Anyone follow you?
- Would I be here if they did?

01:28.759 --> 01:30.226
Where's Woz hiding out?

01:30.260 --> 01:32.428
My place, he's radioactive.

01:32.462 --> 01:34.430
Are people buying
this terrorist cell crap?

01:34.464 --> 01:35.659
It's all over the scanner.

01:35.694 --> 01:37.333
Be grateful they have him flying solo.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.734
No mention of any of us.

01:38.769 --> 01:40.469
Cut off the head, the body dies.

01:40.504 --> 01:43.072
Not likely, your boss is going
to have to take us all on.

01:43.106 --> 01:45.441
Make sure you're on time
to the precinct tomorrow.

01:45.475 --> 01:46.742
We don't want to look suspicious.

01:46.777 --> 01:49.026
Yeah, on time might be suspicious.

01:53.650 --> 01:55.685
Did you pick up that travel cash?

01:55.719 --> 01:56.819
You can't go.

01:56.853 --> 01:58.263
So you're not my ride out of town?

01:58.297 --> 02:01.480
Can you just give me one day
to come up with a plan?

02:02.125 --> 02:03.759
If you run now, there's no play left.

02:03.794 --> 02:05.035
Running is the play.

02:05.069 --> 02:06.596
Well, Ramsey's going
to expect you to leave.

02:06.630 --> 02:08.830
He's going to have eyes everywhere.

02:08.865 --> 02:11.601
One day.

02:11.635 --> 02:13.450
Figure out your plan.

02:14.338 --> 02:16.703
If you don't hear from me, send flowers.

02:17.474 --> 02:19.241
Where?

02:31.922 --> 02:33.689
You weren't followed.

02:33.724 --> 02:36.492
They don't have to
follow me here to come looking.

02:36.526 --> 02:38.160
It's top of the list.

02:38.195 --> 02:39.795
I'm not going to stay long.

02:39.830 --> 02:41.797
Have you spoken to Linda
since becoming a fugitive?

02:41.832 --> 02:44.800
She's upstate,
waiting for the dust to settle.

02:44.835 --> 02:46.702
She's not happy about it.

02:46.737 --> 02:48.804
Christina refused to miss school, too.

02:48.839 --> 02:50.306
I gave Espada the assignment.

02:50.340 --> 02:52.742
Good, because peace talks are over.

02:52.776 --> 02:54.310
We don't have a lot of
leverage here, Woz.

02:54.344 --> 02:56.545
- We have Enrique.
- What we need is an ally.

02:56.580 --> 02:58.214
Cole knows where the bodies are buried.

02:58.248 --> 02:59.815
Well, where is he?

02:59.850 --> 03:01.456
I don't know.

03:01.885 --> 03:04.220
I'm just weighing the options,
so far he's the only one.

03:04.254 --> 03:05.821
He doesn't strike me as a hero,

03:05.856 --> 03:07.723
so I wouldn't count on him.

03:07.758 --> 03:09.825
I got to take Enrique someplace

03:09.860 --> 03:11.861
that Ramsey will never look.

03:11.895 --> 03:14.430
It's best if we're both on the move.

03:14.464 --> 03:16.232
- Where will you go?
- It's my city.

03:16.266 --> 03:18.334
I know all her dark corners.

03:21.772 --> 03:23.773
Time to find one of those corners.

03:25.976 --> 03:27.677
Detective Harlee Santos,

03:27.711 --> 03:30.913
this is a warrant to seize
your car for forensic evidence.

03:34.217 --> 03:35.851
Well, this escalated quickly.

03:35.886 --> 03:39.221
End of the line had to come sometime.

03:39.256 --> 03:40.890
If Internal Affairs wanted to squeeze us,

03:40.924 --> 03:43.559
Verco would have separated us by now.

03:43.593 --> 03:46.562
All right here we go. Deny, deny, deny.

03:46.596 --> 03:47.963
I look like a virgin to you?

03:47.998 --> 03:49.965
Hey, guys. Sorry to keep you waiting.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.368
Place is hopping,
there's a fugitive on the run.

03:52.402 --> 03:54.603
Right, Wozniak and his terrorist cell.

03:54.638 --> 03:56.872
Don't tell me you bought that
creative writing exercise.

03:56.907 --> 03:58.741
I try not to jump to conclusions.

03:58.775 --> 04:02.745
For instance, I was catching up on
this fender bender over breakfast.

04:02.779 --> 04:04.880
Says here you were
chasing a robbery suspect

04:04.915 --> 04:06.982
when you crashed into the U.S. Marshals

04:07.017 --> 04:10.720
accompanying Enrique Ortiz,
a man arrested by your unit.

04:10.754 --> 04:12.023
Oh, and look.

04:12.057 --> 04:14.957
It seems Enrique was
liberated from his transport

04:14.991 --> 04:16.959
three minutes after the collision.

04:16.993 --> 04:18.560
You know, it has more pop
when we tell it.

04:18.595 --> 04:19.680
I'm all ears.

04:19.714 --> 04:21.297
Well, now that you've ruined the ending.

04:21.331 --> 04:22.431
That's the point, officer.

04:22.466 --> 04:24.289
We're about to write the ending.

04:26.416 --> 04:28.003
We thought we recognized
one of the suspects

04:28.038 --> 04:29.739
from the wanted sheets
in the briefing room.

04:29.773 --> 04:32.408
We flashed our lights,
the guy took off running.

04:32.442 --> 04:33.909
Admission of guilt.

04:33.944 --> 04:35.778
So we gave chase in our patrol car.

04:35.812 --> 04:36.912
Not on foot?

04:36.947 --> 04:39.014
I ain't sprinting three blocks.

04:39.049 --> 04:41.417
I rolled through a stop sign,
and this unmarked...

04:41.451 --> 04:42.585
Describe the suspect.

04:42.619 --> 04:44.820
White male, late 20's, slim, maybe 5'8.

04:44.855 --> 04:46.922
Maybe 5'8? You're a cop,
you know what 5'8 looks like.

04:46.957 --> 04:47.990
What was he wearing?

04:48.024 --> 04:50.626
- It's all in the report.
- Then you should recall.

04:50.660 --> 04:52.661
- A hoodie.
- What color?

04:52.696 --> 04:55.931
Ehh, too late, accessory charges, gray.

04:55.966 --> 04:57.767
A gray hoodie is listed. Listen.

04:57.801 --> 04:59.668
Captain Pines is going to be
coming through this door

04:59.703 --> 05:02.338
in about five to seven minutes.
He may be bringing a member

05:02.372 --> 05:03.806
of the Intelligence Unit with him.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.808
They'll be looking for scalps.

05:05.842 --> 05:09.812
Details have never mattered
like they do this morning.

05:09.846 --> 05:12.014
We were in pursuit of a robbery suspect,

05:12.048 --> 05:15.317
White male, late 20's, slim build, 5'8.

05:15.352 --> 05:17.086
Gray hoodie.

05:18.889 --> 05:21.624
They impounded my car, you
couldn't give me a heads up?

05:21.658 --> 05:23.359
Gina Romero's murder
is not my investigation.

05:23.393 --> 05:26.351
No, finding Stahl is,
though you wouldn't know it.

05:26.863 --> 05:28.798
You shared information
that I confided in you.

05:28.832 --> 05:31.333
I was obligated to pass it on
to the investigative authority.

05:31.368 --> 05:32.835
I brought you the knife.

05:32.869 --> 05:34.537
Now you're trying to use it against me?

05:34.571 --> 05:36.038
You know how this works.

05:36.072 --> 05:37.876
They have to look into all leads.

05:40.443 --> 05:42.545
You get good reception in here?

05:44.114 --> 05:45.848
Some places.

05:47.684 --> 05:49.351
Like the interrogation room?

05:51.087 --> 05:53.489
Robert Stahl.

05:53.523 --> 05:55.964
- What about him?
- He's here.

05:58.094 --> 06:00.529
And maybe closer than I think.

06:07.871 --> 06:10.072
I thought Adrian would be at school.

06:10.106 --> 06:12.508
I'll take him
to his cousin's after lunch.

06:12.542 --> 06:14.777
They have a Playstation.

06:14.811 --> 06:17.413
Food break. Thanks, Mom.

06:17.447 --> 06:19.882
- Crust cut off the bread?
- Yes.

06:19.916 --> 06:21.350
Thank you.

06:32.796 --> 06:34.797
They're looking for Woz
in all the wrong places.

06:34.831 --> 06:37.867
Did Agent Myers deliver
that subway footage in person?

06:37.901 --> 06:39.869
- Who?
- Special Agent Myers, FBI.

06:39.903 --> 06:41.604
You took the package for me.

06:41.638 --> 06:44.006
No, it was a messenger, why?

06:45.909 --> 06:48.944
She was in Quantico with Stahl.

06:48.979 --> 06:50.646
Then he saved her life in the field,

06:50.680 --> 06:52.481
I think she's repaying the favor.

06:52.515 --> 06:55.584
- What makes you say that?
- The way she was interrogating me.

06:55.619 --> 06:57.753
I felt like I was
sitting across from him.

06:57.787 --> 07:01.557
The questions she asked,
the things that she knew.

07:01.591 --> 07:03.726
And then I saw an earpiece on her desk.

07:03.760 --> 07:05.461
Small enough to be invisible.

07:05.495 --> 07:06.785
That's a long shot.

07:08.498 --> 07:10.833
The warrant I requested
for the CCTV footage

07:10.867 --> 07:12.801
after Nava's death.

07:12.836 --> 07:14.904
I ignored it because I thought
I had seen the footage.

07:14.938 --> 07:15.838
You think it was a fake?

07:15.872 --> 07:18.908
Agent Myers may be able to alter a copy,

07:18.942 --> 07:21.210
but she can't erase the original.

07:24.648 --> 07:26.882
- What time?
- 11:37.

07:27.884 --> 07:29.952
I ignored my gut because
of a video I was sent

07:29.986 --> 07:31.587
by someone I didn't even know.

07:31.621 --> 07:34.857
It was the FBI, anyone would
have assumed it was true.

07:34.891 --> 07:36.425
There, stop.

07:36.459 --> 07:38.127
Play it from there.

07:40.797 --> 07:42.988
Look up, you son of a bitch.

07:47.837 --> 07:49.672
Harlee, that's him.

07:52.242 --> 07:53.876
You didn't believe me.

07:53.910 --> 07:55.778
It's okay.

07:55.812 --> 07:57.212
I didn't believe myself.

07:57.247 --> 07:59.671
Myers had me thinking I was crazy,

08:00.216 --> 08:01.706
So what now?

08:01.740 --> 08:03.572
Now I give her crazy.

08:11.399 --> 08:14.060
You pack enough for one day?

08:14.085 --> 08:16.754
Funny how all you need. Is one day away

08:16.788 --> 08:17.888
to make you start missing home.

08:17.923 --> 08:21.559
Nice of dad to arrange
a little vacation on the run.

08:21.593 --> 08:24.628
Well, I am not running anymore.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.768
Dad, you home?

08:30.802 --> 08:32.203
- Oh, good.
- Matt?

08:32.236 --> 08:34.071
You're home.

08:34.940 --> 08:36.207
What are you doing in my house?

08:36.241 --> 08:37.908
My job. Warrant's on the table.

08:37.943 --> 08:39.876
Warrant for what, what is this?

08:39.910 --> 08:41.979
When was the last time
you saw Matt Wozniak?

08:46.084 --> 08:47.651
Recognize him?

08:47.686 --> 08:49.887
- Thought you might.
- I don't understand...

08:49.921 --> 08:52.990
No, you don't, that's why
Agent Myers is here to explain.

08:53.024 --> 08:55.226
I'm just as lost as she is.

08:55.694 --> 08:57.661
Agent Myers sent me this.

08:57.696 --> 09:00.513
Same night, same footage. No Stahl.

09:00.548 --> 09:03.759
- I never sent you anything.
- Anything that wasn't doctored.

09:03.793 --> 09:06.737
What you're looking at is original
footage from the transit authority.

09:06.771 --> 09:08.005
Why haven't I seen this?

09:08.039 --> 09:09.173
The lab said it was corrupted.

09:09.207 --> 09:10.674
Show me the paperwork.

09:10.709 --> 09:13.244
In fact, show me
anything that you've done

09:13.278 --> 09:14.678
to track down Robert Stahl.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.347
Stahl in New York
certainly changes the focus

09:16.381 --> 09:17.982
of the Gina Romero investigation.

09:18.016 --> 09:19.750
I'll make sure that
your car is returned to you.

09:19.784 --> 09:21.752
I don't give a damn about my car.

09:21.786 --> 09:23.087
Arrest her.

09:23.121 --> 09:24.922
Gail.

09:24.956 --> 09:26.156
She knows where he is.

09:26.191 --> 09:28.292
She knows, and she's been helping him.

09:28.326 --> 09:30.995
I want Agent Stahl brought to
justice just as much as you do.

09:31.029 --> 09:33.330
You know, I've heard that line from you.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.865
You put an agent on finding Stahl

09:34.900 --> 09:35.933
who had a personal connection?

09:35.967 --> 09:38.035
Okay, this is delusional.
Director Baker knows

09:38.069 --> 09:40.004
that I was in the same
Quantico class as Stahl.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.545
That's why she put me on this
case, I can think like him.

09:42.579 --> 09:44.008
God, I hope not.

09:45.710 --> 09:46.844
You know one day, you're
going to look in the mirror

09:46.878 --> 09:49.280
and you're going to realize
that you helped a murderer

09:49.314 --> 09:51.950
stay free long enough to kill again.

09:52.918 --> 09:54.952
You have blood on your hands.

09:54.986 --> 09:56.954
I'll take it from here, Detective.

09:56.988 --> 09:58.689
It doesn't wash off.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.870
I was just thinking about you.

10:05.904 --> 10:08.065
Really? Were you thinking
about the full conduct review

10:08.099 --> 10:09.800
I was just hit with?

10:09.834 --> 10:11.835
You sent Harlee
doctored security footage?

10:11.870 --> 10:14.204
Look, hey, Katie, she was...

10:14.239 --> 10:16.874
- She was getting too close.
<i>- Well, she's closer now.</i>

10:16.908 --> 10:18.842
<i>She found the original.
You made a mistake.</i>

10:18.877 --> 10:21.345
<i>The whole FBI knows you're back.</i>

10:21.379 --> 10:22.980
<i>They only had Harlee's word before.</i>

10:23.014 --> 10:24.982
<i>Now they have proof I cannot erase.</i>

10:25.016 --> 10:27.318
Robert, you need to leave New York now.

10:27.352 --> 10:29.753
<i>You will be hunted down.</i>

10:41.066 --> 10:43.334
Well, Plan A didn't work out.

10:43.368 --> 10:45.336
You think I care?

10:45.370 --> 10:47.738
You got two choices, Enrique.

10:47.772 --> 10:51.241
Give me the name of the
person in your organization

10:51.276 --> 10:53.136
who can negotiate.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.914
Or I let the time run out.

11:01.086 --> 11:02.604
What happens then?

11:03.955 --> 11:05.222
Who knows?

11:08.793 --> 11:10.027
One minute.

11:11.930 --> 11:14.782
My people don't negotiate.

11:15.934 --> 11:19.069
Untie me and I might let you live.

11:19.104 --> 11:20.904
In case you've missed it,

11:20.939 --> 11:25.275
I'm the one whose standing in
between you and your freedom.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.946
Now, I have a good idea about
what's going to happen next.

11:28.980 --> 11:31.148
But I'm going to give myself a minute

11:31.182 --> 11:34.451
to see if I can come up
with something better.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.763
Because mine...

11:38.089 --> 11:40.266
Is very messy.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.128
And I hate messes.

11:50.301 --> 11:52.903
Mom, I have this whole
school thing going on.

11:52.937 --> 11:54.171
I'm sorry, I just wanted to tell you

11:54.205 --> 11:56.173
that Espada will be picking
you up after rehearsal tonight.

11:56.207 --> 11:58.776
Okay, that sounds fun, but that's a text.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.244
Why did you come all the way here?

12:02.534 --> 12:04.235
I needed a breath.

12:05.884 --> 12:07.851
Always helps to see you.

12:07.886 --> 12:09.920
Okay, well next time take a
breath like an hour later.

12:09.954 --> 12:11.188
Get me out of calc.

12:13.958 --> 12:16.302
Mom, is there a reason
you have me with Espada?

12:17.028 --> 12:19.722
Okay, never mind, you're
not going to answer that.

12:20.515 --> 12:22.166
How about...

12:22.517 --> 12:24.101
are you safe?

12:25.970 --> 12:27.137
I'm safe.

12:28.306 --> 12:30.900
Now go, get your butt to calculus.

12:33.478 --> 12:34.978
Bye.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.985
Tell me this isn't your one phone call.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.855
<i>Enrique agreed to give us an intro.</i>

12:44.889 --> 12:47.291
<i>Now's your chance to finish this.</i>

13:34.038 --> 13:35.506
You Rydel?

13:35.540 --> 13:37.174
For the purpose of this conversation.

13:37.208 --> 13:38.942
Have a seat.

13:43.148 --> 13:45.433
- Smoke?
- No.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.188
This one has quickly become my favorite.

13:51.222 --> 13:53.190
Family-owned tobacco farm.

13:53.224 --> 13:56.093
Hand-crafted, no shortcuts.

13:56.127 --> 13:57.737
No exceptions.

14:01.232 --> 14:03.600
- How's Enrique?
- Alive.

14:03.635 --> 14:07.037
And ready to be reunited with his daddy.

14:07.071 --> 14:09.439
You'll be compensated
for the transaction.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.214
That's a start.

14:17.248 --> 14:20.426
But money isn't the only ask.

14:21.085 --> 14:22.219
Two stipulations.

14:22.253 --> 14:24.254
One, once we deliver Enrique,

14:24.289 --> 14:26.557
your business dries up in Brooklyn.

14:26.591 --> 14:30.227
Two, you cut ties with Jordan Ramsey.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.665
I'm afraid you've misunderstood.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.400
This isn't a negotiation.

14:36.434 --> 14:38.569
If you want to see Enrique,

14:38.603 --> 14:41.071
that's exactly what this is.

14:41.105 --> 14:42.506
Just call your boss,
and let's get this done.

14:42.540 --> 14:44.408
There's no need. I know the answer.

14:44.442 --> 14:46.953
- This is his son.
- This is a business.

14:49.347 --> 14:52.583
Killing me doesn't change your situation.

14:52.617 --> 14:56.320
If your boss wants to see his son,

14:56.354 --> 14:58.956
make him see the light.

14:58.990 --> 15:01.551
Or Enrique never will.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.194
Take the money.

15:04.229 --> 15:06.097
Deliver Enrique.

15:06.497 --> 15:08.632
That's the only deal you're going to get.

15:11.369 --> 15:14.104
Then we don't have a deal.

15:21.980 --> 15:24.657
Large Kahlua cappuccino for Tess?

15:25.316 --> 15:28.318
Large Kahlua cappuccino for Tess?

15:36.194 --> 15:38.996
- Lucky guess.
- Hardly.

15:39.030 --> 15:41.965
Routines are easy to analyze,
it's all data.

15:42.000 --> 15:45.553
Life is much more predictable
than people think.

15:46.437 --> 15:48.138
I like to keep things fresh.

15:48.172 --> 15:50.641
I'm here to help. Have a seat.

15:52.543 --> 15:53.977
Does that seem likely to you?

15:54.012 --> 15:56.046
I have a lot of strings in my hand.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.025
All I have to do is pick one to pull.

15:59.684 --> 16:01.351
Or I can leave it alone,
and you can go back

16:01.386 --> 16:04.354
to worrying about little things
like the housing market.

16:04.389 --> 16:07.024
- Doesn't seem to help.
- A shame.

16:07.058 --> 16:09.192
Losing the house can't help you in court.

16:09.227 --> 16:11.061
You're offering to take care of my ex?

16:11.095 --> 16:12.872
I'm offering to take care of you.

16:13.564 --> 16:16.166
To the tune of "name your price."

16:17.769 --> 16:19.569
I want to know where Enrique is.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.672
And I won't hurt any of your friends,

16:21.706 --> 16:23.707
past what they'll wake up from.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.344
Unfortunately, I can't promise the same.

16:27.378 --> 16:30.781
Officer Nazario, all you have to
promise is to empty my bank account.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.762
Your turn to babysit, lucky you.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.831
I can think ofne of their
worse places to be.

16:47.865 --> 16:50.767
- Yo, you're late.
- I miss anything?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.136
Well, Sleeping Beauty's
been knocked out all day.

16:53.170 --> 16:54.771
And Karen ran out of snacks.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.540
- Because you ate them all.
- Ha, that's my cue.

16:57.575 --> 16:59.342
- Good night, man.
- All right, brother.

17:03.247 --> 17:04.488
Any way I can convince you

17:04.521 --> 17:06.759
to spend the night
at your cousin's with Adrian?

17:07.998 --> 17:10.465
You worried about me or him?

17:10.688 --> 17:13.223
We may be here longer than we thought.

17:14.515 --> 17:16.192
Then you're buying take out.

17:18.194 --> 17:19.229
Whoa, let her go!

17:19.262 --> 17:21.698
Easy, lover boy. Don't be stupid.

17:21.732 --> 17:23.366
She has nothing to do with this.

17:23.400 --> 17:24.777
Open the door.

17:27.338 --> 17:29.305
We can't keep Enrique hidden much longer.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.532
There's too much heat around us.

17:30.566 --> 17:32.342
Well, his father will come around.

17:32.376 --> 17:34.844
Even if Enrique needs to persuade him.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.414
- Woz!
- Where you going?

17:38.449 --> 17:39.916
Enrique escaped, he can't be far.

17:39.950 --> 17:42.252
A block, maybe less.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.678
You hit my car.

18:22.426 --> 18:25.929
Hey, Nate, you have a call
from Anna Kate on line two.

18:27.564 --> 18:29.365
Wait, what was the name again?

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
Anna Kate.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.737
Okay, thank you.

18:41.979 --> 18:44.414
This is Nate. <i>Hey, Nate.</i>

18:44.448 --> 18:47.517
Anything interesting on the news today?

19:14.445 --> 19:16.722
Robert, you scared me.

19:20.384 --> 19:21.684
You know, lots of parents

19:21.719 --> 19:23.052
keep their children's baby teeth.

19:24.788 --> 19:26.622
Doesn't look like a baby tooth.

19:28.058 --> 19:29.459
No.

19:35.833 --> 19:37.284
No, it doesn't.

19:38.335 --> 19:40.737
Who's is it?

19:44.641 --> 19:45.842
Miguel Zepeda.

19:47.545 --> 19:49.712
Harlee's ex.

19:49.747 --> 19:51.314
The man she murdered.

19:51.348 --> 19:53.449
The man who's murder
she tried to put on me.

19:53.484 --> 19:56.853
Katie, this is it.
This is the final piece.

19:56.887 --> 19:58.955
The last piece of evidence that we need.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.324
So why haven't you used it?

20:02.693 --> 20:04.027
Because it needs to be found

20:04.061 --> 20:06.462
in the right place, at the right time.

20:07.765 --> 20:08.998
By the right person.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.967
That's not me anymore.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.069
Do you understand what happened today?

20:13.103 --> 20:15.865
You know, I found this in a grave.

20:18.375 --> 20:20.009
I mean...

20:20.044 --> 20:22.912
I mean, that's kind of genius.

20:22.946 --> 20:26.916
Saperstein's grave, no one's
going to think to look there.

20:26.950 --> 20:29.018
Well, almost no one.

20:29.053 --> 20:31.988
- You have to leave town today.
- Listen to me.

20:32.022 --> 20:36.025
This proves that Harlee killed Miguel.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.027
And if I leave now,
then she gets away with it.

20:38.062 --> 20:40.563
She gets away with everything.

20:40.597 --> 20:42.065
When was the last time
you saw Gina Romero?

20:42.099 --> 20:45.001
Don't do that, don't let her
do that to you, Katie.

20:45.035 --> 20:48.337
She'll get in your head. Harlee
Santos distorts the truth.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.939
That's what she does.

20:49.973 --> 20:53.009
She killed Gina.
You're not thinking clearly.

20:53.043 --> 20:54.653
I think I am.

20:55.446 --> 20:56.913
Your frame job's over.

20:56.947 --> 20:59.849
Harlee's been cleared
of that prostitute's murder.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.792
You know, one thing that
I learned from Harlee.

21:09.827 --> 21:13.396
That the truth, it can be manipulated.

21:14.832 --> 21:16.133
Like a person.

21:16.834 --> 21:20.069
It can be used to betray us.

21:21.472 --> 21:24.516
Here you are,
you're harboring a wanted man.

21:25.476 --> 21:27.110
You're lying to your superiors about it.

21:27.144 --> 21:29.479
You've been faking evidence,
and it would be a shame

21:29.513 --> 21:31.357
if you were exposed.

21:32.015 --> 21:34.951
I believed you.
I was the only one who did.

21:34.985 --> 21:36.385
Then you plant the tooth on Harlee.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.488
I can't, Harlee doesn't trust me.

21:38.522 --> 21:40.890
Katie...

21:40.924 --> 21:43.759
- You can make this happen.
- No, no, it's over.

21:43.794 --> 21:47.964
- You need help.
- What I need is my life back.

21:47.998 --> 21:50.566
Run, Robert.

21:50.601 --> 21:52.068
- Disappear.
- I can't.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.504
Let me go!

21:54.538 --> 21:56.672
We are so close.

21:56.707 --> 21:58.509
We're so close.

21:59.042 --> 22:00.776
Let me go.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.115
- Damn it, we're so close.
- Let me go, please!

22:25.010 --> 22:26.409
I didn't think you'd call.

22:26.444 --> 22:29.112
Well, a girl gives me her number...

22:34.690 --> 22:36.686
- Is your phone off?
- I wasn't followed.

22:36.721 --> 22:38.288
You wouldn't know.

22:39.590 --> 22:41.624
What about Wozniak, is he still alive?

22:41.659 --> 22:43.560
And kicking.

22:43.594 --> 22:45.295
Holed up with Enrique.

22:45.936 --> 22:48.183
It's a strange feeling, being hunted.

22:48.566 --> 22:50.767
I used to look at the lights.

22:52.456 --> 22:54.857
Now I look at the darkness between them.

22:54.882 --> 22:56.516
It's like some unstoppable force,

22:56.541 --> 22:58.242
coming closer with every breath.

22:58.267 --> 22:59.945
I know the feeling well.

23:01.212 --> 23:02.846
Lived with it for a long time.

23:06.050 --> 23:07.717
Stahl?

23:07.752 --> 23:09.186
And Ramsey.

23:09.220 --> 23:12.022
And others before him
who tried to intimidate me

23:12.056 --> 23:13.690
into making mistakes.

23:13.724 --> 23:15.392
Waiting for me to let my guard down.

23:18.429 --> 23:20.397
Sometimes, I want to run, too.

23:27.305 --> 23:29.239
What keeps you here?

23:33.311 --> 23:35.412
I won't let them win.

23:39.283 --> 23:41.485
You know something, Detective Santos.

23:44.322 --> 23:46.450
You're singular.

23:48.326 --> 23:49.995
You could have left.

23:50.995 --> 23:52.498
What kept you here?

23:53.197 --> 23:56.399
You're stronger than you think, Cole.

23:57.835 --> 23:59.736
You made a choice

23:59.770 --> 24:03.073
when you gave me that lead
at the Sunrise Café.

24:03.107 --> 24:05.942
You wanted justice for your partner.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.846
And I want to do things right.

24:08.946 --> 24:10.814
But I can't do it alone.

24:16.287 --> 24:17.988
Okay.

24:20.458 --> 24:22.653
Okay, if you still want my help.

24:24.028 --> 24:25.996
I'll come forward.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.764
They might not give you a deal.

24:27.798 --> 24:29.785
It doesn't matter.

24:30.301 --> 24:32.135
There's no immunity from Jordan Ramsey.

24:32.170 --> 24:34.971
But that doesn't mean
that I have to let him win.

24:35.973 --> 24:38.008
So what's the play?

24:38.042 --> 24:41.111
Strike quickly, catch him off guard.

24:42.813 --> 24:46.349
You can't count on a jury.
I mean, even with my testimony.

24:46.384 --> 24:49.152
He'll find a way out,
he has contacts everywhere.

24:49.187 --> 24:50.487
He won't be able to use them.

24:50.521 --> 24:53.016
Not if it's done out in the open.

24:53.591 --> 24:55.769
We need to do this in public.

25:05.336 --> 25:07.237
Try that again,

25:07.271 --> 25:11.141
and I'll introduce you
to a shell from this gun.

25:17.882 --> 25:20.586
Daddy doesn't want you back.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.420
It hurts, doesn't it?

25:23.454 --> 25:26.223
Well, guess what?

25:26.257 --> 25:28.594
I don't want you, either.

25:29.227 --> 25:33.897
So don't give me a reason
to send you into the abyss.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.907
And here's a preview.

25:49.480 --> 25:52.249
You remembered Jay was a realtor.

25:52.283 --> 25:54.351
I'm a good listener.

25:54.385 --> 25:56.286
No, you're not.
You just needed something.

25:56.320 --> 25:59.055
I'm being set up, Nate.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.523
I'm not a criminal.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.559
Yeah, maybe not today.

26:05.229 --> 26:06.792
If that's hard to hear, it must resonate.

26:06.826 --> 26:09.199
It's hard to hear
because it's you saying it.

26:09.233 --> 26:11.034
What do you expect, dad? Nothing changes.

26:11.068 --> 26:12.498
You send us out of town,

26:12.532 --> 26:14.204
and you say that's a good day's work.

26:14.238 --> 26:15.872
But why not choose differently?

26:15.906 --> 26:18.308
I don't have control over this.

26:18.342 --> 26:20.277
I'm not three steps ahead,

26:20.311 --> 26:23.480
I don't even have
my pieces all on the board.

26:23.514 --> 26:26.049
So stop playing the game, Dad.

26:26.083 --> 26:27.986
Just stop.

26:28.252 --> 26:29.252
Here.

26:31.455 --> 26:32.889
It's an op-ed I'm working on.

26:32.923 --> 26:34.743
Let me know if you want to comment.

26:35.619 --> 26:37.494
"My father was a police officer

26:37.528 --> 26:39.496
as long as I can remember.

26:39.530 --> 26:41.464
Now I'm not sure what he is."

26:41.499 --> 26:44.100
- Nate...
- I'll submit it anonymously.

26:45.202 --> 26:47.337
I'm going to go check on Mom.

26:47.371 --> 26:49.639
Tell her that I love her and I'm sorry.

26:49.674 --> 26:52.075
Maybe add a little poetry to it.

26:52.109 --> 26:54.311
You know what, dad,
whatever's going on right now,

26:54.345 --> 26:56.079
it's only going
to come down to two choices.

26:56.113 --> 26:58.581
You either do the right thing,
or you do something else.

26:58.616 --> 27:02.585
Black and white is a lazy way
to see the world.

27:05.822 --> 27:07.490
You've always been a hard worker.

27:10.561 --> 27:12.128
<i>This could easily backfire.</i>

27:12.163 --> 27:13.963
You are already under heavy scrutiny.

27:13.998 --> 27:16.199
That's why I need to explain
everything on record.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.335
Detective, you were
just cleared of murder.

27:18.369 --> 27:20.203
Your boss is a wanted man.
Do you think right now

27:20.237 --> 27:21.938
might be a good time
to keep a low profile?

27:21.972 --> 27:25.275
I have a witness who can help
bring Jordan Ramsey down.

27:25.309 --> 27:27.462
Does this witness have a name?

27:28.212 --> 27:29.459
Not until he testifies

27:29.493 --> 27:31.314
in front of the Commission
on Police Corruption.

27:31.349 --> 27:32.949
What commission is that?

27:32.983 --> 27:34.366
The one you're pitching to your boss.

27:34.401 --> 27:37.153
Top brass don't take a piss
without knowing the details.

27:37.188 --> 27:38.423
You have a rat.

27:38.457 --> 27:41.324
I give you the witness's name, he's dead.

27:41.359 --> 27:44.327
Even if I'm inclined to help,
this is more than I can deliver.

27:44.362 --> 27:46.129
Then tell him I want to testify.

27:46.163 --> 27:48.164
They're going to ask you real questions.

27:48.199 --> 27:50.734
You are going to be in real
legal jeopardy if you do that.

27:50.768 --> 27:53.280
I already have a target on my back.

27:54.071 --> 27:55.699
I'm not stopping.

27:59.410 --> 28:00.643
I'll make a few calls.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.706
I need you to make a few more.

28:03.381 --> 28:05.982
I need you to broker a trade
with the Feds

28:06.016 --> 28:07.217
for a wanted cartel member.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.321
In exchange for what?

28:11.355 --> 28:13.118
No blowback, no questions asked.

28:13.153 --> 28:15.558
Right. Tell Wozniak I said hi.

28:15.593 --> 28:18.361
Enrique Ortiz in custody
is a win-win for everybody.

28:18.396 --> 28:20.599
Just see this through with us.

28:21.065 --> 28:23.400
Like I said, I will make a few calls.

28:25.770 --> 28:27.689
Detective.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.734
I hope you know what you're doing.

28:31.375 --> 28:33.319
Not as much as I do.

28:38.805 --> 28:41.639
See, I'm not alone.

28:45.577 --> 28:47.709
My first day, what was the lesson?

28:48.380 --> 28:49.647
Two is better than one.

28:51.717 --> 28:54.485
And a crew is better than two.

28:54.519 --> 28:56.320
Remember that?

28:56.355 --> 28:57.677
It's why I'm staying.

28:58.757 --> 29:01.225
There's a manhunt for me.

29:01.259 --> 29:02.727
Just me.

29:02.761 --> 29:05.289
If this place gets raided...

29:05.290 --> 29:06.462
I'm done.

29:06.496 --> 29:09.193
But I'm not bringing you down with me.

29:14.065 --> 29:16.100
That's an order.

29:17.268 --> 29:18.865
Yes, Lieutenant.

29:26.478 --> 29:28.112
Okay.

29:46.998 --> 29:50.730
"My father was a police officer
as long as I can remember.

29:51.302 --> 29:53.567
"Now I'm not sure what he is.

29:54.205 --> 29:57.274
"I see the same blues, the same badge,

29:57.308 --> 29:59.612
"But I have no sense
of what they mean to him.

29:59.647 --> 30:01.411
If anything."

30:04.149 --> 30:07.317
He always did have a way with words.

30:08.386 --> 30:10.554
Must have got it from Mom.

30:14.492 --> 30:16.673
'Cause right now...

30:17.996 --> 30:20.842
The only words that I can think to say...

30:21.666 --> 30:25.235
- Are...
- Ones you don't need to say.

30:30.074 --> 30:32.609
I've tried to save you.

30:34.245 --> 30:36.413
So many times.

30:38.316 --> 30:40.484
Every case,

30:40.518 --> 30:43.453
every girl that gets in trouble.

30:43.488 --> 30:45.155
I know.

30:45.190 --> 30:47.662
Drugs on the playground...

30:48.660 --> 30:50.394
Harlee...

30:50.428 --> 30:52.000
Christina.

30:58.369 --> 31:01.205
- It's all you.
- No, dad.

31:03.174 --> 31:04.608
It's you.

31:07.178 --> 31:09.313
I can't lose you again.

31:09.347 --> 31:13.283
You're never going to lose me.

31:15.520 --> 31:18.488
But you need to find yourself.

31:23.394 --> 31:27.197
"My father was a police officer
as long as I can remember."

31:41.479 --> 31:42.713
Harlee.

31:42.747 --> 31:44.848
I think Verco went for the Enrique deal.

31:44.883 --> 31:47.517
Though to be honest,
I'm not sure why you did.

31:47.552 --> 31:50.520
It just seemed
like the right thing to do.

31:50.555 --> 31:52.389
You're full of surprises.

31:52.860 --> 31:54.183
<i>How you holding up?</i>

31:56.628 --> 31:59.229
- Woz?
<i>- I'm here.</i>

32:00.298 --> 32:01.798
I'm here.

32:01.833 --> 32:04.101
I think I may have a plan

32:04.135 --> 32:07.304
to handle Ramsey
through official channels.

32:07.659 --> 32:10.540
Yeah, get some rest, I'll pick
you up in the morning.

32:12.610 --> 32:15.579
Christina?

32:24.289 --> 32:26.052
Christina.

32:42.440 --> 32:43.907
There's, uh...

32:43.942 --> 32:46.276
There's only one conclusion I can draw

32:46.311 --> 32:48.278
from the evidence at hand, Harlee.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.449
You're untouchable.

32:54.218 --> 32:56.787
You see, you lie and you con your way

32:56.821 --> 32:58.455
through our partnership.

32:58.489 --> 33:01.892
You heist millions of dollars
out from under my nose.

33:03.461 --> 33:06.663
You murder your ex-boyfriend
in this room.

33:08.967 --> 33:10.680
And I can't get you for it.

33:13.538 --> 33:15.505
You let Saperstein die.

33:15.540 --> 33:18.608
You deceive your own daughter.

33:20.578 --> 33:22.312
No punishment.

33:22.347 --> 33:24.815
Is that why you're doing all this?

33:24.849 --> 33:26.283
Penance?

33:26.317 --> 33:27.584
Harlee, how many times
do I have to tell you?

33:27.618 --> 33:30.921
You'll never be healed if you
don't face your transgressions.

33:33.391 --> 33:35.225
Gina deserved a better ending.

33:35.259 --> 33:36.660
Yeah, Gina deserved a better ending.

33:36.694 --> 33:38.729
Gina deserved a better life.

33:38.763 --> 33:41.465
She had a pure heart
in that used up body.

33:42.934 --> 33:44.714
And yet you.

33:46.216 --> 33:47.971
You're still breathing air.

33:50.241 --> 33:52.843
- Doesn't seem fair.
- Nothing is.

33:52.877 --> 33:54.443
What do you know about it?

33:54.477 --> 33:57.247
You don't know what it is to
lose something that you want.

33:57.281 --> 33:59.750
You've never experienced it.

33:59.784 --> 34:01.685
And don't tell me about your boyfriend,

34:01.719 --> 34:03.775
'cause you wanted to want him.

34:04.389 --> 34:05.989
I'm amazed he believed you at all.

34:06.024 --> 34:07.987
You know who else believed me?

34:08.559 --> 34:09.947
Gail Baker.

34:10.395 --> 34:12.728
The FBI knows that you're back.

34:12.764 --> 34:14.744
And they're coming after you.

34:15.233 --> 34:16.900
Not even Katie Meyers can help you.

34:16.934 --> 34:18.594
Yeah, she turned on me.

34:23.306 --> 34:25.375
I guess we're all out of witty banter.

34:28.780 --> 34:30.580
The first one's for you.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.949
- And the next one's for me.
- No one has to die tonight.

34:33.985 --> 34:35.284
Don't you get it?

34:35.319 --> 34:38.621
We were always meant to be connected.

34:41.926 --> 34:44.728
- This was inevitable.
- You're right, it was.

34:44.762 --> 34:47.998
But listen to me,
because I owe you this much.

34:49.266 --> 34:51.781
I am a better person because of you.

34:52.969 --> 34:56.572
I'm a better mother because of you.

34:56.607 --> 34:59.709
You, you have changed me.

35:01.312 --> 35:02.479
We've changed each other.

35:02.513 --> 35:04.981
When I have a choice between
what's right and what's easy,

35:05.016 --> 35:08.285
I think of you.

35:08.319 --> 35:11.254
I'm a better person because I've met you.

35:11.289 --> 35:12.789
Harlee, you can't even look at me.

35:12.824 --> 35:15.425
That's because I see
my reflection in your eyes.

35:15.460 --> 35:17.961
I see how you see me.

35:17.995 --> 35:21.064
Wasted potential, sullied, dirty.

35:21.099 --> 35:22.599
I feel it.

35:22.633 --> 35:26.336
Just please, please. No more blood.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.026
This is different.

35:28.973 --> 35:30.841
It's going to be okay.

35:30.875 --> 35:33.310
This is going to clean everything away.

35:33.344 --> 35:35.241
This is my last gift.

35:35.813 --> 35:38.949
Stahl, wait.

35:40.351 --> 35:41.789
Hi, Mom.

35:42.987 --> 35:44.287
Hi, sweetheart.

35:47.086 --> 35:48.758
How was rehearsal?

35:48.793 --> 35:51.862
Fine. Someone was out of tune.

35:51.896 --> 35:54.093
I had fun with Espada though.

35:58.035 --> 35:59.636
She'll never forget this mess.

35:59.670 --> 36:03.006
Stahl, just walk out of here.

36:03.040 --> 36:06.109
- I will let you go.
- No, Harlee.

36:08.358 --> 36:10.347
I won't have that.

36:10.381 --> 36:11.515
I won't have you letting me go.

36:11.549 --> 36:13.116
Sorry.

36:13.151 --> 36:15.418
I forgot I owed you a hug.

36:17.688 --> 36:19.589
Don't hesitate.

36:39.251 --> 36:40.952
Christina, get behind the wall.

36:40.986 --> 36:42.287
- Mom...
- Now!

36:45.391 --> 36:46.724
Don't move.

36:59.038 --> 37:01.806
I'm glad it was you.

37:13.452 --> 37:15.086
Mom, is he dead?

37:15.633 --> 37:16.821
Yes.

37:19.525 --> 37:21.514
Well, what are we going to do?

37:31.136 --> 37:33.438
We call the police.

37:33.472 --> 37:36.341
Don't move, get back.

37:42.081 --> 37:45.083
<i>911 operator, what's your emergency?</i>

37:45.117 --> 37:47.118
My name is Detective Harlee Santos.

37:47.152 --> 37:49.834
I'm an off duty police officer.

37:50.456 --> 37:53.558
I just shot and killed
an intruder in my home.

38:15.814 --> 38:17.081
You good?

38:17.116 --> 38:18.449
No.

38:18.484 --> 38:20.285
But I'm a step closer.

38:20.319 --> 38:22.954
I was listening
to the scanner, keeping tabs.

38:22.988 --> 38:25.556
Seeing if they have any leads
on the search for Woz.

38:25.591 --> 38:27.925
And you heard this address?

38:27.960 --> 38:30.161
Apartment in Greenpoint.

38:30.195 --> 38:31.562
Homicide.

38:31.597 --> 38:33.431
Black woman, 30's.

38:33.465 --> 38:36.467
Identified as an FBI agent.

38:36.881 --> 38:39.175
No doubt he was coming for you.

38:40.205 --> 38:41.306
I got that feeling.

38:41.340 --> 38:43.274
There's no gray here.

38:43.309 --> 38:46.611
Stahl came into your
apartment with nothing to lose.

38:53.152 --> 38:54.485
He was never walking out.

38:54.520 --> 38:56.187
Good.

38:56.221 --> 38:59.123
Just so we understand,
you did the right thing.

39:00.959 --> 39:02.281
Christina, you ready?

39:04.863 --> 39:06.831
All right, I'll call you back.

39:06.865 --> 39:08.193
I just spent the last ten minutes

39:08.227 --> 39:10.540
trying to convince Woz
not to come over here.

39:14.006 --> 39:15.973
Baby, get in the car.

39:16.008 --> 39:17.308
Get in the car.

40:16.468 --> 40:18.369
I'm okay.

40:18.404 --> 40:19.971
I know.

40:21.573 --> 40:23.674
And I'm sure you have a lot of questions.

40:23.709 --> 40:25.364
It's over.

40:26.111 --> 40:27.700
He can't hurt you anymore.

40:29.248 --> 40:30.715
Baby, I'm so sorry.

40:30.749 --> 40:32.538
No, mom.

40:33.873 --> 40:36.521
I'm sorry, okay?

40:36.555 --> 40:38.256
I'm sorry I doubted you.

40:38.290 --> 40:41.025
And I made it so hard
for you to protect me.

40:41.059 --> 40:44.262
It wasn't fair that I put you
in danger in the first place.

40:44.296 --> 40:46.063
Mom, I need you to listen to me.

40:46.098 --> 40:48.266
And believe what I tell you.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.640
This is not your fault.

40:51.136 --> 40:52.703
None of this is your fault.

40:55.441 --> 40:58.576
- Baby, I wish that were true.
- It is.

40:58.610 --> 41:01.484
Believe it. Accept it.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.548
And move on.

41:05.350 --> 41:06.617
You understand?

41:11.323 --> 41:12.690
Good.

41:15.627 --> 41:18.095
You take the bathroom first.

41:18.130 --> 41:19.564
I'm going to unpack.

41:19.598 --> 41:22.033
Okay.

41:28.307 --> 41:29.540
Go.
