Sam?Y e a h .

08:25.689 --> 08:26.896
She's, like, settled down now.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.310
She found a really good guy
and she's--

08:28.379 --> 08:29.931
I don't think
she wants to relive

08:30.000 --> 08:32.724
the Ronnie-Sam stuff.
Oh.

08:32.793 --> 08:34.206
I'm really sad
Sam isn't, you know,

08:34.275 --> 08:35.689
coming to Miami with us.

08:35.758 --> 08:37.137
I'm the sweetest bitch
you'll ever meet,

08:37.206 --> 08:38.517
but do not  with me.

08:38.586 --> 08:41.448
I tried to get her
to come so many times.

08:41.517 --> 08:43.827
Stop! Stop it!
Get out then!

08:43.896 --> 08:45.931
How about you do you,
I'll do me?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.655
And I could tell she was just
so over, you know,

08:48.724 --> 08:50.793
living in a house
with a whole bunch of people.

08:50.862 --> 08:53.103
You will never find
someone like me.

08:53.172 --> 08:55.103
She's really happy
with who she's with.

08:55.172 --> 08:56.896
So, you know, I was like,
all right, I get it.

08:56.965 --> 08:58.551
Sam and Ron are done.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.517
But I'm really sad
she's not gonna be here,

09:00.586 --> 09:02.344
and I hope she doesn't
regret not coming.

09:02.413 --> 09:04.310
No more tears
for Sammi Sweetheart.

09:04.379 --> 09:06.000
Cheers to how your lives
turned out

09:06.068 --> 09:07.724
by working at the Shore Store.

09:07.793 --> 09:08.931
Thank you, Danny,
for shaping our life.Thank you, Danny!

09:09.000 --> 09:10.620
By working here,
you all met husbands.

09:10.689 --> 09:12.137
Thank you.

09:12.206 --> 09:13.793
All right,
I gotta go .

09:13.862 --> 09:15.172
That's nice.

09:15.241 --> 09:16.965
Actually, I don't really
need to poop.

09:17.034 --> 09:18.482
I have something else
up my sleeve.

09:18.551 --> 09:20.448
Oh my goodness,
oh my goodness, oh my goodness.

09:20.517 --> 09:22.275
I feel like we need to bring
a little Jersey to Miami.

09:22.344 --> 09:26.482
So I'm like, Danny, bitch,
we're raiding your shore house.

09:26.551 --> 09:29.551
Eww!

09:29.620 --> 09:32.862
Do you remember me?

09:32.931 --> 09:36.137
My little baby!

09:36.206 --> 09:39.068
Eww, it's probably dirty.

09:39.137 --> 09:41.965
Do you remember
our times together?

09:42.034 --> 09:44.241
You were such an ,
and now I love you.

09:45.689 --> 09:47.344
There we go.

09:50.344 --> 09:52.172
What up, what up, what up?Yo!

09:52.241 --> 09:53.758
How you doing?
Got my new coat on.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.206
What's up, buddy
What is that, chinchilla?

09:55.275 --> 09:56.827
What's up, brother?
Look at you, man.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.689
I gotta take my glasses off
and see you all shined up, man.

09:58.758 --> 10:00.379
Look at you.You lost that baby fat.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.034
Yeah, bro. Baby fat.

10:02.103 --> 10:03.965
You know what I mean?
Looking good.What's going on, bro?

10:04.034 --> 10:06.413
Since last time you saw me
at the shore,

10:06.482 --> 10:08.517
I am a completely
different person than I was.

10:08.586 --> 10:11.862
I mean, I'm super into
nutrition and the way I eat.

10:11.931 --> 10:13.551
I hear The Situation's
under construction, right?

10:13.620 --> 10:15.310
The Situation
is under construction.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.068
All right.It will take
a little bit of time.

10:17.137 --> 10:19.275
Okay, so, let's construct it.

10:19.344 --> 10:21.241
I'm working out now,
trying to get abs.

10:21.310 --> 10:23.931
I feel the best I've ever felt,
mentally, physically,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.000
spiritually,
emotionally, everything.

10:26.068 --> 10:27.586
You look great, bro.
You're like a new person.

10:27.655 --> 10:29.344
I know that you're all into
bettering yourself now

10:29.413 --> 10:30.724
and everything.Oh, yeah, man.

10:30.793 --> 10:32.965
We used to just look at
the outside of The Situation,

10:33.034 --> 10:35.068
now we're looking
at the inside.We're going full package now.

10:35.137 --> 10:37.068
Since the last time
you've seen The Situation,

10:37.137 --> 10:40.103
I was pretty much just a shell
of the person I am today.

10:40.172 --> 10:42.068
Today, The Situation
lives with integrity.

10:42.137 --> 10:43.862
I don't lie, I don't cheat,
I don't steal,

10:43.931 --> 10:45.517
I don't drink,
I don't drug.

10:45.586 --> 10:46.862
I'm a top mans today.

10:46.931 --> 10:48.724
So, yo,
you ready to go?

10:48.793 --> 10:49.965
Yeah, man,
I'm ready to go, man.

10:50.034 --> 10:52.034
I'm real excited, man,
'cause I thought y'all

10:52.103 --> 10:54.068
was gonna go without me, man,
you know what I mean?

10:54.137 --> 10:55.379
We would never go
without you, bro.

10:55.448 --> 10:56.931
You know we made
this pact together.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.172
Can't go without you.Yeah, I know,
but I couldn't leave

10:58.241 --> 10:59.896
the country and then I--I heard.

10:59.965 --> 11:01.827
Yeah, I couldn't leave
the country, I got this
little court situation.

11:01.896 --> 11:03.793
How's that looking?

11:03.862 --> 11:05.448
It's rough out there in
the streets, you know
what I mean?

11:05.517 --> 11:08.586
Right now, I'm going through
a major federal court case.

11:08.655 --> 11:10.965
I am being accused
of tax evasion,

11:11.034 --> 11:12.413
and I'm trying to move forward.

11:12.482 --> 11:15.620
I have respect for the system,
the judge, the process,

11:15.689 --> 11:18.931
and faith in God that I'm gonna
move forward one day at a time.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.034
I've dealt with this
case for four years.
Mm-hmm.

11:21.103 --> 11:22.862
And if I gotta take
my medicine or do some time,

11:22.931 --> 11:24.655
I gotta do it,
you know what I mean?
Yeah.

11:24.724 --> 11:26.310
I'm definitely afraid
for Mike.

11:26.379 --> 11:29.206
I mean, it sucks because
he's in the best place
of his life,

11:29.275 --> 11:30.827
he totally changed
his life around.

11:30.896 --> 11:32.620
So I really do
feel bad for him.

11:32.689 --> 11:33.896
Like I said, yo,
I'm always here for you.

11:33.965 --> 11:35.068
Thank you, brother.And supporting you.

11:35.137 --> 11:36.344
I don't want that
happening to my friends.

11:36.413 --> 11:37.310
Yeah, no, I know, brother.

11:39.413 --> 11:41.655
Can we get dinner please
Yes, let's go.

11:41.724 --> 11:43.448
You guys are gonna die.
Are you ready?

11:43.517 --> 11:44.758
Why?

11:44.827 --> 11:46.413
I stole something
from the shore house.

11:46.482 --> 11:47.931
You ready?
What?

11:48.000 --> 11:49.586
Quack, quack, quack!

11:49.655 --> 11:51.965
Oh, my God!
Stop!

11:52.034 --> 11:53.000
No, no!

11:53.068 --> 11:54.586
Hi, guys, I'd like
to order a cab.

11:54.655 --> 11:56.034
Yeah!

11:56.103 --> 11:58.000
Danny's gonna kill us,
but it's  awesome.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.965
We're gonna have the duck phone
in Miami.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.310
The duck phone
is like our pet.

12:08.448 --> 12:10.413
That would look like
a freaking disaster.

12:10.482 --> 12:12.655
Like...
Eww.

12:12.724 --> 12:14.517
Ooh, you look sexy.

12:14.586 --> 12:15.655
No.Jenni is sexy.

12:15.724 --> 12:16.793
Aww...Titty mama!

12:16.862 --> 12:18.551
Nicole!

12:18.620 --> 12:20.137
I can do that,
I'm her sister.

12:20.206 --> 12:22.724
Motherhood has definitely
not slowed Nicole down.

12:22.793 --> 12:24.206
I don't think Nicole
will ever slow down.

12:24.275 --> 12:26.862
Would you consider
me and Nicole a sister?

12:26.931 --> 12:28.275
Of course.

12:28.344 --> 12:31.620
Would you consider Pauly, Ron,
Vinny, and Mike brothers?

12:31.689 --> 12:33.793
Yeah.
Same.

12:33.862 --> 12:36.172
I'm a little nervous to see Ron

12:36.241 --> 12:38.137
because me and Ron did have
a little bit of a hiccup.

12:38.206 --> 12:39.689
When my dad passed away,

12:39.758 --> 12:41.482
Ron didn't reach out
to me at all.

12:41.551 --> 12:43.689
My dad was,
like, my best friend
and everybody knew it.

12:43.758 --> 12:45.068
It, like, really broke my heart.

12:45.137 --> 12:46.379
Let's call Mike
and see what he says.

12:46.448 --> 12:49.379
Let's call him.
It's been way too long.

12:49.448 --> 12:50.517
Yo.

12:50.586 --> 12:52.689
Yay!
Mike!
Shh!

12:52.758 --> 12:54.275
Oh, my God, I apologize.

12:54.344 --> 12:55.413
I'm so sorry.Hi, Mike!

12:55.482 --> 12:56.724
So sorry for that.

12:56.793 --> 12:58.310
They are the absolute
worst human beings.

12:58.379 --> 12:59.448
Me

12:59.517 --> 13:01.896
My roommates are crazy.Hey, Mike!

13:01.965 --> 13:03.724
I was just getting out of the shower.

13:03.793 --> 13:05.103
Are you so ready?

13:08.482 --> 13:09.793
Oh, don't be nervous.Why you nervous?
Weirdo.

13:09.862 --> 13:11.172
Don't be nervous.
You love us.

13:14.655 --> 13:17.275
What did they offer you?
What are you doing?

13:20.172 --> 13:22.103
Dude, like, prison's no joke.

13:22.172 --> 13:25.241
Like, "Orange is the New Black."
I saw that , it's scary.

13:25.310 --> 13:26.517
I don't want him going to jail.

13:26.586 --> 13:28.172
He is literally
not gonna survive.

13:28.241 --> 13:30.448
It's .
I'm just very concerned.

13:30.517 --> 13:34.551
What is worst case scenario
for you if you're found guilty?

13:37.517 --> 13:41.241
What?
Five

13:48.103 --> 13:51.896
♪ I got a clique
full of drug dealers ♪

13:51.965 --> 13:54.655
You have to sum up Miami
for me with single Ronnie.

13:54.724 --> 13:56.275
Bro, I was out of control.I like single Ronnie.

13:56.344 --> 13:58.896
Everyone likes
single Ronnie.
I like Miami.

13:58.965 --> 14:00.862
Me and Ronnie both
live in Las Vegas.

14:00.931 --> 14:03.310
But I don't see Ronnie
too much because I'm busy

14:03.379 --> 14:05.379
doing my work DJing
all over the world.

14:05.448 --> 14:07.896
So I'm happy to get together.

14:07.965 --> 14:09.965
Now everybody's in
a different place in their life

14:10.034 --> 14:11.379
and we're coming back together.
It's gonna be dope.

14:11.448 --> 14:12.931
Who's got kids?
Who got married?

14:13.000 --> 14:14.206
Mike's all different now.

14:14.275 --> 14:15.448
I don't know what Mike's
gonna do. I feel like...

14:15.517 --> 14:16.620
Mike's two years sober now.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.275
I feel like
he's plotting something.

14:18.344 --> 14:20.379
You don't trust him
'cause he's too nice.Yeah, too nice.

14:20.448 --> 14:21.655
I don't know what's
gonna go on with Mike.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.275
We had so much friction
for so many years.

14:24.344 --> 14:25.827
And now,
it's like this new Mike.

14:25.896 --> 14:28.068
I hope he stays sober,
I'm not gonna lie.

14:28.137 --> 14:29.586
But I kinda want to see him
be a dick

14:29.655 --> 14:30.758
to someone else besides me.

14:30.827 --> 14:32.310
And then Sammi.

14:32.379 --> 14:34.137
What, Sammi's not gonna come.
Why wouldn't Sammi come?

14:34.206 --> 14:35.448
Yeah, I-- I don't know.

14:35.517 --> 14:38.137
I think, I'm like--
I'm still confused about it.

14:38.206 --> 14:39.655
Is she dating somebody?
What's her deal?I mean, yeah.

14:39.724 --> 14:41.448
She's with this kid
for what, eight months?

14:41.517 --> 14:43.000
All I know is that
he popped up on Instagram,

14:43.068 --> 14:45.241
looks exactly like you.
I'm like, what the...

14:46.931 --> 14:48.068
He does look like me, huh?

14:48.137 --> 14:49.517
He does.
A little bit.

14:49.586 --> 14:51.034
So once we left
the shore house,

14:51.103 --> 14:52.758
me and Sam decided
we're gonna take the next step

14:52.827 --> 14:54.344
and we moved in
with each other.

14:54.413 --> 14:56.206
'Cause we were getting towards
that stage where it was like

14:56.275 --> 14:57.965
I either have to
or get off the pot.

14:58.034 --> 14:59.241
She gave me a timeline.

14:59.310 --> 15:01.068
She's like, "I wanna get
married in six months."

15:01.137 --> 15:03.586
And like, I'm still trying
to figure my life out.Holy .

15:03.655 --> 15:05.068
I got cold feet, you know?

15:05.137 --> 15:06.344
I wanted to do the right thing,

15:06.413 --> 15:07.793
but there was a part of me
that was like,

15:07.862 --> 15:09.172
I'm not gonna do
the right thing.
So I didn't do it.

15:09.241 --> 15:11.517
I ended up cheating.
She found out.

15:11.586 --> 15:13.172
I blew it, it's over.

15:13.241 --> 15:15.758
So is there anything
that you could say to her,

15:15.827 --> 15:17.241
or maybe I could say to her,
to get her to come?

15:17.310 --> 15:19.344
There's probably
one thing we could say.

15:19.413 --> 15:20.655
What?

15:20.724 --> 15:22.448
Now I have a baby on the way.

15:22.517 --> 15:25.137
You what?!
What?

15:25.206 --> 15:26.862
Yeah, I'm having a kid, bro.

15:26.931 --> 15:28.241
Get the  outta here.

15:28.310 --> 15:29.517
What the ?

15:29.586 --> 15:31.413
How could you have
a child with somebody

15:31.482 --> 15:32.689
that I haven't even met yet?

15:32.758 --> 15:34.689
Holy ,
you're gonna be a dad.

15:34.758 --> 15:36.137
I am.
Just like you.

15:36.206 --> 15:38.517
Wow.
Who knows?

15:38.586 --> 15:40.206
Um, I haven't told
anyone yet.

15:40.275 --> 15:41.724
Wow, congratulations.

15:41.793 --> 15:44.241
Not the most ideal situation,
but what is?

15:44.310 --> 15:45.827
Regardless of whether
you marry this girl,

15:45.896 --> 15:47.206
whether you stay
with this girl,

15:47.275 --> 15:48.448
you need to take care
of your child.

15:48.517 --> 15:50.275
You're with
that child for life.
Yeah.

15:50.344 --> 15:52.517
I'm not with the baby mother,
but I'm with my daughter
for life.

15:52.586 --> 15:53.862
And that's my whole life.

15:53.931 --> 15:55.344
I'll always be
a  husband,

15:55.413 --> 15:57.586
boyfriend, but I'll
never be a  father.

15:57.655 --> 15:58.965
Exactly.

15:59.034 --> 16:00.310
I mean, this is
grown man .

16:00.379 --> 16:02.344
