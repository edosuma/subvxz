00:01.752 --> 00:03.288
<i>Previously on Wynonna Earp...</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:05.124
Why'd you even come back,
Wynonna?

00:05.297 --> 00:07.254
Haven't the people who love you
suffered enough?

00:07.424 --> 00:08.864
You said they can't
attack the house!

00:08.926 --> 00:10.766
They figured out how
to get around the bedrock!

00:11.887 --> 00:13.003
Hey, sis!

00:13.180 --> 00:14.741
Starting again, isn't it?
We need that gun!

00:14.765 --> 00:17.929
Wyatt Earp christened it
'Peacemaker'.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.704
Something awful is happening
in Purgatory,

00:19.728 --> 00:21.685
and it has everything
to do with my last name!

00:21.855 --> 00:22.855
Deputy Marshal Dolls.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.561
- We monitor specific activity.
- What kind of activity?

00:25.734 --> 00:28.101
Demons. They can blend in.
They look just like us.

00:28.278 --> 00:31.021
Welcome to
the Black Badge Division.

00:33.000 --> 00:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.645 --> 01:03.432
Like it or not, you are now

01:03.605 --> 01:06.393
consultant deputy
for the Black Badge Division.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.524
You need to be smart, discreet,

01:08.694 --> 01:11.027
especially when
you're hunting demons.

01:11.196 --> 01:14.985
Revenants. Wyatt Earp's kills,
Daddy called them 'revenants'.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.151
Are you sure this is one of 'em?

01:21.665 --> 01:23.247
Yeah.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.204
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25.377 --> 01:27.744
OK? Government issue.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.460
And a lot more accurate.

01:32.509 --> 01:35.297
- Jesus Christ.
- Oops! Sorry.

01:35.470 --> 01:37.712
Fancy but powerless.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.243
Pretty sure only 'Peacemaker'
can send revheads back to Hades.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.259
- You don't know that for a fact.
- Wanna bet?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.974
- Loser buys dinner?
- No. You lose, you die.

01:45.147 --> 01:47.639
OK? Besides, I don't gamble.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.773
You're sending in
your best agent...

01:49.943 --> 01:51.024
My only agent.

01:51.194 --> 01:52.901
With the wrong gun that...

01:53.071 --> 01:54.903
Now, that sounds like
a gamble to me.

01:55.073 --> 01:56.689
- Good luck.
- You're not coming?

01:56.867 --> 01:59.701
Consider this your first solo mission.
Don't blow it.

01:59.870 --> 02:02.487
I never blow jobs
without a 'please' first.

02:04.166 --> 02:06.783
That joke kills
with the Hell's Angels.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.292
There's something wrong
with you.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.125
- Conceal your weapon!
- Shit! Yes, OK.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.386
Damn Earps!

02:18.555 --> 02:22.595
Always interrupting
my good time.

02:29.107 --> 02:32.521
Special deputy!
Cross-border task...

02:33.654 --> 02:35.691
Crazy chick with a gun!

02:43.622 --> 02:45.614
Hey, this ain't Wyatt's gun!

02:45.791 --> 02:48.204
Ugly and dumb.
You sure we haven't dated?

02:48.377 --> 02:50.289
Ugh!

02:55.634 --> 02:56.795
Ugh!

02:56.968 --> 02:59.631
Bad revenant! Stay.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.393
Yep.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.899
She better be dead.

03:16.113 --> 03:18.321
This is for what you did
to my family.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.407
Earp, no!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.369
What happened to discreet, huh?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.828
Discreet went out the window

03:30.001 --> 03:31.521
when Red started snacking
on lady fingers.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.787
Shit! Go, get him!

03:38.969 --> 03:42.053
- Great, we lost him.
- Well, YOU lost him!

03:42.222 --> 03:44.134
Black Badge is about
flying under the radar.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.424
You flew over the radar
in a flaming, pink jet.

03:46.601 --> 03:48.342
You made a spectacle
of yourself, Deputy.

03:48.520 --> 03:49.520
- Pink?
- Yeah, pink!

03:49.604 --> 03:51.721
How dare you!

03:51.898 --> 03:54.356
And YOU owe me dinner.

03:54.526 --> 03:57.940
Seriously, I won the bet, so...

03:58.113 --> 04:00.821
I'll settle for tacos.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.221
Ow! Dammit!

04:26.475 --> 04:28.888
What is the target?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.645
Very well.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.227
You are it.

05:05.138 --> 05:10.133
Well, I seem to have settled
amongst a commune of artistes.

05:16.191 --> 05:17.648
How are those
bullet holes healing?

05:17.818 --> 05:19.730
Better than your face.

05:19.903 --> 05:22.270
Not to worry, gents,
the new heir

05:22.447 --> 05:25.736
is sporting tits,
a rabid case of nymphomania,

05:25.909 --> 05:27.275
and the wrong gun.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.613
She's got 'Peacemaker'.

05:28.787 --> 05:31.120
How long we gotta wait
till Boss has her taken out?

05:31.289 --> 05:33.576
I do beg your pardon,

05:33.750 --> 05:37.460
but you gentlemen seem to be
having the most delightful game

05:37.629 --> 05:38.961
of five-card brag,

05:39.130 --> 05:41.247
and I would surely love
to buy in.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.756
It's called Texas hold 'em.

05:42.926 --> 05:45.088
Rules have changed a lot
since your day.

05:45.262 --> 05:46.844
Oh, I reckon I'd pick it up.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.379
You ain't picking up shit.

05:48.557 --> 05:52.141
We know who you are...
and who you rode alongside of.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.893
Then what better opportunity
to make me pay

05:55.063 --> 05:57.271
for my poor choices in friends

05:57.440 --> 06:00.399
than by taking
all of my earnings?

06:01.903 --> 06:04.065
Alright.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.777
Despite our trip
to the big city,

06:11.955 --> 06:14.368
Wyatt's revenants seem to be
concentrated here in Purgatory,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.373
so this will be
our battleground.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.343
I'm telling you,
none of these are gonna work.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.124
The Black Badge was
a top-secret branch of the Marshals

06:21.298 --> 06:24.507
founded in the 1900s
by Roosevelt...

06:24.676 --> 06:26.338
- Eleanor?
- Teddy.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.298
To eradicate
the paranormal forces

06:28.471 --> 06:31.054
suddenly blossoming
on North American soil...

06:31.224 --> 06:32.556
Do you have a flamethrower?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.206
'Cause a flamethrower
is at least fun.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.512
Working with your grandfather,
actually, Edwin Earp,

06:36.563 --> 06:38.099
to handle things up here.

06:38.273 --> 06:39.605
Hmm... yeah.

06:39.774 --> 06:41.766
A one-year wonder.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.559
Family legend has it Eddie was

06:43.737 --> 06:45.524
only the heir
for, like, 11 months,

06:45.697 --> 06:48.155
but came real close to sending
all 77 of Wyatt's kills...

06:48.325 --> 06:51.693
back to hell.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.954
77, huh? That's how many outlaws
we'll have to put down?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.659
Yeah, give or take a 7.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.165
So, what about your dad?

06:58.335 --> 07:01.954
- How many revenants did he...
- Not enough.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.792
Ah.

07:03.965 --> 07:06.127
Well, now they're gonna
have to deal with you,

07:06.301 --> 07:07.633
right after you deal with

07:07.802 --> 07:09.464
the shit-ton of paperwork
you generated

07:09.638 --> 07:11.158
after last night's
disastrous takedown.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.598
OK, like, one blonde
broke a heel,

07:14.768 --> 07:18.387
and I was trying
to smoke the revenant.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.555
Ohh!

07:20.732 --> 07:22.018
Our number one priority is

07:22.192 --> 07:24.184
to keep the public
from learning they exist.

07:24.361 --> 07:26.401
People here deserve to know
what they're up against,

07:26.446 --> 07:28.859
even if most of these people
are dicks who hate me.

07:29.032 --> 07:31.740
If the public know
that demons are out there...

07:31.910 --> 07:33.276
widespread panic.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.410
OK. Have a little faith.

07:35.580 --> 07:37.572
We've survived
hotdog-stuffed-crust pizza,

07:37.749 --> 07:39.741
so I think we got this.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.001
- What is that?
- Maldito, New Mexico.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.456
The last town to realise

07:43.630 --> 07:45.872
they were under siege
from hell spawn.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.253
It's a crater.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.962
That's all that's left

07:50.136 --> 07:52.844
after they dispatched
the Tomahawk missiles.

07:53.014 --> 07:56.132
- To beat the bad guys?
- To contain the story.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.722
You want this to happen
to Purgatory?

08:00.355 --> 08:02.893
Normal dudes carry baby pictures
in their wallet.

08:03.066 --> 08:05.183
Normal's in the past, Deputy.
You're Black Badge now.

08:08.113 --> 08:10.355
Whoo!

08:10.532 --> 08:12.319
Love you!

08:13.493 --> 08:15.485
Alright, Mr Know-It-All,

08:15.662 --> 08:17.949
tell me what my sister sees
in that D-bag.

08:18.123 --> 08:20.331
I couldn't tell you.
I don't do relationships.

08:20.500 --> 08:23.618
How about smiling?
You ever do that? Hmm?

08:34.222 --> 08:36.760
See, but it wasn't
the whore's burgundy corset

08:36.933 --> 08:38.344
that gave me pause, gentlemen,

08:38.518 --> 08:40.100
nor was it the healthy merkin

08:40.270 --> 08:43.308
perched between
that sweet dove's legs.

08:43.481 --> 08:47.521
No, it was that she had a tail.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.811
An honest-to-goodness tail

08:49.988 --> 08:52.856
as perky as
a pretty puppy dog's.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.776
But it wasn't wagging,
so I was game.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.123
Why, Levi. Back for more?

09:03.293 --> 09:05.455
I've been keeping your stake
warm for ya.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.585
Boss man wants to see you.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.875
Well, it is about time.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.716
Gentlemen.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.677
Ugh!

09:20.935 --> 09:23.518
You really are a hard fella
to get a hold of.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.600
But it's good to know
that once I have

09:25.774 --> 09:27.265
your attention,
I really, really...

09:27.442 --> 09:28.978
Ahh! Godammit!

09:29.152 --> 09:31.144
Stay.

09:31.321 --> 09:34.234
I thought we had
an understanding, Hank.

09:34.407 --> 09:37.866
You were to keep
to the outskirts of my park.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.119
Well, I like attention.

09:40.288 --> 09:42.496
- I always have.
- When you were a man?

09:42.665 --> 09:46.659
I still am a man
with a very specific skill set,

09:46.836 --> 09:49.078
one I seek to exploit
to financial gain

09:49.255 --> 09:51.838
with a man such as yourself.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.802
You ain't one of us.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.677
But I could be.

10:04.854 --> 10:08.894
You know, better you and yours
who follow the old codes

10:09.067 --> 10:12.231
than these modern-day people
who follow none.

10:12.403 --> 10:13.439
And the Earps?

10:13.613 --> 10:15.354
It is just a matter of time

10:15.532 --> 10:19.367
before they figure out
who I really am and what I did

10:19.536 --> 10:23.155
to their great-great-granddaddy.

10:23.331 --> 10:25.197
Alright, I'll ante up.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.459
Now, you fetch me
something of theirs,

10:28.628 --> 10:31.792
something that lets me know
what they're up to,

10:31.965 --> 10:34.958
and I'll give you
what you really want.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.176
And what is that?

10:38.346 --> 10:39.962
Revenge.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.178
You sure that's OK, Gus?

10:48.356 --> 10:50.769
- You were just in the hospital.
- It's medicinal.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.356
No weapons at the table.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.862
"Medicinal" - nice.

10:57.031 --> 10:58.317
- Ah!
- Oh!

10:58.491 --> 10:59.607
- Hey.
- Hey...

10:59.784 --> 11:04.074
Frida Kahlo, look what I found
at the homestead.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.830
Aw! No way!

11:07.000 --> 11:09.743
Aw, I loved colouring.

11:09.919 --> 11:12.832
Hey, look, here's one
of Mom, Dad, and Willa.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.589
- Who's this nut sack?
- Language, Wynonna.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.420
My imaginary friend.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.711
You adorable psycho.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.800
What was his name again?
Bongo? Bill? Bilbo?

11:21.973 --> 11:25.057
Where's my head?
I forgot the carrots.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.512
The revenants who took you,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.268
recognise 'em
from your research?

11:28.438 --> 11:31.101
Hmm, no. Well, I was kind of
busy trying to breathe.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.391
Hey, but, listen,
if I joined Black Badge,

11:33.568 --> 11:35.525
I could bring my research.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.278
- And my amazing banana muffins.
- No!

11:38.448 --> 11:40.888
Did you see the bruises on my back
from last night's clubbing?

11:41.034 --> 11:42.741
- Dude, I didn't even tequila.
- Yeah.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.699
- But you shot the guy, right?
- But I didn't put him down.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.784
Oh...

11:47.957 --> 11:50.665
Yeah, yeah, you think?

11:53.254 --> 11:56.372
Tell me where 'Peacemaker' is,
and I'll kill your sister fast.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.211
It's in my panty drawer.

11:58.384 --> 12:00.671
Why don't we go get it?

12:00.845 --> 12:03.258
Get away from my girls,
you nut sack!

12:03.431 --> 12:04.763
Hey, you stay out of this, Gus!

12:04.933 --> 12:07.050
Like hell I will.
Wynonna, get the gun!

12:07.227 --> 12:08.843
Wh-what?! What gun?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.307
Where gun?

12:19.697 --> 12:22.531
Boss man said
I'd never take it from you.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.738
Can't wait to prove him wrong.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.617
No!

12:32.794 --> 12:35.332
Get it off!

12:35.505 --> 12:38.623
Arggh! It burns!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.884
Arggh!

12:48.851 --> 12:51.138
Red?

12:51.312 --> 12:53.304
Red?

12:57.527 --> 12:59.359
Oh...

12:59.529 --> 13:01.145
We're gonna get you.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.689
'We'? Maybe.

13:03.866 --> 13:06.654
'You'? Doesn't look great.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.157
Hyah!

13:23.886 --> 13:28.096
- Clean-up, Aisle 3.
- I'll get a cloth.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.526
Yah! Jesus!

13:41.696 --> 13:44.154
Jesus! Ugh!

13:44.324 --> 13:45.610
Perfect.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.150
I didn't know Shorty's had
wet T-shirt competitions.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.615
- You OK?
- Yeah. Yeah.

13:50.788 --> 13:53.155
I, uh... Just a bit jumpy.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.996
Had a... a CRAZY night.

13:56.169 --> 13:59.207
Sorry I wasn't here to see it.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.838
I've been, uh... I've been meaning
to introduce myself.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.374
I'm Nicole.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.551
- Nicole Haught.
- Hi.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.886
- And you are Waverly Earp.
- Yes.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.592
Quite a popular girl
around here.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.509
- It's all in the smile and wave.
- Yeah.

14:12.685 --> 14:14.597
Can I get a cappuccino to go?

14:14.771 --> 14:16.353
Oh, I'm... I'm really sorry.

14:16.522 --> 14:18.354
Um, we're not actually open yet.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.436
- So...
- Oh! Right!

14:20.610 --> 14:21.942
Again, my bad.

14:22.111 --> 14:25.900
It's just when I see something I like,
I don't wanna wait.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.781
And your door was open, so...

14:27.950 --> 14:29.782
Right.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.069
Oh, God, I'm sopping wet.

14:32.246 --> 14:35.830
You know, I keep telling Shorty
he needs to fix the darn taps.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.457
Sorry, do you mind just, uh...?

14:37.627 --> 14:39.209
- Oh!
- I'm gonna...

14:39.379 --> 14:40.790
So...

14:48.262 --> 14:49.753
Oh!

14:49.931 --> 14:51.547
Oh, crap! Um...

14:51.724 --> 14:53.511
Uh... Uh, officer?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.596
- I'm stuck, so...
- Oh!

14:55.770 --> 14:57.386
- Please...
- Yeah. Let me help you.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.475
I got you.

14:59.649 --> 15:02.062
Oh, God! Good job
you're not some guy, right?

15:02.235 --> 15:05.273
Or this would be
really, really awkward.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.110
Um...

15:09.283 --> 15:11.240
I-I owe you one.

15:11.411 --> 15:13.698
Alright, well, how about
you buy me that cup of coffee?

15:13.871 --> 15:15.828
- How about tonight?
- Oh, I can't.

15:15.998 --> 15:16.998
- No?
- No.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.499
I mean, I'd love to, but...
like... like to, uh...

15:19.669 --> 15:21.160
but I have plans.

15:21.337 --> 15:23.499
Yeah. I'm a planner.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.460
I like to know
what I'm doing at least

15:25.633 --> 15:28.467
two or three days in advance.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.922
Um...

15:30.096 --> 15:32.713
I'm in a relationship.
With a boy... man!

15:32.890 --> 15:35.223
A boy-man?

15:35.393 --> 15:38.477
Yep, I've been there.

15:38.646 --> 15:40.979
It's the worst.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.766
OK, well, some other time.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.562
I mean it.

15:55.329 --> 15:57.992
"Officer Haught."

15:59.709 --> 16:01.541
Of course.

16:05.631 --> 16:06.997
'Classified', my ass.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.655
These are
Purgatory Sheriff's Offices.

16:08.718 --> 16:10.050
You can't just commandeer 'em.

16:10.219 --> 16:11.710
Fine, I'll let you
share the kitchen.

16:11.888 --> 16:13.220
Let me?!

16:13.389 --> 16:15.096
Look, our funds have been
slashed in half,

16:15.266 --> 16:17.508
I've got one rookie officer
on the roster.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.221
I even buy the coffee myself!

16:19.395 --> 16:21.557
Look, I'm running
a cross-border task force,

16:21.731 --> 16:23.063
working on a joint investigation

16:23.232 --> 16:25.064
into a sophisticated
criminal syndicate,

16:25.234 --> 16:26.645
a syndicate that
is wreaking havoc

16:26.819 --> 16:28.230
under your do-nothing nose,
Sheriff.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.942
And you're worried about me
poaching your French roast?

16:31.115 --> 16:33.277
I called Washington
and I called Ottawa.

16:33.451 --> 16:34.908
Nobody's even heard
of your division!

16:35.077 --> 16:36.517
It's like the whole thing
has been...

16:36.621 --> 16:37.907
Classified?

16:38.080 --> 16:39.680
Consider yourself
on a need-to-know basis

16:39.749 --> 16:41.081
from this point forward, Nedley.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.788
And all you need to know is
that I've checked your fridge...

16:43.961 --> 16:45.953
and your cream's expired.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.544
We take cash.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.132
Or credit card or CASH.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.986
Or personal cheque
or certified cheque or -

16:57.016 --> 16:59.224
stop me if I'm repeating myself -
CASH.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.306
We do not take pirate booty
or whatever these are.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.311
OK.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.268
Don't worry, Shorty, I got this.

17:05.441 --> 17:06.727
I know him.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.233
Keep telling her, you don't
have to be nice to everybody.

17:09.403 --> 17:14.022
Oh, I appreciate the sentiment,
but I'm not sure I do know you.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.863
And I would remember
a face like yours.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.699
OK. Hi, I'm Waverly.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.752
And don't do that,
I have a big, burly boyfriend

17:21.874 --> 17:24.116
who can bring a calf to its knees
in eight seconds flat.

17:24.292 --> 17:28.002
Oh, my! He sounds
positively harrowing.

17:28.172 --> 17:30.505
I know what you're here for.

17:30.675 --> 17:31.961
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.296
I can spot you groupies
a mile away.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.883
You know, the fake
old West get-up,

17:37.056 --> 17:38.388
the awe-struck reverence

17:38.558 --> 17:40.925
while you gaze
upon his saddlebags...

17:41.102 --> 17:42.434
I mean, I totally get it, right?

17:42.603 --> 17:44.435
You wanna keep his memory alive.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.972
You wanna drink
where Wyatt Earp drank.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.856
Wyatt didn't drink.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.733
He preferred ice-cream.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.360
Uh, well, who doesn't?

17:52.530 --> 17:53.987
Right?

17:54.156 --> 17:55.818
I'm an Earp. I-I m... I mean...

17:55.992 --> 17:58.530
I mean, 'Earper'.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.865
I'm an 'Earper' too. Yeah.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.405
Found most of this stuff myself.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.041
Don't you try to go up
against me on eBay now.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.748
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

18:10.172 --> 18:11.692
You know, I've got
Wyatt's original holster

18:11.716 --> 18:13.002
up in my apartment.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.791
Yeah.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.803
Oh, which I'm definitely not
inviting you up to, by the way.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.509
You are SO not my type.

18:20.683 --> 18:22.515
Darlin', I'm everybody's type.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.551
So you sleep here too?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.595
It's a shame
a pretty thing like you

18:26.772 --> 18:28.138
never gets to leave the saloon.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.148
Uh... you know what?

18:31.402 --> 18:33.064
There.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.944
Covered you out of my tips.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.776
- I did not ask you to.
- No.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.941
Didn't need to.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.657
I got a good feeling about you.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.117
And I'm an excellent
judge of character.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.331
Sweetheart...

18:50.504 --> 18:52.336
you really aren't.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.623
Only 'Peacemaker'
puts 'em down for good.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.588
Long as I hit 'em
between the eyes. Oh!

18:57.762 --> 18:59.197
And revenants can't
physically hold it.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.464
Not without vibrating
faster than a... You know.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.134
I have my toys, you have yours.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.600
Anyway, regular guns can
slow the revheads down,

19:08.773 --> 19:10.810
but they will always
come back for more

19:10.983 --> 19:13.521
until they meet 'Peacemaker',
which only I can handle...

19:13.694 --> 19:15.526
Yep, in theory.

19:15.696 --> 19:17.779
Look, I've been attacked
four times

19:17.948 --> 19:19.940
in the last three days, OK?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.983
The homestead, Shorty's.
I'm a...

19:22.161 --> 19:25.279
I need a safe place
to regroup and sleep.

19:25.456 --> 19:27.914
As long as you don't leave town.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.000
Hey! Check it out.

19:31.170 --> 19:34.959
Another piping-hot
delivery from...

19:35.132 --> 19:36.919
wow, CSIS.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.756
Oh, I'm Nicole. Officer Haught.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.171
Y'all getting settled in
alright? What is all this stuff?

19:42.348 --> 19:44.260
Nice to meet you,
Officer Haught.

19:44.433 --> 19:47.426
If you ever enter my offices
again without knocking,

19:47.603 --> 19:49.560
I'm gonna have you
arrested for treason.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.346
OK?

19:51.524 --> 19:53.857
Nice to meet you too.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.438
She did knock, Dolls.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.510
You sure you don't wanna
threaten her with death?

20:01.534 --> 20:03.901
Penalty for treason is death.

20:04.078 --> 20:06.536
It was implied.

20:07.873 --> 20:09.455
I know.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.410
Red tried to get
a hold of 'Peacemaker'.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.580
It fried him
from the inside out!

20:16.757 --> 20:19.625
Then Earp picked it up
and... and... and Red...

20:19.802 --> 20:21.794
Caught a one-way ticket
down south, right?

20:21.971 --> 20:24.258
Let me see
if I got this straight.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.469
Malcolm kills her uncle,

20:26.642 --> 20:29.601
lures the heir back home,
and now this?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.136
How many times I gotta tell you?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.225
'Peacemaker' can't be touched
by revenant hand.

20:33.399 --> 20:34.765
- But we just thought...
- Don't!

20:34.942 --> 20:38.606
Ever! Think!

20:39.613 --> 20:42.401
I do the thinking...
for all of us.

20:42.575 --> 20:46.114
You hear me? Now, you wanna
get outta here, Levi?

20:46.287 --> 20:47.653
You wanna escape the Triangle,

20:47.830 --> 20:49.492
feast on everything
and everyone?

20:49.665 --> 20:52.203
Hell, yes.
Boss, it's all I want.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.038
That's good.

20:54.211 --> 20:58.376
So what we do is
we create a distraction.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.461
We bring in professional help.

21:00.634 --> 21:03.843
If we wanna hire... HIM...

21:04.013 --> 21:07.472
we need a mortal's blood,
willingly given.

21:07.641 --> 21:10.475
None of our human familiars
will risk it!

21:10.644 --> 21:12.931
So we need a sucker.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.687
OK.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.395
Why, I just happen
to have one...

21:17.568 --> 21:20.276
and he's mighty keen
to impress me.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.739
Now, what does one get

21:24.909 --> 21:29.199
for the demonic sociopath
that has everything?

21:29.371 --> 21:32.990
A braver man
would suggest mouthwash.

21:33.167 --> 21:34.999
Why, hello.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.218
"Barney Riggs, Henry Starr,
Cole Younger..."

21:49.391 --> 21:51.724
She's got the who's who
of outlaws in here.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.143
Lord Almighty!

22:01.362 --> 22:02.944
Whoever you are,

22:03.113 --> 22:04.900
you're robbing
my sister's place,

22:05.074 --> 22:06.986
and that's a bad move, revenant.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.821
Oh! Sonofabitch!

22:12.748 --> 22:15.240
Crap!

22:17.628 --> 22:19.585
So he was fast.

22:23.968 --> 22:26.255
I love what you've done
with the place.

22:26.428 --> 22:27.760
Another rendezvous so soon?

22:27.930 --> 22:29.546
I suppose I should be flattered.

22:29.723 --> 22:33.091
Now, did you bring me
something of the Earps?

22:34.603 --> 22:37.220
I'm working on it.

22:37.398 --> 22:38.730
'Cause you're gonna
enlist someone

22:38.899 --> 22:40.561
who's gonna take care
of the heir.

22:40.734 --> 22:43.317
And once she's dead,
you're gonna bring me her gun.

22:43.487 --> 22:45.069
Unless you got
a problem with that?

22:46.532 --> 22:51.152
The only one about to have
a problem is Wynonna.

22:51.328 --> 22:55.038
Now, what exactly
does this entail?

22:56.876 --> 23:00.586
What is this revenant's
raison d'être?

23:00.754 --> 23:04.043
- Do I know him?
- His name's Jim Miller.

23:04.216 --> 23:07.334
Killed his grandparents,
brother-in-law,

23:07.511 --> 23:09.173
then anyone he was paid to.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.008
Called him Killer Miller.

23:11.181 --> 23:12.922
I remember.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.717
Rumour has it was Miller,
not Robert Ford,

23:15.895 --> 23:17.511
who put down Jesse James.

23:17.688 --> 23:21.682
Well, Robert Ford
was an awful shot.

23:21.859 --> 23:25.478
It was always said
Miller moved like a shadow.

23:25.654 --> 23:27.486
Now he is one.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.272
Shadow assassin

23:29.450 --> 23:33.239
who can only be activated
by a blood sacrifice.

23:33.412 --> 23:37.656
You outlaws sure have gotten dramatic
since you were human.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.997
The shadow's as far from human
as it gets.

23:41.170 --> 23:45.631
No, the real question is,
what the hell are you?

23:45.799 --> 23:47.665
Still me. Don't be jealous.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.550
Not jealous. I'm disgusted.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.336
You were Wyatt Earp's
right hand.

23:51.513 --> 23:54.176
What would he say if he knew
you were joining forces

23:54.350 --> 23:56.012
with every man he ever put down?

23:56.185 --> 23:58.723
The dead don't get a vote.

23:58.896 --> 24:02.230
Now, are we doing this or what?

24:03.275 --> 24:05.483
Hey, I got all 34 of your texts.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.110
Your apartment's
been broken into.

24:07.279 --> 24:09.020
- You can't go back.
- Oh, what?!

24:09.198 --> 24:11.158
- But my yoga mat is there.
- Well, it's not safe.

24:11.325 --> 24:16.036
And neither is Gus's or Shorty's
or the back of Champ's pick-up.

24:16.205 --> 24:18.037
Ew!

24:18.207 --> 24:20.620
This place used to be.

24:20.793 --> 24:22.625
Remember when Mama
made these wind chimes?

24:22.795 --> 24:25.412
Do you remember?
This was a home then.

24:25.589 --> 24:29.674
You know? Never saw anything
scarier than an albino gopher.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.381
Until the attack
where half of us died.

24:32.554 --> 24:33.920
Oh, hey, Marshal Dolls!

24:34.098 --> 24:36.379
How old were you when the revenants
invaded the homestead?

24:36.517 --> 24:37.883
- 12.
- 6.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.972
And they'd never done it before?

24:40.145 --> 24:42.137
Maybe they were scared
of our dad.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.522
Or physically unable
to step foot on Earp land.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.775
- Hey, that's...
- Ammonite.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.310
This mineral found around here?

24:48.487 --> 24:50.298
Unless you can smoke it,
I really wouldn't know.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.358
You want a safe place?

24:51.532 --> 24:53.212
This stuff might explain
why your ancestors

24:53.283 --> 24:54.615
built this house here.

24:54.785 --> 24:56.221
A house that doesn't have
running water

24:56.245 --> 24:57.736
and smells like skunk hiney?

24:59.206 --> 25:02.165
Yeah, I'll... I'll be in my car.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.671
It's tough for her...
being the youngest.

25:07.840 --> 25:08.671
Yeah.

25:08.841 --> 25:12.881
She was four when Mama left.
She just up and moved away.

25:13.053 --> 25:14.965
Maybe it runs in the family.

25:15.139 --> 25:18.849
Anyways, you got a good look
at the thief at Waverly's?

25:19.018 --> 25:20.259
Better yet, a shot?

25:20.436 --> 25:23.019
Yeah, I did, but he was better.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.180
Better than what?

25:25.357 --> 25:27.974
You two look around
the homestead.

25:28.152 --> 25:30.018
See if you see
anything unfamiliar,

25:30.195 --> 25:31.857
something occult-ish.

25:32.031 --> 25:34.114
Occult...?

25:34.283 --> 25:36.240
That is so specifically vague.

25:36.410 --> 25:37.742
You want a safe place

25:37.911 --> 25:40.073
to lay your head
for you and your sister?

25:40.247 --> 25:42.580
- Keep your eyes open, Earp.
- For trouble?

25:42.750 --> 25:44.958
That too.

25:55.637 --> 25:59.756
You really think Jim Miller
could dispatch the heir?

25:59.933 --> 26:02.676
I've seen Ms Earp
at work up close.

26:02.853 --> 26:05.186
She is quick. And tough too.

26:05.355 --> 26:07.563
She might surprise you.

26:07.733 --> 26:11.568
The shadow's real particular
on payment - mortal blood.

26:11.737 --> 26:14.855
You say you're still human...

26:19.036 --> 26:20.868
Hold this.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.872
Looks like it's my turn
to befoul...

26:25.709 --> 26:28.326
someone else's abode.

26:36.595 --> 26:40.009
DEEP, GROWLING VOICE:
What is the target?

26:40.182 --> 26:41.673
No! I can't!

26:41.850 --> 26:44.467
- I won't go back in the dark!
- Give Miller his orders!

26:44.645 --> 26:47.979
Toss in something of the heir
so he knows who the real target is!

26:48.148 --> 26:51.232
You could not have acquainted me
with those particulars earlier?

26:51.401 --> 26:54.360
I have nothing on my person
that belongs to Wynonna Earp!

27:08.877 --> 27:10.834
She will be mine.

27:12.840 --> 27:16.208
What... was that?

27:16.385 --> 27:20.220
He who moves amongst the shadows
and delivers us the darkness.

27:20.389 --> 27:22.847
The bitch heir
will never survive.

27:23.016 --> 27:24.973
Lord knows her daddy didn't.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.269
Except that wasn't.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.772
I tossed Miller something
that belonged to Wynonna's sister.

27:32.943 --> 27:36.311
His mark is Waverly.

27:36.488 --> 27:39.401
That sweet little thing?

27:39.575 --> 27:42.659
You must really hate the Earps.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.454
OK, so what exactly
are we looking for?

27:50.627 --> 27:53.290
Something strange
and hard to explain.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.125
Like your relationship
with Champ.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.258
Pfft! You're hardly qualified
to give relationship advice.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.511
Remember that guy with
the satanic face tattoo?

28:01.680 --> 28:03.967
What? Phil really loved
Norwegian death metal.

28:04.141 --> 28:06.849
- Oh, sure.
- Look, Waverly...

28:08.687 --> 28:11.225
"Willa, age 10."

28:11.398 --> 28:12.764
"Wynonna, age 7."

28:12.941 --> 28:14.477
I was... Mmm...

28:14.651 --> 28:16.608
I'm not on there, am I?

28:16.778 --> 28:20.442
- Probably rubbed off.
- Yeah.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.573
It's what I used to tell myself.

28:36.423 --> 28:37.914
- Yeah?
- It's not ammonite.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.424
- It's ammolite.
- Pfft! Amateur mistake.

28:40.594 --> 28:43.177
Prized by the Blackfoot
for its ability to ward off evil,

28:43.347 --> 28:45.158
which it probably did
when you were growing up.

28:45.182 --> 28:46.514
So I looked at the survey,

28:46.683 --> 28:49.141
and the homestead's built
on a bedrock of this stuff.

28:49.311 --> 28:50.722
Whoa, Dolls, slow down.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.856
Remember that occult
something I told you to find?

28:53.023 --> 28:54.810
It's a talisman
made from vertebrae

28:54.983 --> 28:56.565
and bound by iron twine.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.227
Ew!
We haven't found anything like that.

28:59.404 --> 29:01.685
It'll be in the ground.
Buried to counteract the ammolite.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.865
Dolls, the homestead's 10 acres.

29:04.034 --> 29:06.822
We can't dig for it
all ni... night.

29:08.789 --> 29:11.031
Seems to have fallen
awful early.

29:12.334 --> 29:13.791
- It's dark out there?
- Yeah.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.452
The sky's gone all weird.

29:15.629 --> 29:17.336
- Same at the cop shop?
- No.

29:17.506 --> 29:20.749
- Eclipse? Storm?
- Revenant?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.292
Just stay near a light source.

29:22.469 --> 29:24.335
- Why? What's coming?
- Me.

29:24.513 --> 29:26.073
I'm 30 minutes out.
I'll be there, Earp.

29:28.934 --> 29:32.928
God! I swear, I can't
get this flashlight lit!

29:33.105 --> 29:36.473
Hey, what do you say to
a good old-fashioned cookout?

29:36.650 --> 29:39.563
God! How can it be dark already?

29:39.736 --> 29:42.069
It's four o'clock
in the afternoon.

29:42.239 --> 29:43.980
It's Purgatory -
wait 20 minutes,

29:44.157 --> 29:46.114
we'll be slathering on
the sunscreen.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.823
So, what did Dolls say again
about the talisman being...

29:48.996 --> 29:50.328
Buried in the ground.

29:50.497 --> 29:52.705
Buried.

29:52.874 --> 29:54.706
The witching hour.

29:54.876 --> 29:57.334
Perfect time to make a hole
for our friend, Waverly.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.496
Will this really
make them happy?

29:59.673 --> 30:02.541
This will guarantee
you all get what you deserve.

30:02.718 --> 30:03.754
Bobo.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.137
The name of my imaginary friend
when I was growing up - Bobo!

30:08.307 --> 30:12.642
And I'm starting to think
that he wasn't so imaginary.

30:12.811 --> 30:15.349
Ohhh...

30:15.522 --> 30:18.686
God, that's super-weird.
What's going on?

30:19.818 --> 30:21.650
The yard light's out.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.482
- I'll check the generator.
- What?

30:23.655 --> 30:25.487
What... Wynonna,
what's going on?

30:25.657 --> 30:27.694
Nothing. Just go inside.

30:27.868 --> 30:29.825
Waverly, go!

30:42.841 --> 30:45.925
DEEP, GROWLING VOICE:
Your hair smells like lilies.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.428
The flower of funerals.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.931
Worst pick-up line ever.

31:14.623 --> 31:16.740
OK, creepy giant revenant alert!

31:16.917 --> 31:18.783
Moves through shadows,
sucks in light,

31:18.960 --> 31:21.668
whispers things very high
on the disturb-o-meter.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.670
- You need to hide.
- What?! No! No way!

31:23.840 --> 31:25.376
Just until I get
'Peacemaker' back.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.882
You LOST 'Peacemaker'?!

31:27.052 --> 31:29.590
Just get in a closet,
under the bed,

31:29.763 --> 31:31.203
anywhere the darkness
can't find you.

31:31.306 --> 31:32.842
Those are the dark places!

31:33.016 --> 31:35.099
And hiding didn't
help me last time!

31:42.901 --> 31:45.484
Shadow man is one
of the revenants that took.

31:45.654 --> 31:46.815
Daddy and Willa.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.069
Oh, God.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.902
If that shit ticket thinks

31:50.075 --> 31:53.034
he's coming in here
uninvited again...

31:53.203 --> 31:56.446
OK. Oh, I love
when you say "shit ticket".

32:06.133 --> 32:08.841
OK, where is this thing?

32:12.764 --> 32:16.257
- What?
- Waverly, behind you!

32:20.272 --> 32:23.140
Oh, my God!

32:23.316 --> 32:25.308
- OK. Oh, shit.
- Oh, God!

32:25.485 --> 32:26.521
Quick! Quick, OK?

32:26.695 --> 32:29.733
Come on, you stupid junker!

32:29.906 --> 32:31.693
- Hello.
- Oh, God!

32:31.867 --> 32:33.529
- He's draining the battery!
- Run!

32:33.702 --> 32:35.068
- I'll hold him off.
- No! No way!

32:35.245 --> 32:37.328
OK, this is Earp land, our land!

32:37.497 --> 32:38.897
We can't hold off
revenants from it.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.679
- Not until we find the talisman.
- I know.

32:40.750 --> 32:42.412
Because I'm the one
who buried it.

32:44.713 --> 32:48.206
Oh, good idea, but we'll
never cross the fence line.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.669
- He probably couldn't!
- No!

32:49.843 --> 32:51.550
He said it had to be an Earp!

32:51.720 --> 32:54.178
That if I buried the talisman
in the pet cemetery,

32:54.347 --> 32:56.304
it would stop Mom and Dad
from fighting!

32:56.475 --> 32:57.761
Move your butt, girl!

33:01.855 --> 33:05.474
It's here, beside Pikachu the hamster's
final resting place.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.892
Right. Oh, God,
I can't see a thing!

33:08.069 --> 33:08.900
Hey! Hey!

33:09.070 --> 33:11.090
Hey, Dolls, listen. Scary
light-sucking demon on our ass.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.982
I know. I get the gist. End it.
You're the only one that can.

33:14.159 --> 33:15.616
Yes.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.118
Dig your own graves.

33:18.288 --> 33:20.496
What was that metallic sound?

33:20.665 --> 33:21.665
Jim Miller!

33:21.750 --> 33:23.958
Yeah, Killer Miller
used to wear a plate.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.119
An old-time bulletproof vest!
It's gotta be him!

33:26.296 --> 33:29.255
- Your research is impeccable.
- Thank you.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.874
- What are you doing?
- Cover me?

33:39.059 --> 33:41.802
Hey! Big and tall!

33:41.978 --> 33:44.766
Over here, freak nuts!
Come get it!

33:45.899 --> 33:47.765
OK.

33:49.110 --> 33:52.069
DEEP, GROWLING VOICE:
You are not the target.

33:52.239 --> 33:56.859
Bobo will be sad to lose you,
little sister...

33:57.035 --> 33:59.072
- Waverly's the target!
- What?! Why?

34:13.217 --> 34:15.210
Lights out, bitch.

34:23.937 --> 34:25.678
Find that talisman!

34:28.692 --> 34:32.060
Whoo! This just got crazy!

34:32.237 --> 34:35.775
Hey, guys, don't worry
about me. I got this!

34:35.949 --> 34:37.565
Wynonna! Move!

34:50.880 --> 34:52.246
Ugh!

34:52.424 --> 34:55.838
Having an axe for anything
but wood maintenance is a felony.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.173
- Hey, sis, finish him!
- No!

34:59.514 --> 35:02.348
I need him to send a message.

35:02.517 --> 35:05.476
I'm a dead man, anyway.
Just do it.

35:05.645 --> 35:10.140
Tell your boss, whoever he is,
that I'm coming for him,

35:10.317 --> 35:11.933
coming for all the revenants

35:12.110 --> 35:14.477
who attacked the homestead
and took Willa.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.145
The Seven?

35:16.323 --> 35:18.986
That hunting party's got
three dead heirs under their belts.

35:19.159 --> 35:20.775
You're just a girl.

35:20.952 --> 35:25.071
I am THE girl
with the big-ass gun.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.161
And one by one, I am going

35:28.335 --> 35:32.204
to blow you all to hell.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.461
Oh.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.342
Got it!

35:38.511 --> 35:40.673
OK! Batter up!

35:50.815 --> 35:54.684
Oh, come on, that was hilarious!

35:57.197 --> 35:59.234
How'd you know
about the ammolite?

35:59.407 --> 36:01.820
Been battling demons
for a while now.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.111
Yeah, how does a big-city boy
end up here,

36:05.288 --> 36:07.746
working for Black Badge?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.953
I was recruited
from the military.

36:10.126 --> 36:11.742
For your awesome sense
of humour?

36:11.920 --> 36:15.834
Because I'm very good
at killing very bad guys.

36:18.927 --> 36:20.418
If people here find out

36:20.595 --> 36:22.587
that this is ground zero
in a paranormal war,

36:22.764 --> 36:25.757
will you really do to Purgatory
what you did in New Mexico?

36:25.934 --> 36:29.678
I didn't give the orders
to nuke Maldito.

36:29.854 --> 36:32.016
I did everything
I could to stop it.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.232
- Dolls...
- Go home.

36:39.406 --> 36:42.649
And get to making it
a home, Wynonna.

36:42.826 --> 36:45.193
Ooh! Do I get a badge?

36:45.370 --> 36:48.613
A code name?
Oh, my God, a flamethrower?

36:48.790 --> 36:52.500
You will be
a Black Badge consultant.

36:52.669 --> 36:55.628
And remember our deal.
You move in here with me.

36:55.797 --> 36:57.789
Long as I get to pick
the new colour scheme.

36:57.966 --> 36:59.832
OK, I'm thinking lots of pink.

37:00.009 --> 37:01.921
Just try it, kid.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.428
Oh, come on,
we could make it nice.

37:04.597 --> 37:07.715
Look, we're already getting
a shiny new mailbox.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.099
For some reason.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.603
Yeah, Henry wanted
to replace it,

37:13.773 --> 37:18.438
seeing as it had been
"defiled by hooligans".

37:20.447 --> 37:24.316
Such a shame all the men
in this town are insane.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.654
- Well, he can't be a revenant.
- Hmm.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.945
Not with the ammolite
working again, right?

37:29.122 --> 37:30.613
So not the enemy.

37:30.790 --> 37:33.157
Not quite a friend?

37:33.334 --> 37:35.496
Not a bad sight
in Champ's jeans, right?

37:35.670 --> 37:38.333
- Just saying.
- That sneaky sonofabitch!

37:38.506 --> 37:42.500
Yeah, well, most of my stolen stuff
was returned, OK?

37:42.677 --> 37:44.964
And he's just one of
those crazy Wyatt fans.

37:45.138 --> 37:46.800
Hmm...

37:46.973 --> 37:49.056
No, he's definitely
one of the good guys.

37:49.225 --> 37:50.841
Everything in my body tells me

37:51.019 --> 37:53.386
he's one of the bad boys.

37:53.563 --> 37:55.145
My entire body.

37:55.315 --> 37:57.648
Don't you think
he's a little old for you?

37:57.817 --> 38:00.355
Careful now, I can still demote you
to Black Badge mascot.

38:10.330 --> 38:13.789
I've been blaming you
for what happened to Daddy...

38:13.958 --> 38:15.574
to Willa.

38:15.752 --> 38:19.496
I was the one who planted
the talisman. It's my fault.

38:19.672 --> 38:21.959
- Bobo tricked you.
- Still...

38:22.133 --> 38:24.716
And when I find
your not-so-imaginary friend,

38:24.886 --> 38:27.048
oh, honey, I'm gonna
make him pay.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.138
Just be careful.

38:30.308 --> 38:31.844
- OK?
- Yeah.

38:32.018 --> 38:34.886
Careful's not really my style.

38:35.063 --> 38:38.773
Besides, how scared can you be
of a guy named 'Bobo'?

38:48.827 --> 38:54.539
I hear tell
the heir lit up your shadow.

38:54.707 --> 38:58.166
Seems she is more
than we bargained for.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.043
Apparently, you are too.

39:00.213 --> 39:01.670
So then I've earned
your loyalty?

39:01.840 --> 39:04.548
It's a moving target.

39:04.717 --> 39:08.506
Now, Levi, on the other hand,

39:08.680 --> 39:13.141
he promised to bring me
Wynonna's head.

39:13.309 --> 39:17.178
But instead, he gave her
some very sensitive information.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.642
Now, didn't you, Levi?

39:19.816 --> 39:21.933
He had a lot to say
about you too.

39:25.113 --> 39:28.402
But, still, you've proven
to be on our side,

39:28.575 --> 39:31.613
and now I wanna show you
what happens to the ones who aren't.

39:31.786 --> 39:35.655
- What are you gonna do with him?
- I'm not gonna do anything.

39:35.832 --> 39:38.666
But you, you're gonna drag him

39:38.835 --> 39:41.043
over to that wheel
and chain him up,

39:41.212 --> 39:43.204
across the line.

39:43.381 --> 39:45.498
- What line?
- The line that keeps us here.

39:45.675 --> 39:48.042
You see, when you drag
a revenant across the line,

39:48.219 --> 39:50.962
it gets, uh... ugly.

39:52.682 --> 39:55.095
But if you wanna be in...

40:02.191 --> 40:05.184
No.

40:10.158 --> 40:14.573
I am sorry, Levi,
but it's you or me.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.033
Please! Please!
Please don't do this!

40:17.206 --> 40:19.744
Forget what I said.
You're a good man!

40:19.918 --> 40:22.126
You got a... You got a code!

40:22.295 --> 40:24.252
You don't wanna do this! No!

40:24.422 --> 40:27.210
You have no idea what I want.

40:37.644 --> 40:40.557
First, Malcolm went rogue...

40:40.730 --> 40:42.938
then Red, and now Levi.

40:43.107 --> 40:47.226
All who fled our flock
in a futile attempt

40:47.403 --> 40:50.862
to master a gun that, as of now,
has only a mistress.

40:51.032 --> 40:55.072
Let no other revenant
turn away from my guidance...

40:55.244 --> 41:00.160
on punishment of banishment
and living hell on this Earth.

41:00.333 --> 41:03.667
I swear to you,
our salvation lies

41:03.836 --> 41:06.749
not in thieving 'Peacemaker'...

41:06.923 --> 41:09.757
or defeating the heir...

41:09.926 --> 41:11.758
but in the dig!

41:11.928 --> 41:13.339
Yeah.

41:13.513 --> 41:14.845
We stick to the plan!

41:15.014 --> 41:16.926
We stay on course.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.308
We let the Seven deal
with the heir

41:19.477 --> 41:21.685
while the rest of us work,
as we've been working

41:21.854 --> 41:24.346
for 15 years,
towards one common goal.

41:24.524 --> 41:27.232
Freedom!

41:47.255 --> 41:51.090
I'm a man of my word, Henry.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.252
I can give her to you.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.967
The woman that changed you.

42:00.768 --> 42:03.476
Well, then, Bobo...

42:03.646 --> 42:07.139
we are officially in business.

42:16.034 --> 42:20.119
Arggh! Arggh!
