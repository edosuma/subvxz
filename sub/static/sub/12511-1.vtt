00:20.395 --> 00:22.981
Yeah!
Raise the roof for your class song,

00:23.065 --> 00:26.318
"I'm Too Sexy"
by Right Said Fred.

00:26.401 --> 00:32.198
Now, it's time to give it up
for your 1991 prom king and queen,

00:32.281 --> 00:34.826
Ted-O and Nikki!

00:37.996 --> 00:39.831
Ted-O. Ted-O.

00:39.915 --> 00:42.042
Ted-O. Ted-O. Ted-O.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.087
Vincent!

00:59.685 --> 01:01.270
Reunions are strange.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.022
They bring up a lot of
feelings about your past.

01:05.022 --> 01:06.441
Were you a jock?

01:06.525 --> 01:08.235
A pothead?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.570
A drama club kid?

01:12.030 --> 01:13.907
A loser?

01:13.991 --> 01:17.828
Did you get the girl...
or did she ever even notice you?

01:18.620 --> 01:22.332
Who did you want to be,
and who did you actually become?

01:26.253 --> 01:27.629
Damn, Charlie.

01:27.713 --> 01:30.424
Are you still hung up on that skank?

01:30.966 --> 01:32.050
Hey.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.929
You forgot the guy who showed you
your first pair of tits?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.766
You're givin' me dead eyes?
It's me!

01:39.850 --> 01:41.268
It's Maxi-Pad!

01:43.103 --> 01:44.604
Max Kessler!

01:44.730 --> 01:46.189
- Come on.
- Oh, my God.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.483
I haven't seen you in forever. Wow.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.819
So, how is your mother?

01:50.902 --> 01:54.031
Oh, well, you wouldn't want to
check her out in the shower these days.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.574
Not lookin' too good.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.160
You know, I still think she might have
known that we were watching.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.829
Are you kiddin' me? That's why she
winked at you in the middle.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.874
You were her little Macaulay Culkin.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.673
Man, these two assholes
deserve each other.

02:12.174 --> 02:15.135
They actually got divorced.
They're still really good friends though.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.637
I see that.

02:20.599 --> 02:23.560
They had twins together,
but she got remarried.

02:23.644 --> 02:24.686
Wow.

02:24.770 --> 02:28.273
Imagine if her husband was here right now
watching that alcoholic hosebag

02:28.357 --> 02:30.150
fucking dry hump her ex.

02:31.193 --> 02:32.944
He is here, actually.

02:33.612 --> 02:38.116
Oh, hey, congratulations.
That's good news, man.

02:38.200 --> 02:41.328
I wish you would've told me before
I called your wife an alcoholic hosebag.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.205
But, that's... that's excellent.

02:44.748 --> 02:47.292
Whoa. Excuse me, one second.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.961
Hey, come on. Ted-O.
No, no. No... too much.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.338
Oh, God.

02:51.421 --> 02:54.341
Ha! I'm sorry. Whoo!

02:54.424 --> 02:56.968
It's the goddamn Funky Bunch, baby!

02:57.052 --> 02:59.262
I lose my shit! Every time.

03:00.806 --> 03:02.974
Relax, Charlie,
we were just dancin'.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.393
You don't have to make a scene.

03:04.476 --> 03:07.187
He's making a scene? You're the one
getting a pap smear out here.

03:07.312 --> 03:09.648
I wasn't getting a pap smear,
shit-for-brains.

03:09.731 --> 03:10.732
- Hey, hey.
- No, no.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.110
Here's what happened,
all right? Here's what happened.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.277
I think we had a little...

03:14.361 --> 03:16.947
few too many beers
and we're just gonna call it a night.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.198
Okay, fine.

03:18.281 --> 03:20.534
Let's go, Mr. Buzzkill. Ah!

03:20.617 --> 03:23.203
You know I can't leave right now,
I'm the class treasurer.

03:23.286 --> 03:25.622
I have to settle up
with the DJ and the hotel.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.832
- Okay? You...
- You know what?

03:26.915 --> 03:28.583
Jimmy Badboy's got a limo.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.877
Now, she could just hop right in
with me if you wanted.

03:30.961 --> 03:32.641
- If it's all right.
- Oh, that sounds great.

03:32.712 --> 03:34.714
- Yeah?
- Let me ask my dad.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.801
Hey, listen, it's better than
drinking and driving.

03:37.884 --> 03:40.762
Yes, okay, fine.
I'll see you at home.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.223
- It's a limousine.
- All right.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.435
I'll take good care of her. Whoo!

03:46.518 --> 03:48.019
I'm sorry.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.105
If I'm remembering correctly,

03:50.188 --> 03:54.109
Charlie McMillan always
loved himself a Bud Light.

03:56.278 --> 04:00.657
How about that time my father took us
on the drive-along in his cop car.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.701
Oh, I remember that.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.745
And that guy we had to arrest,

04:04.828 --> 04:07.164
who kept flashing everybody
at the 7-Eleven.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.124
You stuck me in the backseat
with that guy!

04:09.207 --> 04:13.962
Yeah, who would have thought a guy could
whack off with a set of handcuffs on?

04:16.089 --> 04:18.550
Why did we ever stop hangin' out?

04:18.632 --> 04:20.927
We lived right across the street
from each other.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.430
I don't know.
We had different classes.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.557
Yeah, you were with all the smart kids.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.019
I was in shop class
making bird cages and foot stools.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.270
Yeah.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.105
And after your dad died...

04:32.189 --> 04:35.025
Yeah, I wasn't too social after that, huh?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.821
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
Growing up without a dad.

04:41.364 --> 04:42.699
But you're in Jacksonville now.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.451
Tell me about yourself.
I don't know anything.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.287
Remember how we said we were gonna
kick ass and take names?

04:47.370 --> 04:48.371
Oh, yeah, we did.

04:48.455 --> 04:50.707
You were going to invent time travel,
weren't you?

04:50.791 --> 04:53.919
And you were gonna be
an FBI agent.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.086
That's right.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.339
Mr. Falcone, our guidance counselor,

04:57.422 --> 05:00.425
said I was gonna
end up working in the morgue.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.844
- He did not like you.
- Yeah.

05:02.928 --> 05:07.140
But I guess old Mr. Falcone
can suck my dick.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.518
Shut up! Shut...

05:09.601 --> 05:12.103
Are you kidding me?
You did it?

05:12.187 --> 05:13.939
Oh, my God, man!

05:14.022 --> 05:16.024
Are you packin' heat?

05:17.776 --> 05:18.944
Jesus!

05:20.070 --> 05:21.363
My God.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.407
Have you ever had to...
shoot anybody?

05:24.491 --> 05:26.618
I don't kill and tell, Charlie.

05:26.701 --> 05:28.703
These are human beings
we're talking about.

05:28.787 --> 05:29.788
Yeah.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
Eight people.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.669
Are you kidding me, dude?
This is cra...

05:36.670 --> 05:40.507
Oh... Oh, yeah, that. I...

05:40.590 --> 05:42.217
I have not done that. That's...

05:42.300 --> 05:44.469
I did it with you.
That was the last time.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.012
Yep.

05:46.096 --> 05:48.723
It's good to see me again, ain't it?

05:48.807 --> 05:50.976
Wait, right...
Smoke it right here?

05:51.059 --> 05:53.311
You're runnin' with the law tonight,
Charlie.

05:53.395 --> 05:55.063
You're an untouchable.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.275
That's right.

06:08.034 --> 06:09.035
Oh... here.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.079
Oh, no, I can't.

06:11.162 --> 06:14.082
Fucking Bureau does random tests.
You want to get me fired?

06:14.708 --> 06:15.750
Oh...

06:15.834 --> 06:18.670
So, what else, Charlie?

06:18.753 --> 06:20.380
Believe it or not...

06:20.463 --> 06:23.717
I still actually work at the same place
I worked in high school.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.844
Save & Pay Supermarket?

06:26.595 --> 06:29.472
No. No, I've never worked at Save & Pay.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.475
I manage the bank that's
inside of Save & Pay.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.562
Palm Coast Savings Bank has
nothing to do with the supermarket.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.063
Except the fact that it's in it.

06:37.147 --> 06:39.983
Right, it's in it,
but that doesn't mean it's a part of it.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.860
It's its own entity.

06:41.943 --> 06:44.613
So if the supermarket was closed,
could I get into the bank?

06:44.696 --> 06:46.114
Wouldn't happen.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.658
We keep banking hours,
so we close before them.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.077
You keep telling yourself that, Charlie.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.497
Where you living?

06:54.581 --> 06:56.166
I live in the same house.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.834
- Yeah?
- Yeah, Oakmont.

06:57.917 --> 07:01.171
Man, if you still had that Gremlin
piece of shit you used to drive,

07:01.254 --> 07:02.714
we'd be right back in high school.

07:02.797 --> 07:05.508
The old Gremlin.
I remember that.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.010
Yeah, I still have it.

07:07.093 --> 07:08.678
- You're shittin' me.
- Yeah.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.889
- So, basically, everything...
- It's the same.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.349
Yeah, it's the same.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.601
But things are good, man.
Things are great.

07:15.477 --> 07:17.062
It's going great, seriously.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.106
Come on, let's get real.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.444
Let Maxi-Pad soak up your pain.

07:31.242 --> 07:32.661
My life fuckin' sucks.

07:32.744 --> 07:33.870
Yeah.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.415
I drive the same car.
I have the same job.

07:37.999 --> 07:39.167
I talk to the same people.

07:39.250 --> 07:41.002
I'm chasing the same girl...

07:41.086 --> 07:43.129
except now I pay
all her credit card bills.

07:43.213 --> 07:44.714
She still doesn't care about me.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.549
I mean, I talked to these people tonight,

07:46.633 --> 07:50.887
they're going parasailing,
motorcycle racing, cliff diving.

07:50.971 --> 07:54.849
Oh, fuck all the people tonight.
They're all fat and old-lookin'.

07:54.933 --> 07:56.935
Go to Antigua.
Jump off a cliff.

07:57.018 --> 07:59.437
I'm too much of a pussy.
I would never do that.

07:59.521 --> 08:01.523
Plus, I can't.
I can't go to Antigua.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.817
I can't go anywhere,
I don't have a passport.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.068
Oh!

08:05.151 --> 08:07.779
You're not a pussy, Charlie.
You never were a pussy.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.240
I'm just in a rut... a bad one.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.200
I have so many responsibilities.

08:12.283 --> 08:14.244
Like putting Ted-O's twins
through college?

08:14.911 --> 08:16.871
Exactly, that is on the list.

08:16.955 --> 08:19.666
I mean, what the hell happened to my life?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.210
Can't give up hope, bud.

08:23.003 --> 08:26.506
Wish I could start from scratch.
Just get it right this time.

08:32.220 --> 08:36.140
Hey, maybe this is the weed,
I think there's some girl spying on us.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.727
- 5'5"?
- Yeah.

08:38.809 --> 08:39.936
- Dark wig?
- Yeah.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.104
- Button nose?
- Yeah.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.897
- Don't acknowledge her.
- Oh.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.026
It's my fucking psycho ex-girlfriend.

08:46.109 --> 08:47.318
Is she stalkin' you?

08:47.402 --> 08:48.945
She can't quit me.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.698
- I gotta talk to her.
- No, wait. Wait.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.662
- I miss you.
- Well... good.

08:57.746 --> 08:58.955
- Change your mind.
- Nope.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.915
- Please.
- You gotta just fucking be tough.

09:00.999 --> 09:02.459
Just toughen the fuck...

09:03.168 --> 09:04.544
Oh, I hate you.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:14.763 --> 09:16.306
She's gonna leave you alone now.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.224
No, I gave her my hotel key.

09:18.308 --> 09:19.851
She drove all the way out here.

09:19.934 --> 09:23.104
Might as well feed the giraffe a carrot
before I send her back to the zoo,

09:23.188 --> 09:24.272
you know what I mean.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.565
Damn it, man.

09:25.648 --> 09:28.568
You are kicking ass and taking names.
You're doing it.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.612
You should be doing that with me, Charlie.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.323
- Like we always talked about.
- Yeah.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.451
Hey... I hope I see you again.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.994
Yeah, me, too.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.186
Yeah. No, I'm here.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.813
That's right.
I got dinner.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.649
It's covered. I got Chinese.
Everything you want.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.275
I got the six egg rolls,

10:09.359 --> 10:11.444
four orange chickens,
two Kung Pao chickens.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.904
Just the way you like it.

10:12.987 --> 10:14.280
Oh... okay.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.327
Uh... I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.
Uh, you sure?

10:19.410 --> 10:21.955
Two more... Two more Kung Pao chickens,
are you sure?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.833
- Excuse me.
- Okay, I gotta go. Bye.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.292
Are you the manager?

10:26.376 --> 10:28.086
Why, yes I am.
How can I help you?

10:28.169 --> 10:32.048
Can you tell me where I can find
the kitty litter aisle?

10:32.132 --> 10:34.467
Actually, I'm the bank manager.

10:34.551 --> 10:35.552
Oh...

10:35.635 --> 10:39.305
Palm Coast Savings is a bank
and we have nothing to do with Save & Pay.

10:40.098 --> 10:41.224
Kitty litter?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.726
It's aisle two.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.740
Hey.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.659
How was karate, boys?

10:59.742 --> 11:00.910
See for yourself!

11:04.164 --> 11:06.457
Hey, Mom, check it out.
Charlie pissed his pants.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.301
Are you sure
you're not yankin' my crank?

11:16.384 --> 11:17.552
This is real?

11:17.635 --> 11:20.013
All expenses paid?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.223
Naples, Italy?

11:23.266 --> 11:25.143
Naples, Florida?

11:26.060 --> 11:28.438
Oh!
Oh, my God, we so need this.

11:28.563 --> 11:29.564
- Thank you.
- What is it?

11:29.647 --> 11:31.524
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.943
I just won a two-day spa weekend

11:34.027 --> 11:37.030
at the Ritz-Carlton Resort
in Naples, Florida!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.489
What?

11:38.573 --> 11:40.408
What? How?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.578
I won the grand prize drawin'
at the reunion.

11:43.661 --> 11:46.414
I don't even remember there being
a drawing at the reunion.

11:46.497 --> 11:49.584
I don't remember the reunion.
But I'll fucking take it.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.002
Yeah. Woo-hoo!

11:51.085 --> 11:53.129
Party train.
When is it?

11:53.212 --> 11:55.423
- This weekend.
- Oh, that's perfect.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.550
Tracy is gonna get turnt up.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.010
Tracy?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.929
I thought this was our weekend together?

12:01.012 --> 12:03.598
Well, Charlie, it's a spa.

12:03.681 --> 12:06.351
It's totally
a girls' type of thing.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.102
- Oh.
- It's... it's... Oh!

12:08.186 --> 12:10.229
- Oh, okay.
- But, hey... Charlie,

12:10.355 --> 12:12.690
this will give you time
to paint the garage.

12:12.774 --> 12:13.983
Oh, yeah, right...

12:15.109 --> 12:18.529
Oh, my God, they accept dogs!
Tracy's bringing Biscuit!

12:19.364 --> 12:21.741
All right, that sounds fun.

12:23.576 --> 12:26.287
Where the fuck are the fortune cookies?

12:33.586 --> 12:37.382
Karate chop me, you little prick.
I wasn't ready for it.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.385
You ready for this?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.680
Asshole.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.258
Ahoy.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.802
And then it happened.

13:22.885 --> 13:25.054
Permission to come aboard, skipper?

13:25.138 --> 13:28.933
Permission granted, little buddy.
You ready to get your drink on?

13:30.143 --> 13:33.938
Oh, my God.
That is not a Bud Light Party Ball.

13:34.022 --> 13:35.690
If you put your ear to it just right,

13:35.773 --> 13:39.736
you can still hear somebody puking
at a Def Leppard concert.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.447
Huh? Huh?

13:42.530 --> 13:44.699
Uh, but I shouldn't
have a drink right away,

13:44.782 --> 13:48.786
because I popped a few Dramamine just to,
you know, help me get my sea legs.

13:48.870 --> 13:50.163
- Oh...
- But, um...

13:50.246 --> 13:54.375
I did get us some Sea-Band bracelets.

13:54.459 --> 13:56.502
One of the cashiers at Save & Pay

13:56.586 --> 13:59.380
said that this is a miracle worker
for her mother-in-law.

13:59.464 --> 14:00.715
- I get one, too?
- Yeah.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.467
Oh, thanks, man.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.511
So, uh, what do you think of my boat?

14:05.595 --> 14:09.140
This is... insane.
I've never seen anything like it.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.642
My God, I gotta join the FBI.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.436
How long have you had her?

14:13.519 --> 14:15.063
She's a virgin.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.940
I want you to pop her cherry.

14:18.024 --> 14:20.485
- Me?
- Yeah. Grab this.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.071
- What do I do?
- Come on.

14:23.154 --> 14:27.158
- To, uh, kickin' ass and taking names!
- There he is.

14:27.241 --> 14:29.911
- You fuck!
- Are you shitting me?

14:29.994 --> 14:31.204
You brought it back to my...

14:31.287 --> 14:33.706
I'm fucking with you. Yeah!

14:47.804 --> 14:50.765
Yeah. Yeah, man.

15:03.986 --> 15:05.613
Hi!

15:05.696 --> 15:06.989
Hi, guys!

15:12.203 --> 15:13.996
Hey, girls, come on.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.874
Huh?

15:22.713 --> 15:24.590
Fuck, yeah.
Thank you!

15:26.384 --> 15:28.970
- Oh... Oh! "Show us your dick."
- No.

15:29.053 --> 15:31.180
Show them.
Don't even think about it.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.473
Let's see it.
Come on! Come on!

15:32.557 --> 15:34.600
Okay. Okay.

15:38.563 --> 15:41.315
- Oh!
- Boo!

15:43.151 --> 15:45.361
- What the hell is that?
- Come on!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.417
I couldn't believe it.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.669
I was having the best time
of my adult life.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.386
It was like Max and I had
never been apart.

16:13.222 --> 16:17.393
The years melted away and we were goofy
teenagers again, having nothing but fun.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.313
Max!

16:26.319 --> 16:30.364
Forgetting my troubles for a while
was just what the doctor ordered.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.536
- Wow!
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

16:38.122 --> 16:41.375
Fuckin' A, baby!
You got dinner for us!

16:45.713 --> 16:48.216
Fuck you! Fuck you!

17:07.151 --> 17:10.820
Deep down, I knew that soon
I'd have to get back to the real world.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.906
But Max had a way
of making me forget all my...

17:40.226 --> 17:41.310
Hey.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.314
What's...

17:59.954 --> 18:01.831
Hey, Mr. Sleepyhead.

18:02.873 --> 18:04.417
What's going on?

18:04.500 --> 18:06.252
Why am...
Why am I tied up?

18:06.335 --> 18:08.588
I didn't want you to freak out
when you came to.

18:08.671 --> 18:11.340
You think tying me to a bed's
not gonna freak me out?

18:11.424 --> 18:13.426
- Where the hell am I?
- You're in a motel.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.804
You were snoring your balls off
for, like, 24 hours straight.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.848
Wait, what? What?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.517
Yeah, I guess I went
a little heavy on the roofies.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.768
You roofied me?

18:22.852 --> 18:25.521
Max, please let me go.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.690
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not a problem, buddy.

18:27.773 --> 18:28.941
Let me get you out of there.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.278
I got you in a half hitch.
You know who taught me that knot?

18:32.361 --> 18:35.281
Your father,
when we went fishing that day.

18:35.364 --> 18:38.868
Your equilibrium's gonna be way off
'cause of the drugs.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.286
So just kind of take it easy

18:40.369 --> 18:42.288
- when I get you free, okay?
- Uh-huh.

18:42.371 --> 18:43.831
There you go.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.462
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

18:51.422 --> 18:54.759
- Charlie, I told you.
- Oh, God.

18:54.842 --> 18:56.177
Come here.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.096
Just do it, serial killer.
Kill me, get it over with!

18:59.180 --> 19:01.974
I'm not gonna kill you.
What the fuck are you talking about?

19:02.058 --> 19:04.518
Sit down.
You know why I'm not gonna kill you?

19:04.602 --> 19:06.604
Because you're already dead.

19:06.687 --> 19:08.689
- What?
- I did it, Charlie.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.859
I pulled off the greatest magic act
of all time.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.944
I made us disappear.

19:14.028 --> 19:16.238
Wait, you did what?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.366
I faked our deaths.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.785
Charlie, look at this.

19:20.868 --> 19:25.456
I maxed out all my credit cards'
cash advances.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.876
$62,000!

19:28.959 --> 19:31.504
Dead people don't have to pay their bills.

19:31.587 --> 19:35.424
So Amex can blow me.
And you wanted a passport.

19:39.345 --> 19:40.429
Huh?

19:40.513 --> 19:42.306
Where the fuck is it?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.559
Oh!

19:45.643 --> 19:49.980
You are officially now
Dr. Ronald P. Fishman, world traveler.

19:51.315 --> 19:55.486
- You were sleeping.
- I don't wanna be Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.

19:55.569 --> 19:56.737
Well, you can't be Butch Ryder,

19:56.821 --> 19:59.907
'cause I already put my picture
on this one, so, you snooze, you lose.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.368
Max, why are you doing this?

20:02.451 --> 20:05.246
So you could start from scratch.
Get a brand new life.

20:05.329 --> 20:06.831
I made your wish come true.

20:06.914 --> 20:11.335
That night... I was stoned!
I didn't know what I was saying!

20:11.419 --> 20:13.295
Where's Dr. Fishman?

20:13.379 --> 20:15.798
At the bottom of the ocean...
with Butch Ryder.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.467
Jesus Christ,
how many people did you kill?

20:19.552 --> 20:22.596
I didn't kill anybody.
I just borrowed two dead bodies.

20:22.680 --> 20:24.765
Charlie, calm down.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.518
You have a right to be mad,
'cause I did lie to you.

20:27.601 --> 20:28.728
I'm not in the FBI.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.772
I made that up 'cause I was embarrassed
of where my life turned out.

20:31.856 --> 20:35.484
I am a coroner.
At the city morgue.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.486
Mr. Falcone was right!

20:37.570 --> 20:38.738
I stack bodies for a living.

20:38.821 --> 20:41.407
Just like he uncannily predicted.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.451
I can't believe this.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.703
Hey, we both needed a fresh start.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.206
And when these two
age-appropriate bodies rolled in...

20:49.290 --> 20:52.460
no one claimed them for a week,
I... fake-cremated them.

20:52.543 --> 20:53.878
And I put 'em on ice.

20:54.837 --> 20:57.923
This is exactly why I had to stop
hanging out with you, Max.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.925
It's coming back to me.
You're crazy.

21:00.009 --> 21:02.762
This is too much. It's too much.
I can't do it. I can't.

21:02.845 --> 21:06.140
Hey, you have to do this,
or we're looking at five to ten...

21:06.223 --> 21:07.516
for faking our own deaths.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.311
Plus, I didn't opt for the fuckin'
insurance on the boat rental.

21:10.394 --> 21:11.812
So that...
that'll fuck me, man.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.065
Max, I... I'm gonna go home, okay?
I gotta go home.

21:15.149 --> 21:16.776
Charlie, you wanna go home?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.903
To that miserable wife and those kids?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.738
And the Save & Pay job?

21:20.821 --> 21:23.491
I don't work at Save & fucking Pay!

21:25.326 --> 21:26.535
Charlie...

21:27.787 --> 21:29.121
you tried.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.920
- Go on.
- Um...

21:36.962 --> 21:38.964
You made a good casserole.

21:39.048 --> 21:42.635
I feel real sad that you were a Democrat.

21:42.718 --> 21:43.969
And, um...

21:45.304 --> 21:47.056
I don't know what else to say.

21:47.139 --> 21:49.767
I think you said it all, baby.
I think you said it all.

21:51.268 --> 21:55.648
Charlie McMillan and I went
to school together our entire lives.

21:55.731 --> 21:58.150
The first time I actually noticed him...

21:58.234 --> 22:00.528
was when he turned up at the firehouse

22:00.611 --> 22:04.114
to ask for my ex-wife's hand in marriage.

22:04.198 --> 22:06.659
Now, I didn't know whether to hit him...

22:06.742 --> 22:08.035
or hug him!

22:10.037 --> 22:11.455
Predictable.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.332
Reliable.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.334
Dependable!

22:15.417 --> 22:17.670
I'm not just talking about my Ford F-150.

22:17.753 --> 22:21.632
Talkin' about Charlie McMillan,
who I know for a fact,

22:21.715 --> 22:23.217
would want us to wrap this up

22:23.300 --> 22:25.140
so we can get home and watch
the Dolphins game.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.513
Am I right?
Five and two this season.

22:27.596 --> 22:29.640
Can I get a "Go Fish"?

22:29.723 --> 22:32.059
Let's go win this one for Charlie!
Come on, honey.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.064
- Aw.
- This is for you.

22:39.066 --> 22:42.528
Thank you.
Thanks, I appreciate it.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.101
Jesus.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.032
Touchdown, Dolphins!

23:28.115 --> 23:29.199
Yeah!

23:31.452 --> 23:33.787
And that
was the moment I realized

23:33.871 --> 23:36.457
I was glad Charlie McMillan was dead.

23:46.300 --> 23:48.427
My dry-cleaner showed up?

23:48.510 --> 23:51.472
Did not see that coming.
I love that guy.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.974
Why don't you go down there
and freak him out?

23:54.058 --> 23:56.602
Didn't expect to see you so quick.

23:56.685 --> 23:59.271
You think I'd miss my killer's funeral?

23:59.355 --> 24:01.398
There it is.
He's back.

24:01.482 --> 24:03.609
- Can I take a look?
- Go ahead.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.905
Who's this guy in the suit?

24:07.988 --> 24:10.449
Is that George Michael?
I have no idea.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.992
And what's this?

24:12.076 --> 24:14.495
Is that your crazy ex-girlfriend?
Is she here, too?

24:21.752 --> 24:23.462
What is she doing?

24:23.545 --> 24:25.005
Come on.

24:26.423 --> 24:27.591
Cut that shit.

24:30.094 --> 24:32.262
Hey, buddy.
You know you didn't really die.

24:32.346 --> 24:33.806
Why are you getting so worked up?

24:33.889 --> 24:35.015
Oh.

24:35.099 --> 24:36.975
Got a little too real for me for a minute.

24:39.687 --> 24:41.230
All right, well, this is it.

24:41.355 --> 24:44.191
So, what now, Butch Ryder?
You got me.

24:44.274 --> 24:45.359
Well, we're free men.

24:45.442 --> 24:47.611
We can do
whatever the fuck we want now.

24:47.695 --> 24:51.031
Actually, I stumbled upon something
that might be worth investigating.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.157
- Okay.
- See this key?

24:52.241 --> 24:54.201
- Yeah.
- Pick it up.

24:54.284 --> 24:55.619
Smell it.

24:55.703 --> 24:57.496
Mmm.

24:57.579 --> 24:58.747
Smells like shit.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.999
'Cause I found it up Butch Ryder's ass.

25:05.295 --> 25:08.215
Why would you be digging up
some dead guy's ass?

25:08.298 --> 25:10.843
You'd be surprised how many people
hide stuff up their ass.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.678
Important stuff.

25:12.761 --> 25:14.221
Pick it up, one more time.

25:14.304 --> 25:15.305
Here.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.686
Just, uh... What do you think?
What could that open up?

25:22.855 --> 25:25.023
This is a level 5-A security key.

25:25.107 --> 25:27.151
How fucking smart are you?

25:27.234 --> 25:29.403
Based on the tooth pattern,
I'd say it's foreign.

25:29.486 --> 25:31.405
Number suggests a Latin country.

25:32.406 --> 25:35.534
And the fact that it was
up some dead guy's butt...

25:35.617 --> 25:37.619
I would say it's a safety deposit box key.

25:37.703 --> 25:41.707
Charlie! How the fuck did you do that?
Could we find it?

25:41.790 --> 25:43.625
May I?

25:44.626 --> 25:48.338
As a manager of a bank,
I have access to a federal database.

25:48.422 --> 25:49.923
Should be able to provide a match.

25:50.007 --> 25:52.259
Let's go, baby.

25:56.138 --> 25:57.556
What?

25:57.639 --> 26:00.392
Oh, man.
Oh, man, this is it.

26:01.393 --> 26:08.233
That looks nice.
Banco Nacional de Puerto Rico.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.544
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

26:39.890 --> 26:43.018
Oh, no. They might have a
biometric identification process.

26:43.101 --> 26:44.436
That means we need fingerprints.

26:44.520 --> 26:46.730
Wish you would have told me that
before I blew up the bodies.

26:46.814 --> 26:48.065
I would have saved the hands.

26:48.148 --> 26:51.508
Well, hopefully, they have what's known as
a "document-based identification process."

26:51.568 --> 26:55.280
Just let me charm
the fucking skirt off this señorita.

27:00.536 --> 27:02.204
It's nice to be back.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.332
Assuming I've been here before...

27:05.415 --> 27:07.876
which I would know, obviously.

27:11.880 --> 27:12.881
Have we met?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.634
No, I don't believe we have.

27:15.717 --> 27:18.220
Right, 'cause you got
a very forgettable face.

27:19.263 --> 27:21.783
You want people to remember you,
maybe get a personality, right?

27:22.808 --> 27:25.686
You're not one of the Mario brothers,
are you?

27:25.769 --> 27:27.229
Hey, since his ID is in order,

27:27.312 --> 27:30.524
we'd like to be taken
to the safety deposit room immediately

27:30.607 --> 27:32.234
and be given privacy,

27:32.317 --> 27:35.404
which is our right
under the Banking Act of 1938.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.241
Of course.

27:41.618 --> 27:44.371
Oh, it fits.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.833
- Shit.
- Oh... it's a big one.

27:49.251 --> 27:50.669
- God!
- A little heavy for ya?

27:50.752 --> 27:51.879
Um, I got it.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.509
Whoa!

27:57.593 --> 27:59.928
I always wanted one of these.
A tablet! Dibs!

28:00.012 --> 28:01.722
Look at this!
All this money!

28:01.805 --> 28:03.307
Dibs! Dibs! On the money!

28:03.390 --> 28:06.935
Max, there's gotta be like a
million bucks in here! You're rich!

28:07.019 --> 28:08.019
That's great!

28:09.021 --> 28:10.772
Oh, and this.
What's this?

28:11.732 --> 28:12.774
There's a note.

28:15.527 --> 28:18.655
"Butch, here are the keys
to your secret hideaway,

28:18.739 --> 28:22.326
where I know you'll find
the peace and quiet you're looking for.

28:22.409 --> 28:25.704
I hope you enjoy many happy,
healthy years here.

28:25.787 --> 28:30.417
You deserve it, you sexy bastard.
Love... Dakota."

28:30.500 --> 28:33.629
Ooh, Dakota sounds hot.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.382
Yeah. There's the key!

28:37.466 --> 28:41.345
And it doesn't smell like shit.
I hope it has a good view!

28:47.643 --> 28:49.853
- Ah!
- Jesus.

28:49.937 --> 28:51.563
What?

28:51.647 --> 28:53.232
Who lived here, Bill Gates?

28:53.315 --> 28:55.984
Huge TV, definitely not my Zenith.

28:57.778 --> 28:59.529
Full bar!

28:59.613 --> 29:01.573
Oh, dude.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.743
Puerto Rico!

29:05.911 --> 29:08.664
There's, like, five houses in this house.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.082
Another pool!

29:15.379 --> 29:17.089
Place is gorgeous!

29:20.259 --> 29:22.302
We're gonna have the best time here, bud.

29:25.222 --> 29:26.306
Yeah!

29:30.435 --> 29:32.980
- Don't tell me you hid more bodies?
- No.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.524
I got dibs on the master suite.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.902
- I got dibs on the Ferrari!
- Oh...

29:38.986 --> 29:39.987
You dick.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.800
Yeah. That's it?

30:01.883 --> 30:03.844
No... Hey!

30:03.927 --> 30:05.095
- Hey!
- Hey!

30:06.346 --> 30:10.142
Hi, I wanted, real quick...
Just one second, if I could.

30:10.225 --> 30:14.771
I'm Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.
Hola, everybody.

30:14.855 --> 30:19.318
I'm an Aquarius and I have a red Ferrari
and I'm pretty sure I'm Jewish.

30:19.401 --> 30:25.532
I moved here, just down the road,
into a massive beachfront mansion.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.659
I just wanna tell you
that I'm gonna be getting drunk here

30:27.743 --> 30:29.411
every night for the rest of my life.

30:29.494 --> 30:34.583
The good news is, I'm buying your drinks
for the rest of your lives!

30:36.501 --> 30:37.627
I just...

30:37.711 --> 30:39.129
- Will you do... Yeah.
- I'll do it, I'll do it.

30:39.212 --> 30:41.465
And play "Who Let The Dogs Out."

30:41.548 --> 30:42.966
Who let the...

30:46.136 --> 30:47.554
Are you out of your fucking mind, man?

30:47.637 --> 30:49.723
What are you bringing
so much attention to us for?

30:49.806 --> 30:52.476
No, I said I was Dr. Ronald Fishman.

30:52.559 --> 30:54.186
And I'm the legendary Butch Ryder.

30:54.311 --> 30:57.397
But don't you think maybe somebody here
might know those guys for real?

30:57.481 --> 30:58.940
We don't even look like 'em.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.609
What do they look like?

31:03.904 --> 31:04.905
Oh, shit.

31:05.864 --> 31:07.532
Oh, my God!

31:07.616 --> 31:08.867
Oh, he's got tattoos.

31:08.950 --> 31:11.453
You have to get
those exact same tattoos as Butch.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.829
I do, do I?

31:12.913 --> 31:16.083
If Dr. Fishman has tattoos,
I'd go get 'em.

31:16.166 --> 31:19.836
He didn't have a tattoo,
but there's somethin' else that he had.

31:23.173 --> 31:26.176
Oh, yeah! I'll get an earring,
I don't care.

31:26.259 --> 31:27.844
You don't put this in your ear.

31:27.928 --> 31:29.221
Where does it go?

31:35.102 --> 31:39.022
Kickin' ass
and takin' names, baby!

31:42.275 --> 31:43.485
Yeah!

31:57.249 --> 31:58.834
Hmm...

31:58.917 --> 32:00.919
Hmm... hmm...

32:06.216 --> 32:08.093
No!

32:13.598 --> 32:14.683
Want a Popsicle?

32:14.766 --> 32:17.185
Do we have any cherry ones left?

32:17.269 --> 32:18.562
Yeah, one more.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.981
- Yes.
- Proud of you, man.

32:21.064 --> 32:23.400
You earned my respect last night.
You're a tough guy.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.653
You know, I wish
I did invent time travel.

32:26.736 --> 32:28.780
- Uh-huh.
- 'Cause I would go back to last night

32:28.864 --> 32:31.116
and not put a hole in my tongue!

32:32.325 --> 32:34.703
Jeez...
How many weird apps are here?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.246
Jenga.

32:36.329 --> 32:38.748
Why are you still
messing with that?

32:38.832 --> 32:40.667
Yeah, you're a computer genius.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.378
You think there's any place
they could have hid something on here?

32:43.462 --> 32:45.714
You know, like, behind a firewall
or some shit?

32:45.797 --> 32:48.383
It's not a computer.
It's a tablet.

32:48.467 --> 32:53.263
There is no firewall. What's on there
that's hidden you need to find?

32:54.681 --> 32:57.767
Some amateur porn?
Maybe Butch fuckin' Dakota?

32:57.851 --> 32:59.811
If I'm gonna be Butch,
I gotta know all his moves.

32:59.853 --> 33:03.732
Does he slap ass?
Is he a nipple flicker? Or...

33:03.815 --> 33:06.943
does he whip out the dildo
and go to town with that?

33:07.027 --> 33:08.028
Oh, that sounds like a party.

33:08.111 --> 33:10.405
Hi, I hope I'm not intruding.

33:10.489 --> 33:13.325
I'm Dawn DeFazio.
I'm your next door neighbor.

33:13.408 --> 33:15.994
Oh, hey, Dawn.
I'm Butch Ryder.

33:16.077 --> 33:19.247
This is my best friend, uh,
Dr. Ronald P. Fishman.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.166
The P stands for "pussy pounder."

33:22.834 --> 33:25.003
It's great to finally meet you.

33:25.086 --> 33:27.255
I was starting to think
you were never gonna move in.

33:27.339 --> 33:29.424
Yeah, the movers were here
about a month ago,

33:29.508 --> 33:32.302
but they were so hush-hush
about who was movin' in here.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.347
Like it was the president
or George Clooney or somethin'.

33:35.430 --> 33:36.932
Ah, that's interesting.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.684
I don't know what the big secret was.
It's just us.

33:39.768 --> 33:40.977
What do you think?

33:41.061 --> 33:42.479
You want a Corona?

33:42.562 --> 33:44.773
I'd tell you to pull up a lounge chair,
but we don't got no more.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.983
Maybe Dr. Ron'll
make you a little room.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.110
Ooh. Oh, I would love to.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.571
But actually, I'm running late
for my mani-pedi.

33:51.655 --> 33:55.867
I gotta get all pretty for tonight.
Oh, you two should come with.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.286
It's Rum Runner night at Club Oro.

34:13.927 --> 34:16.638
- Lookin' sharp, by the way, big boy.
- Really?

34:17.429 --> 34:19.766
You don't think this is too Magnum?

34:19.849 --> 34:22.101
You could never go too Magnum.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.728
Maybe lose the hat, though.

34:24.938 --> 34:26.690
Ooh, hola, neighbors.

34:26.773 --> 34:30.777
- Butch, Ronald, this is my co-pilot, Joan.
- Ah.

34:30.860 --> 34:34.447
Dawn dragged me along to make sure she
doesn't do anything to embarrass herself.

34:34.531 --> 34:35.824
Who's watching you, then?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.492
- Oh, you're funny.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:37.576 --> 34:41.454
Buenas noches. Welcome to
Rum Runner night here at Club Oro.

34:41.538 --> 34:44.248
I'm Jorge, I'm gonna be your
shooter boy for the evening.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.210
Jorge, nice to meet you.
Who's this crazy fuck over here?

34:47.293 --> 34:50.380
Oh, he's, uh, shooter boy-in-training.

34:50.463 --> 34:52.591
He's just watching, observing,
no need to worry.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.842
How can I help you?

34:53.925 --> 34:55.844
How about four Panty Droppers?

34:55.927 --> 34:58.972
Oh, yeah!
Naughty, naughty, naughty!

34:59.055 --> 35:00.599
- Whoo!
- Hey!

35:02.267 --> 35:04.603
Jorge, I don't think it worked.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.522
Maybe they're not wearing panties.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.357
Guilty!

35:27.751 --> 35:29.419
Wow!

35:29.502 --> 35:32.631
- You boys can still bust a move, huh?
- Oh, yeah!

35:32.714 --> 35:34.633
Not bad for a couple of old farts.

35:34.716 --> 35:37.385
Please, I got you both beat.
How old are you?

35:37.469 --> 35:39.763
I'll put it to you this way,
we're over the speed limit.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.015
- No way! Y'all aren't 55.
- Mmm-mmm.

35:42.098 --> 35:45.268
You're right, Joan.
This guy just had his 57th birthday.

35:46.186 --> 35:50.148
Well, I've never been
afraid of doing over 55.

35:50.231 --> 35:53.401
Easy, Dawn. You're gonna overheat.

35:53.485 --> 35:55.654
We need to make a pit stop
in the little girls' room.

35:55.737 --> 35:58.615
Don't flood your engines
in there, huh?

35:58.698 --> 36:00.492
We got a long ride ahead of us.

36:01.868 --> 36:04.496
Hey, wait, why are you telling 'em
that we're in our mid-'50s?

36:04.579 --> 36:07.248
Whenever a chick asks me my age,
I always add ten years.

36:07.332 --> 36:08.333
Why do you do that?

36:08.416 --> 36:11.127
You tell them your real age,
they just shrug. No big deal.

36:11.211 --> 36:13.463
Now, you're the fountain of fucking youth.

36:13.546 --> 36:16.758
No wonder that chick stalks you.
Where did you learn to talk like this?

36:16.841 --> 36:18.385
You ever been in a threesome?

36:19.302 --> 36:22.764
I'm not guaranteeing anything, but,
uh, let's try to get that done for you.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.641
Are you shitting me?

36:32.899 --> 36:34.651
You gotta stop staring at me.

36:34.734 --> 36:36.319
Oh, sorry.

36:38.947 --> 36:42.492
You're still staring at me, man.
That's poor three-way etiquette.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.953
All right, Jorge.
Come on, rookie mistake.

36:45.036 --> 36:47.664
Why don't you let the doctor
get a turn in the cockpit, huh?

36:47.747 --> 36:49.124
Rotate for a minute.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.000
Okay, I'm cool.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.170
I'm gonna go take a dookie.
I'll be back in two. Got it?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.923
I'll just... I'm gonna...
I'm gonna chill here.

36:57.006 --> 37:01.386
Taking notes?
Good man.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.804
Hey, Dr. Ron, you know what?

37:02.887 --> 37:04.097
Let me hop in the saddle.

37:04.180 --> 37:06.349
My fuckin' arthritis
in my knees is killin' me.

37:06.433 --> 37:08.226
- Oh, okay. That's fine.
- Yeah, okay.

37:09.018 --> 37:11.479
This is not what
I had in mind when you said threesome!

37:11.563 --> 37:13.898
It's not my fault Joan passed out.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.400
But why shooter boy?

37:15.483 --> 37:17.485
I don't know, you're the one
who loves staring at him.

37:17.569 --> 37:18.570
Hey, Dawn.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.321
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

37:20.405 --> 37:22.449
The, uh, mover guys...

37:22.532 --> 37:25.326
did they happen to give you
any information about us?

37:25.410 --> 37:26.870
No.

37:26.953 --> 37:28.997
But I play tennis
with your real estate lady

37:29.080 --> 37:30.582
and she told me something.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.042
But she said not to repeat it to anyone.

37:33.126 --> 37:36.004
Oh, well, we're all getting close
here tonight, come on.

37:36.755 --> 37:40.842
Well, she said that the buyers, you guys,
seemed to be in an awful hurry.

37:40.925 --> 37:43.261
Like, maybe you were
on the run or somethin'.

37:43.344 --> 37:44.554
"On the run"?

37:44.637 --> 37:46.931
You bad boys.

37:49.350 --> 37:51.770
- Oh! Oh, that's wonderful.
- Uh-huh.

37:51.853 --> 37:54.230
- Oh, thank you.
- Ah...

37:54.314 --> 37:57.066
You're welcome.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.196
Snake delivery!

38:02.238 --> 38:03.490
This the right address?

38:04.491 --> 38:06.826
Oh, shit.
Who ordered that?

38:08.661 --> 38:11.039
All right, Charlie.
Enjoy the view.

38:11.122 --> 38:15.126
Yo, what's up with the AC?
I'm fuckin' sweating my balls off in here.

38:15.752 --> 38:17.587
I'm sorry.

38:21.549 --> 38:24.052
Oh! There's the sex machine.

38:24.761 --> 38:26.054
Morning.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.889
You must be hungry.

38:30.350 --> 38:32.018
One or two sausages?

38:33.311 --> 38:35.980
- One.
- Just the one. Okay.

38:37.982 --> 38:39.542
Would it be better if there were two...

38:39.567 --> 38:41.194
sweaty eggs underneath it?

38:41.277 --> 38:43.488
Come on.

38:43.571 --> 38:46.950
I gotta say, bud. You like it.
Right here, I'll just...

38:52.038 --> 38:53.039
Can I get some food?

38:53.122 --> 38:54.749
Last one...

38:56.876 --> 39:00.547
Gotta be happy, though.
The tongue ring, Dawn dug it.

39:00.630 --> 39:01.756
So did Jorge.

39:01.840 --> 39:04.175
Can we not talk about last night again?
Ever?

39:04.259 --> 39:05.301
All right.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.136
Everything was in balance, though, man.

39:07.220 --> 39:09.681
Dawn says that her husband
cheats on her all the time.

39:09.764 --> 39:12.225
- Wait, she's married?
- Yeah, she's married.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.853
Who do you think we're playing
golf with on Sunday?

39:14.936 --> 39:17.522
Are you fucking with me?

39:17.605 --> 39:19.148
No, we're playing golf with the guy.
I just...

39:19.232 --> 39:21.776
That face you just made
reminded me of last night with the dick,

39:21.860 --> 39:23.319
when it came out, you were like...

39:23.403 --> 39:25.530
By the way,
I think that snake was a cobra,

39:25.613 --> 39:27.740
because it had a hood and a flat head.

39:27.824 --> 39:29.242
It was so gross.

39:30.577 --> 39:32.036
You let that happen.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.622
I gotta sit down.
I'm dizzy.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.626
You don't feel good.
What do you got, a hangover?

39:36.666 --> 39:39.711
Yes, the king is fucking hungover.

39:41.629 --> 39:42.630
Wow.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.467
Look at this.
You see that?

39:46.551 --> 39:48.261
Butch has a picture with Dr. Fishman.

39:48.344 --> 39:49.387
They knew each other.

39:49.470 --> 39:52.473
Yeah, they got brought in together,
I assumed they were friends.

39:52.557 --> 39:54.058
Well, who's the girl?
Is that Dakota?

39:54.142 --> 39:56.269
No, Dakota's my dead guy's chick.

39:56.352 --> 39:57.854
That's yours, buddy.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.523
Your girlfriend or, uh...
look at the ring.

40:00.607 --> 40:02.275
Your wife.

40:02.358 --> 40:05.194
I'm married!
She's a babe.

40:05.278 --> 40:08.406
Yeah, look at you
fallin' in love all over again.

40:08.489 --> 40:10.241
Forgot about Jorge, did you?

40:16.789 --> 40:19.125
Whoo!

40:28.217 --> 40:29.427
Fuck.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.398
Hey!

40:42.482 --> 40:45.068
We got an underwater doorbell!

40:45.151 --> 40:46.819
Butch Ryder knew how to live!

40:46.903 --> 40:48.112
Fuck yeah, man.

40:48.196 --> 40:51.824
All right, you swim.
It's probably Dawn, ready for round two.

40:51.908 --> 40:54.202
Is that what the bell means, round two?

41:10.885 --> 41:12.804
What the fuck is this?

41:17.266 --> 41:18.309
Cheese...

41:19.811 --> 41:20.853
lettuce...

41:22.063 --> 41:23.648
Ah... No! Mustard.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.819
Not too much.

41:28.903 --> 41:30.071
Ooh!

41:31.155 --> 41:33.866
Hey! I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Fishman!

41:33.950 --> 41:35.618
What? Well, who are you?

41:35.702 --> 41:38.913
You know who the fuck I am!
And you know what you did!

41:38.997 --> 41:40.206
No, I don't.

41:40.289 --> 41:42.875
You tag-teamed my wife!

41:42.959 --> 41:46.671
Yeah, she told me all about your...
your little snake delivery!

41:46.754 --> 41:48.006
My snake delivery?

41:48.089 --> 41:50.383
That wasn't me!
That was Jorge, the shooter boy!

41:50.466 --> 41:52.427
- Get the fuck out of the pool. Get out!
- No, I can't.

41:52.510 --> 41:54.679
- Get out of the fucking pool!
- It's not a good idea.

41:54.762 --> 41:56.139
You're not gonna come out?

41:56.222 --> 41:57.932
I'll come in there and break
your fucking skull.

41:58.016 --> 41:59.100
No! No, listen.

41:59.183 --> 42:01.269
Let's talk about this.
Let's have a beer together.

42:02.687 --> 42:03.730
What the...

42:07.191 --> 42:08.443
What the...

42:18.619 --> 42:19.704
Ow!

42:31.299 --> 42:33.301
And that's where the shit
really hit the fan.

42:33.384 --> 42:36.804
I was about to die for real
and I was not ready for that.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.766
Luckily, my friend Max was keeping
another secret from me...

42:41.601 --> 42:43.311
Daddy's got you.

42:43.394 --> 42:46.439
He was Action fucking Jackson.

43:05.750 --> 43:08.669
Aren't you a little fucking tall
for gymnastics?

43:15.176 --> 43:18.221
- Oh!
- Let's go. Run, Ron! Ron, run!

43:18.304 --> 43:19.624
- Come on. Go. You're Ron.
- Yeah.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.372
Yeah, our friend at the bank was correct.

43:44.455 --> 43:47.708
Ryder and Fishman have
returned from the dead.

43:47.792 --> 43:51.546
These two gentlemen have
taken over their identities.

43:56.300 --> 44:00.388
Out of all the dead bodies in the world...
you pick the most wanted man in America?

44:01.973 --> 44:03.099
Stop swiping!

44:04.392 --> 44:05.977
How could you not have
researched these guys?

44:06.060 --> 44:07.353
I researched them.

44:07.436 --> 44:11.858
Dr. Ron's a very successful doctor
with an impeccable record,

44:11.941 --> 44:14.193
who, unfortunately,
got two bullets to the head.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.154
You said he died of natural causes!

44:16.237 --> 44:18.739
You naturally die
if you get two bullets to the head!

44:18.823 --> 44:20.324
Maybe I'm not good with words.

44:20.408 --> 44:23.661
Who the hell are you, man?
And don't lie to me again!

44:23.744 --> 44:25.496
Okay, stop freaking out.

44:25.580 --> 44:28.249
You're right, I'm not a coroner.

44:28.916 --> 44:29.917
I'm a fucking...

44:30.835 --> 44:32.587
guidance counselor.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.088
Shut the fuck up.

44:34.172 --> 44:37.300
How could a guidance counselor
take on trained assassins?

44:37.383 --> 44:39.010
I went to police academy.

44:39.093 --> 44:42.471
I wanted to be a motorcycle cop.
I took it very serious.

44:42.555 --> 44:44.974
I was number one in the class
in marksmanship.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.097
Then why aren't you a cop?

44:46.142 --> 44:49.187
- 'Cause I couldn't pop a fucking wheelie.
- You couldn't pop a wheelie?

44:49.270 --> 44:52.356
And I didn't fare too well
on the psychological exam.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.902
That I believe. Wow.

44:55.985 --> 44:58.070
Now, where did you get these dead bodies?

44:58.154 --> 45:00.406
I found them dead.

45:00.489 --> 45:03.367
They were... gone.
I didn't kill 'em.

45:03.451 --> 45:05.870
And you never thought, for once,
that maybe their family,

45:05.953 --> 45:07.747
maybe their friends, a cop,

45:07.830 --> 45:10.958
a ten-foot-tall assassin
might come lookin' for 'em?

45:11.042 --> 45:14.795
No... but I guess that's why
I should've come clean before.

45:14.879 --> 45:18.549
You always think shit through
better than I do.

45:19.634 --> 45:21.427
What's our next move?
What do we do now?

45:21.510 --> 45:23.888
What do we do? That's easy.
We turn ourselves in.

45:23.971 --> 45:25.806
Okay.
I want to do that, too.

45:25.890 --> 45:28.476
We're looking at 25 to 30 years,
but I can handle that.

45:28.559 --> 45:30.853
No! No, you said it was five to ten.

45:30.937 --> 45:34.523
That was before we stole all that money.
And we shot Dawn's husband.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.108
You shot Dawn's husband!

45:36.192 --> 45:38.611
I only shot him
because you tag-teamed his wife,

45:38.694 --> 45:39.987
you fucking degenerate.

45:40.071 --> 45:42.865
What do you think a Puerto Rican jury
is gonna say about that?

45:42.949 --> 45:45.034
Oh, my God, we're screwed.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.536
- God, I'm an idiot.
- No, no, no, no, no.

45:47.620 --> 45:49.413
- We can get out of this.
- I'm so stupid.

45:49.497 --> 45:53.459
All we gotta do is find out why these guys
wanna kill us and then we'll stop 'em.

45:53.542 --> 45:56.045
They're involved with somethin'
fuckin' shady, right?

45:56.128 --> 45:58.798
The mob or drugs or some shit,
I don't know.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.466
- Yeah.
- You know who would know?

46:00.549 --> 46:01.550
Who would know?

46:02.593 --> 46:05.137
Dr. Ronald Fishman's wife...

46:05.221 --> 46:08.057
who happens to be pretty hot, by the way.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.352
So we decided to go back
to the States to talk to Mrs. Fishman.

46:11.435 --> 46:15.856
As suicidal as it seemed to follow Max,
it was my only option.

46:15.940 --> 46:18.234
And with no place to live
and no way to get around,

46:18.317 --> 46:20.236
we found a way to combine the two.

46:24.657 --> 46:26.325
We found the house easy enough

46:26.409 --> 46:28.411
but we couldn't just go up
and knock on the door.

46:28.494 --> 46:31.330
Our meeting with Mrs. Fishman
had to seem accidental.

46:37.044 --> 46:40.006
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you like that, do you?

46:41.007 --> 46:42.049
I know you like that.

46:42.133 --> 46:45.094
'Cause you're my dirty,

46:45.177 --> 46:47.513
crazy, sweet girl.

46:47.596 --> 46:49.306
- Max?
- Oh!

46:50.474 --> 46:51.809
What's up?

46:52.309 --> 46:53.436
What are you doing?

46:53.519 --> 46:55.438
What was I doing?

46:55.563 --> 46:58.983
I, uh... was having some fun,
I guess, you know.

46:59.066 --> 47:01.569
We all didn't get to play
Three Amigos the other night.

47:01.652 --> 47:03.738
So, I was just looking for some relief.

47:05.156 --> 47:07.324
You... Who were you talking to?

47:07.408 --> 47:11.370
I was talking to a 1-800 number, uh,
"Dial-a-boner."

47:11.454 --> 47:14.415
A girl talks dirty to you
while you fuck a doll.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.251
It's five bucks a minute.
Good to be back in the States.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.337
You say that like it's so normal.

47:21.756 --> 47:23.090
Oh, there she is.
There she is.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.300
Oh, shit.

47:27.928 --> 47:28.929
Yeah.

47:29.013 --> 47:31.474
Well, doc,
your wife has a very nice body.

47:31.557 --> 47:32.975
What's the plan?

47:33.059 --> 47:34.699
- Follow her. Just follow her.
- What? Yeah?

47:34.769 --> 47:36.270
You can do this.
You can do this.

47:36.979 --> 47:39.315
Go, go, go.
Don't let her get too far away.

47:48.741 --> 47:50.034
What the fuck?

47:50.117 --> 47:52.203
Oh, my God!

47:52.286 --> 47:54.997
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
Are you all right?

47:55.081 --> 47:57.041
Jesus, what the hell were you thinking?

47:57.124 --> 47:59.210
That's why I bought you a phone book!

47:59.293 --> 48:01.587
So you could see
over the fucking steering wheel!

48:01.670 --> 48:03.214
Sit on it next time!

48:03.297 --> 48:05.257
It's okay, sweetheart.
I'm an EMT.

48:05.341 --> 48:08.135
Let me just make sure you're all right,
check your head.

48:08.219 --> 48:09.720
What's your name, dear?

48:09.804 --> 48:11.013
Heather Fishman.

48:11.097 --> 48:13.641
And how many asshole drivers
can you see right now?

48:14.391 --> 48:17.019
- One.
- Right on the money. Good.

48:17.103 --> 48:19.021
So, can we get you back to your house?

48:19.105 --> 48:20.731
- Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.
- Yeah.

48:20.815 --> 48:21.899
Oh!

48:21.982 --> 48:23.484
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

48:23.567 --> 48:26.570
I just wanna say,
even though I'm friends with him,

48:26.654 --> 48:30.241
if you choose to sue him,
I will testify on your behalf.

48:30.324 --> 48:31.408
Not a problem.

48:31.492 --> 48:34.120
Aw, that's sweet of you,
but I don't think that'll be necessary.

48:34.203 --> 48:35.704
- I'm pretty sure it's just a bruise.
- Yeah?

48:35.788 --> 48:37.206
- Yeah.
- How about the ice?

48:37.289 --> 48:38.415
- Let's get the ice.
- I know. I got it.

48:38.499 --> 48:40.751
- Oh, you found the kitchen. Okay.
- Yeah, that's right.

48:40.835 --> 48:42.419
All right, here you go.
I'm gonna...

48:42.503 --> 48:43.838
- I'll put it right there.
- Okay.

48:43.921 --> 48:45.798
I think if you elevate it
above your heart,

48:45.881 --> 48:47.716
that's what's supposed to be good for it.

48:47.800 --> 48:49.426
It's actually my other knee.

48:49.510 --> 48:53.222
Okay, all right. So, lift that up.
And I'll put the ice like this.

48:53.305 --> 48:54.974
What are you doing right now?

48:55.057 --> 48:57.101
- Oh, my God! I'm so sorry!
- Ow!

48:57.184 --> 48:58.310
I'm sorry, I didn't...

48:58.394 --> 49:00.312
- It's fine.
- Here. Here. Okay.

49:00.396 --> 49:03.607
Don't be mad at him, he gets nervous
every time he likes somebody.

49:03.691 --> 49:05.151
Whoops, did I say that?

49:06.777 --> 49:08.737
Oh, you want us to get that for you?

49:08.821 --> 49:11.407
- Oh, no, that's okay, I can handle it.
- But your knee...

49:11.490 --> 49:12.741
You guys can leave, I'm fine.

49:12.825 --> 49:14.451
- Honestly, guys, you can leave.
- Sure.

49:14.535 --> 49:15.536
What do we do?

49:26.213 --> 49:27.840
Mrs. Fishman, I'm so sorry.

49:27.923 --> 49:29.341
I'm gonna have to get you out of here.

49:29.425 --> 49:30.426
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

49:34.513 --> 49:35.723
Whoa, whoa. Mrs. Fishman!

49:35.806 --> 49:37.057
Wait! Wait! Wait! Please!

49:37.141 --> 49:38.934
We're here to help you,
not hurt you, I promise.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.061
We got off on the wrong foot.
My name is Charlie.

49:43.397 --> 49:44.899
What the fuck?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.902
Please, let me go!

50:00.039 --> 50:01.123
Let me out!

50:01.207 --> 50:02.291
- Let me out!
- Heather!

50:02.374 --> 50:04.126
- Let me out!
- Calm down!

50:04.210 --> 50:06.253
Calm down, we're the good guys,
I promise you.

50:06.337 --> 50:07.755
- You have to trust us. Please.
- "Trust you"?

50:07.838 --> 50:09.965
You kidnap me, and you hit me
with a Winnebago...

50:10.049 --> 50:11.175
We did that for a reason!

50:11.258 --> 50:13.636
- "A reason"?
- Listen to me, I have proof.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.012
- We are not lying.
- You better show me proof!

50:15.095 --> 50:17.306
Mrs. Fishman, this is your husband.

50:18.641 --> 50:20.768
- Oh, my God!
- What are you doing?

50:20.851 --> 50:21.977
She wanted proof!

50:22.061 --> 50:24.855
A dead, naked picture of him
makes us look like the bad guys.

50:24.939 --> 50:26.023
- Hey, I don't know.
- Don't you think?

50:26.106 --> 50:28.025
Can you please pull over?
I can't breathe.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.308
- It's so hot in here.
- I'll pull over! I'll pull over!

50:32.029 --> 50:33.197
- She's upset.
- Yeah.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.115
She's upset.

50:35.199 --> 50:38.202
Do you think we could run to the doctor
for two seconds, I just feel like this...

50:38.285 --> 50:40.955
We don't got time, buddy.
Just get over that.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.748
So Ronnie's really gone?

50:43.540 --> 50:45.918
Uh... yeah, I'm afraid so.

50:46.001 --> 50:47.461
I have been looking for him.

50:47.544 --> 50:50.422
I kept praying that he was safe, but...

50:50.506 --> 50:52.508
deep down,
I knew something bad had happened.

50:52.591 --> 50:55.344
We are so sorry for your loss.

50:55.427 --> 50:58.764
If it's any consolation,
your husband went quickly and peacefully.

50:58.847 --> 51:00.849
Just...

51:00.933 --> 51:02.101
two shots to the skull,

51:02.184 --> 51:04.561
- right through there, then...
- out the end.

51:04.645 --> 51:05.646
Oh, my God!

51:05.729 --> 51:07.731
What he says is...

51:07.815 --> 51:11.652
He's saying that we're very sorry,
but we also have one more problem.

51:11.735 --> 51:14.738
You see, there are some people out there
that think I'm your husband,

51:14.822 --> 51:16.615
- and they're trying to kill me.
- Right.

51:16.699 --> 51:18.158
Why do they think you're Ronnie?

51:18.242 --> 51:21.578
Well, he stole your husband's ID
and started impersonating him.

51:21.662 --> 51:24.290
He's also wearing his clothes
like a fucking weirdo.

51:24.373 --> 51:27.126
We figure the same people
that are trying to kill us...

51:27.209 --> 51:28.377
are the ones who shot your husband.

51:28.460 --> 51:30.754
"Us"? And who are you pretending to be?

51:30.838 --> 51:32.798
The legendary Butch Ryder.

51:32.881 --> 51:34.425
Butch Ryder?

51:34.508 --> 51:35.968
- You know him?
- Yeah.

51:36.051 --> 51:37.136
Yeah.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.848
We found pictures of you and your husband
on Butch's tablet.

51:40.931 --> 51:43.100
Was he a patient of his or something?

51:43.183 --> 51:47.730
No, Ronnie didn't practice anymore.
He ran a pharmaceutical research firm.

51:47.855 --> 51:50.733
Butch was his friend.
They used to ride motorcycles together.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.860
He... he said he was a fun guy.

51:52.943 --> 51:56.488
Fun enough to land himself on the FBI's
Most Wanted list.

51:56.572 --> 51:57.656
- What?
- Yeah.

51:57.740 --> 52:00.617
- Oh, my God.
- Both of their bodies were found together.

52:00.701 --> 52:04.371
We think maybe Butch got your husband
tangled into some trouble.

52:05.331 --> 52:09.168
Well, I guess that would make sense
why our house was broken into last week.

52:09.251 --> 52:10.836
Did they take anything?

52:10.919 --> 52:13.839
Oh, that was the weird part,
they just tore apart Ronnie's study.

52:15.007 --> 52:16.800
I bet they were looking for something.

52:16.884 --> 52:18.677
Astonishing work there, Nancy Drew.

52:18.761 --> 52:22.514
Anyways, did he ever come to your house?
Did he possibly hide something there?

52:22.598 --> 52:23.640
No.

52:23.724 --> 52:25.934
Ronnie would always meet him
at some biker bar,

52:26.060 --> 52:28.395
this place, um, off of Route 80.

52:28.479 --> 52:29.813
Bing-bang, let's roll.

52:29.897 --> 52:32.524
- Okay. Hey, come on. Come with us.
- I'm going there?

52:45.788 --> 52:48.040
I can't believe
Ronnie used to come to this place.

52:48.123 --> 52:49.124
Yes, shocking.

52:49.208 --> 52:51.210
So, you gonna make a move on that,
or am I gonna do it?

52:51.293 --> 52:53.921
Jeez, her husband just died.
She's mourning, for Christ's sake.

52:54.004 --> 52:56.673
Yeah, then she needs
a nice dick to cry on.

53:01.720 --> 53:02.888
Hey... Encino Man, how are you?

53:02.971 --> 53:06.433
I was wondering if you happen
to know a badass...

53:07.434 --> 53:09.520
by the name of Butch Ryder?

53:10.312 --> 53:13.565
Yeah, I know Butch, and I'll tell you
the same thing I told the cops,

53:13.649 --> 53:15.067
I ain't seen him in months.

53:15.150 --> 53:17.403
Now, order some drinks or get out.

53:19.321 --> 53:20.572
Three Jamesons.

53:22.074 --> 53:24.743
Hope you're proud of yourself,
killing that tiny elephant

53:24.827 --> 53:27.371
and putting his tusk in your nose.
Real tough.

53:28.997 --> 53:30.457
Here's to new friends.

53:31.333 --> 53:33.585
- To Ronnie.
- Yeah. Yeah, him, too.

53:36.213 --> 53:38.298
Good God.
Jameson, man.

53:38.382 --> 53:40.717
Every time,
it reminds me of my 55th birthday party.

53:40.801 --> 53:43.220
Remember that night?
Wasn't that the best?

53:43.303 --> 53:45.681
- Come on. You're 55?
- Can you believe that?

53:45.764 --> 53:50.853
I'm actually gonna be 57 next week.
Where does time go?

53:50.936 --> 53:53.439
Wow, you look amazing.

53:53.522 --> 53:55.065
Well, I eat a lot of fruit.

53:56.024 --> 53:57.484
Peaches are my favorite.

53:57.568 --> 54:01.029
I can eat a peach for about two,
three hours.

54:01.113 --> 54:03.115
Mmm...

54:03.198 --> 54:06.410
You think he's old... I'm 66.

54:06.493 --> 54:08.412
Yeah, I can see that.

54:09.413 --> 54:11.331
- Seventy?
- Hey.

54:11.415 --> 54:13.959
It's not The Price Is Right.
We'll be right back.

54:14.042 --> 54:15.711
Gonna talk to him for a sec.

54:16.211 --> 54:17.379
What the hell are you doing?

54:17.963 --> 54:19.423
Chicks don't wanna fuck senior citizens.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.717
Senior citizens don't wanna
fuck senior citizens.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.636
Look at her, she's so far
out of my league, I can't think.

54:24.720 --> 54:27.681
But she's grieving,
which makes her vulnerable,

54:27.764 --> 54:29.099
which means you have a shot.

54:29.183 --> 54:32.603
Now, first time you feel like
there's a moment, seize it.

54:32.686 --> 54:33.896
Look her in the eyes,

54:33.979 --> 54:36.106
grab the back of her neck,

54:36.190 --> 54:37.941
say nothing...

54:38.025 --> 54:40.652
and then fuck her in the mouth
with your tongue.

54:41.236 --> 54:42.946
- You're a psycho.
- Fuck you.

54:43.030 --> 54:45.532
So Benjamin Button here is gonna
buy you another drink.

54:45.616 --> 54:48.076
I'm gonna go look for a canary
and make him sing.

54:50.537 --> 54:53.582
Hey, Bamm-Bamm,
can we get two more, man?

54:55.292 --> 54:56.585
All right.

54:56.668 --> 54:58.962
Let's look at your hand, Grandpa.

54:59.046 --> 55:01.089
I used to be a nurse.
That's how I met Ronnie.

55:01.173 --> 55:04.551
What's the prognosis?
You think you can... save it?

55:04.635 --> 55:05.636
Let's see.

55:06.970 --> 55:09.473
- To numbing the pain?
- Sure.

55:14.269 --> 55:16.480
That is for hitting me with the Winnebago.

55:19.441 --> 55:22.194
Hey, gentlemen?
Anybody using this chair?

55:22.277 --> 55:24.112
- It's yours.
- Thanks.

55:27.157 --> 55:28.867
What kind of hogs you riding nowadays?

55:28.951 --> 55:32.120
I've still got my...
Whoa!

55:32.204 --> 55:34.790
Where the hell is Butch?
What did you do with him?

55:34.873 --> 55:37.709
He's at the bottom of the ocean.
Let me show you a picture.

55:37.793 --> 55:39.628
- You killed him!
- No, no, no! He didn't kill him!

55:39.711 --> 55:41.380
We're trying to find the guys who did.

55:41.463 --> 55:45.884
Then why is this sick bastard
wearing Butch's tats and jewelry?

55:45.968 --> 55:47.886
Because he's a sick bastard,
but he's telling you the truth.

55:47.970 --> 55:50.610
He didn't kill Butch and he didn't
kill my husband, Ronnie, either.

55:51.348 --> 55:52.599
You're Mrs. Fishman?

55:52.683 --> 55:53.809
Yes.

55:54.935 --> 55:55.978
Fuck!

55:57.062 --> 55:59.648
Butch was diagnosed
with stage-four cancer.

55:59.731 --> 56:01.775
He was given six months to live.

56:02.734 --> 56:04.236
So that's how they met.

56:04.319 --> 56:06.947
Ronnie was working
on some promising cancer treatments.

56:07.030 --> 56:08.490
More than promising.

56:08.574 --> 56:11.410
Butch told me Ronnie developed
a magic bullet.

56:11.493 --> 56:13.662
It was a treatment
that used an MRI machine

56:13.745 --> 56:17.082
to target the bad cells
and not kill the good ones.

56:17.165 --> 56:19.084
I had no idea they had gotten that far.

56:19.167 --> 56:23.714
Well, they were conducting some secret,
non-FDA approved clinical trials.

56:23.797 --> 56:26.049
Butch and some other guys
were the guinea pigs.

56:26.133 --> 56:29.094
- And it was working?
- Bet your ass it was working.

56:29.177 --> 56:32.347
Guys were getting better,
no fucking side effects.

56:32.431 --> 56:35.350
When Ronnie had to shut down the program,
they both were devastated.

56:35.434 --> 56:36.434
Which leads me to ask,

56:36.476 --> 56:39.771
why the fuck would they close down
a program that was working?

56:39.855 --> 56:44.860
Money. Ronnie's partner, Shecky,
Arthur Sheck, he was the money guy.

56:44.943 --> 56:47.063
He called up one day,
suddenly the funds had dried up,

56:47.112 --> 56:49.406
and they had to cancel
all these research programs.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.576
- That must have been one of 'em.
- Yes, ma'am, it was.

56:52.659 --> 56:55.912
Until Butch and your husband
took matters into their own hands.

56:55.996 --> 56:58.915
- What does that mean?
- It means Butch started knocking off banks

56:58.999 --> 57:01.126
to have enough money
to continue the treatments.

57:01.209 --> 57:02.294
Holy shit.

57:02.377 --> 57:06.381
When he got that pretty little face of his
on the FBI's Most Wanted List...

57:06.465 --> 57:11.678
they sent me down to Puerto Rico
to set up their secret hideaway.

57:11.762 --> 57:14.765
But I guess they... never made it there.

57:15.724 --> 57:16.892
Wait a minute.

57:17.809 --> 57:18.977
You're Dakota?

57:19.061 --> 57:20.729
Yeah.

57:20.812 --> 57:23.065
"Dakota sounds hot."

57:23.148 --> 57:24.316
Oh, fuck you.

57:24.399 --> 57:26.568
Sounds like you and Butch
were pretty close.

57:26.652 --> 57:30.739
He knew me like no other man
had ever known me before.

57:30.822 --> 57:33.241
Tough, but tender.

57:33.325 --> 57:34.743
What's this now?

57:36.244 --> 57:38.622
We were fuck buddies for years.

57:38.705 --> 57:42.542
Until Dr. Ronnie came along
and stole his heart away.

57:42.626 --> 57:44.086
No disrespect.

57:45.712 --> 57:47.714
Oh, shit, you didn't know?

57:48.882 --> 57:53.178
Oh, sugar... I am so, so sorry.

57:54.137 --> 57:56.264
- This explains a lot.
- The thing is,

57:56.348 --> 57:58.350
Dr. Ronnie and Butch were killed

57:58.433 --> 58:00.894
not because they were
in love with each other,

58:00.978 --> 58:04.815
or knockin' off banks...
because they were trying to cure cancer.

58:06.108 --> 58:08.318
Which is fucking disgraceful.

58:08.860 --> 58:11.154
This gets me so goddamn upset.

58:13.740 --> 58:16.785
That brings back some nice memories.

58:20.080 --> 58:22.290
You know, I gotta give you credit.

58:22.374 --> 58:25.002
You rock that jewelry real well.

58:25.085 --> 58:28.130
You know, that's how we met.
I'm a jewelry designer.

58:28.213 --> 58:31.299
- Oh.
- And Butch, that boy loved his bling.

58:31.383 --> 58:32.426
Oh, yeah?

58:32.509 --> 58:36.221
Did you make Dr. Ronald's
tongue ring, too?

58:36.304 --> 58:37.597
I like it, it's fun.

58:37.681 --> 58:39.808
Yeah, that's one of mine.

58:39.891 --> 58:42.310
But... that ain't a tongue ring.

58:42.394 --> 58:43.603
That's a cock stud.

58:43.687 --> 58:46.606
What? What?

58:48.608 --> 58:51.153
I can't believe you let me put
a cock stud in my mouth!

58:51.236 --> 58:53.697
I can't believe my husband had
a cock stud in his cock.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.115
Yeah, that's worse.
Come on, that's worse.

58:55.198 --> 58:56.491
Don't be a baby.

58:57.451 --> 58:58.660
- And Max...
- Yeah.

58:58.744 --> 59:03.331
If you need some place to lay low...
you can always shack up with me, baby boy.

59:03.415 --> 59:06.001
Yeah, that's very sweet of you, Dakota.

59:06.084 --> 59:09.588
I just don't know how safe
that would be for me or you.

59:12.382 --> 59:17.012
I know you wanna kiss me...
but I'm not your Butch.

59:17.095 --> 59:18.638
I'll never be Butch.

59:18.722 --> 59:23.351
What I can do is give you a mental image
to go enjoy yourself later with.

59:28.690 --> 59:30.567
You're a bad boy.

59:31.610 --> 59:34.237
Oh, choke on it, baby, choke me.

59:34.321 --> 59:36.114
Is this your friend?

59:38.241 --> 59:41.286
Ooh... Oh, yeah.

59:43.622 --> 59:45.916
Did he just cum in his pants?

59:50.087 --> 59:51.171
The Gymnast.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.298
No!

59:58.303 --> 01:00:00.597
- What are you doing? Go that way!
- Donuts!

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:04.226
Where am I?

01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:06.144
You cannot find me?

01:00:08.647 --> 01:00:11.858
I ain't afraid of you,
I ain't afraid of fucking nothing!

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.909
You don't kill me. I kill you.

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:33.505
And the Russian judges give that
a what-the-fuck-just-happened-there?

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.633
I can't believe that guy found us!

01:00:36.716 --> 01:00:38.260
What do we do?
We gotta hide out somewhere.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.095
My mother's summer cottage.

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:41.418
- Your mother's cottage?
- Yeah.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:42.639
You don't wanna drag her into all this.

01:00:42.722 --> 01:00:44.808
It's all right.
She's senile as hell now.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:47.018
She sat on the toilet
the other day for six hours

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.312
thinking she was on a bus to Disney World.

01:00:49.396 --> 01:00:52.774
They could torture the shit out of her.
She wouldn't cough up a word.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:05.245
Not many houses on this island.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.956
Oh, yeah, we're secluded.
No one's gonna find us here.

01:01:08.039 --> 01:01:09.166
Hey, check this out.

01:01:09.249 --> 01:01:12.210
- That old YZinger? You have that still?
- Yeah!

01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:13.920
You were a mad man on that.

01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.840
I could never pop a wheelie,
but guess who got me that thing?

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.176
- Who?
- Your dad.

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:21.928
- My dad?
- Your dad, after my father died.

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:24.890
He did stuff like that all the time
for me, I'll never forget that.

01:01:24.973 --> 01:01:26.975
Just looked out for me
when I was growing up.

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:28.226
Sounds like a good man.

01:01:28.310 --> 01:01:29.394
- The best.
- If he's such a good man,

01:01:29.477 --> 01:01:30.604
why didn't he give me one?

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.063
Well, look at you.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:35.567
You were good at reading.
Just stick with that. Come on.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:37.527
"Look at you."
That's the only answer you have.

01:01:38.195 --> 01:01:40.280
My mother is gonna be psyched to see you.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.240
How senile is your mom?
Will she remember me?

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:44.044
Of course,
she talks about you all the time.

01:01:44.326 --> 01:01:45.535
- Oh!
- Mom!

01:01:45.619 --> 01:01:47.120
Mom! What are you doing?

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:49.039
The fridge! The fridge!

01:01:49.122 --> 01:01:53.293
Come on, the pizza guy, the president,
the mailman, the gardener, the me!

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:57.380
I called you on the phone, remember?
That's why you set dinner up for us.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:02:01.009
Oh!
Max!

01:02:01.092 --> 01:02:02.219
Ah, there you go.
Oh, a jump.

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:04.679
I love you.

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.139
Look who's here.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.143
Sonny Bono and Donna Summer!

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:14.231
What hurt more?
The frying pan or the Sonny Bono thing?

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:17.108
It's all pretty bad today.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:21.321
I still can't believe it.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:25.158
My Maxi's best friend,
little Charlie McMillan.

01:02:25.242 --> 01:02:29.537
You know, after all these years,
he never stopped talking about you.

01:02:29.621 --> 01:02:31.748
- How you're so successful.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:36.711
Became the big branch manager
of Save & Pay Supermarkets.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:39.339
You got a good memory, Mom.

01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:44.010
I hear you married the prom queen.
What was that whore's name again?

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.304
Uh, Nikki.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:48.306
And we're not married anymore,
Mrs. Kessler.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:49.766
She wasn't very nice to me.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:54.729
Good, I hope you didn't catch
any sores from her filthy...

01:02:54.813 --> 01:02:56.439
you know...

01:02:56.523 --> 01:02:57.607
vagina.

01:02:57.691 --> 01:02:59.442
Oh...

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.736
No, there was none of...
That wasn't the reason.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:05.657
Hey, who's that cute kid on the fridge?

01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:10.245
Little Maxi. Isn't he gorgeous?
He's coming to see me next week.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:15.667
What the hell are you talking about?
Visit you next week? That's me, Ma.

01:03:15.750 --> 01:03:17.794
You're Little Maxi?

01:03:17.877 --> 01:03:19.337
No, I'm Big Maxi!

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.424
You remember the Save & Pay job,
but you don't remember I grew up?

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:26.511
Uh... I remember you loved
that little Jimmie Walker T-shirt.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:29.431
See, I love how he remembers
this stuff and... and you...

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:34.185
I just wish you showed up at my funeral.
Maybe, uh, that's what's bothering me.

01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:35.478
You're a ghost?

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:39.566
Oh, I'm so confused.

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:41.776
It's not you, I'm sorry.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:46.072
Don't be upset. I love you.
I know, you're just old... and crazy.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:50.160
Hey, one thing you shouldn't
be confused about...

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:52.078
I don't work at Save & Pay.

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:56.207
I work... I work in the bank inside of...
I'm a bank manager.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.418
Hey, guys, I just got
off the phone with Shecky.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:02.213
He has no idea Ronald's dead.
I didn't have the heart to tell him.

01:04:02.297 --> 01:04:04.215
Or he's pretending he has no idea.

01:04:06.217 --> 01:04:08.428
Everybody be cool.
It's probably just the fuse box.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:09.721
Happens all the time.

01:04:09.804 --> 01:04:11.431
I don't know,
somebody could be out there, Max.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:12.932
Ma, where's my bag?

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:15.018
- I don't remember.
- Yeah, that's a shock.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:17.270
Found it.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.938
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.690
You know, I'm the kind of guy

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.692
who always carries
a rubber in my wallet...

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.612
...and an umbrella in my trunk.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.073
'Cause you never know
when you're gonna fuck in the rain.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:29.282
Max!

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:31.993
Ma, you know you fucked in the rain.
Relax.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:34.204
That's true.
And the snow.

01:04:34.287 --> 01:04:35.914
- Yeah!
- Max, wait.

01:04:35.997 --> 01:04:37.540
You don't know if it's safe out there.

01:04:37.624 --> 01:04:39.125
Yeah? For who?

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.977
Yep, it's the fuse box!

01:05:02.690 --> 01:05:04.859
Holy fuck!

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.865
Stupid, selfish, son of a bitch!

01:05:10.949 --> 01:05:14.786
- Whoa!
- I am so tired of these games!

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:16.329
I know you are!

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:19.165
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:21.126
I can't do it.
You need to come back to me.

01:05:21.209 --> 01:05:23.420
I need you.
You need me.

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:26.089
Oh! Who's this sexy bitch?

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:27.674
I'm his mother.

01:05:27.757 --> 01:05:30.844
Not you, Ma.
Becca, it's not what you think.

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.846
Oh, no, of course not.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:36.933
Because your mother knows
the world of pain that I'm in right now.

01:05:37.016 --> 01:05:39.185
Would you just please
put the gun down so we can talk?

01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:40.270
I can't believe...

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.440
I just cannot believe that this is how
you would want to end everything.

01:05:43.523 --> 01:05:47.986
- I just wanna talk to you.
- Listen, you're sick, Max.

01:05:48.069 --> 01:05:50.655
- You're sick.
- I know, I'm sorry.

01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:52.532
I just don't understand.

01:05:54.367 --> 01:05:56.786
Why wouldn't you want to spend
every last minute with me?

01:05:56.870 --> 01:05:59.914
I'm your family.
I'm your family.

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:01.749
- I know.
- You don't know!

01:06:01.833 --> 01:06:04.961
- All right!
- You have no fucking idea!

01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:06.713
We'll give you guys
some privacy.

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.882
- Get a hold of yourself.
- I'll take this, too.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.759
You gotta just walk away.
Just say goodbye.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:13.636
Just say goodbye.
That's it.

01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:17.515
All right.
Say goodbye to this.

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:20.310
You gotta go! Go!

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:21.644
I'm going!

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:22.812
Then go!

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.981
- Shut the door.
- Get over here. Get over here.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:30.195
They are fucking crazy.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:33.114
Ma! Ma, get the fuck out of here!

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:38.328
It's so fucking hot

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.371
how you tracked me down, woman.

01:06:40.455 --> 01:06:43.625
I would follow you
to the pits of hell, you fucker!

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:47.045
Yeah, well, I'm smelling
your pits as I fuck you silly.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:49.088
Oh, that got me!

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.925
Oh, I'm coming!
Oh, smell my feet.

01:06:55.929 --> 01:06:56.971
Whoo!

01:06:57.055 --> 01:06:59.474
I wish I was senile now.

01:06:59.557 --> 01:07:01.184
Can I ask you a question?

01:07:01.267 --> 01:07:02.435
Yeah, sure.

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:06.231
What was so terrible about your life
that you wanted a whole new one?

01:07:06.314 --> 01:07:07.607
Oh...

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:11.986
Well, for starters,
it kind of wasn't my choice.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.113
I got forced into it.

01:07:14.197 --> 01:07:17.367
But... it is nice to have
another opportunity

01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:19.786
to try to become the person
that I should have been.

01:07:19.869 --> 01:07:21.579
And who's that?

01:07:22.288 --> 01:07:24.374
I haven't figured that part out yet.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:29.045
Well... we should probably
get some shut-eye.

01:07:29.128 --> 01:07:32.465
Uh... why don't you take the bed
and I'll... I'll take the couch.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:36.177
Actually, I would feel much safer
if you slept in here with me.

01:07:37.428 --> 01:07:38.846
Um...

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:40.807
Do you mean share this bed?

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.977
No. I mean, you take the floor,
I take the bed.

01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:46.396
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Of course.

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.147
Oh, Charlie, I'm kidding.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.983
Come on, we're adults.

01:07:50.066 --> 01:07:52.235
I think we can share the bed
for one night.

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:55.071
- Really?
- Okay.

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:02.412
Well, you don't have to worry about me,

01:08:02.495 --> 01:08:05.707
because I stayed in the same bed
with my ex-wife for... four years

01:08:05.790 --> 01:08:08.126
and I don't think we touched toes once.

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.420
You know,
you forget who you're talking to.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:14.340
My husband had a stud in his thingy
and I never even knew.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.425
The truth is,

01:08:15.508 --> 01:08:18.886
I could have a telephone pole through
my dick and she would never have known.

01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:22.724
You're funny, Charlie.

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:24.809
You're a funny, nice guy.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:50.917
Hey, where'd Becca go?

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.171
Oh, I broke up with her again.
She's psychotic.

01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:55.840
How'd it go with you and this chick?
You take my advice?

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:56.966
Yeah, it went okay.

01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:59.801
What? You kidding me?

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:02.971
Dr. Ron's corpse is not even cold yet
and you're fucking his widow?

01:09:03.055 --> 01:09:04.182
Are you an asshole?

01:09:04.265 --> 01:09:06.768
No... No, you said it was okay.
Are you...

01:09:06.850 --> 01:09:08.728
It is okay, I'm fucking with you, brother.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:10.354
Look how happy you made her.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.318
Welcome to Old Willow.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:18.071
- Heather, Heather, Heather.
- Aw! It's so good to see you.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:19.947
Come on in, gentlemen.
Come on.

01:09:20.031 --> 01:09:21.698
I just made some sweet tea.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:28.413
Ronald's dead.
I can't believe it.

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.667
Believe it now, Shecky?

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:32.292
Oh! Oh!

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:35.296
- Max, enough with the pictures.
- He said he didn't believe it.

01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.466
- I believed it. I'm just in disbelief.
- Oh, okay.

01:09:39.550 --> 01:09:42.929
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
It's been an emotional week.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:47.015
I lost my mama on Monday.

01:09:48.059 --> 01:09:52.604
And then I found out
all the medical supplies I donated

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:54.732
to the Burmese drought victims...

01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.609
were stolen by the rebels.

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:01.364
The soup kitchen I volunteer at...
burned down.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:06.953
Whole city smelled like...
ashes and Campbell's Chunky.

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:10.707
Sweet kicks, though.

01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:12.083
- Huh?
- Where'd you get 'em?

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.002
I know a guy at Nike.

01:10:15.086 --> 01:10:17.755
Shit, I wish I had a pair that nice,
but...

01:10:17.839 --> 01:10:19.924
I don't know a guy at Nike.

01:10:20.007 --> 01:10:23.052
Heather, how do you know
these fellas, again?

01:10:23.136 --> 01:10:24.137
They're new friends.

01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:26.055
They're just trying to help me
figure it all out.

01:10:26.139 --> 01:10:28.141
Yeah, Shecky, I mean, do you have
any files we can look at?

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:29.600
Anything that would help us?

01:10:29.684 --> 01:10:33.855
My house got broken into and they stole
my laptop and my cell phone.

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:38.735
So you had a formula that actually works
on cancer and you lost it.

01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:41.112
I never had any formula.
That was Ronald's department.

01:10:41.195 --> 01:10:42.822
I just handled the money.

01:10:42.905 --> 01:10:46.159
You handled it so well
that they couldn't finish the testing.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:49.495
Those drugs were working, Shecky.

01:10:49.579 --> 01:10:51.706
Is this a fucking joke to you?

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:53.583
It wasn't my fault, I swear!

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:55.835
The bank called in all our loans
out of nowhere,

01:10:55.918 --> 01:10:57.003
didn't give us a reason.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:59.046
I went everywhere for financing.
I swear.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:01.132
I even tried to mortgage Old Willow.

01:11:01.215 --> 01:11:03.801
Nobody would sit down with Shecky.
Nobody!

01:11:03.885 --> 01:11:06.846
I hope you don't think
I had something to do with this.

01:11:08.598 --> 01:11:11.893
I felt horrible when I let Ronald down.

01:11:13.186 --> 01:11:15.521
He was my best friend.

01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.609
We should go back there right now,

01:11:19.692 --> 01:11:21.861
torture the fuck out of him
till he tells the truth.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.988
We get it, you don't like the guy,
but here's the good news.

01:11:24.071 --> 01:11:26.073
We know what the guys
with the guns want now.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:27.158
Yeah, the formula.

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:29.327
That's why they must have
broken into my house.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:30.745
Do you think it could be there?

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.413
I don't know, it could be anywhere.

01:11:32.497 --> 01:11:34.957
Clearly, Ronnie was
a master at hiding things.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.460
- I should know.
- Uh-oh.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.129
Jesus!

01:11:40.213 --> 01:11:43.090
This mummy-looking-motherfucker's
like a human tracking device.

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.258
- What do we do?
- You know what?

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.968
Why don't you buckle up there,
Mrs. Fishman?

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.220
Oh, God, no.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:51.682
Hey, dude, I'm lost.

01:11:51.766 --> 01:11:54.435
Can you tell me where
the side of the road is?

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:57.647
Oh, my God.

01:12:05.738 --> 01:12:08.282
Hey, a little dizzy?
Get up.

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:10.993
Come on, get up!

01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:12.161
Who are you?

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:13.412
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:13.496 --> 01:12:15.122
Why are you following me?

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:17.750
Uh... Um... American...

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:19.877
American what?
Pharmaceuticals?

01:12:19.961 --> 01:12:21.796
American Girl doll? What?

01:12:21.879 --> 01:12:25.132
American... Express...

01:12:25.216 --> 01:12:26.759
Fraud Department.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.178
What?

01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:31.597
- You're Max Kessler, right?
- Yeah!

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.517
You owe us $62,000.

01:12:34.600 --> 01:12:37.103
Watch it. Watch it.
Slow.

01:12:39.605 --> 01:12:41.816
Fuck, that's my old address, too.

01:12:41.899 --> 01:12:43.609
You're good.

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.069
This guy's fucking good.

01:12:45.736 --> 01:12:47.113
All right.

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.657
- Come on. I'm sorry, asshole.
- Ow!

01:12:49.740 --> 01:12:51.200
Okay, bub.

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.494
There's 150 grand in here.

01:12:53.578 --> 01:12:55.496
That's over double what I owe Amex.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.790
So just take the rest,
pay for your medical bills.

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:01.294
Fuckin' buy a suit,
maybe a 3D flat screen.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.962
Fuck, take it all, move to Maui.

01:13:03.045 --> 01:13:05.756
You know Hawaiian chicks
love to fuck guys with red beards.

01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.508
I made that up, nobody does.

01:13:09.010 --> 01:13:11.137
Look, we're in
a Rubik's Cube of shit right now,

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.598
and it's up to me to make
all the right moves.

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:17.643
Walking you inside that crowded hospital
ain't one of 'em.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:20.688
So is our business concluded... Robert?

01:13:24.108 --> 01:13:26.944
You're a hell of a bloodhound,
you know that?

01:13:27.028 --> 01:13:29.488
Put some Bactine on that shit,
it'll get better.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:40.583
Oh!

01:13:45.755 --> 01:13:48.925
With nowhere else to go,
we went back to the scene of the crime.

01:13:49.008 --> 01:13:52.219
Maybe Dr. Ron's laboratory
still had some secrets.

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:54.513
These files are all messed up
and out of order.

01:13:54.597 --> 01:13:57.308
Listen, I think I can decode the password
for these encrypted files.

01:13:57.391 --> 01:14:00.102
- You can hack?
- We call it forensic data recovery.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.480
But yeah, at the bank,
when someone defaults,

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.774
we have the legal right to access
their systems and ledgers

01:14:04.857 --> 01:14:06.192
to find any hidden assets.

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:07.568
But they were working under the radar.

01:14:07.652 --> 01:14:10.488
Well, if they have employees,
which it looks like they did,

01:14:10.571 --> 01:14:12.740
I can access it through
the payroll service.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:15.284
That's impressive.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:19.121
Well, in my old life, I did have
a lot of free time on my hands.

01:14:19.205 --> 01:14:20.873
Boom! Check it out.

01:14:20.957 --> 01:14:21.958
Photos of your husband.

01:14:22.041 --> 01:14:24.543
Photos of Butch.
There's my tongue ring... Oh!

01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:25.907
Don't look at that. I'm sorry.

01:14:25.962 --> 01:14:27.630
I shouldn't have said that.
No, no, no.

01:14:27.713 --> 01:14:30.341
Kojak to Columbo.
No suspicious activity out here.

01:14:30.424 --> 01:14:33.052
- Find anything?
- Negative, Kojak, we're still looking.

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.138
Hurry the fuck up, Charlie.
We gotta find that formula.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:38.599
Listen, we're gonna find it,
we're gonna give it to these Nazis,

01:14:38.683 --> 01:14:40.267
and then this nightmare will be over.

01:14:40.351 --> 01:14:41.352
What are you talking about?

01:14:41.435 --> 01:14:44.814
You wanna give the cure to cancer
to these fucking criminals?

01:14:44.897 --> 01:14:46.899
There is no cure for cancer!

01:14:46.983 --> 01:14:49.777
We'll give them the treatment
and we'll get back to our fake lives.

01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:51.696
I kind of like
the way mine is going now.

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:55.116
Are you out of your fucking mind, Charlie?
You're just gonna lay down?

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:59.036
Isn't that what got you a job at fucking
Save & Pay, being a pussy?

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:03.249
And you're some expert oncologist?
No, you're a guidance counselor.

01:15:03.332 --> 01:15:06.252
You're good at telling dumb kids
they might get into junior college.

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:09.922
Is this about the money?
Are you trying to get rich off this?

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.883
You know what, Charlie, you're a dick.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:14.885
Max, I'm sorry.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:18.472
Listen, I'm just trying to think
of a way out of this, all right?

01:15:18.556 --> 01:15:20.433
Max?

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.852
Max? Max?

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.270
Shit.

01:15:24.353 --> 01:15:27.231
You know, he's right about
not giving them the formula.

01:15:27.314 --> 01:15:29.316
But none of that matters
if we don't find it.

01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.152
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna go look for Max.

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.862
You stay here and search for it.

01:15:32.945 --> 01:15:34.822
And by the way...

01:15:34.905 --> 01:15:37.533
I like the way my life is going, too.

01:15:43.372 --> 01:15:44.915
Yeah.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.255
All right, let's do it.

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:54.800
What do we got here?

01:16:22.828 --> 01:16:24.663
Life's short, Charlie.

01:16:24.747 --> 01:16:26.999
- You know you're not really dead, right?
- No...

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.876
I just got caught up in the moment.

01:16:28.959 --> 01:16:30.753
Holy shit, I gotta sit down.

01:16:30.836 --> 01:16:32.756
You don't feel good.
What do you got, a hangover?

01:16:39.637 --> 01:16:40.930
I just cannot believe that this is how

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.431
- you would want to end everything.
- Stop.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:44.058
You're sick, Max!

01:16:44.183 --> 01:16:45.726
I'm your family.

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:47.895
- I'm sorry.
- I'm your family.

01:16:54.485 --> 01:16:57.113
That's Little Maxi.
Isn't he gorgeous?

01:16:57.196 --> 01:17:00.699
I wouldn't wish that on anybody.
Growing up without a dad.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:05.996
It's not a cure for cancer.

01:17:07.373 --> 01:17:09.416
It's a cure for Max's cancer.

01:17:15.422 --> 01:17:16.924
Cute kids.

01:17:17.007 --> 01:17:20.594
They're supposed to be with my ex tonight.
Said she was sick.

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:23.931
Probably got backstage passes to Slipknot.

01:17:24.014 --> 01:17:26.517
That's the tough thing about divorce.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.727
Gotta watch your dumb kids alone...

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:34.275
no sleep, while your ex is waking up
with 22-year-old bartenders,

01:17:34.358 --> 01:17:37.862
and who is footin' the bill for breakfast
and their herpes medicine?

01:17:37.945 --> 01:17:38.988
I am.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:43.617
Question, the, uh, thing with the, uh,
metal clamps, that, um...

01:17:43.701 --> 01:17:45.828
I'm looking for, uh...

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:49.290
Joe Pesci used it in Casino to,
you know, crush the guy's head?

01:17:49.373 --> 01:17:51.292
- You mean a vise?
- Yeah, sweetheart, that...

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:52.918
That's... A vise.

01:17:53.002 --> 01:17:54.795
We just carry auto parts.

01:17:54.879 --> 01:17:57.006
Try the hardware store.

01:18:20.196 --> 01:18:23.324
...the young cuckoo
will go so far as to fake injury,

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.826
prompting the adult jay

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:30.206
to carry the cuckoo along
the migratory route to eastern Africa.

01:18:30.289 --> 01:18:32.166
Only to fly back to...

01:18:32.249 --> 01:18:33.792
Hello, Shecky.

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:39.798
You see... I'm not buyin' the whole
cry routine, Shecky.

01:18:39.882 --> 01:18:41.675
Tell me where the formula is.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:42.968
I need an ambulance.

01:18:44.678 --> 01:18:46.513
Where the fuck is the formula?

01:18:46.597 --> 01:18:48.933
Truly, I don't know.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.436
Oh! Sweet Jesus!

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:55.189
Okay, I'm gonna have
to amp it up a little, aren't I?

01:18:55.272 --> 01:18:59.193
I am going to put your head
inside a fucking...

01:18:59.276 --> 01:19:02.279
What the fuck is the name of that thing,
with the clamp thing...

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.697
- A vise?
- A vise!

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:06.909
Yes, a vise, bitch!
Why do I keep forgetting that?

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.787
Come here.

01:19:11.163 --> 01:19:13.415
What's...
What's happening?

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:16.627
You are gonna tell me why you're lying,

01:19:16.710 --> 01:19:19.755
or I am gonna squeeze your head so hard,

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:22.841
that that fucking mustache
is gonna pop off your head.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.343
What is that?

01:19:24.426 --> 01:19:27.471
You've been shot!
You've been shot!

01:19:27.554 --> 01:19:29.223
You were right.

01:19:29.306 --> 01:19:31.308
I was lying...

01:19:31.392 --> 01:19:33.519
because I thought you were one of them.

01:19:33.602 --> 01:19:34.728
I was one of them?

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.230
I thought you were one of them!

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:38.857
No. I'm a good guy.

01:19:38.941 --> 01:19:41.443
Why would you pull the funding
if you're such a good guy?

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:46.448
They was gonna kill us
if we didn't stop the trials.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.409
Stay with me, Shecky!
Stay with me.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:49.535
Come on.

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.412
You're all right.
You're all right.

01:19:51.495 --> 01:19:52.496
Oh, God.

01:19:52.579 --> 01:19:54.415
Who's "they," Shecky?

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:59.878
Trojgaard are the world's largest
chemotherapy company.

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:03.090
- Trojgaard.
- Ronald didn't wanna sell 'em the drug,

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:06.802
because he knew they would bury it.

01:20:06.885 --> 01:20:08.554
Why would they bury it?

01:20:08.637 --> 01:20:11.598
A drug like that would be
worth billions of dollars.

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:14.184
A drug that replaces chemo...

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:17.229
would ultimately cost them...

01:20:17.313 --> 01:20:18.647
trillions.

01:20:36.165 --> 01:20:37.916
- Wait.
- What?

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.879
Make sure all my money
goes to cancer research.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:42.963
Yeah.

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:47.426
You can... have my Nikes.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:51.555
I know you had your eyes on them.

01:20:56.268 --> 01:20:58.062
You really are a good guy.

01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.231
Tell Mama I'm comin'.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:05.027
Shecky. Shecky!

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:07.071
I forgot to ask you, who killed you?

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.615
Shecky!

01:21:09.698 --> 01:21:11.742
Who did this to you?

01:21:11.825 --> 01:21:13.410
I think I have a clue.

01:21:16.497 --> 01:21:19.958
Please open up, it's Charlie McMillan.
I need to talk to you.

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:26.507
Please, it's about Max.
I think he's in trouble.

01:21:31.595 --> 01:21:33.180
Wow.

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:36.433
Look at all these fun toys
we have to play with.

01:21:36.517 --> 01:21:38.435
I'm a bit of a handyman.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:40.270
If you untie me, uh...

01:21:40.354 --> 01:21:42.231
I could show you how to use that shit.

01:21:43.774 --> 01:21:45.859
I think I can figure it out myself.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:48.987
Zip, zap, zee.

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.699
Are you fucking wearing the Nikes?

01:21:52.783 --> 01:21:54.993
Those are my sneakers.
He gave 'em to me.

01:21:55.077 --> 01:21:56.578
It was his dying wish.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:00.165
Finders keepers,
lose your sneakers.

01:22:00.249 --> 01:22:02.209
How are you fitting in those?
Those are 11s.

01:22:02.292 --> 01:22:04.002
You're fucking nine feet tall.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.922
You're like the Yao Ming of Nazis.
It's not making sense.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:09.383
There's always a way to make things fit.

01:22:11.635 --> 01:22:14.763
What were you planning
to do to poor Shecky with this?

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:17.182
Oh, that's just for my mom's Jeep.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:20.477
She needed a new gear shifter.
So that's what that's all about.

01:22:25.524 --> 01:22:29.570
I think I see
where you were going with this.

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:38.996
You are a sick fuck.
Just like me.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:42.458
Something tells me you're sicker.

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:44.334
It was a miracle.

01:22:45.294 --> 01:22:46.587
Then they shut it down.

01:22:46.670 --> 01:22:48.630
Dr. Fishman basically vanished,

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:51.425
he stopped returning
any of Max's phone calls.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:53.510
So finally, one night...

01:22:53.594 --> 01:22:55.888
Max drove over to the clinic.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.348
He saw that the lights were on,
so he kicked open the door.

01:22:58.432 --> 01:23:01.894
And that's when he saw Ron and Butch
laying dead on the floor.

01:23:02.853 --> 01:23:04.730
But why doesn't he call the cops?

01:23:04.855 --> 01:23:08.233
How was that gonna
help Max get any better?

01:23:08.317 --> 01:23:11.778
If Dr. Fishman was dead,
then Max was dead.

01:23:11.862 --> 01:23:16.742
So that's when he came up with this idea
to bring him back to life.

01:23:16.825 --> 01:23:18.368
But he couldn't do it alone,

01:23:18.452 --> 01:23:20.537
he needed somebody else.

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.414
He saw where you were in life.

01:23:24.541 --> 01:23:26.960
Uh... these are the...
This is the bank.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:31.215
He also saw that you...
probably needed it more than he did.

01:23:31.298 --> 01:23:32.799
Whoo!

01:23:35.719 --> 01:23:38.138
Now, I got a question.
What about this dark wig and glasses?

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:39.306
I don't get that.

01:23:39.389 --> 01:23:41.350
Yeah, that's a... a sex thing.

01:23:41.433 --> 01:23:43.268
It's a little...
It's kind of personal.

01:23:43.352 --> 01:23:45.103
Okay.

01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.022
Yeah, and I think that's why...

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:49.233
When he was on the phone with you,
and he had the blow-up doll.

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:50.859
What are you talking about?

01:23:50.943 --> 01:23:52.778
What did I say?
I didn't say anything.

01:23:52.861 --> 01:23:54.279
What are you talking about?

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:55.656
Nothing.
I don't know.

01:23:56.365 --> 01:23:57.699
- I don't know. Oh.
- I'm kidding.

01:23:57.783 --> 01:23:59.034
No, I bought him the doll.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:02.663
Oh, fuck.
Jeez, you both are nuts.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:04.540
Where is he, Charlie?

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:06.458
I don't know.
I would tell you.

01:24:06.542 --> 01:24:09.253
Dr. Fishman's widow is out there
right now looking for him.

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:13.382
Wait, that chick in the cottage
was Dr. Fishman's widow?

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:16.134
- Yeah.
- I had no idea he was even married.

01:24:16.218 --> 01:24:18.053
Neither did Dr. Ron, apparently,

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:20.639
considering he had a full-on
love affair with Butch.

01:24:20.722 --> 01:24:22.683
Wow. This all makes sense.

01:24:24.351 --> 01:24:27.813
- I never told Max this, but...
- this one time,

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:31.066
I saw Dr. Ron and Butch
coming out of an exam room,

01:24:31.149 --> 01:24:35.404
and I... I swear it looked like I had just
caught them doing something nasty.

01:24:35.487 --> 01:24:36.530
Oh...

01:24:36.613 --> 01:24:38.740
And he said that they were playing Jenga.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:42.369
Which I guess was, now, in retrospect,
their secret code for having sex.

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:43.912
"Jenga" is the secret code.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.624
- That's what I just said.
- That's the code. That's the code.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:51.461
Damn it, Max!
Pick up the fucking phone!

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.887
Sorry to disappoint, man, but...

01:25:00.971 --> 01:25:03.473
my old lady works my nips
pretty hard at home,

01:25:03.557 --> 01:25:05.851
so not much feeling left in 'em.

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:07.603
You should turn this shit up.

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.898
Perhaps you'll have more feeling
down in this area.

01:25:13.984 --> 01:25:16.903
Fuck me in the ass!

01:25:16.987 --> 01:25:18.905
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.

01:25:27.706 --> 01:25:30.917
Sorry, your call could not be
completed as dialed.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:34.254
Oh, that sounded just like
the recording, buddy.

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:36.048
Whoo!

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:41.887
Come on, Max.
God!

01:25:46.141 --> 01:25:47.351
Refrigerator.

01:25:50.771 --> 01:25:53.023
Oh, yeah.

01:26:02.032 --> 01:26:03.617
This is it.
This is it.

01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:07.162
Charlie, where are you?
I can't find Max anywhere.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:09.289
I found the formula!

01:26:09.373 --> 01:26:12.042
- What? Are you sure?
- Yes!

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:13.669
I'm looking at it right now!

01:26:13.752 --> 01:26:16.755
Ronald disguised it
as an app on his tablet!

01:26:16.838 --> 01:26:18.173
Wow, you're amazing.

01:26:18.256 --> 01:26:21.176
You are a geek,
but you are the man.

01:26:21.259 --> 01:26:23.845
I'm gonna find Max, okay?
I'm gonna try one more place.

01:26:25.055 --> 01:26:28.350
And I won all the gymnastics competitions
in sixth grade.

01:26:29.309 --> 01:26:34.064
Then my damned growth spurt.
Seventeen inches in 18 months.

01:26:35.232 --> 01:26:39.444
That, of course, put an end
to my competitive career.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:44.157
Lucky me, I found an occupation
that was even more enjoyable.

01:26:44.241 --> 01:26:47.661
Wow. What an amazing story
of personal triumph.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:51.289
Looking forward to watching the...
30 for 30 on that.

01:26:57.629 --> 01:27:00.757
I just wanna say, before you do
what you're about to do...

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:02.759
your boyfriend or husband or whatever

01:27:02.843 --> 01:27:07.514
is just a lucky man to find someone
so talented at ass play.

01:27:07.597 --> 01:27:08.724
Good on him.

01:27:08.807 --> 01:27:10.434
I'm not gay.

01:27:10.517 --> 01:27:13.270
Would you like some glass sprinkles?

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.604
Oh, come on. You...

01:27:14.688 --> 01:27:16.481
If you put that thing in my ass,
you're gay.

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:19.609
I mean, it's cool.
You're in a safe room.

01:27:19.693 --> 01:27:22.738
The only one getting fucked here is you.

01:27:22.821 --> 01:27:25.407
Yeah, yeah, but are
you gonna enjoy doing it?

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:27.784
Every last inch of it.

01:27:27.868 --> 01:27:29.786
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's a gay thing.

01:27:30.746 --> 01:27:33.665
That's... It's not gay.
It's torture.

01:27:33.749 --> 01:27:34.791
- No.
- That is different.

01:27:34.875 --> 01:27:36.251
Taking my fingernails off,

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:38.920
or fucking making me stay awake
for 12 weeks is torture,

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:40.630
but greasing up a dildo

01:27:40.714 --> 01:27:42.758
and pretending it's your own dick

01:27:42.841 --> 01:27:45.302
and wanting to stick it in me,
that's homosexuality.

01:27:45.385 --> 01:27:46.595
Textbook.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:49.848
Are you afraid to tell your parents,
is that it?

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.142
You know what?

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:53.393
I'm looking forward to this,

01:27:53.477 --> 01:27:55.479
and I'm not letting you
take it away from me

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.230
with your fucking mind games!

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.482
God damn it!

01:27:58.565 --> 01:28:00.567
All right, all right, all right.

01:28:00.650 --> 01:28:03.820
Look out, teeth, look out, gums,

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:05.322
look out, keister,

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:07.949
- here it comes!
- Oh, my God!

01:28:08.033 --> 01:28:09.075
Heather!

01:28:09.159 --> 01:28:11.620
Get the fuck out of here!
Run, he's crazy!

01:28:12.537 --> 01:28:14.831
What the hell are you doing?

01:28:14.915 --> 01:28:17.959
Nothing.
Just two straight guys having fun.

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:20.504
Well, stop fucking around.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:23.965
Call your boss.
Tell him to get ready to wire me my money.

01:28:27.719 --> 01:28:30.889
You lying bitch.
It was you.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:33.350
Of course it was me.

01:28:33.433 --> 01:28:34.810
Aw, Max.

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:38.104
Did you really think
that a woman in mourning

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.690
would let two strange buffoons
in her house,

01:28:40.774 --> 01:28:42.818
then run around in a slutty Barbie outfit

01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:44.694
and let one of them bang her,

01:28:44.778 --> 01:28:48.740
even though he's only 5'2"
and smells like a pile of shoes?

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:50.617
All I had to do was push my tits out

01:28:50.700 --> 01:28:53.703
and you followed them
like horny teenagers.

01:28:53.787 --> 01:28:56.998
Do you have any idea
how many lives this affects?

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.500
Why would you do this?

01:28:58.583 --> 01:29:03.630
Ronnie was offered a fortune
to bury the drug, but he refused.

01:29:03.713 --> 01:29:04.756
I didn't.

01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.424
I should've seen this coming.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:09.469
Charlie's always had
the shittiest taste in women.

01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:12.305
Huh, speak of the devil.

01:29:20.105 --> 01:29:24.192
Charlie,
I think Max killed Shecky!

01:29:24.276 --> 01:29:26.695
Yeah! He's out of control!

01:29:26.778 --> 01:29:29.531
You were right, I think he's
just doing this for the money.

01:29:29.614 --> 01:29:32.033
You have to leave his mom's house
right now, it's not safe.

01:29:33.535 --> 01:29:36.663
Meet me at Factor's Walk in 15 minutes
and bring the tablet.

01:29:36.746 --> 01:29:38.498
We have to make sure
we get it into the right hands

01:29:38.582 --> 01:29:40.041
before Max finds it.

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:42.669
Oh, and, Charlie...

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:44.796
be careful.

01:29:45.755 --> 01:29:47.632
I don't wanna lose you, too.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.886
Yeah.

01:29:55.473 --> 01:29:57.100
Aw...

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.019
He's so sweet.

01:29:59.102 --> 01:30:01.187
Actually, you are, too.

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.607
I would have rather fucked you.

01:30:03.690 --> 01:30:05.358
Put a bullet in his head.

01:30:11.364 --> 01:30:14.409
- Mmm.
- Relax. I'm not going to shoot you.

01:30:18.288 --> 01:30:19.998
That would be too quick.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:24.002
There's still so much fun for us to have.

01:30:27.547 --> 01:30:29.924
Hours of fun.

01:30:31.593 --> 01:30:32.969
Ooh...

01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:47.567
Look out!

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:53.657
Nice try, asshole.

01:31:08.213 --> 01:31:11.716
That's how he would have wanted to go.

01:31:17.681 --> 01:31:18.682
Charlie!

01:31:18.765 --> 01:31:20.475
- Charlie!
- Hey.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:22.143
Hey, baby. Baby.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:23.978
- Oh, my God, are you okay?
- I was so worried about you.

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:25.522
I know, I'm freaking out.

01:31:25.605 --> 01:31:27.816
I can't believe Max
would do that to Shecky.

01:31:27.899 --> 01:31:31.361
It's like we don't know anyone.
My husband, your best friend...

01:31:31.444 --> 01:31:33.780
- Money makes people crazy, Charlie.
- I know. I know.

01:31:33.863 --> 01:31:34.948
Did you bring the tablet?

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:37.242
Of course, of course.
It's right here.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:38.451
Yeah?

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:40.370
Oh!

01:31:40.453 --> 01:31:43.665
Motherfucker!
What the hell, Charlie?

01:31:43.748 --> 01:31:45.750
You picked the wrong guy to play, lady.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:49.838
I do know Max and he would
never kill an innocent man!

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:52.632
Well, I'm about to.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:59.097
I'm so tired...

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:01.891
...of women lying to me...

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:03.643
...and fucking me over!

01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:07.731
You know why everyone
treats you like that, Charlie?

01:32:07.814 --> 01:32:09.899
- Because you're such a pussy!
- Ow!

01:32:09.983 --> 01:32:11.901
God damn it!

01:32:11.985 --> 01:32:13.737
Ow...

01:32:13.820 --> 01:32:15.530
Ow!

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:24.414
I believe this is mine.

01:32:24.497 --> 01:32:26.332
It's been fun, Charlie.

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:27.709
No, no, no.

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:31.337
Before you kill me...
I want to tell you something.

01:32:32.172 --> 01:32:33.798
After we had sex...

01:32:36.593 --> 01:32:38.803
you farted in your sleep.

01:32:39.763 --> 01:32:41.097
Like, six times.

01:32:41.181 --> 01:32:44.142
Yeah, well, no one but you
will ever know that,

01:32:44.225 --> 01:32:46.811
because there's no way you're faking
your way out of this death, Charlie.

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:48.104
No.

01:32:55.153 --> 01:32:56.154
No!

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:06.748
Max! Ow! God!

01:33:06.831 --> 01:33:08.374
- Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.
- Charlie.

01:33:08.458 --> 01:33:11.961
I love you. Oh, man, I didn't
mean that shit I said about you.

01:33:12.045 --> 01:33:14.506
Fuck that shit.
I don't give a fuck, man.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.966
I just popped the perfect wheelie.
I could be a cop.

01:33:17.050 --> 01:33:18.051
Did you see that?

01:33:18.134 --> 01:33:20.595
- All I had to do was fucking...
- I saw the whole thing.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:21.798
- You looked good.
- Come on.

01:33:21.846 --> 01:33:23.097
It's déjà vu.

01:33:23.181 --> 01:33:25.850
I get to kill Butch and Ronnie
all over again.

01:33:25.934 --> 01:33:28.978
You two wanna tickle each other's
balls first, like they used to?

01:33:29.062 --> 01:33:31.231
Or should I kill you straight away?

01:35:39.442 --> 01:35:40.568
Stay where you are!

01:35:41.277 --> 01:35:44.155
Drop your weapon
and get your hands in the air!

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:47.492
- No!
- What happened?

01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:50.203
What?

01:35:50.286 --> 01:35:52.163
- Oh, no!
- What the fuck?

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.831
What, what?

01:35:53.915 --> 01:35:56.834
You fucking threw the shit
in the fucking water!

01:35:56.918 --> 01:35:59.295
There was
a gun pointed at my head!

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.432
Bob?
From American Express Bob?

01:36:11.516 --> 01:36:14.352
Actually it's Bob from the FBI.

01:36:14.435 --> 01:36:17.146
Oh... shit.

01:36:17.230 --> 01:36:18.564
Here, take the dinosaur.

01:36:18.648 --> 01:36:19.816
Yeah, go play.

01:36:19.899 --> 01:36:21.442
What is it?

01:36:22.026 --> 01:36:23.546
We fished the tablet out of the water.

01:36:23.611 --> 01:36:26.322
I had my best tech guys take a look at it.

01:36:26.406 --> 01:36:27.740
And, uh...

01:36:29.158 --> 01:36:30.535
it's a goner.

01:36:32.328 --> 01:36:33.371
All right.

01:36:34.747 --> 01:36:36.040
I'm really sorry.

01:36:36.124 --> 01:36:38.960
Oh, baby, we'll find another way.

01:36:39.043 --> 01:36:40.545
We're gonna find another way.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:41.629
Yeah.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:43.923
We'll keep fighting.
We'll keep fighting.

01:36:44.007 --> 01:36:47.969
Mrs. Kessler...
your husband's under arrest.

01:36:48.052 --> 01:36:50.596
When your friend finishes getting
his broken ribs patched up,

01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:52.432
I gotta take both of you directly to jail.

01:36:52.515 --> 01:36:54.267
Fuck he is, man!

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:56.019
Do you know how long
I've waited for this one?

01:36:56.102 --> 01:36:57.311
- Sorry, baby.
- All right, we're good.

01:36:57.395 --> 01:36:58.515
- We're good.
- Real emotional.

01:36:58.563 --> 01:36:59.731
What's this?
What's this? Wait! Wait! Whoa!

01:36:59.814 --> 01:37:03.026
Whoa! He's got broken ribs...
why is he knocked out right now?

01:37:03.109 --> 01:37:04.569
We're taking him into surgery.

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:08.614
We found something rather alarming
in his rectum.

01:37:08.698 --> 01:37:10.158
- What? What?
- What just happened?

01:37:10.241 --> 01:37:12.827
It appears to be a USB drive.

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:18.374
You backed it up?

01:37:18.458 --> 01:37:20.293
He backed it up!

01:37:20.376 --> 01:37:24.047
- You careful motherfucker! Yes!
- Oh!

01:37:27.216 --> 01:37:28.259
Yes!

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:29.385
Charlie!

01:37:29.469 --> 01:37:31.179
You did it, boy! Yes!

01:37:31.262 --> 01:37:32.472
Yeah!

01:37:32.555 --> 01:37:34.515
You know,
a good friend of mine once told me,

01:37:34.599 --> 01:37:36.479
"You always have to have
a rubber in your wallet

01:37:36.517 --> 01:37:37.810
and an umbrella in your trunk,

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:40.229
'cause you never know when
you're gonna fuck in the rain."

01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:43.107
He also suggested carrying
around zombie makeup

01:37:43.191 --> 01:37:45.234
for those times when
you want to strike terror

01:37:45.318 --> 01:37:47.862
into the hearts of people
who screwed you over.

01:37:50.907 --> 01:37:53.326
Please don't eat me.
Don't eat me! Eat her!

01:37:55.661 --> 01:37:58.623
Go get your own fucking fortune cookies!

01:38:00.583 --> 01:38:03.336
And most importantly,
when you're really in trouble,

01:38:03.419 --> 01:38:05.630
when you've committed many,
many crimes

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:08.508
across several states
and a US territory...

01:38:08.591 --> 01:38:12.470
there's only one chip that can
get you off scot-free.

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:15.932
One card that you can play
to get you out of anything.

01:38:16.057 --> 01:38:18.309
An effective treatment for cancer.

01:38:48.214 --> 01:38:49.924
Good job!

01:38:50.007 --> 01:38:51.425
- That was so...
- Yeah.

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.386
Yeah.

01:38:57.515 --> 01:38:59.058
What are you doing, Mother?

01:38:59.142 --> 01:39:00.768
Why would you do that, Ma?

01:39:00.852 --> 01:39:06.232
I just wanted to bring back
some sweet memories to Charlie.

01:39:06.315 --> 01:39:09.610
That's really nice, Ma.
He's crying. You happy?

01:39:09.694 --> 01:39:12.572
Do they still look as good as they looked

01:39:12.655 --> 01:39:14.365
when you peeked on me in the shower?

01:39:14.448 --> 01:39:16.826
They're even better!

01:39:16.909 --> 01:39:18.828
He's being polite.
It's awful!

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:22.039
They might have a
few more miles on them...

01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:26.294
- but they still taste brand new.
- Oh!

01:39:26.377 --> 01:39:29.088
All right, enjoy yourself, Ma,
you're in Puerto Rico.

01:39:29.172 --> 01:39:31.507
Hey, come on.
Let's do this.

01:39:31.591 --> 01:39:33.885
No, no, no, no, I'm tired.
I'm sorry.

01:39:33.968 --> 01:39:35.219
- Do it, you should.
- You're in remission.

01:39:35.303 --> 01:39:37.847
You can't play that cancer card anymore.
Let's go.

01:39:37.930 --> 01:39:40.892
Hey! Just do it so we can go out and eat.
I'm fuckin' starving!

01:39:40.975 --> 01:39:42.476
- Carmine, be nice.
- I am nice.

01:39:42.560 --> 01:39:45.062
- I have low blood sugar, you know that.
- Carmine's hungry!

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:46.731
You can't fucking keep him waitin'.
Let's go!

01:39:46.814 --> 01:39:49.358
Let's go!
All right, love you guys.

01:39:49.442 --> 01:39:51.194
- Be safe!
- Yep.

01:40:04.207 --> 01:40:06.209
Sure about this, tough guy?

01:40:06.292 --> 01:40:07.335
Fuck yes.

01:40:08.294 --> 01:40:09.670
You only live twice, right?
