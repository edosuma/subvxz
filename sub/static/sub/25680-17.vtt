-I'm so sorry! I'll go change.
-Hang on!

20:17.425 --> 20:19.219
You know...

20:19.302 --> 20:22.472
our older customers actually
drink a lot of coconut water.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.433
But for some reason,
they don't buy Fancy Coconut Water.

20:25.517 --> 20:26.518
It's true!

20:26.601 --> 20:28.770
We find the brand
very intimidating.

20:30.230 --> 20:33.692
Maybe this ad campaign
is targeting the wrong market.

20:33.775 --> 20:35.443
Old is bold!

20:35.527 --> 20:37.696
Amelia, stay in this outfit.

20:37.779 --> 20:41.700
You're gonna be the star of a whole series
of Fancy Coconut Water ads

20:41.783 --> 20:44.744
directed specifically
at the over-70 crowd.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.246
And you're gonna
be in it, too.

20:46.329 --> 20:47.622
Who peed in the stew?

20:47.706 --> 20:49.332
Okay, new plan!

20:49.416 --> 20:50.417
Just Amelia.

21:09.185 --> 21:10.979
-Show's not over.
-Excuse me!

21:11.062 --> 21:12.689
You can't be up here.
School rules.

21:12.772 --> 21:15.025
They're not a group!
They're a duo!

21:15.108 --> 21:17.027
That's where
you're wrong, Finkle.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.529
We may be a duo,
but we're more than two voices.

21:19.612 --> 21:21.489
You took the fun
out of a cappella,

21:21.573 --> 21:24.284
-so we're putting it back in.

Your group looks

22:41.528 --> 22:42.654
Can we still join?

22:42.737 --> 22:44.698
Sure! But fair warning,

22:44.781 --> 22:47.826
our initiation process
is very intense.

No!

22:55.750 --> 22:57.419
You can't form your own group!

22:57.502 --> 22:58.628
This can't be happening.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.130
Oh, it's happening.

23:00.213 --> 23:04.342
Your reign as a cappella dictator

Hey, thanks for making my
a cappella dreams come true.

23:21.192 --> 23:22.360
Uh, you can take off the vest now.

Oh, not a chance, girlfriend.

-That was awful.
-I loved it.
