WEBVTT

00:04.358 --> 00:06.774
It's like watching a
mummy unwrap itself.

00:06.774 --> 00:09.342
I mean, how long can
this go on for, really?

00:09.376 --> 00:12.745
Oh, she'll... she'll get there.
Oh, nope, nope, she's going

00:12.780 --> 00:14.948
- in the wrong direction now.
- Come on, Myrtle.

00:14.982 --> 00:17.216
Oh, this could take a while.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.954
Ugh, can we, like, get some
coat hooks or something?

00:20.988 --> 00:23.423
Well, before we do that,
can we fix this drip?

00:23.457 --> 00:24.958
Or, like, at least get a new bucket?

00:24.992 --> 00:28.861
Oh, I would love to fix
that, but, no, corporate

00:28.896 --> 00:32.265
only gave us $15.00
for break room repairs,

00:32.299 --> 00:34.734
and we blew through
that on the bat traps.

00:34.768 --> 00:36.970
Speaking of corporate, this
memo just came through:

00:37.004 --> 00:38.538
"This time of year, many of us suffer

00:38.572 --> 00:39.672
from Seasonal Affective Disorder.

00:39.707 --> 00:41.908
Look out for the following
symptoms of depression..."

00:41.942 --> 00:43.972
Pfft! Who would get depressed here?

00:43.972 --> 00:45.757
- "Listlessness..."
- Come on.

00:45.773 --> 00:47.073
- "Irritability..."
- You wish.

00:47.100 --> 00:48.567
- "General discontent..."
- No way.

00:48.601 --> 00:50.169
- "Apathy..."
- Give me a break.

00:50.203 --> 00:53.105
"Above all, remember Cloud 9 cares.

00:53.139 --> 00:55.841
This memo clears parent
company of any liability

00:55.875 --> 00:57.109
for employee suicide."

00:57.143 --> 00:59.611
Hmm, Cloud 9 really does care.

00:59.646 --> 01:00.705
Well, they did send a letter.

01:02.352 --> 01:05.650
- Synced and corrected by hawken45 -
- www.addic7ed.com -

01:07.818 --> 01:10.520
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Dina, what's up?

01:10.546 --> 01:12.380
So are you just planning to avoid me

01:12.415 --> 01:13.481
until one of us quits, or...?

01:13.516 --> 01:16.451
No, no, no, no, it's just,
you know, I've been busy.

01:16.485 --> 01:19.521
You know, different shifts,
whatevers and etceteras.

01:19.555 --> 01:24.192
Look, Dina, the time we
had together was special,

01:24.226 --> 01:25.604
but, as a child of divorce...

01:25.604 --> 01:26.491
Oh, believe me.

01:26.524 --> 01:28.592
I have absolutely no
interest in pursuing this.

01:28.626 --> 01:31.128
I mean, do you have any idea
the kind of men I've had?

01:31.162 --> 01:34.298
Sky diving instructors, hand models,

01:34.332 --> 01:36.800
two of the original members
of Fine Young Cannibals.

01:36.835 --> 01:39.103
- Come on.
- Okay, well, great.

01:39.259 --> 01:41.168
So just a one time thing then.

01:41.170 --> 01:41.805
Oh, yeah.

01:42.314 --> 01:43.671
Just don't be weird,
and things will be fine.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.695
Okay, I won't be weird,
lady who has multiple birds.

01:50.000 --> 01:56.074

01:57.927 --> 01:59.928
- Sandra's up.
- All right, Sandra!

02:01.938 --> 02:04.126
- Am I doing this right?
- Yes, but pace yourself.

02:04.143 --> 02:06.404
Okay. I can't believe you
guys do this every year.

02:06.406 --> 02:09.114
Well, corporate tells us to clean
out Lost and Found every January,

02:09.148 --> 02:10.282
but they never tell us how.

02:10.316 --> 02:12.584
We used to give it to charity,
but then Goodwill told us

02:12.618 --> 02:14.119
not to leave our trash
on their loading dock.

02:14.153 --> 02:17.022
Hurry up, Sandra. It's not like
you're gonna find a man in there.

02:17.063 --> 02:19.631
Please, hold on, last year
I ended up with a broken comb.

02:19.659 --> 02:20.421
I just need one second.

02:20.421 --> 02:21.822
Boo! Three, two, one.

02:21.856 --> 02:24.374
- Ah!
- And Sandra's got

02:24.390 --> 02:28.195
an old pair of dentures, yes!

02:28.229 --> 02:30.464
A lot of good stuff in there this year.

02:30.498 --> 02:35.369
Oh, hey, uh, Tate, you're
basically a doctor, right?

02:35.403 --> 02:38.505
Even better, I'm a pharmacist.
Doctor to the doctors.

02:38.539 --> 02:40.473
Oh, close enough, anyway I...

02:40.489 --> 02:44.743
Do I regret not going for the big M-D?
Not usually, sometimes.

02:45.376 --> 02:49.304
Yeah, when I'm laying in my tanning
bed alone with my thoughts...

02:49.752 --> 02:50.681
sometimes.

02:51.826 --> 02:54.828
Hey, anyway, um, I wanted
to ask you a question.

02:54.863 --> 02:56.430
- Sure.
- Okay, I always thought

02:56.464 --> 02:58.499
depression was this thing
that housewives invented

02:58.533 --> 03:00.279
so they could take extra naps,

03:01.178 --> 03:03.837
but you don't think that people
around here could have it, do you?

03:03.872 --> 03:05.439
Well, there are lots of employees here

03:05.473 --> 03:06.421
on antidepressants.

03:06.422 --> 03:07.223
What? Who?

03:07.562 --> 03:09.663
Glenn, you know I can't tell you that.

03:10.029 --> 03:10.991
Well, how many?

03:11.413 --> 03:12.814
About 20.

03:12.846 --> 03:14.285
13 women, 7 men.

03:14.287 --> 03:17.120
Now, I can't give you names,
but it's mostly the uggos.

03:17.844 --> 03:19.490
Doesn't really narrow it down.

03:19.955 --> 03:22.890
You know, I do volunteer work
at this children's ward,

03:22.925 --> 03:25.472
and there's a guy who
dresses up as a clown

03:25.473 --> 03:27.503
and goes around cheering up the kids.

03:27.830 --> 03:28.997
Maybe that would work?

03:29.031 --> 03:30.932
They say laughter's the best medicine.

03:30.966 --> 03:32.685
The best medicine is penicillin.

03:33.268 --> 03:35.570
At least it used to be.
With all these superbugs now,

03:35.604 --> 03:36.971
we might all be dead in ten years,

03:37.006 --> 03:39.286
so I guess laughter's
as good as anything.

03:39.808 --> 03:40.541
Okay.

03:40.685 --> 03:42.209
All right, ticktock, come on.

03:42.241 --> 03:44.521
I think I saw a stuffed giraffe in here,

03:44.556 --> 03:47.458
and Harmonica loves
giraffes, so, uh, ooh!

03:47.493 --> 03:49.562
And it's a wig.

03:49.586 --> 03:52.531
Ooh, I can't give this to her.

03:52.564 --> 03:55.032
She'll think I'm slamming
her for being bald.

03:55.067 --> 03:58.369
Ooh, oh, it's a VHS copy
of "Murder, She Wrote,"

03:58.403 --> 04:01.105
seasons three, episodes
seven through nine.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.648
Oh, God. Cargo shorts?

04:04.649 --> 04:08.919
A journal. All right,
what do we got here?

04:08.953 --> 04:09.820
A lot of boobs.

04:09.854 --> 04:12.556
There you go girl, oh, yeah!

04:12.590 --> 04:14.558
- Ooh.
- Hey.

04:14.592 --> 04:16.760
- Ooh.
- Oh, a purse.

04:16.793 --> 04:18.795
- Oh, look at this.
- Ooh.

04:18.829 --> 04:19.863
You could swap.

04:19.897 --> 04:23.400
There's a squeaker in it, too.
How cute is that?

04:23.434 --> 04:25.769
- Ooh.
- Why?

04:25.803 --> 04:28.939
Ahh, there it is. My birds love these.

04:30.633 --> 04:33.483
Okay. Wow, that actually
looks really nice.

04:33.515 --> 04:34.472
Someone left that here?

04:34.472 --> 04:36.402
Ooh, this kind of works on me.

04:36.434 --> 04:40.038
Yeah, it's great, if you wanna wear
a man's jacket and look like a man.

04:40.039 --> 04:42.770
Hey, everyone, look at that man
wearing that man's jacket.

04:42.942 --> 04:45.062
Get used to it 'cause
you're gonna hear it a lot.

04:45.078 --> 04:47.729
Hey, Mateo, would you
like to swap this leather jacket

04:47.730 --> 04:49.057
for your cargo shorts?

04:49.059 --> 04:49.964
What? No.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.024
Are you sure? 'Cause I don't care.

04:52.040 --> 04:54.066
But, you know, if...
if you want, I mean, yeah.

04:54.090 --> 04:54.922
If you're gonna be a
little bitch about it.

04:54.924 --> 04:56.177
Thank you so much.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.705
Okay, who's next?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.561
Hey, Cheyenne.

05:13.561 --> 05:14.402
How you doing?

05:15.997 --> 05:18.365
Just a little down, you know, some days

05:18.399 --> 05:21.011
you get the giraffe, and
other days you get the wig.

05:21.569 --> 05:23.079
That's so true.

05:23.838 --> 05:28.308
But hey, what is your
favorite animal, hmm?

05:28.350 --> 05:30.835
Ooh, a peacock.

05:32.013 --> 05:33.280
A peacock.

05:33.314 --> 05:35.882
Okay, that's... that's ambitious.

05:35.909 --> 05:37.958
I know how to do a dog, so...

05:38.419 --> 05:39.412
Okay, dog.

05:39.537 --> 05:41.150
No, no, you said peacock.

05:41.181 --> 05:42.896
One peacock, coming up.

05:42.939 --> 05:44.773
Ow!

05:44.792 --> 05:45.735
My eye! Ow, ow, ow!

05:45.737 --> 05:46.928
Oh, oh, no, no, I did

05:46.961 --> 05:49.296
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

05:50.798 --> 05:53.734
Hey, Janet. What's your favorite animal?

05:53.768 --> 05:55.431
A clownfish...

05:56.145 --> 05:56.738
Okay.

05:56.771 --> 05:58.805
Riding a bicycle.

06:02.477 --> 06:04.745
Hey, Dina, uh, I can't work on Thursday,

06:04.779 --> 06:05.946
but Brett said he'd cover for me,

06:05.980 --> 06:06.913
so could you change the schedule?

06:06.948 --> 06:11.318
Oh, boy, here we go.
Cue Garrett being weird.

06:11.352 --> 06:13.820
What? No, I'm just...
I can't work on Thursday, so...

06:13.855 --> 06:16.790
Do you even hear yourself right now?

06:16.824 --> 06:17.891
Wow.

06:19.460 --> 06:22.763
No, you were supposed to
cancel dinner with your parents.

06:22.797 --> 06:25.415
No, Adam, I can't keep
doing everything for you.

06:26.308 --> 06:28.331
No, I'm not yelling, I am whispering.

06:28.339 --> 06:32.396
Okay, you know what? I can't talk about
this right now, I'm at work. Good-bye.

06:33.057 --> 06:35.833
Amy, I have an important question.

06:36.365 --> 06:37.766
Might I borrow these this weekend?

06:37.800 --> 06:39.034
I'm attending the opera.

06:39.068 --> 06:42.370
Um, yes, all you need now is a T-shirt

06:42.405 --> 06:44.906
with Bugs Bunny dressed like
a cholo, and you're ready to go.

06:44.941 --> 06:46.675
Oh, you know what?

06:46.709 --> 06:49.390
I think you left some
stuff in your pockets.

06:49.944 --> 06:53.714
Yeah, here we go.
Here is your old end of a joint.

06:53.716 --> 06:54.014
Enjoy.

06:54.016 --> 06:55.496
Yes, I've been looking for that.

06:55.498 --> 06:58.753
Here's your halffilled tin of dip,
didn't know you were a dipper.

06:58.788 --> 07:00.922
Yeah, don't even talk
to me before I dip.

07:01.340 --> 07:03.732
Fliers for sexy escorts.

07:03.787 --> 07:04.298
Gross.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.405
This one says, "Carerra is gymnast."

07:07.675 --> 07:10.966
So you might wanna keep her
at the top of the pile.

07:11.705 --> 07:16.464
An old receipt, and, uh, here is your...

07:17.296 --> 07:18.945
giant wad of cash.

07:23.751 --> 07:24.558
Seriously?

07:25.291 --> 07:27.157
Oh, yeah.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.719
I'm the bad boy of my friend group.

07:30.413 --> 07:33.715
- Silly string attack!
- No, what are you doing?

07:33.750 --> 07:36.218
- What?
- This stuff stains.

07:37.080 --> 07:40.439
I'm so sorry. I was just
trying to brighten your day.

07:43.136 --> 07:44.437
Here.

07:47.306 --> 07:48.779
I forgot it was gonna do that.

07:49.436 --> 07:51.676
Nine hundred and six dollars.

07:51.677 --> 07:52.978
Somewhere in St. Louis,

07:52.978 --> 07:55.834
there's an overweight stoner
who can't pay his escort.

07:56.201 --> 07:57.252
What are you gonna do with it?

07:57.252 --> 07:59.086
I don't know, I mean,
I guess I'll pay some bills...

07:59.120 --> 08:00.420
- Mm-hmm.
- And then my sister needs

08:00.455 --> 08:02.889
a new windshield,
and my mom's crisper drawer

08:02.924 --> 08:06.259
in her fridge is broken, so...

08:06.574 --> 08:09.209
So sorry, I-I get
that your mother's fridge

08:09.243 --> 08:12.946
is super exciting, but I meant
what are you gonna do for you?

08:13.463 --> 08:14.425
I don't need anything.

08:14.425 --> 08:16.120
No, it's not about need.
This is not about need.

08:16.121 --> 08:19.243
This is free money. This is your
chance to get you something.

08:19.245 --> 08:21.693
So I want you to close your eyes...
do it...

08:21.693 --> 08:23.232
and I'm gonna ask you a question,

08:23.241 --> 08:25.853
and I want you to say the first
thing that pops into your mind.

08:25.855 --> 08:27.622
Stop laughing.
Take this seriously, okay?

08:27.654 --> 08:28.320
Okay, I'm sorry,

08:28.321 --> 08:30.627
I just keep having this mental
image of you doing that cliché

08:30.629 --> 08:31.941
where you get me to
magically discover the

08:31.943 --> 08:33.284
one thing I never knew I wanted...
so dumb.

08:33.285 --> 08:34.169
Okay, my mind's clear.

08:34.203 --> 08:36.804
Well, now you ruined it, so you're
never gonna know what you want.

08:36.839 --> 08:40.508
Okay, look, if I were
gonna splurge on myself,

08:40.543 --> 08:43.278
there is this really fancy spa
that I drive by every day

08:43.312 --> 08:45.647
on my way to work, and I have imagined

08:45.681 --> 08:48.817
what it would be like to, like, go
in there and be like, do it up.

08:48.851 --> 08:50.351
Yes! You be selfish.

08:50.386 --> 08:51.400
This is your moment.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.023
Yeah, I'm going to.

08:53.024 --> 08:54.507
Good, I'm glad I could help.

08:54.898 --> 08:56.965
You didn't really do that much, but...

08:56.965 --> 08:57.912
Anytime.

08:57.945 --> 08:58.501
Okay.

09:02.293 --> 09:04.160
Huh? Come on, huh?

09:04.194 --> 09:06.462
I guess it's starting to work.

09:06.497 --> 09:08.164
Maybe if you go a little faster?

09:08.198 --> 09:09.940
Yeah, I can go faster, sure.

09:11.569 --> 09:13.336
Yeah, the fog's definitely lifting now.

09:13.370 --> 09:15.171
Oh, good! Good, good.

09:15.205 --> 09:16.773
Whew! Sorry, 'cause...

09:16.807 --> 09:18.641
I need to take a little break.

09:18.676 --> 09:22.612
Oh, yeah, fine, just stop.
Just make it all stop.

09:22.973 --> 09:25.108
No, no, no, no, no, I-I'll keep going.

09:25.142 --> 09:27.677
Here we go, okay.
Ahh, having a good time.

09:30.180 --> 09:31.806
Stop smiling at me.

09:31.807 --> 09:32.850
I'm not smiling at you.

09:32.882 --> 09:34.019
Oh, grow up.

09:36.892 --> 09:39.068
Come on, I'm going faster, see?

09:39.894 --> 09:40.827
Fast as I can.

09:43.738 --> 09:45.436
Hey, come here and check it out.

09:45.833 --> 09:49.636
Salt scrub, essential oils,
deep tissue rub-down.

09:49.670 --> 09:52.339
For 900 bucks, they basically
treat you like a brisket.

09:52.373 --> 09:55.976
For 900 bucks minus the
80 or so I may have given

09:56.010 --> 09:57.734
to Cheyenne for diapers.

09:58.349 --> 09:59.755
You suck at being selfish.

09:59.781 --> 10:02.944
Look, $820.00 is plenty
to have a nice day at the spa.

10:02.976 --> 10:07.046
And every single penny of that
money is going to this girl.

10:07.080 --> 10:10.116
Amy found $900.00!
What should we all do with it?

10:11.577 --> 10:15.131
In retrospect, perhaps I shouldn't
have told her how much we found.

10:15.605 --> 10:17.839
You should've just fixed
your mom's crisper.

10:18.125 --> 10:19.191
I don't remember.

10:23.716 --> 10:26.863
Hey! No monkey business at work.

10:28.001 --> 10:30.517
Yeah, you have to
tell me if you're smiling.

10:30.876 --> 10:31.481
I'm not.

10:31.823 --> 10:33.711
Well, I bet I can cheer you up,

10:33.716 --> 10:35.584
or I'm a monkey's uncle.

10:36.585 --> 10:40.312
Oh, well, I guess the thing that's
really concerning me is my boss.

10:40.723 --> 10:41.823
He's got a lot of problems.

10:42.112 --> 10:44.725
What? That's bananas.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.687
Yeah, uh, actually, none of
his employees respect him,

10:48.016 --> 10:50.305
retail's dying, yet he
works at a crap store,

10:50.644 --> 10:52.772
he tried to be a deacon at
his church like five times,

10:52.791 --> 10:54.481
but they just don't want him.

10:55.523 --> 10:57.457
Oh, and for the record,
that whole banana thing?

10:57.491 --> 10:58.436
That's actually a myth.

10:58.438 --> 11:01.561
Yeah, most monkeys live and die
without ever having seen a banana.

11:01.562 --> 11:04.341
Their lives are short,
violent, and horrifying.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.935
Dina?

11:12.439 --> 11:13.572
Are you there?

11:14.017 --> 11:16.652
Well, I would return the money
if I knew whose it was,

11:16.686 --> 11:17.560
but there was no ID.

11:17.561 --> 11:19.928
Although we did find weed,
dip, porn, and a receipt

11:19.962 --> 11:22.980
for an Arizona iced tea, so we
know it's somebody with class.

11:22.982 --> 11:24.967
Was the iced tea raspberry or regular?

11:24.967 --> 11:26.422
Does it matter, Sandra?

11:26.455 --> 11:28.407
No. Sorry.

11:29.195 --> 11:31.259
So do we all just split the money?

11:32.197 --> 11:32.681
Well...

11:32.682 --> 11:36.842
Yo, I say we take this money to the
track, double it, then double it again,

11:36.842 --> 11:39.077
double it again, then lose it.

11:39.110 --> 11:41.311
Guys, guys, hold on just a second.

11:41.346 --> 11:43.981
So Amy found the money,
and Amy's always wanted

11:44.015 --> 11:45.949
to get a massage at this day spa.

11:45.984 --> 11:48.497
So we're all just gonna go get massages?

11:48.498 --> 11:50.331
- That's...
- He's got a point though.

11:50.373 --> 11:52.641
We should treat ourselves
to something nice.

11:52.669 --> 11:52.953
No.

11:52.954 --> 11:54.861
Well, since Amy grifted
me, can we at least

11:54.863 --> 11:56.639
use some of the money to buy coat hooks?

11:56.672 --> 11:59.274
Oh, and some lamps because
these fluorescent lights

11:59.308 --> 12:01.276
got people looking like Tilda Swinton.

12:01.310 --> 12:03.745
Ooh, and Amy, you can
finally get your bucket.

12:03.779 --> 12:05.647
But, guys, these are...
there are all great ideas,

12:05.681 --> 12:09.584
but, um, Amy found the money,
so maybe Amy should be able

12:09.618 --> 12:11.369
to do with it as she pleases.

12:11.954 --> 12:17.726
Right, and, um, what I
wanna do with it is...

12:21.464 --> 12:22.988
Fix up the break room.

12:23.666 --> 12:26.768
Yo, this is gonna be dope.
We're gonna get all these lamps.

12:26.802 --> 12:29.604
- What?
- I get a new bucket.

12:29.638 --> 12:31.406
- A bucket?
- Yeah, a new one.

12:35.690 --> 12:38.858
Hey, look, I just
wanted to clarify about

12:38.859 --> 12:40.804
earlier when I was smiling, I wasn't.

12:41.404 --> 12:45.640
I mean, I wasn't smiling at you.
See, I was pretending to smile

12:45.675 --> 12:48.210
because Glenn is, like,
trying to make people happy,

12:48.244 --> 12:49.478
and, like, was doing, so I was...

12:50.206 --> 12:52.226
Look, point is, I wasn't being weird.

12:53.182 --> 12:56.218
Right, okay, so you
accidentally smiled at me,

12:56.252 --> 12:58.086
then let your neuroses build
up to the point that you

12:58.121 --> 13:00.388
had to track me down
in the dressing rooms

13:00.423 --> 13:03.558
to explain it away...
like a normal person.

13:03.625 --> 13:06.189
Oh, no, I just...
what... what I was doing...

13:06.205 --> 13:08.597
Is this your first time?
Is that what this is about?

13:08.631 --> 13:09.186
No...

13:09.186 --> 13:11.533
Listen, it's nothing
to be ashamed of, okay?

13:11.567 --> 13:13.668
You're actually the third
v-card I've taken.

13:13.703 --> 13:15.337
And don't you go
falling in love with me.

13:16.472 --> 13:17.706
What?

13:20.710 --> 13:24.079
Ooh, a panini press!
We could have hot sandwiches.

13:24.113 --> 13:26.146
Uh, okay, yeah. Put it in the cart.

13:27.150 --> 13:28.717
What? I love hot sandwiches.

13:28.751 --> 13:30.285
- Ask anybody.
- I just thought

13:30.319 --> 13:32.754
that the rest of the money
was gonna go to this gal.

13:32.789 --> 13:35.423
It is because what makes me happy

13:35.458 --> 13:37.125
is seeing other people be happy.

13:37.160 --> 13:39.261
Oh, really? Great, because I would be

13:39.295 --> 13:44.299
so happy if I had
a psychedelic lava lamp.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.133
Then you should have it.

13:45.168 --> 13:47.602
Great, that's... okay, thank you.

13:47.637 --> 13:50.880
You know what? This is gonna look
really nice with my brand-new

13:50.880 --> 13:53.095
framed photo of Ronald Regan.

13:54.949 --> 13:55.849
That too.

13:55.883 --> 13:59.035
Fantastic, do we sell
above-ground pools?

14:07.929 --> 14:10.034
Uh, hey, don't get up.

14:10.034 --> 14:12.085
Uh, are you the one I'm
supposed to talk to about

14:12.086 --> 14:14.076
changing the water
cooler in the pharmacy?

14:14.078 --> 14:14.634
Nah, man.

14:14.668 --> 14:19.305
Oh, I'd do it myself,
but not waterproof.

14:19.339 --> 14:20.840
It's heavy though, you wanna try it on?

14:20.874 --> 14:21.807
Nah, I'm cool.

14:21.809 --> 14:24.935
Don't be shy. My other
one's better, of course.

14:25.218 --> 14:26.726
Wouldn't wear it here.
Way too expensive.

14:26.727 --> 14:28.698
What it do, Pikachu?

14:32.218 --> 14:33.251
Ugh.

14:35.354 --> 14:36.326
Well, that was weird.

14:36.326 --> 14:39.108
No, it wasn't weird.

14:39.108 --> 14:40.334
It was completely normal.

14:40.335 --> 14:42.895
Everything... I'm chill, man.

14:43.704 --> 14:44.837
Okay.

14:48.442 --> 14:51.277
Hey, excuse me, uh, my son
is taking dishes off the shelves

14:51.311 --> 14:52.512
and smashing them on the floor.

14:52.546 --> 14:53.964
Can you, uh, stop him?

14:54.515 --> 14:56.783
I don't want him to think
of me as a bad guy.

14:56.817 --> 14:59.619
Um, let me find someone
to help you with that.

15:04.158 --> 15:05.491
Where is everybody?

15:15.202 --> 15:17.196
This is the best day of my life.

15:18.739 --> 15:20.155
You just had a baby.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.345
What ya doing there, buddy?

15:26.380 --> 15:26.931
Hi.

15:31.485 --> 15:34.287
Oh, you're... oh, okay,
uh, here, hand me one.

15:34.321 --> 15:37.523
I got ya, I got ya. Thanks... ooh!

15:39.593 --> 15:42.345
This is real heavy.

15:45.332 --> 15:46.588
You going somewhere?

15:47.568 --> 15:50.894
Oh, you're taking the stairs.
Uh, I'm gonna take the elevator.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.509
Mommy, look!

15:56.574 --> 15:58.509
I know, he's taking the elevator.

15:58.512 --> 16:00.346
No, he's just bending his knees.

16:00.380 --> 16:02.381
- Come on.
- Hey.

16:02.416 --> 16:04.183
Anyone could tell
that's what he was doing.

16:04.218 --> 16:05.485
Cranky mime.

16:11.291 --> 16:13.359
Ooh, that's nice.

16:13.393 --> 16:15.916
Oh, hey, Tate, can I get a turn on that?

16:16.530 --> 16:17.829
There's a sign-up sheet.

16:18.365 --> 16:21.267
Oh, it looks like
you've signed yourself up

16:21.301 --> 16:22.568
for the rest of the day.

16:22.603 --> 16:24.403
Well, there's no rule against it.

16:24.438 --> 16:27.740
I'm not gonna apologize for
taking advantage of a loophole.

16:27.923 --> 16:28.922
Makes me smart.

16:29.009 --> 16:30.676
Tate, get your ass out of my chair.

16:31.378 --> 16:32.917
What? It's all of our chair.

16:32.995 --> 16:34.881
No, actually, I bought the chair

16:34.915 --> 16:38.117
with the money I found
because I wanted everybody

16:38.152 --> 16:41.120
to be happy, including me.
So get out of my chair

16:41.155 --> 16:43.723
before I pull you out by your
greasy, little hair plugs.

16:43.757 --> 16:46.726
All right, all right,
I'm getting up, you psycho.

16:46.760 --> 16:47.616
Thank you.

16:48.462 --> 16:50.296
And threatening a
pharmacist, by the way?

16:50.330 --> 16:51.936
That's a felony. Probably.

16:52.466 --> 16:56.435
Oh, this is so nice.

16:56.470 --> 16:57.870
I'm relaxing now.

16:57.905 --> 16:58.868
I see that.

16:59.473 --> 17:01.107
Guess what. I found the guy

17:01.141 --> 17:02.575
who lost the $900.

17:06.587 --> 17:09.233
Whoa, it looks great in here.

17:09.536 --> 17:11.208
So I read the date of the receipt

17:11.209 --> 17:12.417
for the Arizona iced tea

17:12.768 --> 17:15.204
and remembered that I had
sold it seven months ago.

17:15.204 --> 17:18.205
Right, 'cause you have that awesome
memory where you don't forget anything.

17:18.241 --> 17:20.901
I have highly superior
autobiographical memory,

17:20.935 --> 17:22.569
- like Marilu Henner.
- Oh.

17:22.570 --> 17:24.175
Anyway, I remembered
selling the same man

17:24.176 --> 17:25.876
a pack of tube socks back on March 29th,

17:25.877 --> 17:28.835
so I searched the loyalty card
database and there he was.

17:29.212 --> 17:30.146
Stuart Mitchell.

17:31.527 --> 17:34.074
Thank you so much for calling me.

17:34.455 --> 17:37.323
I work with my church
counseling at-risk youth,

17:37.358 --> 17:39.225
and this was the money
I'd gotten together

17:39.260 --> 17:41.094
to organize a field trip to Peru.

17:41.128 --> 17:43.429
I'm sorry, I just think
it's a little suspicious

17:43.464 --> 17:45.398
that you have this perfect
excuse planned out

17:45.432 --> 17:48.034
for why you needed the money,
and it just so happens

17:48.068 --> 17:49.726
to make you look like a nice guy.

17:49.727 --> 17:52.662
Yeah, if the shorts are really yours,
what else was in the pockets?

17:52.696 --> 17:57.667
Oh, um, I think that day I'd taken
away a bit of a joint from one kid,

17:57.701 --> 18:00.002
and some dirty pictures
from another one.

18:00.037 --> 18:00.784
Nice.

18:00.816 --> 18:04.572
Then why don't you explain
the dip, huh? What about the dip?

18:05.293 --> 18:06.147
I use dip.

18:07.030 --> 18:08.073
That checks out.

18:10.068 --> 18:11.746
- It's a good try.
- Thank you.

18:13.035 --> 18:13.868
Can I just say?

18:13.902 --> 18:15.988
You guys have a really nice break room.

18:17.005 --> 18:18.634
- We did.
- Sure did.

18:26.503 --> 18:30.472
I know this is a weird time,
but my birthday's on Friday,

18:30.586 --> 18:32.219
and it's gonna be at Dave and Buster's.

18:34.923 --> 18:36.438
I'll just email you the details.

18:44.933 --> 18:45.572
Hey.

18:45.574 --> 18:46.361
Hey.

18:47.202 --> 18:47.788
What's wrong?

18:47.790 --> 18:50.337
Nothin', I'm cool. Just chillin'.

18:50.839 --> 18:51.543
So weird.

18:53.709 --> 18:54.909
You're the weird one!

18:54.943 --> 18:56.877
You're so weird
that nobody even can tell

18:56.912 --> 18:59.180
how weird you really are
'cause you make weird normal!

18:59.214 --> 19:01.215
If there was a day
that you acted normal,

19:01.249 --> 19:02.817
now that would be weird, right?

19:02.851 --> 19:05.145
Right? Oh, oh, okay.

19:05.286 --> 19:06.053
I'm the crazy one?

19:06.087 --> 19:08.770
Maybe so. I am yelling in public,

19:08.770 --> 19:11.118
which is not something I normally do,

19:11.118 --> 19:14.509
completely out of character,
possibly a little crazy!

19:14.543 --> 19:17.612
Can I help you, Turtleneck?
You need some help?

19:18.066 --> 19:20.608
Now, if anybody needs me,
I'll be in my car

19:20.608 --> 19:23.043
listening to yacht rock
and eating two Take 5s

19:23.076 --> 19:25.444
to calm myself down!

19:25.479 --> 19:26.642
Whoo!

19:40.594 --> 19:43.863
You know, some days you get the giraffe,

19:43.897 --> 19:45.392
some days you get the wig.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.018
I'm sorry?

19:47.052 --> 19:48.434
It's an expression.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.373
You haven't heard that?

19:51.690 --> 19:52.328
Okay.

19:56.101 --> 19:57.887
I mean, I did everything I could.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.530
Just some people just don't
want to be cheered up.

20:02.101 --> 20:04.168
Maybe it's just the time of year.

20:09.908 --> 20:11.935
Adam's sleeping in the basement.

20:13.879 --> 20:14.474
Yeah.

20:14.980 --> 20:16.962
I told him I wasn't happy.

20:18.150 --> 20:20.618
I don't know what I expected him to say,

20:20.653 --> 20:22.954
but he said, "I'm not happy either,"

20:22.988 --> 20:25.943
which is definitely not
what I expected him to say.

20:26.325 --> 20:29.961
And, so, we talked about it,
and then we yelled about it,

20:29.995 --> 20:31.902
and then we just stopped talking.

20:33.738 --> 20:35.805
And now it's all weird and tense

20:35.841 --> 20:39.653
and Emma's all upset
and it's just... it's miserable.

20:41.914 --> 20:44.518
Amy, I am so sorry.

20:49.272 --> 20:50.673
Do you want a balloon animal?

20:50.707 --> 20:53.221
