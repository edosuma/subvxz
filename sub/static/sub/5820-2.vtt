00:02.240 --> 00:04.766
Woman:
It says the ignition switch fuse

00:04.920 --> 00:06.524
is found at location
number 27.

00:06.680 --> 00:08.603
Man: All right, 27.
I need to know where that is.

00:08.760 --> 00:10.171
(woman sighs )

00:10.360 --> 00:13.125
Um, right here.

00:13.320 --> 00:15.448
Man: Yeah, okay,
this one's blown.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.045
What's this one,
the red one?

00:18.560 --> 00:20.927
( Snarling )

00:21.120 --> 00:22.849
Enid: Mom, Dad,
we got to go.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.202
- Man: Come on, come on.
- Woman: We see them.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.488
Just need to find a fuse
so we can start the car.

00:27.640 --> 00:29.449
Almost got it, honey.
Location six.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.807
That's turn signal lamps
and stop lamps.

00:31.960 --> 00:33.644
Man: All right, we can live
without turn signals.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.365
- ( Snarling )
- Dad, they're com--

00:35.520 --> 00:37.807
(thunder rumbling )

00:37.960 --> 00:40.167
(crying )

01:03.720 --> 01:05.722
( knife blade rings )

01:16.080 --> 01:19.402
( walkers snarling )

01:22.720 --> 01:25.690
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( <=ryin9 )

02:18.960 --> 02:21.088
( snarling )

02:26.400 --> 02:29.051
(thunder rumbling )

03:15.920 --> 03:18.605
(thunder rumbling )

04:04.240 --> 04:06.925
( distant people chatting )

04:09.400 --> 04:11.846
( laughter)

04:40.800 --> 04:43.929
( chatter continues )

05:22.920 --> 05:25.526
( gate squeaking )

05:38.200 --> 05:41.170
( theme music playing )

06:16.440 --> 06:18.204
Celery soup.

06:18.360 --> 06:19.930
It's been here
since the start.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.844
- You're very brave.
- ( chuckles )

06:22.000 --> 06:23.650
Well, I'm hoping
the paprika will mask

06:23.800 --> 06:25.609
the soup's celeryness.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.000
Shelly: Then you'd be stuck
with something

06:27.160 --> 06:28.605
that tastes
like paprika.

06:28.760 --> 06:30.444
No, thank you.

06:30.600 --> 06:32.921
Carol: Well, I just figured since
we're running low on staples,

06:33.120 --> 06:36.442
I'd try to use a few things
nobody seems to want.

06:38.160 --> 06:40.731
I used to make Ed these
spring cleaning casseroles

06:40.920 --> 06:43.526
just to empty the pan"!!-

06:43.680 --> 06:46.650
I made some miracles happen
with water chestnuts.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.731
Talk about miracles,
that recipe for cola canned ham.

06:50.880 --> 06:52.325
Mmm.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.768
Ms. Peletier, you are
an honest to goodness hero.

06:55.920 --> 06:57.729
( Chuckles )

06:59.160 --> 07:00.286
Ugh.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.130
Erin:
Something wrong, Shelly?

07:02.280 --> 07:05.363
It's just
those old noodles.

07:05.520 --> 07:09.047
I mean, I tell you, if someone would
just find me one of those machines,

07:09.240 --> 07:13.006
I swear we would all be eating like
we were on a tour of Tuscany.

07:15.680 --> 07:17.091
You know, Shel,
I could teach you

07:17.240 --> 07:19.811
how to make pasta
with your own two hands.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.446
But you'd have to promise
not to smoke in the house.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.364
It's just
a disgusting habit.

07:24.520 --> 07:26.648
And it kills you.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.569
If you ask me,
there are too many things

07:28.720 --> 07:30.643
trying to do that
already, right?

07:31.920 --> 07:33.604
Right.

07:40.760 --> 07:44.560
Your dad used to hit you and then
he got himself killed.

07:44.720 --> 07:48.566
It happened.
Now it's done.

07:48.720 --> 07:51.246
You live with it
or it eats you up.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.289
Go home.

08:12.360 --> 08:14.010
Ron.

08:20.120 --> 08:22.168
Ron.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.448
Can you come
down here?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.131
( Footsteps approach )

08:38.440 --> 08:39.929
No.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.726
- Ron.
- No, I don't want a haircut.

08:43.960 --> 08:45.724
Look, I just gave
myself one.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.126
All right?
It's all set up.

08:47.280 --> 08:49.044
Don't make me do it
again next week.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.645
Take off your hat.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.286
- This is bullshit.
- What did you just--

08:53.440 --> 08:55.442
This is just you
trying to talk to me.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.408
There are things
we need to talk about.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.051
There are things
that you need to learn.

09:03.200 --> 09:05.009
What, are you serious?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.160
What is it?
Do you-- do you blame me?

09:12.080 --> 09:14.651
Huh?
Do you actually blame me?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.567
Raise your left arm
above your head.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.925
You can't.
Tell me why.

09:24.120 --> 09:25.690
No.

09:27.720 --> 09:29.449
Your father
was dangerous.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.126
Rick is dangerous.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.884
He doesn't have anything
to do with this.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.443
What, is he your friend?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.527
Yeah,
he's my friend.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.330
We got some panels
to put up,

09:55.480 --> 09:58.006
but we don't have to wait
to start growing things.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.726
There will be
some sore backs and tired feet.

10:00.880 --> 10:03.611
That's how you know
you've put in a hard day's work.

10:13.440 --> 10:17.365
They found crates of these
at a nursery just a few miles out.

10:17.520 --> 10:20.126
Tomatoes, carrots,
you name it.

10:20.280 --> 10:22.681
We can plant them
right here.

10:22.840 --> 10:26.208
Just need to finish
the expansion

10:26.360 --> 10:29.284
and the wall
needs to go up.

10:29.480 --> 10:33.530
Reg wanted
this community to grow.

10:33.680 --> 10:35.887
You did, too.

10:36.040 --> 10:37.963
Has that changed?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.128
Everyone that's here
is here because of you.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.366
You need to show them
you're still here.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.284
It hams
my biscuits is all.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.250
And going by cubic feet,
the biggest building in the expansion

11:06.400 --> 11:08.209
and we're gonna
waste it on a church.

11:08.360 --> 11:10.249
Take out the benches,
that could be a lab,

11:10.400 --> 11:13.085
a machine shop, very least
a sweet-ass game room.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.481
Walled-in real estate
is at a premium here.

11:15.640 --> 11:17.369
Thumpers just
shouldn't get dibs.

11:17.520 --> 11:20.364
Well, maybe we share
the church, you know?

11:20.520 --> 11:21.760
Do all that stuff
on different days.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.365
Hams my biscuits?

11:23.520 --> 11:27.127
Hams my biscuits.
That's all I heard.

11:27.280 --> 11:29.521
I mean, I have no idea
what you said after that.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.126
- Going by cubic feet--
- I was kidding.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.524
Tara:
Are you okay, Dana?

11:36.680 --> 11:39.411
- It's Denise.
- Denise, I'm sorry.

11:39.560 --> 11:41.722
I'm okay.

11:41.880 --> 11:44.087
I'm the new doctor now.

11:44.240 --> 11:45.844
What's the aspirin for?

11:46.000 --> 11:49.004
- You're a doctor?
- Are you?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.891
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

11:52.040 --> 11:53.769
heard that story.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.410
Fair plaY-

11:55.560 --> 11:57.608
Listen, I'm a little
nervous here.

11:57.760 --> 11:59.683
I'm a psychiatrist.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.490
I went to med school.

12:01.640 --> 12:02.766
I was even gonna
be a surgeon,

12:02.920 --> 12:04.604
but after
the panic attacks,

12:04.760 --> 12:07.047
I got really interested
in psychology.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.767
And...
( laughs)

12:10.920 --> 12:13.605
I think I'm really trying
to lower expectations here.

12:13.760 --> 12:15.091
Can you do this?

12:15.240 --> 12:18.210
Eugene, shut up.
She can do this.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.930
I'm all this town's got.

12:20.080 --> 12:22.651
Pete didn't want me here.

12:22.840 --> 12:25.525
But I'm here now

12:25.720 --> 12:28.963
and I only kind of
want to throw up.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.884
So why the aspirin?

12:31.040 --> 12:34.283
Oh, Eugene and I were working on
a platform for another guard tower.

12:34.480 --> 12:37.051
I got a little dizzy.
You know, I still get headaches.

12:37.200 --> 12:38.690
Sit down,
I'll take a look.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.444
( Sighs )

12:45.600 --> 12:47.409
You're my first patient.

12:47.560 --> 12:51.531
And with that symptom,
I'm pretty sure I can't kill you.

12:51.680 --> 12:54.843
I mean, it is possible if you miss,
like, a hematoma or something.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.288
( Cooing )

13:18.760 --> 13:21.764
Carl?

13:21.920 --> 13:23.570
What?

13:24.920 --> 13:27.048
You heard what I told
Deanna about your group.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.720
What do you want?

13:29.880 --> 13:31.644
It was about me,

13:31.800 --> 13:35.327
not you
or your group.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.448
I know that now.

13:38.960 --> 13:40.564
I want to help.

13:40.720 --> 13:44.202
You tried to teach me
back at my church.

13:44.360 --> 13:47.569
But I'm ready
to learn now.

13:49.720 --> 13:52.200
I think you need
to tell everybody.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.888
Yeah, I think
you're right.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.809
Come by around 3:00.

14:03.960 --> 14:05.962
We'll start
with the machete.

14:46.000 --> 14:48.082
( Ticking )

15:05.040 --> 15:08.203
( screams )

15:08.360 --> 15:10.601
No!No!No!

15:15.160 --> 15:17.049
( People screaming )

15:19.400 --> 15:22.324
Richards.
What's going on in there?

15:22.520 --> 15:25.729
( Screaming )

15:25.880 --> 15:27.962
Oh, no.

15:28.120 --> 15:29.690
No.

15:39.880 --> 15:41.564
Come on!

15:48.520 --> 15:49.806
- ( Woman screams )
- I saw from upstairs.

15:49.960 --> 15:51.007
They're coming in
from all over.

15:51.160 --> 15:53.686
You have to stay here
and keep Judith safe.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.446
( People screaming )

15:58.720 --> 16:00.927
- Please don't go.
- I have to go find Ron.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.570
Oh, please.
Please don't go.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.882
- I'm gonna be right back, okay?
- Mom, no.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.769
No, you go put yourself
in the closet

16:06.920 --> 16:09.082
and you close the latch
just like I showed you.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.561
- ( Glass breaks )
- ( woman screams )

16:12.840 --> 16:15.571
Shh. Shh. Shh.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.930
- ( Glass shatters )
- ( cocks gun )

16:36.720 --> 16:37.767
( panting )

16:37.920 --> 16:39.410
(grunts)

16:41.400 --> 16:43.482
( doorknob rattling )

17:02.160 --> 17:03.525
Hi.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.603
Why didn't you
just knock?

17:05.760 --> 17:08.444
I have these.
Didn't want them to have them.

17:14.119 --> 17:15.770
And I wanted
to say good-bye.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.082
Okay, watch the back door.
Tell me if you see them coming.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.446
- I'm not staying.
- You're not going anywhere.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.689
Sit down. You're helping me
protect Judith.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.887
They're not getting
inside this house.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.563
We're not gonna let them.

17:38.960 --> 17:40.724
Did you see them?

17:41.960 --> 17:44.088
They're just people-

17:45.840 --> 17:49.083
This place
is too big to protect.

17:49.240 --> 17:52.005
There are too many
blind spots.

17:52.160 --> 17:54.003
That's how
we were able to--

17:54.160 --> 17:57.369
They got in the walls,
but they're gonna die.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.970
All of them.

18:04.800 --> 18:07.041
Don't tell me
good-bye.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.082
Okay.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.124
I won't.

18:31.040 --> 18:33.042
( People screaming )

19:06.400 --> 19:08.209
Erin:
No, please. Please don't.

19:08.360 --> 19:10.362
No, please.
Please...

19:10.520 --> 19:11.965
Go away!
( groans )

19:16.160 --> 19:20.210
(whimpering )
Oh, God.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.408
Shh.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.886
- ( Objects shattering )
- ( people screaming )

19:28.040 --> 19:32.090

- Shh. Shh.

( People screaming )

20:04.440 --> 20:05.930
(gunshot)

20:06.080 --> 20:07.889
Spencer:
Shit.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.805
Come on.
Come on.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.641
(gunshot)

20:18.120 --> 20:20.646

20:24.240 --> 20:26.607

21:02.120 --> 21:04.327
¢ ( dQQf opens )
' Holly!

21:04.480 --> 21:05.891
We need the operating
table prepped.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.691
She's lost a lot of blood.
Come on, come on, come on.

21:08.840 --> 21:11.366
- How many people are out there?
- I don't know, there's a lot.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.284
Rosita, you know
how to stick an IV?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.841
I'm on it.
Here, hand me tape.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.326
- Got it.
- What about the air horn?

21:17.480 --> 21:20.006
- What's happening?
- I don't know. I need to help.

21:20.160 --> 21:22.162
- I need to try.
- I know.

21:22.320 --> 21:25.005
Denise, I'm gonna
have to go, too.

21:26.440 --> 21:27.726
So do I.

21:27.880 --> 21:29.450
You got dizzy
swinging a hammer.

21:29.640 --> 21:30.766
Somebody's got
to guard this place.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.729
- You can handle it.
- I can't!

21:32.880 --> 21:35.042
I also believe my services would be
best rendered right very here.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.964
- What?
- I also believe my services--

21:37.120 --> 21:38.884
Shut up!
You're safe here. Come on.

21:42.640 --> 21:44.802
( People screaming )

21:48.400 --> 21:50.368
( horn blaring )

21:54.040 --> 21:56.771
( snarling )

22:10.800 --> 22:12.165
( horn stops )

22:14.040 --> 22:15.371
What happened?

22:15.560 --> 22:18.769
Someone, a group,
they got inside the walls.

22:18.920 --> 22:20.445
They're killing people.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.728
We need
to get in there.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.090
You coming?

22:31.040 --> 22:32.565
Hide.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.045
Quick...

22:58.000 --> 22:59.650
or slow?

23:01.480 --> 23:03.687
Leave.

23:03.840 --> 23:05.365
Please.

23:07.640 --> 23:09.483
Gonna be slow.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.481
( Groans )

23:18.080 --> 23:19.241
I could have stopped him.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.368
- The others back?
- No.

23:21.520 --> 23:23.488
- It's happening out there.
- They're doing it now?

23:23.640 --> 23:25.483
We had to.

23:25.640 --> 23:28.484
- These people don't have guns.
- I could have stopped him.

23:28.640 --> 23:30.165
If they had guns,
they'd be using them.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.321
Did you hear me?

23:31.480 --> 23:33.482
We have to get to the armory
before they do.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.081
If we keep moving,
this might work.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.571
You don't have
to kill people.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.929
- Of course we do.
- Carol!

23:41.080 --> 23:43.401
You don't like it.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.524
I'm gonna get to the armory
and I need your help.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.525
Spencer:
Mom!

23:56.680 --> 23:58.842
Oh, God.
Spencer.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.203
Thank God.

24:02.360 --> 24:04.362
We need to get inside.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.126
I can't go in there.
I don't have a gun.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.725
I don't know
how to fight.

24:08.920 --> 24:12.481
If I go inside, I'll just be another
person who's got to be saved.

24:12.640 --> 24:16.725
Best thing that I can do
for everyone in there

24:16.880 --> 24:19.201
is to stay out here.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.603
- Keep her safe.
- I will.

24:36.960 --> 24:40.407
( People screaming )

24:42.120 --> 24:45.602
( screaming echoes )

24:53.400 --> 24:55.289
- Tara: What's happening with her?
- ( machine beeping )

24:55.440 --> 24:57.681
She's bleeding
internally.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.969
Probably severed
her femoral artery.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.963
She's dying.

25:03.120 --> 25:05.600
Okay, so the artery's severed.
Can it be fixed?

25:05.760 --> 25:07.683
Maybe by a surgeon.

25:07.840 --> 25:09.251
You were gonna
be a surgeon.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.680
But I'm not.

25:10.840 --> 25:12.842
She was protecting
this place.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.924
She was guarding us.
That's why we're here, for each other.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.007
You're afraid?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.521
I don't care.
Help her.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.969
Try!
Help her!

25:27.120 --> 25:29.282
( Monitor beeping )

25:29.440 --> 25:31.568
You don't want
to be a coward.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.882
I know.

25:42.120 --> 25:44.168
I need an abdominal binder.
We're gonna pull the knife.

25:44.320 --> 25:45.970
Okay. Okay.

25:46.120 --> 25:48.487
( People screaming )

Shit!

26:11.880 --> 26:14.611
Please, man.
Please don't kill me, man.

26:14.800 --> 26:17.531
Please. Help me, please.
My leg.

26:21.760 --> 26:23.410
(gunshot)

26:29.440 --> 26:31.681
Come inside.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.330
I can keep you safe.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.369
( Panting )

26:39.840 --> 26:41.683
No.

27:01.800 --> 27:04.644
- Mom, you in?
- ( footsteps depart)

27:11.880 --> 27:14.121
Lock it.
Be brave.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.049

Good catch, Aphid.

28:45.360 --> 28:47.488
Come on.
Leave him.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.324
No.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.643
Hey, Aphid,
where'd you get the gun?

( Gunshots )

29:00.560 --> 29:02.210

29:57.600 --> 29:59.045
Please don't kill me.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.883
It's okay.
Anybody else down here?

30:06.640 --> 30:08.449
- Olivia!
- No.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.568
No, I'm the only one.

30:16.720 --> 30:18.484
Come here.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.324
Now.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.887
You barricade
that door behind me once I leave.

30:25.040 --> 30:27.247
Do you know
how to shoot a gun?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.004
Stand here.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.447
Finger here.
Aim there.

30:31.640 --> 30:33.210
One of them comes
through that door,

30:33.360 --> 30:35.567
you squeeze and you
don't stop till they're on the ground.

30:46.840 --> 30:48.524
How did you learn
how to do that?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.527
From a cheese maker.

30:58.800 --> 31:00.689
We're freeing you.

31:00.840 --> 31:02.968
You're trapped.

They may be aiming rifles
at you right now.

choosing this life,
