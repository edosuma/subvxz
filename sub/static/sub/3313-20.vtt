WEBVTT

00:08.008 --> 00:09.340
"MELISSA AND JOEY" IS RECORDED IN
FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:12.043 --> 00:13.643
WHY ARE YOU IN EXERCISE CLOTHES?

00:13.644 --> 00:16.746
I WAS EXERCISING.

00:16.747 --> 00:19.549
NO, SERIOUSLY, WAS
EVERYTHING ELSE DIRTY?

00:19.550 --> 00:23.093
I JUST DID THE CARDI-YOGA CLASS
IN THE PARK DOWN THE STREET.

00:23.094 --> 00:25.525
WAS THAT SOME KIND OF
COURT-ORDERED PUNISHMENT?

00:25.526 --> 00:28.258
CAN'T SOMEONE JUST EXERCISE
BECAUSE IT'S GOOD FOR THEM?

00:28.259 --> 00:29.559
ALL RIGHT, ALL
RIGHT, MISS EYEBROW.

00:29.560 --> 00:32.362
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO
AT A CHARITY AUCTION,

00:32.363 --> 00:34.704
I PAID FOR A TEN-COURSE
GOURMET MEAL

00:34.705 --> 00:36.666
AT THE UBER TRENDY
RESTAURANT 13 TABLES.

00:36.667 --> 00:39.339
MY PLAN IS TO SAVOR EVERY
BITE TOTALLY GUILT-FREE

00:39.340 --> 00:42.612
BECAUSE I WILL HAVE BURNED OFF
ALL THE CALORIES IN ADVANCE.

00:42.613 --> 00:44.814
ACTUALLY, THAT'S PRETTY CLEVER.

00:44.815 --> 00:47.717
HEY, THIS IS MORE THAN
JUST A PRETTY PICTURE.

00:47.718 --> 00:49.649
13 TABLES, THAT'S THE RESTAURANT

00:49.650 --> 00:51.251
WITH CELEBRITY CHEF
WHAT'S-HIS-NAME?

00:51.252 --> 00:52.622
YEAH, MALCOLM SUNDERLAND.

00:52.623 --> 00:56.126
OH, JUST SAYING HIS NAME
MAKES MY MOUTH WATER.

00:56.127 --> 00:58.788
AND ISN'T HIS PLACE FAMOUS
FOR ITS FLAMING CHEESE?

00:58.789 --> 01:01.231
YES, THEY HAVE CHEESE AND FIRE.

01:01.232 --> 01:03.634
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE A LAS
VEGAS SHOW FOR YOUR MOUTH.

01:04.735 --> 01:06.736
AND JOE AND I GET TO
ENJOY A ROMANTIC DINNER

01:06.737 --> 01:09.669
AT THE CHEF'S TABLE RIGHT
INSIDE THE KITCHEN.

01:09.670 --> 01:12.242
WOW, THEY LET YOU
SIT IN THE KITCHEN?

01:12.243 --> 01:14.244
MAYBE FOR ANOTHER $200,

01:14.245 --> 01:15.705
HE'LL LET YOU WASH THE DISHES.

01:15.706 --> 01:17.807
IT'S CHEF SUNDERLAND, OKAY?

01:17.808 --> 01:19.349
I WOULD PAY TO
LICK THOSE DISHES.

01:19.350 --> 01:22.482
MEL, WHAT IS UP?

01:22.483 --> 01:23.713
I WAS JUST RUNNING BY
THE PARK AND I SAW YOU

01:23.714 --> 01:25.215
STANDING THERE WITH A
BUNCH OF STRANGERS

01:25.216 --> 01:26.486
DOING SOME HALF-ASS
JUMPING JACKS.

01:26.487 --> 01:29.419
THOSE ARE JUMPING JILLS,
AND JUMPING IS OPTIONAL.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.322
YEAH, THEN I SAW YOU TAKE A NAP.

01:32.323 --> 01:33.663
OH, THAT'S SAVASANA.

01:33.664 --> 01:36.796
IT'S MY FAVORITE PART.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.698
YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT
THE BEST EXERCISE?

01:38.699 --> 01:40.330
SLEEPING.

01:40.331 --> 01:42.672
YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE A BUNCH OF
CIVIL WAR RE-ENACTORS IN LYCRA.

01:42.673 --> 01:44.534
WHY ARE YOU GUYS ALL GIVING ME

01:44.535 --> 01:45.705
A HARD TIME ABOUT EXERCISING?

01:45.706 --> 01:47.407
I'M NOT. I'M ACTUALLY
GIVING YOU A HARD TIME

01:47.408 --> 01:49.139
ABOUT HIRING SOME STRANGER
TO BE YOUR TRAINER

01:49.140 --> 01:51.441
WHEN YOU COULD'VE HIRED THE SAME
AMAZING TRAINER THAT I USE.

01:51.442 --> 01:53.143
YOU KNOW?

01:53.144 --> 01:54.784
ME.

01:54.785 --> 01:55.815
THANKS FOR THE OFFER.

01:55.816 --> 01:57.317
NO NO, SERIOUSLY. COME ON.

01:57.318 --> 01:59.419
THIS COULD BE ANOTHER
FUN COUPLE'S ACTIVITY

01:59.420 --> 02:00.690
THAT WE COULD DO
TOGETHER, YOU KNOW?

02:00.691 --> 02:02.352
FINDING NEW AND INTERESTING WAYS

02:02.353 --> 02:03.823
TO RAISE OUR HEART
RATES UNTIL WE'RE BOTH

02:03.824 --> 02:06.526
GRUNTING AND SWEATING
LIKE ANIMALS.

02:06.527 --> 02:08.158
OKAY, THAT'S MY CUE TO LEAVE.

02:08.159 --> 02:10.230
WAIT, I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
US TO GET TOGETHER.

02:10.231 --> 02:12.732
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T
WANT A FRONT-ROW SEAT.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.665
LOOK, JOE, I JUST THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

02:15.666 --> 02:16.736
TO KEEP OUR PERSONAL LIVES

02:16.737 --> 02:18.368
AND OUR EXERCISE LIVES SEPARATE.

02:18.369 --> 02:19.439
WHAT? WHY?

02:19.440 --> 02:20.510
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANT YOU SEEING ME

02:20.511 --> 02:22.212
ALL SWEATY AND NASTY.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.444
( chuckles ) TOO
LATE FOR THAT, BABY.

02:24.445 --> 02:26.616
ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY. JUST
GIVE ME A RUNNING START.

AS YOUR TRAINER.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.342
- OKAY?
- OH, MAY I?

02:52.343 --> 02:53.743
BUT YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

02:53.744 --> 02:55.345
- I'LL LEARN TO LIVE WITH THAT.
- ALL RIGHT, FINE.

02:55.346 --> 02:56.646
- I'LL DROP IT.
- GREAT.

02:56.647 --> 02:58.778
- AFTER I MAKE ONE LAST POINT.
- OKAY, SEE,

02:58.779 --> 02:59.809
THIS IS NOT DROPPING IT.

02:59.810 --> 03:02.552
THIS IS THROWING IT...
PING... IN MY FACE.

03:02.553 --> 03:03.913
I'M JUST SAYING, I'VE
BEEN SPENDING YEARS

03:03.914 --> 03:05.955
DEVELOPING AN AMAZING
EXERCISE PROGRAM, OKAY.

03:05.956 --> 03:07.857
I KNOW WHAT WORKS BECAUSE...

03:07.858 --> 03:09.719
WELL, BECAUSE HERE ARE
TWO REASONS, OKAY?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.721
ONE...

03:11.722 --> 03:13.923
AND, UH, TWO...

03:13.924 --> 03:16.466
THAT'S NOT AS HOT
AS YOU THINK IT IS.

03:16.467 --> 03:19.729
LOOK, I'M JUST SAYING I
KNOW WHAT WORKS ON ME

03:19.730 --> 03:21.801
BECAUSE I'M HARD WORKING
AND I'M DEDICATED,

03:21.802 --> 03:23.733
BUT IT WOULD REALLY
BE INTERESTING TO SEE

03:23.734 --> 03:26.707
IF IT WORKED ON SOMEBODY WHO WAS
ALMOST COMPLETELY SEDENTARY.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.610
BUT... BUT WHO... WHO...
WHO MAKES THAT

03:30.611 --> 03:32.442
LOOK VERY SEXY.

03:32.443 --> 03:36.546
YOU KNOW, THIS SYSTEM OF YOURS,
DO YOU HAVE A NAME FOR IT?

03:36.547 --> 03:38.318
- LET ME GUESS.
- NO NO, DON'T TRY AND GUESS,

03:38.319 --> 03:40.490
OKAY, BECAUSE IT'S TAKEN ME,
LIKE, YEARS TO COME UP WITH

03:40.491 --> 03:41.521
THE PERFECT NAME.

03:41.522 --> 03:43.653
LONGO FIT?

03:43.654 --> 03:46.596
DID YOU PEEK IN MY DIARY?

03:46.597 --> 03:47.858
YOU KEEP A DIARY?

03:49.530 --> 03:52.362
NO.

03:52.363 --> 03:55.305
LOOK, JOE, I'M HAPPY WITH MY CLASS
IN THE PARK WITH MY FRIENDS.

03:55.306 --> 03:56.966
OKAY, I'M SURE IT'S NOT
AS INTENSE AS YOURS.

03:56.967 --> 03:58.308
AND I KNOW YOU DO A GREAT JOB,

03:58.309 --> 04:00.770
BUT, JUST, I LIKE HAVING FUN.

04:00.771 --> 04:03.713
OH OH, I SEE.

04:03.714 --> 04:05.315
SO YOU DON'T THINK THAT
DOING SOMETHING WITH ME

04:05.316 --> 04:07.517
AS A COUPLE WOULD
QUALIFY TO YOU AS FUN.

04:07.518 --> 04:09.479
- I DIDN'T MEANT THAT.
- IT'S WHAT YOU SAID, ISN'T IT?

04:09.480 --> 04:10.680
OH, COME ON.

04:10.681 --> 04:11.981
DON'T LOOK SO SAD.

04:11.982 --> 04:13.623
- LET ME PUNCH YOU IN THE STOMACH.
- NO.

04:13.624 --> 04:16.687
DON'T TRY AND CHEER ME UP.

04:17.988 --> 04:20.331
( "Cassandra" theme song plays )

04:22.262 --> 04:23.993
Zander: YOU REALLY THINK SOMEONE'S
GONNA SHELL OUT REAL MONEY

04:23.994 --> 04:25.264
FOR OUR LITTLE WEB SERIES?

04:25.265 --> 04:26.866
ABSOLUTELY.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.038
BUT WE WON'T KNOW FOR
SURE UNTIL WE HIT SEND.

04:29.039 --> 04:30.540
WHOA, OKAY, YOU KNOW...

04:30.541 --> 04:33.403
IT'S JUST THAT SENDING
IT OFF TO BE JUDGED

04:33.404 --> 04:35.775
BY THE EDITORS OF THE
WORLD'S COOLEST WEBSITES...

04:35.776 --> 04:37.006
THAT MAKE YOU NERVOUS?

04:37.007 --> 04:38.708
NOPE.

04:38.709 --> 04:40.410
OH, YOU DID IT. YOU JUST...

04:40.411 --> 04:41.781
YOU JUST DID IT.
YOU JUST HIT SEND.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.513
IT'LL BE OKAY.

04:43.514 --> 04:46.486
ALL RIGHT, IT WAS TIME TO SEND
OUR BABY OUT INTO THE WORLD.

04:46.487 --> 04:47.857
OKAY, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:47.858 --> 04:50.720
YOU KNOW, I JUST FEEL
REALLY GOOD ABOUT THIS.

04:50.721 --> 04:51.921
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT OUR WEB SHOW

04:51.922 --> 04:53.062
OR US BEING BACK TOGETHER?

04:53.063 --> 04:54.725
ALL OF IT.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.929
AW, LOOK AT YOU LOVEBIRDS.

04:59.930 --> 05:00.970
YOU WOULD NEVER KNOW
THAT ONE OF YOU

05:00.971 --> 05:02.602
IS ABOUT TO FLY FAR FAR AWAY

05:02.603 --> 05:03.733
TO ART SCHOOL IN VERMONT.

05:03.734 --> 05:06.406
OH, 700 MILES FROM HERE.
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:06.407 --> 05:07.737
YOU ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING,

05:07.738 --> 05:09.380
ENJOYING IT WHILE YOU CAN.

05:12.743 --> 05:15.786

05:17.418 --> 05:18.948
HEY, WERE YOU SERIOUS
THE OTHER DAY

05:18.949 --> 05:20.049
WHEN YOU SAID YOU
COULD DO A BETTER JOB

05:20.050 --> 05:21.691
TEACHING MY EXERCISE CLASS?

05:21.692 --> 05:23.793

05:28.729 --> 05:30.660
WELL, OUR REGULAR
TEACHER HAD A LITTLE...

05:30.661 --> 05:33.463
A BENCH-WARRANT-FOR-ARREST
THINGY.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.004
- SAY WHAT?
- WELL, IT TURNS OUT,

05:35.005 --> 05:36.836
SOME OF HIS CLIENTS'
AMAZING RESULTS

05:36.837 --> 05:37.907
WERE DUE IN PART
TO HIM PERFORMING

05:37.908 --> 05:40.740
LIPOSUCTION WITHOUT A LICENSE.

05:40.741 --> 05:42.341
WOW, WE'VE GOTTEN TO THAT POINT

05:42.342 --> 05:44.744
WHERE YOU CAN'T EVEN TRUST
STRANGERS IN THE PARK ANYMORE.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.816
HEY, EVERYBODY. THIS IS JOE.

05:46.817 --> 05:47.947
- Women: HEY.

05:47.948 --> 05:49.749
- FIND A SPOT.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.820
WHY DID YOU BRING THEM TO ME?

05:50.821 --> 05:52.351
WELL, THEY'RE DRESSED
AND READY FOR CLASS.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.024
I FIGURED WHY NOT GIVE JOE
LONGO A SHOT AS A TRAINER.

05:55.025 --> 05:57.457
THANK YOU. HEY, THIS
MEANS A LOT TO ME.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.730
UH, LADIES, OKAY.

06:00.731 --> 06:04.464
WELCOME TO LONGO FIT.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.566

SEE YA.

06:12.643 --> 06:13.803
WAIT WAIT WAIT.

06:13.804 --> 06:15.645
AREN'T YOU GONNA
STAY AND WORK OUT?

06:15.646 --> 06:16.876
WELL, YEAH, I'M GONNA WORK OUT.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.410
JUST... IT'S TIME FOR
MY MORNING SAVASANA.

06:21.512 --> 06:23.152
MEL, UM, IT'S NOT EXACTLY

06:23.153 --> 06:24.383
A RINGING ENDORSEMENT
OF MY CLASS

06:24.384 --> 06:25.655
IF YOU DON'T STAY.

06:25.656 --> 06:27.787
I MEAN, IT WOULD JUST...

06:27.788 --> 06:29.789
MEAN THE WORLD TO ME
IF YOU WOULD BE HERE.

06:29.790 --> 06:32.892
OKAY, IF YOU'RE GONNA
PLAY THE GUILT CARD,

06:32.893 --> 06:35.895
I GUESS I COULD BE YOUR
VOLUPTUOUS SPOKESMODEL.

06:35.896 --> 06:39.168
OKAY, HERE WE GO, LADIES.

06:51.942 --> 06:53.543
I CAN'T DO ANYMORE.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.485

SERGEANT LONGO TELLS YOU

06:56.887 --> 06:58.548
WHEN YOU CAN AND
CAN'T DO ANYMORE.

06:58.549 --> 06:59.949
HEY, SERGE, HOW ABOUT
A WATER BREAK?

06:59.950 --> 07:01.851
FINE. WATER BREAK, EVERYBODY.

07:01.852 --> 07:02.753
30 SECONDS.

07:02.754 --> 07:04.694
HEY, WATER ONLY. NO SNACKS.

07:04.695 --> 07:05.725

07:13.003 --> 07:15.465
I THINK LONGO FIT COULD
REALLY BE A BUSINESS.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.436
YEAH, MAYBE, YOU KNOW,

07:17.437 --> 07:19.438
IF YOU EASE UP A LITTLE BIT.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.610
WHAT? COME ONE.

07:20.611 --> 07:21.741
THESE WOMEN LOVE WHAT I'M DOING.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.974
I THOUGHT CHILD BIRTH HURT.

07:24.975 --> 07:26.616
YOU'RE KILLING HER.

07:26.617 --> 07:27.877
SHE'S FINE.

07:27.878 --> 07:29.019
YO, WALK IT OFF!

07:30.120 --> 07:31.481
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WE'RE BACK IN.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.638
SORRY, SERGEANT LONGO.

07:48.639 --> 07:49.769
I'LL DO BETTER.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.741
YOU KNOW HE'S NOT A REAL
DRILL SERGEANT, RIGHT?

07:51.742 --> 07:53.903
HE'S MORE LIKE CAPTAIN CRUNCH.

07:53.904 --> 07:56.005
HEY, NO TALKING, ALL RIGHT?

07:56.006 --> 07:57.947
COME ON! 30 SECONDS, LADIES.

ONLY IF YOU WANT TO, SWEETIE.

08:00.751 --> 08:02.852
YOU KNOW WHAT,
TANDY, MEL'S RIGHT.

08:02.853 --> 08:04.854
WHY DON'T YOU JUST RELAX
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY?

08:04.855 --> 08:07.486
SEE, YOU CAN BE A
SERGEANT WITH HEART.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.858
YEAH, THE REST OF THE
CLASS WILL MAKE UP FOR IT

08:08.859 --> 08:10.790
BY DOING AN EXTRA 60
SECONDS OF JUMP SQUATS!

08:10.791 --> 08:12.622
- ( groaning )
- EVERYBODY ELSE IS IN.

08:12.623 --> 08:14.694
YOU CAN'T DO THAT. THAT'S
COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT.

08:14.695 --> 08:15.865
OH, SO YOU'RE FINALLY
STARTING TO REALIZE

08:15.866 --> 08:16.966
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.928
LET'S GO, LADIES. COME ON.

08:18.929 --> 08:20.800
THERE'S NO BREAKS. LET'S GO.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.502
- ( music stops )
- LOOK, NONE OF YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

08:23.503 --> 08:25.104
HEY, MEL, IF YOU KEEP
BEING DISRUPTIVE,

08:25.105 --> 08:26.275
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

08:26.276 --> 08:28.678
LADIES, JUST EVERYBODY
GO AT YOUR OWN PACE.

08:28.679 --> 08:29.979
OKAY, THAT'S IT. YOU'RE OUT.

08:29.980 --> 08:31.781
WHAT? YOU WOULDN'T KICK
OUT YOUR OWN GIRLFRIEND.

08:31.782 --> 08:33.042
I JUST DID.

08:33.043 --> 08:35.044
- ( music resumes )
- SEE YOU.

08:35.045 --> 08:37.046
OKAY, THESE WOMEN,
THEY CAME IN WITH ME

08:37.047 --> 08:38.047
AND THEY'RE GONNA LEAVE WITH ME.

08:38.048 --> 08:39.119
RIGHT, LADIES?

08:40.991 --> 08:42.692
WELL, THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.554
ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
WE'RE BACK IN.

08:44.555 --> 08:46.796
JUMP SQUATS, LET'S GO.
LET'S MAKE A CHANGE.

08:46.797 --> 08:48.729
I HAVE DONUTS IN THE KITCHEN.

08:51.231 --> 08:54.804
WHAT KIND OF SAD, BROKEN PEOPLE
CHOOSE SQUATS OVER DONUTS?

08:54.805 --> 08:56.867
COME ON. COME ON.

09:04.044 --> 09:06.275
RYDER, OUR DEAL WAS YOU CAN
GO TO THE MUSIC FESTIVAL

09:06.276 --> 09:07.677
IF YOU CHECKED IN TWICE A DAY.

09:07.678 --> 09:09.248
INSTAGRAMING A
PICTURE OF TWO GIRLS

09:09.249 --> 09:11.881
WRESTLING IN THE MUD
DOES NOT COUNT.

09:11.882 --> 09:13.222
CALL ME BACK IN
THREE HOURS, OKAY?

09:13.223 --> 09:14.624
I'LL BE HERE ALL NIGHT.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.325
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO THIS
FANCY RESTAURANT WITH JOE,

09:16.326 --> 09:17.987
BUT THEN HE KICKED ME OUT
OF HIS EXERCISE CLASS

09:17.988 --> 09:19.558
AND NOW WE'RE IN
THIS HUGE FIGHT.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.560
- ( phone beeps )
- AND I... HELLO?

09:21.561 --> 09:25.996
OKAY, I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE
HIS BATTERY JUST DIED.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.238
NO, YOU HANG UP FIRST.

09:29.239 --> 09:31.901
- ( phone beeps )
- HELLO?

09:31.902 --> 09:35.044
HE HUNG UP ON ME.

09:35.045 --> 09:38.608
AW, I LOVE THAT ZANDER
HATES COUPLE CLICHES.

09:38.609 --> 09:39.749
OH, WE'VE BEEN TALKING.

09:39.750 --> 09:40.880
AND WE DECIDED THAT
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

09:40.881 --> 09:42.111
A LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP.

09:42.112 --> 09:43.312
GOOD FOR YOU.

09:43.313 --> 09:44.914
YOU GUYS MIGHT BE THE
ONES TO MAKE IT WORK.

09:44.915 --> 09:46.756
UH, WAIT.

09:46.757 --> 09:48.287
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WE
MIGHT BE THE ONES"?

09:48.288 --> 09:50.860
HONEY, LOOK, THE THING ABOUT
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS

09:50.861 --> 09:52.591
IS THAT SOMETIMES THEY...

09:52.592 --> 09:54.263
NEVER WORK.

09:54.264 --> 09:55.925
- NEVER?!
- WELL, LOOK, LENNOX.

09:55.926 --> 09:56.996
EVERYBODY PLANS ON STAYING

09:56.997 --> 09:58.597
WITH THEIR HIGH
SCHOOL SWEETHEART,

09:58.598 --> 09:59.829
BUT THEN THE NEXT THING YOU
KNOW, YOU'RE AT COLLEGE

09:59.830 --> 10:02.371
AND THE OLDER GUYS ASK YOU
TO THIS REALLY COOL PARTY,

10:02.372 --> 10:03.602
AND THE NEXT THING YOU
KNOW, YOU'RE UPSIDE DOWN.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.774
THEN THE REST OF
THE FRESHMAN YEAR,

10:04.775 --> 10:07.076
EVERYBODY'S CALLING
YOU THE KEG QUEEN.

10:07.077 --> 10:10.109
AUNT MEL, I DON'T THINK
I'LL EVER BE KEG QUEEN.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.742
WELL, NOT WITH THAT
ATTITUDE YOU WON'T.

10:13.043 --> 10:14.113
SERIOUSLY, THOUGH, LOOK,

10:14.114 --> 10:15.614
COLLEGE IS A WHOLE NEW WORLD.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.016
AND YOU BECOME A
DIFFERENT PERSON.

10:17.017 --> 10:20.089
AND HIGH SCHOOL RELATIONSHIPS
TEND NOT TO SURVIVE THAT.

10:20.090 --> 10:21.991
UGH, WHO AM I KIDDING?

10:21.992 --> 10:23.993
YOU'RE RIGHT. ZANDER
AND I ARE DOOMED!

10:23.994 --> 10:25.354
NO NO NO!

10:25.355 --> 10:27.256
LOOK, MAYBE THE RULES DON'T
APPLY TO YOU AND ZANDER.

10:27.257 --> 10:29.628
LOOK, YOU JUST PLAYED THAT
YOU-HANG-UP-FIRST GAME.

10:29.629 --> 10:30.900
AND HE IMMEDIATELY
HUNG UP ON YOU.

10:30.901 --> 10:33.362
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE ARTISTS.

10:33.363 --> 10:34.904
YOU'LL MAKE UP YOUR OWN RULES.

10:34.905 --> 10:36.365
IT KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE
YOU'RE TRYING TO LAMELY

10:36.366 --> 10:38.307
WEASEL YOUR WAY OUT OF
AN AWKWARD CONVERSATION.

10:38.308 --> 10:40.009
LIKE I WOULD DO THAT.

10:40.010 --> 10:42.371
OOH, YOU KNOW, IT IS
SMOKE-DETECTOR-AWARENESS MONTH.

10:42.372 --> 10:44.074
I SHOULD CHECK SOME BATTERIES.

10:46.316 --> 10:48.647
( whistles )

10:48.648 --> 10:50.379
WHAT ARE YOU ALL DRESSED UP FOR?

10:50.380 --> 10:51.751
OUR BIG DATE TONIGHT?
WAIT A MINUTE,

10:51.752 --> 10:52.782
THAT CAN'T BE WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING.

10:52.783 --> 10:55.324
AND WHAT... YOU'RE
EATING A SANDWICH?!

10:55.325 --> 10:57.356
WE GOT TEN GOURMET COURSES
COMING OUR WAY TONIGHT,

10:57.357 --> 10:59.258
ONE OF WHICH IS FLAMING CHEESE.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.429
WE CAN'T GO ON A ROMANTIC DATE.

11:00.430 --> 11:01.991
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A HUGE FIGHT.

11:01.992 --> 11:04.433
WE ARE?

11:04.434 --> 11:05.434
YOU DIDN'T KNOW?!

11:05.435 --> 11:07.036
NOBODY TOLD ME.

11:07.037 --> 11:08.838
YOU KICKED ME OUT OF
YOUR EXERCISE CLASS.

11:08.839 --> 11:10.439
WHAT? I DIDN'T KICK
YOU OUT OF THERE.

11:10.440 --> 11:11.901
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO
BE THERE, COME ON.

11:11.902 --> 11:13.272
AND THEN YOU TRIED TO
START THAT LITTLE MUTINY

11:13.273 --> 11:14.373
WITH DONUTS, BUT LOOK...

11:14.374 --> 11:16.275
LET'S JUST PUT ALL
THAT ASIDE, ALL RIGHT,

11:16.276 --> 11:17.807
AND GO ENJOY THIS
AMAZING DINNER.

11:17.808 --> 11:19.448
BUT THAT THERE HASN'T
EVEN BEEN AN APOLOGY.

11:19.449 --> 11:22.281
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M GONNA
TAKE CARE OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

11:22.282 --> 11:25.855
OKAY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

11:25.856 --> 11:28.187
OH, APOLOGIZE YOU TO YOU?

11:28.188 --> 11:29.919
NO, YOU NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO ME.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.090
THIS IS ACTUALLY STARTING

11:31.091 --> 11:32.221
TO SEEM LIKE A LITTLE
BIT OF A FIGHT NOW.

11:32.222 --> 11:34.423
YEAH, IT'S BEEN ONE FOR SOME TIME.
KEEP UP.

11:34.424 --> 11:36.065
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
HONEY HONEY, LOOK LOOK...

11:36.066 --> 11:37.967
YOU SPENT A LOT OF MONEY
ON THIS DINNER TONIGHT.

11:37.968 --> 11:39.268
OKAY, ALL I'M SAYING IS

11:39.269 --> 11:41.200
LET'S JUST PUT OUR DIFFERENCES
OF OPINION ON HOLD,

11:41.201 --> 11:45.004
OKAY? GO OUT, ENJOY
TEN AMAZING COURSES,

11:45.005 --> 11:46.275
THEN WE CAN COME BACK HOME
AND PICK THIS FIGHT UP

11:46.276 --> 11:48.007
RIGHT WHERE WE LEFT OFF.
'CAUSE I HAVE A HUNCH

11:48.008 --> 11:50.409
SOMEONE'S GONNA REMEMBER
EXACTLY WHERE THAT WAS.

11:50.410 --> 11:53.813
SO YOU JUST WANT TO IGNORE
OUR FEELINGS FOR FOUR HOURS?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.414
NO NO. NOT IGNORE.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.987
PUT THEM ASIDE...

11:57.988 --> 12:01.851
TO MAKE ROOM FOR FLAMING CHEESE.

12:01.852 --> 12:03.192
SAY IT AGAIN.

12:03.193 --> 12:07.927
FLAMING CHEESE.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.430
WHAT FIGHT?

12:14.404 --> 12:16.135
YOU KNOW, MEL, I
HAVE TO TELL YOU.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.306
I'M REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU
SPENT A LOT OF MONEY

12:17.307 --> 12:18.337
AND WON THAT CHARITY
AUCTION THING

12:18.338 --> 12:20.870
BECAUSE I THINK TONIGHT'S DINNER

12:20.871 --> 12:22.371
IS GONNA BE VERY SPECIAL.

12:22.372 --> 12:24.043
MM-HMM, I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT ELSE IS SPECIAL,

12:24.044 --> 12:27.046
GETTING KICKED OUT OF MY OWN
GARAGE FOR TRYING TO HELP YOU.

12:27.047 --> 12:29.518
SEE, I KNEW YOU
COULD SET IT ASIDE.

12:29.519 --> 12:31.380
HAVE YOU DECIDED ON THE WINE?

12:31.381 --> 12:33.352
- YES.
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BOTTLE OF

12:33.353 --> 12:35.985
THE 2012 IL GOMITO.

12:35.986 --> 12:38.387
WELL, NO NEED FOR
ME TO WEIGH IN.

12:38.388 --> 12:41.460
YOUR OPINION IS JUST GOOD
ENOUGH FOR EVERYBODY.

12:41.461 --> 12:44.363
YOU KNOW WHAT? I
JUST FIGURED IT OUT.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.065
IT JUST HIT ME.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.336
YEAH, FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS,

12:47.337 --> 12:49.098
YOU'VE BEEN THE ONE
CALLING ALL THE SHOTS.

12:49.099 --> 12:50.369
AND TODAY, IN MY CLASS,

12:50.370 --> 12:51.801
I WAS THE ONE MAKING THE RULES,

12:51.802 --> 12:53.142
AND THAT MADE YOU
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

12:53.143 --> 12:55.404
OH, SO YOU HAVE ALL THIS
BUILT-UP RESENTMENT

12:55.405 --> 12:56.876
AND KICKING ME OUT
TODAY WAS PAYBACK?

12:56.877 --> 12:58.948
NO, IT'S LONGO FIT.

12:58.949 --> 13:01.410
I'M LONGO, ALL RIGHT?
WE GO BY MY RULES.

13:01.411 --> 13:03.452
IF IT WAS BURKE FIT, WE'D
BE FOLLOWING YOUR RULES.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.454
WE'D PROBABLY ALL BE DOING
BICEP CURLS WITH WINE GLASSES.

13:05.455 --> 13:07.987
SEE, NOW, I'D SIGN
UP FOR THAT CLASS.

13:07.988 --> 13:10.359
PARDON ME, IT IS
MY GREAT PLEASURE

13:10.360 --> 13:13.292
TO PRESENT TO YOU CHEF
MALCOLM SUNDERLAND.

13:13.293 --> 13:16.565
GOOD EVENING. WELCOME
TO THE CHEF'S TABLE.

13:16.566 --> 13:18.828
SO OUR FIRST COURSE...

13:18.829 --> 13:21.000
IS A PAN-SEARED COHO SALMON

13:21.001 --> 13:23.372
RUBBED LIGHTLY WITH LEMON PEPPER

13:23.373 --> 13:26.535
AND KISSED WITH A
SQUIRT OF LEMON JUICE.

13:26.536 --> 13:27.977
DELIGHTFUL.

13:27.978 --> 13:29.909
OOH, ALL THIS KISSING
AND SQUIRTING

13:29.910 --> 13:31.310
MAKES IT SOUNDS SO DIRTY.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.382
ENJOY.

13:33.844 --> 13:35.184
MM.

13:35.185 --> 13:36.415
OH, YEAH.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.587
I CAN DEFINITELY PUT OUR
FIGHT ON HOLD FOR THIS.

13:38.588 --> 13:40.349
OH MY GOD.

13:40.350 --> 13:41.851
UGH!

13:41.852 --> 13:43.292
THING'S RAW. IT'S AWFUL.

13:43.293 --> 13:45.394
NO, IT'S SEARED TO PERFECTION.

13:45.395 --> 13:47.096
NO, MEL, LOOK AT THIS.

13:47.097 --> 13:48.397
SEE THAT COLOR RIGHT THERE?

13:48.398 --> 13:50.299
THAT'S THE COLOR OF A
FAMILY INTESTINAL PARASITES

13:50.300 --> 13:51.400
THAT ARE PACKING THEIR BAGS

13:51.401 --> 13:53.362
AND GETTING READY TO MOVE
INTO MY DIGESTIVE TRACT.

13:53.363 --> 13:55.404
WELL, NOW I'M HUNGRY.

13:55.405 --> 13:57.306
NO, THERE'S... EXCUSE ME.

13:57.307 --> 13:59.438
CHEF MALCOLM, DUDE.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.010
I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHAT TO CALL HIM.

14:01.011 --> 14:02.411
YES, SIR, IS THERE A PROBLEM?

14:02.412 --> 14:05.144
YES, I THINK THERE'S BEEN A
MISTAKE HERE BECAUSE, UM...

14:05.145 --> 14:08.417
MY SALMON, IT'S STILL
SWIMMING UPSTREAM.

14:08.418 --> 14:09.879
IT'S UNCOOKED.

14:09.880 --> 14:11.520
OH, NO, THIS IS SEARED.

14:11.521 --> 14:13.622
AND THIS IS THE WAY
IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.

14:13.623 --> 14:15.284
YEAH, IF YOU'RE
STANDING IN THE RIVER

14:15.285 --> 14:16.485
AND YOU HAPPEN TO BE A BEAR.

14:16.486 --> 14:19.929
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY IT AND
YOU MIGHT REALLY LIKE IT.

14:19.930 --> 14:22.992
LOOK, I APPRECIATE IT, BUT I
SORT OF KNOW WHAT I LIKE.

14:22.993 --> 14:24.363
AND I THINK WHAT I WOULD LIKE

14:24.364 --> 14:26.595
HE'S... HE'S WALKING AWAY
WHILE I'M TALKING TO HIM.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.297
WHY IS HE WALKING AWAY
WHILE I'M TALKING TO HIM?

14:28.298 --> 14:30.439
JOE, LET IT GO. OKAY, THIS
IS WHAT WE PAID $400 FOR.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.941
TO EAT THE FOOD THE WAY

14:31.942 --> 14:33.542
THE MAN IN THE BIG WHITE
JACKET SAYS IT SHOULD BE MADE.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.574
MAYBE HE KNOWS SOMETHING.
IT IS HIS KITCHEN.

14:35.575 --> 14:37.346
YEAH, WELL, I'M THE
CUSTOMER, ALL RIGHT?

14:37.347 --> 14:39.248
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:39.249 --> 14:41.410
IF HE'S NOT GONNA
FIX IT, I WILL.

14:41.411 --> 14:42.451
WHAT? JOE, SIT DOWN.

14:42.452 --> 14:44.083
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.
THERE ARE RULES.

14:44.084 --> 14:46.656
TRUST ME. I GOT EVERYTHING
UNDER CONTROL HERE.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.360
SIR, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:51.361 --> 14:54.264
HATE TO TELL YOU THIS, PAL, BUT...
( chuckles ) YOUR JOB.

14:56.266 --> 14:58.297
SIR, PUT MY SPATULA DOWN.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.029
I WILL, JUST GIVE ME
LIKE TWO MINUTES.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.900
THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.172
LEAVE MY KITCHEN NOW.

15:03.173 --> 15:04.403
I HAVEN'T EVEN HAD DINNER YET!

15:04.404 --> 15:05.574
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
GET IN YOUR CAR

15:05.575 --> 15:06.675
AND DRIVE AROUND THE BLOCK,

15:06.676 --> 15:08.477
YOU MAY FIND SOME NUGGETS

15:08.478 --> 15:10.639
THAT SUIT YOU JUST FINE.
NOW LEAVE.

15:10.640 --> 15:13.113
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'D BE HAPPY TO.

15:15.015 --> 15:17.416
COME ON.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.648
SO I GUESS I'M
KICKED OUT TOO, HUH?

15:19.649 --> 15:21.320
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

15:21.321 --> 15:25.924
THAT'S COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT,
AND I AM NOT A BARBARIAN.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.028
MEL, ARE YOU GONNA STAY?

15:30.660 --> 15:32.332
IT'S FLAMING CHEESE.

15:33.633 --> 15:38.007
I DON'T THINK I CAN
TAKE FIRE TO GO.

15:38.008 --> 15:40.410
I'LL SEE YOU AT HOME THEN.

15:42.572 --> 15:44.443
THIS IS AN AGED TOMME

15:44.444 --> 15:47.116
RIGHT FROM THE
SOUTHWEST OF FRANCE.

15:47.117 --> 15:49.178
IT'S SOFT AND IT'S YIELDING.

15:49.179 --> 15:50.449
SAVE IT.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.720
I NEVER SAID THIS
ABOUT A MAN BEFORE,

15:51.721 --> 15:54.583
BUT HE'S MORE IMPORTANT TO
ME THAN FLAMING CHEESE.

15:54.584 --> 15:56.725
WOW, YOU'RE A VERY
FORGIVING WOMEN.

15:56.726 --> 15:59.328
UGH, TRUST ME. I'M NOT
FORGIVING ANYBODY.

15:59.329 --> 16:00.489
THAT SALMON AIN'T THE ONLY ONE

16:00.490 --> 16:02.362
GETTING ITS ASS SEARED TONIGHT.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.740
WHAT IF CASSANDRA REFUSES

16:11.741 --> 16:13.242
TO GO ON A FAMILY VACATION

16:13.243 --> 16:15.044
BECAUSE SHE HAS A
VISION THAT TELLS HER

16:15.045 --> 16:16.576
THE HOTEL BEDSPREAD
WILL BE TOTALLY GROSS.

16:18.748 --> 16:21.280
- LENNOX, ARE YOU LISTENING?
- WE NEED TO TALK.

16:21.281 --> 16:23.012
YEAH, I KNOW, IT
WASN'T MY BEST IDEA.

16:23.013 --> 16:24.383
I MEAN, ABOUT US.

16:24.384 --> 16:27.316
WHEN YOU GO AWAY TO COLLEGE,
I DON'T WANT US TO BREAK UP.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.988
- UH, ME NEITHER.
- YEAH, BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT US

16:29.989 --> 16:31.690
TO HAVE ONE OF THOSE
LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS

16:31.691 --> 16:33.062
WHERE EVERYONE GETS HURT.

16:33.063 --> 16:34.993
- WHO WOULD WANT THAT?
- OKAY OKAY.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.266
SO HERE'S WHAT I THINK. WE
NEED TO SET SOME RULES.

16:37.267 --> 16:39.128
LIKE WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,
WE'LL BE TOGETHER.

16:39.129 --> 16:40.229
AND THEN WHEN WE'RE
NOT TOGETHER,

16:40.230 --> 16:42.301
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

16:42.302 --> 16:43.732
HUH?

16:43.733 --> 16:45.574
LIKE WHEN WE'RE IN
THE SAME PLACE,

16:45.575 --> 16:48.437
THE SAME CITY, THE SAME... ZONE,

16:48.438 --> 16:49.578
WE'LL BE EXCLUSIVE.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.340
BUT THEN WHEN WE'RE
IN DIFFERENT ZONES,

16:51.341 --> 16:53.582
WE WON'T BE EXCLUSIVE.

16:53.583 --> 16:57.086
SO YOU WANT TO BE NON-EXCLUSIVE,
LIKE, WITH OTHER GUYS.

16:57.087 --> 16:58.287
WELL, ONLY WHEN WE'RE
NOT IN THE SAME ZONE.

16:58.288 --> 17:00.549
OH, GREAT. UM...

17:00.550 --> 17:04.593
SO WHERE EXACTLY DOES THIS
NON-EXCLUSIVE ZONE BEGIN AND END?

17:04.594 --> 17:06.255
ARE YOU MY GIRLFRIEND
WHEN I GET ON THE PLANE?

17:06.256 --> 17:08.697
OR ONLY WHEN I CROSS
INTO OHIO AIRSPACE?

17:08.698 --> 17:12.030
IS THERE AN APP SO I
CAN TRACK THE ZONE?

17:12.031 --> 17:13.262
YOU'RE NOT TAKING
THIS SERIOUSLY.

17:13.263 --> 17:14.503
YOU'RE NOT TAKING US SERIOUSLY.

17:14.504 --> 17:16.165
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAVE US.

17:16.166 --> 17:18.167
WE DON'T HAVE TO BREAK UP
LIKE EVERY OTHER COUPLE

17:18.168 --> 17:20.069
WHO TRIES A LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP.

17:20.070 --> 17:21.710
THANKS FOR PROTECTING
OUR RELATIONSHIP

17:21.711 --> 17:23.242
BY PRETENDING IT DOESN'T EXIST.

17:23.243 --> 17:25.374
NO, I'M JUST TRYING TO
ESTABLISH SOME RULES

17:25.375 --> 17:27.246
SO WE CAN KEEP THIS
THING FROM ENDING

17:27.247 --> 17:30.679
IN ANGER AND TEARS.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.822
( in tears ) WELL, BRAVO, YOU'VE
DONE A BANG-UP JOB OF THAT.

17:33.823 --> 17:37.386
I'M SORRY, BUT WHAT'S THE
ALTERNATIVE, ZANDER?

17:37.387 --> 17:39.288
THAT WE STAY TOGETHER IN
A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP

17:39.289 --> 17:40.459
IN ALL TIME ZONES.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.331
WELL, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE
IN THE REAL WORLD.

17:42.332 --> 17:44.062
- I GUESS WE JUST BREAK UP THEN.
- FINE!

17:44.063 --> 17:46.295
GOOD! WE'RE BROKEN UP!
DONE! WORLDWIDE!

17:46.296 --> 17:48.337
NO MATTER WHAT CITY WE'RE IN,
WE'RE NOT A COUPLE AT ALL.

17:48.338 --> 17:50.068
WELL, WE CAN START BY NOT
BEING A COUPLE RIGHT NOW.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.500
AND WE'RE NOT DOING THAT WHOLE
"LET'S STAY FRIENDS" THING EITHER.

17:51.501 --> 17:53.142
I'M FINE WITH THAT. CLEAN BREAK,

17:53.143 --> 17:54.173
JUST SEVER ALL TIES.

17:54.174 --> 17:55.175
( computer beeps )

17:59.409 --> 18:01.550
"DEAR, MISS SCANLON AND MR.
CARLSON,

18:01.551 --> 18:03.382
YOU GUYS ROCK.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.185
WE WANT TO BUY YOUR WEB
SERIES, 'CASSANDRA.'

18:06.186 --> 18:08.787
WE THINK IT'S PERFECT
FOR LAUGHORCHOKE.COM.

18:08.788 --> 18:11.390
CONTRACTS TO FOLLOW."

18:11.391 --> 18:13.292
- OH MY GOD!
- WE'RE A HIT!

18:13.293 --> 18:14.524
( both laughing )

18:16.296 --> 18:17.426
( clears throat )

18:17.427 --> 18:19.598
THIS IS TOTALLY
AWESOME NEWS, RIGHT?

18:19.599 --> 18:21.830
YEAH, WE CAN STILL
WORK TOGETHER.

18:21.831 --> 18:24.233
YOU KNOW, WE CAN NOT BE
DATING AND NOT BE FRIENDS

18:24.234 --> 18:26.435
AND HAVE IT NOT BE AWKWARD.

18:26.436 --> 18:28.677
OH, YEAH, SO NOT AWKWARD.

18:28.678 --> 18:30.209
YOU'RE HOLDING MY HAND.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.212
OH, RIGHT, NONE OF THAT.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.645
MEL, LOOK, I REALLY APPRECIATE

18:36.646 --> 18:39.218
YOU LEAVING THE
RESTAURANT WITH ME, OKAY?

18:39.219 --> 18:42.521
OH, COME ON, NOW. SAY
SOMETHING, WILL YOU?

18:42.522 --> 18:43.622
YOU KNOW I HATE THE
SILENT TREATMENT.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.824
IT'S LIKE WORSE THAN YELLING.

18:46.696 --> 18:48.797
MEL, COME ON!

18:48.798 --> 18:50.599
SAY SOMETHING. I
SAID I WAS SORRY

18:50.600 --> 18:52.261
LIKE 1,000 TIMES.

18:52.262 --> 18:53.802
YEAH, BUT YOU DIDN'T MEAN IT.

18:53.803 --> 18:56.265
I GOT TO MEAN IT?

18:56.266 --> 18:58.136
YEAH, OF COURSE.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.439
WHAT'D I DO WRONG? I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT I DID WRONG.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.741
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE, OKAY?
LOOK...

19:02.742 --> 19:04.373
YOU THREW A TANTRUM IN
ANOTHER MAN'S KITCHEN

19:04.374 --> 19:06.845
WHO ONLY HAPPENS TO BE THE
FINEST CHEF IN ALL OF TOLEDO.

19:06.846 --> 19:09.518
I MEAN, IT IS HIS PLACE, AFTER ALL.
HE CALLS THE SHOTS.

19:09.519 --> 19:10.919
HOW'D YOU LIKE IT IF I CAME
INTO YOUR EXERCISE CLASS

19:10.920 --> 19:13.183
AND TOLD YOU HOW... MAYBE
THAT'S A BAD EXAMPLE.

19:14.224 --> 19:16.385
OH, WAIT A MINUTE! WAIT
A MINUTE, HOLD ON.

19:16.386 --> 19:18.287
HOLD ON. MEL, I THINK YOU'RE
ON TO SOMETHING HERE.

19:18.288 --> 19:21.360
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE
PRESENCE OF, SAY, A MASTER,

19:21.361 --> 19:23.532
MAYBE IT'S NOT A BAD IDEA
TO LISTEN TO THAT GUY.

19:23.533 --> 19:27.236
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S EVEN WRONG
AND SOMEWHAT DISRESPECTFUL

19:27.237 --> 19:30.239
TO TRY TO TAKE OVER AND
DEMAND TO HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.301
MAYBE... THAT'S ACTUALLY
A VERY BAD EXAMPLE.

19:32.302 --> 19:34.543
NO, ACTUALLY, JOE,

19:34.544 --> 19:36.305
I THINK IT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE.

19:36.306 --> 19:37.806
YEAH, YOURS WAS TOO.

19:37.807 --> 19:41.510
YOU KNOW, I THINK CHEF
SUNDERLAND AND SERGEANT LONGO

19:41.511 --> 19:44.413
DESERVE MORE RESPECT THAN
EITHER OF US SHOWED THEM TODAY.

19:44.414 --> 19:46.285
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:46.286 --> 19:49.258
YOU KNOW, MEL, I THINK
IT'S KIND OF COOL

19:49.259 --> 19:50.519
THAT YOU PUT ME IN
THE SAME LEAGUE

19:50.520 --> 19:52.291
AS CHEF SUNDERLAND.

19:52.292 --> 19:54.393
AND I'M TELLING YOU,
I REALLY BELIEVE

19:54.394 --> 19:56.295
THAT WITH SOME GOOD MARKETING,

19:56.296 --> 19:57.966
LONGO FIT COULD TURN
INTO SOMETHING BIG.

19:57.967 --> 20:00.969
WELL, THEN I AM BEHIND YOU 100%.

20:00.970 --> 20:02.631
TO LONGO FIT.

20:02.632 --> 20:04.473
MAY THERE BE THOUSANDS
OF OUT-OF-SHAPE PEOPLE

20:04.474 --> 20:05.874
IN THE CITY OF TOLEDO

20:05.875 --> 20:09.678
WHO LOVE BEING TORTURED BY A
SWEET, SEXY DRILL SERGEANT.

20:09.679 --> 20:10.779
JUST NOT YOU.

20:10.780 --> 20:11.910
YEAH.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.282
IF YOU GOT RID OF THE SQUATS,

20:13.283 --> 20:15.414
AND MAYBE ADDED SOME
NAPS AND SOME WINE,

20:15.415 --> 20:16.415
I'M IN.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.986
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

20:17.987 --> 20:19.419
- REALLY?
- NO.

20:25.755 --> 20:27.926
POUR IN SLOWLY

20:27.927 --> 20:29.598
ONE HALF-CUP BRANDY.

20:29.599 --> 20:31.900
- OH, I LIKE IT ALREADY.
- NO NO NO NO.

20:31.901 --> 20:33.762
POUR IT IN THE PAN.

20:33.763 --> 20:36.765
OKAY, YOU'RE REALLY GONNA
HAVE TO BE MORE SPECIFIC.

20:36.766 --> 20:38.867
ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN'T
ASK JOE HOW TO DO THIS?

20:38.868 --> 20:41.310
HEY, WE ARE TWO
INTELLIGENT WOMEN.

20:41.311 --> 20:42.571
IT'S FLAMING CHEESE.

20:42.572 --> 20:44.813
WORSE-CASE SCENARIO,
WE HAVE MELTED CHEESE.

20:44.814 --> 20:47.846
NO, WORSE-CASE SCENARIO,
WE BURN OFF OUR EYEBROWS.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.579
AND I USE THESE A LOT.

20:50.580 --> 20:52.481
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL HAPPENS.

20:52.482 --> 20:55.984
ALL RIGHT, "TILT PAN
AND LIGHT THE BRANDY."

20:55.985 --> 20:57.786
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

20:57.787 --> 20:59.559
YOU'RE SUCH A GIRL.

21:03.693 --> 21:05.735
OOH!

21:08.267 --> 21:10.769
OH, LOOK, IT'S COOKED PERFECTLY.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.000
BOY, I DON'T KNOW.

21:12.001 --> 21:15.744
IT LOOKS A LITTLE UNDERDONE.

21:15.745 --> 21:17.576
YEAH, MAYBE WE CAN
FIRE IT UP AGAIN.

21:17.577 --> 21:18.908
BUT THIS TIME, I
GET TO LIGHT IT.

21:26.416 --> 21:27.817
FIRE IN THE HOLE!
