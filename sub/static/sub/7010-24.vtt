11:11.504 --> 11:14.005
YEAH, THANKS FOR
CRACKING THAT CODE.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.466
HEY, MAN.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:16.634 --> 11:18.218
THEY'RE GOING UP
TO HAVE SEX.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.804
GET THE WAX
OUT OF YOUR EARS.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.641
MAN, YOU CAN'T
BRING MY SISTER

11:24.809 --> 11:26.017
DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.103
THIS IS OUR FORTRESS
OF SOLITUDE.

11:28.270 --> 11:31.564
WELL, I'M SORRY, BUT SHE'S MY
GIRLFRIEND, AND I LOVE HER.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.275
NO, YOU DON'T.

11:34.443 --> 11:36.903
WELL, I LIKE HER.

11:37.071 --> 11:40.323
NO, YOU DON'T.

11:40.491 --> 11:42.826
I THINK SHE IS OKAY,

11:43.577 --> 11:47.247
AND THE LINE BETWEEN LOVE
AND OKAY IS PRETTY FINE.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.207
BUT THE LINE BETWEEN DOING
IT AND NOT DOING IT,

11:49.375 --> 11:53.086
THAT'S NOT FINE
AT ALL.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.922
JUST LIKE THE LINE
BETWEEN MORON AND IDIOT?

11:56.090 --> 11:59.008
EXACTLY. YOU KNOW,
IT TOOK ME MONTHS

11:59.176 --> 12:00.593
TO GET JACKIE
IN THE SACK.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.554
WELL, LAURIE, SHE
ALREADY LETS ME DO IT,

12:02.722 --> 12:03.888
AND PLUS,
I'M OVER HERE

12:04.056 --> 12:05.306
ALL THE TIME,
ANYWAY,

12:05.474 --> 12:10.729
SO THERE'S LIKE,
THE CONVENIENCE FACTOR.

12:12.189 --> 12:16.401
KELSO, MY BOOKCASE ISN'T
GOING TO MOVE ITSELF.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.948
OR MAYBE IT WILL.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.786
DAMN, I GOTTA GO.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.959
DUMBEST BABIES EVER.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.968
JACKIE? IT'S GREAT
TO SEE YOU SO HAPPY.

12:42.136 --> 12:46.306
AND STRONG.
AND OVER KELSO.

12:46.474 --> 12:49.768
YOU'RE LIKE A ROCK. YOU'RE
LIKE A TINY LITTLE ROCK.

12:50.644 --> 12:53.438
DONNA, ARE YOU TRYING
TO TELL ME BAD NEWS,

12:53.939 --> 12:56.941
OR ARE YOU MAKING FUN
OF MY BUTT?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.069
NO, YOUR BUTT'S FINE.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.321
FINE?

13:01.489 --> 13:06.159
GLORIOUS.
WHATEVER. LOOK.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.119
KELSO'S DATING LAURIE.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.829
[GASPS]

13:09.997 --> 13:12.457
I DON'T CARE.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.501
OH, COME ON.
HOW CAN YOU

13:14.668 --> 13:15.960
STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HIM?

13:16.128 --> 13:17.837
DONNA, I DON'T HAVE
FEELINGS FOR HIM.

13:18.005 --> 13:21.591
I JUST HATE THAT BITCH
FOR MAKING HIM HAPPY.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.176
OH, BELIEVE ME.
SHE WILL MAKE HIM

13:23.344 --> 13:25.637
MORE MISERABLE
THAN YOU EVER DID.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.973
OH, DONNA. THANK YOU.

13:30.100 --> 13:33.228
I'M GONNA PRAY TO GOD
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.404
LAURIE, I HAVE
TO TALK TO YOU.

13:45.115 --> 13:48.493
KELSO, WE GOTTA
CONFAB, MAN.

13:49.119 --> 13:52.288
OKAY.

13:52.456 --> 13:53.665
TOO MANY TIMES
I HAVE SAT IDLY BY

13:53.833 --> 13:54.958
AND WATCHED YOU
MAKE BAD CHOICES.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.669
I'VE SEEN YOU SCREW UP
AN AWFUL LOT.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.173
AND SURE,
I'VE ENJOYED IT.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.217
Both: BUT NOW,
YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.803
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

14:06.971 --> 14:09.055
DUH. I'M NOT
AN IDIOT.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.350
UH-UH.

14:13.727 --> 14:17.689
MICHAEL HAS SOME
NICE QUALITIES, BUT...

14:17.857 --> 14:19.941
LAURIE'S GOT
GREAT LEGS...

14:20.109 --> 14:23.403
AND A FINE RACK,
BUT...

14:23.571 --> 14:25.154
HE'S JUST A BOY.

14:25.322 --> 14:28.700
SHE'S A MAJOR
SKANKOID.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.993
AND YOU DON'T KNOW

14:30.160 --> 14:31.870
WHERE A BOY LIKE THAT
WILL END UP.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.162
AND YOU DON'T KNOW

14:33.330 --> 14:35.874
WHERE A GIRL LIKE THAT
HAS BEEN.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.917
NOW, I KNOW. I KNOW
YOU WANT A BOYFRIEND

14:38.085 --> 14:42.547
WHO'S WEAK
AND EASILY MANIPULATED.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.090
NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE WEAK

14:44.258 --> 14:46.718
AND EASILY
MANIPULATED.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.886
BUT YOU HAVE
GOT TO LEARN

14:48.053 --> 14:49.721
TO THINK
ABOUT THE FUTURE.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.684
BUT YOU'VE GOT
TO LEARN TO THINK.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.311
AND...

14:56.478 --> 14:58.646
Both: AND MAKE
SMART CHOICES.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.064
'CAUSE
WHAT'S CONVENIENT

15:00.232 --> 15:01.733
ISN'T ALWAYS
WHAT'S BEST.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.568
IF IT WERE,
I'D JUST

15:03.736 --> 15:07.614
THROW ON A MUUMUU
AND EAT OUT OF A CAN.

15:08.782 --> 15:10.450
IF IT WERE,
THIS FROZEN PIZZA

15:10.618 --> 15:13.995
WOULDN'T TASTE
LIKE MONKEY BUTT.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.123
OKAY. ARE YOU DONE

15:17.291 --> 15:19.667
WITH THIS
LITTLE LECTURE?

15:19.835 --> 15:22.879
OKAY. YOU DONE
WITH THAT PIZZA?

15:24.465 --> 15:26.257
Both: YES.

15:26.425 --> 15:29.302
AND I THINK
I'VE MADE MY POINT.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.598
[THINKING] OH, GOD.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.475
I'VE GOT TO GET
MY OWN PLACE.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.851
[THINKING]
THIS DOESN'T TASTE

15:37.019 --> 15:39.687
LIKE MONKEY BUTT.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.398
OH, JEEZ, RED.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE

15:42.566 --> 15:44.400
FOR OUR
LITTLE MEETING.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.361
MY, UH, DOG GOT...

15:46.528 --> 15:49.155
UH, CAR GOT HIT
BY A, UH...

15:49.323 --> 15:53.368
CAR. ACCIDENT.
THAT'S THE WORD.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.287
ERIC? TAKE YOUR BREAK
ANYWHERE BUT HERE.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.044
EARL...

16:03.212 --> 16:04.963
YOU'RE FIRED.

16:05.130 --> 16:09.258
WHAT? WHAT DID I DO?

16:09.426 --> 16:11.594
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

16:11.762 --> 16:13.972
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT YOU DID.

16:14.139 --> 16:19.018
[ANGRY GIBBERISH]

16:38.580 --> 16:41.332
AND ANOTHER THING.

16:42.376 --> 16:45.503
[ANGRY GIBBERISH]

16:48.716 --> 16:51.050
HI. HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

16:51.218 --> 16:53.302
I HAD TO LET EARL GO.

16:53.470 --> 16:55.179
LET EARL GO?

16:55.347 --> 16:58.474
YOU YELLED AT HIM
UNTIL HE CRIED.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.978
HEY. WHAT KIND
OF A MAN CRIES

17:02.146 --> 17:04.772
AFTER ONLY 15 MINUTES
OF YELLING?

17:06.025 --> 17:07.358
WELL, I'M SORRY.
I DON'T LIKE

17:07.526 --> 17:08.943
THE WAY
YOU HANDLED EARL.

17:09.111 --> 17:11.446
DAD, HE WAS
YOUR FRIEND.

17:11.613 --> 17:13.656
ERIC, HUSH, HUSH,
HUSH, HUSH.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.453
ERIC, WORK IS WORK.

17:18.620 --> 17:21.039
YOU DON'T SHOW UP LATE,
YOU DON'T MAKE EXCUSES,

17:21.206 --> 17:23.291
AND YOU DON'T NOT WORK.

17:23.459 --> 17:26.502
IF IT WASN'T WORK,
THEY WOULDN'T CALL IT WORK.

17:26.670 --> 17:31.591
THEY'D CALL IT SUPER-WONDERFUL,
CRAZY-FUN TIME.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.302
OR SKIPPITY-DOO.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.804
OH, JEEZ. WHY THE HELL
AM I EVEN TALKING TO YOU?

17:39.308 --> 17:40.933
OH, ERIC.

17:41.101 --> 17:44.103
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO
AND UPSET YOUR FATHER?

17:44.688 --> 17:46.022
I CAN'T HAVE
MY OWN OPINION

17:46.190 --> 17:47.648
WITHOUT HIM
TEARING MY HEAD OFF?

17:47.816 --> 17:49.609
NO.

17:49.777 --> 17:52.862
AND I THINK AT YOUR AGE, YOU
SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW.

17:53.489 --> 17:56.074
WELL, NO, MOM, NO.
UH-UH.

17:56.241 --> 17:58.159
MAN, WE HAD SUCH A GOOD
THING GOING AT WORK,

17:58.327 --> 17:59.827
AND HE JUST
WRECKED THAT.

17:59.995 --> 18:01.621
AND BY THE WAY,
WITHOUT EARL,

18:01.789 --> 18:06.250
I'M BACK
TO DUMB-ASS.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.046
HE'S JUST...
HE'S JUST MEAN.

18:10.214 --> 18:12.965
OH, YOU SHUT
YOUR PORKY MOUTH, MISTER.

18:13.425 --> 18:14.592
WELL THEN,
IT JUST STINKS

18:14.760 --> 18:16.135
BECAUSE,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:16.303 --> 18:17.261
THIS IS
THE FIRST TIME

18:17.429 --> 18:21.057
WE WERE EVER LIKE, YOU
KNOW, COOL WITH EACH OTHER.

18:21.809 --> 18:23.017
MAN, WHY DOES
HE HAVE TO BE

18:23.185 --> 18:24.435
SUCH A HARD-ASS
ALL THE TIME?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.062
OH, COME ON, ERIC.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.189
THAT'S HOW
HE EXPRESSES HIMSELF.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.484
THAT'S HOW HE'S ALWAYS
EXPRESSED HIMSELF.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.488
YOUR FATHER YELLS AT YOU
BECAUSE HE CARES.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.491
YEAH, RIGHT. WELL, IF THAT'S
TRUE, THEN...

18:38.659 --> 18:40.034
THEN...

18:40.202 --> 18:41.327
STAND UP STRAIGHT.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.870
YOU'RE
A DUMB-ASS.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.081
YOU CALL THIS
A REPORT CARD?

18:45.249 --> 18:49.335
HANDS ABOVE
THE COVERS.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.213
HUH.

18:52.381 --> 18:55.216
I GUESS HE REALLY,
REALLY CARES.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.009
AND...

18:57.177 --> 19:00.429
IF NOT, YOU'RE...
YOU'RE MOVING OUT SOON.

19:09.273 --> 19:13.776
SO. YOU KNOW
WHO I HATE?

19:13.944 --> 19:16.612
LAURIE.

19:16.780 --> 19:18.406
OH, JACKIE. I KNOW
YOU'RE UPSET

19:18.574 --> 19:20.950
AND... AND IN PAIN,

19:21.118 --> 19:22.368
BUT YOU'RE
NOT GOING TO TALK

19:22.536 --> 19:25.371
DURING HOLLYWOOD
SQUARES, ARE YOU?

19:25.539 --> 19:27.290
NO, I MEAN,
I REALLY DO HATE HER.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.417
NO OFFENSE, ERIC,
BUT YOUR SISTER...

19:29.585 --> 19:31.752
SHE'S A SLUT.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.337
OH, MY GOD.

19:33.505 --> 19:35.548
JACKIE, NOT SINCE
THE SMOKY VS. BANDIT DEBATE

19:35.716 --> 19:38.718
HAVE YOU AND I SO BEEN
ON THE SAME PAGE.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.344
YEAH, I THINK
WE'RE ALL ON BOARD.

19:40.512 --> 19:41.721
GOD,
THIS IS SO GREAT.

19:41.889 --> 19:46.976
YOU GUYS ALL HATE
LAURIE AND LOVE ME.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.482
YEAH, WE ALL HATE LAURIE.

19:54.401 --> 19:58.029
SHH. OH, GREAT.

19:58.197 --> 20:01.616

20:03.911 --> 20:06.454
HEY, GUYS.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.040
OH, HI, MICHAEL.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.210
KELSO, AS YOUR
NEW GIRLFRIEND,

20:12.377 --> 20:13.502
I'M REALLY

20:13.670 --> 20:15.046
WITH YOUR
OLD GIRLFRIEND

20:15.214 --> 20:17.381
HANGING OUT
DOWN HERE.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.759
OKAY.

20:19.927 --> 20:21.802
UH, HEY, JACKIE,
DO YOU MIND?

20:21.970 --> 20:24.931
NO. NO, I DON'T MIND
IF YOU LEAVE.

20:27.351 --> 20:30.478
SHE'S NOT LEAVING.

20:31.271 --> 20:33.814
WELL, I'M NOT,
EITHER.

20:33.982 --> 20:36.442
SHE'S NOT, EITHER.

20:36.610 --> 20:43.699
FINE.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.409
HEY!
THIS IS MY HOUSE.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.870
SO WHAT?
ERIC WANTS ME HERE.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.622
DON'T YOU, ERIC?

20:49.790 --> 20:53.417
WHY, YES, I DO.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.879
YOU BETTER
WATCH YOUR BACK.

20:57.047 --> 20:58.756
REALLY? 'CAUSE YOU...

20:58.924 --> 21:01.926
SHOULD STOP SPENDING
SO MUCH TIME ON YOURS.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.180
OHH. BURN!

21:06.348 --> 21:08.891
[LAUGHS]

21:10.269 --> 21:12.436
HEY, I'M SORRY.
I JUST GOT SWEPT AWAY

21:12.604 --> 21:15.064
BY THE SUPERGOOD BURN.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.565
SHUT UP!

21:16.733 --> 21:18.818
AAH... AAH... AAH.

21:20.988 --> 21:22.321
JACKIE?

21:22.489 --> 21:23.990
THAT WAS

21:24.157 --> 21:25.616
THANK YOU, FEZ.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.911
NOW, PLEASE.
SIT NEXT TO FEZ.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.250
MOVE IT.

21:39.589 --> 21:41.424
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU DOING

21:41.591 --> 21:42.967
IN THE SHOWER
SO LONG?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.468
YOU KNOW
IT WASTES WATER,

21:44.636 --> 21:45.886
AND IT MIGHT
MAKE ME LATE.

21:46.054 --> 21:47.555
IN FACT,
I AM DEFINITELY

21:47.723 --> 21:50.433
NOT GONNA BE THE FIRST
PERSON THERE.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.227
YOU KNOW HOW
THAT MAKES ME LOOK?

21:53.395 --> 21:57.315
DAMN IT. YOU'VE GOT TO GROW UP
AND LEARN SOME RESPONSIBILITY.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.442
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY
CARSEY-WERNER PRODUCTIONS
AND FOX BROADCASTING COMPANY

21:59.609 --> 22:02.737
I LOVE YOU, TOO, DAD.
