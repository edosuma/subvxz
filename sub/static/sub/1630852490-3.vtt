01:18.680 --> 01:20.120
with earnest desire alone.

01:20.120 --> 01:22.250
You must bear every single pain.

01:22.250 --> 01:23.770
Or give up quickly.

Elle...

01:39.789 --> 01:41.880
What the heck are you talking about?

01:41.910 --> 01:43.110
You answer.

01:47.990 --> 01:49.300
She's wrong, right?

01:54.470 --> 01:56.620
Why are you so mean?

01:59.539 --> 02:00.360
Jenna...

02:00.800 --> 02:01.800
Jenna...

02:04.200 --> 02:05.420
She's wrong, right?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.890
She's always so bitter.

02:08.660 --> 02:10.180
She's wrong, right?

02:16.710 --> 02:18.440
You!

02:18.440 --> 02:21.340
How could you? How could you!

02:23.500 --> 02:24.500
Seriously!

02:25.570 --> 02:26.700
Why didn't you tell us?

02:26.720 --> 02:29.320
Were you worried we'd sabotage you staying?

02:29.320 --> 02:31.590
She already turned his offer down.

02:35.650 --> 02:36.990
You knew?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.670
I told her not to tell.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.350
Until our gig was over.

02:42.760 --> 02:43.760
Gig?

02:45.050 --> 02:46.730
What does a gig matter?

02:47.410 --> 02:49.150
What does a marketplace gig

02:49.150 --> 02:51.350
- matter...
- It matters to me!

02:51.980 --> 02:52.770
Whatever it is,

02:52.770 --> 02:55.329
it gives me reason to live tomorrow!

02:57.150 --> 02:58.510
Whatever it is...

03:03.120 --> 03:05.050
You'll die if you can't do that?

03:05.050 --> 03:07.320
You'll die because of it?

03:08.110 --> 03:09.820
Don't be ridiculous!

04:41.180 --> 04:43.180
Stop taking her side!

04:43.400 --> 04:45.080
She deceived you, too.

04:45.370 --> 04:48.790
She knew the gig was no use, but she kept silent!

04:50.280 --> 04:52.170
So she could survive by herself.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.390
You know Jenna isn't like that.

04:54.390 --> 04:55.390
Du-ho!

04:57.230 --> 04:59.220
Let's say you're doing this for us.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.170
But you know what?

05:01.860 --> 05:03.790
I don't feel grateful at all.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.780
Our chance will come?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.510
How do you know that?

05:14.330 --> 05:14.890
From my perspective...

05:14.890 --> 05:17.020
That's why I'm not grateful.

05:18.340 --> 05:19.840
What is your perspective?

05:20.620 --> 05:22.000
You're a hillbilly.

05:22.670 --> 05:23.680
Whenever you said

05:23.680 --> 05:27.060
that we're the best and we're good,

05:29.340 --> 05:30.460
I was ashamed.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.770
Because I realized what my level was.

05:33.770 --> 05:35.580
It drove me crazy!

05:37.850 --> 05:39.880
Then... I'm sorry.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.150
I don't want to hear you say that!

05:42.850 --> 05:44.300
Who do you think you are?

05:45.240 --> 05:46.520
We're strangers.

05:48.070 --> 05:50.220
Why are we a priority over your life?

05:50.220 --> 05:51.380
Why do you act

05:51.380 --> 05:53.220
like our real brother or our parent?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.400
Your amateurish empathy

06:00.750 --> 06:02.440
was so pathetic.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.280
Elle.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.550
It's been a long time.

06:52.350 --> 06:53.560
You've been well?

06:53.560 --> 06:54.450
Yes.

06:56.200 --> 06:57.240
You have a gig?

06:57.240 --> 06:57.980
Yes.

06:58.230 --> 06:59.590
A red-carpet gig.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.790
I heard you're breaking up another team.

07:05.440 --> 07:07.100
People call you a leopard

07:07.100 --> 07:08.510
that can't change its spots.

07:08.570 --> 07:09.960
I don't, though.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.230
I thought you were lasting long there.

07:13.930 --> 07:16.010
You ditched us after a year.

07:18.410 --> 07:20.090
I'm not picking a fight.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.430
We succeeded after you left us.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.910
I think your bad energy

07:26.970 --> 07:28.780
was blocking our luck.

07:29.230 --> 07:30.630
That's my guess.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.560
Anyway, do your best.

07:56.180 --> 07:58.250
What do you think you're doing?

07:58.680 --> 08:00.110
You're disbanding us?

08:01.750 --> 08:03.330
You're here to complain about that?

08:03.460 --> 08:05.130
We're going by the contract.

08:05.130 --> 08:06.130
Be quiet.

08:07.810 --> 08:10.630
You must be mad, but it wasn't an easy decision.

08:10.930 --> 08:13.420
I'll still help you go independent...

08:13.420 --> 08:15.680
I heard you said you'll sign me on

08:16.860 --> 08:18.620
if Jenna won't stay.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.370
Sign me on, Sir.

08:28.020 --> 08:30.020
I know you like Jenna

08:30.760 --> 08:32.210
more than me.

08:34.610 --> 08:36.940
But look at me now.

08:37.380 --> 08:39.299
I can do really well.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.120
I can make you a lot of money.

08:44.430 --> 08:45.690
Please...

08:49.930 --> 08:51.860
Give me one more chance.

08:54.970 --> 08:56.080
One more...

08:56.490 --> 08:58.950
Give me one more chance, Sir.

09:02.660 --> 09:03.340
Leave.

09:03.340 --> 09:04.870
- Sir...
- You take turns going mad?

09:04.870 --> 09:07.500
Go. Now. Get out. Come on! Huh?

09:07.500 --> 09:09.750
The dream that touched me

09:11.980 --> 09:16.500
I remember that thrill

09:26.780 --> 09:29.180
Signing on me or Jenna

09:29.710 --> 09:31.910
means you're planning a solo act.

09:32.220 --> 09:34.330
If it's a solo act, then I'm perfect for it.

09:34.470 --> 09:35.960
You know that, right?

09:35.960 --> 09:37.500
What's wrong with you? Just leave...

09:37.500 --> 09:38.950
Hear me out!

09:41.370 --> 09:43.230
Hear me out just this once.

09:46.670 --> 09:49.610
You haven't heard me sing in a long time.

10:09.690 --> 10:11.680
Yesterday and today

10:11.680 --> 10:15.650
The days are too short

10:17.260 --> 10:19.240
Will tomorrow be different?

10:19.240 --> 10:23.410
Will the day I long for come?

10:25.430 --> 10:28.830
Shadows are drawn

10:28.830 --> 10:32.570
So I can't see the sky

10:33.440 --> 10:38.330
Will the day come when I blossom?

10:39.350 --> 10:41.480
The dream that was my everything

10:41.660 --> 10:45.320
I remember that thrill

10:45.470 --> 10:47.440
Don't let it hide you

10:47.680 --> 10:51.450
I leave my confined self behind

10:51.450 --> 10:53.620
Dark night blues

10:53.680 --> 10:57.320
Riding out the storm, I bloom

10:57.820 --> 11:02.990
When my time comes again

11:15.400 --> 11:17.500
When the darkness falls

11:17.810 --> 11:21.300
Even if I'm all alone at night

11:21.350 --> 11:23.290
It'll be okay

11:23.580 --> 11:27.000
Even if I spend many nights crying

11:27.000 --> 11:29.710
It'll be dazzling

11:29.940 --> 11:31.790
Shine on my days

11:31.790 --> 11:33.750
Radiantly

11:33.770 --> 11:38.590
When the season I've been waiting for comes

11:39.230 --> 11:41.360
The dream that was my everything

11:41.580 --> 11:45.360
I remember that thrill

11:45.410 --> 11:47.480
Don't let it hide you

11:47.640 --> 11:51.480
The moonlight will know how I feel

11:51.480 --> 11:53.650
Dark night blues

11:53.650 --> 11:57.380
Riding out the storm, I bloom

11:57.780 --> 12:02.760
When my time comes again

12:03.370 --> 12:05.440
The dream that is my everything

12:05.690 --> 12:09.410
Even when the wind blows sometimes

12:09.410 --> 12:11.440
Just let it hold you

12:11.600 --> 12:15.410
I'll dye it with my light

12:15.410 --> 12:17.620
Shine, my bloom

12:17.690 --> 12:21.370
I'll see you soon

12:21.740 --> 12:26.770
Someday my time will come

12:27.310 --> 12:30.200
I trust myself

12:30.380 --> 12:33.290
Even if it's still shabby

12:33.390 --> 12:36.020
I can see it

12:36.020 --> 12:39.300
Even if it's not easy

12:39.300 --> 12:44.310
I'll greet it dazzlingly

12:44.310 --> 12:46.650
Radiantly

12:50.830 --> 12:56.540
When the season I've been waiting for comes

13:10.780 --> 13:12.460
It's the same camera.

13:13.810 --> 13:16.090
But in front of that one, I get so stiff.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.190
When I was young,

13:19.190 --> 13:21.190
I was dragged to my mom's set.

13:23.030 --> 13:24.710
Chae-ryeong loved it.

13:25.470 --> 13:26.750
But I was bored.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.210
They filmed the same scene over and over again.

13:34.370 --> 13:37.460
We practice over and over again.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.420
It's different.

13:46.880 --> 13:48.760
But that's over, too.

13:51.870 --> 13:53.230
It's really over.

14:03.920 --> 14:05.050
About Jenna...

14:05.710 --> 14:07.510
If it was all going to end,

14:08.630 --> 14:10.350
why did she act like that?

14:13.600 --> 14:14.770
I believed her

14:17.060 --> 14:20.250
when she said we'll make it.

14:23.850 --> 14:25.610
Even if it's wretched hope,

14:27.290 --> 14:28.750
it's still hope.

14:34.660 --> 14:37.460
If you're calling Du-ho, he won't pick up.

14:43.530 --> 14:45.020
I hurt him

14:46.870 --> 14:48.390
as much as you did.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.150
What did you say?

14:51.150 --> 14:52.510
Does that matter?

14:56.710 --> 14:58.390
I won't sign on alone.

15:01.930 --> 15:02.930
Why didn't you

15:04.400 --> 15:06.740
answer when CEO Ma asked if he could

15:07.580 --> 15:08.990
sign me on instead?

15:09.700 --> 15:12.600
I didn't mention it yesterday.

15:13.390 --> 15:14.750
I'm not that cruel.

15:15.350 --> 15:17.610
I didn't want to drive you to a corner.

15:20.260 --> 15:21.980
It's a misunderstanding...

15:21.980 --> 15:23.410
No need for excuses.

15:24.730 --> 15:26.200
But I want to ask you a favor.

15:28.280 --> 15:30.280
If you're not staying, I will.

15:31.030 --> 15:31.710
What?

15:31.810 --> 15:34.900
Ask CEO Ma to sign me on instead.

15:36.680 --> 15:37.880
Please.

15:38.850 --> 15:40.780
Why don't you do it yourself?

15:43.060 --> 15:44.060
Myself?

15:45.950 --> 15:47.170
I did.

15:47.810 --> 15:50.060
I sang a song and did everything I could.

15:50.130 --> 15:51.130
But...

15:52.450 --> 15:53.450
No.

15:55.150 --> 15:57.260
He said it was bait to keep you on.

16:01.020 --> 16:03.750
He has become cold since I last saw him.

16:05.040 --> 16:06.560
He can now say things like that to my face.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.190
Elle.

16:07.190 --> 16:09.390
He says my character overlaps with Lune's.

16:10.580 --> 16:12.310
That's why I'm asking you.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.280
He'll listen to you.

16:15.280 --> 16:16.560
- Elle.
- I know.

16:16.760 --> 16:18.690
I have no pride and I'm selfish.

16:18.690 --> 16:20.370
But I have to survive.

16:20.820 --> 16:22.680
I'll do anything to survive.

16:23.520 --> 16:24.680
I have the right to survive.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.840
We all have the right to survive.

16:29.980 --> 16:33.600
You think Hyun-ji, Chae-ah and Stella will agree?

16:34.440 --> 16:36.660
Haven't you ever thought you were

16:37.180 --> 16:38.180
losing out?

16:46.490 --> 16:47.850
Wow, what's this?

16:47.890 --> 16:50.630
Are you competing to see who's the worst?

16:51.550 --> 16:54.710
This is a total disaster.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.290
A backstabber

16:57.290 --> 16:59.640
and a leech sponging off of her.

16:59.640 --> 17:01.740
Which one's worse?

17:03.080 --> 17:04.480
So, is that true?

17:05.200 --> 17:06.880
You didn't answer when asked

17:07.599 --> 17:09.800
if she could stay instead of you?

17:10.310 --> 17:11.310
Why?

17:12.010 --> 17:13.280
Why didn't you answer?

17:13.710 --> 17:14.980
Out of spite?

17:15.760 --> 17:16.760
I know.

17:16.970 --> 17:20.369
You don't want others to have the spot.

17:21.369 --> 17:23.640
The winner is the least worst one.

17:24.770 --> 17:27.099
Elle was always like this.

17:27.099 --> 17:28.830
At least she's consistent.

17:29.390 --> 17:32.400
She's the same inside and out. No surprises.

17:33.060 --> 17:34.060
But

17:34.920 --> 17:36.180
you...

17:37.040 --> 17:40.020
You act like such a goodie-two-shoes.

17:40.550 --> 17:43.810
Then stab our backs at the most crucial moment.

17:43.870 --> 17:46.200
So you win the worst person battle.

17:47.670 --> 17:49.190
I have no reason

17:49.550 --> 17:51.780
to listen to insults from you, at least.

17:53.360 --> 17:53.700
What?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.530
Whatever you say, I did my best.

17:57.590 --> 17:58.970
But what did you do?

17:59.140 --> 18:00.420
You always got drunk.

18:00.420 --> 18:01.180
You got violent.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.840
You talked trash, and blamed me.

18:02.840 --> 18:04.260
That's all you do.

18:04.260 --> 18:08.050
You blame me for the world being like this.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.440
That's all you do.

18:10.990 --> 18:11.990
Am I wrong?

18:14.630 --> 18:15.630
What?

18:18.310 --> 18:19.310
Oh Hyun-ji.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.440
Listen up.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.440
I'm not your mom.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.990
She put up with you for a long time.

18:45.110 --> 18:46.510
Oh, hello.

18:46.510 --> 18:47.540
I'm sorry.

18:47.770 --> 18:49.180
I came a bit early.

18:49.180 --> 18:50.400
CEO Ma is on his way.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.670
You can wait in his office.

18:51.670 --> 18:53.180
I'll wait in the conference room.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.530
Let me know when he arrives.

18:54.750 --> 18:56.200
Okay. Let's go.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.200
Your amateurish empathy

19:07.730 --> 19:09.300
was so pathetic.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.210
I'm such a fool...

19:25.940 --> 19:26.940
Du-ho!

19:32.270 --> 19:33.550
What are you doing here?

19:33.550 --> 19:34.750
Why aren't you picking up?

19:35.690 --> 19:36.940
Why are you here?

19:36.940 --> 19:38.820
Don't be like that.

19:39.950 --> 19:41.620
It was wrong of me to do that.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.300
You did nothing wrong.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.050
You came to meet CEO Ma?

19:48.500 --> 19:49.620
He's not here.

19:50.340 --> 19:52.090
What are you going to say to him?

19:52.800 --> 19:54.530
I'm going to persuade him.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.750
That's all

19:57.300 --> 19:58.900
that you and I have.

19:59.870 --> 20:00.870
Persuading

20:02.400 --> 20:03.400
and begging.

20:07.320 --> 20:08.320
Do you have

20:08.920 --> 20:10.640
anything on CEO Ma?

20:11.360 --> 20:12.820
Let's threaten him.

20:12.840 --> 20:15.460
Other agents would've done whatever they could.

20:15.750 --> 20:17.100
That's what a professional does.

20:17.100 --> 20:18.380
Are you serious?

20:18.640 --> 20:19.640
Yeah.

20:20.650 --> 20:21.650
That's it.

20:23.670 --> 20:24.670
Go home.

20:24.890 --> 20:26.750
What are you going to do?

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
Hello.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.820
What are you doing?

21:06.820 --> 21:07.970
Ignore me and leave.

21:08.040 --> 21:09.040
What's this?

21:09.090 --> 21:11.860
The rumor about Lune smoking weed isn't a rumor.

21:11.860 --> 21:14.280
There will be evidence they tried to hide.

21:14.360 --> 21:15.550
I'm going to bargain with CEO Ma.

21:15.550 --> 21:16.450
Are you insane?

21:16.450 --> 21:17.430
I'm sane as ever!

21:17.610 --> 21:18.580
This is how you do a job.

21:18.580 --> 21:20.380
Why would he put that here?

21:20.410 --> 21:22.370
Butt out. This is my job!

21:22.370 --> 21:23.650
Get a grip!

21:23.650 --> 21:24.650
Stop interfering!

21:24.650 --> 21:25.350
Get out.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.260
Hey!

21:27.700 --> 21:29.660
What are you doing here? Huh?

21:31.650 --> 21:33.250
What are you hiding?

21:33.430 --> 21:34.320
Nothing.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.730
Nothing? Give it here.

21:36.270 --> 21:37.610
First Half of 2021 Operation Expenses Itemized Statement

21:40.430 --> 21:41.650
Du-ho. What's this?

21:41.950 --> 21:43.630
Huh? Jenna. What's this?

21:43.770 --> 21:44.810
What is this?

21:44.940 --> 21:46.620
What were you doing here?

21:46.990 --> 21:48.510
I made the request.

21:50.890 --> 21:53.510
I thought I left my file here the other time.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.780
I asked Du-ho to find it for me.

21:58.510 --> 22:00.110
I had a photo shoot.

22:00.950 --> 22:01.990
Sorry, Du-ho.

22:02.220 --> 22:04.510
I think I left it in my studio.

22:05.410 --> 22:06.870
Still, how can you barge in

22:06.870 --> 22:07.850
the CEO's room like this? Huh?

22:07.850 --> 22:10.210
But you barged in here, too.

22:12.270 --> 22:14.710
You think I'm the same as them? Huh?

22:17.290 --> 22:19.030
- Sorry.
- Okay.

22:20.510 --> 22:21.510
Say hello.

22:22.060 --> 22:23.660
This is CEO Cha Jae-hyuk.

22:24.310 --> 22:25.610
Our company went through

22:25.610 --> 22:27.460
an organizational reshuffle.

22:27.580 --> 22:28.900
He's the co-president

22:28.900 --> 22:30.070
of our Starpeace...

22:30.070 --> 22:32.740
CEO Ma must be losing his mind.

22:37.470 --> 22:39.540
He's a poor judge of character.

22:41.270 --> 22:42.550
Hey! Seo Ji-han!

22:44.950 --> 22:46.560
It's been a long time.

22:47.220 --> 22:48.710
For a greeting in a long time,

22:49.440 --> 22:51.170
you're being too aggressive.

23:01.320 --> 23:02.600
What's going on?

23:09.030 --> 23:10.310
Hey, Seo Ji-han!

23:12.610 --> 23:14.690
What's that attitude with CEO Cha?

23:14.690 --> 23:16.110
When does my contract expire?

23:16.330 --> 23:17.210
Contract?

23:17.480 --> 23:18.450
Why?

23:19.040 --> 23:19.770
To stab our backs?

23:19.770 --> 23:21.700
Who stabbed whose back first?

23:22.650 --> 23:24.050
Bringing that jerk was a stab in the back.

23:24.050 --> 23:25.650
Watch your language.

23:26.280 --> 23:27.660
We didn't know you two knew each other.

23:27.660 --> 23:29.630
How could that be back-stabbing?

23:29.730 --> 23:30.810
Your unreasonableness

23:31.070 --> 23:32.090
is also top level.

23:32.090 --> 23:34.730
What kind of company can't even catch that?

23:34.760 --> 23:35.760
Anyway,

23:35.900 --> 23:37.770
if he's here, I'm not renewing my contract.

23:40.290 --> 23:41.330
I wish I were

23:42.920 --> 23:45.070
a more presentable person.

23:45.370 --> 23:47.130
No matter what anyone says,

23:47.640 --> 23:50.170
you're the most valuable person to us.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.640
Thank you, Ji-han.

24:09.060 --> 24:10.060
Excuse me!

24:13.880 --> 24:15.560
Can you listen to this?

24:17.010 --> 24:18.140
Tell me what you think.

24:27.150 --> 24:28.100
Oh, Jenna.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.500
Oh, pretty boy.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.500
Hello.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.740
Here.

24:33.410 --> 24:35.650
Our company launched a cosmetics brand.

24:35.650 --> 24:36.960
These are promotional goods.

24:36.960 --> 24:38.640
I pocketed some for you.

24:40.740 --> 24:41.740
Thank you.

24:41.760 --> 24:42.760
Pretty boy.

24:43.290 --> 24:44.590
You'll turn a blind eye, right?

24:47.480 --> 24:48.480
Thank you.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.300
Use it well, okay?

24:54.700 --> 24:55.750
Did you meet Ji-han

24:55.750 --> 24:58.260
at Triple Entertainment in the US?

24:59.010 --> 24:59.850
Yes.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.250
As you saw,

25:02.420 --> 25:04.300
we parted ways with unresolved feelings.

25:04.660 --> 25:05.770
That's a shame.

25:06.470 --> 25:09.370
That was when you were at Winner Investment.

25:09.420 --> 25:12.380
An investment company executive and a trainee...

25:12.610 --> 25:14.920
It'd be hard to find a point of agreement.

25:16.860 --> 25:17.860
Right.

25:20.430 --> 25:21.280
CEO's Office

25:31.230 --> 25:32.230
Excuse me...

25:33.570 --> 25:35.700
If you're going to talk about earlier,

25:35.700 --> 25:36.540
forget it.

25:36.540 --> 25:38.110
I'm not interested in it now.

25:39.050 --> 25:40.250
Hey, Mr. Logan.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.190
Hey, how are you?

25:48.130 --> 25:50.190
Okay, I will talk to you later.

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
Yes. Bye.

25:59.260 --> 26:00.540
What do you want?

26:03.360 --> 26:05.210
If you're not interested in it now,

26:05.460 --> 26:07.930
will you be interested in it later?

26:08.590 --> 26:09.230
Yes.

26:09.470 --> 26:12.130
The talk on the roof had nothing to do with this.

26:12.130 --> 26:13.130
Kim Jenna.

26:14.090 --> 26:15.690
You're bad at lying.

26:16.510 --> 26:18.650
You're Kim Jenna of Cotton Candy, right?

26:19.370 --> 26:21.090
Jin Du-ho clearly did something

26:21.090 --> 26:22.560
to harm the company.

26:22.850 --> 26:24.530
As the person in charge,

26:24.660 --> 26:26.080
I can't overlook this.

26:26.540 --> 26:27.740
Do you have proof?

26:27.850 --> 26:28.850
Kim Jenna.

26:29.180 --> 26:30.310
I don't want to

26:30.310 --> 26:32.780
spend my time on something so trivial.

26:32.780 --> 26:33.780
Say

26:34.210 --> 26:35.810
what you really want to say.

26:36.260 --> 26:37.500
What I really want to say?

26:37.500 --> 26:39.350
I talked about the disbanding matter

26:39.350 --> 26:41.020
with one of your members.

26:41.070 --> 26:42.560
Hear what I said from her.

26:43.710 --> 26:45.180
You're mistaken.

26:47.890 --> 26:50.060
There's only one person who has the right

26:50.200 --> 26:51.830
to determine the future of our group.

26:52.520 --> 26:54.490
If I'm to appeal to someone, it'd be him.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.120
I see.

27:00.180 --> 27:01.760
Then you have no business

27:01.810 --> 27:03.120
with me now.

27:04.120 --> 27:05.990
I look forward to next time.

27:24.580 --> 27:25.580
Here.

27:25.630 --> 27:26.630
Thank you.

27:31.160 --> 27:33.360
Let's take this to the next level.

27:33.360 --> 27:34.610
- Let's sing together.
- Hey, hey, hey!

27:34.610 --> 27:35.920
I don't want to hear from you.

27:35.920 --> 27:37.610
Why, Chief?

27:38.050 --> 27:39.440
You said you're an idol singer.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.460
A singer must sing a song.

27:42.340 --> 27:44.320
Then I'll sing one of our songs.

27:44.320 --> 27:45.600
Not kids' songs.

27:46.650 --> 27:47.860
"Longing Only Grows Deeper."

27:47.860 --> 27:48.860
Sing that.

27:49.840 --> 27:50.470
What?

27:50.470 --> 27:51.350
You...

27:51.430 --> 27:53.610
Did you know you have a tear-jerking face?

27:53.610 --> 27:56.350
Quit being an idol singer and shift genres.

27:56.640 --> 27:57.390
You know,

27:57.610 --> 28:00.160
with your face, you'll go at least half way.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.340
Come on, Chief!

28:03.450 --> 28:05.650
Stella is a total idol singer image!

28:05.650 --> 28:07.710
I have an eye for these things.

28:08.690 --> 28:10.330
And your idol group failed, right?

28:10.660 --> 28:11.490
Also,

28:12.290 --> 28:13.720
you're a bit old, right?

28:21.970 --> 28:27.720
You were sweet, did you forget me?

28:28.870 --> 28:33.670
Have you already forgotten me?

28:36.050 --> 28:42.210
Leaving me to long for you, did you forget me?

28:43.290 --> 28:48.340
Have you already forgotten me?

28:50.600 --> 28:57.070
Who do you love right now?

28:58.100 --> 29:02.750
Did the firm promise change?

29:05.390 --> 29:12.300
We used to love each other

29:13.170 --> 29:18.290
Did your heart change?

29:21.760 --> 29:26.270
Is parting ways so easy?

29:28.210 --> 29:30.740
Just because time passed by

29:31.850 --> 29:33.950
Are you forsaking me?

29:33.140 --> 29:37.110
CEO Ma Jin-woo

29:33.950 --> 29:40.390
And leaving far away?

29:40.900 --> 29:45.170
Oh, I didn't know

29:45.490 --> 29:48.230
That your heart would change

29:49.950 --> 29:54.910
I really didn't know

29:56.410 --> 30:02.770
I lived only trusting you

30:04.480 --> 30:09.530
I only trusted you

30:10.810 --> 30:17.600
I miss you, what will I do?

30:19.120 --> 30:24.940
Longing only grows deeper

30:36.080 --> 30:37.160
Should I leave?

30:40.720 --> 30:41.720
I never

30:42.330 --> 30:44.110
asked you to be my mom.

31:00.120 --> 31:01.720
I saw Du-ho earlier.

31:02.080 --> 31:04.300
He was drinking alone at a convenience store.

31:05.610 --> 31:06.840
I've never seen him like that.

31:07.260 --> 31:08.530
What about the song?

31:09.210 --> 31:11.150
What's with the monitoring all of a sudden?

31:11.990 --> 31:13.620
If Bbiyong finds out, he'll freak out.

31:20.490 --> 31:21.670
Hello.

31:38.660 --> 31:40.110
Are you traveling somewhere?

31:45.590 --> 31:47.350
Did you listen to the memory stick?

31:48.400 --> 31:49.300
Oh...

31:49.980 --> 31:50.980
I'm sorry.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.220
I didn't get a chance to.

31:54.100 --> 31:56.290
It's a candidate for our title song for our unit.

31:57.670 --> 31:58.910
Can you monitor it?

31:59.730 --> 32:01.090
Why me...?

32:02.010 --> 32:03.450
Since we're colleagues...

32:07.000 --> 32:08.800
You seem to have outstanding sense.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.080
"Honest" in Cotton Candy's first album.

32:25.150 --> 32:26.830
You wrote that, right?

32:28.650 --> 32:29.650
I'm hooked.

32:32.150 --> 32:34.360
It's different from your music style.

32:34.850 --> 32:36.700
That doesn't mean I can't recognize a good song.

32:38.740 --> 32:41.210
There's something that I want but don't have.

32:43.050 --> 32:44.020
In your song.

32:44.020 --> 32:44.930
What is it?

32:44.930 --> 32:45.970
I don't know.

32:46.260 --> 32:47.760
If I knew, I'd be a genius.

32:53.760 --> 32:54.970
Are you busy right now?

32:55.750 --> 32:56.750
Come in.

33:06.460 --> 33:07.400
Are you hungry?

33:07.440 --> 33:08.520
I'm okay.

33:28.130 --> 33:31.600
I'm getting more curious today

33:32.480 --> 33:36.010
In search of the meaning of that hot moment

33:36.320 --> 33:39.370
In the notepad I can't erase

33:39.400 --> 33:40.160
What do you think?

33:40.160 --> 33:41.130
I hid you deep

33:41.150 --> 33:41.940
It's good.

33:41.940 --> 33:43.250
Like a secret

33:43.250 --> 33:44.800
Thanks to you...

33:47.800 --> 33:49.330
Why did you turn it off?

33:51.380 --> 33:52.570
You really think it's good?

33:54.700 --> 33:55.510
Yes.

33:56.630 --> 33:58.510
I did my best to help you.

34:07.460 --> 34:08.570
It's good.

34:10.750 --> 34:11.750
But...

34:12.250 --> 34:14.080
It's too pretty.

34:18.719 --> 34:20.330
I don't know for sure

34:20.330 --> 34:22.570
but I think it can be a bit rough.

34:28.300 --> 34:29.210
So...

34:30.520 --> 34:33.000
It sounds a bit pretty right now.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.330
But

34:36.030 --> 34:37.510
Like this...

34:39.300 --> 34:40.840
Can you play it again?

34:50.889 --> 34:54.360
I'm getting more curious today

34:55.250 --> 34:58.900
In search of the meaning of that hot moment

34:59.130 --> 35:02.560
In the notepad I can't erase

35:03.220 --> 35:05.970
I hid you deep like a secret

35:05.970 --> 35:07.020
Thanks to you...

35:15.660 --> 35:19.260
I'm getting more curious today

35:20.100 --> 35:23.760
In search of the meaning of that hot moment

35:23.910 --> 35:27.340
In the notepad I can't erase

35:28.110 --> 35:30.860
I hid you deep like a secret

35:30.860 --> 35:36.100
Thanks to you, I know my true heart

35:36.100 --> 35:38.550
It's more beautiful

35:38.900 --> 35:43.280
I have no ideal, Your language

35:43.280 --> 35:46.760
Lingers in my heart

35:47.180 --> 35:48.670
And baby it's like

35:48.710 --> 35:52.410
Side by side, next to you, with the same tempo

35:53.090 --> 35:57.020
Walking in step with you, our harmony will echo

35:57.030 --> 36:02.440
People come and go, but I will never let go

36:02.680 --> 36:04.130
I know it baby

36:05.820 --> 36:09.740
Open your closed heart

36:09.910 --> 36:13.780
One, two, three, fill it with us

36:14.390 --> 36:19.440
Create endless love

36:19.730 --> 36:22.160
And I'm talking to the moon

36:28.100 --> 36:29.830
Oh, baby

36:29.890 --> 36:36.490
May it shine brighter on our tomorrow

36:36.490 --> 36:38.240
I pray

36:43.500 --> 36:44.500
What?

36:46.480 --> 36:48.080
She packed her bags and left.

36:49.330 --> 36:50.690
Tell it straight!

36:51.880 --> 36:53.460
Give it!

36:55.470 --> 36:56.470
Alright!

36:56.930 --> 36:58.390
I kicked her out!

36:58.970 --> 36:59.970
Happy?

37:00.120 --> 37:01.800
Who do you think you are to kick her out?

37:01.860 --> 37:03.460
Where would she go right now?

37:03.460 --> 37:05.130
A lot of places!

37:06.960 --> 37:09.140
She has her mom and dad!

37:09.180 --> 37:10.920
She has her own home!

37:10.920 --> 37:12.330
Oh, and another thing!

37:12.400 --> 37:15.480
With one phone call, CEO Ma will save her.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.290
I wonder how she dazzled him.

37:26.090 --> 37:28.700
I should've asked and then kicked her out.

37:30.780 --> 37:32.650
So I can use it on him, too.

37:44.080 --> 37:45.770
You're a real low life.

37:45.980 --> 37:48.240
I thought you were just immature and reckless.

37:49.570 --> 37:51.700
I didn't know you were so crass.

37:58.040 --> 37:59.410
Why didn't you know?

38:01.740 --> 38:03.800
I was always like this!

38:04.770 --> 38:07.530
I'm the lowest of the low!

38:09.220 --> 38:10.420
What about you?

38:10.570 --> 38:11.920
Aren't you like me as well?

38:11.950 --> 38:12.950
And Elle?

38:13.260 --> 38:14.640
Hyun-ji!

38:15.130 --> 38:17.930
You know what this crappy situation means?

38:20.110 --> 38:23.750
It means we're going back to those crappy days!

38:25.340 --> 38:26.340
No.

38:27.360 --> 38:29.170
Not Chae-ah or Jenna.

38:44.700 --> 38:45.850
Jenna (Kim Jenna)

38:47.080 --> 38:47.880
Elle (Kang Yu-ri)

38:51.990 --> 38:53.520
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position

39:08.040 --> 39:09.040
Here.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.480
When I get older,

39:31.620 --> 39:33.250
I'm going to sell tteokbokki.

39:49.290 --> 39:51.030
What are you listening to?

39:56.710 --> 39:57.830
Amy Winehouse.

40:01.280 --> 40:02.280
Oh.

40:02.340 --> 40:03.950
She was my first love.

40:05.020 --> 40:05.900
Come eat.

40:09.640 --> 40:11.420
I was a bit precocious.

40:13.470 --> 40:15.150
Do you like spicy food?

40:20.030 --> 40:21.030
Thank you.

40:22.220 --> 40:22.980
Huh?

40:30.680 --> 40:33.930
Why is...this...here?

40:34.990 --> 40:35.770
What is it?

40:35.770 --> 40:36.910
Oh, this...

40:37.540 --> 40:38.650
Hold on.

40:45.810 --> 40:46.550
Hello?

40:46.550 --> 40:48.080
Oh, uh... Kim Jenna?

40:48.430 --> 40:49.120
Yes?

40:49.410 --> 40:51.770
Oh, uh... This is Cha Jae-hyuk.

40:54.310 --> 40:55.310
Do you

40:55.780 --> 40:57.560
have my fountain pen?

40:58.240 --> 40:58.970
Oh.

40:59.450 --> 41:00.650
Yes, well...

41:00.980 --> 41:02.780
I don't know why it's here.

41:03.290 --> 41:04.410
Where are you?

41:04.930 --> 41:05.700
What?

41:06.110 --> 41:07.780
Oh, uh...

41:08.980 --> 41:10.520
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

41:10.520 --> 41:11.520
No, no, no.

41:11.680 --> 41:14.210
I take the first flight out of Korea.

41:21.630 --> 41:23.040
Don't see what the fuss is about.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.570
He says it's very important.

41:25.620 --> 41:27.280
He says he can't lose it.

41:28.240 --> 41:29.930
Oh, that...

41:32.330 --> 41:33.330
But

41:34.180 --> 41:35.350
that jerk only considers

41:35.350 --> 41:36.740
what he can sell important.

41:38.460 --> 41:40.260
How do you know each other?

41:45.150 --> 41:46.250
I'm here.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.600
I'm coming in!

41:58.340 --> 42:01.150
I didn't know you were the monitor.

42:12.950 --> 42:14.810
I'm in a bit of a pickle.

42:14.810 --> 42:16.300
She'll be staying here for a few days.

42:18.430 --> 42:19.630
What are you talking about?

42:19.630 --> 42:20.630
No.

42:20.880 --> 42:22.260
You have nowhere else to go.

42:22.960 --> 42:24.810
It's better to stay here than the office.

42:25.550 --> 42:27.320
I'll be staying at home for a few days.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.050
So this studio will be empty.

42:29.390 --> 42:30.540
Does CEO Ma know?

42:30.750 --> 42:32.760
He doesn't need to know everything.

42:32.940 --> 42:33.940
Ji-han.

42:34.320 --> 42:35.950
What are you talking about?

42:36.590 --> 42:38.090
Colleagues should help each other out.

42:38.090 --> 42:39.610
I never asked you for this kind of help.

42:39.610 --> 42:40.850
Where are you going at this hour?

42:41.280 --> 42:42.280
A dry sauna?

42:42.330 --> 42:43.330
Seo Ji-han.

42:44.560 --> 42:46.120
It's not your place to wonder.

42:46.920 --> 42:48.340
I'll get you a hotel.

42:49.470 --> 42:51.160
There's a good place nearby.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.540
I'll make a reservation.

42:52.760 --> 42:54.170
Spend the night there.

42:54.190 --> 42:55.290
That's okay.

43:13.930 --> 43:14.900
What's going on?

43:15.360 --> 43:16.360
I told you.

43:16.720 --> 43:18.470
Colleagues should help each other out.

43:20.080 --> 43:21.920
Why the sudden interest?

43:22.580 --> 43:24.210
You didn't even know Cotton Candy.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.240
I got interested.

43:27.870 --> 43:28.600
Why?

43:28.600 --> 43:30.600
I came to know a lot of stuff.

43:31.050 --> 43:32.050
So?

43:32.190 --> 43:33.470
I'm going to be her friend.

43:34.920 --> 43:35.920
Friend?

43:38.490 --> 43:39.490
That's all?

43:47.100 --> 43:48.750
It's not what you think. Don't worry.

43:50.530 --> 43:52.170
I know how to take care of my team.

43:52.850 --> 43:53.990
Keep your promise.

44:08.520 --> 44:08.930
Hyun-ji!

44:08.930 --> 44:10.410
- Chae-ah?
- Where's CEO Ma?

44:10.410 --> 44:12.920
Jenna, Hyun-ji has gone crazy!

44:12.950 --> 44:14.430
This won't change anything!

44:14.430 --> 44:16.030
Tell CEO Ma to come out!

44:22.490 --> 44:24.460
Sir, can you pull over here?

44:24.510 --> 44:25.510
Okay.

44:25.940 --> 44:26.940
Thank you.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.120
Kim Jenna.

44:31.320 --> 44:32.320
Kim Jenna!

44:38.790 --> 44:41.130
Sir, can you follow that taxi?

44:41.130 --> 44:42.130
Okay.

44:47.950 --> 44:48.620
Hello...

44:48.980 --> 44:49.980
Hello?

44:52.860 --> 44:53.760
Hello?

44:54.610 --> 44:56.690
Hello? Kim Jenna?

45:02.310 --> 45:04.140
The phone has been turned off.

45:04.170 --> 45:05.990
Please leave a message.

45:06.010 --> 45:07.610
Unbelievable!

45:19.950 --> 45:20.950
Jenna!

45:23.710 --> 45:26.380
She says she'll kill CEO Ma and herself!

45:26.860 --> 45:27.980
Du-ho is here.

45:33.460 --> 45:34.460
Kim Jen....

45:39.940 --> 45:42.850
Let go! CEO Ma and Jenna are the same!

45:42.850 --> 45:46.680
- Hyun-ji! Pull yourself together!
- You're the same, too!

45:46.680 --> 45:48.150
I'm sorry.

45:48.250 --> 45:49.760
Hyun-ji! Pull yourself together!

45:49.760 --> 45:50.760
Oh Hyun-ji.

45:51.290 --> 45:52.430
Oh Hyun-ji!

45:54.300 --> 45:55.240
What?

45:55.240 --> 45:56.380
Why are you here?

45:56.620 --> 45:59.080
I said if you don't leave, then I will!

45:59.120 --> 46:00.120
Let go!

46:00.430 --> 46:02.690
I'm going out. Let go!

46:03.650 --> 46:04.810
Hyun-ji!

46:04.920 --> 46:06.600
- Let go!
- Oh Hyun-ji!

46:08.220 --> 46:10.250
Let go! No!

46:13.880 --> 46:15.260
Jenna! Jenna!

46:16.420 --> 46:18.100
- Open up!
- Jenna!

46:18.470 --> 46:19.690
- Jenna!
- Jenna!

46:19.690 --> 46:20.940
I'm leaving!

46:20.990 --> 46:22.330
- Jenna!
- Let go!

46:22.350 --> 46:23.470
Jenna!

46:24.790 --> 46:27.480
- Jenna! What are you doing?
- Let go!

46:28.330 --> 46:29.120
Jenna!

46:29.150 --> 46:30.290
Open the door!

46:32.160 --> 46:33.740
Kim Jenna!

46:34.040 --> 46:35.980
The phone has been turned off.

46:36.130 --> 46:37.410
Please leave a message...

46:40.670 --> 46:41.790
What are you doing?

46:44.280 --> 46:45.660
What are you doing here?

46:49.650 --> 46:50.650
Let go!

46:53.310 --> 46:54.390
I'm leaving!

46:54.650 --> 46:58.380
Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji!

47:01.310 --> 47:05.660
Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji! Hyun-ji!

47:05.710 --> 47:06.900
Hyun-ji!

47:09.250 --> 47:11.080
Jenna! Jenna!

47:12.050 --> 47:13.360
Open up!

47:13.390 --> 47:13.980
Huh?

47:14.180 --> 47:15.180
Jenna!

47:16.200 --> 47:17.200
Jenna!

47:31.800 --> 47:32.800
Hyun-ji!

47:38.660 --> 47:39.880
Hyun-ji!

47:42.640 --> 47:43.800
Hyun-ji!

47:44.510 --> 47:45.510
Hyun-ji!

47:55.570 --> 47:56.570
Jenna.

47:57.640 --> 47:59.400
What are you doing?

48:08.360 --> 48:11.280
It's... It's all my fault.

48:20.450 --> 48:22.870
Every night...

48:25.610 --> 48:28.050
I dream of this all ending.

48:30.220 --> 48:31.510
So...

48:32.130 --> 48:34.780
I was so scared of the morning.

48:37.660 --> 48:40.110
I was afraid today would disappear.

48:42.900 --> 48:43.900
So...

48:44.820 --> 48:47.790
When CEO Ma said he'll sign only me on,

48:47.800 --> 48:49.800
I guess I wanted to grasp onto that.

48:52.190 --> 48:54.310
Every day, I was scared.

48:54.980 --> 48:57.250
Because people kept saying.

48:57.540 --> 48:59.220
"It's all over."

48:59.500 --> 49:02.630
"But why can't you let go?"

49:04.650 --> 49:05.650
But...

49:07.660 --> 49:09.600
I don't know.

49:12.740 --> 49:15.200
I feel so sorry toward everyone.

49:16.560 --> 49:19.910
But I don't know why I can't let it go.

49:22.310 --> 49:24.570
I pretended like I knew everything

49:24.700 --> 49:27.340
and like I had plans, right?

49:30.680 --> 49:32.510
I deceived everyone.

49:33.380 --> 49:35.700
I'm so, so sorry.

49:38.750 --> 49:39.750
But...

49:43.650 --> 49:47.290
I don't think we should end like this.

49:53.880 --> 49:54.880
Being all

49:55.780 --> 49:57.380
torn to pieces,

49:57.990 --> 50:00.820
hating each other and bearing a grudge.

50:02.020 --> 50:04.550
I don't think we should end like this.

50:06.670 --> 50:09.820
I'm so sorry I made us like this.

51:08.320 --> 51:09.460

You're jealous of everything that's mine

51:47.530 --> 51:48.840
Foolish dumb

Every day, I shine

You wanna be me

52:00.070 --> 52:02.400

I'm sick of your calling

52:46.900 --> 52:49.400
Because of me, You got freeze, you losin your face

52:49.400 --> 52:50.170
Funny like that

52:50.170 --> 52:50.880
Hyun-ji!

52:50.880 --> 52:53.100
Even though you envy me (like that)

52:53.400 --> 52:54.090
Hey.

52:54.090 --> 52:55.270
You with the awkward wave.

52:55.270 --> 52:56.780
Come here and dance with me.

53:00.010 --> 53:01.510
One, two, three.

53:03.240 --> 53:04.040
But

53:04.250 --> 53:05.360
why dance to someone else's song?

53:05.360 --> 53:07.300
I don't know. I just want to.

53:07.770 --> 53:08.860
Foolish dumb

53:09.210 --> 53:10.860
Every day, I shine

53:10.980 --> 53:12.890
I'm shinin but you can't be

53:12.890 --> 53:14.850
Nice moves.

53:15.570 --> 53:17.640
You can't be me

53:18.520 --> 53:20.220
You wanna be me

53:20.220 --> 53:22.480
But you can't

53:22.570 --> 53:24.640
Keep being jealous

Hahahaha

53:26.680 --> 53:27.830
You're funny dawg

53:27.830 --> 53:28.730
I'm glad.

53:28.730 --> 53:31.780
A beautiful day you can't take your eyes off of

53:31.950 --> 53:35.400
I want it all, I know I'm so cool

53:35.700 --> 53:36.610
Can you do this?

53:37.300 --> 53:38.300
Of course.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.180
What about this?

53:40.430 --> 53:41.130
That?

53:41.300 --> 53:42.300
I can do it.

53:43.100 --> 53:43.860
This?

53:43.960 --> 53:44.750
And this?

53:44.770 --> 53:45.360
I can do it.

53:45.360 --> 53:46.390
Wow!

53:46.390 --> 53:48.130
When did you practice so much?

54:01.350 --> 54:02.350
Studio!

54:06.520 --> 54:07.520
Don't worry.

54:08.430 --> 54:09.360
I'll be going now.

54:10.230 --> 54:10.910
- Bye.
- No fighting.

54:10.910 --> 54:12.040
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

54:12.170 --> 54:13.260
Don't skip meals.

54:13.380 --> 54:14.770
- Okay, okay.
- Bye.

54:19.990 --> 54:20.870
Hyun-ji.

54:21.250 --> 54:22.350
I, uh...

54:22.390 --> 54:23.900
Oh, forget it.

54:23.900 --> 54:25.130
That's enough.

54:25.130 --> 54:26.570
I'm sorry, too.

54:27.640 --> 54:28.630
Seriously!

54:28.630 --> 54:30.310
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54:30.420 --> 54:31.670
Please forgive me.

54:31.670 --> 54:32.620
Happy?

54:32.630 --> 54:33.630
Yes.

54:34.510 --> 54:35.510
Then

54:35.990 --> 54:37.670
are we starting over?

54:40.700 --> 54:42.630
Whatever. Let's do it!

54:42.960 --> 54:43.960
Start over?

54:47.510 --> 54:49.430
What use is that now?

54:51.810 --> 54:53.780
You're such a buzz kill.

54:54.400 --> 54:57.340
I'm going to plant an apple tree before I die.

55:00.120 --> 55:01.800
You have CEO Cha's pen?

55:02.220 --> 55:02.880
What?

55:02.980 --> 55:05.280
He said don't lose it and give it to him later.

55:09.540 --> 55:10.540
Elle.

55:15.370 --> 55:16.810
What is she talking about?

55:17.410 --> 55:18.610
Who is CEO Cha?

55:22.000 --> 55:24.710
Did Director Yoon really okay using the studio?

55:24.710 --> 55:25.710
Jeez.

55:27.350 --> 55:28.760
Even though he berates us,

55:28.760 --> 55:30.050
he's the only one who

55:30.050 --> 55:31.160
takes care of Cotton...

55:31.160 --> 55:32.390
It wasn't him.

55:32.960 --> 55:34.540
It was the CEO's orders.

55:36.410 --> 55:37.410
What?

55:40.530 --> 55:41.530
Sir.

55:42.010 --> 55:44.780
If you do this, what does that make me?

55:47.560 --> 55:49.350
Why didn't you tell me about the studio issue?

55:49.820 --> 55:52.030
If I did, would you have permitted it?

55:52.180 --> 55:53.310
You're the one who told Du-ho

55:53.310 --> 55:54.700
to butt out of their business.

55:56.280 --> 55:58.490
Why did you change your mind all of a sudden?

55:59.670 --> 56:01.740
If I obediently take this song,

56:03.100 --> 56:04.420
what will you do for me?

56:06.950 --> 56:08.100
What do you want?

56:11.720 --> 56:13.000
Ridiculous.

56:13.140 --> 56:14.790
You're right, it's ridiculous.

56:17.260 --> 56:19.060
By the way, what did the doctor say?

56:19.970 --> 56:20.970
Jeez.

56:21.240 --> 56:22.870
It's the same thing every time.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.530
Stop smoking and drinking.

56:24.910 --> 56:26.510
Manage my stress level.

56:41.300 --> 56:41.960
Huh?

56:42.210 --> 56:42.870
Huh?

56:44.150 --> 56:45.020
Ji-han.

56:45.050 --> 56:46.070
Hi...

56:46.100 --> 56:47.220
Oh, hi.

56:47.620 --> 56:49.000
You two know each other?

56:49.840 --> 56:51.550
Yeah. In the US.

56:52.360 --> 56:53.890
We went to the same junior high.

56:53.980 --> 56:54.800
What?

56:59.460 --> 57:01.530
Why didn't you tell us that before?

57:07.230 --> 57:08.150
Right.

57:08.370 --> 57:10.240
I would've ignored him, too.

57:10.520 --> 57:12.920
A successful alum is so annoying.

57:22.520 --> 57:23.520
Hey.

57:28.150 --> 57:29.390
You're the chicken, right?

57:35.200 --> 57:36.880
I don't believe this.

57:37.780 --> 57:39.580
The rooster was Seo Ji-han?

57:43.330 --> 57:44.330
You crazy?

57:49.020 --> 57:49.850
Hyun-ji!

57:49.890 --> 57:51.520
Hey, Hyun-ji!

57:55.030 --> 57:56.690
I'm sorry about last night.

58:02.020 --> 58:03.440
Don't worry about it.

58:06.560 --> 58:07.640
Kim Jenna!

58:11.280 --> 58:14.320
And know your place.

58:24.010 --> 58:25.060
What's the rooster?

58:25.320 --> 58:26.410
Never mind.

58:26.960 --> 58:29.010
What were you thinking?

58:29.670 --> 58:32.010
I'm always left out in these things.

58:32.010 --> 58:32.960
Who's the rooster?

58:32.960 --> 58:33.760
No one.

58:38.560 --> 58:40.010
- Hello.
- Hello.

58:42.340 --> 58:43.400
It's been a long time.

58:43.460 --> 58:45.510
If you must disband us, then do it.

58:45.510 --> 58:47.010
But driving a wedge between us?

58:47.460 --> 58:48.220
You're an adult.

58:48.220 --> 58:49.950
You should be ashamed of yourself.

58:53.980 --> 58:55.050
Goodbye.

58:55.530 --> 58:56.530
Hey!

58:58.390 --> 58:59.280
Umm...

59:00.260 --> 59:01.180
Sir.

59:02.880 --> 59:04.510
Please give us another chance.

59:04.920 --> 59:07.010
Stella, we've finished discussing that.

59:07.010 --> 59:07.970
You didn't hear?

59:17.630 --> 59:19.200
Go, go, go.

59:33.160 --> 59:34.440
They replaced it.

59:35.290 --> 59:36.910
Is it a better one this time?

59:37.970 --> 59:40.490
How can the glass break because of a bag?

59:40.780 --> 59:42.460
Let's practice all night.

59:42.600 --> 59:43.520
Okay.

59:43.550 --> 59:45.670
There are groups that climbed back in the charts.

59:45.700 --> 59:46.700
Right!

59:47.030 --> 59:48.240
Let's get famous!

59:48.240 --> 59:49.720
And kick them in the butt, okay?

59:49.790 --> 59:50.950
- Okay!
- Okay!

59:50.980 --> 59:52.140
Let's do this! Let's go!

59:52.140 --> 59:55.580
Let's go!

1:00:13.570 --> 1:00:17.550
Can you feel this trembling?

1:00:17.680 --> 1:00:22.140
Do you feel the same way?

1:00:22.310 --> 1:00:27.210
Time has stopped as if I'm in a dream

1:00:28.360 --> 1:00:30.780
Is this love?

1:00:32.940 --> 1:00:34.440
I look around

1:00:34.440 --> 1:00:36.070
and lovers are everywhere

1:00:36.430 --> 1:00:40.380
I was sad that I was alone

1:00:42.180 --> 1:00:45.700
Then I saw you by my side

1:00:45.810 --> 1:00:49.650
Now I realize

1:00:49.670 --> 1:00:52.190
Into my small world

1:00:52.190 --> 1:00:54.330
You came like a big gift

1:00:54.330 --> 1:00:55.990
In a sparkling moment

1:00:56.010 --> 1:00:59.070
My white first love came to me

1:00:59.670 --> 1:01:01.920
Worried you might read my heart

1:01:02.100 --> 1:01:05.120
or how much I've been waiting for today

1:01:05.410 --> 1:01:08.460
I want your white day love

1:01:23.570 --> 1:01:24.530
Come on!

1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:29.360
Imagining walking with you

1:01:29.360 --> 1:01:31.830
My cheeks are flushed, I've found happiness

1:01:31.830 --> 1:01:33.390
Even if the path we're taking

1:01:33.390 --> 1:01:34.530
is momentarily different

1:01:34.530 --> 1:01:36.740
I hope we'll hold hands and walk together one day

1:01:36.740 --> 1:01:38.750
I can see us so pretty together

1:01:38.750 --> 1:01:41.900
I will be yours forever

1:01:42.080 --> 1:01:44.370
Come to me

1:01:47.470 --> 1:01:49.140
Trash can

1:01:49.160 --> 1:01:50.820
Kim Jenna / Hello, Sir. It's me, Jenna.

1:01:57.260 --> 1:01:58.670
Kim Jenna / Hello, Sir. It's me, Jenna.

1:01:58.670 --> 1:02:00.150
Recover

1:02:00.150 --> 1:02:01.720
Recovery complete

1:02:01.720 --> 1:02:03.480
Check

1:02:13.930 --> 1:02:14.930
Yes?

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:33.740
They're good, right, Sir?

1:02:35.680 --> 1:02:36.680
Yes.

1:02:40.920 --> 1:02:42.980
It reminded me of the old days.

1:02:45.110 --> 1:02:47.480
When you learned their dance moves

1:02:47.860 --> 1:02:49.540
and practiced together.

1:02:52.740 --> 1:02:54.540
What is it you want to say?

1:03:07.840 --> 1:03:09.520
Give them another chance.

1:03:12.160 --> 1:03:13.660
They're so good.

1:03:14.690 --> 1:03:16.170
How can you just send them away?

1:03:21.500 --> 1:03:24.100
You can't let attachment drag you around.

1:03:24.250 --> 1:03:27.010
It's good for their future to be firm...

1:03:27.010 --> 1:03:28.730
It's not because of attachment!

1:03:31.180 --> 1:03:32.360
It's because of their talent.

1:03:32.790 --> 1:03:33.830
You saw them.

1:03:34.760 --> 1:03:36.760
Just because they failed once,

1:03:37.010 --> 1:03:38.810
the company abandoned them.

1:03:39.760 --> 1:03:41.820
Is that failure only their fault?

1:03:42.540 --> 1:03:43.400
After debuting them,

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:45.080
they weren't properly supported!

1:03:45.590 --> 1:03:46.590
You...

1:03:47.580 --> 1:03:49.020
and the company! It's your fault, too!

1:03:49.020 --> 1:03:49.940
Hey!

1:03:49.940 --> 1:03:51.910
Just because Mars is making money right now,

1:03:51.910 --> 1:03:53.690
you tell them, "Be patient this year."

1:03:53.890 --> 1:03:55.470
"Be patient for another year."

1:03:55.560 --> 1:03:57.690
"When the company grows bigger..."

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:01.160
Putting things off, they've gotten older

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:03.500
and you replace them with younger kids!

1:04:04.440 --> 1:04:06.290
You all feign ignorance!

1:04:07.300 --> 1:04:09.830
Lending them a house for free makes up for it?

1:04:10.370 --> 1:04:12.970
Do you feel less sorry because of that?

1:04:13.120 --> 1:04:14.200
Hey, Jin Du-ho!

1:04:14.230 --> 1:04:15.230
Jin-woo!

1:04:18.700 --> 1:04:20.820
When we first met, you told me to call you that.

1:04:20.820 --> 1:04:22.140
But I didn't.

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:25.950
For the first and last time, I will.

1:04:30.510 --> 1:04:31.510
Jin-woo!

1:04:34.630 --> 1:04:36.480
You have the power to do it.

1:04:39.100 --> 1:04:41.010
When they debuted,

1:04:41.680 --> 1:04:44.530
you said they were your babies!

1:04:48.810 --> 1:04:50.490
Give them another chance!

1:04:51.910 --> 1:04:54.070
You can do it, Jin-woo.

1:05:00.550 --> 1:05:01.550
Du-ho...

1:05:07.230 --> 1:05:09.720
My body is not that light anymore.

1:05:13.800 --> 1:05:15.670
It can't be light.

1:05:20.890 --> 1:05:22.960
It must not be light.

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:26.600
Why?

1:05:45.630 --> 1:05:47.400
In my small hands

1:05:47.400 --> 1:05:50.380
I've been hiding my precious love

1:05:50.380 --> 1:05:51.960
To you shining brightly

1:05:51.960 --> 1:05:55.450
Today, I want my love to reach you

1:05:55.730 --> 1:05:58.060
Even if I'm clumsy and awkward,

1:05:58.060 --> 1:06:01.240
I hope you will come to me

1:06:01.240 --> 1:06:04.220
I'll be waiting for you

1:06:19.900 --> 1:06:22.080
We finally got a gig,

1:06:22.080 --> 1:06:23.520
but we have to ride an express bus?

1:06:24.300 --> 1:06:26.220
There she goes again.

1:06:26.510 --> 1:06:27.380
- Stella.
- Yeah?

1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:28.580
You got our MR?

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:30.340
Of course I brought it.

1:06:30.340 --> 1:06:31.690
I want walnut cake.

1:06:31.690 --> 1:06:32.550
Walnut cake?

1:06:32.570 --> 1:06:34.570
They'll have it, right?

1:06:35.830 --> 1:06:36.820
Wait for me!

1:06:36.820 --> 1:06:37.810
Hello? Du-ho.

1:06:37.900 --> 1:06:39.050
We're getting on the bus now.

1:06:39.050 --> 1:06:40.050
I'm sorry.

1:06:40.490 --> 1:06:41.770
Everything okay?

1:06:50.080 --> 1:06:51.990
Don't worry, Du-ho.

1:06:52.720 --> 1:06:54.850
We're going to a gig in another province.

1:06:54.850 --> 1:06:57.590
What agent makes their talent ride a bus?

1:06:58.380 --> 1:06:59.140
Seriously.

1:06:59.140 --> 1:07:01.490
Is Highteen coming back a day early on purpose?

1:07:01.820 --> 1:07:02.970
Has Seok-chun come?

1:07:03.870 --> 1:07:06.320
Who's Seok-chun?

1:07:07.690 --> 1:07:09.330
He said he'll be here soon.

1:07:10.300 --> 1:07:11.700
Don't worry.

1:07:11.980 --> 1:07:13.130
If you're late picking us up,

1:07:13.130 --> 1:07:14.460
you're so dead!

1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:15.880
Alright.

1:07:15.880 --> 1:07:16.880
Don't worry.

1:07:17.230 --> 1:07:19.570
I'll drop them off and go straight to you.

1:07:19.920 --> 1:07:20.920
Okay.

1:07:21.680 --> 1:07:23.360
I said I won't be late.

1:07:25.470 --> 1:07:26.600
Okay.

1:07:26.630 --> 1:07:27.460
Bye.

1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:40.490
Du-ho's hometown friend.

1:07:40.770 --> 1:07:41.660
Yeah.

1:07:41.720 --> 1:07:42.830
He wanted to be an agent like Du-ho

1:07:42.830 --> 1:07:44.360
and went to school for that.

1:07:44.440 --> 1:07:46.440
He's interning at Starpeace.

1:07:47.290 --> 1:07:48.290
Hello!

1:07:48.550 --> 1:07:49.910
I'm Go Seok-chun.

1:07:50.230 --> 1:07:51.400
I'm sorry I'm late.

1:07:51.400 --> 1:07:52.760
- Hello.
- Hello.

1:07:53.270 --> 1:07:54.710
Forget about that.

1:07:55.910 --> 1:07:57.930
So you're from the same town as Du-ho?

1:07:57.930 --> 1:07:58.730
Yes.

1:07:59.100 --> 1:08:00.240
Why

1:08:01.820 --> 1:08:03.760
are your names all like that?

1:08:04.620 --> 1:08:05.740
Daniel or

1:08:05.740 --> 1:08:07.450
Chris, Henry or Charles...

1:08:07.450 --> 1:08:08.740
Is there no one with those kinds of names?

1:08:08.740 --> 1:08:09.740
At least,

1:08:09.830 --> 1:08:11.200
"I am Tom?"

1:08:11.200 --> 1:08:13.350
Not again. Hyun-ji, please.

1:08:14.010 --> 1:08:16.010
You can sit here.

1:08:17.460 --> 1:08:19.939
I'll overlook this since it's your first time.

1:08:25.130 --> 1:08:26.810
Where are you from?

1:08:27.380 --> 1:08:28.890
I'm a friend of Du-ho's.

1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:31.229
I know that.

1:08:31.229 --> 1:08:32.750
Where are you from?

1:08:33.359 --> 1:08:34.020
The same...

1:08:34.020 --> 1:08:35.060
Where? Where?

1:08:46.830 --> 1:08:47.830
Yes, Sir.

1:08:47.970 --> 1:08:48.790
Hi.

1:08:49.740 --> 1:08:51.420
Are you going to Jicheon?

1:08:52.140 --> 1:08:53.420
How is everyone?

1:08:53.970 --> 1:08:55.170
We're all good.

1:08:55.800 --> 1:08:56.720
Great.

1:08:57.700 --> 1:08:59.770
Will it be evening when you return?

1:09:00.460 --> 1:09:01.720
Come by the office.

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:03.160
Let's have dinner.

1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:06.080
All of us together.

1:09:08.290 --> 1:09:09.290
Okay.

1:09:12.840 --> 1:09:14.229
Good luck with the performance.

1:09:15.850 --> 1:09:17.590
Tell Hyun-ji to keep her temper.

1:09:17.710 --> 1:09:19.149
Encourage Chae-ah.

1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:21.830
As always, do well.

1:09:23.660 --> 1:09:24.850
See you when you get back.

1:09:27.020 --> 1:09:28.020
Okay!

1:10:29.040 --> 1:10:30.040
Rain?

1:10:47.610 --> 1:10:50.430
25th Chungcheong Traditional Food Festival
Jicheon Residents Singing Contest

1:10:51.740 --> 1:10:52.740
Excuse me!

1:10:52.870 --> 1:10:53.820
Move out of the way!

1:10:53.890 --> 1:10:54.890
Let us pass!

1:10:55.310 --> 1:10:57.350
- Excuse me!
- Move, please. Seriously.

1:10:57.350 --> 1:10:58.910
Go over there! Over there!

1:10:58.990 --> 1:10:59.990
Jeez.

1:11:02.530 --> 1:11:03.530
Seriously!

1:11:04.080 --> 1:11:05.820
What's this?

1:11:06.340 --> 1:11:08.020
Jin Du-ho, that fool!

1:11:40.170 --> 1:11:41.210
Hurry, hurry.

1:11:41.280 --> 1:11:43.020
What are you doing? Hurry.

1:11:43.040 --> 1:11:44.710
Guest Singer: Cotton Candy

1:11:47.210 --> 1:11:49.040
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1:12:00.870 --> 1:12:02.770
Why does this keep happening to us?

1:12:02.770 --> 1:12:05.290
What did we do wrong?

1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.080
This is too harsh!

1:12:08.330 --> 1:12:09.500
It's raining hard.

1:12:09.500 --> 1:12:10.970
Is there no indoor stage?

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:12.340
No? Jeez.

1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:15.810
Go inside!

1:12:15.810 --> 1:12:16.810
Pull out!

1:12:20.190 --> 1:12:21.210
Are you alright?

1:12:21.210 --> 1:12:22.710
Do I look alright to you?

1:12:22.710 --> 1:12:24.160
What did the host say?

1:12:24.160 --> 1:12:26.390
There was forecast for rain,

1:12:26.630 --> 1:12:29.230
so they didn't reserve an indoor stage.

1:12:30.850 --> 1:12:34.160
Why does what Du-ho does always fall apart?

1:12:45.930 --> 1:12:47.950
What do we do now?

1:12:48.990 --> 1:12:50.190
No indoors?

1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:52.860
Indoors, my foot.

1:12:53.170 --> 1:12:54.630
Are you stupid?

1:12:54.630 --> 1:12:56.200
Hyun-ji, stop it.

1:12:56.200 --> 1:12:58.780
You're half the reason we failed!

1:12:58.780 --> 1:12:59.830
I'll be there soon.

1:12:59.830 --> 1:13:01.210
Go to a nearby coffee shop.

1:13:01.210 --> 1:13:03.850
There's no coffee shop in this countryside!

1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:06.240
Du-ho.

1:13:06.940 --> 1:13:08.140
It's dangerous.

1:13:08.320 --> 1:13:09.360
Drive slowly.

1:13:09.420 --> 1:13:10.290
Yeah.

1:13:10.290 --> 1:13:12.120
I'll find somewhere to go.

1:13:12.370 --> 1:13:13.370
It's okay.

1:13:14.730 --> 1:13:16.660
Come quickly! You're so dead!

1:13:56.570 --> 1:13:58.050
A long wait

1:13:59.640 --> 1:14:01.350
Seems endless

1:14:01.690 --> 1:14:03.370
Tomorrow is coming again

1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:05.720
Light and...

1:14:27.890 --> 1:14:28.890
Seriously!

1:14:29.140 --> 1:14:31.510
Just wait till he gets here.

1:15:34.770 --> 1:15:36.940
Hi, it's me. You busy?

1:15:38.540 --> 1:15:41.210
Yeah. Did you listen to what I sent you?

1:15:42.510 --> 1:15:43.510
Hey!

1:15:44.250 --> 1:15:45.700
What have you been doing?

1:15:47.640 --> 1:15:49.570
Listen to it right now and call me back.

1:15:50.350 --> 1:15:51.350
Yeah.

1:15:53.640 --> 1:15:55.800
How can he act busier than me?

1:16:05.800 --> 1:16:06.800
Hello?

1:16:10.550 --> 1:16:13.450
That wasn't the only reason I hired CEO Cha.

1:16:15.830 --> 1:16:16.870
Executive Kim.

1:16:16.890 --> 1:16:18.230
About going public.

1:16:18.230 --> 1:16:20.190
I told you several times that

1:16:20.190 --> 1:16:22.190
I'll think about it carefully.

1:16:23.230 --> 1:16:25.690
I'm not disregarding the investors...

1:16:28.990 --> 1:16:31.460
No, you don't have to come right now.

1:16:32.540 --> 1:16:33.540
Hello?

1:16:35.620 --> 1:16:36.680
Hello!

1:16:44.580 --> 1:16:46.010
Seriously.

1:16:46.010 --> 1:16:47.550
Unbelievable.

1:17:02.880 --> 1:17:04.120
No!

1:17:04.980 --> 1:17:05.980
No!

1:17:06.370 --> 1:17:07.560
Please!

1:17:11.980 --> 1:17:12.980
Sir!

1:17:13.140 --> 1:17:14.360
Sir! Sir!

1:17:14.880 --> 1:17:16.320
Come here! Quick!

1:17:17.080 --> 1:17:18.840
Sir! Sir!

1:17:19.090 --> 1:17:20.930
- Call 911!
- Sir!

1:17:28.910 --> 1:17:29.910
Jeez.

1:17:30.470 --> 1:17:32.550
Ow, ow, ow.

1:17:36.760 --> 1:17:39.800
That's dirty. It's acid rain.

1:17:45.600 --> 1:17:46.700
No!

1:17:56.070 --> 1:17:58.240
Please! Please!

1:18:10.540 --> 1:18:11.620
911, right?

1:18:11.660 --> 1:18:14.110
This is Starpeace. You have to come quick.

1:18:14.110 --> 1:18:17.180
Yes, it's an emergency. Come quickly!

1:18:40.910 --> 1:18:41.910
Seriously!

1:19:43.540 --> 1:19:44.540
My girls...

1:19:46.860 --> 1:19:48.540
What will happen to them?

1:20:16.060 --> 1:20:18.540
That chubby fool!

1:20:19.450 --> 1:20:21.480
I guess he has lazy bones as well.

1:20:21.530 --> 1:20:23.550
What's taking so long?

1:20:24.840 --> 1:20:26.700
Just wait till he gets here.

1:20:26.730 --> 1:20:29.270
I'm going to kick his potbelly in.

1:21:33.690 --> 1:21:36.220
IDOL
[IDOL: The Coup]

1:21:37.470 --> 1:21:38.740
Just go!

1:21:39.050 --> 1:21:40.990
Just go, Du-ho!

1:21:41.010 --> 1:21:43.140
Jenna. Please say something.

1:21:43.160 --> 1:21:45.760
Whatever she thinks, it's on her.

1:21:45.760 --> 1:21:47.440
I said it's all over.

1:21:47.440 --> 1:21:48.620
I can see now.

1:21:48.620 --> 1:21:50.840
The world pointing at us and mocking us.

1:21:55.730 --> 1:21:58.180
He said he'd see our performance, then decide?

1:21:58.180 --> 1:22:00.470
It might be our last chance.

1:22:00.640 --> 1:22:02.350
Your nature that wants to prove

1:22:02.350 --> 1:22:03.910
they don't even have 1% potential

1:22:03.910 --> 1:22:04.910
is the same, right?

1:22:04.980 --> 1:22:06.560
Then give us 3 months.

1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:08.090
If you can't do it in 3 days,

1:22:08.110 --> 1:22:09.680
you'll leave, stripped of everything.
