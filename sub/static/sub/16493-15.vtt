Uh-oh. We got a substitute.

00:52.208 --> 00:53.500
[Milo] What's the matter
with a substitute?

00:53.583 --> 00:54.709
[Zack] Nothing per se.

00:54.792 --> 00:56.166
It all depends on
what type you get.

00:56.250 --> 00:57.250
What do you mean?

00:57.333 --> 00:59.750
[Zack] Well,
you get your "try-too-hards."

00:59.834 --> 01:02.166

01:02.250 --> 01:03.792
[Zack] And your
"drill sergeants."

01:03.875 --> 01:05.166
You!
I'm gonna call you Brooklyn.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.709
- You from Brooklyn?
- No, sir!

01:06.792 --> 01:09.041
That's why it's gonna stick!

01:09.125 --> 01:10.959
Well, let's see what
we got this time.

01:11.041 --> 01:15.041
Good morning, students, I'm Ms.
Baxter, your substitute teacher.

01:15.125 --> 01:17.041
But can I really call
myself a teacher?

01:17.125 --> 01:19.750
Will I be able to teach you
anything in this brief interval

01:19.834 --> 01:21.041
where our lives overlap?

01:21.125 --> 01:23.875
And if I did,
how would I ever know?

01:24.000 --> 01:25.375
Oh. I forgot the third one.

01:25.458 --> 01:26.917
"The discouraged burnout."

01:27.000 --> 01:28.792
- [Melissa]Nice likeness.
- [Zack] Thanks.

01:28.875 --> 01:32.875
You know, I never thought about it before,
but being a substitute must be hard.

01:32.959 --> 01:34.792
- Maybe if I...
- Careful, Milo.

01:34.875 --> 01:36.917
Remember the last time
you "maybe if I"-ed?

01:37.000 --> 01:38.458
They had to call in
the National Guard.

01:38.542 --> 01:41.208
I know!
I got to hold a grenade launcher.

01:41.291 --> 01:45.125
Today I'll show you this moderately
accurate movie about exothermic reactions.

01:45.208 --> 01:46.834
[Milo] Excuse me, Ms. Baxter?

01:46.917 --> 01:49.583
Our school doesn't have the most
up-to-date audio-visual equipment.

01:49.667 --> 01:50.959
Do you have anything
that'll play on this?

01:51.041 --> 01:52.583
It's called a zoetrope.

01:52.667 --> 01:54.959
We also have a horse
jumping and one of a fish.

01:55.041 --> 01:57.834
And no one can figure
out what this one is.

01:58.083 --> 02:02.083
Well, I guess that means
I'll have to teach.

02:02.166 --> 02:05.250
You there, boy with the kind eyes,
you're my teacher's aide for the day.

02:05.333 --> 02:07.625
Cool! These glasses really work.

02:07.709 --> 02:12.250
Um, Ms. Baxter, you might want to put on
your safety goggles and take a step back.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.083
Like,
maybe all the way to Canada.

02:16.375 --> 02:18.250
Ah! We're here.

02:18.333 --> 02:21.125
Do you have the special pistachio
tree fertilizer from the future?

02:21.208 --> 02:22.750
Yeah, I got it. It's heavy too.

02:22.834 --> 02:26.291
Now, all we have to do is
find that pistachio plant.

02:26.375 --> 02:27.667
Why are we in a closet?

02:27.750 --> 02:30.125
I don't know. The Quantum
Localizer musta glitched again.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.000

02:33.083 --> 02:35.417
And now we don't know where we
are, or when!

02:35.500 --> 02:37.000
How are we going
to recharge this?

02:37.083 --> 02:39.417
Go outside and see if they've
discovered electricity yet.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.208
And that is how
a zoetrope works.

02:43.291 --> 02:44.500
Apparently.

02:45.709 --> 02:47.083
You're not gonna like this.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.959
What?
I think we're in the 1800's.

02:49.041 --> 02:51.333
- What!
- They got a zoetrope out there.

02:51.375 --> 02:53.333
But, you know,
they also had fluorescent lights.

02:53.417 --> 02:55.208
So, maybe we're just
in a public school.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.417
All right. It'll only take a minute
to charge, so let's find an outlet.

02:58.500 --> 03:01.166
But we must not call
attention to ourselves.

03:01.250 --> 03:03.250
Well, the next thing
I'm supposed to "teach"

03:03.333 --> 03:05.625
- is the three phases of matter.
- [door opening]

03:05.709 --> 03:07.291

[creaking resumes]

03:36.333 --> 03:40.000
Solid, liquid and gas.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.959
To demonstrate, Milo will mix
together baking soda, a solid,

03:44.041 --> 03:48.208
and vinegar, a liquid,
to produce carbon dioxide gas.

03:48.291 --> 03:50.208
Okay, everyone, goggles on.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.375
Right.
You don't need goggles for this.

03:53.458 --> 03:54.417

That's impossible.
It's endothermic.

Yeah, uh,

about rising up from under my desk?

04:48.959 --> 04:50.166
[Chad] Not to do it?

04:50.250 --> 04:51.417
All charged up.

I hear it's totally steep!

04:57.500 --> 05:00.166
I don't think this is
our Quantum Localizer.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.291

We need to add six
grams of diaminohexane.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.208

will neutralize the spill.
