00:36.500 --> 00:38.020
Here we bloody go again...

00:41.460 --> 00:45.010
Breathe your way through it, Joan,
breathe your way through it.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.090
Breathe through it.

00:47.140 --> 00:49.370
That's right, that's right!
Good girl.

00:49.420 --> 00:51.060
Good girl...

00:54.060 --> 00:55.100
That's right.

00:59.140 --> 01:03.370
'I saw a thousand dawns
when I was working in the East End.

01:03.420 --> 01:05.300
'A thousand fresh beginnings.

01:07.020 --> 01:08.540
'Every day a world made new.'

01:13.660 --> 01:16.250
'There were challenges
and changes but always

01:16.300 --> 01:19.050
'the sense of life forging forward,

01:19.100 --> 01:21.900
'pulsing like the River Thames
itself.'

01:27.620 --> 01:30.700
I know it's been a long night,
but you're doing so well.

01:31.900 --> 01:34.610
She ain't had nothing to eat
since dinner last night,

01:34.660 --> 01:36.420
it's no wonder she's weak.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.410
I brought her an iced bun.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.530
I hate iced buns.

01:41.580 --> 01:44.180
Not just now, Mrs Wiggs.
Maybe later.

01:46.300 --> 01:47.740
Do you want it?

01:50.620 --> 01:52.500
Actually, I'd love it.

01:58.780 --> 01:59.820
Mmm!

02:09.020 --> 02:11.730
I'm going to end up with
Sister Evangelina!

02:11.780 --> 02:13.020
Oh, look, there he is!

02:17.060 --> 02:20.290
Look at that!
Feels like home already!

02:20.340 --> 02:23.010
I always say,
it's the little things that count.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.860
We had hoped for a red carpet,
and a marching band!

02:26.900 --> 02:29.650
Where the bright Seraphim
in burning row

02:29.700 --> 02:32.570
Their loud uplifted
angel trumpets blow

02:32.620 --> 02:35.930
And the Cherubic host
of thousand choirs

02:35.980 --> 02:39.090
Touch their immortal harps
of golden wires!

02:39.140 --> 02:40.730
Hello, Sister Monica Joan.

02:40.780 --> 02:42.490
Are you settling in?

02:42.540 --> 02:44.930
Those who went before us
in this place

02:44.980 --> 02:48.060
have left a most vaporous trail.

02:49.420 --> 02:50.890
It's the smell of wet paint.

02:50.940 --> 02:52.380
But she won't be told.

02:54.660 --> 02:55.700
Thank you.

03:01.700 --> 03:05.370
Keep going! Good girl! Keep going!

03:05.420 --> 03:07.370
Good!

03:07.420 --> 03:09.650
Good things
come to those who wait, Joan!

03:09.700 --> 03:11.010
I can see the baby's head.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.010
I'm scared...

03:12.060 --> 03:15.290
You listen to the nurse, love.
She's done this hundred times.

03:15.340 --> 03:16.460
Haven't you?

03:17.540 --> 03:19.020
Absolutely.

03:36.140 --> 03:38.330
A little boy, Joan.

03:38.380 --> 03:39.580
And he's beautiful!

03:41.620 --> 03:43.420
Oh, Joan!

03:45.620 --> 03:48.970
'In textbooks there are no lessons
in digging deep,

03:49.020 --> 03:54.530
'in finding one last hour
of strength to see you through.

03:54.580 --> 03:58.140
'But in Poplar I learned all of this
and more.'

03:59.460 --> 04:01.340
There! Wasn't that all worth it?

04:03.260 --> 04:04.940
I could sleep for ever.

04:06.420 --> 04:09.020
And I don't care
if I never sleep again.

04:27.700 --> 04:28.770
Hello, Merle.

04:30.060 --> 04:32.370
Sounds like someone
wants his elevenses!

04:32.420 --> 04:35.250
"Someone" wants his elevenses
morning, noon and night.

04:35.300 --> 04:38.370
And if I ain't feeding him,
I'm changing his drawers.

04:38.420 --> 04:41.690
It can take a while for a baby to
get into a new routine.

04:41.740 --> 04:43.930
Was your other little boy
unsettled as a newborn?

04:43.980 --> 04:48.180
Ian? Not half! It's like I can't do
anything right, sometimes.

04:54.300 --> 04:56.220
Does Martin look all right to you?

05:04.060 --> 05:06.210
I can't see anything amiss.

05:06.260 --> 05:08.130
Why don't you
pop into our Tuesday clinic?

05:08.180 --> 05:10.250
We can give him
the once-over, if you're worried.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.170
I never know where they are, since
they knocked the Parish Hall down.

05:13.220 --> 05:16.370
I'm sorry. We're still on the hunt
for a permanent venue.

05:16.420 --> 05:19.460
But we're at the Seaman's Mission
next week. Do come.

05:20.580 --> 05:21.850
I'll try.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.940
If his nibs is less unsettled.

05:30.140 --> 05:32.450
Now, I've done
exactly what the book says,

05:32.500 --> 05:35.810
and rolled the pastry
into a rectangle!

05:35.860 --> 05:37.140
Rectangle.

05:39.940 --> 05:44.290
Next, I just dot the pastry with
a previously prepared paste

05:44.340 --> 05:47.540
of butter and lard, thus...

05:49.740 --> 05:53.050
Now I then fold the pastry over -

05:53.100 --> 05:55.410
like so!

05:55.460 --> 05:59.450
And then repeat the action
four times,

05:59.500 --> 06:03.650
whilst the pie filling simmers
on a low light!

06:11.060 --> 06:14.010
And one single titter from you,
young sir, and I'll take you

06:14.060 --> 06:17.220
to the mirror, and show you what
a naughty monkey looks like!

06:55.900 --> 06:57.690
Knock-knock!

06:57.740 --> 07:00.730
Guess what?
They've put us in together!

07:00.780 --> 07:04.330
We can shimmy to the Dansette every
night, like Pinky and Perky.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.890
Where's Cynthia?

07:05.940 --> 07:09.450
Well, they put her in the box
room at the end. We tossed a coin.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.730
You don't mind, do you?

07:10.780 --> 07:12.810
I've never heard anyone say
that I snore.

07:12.860 --> 07:16.050
Trixie, I could sleep in the funnel
of the Queen Mary right now.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.330
Milk Tray?

07:17.380 --> 07:20.130
They were a gift from the bunion
lady in Colette Street.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.900
I've eaten the Turkish Delight.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.810
I'll have the lime barrel
and the almond whirl.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.810
I'll ruin my lunch,
but I don't care.

07:29.860 --> 07:32.090
If I were you,
I'd eat the chocolates

07:32.140 --> 07:33.970
and just sneak 40 winks.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.370
Why?

07:35.420 --> 07:36.740
Chummy's bringing it.

07:39.100 --> 07:40.340
Oh.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.300
Bally, bally botheration.

07:46.380 --> 07:48.050
Something smells nice!

07:48.100 --> 07:49.890
It isn't for you! What was it?

07:49.940 --> 07:52.650
Individual chicken
and mushroom pies with flaky pastry.

07:52.700 --> 07:55.130
And don't even
ask about the coconut blancmange!

07:55.180 --> 07:57.250
Camilla. You try too hard.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.940
Look after the baby!

08:05.340 --> 08:07.850
There's a Tupperware full of stewed
pears if he's hungry,

08:07.900 --> 08:11.660
and if he starts turning his head
to the left, that means he's tired.

08:13.220 --> 08:14.260
Bye-bye, Mummy.

08:17.180 --> 08:18.980
Can I have some of the pears?

08:28.620 --> 08:31.050
I found the enema nozzles
and the rubber tubes.

08:31.100 --> 08:34.730
The labouring women
of Poplar will be thrilled.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.970
I can't believe how much space
we have!

08:37.020 --> 08:40.289
I feel like demanding roller-skates,
to get me from one cupboard
to another.

08:40.340 --> 08:42.610
No point in a clinical room
the size of County Hall,

08:42.659 --> 08:44.650
if the autoclave doesn't work.

08:44.700 --> 08:49.090
It's been on for ten minutes, and
it's about as hot as the North Pole!

08:49.140 --> 08:51.770
Sorry, Sister,
but we've lost a few spirit lamps.

08:51.820 --> 08:53.410
Put them in the dustbin.

08:53.460 --> 08:55.850
I shall have to go back to the
Post Office,

08:55.900 --> 08:58.820
to see why the telephone hasn't been
connected.

09:05.900 --> 09:08.970
Is everything all right,
Sister Monica Joan?

09:09.020 --> 09:11.290
I ventured through a door

09:11.340 --> 09:13.810
and uncovered something that
disturbed me.

09:13.860 --> 09:15.020
What, Sister?

09:17.900 --> 09:23.770
It disturbs you, too. I surmise
its purpose is a dark one.

09:23.820 --> 09:28.330
It is a urinal. You must try not
to let it upset you.

09:28.380 --> 09:31.410
The building used to be a training
school for parish workers but Fred's

09:31.460 --> 09:34.330
going to strip all that out, so
that we can use it as a store room.

09:34.380 --> 09:37.860
I think it is the source of the
vapours I detected.

09:41.100 --> 09:45.090
Come to the cookhouse door, ladies.
Luncheon is served.

09:45.140 --> 09:47.890
Home-cooked food!
What could be better?

09:55.660 --> 09:57.170
My dear Sister Winifred!

09:57.220 --> 09:59.690
I am so glad you have come to us!

09:59.740 --> 10:02.500
You cannot begin to imagine how
welcome you are.

10:04.660 --> 10:07.610
Now, not too heavy with the tomato
sauce. It's very expensive.

10:07.660 --> 10:09.130
Everyone!

10:09.180 --> 10:12.210
This is Sister Winifred, who has
come to live and work with us.

10:12.260 --> 10:15.530
Hello, Sister Winifred.
Hello! I'm delighted to be here.

10:15.580 --> 10:19.210
She joins Nonnatus
from the Mother House at Chichester.

10:19.260 --> 10:21.530
What a perfectly frightful journey.

10:21.580 --> 10:25.490
This is Nurse Franklin,
Nurse Miller, and Mrs Noakes,

10:25.540 --> 10:28.850
who used to nurse with us but has
moved on to the calling of marriage.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.090
Oh, that's nice.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.650
And this is Sister Monica Joan.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.690
Now, come and sit
next to Sister Evangelina.

10:35.740 --> 10:36.780
Hello.

10:38.300 --> 10:39.370
We've met.

10:39.420 --> 10:43.130
It was on my summer holidays.
They had nits in the village school.

10:43.180 --> 10:44.330
That was a very trying week.

10:44.380 --> 10:46.210
Were you a head inspector, Sister?

10:46.260 --> 10:48.450
Head inspector. Nit nurse.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.730
The children used to call me
Nitty Nora the Scalp Explorer,

10:51.780 --> 10:55.980
but I suppose that's just
because there's not many things that
rhyme with Winifred.

10:57.900 --> 11:00.610
Now, haddock, plaice, or saveloy?

11:00.660 --> 11:03.370
I'm frightfully sorry.
The saveloy was not intentional.

11:03.420 --> 11:04.730
I'll have...

11:04.780 --> 11:07.290
whatever no-one else wants.

11:07.340 --> 11:08.820
Correct answer.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.660
Thank you.

11:17.020 --> 11:19.060
Enter.

11:20.780 --> 11:23.050
The patient files are completely
reorganised.

11:23.100 --> 11:25.450
It's time for the finishing touches.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.130
There was no sun in your old
surgery.

11:27.180 --> 11:29.730
Any plant would have withered
and died.

11:29.780 --> 11:32.930
You know, there is a permanent
position for you, if you'd like it.

11:32.980 --> 11:36.010
Receptionist
and all-round saviour of my sanity.

11:36.060 --> 11:38.930
Timmy needs me at home
and so do you.

11:38.980 --> 11:42.140
I love helping out,
but it's part-time, and temporary.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.290
What on earth is that
supposed to say?

11:45.340 --> 11:47.210
"Erythromycin suspension".

11:47.260 --> 11:49.570
I'm going to set you
handwriting exercises.

12:08.940 --> 12:10.060
Whoops! Timber...

12:11.980 --> 12:13.380
You'll get the hang of it.

12:21.340 --> 12:24.020
What's she doing?
I have absolutely no idea.

12:25.300 --> 12:26.540
Ah.

12:34.140 --> 12:37.450
Oh, I'm glad to see you
expanding your skills,

12:37.500 --> 12:39.330
for I require book shelves.

12:39.380 --> 12:41.650
They need to be erected in my room.

12:41.700 --> 12:43.810
Where did you get that wood?

12:43.860 --> 12:46.690
They're revising their display
arrangements at the pet shop.

12:46.740 --> 12:48.970
Sister,
you might have injured yourself!

12:49.020 --> 12:52.010
My books have been in boxes
for far too long.

12:52.060 --> 12:55.170
If they are not set straight,
their contents will jumble,

12:55.220 --> 12:56.660
and become deranged.

13:00.860 --> 13:02.620
Hi, Nurse Lee! Hello!

13:06.460 --> 13:08.490
Well done! Goodness!

13:08.540 --> 13:12.530
I certainly feel as though I've
earned my spurs!

13:12.580 --> 13:16.570
We've only cycled half a mile.
And that was just the warm-up.

13:16.620 --> 13:21.410
We'll call in on Joan Rickart first.
She lives at number nine.

13:21.460 --> 13:22.690
What's that smell?

13:22.740 --> 13:25.090
It's the communal lavatory.

13:25.140 --> 13:27.970
Is it broken?
No, it's just busy.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.180
Wait a moment!

13:38.220 --> 13:39.820
Hello, little boy.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.500
You shouldn't be out here.
Where's your mummy?

13:48.820 --> 13:51.010
I know this family.

13:51.060 --> 13:53.330
I saw the mother just this morning.

13:53.380 --> 13:56.100
Come on, let's get you inside.

13:57.420 --> 13:58.540
Yes.

14:05.060 --> 14:08.690
I can't keep on top of things!
I can't!

14:08.740 --> 14:10.690
I'm never done boiling water
for the washing.

14:10.740 --> 14:13.450
I'm spending half my family
allowance on Stergene.

14:13.500 --> 14:17.330
My hands are splitting open
from forever wringing nappies.

14:20.140 --> 14:22.530
Is he all right?

14:22.580 --> 14:25.210
Well, he's on the dainty side.

14:25.260 --> 14:27.380
Maybe more of a jockey than
a docker!

14:28.380 --> 14:30.690
Are you still giving him the breast?

14:30.740 --> 14:33.420
Yeah, but I top him up with a bottle
cos he's always hungry!

14:34.860 --> 14:38.010
Sorry.
I know that's not really allowed.

14:38.060 --> 14:41.020
I've never met a baby yet
who's read the rule book.

14:42.580 --> 14:44.610
I'll add you to our daily list,
Merle.

14:44.660 --> 14:48.420
We'll call in each morning, and help
you get things on an even keel.

14:51.660 --> 14:54.210
I've just looked up
Martin's birth weight.

14:54.260 --> 14:56.850
He's four weeks old.
He's only gained half a pound.

14:56.900 --> 15:01.650
Topping up, indeed! Breast is best,
every four hours and no arguments.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.050
But the mothers won't listen.

15:03.100 --> 15:05.210
Afternoon, ladies. Settling in?

15:05.260 --> 15:06.970
It's already starting to
feel like home.

15:07.020 --> 15:10.490
Except the phone doesn't work,
so people keep dropping in to
visit unannounced.

15:10.540 --> 15:14.250
Well, phones or no phones,
I wanted to tell you face to face.

15:14.300 --> 15:17.610
We have found a permanent site
for your ante-natal clinic.

15:17.660 --> 15:20.930
At last! At the Council Community
Centre, in Argent Street.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.170
Now the best news of all is

15:22.220 --> 15:24.210
we can have it for two afternoons
a week, not one.

15:24.260 --> 15:27.050
Can clinic still be on a Tuesday?
That's what I want to know.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.370
It's always been on a Tuesday

15:28.420 --> 15:30.890
and I don't want the mothers
messed about any further.

15:30.940 --> 15:35.730
Tuesday - absolutely. And Thursdays,
too - without extra charge.

15:35.780 --> 15:38.370
Oh, this is the best chance
we've ever had of delivering

15:38.420 --> 15:41.010
not just health care,
but health education.

15:41.060 --> 15:43.570
Well, we could give classes
in mothercraft, nutrition,

15:43.620 --> 15:45.090
cookery, exercise.

15:45.140 --> 15:46.610
The list is limitless!

15:46.660 --> 15:48.650
I bet it is.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.170
I actually think it might be
rather marvellous.

15:51.220 --> 15:53.970
Tuesdays are just a relentless
round of weighing, measuring,

15:54.020 --> 15:55.410
and boiling urine.

15:55.460 --> 15:57.730
We never have any time
for teaching other skills.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.930
We need to give classes
in nutrition, for a start.

15:59.980 --> 16:01.930
People think orange jelly's
full of vitamins.

16:01.980 --> 16:05.890
Yes, and don't you think it might be
fun to do things like music
and movement with the toddlers?

16:05.940 --> 16:07.050
Fun?

16:07.100 --> 16:10.530
We're givers of health care.
Not children's entertainers!

16:10.580 --> 16:14.170
Sister Monica Joan, why don't you
sit down and eat with us?

16:14.220 --> 16:17.330
I have not time to while away
an hour in idleness!

16:17.380 --> 16:19.450
I am making
an inventory of my books.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.490
Very strenuous, I'm sure.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.260
Why don't you take the whole plate?
Keep your strength up.

16:31.620 --> 16:33.810
There's some nice
Red Leicester in your sandwich,

16:33.860 --> 16:36.370
and I've popped in a couple
of radishes.

16:36.420 --> 16:39.410
You haven't cut them
into novelty shapes again, have you?

16:39.460 --> 16:41.570
Only I got joshed
by the others last time.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.890
Well, the least one can do is try
and raise a smile!

16:43.940 --> 16:45.530
Midnight lunch is a dismal affair.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.540
I remember it well from
when I was on night shifts.

16:51.900 --> 16:52.940
Thermos.

16:58.380 --> 16:59.700
You take care tonight.

17:03.940 --> 17:06.010
I've got quite enough to keep me
out of mischief.

17:06.060 --> 17:08.380
I'm on the final furlong with
those scatter cushions.

Hello, Nonnatus House.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.130
I never thought I'd be so thrilled
to hear the telephone ring.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.450
Hel...

18:41.780 --> 18:43.330
Just about to go on my rounds.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.610
But I had to test the Nonnatus
phone. The wretched thing still
isn't working!

18:46.660 --> 18:49.210
Do you want to hear
something that will cheer you up?

18:49.260 --> 18:51.090
Yes, if you tell me quickly.

18:51.140 --> 18:55.210
We've been courting for precisely
six months today.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.810
I feel rather inclined to tie a
bunch of balloons to this phone box.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.650
I'm on duty, Alec.

19:01.700 --> 19:04.500
Say that again,
but a bit more primly.

19:22.540 --> 19:23.580
What do you think?

19:25.940 --> 19:26.980
It'll do!

19:33.740 --> 19:36.490
Something isn't right, Nurse.
One minute, he's running around,

19:36.540 --> 19:39.730
full of beans, the next, he's
coughing till he nearly chokes.

19:39.780 --> 19:44.170
He doesn't seem feverish,
but we need to rule out infection.

19:44.220 --> 19:46.610
I want the doctor to see both boys,

19:46.660 --> 19:49.570
and, as you've been bottle feeding,
I'd also like to check

19:49.620 --> 19:52.050
that everything's been properly
sterilised.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.650
Are you saying
I can't clean things properly?

19:54.700 --> 19:57.090
I'm never done boiling,
and soaking stuff in Milton!

19:57.140 --> 19:58.770
I don't doubt that for a moment.

19:58.820 --> 20:01.570
But, Merle, when you've no choice
but to wash bottles and nappies

20:01.620 --> 20:05.010
in the same sink, there's always
a chance contamination may occur.

20:05.060 --> 20:07.610
They're never well! Neither of them.

20:07.660 --> 20:11.410
Ian's always had a chest, and I used
to think, he's just a winter baby.

20:11.460 --> 20:14.530
But Martin came in the spring
and if anything, he's worse.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.850
His nappies are a nightmare.

20:16.900 --> 20:19.690
There's so many,
even Billy has to help.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.810
I daren't tell them down the
dockyard.

20:21.860 --> 20:24.180
Ssh...

20:27.820 --> 20:30.090
Nurse! Billy?

20:30.140 --> 20:31.450
When will the doctor come?

20:31.500 --> 20:34.250
Would it be quicker
if I took the nipper to the surgery?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.490
I'll ask Doctor to put
you on his rounds tomorrow.

20:36.540 --> 20:38.690
It isn't an emergency.
Just a puzzle.

20:38.740 --> 20:42.370
I...I had a brother pass away,
when I was little.

20:42.420 --> 20:45.450
He was four. And a quarter.

20:45.500 --> 20:49.090
My mum never likes it
if we leave the quarter off.

20:49.140 --> 20:50.010
I'm sorry.

20:50.060 --> 20:55.610
I sometimes reckon, if he had lived
now, he wouldn't have died.

20:55.660 --> 20:57.900
Times change for the better,
don't they?

20:59.220 --> 21:01.340
Yes. They do.

21:16.260 --> 21:17.890
No sign of the GPO engineers?

21:17.940 --> 21:20.330
I keep pacing up
and down by the telephone in case

21:20.380 --> 21:22.530
they might ring to say
they are on their way.

21:22.580 --> 21:24.610
Which of course they won't.
Because they can't.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.210
And of course if they could, and
they did, they wouldn't actually
need to.

21:28.260 --> 21:31.820
A statement almost
Aristotelian in its logic.

21:54.020 --> 21:58.650
Shelagh, are these really
the only ladies left? Yes.

21:58.700 --> 22:00.610
There are 21 women who
haven't appeared,

22:00.660 --> 22:03.210
and nine of those have previous
missed appointments.

22:03.260 --> 22:07.450
My word, it's all rather palatial
compared to the old Parish Hall.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.970
Am I too late to pick up some
vitamin drops for young sir?

22:10.020 --> 22:12.610
No, you can have vitamin drops,
a full weigh and measure,

22:12.660 --> 22:15.610
an assessment for milk tokens
and an eye test, if you like.

22:15.660 --> 22:18.930
There's no queue, and you're
guaranteed personal attention.

22:18.980 --> 22:20.890
I really am a tail-end Charlie,
aren't I?

22:20.940 --> 22:23.610
I was at church, sorting out some
mildew on the kneelers.

22:23.660 --> 22:25.210
Hardly anybody came, Chummy.

22:25.260 --> 22:27.970
The trouble is,
I'm not sure people know where the

22:28.020 --> 22:30.730
Community Centre is,
or what it's for.

22:30.780 --> 22:33.570
People are used to Parish Halls,
and Missions.

22:33.620 --> 22:36.370
If something doesn't have a saint's
name in front of it, I think

22:36.420 --> 22:37.810
they're a little suspicious.

22:37.860 --> 22:39.490
But at least you're of fixed
abode now.

22:39.540 --> 22:41.410
Time for a leafleting campaign,
methinks!

22:41.460 --> 22:43.970
Chummy, I wish we had the time!

22:44.020 --> 22:46.610
Well, If you haven't, I have.

22:46.660 --> 22:48.850
Oceans of it. Acres.

22:48.900 --> 22:51.700
I'm knee deep in time.
You can have it all.

22:54.980 --> 22:57.010
Sister?

22:57.060 --> 22:59.730
I wondered if I might talk
to you about Sister Monica Joan.

22:59.780 --> 23:02.650
If she approaches you with
cake in your first week,

23:02.700 --> 23:04.250
pick up your skirts and run.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.340
It's all a ruse,
designed to embarrass the unwary.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.500
It's nothing to do with cake,
Sister.

23:21.180 --> 23:23.690
She may be my sister in Christ,

23:23.740 --> 23:28.500
but I swear she would drive
a Methodist to drink!

23:31.820 --> 23:36.410
I am placing the biography of Astley
Cooper, master surgeon,

23:36.460 --> 23:39.970
next to the memoirs of Rousseau,

23:40.020 --> 23:44.130
since I deem it likely they
conversed in life.

23:44.180 --> 23:49.370
The Dewey Decimal system is
altogether too earthbound,

23:49.420 --> 23:52.850
and likely to speak loudest
to pedantic minds.

23:52.900 --> 23:57.770
You have been cutting pages
out of Bibles.

23:57.820 --> 24:01.250
I have excised certain chapters
of the Apocrypha.

24:01.300 --> 24:05.860
The act cannot be heretical -
the Apocrypha is heretical itself.

24:09.020 --> 24:12.530
Urine sample. Now, please.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.810
In case you've forgotten where the
bathroom is,

24:14.860 --> 24:16.130
it's just across the way.

24:16.180 --> 24:20.570
You think my mind is fractured,
and the cause lies in my bladder.

24:20.620 --> 24:24.930
You are no better than Plato,
who believed a woman's womb would

24:24.980 --> 24:28.530
roam her body,
provoking psychological disease.

24:28.580 --> 24:32.010
I have put Plato here,
next to Mr Freud,

24:32.060 --> 24:34.530
so they can be companions
in their ignorance.

24:34.580 --> 24:38.930
Sister. You've been martyr
to your waterworks all winter.

24:38.980 --> 24:40.570
And you know, as well as I do,
that

24:40.620 --> 24:43.410
the slightest infection can bring
you right down.

24:43.460 --> 24:46.860
But I am not brought down now.
I am well!

24:48.340 --> 24:51.940
And filled...with purpose.

24:56.180 --> 24:57.380
I can see that.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.890
I've never been a reader,

25:03.940 --> 25:05.540
I've always been a doer.

25:07.860 --> 25:10.930
Books passed me by when I was young.

25:10.980 --> 25:14.290
Books have been my friends.

25:14.340 --> 25:17.140
I do not intend to forget what
they have taught me.

25:18.780 --> 25:23.940
Sister, I cannot deny that my memory
is sometimes in need of...

25:26.980 --> 25:28.220
..refreshment.

25:29.740 --> 25:33.890
But once a thing is known,

25:33.940 --> 25:36.500
it can never be unknown.

25:38.700 --> 25:40.020
Can it?

25:41.940 --> 25:42.980
No, Sister.

25:48.140 --> 25:50.540
And you be careful
with this edifice.

25:53.060 --> 25:55.180
We don't want it
falling on your foot.

26:08.020 --> 26:09.020
Come on, girls.

26:12.820 --> 26:15.820
Three chest infections
in six months is too many.

26:18.100 --> 26:19.730
It's been more than that.

26:19.780 --> 26:22.970
But sometimes not so bad we feel
we ought not to bother you.

26:23.020 --> 26:24.180
Always bother me.

26:25.660 --> 26:28.090
I'm going to give Ian penicillin,

26:28.140 --> 26:30.890
and call in again
in three days' time.

26:30.940 --> 26:35.010
Nurse, I want some stool samples
from Martin, as soon as

26:35.060 --> 26:40.610
he wakes up. Then he is to have
formula milk only, on prescription.

26:40.660 --> 26:43.010
He's to be weighed daily.

26:43.060 --> 26:44.730
Will that tell us what's wrong?

26:44.780 --> 26:46.820
It may tell us nothing is wrong.

26:49.220 --> 26:52.450
If this is nothing,
then I'm just a lousy mother!

26:52.500 --> 26:53.970
It means I can't feed him!

26:54.020 --> 26:55.770
It means I can't keep him clean!

26:55.820 --> 26:58.130
It means I'll never go an hour
without him screaming!

26:58.180 --> 27:00.810
Merle, no-one is criticising you.

27:00.860 --> 27:04.490
But we need to see if Martin's
actually getting enough food.

27:04.540 --> 27:06.410
That way we can
tackle his upset tummy,

27:06.460 --> 27:08.500
and try and help him put on weight.

27:09.500 --> 27:11.380
You believe he's ill, don't you?

27:15.100 --> 27:17.580
I believe we'll find out one
way or another.

27:20.820 --> 27:23.970
It's a wonderfully enterprising
idea, Mrs Noakes.

27:24.020 --> 27:26.330
But it will be quite
a challenge to organise.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.690
Well, all you have to do is run
the clinic as normal,

27:28.740 --> 27:31.170
and then the displays by the Cubs,
the Sewing Club,

27:31.220 --> 27:33.770
the flower arrangers, and
the Girls' Brigade

27:33.820 --> 27:36.610
will take place around you
as the afternoon goes on.

27:36.660 --> 27:39.810
Just reading this leaflet is
an education.

27:39.860 --> 27:43.490
I wasn't aware that half these
societies existed.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.300
Well, some of them are quite new.

27:47.740 --> 27:49.260
I've only just set them up.

27:50.940 --> 27:53.650
May I keep this?
Actually, it's the only copy.

27:53.700 --> 27:56.860
I was just on my way to the library,
to get it copied on the Roneo.

28:00.060 --> 28:02.180
I think interest may be rather
brisk.

28:04.660 --> 28:07.220
Hello! Would you like one?
Thank you.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.850
Good afternoon.

28:14.900 --> 28:17.060
Can I give you one of these?
Ah, thanks.

28:20.420 --> 28:22.450
Gosh! Looks like hard work.

28:22.500 --> 28:23.810
Can I give you one of these?

28:23.860 --> 28:25.500
No, thanks, dear.

28:34.020 --> 28:37.850
Ah, now, Mrs Torpy,
this should interest you.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.650
Particularly as a newcomer
to Poplar.

28:39.700 --> 28:42.650
There are all sorts of clubs
and classes for you...

28:42.700 --> 28:44.610
Well, and indeed for Sheryl.

28:44.660 --> 28:48.410
You might like Girls' Brigade. It's
a uniformed Christian organisation.

28:48.460 --> 28:50.850
Better than putting that muck
all over her face.

28:50.900 --> 28:52.900
I'm practising for when I get a job.

28:54.460 --> 28:56.940
A job down Cable Street,
looking like that.

28:58.140 --> 28:59.690
And most importantly,

28:59.740 --> 29:02.290
the ante-natal clinic would be
right up your street.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.210
You can have all your routine
tests there,

29:04.260 --> 29:06.290
and a reassuring chat with
a midwife every week.

29:06.340 --> 29:09.570
God love you, but er, this is
my fourth, so when the time comes,

29:09.620 --> 29:12.250
I'm just going to
ring for the ambulance.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.130
Do yous do bingo?

29:14.180 --> 29:15.330
Oh, bingo?

29:15.380 --> 29:16.690
Well, never say never.

29:16.740 --> 29:19.850
Well, if yous do bingo,

29:19.900 --> 29:21.300
I'll be there every day.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.490
Nobody's interested.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.890
And I had visions of mounted
policemen

29:31.940 --> 29:34.810
trying to control
the surging crowds.

29:34.860 --> 29:36.940
Mounted policemen are already
booked.

29:38.140 --> 29:40.050
I had to stay late for a briefing.

29:40.100 --> 29:43.050
The Docks and Harbour Offices
are getting a royal visit.

29:43.100 --> 29:45.970
Oh, but that's absolutely thrilling!

29:46.020 --> 29:47.170
Is it the Queen?

29:47.220 --> 29:49.610
No. The next best thing, though.

29:49.660 --> 29:52.370
Her Royal Highness,
the Princess Margaret.

29:52.420 --> 29:55.290
Oh, but I haven't seen her
since Pa was knighted.

29:55.340 --> 29:58.610
Oh, we absolutely must join
the throng, to cheer her on.

29:58.660 --> 30:00.250
It'll be quite a small throng.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.730
It's just a trade
and industry engagement.

30:02.780 --> 30:04.890
But that will bore her to tears!

30:04.940 --> 30:06.930
And people would want to see her.

30:06.980 --> 30:11.370
Princess Margaret is like royalty
and a film star rolled into one!

30:11.420 --> 30:12.660
I suppose.

30:13.660 --> 30:17.420
The docks and harbour
visit was her only invitation.

30:19.140 --> 30:21.100
I find that hard to credit.

30:23.060 --> 30:24.180
When's she coming?

30:25.420 --> 30:26.580
Week on Tuesday.

30:28.780 --> 30:30.650
Oh, do you know?

30:30.700 --> 30:32.620
That's really quite fortuitous.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.490
It's been a week
since Ian started penicillin.

31:27.540 --> 31:30.540
But his phlegm's so thick
he can't seem to cough it up.

31:33.340 --> 31:36.060
He needs to be in hospital.
They both do.

31:38.300 --> 31:40.930
They need proper looking after
and I can't do it.

31:40.980 --> 31:43.330
I'll speak to Doctor,

31:43.380 --> 31:45.090
but you must trust him.

31:45.140 --> 31:47.890
He deals with this
sort of thing every day.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.530
Begging your pardon, Nurse.

31:51.420 --> 31:52.580
So do we.

31:57.220 --> 32:00.290
Every test I've run has
come back clear.

32:00.340 --> 32:01.970
I'll refer both Ian and Martin

32:02.020 --> 32:05.370
to the paediatric specialist
at the London, but...

32:05.420 --> 32:07.450
What do you think's the matter,
Doctor?

32:07.500 --> 32:08.780
I wish I knew.

32:10.860 --> 32:13.260
How do you find Mrs Vickers'
state of mind?

32:15.820 --> 32:21.580
Er, she's weepy, exhausted,
scarcely leaves the flat.

32:23.260 --> 32:27.010
I've noticed she's started to let
her appearance go.

32:27.060 --> 32:30.930
Women can develop depression up to
a year after the birth of a child.

32:30.980 --> 32:34.340
May explain why she's
struggling to cope.

32:36.700 --> 32:39.010
There is one other thing.

32:39.060 --> 32:40.690
Billy - the children's father -

32:40.740 --> 32:43.330
had a brother who
died at the age of four.

32:43.380 --> 32:45.730
Some sort of chest complaint.

32:45.780 --> 32:48.530
Do you think that might be
making them even more anxious?

32:48.580 --> 32:50.690
Yes, I do! Absolutely, I do.

32:50.740 --> 32:53.330
But that doesn't mean those
children aren't unwell.

32:53.380 --> 32:55.100
No. I know that.

33:05.020 --> 33:06.850
Oh, look at that.

33:06.900 --> 33:10.900
It's the thickest and smoothest
writing paper I've ever seen.

33:12.100 --> 33:15.330
It's always like that.
Even when it's only
the lady-in-waiting who writes.

33:15.380 --> 33:18.490
But Chummy, they said yes!
I think it's tremendous!

33:18.540 --> 33:21.770
Ssh! You know perfectly well you're
not supposed to be here!

33:21.820 --> 33:23.570
Yes, and if the nuns wake up
and come down,

33:23.620 --> 33:25.170
we'll have to lock
you in the larder.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.130
And you'll never
get your fried egg sandwich.

33:27.180 --> 33:29.530
We only let you in
because you bring your own Tabasco.

33:29.580 --> 33:31.010
Come and sit down, Chummy.

33:31.060 --> 33:32.810
I've got to get back to the baby.

33:32.860 --> 33:34.370
Peter starts his night shift soon.

33:34.420 --> 33:37.260
Oh, just for five minutes.
You look exhausted.

33:41.580 --> 33:45.130
I've had wings on my heels all day,
and now I'm coming down to earth.

33:45.180 --> 33:47.290
I've had to go to the police,
the council,

33:47.340 --> 33:50.250
ring the lady-in-waiting three
times, and write a letter to Sister

33:50.300 --> 33:53.610
Julienne... Ooh, which I need you to
put on her desk in the morning.

33:53.660 --> 33:56.690
Gosh! What else have you had to do?

33:56.740 --> 33:59.770
Amongst other things, nobble some
needlewomen for my Sewing Club,

33:59.820 --> 34:01.570
and buy a book on flower arranging,

34:01.620 --> 34:03.610
so I could teach
a flower arranging class.

34:03.660 --> 34:05.930
I told the lady-in-waiting
that both exist already.

34:05.980 --> 34:08.170
Well, I can teach flower arranging.

34:08.219 --> 34:10.889
My godmother bought me lessons,
from Constance Spry.

34:10.940 --> 34:14.290
What about the Cubs? They aren't
a figment of your imagination.

34:14.340 --> 34:17.489
They're going to celebrate the
maritime connections to the East End

34:17.540 --> 34:19.570
by re-enacting the story
of Grace Darling.

34:19.620 --> 34:22.010
Jack Smith's going to play
the lighthouse.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.530
Well, I think that sounds
absolutely lovely.

34:24.580 --> 34:26.449
As will the Girls' Brigade band,

34:26.500 --> 34:28.610
as they play
a fanfare for the Princess!

34:28.659 --> 34:33.370
But Chummy, the Girls' Brigade band
is terrible! I should know.
I have to listen to them every week.

34:33.420 --> 34:37.010
But I've promised
the lady-in-waiting. Mea culpa.

34:37.060 --> 34:39.850
Well, I played
the bugle in the RAF cadets.

34:39.900 --> 34:42.610
I could come and knock them into
shape. Would you really?

34:42.659 --> 34:45.500
Give anything for a close-up
view of Princess Margaret.

36:01.020 --> 36:02.340
You've done enough.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.700
I hope so.

36:22.740 --> 36:26.250
Baby Martin has desperate
trouble with digestion.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.570
Ian has a cough,
and terrible diarrhoea.

36:28.620 --> 36:30.490
They're both worryingly small.

36:30.540 --> 36:32.810
It was the first thing I noticed
when I saw them.

36:32.860 --> 36:35.450
I'm very much afraid it sounds like
"failure to thrive".

36:35.500 --> 36:38.250
Failure to thrive isn't a diagnosis,
Sister!

36:38.300 --> 36:40.450
They've used that term
since Victorian times.

36:40.500 --> 36:42.610
Has an infection been ruled out?

36:42.660 --> 36:45.930
Stool samples were tested, and swabs
taken, but they came back clear.

36:45.980 --> 36:47.970
Dr Turner's tried everything.

36:48.020 --> 36:51.050
It is the way their humours
are aligned!

36:51.100 --> 36:55.610
I have a volume detailing just
the illness you describe.

36:55.660 --> 36:58.970
It dates from
when Queen Anne was on the throne.

36:59.020 --> 37:00.290
Really, Sister?

37:00.340 --> 37:05.650
Yes, it says children such as these
will not survive five years.

37:05.700 --> 37:09.580
And when their brow is kissed,
they taste of salt.

37:12.900 --> 37:15.370
It is upstairs,
wrapped in chamois leather,

37:15.420 --> 37:18.770
for its vibrations must be
shielded from refracted light.

37:18.820 --> 37:21.660
We must tidy away.
It is time for high tea.

37:22.820 --> 37:26.540
You say that as though high tea
will entice me to silence!

37:31.780 --> 37:36.170
I have a repository of knowledge
to maintain.

37:36.220 --> 37:39.220
You may leave a plate
of Marie biscuits by my door.

38:13.820 --> 38:14.860
How are they?

38:18.300 --> 38:19.500
Asleep.

38:23.820 --> 38:25.540
I almost wish they'd wake,

38:28.700 --> 38:29.860
cos when they sleep,

38:31.380 --> 38:32.620
I think.

38:35.340 --> 38:37.530
And when I think,

38:37.580 --> 38:40.770
I worry
that I'm not in my right mind.

38:40.820 --> 38:42.490
Sssh.

38:42.540 --> 38:46.370
They take people away when they're
not in their right mind.

38:46.420 --> 38:48.180
And what would happen then?

38:56.020 --> 38:58.300
It's time for compline.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.260
Sister Monica Joan?

39:31.740 --> 39:34.010
What's that you're sewing?

39:34.060 --> 39:36.450
It's a baby's nightdress.

39:36.500 --> 39:37.540
Do you mean...?

39:39.980 --> 39:41.060
I've no news yet.

39:42.220 --> 39:43.540
But I've so much hope!

39:44.980 --> 39:48.050
Every night, I put
a handful of stitches into this,

39:48.100 --> 39:51.180
tiny cross-stitches, like kisses.

39:52.940 --> 39:55.170
I suppose it's a prayer.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.100
A little present for the future.

40:04.220 --> 40:06.570
Sister Monica Joan,
come in out of the rain.

40:06.620 --> 40:08.060
I have no need of shelter.

40:09.620 --> 40:12.970
But you, you, Dr Turner,
if you wish to solve a mystery,

40:13.020 --> 40:14.570
you must read this book.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.860
I will. When I've taken you home.

40:26.380 --> 40:30.050
Sister Monica Joan, where have you
been? You weren't at Compline.

40:30.100 --> 40:33.290
She needs a warm drink, and tuck her
up with a hot water bottle.

40:33.340 --> 40:40.650
Hark, Sister! He is a physician,
and a man, and expects to be
listened to.

40:40.700 --> 40:44.660
If only he had ears
for the words of others.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.020
Or eyes to read their books.

41:01.820 --> 41:03.330
Peter.

41:03.380 --> 41:04.620
It's today.

41:07.940 --> 41:10.730
You're going to have to put
those books away

41:10.780 --> 41:13.100
and get your jacket on,
or we'll be late.

41:16.900 --> 41:19.170
One of these is shinier
than the other.

41:19.220 --> 41:21.610
Did you get distracted
halfway through?

41:21.660 --> 41:23.340
Yes, I did.

41:30.140 --> 41:31.900
Oh, good Lord.

41:33.020 --> 41:35.130
It's a good job I'm
out of your vision, young Sir,

41:35.180 --> 41:40.620
because I'm sorry to say,
I look exactly like my mother.

41:42.860 --> 41:46.410
That's my girl.
Come out and see the princess.

41:46.460 --> 41:49.010
Fresh air will do us good.
Won't it?

41:55.380 --> 41:56.930
Billy!

41:56.980 --> 41:59.660
Something's happening.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.860
I'll call an ambulance.
There's no time.

42:27.220 --> 42:31.340
I'm worried we'll be late. The
mother whose baby I'm bathing is
going to meet me there at ten to.

42:32.620 --> 42:34.810
Sister Monica Joan won't come
out of her room.

42:34.860 --> 42:38.290
She can probably smell all that
lacquer on your hair.

42:38.340 --> 42:41.690
I'd watch yourself
when you light the spirit lamp.

42:41.740 --> 42:43.850
I feel sorry for Princess Margaret.

42:43.900 --> 42:46.980
Imagine having to look enthralled
by someone boiling urine.

42:56.580 --> 42:58.330
Help me.

42:58.380 --> 43:00.860
He's fitting!

43:03.900 --> 43:06.940
Thermometer and mucus extractor.
He can barely breathe.

43:09.180 --> 43:12.290
Mother started running here as soon
as the twitching started

43:12.340 --> 43:14.700
so that's just under four minutes.

43:34.140 --> 43:36.690
I've cleared his throat,
and he's stopped fitting.

43:36.740 --> 43:37.970
I brought the car.

43:38.020 --> 43:42.450
The road's been closed for the royal
visit. Might delay the ambulance.

43:42.500 --> 43:45.620
Temperature's 102, Doctor.
I think I have a diagnosis.

43:56.420 --> 43:57.780
Might I see the child?

43:59.620 --> 44:01.130
Yes.

44:01.180 --> 44:03.330
I will do nothing untoward.

44:03.380 --> 44:04.820
I know you won't.

44:21.540 --> 44:24.250
Salt, like the sea.

44:24.300 --> 44:28.330
There was no name for it, even then,
though they knew its meaning.

44:28.380 --> 44:32.770
There is a name for it now.
It's called cystic fibrosis.

44:32.820 --> 44:37.140
It's hereditary, which might explain
the death of Billy Vickers' brother.

44:38.180 --> 44:39.700
Can it be cured, Doctor?

44:40.860 --> 44:43.260
It can be treated.

44:48.940 --> 44:51.050
We don't want finger marks.

44:51.100 --> 44:52.940
Rogue sultana.

45:03.260 --> 45:05.330
All right, lads...

45:05.380 --> 45:07.410
It was a dark and stormy night.

45:07.460 --> 45:10.290
Ooooooh!

45:10.340 --> 45:13.050
And the waves were crashing
against the rocks!

45:13.100 --> 45:15.890
Crasssssssssh! Crassssssssssh!

45:15.940 --> 45:21.170
Inside the lighthouse,
Grace Darling turns to her father

45:21.220 --> 45:22.930
and she says...

45:22.980 --> 45:25.770
Oh Father, what terrible weather.

45:25.820 --> 45:27.940
Grace Darling is a girl!

45:29.100 --> 45:31.500
You're supposed to do it
in a girl's voice.

45:33.060 --> 45:35.570
Like this, "Oh Father,
what terrible weather!"

45:35.620 --> 45:37.170
We'll start again...

45:37.220 --> 45:38.810
Nurse Franklin should be doing this.

45:38.860 --> 45:41.210
Her Royal Highness will be
here in less than 15 minutes,

45:41.260 --> 45:44.420
and not one member of staff
from Nonnatus House is here.

45:45.860 --> 45:49.900
Well, I hope when they do come, one
of them's got Rennies in her bag.

45:54.420 --> 45:56.460
Band ready!

46:04.260 --> 46:05.980
Stop, girls.

47:02.340 --> 47:04.100
I'm sorry.

47:05.260 --> 47:07.260
What for?

47:10.780 --> 47:15.450
If it runs in families,
then I passed it on to 'em.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.620
And so did I. You heard
the doctors - it takes two.

47:23.060 --> 47:24.370
This....

47:24.420 --> 47:28.260
is what runs in families, Billy.
This.

47:29.500 --> 47:33.690
Everything else, all the things
that are wrong or missing,

47:33.740 --> 47:35.060
they're just...

47:36.300 --> 47:37.580
Enzymes.

47:38.740 --> 47:40.900
That's the word.

47:43.020 --> 47:45.380
And the doctors say
they can give them artificial ones.

47:46.700 --> 47:50.020
This, no-one can make.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.660
No-one can take away.

48:34.660 --> 48:36.860
I say, excuse me.
May I be of help?

48:38.020 --> 48:40.620
We rang for the ambulance,
and it hasn't come.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.170
Bleeding Princess Margaret.

48:43.220 --> 48:45.730
My husband probably built
that road she's blocking.

48:45.780 --> 48:49.770
I'm a nurse and a midwife.
I'm quite happy to sit with Mrs
Torpy until the ambulance arrives.

48:49.820 --> 48:53.020
No. There's kids all over the place.
I don't want the racket of them.

49:00.140 --> 49:02.610
There you are.

49:02.660 --> 49:04.970
I hope you're not attached
to this settee.

49:05.020 --> 49:06.570
My waters haven't gone yet.

49:06.620 --> 49:09.090
Well, what's a loose cover
when a baby's on its way?

49:09.140 --> 49:11.460
Chuck us a tea towel, or something.

49:12.940 --> 49:14.580
Here you are.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.450
That's it!

49:31.500 --> 49:32.780
That's it!

49:34.820 --> 49:37.620
You show that bally pain who's boss!

49:50.580 --> 49:52.610
Did I make a cow noise?

49:52.660 --> 49:55.260
If I did, it means I'm getting
to the sharp end.

49:57.060 --> 49:59.980
Mrs Torpy, I think
we should both remove our hats.

50:02.700 --> 50:05.490
Sheryl, I want you to run straight
to Nonnatus House. Tell them

50:05.540 --> 50:07.740
a midwife is required
at this address.

50:10.340 --> 50:11.970
"Please" would be nice.

50:15.020 --> 50:17.890
Bravo! Bravo!

50:17.940 --> 50:19.330
That's it!

50:19.380 --> 50:21.370
Full marks! I can see baby's head.

50:21.420 --> 50:22.530
Are you sure?

50:22.580 --> 50:26.620
It's the least mistakable sight in
the world. And the most miraculous.

50:28.580 --> 50:31.250
Now then, old thing.
Baby isn't quite with us yet.

50:31.300 --> 50:35.130
So with the next pain, we're going
to try and slow things down a bit.

50:35.180 --> 50:38.060
A little less Gay Gordons,
slightly more Valeta.

50:44.260 --> 50:46.780
Small pushes now. Small pushes!

50:56.060 --> 50:59.100
Righty-ho.
Baby's with us as far as his chin.

51:00.460 --> 51:02.850
Now I just want one more bally
enormous push

51:02.900 --> 51:04.580
and we'll all be done and dusted.

51:14.660 --> 51:18.820
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
Is it not out yet?

51:20.740 --> 51:22.940
I'm afraid not.

51:25.140 --> 51:28.210
Seems we've got a bit of a shrinking
violet on our hands.

51:28.260 --> 51:30.210
Good God, would you just tell it
to me straight?

51:30.260 --> 51:33.220
I can't help you if
I don't know what you're on about!

51:35.540 --> 51:38.570
It seems that baby's
shoulders are stuck.

51:38.620 --> 51:41.500
If we work together,
we can free them.

51:44.180 --> 51:48.050
Just, just tell me what to do.

51:48.100 --> 51:50.620
I want you on the floor,
on all fours.

51:52.300 --> 51:54.570
Yes?

51:54.620 --> 51:56.660
That's it.

51:58.620 --> 52:01.050
Jesus!

52:01.100 --> 52:04.540
Now when you push, I'm going to see
if I can help him on his way.

52:12.060 --> 52:13.650
Keep it coming, keep it coming,

52:13.700 --> 52:17.340
keep it coming, that's it!

52:20.980 --> 52:24.330
It's not bloody budging, is it?

52:24.380 --> 52:27.170
No.

52:27.220 --> 52:29.820
Can you get on to your left-hand
side?

52:35.580 --> 52:37.860
Slowly, that's it.

52:40.140 --> 52:44.450
Now, I need you to push absolutely
with all of your strength.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.690
With the next pain?

52:46.740 --> 52:48.260
No. I need you to push now.

53:11.580 --> 53:16.290
Come on, little soldier.
Come on.

53:16.340 --> 53:17.980
Play the game. Play the game.

53:51.620 --> 53:54.020
It's all over.

53:55.340 --> 53:57.970
And everything's just begun.

53:58.020 --> 53:59.420
Talk about a day's work.

54:01.420 --> 54:02.740
Yes.

54:07.540 --> 54:09.450
Midwife! Open up!>

54:09.500 --> 54:13.090
Chummy, are you all right?>

54:13.140 --> 54:14.620
Never better.

54:21.700 --> 54:25.450
You accomplished a very great deal
yesterday, Mrs Noakes.

54:25.500 --> 54:28.690
It certainly was a rather
unusual afternoon.

54:28.740 --> 54:31.140
It wasn't just the thrill
of a royal visit.

54:32.380 --> 54:36.090
You coped with an extremely
difficult delivery alone.

54:36.140 --> 54:38.170
You looked after Mrs Torpy
wonderfully.

54:38.220 --> 54:43.330
I'm so glad.
Because I believe midwifery matters.

54:43.380 --> 54:45.490
And caring for women matters.

54:45.540 --> 54:48.690
It just so happens they're the only
things I've ever been

54:48.740 --> 54:50.380
the smallest shred of use at.

54:52.340 --> 54:56.330
You're also a good wife,
and an excellent mother.

54:56.380 --> 54:57.660
Those are gifts too.

54:58.780 --> 54:59.820
And I'm grateful.

55:00.940 --> 55:04.290
I just worry that if Peter
and the baby are the only things

55:04.340 --> 55:07.170
I have to love,
I'll end up crushing them

55:07.220 --> 55:09.690
to death with
the weight of my devotion.

55:09.740 --> 55:12.290
I put novelty vegetables
in lunch boxes

55:12.340 --> 55:15.650
and sit up all night running up
soft furnishings.

55:15.700 --> 55:19.940
I do too much, and it's,
well, it's never enough.

55:22.740 --> 55:25.620
Do you want to come back to
Nonnatus House?

55:28.980 --> 55:30.930
Would you have me back, Sister?

55:30.980 --> 55:34.060
We're always short-staffed -
we're short of funds too.

55:35.300 --> 55:39.090
I could find a position for you two
days each week - if you could

55:39.140 --> 55:43.060
find suitable care for Freddie,
and if your husband were agreeable.

55:44.620 --> 55:48.130
Peter's always agreeable,
he's not like other men.

55:48.180 --> 55:51.090
But I suppose I'm not like other
women, really.

55:51.140 --> 55:54.540
No. You're a nurse, and a midwife.
