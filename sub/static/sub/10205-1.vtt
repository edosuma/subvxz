<i>All the time, everywhere...</i>

02:28.748 --> 02:31.752
<i>...everything's hearts
are beating and squirting...</i>

02:31.918 --> 02:35.422
<i>...and talking to each other
the ways I can't understand.</i>

02:37.223 --> 02:39.794
<i>Most of the time,
they probably be saying:</i>

02:39.959 --> 02:42.940
<i>"I'm hungry. I gotta poop."</i>

02:44.430 --> 02:47.001
<i>But sometimes
they be talking in codes.</i>

02:54.407 --> 02:56.045
Get out the way.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.452
Get your pants on, man.

03:33.379 --> 03:35.950
Feed up time! Feed up!

03:36.115 --> 03:37.458
Feed up time!

03:59.138 --> 04:01.209
Share with the dog.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.240
Ain't that ugly over there?

04:31.604 --> 04:34.346
We got the prettiest place on earth.

04:42.315 --> 04:44.659
<i>Daddy says, up above the levee...</i>

04:44.817 --> 04:47.991
<i>...on the dry side,
they're afraid of the water...</i>

04:48.154 --> 04:50.566
<i>...like a bunch of babies.</i>

04:51.524 --> 04:54.437
<i>They built the wall that cuts us off.</i>

05:01.434 --> 05:04.938
<i>They think we all gonna drown
down here.</i>

05:05.104 --> 05:07.141
<i>But we ain't going nowhere.</i>

05:13.613 --> 05:18.153
<i>The Bathtub has got more holidays
than the whole rest of the world.</i>

05:20.386 --> 05:21.888
Yeah!

05:22.055 --> 05:23.591
Yeah!

05:24.924 --> 05:26.528
Yeah!

05:38.538 --> 05:40.540
Yeah! Yeah!

05:46.245 --> 05:47.690
<i>Daddy always saying...</i>

05:47.847 --> 05:52.262
<i>...that up in the dry world,
they got none of what we got.</i>

05:58.791 --> 06:01.328
<i>They only got holidays once a year.</i>

06:01.494 --> 06:05.271
All babies in the race,
come up to the starting line.

06:10.303 --> 06:13.341
<i>They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers.</i>

06:14.907 --> 06:18.150
<i>They got their babies stuck in carriages.</i>

06:19.178 --> 06:22.625
<i>And chicken on sticks
and all that kind of stuff.</i>

06:35.928 --> 06:38.966
<i>One day, the storm is gonna blow...</i>

06:39.132 --> 06:43.808
<i>...the ground is gonna sink
and the water is gonna rise up so high...</i>

06:43.970 --> 06:48.544
<i>...there ain't gonna be no Bathtub.
Just a whole bunch of water.</i>

07:02.688 --> 07:04.190
Yeah!

07:33.152 --> 07:36.361
<i>But me and my daddy, we stay right here.</i>

07:36.522 --> 07:39.025
<i>Web who the earth is for.</i>

08:24.070 --> 08:29.110
Meat. Meat, meat, meat.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.457
Every animal is made out of meat.

08:33.613 --> 08:37.390
I'm meat. Y'all asses meat.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.962
Everything is part of the buffet
of the universe.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.032
This here is an aurochs...

08:49.195 --> 08:53.268
...a fierce, mean creature
that walked the face of the earth...

08:53.900 --> 08:56.471
...back when we all lived in the caves.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.446
And they would gobble them
cave-babies down...

08:59.605 --> 09:02.211
...right in front of the cave-baby parents.

09:02.375 --> 09:06.118
And the cavemans,
they couldn't even do nothing about it...

09:06.279 --> 09:09.089
...because they was too poor
and too small.

09:09.248 --> 09:11.489
Who up in here think
that the cavemans...

09:11.651 --> 09:14.655
...was sitting around crying
like a bunch of pussies?

09:16.789 --> 09:20.236
Y'all better think about that
because any day now...

09:20.393 --> 09:23.397
...fabric of the universe
is coming unraveled.

09:23.563 --> 09:26.806
Ice caps gonna melt,
water is gonna rise...

09:26.966 --> 09:30.539
...and everything south of the levee
is going under.

09:32.338 --> 09:35.342
Y'all better learn how to survive now.

09:43.649 --> 09:45.595
<i>Way back in the day...</i>

09:45.751 --> 09:48.357
<i>...the aurochs was king of the world.</i>

09:50.423 --> 09:55.532
<i>If it wasn't for giant snowballs
and the Iced Age...</i>

09:55.695 --> 09:57.606
<i>...I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy.</i>

09:57.763 --> 10:00.107
<i>I would just be breakfast.</i>

10:03.336 --> 10:04.576
Daddy?

10:06.439 --> 10:08.112
Feed up time.

10:26.592 --> 10:28.071
Feed up time.

10:45.578 --> 10:47.319
Daddy?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.150
Daddy!

11:15.941 --> 11:20.583
<i>Kids that got no mama,
no daddy and nobody...</i>

11:21.714 --> 11:24.126
<i>...they gots to live in the woods...</i>

11:24.283 --> 11:28.322
<i>...and eat grass and steal underpants.</i>

11:35.561 --> 11:37.336
<i>If Daddy don't get back soon...</i>

11:37.496 --> 11:40.670
<i>...it's gonna be time for me
to start eating my pets.</i>

11:42.401 --> 11:43.971
Daddy?

11:45.604 --> 11:47.140
Daddy?

11:51.577 --> 11:53.250
- That taste good?
- Yeah.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.899
Hey, my baby, you need a ride?

12:05.057 --> 12:07.469
No, my dad come and pick me up.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.970
Well, what about some food
or something, darling?

12:10.129 --> 12:11.699
You hungry?

12:14.433 --> 12:17.937
All right, then. Well, suit yourself, okay?

12:51.470 --> 12:56.146
<i>Everything we still got from Mama,
I keep in my house.</i>

12:59.979 --> 13:03.392
<i>Daddy says the first time
she looked at me...</i>

13:03.549 --> 13:05.893
<i>...it made her heart beat so big...</i>

13:06.051 --> 13:08.361
<i>...that she thought it would blow up.</i>

13:08.521 --> 13:10.865
<i>That's why she swam away.</i>

13:19.431 --> 13:21.741
<i>Hi, my sweet baby.</i>

13:23.335 --> 13:25.076
Hi, Mama.

13:35.314 --> 13:38.591
<i>Hushpuppy, what you doing there?</i>

13:51.397 --> 13:53.775
<i>You being good like I taught you?</i>

13:55.000 --> 13:56.707
Yes, Mama.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.600
<i>You're good</i>

14:24.763 --> 14:26.800
<i>You make me happy</i>

14:27.433 --> 14:29.743
<i>You're good</i>

14:29.902 --> 14:32.041
<i>You make me happy</i>

14:32.204 --> 14:34.411
<i>You're good</i>

14:34.573 --> 14:36.143
That's pretty, Ma.

14:36.308 --> 14:38.288
<i>You're pretty, Hushpuppy.</i>

14:41.814 --> 14:44.385
Get out of my way, you fat animal.

14:47.319 --> 14:48.855
Daddy.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.892
Daddy! Daddy!

14:55.628 --> 14:59.576
I learned lots of things
while you were gone.

15:00.966 --> 15:05.437
If I drink all this here,
I can burp like a man.

15:14.013 --> 15:17.927
- Why are you wearing that dress?
- Leave me alone, man.

15:25.024 --> 15:27.026
You wearing a bracelet too?

15:27.192 --> 15:29.672
Go to your house.
You wouldn't understand.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.836
- I want to come to your house.
- Get out of here!

15:37.002 --> 15:39.380
- I want to come...
- Go ahead!

15:56.689 --> 15:59.033
Get down from there. Get over here.

16:12.037 --> 16:14.313
Feed up time! Come on, man! Feed up!

17:10.362 --> 17:11.807
Boss lady!

17:12.798 --> 17:15.142
Hushpuppy, where you at?

17:17.169 --> 17:19.079
Where you at, boss lady?

17:20.739 --> 17:24.380
<i>If Daddy kill me,
I ain't gonna be forgotten.</i>

17:28.079 --> 17:32.290
<i>I'm recording my story
for the scientists in the future.</i>

17:33.252 --> 17:36.358
<i>In a million years,
when kids go to school...</i>

17:36.522 --> 17:39.002
<i>...they're gonna know, once,
there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

17:39.158 --> 17:41.934
<i>...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>

17:43.429 --> 17:45.238
Hushpuppy!

17:49.368 --> 17:51.211
Where you at, man?

17:51.603 --> 17:53.082
HUSHPUPPY!

17:55.240 --> 17:56.742
Boss lady, goddamn it!

18:01.880 --> 18:03.291
Come here!

18:04.450 --> 18:07.056
Don't you run away from me!

18:07.219 --> 18:09.221
I swear to God!

18:13.125 --> 18:15.298
Get your ass back here!

18:15.461 --> 18:17.270
I'm tearing off!

18:17.429 --> 18:19.136
I'm tearing off just like my mama!

18:19.298 --> 18:22.609
I'm gonna bust your ass! Come here!

18:22.768 --> 18:24.213
- Come here!
- No!

18:24.369 --> 18:26.280
See what happen.
See what happen to you.

18:26.438 --> 18:27.473
No!

18:36.515 --> 18:39.860
I got to worry about you all the damn time!
You killing me!

18:40.352 --> 18:42.059
You killing me!

18:42.921 --> 18:44.161
Get up and now come on!

18:46.992 --> 18:48.027
I hope you die.

18:48.961 --> 18:54.343
And after you die, I'll go to your grave
and eat birthday cake all by myself.

19:45.517 --> 19:48.396
Mama, I think I broke something.

19:58.597 --> 20:01.305
Get over here!
Come on, let's go! Come on!

20:01.767 --> 20:03.644
Miss Bathsheeba!

20:03.802 --> 20:05.713
My daddy fell down.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.655
Oh, God. Come on, baby.

20:21.753 --> 20:23.255
Be okay.

20:28.260 --> 20:31.935
Hushpuppy, take this medicine.
You run fast as you can. Go.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.807
<i>Daddy could've turned into a tree.</i>

21:07.966 --> 21:09.673
<i>Or a bug.</i>

21:10.535 --> 21:12.913
<i>There wasn't any way to know.</i>

21:31.790 --> 21:33.531
<i>The whole universe...</i>

21:33.692 --> 21:37.299
<i>...depends on everything
fitting together just right.</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:47.140
<i>If one piece busts,
even the smallest piece...</i>

21:47.306 --> 21:50.412
<i>...the entire universe will get busted.</i>

22:21.073 --> 22:23.679
The storm's coming! The storm's coming!

22:23.842 --> 22:26.083
The storm is coming!

22:26.244 --> 22:28.781
The storm is coming!

22:58.477 --> 23:01.788
Hey, Walter. What it is?
Afraid of a little water?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.894
I ain't messing with you, Wink.
I'm getting out of here.

23:05.050 --> 23:07.223
You can stay if you want, but I'm out.

23:08.520 --> 23:11.000
Hey, now. What's up?

23:11.156 --> 23:12.658
Look at these assholes...

23:12.824 --> 23:15.395
...running around all over the damn place.
<i>C'est la vie,</i> assholes.

23:15.560 --> 23:17.267
- Hey.
- Ho! There's my boy, Wink!

23:17.429 --> 23:19.670
- We gonna do this storm?
- Let me tell you.

23:19.831 --> 23:22.004
These assholes go up and down here
all day long.

23:22.167 --> 23:25.410
That's what I'm talking about. LITTLE
We ain't leaving. I'm behind you.

23:25.570 --> 23:28.744
- Man, I don't mind telling you, I am scared.
- Just leave.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.682
- This ain't no little one.
- Damn pussy.

23:30.842 --> 23:32.822
I'm leaving here
soon as I finish my beer.

23:32.978 --> 23:36.551
No, you're not. You're gonna stay here
with me. I'll see you tomorrow, Walrus.

23:36.715 --> 23:39.161
- Y'all want to die, okay, fine.
- Look at Winston.

23:39.317 --> 23:41.661
Winston, I know you with me, huh, man?

23:41.820 --> 23:44.460
What you gonna do about the storm,
man?

23:44.623 --> 23:47.832
- Hey, Hushpuppy.
- Hushpuppy?

23:47.993 --> 23:50.439
Get that girl a beer.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.371
Where you been?

23:54.466 --> 23:56.605
- What happened to you?
- Shut up.

23:57.302 --> 23:58.906
You don't talk.

24:08.580 --> 24:09.991
Come here!

24:10.148 --> 24:11.786
Come here, ugly!

24:22.861 --> 24:24.772
Just because you
burnt your house down...

24:24.930 --> 24:27.467
...don't mean you can walk
in here and take over.

24:27.632 --> 24:30.613
This side of the house
is still Wink's side.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.682
No toys, no girl stuff over here.

24:33.839 --> 24:36.649
And if I want to come over there
and smack you in the face...

24:36.808 --> 24:39.880
...that's against the rules,
so that's a plus for you.

24:40.045 --> 24:42.252
So come on down here
and get in the boat.

24:42.414 --> 24:44.553
Come on, get in the boat!

24:49.321 --> 24:50.891
Get in the boat.

24:52.424 --> 24:56.372
And if the water gets real high,
we're gonna float to this roof...

24:56.528 --> 25:00.271
...we're gonna bust through the ceiling
and we're gonna ride away, okay?

25:03.435 --> 25:08.043
Now I want you to put these on, okay?
Slide your arm through here.

25:08.206 --> 25:11.710
Don't you never, never take these off.

25:11.877 --> 25:15.256
I'm your daddy and you're
gonna do what I tell you to do...

25:15.413 --> 25:18.519
...because it's my job
to keep you from dying, okay?

25:18.683 --> 25:21.061
So sit back and listen to me.

25:21.219 --> 25:23.096
And close your eyes.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.201
Go to sleep.

25:29.961 --> 25:31.463
Go to sleep!

25:58.990 --> 26:01.197
Why you staring at me like that?

26:01.493 --> 26:05.031
How I'm supposed to sleep
with you staring at me like that?

26:05.196 --> 26:07.073
What, you scared?

26:07.232 --> 26:10.509
I'm gonna show you,
no storm can't beat no Doucet.

26:11.636 --> 26:14.708
We Doucets.
We not scared of no damn storm!

26:14.873 --> 26:18.821
I'm gonna show you.
I'm gonna take care of that storm.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.015
I'm coming to get you, storm!

26:31.590 --> 26:34.196
Look at me! Look at me, Hushpuppy!

26:34.359 --> 26:38.273
Look at me whip butt!
Come on, storm!

26:38.430 --> 26:39.568
Come on!

26:42.834 --> 26:44.609
I'm gonna get you!

26:44.769 --> 26:46.680
Come on, I'm right here!

26:46.838 --> 26:49.182
I'm right here! Yeah!

26:50.809 --> 26:52.618
Yeah! Yeah!

27:01.820 --> 27:03.390
Mama!

27:10.128 --> 27:11.505
Mama?

29:06.911 --> 29:09.983
<i>For the animals that didn't have a dad
to put them in a boat...</i>

29:10.148 --> 29:13.288
<i>...the end of the world already happened.</i>

29:23.394 --> 29:25.203
Winston!

29:26.231 --> 29:28.336
Yo, Winston!

29:38.877 --> 29:42.654
<i>They're all down below,
trying to breathe through water.</i>

30:09.541 --> 30:12.021
Yo, Edison, you in here?

30:35.133 --> 30:39.309
Someday, when I'm gone,
you gonna be the last man in the Bathtub.

30:39.470 --> 30:41.848
You're gonna have to learn
how to feed yourself.

30:42.006 --> 30:44.816
Now stick your hand in this water.

30:44.976 --> 30:46.751
Stick it in there.

30:51.716 --> 30:54.253
Okay, what you do is
you hold your hand steady...

30:54.419 --> 30:57.559
...and you just wait on your fish to come.

31:05.163 --> 31:08.042
You gotta ball your fist up, okay?
That's your punching hand.

31:08.199 --> 31:11.976
Ball your fist up, case you have
to whack him when he come out.

31:21.379 --> 31:23.052
All right, all right.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.921
Oh, got it, got it!

31:30.088 --> 31:32.728
Yeah! Oh, Lord!

31:32.891 --> 31:35.098
Look what we got!
Look what we got!

31:35.260 --> 31:37.797
Gotcha. We got it! Say, "I gotcha!"

31:37.962 --> 31:39.635
- I gotcha!
- Yeah!

31:40.632 --> 31:42.908
Hold him down.
You hold him down like this...

31:43.067 --> 31:45.104
...and you whack him good
with your fist.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.978
Go ahead, whack him!
You whack him good.

31:48.139 --> 31:50.676
Hold him like that and whack him.
Hold it.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.051
Ow!

31:53.611 --> 31:57.616
Don't worry about that.
That's all a part of it.

31:57.782 --> 31:59.887
Come on, you want to try it again?

32:01.019 --> 32:03.158
Come on, one more time.

32:58.376 --> 32:59.411
Mama?

33:00.778 --> 33:02.621
Is that you?

33:08.786 --> 33:11.266
I've broken everything.

33:35.947 --> 33:40.225
<i>Strong animals know
when your heart is weak.</i>

33:41.953 --> 33:46.129
<i>That makes them hungry,
and they start coming.</i>

34:12.784 --> 34:14.786
Yo, Walrus.

34:14.952 --> 34:16.590
Hey, man.

34:18.723 --> 34:23.364
Come on, I gotcha. All right, partner.
I knew you wasn't gonna leave.

34:28.099 --> 34:30.579
I must've passed out.

34:33.204 --> 34:34.649
Little Jo..

34:36.774 --> 34:38.583
- Hey.
- You okay, huh?

34:38.743 --> 34:41.849
What happened to you? Get up.
Come on.

34:43.848 --> 34:48.297
He been talking all night long
how it's the last night on earth.

34:48.453 --> 34:51.730
Don't worry about him.
Trying to touch my titties and shit...

34:51.889 --> 34:54.165
...right in front of Peter T over there.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.429
- Oh, Peter T, my man.
- Hello.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.234
Good to see you, man!
I knew you wasn't gonna leave me.

34:59.397 --> 35:02.970
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- That's one classic dude right there.

35:03.134 --> 35:04.772
You a titan, man.

35:05.436 --> 35:07.313
Yeah! Glad you stayed, man.

35:09.540 --> 35:14.046
If I had a pair of wings,
I know I could have flown in that bad boy.

35:14.212 --> 35:16.954
Almost blew off
Walrus' panties, ha, ha, ha!

35:17.115 --> 35:19.322
But I would probably
have bounced off a tree.

35:29.594 --> 35:30.629
Hushpuppy.

35:32.196 --> 35:34.608
Did I ever tell you the story
about your conception?

35:34.765 --> 35:36.039
Jesus.

35:38.903 --> 35:43.045
One day, when me and Hushpuppy
mama first met...

35:43.207 --> 35:46.654
...we were so shy,
we used to sit around...

35:46.811 --> 35:51.021
...and drink beer
and smile at each other.

35:51.916 --> 35:56.490
One day, I got so shy, I just napped.

36:32.256 --> 36:35.260
<i>Back when Daddy
used to talk about Mama...</i>

36:36.127 --> 36:40.769
<i>...he said she was so pretty,
she never even had to turn on the stove.</i>

36:43.034 --> 36:45.310
<i>She'd just walk into the room...</i>

36:45.469 --> 36:48.075
<i>...and all the water starts to boil.</i>

37:05.723 --> 37:10.399
Your mama battered that gator up
and set it to frying.

37:14.131 --> 37:18.944
And Hushpuppy popped into the universe
about four minutes later.

37:27.345 --> 37:29.188
I got it under control.

38:31.008 --> 38:33.113
Miss Bathsheeba!

39:05.810 --> 39:09.019
Come on, y'all. Come on, girlie! Come on!

39:09.180 --> 39:10.716
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

39:10.881 --> 39:12.656
- That's it.
- Thank you.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.728
- Thank you. Very nice.
- Look what we got.

39:14.885 --> 39:17.525
We got the fresh catch today.
You like that, babe?

39:17.688 --> 39:19.326
Yeah! Come on!

39:19.490 --> 39:21.561
Come on, children,
I got some for y'all too.

39:22.259 --> 39:25.172
Yeah! Let's go. Time to eat.

39:29.834 --> 39:34.249
For the ones we never find,
we make a funeral the Bathtub way.

39:34.405 --> 39:37.318
Yeah, tastes like more.
Come on. All right.

39:37.475 --> 39:39.477
<i>With no crying allowed.</i>

39:40.244 --> 39:41.917
Yes, to the water!

39:43.614 --> 39:45.651
Come on, boy! Come on!

39:45.816 --> 39:48.228
Pick that goddamn thing up!
Let's go!

39:48.386 --> 39:49.490
Okay.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.765
So I say to myself...

39:53.924 --> 39:57.599
...I'm gonna pee in my pants just a little.
Hell, when the water goes down...

39:57.762 --> 40:00.003
...I'm gonna French kiss the dirt.

40:00.164 --> 40:02.235
The water ain't going down, man.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.142
That's my beautiful place
under that water.

40:05.302 --> 40:07.942
Everything beautiful is gone.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.314
Man, you know they got salt in that water,
done ate everything up.

40:14.645 --> 40:18.149
Trees are gonna die first,
then the animals, then the fish.

40:18.315 --> 40:20.522
You gotta think about moving.

40:20.684 --> 40:22.630
I got it under control.

40:26.123 --> 40:28.433
Come here, Hushpuppy.
Come sit by your Uncle Jean.

40:28.592 --> 40:31.300
Let me show you how to do this.
Here. Here, baby.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.269
Don't be scared of it, now.
Now, turn it upside-down.

40:34.432 --> 40:36.708
There you go.
Now, push it with your thumb.

40:37.468 --> 40:40.210
Good girl. That's it.

40:40.371 --> 40:45.445
And then, real careful,
take this knife and you pop this off.

40:46.410 --> 40:47.821
That's beautiful.

40:48.312 --> 40:50.155
No, HUSHPUPPY!

40:52.716 --> 40:54.161
Beast it.

40:59.356 --> 41:00.767
Beast it!

41:04.428 --> 41:05.463
Show me you can do it!

41:05.629 --> 41:07.506
- Come on, I know you can do it.
- Come on!

41:07.665 --> 41:08.769
- Beast it!
- Come on, now!

41:08.933 --> 41:11.573
Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!

41:11.735 --> 41:15.148
<i>Beast it! Beast it! Beast it!</i>

41:16.373 --> 41:18.375
Beast it. Beast it.

41:21.345 --> 41:22.756
Come on, now! Beast it!

41:24.081 --> 41:25.685
Yeah!

41:29.487 --> 41:32.195
Come on! Yeah! Yeah!

41:35.693 --> 41:38.765
You see what kind of family we got?
We got feeling!

41:40.264 --> 41:41.607
You're an animal!

41:42.500 --> 41:44.946
Yeah, you're an animal. Yeah.

41:52.610 --> 41:54.021
Yeah!

42:06.524 --> 42:10.495
<i>It wasn't no time to sit around
crying like a bunch of pussies.</i>

42:12.563 --> 42:16.010
<i>We're gonna make a camp
right on top of the Bathtub.</i>

42:22.473 --> 42:26.751
<i>We got enough animals to eat
until the water goes down.</i>

42:39.657 --> 42:41.136
Like this.

42:43.494 --> 42:45.303
Smoother. Gentler.

42:45.462 --> 42:47.703
Yeah, that's right. Right there.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.572
It's gonna be all right.

42:49.733 --> 42:51.804
Okay. Okay.

42:51.969 --> 42:55.815
That's the most important thing
I can ever teach y'all.

42:57.341 --> 43:01.653
Y'all got to learn how to take care
of people smaller and sweeter than you are.

43:03.347 --> 43:05.327
You got it.

43:05.482 --> 43:06.859
You okay?

44:35.572 --> 44:39.384
<i>Two weeks later,
everything started to die.</i>

45:38.001 --> 45:40.242
Got to get something out of this water.

45:48.112 --> 45:51.321
Walrus, you want to leave the Bathtub?

45:51.482 --> 45:52.859
No.

45:56.620 --> 45:58.258
I heard that.

46:02.526 --> 46:04.699
Nobody is leaving the Bathtub.

46:04.862 --> 46:06.535
You don't know nothing.

46:11.401 --> 46:15.713
This water gonna kill us here.
We gotta do something about this.

46:17.007 --> 46:21.422
I ain't starving to death while them people
going grocery shopping and all that.

46:46.970 --> 46:48.711
Shit. Son of a...

47:00.150 --> 47:02.892
Boss, Daddy got to go
take care of something.

47:04.588 --> 47:07.432
I'm gonna fix everything the way it was.

47:07.591 --> 47:10.663
- Where are you going?
- Don't worry. I'm the man.

47:10.828 --> 47:12.671
We gonna win.

47:12.830 --> 47:16.334
And if anything go wrong,
Walrus is daddy.

47:22.840 --> 47:26.185
You gonna be the king of the Bathtub.
I promise that.

47:28.445 --> 47:30.721
Just sit right there. I'll be back.

47:48.565 --> 47:51.546
I think they be gone.
I really can't say where.

47:51.702 --> 47:54.808
What are you
talking about? They go to the levee?

47:54.972 --> 47:57.282
- Ain't no problem.
- Don't make me slap your ass!

47:57.441 --> 48:01.014
You so much as piss on that wall,
you know what them people gonna do?

48:01.178 --> 48:03.556
They gonna find us
and stick us in a damn shelter.

48:06.016 --> 48:09.896
<i>Daddy says brave men don't run
from their home.</i>

48:11.054 --> 48:14.627
Peter T, hold onto the boat.
You're gonna be fine.

48:33.944 --> 48:38.086
Peter T, you hold the trip wire. Okay?

48:48.659 --> 48:52.163
- Get the line over there.
- Okay.

49:04.274 --> 49:08.552
<i>The entire universe depends on
everything fitting together just right.</i>

49:09.947 --> 49:14.555
<i>If you can fix the broken piece,
everything can go right back.</i>

49:14.718 --> 49:16.129
Come on, baby!

49:33.303 --> 49:34.873
Peter T...

49:35.372 --> 49:37.147
...hand me that trip wire.

49:37.307 --> 49:39.753
I'm so sorry, but...

49:39.910 --> 49:42.220
Peter T, you drop the trip wire?

49:42.379 --> 49:44.017
Well, yes, I did.

49:44.181 --> 49:47.685
- Peter T.
- I gotta go find it.

50:01.198 --> 50:02.472
Get over here!

50:02.666 --> 50:04.202
Aah! What are you doing, woman?

50:04.368 --> 50:06.314
I'm hauling your ass home, little boy.

50:06.470 --> 50:07.847
Get off!

50:08.005 --> 50:09.985
Touch that wall,
they gonna come after us.

50:10.140 --> 50:11.517
You don't know nothing!

50:11.675 --> 50:13.450
Jean Battiste! Get the trip line!

50:16.313 --> 50:19.351
Get in the boat!
Get your ass in here!

50:20.350 --> 50:21.385
HUSHPUPPY!

50:30.227 --> 50:31.262
Pull!

50:32.796 --> 50:35.538
- Pull, pull!
- Now, boss!

50:36.066 --> 50:37.977
- Now, boss!
- No!

52:27.811 --> 52:30.758
<i>It didn't matter
that the water was gone.</i>

52:32.916 --> 52:35.726
<i>Sometimes you can
break something so bad...</i>

52:36.419 --> 52:38.797
<i>...that it can't get put back together.</i>

53:06.483 --> 53:08.019
Mama!

53:12.455 --> 53:14.366
Mama!

53:14.858 --> 53:19.238
This is a mandatory evacuation area.
You can no longer live here.

53:24.334 --> 53:28.612
I repeat,
this is a mandatory evacuation area.

53:46.356 --> 53:50.566
<i>When you're small,
you gotta fix what you can.</i>

54:20.257 --> 54:22.203
Goddamn!

54:22.359 --> 54:25.829
What the hell wrong with you?
What you doing?

54:27.364 --> 54:30.004
- What you gonna do now, huh?
- Grr!

54:38.008 --> 54:41.012
Oh, you want to throw things, huh?
All right, I can do that too.

54:41.177 --> 54:43.453
Come on, then.
You want to play the game?

54:43.613 --> 54:46.219
Come on, let's throw stuff. Come on!

54:46.383 --> 54:48.863
I can do that too! So come on.

54:49.019 --> 54:51.659
You want to throw stuff? Come on!

54:53.423 --> 54:55.130
Come on. Aah!

54:55.692 --> 54:57.194
Come on!

54:59.029 --> 55:00.804
Ah! Ah! Ah!

55:00.997 --> 55:02.305
Aagh!

55:02.732 --> 55:04.575
Gotcha. Come on, come on!

55:05.468 --> 55:09.211
Aagh! Gotcha. Come on! Come on!

55:09.372 --> 55:10.874
Come on.

55:15.312 --> 55:16.689
Uh...

55:35.332 --> 55:37.642
Man, you think I don't know.

55:41.838 --> 55:44.148
You think I can't see?

55:47.410 --> 55:49.048
No crying.

55:52.882 --> 55:56.091
No crying, man! Hey!

55:56.252 --> 55:59.233
Goddamn it, I said no crying!

56:23.046 --> 56:24.923
Come on, get a drink.

56:53.276 --> 56:57.315
This counts as I'm sorry
for a whole bunch of things, Lord.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.872
You gonna be dead?

57:13.029 --> 57:14.372
No.

57:15.765 --> 57:17.972
You gonna leave me alone?

57:18.868 --> 57:20.677
No, I ain't gonna leave you alone.

57:20.837 --> 57:23.716
Because if you be gone, I be gone too.

57:23.873 --> 57:26.319
No, that's not how it work.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.685
Sometimes in the bed...

57:29.846 --> 57:34.192
...I start to shake and I can't stop.
I got what you got.

57:34.350 --> 57:38.230
No, that's just a side effect
of you being a stupid little girl.

57:39.155 --> 57:40.998
I ain't gonna be dead?

57:41.157 --> 57:44.161
No, you'll probably live
a hundred years more.

57:46.162 --> 57:49.769
Come on, let me see them guns.
Come on. Show me them guns.

57:49.933 --> 57:53.676
Let me see them.
Come on, show them to me.

57:54.571 --> 57:57.245
Show them to me.
Show me them guns!

57:57.407 --> 57:58.977
Show them to me! Guns!

57:59.142 --> 58:01.816
Guns! Guns! Guns!

58:01.978 --> 58:04.982
Gun! Guns! Come on. Come on.

58:07.116 --> 58:08.151
Come on!

58:09.519 --> 58:12.159
Come on! Let me have it!

58:14.157 --> 58:16.831
You the man! Who the man?

58:16.993 --> 58:18.768
- I'm the man.
- Yeah, you the man!

58:18.928 --> 58:20.839
- Who the man?
- I'm the man!

58:20.997 --> 58:22.977
- You the man! Who the man?
- I'm the man.

58:23.132 --> 58:26.545
- I'm the man! I'm the man!
- Yeah, you the man! Fuck this table. Shit!

58:38.248 --> 58:40.057
I got to go lay down.

58:40.550 --> 58:42.154
I got to get strong.

58:43.353 --> 58:45.128
Don't be scared.

58:57.734 --> 58:59.338
What?

59:05.074 --> 59:06.644
Come on.

59:17.153 --> 59:18.461
Lay down.

59:47.884 --> 59:50.831
- Hey.
- Yeah?

59:51.354 --> 59:53.925
You ain't the one that's sick.

01:00:35.832 --> 01:00:38.244
<i>Strong animals got no mercy.</i>

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.578
<i>They're the type of animals...</i>

01:00:46.743 --> 01:00:49.656
<i>...that eat their own mamas and daddies.</i>

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:11.809
Think someone is in there? I don't know.
This is a freaking shack.

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.845
Go check around the back.

01:01:14.303 --> 01:01:17.216
There's no one in there.
Look at this place.

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.516
- Will you please open the door?
- Get back.

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.217
This is a mandatory evacuation area.

01:01:26.916 --> 01:01:29.396
Everyone in this region has to leave.

01:01:29.552 --> 01:01:31.691
We ain't going nowhere!

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.794
Sir, we have food and shelter.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:35.629
- Kick it in.
- Go around the back.

01:01:35.792 --> 01:01:37.203
Let's go. Get in there.

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.771
Just remain calm.

01:01:38.928 --> 01:01:41.238
Son, you want me to cancel
your birth certificate?

01:01:41.397 --> 01:01:43.934
- Grab her arm!
- Son of a bitch!

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:47.206
- Get your hands off of me!
- Hold her down. Hold her down!

01:01:47.370 --> 01:01:49.941
- Stay down, sir.
- Stay down!

01:01:50.106 --> 01:01:53.246
- Let her go! I'm gonna kill you!
- You have her?

01:01:53.409 --> 01:01:54.752
Let her go!

01:01:54.911 --> 01:01:56.288
- Keep still.
- Let her go!

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.680
<i>It didn't look like a prison.</i>

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:23.215
<i>It looked more like a fish tank
with no water.</i>

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.555
<i>They said that we were here
for our own good.</i>

01:02:36.853 --> 01:02:39.197
You're supposed to hear me!
I want an answer!

01:02:39.355 --> 01:02:42.495
I don't have an answer.
The doctor is gonna have to give you that.

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:47.766
Don't eat that, hear?

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:52.974
Mr. Doucet, can I have a word with you?

01:02:53.136 --> 01:02:55.275
We found something in your test.

01:02:55.438 --> 01:02:57.975
- It's urgent...
- Whoa, whoa. Not in front of my kid.

01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.018
Stay there, Hushpuppy.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.679
- The procedure is...
- I said not in front of my kid.

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.518
The procedure is very risky.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:07.320
There's really no way to guarantee
it will be successful.

01:03:07.483 --> 01:03:09.190
In case anything happens...

01:03:18.127 --> 01:03:21.165
- Get your hands off me.
- If we don't do this, you could die.

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:25.841
- I tell you! I don't need nothing from you!
- Hey, stop it!

01:03:26.002 --> 01:03:28.141
- Mr. Doucet, calm down!
- Stop it! Come here.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:31.842
I tell you! I tell you!
You don't tell me!

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:35.114
- Calm down!
- Let me go! Get your hands off me!

01:03:35.278 --> 01:03:37.383
I don't need nothing from y'all.
Let me go!

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:38.958
Wink!

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:41.595
- Leave her alone!
- Let go of me!

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.855
Stop it!

01:03:43.686 --> 01:03:45.563
Get off of me!

01:03:45.721 --> 01:03:47.223
Daddy!

01:03:48.858 --> 01:03:53.398
You're gonna have time-out.
Are you even listening to me?

01:05:10.039 --> 01:05:12.485
<i>When an animal gets sick here...</i>

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:14.986
<i>...they plug it into the wall.</i>

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:38.612
They're coming for you.

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:43.510
<i>Daddy used to say that
if he ever got so old...</i>

01:05:43.673 --> 01:05:46.620
<i>...he couldn't drink beer
and catch catfish...</i>

01:05:46.776 --> 01:05:50.485
<i>...then I had to put him in the boat
and set him on fire...</i>

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.786
<i>...so no one could come plug him
into the wall.</i>

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.585
Dave.

01:05:55.751 --> 01:05:58.994
Dave, help me out. Help me out.

01:06:38.461 --> 01:06:40.236
Boss.

01:06:40.396 --> 01:06:43.309
Get up. We busting out of here.

01:06:43.466 --> 01:06:44.911
Come on.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:56.788
Wait, there's a person out there.

01:06:59.782 --> 01:07:01.284
Here you go.

01:07:10.993 --> 01:07:13.030
Hey! Go home!

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:15.197
Come on, let's go! Everybody get out!

01:07:19.268 --> 01:07:20.975
Wait, wait, wait.

01:07:21.137 --> 01:07:23.378
Let's go! Let's go!

01:07:40.623 --> 01:07:45.299
- Make sure you put her somewhere good.
- Let me out of here! No! No!

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:47.031
Let me go!

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:51.140
- Let me off!
- Get off me!

01:07:54.904 --> 01:07:58.818
You're trying to get rid of me!
You're trying to get rid of me!

01:08:02.545 --> 01:08:04.684
Listen to me.
I'm not trying to get rid of you.

01:08:04.847 --> 01:08:06.485
- Yes, you is.
- You don't understand!

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:09.721
I can't take care of you no more,
you understand?

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.558
I'm dying!

01:08:15.825 --> 01:08:18.169
My blood is eating itself.

01:08:18.894 --> 01:08:20.635
You know what that mean?

01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:24.868
Don't be saying things about dying.

01:08:26.167 --> 01:08:29.706
- Everybody daddies die.
- Not my daddy.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.749
Yeah, your daddy.

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:40.392
I didn't want you to watch that, okay?

01:08:41.884 --> 01:08:43.453
You understand?

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:55.700
Come on, let's go!

01:08:55.865 --> 01:08:59.278
Let's get out of here!
Let's get out of here! Come on!

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:01.415
Come on, let's go!

01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:06.578
Wait, wait, wait.

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:08.415
- Back up, back up.
- Girls, get back.

01:09:08.577 --> 01:09:12.923
- Dad! Come on! Come on!
- Give him room to breathe.

01:09:14.183 --> 01:09:16.094
Walrus, get me home.

01:10:06.235 --> 01:10:09.216
<i>Everybody loses the thing
that made them.</i>

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:15.080
<i>It's even how
it's supposed to be in nature.</i>

01:10:18.547 --> 01:10:21.687
<i>The brave men stay and watch it happen.</i>

01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:23.789
<i>They don't run.</i>

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.011
Come on!

01:11:57.980 --> 01:12:00.324
I'm going by my mom.

01:12:01.283 --> 01:12:03.524
That's a good place to go.

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.922
Which way are we going?

01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:33.117
It don't matter, baby.

01:12:33.282 --> 01:12:36.388
This boat will take you
exactly where you need to be.

01:12:38.053 --> 01:12:39.726
It's that kind of boat.

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:44.834
Want a chicken biscuit?

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.465
They're good for you.

01:12:51.133 --> 01:12:53.704
I've been eating these all my life.

01:12:55.137 --> 01:12:59.677
I keep the wrappers in the boat
because they remind me of who I was...

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.719
...when I ate each one.

01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:05.950
The smell makes me feel cohesive.

01:13:06.949 --> 01:13:09.088
I want to be cohesive.

01:13:09.251 --> 01:13:12.630
I'm sure you will, baby.
No doubt in my mind.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.787
Oh, hi.

01:14:11.947 --> 01:14:15.121
Sergeant Major, how are you doing?

01:14:15.284 --> 01:14:17.195
Hey, Miss Frankie.

01:14:17.686 --> 01:14:19.688
Holy crap. You have toddlers.

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:23.496
- A whole litter of them.
- Oh, they are so cute.

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.679
They're so cute.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.373
Hey, baby.

01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.140
<i>I'd work for you
I'd even slave for you</i>

01:15:10.138 --> 01:15:13.210
<i>I'd be a beggar or a knave for you</i>

01:15:14.877 --> 01:15:17.949
<i>And if that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

01:15:19.481 --> 01:15:23.054
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

01:15:47.409 --> 01:15:49.616
You need something, baby?

01:15:53.148 --> 01:15:56.152
Well, what you want? You alone?

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.199
That's it?

01:16:04.927 --> 01:16:07.999
Get in here.
Let me show you a magic trick.

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.227
Let me tell you something.

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:35.561
When you're a child,
people say that life...

01:16:35.724 --> 01:16:38.500
...is gonna be happy
and hunky-dory and all that bullshit...

01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:43.131
...but I'm here to tell you that it's not, so
you need to get that out your head right now.

01:16:43.298 --> 01:16:46.336
Because, yeah, life is some big old feast,
but you...

01:16:48.170 --> 01:16:50.275
...ain't nothing
but a stupid little waitress.

01:16:50.772 --> 01:16:54.049
One day, everything on your plate
gonna fall on the floor.

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:57.151
And nobody gonna be there
to pick it up for you.

01:16:57.312 --> 01:17:01.055
One day, it's gonna be all on you.

01:17:01.617 --> 01:17:03.790
You understand what I'm saying?

01:17:10.392 --> 01:17:11.666
So smile, girl.

01:17:14.329 --> 01:17:15.535
Smile.

01:17:16.531 --> 01:17:20.570
Because nobody like
a pity-party-having-ass woman.

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.452
The gator is magic.

01:17:32.514 --> 01:17:34.858
Oh. Mm-hm.

01:17:56.271 --> 01:17:58.012
You can take care of me.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.277
Me and Daddy.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.490
Don't know nothing about your daddy.

01:18:03.645 --> 01:18:06.819
I can't take care of nobody but myself.

01:18:07.649 --> 01:18:10.459
<i>And if that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

01:18:10.619 --> 01:18:12.394
You can stay if you want.

01:18:12.554 --> 01:18:15.228
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:18.965
<i>I'd gladly move</i>

01:18:19.461 --> 01:18:21.668
This is my favorite thing.

01:18:21.963 --> 01:18:24.466
<i>To prove my love, dear, and its worth</i>

01:18:24.633 --> 01:18:26.078
I know.

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:29.677
<i>If that isn't love,
It'll have to do</i>

01:18:29.838 --> 01:18:32.819
<i>I can count all the times I've been lifted.</i>

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:39.490
<i>I can count all the times I've been lifted
on two fingers.</i>

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:44.096
Wink! Bring my baby here!

01:18:44.252 --> 01:18:46.391
We got to wash her up!

01:18:46.555 --> 01:18:48.398
No, that waits.

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:56.233
All right, fatso, breathe some air.

01:19:02.804 --> 01:19:04.579
I need to go home.

01:19:40.909 --> 01:19:43.981
<i>If that isn't love
It'll have to do</i>

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.684
<i>Until the real thing comes along</i>

01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:13.734
You're my friend, kind of.

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:27.282
I gotta take care of mine.

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.691
Real good.

01:24:36.204 --> 01:24:38.241
No crying, hear?

01:24:40.208 --> 01:24:41.949
No crying.

01:24:58.693 --> 01:25:00.468
Don't you cry.

01:26:09.063 --> 01:26:14.843
As I stand by the bayou,
I watch a ship as she disappears.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.448
There, she is gone.

01:26:16.604 --> 01:26:19.084
And we cry for this.

01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:20.947
But she's not gone.

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:24.818
She's just as real as when she left me.

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:28.188
And somewhere else,
other voices are calling out:

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:29.953
"Here she comes."

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:32.291
And that is dying.

01:26:32.453 --> 01:26:35.366
Here she comes!

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:49.212
<i>When it all goes quiet
behind my eyes...</i>

01:26:49.370 --> 01:26:51.441
<i>...I see everything that made me...</i>

01:26:51.606 --> 01:26:54.553
<i>...flying around in invisible pieces.</i>

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:02.524
<i>When I look too hard, it goes away.</i>

01:27:03.484 --> 01:27:07.261
<i>But when it all goes quiet,
I see they are right here.</i>

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:13.169
<i>I see that I'm a little piece
of a big, big universe.</i>

01:27:14.262 --> 01:27:16.401
<i>And that makes things right.</i>

01:27:20.835 --> 01:27:24.681
<i>When I die, the scientists of the future...</i>

01:27:24.839 --> 01:27:27.376
<i>...they're going to find it all.</i>

01:27:27.542 --> 01:27:29.215
<i>They're going to know...</i>

01:27:30.044 --> 01:27:31.682
<i>...once, there was a Hushpuppy...</i>

01:27:31.846 --> 01:27:34.656
<i>...and she lived with her daddy
in the Bathtub.</i>
