WEBVTT

00:01.380 --> 00:01.979
A toast.

00:01.980 --> 00:04.638
To the McArthurs in the playoffs.

00:04.758 --> 00:06.612
- Cheers to that.
- Yeah.

00:07.294 --> 00:09.524
And not just two McArthurs
in the playoffs.

00:09.526 --> 00:10.325
How about Taco?

00:10.327 --> 00:13.069
Well, that boy just rode
Arian Foster the entire way.

00:13.071 --> 00:17.114
Taco versus Andre-- that is a
frittata versus a fantasy frittata.

00:17.116 --> 00:20.518
Either way, one of us is playing
a frittata for the Shiva!

00:20.520 --> 00:21.354
It's crazy.

00:21.356 --> 00:22.021
It's so good.

00:22.023 --> 00:25.390
I was thinking, this year it'd be
really fun to do a friendly wager.

00:25.392 --> 00:26.026
Mmm.

00:26.028 --> 00:26.895
Between us.

00:26.897 --> 00:28.030
Okay.

00:28.032 --> 00:30.066
If I win... Mm-hmm.

00:30.068 --> 00:32.503
...I would like to have another baby.

00:32.506 --> 00:33.137
Wow.

00:33.139 --> 00:34.438
There, I said it.

00:34.440 --> 00:35.139
Really do.

00:35.141 --> 00:39.876
I was thinking, like, a month of back rubs, but...
We could do both.

00:39.878 --> 00:44.113
All right, Kevin McArthur,
if you bring home a healthy

00:44.115 --> 00:51.118
six-pound Shiva trophy, I will cook
you one sweet healthy McArthur baby.

00:51.120 --> 00:52.787
This is great!

00:52.789 --> 00:54.957
I am so excited, you have no idea.

00:54.959 --> 00:55.959
Yeah?

00:55.961 --> 00:57.627
I'm telling you, you're
not gonna regret this.

00:57.629 --> 00:58.094
Yeah?

00:58.096 --> 00:59.731
I have so much on the line now.

01:00.367 --> 01:01.066
gotta win.

01:01.068 --> 01:04.102
I mean, look, yes, it's gonna be a
change in our life-- Are you okay?

01:05.105 --> 01:07.106
All right, just get it
down the right pipe.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.075
Easy.

01:09.077 --> 01:11.110
All right, relax.

01:15.015 --> 01:16.416
Did you just check the TV?

01:16.418 --> 01:17.584
While I'm choking?

01:17.586 --> 01:20.188
No, I-- you know, there was a...
a little ticker at the

01:20.190 --> 01:21.624
bottom about LaGarrette Blount.

01:21.626 --> 01:24.127
But that-- I was, I was
concerned about you.

01:24.129 --> 01:25.328
Are you okay?

01:26.130 --> 01:27.129
Ow.

01:27.131 --> 01:27.897
Yeah.

01:27.899 --> 01:28.998
I'm so much better now.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.999
So strong when you're angry.

01:31.119 --> 01:36.421
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrected by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:36.541 --> 01:40.445
I just glanced away for a second to see
the LaGarrette Blount ticker, and I was

01:40.447 --> 01:41.079
right back.

01:41.081 --> 01:43.649
Yeah, it's not like you're
responsible for her safety or anything.

01:43.651 --> 01:44.651
Well, theoretically I am.

01:44.653 --> 01:46.585
'Cause you're more
attractive than she is.

01:46.587 --> 01:48.921
Look, babe, I just got to a
meeting, so I got to roll.

01:48.923 --> 01:49.621
Lies, lies.

01:49.623 --> 01:53.125
But I will talk to you when
you get ho-- H-Hello? Hello?

01:53.127 --> 01:53.926
What happened?

01:53.928 --> 01:54.795
Dropped the call.

01:54.797 --> 01:57.164
I pay $150 a month, and my
phone can't complete calls.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.434
The app I want for my phone is "phone."

01:59.436 --> 02:01.236
You know what, you could develop
that app, now that you

02:01.238 --> 02:04.773
have all this free time in the losers'
bracket, away from the Shiva Bowl.

02:04.775 --> 02:06.542
Oh, you know what, you
could help me with it.

02:06.544 --> 02:09.312
Actually, you both are one
loss away from being in the Sacko.

02:09.314 --> 02:10.479
How the mighty have fallen.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.681
First to worst.

02:12.350 --> 02:14.117
Oh, Sofia's calling me.

02:14.119 --> 02:15.352
Hey, girlfriend.

02:15.354 --> 02:17.821
No, he's not in a meeting,
he's at the bar with me.

02:17.823 --> 02:19.322
Uh, I don't know.

02:19.324 --> 02:20.123
Were you in an accident?

02:20.125 --> 02:23.026
Every time I have a dropped call, she
thinks I've been in an accident.

02:23.028 --> 02:23.660
Are you okay?

02:23.662 --> 02:25.128
No, I got decapitated, you platypus.

02:25.130 --> 02:25.862
I don't know.

02:25.864 --> 02:26.830
He says he got decapitated.

02:26.832 --> 02:27.730
Give me that phone.

02:27.732 --> 02:28.898
Hey, baby.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.133
No, it just dropped the call.

02:30.135 --> 02:32.837
Why are people so obsessed about finding
out <i>why</i> you dropped the call?

02:32.839 --> 02:35.140
All of a sudden, everyone
becomes a cell phone Columbo.

02:35.142 --> 02:38.043
"I think it was the truck,
or maybe it was the hills."

02:38.045 --> 02:39.978
Okay, babe, I'll pick
up the roast chicken.

02:39.980 --> 02:43.582
I love you, I love you.

02:44.986 --> 02:45.752
See you later.

02:45.754 --> 02:46.386
Bye-bye, buddy.

02:46.388 --> 02:47.153
Marital bliss.

02:47.155 --> 02:50.056
You know, the choking, the accidents--
we're living in a dangerous world.

02:50.058 --> 02:53.926
That's why I want you to all know
that I am available to be your ICE.

02:53.928 --> 02:54.594
Ice?

02:54.596 --> 02:55.361
What's ice?

02:55.363 --> 02:57.163
No, no, "in case of emergency" contact.

02:57.165 --> 02:58.164
I got Jenny.

02:58.166 --> 03:00.566
I've got...
Yeah, mine's my homeless friend Doak.

03:00.568 --> 03:01.533
Doak doesn't have a phone.

03:01.535 --> 03:02.334
He has a walkie-talkie.

03:02.336 --> 03:05.104
All right, well, I'm offering
you guys an upgrade.

03:05.106 --> 03:07.339
I'm a doctor, I'm
available at all times.

03:07.341 --> 03:09.107
Actually, could I get
Doak's contact from you?

03:09.109 --> 03:10.008
I could use a backup.

03:10.010 --> 03:12.678
All you need to do is buy a
walkie-talkie, turn it to channel six.

03:12.680 --> 03:13.412
Channel six, got it.

03:13.414 --> 03:14.046
Thank you.

03:14.048 --> 03:15.548
You know what, think about it.

03:15.550 --> 03:17.117
We don't have to make
a decision right now.

03:17.119 --> 03:18.118
The door is open.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.019
Eh, close it.

03:19.021 --> 03:19.619
Close that up.

03:19.621 --> 03:20.387
Close it up.

03:20.389 --> 03:22.456
Door's unlocked, so you can
just keep on opening it up.

03:22.458 --> 03:24.792
Just do a little...
Guess what, I'm by the window.

03:24.794 --> 03:25.426
Hi, guys.

03:25.428 --> 03:27.128
Oh, we got to nail that one down.

03:27.130 --> 03:28.630
This one over here, too, all right?

03:28.632 --> 03:29.130
Just close.

03:29.132 --> 03:30.131
Paint it shut.

03:30.133 --> 03:30.766
There we go.

03:30.768 --> 03:31.399
Put them there.

03:31.401 --> 03:32.401
What's this?

03:33.804 --> 03:34.636
You blew up the house.

03:34.638 --> 03:35.804
You should call your ICE.

03:35.806 --> 03:37.139
I don't have one.

03:37.141 --> 03:37.939
Ooh.

03:37.941 --> 03:39.041
Hey, I can use Doak?

03:39.043 --> 03:41.109
Mm, he's got a lot on his plate.

03:41.111 --> 03:43.145
I thought I was gonna be
in the playoffs, at least.

03:43.147 --> 03:45.881
I certainly didn't think I was gonna
end up in the goddamn Sacko Bowl.

03:45.883 --> 03:46.781
No one ever does.

03:46.783 --> 03:49.451
Guess I just feel like, is this it?

03:49.453 --> 03:51.620
Like, is this really my life?

03:51.622 --> 03:55.991
You ever just... you ever just
think about throwing it all away?

03:55.993 --> 03:58.127
Just take a little step, and all
of a sudden, you're just...

03:58.129 --> 03:58.761
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

03:58.763 --> 03:59.629
No, no, no, no, no.

03:59.631 --> 04:00.430
Stop! Stop it! Stop.

04:00.432 --> 04:01.164
I'm just saying, Kevin.

04:01.166 --> 04:02.833
I've decided to commit Shivacide.

04:02.835 --> 04:04.435
No, you can't do that.

04:04.437 --> 04:07.305
Benching players to intentionally
lose is against the rules.

04:07.307 --> 04:10.008
So is changing the draft order
at the front of the season.

04:10.010 --> 04:11.843
You know I did not want to do that.

04:11.845 --> 04:12.744
Kevin, this is very simple.

04:12.746 --> 04:15.313
The teams with the two worst
records end up in the Sacko Bowl.

04:15.315 --> 04:18.850
If I lose this week, no matter
whether Ruxin wins or loses, he

04:18.851 --> 04:22.421
ends up in the Sacko Bowl with me, and
I know that I can crush him there.

04:22.423 --> 04:23.122
Wait, are you sure?

04:23.124 --> 04:24.123
Yes, I've done my homework.

04:24.125 --> 04:26.592
I've looked at the tiebreakers,
I've crunched all the numbers.

04:26.594 --> 04:30.095
I sacrifice myself for the
greater good of the league.

04:30.097 --> 04:31.029
You're like an angel.

04:31.031 --> 04:32.097
I prefer saint.

04:32.099 --> 04:32.864
Saint Peter.

04:32.866 --> 04:33.981
Bless you, my son.

04:35.633 --> 04:36.477
Lunch?

04:36.597 --> 04:37.770
Yeah, let's do that.

04:40.608 --> 04:43.543
Guys, I know I've been chewing your
ear off all year about Taco Corp.

04:43.545 --> 04:44.244
Yeah.

04:44.246 --> 04:44.878
Yes.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.013
You guys are probably really
sick of hearing about it.

04:47.015 --> 04:47.547
Definitely.

04:47.549 --> 04:48.348
Absolutely.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.916
Because it's not real.

04:49.918 --> 04:50.916
Finally.

04:50.918 --> 04:51.918
Thank you.

04:51.920 --> 04:55.522
That's why I've decided to
incorporate Taco Corp for real.

04:57.292 --> 05:01.261
Ruxin, as my lawyer and wartime
consigliere, I need to

05:01.263 --> 05:03.096
discuss these matters further with you.

05:03.098 --> 05:07.067
All right, Ruxin, before we get
to business, buy me a drink.

05:07.069 --> 05:07.935
Why?

05:07.937 --> 05:10.904
'Cause in business, the host
buys the visitor the drinks.

05:10.906 --> 05:12.473
You invited me for the drink, Taco.

05:12.475 --> 05:15.242
Yeah, but you're my lawyer, so you're
probably gonna do most of the talking.

05:15.244 --> 05:16.043
Hey, hey, hey.

05:16.045 --> 05:16.744
That's my phone.

05:16.746 --> 05:17.445
Give me that back.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.112
What are you doing?

05:18.114 --> 05:18.746
Oh, nothing.

05:18.748 --> 05:21.215
I just added myself as your ICE.

05:21.217 --> 05:23.984
Now you can call each other and talk
about not being in the playoffs.

05:23.986 --> 05:24.985
"Hey, Andre, it's Pete.

05:24.987 --> 05:25.886
It's an emergency.

05:25.888 --> 05:28.221
I'm not in the playolas, and
I'm not sure I ever will be."

05:28.223 --> 05:30.890
Andre, you accepted your own
Facebook invitation to me?

05:30.892 --> 05:31.491
Yes.

05:31.493 --> 05:32.892
It was sitting there for ages.

05:32.894 --> 05:34.092
No, seven years.

05:34.094 --> 05:37.463
And the reason I want you for this
job is because I respect you.

05:37.465 --> 05:38.464
I don't respect you at all.

05:38.466 --> 05:41.834
And the reason I respect you is
because you remind me of a young me.

05:41.836 --> 05:42.768
You're younger than me.

05:42.770 --> 05:45.537
Wide-eyed, naive, stealing
other people's mail.

05:45.539 --> 05:46.772
And you're a decent lawyer.

05:46.774 --> 05:49.142
Not the best, but you're a friend.

05:49.144 --> 05:50.009
You're not my friend.

05:50.011 --> 05:51.745
You can have a whole
career at Taco Corp.

05:51.747 --> 05:52.479
I have no interest.

05:52.481 --> 05:54.014
And you get to work
very closely with me.

05:54.016 --> 05:55.549
I can't stand being around you.

05:55.551 --> 05:56.483
We'd be glad to have you.

05:56.485 --> 05:57.317
I'm not doing it.

05:57.319 --> 05:58.484
Welcome on board.

05:58.486 --> 06:01.087
I have no interest in being
on your board, Taco.

06:01.089 --> 06:04.557
And it makes me crazy that you
somehow drooled your way to the

06:04.559 --> 06:07.193
playoffs, and so it ends right now.

06:07.195 --> 06:09.362
I cannot say it clear enough:

06:09.364 --> 06:10.496
no.

06:10.498 --> 06:13.767
Fine, we'll just part ways and
you'll buy me that drink.

06:13.769 --> 06:16.369
It's like talking to a block of marble.

06:16.371 --> 06:18.705
I just can't get it up
for college football.

06:18.707 --> 06:20.907
It's kind of weird to just
watch a football game with no

06:20.909 --> 06:21.808
ulterior motives or agendas.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.910
Ellie, I hope you're doing your
own homework in there and

06:23.912 --> 06:25.511
not having Uncle Taco do it for you.

06:25.513 --> 06:26.178
All right.

06:26.180 --> 06:27.947
Don't talk to her like she's a child.

06:27.949 --> 06:29.215
She is a child, Taco.

06:29.217 --> 06:32.452
And I'll know if the homework
is done by you, honey, okay?

06:32.454 --> 06:33.186
The handwriting.

06:33.188 --> 06:34.520
No one will be able to tell.

06:34.522 --> 06:36.022
That's not a compliment.

06:36.024 --> 06:37.123
You realize that, right?

06:37.125 --> 06:40.393
All right, just... If he keeps helping
her, she's gonna get left back.

06:40.395 --> 06:42.161
Hey, did you see my lineup this week?

06:42.163 --> 06:43.128
It is on.

06:43.130 --> 06:44.129
Okay, what have you done?

06:44.131 --> 06:45.531
Hakeem Nicks-- eh, I don't know.

06:45.533 --> 06:47.299
Looked like he was maybe
limping a little bit.

06:47.301 --> 06:48.867
What if I start Percy Harvin instead?

06:48.869 --> 06:50.535
Slow subtle maneuvers.

06:50.537 --> 06:53.104
And, yeah, Saint Pete will
have his ass handed to him in

06:53.106 --> 06:57.476
week 15, but Ruxin's players are all on
teams that are going to the playoffs.

06:57.478 --> 06:58.143
Mm-hmm.

06:58.145 --> 07:02.081
So they're gonna be sitting on the bench
in Week 16, and I will crush him.

07:02.083 --> 07:03.082
That's the way it should be.

07:03.084 --> 07:04.918
Putting a beard on Andre
and making him play flute?

07:04.920 --> 07:05.485
Nothing.

07:05.487 --> 07:07.488
That's nothing compared
to what's coming.

07:07.490 --> 07:08.188
Child's play.

07:08.190 --> 07:08.989
Now, check this out.

07:08.991 --> 07:12.060
I have come up with a couple of
things I wanted to show you.

07:12.062 --> 07:14.496
I've run some very extensive scenarios.

07:14.498 --> 07:15.396
What the hell is this?

07:15.398 --> 07:17.432
And I've come up with
this-- an alternate season.

07:17.434 --> 07:18.900
If we didn't cheat.

07:18.902 --> 07:19.701
Don't say that.

07:19.703 --> 07:21.803
Now, look, the draft order
would essentially have been

07:21.805 --> 07:24.105
Ruxin first, and he probably
would've taken Adrian Peterson.

07:24.107 --> 07:26.573
But it's almost irrelevant when
you crunch all the numbers, and

07:26.575 --> 07:28.341
I still would've made the playoffs.

07:28.343 --> 07:31.377
The trajectory that I'm on to the
Shiva would've happened anyway.

07:31.379 --> 07:33.579
All right, you need to take
this and put this back in your

07:33.581 --> 07:36.015
Trapper Keeper, and you need to
do a better job hiding it than

07:36.017 --> 07:37.283
you did with that gun of yours.

07:37.285 --> 07:38.785
Pete, Pete!

07:38.787 --> 07:40.019
What's the emergency?

07:40.021 --> 07:41.220
Andre, thank God you're here.

07:41.222 --> 07:42.121
Just in time.

07:42.123 --> 07:43.289
I need a ride home.

07:43.291 --> 07:44.757
That's not an emergency.

07:44.759 --> 07:46.392
Well, it's an emergency to me.

07:46.394 --> 07:48.361
And while you're up, could
I get a Bud Light, too?

07:48.363 --> 07:51.731
Okay, no, we have to talk about what
constitutes an actual emergency.

07:51.733 --> 07:54.000
Well, if you get him a beer like
you're supposed to, then he

07:54.002 --> 07:55.201
won't be able to drive home;

07:55.203 --> 07:56.202
hence the emergency.

07:56.204 --> 07:58.805
Just having, like, second thoughts
about this whole ICE thing.

07:58.807 --> 08:00.740
Andre, you're a doctor;
you took an oath.

08:00.742 --> 08:03.110
Look, this is not some episode
of <i>Diff'rent Strokes</i>

08:03.112 --> 08:05.112
<i>where I'm Willis's butler for a week.</i>

08:05.114 --> 08:06.479
<i>A Hippocratic oath.</i>

08:06.481 --> 08:07.948
<i>More like hypocritic oath.</i>

08:07.950 --> 08:08.782
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:08.784 --> 08:09.883
<i>Okay, I'll get you a beer.</i>

08:09.885 --> 08:10.483
<i>Awesome, thanks.</i>

08:10.485 --> 08:11.484
<i>Can I get one, too?</i>

08:11.486 --> 08:12.118
<i>No.</i>

08:12.120 --> 08:13.487
<i>He needs it; it's an emergency.</i>

08:13.489 --> 08:14.788
<i>Ah, I'm thirsty.</i>

08:14.790 --> 08:15.456
<i>Fine.</i>

08:15.458 --> 08:16.423
<i>Thank you.</i>

08:16.425 --> 08:17.925
<i>I'm getting beers.</i>

08:17.927 --> 08:19.727
<i>Help yourself.</i>

08:19.729 --> 08:21.162
<i>What are you doing?</i>

08:21.164 --> 08:23.264
<i>I'm helping Ellie with her assignment.</i>

08:23.266 --> 08:24.465
<i>It's to draw her hero.</i>

08:24.467 --> 08:26.901
<i>And for some weird reason,
she chose her father.</i>

08:26.903 --> 08:27.502
<i>Aw!</i>

08:27.504 --> 08:29.304
<i>And here's the picture.</i>

08:29.306 --> 08:30.939
<i>Oh... What is this?</i>

08:30.941 --> 08:31.840
<i>Why am I naked?!</i>

08:31.842 --> 08:33.509
<i>Ellie did not draw that.</i>

08:33.510 --> 08:35.344
<i>No, no, no, I helped her with this one.</i>

08:35.346 --> 08:37.980
<i>Taco, she can't bring this into
a second grade classroom!</i>

08:37.982 --> 08:41.349
<i>I'm sorry the crotchal region
is not flattering, but it's</i>

08:41.351 --> 08:41.917
<i>accurate.</i>

08:41.919 --> 08:43.484
<i>It's inappropriate, is what it is.</i>

08:43.486 --> 08:44.518
<i>Are you upset about the bend?</i>

08:44.520 --> 08:46.520
<i>Look, that's a McArthur
family tradition.</i>

08:46.522 --> 08:47.855
<i>No, it's a lilt, first of all.</i>

08:47.857 --> 08:48.522
<i>Whoa.</i>

08:48.524 --> 08:49.490
<i>That's a bend.</i>

08:49.492 --> 08:51.124
<i>Anything past 19 degrees is a bend.</i>

08:51.126 --> 08:52.192
<i>I can fix that if you want.</i>

08:52.194 --> 08:52.825
<i>No.</i>

08:52.827 --> 08:54.494
<i>Technically, that's a
medical emergency.</i>

08:54.496 --> 08:56.029
<i>You are never touching my dick again.</i>

08:56.031 --> 08:57.864
<i>You give me the sign,
I'll do it at night.</i>

08:57.866 --> 09:02.536
<i>Taco, the fact that you drew an
anatomically correct version</i>

09:02.538 --> 09:03.771
<i>of my husband is just wrong.</i>

09:03.773 --> 09:06.841
<i>Not 100% anatomically...
I gave you an extra inch... No.</i>

09:06.843 --> 09:08.810
<i>...because it's about
hero worship, right?</i>

09:09.479 --> 09:10.478
<i>What's wrong with her?</i>

09:10.480 --> 09:12.781
<i>And what's even more creepy
is that you used an actual</i>

09:12.783 --> 09:13.949
<i>photograph for my head.</i>

09:13.951 --> 09:15.951
<i>Yeah, dicks: great at drawing them.</i>

09:15.953 --> 09:17.052
<i>Balls: not so much.</i>

09:17.054 --> 09:18.119
<i>Faces: not at all.</i>

09:18.121 --> 09:20.488
<i>Why don't you just concentrate
a little more on faces?</i>

09:20.490 --> 09:22.942
<i>I still got a lot of
work to do on dicks.</i>

09:23.062 --> 09:25.360
<i>But then again, I'm my harshest critic.</i>

09:27.624 --> 09:32.645
DeMarco Murray is out, which means
Felix Jones will be cleaning up.

09:32.910 --> 09:35.778
Let's take a little walk over to
the waiver wire, and guess who's

09:35.780 --> 09:39.972
got number one priority on the waiv...
Taco?

09:41.000 --> 09:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:48.595 --> 09:49.227
Hello?

09:49.229 --> 09:49.995
Hey, Taco!

09:49.997 --> 09:50.930
Ruxin.

09:50.932 --> 09:53.933
Yeah, I want to take you out to dinner,
and just, like, pick your brain.

09:53.935 --> 09:54.700
Huh?

09:54.702 --> 09:59.371
Come on, Taco and Ruxin... BFFs.

09:59.373 --> 10:00.606
It's not in there!

10:00.608 --> 10:01.574
How do you lose a briefcase?

10:01.576 --> 10:02.341
I don't know.

10:02.343 --> 10:04.010
Ellie plays with things,
she moves things around.

10:04.012 --> 10:05.111
How am I supposed to keep track?

10:05.780 --> 10:06.379
Oh!

10:06.381 --> 10:07.013
What?

10:07.015 --> 10:07.613
Change.

10:07.615 --> 10:08.381
That's not important.

10:08.383 --> 10:11.751
We're looking for the stupid alternative
league universe thing you created.

10:11.753 --> 10:13.386
Hey, I worked really hard on that.

10:13.388 --> 10:14.954
Well, you better work
harder on finding it.

10:14.956 --> 10:16.389
Well, what am I supposed to do?!

10:16.391 --> 10:17.390
I don't know where it is!

10:17.392 --> 10:19.760
Well, we have a lot to talk about,
so I'm glad you agreed to

10:19.762 --> 10:20.594
business dinner with me.

10:20.596 --> 10:21.762
To <i>have</i> a business dinner.

10:21.764 --> 10:23.397
No, we're gonna business dinner.

10:23.399 --> 10:24.966
Last week, I business
dinnered with Doak.

10:24.968 --> 10:26.968
Taco, "business dinner" is not a verb.

10:26.970 --> 10:27.602
Yes, it is.

10:27.604 --> 10:29.404
Like "moonwalk" or "karate."

10:29.406 --> 10:30.272
Okay.

10:30.274 --> 10:33.209
I don't want you to worry about the
cost of the business dinnering tonight.

10:33.211 --> 10:34.410
It's on me.

10:34.412 --> 10:35.811
All right, buddy?

10:35.813 --> 10:37.413
I can pay, Taco.

10:37.415 --> 10:39.782
'Cause you're basically
a homeless person.

10:39.784 --> 10:42.318
Um, Ellie, have you
seen Daddy's briefcase?

10:42.320 --> 10:43.218
Oh, yeah.

10:43.220 --> 10:45.954
Uncle Taco took it for his
dinner meeting with Ruxin.

10:45.956 --> 10:47.756
Dinner meet-- what do you
mean "dinner meeting"?

10:47.758 --> 10:48.824
It's for Taco Corp.

10:48.826 --> 10:50.425
It's the end of the fiscal year.

10:50.427 --> 10:51.360
God, okay.

10:51.362 --> 10:54.129
If Ruxin sees what's in that briefcase,
this whole season is toast.

10:54.131 --> 10:55.230
All right, all right, relax.

10:55.232 --> 10:58.733
Honey, did Uncle Taco tell you where
he was holding that business dinner?

10:58.735 --> 11:01.103
Well, not exactly, but he
gave me these to play with.

11:01.105 --> 11:02.304
He gave you matches?

11:02.306 --> 11:03.305
"Obscura."

11:03.307 --> 11:04.940
That's that stupid restaurant downtown.

11:04.942 --> 11:06.275
You're gonna love this place.

11:06.277 --> 11:07.743
It's dining in the dark.

11:07.745 --> 11:08.678
Dining in the dark?

11:08.680 --> 11:12.849
Welcome to Obscura, where the only
sense you need is your sense of taste.

11:12.851 --> 11:13.950
Is this joker blind?

11:13.952 --> 11:16.387
This joker is blind, but he's not deaf.

11:16.389 --> 11:18.989
All of our staff have been
trained to provide excellent

11:18.991 --> 11:20.623
service in complete darkness.

11:20.625 --> 11:21.925
Thank you, Joker.

11:21.927 --> 11:22.659
Come this way.

11:22.661 --> 11:23.660
This is gonna be great.

11:23.662 --> 11:25.162
And totally not awkward.

11:25.164 --> 11:25.829
Come this way.

11:25.831 --> 11:26.663
Give me your hand.

11:27.399 --> 11:29.967
Mm, someone napped in
their car this afternoon.

11:29.969 --> 11:32.003
Wasn't my car.

11:32.005 --> 11:33.404
How dark we talking here?

11:33.406 --> 11:34.972
Jesus, it's pitch black.

11:35.608 --> 11:36.207
Ow!

11:36.209 --> 11:36.941
Watch your step.

11:36.943 --> 11:37.675
You got it, Joker.

11:37.677 --> 11:39.210
Is this the kitchen door?

11:39.212 --> 11:40.611
Okay, you ready to do this?

11:40.613 --> 11:41.412
Yeah, let's do it.

11:41.414 --> 11:42.279
Let's hit it.

11:42.281 --> 11:43.347
Boom!

11:43.349 --> 11:44.014
Get it.

11:44.016 --> 11:44.782
Quiet.

11:44.784 --> 11:45.416
Let's go.

11:46.419 --> 11:48.619
Holy shit, it works.

11:48.621 --> 11:49.354
This is awesome.

11:49.356 --> 11:50.822
Okay.

11:50.824 --> 11:52.357
I don't
know what that means.

11:52.359 --> 11:53.125
What are you doing?

11:53.127 --> 11:54.159
Come in and split up.

11:54.161 --> 11:54.994
What's wrong with you?

11:54.996 --> 11:56.862
All right.

11:56.864 --> 11:58.364
Waiter, waiter, waiter.

11:58.366 --> 12:00.999
Back up, back up.

12:09.209 --> 12:11.076
I hope you're enjoying
your dining experience.

12:11.078 --> 12:14.813
Mm-hmm.

12:14.815 --> 12:16.381
Wait, there he is, there he is.

12:16.383 --> 12:17.148
Oh.

12:17.150 --> 12:18.016
Okay, go.

12:18.018 --> 12:19.184
...in-depth business plan.

12:19.186 --> 12:22.988
I'll lay it out in my briefcase, which
I will bring out in a few seconds.

12:22.990 --> 12:23.588
Mm-hmm.

12:23.590 --> 12:25.924
The first investment I'm thinking:
underwater theme parks.

12:25.926 --> 12:27.092
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

12:27.094 --> 12:30.329
So I wanted to hear your opinion
on some of the ideas that I had.

12:30.331 --> 12:31.029
That's awesome.

12:31.031 --> 12:34.900
And I know that you're very--
Did you, did you take my wine?

12:34.902 --> 12:35.601
No.

12:35.603 --> 12:38.037
Maybe you just have no sense
of where things are anymore.

12:38.039 --> 12:39.872
No, no, no, I'm used
to being in the dark.

12:39.874 --> 12:42.609
I drank out of a puddle when I
was seven, was blind for a week.

12:42.611 --> 12:46.247
Since I'm now part of the Taco
Corp family, you know how

12:46.249 --> 12:48.850
you have the priority on
the waiver wire this week?

12:48.852 --> 12:49.417
Mm-hmm.

12:49.419 --> 12:53.422
And I was thinking, maybe if you
just sort of sat back, then

12:53.424 --> 12:55.857
I could come in and grab Felix Jones.

12:55.859 --> 12:59.361
Okay, well, you see, all my instincts
are telling me to say no right now.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.364
But I think there's a little guy on
my shoulder telling me to say yes.

13:02.366 --> 13:04.199
So, you got it.

13:04.201 --> 13:05.800
Yes!

13:05.802 --> 13:10.205
Now that we've filled our stomachs, I
would like to show you my business plan.

13:10.207 --> 13:11.373
And it is in my briefcase.

13:11.375 --> 13:14.376
It's gonna be hard to read, but
I'm gonna bring that out for you.

13:14.378 --> 13:15.311
Uh-huh.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.781
Did someone open the window?

13:18.783 --> 13:19.915
I don't know, Taco.

13:19.917 --> 13:22.651
I got some pepperoni wind in my face.

13:22.653 --> 13:24.220
And here.

13:25.924 --> 13:26.656
Yes!

13:26.658 --> 13:27.390
That was awesome!

13:27.392 --> 13:28.391
We just did that!

13:28.393 --> 13:29.125
Let's see the loot.

13:29.127 --> 13:33.095
It's all paperwork, stuff for work...
Maybe it's in that one.

13:33.097 --> 13:33.896
All right, hold on.

13:33.898 --> 13:35.331
Let me look in this one.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.099
What?

13:36.101 --> 13:37.400
Stupid Taco.

13:37.402 --> 13:40.837
You know what?

13:40.839 --> 13:41.971
Think I left it at work.

13:41.973 --> 13:43.139
You dumb-ass.

13:43.141 --> 13:43.773
I know.

13:43.775 --> 13:44.407
Oh, well.

13:44.409 --> 13:47.110
The most important thing is, if it's
not in there, Ruxin didn't see it.

13:47.112 --> 13:47.744
Okay, yeah.

13:47.746 --> 13:49.412
You still got to find
this thing, though.

13:50.015 --> 13:51.748
Want me to give you a lift home?

13:51.750 --> 13:53.149
No, this sounds like an emergency.

13:53.151 --> 13:54.150
I think I'll, uh, call Andre.

13:54.152 --> 13:56.987
Ah, good idea.

13:56.989 --> 13:58.355
So big there...

14:02.159 --> 14:03.259
Dez Bryant's out?

14:03.261 --> 14:04.360
It's two hours before game time.

14:04.362 --> 14:06.363
All right, I need somebody
on the waiver wire here.

14:07.399 --> 14:09.866
Oh, no! Crap.

14:12.770 --> 14:13.704
Hi. I am so sorry, Officer.

14:13.706 --> 14:15.706
Well, you know why I pulled you over?

14:15.708 --> 14:16.840
Texting while driving.

14:16.842 --> 14:17.841
I'm actually not texting.

14:17.843 --> 14:18.875
Was changing my lineup.

14:18.877 --> 14:21.879
Well, it's the same thing-- using
your phone while operating a vehicle.

14:21.881 --> 14:23.380
I'm gonna have to give you a ticket.

14:23.382 --> 14:24.381
Okay.

14:24.383 --> 14:26.383
License, registration, proof
of insurance, please?

14:26.385 --> 14:27.818
Sure. There you go.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.153
Can I ask you a question?

14:29.155 --> 14:30.220
Okay.

14:30.222 --> 14:32.222
Jabar Gaffney, Lance Moore-- your gut.

14:32.224 --> 14:34.624
'Cause I have been down the
Lance Moore path many a time.

14:34.626 --> 14:36.360
I don't know who those characters are.

14:36.362 --> 14:38.294
What kind of game are you playing?

14:38.296 --> 14:40.296
Characters? They're not...
Is it <i>World of Warcraft?</i>

14:40.298 --> 14:41.330
It's not <i>World of Warcraft.</i>

14:41.332 --> 14:42.298
<i>These are football players.</i>

14:42.300 --> 14:43.900
<i>Jabar sounds like a wizard to me.</i>

14:43.902 --> 14:45.902
<i>Yeah, I wish he was a
wizard at touchdowns.</i>

14:45.904 --> 14:47.904
<i>Okay, sir, could you
put your phone down?</i>

14:47.906 --> 14:48.404
<i>Okay.</i>

14:48.406 --> 14:49.405
<i>Sir, put the phone down.</i>

14:49.407 --> 14:50.139
<i>Okay.</i>

14:50.141 --> 14:52.075
<i>Sir, clearly, you're still doing it.</i>

14:52.077 --> 14:54.043
<i>Sorry, I'm sorry. I</i> just...
Put down the phone, sir.

14:54.045 --> 14:54.877
It's a playoff week.

14:54.879 --> 14:57.246
I mean, you're writing me a ticket
for texting, so let me just text.

14:57.248 --> 14:59.749
It's, like, if you're gonna arrest me
for murder, let me murder the person.

14:59.751 --> 15:01.350
Murder? All right, sir,
step out of the car.

15:01.352 --> 15:02.318
That was a bad example.

15:02.320 --> 15:03.319
Step out of the car, sir!

15:03.321 --> 15:04.320
I didn't murder anybody.

15:04.322 --> 15:05.321
Just give me the phone.

15:05.323 --> 15:09.326
No, just one second, just one second...
Give me the phone!

15:09.328 --> 15:10.327
Hello?

15:10.329 --> 15:11.328
Hey, hey! It's Andre!

15:11.330 --> 15:12.329
Where you been?

15:12.331 --> 15:13.930
I've been texting you all morning.

15:13.932 --> 15:14.931
What's going on?

15:14.933 --> 15:16.933
My car got impounded, and I
need 500 bucks to get it out.

15:16.935 --> 15:18.402
So can you come down
here and pick me up?

15:18.404 --> 15:20.370
You know what, I'm already at Kevin's.

15:20.372 --> 15:21.371
That's not super convenient.

15:21.373 --> 15:22.372
Well, this is an emergency.

15:22.374 --> 15:23.373
You're my emergency contact.

15:23.375 --> 15:24.374
That's the thing, Andre.

15:24.376 --> 15:26.376
I'm not your emergency contact anymore.

15:26.378 --> 15:28.378
What do you mean you're
not my emergency contact?

15:28.380 --> 15:29.379
I traded you to Taco.

15:29.381 --> 15:31.915
What?! I don't want Taco
as my emergency contact.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.918
I wouldn't even trust
him to do my laundry.

15:33.920 --> 15:36.287
Hey, I had to throw in Jason
Witten just to sweeten the deal.

15:36.289 --> 15:37.288
Jason Witten?

15:37.290 --> 15:39.290
With Dez Bryant out,
he's gonna crush me.

15:39.292 --> 15:41.292
You know, he's playing me this week.

15:41.294 --> 15:43.294
Whoa. God, that does
sound like an emergency.

15:43.296 --> 15:44.862
Coming, Andre! Don't worry!

15:44.864 --> 15:46.029
I'll save you!

15:46.031 --> 15:47.030
Oh, great, here he comes.

15:47.032 --> 15:48.398
Have fun.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.633
Don't worry about it.

15:49.635 --> 15:51.068
Thank you so much.

15:51.070 --> 15:52.069
Mwah! See you later.

15:52.071 --> 15:53.070
What's your emergency?

15:53.072 --> 15:54.071
My car got impounded.

15:54.073 --> 15:56.073
What I need to do is
get it out of here.

15:56.075 --> 15:57.074
Yeah, you do.

15:57.076 --> 15:58.742
You're my ride back to Kevin's house.

15:58.744 --> 15:59.643
What about that girl?

15:59.645 --> 16:01.745
I don't know, I don't even
know her phone number.

16:01.747 --> 16:03.347
What do you mean you don't
have her phone number?

16:03.349 --> 16:04.348
I don't even know her name.

16:04.350 --> 16:05.349
Do you have any money?

16:05.351 --> 16:06.444
No, I was gonna borrow some from you.

16:06.564 --> 16:07.662
No, this is <i>my</i> emergency.

16:07.782 --> 16:09.053
I need the money from <i>you.</i>

16:09.055 --> 16:12.056
<i>Look, I'm here, I'm your emergency
contact, I'm gonna help you out.</i>

16:12.058 --> 16:12.623
<i>Oh.</i>

16:12.625 --> 16:13.624
<i>Ooh.</i>

16:13.626 --> 16:14.625
<i>God! What's in there?</i>

16:14.627 --> 16:18.028
<i>Oh, yeah.
I turned it into a sandwich bag.</i>

16:18.148 --> 16:19.352
<i>That's an old baloney sandwich.</i>

16:19.472 --> 16:20.631
<i>You know what, I'm gonna walk.</i>

16:22.607 --> 16:25.233
I can't believe I was this close
to the The Shiva and then

16:25.353 --> 16:27.515
you had to trade Jason Witten to Taco.

16:27.635 --> 16:29.235
Congratulations, Taco.

16:29.237 --> 16:30.236
You're going to The Shiva Bowl!

16:30.238 --> 16:31.598
Oh. Cool.

16:31.718 --> 16:32.717
All right, I'm late.

16:32.719 --> 16:33.718
What did I miss?

16:33.720 --> 16:34.419
What's going on?

16:34.421 --> 16:36.465
Well, I'll tell you what-- got
some good news for you, Ruxin.

16:36.585 --> 16:38.722
- Yeah?
- You are winning.

16:38.724 --> 16:39.723
Whoa, there.

16:39.725 --> 16:40.724
There we go.

16:40.726 --> 16:42.727
But you do realize it's
probably all for naught?

16:42.729 --> 16:43.728
What do you mean?

16:43.730 --> 16:46.064
Because the teams with the two
worst records automatically

16:46.066 --> 16:47.365
go to the Sacko Bowl.

16:47.367 --> 16:50.336
Right. So Ted, Pete... Not if he loses.

16:50.338 --> 16:53.706
So basically, no matter what happens to
him, if I lose he goes to the Sacko?

16:53.708 --> 16:55.708
Yep, because of all the tiebreakers.

16:55.710 --> 16:56.843
That's crazy!

16:56.845 --> 16:57.844
Well, how is your team doing?

16:57.846 --> 17:01.381
I am actually losing, with
only Tolbert left to play.

17:01.383 --> 17:03.016
What's going on with him in the game?

17:03.018 --> 17:04.984
I haven't really seen him
since the first half.

17:04.987 --> 17:06.019
I don't know what's going on.

17:06.021 --> 17:07.020
But he's the Vulture.

17:07.021 --> 17:08.589
He's sort of like a sick vulture.

17:08.590 --> 17:10.691
Yeah, the Vulture's a little ill.

17:13.362 --> 17:16.363
Uh, it looks like you and I are
gonna be in the Sacko together.

17:16.365 --> 17:18.365
You don't seem that upset about this.

17:18.367 --> 17:21.367
You know, you win some, you lose
some-- I'm at peace with it, really.

17:21.369 --> 17:22.002
Hm.

17:22.003 --> 17:25.006
You know, Ruxin, you keep making
that face, it might freeze that way.

17:25.008 --> 17:27.441
If I keep making this finger, you
think it'll freeze this way, too?

17:27.443 --> 17:28.409
First to worst, buddy.

17:28.411 --> 17:29.410
Something stinks here.

17:29.412 --> 17:30.844
I made a Cheerio fart.

17:30.846 --> 17:33.681
You know, what
I smelled was betrayal.

17:33.683 --> 17:36.417
Are you... are you crying?

17:36.419 --> 17:37.418
No, I'm not crying!

17:37.420 --> 17:41.055
This is bullshit!

17:41.057 --> 17:42.423
Bless you, my sons.

17:42.425 --> 17:44.892
You, Pete, you should
be canonized for that.

17:44.894 --> 17:45.893
That was awesome.

17:45.895 --> 17:47.195
He was crying!

17:47.197 --> 17:48.963
Like a real person.

17:48.965 --> 17:50.564
Fart! Fart!

17:50.566 --> 17:51.965
Goddamn collusion!

17:51.967 --> 17:54.268
This is not the way it
was supposed to go!

17:54.270 --> 17:55.269
I'm the league champion!

17:55.271 --> 17:56.270
I'm the league champion!

17:56.272 --> 18:00.373
Ruxin, you're being a
real dick to my frog.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.608
What is this, Ellie?

18:01.610 --> 18:02.743
Daddy's hair pills.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.244
I'm making my daddy a collage.

18:04.246 --> 18:07.147
Propecia? Is that why his
hairline goes halfway down his

18:07.149 --> 18:08.649
forehead like Teen Wolf?

18:09.919 --> 18:11.585
Thanks for the ammo, Ellie.

18:11.587 --> 18:12.952
What's this?

18:12.954 --> 18:13.953
It's my hero collage.

18:13.955 --> 18:14.954
I chose Daddy.

18:14.956 --> 18:15.956
Your daddy's your hero?

18:15.958 --> 18:16.957
Mm-hmm.

18:16.959 --> 18:20.394
You should aim higher, like a
low-end bookie or a spare tire.

18:20.396 --> 18:21.729
What is this?

18:21.731 --> 18:24.397
Oh, this is the papers
Daddy works on every day.

18:24.399 --> 18:27.066
"Alternate league draft order"?

18:27.068 --> 18:29.268
I knew there was collusion.

18:29.270 --> 18:30.403
Whoa!

18:30.405 --> 18:32.404
Hey! That's my homework!

18:32.406 --> 18:33.839
Get bent!

18:33.841 --> 18:38.243
Oh, come on, you'd think I'd get
more from the Baltimore D than this.

18:38.245 --> 18:40.912
This is <i>exactly</i> how
I saw this going down.

18:40.914 --> 18:43.748
Down seven points and San
Diego's still driving.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.250
Come on, guys!

18:45.252 --> 18:49.354
First the Shiva Bowl, next...
Mother of the Year Award.

18:49.356 --> 18:52.323
Wow, a Jenny-Taco Shiva Bowl.

18:52.325 --> 18:53.358
Boring.

18:53.360 --> 18:55.359
Yeah. I'm not excited about it, either.

18:55.361 --> 18:57.861
An all-McArthur Shiva Bowl,
and I'm not even in it.

18:57.863 --> 19:01.198
You know, I did not set up this
league to have a trophy end up

19:01.200 --> 19:03.835
with my wife's name on it
or as a bong in my attic.

19:03.837 --> 19:05.370
And I'm destined to never win it.

19:05.372 --> 19:07.439
Maybe you're like Moses, you
know-- you're supposed to

19:07.441 --> 19:09.675
<i>lead</i> the people from the
desert but you're not allowed to go

19:09.677 --> 19:11.010
into the promised land yourself.

19:11.012 --> 19:12.011
Look at this! Look at this!

19:12.013 --> 19:13.012
Holy shit. Interception.

19:13.014 --> 19:14.013
Two points.

19:14.015 --> 19:15.014
Go for the sideline.

19:15.016 --> 19:16.015
Keep going, Ed Reed.

19:16.017 --> 19:17.016
He's got one guy to beat.

19:17.018 --> 19:18.017
What?

19:19.021 --> 19:20.020
Aah...!

19:20.022 --> 19:22.388
Whoa, whoa, wh... Yeah!

19:22.390 --> 19:23.990
Oh, my God!

19:23.992 --> 19:24.990
You saved me.

19:24.992 --> 19:25.991
Kevin, six more points!

19:25.993 --> 19:26.992
You won!

19:26.994 --> 19:28.327
I didn't even see the play.

19:28.329 --> 19:31.130
You took your eyes off the
game and you saved me.

19:31.132 --> 19:33.398
And I beat you.

19:33.400 --> 19:34.399
Suck it!

19:34.401 --> 19:36.635
Oh, I love you did great.

19:36.637 --> 19:37.636
Oh!

19:37.638 --> 19:39.204
I'm going to the Shiva Bowl!

19:39.206 --> 19:40.205
Hey!

19:40.207 --> 19:41.407
Shiva committee!

19:41.409 --> 19:45.011
Someone get the drum!

19:45.013 --> 19:46.645
What is this?

19:46.647 --> 19:47.646
Ellie's homework.

19:47.648 --> 19:50.316
This is why I wanted a new
kid-- this one's no good.

19:50.318 --> 19:53.919
You cheated me in the draft order, and
you thought you could outsmart Ruxin!

19:53.921 --> 19:55.821
Ruxin, just look at what I drew
up-- you'll see there was

19:55.823 --> 19:57.690
no difference in either
way-- I'm telling you!

19:57.692 --> 20:02.929
I'm not looking at anything, 'cause
all I see are lies and collusion!

20:02.931 --> 20:05.431
This whole season is null and void!

20:05.433 --> 20:07.033
Vull and noid!

20:09.938 --> 20:11.104
What?

20:11.106 --> 20:15.275
Sofia? Yeah, you're not gonna
believe what the other guys did to me.

20:15.277 --> 20:18.111
Yeah... No, they totally betrayed me.

20:18.113 --> 20:19.446
Hello? Hello?

20:19.448 --> 20:22.282
Whoa!

20:22.284 --> 20:24.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:24.453 --> 20:25.452
Ruxin?

20:25.454 --> 20:28.423
Oh, my God, I think
he's having a stroke.

20:28.425 --> 20:29.691
Hello?

20:29.693 --> 20:30.792
Hello?

20:30.794 --> 20:34.463
Ugh! Rodney, you got to get
a new cell phone provider.

20:34.465 --> 20:36.365
He's frozen in Ruxin face.

20:36.367 --> 20:39.735
Now, even though he didn't choose me as
his emergency contact, I will help him.

20:39.737 --> 20:41.136
Okay, Ruxin, can you hear me?

20:42.139 --> 20:44.206
I'm going to give you mouth-to-mouth.

20:45.442 --> 20:50.411
Okay... all right... okay...

20:50.413 --> 20:52.813
He's fighting-- this is a good sign.

20:52.815 --> 20:53.981
I'm trying to help you!

20:56.419 --> 20:57.417
I think he is breathing fine.

20:57.419 --> 20:59.419
I think we're supposed to pee on him.

20:59.421 --> 21:00.420
That's jellyfish, you idiot!

21:00.422 --> 21:02.422
Might not help, but it can't hurt.
