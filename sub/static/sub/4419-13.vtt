08:34.100 --> 08:34.965
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:34.967 --> 08:36.366
I'M DECLARING
SHENANIGANS ON YOU.

08:36.368 --> 08:37.601
THIS GAME IS RIGGED.

08:37.603 --> 08:38.569
SHENANIGANS?

08:38.571 --> 08:39.536
WHAT'S ALL THE HOO-HA?

08:39.538 --> 08:42.673
OFFICER, I'M GOING TO DECLARE
SHENANIGANS ON THIS OPERATOR.

08:42.675 --> 08:43.474
WHY?

08:43.476 --> 08:44.374
THIS GAME IS FIXED.

08:44.376 --> 08:45.876
THE BALLS ARE BIGGER THAN
JENNIFER LOVE HEWITT'S MOUTH.

08:45.878 --> 08:49.813
IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN YOUR
DECLARATION OF SHENANIGANS
IS JUST.

08:49.815 --> 08:52.149
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY,
CARNIVAL OPERATOR?

08:52.151 --> 08:53.617
LOOK, THE KID WAS
REALLY CLOSE.

08:53.619 --> 08:55.052
HE STILL HAS
ANOTHER BALL LEFT.

08:55.054 --> 08:57.321
LET'S TRY AGAIN, SON.

08:57.323 --> 08:59.656
HERE YA GO.

09:00.593 --> 09:01.558
THERE, YA SEE?

09:01.560 --> 09:02.826
WE HAVE A WINNER.

09:02.828 --> 09:03.393
IT WORKED.

09:03.395 --> 09:06.563
YOUNG MAN, YOU CAN'T JUST GO
DECLARING SHENANIGANS ON
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

09:06.565 --> 09:08.198
THAT'S HOW WARS
GET STARTED.

09:08.200 --> 09:09.600
SORRY, OFFICER BUTT-BABY.

09:09.602 --> 09:10.300
BARBRADY.

09:10.302 --> 09:11.735
OH, I'M SORRY.
WHAT DID I SAY?

09:11.737 --> 09:13.804
YOU SAID BUTT-BABY.

09:14.507 --> 09:15.873
HA, HA, HA.

09:15.875 --> 09:16.707
OKAY, KID, YOU WON.

09:16.709 --> 09:19.710
YOU GET TO PICK BETWEEN
THE BARBIE POCKET MIRROR
AND THE BON JOVI TOOTHPICK.

09:19.712 --> 09:22.146
NO, DUDE. I WANT THE
TERRANCE AND PHILLIP DOLLS.

09:22.148 --> 09:24.982
OH, NO, YOU GOT TO WIN
7 TIMES TO EARN THOSE.

09:24.984 --> 09:25.883
WHAT?

09:25.885 --> 09:28.318
YOU WIN 7 BON JOVI TOOTHPICKS,
THEN YOU CAN TRADE THEM IN

09:28.320 --> 09:29.753
FOR THE TERRANCE AND PHILLIP
DOLLS.

09:29.755 --> 09:31.121
YOU DIRTY
SON OF A BITCH!

09:31.123 --> 09:32.489
YOU NEVER TOLD US
THAT WE HAD TO...

09:32.491 --> 09:33.957
STEP ON UP,
JUST FIVE DOLLARS TO PLAY.

09:33.959 --> 09:36.026
DAMN IT, I HAVE TO
HAVE THOSE DOLLS!

09:36.028 --> 09:38.162
THIS IS HOPELESS.
WE'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY TO WIN.

09:38.164 --> 09:39.997
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT IT.

09:39.999 --> 09:41.932
THE BULL RIDING CONTEST.

09:41.934 --> 09:44.701
CARTMAN COULD RIDE A BULL
AND TRY TO WIN $5,000.

09:44.703 --> 09:47.237
THINK ABOUT IT, DUDE,
$5,000!

09:47.239 --> 09:49.339
THAT'S ONE THOUSAND
SET OF BALLS.

09:49.341 --> 09:50.707
THAT'S 3,000 BALLS.

09:50.709 --> 09:52.142
WE'D HAVE TO WIN
ENOUGH TO GET THE DOLLS.

09:52.144 --> 09:53.844
WHAT THE HELL MAKES YOU THINK
CARTMAN RIDES A BULL?

09:53.846 --> 09:57.948
BECAUSE YOU SPENT ALL OF OUR
MONEY ON THOSE STUPID RIDES,
FAT ASS.

09:57.950 --> 09:59.149
NOW, EITHER
YOU'RE GETTING ON A BULL

09:59.151 --> 10:01.318
OR I'M GOING TO BREAK YOUR
FUCKING HEAD OPEN.

10:01.320 --> 10:04.188
OKAY, I'LL
GET ON A BULL.

10:04.190 --> 10:05.055
ALL RIGHT.

10:05.057 --> 10:06.256
NOW COME ON, YOU
HAVE TO PRACTICE.

10:06.258 --> 10:08.192
HE REALLY WANTS
THOSE DOLLS.

10:08.194 --> 10:10.160
I GUESS, DAMN.

10:12.064 --> 10:13.330
THAT RIDE
WASN'T VERY GOOD.

10:13.332 --> 10:16.066
NOW, MARY, YOU PROMISED ME
WE'D TRY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

10:16.068 --> 10:18.035
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M SORRY, HONEY.

10:18.037 --> 10:20.571
I'LL TRY AND HAVE
A GOOD TIME.

10:29.848 --> 10:31.815
( bell tolls )
MOO, MOO.

10:31.817 --> 10:34.985
(all)
MOO, MOO.

10:40.226 --> 10:44.094
HEY, THIS MECHANICAL BULL IS
GOING TO HELP YOU PRACTICE FOR
THE REAL THING, CARTMAN.

10:44.096 --> 10:45.229
HEY, THIS IS SWEET.

10:45.231 --> 10:46.930
YOU GOT TO TRY AND STAY ON FOR
TEN SECONDS, OKAY, CARTMAN?

10:46.932 --> 10:49.032
I'LL TRY, TEN SECONDS
IS A LONG TIME.

10:49.034 --> 10:51.268
WE'LL START ON SLOW
AND WORK OUR WAY UP.

10:51.270 --> 10:53.237
READY, GO.

10:54.406 --> 10:57.140
AH, SON OF A BITCH.

10:57.142 --> 10:58.175
HOW LONG
WAS THAT?

10:58.177 --> 10:59.743
THAT WASN'T
QUITE TEN SECONDS.

10:59.745 --> 11:00.410
DAMN IT!

11:00.412 --> 11:01.445
THAT WASN'T TEN SECONDS,
CARTMAN.

11:01.447 --> 11:02.980
YOU HAVE TO DO
BETTER THAN THAT.

11:02.982 --> 11:04.681
MY BACK.

11:04.683 --> 11:06.650
GET BACK ON, FAT ASS.
YOU HAVE TO PRACTICE.

11:06.652 --> 11:08.885
( mumbling )

11:08.887 --> 11:10.621
SCREW YOU GUYS,

11:10.623 --> 11:11.855
HATE YOU GUYS.

11:11.857 --> 11:13.523
WHAT DID YOU SAY,
CARTMAN?

11:13.525 --> 11:14.124
HATE YOU GUYS.

11:14.126 --> 11:16.460
I THINK HE SAID HE WANTS TO
PRACTICE ON A REAL BULL.

11:16.462 --> 11:18.462
HATE YOU GUYS.

11:26.305 --> 11:27.671
MOO, MOO.

11:27.673 --> 11:29.273
MOO, MOO.

11:29.275 --> 11:31.275
MOO.

11:33.746 --> 11:35.312
BE CAREFUL WITH
OLD BOB, HERE.

11:35.314 --> 11:38.448
HE AIN'T MUCH FOR RIDING
ANYMORE, BUT HE'S ALL I GOT.

11:38.450 --> 11:39.249
WELL, HE'LL HAVE TO DO.

11:39.251 --> 11:41.018
CARTMAN HAS TO GET SOME
PRACTICE WITH A REAL BULL.

11:41.020 --> 11:42.519
WELL, HAVE FUN, BOYS.

11:42.521 --> 11:43.987
OKAY, CARTMAN,
YOU READY?

11:43.989 --> 11:44.888
NA.

11:44.890 --> 11:46.323
OPEN THE GATE.

11:49.995 --> 11:53.130
OH, YEAH, GOD DAMN,
THIS IS MY KIND OF BULL RIDE.

11:53.132 --> 11:55.599
THAT BULL SUCKS, HE'S NOT
EVEN BUCKING OR ANYTHING.

11:55.601 --> 11:57.501
YEAH, THIS IS SWEET.

11:57.503 --> 11:58.268
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

11:58.270 --> 11:59.770
HIT THE BULL IN
THE BALLS WITH
A SNOWBALL.

11:59.772 --> 12:02.039
OH, YEAH, THAT'S
A GOOD IDEA.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.675
AH, AH!

12:04.677 --> 12:05.609
THAT'S BETTER.

12:05.611 --> 12:06.810
HOLD ON, CARTMAN.

12:06.812 --> 12:08.011
AH, AH, AH!

12:08.013 --> 12:10.714

CRAZY THING!

12:10.716 --> 12:12.316
MOTHERFU--

12:12.851 --> 12:15.752
GET UP, CARTMAN. YOU'RE
STILL NOT STAYING
ON LONG ENOUGH.

12:15.754 --> 12:17.654
COME ON, CARTMAN.

12:17.656 --> 12:20.090
OH, MY GOD!
THEY KILLED CARTMAN!

12:20.092 --> 12:22.326
NO, WE DIDN'T KILL HIM.
HE'S STILL BREATHING.

12:22.328 --> 12:23.727
GET UP!

12:24.830 --> 12:26.229
GET UP!

12:28.801 --> 12:30.701

12:31.770 --> 12:33.737
CARTMAN, HELLO?

12:33.739 --> 12:35.772
HELLO.

12:35.774 --> 12:37.741
DUDE, I THINK
WE BROKE HIM.

12:38.410 --> 12:41.945
BOYS, I'M AFRAID YOUR FAT
LITTLE FRIEND HAS SUFFERED
HEAD TRAUMA.

12:41.947 --> 12:43.013
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?

12:43.015 --> 12:46.983
WELL, APPARENTLY HE THINKS HE'S
A VIETNAMESE PROSTITUTE
NAMED MING LEE.

12:46.985 --> 12:47.818
OH.

12:47.820 --> 12:49.252
BUT CAN HE STILL
RIDE A BULL?

12:49.254 --> 12:49.720
WHAT?

12:49.722 --> 12:50.921
WE NEED HIM TO WIN
THE BULL RIDING CONTEST

12:50.923 --> 12:52.389
SO WE CAN GET TERRANCE
AND PHILLIP DOLLS.

12:52.391 --> 12:53.657
CAN HE STILL DO IT?

12:53.659 --> 12:54.191
NO, BOYS.

12:54.193 --> 12:56.727
YOU NEED TO TAKE HIM HOME AND
LET HIM GET PLENTY OF SLEEP.

12:56.729 --> 12:57.694
DAMN IT!

12:57.696 --> 13:00.530
CARTMAN, CARTMAN?

13:03.469 --> 13:05.936
( speaking in Vietnamese )

13:05.938 --> 13:08.138

13:08.140 --> 13:09.773
( speaking in Vietnamese )

13:09.775 --> 13:11.441
OH, YEAH, DUDE, LET'S GET

13:11.443 --> 13:15.145

WE'RE NOT GOING TO
STAND FOR THIS.

13:17.850 --> 13:21.451
WE'RE GONNA FIND YOU
AND KILL YOU!

13:24.256 --> 13:25.222
ALL RIGHT, HOW ABOUT THIS?

13:25.224 --> 13:31.128
WHOEVER TOOK THE SACRED COW,
JUST PLEASE RETURN HIM AND
THERE'LL BE NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

13:32.231 --> 13:33.764
WAIT A MINUTE, YOU FOLKS
FROM OUT OF TOWN,

13:33.766 --> 13:37.834
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONES
WITH A REASON TO TAKE
OUR BELOVED COW MEMORIAL.

13:37.836 --> 13:41.371
WHERE ARE WE GOING
TO PUT A 60-FOOT TALL
STATUE OF A COW?

13:41.373 --> 13:45.709
WELL, I THINK MAYBE YOU'LL
ANSWER THAT DOWNTOWN, TOURIST.

13:45.711 --> 13:47.677
OH, MY GOD!

13:49.181 --> 13:49.880
HOW'S HE DOING?

13:49.882 --> 13:51.481
HE STILL THINKS HE'S A
VIETNAMESE PROSTITUTE.

13:51.483 --> 13:54.251
( speaking Vietnamese )

13:54.253 --> 13:55.952
DO YOU THINK HE CAN
RIDE THE BULL?

13:55.954 --> 13:57.254
YEAH, I THINK SO.

13:57.256 --> 13:57.854
COOL.

13:57.856 --> 14:01.458
HEY, SOLDIER BOY?

14:12.337 --> 14:13.069
COME ONE, COME ALL,

14:13.071 --> 14:16.740
THE CHAMBER OF FARTS HAS BEEN
FIXED AND IS REOPENED.

14:17.843 --> 14:18.809
JESUS, DUDE.

14:18.811 --> 14:20.744
HEY, WHERE'S CARTMAN?

14:20.746 --> 14:21.745
OH, HELL.

14:21.747 --> 14:22.512
( mumbling )

14:22.514 --> 14:23.346
KENNY, YOU GO
FIND CARTMAN.

14:23.348 --> 14:24.948
WE HAVE TO SIGN HIM UP
FOR THE BULL RIDE.

14:24.950 --> 14:26.316
OKAY.

14:27.586 --> 14:28.785
OH, IT'S SO COLD HERE.

14:28.787 --> 14:30.487
WHERE IS THAT SHERIFF?

14:30.489 --> 14:31.555
WE NEED WATER.

14:31.557 --> 14:33.457
OH, WELL, LET'S TRY TO
MAKE THE BEST OF IT, MARY.

14:33.459 --> 14:35.892
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT BEING POSITIVE.

14:35.894 --> 14:38.028
AT LEAST WE GET
SOME TIME ALONE.

14:38.030 --> 14:41.631
YEAH, AND AT LEAST
WE'VE GOT OUR HEALTH.

14:42.067 --> 14:43.099
I'LL TELL YOU, MITCHELL,

14:43.101 --> 14:44.334
I AIN'T NEVER SEEN
NOTHING LIKE IT.

14:44.336 --> 14:45.535
WHERE ARE
THEY AGAIN?

14:45.537 --> 14:47.838
JUST RIGHT UP
OVER THIS RIDGE.

14:50.642 --> 14:52.709
( cows mooing )

14:56.315 --> 14:57.948
THAT'S WHAT THEY'VE
BEEN DOING ALL MORNING,

14:57.950 --> 14:59.249
JUST SITTING THERE
AND MOOING.

14:59.251 --> 15:00.584
AND MORE COWS
COME ALL THE TIME.

15:00.586 --> 15:02.118
WELL, I AIN'T NEVER

15:02.120 --> 15:04.721
BUT I KNOW ONE THING, WHEN
COWS START GETTING TOGETHER,

15:04.723 --> 15:05.822
IT CAN'T BE GOOD.

15:05.824 --> 15:07.724
THEY MIGHT START
FORMING A CULT.

15:07.726 --> 15:12.963
HMM, COW CULT.

15:12.965 --> 15:14.998
HERE IT IS, THE GRANDDADDY

15:27.179 --> 15:28.812
HE'S UP IN

15:28.814 --> 15:30.113
( mumbling )

15:30.115 --> 15:32.249

15:32.251 --> 15:33.149
THERE HE IS.

15:33.151 --> 15:36.253
SUCKIE, SUCKIE,

15:43.362 --> 15:45.929
THERE THEY ARE,

15:48.800 --> 15:52.536
OKAY, THAT'S ENOUGH OF THAT.
YOU COWS NEED TO DISPERSE?

15:52.538 --> 15:56.239

15:56.241 --> 15:57.307
BAD COWS!

15:57.309 --> 16:00.710

16:14.526 --> 16:16.426
I RECKON WE SHOULD
GET SOME HELP.

16:16.428 --> 16:18.028
I RECKON.

16:18.030 --> 16:19.663
DON'T BE NERVOUS, CARTMAN,
THIS IS GONNA BE CAKE!

16:19.665 --> 16:22.165
YEAH, AND THEN THOSE TERRANCE
AND PHILLIP DOLLS WILL BE OURS.

16:22.167 --> 16:23.800

16:45.991 --> 16:47.557
DUDE, I'M HAVING
SECOND THOUGHTS
ABOUT THIS.

16:47.559 --> 16:48.325
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:48.327 --> 16:49.426
I'M STARTING TO THINK
THAT MAYBE IT'S WRONG

16:49.428 --> 16:51.928
TO PUT SOMEONE WHO THINKS
THEY'RE A VIETNAMESE
PROSTITUTE ON A BULL.

16:51.930 --> 16:52.662
LET HER GO!

16:52.664 --> 16:54.698
AAAAARRRGGHH...

SUCKIE, SUCKIE!

16:55.934 --> 16:57.867
HANG ON, CARTMAN!

16:57.869 --> 17:01.237

CAME TO SOUTH PARK.

20:52.637 --> 20:53.837
WE'VE NEVER HEARD OF THEM.

20:53.839 --> 20:55.805
AAAHH, PHEEWW,

20:55.807 --> 20:58.241
ALTHOUGH I COULD'VE SWORE
THAT I HAD HEARD OF THEM

20:58.243 --> 21:00.710
