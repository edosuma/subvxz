WEBVTT

00:00.813 --> 00:02.407
Time for school.

00:06.207 --> 00:07.939
Morning, Baby Doll.

00:08.002 --> 00:09.802
What's the trash bag for?

00:09.870 --> 00:13.105
My ponies are my best friends
in the whole world.

00:13.174 --> 00:15.207
If there's a fire, they need to survive.

00:15.276 --> 00:17.243
Fire drill!

00:19.547 --> 00:21.013
<i>What's more troubling...</i>

00:21.082 --> 00:23.882
<i>the fact that plastic ponies
are her best friends,</i>

00:23.951 --> 00:25.417
<i>or that she's planning on letting</i>

00:25.486 --> 00:27.808
<i>the rest of us burn in our beds?</i>

00:31.058 --> 00:32.222
Come in!

00:32.247 --> 00:34.627
<i>Soon as they hit 12, you learn to knock.</i>

00:34.695 --> 00:36.895
<i>You learn the hard way.</i>

00:36.964 --> 00:38.931
Hey, Oliver.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.466
New shirt looks good.

00:40.534 --> 00:41.767
I can't be seen in this.

00:41.836 --> 00:42.868
What?

00:42.937 --> 00:44.403
You begged me to buy you
that polo shirt.

00:44.472 --> 00:46.405
Yes, but not from an outlet mall.

00:46.474 --> 00:48.707
What the hell difference
does it make where it's from?

00:48.776 --> 00:50.843
Outlet malls sell
the flawed reject shirts.

00:50.911 --> 00:53.812
Look at the cricket player.
Look at his bat.

00:53.881 --> 00:55.914
It's defective. The bat's bent.

00:55.983 --> 00:58.250
The bat's bent!

00:58.319 --> 00:59.451
So?

00:59.520 --> 01:01.353
Classic tell of a discount purchase.

01:01.422 --> 01:03.722
Oliver, it is not a big deal.

01:03.791 --> 01:06.458
Honestly, without any drama, for real,

01:06.527 --> 01:08.927
this is the worst thing
that's ever happened to anyone.

01:08.996 --> 01:10.429
Okay, well, guess what.

01:10.498 --> 01:13.132
I bought you the [bleep] shirt
so you're going to wear it!

01:13.200 --> 01:16.368
<i>There's two types of parents...
Ones who curse at their kids...</i>

01:16.437 --> 01:19.809
<i>and the ones who lie and say
they don't curse at their kids.</i>

01:27.882 --> 01:30.131
Taylor, why are you still in bed?!

01:32.678 --> 01:33.678
Ow!

01:38.225 --> 01:41.393
Greg, you can't possibly
still be in the bathroom.

01:41.462 --> 01:44.263
I was almost done,
but you just spooked it back in!

01:57.044 --> 01:58.143
Honey, could you stop doing that?

01:58.212 --> 01:59.545
I don't think I can, Daddy.

02:02.616 --> 02:05.117
I'd like to revisit
our earlier conversation.

02:05.186 --> 02:07.920
There's nothing wrong with
clothes from an outlet mall.

02:07.988 --> 02:09.621
That's where Mom bought me this sweater.

02:09.690 --> 02:11.423
It's cashmere.

02:11.492 --> 02:13.892
It's a blend, and it's going to pill.

02:15.663 --> 02:17.830
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

02:17.898 --> 02:20.332
I am not going to buy you a $90 shirt.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.641
If you want it that bad,
you can get an after-school job.

02:22.703 --> 02:23.802
- This is Westport.
- So?

02:23.871 --> 02:25.904
That's just not a thing
kids do around here.

02:25.973 --> 02:27.639
Cooper Bradford doesn't lift a finger

02:27.708 --> 02:28.941
and has his own credit card.

02:29.009 --> 02:30.242
I'm not asking for that.

02:30.311 --> 02:32.444
Greg, he's not asking
for his own credit card.

02:32.513 --> 02:34.680
That is an inspiring tale
of self-sacrifice.

02:34.749 --> 02:37.182
Hey, things are done
a certain way in this town.

02:37.251 --> 02:38.384
Don't you want me to fit in?

02:38.452 --> 02:40.352
No. I don't.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.154
I reject every message
that this town sends...

02:42.223 --> 02:44.256
that the car that you drive
or the clothes that you wear

02:44.325 --> 02:46.225
make you better than someone else.

02:46.293 --> 02:48.327
Who says you need money to be happy?

02:48.396 --> 02:49.628
I said it twice today already.

02:53.968 --> 02:56.168
You can't possibly be proud of that.

02:56.237 --> 02:58.270
- It has a plus in it.
- It also has a C in it.

02:58.339 --> 02:59.571
C's get degrees.

02:59.640 --> 03:00.973
No. C's get their parents

03:01.041 --> 03:03.108
to co-sign for their car loans
in their 40's.

03:03.177 --> 03:04.610
Don't worry about me.

03:04.678 --> 03:07.045
I'll get an athletic scholarship
to a mid-level junior college,

03:07.114 --> 03:08.380
marry well, play tennis.

03:08.449 --> 03:10.649
You can live in our guest house.
Not year round.

03:10.718 --> 03:12.785
I'll handle her. You take him.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.023
We'll let that one slip through
the cracks for the time being.

03:18.092 --> 03:21.226
You and I are gonna get
your math grade up.

03:21.295 --> 03:22.795
This is what I get for bragging.

03:22.863 --> 03:24.096
And if you want a new shirt,

03:24.165 --> 03:25.525
you can earn money by doing chores.

03:25.566 --> 03:27.599
Will do.

03:33.007 --> 03:35.247
Mnh-mnh. I know that smile.

03:35.325 --> 03:37.509
You cannot have Anna-Kat
do your work for you.

03:37.578 --> 03:40.412
What? It's good for her OCD.
Let a playa play.

03:40.481 --> 03:42.714
No chores, no shirt.

03:42.783 --> 03:45.384
I'm not getting invited to
Autumn Summers' birthday party.

03:45.453 --> 03:46.493
What makes you think that?

03:46.554 --> 03:47.920
Because since we moved here,

03:47.988 --> 03:51.028
I've never been invited
to anyone's birthday party.

03:51.192 --> 03:53.959
<i>Trying to raise these three kids</i>

03:54.028 --> 03:56.295
<i>to be normal in Westport
takes so much work.</i>

03:56.363 --> 03:58.397
<i>God, why'd I have to be so fertile?</i>

04:01.735 --> 04:03.435
Put your books down.

04:03.504 --> 04:07.172
People are gonna think
that you've got boobs coming in.

04:07.241 --> 04:09.341
Which one is Autumn Summers?

04:09.410 --> 04:10.876
Purple bow.

04:10.945 --> 04:13.512
Ohh. She's the one
who dresses like her mom.

04:13.581 --> 04:15.447
- Hi!
- Hi!

04:16.617 --> 04:17.950
Autumn and I jogged here this morning.

04:18.017 --> 04:19.184
Ugh!

04:19.253 --> 04:21.086
I should, too. I'm getting so chubby.

04:21.125 --> 04:24.189
- Ugh!
- No, I'm getting so chubby.

04:24.258 --> 04:25.958
Ugh!

04:26.026 --> 04:27.559
<i>Yep, that one go away from me.</i>

04:28.162 --> 04:29.561
Hey!

04:29.630 --> 04:31.029
Meat is murder.

04:31.098 --> 04:32.798
Now, go cry to your mother,
you little murderer!

04:32.867 --> 04:35.667
<i>So, no hot dogs at that birthday party.</i>

04:35.736 --> 04:37.069
Don't worry, Sweetie.

04:37.137 --> 04:39.371
I'll get you invited to that party.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.273
Really? You promise?

04:41.342 --> 04:43.742
Mm-hmm. Pony pinky promise.

04:45.000 --> 04:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:52.126 --> 04:53.685
<i>If Anna-Kat's going to fit in,</i>

04:53.754 --> 04:55.821
<i>she'll have to be a little less weird.</i>

04:55.890 --> 04:58.490
<i>When you say it in your head,
you don't have to say "unique."</i>

04:58.559 --> 05:01.326
I want her to have friends.
Lots of friends.

05:01.395 --> 05:03.228
Not plastic ponies.

05:03.297 --> 05:06.298
I'm not even hungry.
That's how upset I am.

05:06.367 --> 05:07.966
I'm still eating it.

05:08.035 --> 05:09.035
Isn't there a rule

05:09.103 --> 05:10.623
where everyone in the class is invited?

05:10.671 --> 05:11.937
- Mnh-mnh.
- They don't do that here.

05:12.006 --> 05:13.906
Kids are taught to feel like garbage

05:13.974 --> 05:16.308
at a much younger age in Westport.

05:16.377 --> 05:18.810
I have to figure out a way
for her to fit in better.

05:20.314 --> 05:23.782
It might also help
if you could fit in better, too.

05:23.851 --> 05:26.485
You think I'm the reason
that she's not getting invited?

05:26.554 --> 05:28.754
Well, it's not the kids
who send out the Evites, Katie.

05:28.822 --> 05:30.155
- It's the moms.
- Yeah.

05:30.224 --> 05:31.557
And at the parties,
the kids hang out with the kids

05:31.625 --> 05:33.258
and the moms hang out with the moms.

05:33.327 --> 05:35.160
And the moms know you can't stand them.

05:35.229 --> 05:37.258
Mm. Katie, they like you about as much

05:37.312 --> 05:39.097
as a Catholic priest likes a tattletale.

05:40.204 --> 05:41.867
You guys don't like them, either.

05:41.936 --> 05:43.156
But they don't know
that I don't like them.

05:43.181 --> 05:44.870
- I don't let on.
- And I do?

05:44.939 --> 05:46.838
- Katie, we love you.
- Like a sister.

05:46.907 --> 05:48.707
Your sister opened
six credit cards in your name

05:48.732 --> 05:49.641
and fled to Honduras.

05:49.710 --> 05:51.243
Not specifically my sister.

05:51.312 --> 05:53.845
Whenever you're on a mommy e-mail chain,

05:53.914 --> 05:57.259
you always reply,
"Really, guys?" or "Not it!"

05:57.284 --> 05:58.150
Yep.

05:58.218 --> 06:01.153
So to get Anna-Kat invited,
I have to fake liking them?

06:01.221 --> 06:02.654
- Yes.
- No.

06:02.723 --> 06:04.423
I'm not selling out to this town.

06:04.491 --> 06:06.191
Listen, if these women were drowning,

06:06.260 --> 06:07.893
I wouldn't throw them a life jacket.

06:07.962 --> 06:09.061
I mean, of course they'd be fine

06:09.129 --> 06:10.028
because fake boobies float.

06:10.097 --> 06:11.530
But the point is,

06:11.599 --> 06:14.066
I play the game
so that my kids get invited.

06:14.134 --> 06:16.034
If you want Anna-Kat
to go to these parties,

06:16.103 --> 06:17.469
you're gonna have to suck it up

06:17.538 --> 06:19.746
and play with the Westport moms.

06:19.771 --> 06:21.039
Yep.

06:21.108 --> 06:23.609
If I have to, I will.

06:23.677 --> 06:25.243
Ugh. I just lost my appetite.

06:25.312 --> 06:26.745
- Great.
- I'm still eating it.

06:26.814 --> 06:27.814
Damn it.

06:32.227 --> 06:35.262
Are you starting to get
the cleaning tingles?

06:35.330 --> 06:37.864
I love the cleaning tingles.

06:37.933 --> 06:39.799
And to determine the vector, you...?

06:39.868 --> 06:41.375
I don't remember.

06:41.436 --> 06:42.869
You don't remember or you're not trying?

06:42.938 --> 06:44.938
Both.

06:45.007 --> 06:49.643
Okay, dinner tonight
is last night's, plus Cheetos.

06:49.711 --> 06:51.711
Where are you going, Mama?

06:51.780 --> 06:53.546
To get you invited to that party.

06:53.615 --> 06:55.515
A real birthday party?

06:55.584 --> 06:57.751
- Yeah.
- It's finally happening!

07:01.623 --> 07:03.636
Here's the intel on Tara Summers...

07:03.691 --> 07:06.266
dresses like her kid, yoga body,
and is a militant vegetarian.

07:06.291 --> 07:08.311
- Not even bacon.
- No vegetarian eats bacon.

07:08.380 --> 07:10.046
Some make an exception,
like in a Cobb salad.

07:10.115 --> 07:11.781
- No.
- I don't have time to argue.

07:11.850 --> 07:13.083
I have to hit the Pressed Juice Bar

07:13.151 --> 07:15.385
right when the 4:00 yoga class
is letting out.

07:15.454 --> 07:17.921
Do I look like a Westport mom?

07:17.990 --> 07:20.490
You're wearing black
baked potatoes on your feet.

07:20.559 --> 07:22.759
They're clogs.
They're perfectly acceptable.

07:22.828 --> 07:24.327
If you work in a vet's office.

07:24.396 --> 07:26.162
To be clear, you're selling out
your beliefs

07:26.231 --> 07:27.416
to befriend a woman you can't stand

07:27.441 --> 07:29.766
to get Anna-Kat invited to a party
with girls you don't approve of?

07:29.835 --> 07:32.235
No one wants to have sex with
a sarcastic summarizer, Greg.

07:35.574 --> 07:38.742
It's a different lesson.
Okay, here we go.

07:42.848 --> 07:45.482
Hi, everyone.

07:45.550 --> 07:47.317
Hi!

07:47.386 --> 07:50.353
I'm Katie.
Our girls are in the same class?

07:50.422 --> 07:52.989
Yes, I see you
at drop off... staring at me.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.357
Because I love your outfits.

07:54.426 --> 07:56.826
I want to start dressing
like a 7-year old, too.

07:56.895 --> 07:59.229
<i>Came out wrong, but
I'm just gonna plow forward.</i>

07:59.297 --> 08:00.964
You do yoga?

08:01.033 --> 08:05.001
I have decided that it's time
to embrace a healthy lifestyle.

08:05.070 --> 08:06.836
I just want to immerse myself

08:06.905 --> 08:09.172
in all that this community has to offer.

08:09.241 --> 08:12.008
- Oh.
- That is so great!

08:12.077 --> 08:14.110
I know!

08:14.179 --> 08:15.578
Any pointers for me?

08:15.647 --> 08:17.147
I've got an aesthetician for you.

08:17.215 --> 08:19.349
- You need a personal trainer.
- And a personal shopper.

08:19.418 --> 08:20.684
Can't say for certain,

08:20.752 --> 08:21.751
but I have a feeling
you'll need my waxer.

08:21.820 --> 08:22.852
Mm-hmm.

08:22.921 --> 08:24.387
Thanks, you guys.

08:24.456 --> 08:26.656
<i>They will never know how close
they just came to death.</i>

08:26.725 --> 08:29.759
<i>Eye on the prize...
invitation for Anna-Kat.</i>

08:29.828 --> 08:32.529
I am really interested
in becoming a vegetarian.

08:32.597 --> 08:34.798
- Oh!
- Wonderful.

08:34.866 --> 08:38.301
With you becoming a vegetarian,
we're gonna save so many animals.

08:38.370 --> 08:39.836
- Oh, yes.
- Yes.

08:39.905 --> 08:41.090
Oh!

08:41.115 --> 08:43.395
Yoga's starting. Let's head back in.

08:44.009 --> 08:46.276
Come on, Katie!

08:46.344 --> 08:48.078
I thought class was over.

08:48.146 --> 08:50.480
Oh, that's the 4:00.
We're also doing the 5:30.

08:50.549 --> 08:51.549
Ugh!

08:51.583 --> 08:52.782
Yeah!

08:52.851 --> 08:54.895
Ugh, yeah!

08:55.253 --> 09:00.190
<i>I wouldn't do this for Greg,
for Oliver, or for Taylor...</i>

09:02.194 --> 09:05.161
<i>...but for Anna-Kat, I'll do anything.</i>

09:05.230 --> 09:06.796
Hi!

09:06.865 --> 09:10.400
<i>Does having a favorite
make me a bad mom?</i>

09:10.469 --> 09:12.202
<i>I don't care.</i>

09:12.270 --> 09:13.903
<i>That makes me a bad mom.</i>

09:13.972 --> 09:16.272
What's the definition
of the perfect square?

09:16.341 --> 09:17.974
You.

09:18.043 --> 09:19.342
Good burn. Wrong answer.

09:19.411 --> 09:22.378
Taylor, come on.
We've been at this for a week.

09:22.447 --> 09:24.347
Dad, just face it,
I don't get this stuff.

09:24.416 --> 09:26.750
There is no not getting it.
There's just not trying.

09:26.818 --> 09:29.052
Really, Dad? Quoting Yoda?

09:31.123 --> 09:35.759
That's "Do or do not. There is no try."

09:37.996 --> 09:39.295
Come with me, Nerd.

09:39.364 --> 09:41.564
Just because I know "Star Wars"
doesn't make me a...

09:41.633 --> 09:43.099
All right, I'll go.

09:46.872 --> 09:49.506
See? I get this. Sports.

09:49.574 --> 09:51.014
Taylor, there's more to life than...

09:51.042 --> 09:52.809
Your turn.

09:52.878 --> 09:55.078
This ball seems huge. Is it regulation?

09:56.114 --> 09:57.547
Okay. I got this.

10:00.519 --> 10:02.952
I got it. Totally... I'm all in.

10:05.557 --> 10:07.891
See? You're not good at sports.

10:07.959 --> 10:09.025
I'm not good at school.

10:09.094 --> 10:10.527
It's just not who I am,

10:10.595 --> 10:13.429
like being normally coordinated
is just not who you are.

10:13.498 --> 10:16.866
I wish my parents had pushed me
to be better at sports.

10:16.935 --> 10:19.402
They coddled me,
and they let me quit too easily.

10:19.471 --> 10:21.738
I wish I could talk business
on the links

10:21.807 --> 10:23.473
or play a pick-up game with the guys.

10:23.542 --> 10:24.641
What guys?

10:24.709 --> 10:26.910
You know, the guys. My guys.

10:28.113 --> 10:29.379
All right, I have no guys.

10:29.447 --> 10:31.948
But the point is, I take
no pride in being a bad athlete.

10:32.017 --> 10:34.117
You shouldn't take pride
in being a bad student.

10:34.186 --> 10:35.919
But I'm perfectly happy with my grades.

10:35.987 --> 10:37.053
You should be, too.

10:38.957 --> 10:41.491
Look, Taylor, I'm not giving up.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.960
Wha...

10:44.029 --> 10:46.396
Greg Otto down by two.

10:46.464 --> 10:50.033
Seconds on the clock. He shoots and...

10:50.101 --> 10:53.169
- Run!
- We live here.

11:00.979 --> 11:02.178
Yoga.

11:02.247 --> 11:03.479
Hi, Mama.

11:03.548 --> 11:05.448
Hey, Honey.
Is that the card for the party?

11:05.517 --> 11:07.584
That's a lot of glitter.

11:07.652 --> 11:09.886
Daddy says it looks like
a stripper sneezed on it.

11:09.955 --> 11:12.755
In my defense,
I didn't think she heard me.

11:12.824 --> 11:15.692
So, how'd it got with
the Real Housewives of Westport?

11:15.760 --> 11:18.595
After spending some time
around these women,

11:18.663 --> 11:20.496
I'm starting to feel
some sympathy for them.

11:20.565 --> 11:21.731
Get this.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.133
They have never been
to the Olive Garden.

11:26.204 --> 11:29.973
Doris says the Evites went out.
Lindsay Coolidge just got hers.

11:31.409 --> 11:34.377
Mine should just be right...

11:34.446 --> 11:37.347
Hm.

11:37.415 --> 11:39.215
It's just gonna take a second.

11:39.284 --> 11:40.783
I'll just refresh.

11:42.487 --> 11:43.887
Is there a problem, Mama?

11:43.955 --> 11:46.022
No, Sweetie. Mnh-mnh.

11:46.892 --> 11:49.125
Refresh. Refresh.

11:49.194 --> 11:50.593
Refresh.

11:50.662 --> 11:53.022
Hey, Sweetie, why don't you
finish your card upstairs, okay?

11:53.064 --> 11:54.964
- Okay, Daddy.
- Good girl.

11:57.102 --> 11:58.668
Maybe it's just taking
a little bit longer.

11:58.737 --> 12:00.970
- Don't all Evites go out at once?
- I don't know!

12:01.039 --> 12:02.572
I didn't build the Internet, Greg!

12:10.482 --> 12:12.448
I didn't get invited.

12:12.517 --> 12:13.811
Anna-Kat didn't get invited.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.752
Yes, Anna-Kat. That's what I meant.

12:15.820 --> 12:17.382
I can't believe
all the things that I did

12:17.444 --> 12:18.788
to fit in with those idiots.

12:18.857 --> 12:20.990
I'm growing back
everything that I waxed.

12:21.059 --> 12:22.889
Well, I got two weeks.

12:22.994 --> 12:24.160
Yeah.

12:27.925 --> 12:29.358
I don't understand it!

12:29.427 --> 12:31.501
All week long, I was friendly Katie.

12:31.526 --> 12:32.697
Perky Katie.

12:32.722 --> 12:34.876
The kind of Katie
who charmed your entire family.

12:34.901 --> 12:37.115
I was rehearsal-dinner Katie.

12:37.168 --> 12:38.267
Whoa.

12:38.336 --> 12:40.002
Maybe the move to Westport
was a bad idea.

12:40.071 --> 12:42.204
I'm an outcast. Anna-Kat's an outcast.

12:42.273 --> 12:43.839
And Oliver's becoming a douche.

12:43.908 --> 12:44.940
Katie.

12:45.009 --> 12:46.875
And Taylor's goal in life
is to marry rich

12:46.944 --> 12:49.144
and drink those stupid
pressed juices all day.

12:49.213 --> 12:51.614
Yeah. Maybe moving to Westport
was a bad idea.

12:51.682 --> 12:53.616
What are you doing?

12:53.684 --> 12:54.817
What?

12:54.885 --> 12:56.418
Don't agree with me. I'm spiraling.

12:56.487 --> 12:58.180
You're job is to say
that we did the right thing.

12:58.227 --> 13:00.222
That is Greg and Katie 101, man.

13:00.291 --> 13:02.658
Listen, I'm sorry that Anna-Kat
wasn't invited to the party,

13:02.727 --> 13:04.167
but you shouldn't have promised her.

13:04.228 --> 13:05.527
Now we have to go tell her.

13:05.596 --> 13:07.162
It's gonna break her little heart.

13:07.231 --> 13:09.698
- Where are you going?
- To rake the leaves.

13:09.767 --> 13:12.034
- It's nighttime.
- Yeah, I realize that.

13:12.103 --> 13:13.235
This way, nobody sees me,

13:13.304 --> 13:14.970
and I won't have to suffer
the humiliation

13:15.039 --> 13:17.673
of being the only kid in town
who does yard work.

13:18.976 --> 13:20.376
See?

13:20.444 --> 13:23.045
- He's a douche.
- Yeah.

13:23.114 --> 13:25.781
I like your fur. It's very shiny.

13:25.850 --> 13:28.376
Uh-oh. Both parents. That's never good.

13:28.469 --> 13:33.305
Honey, there's a problem with the party.

13:33.374 --> 13:34.473
But you promised!

13:34.542 --> 13:36.775
And I made a birthday card
and everything.

13:36.844 --> 13:39.178
Sweetie, a lot of times
with the kids' birthday parties,

13:39.246 --> 13:40.679
they can't invite the whole class.

13:40.748 --> 13:42.514
It's expensive,
and there isn't enough room.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.684
Autumn's parents are renting out
the whole aquarium.

13:45.753 --> 13:48.153
Okay, that's a piece
of information I was missing,

13:48.222 --> 13:49.455
and it changes things.

13:49.523 --> 13:52.291
You know what I did when
Jay Zambelli didn't invite me

13:52.360 --> 13:54.226
to his birthday party at Six Flags?

13:54.295 --> 13:56.695
- What, Daddy?
- I had the best day.

13:56.764 --> 13:58.998
My parents took me to the aquar... ium.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.067
Katie, anything?

14:02.136 --> 14:04.136
<i>This couldn't be sadder.</i>

14:04.205 --> 14:06.572
Will you guys have a party with me?

14:06.641 --> 14:08.707
<i>That made it sadder.</i>

14:11.345 --> 14:15.014
<i>Just a couple of lonely girls
having a pony pity party.</i>

14:15.082 --> 14:16.082
- Hey!
- Hey.

14:16.263 --> 14:18.317
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:18.386 --> 14:21.186
What are you guys doing here?

14:21.255 --> 14:23.088
Greg called us.
He told us what happened.

14:23.157 --> 14:25.090
Entenmann's Louisiana crunch cake.

14:25.159 --> 14:26.258
And if that doesn't work,

14:26.327 --> 14:28.827
I'll stop by Carvel
and get a Cookie Puss.

14:28.896 --> 14:32.031
All right, Anna-Kat,
let's get you up to bed.

14:32.099 --> 14:33.265
You okay, Sweetie?

14:33.334 --> 14:34.967
Yeah. I guess. You?

14:35.036 --> 14:37.536
I'll be all right.

14:37.605 --> 14:40.072
I know what'll cheer you up.

14:40.141 --> 14:42.174
We'll YouTube some videos
of the Hindenburg.

14:42.243 --> 14:43.609
36 fatalities...

14:43.678 --> 14:47.613
13 passengers, 22 crewman,
and one on the ground.

14:47.682 --> 14:49.982
Okay.

14:51.952 --> 14:54.687
How cute are those little legs?

14:54.755 --> 14:57.456
How could anyone not want
those legs at a party?

14:57.525 --> 14:59.158
Or mine for that matter?

14:59.226 --> 15:01.627
So, what happened?

15:01.696 --> 15:04.363
I don't know where I went wrong.

15:04.432 --> 15:06.098
Hi!

15:06.167 --> 15:07.766
- Nailed it, right?
- Dead on.

15:07.835 --> 15:09.735
Actually felt my sphincter
clench with rage.

15:09.804 --> 15:11.770
Katie, come on.

15:11.839 --> 15:13.605
You really want to be friends
with those women?

15:13.674 --> 15:14.907
Of course not.

15:14.975 --> 15:17.176
But I want them
to want to be friends with me.

15:17.244 --> 15:18.844
Up until now, I've been rejecting them.

15:18.913 --> 15:20.245
I just assumed

15:20.314 --> 15:21.680
that they would want me
to be a part of their group

15:21.749 --> 15:23.382
if I gave them the chance.

15:23.451 --> 15:24.817
Now I put myself out there,

15:24.885 --> 15:26.819
and I'm back in high school
dealing with Holly Platt.

15:26.887 --> 15:27.720
- Aw.
- Mm.

15:27.788 --> 15:29.288
- She iced you out?
- No.

15:29.356 --> 15:32.024
Other way around.
I was super cool in high school.

15:32.093 --> 15:34.993
But for the first time,
I know how she felt.

15:35.062 --> 15:37.996
If I had a time machine,
I'd go back and apologize.

15:38.065 --> 15:39.695
You could just find her
on Facebook and apologize.

15:39.734 --> 15:41.967
Ugh! But then I'd have to log in,

15:42.036 --> 15:43.836
and it would just...

15:43.904 --> 15:45.804
I just swept. You guys are
getting crumbs everywhere.

15:45.873 --> 15:47.673
Oh! Oh, what's that?

15:47.742 --> 15:51.210
Oh, I'm sorry. Oh.
I can't hear you, Oliver

15:51.278 --> 15:52.845
Grow up, Doris.

15:55.416 --> 15:58.350
I love messing with that kid.

15:58.419 --> 16:01.120
I'm such a bully. It's super unhealthy.

16:01.188 --> 16:03.655
We cannot let Tara Summers
get away with this.

16:03.724 --> 16:05.858
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

16:05.926 --> 16:07.726
Remember that Mel Gibson movie,
"The Patriot"?

16:07.762 --> 16:08.894
When they gathered the townspeople,

16:08.963 --> 16:10.963
locked them in the church,
and then burned it to the ground?

16:11.031 --> 16:12.431
Go on.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.434
I'm going to do that to those
moms at the Pressed Juice Bar.

16:15.503 --> 16:17.143
Okay. Well,
you're gonna have to volunteer

16:17.204 --> 16:19.138
a whole lot more at school
if all those moms are dead.

16:19.206 --> 16:22.775
Fine. Then you come up with something.

16:22.843 --> 16:26.145
Actually, I think
I know what might work.

16:28.549 --> 16:30.149
<i>Tara Summers' house,</i>

16:30.217 --> 16:32.742
<i>home of Westport's meanest vegetarian.</i>

16:32.920 --> 16:35.320
<i>We're not egging her house
or T.P.ing it.</i>

16:35.389 --> 16:36.855
<i>We are above that.</i>

16:38.363 --> 16:41.057
<i>But we are not above raising
old meat on her flagpole.</i>

16:41.082 --> 16:42.175
Yeah!

16:42.200 --> 16:43.979
<i>That's wasn't meant to sound dirty.</i>

16:44.048 --> 16:45.647
It's the perfect revenge.

16:45.716 --> 16:47.750
Vandalism makes me feel so much better.

16:47.818 --> 16:49.151
I love you guys.

16:49.220 --> 16:51.820
- No one messes with our Katie.
- Amen.

16:51.889 --> 16:53.300
<i>To survive in Westport,</i>

16:53.363 --> 16:56.525
<i>I found out all you really need
are two good friends.</i>

16:56.594 --> 16:58.260
<i>Some say you need just one.</i>

16:58.329 --> 17:00.662
<i>I like two just in case
one of them dies.</i>

17:01.866 --> 17:03.499
Run for it! Go! Go!

17:03.567 --> 17:06.935
Is that how you run?
I've never seen you run before!

17:07.003 --> 17:08.670
You don't look so great, either!

17:08.739 --> 17:11.874
<i>Hanging with Doris
and Angela gave me an idea.</i>

17:11.942 --> 17:13.709
<i>I found out that, for whatever reason,</i>

17:13.778 --> 17:16.377
<i>two other girls were also
not invited to Autumn's party.</i>

17:16.446 --> 17:18.480
<i>Anna-Kat doesn't need 100 friends.</i>

17:18.549 --> 17:20.482
<i>Two is plenty.</i>

17:20.550 --> 17:24.219
<i>Maybe Rajni and Eyeball Shirt
will be her partners in crime.</i>

17:28.125 --> 17:31.226
Hey, Taylor. This is Ashley and Lavi.

17:31.295 --> 17:32.767
- Hi.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

17:32.792 --> 17:33.729
So pretty.

17:33.798 --> 17:35.063
Thank you.

17:35.132 --> 17:37.466
Oh, and quite the student.
Check out this math test.

17:37.535 --> 17:40.035
She got a C-minus.

17:40.104 --> 17:43.172
- I'm sure she...
- Dad, what are you doing?

17:43.240 --> 17:45.484
Well, you said I should be fine with
your grades, so I'm being fine.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.020
I'm so proud of my average daughter.

17:50.981 --> 17:52.247
Looking sharp.

17:52.316 --> 17:55.336
Polo shirt purchased
at Ed Mitchell's at full price.

17:55.402 --> 17:58.704
See, Scoobs, you appreciate it more
when you work hard for it.

17:58.772 --> 18:00.572
You're so right, Mom.

18:02.309 --> 18:03.876
Cleaning out the closets?

18:03.944 --> 18:06.245
Yes.

18:06.313 --> 18:08.280
Me too. Did you get a thank you?

18:08.349 --> 18:09.848
No.

18:09.917 --> 18:12.184
- No one appreciates us.
- Mm-hmm.

18:12.253 --> 18:14.553
- Oliver.
- Luz.

18:14.622 --> 18:16.355
Throwing away a good shirt?

18:16.423 --> 18:19.591
It's not good. See?

18:19.660 --> 18:21.326
The bat is askew.

18:22.549 --> 18:25.774
I can re-stitch this in two minutes,
make it good as new.

18:25.799 --> 18:27.399
- You can?
- Mm-hmm.

18:27.468 --> 18:30.135
If I bought a whole bunch
of these defective shirts,

18:30.204 --> 18:31.637
would you fix them for me?

18:31.705 --> 18:34.206
Why? So you can resell them
to kids for a profit?

18:34.275 --> 18:38.377
Luz, we could be partners. 70-30.

18:38.445 --> 18:40.746
Don't mess with me, boy.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.347
50-50.

18:46.020 --> 18:48.553
Why are you doing your evil smile?

18:48.622 --> 18:50.768
This is my everyday adorable smile.

18:53.207 --> 18:55.250
<i>Maybe I jumped the gun about Westport.</i>

18:55.319 --> 18:58.055
<i>Things are looking up
for the Otto family.</i>

18:58.648 --> 19:02.267
<i>Oliver has learned a little something
about having a work ethic.</i>

19:02.336 --> 19:04.069
<i>And Taylor realizes</i>

19:04.138 --> 19:07.539
<i>that C's are not something
to be proud of.</i>

19:12.279 --> 19:14.680
<i>And Anna-Kat...</i>

19:14.748 --> 19:17.049
<i>...just might have two good friends.</i>

19:18.775 --> 19:21.009
<i>Or maybe just one good friend.</i>

19:30.266 --> 19:31.932
Did you have fun today?

19:32.001 --> 19:34.368
It wasn't the aquarium, but it was fun.

19:34.436 --> 19:35.936
Hey, forget about the aquarium.

19:36.005 --> 19:37.838
We're gonna do
something great ourselves.

19:37.907 --> 19:40.741
How about we take you to the Disney...

19:40.810 --> 19:43.043
- World!
- Disney World!

19:44.213 --> 19:46.647
Hey, guys, we're going to Disney World!

19:46.715 --> 19:49.149
Store.

19:49.218 --> 19:51.618
I was going to say,
"Take you to the Disney Store."

19:51.687 --> 19:54.214
I know. But you saw her face.
What was I supposed to do?

19:54.239 --> 19:56.309
I don't know.
Maybe let me finish my sentence?

19:56.374 --> 19:57.942
We can't afford to go to Disney World.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.770
Now we have to disappoint her
all over again.

20:02.965 --> 20:04.998
Honey, we're not going to Disney World.

20:05.067 --> 20:07.100
It's closed.

20:07.169 --> 20:10.771
Mr. Toad... evidently...

20:10.839 --> 20:12.739
went wild, and...

20:12.808 --> 20:14.441
- Oh.
- Yeah.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.243
I am so sorry.

20:16.312 --> 20:17.674
How about we take you to see...

20:17.729 --> 20:21.548
- World!
- Oh, my God! SeaWorld!

20:21.617 --> 20:24.351
Hey, guys, we're going to SeaWorld!

20:24.420 --> 20:26.153
I was gonna say,
"Take you to see a movie."

20:26.221 --> 20:28.221
This is why I'm her favorite parent.
