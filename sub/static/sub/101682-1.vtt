01:39.933 --> 01:42.311
{\an8}Good evening, sir. This way.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.107
{\an8}Champagne?

02:04.208 --> 02:06.084
{\an8}Aw. Look!

02:11.590 --> 02:13.884
Bob! Gorgeous.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.928
- Yes. Isn't he adorable?
- Ooh.

02:16.178 --> 02:17.513
Look at that.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.770
Oh! Bob the cat!

02:25.395 --> 02:27.189
Look at that.

02:29.024 --> 02:29.775
There he is.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.944
There's great demand
for his work right now.

02:33.904 --> 02:37.324
This way!
Thank you, sir. Perfect.

02:52.548 --> 02:54.675
Can I have everybody's attention,
please?

02:55.551 --> 02:56.677
Thank you.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.597
Welcome, everybody, to our
annual authors' Christmas party.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.141
Hear, hear.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.643
Hear, hear.

03:05.394 --> 03:08.647
Some of you are familiar faces
and some of you are new,

03:08.689 --> 03:11.692
and it is such a pleasure
to see all of you here today.

03:11.733 --> 03:13.360
It's going to be a tremendous evening,

03:13.402 --> 03:15.279
- with some fabulous speakers.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, mate.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.114
But I would first like to welcome...

03:17.155 --> 03:19.366
- Here you are, Bob. Shh.
- ...one of our new authors,

03:19.408 --> 03:22.244
James Bowen, and his companion, Bob.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.666
Well done. There you go.

03:29.793 --> 03:33.213
The story of how these two lost souls
met and saved each other

03:33.255 --> 03:35.048
here on the streets of London

03:35.424 --> 03:38.135
has touched readers
from all over the world.

03:38.177 --> 03:40.179
And we are delighted to announce

03:40.220 --> 03:43.807
that James is hard at work on
his new book about their adventures.

03:43.849 --> 03:44.933
Aren't you, James?

03:45.601 --> 03:48.270
Which we cannot wait to publish
next August.

03:55.194 --> 03:56.904
What are we doing here, mate?

03:59.198 --> 04:03.744
So, erm, Mr Bowen, what does
the big day hold in store for you?

04:03.785 --> 04:06.413
Oh, you know,
turkey with the trimmings, I guess,

04:06.455 --> 04:07.539
in front of the TV.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.124
Pigs in blankets for him.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.084
So, nothing special, then?

04:11.126 --> 04:13.337
Oh, that's pretty special for us.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.255
Of course. I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.634
Can I say hello to Bob?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.552
Oh, Jacqueline Wilson.

04:20.969 --> 04:22.304
Hello, Jacqueline.

04:22.346 --> 04:23.680
- Hi.
- Yeah, of course.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.099
Thank you. Hello, Bob.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.561
- Love your books.
- Oh. That's so nice.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.939
Not Bob, obviously. Can't read.

04:31.980 --> 04:33.649
But, erm, yeah.

04:33.690 --> 04:36.443
I see you're sneaking away.
I don't blame you.

04:36.485 --> 04:38.445
Such a posh invite. Couldn't say no.

04:38.487 --> 04:42.157
I know. Congratulations, though,
on your new book.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.993
Or should I say commiserations?

04:45.035 --> 04:48.121
- I recognised the look on your face.
- You did?

04:48.163 --> 04:50.123
You haven't started it yet, have you?

04:50.165 --> 04:53.961
Not yet, no.
I can't, erm, settle on a story.

04:54.002 --> 04:58.632
I know the feeling.
I'm sure you'll get an idea soon.

04:58.674 --> 05:01.343
They often happen
when you least expect it.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.971
So, good luck with it, anyway.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.681
Thank you. Lovely to meet you.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.974
And you too.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.692
Aw, Merry Christmas, Jay!

05:17.526 --> 05:20.195
Come and get your mulled wine.

05:26.493 --> 05:27.786
Nice cat, mate.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.166
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.269
Ready, ladies and gentlemen?
Here we go.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.479
That's it. Like that.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.815
Can you believe this man?

05:56.857 --> 05:58.567
Merry Christmas.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.486
- Get off!
- Get his legs!

06:01.528 --> 06:03.947
- I haven't done anything. Get off me.
- You're causing a scene.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.491
- Hold him down.
- Get off me.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.951
I haven't done anything.
You're hurting me. Get off.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.286
You're causing a scene,
all right? Stay down.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.329
- Stay down.
- I haven't done anything.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.914
Stay down.
Or you're gonna hurt yourself.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.791
- Hey! Hey! What's going on?
- Hold him. Hold...

06:14.833 --> 06:16.043
Why are you holding
him down on the ground like this?

06:16.084 --> 06:18.086
Does it need three of you, really?

06:18.128 --> 06:21.632
Well, well, well. If it isn't cat boy.

06:22.049 --> 06:24.301
- Long time no see.
- It's you.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.470
Still your old charming self, I see.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.347
Tell you what,
you can sling your hook right away.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.848
All right,
what's going on?

06:29.890 --> 06:31.934
Just standard stuff, really, love.

06:31.975 --> 06:35.145
Er, illegal busker. Got a bit punchy,
but we calmed him down.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.523
- What's wrong with you?
- Excuse me, Officer.

06:37.564 --> 06:40.192
- I thought I told you to piss off.
- Do you know this person?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.152
No, but I'm pretty sure
he wasn't breaking the law.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.363
Yeah, he was busking over there,
in Camden,

06:44.404 --> 06:45.697
not there
in the Borough of Westminster.

06:45.739 --> 06:46.740
And?

06:47.241 --> 06:48.951
And you need a permit
to busk in Westminster.

06:48.992 --> 06:51.078
- You don't need one in Camden.
- Oh.

06:51.119 --> 06:53.830
- All right, phone it in.
- Look, this is stupid.

06:53.872 --> 06:56.208
Can we just charge this guy
and then we can all go home?

06:56.250 --> 06:57.584
Charge him with what?
Playing his guitar?

06:57.626 --> 06:59.169
You knew he was legal, didn't you?

06:59.211 --> 07:00.295
<i>Control.
That's confirmed.</i>

07:00.337 --> 07:01.547
He's right. Let him go.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.590
Let, let him go? Let him go?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.052
- It's unbelievable.
- That's assault.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.888
- I wanna press charges.
- Walk away. Just walk away. Trust me.

07:09.930 --> 07:10.973
Calm down.
He hasn't done anything wrong.

07:11.014 --> 07:13.350
- But he's getting away.
- I said calm down.

07:19.231 --> 07:22.526
So what's the story?
Are you Harry Potter's lawyer?

07:22.568 --> 07:25.279
- Excuse me? Mm.
- All that legal stuff.

07:25.320 --> 07:27.823
Borough of this and that,
and a magic cat on your shoulder.

07:27.865 --> 07:29.783
Let's just say
I'm familiar with the law.

07:31.660 --> 07:32.661
It's a pretty chill cat.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.205
Most of the time.

07:35.998 --> 07:37.082
Yeah.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.251
Saw him giving the eye
to that dickhead back there.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.545
- Yeah.
- He knows you, doesn't he?

07:41.587 --> 07:43.797
Yeah. Ghost of Christmas Past.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.425
Him and Bob and me
have a bit of history.

07:47.342 --> 07:48.343
Bob.

07:50.596 --> 07:52.014
That's one house burger.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.684
- Can I get the bill, please?
- Yes, right away.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.227
- And a saucer?
- Mm-hm.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.478
Thank you.

08:03.859 --> 08:05.527
They do serve
something resembling food

08:05.569 --> 08:06.904
at the Christmas shelters, you know.

08:07.196 --> 08:08.405
That obvious, eh?

08:09.239 --> 08:10.908
Haven't been to a shelter since this.

08:14.077 --> 08:17.122
Stanley knife. Sliced straight through
my sleeping bag.

08:18.332 --> 08:20.125
Lucky they only took my money belt.

08:20.876 --> 08:21.877
OK.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.090
Have you tried Monmouth Street?

08:27.508 --> 08:30.511
There's a warm air vent
above the kitchen to that hotel.

08:30.552 --> 08:32.513
You're one of them outreach workers.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.224
No. God squad?

08:35.265 --> 08:36.892
I used to be in the same boat as you.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.558
I was homeless too.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.229
I ended up on heroin.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.649
Junkies. Hate 'em.

08:44.274 --> 08:46.026
Not as much as they hate themselves.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.739
So how'd you get clean? Magic cat?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.617
He helped me get clean,

08:53.659 --> 08:55.536
learn a few lessons I needed to learn.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.080
Like that.

08:58.121 --> 09:00.415
Fall down seven times, get up eight.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.002
Except sometimes you can't.

09:04.962 --> 09:06.630
Cos you've got nothing to get up for.

09:07.381 --> 09:09.716
Cos you feel like you're nothing,
got nothing to give.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.969
- I know. I know.
- You don't know anything.

09:12.010 --> 09:15.389
I don't know why I came here.
Just so someone else can preach at me.

09:15.430 --> 09:18.183
That is all anyone does,
especially at this time of year.

09:19.768 --> 09:21.687
I should have just let them
bang me up over Christmas.

09:21.728 --> 09:24.064
Sit down, OK? Finish your food.

09:24.982 --> 09:28.318
All right. Just give me five minutes.
No preaching, cross my heart.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.195
Just a story.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.532
OK? Sit down.

09:34.658 --> 09:35.909
Five minutes.

09:39.955 --> 09:42.624
It was a few years ago.
After I got clean.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.502
The last Christmas
me and Bob worked on the streets.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.536
Yeah. Don't blame you, mate.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.000
Not even a please?

11:14.550 --> 11:17.010
Sorry, mate. Guess we're out.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.866
No. No, no, no. Oi, you.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.702
Stay there. Stay there, OK?

11:42.077 --> 11:43.370
Back before you know it.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.862
Don't let the elephants out.

12:17.738 --> 12:21.074
Ah. Where is my good friend Bob?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.869
He, er, sent me
to fetch his breakfast.

12:24.494 --> 12:27.706
Hmm. I told you he was
the wise one round here.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.419
What time do you close tonight?

12:32.461 --> 12:34.213
I've gotta top up
my electric after work.

12:34.463 --> 12:35.589
Er, 10:00.

12:36.131 --> 12:38.592
Got a late delivery. Christmas stock.

12:39.176 --> 12:40.761
Another week of that word.

12:41.762 --> 12:45.349
Hmm. Not exactly
my favourite time of year either.

12:49.895 --> 12:52.189
Oh.

12:52.523 --> 12:54.900
Oh, it's the anniversary.
I'm sorry, Moody.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.443
Ah, it's OK.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.154
Anyway,

12:59.988 --> 13:01.532
Christmas is all right.

13:02.241 --> 13:05.160
We have all to believe
in something. Hmm?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.913
Christmas. Krishna.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.625
Cricket.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.503
I suppose I'm Buddish.

13:15.170 --> 13:16.338
Buddish?

13:16.380 --> 13:19.675
Yeah, I sort of believe in Buddhism.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.802
Karma, all that kind of stuff.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.846
Ah, Karma.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.348
What goes around comes around.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.392
Like the poor butter maker.

13:28.934 --> 13:30.769
Why do I feel
one of your stories coming on?

13:30.811 --> 13:33.981
He was a farmer.

13:34.022 --> 13:36.066
His best customer was a shop owner

13:36.108 --> 13:39.361
who ordered one kilo of butter
every month.

13:39.695 --> 13:45.242
In return, he paid the farmer
flour, beans and...

13:48.829 --> 13:50.914
one kilo of sugar.

13:51.748 --> 13:52.791
OK.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.210
One day, the shop owner
weighed the butter,

13:55.252 --> 13:58.422
but it was only 900 grams, not a kilo.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.257
Ooh, he got very angry.

14:00.299 --> 14:02.634
"I am going to call
the police on you."

14:04.219 --> 14:05.804
The farmer, he was polite.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.056
He said he was a poor man,

14:08.098 --> 14:10.017
couldn't afford to buy the weights
for his scales,

14:10.058 --> 14:13.020
so he measured the butter
with the only weight he had.

14:14.897 --> 14:15.981
The kilo of sugar.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.524
Exactly.

14:18.942 --> 14:21.904
Do good, it will be repaid.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.281
- Do bad...
- Less butter on your bread.

14:27.868 --> 14:28.827
Here.

14:30.204 --> 14:31.830
- For Bob.
- Aww.

14:31.872 --> 14:33.081
Merry Krishna.

14:33.457 --> 14:34.458
Thank you.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.722
<i>♪ Oh, bring us
some figgy pudding</i>

14:48.764 --> 14:50.474
<i>♪ Oh, bring us some figgy pudding</i>

14:50.516 --> 14:52.851
<i>♪ Oh, bring us some figgy pudding</i>

14:52.893 --> 14:55.229
<i>♪ And bring it right here</i>

14:56.271 --> 14:58.649

14:58.690 --> 15:02.945
<i>♪ We wish you a merry Christmas
A merry Christmas and... ♪</i>

15:02.986 --> 15:05.280
Oh, surprise!

15:05.322 --> 15:07.824
- Bloody hell.
- I used your spare key.

15:08.617 --> 15:11.286
Do you like it? I thought
you could use some Christmas cheer.

15:11.912 --> 15:13.830
There's a lot of things
I could use right now.

15:13.872 --> 15:16.500
Like getting my gas
and hot water back on.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.920
Haven't had a shower in three days.

15:20.587 --> 15:22.005
Thought there was
a nasty niff in the air.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.050
Come on. Good boy.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.802
Nan always did this in my family.

15:26.844 --> 15:30.389
Bits of wisdom, prayers,
wishes for the New Year.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.975
You write things
you were thankful for in the old one

15:33.016 --> 15:34.309
and then you just hang them
on the tree.

15:37.729 --> 15:39.356
"Thank you for James's friendship."

15:40.232 --> 15:41.525
See? It's not so bad.

15:41.942 --> 15:44.570
"Angels are all around us
if we just know where to look."

15:45.529 --> 15:46.697
Seriously?

15:48.240 --> 15:51.410
You really don't like the holidays,
do you, Ebenezer Grinchface?

15:53.495 --> 15:56.915
I need to work out what's gonna keep
me and Bob going for the month.

16:02.421 --> 16:04.006
Fifteen...

16:11.680 --> 16:13.724
Go on, then, Grinchface.
Give us the news.

16:14.099 --> 16:16.059
I need 200 quid to last the month.

16:16.727 --> 16:17.853
What?

16:19.146 --> 16:22.149
Fifteen to get gas and electric back.
Then four quid a day.

16:22.191 --> 16:24.401
Bus and tube, say 40 quid.

16:24.443 --> 16:26.445
Papers to sell
during the Christmas rush.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.905
Two weeks' food for me and Bob.

16:27.946 --> 16:29.990
- Call that 50 more.
- OK.

16:30.032 --> 16:33.452
It's been ages since he's had
a check-up. Gotta see a vet soon.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.996
Still seems a lot.
Especially the heating.

16:36.788 --> 16:37.998
Earth to Bea.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.666
We're in the worst cold snap
for years.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.585
Earth to Grinchface.

16:42.002 --> 16:45.380
Homeless guy came in to us last week
with frostbite. He lost three toes.

16:46.215 --> 16:48.258
I got given this place
for a good reason, you know.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.344
And no one is regretting
giving it to you.

16:50.802 --> 16:53.347
It was a big step,
and they were happy to help.

16:54.223 --> 16:55.349
Hold on.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.398
A friend. Dr Becky.

17:04.022 --> 17:06.318
She's doing a free vet clinic
at the project on Friday.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.361
Bring Bob.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.954
If you two are still speaking.

17:31.969 --> 17:36.223
OK, mate. You stay there, all right?
It's cold out.

17:45.357 --> 17:47.985
No, Bob. Bob. Stay. Stay.

17:54.950 --> 17:56.076
All right, mate.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.829
Come on, then.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.457
Come on, then. Let's go.

18:11.717 --> 18:14.011
- There's your daddy.
- Hey, darling. How'd you get on?

18:14.052 --> 18:17.472
Well, she did very good, but we have
to stop giving her all those treats.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.724
OK.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.475
OK.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.478
A tale of two kitties, eh, Bob?

18:24.813 --> 18:26.523
If I could afford it,
I would, you know.

18:47.544 --> 18:49.129
- Spare some change?
- No, mate.

18:49.171 --> 18:50.797
- Hey, James.
- Hey.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.925
- Busking in town?
- Maybe later.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.801
- See how the papers go first.
- Ah.

18:55.052 --> 18:57.429
- You've got competition today.
- Yeah.

18:58.013 --> 19:00.265
Any spare change for fighting poverty?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.892
- Hey, mate. You got any spare change?
- No.

19:02.684 --> 19:05.729
No? You got a nice suit, though.
Any spare change? No?

19:06.730 --> 19:07.856
All right, Bob.

19:08.565 --> 19:09.733
Good boy.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.779
- Hello, love, you all right?
- OK, Bob.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.364
Get your blanket out.

19:16.281 --> 19:18.659
Here you are, Bob. Good boy.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.744
Any spare change?

19:22.496 --> 19:24.873
All right, mate. There you go.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.129
- Good boy.
- Any spare change would help.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.468
- <i>Big Issue. Big Issue!</i>
- Spare change?

19:37.135 --> 19:39.680
- They're nice and Christmassy.
- Yeah, I like it.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.600
- Give it a try. Help or buy.
- It's getting busy, isn't it?

19:43.642 --> 19:45.769
- <i>Big Issue,</i> madam?
- Everyone's got a gimmick.

19:46.562 --> 19:49.398
<i>Big Issue! Big Issue,</i> sir?

19:49.439 --> 19:50.941
- Hello, James.
- Hi, Irene.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.234
Hello, Bob.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.571
- Bit hectic today.
- Yeah, nightmare.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.781
- Well, must be off.
- See you.

19:57.823 --> 19:58.866
Bye, Bob.

19:58.907 --> 20:00.701
<i>Big Issue. Big Issue,</i> madam?

20:00.742 --> 20:03.120
- <i>Big Issue. Big Issue,</i> madam?
- Ah, God bless you. God bless you.

20:03.161 --> 20:05.122
Any spare change, please?
Every little helps.

20:05.163 --> 20:07.499
Hey. Watch where you're stepping.

20:07.541 --> 20:09.293
Oh, piss off, mate.
I can step where I like.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.460
Just be careful is all I'm saying.

20:10.502 --> 20:12.129
You shouldn't have
your stupid cat in the way.

20:12.171 --> 20:14.047
- Mate, I'm just trying to work here.
- Well, yeah. So am I.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.883
Right, OK. Idiot.

20:17.634 --> 20:19.678
What'd you say? Huh?
You want some, then, eh?

20:19.720 --> 20:21.138
- Come on, then. Let's have it.
- Hey, James, no.

20:21.180 --> 20:23.390
Just walk away, OK?
I'm just trying to work here.

20:23.432 --> 20:25.601
- We can't have this out here.
- He just nearly stepped on Bob.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.811
- It shouldn't be in the way.
- I've never heard of that charity.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.813
James, people are watching.
People are watching.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.899
- You should watch yourself, mate.
- Can you go?

20:32.691 --> 20:34.943
- All of them are just scammers.
- I know.

20:34.985 --> 20:38.322
Listen, why don't you just come back
and do this tomorrow?

20:38.363 --> 20:41.408
You're not gonna sell anything
anyway, not with this lot round.

20:41.450 --> 20:43.035
- Yeah.
- OK? Sorry.

20:44.244 --> 20:46.330
No, you're probably right.

20:46.371 --> 20:48.290
This way sir. Yeah.

20:48.665 --> 20:51.293
- Yeah. Looking very good.
- Look into the lens, please, sir.

20:51.793 --> 20:54.838
Oh. What a splendid cat.

20:55.714 --> 20:58.008
Ah.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.761
Ah. Sorry. He's a bit hungry.

21:00.802 --> 21:04.598
Ah. Well, I'll tell you what...

21:05.766 --> 21:09.520
Now, you buy her something lovely
to eat tonight, OK?

21:09.561 --> 21:10.771
- Thank you so much.
- Jolly good.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.731
Let's get a photograph, shall we?

21:13.357 --> 21:16.151
- Make it a good one.
- Great. Fabulous. Great.

21:16.985 --> 21:18.237
Right, very good.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.531
Er, well, happy Christmas
to both of you.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.449
- And you. Thank you.
- There we are!

21:22.491 --> 21:23.575
This way, sir!

21:23.617 --> 21:24.618
Give us
a smile! Lovely.

21:32.876 --> 21:34.086
Mug.

21:43.846 --> 21:45.097
Look at that.

21:45.472 --> 21:48.433
A thousand... something.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.160
- I'd like to change this, please.
- Sure.

22:09.288 --> 22:11.582
Have you
seen one of these before?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.750
It's an Albanian lek.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.253
Well, it's one thousand Albanian lek.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.505
- Albanian lek.
- Lek.

22:18.922 --> 22:23.552
Which converts to just over seven...

22:24.970 --> 22:26.346
seven pounds sterling.

22:26.889 --> 22:30.017
Er, seven pounds and 55 pence,
to be precise.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.104
OK. Yeah, I'll take it.

22:34.146 --> 22:36.982
Well, we need our commission,
I'm afraid.

22:37.024 --> 22:40.319
You see, we have a ten-pound minimum.
I'm sorry.

22:41.737 --> 22:44.323
But you could try
the Albanian embassy, maybe.

22:45.741 --> 22:48.785
- Do you know where it is?
- You could Google it.

22:49.786 --> 22:50.913
Thanks.

22:51.663 --> 22:53.081
I like your cat.

23:31.245 --> 23:33.539
I've just explained.
I've already been to four shops.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.541
- They're not selling it anywhere.
- Oh.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.210
- Some woman.
- Hey. Bloody hell.

23:38.544 --> 23:40.546
- Are you OK?
- I'll look in one other shop...

23:40.587 --> 23:42.005
Yes. Yeah.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.551
- Thank you.
- Lunatic.

23:45.592 --> 23:47.845
Look, we can, erm... Down here.

23:47.886 --> 23:49.972
- I just didn't see him coming.
- No.

23:50.013 --> 23:51.682
- Obviously.
- Erm...

23:51.723 --> 23:54.101
- You, er, you hold onto Bob.
- Ooh. Yes.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.854
- OK.
- Hello.

24:00.524 --> 24:01.650
Some people, eh?

24:01.692 --> 24:04.069
Just don't look
where they're going.

24:05.279 --> 24:06.488
There you are.

24:07.072 --> 24:09.157
Thank you so much. Thank you.

24:09.199 --> 24:10.742
That's OK. Don't thank me. Thank Bob.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.996
Don't miss a thing, do you, mister?

24:14.037 --> 24:15.122
What a character you are,

24:15.789 --> 24:17.583
sitting there without a care
in the world.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.335
- OK, can I...
- Yes.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.672
Come on, then, Bob.
Let's go. Let's go, Bob. Let's go.

24:24.339 --> 24:25.757
OK.

24:25.799 --> 24:28.218
Oh. Hang on. I'm sorry. Erm...

24:29.386 --> 24:31.555
Oh, blast. I never have any cash.

24:31.597 --> 24:34.057
Oh, don't worry. It's fine, honestly.
It's OK.

24:34.099 --> 24:36.476
Well, what's your spot? I could pop by

24:36.518 --> 24:39.479
and buy a magazine
or listen to you play.

24:39.813 --> 24:43.108
Er, Covent Garden,
or Angel, outside the tube.

24:44.151 --> 24:45.861
Angel. Of course.

24:47.154 --> 24:49.656
- OK. Hope you're OK.
- Thank you.

24:57.831 --> 25:00.125

25:00.709 --> 25:03.378

25:11.011 --> 25:12.804

25:29.238 --> 25:31.615
The cat's had no say about
whether it's out here or not, has it?

25:32.282 --> 25:33.992
Well,
he doesn't have to do anything.

25:34.034 --> 25:35.327
He's just sat there.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.706
All I'm saying, love, is that
that cat does not look happy to me.

25:40.082 --> 25:43.252
Poor little moggy.
I mean, it's freezing out here.

25:43.585 --> 25:45.963
And imagine being stuck
with a waster like that.

25:46.004 --> 25:48.841
I mean, if you ask me,
people like that,

25:48.882 --> 25:50.384
they shouldn't even be allowed
to own a hamster.

25:50.425 --> 25:54.012
Look, I don't know who you pissed off
to get you transferred to us,

25:54.054 --> 25:56.431
but you stick to the driving
and I'll stick to the animals.

25:56.473 --> 25:58.267
And, please, don't call me that.

25:58.851 --> 26:01.562
- All right. Sorry, sweetheart.
- Give me strength.

26:01.603 --> 26:03.814
No! Come here!

26:03.856 --> 26:05.148
Oi, oi. Here we go.

26:05.190 --> 26:07.276
Get him away from my cat.

26:07.317 --> 26:09.236
Come back here you... Oi, Titan!

26:09.278 --> 26:11.238
- Hey, can you control your dog?
- You stupid mutt.

26:11.280 --> 26:13.490
That's what I'm talking about.
He's endangering that cat.

26:13.532 --> 26:15.409
- Dragging him out here.
- Fine.

26:15.450 --> 26:17.494
You're animal welfare, aren't you?
Why don't you do something?

26:17.536 --> 26:19.663
Fine. We'll pay him
a proper visit later.

26:19.705 --> 26:21.540
But first let's sort out
this comedian.

26:22.374 --> 26:24.084
What's the matter with you?

26:29.590 --> 26:31.675
- Light there, yeah?
- Light here?

26:33.177 --> 26:35.137
It's a bit smudged
there, yeah?

26:36.555 --> 26:40.017
That's good, man.
Do the side bit here.

26:40.225 --> 26:42.227
Here you go, Bob. Look.

26:43.061 --> 26:44.771
Hey, look. Food.

26:46.190 --> 26:49.234
Hey, Bob, what's the matter?
You not hungry?

26:50.068 --> 26:52.905
Hey, what's the matter? Are you OK?

26:53.697 --> 26:55.574
Hey? Are you hurt?

26:56.575 --> 26:58.368
Did that dog do this?

26:59.244 --> 27:00.454
OK.

27:01.288 --> 27:03.081
Little bit of cold in there as well.

27:04.249 --> 27:06.293
Gonna get a bit of this in.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.921
Yeah.

27:09.838 --> 27:13.342
It's gonna be nice, Bob.
Yeah. Nice bubbles.

27:13.383 --> 27:16.136
Nice. Nice bit of water.

27:16.178 --> 27:18.180
Get you all clean.
Look at that. Right.

27:19.681 --> 27:22.559
OK. Let's get this up here.

27:23.435 --> 27:26.188
And then... You gonna come in?

27:26.230 --> 27:28.315
Come on. Come on, Bob.

27:28.357 --> 27:31.276
Sorry, mate. You haven't got a choice.
You gotta do this.

27:31.318 --> 27:33.403
Can't let that get infected.
Come on, Bob.

27:33.737 --> 27:37.115
Come on, Bob. There you go. Good boy.

27:37.157 --> 27:39.409
See? Not so bad, is it?

27:39.952 --> 27:42.496
There you go. Good boy.

27:43.622 --> 27:47.209
Good boy. There you are.
Now you like it. Well done, Bob.

27:48.335 --> 27:49.753
Here, look.

27:50.087 --> 27:52.589
There you go, Bob. Good boy.
Good boy.

27:54.800 --> 27:56.593
OK, take you out.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.263
There you go. Good boy.

27:59.847 --> 28:01.765
Let's get you wrapped up in a towel.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.316
Yeah, just checking me socials.

28:13.318 --> 28:15.070
Oh, I like the jumper.

28:15.445 --> 28:18.657
Wow. Grinchface found
a sense of humour. Hello, handsome.

28:18.949 --> 28:20.534
I thought I'd take you up
on the offer.

28:20.576 --> 28:22.619
- The vet. It's today, right?
- What vet?

28:22.661 --> 28:24.413
- What?
- No, I'm just kidding.

28:24.454 --> 28:26.623
It is today. Right over there.

28:27.332 --> 28:29.459
- You setting up for Christmas dinner?
- Yeah.

28:29.501 --> 28:32.838
We're expecting about 60.
Some telly, board games...

28:32.880 --> 28:34.381
Ah, I love a bit of Monopoly.

28:34.423 --> 28:37.050
Well, you know what they say.
"All property is theft."

28:37.551 --> 28:39.386
I'll leave you to it.
Come find me later.

28:39.428 --> 28:40.554
OK.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.989
No, leave the chicken alone.
Don't look at the chicken.

28:59.990 --> 29:02.034
OK, who's next?

29:04.036 --> 29:06.246
So, this is the famous Bob.

29:06.288 --> 29:08.832
- I've heard a lot about you.
- All good, I hope.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.167
Yeah. Yeah, all good.

29:10.709 --> 29:11.835
So, how's he doing?

29:12.503 --> 29:14.713
Actually, he got
a bit of a scratch yesterday.

29:14.755 --> 29:16.381
Erm, a dog went for him.

29:16.423 --> 29:18.592
I don't know if it was that
or he got caught trying to get away.

29:18.634 --> 29:19.927
Just back here.

29:20.594 --> 29:22.763
Erm, I didn't notice it
till I got home.

29:23.931 --> 29:25.974
Let's have a look.

29:26.016 --> 29:28.894
- It's OK, mate. You're OK.
- Ooh. Yeah, I see.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.772
Yeah, it's not much, but you're right
to come and get it looked at.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.774
There's always a danger of infection.

29:33.815 --> 29:35.484
All right, well,
why don't you leave him with me?

29:35.526 --> 29:38.195
- Erm... I'll be ten minutes.
- OK.

29:38.237 --> 29:40.155
You be good.

29:41.073 --> 29:42.908
I'll take care of you, Bob.

29:59.466 --> 30:02.177
- Need a hand?
- That'd be good, yeah.

30:12.771 --> 30:14.273
What's that saying?

30:15.274 --> 30:18.110
"Christmas isn't a season.
It's a feeling."

30:19.528 --> 30:21.947
I shouldn't fall for it, really,
but I do.

30:23.323 --> 30:24.449
Every year.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.705
Go on, then.
I can tell you're dying to.

30:29.746 --> 30:33.125
No, it's fine.
Whatever you're feeling. It's cool.

30:41.508 --> 30:45.262
I blame Nan. She lived for Christmas.

30:45.512 --> 30:47.806
Started soaking
her plum pudding in brandy in August.

30:47.848 --> 30:48.891
Hmm.

30:50.058 --> 30:52.019
Decorations up
the day after Bonfire Night.

30:53.729 --> 30:56.023
Felt sorry for me, I think.
Being fostered.

30:56.440 --> 30:59.151
Had to give me twice the Christmas
normal kids got.

31:00.194 --> 31:01.361
I don't know.

31:02.446 --> 31:05.199
Maybe it's in my DNA,
revering the ancestors and all.

31:09.203 --> 31:11.413
Whatever form your family takes,

31:11.997 --> 31:13.916
that's what Christmas is about,
I think.

31:14.917 --> 31:16.210
It's important.

31:19.171 --> 31:20.589
Bit different for you, then?

31:22.799 --> 31:26.428
I woke up one Christmas morning
in a psychiatric ward.

31:28.096 --> 31:29.556
<i>Didn't know where I was.</i>

31:30.933 --> 31:32.684
<i>Doctor standing over me
with a needle...</i>

31:33.685 --> 31:36.355
of God knows what. Then...

31:38.190 --> 31:39.650
zoning out again.

31:42.069 --> 31:43.362
How old were you?

31:45.656 --> 31:48.367
Six. Seven.

31:56.250 --> 32:00.838
Tested me for schizophrenia, bipolar.

32:03.674 --> 32:07.052
That's it, then?
No other Christmas memories?

32:09.096 --> 32:11.390
I remember hearing my dad's voice
on the phone one year.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.019
<i>From the other side
of the world.</i>

32:18.272 --> 32:19.940
Wishing he was in the next room.

32:23.819 --> 32:24.820
But he wasn't.

32:30.534 --> 32:34.454
Look at that. It's one of
the richest places on the planet.

32:36.039 --> 32:37.374
Someone's down there right now

32:37.416 --> 32:40.002
blowing two grand on a bottle of wine.

32:40.294 --> 32:43.630
Yeah, and I'll send home
a family of five

32:43.672 --> 32:46.466
with macaroni and tinned fruit
to last them a week.

32:47.593 --> 32:48.760
Go figure.

32:50.387 --> 32:53.807
Doesn't add up.
It's like some of us are invisible.

32:55.058 --> 32:56.685
No, they know we're here.

32:58.270 --> 33:00.856
- Why else puts spikes on doorways?
- Mm.

33:02.149 --> 33:03.692
They just want us out of sight.

33:07.070 --> 33:08.113
Yeah.

33:14.828 --> 33:17.039
- I should, erm...
- Yeah.

33:22.961 --> 33:25.672
Right. Well, I have cleaned him up

33:25.714 --> 33:28.509
and I've given him
an injection of antibiotic.

33:28.550 --> 33:30.636
He might be sore for a day or two,

33:30.677 --> 33:33.055
but other than that
he's in really good nick.

33:33.722 --> 33:36.266
- Hear that, Bob? High five.
- Mm-hm.

33:36.308 --> 33:37.434
Five.

33:37.726 --> 33:39.895
High five. Thanks a lot.

33:39.937 --> 33:42.564
Come on, then, mister.
OK, come on, then. On we go.

33:43.690 --> 33:46.735
- Good boy. Thank you very much.
- Pleasure.

33:51.073 --> 33:54.076
It's gonna be a good day today, Bob.
I can feel it.

33:57.663 --> 33:59.831
- Aww.
- All right.

34:01.416 --> 34:03.293
- Ah, it's Bob!
- That is Bob.

34:04.795 --> 34:05.879
Ah.

34:08.465 --> 34:09.882
- Hi!
- Ah.

34:17.975 --> 34:19.309
James.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.020
James.

34:22.437 --> 34:24.398
James.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.692
- There you are.
- Hi.

34:26.733 --> 34:28.777
Guess what else I found for Bob.

34:28.819 --> 34:30.571
- Oh, Irene, really, you don't have to.
- No.

34:32.406 --> 34:35.576
Oh. Irene. That's, erm...

34:38.078 --> 34:41.123
Who'd like to hear
some Christmas carols, Bob style?

34:41.164 --> 34:42.583
Yeah!

35:44.520 --> 35:45.979
- I can be, yeah.
- Right.

35:46.021 --> 35:48.148
I've got a big party
of Asian tourists coming in.

35:48.190 --> 35:49.608
They'd love you lot. Good money.

35:49.900 --> 35:51.985
Pose for a few photos, a few songs.
What do you think?

35:52.027 --> 35:54.238
Yeah, that would be amazing.
What time?

35:54.530 --> 35:56.031
- Midday?
- OK.

35:56.573 --> 35:58.700
- Life saver. Good man. See you then.
- All right. No worries.

36:12.714 --> 36:14.508
I know. I know.

36:14.925 --> 36:16.969
Might have spent a little too much.

36:18.929 --> 36:20.848
But it was a great day.

36:21.849 --> 36:23.183
Look at that.

36:24.726 --> 36:26.186
We're almost halfway there already.

36:26.812 --> 36:27.980
And...

36:29.106 --> 36:32.317
there's more coming.

36:50.335 --> 36:51.670
See this, Bob?

36:53.338 --> 36:55.507
That was you and me
when we were on our own.

36:57.759 --> 36:58.969

38:19.341 --> 38:20.884
Good afternoon.

38:21.802 --> 38:25.430
I'm Animal Welfare Officer Davies.
This is my colleague, Mr Booth.

38:25.472 --> 38:27.766
We wanted to chat to you
about a couple of concerns.

38:27.808 --> 38:30.227
- What sort of concerns?
- Ooh, I'm sure it'll be fine.

38:30.269 --> 38:32.604
Just wanna make sure
he's happy, healthy.

38:32.646 --> 38:34.898
Yeah, course he is. Look at him.

38:35.399 --> 38:37.025
- What's his name?
- Er, Bob.

38:37.985 --> 38:39.528
- Bob. Nice to meet you.
- Bob.

38:39.570 --> 38:41.071
If it's OK,
I'd like to take a look at him,

38:41.113 --> 38:43.365
- maybe take a couple of photos?
- Yep.

38:43.407 --> 38:44.825
Shall I take him to the van, yeah?

38:44.867 --> 38:46.702
Leave it, Leon.

38:48.287 --> 38:51.290
- Bob. Bob, no.
- It's OK, Bob.

38:51.331 --> 38:54.376
- Just gotta be slow.
- Hey, that's OK.

39:02.593 --> 39:05.053
Ah, he had an injection there
the other day.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.306
- He might be a bit sore.
- Injection?

39:07.806 --> 39:10.726
Yeah, he had a little scratch.
I don't know what from.

39:10.767 --> 39:12.936
But the vet just wanted to give him
some antibiotics

39:12.978 --> 39:14.688
just to make sure
it didn't get infected.

39:14.730 --> 39:17.107
- You got the paperwork for that?
- Yeah, at home.

39:17.357 --> 39:18.775
I can send it on to you.

39:18.817 --> 39:20.652
Yeah. Here are my details.

39:21.069 --> 39:23.530
- Can I get yours as well?
- Er, yeah.

39:24.281 --> 39:25.949
Is Bob microchipped?

39:26.450 --> 39:29.119
Er, yeah, under my name. James Bowen.

39:29.411 --> 39:31.121
Sorry, I've just gotta turn this on.

39:31.163 --> 39:33.916
You need to keep that on
in case we need you.

39:34.208 --> 39:36.960
Is there anyone else we could talk
to, someone that knows you and Bob?

39:37.294 --> 39:40.005
Er, my friend Bea. She works
at a charity on Upper Street.

39:40.047 --> 39:41.882
I can give you her number. Hang on.

39:47.179 --> 39:50.390
- Is there anything else I can do or...
- You could get a haircut.

39:50.432 --> 39:51.433
Ah.

39:54.019 --> 39:57.523
Maybe write a statement.
Er, how long you've had Bob.

39:57.564 --> 39:59.107
What his life is like.
That sort of thing.

40:00.984 --> 40:03.737
- Just in case.
- In case of what?

40:03.779 --> 40:07.282
Well, might get referred
up to the authorities, see.

40:07.491 --> 40:09.159
Might need a court to decide

40:09.201 --> 40:12.079
whether you're fit enough
to keep him or not.

40:12.788 --> 40:14.373
In case I'm good enough to keep?

40:14.665 --> 40:16.500
Of course I can keep...
You can't take him away from me.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.252
No, no. That's where
you're wrong, sunshine. See, we can.

40:18.293 --> 40:19.878
- Hey. Let's... let's... Hey!
- If it's in the cat's best interest...

40:19.920 --> 40:20.963
- Don't touch me.
- ...we can.

40:21.004 --> 40:22.756
- Calm down. Calm down.
- I didn't touch you.

40:22.798 --> 40:24.842
- Both of you calm down, please.
- He's completely fine.

40:24.883 --> 40:27.177
Listen, let's not get ahead
of ourselves. Both of you.

40:35.227 --> 40:37.020
Bea, you gotta help me.

40:37.396 --> 40:39.857
Someone's gonna call you about Bob.
Animal welfare.

40:39.898 --> 40:42.734
I think her name's Ruth.
Bloke she's with is a total prick.

40:42.776 --> 40:45.112
And, er, I don't know,
I gave them your number.

40:45.153 --> 40:46.405
I said you could vouch for us.

40:46.446 --> 40:50.117
I don't know if someone targeted us
or if they reported me or...

40:50.534 --> 40:52.202
I don't know. Who'd...

40:54.538 --> 40:57.040
- What's the matter?
- Why is it always about you, James?

41:00.043 --> 41:01.128
What's happened?

41:02.254 --> 41:03.547
Look around you.

41:05.007 --> 41:07.509
Break-in last night.
They took everything.

41:07.801 --> 41:11.346
All of our food, telly,
computers, bedding.

41:12.598 --> 41:13.932
Everything they could.

41:14.349 --> 41:16.059
I mean, who the hell
steals from a project

41:16.101 --> 41:17.436
for people who've got nothing?

41:18.770 --> 41:19.938
Can you get more stuff?

41:20.856 --> 41:24.484
With what, James? Shirt buttons?

41:27.321 --> 41:28.572
We haven't got any money.

41:29.823 --> 41:31.533
Christmas Day's not happening.

41:35.245 --> 41:37.414
Bea. Bea.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.932
<i>Is there anything else
I can do?</i>

41:54.973 --> 41:58.227
<i>Maybe write a statement.
How long you've had Bob.</i>

41:58.268 --> 42:00.521
<i>What his life is like.
That sort of thing.</i>

42:51.697 --> 42:55.492
<i>Lovely. Now, like every chef, I need
to have a little bit of refreshment.</i>

42:56.285 --> 43:00.247
<i>The chocolate chips will sort of just
evenly distribute themselves.</i>

43:18.932 --> 43:20.767
Right, Bob. Come on, then, Bob.

43:21.977 --> 43:23.604
Now, let's go.

43:23.937 --> 43:26.481
Good boy. OK.

43:29.276 --> 43:32.070
OK, come on, then.
Out we go. This way.

43:32.821 --> 43:36.074
Let's go. This way. Good boy.

43:54.301 --> 43:56.094
All right, mate. What do you need?

43:56.136 --> 43:58.514
- No, I'm good.
- Come on, I know you.

43:58.555 --> 44:00.432
- You like the good stuff.
- I said no.

44:01.099 --> 44:03.727
- When did you turn into such a prick?
- Are you gonna piss off?

44:04.478 --> 44:05.646
Or what?

44:08.023 --> 44:09.441
Bob.

44:09.942 --> 44:11.985
- Hey, get off!
- Give me the bag.

44:12.027 --> 44:14.154
- Give me the bag.
- Get off!

44:14.530 --> 44:16.490
Get off!

44:23.830 --> 44:25.123
Are you OK?

44:26.375 --> 44:27.543
You all right?

44:31.171 --> 44:33.382
Oh.

44:39.847 --> 44:41.098
Come on, mate.

44:43.141 --> 44:45.352
Maybe we can still do some pics.
Come on.

44:56.405 --> 44:57.739
Come in, guys. Sit down.

45:00.659 --> 45:04.830
I've just got an email
asking me to comment on this.

45:06.498 --> 45:09.251
Apparently someone sent it
to the local news station.

45:09.293 --> 45:12.129
- <i>Calm down.</i>
- <i>I'm working here with my cat, OK?</i>

45:14.423 --> 45:16.633
<i>Can we not, can we not do this?</i>

45:17.342 --> 45:19.636
Look, this isn't
what it looks like.

45:19.678 --> 45:21.138
It is exactly what it looks like.

45:21.180 --> 45:23.182
It's exactly
the sort of brainless behaviour

45:23.223 --> 45:25.684
that got you transferred here
in the first place.

45:26.852 --> 45:30.022
So, I'm gonna tell you
exactly what happens now.

45:30.564 --> 45:32.983
Ruth, talk to the TV company.

45:33.567 --> 45:36.195
Make a "no comment" comment.

45:36.236 --> 45:39.781
We don't discuss ongoing inquiries,
blah, blah, blah.

45:39.823 --> 45:42.034
- Right.
- And find witnesses.

45:42.075 --> 45:44.536
Anyone who can tell us what the RSPCA
will need to know,

45:44.578 --> 45:46.163
if we pass it up to them.

45:46.538 --> 45:48.540
- Is...
- Bob.

45:48.582 --> 45:51.168
Is Bob in a safe home?

45:51.585 --> 45:54.254
Separated from other animals?
You know the drill.

45:54.296 --> 45:56.423
Oh, I've had some joy
already there, boss.

45:56.465 --> 45:59.384
Spoke to housing.
Mr Bowen's in assisted accommodation.

45:59.718 --> 46:01.887
Keeps it tidy, no other animals.

46:01.929 --> 46:03.305
Is the animal healthy?

46:03.680 --> 46:05.891
I need to check out his story
on taking it to the vet,

46:05.933 --> 46:07.226
but he seemed OK.

46:08.185 --> 46:11.647
OK. Well, keep talking to people.
And remember the law.

46:11.688 --> 46:16.401
Is Bob free to display, and I quote,
"normal behaviour patterns"?

46:18.320 --> 46:20.072
And as for you, stay out of it.

46:20.322 --> 46:21.865
You might be right
on this one,

46:21.907 --> 46:23.325
but I can't afford to be wrong.

46:24.117 --> 46:26.537
I'm not gonna be plastered
all over the papers.

46:26.578 --> 46:30.165
Cruella de Muswell Hill.
It's not happening.

46:31.625 --> 46:32.793
If a guy who works on the street

46:32.835 --> 46:35.504
is being separated from his cat
at Christmas,

46:35.546 --> 46:37.798
it's got to be done
by the book. Got it?

46:38.298 --> 46:39.716
Yes, boss.

46:40.801 --> 46:41.802
Yes.

46:42.553 --> 46:43.595
Hello.

46:44.346 --> 46:46.139
- Here we are. Is that you, yeah?
- Hello.

46:46.181 --> 46:48.684
Excellent. On you pop.
Nice one. Hello.

46:48.725 --> 46:51.728
Thank you. Hello.
Thank you for a good trip.

46:51.770 --> 46:54.648
There we go. That's you.
In you go. Did you have fun?

46:54.690 --> 46:57.234
- See the sights, yeah?
- So stupid.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.243
See ya.

47:15.419 --> 47:19.173
- Yes, mate, that's the one over there.
- That's the one over there.

47:19.214 --> 47:20.507
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

47:23.135 --> 47:25.721
Yeah, all right. Righto.

47:32.352 --> 47:33.687
There you go.

47:46.533 --> 47:48.869
Oh, no. No, no, no.

47:50.245 --> 47:51.330
Idiot.

47:53.332 --> 47:54.333
Stupid.

48:15.979 --> 48:17.648
That's gone as well.

48:26.907 --> 48:28.242
I'll be right back.

48:31.995 --> 48:34.414
Don't let the elephants out.

48:35.374 --> 48:38.210
Hi, Moody.
Twenty on the electric, please.

48:39.253 --> 48:41.296
Big freeze coming in from Greenland.

48:41.547 --> 48:43.632
Ah, great. When?

48:44.049 --> 48:47.511
End of the week, I think.
Best tune in to the radio.

48:48.136 --> 48:49.137
Thanks.

48:49.972 --> 48:52.599
Er... There you are.

48:56.562 --> 48:59.231
Do you have any tape?
My guitar's bust.

48:59.273 --> 49:00.440
Hmm.

49:01.316 --> 49:03.151
Here. Use mine.

49:03.402 --> 49:04.903
Oh. Thank you.

49:21.712 --> 49:24.214
Bob, no! Ah!

49:24.256 --> 49:26.341
Bob! What have you...

49:29.261 --> 49:30.721
Stinks.

49:38.478 --> 49:39.646
Thank you.

49:45.277 --> 49:47.613
Excuse me, ma'am. Five-minute warning.

49:47.654 --> 49:49.865
- <i>Calm down.</i>
- <i>I'm working here with my cat.</i>

49:49.907 --> 49:52.367
<i>We are conducting
a routine investigation,</i>

49:52.409 --> 49:54.411
<i>but we're also appealing
to the public for help.</i>

49:54.703 --> 49:59.082
{\an8}<i>Anyone who knows the man and the cat
in the video or the photograph,</i>

49:59.124 --> 50:00.667
{\an8}<i>please get in touch...</i>

50:00.709 --> 50:03.754
- Ma'am, five minutes.
- Yes. Sorry, darling. Thank you.

50:03.795 --> 50:05.964
<i>...so that we can resolve
where the cat should be.</i>

50:14.264 --> 50:16.850
<i>And they say there's
a cold front coming in this weekend</i>

50:16.892 --> 50:18.227
<i>just in time for Christmas.</i>

50:18.268 --> 50:20.395
- <i>Might even get a bit of snow.</i>
- Brilliant.

50:20.437 --> 50:23.524
<i>Could be a white Christmas this year.
How do we feel about that?</i>

50:23.565 --> 50:25.526
<i>Hey, it's what
we're dreaming about, right?</i>

50:25.567 --> 50:27.611
<i>You're listening
to the sounds of the season.</i>

50:27.653 --> 50:30.489
<i>Traffic and weather,
together on drive time.</i>

50:30.531 --> 50:33.075
Are you coming, mate?

50:33.534 --> 50:34.743
No?

50:35.911 --> 50:37.621
I'd stay there too if I could.

50:38.872 --> 50:40.499
See you later, monster.

51:04.773 --> 51:06.400
Next batch!

51:08.068 --> 51:10.279
Where shall I put this, Sarah?
Over there?

51:10.320 --> 51:11.780
Just back there.

51:12.948 --> 51:16.451
Sorry. Excuse me. I'm looking
for a Miss Chan. Bea Chan.

51:16.493 --> 51:18.453
- She's just over there.
- Thank you.

51:20.831 --> 51:22.457
It looks pretty full-on.

51:22.791 --> 51:26.712
Yeah, it was hard enough,
but we just got burgled as well.

51:26.753 --> 51:28.505
That's awful. I'm so sorry.

51:29.339 --> 51:30.757
It's gonna be a long winter.

51:30.966 --> 51:32.676
Then I'll be as quick as I can.

51:33.719 --> 51:36.597
So, Bea, how long have you known
Mr Bowen and Bob?

51:36.638 --> 51:38.599
Nine months, maybe ten.

51:39.224 --> 51:41.435
I go round to James's flat
fairly regularly.

51:41.476 --> 51:45.189
I see. Is it true that Bob
was recently seen by a vet here?

51:45.230 --> 51:48.984
- Yeah. Dr Becky.
- Bob was injured somehow?

51:49.026 --> 51:50.444
It was just a scratch.

51:50.485 --> 51:54.364
James brought Bob in first thing.
Becky fixed him right up.

51:55.824 --> 51:58.660
- Do you want her number?
- Yes, please.

51:58.952 --> 52:01.872
Erm, so you've known them
almost a year.

52:02.623 --> 52:05.626
Is there anything in Bob's behaviour
that struck you during that time?

52:05.876 --> 52:06.877
In what way?

52:06.919 --> 52:09.880
Well, it's not normal for a cat
to be out on the streets most days.

52:09.922 --> 52:12.841
Bob was a stray. That's where
he lived till he teamed up with James.

52:12.883 --> 52:15.052
Uh, I didn't know that.

52:15.093 --> 52:17.763
But some might say
spending his days with James,

52:17.804 --> 52:20.641
it's not exactly a suitable
environment, not normal behaviour.

52:22.601 --> 52:24.895
You know cats. Obviously.

52:25.812 --> 52:27.773
- Lost mine in the summer.
- Hm.

52:28.106 --> 52:30.817
Dexter. He was a real star.

52:30.859 --> 52:33.070
But, so, yes, I'd say so.

52:33.445 --> 52:35.113
Pretty independent creatures.

52:35.155 --> 52:36.740
Not gonna do anything
they don't wanna do.

52:36.782 --> 52:38.784
Oh, definitely not.

52:38.825 --> 52:42.663
So every day before he leaves home,
James gives Bob the choice,

52:42.704 --> 52:46.208
to stay at home in the warm alone
or go out with him.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.794
And every day, well, almost every day,

52:49.127 --> 52:50.462
Bob goes with him.

52:50.921 --> 52:52.214
And what about James?

52:52.756 --> 52:56.301
Is he... Is his home life stable?

52:57.302 --> 53:01.139
James is no saint,
but he's taken big steps.

53:01.181 --> 53:04.643
And Bob's given him responsibility,
not something he's had before.

53:05.352 --> 53:08.438
Two musketeers.
All for one, one for all.

53:08.647 --> 53:11.525
When James went cold turkey,
Bob never left him for a minute.

53:12.317 --> 53:14.069
Was he using when he had Bob?

53:14.444 --> 53:17.573
He was on the programme. Methadone.

53:18.490 --> 53:20.534
Bob gave him the strength
to get clean.

53:22.327 --> 53:26.415
If you were to split them up,
it doesn't bear thinking about.

53:26.999 --> 53:29.835
I don't wanna keep you.
You've been a great help.

53:30.294 --> 53:31.545
Thanks.

53:34.840 --> 53:38.760
You're not really thinking about
taking Bob away from him, are you?

53:39.428 --> 53:41.138
We need to do what's best for Bob.

53:41.805 --> 53:44.099
It's not only up to me. Sorry.

55:07.641 --> 55:10.644
I just don't. Hey, mate.

55:10.686 --> 55:13.230
We're off for a wee Christmas pint.
Want to join us?

55:16.567 --> 55:18.068
Come on, you two.

55:19.069 --> 55:21.113
Peace on earth,
goodwill to men and all that.

55:21.154 --> 55:22.573
Hmph.

55:22.614 --> 55:25.993
Hey, first pint's on me.
Come on, before he defrosts.

55:26.034 --> 55:27.619
- OK.
- Good man.

55:27.661 --> 55:30.914
- Er, not great.
- Tell us all about it.

55:32.249 --> 55:33.292
Thanks, Dave.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.877
See you later. Cheers.
Merry Christmas.

55:34.918 --> 55:37.171
Do you think I'd sell more papers
if I had a cat?

55:37.462 --> 55:39.923
- Erm, I don't think so.
- Sorry.

55:40.382 --> 55:41.675
- All right.
- Sorry.

55:41.925 --> 55:43.802
Listen, suits are your thing.
Look at you.

55:43.844 --> 55:45.971
- Look at the effort that you put in.
- Sorry.

55:47.097 --> 55:50.184
I mean, you could get
a bunny outfit for Easter.

55:50.225 --> 55:53.061
- Sorry.
- Love heart for Valentine's.

55:53.353 --> 55:56.231
Er, Pete, watch you don't melt,
sitting by that fire there.

55:57.566 --> 55:59.735
Cos he's a snowman.

56:01.653 --> 56:02.946
Here, I've got a good one for you.

56:02.988 --> 56:05.073
What do you call a snowman
who works at a bakery?

56:06.658 --> 56:09.578
- A baker.
- It's funny.

56:10.078 --> 56:12.539
- Hm.
- Wow. Tough crowd.

56:12.915 --> 56:15.626
It's funny.
It's funny.

56:21.465 --> 56:25.093
All right, let's hear it.
You got a problem with me?

56:25.969 --> 56:27.012
I don't know. Do I?

56:27.930 --> 56:29.681
You will have
if you don't spit it out.

56:31.350 --> 56:34.520
I know it was you who shopped me
to the animal welfare people.

56:35.771 --> 56:36.980
What?

56:37.814 --> 56:40.651
I saw you the other day
near Covent Garden tube.

56:41.068 --> 56:44.071
Yeah, you and your mate
in the council van, pointing at us.

56:45.072 --> 56:46.907
Why are you helping them
spy on me and Bob?

56:47.449 --> 56:48.450
Spying?

56:49.493 --> 56:50.702
On your cat?

56:51.912 --> 56:53.747
Why would I be spying on your cat?

56:53.789 --> 56:55.290
I don't know. You tell me.

56:55.707 --> 56:58.877
White van?

57:00.170 --> 57:01.255
James Street?

57:02.047 --> 57:03.215
That was Danny.

57:03.841 --> 57:07.010
He had some work for me.
School had frozen pipes.

57:07.052 --> 57:09.054
Wanted me to thaw 'em out.
Picked me up from there.

57:10.472 --> 57:11.682
Look.

57:12.558 --> 57:14.059
I didn't know you were there.

57:14.977 --> 57:16.478
Hardly worth it, is it?

57:20.983 --> 57:22.442
Fifteen quid.

57:26.989 --> 57:31.451
So, tell me, how did you get the cat?

57:33.662 --> 57:35.247
I found him in my flat.

57:36.415 --> 57:40.252
He was a stray.
He wouldn't leave me alone.

57:42.713 --> 57:44.047
Jammy sod.

57:44.798 --> 57:46.758
Won't deny he pulls in the punters.

57:47.926 --> 57:49.219
I didn't mean that.

57:50.345 --> 57:53.599
I couldn't care what you make.
You're lucky to have him.

57:53.640 --> 57:54.725
Mm-hmm.

57:55.642 --> 57:58.604
When you look after someone, it gives
you purpose, it gives you meaning.

58:00.480 --> 58:02.024
It makes you a better person.

58:08.238 --> 58:09.573
I've got a little girl.

58:11.366 --> 58:12.367
Maisie.

58:15.078 --> 58:17.206
Not so little any more.

58:21.168 --> 58:23.587
And a junked-up teenager
in a Ford Fiesta...

58:27.508 --> 58:30.010
Took me nine months
to walk again, so...

58:32.095 --> 58:33.597
I don't miss much.

58:34.515 --> 58:36.850
Don't miss her mother.

58:41.813 --> 58:42.814
I miss Maisie, though.

58:47.778 --> 58:50.197
So... So where is she now?

58:50.864 --> 58:51.865
Maisie?

58:52.991 --> 58:56.161
West London. She's got a kid.

58:56.828 --> 58:58.038
Never met him.

58:59.748 --> 59:01.583
I wonder if he might
look like me, you know.

59:02.626 --> 59:04.962
If he's lucky.

59:06.755 --> 59:07.923
Nah.

59:09.591 --> 59:11.343
She don't need me in her life.

59:15.264 --> 59:18.767
You're inside there... somewhere.

59:31.238 --> 59:32.906
That's me done.

59:36.201 --> 59:37.202
See you around.

59:50.966 --> 59:52.259
<i>Lucky to have him.</i>

59:52.509 --> 59:55.387
<i>When you look after someone, it gives
you purpose, it gives you meaning.</i>

59:56.889 --> 59:58.473
<i>It makes you a better person.</i>

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:09.503
Hey, Bob.
Guess who I've just been out with?

01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:13.257
Mick. Yeah. Of all people.

01:01:14.091 --> 01:01:17.010
Nasty Mick. Mick the spy.

01:01:17.511 --> 01:01:19.429
Except he's not a spy after all.

01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:23.308
Bob. Come on, mate.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:25.143
Must be hungry.
Come and get your dinner.

01:01:30.190 --> 01:01:32.276
Bob? Bob.

01:01:35.445 --> 01:01:36.572
Bob.

01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:38.740
Mate, are you OK?

01:01:39.533 --> 01:01:40.534
Bob.

01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:44.746
Come on.

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.206
Erm.

01:01:46.915 --> 01:01:48.917
Come on,
pull yourself together. Think.

01:02:08.729 --> 01:02:11.106
<i>This is Dr Becky
at the Green Veterinary Centre.</i>

01:02:11.148 --> 01:02:12.608
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:15.736
Dr Becky, it's Bea's friend, James.

01:02:15.777 --> 01:02:18.739
Erm, it's Bob, my cat. He's sick.

01:02:19.364 --> 01:02:20.657
Really sick.

01:02:20.949 --> 01:02:22.201
Call me, please.

01:02:39.885 --> 01:02:42.471
- Don't let the elephants...
- You gotta help me.

01:02:46.016 --> 01:02:48.227
Is he eating? Drinking?

01:02:48.268 --> 01:02:49.436
Nothing.

01:02:51.396 --> 01:02:53.649
Let's put a bowl of water by his head.

01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:55.275
And we should keep him warm.

01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:19.633
- Did you write these?
- Some.

01:03:20.801 --> 01:03:22.553
My friend Bea's idea.

01:03:25.305 --> 01:03:27.224
Hmm.

01:03:27.724 --> 01:03:29.434
Should never have let him come out
in this weather.

01:03:30.227 --> 01:03:32.229
Wouldn't have animal welfare
on my case.

01:03:32.271 --> 01:03:33.564
Animal welfare?

01:03:34.189 --> 01:03:35.274
Erm...

01:03:41.530 --> 01:03:43.365
They're threatening to take Bob away.

01:03:47.870 --> 01:03:49.204
Maybe they should.

01:04:02.801 --> 01:04:04.595
I don't know how you did it with Mo.

01:04:05.137 --> 01:04:09.224
Just sitting there, waiting.

01:04:12.352 --> 01:04:14.521
Well, from the outside
it looks very different.

01:04:15.439 --> 01:04:18.901
You just deal with it.
It becomes your reality.

01:04:22.362 --> 01:04:23.572
How do you go on?

01:04:28.911 --> 01:04:33.498
There were three pilgrims
on a journey to a holy place.

01:04:34.333 --> 01:04:36.376
Each had suffered great sadness.

01:04:36.752 --> 01:04:40.255
Each was looking for peace,
a way ahead.

01:04:41.173 --> 01:04:43.175
Each had two sacks,

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.886
one on his back, the other
round the neck at his front.

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:51.141
The first man
filled the sack on his back

01:04:51.183 --> 01:04:52.684
with all the good things in his life.

01:04:52.726 --> 01:04:55.896
Like your tree.
Happy thoughts, memories.

01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:57.272
OK.

01:04:58.357 --> 01:05:01.235
At the front,
he kept all the bad things.

01:05:01.527 --> 01:05:04.238
His sadness, guilt. Bad memories.

01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:08.534
Because he, he wanted to think
about them. Make sense of them.

01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.661
Even though there was none to be made.

01:05:11.662 --> 01:05:15.249
Because of this,
he didn't make much progress.

01:05:15.290 --> 01:05:16.917
He soon gave up the journey.

01:05:16.959 --> 01:05:18.418
I had a feeling he would.

01:05:18.669 --> 01:05:21.046
Now, the second man.

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:23.715
He carried
the good things at the front.

01:05:23.966 --> 01:05:25.592
He liked to show them off.

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:30.514
He kept the bad things on his back,
even though they weighed heavily.

01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:35.269
His journey was slow as well.
He too gave up.

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:37.396
The third one got it right,
I'm betting.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.438
No.

01:05:38.897 --> 01:05:41.108
He also carried the good things
at the front,

01:05:41.149 --> 01:05:44.570
but to him they were an inspiration.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:46.738
Like...

01:05:47.614 --> 01:05:49.992
sails on a ship, moving him faster.

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:53.161
And he didn't carry anything
on his back?

01:05:53.203 --> 01:05:54.913
Yes, he did.

01:05:55.664 --> 01:05:57.541
But he cut a hole in that sack,

01:05:58.458 --> 01:06:02.212
so all the bad things
slowly dropped onto the road.

01:06:02.838 --> 01:06:03.881
Hmm.

01:06:06.550 --> 01:06:09.428
- And he reached the holy place?
- And found a new way forward.

01:06:13.098 --> 01:06:14.600
So which one was you?

01:06:21.023 --> 01:06:22.608
I have been all three.

01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:28.363
But now I just carry my good memories
of Mo and let them inspire me.

01:06:30.157 --> 01:06:31.617
And the bad?

01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:37.581
Mm. That took a while.

01:06:38.749 --> 01:06:41.627
But now I understand...

01:06:43.795 --> 01:06:48.383
the greatest act of love I showed Mo
was in letting him go.

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:50.511
To a better place.

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:55.015
So, the memories...

01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:00.938
the beeping of that machine,
the tubes, the wires,

01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:03.815
the signing of those forms,

01:07:04.983 --> 01:07:06.735
I was free to let them go too.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.450
You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.

01:07:14.201 --> 01:07:15.911
You will get to where you need to go.

01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:20.123
But what about him?

01:07:23.752 --> 01:07:25.963
Maybe he will be
a part of that journey.

01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:28.382
But if not,

01:07:29.550 --> 01:07:32.636
you have already proved
your love a hundred times over.

01:07:38.350 --> 01:07:41.937
I had better go.
It's already Christmas Eve.

01:07:43.146 --> 01:07:47.025
Busy day ahead. Let me know
if there's anything I can do. Hmm?

01:09:06.979 --> 01:09:08.232
Bob.

01:09:08.982 --> 01:09:10.192
Bob.

01:09:11.068 --> 01:09:12.444
Bob.

01:09:13.819 --> 01:09:15.197
Bob!

01:09:17.573 --> 01:09:21.453
He'll be in here... somewhere.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:25.957
Always.

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.711
The greatest act of love

01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:31.796
I showed Mo...

01:09:33.256 --> 01:09:35.425
was in letting him go.

01:09:51.483 --> 01:09:54.444
Now, who's a good boy?

01:09:55.445 --> 01:09:57.865
Good boy, Bob.

01:10:22.055 --> 01:10:23.098
Bob.

01:10:38.864 --> 01:10:42.743
It's a stomach thing, probably.
It's not unusual for cats.

01:10:42.784 --> 01:10:45.621
Has he eaten anything he shouldn't
in the past 48 hours?

01:10:46.663 --> 01:10:48.040
Yeah. Erm...

01:10:48.707 --> 01:10:51.210
Some chicken.
Some old food from the fridge.

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:53.879
- It had all gone off.
- Did he vomit?

01:10:53.921 --> 01:10:55.339
Yeah, lots.

01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:57.299
That's good.
That's nature taking its course.

01:10:57.716 --> 01:11:00.552
And the rest will have just
worked its way through his system.

01:11:00.886 --> 01:11:02.804
He'll be all right now.

01:11:04.890 --> 01:11:06.850
He doesn't deserve to live like this.

01:11:06.892 --> 01:11:09.394
Freezing all the time. Getting sick.

01:11:10.354 --> 01:11:13.398
- It's not good enough.
- What are you talking about, James?

01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:18.487
What happens when a cat
gets taken in by animal welfare?

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.991
Do they have those smart cat kennels,
like, they're well looked after?

01:11:23.617 --> 01:11:25.035
I suppose.

01:11:25.077 --> 01:11:26.828
What are you babbling on about?

01:11:27.454 --> 01:11:30.457
You've had a shock, but Bob's fine.

01:11:30.499 --> 01:11:31.708
Yeah, she's right.

01:11:32.584 --> 01:11:36.046
Take time together at Christmas
and Bob will be his old self again.

01:11:37.172 --> 01:11:39.216
You'll soon be back
into the old routine.

01:11:40.259 --> 01:11:43.262
Yeah, well,
that's the problem, isn't it?

01:12:33.687 --> 01:12:37.107
<i>Hi. This is James. Well, James' phone.</i>

01:12:37.149 --> 01:12:39.318
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

01:12:55.667 --> 01:12:57.628
I don't want
to hear any more.

01:12:57.669 --> 01:12:59.171
I think the cat should be separated.

01:12:59.213 --> 01:13:02.257
<i>You've reached the voicemail
for Ruth Davies, animal welfare.</i>

01:13:02.299 --> 01:13:04.051
<i>Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.</i>

01:13:05.177 --> 01:13:06.553
<i>Hi, Ruth. This is James Bowen.</i>

01:13:07.179 --> 01:13:10.766
<i>I've come
to a decision about Bob</i>

01:13:11.183 --> 01:13:13.310
<i>and I need to talk to you.</i>

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:33.121
Hey.

01:13:33.413 --> 01:13:34.915
Hey, hey.

01:13:34.957 --> 01:13:36.083
<i>What about him?</i>

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:40.504
<i>You must not let your future
be weighed down by your past.</i>

01:13:45.092 --> 01:13:48.262
<i>You have already proved your love
a hundred times over.</i>

01:13:55.394 --> 01:13:58.397
Come on, then, mate. Good boy, Bob.

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:10.284
Come on, then, mate.

01:14:32.973 --> 01:14:34.099
That's the guy.

01:15:31.323 --> 01:15:32.783
Platform one,
down the stairs to the right.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.576
- Great. Thank you.
- No worries.

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.954
James, I haven't seen you in days.

01:15:36.995 --> 01:15:38.872
I just came to wish you
a happy Christmas.

01:15:38.914 --> 01:15:40.874
Aww, thank you so much.

01:15:41.166 --> 01:15:44.211
Oh. Hold on there, now.
I have some stuff for you too.

01:15:44.586 --> 01:15:46.839
People came by, dropping these off.

01:15:47.548 --> 01:15:49.258
- It's all for us?
- Mm-hm.

01:15:50.008 --> 01:15:52.886
Wow. Thank you.

01:15:53.303 --> 01:15:55.180
- Come on, Bob.
- Happy Christmas.

01:16:05.858 --> 01:16:07.192
James!

01:16:07.985 --> 01:16:09.319
James.

01:16:10.279 --> 01:16:12.197
Where have you two been hiding?

01:16:12.239 --> 01:16:13.991
I've been looking all over.

01:16:14.032 --> 01:16:16.201
- I got you a card.
- Ah.

01:16:16.493 --> 01:16:18.871
How sweet of you.

01:16:19.788 --> 01:16:21.415
Not surprised you've been lying low,

01:16:21.456 --> 01:16:23.625
with all that council nonsense
as well.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:25.752
Council nonsense?

01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:28.964
Here.

01:16:29.798 --> 01:16:31.800
Oh! Thank you.

01:16:32.301 --> 01:16:34.344
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Yeah.

01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:40.601
Oh, Irene, that's too kind.

01:16:40.642 --> 01:16:44.146
Look, Bob. Bob, look. Your own bed.

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:47.191
I don't know what to say.
I feel awful. This is, erm...

01:16:48.483 --> 01:16:51.153
You really have no idea, do you?

01:16:53.488 --> 01:16:54.990
- See?
- There he is.

01:16:56.658 --> 01:16:58.952
- Merry Christmas, James.
- Thank you.

01:16:58.994 --> 01:17:01.413
- It's all right.
- It's really kind of you.

01:17:01.455 --> 01:17:02.497
Merry Christmas, James.

01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:03.999
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

01:17:04.041 --> 01:17:05.167
Merry Christmas, James.

01:17:05.209 --> 01:17:06.585
Merry Christmas,
Bob and James.

01:17:06.627 --> 01:17:08.295
Merry Christmas, my love.

01:17:08.337 --> 01:17:10.589
- Merry Christmas.
- Where have you all come from?

01:17:10.631 --> 01:17:12.299
Thank you.

01:17:12.341 --> 01:17:14.635
Wow. Thank you.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.595
- Happy Christmas.
- Thank you so much.

01:17:17.095 --> 01:17:19.515
- I don't know what to say.
- Happy Christmas, James.

01:17:19.556 --> 01:17:22.476
All right, mate.
Got a little surprise for you.

01:17:22.518 --> 01:17:25.062
This is for Bob.

01:17:25.395 --> 01:17:27.814
And that is panda from China.

01:17:27.856 --> 01:17:29.441
Thank you so much.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.819
- Look, Bob. Look.
- Doesn't he look lovely?

01:17:32.861 --> 01:17:34.279
What you do think?
You like it?

01:17:34.321 --> 01:17:35.781
- It's very kind of you.
- Right, follow me.

01:17:37.741 --> 01:17:38.992
Thank you.

01:17:39.743 --> 01:17:40.744
James.

01:17:42.037 --> 01:17:43.205
Mick.

01:17:44.331 --> 01:17:49.294
This is my daughter, Maisie,
and this is my grandson, Michael.

01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.422
Wow. Michael, look at you.

01:17:55.384 --> 01:17:58.053
That thing you said to me in the pub,
you know, made me think, and, er...

01:18:00.597 --> 01:18:01.765
Here we are.

01:18:04.977 --> 01:18:06.019
Thanks.

01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:23.036
Over my dead body.

01:18:24.371 --> 01:18:26.498
- Let me handle this.
- Fine.

01:18:26.540 --> 01:18:30.335
If you could all just give me
a moment, just to speak to James.

01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:33.714
Yeah.

01:18:34.381 --> 01:18:37.509
- Can you keep hold of Bob?
- Yes. Yes, of course.

01:18:39.469 --> 01:18:40.679
You'll be all right, Bob.

01:18:42.764 --> 01:18:44.600
You really should
switch your phone on.

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.143
Might have avoided all this.

01:18:46.602 --> 01:18:49.104
It's been a difficult few days.

01:18:49.146 --> 01:18:50.439
For all of us.

01:18:51.231 --> 01:18:55.319
Anyhow, we've been speaking
to people, evaluating your case.

01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.945
So have I, and, erm...

01:18:59.239 --> 01:19:01.533
- I think I've decided that...
- Wait.

01:19:03.285 --> 01:19:04.286
Do you know what these are?

01:19:06.205 --> 01:19:09.416
Letters, notes, cards, emails...

01:19:10.375 --> 01:19:12.878
"I'd just lost my husband of 40 years.

01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:14.838
"The curtains were still drawn
from the funeral.

01:19:15.255 --> 01:19:17.716
"But when James let me
spend a few minutes with Bob,

01:19:17.758 --> 01:19:20.052
"it gave me a reason
to draw back the curtains.

01:19:20.594 --> 01:19:23.388
"You could say they've let the light
back into my life."

01:19:24.681 --> 01:19:28.644
There's an online petition too.
800 signatures in less than 24 hours.

01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:30.687
What? Who...

01:19:30.729 --> 01:19:34.733
Er, under the name MoodyMo12?

01:19:39.112 --> 01:19:42.241
That's, that's all amazing,
but, erm...

01:19:43.867 --> 01:19:45.744
I know you'll look after him,

01:19:46.370 --> 01:19:49.623
and, erm, I know it's for the best.

01:19:49.665 --> 01:19:52.417
James. No.

01:19:53.252 --> 01:19:55.003
You don't understand.

01:19:56.463 --> 01:19:58.006
You belong together.

01:19:58.423 --> 01:20:00.551
We're not looking after him. You are.

01:20:03.554 --> 01:20:05.806
I... I don't know what to say.

01:20:05.848 --> 01:20:07.307
There's something else.

01:20:07.724 --> 01:20:10.644
A charity, Inspirational Animals.

01:20:10.978 --> 01:20:13.480
Uh, they work with therapy animals.

01:20:13.522 --> 01:20:15.190
They visit people in hospitals.

01:20:15.232 --> 01:20:18.151
They want you and Bob
to be paid ambassadors.

01:20:19.486 --> 01:20:20.571
What?

01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:23.115
Really?

01:20:23.949 --> 01:20:25.033
What?

01:20:26.743 --> 01:20:28.036
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:20:28.871 --> 01:20:31.790
Might come in handy
when Bob visits the hospitals.

01:20:34.209 --> 01:20:35.252
Thank you.

01:20:35.294 --> 01:20:36.712
Think you're so bloody clever,
don't you?

01:20:37.629 --> 01:20:40.048
Oh. I've got...

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:43.218
For all you've done.

01:20:44.928 --> 01:20:47.723
James. Did I miss anything?

01:20:50.058 --> 01:20:51.268
I get to keep him.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.103
You get to keep him.

The butter maker.
You reap what you sow.

01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:33.685
- Except you left out a bit.
- Did I?

01:21:34.102 --> 01:21:36.438
Sometimes you don't even know
you've got seeds to sow.

01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:38.106
Well, we all have those.

01:22:12.599 --> 01:22:14.351
Thank you.

01:22:19.731 --> 01:22:20.816
Hey.

01:22:25.529 --> 01:22:28.448
- Merry Christmas.

01:22:28.490 --> 01:22:30.367
Merry Christmas.

01:22:30.409 --> 01:22:31.869
Look, Bob. Snow.

01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:33.787
Happy Christmas.

01:22:54.391 --> 01:22:56.768
Bob. Try a bit of this.

01:22:57.769 --> 01:22:59.813
- Good boy.
- See you soon. Yeah, bye.

01:23:01.523 --> 01:23:02.816
He's almost back.

01:23:03.233 --> 01:23:04.902
Yeah? Hey.

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:10.199
- Something smells good.
- Ben.

01:23:10.449 --> 01:23:12.743
- How did it go? Yeah?
- Amazing.

01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:14.912
Could have sold 'em all,
but I kept one back for you.

01:23:15.204 --> 01:23:18.457
- Wow. Look at that.
- Best-selling issue of the year.

01:23:18.498 --> 01:23:20.083
I've gotta show him. There he is.

01:23:20.542 --> 01:23:21.752
- Look at this, mate.
- Hi, Ben.

01:23:21.793 --> 01:23:23.754
- How you doing?
- Look. Cover star.

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:26.465
Hey, look. What do you think?

01:23:26.715 --> 01:23:28.800
Look, Bob? Do you like it?

01:23:30.010 --> 01:23:33.805
I'm gonna put it up here, OK?
Pride of place on the mantelpiece.

01:23:35.015 --> 01:23:37.017
- Right, drinks. Drinks.
- Drinks.

01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.561
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

01:23:39.603 --> 01:23:41.480
- To Christmas.
- Oh! Quick. It's starting.

Thank you.

01:24:46.795 --> 01:24:47.838
Mm.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.174
Me and Bob were thinking
we might play charades later.

01:24:50.507 --> 01:24:51.717
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

01:24:51.758 --> 01:24:52.759
We should start thinking of some.

01:24:52.801 --> 01:24:54.469
I don't know how I can ever thank you.

01:24:54.511 --> 01:24:56.096
You don't need to thank me.

01:24:56.138 --> 01:24:57.514
I've started work on the new book.

01:24:57.806 --> 01:24:59.558
If I hadn't met you,
I'd never have thought of it.

01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:01.894
- Thought of what?
- What to write.

01:25:01.935 --> 01:25:05.480
Actually, I've got
a little gift for you.

01:25:05.522 --> 01:25:07.816
Happy Christmas.

01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:19.494
Ah, mate. Ah, this is so cool.

01:25:19.536 --> 01:25:20.746
It's from me and Bob.

01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:23.707
- Thank you.
- It's all right.

01:25:33.550 --> 01:25:37.012
I didn't know what to get you,
and then I remembered your nan's tree

and the messages about Christmas

01:25:40.057 --> 01:25:42.017
