00:38.386 --> 00:40.127
Can you get these
downtown for me?

00:45.132 --> 00:46.412
Hey, we don't allow
dogs in here.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.442
I'm here to report
my wife missing.

00:53.531 --> 00:55.814
Your name?

00:55.838 --> 00:57.729
My name is Robert Durst.

00:57.753 --> 00:58.643
Your wife's name?

00:58.667 --> 00:59.992
Kathie.

01:00.016 --> 01:01.602
Or Kathleen.

01:01.626 --> 01:03.952
What makes you think
she's missing?

01:03.976 --> 01:06.738
I have not heard from
my wife in five days.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.261
- Five days?
- Yeah.

01:08.285 --> 01:10.437
Which is not completely unusual.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.700
My wife is very busy
with medical school.

01:12.724 --> 01:14.398
The last time I saw her

01:14.422 --> 01:17.401
was at our lake house
in South Salem.

01:17.425 --> 01:18.532
We had...

01:18.556 --> 01:20.926
an argument,

01:20.950 --> 01:23.624
and she asked to go on a
train back to Manhattan,

01:23.648 --> 01:25.148
so I put her on one.

01:25.172 --> 01:27.019
The last time we spoke
was later that night

01:27.043 --> 01:30.414
when she got home
to the apartment.

01:30.438 --> 01:31.371
How's your marriage?

01:31.395 --> 01:33.093
It's fine.

01:34.964 --> 01:37.029
My wife has a drinking problem.

01:37.053 --> 01:39.316
She saw a therapist for a while.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.208
She stopped that, too.

01:42.232 --> 01:45.907
Okay, uh, we're gonna
need phone numbers

01:45.931 --> 01:47.171
for your immediate relatives...

01:47.195 --> 01:48.195
I don't have any of them.

01:49.631 --> 01:51.304
What do you do, Mr. Durst?

01:51.328 --> 01:53.263
I am in real estate.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.899
My father is...

01:59.336 --> 02:00.381
Seymour Durst.

02:05.429 --> 02:06.754
How about a photo of your wife?

02:06.778 --> 02:07.886
Yeah.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.583
Sit down.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.348
Sit down.

02:18.964 --> 02:19.964
Okay.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.509
All right.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.164
Fill that out.

02:25.188 --> 02:29.951
For an official missing
persons investigation,

02:29.975 --> 02:30.952
you've gotta meet some criteria.

02:30.976 --> 02:32.476
You're not there yet.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.826
I'll make a few calls
and get back to you.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.393
In the meantime,
if you hear from

02:36.417 --> 02:37.263
or you see your wife,

02:37.287 --> 02:38.482
you give us a call.

02:38.506 --> 02:40.203
Okay.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.364
We running a kennel now, Struk?

02:50.321 --> 02:51.321
Who was that?

02:51.345 --> 02:52.345
A rich asshole.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.046
Just came in to file a
missing persons on his wife.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.634
Sounds like a runaway
spouse situation.

03:00.658 --> 03:01.592
What was the guy's name?

03:01.616 --> 03:02.593
Durst.

03:02.617 --> 03:03.855
Robert Durst.

03:03.879 --> 03:04.812
Real estate.

03:04.836 --> 03:05.881
Durst?

03:07.317 --> 03:09.189
His family owns
half of Manhattan.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.000
Good evening, Mr. Durst.

03:19.024 --> 03:20.765
Good evening, Edward.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.181
Is Mrs. Durst coming?

03:26.293 --> 03:28.382
I don't know.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.555
Hello?

03:51.579 --> 03:53.905
Jim, it's Bob.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.994
Hey, Bob. How are ya?

03:56.018 --> 03:58.736
I just got back from
the police station.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.457
Police station?

04:01.850 --> 04:03.567
I just reported Kathie missing.

04:03.591 --> 04:05.133
Bob, I don't understand.

04:05.157 --> 04:06.222
I have to go now, Jimmy.

04:06.246 --> 04:07.135
I'm sorry.

04:07.159 --> 04:08.180
Bob...

04:08.204 --> 04:09.747
Call me if you see
Kathie, please

04:09.771 --> 04:10.574
No, Bob...

04:10.598 --> 04:12.817
Bob? Bob...

04:20.172 --> 04:21.628
All right. Are you good?

04:21.652 --> 04:22.629
Yeah.

04:22.653 --> 04:23.891
It's actually not that heavy,

04:23.915 --> 04:24.849
don't you think?

04:24.873 --> 04:26.329
Yeah, you got the light end.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.287
Okay, so it's just
on my left here.

04:28.311 --> 04:29.767
- Okay.
- Yup.

04:29.791 --> 04:30.724
- Your left?
- Uh-huh.

04:30.748 --> 04:31.748
Okay...

04:34.709 --> 04:35.816
Okay.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.601
What do you think?

04:37.625 --> 04:39.342
I'm gonna paint the
whole place yellow.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.455
What a surprise.
Your favorite color.

04:43.695 --> 04:44.695
You gonna be okay

04:44.719 --> 04:45.826
all alone in the big city?

04:45.850 --> 04:46.871
Oh, Jimmy.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.176
I'm not a kid anymore.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.352
I'll be fine.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.005
Yeah, I know, I'm just...

04:51.029 --> 04:52.572
New York's an expensive place

04:52.596 --> 04:53.636
for a dental receptionist.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.619
I know. I'll manage.

04:55.643 --> 04:56.837
I'll budget.

04:56.861 --> 04:58.056
You don't have to worry.

04:58.080 --> 04:59.710
Oh, here,

04:59.734 --> 05:00.934
can you take this down for me?

05:00.958 --> 05:02.365
Yes.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.410
Of course, I'm gonna
worry about you.

05:04.434 --> 05:06.325
I'm your brother, that's my job.

05:06.349 --> 05:07.979
I know, but how about
you don't anymore?

05:08.003 --> 05:09.633
No promises.

05:09.657 --> 05:10.634
I'll see you later.

05:10.658 --> 05:13.550
Okay, see you later.

05:13.574 --> 05:14.551
Thanks for your help.

05:14.575 --> 05:16.074
You got it.

05:49.326 --> 05:50.326
Oh!

05:50.350 --> 05:51.805
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

05:51.829 --> 05:52.763
I didn't see you.

05:52.787 --> 05:54.658
Yeah, apparently not.

05:55.680 --> 05:56.680
You can let go now.

05:56.704 --> 05:57.681
Oh.

05:57.705 --> 05:58.812
Yeah.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.423
I'm not usually that clumsy.

06:00.447 --> 06:02.729
Yeah, I'm not usually
that elegant.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.169
You're new in the
building, I guess.

06:08.193 --> 06:10.520
So, welcome to the building.

06:10.544 --> 06:11.608
Oh.

06:11.632 --> 06:12.696
Wow.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.808
Oh, you like 'em?

06:14.852 --> 06:15.873
Are those Earth Shoes?

06:15.897 --> 06:17.048
They are.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.005
Do they feel like you're
falling backwards

06:18.029 --> 06:19.050
when you walk?

06:19.074 --> 06:20.138
They make me feel like

06:20.162 --> 06:22.270
I'm climbing an
endless mountain.

06:23.861 --> 06:25.012
You're funny.

06:26.342 --> 06:30.148
Then she thinks to
herself, "This guy's odd."

06:30.172 --> 06:31.956
"He's incredibly
charming, but he's odd."

06:33.218 --> 06:34.718
How did you know
what I was thinking?

06:34.742 --> 06:36.265
Intuition, I guess.

06:39.703 --> 06:41.246
Welcome to the building.

06:41.270 --> 06:42.270
Thanks.

06:43.446 --> 06:45.598
Okay, well, I'm gonna go now.

06:45.622 --> 06:46.817
Yeah, you should...

06:46.841 --> 06:47.841
get out of here...

06:50.540 --> 06:51.735
Unit 52,

06:51.759 --> 06:53.084
please respond to a 3-11

06:53.108 --> 06:55.371
at West 45th Street
and 12th Avenue.

06:57.742 --> 06:58.742
What's your name?

06:58.766 --> 07:00.483
Edward Michaels.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.962
Okay, I'm gonna have to ask you

07:01.986 --> 07:03.442
a couple of questions, Edward.

07:03.466 --> 07:04.356
Yes, sir.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.836
Were you working last Sunday?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.490
Till 6:00 a.m.

07:07.514 --> 07:08.834
Did you see Mrs.
Durst that night?

07:08.858 --> 07:09.970
I did.

07:09.994 --> 07:11.407
What time did you see her?

07:11.431 --> 07:13.104
Uh... it was about 11:00.

07:13.128 --> 07:14.845
Was she alone?

07:14.869 --> 07:16.000
Yeah.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.333
You remember if anybody else
came to see her that night?

07:20.357 --> 07:21.329
No.

07:21.353 --> 07:24.507
She's always coming
and going by herself.

07:24.531 --> 07:26.531
Her and Mr. Durst, I hardly
ever see them together.

07:26.555 --> 07:27.379
Okay.

07:27.403 --> 07:29.536
Thank you, Edward.

07:39.676 --> 07:41.461
Oh, it's open.

07:42.592 --> 07:44.048
Oh...

07:44.072 --> 07:46.093
H-hi.

07:46.117 --> 07:47.225
Oh, boy,

07:47.249 --> 07:49.532
that's a lot of yellow.

07:49.556 --> 07:51.359
I like things bright.

07:51.383 --> 07:52.709
Yeah, you definitely do.

07:52.733 --> 07:55.233
Blinding, I would... say.

07:55.257 --> 07:57.540
Um, can I help you?
Or are you...

07:57.564 --> 07:59.106
Yeah, I'm here for the rent.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.730
The rent? Do you work
for the building...

08:00.754 --> 08:01.805
I own the building.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.197
Oh.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.939
Well, my family owns the...
building, and um...

08:05.963 --> 08:06.940
Oh, this is so awkward.

08:06.964 --> 08:07.854
No, no, it-it's okay...

08:07.878 --> 08:08.681
What I meant to say is...

08:08.705 --> 08:09.639
It's okay, I'll go get it.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.249
God...

08:11.273 --> 08:12.903
So, my place is kinda messy,

08:12.927 --> 08:14.165
and I can't find a pen...

08:14.189 --> 08:15.886
Would you like to
have lunch with me?

08:18.367 --> 08:21.520
Um... you mean...

08:21.544 --> 08:23.043
now?

08:23.067 --> 08:24.349
Yeah.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.612
I-I'm not dressed.

08:26.636 --> 08:28.745
Neither am I...

08:32.163 --> 08:33.924
Oh...

08:33.948 --> 08:35.011
is that the mayor?

08:35.035 --> 08:36.035
Unfortunately, yeah.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.539
My family has a table

08:40.563 --> 08:42.498
right over there in that corner.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.587
For two today, thank
you, Maurice.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.457
I'm sorry, Mr. Durst.

08:45.481 --> 08:46.893
You know we have a dress code.

08:46.917 --> 08:49.287
But I can offer you
a jacket and a tie.

08:49.311 --> 08:51.158
I don't want a tie.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.421
I want lunch.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.336
You know the rules, Mr. Durst.

08:55.360 --> 08:57.513
Well, that's okay, we can go...

08:57.537 --> 08:59.558
No, no, no, we're not gonna go.

08:59.582 --> 09:01.299
I can see one right
in here, Maurice.

09:01.323 --> 09:02.518
Mr. Durst...

09:02.542 --> 09:03.431
That's right.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.849
That's my name.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.941
If you'd just take the jacket.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.599
Let's just... let's just go.

09:18.209 --> 09:19.209
Let's go.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.191
See, this is more like it.

09:24.215 --> 09:27.238
We got beautiful scenery,

09:27.262 --> 09:29.109
we got nobody telling
us what to do...

09:29.133 --> 09:30.807
Did I tell you that I opened

09:30.831 --> 09:32.635
a health food store in Vermont?

09:32.659 --> 09:33.940
Really?

09:33.964 --> 09:35.420
Yeah, yeah, I did.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.161
I got homemade granola,

09:37.185 --> 09:39.642
I got sunflower seeds, I got...

09:39.666 --> 09:42.340
You don't seem
like a health nut.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.342
Yeah, you're not the first
person in the world

09:44.366 --> 09:45.517
to say that.

09:45.541 --> 09:48.389
My father hates the
whole idea, too.

09:48.413 --> 09:50.261
He wants to see me
in a suit and tie,

09:50.285 --> 09:51.436
but you know what,

09:51.460 --> 09:54.091
that is my father.

09:54.115 --> 09:55.309
That's him, not me,

09:55.333 --> 09:56.659
you know what I mean, right?

09:56.683 --> 09:58.965
Actually, I don't.

09:58.989 --> 10:01.122
I lost my father years ago.

10:03.559 --> 10:06.344
I watched my mother die.

10:08.912 --> 10:11.978
It was a horrible accident.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.048
I'm so sorry.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.227
She was magic.

10:22.686 --> 10:23.686
You know, my father,

10:23.710 --> 10:24.687
he's got all these buildings,

10:24.711 --> 10:26.776
and he makes these speeches

10:26.800 --> 10:28.560
about how he wants to
clean up Times Square,

10:28.584 --> 10:30.823
but I'm telling you, it's...

10:30.847 --> 10:32.259
The place is a dump.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.479
It's all filled with
like, hookers and pimps.

10:34.503 --> 10:35.741
In my opinion,

10:35.765 --> 10:37.787
the whole place has
gone to the dogs.

10:37.811 --> 10:41.205
Just... to the dogs.

10:50.737 --> 10:51.844
Ruff.

10:53.847 --> 10:54.847
Ruff...

10:54.871 --> 10:56.457
I like the sound of your dog.

10:56.481 --> 10:59.659
That's about as
vicious as it gets.

11:01.289 --> 11:02.289
Sure you don't want any?

11:02.313 --> 11:04.185
No.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.040
Do they have to do all that?

11:14.064 --> 11:16.042
Standard procedure.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.914
She was seen here last.

11:17.938 --> 11:19.178
Let's go over that night again.

11:19.202 --> 11:21.117
Again?

11:22.638 --> 11:24.137
Um, okay.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.356
Well, we had an argument,

11:25.380 --> 11:26.444
as I told you.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.141
Your arguments
ever get physical?

11:28.165 --> 11:29.142
No.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.102
Never.

11:32.126 --> 11:33.669
And you spoke to her later?

11:33.693 --> 11:35.975
Yes, I called her from
a payphone on Route 35

11:35.999 --> 11:37.542
just to see that she was okay.

11:37.566 --> 11:39.675
That's pretty far from
your house, isn't it?

11:39.699 --> 11:42.373
I was walking my dog.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.854
And you didn't speak
to her the next day?

11:44.878 --> 11:47.595
No, sir, I had some
properties to inspect

11:47.619 --> 11:48.771
in Connecticut.

11:51.319 --> 11:52.818
Okay.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.080
Well, thanks for your time.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.019
Thank you.

11:59.066 --> 12:00.652
Do you ever call first?

12:00.676 --> 12:01.895
Only collect.

12:03.548 --> 12:07.528
So, I tried to find one
in a blinding yellow,

12:07.552 --> 12:08.712
but this is all I could find.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.795
Yeah...?

12:12.819 --> 12:14.168
Put it on.

12:16.605 --> 12:17.605
The place we're going...

12:18.825 --> 12:21.238
serious dress code.

12:37.037 --> 12:38.037
Did you see that?

12:38.061 --> 12:39.822
Oh, yeah.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.650
I didn't know there were
restaurants like this.

12:42.674 --> 12:44.087
Yeah, it's Manhattan.

12:44.111 --> 12:45.329
They got everything.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.179
Everything.

12:49.203 --> 12:50.180
Who's that?

12:50.204 --> 12:51.137
That was...

12:51.161 --> 12:52.791
that was Prudence Farrow.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.576
She's, uh... Mia
Farrow's sister.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.160
You know how John
Lennon wrote that song

12:57.184 --> 12:59.839
"Dear Prudence"? It's about her.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.237
So, what is it that you do, hmm?

13:04.261 --> 13:07.588
Um, I'm a dental
assistant for now.

13:07.612 --> 13:09.112
So you like to see
people in pain?

13:09.136 --> 13:10.983
No.

13:11.007 --> 13:12.028
It's a desk job.

13:12.052 --> 13:14.073
It's a job to pay my bills.

13:14.097 --> 13:15.417
But someday, I want
to be a nurse.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.600
You know, I'm feeling a
little under the weather,

13:19.624 --> 13:21.472
you think you could
take care of me?

13:21.496 --> 13:22.821
Where does it hurt?

13:22.845 --> 13:23.845
Everywhere.

13:33.725 --> 13:35.181
You're easy to talk to.

13:35.205 --> 13:36.748
You are, too.

13:36.772 --> 13:38.445
That's not true, at all.

13:38.469 --> 13:41.037
I appreciate the
compliment, though.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.975
You should come
with me to Vermont.

13:45.999 --> 13:47.367
What?

13:47.391 --> 13:48.499
You should come
with me to Vermont.

13:48.523 --> 13:49.683
You don't want to do this job

13:49.707 --> 13:51.023
that you're talking about,

13:51.047 --> 13:52.416
and I think you could come
to the store with me.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.113
We could work together, and...

13:54.137 --> 13:55.723
- Yeah.
- You're serious.

13:55.747 --> 13:56.899
I'm serious, yeah.

13:56.923 --> 13:58.117
Listen to me,

13:58.141 --> 14:00.467
this place has got to
be seen to be believed.

14:00.491 --> 14:01.686
I mean, it's beautiful.

14:01.710 --> 14:03.688
Not as beautiful as
you are, of course.

14:03.712 --> 14:04.863
But honestly...

14:04.887 --> 14:05.887
It's happening.

14:07.455 --> 14:09.302
I... I can't.

14:09.326 --> 14:10.434
Why not?

14:10.458 --> 14:11.478
'Cause I'm just
starting a life here.

14:11.502 --> 14:12.782
Okay, so start a
new one with me.

14:12.806 --> 14:14.612
We go and be hippies
together in Vermont.

14:14.636 --> 14:16.222
We can grow our own food,

14:16.246 --> 14:17.846
we can have nobody
telling us what to do.

14:17.870 --> 14:19.095
You know what,

14:19.119 --> 14:20.357
we can walk around naked
together if we wanted,

14:20.381 --> 14:21.981
and John Lennon can
write songs about us,

14:22.005 --> 14:23.005
how about that?

14:23.950 --> 14:25.734
We'll live.

14:26.691 --> 14:28.626
Well, think about it.

14:28.650 --> 14:29.912
You think about it.

14:48.670 --> 14:50.367
Come on. Here we go.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.177
Thank you.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.483
For what?

15:00.508 --> 15:02.138
The flowers.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.860
Oh, I think those
are for the dog.

15:14.739 --> 15:16.935
I feel so free up here.

15:16.959 --> 15:18.763
Yeah. Me too.

15:18.787 --> 15:20.627
It's a little better with
you here, I will say.

15:20.651 --> 15:22.847
Just a little.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.928
Hi.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.344
I'm so sorry.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.687
So sad.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.690
Ugh, it's depressing,

16:16.714 --> 16:18.978
and not good for business.

16:24.548 --> 16:26.352
Igor!

16:26.376 --> 16:27.310
Igor!

16:27.334 --> 16:28.485
Igor!

16:29.945 --> 16:31.227
We'll never find him like this.

16:31.251 --> 16:33.142
He'll come back.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.317
Igor!

16:34.341 --> 16:35.361
Igor!

16:35.385 --> 16:36.493
Igor!

16:36.517 --> 16:38.234
Igor!

16:40.390 --> 16:41.672
Stop it, Bobby.

16:44.438 --> 16:46.111
Bobby, stop it.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.199
Stop it!

16:48.181 --> 16:49.332
It's not funny!

16:49.356 --> 16:51.508
You're not a dog.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.532
I was trying to...

16:56.145 --> 16:57.340
It's okay.

16:57.364 --> 16:58.906
I get it.

16:58.930 --> 16:59.930
I understand.

17:53.246 --> 17:54.571
Bobby?

17:54.595 --> 17:56.162
I don't have to do nothing.

17:59.513 --> 18:01.428
Bobby...

18:03.038 --> 18:05.693
Hey, what's wrong?

18:09.610 --> 18:11.655
It's my father.

18:13.570 --> 18:16.269
He wants me to go work for
him back in New York.

18:18.662 --> 18:19.900
You don't have to, do you?

18:19.924 --> 18:21.859
"Have to..." Kathie,
it's not about have to,

18:21.883 --> 18:23.034
it's about need,

18:23.058 --> 18:24.470
and I need that money of his.

18:24.494 --> 18:25.776
You don't need the money.

18:25.800 --> 18:27.038
You can stay here...

18:27.062 --> 18:28.582
Sweetheart, you don't
understand, okay?

18:28.606 --> 18:30.476
Without that guy, I'm
gonna be cut off,

18:30.500 --> 18:32.261
and without him, I have nothing.

18:32.285 --> 18:34.330
I have nothing.

18:35.462 --> 18:38.117
You have me.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.380
Right?

18:47.822 --> 18:51.410
Struk, check out what
I found out, man.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.368
The wife Kathie,

18:52.392 --> 18:53.978
she had a divorce lawyer.

18:54.002 --> 18:55.922
Apparently, Durst wouldn't
agree to a settlement,

18:55.946 --> 18:57.242
even though he's worth millions.

18:57.266 --> 18:58.896
Wouldn't even give her 400,000.

18:58.920 --> 19:00.854
And then there's the dogs.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.770
There's like five or six dogs
that died or disappeared on him.

19:03.794 --> 19:07.644
How do six of your dogs
disappear suddenly?

19:07.668 --> 19:10.777
We gotta get the phone
records for his apartment

19:10.801 --> 19:12.388
and his office at
Durst headquarters.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.215
I'll call the D.A.

19:13.239 --> 19:14.303
Oh, hey, uh,

19:14.327 --> 19:16.305
I think you got some visitors.

19:16.329 --> 19:18.263
Is anyone going to talk to us?

19:18.287 --> 19:19.527
Come on, you'd better hurry up.

19:19.551 --> 19:20.918
What is happening?

19:20.942 --> 19:21.875
Seriously, this is not a
missing persons case,

19:21.899 --> 19:23.139
this is a murder investigation!

19:23.163 --> 19:25.444
Why hasn't Bobby
Durst been arrested?

19:25.468 --> 19:27.403
How do you all know Kathie?

19:27.427 --> 19:28.882
We went to nursing
school together.

19:28.906 --> 19:30.145
I'm Gilberte Najamy.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.809
This is Ellen Strauss
and Eleanor Schwank.

19:31.833 --> 19:33.060
We're her best friends.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.410
Why has no one talked to us?

19:34.434 --> 19:35.715
Yeah, it's complete
incompetence.

19:35.739 --> 19:36.716
Yeah!

19:36.740 --> 19:37.717
We're investigating.

19:37.741 --> 19:38.762
Investigating what?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.242
Isn't it obvious that he did it?

19:40.266 --> 19:41.504
Have you traced their calls?

19:41.528 --> 19:42.505
We're waiting on those records.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.984
It's been a month.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.551
Ladies, we're doing
everything we can.

19:45.575 --> 19:46.639
Oh, come on, Kathie was afraid
that Bobby would kill her.

19:46.663 --> 19:47.988
Yeah.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.730
Have you even searched
their South Salem house?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.514
No, because my jurisdiction
is New York City,

19:52.538 --> 19:53.738
where she was last seen alive.

19:53.762 --> 19:55.561
No, she was never
even in New York.

19:55.585 --> 19:57.745
We have a witness who says
he saw her at the penthouse.

19:57.769 --> 19:59.478
No, I don't believe it.

19:59.502 --> 20:01.001
I was on that train for days,

20:01.025 --> 20:02.046
handing out her picture,

20:02.070 --> 20:02.742
asking if anyone had seen her,

20:02.766 --> 20:04.091
and nobody did.

20:04.115 --> 20:05.963
And look,

20:05.987 --> 20:07.027
I found this in his trash.

20:08.511 --> 20:09.923
You went through his garbage?

20:09.947 --> 20:11.011
Yeah, I did.

20:11.035 --> 20:12.230
The day I knew she was gone.

20:12.254 --> 20:13.231
You realize what you were doing?

20:13.255 --> 20:14.450
Uh, yeah, I do.

20:14.474 --> 20:15.779
I'm doing your job.

20:19.870 --> 20:21.718
"10:00 a.m. Ridgefield coffee."

20:21.742 --> 20:23.850
2:00 p.m. Bought boots.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.852
"Tuesday, 7:00 a.m.
South Salem..."

20:25.876 --> 20:28.464
This is an itinerary.

20:28.488 --> 20:29.619
Yeah. For an alibi.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.435
He was throwing out her
letters, unopened,

20:33.459 --> 20:35.461
the day after she disappeared.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.680
Oh, my...

20:47.985 --> 20:49.465
Bob, this is where you grew up?

20:55.384 --> 20:57.188
Let's have a toast.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.495
My sons...

20:59.519 --> 21:01.932
It's good to have you home.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.021
There is a, um...

21:04.045 --> 21:07.154
a traditional order to things.

21:07.178 --> 21:10.027
My father passed this
company on to me.

21:10.051 --> 21:14.771
One day, I will
pass it on to you.

21:14.795 --> 21:16.686
In order for me to do that,

21:16.710 --> 21:19.950
you will learn the
business as I did,

21:19.974 --> 21:21.497
from the bottom up.

21:22.933 --> 21:23.997
But first,

21:24.021 --> 21:26.217
go get your hair cut.

21:26.241 --> 21:28.306
This foolishness ends now.

21:28.330 --> 21:32.484
You look like a
gaggle of dropouts.

21:34.510 --> 21:35.661
Pardon me.

21:35.685 --> 21:37.184
- Jesus, Bobby.
- What?

21:41.038 --> 21:43.476
Thank you, Pop. Thank you.

21:46.217 --> 21:49.022
We've been humpin' this
case for over a month.

21:49.046 --> 21:50.154
The Durst family putting
any pressure on the Chief

21:50.178 --> 21:51.547
to find this girl?

21:51.571 --> 21:53.331
No one told me to
find her or lay off.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.985
If I'm Seymour Durst,

21:55.009 --> 21:57.329
I'd be doing everything I could
to find my daughter-in-law.

21:57.353 --> 21:58.554
The guy hasn't done shit.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.207
Maybe they didn't like her.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.166
Hey, you got those
phone records yet?

22:02.190 --> 22:03.950
No, I don't know
what's taking so long.

22:03.974 --> 22:04.995
What about Durst?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.605
He stopped returning my calls.

22:06.629 --> 22:08.651
Wanna get him in for a poly?

22:08.675 --> 22:10.609
We could try.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.829
I'm looking for Detective Struk.

22:12.853 --> 22:13.830
Speaking.

22:13.854 --> 22:15.658
This is Attorney Nick Scoppetta.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.312
I've been retained
by Robert Durst.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.536
All calls concerning my client

22:18.560 --> 22:19.493
will now go through me.

22:19.517 --> 22:20.663
Good.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.447
I got a few things I'd
like to ask Mr. Durst.

22:22.471 --> 22:23.274
Me first.

22:23.298 --> 22:24.754
Are you going to
arrest my client?

22:24.778 --> 22:26.277
No, but I'd like to
talk to him some more.

22:26.301 --> 22:27.147
Mr. Durst would like to help,

22:27.171 --> 22:28.192
but he's very busy.

22:28.216 --> 22:29.456
There's nothing more he can add

22:29.480 --> 22:30.239
to what he's already told you.

22:30.263 --> 22:31.500
How about a poly?

22:31.524 --> 22:32.588
A polygraph?

22:32.612 --> 22:33.892
Are you seriously
asking me that?

22:33.916 --> 22:35.025
I did, just now.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.331
My client has done nothing

22:36.355 --> 22:38.289
to warrant such an
invasion of his privacy.

22:38.313 --> 22:40.030
You have any questions,
you call me.

22:40.054 --> 22:41.185
Yeah.

22:44.232 --> 22:48.038
Durst just lawyered up.

23:02.163 --> 23:04.141
Hello, Kathie.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.361
Hi.

23:06.385 --> 23:09.886
Your home is...
really beautiful.

23:09.910 --> 23:12.018
It's mixed emotions here.

23:12.042 --> 23:13.280
We moved into this house

23:13.304 --> 23:14.584
after the suicide of our mother.

23:15.524 --> 23:16.806
Suicide?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.440
I thought she fell.

23:20.288 --> 23:21.288
Oh, I'm...

23:21.312 --> 23:23.856
I didn't know, I'm sorry.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.555
You seem like a nice girl.

23:26.579 --> 23:27.991
Are you happy with Bob?

23:28.015 --> 23:29.122
Is everything okay?

23:29.146 --> 23:30.210
Yeah.

23:30.234 --> 23:31.690
He's great.

23:31.714 --> 23:33.039
Vermont was great.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.694
You know, he didn't
want to come back here.

23:35.718 --> 23:37.130
Well, Bob can be odd.

23:37.154 --> 23:39.194
You never know with him,
what's real and what isn't.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.657
Do you know where he is?

23:41.681 --> 23:43.615
Uh, yeah, he had to
go away somewhere

23:43.639 --> 23:45.269
for a few days.

23:45.293 --> 23:46.453
Never told you where, did he?

23:46.477 --> 23:48.359
No.

23:48.383 --> 23:50.167
He does that.

23:52.343 --> 23:55.346
Just... disappears.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.872
You take care, Kathie.

24:09.163 --> 24:10.163
Hello, Kathie?

24:10.187 --> 24:10.947
Kathie!

24:10.971 --> 24:12.122
Hey!

24:12.146 --> 24:14.341
Yeah! Yeah, the
barbecue's fired up.

24:14.365 --> 24:15.604
We went fishing.

24:15.628 --> 24:16.692
We've been playin' cards.

24:16.716 --> 24:17.649
Ma's cooking up a storm, yeah.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.303
Ah, I'm sure.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.305
It sounds wonderful.

24:21.329 --> 24:22.306
Wish you were here.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.350
On your birthday.

24:23.374 --> 24:25.440
You and Bob havin' a good time?

24:25.464 --> 24:26.702
Yeah.

24:26.726 --> 24:28.268
Yeah, we're great.

24:28.292 --> 24:29.618
Wonderful.

24:29.642 --> 24:31.446
Say hi to the family
for me, okay?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.622
Yeah, sure will.

24:33.646 --> 24:35.493
Happy Birthday, Kathie.

24:35.517 --> 24:36.494
From all of us.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.259
Thanks Jimmy.Bye.

24:45.440 --> 24:48.506
Where have you been?

24:48.530 --> 24:49.725
Uh, business.

24:49.749 --> 24:50.813
For days?

24:50.837 --> 24:51.814
You couldn't have called me?

24:51.838 --> 24:54.164
Well, you know, sweetheart,

24:54.188 --> 24:56.949
sometimes, I just have
to get away from...

24:56.973 --> 24:58.385
them.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.517
You know?

24:59.541 --> 25:01.238
But you know I'm
always here for you.

25:03.589 --> 25:04.981
Always.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.250
You didn't honestly think
that I forgot, did you?

25:09.203 --> 25:11.422
Oh, my God.

25:17.841 --> 25:18.841
What is this?

25:18.865 --> 25:20.431
A collar.

25:22.129 --> 25:23.715
Wait, no, it's a joke.

25:23.739 --> 25:24.586
Honey, it's a joke.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.915
Just wait, wait...

25:30.093 --> 25:32.115
Come on, atta boy.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.159
Who is this?

25:33.183 --> 25:34.160
This is Igor.

25:34.184 --> 25:36.336
What, the same name?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.382
Yeah, the same name.

25:38.406 --> 25:39.846
You love that name,
don't you, buddy?

25:39.870 --> 25:40.602
Igor...

25:40.626 --> 25:41.646
Igor.

25:41.670 --> 25:42.734
Igor the Second?

25:42.758 --> 25:44.118
Well, the Third,
technically, yeah.

25:44.142 --> 25:46.754
The first one got
hit by a car, so...

25:48.068 --> 25:49.524
Well...

25:49.548 --> 25:51.351
I'm glad you're here, Igor.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.769
Happy Birthday, baby.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.477
Come on...

26:12.875 --> 26:15.680
Oh, my gosh...

26:15.704 --> 26:17.334
Oh, my gosh!

26:17.358 --> 26:18.857
You like it?

26:18.881 --> 26:20.250
This is ours?

26:20.274 --> 26:22.208
This is all, all ours, yeah.

26:22.232 --> 26:24.994
This is amazing!

26:25.018 --> 26:26.082
Oh, my...

26:27.281 --> 26:28.911
It's all ours?

26:28.935 --> 26:30.284
It's all ours.

26:37.094 --> 26:38.094
How can I help you?

26:38.118 --> 26:39.008
Susan Berman,

26:39.032 --> 26:40.163
for Robert and Kathie Durst.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.881
Hey, Susan, tell my brother

26:42.905 --> 26:44.491
about some of those
crazy stories.

26:44.515 --> 26:46.668
Oh, okay.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.670
I'm a writer.

26:48.694 --> 26:50.019
Mainly non-fiction.

26:50.043 --> 26:51.542
I started as a reporter,

26:51.566 --> 26:53.239
but now I write
mainly about my life.

26:53.263 --> 26:55.502
My father was a gangster.

26:55.526 --> 26:58.027
So, Suzy's father was Bugsy
Siegel's right hand,

26:58.051 --> 26:59.202
so when Bugsy got whacked,

26:59.226 --> 27:00.682
her father took over
the whole deal,

27:00.706 --> 27:01.683
isn't that right?

27:01.707 --> 27:02.945
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.329
So, how do you two
know each other?

27:04.353 --> 27:06.426
They went to college together.

27:06.450 --> 27:08.298
Yeah, Bobby is my oldest,
very best friend.

27:08.322 --> 27:09.952
I would lay down in
traffic for this guy.

27:12.282 --> 27:14.043
Hmm.

27:14.067 --> 27:16.387
Well, growing up in a mob, that
must have been interesting.

27:16.411 --> 27:17.437
Mm-hmm.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.352
My father was a wonderful man.

27:19.376 --> 27:20.656
I never actually
knew what he did

27:20.680 --> 27:21.659
until I was much older.

27:21.683 --> 27:22.834
But you know,

27:22.858 --> 27:25.271
I didn't exactly have
a normal childhood.

27:25.295 --> 27:26.185
My mother made me
duck in the limo

27:26.209 --> 27:27.249
driving through Las Vegas,

27:27.273 --> 27:28.553
and I could never
understand why.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.712
Oh, Bobby!

27:30.736 --> 27:31.756
Bobby, I didn't tell you.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.100
I went to see a
psychic last week.

27:33.124 --> 27:35.542
She said that I was
gonna die by a bullet.

27:35.566 --> 27:36.848
Can you believe that?

27:36.872 --> 27:38.552
I've always been afraid
of dying violently.

27:38.576 --> 27:39.982
Mm-hmm.

27:40.006 --> 27:41.505
Sounds like your life, Suzy.

27:41.529 --> 27:42.985
What are you talking about?

27:43.009 --> 27:44.726
I should get back
to Long Island.

27:44.750 --> 27:47.070
What, do you gotta get home,
update that tackle box, Jimmy?

27:48.579 --> 27:49.731
That's right, Bob.

27:49.755 --> 27:50.862
That is...

27:50.886 --> 27:52.777
that's exactly right.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.736
Uh, well, it was
nice meeting you.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.128
Look out for my book.

27:56.152 --> 27:58.072
I'm gonna call it, "Easy
Street" by Susan Berman.

27:58.096 --> 27:59.097
What do you think, Bobby?

28:01.244 --> 28:02.265
Okay.

28:02.289 --> 28:03.222
All right.

28:03.246 --> 28:04.397
Thanks for coming.

28:04.421 --> 28:05.861
You're welcome.
Thanks for having me.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.080
She's, uh...

28:07.773 --> 28:09.489
So much.

28:09.513 --> 28:10.795
They're fun, come on.

28:10.819 --> 28:12.499
- All right, I love you.
- I love you, too.

28:15.868 --> 28:17.367
I understand your concern.

28:17.391 --> 28:19.804
Isn't there something
you can do?

28:19.828 --> 28:20.979
We have to be patient.

28:21.003 --> 28:22.720
People don't just disappear.

28:22.744 --> 28:24.330
Can the police be pushed at all?

28:24.354 --> 28:25.794
They don't seem to
be doing anything,

28:25.818 --> 28:27.338
and Bobby doesn't
seem to want to help.

28:27.362 --> 28:28.334
Bobby is very upset.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.422
Oh, is he?

28:29.446 --> 28:30.859
He's got a fine way
of showing it,

28:30.883 --> 28:32.295
telling the papers that
Kathie's been doing drugs,

28:32.319 --> 28:34.079
dragging her name through
the mud like that?

28:34.103 --> 28:35.907
He's not talking
to the press now.

28:35.931 --> 28:37.474
Why isn't he talking
to the police?

28:37.498 --> 28:39.258
Couldn't you hire a
private investigator?

28:39.282 --> 28:42.174
Wouldn't you do that
for one of your own?

28:42.198 --> 28:44.350
Kathie was like a
daughter to me.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.569
"Was"?

28:45.593 --> 28:46.788
Was. Is.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.398
What? Am I being interrogated?

28:48.422 --> 28:50.487
No, Mr. Durst, we
just need your help.

28:50.511 --> 28:52.271
If it was your daughter,

28:52.295 --> 28:54.796
you would do everything
you could to find her,

28:54.820 --> 28:55.797
but you just don't care.

28:55.821 --> 28:58.016
- I...
- What's going on?

28:58.040 --> 28:59.496
It's about Kathie.

28:59.520 --> 29:00.497
This discussion is over.

29:00.521 --> 29:03.021
What? No...

29:03.045 --> 29:03.979
Why won't you help us?

29:04.003 --> 29:05.328
I said, the meeting is over.

29:05.352 --> 29:06.875
No, please!

29:25.285 --> 29:26.349
Is it that bad?

29:26.373 --> 29:27.654
No.

29:27.678 --> 29:30.048
You just look different.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.964
He's always telling
me what to do.

29:32.988 --> 29:35.488
How to look, how to feel.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.446
How to walk, how to...

29:36.470 --> 29:37.490
It's okay, it's good.

29:37.514 --> 29:39.971
You look handsome.

29:39.995 --> 29:42.389
I've got a crazy idea.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.324
What is it?

29:45.348 --> 29:47.829
How about you and
me get hitched?

29:49.526 --> 29:50.526
What?

29:52.138 --> 29:53.458
I'm the best me
when I'm with you.

29:57.621 --> 29:59.754
So, what do you say,
Kathie McCormack?

30:02.931 --> 30:04.150
Yes.

30:05.107 --> 30:06.955
Yes.

30:09.024 --> 30:11.133
Sounds like our song...

30:35.964 --> 30:38.595
When would you go then?

30:38.619 --> 30:39.944
Long weekend maybe.

30:39.968 --> 30:43.339
I think it's two weeks,
just outside of Chicago.

30:43.363 --> 30:46.821
Yeah, I told him I'd
visit him in Chicago.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.300
This is for the newlyweds.

30:48.324 --> 30:49.432
Oh.

30:49.456 --> 30:50.433
Thank you.

30:50.457 --> 30:51.762
On the house.

30:53.764 --> 30:56.134
We need a bill.

30:56.158 --> 30:58.310
Would you like a
bite, my husband?

30:58.334 --> 31:00.617
Your husband would adore a bite,

31:00.641 --> 31:01.641
new wife.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.490
Oh!

31:04.514 --> 31:06.014
Now I want revenge.

31:06.038 --> 31:07.363
Oh...

31:07.387 --> 31:08.954
Oh, good. That's good.

31:14.785 --> 31:17.242
Split it?

31:17.266 --> 31:19.636
Um... of course.

31:19.660 --> 31:20.855
What are you doing, Dad?

31:20.879 --> 31:21.681
What am I doing?

31:21.705 --> 31:22.813
Yeah.

31:22.837 --> 31:24.119
I am paying my bill,

31:24.143 --> 31:25.555
that's what I'm doing.

31:25.579 --> 31:27.078
- It's okay.
- No, Mom.

31:27.102 --> 31:28.471
We'll pay, right?

31:28.495 --> 31:30.081
I can pay for my own meal,

31:30.105 --> 31:32.301
and yours.

31:32.325 --> 31:33.693
It's okay, honey,

31:33.717 --> 31:35.067
I don't need a handout.

31:39.419 --> 31:40.962
Congratulations.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.050
I am...

31:42.074 --> 31:43.858
I'm late for a meeting.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.017
Douglas speaking.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.423
Douglas speaking.

32:28.598 --> 32:30.252
Bob?

32:38.695 --> 32:39.695
Knock it off, asshole.

32:44.266 --> 32:47.028
You got a problem there, Doug?

32:47.052 --> 32:49.030
Hmm?

32:49.054 --> 32:50.074
You got a problem?

32:50.098 --> 32:52.318
No?

32:54.102 --> 32:55.732
Okay.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.955
Okay.

33:14.079 --> 33:15.186
Finally!

33:15.210 --> 33:16.883
I've been waiting
for over an hour.

33:16.907 --> 33:17.972
You look pale.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.103
You need a drink.

33:19.127 --> 33:20.367
I need a lot more than a drink.

33:20.391 --> 33:21.714
Tell me about it,

33:21.738 --> 33:22.933
It took me three Valium
and five Bloody Marys

33:22.957 --> 33:23.629
to get through all the
stories about you

33:23.653 --> 33:24.587
in the papers, Bobby.

33:24.611 --> 33:25.805
Gimme a break, okay,

33:25.829 --> 33:27.720
you know that that's
crazy, all that stuff.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.304
They're animals, they'll
print anything.

33:29.328 --> 33:30.636
It's even on the news.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.508
Prudence Farrow, Bobby, really?

33:32.532 --> 33:33.857
She's a second-rate celebrity.

33:33.881 --> 33:35.761
Okay, John Lennon wrote
the song "Dear Prudence"

33:35.785 --> 33:36.903
about that woman, and I...

33:36.927 --> 33:38.209
So, that's a reason
to sleep with her?

33:38.233 --> 33:39.953
You know, you're impressed
by stupid things.

33:39.977 --> 33:41.097
Listen to me, I know that...

33:43.630 --> 33:45.782
I know that the affair
was not a good idea,

33:45.806 --> 33:47.914
but it is over now, okay?

33:47.938 --> 33:48.872
It's over.

33:48.896 --> 33:50.613
Okay.

33:50.637 --> 33:52.397
Okay.

33:52.421 --> 33:53.659
I'm here for you.

33:53.683 --> 33:55.226
How can Suzy help?

33:55.250 --> 33:56.749
We need to get the
press off my back.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.795
I need a martini.

33:58.819 --> 34:01.015
And I'm gonna need
your phone, please.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.974
Hello? Is this Mr. Thomas
from "The New York Times"?

34:03.998 --> 34:05.062
Yes, this is Susan Berman.

34:05.086 --> 34:06.324
I'm calling to tell you

34:06.348 --> 34:07.717
that Bobby's not talking
to anyone, I'm sorry.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.719
Just write that he's
really heartbroken.

34:09.743 --> 34:10.862
He's honestly unable to cope

34:10.887 --> 34:12.246
with the disappearance
of his wife.

34:12.271 --> 34:13.418
Thank you.

34:13.442 --> 34:14.442
"The Post."

34:15.270 --> 34:17.509
Yes, this is Susan Berman.

34:17.533 --> 34:18.771
No, I'm his spokesperson now,

34:18.795 --> 34:19.989
helping him through
this difficult time.

34:20.014 --> 34:21.654
Just write that he's
really heartbroken...

34:21.678 --> 34:22.610
Really heartbroken.

34:22.635 --> 34:23.297
Thank you.

34:23.322 --> 34:24.473
Okay, next?

34:24.496 --> 34:26.127
That bitch. That bitch
is a nightmare.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.650
He's completely distraught,

34:27.674 --> 34:30.565
clinging to the hope that
Kathie is still alive.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.568
"The New Yorker" really
wants to talk to you.

34:32.592 --> 34:33.482
I'm not talking to anybody.

34:33.505 --> 34:34.396
I'm sorry,

34:34.420 --> 34:35.397
Bobby's not available.

34:35.420 --> 34:36.485
"Distraught."

34:36.509 --> 34:37.509
Thank you.

34:39.120 --> 34:40.141
That went well.

34:40.165 --> 34:41.469
You did good.

34:55.331 --> 34:56.331
Hey.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.704
Hi.

35:03.971 --> 35:05.340
What's going on?

35:10.847 --> 35:13.067
I have good news.

35:19.204 --> 35:20.398
No...

35:20.422 --> 35:22.032
No, no, no.

35:23.033 --> 35:24.359
No, no, no, no.

35:24.383 --> 35:26.012
You'll learn to love it.

35:26.036 --> 35:27.579
No, I won't.

35:27.603 --> 35:28.711
You will.

35:28.735 --> 35:30.452
You'll be a great father.

35:30.476 --> 35:31.801
No, I will not be a father.

35:31.825 --> 35:32.845
You promised me,

35:32.869 --> 35:34.238
and we promised together,

35:34.262 --> 35:35.326
no kids.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.893
I know, I...

35:36.917 --> 35:39.200
but it-it happened, and...

35:39.224 --> 35:40.157
It will bring us
closer together...

35:40.181 --> 35:41.245
Are you kidding?

35:41.269 --> 35:43.900
It will tear us apart, Kathie.

35:43.924 --> 35:45.771
No.

35:45.795 --> 35:47.599
Bobby...

35:47.623 --> 35:49.079
Please, do not... Let me...

35:49.103 --> 35:50.183
You're taking care of this.

35:52.062 --> 35:53.736
Don't make me do that.

35:53.760 --> 35:55.390
You're taking care of this,

35:55.414 --> 35:56.608
that's what you're doing.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.566
You're taking care of this.

35:57.590 --> 35:58.697
Please don't make me...

35:58.721 --> 36:00.612
No.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.658
We discussed this, and you...

36:02.682 --> 36:04.834
I mean, you said to me
over and over again...

36:04.858 --> 36:07.252
You promised me!

36:16.783 --> 36:19.240
You don't have to do this.

36:19.264 --> 36:20.980
You can walk out
of here right now,

36:21.004 --> 36:24.810
go tell Mom the good news.

36:24.834 --> 36:27.161
That I'm pregnant, and
getting divorced?

36:27.185 --> 36:30.362
It's better than
getting an abortion.

36:32.102 --> 36:33.732
Leave.

36:33.756 --> 36:34.907
Okay?

36:34.931 --> 36:36.822
You have a baby.

36:36.846 --> 36:39.303
You have a life inside of you.

36:39.327 --> 36:40.696
You will feel a love

36:40.720 --> 36:43.438
like you have never felt before.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.875
Far greater than the
love you have for Bobby,

36:45.899 --> 36:49.052
who doesn't want his own child.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.663
How can you love a man
that's so selfish?

36:51.687 --> 36:52.925
He's not...

36:56.039 --> 36:57.756
He watched his mother die.

36:57.780 --> 37:00.957
Having a child would
make him relive that.

37:02.089 --> 37:05.484
I knew he didn't want it.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.617
I don't want to lose him, Mary.

37:10.837 --> 37:13.013
Mrs. Durst?

37:58.101 --> 37:59.494
Hi.

38:03.237 --> 38:05.587
I took care of it.

38:11.637 --> 38:14.703
Maybe you and I should just
get out of here for a while.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.139
Why don't we go someplace

38:16.163 --> 38:18.010
and get a change of
scenery or something?

38:18.034 --> 38:19.993
You know?

38:22.125 --> 38:25.346
Whatcha think?

38:27.957 --> 38:30.525
Why are you making that face?

38:33.398 --> 38:35.419
I'm not making a face...

38:35.443 --> 38:36.377
Yes, you are.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.335
You are making a face.

38:38.359 --> 38:39.621
I'm watching you make a face.

38:40.796 --> 38:42.102
What are you talking about?

38:43.408 --> 38:45.690
I am not making a face.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.039
I just killed our baby.

38:47.063 --> 38:48.084
Stop it...

38:48.108 --> 38:49.041
You're telling me...

38:49.065 --> 38:50.391
Stop!

38:50.415 --> 38:51.807
Don't you yell at me like that.

38:53.505 --> 38:55.352
Don't!

38:55.376 --> 38:56.397
Bobby!

38:56.421 --> 38:57.441
Stop it... Stop...

38:57.465 --> 38:59.269
No!

38:59.293 --> 39:00.293
No!

39:46.993 --> 39:48.274
I know it's a fixer-upper,

39:48.298 --> 39:50.625
but, uh...

39:50.649 --> 39:53.367
Come on, huh, that view?

39:53.391 --> 39:55.325
The fireplace, the...

39:55.349 --> 39:57.307
I mean, everything, it's...

40:04.663 --> 40:09.189
Baby, I want us to
start over again.

40:10.843 --> 40:13.299
You and me.

40:13.323 --> 40:14.847
Just us.

40:15.935 --> 40:18.087
Okay?

40:18.111 --> 40:19.504
We'll take it.

40:21.201 --> 40:23.745
You want it?

40:23.769 --> 40:24.770
We'll take it.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.459
Hey, Robert.

40:42.483 --> 40:43.504
Yeah.

40:43.528 --> 40:44.635
We got the phone records.

40:44.659 --> 40:45.854
Finally.

40:45.878 --> 40:47.158
He never made the
call that night

40:47.182 --> 40:48.378
to the penthouse,

40:48.402 --> 40:49.682
the phone call he
supposedly made

40:49.706 --> 40:51.599
on his three-mile walk
in the rain and sleet.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.339
Never happened. He lied.

40:53.363 --> 40:55.516
He was trying to hide
where he was that night.

40:55.540 --> 40:56.865
Kathie disappears on a Monday.

40:56.889 --> 40:58.519
On Tuesday, there's a
collect call to the office.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.650
That's his M.O., right?

40:59.674 --> 41:00.477
Collect call?

41:00.501 --> 41:01.522
Yeah.

41:01.546 --> 41:02.746
This one was from Ship Bottom,

41:02.770 --> 41:04.554
near Atlantic City.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.553
Shit.

41:10.163 --> 41:12.446
The Pine Barrens.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.231
Ship Bottom is near
the Pine Barrens.

41:15.255 --> 41:16.711
The mafia's dumping ground.

41:16.735 --> 41:18.388
That son of a bitch.

41:19.999 --> 41:22.368
He killed her.

41:42.955 --> 41:43.955
Hi.

41:43.979 --> 41:45.000
Hi. I'm Robin Hill.

41:45.024 --> 41:45.914
Housecleaning?

41:45.938 --> 41:46.871
Oh, okay.

41:46.895 --> 41:48.394
Come on in.

41:48.418 --> 41:50.048
Let me show you the house.

41:50.072 --> 41:51.572
This is, um...

41:51.596 --> 41:53.574
This is pretty much it.

41:54.773 --> 41:56.533
That's Bobby, over there...

41:56.557 --> 41:59.144
This is beautiful.

41:59.168 --> 42:01.388
You guys must have a nice life.

42:16.229 --> 42:19.208
The evidence is compelling,

42:19.232 --> 42:21.147
but it's still just
circumstantial.

42:22.104 --> 42:23.604
There's no body.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.867
If we went forward,

42:25.891 --> 42:27.564
think about what would happen.

42:27.588 --> 42:28.783
Durst would be indicted.

42:28.807 --> 42:30.654
He'd hire the best
criminal lawyers

42:30.678 --> 42:31.655
with all his money.

42:31.679 --> 42:34.179
They'd destroy our case,

42:34.203 --> 42:35.224
attack the wife,

42:35.248 --> 42:36.399
drag her through the mud,

42:36.423 --> 42:37.574
and if Durst is acquitted,

42:37.598 --> 42:40.775
which is highly likely...

42:42.255 --> 42:44.581
Double jeopardy protects him
for the rest of his life,

42:44.605 --> 42:45.713
even when one day

42:45.737 --> 42:48.193
someone does come and
tells the truth.

42:48.217 --> 42:50.021
He's guilty, Roger.

42:50.045 --> 42:51.762
He did it.

42:51.786 --> 42:53.614
Maybe.

42:56.922 --> 43:00.186
But I am partial to
winning my cases.

43:11.043 --> 43:12.043
Good morning.

43:12.067 --> 43:13.634
Hey, how you doing?

43:15.462 --> 43:16.768
Good morning.

43:18.073 --> 43:19.684
Aw, there's trouble.

43:21.619 --> 43:22.619
Morning, Henry.

43:22.643 --> 43:24.142
Hey, Hollywood?

43:28.562 --> 43:30.192
Detective Becerra.

43:30.216 --> 43:31.585
Hey, it's Tim Martin.

43:31.609 --> 43:33.804
Timmy...

43:33.828 --> 43:35.806
Uh-oh, are you in trouble again?

43:35.830 --> 43:37.591
Not really...

43:37.615 --> 43:39.070
Kinda, yeah.

43:39.094 --> 43:40.942
But I got information for you.

43:40.966 --> 43:42.334
Remember Kathie Durst?

43:42.358 --> 43:43.553
Married to Robert Durst?

43:43.577 --> 43:45.337
Rich city guy.

43:45.361 --> 43:46.382
Yeah, vaguely.

43:46.406 --> 43:47.383
What about her?

43:47.407 --> 43:49.037
Well, he killed her,

43:49.061 --> 43:50.691
and he was never
arrested for it.

43:50.715 --> 43:51.866
Really?

43:51.890 --> 43:53.607
How do you know he killed her?

43:53.631 --> 43:55.260
My ex-sister-in-law told me.

43:55.284 --> 43:56.958
She used to be
their housekeeper.

43:56.982 --> 43:58.002
That's good, right?

43:58.026 --> 44:00.135
This'll help my case, right?

44:00.159 --> 44:01.439
What's your
sister-in-law's name?

44:01.463 --> 44:03.878
Robin Hill.

44:03.902 --> 44:05.836
All right, I'll get back to you.

44:05.860 --> 44:06.750
Yo, Henry.

44:06.774 --> 44:07.882
Yeah?

44:07.906 --> 44:09.666
You ever heard of
a Kathie Durst?

44:09.690 --> 44:11.886
No, never heard of her.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.801
Well, Timmy Martin says

44:13.825 --> 44:16.238
that he knows that the
husband killed her.

44:16.262 --> 44:17.979
Maybe a cold case?

44:18.003 --> 44:19.003
Maybe.

44:22.616 --> 44:23.680
Kathie Durst?

44:23.704 --> 44:24.594
Early '80s.

44:24.618 --> 44:26.901
Disappeared. Probably dead.

44:26.925 --> 44:28.250
That's everything we have on it.

44:28.274 --> 44:29.797
Knock yourself out.

44:30.842 --> 44:32.254
That's it?

44:32.278 --> 44:33.429
That's it.

44:33.453 --> 44:35.039
The case was New York City's.

44:35.063 --> 44:36.663
They didn't do much
here at State Police.

44:36.687 --> 44:37.476
Whoa, look at this.

44:37.500 --> 44:39.348
A woman disappears,

44:39.372 --> 44:41.437
it says the husband beats
the crap out of her,

44:41.461 --> 44:43.831
and he's not even a suspect?

44:43.855 --> 44:45.659
17 years ago.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.641
I guess people were
different then.

44:48.903 --> 44:50.557
I'll say.

44:55.147 --> 44:56.147
One Police Plaza.

44:56.171 --> 44:58.106
Becerra. NY State Police BCI.

44:58.130 --> 44:59.629
Can you get me whatever
files you have

44:59.653 --> 45:02.327
on the Kathie Durst case?

45:02.351 --> 45:04.310
D-U-R-S-T.

45:15.103 --> 45:17.125
You know,

45:17.149 --> 45:20.998
I'm thinking of going
to nursing school.

45:21.022 --> 45:25.002
Now, why would you
want to do that?

45:25.026 --> 45:27.788
'Cause I want to do something.

45:27.812 --> 45:31.269
Something that's all mine.

45:31.293 --> 45:33.469
What else am I supposed
to do with my life?

45:36.690 --> 45:38.450
Well, you used to be
happy making me happy.

45:38.474 --> 45:40.975
You used to be happier.

45:40.999 --> 45:42.696
Maybe I was.

45:49.593 --> 45:50.593
Okay, forget I said that

45:50.617 --> 45:52.813
Forget I said...

45:52.837 --> 45:54.945
Kathie, I think it's
a wonderful idea.

45:54.969 --> 45:56.425
How about you go
to nursing school,

45:56.449 --> 45:57.905
you earn a few extra bucks,

45:57.929 --> 46:01.212
you might actually make a
contribution around here.

46:01.236 --> 46:03.780
What happened to you?

46:03.804 --> 46:04.955
You've changed.

46:04.979 --> 46:06.807
You never used to
talk to me like that.

46:09.070 --> 46:10.811
Maybe I'm not the
one that changed.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.164
Ever think about that?

46:38.099 --> 46:40.251
All right.

46:40.275 --> 46:42.297
I'm done.

46:42.321 --> 46:43.321
Okay.

46:44.366 --> 46:45.866
Thank you.

46:45.890 --> 46:47.911
Is something wrong?

46:47.935 --> 46:49.347
You seem... off.

46:49.371 --> 46:51.654
No, no, it's just Bobby.

46:51.678 --> 46:53.767
He's controlling.

46:55.377 --> 46:57.486
Well, at least he's rich.

46:57.510 --> 46:59.555
You always say that.

47:01.253 --> 47:03.318
Hey, so I'll see you next week?

47:03.342 --> 47:04.798
Unless you want to go out again.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.147
No, I'm headed back to the city,

47:06.171 --> 47:07.975
and I've been partying
too much with you.

47:07.999 --> 47:10.064
All right, well, hang in there.

47:10.088 --> 47:11.263
Enjoy your millions.

47:37.985 --> 47:39.615
Hey, are you new?

47:39.639 --> 47:40.659
Uh, hi.

47:40.683 --> 47:42.357
Yeah. Is it obvious?

47:42.381 --> 47:44.185
Yeah, it's the deer in
the headlights look.

47:44.209 --> 47:46.622
I'm looking for
Intro to Nursing.

47:46.646 --> 47:47.666
Oh, yeah? Me, too.

47:47.690 --> 47:48.754
Just come along.

47:48.778 --> 47:50.800
What's your name?

47:50.824 --> 47:51.757
Kathie.

47:51.781 --> 47:52.802
I'm Gilberte.

47:52.826 --> 47:53.759
Nice to meet you.

47:53.783 --> 47:54.848
You too.

47:54.872 --> 47:55.805
Hey, this is Kathie.

47:55.829 --> 47:57.328
- She's new.
- Ellen.

47:57.352 --> 47:58.068
Hi. Nice to meet you.

47:58.092 --> 47:59.026
Eleanor.

47:59.050 --> 48:00.375
Hi.

48:00.399 --> 48:01.202
- You guys want to go?
- Yeah, let's go to class.

48:01.226 --> 48:02.072
Just as a reminder,

48:02.096 --> 48:03.508
service-learning is required

48:03.532 --> 48:04.814
with a 10-hour activity,

48:04.838 --> 48:06.163
and a written report

48:06.187 --> 48:08.426
on the anatomy and case
study we just discussed.

48:08.450 --> 48:11.038
Have a good week.
Class dismissed.

48:11.062 --> 48:12.953
So, what did you think?

48:12.977 --> 48:14.084
Oh, it was great.

48:14.108 --> 48:15.303
It was interesting.

48:15.327 --> 48:16.847
Yeah, I never slept
so well in my life.

48:17.654 --> 48:18.654
You're so bad.

48:18.678 --> 48:20.332
You don't know the half of it.

48:22.029 --> 48:23.702
All right, come on,
let's get lunch.

48:23.726 --> 48:26.401
Welcome to the
rebel nurses club.

48:26.425 --> 48:28.098
Wait, what are you
talking about?

48:28.122 --> 48:30.666
My mother taught me how
to box when I was 12.

48:30.690 --> 48:32.059
In our kitchen,

48:32.083 --> 48:33.321
with gloves and everything.

48:33.345 --> 48:35.323
She didn't want anybody
kicking me around.

48:35.347 --> 48:36.454
Well, you know,

48:36.478 --> 48:37.368
it's actually a
good skill to have.

48:37.392 --> 48:38.456
Like, self-defense.

48:38.480 --> 48:39.631
Yeah.

48:39.655 --> 48:41.242
My mom taught me how
to make a martini.

48:42.940 --> 48:43.940
Well, that figures.

48:43.964 --> 48:44.965
Yeah.

49:16.475 --> 49:18.042
Hey.

49:19.739 --> 49:21.804
Oh, I found these.

49:21.828 --> 49:23.090
What are they?

49:25.701 --> 49:26.964
I didn't know what they were.

49:30.619 --> 49:32.510
Okay, yeah.

49:32.534 --> 49:34.773
Yeah, yeah, you...

49:34.797 --> 49:36.471
you found those, you found...

49:36.495 --> 49:38.932
You caught me.

49:41.108 --> 49:42.520
What's that supposed to mean?

49:42.544 --> 49:45.591
Isn't it obvious, Kathie,
that I'm having an affair?

49:48.637 --> 49:50.117
Do you want me to
spell it out to you?

49:50.141 --> 49:51.051
A woman comes,

49:51.075 --> 49:52.008
I arrange the apartment

49:52.032 --> 49:53.312
to make it look like I'm single.

49:53.336 --> 49:54.532
The woman leaves,

49:54.556 --> 49:56.056
I take these Polaroids,

49:56.080 --> 49:57.971
and I use them to
rearrange everything

49:57.995 --> 49:59.537
so it looks like it did before,

49:59.561 --> 50:00.364
so you don't notice.

50:00.388 --> 50:02.888
But now... you noticed.

50:02.912 --> 50:05.393
So here we are.

50:09.157 --> 50:10.677
Look, you don't have
to worry about it.

50:10.701 --> 50:11.549
I don't...

50:11.573 --> 50:12.966
You don't know her.

50:23.020 --> 50:25.694
Thank you for coming
down to see me.

50:25.718 --> 50:28.262
I'm not sure why I'm
talking to you.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.437
Well, you know,

50:29.461 --> 50:30.438
to help out your
brother-in-law, Timmy.

50:30.462 --> 50:31.830
Ex-brother-in-law.

50:31.854 --> 50:33.093
He's a creep.

50:33.117 --> 50:35.095
I don't even care
what happens to him,

50:35.119 --> 50:37.662
but I do care if Bobby finds
out I'm talking to you.

50:37.686 --> 50:38.794
Are you afraid of him?

50:38.818 --> 50:41.666
He comes from a powerful family.

50:41.690 --> 50:42.667
Well, he won't know.

50:42.691 --> 50:44.060
You have my word.

50:44.084 --> 50:45.644
Come on, you came all
the way down here.

50:45.668 --> 50:48.064
Isn't there anything
you can tell me?

50:48.088 --> 50:49.718
After Kathie disappeared,

50:49.742 --> 50:51.198
I was at the South Salem house,

50:51.222 --> 50:53.113
and I found personal ads.

50:53.137 --> 50:54.375
Kinky stuff

50:54.399 --> 50:56.899
that Bobby was putting
in "The Village Voice."

50:56.923 --> 50:59.336
The dates went back, too,

50:59.360 --> 51:01.382
like he'd been doing
this for years.

51:01.406 --> 51:04.080
And he put a new ad in the paper

51:04.104 --> 51:05.864
right after Kathie disappeared.

51:05.888 --> 51:08.258
There's a lot at stake here,

51:08.282 --> 51:10.565
Crazy Bobby could drag
the whole family down.

51:10.589 --> 51:11.609
"Crazy Bobby"?

51:11.633 --> 51:12.913
You don't know how weird he was.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.048
He would bark and
growl to himself.

51:15.072 --> 51:17.093
Sometimes, he would scream
at the edge of the lake,

51:17.117 --> 51:19.139
just stand there, screaming.

51:19.163 --> 51:21.184
And he would disappear for days.

51:21.208 --> 51:22.359
Disappear for days?

51:22.383 --> 51:23.752
Nobody knew where he went.

51:23.776 --> 51:24.840
He never said.

51:24.864 --> 51:27.277
But the clothes he came back in,

51:27.301 --> 51:28.713
well...

51:28.737 --> 51:31.088
let's just say they weren't
the ones he left in.

51:58.811 --> 52:00.005
What are you doing?

52:00.029 --> 52:01.355
I'm taking out the trash.

52:01.379 --> 52:02.269
What does it look
like I'm doing?

52:02.293 --> 52:03.531
It's empty.

52:03.555 --> 52:05.620
What do you want
from me, Kathie?

52:05.644 --> 52:07.796
Okay, well, you know, actually,

52:07.820 --> 52:10.190
I need, um... I need
some spending money,

52:10.214 --> 52:12.148
for my books, and
for subway tokens,

52:12.172 --> 52:14.237
and for food...

52:14.261 --> 52:15.543
Surprise, you need money, okay,

52:15.567 --> 52:17.287
So, why do I have to
give you all the money?

52:17.311 --> 52:18.471
Why can't you do any of this?

52:18.495 --> 52:19.155
What?

52:19.179 --> 52:20.678
Anything at all?

52:20.702 --> 52:23.072
Are you really that cheap?

52:23.096 --> 52:25.205
You're my husband.

52:25.229 --> 52:27.361
You used to be my wife.

52:30.669 --> 52:32.869
Bobby, you pretend like you're
nothing like your father.

52:34.586 --> 52:35.761
You are exactly like him.

52:51.907 --> 52:53.189
Can I help you?

52:53.213 --> 52:54.582
Hi.

52:54.606 --> 52:58.673
Are you, uh, Gabrielle Colquitt?

52:58.697 --> 53:00.065
Yes. Why?

53:00.089 --> 53:02.242
I'm Investigator Becerra.

53:02.266 --> 53:03.591
I'm looking into

53:03.615 --> 53:05.245
the disappearance
of Kathie Durst.

53:05.269 --> 53:06.768
Kathie Durst...

53:06.792 --> 53:09.031
She lived in this
house originally.

53:09.055 --> 53:11.642
I thought that was
over a long time ago.

53:11.666 --> 53:13.514
We received some
new information.

53:13.538 --> 53:14.906
Okay.

53:14.930 --> 53:18.171
Come with me.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.563
Nice place you got here.

53:19.587 --> 53:21.391
Thank you.

53:21.415 --> 53:23.393
I bought the house from
the previous owners,

53:23.417 --> 53:24.612
the Garceaus.

53:24.636 --> 53:25.874
Thank you.

53:25.898 --> 53:28.224
They bought it
from Durst in '90.

53:28.248 --> 53:30.226
I don't know what
you'd find here now.

53:30.250 --> 53:32.576
I'm sure the police
searched it back then.

53:32.600 --> 53:33.969
No, they didn't.

53:33.993 --> 53:35.405
I mean, not really.

53:35.429 --> 53:37.538
I'd just, I'd like to
come down with a team,

53:37.562 --> 53:38.930
and just, you know, look
around a little bit.

53:38.954 --> 53:40.280
Maybe even go down to the lake,

53:40.304 --> 53:41.716
if that's possible.

53:41.740 --> 53:43.100
I mean, maybe we'll
find something,

53:43.124 --> 53:44.501
maybe not, but...

53:44.525 --> 53:46.788
at least then we'll
know for sure.

53:53.230 --> 53:54.729
Do me a favor,

53:54.753 --> 53:56.953
and get a couple of guys to
check under the crawl space.

54:06.721 --> 54:09.265
What happened to you?

54:12.901 --> 54:14.879
This grill...

54:14.903 --> 54:16.925
did you pick it
up in a junkyard?

54:16.949 --> 54:19.449
It's disgusting.

54:19.473 --> 54:20.798
Everything's all rusted.

54:28.308 --> 54:29.329
Aw, sweetie.

54:29.353 --> 54:30.633
This is a great
party, thank you.

54:30.657 --> 54:31.547
How are you feeling?

54:31.571 --> 54:32.549
Good.

54:32.573 --> 54:33.813
Yeah, well, doctor degree next.

54:33.837 --> 54:36.553
Yeah, I'm thinking
maybe medical school?

54:36.577 --> 54:37.772
Why not?

54:37.796 --> 54:40.905
You would be an
amazing pediatrician?

54:40.929 --> 54:42.646
Papa would have been
so proud of you.

54:42.670 --> 54:43.778
Yeah.

54:43.802 --> 54:45.301
I wish he was here.

54:45.325 --> 54:46.325
Yeah, me too.

54:48.633 --> 54:50.828
Bobby! Bobby!

54:50.852 --> 54:51.916
Finally.

54:51.940 --> 54:53.004
Bobby!

54:53.028 --> 54:54.702
Oh, God, I can't
believe I made it.

54:54.726 --> 54:55.659
It was raining on
the Tappan Zee,

54:55.683 --> 54:56.834
and I nearly died.

54:56.858 --> 54:57.922
And you know how I feel

54:57.946 --> 54:59.386
about bridges,
tunnels, and freeways,

54:59.410 --> 55:00.142
and rain.

55:00.166 --> 55:01.230
Where's Kathie?

55:01.254 --> 55:02.100
Right there. She's over there.

55:02.124 --> 55:03.101
Hi.

55:03.125 --> 55:04.712
Hi, Susan.

55:04.736 --> 55:05.626
Yeah, I suppose it's about time.

55:05.650 --> 55:06.975
Congratulations!

55:09.610 --> 55:11.371
Congratulations, I
believe, are in order.

55:11.395 --> 55:14.330
My little nurse, Kathie.

55:14.354 --> 55:15.244
Anybody sick here?

55:15.268 --> 55:16.348
Do we have any sick people?

55:17.705 --> 55:19.465
I mean, anyone around
who has a sickness? No?

55:19.489 --> 55:20.554
Bobby, what are you doing?

55:20.578 --> 55:21.729
Any takers? Pass?

55:21.753 --> 55:23.433
No, what? Come on, we
got some sick people?

55:23.457 --> 55:25.559
Because we have a regular
Florence Nightingale

55:25.583 --> 55:26.734
over here, don't we?

55:26.758 --> 55:28.126
Come on, it's...

55:28.150 --> 55:30.259
No, what, I'm saying she's
Florence Nightingale.

55:30.283 --> 55:32.000
She can take of everyone...

55:32.024 --> 55:32.914
else.

55:32.938 --> 55:33.938
No, don't do that.

55:34.722 --> 55:36.265
You know what,

55:36.289 --> 55:36.874
the only thing that my wife
is gonna be nursing tomorrow

55:36.898 --> 55:37.919
is a hangover,

55:37.943 --> 55:38.789
so you might have to wait.

55:38.813 --> 55:39.964
- Stop it.
- What?

55:39.988 --> 55:41.270
Get out of here. Come on.

55:41.294 --> 55:43.054
What's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?

55:44.210 --> 55:45.361
Just ignore him.

55:45.385 --> 55:46.865
He's just jealous.

55:48.910 --> 55:51.149
Yeah...

55:51.173 --> 55:54.046
I don't know what it is.

56:00.226 --> 56:01.638
Hey, what's this all about?

56:01.662 --> 56:02.857
I want you to know

56:02.881 --> 56:03.961
that I've reopened the case

56:03.985 --> 56:05.265
of your daughter's
disappearance.

56:05.289 --> 56:07.688
You mean her murder?

56:07.712 --> 56:09.429
How's it gonna help,

56:09.453 --> 56:11.822
after all this time?

56:11.846 --> 56:13.607
Kathie deserves justice,

56:13.631 --> 56:16.000
and Robert should be held
accountable if he's guilty.

56:16.024 --> 56:17.088
He is guilty.

56:17.112 --> 56:18.592
Did you know that I
had to go to court

56:18.616 --> 56:21.092
to look over my own
daughter's estate?

56:21.116 --> 56:24.269
That monster
challenged me and won.

56:24.293 --> 56:27.185
He forged stock-transfer
documents

56:27.209 --> 56:28.448
held in Kathie's name

56:28.472 --> 56:30.667
just to sell them.

56:30.691 --> 56:32.539
Jim and Mary, they
went to his apartment,

56:32.563 --> 56:33.496
found Kathie's jewelry,

56:33.520 --> 56:34.976
her diamond earrings,

56:35.000 --> 56:35.890
her watch, her wedding band,

56:35.914 --> 56:36.978
heart pendant...

56:37.002 --> 56:39.023
Bobby lied,

56:39.047 --> 56:41.896
told us she was wearing
them when she disappeared.

56:41.920 --> 56:43.767
Good. Good, this is all good.

56:43.791 --> 56:45.378
I'm going to need to
know all of this.

56:45.402 --> 56:46.727
We'll sit,

56:46.751 --> 56:47.684
we'll do a statement,

56:47.708 --> 56:49.251
I'll take down all the info.

56:49.275 --> 56:50.165
Mr. Becerra...

56:50.189 --> 56:52.080
how can we,

56:52.104 --> 56:54.735
a little family
from Long Island,

56:54.759 --> 56:57.738
fight rich, powerful
people like the Dursts?

56:57.762 --> 57:00.871
What justice is there
for people like us?

57:00.895 --> 57:02.525
My daughter is dead.

57:02.549 --> 57:04.551
I've made peace with it.

57:07.336 --> 57:10.707
You want to investigate,
you go ahead.

57:10.731 --> 57:13.318
You'll get tired of
the case someday,

57:13.342 --> 57:14.494
or you'll transfer,

57:14.518 --> 57:15.625
or retire.

57:15.649 --> 57:18.019
We've already failed once.

57:18.043 --> 57:21.307
I can't go through
it all over again.

57:22.656 --> 57:26.375
This was not an easy
decision to make.

57:26.399 --> 57:29.489
You know that I love
you both equally.

57:30.795 --> 57:32.686
I've given it much
consideration,

57:32.710 --> 57:36.757
and I feel that it
would be best if...

57:37.845 --> 57:40.389
Douglas take over the company

57:40.413 --> 57:41.999
after I step down.

57:42.023 --> 57:43.566
I know the tradition
is for the eldest

57:43.590 --> 57:45.786
to take that
position, but, uh...

57:47.333 --> 57:48.528
for many reasons,

57:48.552 --> 57:52.512
I feel this would
be best for all.

57:55.733 --> 57:57.493
Well, congratulations, Dougie.

57:57.517 --> 57:59.147
You deserve it.

57:59.171 --> 58:02.367
We all know that this...
this makes perfect sense.

58:02.391 --> 58:03.456
I mean, come on.

58:03.480 --> 58:04.892
You know...

58:04.916 --> 58:06.502
Let's be honest with ourselves,

58:06.526 --> 58:09.549
what the hell did I ever
do for this place, right?

58:09.573 --> 58:11.289
You know?

58:11.313 --> 58:12.465
I mean, you, Dougie,

58:12.489 --> 58:13.988
I mean, you're just
such a solid guy,

58:14.012 --> 58:16.207
you're such a good
boy, you know?

58:16.231 --> 58:17.551
I mean, you're a
good boy, Dougie.

58:17.575 --> 58:18.732
That's the thing,

58:18.756 --> 58:22.562
you're just such a good... boy.

58:22.586 --> 58:24.041
You're special that way.

58:25.371 --> 58:27.547
You're definitely
considered special.

58:29.114 --> 58:31.788
You know, Daddy loves you.

58:31.812 --> 58:34.249
He really, really loves you.

58:41.756 --> 58:42.756
So, told her I needed
to tie her shoe,

58:42.780 --> 58:44.105
so I got down on one knee,

58:44.129 --> 58:45.929
but we're on the beach,
so she's in bare feet,

58:45.953 --> 58:46.582
and she didn't even
figure it out.

58:46.914 --> 58:48.762
What she said was,
"Are you sober?"

58:50.352 --> 58:52.505
That's what she says?

58:52.529 --> 58:54.249
No, she's, "No, I got
this ring on my hand!"

58:55.793 --> 58:57.510
Let me see it again,
it's so pretty.

58:57.534 --> 58:58.815
Oh, thank you.

58:58.839 --> 59:01.035
We're so excited. It's
going to be beautiful.

59:01.059 --> 59:03.037
My parents have actually offered

59:03.061 --> 59:07.041
to let us have the reception at
the Brookville Country Club.

59:07.065 --> 59:09.913
I'm hoping you can maybe
help us decorate.

59:09.937 --> 59:11.177
Do you have any themes planned?

59:11.201 --> 59:12.742
Or, like, colors...

59:12.766 --> 59:13.830
Time to go.

59:13.854 --> 59:15.005
Hey, Bob, you just got here.

59:15.029 --> 59:16.465
I don't wanna leave yet.

59:19.599 --> 59:21.906
Sorry, just... forget about him.

59:35.789 --> 59:36.897
Oh, yeah, listen,

59:36.921 --> 59:37.985
Sharon's extended family

59:38.009 --> 59:39.329
could populate all
of Long Island.

59:40.011 --> 59:41.205
That's wonderful...

59:41.229 --> 59:42.685
Bobby... Bobby!

59:42.709 --> 59:43.860
Hey! Bobby!

59:43.884 --> 59:44.731
What are you doing? Let her go!

59:44.755 --> 59:46.036
What are you doing?

59:46.060 --> 59:48.299
Bobby!

59:48.323 --> 59:49.603
What the matter with you, Bobby?

59:51.675 --> 59:52.695
- Hey!
- Jimmy...

59:52.719 --> 59:54.479
Don't.

59:58.899 --> 01:00:00.640
Oh, my God, okay...

01:00:02.445 --> 01:00:03.445
I'm sor...

01:00:03.469 --> 01:00:05.795
Just don't say anything.

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:07.821
No, Kathie...

01:00:40.114 --> 01:00:42.571
I don't know what happened
to me last night.

01:00:42.595 --> 01:00:43.857
I...

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:49.230
I guess I see you and
your family together,

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:53.669
and you guys, you're just so...

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:55.540
happy.

01:00:55.564 --> 01:00:59.544
You're just happy.

01:00:59.568 --> 01:01:02.267
I never had that.

01:01:04.791 --> 01:01:06.987
Look...

01:01:07.011 --> 01:01:08.728
I know this doesn't
make up for what I did,

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:12.993
but I kinda got you something...

01:01:13.017 --> 01:01:15.672
that I thought would
look beautiful with you.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:32.839
I'm going to go to
medical school.

01:01:32.863 --> 01:01:35.692
I want to study pediatrics.

01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:39.783
Pediatrics...

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:48.376
Well, father will be pleased

01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.421
to have a doctor in the family,

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:51.988
and you know what,

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:55.102
you'll get to be with kids.

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:19.363
Did you find Anatomy 101?

01:02:19.387 --> 01:02:20.800
Um, yeah, it's right here.

01:02:20.824 --> 01:02:21.824
Thanks.

01:02:22.956 --> 01:02:24.131
Sure.

01:02:25.829 --> 01:02:27.632
Mark Bowen.

01:02:27.656 --> 01:02:28.938
Kathie.

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:30.482
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:43.518
Edward Michaels?

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.172
You were the doorman that was on

01:02:45.196 --> 01:02:47.435
the night that Kathie
Durst disappeared?

01:02:47.459 --> 01:02:49.611
Yeah, that was me.

01:02:49.635 --> 01:02:51.526
And you... you stated

01:02:51.550 --> 01:02:52.919
that you saw her that night?

01:02:52.943 --> 01:02:55.617
Is that correct?

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:58.794
I might've got that mixed up.

01:02:58.818 --> 01:03:00.013
I don't think I saw her.

01:03:00.037 --> 01:03:01.038
In fact, I know I didn't.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.539
What?

01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:07.847
I'm sorry, you... you
remember that now?

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.805
18 years later?

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:12.416
I was drinking on the
job back then, okay?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.505
So that night, I had left
my post for a while,

01:03:14.529 --> 01:03:16.551
and when the cops came askin',

01:03:16.575 --> 01:03:18.640
I had to say I saw her,

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:21.208
otherwise my boss
would've known I'd split.

01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:22.949
And besides, Mr.
Durst was so upset,

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:25.952
and he seemed so
convinced that she came,

01:03:25.976 --> 01:03:27.431
that I just went
with what he said.

01:03:27.455 --> 01:03:29.912
But for real,

01:03:29.936 --> 01:03:32.262
I never saw her.

01:03:32.286 --> 01:03:33.611
What?

01:03:33.635 --> 01:03:36.092
Yeah, he doesn't think
he saw her now.

01:03:36.116 --> 01:03:37.116
He made it up.

01:03:38.771 --> 01:03:40.227
She was never in Manhattan?

01:03:40.251 --> 01:03:42.427
No, I'm afraid not.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.138
I should have done more to
nail that son of a bitch.

01:04:03.404 --> 01:04:04.729
Hi.

01:04:04.753 --> 01:04:06.296
Is Dr. Bowen here?

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:07.539
He's right over there.

01:04:34.958 --> 01:04:36.413
Bobby, stop.

01:04:36.437 --> 01:04:37.937
I need rest.

01:04:37.961 --> 01:04:39.397
I have a final.

01:04:43.183 --> 01:04:46.119
I wanna feel something.

01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.645
Sometimes, I can't
feel anything,

01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:53.759
only what you feel.

01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:40.347
Let me guess...

01:05:40.371 --> 01:05:42.262
Fries. All of them.

01:05:42.286 --> 01:05:43.698
You never order your own.

01:05:43.722 --> 01:05:45.265
That's cause yours taste better.

01:05:45.289 --> 01:05:47.484
Mm-hmm.

01:05:51.295 --> 01:05:53.490
What?

01:05:53.514 --> 01:05:55.318
Nothing, I...

01:05:55.342 --> 01:05:56.387
Nothing.

01:06:13.404 --> 01:06:14.666
Bobby?

01:06:17.254 --> 01:06:18.254
Bobby...

01:06:18.278 --> 01:06:20.169
Bobby...

01:06:20.193 --> 01:06:21.257
Where's...

01:06:21.281 --> 01:06:22.717
Where's Igor?

01:06:24.328 --> 01:06:25.648
Bobby, you took him
down with you.

01:06:25.672 --> 01:06:29.135
Bobby, what did you do with him?

01:06:29.159 --> 01:06:31.224
Bobby!

01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:34.009
What did you do with him!

01:06:34.033 --> 01:06:35.426
Bobby!

01:06:44.522 --> 01:06:46.162
Ms. Durst, can I talk
to you for a second?

01:06:46.186 --> 01:06:46.891
Sure.

01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:47.980
Were you aware

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.244
that your account was past due?

01:06:49.268 --> 01:06:50.835
What?

01:06:56.925 --> 01:06:58.468
Robert...

01:06:58.492 --> 01:07:00.103
Why haven't you paid
for my tuition?

01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:06.172
Robert!

01:07:06.196 --> 01:07:07.956
When I am a doctor, I
will have my own money,

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:09.523
and you will never have
to pay for me ever again!

01:07:09.547 --> 01:07:11.090
Did you ever think about that?

01:07:11.114 --> 01:07:12.178
How about this,

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:12.917
why don't you ask your boyfriend

01:07:12.941 --> 01:07:14.049
to pay for it?

01:07:14.073 --> 01:07:15.007
Oh, this is what this is about?

01:07:15.031 --> 01:07:16.704
You are a hypocrite.

01:07:16.728 --> 01:07:17.879
You have had affairs!

01:07:17.903 --> 01:07:18.923
You...

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:22.690
You have something to say?

01:07:27.782 --> 01:07:29.001
Bobby!

01:07:33.092 --> 01:07:35.027
How long has he
been hitting you?

01:07:35.051 --> 01:07:37.681
I need you to be honest.

01:07:37.705 --> 01:07:39.988
Um, he's grabbed me before,

01:07:40.012 --> 01:07:41.163
but the slapping and hitting

01:07:41.187 --> 01:07:43.557
started a few months ago.

01:07:43.581 --> 01:07:45.776
After eight years of marriage?

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:48.281
So, what changed a
few months ago?

01:07:49.587 --> 01:07:51.110
I don't know.

01:07:52.503 --> 01:07:53.697
I can't do my job

01:07:53.721 --> 01:07:55.680
unless you tell me
everything, all right?

01:07:58.552 --> 01:08:01.053
Okay, I guess he found out
that I'm seeing someone,

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.142
but he's been cheating
on me for years.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.013
For years?

01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:06.188
And you stayed.

01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:07.212
Why?

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:18.287
I... I guess I just...

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:22.725
thought things would go back
to the way they were before.

01:08:22.750 --> 01:08:23.988
Kathie,

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:26.991
are you sure you're
ready for divorce?

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:28.515
I mean, the Durst family,

01:08:28.538 --> 01:08:30.219
they are not gonna make
this easy on you...

01:08:30.243 --> 01:08:30.952
Yes...

01:08:30.975 --> 01:08:32.171
You might still walk
away with nothing,

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:33.475
not even legal fees paid.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.500
I don't care.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.895
I want the divorce.

01:08:38.287 --> 01:08:40.395
All right, all right,
well, in that case,

01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:43.095
I suggest you get your
affairs in order,

01:08:43.118 --> 01:08:44.859
and you document the abuse.

01:09:17.283 --> 01:09:18.564
"Dear Mr. Durst,"

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.609
I'm writing in reference
to Robert Durst, age 11.

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.767
"Dr. Schonfeld's opinion was..."

01:10:45.676 --> 01:10:48.089
What if you get a
position in California?

01:10:48.113 --> 01:10:50.526
I don't know that yet.

01:10:50.550 --> 01:10:56.184
Well, what if you get
a position in Denver?

01:10:56.208 --> 01:10:58.471
You're married.

01:11:03.737 --> 01:11:05.585
I know.

01:11:05.609 --> 01:11:07.326
That can change.

01:11:07.350 --> 01:11:11.832
It will change once
I get my money.

01:11:13.486 --> 01:11:15.551
You're married now.

01:11:15.575 --> 01:11:18.902
Let's talk about now.

01:11:18.926 --> 01:11:21.340
I'm here,

01:11:21.364 --> 01:11:26.388
you're married.

01:11:26.412 --> 01:11:30.349
I wanna be with you.

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.113
You are with me.

01:11:53.047 --> 01:11:55.485
I thought you were at the lake.

01:12:06.539 --> 01:12:10.761
Did you send personal documents
to Senator Moynihan?

01:12:12.850 --> 01:12:14.939
Answer me.

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.266
Answer me!

01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:19.465
Just give me the divorce!

01:12:22.512 --> 01:12:24.011
Who else saw these documents?

01:12:24.035 --> 01:12:26.100
Who else did you send
these documents to?

01:12:26.124 --> 01:12:27.188
No one, I swear,

01:12:27.212 --> 01:12:29.146
I only sent out one envelope.

01:12:29.170 --> 01:12:31.235
I swear.

01:12:31.259 --> 01:12:34.369
Did you honestly think that
you could expose my family,

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:35.979
my father,

01:12:36.003 --> 01:12:38.199
without there being any
consequences at all?

01:12:38.223 --> 01:12:39.418
For the record,

01:12:39.442 --> 01:12:41.637
let me inform you about
what happened, okay?

01:12:41.661 --> 01:12:43.968
He sent them right back to
my father, who is not...

01:12:46.318 --> 01:12:47.928
No!

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:03.485
You don't leave me.

01:13:04.336 --> 01:13:06.643
You don't leave me.

01:13:15.913 --> 01:13:17.456
Did he use his fist? His hands?

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.351
Both.

01:13:21.527 --> 01:13:23.399
Anything else?

01:13:27.228 --> 01:13:28.467
Is Mark Bowen here?

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:29.903
Dr. Bowen?

01:13:29.927 --> 01:13:30.904
He left the hospital.

01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.712
He took a position in Denver.

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:42.437
Okay, but why do you
keep digging up

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:43.656
this old case?

01:13:43.680 --> 01:13:45.832
Young, beautiful
wife disappears?

01:13:45.856 --> 01:13:47.877
Guy's got millions,
nobody can find her?

01:13:47.901 --> 01:13:49.096
What is that?

01:13:49.120 --> 01:13:50.576
It's a waste of time.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.839
Look, cases like this
never get solved, man.

01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:54.231
Let me tell you something,

01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:56.016
you solve a case like this,

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:58.279
you give somebody else a
chance to keep going.

01:13:58.303 --> 01:14:01.828
For me, that's worth it.

01:14:03.874 --> 01:14:04.874
What the...

01:14:10.315 --> 01:14:12.012
Who the hell told the papers?

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:16.713
Now Durst knows.

01:14:18.146 --> 01:14:19.866
They said that they would
option the script,

01:14:19.890 --> 01:14:21.041
but you know how it goes.

01:14:21.065 --> 01:14:22.782
One exec says yes,
then they're fired,

01:14:22.806 --> 01:14:24.246
and the studio throws
everything out.

01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:25.160
So it didn't happen.

01:14:25.184 --> 01:14:25.915
Again.

01:14:25.939 --> 01:14:28.004
I was counting on that money.

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:30.188
It would have been enough to
float me till next summer,

01:14:30.212 --> 01:14:31.921
and by then I could
be back in New York.

01:14:31.945 --> 01:14:35.534
I'm sorry to hear about
your troubles, Suzy.

01:14:35.558 --> 01:14:36.752
I've been trying to reach
you for months, Bobby.

01:14:36.776 --> 01:14:38.537
You never pick up the phone.

01:14:38.561 --> 01:14:40.930
Yeah, you know, I'm busy.

01:14:40.954 --> 01:14:43.672
I'm working, I'm traveling...

01:14:43.696 --> 01:14:45.718
You haven't forgotten
your Suzy, have you?

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:47.154
No.

01:14:47.178 --> 01:14:49.112
We've been through
a lot together.

01:14:49.136 --> 01:14:50.505
I know, Suzy. I know.

01:14:50.529 --> 01:14:52.681
Who knows more
about you than me?

01:14:52.705 --> 01:14:54.533
Anyone know everything
about you like I do?

01:14:55.708 --> 01:14:56.816
Nobody.

01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:58.818
Haven't I been a good friend?

01:14:58.842 --> 01:15:00.234
Loyal?

01:15:02.759 --> 01:15:04.108
I'll get you that money, Susan.

01:15:05.892 --> 01:15:08.175
I knew that you would.

01:15:08.199 --> 01:15:10.418
Just... just send me a check.

01:15:12.899 --> 01:15:15.399
How about I give it
to you in person?

01:15:15.423 --> 01:15:17.010
Oh...

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:19.316
O-okay, sure.

01:15:19.340 --> 01:15:20.559
Okay.

01:15:22.518 --> 01:15:24.607
Thank you, honey.

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:36.377
I love you, honey.

01:15:36.401 --> 01:15:41.425
You'll always be my
sweet, precious baby.

01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:44.148
I don't feel so
precious anymore.

01:15:46.716 --> 01:15:49.521
You just have to have a
little faith, honey.

01:15:49.545 --> 01:15:52.349
In your marriage,

01:15:52.373 --> 01:15:54.874
in Bobby.

01:15:54.898 --> 01:15:59.792
Sometimes, he can be so nice.

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:02.732
Then he can be so awful.

01:16:04.429 --> 01:16:06.233
I know.

01:16:06.257 --> 01:16:11.543
I just believe that
people can change, honey.

01:16:11.567 --> 01:16:14.023
You have to have hope.

01:16:14.047 --> 01:16:16.310
Okay?

01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:19.638
Hey...

01:16:19.662 --> 01:16:21.596
I'm gonna make us
some tea, okay?

01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:22.839
Okay.

01:16:28.235 --> 01:16:29.715
I'll get it.

01:16:32.326 --> 01:16:33.326
Hello?

01:16:35.025 --> 01:16:36.393
It's me...

01:16:36.417 --> 01:16:40.354
Baby, I'm so sorry.

01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.225
I don't know how things
got so out of hand.

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:43.662
I don't...

01:16:45.601 --> 01:16:47.491
I...

01:16:47.515 --> 01:16:49.711
want this to work,

01:16:49.735 --> 01:16:51.408
and I...

01:16:51.432 --> 01:16:53.019
I think you and I

01:16:53.043 --> 01:16:54.803
should just go away for
the weekend together.

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:55.761
How does that sound?

01:16:55.785 --> 01:16:57.395
What do you think?

01:16:58.788 --> 01:17:00.833
Kathie?

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.002
When did you get him?

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.376
Last week.

01:17:23.943 --> 01:17:25.312
What's his name?

01:17:25.336 --> 01:17:26.642
Igor. What else?

01:17:49.729 --> 01:17:50.729
Where are you going?

01:17:50.753 --> 01:17:51.773
Out.

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:52.837
I thought we were gonna...

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:57.281
I know.

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:02.828
I won't let anything
bad happen to you.

01:18:08.727 --> 01:18:10.096
Hello.

01:18:10.120 --> 01:18:12.359
Hey, I'm having a big party.

01:18:12.383 --> 01:18:13.273
You have to come.

01:18:13.297 --> 01:18:14.840
Promise you'll come.

01:18:14.864 --> 01:18:16.450
Hi, hon'.

01:18:16.474 --> 01:18:17.756
You know what, um,

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.409
Bobby just stepped out,

01:18:19.433 --> 01:18:21.063
and we were supposed to talk,

01:18:21.087 --> 01:18:23.675
and I don't know
when he'll be back.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.024
Then come!

01:18:25.048 --> 01:18:26.614
Even for a little bit.

01:18:30.183 --> 01:18:31.857
You know, Kathie,

01:18:31.881 --> 01:18:32.988
he's never gonna change.

01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:33.946
You have to leave him.

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.077
I know.

01:18:35.101 --> 01:18:36.688
I'm not gonna let
him screw me over.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:39.125
No, you have to
demand what's yours.

01:18:39.149 --> 01:18:40.604
You put your foot down,

01:18:40.628 --> 01:18:41.649
and you tell him tonight.

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:44.086
Do it.

01:18:44.110 --> 01:18:45.827
Is there a Kathie here?

01:18:45.851 --> 01:18:47.350
Phone for you!

01:18:47.374 --> 01:18:48.574
Oh, my gosh, I bet that's him.

01:18:48.598 --> 01:18:50.687
You tell him right now.

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:53.017
I'm gonna tell him right now.

01:18:55.513 --> 01:18:57.360
- Hello?
- Hey.

01:18:57.384 --> 01:18:58.464
Bobby, yeah, we're gonna...

01:18:58.488 --> 01:18:59.536
Sweetheart, Kathie,

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:01.234
you were right, I was wrong.

01:19:01.258 --> 01:19:03.062
We should have talked, okay?

01:19:03.086 --> 01:19:03.976
Bobby...

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:04.933
Now, listen...

01:19:04.957 --> 01:19:06.587
No. No, you listen to me.

01:19:06.611 --> 01:19:08.197
You're drunk, Kathie, you're...

01:19:08.221 --> 01:19:09.285
No, Bobby,

01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:11.548
we're gonna talk
tonight, you and I.

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:12.593
Yes, we should talk.

01:19:12.617 --> 01:19:13.899
Listen to me...

01:19:13.923 --> 01:19:15.163
- You hear me? Okay?
- Listen...

01:19:15.187 --> 01:19:16.536
This is it.

01:19:27.501 --> 01:19:29.001
You can crash
heretonight, you know.

01:19:29.025 --> 01:19:30.872
I know. I'll be okay.

01:19:30.896 --> 01:19:31.830
Well, I'm proud of you.

01:19:31.854 --> 01:19:33.788
Be strong.

01:19:33.812 --> 01:19:35.572
Okay.

01:19:35.596 --> 01:19:36.617
I love you, Kathie.

01:19:36.641 --> 01:19:38.861
I love you, too, Berte.

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.212
Bye.

01:19:44.867 --> 01:19:46.042
Call you tomorrow.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:44.805
Becerra.

01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:46.589
Hey, listen, I've
been thinking, um...

01:22:46.613 --> 01:22:49.462
You need to talk to this
woman, Susan Berman.

01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:51.768
Um, I was around her, she's
gotta know something.

01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:53.031
She was Bobby's best friend.

01:22:53.055 --> 01:22:54.335
She was his
confidante, you know?

01:22:54.359 --> 01:22:56.251
Yeah, no, I know,
I'm already on it.

01:22:56.275 --> 01:22:58.036
I haven't been able
to get ahold of her.

01:22:58.060 --> 01:22:59.646
I'll try again right now.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.473
Thanks, Jim.

01:23:00.497 --> 01:23:01.715
Yeah, bye.

01:23:06.285 --> 01:23:08.655
Los Angeles Police Department.

01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:10.135
This is Investigator Becerra.

01:23:10.159 --> 01:23:12.093
Your office was
helping me locate

01:23:12.117 --> 01:23:13.921
Susan Berman's phone number.

01:23:13.945 --> 01:23:16.619
I'm just, I'm having a little
trouble getting through.

01:23:16.643 --> 01:23:18.404
One minute, please.

01:23:18.428 --> 01:23:20.406
Hi. This is Detective Simon.

01:23:20.430 --> 01:23:23.278
I'm sorry to tell you, but
Susan Berman is dead.

01:23:23.302 --> 01:23:24.497
She was murdered.

01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:25.802
What?

01:23:25.826 --> 01:23:27.674
You're kidding me.

01:23:27.698 --> 01:23:29.241
What happened?

01:23:29.265 --> 01:23:30.372
Shot in the back of the
head, execution style,

01:23:30.396 --> 01:23:31.417
a week ago.

01:23:31.441 --> 01:23:32.722
Nothing was stolen.

01:23:32.746 --> 01:23:34.420
Seems like it was
someone she knew.

01:23:34.444 --> 01:23:36.683
I wanted you all to hear
it from me first...

01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:40.730
Susan Berman is dead,
and Bobby's a suspect.

01:23:40.754 --> 01:23:43.298
There is a lot of evidence
that points to Durst.

01:23:43.322 --> 01:23:46.214
It's all circumstantial,
of course,

01:23:46.238 --> 01:23:48.521
but still,

01:23:48.545 --> 01:23:50.460
I think we're gonna
lock him up eventually.

01:23:52.244 --> 01:23:54.875
Ma, this is what we've
been waiting for.

01:23:54.899 --> 01:23:57.443
But do you think
they can prove it?

01:23:57.467 --> 01:24:01.664
It's just a matter of time
before he gives himself away.

01:24:01.688 --> 01:24:03.144
He'll make a mistake,

01:24:03.168 --> 01:24:04.537
he'll expose himself,

01:24:04.561 --> 01:24:06.495
and he will be stopped.
