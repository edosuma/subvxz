WEBVTT

00:00.968 --> 00:02.570
MAN: Previously on SWAT...

00:02.636 --> 00:03.904
MICHAEL: Jessica can't sleep
with one of her subordinates,

00:03.971 --> 00:05.239
and if you cared
about Jessica,

00:05.306 --> 00:06.774
you'd want to protect her.
I hate this.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.709
HONDO: The timing isn't right.
You got to do you,

00:08.776 --> 00:10.244
and you can't
do that with me.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.618
HICKS: 17-year-old young man,
Raymont Harris,

00:17.685 --> 00:19.853
was accidentally shot
and seriously injured

00:19.920 --> 00:21.455
by team leader Buck Spivey.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.158
Now, this morning,
I terminated Sergeant Spivey.

00:24.225 --> 00:25.326
HONDO: How far you
and Buck go back?

00:25.393 --> 00:26.994
He knew my mom.
Put her in prison.

00:27.061 --> 00:28.896
I've been watching Street,
and if I can't be here
to help him,

00:28.962 --> 00:30.198
I'm hoping you will.

00:33.334 --> 00:34.602
Come on, Boot.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.804
Or is everyone from
Hollywood Division this slow?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.739
I swear I trained him
better than this.

00:38.806 --> 00:39.940
HICKS: Witnesses saw a girl

00:40.007 --> 00:42.143
dragged from a car
registered to a Keri Sims,

00:42.210 --> 00:44.011
22-year-old
actress from Ohio.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.779
She fits the profile
of his other victims.

00:45.846 --> 00:47.648
The "Vanity Killer."
All the screenwriters in town,

00:47.715 --> 00:49.750
they can't come up with
a better name than that?

00:49.817 --> 00:50.951
Buck.
Sir.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.121
Robbery-Homicide's on site
with more details.

00:53.187 --> 00:54.655
All right.
We got to roll, people.

00:54.722 --> 00:55.923
You can cross your T's
in the truck.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.391
Where we headed?
Baldwin Village.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.993
We get this done in time, we
can hit Phillips on Crenshaw.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.563
What's Phillip's?
HONDO and JESSICA:
Best ribs in L.A.

01:02.630 --> 01:04.265
How you know my spot?
Girl's got to eat.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.106
Ninety-six seconds.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.442
I think we can
get it down under 90.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.843
Only two weeks
on the job,

01:15.909 --> 01:17.378
and already pushing
for better.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.113
I like the ambition,
Cortez.

01:24.084 --> 01:27.121
I've had eight bodies turn up
within a mile of this spot
since August.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.889
Don't know diddly
about the killer,

01:28.956 --> 01:31.625
but Forensics says that
all the vics were locked up
someplace damp,

01:31.692 --> 01:33.694
cold and full of asbestos
before they died.

01:33.761 --> 01:35.463
And you think this building's
where your guy's
been keeping them?

01:35.529 --> 01:38.632
The girl that was seen
dragged inside
fits his M.O. to a T.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.335
You couple that
with the location,
the reinforced steel doors,

01:41.402 --> 01:42.536
it's the best lead
I've had so far.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.037
He expecting us?
Shouldn't be.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.573
We kept our distance.

01:45.639 --> 01:47.541
Didn't want to spook him
with a possible
live victim inside.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.144
If he keeps his prisoners
alive for a while,
why not just wait him out?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.712
He tortures his victims
for weeks,

01:51.779 --> 01:53.046
I got no proof
he ever leaves them alone.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.248
You really want
to set up camp

01:54.315 --> 01:55.849
while he slow kills
an innocent?

01:55.916 --> 01:58.118
We'll bring him down.
Thank you, Detective.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.421
Okay, Hondo, Luca, Red Team,
you're with me.

02:00.488 --> 02:02.490
Deacon, you're
Blue Team with Chris and Tan.

02:02.556 --> 02:04.558
Stay liquid, fill the gaps.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.260
This is why we're here.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.038
CHRIS: It's dark.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.873
We got eyes,
but it's dark on our end.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.375
Nothing moving.
We're dark, too.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.277
Blowing the door. Go!

02:26.146 --> 02:27.415
Red Team is in.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.916
Blue Team
securing the rear.

02:32.220 --> 02:33.621
Give me two!

02:35.356 --> 02:37.291
Left side clear!
Right side clear!

02:37.358 --> 02:38.926
HONDO: Give me two!
Give me two!

02:41.762 --> 02:42.863
Right side clear!

02:42.930 --> 02:44.097
Left side clear!
We're clear!

02:44.164 --> 02:45.399
Give me two!
Let's go.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.600
Going right.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.239
Left side clear!
Right side clear!

02:52.373 --> 02:53.674
Hands!

02:54.308 --> 02:55.409
Running!

02:55.476 --> 02:56.544
He's here.
On my way.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.111
Chris and Tan
have the rear secure.

03:01.915 --> 03:02.916
I got left!

03:02.983 --> 03:04.352
Hang on!
I got right!

03:13.527 --> 03:15.629
Luca, get her out of here.
Hondo, with me.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.467
It's okay. I got you.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.504
It's Keri, right? You're
gonna come with me, okay?
Uh-huh.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.273
Come on.
No. What about him?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.577
Trailers!
I need trailers!

03:29.643 --> 03:31.144
DEACON: En route to assist.
Come here.

03:41.689 --> 03:43.156
We got trip wire.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.492
Yeah.

03:52.666 --> 03:53.901
Hang on there, buddy.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.612
He's got enough C-4
to blow the entire building.

04:04.678 --> 04:05.913
HARWELL:
Better back off.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.148
Pull back.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.186
Wire.

04:18.225 --> 04:20.461
We got explosives! Evacuate!

04:20.528 --> 04:22.129
Everybody out now!

04:22.195 --> 04:24.298
I'm waiting on trailers.
I got a second victim here.

04:24.365 --> 04:25.699
DEACON: Entering
the building now.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.968
BUCK: Negative, Deac!
This place is about to blow!

04:28.035 --> 04:29.503
Luca, get out, now!

04:29.570 --> 04:32.706
Please. Help me.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.207
Look, give me
two minutes, okay?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.044
In two minutes,
you'll all be charcoal.
Evacuate now, Luca!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.512
That's an order!

04:42.650 --> 04:44.718
Hey. I'll come back for you.

04:45.819 --> 04:46.820
I promise.

04:48.822 --> 04:51.258
Come on. Come on!

04:54.528 --> 04:57.598
I got a live victim
and a stack of explosives.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.900
I need that bomb squad
yesterday!

05:07.641 --> 05:10.544
Hey. Come on!
Come on! Let's go!

05:10.611 --> 05:12.179
I got her. I got her.
You'll be safe here, okay?

05:12.245 --> 05:14.047
I got her.
Luca, stop!

05:14.114 --> 05:15.282
There's still a man in there!

05:34.668 --> 05:37.237
Look, one bedroom,
washer-dryer...

05:37.304 --> 05:38.572
Not that you'd use them.

05:38.639 --> 05:39.940
Why are you so snarky?

05:40.007 --> 05:41.575
It's not like your socks
smell any better.

05:41.642 --> 05:43.276
Because I eat on
that table, Luca.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.446
It's been four months.
Don't you want your own place?

05:45.513 --> 05:46.547
Ooh!

05:46.614 --> 05:48.115
Benji's Bakery booth.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.451
Their chocolate croissants
will change your life.
No.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.119
Come on. It's my treat.
I just want...

05:53.687 --> 05:55.923
STREET: We're not
stopping for pastries.

05:55.989 --> 05:58.392
No. Forget the pastries.
Follow me.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.193
What's up? You want to
tell me what this is about?

06:00.260 --> 06:01.695
Hey, remember
a couple years ago,

06:01.762 --> 06:03.764
that psycho that was
cutting up
all the pretty people?

06:03.831 --> 06:05.433
STREET: Yeah, his victims
were all, like,

06:05.499 --> 06:07.267
L.A. newcomers chasing
Hollywood dreams, right?

06:07.334 --> 06:09.036
Yeah, exactly.
"Vanity Killer."

06:10.037 --> 06:11.071
STREET:
What about him?

06:11.138 --> 06:13.140
WOMAN:
Namaste. Thank you.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.544
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Sorry. Sorry.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.078
Excuse me, excuse me.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.651
That's him. Hey!

06:25.018 --> 06:26.353
Hey!

06:33.527 --> 06:34.962
Damn it!

07:09.863 --> 07:13.233
Hey, Buck, it's Hondo, man.
I've left a few of these now.

07:13.300 --> 07:15.703
Appreciate a call back.
I'm here at your house,

07:15.769 --> 07:17.471
but it doesn't look like
you've been here in a while.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.972
Let me know if you're out of
town or something, all right?

07:31.318 --> 07:32.686
Buck?

07:40.861 --> 07:42.295
Buck?

07:57.144 --> 07:58.512
Hey, Luca. What's up?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.213
Hey, you won't believe
who I just saw.

08:00.280 --> 08:02.950
Remember that sicko that
nearly blew us up two years
ago in Baldwin Village?

08:03.016 --> 08:04.051
The serial killer?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.418
He's alive, bro,
and he's here.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.887
I almost had him.
HONDO: All right,
wait a minute.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.589
What happened?
What makes you
think it was him?

08:08.656 --> 08:11.291
No, I don't think.
I know. Trust me.
I got his plate number.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.493
We got to get with that
detective working the case.

08:13.561 --> 08:15.596
Text me his plate number.
Okay.

08:18.198 --> 08:21.301
(INDISTINCT
POLICE RADIO CHATTER)

08:21.368 --> 08:22.936
Somebody get caught cheating
with their secretary?

08:23.003 --> 08:24.572
Both single, but
we'll probably find

08:24.638 --> 08:26.607
a jealous somebody
somewhere.

08:26.674 --> 08:29.242
You were pretty cryptic on the
phone. What brings you to me?

08:29.309 --> 08:34.081
I got a call from
one of my guys who swears he
just saw the Vanity Killer.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.283
He blew himself up.
Y... You were there.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.385
He blew the building.
Forensics never found
his remains.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.853
Well, the killings stopped,
didn't they?

08:39.920 --> 08:41.722
My guy is not the type
to cry wolf.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.957
Got a 20 on this guy?
I just got a plate number.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.860
Hondo, I got a backlog longer
than the lines at Disneyland.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.729
I can't let
warm bodies go cold

08:48.796 --> 08:50.130
just 'cause your guy
thinks he saw a ghost.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.732
I'm not asking you
to do the legwork.

08:51.799 --> 08:54.067
Just send over
the Homicide case file.
Let me take a look.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.636
Hell, if you want to play
detective on your day off,

08:55.703 --> 08:56.970
I'll give you access
to the whole system.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.439
You get me a good lead,
and I'll make time to work it.

08:59.506 --> 09:00.741
All right.
That's all I ask.
All right.

09:00.808 --> 09:01.975
Appreciate it.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.617
Okay? So make sure
you keep your elbows tight

09:09.683 --> 09:11.685
when you're going in
for the clench.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.554
Okay. Pair up and practice.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.259
Hey.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.629
Hey.
God, what
an awesome surprise.

09:21.695 --> 09:22.896
You're looking fierce.

09:22.963 --> 09:24.331
Do you want to help
with some demos?
No.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.266
I'd love to,
but I'm actually here

09:26.333 --> 09:28.001
with some pretty
serious news.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.004
I saw him today.

09:31.071 --> 09:33.573
Down by the marina.
He got away.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.909
Um, come here.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.147
Um...

09:40.213 --> 09:41.782
Like him, him?

09:41.849 --> 09:43.216
Yeah.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.319
He's dead.
We saw the explosion.

09:46.386 --> 09:49.022
I don't know how,
but... it was him.

09:50.557 --> 09:52.492
Look, we're gonna be all
over this, I promise you that,

09:52.559 --> 09:56.697
but it might be good
if you hang at the station
till we get him.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.398
If he thinks the
heat's back on,

09:58.465 --> 09:59.933
and he knows
you can I.D. him...

10:01.401 --> 10:02.770
It's just better
to play it safe.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.406
Yeah, of course.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.077
Okay, I'm gonna
get my stuff.
Okay.

10:15.548 --> 10:17.117
Wendy.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.551
Hey.
Hey, Hondo.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.953
I thought your team
was down today.
Oh, we are.

10:20.020 --> 10:22.890
I just came in to help Luca
with something. Listen, um...

10:22.956 --> 10:24.357
I know Buck's been
coming to see you

10:24.424 --> 10:25.959
ever since the
Raymont Harris shooting.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.594
I'm just wondering if
he's doing all right lately.

10:27.661 --> 10:28.829
I'm a little worried
about him.

10:28.896 --> 10:30.263
Well, the whole
doctor-patient thing

10:30.330 --> 10:32.165
keeps my lips pretty tight,
but I am getting concerned.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.034
He was doing great,

10:34.101 --> 10:36.036
then he missed his last
two therapy sessions.

10:36.103 --> 10:37.537
Did he give you a reason?
Nope.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.739
He, uh,
didn't cancel them.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.340
He just didn't show up.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.508
Haven't heard
a word from him.

10:41.574 --> 10:43.877
I was actually gonna
ask you about him.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.279
All right, thanks. Will you
let me know if he calls?

10:46.346 --> 10:47.547
If you promise
to do the same.

10:47.614 --> 10:48.648
Of course.
Okay.

10:51.685 --> 10:53.253
HICKS: "You need to change
your tune, lady,

10:53.320 --> 10:55.388
before somebody gets hurt,
like you."

10:55.455 --> 10:56.724
Hmm.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.058
Where was this, exactly?

10:58.125 --> 10:59.827
Right here on my desk.

10:59.893 --> 11:02.162
Last week,
your car gets vandalized,
now you're getting threats.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.630
You pissed
a lot of people off

11:03.697 --> 11:05.632
with that police
accountability proposal.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.769
No address,
just my name on the envelope.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.237
Someone delivered
it personally.

11:10.303 --> 11:11.471
Well, you were
off yesterday,

11:11.538 --> 11:13.206
so it was someone
who swiped into the building

11:13.273 --> 11:14.307
in the last 36 hours.

11:14.374 --> 11:15.909
Hard to believe
one of our officers

11:15.976 --> 11:17.377
would stoop
to an anonymous threat.

11:17.444 --> 11:18.779
I don't want to tell you
I told you so, but...

11:18.846 --> 11:19.913
Sounds like you just did.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.181
I'm gonna get
threat management

11:21.248 --> 11:22.382
to launch an
investigation.

11:22.449 --> 11:25.018
Meanwhile, I want
an R-100 security detail

11:25.085 --> 11:26.486
shadowing you
around the clock.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.756
Sir, I'd like the chance
to address our teams first.

11:28.822 --> 11:30.423
You already got a target
on your back, Jessica,

11:30.490 --> 11:32.860
you go barking at the troops,
you're only gonna
make it bigger.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.295
I'm not asking you
to hold up the investigation.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.164
Just keep things quiet
until the end of today.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.668
All right, I don't want you
leaving the building
without an escort.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.503
I'm not taking
any chances with this.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.005
Understood.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.612
Hey. I hope it's cool,
I brought a guest.

11:52.679 --> 11:54.581
This young lady
is always welcome.

11:54.647 --> 11:58.151
Keri, oh, how you doing?
I'm digging the new-look.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.821
Yeah, not after the same
kind of attention
I used to be, so...

12:00.888 --> 12:03.056
Figured she'd be
safer here with us.
Of course.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.992
So, you get with
Detective Rose?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.827
Yeah, yeah, but he's
stretched pretty thin,

12:06.894 --> 12:08.461
so for the moment,
we're flying solo.

12:08.528 --> 12:10.363
What? How-how is this
not a priority?

12:10.430 --> 12:12.465
Once we get something
solid, it will be.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.267
Okay, you get anything
off the plate?

12:14.334 --> 12:16.136
Well, the license
links to a bunk car.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.504
It was impounded months ago.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.706
But Rose plugged me into
his vehicle tracking system,

12:19.773 --> 12:20.974
and I think I might
have something.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.642
All right,
this system's pretty dope.

12:22.709 --> 12:25.478
City's got cameras all over
that automatically record
license plates.

12:25.545 --> 12:27.781
Like hidden cameras?
Cameras in squad cars,

12:27.848 --> 12:30.150
traffic cams,
those little
parking ticket carts.

12:30.217 --> 12:32.019
If you plug in a plate number
and a time frame,

12:32.085 --> 12:34.287
the system will tell you
anywhere that car
was recorded.

12:34.354 --> 12:35.789
So I plugged in the plate
Luca gave me,

12:35.856 --> 12:38.325
and it actually came up a half
a dozen times this morning,

12:38.391 --> 12:39.860
but it went silent
an hour ago.

12:39.927 --> 12:42.529
It was last tagged on a side
street in North Hollywood.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.731
That means it's got to be
parked somewhere close by,
then, right?

12:44.798 --> 12:46.834
If the car's still moving,
the system should
pick it back up.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.802
Well, great. Let's call Rose.
Let's go get him, man.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.138
Hey, Luca, slow down.
We got to get eyes on this guy

12:51.204 --> 12:53.673
and be 100 it's him
before we go back to RHD.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.442
I am a hundred.

13:00.647 --> 13:02.715
All right, let's go get him.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.284
Keri, is it cool if you
chill here for a bit?

13:04.351 --> 13:06.719
Yeah. Is it okay
if I use your gym?
Knock yourself out.

13:12.826 --> 13:14.327
You know, Luca,
that's quite an eye you got,

13:14.394 --> 13:15.528
spotting him after so long,

13:15.595 --> 13:16.763
especially when we all
thought he was dead.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.865
No, I never thought that.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.466
How come you're so sure
about this?

13:19.532 --> 13:22.402
Hondo, I had this guy's sketch
on my fridge for two years.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.670
I'd know his face anywhere.

13:23.736 --> 13:25.305
I would've put it up
at Street's place

13:25.372 --> 13:26.874
if he wasn't so touchy
about his pad.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.242
He's not an easy guy to live
with, by the way, trust me.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.378
Oh, he's the pain-in-the-ass
roommate, not you?

13:31.444 --> 13:33.146
Wait a minute. You're still
bunking at Street's?

13:33.213 --> 13:34.915
Yeah.
Oh, I got to buy
that kid a beer.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.549
He just set a new record.
He plays like

13:36.616 --> 13:38.051
he's done with it,
but I don't think

13:38.118 --> 13:39.186
he really wants me to leave.

13:40.921 --> 13:42.589
How'd you find Keri so fast?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.524
We keep in touch.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.560
You know, I mean,
we were both pretty
rattled after that night.

13:47.627 --> 13:48.929
Changed her life.

13:48.996 --> 13:50.797
Took that poor girl's
dreams away.

13:51.965 --> 13:54.167
Sometimes it's good
to talk to each other.

13:55.402 --> 13:57.704
You know that bastard
made her watch

13:57.770 --> 13:59.372
as he tortured the other guy?

13:59.439 --> 14:01.774
He told Keri the only way
that he'd stop

14:01.841 --> 14:03.643
is if she killed
the guy herself.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.882
There. That's the car!

14:14.321 --> 14:16.256
This is Sergeant Harrelson,
requesting assistance

14:16.323 --> 14:17.590
with a suspicious vehicle.

14:25.498 --> 14:26.967
JIM:
That you, Lance?

14:28.035 --> 14:30.470
Stop playing around.
You're late enough.

14:32.672 --> 14:34.474
Wha...

14:35.442 --> 14:37.110
Guessing neither of you
is Lance.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.678
We're Metro SWAT.
Who's Lance?

14:38.745 --> 14:40.380
The-the guy I'm waiting
to shoot.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.482
Is he a big guy?
Drives a gray SUV?

14:42.549 --> 14:44.784
No, he's pretty and broke.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.053
He drives
an old beater.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.787
He's also two hours late
and not answering calls.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.122
He's not answering his phone?

14:49.189 --> 14:51.291
Even his agent can't find him,
which is weird,

14:51.358 --> 14:53.260
'cause nobody at his level
ignores their agent.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.028
Right?

14:57.197 --> 14:59.666
HONDO: Name's Lance Roy.
I need a 20 on his cell phone,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.134
personal vehicle,
whatever you can get me.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.503
Guy must've seen me
clock him at the park,

15:03.570 --> 15:05.338
ditched his ride to be safe.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.807
Yeah, but not his plan
to snatch another victim.

15:07.874 --> 15:10.277
Probably tracking this
Lance guy for weeks.

15:10.343 --> 15:12.779
I'll bet he was in
that yoga class.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.114
The killer knew
he'd be here, too,

15:14.181 --> 15:15.782
so he kidnapped him
in his own car.

15:19.219 --> 15:20.820
You hear that?
Yeah.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.500
Luca.
Yeah.

15:37.737 --> 15:38.905
Yep, that's his agent.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.545
I'm really starting to wish
you weren't right about this.

15:45.612 --> 15:47.314
Yep, you and me both.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.092
Any idea what this
is all about?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.194
No idea.
But seems pretty major.

16:01.261 --> 16:03.663
Luca told us what's up
with that psycho resurfacing.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.098
Yeah. We want to help.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.933
All of us.
I knew you would.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.868
I'll bring you all up to speed
when whatever this is
wraps up.

16:08.935 --> 16:10.737
Listen up!

16:10.803 --> 16:12.172
Thank you for coming in,

16:12.239 --> 16:14.641
especially those who were
scheduled to have the day off.

16:14.707 --> 16:18.511
Unfortunately, we're here
to discuss the actions
of someone in this unit.

16:18.578 --> 16:22.015
This morning,
Captain Cortez found
a letter on her desk

16:22.082 --> 16:24.251
posing an anonymous threat
to her safety.

16:24.317 --> 16:26.586
Captain Cortez would like
to address you directly.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.954
Captain.

16:31.258 --> 16:34.927
Many of you don't agree
with my recent police
accountability proposals,

16:34.994 --> 16:36.196
and that's fine.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.765
But first,
I had my tires slashed,

16:38.831 --> 16:41.368
and now I've been
personally threatened.

16:41.434 --> 16:45.772
I became a police officer
because I believe
in what that stands for.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.840
I know most of you
feel the same.

16:47.907 --> 16:51.744
Most of you would
have no tolerance
for something like this.

16:51.811 --> 16:53.146
So here's my offer,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.282
if the person who wrote
the letter comes forward

16:55.348 --> 16:59.119
in the next hour,
we talk this out, one on one.

16:59.186 --> 17:00.853
If not,

17:00.920 --> 17:03.022
it becomes
a criminal investigation.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.231
Nobody liked those proposals,
but this is a disgrace.

17:11.298 --> 17:12.932
Thought the captain
handled herself well.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.767
More tolerant
than I would've been.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.372
A threat from inside SWAT?

17:20.373 --> 17:21.708
This is crazy.

17:21.774 --> 17:22.875
You don't pull
a stunt like that

17:22.942 --> 17:24.744
and get to call
yourself an officer.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.613
You imagine what
Buck would say?

17:26.679 --> 17:28.948
He'd be the first one
wanting to swing the ax.

17:30.049 --> 17:31.351
Have you heard
from him lately?

17:31.418 --> 17:35.122
Uh, we caught a pay-per-view
fight a couple weeks back.

17:35.188 --> 17:36.289
Why?

17:36.356 --> 17:37.790
No, it's probably nothing.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.025
I stopped by his place,
but it looked like

17:39.092 --> 17:40.293
he hadn't been there
in a while.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.628
He's not returning
any calls.

17:41.694 --> 17:43.496
You try Long Beach?
What's in Long Beach?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.498
He's got, like,
a couple hangouts there

17:45.565 --> 17:47.500
he heads to
when he wants to unplug.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.935
That's mostly
where I used to see him.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.970
I just saw something
that's got me worried.

17:51.037 --> 17:53.473
I think he might be
having some type
of financial trouble.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.442
Do you mind
trying to find him?
Make sure he's all right?

17:55.508 --> 17:57.043
Yeah, of course.
Anything for Buck.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.378
Okay.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.282
Hey.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.152
You okay?

18:05.218 --> 18:08.321
Not exactly the way
I wanted to start my week.

18:08.388 --> 18:10.390
Why didn't you tell me?

18:10.457 --> 18:13.025
Because that's not
who we are now.
Hey.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.927
A threat like this could
be really serious.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.929
It's just a cop
blowing off steam.

18:16.996 --> 18:18.398
You don't know that.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.533
Let me stop by after work
and check up on you.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.868
I want to read this
letter for myself.

18:25.438 --> 18:26.939
You finally got it.

18:27.006 --> 18:28.408
SWAT eagle.
Yeah.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.643
I promised myself I would
if I ever made 20-David.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.480
I just, wanted to make sure
I could hold on to the job.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.584
Well, I guess you still need
to pick up your stuff

18:37.650 --> 18:39.319
from my place anyway.

18:39.386 --> 18:40.520
I'll stop by later tonight.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.054
Okay.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.995
Trying to make the rest of us
look lazy, or what?

18:51.731 --> 18:53.166
Just getting my sweat on.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.667
Was that big meeting
about our guy?

18:54.734 --> 18:57.804
No, it was something else. Um,
we did get some news, though.

18:59.071 --> 19:00.707
We think he grabbed
someone new.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.175
When

19:02.242 --> 19:03.476
Couple hours ago.

19:05.478 --> 19:09.449
I keep thinking,
what if he sped things up
'cause he saw me this morning?

19:09.516 --> 19:12.018
No, Luca,
you can't blame yourself.
It's all on him.

19:12.084 --> 19:13.886
I just don't want him
taking another life.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.122
Anything I can
do to help?
Yeah, maybe.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.058
If you're up for it.

19:19.125 --> 19:21.228
We got your statement
from the file,

19:21.294 --> 19:23.863
but I know a lot
of times, um,

19:23.930 --> 19:27.166
details, they don't
come back till later.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.868
And I don't want
to make you relive anything

19:28.935 --> 19:30.737
that you're
uncomfortable with,

19:30.803 --> 19:32.305
but if you're willing,

19:32.372 --> 19:35.074
we got someone
you can sit down with.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.943
You never know
what you might remember.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.013
Okay, Keri,
this isn't official.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.549
Absolutely no pressure.

19:42.615 --> 19:44.451
Just share whatever
you can recall

19:44.517 --> 19:45.752
and whatever
you're comfortable with.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.787
Yeah, of course.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.558
Maybe what we should do
is start from when
you were first taken.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.865
Um, I was still new here.

19:58.931 --> 20:01.768
I was still trying
to get my face on billboards,

20:01.834 --> 20:03.270
you know, get movie roles.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.873
Now half the time,
I wish I was invisible.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.908
I was coming out
of an audition

20:08.975 --> 20:11.511
when he stopped me,
and he said he was

20:11.578 --> 20:14.013
with the casting director and
they needed an extra headshot.

20:15.582 --> 20:19.352
Um, I thought that was weird,
but hopefully a good thing.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.155
You know, had one
in the car, so why not?

20:23.222 --> 20:26.158
But when I opened the door,
he pointed a gun at me,

20:26.225 --> 20:29.095
uh, told me to get in.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.231
Uh, and then
he handcuffed
my wrists and ankles,

20:32.299 --> 20:34.000
and we drove off.

20:34.066 --> 20:36.369
He kept me face down,
in the back.

20:36.436 --> 20:41.073
And I kept thinking, I should
have fought to get away,

20:42.375 --> 20:43.776
I should have
made him shoot me.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.547
But it was too late.

20:47.614 --> 20:51.017
He took me to a place
that smelled like...

20:52.419 --> 20:53.653
Vomit.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.623
There was a another prisoner
there, a man.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.791
He was chained
to a wall.

20:58.858 --> 21:00.627
There were, um,
half-eaten burritos

21:00.693 --> 21:02.995
and-and gas station
food wrappers everywhere.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.163
That's all he fed us.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.500
He said he'd like
to watch me eat,

21:07.567 --> 21:11.504
but that tonight
we'd watch the man
die instead.

21:11.571 --> 21:14.106
He, uh, tortured him
for hours.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.110
I begged him to stop.

21:19.412 --> 21:21.047
I'm sorry. I know
none of this is helpful.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.850
No, no, no.
You don't need to apologize.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.518
Your bravery
is an inspiration.

21:26.719 --> 21:27.854
Thank you.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.022
You did great.
Yeah.

21:30.089 --> 21:32.124
You guys being here
means a lot.

21:32.191 --> 21:33.493
We don't get enough
days off as it is.

21:33.560 --> 21:35.127
I was knee-deep
in diapers anyway.

21:35.194 --> 21:36.463
Yeah, and if I have
to hear about

21:36.529 --> 21:38.030
my Uncle Wiso's plastic hip
one more time,

21:38.097 --> 21:40.199
I might just have to
break his other one.

21:40.266 --> 21:43.169
Well, meanwhile, me and Luca
spent the morning
chasing down his hunch.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.372
And it turns out,
it's a pretty good one.

21:45.438 --> 21:49.041
A killer that we thought
was dead is still out there.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.309
Now, we got to do
whatever we can

21:50.377 --> 21:52.178
to find this guy before
he takes another life.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.946
Did you get anything
off the SUV he ditched?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.615
Forensics is swabbing
for DNA and fingerprints,

21:55.682 --> 21:56.883
but that's gonna
take some time.

21:56.949 --> 21:58.851
Meanwhile, we think
the killer might be using

21:58.918 --> 22:01.754
a 2001 CR-V
registered to a Lance Roy.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.423
Now, this Lance,
he's good kid.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.057
He was a volunteer firefighter
back in Iowa

22:05.124 --> 22:06.693
before he decided
to come to Hollywood

22:06.759 --> 22:08.628
and try to be somebody
in the biz.

22:08.695 --> 22:10.697
Now, his car has no GPS,
and the plate tracker

22:10.763 --> 22:11.798
hasn't dinged
since this morning.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.032
Anything else to go on?

22:13.099 --> 22:15.435
I tracked
the suspect's abandoned SUV

22:15.502 --> 22:16.636
for the past two weeks,

22:16.703 --> 22:18.638
back before he knew
we were onto him.

22:18.705 --> 22:20.039
He was rolling around
during the day,

22:20.106 --> 22:21.608
but he was also tagged
days and nights

22:21.674 --> 22:23.810
going in and out
of Agoura Hills.

22:23.876 --> 22:25.745
Big area to canvass.
We know anything
about his habits?

22:25.812 --> 22:27.380
Could be a regular
at a coffee shop or at a bar?

22:27.447 --> 22:29.416
Hey.
Hey.

22:29.482 --> 22:31.384
How'd it go with Keri?
That girl's a rock.

22:31.451 --> 22:32.919
Can't imagine what
she's been through.

22:32.985 --> 22:33.986
What's this?

22:34.053 --> 22:35.087
We think our suspect
might live

22:35.154 --> 22:36.656
somewhere in this area.
Nice.

22:36.723 --> 22:38.090
I got something
that might help.

22:38.157 --> 22:40.993
Keri said that the guy only
fed the victims junk food

22:41.060 --> 22:43.796
from, like, gas stations
or convenience stores.

22:43.863 --> 22:46.265
Well, it's only convenient
if it's close to home.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.369
* Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

22:50.437 --> 22:53.606
* What condition
my condition was in

22:55.975 --> 22:59.311
* I woke up this morning
with the sundown

22:59.378 --> 23:01.548
* Shining in

23:04.083 --> 23:09.021
* I found my mind
in a brown paper bag within...

23:10.923 --> 23:12.759
You know, when someone
turns their phone off,

23:12.825 --> 23:15.027
it's usually not code for,
"Hey, come find me."

23:15.094 --> 23:17.196
Maybe I'm just here to bowl.
Nice shoes.

23:24.303 --> 23:26.739
So, uh, how's tricks?

23:27.774 --> 23:28.808
Everything good?

23:28.875 --> 23:30.443
Oh, yeah. Never better.

23:30.510 --> 23:32.812
Is that why you're bowling
alone in Long Beach?

23:32.879 --> 23:34.847
It's a perk of retirement.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.219
So, I see you still
suck at this.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.821
I had a horrible teacher.

23:42.555 --> 23:43.823
Hey, uh,

23:43.890 --> 23:45.758
something going on
between you and Hondo?

23:45.825 --> 23:48.060
He said that you're not
returning his calls.

23:50.396 --> 23:52.198
I guess you two
are getting on now?

23:52.264 --> 23:53.666
Oh, what makes
you say that?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.468
Well, Hondo's not the kind
of guy to ask for help.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.236
He wouldn't
send you to find me
if he didn't trust you.

23:57.303 --> 24:01.340
Unless he's just so worried
that he didn't have a choice.

24:01.407 --> 24:03.042
Worried about what, exactly?

24:03.109 --> 24:05.211
Just... How you're doing.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.913
If you're getting by.

24:08.615 --> 24:11.217
Maybe he thinks
you're in some sort
of financial trouble.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.384
There you go.

24:17.557 --> 24:20.092
Guess I
shouldn't have told him
where I keep the spare key.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.894
Well, you disappeared.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.963
Would you rather
none of us cared?

24:32.572 --> 24:35.141
So, you want to tell me
what happened?
You bent your wrist.

24:38.878 --> 24:39.879
Fine. Um...

24:41.914 --> 24:44.250
So, I had a chunk of money
I wanted to be

24:44.316 --> 24:45.885
a little bit
more aggressive with.

24:45.952 --> 24:48.821
Uh, had a clock on it.

24:48.888 --> 24:50.823
You know, so I, uh...
I found a start-up company,

24:50.890 --> 24:52.424
you know,
looked promising.

24:52.491 --> 24:56.195
I-I took a gamble on it,
and I, uh, I lost.

24:56.262 --> 24:57.964
That's-that's the end
of the story.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.132
What do you mean
it had a clock on it?

25:00.199 --> 25:03.069
You just don't let up, do you?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.837
Somehow you love me for it.

25:04.904 --> 25:06.606
I spent my life
serving the city,

25:06.673 --> 25:08.440
and I undid everything
I had accomplished

25:08.507 --> 25:09.909
with a single mistake.

25:16.983 --> 25:18.551
Talking about
that kid you shot?

25:18.618 --> 25:20.219
Raymont Harris.

25:20.286 --> 25:23.990
Yeah, I wanted to
pay off his college tuition
anonymously,

25:24.056 --> 25:25.858
but I-I screwed that up, too.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.928
But, hey, I can
still bowl a 200.

25:33.299 --> 25:36.302
Did I ever tell you
about the time

25:36.368 --> 25:39.305
my mom shot my dad dead
when I was 12,

25:39.371 --> 25:41.273
and the arresting officer
sat me down for a little talk?

25:41.340 --> 25:42.642
That where you learned
to stick your nose

25:42.709 --> 25:43.743
in other people's business?

25:43.810 --> 25:45.077
Probably.

25:45.144 --> 25:46.713
Anyway, he said something

25:46.779 --> 25:49.348
that really,
really stuck with me.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.184
You're gonna
throw my own words
back at me right now?

25:52.251 --> 25:54.954
He said sometimes
you get kicked in the teeth,

25:55.021 --> 25:56.989
and it hurts like hell,

25:57.056 --> 25:59.792
but life is not about
how many blows you take.

25:59.859 --> 26:01.360
It is about
how hard you hit back.

26:01.427 --> 26:03.562
You were a kid back then,
right, and I was a cop

26:03.630 --> 26:05.364
who still had
a lot of fight in him.

26:05.431 --> 26:06.633
Things are different now.

26:06.699 --> 26:10.102
How? You just got to stop
beating yourself up.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.470
You got to get back
in the fight.

26:11.537 --> 26:13.372
Look, I appreciate you coming
down here to set me straight.

26:13.439 --> 26:15.141
I do.
But I'm just not interested

26:15.207 --> 26:17.143
in throwing
any more punches, Jimmy.

26:17.209 --> 26:18.377
I'm done.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.579
What am I supposed
to tell Hondo?

26:20.647 --> 26:22.682
Well, you tell Hondo
to worry about himself.

26:22.749 --> 26:24.516
And tell him to worry
about the team.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.871
No more scratchers.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.406
Hey, 15 stores.
I'm out of cash.

26:47.473 --> 26:49.508
CHRIS: You got to play
till you win, right?

26:49.575 --> 26:51.243
Yeah. Or until
you go bankrupt.

26:57.383 --> 26:59.686
Come on, come on, come on.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.588
Come on. Damn it.

27:02.655 --> 27:03.890
Everything all right?

27:05.224 --> 27:07.193
Yeah. Can't get an even pace.

27:07.259 --> 27:08.828
Uh, slow on the bottom,
fast on the top.

27:08.895 --> 27:10.797
And that's a problem why?

27:10.863 --> 27:15.034
They don't roll even,
they don't cook even.
It's not calculus.

27:15.101 --> 27:17.436
Like you don't
take pride in your work?
What do you need?

27:18.938 --> 27:20.172
Arty, is it?

27:20.239 --> 27:21.674
Yep.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.676
We're hoping you've seen
a customer in here

27:23.743 --> 27:25.845
who resembles the man
in this sketch.

27:25.912 --> 27:27.046
No way.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.148
I knew that dude looked shady.

27:29.215 --> 27:30.449
Why do you say that?

27:30.516 --> 27:32.919
Because no one who eats like
that is in their right mind.

27:32.985 --> 27:35.154
Guy buys, like,
the nastiest food we got.

27:35.221 --> 27:37.556
Almost takes pleasure in it.
Do you know his name?

27:37.623 --> 27:39.225
Nah. Doesn't talk much,
always pays in cash.

27:39.291 --> 27:40.559
Why

27:40.626 --> 27:42.795
We're gonna need to see
your security footage.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.466
That's him.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.535
His hair was different,
and he had a beard then,

27:49.601 --> 27:52.538
but I'd know his eyes
anywhere. 100%.

27:52.604 --> 27:53.773
Thanks, Miss Sims.

27:53.840 --> 27:56.242
Hey, I'll catch up with you
in a minute. Okay.

27:58.644 --> 28:00.847
Our software matched the image
from the security cam

28:00.913 --> 28:02.448
to the DMV records

28:02.514 --> 28:04.851
of an electrical engineer,
Martin Harwell.

28:04.917 --> 28:06.853
He's been in Portland
for the last two years,

28:06.919 --> 28:08.620
but he just moved back
and bought a place in...

28:08.687 --> 28:10.022
You guessed it...
Agoura Hills.

28:10.089 --> 28:11.590
City planner's pulling up
blueprints of the house,

28:11.657 --> 28:12.792
so we know what
we're up against.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.560
The last time, he had
his place booby-trapped.

28:14.626 --> 28:15.762
We should expect
more of the same.

28:15.828 --> 28:17.429
You guys made fast work
out of finding this guy.

28:17.496 --> 28:19.465
You get tired
of being shot at,
my unit's always looking.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.067
We're more about "go get 'em"
than "whodunit,"

28:21.133 --> 28:22.401
so how about we go get him?

28:22.468 --> 28:23.836
I'm rushing the warrant.
Won't be long.

28:24.670 --> 28:25.905
Long before what?

28:25.972 --> 28:27.974
I'll bring you up to speed.
Luca, go get geared up.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.575
Have the rest of the team
meet us on site.

28:29.641 --> 28:30.642
You got it, man.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.944
Street.

28:34.113 --> 28:36.382
Hey. Did you find Buck?

28:37.016 --> 28:38.217
Yeah.

28:39.585 --> 28:42.955
That money he lost,
he wanted it to be a gift

28:43.022 --> 28:44.690
for the kid that he shot.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.759
He's trying to make
things right, I guess.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.228
That guilt's gonna
eat him up alive.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.597
But I think I know something
that could help. It's just...

28:51.663 --> 28:52.832
It's delicate.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.434
Is there anything
I can do?

28:55.501 --> 28:57.804
Yeah. Get Buck in here
at the end of the shift,
all right?

28:57.870 --> 29:00.306
All right. Done.
Okay.

29:28.167 --> 29:30.102
No one came forward?
Nope.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.838
I really thought
someone would.

29:31.904 --> 29:33.672
Might have an idea
why they didn't.

29:33.739 --> 29:36.142
We pulled a print
off the envelope.
And?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.910
We should talk about
how to proceed.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.511
It could get messy.

29:48.654 --> 29:51.457
Hey. What's going on here?

29:51.523 --> 29:53.025
We pulled a print
off the envelope

29:53.092 --> 29:55.227
containing a threat
to Captain Cortez.

29:55.294 --> 29:56.762
Your wife's prints
were in the system

29:56.829 --> 29:58.464
from volunteer work
she did with kids,

29:58.530 --> 30:00.933
and she was here
at H.Q. yesterday
to drop something off for you.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.601
Wait, you're not saying...

30:04.636 --> 30:07.539
Oh, Val. Please tell me
you didn't write that letter.

30:07.606 --> 30:09.241
I didn't want
to get you in trouble.

30:09.308 --> 30:10.542
But you weren't going
to say anything,

30:10.609 --> 30:12.078
and I think it's important
that she knows

30:12.144 --> 30:14.246
how the officers really feel.
JESSICA: And you thought

30:14.313 --> 30:16.482
threatening me
was the best way
to communicate that?

30:16.548 --> 30:17.884
Your proposal
makes it easier

30:17.950 --> 30:19.952
to prosecute cops
for doing their job.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.387
You're threatening them.

30:21.453 --> 30:23.255
My proposal says
cops should be held

30:23.322 --> 30:25.858
to the same standard
as the citizens they protect.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.626
Which is totally fair.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.395
It's just, it's not
what we all felt

30:29.461 --> 30:30.796
when we first heard about it.

30:30.863 --> 30:33.565
ROCKER: It kind of felt
like you were

30:33.632 --> 30:35.601
making it harder on cops
instead of criminals.

30:37.303 --> 30:38.604
Anyway,

30:38.670 --> 30:41.507
a group of us got together,
and we hit the bar

30:41.573 --> 30:43.609
and got pretty riled up
about it.

30:43.675 --> 30:46.045
Riled up enough
to vandalize the captain's
vehicle last week?

30:46.112 --> 30:48.247
I don't know anything
about that.

30:48.314 --> 30:51.918
But I was still upset
when I got home.

30:51.984 --> 30:53.953
Said a lot of things to Val
that I probably
shouldn't have.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.522
All of them true.
Val. Please.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.958
I was never gonna
follow through
on anything in that letter.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.360
I was just trying
to make a point.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.761
MUMFORD:
So, Captain,

31:02.828 --> 31:04.363
how do you
want to handle this?

31:10.369 --> 31:13.005
Watching someone you love head
into danger every single day

31:13.072 --> 31:14.606
must be incredibly difficult.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.308
And you think I'm
increasing that danger,

31:16.375 --> 31:18.610
so I understand why
you wrote the letter.

31:18.677 --> 31:21.480
But everything I do is meant
to keep our officers safe.

31:22.814 --> 31:24.616
And anonymous threats
are not the way to make me

31:24.683 --> 31:26.185
change my mind
on how to do that.

31:28.154 --> 31:30.456
I'm not looking to
do more damage here.

31:30.522 --> 31:33.025
If you promise me
our differences won't be

31:33.092 --> 31:35.627
a problem in the future,
I'm happy to let this go.

31:35.694 --> 31:36.996
They won't.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.699
I promise.

31:40.766 --> 31:42.501
Okay, well, I'm glad
we made peace here,

31:42.568 --> 31:44.636
but this is
a criminal offense,
and crimes have consequences.

31:44.703 --> 31:47.039
We can't just pretend
like this didn't happen.

31:47.106 --> 31:49.942
Well, consequences, sure,
but can't we keep it
in the family?

31:50.009 --> 31:51.043
Well, if we're gonna
enforce the law,

31:51.110 --> 31:52.478
we also have to
follow it, Sergeant.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.387
Sir.

32:05.824 --> 32:06.858
Wake up!

32:09.395 --> 32:11.030
We're just getting started.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.610
May I help you?

32:24.676 --> 32:26.045
Yeah, I'm with
Water and Power.

32:26.112 --> 32:28.214
We've, uh, we've had
some outages in your area.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.815
My power is fine.

32:29.881 --> 32:31.883
Yeah. Just the same,
I'd like to walk
your property

32:31.950 --> 32:32.985
and inspect the lines.

32:33.052 --> 32:35.021
Should only take a minute.

32:35.087 --> 32:36.488
Uh, I'm sorry.
Now's not a good time.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.157
Can you come back tomorrow?

32:38.224 --> 32:40.192
Uh, suit yourself,
but, uh, w-we're gonna
have to cut power

32:40.259 --> 32:41.693
while we run some tests
on the system.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.095
Should only take
a couple minutes.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.268
Fine. But could you
make it quick, please?
Thank you.

32:49.335 --> 32:51.470
Okay, thank you.
And I'm gonna leave
a comment card here

32:51.537 --> 32:52.804
by the gate, so you can
let my boss know

32:52.871 --> 32:54.173
that you're satisfied
with my service.

32:57.009 --> 32:58.177
We got two minutes to get in

32:58.244 --> 32:59.878
before the power restores
and we trigger the alarm.

32:59.945 --> 33:02.981
Cut the power
in three, two, go.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.420
Shall we continue?

33:34.746 --> 33:35.981
HONDO: If this guy
sticks to his M.O.,

33:36.048 --> 33:37.683
we got two live
hostages inside.

33:37.749 --> 33:39.418
And one of them is running
out of time quick.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.553
Remember, this guy's
deep into security tech.

33:41.620 --> 33:43.622
He's probably got some
surprises waiting for us.

33:43.689 --> 33:45.224
Might have more C4 on him.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.059
If you see something,
you alert the team
and we pull back.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.529
We're in.

35:25.557 --> 35:26.992
Well, I guess
he knows we're here.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.460
Any sign of explosives?
DEACON: Negative.

35:28.527 --> 35:31.597
No, but we got
a Burglar Bomb shooting
tear gas from the wall.

35:31.663 --> 35:33.399
Luca, pass me the Hooligan.

35:37.503 --> 35:39.438
All right, we got
a reinforced door.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.440
Preparing an explosive breach
right now.
CHRIS: Roger.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.509
We got a door to work, too,
but I think we can pop it.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.213
(BEEP, HIGH-PITCHED
ELECTRICAL WHINE)

35:51.917 --> 35:53.719
LANCE:
Down here! Help!

35:58.690 --> 35:59.725
Left side clear.

35:59.791 --> 36:00.926
Right side clear.

36:00.992 --> 36:02.594
Where is he?

36:02.661 --> 36:04.363
He's-he's behind there.

36:13.339 --> 36:14.373
Tan, stay ready.

36:14.440 --> 36:15.441
Loosen them up.

36:17.075 --> 36:19.378
I got you. I got you.
You're gonna be okay.

36:20.846 --> 36:22.448
All right, stay calm.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.615
You're good.
You're good.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.183
I got you. I got you.
Come on. Come on.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.719
Easy. All right.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.459
Found the C4.

36:33.525 --> 36:34.860
HONDO:
Copy that. Pull back.

36:34.926 --> 36:36.695
Victims are secure.
Let's get out of here.

36:38.129 --> 36:39.631
I'm not letting this guy
walk again.

36:39.698 --> 36:40.766
HONDO:
Luca, I repeat.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.000
Pull back! That's an order!

36:44.570 --> 36:45.704
Luca!

37:12.063 --> 37:13.932
No!

37:13.999 --> 37:16.535
Why'd you do it?

37:16.602 --> 37:18.937
Why

37:19.004 --> 37:20.005
HONDO: Luca.

37:21.873 --> 37:25.344
Luca! Come on, man.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.220
Target is secure.

37:49.501 --> 37:51.670
Hey. I was just
coming to find you.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.305
I zonked out on Wendy's couch
for a while.

37:53.372 --> 37:54.740
Are you okay?
Yeah.

37:55.507 --> 37:56.542
Did you get him?

37:56.608 --> 37:58.477
We got him,
for good this time.

37:58.544 --> 38:00.612
And the guy he took?
He's safe and sound.

38:04.550 --> 38:06.151
Along with another
victim that we found

38:06.217 --> 38:08.119
in that sicko's basement.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.321
They're-they're both
pretty shook up,

38:09.388 --> 38:11.890
but physically
they're gonna be okay.

38:11.957 --> 38:13.158
I'd like to meet them.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.326
Let them know
they're not alone.

38:14.393 --> 38:16.395
Yeah, of course. Come on.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.532
You did good, now.

38:20.599 --> 38:22.133
JESSICA: I got Hicks
to drop the charge

38:22.200 --> 38:23.769
from criminal threat
to harassment.

38:23.835 --> 38:25.937
Might hurt your pocketbook,
but no jail time.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.206
Thank you, Captain.
I can't tell you
what that means to me.

38:28.273 --> 38:30.175
As long As you're here,
anything else you'd
like to discuss?

38:30.241 --> 38:32.511
No, ma'am.
Concerns about the proposal?

38:32.578 --> 38:34.713
This whole thing
has opened my eyes.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.482
A lot.

38:36.548 --> 38:37.949
Thank you, Rocker.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.628
HONDO: I heard
about the letter.

38:49.695 --> 38:51.430
I'm glad it didn't
become more serious.

38:51.497 --> 38:52.764
Me, too.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.567
So, I guess I, uh,
I don't need to stop by.

38:57.002 --> 38:58.804
I'll see you tomorrow.

39:02.408 --> 39:04.876
I still need to get you
your stuff.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.413
I can meet you
somewhere in between
our places tomorrow.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.181
That's fine.

39:13.184 --> 39:14.252
Good night.

39:18.690 --> 39:21.059
Ah, there he is.
My future Bruin.

39:21.126 --> 39:23.662
Ah, UCLA, baby.

39:23.729 --> 39:25.363
You did
the damn thing, man.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.466
Congrats.
I'm so proud of you.

39:27.533 --> 39:29.267
Thanks. I'm pretty excited.

39:29.334 --> 39:30.936
Well, you should be.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.270
You want a water?
Yeah.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.338
All right.

39:34.172 --> 39:35.841
So, listen, kid.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.375
I had you come down here...

39:39.144 --> 39:40.846
'cause I want to
ask you something.

39:42.614 --> 39:44.315
It's really important.

39:44.382 --> 39:45.484
All right.

39:46.618 --> 39:49.020
The officer
who shot you, Buck,

39:49.988 --> 39:52.257
he was like a mentor
to me coming up.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.659
Raymont, he was
a damn good cop

39:53.725 --> 39:55.694
and he did
a lot of great things
for this city.

39:55.761 --> 39:57.963
Okay. What's that
got to do with me?

39:58.029 --> 40:00.031
He's suffering right now.

40:00.098 --> 40:01.933
He can't seem to let go
of his mistake.

40:02.000 --> 40:04.670
And I'm supposed to
help him out with that
or something?

40:06.738 --> 40:09.608
I was hoping you might
be willing to meet him.

40:09.675 --> 40:11.510
Let him look you in the eye
and tell you he's sorry.

40:11.577 --> 40:12.944
He doesn't need to do that.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.946
I'm moving on.
He should do the same.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.348
I wish it was
that easy, kid.

40:17.415 --> 40:19.818
I understand
that you've done a whole lot
of suffering over this

40:19.885 --> 40:22.187
and I'm so proud of you
for how you bounced back.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.756
I wouldn't
be asking you to do this
if it wasn't important.

40:27.493 --> 40:28.627
I didn't deserve
to get shot.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.462
No, you did not.

40:30.529 --> 40:32.297
And I'm not excusing
his mistake.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.602
But Buck is a thoughtful man.

40:36.668 --> 40:40.071
It's why this whole thing
is eating him alive.

40:40.138 --> 40:41.840
Look, if it makes you too
uncomfortable, I get it.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.141
It's cool.

40:45.844 --> 40:47.312
All I got to do is meet him?

40:47.378 --> 40:48.880
Just hear him out

40:48.947 --> 40:50.115
and see where it
goes from there.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.519
Raymont, the greatest thing
that we can do for someone

40:53.585 --> 40:55.521
who wronged us
is to forgive them.

40:59.457 --> 41:00.992
I don't know if
I'm ready for this.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.393
I mean, I thought
I was, uh,

41:02.460 --> 41:04.229
I was ready for this,
but I don't know.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.465
Hey, how many times
growing up did you tell me,

41:07.533 --> 41:09.467
"Always face your fears"?

41:09.535 --> 41:12.070
Yeah, I didn't think
you were ever listening.

41:12.137 --> 41:13.304
I was.

41:15.106 --> 41:16.474
Now it's your turn.

41:21.279 --> 41:22.881
Got someone here
who wants to meet you.

41:22.948 --> 41:24.282
Now, listen to me,
I don't, I don't want
to do this

41:24.349 --> 41:25.383
if you pressured him into it.

41:25.450 --> 41:26.685
I don't, I don't wanT...
Hondo...

41:26.752 --> 41:28.820
Buck. Buck.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.255
He wants it
and you need it.

41:32.490 --> 41:33.825
Come on.

41:33.892 --> 41:35.193
Okay.

41:37.128 --> 41:38.496
Raymont, come on in.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.733
BUCK: Hey.

41:41.800 --> 41:42.968
I'm Buck Spivey.

41:51.810 --> 41:52.978
Raymont Harris.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.814
Can we, uh, sit down, talk?

42:10.662 --> 42:12.030
You sure that kid's
ready for this?

42:13.464 --> 42:14.666
He's a tough kid.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.936
And Buck has a way of
putting people at ease

42:18.003 --> 42:19.204
and bringing out
the best in them.

42:20.672 --> 42:24.843
Yeah. Yeah, I might know
a thing or two about that.
