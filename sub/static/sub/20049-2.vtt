00:07.590 --> 00:10.411
[theme music playing]

00:30.860 --> 00:31.895
[Hannah]
Welcome back.

00:32.570 --> 00:34.231
So glad you ’re 5177/ listen/77g.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.617
Are you having fun?

00:38.370 --> 00:41.077
You must be wondering who's next,
and why.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.530
Is it you?

00:45.420 --> 00:46.705
What did you do?

00:47.710 --> 00:49.746
How did you end up on these tapes?

00:50.460 --> 00:52.200
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

00:53.010 --> 00:54.671
Maybe you did something cruel.

00:57.470 --> 00:59.597
Or maybe you just watched it happen.

01:06.810 --> 01:09.472
Maybe you o’io’n ’1‘ even realize
you were being cruel.

01:16.030 --> 01:17.941
Maybe you o’io’n ’1‘ do anything at all.

01:24.450 --> 01:26.111
And maybe you should have.

01:30.670 --> 01:31.489
Too late.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.505
I think you know exactly what you did.

01:42.470 --> 01:45.348
And after these tapes,
you 7/ never forget it.

01:46.060 --> 01:47.129
I know] won’t.

01:49.230 --> 01:51.266
Oh, and uh, by the way...

01:52.480 --> 01:53.640
I’m st/l/ dead.

01:55.030 --> 01:57.316
[heartbeat rhythm, fading]

02:11.540 --> 02:12.495
[knock on door]

02:12.590 --> 02:15.206
[Mrs. Jensen] Clay, you're gonna be late.
I made breakfast.

02:17.590 --> 02:19.831
You... you did what?

02:19.930 --> 02:22.387
We're all having breakfast together
this morning.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.555
Oh.

02:25.310 --> 02:27.266
-We are?
-[Mrs. Jensen] Are you awake?

02:27.770 --> 02:30.728
-Are you alive?
-Yeah, I'm alive. Door closed.

02:31.980 --> 02:34.312
I have to be able to see you
to know you're alive.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.607
-It's a minimum requirement.
-You heard my voice.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.237
I heard indistinct mumbles.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.777
Well, you take what you can get
in this life, Mom.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.611
Shower, then breakfast.
Downstairs, please.

02:57.090 --> 03:00.332
[Hannah]
Friendshio. It’s complicated

03:03.970 --> 03:04.959
[shower starting]

03:05.760 --> 03:08.672
But don ’t worry.
You won ’t go through this alone.

03:09.560 --> 03:10.549
Thats not fun.

03:11.270 --> 03:12.259
Trust me.

03:13.060 --> 03:14.220
I’ve been there.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.856
Now, it won ’t always be easy.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.356
It might even hu/t a bit.

03:24.240 --> 03:25.696
Or a bit more than a bit.

03:26.370 --> 03:27.655
That depends on you.

03:28.950 --> 03:31.202
But fear not we 7/ get through this.

03:31.790 --> 03:34.372
Step by step, tape by tape.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.496
You and me. Together.

03:40.380 --> 03:43.588
And don ’t forget... there are others.

04:07.450 --> 04:09.998
[chopping]

04:10.080 --> 04:11.957
[Mrs. Jensen]
Eggs'll be ready in a minute.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.917
Dig into the French toast.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.755
Want cream with that?

04:29.010 --> 04:30.420
[Clay] It's all right.

04:37.440 --> 04:38.646
You don't drink coffee.

04:39.940 --> 04:41.680
I don't eat breakfast either, so...

04:41.780 --> 04:43.350
[Mrs. Jensen]
It has been almost two weeks

04:43.450 --> 04:46.772
since we sat for dinner together
as a family.

04:46.870 --> 04:50.988
I am nothing if not a realist,
so I am proposing

04:51.080 --> 04:53.901
that we have family breakfast
every day instead.

04:54.540 --> 04:57.452
We just each have to get up
a little bit early.

04:57.540 --> 04:59.622
How early did you have to get up?
Yesterday?

04:59.710 --> 05:03.623
We won't do the full spread every day,
but it's nice to start off right.

05:05.470 --> 05:08.792
So, how'd your project end up last night?
With Tony.

05:10.010 --> 05:10.840
Fine.

05:12.220 --> 05:13.471
For history, right?

05:14.060 --> 05:18.303
Yeah, uh, it's, um,
it's this oral history project,

05:31.910 --> 05:34.743
Clay, we know the last few weeks
have been hard.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.706
I stopped taking these two years ago.

05:37.790 --> 05:40.167
Dr. Ellman said you could
have them available if needed.

05:40.250 --> 05:44.584
They're not. And they're probably,
like, expired anyway.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.001
It's a new prescription.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.927
I gotta go.
I need to get ready for school.

05:54.810 --> 05:55.970
Don't forget your lunch!

06:02.440 --> 06:05.068
Might've been a more subtle way
to introduce the idea.

06:05.150 --> 06:06.731
-[door slams]
-He's keeping secrets.

06:06.820 --> 06:10.119
He's 17. I'd be worried about him
if he weren't keeping secrets.

06:11.070 --> 06:12.401
[clears throat]

06:13.950 --> 06:15.781
Secret-keeping is learned behavior.

06:24.130 --> 06:28.794
[Hannah]
See, I can guarantee that one
of the reasons you ’re 5177/ listening

06:28.880 --> 06:30.211
Is that you really want to know...

06:30.970 --> 06:32.346
who are the others?

06:33.560 --> 06:35.596
Who else Is respons/b/e for my death?

06:37.930 --> 06:40.683
Well, you ’re going to learn soon enough.

06:40.770 --> 06:43.568
And of course,
they’re going to learn about you, too.

06:44.770 --> 06:46.067
It they haven ’t already.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.060
What? Feeling paranoid?

06:53.780 --> 06:54.610
0n edge?

06:56.240 --> 06:59.118
Yeah. High school does that to a person.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.882
You never really know who you can trust.

07:12.590 --> 07:13.796
And who you can’t.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.976
-[cheerleaders chant indistinctly]
-[coach] Think fast.

07:23.060 --> 07:26.393
Don't stop moving.
It's hot potato, fellas. Hot potato!

07:26.980 --> 07:28.481
Don't hold that ball too long.

07:28.570 --> 07:30.481
[Hannah]
So keep your wits about you.

07:30.570 --> 07:31.980
It’s all part of the game.

07:32.070 --> 07:35.028
-[coach continues indistinctly]
-But; remember, it’s not a game.

07:35.120 --> 07:35.939
Not at all.

07:36.030 --> 07:38.828
Hey. Skinny kid. Closed practice. Out.

07:39.410 --> 07:40.616
Sorry, Ijust, uh...

07:40.710 --> 07:44.123
Is Justin here? Justin Foley?
We've got this assignment, and--

07:44.210 --> 07:45.416
Who are you?

07:46.250 --> 07:48.627
Clay Jensen.
I'm in your fifth-period history class.

07:48.710 --> 07:50.120
Oh, yeah, quiet kid.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.928
Yeah. So, uh, is he here?

07:53.010 --> 07:53.886
He's not.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.631
And he wasn't here yesterday.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.847
He'd better be here for this
pep rally today.

07:57.930 --> 08:01.309
If you see him, tell him his ass gonna be
running suicides until the lights go out.

08:02.390 --> 08:04.517
I will. IfI see him, I'll tell him.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.765
Sorry to interrupt your practice.

08:09.480 --> 08:10.310
Hey, Jensen.

08:12.150 --> 08:13.777
-Yeah, Coach?
-Tell me something.

08:15.070 --> 08:16.025
Justin...

08:16.740 --> 08:17.729
he in any kind of trouble?

08:19.450 --> 08:20.439
I don't know.

08:20.910 --> 08:21.740
Okay.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.129
Tell him to come and see me.
No matter what, I'm here, okay?

08:32.050 --> 08:32.914
Zach, you're in.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.250
All right, let's run it again!

08:35.260 --> 08:36.750
-Keep up the pace.
-[boy] Go, go!

08:37.350 --> 08:39.807
[Hannah]
Okay. Enough with the small talk.

08:40.060 --> 08:42.722
It’s time to meet the star
of Tape One, Side B.

08:43.770 --> 08:47.854
So, without further ado,
let me introduce my former frieno’.

08:47.940 --> 08:51.023
Step up, Jessica Davis. You ’re next.

08:51.110 --> 08:53.647
Hey. Where the hell is Justin?

08:53.740 --> 08:54.729
I don't know, Jess.

08:54.820 --> 08:55.855
You don't know?

08:55.950 --> 08:58.521
Probably just skipping first, sleeping in.

08:58.620 --> 09:00.235
[Jessica]
Did he ride with you guys today?

09:01.080 --> 09:01.899
[Zach] No.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.649
So, where is he? Marcus?

09:05.250 --> 09:06.490
Did you see him last night?

09:06.580 --> 09:09.208
Yeah, yeah, he was at practice.

09:09.290 --> 09:11.372
Why won't he answer my calls or texts?

09:11.460 --> 09:12.506
I'm sure he'll be there.

09:12.590 --> 09:14.160
-[bel| rings]
-Oh, you're sure. Thanks, Marcus.

09:15.510 --> 09:17.421
Mr. Porter wants to see me now.

09:18.010 --> 09:19.671
He left a call slip in my homeroom.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.968
Miss Davis.
Don't you have a class to get to?

09:25.730 --> 09:27.436
[softly] Tell him I need to talk to him.

09:27.520 --> 09:28.339
Now.

09:31.360 --> 09:32.975
What you listening to, Clay?

09:34.650 --> 09:35.696
Miss Davis.

09:36.320 --> 09:37.230
[scoffs]

09:45.410 --> 09:46.820
Hey, Clay.

09:47.460 --> 09:49.917
-Oh. Hey, Sheri.
-How's everything?

09:51.540 --> 09:53.417
Everything is everything.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.546
I saw you and Coach Patrick this morning.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.006
What a jerk, right?

09:57.090 --> 09:58.170
Well, kind of. I...

09:59.550 --> 10:01.347
You were looking for Justin?

10:01.430 --> 10:02.340
Have you seen him?

10:02.430 --> 10:06.423
No, but Jessica's a bit freaked because
she's his cheer escort to the assembly,

10:06.520 --> 10:08.977
and she missed the morning
run-through looking for him.

10:09.060 --> 10:10.687
This is her first event with the squad,

10:10.770 --> 10:13.898
and her roundoffs are a bit shalq, so...

10:14.280 --> 10:18.068
-Well, that's worrisome. Yeah.
-Right. Why were you looking for him?

10:20.950 --> 10:22.520
No reason. Just homework.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.036
This is me, so...

10:26.000 --> 10:29.822
Clay. Clay, are you sure you're okay?

10:33.590 --> 10:35.160
I'm trying to be.

10:35.260 --> 10:38.673
[sighs] Yeah. You know, I miss her, too.

10:39.090 --> 10:40.000
A lot.

10:41.090 --> 10:43.046
You and Hannah were friends.

10:43.140 --> 10:46.428
Well, you know,
friendship's complicated, but...

10:47.730 --> 10:49.095
we were, yeah.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.518
She ever tell you--
Did she ever say anything about me?

10:55.320 --> 10:56.139
Hm?

10:57.900 --> 11:00.448
Anything... bad?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.366
God, no!

11:02.450 --> 11:04.862
No, Clay, she liked you so much.

11:04.950 --> 11:05.860
[bell rings]

11:05.950 --> 11:07.781
Shoot. German. I can't be late.

11:07.870 --> 11:08.950
Uh...

11:09.040 --> 11:12.419
We should get coffee
or something sometime.

11:12.710 --> 11:13.529
Monet's?

11:14.170 --> 11:15.797
Yeah, sure. Be great.

11:29.180 --> 11:31.899
I met Jessica a couple of weeks
into sophomore year.

11:33.650 --> 11:36.392
Apparent/y, we needed to be counseled

11:40.860 --> 11:42.157
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:43.740 --> 11:45.367
-Mrs. Antilly?
-Yeah.

11:45.450 --> 11:46.269
Me, too.

11:47.620 --> 11:49.360
-Any clue why?
-None.

11:51.290 --> 11:52.996
My new students! [giggles]

11:53.080 --> 11:53.910
Come in!

11:54.500 --> 11:55.330
Come in!

12:00.470 --> 12:02.540
Did you two get a chance to meet outside?

12:04.470 --> 12:07.507
Hannah, meet Jessica.
Jessica, meet Hannah.

12:09.140 --> 12:10.266
You're both new to Liberty,

12:10.350 --> 12:12.807
and I thought it would be good
for you to know each other.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.939
I thought, and I know this isn't
how things are usually done,

12:16.020 --> 12:18.477
but I thought you could be friends.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.561
[Hannah]
Do adults understand how friendships work?

12:20.650 --> 12:25.019
Now, I recognize it's unusual
to assign someone a friend,

12:25.110 --> 12:28.193
so think of it as
a friendly face in a crowd,

12:28.280 --> 12:29.690
until you get your bearings.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.156
So you want us to smile
at each other in the hall?

12:32.250 --> 12:34.571
And how will that help us,
like, directionally?

12:35.380 --> 12:38.417
Well, the point is,
you won't be strangers.

12:38.500 --> 12:41.754
Starting at a new school
can feel overwhelming.

12:42.300 --> 12:44.040
Ijust want you to have an ally.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.540
Two allies.

12:45.640 --> 12:47.096
Count me in as well.

12:47.180 --> 12:50.513
So, just to be clear, we should smile
at you in the hallway too?

12:50.600 --> 12:52.841
Sure! I'd love that!

12:54.640 --> 12:55.470
Listen.

12:56.230 --> 13:00.109
I'm not under any illusion
that this school is a friendly place.

13:00.940 --> 13:02.020
I'd like it to be.

13:03.110 --> 13:05.237
It isn't always, but...

13:05.320 --> 13:08.483
we three, we can be there for each other!

13:08.570 --> 13:09.400
That's all.

13:09.490 --> 13:12.493
Mrs. Antilly, I'm sure Hillary
is awesome, but--

13:12.580 --> 13:15.413
If we're gonna be great friends,
you should know my name is Hannah.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.410
What did I call you?

13:16.500 --> 13:17.319
Hillary.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.626
That's not your name?

13:18.710 --> 13:19.870
No. Hannah.

13:19.960 --> 13:24.294
Crap. I already got your best friend
necklace engraved with "Hillary."

13:24.380 --> 13:26.371
Any students named Hillary
we can set up with Jennifer?

13:26.470 --> 13:28.210
-Jessica.
-Sorry. Jezebel.

13:28.300 --> 13:29.790
No problem, Harriet.

13:29.890 --> 13:33.382
Ooh. Can I actually get a Jezebel?
She'd be an amazing friend.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.897
[laughs] See?

13:38.980 --> 13:42.472
See, the senses of humor on you two.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.561
It's a perfect match!

13:45.150 --> 13:46.481
-Yeah.
-Clearly.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.150
Hey, Helmet.

13:53.620 --> 13:54.496
Hey.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.490
Why are you smiling?

13:56.580 --> 13:57.820
Why shouldn't I smile?

13:58.670 --> 13:59.705
No, I mean, you should.

13:59.790 --> 14:02.873
I was just asking if there was
an immediate recent cause or something?

14:04.210 --> 14:07.839
You literally can manufacture
an existential crisis out of thin air.

14:08.720 --> 14:09.539
It's a gift!

14:10.430 --> 14:13.137
-[chuckles]
-It's a true gift. [voice echoes]

14:14.810 --> 14:16.175
[grunts]

14:18.480 --> 14:19.845
[laughing]

14:27.030 --> 14:29.237
Hey. Is this yours?

14:31.240 --> 14:32.446
Thanks, Mr. Porter.

14:32.530 --> 14:34.191
Haven't seen one of these in a long time.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.780
What you listening to?

14:37.370 --> 14:41.409
Um... My dad had some tapes. Um...

14:42.040 --> 14:44.122
Old music. Ultravox?

14:45.510 --> 14:47.796
Duran... Duran?

14:47.880 --> 14:50.758
[chuckles]
Yeah, sure. Good stuff, man.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.718
I do more jazz myself,
but music is all good.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.209
It gets you through the day.

14:58.020 --> 14:58.839
Here you go.

14:59.940 --> 15:00.895
Um...

15:00.980 --> 15:04.268
Listen, Clay, I would like
to talk to you sometime

15:04.360 --> 15:05.349
about Hannah Baker.

15:07.860 --> 15:08.849
Um...

15:09.650 --> 15:10.730
Hannah? Why?

15:10.820 --> 15:13.027
I'm just trying to understand
what happened.

15:16.490 --> 15:17.616
Yeah. Um...

15:18.500 --> 15:20.070
But, I mean, yeah.

15:20.670 --> 15:24.379
Just come by my office and
we'll just talk sometime, all right?

15:24.460 --> 15:25.700
-Mm-hmm.
-All right.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.218
[Hannah]
Mr. Porter was the replacement
for Mrs. Ant/l/y,

15:30.300 --> 15:32.177
who moved to another school district.

15:32.260 --> 15:34.751
Which, as it turns out
was very unfortunate.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.216
Thats for another tape.

15:37.310 --> 15:38.299
Hey, Joanne.

15:39.100 --> 15:40.510
Hazel. Hey.

15:41.520 --> 15:42.646
Are you following me?

15:42.730 --> 15:44.266
Um, I'm ahead of you.

15:44.860 --> 15:46.259
Fair point.

15:46.360 --> 15:48.772
This is a disaster.
We're walking in the same direction.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.270
Pretty much the end of the world.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.272
Impossibly Perlq Counselor Lady
can't turn out to be right.

15:53.360 --> 15:56.272
How many cats do you think she has?
Five? Seven?

15:56.370 --> 15:57.576
I was thinking 12.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.907
-And they're all, like, obese and purr...
-[Hannah] Really loud.

16:01.710 --> 16:05.669
-Where you going, aanay?
-Home. I live on Bristol. You?

16:05.750 --> 16:07.741
I'm going to Monet's for a hot chocolate.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.165
Hot chocolate. Intriguing.

16:10.510 --> 16:12.000
Especially as the day is warm.

16:12.090 --> 16:14.502
Hot chocolate is the cure
for all things shitty in life.

16:14.590 --> 16:15.420
Huh.

16:16.140 --> 16:17.960
I got shit that needs curing, too.

16:18.930 --> 16:21.512
[Hannah]
Thus began the story of Monet’s,

16:21.600 --> 16:23.056
the story of a friendship.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.185
Yeah, Kat was the best.

16:25.270 --> 16:26.601
When she moved, I just...

16:28.360 --> 16:29.520
Yeah, well, it sucked.

16:30.110 --> 16:32.988
I leave friends behind every two years.
We're always moving.

16:33.070 --> 16:34.606
Parents on the lam?

16:34.700 --> 16:36.486
Dad in the Air Force.

16:36.570 --> 16:38.276
So you're always the new kid.

16:39.370 --> 16:40.997
I had this friend, Amy.

16:41.080 --> 16:44.459
I told her everything, including
my series of embarrassing sex dreams

16:44.540 --> 16:47.589
featuring various Avengers,
including Scarlett Johansson.

16:47.670 --> 16:50.082
Then one day, you know,
the moving trucks come.

16:50.170 --> 16:53.754
I'm like, "Bye! Don't tell anyone
about that Scarlett Johansson thing!"

16:53.840 --> 16:57.628
But she posts about it because that's
the only communication you have anymore.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.927
And it ends up getting around
your new school.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.386
And gets completely twisted.

17:01.470 --> 17:02.767
So you end up That Girl.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.511
I am so That Girl.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.010
I'm That Other Girl.

17:11.440 --> 17:13.522
Stupid Mrs. Antilly.

17:14.110 --> 17:15.657
Bitch is good at her job.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.577
[Hannah]
It was a hot chocolate friendsh/p

17:21.660 --> 17:24.823
good for cold months,
but maybe not perfect for all seasons.

17:24.910 --> 17:27.117
[indistinct chatter]

17:27.210 --> 17:28.825
-What?
-[laughter]

17:33.920 --> 17:35.672
Jessica. Hey, Jessica.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.579
What, Clay?

17:36.680 --> 17:39.171
-Why are you avoiding Mr. Porter?
-I don't know what you're talking about.

17:39.260 --> 17:42.002
You took off when you saw him.
Does he know about the tapes?

17:42.100 --> 17:44.011
Are you crazy? Shut your mouth.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.727
I'm just trying to figure this out.

17:45.810 --> 17:47.437
Then listen, don't talk.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.182
But what happened to Justin?
Why isn't he here?

17:50.940 --> 17:53.773
I don't know.
Mr. Porter pulled him In yesterday,

17:53.860 --> 17:57.739
then he walked out of Porter's office
and out of school and vanished.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.869
Is everything okay with you guys?
You're together, right?

18:02.490 --> 18:04.321
Yes, we're together, and we're ﬁne, okay?

18:04.410 --> 18:05.399
Thank you, Clay.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.206
-I didn't mean to--
-Forget It.

18:08.500 --> 18:12.288
Just... don't believe everything you hear.

18:12.380 --> 18:13.199
Okay?

18:38.070 --> 18:40.812
[Hannah]
For a wh/le, we were the kind
of friends you wish you had

18:43.490 --> 18:45.697
-We did disgusting things l/ke...
-[horn honks]

18:45.790 --> 18:46.779
...shop together.

18:46.870 --> 18:47.700
[both] Sorry!

18:47.790 --> 18:49.997
[Hannah]
And compare what we bought.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.377
That top is perfect for you.

18:53.460 --> 18:56.338
It shows too much of my arms.
They're so fat.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.626
[scoffs] They're not.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.120
I have substitute teacher arms.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.131
[Hannah]
And talk about boys.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.887
Uh-oh. We've got a stalker.

19:04.970 --> 19:06.096
Where?

19:06.770 --> 19:08.840
Play it cool. Three o'clock.

19:09.520 --> 19:10.430
It's after three.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.977
No, three o'clock. Directional.

19:14.860 --> 19:16.725
Oh, my God, your dad is a fighter pilot.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.731
He's a logistics expert, mostly.

19:20.070 --> 19:21.526
Look over there.

19:27.160 --> 19:28.115
He's checking you out.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.748
-He's checking you out.
-No, you, and he's cute.

19:30.830 --> 19:32.457
-He's alone.
-So?

19:32.540 --> 19:35.794
So that means he doesn't have
any friends. That's weird.

19:35.880 --> 19:38.121
We didn't have any friends
two weeks ago.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.761
Um... Hey.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.181
-Hey.
-Hey.

19:51.980 --> 19:53.265
We saw you staring at us

19:53.350 --> 19:55.648
and wondered which one of us
you were checking out.

19:55.730 --> 19:57.311
Oh, I wasn't.

19:57.400 --> 19:58.719
Oh, come on, don't play dumb.

19:58.820 --> 19:59.889
Do we look dumb?

19:59.990 --> 20:02.561
No. I mean, no.

20:03.240 --> 20:05.310
Have you ever heard of the male gaze?

20:05.410 --> 20:07.071
The...? No.

20:07.370 --> 20:08.689
Well, we have.

20:08.790 --> 20:11.953
And we're not totally sure
what it means, but you have it.

20:12.870 --> 20:13.700
[chuckles]

20:13.790 --> 20:16.167
You should at least explain
why you're sitting alone.

20:16.250 --> 20:18.241
My friend thinks that makes you weird.

20:18.710 --> 20:19.950
Are you weird?

20:20.050 --> 20:23.372
Well, I can't objectively answer
the "weird" thing,

20:23.470 --> 20:26.542
but I'm sitting alone
'cause I just moved here.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.630
I don't know anybody.

20:29.970 --> 20:31.016
What's your name?

20:31.100 --> 20:32.089
It's Alex.

20:32.690 --> 20:34.089
Alex Standall.

20:34.190 --> 20:36.055
Okay, Alex Alex Standall...

20:37.190 --> 20:40.899
we are prepared to invite you to our table
if you can answer one question.

20:44.160 --> 20:48.984
What is depicted on the giant painting
they just hung on that wall?

20:52.910 --> 20:57.449
Uh. It's a... giant bleeding man?

20:57.540 --> 20:58.871
Or squid?

20:59.960 --> 21:01.291
Or man-squid.

21:02.880 --> 21:04.461
Uh... In spring.

21:08.050 --> 21:10.132
Good enough. You're in.

21:10.220 --> 21:13.383
Okay. Thanks. Uh, what am I in, exactly?

21:13.480 --> 21:15.436
If you have to ask, you don't know.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.686
-[Hannah]
And just //ke that...
-[indistinct chatter]

21:24.650 --> 21:25.730
...two became three.

21:27.030 --> 21:29.612
-It's for my food blog.
-[laughing]

21:29.870 --> 21:33.692
And //ke, before you know it;
you ’re best friends.

21:33.790 --> 21:34.950
[ma/e teacher]
Mr. Jensen.

21:40.040 --> 21:43.123
Not so fast, young man,
you're wanted at the office.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.006
Why? What for?

21:47.090 --> 21:49.752
Surprisingly, they don't send
a complete explanation.

21:49.850 --> 21:51.306
They send a summons.

21:52.520 --> 21:53.635
Attendance.

21:53.720 --> 21:56.883
So, I guess this has to do
with your attendance.

21:58.940 --> 22:00.180
[phone ringing nearby]

22:00.270 --> 22:01.510
What is it?

22:01.610 --> 22:04.647
Daily report. You're on attendance alert
starting this week.

22:05.650 --> 22:07.140
Attendance alerts?

22:07.700 --> 22:10.316
You need to make sure you are
marked present by all teachers,

22:10.410 --> 22:13.038
and the first two weeks,
they have to note your participation.

22:14.330 --> 22:16.992
But why am I on these?
I have good attendance.

22:17.080 --> 22:19.457
Someone wants to make sure
you keep It that way.

22:20.210 --> 22:21.996
[indistinct chatter]

22:24.300 --> 22:27.042
I'm supposed to present a project
with Justin Foley,

22:27.130 --> 22:29.257
and he wasn't here for homeroom.

22:29.930 --> 22:31.966
Did he have a late admit?

22:32.600 --> 22:35.137
I can't release information
on another student.

22:39.060 --> 22:41.142
-Another doctor's note, Alex?
-Yep, another one.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.299
It's the same doctor.

22:42.400 --> 22:43.355
Okay.

22:43.980 --> 22:45.186
Hey, man.

22:45.280 --> 22:46.099
Hey, Clay.

22:47.820 --> 22:48.980
[stammers] How are you doing?

22:49.570 --> 22:50.776
How am I doing?

22:51.200 --> 22:52.656
How are you doing?

22:54.660 --> 22:55.479
Yeah.

23:00.670 --> 23:02.661
[groans]

23:02.750 --> 23:03.739
Females!

23:03.840 --> 23:04.829
Male!

23:04.920 --> 23:07.332
I have concluded that this school sucks!

23:07.420 --> 23:08.751
Except for you guys.

23:08.840 --> 23:10.831
We fully support your conclusions.

23:10.930 --> 23:13.296
Let's discuss this in our office
this afternoon.

23:13.390 --> 23:14.709
Wait, our office?

23:15.010 --> 23:16.170
My God. Monet's.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.010
Oh, right. I love it.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.681
[Hannah]
There was nothing
two hot chocolates

23:21.770 --> 23:24.512
and Alex’s coffee drink dujour
cou/dn ’t fix.

23:27.900 --> 23:29.106
F.M.L.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.479
Why? What happened?

23:31.110 --> 23:32.486
I got put in remedial math

23:32.570 --> 23:36.688
because my math from my old school
is not the same math they have here.

23:36.790 --> 23:38.826
Who knew that there was different math?

23:38.910 --> 23:41.413
But I bet there's a hot troubled bad boy
in remedial math.

23:41.500 --> 23:44.708
He broods, he wears leather,
he's got a past he doesn't talk about

23:44.790 --> 23:46.667
and trouble with long division.

23:47.300 --> 23:49.416
There are a couple of pregnant girls.

23:49.510 --> 23:51.000
Will your parents freak?

23:51.680 --> 23:52.829
My dad would freak.

23:52.930 --> 23:55.637
Yeah, my mom might, but my dad's a cop,

23:55.720 --> 23:58.928
so as long as I stand up straight
and pass P.E.,

23:59.020 --> 24:00.260
go shooting with him--

24:00.350 --> 24:03.513
Wait, your dad's a cop?
And you go shooting with him? With guns?

24:03.900 --> 24:05.390
How did I not know about this?

24:06.480 --> 24:08.277
You never asked, I guess.

24:08.360 --> 24:11.648
I love a man in uniform.
I would like to meet your father.

24:11.740 --> 24:12.980
Ew.

24:13.070 --> 24:15.231
And your dad wears a uniform.

24:16.950 --> 24:20.078
Oh, yeah. I never thought about that.

24:21.120 --> 24:22.405
[Hannah]
You need friends.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.126
Even just hot chocolate friends.

24:25.210 --> 24:26.279
[cell phone chimes]

24:26.380 --> 24:28.496
EspeCIa/ly when your life goes to shit.

24:32.260 --> 24:35.081
Day after day, drink after drink,

24:35.180 --> 24:37.887
we lifted our mugs
and we lifted each other.

24:39.390 --> 24:40.209
F.M.L.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.516
-F.M.L.
-F.M.L.

24:42.600 --> 24:43.976
Ew. Cappuccino fingers.

24:44.060 --> 24:45.140
Sorry, sorry.

24:45.690 --> 24:48.511
-Fuck Justin.
-You don't even have to talk about it.

24:49.110 --> 24:49.929
[Jessica] Ever.

24:52.700 --> 24:53.598
Okay.

24:54.410 --> 24:55.274
Okay.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.407
Did you guys take that Vocational
Interests and Aptitude Test?

24:59.490 --> 25:01.742
We got our results back today,

25:01.830 --> 25:04.321
and I'm suited to be...

25:04.420 --> 25:06.160
[Hannah]
In spite of our differences,

25:06.250 --> 25:08.582
we were what we each needed
at that moment in time.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.836
Three drinks against the world.

25:12.670 --> 25:16.049
Two hot chocolates, and whatever
the hell Alex was dn'nking.

25:19.140 --> 25:22.177
What the hell is that?

25:22.930 --> 25:24.807
I'm working my way through the menu.

25:25.230 --> 25:26.686
I'm committed to this.

25:26.770 --> 25:28.260
God, you're weird.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.225
[Alex] No, I'm a searcher.

25:30.320 --> 25:33.938
The fact that you just called yourself
a searcher is weird.

25:36.990 --> 25:39.026
Something's up with you today.

25:42.700 --> 25:44.952
My dad's being deployed again.

25:45.910 --> 25:49.914
-Oh, man. I'm so sorry, Jess.
-Wow, that sucks.

25:50.000 --> 25:53.663
He'll be in the Middle East somewhere,
and he can't tell us where,

25:53.760 --> 25:57.423
probably because it's some country
we're not supposed to be at war with.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.545
F.M.L. forever.

26:02.140 --> 26:03.095
F.M.L. forever.

26:03.180 --> 26:04.590
[Alex] F.M.L. forever.

26:07.310 --> 26:10.359
[Hannah]
I ’rn not great at math,
but here is one thing I learned for sure:

26:10.440 --> 26:14.854
one plus one plus one...
Is not a simple equation.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.231
Alex was the first to stop coming.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.037
He found some other friends. He traded up.

26:24.120 --> 26:26.031
[indistinct chatter]

26:27.040 --> 26:29.918
We were 5177/ friendly in the halls,
but that’s it.

26:32.880 --> 26:34.586
Then it was down to Jessica and me.

26:36.220 --> 26:38.677
But then, Jessica stopped coming, too.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.216
We all went our separate ways.

26:43.850 --> 26:44.805
Or so I thought.

26:47.350 --> 26:49.648
[inaudible]

27:20.880 --> 27:22.962
-[Mrs. Bradley] I'm surprised, you know?
-[Mr. Porter] Yeah.

27:23.050 --> 27:26.508
The other day, I'm handing out
the family dynamics papers,

27:26.600 --> 27:27.760
and I see hers.

27:28.310 --> 27:29.129
[Mr. Porter] Mmm.

27:30.140 --> 27:32.438
I swear to God, I just about lost it.

27:33.020 --> 27:33.850
Yeah.

27:34.610 --> 27:36.726
I imagine. It's still fresh.

27:36.820 --> 27:39.948
[Mrs. Bradley] I know.
I mean, I've been losing sleep.

27:40.030 --> 27:43.773
I had Hannah in my class
two years in a row.

27:43.870 --> 27:46.020
How many students
do you have, Pam? Hm?

27:46.120 --> 27:48.111
-[Mrs. Bradley] That's not the point.
-Over 200.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.031
I have 600 on the advisory list.

27:50.120 --> 27:50.950
That's not--

28:06.180 --> 28:07.386
[sighs]

28:08.720 --> 28:10.347
That shit'll kill you, you know.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.603
You got a salad from McDonald's,
the people who make the Big Mac.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.470
Are you fat-shaming my salad?

28:18.650 --> 28:20.277
You called my lunch a murderer.

28:21.240 --> 28:22.355
[chuckles]

28:22.450 --> 28:24.190
-Thank you.
-Anytime.

28:27.120 --> 28:31.033
Can I ask you a super-needy, when-did-
I-become-this-kind-of—girl question?

28:33.080 --> 28:35.571
Oh, my God. Unfreeze.
It's not about my period.

28:36.340 --> 28:37.159
Okay.

28:39.300 --> 28:42.007
Do you think I could ever be
as pretty as Jessica Davis?

28:46.260 --> 28:47.921
Great. Thanks. Got it.

28:48.010 --> 28:50.012
[stammers] No, I-I just...

28:52.100 --> 28:56.514
I mean, yeah, Jessica's pretty and all,
but you're special.

28:57.150 --> 28:58.936
Special. Like retarded.

28:59.020 --> 29:00.430
Did I say retarded?

29:00.530 --> 29:01.736
I didn't say retarded,

29:01.820 --> 29:04.732
and I don't think we're
supposed to use that word anymore.

29:04.820 --> 29:08.074
Regardless... I saw you try to be kind...

29:08.700 --> 29:10.281
and, you know, fail.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.109
Wait, I didn't--

29:14.460 --> 29:17.827
Wait, how did this conversation
go so wrong, so fast?

29:18.920 --> 29:20.626
It's how you're socialized.

29:21.000 --> 29:23.412
I keep thinking you're
some different kind of male.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.335
Clearly, there's no such thing.

29:32.430 --> 29:33.636
[Hannah] Enjoy your movie.

29:39.520 --> 29:40.350
Hey.

29:40.980 --> 29:41.856
You're here?

29:41.940 --> 29:44.067
No, I'm animatronic.

29:44.650 --> 29:46.140
You don't work Wednesdays.

29:46.240 --> 29:49.653
-I'm covering for Karen.
-Oh, okay. Yeah. That's cool.

29:49.740 --> 29:50.729
I guess.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.321
She's in a junior college play,
A Few Good Men,

29:53.410 --> 29:56.117
which is so not the story of her life.

30:00.960 --> 30:03.201
-Oh, thanks.
-Put it away.

30:03.840 --> 30:06.502
What good is having a best friend
who works at the movies

30:06.590 --> 30:08.421
if you can't get in for free?

30:13.220 --> 30:15.131
-Hey, Hannah.
-Hey, Alex.

30:15.230 --> 30:16.800
Fancy seeing you here.

30:17.690 --> 30:19.009
Hey, you work Wednesdays?

30:19.100 --> 30:21.352
Covered this. Jess can fill you in.

30:21.440 --> 30:24.773
Oh, yeah, we were, um...
we were just hanging out.

30:25.940 --> 30:26.941
Together.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.189
So I see.

30:32.410 --> 30:34.230
Cool. Um...

30:34.330 --> 30:36.195
So, could I get one?

30:39.370 --> 30:40.746
Ten dollars, please.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.205
Oh. Um...

30:47.800 --> 30:48.619
Here you go.

30:49.590 --> 30:50.716
Enjoy your movie.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.843
Please, let us know if we can
make your visit more pleasant.

30:55.680 --> 30:56.510
Okay.

31:02.270 --> 31:04.511
[Hannah]
It was fine, Jess. It was.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.771
You ’re the kind of girl
that boys l/ke to l/ke,

31:07.860 --> 31:09.396
not spread rumors about.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.988
You ’re the nice girl,
the kind that becomes a cheerleader.

31:14.490 --> 31:16.287
[pop music playing]

31:42.150 --> 31:43.469
[song ends]

31:43.560 --> 31:46.267
[cheering]

32:00.000 --> 32:03.879
Hey there, Liberty Tigers,
it's an exciting day at Liberty High.

32:03.960 --> 32:09.125
Our varsity basketball team
is kicking off its pre-season today,

32:09.210 --> 32:14.386
the first step on the road
to returning to the state finals!

32:14.470 --> 32:16.677
[cheering]

32:23.100 --> 32:25.807
By Liberty tradition,
I'm happy to welcome to the podium

32:25.900 --> 32:29.609
the winner of this year's Captain's Award

32:29.690 --> 32:32.568
to introduce the varsity squad.

32:32.650 --> 32:33.981
[boy] Walker!

32:36.700 --> 32:40.784
Now, this season's winner
is co-captain of the football team

32:40.870 --> 32:43.247
and the baseball team,

32:43.330 --> 32:47.664
and was called "an inspiration
to his entire team, friend to all...

32:48.380 --> 32:50.951
-a tough mother-bleep...
-[laughter]

32:51.050 --> 32:52.915
...and a true born leader,"

32:53.010 --> 32:57.879
and I am delighted to bestow
the Liberty High Captain's Award

32:57.970 --> 32:59.801
on Bryce Walker.

32:59.890 --> 33:01.300
[cheering]

33:19.080 --> 33:20.945
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

33:21.830 --> 33:23.570
Ah, it's an honor,

33:23.660 --> 33:26.037
and I'm proud to be
a Liberty student athlete.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.200
Go Tigers!

33:27.290 --> 33:29.121
[cheering]

33:38.260 --> 33:42.014
Now, this year's starting lineup...

33:44.310 --> 33:47.052
[drumroll on bleachers]

33:47.150 --> 33:49.357
Willem Barclay!

33:49.440 --> 33:51.977
-[cheering]
-[pop music plays]

33:59.870 --> 34:01.485
Zach Dempsey!

34:10.750 --> 34:12.741
Justin Foley!

34:18.930 --> 34:20.170
[cheering fades]

34:31.230 --> 34:32.936
Anders Anderson!

34:33.020 --> 34:34.180
[cheering]

34:41.660 --> 34:43.821
J. B. Garrison!

34:47.830 --> 34:49.821
[music and cheering continue in distance]

34:55.260 --> 34:58.297
How could you do this to me?
Call me back, or at least text me.

34:59.680 --> 35:00.578
Jessica?

35:01.340 --> 35:02.796
What, Clay? What do you want?

35:02.890 --> 35:04.846
-We need to talk.
-No, we don't.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.512
We have to tell someone about Justin.
Like, Mr. Porter.

35:07.600 --> 35:10.228
Mr. Porter? Really?
That's a fantastic idea.

35:10.310 --> 35:11.720
Does he know about the tapes?

35:11.810 --> 35:14.688
I will say it one more time.
Keep your mouth shut, got it?

35:15.360 --> 35:18.102
-Jess--
-Back off, Clay! Leave me alone.

35:18.860 --> 35:19.690
[door opens]

35:19.780 --> 35:21.486
[chatter]

35:24.620 --> 35:27.908
[Hannah]
When Jessica has something
on her mind; she lets you know.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.706
-What?
-We need to talk.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.877
[Hannah]
And I knew
what she wanted to talk about.

35:38.880 --> 35:39.915
Alexis list.

35:47.020 --> 35:47.964
[Marcus] Hey, Clay.

35:48.890 --> 35:50.380
What's up, man?

35:51.310 --> 35:52.516
Hey, Marcus.

35:52.600 --> 35:54.477
-Need a ride?
-Where you going?

35:55.270 --> 35:57.602
-I'm good. I got my bike.
-Just throw it in the trunk.

35:57.690 --> 36:00.352
We're gonna go hang at Bryce's.
You should totally come.

36:02.320 --> 36:03.776
[engine rewing]

36:07.120 --> 36:09.406
Hey, Clay. You all right?

36:10.540 --> 36:11.666
Yeah, thanks.

36:11.750 --> 36:12.569
You sure?

36:15.540 --> 36:16.370
Yeah.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.330
You heard him, boys.

36:19.920 --> 36:20.875
He's all right.

36:27.850 --> 36:29.090
[tires screech]

36:44.360 --> 36:46.692
[Hannah]
You see, that’s just how
it works in high school.

36:47.700 --> 36:49.827
Boys talk, girls listen...

36:51.290 --> 36:53.076
and everything gets messed up.

36:54.040 --> 36:56.122
Or at least
that’s how it was with us.

36:56.210 --> 36:57.336
R/ght Jess?

37:11.180 --> 37:12.670
F.M.L.?

37:13.980 --> 37:15.140
I should have known.

37:15.600 --> 37:17.101
I know the rumors, Hannah.

37:17.190 --> 37:18.726
Well, you can't know rumors.

37:18.980 --> 37:20.641
You can hear them,
but you can't know them.

37:21.400 --> 37:22.640
We were friends.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.026
How could you betray me like that?

37:25.110 --> 37:26.566
Like what? What did I do?

37:26.660 --> 37:28.150
Is it you and Alex now?

37:28.240 --> 37:29.867
No! How could you even--

37:29.950 --> 37:30.826
Of course not!

37:30.910 --> 37:33.322
He likes you, you like him.
I'm the one who's out.

37:33.410 --> 37:35.287
Yeah, and that pissed you off, didn't it?

37:35.960 --> 37:36.995
A little. I mean...

37:37.580 --> 37:38.831
It made me sad.

37:39.670 --> 37:41.046
Why didn't you just tell me?

37:42.130 --> 37:44.337
Maybe I was afraid of something like this.

37:44.420 --> 37:45.830
Something like what?

37:54.060 --> 37:55.971
[Hannah]
You needed it to be my fault. . .

37:56.770 --> 37:58.010
so it was my fault.

37:59.650 --> 38:01.606
Jess. You know this doesn't mean anything.

38:01.690 --> 38:03.601
-Don't act innocent.
-But I am.

38:03.690 --> 38:05.317
I had nothing to do with this.

38:05.740 --> 38:06.855
Alex did this on his own.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.906
He just broke up with me on his own.

38:10.700 --> 38:12.076
I didn't know he broke up with you.

38:14.450 --> 38:16.862
I'll just say this: enjoy it.

38:16.960 --> 38:18.245
'Cause you will, won't you?

38:18.330 --> 38:20.161
'Cause that's what sluts do.

38:20.790 --> 38:21.791
Fuck you.

38:22.460 --> 38:23.506
[Hannah gasps]

38:38.730 --> 38:39.845
[Hannah]
Friendsh/p.

38:41.020 --> 38:42.226
It’s complicated.

38:47.650 --> 38:48.730
[Clay] Is it working?

38:50.660 --> 38:51.649
The hot chocolate?

38:55.290 --> 38:56.109
No.

39:07.720 --> 39:10.086
Why did you and Hannah fight?
I don't get it.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.296
Of course you don't. You're a guy.

39:12.390 --> 39:13.596
You guys were friends.

39:13.680 --> 39:14.886
We weren't friends.

39:14.970 --> 39:17.848
Friends tell the truth,
friends don't turn on each other.

39:17.930 --> 39:19.557
Hannah's a user and a liar.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.268
You can't believe anything that she says.
Not a thing.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.272
I mean, what she said, on the tapes,

39:25.360 --> 39:26.725
about us and Monet's,

39:26.820 --> 39:28.981
she's the one who stopped coming,
not me.

39:29.400 --> 39:31.948
She's the one who ended
our friendship, and she knew it.

39:32.320 --> 39:33.309
She's a liar.

39:34.910 --> 39:35.899
Was a liar.

39:38.200 --> 39:39.827
Why would she lie?

39:39.910 --> 39:41.116
Why do you think?

39:41.460 --> 39:42.449
I don't know.

39:43.130 --> 39:44.666
I don't understand any of this.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.377
I mean, I know people talk.

39:46.460 --> 39:48.872
Relationships start. They end.

39:49.300 --> 39:52.178
I guess I always thought, "How much does
high school stuff really matter?"

39:52.260 --> 39:54.216
But... I mean, it does.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.177
But, you know, it... [sighs]

39:56.560 --> 39:58.516
We're only here for four years.

39:59.270 --> 40:00.385
If you live that long.

40:05.060 --> 40:06.266
Can I ask you something?

40:06.650 --> 40:11.235
Zach and Marcus really wanted
to give me a ride just now at school.

40:12.360 --> 40:13.315
So?

40:13.950 --> 40:16.157
So... that's never happened before.

40:17.160 --> 40:18.821
They even invited me to hang at Bryce's.

40:18.910 --> 40:19.786
At Bryce's?

40:20.370 --> 40:21.496
Oh, my God.

40:21.580 --> 40:22.706
Of course they did.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.162
Any idea how I acquired these new friends?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.791
They're not your friends.

40:41.390 --> 40:43.642
I Bryce]
Official word Is he ’s not here.

40:43.730 --> 40:46.392
Yeah, well, Coach is looking
for him now, too.

40:46.480 --> 40:48.562
He's fucking pissed
that he missed the assembly.

40:49.820 --> 40:51.230
He's in the pool house.

40:53.990 --> 40:55.981
Stoned off his gourd, by the way.

40:56.070 --> 40:57.276
He's been here all day?

40:57.370 --> 40:58.576
Yeah, since last night.

40:59.040 --> 41:00.155
What'd he do?

41:01.370 --> 41:02.576
Who the fuck knows?

41:14.550 --> 41:17.098
[video game sound effects]

41:20.810 --> 41:21.629
Yo, man.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.146
Hey, Jessica's looking for you.

41:34.240 --> 41:35.355
She looks bad.

41:35.450 --> 41:37.156
Yeah, she has for a while.

41:38.030 --> 41:39.770
You gonna talk to her?

41:39.870 --> 41:40.859
And say what?

41:40.950 --> 41:42.656
Tell her to get her shit together.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.150

42:29.170 --> 42:31.877
You listened to the tapes. You had to.

42:31.960 --> 42:32.949
Who else has?

42:33.920 --> 42:35.547
I'm not here to tell you that.

42:36.550 --> 42:38.006
Then why are you here?

42:38.090 --> 42:39.637
Clay, you're the slowest yet.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.056
What is taking you so long?

42:44.600 --> 42:45.555
It's hard.

42:46.730 --> 42:47.970
To listen.

42:48.060 --> 42:49.266
Of course it is.

42:49.730 --> 42:52.016
It's tapes from a dead girl.

42:53.900 --> 42:56.232
Doesn't this affect you at all?

42:57.740 --> 42:59.355
More than I can tell you.

42:59.450 --> 43:00.940
Why can't you tell me?

43:04.910 --> 43:06.446
You remember seventh grade?

43:06.870 --> 43:10.249

in the toilet and that shit?

43:10.960 --> 43:11.779
Yes.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.292
And I told you that me
and my brothers could fix it,

43:14.380 --> 43:15.870
and you said,

43:15.960 --> 43:19.964
"Sometimes, a guy's gotta
get through things on his own."

43:20.050 --> 43:20.880

-What did I tell who?

44:18.320 --> 44:20.561
Mr. Porter!
What did you tell him yesterday?

44:20.650 --> 44:22.151
Why haven't you been at school?

44:22.240 --> 44:24.117
I just needed a day off to chill.

44:24.200 --> 44:26.942
They day after you talk to Porter,
you need a day off?

44:27.030 --> 44:28.657
You're not telling me something!

Clay has the tapes now.

44:41.590 --> 44:43.296
I know. Don't worry about it.

44:43.380 --> 44:45.848
He's not like the rest of us.
He could say something.

44:45.930 --> 44:48.057
He won't talk. We'll make sure of it.

44:50.430 --> 44:52.341

If anything, it's a compliment.

A compliment? I don't think so.

47:18.910 --> 47:22.209
Well, you remember what we saw
on her Facebook, the texts?

47:22.290 --> 47:23.917
She had some unkind classmates.

47:24.000 --> 47:26.207
She was bullied. This is bullying!

You've done so much for us already,

inside one of the books
in Hannah's locker, and we...

that maybe you could tell us.
