10:29.193 --> 10:32.849
Sloane. Please sit down.

10:32.893 --> 10:35.286
I don't think you've met
Lieutenant Gormley.

10:35.373 --> 10:38.159
Nice to meet you.Good morning.

10:41.205 --> 10:44.774
So... what about the attack
last night?

10:44.818 --> 10:47.821
Yes, uh, we didn't finish
catching up yesterday.

10:47.864 --> 10:51.389
I'm in New York
as VP North America

10:51.476 --> 10:53.653
for Aegis & Associates.

10:53.740 --> 10:54.958
Cybersecurity.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.657
Mm-hmm. The best.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.484
[sighs]

10:59.571 --> 11:02.313
We like ours.As well you should.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.533
It appears they've
done a great job

11:04.664 --> 11:06.709
in limiting the damage.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.538
Thank you.
But do you know
for certain

11:09.625 --> 11:12.497
that your people
contained the intrusion,

11:12.584 --> 11:15.022
or that the attackers had
already timed their retreat?

11:15.109 --> 11:17.372
To what end?

11:19.548 --> 11:21.419
We're seeing an uptick
in attacks

11:21.506 --> 11:24.335
that seem full-on,
but are really just a way

11:24.422 --> 11:26.207
of testing the targeted systems

11:26.294 --> 11:27.338
by stressing them.

11:27.425 --> 11:31.516
And that $10 million ransom...

11:31.603 --> 11:33.257
Which we didn't have to pay.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.216
That's what you call
lunch money.

11:35.259 --> 11:37.871
You see, I would seriously
consider that your enemies

11:37.958 --> 11:39.873
are playing a longer game here.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.788
They already know
your system's strengths,

11:41.831 --> 11:44.442
which usually reveal
the weaknesses as well.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.880
Nothing's perfect.

11:49.317 --> 11:50.840
Cops don't like coincidence.

11:50.884 --> 11:53.016
As a former cop, I know
you understand that.

11:53.103 --> 11:55.062
I do.

11:55.105 --> 11:57.238
Us being attacked last night,
and you suddenly showing up

11:57.325 --> 12:00.197
pitching solutions, well,

12:00.284 --> 12:02.896
it causes one to wonder.

12:02.983 --> 12:05.333
[scoffs]
If they're somehow connected?

12:05.420 --> 12:07.596
I have to ask, Sloane.

12:07.683 --> 12:09.816
I neither had nor have
any knowledge

12:09.859 --> 12:12.514
of the attack last night,
but I do have eons

12:12.601 --> 12:14.690
of experience in this area.

12:14.734 --> 12:18.215
And I have come today
as a friend of the court.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.742
And this friend would do what?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.744
Ask for the autopsy.
See if I can help.

12:26.528 --> 12:29.096
With a contract for your firm?

12:29.183 --> 12:31.838
If it's appropriate.

12:31.925 --> 12:35.145
If not, then gratis.

12:37.757 --> 12:41.717
Thank you so much for your time,
Commissioner Reagan.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.764
Let me know if I can be
of assistance.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.767
Good morning, everyone.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.772
[door closes]

12:54.730 --> 12:56.601
I don't remember her
quite so...

12:56.732 --> 12:57.864
Ballsy?

12:57.951 --> 12:59.387
Intense?

13:07.830 --> 13:10.093
And that's when you let
a known felon

13:10.180 --> 13:13.009
with an active felony warrant
walk free?

13:13.053 --> 13:16.839
He wasn't known to us.
NYPD's system was down.

13:16.883 --> 13:19.102
Maybe you heard it on the radio
on your way here?

13:19.146 --> 13:20.974
If sarcasm's all you got,
no wonder you let him get away.

13:21.061 --> 13:23.324
Detective, we had no choice.

13:23.411 --> 13:24.978
Just like Powers'
six victims.

13:25.065 --> 13:26.806
Six victims?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.764
One confirmed felony assault,

13:28.808 --> 13:31.332
but I suspect him on five more.
All middle-age women.

13:31.419 --> 13:32.812
All the same act.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.422
Six?

13:34.509 --> 13:37.904
Let me guess, it
involves their dogs.

13:37.947 --> 13:40.428
Powers sob-stories them about
his own puppy who ran away.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.082
When they drop
their defenses,

13:42.125 --> 13:44.519
he talks his way into their
homes and assaults them,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.260
stealing everything they have.

13:46.347 --> 13:47.435
Assaults them sexually?

13:47.522 --> 13:49.611
Just physically and mentally.

13:49.698 --> 13:51.831
Our vic was lucky she saw us.

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223
Till you let him waltz.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.703
Not for nothing,
Detective,

13:54.790 --> 13:55.965
but I don't see him locked up

13:56.009 --> 13:57.662
in one of your state pens
either.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.708
Difference is, I lost him
when he skipped bail.

13:59.795 --> 14:02.624
You lost him on failure
of policing 101.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.278
Thank you for the lesson
in policing 101,

14:04.365 --> 14:06.106
and now here's one in return.

14:06.149 --> 14:09.196
You have no jurisdiction here
and no police power.

14:09.283 --> 14:10.545
So we'll be the ones
to end this guy's

14:10.632 --> 14:12.547
reign of terror, thank you.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.419
Let's hope so.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.428
[door opens, closes]

14:25.734 --> 14:29.129
So, say someone you know...Like a cop?

14:29.216 --> 14:31.131
No, just a friend.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.916
But they're doing
something kind of dodgy,

14:33.960 --> 14:36.266
and if their boss finds out,
they would get jammed up.

14:36.353 --> 14:38.486
Jammed up how?
Can't say.

14:38.616 --> 14:39.922
Why not?

14:39.966 --> 14:41.097
Actually, I've already said
too much.

14:41.184 --> 14:43.404
You barely started.Nope. Done.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.058
You go.

14:45.145 --> 14:47.799
Okay. [sighs]

14:47.887 --> 14:49.236
So let's say someone
you know really well...

14:49.323 --> 14:51.368
Like a friend?No, like a cop.

14:51.412 --> 14:54.328
And you discover that they
pose a danger to themselves.

14:54.415 --> 14:56.286
What kind of danger?I can't say.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.680
Why not?
'Cause I promised.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.335
And this cop was
a really great cop

15:01.422 --> 15:02.597
for a long time.

15:02.727 --> 15:04.381
Was or is?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.296
You know what,
now I've said too much.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.299
Good talk, husband.

15:09.386 --> 15:11.475
As always, wife.

15:15.305 --> 15:16.959
What do we got?

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
Detectives, this is the guy.You called the tip-line?

15:19.048 --> 15:21.616
Right after I rode up
with Iris on the elevator.

15:21.703 --> 15:25.315
Usually, I can't get her
to stop talking, but this time

15:25.402 --> 15:27.970
she was clammed up,
and with some guy.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.712
Can you give us a description
more than just "some guy"?

15:30.799 --> 15:34.020
Average height, squirrely.
Real intense.

15:34.063 --> 15:36.152
Okay. You know where
we can find them?

15:36.239 --> 15:37.588
She's in apartment 3B.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.939
Thanks.
Wait down here.

15:40.026 --> 15:41.114
Yes, ma'am.

15:45.422 --> 15:46.858
[knocking][dog barking]

15:46.946 --> 15:49.818
Iris? Police. Open up.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.342
[loud crash inside]

15:56.956 --> 15:59.088
[dog barking]Police!

15:59.175 --> 16:00.394
Check the bedroom.

16:06.008 --> 16:07.444
He's in the wind.

16:07.575 --> 16:08.663
[sobbing]

16:12.797 --> 16:15.583
It's okay. Police, ma'am.[sobbing hysterically]

16:15.670 --> 16:18.064
It's okay. Call a bus.

16:18.107 --> 16:21.284
It's okay, ma'am,
it's okay. Baez!

16:21.371 --> 16:22.807
Call a bus.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.383
It's hard to remember.

16:33.470 --> 16:34.689
I-I was so scared.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.214
Did he say his name?

16:38.301 --> 16:39.824
Bill something.
Bill Smith.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.348
Bill Smith.

16:41.435 --> 16:42.784
And he asked about your dog?

16:42.914 --> 16:44.873
Yeah. He said he lost his.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.223
He kept saying "the chip."
The dog had a chip.

16:47.267 --> 16:51.227
But his phone was dead,
so we should use my computer.

16:51.314 --> 16:55.318
And I said no,
but he insisted.

16:55.405 --> 16:57.364
I'm such an idiot.

16:57.451 --> 16:59.670
DANNY:
It's not your fault, ma'am.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.846
Excuse me.

17:03.979 --> 17:05.763
It's gonna be okay.
All right?

17:05.850 --> 17:07.678
You take care of her.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.814
Hey.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.903
You all right?

17:14.990 --> 17:19.125
Just a bit dizzy.
I didn't eat today.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.735
That's funny, 'cause
I'm pretty sure I saw you

17:20.822 --> 17:22.737
scarf down an entire hero
all by yourself

17:22.867 --> 17:24.217
about an hour ago.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.785
You ever get that thing
where you're a rookie

17:27.916 --> 17:29.265
all over again,

17:29.352 --> 17:31.441
and suddenly a case is
following you home?

17:31.528 --> 17:34.053
Yeah. It's called being
a human being.

17:35.271 --> 17:37.099
You ever get tired of it?

17:37.186 --> 17:38.405
Being a human being?

17:38.492 --> 17:41.930
No, this, all of this.
Day in, day out.

17:42.017 --> 17:45.977
Years of seeing brutalized
victims like Iris in there.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.503
Yeah. All the time.

17:49.590 --> 17:51.113
Comes with the job.
You know that.

17:51.157 --> 17:53.550
And now we have people
putting us on trial

17:53.637 --> 17:55.900
with their cell phones
at every turn.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.251
Unfortunately, that comes
with the job now, too.

17:58.338 --> 18:00.470
We deal with it.[exhales sharply]

18:00.557 --> 18:05.301
Every cop has a mid-life...

18:05.388 --> 18:09.000
mid-career crisis of some sort.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.611
All of us. Me, too.

18:10.698 --> 18:13.831
Except I don't have
a husband to divorce,

18:13.918 --> 18:16.138
or a car to trade in
for a Corvette.

18:16.225 --> 18:17.879
All I've got is this job.

18:18.880 --> 18:20.621
You got me.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.798
[sighs]

18:23.885 --> 18:25.843
Maybe you're better off
handling this one on your own.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.280
Okay?

18:36.332 --> 18:37.594
Knock-knock.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.074
Hey.

18:39.161 --> 18:40.293
Hi.
Have a seat.

18:40.380 --> 18:43.861
Um, I need some legal advice.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.776
So you finally came
to your senses.

18:45.863 --> 18:47.952
You're gonna love
my divorce lawyer.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.476
Me and Jamie are fine.

18:49.563 --> 18:53.001
It's about a friend of mine
who is pregnant.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.525
A friend?It's a fellow cop.

18:55.612 --> 18:58.528
She screwed up; she didn't
notify the department.

18:58.615 --> 19:01.009
It sounds more like
employment law

19:01.096 --> 19:03.925
or union issues, neither
of which are up my alley.

19:04.055 --> 19:05.100
How do you do it, Erin?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.885
Do what?
Everything.

19:07.972 --> 19:11.933
You have an amazing career,
you raised a beautiful daughter.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.327
You have basically been
kicking ass in a man's world,

19:14.370 --> 19:17.199
and you did it all by yourself.But I haven't.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.767
Come on.All the "by myself" stuff,

19:19.854 --> 19:22.944
I grew up with my mom,
I've had Anthony,

19:23.074 --> 19:24.989
I co-parented with Jack.

19:25.076 --> 19:29.385
And I've had the rest of you
as my... Greek chorus,

19:29.429 --> 19:32.214
singing songs that I didn't
always want to hear,

19:32.301 --> 19:35.086
but sometimes neededto hear.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.827
You have a tribe.

19:36.958 --> 19:39.090
I have a tribe.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.049
This woman has no one.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.790
She has you.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.705
When she's not avoiding me.Okay, so don't let her.

19:44.792 --> 19:46.533
Track her down.
Remind her that

19:46.620 --> 19:49.275
we sisters have got to
stick together.

19:49.362 --> 19:51.538
Can two women even make a tribe?

19:51.625 --> 19:53.627
Yeah. When one of them
is Eddie Janko,

19:53.714 --> 19:56.717
that's worth at least
a dozen men.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.675
[takes deep breath]

20:01.504 --> 20:03.680
[sighs]

20:03.767 --> 20:06.292
And the price for this
system upgrade?

20:06.379 --> 20:08.424
Next page.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.296
Their rough stab at it,
calculated

20:10.339 --> 20:13.168
from similar overhauls Aegis &
Associates have implemented

20:13.255 --> 20:15.605
in European cities.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.825
Nice work if you can get it.

20:17.912 --> 20:19.218
Makes paying the ransom
look like the bargain.

20:19.305 --> 20:21.655
And Ms. Thompson herself?

20:22.917 --> 20:24.353
Professional opinion?

20:26.007 --> 20:27.356
Both.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.228
Very impressive.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.620
But?

20:33.275 --> 20:35.799
Perhaps not above
trying to make this deal

20:35.886 --> 20:39.934
by leveraging a prior
personal relationship.

20:45.940 --> 20:48.377
After your detail changed
your morning pickup

20:48.421 --> 20:52.076
from Bay Ridge
to Manhattan those times...

20:52.163 --> 20:54.209
I did put
two and two together.

20:58.909 --> 21:02.565
Well, Abigail,

21:02.652 --> 21:06.352
those times were
a long time ago.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.398
Long but not forgotten?

21:11.531 --> 21:13.924
No, see, that's the thing.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.579
I guess I had forgotten
because when she told me

21:16.666 --> 21:18.277
she'd been back here
for a while,

21:18.364 --> 21:21.323
and obviously hadn't called,

21:21.410 --> 21:24.021
well, it's not like it landed

21:24.152 --> 21:26.981
as anything on me, so...

21:28.939 --> 21:30.898
Why?

21:30.985 --> 21:32.856
You're asking me?

21:32.987 --> 21:35.381
Apparently.

21:35.424 --> 21:37.513
This is always a trap.
You tell me.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.825
Or don't. Up to you.

21:44.912 --> 21:48.742
Okay, uh, maybe one day,

21:48.829 --> 21:52.006
when I was really busy
with other stuff,

21:52.093 --> 21:56.227
that part of me that
would have been open to,

21:56.315 --> 21:59.492
I don't know,
that kind of relationship,

21:59.579 --> 22:04.453
maybe it just locked
from the inside.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.107
What, like a car?

22:06.194 --> 22:07.238
You're being pretty literal.

22:07.326 --> 22:08.805
And you're being pretty...

22:11.112 --> 22:13.636
Okay, beg to differ.

22:13.723 --> 22:14.942
No, thanks.

22:15.072 --> 22:16.073
That's an order.

22:16.204 --> 22:17.814
[sighs sharply]

22:17.901 --> 22:20.121
You didn't just ask her
probing questions yesterday,

22:20.208 --> 22:21.731
you peppered her with them--

22:21.818 --> 22:23.298
sinkers, sliders, spitballs--

22:23.385 --> 22:25.300
looking for a personal reaction.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.261
Oh.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.353
You asked.

22:39.532 --> 22:41.272
Find out why she left
London Police

22:41.360 --> 22:42.926
without my fingerprints on it.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.712
Yes, sir.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.500
[Jamie grunting]

22:51.587 --> 22:53.937
Is there someone here?

22:54.024 --> 22:56.157
Oh, hey, Pop.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.466
This chimney hasn't
been cleaned

23:00.509 --> 23:02.990
since I could fit
all the way up inside it

23:03.077 --> 23:04.557
hiding from Danny and Joe.

23:04.600 --> 23:07.037
And you decided to
try this again why?

23:07.124 --> 23:09.388
It's just overdue maintenance.

23:09.431 --> 23:12.782
I-I nailed down that
loose board on the staircase,

23:12.826 --> 23:14.175
and I got fire extinguishers
for under the sink

23:14.305 --> 23:16.046
and the upstairs closet.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.048
And I ordered a pie
from Grimaldi's,

23:18.135 --> 23:20.790
in there on the counter;
pepperoni, light sauce.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.010
And will you be feeding me
before or after you've finished

23:23.097 --> 23:24.751
childproofing the cabinets?

23:24.838 --> 23:26.317
What?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.581
You're coddling me.No, I'm not.

23:28.668 --> 23:30.539
Yeah, you are, so cut it out.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.846
I was just trying
to lend a hand.I've got two right here.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.413
And a bad knee
that would hurt for a week

23:34.456 --> 23:36.153
if you tried to do this
by yourself.

23:36.240 --> 23:38.155
What's the first thing
you do in the morning?

23:38.242 --> 23:40.157
Make my bed and exercise.

23:40.244 --> 23:43.422
And I take stock.
What is my name?

23:43.465 --> 23:45.772
What is my social security
number?

23:45.859 --> 23:48.427
What city do I live in?Pop...

23:48.470 --> 23:52.213
Because I'm afraid that today
might finally be the day

23:52.300 --> 23:54.476
when I don't remember
those things.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.522
You got a long time
before that.

23:56.609 --> 23:59.394
But one day time will win,

23:59.438 --> 24:04.007
and no amount of age-proofing
this house will change that.

24:04.094 --> 24:07.271
So back off and let me be.

24:09.099 --> 24:10.753
You don't even want pizza?

24:10.840 --> 24:13.887
Oh, I'm keeping the pizza,
and I'll enjoy it.

24:13.974 --> 24:15.671
Good night, Jamison.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.859
DANNY: Eddie's onto
something here.

24:29.946 --> 24:32.209
Full moons definitely
change people.

24:32.296 --> 24:33.602
Change like into werewolves?

24:33.689 --> 24:35.952
No, not like fur and fangs.

24:36.039 --> 24:39.521
Like, people get nuttier
when there is a full moon.

24:39.565 --> 24:41.697
And there's one this week,
so everybody look out.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.307
I am with Sean on this.SEAN: Thank you.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.571
People are crazy
because they're crazy.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.051
Not because of the way
the planets are aligned.

24:48.182 --> 24:49.836
There you go.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.054
I seem to remember you
having an astrology phase.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.665
I did not!

24:52.708 --> 24:54.231
Well, don't listen to him.
He's a Libra.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.625
DANNY: Well, personally,
I think astrology's crap,

24:56.669 --> 24:58.322
but as someone who's done
their share of midnights,

24:58.409 --> 25:00.455
full moons can definitely
make things

25:00.499 --> 25:03.023
get a little hairy
out there on the street.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.590
Hairy?DANNY:Hairy.

25:04.633 --> 25:06.287
Come on, that was
a good joke. Come on.No.

25:06.374 --> 25:08.071
DANNY:
Hairy. Full moon.

25:08.158 --> 25:10.465
Werewolves.Must've missed it.

25:10.509 --> 25:12.206
How else do you explain
my partner's behavior lately?

25:12.293 --> 25:13.947
She's completely shut me out.

25:14.034 --> 25:15.514
Full moon.ERIN:
There's a lot of that

25:15.557 --> 25:17.907
going around.Yeah. Don't remind me.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.256
Wait, you're
spilling secrets to her?

25:19.343 --> 25:20.257
What are you talking about?

25:20.344 --> 25:21.650
I hate to tell you, Danny.

25:21.694 --> 25:23.173
That whole full moon thing
is a myth.

25:23.260 --> 25:25.175
I don't know, Dad.And how do you know?

25:25.262 --> 25:27.047
Well, when I first started
working the streets,

25:27.134 --> 25:29.223
I saw all that craziness,
so I asked Pop.

25:29.310 --> 25:30.877
He set me straight. Right, Pop?

25:30.964 --> 25:32.182
Hmm.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.271
Was that a yes?

25:34.402 --> 25:35.446
I guess.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.665
You okay down there,
Gramps?

25:36.752 --> 25:37.710
Yeah, he's fine.

25:37.797 --> 25:38.885
I can speak for myself,

25:38.972 --> 25:40.103
thank you very much.

25:40.190 --> 25:41.322
ERIN:
Okay, let's put

25:41.452 --> 25:42.671
the fangs away, boys.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.238
Fangs.ERIN:
We, uh,

25:44.325 --> 25:46.066
talk through our problems
here at the table.

25:46.109 --> 25:49.025
Except for those people who keep
trying to fix someone else's

25:49.112 --> 25:50.505
without their permission.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.202
Whatever, Pop.

25:52.289 --> 25:53.421
Yeah, "whatever" yourself.

25:53.552 --> 25:54.857
ERIN:
Nothing you two

25:54.944 --> 25:56.250
want to talk about?

25:56.380 --> 25:57.643
Not a thing.

25:57.730 --> 25:58.948
All good.

26:00.210 --> 26:03.953
Maybe that whole full moon thing
isn't a myth after all.

26:04.040 --> 26:04.998
Mm-hmm.JANKO:
Just saying.

26:05.128 --> 26:07.087
Just...

26:07.174 --> 26:09.176
May I have the butter, please?ERIN:
Yeah.

26:17.619 --> 26:19.447
Okay, Jamie, enough.

26:19.578 --> 26:21.754
Enough what?Enough of you

26:21.841 --> 26:23.190
not telling what's going on

26:23.277 --> 26:25.322
even though it's obviously
about you and Henry.

26:25.409 --> 26:27.368
Fine. I'm worried about him.

26:27.455 --> 26:29.413
In what way?In the way

26:29.500 --> 26:31.067
that he almost burned
down the house last week.

26:31.154 --> 26:32.939
What?!Then demanded I clam up.

26:33.026 --> 26:34.941
What, even to me?

26:35.028 --> 26:36.377
It was a blanket threat.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.248
You still
should've told me.

26:38.335 --> 26:40.337
I mean, everyone gets older

26:40.424 --> 26:43.079
sooner or later.
Other people have to step in.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.081
And I did. Hard. Maybe too hard.

26:46.517 --> 26:48.302
Pop's always been
a hero of mine,

26:48.345 --> 26:50.304
and I just want to pay that
back in spades, but now I feel

26:50.391 --> 26:51.871
like I've hurt his feelings

26:51.914 --> 26:53.742
and I can't even broach
the subject again

26:53.829 --> 26:55.396
without hurting him more.

26:55.483 --> 26:58.573
Oh, is he too stubborn
to accept an apology?

26:58.617 --> 27:00.096
Have you met
my grandfather?[chuckles softly]

27:00.183 --> 27:03.230
[inhales]
Well,

27:03.317 --> 27:06.189
maybe instead of making it

27:06.276 --> 27:08.844
about how scared
you are for him,

27:08.888 --> 27:12.108
you make it
about how much you need him.

27:12.195 --> 27:14.458
Meaning?Sometimes the best way

27:14.545 --> 27:16.591
to apologize
is to ask for a favor.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.334
Okay.

27:20.421 --> 27:22.031
So, now your secret.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.686
No.

27:24.730 --> 27:28.298
After I just spilled mine?
And you obviously told Erin.

27:28.429 --> 27:29.909
Just give me a chance

27:29.996 --> 27:32.563
to take my own advice.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.261
[exhales]

27:43.444 --> 27:46.099
Not a single Gavin Powers

27:46.186 --> 27:48.275
in the entire
tristate. Hmm.

27:48.318 --> 27:51.495
Guess I'll just have to sort
through all these Bill Smiths.

27:51.582 --> 27:53.236
I know what you're doing,
Reagan.

27:54.977 --> 27:56.675
Be fun to help, won't it?

27:56.762 --> 27:58.851
Didn't say that.Well,

27:58.894 --> 28:00.809
then I guess
I'll just have to be on my way.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.465
Got to start knocking
on all these doors.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.075
[scoffs]
What are you, an idiot?

28:06.162 --> 28:08.295
Powers was smart to use

28:08.382 --> 28:10.253
a common name as an alias,
which means you got

28:10.297 --> 28:12.429
about a hundred names
on that list.No, actually.

28:12.560 --> 28:14.301
Only 87.

28:14.388 --> 28:17.478
Which will take you
about a month to track down.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.306
You want a fighting chance,
whittle your list

28:19.393 --> 28:21.917
down to all the Bill Smiths
living in the area

28:22.004 --> 28:23.527
of the last few assaults.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.747
Perps like that
usually like to work an area.

28:25.791 --> 28:28.358
You know, I could've sworn
you were off this case.

28:28.445 --> 28:31.013
I could've sworn
you were a good detective.

28:31.100 --> 28:32.319
I am.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.625
Though I'm better with you.

28:34.713 --> 28:36.062
[sighs]

28:40.675 --> 28:42.155
[sighs]

28:44.331 --> 28:46.637
[sighs]

28:48.814 --> 28:50.467
[sighs]

28:50.598 --> 28:52.295
[door opens]

28:53.557 --> 28:55.385
Speak of the devil.

28:57.648 --> 28:59.259
Behave yourself.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.046
Sloane. Please.

29:05.831 --> 29:08.355
Is this the one that opens
onto the piranha tank?

29:08.442 --> 29:09.704
No, it's that one.

29:09.791 --> 29:10.749
[chuckles]

29:14.927 --> 29:16.624
Look, I'm sorry, uh,

29:16.711 --> 29:18.669
for being so tough on you
the other day.

29:18.757 --> 29:19.845
Oh, not at all.

29:19.932 --> 29:21.455
Yes, at all.

29:21.585 --> 29:22.891
A stressful time.

29:22.978 --> 29:24.980
Yeah, well, I remember.

29:25.067 --> 29:26.329
And cyberattacks
are right up there

29:26.416 --> 29:28.157
on the scale, so...

29:31.900 --> 29:35.121
"The NYPD welcomes the alliance
with Aegis & Associates

29:35.208 --> 29:36.905
"to assess and upgrade

29:36.949 --> 29:39.255
"the security
of its computer capabilities

29:39.386 --> 29:40.866
citywide."

29:40.953 --> 29:42.606
Check the spelling and grammar,

29:42.693 --> 29:45.044
and we'll release it
to the press.

29:46.045 --> 29:47.873
I'm chuffed.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.439
I take it that means "happy."

29:49.570 --> 29:50.614
Very.

29:50.701 --> 29:52.355
Then we both are.But

29:52.442 --> 29:53.879
in the fine print?

29:57.099 --> 29:59.101
[sighs]
We can only pay you

29:59.188 --> 30:01.756
a third of what you ask for.

30:02.713 --> 30:03.976
Really?

30:04.063 --> 30:06.195
Sloane...
[sighs]

30:06.239 --> 30:09.808
I'm not trying to take advantage
of our friendship.

30:09.851 --> 30:12.506
But there are some
harsh realities in my budget.Well,

30:12.593 --> 30:15.161
I'll take it to my board.Hopefully,

30:15.248 --> 30:16.684
with the recommendation

30:16.771 --> 30:18.991
that the discount
will be more than made up

30:19.078 --> 30:22.472
with the coin
of the NYPD's reputation

30:22.559 --> 30:25.649
when you approach Paris,
Tel Aviv,

30:25.780 --> 30:27.826
Geneva, et cetera.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.613
You are always one step ahead.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.528
I try to be.

30:37.748 --> 30:39.663
Sloane,

30:39.750 --> 30:43.015
tell me about Gerald Foster.

30:45.278 --> 30:48.237
Clearly, you already know.

30:48.281 --> 30:51.458
Only the official story
of your retirement.

30:51.545 --> 30:54.200
With rumors
of sexual harassment,

30:54.287 --> 30:56.158
a seven-figure settlement,

30:56.202 --> 30:59.205
out on Friday with full honors
and a pension

30:59.292 --> 31:02.077
and in your new job on Monday.

31:04.079 --> 31:06.865
That's mostly the facts.

31:06.908 --> 31:11.217
To say anything more would be
to violate a very robust NDA.

31:11.304 --> 31:13.610
Which would've hurt
for you to sign.

31:13.741 --> 31:15.308
In this day and age?

31:15.395 --> 31:17.484
For a cop like you?
For a woman like you?

31:17.614 --> 31:18.920
Yeah.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.662
Honestly?

31:21.749 --> 31:23.969
What hurts just about the same

31:24.012 --> 31:25.492
is the fact
that I've been reduced

31:25.579 --> 31:27.668
to the subject
of your investigation.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.627
Well, I didn't mean
to offend you.

31:30.758 --> 31:31.977
Well, you have.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.804
I was concerned, that's all.[scoffs]

31:33.892 --> 31:36.329
About my well-being? Or about
the fact that I didn't ring you?

31:36.459 --> 31:38.200
Here.

31:38.287 --> 31:40.811
This can be shredded.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.422
Have a good day.

31:56.523 --> 31:58.307
Hey, there you are.

31:58.394 --> 31:59.439
And here I go.

31:59.526 --> 32:02.311
Look, I know
you're avoiding me.

32:02.398 --> 32:04.226
So take the hint.Please, I just...
