00:00.066 --> 00:01.800
Virginia:  <i>Previously on</i>
<i>masters of sex...</i>

00:01.802 --> 00:05.270
You made it very
clear that you don't
approve of my behavior.

00:05.272 --> 00:08.173
The fact I have sex
with virginia

00:08.175 --> 00:09.541
With no plans to stop.

00:09.543 --> 00:10.109
What happened?

00:10.111 --> 00:12.444
My mother will go back
to ohio for good.

00:12.446 --> 00:13.812
Jane:  <i>And lester's job</i>
<i>as a production assistant</i>

00:13.814 --> 00:17.549
Is for a real studio,
which means he's gonna be
a director soon

00:17.551 --> 00:18.951
And he wants me to be
the leading lady.

00:18.953 --> 00:21.020
I have been putting up
with al because of you.

00:21.022 --> 00:22.988
And I don't want to see
them ever again.

00:22.990 --> 00:24.990
Betty doesn't
like helen.

00:24.992 --> 00:27.026
I mean, those two,
they're so close.

00:27.028 --> 00:29.128
The way they kiss
each other right
on the lips

00:29.130 --> 00:30.729
And now they hate
each other?
I don't...

00:30.731 --> 00:31.964
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What are you
talking about?

00:31.966 --> 00:34.700
It's just you and me,
hand-in-hand,
despite everything.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.468
Everything... Oh,
and it has been everything.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.470
Every lie imaginable, betty.

00:38.472 --> 00:39.405
What's going to happen
to me?

00:39.407 --> 00:42.074
The radiation
may slow the cancer,

00:42.076 --> 00:43.776
But it's unlikely
to stop it.

00:43.778 --> 00:46.111
Virginia: (crying)
<i>and she's my friend.</i>

00:46.113 --> 00:48.047
She knows me.

00:49.149 --> 00:50.983
I know you.

00:52.819 --> 00:54.820
I'm sorry.
I must have, uh...

00:54.822 --> 00:56.055
You're looking
for virginia?

00:56.057 --> 00:58.323
Who are you?
Her... Her beau.

01:19.712 --> 01:20.479
Can I help you?

01:20.481 --> 01:24.683
I'm sorry.
I must have the
wrong address.

01:24.685 --> 01:26.518
Masters and johnson
clinic?

01:26.520 --> 01:27.519
Oh, no.
I'm, I'm not a patient.

01:27.521 --> 01:31.857
Uh, I'm just, it's my first
day back at my old job.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.426
Just getting here early
to get a jump on things.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.028
The neighborhood's down
on its luck.

01:36.030 --> 01:38.764
Hard to keep
good tenants.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.165
Communist headquarters?

01:40.167 --> 01:41.900
Used to be a haberdashery,

01:41.902 --> 01:43.135
Then a dentist office...

01:43.137 --> 01:45.204
Better red than dead.

01:46.005 --> 01:48.273
That was a joke.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.776
(elevator dings)

01:52.278 --> 01:53.779
Whole space up here
belongs to

01:53.781 --> 01:55.914
Masters and johnson now.

01:55.916 --> 01:57.349
Used to be eddie's
place before

01:57.351 --> 02:00.519
Dr. Masters
fancied it all up.

02:03.756 --> 02:07.025
You have a happy
first day now.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.794
Thank you.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.598
<i>Some men come home to fame</i>
<i>and fortune,</i>

02:12.600 --> 02:16.235
<i>Some to measure ejaculate.</i>

02:22.208 --> 02:25.377
<i>Can you, uh, back up</i>
<i>onto your mark?</i>

02:25.379 --> 02:26.178
My mark?

02:26.180 --> 02:28.347
Lester: Uh, the feet.

02:28.615 --> 02:30.449
Your feet go on
the feet.

02:30.451 --> 02:33.552
The feet are
your mark.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.092
It's as if you
never left.

02:40.094 --> 02:42.161
I was thinking
the same thing.

02:42.163 --> 02:43.162
I meant to tell you,

02:43.164 --> 02:46.431
I received a postcard
from jane last week.

02:46.433 --> 02:51.036
Really? Didn't know
they had postcards
in bitch town.

02:52.705 --> 02:55.207
I'm good to go
when you are.

02:55.209 --> 02:59.778
All right.
I will tell dr. Masters
we're ready.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.690
<i>October 15, 1958.</i>

03:11.692 --> 03:16.461
<i>Subject 38-328...</i>
<i>Ejaculate trajectory.</i>

03:25.838 --> 03:27.306
(sighs)

03:27.308 --> 03:29.308
(camera whirs)

03:34.981 --> 03:38.350
(sighs) we're running
out of space.

03:38.751 --> 03:40.018
We need another

03:40.020 --> 03:42.354
At least dozen
bulletin boards,

03:42.356 --> 03:44.256
Considering
we're at the halfway point.

03:44.258 --> 03:44.890
You'll order them?

03:44.892 --> 03:46.358
I would say
we're more than halfway.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.460
I disagree.
I won't publish
until we have

03:48.462 --> 03:52.764
At least 100 observations
of each individual
phenomena,

03:52.766 --> 03:56.168
10,000 observed sex acts
in total

03:56.170 --> 04:00.072
To ensure that the data
is ironclad, unimpeachable,

04:00.074 --> 04:03.408
Which means
we're now at the
halfway point at best.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.844
Well, I'd say
even halfway

04:05.846 --> 04:08.046
Is ambitious
at this point.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.048
I was doing the books
last night...

04:10.050 --> 04:11.016
And the sky is falling.

04:11.018 --> 04:15.554
It's safe to say that
we are not in the
best shape financially.

04:15.556 --> 04:17.122
Money will sort
itself out.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.091
How? By magic?

04:19.093 --> 04:21.793
23 of your fertility cases
followed us here

04:21.795 --> 04:24.930
Out of the hundreds
that you had at maternity.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.267
Oh, uh,
am I interrupting?

04:28.269 --> 04:30.035
What you are
is a half-hour late.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.536
Hardly an
auspicious beginning.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.872
Does auspicious mean
hello to you, too?

04:33.874 --> 04:36.541
Betty, uh,
what are you...

04:36.543 --> 04:40.312
(scoffs)
I'm the new girl.

04:40.446 --> 04:40.812
Girl?

04:40.814 --> 04:44.383
Yes. Miss dimello...
Mrs. Moretti.

04:44.385 --> 04:45.017
Miss dimello.

04:45.019 --> 04:46.285
Dr. Masters:
Has joined our staff

04:46.287 --> 04:49.721
To help with light
paperwork and
answering phones.

04:49.723 --> 04:53.525
You hired betty
without telling me,

04:53.527 --> 04:54.226
Without consulting me?

04:54.228 --> 04:58.096
I didn't consult you
about the move here
or the terms of our lease.

04:58.098 --> 05:00.666
Which was a mistake,
I think we can both agree.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.600
Betty can also help
with the books.

05:01.602 --> 05:05.270
I do the books.
Yes, but it's not your
area of expertise, is it?

05:05.272 --> 05:08.040
Betty did the finances
at the brothel.

05:08.042 --> 05:09.074
Betty: Mmm, I ran
the books there,

05:09.076 --> 05:11.977
And we had steak
three nights a week
and heat in the winter.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.211
You said we were
short-handed.

05:13.213 --> 05:14.613
Here's your extra
set of hands.

05:14.615 --> 05:16.248
Please see to it
that betty gets settled

05:16.250 --> 05:19.184
And has everything
she needs.

05:19.585 --> 05:23.889
Man: (over tv)
<i>violence against negroes</i>
<i>in little rock, arkansas,</i>

05:23.891 --> 05:24.823
<i>Is once again on the rise</i>

05:24.825 --> 05:27.893
<i>As white citizens</i>
<i>are blaming the</i>
<i>negro community</i>

05:27.895 --> 05:31.730
<i>For the closing of</i>

05:31.732 --> 05:32.998
<i>Tensions increased</i>

05:33.000 --> 05:36.101
<i>After controversial arkansan</i>
<i>orval faubus...</i>

05:36.103 --> 05:39.037
Change your thoughts,
and you change
your world.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.206
Easier said than done,
apparently.

05:41.208 --> 05:42.441
Elliot: We haven't had
the pleasure

05:42.443 --> 05:45.210
Of your and mrs. Holden's
company for a while.

05:45.212 --> 05:46.945
It's nice to see you back.

05:46.947 --> 05:49.681
Well, there's reasons
for our...

05:52.151 --> 05:53.952
...Absence.

05:55.722 --> 05:59.491
Mrs. Holden is...

05:59.625 --> 06:00.926
Uh...

06:01.894 --> 06:03.595
(chuckles)

06:03.930 --> 06:07.366
Well, mrs. Holden
decided that,

06:07.368 --> 06:12.104
Uh, the life
we created together

06:12.939 --> 06:15.207
Was no longer enough.

06:16.242 --> 06:18.710
So she has left

06:19.178 --> 06:22.414
In search
of greener pastures.

06:23.082 --> 06:26.084
I'm, I'm so sorry,
dr. Holden.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.986
You always seemed like
the nicest couple.

06:27.988 --> 06:31.423
Well, things aren't
always what they seem,

06:31.657 --> 06:33.725
Elliot, are they?

06:33.727 --> 06:37.729
No. No, sir.
Heavens, I just...No.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.468
Someone who works
right here
at this hotel...

06:43.470 --> 06:44.369
He will remain
nameless...

06:44.371 --> 06:49.241
But his wife
just ran off
with a spaniard.

06:49.809 --> 06:51.610
(clicks tongue)

06:51.612 --> 06:54.813
You just don't
see it coming.

06:55.982 --> 06:57.549
That's the worst part.

06:57.551 --> 07:01.052
You take a vow.
You take a wife.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.656
And with that wife,

07:06.692 --> 07:09.261
You enter into

07:10.196 --> 07:12.164
A covenant

07:12.698 --> 07:14.332
Where you can...

07:14.334 --> 07:15.801
You can stand exposed,

07:15.803 --> 07:19.838
And you can show things
you've never shown anyone,

07:19.906 --> 07:22.340
Because your wife...

07:23.709 --> 07:25.710
She knows you.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.948
She sees you,

07:31.584 --> 07:35.720
And, uh,
she's not repulsed.

07:36.689 --> 07:40.492
She doesn't recoil.
She doesn't leave.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.464
And the betrayal

07:45.466 --> 07:48.667
Of that kind of wife
who just comes in

07:48.669 --> 07:51.436
And opens you up,
and then...

07:51.438 --> 07:54.072
Nah, just, just leaves.

07:56.042 --> 08:00.512
That is a wife
who cannot...

08:01.280 --> 08:04.015
Cannot be forgiven.

08:14.861 --> 08:18.230
For every storm,
a peaceful harbor.

08:18.232 --> 08:21.333
For every tear,
the buds of may.

08:21.335 --> 08:24.002
For every care,
a perfect future.

08:24.004 --> 08:28.006
My wish for you
on this special day.

08:28.008 --> 08:28.940
(gasps)

08:28.942 --> 08:30.609
Oh, daddy's here.

08:30.611 --> 08:34.112
Just us three
for johnny's birthday.

08:38.384 --> 08:40.886
(swing music plays)

08:41.621 --> 08:44.389
You've landed yourself
a handsome beau.

08:44.391 --> 08:46.758
Looks like me a little.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.760
Is it serious
with this guy?

08:48.762 --> 08:51.429
He hasn't asked me
to go steady

08:51.431 --> 08:52.797
If that's what you mean.

08:52.799 --> 08:54.099
And, uh,

08:54.101 --> 08:56.001
How's our bill
taking this?

08:56.869 --> 08:57.235
Bill?

08:57.237 --> 09:00.372
He has nothing to do
with my personal life.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.308
I see.
Playing that game.

09:04.510 --> 09:06.111
Bill is married, austin.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.979
We work together.
That's all.

09:07.981 --> 09:09.748
I'll take your
overreaction to mean

09:09.750 --> 09:11.550
You've ended things
with bill.

09:11.552 --> 09:12.250
Good move.
Austin.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.152
Out with the old,
in with the new.

09:14.154 --> 09:18.323
Looks like we both
have a second chance
at happiness.

09:18.325 --> 09:20.725
Me with the beautiful,
vivacious holly,

09:20.727 --> 09:22.661
And you with sidney.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.795
Shelley.

09:23.797 --> 09:25.597
(softly) shelley.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.166
Careful with her
mitts, shel.

09:28.168 --> 09:29.467
(chuckles)

09:29.469 --> 09:30.302
If she were a surgeon,

09:30.304 --> 09:31.937
You would fuss
over her hands less.

09:31.939 --> 09:36.174
Hand models
have it 10 times
harder than surgeons.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.044
One nick, scratch,
chipped nail,

09:39.046 --> 09:40.545
There goes a career.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.313
It's true.
I had a friend.

09:41.315 --> 09:44.583
She burned her thumb
making pancakes,
and that was it.

09:44.585 --> 09:46.284
She's a substitute
teacher now.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.586
Show them how
it's done, honey.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.322
Oh.
You're gonna love this.

09:51.891 --> 09:52.657
Shelley: Nice.
Wow.

09:52.659 --> 09:53.992
And you would think
doing such exacting work

09:53.994 --> 09:55.860
That she would earn
a solid wage, but...

09:55.862 --> 09:58.096
No. Peanuts.
So we were thinking,

09:58.098 --> 09:59.831
Me and austin,
about going

09:59.833 --> 10:01.633
In an entirely
new direction.

10:01.635 --> 10:03.001
Lingerie modeling.
Virginia: Hmm.

10:03.003 --> 10:06.671
I can't picture you
in lingerie, austin.

10:06.673 --> 10:07.872
(laughter)

10:07.874 --> 10:09.341
Austin says the less
I wear, the better.

10:09.343 --> 10:12.243
So I thought,
why not get paid for
my god-given gifts?

10:12.245 --> 10:13.912
It's funny.
Lingerie happens to be

10:13.914 --> 10:15.714
Something I know
a lot about.

10:15.716 --> 10:18.683
Yes, shelley
is a girdle salesman.

10:18.685 --> 10:21.920
Actually, there's a modeling
agency in our new building.

10:21.922 --> 10:25.490
I'm not sure
what type of modeling
they specialize in,

10:25.492 --> 10:28.693
But...
But why not find out?

10:28.695 --> 10:29.894
Yeah.

10:29.896 --> 10:34.132
Austin loves
my hands, loves...

10:34.400 --> 10:35.700
But why limit myself?

10:35.702 --> 10:37.168
Why think closed
when the world is open?

10:37.170 --> 10:40.772
Why think small
when the world
is so big?

10:40.774 --> 10:43.341
So big.
(both chuckle)

10:49.782 --> 10:53.752
Libby: I want to
plant a garden in the
side yard.

10:54.186 --> 10:56.021
I love gardens.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.123
You plant beans,
you get beans.

10:58.125 --> 11:00.091
Carrots become carrots.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.928
Set out to make
something grow,
and it does.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.831
You wanted a clinic
of your own.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.401
Deep down,
you probably always did.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.836
And now you have it.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.838
I envy you.

11:13.840 --> 11:18.643
You've reached your goal,
I guess you could say.

11:18.978 --> 11:21.980
My goal is to
have a family.

11:22.214 --> 11:25.417
Well, that's why
we have the boy.

11:26.786 --> 11:29.387
Family meaning
more than one.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.094
You know
what that entails, lib.

11:37.730 --> 11:41.266
We can't just
flip a switch.
It's, uh...

11:41.268 --> 11:45.937
It's fertility treatments,
more fertility treatments,

11:46.472 --> 11:48.206
Disappointment,

11:48.208 --> 11:50.175
Maybe heartbreak.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.644
Please.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.613
This is what I need.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.689
(indistinct conversations)

12:10.496 --> 12:13.364
It's like we're fated
or something.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.101
Always showing up
at the exact same place

12:16.103 --> 12:18.603
At the exact same time.

12:19.872 --> 12:23.842
You're not gonna
regret this, hiring me.

12:25.544 --> 12:26.311
Although, it's funny.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.913
This morning,
I was putting on my
last pair of stockings,

12:28.915 --> 12:32.217
Hole in each big toe,
and I thought to myself...

12:32.219 --> 12:33.551
Why did the doc
give me this job,

12:33.553 --> 12:37.889
Considering we've both
been at each other
like two cats in a bag?

12:37.891 --> 12:42.327
Well, you've, uh,
you've helped me
out before...

12:42.895 --> 12:44.462
Twice, in fact.

12:44.464 --> 12:48.433
When things were
as dire for me as
they are for you now.

12:48.701 --> 12:52.137
So you could say
I'm a man who believes
in repaying the debt.

12:52.139 --> 12:54.405
(elevator dings)

13:02.414 --> 13:05.416
Simon: What makes
this tricky is
you seem to have

13:05.418 --> 13:07.485
No credit history
at all.

13:07.487 --> 13:10.722
So, because I'm,
uh, not up to my
neck in debt,

13:10.724 --> 13:11.656
That makes me
a credit risk?

13:11.658 --> 13:15.160
Up until recently,
you were drawing
regular paychecks

13:15.162 --> 13:17.195
From several major
st. Louis hospitals,
but now...

13:17.197 --> 13:21.833
Now I'm an entrepreneur.
As you can see,
I've opened this practice,

13:21.835 --> 13:23.701
Overseen its refurbishing.

13:23.703 --> 13:26.104
That takes capital,
mr. Durang.

13:26.106 --> 13:28.740
Are you not in the business
of providing loans

13:28.742 --> 13:31.109
To new businesses?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.877
(chuckles)

13:32.879 --> 13:35.213
It's funny with doctors.

13:36.215 --> 13:36.848
I missed the joke.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.584
They are notoriously
bad businessmen.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.120
In fact, we have
a saying at walcohl bank

13:42.122 --> 13:43.922
That if doctors were
in charge of wall street,

13:43.924 --> 13:46.157
It would still be
a saltwater swamp.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.860
So you're rejecting
my application?
No, no.

13:48.862 --> 13:49.961
I can get
this loan approved,

13:49.963 --> 13:54.199
But we are gonna use
your assets.
All your assets,

13:54.201 --> 13:54.766
As collateral.

13:54.768 --> 13:57.669
I'm talking
your house, your cars,
any savings accounts,

13:57.671 --> 14:02.674
Investments so that
if you do go the way
of most doctors...

14:02.676 --> 14:04.142
(clicks tongue)

14:04.144 --> 14:08.713
We know we'll get
our money back
one way or the other.

14:19.258 --> 14:22.694
Dr. Masters:
What's he waiting for,
a checkered flag?

14:22.696 --> 14:27.065
I told mr. Boychuck
he could take his time.

14:28.834 --> 14:31.836
The 98th observation

14:31.838 --> 14:34.038
Of male respiration

14:34.040 --> 14:37.909
Monitored through
the four stages.

14:39.111 --> 14:41.512
Oh, stage one.

14:42.114 --> 14:43.648
Finally.

14:43.650 --> 14:45.283
Beginning at...

14:46.185 --> 14:47.685
Ah!

14:55.361 --> 14:56.227
(sighs)

14:56.229 --> 14:58.096
$10 we paid mr. Boychuck.

14:58.098 --> 15:01.532
$10 now out the window,
because no data
can be gleaned

15:01.534 --> 15:06.337
From a subject
who orgasms in under
five seconds.

15:06.339 --> 15:09.040
We can no longer make
these kinds of mistakes.

15:09.042 --> 15:12.443
I think that we should
expand the questionnaire.

15:12.445 --> 15:16.014
Might help to
weed out the people
that aren't suitable.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.750
Well, I suggest
you do that soon.

15:18.752 --> 15:22.854
I will start on it
first thing in the morning.

15:26.525 --> 15:28.693
I'm going to
head out now.

15:31.497 --> 15:33.564
I drove by the park plaza
the other night.

15:33.566 --> 15:38.503
It was all I could do
to keep from going in,
having a drink.

15:40.239 --> 15:42.273
Ever have that impulse?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.909
I'm not much
of a history buff.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.578
Bill, please.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.481
I suppose that
you could punish me
forever, but I...

15:50.483 --> 15:53.151
I'm not punishing you.
Yes, you are,

15:53.153 --> 15:54.552
But it's unreasonable.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.487
You go home to someone
every night.

15:56.489 --> 16:00.591
Why can't I
go home to...
Fill in the blank?

16:00.659 --> 16:01.926
You know I'm sorry, bill.

16:01.928 --> 16:05.930
I've said it many times,
even though you
refuse to listen.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.165
But I will
say it again.

16:07.167 --> 16:10.234
I regret that night
that you went by
my house.

16:10.236 --> 16:11.869
I know seeing shelley
there was a shock.

16:11.871 --> 16:17.041
If you're gonna
stand here and press
the matter, virginia...

16:17.043 --> 16:22.347
The real shock
that night was
your child.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.881
The night I stood
on your doorstep,

16:23.883 --> 16:25.149
I wasn't looking
at shelley.

16:25.151 --> 16:26.584
I was looking at
your daughter.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.987
Wrapped around
this stranger's leg...

16:28.989 --> 16:32.857
One of how many strangers
that have met your children

16:32.859 --> 16:35.994
In their way
in and out of your bed.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.530
And I thought,
I cannot be
a part of this.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.466
I know something
of what children
carry through

16:41.468 --> 16:44.769
From their childhoods,
how they need
a good mother,

16:44.771 --> 16:45.636
A present mother.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.940
And I know better
than to be yet
another man

16:48.942 --> 16:52.610
Who parades through
their lives while the mother
they do have

16:52.612 --> 16:55.680
Tries to keep clean
sheets on the bed.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.388
(scoffs)

17:05.958 --> 17:08.559
You cannot keep
this up, bill.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.060
You can't.

17:09.062 --> 17:12.330
There's nothing
to keep up, virginia.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.700
We're work colleagues,
nothing else.

18:06.385 --> 18:07.919
Yvette: (sighs)
nothing's happening.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.655
How long do you
want me to try?

18:11.857 --> 18:13.458
(zipper closes)

18:13.460 --> 18:15.660
(cash crinkles)

18:27.539 --> 18:30.141
It's like it's our own
little city down here.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.544
Um, our offices are
on the second floor.

18:33.546 --> 18:35.713
I'm embarrassed
it's taken me
long to visit.

18:35.715 --> 18:38.149
It's, um...
(clears throat)

18:38.250 --> 18:40.284
It's really very...

18:40.286 --> 18:42.854
There was a man
urinating on the
wall outside.

18:42.856 --> 18:45.156
Ah, the neighborhood's
in transition,
as they say.

18:45.158 --> 18:48.059
Recession's not
helping much, either,
but that just means

18:48.061 --> 18:50.862
There's one direction
to go, and that's up.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.597
Uh, there's
stalin's gift shop.

18:52.599 --> 18:56.501
Uh, about as popular
as the plague these days.

18:56.503 --> 18:57.502
And that's our resident
modeling agency.

18:57.504 --> 19:01.305
And by modeling agency,
I mean "joint that books
burlesque girls."

19:01.307 --> 19:03.241
Ah.
Uh, and finally...

19:03.243 --> 19:04.108
No more chinese takeout.

19:04.110 --> 19:09.113
Hallelujah for
a cheeseburger at
a good old greasy spoon.

19:09.115 --> 19:11.015
Two kids now?

19:11.116 --> 19:12.583
Yes.

19:12.684 --> 19:17.255
Uh, I asked bill how
the plans for the
new lab are coming.

19:17.257 --> 19:18.389
Still plans.

19:18.391 --> 19:19.457
But to be
perfectly honest,

19:19.459 --> 19:21.526
I've been telling
your husband
for the last year

19:21.528 --> 19:23.127
He should rent
this space.

19:23.129 --> 19:26.297
It'd be better
for our end of year report.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.101
Didn't realize
you knew about
real estate, betty.

19:30.103 --> 19:32.503
I just finished
my real estate tax class.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.072
Uh, I'm halfway
to my accounting degree.
Oh.

19:35.074 --> 19:39.677
I figure a woman
that's stupid about money
is a stupid woman.

19:39.679 --> 19:40.978
I learned that
the hard way.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.881
Hey, come here.
Yeah, come here.

19:43.883 --> 19:45.483
You're mommy's got
to go in there.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.784
I know.
Got her?

19:46.786 --> 19:47.718
Yeah, got her.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.521
All right,
let me take that, too.
Just in case.

19:50.523 --> 19:52.056
(sighs)
you're a lifesaver.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.758
Got it.
I know.

19:53.760 --> 19:56.861
Yeah, now you're
with uncle betty.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.229
<i>September 2, 1959.</i>

19:58.231 --> 20:02.567
<i>Background interview,</i>
<i>virginia johnson part one.</i>

20:03.068 --> 20:04.802
<i>Tell me about</i>
<i>the questionnaire.</i>

20:04.804 --> 20:08.039
<i>You see, a fair number</i>
<i>of study applicants</i>

20:08.041 --> 20:09.907
<i>Suffer from</i>
<i>sexual dysfunctions.</i>

20:09.909 --> 20:13.377
<i>Uh, dysfunctions that</i>
<i>make it difficult for</i>
<i>them to progress</i>

20:13.379 --> 20:14.979
<i>Through the four stages</i>
<i>of sexual response.</i>

20:14.981 --> 20:19.116
<i>And since our data does</i>
<i>depend on normally</i>
<i>functioning participants,</i>

20:19.118 --> 20:22.253
<i>This questionnaire,</i>
<i>it helps to catch</i>
<i>a dysfunction</i>

20:22.255 --> 20:25.856
<i>Before it lands</i>
<i>on our exam table.</i>

20:26.124 --> 20:27.325
Lester:
<i>The questionnaire's become</i>

20:27.327 --> 20:29.193
<i>Sort of a weeding out</i>
<i>process.</i>

20:29.195 --> 20:31.529
<i>Yes. Exactly right.</i>

20:35.767 --> 20:37.335
<i>Uh, lester, I'm sorry.</i>

20:37.337 --> 20:39.870
<i>Why are, why are you</i>
<i>filming this?</i>

20:39.872 --> 20:43.407
My inspiration
at the moment is
"windjammer."

20:43.409 --> 20:44.141
It's a documentary.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.577
The true story of
a 17,000 nautical mile
journey

20:46.579 --> 20:50.114
Of a norwegian
sailing ship,
<i>the christian radich,</i>

20:50.116 --> 20:51.716
Directed by
louis de rosemont iii

20:51.718 --> 20:54.852
And shot in a widescreen
cine-miracle process

20:54.854 --> 20:56.988
With a seven track
stereophonic soundtrack.

20:56.990 --> 21:00.658
(chuckles) but that's
not the reason it
changed my life.

21:00.859 --> 21:03.327
Oh, it changed your life.

21:03.829 --> 21:07.798
The story of windjammer,
is the story of real life.

21:07.800 --> 21:12.436
Danger, tragedy,
triumph, risk.

21:12.571 --> 21:16.941
And it's what we're,
you're doing here, too.

21:17.709 --> 21:21.412
Your study
is real life.

21:21.647 --> 21:23.514
Dr. Masters:  <i>Libby.</i>

21:25.017 --> 21:26.117
I came to
share with you

21:26.119 --> 21:30.221
The interesting
conversation I had with
simon this morning.

21:30.223 --> 21:31.188
Simon?

21:31.190 --> 21:32.890
The man
from the bank.

21:32.892 --> 21:35.192
Found him poking around
in our bushes.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.561
Turns out,
he was reassessing
the property.

21:37.563 --> 21:39.730
I didn't realize
it had been assessed

21:39.732 --> 21:41.932
In the first place.

21:41.934 --> 21:44.001
When did you
take out a loan?

21:44.003 --> 21:45.636
A year ago.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.972
And you haven't
paid it back?

21:47.974 --> 21:49.106
How very uncharacteristic
of you.

21:49.108 --> 21:53.544
It's all perfectly
routine when you
start your,

21:53.546 --> 21:55.146
Your own business.

21:55.280 --> 21:59.417
Takes money
to make money,
and, uh...

21:59.918 --> 22:01.952
We're not selling
the house.

22:01.954 --> 22:04.255
I know we're not.

22:05.023 --> 22:07.591
That would only happen
in a worst-case scenario.

22:07.593 --> 22:08.793
The man was
in our bushes...

22:08.795 --> 22:11.595
We will not
have to sell the house.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.364
How do,
how do I know that?

22:13.366 --> 22:15.132
That if sacrifices
have to be made,

22:15.134 --> 22:17.335
They'll be made here
at work?

22:17.337 --> 22:19.403
Why would I uproot you
and the children

22:19.405 --> 22:21.038
To subsidize our work?

22:21.040 --> 22:24.608
My work?
Why would I do my best
to make you happy,

22:24.610 --> 22:27.311
Then turn around
and undo it all?

22:30.248 --> 22:32.717
(soft music plays)

22:41.193 --> 22:43.327
(telephone ringing)

22:50.469 --> 22:51.635
Hello?

22:51.637 --> 22:55.072
Oh, I'm so glad
you got my message.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.141
(elevator dings)

23:18.397 --> 23:21.899
Libby told me
you worked here now.

23:22.401 --> 23:23.868
You spoke to libby?

23:23.870 --> 23:25.936
I've been
speaking to libby

23:25.938 --> 23:29.006
For over
a year now, son.

23:29.307 --> 23:32.943
In fact,
I see her regularly

23:33.311 --> 23:34.745
And my grandchildren.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.281
I had intended to
stay away forever, billy.

23:37.283 --> 23:42.319
I knew that's
what you wanted,
given how we parted.

23:42.687 --> 23:44.722
But then I...

23:45.290 --> 23:48.559
I just couldn't
stay away...

23:48.827 --> 23:53.330
Cut off from
all I hold dear.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.269
So when libby called,
I suggested that we meet,

23:58.271 --> 24:01.539
And I was prepared
to tell her everything.

24:04.242 --> 24:08.112
But then one look
at that sweet face,

24:08.447 --> 24:10.481
And I couldn't.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.918
I couldn't hurt her
like that.

24:14.319 --> 24:17.087
And I couldn't
hurt you.

24:20.592 --> 24:25.496
So whatever secrets
you may have,
they're safe.

24:26.898 --> 24:30.401
They've been safe
for a long time.

24:34.272 --> 24:36.507
I don't judge you.

24:36.509 --> 24:38.442
I don't want to.

24:39.010 --> 24:41.545
What you do,
what you don't do,

24:41.547 --> 24:45.516
It's not my place
to judge my own son.

24:46.117 --> 24:49.019
My place is
to love you.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.921
Just that.

24:51.122 --> 24:52.957
And I do.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.860
And so I...

24:55.862 --> 24:56.927
I'm asking for
another chance.

24:56.929 --> 25:00.631
If you say no,
if you tell me to
go away again,

25:01.466 --> 25:02.666
I will.

25:02.668 --> 25:05.469
But I'm hoping
you don't.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.442
Is that what
you've come to say?

25:11.843 --> 25:14.512
There is one
other thing.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.314
One thing
I want to do,

25:17.816 --> 25:19.149
To help.

25:23.421 --> 25:26.156
We are taking
that money.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.993
You know,
what I'm trying
to understand

25:28.995 --> 25:31.061
Is that for over a year,

25:31.063 --> 25:34.265
You have been meeting
with my mother once a week

25:34.267 --> 25:35.399
In terre haute,
indiana.

25:35.401 --> 25:37.668
It's the midway point.
After I told you

25:37.670 --> 25:39.003
We were done with her.
You

25:39.005 --> 25:41.405
Were done with her.
I need her.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.374
She is good to me.
I don't have a mother,

25:43.376 --> 25:47.144
And I am not gonna
deprive our children
of their grandmother.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.178
The answer is no.

25:48.180 --> 25:50.948
You're not gonna take
my mother's money.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.783
It is your money.

25:52.785 --> 25:54.118
Our money.

25:54.120 --> 25:57.154
With your father's
estate settled,
it's just sitting there.

25:57.156 --> 25:58.455
Essie wants us
to have it.

25:58.457 --> 26:01.158
There is nothing left
to discuss.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.961
You deceived me,
you went behind my back.

26:03.963 --> 26:04.628
Not for the first time.

26:04.630 --> 26:08.365
I am not the
enemy here, bill,
nor is essie.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.934
She is offering
to help us.

26:09.936 --> 26:13.504
My mother, my mother
cannot be counted on.

26:13.506 --> 26:14.572
She is not
to be trusted.

26:14.574 --> 26:17.107
Trusted to do what?
To be good to us?

26:17.109 --> 26:19.076
To help us keep a roof
over our heads?

26:19.078 --> 26:21.478
I provide the roof!

26:22.981 --> 26:25.816
I have always
provided the roof!

26:25.818 --> 26:29.119
Trying to explain
my mother or
any of this to you,

26:29.121 --> 26:33.390
It's like trying to teach
a horse to count!

26:33.392 --> 26:37.294
All these years,
it's right in
front of you,

26:37.296 --> 26:39.330
Yet you refuse to see it!

26:39.332 --> 26:40.965
You refuse to understand!

26:40.967 --> 26:42.099
That you're in pain?

26:42.101 --> 26:47.204
That you are nursing
some grievous wound
from years ago?

26:48.039 --> 26:49.974
Who isn't, bill?

26:49.976 --> 26:53.477
Point to one person
in this entire world

26:53.479 --> 26:54.878
Who isn't suffering!

26:54.880 --> 26:59.750
Yet it is only you
that insists on spreading
the torment around.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.620
Only you that
makes all of us

27:02.622 --> 27:04.822
Suffer along with you.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.599
The matter's closed.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.868
You will not touch
that money.

27:18.336 --> 27:20.804
And I suggest
you get dressed.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.907
We're already late.

27:23.909 --> 27:26.176
All:  <i>â™ª for he's</i>
<i>a jolly good fellow</i>

27:26.178 --> 27:28.512
<i>â™ª for he's</i>
<i>a jolly good fellow</i>

27:28.514 --> 27:32.783
<i>â™ª for he's</i>
<i>a jolly good fellow</i>

27:32.785 --> 27:36.086
<i>â™ª which nobody can deny</i>

27:36.088 --> 27:38.489
(all cheering)

27:52.637 --> 27:54.738
I just wanted
to say thank you,

27:54.740 --> 27:55.639
Everyone,
for coming out tonight.

27:55.641 --> 27:59.009
I've never seen
a girl pop out of
a cake before.

27:59.011 --> 28:00.611
I thought you said
she was a hand model.

28:00.613 --> 28:03.714
Apparently, holly
has moved on
to burlesque.

28:03.716 --> 28:07.751
Austin: And we really hope
you stay all night,
drink all night.

28:07.753 --> 28:10.621
Thank you,
thank you for coming!

28:10.623 --> 28:11.622
Thank you.

28:11.624 --> 28:14.525
(upbeat music playing)

28:16.995 --> 28:23.067
<i>â™ª sparks just fly</i>
<i>right out of the blue</i>

28:23.069 --> 28:26.970
<i>â™ª there's no way</i>
<i>I can deny</i>

28:26.972 --> 28:29.740
<i>â™ª the magic of you</i>

28:29.742 --> 28:32.776
<i>â™ª our eyes meet</i>

28:32.778 --> 28:35.312
<i>â™ª and that is your cue</i>

28:35.314 --> 28:38.315
<i>â™ª suddenly my</i>
<i>heart's complete</i>

28:38.317 --> 28:40.284
<i>â™ª with the magic of you</i>

28:40.286 --> 28:43.187
Glass appears
to be empty.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.590
There's a remedy
for that.

28:50.795 --> 28:53.263
Would you like another,
as well?

28:53.265 --> 28:55.632
<i>â™ª sleight of hand</i>

28:55.634 --> 28:58.135
<i>â™ª yes, that could be true</i>

28:58.137 --> 29:01.271
<i>â™ª there's no way I can deny</i>

29:01.273 --> 29:03.941
<i>â™ª the magic of you</i>

29:05.710 --> 29:07.745
Kenny: Dr. Masters.

29:10.515 --> 29:12.816
I insisted
she introduce me.

29:12.818 --> 29:14.885
Kenny hitchens.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.789
Gini speaks
so highly of you,

29:18.791 --> 29:21.024
All the work
you two are doing.

29:21.392 --> 29:23.127
Does she?

29:23.129 --> 29:26.230
Anyway, now that
you've said your hellos...

29:26.232 --> 29:27.297
No, no.
Well, it is,

29:27.299 --> 29:29.733
It is important work
we're engaged in.

29:29.735 --> 29:31.034
Has virginia
explained to you

29:31.036 --> 29:34.071
That we monitor subjects
while they have sex?

29:34.073 --> 29:37.141
Usually in an exam room,
occasionally

29:37.143 --> 29:39.009
In a hotel.

29:39.477 --> 29:42.312
I didn't know
the specifics.

29:42.547 --> 29:43.747
Well, it sounds
fascinating.

29:43.749 --> 29:47.217
Well, we would be
very happy to
have you join us

29:47.219 --> 29:48.719
If you are interested,
as a subject.

29:48.721 --> 29:52.856
You wouldn't have
to participate on
your own, of course.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.024
I'd pair you
with virginia.

29:54.026 --> 29:57.127
(chuckles)
dr. Masters
has been drinking.

29:57.129 --> 30:00.364
And gini's
strictly a behind the...

30:01.332 --> 30:02.633
I mean, you don't
do the actual...
No.

30:02.635 --> 30:06.370
Dr. Masters:
Oh, she does do
quite well, in fact.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.338
We could, uh, start

30:08.340 --> 30:10.941
By monitoring different
sexual positions,

30:10.943 --> 30:13.911
Begin with the old
standby missionary pose.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.213
Unless there's another
you two prefer.

30:16.215 --> 30:19.850
In fact, he's drunk,
embarrassingly so.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.985
Well, do consider it.

30:40.238 --> 30:41.839
(sighs)

30:42.073 --> 30:45.843
I see you've found
the last place of refuge.

30:46.377 --> 30:49.780
Oh, I quit smoking during
my fertility treatments.

30:49.782 --> 30:51.014
Oh...
But you go ahead.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.984
It may be the only fun
of the night.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.657
Bill certainly has had
a lot to drink tonight.

31:00.659 --> 31:03.060
I think bill
may have lost his mind.

31:03.461 --> 31:06.163
Yes. I do, too.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.298
(both chuckle)

31:08.300 --> 31:12.135
But we had
a terrible fight.

31:12.137 --> 31:13.503
I'm sorry.

31:13.505 --> 31:15.239
Why are you apologizing?

31:15.241 --> 31:16.640
He's the one
that should apologize.

31:16.642 --> 31:20.544
I think he fears
an apology would
weaken him.

31:20.546 --> 31:24.681
I think he fears
so many things.

31:25.016 --> 31:28.952
Intimacy with me,
physically.

31:30.121 --> 31:33.891
Did you know
that we haven't had sex
in over a year?

31:37.195 --> 31:39.229
I mean, I've asked,
I've asked him why,
of course.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.297
He says it's the
new building

31:40.299 --> 31:43.133
And the new clinic
and the new baby,

31:43.135 --> 31:47.337
That he's just wiped out
by the end of the day.

31:47.339 --> 31:49.439
And that's...

31:49.540 --> 31:51.775
That's probably true.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.478
Do you think it is?

31:54.480 --> 31:58.181
I think bill is under
a lot of pressure.

32:01.152 --> 32:04.121
I was in california once
as a child,

32:04.123 --> 32:04.888
And I woke up to find

32:04.890 --> 32:07.224
That I'd been thrown
from the bed

32:07.226 --> 32:08.325
Like a rag doll,

32:08.327 --> 32:10.093
Just flung
across the room.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.196
When I asked my aunt,
she had to explain to me

32:13.198 --> 32:14.998
That we live
on these giant plates

32:15.000 --> 32:16.566
That push against
each other,

32:16.568 --> 32:20.437
The pressure just
building and building until

32:20.571 --> 32:24.308
One day they break away
from each other

32:24.310 --> 32:26.810
With a violent jolt.

32:46.097 --> 32:50.934
I can wait here
all night until
you apologize.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.976
I want you
to look at this.

33:19.097 --> 33:21.465
That is one world.

33:24.535 --> 33:28.271
And this is the other.

33:47.225 --> 33:49.159
I am sorry.

33:51.362 --> 33:54.097
I'm sorry
for being weak.

33:55.099 --> 33:57.634
I'm sorry
that I lied.

33:58.569 --> 34:02.039
I'm sorry for shelley
and kenny,

34:02.774 --> 34:05.876
Ethan and george,

34:06.644 --> 34:09.579
All the men
who came before,

34:09.581 --> 34:12.416
All the men
that lie ahead.

34:13.351 --> 34:14.785
But most of all, bill,

34:14.787 --> 34:18.855
I'm sorry for my faithless
and fickle heart.

34:23.528 --> 34:25.429
(chuckles)

34:46.684 --> 34:48.885
(gasping softly)

34:57.595 --> 34:58.628
Sandra: Can't take
your money.

34:58.630 --> 35:01.598
You're getting nothing
out of this.

35:03.568 --> 35:05.235
Do you...

35:05.237 --> 35:07.504
Do you want me to stop?

35:11.542 --> 35:12.042
Argh!

35:12.044 --> 35:15.412
Typography, that's, uh...
That's books, right?

35:15.414 --> 35:18.048
Uh, it's designing
the type within books.

35:18.050 --> 35:21.051
Oh, um, that used
to be the reds.

35:21.053 --> 35:22.819
Now it's, uh,
colored folks.

35:22.821 --> 35:26.089
Uh, core stands
for, uh, uh...

35:26.757 --> 35:27.657
Congress of racial equality.

35:27.659 --> 35:31.094
Yeah, and they're
raring to go, too,
god bless them.

35:31.096 --> 35:33.130
Anyhoo, uh,
we're a medical operation,

35:33.132 --> 35:36.566
And the space
we'd lease to you
shares this lobby here,

35:36.568 --> 35:42.105
A 24 karat location
with a lot of
foot traffic,

35:42.107 --> 35:45.308
You being
a foot doctor
and all.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.276
Feet are not a joke.

35:46.278 --> 35:49.713
I know that.
They are a business.

35:49.715 --> 35:50.247
(elevator dings)

35:50.249 --> 35:52.916
Which is why
I'm telling you that
modeling agency there

35:52.918 --> 35:56.486
Comes with a lot of girls
on their feet. (chuckles)

35:56.488 --> 36:00.223
And, uh, on their back
if you believe the rumor

36:00.225 --> 36:02.526
That they're into
skin flicks now.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.327
I, uh, heard from
a friend of a friend

36:04.329 --> 36:08.598
That the new thing
in burlesque is
actual nudity.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.366
Did you hear that?

36:09.368 --> 36:11.401
What I don't understand
is why no one else here

36:11.403 --> 36:13.837
Has to deal
with your carping,
your threats,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.639
Your never-ending
bean counting.

36:15.641 --> 36:17.641
I aced my cpa exams,

36:17.643 --> 36:20.677
So careful who you
call bean counter.

36:20.679 --> 36:23.713
We leased you
prime space, flo,
and yet every month,

36:23.715 --> 36:25.282
All you got is
another lame excuse.

36:25.284 --> 36:28.151
Yeah, well,
times are tough,
in case you can't read.

36:28.153 --> 36:29.085
(scoffs)
I'm not sure

36:29.087 --> 36:31.221
I can scrape together
this month's rent.

36:31.223 --> 36:34.291
You move more blubber
through this place

36:34.293 --> 36:36.459
Than a japanese
whaling ship.

36:36.461 --> 36:41.031
You will scrape, flo,
and you will scrape now.

36:51.576 --> 36:54.044
The next time
you start singing
this song,

36:54.046 --> 36:57.147
I'm slapping you
with a late fee.

36:57.381 --> 36:58.748
<i>October 11, 1960.</i>

36:58.750 --> 37:02.652
<i>Background b roll</i>
<i>various subjects part 6.</i>

37:04.188 --> 37:04.821
<i>She pays in cash</i>

37:04.823 --> 37:06.790
<i>Hoping we'll get mugged</i>
<i>on the way to the bank.</i>

37:06.792 --> 37:10.227
<i>Tell her this is</i>
<i>an actual business,</i>

37:10.229 --> 37:13.663
<i>Not a flea market</i>
<i>in ancient rome.</i>

37:15.466 --> 37:16.766
<i>Lester!</i>

37:16.768 --> 37:18.935
<i>Not when we're talking</i>
<i>about money.</i>

37:18.937 --> 37:23.373
Lester:  <i>Of course.</i>
<i>Although, money is part,</i>
<i>right.</i>

37:27.445 --> 37:29.312
Betty: He's an odd duck,
that one.

37:29.314 --> 37:30.981
My point is,
tell flo

37:30.983 --> 37:33.283
From now on,
she has to pay
with a check

37:33.285 --> 37:34.084
Like everybody else.

37:34.086 --> 37:36.686
Oh, speaking of,
I got a pile of checks
for you to sign.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.454
Start on the top.

37:37.456 --> 37:39.389
The first one's for the
new blood pressure cuff.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.825
I thought we couldn't
afford a new
blood pressure cuff.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.894
Oh, we can now.
Because?

37:45.263 --> 37:49.466
Because our
fertility patient numbers
are finally up,

37:49.468 --> 37:51.268
Plus I raised our fees.

37:51.270 --> 37:54.070
So we're actually
looking at a 20 percent
increase in revenue

37:54.072 --> 37:57.107
From last month,
which is not nothing

37:57.109 --> 37:58.708
Thanks to me.

37:59.543 --> 38:01.344
(elevator dings)

38:04.915 --> 38:07.984
I'll get you
those numbers tomorrow.

38:11.555 --> 38:12.922
Shelley?

38:13.090 --> 38:14.257
Gini.

38:14.259 --> 38:15.925
Wow, you look fantastic.

38:15.927 --> 38:19.029
Thank you.
You look
so fit yourself.

38:19.031 --> 38:19.796
Do you work here now?

38:19.798 --> 38:21.398
I mean, are you still
with the study?

38:21.400 --> 38:25.335
Yes, the study
is going very well,

38:25.503 --> 38:28.204
And your,
your work.
How is...

38:28.406 --> 38:30.173
Girdle salesman.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.376
Of course.
It's a hard one
to forget.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.011
Not too hard,
apparently.

38:35.013 --> 38:38.481
And, uh, henry and tessa,
they're doing well?

38:38.483 --> 38:39.349
Yes, very well.

38:39.351 --> 38:41.117
Uh, henry is
a voracious reader,

38:41.119 --> 38:43.286
And tess, she just
joined brownies.

38:43.288 --> 38:45.755
And your kids,
how are...

38:45.923 --> 38:46.690
Haven't been born yet.

38:46.692 --> 38:51.494
I'm still single,
looking for a nice girl
to settle down with.

38:51.496 --> 38:54.297
And once upon a time,
I hoped it'd be you.

38:54.299 --> 38:58.868
But then I would've
had to have made
some kind of impression,

38:59.337 --> 39:00.970
Wouldn't I have?

39:01.038 --> 39:02.872
Hmm. Take care.

39:03.140 --> 39:05.041
Shelley...

39:07.712 --> 39:09.979
(elevator dings)

39:16.354 --> 39:17.921
(knock on door)

39:18.055 --> 39:20.023
Mrs. Wilder is waiting.

39:20.025 --> 39:23.159
Uh, refractory
response times.

39:24.328 --> 39:25.695
What is that?

39:25.697 --> 39:26.996
I'm just cataloging
all my footage

39:26.998 --> 39:30.200
That's from our time
at maternity.

39:30.901 --> 39:32.936
From two years ago.

39:52.256 --> 39:53.656
Yes?

39:59.797 --> 40:03.233
Room 412.
Chancery park plaza.

40:03.434 --> 40:04.467
I'll wait for
a few hours.

40:04.469 --> 40:06.669
If you haven't shown up
by the shift change,

40:06.671 --> 40:09.506
I will assume
you're not coming.

40:18.816 --> 40:21.317
Aside from my children,

40:21.552 --> 40:23.586
Everything I have

40:24.288 --> 40:27.257
Is permanently,
inexorably

40:27.259 --> 40:30.360
Tied to this work,
our work,

40:30.761 --> 40:32.128
To you.

40:34.899 --> 40:36.132
Sometimes in the past,

40:36.134 --> 40:41.137
After a late night
at the hospital
or the hotel,

40:41.906 --> 40:44.974
Sometimes I would
feel almost sick

40:44.976 --> 40:46.676
At the unfairness of it,

40:46.678 --> 40:48.878
That you would
go home to libby

40:48.880 --> 40:51.347
While I went home
utterly alone.

40:51.349 --> 40:54.851
Well, you've compensated
admirably enough.
No.

40:54.853 --> 41:01.157
You see, I can't even
remember their names
more often than not.

41:01.559 --> 41:05.762
But you,
on the other hand...

41:07.198 --> 41:11.067
Well, it's hard
to tell where you stop
and I begin.

41:11.735 --> 41:14.070
You have more of me
than you even realize,
and yet

41:14.072 --> 41:19.142
You focus on other men
while you yourself
are married?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.977
(exhales sharply)

41:21.645 --> 41:24.214
Just because one

41:24.381 --> 41:27.050
Goes home
to someone...

41:28.519 --> 41:31.387
Doesn't mean
they're not alone.

41:35.559 --> 41:38.495
Well, then,
we are fellow sufferers.

41:38.662 --> 41:40.396
Are we?

41:43.167 --> 41:45.301
Are we really?

41:46.904 --> 41:49.939
Whatever this is
between us,

41:50.741 --> 41:53.243
It can't be undone,

41:53.245 --> 41:56.713
Not without
a violent wrenching
much worse

41:56.715 --> 42:01.117
Than this undeclared war
we have between us now.

42:02.553 --> 42:04.087
For me,

42:04.421 --> 42:07.624
What we have
comes first,

42:08.259 --> 42:11.127
And you can
count on that.

42:12.162 --> 42:13.663
But you must
allow me something,

42:13.665 --> 42:18.701
Someone to hold on to
while you hold on to libby.

42:19.370 --> 42:23.840
Just show me
enough compassion
to allow me that.

42:27.378 --> 42:28.411
(elevator dings)
my buddy hank

42:28.413 --> 42:29.646
Thinks this is
such a kick,

42:29.648 --> 42:31.981
Us filming
all this tonight.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.182
Well, you're paying.

42:33.184 --> 42:34.951
Well, everybody's
filming everything

42:34.953 --> 42:37.420
These days, so...
Right.

42:37.422 --> 42:38.855
We'll have a drink
while we set up.

42:38.857 --> 42:41.124
Oh, that's okay.
I don't, uh, really...

42:41.126 --> 42:42.625
Don't really what?
Have fun?

42:42.627 --> 42:44.994
It's a bachelor party
for cripes' sake.

42:44.996 --> 42:48.097
Truth is, lester,
we have a lot in common.

42:48.099 --> 42:49.732
I can't think of
one thing.

42:49.734 --> 42:51.200
Jane.

42:51.969 --> 42:53.670
All I am saying is...

42:53.871 --> 42:56.506
Don't make a shrine
out of one woman.

42:56.508 --> 42:58.708
Just change religions.

42:58.710 --> 43:00.543
(keys jingle)

43:00.545 --> 43:02.378
(all laughing)

43:07.284 --> 43:10.386
<i>I'd like to</i>
<i>make a toast.</i>

43:11.288 --> 43:12.689
(whistles)

43:12.691 --> 43:14.958
(men cheering)

43:14.960 --> 43:17.594
<i>All right,</i>
<i>a toast to hank.</i>

43:17.596 --> 43:18.461
(men cheering)

43:18.463 --> 43:21.230
<i>Our proverbial lamb</i>
<i>to slaughter.</i>

43:21.232 --> 43:22.665
<i>Oh, okay!</i>
<i>Okay.</i>

43:22.667 --> 43:24.934
<i>Goodbye to the days</i>
<i>of wanton sex,</i>

43:24.936 --> 43:30.039
<i>A glance across</i>
<i>a crowded bar ending</i>
<i>in tangled sheets.</i>

43:30.207 --> 43:32.408
<i>And hello to meatloaf,</i>
<i>jack paar,</i>

43:32.410 --> 43:34.377
<i>And faces smeared</i>
<i>with so much cold cream,</i>

43:34.379 --> 43:37.347
<i>It looks like they took</i>
<i>a pie in the face!</i>

43:37.349 --> 43:38.281
All:  <i>Oh!</i>

43:38.283 --> 43:39.916
<i>To hank!</i>
<i>Whoo!</i>

43:39.918 --> 43:42.051
(men cheering)

43:43.654 --> 43:45.321
Congratulations,
buddy.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.323
Thank you, buddy.

43:52.196 --> 43:55.398
Should I take off
my clothes?

44:04.108 --> 44:05.742
And you?

44:09.813 --> 44:13.883
Tonight I need
to reacquaint myself...

44:15.386 --> 44:18.621
...Reacquaint myself
with your body.

44:20.691 --> 44:23.793
I will kiss you
on the mouth.

44:24.128 --> 44:27.230
I will find your breasts
with my lips,

44:27.232 --> 44:30.099
And I will make you climax
this way.

44:30.101 --> 44:32.035
Then my hands will
slide down your body,

44:32.037 --> 44:35.304
And I will spread
your legs.

44:37.207 --> 44:40.309
I will touch
every part of you

44:40.311 --> 44:43.680
And I will put
my mouth on you

44:44.448 --> 44:48.484
And I will make you climax
that way, as well.

44:51.388 --> 44:53.322
Is that clear?

45:03.100 --> 45:06.769
Does this mean
we've resumed our work?

45:07.838 --> 45:10.073
What do you think?

45:15.512 --> 45:18.147
Well, if we have,

45:18.849 --> 45:19.515
Betty told me today

45:19.517 --> 45:24.954
That she thinks
the janitor is stealing
from petty cash.

45:25.756 --> 45:29.025
She noticed $20 missing.

45:29.093 --> 45:30.059
It was there this morning,

45:30.061 --> 45:33.396
And by the end of the day,
it was gone.

45:37.000 --> 45:41.037
And while I
appreciate the effort,

45:41.039 --> 45:43.840
Park plaza isn't cheap.

45:44.908 --> 45:46.375
And so,

45:46.377 --> 45:50.513
If our participation
is to continue,

45:50.515 --> 45:54.450
We're going to
have to find someplace
else cheaper...

45:54.452 --> 45:56.219
Free, even.

45:57.354 --> 46:01.090
Which is unfortunate,
because I will say,

46:01.458 --> 46:03.960
It is nice to be back.

46:08.966 --> 46:10.366
Austin: Showtime!

46:10.368 --> 46:12.201
(men cheering)

46:12.803 --> 46:14.771
Beer. Beer.

46:15.739 --> 46:17.039
Here you go.

46:17.041 --> 46:20.143
(men cheering)
(whistling)

46:21.845 --> 46:24.213
Man: Naughty, naughty.

46:24.215 --> 46:26.816
Nobody's looking.
Man 2: Oh!

46:28.585 --> 46:30.787
Blow a kiss.
There you go.

46:31.555 --> 46:33.489
You know,
I've been thinking...

46:33.491 --> 46:34.657
"holy cow."

46:34.659 --> 46:38.161
Looks a lot like
dr. Langham's girl holly.

46:38.262 --> 46:41.597
But it can't be. Can it?

46:42.199 --> 46:44.567
(men cheering)

46:47.037 --> 46:49.739
Mmm, you smell good.

46:50.374 --> 46:52.074
Is that
l'air du temps?

46:52.076 --> 46:54.977
It's tommy the turtle
bubble bath.

46:55.412 --> 46:57.079
Austin, it's,
it's late.

46:57.081 --> 46:58.848
The kids have school
in the morning.

46:58.850 --> 47:01.551
Oh, I know.
It's just, uh...

47:02.753 --> 47:07.423
Um, please hear me out.
Can you at least do that?

47:12.563 --> 47:15.064
I want us
to get back together.

47:16.099 --> 47:19.035
I've tried
the bachelor life.

47:19.203 --> 47:21.704
I've really
given it my best.

47:21.706 --> 47:23.272
I don't doubt that.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.008
But there's
something, um...

47:26.010 --> 47:28.978
This is going to
sound strange.

47:28.980 --> 47:31.547
But there is something,

47:32.883 --> 47:34.317
Hollow

47:34.852 --> 47:36.185
About it.

47:36.187 --> 47:38.321
Empty, you know.

47:38.956 --> 47:41.190
I feel...
Adrift?

47:41.992 --> 47:44.227
Without an anchor?

47:44.962 --> 47:46.562
Yeah. (chuckles)

47:46.830 --> 47:47.296
Exactly.

47:47.298 --> 47:50.700
See? This is why
we belong together,
because you...

47:50.702 --> 47:52.568
You always just know.

47:52.570 --> 47:53.402
(chuckles)

47:53.404 --> 47:57.306
But it's... It's, uh,
it's more than that.

48:00.944 --> 48:02.712
I love you.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.413
I do, and...

48:04.415 --> 48:05.915
God, I love our kids.

48:05.917 --> 48:08.017
And I realize

48:09.119 --> 48:10.987
That you're it for me.

48:13.156 --> 48:15.224
You're the one.

48:16.560 --> 48:20.196
And what happens
when we get back together

48:20.198 --> 48:22.465
And because you were
then re-anchored,

48:22.467 --> 48:26.302
You immediately go out
and screw everything
that walks again?

48:26.304 --> 48:30.039
I would not do that.
No. I swear I
would be faithful.

48:30.041 --> 48:33.542
Let's say that
were humanly possible.

48:33.544 --> 48:34.577
It still
wouldn't work.

48:34.579 --> 48:38.514
Well, uh,
of course it would work.

48:39.616 --> 48:41.417
It couldn't.

48:42.653 --> 48:45.988
Because some things
cannot be undone.

48:45.990 --> 48:50.960
As much as you want
to un-ring the bell,
it's rung.

48:51.762 --> 48:53.796
And when that happens,

48:53.798 --> 48:55.998
All you can do
is listen.

48:58.201 --> 49:00.836
I've moved on, austin.

49:01.405 --> 49:03.239
I'm gone.

49:13.517 --> 49:15.584
Ah, are you
and mrs. Holden

49:15.586 --> 49:16.619
Enjoying your room,
sir?

49:16.621 --> 49:18.988
Yes. Thank you, elliot.
You, uh,

49:18.990 --> 49:21.090
Seem to have moved up
the ranks.

49:21.092 --> 49:22.491
Night manager
is a position

49:22.493 --> 49:25.294
That comes with
great responsibility,

49:25.296 --> 49:28.030
But I do feel
up to the task.

49:28.032 --> 49:29.832
And I must say,

49:29.834 --> 49:30.333
I'm so glad

49:30.335 --> 49:32.835
You and mrs. Holden
have patched things up.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.203
Elliot, I have
a question.

49:34.205 --> 49:37.840
The hotel has
an on call doctor

49:37.842 --> 49:39.575
If there's any
medical emergencies?

49:39.577 --> 49:42.278
Yes, sir.
That's part of my
new positioning

49:42.280 --> 49:44.513
Is scheduling
the doctors.

49:45.148 --> 49:49.318
Well, I was wondering
if, uh...

49:49.320 --> 49:54.690
If I could fill
one of those on call
positions in return

49:54.692 --> 50:00.096
For your waiving
the charge for
mrs. Holden's and my room.

50:01.164 --> 50:04.667
That might be tricky,
dr. Holden.

50:04.669 --> 50:06.268
Because?

50:06.270 --> 50:08.070
The hotel...

50:08.905 --> 50:12.942
The hotel has to be
up front about
who our guests

50:12.944 --> 50:14.310
Are actually being
seen by,

50:14.312 --> 50:16.379
If you know
what I mean.

50:17.514 --> 50:18.514
I'm not sure how
comfortable they'd feel

50:18.516 --> 50:23.853
If they knew
they were being seen
by a radiologist.

50:24.187 --> 50:26.322
What sort of medical
background do you think

50:26.324 --> 50:28.891
Would reassure
your guests?

50:30.527 --> 50:34.296
More of a general
practitioner.

50:35.665 --> 50:37.833
Uh, a surgeon,

50:39.002 --> 50:40.736
Obstetrician.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.540
My sister,
for example,

50:44.542 --> 50:49.879
She had her
first baby delivered
by a dr. Masters.

50:50.514 --> 50:52.581
If a doctor with
those kind of credentials

50:52.583 --> 50:54.784
Approached me
with such a request,

50:54.786 --> 50:56.152
I would have
a hard time saying no.

50:56.154 --> 50:59.655
So dr. Masters
would be a good choice?

51:01.091 --> 51:05.561
With a doctor
such as dr. Masters,

51:05.729 --> 51:08.864
Something could be
worked out.

51:11.501 --> 51:13.069
Virginia:  <i>Betty?</i>

51:13.703 --> 51:16.472
I need these
test results back
first thing tomorrow.

51:16.474 --> 51:19.842
Oh, before you go,
remember that oddball

51:19.844 --> 51:21.644
That worked for the doc
back at memorial,

51:21.646 --> 51:24.647
The one that was,
you know,
bringing up the rear

51:24.649 --> 51:26.248
With dr. Greathouse?

51:26.250 --> 51:26.816
Oh.

51:26.818 --> 51:29.652
She'd like a moment
of your time.

51:41.198 --> 51:43.432
I'm surprised to
see you here.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.768
(chuckles) I know.

51:46.269 --> 51:48.270
It's funny, isn't it?

51:48.738 --> 51:49.405
What, what made you

51:49.407 --> 51:52.641
Want to become
a participant
in our study?

51:53.543 --> 51:55.444
I don't know.

51:55.879 --> 51:57.379
You don't know?

51:58.882 --> 52:00.049
Well, I...

52:00.051 --> 52:02.451
I was very impressed

52:02.453 --> 52:04.987
With your study when
I was back at memorial

52:04.989 --> 52:07.256
Working for
dr. Masters.

52:07.258 --> 52:10.559
I know that dr. Masters
hated me,

52:10.660 --> 52:12.161
But I could tell
from his work that

52:12.163 --> 52:14.497
He was a very
dedicated doctor.

52:14.499 --> 52:17.833
I'm, I'm sure
that he didn't hate you.

52:18.768 --> 52:20.002
Well...

52:20.004 --> 52:22.972
He hated
dr. Greathouse,

52:22.974 --> 52:25.274
And dr. Greathouse
at the time was my...

52:25.276 --> 52:29.011
Oh, goodness.
That's a long story.
(chuckles)

52:29.013 --> 52:30.846
Anyhow...

52:31.281 --> 52:32.181
I suppose I thought
that I could

52:32.183 --> 52:34.450
Learn something
from your study,

52:34.784 --> 52:37.486
Learn something
about the human body.

52:37.488 --> 52:39.388
About your body?

52:39.823 --> 52:43.526
Which doesn't work
very well down there.

52:43.528 --> 52:47.897
You said that
you can't have
intercourse.

52:47.899 --> 52:48.597
In fact,

52:48.599 --> 52:51.767
Nothing can penetrate
the vaginal opening,

52:51.769 --> 52:54.503
Because it's closed.

52:55.038 --> 52:56.805
Um, barbara, I thought

52:56.807 --> 53:00.342
That you and
dr. Greathouse,

53:00.410 --> 53:03.546
There was a sexual...
We did everything.

53:03.947 --> 53:05.481
Just...

53:05.483 --> 53:09.118
Not the normal way,
because I couldn't.

53:11.421 --> 53:14.690
As I was saying,
it's a long story.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.158
I see.

53:16.160 --> 53:19.595
Well, there are things
that we can discuss

53:19.597 --> 53:21.430
About your condition,

53:21.432 --> 53:23.065
But I'm afraid
in terms of your

53:23.067 --> 53:25.568
Participating
in the study,

53:25.769 --> 53:28.604
This type of
dysfunction...

53:28.606 --> 53:30.105
Please don't.

53:30.107 --> 53:31.774
Don't?

53:33.543 --> 53:36.345
Don't feel bad
about rejecting me.

53:36.880 --> 53:38.147
It's life.

53:38.149 --> 53:41.083
Sometimes the
answer's just no.

53:41.785 --> 53:44.253
In fact, it usually is.

53:47.657 --> 53:50.025
(upbeat music playing)

53:54.331 --> 53:55.598
Virginia: I realized
as she left,

53:55.600 --> 53:57.967
There goes an entire
sexual history

53:57.969 --> 53:58.901
That we will never
know about

53:58.903 --> 54:01.370
Because she's
technically ineligible
for the study.

54:01.372 --> 54:03.539
But that's true
of everybody we reject.

54:03.541 --> 54:05.040
You're saying
we shouldn't
be rejecting.

54:05.042 --> 54:08.210
I'm saying
I think people see
the doctor

54:08.212 --> 54:11.914
In front of your name
and they hope that
you can help.

54:12.015 --> 54:13.949
You two,
what's it gonna take

54:13.951 --> 54:15.484
To get you to take
a day off?

54:15.486 --> 54:17.353
So sorry, libby.
You are absolutely right.

54:17.355 --> 54:20.155
There is lots of
work to be done
in the kitchen.

54:20.157 --> 54:22.658
Bill's working, too.

54:23.593 --> 54:25.261
(sighs)

54:27.831 --> 54:28.964
Cake still isn't frosted.

54:28.966 --> 54:33.002
Huh. Well,
that happens to be
my specialty.

54:33.637 --> 54:36.972
Libby: So, the lefley's
offered us their lake house.

54:36.974 --> 54:38.440
It's two hours away.

54:38.442 --> 54:40.743
Oh, that could be fun.

54:42.412 --> 54:44.680
I thought you quit.

54:45.482 --> 54:46.949
I did.

54:47.817 --> 54:50.252
No, I really did quit.

54:52.022 --> 54:53.922
You know what'd be
really fun?

54:53.924 --> 54:55.257
Hmm?

54:55.558 --> 54:57.259
Paris.

54:57.261 --> 55:00.329
I've always wanted to
go to paris

55:00.664 --> 55:02.665
And morocco.

55:03.099 --> 55:05.167
I am dying to go

55:05.169 --> 55:06.502
Anywhere.

55:06.504 --> 55:10.039
But the lake house
is a good start,
and you know what?

55:10.041 --> 55:11.206
You should go with us.

55:11.208 --> 55:12.908
(chuckling) lib!

55:12.910 --> 55:14.510
No, that is
your vacation.

55:14.512 --> 55:16.912
Yours and bill's
to have alone.

55:16.914 --> 55:19.048
Well, the children
are coming, of course.

55:19.050 --> 55:22.318
And you, you could
bring your kids.

55:23.153 --> 55:24.887
Honestly, it would be...

55:24.889 --> 55:26.689
It would be nicer
if you were there.

55:26.691 --> 55:29.358
Easier and I
would like that.

55:29.626 --> 55:32.227
(chuckles)
it's much more pleasant
to be around bill

55:32.229 --> 55:33.962
When you're around.

55:42.138 --> 55:44.907
<i>We need a few more</i>
<i>with cheese.</i>

55:52.515 --> 55:54.650
I invited her.

56:02.559 --> 56:04.293
I'll be inside.

56:13.570 --> 56:16.605
It's a perfect
celebration.

56:18.041 --> 56:21.276
It means a lot to libby
to have you here.

56:24.280 --> 56:28.884
And this time,
when I asked you to
stay away, you did.

56:30.019 --> 56:32.121
Believe me, I...

56:32.123 --> 56:33.956
I looked closely.

56:33.958 --> 56:36.592
I've learned
my lesson.

56:37.861 --> 56:39.928
I wouldn't say that.

56:39.930 --> 56:42.231
20 percent bump
in revenue?

56:43.600 --> 56:44.833
Due to an increase in

56:44.835 --> 56:47.603
Fertility patients
and fees?

56:48.171 --> 56:50.906
What I'm not gonna look
too closely at,

56:50.908 --> 56:54.977
Is how you and libby
and betty managed to
make that money,

56:54.979 --> 56:59.281
Which I said I didn't want,
land in my pocket anyhow.

57:00.917 --> 57:03.752
Because if I really
looked at that,

57:03.754 --> 57:07.156
We'd be back at square one,
wouldn't we?

57:08.691 --> 57:11.093
Ruptured again.

57:12.162 --> 57:15.397
And the thought
of that just...

57:16.699 --> 57:19.935
Frankly,
it just leaves me tired.

57:22.038 --> 57:23.772
Sometimes exhaustion

57:23.774 --> 57:26.208
Is the first step forward.

57:28.545 --> 57:30.646
I had to help you, son.

57:30.648 --> 57:34.116
I couldn't not.
Not again.

57:36.119 --> 57:39.822
But there's another
reason that money

57:41.991 --> 57:44.660
Didn't find
its way to you.

57:44.727 --> 57:47.095
It's because
I'm proud of you.

57:47.097 --> 57:51.767
Everything
you've accomplished,
all on your own,

57:51.935 --> 57:54.069
In spite of everything.

57:54.071 --> 57:57.439
I am so very proud
of my son.

58:05.882 --> 58:08.283
(camera shutter clicks)
