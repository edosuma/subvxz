WEBVTT

00:02.133 --> 00:03.204
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.204 --> 00:05.036
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:05.036 --> 00:07.038
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:07.038 --> 00:10.111
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.582
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.582 --> 00:15.286
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.286 --> 00:16.617
WRAPPED MY CAR AROUND
THE UTILITY POLE,

00:16.617 --> 00:18.289
AND I BROKE SARA'S SPINE.

00:18.289 --> 00:19.620
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO HER
SINCE THAT NIGHT.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.422
(Aiden) YOUR HUSBAND
HAD ME INVESTIGATE

00:21.422 --> 00:22.453
THE CAUSE OF THE WRECK.

00:22.453 --> 00:23.654
IT WAS ONE OF YOUR CHILDREN.

00:23.654 --> 00:26.457
SO IT WAS PATRICK.
VICTORIA WILL COVER IT UP.

00:26.457 --> 00:28.229
IT WAS ME, I SWEAR!
I'LL CONFESS.

00:28.229 --> 00:30.601
(Conrad) YOU'RE MY GIRL,
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

00:30.601 --> 00:33.064
YOU CAME BACK HERE TO HELP.
YOU'RE EVERYTHING TO ME.

00:34.065 --> 00:35.566
I CAN'T MARRY YOU, EMILY.

00:35.566 --> 00:39.270
THE ONLY WAY TO WIN DANIEL BACK
IS SHARE A PIECE OF YOURSELF.

00:39.270 --> 00:41.772
I WANT NOTHING MORE
THAN TO STAND BESIDE YOU

00:41.772 --> 00:43.274
ON OUR WEDDING DAY.

00:43.274 --> 00:44.815
AND I WANT THAT, TOO.

00:47.118 --> 00:49.750
(sea birds calling)

00:49.750 --> 00:54.725
(Emily) LOVE BUILT ON LIES
 IS AN ARDUOUS ENDEAVOR.

00:54.725 --> 00:58.489
FOR WHEREVER PASSION
 AND TREACHERY MEET,

00:58.489 --> 01:01.292
DISSOLUTION BEGINS.

01:01.292 --> 01:03.294
HEY, COME BACK TO BED.

01:03.294 --> 01:04.694
UH, AFTER MY SWIM.

01:04.694 --> 01:07.268
WATCH OUT FOR SHARKS, OKAY?

01:07.268 --> 01:11.202
STILL, WE FIGHT TO HOLD
 OUR GROUND IN THE EMPTINESS...

01:11.202 --> 01:12.343
ALWAYS.

01:14.645 --> 01:19.210
IGNORING THE FACT
 THAT EVERY RELATIONSHIP...

01:19.210 --> 01:22.313
EVEN THE ONES WE CHERISH...

01:22.313 --> 01:23.584
INEVITABLY DIES.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.416
(door closes in distance)

01:28.689 --> 01:30.191
NOLAN?

01:35.566 --> 01:38.599
(breathing heavily) NOLAN!

01:43.234 --> 01:44.635
NOLAN?

01:50.241 --> 01:51.712
NOLAN?
 AAH!

01:51.712 --> 01:54.715
YOU'RE OKAY.
 WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING
BARGING IN HERE?

01:54.715 --> 01:56.717
DIDN'T YOU HEAR ME
SCREAMING FOR YOU?

01:56.717 --> 01:59.119
I WAS DOING
MY MORNING HYDROTHERAPY.

01:59.119 --> 02:01.121
I JUST SAW PATRICK LEAVING.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN TROUBLE.

02:01.121 --> 02:05.756
NO, THAT... COULDN'T BE
FURTHER FROM THE TRUTH.

02:05.756 --> 02:08.859
LAST NIGHT WAS
OUR FIRST NIGHT TOGETHER.

02:08.859 --> 02:11.502
THAT'S GOOD THAT IT
JUST STARTED,

02:11.502 --> 02:13.604
'CAUSE IT HAS TO END.

02:13.604 --> 02:16.467
(scoffs) BECAUSE HE TRIED TO RID
THE WORLD OF CONRAD GRAYSON?

02:16.467 --> 02:19.270
VISIONS OF THAT GUY'S DEMISE
DANCE IN YOUR HEAD 24/7.

02:19.270 --> 02:21.242
AN INNOCENT MAN DIED
INSTEAD.

02:21.242 --> 02:24.275
PATRICK IS A CRIMINAL.
 YEAH, NOT THE PATRICK I KNOW.

02:24.275 --> 02:26.317
YOU DON'T KNOW HIM
WELL ENOUGH TO SAY THAT.
 WAIT, WAIT. I'M SORRY.

02:26.317 --> 02:28.279
ARE YOU TELLING ME
HOW TO FEEL?

02:28.279 --> 02:29.750
I AM TELLING YOU
TO BE RATIONAL.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.753
WHAT DO YOU EVEN SEE
IN THIS GUY?

02:32.753 --> 02:35.456
SOMEONE WHO WANTS TO FIT IN HERE
BUT DOESN'T.

02:35.456 --> 02:37.488
EM, SOMEONE LIKE ME.

02:37.488 --> 02:39.230
WE KEPT "US" A SECRET
FOR A REASON.

02:39.230 --> 02:40.631
PATRICK AND I
DIDN'T WANNA GET

02:40.631 --> 02:45.336
CAUGHT UP IN THE CROSSFIRE
BETWEEN YOU AND VICTORIA.

02:45.336 --> 02:47.638
SO WHAT HAPPENS NOW?

02:47.638 --> 02:49.340
IS HE YOUR NEXT TAKEDOWN?

02:49.340 --> 02:51.272
I HAVEN'T DECIDED.

02:52.803 --> 02:55.546
I WISH THINGS
WERE DIFFERENT, NOLAN.

02:57.478 --> 03:00.551
(ship horn blows in distance)

03:00.551 --> 03:02.283
♪♪♪

03:02.283 --> 03:04.915
YOU HAVE THE HANDWRITING
OF A MAIL BOMBER.

03:04.915 --> 03:07.918
(sighs) WE CAN GO BACK
TO PAPER MENUS.

03:07.918 --> 03:11.322
THOSE WORKED JUST FINE
FOR 35 YEARS.

03:11.322 --> 03:13.224
DON'T YOU WANT
A HIP AND HAPPENING SPOT

03:13.224 --> 03:15.426
WHERE A CERTAIN PARISIAN
MAGAZINE EDITOR

03:15.426 --> 03:16.967
WILL FEEL AT HOME?

03:16.967 --> 03:19.199
I THINK MARGAUX
ALREADY DOES.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.901
YOU DID A REALLY GREAT JOB
WITH THE REMODEL.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.374
YEAH, THERE'S JUST ONE THING
MISSING--

03:23.374 --> 03:26.577
A BALD LITTLE MAN WHO'S PRONE
TO SPIT-UP AND DIAPER RASH.

03:26.577 --> 03:28.279
YEAH.

03:28.279 --> 03:31.612
WELL...
I MISS CARL, TOO,

03:31.612 --> 03:33.684
AND SO DOES MY GRANDMA
IN JERSEY.

03:33.684 --> 03:34.885
WHEN'S HE COMING BACK?

03:34.885 --> 03:36.987
AFTER DANIEL
AND EMILY'S WEDDING.

03:36.987 --> 03:39.320
IT'S THE LAST DISTRACTION
BEFORE THE SEASON DIES DOWN,

03:39.320 --> 03:41.322
AND... MY LIFE STARTS AGAIN.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.823
IF I HAD MY WISH,

03:42.823 --> 03:45.256
THAT DISTRACTION
WOULD BE OVER WITH NOW.

03:46.357 --> 03:47.698
ANYWAY, I'M OUT.

03:47.698 --> 03:50.461
MY MOTHER HAS SUMMONED
THE ENTIRE FAMILY TO BREAKFAST

03:50.461 --> 03:52.563
TO DISCUSS
THE IMPENDING NUPTIALS.

03:52.563 --> 03:55.466
I AM SO LOOKING FORWARD
TO SEEING MY FATHER.

03:55.466 --> 03:56.967
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.570
ACTUALLY, WHILE I DETEST HIM
MORE THAN EVER,

03:59.570 --> 04:02.242
HE AND I HAVE HAD
A RECONCILIATION OF SORTS.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.315
(sighs)

04:04.315 --> 04:06.016
IT'S FOR A GOOD REASON.
 THERE'S NO GOOD REASON.

04:06.016 --> 04:07.948
HOW DID HE MANIPULATE YOU?
 HE DIDN'T.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.781
I MANIPULATED HIM,
AND I DID IT TO PROTECT YOU.

04:10.781 --> 04:12.953
(cell phone rings)

04:12.953 --> 04:14.325
(cell phone beeps)
 HEY.

04:14.325 --> 04:16.286
(Jack) You know that
Charlotte lied to Conrad

04:16.286 --> 04:17.928
AND CONFESSED TO SABOTAGING
HIS BRAKES?

04:17.928 --> 04:20.630
(sighs) THAT IS A NEW LOW
FOR VICTORIA. JACK,

04:20.630 --> 04:21.632
Patrick did it.

04:21.632 --> 04:22.893
IF THAT'S THE CASE,

04:22.893 --> 04:24.795
THEN WHAT'S TO STOP HIM
FROM GETTING RID OF HER

04:24.795 --> 04:26.797
TO KEEP THE TRUTH
FROM EVER COMING OUT?

04:26.797 --> 04:28.999
I'LL BE WATCHING HIM. I WOULD
NEVER LET ANYTHING HAPPEN

04:28.999 --> 04:30.371
to Charlotte.
You know that.

04:30.371 --> 04:31.402
I WANT HIM GONE!

04:31.402 --> 04:33.344
JACK, JUST STAY OUT OF IT.

04:33.344 --> 04:34.875
THE LAST TIME YOU DIDN'T
LOOP ME IN,

04:34.875 --> 04:35.976
I HAD TO SEND MY SON AWAY

04:35.976 --> 04:37.608
'CAUSE I THOUGHT
HE MIGHT BE IN DANGER.

04:37.608 --> 04:39.310
(Daniel in distance)
HUSTLE UP! WE'RE LATE!

04:39.310 --> 04:42.012
You're forcing people to stumble
around in the dark, Emily.

04:42.012 --> 04:44.385
THAT'S HOW PEOPLE
GET HURT.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.917
(classical music playing)

04:46.917 --> 04:49.460
YOU'RE GOOD WITH A KNIFE.

04:49.460 --> 04:52.292
YEAH, WELL, I'VE SLAVED AWAY
IN ENOUGH RESTAURANTS.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.024
WELL, THEN YOU'RE INVITED
TO ONE

04:54.024 --> 04:56.066
THAT'LL TREAT YOU
LIKE A KING.

04:56.066 --> 04:58.529
THE SPRUCED UP STOWAWAY
PREMIERES TOMORROW,

04:58.529 --> 04:59.770
AND DRINKS ARE ON ME.

04:59.770 --> 05:02.573
WELL, THANK YOU, CHARLOTTE.
I APPRECIATE THAT.

05:02.573 --> 05:03.774
I HAVE TO SEE HOW I FEEL,
THOUGH.

05:03.774 --> 05:05.035
I'M COMING OFF
A PRETTY LATE NIGHT.

05:05.035 --> 05:07.638
SO LATE,
YOU DIDN'T COME HOME.

05:07.638 --> 05:09.039
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

05:09.039 --> 05:11.081
YEAH, SURE.

05:11.081 --> 05:13.614
EXCUSE ME.

05:15.045 --> 05:16.316
YEAH?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.819
WE HAVE PRESSING MATTERS
TO DISCUSS.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.020
(speaking indistinctly)

05:20.020 --> 05:22.353
GO TO THE GALLERY,
AND I'LL ARRIVE SHORTLY.

05:22.353 --> 05:23.354
ALL RIGHT?

05:23.354 --> 05:25.356
OKAY.

05:25.356 --> 05:28.028
(Conrad) WE HAVE THE WINDOWS
IN THE FOREGROUND HERE.

05:28.028 --> 05:30.861
UM, SO...

05:30.861 --> 05:32.863
UH... (speaks indistinctly)
 YOU CAN SEE THE TONE...

05:32.863 --> 05:34.835
(Conrad chuckles) THANK YOU--
OF THE ARCHITECTURE,

05:34.835 --> 05:37.968
AND THE THING I WANNA
SHOW YOU MOST OF ALL...

05:37.968 --> 05:39.840
PERVERSE AS THAT DISPLAY
MAY BE,

05:39.840 --> 05:42.543
WE'RE HERE TO DISCUSS
THE SACRED BOND OF MARRIAGE.

05:42.543 --> 05:46.517
CALL IT MOTHERLY CONCERN,
BUT I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICE

05:46.517 --> 05:48.919
THE TENSION BETWEEN
THE FUTURE BRIDE AND GROOM.

05:48.919 --> 05:52.052
SO BEFORE THINGS PROGRESS
TO THE POINT OF NO RETURN,

05:52.052 --> 05:54.955
LET ME ASSURE YOU, THERE IS
NO SHAME IN HITTING PAUSE

05:54.955 --> 05:56.387
WHILE YOU SORT THINGS OUT.

05:56.387 --> 05:59.930
WELL, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY,
VICTORIA.

05:59.930 --> 06:01.792
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

06:01.792 --> 06:04.034
DANIEL AND I HAVE DECIDED
ON OUR HONEYMOON--

06:04.034 --> 06:07.037
A WEEKEND CRUISE TO NANTUCKET
FOR IMMEDIATE FAMILY.

06:07.037 --> 06:08.599
(Emily chuckles)
 YEAH, IT'S FULL STEAM AHEAD.

06:08.599 --> 06:10.040
WE TALKED LAST NIGHT,
AND...

06:10.040 --> 06:11.572
WE COULDN'T BE MORE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.404
A FAMILY HONEYMOON.

06:13.404 --> 06:15.446
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE WAY
TO DECOMPRESS

06:15.446 --> 06:17.107
AFTER THE INSANITY
OF THE WEDDING.

06:17.107 --> 06:18.649
WON'T IT JUST? HMM.

06:18.649 --> 06:21.812
THE YACHT LEAVES FROM HERE
RIGHT AFTER THE RECEPTION.

06:21.812 --> 06:23.083
HONEY, YOU HAVE
A LITTLE SOMETHING.
 HMM?

06:23.083 --> 06:24.084
WHAT? WHAT?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.156
LET ME GET IT. (chuckles)

06:26.156 --> 06:29.920
DANIEL, COULD YOU CARVE OUT
SOME TIME FOR ME TODAY?

06:29.920 --> 06:31.492
MM. (sips)
IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.924
I'M COVERING FOR MARGAUX
'CAUSE SHE'S IN L.A.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.926
PLEASE? I NEED
YOUR BUSINESS SAVVY.

06:35.926 --> 06:37.027
I WANNA DO MY PART
TO BOOST THE BOTTOM LINE

06:37.027 --> 06:38.999
OF THE STOWAWAY.

06:38.999 --> 06:42.503
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
SUCH AN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT.
 (cup clatters)

06:42.503 --> 06:43.704
I'LL MOVE SOME MEETINGS.

06:43.704 --> 06:46.006
(Conrad) GOOD MORNING, KITTEN.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.178
(kisses) IT'S LOVELY TO HAVE YOU
BACK IN THE LITTER.

06:48.178 --> 06:50.010
LOVELY TO BE HERE, DADDY.

06:50.010 --> 06:53.113
WON'T YOUR MISTRESS
BE JOINING US, CONRAD?

06:53.113 --> 06:55.015
I'M SURE WE COULD RUSTLE UP
A POP-TART.

06:55.015 --> 06:57.047
SHE'S NOT MY MISTRESS.

06:57.047 --> 06:59.950
MORGAN IS
A REAL ESTATE SPECIALIST.

06:59.950 --> 07:02.022
AND WHAT WILL YOU BE PURCHASING?
A PLACE IN HELL?

07:02.022 --> 07:03.654
WHY, I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT,

07:03.654 --> 07:06.727
BUT I'M ACTUALLY ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THAT TRANSACTION.

07:06.727 --> 07:09.730
GRAYSON MANOR HAS BEEN SOLD.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.201
MOST OF OUR OTHER ASSETS
HAVE BEEN LIQUIDATED

07:11.201 --> 07:14.004
TO KEEP US AFLOAT,
BUT THIS ESTATE

07:14.004 --> 07:15.666
IS STILL DRIVING US
INTO THE RED.

07:15.666 --> 07:18.509
MORGAN PRODUCED
AN ALL-CASH BUYER--

07:18.509 --> 07:21.672
A SAUDI PRINCE, NO LESS,
WITH AN OFFER THAT I--

07:21.672 --> 07:23.614
I JUST COULDN'T REFUSE.
(laughs)

07:23.614 --> 07:25.676
STOP GLOATING,
YOU SPITEFUL BEAST.

07:25.676 --> 07:27.077
YOU KNOW THIS HOME
IS MY HAVEN.

07:27.077 --> 07:28.779
OH, WELL, HERE I THOUGHT

07:28.779 --> 07:31.151
YOUR HAVEN WAS
YOUR ILLEGITIMATE SON

07:31.151 --> 07:33.784
AND THAT ADORABLE LITTLE GALLERY
YOU SHARE.

07:37.628 --> 07:41.732
AT THE RISK OF SOUNDING
LIKE A NEUROTIC BRIDE,

07:41.732 --> 07:43.193
WASN'T THIS HOUSE SUPPOSED
TO BE COMMAND CENTRAL

07:43.193 --> 07:44.695
FOR THE WEDDING?

07:44.695 --> 07:47.137
OH, IT'S OKAY, BABE.
WE'LL FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

07:47.137 --> 07:50.070
OR MAYBE WE COULD BUY IT.

07:50.070 --> 07:53.844
IT WOULD BE AN HONOR TO KEEP
GRAYSON MANOR IN THE FAMILY.

07:53.844 --> 07:57.077
MAGNANIMOUS OFFER,
BUT I'M AFRAID THE DEAL'S DONE.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.712
HOW LONG DO WE HAVE?
 ESCROW CLOSES IN THREE WEEKS.

08:01.712 --> 08:03.013
WELL, THE WEDDING'S IN FIVE.

08:03.013 --> 08:04.785
MY PLAN DEPENDS
ON THEM STAYING HERE,

08:04.785 --> 08:06.016
AND I NEED YOU HERE, TOO.

08:06.016 --> 08:08.158
HAVING A MAN ON THE INSIDE
HAS BEEN INVALUABLE.

08:09.760 --> 08:12.122
WHAT?

08:12.122 --> 08:13.524
WELL, WE SHARE ONE KISS
LAST NIGHT,

08:13.524 --> 08:15.766
AND NOW YOU'RE
DOLING OUT COMPLIMENTS.

08:15.766 --> 08:18.068
(lowered voice)
NOT HERE, AIDEN.
 (sighs)

08:18.068 --> 08:20.070
FINE, BUT WE'RE
CONTINUING THIS LATER.

08:20.070 --> 08:23.073
SO WHO DO WE TAKE OUT
OF THE EQUATION FIRST?

08:23.073 --> 08:25.275
THE REAL ESTATE AGENT?
 SHE ALREADY CLOSED THE DEAL.

08:25.275 --> 08:27.237
IS THE BUYER VULNERABLE?
 HE'S A SAUDI ROYAL

08:27.237 --> 08:29.209
PAYING CASH, SO NO.

08:31.942 --> 08:33.744
OUR ONLY OPTION...

08:33.744 --> 08:36.986
IS TO TAKE DOWN
THE HOUSE ITSELF.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.535
AND, UH, NOLAN,
THAT IS CALL NUMBER THREE.

08:55.535 --> 08:58.238
IF IT GETS TO FOUR,
I'M CALLING THE COPS. (sighs)

08:58.238 --> 08:59.770
(cell phone beeps)

09:04.544 --> 09:05.916
WHAT IS IT?

09:05.916 --> 09:09.079
CONRAD SOLD
MY HAMPTONS ESTATE.

09:11.021 --> 09:13.684
DID IT JUST TO HURT YOU,
I BET.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.255
FOR THE LAST TIME.

09:15.255 --> 09:20.060
FROM NOW ON,
I VOW TO BE FREE OF HIM.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.692
AND HOW CAN I HELP?

09:21.692 --> 09:23.133
ALLOW ME TO PUT
THE GALLERY AND ITS CONTENTS

09:23.133 --> 09:24.595
IN YOUR NAME.

09:24.595 --> 09:26.867
THAT WAY, HE CAN NEVER PROFIT
FROM OUR HARD WORK.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.769
YOU TRUST ME WITH THIS?

09:28.769 --> 09:29.970
MY ENTIRE FUTURE

09:29.970 --> 09:32.042
IS NOW
IN YOUR RELIABLE HANDS.

09:32.042 --> 09:33.573
AND I'LL DO EVERYTHING
I CAN TO PROTECT IT.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.176
I KNOW YOU WILL, PATRICK.

09:36.176 --> 09:39.009
(exhales)

09:39.009 --> 09:42.112
JUST AS I KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

09:45.055 --> 09:47.618
YOU TRIED TO TAKE
CONRAD'S LIFE.

09:47.618 --> 09:49.990
YOU DON'T NEED TO DENY IT.

09:51.321 --> 09:55.095
THAT BASTARD HUMILIATES YOU
EVERY CHANCE HE GETS.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.366
HE TREATS YOU WITH NOTHING
BUT HATE.

09:56.366 --> 09:58.228
I COULDN'T STAND BY
AND LET HIM GET AWAY WITH IT.

09:58.228 --> 10:00.871
I'M NOT GONNA APOLOGIZE
FOR WANTING HIM DEAD.

10:00.871 --> 10:02.602
BUT YOU GOTTA BELIEVE ME.
I...

10:02.602 --> 10:04.875
I NEVER MEANT FOR
AN INNOCENT MAN TO DIE.

10:04.875 --> 10:08.038
CONRAD PUT FATHER PAUL
IN THAT CAR, NOT YOU.

10:08.038 --> 10:11.041
YOU TRIED TO SPARE ME
FROM A MONSTER.

10:11.041 --> 10:13.914
IT WAS AN ACT
OF PURE SELFLESSNESS,

10:13.914 --> 10:16.717
AND ONE I WILL
ALWAYS CHERISH.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.318
SO WHAT NOW?
DOES CONRAD KNOW?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.321
NO. HE NEVER WILL.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.655
I MADE SURE OF THAT.
YOU'RE SAFE.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.062
I LOVE YOU, MOM.

10:35.666 --> 10:38.809
YOU NEVER CALLED ME THAT
BEFORE.

10:38.809 --> 10:40.370
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW I'D BE
GIVING OUT BUSINESS ADVICE

10:40.370 --> 10:43.043
WHILE YOU TRIED ON SHOES
ALL MORNING.

10:43.043 --> 10:44.214
I'M A MULTITASKER.

10:44.214 --> 10:46.016
(chuckles) YEAH?
AND WHAT'S YOUR TASK HERE?

10:46.016 --> 10:47.377
I'M SURPRISING JACK
WITH A CAKE

10:47.377 --> 10:48.979
TO CELEBRATE
THE BAR'S MAKEOVER.

10:48.979 --> 10:50.981
ACTUALLY, COULD YOU POP IN
AND GRAB IT

10:50.981 --> 10:53.123
WHILE I RUN ACROSS THE STREET
AND GET A CARD?

10:53.123 --> 10:54.254
THE ORDER'S UNDER "STOWAWAY."

10:54.254 --> 10:56.126
ALL RIGHT, WELL, HURRY UP,
OKAY?

10:56.126 --> 10:57.988
(door bells jingle)

10:57.988 --> 11:00.791
(indistinct conversations)

11:00.791 --> 11:03.293
HI. PICKING UP SOMETHING
FOR THE STOWAWAY?

11:08.038 --> 11:09.099
SARA.

11:09.099 --> 11:11.341
HUH.

11:11.341 --> 11:13.103
I DIDN'T EXPECT
TO SEE YOU--

11:13.103 --> 11:15.445
WALKING?

11:15.445 --> 11:16.777
YEAH, THE, UH, RANDOM TIME

11:16.777 --> 11:17.808
YOU DROPPED INTO
INTO THE REHAB FACILITY,

11:17.808 --> 11:20.050
I HADN'T QUITE
MASTERED IT YET.

11:20.050 --> 11:21.882
(sighs)

11:21.882 --> 11:24.354
WELL, YOU'VE MADE, UH,
YOU'VE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS.

11:24.354 --> 11:26.286
(thud)
 NO HELP FROM YOU.

11:26.286 --> 11:28.759
LISTEN, I WANTED TO BE THERE,
OKAY? YOU WEREN'T INTERESTED.

11:28.759 --> 11:30.020
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT MORAL SUPPORT.

11:30.020 --> 11:31.261
I'M TALKING ABOUT
BEING ABLE TO PAY

11:31.261 --> 11:33.764
FOR THE MEDICAL TREATMENT
I STILL NEED.

11:33.764 --> 11:35.225
EVERYTHING'S COVERED
BY THE SETTLEMENT.

11:35.225 --> 11:37.697
NOT QUITE. YOUR MOMMY AND DADDY
SCREWED ME IN THE FINE PRINT,

11:37.697 --> 11:39.469
SO NOW I GOTTA WORK
60 HOURS A WEEK

11:39.469 --> 11:42.232
TO AFFORD A CRAPPY H.M.O.

11:42.232 --> 11:44.474
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

11:44.474 --> 11:48.779
YEAH, WELL,
YOU'VE BEEN BUSY.

11:48.779 --> 11:50.210
I SAW YOUR, UH,
YOUR PUBLISHER'S PROFILE

11:50.210 --> 11:52.282
IN YOUR MAGAZINE.

11:52.282 --> 11:55.715
I LOVE HOW I AM THE PROBLEM
YOU HAD TO OVERCOME

11:55.715 --> 11:57.317
ON YOUR ROAD TO GREATNESS.

11:59.189 --> 12:00.320
(Charlotte) SARA?
 (door closes, bells jingle)

12:00.320 --> 12:02.753
(sighs) COME ON, CHARLOTTE.
LET'S GO.

12:02.753 --> 12:04.454
YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOU FOOLED
YOUR READERS INTO THINKING

12:04.454 --> 12:05.926
YOU'VE GROWN UP, DANNY,

12:05.926 --> 12:09.029
BUT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE
THE CLUELESS FRAT BOY WHO WAS

12:09.029 --> 12:11.061
"ALL GOOD TO DRIVE"
AFTER FIVE DRINKS,

12:11.061 --> 12:12.332
AND YOU CRASHED YOUR CAR,

12:12.332 --> 12:17.007
YOU CRUSHED MY SPINE,
AND YOU NEVER LOOKED BACK!

12:17.007 --> 12:19.369
(breathing heavily)

12:19.369 --> 12:21.311
(lowered voice)
COME ON, LET'S GO.
 (door bells jingle)

12:32.252 --> 12:33.984
(indistinct conversations
in distance)

12:44.995 --> 12:48.338
(closes drawer)

12:53.904 --> 12:57.547
(waves crashing,
sea birds calling)

12:57.547 --> 12:59.810
YOU DIDN'T RETURN
ANY OF MY CALLS.

12:59.810 --> 13:01.081
GOT A LITTLE WORRIED.

13:01.081 --> 13:04.054
SWEET TO CHECK ON ME.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.456
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO.

13:06.456 --> 13:08.318
WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
I'M--I'M SELFISH.

13:08.318 --> 13:11.021
I JUST DIDN'T
WANNA BE ALONE.

13:11.021 --> 13:14.424
TRUTH IS... NEITHER DO I.

13:23.874 --> 13:25.475
WHAT'S GOING ON?

13:25.475 --> 13:31.141
LET'S JUST SAY I DID
SOMETHING IMPULSIVE AND...

13:31.141 --> 13:33.543
SO STUPID.
 PATRICK...

13:37.888 --> 13:39.950
WE STARTED SOMETHING GREAT.

13:41.251 --> 13:43.854
SOMETHING
THAT'S MOVING FASTER

13:43.854 --> 13:47.027
THAN ANYTHING
I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED WITH...

13:48.899 --> 13:50.160
A-ANYONE ELSE.

13:50.160 --> 13:54.504
BUT LIFE HAS GOTTEN
SUDDENLY COMPLICATED.

13:54.504 --> 13:59.069
LOOK, IF WE HAD MET
IN ANOTHER PLACE,

13:59.069 --> 14:03.173
IN ANOTHER SUMMER,
OR--OR HAD DIFFERENT FRIENDS,

14:03.173 --> 14:05.045
DIFFERENT MOTHERS...

14:05.045 --> 14:06.276
NOLAN, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS, RIGHT?

14:06.276 --> 14:07.417
WE AGREED WE WEREN'T
GONNA LET

14:07.417 --> 14:09.019
VICTORIA AND EMILY
COME BETWEEN US.

14:09.019 --> 14:11.481
TURNS OUT IT'S NOT
THAT EASY.

14:11.481 --> 14:13.483
THAT'S NOT AN ANSWER...
NOLAN.

14:13.483 --> 14:16.126
IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ME, AT LEAST.

14:16.126 --> 14:18.358
I WANNA BE WITH YOU.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.460
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THEY GET A VOTE.

14:22.092 --> 14:23.463
THEY SHOULDN'T.

14:25.365 --> 14:27.337
THEN WHAT'S STANDING
IN OUR WAY?

14:46.286 --> 14:48.018
(lid thuds)

14:48.018 --> 14:50.590
WELL, AT LEAST IT'S STILL
IN ONE PIECE.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.362
ARE YOU?

14:52.362 --> 14:54.194
I GUESS.

14:56.466 --> 14:58.969
ONE THING'S CERTAIN.
SHE HATES ME.

14:58.969 --> 15:02.032
DANIEL, THAT WAS A SHOCK
TO BOTH OF YOU.

15:02.032 --> 15:04.904
EMOTIONS WERE RUNNING HIGH.
SARA WAS ANGRY.

15:04.904 --> 15:06.036
AH, SHE WAS RIGHT.

15:06.036 --> 15:07.207
I AM CLUELESS.

15:07.207 --> 15:08.979
I CREATED A NEW LIFE
FOR MYSELF WITH EMILY

15:08.979 --> 15:11.441
AND... PUT HER
OUT OF MY MIND COMPLETELY.

15:11.441 --> 15:12.983
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:12.983 --> 15:14.384
IF YOU DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HER,

15:14.384 --> 15:16.286
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TRIED TO
REACH OUT TO HER TWO YEARS AGO.

15:16.286 --> 15:17.988
OH, I SHOULD'VE TRIED HARDER.

15:17.988 --> 15:20.620
CHARLOTTE, SHE'S WORKING
IN A BAKERY TO PAY

15:20.620 --> 15:23.293
FOR MEDICAL BILLS THAT ARE
MY RESPONSIBILITY.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.458
DAD KEEPS OUR LEGAL PAPERS
IN THE CITY.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.160
I'M GONNA DIG UP
THAT SETTLEMENT

15:30.160 --> 15:34.004
AND DO WHAT I SHOULD'VE DONE
A LONG TIME AGO--READ IT.

15:35.365 --> 15:36.936
(door closes)

15:43.013 --> 15:45.015
(buttons click)

15:45.015 --> 15:46.546
(beep)

15:46.546 --> 15:48.218
(line rings, click)
 (woman) Mill's Family Bakery.

15:48.218 --> 15:51.121
HELLO? MAY I SPEAK
TO THE MANAGER, PLEASE?

15:51.121 --> 15:54.124
Speaking.
 OH, GREAT. I NEED TO REPORT
AN EMPLOYEE

15:54.124 --> 15:57.287
WHO WAS INEXCUSABLY RUDE
AT YOUR BAKERY TODAY.

15:57.287 --> 15:59.990
Do you happen to know
their name?
 HER NAME?

15:59.990 --> 16:03.033
SARA MUNELLO.

16:03.033 --> 16:05.965
PRINCE MISHARI SIGNED OFF
ON THE INSPECTION REPORT.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.167
THAT'S GREAT.

16:07.167 --> 16:08.698
HIS FINAL REQUEST IS
FOR ADDITIONAL PICTURES

16:08.698 --> 16:10.600
OF YOUR PRIVATE BEACH.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.142
WELL, GIVEN THE KING'S RANSOM
HE'S PAYING,

16:12.142 --> 16:14.344
YOU AND YOUR PHOTOGRAPHER
WILL HAVE UNFETTERED ACCESS

16:14.344 --> 16:17.207
TO IMMORTALIZE
EVERY MAGNIFICENT ACRE.

16:17.207 --> 16:18.578
(chuckles)

16:18.578 --> 16:20.150
(chuckles)

16:20.150 --> 16:24.054
(scribbling)
 YOU KNOW, THIS DEAL
WENT DOWN SO QUICKLY.

16:24.054 --> 16:26.016
THERE ARE ROOMS HERE
I STILL HAVEN'T SEEN.

16:26.016 --> 16:28.018
OH.
 THE WALK-IN HUMIDOR.

16:28.018 --> 16:30.060
THE BILLIARDS HALL.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.691
YOUR BEDROOM SUITE.

16:31.691 --> 16:33.523
(waves crashing)

16:33.523 --> 16:35.725
I LOVE A GOOD MASTER.

16:35.725 --> 16:38.568
AND I LOVE THE ATTENTION
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

16:38.568 --> 16:42.172
HOWEVER... I'M NOT
IN THE MARKET FOR ONE.
 (footsteps approach)

16:42.172 --> 16:44.474
I THOUGHT I HEARD
THE CHATTER OF RATS,

16:44.474 --> 16:45.775
AND HERE YOU BOTH ARE.

16:45.775 --> 16:48.078
MORGAN, MIGHT I SUGGEST
A RENOVATION PROJECT

16:48.078 --> 16:49.609
TO THE PRINCE?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.541
SHOULD TEAR DOWN
THE CONSERVATORY.

16:51.541 --> 16:53.283
IT'S A USELESS ROOM.

17:06.195 --> 17:08.397
MR. MATHIS...

17:08.397 --> 17:10.200
I SUSPECT THAT MY HUSBAND

17:10.200 --> 17:13.233
AND HIS REAL ESTATE BROKER
ARE COLLUDING.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.434
TO WHAT END?

17:14.434 --> 17:16.106
TO HIDE THE PROFITS
OF THE SALE OF MY HOUSE.

17:16.106 --> 17:18.137
WELL, I'LL HAVE MY CONTACTS
IN BANKING

17:18.137 --> 17:19.138
LOOK INTO THE TRANSACTION

17:19.138 --> 17:21.070
AND REPORT
ANY SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY.

17:21.070 --> 17:23.742
THANK YOU.
 IN THE MEANTIME, I SUPPOSE

17:23.742 --> 17:25.145
I SHOULD MAKE
NEW LIVING ARRANGEMENTS.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.346
OH, DON'T BE SILLY.

17:26.346 --> 17:28.548
AS LONG AS YOU KEEP
WHAT PATRICK DID A SECRET,

17:28.548 --> 17:30.250
YOU'LL ALWAYS HAVE
A PLACE WITH ME.

17:31.681 --> 17:33.153
WELL,
THEN CONSIDER IT DONE.

17:33.153 --> 17:34.354
NOW IF I WERE YOU,

17:34.354 --> 17:35.785
I WOULD SPEND LESS TIME

17:35.785 --> 17:37.787
READING
ABOUT TOURIST DESTINATIONS

17:37.787 --> 17:39.689
AND MORE TIME
EXPLORING WAYS

17:39.689 --> 17:41.791
WE CAN SEND EMILY THORNE
PACKING.

17:46.696 --> 17:50.069
(footsteps retreat)

17:50.069 --> 17:52.772
(cell phone buzzes)

17:52.772 --> 17:54.174
(buzz, chirp)

17:54.174 --> 17:56.146
HEY, SORRY, I GOT SWAMPED
HERE IN THE CITY.

17:56.146 --> 17:57.177
UH, I'M COMING HOME SOON.

17:57.177 --> 17:58.578
Don't bother.

17:58.578 --> 18:00.450
A RANDOM CRACK OPENED UP
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

18:00.450 --> 18:01.711
SO I CALLED THE CONTRACTOR,

18:01.711 --> 18:05.515
AND GUESS WHAT WE HAVE?
FOUNDATION ISSUES.

18:05.515 --> 18:07.117
WHAT, YOU GET
A SECOND OPINION?

18:07.117 --> 18:10.360
Just got a third. They start
work early tomorrow,

18:10.360 --> 18:11.821
SO YOU SHOULD PROBABLY JUST
STAY AT THE PENTHOUSE.

18:11.821 --> 18:12.792
YOU SURE YOU DON'T NEED MY HELP?

18:12.792 --> 18:14.264
No, I got it covered.

18:14.264 --> 18:15.825
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT'S SAFE
TO COME HOME, OKAY?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.769
Daniel?

18:19.769 --> 18:22.101
EVERYTHING OKAY?

18:22.101 --> 18:23.203
Yeah.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.875
JUST PREOCCUPIED
WITH SOME... WORK.

18:25.875 --> 18:27.377
UM...

18:27.377 --> 18:30.210
I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE THERE
TO HELP.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.382
TRUST ME, I'M FINE.

18:32.382 --> 18:34.214
GOOD NIGHT.

18:34.214 --> 18:35.715
(cell phone beeps)

18:35.715 --> 18:37.717
(sets down cell phone)

18:37.717 --> 18:38.718
DO IT.

18:41.391 --> 18:45.325
(clattering)

18:45.325 --> 18:46.496
(grunts)

18:46.496 --> 18:47.857
TO MY ULTIMATE REVENGE.

18:47.857 --> 18:50.260
MAY IT UNFOLD
AS WE'VE PLANNED.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.762
(clink)
 IT WILL.

18:52.762 --> 18:54.734
(beer sloshes)
 (swallows)

18:54.734 --> 18:55.835
(exhales)

19:00.340 --> 19:01.441
(sighs)

19:01.441 --> 19:05.815
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
I'D HANDLE THIS ALONE,

19:05.815 --> 19:07.877
AND I DIDN'T NEED
ANYBODY'S HELP.

19:07.877 --> 19:10.920
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT'S HOW
WE WERE TRAINED.

19:10.920 --> 19:13.853
I CAN'T IMAGINE DOING THIS
WITHOUT YOU, AIDEN.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.386
NOT ANYMORE.

19:16.386 --> 19:20.460
LOOK, OUR FUTURE'S SO CLOSE.

19:20.460 --> 19:22.732
WE PLAY THIS RIGHT,

19:22.732 --> 19:25.835
IT'S JUST ME... YOU...

19:25.835 --> 19:27.497
AND A BEACH
IN THE MALDIVES.

19:27.497 --> 19:28.938
SOUNDS LIKE A DREAM.

19:28.938 --> 19:30.700
OH, IT'S REAL.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.603
(thud)
 (exhales)

19:36.476 --> 19:37.877
(grunts)

19:37.877 --> 19:41.211
(both breathing heavily)

19:45.655 --> 19:47.457
♪♪♪

19:47.457 --> 19:48.488
(door opens)

19:48.488 --> 19:51.491
(chuckles)

19:51.491 --> 19:53.923
DAMN... STOWAWAY.

19:53.923 --> 19:56.766
OH, YOU CLEAN UP NICE.
 MM-HMM. (chuckles)

19:56.766 --> 19:58.768
THE ONLY THING I HATE
ABOUT THIS SEXY LITTLE MINX

19:58.768 --> 20:01.771
IS THAT, UH,
SHE'S CLOSED TODAY.

20:01.771 --> 20:04.904
THIS SEAT'S, UH,
ALWAYS OPEN FOR FRIENDS.

20:04.904 --> 20:07.437
(chuckles)
 (bottle scrapes counter)

20:07.437 --> 20:10.240
SOMETHING THE MATTER?

20:10.240 --> 20:12.612
(sighs) YEAH...

20:12.612 --> 20:13.913
(glasses thud and clink)

20:13.913 --> 20:14.914
EMILY.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.946
SHE'S KINDA SCREWING
WITH MY LIFE,

20:16.946 --> 20:18.648
AND I WANT IT TO STOP.

20:18.648 --> 20:19.819
(bottle thuds)

20:19.819 --> 20:21.591
CALL HER ON IT.
DON'T BACK DOWN.

20:21.591 --> 20:25.695
WELL, YOU DO SPEAK
FROM EXPERIENCE, OR...

20:25.695 --> 20:27.757
AT LEAST, I IMAGINE YOU DO,

20:27.757 --> 20:29.599
OR I DON'T KNOW, OR NOT.
FORGET IT. IGNORE ME.

20:29.599 --> 20:31.331
JUST--JUST TALK, NOLAN.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.933
SHE'S NOT COMPLETELY
OFF-BASE.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.406
STILL, I HAD TO MAKE
A CHOICE.

20:36.406 --> 20:38.938
SO I MADE THE ONE
THAT'S RIGHT FOR ME.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.841
(gulps) AHH.
 (glass thuds)

20:41.841 --> 20:43.573
I'M...

20:43.573 --> 20:45.845
♪♪♪

20:45.845 --> 20:47.947
I'M SEEING PATRICK OSBOURNE.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.879
♪♪♪

20:49.879 --> 20:51.951
VICTORIA GRAYSON'S PATRICK?

20:51.951 --> 20:53.953
SEE, EMILY THINKS
HE'S SHADY.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.556
(sighs)
 BUT I THINK HE'S THE ONE.

20:56.556 --> 20:57.787
YEAH, NO, I MEAN,
I KNOW IT'S FAST.

20:57.787 --> 20:59.489
IT IS, NOLAN. IT IS.

20:59.489 --> 21:01.931
LOOK, I'VE HEARD THINGS
ABOUT HIM. HE'S MESSED UP.

21:01.931 --> 21:04.564
HE TRIED TO KILL CONRAD.
INSTEAD HE KILLED THAT PRIEST.

21:04.564 --> 21:07.697
DID SHE TELL YOU THAT?

21:07.697 --> 21:08.698
"SHE" WHO?

21:08.698 --> 21:10.940
EMILY.

21:10.940 --> 21:13.573
YEAH, THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU
WOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT PATRICK

21:13.573 --> 21:15.805
IS IF SHE DISCUSSED IT
WITH YOU.

21:22.412 --> 21:25.014
(sighs) YOU KNOW...

21:25.014 --> 21:29.459
I'M DONE
TALKING AROUND WHAT'S REAL

21:29.459 --> 21:31.521
WHEN WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO.

21:31.521 --> 21:34.664
I CAN'T SIT IN A CHAIR
RESERVED FOR FRIENDS

21:34.664 --> 21:37.327
AND LIE TO YOUR FACE
ANYMORE.

21:38.968 --> 21:41.571
EMILY THORNE...

21:41.571 --> 21:43.833
IS AMANDA CLARKE.

21:43.833 --> 21:46.376
YOU KNOW IT.

21:46.376 --> 21:48.378
I KNOW IT.

21:48.378 --> 21:52.942
AND NOW WE BOTH KNOW
THE TRUTH ABOUT EACH OTHER.

22:00.420 --> 22:01.621
(waves crashing,
camera shutter clicking)

22:01.621 --> 22:03.893
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE THEY OWN
HALF THE HAMPTONS.

22:03.893 --> 22:06.856
(camera shutter
continues clicking)

22:06.856 --> 22:08.428
HOW'S THAT?
 (engine starts)

22:08.428 --> 22:10.930
YEAH.
 (vehicle reverse alert beeping)

22:10.930 --> 22:12.732
BE RIGHT BACK.
 OKAY.

22:12.732 --> 22:15.034
(speaking indistinctly)
 (whirring)

22:15.034 --> 22:18.808
(continues
speaking indistinctly)

22:18.808 --> 22:20.570
(drilling in distance)
 HI.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.011
I-I'M MORGAN HOLT--

22:22.011 --> 22:24.544
THE AGENT FOR THE PROPERTY
NEXT DOOR.
 OF COURSE, MISS HOLT.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.746
I'M EMILY,
DANIEL GRAYSON'S FIANCéE.

22:26.746 --> 22:28.518
CONGRATULATIONS
ON WHAT'S SURE TO BE

22:28.518 --> 22:29.779
THE BIGGEST SALE
OF THE YEAR.

22:29.779 --> 22:31.481
(chuckles) TRY DECADE.

22:31.481 --> 22:35.084
(chuckles)
 EMILY, YOU'VE GOT SUCH
A RUCKUS GOING ON OVER HERE.

22:35.084 --> 22:37.527
I TRUST THIS PROJECT
WILL BE ENDING SOON?

22:37.527 --> 22:39.429
(sighs) WELL,
HOPEFULLY TOMORROW,

22:39.429 --> 22:41.360
BUT THEN I'LL HAVE
TO DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

22:41.360 --> 22:42.662
IN A COUPLE OF YEARS.

22:42.662 --> 22:43.733
THAT'S HOW LONG
MY CONTRACTOR SAYS

22:43.733 --> 22:45.595
I CAN STAVE OFF
MOTHER NATURE.

22:45.595 --> 22:46.896
WHAT ON EARTH DO YOU MEAN?

22:46.896 --> 22:49.469
MY FOUNDATION'S
SHIFTING AGAIN.

22:49.469 --> 22:50.700
AGAIN?

22:50.700 --> 22:52.041
CAN'T YOU SHORE IT UP?

22:52.041 --> 22:53.773
THE PROBLEM IS THE GROUND
 UNDER THE FOUNDATION.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.745
ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERS
CALL IT

22:55.745 --> 22:57.747
"DRAMATIC BEACH EROSION."

22:57.747 --> 22:59.879
IT'S A BIG PROBLEM
ON THIS SIDE OF THE ISLAND.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.411
WELL, THERE MUST BE
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO.

23:01.411 --> 23:03.052
SADLY, NO.

23:03.052 --> 23:04.854
AND IF GLOBAL WARMING
CONTINUES

23:04.854 --> 23:07.487
TO SPAWN MORE SUPERSTORMS,

23:07.487 --> 23:09.819
THE BEACH IS GONNA DISAPPEAR
IN HALF THAT TIME.

23:09.819 --> 23:12.822
STILL, HOW CAN YOU RESIST
A VIEW LIKE THAT?

23:12.822 --> 23:14.924
FOR NOW, I'M JUST GONNA
FIGHT THE USELESS FIGHT

23:14.924 --> 23:16.826
UNTIL I RUN OUT OF MONEY...

23:16.826 --> 23:17.867
OR SAND. (chuckles)

23:17.867 --> 23:21.601
EXCUSE ME.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.473
(footsteps depart)

23:23.473 --> 23:25.735
(drilling and hammering
in distance)

23:25.735 --> 23:27.106
(Jack) NOLAN?

23:29.579 --> 23:33.182
YOU LEFT THIS
AT THE STOWAWAY.
 (cell phone thuds)

23:33.182 --> 23:35.515
YEAH, I REALIZED THAT
AFTER YOU...

23:35.515 --> 23:37.987
THREW ME
OUT OF THE BAR.

23:37.987 --> 23:41.651
SO WAIT, ARE WE...
SPEAKING AGAIN? OR...

23:41.651 --> 23:44.854
THERE'S SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN
EATING AWAY AT ME.

23:44.854 --> 23:46.425
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?

23:46.425 --> 23:49.899
I'VE NEVER NOT KNOWN.

23:49.899 --> 23:52.532
(inhales sharply)

23:52.532 --> 23:55.204
BEFORE HE DIED,
HER FATHER MADE ME PROMISE

23:55.204 --> 23:57.637
THAT I WOULD
LOOK OUT FOR HER.

23:57.637 --> 24:01.010
IT'S A SIMPLE REQUEST
FROM A MAN THAT I IDOLIZED.

24:01.010 --> 24:05.575
I JUST... NEVER REALIZED
IT WOULD BLOW UP INTO THIS.

24:05.575 --> 24:07.917
I SHOULD HAVE JUST
COME OUT AND ASKED YOU.

24:07.917 --> 24:09.879
IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T
SUSPECT THAT YOU KNEW,

24:09.879 --> 24:11.481
BUT THE CHANCE
THAT YOU DIDN'T

24:11.481 --> 24:13.753
ALWAYS STOPPED ME.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.224
(chuckles) I HATE THAT
MY FIRST INSTINCT

24:15.224 --> 24:18.688
IS TO PROTECT HER
AFTER EVERYTHING SHE'S DONE!

24:18.688 --> 24:21.791
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

24:23.793 --> 24:25.765
WHY DO WE DO IT?

24:25.765 --> 24:30.169
BECAUSE WE SEE THE BROKEN
AND BETRAYED LITTLE GIRL INSIDE.

24:30.169 --> 24:34.073
I UNDERSTAND
IF OUR RELATIONSHIP

24:34.073 --> 24:36.506
IS FINISHED.

24:36.506 --> 24:40.049
IF IT IS...

24:40.049 --> 24:42.612
AT LEAST IT ENDED IN TRUTH.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.189
I'M YOUR FRIEND, NOLAN.

24:52.121 --> 24:54.093
(sighs)

24:54.093 --> 24:57.196
UNFORTUNATELY, FRIENDS
CAN'T ALWAYS TELL EACH OTHER

24:57.196 --> 24:58.598
WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR.

25:00.499 --> 25:01.901
I GET WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

25:01.901 --> 25:03.633
I MARRIED SOMEONE WITH SECRETS,
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS

25:03.633 --> 25:05.975
I NEVER REALLY KNEW
WHO AMANDA WAS.

25:05.975 --> 25:08.608
YOU KNOW FULL WELL
ABOUT PATRICK.

25:08.608 --> 25:10.810
PATRICK'S NOT EVIL.
 THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.612
I'M SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW
PATRICK DOESN'T KNOW

25:12.612 --> 25:14.644
THAT CHARLOTTE
TOOK THE RAP FOR HIM.

25:14.644 --> 25:19.018
YES, TAKING HER OUT
WOULD BE ONE WAY OF ENSURING

25:19.018 --> 25:22.521
THAT THE BLAME STAYS
WITH HER, BUT, UH...

25:22.521 --> 25:23.893
IF YOU CAN TELL ME
WITH 100% CERTAINTY

25:23.893 --> 25:27.196
THAT HE WON'T BE DRIVEN
TO HURT ANYONE ELSE...

25:27.196 --> 25:28.958
I'LL DROP THIS.

25:34.203 --> 25:36.205
THEN I HAVE TO LET HIM GO.

25:38.067 --> 25:41.741
BUT... HOW?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.573
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

25:48.748 --> 25:50.750
DID YOU WANT
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO HIM?

25:50.750 --> 25:52.652
I DON'T THINK I CAN.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.892
WILL YOU PROMISE ME...

26:02.892 --> 26:04.834
THAT HE WON'T BE HURT?

26:13.943 --> 26:15.775
(knock on door)

26:15.775 --> 26:18.307
(dogs barking,
children shouting in distance)

26:18.307 --> 26:20.880
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.051
I STOPPED BY YOUR WORK

26:22.051 --> 26:24.013
TO APOLOGIZE FOR
WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY.

26:24.013 --> 26:25.855
YOUR BOSS GAVE ME
YOUR ADDRESS.

26:25.855 --> 26:27.216
EX-BOSS.

26:27.216 --> 26:28.718
I WAS FIRED.

26:28.718 --> 26:29.959
I'M SO SORRY.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.791
IT'S NOT ON YOU
TO APOLOGIZE.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.823
FOR THE RECORD, IT WAS
DANIEL'S FIANCéE EMILY

26:33.823 --> 26:35.194
WHO GAVE THE DETAILS
OF THE CAR ACCIDENT

26:35.194 --> 26:36.726
TO THE MAGAZINE.

26:36.726 --> 26:38.297
HE'S NOT THE SAME
SPOILED FRAT BOY, SARA.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.699
HE'S CHANGED.

26:39.699 --> 26:40.800
YEAH, WELL, IT SEEMS
HE STILL HAS OTHER PEOPLE

26:40.800 --> 26:42.371
CLEANING UP HIS MESSES,
SO...

26:42.371 --> 26:44.734
HE'D KILL ME
IF HE KNEW I WAS HERE.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.906
I KNOW YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA BE ANGRY AT HIM FOREVER--

26:46.906 --> 26:47.937
ANGRY?

26:47.937 --> 26:50.279
I HATE HIM...

26:52.311 --> 26:54.613
BUT NOT AS MUCH
AS I HATE MYSELF.

26:54.613 --> 26:58.087
YOU KNOW, AFTER ALL THE HELL
THAT DANNY'S PUT ME THROUGH...

27:00.219 --> 27:03.292
MY HEART STILL SKIPPED A BEAT
WHEN I SAW HIM YESTERDAY.

27:06.295 --> 27:08.397
IS THAT PATHETIC OR WHAT?

27:08.397 --> 27:11.030
NOT AT ALL.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.201
WHATEVER.

27:12.201 --> 27:14.063
LOOK, I'VE GOT STUFF TO DO.

27:14.063 --> 27:17.406
A NEW JOB'S NOT JUST
GONNA COMING KNOCKING. SO...

27:17.406 --> 27:18.968
OR MAYBE IT JUST DID.

27:25.815 --> 27:27.646
I AM NOT ACCUSTOMED
TO RUSHING HOME

27:27.646 --> 27:29.278
FOR CRYPTIC TEXTS,
MR. MATHIS,

27:29.278 --> 27:30.880
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M
IN THE MIDDLE OF A SALE

27:30.880 --> 27:32.381
WITH BRANCUSI BRONZE.

27:32.381 --> 27:34.253
WHAT COULD POSSIBLY
BE SO URGENT?

27:34.253 --> 27:36.125
A TIME-SENSITIVE TRANSACTION
ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE

27:36.125 --> 27:38.187
IN CONRAD'S OFFICE, WHICH
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT ENJOY.

27:38.187 --> 27:39.689
THANK YOU.

27:40.930 --> 27:42.832
(bottle clinks)

27:42.832 --> 27:44.894
(footsteps approach)

27:44.894 --> 27:48.798
YOU'LL HAVE TO POUR ANOTHER ONE
FOR YOUR PROPERTY PROSTITUTE.

27:48.798 --> 27:50.139
I ASSUME THAT'S WHO
YOU'LL BE FêTING?

27:50.139 --> 27:53.803
INDEED, MORGAN IS ON HER WAY
WITH THE CLOSING DOCUMENTS.

27:53.803 --> 27:55.805
AND I EXPECT TO SEE
EVERY LINE ITEM

27:55.805 --> 27:58.277
OF THAT DEAL...
TO THE CENT.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.250
AHH, THE STEADY THRUM
OF YOUR PERSECUTION COMPLEX.

28:01.250 --> 28:02.782
FEAR NOT, VICTORIA.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.814
THERE'LL BE ENOUGH PROFIT
 TO GO AROUND.

28:04.814 --> 28:06.115
NOT ANYMORE.

28:06.115 --> 28:09.889
WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING
TO DISCLOSE

28:09.889 --> 28:12.862
THE 30 FEET OF BEACHFRONT
YOU LOST IN THE LAST 20 YEARS?

28:12.862 --> 28:13.923
THAT'S ABSURD.

28:13.923 --> 28:15.324
OUR BEACH IS AS BIG
AS IT'S ALWAYS BEEN.

28:15.324 --> 28:18.367
IS IT? HERE'S THE COASTAL
COMMISSION'S MOST RECENT SURVEY.

28:18.367 --> 28:22.171
WHAT DO YOU KNOW, CONRAD?
WE'RE SLIPPING INTO THE SEA.

28:22.171 --> 28:25.104
THE SHORELINE EROSION
IS INDISPUTABLE.

28:25.104 --> 28:28.908
KEEPING IT FROM THE BUYER
IS FRAUD AND MAKES ME LIABLE.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.310
OH, WELL,
NOT IF YOU'RE FIRED.

28:31.310 --> 28:35.044
(chuckles) YOU THINK YOU CAN
JUST HIRE SOMEONE ELSE?

28:35.044 --> 28:38.247
NO ONE IS COMING NEAR
YOUR TOXIC PROPERTY

28:38.247 --> 28:40.349
WHEN I TELL EVERY BROKER
IN NEW YORK

28:40.349 --> 28:42.121
HOW YOU TRIED TO SCREW ME.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.426
(thuds)

28:51.100 --> 28:52.932
YOU DID THIS.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.805
YOU'RE SO DESPERATE TO KEEP
THIS IN YOUR FEEBLE GRASP,

28:55.805 --> 28:57.767
THAT YOU JUST RUINED
AN EXTRAORDINARY CHANCE

28:57.767 --> 29:01.010
FOR ME TO KEEP THIS FAMILY
SOLVENT AND INTACT.

29:01.010 --> 29:02.872
OH, CONRAD,
MY HANDS ARE CLEAN.

29:02.872 --> 29:05.174
AND THIS PILE HASN'T BEEN
A HOME FOR YEARS.

29:05.174 --> 29:07.376
WHICH IS WHY I'M DOING
WHAT I NEVER THOUGHT I COULD--

29:07.376 --> 29:08.918
LETTING GO OF GRAYSON MANOR.

29:08.918 --> 29:10.449
I'VE BEEN PUTTING
MY AFFAIRS IN ORDER,

29:10.449 --> 29:13.823
AND I AM LEAVING IT AND YOU
PERMANENTLY.

29:13.823 --> 29:16.886
WELL... IF IT'S
A DIVORCE YOU WANT,

29:16.886 --> 29:19.758
YOU BETTER BRACE YOURSELF
FOR A FIGHT.

29:19.758 --> 29:23.262
WELL, THAT'S THE BEAUTY
OF WHAT'S BEFORE US.

29:23.262 --> 29:26.765
WITH A WORTHLESS ESTATE,
THERE'S NOTHING TO FIGHT FOR.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.297
(clinks and fizzes)

29:28.297 --> 29:29.899
I'LL BE OUT BY WEEK'S END.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.443
SHE HAS TO STAY.

29:34.443 --> 29:35.905
WELL, UNFORTUNATELY,
THERE'S NO WAY TO KEEP VICTORIA

29:35.905 --> 29:38.047
INSIDE THE HOUSE
OR THE MARRIAGE.

29:38.047 --> 29:39.208
EVERYTHING SHE CARES ABOUT

29:39.208 --> 29:41.811
NOW LIES OUTSIDE
THE GRAYSON EMPIRE.

29:41.811 --> 29:43.883
THE GRAYSONS HAVE TAKEN
EVERYTHING FROM ME.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.415
I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM
TAKE AWAY MY FUTURE WITH YOU.

29:49.058 --> 29:51.260
SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

29:51.260 --> 29:55.064
TRAP HER WITH THE ONE THING
SHE CAN'T RESIST.

30:01.330 --> 30:02.471
WELL, THE FACT IS

30:02.471 --> 30:03.933
YOU'RE MY REAL ESTATE ATTORNEY,
EDWARD.

30:03.933 --> 30:05.935
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO KNOW
ABOUT THE EROSION ISSUE.

30:05.935 --> 30:08.807
WELL, INSTEAD...

30:08.807 --> 30:12.411
LOOK, YOU'VE COST ME MILLIONS!
ALL RIGHT?

30:12.411 --> 30:15.544
I'LL SEE YOU IN COURT.
 (cell phone beeps and clatters)

30:15.544 --> 30:19.118

AFTER OUR CHAT.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.834
WELL, WHAT COULD WE POSSIBLY
HAVE TO DISCUSS?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.566
THE ONLY CONCERN
THAT WE SHARE--

30:37.566 --> 30:39.338
CHARLOTTE'S SAFETY.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.871
CONTINUE.

30:41.871 --> 30:42.872
MY INFORMATION ISN'T FREE.

30:42.872 --> 30:44.914

30:44.914 --> 30:46.545
YOU ARE MUCH TOO LATE
FOR A HANDOUT.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.217
I DON'T WANT MONEY.

30:48.217 --> 30:50.379
FIRST--I WANT YOUR WORD

30:50.379 --> 30:53.252
THAT YOU WILL HANDLE THIS
WITHOUT BLOODSHED.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.924
AND SECOND--

30:54.924 --> 30:57.586
YOU AND I WILL NEVER
BE GOOD,

32:52.371 --> 32:55.074
YEAH, JACK WENT TO, UH,
CONRAD,

32:55.074 --> 32:58.407

TAMPERED WITH HIS BRAKES.

ACTUALLY, I GAVE HIM
MY BLESSING.

33:04.653 --> 33:07.216
THIS HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU, EMILY.

33:07.216 --> 33:09.288
VICTORIA TOOK A HUGE RISK
COVERING THAT UP.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.359
PATRICK IS PRECIOUS TO HER,

33:10.359 --> 33:11.690
WHICH MAKES HIM
INVALUABLE TO ME.

33:17.026 --> 33:19.368

TO KEEP US IN SEPARATE ORBITS,

33:34.583 --> 33:36.245
I'M GLAD WE DID,

33:36.245 --> 33:37.516
BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE
LIES BETWEEN US

33:37.516 --> 33:39.048
ABOUT YOU OR ANYTHING ELSE.
 (resumes chopping)

33:39.048 --> 33:41.290
THAT'S A HUGE MISTAKE.
 NOT FOR ME, IT WASN'T.

33:41.290 --> 33:44.623
YOUR NEED TO CONTROL
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE

33:44.623 --> 33:47.726
HAS KEPT ME ISOLATED
WHEN I DIDN'T NEED TO BE.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.798
I'VE HAD NO ONE ELSE
TO TALK TO

33:49.798 --> 33:51.660
ABOUT THE CRAP
THAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.562
I TALKED TO YOU
ABOUT PATRICK!

33:53.562 --> 33:55.604
ALL YOU DID WAS TELL ME
TO BE RATIONAL.

33:55.604 --> 33:58.137
I CAN'T TURN OFF MY EMOTIONS.
I'M NOT A ROBOT.

33:58.137 --> 34:00.239
I'M A HUMAN BEING.

34:00.239 --> 34:01.370
I THOUGHT WE WERE
ON THE SAME PAGE.

34:01.370 --> 34:02.741
YOU WANTED TO BE
A PART OF THIS.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.514
(sighs)

34:05.514 --> 34:07.416
YEAH.

34:07.416 --> 34:12.050
BUT, EMS, ALL I HAVE EVER
REALLY WANTED

34:12.050 --> 34:15.684
WAS FRIENDSHIP.

IN THIS BAYSHORE DUMP?

MY CONTACTS PROVIDED ME
WITH CONRAD'S FINANCIALS.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.399

AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:34.303 --> 34:36.245

A PROBLEM WITH SHARING.

IS LOCKED IN A WAREHOUSE

35:14.343 --> 35:15.484

35:15.484 --> 35:17.286

35:17.286 --> 35:18.417
WELL,
IF THAT'S THE TRUTH,

35:18.417 --> 35:20.219
I'D LIKE THE COORDINATES
OF THAT LOCATION.

DO NOT FEIGN IGNORANCE.

35:22.251 --> 35:23.522
WALKED AWAY FROM THIS MARRIAGE

OF THIS?

40:21.049 --> 40:22.491
GO!

40:25.053 --> 40:28.557
OBEY YOUR MOTHER.

40:38.967 --> 40:43.141
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN YOU UP
ON THAT GOOD-BYE.

40:43.141 --> 40:46.444
YEAH, THAT'S WHY
I OFFERED IT.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.217
NO CLOSURE SUCKS.

40:49.217 --> 40:50.579
(sighs)

40:50.579 --> 40:52.050
(Emily) HEY.

40:54.182 --> 40:55.924
EMILY.

40:55.924 --> 40:57.856
WHAT'S WRONG?

40:57.856 --> 41:01.189
LOOK, I'M...

41:01.189 --> 41:05.093
I KNOW I'M NOT VERY GOOD
AT EXPRESSING MYSELF.

41:07.996 --> 41:10.539
THE THING IS, Y--

41:10.539 --> 41:13.872
YOU'RE TWO OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE.

41:13.872 --> 41:17.175
THE WEDDING IS IN FIVE WEEKS,
AND--AND THIS--

41:17.175 --> 41:20.208
THIS LAST BIT OF TIME
WE HAVE--

41:20.208 --> 41:23.251
I DON'T WANT EITHER OF YOU
TO FEEL ALONE OR IN THE DARK

41:23.251 --> 41:24.513
OR AT RISK...

41:24.513 --> 41:28.216
BECAUSE OF ME.

41:28.216 --> 41:31.560
I WANT NOTHING LEFT UNSAID.

41:31.560 --> 41:34.122
UH, WHY?
YOU'RE LEAVING LONG ISLAND,

41:34.122 --> 41:36.124
NOT THE PLANET.

41:36.124 --> 41:39.027
IN ORDER FOR ME
TO DO THIS PROPERLY,

41:39.027 --> 41:43.201
I... HAVE TO DISAPPEAR
WITHOUT A TRACE.

41:45.273 --> 41:47.105
I'LL BE GONE FOR GOOD.
YOU'LL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN.

41:56.184 --> 41:58.286
IS THAT ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY?

41:58.286 --> 42:00.589
NO.

42:00.589 --> 42:02.821
LIKE I SAID, I WANT
TO TELL YOU EVERYTHING...

42:05.924 --> 42:09.898
INCLUDING MY PLAN
FOR AUGUST 8th...

42:09.898 --> 42:13.261
THE DAY VICTORIA GRAYSON...

42:13.261 --> 42:17.135
GOES DOWN FOR
THE MURDER OF EMILY THORNE.

42:19.207 --> 42:20.609
(sighs)
