Settle down!

29:32.800 --> 29:33.995
Settle down,
you're gonna get hurt.

29:34.080 --> 29:36.197
Okay?

29:39.080 --> 29:40.514
I won't say anything.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.398
I promise I won't say
anything to anyone.

29:42.480 --> 29:43.596
Just please don't hurt me.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.080
We're not going
to hurt you.

29:45.440 --> 29:47.796
But you do need to answer
some questions.

29:47.880 --> 29:49.200
Do you understand?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.191
What do you know about
Dr. Lawrence Strickland?

29:54.960 --> 29:57.316
He's my daughter's
pediatrician.

29:59.760 --> 30:00.830
That's it?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.432
He helps me with
my research, sometimes.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.273
He's a very gifted geneticist.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.472
You may as well
put the next one in me.

32:04.400 --> 32:05.436
Seriously?

32:08.560 --> 32:09.596
You know what
your problem is?

32:09.800 --> 32:10.916
I'd like to.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.276
I'm gonna tell you.
Your problem is

32:13.360 --> 32:15.192
the only person you give
a shit about is yourself.

32:16.240 --> 32:17.913
Isn't that

32:18.040 --> 32:19.440
If they're being honest?

32:19.520 --> 32:21.193
(SIGHS) There's
a lot of people coming

32:21.280 --> 32:23.670
aboard this station right now,
Amos, and they need our help.

32:23.760 --> 32:25.592
- So why don't you help them.
- I am.

32:25.680 --> 32:27.990
What I'm trying to figure out
is why you won't.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.675
'Cause as far as I can tell,
you got nothing better to do.

32:30.800 --> 32:32.519
'Cause I don't
feel like it, Alex.

32:32.760 --> 32:34.479
You don't feel like it.
Really?

32:34.560 --> 32:36.199
That's your answer,
"You don't feel like it?"

32:36.280 --> 32:38.112
That's not good enough, Amos.

32:38.200 --> 32:39.873
That's not good enough.

32:41.080 --> 32:42.594
We help each other.

32:42.680 --> 32:44.080
That's what people do.
We help.

32:44.200 --> 32:46.078
That's why
we have a civilization.

32:46.720 --> 32:49.076
So then why don't you
help your family.

32:49.160 --> 32:50.150
What?

32:50.280 --> 32:52.033
They're right there on Mars,
where you left them.

32:53.320 --> 32:54.390
Goddamn you.

32:54.480 --> 32:55.755

throw that in my face?

Naomi's been monitoring

33:55.280 --> 33:56.350
one of the hangar bays

33:56.440 --> 33:57.794
where Fred Johnson
stashed all the nukes.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.077
Why would she do that?

34:00.160 --> 34:01.480
She's smart.

34:03.520 --> 34:06.752
ALEX: Hey, someone's trying to
access the missile controls.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.274
Holy shit.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.996
Looks like they're
preparing to launch.

34:13.199 --> 34:14.953
I don't remember any

34:15.040 --> 34:17.235
project Dr. Strickland
was involved in.

34:17.320 --> 34:18.549
(PHONE RINGING)

34:18.639 --> 34:21.518
He was my daughter's
pediatrician, that's it.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.510
When was the last time
you saw him?

34:25.760 --> 34:27.717
A few hours
before my dome was hit.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.234
My daughter, Mei,
was with him.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.754
She had an appointment
at the clinic.

34:30.880 --> 34:33.395
I had some work to do,
so I couldn't go with her.

34:35.239 --> 34:36.719
When the mirror fell,

34:38.040 --> 34:39.554
the clinic was wiped out.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.119
I should've gone with her.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.592
Unless he's
a phenomenal liar,

34:47.679 --> 34:50.514
I don't think he has anything
to do with the protomolecule.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.670
It's not him.

34:52.360 --> 34:56.070
Strickland turned up on
Ganymede as a pediatrician.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.436
The connection
is the daughter.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.760
Corporate clinics are legally
required to let parents

35:03.840 --> 35:05.877
remotely monitor their
children from anywhere, right?

35:07.000 --> 35:08.275
You have children
of your own.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.430
No.

35:10.120 --> 35:13.158
Could you please show us
whatever you can of Mei?

35:24.440 --> 35:26.193
Strickland took her
out of the clinic.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.231
NAOMI: This is nearly an hour
before the mirror fell.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.519
Your daughter might
still be alive.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.196
He knew a battle was coming.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.439
And he went back for the girl.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.720
You're going to Ganymede
to find Dr. Strickland?

35:52.400 --> 35:54.073
