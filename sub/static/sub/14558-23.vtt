WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.105
(fast-tempo African drum rhythm
playing)

00:18.819 --> 00:20.721
(villagers singing
in native language)

00:26.494 --> 00:28.129
(singing continues)

00:37.871 --> 00:40.241
Put it right
over here, okay?

00:43.377 --> 00:45.213
All the way
to the back, yeah?

00:45.246 --> 00:48.649
(singing continues)

00:51.252 --> 00:53.654
MAN: Last one. Thanks, guys.

00:53.687 --> 00:55.156
Everybody out.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.659
(drum rhythm continues)

00:59.793 --> 01:01.762
(beeping)

01:12.406 --> 01:13.707
Ready to get
back to Africa?

01:13.741 --> 01:15.643
You know it.
See you in Lusaka.

01:17.611 --> 01:19.313
- Be well.
- Thank you.

01:20.714 --> 01:22.683
Be careful.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.618
(singing, drum rhythm
conclude)

01:26.187 --> 01:28.222
BRADFORD: You talk a lot about
your work,

01:28.256 --> 01:29.657
but I want to go
a little further.

01:29.690 --> 01:32.126
What else is in your life?

01:32.160 --> 01:34.462
What, that I'm a workaholic with
commitment issues

01:34.495 --> 01:36.797
that has a hard time trusting
people is not enough?

01:36.830 --> 01:38.532
I mean, like, your family.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.502
What, I've said, I think...

01:41.535 --> 01:43.871
you know, we're okay.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.839
What about your brother?

02:04.358 --> 02:06.594
DON:
It's not like I don't know

02:06.627 --> 02:08.596
that my parents didn't have
their hands full with Charlie.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.631
You know when you talk
about your brother,

02:10.664 --> 02:11.899
I get this feeling
that you choose

02:11.932 --> 02:12.966
your words very carefully.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.536
Yeah, what, I don't want
you to get the wrong idea.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.571
You don't want me to think
that you hate Charlie.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.207
That's not true.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.941
No, it's not.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.075
Look, hey...

02:22.109 --> 02:25.379
I really think that most
of the time, he and I are, uh...

02:25.413 --> 02:26.914
you know... we're good.

02:26.947 --> 02:29.417
- And the other times?
- Look, I mean,

02:29.450 --> 02:32.586
sometimes the glory
and the accolades...

02:32.620 --> 02:34.722
And taking
all your parents' time.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.857
Yeah, this curly-headed
black hole

02:36.890 --> 02:38.926
that can suck the air
out of the universe.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.295
So you felt cheated?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.968
MAN (over radio):
Why are you slowing down?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.937
What's the problem?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.739
Minor accident.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.973
LAPD's on the scene.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.275
Got it.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.627
(tires screeching)

03:18.532 --> 03:20.601
Out of the truck, now!
Out of the truck!

03:20.634 --> 03:22.636
- Go! Go! Move, now! Now!
- I got it. I got it!

03:25.973 --> 03:28.842
Put the gun down! Now!

03:28.876 --> 03:31.912
Drop the gun!
Get on the ground now!

03:31.945 --> 03:32.780
(sirens approaching)

03:32.813 --> 03:35.416
You just picked the wrong rig
to jack.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.751
(sirens stop)

03:40.053 --> 03:41.422
It's really not your day, is it?

03:41.455 --> 03:43.357
You're right, it's mine.

03:45.393 --> 03:46.860
(groans)

03:46.894 --> 03:48.929
Freeze! Get down!

03:48.962 --> 03:50.030
Get down on the ground.

03:50.063 --> 03:51.031
Out of the truck!

03:51.064 --> 03:52.533
Hurry up!

03:52.566 --> 03:53.667
On the ground.

03:55.636 --> 03:56.970
Bring 'em around.
Bring 'em around.

03:59.307 --> 04:01.309
All right...

04:01.342 --> 04:02.843
which one of you
two knows the code?

04:04.044 --> 04:04.712
Huh?!

04:04.745 --> 04:06.314
Neither of us.

04:06.347 --> 04:07.948
Who the hell
are these people?

04:07.981 --> 04:10.017
You said we stop the truck,
we get the cargo.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.785
We got a deal, man.

04:11.819 --> 04:12.886
Put them both
in the truck, Zack.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.389
Where're our TVs?
Open the truck!

04:15.423 --> 04:16.990
Got the GPS.

04:17.024 --> 04:18.025
Perfect.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.029
You listening to me?

04:22.062 --> 04:23.297
No.

04:23.331 --> 04:24.532
(cocks guns)

04:24.565 --> 04:26.033
Damn.

04:26.066 --> 04:28.001
This is messed up, man.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.303
(chuckles)

04:36.076 --> 04:37.978
(indistinct radio transmission)

04:43.551 --> 04:45.853
(phone ringing)

04:47.921 --> 04:50.991
Oh, I'm sorry,
I really have to get it.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.860
After what happened last time,
I trust you.

04:52.893 --> 04:53.661
All right.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.830
Hey, you know, Don?

04:56.864 --> 04:59.099
Next time...

04:59.132 --> 05:00.701
why don't you bring Charlie?

05:00.734 --> 05:03.003
(scoffs)

05:03.036 --> 05:04.838
Truck hijacking.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.073
Guard was hit
with a shotgun,

05:06.106 --> 05:08.442
the robbers had
automatic weapons.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.610
Who are these guys?

05:09.643 --> 05:11.044
The heist crew hired
some local talent

05:11.078 --> 05:12.846
to make the initial stop.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.082
Kid with the bandanna

05:15.115 --> 05:17.418
is Roberto Menchavez,
aka Lucky Dog,

05:17.451 --> 05:19.453
leader of the
7th Street Gang.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.121
All right, Lucky, tell
us again, what happened?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.123
Listen, man,

05:23.156 --> 05:24.958
we just supposed to show up
and scare some people.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.794
- Mm-hmm.
- Next thing everybody's

05:26.827 --> 05:28.128
gatted up and going Eastwood.

05:28.161 --> 05:28.962
Yeah? Who had the automatics?

05:28.996 --> 05:31.965
Some white dudes
who don't play fair

05:31.999 --> 05:32.766
and don't share.

05:32.800 --> 05:33.934
I said "Who?" Give me some
names.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.003
You kidding me, right?

05:36.036 --> 05:37.638
What was in the truck?

05:37.671 --> 05:39.039
Supposed to be TVs.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.140
WOMAN: Actually, it was a
shipment

05:40.173 --> 05:41.975
of medical supplies
for an African relief effort.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.111
- And you are?
- Sari Kinshasa.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.646
Executive Director,
Project Zambia Relief.

05:45.679 --> 05:46.914
Hey, I'm Don Eppes.

05:46.947 --> 05:48.782
Why don't you step over here,
tell me more.

05:48.816 --> 05:52.119
$2 million in HIV
and antimalaria drugs,

05:52.152 --> 05:53.987
and $50 million
locked in a safe.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.023
Money earmarked for micro-loans

05:56.056 --> 05:57.991
to revitalize
the Zambian economy.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.527
$50 million U.S. dollars?

05:59.560 --> 06:00.894
They have also kidnapped

06:00.928 --> 06:03.063
two of my people
accompanying the shipment.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.032
Okay, why would they do that?

06:05.065 --> 06:07.367
Because one of them
can open the safe.

06:15.075 --> 06:19.980
SARI: Dr. Daniel Matthews is
married, has two children.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.482
He volunteered

06:21.515 --> 06:23.116
for Project Zambia Relief
last summer.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.885
DAVID: Yeah, he's new
to the organization.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.754
Prior to this,
he was trying to raise money

06:26.787 --> 06:28.822
for a pediatric clinic
for illegal immigrants.

06:28.856 --> 06:32.192
Gwen Owen-- known
her for 11 years.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.662
She owned her own
architecture firm

06:34.695 --> 06:38.165
and sold it to devote her life
to helping African children.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.200
She designs clinics and schools.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.202
LIZ: Owen could be
experiencing burnout.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.037
You know what I mean,
looking for some

06:44.071 --> 06:46.740
compensation for sacrificing
her life and career.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.676
It had to be an inside job.
The robbers knew the route.

06:48.709 --> 06:49.810
They knew where to find

06:49.843 --> 06:51.912
- the GPS unit on the truck...
- No, no, you're wrong.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.081
Those people wouldn't be
on that truck if I didn't

06:54.114 --> 06:57.150
trust them completely-- no, they
are dedicated aide workers.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.152
Ms. Kinshasa, you have to
understand, this is what we do.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.821
Okay, we know what we're doing.

07:00.854 --> 07:01.622
But Dan and Gwen

07:01.655 --> 07:02.623
weren't the only
people with access

07:02.656 --> 07:03.957
- to that information.
- We're aware of that.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.494
You've been a supervisor

07:06.527 --> 07:09.697
for Canyon Hawk Security
for only two years.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.699
Yeah, you got me.
Only two years.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.801
Guess that means I did it.

07:13.834 --> 07:17.471
Would you like
to make a statement?

07:17.505 --> 07:19.740
What do they do to you people
when you join the Bureau,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.475
surgically remove
your sense of sarcasm?

07:21.509 --> 07:22.876
You lost a $50 million shipment.

07:22.910 --> 07:24.778
You got two people
kidnapped.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.213
So if I was you,

07:26.246 --> 07:29.182
I would choose a better time
to hone my comedy routine.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.584
(elevator bell dings)

07:30.618 --> 07:32.820
Well, the city
wants to declare

07:32.853 --> 07:34.187
the building
as a landmark.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.723
But CalSci wants
to demolish it,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.157
so I figured it's
the kind of thing

07:37.190 --> 07:38.792
you used to handle
all the time.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.161
Well, I'd be happy to look at
the plans,

07:41.194 --> 07:42.129
if you think that would help.

07:42.162 --> 07:42.830
- Yeah, yeah, thanks.
- Oh, you know what?

07:42.863 --> 07:45.232
I think something's going on.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.034
Oh, yeah. I don't think he
has time for lunch today.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.201
I think you're right.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.870
Listen, we've got
a hijacked truck

07:49.903 --> 07:50.971
we've got to find
before it leaves L.A.

07:51.004 --> 07:52.205
A truck? What kind of truck?

07:52.239 --> 07:53.874
Relief supplies for Zambia.

07:53.907 --> 07:56.043
It was, like, $2 million
in drugs, $50 million in cash.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.178
That's a fraction of what
we should be sending them, huh?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.548
They kidnapped two people
that they're probably torturing

08:00.581 --> 08:02.082
to get at the money, so...

08:02.115 --> 08:03.684
I can narrow down
some escape routes.

08:03.717 --> 08:04.885
- There's an application...
- Yeah, that's great.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.755
Why don't you just
use my desk, okay?

08:07.788 --> 08:09.523
(clears throat)

08:09.557 --> 08:11.091
Well, looks like
I'm eating alone.

08:11.124 --> 08:13.126
Well, actually, uh,
I could use your help.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.162
You're more familiar with
the L.A. landscape than I am.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.830
All right.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.065
Grab that-- you have a pen?

08:18.098 --> 08:19.867
Yes, I'm never
without one.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.538
If you try to burn it open
with a plasma cutter,

08:24.572 --> 08:26.006
there's a lining of toxic

08:26.039 --> 08:27.708
material
in the safe wall

08:27.741 --> 08:29.710
that will release poisonous gas.

08:29.743 --> 08:31.945
So they knew that and that's
why they took Matthews and Owen.

08:31.979 --> 08:34.915
It's not just the money
that's important.

08:34.948 --> 08:38.786
There are over 700,000
AIDS-related orphans in Zambia.

08:38.819 --> 08:41.321
Malaria kills
thousands every year.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.389
If the drugs are lost,

08:42.422 --> 08:44.725
it could take six months
to a year to replace them.

08:44.758 --> 08:47.327
About the money, why not just
wire it from bank to bank?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.162
That's not secure
in most areas.

08:49.196 --> 08:51.632
And besides, U.S. currency
gives you more leverage.

08:51.665 --> 08:54.568
It's become a standard
of value, like gold.

08:54.602 --> 08:56.269
Moving cash
overseas is common.

08:56.303 --> 08:57.805
COLBY:
It's too early to be sure,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.840
but my guess is the security
company's clean.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.942
Yeah, well, we better do
a deep background, anyway.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.977
But we gotta be focusing
on where that truck is.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.614
We already have the airports and
the harbor under surveillance.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.881
And all major freeways
in and out

09:07.915 --> 09:09.883
of the city
are being watched by CHP.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.185
But there's got to be literally
hundreds of routes

09:12.219 --> 09:13.286
out of the city.

09:13.320 --> 09:14.888
CHARLIE: Okay, so we put
together a preliminary list.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.323
You mind putting
up the map, David?

09:16.356 --> 09:17.625
Wow, that was fast.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.992
Well, again,
it's preliminary.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.894
We figure time
is of the essence.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.796
- Yes, absolutely.
- Great, well...

09:22.830 --> 09:25.866
the math we're using here
is called Dijkstra's algorithm,

09:25.899 --> 09:27.668
which is
a greedy algorithm.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.869
"Greedy" simply meaning

09:28.902 --> 09:31.605
that it picks
the highest values first.

09:31.639 --> 09:33.974
So it's like when
you make change...

09:34.007 --> 09:36.744
you pick the smallest
number of coins.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.245
It's an instinctive algorithm

09:38.278 --> 09:40.748
that we all use without even
thinking about it.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.883
So for 41 cents,
you start with a quarter,

09:42.916 --> 09:44.384
then a dime and so on.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.019
Dijkstra's algorithm finds

09:46.053 --> 09:47.955
the quickest path
between points.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.257
Now, instead of coins,
think of pure values.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.325
The algorithm
chooses the routes

09:52.359 --> 09:53.927
with the higher values:

09:53.961 --> 09:55.963
shorter distance,
greater speed,

09:55.996 --> 09:57.998
fewer traffic lights and turns.

09:58.031 --> 10:00.801
Online mapping sites
and car navigation systems,

10:00.834 --> 10:02.102
they use Dijkstra's algorithm

10:02.135 --> 10:03.904
to calculate directions.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.138
And we know
how well they work.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.339
CHARLIE:
So we've mapped out

10:06.373 --> 10:08.041
seven likely escape points

10:08.075 --> 10:09.042
for getting out of this city.

10:09.076 --> 10:10.978
Now, of course, I'm going
to need more data.

10:11.011 --> 10:12.312
There are a lot of variables.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.682
ALAN: You know, like, overpass
heights,

10:14.715 --> 10:16.116
bridge weight capacities,

10:16.149 --> 10:19.052
the road widths, traffic flow...

10:19.086 --> 10:21.288
So to narrow down
the possibilities,

10:21.321 --> 10:24.992
I'm going to combine branched
flow with heuristic procedures

10:25.025 --> 10:27.027
and create
sort of an, uh,

10:27.060 --> 10:28.361
an "escape" math, if you will.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.263
It should be coming
up right now.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.372
All right, good.

10:39.406 --> 10:40.841
- Let's go check it out.
- Great.

10:40.874 --> 10:41.842
All right.

10:44.111 --> 10:46.279
Hey, how you doing? I'm Charlie.
Sari Kinshasa.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.815
And I'm Alan.

10:47.848 --> 10:48.982
Hello.

10:49.016 --> 10:50.350
You're FBI agents?

10:50.383 --> 10:51.719
I'm an FBI consultant.

10:51.752 --> 10:54.021
I'm an FBI dad.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.055
(gentle laugh)

10:59.059 --> 11:01.161
(indistinct radio transmission)

11:03.263 --> 11:06.033
All right, you guys take
the first route, all right?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.434
And Colby,
we'll take the second...

11:07.467 --> 11:09.703
Agent Eppes.

11:09.737 --> 11:10.938
I understand
you're working

11:10.971 --> 11:12.305
a truck hijacking--
Zambian Relief.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.074
Yeah. Who are you?

11:14.107 --> 11:15.142
Uh, Michael Shannon.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.410
That $50 million you're looking
for belongs to me.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.312
How do you figure that?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.148
Mr. Shannon here
is a vulture fund investor.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.082
I don't like that term.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.184
Ms. Kinshasa may not agree with
what I do,

11:24.217 --> 11:25.919
but it is a legitimate
financial venture.

11:25.953 --> 11:26.954
When poor countries

11:26.987 --> 11:29.289
get behind on paying back
international loans,

11:29.322 --> 11:31.024
vulture fund
investors buy

11:31.058 --> 11:32.993
the bad loans
for pennies on the dollar.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.996
I bought over $60 million
in Zambian debt last year.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.065
For only three million.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.000
Then the U.S. forgave
the Zambian loan

11:40.033 --> 11:41.168
to help in our
relief efforts.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.771
You sued for the full amount,

11:43.804 --> 11:45.438
even though Zambia offered to
pay you back your money.

11:45.472 --> 11:46.940
Why should I settle
for $3 million

11:46.974 --> 11:48.108
when I have
a court order

11:48.141 --> 11:49.509
that says I have
a right to $60 million?

11:49.542 --> 11:50.878
Now, Agent Eppes,

11:50.911 --> 11:52.813
if and when
you find that money,

11:52.846 --> 11:54.047
it's mine.

11:55.515 --> 11:57.484
DAVID: I hope Charlie's escape
math works.

11:57.517 --> 11:59.286
We got to find
these guys and fast.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.520
Yeah. Four years
in the Bureau,

12:00.553 --> 12:01.989
and I still can't believe

12:02.022 --> 12:03.791
what some people are capable of.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.760
Stealing money and medicine from
starving people?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.128
Yeah. It boggles the mind.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.429
Unreal.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.832
How are you adjusting
to L.A.?

12:11.865 --> 12:13.867
It's all right.

12:13.901 --> 12:17.504
Someone once told me it's like
New Jersey with palm trees.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.206
(laughs)

12:19.239 --> 12:21.441
To be honest,
it's not that far off.

12:21.474 --> 12:23.276
Yeah, it helps
to know a local.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.378
Uh, somebody to show you
the good restaurants,

12:25.412 --> 12:27.047
how to avoid
rush hour traffic.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.049
Yeah, yeah.
Don's always trying to get me

12:29.082 --> 12:30.951
to take Venice
instead of the 10.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.888
Notice Don's taking an interest.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.423
Yeah, I mean, I guess

12:36.456 --> 12:38.525
he's helped me
get my footing out here.

12:38.558 --> 12:41.128
Yeah. Kind of like how
he helped Colby and me

12:41.161 --> 12:43.163
when, uh, we first
showed up.

12:43.196 --> 12:45.298
What are you saying?

12:45.332 --> 12:47.200
Hmm?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.568
What are you saying?

12:48.601 --> 12:50.971
Nothing.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.973
All right.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.441
Cool.

12:54.474 --> 12:57.110
COLBY:
So, we get that money back,

12:57.144 --> 12:59.479
we really have to give it
to the vulture fund guy?

12:59.512 --> 13:02.115
Yeah, well, you know,
it's kind of out of our hands.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.284
All right,
you know,

13:04.317 --> 13:05.986
I say
the security company's clean.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.055
We just got
to take a good hard look

13:08.088 --> 13:09.289
at this Project Zambia staff.

13:09.322 --> 13:10.523
Nah. Come on, man.

13:10.557 --> 13:13.160
How can you not trust people
who are working to help orphans?

13:13.193 --> 13:14.427
Well, same way
you don't trust anybody.

13:14.461 --> 13:15.863
Ah, so you think
Sari Kinshasa

13:15.896 --> 13:17.064
just doesn't know her people

13:17.097 --> 13:18.265
as well as she thinks she does?

13:18.298 --> 13:20.500
Well, how well does anyone
know who they're working with?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.070
Mm. The way I see it,
you got a team,

13:23.103 --> 13:24.271
you got to trust 'em.

13:24.304 --> 13:26.406
That's just the way it works.

13:46.526 --> 13:48.896
(quietly):
You know what? I got something.

13:48.929 --> 13:49.997
DAVID (over radio):
Copy that.

13:56.636 --> 13:58.538
(whimpering quietly)

13:58.571 --> 14:00.540
Hey, I got them.

14:00.573 --> 14:02.475
Copy that, Liz. Where are you?

14:02.509 --> 14:03.343
MAN:
We got you...

14:03.376 --> 14:05.879
...babe. (laughs)

14:13.921 --> 14:14.888
(laughing)

14:14.922 --> 14:16.256
Who the hell are you?

14:18.325 --> 14:19.960
A Fed, huh?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.129
How did you find us?

14:24.231 --> 14:26.066
FBI! Drop your weapons!

14:26.099 --> 14:27.968
(gunshots)

14:28.001 --> 14:28.936
Liz, move!

14:28.969 --> 14:30.971
(automatic gunfire)

14:33.473 --> 14:36.509
(engine starting,
gears grinding)

14:40.013 --> 14:40.880
Drop your weapon!

14:43.350 --> 14:44.651
Put it on the ground, now!

14:44.684 --> 14:46.586
Freeze! FBI!

14:46.619 --> 14:48.188
You, drop it right now!

14:48.221 --> 14:50.557
FBI! Get on the
damn ground!

14:50.590 --> 14:53.093
DAVID: Heist crew got away with
the truck.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.062
We had air support
up in five minutes.

14:55.095 --> 14:56.930
Truck vanished, and
we would have caught it

14:56.964 --> 14:58.065
if it weren't
for these two.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.200
LIZ (over speaker): Let me make
something very clear.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.701
You interfered
with an FBI investigation.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.071
I shot at an armed felon.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.038
How's that interfering?

15:05.072 --> 15:06.706
Same story as the other one.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.476
They say Michael Shannon

15:09.509 --> 15:10.944
employed them

15:10.978 --> 15:12.379
- to get the money back.
- All right.

15:12.412 --> 15:13.947
Let's get the guy in here,
all right?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.051
Hey, Shannon.

15:18.085 --> 15:18.952
Agent Eppes.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.520
You had hired goons
tailing my agents?

15:20.553 --> 15:23.256
I have a perfect right
to recover my property.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.158
My employees have done
nothing wrong.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.493
I would like them released.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.495
Well, they helped
the suspects escape.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.629
You have no proof of that.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.664
Maybe they found the truck
the same way you guys did.

15:31.698 --> 15:33.733
I very much
doubt that.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.368
You get them out of here.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.538
I see them again,
you're all going to jail.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.707
COLBY: Focus primarily on this
area right here.

15:40.740 --> 15:42.142
DAVID:
Up to Pasadena?

15:42.175 --> 15:43.343
Uh, well, the good news is

15:43.376 --> 15:45.412
at least we know
that the truck is still

15:45.445 --> 15:46.546
in the L.A. area.

15:46.579 --> 15:49.749
And it was slipped past
the dragnet that LAPD set up.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.384
CHARLIE: But now we have a more
recent location.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.453
We also know that somebody else
is going after it.

15:53.486 --> 15:55.322
They told me
you saw Dan and Gwen.

15:55.355 --> 15:56.523
They are alive?

15:56.556 --> 15:58.058
DAVID: Yes, uh, that's... that's
correct.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.226
Though mercenaries hired

15:59.259 --> 16:00.994
by Michael Shannon--
they stepped in,

16:01.028 --> 16:02.029
and interfered.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.230
Yes, I heard.

16:03.263 --> 16:05.098
So, now what?

16:05.132 --> 16:07.000
(indistinct conversation)

16:10.770 --> 16:13.306
This is how you found them
the first time?

16:13.340 --> 16:16.276
Uh, yes, and now we have
a far richer data set

16:16.309 --> 16:17.244
from which
to work from.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.746
A heuristic way
of identifying optimum paths

16:19.779 --> 16:22.115
by which
to leave an area undetected.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.750
Wow. You understand this stuff?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.652
I'm an economist.
I get the basics.

16:25.685 --> 16:29.489
Agent Granger,
in your best judgment,

16:29.522 --> 16:32.459
what is going to happen
to Dan and Gwen?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.427
Well, it would
really depend

16:34.461 --> 16:36.763
on what they've seen and heard,
and whether or not

16:36.796 --> 16:39.099
they're willing to give up
the code to the safe.

16:39.132 --> 16:43.203
I don't think
they'll give it up.

16:43.236 --> 16:44.637
The medicine on
that truck--

16:44.671 --> 16:46.639
malaria,
cholera treatments,

16:46.673 --> 16:48.741
vaccines-- can save thousands
of children

16:48.775 --> 16:51.444
who will otherwise die.

16:51.478 --> 16:53.380
The money--
I mean, this $50 million--

16:53.413 --> 16:56.483
it's a lot, but it's really not
even a drop in the bucket.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.452
A drop is all it takes
to prime a pump.

17:01.288 --> 17:03.123
You're talking
about micro credit.

17:03.156 --> 17:04.557
SARI:
Yes, people get

17:04.591 --> 17:06.826
tiny loans
to start small businesses.

17:06.859 --> 17:09.729
Knitting, growing vegetables,
making furniture.

17:09.762 --> 17:14.701
You know, uh, the efficiency
of micro credit is...

17:14.734 --> 17:16.769
is much like the
capillary action

17:16.803 --> 17:18.771
of a paper towel
absorbing liquid.

17:18.805 --> 17:22.242
You see, the economic
structure of a community

17:22.275 --> 17:24.777
is like the woven fabric
of a paper towel.

17:24.811 --> 17:28.548
People interconnected
by commerce.

17:28.581 --> 17:32.652
The difference is, as money
enters the fabric of economy,

17:32.685 --> 17:34.821
it actually creates more money.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.790
SARI: Say a woman has money to
buy material.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.092
She sells clothing
at the market.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.761
The woman then brings back
the cash to her village.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.397
She buys food and other
essentials for her family.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.733
CHARLIE: Money gets absorbed,
spreads around,

17:46.766 --> 17:49.436
so more people have cash
to spend and invest.

17:49.469 --> 17:50.737
SARI: Yes, it's worked in
Ethiopia,

17:50.770 --> 17:52.505
Bangladesh, Mozambique.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.641
Loans as little as $100

17:54.674 --> 17:56.309
to $500, and 97%

17:56.343 --> 17:58.245
- repaid.
- COLBY: 97%?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.213
Wow. That's so hard to believe.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.848
CHARLIE:
Why are capitalists

18:01.881 --> 18:04.684
so surprised
that capitalism works?

18:04.717 --> 18:05.852
Look.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.655
These are some of the people

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
this shipment

18:10.223 --> 18:12.225
is intended for.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.593
Two of these children...

18:14.894 --> 18:17.197
...have died of malaria
in the past month.

18:17.230 --> 18:20.800
But we can save others
if we get the truck back.

18:22.902 --> 18:26.239
Sari... may I please

18:26.273 --> 18:28.241
have one of
these photos?

18:28.275 --> 18:29.642
Of course.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.880
(door opens)

18:33.913 --> 18:35.415
Hey.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.817
What's up? What's that?

18:37.850 --> 18:39.819
I don't know.
It was lying on the floor

18:39.852 --> 18:41.788
when I came down,
and it was broken.

18:41.821 --> 18:43.590
What do you think--
maybe Mom's ghost?

18:43.623 --> 18:44.757
(laughs)

18:44.791 --> 18:45.725
No, she loved this vase.

18:45.758 --> 18:49.262
Otherwise, I'd just
throw the pieces away.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.464
So, uh, what's up?

18:51.498 --> 18:52.799
What are you doing?

18:52.832 --> 18:54.834
Ah, you know, just
work, work, work.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.704
You still seeing the,
uh, therapist?

18:57.737 --> 18:58.871
How's that going?

18:58.905 --> 19:00.340
Uh, it's going all right.

19:00.373 --> 19:01.741
He actually asked me to see

19:01.774 --> 19:03.610
if Charlie would come in
for a session.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.378
Hmm. That sounds great.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.214
Yeah? Why is that?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.382
Well, so you can
talk about stuff

19:09.416 --> 19:10.850
that, uh, you never
talk about.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.652
You know, stuff that, uh,

19:12.685 --> 19:13.953
bothers you.

19:13.986 --> 19:14.921
I don't know.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.756
What's the point?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.358
We were kids, you know?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.826
And you're still
fighting like kids.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.494
Come on, you're grown up.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.896
Get over this stuff, and...

19:23.930 --> 19:25.965
start fighting like adults.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.634
(door opens)

19:27.667 --> 19:29.636
Oh, hey.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.571
So, I will have

19:31.604 --> 19:33.906
new search parameters for you
in, like, a couple hours.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.875
- Is that cool?
- Yeah, that's so great. Thanks.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.511
Ooh, I, uh... I forgot.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.846
I left the sprinkler on
in the backyard.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.348
Sprinklers on at night?

19:41.381 --> 19:42.582
(Don laughs)

19:42.615 --> 19:44.684
You got me.

19:44.717 --> 19:46.586
What's happening?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.421
Hey, listen, um, my
therapist asked me

19:48.455 --> 19:51.424
to ask you if you'd come in
for a session.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.426
You know?

19:53.460 --> 19:55.962
Like, I don't know,
talk about stuff.

19:55.995 --> 19:57.997
Um... any stuff in particular?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.399
You know,
just things.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.501
I mean, whatever...
you know.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.936
I don't know.

20:03.970 --> 20:06.773
Yeah, I mean, it's not exactly
comfortable for me, either.

20:06.806 --> 20:10.577
Well, uh... it's your therapy.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.679
It's not my therapy.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.382
Maybe we should just
keep it that way.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.959
Sheriff's got

20:26.993 --> 20:29.262
a tip on a tractor-trailer
parked back here.

20:29.296 --> 20:30.930
Yeah?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.999
Looks like something big
drove through here recently.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.835
What, did you learn big rig
tracking back in Quantico?

20:35.868 --> 20:37.937
From my great-grandfather.

20:37.970 --> 20:40.473
You know,
I'm 1/16 Cherokee.

20:40.507 --> 20:41.908
Seriously?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.876
The Cherokee part, yeah.

20:43.910 --> 20:45.912
The tracking part, no.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.780
(groaning
in distance)

20:47.814 --> 20:48.981
Hey, what was that?

20:49.015 --> 20:50.983
Probably some
homeless guy.

20:51.017 --> 20:52.885
Wait a minute, that looks like
(coughing)

20:52.919 --> 20:54.387
Daniel Matthews.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.755
COLBY:
Dr. Matthews?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.757
LIZ:
Okay.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.058
(groaning)
Gwen.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.993
They still have Gwen.

21:08.067 --> 21:09.869
COLBY: So what happened, Dr.
Matthews?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.605
They beat me-- they wanted
the code to the safe.

21:12.639 --> 21:14.807
You should've just told them.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.377
No way-- getting that
funding was so hard.

21:17.410 --> 21:18.778
(coughing)

21:18.811 --> 21:21.781
They kept hitting me...
I passed out.

21:21.814 --> 21:25.318
When I came to, they were
throwing me from the truck.

21:25.352 --> 21:27.854
Do you have any idea why?

21:27.887 --> 21:28.855
Not sure.

21:28.888 --> 21:30.890
I was pretty out of it.
(distant sirens wailing)

21:30.923 --> 21:33.092
I think Gwen said
she knew the code,

21:33.125 --> 21:35.995
but she'd only tell them
if they let me go.

21:36.028 --> 21:39.566
All right, we're gonna get you
transported out of here, okay?

21:39.599 --> 21:40.700
COLBY:
All right, get LAPD

21:40.733 --> 21:43.370
looking for a woman that matches
Gwen Owen's description.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.071
By now, they probably have
the safe open and probably

21:45.104 --> 21:46.673
- thrown her out.
- No!

21:46.706 --> 21:49.041
Gwen lied.

21:49.075 --> 21:50.577
She was trying to save me...

21:52.044 --> 21:53.580
...and save the money.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.083
She doesn't know the combination
to the safe.

21:57.116 --> 21:58.585
No.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.487
I do.

22:00.520 --> 22:01.588
Just me.

22:03.990 --> 22:06.759
Robbers knew about the
drugs, but not the money.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.060
We think they
got a tip

22:08.094 --> 22:09.729
from one of the medical
supply companies.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.432
So Colby's talking to
an LAPD undercover

22:12.465 --> 22:14.033
who works black
market drug sales.

22:14.066 --> 22:16.035
Yeah,
that's a good idea.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.003
Don...

22:17.036 --> 22:18.971
You know how I told you
people would notice

22:19.005 --> 22:20.673
what's going
on with us?

22:20.707 --> 22:22.108
They have.

22:22.141 --> 22:24.010
So, what?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.012
It's not exactly getting in
the way of the work, right?

22:28.147 --> 22:32.919
I don't want to compromise
my career.

22:36.088 --> 22:38.858
Especially if, in six months,
you're going to be moving on.

22:38.891 --> 22:40.026
Come on, that is so,

22:40.059 --> 22:41.060
that is not fair.

22:41.093 --> 22:42.194
Look, you're right.

22:42.228 --> 22:44.030
I-I don't even know what
I'll be thinking in six months.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.171
Look, I... I'm
crazy about you.

22:52.204 --> 22:56.409
The problem is...
rumors and speculation

22:56.443 --> 23:00.413
make people think things
aren't on the up-and-up.

23:00.447 --> 23:02.549
All right, so...

23:02.582 --> 23:05.084
I mean, you want
to tell them?

23:05.117 --> 23:08.921
You ready for that?

23:08.955 --> 23:10.857
(sighs)

23:13.125 --> 23:15.127
Just don't be
using my name.

23:15.161 --> 23:17.930
LAPD wouldn't be thrilled
sharing info with the Feds.

23:17.964 --> 23:19.632
Understood.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.868
Bunch of stuff was
supposed to hit the market

23:21.901 --> 23:24.804
sometime this week: morphine,
Valium, antibiotics, vaccines.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.739
- Hasn't shown up yet.
- Yeah, well,

23:26.773 --> 23:28.174
who buys black market
medications?

23:28.207 --> 23:31.210
Doctors, clinics,
shady drug stores.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.013
Except vaccines, they
don't move locally.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.082
Yeah, not much malaria
or cholera in L.A., huh?

23:36.115 --> 23:37.917
Not yet at least.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.587
Vaccines go to dealers who
smuggle them over the border.

23:40.620 --> 23:43.490
Yeah, well, in your experience,
who do we look at for this?

23:43.523 --> 23:46.693
Guys who jack drug shipments
tend to work off info

23:46.726 --> 23:48.761
they get out of the companies
that ship the stuff.

23:48.795 --> 23:50.229
(door opens)
Oh, hey.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.064
- What's up?
- What are you doing here?

23:52.098 --> 23:54.767
Hi, Charlie.

23:54.801 --> 23:56.102
Hey, Charlie, you know,

23:56.135 --> 23:57.970
I was looking through
some old photos and, uh,

23:58.004 --> 23:59.906
look what I found.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.146
Yeah.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.115
You've been speaking with Don.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.349
Well, he-he told me

24:10.382 --> 24:12.218
that his therapist wants you
to come to one of his sessions.

24:12.251 --> 24:13.720
Yeah, well, you know,

24:13.753 --> 24:16.188
he and I kinda
get along okay now.

24:16.222 --> 24:18.124
What, you think if
you talk things out,

24:18.157 --> 24:19.091
you wouldn't get along anymore?

24:19.125 --> 24:19.892
Yeah.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.260
It's possible.

24:21.293 --> 24:23.630
No, not at all.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.231
You know what, Dad?

24:25.264 --> 24:27.099
He and I...

24:27.133 --> 24:30.169
have hit an equilibrium.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.772
And... I help him
with his work

24:32.805 --> 24:35.141
and he... lets me...

24:35.174 --> 24:36.108
Lets you?!

24:36.142 --> 24:37.276
Well...

24:37.309 --> 24:38.811
He let's you do what?

24:38.845 --> 24:42.014
He lets me...
hang around him.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.651
I'm still the little brother.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.721
You know, the day
this photo was taken--

24:48.755 --> 24:51.624
not one of our
family's best.

24:51.658 --> 24:55.294
It's just that he has, uh...
he has things on his mind and...

24:55.327 --> 24:57.163
so why not talk about it?

24:59.298 --> 25:02.134
He has no idea
what really went on that day.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.171
I don't think you do either.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.039
Well, I-I didn't then.

25:07.073 --> 25:08.975
But I think I managed
to figure it out.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.247
We looked at the
companies that provided

25:15.281 --> 25:16.182
the stock on the truck;

25:16.215 --> 25:16.849
we checked through
their employee lists.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.585
And came up with this guy--

25:18.618 --> 25:21.320
Frank Tibbet.
Last time I saw him,

25:21.353 --> 25:22.254
he was pointing a gun at Liz.

25:22.288 --> 25:24.557
COLBY: Up until two
weeks ago, he worked

25:24.591 --> 25:25.958
for a drug packing company.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.894
He was released from state
prison a year ago--

25:27.927 --> 25:28.895
armed robbery.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.897
Known associate of...

25:30.930 --> 25:34.734
It's, uh... Vincent Kagan.

25:34.767 --> 25:36.102
That's the other guy
Liz and I met.

25:36.135 --> 25:38.037
Now, rounding out
the gang...

25:38.070 --> 25:41.574
Vincent's brothers
Anthony and Zack.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.242
These guys are
a high-end crew

25:43.275 --> 25:45.745
that specialize in
jacking pharmaceuticals.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.346
DAVID: Vincent's a suspect in
the shooting death

25:47.379 --> 25:49.882
of a guard protecting
a shipment of oxycontin.

25:49.916 --> 25:53.586
The guard wouldn't give up the
code to open the security door.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.187
Which doesn't bode well
for Gwen Owen.

25:55.221 --> 25:55.755
LIZ:
Hey, guys.

25:55.788 --> 25:57.223
CHP just got a report

25:57.256 --> 25:58.958
of a truck matching
the stolen one

25:58.991 --> 26:00.359
at a truck stop.

26:00.392 --> 26:01.694
When they got there,
it was already gone.

26:01.728 --> 26:02.995
All right, good.
Why don't you guys

26:03.029 --> 26:03.996
check that out,
all right?

26:06.398 --> 26:08.167
Hey, so, Don,

26:08.200 --> 26:10.302
I've worked out new possible
escape routes based now

26:10.336 --> 26:11.638
on where Dr. Matthews was found.

26:11.671 --> 26:12.304
Great.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.239
I'll check them out, thanks.

26:13.272 --> 26:15.942
Hey, so you know
that thing you asked me...

26:15.975 --> 26:17.243
uh, to do?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.345
Yeah, it's, uh...
it's all right, don't worry

26:19.378 --> 26:20.146
about it.

26:20.179 --> 26:20.813
I'll do it.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.148
I'll go.

26:22.181 --> 26:23.315
Just let me know when.

26:23.349 --> 26:25.685
I'll be there.

26:30.322 --> 26:30.790
(truck horn blaring)

26:40.667 --> 26:42.234
(pneumatic tools whirring)

26:46.238 --> 26:47.874
(water spraying)

26:47.907 --> 26:49.976
DAVID:
Bounty hunters. Again.

26:50.009 --> 26:50.977
You know what?

26:51.010 --> 26:52.211
I haven't yet had

26:52.244 --> 26:54.213
the privilege of meeting
those gentlemen.

26:54.246 --> 26:56.315
You're right.

26:58.685 --> 27:01.053
Hey, I hear you guys are
looking for a rig.

27:01.087 --> 27:02.421
Peterbilt 379.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.356
Might be.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.292
Are you or not?

27:06.325 --> 27:08.427
Great Dane trailer

27:08.460 --> 27:09.962
with a sliding
tandem axle?

27:09.996 --> 27:11.197
That be the one.

27:11.230 --> 27:12.832
Saw it take off on the 10 East

27:12.865 --> 27:14.166
a little while ago.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.334
Hey, there, ladies.

27:15.367 --> 27:17.670
How you doing?
Hands on your head.

27:17.704 --> 27:18.705
(laughing)
Turn around.

27:18.738 --> 27:20.306
Come on, man.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.208
We're both on the same side,
right?

27:22.241 --> 27:23.442
How about a little
team spirit?

27:23.475 --> 27:25.411
Yeah, don't get
your feelings hurt

27:25.444 --> 27:26.378
if we say, "no," all right?

27:26.412 --> 27:29.015
Hey, you got nothin'
to arrest us for, man.

27:29.048 --> 27:30.349
Well, how'd you
wind up here?

27:30.382 --> 27:31.751
Following us again?

27:31.784 --> 27:34.253
No, not this time--
we put a reward

27:34.286 --> 27:35.688
out on the Internet--
got some hits.

27:35.722 --> 27:38.691
Guy said he saw
the truck here.

27:38.725 --> 27:40.226
You want to share some of those
tips with us, buddy?

27:40.259 --> 27:42.895
Oh, well, now, that's our info,
isn't it?

27:42.929 --> 27:44.330
We paid good money
for it.

27:44.363 --> 27:47.700
FBI's too cheap to post
a reward, well...

27:47.734 --> 27:49.335
that's not really our problem.

27:49.368 --> 27:50.770
(grunts)

27:50.803 --> 27:52.772
Yeah, actually,
that is your problem.

27:52.805 --> 27:53.840
Let's go.

28:00.312 --> 28:03.983
Once again, we haven't
broken any laws.

28:04.016 --> 28:05.284
My employees have done
nothing wrong.

28:05.317 --> 28:07.720
I would like to have them
released.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.888
Oh, yeah, well,
you know,

28:08.921 --> 28:10.456
I'd like to pitch
for the Yankees.

28:10.489 --> 28:12.058
But what's gonna happen is
you're gonna order your men

28:12.091 --> 28:12.892
to tell me what they know.

28:12.925 --> 28:15.327
Only if you
and your superiors sign

28:15.361 --> 28:16.495
a paper ensuring

28:16.528 --> 28:18.464
that if and when the
money is recovered,

28:18.497 --> 28:20.733
it will be delivered to me.

28:20.767 --> 28:21.868
Come here.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.035
Come on.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.270
I want to show you something.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.978
That's Gwen Owen.

28:32.011 --> 28:34.781
She was tortured for the
combination to the safe

28:34.814 --> 28:36.482
that has "your"
money in it.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.484
She risked her life
to save a guy she works with.

28:38.517 --> 28:41.387
I'm hoping maybe
you'll understand

28:41.420 --> 28:43.856
why my only concern
is finding her alive

28:43.890 --> 28:45.792
and getting the supplies
to those kids.

28:47.927 --> 28:51.197
All right, we'll tell you
everything that we know.

28:51.230 --> 28:52.832
But...

28:52.865 --> 28:55.167
I'm still going
to get my money back.

28:55.201 --> 28:56.869
Uh, yeah, well...

28:56.903 --> 28:58.304
you're going to do it
with a court order.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.471
So, I'm telling you
this right now:

28:59.505 --> 29:02.041
if me or any of my people
see any of your guys again,

29:02.074 --> 29:04.844
I'm gonna bust your ass
for obstruction of justice.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.013
You understand that?

29:21.828 --> 29:23.796
You know,
in traffic engineering,

29:23.830 --> 29:25.832
to assign traffic routes
and links,

29:25.865 --> 29:28.067
they use something called
network equilibrium conditions.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.502
And that occurs only
when someone cannot

29:30.536 --> 29:33.005
improve his travel time
by changing routes.

29:33.039 --> 29:36.042
Well, yeah, I've already
accounted for that, Dad,

29:36.075 --> 29:37.176
in this Frank-Wolfe
algorithm.

29:37.209 --> 29:38.544
But that's not
my problem.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.980
My problem is that
my analysis indicates

29:41.013 --> 29:43.482
that the truck should be
heading on this path here--

29:43.515 --> 29:44.984
see that?-- Eastbound.
Yeah.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.819
- Yeah.
- However, the FBI and the LAPD,

29:46.853 --> 29:48.287
they say it's not there.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.488
But you say it is.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.090
Within 96% probability.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.459
So what I did was I calculated
the orbital apogee

29:53.492 --> 29:55.561
and inclination
of eight spy satellites to see

29:55.594 --> 29:56.863
if they were in the right
place at the right time

29:56.896 --> 29:58.530
to take photos of the area.

29:58.564 --> 29:59.365
Mm-hmm. And?

29:59.398 --> 30:01.834
Lacrosse 5 was in the right
place

30:01.868 --> 30:04.070
and recorded seven different
types of imaging data.

30:04.103 --> 30:05.872
Nothing.

30:05.905 --> 30:08.107
Yeah, but, Charlie,
you're using escape math.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.610
What if that truck is
no longer trying to escape?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.479
(phone ringing)

30:13.512 --> 30:14.113
Yeah. Eppes.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.347
Hey!

30:15.381 --> 30:16.615
So the path I told you about--
the truck's gotta be there.

30:16.648 --> 30:19.085
Charlie, look, we had choppers
all over the place, all right?

30:19.118 --> 30:21.220
Once the truck leaves
the Los Angeles area,

30:21.253 --> 30:23.890
the number of roads
we have to search drastically

30:23.923 --> 30:25.524
reduces-- believe me,
the robbers know that.

30:25.557 --> 30:26.492
They know they'll be visible.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.159
So what are you saying,

30:27.193 --> 30:28.427
- they pulled off?
- Right.

30:28.460 --> 30:30.963
They must've stopped somewhere
on the outskirts of the city.

30:30.997 --> 30:33.065
That gives them time to open
the safe, to leave the truck

30:33.099 --> 30:35.101
and split up--
I think I can calculate

30:35.134 --> 30:37.970
the most likely area
along the truck's path ASAP.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.005
Yeah, all right,
that sounds good.

30:39.038 --> 30:41.073
Do what you can and get back
to me, all right?

30:41.107 --> 30:42.608
I'm going to head out.

30:58.424 --> 31:00.927
All right, we're striking out
here-- how about you guys?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.128
Nah, nothing.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.936
Don, I think
we got something.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.470
We have the car that
Matthews described.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.205
Crew has to be
hiding close by.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.141
(chattering indistinctly)

31:18.677 --> 31:20.612
LIZ:
Hello?

31:20.646 --> 31:22.014
(knocking on window)

31:22.048 --> 31:24.383
Oh, hey, um, I need some gas.

31:24.416 --> 31:25.584
My car's empty.

31:25.617 --> 31:27.586
I'll take this.

31:27.619 --> 31:29.388
(clears throat)

31:29.421 --> 31:30.556
Don't look at my hand.

31:30.589 --> 31:31.557
(door busts open)

31:31.590 --> 31:34.226
(shouting)

31:35.494 --> 31:36.562
Put your hands up!

31:38.497 --> 31:39.531
Get your hands
behind your back!

31:39.565 --> 31:41.233
Get them behind
your back right now!

31:41.267 --> 31:43.469
Listen, there's no sign
of Vincent Kagan.

31:43.502 --> 31:44.403
Where's that truck?

31:46.505 --> 31:48.340
Take them outside

31:48.374 --> 31:49.408
and just question
them separately.

31:49.441 --> 31:50.576
You, get up.

31:50.609 --> 31:52.144
Liz, come on, let's
get them outside.

31:52.178 --> 31:53.379
DON:
Oh, yeah? Come here.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.381
Come here. Get up.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.449
Sit down.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.651
I want to know where
that truck is.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.520
Listen, we got you
on armed robbery.

32:01.553 --> 32:02.588
If the woman dies,

32:02.621 --> 32:04.123
you are looking
at murder.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.724
All right, I get it.

32:05.757 --> 32:09.161
The truck is stashed
nearby.

32:09.195 --> 32:10.429
I don't know
where exactly.

32:10.462 --> 32:11.630
Come here.

32:13.565 --> 32:15.601
Tibbet just told me
the truck's going east.

32:15.634 --> 32:17.536
Zack says
the truck is still here.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.405
All right, so
who's lying?

32:26.278 --> 32:27.446
Hey, buddy, listen.

32:27.479 --> 32:29.748
We didn't find the truck--
we found the guys who stole it.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.183
One of them says it's near here.

32:31.217 --> 32:32.184
The other says
it's already out of the state.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.652
All right, uh, so...

32:33.685 --> 32:37.356
there's a classic logic puzzle
that kind of applies.

32:37.389 --> 32:38.690
Why don't you ask each guy

32:38.724 --> 32:41.193
where the other one will say
the truck is?

32:41.227 --> 32:42.494
Yeah, but one of them's
obviously lying.

32:42.528 --> 32:43.629
Well, yeah, exactly.

32:43.662 --> 32:45.431
One's lying,
one's telling the truth.

32:45.464 --> 32:46.432
Whatever either one says,

32:46.465 --> 32:48.534
the truck's going to be
in the opposite place.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.436
Yeah, yeah,
all right, all right, all right.

32:50.469 --> 32:52.371
I'm gonna call you back.
Liz, come here.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.107
All right, Charlie
just gave me an idea.

32:55.141 --> 32:56.275
We're gonna try
something a little weird.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.444
No, I told you
what I know.

32:58.477 --> 32:59.611
I'm trying to cooperate.

32:59.645 --> 33:01.047
Yeah, that's what
your buddy said.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.481
So what's he
going to tell us?

33:02.514 --> 33:03.649
Huh?

33:03.682 --> 33:06.052
Look, if he's playing ball,
he'll tell you the truth.

33:07.486 --> 33:09.155
The truck's halfway
through Arizona.

33:09.188 --> 33:10.289
ZACK:
Tibbet's cutting a deal?

33:10.322 --> 33:11.423
That's crazy; no way.

33:11.457 --> 33:12.124
Hey.

33:12.158 --> 33:12.924
He'll tell you the truck's gone

33:12.958 --> 33:14.293
because he's screwing
with you.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.294
What about you?
You screwing me?

33:15.327 --> 33:15.727
No.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.766
(auto dial beeping)

33:20.799 --> 33:22.468
(line ringing)

33:22.501 --> 33:25.237
All right, so both of 'em said
the other would say it's gone.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.039
Well, that means
it's still here.

33:27.073 --> 33:30.642
Look, you... you've got a choice
between "A" and "B."

33:30.676 --> 33:32.178
You've got two guys--

33:32.211 --> 33:34.413
both know who's right,
one of the two is lying--

33:34.446 --> 33:36.582
so by asking them
what the other one will say,

33:36.615 --> 33:38.484
you're going
to get the lie twice.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.252
Yeah, but the thing is, Charlie,
we're not finding it here.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.487
All right, I mean,
your stuff says one thing.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.288
Our eyes
are telling us

33:42.321 --> 33:44.823
something
completely different.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.359
What, we shouldn't
be looking for a truck.

33:47.393 --> 33:49.395
COLBY: Right, 'cause it doesn't
look like a truck anymore,

33:49.428 --> 33:50.729
but we need to look for
something that takes up

33:50.762 --> 33:52.764
the same amount of
space as the truck.

33:52.798 --> 33:53.399
Charlie, hold on.

33:53.432 --> 33:55.101
Just one second, hold on.

33:55.134 --> 33:57.203
Check this out.

33:57.236 --> 33:58.036
Right there.

33:58.070 --> 33:59.105
Yeah, wait a minute, we passed
that

33:59.138 --> 34:01.073
about a half a mile back.
That's a trailer park.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.242
LIZ:
You think it's tucked in

34:03.275 --> 34:04.743
beside one
of these double-wides?

34:04.776 --> 34:06.478
Yeah, I mean,
it's possible, right?

34:17.856 --> 34:19.525
DAVID:
Hey... guys.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.459
Take a look.

34:23.662 --> 34:24.563
This one's
a new arrival.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.465
Grass is still green.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.837
Guys.

34:33.572 --> 34:34.473
DAVID:
Yo, yo.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.575
DON (quietly):
Come here.

34:36.608 --> 34:39.578
(diesel engine starting)

34:39.611 --> 34:41.280
(backup alarm beeping)

34:45.717 --> 34:48.086
COLBY:
I don't know what his plan is,
but I guess we're backing him.

34:58.697 --> 35:01.133
(tires screeching)

35:02.634 --> 35:05.271
(siren bleeping)

35:06.505 --> 35:08.440
(tires screeching, Don shouting)

35:08.474 --> 35:09.375
Put your hands up
where I can see them!

35:09.408 --> 35:11.710
Keep them up!
I want to see those hands!

35:11.743 --> 35:13.445
Don't move.

35:13.479 --> 35:14.880
- Just relax, man.
- Let's go.

35:21.187 --> 35:23.622
- You guys all right?
- It's clear.

35:28.427 --> 35:29.395
Gwen Owen.

35:29.428 --> 35:30.429
Don Eppes
with the FBI.

35:30.462 --> 35:31.563
Okay, you're okay, we got you.

35:31.597 --> 35:32.631
I'm just going
to take this off.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.266
Okay, just
nice and easy.

35:34.300 --> 35:35.901
They didn't get the money.

35:35.934 --> 35:37.236
Yeah, good job.

35:37.269 --> 35:39.171
Let's get
those paramedics rolling.

35:39.205 --> 35:41.240
All right,
you're okay.

35:41.273 --> 35:42.208
(crying)

35:45.377 --> 35:46.345
This is better, right?

35:46.378 --> 35:47.346
(laughs)
It's an improvement.

35:47.379 --> 35:48.414
You look much,
much better.

35:48.447 --> 35:49.715
Thanks.

35:50.849 --> 35:53.585
SARI:
Gwen.

35:53.619 --> 35:54.586
GWEN:
Oh!

35:54.620 --> 35:56.522
Oh, it's good to see you.

36:00.659 --> 36:01.960
- Hi.
-(laughing): Hi.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.663
Those two went
through hell.

36:06.865 --> 36:09.167
All to get
your money back.

36:11.002 --> 36:12.338
SARI:
So, are you ready

36:12.371 --> 36:14.573
to get back to Africa?

36:14.606 --> 36:15.507
You know it.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.350
Hey, guys, hold on a second.

36:24.383 --> 36:25.351
Heads up.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.852
Ms. Kinshasa.

36:26.885 --> 36:29.288
Mr. Michael Shannon
has agreed

36:29.321 --> 36:30.322
to a settlement.

36:30.356 --> 36:31.690
He's giving up his claim

36:31.723 --> 36:33.392
to the $50 million
in exchange

36:33.425 --> 36:35.627
for three million
to cover his investment.

36:35.661 --> 36:36.895
That's right.

36:36.928 --> 36:39.231
And the rest goes to Zambia.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.532
All right.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.867
And the Grinch's heart
grew three sizes

36:41.900 --> 36:44.703
- that day.
- Yeah, what changed his mind?

36:44.736 --> 36:47.205
I think it was maybe
something one of you said.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.842
No, maybe it was
something he saw.

36:50.876 --> 36:53.412
Well... thank you.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.713
Thank you all.

36:56.047 --> 36:57.749
I'm gonna go
make some calls.

36:57.783 --> 36:58.717
Whoa, hold on,
actually.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.686
Listen, um,
I just want to say something.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.854
Guys, I know there's been
this, uh, talk going on,

37:02.888 --> 37:04.623
and I just want
to say in the name

37:04.656 --> 37:06.625
of full disclosure that, uh,

37:06.658 --> 37:09.695
Liz and I have, in fact,
been seeing each other.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.730
- Okay?
- Oh, God.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.532
Okay.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.367
There's another mystery solved.

37:15.401 --> 37:16.402
So any of you, uh,

37:16.435 --> 37:17.736
you guys got
anything to say,

37:17.769 --> 37:20.472
you can, uh,
you can say it to her.

37:20.506 --> 37:21.473
(laughs)

37:21.507 --> 37:22.808
(laughs)

37:22.841 --> 37:23.575
No problem.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.315
It was my
13th birthday

37:29.348 --> 37:33.719
and, uh, my dad was going
to take me and, uh...

37:33.752 --> 37:35.354
you know,
some of my friends camping.

37:35.387 --> 37:36.955
You know,
and, uh...

37:36.988 --> 37:38.824
and Charlie came with us.

37:38.857 --> 37:39.891
CHARLIE:
Okay,

37:39.925 --> 37:41.327
just for the record,

37:41.360 --> 37:42.761
you know, I didn't want to go.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.363
- You know, that was totally...
- Right.

37:44.396 --> 37:45.731
- Mom and Dad's idea.
- Anyway,

37:45.764 --> 37:47.699
you know, my dad takes
me aside and says

37:47.733 --> 37:49.701
that he's going
to keep an eye on my friends,

37:49.735 --> 37:51.670
and that this guy
is my responsibility.

37:51.703 --> 37:53.038
A special trip
with your buddies,

37:53.071 --> 37:55.507
- suddenly, you're a babysitter.
- Yeah.

37:55.541 --> 37:57.843
Exactly. Of course, you know,
I let him get lost

37:57.876 --> 37:59.445
and he's, he's missing for--

37:59.478 --> 38:01.847
it was at least 12 hours, right?

38:01.880 --> 38:03.615
I mean, it was sheriffs
and rangers

38:03.649 --> 38:05.684
and a whole search
and, and even my mom--

38:05.717 --> 38:07.486
she had to drive up.

38:07.519 --> 38:08.854
You know, she can't stop crying.

38:08.887 --> 38:09.955
She's blaming my dad.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.357
And how about you?

38:11.390 --> 38:13.792
I was supposed
to take care of him.

38:13.825 --> 38:15.627
And how did that
make you really feel?

38:18.664 --> 38:21.066
Yeah, you know,
I was pissed off, I guess.

38:21.099 --> 38:22.668
I mean,

38:22.701 --> 38:23.835
but what?
It was my fault, you know.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.103
No, it wasn't.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.440
- I'm sorry-- no, it wasn't.
- Well, it was.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.475
CHARLIE:
You shouldn't feel bad.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.610
- No.
- Well, I didn't get lost.

38:31.643 --> 38:32.778
What are you talking about?

38:32.811 --> 38:34.380
I knew
you didn't want me there--

38:34.413 --> 38:35.814
you made it pretty
obvious-- so I decided

38:35.847 --> 38:37.516
- to walk home.
- Oh, you decided

38:37.549 --> 38:38.650
to walk home?

38:38.684 --> 38:40.085
- Yeah.
- To Pasadena?

38:40.118 --> 38:41.987
That is so...

38:42.020 --> 38:43.755
I mean, unbelievable.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.357
Wha...?

38:45.391 --> 38:46.958
- I was responsible for you.
- I know.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.661
I know, but you were
13 years old.

38:49.695 --> 38:52.431
- So what?
- So get over yourself.

38:55.066 --> 38:57.836
Hmm...

38:57.869 --> 39:00.005
Why would you do that?

39:00.038 --> 39:03.108
Because... you didn't
want me around.

39:03.141 --> 39:04.410
You never wanted
me around.

39:04.443 --> 39:05.644
Ah, Charlie, that's not true.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.846
- You never wanted me around.
- Yes, it is true.

39:07.879 --> 39:08.380
No, Charlie,

39:08.414 --> 39:09.114
look, it's not true.

39:09.147 --> 39:10.048
Are you kidding?
You don't think

39:10.081 --> 39:10.882
I ever noticed the
looks you would give me?

39:10.916 --> 39:12.718
What looks? The rolling the
eyes...

39:12.751 --> 39:13.719
No, it is not true

39:13.752 --> 39:15.053
because it's always about you.

39:15.086 --> 39:16.888
You know?
I mean, it's like,

39:16.922 --> 39:19.991
the guy has to be
the center of attention.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.095
Uh, that's not, uh,
that's not how I saw it.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.097
That-- maybe you saw it
that way, but...

39:27.833 --> 39:31.903
To me, everything fun
and everything exciting

39:31.937 --> 39:35.841
was always happening
without me.

39:38.944 --> 39:41.813
(sighs)

39:41.847 --> 39:43.482
Explain this to me.

39:43.515 --> 39:44.950
You weren't lost?

39:46.084 --> 39:48.554
I'm not as helpless
as people think.

39:52.624 --> 39:54.726
So unbelievable.

39:55.827 --> 39:57.596
So, Don,

39:57.629 --> 39:59.164
how do you feel about working
with Charlie now?

39:59.197 --> 40:01.833
(Don sighs heavily)

40:03.502 --> 40:05.070
I just always feel like I'm
taking advantage of him,

40:05.103 --> 40:07.205
you know,
like I'm using him or something.

40:07.238 --> 40:11.042
* There's nothing here,
but still we try *

40:11.076 --> 40:15.814
* The conversations
come and go *

40:15.847 --> 40:18.484
* Like the day goes down

40:18.517 --> 40:20.085
Charlie?

40:21.186 --> 40:23.889
* And now I read
between the lines *

40:23.922 --> 40:25.857
I love...

40:28.494 --> 40:31.062
I love working with my brother.

40:31.096 --> 40:34.099
* There'll be no peace of mind

40:38.870 --> 40:42.007
You were actually walking home?

40:42.040 --> 40:44.009
Well, yeah,
'cause once I...

40:44.042 --> 40:47.078
once I got to the road,
it was pretty easy.

40:47.112 --> 40:48.079
I mean, he's eight.

40:48.113 --> 40:49.548
I like walking.

40:49.581 --> 40:51.683
You know, that-that's
like, that's my sport.

40:51.717 --> 40:53.619
You've got hockey,
you've got baseball.

40:53.652 --> 40:54.653
I've got walking.

40:54.686 --> 40:57.556
Like, you like
speed walking?

40:57.589 --> 40:59.558
No, normal...
You've never taken a walk?

40:59.591 --> 41:05.196
* In and out of sight
like a prodigal son. *
