00:45.183 --> 00:47.133
Ahh. My first day back

00:47.166 --> 00:48.233
from summer vacation.

00:48.266 --> 00:54.050
I am excited to get on
with the fun of learning.

00:56.116 --> 00:57.350
Hey there, my dudes.

00:57.383 --> 00:59.216
Can I get a high-five?

00:59.250 --> 01:01.350
Hey, high-five!
Ha ha ha!

01:01.383 --> 01:03.050
High-five here!

01:03.083 --> 01:04.150
High-f--

01:04.183 --> 01:06.000
[laughs weakly]

01:06.033 --> 01:07.183
Yeah, that's it.

01:07.216 --> 01:10.150
Bah! Why does
everyone ignore me?

01:10.183 --> 01:11.333
I'll tell
you why.

01:11.366 --> 01:13.050
'Cause you're
a shorty.

01:13.083 --> 01:15.266
Is that any reason
to ignore me?

01:15.300 --> 01:17.433
I ask you.

01:18.116 --> 01:20.366
But why do<i>you</i>

01:20.400 --> 01:23.233
you're not
that much taller than me,

01:23.266 --> 01:26.050
Andy suriano.

01:26.433 --> 01:28.483
What'd you say,
shorty?

01:29.016 --> 01:31.050
Ha ha ha!

01:31.083 --> 01:33.300
I said nothing.

01:35.066 --> 01:37.283
[Bell rings]

01:46.350 --> 01:51.100
Must make it
to my locker!

01:51.300 --> 01:53.066
Girl: Uh! Uh!

01:53.100 --> 01:55.100
Oh, please excuse me.

01:55.133 --> 01:56.150
Boy: Whoa!

01:56.183 --> 01:58.133
Sorry. Whoa! Hey!

01:58.166 --> 02:00.283
Watch out! Whoa!

02:00.316 --> 02:02.083
Uhh!

02:02.116 --> 02:03.466
Well, I'm sorry.

02:04.000 --> 02:05.316
Was I in the way?

02:05.350 --> 02:06.483
All but Dexter: Yes!

02:07.016 --> 02:09.450
Andy:
Smooth move,
shorty.

02:09.483 --> 02:13.366
So, how's
my little man today?

02:13.400 --> 02:15.383
Not so good, mom!

02:15.416 --> 02:18.033
I'm tired of being
a little man.

02:18.066 --> 02:21.400
I want to be big
like everyone else!

02:21.433 --> 02:24.366
But I'm still a shorty.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.483
Ah, honey.

02:26.016 --> 02:26.416
Don't cry.

02:26.450 --> 02:28.383
You're at just
the right age

02:28.416 --> 02:30.466
for your
growth spurt, too.

02:31.000 --> 02:31.483
I am?

02:32.016 --> 02:33.100
Sure!

02:33.133 --> 02:35.250
Mom: You should
be feeling those
growing pains

02:35.283 --> 02:36.266
any time now.

02:36.300 --> 02:39.366
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Thanks for the info!

02:39.400 --> 02:40.400
[Gasps]

02:40.433 --> 02:42.450
Uhh! Ugh!

02:42.483 --> 02:44.150
Whew.

02:44.183 --> 02:45.200
Hey, mom!

02:45.233 --> 02:49.000
I think that the pain's
already beginning.

02:49.450 --> 02:51.216
Hi, Dexter!

02:51.250 --> 02:52.133
Uhh!

02:52.166 --> 02:53.083
Bye, Dexter!

02:53.116 --> 02:55.383
When my
growth spurt happens,

02:55.416 --> 02:57.466
I am going to be a giant!

02:58.000 --> 03:01.483
Ooh. I better get ready
for my new height.

03:06.333 --> 03:07.233
Success!

03:07.266 --> 03:09.283
I have completed my preparations

03:09.316 --> 03:11.116
for my growth spurt.

03:11.150 --> 03:13.316
Just in time, too,

03:13.350 --> 03:17.333
'cause I think I feel
my growing pains coming on!

03:17.366 --> 03:20.200
Uh! Ah ah ah!

03:20.233 --> 03:21.300
Aah!

03:21.333 --> 03:24.100
[Grunting]

03:24.133 --> 03:27.333
Say, that was a good one.

03:30.316 --> 03:31.416
Uh!

03:31.450 --> 03:34.083
Uh--oh.

03:35.033 --> 03:37.033
Ah.

03:37.066 --> 03:38.300
Uh--oh.

03:38.333 --> 03:41.316
That ought to be enough pain.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.133
But what is this?

03:43.166 --> 03:45.383
Have I grown?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.283
No! I am still
a shorty!

03:51.316 --> 03:53.433
Bah! I will grow
a long gray beard

03:53.466 --> 03:55.416
waiting for my growing pains

03:55.450 --> 03:56.400
to happen.

03:56.433 --> 03:58.033
But I think

03:58.066 --> 04:00.233
that with all the sophisticated
high-tech equipment

04:00.266 --> 04:02.300
that I have at my disposal,

04:02.333 --> 04:06.233
I can invent
an elegant scientific solution.

04:06.266 --> 04:09.333
Aah!

04:09.366 --> 04:10.483
Ha ha!

04:11.016 --> 04:13.350
That's the rough stuff now!

04:13.383 --> 04:17.066
Now can I
get a measurement here?

04:17.100 --> 04:19.116
Computer:
Height unchanged.

04:19.150 --> 04:20.433
[Yells]

04:20.466 --> 04:23.466
This should do it, I think.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.266
Height, here I come.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.283
Begin!

04:27.316 --> 04:29.266
[Yelling]

04:31.450 --> 04:34.333
Aah! It's working!

04:34.366 --> 04:38.116
I'm growing taller!

04:41.400 --> 04:44.016
I've done it!

04:44.050 --> 04:46.083
I'm taller!

04:49.450 --> 04:52.316
That's not right.

04:52.350 --> 04:56.116
No, no, no, no!

04:56.150 --> 04:57.150
Computer: Dexter,

04:57.183 --> 05:01.016
that's my semicolon
you're pounding on.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.150
Well, sorry!

05:02.183 --> 05:04.266
But I could not
see the keys.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.483
Here. I'll lower
the screen for you.

05:07.016 --> 05:08.233
I want to show you
something.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.333
The computations to make you,
an individual, taller

05:11.366 --> 05:13.433
are too complex
at this point.

05:13.466 --> 05:15.100
Yes, I know.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.416
But the problem
of shrinking

05:16.450 --> 05:19.050
the rest of the world
around you

05:19.083 --> 05:20.216
is 100% achievable.

05:20.250 --> 05:23.133
Hey, that is genius!

05:23.166 --> 05:25.383
Let's do it!

05:33.433 --> 05:35.383

for the ride, mom.

05:35.416 --> 05:37.216
Sure, kids.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.300
Bye, mom.

05:38.333 --> 05:41.300
So, Dee Dee, notice
anything different today?

05:41.333 --> 05:42.266
Nope.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.200

Sorry, Jennifer.

06:14.100 --> 06:16.216
I can't hear you
up here.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.033
You'll have to speak up

06:18.066 --> 06:19.366
if you want any attention

06:19.400 --> 06:22.333
from the big guy up here!

you're trying

"smooth move,

Yes, Dee Dee,

inventing the wheel.

in space.

things happened

before
you were born.

10:09.483 --> 10:11.183
Details, details.

10:11.216 --> 10:14.350
The point is,
I was really cool,

10:14.383 --> 10:16.350
which reminds me
of the time

10:16.383 --> 10:18.283
when I was young, handsome,

10:18.316 --> 10:19.416
and single,

10:19.450 --> 10:22.433
and, uh, I was
in an alien world!

No--an alien world

as a man of science,

10:28.250 --> 10:30.333
is top secret, of course.

it has something to do

to learn the hard way.

being chased,

Huh?

12:26.400 --> 12:27.450
Hey, dudes.

12:27.483 --> 12:30.050
Ben? Oh, yeah.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.350
That jerk--double agent--

12:31.383 --> 12:32.466
and after the president.

12:33.000 --> 12:35.250
Dee Dee,

You thought
the party was

12:35.283 --> 12:38.000
so awesome, and I
was there, too.

12:38.033 --> 12:38.466
Hi, Dex!

12:39.000 --> 12:42.083
So I introduced you
to darby.

12:42.116 --> 12:43.166
Remember?

12:43.200 --> 12:48.150
Dexter, voice-over:
And there she was--

12:48.183 --> 12:49.150
Sally's comet!

12:49.183 --> 12:51.316
It headed right
for the president!

12:51.350 --> 12:53.416
I leapt into action...

12:53.450 --> 12:57.483
Right into Ben's
pink sports car.

12:58.016 --> 13:01.433
But luckily, it was the cool
kind of pink sports car

13:01.466 --> 13:03.316
that transforms.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.433
Into a unicorn!

13:05.466 --> 13:06.433
[Unicorn neighs]

13:06.466 --> 13:09.266
We had no time to spare.

13:10.483 --> 13:12.033
So we worked
together.

13:12.066 --> 13:15.266
Even though I did
most of the cool stuff.

13:16.150 --> 13:18.300
Time was running out.

13:28.216 --> 13:31.250
But we
weren't worried.

13:33.100 --> 13:35.350
And for serving
the president,

13:35.383 --> 13:38.183
I was made president.

13:38.216 --> 13:40.033
You're off
your rocker.

13:40.066 --> 13:41.033
It's true!

13:41.066 --> 13:43.466
No, really. You're
on the floor, Dex.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.366
Again?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.466
Stupid chair!

13:46.000 --> 13:48.483
Ahem! All right, then,
billion-year-old gal sis,

13:49.016 --> 13:50.150
where was I?

13:50.183 --> 13:53.000
Well, you
were just about

13:53.033 --> 13:54.300
to take a nap.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.450
Nap?!

15:51.350 --> 15:52.333
So?

15:52.366 --> 15:54.216
Now, Dee Dee, we have been

15:54.250 --> 15:56.300
through this scenario
so many times before,

15:56.333 --> 15:59.366
and you know that I am
helpless to assist you

15:59.400 --> 16:02.483
for one simple
and very basic reason--

16:03.016 --> 16:06.150

get my hair back!

Well...

16:23.350 --> 16:25.200
No.

16:26.366 --> 16:28.100
All right, Dexter.

16:28.133 --> 16:29.400

as I say!

17:02.200 --> 17:04.000
Now, Dee Dee,
pay attention.

17:04.033 --> 17:07.466
You are only to apply
one drop of this stuff.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.133
