00:01.841 --> 00:03.142
<i>I love these parties.</i>

00:03.209 --> 00:06.011
I feel like I'm
an ambassador, or a spy,

00:06.078 --> 00:07.779
or, like, a really
high-class prostitute.

00:08.347 --> 00:10.214
Well, Jess,
it's a political fundraiser.

00:10.282 --> 00:11.882
Who's to say
you can't be all three?

00:12.450 --> 00:14.685
Hey, this is...
really good.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.954
I mean, I gotta tell you,
I'm really, um...

00:17.022 --> 00:18.356
- Happy.
- Happy.

00:18.424 --> 00:21.158
It's like the complete
opposite of my marriage.

00:21.225 --> 00:22.792
I'll give you
the opposite of your marriage.

00:22.860 --> 00:24.827
- What?
- Sorry, I just...

00:24.895 --> 00:26.663
I've never heard you talk
about your ex-wife,

00:26.730 --> 00:28.165
and I got really nervous and...

00:28.232 --> 00:30.700
I tried to flirt
information out of you.

00:30.768 --> 00:32.101
- Aw...
- So...

00:32.170 --> 00:34.071
I haven't been home in a week,

00:34.138 --> 00:35.439
and, um...

00:35.506 --> 00:38.840
underneath my dress,
I'm wearing...

00:38.908 --> 00:41.009
a pair of your boxer briefs

00:41.078 --> 00:42.811
that I borrowed

00:42.879 --> 00:44.346
/ stole

00:44.414 --> 00:48.417
/ I'm not giving them back.

00:48.485 --> 00:50.786
Come on. Let's go.
Go to my house right now.

00:50.853 --> 00:52.921
Well, I have to go
to my home for a bit.

00:52.989 --> 00:54.255
No, no, come on.

00:54.323 --> 00:55.890
Come on. Stay with me.

00:55.958 --> 00:58.159
No, I'm worried about the guys.

00:58.227 --> 01:01.563
They must really be missing me
and wondering where I am.

01:01.630 --> 01:03.764
Hey! Sacrifice, sacrifice,

01:03.832 --> 01:05.333
Lava! Touched the lava!
...sacrifice...

01:05.400 --> 01:07.635
Touched the lava! Ow, ow!
Touched the lava, dude!

01:19.814 --> 01:20.948

all right?</i>

01:21.016 --> 01:22.917
You're listening to the radio
and writing with a pen?

01:23.485 --> 01:24.485
What decade are we in?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.152
I cannot listen to that guy.

01:26.220 --> 01:27.921
Come on.
Joe Napoli's the worst, man.

01:27.989 --> 01:30.624
What?
Man, that is blasphemous.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.358
He's the king of
sports radio, man.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.560
I've got an interview
with him today, okay?

01:34.629 --> 01:35.862
He's hiring a new
research assistant.

01:35.930 --> 01:37.463
Hence... the research.

01:37.531 --> 01:40.100
My old basketball coach
set it up.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.800
You know, I'm just
trying to figure out

01:41.868 --> 01:43.435
- how to break it to Elvin.
- You gotta cut ties with that kid.

01:43.503 --> 01:44.569
He freaks me out.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.938
He never blinks.

01:46.006 --> 01:47.673
He's like a tiny little owl
in a shirt.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.042
Hey, guys!

01:50.110 --> 01:52.377
- Hey. Hello.
- I have so much to tell you.

01:52.445 --> 01:54.246
I spent the whole week
with rich people.

01:54.313 --> 01:55.914
I finally tried port.

01:55.982 --> 01:58.950
Were you gone last week?
Is that why it was so quiet?

01:59.018 --> 02:01.552
I feel like I haven't
seen you guys in so long.

02:01.620 --> 02:03.387
You all look so handsome,
so grown-up.

02:03.455 --> 02:04.656
- Thank you.
- Hey, Nick.

02:04.723 --> 02:05.623
I finally notice
the one-eighth Cherokee.

02:05.691 --> 02:07.291
Winston...

02:07.359 --> 02:08.660
that's almost a mustache.

02:08.727 --> 02:11.663
Yeah. It's creepy and thin,
just like I like it.

02:11.730 --> 02:12.863
How was your sexcation
with Russell?

02:12.930 --> 02:14.765
I did have a lot of sex.
Thank you.

02:14.832 --> 02:16.533
What'd you guys do without me?
Hit me up with a headline!

02:16.600 --> 02:18.802
Nothing.
We played True American.

02:18.870 --> 02:21.258
What?! You played True
American without me?

02:21.259 --> 02:22.072
Yes, ma'am.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.474
Oh, sorry. It's Cece.

02:24.542 --> 02:27.010
- Hey, you!
- Tell me everything. How's it going?

02:27.078 --> 02:28.444
- Where are you?
- With Schmidt.

02:28.912 --> 02:29.979
Where are you?

02:30.847 --> 02:31.880
Right here.

02:31.947 --> 02:32.648
Wow.

02:32.716 --> 02:34.283
I am not used to this yet.

02:34.350 --> 02:35.951
I'm surprised
this one's still standing.

02:36.019 --> 02:38.154
We burned through
a lot of ideas last night.

02:38.221 --> 02:40.522
- That's really great.
- We went deep into the stables...

02:40.590 --> 02:42.324
- Yeah. Cool.
- Ugh.

02:42.392 --> 02:43.659
I don't know.
It's like we're living

02:43.727 --> 02:45.226
in a romantic comedy montage.

02:45.294 --> 02:48.897
Like, we, like, throw our heads
back when we laugh,

02:48.964 --> 02:50.631
and I, like, try on
floppy hats for him.

02:50.700 --> 02:52.366
It's pretty perfect.

02:52.434 --> 02:54.402
It's like the first act
of a TV movie

02:54.469 --> 02:57.405
until I find out that he has a
wife and kids in another state.

02:57.972 --> 03:00.341
Yeah, but nothing's
perfect, right?

03:00.409 --> 03:03.811
You're kind of doing
everything on his terms,

03:03.878 --> 03:07.280
living in his beautiful,
fancy house...

03:07.348 --> 03:08.816
I'm not really living there.

03:08.883 --> 03:10.918
Has he ever spent a night here?

03:11.985 --> 03:12.885
Hey, guys.

03:12.953 --> 03:14.088
So, listen, um...

03:14.155 --> 03:15.555
Russell's gonna come
and stay this weekend.

03:15.623 --> 03:17.223
I was just wondering

03:17.290 --> 03:18.557
if you guys could be cool?

03:18.625 --> 03:20.659
Yeah.

03:21.728 --> 03:23.162
- Sure.
- Okay, uh...

03:23.230 --> 03:25.932
Actually, I don't trust what
"cool" means to all of you,

03:26.499 --> 03:28.900
so how about we just say
"be normal"?

03:28.968 --> 03:30.736
- Big R.
- Schmidt.

03:31.303 --> 03:32.070
Your shoe's untied.

03:32.638 --> 03:33.171
Oh.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.741
- What are you doing?
- Label check, man.

03:36.808 --> 03:37.875
- What are you doing?
- Label check.

03:37.943 --> 03:39.943
- What are you doing?
- Just calm down.

03:42.481 --> 03:44.115
Did...

03:51.456 --> 03:53.257
I got it.

03:53.324 --> 03:54.758
- Russell!
- Whoa!

03:54.825 --> 03:56.860
Oh, man, you scared me.

03:56.927 --> 03:57.728
You scared of black people?

03:57.795 --> 03:59.229
No.

03:59.297 --> 04:01.565
- It's 2012, baby.
- I'm...

04:01.633 --> 04:02.350
- Yeah, of course.
- Done deal.

04:02.351 --> 04:03.166
- Easy.
- Of course.

04:03.234 --> 04:04.768
Quick question.

04:04.835 --> 04:06.669
Russell's such a visionary,
would it be okay

04:06.737 --> 04:09.305
if I took him
through my Idea Notebook?

04:09.373 --> 04:10.912
- Nope, not at all.
- Maybe I won't take him

04:10.913 --> 04:12.007
through the whole notebook...

04:12.075 --> 04:13.276
Or how about none of it?

04:13.277 --> 04:14.477
But I have one that I'm
really excited about

04:14.544 --> 04:17.112
called Real Apps, that I know
Russell would be interested in.

04:17.180 --> 04:19.148
- No.
- Nick, Real Apps is my idea.

04:19.214 --> 04:20.983
Real Apps is not your idea.

04:21.050 --> 04:22.717
Yeah, sure, you
might have birthed the idea,

04:22.785 --> 04:24.286
but I midwifed it, and I
midwifed the crap out of it.

04:24.353 --> 04:25.754
- Guys.
- It was a messy birth.

04:25.822 --> 04:26.721
You just thought of the name!

04:26.790 --> 04:28.356
The name is everything.

04:28.424 --> 04:29.892
The name is
the name of the game.

04:29.959 --> 04:32.094
The game is... is the name.
The game <i>is</i> the name.

04:32.162 --> 04:33.962
- The product is the game.
- Guys!

04:35.030 --> 04:38.098
I know you can do this.

04:38.166 --> 04:39.900
You sure you
don't want to swing?

04:39.967 --> 04:41.669
Nah. Pushing's
where the action is.

04:43.204 --> 04:46.039
Elvin, listen, buddy.
I think we should talk.

04:46.107 --> 04:47.741
You know I'm not going to
be here forever, right?

04:47.809 --> 04:50.177
I know about death, Winston.

04:50.244 --> 04:52.713
I know there's no farm
where dogs and grandpas go.

04:52.781 --> 04:55.548
What? No.
It's just that I'm an adult.

04:55.616 --> 04:57.983
It's time for me to get
an adult job with adult people.

04:58.051 --> 05:00.520
You understand, right?

05:00.587 --> 05:02.789
Maybe we should get
to work on your resume

05:02.856 --> 05:04.156
because yours is terrible.

05:04.224 --> 05:06.258
It's 2012, Winston.

05:06.327 --> 05:09.361
Typing is not a special skill.

05:11.497 --> 05:13.933
- And you're familiar with the show?
- Yes, I am. I've been listening for years.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.303
- What do you think of Mr. Napoli?
- He's actually like an idol of mine.

05:17.370 --> 05:18.503
Be honest, jackass!

05:21.174 --> 05:22.695
Would you consider yourself
an undercover cop?

05:22.696 --> 05:23.075
Huh?

05:23.143 --> 05:24.877
Seriously. Are you a cop?
You have to tell me.

05:24.878 --> 05:25.310
No!

05:25.377 --> 05:27.245
How far can you drag
an unconscious man?

05:27.313 --> 05:29.447
I don't know. I never really tried to...
Hello, Mr. Napoli.

05:29.514 --> 05:31.849
If you're as bad an assistant
as you were a point guard,

05:31.916 --> 05:32.817
I'll eat you.

05:32.885 --> 05:34.986
You know, I know you,
Winston Bishop, okay?

05:35.054 --> 05:37.155
Sub-par collegiate career,
went to Latvia,

05:37.223 --> 05:40.725
9% from the European/Women's
3-point line?

05:40.792 --> 05:42.726
- Okay, just...
- Now you wind up in my lap.

05:42.793 --> 05:44.127
Well, I'm the luckiest girl
in school.

05:44.195 --> 05:47.030
Hey, come on in, big guy. I want you to
meet our new assistant, Winston Bishop.

05:47.098 --> 05:49.833
Hey, first of all,
I've not agreed to do it...

05:50.401 --> 05:51.768
Welcome to the team, Winston.

05:51.836 --> 05:53.270
Hope Joe hasn't been
too tough on you.

05:55.706 --> 05:56.973
I'm in. I'll do it.

05:57.607 --> 05:58.574
Um...

05:59.341 --> 06:00.308
So nice to meet you,

06:00.377 --> 06:02.211
Mr. Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.545
Can I sit on your shoulders?

06:03.613 --> 06:04.914
- Sure!
- Really?

06:04.982 --> 06:07.049
- No.
- Oh.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.551
You've made
a wonderful decision.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.220
I'm sure you're going
to learn a lot.

06:11.288 --> 06:12.888
Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.390
Yeah, well, welcome aboard.
You can start today.

06:15.457 --> 06:17.525
I want to Kareem about
a segment on his show.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.660
I want to talk to you
about the jackets.

06:21.693 --> 06:25.060
_

06:19.728 --> 06:21.162
You said we were going
to get show jackets!

06:28.170 --> 06:29.803
Russell, hey.

06:29.871 --> 06:32.072
I could show you around.
I could show you our world.

06:32.140 --> 06:34.375
Way up here, it's crystal-clear.

06:34.442 --> 06:36.410
- Nick, you're doing <i>Aladdin.</i>
- Again?

06:36.977 --> 06:39.280
- Do you like cheeses, Russell?
- What? That's...

06:39.347 --> 06:41.248
- Nick, come on.
- It's for Russell.

06:43.783 --> 06:45.618
So you really just call
these "ethnic noodles"?

06:45.685 --> 06:47.052
No, actually, I don't know.

06:47.120 --> 06:48.754
The only English writing
on the box is,

06:49.522 --> 06:53.424
"Find water. Grow hot.
Family celebrate plus."

06:53.491 --> 06:54.825
That guy.

06:54.892 --> 06:56.126
Nick, stop staring.

06:56.194 --> 06:58.061
I'm not... what?

06:58.129 --> 06:59.730
Schmidt's being
really weird, too.

07:01.800 --> 07:05.402
So I told you and Jess to go
get some sushi at Asakune,

07:05.470 --> 07:07.471
but I hear you
hara-kiri'd that one.

07:07.539 --> 07:10.073
- Well, I know the chef at Namuda.
- Oh, oh. Namuda?

07:11.141 --> 07:13.242
Maybe "My First Sushi."

07:13.810 --> 07:16.245
Baby wants a tempura
California roll.

07:16.313 --> 07:17.647
Little Russell wants...

07:17.715 --> 07:20.483
Little Wussell wants
an avocwado roll!

07:20.551 --> 07:23.386
Schmidt...!
Nick, don't eat his noodles.

07:23.454 --> 07:25.687
- Yeah, but we're bowl brothers, now.
- No, you're not.

07:25.755 --> 07:28.057
- Tighten up, guys.
- I'm gonna kill him.

07:28.124 --> 07:31.727
I'm gonna punch him in his
rich, old white dude face.

07:32.294 --> 07:33.295
Not you.

07:33.863 --> 07:35.163
Joe Napoli.

07:35.231 --> 07:37.032
So I guess you
didn't get the job?

07:37.100 --> 07:39.601
No, I <i>got</i> the job.
And that's the problem.

07:39.669 --> 07:43.437
I want six shakes in my fridge
at all times, ready to go.

07:43.505 --> 07:45.106
And I want it Beyoncé-colored.

07:45.174 --> 07:46.941
Not darker, not lighter.

07:47.709 --> 07:49.277
Beyoncé!

07:51.046 --> 07:53.281
Clean your damn desk!

07:53.349 --> 07:54.615
Don't let him see you cry.

07:56.784 --> 07:58.218
See, I want to kill him.

07:58.286 --> 08:00.287
Russ, I was wondering
if later, if you had a minute,

08:00.355 --> 08:02.155
if you wouldn't mind taking
a look at my Idea Notebook.

08:02.723 --> 08:05.225
- Um... Hold that thought.
- I will hold it.

08:05.293 --> 08:07.127
Hold that thought 'cause he
doesn't want to hear it, Nick.

08:07.195 --> 08:08.595
Those ideas were 51% mine.

08:11.164 --> 08:13.232
I got it, I got it!
Russell, move, my man.

08:13.300 --> 08:14.666
What'd I do?

08:14.734 --> 08:16.302
No, you did nothing, my man.
Don't blame yourself.

08:19.539 --> 08:21.107
Yah! It just fights back
a little bit, Russ.

08:23.642 --> 08:24.710
Anchor me! Anchor me!

08:24.778 --> 08:26.645
It's choking me!
Come on. Go, go, go!

08:26.713 --> 08:29.480
Come on!

08:29.548 --> 08:32.250
- Anchor me. Don't grope me.
- Jess, get in there!

08:32.318 --> 08:33.784
Jess!

08:33.852 --> 08:34.852
One more big one!

08:36.222 --> 08:39.390
Oh, my God. Sorry.

08:40.058 --> 08:41.092
You guys,

08:41.159 --> 08:43.094
my contractor knows a really great plumber.
- Please.

08:43.162 --> 08:45.930
- I know the best plumbers in the business.
- White guy knows a plumber.

08:45.997 --> 08:48.265
Sorry. Plumbing's, like, a really
sensitive topic around here.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.366
I-I didn't know.

08:49.434 --> 08:51.268
I mean, who would?

08:52.336 --> 08:53.337
Um...

08:53.905 --> 08:55.406
hey...

08:55.473 --> 08:57.541
who wants to play
True American?

08:57.608 --> 08:59.476
- I'm in.
- That sounds like a great idea.

09:00.044 --> 09:00.776
So it's 50%

09:00.844 --> 09:03.479
drinking game,
50% life-size Candyland.

09:03.547 --> 09:04.713
Well, it's more
like 75 drinking,

09:04.781 --> 09:06.682
20 Candyland, and by the way,

09:06.750 --> 09:09.118
- the floor is molten lava.
- It's actually 90% drinking,

09:09.186 --> 09:11.787
and it's got a loose
Candyland-like structure to it.

09:11.855 --> 09:13.656
- Well, with steaks.
- Hey, guys, we doing teams?

09:13.723 --> 09:15.558
- Yeah.
- Ready?

09:15.625 --> 09:17.693
One, two, three, go.

09:17.761 --> 09:20.763
- Two, two, four.
- Wow, I'm with Russell. Perfect.

09:20.831 --> 09:23.398
- What? You don't want to be on my team?
- Well, I just copied you.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.815
You haven't given me
any information yet.

09:24.816 --> 09:25.200
Oh, okay.

09:25.268 --> 09:26.368
So it starts off there are

09:26.436 --> 09:27.736
four zones.
An alternate zone

09:27.804 --> 09:29.071
is a crazy zone.

09:29.138 --> 09:30.305
And there's a trail of chairs.

09:30.373 --> 09:31.774
But the floor is lava.

09:31.842 --> 09:33.074
These are the pawns.
They're the soldiers

09:33.141 --> 09:34.041
of the secret order.

09:34.109 --> 09:35.710
This is the king of the castle.

09:35.778 --> 09:37.678
And remember, everything
you hear in True American

09:37.745 --> 09:39.380
is a lie, knock on wood.

09:39.448 --> 09:40.782
And it starts
with a shotgun tip-off,

09:40.850 --> 09:43.250
- okay?
- Oh, <i>that</i> I can do.

09:43.318 --> 09:45.119
Shotgun, for sure.

09:45.187 --> 09:46.588
Oh, yeah!

09:46.655 --> 09:47.622
All right! Yeah!

09:47.690 --> 09:49.389
Yeah! Yes!

09:49.457 --> 09:51.592
Yeah, there's no going back now.

09:51.659 --> 09:53.393
One, two, three, four, JFK!

09:53.461 --> 09:55.195
FDR! Up, up, up!
FDR!

09:59.166 --> 10:00.767
Russell, you're
in the lava, man.

10:00.835 --> 10:02.736
I don't understand.
Abe Lincoln, George Washington.

10:02.804 --> 10:04.037
Cherry tree!

10:05.772 --> 10:07.106
All right, Americans,

10:07.173 --> 10:08.541
you ready?
Let's do the count.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.776
One, two, three.

10:14.414 --> 10:15.447
That's me!

10:16.984 --> 10:19.785
Okay, remember:
The ground is lava.

10:19.853 --> 10:22.687
Russell! Russell!

10:22.755 --> 10:26.090
Don't touch the lava.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.291
Big R!

10:27.359 --> 10:29.794
Only thing we have to fear

10:29.862 --> 10:30.962
Is fear itself!

10:31.030 --> 10:32.998
- Drink!
- Drink!

10:39.103 --> 10:41.038
Jimmy Carter... atop...

10:41.605 --> 10:43.541
Grover Cleveland.

10:43.608 --> 10:44.742
What now?

10:44.809 --> 10:45.976
- More beer.
- More beer.

10:47.478 --> 10:49.312
I got to get to the castle!

10:49.380 --> 10:50.848
- Go, Nick, go!
- Russell, you're kind of

10:50.916 --> 10:51.949
ripped up, huh?

10:52.017 --> 10:53.683
Well, I used to work summers

10:53.751 --> 10:56.586
in a lumber camp near Banff,
and I still split my own wood.

10:56.654 --> 10:57.820
JFK!
FDR!

11:01.859 --> 11:03.026
You're pretty good
at this, old-timer.

11:03.093 --> 11:04.727
Ooh, ooh, Cece,

11:04.795 --> 11:06.395
this is the best game
of True American ever.

11:06.463 --> 11:07.564
I'm this close to winning.

11:07.631 --> 11:09.565
I'm gonna go get in your bed.

11:09.632 --> 11:10.498
Damn.

11:10.567 --> 11:11.934
Yeah, I'm out.

11:12.001 --> 11:12.901
Schmidt, no!

11:12.969 --> 11:16.471
- No!
- Does it mean we win?

11:16.539 --> 11:17.906
- Yes, we win!
- Whoo!

11:21.911 --> 11:24.179
USA! USA!

11:24.246 --> 11:25.580
Oh, a little bit. Ah!

11:25.647 --> 11:27.682
USA! USA!

11:29.451 --> 11:30.885
I'm trashed.

11:30.953 --> 11:32.620
I'm in a trash bag right now.

11:32.688 --> 11:34.589
- It's true.
- I think we should

11:34.656 --> 11:35.690
call it a night.

11:35.757 --> 11:36.824
No, no, hang on.

11:36.892 --> 11:38.826
I was, I was saying something.

11:38.894 --> 11:40.494
What you was saying to me.
I remember.

11:40.562 --> 11:42.361
Hey, guys, guys?
I'm really sorry.

11:42.429 --> 11:43.529
I'm on a water break.

11:43.598 --> 11:44.698
It's over here.

11:44.765 --> 11:46.165
Oh, man, you were

11:46.233 --> 11:47.867
giving me advice on my boss
because

11:47.935 --> 11:51.738
you are also a rich white man.
And that's okay.

11:51.806 --> 11:52.739
Hell, yeah, I am!

11:54.174 --> 11:57.175
Hey, I love ya.
. Russell, we have a big day

11:57.176 --> 11:58.510
planned tomorrow,
so maybe we should...

11:58.578 --> 12:00.178
Shh-shh, hang on a sec.

12:00.246 --> 12:01.513
Let me straighten you out.

12:01.581 --> 12:02.680
Here's what you do.

12:02.848 --> 12:04.483
Your boss is power-playing you.

12:05.550 --> 12:07.752
So you need
to power-play him back.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.354
- Yes.
- How do I do that?

12:10.922 --> 12:12.690
Dip your boys in his shake.

12:12.758 --> 12:13.557
What?!

12:13.558 --> 12:14.592
That's all you gotta do.

12:14.660 --> 12:15.693
Your testicles, dip 'em in,

12:15.761 --> 12:16.995
wring em out, dip it again

12:17.062 --> 12:18.429
and give him his shake.
That's how you do it.

12:18.497 --> 12:19.463
That's a terrible idea.

12:19.531 --> 12:21.065
Jess, no, no. Shh.

12:21.133 --> 12:22.366
Hang on. It's like a guy thing.

12:22.434 --> 12:24.002
Territory. Jess, you don't know.

12:24.069 --> 12:25.202
It's a guy thing, you know?

12:25.270 --> 12:26.771
Jess doesn't get it.
It's a territory...

12:26.839 --> 12:28.539
- Stop copying Russell.
- I'm not copying him. I love him.

12:28.607 --> 12:30.206
Classic is a classic,
you know what I mean?

12:30.274 --> 12:32.342
Just get in there,
dunk your nuggets in his shake!

12:32.409 --> 12:33.610
That's what I'm talking about.

12:33.678 --> 12:35.112
Well, we all learned a lot.

12:35.179 --> 12:37.080
You know what would make
this night really great?

12:37.448 --> 12:38.649
- Idea Notebook.
- Sleep.

12:39.216 --> 12:40.050
Yeah?

12:40.118 --> 12:43.586
Have you ever wanted to take
a ride on a magic idea?

12:43.655 --> 12:44.787
Well, strap on, Russell.

12:44.855 --> 12:46.321
Russell, let's go to sleep.

12:46.389 --> 12:47.823
I'll be in in a second.

12:47.891 --> 12:50.159
I want to hear your idea.

12:50.226 --> 12:51.560
Take one more of these,

12:51.628 --> 12:53.328
and then this idea's
gonna be even better.

12:53.396 --> 12:54.764
- Okay.
- Down the hatch!

12:58.034 --> 12:59.501
Let's have a little
bit more of that.

13:01.840 --> 13:04.876
I'm mad at him, and I've never
been mad at him before.

13:04.943 --> 13:07.144
Oh, Jess!

13:07.212 --> 13:09.546
This room is not a place
of comforting, okay?

13:09.614 --> 13:11.015
This is Darwin's jungle,

13:11.083 --> 13:12.616
where open-minded people do

13:12.684 --> 13:14.352
weird things to each other.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.652
Go away.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.821
Yeah.

13:18.890 --> 13:20.423
I can't fight with him.

13:20.491 --> 13:22.125
That's our thing.
We don't fight.

13:22.193 --> 13:24.427
He used to fight all the time
with his ex-wife.

13:24.495 --> 13:25.962
I think he likes
that we're peaceful.

13:26.030 --> 13:28.298
Fighting's good. It's healthy.

13:28.366 --> 13:30.133
It's how you know it's working.

13:30.201 --> 13:33.402
You know, Jess, what Cece
and I like to do

13:33.469 --> 13:35.637
is we like to fight
with our bodies.

13:35.705 --> 13:37.839
It's like very intense game
of Capture the Flag.

13:37.908 --> 13:39.574
I won't make you guess
what the flag is.

13:40.877 --> 13:42.111
As my financial business
partner,

13:42.178 --> 13:43.913
I appreciate you
taking the time.

13:43.980 --> 13:45.847
All right, Russell said
we need a prototype.

13:45.916 --> 13:49.517
So, Mr. Schmidt, I now present
you "Real Apps."

13:49.584 --> 13:51.685
The phone obviously goes back
here where the phone goes,

13:51.753 --> 13:53.521
and then these are all the apps.

13:53.588 --> 13:55.089
You've got a Zippo.
You've got a fork.

13:55.157 --> 13:56.124
You've got a spoon.

13:56.191 --> 13:57.525
That's a corn holder.

13:58.092 --> 13:59.727
It's also a gentleman's shiv.

13:59.795 --> 14:01.930
Nick, it's a prototype
of a prototype at best.

14:02.195 --> 14:03.230
- Let me see it.
- No.

14:03.231 --> 14:04.831
- Don't be mean about it.
- Come on, let me see it.

14:04.899 --> 14:06.181
- You got a bottle opener.
- Come on.

14:06.182 --> 14:07.534
- Yeah.
- Look at this.

14:07.601 --> 14:09.536
There's no brushed steel,
no nickel.

14:09.603 --> 14:11.371
I mean, it's got none
of the baller metals.

14:11.439 --> 14:13.106
I mean, come on, man.

14:13.174 --> 14:15.508
I'm not gonna get Winkelvossed
because of your sloppiness.

14:15.576 --> 14:17.911
What do you mean, "I"?
Real Apps is my idea.

14:17.979 --> 14:19.512
You just came up with the name!

14:19.580 --> 14:21.647
Yeah, and the name
is the game, friendo.

14:21.714 --> 14:22.949
- Mm-mm.
- Yes, it is, man.

14:23.016 --> 14:24.716
No, it isn't.
No, it isn't, man.

14:24.784 --> 14:26.352
Would you line up
around the corner

14:26.420 --> 14:28.254
if they called the iPhone
a "slippery germ brick"?

14:28.322 --> 14:29.488
Yeah, actually, I might.

14:29.556 --> 14:31.023
That's why they call it
basketball

14:31.091 --> 14:32.124
and not "peach basket
catch-it-up."

14:32.692 --> 14:34.260
You just came up with that?

14:34.328 --> 14:36.894
<i>Hey, hey, we're back here on
the</i> Joe Napoli Show, <i>and let me</i>

14:36.963 --> 14:39.197
introduce you to a new member
of the <i>Joe Napoli Show</i> family,

14:39.265 --> 14:41.499
and that is Winston Bishop,
who is our new assistant.

14:41.567 --> 14:43.134
I'll tell you what--
he's sharp as a tack.

14:43.202 --> 14:44.502
Ladies, there's no ring
on his finger,

14:44.570 --> 14:45.670
and, Winston,
why don't you tell us

14:45.737 --> 14:46.771
just a little bit
about yourself?

14:46.839 --> 14:47.905
Hey, thanks, a lot, Joe.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.474
I really want
to tell you about myself.

14:49.541 --> 14:51.009
You know, I been
on the job two days,

14:51.077 --> 14:52.843
and I don't know how
to make no milk shake.

14:52.910 --> 14:54.618
Oh, and I played two years of
mediocre Division I basketball.

14:54.619 --> 14:55.045
Wow.

14:55.113 --> 14:56.280
And why was that?

14:56.348 --> 14:57.815
Well, because I really didn't
know how to play basketball.

14:57.883 --> 14:59.816
I got recruited
for a girls' volleyball team.

14:59.884 --> 15:02.119
All right, there he is.
That's Winston Bishop.

15:02.187 --> 15:04.021
And we'll see you again
probably never.

15:04.089 --> 15:05.289
All right, turning now
to the NBA picture,

15:05.357 --> 15:06.656
it looks like the West...

15:08.258 --> 15:09.525
These are hangover eggs.

15:09.593 --> 15:11.194
See, they'll either stop you

15:11.261 --> 15:12.695
from throwing up
the rest of the day

15:12.762 --> 15:14.197
or you'll just throw it
up really fast.

15:14.264 --> 15:15.431
It's high-risk, high-reward.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.233
Oh, maybe I should just go
back to bed.

15:17.301 --> 15:19.135
I have a really nice
day planned for us.

15:19.203 --> 15:20.636
We're gonna go apple picking...

15:20.704 --> 15:23.806
I don't... I don't pick apples.

15:23.874 --> 15:25.807
That... that's...
that's not gonna happen.

15:25.875 --> 15:27.409
Are you serious?

15:27.477 --> 15:31.113
Because it's picking
and it's apple...

15:31.180 --> 15:31.980
You're serious?

15:32.048 --> 15:33.482
That literally sounds like hell.

15:33.549 --> 15:35.384
Okay.

15:35.451 --> 15:36.251
Are we in a fight?

15:36.319 --> 15:37.152
We're not fighting.

15:37.220 --> 15:38.453
This feels like a fight, Jess.

15:38.521 --> 15:39.888
This is not a fight!

15:42.457 --> 15:44.158
Russell, my man,
it seems these days

15:44.226 --> 15:46.460
there's an app for everything.

15:46.528 --> 15:47.528
Doesn't it, though?

15:47.595 --> 15:49.430
Yeah, but there isn't.

15:49.498 --> 15:51.499
Let's say I'm out
and about, you know,

15:51.566 --> 15:54.768
being mobile, and I
want to cut a bagel,

15:54.836 --> 15:55.836
cobble a shoe.

15:55.904 --> 15:57.270
Haberdash on the fly.

15:57.338 --> 15:58.638
Is there an app for that?

15:58.705 --> 15:59.272
No.
Is there?

15:59.340 --> 16:00.940
Until now.

16:01.208 --> 16:03.510
- Right.
- We now present to you...

16:04.577 --> 16:05.845
Real Apps!
Real Apps!

16:05.913 --> 16:06.612
The prototype.

16:06.680 --> 16:09.149
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

16:09.216 --> 16:10.150
Relapse?

16:10.217 --> 16:11.518
Real Apps.

16:11.585 --> 16:12.851
Real Apps.

16:12.919 --> 16:13.752
Relapse?

16:16.955 --> 16:18.156
Relapse?!

16:18.424 --> 16:19.091
Would you calm...?

16:19.159 --> 16:20.992
You called my baby "relapse"?!

16:20.993 --> 16:22.794
No, I didn't call
it anything. Just calm down!

16:22.862 --> 16:23.962
- I gave you 51% of this for Relapse?
- Russell. Russell. Enough.

16:24.462 --> 16:25.462
Russell...

16:25.930 --> 16:27.198
Hold it in your hands, my man.

16:27.199 --> 16:29.233
- We're in the middle of something, guys.
- No, no, no.

16:29.301 --> 16:29.985
We're great. We're fine.
Show it to him, Schmidt.

16:29.986 --> 16:30.668
It's all right here.

16:30.735 --> 16:32.736
- Let me show it to you.
- Yeah, but you have to...

16:32.804 --> 16:33.804
- I want to... Russell.
- You're going the wrong way.

16:33.872 --> 16:36.574
Aah! Oh! Oh, oh, no!

16:36.641 --> 16:38.008
- Oh, my God, Russell, are you okay?
- No, no, no.

16:38.077 --> 16:39.210
I've been stabbed!

16:39.278 --> 16:40.578
It wasn't ready.

16:40.645 --> 16:42.113
- It wasn't ready.
- You called it Relapse, idiot!

16:42.181 --> 16:43.181
Where are the Band-Aids?

16:43.248 --> 16:44.147
- No Band-Aids!
- What?!

16:44.215 --> 16:46.015
Ow!

16:46.084 --> 16:47.584
I'll get you a takeout napkin
with some Scotch tape.

16:47.651 --> 16:48.552
Searing pain!

16:48.619 --> 16:49.786
So sorry.

16:49.853 --> 16:52.089
Here. Oh, sorry.
Ow! Ow! Jess.

16:52.156 --> 16:53.557
Jess, do you know what? You just
taped a napkin to my hand.

16:53.624 --> 16:54.558
You know what?
I'm gonna go.

16:54.625 --> 16:55.792
I need to be home right now.

16:55.859 --> 16:56.859
Is that a problem?

16:56.927 --> 16:58.528
No.

16:58.596 --> 17:00.029
I'm fine.

17:00.097 --> 17:01.597
It's great.

17:02.164 --> 17:03.799
We're great.

17:04.866 --> 17:05.767
Yeah.

17:08.204 --> 17:09.938
- I'm s...
- Just nicked him.

17:14.410 --> 17:15.711
Get it all out.

17:15.778 --> 17:17.044
I have an idea
for your Idea book!

17:17.113 --> 17:18.413
Replace the Band-Aids!

17:18.981 --> 17:19.946
Very fair.

17:20.515 --> 17:21.182
It's so sticky!

17:21.250 --> 17:22.150
Oh, I have an app for that.

17:24.114 --> 17:25.480
What are you doing here?

17:25.548 --> 17:27.382
Why aren't you at your new job?

17:28.450 --> 17:29.583
I'm quitting.

17:29.651 --> 17:31.418
You're quitting your dream job?

17:31.486 --> 17:32.819
Well, I mean,
there's good news.

17:32.887 --> 17:34.288
I want to keep
being your nanny.

17:34.356 --> 17:35.589
That's what I've come
to tell your mom.

17:36.157 --> 17:38.292
I can't let you do that.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.060
Mom? Mom?

17:40.128 --> 17:42.094
Winston just asked me
if he can smoke weed.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.563
- What?!
- What?!

17:43.631 --> 17:45.365
- No, see...
- He said when we go to the park,

17:45.432 --> 17:46.432
he wanted to do it.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.433
And I get to hold it

17:47.501 --> 17:48.301
because

17:48.369 --> 17:50.270
I'm a minor.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.305
Where is your imagination
taking you? No!

17:52.373 --> 17:53.806
- You said that in front of my kid?!
- Gina...

17:53.874 --> 17:55.074
Are you serious?!

17:55.141 --> 17:56.842
Are you completely insane?!

17:56.910 --> 17:58.310
Gina, you know me, okay?

17:58.378 --> 17:59.145
I'm wearing a tie
and everything.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.545
You're never, ever
gonna nanny again.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.215
I will destroy you
on the nanny boards.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.984
You can count on that.
Come on, Elvin. Just...

18:05.051 --> 18:07.786
Let me explain. Let me...
Elvin, Elvin, Elvin, hey, now.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.053
Elvin, let's get away.
Get away from the hippie.

18:09.121 --> 18:10.323
Come on.

18:13.292 --> 18:14.858
Bye, Winston.

18:17.895 --> 18:18.763
Bye, Elvin.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.431
No, no, don't talk to him.

18:20.499 --> 18:23.200
It's 4:20. Don't you
have to be somewhere?

18:24.603 --> 18:26.337
Oh, no.

18:26.905 --> 18:27.905
The shakes.

18:28.172 --> 18:31.205
Six... Where are you,
number six?

18:31.207 --> 18:33.008
Hey, Bishop, I
thought you left early.

18:33.075 --> 18:34.875
Assumed you weren't
coming back.

18:35.443 --> 18:36.444
There was something wrong
with the shakes,

18:37.012 --> 18:38.013
so I went in and just

18:38.014 --> 18:40.349
threw them out because there's
something wrong with 'em.

18:40.350 --> 18:41.984
Speaking of which, I should
probably go ahead and throw

18:41.985 --> 18:43.453
that one out.
What did you do to the shakes?

18:45.021 --> 18:46.322
They've been compromised.

18:46.389 --> 18:49.025
What... did... you... do?

18:49.092 --> 18:51.560
Look, I really, really want
this job, Mr. Napoli, and

18:52.128 --> 18:54.496
I know you're going to fire me
if I tell you what I did,

18:54.564 --> 18:56.231
but I would love a future here,

18:56.299 --> 18:58.166
and I don't want that
to be jeopardized

18:58.234 --> 19:00.902
by a moment of...
poor judgment.

19:03.972 --> 19:06.607
I put my <i>beans</i> in your shakes.

19:07.175 --> 19:08.376
Yeah, and I...

19:08.844 --> 19:10.945
I shook it around
a little bit like this.

19:11.512 --> 19:14.915
In there? You stuck 'em down
in there, huh?

19:14.983 --> 19:16.317
I did.

19:22.056 --> 19:23.389
Oh, man!

19:27.127 --> 19:28.461
You know what we're gonna do?

19:28.528 --> 19:30.129
We're gonna do that to Kareem.

19:42.241 --> 19:43.075
Hi.

19:43.242 --> 19:44.943
Hi.

19:45.011 --> 19:46.579
I have something to say to you.

19:46.646 --> 19:48.647
- You don't have to apologize.
- Well, I'm not here to apologize.

19:48.648 --> 19:50.749
I'm here to fight with
you, and I don't care

19:50.750 --> 19:52.584
- if you want to fight or not.
- All right, let's fight.

19:52.585 --> 19:54.853
Well, I was prepared to have a
perfectly nice weekend with you,

19:54.920 --> 19:56.888
and you just give up,
and you come home.

19:56.955 --> 19:59.590
Because I was bleeding from
my hand. I had to go to the ER.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.892
- I had to get a stitch.
- Ooh, stitches.

20:01.959 --> 20:04.094
I'm too fancy for a Band-Aid.

20:04.161 --> 20:07.798
I'm actually... I'm actually
really sorry about that.

20:07.866 --> 20:09.600
Jess, I haven't played
a drinking game in ten years.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.402
The only reason I did is
'cause you asked me to.

20:11.469 --> 20:13.303
If I want to have a drink,

20:13.371 --> 20:15.171
I don't really have to play
a game while I'm doing it.

20:15.239 --> 20:17.040
Well, that's my world.
Garbage disposals don't work.

20:17.108 --> 20:19.175
Elevators don't pass inspection.

20:19.243 --> 20:21.344
- Wait. I didn't know about the elevator.
- Yeah, it was, like,

20:21.412 --> 20:24.214
the cables were really thin.
We signed a waiver.

20:24.282 --> 20:26.016
- They took 100 bucks off our rent.
- That's really not safe!

20:26.083 --> 20:28.451
Well, that's where I live,
and those are my friends.

20:28.519 --> 20:31.185
And that wasn't even the
first stabbing this month.

20:31.753 --> 20:34.756
And Russell, my life is just
as important as your life.

20:35.324 --> 20:36.392
And if you want to get with me,

20:36.459 --> 20:37.960
you're gonna have to
get with my friends,

20:38.028 --> 20:39.428
and that is a Spice Girls song.

20:46.467 --> 20:47.501
We just had a fight.

20:48.569 --> 20:50.571
- I won.
- You did not win.

20:50.639 --> 20:52.040
Hey, tell you what.
Let's just go back

20:52.107 --> 20:53.408
to your loft and try again.

20:53.975 --> 20:54.809
Let's just hang out.

20:54.876 --> 20:56.144
Oh. Now?

20:56.711 --> 20:59.580
I mean... I just got here.

20:59.848 --> 21:00.714
Maybe later.

21:02.617 --> 21:05.118
Okay, that sounds like a plan.

21:05.686 --> 21:07.787
Those boxers you borrowed--
I'm gonna need them back.

21:07.855 --> 21:09.990
- They're my lucky underpants.
- Lucky underpants?

21:10.558 --> 21:13.193
And what are the values
of the Olympic games?

21:13.961 --> 21:16.330
Openness, exchange.

21:17.097 --> 21:20.266
The first victims of an
authoritarian security regime.

21:20.834 --> 21:24.869
I'm Kareem Abdul Jabbar, and
that's <i>The View from Up Here.</i>
