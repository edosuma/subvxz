WEBVTT

00:07.920 --> 00:10.127
- You saw it, right?
- Yeah.

00:10.220 --> 00:12.211
I liked it, I really did.

00:12.300 --> 00:16.543
I don't usually care for musicals,
but I thought it was really well done.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.386
Get in the car. Quick.

00:19.060 --> 00:22.132
Wait up! I'll walk with you!

00:28.020 --> 00:30.102
- What the fuck is this?
- Shut your mouth.

00:30.190 --> 00:32.602
- We're good?
- Drive.

00:54.010 --> 00:55.170
Sit there.

00:59.720 --> 01:04.180
Don't embarrass yourself, Marty.
Sit the fuck down. Act like a man.

01:07.810 --> 01:09.858
Sit.

01:31.340 --> 01:32.329
Who shot at us?

01:34.920 --> 01:36.547
I don't know.

01:36.680 --> 01:40.138
Come on, tell me. I'll make
this easy on you. It won't hurt.

01:40.510 --> 01:44.344
Just one behind the ear,
then darkness.

01:45.770 --> 01:48.227
- I got kids.
- Yeah, so do I.

01:48.310 --> 01:50.517
Should've thought about them
before you made your play.

01:50.610 --> 01:54.319
I swear to you, I don't know.

01:55.360 --> 01:59.319
Okay. Finish your cigarette.

02:07.330 --> 02:10.242
Pop the cherry, Vince.

02:13.250 --> 02:15.468
I got this.

02:15.590 --> 02:16.750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.125
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!
- I got it.

02:18.760 --> 02:21.467
Wait. Wait! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:21.550 --> 02:25.919
You guys think
I make those kind of calls?

02:26.020 --> 02:27.806
You think I order hits?

02:27.890 --> 02:29.767
Huh? No, please, don't do this.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.267
Don't do that, please!
I'm a manager.

02:33.730 --> 02:35.641
I stuff money in envelopes,

02:35.740 --> 02:37.560
and I give it to guys,
who kicked it upstairs.

02:37.650 --> 02:39.311
That's all I do.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.982
Now I swear. I give cash to bagmen.

02:44.080 --> 02:46.401
Please. For Christ's sake,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.536
I don't know nothing about no hit.
I don't.

02:48.620 --> 02:53.080
I don't. I swear to you.
I swear on my mother's grave.

02:53.170 --> 02:55.877
Please. Please.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.925
Give it to me, Vince, I'll do it.

03:04.760 --> 03:08.014
- No.
- No?

03:08.100 --> 03:11.684
What's it gonna do?
He don't know nothing.

03:13.980 --> 03:16.938
Already scared the shit out of him.
That's enough.

03:17.650 --> 03:22.019
Good thing for you, Marty,
I brought Vincent along today.

03:22.120 --> 03:24.941
He just saved your life.

03:30.500 --> 03:33.071
Thank you.

03:34.790 --> 03:36.542
Fuck you.

05:12.100 --> 05:14.887
No place to run to. No place to hide.

05:14.980 --> 05:17.722
If the backers knew we were
still fucking around with this...

05:17.810 --> 05:20.358
- We're supposed to be picture-locked.
- Okay, so, unlock it.

05:20.440 --> 05:21.850
Girl, she can’t/rem you, now.

05:21.940 --> 05:24.693
Okay, pause here.
When he says that line,

05:24.780 --> 05:29.069
I want to be on Lori,
not on Larry Brown.

05:29.160 --> 05:30.866
Yeah, but what he's saying
is important,

05:30.950 --> 05:32.497
and Larry's so fucking good
in this thing,

05:32.580 --> 05:33.740
it's like you just want to watch him.

05:33.830 --> 05:36.287
I know, he's great,
but the scene's not about the Wolf.

05:36.370 --> 05:39.749
What's important is how
that line lands on Little Red,

05:39.840 --> 05:45.369
and I want to be on her,
I want to see how her reaction builds.

05:47.470 --> 05:48.755
All right.

05:48.850 --> 05:53.059
Okay. Also, this is tiny,
but you stay in the master too long.

05:53.140 --> 05:55.131
I just need it
to establish the location,

05:55.230 --> 05:57.300
and I want to jump right
into the medium close-ups

05:57.400 --> 05:59.106
as soon as they say their first lines.

05:59.770 --> 06:02.182
You want the close-ups dirty,
or you want them clean?

06:02.280 --> 06:03.599
I want them dirty.

06:03.690 --> 06:05.317
I want it dirty when we're on Lori

06:05.400 --> 06:08.813
because I want to feel
the Wolf's presence, rIght?

06:08.910 --> 06:12.482
- Because that's what she's feeling.
- Okay.

06:13.330 --> 06:15.616
Okay, so, let me play around
with this for a little bit,

06:15.710 --> 06:19.498
- and we'll see what we can do.
- Okay.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.882
So, why don't you go
for a walk, or something?

06:32.970 --> 06:35.097
- Why, how long is it gonna take?
- I don't know.

06:35.180 --> 06:36.306
I know that if you're here,

06:36.390 --> 06:38.017
you're just gonna
keep giving me notes.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.107
Yeah, you're right.

06:44.940 --> 06:46.646
Okay.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.369
- ...cou/o’n’tﬁno’my...
- She can ’1' help you now, girl.

06:53.450 --> 06:55.941
- Hey.
- Yeah?

06:56.040 --> 06:57.951
They're good notes.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.337
We damn near lost the girl.

07:05.420 --> 07:08.127
But you didn't, so, it was a good day.

07:08.590 --> 07:12.424
Well, I don't think of it like that.
It's what we do.

07:13.970 --> 07:15.881
At least, you help people.

07:22.310 --> 07:25.814
I guess I've been a little fucked up
since Danny died.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.020
Just thinking about what this world

07:28.110 --> 07:30.237
I walk through every day
does to people.

07:31.030 --> 07:34.739
Danny was a good street cop.

07:34.830 --> 07:38.368
How the hell did he end up
swallowing his own gun?

07:40.210 --> 07:42.075
The city ruined him.

07:42.290 --> 07:44.747
I don't want that to happen to me.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.923
And now, please welcome
the sensational star

07:53.010 --> 07:57.674
of
Boys in the Sana;
Too’o’ Lang!

08:00.310 --> 08:03.097
- God damn!
- Come on!

08:03.230 --> 08:05.858
- Yeah, Daddy!
- All right!

08:06.860 --> 08:09.932
I got to see that body, baby!

08:14.490 --> 08:15.775
Now, take it off!

08:15.870 --> 08:18.612
- Abracadabra!
- Whoo!

08:42.980 --> 08:46.222
Hey. Here, read this.

08:46.900 --> 08:49.892
We can help you. Hey!

08:49.980 --> 08:53.359
Maybe you ought
to give it a rest for tonight.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.159
Or try another part of the stroll,
this spot's played out.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.946
- Where are your pamphlets?
- I put them away.

09:00.540 --> 09:03.703
- I gotta work.
- What do you mean?

09:03.790 --> 09:05.576
Work. I gotta earn.

09:05.670 --> 09:06.659
Not interested.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.832
- You can put it in your purse.
- I said no.

09:08.920 --> 09:10.660
Baby, Larry's not on me like he was,

09:10.760 --> 09:13.752
but I still need to help
with the rent.

09:13.840 --> 09:17.048
Hey, honey. Here you go. Read it.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.596
Girl, get this shit out my face.

09:18.930 --> 09:20.761
We don't want to see your kind
around here.

09:20.850 --> 09:23.592
I get it. Not everybody
wants to be helped.

09:23.680 --> 09:26.262
- It's not gonna stop me.
- Hey, listen to me. Listen to me.

09:26.350 --> 09:28.762
You need to be more careful
about how you act out here.

09:29.150 --> 09:33.849
I'm saying
you should be more quiet about it.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.481
Some of these pimps
might get the wrong idea,

09:37.570 --> 09:39.902
and it's the girls
who are gonna get cut.

09:40.990 --> 09:44.903
All right. All right, okay.

09:46.290 --> 09:50.249
Okay. Look, I gotta go.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.626
Where?

09:52.710 --> 09:54.758
To work.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.558
I loved watching you at the Gaiety.

10:03.640 --> 10:06.973
- You had moves.
- That's just rhythm.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.608
I was never good enough
to dance on Broadway.

10:09.690 --> 10:12.432
- You made money tonight, right?
- Yeah, I did okay.

10:12.530 --> 10:14.566
Between that and the in-calls,
I get by.

10:14.820 --> 10:16.981
You still hustling?

10:17.070 --> 10:20.153
Sure. There's plenty of wealthy
old queens and closeted businessmen

10:20.240 --> 10:22.697
who want to spend a few hours with me.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.707
Why wouldn't they? You're hot.

10:27.580 --> 10:31.698
- You're a star.
- Stars are rich.

10:31.790 --> 10:33.621
I was paid hundreds
for my best-known picture,

10:33.710 --> 10:37.294
and I have not seen
a penny from It smce.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.007
I'm always looking for my next gig.

10:39.090 --> 10:42.173
But you made it big, man.

10:42.260 --> 10:44.308
Did you ever think?

10:46.140 --> 10:49.268
I thought I would be an actor
in movies and plays.

10:49.810 --> 10:52.438
Instead, all people talk about
is the length of my cock.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.725
And its girth.

10:59.610 --> 11:03.865
Once you kiss another man onscreen,
you're in a box. Forever.

11:08.290 --> 11:11.498
for Rock Hudson and all those guys.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.548
Baby, they have to pretend.

11:16.800 --> 11:18.756
They're the ones in a box.

11:20.130 --> 11:21.210
You're free.

11:23.180 --> 11:27.844
You should enjoy it. Have fun.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.265
Okay?

11:30.600 --> 11:33.808
That's what this is all about? Fun?

11:40.450 --> 11:41.656
Yes.

11:43.700 --> 11:45.520
Rudy,
they were after your earner.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.497
I would never hit a made guy.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.616
Those idiot fucks _didn't even know
you were In the car.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.701
Ithought
we put all this nonsense behind us.

11:51.790 --> 11:54.452
- You wanna tell me who they were?
- I'll take care of it, Rudy.

11:54.540 --> 11:56.542
All right?
I promise, I'll take care of it.

11:56.630 --> 12:00.873
Wait, wait, wait.
Listen. As a gesture of good faith,

12:00.970 --> 12:02.961
I got this thing going on,
I might want to bring you in.

12:03.050 --> 12:05.211
You heard of this Lori Madison, right?

12:05.930 --> 12:09.479
She's a blonde.
She stars in these fuck films, okay?

12:09.560 --> 12:12.973
So, we're doing this picture,
I think it’s called
Red Hot.

12:13.060 --> 12:14.641
And she's like the girl next door.

12:14.730 --> 12:16.561
Except this girl next door,

12:16.650 --> 12:19.278
she could suck a golf ball
through a garden hose.

12:19.360 --> 12:22.067
Matty, I have money
in that picture, too.

12:22.150 --> 12:24.311
- You're shitting me.
- I own 25%.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.276
So, what? You want to cut me in
on something I already got a piece of?

12:27.370 --> 12:31.534
- Come on.
- No, no, not the picture. The actress.

12:31.620 --> 12:36.375
We're trying to sign her
to a multi-kind-of movie deal.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.239
You want me to be your partner?

12:38.340 --> 12:39.546
Sure, why not?

12:40.840 --> 12:42.080
Oh. On another note.

12:42.170 --> 12:46.209
That PR whatever-the-fuck-he-was
that used to drive you around?

12:46.300 --> 12:49.758
He's out on the street,
putting out feelers for a new job.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.169
Carlos, yeah.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.386
I had to let him go
on account of he's a lush.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.141
Is somebody looking to take him in?

12:55.230 --> 12:56.640
A Spanish?

12:56.730 --> 13:00.473
I mean, you and Martino,
you two guys are democratic.

13:00.570 --> 13:03.107
Me, I don't hire spics or jigs.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.021
And I certainly ain't gonna hire
a drunk. They got loose lips.

13:07.910 --> 13:11.573
- Good to know.
- I'll see you later.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.953
Doing some publicity for the movie
here, in New York,

13:15.040 --> 13:19.659
but I find that I'm spending
more and more time in LA.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.503
You should think about
planting your flag there, too.

13:22.590 --> 13:25.468
No, this is home. I like it here.

13:26.550 --> 13:28.541
Depends on what you want, I guess.

13:28.640 --> 13:30.926
Well, I want my picture to do well.

13:31.220 --> 13:34.348
If it does,
I could direct more movies.

13:34.440 --> 13:37.398
That's what I want,
I want to make more movies,

13:37.480 --> 13:40.313
and I want to keep
pushing the boundaries, you know?

13:40.690 --> 13:42.772
There ’5 already a buzz about
Red Hot.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.351
People have been talking about it
in meetings I've had,

13:45.450 --> 13:47.099
so you'd better be ready.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.771
How did you handle it
when it happened for you?

13:50.410 --> 13:53.902
It was not a question of handling it.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.787
Honey, I wanted it.

13:58.500 --> 14:01.492
I dreamed of being someone special
since I was a kid.

14:01.590 --> 14:04.627
So, when porn started blowing up,
I saw an open door.

14:04.720 --> 14:07.883
I knew I'd be good.
Not intimidated by the camera.

14:08.840 --> 14:12.059
- My body's made for this.
-Mmmmmm.

14:12.180 --> 14:15.672
Candy,
Red Hot

14:16.440 --> 14:18.840
it is going to elevate you
in our world.

14:19.400 --> 14:23.609
Your life's going to change.
You should embrace that.

14:26.860 --> 14:28.487
What?

14:28.570 --> 14:31.403
_ You realize that book
IS upSIde-down, don't you?

14:34.620 --> 14:37.783
I_see_.
On account of It might as well be

14:37.870 --> 14:40.748
because none of this shit's
getting through my thick skull?

14:41.250 --> 14:44.959
You've been staring at the same page
for about 15 minutes.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.961
I don't know.

14:48.050 --> 14:50.507
Why don't you give me
the CliffsNotes version, then.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.467
All modern Western philosophy

14:52.560 --> 14:56.678
is merely a footnote
to this man's work.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.597
Well, I beg to differ,

14:59.690 --> 15:02.568
but at least I don't gotta
read the rest of this shit.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.107
Sorry, Ab, I tried, but...

15:06.780 --> 15:08.441
Kant?

15:09.610 --> 15:11.271
Gave that one to you on a platter.

15:11.370 --> 15:14.828
You don't have to
do that for me, Vince.

15:14.910 --> 15:17.401
You want to know the truth?

15:17.500 --> 15:20.742
I couldn't
get through that book, either.

15:20.830 --> 15:22.536
Yeah, well,

15:25.000 --> 15:27.798
difference is, you wanted to.

15:27.880 --> 15:29.211
I could give two shits.

15:33.430 --> 15:36.137
Gotta get to the club.

15:54.950 --> 15:58.499
- She's worth this?
- Come on.

15:58.580 --> 16:02.459
Lori Madison is the next
adult film superstar.

16:02.540 --> 16:03.871
You can put your money on it.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.918
We are. But this?

16:07.130 --> 16:11.169
You're getting her acting services
for three feature films,

16:11.260 --> 16:15.344
plus, a first option on others,
if you so choose.

16:15.430 --> 16:16.590
I think it's more than fair.

16:16.890 --> 16:18.050
And what's your cut?

16:18.140 --> 16:19.596
None of your fucking business.

16:22.690 --> 16:25.306
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but this Madison broad

16:25.400 --> 16:26.606
is only gonna be in demand

16:26.690 --> 16:28.897
if the Red Riding Hood picture
takes off.

16:28.980 --> 16:31.232
So, what are we doing about that?

16:32.110 --> 16:34.943
Putting Hodas
and Harvey Wasserman on it.

16:35.030 --> 16:37.908
They'll run the distribution
and the marketing.

16:37.990 --> 16:40.538
And now that the picture's done,

16:40.620 --> 16:42.076
we'll take it out of the hands
of the director.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.788
- She made a good movie, but...
- Candy's smart.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.417
That doesn't mean she knows
the business end of it.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.127
We control the distribution.

16:49.460 --> 16:51.508
Us. Together.

16:51.590 --> 16:54.252
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

16:54.390 --> 16:55.379
There's one more thing.

17:02.640 --> 17:05.143
As long as he's in the picture,
she can't succeed,

17:05.230 --> 17:07.050
which means you lose, too.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.563
We need to separate them. Permanently.

17:10.650 --> 17:13.198
And what do you think
that means to a man like me?

17:13.280 --> 17:17.694
I'm asking you to buy him out.

17:17.780 --> 17:22.149
Now, I know you guys can handle that,
but it needs to be done right away.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.787
I'm taking Lori to LA,
and it would be nice for her

17:24.870 --> 17:28.249
if this was taken care of
before we leave.

17:29.420 --> 17:31.160
- There is a cheaper way.
- No.

17:31.260 --> 17:34.252
Do it clean. Please.

17:36.260 --> 17:37.420
Anything else?

17:37.510 --> 17:39.216
Yeah. What does a girl have to do

17:39.300 --> 17:41.131
to get another drink around here?

17:41.930 --> 17:44.979
You just sit there and be you.

17:47.230 --> 17:50.518
This is fun. Nobody has to get hurt,
just people fucking on film,

17:50.610 --> 17:52.987
and we take it
all the way to the bank.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.487
We're rolling... Hold on.

17:55.570 --> 17:57.481
- Okay, frame.
- Action.

18:05.290 --> 18:08.327
Dogs is after me. You gotta hide me.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.627
Papa says runaways should be shot.

18:10.710 --> 18:12.291
Your papa ain't here, girl.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.792
He's in the corral,
stump-breaking a mule.

18:15.010 --> 18:19.959
I cain't hide you.
If he finds out, he'll beat me.

18:20.050 --> 18:22.553
I'll be quiet. He won't know I'm here.

18:23.390 --> 18:24.470
Unless you tell him.

18:25.230 --> 18:27.266
You ain't gonna tell him, is you?

18:27.390 --> 18:30.393
You come any closer, I'll scream.

18:32.690 --> 18:36.353
If you don't come any closer,
I'll scream.

18:45.450 --> 18:46.451
I'll scream.

18:46.870 --> 18:51.375
I's gwanna make you scream, farm girl.

18:51.460 --> 18:53.166
What's "gwanna"?
What's that bullshit, "gwanna"?

18:53.250 --> 18:56.003
Cut. Say what's scripted, Larry.

18:56.090 --> 18:57.079
I know what's scripted.

18:57.220 --> 18:59.040
That's some coon-ass shit,
is what it is.

18:59.130 --> 19:02.463
It's the Civil War-era South.
That's how they talked back, then.

19:02.550 --> 19:03.551
"They"?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.130
Don't be so sensitive.
You know what I mean.

19:06.230 --> 19:10.644
Damn sure do.
So, here's how It's gonna go.

19:10.770 --> 19:14.399
My line is,
"I'm going to make you scream."

19:14.940 --> 19:16.567
And then speaking of lines,

19:16.650 --> 19:18.447
I notice that _
when they write my lines,

19:18.740 --> 19:20.810
they drop the Gs off the words.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.866
They don't do that with
the Caucasian actors.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.531
So, here on out,

19:25.620 --> 19:27.531
they write my lines
like you write their lines.

19:28.370 --> 19:31.874
Yeah? I'll be the one who decide if
I drop the Gs off my words or not.

19:33.630 --> 19:36.167
- Okay.
- Okay.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.165
Let's roll it.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.581
- Rick?
- What?

19:40.680 --> 19:43.092
Can I say "can't" instead of "cain't?"

19:46.010 --> 19:47.386
Oh, God.

19:47.930 --> 19:50.979
Obstruction of exits,
rodent infestation,

19:51.060 --> 19:53.722
congested storage facility,
rodent feces.

19:53.810 --> 19:56.187
We cite the hell out of them
for everything,

19:56.280 --> 19:57.315
try to wear them down.

19:57.820 --> 20:00.607
Here. Read this.

20:01.150 --> 20:04.028
It's a different tack.

20:05.530 --> 20:09.284
You're going directly to
the landlords with your summons.

20:09.370 --> 20:12.954
There're, what,
nine, ten violations here?

20:14.420 --> 20:17.457
What I don't get is,
three mortgage holders are listed.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.087
Only one legitimate bank.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.467
Shell companies.

20:22.010 --> 20:23.671
Shell companies.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.388
The property owners incorporate,

20:26.470 --> 20:29.018
and they have their lawyers
sign the papers of incorporation.

20:31.600 --> 20:33.340
Not to cast aspersion on your people,

20:33.440 --> 20:36.819
but I didn't expect to see
so many Jewish names.

20:36.900 --> 20:40.358
"Sol Gellman, Jerome Stein,
Benjamin Horowitz."

20:40.440 --> 20:42.146
There are a few Presbyterians
on there, too.

20:42.240 --> 20:43.605
Excuse me, Gene.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.692
But yeah,
a lot of Jews control the real estate.

20:46.780 --> 20:48.111
Thanks.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.327
That's Dr. Jerome Stein,

20:50.410 --> 20:53.618
a back surgeon with a practice
at 55th and Park.

20:54.790 --> 20:58.339
If I can expose the property owners
and bring them into court,

20:58.420 --> 21:00.081
then maybe I can get them out.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.539
To what end?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.507
Replace the sex-oriented businesses
with legitimate storefronts.

21:08.060 --> 21:13.009
That will increase the
speculative value of the real estate.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.681
It's how you clean things up.

21:15.520 --> 21:19.399
But it won't happen overnight.
You wanna hear more?

21:20.610 --> 21:22.316
I'm listening.

21:22.820 --> 21:26.404
So, you gentlemen
are saying $20,000 for Lori.

21:26.490 --> 21:29.197
We're saying $15.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.191
And you'd be renting her
for a few movies.

21:31.660 --> 21:35.414
We're buying her. Think of it
as us taking over her contract.

21:35.500 --> 21:38.492
Yeah? Well, I'd say
your offer's a little light.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.206
Hey, let's cut
the bullshit here, all right?

21:41.300 --> 21:43.336
You ain't seen that kind
of pocket cash in your life.

21:43.920 --> 21:47.959
Get a paint job for your Caddy.
Cover up that Bondo.

21:52.850 --> 21:54.727
I need to think on it.

21:55.770 --> 22:00.059
Let me be clear.
We're not here to negotiate.

22:03.740 --> 22:07.608
- $20,000.
- $15.

22:07.780 --> 22:09.691
Now, let's go in my car,
and make the deal.

22:14.710 --> 22:18.373
Go on. I'll be there in a minute.

22:18.460 --> 22:20.872
When I'm done with my shine.

22:38.770 --> 22:41.307
You are looking for a job.

22:41.400 --> 22:45.109
Yeah, but all these openings
are talking about a rsum.

22:46.780 --> 22:48.600
I don't have one.

22:48.700 --> 22:52.443
Saying, I never had a job before.
Not where you go to.

22:52.530 --> 22:54.612
For real?

22:54.700 --> 22:59.490
Never had to.
I live with my father and my sisters.

22:59.580 --> 23:03.994
But now, I'm thinking about moving out
and getting my own place.

23:04.090 --> 23:06.411
Gonna need steady money.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.922
Well, that's not how
you get a job, anyway.

23:09.010 --> 23:12.002
You turn in an application,
it goes onto a pile.

23:12.100 --> 23:15.888
Now, in my experience,
you get work by knowing someone.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.926
Connections.

23:19.520 --> 23:22.307
You have style, girl.
You know how to dress.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.685
Thank you.

23:24.780 --> 23:26.896
I'm just thinking, is all.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.948
My sister, Nadine, has
a used-clothing store in Brooklyn.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.775
Old sport jackets, dresses.

23:32.990 --> 23:35.197
It's a thing now
with the punk rock kids.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.281
- They are buying it all up.
- So?

23:37.870 --> 23:39.918
You know,
it's possible she could use some help.

23:40.750 --> 23:45.244
- I could ask her.
- Well, that's nice of you.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.456
Ah. You see? I'm not a bad guy.

23:47.550 --> 23:49.086
I knew that, but...

23:49.170 --> 23:53.209
I know, Dona. You have a man.

23:53.300 --> 23:55.757
Things could change.

23:55.850 --> 23:59.422
Life is long, Renton.
Or at least, it seems that way to me.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.727
You are telling me to have patience.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.779
Believe me, I do.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.425
Another Hennessy.
The XO tonight. I'm flush.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.170
Lori, another rum and Coke?

24:35.260 --> 24:37.137
Give her the high qual, too.

24:37.220 --> 24:39.677
Captain Morgan's or whatever.
We're celebrating.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.055
I asked Lori.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.267
That's fine. Anything.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.766
Got yourself straight
in the bathroom, huh?

24:48.400 --> 24:51.142
- I'm cool.
- Oh, I know you are.

24:51.900 --> 24:53.527
Headed for big things.

24:55.700 --> 24:59.818
Well, I'm good, too.

24:59.910 --> 25:02.287
Just so you know.

25:02.790 --> 25:06.248
I'm feeling
a little nostalgic and all,

25:07.540 --> 25:10.668
seeing as how you're about to embark
on your big adventure without me.

25:11.050 --> 25:13.757
That's why I got something special
planned for us.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.250
A little going-away present
just for you.

25:16.340 --> 25:19.173
- I don't want any gifts, C.C.
- Oh, no.

25:19.260 --> 25:22.309
No, I ain't get you nothing
from a store.

25:22.390 --> 25:23.630
But you gonna remember it.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.680
Everything all right?

25:29.770 --> 25:31.431
Mind your own.

25:37.990 --> 25:41.744
Got us a room, just like the old days.

25:43.540 --> 25:45.110
Gonna take a trip down memory lane.

25:48.250 --> 25:51.708
I'm gonna fuck you
like you never been fucked tonight.

25:53.590 --> 25:55.922
I'm gonna fuck you
like you never will be fucked again.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.806
Trying to leave C.C. behind?

26:03.230 --> 26:05.437
Don't you know
you always gonna be mine?

26:11.020 --> 26:14.023
You all right?
You never did answer the bartender.

26:17.070 --> 26:19.402
- I'm fine.
- Good.

26:20.700 --> 26:24.693
Drink up, girl.
We're gonna finish this evening right.

26:49.730 --> 26:52.358
You got a light?

26:52.900 --> 26:54.686
Sure.

27:07.750 --> 27:11.163
I'm a friend of Dorothy's.
You know her?

27:12.710 --> 27:14.246
I haven't heard that one in a while.

27:14.840 --> 27:18.298
Do I sound like a tourist?
In a way, I am.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.634
I'm in town for a fiction symposium
at NYU.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.928
- Staying at the Algonquin.
- Of course, you are.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.807
- The Gonk.
- I'm a writer.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.977
Not anyone you would've heard of.

27:32.060 --> 27:35.109
I've published a couple
of short stories in small rags.

27:38.700 --> 27:39.894
Yes.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.366
What?

27:44.080 --> 27:45.365
Yes.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.069
No kissing.

27:55.710 --> 27:57.792
That's the rule, right?

28:02.140 --> 28:04.176
I didn't say you could look at me.

28:04.930 --> 28:06.340
Get on all fours.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.881
- C.C...
- Girl, do it.

28:12.310 --> 28:14.107
I'm gonna fuck you like an animal now.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.509
C.C., wait. Come on, please...

28:15.610 --> 28:19.148
Damn. You dry as a nun, girl.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.738
Don't worry. I'm gonna loosen you up.

28:35.170 --> 28:39.413
- Do you have to go?
- I need to get home.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.830
Was everything okay?

28:47.100 --> 28:49.056
It was nice.

28:51.020 --> 28:54.057
When you say "home..."

28:54.150 --> 28:55.720
To my family.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.317
You know, when I first saw you,
I never figured you for a breeder.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.941
I'm an unreliable narrator.

29:06.740 --> 29:09.288
Isn't that what _
you literary types call It?

29:10.450 --> 29:13.954
Actually, you're in disguise.

29:14.040 --> 29:17.168
Personally, I could never
lead two lives.

29:17.250 --> 29:20.378
I mean, we don't
have to anymore, right?

29:21.920 --> 29:23.126
"We"?

29:23.550 --> 29:27.509
We're gay. Homosexual.

29:30.350 --> 29:31.977
I'm sexual.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.727
I'm a husband and a father.

29:36.860 --> 29:38.896
And I like to be with men.

29:39.900 --> 29:41.856
Don't try to make me into one thing.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.311
I didn't mean to offend you.

29:45.410 --> 29:46.775
You didn't.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.287
Not at all.

29:51.410 --> 29:54.243
Yeah, there's this movie
called
”Jee-Got. ”

29:54.330 --> 29:57.458
Gleason plays this mute
in Paris, France, like,

29:57.540 --> 30:00.839
you know, one of those clowns
that don't talk, he's like a bum.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.581
Who wants to watch a movie
with Jackie Gleason

30:02.670 --> 30:03.659
not saying nothing?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.967
You know,
I like the characters on his show,

30:06.050 --> 30:09.634
Reginald Van Gleason,
or Freddie the Freeloader.

30:09.720 --> 30:12.097
- Know whatI mean?
- I don't mean to eavesdrop,

30:12.180 --> 30:14.592
but Freddie the Freeloader
was a Red Skelton character,

30:14.680 --> 30:17.342
and the film
you ’re talking about is
quot.

30:18.400 --> 30:20.812
- Gigot.
- I mispronounced.

30:21.820 --> 30:24.357
To tell the truth,
I turned it off after 15 minutes.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.101
Too much pathos for you?

30:26.200 --> 30:28.065
Yeah, if "pathos" means "boring."

30:28.660 --> 30:31.197
Is my brother bothering you over here?

30:32.410 --> 30:35.368
You two are related?
I never would have guessed.

30:39.500 --> 30:40.626
Uh...

30:41.170 --> 30:42.205
I'll be back.

30:46.510 --> 30:50.344
So, film fan?

30:50.510 --> 30:52.000
I'm Victoria.

30:52.100 --> 30:53.419
Frankie Martino.

30:56.430 --> 30:59.228
So, have you ever
been to Paris, Frankie?

30:59.310 --> 31:02.973
No, I was stationed in Germany
for my whole tour there.

31:03.070 --> 31:05.140
Didn't see any action.

31:05.280 --> 31:08.101
Oh, I bet you saw some action.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.738
Yeah, well, the colored guys,
they cleaned up. I did all right.

31:12.990 --> 31:17.654
In fact, I did marry a German girl
for a hot minute.

31:17.750 --> 31:18.990
Really? What happened?

31:21.130 --> 31:23.200
Went kaput.

31:25.630 --> 31:26.870
So, I couldn't help but notice,

31:28.550 --> 31:31.257
you can't keep your eyes off me.

31:31.340 --> 31:35.458
Well, you're quite handsome.
And your hair, it's very current.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.846
Been going to the same barber
since I was a kid.

31:39.940 --> 31:42.010
Guess he caught up.

31:43.900 --> 31:48.519
So, listen, Victoria,
it's kind of loud in here.

31:48.610 --> 31:51.238
Maybe we could go somewhere
a little more quiet.

31:51.320 --> 31:55.108
Thank you, but I have to go.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.532
My husband waits up for me.

31:59.330 --> 32:02.322
But if you'd like to come and visit,

32:05.500 --> 32:08.162
I'm free after 9:00 am.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.832
Just give the doorman your name,
tell him you're a friend,

32:11.930 --> 32:14.342
and he will let you up.

32:19.310 --> 32:21.301
Riverside Drive. Nice.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.056
Yeah. It's very nice.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.108
Call me. I hope to see you soon.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.326
What happened to your friend?

32:39.950 --> 32:41.030
Boom.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.918
You already got the number?
Get the fuck outta here.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.206
I don't believe it.

32:45.290 --> 32:47.042
Believe it, brother.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.696
Big movie star.

33:21.910 --> 33:23.286
Thirty.

33:29.250 --> 33:30.877
Ten for the room.

33:32.420 --> 33:34.502
Trick-ass bitch.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.850
- Send him up.
- Very well.

33:52.940 --> 33:55.989
- Thank you, Thomas.
- Of course.

33:56.990 --> 33:58.059
You can go up.

33:58.870 --> 34:01.156
Thank you, Tommy.

34:04.660 --> 34:06.457
Don't stop.

34:06.540 --> 34:09.873
Oh, God. You're so thick.

34:09.960 --> 34:11.700
- Like that?
- Yes!

34:11.800 --> 34:14.121
Oh, God. Oh! I'm gonna come.

34:14.220 --> 34:16.006
- Okay.
- I'm coming.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.039
- Yes! _
- At your serwce.

34:21.510 --> 34:22.636
Oh, God!

34:25.060 --> 34:26.300
Here you go, miss.

34:26.390 --> 34:29.109
Hello. Thank you.
There are four in the back.

34:29.190 --> 34:31.317
Be careful of the Yves Saint Laurent.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.392
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

34:34.490 --> 34:36.697
Come on, we're already late.

34:41.280 --> 34:42.907
Can you put them on the cart for me?

34:42.990 --> 34:45.117
- Of course.
- Thank you.

34:51.920 --> 34:55.504
He's not here, Lori.
He's out of your life. Come on.

34:55.590 --> 34:58.218
Come on, the gate's gonna close, babe.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.842
- Thank you so much.
- Here you go, miss.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.098
All those people,
where they going?

35:07.190 --> 35:10.011
To work, probably,
or to a meeting somewhere.

35:10.100 --> 35:13.399
- Don't you have a job?
- Yeah, I work. At my own pace.

35:13.480 --> 35:16.108
Never catch me goose-stepping
down the sidewalk like that.

35:16.530 --> 35:19.488
I don't have the kind of job
I can't leave if I don't like it.

35:19.570 --> 35:23.984
I don't gotta wait around
to collect a pension. No pressure.

35:24.120 --> 35:26.657
So, what's going to happen to you
when you get old?

35:33.000 --> 35:37.369
Frankie Martino, old?
I can't picture it.

35:39.630 --> 35:41.461
Well, I have to tidy up
before my husband gets back.

35:42.260 --> 35:44.387
You'd better go.

35:53.770 --> 35:55.146
See you.

35:57.360 --> 35:59.601
You want something? Coffee?

35:59.700 --> 36:00.985
I don't want anything.

36:01.070 --> 36:03.402
Well, sit there and listen, then.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.788
And stop being such a stubborn bitch.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.452
Y'all are pissed off at me, too.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.916
You're making the wrong people angry.

36:13.460 --> 36:14.495
What's your point?

36:15.380 --> 36:18.452
The truce we made over _
at the apartments, that was something.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.257
I mean, considering the type of people
we're dealing with here,

36:21.340 --> 36:22.546
I'd say it was a lot.

36:23.720 --> 36:25.711
But you can't push it any further
with those guys.

36:25.810 --> 36:28.347
Why not? I'm not trying to put
the pimps out of business.

36:28.430 --> 36:31.342
If a few of their girls want out,
why wouldn't they let them out?

36:31.440 --> 36:34.182
There are plenty more
where they came from.

36:34.690 --> 36:36.066
You know as well as I do,

36:36.150 --> 36:38.937
it's not about losing one girl
and replacing her with another.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.100
It's about control and power.

36:41.200 --> 36:42.189
When it comes down to it,

36:42.280 --> 36:44.316
these assholes don't like
to be disrespected.

36:44.410 --> 36:46.025
Well, fuck what they don't like.

36:46.410 --> 36:47.866
"Fuck what they don't like"?

36:47.950 --> 36:50.828
We don't operate with that kind
of careless disregard...

36:50.910 --> 36:53.822
Well, maybe you should.
Maybe you would change a few lives.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.410
Listen to me.

36:55.500 --> 36:58.333
My kind of activism is helping
the women on a broader level,

36:58.420 --> 37:00.126
and it's not putting anyone in danger.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.299
I got big love for you, Dave,
but you can't do what I do.

37:05.390 --> 37:07.005
And I don't have the patience
to wait around

37:07.100 --> 37:08.749
for politicians to make new laws.

37:08.850 --> 37:11.091
That takes years,
if it happens at all.

37:11.180 --> 37:13.387
I can help these girls today.

37:13.480 --> 37:17.473
You're not helping.
You're negatively impacting my work.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.857
I can't be aligned with you anymore.

37:22.820 --> 37:23.855
What are you doing?

37:25.700 --> 37:27.190
I'm out.

37:27.580 --> 37:28.774
What?

37:36.330 --> 37:38.207
I know what I'm doing.

37:45.550 --> 37:47.381
I love you, girl.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.593
So, what you got left?
That trick with the gap in her teeth?

37:56.690 --> 37:57.805
Melissa earns.

37:57.900 --> 37:59.015
Mmm-hmm.

37:59.730 --> 38:01.186
One girl.

38:01.280 --> 38:03.100
Might as well marry the bitch
and retire.

38:03.190 --> 38:04.350
I could retire.

38:04.450 --> 38:06.941
Them Italians gave me 50
for the rights to Lori.

38:07.490 --> 38:10.323
- Fifty motherfucking dollars, huh?
- Don't be funny.

38:11.490 --> 38:13.321
I could take a trip right the fuck now
ifI wanted to.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.748
- Yeah.
- Go back to the motherland, maybe.

38:18.830 --> 38:21.913
Shit. Now, you one of them
Back-to-Africa motherfuckers.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.082
No, this here's my home,
and I like to work.

38:24.170 --> 38:25.250
Mmm-hmm.

38:25.930 --> 38:27.716
Gonna find me some new bitches
and run them.

38:28.300 --> 38:29.506
That's what the fuck I do.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.512
Don't make no sense to recruit
If all's they do IS run away.

38:32.600 --> 38:36.388
Chocolate didn't just run away.
She got pushed.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.552
That's why I asked you gentlemen
to join me here tonight.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.857
We have a situation
we need to address.

38:41.940 --> 38:44.738
That West Virginia ho of yours
came back to New York,

38:44.820 --> 38:46.981
acting like Gloria Steinem and shit.

38:47.150 --> 38:48.902
She instigating all kinds of shit.

38:48.990 --> 38:50.821
Her and Larry Brown's bitch,
the Puerto Rican.

38:50.910 --> 38:52.116
We can't be having that.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.998
Yeah, well, you can't touch Loretta.
She ain't yours.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.365
Your ex-bitch, then.

38:59.210 --> 39:00.837
Girl's got fire.

39:01.920 --> 39:06.084
We need to send a message.
Can't nobody misdirect our women.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.585
You know what?

39:10.890 --> 39:12.960
You need to be smart, Julito.

39:14.180 --> 39:17.343
Street bitches disappear every day,
ain't nobody give a fuck, for real.

39:18.730 --> 39:21.551
But Ashley, she's a civilian.

39:22.820 --> 39:26.278
She gets found dead, you gonna
bring down heat on all of us.

39:26.650 --> 39:28.777
That means we lose money.

39:30.360 --> 39:34.069
Don't make me no difference.
I'll kill the bitch.

39:34.160 --> 39:36.742
You ain't killing no-goddamn-body.
You can't even tie your shoes.

39:39.000 --> 39:41.241
Man, motherfuck you.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.950
We got to do something.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.455
I say no.

39:47.470 --> 39:51.509
Marty, I don't want Little Red
handcuffed to the bedposts.

39:52.010 --> 39:53.466
Some of your ideas are good.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.302
I'll have my artist
take another crack at the poster.

39:56.140 --> 39:58.722
Don't forget to make my Wolf black.

39:58.930 --> 40:04.311
Look, I got nothing against
the shvoogies, Candy,

40:04.400 --> 40:06.641
but our partners
are never gonna go for it.

40:06.730 --> 40:08.857
I had an incident with them recently.

40:09.110 --> 40:10.600
They were very emotional.

40:13.370 --> 40:14.439
I don't want to go there again.

40:15.160 --> 40:18.038
- Anything else on your mind?
- How are the bookings going?

40:18.120 --> 40:20.998
We're about to strike prints.
Word of mouth is strong.

40:21.080 --> 40:24.163
I'm gonna get you into some of
the best skin houses in the country.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.160
You're in good hands.

40:26.500 --> 40:29.913
Now, I have a question for you,
if you don't mind.

40:30.010 --> 40:31.079
No, go ahead.

40:31.800 --> 40:35.759
Lori Madison. I'm guessing
she's, what, like, a B-cup?

40:35.850 --> 40:37.886
I'd like to enhance her a bit
for the poster.

40:37.970 --> 40:40.939
Make her a D.
You know, big boobs sell tickets.

40:41.440 --> 40:43.260
Any objection to that?

40:49.610 --> 40:51.646
You gonna go out there and get it?

40:51.740 --> 40:53.105
- Yes, Daddy.
- Yeah?

40:53.200 --> 40:54.315
Mmm-hmm.

40:54.410 --> 40:57.618
Me, too. Always hustling.

40:57.700 --> 41:00.863
About to track down Lori's royalties
on that movie.

41:02.670 --> 41:04.877
Yo, I put that dog in the bathroom,
Melissa. Get rid of it.

41:06.590 --> 41:08.410
You mean...

41:08.500 --> 41:12.163
I ain't cold like that. Come on.
Sell it, or some shit.

41:13.010 --> 41:14.170
Yeah, okay.

41:15.390 --> 41:17.881
It was Lori's, aanay.

41:20.390 --> 41:23.097
You know, I don't even miss her.

41:24.440 --> 41:28.012
You cannot go out with
a loose button like this.

41:28.110 --> 41:30.396
You want me to sew it up,
tighten it up a little?

41:30.480 --> 41:33.483
Later. When I come home tonight.

41:34.030 --> 41:37.443
Then I'm gonna take care of you
the way only C.C. know how to do.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.240
You my bottom, Melissa, you know this.

41:48.250 --> 41:49.797
I know it, C.C.

41:59.390 --> 42:01.711
Dile... Dilau...

42:02.850 --> 42:04.181
Dilaudid.

42:04.270 --> 42:08.309
Whatever it's called,
it's some good shit.

42:08.400 --> 42:12.188
- Better than morphine.
- Yeah.

42:15.070 --> 42:16.901
Can you get some more?

42:19.620 --> 42:23.442
Next time they have
one of those free clinics, I guess.

42:23.700 --> 42:25.998
That's where you scored?

42:26.080 --> 42:28.571
The pharmacist that they had.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.917
Told him I had back pain,
it wouldn't go away.

42:32.130 --> 42:35.213
We should pay that doctor a visit.

42:35.340 --> 42:38.298
He's got a store on the West Side.

42:38.390 --> 42:40.005
Another drug store?

42:42.510 --> 42:43.886
Uh-huh.

42:44.180 --> 42:45.340
Yeah?

42:47.190 --> 42:48.555
Cool.

42:49.860 --> 42:52.511
Yeah, I was gonna stop by
and see my folks.

42:52.610 --> 42:54.487
- It's been a while.
- Cool.

42:57.530 --> 43:00.021
Vincent. I'm looking to
get up with your brother.

43:00.740 --> 43:03.117
- You making book now, too?
- No, not me.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.363
It's about the movie he produced.
The one Candy directed.

43:06.460 --> 43:07.666
Yeah?

43:07.750 --> 43:09.160
I wanna speak to Frankie
about Lori's cut.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.241
You don't know where I can find him,
do you?

43:11.340 --> 43:12.409
I don't.

43:12.500 --> 43:15.253
I heard he married that dancer.
She's got her own place, right?

43:15.340 --> 43:16.580
Yeah, they broke up.

43:17.380 --> 43:20.588
Okay. Where does Frankie
hang his hat these days?

43:20.680 --> 43:23.638
You got me.
Wherever the wind takes him, I guess.

43:25.020 --> 43:28.342
You know, he's tight with
your redneck brother-in-law.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.183
Maybe I'll ask Dvwer.
Though I don't think he likes me much.

43:32.730 --> 43:33.856
Imagine that.

43:38.700 --> 43:40.099
You have a good day, young lady.

43:55.380 --> 43:57.757
- How you doing?
- Hi.

43:57.840 --> 44:00.172
I was wondering,

44:00.260 --> 44:02.387
is this good for your back?

44:02.470 --> 44:06.258
- My mother. Chronical pain.
- Oh. It should help.

44:06.350 --> 44:10.764
Watch her dosage. Too much
can be rough on the stomach.

44:13.060 --> 44:16.279
How about something stronger,
like Dilaudid?

44:16.650 --> 44:19.448
You mean hydromorphone.

44:19.530 --> 44:22.408
Dilaudid is a brand name
for hydromorphone.

44:22.490 --> 44:25.618
And, yes, that can be
an effective pain reliever.

44:25.700 --> 44:26.780
But you'd need a prescription.

44:27.450 --> 44:29.190
Yeah, I know that.

44:29.290 --> 44:32.362
But you got it here, right?
You carry it?

44:34.080 --> 44:35.991
You'd need a prescription.

44:38.880 --> 44:40.586
Okay, Doc...

44:45.800 --> 44:47.552
Thanks for the information.

44:52.900 --> 44:55.607
Eat your sandwich, too,
not just the onion dip.

44:56.020 --> 44:59.604
- But it's good.
- I know.

45:05.700 --> 45:08.191
So, I'm gonna be
out of town next month.

45:08.290 --> 45:10.281
Like a business trip?

45:10.370 --> 45:11.906
Yeah.

45:12.000 --> 45:15.458
Yeah, I'm gonna be promoting
the film I made, the one I directed.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.043
It’s called
Red Hot.

45:18.550 --> 45:21.713
It’s
Little Red Riding Hood

45:21.800 --> 45:23.290
an updated version.

45:24.300 --> 45:27.929
But this is a fairy tale for grownups.

45:28.260 --> 45:30.808
Mom, you don't have to use
little kid words.

45:30.890 --> 45:32.221
You mean it's for adults, right?

45:33.600 --> 45:35.807
It's rated "R"?

45:35.900 --> 45:38.562
That means I can see it,
if you go with me.

45:38.900 --> 45:42.893
No. This one's not appropriate
for a guy your age.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.946
Maybe you could see it someday.

45:48.080 --> 45:49.570
Like the 12th of Never?

45:52.160 --> 45:56.699
Anyway, just wanted to let you know
why I'll be out of town.

45:59.170 --> 46:00.580
I'm gonna be selling my movie.

46:00.670 --> 46:03.468
- So, if it's not an "R..."
- Well, I didn't say that.

46:03.550 --> 46:04.869
Then it's an "X"?

46:06.090 --> 46:08.138
Actually, it doesn't have
a rating yet, Adam.

46:09.390 --> 46:11.551
When I get back
and I can relax a little,

46:11.640 --> 46:13.471
how about you and me go on a vacation?

46:13.560 --> 46:16.518
For real, like, go to
the Jersey Shore, or something.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.569
- Would you like that?
- Could Nana come, too?

46:21.320 --> 46:23.185
Yeah, if she wants to.

46:25.860 --> 46:27.987
Thanks, Adam,

46:30.080 --> 46:32.150
but I gotta stay home
and take care of your grandfather.

46:32.490 --> 46:34.742
If I don't cook dinner, he don't eat.

46:34.830 --> 46:37.367
Where would we go, exactly?

46:37.460 --> 46:42.124
I don't know. I've been hearing
about this place called Margate.

46:42.210 --> 46:45.509
- I never stayed at the beach before.
- Yeah, neither have I.

46:48.010 --> 46:52.253
If they want me to be
in their movie, they have to listen.

46:53.350 --> 46:56.808
I model my shit off of Woody Strode.

46:56.890 --> 46:58.721
That man had dignity.

47:07.360 --> 47:09.612
One tuna on wheat toast
with fries,

47:09.700 --> 47:11.907
and a cheeseburger platter
with onion rings.

47:11.990 --> 47:14.993
Tuna, wheat, fries,
CB and rings. Got it.

47:21.460 --> 47:22.529
Long time, Barbie.

47:23.000 --> 47:24.547
Yeah, I been upstate.

47:27.010 --> 47:28.420
You look hungry.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.257
Barely afford a cup of coffee, Leon.

47:31.350 --> 47:34.251
Girl, don't worry. I got you.

47:36.480 --> 47:40.598
And your brother? Where's he?

47:40.690 --> 47:42.430
In the wind.

47:46.740 --> 47:47.809
What you got?

47:49.570 --> 47:52.812
Oh, provolone, nice.
That's from Manganaro's?

47:53.620 --> 47:54.860
Where else?

47:56.450 --> 47:59.078
What, they only sold you part
of the loaf of this bread?

48:01.580 --> 48:03.992
I tore the heel off,
I ate it on the walk home.

48:04.090 --> 48:07.582
Of course you did, buttagots.
You had to have a chew on the heel.

48:10.260 --> 48:12.546
Just like when you were little, right?

48:12.840 --> 48:14.250
Look, Pop,

48:17.310 --> 48:19.847
I'm having, you know, a hard time.

48:19.940 --> 48:21.646
You don't look it.

48:21.730 --> 48:24.972
I see the clothes, the jewelry.
You're raking it in, Vinnie.

48:26.150 --> 48:29.062
I was hoping to get some advice.
About women.

48:29.150 --> 48:32.904
You think I know about women?
Give me one of those.

48:37.950 --> 48:40.248
- What is it?
- Abby.

48:40.330 --> 48:41.866
Yeah.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.376
Well,

48:46.250 --> 48:48.457
she's a smart girl.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.336
She's very pretty.

48:50.420 --> 48:52.752
I love her.
But she don't want what I want.

48:53.180 --> 48:54.636
Which is what?

48:54.720 --> 48:57.507
A regular home. Family, maybe.

48:57.600 --> 48:59.807
Well, Vinnie, you have a family.

49:02.230 --> 49:03.686
You seen your kids lately?

49:03.770 --> 49:04.976
No.

49:06.690 --> 49:08.317
Hey, you wanted everything.

49:08.400 --> 49:11.233
A woman at home, pussy on the side.
Like most men.

49:11.400 --> 49:12.606
Except most men don't leave.

49:12.700 --> 49:14.861
Me and Andrea, we're not compatible.

49:14.950 --> 49:18.329
What the fuck does compatible
got to do with it? Compatible. What?

49:18.410 --> 49:21.902
Vinnie, you can't control your urges.
You never have.

49:22.460 --> 49:23.950
What do you think,
you think you're alone?

49:25.040 --> 49:27.201
Hey. You know,

49:28.300 --> 49:30.006
I'm no true blue.

49:30.090 --> 49:32.581
- You know that, right?
- Yeah...

49:34.380 --> 49:36.382
When I was a teenager,
I saw you in this bar

49:36.470 --> 49:40.019
on Fourth Avenue one night
with Mrs. DiPieri.

49:40.180 --> 49:42.091
Saw the way her eyes were shining
when she was looking at you.

49:42.180 --> 49:43.226
I knew what that look meant.

49:43.890 --> 49:46.438
Sherry DiPieri wasn't the only one,
that's not even what I'm trying...

49:46.520 --> 49:48.226
Pop, I don't need to hear
about all this.

49:48.320 --> 49:50.720
Hey, you asked my advice.
I'm trying to level with you.

49:50.820 --> 49:55.655
Do you wanna talk?
I had others. Yeah, I had others.

49:55.780 --> 49:58.863
Some nice women, you know,
we had some laughs.

49:58.950 --> 50:03.649
Compared to the mother
of my ch/ldren, l/Innie,
puttanas.

50:03.790 --> 50:06.031
I did what I did
to make myself feel like a man.

50:06.120 --> 50:08.873
And I'd come home. I came home.

50:11.000 --> 50:14.083
I had you boys,
I had your sister to take care of.

50:14.170 --> 50:17.674
But, Vinnie,
I never considered leaving.

50:19.050 --> 50:20.802
Not once.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.222
So, you're saying I fucked up.

50:25.190 --> 50:28.853
It's never too late to make amends,
that's all.

50:30.570 --> 50:33.937
Hey. Let's take this in
to your mother.

50:34.820 --> 50:39.189
You know, you called,
she started cooking.

50:39.280 --> 50:40.907
It's all right. You explain to her

50:40.990 --> 50:42.537
why you bought her only
half a loaf of that bread.

50:42.620 --> 50:44.702
All right? Buttagots!

51:05.350 --> 51:06.681
Barbara.

51:09.520 --> 51:12.432
- I ain't know you was out.
- How would you know?

51:14.070 --> 51:18.029
You never answered my letters, Larry.
Not one.

51:18.110 --> 51:22.069
You never visited me.
Not once.

51:25.000 --> 51:27.821
What good would that have done?

51:27.910 --> 51:28.990
Hmm?

51:30.130 --> 51:33.622
If I thought you was weak,
I would've come by.

51:33.880 --> 51:37.168
But I knew you didn't need me.
You was always strong.

51:37.260 --> 51:39.581
So, you threw me away
'cause I could carry it?

51:40.590 --> 51:42.797
There wasn't a day that went by
I didn't think about you.

51:42.890 --> 51:44.426
Bullshit!

51:48.810 --> 51:50.687
What you got on you, Larry?

51:51.230 --> 51:53.107
I know you always carry a roll.

51:54.190 --> 51:55.225
Give it here.

52:12.040 --> 52:13.667
All of it.

52:17.380 --> 52:19.962
Meatloaf platter with corn.
Burger, hold the cheese.

52:20.050 --> 52:22.041
Extra crispy on the fries.

52:22.140 --> 52:24.210
Special with corn.
Hamburger, extra crispy.

52:24.300 --> 52:25.881
On it.

52:36.190 --> 52:37.316
Melissa still out there?

52:37.860 --> 52:39.646
Oh, she's with CO, now.

52:41.280 --> 52:42.816
You want to know where she stay at?

52:43.160 --> 52:44.479
No.

52:44.570 --> 52:48.904
I don't want her to see me like this.
Just tell her I was asking after her.

52:55.710 --> 52:57.371
Why she asking about Melissa?

52:57.460 --> 52:58.916
They were lovers, Larry.

53:01.220 --> 53:02.585
While she was with me?

53:07.430 --> 53:09.921
Just the man I want to see.

53:10.020 --> 53:12.306
No pimps in here. You know the rules.

53:12.390 --> 53:13.800
Does that include you?

53:16.110 --> 53:19.182
I mean, you the squarest pimp
I ever did see,

53:19.280 --> 53:20.736
but a pimp is what you are.

53:22.070 --> 53:23.526
Watch it.

53:24.490 --> 53:28.859
A few moments of your time, Frankie.
You and I have business to discuss.

53:32.830 --> 53:34.491
All right. In the back.

53:42.010 --> 53:46.049
- Who's working?
- Besides me? Marilys and Elise.

53:46.140 --> 53:49.257
The three of you, take a break.
Go get some lunch or something.

53:49.350 --> 53:51.671
I don't want the girls seeing
that piece of shit in the parlor,

53:51.770 --> 53:53.306
or me breaking my own rules.

53:56.860 --> 53:59.567
Stay out here. Tell the customers
we're temporarily closed.

53:59.650 --> 54:00.776
You got it, boss.

54:07.660 --> 54:09.696
It's kind of shabby in here.

54:09.780 --> 54:13.455
- This your idea of an office?
- Serves its purpose.

54:13.540 --> 54:15.030
That's a nice uniform
you got on.

54:15.120 --> 54:17.122
Shouldn't you have your name
embroidered across your chest?

54:19.250 --> 54:20.626
Say what you came here for.

54:22.960 --> 54:26.589
Lori Madison and me,
we ended our business arrangement.

54:27.840 --> 54:31.139
But I still own a piece
of her previous work, in perpetuity.

54:31.220 --> 54:34.929
What you producers call my points.

54:35.020 --> 54:37.090
I'm talking specifically
about your movie,
Red Hot.

54:37.520 --> 54:40.011
Yeah, well, the movie
hasn't been released yet,

54:40.110 --> 54:41.600
so there's no profits.

54:41.690 --> 54:44.568
Or what do you call that? Back end.

54:44.780 --> 54:47.408
Not till we get the receipts,
and that could be months away.

54:47.490 --> 54:49.526
Yeah. I realize that.

54:50.490 --> 54:52.867
I came here for an advance.

54:52.950 --> 54:56.033
On, you know, my future earnings.

54:56.580 --> 54:58.286
We don't have it.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.950
You have it.

55:00.710 --> 55:02.917
Your Irish brother-in-law here,
and all you Italians,

55:03.000 --> 55:04.831
you printing money in these parlors.

55:04.920 --> 55:06.581
You heard him.
He said he doesn't have it.

55:06.680 --> 55:09.501
I'll take 10,000. Today.

55:09.590 --> 55:11.000
You'll take it out
on the fucking arches.

55:11.100 --> 55:14.342
And stop it with the lighter.
It's bothering me.

55:27.110 --> 55:28.236
I'm not gonna tell you again.

55:28.660 --> 55:31.151
I'm not listening to that,
or any more of your bullshit.

55:31.450 --> 55:34.032
No. You'll listen.

55:35.000 --> 55:36.570
And you'll like it.

55:39.620 --> 55:41.668
You fucking
many bitches in here, Bobby?

55:45.210 --> 55:46.290
Your wife know?

55:47.970 --> 55:49.756
Maybe I should just let her in
on your little secret.

55:51.050 --> 55:54.713
Or y'all could pay me.
Right now. Today.

55:55.180 --> 55:56.215
Fuck you.

55:56.310 --> 55:59.939
Yeah, I seen your wife at The Hi-Hat.
Yeah.

56:00.060 --> 56:02.893
She's got some nice,
round titties on her, boy.

56:03.110 --> 56:04.850
You know? Whoo!

56:04.940 --> 56:06.680
I wouldn't mind
hitting that ass myself.

56:09.110 --> 56:10.407
Shit.

56:38.480 --> 56:39.515
Frankie!

56:40.770 --> 56:42.089
Frankie!

56:52.200 --> 56:53.406
Damn.

56:56.160 --> 56:58.651
Y'all murdered the shit
out that motherfucker.

57:02.210 --> 57:03.700
Get a tarp.

57:11.670 --> 57:13.297
What happened?

57:15.890 --> 57:17.710
He talked too much.
