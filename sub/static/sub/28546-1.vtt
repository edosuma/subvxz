01:27.880 --> 01:29.930
Michael, do not slam the door.

02:24.042 --> 02:25.534
You can't do it like.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.028
You can't do it like.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.020
You can't do it like.

02:29.022 --> 02:30.514
You can't do it like.

02:30.516 --> 02:32.506
You can't do it like.

02:32.508 --> 02:34.000
You can't do it like.

02:34.002 --> 02:35.992
You can't do it like.

02:35.994 --> 02:37.984
You can't do it like.

02:37.986 --> 02:39.478
You can't do it like.

02:39.480 --> 02:40.972
You can't do it like I did.

02:40.974 --> 02:42.964
You can't do it like.

02:42.966 --> 02:44.458
You can't do it like I did.

02:44.460 --> 02:46.450
You can't do it like.

02:46.452 --> 02:47.944
You can't do it like I did.

02:47.946 --> 02:49.438
You can't do it like.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.432
You can't do it like I did.

03:28.890 --> 03:30.018
Do yoga or something.

03:30.020 --> 03:32.388
It's not the best
place to hangout.

03:32.390 --> 03:39.607
So we were shooting this
crazy car scene, explosions

03:39.609 --> 03:41.898
everywhere, and this big
piece of shrapnel hit my hand.

03:41.900 --> 03:43.483
I had to go to hospital.

03:43.485 --> 03:45.099
And for four weeks...

03:45.101 --> 03:45.598
in a cast.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.768
It was crazy.

03:46.770 --> 03:47.548
What do you do?

03:47.550 --> 03:48.838
I'm a filmmaker too.

03:48.840 --> 03:51.508
I'm an independent
filmmaker here in Portland.

03:51.510 --> 03:53.068
I'm looking to
get into features.

03:53.070 --> 03:55.688
I've only made shorts so far.

03:55.690 --> 04:00.818
But I have an idea
for a feature film,

04:00.820 --> 04:02.963
and I'd love to
share it with you.

04:02.965 --> 04:04.448
OK.

04:04.450 --> 04:05.838
I'm listening.

04:05.840 --> 04:06.768
OK.

04:06.770 --> 04:10.268
Well, in short it's about an
artist and her love affair

04:10.270 --> 04:12.788
with the city of Portland.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.887
Different color schemes
throughout the film

04:14.889 --> 04:20.278
would represent the different
stages of her relationship.

04:20.279 --> 04:23.350
And... that's it?

04:23.352 --> 04:27.627
Well, of course, there's
their love story, which

04:27.629 --> 04:28.920
follows the voyage of the hero.

04:33.650 --> 04:40.058
I don't see it being
viable, but good luck!

04:40.060 --> 04:45.248
So anyway, we had this
great, crazy boat,

04:45.250 --> 04:47.026
and we were like, all on it.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.138
I can't make a story.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.864
I can't make a story.

05:05.818 --> 05:07.306
I definitely fucked it up.

05:15.770 --> 05:19.188
No, I just had the
worst performance...

05:19.190 --> 05:20.618
Hey, I know you.

05:20.620 --> 05:23.488
I think you might
think I'm someone else.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.408
No, no.

05:24.410 --> 05:25.940
The festival a
couple of months ago.

05:37.110 --> 05:38.218
Oh, hey, Louisa.

05:38.220 --> 05:40.503
This is Raiyah, she's another
producer director here.

05:40.505 --> 05:41.378
Hi, nice to meet you.

05:41.380 --> 05:42.408
Nice to meet you.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.668
Hi, and this is Luke,
he's the composer

05:44.670 --> 05:46.622
for my current documentary.

05:50.794 --> 05:53.345
I know, that's what I
like about coming here.

06:27.540 --> 06:29.328
It's weird seeing you here.

06:29.330 --> 06:30.983
You must be from Portland.

06:30.985 --> 06:33.118
No, I'm actually from Seattle.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.516
I was just here for a
performance, I'm a pianist.

06:36.518 --> 06:39.508
Oh, nice.

06:39.510 --> 06:42.868
Sorry about the phone
thing, I was just

06:42.870 --> 06:44.163
going through some things.

06:44.165 --> 06:45.288
What are you going through?

06:45.290 --> 06:47.818
If you don't mind me asking.

06:47.820 --> 06:50.738
A lot.

06:50.740 --> 06:52.508
I really fucked up
that performance.

06:52.510 --> 06:55.898
But then again, I
don't know if it's

06:55.900 --> 06:59.660
just like over analyzing
self-deprecation stuff.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.268
I definitely fucked it up.

07:06.270 --> 07:09.558
I feel in a very
similar place right now,

07:09.560 --> 07:11.988
but I'm sure mine is worse.

07:11.990 --> 07:12.738
Oh yeah?

07:12.740 --> 07:13.781
What's going on with you?

07:18.160 --> 07:21.344
Basically I'm a failure.

07:21.346 --> 07:22.220
I think I can relate.

07:24.848 --> 07:27.868
I should go.

07:27.870 --> 07:29.588
Can I at least get your name?

07:29.590 --> 07:31.544
I'm Louisa.

07:31.546 --> 07:33.478
Luke.

07:33.480 --> 07:36.208
Maybe when I'm back in town
we could go for a drink,

07:36.210 --> 07:39.398
can I get your number?

07:39.400 --> 07:40.874
Sure.

07:40.876 --> 07:41.376
Cool.

07:47.147 --> 07:47.978
Well, give it to me.

07:52.848 --> 07:53.348
Here.

07:58.716 --> 07:59.692
Thank you.

08:06.050 --> 08:07.036
Goodnight.

08:22.130 --> 08:23.838
Stop picking.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
I'm not picking.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.258
Yes, you are.

08:29.260 --> 08:31.404
Don't do it.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.928
You have to stay on
your side of the bed.

08:47.930 --> 08:49.838
Don't touch me.

08:49.840 --> 08:54.619
I drew a line down the
center, so don't cross it.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.430
I don't want it to look
like everyone else.

09:56.010 --> 09:58.170
I don't want ropes
and whips and stuff.

10:01.860 --> 10:03.870
I've never done this.

11:00.291 --> 11:00.790
Sylvia.

11:19.460 --> 11:22.698
But you're not trying
to touch me at all.

11:23.500 --> 11:24.708
There's nothing I
can do to stop you.

11:24.710 --> 11:24.808
The I all of a sudden
get you, I know.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.628
Ow!

11:26.630 --> 11:27.128
I'm sorry.

11:27.130 --> 11:28.138
No, it's all right.

11:28.140 --> 11:32.218
July 15th, dreams are
better than memories,

11:32.220 --> 11:34.438
because memories, I
will forget them all.

12:00.110 --> 12:01.350
Hi, this is Luke.

12:40.455 --> 12:43.508
I have an addictive personality.

12:43.510 --> 12:46.618
I think that I do too.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.918
What are you addicted to?

12:48.920 --> 12:52.418
Mostly sensation.

12:52.420 --> 12:56.418
Not even sure what
that means, really.

12:56.420 --> 12:59.418
What about you?

12:59.420 --> 13:03.418
Well no hard drugs.

13:03.420 --> 13:05.918
Nicotine, obviously.

13:05.920 --> 13:09.926
But it's not that bad,
just like two packs a week.

13:09.928 --> 13:14.483
But I think primarily I'm
addicted to fascination.

13:17.441 --> 13:22.362
Nothing can be
fascinating for too long.

13:22.364 --> 13:22.864
True.

13:29.020 --> 13:32.258
Have you ever been
addicted to a person?

13:32.260 --> 13:35.230
I don't think I have ever
felt addicted to a person.

13:42.021 --> 13:43.645
Do you want to find
a club to dance at?

13:47.600 --> 13:48.100
Sure.

15:19.531 --> 15:22.428
So how was your
date with that guy?

15:22.430 --> 15:23.560
What's his name?

15:23.562 --> 15:24.268
It wasn't a date.

15:24.270 --> 15:25.438
We were just hanging out.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.348
Oh, come on, I can
tell by your energy it

15:27.350 --> 15:30.308
was more than just hanging out.

15:30.310 --> 15:32.694
You know I never like
anyone romantically.

15:40.110 --> 15:42.138
Passage.

15:42.140 --> 15:45.086
What is this?

15:47.860 --> 15:48.668
Passage.

15:56.346 --> 15:58.468
Wondering if you noticed
the half moon with Jupiter

15:58.470 --> 16:02.038
by its left shoulder last night.

16:02.040 --> 16:05.538
I did see the moon
last night and today.

16:05.540 --> 16:07.398
Perfectly halved.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.960
But I didn't catch Jupiter
or the moon's shoulder.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.630
But I did notice your
left shoulder somehow.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.710
So you emailed that you had
some complications in your life.

16:42.350 --> 16:49.408
Well, I just felt like I should
tell you that I'm married.

16:49.410 --> 16:51.588
Separated.

16:51.590 --> 16:54.233
Oh, I thought you
were going to say

16:54.235 --> 16:55.608
something different
like you were

16:55.610 --> 16:57.260
addicted to coke or something.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.220
No.

17:06.138 --> 17:09.137
Let's play.

17:09.138 --> 17:10.502
No, I'm smoking.

17:10.503 --> 17:12.472
No.

17:12.473 --> 17:12.973
What?

17:24.839 --> 17:27.768
If you are, I am.

17:27.770 --> 17:28.369
No, you can't.

17:46.440 --> 17:49.076
You need to quit smoking.

17:49.078 --> 17:51.568
Fuck you.

17:51.570 --> 17:54.644
Fuck you.

17:54.646 --> 17:58.586
Give me my cigarette back.

17:58.588 --> 18:00.080
Oh shit!

19:01.834 --> 19:04.353
Thank you.

19:04.355 --> 19:04.980
You're welcome.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.903
Who's the guy you're seeing?

19:10.905 --> 19:13.278
What?

19:13.280 --> 19:15.288
What are you talking about?

19:15.290 --> 19:18.688
I saw you going to a club a
couple weeks ago with a guy.

19:18.690 --> 19:22.188
Oh, no, Ati, that's the
new intern at the gallery.

19:22.190 --> 19:23.098
He's from New York.

19:23.100 --> 19:24.948
Yasmine wanted me to
show him around town,

19:24.950 --> 19:26.484
make him feel comfortable.

19:33.260 --> 19:35.458
Seemed to be dancing
pretty close.

19:35.460 --> 19:36.258
I was dancing.

19:36.260 --> 19:37.528
I was having fun.

19:37.530 --> 19:40.908
I was helping him
feel comfortable.

19:40.910 --> 19:45.458
And what were you doing
walking by that club anyway?

19:45.460 --> 19:47.408
What's his name?

19:47.410 --> 19:48.458
His name?

19:48.460 --> 19:50.348
Michael.

19:50.350 --> 19:52.009
I was just walking.

19:52.011 --> 19:52.508
Really?

19:52.510 --> 19:53.008
Downtown?

19:53.010 --> 19:53.918
Mhm.

19:53.920 --> 19:54.468
At night?

19:54.470 --> 19:56.958
That's weird.

19:56.960 --> 20:00.278
I guess that it doesn't
seem like you would do that.

20:00.280 --> 20:02.298
It was just coincidental.

20:02.300 --> 20:06.308
Yeah, that's a
weird coincidence.

20:06.310 --> 20:09.858
If you say there's nothing going
on, then I have to believe you.

20:09.860 --> 20:10.360
OK.

20:27.700 --> 20:30.458
The reason I brought
down here was

20:30.460 --> 20:38.718
because I had to let you know
that you are safe with me,

20:38.720 --> 20:45.190
and that I have you, and
I will take care of you.

20:51.010 --> 20:52.367
Do you understand?

20:55.683 --> 20:56.183
Yes.

20:59.522 --> 21:00.270
Yes, what?

21:03.250 --> 21:05.986
Yes master.

21:05.988 --> 21:06.488
Good.

21:13.958 --> 21:14.954
Very good.

22:34.348 --> 22:35.326
How do you feel?

22:38.260 --> 22:40.089
Alive.

22:40.091 --> 22:40.590
Good.

26:45.908 --> 26:46.906
What's wrong?

26:50.770 --> 26:53.485
Do you really have
to ask me that?

26:53.487 --> 26:54.445
You know.

27:00.200 --> 27:04.135
then why don't you tell me

27:09.810 --> 27:13.678
I don't like it
that you can't stay.

27:13.680 --> 27:14.848
You always have to go.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.391
What would you like
me to do, Sylvia?

30:33.782 --> 30:37.588
I don't think I can
come down tomorrow.

30:37.590 --> 30:40.998
Kate found your tampon.

30:41.000 --> 30:43.168
She looked through
my trash downstairs.

30:47.574 --> 30:48.990
I'm not really in
a space to talk.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.060
I want see you so
much, but I can't.

31:17.852 --> 31:20.478
I'm dark, I know.

31:20.480 --> 31:23.258
I wish you would get home.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.365
I'm sort of confused.

31:39.610 --> 31:43.668
I really wish we could
talk in person right now.

31:43.670 --> 31:45.168
I feel like I don't
want to drag you

31:45.170 --> 31:47.648
into this anymore than I have.

31:47.650 --> 31:48.600
I'm so sorry, Louisa.

31:52.555 --> 31:53.055
What?

32:34.680 --> 32:38.090
Louisa, I want to
live with my kids.

32:51.956 --> 32:53.328
I'm sorry, Michael,
I'm not going

32:53.330 --> 32:55.188
to be able to hang out tonight.

32:55.190 --> 32:57.528
I have to work on some
paintings for an upcoming show,

32:57.530 --> 32:58.890
but we'll see each other soon.

33:51.180 --> 33:53.018
Ok make a wish.

33:53.020 --> 33:53.518
Ready?

33:53.520 --> 33:54.020
Yeah.

34:24.139 --> 34:28.078
Just don't get all
melodramatic in the screenplay.

34:28.080 --> 34:30.547
I know that your
connection to Luke

34:30.550 --> 34:34.226
felt really profound to
you, but it might not

34:34.228 --> 34:37.286
read that way to everybody.

34:37.289 --> 34:39.058
I hope we have an
earthquake, that way we

34:39.060 --> 34:40.678
can have an apocalyptic
ending where

34:40.679 --> 34:42.808
the only thing that
matters is true love.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.308
Then whoever's
playing me is going

34:44.310 --> 34:47.937
to have to be in that scene,
because what you had with him

34:47.938 --> 34:49.539
was definitely not love.

34:52.647 --> 34:54.230
Anyway, I don't want
to talk about it.

35:37.080 --> 35:37.580
Shit.

35:59.580 --> 36:00.578
Hi.

36:00.580 --> 36:01.078
Hey.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.080
Sorry I'm late.

36:06.080 --> 36:09.068
Either way it's a
very temporal state.

36:09.070 --> 36:12.779
I mean, nothing can be
fascinating for too long.

36:12.781 --> 36:13.280
It's true.

36:18.154 --> 36:19.820
Have you ever been
addicted to a person?

36:23.033 --> 36:23.532
Cut.

36:25.991 --> 36:26.488
That's good.

36:26.490 --> 36:27.398
Good?

36:27.400 --> 36:30.268
I can do it a little louder
or broader if you want,

36:30.270 --> 36:31.838
or I can just...

36:31.840 --> 36:33.718
Yeah, let's try some...

36:33.720 --> 36:35.068
a few different things.

36:35.070 --> 36:38.258
Maybe a little
bit more neurotic.

36:38.260 --> 36:41.178
None of them feel
right me, but I

36:41.180 --> 36:43.448
do feel like we found our lead.

36:43.450 --> 36:45.108
I knew it the first
time I saw her.

36:45.110 --> 36:49.268
Honestly, I'm not sold on
her as an actress either.

36:49.270 --> 36:52.638
Babe, I just don't feel like
I can feel her sexuality.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.779
I'm surprised you're
concerned about her sexuality.

36:54.781 --> 36:56.030
I feel like she has in spades.

38:29.910 --> 38:32.484
So you started dancing again.

38:32.486 --> 38:33.978
How is that?

38:33.980 --> 38:35.008
It's pretty great.

38:35.010 --> 38:36.068
It's fun.

38:36.070 --> 38:40.728
It's a distraction from
my class and the thesis.

38:40.730 --> 38:42.898
Maybe I should start dancing.

38:42.900 --> 38:44.868
Wait, what?

38:44.870 --> 38:47.448
You've always been so
against dancing, though.

38:47.450 --> 38:52.440
Not because of morality,
because of pride.

38:52.442 --> 38:53.898
I don't judge it,
I just don't want

38:53.900 --> 38:56.178
the stigma that comes with it.

38:56.180 --> 38:59.568
I have to fund the
film somehow, and I

38:59.570 --> 39:02.338
feel like I have to do something
extreme to get over Luke.

40:46.662 --> 40:47.618
Hey, how are you doing?

40:47.620 --> 40:48.168
Hi, good.

40:48.170 --> 40:48.668
How are you?

40:48.670 --> 40:49.708
Good, good.

40:49.710 --> 40:51.001
What can I get for you?

40:51.003 --> 40:52.498
I'm going to get a margarita.

40:52.500 --> 40:53.598
Margarita!

40:55.120 --> 40:57.720
Also, do you guys have a
bathroom here I can use?

40:57.722 --> 40:59.180
Yeah, it's right
through that door.

41:02.260 --> 41:03.750
Hey, by the way,
it's a strip club.

42:52.400 --> 42:54.818
All right, hold on, Juliet.

43:04.420 --> 43:12.428
Main character, love
skeptic, filmmaker.

43:12.430 --> 43:16.158
I want to show
their push and pull.

43:16.160 --> 43:17.555
How he was a sadistic priest.

43:50.580 --> 43:53.398
Hi, Anthony.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.481
I've got some great ideas
for the kickstarter.

43:58.070 --> 44:00.538
There's a lot of noise.

44:00.540 --> 44:02.998
Are you with people?

44:03.000 --> 44:03.523
OK.

44:03.525 --> 44:04.024
OK, bye.

44:17.886 --> 44:18.780
Hi, Ati.

44:21.450 --> 44:23.548
I'm feeling so overwhelmed.

44:23.550 --> 44:26.282
There's so much coming up
for me with the kickstarter.

44:29.060 --> 44:32.178
I feel like something's
going on with Anthony.

44:32.180 --> 44:33.489
I don't know.

44:33.491 --> 44:33.990
He's AWOL.

44:37.094 --> 44:39.411
Yeah, we can talk about
it more at Por Que No.

44:42.120 --> 44:45.728
OK, I'll be there in 30 minutes.

44:45.730 --> 44:46.339
OK.

44:46.341 --> 44:46.840
Bye.

44:59.320 --> 45:01.885
How are you?

45:01.887 --> 45:02.470
Where are you?

45:06.570 --> 45:09.660
I'm driving around in
Southeast Portland.

45:42.594 --> 45:45.270
Louisa, where are you?

45:48.650 --> 45:49.400
Call me back.

46:05.304 --> 46:07.290
Shit.

46:14.132 --> 46:15.590
I need to tell you
something later.

46:18.850 --> 46:19.350
OK.

46:45.730 --> 46:46.340
I'm so sorry.

47:04.415 --> 47:06.888
So I have something to tell you.

47:06.890 --> 47:10.428
I think you already
know this, though.

47:10.430 --> 47:14.208
But I feel like we should
finally say it out loud.

47:14.210 --> 47:20.630
So the script, the film,
it's about you, I mean, us.

47:23.240 --> 47:23.960
Oh my God.

47:27.450 --> 47:28.830
No, I didn't fucking know.

47:32.790 --> 47:38.968
All I've wanted this whole time
is you, as foolish as that is.

47:38.970 --> 47:41.338
You have your kids.

47:41.340 --> 47:43.008
My art is all I have.

48:02.780 --> 48:05.478
Really, Anthony?

48:05.480 --> 48:07.338
I'm working 24/7.

48:07.340 --> 48:10.448
I don't have time to talk
about how you want to fuck her.

48:10.450 --> 48:12.030
That's so unprofessional.

48:18.400 --> 48:20.750
You know you're lying,
it just doesn't fit.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.800
Have you been reading my emails?

48:30.480 --> 48:32.480
Why don't you tell me
where you were last night?

48:35.030 --> 48:35.960
You have been.

48:43.890 --> 48:45.140
I have to come up to Seattle.

49:28.070 --> 49:30.210
You want to know why I do
the things I do for you?

49:32.840 --> 49:33.720
Because I care.

49:37.830 --> 49:38.450
I love you.

49:42.010 --> 49:42.790
What's my name?

49:46.031 --> 49:48.930
Ati!

49:48.932 --> 49:51.460
I'm the one.

50:02.940 --> 50:06.988
You're casting an
actor to play me,

50:06.990 --> 50:11.058
and you were talking to me about
your process and everything

50:11.060 --> 50:12.215
and I had no clue, really.

50:48.659 --> 50:49.700
What's going on with you?

50:57.620 --> 50:59.736
I just want to feel you.

51:03.117 --> 51:05.049
I want to feel you deeper.

51:08.913 --> 51:12.318
Where are you?

51:12.320 --> 51:13.060
Where are you?

51:19.456 --> 51:20.932
I'll be right back.

51:24.890 --> 51:27.958
I can't stay the night.

51:27.960 --> 51:29.790
But please don't go yet.

52:07.950 --> 52:09.421
I have to tell you something.

52:16.097 --> 52:16.678
I'm an artist.

52:16.680 --> 52:18.088
And now you're a stripper.

52:18.090 --> 52:19.468
What else do I not know?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.035
I'm not a fucking stripper.

52:25.110 --> 52:27.048
You don't trust me.

52:27.050 --> 52:27.548
No.

52:27.550 --> 52:29.133
You don't even fucking
trust yourself.

52:36.374 --> 52:38.288
You have no idea of what
you're talking about.

52:38.290 --> 52:38.868
Yeah, I do.

52:38.870 --> 52:40.586
I really thought
we were different.

52:43.430 --> 52:46.753
I thought we were different.

52:46.755 --> 52:48.130
You know what, it
doesn't matter.

52:52.610 --> 52:53.110
Goodbye.

53:08.548 --> 53:09.542
I love you.

55:03.850 --> 55:07.267
I'm going to take you
somewhere special in honor

55:07.269 --> 55:07.935
of your success.

55:11.460 --> 55:16.123
But I need you to do
something for me, OK?

55:16.125 --> 55:16.940
Good girl.

55:19.860 --> 55:24.287
This weekend I'm going to
bring something special for you

55:24.289 --> 55:24.789
to wear.

58:16.782 --> 58:19.525
I feel like I can't
do this anymore.

58:23.420 --> 58:24.840
Every day my heart is breaking.

58:27.834 --> 58:28.832
I'm alone.

58:36.816 --> 58:37.814
Kneel down.

01:00:04.141 --> 01:00:06.636
I've never loved
anyone like this.

01:00:13.123 --> 01:00:16.738
I'll come back tomorrow
before I go to work.

01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:19.298
You're going to
wait here for me.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:19.800
OK?

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:38.734
I'll miss you tonight.

01:00:46.204 --> 01:00:47.698
I'll dream about you.

01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:12.740
That was good.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.188
I wanted to toast to our
successful kickstarter campaign

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:13.008
and the commencement of
our principal production,

01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:18.148
to all of you who have supported
this vision so much so far.

01:03:18.150 --> 01:03:20.654
To our imminent success.

01:03:20.656 --> 01:03:21.156
Salute.

01:04:01.575 --> 01:04:03.569
You can't do it like.

01:04:03.571 --> 01:04:06.064
You can't do it like.

01:04:06.066 --> 01:04:07.618
Cut.

01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:08.730
That was great.

01:04:08.732 --> 01:04:09.232
Perfect.

01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:24.668
Anthony, can I talk
to you for a minute?

01:04:24.670 --> 01:04:25.168
Yeah.

01:04:25.170 --> 01:04:27.148
Juliet, your expression
was enigmatic.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.688
Thank you.

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:28.581
Really good.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:31.688
Oh good, thanks.

01:04:31.690 --> 01:04:34.067
Do you mind not
doing that on set?

01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:35.608
I know we've worked
through my issues

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:37.702
with you dating our
actor, but I would really

01:04:37.704 --> 01:04:40.118
like it if you just kept that
behind closed doors for now.

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:40.619
OK?

01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:47.008
Everyone can take an
hour break for dinner,

01:04:47.010 --> 01:04:48.926
and then we're moving
to the waterfront scene.

01:04:52.142 --> 01:04:53.848
All right, let's get
a stand-in and check

01:04:53.850 --> 01:04:56.114
the audio and the light.

01:04:56.116 --> 01:04:57.998
Oh, shit.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:58.508
The wine.

01:04:58.510 --> 01:04:59.484
Where's the wine?

01:05:08.260 --> 01:05:10.798
Louisa, someone dropped
this off for you.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:12.138
I don't know who it was.

01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:13.428
What?

01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:15.542
I didn't tell anybody
to bring this.

01:05:25.470 --> 01:05:26.388
Which way did he go?

01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.928
Where is he?

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:27.680
He was over there.

01:05:59.805 --> 01:06:02.298
OK.

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:03.797
Let's get going.

01:06:16.300 --> 01:06:17.914
I don't normally smoke.

01:06:17.916 --> 01:06:19.988
But lately it's become
a bit of a thing for me,

01:06:19.990 --> 01:06:23.888
hence this weird thing,
which I'm sure is worse,

01:06:23.890 --> 01:06:27.768
nanoparticles and all.

01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:30.098
I have an addictive personality.

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:31.518
I think I do to.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.018
Really?

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.488
Yeah.

01:06:33.490 --> 01:06:34.748
What are you addicted to?

01:06:34.750 --> 01:06:37.448
Mostly sensation, but
primarily different

01:06:37.450 --> 01:06:40.478
than normal sensations.

01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:43.443
Slight alterations.

01:06:43.445 --> 01:06:44.070
What about you?

01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.758
Love, I suppose.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.758
Cut.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.258
Sorry.

01:06:50.260 --> 01:06:50.758
Was that me.

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.218
That was not you.

01:06:51.220 --> 01:06:51.718
OK.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.568
That was great.

01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:53.138
It's me.

01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:54.518
I'm sorry, everyone.

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:56.628
Just, Damien, can I just
see what's going on here?

01:06:56.630 --> 01:06:57.129
Yeah.

01:07:01.360 --> 01:07:02.228
Looks good.

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:07.828
Thanks, D. Julie,
how are you doing?

01:07:07.830 --> 01:07:08.657
I'm OK.

01:07:24.310 --> 01:07:26.456
Damien, that's so
unprofessional.

01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:34.598
Are you?

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.508
Yeah.

01:07:36.510 --> 01:07:38.908
Thanks, Maria.

01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:41.988
How are you doing in
front of the camera?

01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:43.658
Terrible, of course.

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:44.968
Has Ati come?

01:07:44.970 --> 01:07:45.468
No.

01:07:45.470 --> 01:07:46.408
Fuck.

01:07:46.410 --> 01:07:47.248
OK.

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:49.858
We have to call him.

01:07:49.860 --> 01:07:50.758
OK.

01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.100
So just tell me, yes
or no, are you coming?

01:08:06.490 --> 01:08:09.808
He looks like he's not coming.

01:08:09.810 --> 01:08:13.189
I don't know what to do, but
I can't worry about that right

01:08:13.191 --> 01:08:13.688
now.

01:08:13.690 --> 01:08:16.048
Well, I could pass as
a 50-something year

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.678
old Korean man.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:18.938
Oh God.

01:08:18.939 --> 01:08:22.376
OK, come watch me out there.

01:08:22.377 --> 01:08:23.839
All right, Quite on the set.

01:08:26.770 --> 01:08:27.828
104 Charlie.

01:08:27.830 --> 01:08:28.327
Take two.

01:08:28.328 --> 01:08:28.828
Mark.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:32.122
What about you?

01:08:32.124 --> 01:08:33.790
Well, I haven't tried
drugs or anything.

01:08:38.210 --> 01:08:39.154
Love, I suppose.

01:08:41.616 --> 01:08:42.948
I wonder what that means to you.

01:08:48.912 --> 01:08:50.578
Have you ever been
addicted to a person?

01:08:57.069 --> 01:09:02.805
Well, once.

01:09:07.921 --> 01:09:10.130
I think I'm still trying to
figure out what that was.

01:09:49.270 --> 01:09:52.658
Dreams are better than
memories, because memories,

01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:55.338
I will forget them all.

01:09:55.340 --> 01:10:00.948

01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:03.457
but at least I have evidence.
