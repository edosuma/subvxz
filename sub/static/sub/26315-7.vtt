WEBVTT

00:02.132 --> 00:04.482
So, I'm out sick one day,
and that's the day

00:04.526 --> 00:06.136
they decide to pick
study partners.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.225
Now I have my choice
between the weird dude

00:08.269 --> 00:09.400
who always wears a bow tie

00:09.444 --> 00:11.707
or the girl who writes
with a feather pen.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.187
Take bow tie guy.

00:13.230 --> 00:15.580
He's a smarty.How do you know?

00:15.624 --> 00:18.061
Oh, come on, when judging
a man's intelligence, it goes

00:18.105 --> 00:20.194
bow tie, straight tie,
no tie, bolo tie.

00:21.717 --> 00:23.240
Of course, if you're
looking for sex,

00:23.284 --> 00:25.286
it goes the other way.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.462
That's true.
My Victor used to wear

00:27.505 --> 00:29.333
a bolo tie on occasion.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.991
Did it get awkward
because he's dead

00:35.035 --> 00:37.211
or because I'm talking
about my sex life?

00:38.255 --> 00:39.213
Little bit of both.

00:39.256 --> 00:41.084
Geez, Tammy,

00:41.128 --> 00:42.868
you could just take
the lid off and dip 'em.

00:42.912 --> 00:46.133
Sorry. In prison, you only
get one crack at the shaker.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.960
I'm living the dream.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.964
Oh, before I forget, I'm
cleaning out my closet tomorrow.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.575
If anybody wants anything...I'm in.

00:53.618 --> 00:55.098
No bags, no jewelry.

00:55.142 --> 00:56.882
I'm out.

00:56.926 --> 00:58.319
What size shoe do you wear?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.886
The size you wore when
you were eight years old.

01:00.930 --> 01:03.889
Oh, you're a man's size ten?

01:03.933 --> 01:05.413
I'll come.Me too.

01:05.456 --> 01:07.632
Great. Party
in my closet.

01:07.676 --> 01:09.199
That used to mean
I was so drunk

01:09.243 --> 01:11.854
I couldn't find
my way out.

01:11.897 --> 01:13.769
You ladies want
some dessert?

01:13.812 --> 01:16.293
No, just the check.Here you go.

01:16.337 --> 01:18.817
Oh, are we in a hurry?
I was enjoying the company.

01:18.861 --> 01:21.168
Really? You wouldn't rather
get home to your loving hu...

01:21.211 --> 01:23.779
hu-hu-hu...
horde of cats?

01:23.822 --> 01:25.607
[mouthing]

01:25.650 --> 01:27.261
Nice save.

01:27.304 --> 01:29.828
I'm sorry.

01:29.872 --> 01:31.134
Are you doing okay?

01:31.178 --> 01:33.223
Okay.

01:33.267 --> 01:36.139
It's just been real lonely
since Victor passed.

01:38.663 --> 01:42.232
Well, I don't have
any plans tomorrow

01:42.276 --> 01:45.844
if you want to
come over and...

01:45.888 --> 01:48.020
hang out.

01:48.064 --> 01:50.153
That would be wonderful.

01:50.197 --> 01:52.286
[chuckles]

01:57.073 --> 01:59.075
â™ª

02:20.879 --> 02:23.534
Look who's still in bed
as the clock strikes noon.

02:23.578 --> 02:26.189
Shh. Desert Animal
Rescueis on.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.539
They're pulling a coyote
out of a septic tank.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.672
Poor fella doesn't know
they're trying to help.

02:33.849 --> 02:36.156
Oh, damn it.

02:36.199 --> 02:37.505
I'm not thrilled
you're in here either,

02:37.548 --> 02:39.942
but it is where we keep
the coffee.

02:39.985 --> 02:41.987
It's not about you.
I'm trying to fight with Adam,

02:42.031 --> 02:44.425
but auto correct keeps
making my texts nice.

02:44.468 --> 02:48.603
I meant to say "butt munch,"
not "butter munchkin."

02:48.646 --> 02:51.432
Aw. He's your little
butter munchkin.

02:51.475 --> 02:54.174
Who just canceled
our dinner plans

02:54.217 --> 02:56.219
so he could meet with
the barstool salesman.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.655
He's opening a bar.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.614
Drunks need something
to fall off of.

02:59.657 --> 03:02.530
I don't want to sound selfish,
but I liked it better

03:02.573 --> 03:04.227
when his life was empty
and he had nothing to do

03:04.271 --> 03:05.707
but pay attention to me.

03:05.750 --> 03:08.231
TAMMY:
Come on, swim to the harness.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
They're your friends.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.238
[whispers]:
What is the plan with her?There is no plan.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.500
So she's gonna
live here forever?

03:16.544 --> 03:18.676
I hope not, but maybe.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.505
You know she refers
to our couch as her room?

03:21.549 --> 03:24.116
I'm sorry, but I can't
just kick her out.

03:24.160 --> 03:26.728
I don't want you to.

03:26.771 --> 03:29.600
Actually, I do, but it makes me
feel bad about myself.

03:29.644 --> 03:32.124
TAMMY: Hey, Christy,
I'm super cozy out here.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.126
You mind grabbing me
some more Froot Loops?

03:34.170 --> 03:35.258
Coming.

03:35.302 --> 03:36.955
Figure it out,
butter munchkin.

03:38.305 --> 03:39.523
[phone chimes]

03:39.567 --> 03:41.438
"Who dis?"

03:41.482 --> 03:44.180
Not funny.

03:45.312 --> 03:48.097
When.
Thanks, Christy.

03:48.140 --> 03:49.359
My pleasure.

03:51.709 --> 03:54.364
Hey, can I tell you something?

03:54.408 --> 03:56.148
I am so grateful
to you and your mom

03:56.192 --> 03:57.541
for taking me in.

03:57.585 --> 03:59.369
I don't know where
I'd be without you.

03:59.413 --> 04:03.330
Of course.
Stay as long as you need.

04:03.373 --> 04:04.548
[knocking]

04:04.592 --> 04:06.246
So weak.

04:07.421 --> 04:10.206
Hey, Marjorie,
come on in.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.513
Marge!Hey, hello, ladies.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.341
Mom, your play
date is here.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.343
I've been really
looking forward to this.

04:16.386 --> 04:18.214
All right,
you kids have fun.

04:18.258 --> 04:21.086
No prank phone calls,
and don't use the oven.

04:21.130 --> 04:24.264
Well, look at you,
40 minutes early.

04:24.307 --> 04:26.962
Oh, sorry, just excited.

04:27.005 --> 04:30.313
I've had today circled on
my calendar since last night.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.098
So, what do you want to do?

04:33.142 --> 04:35.623
Well, I figured
I'd be here all day,

04:35.666 --> 04:36.972
so I brought a puzzle.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.190
Oh, my God, a puzzle?

04:38.234 --> 04:39.409
Oh, my God, all day?

04:42.456 --> 04:44.022
Thanks for helping me out.

04:44.066 --> 04:45.285
Happy to.

04:45.328 --> 04:46.677
In fact, I already
cleaned out my closet

04:46.721 --> 04:48.200
to make room for
all the stuff

04:48.244 --> 04:49.463
I'm gonna get
from your closet.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.250
And also, I'm your friend
and I love you.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.385
I should warn you:
my closet's a little messy.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.212
CHRISTY:
Oh, I'm sure it's no big...

05:00.256 --> 05:01.562
Holy balls.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.738
Did you fire
your housekeeper?

05:03.781 --> 05:06.784
Or is she buried
under all this stuff?

05:06.828 --> 05:08.525
I don't let Belinda
come in here anymore.

05:08.569 --> 05:11.311
Caught her wearing
one of my hats and imitating me.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.531
Okay, let's do this.

05:14.575 --> 05:17.099
Jill, go get us four trash bags
and we'll start sorting.

05:17.142 --> 05:18.448
I'm on it.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.232
Why four bags?

05:20.276 --> 05:23.410
Stuff to toss, stuff to donate.
Your haul, my haul.

05:23.453 --> 05:25.673
What do we do if we both
want the same thing?

05:25.716 --> 05:28.153
Don't test me, Wendy.
Don't test me.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.899
"Dogs Galore," huh?

05:34.943 --> 05:37.511
What happened, you couldn't
fine "Cats Galore"?

05:37.554 --> 05:40.209
I've already done
Cats Galore.

05:40.252 --> 05:41.906
and Cats Galore Two.

05:41.950 --> 05:45.606
Cats Aplenty
is on back-order till March.

05:45.649 --> 05:49.349
Hey, look, I put together
this little fella's face.

05:49.392 --> 05:53.396
Oh, that's great, Tammy,
but standard puzzling procedure

05:53.440 --> 05:55.529
dictates that we start
with the edges.

05:55.572 --> 05:57.487
It goes edges, then corners,

05:57.531 --> 06:00.751
then color clusters: E-C-C.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.320
Congratulations,
you just took an unfun thing

06:04.364 --> 06:05.669
and made it less fun.

06:05.713 --> 06:09.020
In prison, every puzzle
led to a fistfight.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.414
Then again, so did daylight.

06:11.458 --> 06:15.026
Well, worst prison riot
I was ever in

06:15.070 --> 06:17.028
was over a game of Scrabble.

06:17.072 --> 06:18.856
We were almost finished, and
then the new girl swallowed

06:18.900 --> 06:21.816
the W 'cause someone told her it
was laced with acid.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.471
I hate Scrabble.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.994
It's got spelling and math.

06:26.037 --> 06:28.866
It's just school in a box.

06:28.910 --> 06:31.434
No offense, Marjorie, but you
don't seem like the prison type.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.654
Thanks to 39 years of recovery.

06:33.697 --> 06:36.352
And these glasses on a chain.

06:38.267 --> 06:39.399
So, what-what were you in for?

06:39.442 --> 06:41.052
Bank robbery.

06:41.096 --> 06:43.925
Here's a corner.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.841
Wait, you robbed a bank?

06:46.884 --> 06:49.670
The money was for
a righteous political cause.

06:49.713 --> 06:53.630
And, uh, I really wanted
tickets to Steppenwolf.

06:53.674 --> 06:56.328
Man, that is so cool.
You had a reason.

06:56.372 --> 06:58.461
I robbed an Outback Steakhouse
'cause I was high

06:58.505 --> 07:00.681
and there was
an Outback Steakhouse.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.335
Ugh, I hate puzzles!

07:03.379 --> 07:05.207
They're so frustrating
and boring.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.948
Ooh, I got one.

07:09.733 --> 07:11.431
CHRISTY: Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

07:11.474 --> 07:14.564
I am so wearing this
to class Monday.

07:16.392 --> 07:18.350
Better to my reading
because I'm definitely

07:18.394 --> 07:21.571
getting called on.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.531
[laughs]
Oh, that looks so good on you.

07:24.574 --> 07:26.097
I'm gonna keep it.

07:27.882 --> 07:29.840
Got to stop trying stuff on.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.408
Did you change your mind
about this, too?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.018
I did not.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.630
Jill, is that a real fur?

07:36.673 --> 07:39.154
Sure is. And I never
got a chance to wear it.

07:39.197 --> 07:40.503
Couple of angry
animal people got me

07:40.547 --> 07:43.027
on the way out of the store.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.465
Good for them.

07:45.508 --> 07:48.206
You know what, I do want
to keep that jacket.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.078
Go limp.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.168
Fine, keep it.

07:53.211 --> 07:55.475
Thank you.

07:55.518 --> 07:58.173
Oh, here's something
I'm not gonna want back.

07:58.216 --> 08:00.567
Ooh, I like that.

08:00.610 --> 08:03.526
Oh, it still has
the price tag on it.

08:03.570 --> 08:07.312
Wow, this is, like,
110 hoodies.

08:07.356 --> 08:08.836
And a car.

08:08.879 --> 08:12.622
Yeah, I bought that the day
my divorce became final.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.406
Ugh, the day Baxter and I
got divorced,

08:14.450 --> 08:16.800
I treated myself
to a Shamrock Shake.

08:20.195 --> 08:22.023
You okay?Yeah, it's just hard

08:22.066 --> 08:23.546
to think about that time.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.461
Well, let's not, then.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.506
What's in here?

08:27.594 --> 08:30.205
That's my wedding dress.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.034
Zip it, zip it, zip it!

08:35.340 --> 08:38.561
Come on, guys,
it's a closet party.

08:38.605 --> 08:40.563
Shimmy, shimmy, shimmy.

08:41.782 --> 08:45.220
I'm sorry, you're right.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.184
Oh, my God.

08:53.228 --> 08:56.361
When did you cross a prairie
in a covered wagon?

08:56.405 --> 08:58.886
What were you thinking?

08:58.929 --> 09:00.714
I bought that
when I was pregnant.

09:02.585 --> 09:05.719
I was gonna wear it
to my baby shower.

09:05.762 --> 09:08.765
I must have sh-shoved
everything in that drawer

09:08.809 --> 09:10.550
after I had the miscarriage.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.901
Oh.

09:13.944 --> 09:15.946
Go limp.

09:24.520 --> 09:27.262
It's okay, let it out.[crying]

09:27.305 --> 09:29.699
[whispering]:
It's so soft.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.876
I know.

09:32.920 --> 09:35.618
Maybe you'd feel better
if we got back to

09:35.662 --> 09:36.750
to cleaning your closet.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.969
This isn't a closet.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.363
It's a museum
of all my failures.

09:41.406 --> 09:44.714
Or it's a museum
of the things that

09:44.758 --> 09:46.716
made you the person
you are today.

09:46.760 --> 09:50.198
A divorced, childless failure.

09:50.241 --> 09:52.722
I was going for
a strong, sober woman

09:52.766 --> 09:56.378
who has a chandelier
in her closet.

09:56.421 --> 09:58.423
It doesn't mean anything.

09:58.467 --> 10:01.426
Want me to go downstairs
and get you some water?

10:01.470 --> 10:05.039
You don't have to go anywhere.
Just open that cabinet.

10:10.174 --> 10:11.915
Ooh.

10:11.959 --> 10:15.353
A chandelier
and a refrigerator.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.791
If that doesn't say winner,
I don't know what does.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.185
You just have no idea
what it's like

10:21.229 --> 10:23.448
to still be such a train wreck.

10:23.492 --> 10:24.711
What are you talking about?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.756
My middle name
is train wreck.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.237
I'm in two 12-step programs

10:29.280 --> 10:33.633
and I get all my dental work
done in Mexico.

10:33.676 --> 10:35.635
But you never relapsed.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.333
You don't know how hard it is
to get sober again.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.336
I mean, that's why
I shop so much--

10:41.379 --> 10:44.382
to distract myself.

10:44.426 --> 10:47.037
Look--

10:47.081 --> 10:48.430
leather pants.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.867
I mean, who am I, Pat Benatar?

10:53.043 --> 10:54.828
I love her.

11:00.747 --> 11:03.532
If you've been this upset,
why haven't you shared about it?

11:03.575 --> 11:05.708
'Cause I'm embarrassed.

11:05.752 --> 11:09.320
You guys are all doing so well.

11:10.365 --> 11:12.497
All I've done is throw away

11:12.541 --> 11:13.934
three years of sobriety.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.415
But you're back,
and that's the important part.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.417
Big whoop.

11:19.461 --> 11:22.159
My life's a complete
waste of time.

11:22.203 --> 11:26.076
Okay, you know what?
Ting-a-ling-a-ling.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.339
What's that?

11:28.383 --> 11:32.082
That bell means it's time
to shut down the pity party.

11:32.126 --> 11:35.390
Ting-a-ling-a-ling.

11:36.739 --> 11:39.307
Are you trying
to tough love me?

11:39.350 --> 11:41.744
I sure as hell am.

11:41.788 --> 11:44.007
Oh, you're so cute.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.798
Damn it. This isn't a hat,
it's a puppy tongue.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.321
Well, I got a boatload
of tongues over here

11:53.364 --> 11:54.583
if anyone needs 'em.

11:54.626 --> 11:55.976
Seriously, you're
hoarding tongues?

11:56.019 --> 11:57.238
Yeah, what of it?

11:57.281 --> 12:00.371
Easy, easy.

12:00.415 --> 12:02.373
What do you say we take a break
and have some lunch?

12:02.417 --> 12:03.984
No. No food
till we're finished.

12:04.027 --> 12:06.290
Look at you--
couple hours,

12:06.334 --> 12:08.075
you're a full-on puzzle junkie.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.511
Yeah. That's how I roll.

12:09.554 --> 12:11.600
If it's fun,
I make it a problem.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.865
You know we're
all thinking it,

12:15.909 --> 12:17.562
but I'm gonna
say it out loud:

12:17.606 --> 12:20.174
I wish puzzle club
could be every day.

12:22.393 --> 12:23.830
We're not calling it
puzzle club.

12:23.873 --> 12:25.005
Yes we are.
Marjorie and I decided

12:25.048 --> 12:26.180
when you were in the bathroom.

12:27.398 --> 12:28.573
I'm making us buttons.

12:30.532 --> 12:31.663
Hey, does Adam like puzzles?

12:31.707 --> 12:33.535
I wouldn't mind
our club bending co-ed.

12:35.058 --> 12:37.408
Adam doesn't have time
for puzzles right now.

12:37.452 --> 12:39.541
Or me.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.456
Oh, boo-hoo.What?

12:41.499 --> 12:43.327
At least he's alive.

12:43.371 --> 12:45.547
Really? You're gonna
play the widow card?

12:45.590 --> 12:48.115
Well, I find
it wins most arguments.

12:48.158 --> 12:52.119
Especially now that my cancer
went into remission.

12:52.162 --> 12:53.337
So what are you saying,
I can't complain

12:53.381 --> 12:54.686
I never see him anymore?

12:54.730 --> 12:56.776
I'm just saying
have some perspective.

12:56.819 --> 12:58.560
Oh, sure, I'm good at that.

12:58.603 --> 13:00.605
Hey, how did you
and Victor meet?

13:00.649 --> 13:04.044
Well, he just evicted Bonnie
and Christy from their house,

13:04.087 --> 13:05.828
and we kind of hit it off.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.048
That's adorable.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.615
Yeah. We were living in a motel
known for its abundance of meth,

13:10.659 --> 13:12.139
but at least
Marjorie had someone

13:12.182 --> 13:13.444
to watch Blue Bloodswith.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.841
Anyway...

13:18.885 --> 13:20.843
it was such
a surprise for me.

13:20.887 --> 13:23.846
I got to have a last love. I'll
always be grateful for that.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.413
Why does he have to be
your last love?

13:25.456 --> 13:27.023
Tammy, I'm a cat lady

13:27.067 --> 13:28.982
who just founded a puzzle club.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.029
Co-founded.

13:35.553 --> 13:37.425
Anyway, the odds are against me.Well, you don't

13:37.468 --> 13:39.819
know that. Victor surprised you,
maybe someone else will.

13:39.862 --> 13:42.169
Yeah, Marjorie. Maybe you should
have some perspective.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.519
Okay, you guys, look, it's
getting a little heavy.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.042
Let's change
the subject.

13:46.086 --> 13:47.870
Now tell me about this cancer.

13:53.658 --> 13:57.706
Ms. Kendall, to women's shoes.

13:57.749 --> 13:59.664
[sighs]

13:59.708 --> 14:03.146
Well, I can see the floor again.
I guess that's progress.

14:03.190 --> 14:04.756
How about we all go out tonight

14:04.800 --> 14:06.541
so I can thank y'all
for helping?

14:06.584 --> 14:09.370
I have to work.Me, too.

14:09.413 --> 14:11.894
But it's Saturday night.
That seems unfair.

14:11.938 --> 14:13.896
I'm a nurse.I'm a waitress.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.985
People like to eat
on Saturday nights.

14:16.029 --> 14:19.597
And then have massive
heart attacks.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.512
You know, this might
surprise you guys,

14:21.556 --> 14:24.559
but I've never had a job.

14:24.602 --> 14:27.562
Really?No.

14:27.605 --> 14:29.651
Hand to God.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.480
Maybe you should
think about getting one.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.313
Why?

14:39.356 --> 14:43.012
Because you were crying earlier
that your life was meaningless,

14:43.056 --> 14:45.623
and maybe a job would
give it some purpose.

14:47.669 --> 14:50.759
Or, at the very least, give you
a boss you can bitch about.

14:50.802 --> 14:54.545
Ugh, I hate Teresa.

14:54.589 --> 14:56.112
But what would I do?

14:56.156 --> 14:57.809
Well, you love clothes.

14:57.853 --> 14:59.594
Maybe you could work
at a clothing store.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.903
Or open one.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.427
Hmm.
And wait on people like me?

15:06.470 --> 15:09.125
I'm a nightmare.
No, thank you.

15:09.169 --> 15:11.519
Well, what other job skills
do you have?

15:11.562 --> 15:13.913
I can ride horses,
play tennis and fence.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.698
Great, you could be
a camp counselor.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.528
Have you thought about
going back to school?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.878
No way. Christy makes that
look miserable.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.749
I'm not miserable.

15:24.793 --> 15:26.447
You complain about it
all the time.

15:26.490 --> 15:28.231
All the time.

15:28.275 --> 15:32.018
Don't test me, Wendy.
Don't test me.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.629
Jill's right.
You're so cute.

15:39.373 --> 15:42.071
Can I see the box?
I need to look at the picture.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.681
An advanced puzzler
would tell you

15:43.725 --> 15:45.466
it's cheating
to look at the picture.

15:45.509 --> 15:47.947
Well, I would tell that advanced
puzzler to bite my ass.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.513
Now give me the box.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.560
[gasps] Bam!

15:52.603 --> 15:54.475
Rainbow squeaky toy, done.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.957
Ooh, which means my rottweiler
fits right in there.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.654
Which connects to my pug tail.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.221
Way to go, Puss in Boots.

16:01.264 --> 16:03.049
Puss in Boots?Yeah. I'm trying out

16:03.092 --> 16:05.094
nicknames for you.
That's obviously not it.

16:06.922 --> 16:08.837
I didn't hate it.

16:10.404 --> 16:12.319
Here's a thought.

16:12.362 --> 16:15.061
What if puzzle club could be
every day for the two of you?

16:15.104 --> 16:17.367
What are you getting at?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.761
Well, you're all
by yourself now,

16:19.804 --> 16:21.937
and you could
use a room with a door.

16:23.721 --> 16:24.984
So I'm saying,

16:25.027 --> 16:28.291
you know...

16:28.335 --> 16:30.337
Oh, come on, people,
follow the breadcrumbs.

16:30.380 --> 16:32.078
You two should live together.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.123
Oh.Oh.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.432
I'm not gonna say
how I feel about it

16:38.475 --> 16:39.868
till you say
how you feel about it.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.351
I think that's a great idea.Me too!

16:46.396 --> 16:49.573
Just one thing.
How do you feel about cats?

16:49.617 --> 16:51.401
I always wanted one.Well, now you have eight.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.404
Actually, nine.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.406
A stray wandered in
the night Victor died.

16:56.450 --> 17:00.106
I'm not saying it's him,
but it's him.

17:01.672 --> 17:04.284
I have nine cats
and a puzzle club.

17:04.327 --> 17:06.112
My life is awesome!

17:11.943 --> 17:15.599
Don't worry, this isn't garbage.
We're just making a donation.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.385
Wow, did you do
a neighborhood clothing drive?

17:18.428 --> 17:22.519
Nope, just one woman's
obscenely large closet.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.521
There's four more bags
in the car.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.610
One of them's just sports bras.

17:26.654 --> 17:31.267
I shop to fill a hole,
but that's not your problem.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.530
This is all designer stuff.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.098
Yeah, but not from this year.
Is that still okay?

17:36.142 --> 17:38.274
Yeah, we can make that work.

17:38.318 --> 17:40.320
Most of the women who
come to our shelter

17:40.363 --> 17:41.973
show up with nothing.

17:42.017 --> 17:43.540
That's heartbreaking.

17:43.584 --> 17:45.281
Oh, but this is the kind
of stuff that will

17:45.325 --> 17:47.457
really help them
get back on their feet.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.850
They can wear it
to job interviews,

17:48.893 --> 17:52.897
or... if they win an Oscar.

17:52.941 --> 17:55.552
I have a bunch
of maternity clothes, too,

17:55.596 --> 17:57.119
if anyone here is pregnant.

17:57.163 --> 17:59.556
Oh, we've got pregnant.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.645
Thank you so much.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.257
I better get sorting.
This is gonna take a while.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.737
Okay, well,
it's nice meeting you.

18:06.781 --> 18:08.739
[quietly]: You have a lot
of free time. You could help.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.525
I have a lot of free time.
I could help.

18:11.568 --> 18:14.005
How about Monday through Friday,
9:00 to 5:00?

18:14.049 --> 18:15.355
Okay.Really?

18:15.398 --> 18:17.661
I was kidding,
but that would be amazing.

18:19.663 --> 18:23.014
Look at that.
I got a job. Ha, ha!

18:23.058 --> 18:24.625
Congratulations.Yay!

18:24.668 --> 18:26.148
Okay, I'm gonna go
get the rest of the bags.

18:26.192 --> 18:29.369
Does she understand this
is a volunteer position?

18:29.412 --> 18:30.979
She's got a chandelier
in her closet.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.807
She's gonna be fine.

18:39.901 --> 18:41.032
Bonnie, it doesn't go there.

18:41.076 --> 18:42.556
Yes, it does.What...

18:42.599 --> 18:45.036
Come on. If you bend the pieces,
I can't frame it.

18:45.080 --> 18:46.429
[gasps]
Ooh, can we put it in my room?

18:46.473 --> 18:47.778
I'm pretty sure the puzzle stays

18:47.822 --> 18:49.084
where the puzzle was completed.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.086
Oh, time-out.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.262
Potty break.[groans]

18:53.306 --> 18:56.309
You know, we could just
finish it while she's gone.

18:56.352 --> 18:57.745
She called a time-out.So?

18:57.788 --> 18:59.007
And just like that,

18:59.050 --> 19:00.313
puzzle club gets political.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.970
I think you're really gonna
like living with Marjorie.

19:06.014 --> 19:07.189
Oh, I think so, too.

19:07.233 --> 19:09.191
I want to say...

19:09.235 --> 19:11.062
what a pleasure it's been

19:11.106 --> 19:13.587
to be part of your...

19:13.630 --> 19:17.504
miraculous transformation,
and, um...

19:17.547 --> 19:19.984
I'm really gonna miss you.

19:20.028 --> 19:23.205
I'm only moving
a half mile away.

19:23.249 --> 19:26.861
[strains]:
Mm-hmm.

19:26.904 --> 19:29.342
CHRISTY:
Hey.

19:29.385 --> 19:30.691
Hey.

19:30.734 --> 19:32.127
Ooh. You guys
are doing a puzzle.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.911
It's called
"Dogs Galore."

19:33.955 --> 19:36.653
I see why.

19:36.697 --> 19:37.915
Ooh, I got one.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.221
Ah, puzzle club only.

19:39.265 --> 19:41.658
Puzzle club?

19:41.702 --> 19:43.225
Puzzle club.
We're getting buttons.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.445
Hey, Christy, I'm moving
in with Marjorie.

19:45.488 --> 19:49.100
Oh, okay.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.277
Are you gonna cry
like your mom did?

19:51.320 --> 19:54.193
I amhaving big feelings.

19:56.978 --> 19:58.284
[mouths]

20:00.199 --> 20:02.679
Oh, you are the finest person

20:02.723 --> 20:04.812
who has walked
the face of this Earth.

20:04.855 --> 20:06.814
Thank you.

20:06.857 --> 20:08.468
BONNIE:
Damn it, we're missing
the last piece!

20:08.511 --> 20:10.252
TAMMY:
Look on the floor!
It's got to be here somewhere.

20:10.296 --> 20:13.255
I knew they'd try
to finish without me.
