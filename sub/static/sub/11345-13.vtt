IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:03.237 --> 00:04.038
SEXUALLY-BASED OFFENSES

00:04.072 --> 00:06.707
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.042
IN NEW YORK CITY,

00:08.076 --> 00:09.143
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:09.177 --> 00:10.778
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.811 --> 00:12.446
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:12.480 --> 00:14.448
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:14.482 --> 00:17.118
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:19.387 --> 00:22.823
- [whispering] HEY! HARRY!

00:22.856 --> 00:24.825
- DWAYNE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:24.858 --> 00:28.062
- I GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.598
- WHAT IS IT?

00:30.631 --> 00:33.434
BINOCULARS?
[binoculars beep]

00:33.467 --> 00:36.604
- WITH A CAMERA.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.771
- TOTAL JACKPOT.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.507
[camera snapping pictures]

00:39.540 --> 00:41.842
I FOUND A HALF-NAKED BLOND LADY
AND THEY'RE DOING IT.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.145
- OH, LET ME SEE.
LET ME SEE, HARRY.

00:44.178 --> 00:46.114
HARRY, GET OFF.

00:46.147 --> 00:49.083
[camera snapping pictures]
WHAT'S HE DOING?

00:49.117 --> 00:51.085
I DON'T THINK
THEY'RE PLAYING AROUND.

00:51.119 --> 00:52.453
- GIVE ME A TURN, COME ON.
- WAIT. WAIT.

00:52.486 --> 00:54.522
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.258
- WHAT IS IT?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.826
- ANOTHER LADY JUST GOT HOME.

00:58.859 --> 01:01.762
[camera snapping pictures]

01:01.795 --> 01:04.298
HE KNOWS SHE'S THERE.

01:04.332 --> 01:06.834
OH, MY GOD.
WAIT, LADY...

01:06.867 --> 01:08.302
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- DON'T GO IN THERE.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.171
HE'S BEHIND THE SHELF.

01:10.204 --> 01:12.506
RUN, LADY, RUN!

01:12.540 --> 01:14.775
OH, MY GOD.
HE'S ATTACKING HER.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.745
HE'S GONNA KILL HER!
HARRY, CALL 911.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.148
HE'S STOMPING HER TO DEATH!

01:20.181 --> 01:21.882
[camera snapping pictures]

01:21.915 --> 01:25.153
- THE APARTMENT BELONGS
TO ANN JACKSON.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.720
SHE LIVES HERE
WITH DR. DEBBIE SHIELDS.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.322
- LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE
GIRLFRIENDS.

01:28.356 --> 01:29.823
- DEBBIE, THE BLOND,
WAS BEING RAPED

01:29.857 --> 01:32.726
WHEN ANN, HER DOMESTIC PARTNER,
CAME HOME.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.830
SO THE PERP
RAPED DEBBIE HERE.

01:36.864 --> 01:37.898
ANN WALKS IN

01:37.931 --> 01:39.267
AND HE ATTACKS HER THERE.

01:39.300 --> 01:40.534
BOTH OF THEM
ARE AT MERCY NOW.

01:40.568 --> 01:41.602
- WELL, PATROL CANVASSED.

01:41.635 --> 01:42.536
NO ONE SAW THE CREEP.

01:42.570 --> 01:44.205
- WOULD YOU SETTLE
FOR A COUPLE OF PEEPERS

01:44.238 --> 01:45.773
FROM ACROSS THE STREET?

01:45.806 --> 01:47.575
DWAYNE AND HARRY CALLED 911

01:47.608 --> 01:50.511
RIGHT AFTER THEY GOT DONE
PLAYING A LITTLE REAR WINDOW.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.845
- SO YOU'RE SPYING
ON YOUR NEIGHBORS?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.214
- THE CURTAINS
WERE WIDE OPEN.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.315
- AND HE TOOK IT
AS AN INVITATION

01:54.348 --> 01:55.149
TO TAKE SOME PICTURES.

01:55.183 --> 01:57.651
SHOW HIM WHAT YOU GOT,
SHUTTERBUG.

02:00.888 --> 02:03.624
- YOU PHOTOSHOPPED
THIS GUY'S FACE?

02:03.657 --> 02:05.559
- NO. NO. HE'S A TOTAL FREAK
OF NATURE.

02:05.593 --> 02:08.762
MAYBE HE'S A ZOMBIE.
- OR HE'S WEARING A MASK.

02:08.796 --> 02:12.500
- IF THAT'S A MASK, I'D HATE
TO SEE WHAT'S UNDERNEATH.

03:04.752 --> 03:05.719
- I'LL DO THE RAPE KIT
LATER.

03:05.753 --> 03:06.820
- IT MAY BE TOO LATE.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.656
- ANN HAS A MASSIVE BRAIN BLEED
THAT COULD KILL HER.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.923
NEUROSURGEONS ARE ABOUT
TO OPERATE.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.158
I'M GONNA SCRUB IN.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.494
- AND WASH OFF ANY EVIDENCE
THAT STILL MAY BE ON YOUR HANDS.

03:13.527 --> 03:14.495
- ANN NEEDS ME NOW.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.764
- PLEASE, DEBBIE,
GET US SOMETHING TO GO ON.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.233
HAS ANYONE
EVER THREATENED YOU?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.569
- I HAVE RECEIVE THREATS
BECAUSE OF MY WORK.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.371
- YOU'RE AN OB-GYN?

03:23.404 --> 03:24.838
- LOOK, SOME PEOPLE OBJECT
TO WHAT I DO

03:24.872 --> 03:26.407
AT THE TRI-STATE REPRODUCTIVE
INSTITUTE.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.576
EXCUSE ME.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.616
- OUR CLINIC HAS HELPED
HUNDREDS OF CHILDLESS COUPLES.

03:35.649 --> 03:38.552
- SOME PEOPLE STILL OBJECT
TO IN VITRO FERTILIZATION.

03:38.586 --> 03:41.689
- CATHOLIC CHURCH
CONDEMNS IVF AS A SIN.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.657
I'VE INVITED THE POPE
TO COME MEET OUR BABIES.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.626
BUT SO FAR, NO WORD.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.961
- DEBBIE SAYS
SHE WAS THREATENED.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.631
- YES, RECENTLY BECAUSE OF HER
CUTTING EDGE WORK

03:50.664 --> 03:52.433
WITH GENE-MANIPULATED
EMBRYOLOGY.

03:52.466 --> 03:54.402
- CONTROVERSIAL?
- NOT TO ME, IT ISN'T.

03:54.435 --> 03:58.972
YOU SEE, SOME WOMEN CARRY
MUTANT MITOCHONDRIAL GENES

03:59.006 --> 04:01.442
THAT CAN CAUSE TERRIBLE DISEASE
IN THEIR CHILDREN.

04:01.475 --> 04:03.977
DEBBIE WAS ABLE TO MAKE
DISEASE-FREE EMBRYOS

04:04.011 --> 04:06.947
BY COMBINING ONE FATHER'S SPERM
WITH TWO MOTHER'S EGGS.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.882
- SHE MADE A BABY
WITH THREE GENETIC PARENTS?

04:08.916 --> 04:10.384
- WELL, THE EMBRYOS DIDN'T GROW
TO TERM.

04:10.418 --> 04:12.320
BUT THINK
OF THE POSSIBILITIES.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.488
- YOU MIX THEM ALL TOGETHER,
YOU GET A DESIGNER BABY.

04:14.522 --> 04:16.890
- BUT SOME PEOPLE OBJECT
TO THAT.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.526
THIS LETTER ARRIVED
FOR DEBBIE

04:18.559 --> 04:20.394
RIGHT AFTER HER RESEARCH
WAS PUBLISHED.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.433
- "GOD HATES FRANKENBABIES.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.302
PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD BE
STOMPED OUT LIKE BUGS."

04:28.336 --> 04:29.503
- THEY SHOULD BE STOMPED OUT.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.672
- PROUD OF WHAT YOU WROTE,
HUH?

04:31.705 --> 04:35.676
- I SIGNED IT, DIDN'T I?
I'M DOING GOD'S WORK.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.311
- THAT INCLUDES
COMMITTING ASSAULT,

04:37.345 --> 04:40.414
CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE
OUTSIDE ABORTION CLINICS?

04:40.448 --> 04:42.450
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.618
DID SOMEONE EXTERMINATE
THE FRANKENBITCH?

04:44.652 --> 04:46.086
- WELL,
DON'T BURST INTO TEARS.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.322
- WHEN GOD MAKES YOU PREGNANT,
STAY PREGNANT.

04:48.356 --> 04:50.591
WHEN GOD MAKES YOU BARREN,
STAY BARREN.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.659
- - WHEN GOD GIVES YOU
A UTERUS,

04:51.692 --> 04:52.893
MAYBE WE'LL LISTEN
TO YOUR SERMON.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.362
- WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

04:54.395 --> 04:57.498
- IN QUEENS
FUMIGATING A NURSERY SCHOOL.

04:57.531 --> 05:01.001
ASK THOSE KIDS IF BEDBUGS
ARE GOD'S CREATURES.

05:01.034 --> 05:02.603
- THE BUG BOMBER'S ALIBI
CHECKS OUT.

05:02.636 --> 05:03.937
HE WAS IN QUEENS.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.406
THOUGH THE TEACHER SAYS
THAT THE KIDS

05:05.439 --> 05:06.540
ARE STILL GETTING CHEWED UP.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.609
- THEY GET BIT.
WE GOT NOTHING.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.611
- YOU GOT ANYTHING FOR US?

05:10.644 --> 05:13.414
- THE RAPIST IS LITERALLY
TURNING HIMSELF INTO A MONSTER.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.982
- SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO ASSAULT THEM?

05:15.015 --> 05:16.584
HE FEELS THE NEED
TO TERRORIZE THEM?

05:16.617 --> 05:17.885
- I THINK THE MASK
MAY HAVE RITUAL

05:17.918 --> 05:19.820
OR CEREMONIAL IMPORTANCE.

05:19.853 --> 05:22.490
- LIKE HE'S PLAYING A CHARACTER
IN A FOLKTALE?

05:22.523 --> 05:27.361
- WELL, EITHER WAY,
HE'S ONE SICK SON OF A BITCH.

05:27.395 --> 05:28.662
- NO WONDER DEBBIE
DIDN'T WANT TO TALK.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.031
- YEAH.

05:31.064 --> 05:34.835
STILL DOESN'T LOOK
LIKE SHE'S READY.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.372
- HOW'S ANN?
- THEY'RE STILL OPERATING.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.841
- UH, THIS IS DETECTIVE STABLER.
- HI, DEBBIE.

05:40.874 --> 05:41.909
- HI.

05:41.942 --> 05:43.143
- THE KIDS WHO CALLED 911,

05:43.176 --> 05:44.945
THEY ALSO TOOK A PHOTO.

05:44.978 --> 05:46.113
WOULD YOU HAVE A LOOK?

05:46.146 --> 05:47.981
- YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.619
- WE CAN'T MAKE OUT
WHAT THE MASK IS SUPPOSED TO BE.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.153
- IT WAS HORRIBLE.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.123
I JUST CLOSED MY EYES.
WHY DID HE ATTACK ME?

05:56.156 --> 05:57.658
WHY DID HE HURT ANN?

05:57.691 --> 06:01.161
- ANN JACKSON? ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT ANN JACKSON?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.563
- YES.
- WHERE IS SHE?

06:02.596 --> 06:03.831
CAN I SEE HER?
- EXCUSE ME.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.133
YOU ARE?
- I'M CAP JACKSON.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.136
ANN'S FATHER.
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY THE POLICE.

06:09.169 --> 06:12.406
AND YOU MUST BE HER SURGEON.
HOW IS SHE?

06:12.440 --> 06:14.041
I'M AN MD.
YOU CAN GIVE ME THE DETAILS.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.709
- YOU TWO HAVEN'T MET?

06:15.743 --> 06:19.079
- UH, DR. JACKSON,
I'M DEBBIE SHIELDS.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.415
- YOU'RE ANN'S PARTNER.

06:21.449 --> 06:24.518
OH. I'M SORRY TO MEET YOU
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.420
- YOU'RE ESTRANGED
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.756
- UH, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M KEPT AT ARM'S LENGTH.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.458
- WHY IS THAT?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.659
- I DON'T THINK
MY FAMILY BUSINESS

06:31.692 --> 06:32.960
IS YOUR CONCERN.

06:32.993 --> 06:34.728
- WELL, ACTUALLY, EVERYTHING
IS OUR CONCERN.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.530
WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY DEBBIE AND ANN

06:36.564 --> 06:37.631
WERE ATTACKED LAST NIGHT.

06:37.665 --> 06:41.168
- AND I NEED TO KNOW
WHETHER MY DAUGHTER WILL LIVE.

06:41.201 --> 06:43.637
DID SHE SUFFER BRAIN TRAUMA?

06:43.671 --> 06:45.906
- BLUNT FORCE.
INTERNAL BLEEDING.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.208
- OH.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.645
WELL, IF THERE HAS TO BE
A MEDICAL DECISION--

06:51.679 --> 06:55.516
GOD FORBID,
BUT IT'S YOURS TO MAKE.

06:55.549 --> 07:00.521
- THANK YOU.

07:00.554 --> 07:03.524
- SHE GOT THROUGH THE SURGERY.
SHE'LL BE IN THE ICU.

07:03.557 --> 07:08.128
- SHE KEPT SCREAMING
AND I COULDN'T HELP.

07:08.161 --> 07:10.898
- YOU WERE TIED UP, DEBBIE.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.200
THE BEST WAY TO HELP
IS TO TELL US EVERYTHING.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.807
- UM, I CAME HOME.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.109
AND I-I OPENED THE DOOR.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.512
AND HE--HE PUSHED ME
INTO THE APARTMENT.

07:24.545 --> 07:26.079
- HE WAS WAITING FOR YOU
IN THE HALLWAY.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.581
- YES.

07:27.615 --> 07:31.485
HE CAME UP FROM BEHIND
AND CHOKED ME.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.253
I-I GUESS I PASSED OUT

07:33.286 --> 07:35.723
BECAUSE WHEN I CAME TO,

07:35.756 --> 07:37.825
I WAS TIED TO THE BED
AND GAGGED

07:37.858 --> 07:41.629
WITH THAT--THAT MASK
STARING AT ME.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.065
- DID HE SAY ANYTHING?

07:45.098 --> 07:49.670
- JUST THAT HE WOULD CURE ME
OF FALMOUTH.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.972
- HE WOULD CURE YOU
OF A FOUL MOUTH?

07:52.005 --> 07:56.276
- NO. CURE ME OF FALMOUTH.

07:56.309 --> 08:01.815
WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
- ARE YOU OKAY, DR. JACKSON?

08:01.849 --> 08:04.251
YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH.

08:04.284 --> 08:07.955
I THINK
I'LL GET SOME WATER.

08:14.928 --> 08:18.031
- WHO'S THAT?
- ANN'S FATHER.

08:18.065 --> 08:20.768
- HE'S GONNA WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT THIS.

08:20.801 --> 08:22.302
- LOOKS LIKE THE MASK
THE RAPIST WORE.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.904
- I RAN A CODIS SEARCH.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.206
IT'S A POLICE SKETCH
FROM RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.340
BACK IN 2006,

08:27.374 --> 08:31.979
A PERP WEARING THAT MASK
RAPED FOUR WOMEN IN ONE WEEK.

08:32.012 --> 08:33.814
- YOU THINK THAT'S THE SAME MAN
THAT'S RAPED DEBBIE

08:33.847 --> 08:36.283
AND ATTACKED MY DAUGHTER?

08:36.316 --> 08:41.088
- SAME ONE WHO WANTED
TO CURE DEBBIE OF FALMOUTH.

08:41.121 --> 08:43.657
THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU?

08:43.691 --> 08:47.160
- IT MEANS HE...

08:47.194 --> 08:49.963
RAPED THE WRONG WOMAN.

08:49.997 --> 08:53.166
- OKAY. SO YOU'RE SAYING
ANN WAS THE TARGET, NOT DEBBIE.

08:53.200 --> 08:57.938
WHY?
- I CAN'T SAY.

08:57.971 --> 09:02.242
I'M A PSYCHIATRIST.
IT WOULD
VIOLATEPRIVILEGEPRIVILEDGE.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.112
- DOCTOR,
YOU KNOW WHO DID THIS? MM?

09:05.145 --> 09:09.850
DO YOU KNOW WHO BEAT
YOUR DAUGHTER NEARLY TO DEATH?

09:09.883 --> 09:13.120
- THE CONFIDENTIAL BOND
BETWEEN PATIENT AND PHYSICIAN

09:13.153 --> 09:14.822
IS SACRED.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.825
- DOCTOR, WHAT IS SACRED
RIGHT HERE

09:17.858 --> 09:20.293
IS THE BOND BETWEEN A FATHER
AND HIS DAUGHTER.

09:20.327 --> 09:24.264
- YES!

09:24.297 --> 09:28.602
BUT I CAN'T TALK
ABOUT MY PATIENTS.

09:28.636 --> 09:29.737
- YOU'RE NOT
ONE OF THOSE DOCS

09:29.770 --> 09:33.240
WHO THINKS HE CAN CURE RAPISTS,
ARE YOU?

09:33.273 --> 09:36.343
- I SPECIALIZE
IN TREATING SEX ADDICTS.

09:44.084 --> 09:46.053
- DR. JACKSON HAS NOTHING
TO SAY.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.154
- WELL, I DO.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.057
OUR DETECTIVES DID A LITTLE
DIGGING ON YOUR CLIENT.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.159
FALMOUTH IS THE CAPE COD TOWN
WHERE DR. JACKSON'S FAMILY

09:52.192 --> 09:53.894
SPENT THEIR SUMMERS.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.797
THE INFERENCE THAT ANN
WAS THE RAPIST TARGET IS CLEAR.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.931
- WHAT IS NOT CLEAR

09:57.965 --> 10:00.734
IS WHICH ONE OF YOUR SEX ADDICT
PATIENTS IS OUR PERP.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.170
- IS MOCKERY YOUR ONLY MODE
OF COMMUNICATION, DETECTIVE?

10:03.203 --> 10:04.838
- NO. I CAN GIVE IT
TO YOU STRAIGHT.

10:04.872 --> 10:07.975
ALCOHOL, COCAINE, HEROIN,
THOSE ARE ADDICTIONS.

10:08.008 --> 10:08.976
RAPE IS NOT.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.879
- BRAIN IMAGING STUDIES
HAVE CONSTANTLY PROVED

10:11.912 --> 10:14.314
THAT SEXUAL COMPULSION
IS AS HARD TO CONTROL

10:14.347 --> 10:16.650
AS GAMBLING.

10:16.684 --> 10:18.919
- YOU WANT BRAIN IMAGES?
THERE YOU GO.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.756
TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.
- [mutters]

10:22.790 --> 10:24.758
- SO HOW DO YOU THINK
YOUR DAUGHTER IS GOING TO FEEL

10:24.792 --> 10:26.927
WHEN SHE FINDS OUT YOU PROTECTED
HER ATTACKER?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.729
SHE GONNA WAKE UP AND SAY
"THANK YOU, DADDY?"

10:28.762 --> 10:31.999
- DON'T YOU ACCUSE ME
OF NOT CARING ABOUT ANN.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.736
JUST...

10:35.769 --> 10:39.006
LISTEN, EVERY DAY,
I TREAT PEOPLE

10:39.039 --> 10:42.943
WHO ARE DISTURBED
TO THE VERY CORE OF THEIR SOULS.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.679
MOST OF THEM WERE ABUSED
AS CHILDREN.

10:45.713 --> 10:49.717
NOW, YOU CALL THEM SICKOS
AND SEND THEM TO PRISON.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.452
BUT MY JOB IS TO LISTEN TO THEM
AND HELP THEM GET BETTER.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.188
- PEOPLE LIKE THAT
DO NOT GET BETTER.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.057
- IN PRISON, CERTAINLY.

10:57.090 --> 11:01.929
MY PROGRAM, SOME DO.
IF THEY CAN TRUST ME.

11:01.962 --> 11:04.397
- GOOD. AT LEAST NOW I KNOW
WHERE TO LOOK.

11:04.431 --> 11:08.068
- WAIT. MY CLIENT'S SILENCE
IN NO WAY CONFIRMS

11:08.101 --> 11:11.038
THAT HE'S PROTECTING
A CURRENT PATIENT.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.775
DR. JACKSON HAS SEEN
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN 15 YEARS.

11:14.808 --> 11:17.444
- AND BEFORE THAT,
HE WAS A PATIENT HIMSELF.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.947
- EROS RUN AMOK.

11:19.980 --> 11:23.216
AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY
OF A SEX ADDICT.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.052
- I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

11:25.085 --> 11:27.020
MY WHOLE LIFE IS LAID BARE
IN THAT BOOK.

11:27.054 --> 11:29.422
- GEORGE HUANG.
I'VE LONG ADMIRED YOUR WORK.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.725
- OH.
AND I READ YOUR EDITORIAL

11:31.759 --> 11:34.127
IN THE AMERICAN JOURNAL
OF PSYCHIATRY

11:34.161 --> 11:35.963
WHERE YOU ARGUED
THAT SEX ADDICTION

11:35.996 --> 11:38.065
SHOULD BE ADDED
TO THE DSM-FIVE.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.067
- SHRINKS WANT
TO CALL SEX ADDICTION

11:40.100 --> 11:43.003
AN ILLNESS LIKE DEPRESSION
OR SCHIZOPHRENIA?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.137
- IT'S A REAL DISEASE.

11:44.171 --> 11:45.739
BUT IT'S GONNA
GET RECOGNIZED NOW

11:45.773 --> 11:47.507
THANKS TO DR. JACKSON'S
EFFORTS.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.476
- I HATE TO SKIP OUT
ON THE LITTLE STROKE-FEST.

11:49.509 --> 11:51.444
BUT I HAVE A RAPIST TO CATCH.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.412
- ELLIOT,
IF YOU COULD HOLD UP,

11:52.445 --> 11:54.848
I WAS HOPING WE COULD INTERVIEW
DR. JACKSON.

11:54.882 --> 11:57.484
- HE CAN'T TALK.
- ABOUT THE RAPIST.

11:57.517 --> 12:01.488
BUT HE CAN TALK
ABOUT THE VICTIM, HIS DAUGHTER.

12:01.521 --> 12:03.456
- DAUGHTERS ARE SUPPOSED
TO IDOLIZE THEIR FATHERS.

12:03.490 --> 12:08.395
AND AT TIMES,
I WAS WORTHY OF THAT LOVE.

12:08.428 --> 12:10.831
BUT THEN I WOULD GO OFF
ON THESE DRUNKEN SEXUAL BINGES

12:10.864 --> 12:13.100
FOR DAYS, WEEKS.

12:13.133 --> 12:15.435
I'D PANIC. I'D LITERALLY FEEL
THAT I WOULD DIE

12:15.468 --> 12:17.470
IF I DIDN'T HAVE SEX.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.306
- SYMPTOMS WE NOW KNOW
ARE CLASSIC SEX ADDICTION.

12:19.339 --> 12:20.774
- ABSOLUTELY.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.843
- "I SEDUCED A LIBRARIAN
WITH PROMISES

12:22.876 --> 12:24.477
I'D LEAVE MY WIFE."

12:24.511 --> 12:26.814
- I'M TOLD I WAS CHARMING.

12:26.847 --> 12:28.816
- "NEXT WAS A SUPERMARKET,
CHECKOUT GIRL

12:28.849 --> 12:30.517
"THE CLEANING WOMAN
AT MY COUNTRY CLUB,

12:30.550 --> 12:33.386
THEN A 60-YEAR-OLD WAITRESS
IN A DINER TOILET."

12:33.420 --> 12:36.189
- AND THOSE ARE JUST
THE ONES I CAN REMEMBER.

12:36.223 --> 12:38.458
I WAS CO-ADDICTED TO ALCOHOL
SO I CAN ONLY RECALL

12:38.491 --> 12:42.562
HALF OF WHAT I DID
AND WHO I HURT.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.564
- YOU KNOW YOU HURT
YOUR WIFE, ANN'S MOM.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.034
- YEAH.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.969
I KEPT PROMISING TO CHANGE.

12:49.002 --> 12:53.841
AND SHE KEPT BELIEVING ME
UNTIL...

12:53.874 --> 12:55.242
UNTIL SHE COULD NO LONGER
DO SO.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.979
AND THEN SHE DROVE UP
TO THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE

12:59.012 --> 13:01.815
AND...

13:01.849 --> 13:02.883
JUMPED.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.084
- NO WONDER YOU WANT
SEX ADDICTION

13:04.117 --> 13:05.485
TO BE A DISEASE.

13:05.518 --> 13:07.420
LET'S YOU OFF THE HOOK
FOR BEING A LOUSY HUSBAND.

13:07.454 --> 13:10.190
- I WAS BEYOND LOUSY,
DETECTIVE.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.060
I WAS MORALLY REPREHENSIBLE.

13:13.093 --> 13:18.198
AND I HOPE YOU NEVER HAVE
TO KNOW WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.034
- ELLIOT, DR. JACKSON'S THERAPY,
LIKE MOST 12-STEPS,

13:21.068 --> 13:22.569
REQUIRES PATIENTS
TO TAKE ACCOUNTABILITY

13:22.602 --> 13:24.037
AND MAKE AMENDS.

13:24.071 --> 13:25.372
- WELL, THE AMENDS YOU MADE

13:25.405 --> 13:27.274
DON'T SEEM
TO HAVE IMPRESSED ANN.

13:27.307 --> 13:29.042
HOW LONG HAS SHE KEPT YOU
AT ARM'S LENGTH?

13:29.076 --> 13:31.578
- 20 YEARS.

13:31.611 --> 13:34.147
BEFORE THAT,
WE WERE LIKE PEAS IN A POD.

13:34.181 --> 13:35.448
- IN YOUR BOOK,
YOU DATE YOUR ESTRANGEMENT

13:35.482 --> 13:40.453
TO THE SUMMER YOUR DAUGHTER
TURNED 16.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.456
- WELL, YEAH,
SHE WAS DISCOVERING

13:43.490 --> 13:45.492
HER SEXUALITY.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.194
WE KNEW SHE WAS GAY.

13:47.227 --> 13:49.096
HER MOTHER AND I WERE FINE
WITH THAT.

13:49.129 --> 13:51.098
- SO WHY DID SHE STOP SPEAKING
TO YOU

13:51.131 --> 13:56.269
THAT SUMMER AT FALMOUTH?

13:56.303 --> 13:57.404
- IT'S NOT PRIVILEGED,
DOCTOR.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.239
ANSWER THE QUESTION.

13:59.272 --> 14:03.443
- UH...IS THIS REALLY HELPING
YOUR INVESTIGATION?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.278
I GET THE FEELING
YOU'RE JUST PRODDING

14:05.312 --> 14:06.947
INTO MY MOST PAINFUL MEMORIES.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.516
AND IF YOU DON'T MIND,
I'D RATHER BE AT HER BEDSIDE.

14:12.285 --> 14:16.189
- WE HIT A NERVE.

14:16.223 --> 14:18.091
- DR. JACKSON.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.459
- I TOLD YOU THERE'S NO POINT
IN THIS.

14:19.492 --> 14:21.194
- SOMEONE NEEDS TO SPEAK
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.596
- WE'RE ASKING ABOUT FALMOUTH
BECAUSE THE RAPIST MENTIONED IT.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.099
- I CAN'T SAY
WHAT IS IN HIS HEAD.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.500
- WELL, I THINK I CAN.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.270
THIS IS A BOOK OF HINDU GODS
AND GODDESSES.

14:30.303 --> 14:33.373
THIS IS KAMADEVA,
GOD OF EROTIC LOVE.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.507
ONE OF KAMADEVA'S POWERS

14:34.541 --> 14:36.376
IS SPIRITUAL REDEMPTION
THROUGH SEX.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.178
- SO HE'S TRYING
TO REDEEM THESE WOMEN?

14:38.211 --> 14:40.580
- HE SAID HE WANTED
TO CURE ANN OF FALMOUTH.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.382
- CURE HER OF WHAT, DOC?

14:46.553 --> 14:49.022
CURE HER OF WHAT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

14:49.056 --> 14:50.657
WHAT HAPPENED IN FALMOUTH?
- PLEASE STOP.

14:50.690 --> 14:52.459
- YOU WERE SEXUALLY
OUT OF CONTROL.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.661
- DID YOU RAPE YOUR DAUGHTER?

14:54.694 --> 14:57.230
DID YOU RAPE YOUR DAUGHTER
BACK IN FALMOUTH?

14:57.264 --> 14:59.466
DID YOU RAPE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER?
- DID YOU RAPE HER?

14:59.499 --> 15:02.102
- I CAN'T REMEMBER!

15:03.403 --> 15:08.541
BUT...I THINK I...

15:08.575 --> 15:10.610
I THINK I DID.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.684
OH, GOD. I THINK I DID.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.526
OH.

15:26.559 --> 15:28.595
- ANN DOESN'T TALK MUCH
ABOUT HER FATHER

15:28.628 --> 15:29.529
OR HER CHILDHOOD.

15:29.562 --> 15:31.664
- IS THERE ANYONE
WHO COULD FILL US IN?

15:31.698 --> 15:35.735
- UM, SHE HAS A CHILDHOOD FRIEND
NAMED LINDA.

15:35.768 --> 15:37.537
- OKAY.

15:37.570 --> 15:39.572
- I'M SORRY.
I DON'T KNOW HER LAST NAME.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.141
- [groans]

15:41.174 --> 15:42.575
- ANNIE.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.244
ANNIE.

15:44.277 --> 15:45.678
- [whimpers]
- DON'T TRY AND TALK.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.580
OKAY, SWEETIE?
JUST REST.

15:47.614 --> 15:49.649
OH, I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.751
- WHAT HAPPENED?

15:51.784 --> 15:54.587
- ANN, I'M DETECTIVE BENSON.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.556
YOU WERE ATTACKED.

15:56.589 --> 15:59.226
ACTUALLY, YOU BOTH WERE.

15:59.259 --> 16:00.627
- IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

16:00.660 --> 16:02.629
- NOW, THE PERPETRATOR
MENTIONED FALMOUTH,

16:02.662 --> 16:05.665
A PLACE WHERE YOU SPENT
YOUR SUMMERS.

16:05.698 --> 16:07.100
- DID SOMETHING BAD
HAPPEN THERE?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.535
[monitor beeping rapidly]

16:08.568 --> 16:10.237
ANNIE? ANNIE?

16:10.270 --> 16:11.471
SHE'S SEIZING!

16:11.504 --> 16:12.672
ANNIE?
ANNIE, COME ON.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.108
STAY WITH ME.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.709
- OKAY, LET'S GIVE HER
FOUR MILLIGRAMS

16:16.743 --> 16:18.645
OF ATIVAN AND PREP
TO INTUBATE!

16:18.678 --> 16:22.782
[electronic beeping]

16:22.815 --> 16:25.285
- ANN JUST TOOK
A TURN FOR THE WORSE.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.719
- [sighs]

16:26.753 --> 16:28.555
TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURIES
CAN BE TRICKY.

16:28.588 --> 16:30.557
IT MIGHT BE WEEKS BEFORE
WE GET A PROGNOSIS.

16:30.590 --> 16:31.491
- YEAH.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.660
WE'VE GOT THE NAME
OF A CHILDHOOD FRIEND

16:33.693 --> 16:36.329
WHO KNEW ANN IN FALMOUTH.

16:36.363 --> 16:39.299
I'M GONNA HAVE FIN
TRACK HER DOWN.

16:39.332 --> 16:42.602
SO, DOC, EARLIER TODAY...

16:42.635 --> 16:45.505
WITH JACKSON...

16:45.538 --> 16:47.640
YOU WERE JUST FLATTERING HIM
TO GET HIM TO TALK, WEREN'T YOU?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.742
- SEX ADDICTION
IS REAL, ELLIOT.

16:49.776 --> 16:51.811
CAP JACKSON IS A PIONEER.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.147
- WE ALWAYS SAY THE VICTIMS
AREN'T TO BLAME.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.815
NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME RAPISTS
AREN'T TO BLAME EITHER?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.085
- MOST SEX ADDICTS
ARE NOT RAPISTS,

16:58.118 --> 17:00.053
BUT SOME RAPISTS
MIGHT BE SEX ADDICTS

17:00.087 --> 17:03.456
ACTING OUT ON COMPULSIONS
THEY CAN'T CONTROL.

17:03.490 --> 17:06.093
- EVERY DEFENSE ATTORNEY
WE FACE IS GONNA BE QUOTING YOU.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.560
- ALCOHOLICS WHO DRIVE
DRUNK GO TO JAIL.

17:07.594 --> 17:08.728
SO SHOULD SEX ADDICTS
WHO RAPE.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.230
- AND YOU'LL TESTIFY
TO THAT?

17:10.263 --> 17:11.664
- FOR THE PROSECUTION.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.734
WHICH MAY HAPPEN SOON,
BECAUSE A PATTERN

17:14.767 --> 17:16.536
IS STARTING TO EMERGE.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.539
I SENT THE RICHMOND SKETCH
TO SVUs NATIONWIDE.

17:19.572 --> 17:22.475
MORE VICTIMS HAVE
STEPPED FORWARD

17:22.509 --> 17:24.177
IDENTIFYING THE GOD OF LOVE
AS THEIR ATTACKER.

17:24.211 --> 17:26.179
IT SEEMS HE RAPES
THREE OR FOUR WOMEN

17:26.213 --> 17:27.614
IN ONE WEEK
AND THEN HE'S GONE.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.517
- RICHMOND, PHILADELPHIA,
NEW YORK, UTICA?

17:30.550 --> 17:33.520
- ALL CITIES WITH
SEX ADDICTION REHAB CENTERS.

17:33.553 --> 17:37.124
- SO OUR PERP CHECKS IN,
GOES INTO GROUP THERAPY

17:37.157 --> 17:40.160
AND LISTENS TO ADDICTS TALK
ABOUT THE WOMEN THEY VICTIMIZE.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.630
- AND THEN HE REDEEMS
THEM BY RAPING THEM AGAIN.

17:43.663 --> 17:45.132
- BUT FOR A GUY WHO'S OUT
TO SAVE WOMEN,

17:45.165 --> 17:46.433
HE SURE BEAT THE HELL
OUT OF ANN.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.567
- HE'S A NARCISSIST.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.502
- WELL, YEAH.
HE THINKS HE'S A GOD.

17:49.536 --> 17:51.471
- NARCISSISTS ARE PRONE
TO SUDDEN BURSTS OF VIOLENCE

17:51.504 --> 17:54.441
WHEN THINGS DON'T GO
ACCORDING TO THEIR PLAN.

17:54.474 --> 17:55.542
- WELL, THE PATIENT RECORDS
AT THESE REHABS

17:55.575 --> 17:56.609
WILL TELL US WHO WAS THERE

17:56.643 --> 17:58.545
AND WHICH ONE'S OUR NARCISSIST.

17:58.578 --> 17:59.746
- BUT WE'LL NEVER GET THEM
BECAUSE OF PRIVILEGE.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.615
- I'M GONNA STAKE OUT
JACKSON'S CENTER

18:02.649 --> 18:04.617
AND TAIL ANY ADDICT
WHO WALKS OUT OF THERE,

18:04.651 --> 18:06.486
'CAUSE WE KNOW HE'S GONNA
STRIKE SOON.

18:06.519 --> 18:09.856
- HE JUST DID.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.624
- I WAS ON MY WAY TO WORK
WHEN THIS FREAK

18:11.658 --> 18:14.394
COMES OUT OF NOWHERE AND PUSHES
ME INTO THE BASEMENT.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.628
- WHERE DO YOU WORK, HOLLY?

18:15.662 --> 18:17.597
- AT DOUBLE-D LIGHT.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.831
I'M A STRIPPER, OKAY?

18:18.865 --> 18:20.433
- IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT YOU DO.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.569
IT'S NOT AN INVITATION
TO BE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.737
- HE THREW ME DOWN,
TIED MY HANDS,

18:24.771 --> 18:26.439
AND RAPED ME.

18:26.473 --> 18:27.807
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

18:27.840 --> 18:30.843
- HE WAS WEARING
AN AWFUL MASK.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.550
THAT'S HIM.

18:37.584 --> 18:40.487
- HOLLY...
- CRAGEN.

18:40.520 --> 18:45.292
- HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BEFORE?

18:45.325 --> 18:46.893
- MY GOD.

18:46.926 --> 18:49.496
YES.

18:49.529 --> 18:51.731
A PROFESSOR IN COLLEGE
SAID HE'D FAIL ME

18:51.764 --> 18:54.367
IF I DIDN'T HAVE SEX
WITH HIM.

18:54.401 --> 18:58.671
TODAY, THE GUY KEPT SAYING
I'M AN A-PLUS.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.708
UNTIL HE SCREAMED
BLOODY MURDER.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.813
- YOU STABBED HIM?

19:06.846 --> 19:07.880
- I COULD ONLY
GET HIS FOREARM

19:07.914 --> 19:09.649
WITH MY HANDS TIED.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.618
WISH I'D SLIT HIS THROAT.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.420
- WELL, YOU MAY HAVE JUST
SOLVED YOUR CASE.

19:13.453 --> 19:15.522
WE MATCH THE BLOOD,
WE GOT HIM.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.689
IN THE MEANTIME,
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU

19:16.723 --> 19:17.790
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

19:17.824 --> 19:19.526
GREAT JOB.
- THANKS.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.429
CHECK THIS IN.
- THAT WAS LIV.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.764
DOCS HAD TO PUT ANN
INTO A MEDICALLY INDUCED COMA.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.699
- HOW BAD?

19:26.733 --> 19:27.867
- CAP'S THERE.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.770
SAID HE'S NOT LEAVING
HER BEDSIDE.

19:33.873 --> 19:35.442
- KEEP ME OFF THE GRID
FOR A WHILE.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.344
- OKAY.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.682
- DR. JACKSON HAD
A FAMILY EMERGENCY.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.553
ASKED US TO START WITHOUT HIM.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.622
SO WE'VE GOT LOTS TO DO.

19:49.656 --> 19:54.827
FIRST...
WE HAVE A NEW FRIEND.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.731
- MY NAME IS ELLIOT
AND I'M A SEX ADDICT.

20:04.371 --> 20:07.807
- I'M JUST GONNA COME
RIGHT OUT AND SAY IT.

20:07.840 --> 20:12.845
I LOVE SCREWING
16-YEAR-OLD GIRLS.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.516
STARTED WITH PORN.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.519
BUT THEN I-I GRADUATED
TO THE REAL THING.

20:19.552 --> 20:23.756
BY LAST FALL, I WAS NAILING
FIVE OR SIX A WEEK.

20:23.790 --> 20:28.295
- ELLIOT, HOW DOES CLAY
MAKE YOU FEEL?

20:28.328 --> 20:29.696
- TO EACH HIS OWN.

20:29.729 --> 20:32.532
- SORRY, ELLIOT,
WE HAVE A MODESTY CODE HERE.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.568
LONG SLEEVES,
LONG PANTS ALL TIMES.

20:38.771 --> 20:39.806
- WHAT HE'S DOING IS ILLEGAL

20:39.839 --> 20:43.042
AND YOU'RE BUSTING ME
FOR ROLLING UP MY SLEEVES?

20:43.075 --> 20:46.579
- I ALWAYS TEACH MY PATIENTS,
"NEVER GIVE UP."

20:49.482 --> 20:52.519
NO MATTER HOW ROUGH LIFE
TREATS YOU.

20:52.552 --> 20:54.020
- WELL, THE SURGEON SAID ANNA
HAD A GOOD CHANCE

20:54.053 --> 20:55.955
OF PULLING THROUGH.

20:55.988 --> 21:00.360
- SWELLING LIKE THAT
LEAVES PERMANENT DAMAGE.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.529
- I'LL GIVE YOU A MOMENT ALONE.

21:02.562 --> 21:04.964
- NO.
I'M SORRY.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.935
IT'S JUST MY FEAR.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.972
- WELL, I'M AFRAID TOO.

21:13.005 --> 21:14.941
THE RAPIST STRUCK AGAIN.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.042
- OH, GOD.

21:16.075 --> 21:17.710
- HIS 14TH VICTIM.

21:17.744 --> 21:21.681
- [sighs]
SAME MOTIVE?

21:21.714 --> 21:23.616
REDEEMING A WOMAN
WHO'S BEEN ABUSED?

21:23.650 --> 21:26.753
- SHE WAS FORCED TO HAVE SEX
BY HER COLLEGE PROFESSOR,

21:26.786 --> 21:30.757
WHO MUST HAVE MENTIONED IT
IN YOUR REHAB.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.959
- I CAN'T IDENTIFY MY PATIENTS.

21:32.992 --> 21:36.363
- THE RAPIST IS USING YOU, DOC.

21:36.396 --> 21:39.999
USING YOU TO FIND OTHER VICTIMS
JUST LIKE HE USED YOU

21:40.032 --> 21:41.768
TO FIND ANN.

21:41.801 --> 21:46.939
RIGHT?

21:46.973 --> 21:47.874
- [sniffling]
YEAH.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.677
I TALKED TO MY GROUP
ABOUT IT LAST WEEK.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.546
- YOU TOLD US THAT YOU DIDN'T
REMEMBER ASSAULTING HER.

21:53.580 --> 21:56.949
- I BLOCKED IT.

21:59.486 --> 22:02.789
I BLOCKED THAT NIGHT OUT
FOR 20 YEARS.

22:05.992 --> 22:11.431
OF ALL THE THINGS I DID...

22:11.464 --> 22:15.034
THAT WAS TOO TERRIBLE TO FACE.

22:15.067 --> 22:17.370
BUT THEN...

22:17.404 --> 22:19.572
A MONTH OR SO AGO,
IT STARTED COMING BACK.

22:19.606 --> 22:22.074
JUST HAZY IMAGES.
- DESCRIBE THEM.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.948
- I'M SWIMMING.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.554
ANN WAS LYING ON THE DOCK.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.589
HER LEGS...

22:36.623 --> 22:41.494
JUST HANGING IN THE WATER AND...

22:41.528 --> 22:42.662
I PULLED MYSELF UP.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.698
SHE WAS LYING THERE...

22:45.732 --> 22:48.601
NAKED.

22:48.635 --> 22:52.705
SHE LOOKED AT ME.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.907
I--

22:54.941 --> 22:58.778
I JUST HAD TO HAVE HER.

22:58.811 --> 23:03.049
- IF YOU TRIED TO RAPE ANN...

23:03.082 --> 23:06.419
YOU PROBABLY SUCCEEDED.

23:06.453 --> 23:12.058
- AND THE THING
THAT KILLS ME...

23:12.091 --> 23:15.962
IS THAT I WAS NEVER
ABLE TO SAY, "SORRY."

23:15.995 --> 23:18.097
- SO WOULDN'T IT BE A START
TO HELP US SEND THE ANIMAL

23:18.130 --> 23:19.899
WHO DID THIS TO PRISON?

23:19.932 --> 23:21.601
- NO.
NO, THAT'S TOO EASY.

23:21.634 --> 23:25.905
IT'S TOO EASY TO SAY
HE'S AN ANIMAL AND CAGE HIM.

23:25.938 --> 23:30.943
OF ALL THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED
FROM MY PATIENTS...

23:30.977 --> 23:32.144
IS IT THAT WHATEVER
THEY'VE DONE,

23:32.178 --> 23:34.747
THEY ARE STILL HUMAN BEINGS...

23:34.781 --> 23:38.050
- I TOLD YOU I TRADED GRADES
FOR SEX WITH MY STUDENTS,

23:38.084 --> 23:40.520
HOW I BETRAYED THAT TRUST.

23:40.553 --> 23:44.991
THEY FIRED ME FINALLY,
BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.926
- AND THEY ARE SUFFERING
DEEPLY INSIDE.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.996
- I SLEPT WITH SEVEN
GUYS A WEEK.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.899
SOMETIMES SEVEN AT ONCE.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.001
I PEGGED MY SELF-WORTH TO SEX.

23:55.034 --> 23:57.470
- NO ONE IS BEYOND REDEMPTION.

23:57.504 --> 24:00.673
- I MADE MY WIFE
GO SWINGING WITH ME.

24:00.707 --> 24:02.742
AND, WELL, YOU KNOW,
SHE HATED IT.

24:02.775 --> 24:05.044
SO SHE LEFT ME.

24:05.077 --> 24:08.481
AND NOW I'VE LOST THE ONLY WOMAN
I'VE EVER LOVED.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.650
- ASK YOURSELF, DETECTIVE.

24:10.683 --> 24:13.953
CAN YOU REALLY SAY THAT SOME
PEOPLE AREN'T WORTH SAVING?

24:13.986 --> 24:20.059
- YEAH, I CAN.

24:20.092 --> 24:23.730
- PICK A CHORE, ELLIOT.

24:23.763 --> 24:25.898
WE ALL PITCH IN.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.934
- UH, HOW ABOUT BROOM DUTY?

24:27.967 --> 24:28.901
- YEAH.

24:28.935 --> 24:32.739
COURTNEY?

24:32.772 --> 24:36.075
UM, COURTNEY HERE
WILL BE YOUR BIG SIB

24:36.108 --> 24:37.777
TILL YOU GET YOUR SPONSOR.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.911
- HEY.
- HEY.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.947
- WOULD YOU TELL ELLIOT
WHY I CHOSE YOU?

24:40.980 --> 24:43.883
- BECAUSE ELLIOT
IS THE KIND OF GUY

24:43.916 --> 24:45.785
I'D BE BANGING WITHIN TEN
MINUTES OF MEETING HIM

24:45.818 --> 24:48.688
BEFORE I GOT CLEAN.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.657
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN NOW?

24:50.690 --> 24:51.958
- NEW LIFE.
NEW STRENGTH.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.627
I GOT IT COVERED, BRETT.

24:54.661 --> 24:55.895
WELCOME TO THE HOUSE, ELLIOT.

24:55.928 --> 24:59.599
- THANK YOU.
IT'S NICE MEETING YOU, COURTNEY.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.572
- ARE YOU A COP?

25:05.605 --> 25:08.107
- EXCUSE ME?

25:08.140 --> 25:09.809
- I'VE SCREWED, LIKE,
WHOLE PRECINCTS.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.545
COPS CAN BE SEX ADDICTS.
IT'S OKAY.

25:12.579 --> 25:14.581
- [chuckles]

25:14.614 --> 25:16.115
SORRY.
I'M AN ACCOUNTANT.

25:16.148 --> 25:17.684
- OH.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.218
YOU COME OFF DIFFERENTLY.

25:19.251 --> 25:20.920
- OKAY, GUYS.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.555
BEDTIME.

25:22.589 --> 25:25.224
GOOD NIGHT.

25:25.257 --> 25:29.128
- GOOD NIGHT.

25:29.161 --> 25:31.964
- OH, HEY, ELLIOT.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.933
HOW'S DAY ONE
OF YOUR NEW LIFE?

25:33.966 --> 25:36.969
- INTERESTING.
THAT'S FOR SURE.

25:37.003 --> 25:38.871
- OH, UM, BY THE WAY,
YOU, UM--

25:38.905 --> 25:43.843
YOU CAN'T--
CAN'T WEAR THAT TOO SLEEP.

25:43.876 --> 25:45.645
- MODESTY RULE?
EVEN FOR BED?

25:45.678 --> 25:49.081
- ESPECIALLY FOR BED.
[chuckles]

25:52.084 --> 25:53.085
HERE.
STANDARD ISSUE.

25:53.119 --> 25:56.889
- THANKS.
HOW'D YOU GET THE CUT?

25:56.923 --> 26:00.960
- WELL, HOW'D I GET
ANY OF 'EM?

26:00.993 --> 26:04.797
ACTUALLY, IT'S PART
OF MY ADDICTION.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.667
I USED TO HIRE PROSTITUTES
TO CUT ME.

26:07.700 --> 26:10.837
THIS ONE'S ACTUALLY
ALL HEALED UP.

26:10.870 --> 26:14.674
- JUST KEEP IT BANDAGED
TO REMIND ME.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.643
- SO STABLER'S UNDERCOVER
IN JACKSON'S CLINIC?

26:16.676 --> 26:18.310
- HE'S WORKING AS FAST
AS HE CAN WHILE JACKSON'S

26:18.344 --> 26:20.112
AT ANN'S BEDSIDE.

26:20.146 --> 26:21.280
- FIND ANYONE
AT THE OTHER REHABS

26:21.313 --> 26:22.949
WHO COULD BE OUR PERP?

26:22.982 --> 26:24.851
- WE LOOKED INTO EMPLOYMENT
RECORDS AT UTICA,

26:24.884 --> 26:26.318
PHILLY, RICHMOND.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.020
SHRINKS, JANITORS, VENDORS.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.155
WE CAME UP EMPTY.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.991
- SO HE'S DEFINITELY A PATIENT,
PROTECTED BY PRIVILEGE.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.160
- ELLIOT'S OUR BEST BET
TO FIND THIS GUY.

26:34.193 --> 26:37.096
SPEAKING OF WHICH,
HE SHOULD BE CALLING ANY MINUTE.

26:37.129 --> 26:38.898
- ARE PHONES ALLOWED IN REHAB?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.133
- NO, THE PATIENTS WERE CAUGHT
SECRETLY SEXTING EACH OTHER.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.135
ELLIOT SNUCK HIS IN.

26:43.169 --> 26:44.971
- I DON'T WANT TO KNOW HOW.

26:45.004 --> 26:48.107
- ELLIOT, HOW'S IT GOING?

26:48.140 --> 26:50.342
- SLOWER THAN I THOUGHT.

26:50.376 --> 26:53.079
GOT MYSELF ON BROOM DUTY SO
I CAN POKE AROUND A LITTLE BIT.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.281
- SEE ANYONE
WITH A CUT FOREARM?

26:55.314 --> 26:56.816
- NO, NOT YET,
BUT THE NEXT STOP

26:56.849 --> 26:58.050
IS THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

26:58.084 --> 27:00.086
MAYBE SOMEONE WASHED HIS SHIRT
TRYING TO GET THE BLOOD OUT.

27:00.119 --> 27:01.654
- WHAT DOES YOUR GUT SAY?

27:01.688 --> 27:03.823
- OH, YOU KNOW,
WHERE DO I START?

27:03.856 --> 27:07.059
WE GOT A GUY NAMED CLAY,
WHO ENJOYS RAPING 16--

27:09.829 --> 27:11.664
- HAVE YOU BEEN A NAUGHTY BOY,
ELLIOT?

27:11.698 --> 27:12.965
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

27:12.999 --> 27:14.667
- GOOD MORNING.

27:14.701 --> 27:16.235
WHERE'S DR. JACKSON?

27:16.268 --> 27:18.037
- OH, YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

27:18.070 --> 27:19.706
CAP LOOKED EXHAUSTED
AND SO I TOLD HIM

27:19.739 --> 27:21.007
TO GO GET SOME SLEEP.

27:21.040 --> 27:22.208
- HE WENT HOME?

27:22.241 --> 27:24.677
'CAUSE I NEEDED
TO ASK HIM A QUESTION.

27:24.711 --> 27:25.978
- UH, HE WENT TO HIS CLINIC.

27:26.012 --> 27:27.714
HE SAID SEX ADDICTS
ARE A DELICATE BUNCH

27:27.747 --> 27:29.048
AND HE NEEDED TO CHECK IN.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.417
- GREAT.
THANKS.

27:31.450 --> 27:33.953
- YOU WERE ON THE PHONE.

27:33.986 --> 27:36.122
- NO, I WASN'T.
PHONES AREN'T ALLOWED.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.024
[cell phone vibrates]

27:38.057 --> 27:40.392
- I KNEW IT.

27:40.426 --> 27:45.798
OH, THOSE ARE COP REFLEXES.

27:45.832 --> 27:47.967
DID YOU THINK I WAS GRABBING
FOR YOUR GUN?

27:48.000 --> 27:49.969
LET ME GO OR I'LL SCREAM.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.038
- OKAY, RELAX.

27:56.743 --> 27:58.711
- OLIVIA.

27:58.745 --> 28:01.948
SHE YOUR GIRLFRIEND?

28:01.981 --> 28:03.950
- WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

28:03.983 --> 28:05.351
- THE THREE OF US
COULD HAVE SOME FUN.

28:05.384 --> 28:06.886
- NO, I NEED THAT BACK.

28:06.919 --> 28:07.954
COURTNEY.
- YEAH?

28:07.987 --> 28:09.455
- DON'T DO THAT.

28:09.488 --> 28:10.723
COURTNEY, DON'T DO THAT.

28:10.757 --> 28:13.826
- COME AND GET IT.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.497
- COURTNEY, DON'T DO THAT.

28:18.530 --> 28:20.132
PUT YOUR SHIRT BACK ON.

28:20.166 --> 28:23.369
- DOES OLIVIA PUT OUT, HONEY?

28:23.402 --> 28:25.037
DOES SHE SATISFY YOU?

28:25.071 --> 28:26.105
- DON'T.
DON'T.

28:26.138 --> 28:27.173
THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU.

28:27.206 --> 28:28.741
DON'T DO THIS.

28:28.775 --> 28:30.810
- BUT IT'S SO GOOD FOR YOU.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.445
- STOP.

28:33.479 --> 28:35.114
COURTNEY, THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THIS.

28:35.147 --> 28:36.816
- YOU GAY OR SOMETHING?

28:36.849 --> 28:37.984
- COURTNEY, LISTEN TO ME.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.518
MY DAUGHTER HAD TROUBLE
WITH DRUGS.

28:39.551 --> 28:41.053
SHE WAS PROMISCUOUS,
BUT SHE'S CLEAN.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.955
YOU'RE CLEAN.

28:42.989 --> 28:44.891
YOU'RE CLEAN.

28:44.924 --> 28:46.225
- YOU'RE A WALKING DOUCHEBAG.

28:46.258 --> 28:48.127
WON'T SCREW A PERFECTLY
GOOD PIECE OF TAIL.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.096
- JUST GIVE ME MY PHONE.

28:50.129 --> 28:51.998
- SOMEONE'S COMING.
FOLD SOMETHING.

28:52.031 --> 28:53.065
- GIVE ME THE PHONE, PLEASE.

28:53.099 --> 28:56.468
- NO!

28:56.502 --> 29:00.072
[door opens]

29:00.106 --> 29:01.107
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

29:01.140 --> 29:02.975
- LEAVING.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.043
- I'M DOING MY LAUNDRY.

29:04.076 --> 29:07.113
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:07.146 --> 29:10.149
- I'M JUST LOOKING FOR A SHIRT.

29:10.182 --> 29:12.218
GROUP'S MEETING EARLY TODAY.

29:12.251 --> 29:16.522
STARTS NOW.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.757
[door closes]

29:24.096 --> 29:26.565
- HEY, WHAT KIND OF SHIRT
WERE YOU LOOKING FOR?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.067
MAYBE I SAW IT.

29:28.100 --> 29:30.502
- LAUNDRY, MY ASS.

29:30.536 --> 29:32.571
YOU WERE GONNA
DO GANG-BANG GIRL.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.341
HER MOUTH WILL TAKE YOU
TO NIRVANA, MAN.

29:35.374 --> 29:36.976
SO I'M TOLD.

29:37.009 --> 29:39.045
- NIRVANA, HUH?

29:39.078 --> 29:41.447
HUH.
- GOOD MORNING.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.482
[class responds with greetings]

29:55.327 --> 29:58.030
- DR. JACKSON,
MY NAME IS ELLIOT,

29:58.064 --> 30:03.002
AND YOUR BOOK...
CHANGED MY LIFE.

30:03.035 --> 30:05.337
YOUR COURAGE...

30:05.371 --> 30:10.076
YOUR DO-THE-RIGHT-THING
MORAL CODE.

30:10.109 --> 30:14.280
YOU ARE THE REASON
WHY I'M HERE.

30:18.017 --> 30:20.419
- WELCOME, ELLIOT.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.454
[applause]

30:35.034 --> 30:36.335
- THANK YOU,
DR. KINCAID.

30:36.368 --> 30:38.370
- ELLIOT?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.944
HOW DARE YOU COME HERE
UNDER FALSE PRETENSES.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.545
- HOW DARE YOU PROTECT
A SERIAL RAPIST.

30:46.578 --> 30:49.315
- YOU ARE JEOPARDIZING EVERY--
- THANKS, DOC.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.050
- EVERYTHING I DO
TO HELP THESE PATIENTS.

30:51.083 --> 30:52.251
- YEAH.
REALLY?

30:52.284 --> 30:54.520
LIKE CLAY GIBSON?

30:54.553 --> 30:56.422
I MEAN, HE IS THE GOD-OF-LOVE
RAPIST, ISN'T HE?

30:56.455 --> 30:59.025
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HIM.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.427
- WELL, IS THAT THE ONLY GROUP
THAT YOU MENTIONED FALMOUTH TO?

31:01.460 --> 31:03.362
IS IT?

31:03.395 --> 31:04.496
SO YOU CALL ANOTHER MEETING

31:04.530 --> 31:06.632
AND YOU GET WHOEVER IT IS

31:06.665 --> 31:09.368
TO ADMIT TO WHAT HE'S DONE.

31:09.401 --> 31:12.104
- THERE'S NOTHING
I WOULD LIKE MORE

31:12.138 --> 31:13.372
FOR HIS OWN REDEMPTION,

31:13.405 --> 31:15.074
BUT NOT WITH YOU HERE.

31:15.107 --> 31:16.442
- YOU DON'T WANT REDEMPTION
FOR HIM.

31:16.475 --> 31:18.477
YOU WANT IT FOR YOURSELF.

31:18.510 --> 31:21.413
IN THE MEANTIME,
MORE WOMEN GET RAPED.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.383
NOW, MAYBE YOU CAN
LET THAT HAPPEN,

31:24.416 --> 31:29.956
BUT I CAN'T.

31:29.989 --> 31:33.325
CLAY GIBSON, 35, TWO MISDEMEANOR
ASSAULTS, BAR FIGHTS.

31:33.359 --> 31:35.261
HIS DNA'S NOT ON FILE,
BUT TEN-TO-ONE

31:35.294 --> 31:38.164
IT MATCHES THE BLOOD
ON HOLLY'S KNIFE.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.966
- SO THIS GUY WAS RAPING
16-YEAR-OLDS

31:39.999 --> 31:41.567
AND HE'S NOWHERE ON OUR RADAR?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.669
- MAKES YOU WONDER
HOW MANY MORE ARE OUT THERE.

31:43.702 --> 31:45.037
- WELL, I JUST SPENT
A LOVELY EVENING

31:45.071 --> 31:46.305
WITH ABOUT A DOZEN OF THEM.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.140
THIS HAS GOT TO BE OUR GUY.

31:48.174 --> 31:49.541
HE USED THE WORD "NIRVANA."

31:49.575 --> 31:52.444
YOU KNOW, THE REALM
OF THE INDIAN GODS.

31:52.478 --> 31:55.147
- BUT IF WE'RE WRONG,
ANOTHER WOMAN GETS RAPED

31:55.181 --> 31:57.716
AND THE REAL PERP SLIPS TOWN.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.418
DO BACKGROUND ON EVERY PATIENT.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.553
- I DON'T HAVE
THEIR LAST NAMES.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.256
BUT HE DOES.

32:04.290 --> 32:06.492
- ELLIOT--
EXCUSE ME.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.995
YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:09.028 --> 32:10.262
BUT YOU SEE,
I COULDN'T CONDEMN HIM

32:10.296 --> 32:12.999
WITHOUT CONDEMNING MYSELF.

32:13.032 --> 32:16.268
AND EVERYTHING I'VE DONE
HAS BEEN AN ATTEMPT

32:16.302 --> 32:20.739
TO RUN AWAY FROM MY OWN CRIME.

32:20.772 --> 32:22.441
- TIME TO STOP RUNNING.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.476
- YEAH.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.416
- DR. JACKSON.

32:30.449 --> 32:33.485
BEEN A LONG TIME.

32:33.519 --> 32:38.257
- YOU'RE...ANN'S OLD FRIEND?

32:38.290 --> 32:41.093
LINDA.

32:41.127 --> 32:43.029
- DR. JACKSON HERE
HAS BEEN TELLING US

32:43.062 --> 32:45.497
ABOUT A CERTAIN NIGHT
ON THE DOCK IN FALMOUTH

32:45.531 --> 32:48.034
20 YEARS AGO.

32:48.067 --> 32:51.737
SOMETHING HAPPENED AND ANN
STOPPED SPEAKING TO HIM.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.572
- ANN TELL YOU ABOUT THAT?

32:53.605 --> 32:54.740
- NO.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.442
UM, BUT I WAS THERE.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.577
- OKAY.

32:58.610 --> 33:00.446
CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED?

33:00.479 --> 33:04.050
- ANN AND I WERE
SKINNY-DIPPING

33:04.083 --> 33:08.187
AND YOU CAME DOWN.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.456
- GO ON.

33:10.489 --> 33:12.458
I NEED TO HEAR THIS.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.425
- HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

33:13.459 --> 33:16.462
- OH, WELL, YOU WERE DRUNK.

33:16.495 --> 33:19.665
SO, UM...

33:19.698 --> 33:22.134
YOU STRIPPED AND JUMPED IN.

33:22.168 --> 33:24.703
- STRIPPED NAKED?
- YES.

33:24.736 --> 33:27.473
ANN GOT UPSET AND...

33:27.506 --> 33:31.577
SHE WENT BACK UP
TO THE HOUSE.

33:31.610 --> 33:32.678
- ANN LEFT?

33:32.711 --> 33:35.114
- YES, BUT I STAYED

33:35.147 --> 33:37.683
AND...
YOU CAME AFTER ME

33:37.716 --> 33:40.319
AND THERE WAS
NO STOPPING YOU AND--

33:40.352 --> 33:42.654
- DID I--

33:42.688 --> 33:44.723
- YEAH, WE HAD SEX ON THE DOCK.

33:44.756 --> 33:46.492
- HOLD ON.

33:46.525 --> 33:47.826
YOU AND JACKSON?

33:47.859 --> 33:49.595
NOT ANN?
- ANN?

33:49.628 --> 33:52.498
OH, NO!
NO.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.334
IT WAS CAP AND ME.

33:55.367 --> 33:59.205
NO, IT WAS--

34:04.243 --> 34:06.345
- LINDA, I AM SO SORRY.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.546
- OH, NO.
DON'T BE.

34:07.579 --> 34:12.718
I MEAN, THAT WAS--THAT WAS
A CRAZY SUMMER FOR ME SEXUALLY.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.420
I WANTED TO DO IT.

34:14.453 --> 34:20.392
I WAS 17
AND I DON'T REGRET IT.

34:20.426 --> 34:24.463
- WHY DID ANN STOP TALKING
TO ME?

34:24.496 --> 34:28.634
- OH, I WAS ANN'S FIRST LOVE.

34:28.667 --> 34:31.270
WE BROKE HER HEART THAT NIGHT.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.505
- [deep exhale]

34:33.539 --> 34:36.675
- OH, GOD,
SHE BLAMED IT ALL ON YOU.

34:36.708 --> 34:39.711
I'M SO SORRY, CAP.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.419
- LET'S GO AND FIND HIM.

34:47.453 --> 34:53.292
LET'S GO AND FIND THAT MAN
THAT ATTACKED MY DAUGHTER.

34:53.325 --> 34:57.496
- FOREARMS ARE MY THING.

34:57.529 --> 35:00.766
I GET OFF ON PINNING WOMEN'S
ARMS HARD

35:00.799 --> 35:04.570
TILL IT HURTS 'EM.

35:04.603 --> 35:07.139
IT GOT TO THE POINT
WHERE I, YOU KNOW,

35:07.173 --> 35:09.408
PINNED ONE TO THE WALL AND,
BAM,

35:09.441 --> 35:11.577
SNAPPED THAT
LIKE A CHICKEN WING.

35:11.610 --> 35:14.846
- IN OUR ONE-ON-ONE
THIS MORNING,

35:14.880 --> 35:20.286
WE TRACED ELLIOT'S BEHAVIOR
BACK TO HIS FATHER.

35:20.319 --> 35:24.323
- THAT SON OF A BITCH PRETTY
MUCH BEAT ME UP EVERY DAY.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.457
AND, YOU KNOW,
HOW I KNEW IT WAS COMING

35:25.491 --> 35:27.326
IS HE'D ROLL UP HIS SLEEVES.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.395
AND THEN, BAM.

35:29.428 --> 35:31.297
- ELLIOT UNCONSCIOUSLY DIRECTS
HIS ANGER

35:31.330 --> 35:34.833
AT THAT FIRST IMAGE
OF THE ABUSE.

35:34.866 --> 35:38.237
- LIKE I SAY, YOU KNOW?

35:38.270 --> 35:39.605
FOREARMS ARE MY THING.

35:39.638 --> 35:41.740
- NOW, WE'VE SEEN HOW THESE
MALE-ONLY SESSIONS

35:41.773 --> 35:45.444
CAN BE HELPFUL
IN FATHER RE-FIGURATION.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.813
SO--
- SO, WE, UM--

35:47.846 --> 35:49.881
WE ALL ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES,
RIGHT?

35:49.915 --> 35:51.717
AND WE SHOW ELLIOT
A LITTLE LOVE, RIGHT?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.352
- THAT'S RIGHT.

35:53.385 --> 35:54.920
- COME ON, GUYS.
ROLL UP YOUR SLEEVES.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.455
- GIVE HIM A HUG.
SHAKE HIM BY THE HAND.

35:56.488 --> 35:57.789
DO WHATEVER FEELS NATURAL.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.492
- ALL RIGHT, BROTHER.
- HEY, MAN.

36:00.526 --> 36:02.294
- HEY.

36:02.328 --> 36:03.495
- YOU TOTALLY ZEROED IN
ON MY ARMS LAST NIGHT.

36:03.529 --> 36:05.697
THEY'RE NOT GONNA HURT YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

36:05.731 --> 36:07.433
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.667
- THANK YOU.
- THANKS.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.670
THANKS, DOC.

36:15.474 --> 36:18.710
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, CLAY?

36:18.744 --> 36:20.879
- I'M NOT BREAKING
THE MODESTY CODE.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.381
- COME ON, CLAY.

36:22.414 --> 36:26.418
HELP A FELLOW ADDICT.

36:35.661 --> 36:38.630
HE NEEDS BOTH ARMS, CLAY.

36:57.616 --> 37:00.852
YOU HAVE A TATTOO.

37:00.886 --> 37:03.489
- IT'S EMBARRASSING.

37:03.522 --> 37:04.423
GONNA HAVE IT LASERED OFF.

37:04.456 --> 37:07.826
- WELL, HEY, MAN,
DOESN'T LOOK THAT BAD.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.596
YEAH. HEY.

37:16.468 --> 37:18.036
- WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

37:18.069 --> 37:20.506
EVERY MALE PATIENT
WAS IN THAT ROOM.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.541
- ONE OF THE FEMALES MAYBE?

37:22.574 --> 37:24.943
- NO, THERE'S NO TRANSGENDERS
IN THIS GROUP.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.513
I MEAN, AN EAVESDROPPER,
ONE OF THE CLEANING STAFF?

37:27.546 --> 37:30.349
- WE CHECKED THE EMPLOYEES
IN UTICA, PHILLY, AND RICHMOND.

37:30.382 --> 37:32.718
THERE'S NO OVERLAP.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.420
- UTICA, PHILLY, RICHMOND.

37:34.453 --> 37:36.455
THAT'S WHERE HE STRUCK?
- YEP.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.691
- WELL, THERE'S AN OVERLAP
IN COMPUTER SYSTEMS.

37:39.725 --> 37:42.661
THOSE THREE REHABS USE
THAT SERVICE.

37:42.694 --> 37:43.962
- "SECURE-FILE.
THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE."

37:43.995 --> 37:45.464
WHAT'S THAT?

37:45.497 --> 37:46.432
- THE THERAPISTS
DICTATE THEIR NOTES

37:46.465 --> 37:48.800
AND THAT COMPANY
STORES THEM ELECTRONICALLY.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.369
BUT IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE SECURE.

37:50.402 --> 37:51.970
- BUT A PERP HACKS
INTO THAT SYSTEM,

37:52.003 --> 37:53.605
HE'D KNOW AS MUCH
AS ANYONE IN THE ROOM.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.707
- EXCEPT HERE.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.443
THEY OFFERED THEIR SERVICES.
WE TURNED THEM DOWN.

37:57.476 --> 37:58.877
- WHY?

37:58.910 --> 37:59.711
- WE DIDN'T NEED THEM.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.447
BRETT KINCAID
DOES TOO GOOD A JOB.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.882
- BRETT THE THERAPIST
DOES YOUR COMPUTERS?

38:07.419 --> 38:09.821
- HE WAS IN THE ROOM...

38:09.855 --> 38:14.793
WHEN I TALKED ABOUT ANN.

38:14.826 --> 38:16.628
- WHERE IS HE?

38:16.662 --> 38:18.730
- LEADING THE WOMEN'S SESSION.

38:18.764 --> 38:20.666
ZOE?

38:20.699 --> 38:21.900
I THOUGHT BRETT
WAS RUNNING THIS.

38:21.933 --> 38:23.502
- NO, HE LEFT.
HE WASN'T FEELING WELL.

38:23.535 --> 38:24.836
- WHERE'S COURTNEY?

38:24.870 --> 38:25.971
- SHE DIDN'T SHOW.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.573
YOU DON'T THINK SHE RELAPSED?

38:27.606 --> 38:29.608
- GIVE ME YOUR PHONE.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.483
COURTNEY, IT'S ELLIOT.
WHERE ARE YOU?

38:37.516 --> 38:40.552
- WHERE DO YOU THINK I AM?

38:40.586 --> 38:42.120
DOWN THE STREET.

38:42.153 --> 38:44.122
I GOT YOUR NOTE
AND I'M HERE WAITING.

38:44.155 --> 38:46.692
- WHERE'S "HERE"?
- MCRYAN'S.

38:46.725 --> 38:48.760
THE COP BAR THAT YOU SUGGESTED.

38:48.794 --> 38:51.730
AND THERE'S NOBODY HERE BUT ME.

38:51.763 --> 38:52.664
- COURTNEY, GET OUT OF THERE.

38:52.698 --> 38:56.402
- [chuckles]
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

38:56.435 --> 38:57.703
- NO, LISTEN TO ME!
GET OUT!

38:57.736 --> 38:59.438
I DIDN'T SEND YOU THERE!

38:59.471 --> 39:02.441
MEET ME AT
ROCKEFELLER CENTER!

39:02.474 --> 39:04.576
- [screams]

39:04.610 --> 39:06.778
- COURTNEY!

39:06.812 --> 39:08.079
- DO YOU KNOW?
WHERE IS SHE?

39:08.113 --> 39:09.548
- ABANDONED COP BAR.

39:09.581 --> 39:15.053
- NO MORE SLUTTY WAYS.

39:15.086 --> 39:18.790
I'M CURING YOU.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.759
MAKING YOU RESPECTABLE.

39:20.792 --> 39:22.428
COME ON.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.477
- GET UP.
GET UP!

39:38.510 --> 39:41.513
- [screams and grunts]

39:47.085 --> 39:49.054
I CURED THEM, CAP.

39:49.087 --> 39:52.691
NOW TELL HIM TO LET ME GO.

39:52.724 --> 39:55.527
- I HOPE THEY LOCK YOU UP
FOR LIFE.

39:55.561 --> 39:57.529
- BRETT KINCAID,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

39:57.563 --> 39:59.498
FOR THE RAPES
OF DEBBIE SHIELDS,

39:59.531 --> 40:02.200
HOLLY DIMEO,
AND THE ASSAULT OF ANN JACKSON.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.436
- I KNEW YOU WERE A COP.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.642
- YOU LOOK GOOD.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.211
- THANKS.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.813
BUT HE LOOKS LIKE HELL THOUGH.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.015
CAP?

40:17.048 --> 40:18.517
- OH.

40:18.550 --> 40:19.485
- HOW ARE YOU?

40:19.518 --> 40:21.987
- [sighs]

40:22.020 --> 40:23.489
CLINIC'S EMPTY.

40:23.522 --> 40:25.457
- ALL OF YOUR PATIENTS LEFT?

40:25.491 --> 40:27.793
- MM-HMM.

40:27.826 --> 40:29.661
BECAUSE I LET A COP IN.

40:29.695 --> 40:31.930
- I AM SORRY.

40:31.963 --> 40:35.501
- I THOUGHT YOU HATED MY WORK.

40:35.534 --> 40:37.969
- SOME OF THOSE GUYS
SHOULD BE LOCKED UP,

40:38.003 --> 40:39.237
BUT MOST OF 'EM,
YOU WERE HELPING.

40:39.270 --> 40:41.673
- THANK YOU.

40:45.143 --> 40:48.980
SO...ANN HASN'T
WOKEN UP YET, BUT...

40:51.149 --> 40:54.152
WHEN SHE DOES...

40:57.155 --> 40:59.491
I'LL BE THERE.
