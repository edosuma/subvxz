<i>Code blue, room 237.</i>

00:14.564 --> 00:17.431
<i>Code blue, room 237.</i>

00:19.869 --> 00:21.860
<i>Dr. Gilbert to the ER, stat.</i>

00:22.005 --> 00:24.166
<i>Dr. Gilbert to the ER, stat.</i>

00:31.414 --> 00:33.143
Clear.

00:35.518 --> 00:38.316
- You need to let the doctors...
- You have to let me in. I'm family.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.389
Give me 300 joules.

00:40.857 --> 00:42.882
- I'm family.
- You have to wait. You can't stay.

00:43.026 --> 00:45.358
Start another IV.

01:12.789 --> 01:13.915
Do what?
This.

01:14.057 --> 01:15.649
This?
Yes.

01:15.792 --> 01:18.659
Family dinner.
There's gotta be a story.

01:25.869 --> 01:27.598
Oh, Mom. Do you need a hand
with anything?

01:27.737 --> 01:28.863
No.

01:31.241 --> 01:32.902
I'm fine.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.870
So does anyone wanna guess
why we're really here?

01:38.014 --> 01:40.812
Think it's possible that your mother
wants to have her children over

01:40.950 --> 01:42.315
- without an agenda?
- No.

01:42.986 --> 01:46.217
- Saul, she cooked a rack of lamb.
- Oh, I know what this is about.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.187
- What's it about?
- It's about me.

01:48.324 --> 01:50.884
- Oh, what a novel conclusion.
- What's so special about you?

01:51.027 --> 01:53.791
Because, apart from the obvious,

01:53.930 --> 01:57.661
thanks to my little startup
that could, Greenatopia,

01:57.801 --> 01:59.496
I paid off my second mortgage
yesterday.

01:59.636 --> 02:00.898
Oh, wow.
Sarah!

02:01.037 --> 02:02.732
- High five.
- That's great.

02:02.872 --> 02:04.464
No offense: That's roast chicken at best.

02:04.607 --> 02:07.542
Yeah, Justin getting a mortgage,
that would be a rack of lamb.

02:08.610 --> 02:11.409
You think maybe she's
sleeping with somebody again?

02:11.548 --> 02:13.709
I don't know. She gets more
action than me, for sure.

02:13.850 --> 02:15.477
Your mother is not
sleeping with anyone.

02:15.618 --> 02:18.280
Well, whatever it is, I'm hungry,
so I am going to the kitchen.

02:18.421 --> 02:21.254
I'm gonna find out
what the hell is going on, okay?

02:21.391 --> 02:24.656
Trust me, Robert. That's not hunger.
That's a very bad mood.

02:24.794 --> 02:26.853
I'll be right back.

02:27.363 --> 02:31.231
- Okay, rack of lamb, everyone.
- It is gorgeous.

02:31.835 --> 02:34.998
- Where are Kitty and Robert?
- They're dealing with something.

02:35.138 --> 02:37.732
- Kevin, what's going on?
- What? I'm his communications director.

02:37.874 --> 02:40.035
- I'm not his marriage counselor.
- We should eat.

02:40.176 --> 02:41.734
I mean, they might be in there forever.

02:41.878 --> 02:44.244
No, we are not going to start
until everyone's at the table.

02:44.380 --> 02:47.907
Okay, then, Mom, can you please
tell us what is going on?

02:48.051 --> 02:49.518
Yeah.

02:51.621 --> 02:53.213
We're having dinner.

02:53.356 --> 02:57.122
- Can't I have my children over without?
- No.

02:58.161 --> 02:59.822
Is it the article? Because I thought

02:59.963 --> 03:01.590
that we were gonna
keep our private life...

03:01.731 --> 03:05.223
Honey, honey, honey, we have
talked and talked about the article.

03:05.368 --> 03:07.268
- I promise you, I am past it.
- Good, because...

03:07.403 --> 03:09.894
- That was a genuine misunderstanding.
- I know, I know.

03:10.039 --> 03:13.634
It's just that we have been
having a lot of those lately.

03:13.776 --> 03:16.973
I know, and I don't want this
to be another one of them.

03:17.113 --> 03:22.483
- So if you're having second thoughts...
- No. No, I'm not. It's just...

03:23.152 --> 03:28.488
I don't know. I don't know.
Maybe being around the entire family...

03:29.125 --> 03:33.289
- Oh, Robert, we're having a baby.
- Is it about the baby?

03:33.429 --> 03:37.923
I just need to know
that we're on the same page.

03:38.368 --> 03:40.893
I mean, if you're gonna do this,
I just need to know

03:41.037 --> 03:44.006
that you're gonna put your family first.

03:44.407 --> 03:46.875
Okay. We are.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.370
We're on the same page.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.782
- Okay?
- Yeah.

03:56.920 --> 03:59.411
This is a very special bottle
of CÃ´te de Nuits.

03:59.555 --> 04:02.388
I want you to cleanse your palates,
otherwise you're not gonna get any.

04:02.525 --> 04:04.789
Cleanse my palate of what?
Mom, can we just start eating?

04:04.928 --> 04:07.055
Justin, relax.

04:07.196 --> 04:09.824
Kevin, can you just toss me
a roll, then, please?

04:09.966 --> 04:12.127
- Well...
Nice catch, Nora.

04:12.268 --> 04:14.168
- Mom.
- For goodness' sakes.

04:14.304 --> 04:15.771
- How's it going with Henry?
Great.

04:15.905 --> 04:18.874
- He wants to have dinner separately.
- We don't do separately.

04:19.007 --> 04:21.374
When are you and Rebecca
gonna be free, Justin?

04:21.511 --> 04:22.842
- Who knows?
- Where is she?

04:22.979 --> 04:26.540
- Is she ever coming back to work?
- Look, I don't know. Just drop it, all right?

04:26.683 --> 04:28.048
Is something going on
with you two?

04:28.184 --> 04:29.674
No, no. Why would you ask?

04:29.819 --> 04:31.946
- Because you're being defensive.
- There's a reason.

04:32.088 --> 04:33.783
All of you
just leave him alone, all right?

04:33.923 --> 04:36.448
- Leave him alone.
- Thank you, Mom.

04:36.993 --> 04:40.190
- How is the job hunt going, honey?
- Oh, my...

04:40.330 --> 04:42.958
I've got a leak under my sink,
if you wanna take a look at that.

04:43.099 --> 04:46.068
- That's awesome.
- Okay. Sorry.

04:46.202 --> 04:47.692
- Can we eat now?
One second.

04:47.837 --> 04:51.102
I have something that I wanna say.
As you all know,

04:51.240 --> 04:53.834
our birth mother is due in two weeks.

04:53.977 --> 04:55.376
- Yeah.
All right.

04:55.511 --> 04:57.308
And, well, it's a boy.

04:57.447 --> 04:59.438
Oh!

04:59.582 --> 05:03.609
No, I'm just kidding. It's a girl.
Just kidding. We don't know.

05:03.753 --> 05:05.243
It's gonna be a surprise.

05:06.556 --> 05:08.751
But I do have something
that I wanna say.

05:08.891 --> 05:11.758
After much soul-searching,

05:11.894 --> 05:15.887
and the hard-fought support
of your amazing sister Kitty,

05:16.299 --> 05:18.426
I've decided I'm running for governor.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.002
- What?
- Kevin.

05:21.137 --> 05:23.071
I knew you were holding out on us.

05:23.206 --> 05:26.369
But I'm not announcing it until next week,
so, Walkers, keep a lid on it.

05:26.509 --> 05:30.878
Seriously, Kitty and I
adore all of you, you're family,

05:31.014 --> 05:33.949
and we just wanted you
to be the first to know.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.607
- Yes. Cheers.
Cheers.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.845
- Cheers.
Governor. Cheers.

05:37.987 --> 05:39.682
Governor.

05:39.822 --> 05:43.349
Speaking of family, I, too,
have an announcement.

05:43.493 --> 05:45.358
- The truth comes out.
- What did I tell you?

05:45.495 --> 05:47.486
I just want you all to know
that last weekend,

05:47.630 --> 05:49.188
I went to Berkeley, and...

05:51.734 --> 05:53.429
...I met your half-brother Ryan.

05:53.569 --> 05:55.594
- What?
- The bastard?

05:55.738 --> 05:58.502
- Kitty.
- See, what'd I tell you? Rack of lamb.

05:58.641 --> 06:00.472
Why would you do?
Because he called me.

06:00.610 --> 06:04.876
- He found out William is his father...
- You didn't have to go up and meet him.

06:05.348 --> 06:07.475
I thought you decided you were
gonna leave this alone.

06:07.617 --> 06:10.586
He is related to you.
It was the right thing to do.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.278
Nora, tell them about the ticket.

06:12.422 --> 06:15.687
You know what your mother did?
She bought him a plane ticket.

06:15.825 --> 06:18.055
He's probably flying here
at this very minute.

06:18.194 --> 06:20.788
- What?
- You can't be serious.

06:20.930 --> 06:23.956
He has the right
to know where he came from.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.795
- Wow.
- Oh, my God.

06:25.935 --> 06:28.301
What's he like?

06:28.905 --> 06:33.171
He's lovely. He's young,
and he needs help growing up, that's all.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.244
Mom, you know what?
Not everybody needs to meet our family

06:36.379 --> 06:39.109
- to be happy.
- Yeah.

06:39.248 --> 06:41.239
- We're miserable.
- Look at Kevin.

06:41.384 --> 06:44.353
- Look how miserable I am.
We're, like, all unhappy.

06:58.601 --> 07:01.434
Your Mom sure knows how
to upstage an announcement.

07:01.571 --> 07:03.664
Oh, yeah.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.776
Yeah, but think of it this way:
It has to go better with the press.

07:07.910 --> 07:11.243
You are so pretty.

07:12.582 --> 07:14.072
You are.

07:15.518 --> 07:17.782
Don't even try.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.988
I thought you wanted me to try.

07:20.123 --> 07:23.251
Well, I wanted you to try
and work on our relationship.

07:23.392 --> 07:25.917
I am working on our relationship.

07:26.062 --> 07:29.759
You know, pretty soon,
we're not gonna have this kind of time.

07:29.899 --> 07:35.235
- Oh, and what kind of time is that?
- This kind.

07:36.639 --> 07:39.802
Don't tell me that
you haven't thought about it.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.204
Well, the...

07:42.612 --> 07:45.308
The thought may have crossed
my mind.

07:46.282 --> 07:48.750
Let's take advantage of it.

08:00.396 --> 08:02.330
- Good morning, Janet.
- Kevin's waiting for you.

08:02.465 --> 08:05.559
You know, sometimes it pays to take time
for the niceties in life.

08:05.701 --> 08:07.635
- Good morning, Kevin.
- Where have you been?

08:07.770 --> 08:10.034
Doesn't anyone say
"good morning" anymore?

08:10.173 --> 08:11.504
You haven't heard?

08:11.641 --> 08:12.903
- What?
- There's been a leak.

08:13.609 --> 08:15.941
- If your family's been talking...
- It's the Drudge Report.

08:16.078 --> 08:18.273
He posted rumors
that you're running for governor.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.712
- What's it say?
- Let's see.

08:21.350 --> 08:24.342
That you would be insane to challenge
an incumbent from your own party,

08:24.487 --> 08:27.081
and if you were to give up your
senate seat and lose the election,

08:27.223 --> 08:30.488
you'd find yourself back on your ranch
in Santa Barbara clearing brush.

08:30.626 --> 08:33.288
We need to get ahead of this.
We need to move the announcement up.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.192
- I agree. When?
- Today. This afternoon.

08:35.331 --> 08:38.027
- Are you kidding?
- We can't let the media take the wheel.

08:38.167 --> 08:40.760
You want to set the new agenda
and end this train wreck?

08:40.903 --> 08:42.803
- We do it now, today.
- Okay, fine.

08:42.938 --> 08:43.996
Good, and put me outside.

08:44.140 --> 08:45.971
I'm running
as an eco-friendly Republican.

08:46.108 --> 08:48.941
- Put me in that California sunshine.
- We could do it on the roof.

08:49.078 --> 08:51.205
And polish the speech.
California's economy is green...

08:51.347 --> 08:52.814
I know, California will lead the way

08:52.949 --> 08:55.417
with economic incentives
on plug-ins, hydro, solar power.

08:55.551 --> 08:58.748
- I polished it this morning.
- Oh, good.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.216
When was the last time I
told you you were doing a good job?

09:02.358 --> 09:03.985
You've never told me that.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.559
- Really?
- No.

09:06.829 --> 09:09.389
- Well, you're doing a good job.
- Thanks.

09:09.532 --> 09:11.329
- Keep it up.
- I will.

09:12.735 --> 09:14.965
This is getting awkward.
Do you want a hug or something?

09:15.104 --> 09:16.867
- No.
- Good.

09:17.006 --> 09:18.337
<i>I found the leak.</i>

09:18.474 --> 09:22.433
I know where the leak is, Justin.
The question is can you fix it?

09:22.578 --> 09:25.069
Yeah, I think so.
Hand me a wrench.

09:25.214 --> 09:26.875
Thank god for brothers.

09:27.016 --> 09:28.540
Why did you ask me to do this, anyway?

09:28.684 --> 09:31.448
Because Tommy's busy
and Kevin's a non-starter.

09:31.587 --> 09:33.919
I guess I could have asked Ryan.

09:34.056 --> 09:35.318
Oh, don't even say that.

09:35.458 --> 09:39.394
Well, if he makes a visit down here,
we're gonna have to deal with it.

09:39.528 --> 09:41.826
- Have you told Rebecca yet?
- No. Are you kidding me?

09:41.964 --> 09:44.455
That's the last thing she needs.
Remember with her whole thing:

09:44.600 --> 09:47.694
"Am I a Walker or am I not a Walker?"
I don't need her worried that, you know,

09:47.837 --> 09:49.532
Ryan's her replacement.

09:49.672 --> 09:52.505
- She's gonna have to find out eventually.
- Well, not now.

09:52.642 --> 09:55.634
- We have enough problems.
- Hm? What's with that?

09:55.778 --> 09:57.609
Nothing. Ow!

09:57.747 --> 09:59.874
- What's going on with you and Rebecca?
- Sarah...

10:00.016 --> 10:03.315
- Okay, we had a fight, and she took off.
- She just took off?

10:03.452 --> 10:04.544
Yeah. She took off.

10:04.687 --> 10:08.350
- Well, you must have done something.
- Nothing. It was actually about work stuff.

10:08.491 --> 10:10.186
Well, yeah, you do need to get a job.

10:10.326 --> 10:14.262
Her work, Sarah, not mine. All right?
She was talking about Ojai,

10:14.397 --> 10:16.194
and then she started
accusing Tommy of stuff...

10:16.332 --> 10:18.527
Wait. You guys were fighting
about Tommy?

10:18.668 --> 10:22.570
Look, the whole thing is ridiculous.
She hacked into Tommy's computer...

10:22.705 --> 10:24.172
She hacked into his computer?

10:24.307 --> 10:27.470
She didn't hack into his computer,
but she checked it when he wasn't around.

10:27.610 --> 10:31.011
The point is, when I started defending our
family, she was acting like I betrayed her.

10:31.147 --> 10:33.081
What did she find
on Tommy's computer?

10:33.215 --> 10:35.342
I don't know. It was, like,
it was photographs of land

10:35.484 --> 10:37.748
that Ojai had bought,
but the dates didn't match up,

10:37.887 --> 10:40.378
so somehow that means Tommy
is trying to screw over Holly,

10:40.523 --> 10:42.184
which is crazy,
because out of all of us,

10:42.325 --> 10:45.055
Tommy's the only one
that actually likes Holly.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.989
- Did she tell Holly about this?
- I don't know.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.001
You don't think there's
any truth to this, do you?

10:53.135 --> 10:57.128
No. No. Come on. It's a stretch.

10:57.273 --> 10:59.002
What do you mean, the deal closed?

10:59.141 --> 11:01.507
It came down from Legal
first thing this morning. It's done.

11:01.644 --> 11:04.112
No, no. Then you have to undo it.

11:04.246 --> 11:06.111
Holly, the shares have
already been exchanged.

11:06.248 --> 11:07.306
<i>Once the deal closes...</i>

11:07.450 --> 11:11.079
The sale of Crawford Orchards
was not done in good faith.

11:11.220 --> 11:14.451
He completely misrepresented
himself to the board.

11:14.590 --> 11:16.717
And if you were a public company,
he might go to jail,

11:16.859 --> 11:19.555
but Ojai Foods is a private company
with its own bylaws,

11:19.695 --> 11:21.788
<i>which, thanks to William,
have a lot of wiggle room.</i>

11:21.931 --> 11:24.764
Tommy knew this, and it puts us
into murky waters.

11:24.900 --> 11:28.597
You can go into litigation, but right now,
I just don't see any hard evidence.

11:28.738 --> 11:31.366
Well, there has to be something
in the files that I sent over.

11:31.507 --> 11:35.307
I'm not through all of them yet, but so far,
I haven't found anything actionable.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.211
Rebecca?

11:39.348 --> 11:42.010
Well, keep looking. I have to go.

11:42.151 --> 11:45.552
Oh, my God.
Rebecca, where have you been?

11:45.688 --> 11:47.280
Hi.

11:48.023 --> 11:51.083
- Um, I was in New York.
- New York?

11:51.227 --> 11:53.058
Yeah.

11:53.863 --> 11:56.024
I went to see my dad.

11:56.665 --> 11:59.498
- You went to see David?
- Yes.

11:59.635 --> 12:03.628
You know, when I was there, everything
sort of happened so quickly, and, well...

12:08.344 --> 12:09.743
Hi, Holly.

12:11.180 --> 12:12.772
No.

12:13.282 --> 12:15.182
This is not happening.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.049
Well, I think they all took that
reasonably well.

12:23.192 --> 12:25.854
Reasonably well? What are you
talking about? All hell broke loose.

12:25.995 --> 12:28.190
Saul, come on. He's a kid.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.797
I had no choice. He reached out.

12:30.266 --> 12:33.030
I wish I knew why he changed his mind
about coming back with me.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.603
Nora, he just found out that his father
wasn't his father.

12:35.738 --> 12:37.729
What do you expect?
Cancel the ticket,

12:37.873 --> 12:39.704
get back your miles.
That's what I would do.

12:39.842 --> 12:41.605
Hello.
Hi.

12:41.744 --> 12:43.371
- An hour and 15 minutes.
- What?

12:43.512 --> 12:45.446
That's how long it took me to get here.

12:45.581 --> 12:48.049
One hour and 15 minutes.
There was no traffic,

12:48.184 --> 12:50.675
the sun was shining...
I need a cup of coffee.

12:50.820 --> 12:55.951
- You're in a good mood.
- Yeah. Yeah, I am, actually.

12:56.091 --> 12:57.820
You're not mad at me about Ryan?

12:57.960 --> 13:01.896
Well, Mother, being mad would require
that I was surprised, which I'm not.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.896
- See?
- You love saving people,

13:04.033 --> 13:05.728
and now you're saving Ryan.

13:07.570 --> 13:10.334
See? It's a movie, right?

13:11.373 --> 13:13.705
Well, hopefully Ryan will stay
where he is.

13:15.377 --> 13:19.336
Yeah. Oh. Sorry. That's probably Robert.

13:20.115 --> 13:21.343
Oh, no. It's Trish.

13:22.384 --> 13:23.874
Hello?

13:25.721 --> 13:27.484
Yes.

13:29.258 --> 13:30.384
Oh, my God.

13:31.494 --> 13:33.485
No. Oh, no, no. Of course.

13:33.629 --> 13:36.189
Of course I will be there.
L... Oh, yes.

13:36.332 --> 13:37.799
I will see you soon.

13:37.933 --> 13:39.730
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

13:39.869 --> 13:42.030
Trish. Trish is in labor.

13:42.171 --> 13:44.833
- She's having the baby.
- Trish is in labor. Trish is in labor.

13:44.974 --> 13:46.373
We're having a baby.

13:46.509 --> 13:48.101
Oh, my God. Oh, God.
Where's my purse?

13:48.244 --> 13:51.577
- All right, calm down. Just relax.
- Where are my car keys?

13:51.714 --> 13:54.547
- I don't know where your keys are. Mom.
- I had my purse a minute ago.

13:54.683 --> 13:55.911
- Mom.
- What?

13:56.852 --> 13:58.285
We're having a baby.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.352
- My God. Okay, don't panic.
- Don't panic.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.459
Where's my car keys?
I left them here somewhere.

14:15.070 --> 14:16.537
<i>- Hey, Mom.
It's not your mother.</i>

14:16.672 --> 14:18.196
Hey, Saul.
What are you doing at Mom's?

14:18.340 --> 14:20.240
<i>- Kitty's having her baby.
- What?</i>

14:20.376 --> 14:22.469
- Kitty's having her baby.
- Kitty's what?

14:22.611 --> 14:25.136
- Kitty's having her baby. Well, Trish is.
- Congratulations, Kitty.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.339
It's not Kitty. It's Saul.

14:26.482 --> 14:28.450
- When did you find out?
- What do you mean when?

14:28.584 --> 14:31.178
I was here, Kitty was here, Trish called
and said her water broke.

14:31.320 --> 14:32.753
Oh, my God. Her water broke?

14:32.888 --> 14:34.753
I know. It's crazy. It's two weeks early.

14:34.890 --> 14:36.152
Two weeks early is nothing.

14:36.292 --> 14:38.419
That's ready. It's cooked.
Kitty's having her baby.

14:38.561 --> 14:39.619
- What?
- Talk to Justin.

14:39.762 --> 14:41.559
- No way.
- Oh, yeah. It's happening, bro.

14:41.697 --> 14:44.723
- Okay, where do I go? What hospital?
- Sarah, what hospital?

14:44.867 --> 14:47.597
Nobody's going anywhere.
I'm getting a list from Uncle Saul.

14:47.736 --> 14:48.828
A list?

14:48.971 --> 14:51.098
Things Trish and Kitty need.
It's their birth plan.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.969
All right, hold on.
I'm sensing errands.

14:54.109 --> 14:56.236
- Wash layette.
- Okay, they're newborn baby clothes.

14:56.378 --> 14:58.175
Kitty got a bunch of them
for her baby shower.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.339
Justin can drive up to Santa Barbara,
pick them up.

15:00.482 --> 15:02.416
- Santa Barbara?
- It's a nice day. What else?

15:02.551 --> 15:06.112
CDs. Elvis Costello, Sister Sledge,
"Steppin' Out!" by Harold Vick...

15:06.255 --> 15:08.450
Oh! I love that one.
She has good taste in music.

15:08.591 --> 15:09.956
Tell Tommy he's gonna be on music.

15:10.092 --> 15:12.856
- I'll call him with the list. Next?
- Sandalwood candles.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.087
I'd try Kevin for that.

15:14.229 --> 15:17.027
<i>- She is? Wait, right now?
Yes, now.</i>

15:17.166 --> 15:19.066
What happened to that gift bag
you brought home?

15:19.201 --> 15:21.965
- There was a candle in it, I think.
- Yeah, I threw it out.

15:22.104 --> 15:23.731
<i>- You threw it out?
- It was sandalwood.</i>

15:23.872 --> 15:26.602
- Kevin.
- What? You hate sandalwood.

15:26.742 --> 15:29.040
- Has Kitty talked to Robert?
- How far along is she?

15:29.178 --> 15:32.375
All I know is that her water broke.
That's all I know.

15:32.514 --> 15:36.006
Okay, listen.
We have a bit of a situation here.

15:36.151 --> 15:37.778
What do you mean? What situation?

15:38.454 --> 15:42.891
Um, there was a leak, and so I had
to move the announcement up to today.

15:43.692 --> 15:47.628
Yeah, but it's here on the roof, so I could
basically walk to the hospital, and...

15:47.763 --> 15:50.630
Oh, Robert, come on.
No, you can't take that chance.

15:50.766 --> 15:53.291
No, I know. You know what?

15:53.435 --> 15:55.528
I'm just gonna come to the hospital
as soon as I can.

15:55.671 --> 15:57.366
And if she's having the baby, I'll cancel.

15:57.506 --> 16:01.033
And if not, then I'll sneak out,
do the announcement and be right back.

16:01.176 --> 16:03.269
All right, but please, Robert.
You cannot miss this.

16:03.412 --> 16:08.645
Kitty, stop. I love you,
and I love this baby,

16:08.784 --> 16:11.981
and it's gonna be my first priority.
I am not gonna miss this birth.

16:12.488 --> 16:15.150
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- This way.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.951
Congratulations.

16:24.233 --> 16:28.260
- Hey.
- Kitty. Hi. Come on in.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.928
Wow. Um...

16:30.072 --> 16:32.905
- Trish, you look great.
She's doing great.

16:33.609 --> 16:35.600
How you doing?

16:37.346 --> 16:41.077
- All right, I'll be back in a little while.
- Okay, sure.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.644
- Sorry about the short notice.
- Wow.

16:44.987 --> 16:48.081
- Where's Robert?
- Oh, um, he's on his way.

16:48.223 --> 16:51.852
- He had a little bit of a crisis at work.
- Oh, no rush.

16:51.994 --> 16:53.393
I'm only at three centimeters.

16:53.529 --> 16:54.826
Right. And my Mom is downstairs,

16:54.963 --> 16:56.726
and she's buying
every magazine in the store.

16:56.865 --> 16:59.390
And my uncle is making sure
you have everything that you wanted.

16:59.535 --> 17:01.935
The music, the candles, the lavender,
the geranium, the...

17:02.071 --> 17:04.198
- Kitty, breathe.
- The... The...

17:06.442 --> 17:09.069
Right. Right, right.

17:09.211 --> 17:11.577
Aren't you the one
who's supposed to be doing that?

17:15.050 --> 17:18.109
- Why is that going up?
- Oh.

17:18.252 --> 17:20.550
That just monitors my contractions.

17:20.689 --> 17:23.249
And what does that one do?

17:23.392 --> 17:25.723
The top one
monitors the baby's heart rate.

17:25.861 --> 17:29.126
- Oh.
- Here, listen.

17:36.572 --> 17:37.903
Oh, God.

17:41.477 --> 17:44.503
You know what? I can't.
I can't start crying yet.

17:44.646 --> 17:47.581
No, you can't.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.915
I'm just trying to understand
how a fight with Justin

17:52.054 --> 17:53.749
prompted you to fly across country

17:53.889 --> 17:57.655
to see the person that's least likely
to be there for you in a time of need.

17:57.793 --> 17:59.624
Oh, come on.
Just give me a break, Holly.

17:59.762 --> 18:04.426
You know, I am sorry, but your sudden
need to be a father is hard to swallow.

18:04.566 --> 18:06.534
The only reason
he left L.A. In the first place

18:06.668 --> 18:08.067
was because I asked him to.

18:08.203 --> 18:11.866
Oh, and you gallantly decided
to obey her wishes.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.703
- Was that hard for you?
- It was, actually.

18:14.843 --> 18:16.834
And breaking up with me,
was that hard too?

18:16.979 --> 18:20.847
- I told you, he did it for me.
- Oh, there's always a reason for it.

18:20.983 --> 18:25.317
- You wanna drag our history into this?
- Why not? I've never run away from it.

18:25.454 --> 18:28.821
- That's true. You prefer to wallow in it.
- What is that supposed to mean?

18:28.957 --> 18:30.322
Okay, none of this is helping.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.895
Mom, I came here because I needed
to explain some things to you.

18:35.297 --> 18:37.026
Justin and I got into a fight.

18:37.166 --> 18:39.634
- You told me that.
- I know.

18:40.269 --> 18:41.759
But the reason was because

18:42.805 --> 18:44.898
I thought there was something wrong
with the deal.

18:45.240 --> 18:49.643
And when I talked to Justin about it,
he made me feel like I was crazy,

18:49.778 --> 18:51.837
and I didn't wanna bring it up
to you right away

18:51.980 --> 18:55.143
because I honestly just didn't
wanna upset you, so...

18:55.984 --> 18:57.576
So you went to him?

18:58.787 --> 19:00.084
She was worried about you.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.122
David, this is really
none of your business.

19:02.257 --> 19:05.693
What is your problem, Holly?
She obviously needed to talk to someone

19:05.828 --> 19:09.821
- who has her best interests at heart.
- Yeah, like her deadbeat dad?

19:09.965 --> 19:11.057
Mom.
- Screw you, Holly.

19:12.234 --> 19:13.394
I'll call you later, Rebecca.

19:16.305 --> 19:17.932
Why do you need to be like that?

19:20.909 --> 19:22.968
It... I'm sorry.

19:24.580 --> 19:29.176
I really... I can't deal with him
on top of everything else.

19:29.318 --> 19:32.082
What? What else?

19:33.322 --> 19:35.847
You were right, Rebecca.

19:37.025 --> 19:40.085
There is something wrong
with the Crawford deal.

19:42.731 --> 19:46.292
Tommy is trying to force me
out of Ojai.

19:47.836 --> 19:50.396
Mom, what are you gonna do?

19:52.207 --> 19:55.233
I am not gonna let him
get away with this.

19:57.412 --> 19:58.902
Okay.

19:59.047 --> 20:00.947
You have to dig into the crack.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.983
- Excuse me?
- Have to find the lower anchor.

20:03.118 --> 20:04.745
- You'll feel a click.
- Yeah. I see it.

20:04.887 --> 20:06.047
- Did that click?
- Yeah.

20:06.188 --> 20:08.383
Good, good. No, no, no.
The other way around.

20:08.523 --> 20:10.753
- The child rides backwards?
- That's right. It's safer.

20:10.893 --> 20:13.088
- No wonder they spit up all the time.
Come on, guys.

20:13.228 --> 20:17.028
This is not rocket science.
It's an infant car seat.

20:17.165 --> 20:18.530
What are you talking about, Sarah?

20:18.667 --> 20:21.227
There are straps and tethers
and anchors...

20:21.370 --> 20:23.395
- It's mind-boggling.
- Come on.

20:23.538 --> 20:25.403
You know that every CD store in this city

20:25.540 --> 20:28.441
- has gone out of business?
- Don't tell me you didn't get the music.

20:28.577 --> 20:31.876
I got Sister Sledge and Elvis Costello,
but Harold Vick,

20:32.014 --> 20:33.413
I couldn't even find him on iTunes.

20:33.548 --> 20:36.108
I have everything he's ever done.
The man is a total virtuoso.

20:36.251 --> 20:37.741
Why didn't you speak up before?

20:37.886 --> 20:40.821
I did speak up, but for some
unknown reason, your sister

20:40.956 --> 20:43.390
preferred to torture me
with car-seat installation.

20:43.525 --> 20:45.390
I see. Well, can you go home
and grab it?

20:45.527 --> 20:46.960
- Of course, happily.
- Okay.

20:47.095 --> 20:48.585
- See you.
Don't worry about me.

20:48.730 --> 20:51.528
- I only make a living with my hands.
- I'll be right there, Scotty.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.636
- Hey, Tommy, can I have a word?
- What?

20:54.770 --> 20:57.432
Are you making some kind
of move against Holly?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.598
Why are you
nosing around my business?

20:59.741 --> 21:01.834
I thought you were all about Greenatopia
these days.

21:01.977 --> 21:03.638
Is something wrong at Ojai?

21:04.479 --> 21:07.312
Why do you always come to the
conclusion that something is wrong?

21:07.449 --> 21:10.145
You know, I might
actually know what I'm doing.

21:10.285 --> 21:14.312
In fact, I think you might be really,
really surprised in the next few days.

21:15.924 --> 21:17.949
Okay, guys, could I please
get a hand in here?

21:18.093 --> 21:20.186
Just relax, all right?

21:25.334 --> 21:31.034
Richard. Ricardo. Robert. Speaking of...

21:31.440 --> 21:35.069
Mom, he's coming, okay? He's coming.
I just talked to him.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.211
Quiet.

21:41.616 --> 21:43.049
It's a picture of a beach.

21:43.185 --> 21:45.813
I mean, she wanted it as her focal,
and she left it at home,

21:45.954 --> 21:48.889
and I don't know, maybe this will work.

21:49.725 --> 21:54.526
- Rutherford. Ryan. Oh, sorry.
- No, actually, that's...

21:54.663 --> 21:57.393
Ryan. Why not?
That'll give you two of them to coddle.

21:57.532 --> 21:59.432
I don't wanna coddle him.

21:59.568 --> 22:01.297
- I'm joking.
- You know what, Kitty?

22:01.436 --> 22:04.200
You just think of him as your
father's illegitimate son,

22:04.339 --> 22:07.775
but as far as I'm concerned,
Ryan is a member of our family.

22:07.909 --> 22:12.437
Fine, Mother. I get it. I guess that he
deserves all the help that he can get.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.707
But the plane ticket...

22:13.849 --> 22:15.578
You know, Saul should never have...

22:15.717 --> 22:18.880
There is no way we really know that
that boy is even gonna...

22:19.021 --> 22:21.785
Who's Ryan?
Oh, God, Trish. Sorry.

22:21.923 --> 22:23.982
Sorry. You scared me.

22:24.126 --> 22:26.287
- Are you okay?
- Sorry we woke you up.

22:26.428 --> 22:30.057
Oh, no, no. The contractions did.

22:31.833 --> 22:35.200
So, um, were you listening?

22:35.337 --> 22:38.898
Of course, and keep going.

22:39.041 --> 22:40.838
I wanna hear more about
this illegitimate son.

22:40.976 --> 22:42.910
No, no, no. We really...
You know what?

22:43.045 --> 22:46.071
The truth is, we don't know, really,
anything about him.

22:46.214 --> 22:49.945
Oh, Kitty. I'm not judging.
My uncle had two of them.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.715
Please, by all means, distract me.

22:52.854 --> 22:57.484
Well, I just... No, I want you to know
that this is not a reflection of how...

22:57.626 --> 22:59.253
Kitty, tell the damn story.

22:59.394 --> 23:01.055
The first one I knew about was Holly.

23:01.196 --> 23:03.824
But Holly is not Ryan's mother.
No, that's Connie.

23:03.965 --> 23:06.559
And then there's Rebecca.
Rebecca actually is Holly's child.

23:06.701 --> 23:10.398
At first we thought that Rebecca
was her father's illegitimate daughter...

23:11.973 --> 23:14.271
And we have the call
with the distributors at 4.

23:14.409 --> 23:15.467
Right.

23:15.610 --> 23:17.237
There's a board meeting
set for Wednesday.

23:17.379 --> 23:20.974
Oh, I thought there wasn't a board
meeting scheduled till next month.

23:21.116 --> 23:23.550
It came from Tommy's office.

23:23.685 --> 23:25.243
Is there an agenda?

23:25.387 --> 23:27.582
Not yet. I could check for you.

23:27.722 --> 23:29.747
No, that's okay. I'll talk to Tommy.

23:32.027 --> 23:34.495
Could you shut the door, please?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.297
Holly, I told you we're
gonna need some time.

23:40.435 --> 23:45.998
<i>I don't have any time. Tommy just
called a board meeting to vote me out.</i>

23:46.141 --> 23:49.008
Well, we could sue him now,

23:49.144 --> 23:51.237
but that could cost you
tens of thousands of dollars

23:51.379 --> 23:54.007
and take months, if not years,
without any guarantee of success.

23:54.149 --> 23:58.483
Don't do that. Don't talk to me
as if I were a lost cause.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.315
No, I just want you to be protected.

24:00.455 --> 24:03.151
If Tommy moves against you,
you still have the value of your shares.

24:03.291 --> 24:06.488
Wait, wait, wait. What about the money
that he used to buy Crawford Orchards?

24:06.628 --> 24:08.619
He doesn't have that kind of liquidity.

24:08.763 --> 24:12.824
Everything that he owns is tied up
in Ojai Foods or Walker Landing.

24:12.968 --> 24:15.630
Well, nothing you sent over
has any details of that transaction.

24:15.770 --> 24:18.534
- So subpoena him.
- Holly, please.

24:18.673 --> 24:20.004
<i>If you take this into litigation,</i>

24:20.142 --> 24:23.839
you could end up bankrupting yourself,
Walker Landing, Ojai Foods.

24:23.979 --> 24:26.914
<i>There could be nothing left.
Is it really worth it to you?</i>

24:27.048 --> 24:30.040
Yes, it might be.

24:31.953 --> 24:33.011
We have a problem.

24:33.155 --> 24:35.715
- Fix it. I gotta go to the hospital.
- Governor's here.

24:36.458 --> 24:40.019
- Oh, no. That cannot be good.
- No, it's not good. She's in the lobby.

24:40.962 --> 24:44.557
All right. Okay. Call Kitty
and tell her that something's come up.

24:44.699 --> 24:47.361
- She's gonna be pissed.
- Yeah, she's not the only one.

24:50.605 --> 24:53.073
- What the hell are you doing?
- You're upset.

24:53.208 --> 24:57.770
Upset? I have to read online that you're
about to announce a run for my office?

24:57.913 --> 25:00.404
If I'd termed out, I would have at least
deserved a phone call.

25:00.549 --> 25:02.517
And you would've gotten one,
but it began to leak,

25:02.651 --> 25:05.347
- so I had to move up the announcement.
- Now you have to cancel it.

25:05.954 --> 25:09.014
Why? You told me yourself
you weren't gonna run.

25:09.157 --> 25:11.625
I was in the middle of a crisis
when I said that.

25:12.260 --> 25:15.593
I've told my husband everything,
and no, he was not happy about my affair,

25:15.730 --> 25:16.958
but he has forgiven me.

25:17.098 --> 25:19.623
And if it comes out,
the voters will forgive me also.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.235
I am running, Robert.

25:22.837 --> 25:25.067
Then that puts us in a difficult position.

25:25.207 --> 25:27.107
You don't really think
that you are gonna go up

25:27.242 --> 25:29.369
against a sitting governor
from your own party...

25:29.511 --> 25:31.308
Eve, with all due respect,
you can't win.

25:31.446 --> 25:33.914
Your numbers are below 38 percent,
you've bet wrong

25:34.049 --> 25:36.574
on every economic and environmental
issue the voters care about.

25:36.718 --> 25:37.980
They're gonna throw you out,

25:38.119 --> 25:40.485
and our party with it,
and I'm not gonna let that happen.

25:42.023 --> 25:44.082
If you go forward with this,

25:44.226 --> 25:46.626
I'm gonna use every weapon
at my disposal,

25:46.761 --> 25:48.058
every relationship I have,

25:48.196 --> 25:50.391
every ounce of political capital
I have amassed.

25:50.532 --> 25:53.000
I am gonna cut you off at the knees.

25:54.002 --> 25:56.994
You know, with your personal history,
I'd be careful who you threaten.

25:58.607 --> 26:01.075
Look, we can do this clean
or we can do this ugly,

26:01.209 --> 26:05.339
but unless I'm pushed, I'd like to leave you
with your political legacy intact.

26:06.815 --> 26:10.842
Nice talking to you, Robert.
Give my best to Kitty.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.362
You're doing great, Trish.

26:23.865 --> 26:28.097
Okay, here comes the sandalwood.

26:28.770 --> 26:33.503
Okay. Okay, fine. You know what?
Let's visualize.

26:33.642 --> 26:36.543
- All I can visualize is an epidural.
- Right, but you know what?

26:36.678 --> 26:38.839
- The doctor is gonna be here any minute.
- Okay, okay.

26:38.980 --> 26:41.244
But in the meantime, here we go.

26:41.383 --> 26:44.546
Trish, Trish, it's a beach.
Look at the waves. They're blue,

26:44.686 --> 26:47.280
and they're bobbing up and down.

26:47.422 --> 26:48.480
Oh, God.

26:48.623 --> 26:51.217
- Up and down.
- I feel seasick.

26:51.359 --> 26:53.554
It's a bay.
There are no waves.

26:54.162 --> 26:57.029
What's that smell? Is that sandalwood?

26:57.165 --> 26:59.633
Oh, wait. I thought
that you liked sandalwood.

26:59.768 --> 27:02.498
- Okay, I'll blow it out.
- Blow out the candle. It's making me sick.

27:02.637 --> 27:05.197
- Here, have an ice chip.
- I just want my epidural.

27:05.340 --> 27:07.900
This is outrageous. I'm gonna
go find the anesthesiologist.

27:08.043 --> 27:12.139
- I'm gonna go talk to the nurse.
- Oh, God. Why did I do this to myself?

27:12.280 --> 27:15.909
Oh, Trish, because you are
the most generous, most incredible,

27:16.051 --> 27:18.713
and you are the bravest person
that I know.

27:18.853 --> 27:19.911
Oh!

27:20.055 --> 27:22.023
Oh, god. No, another one.
It's coming back.

27:22.157 --> 27:24.250
- It's another one.
- Okay, know what we're gonna do?

27:24.392 --> 27:26.724
We're gonna do lavender.
Gonna do lavender pressure points.

27:26.861 --> 27:28.954
No. Screw the pressure points.
I need you.

27:29.097 --> 27:31.657
You know what?
Let's roll you over on your side.

27:31.800 --> 27:33.495
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, here we go.

27:33.635 --> 27:34.795
Ready? Easy, easy, easy.

27:36.504 --> 27:38.768
Okay, not a good idea.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.670
Okay, come on back.
We're gonna breathe.

27:40.809 --> 27:42.538
- We're gonna breathe. Breathe.
- Okay.

27:44.813 --> 27:47.611
- Well?
- Damn it. Isn't there any aspirin here?

27:47.749 --> 27:50.718
- Yeah, in that drawer.
- No, I already looked.

27:51.386 --> 27:53.411
- Didn't go well.
- No, she's changed her mind.

27:53.555 --> 27:55.420
She's running.

27:56.891 --> 27:59.860
- How can there be no aspirin here?
- Right here.

28:01.029 --> 28:03.725
Thanks. You know, maybe she's right.

28:03.865 --> 28:06.698
Maybe people are just gonna see this
as me cutting in line.

28:06.835 --> 28:08.860
Damn it. I hate
these childproof caps.

28:09.003 --> 28:11.301
- You better get used to them. Here, give.
- I've got it.

28:11.740 --> 28:13.537
And how is this happening
to me today?

28:13.675 --> 28:15.575
All I should be thinking about
is having a baby,

28:15.710 --> 28:17.644
and instead I've got
the press corps on the roof.

28:17.779 --> 28:21.875
It's gonna be a bloodbath the minute
they ask me about the current governor.

28:22.350 --> 28:24.545
You don't have to change your mind
just because she did.

28:24.686 --> 28:27.280
Plenty of people have run
against incumbents in the past. Okay?

28:27.822 --> 28:31.553
I'm just trying to be practical.
I have got only one shot at this.

28:31.693 --> 28:33.923
Robert, I'm a gay Democrat.

28:34.062 --> 28:36.428
Only reason I came to work for you
is because I believed you

28:36.564 --> 28:41.092
when you said you wanted to govern
in a different way and now was our time.

28:44.038 --> 28:45.903
If you ask me, Governor Kern
is only interested

28:46.040 --> 28:48.008
in keeping things the way
they always have been,

28:48.743 --> 28:52.110
which is why I think you can beat her
with one hand tied behind your back.

28:54.983 --> 28:56.507
Thanks.

28:59.020 --> 29:02.217
Because I think I'm gonna have to.

29:02.357 --> 29:04.655
All right, I need to talk
to Gordon Alexander,

29:04.793 --> 29:06.727
and get me Ted Carmichael
from the RNC.

29:06.861 --> 29:07.919
Done.

29:12.267 --> 29:15.134
- What did you say to Sarah?
- Excuse me?

29:15.270 --> 29:19.036
Look, Holly is trying to take Ojai from us.
I am trying to stop her for all of us.

29:19.174 --> 29:23.201
You cannot say a word to Sarah
about this until it is done.

29:23.344 --> 29:24.811
Tommy, why would I do that?

29:24.946 --> 29:27.972
The minute I said anything,
she'd be liable. I don't want that.

29:28.116 --> 29:30.641
- Sarah.
- Hey.

29:30.785 --> 29:33.447
- Hey.
- What's going on?

29:34.189 --> 29:35.952
- Nothing.
- Just talking about Ryan.

29:36.090 --> 29:37.114
Oh.

29:37.258 --> 29:39.624
You know, I'm actually
curious about meeting him.

29:39.761 --> 29:43.026
Yeah, well, on that note,
I'm gonna get a sandwich.

29:45.366 --> 29:47.129
Why is everybody
so scared of Ryan?

29:47.268 --> 29:49.293
Come on. He comes down here,
he sees our house,

29:49.437 --> 29:51.962
he discovers he had a dad
with a company called Ojai Foods...

29:52.640 --> 29:54.767
Is that what you're worried about,
the money?

29:54.909 --> 29:56.877
This is about protecting my family.

29:58.446 --> 30:01.643
Tommy, are you trying
to take back Ojai?

30:03.051 --> 30:04.177
Yeah.

30:05.220 --> 30:06.312
Is it legal?

30:07.388 --> 30:10.221
Tommy? For God's sake,
tell me it's legal.

30:10.358 --> 30:12.223
- What? Stop it.
- Is it?

30:12.894 --> 30:16.022
I'm so sick of you standing there
in judgment of me.

30:16.164 --> 30:17.893
You quit Ojai.

30:18.032 --> 30:22.628
You have a lot of nerve
acting like I have to answer to you.

30:23.638 --> 30:25.538
I'm just concerned.

30:26.107 --> 30:28.337
Well, that's not my problem.

30:32.180 --> 30:33.807
Hey.

30:34.949 --> 30:37.884
As if my day could get any worse.

30:38.019 --> 30:40.317
Rebecca's not here.

30:40.955 --> 30:44.049
I already talked to Rebecca.
She told me what was going on.

30:44.192 --> 30:47.992
Don't mistake Rebecca
welcoming you into her life

30:48.129 --> 30:50.563
as an invitation back into mine.

30:50.698 --> 30:52.529
She's really worried about you, Holly.

30:52.667 --> 30:54.931
She says that you're in
a lot of trouble here.

30:55.069 --> 30:59.802
David, I have run out of ways to tell you
that my life is none of your business.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.306
I never said it was.

31:02.710 --> 31:04.803
So at the risk
of you throwing something,

31:04.946 --> 31:07.540
have you ever considered
that maybe you would be better off

31:07.682 --> 31:09.206
walking away from this company?

31:09.350 --> 31:14.083
Wow. You recommend walking away.
There's a shocker.

31:14.222 --> 31:16.122
That's not what happened
with us, Holly.

31:16.257 --> 31:18.350
Mm.

31:18.493 --> 31:21.326
I mean, so what
if Tommy Walker kicks you out?

31:21.462 --> 31:23.726
It's not like you're gonna
be on the street.

31:23.865 --> 31:27.028
He still has to pay you for your shares,
so take your money

31:27.168 --> 31:28.567
and start your own business.

31:28.703 --> 31:32.799
- Frankly, your opinion is irrelevant.
- It always was, wasn't it?

31:32.941 --> 31:36.502
- Nothing compared to William Walker.
- No, he has nothing to do with this.

31:36.644 --> 31:39.010
Oh, he has everything
to do with this, Holly.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.081
I mean, that's why you're here, isn't it?

31:41.215 --> 31:44.981
You tried to preserve some perverted idea
of a life the two of you shared?

31:45.119 --> 31:47.952
- Go to hell.
- Do you wanna know why I left?

31:48.089 --> 31:51.354
Do you wanna know why I left, Holly?
Do you wanna know?

31:51.492 --> 31:53.119
Because you were never really mine.

31:53.695 --> 31:56.027
I mean, William was always there
between us.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.429
Yeah, but at least he was there,
which is more than I can say for you.

31:59.567 --> 32:02.502
Hey, you know what? You're right.
I was screwed up because I was using.

32:03.571 --> 32:06.438
But I loved you,
and that might have mattered

32:06.574 --> 32:09.509
if you hadn't been so hung up
being his mistress.

32:10.178 --> 32:13.944
I mean, do you know how much time
I have spent wondering why?

32:14.082 --> 32:17.051
Why him? All those years,
you lived on crumbs

32:17.185 --> 32:20.348
or whatever scraps he was
willing to throw your way.

32:20.488 --> 32:22.456
I mean, is that what
you thought you deserved,

32:22.590 --> 32:26.583
to be second-string
for a decade or two?

32:27.095 --> 32:29.723
You know why I'm here?
Because I care, Holly.

32:29.864 --> 32:31.764
I always have.

32:31.899 --> 32:33.867
Just walk away from this.

32:34.002 --> 32:37.563
You don't need William,
and you don't need the Walkers.

32:37.705 --> 32:40.731
You deserve more. You always have.

32:47.548 --> 32:50.346
It's okay. Ready?
Here we go. One, two...

32:50.485 --> 32:53.784
- I got him. I got him.
- Oh, good, I knew you would.

32:53.921 --> 32:57.084
Trish, I'm Dr. Katz. Sorry for the delay.
It's been a crazy day.

32:57.225 --> 33:00.285
- You know, she's in a lot of pain.
- Let's just do a quick check,

33:00.428 --> 33:02.020
and then we'll take care of it, okay?

33:02.163 --> 33:05.155
I told you. Everything's gonna be fine.

33:05.299 --> 33:06.891
- Oh, wow.
- "Wow," what?

33:07.035 --> 33:08.263
You're really progressing.

33:08.403 --> 33:10.769
- You're already at eight centimeters.
- Eight?

33:10.905 --> 33:13.203
Well, she was just at five
about a half an hour ago.

33:13.341 --> 33:15.673
- This baby really wants to be born.
- That can't be right.

33:15.810 --> 33:17.710
I'm sorry. You're too far along
for an epidural.

33:17.845 --> 33:20.109
- What?
- You're not gonna give her an epidural?

33:20.248 --> 33:22.682
- You're the one who was late.
- You gotta make an exception.

33:22.817 --> 33:25.012
At this point, an epidural
wouldn't be appropriate.

33:25.153 --> 33:27.178
- I'm sorry.
- No, no, that's not right.

33:27.321 --> 33:30.882
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I'll page Dr. Riley. I'll be right back.

33:31.025 --> 33:33.152
- I can't do this.
- You can do this. You can.

33:33.294 --> 33:35.694
You're already doing this.
You're at eight centimeters.

33:35.830 --> 33:38.060
Here, let's try the calm...

33:38.199 --> 33:40.929
I don't want that.
I was supposed to get the drugs. Please.

33:41.069 --> 33:42.366
Trish, another contraction...

33:42.503 --> 33:46.064
- I want the drugs they promised me.
- Trish, you can do it. You can do it.

33:46.207 --> 33:48.698
Call Robert. This is happening soon.
Breathe with me. Breathe.

33:48.843 --> 33:50.606
You got it. You're doing it. Okay, I'll be...

33:50.745 --> 33:54.806
Good, good, good.
Good job. You can do it.

33:58.753 --> 34:00.584
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. I got you disposable cameras,

34:00.722 --> 34:03.054
but the good ones,
with the flash and the zoom.

34:03.591 --> 34:06.560
Not that you probably want the zoom,
would you?

34:06.694 --> 34:08.321
- Is something happening?
- Oh, yes, yes.

34:08.463 --> 34:10.158
Everything is happening,
Robert isn't here,

34:10.297 --> 34:11.856
and nothing is going
the way we planned.

34:12.366 --> 34:14.994
Well, everything went exactly
according to plan with Paige.

34:15.136 --> 34:18.628
Joe was there every step of the way,
serenading me with his stupid guitar.

34:18.773 --> 34:21.036
At the time, I thought it was sweet.

34:21.175 --> 34:24.235
- Look at us. We got divorced, so...
- Sarah, I really need Robert to be here.

34:24.378 --> 34:26.005
- You think?
- I'll find him. I promise.

34:26.147 --> 34:27.170
- Okay.
Hang in.

34:28.516 --> 34:30.574
- I think I can hear Trish calling for you.
- Oh, no.

34:30.717 --> 34:33.312
She's not calling for me.
She's screaming in agony.

34:36.324 --> 34:38.621
- Where are you taking those?
- Roof. Senator's thirsty.

34:38.760 --> 34:42.196
No, that's French. Find some California.
Actually, no plastic bottles on the podium.

34:42.330 --> 34:45.322
Put it in a glass. Update.

34:45.466 --> 34:47.797
Where is he, Kevin?
She's almost eight centimeters.

34:47.935 --> 34:50.233
- Context please?
- She's moving faster than expected.

34:50.371 --> 34:52.464
Two more centimeters,
she starts to push.

34:52.607 --> 34:54.507
Speech is two pages.
How long does that give us?

34:54.641 --> 34:56.610
Not much. You better get him here,
now. I mean it.

34:59.580 --> 35:04.608
Good afternoon. Thank you all for coming,
particularly on such short notice.

35:10.158 --> 35:14.891
- Hello?
- David, it's Holly. I need to talk to you.

35:15.029 --> 35:16.087
Yeah, okay.

35:16.230 --> 35:20.223
About what you said earlier,
that you still care.

35:20.368 --> 35:22.802
- Do you mean that?
- Of course.

35:22.937 --> 35:26.998
<i>Okay. You were right.
I'm going to walk away.</i>

35:27.975 --> 35:29.875
I'll call you when it's done.

35:30.444 --> 35:32.173
Bye.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.383
- Holly.
- Hi.

35:46.961 --> 35:48.258
Is everything okay?

35:48.830 --> 35:51.230
It will be.
Do you mind if I come in?

35:51.365 --> 35:53.890
No, come in.

35:56.037 --> 35:57.868
As I look to the future,

35:58.005 --> 36:02.533
these challenges will be met
on the ground here in California,

36:02.677 --> 36:05.009
which is why I will not
be seeking re-election

36:05.146 --> 36:06.943
to the United States Senate.

36:07.081 --> 36:08.207
I am happy today to announce

36:08.349 --> 36:11.341
that I will be running
to be the next governor

36:11.485 --> 36:13.612
of the great state of California.

36:13.754 --> 36:14.812
Senator.

36:14.956 --> 36:16.446
Senator.
- John.

36:16.591 --> 36:18.957
Does this mean Governor Kern
is not seeking re-election?

36:19.093 --> 36:21.584
<i>As you know, Governor Kern
and I are longtime friends...</i>

36:21.729 --> 36:25.631
Sarah? Sarah, where's Robert?
She's starting to push.

36:25.766 --> 36:28.098
<i>- she will not be seeking
a second term.</i>

36:28.236 --> 36:31.569
Oh, no. Don't tell me that's live.

36:32.173 --> 36:33.401
No.

36:34.609 --> 36:38.807
- Kitty, I talked to Kevin.
- Oh, my God. I mean, I believed him.

36:38.946 --> 36:41.915
I actually believed
that he was going to get here.

36:42.049 --> 36:44.381
I mean, look at him.
This is what he does.

36:44.518 --> 36:46.486
He turns on the charm,
he does whatever he wants,

36:46.621 --> 36:49.146
and I fall for it. I keep thinking
that maybe he's gonna change.

36:49.290 --> 36:51.724
And you know what?
He's never gonna change.

36:53.294 --> 36:55.455
Did you know that he killed my article?

36:56.130 --> 36:58.121
- I did not know that.
- Yeah, well, he did.

36:58.266 --> 37:00.325
And you know what I did?

37:00.668 --> 37:01.726
I had sex with him.

37:01.869 --> 37:03.928
- Okay.
- Twice. Yeah, yeah.

37:04.071 --> 37:06.403
- That's how stupid I am.
- You're not stupid, Kitty.

37:06.540 --> 37:09.134
No, I am stupid. I married a politician,
and then I'm surprised

37:09.277 --> 37:10.437
when he lies to me?

37:10.578 --> 37:13.570
I mean, I'm the priority.
This baby is his priority.

37:13.714 --> 37:17.514
The family is his priority. No, no.
He has one priority, and there it is.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.348
And you know what?
This is over. It's done.

37:21.355 --> 37:23.755
There is no coming back after this.

37:23.891 --> 37:27.850
So, Sarah, if you could please call Kevin
and tell him that he can take his time.

37:27.995 --> 37:30.395
There's no rush.
And if you talk to Robert,

37:30.531 --> 37:32.260
just, I don't know,
tell him to kiss my ass.

37:36.337 --> 37:39.363
<i>So many issues
facing Californians today...</i>

37:44.145 --> 37:46.409
Kitty, what are you doing?

37:49.517 --> 37:52.714
- He's not coming.
- Well, there's still time.

37:52.853 --> 37:54.377
- No.
- He can still make it.

37:54.522 --> 37:56.615
No, he can't.

37:58.993 --> 38:02.224
I'm wondering how I'm
supposed to go back in there.

38:02.363 --> 38:06.493
I mean, Trish chose us both
as parents,

38:07.134 --> 38:09.295
and he's not showing up.

38:09.737 --> 38:11.796
Believe me, Trish is not
thinking about Robert,

38:11.939 --> 38:13.702
and neither should you be.

38:13.841 --> 38:16.435
You're about to meet your child.

38:16.577 --> 38:21.378
Kitty, when they put you in my arms,
and we looked at each other,

38:21.515 --> 38:26.009
and I looked in your big, brown eyes,
I didn't care that your father wasn't there.

38:26.754 --> 38:30.087
What mattered is that I had
that one, precious moment with you,

38:30.224 --> 38:33.250
and I will always have that.

38:34.862 --> 38:37.490
This is the beginning
of the most incredible relationship

38:37.631 --> 38:39.360
you will ever have.

38:40.067 --> 38:44.197
So get your big, brown eyes back in there
and go meet your baby.

38:45.673 --> 38:48.540
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

38:50.511 --> 38:53.173
Yeah. Yeah, I'm going.

38:53.314 --> 38:55.248
Well, I'm going with you.

38:55.383 --> 39:01.549
Mom, thank you so much
for being here.

39:03.491 --> 39:05.891
Where else would I be?

39:07.762 --> 39:08.956
Yeah.

39:11.198 --> 39:14.531
Well, neither party
has a monopoly on change,

39:14.668 --> 39:17.466
and I think California
needs a new direction,

39:17.905 --> 39:19.736
and I intend

39:19.874 --> 39:22.570
to be the one to make that happen.

39:22.710 --> 39:26.009
Senator.
Senator.

39:28.215 --> 39:29.443
Excuse me.

39:29.583 --> 39:33.075
As I think most of you know,
my wife and I are adopting a baby,

39:33.220 --> 39:35.017
and our birth mother is in labor,

39:35.156 --> 39:37.681
so I really should
be getting to the hospital.

39:37.825 --> 39:40.794
Thank you for coming.
I look forward to a great campaign.

39:40.928 --> 39:43.089
Can you give us details?

39:44.298 --> 39:46.323
- How much time?
- However long two centimeters is.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.301
- Okay, is the car downstairs?
- Yeah, it's waiting in the garage. Let's go.

39:51.038 --> 39:53.563
- Run every red light if you have to.
- Yeah, that's the plan.

39:53.707 --> 39:56.175
We're about to hit the garage.
I'll lose you. See you soon.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.904
- Is everything okay?
- Your baby's on the way, but we'll make it.

39:59.046 --> 40:01.674
Okay, Trish, you're ready
to start pushing.

40:01.816 --> 40:04.250
So when I tell you, you're gonna
bear down for a count of 10.

40:04.385 --> 40:07.479
Okay, squeeze as hard as you want.
Take a deep breath.

40:07.621 --> 40:09.111
Okay, Trish. Push.

40:09.256 --> 40:11.451
- Push, push, push.
- Push.

40:27.875 --> 40:30.503
Robert? What's wrong?

40:30.644 --> 40:32.771
Get Kitty on the phone.

41:56.931 --> 41:59.365
