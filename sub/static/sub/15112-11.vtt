WEBVTT

00:02.346 --> 00:05.746
I shouldn't be here.
This is not how it works.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.573
I understand. Let's
just talk this through,

00:08.574 --> 00:09.273
together.

00:10.004 --> 00:12.104
Tell me how this all started.

00:12.891 --> 00:16.357
I was... There, with Rex,

00:17.359 --> 00:19.179
at this carnival thing.

00:22.167 --> 00:24.573
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:24.574 --> 00:27.288
welcome to the annual
cops for kids event!

00:27.322 --> 00:29.123
Rex!

00:29.157 --> 00:30.791
Guys!

00:30.825 --> 00:31.876
Hi.

00:31.927 --> 00:33.260
How's it going, dad?

00:33.295 --> 00:34.178
Pretty good.

00:34.212 --> 00:35.496
Hi, Emma, how are you?

00:35.514 --> 00:36.881
Hello. No costume?

00:36.932 --> 00:38.382
No, I'm all done
with mine, but...

00:39.667 --> 00:41.135
Bird's still in his.

00:41.169 --> 00:42.386
You catch Rex?

00:42.437 --> 00:44.138
How you doing there?
But keep moving along.

00:44.172 --> 00:45.222
Keep moving.

00:45.273 --> 00:47.107
Five dollars for anybody
who shoots the...

00:47.142 --> 00:49.310
Okay, what are we
going on first?

00:49.344 --> 00:51.145
Can we bungee-jump?

00:51.179 --> 00:52.313
Please?

00:52.347 --> 00:54.148
He-he doesn't like heights.

00:54.182 --> 00:55.816
I don't like trusting my life

00:55.850 --> 00:57.485
to a rubber band.

00:57.519 --> 00:58.852
They're different, and it'll be
really, really fun.

00:58.870 --> 01:01.355
Please? Please? Can we, please?

01:04.575 --> 01:06.160
Sure.

01:10.248 --> 01:12.049
I'm sorry.
My fault.

01:12.083 --> 01:13.083
You okay?

01:13.134 --> 01:14.385
Yeah, I'm fine.
Thanks.

01:19.207 --> 01:20.474
You okay?

01:22.928 --> 01:24.812
Okay, who's going first?

01:27.766 --> 01:29.817
I guess that would be me.

01:29.851 --> 01:31.235
Dad, you sure?

01:31.269 --> 01:32.353
Do you want to go?

01:33.572 --> 01:34.655
All right.

01:39.661 --> 01:40.995
When we're ready,

01:41.029 --> 01:42.913
I'm gonna count backwards
from three,

01:42.948 --> 01:44.498
and then you jump.

01:44.533 --> 01:47.835
Let me just check all restraints.

01:47.869 --> 01:48.869
Dad?

01:50.338 --> 01:51.405
Dad?

01:52.407 --> 01:56.210
Sir, wait! I still need to...
Dad!

02:03.351 --> 02:04.969
Bad dream?

02:05.020 --> 02:06.854
Yeah.

02:09.640 --> 02:11.809
<i>And that's the last
thing you remember?</i>

02:11.860 --> 02:13.143
<i>Falling?</i>

02:13.194 --> 02:15.145
And what about when you woke up?

02:15.196 --> 02:19.216
At first, I was trying
to figure out what it meant,

02:19.251 --> 02:20.401
if it meant anything,

02:20.435 --> 02:22.286
and then as
the day went on,

02:22.320 --> 02:24.872
I... got so busy,
I didn't think about it any more.

02:26.708 --> 02:28.409
Tell me about your day.

02:29.794 --> 02:31.462
There.

02:31.496 --> 02:33.080
You can see
the heart beat.

02:35.000 --> 02:41.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:43.842 --> 02:46.260
Okay, that's yours.

02:49.097 --> 02:50.431
Thanks for coming.

02:50.465 --> 02:53.300
Of course.

02:53.318 --> 02:55.069
You all right?

02:55.103 --> 02:59.573
Yeah. I just wish
my own parents could see this.

03:00.909 --> 03:02.576
When was the last time
you talked to them?

03:02.611 --> 03:04.311
I texted her last night.

03:04.329 --> 03:06.480
She said that she was going
to bring some clothes over.

03:06.514 --> 03:07.498
Well, there you go.

03:08.867 --> 03:14.588
Maybe when she sees this...
I gotta go.

03:14.623 --> 03:15.822
I'll see you guys at dinner?

03:15.840 --> 03:16.840
All right.

03:16.875 --> 03:18.375
Yeah.
Thanks, Mr. Britten.

03:18.426 --> 03:20.511
Michael.

03:21.663 --> 03:23.013
Thanks, Michael.

03:23.048 --> 03:24.632
All right. Bye.

03:24.666 --> 03:25.766
Bye.

03:25.800 --> 03:26.934
<i>So this sicko from yesterday</i>

03:26.968 --> 03:29.169
walks right in here,
not a care in the world,

03:29.187 --> 03:30.554
right past the cameras.

03:30.605 --> 03:32.272
That's Petrowski.

03:32.307 --> 03:33.691
So while we're across town

03:33.725 --> 03:35.476
chasing him
for yesterday's murder,

03:35.510 --> 03:37.344
he shows up
and commits another one.

03:37.362 --> 03:39.480
Guess he wasn't kidding
in his journals.

03:39.514 --> 03:41.532
This guy is now
officially on a spree.

03:41.566 --> 03:42.533
Was it random?

03:42.567 --> 03:43.517
No.

03:43.535 --> 03:44.785
He knew the victim.

03:44.819 --> 03:47.020
I got a couple of co-workers say
they remember Petrowski

03:47.038 --> 03:48.989
from when he worked
on a contract three years ago,

03:49.023 --> 03:52.092
and he got on well with Mr.
Kalmack here.

03:52.127 --> 03:55.295
So yesterday, he commits
a murder at a bus stop

03:55.330 --> 03:56.797
for no apparent reason.

03:56.831 --> 04:00.467
And today, he shows up and stabs
a guy he got along with.

04:00.502 --> 04:02.035
He's out of his mind.

04:02.053 --> 04:03.754
Get used to it.
There's a lot of it around.

04:03.805 --> 04:05.422
He's hearing a voice

04:05.473 --> 04:06.757
telling him to kill people,

04:06.808 --> 04:08.709
and I'm hearing one telling us
to stop this guy.

04:08.727 --> 04:09.677
Quick.

04:09.711 --> 04:10.761
<i>And this suspect,</i>

04:10.812 --> 04:12.329
you still haven't found him yet?

04:12.364 --> 04:15.315
No. Not so far.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.684
<i>What about last night?</i>

04:16.718 --> 04:18.819
<i>Was there anything unusual</i>
<i>about your routine?</i>

04:18.853 --> 04:20.053
<i>No.</i>

04:20.071 --> 04:22.072
<i>I mean, as I lay down,</i>

04:22.107 --> 04:24.658
<i>I remembered</i>
<i>the carnival and the fall,</i>

04:24.693 --> 04:28.312
<i>and I wondered what exactly</i>
<i>would be waiting for me</i>

04:28.346 --> 04:30.531
<i>when I got back there.</i>

04:44.879 --> 04:46.630
<i>When I woke up, I realized</i>

04:46.681 --> 04:51.218
<i>that I-I hadn't gone back</i>
<i>at all.</i>

04:51.252 --> 04:53.137
And that's
never happened before.

04:53.188 --> 04:54.054
No.

04:54.088 --> 04:55.889
<i>No, I always switch.</i>

04:55.923 --> 04:59.393
<i>Hannah, Rex, Hannah, Rex.</i>
<i>It's-it's like clockwork.</i>

04:59.427 --> 05:01.712
So what does this all mean
to you?

05:01.746 --> 05:03.514
What does it mean?

05:03.548 --> 05:07.601
Doctor, it means you need
to figure out a way

05:07.619 --> 05:10.103
to get me back to my son.

05:10.121 --> 05:11.655
Now.

05:13.124 --> 05:14.908
<i>So tell me how this works.</i>

05:14.942 --> 05:16.960
<i>I'm awake with my
wife, and I close my eyes,</i>

05:16.995 --> 05:19.329
<i>I open them,</i>
<i>I'm awake with my son.</i>

05:19.380 --> 05:21.832
And this has been happening
since the accident?

05:24.052 --> 05:25.969
<i>So you begin working on one case</i>

05:26.004 --> 05:28.288
<i>here in reality,</i>
<i>and then suddenly</i>

05:28.306 --> 05:30.641
<i>you begin working another case</i>
<i>there in your dream.</i>

05:30.675 --> 05:33.727
<i>It all feels
completely real to me.</i>

05:33.762 --> 05:35.813
<i>You can't tell whether
you're awake or asleep</i>

05:35.847 --> 05:36.897
at this very moment?

05:36.931 --> 05:37.981
<i>Well, I can assure you,</i>

05:38.016 --> 05:39.850
Detective Britten,
this is not a dream.

05:39.901 --> 05:42.503
That's exactly
what the other shrink said.

05:42.798 --> 05:45.598
AWAKE
S01 Ep 11 - Say Hello To My Little Friend

05:46.007 --> 05:49.507
sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

05:52.451 --> 05:54.451
I understand how you feel.

05:54.502 --> 05:57.804
But you should know
that this is also

05:57.838 --> 05:59.389
actually a very positive sign
of progress.

05:59.423 --> 06:01.424
You know,
if you understood how I felt,

06:01.475 --> 06:03.643
you wouldn't use a word
like "progress."

06:03.678 --> 06:05.061
Something is not right.

06:05.096 --> 06:07.564
Something's just...

06:07.598 --> 06:10.317
Something's broke
or something's interrupted.

06:10.351 --> 06:12.102
Let's not look
for a complicated explanation

06:12.153 --> 06:14.487
when there's a simple one
readily available.

06:14.522 --> 06:16.439
The last time that you saw Rex,

06:16.490 --> 06:17.440
how did it end?

06:17.491 --> 06:19.326
You were standing
on this platform

06:19.360 --> 06:21.278
and then suddenly
you're falling and falling

06:21.329 --> 06:23.163
and boom... you wake up.

06:23.197 --> 06:26.917
Doesn't that sound like
the end of a dream to you?

06:26.951 --> 06:29.085
Falling is one of
the most common ways

06:29.120 --> 06:31.371
in which we transition
out of a dream state,

06:31.405 --> 06:33.673
and that transition
comes from your subconscious.

06:33.708 --> 06:34.925
It comes from you.

06:34.959 --> 06:37.294
This is not me telling you
that Rex is a dream.

06:37.345 --> 06:40.964
This is you
trying to tell yourself.

06:41.015 --> 06:42.915
Doesn't make any sense.

06:42.934 --> 06:45.185
Why?
Why would it suddenly stop now?

06:45.219 --> 06:46.686
Well, you got a lot going on,

06:46.721 --> 06:48.921
things that require
not only your attention,

06:48.940 --> 06:50.724
but your emotional investment.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.526
I-I-in addition
to this urgent case,

06:53.561 --> 06:56.279
you and your wife are
having a grandchild.

06:56.314 --> 06:58.198
There is a teenager
living in your house.

06:58.232 --> 07:01.701
Isn't it possible that this life
is starting to feel full

07:01.736 --> 07:04.988
and real in a way that is
finally beginning to help you

07:05.022 --> 07:07.290
let go of your son?

07:07.325 --> 07:08.792
No.

07:08.826 --> 07:10.443
This is... this is temporary.

07:10.461 --> 07:12.329
I can face that there's
something I'm not seeing.

07:12.380 --> 07:13.496
That's all.

07:13.547 --> 07:16.549
You are on the verge
of a breakthrough,

07:16.584 --> 07:19.886
and the biggest mistake
that you can make right now

07:19.920 --> 07:22.505
is to act as if it's a setback.

07:24.809 --> 07:27.677
I will not lose my son.

07:30.448 --> 07:34.634
Detective,

07:34.652 --> 07:38.088
you lost your son
six months ago.

07:45.979 --> 07:47.364
Hi.

07:47.415 --> 07:49.199
What are you doing in my car?

07:49.250 --> 07:51.368
Relax.

07:51.419 --> 07:53.319
Don't tell me "relax".
Show me your hands!

07:54.989 --> 07:55.755
Who are you?!

07:55.790 --> 07:56.873
I don't know.

07:56.924 --> 07:58.208
What does that mean?

07:58.259 --> 08:00.043
It means I don't know.

08:00.094 --> 08:01.678
Wait. I know you.

08:01.712 --> 08:02.879
I know you. I...

08:02.930 --> 08:04.497
I bumped
into you at-at...

08:04.532 --> 08:07.166
<i>That carnival thing.</i>

08:07.184 --> 08:10.437
That was... that was
the last time I saw Rex.

08:10.471 --> 08:12.004
Okay.

08:12.023 --> 08:13.973
Detective Britten?

08:21.198 --> 08:22.899
So glad I caught you.

08:22.950 --> 08:25.017
It was just sitting there
in the chair.

08:25.036 --> 08:27.787
I was getting ready
for my next patient.

08:27.822 --> 08:29.406
Everything okay?

08:29.457 --> 08:30.657
Yeah.

08:31.959 --> 08:33.076
Detective?

08:33.126 --> 08:35.193
I'm fine. Thanks.

08:42.807 --> 08:44.591
You don't look well, Detective.

08:46.002 --> 08:48.102
What is this? How did you...?

08:48.642 --> 08:51.811
Well, either I just leapt
through time and space

08:51.846 --> 08:53.563
or ding, ding, ding!

08:53.597 --> 08:54.981
You're hallucinating.

08:58.903 --> 09:00.437
Why am I seeing you?

09:00.488 --> 09:01.821
I don't know.

09:01.856 --> 09:03.189
Is it to do with Rex?

09:03.223 --> 09:04.991
Why can't I get back to Rex?

09:05.025 --> 09:05.692
I don't know.

09:05.726 --> 09:06.893
Stop saying that.

09:08.228 --> 09:10.063
Is it to do with the case?

09:10.097 --> 09:11.314
The Petrowski case?

09:11.348 --> 09:12.332
Okay.

09:12.366 --> 09:13.333
Okay?

09:13.367 --> 09:16.586
Listen, Detective, I'm
your imagination.

09:16.620 --> 09:19.189
I can only say
what you tell me to say.

09:21.092 --> 09:23.176
I tell Vega,

09:23.210 --> 09:25.011
and I catch
the Petrowski case,

09:25.045 --> 09:26.245
I go to sleep,

09:26.263 --> 09:29.516
bump into you there with Rex...
Right.

09:29.550 --> 09:32.268
...and, uh, I come back here,
there's a murder,

09:32.303 --> 09:36.723
and now I'm stuck here,
and then...

09:39.593 --> 09:41.694
Are you someone he works with?

09:41.729 --> 09:44.263
Are you a friend?

09:44.281 --> 09:48.201
<i>Why are we
reinterviewing these people?</i>

09:48.235 --> 09:50.102
They barely knew the guy.

09:50.121 --> 09:51.938
None of them have seen him
in three years.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.156
We should be out there

09:53.207 --> 09:54.290
trying to track
Petrowski down.

09:54.325 --> 09:55.742
We been out there
for a day and a half.

09:55.776 --> 09:57.293
We got nothing.

09:57.328 --> 09:58.711
We're missing something,
some detail.

09:59.797 --> 10:00.830
Like what?

10:06.470 --> 10:09.722
A short guy, kinda
strange-looking, a big chin

10:09.757 --> 10:11.624
pale blue eyes.

10:11.642 --> 10:13.476
Might have been
a friend of Petrowski's

10:13.511 --> 10:16.095
or just somebody you saw him
talking to one time here,

10:16.129 --> 10:17.597
or-or outside
the building, maybe.

10:17.631 --> 10:19.732
I don't remember
anybody like that.

10:19.767 --> 10:22.068
Petrowski's your
prototypical loner.

10:22.102 --> 10:24.070
He ate lunch by himself
in his cubicle.

10:24.104 --> 10:25.188
He didn't talk to us

10:25.239 --> 10:26.606
unless he was working
on our computers.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.307
Bruce is the only one
he <i>really</i> talked to,

10:28.325 --> 10:30.109
and you know,
he got stabbed to death for it.

10:30.143 --> 10:31.143
What about other employees...

10:31.162 --> 10:32.162
People who worked here
in the past?

10:32.196 --> 10:33.446
Somebody he might have
crossed paths with?

10:33.480 --> 10:37.200
I've done H.R. here for
the last 15 years.

10:37.251 --> 10:38.868
I don't recall ever having
an employee like that.

10:38.919 --> 10:40.820
Somebody else in the building,
perhaps.

10:40.838 --> 10:43.623
It doesn't ring a bell,
but who is this guy?

10:45.459 --> 10:48.294
He's just someone
we need to talk to.

10:50.381 --> 10:52.382
Big chin? Pale eyes?

10:52.433 --> 10:54.000
Where are you getting this?

10:55.686 --> 10:57.169
I can't say.

10:57.188 --> 10:58.605
You can't say?

10:58.639 --> 11:00.056
What does that even mean?

11:00.107 --> 11:03.359
I have a... source.
I'm not sure if he's reliable.

11:03.394 --> 11:04.894
Now you think I'm unreliable.

11:04.945 --> 11:06.729
That hurts.

11:06.780 --> 11:08.198
Can we go?

11:08.232 --> 11:10.733
<i>Petrowski's lived next to me</i>

11:10.784 --> 11:12.852
for, like, five years

11:12.870 --> 11:16.206
and I've never seen anyone like
that in the building.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.025
There's a short woman
that lives in one of the units.

11:19.043 --> 11:21.377
No, no. Maybe somebody
that delivered something

11:21.412 --> 11:25.164
to the apartment
or did some work there.

11:25.198 --> 11:26.499
I've never seen him with anyone.

11:26.533 --> 11:28.418
In the past month or so,
I'd see him in the hallway.

11:28.469 --> 11:29.702
He'd complain
about these headaches,

11:29.720 --> 11:32.422
but that was the most
I'd ever spoken to him.

11:32.473 --> 11:34.641
I mean you could tell
he wasn't well,

11:34.675 --> 11:36.342
but to go off
like this...

11:36.376 --> 11:38.344
Do people really do that?

11:38.378 --> 11:39.896
All the time.

11:39.930 --> 11:42.932
- Right, Detective?
- I'm sorry. I've got

11:42.983 --> 11:44.350
an appointment. Can I go?

11:44.384 --> 11:46.769
Yes.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.271
You'll call me
if you remember anything?

11:48.322 --> 11:50.023
Of course.

11:52.392 --> 11:53.860
<i>I know what this is.</i>

11:53.894 --> 11:55.662
It's the "little guy" thing
all over again.

11:55.696 --> 11:57.664
The what?
The homeless case.

11:57.698 --> 11:58.948
Where you were
obsessed

11:58.999 --> 12:00.416
looking for
the little guy.

12:00.451 --> 12:02.168
You were looking for me
before?

12:02.202 --> 12:05.588
Why are we looking for someone
no one has ever seen?

12:05.623 --> 12:08.124
Listen,
if you don't like it...

12:08.175 --> 12:10.093
No, if you don't tell me
about the source,

12:10.127 --> 12:12.295
then don't expect me
to follow...

12:24.725 --> 12:26.809
<i>I see a little silhouetto
of a man</i>

12:26.860 --> 12:30.313
<i>Scaramouche, Scaramouche,
will you do the fandango?</i>

12:30.364 --> 12:31.781
<i>thunderbolts and lightning,
very, very frightening me</i>

12:31.815 --> 12:34.367
You guys are killing me.
You're killing me.

12:34.401 --> 12:35.568
It's funny.

12:35.602 --> 12:38.871
This-this is a sacred song
from my childhood.

12:38.906 --> 12:40.106
You're destroying
the sacred song.

12:40.124 --> 12:41.491
- We're making you crazy.
- You're killing me.

12:41.542 --> 12:43.126
All right, Rex, again.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.210
Okay.
No, no.

12:44.244 --> 12:47.463
<i>Galileo, Galileo...
Galileo, Galileo...</i>

12:48.999 --> 12:50.633
Michael?

12:50.668 --> 12:51.668
You all right?

12:51.719 --> 12:54.170
Come on.

12:54.221 --> 12:55.638
Let's get you to the paramedics.

12:55.673 --> 12:57.390
- No.
- No, let me get the medics.

12:57.424 --> 12:59.342
I'm fine!
I've a... I've a bug

12:59.393 --> 13:01.427
or something.
I'm gonna go home.

13:01.461 --> 13:03.730
- Mike, are you sure?
- Here, take me home.

13:03.764 --> 13:05.815
I'll... I'll work from there.

13:09.903 --> 13:11.688
<i>How did it go today?</i>

13:11.739 --> 13:12.889
It was good.

13:12.923 --> 13:18.945
I mean, she cried, I cried.

13:18.979 --> 13:21.447
Just... you can tell
she wants me back.

13:21.481 --> 13:23.649
I mean, it's obviously
just dad right now.

13:23.667 --> 13:24.834
Have you talked to him?

13:24.868 --> 13:27.704
No. He won't even answer
my calls.

13:27.755 --> 13:31.007
I've never seen
him this bad.

13:34.878 --> 13:36.763
Michael, I wonder

13:36.797 --> 13:39.716
if it's time for you
to reach out to him again,

13:39.767 --> 13:41.634
father-to-father, you know?

13:41.668 --> 13:43.970
You can be so persuasive
when you try.

13:44.004 --> 13:45.221
Right, yeah.

13:45.272 --> 13:46.556
I mean, I'd be happy

13:46.607 --> 13:48.057
to talk to him.
I'll try.

13:48.108 --> 13:51.110
I don't know, Emma.

13:57.017 --> 13:58.468
What is it?

13:58.502 --> 14:02.205
I don't, uh... I
will speak to him,

14:02.239 --> 14:03.539
of course.

14:04.792 --> 14:06.909
You all right?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.463
Yeah. No, you know,
I'm not feeling very well.

14:10.497 --> 14:12.932
I think I'm gonna go lay down,

14:12.966 --> 14:15.251
- all right?
- Okay.

14:19.039 --> 14:21.157
You don't feel warm.

14:21.191 --> 14:23.676
Was it something you ate?

14:23.710 --> 14:26.562
No, it's my head.

14:26.597 --> 14:29.265
I'll be fine in the morning.

14:57.127 --> 14:59.278
Morning.

14:59.313 --> 15:02.248
What's going on?

15:02.266 --> 15:04.684
I don't understand.

15:04.718 --> 15:06.436
Why can't I get back to...?

15:18.031 --> 15:19.232
Yeah?

15:19.266 --> 15:21.067
I just got a tip
on Petrowski.

15:21.101 --> 15:23.619
Apparently, he crashed with some
guy he knew from the Internet.

15:23.654 --> 15:24.821
He bolted this morning.

15:24.872 --> 15:26.989
A tipster called it in
as soon as he realized

15:27.040 --> 15:28.374
that we were looking for him.

15:28.408 --> 15:29.642
What does his friend look like?

15:29.676 --> 15:33.579
I don't... I'm not doing
this again, Mike.

15:33.613 --> 15:36.382
All right. Text me the address.
I'll meet you there.

15:37.251 --> 15:38.468
Is this gonna be you?

15:38.502 --> 15:39.502
I hope so.

15:39.553 --> 15:41.637
You're not that fun
to hang out with.

15:41.672 --> 15:43.306
The feeling's mutual.

15:58.607 --> 16:02.158
I still can't belive.
I mean, murder?

16:02.607 --> 16:05.442
He slept right there.
That's, like, crazy.

16:05.477 --> 16:08.011
So, how do you know
Mr. Petrowski?

16:08.029 --> 16:10.698
I found him online.

16:10.732 --> 16:13.200
I needed a programmer
for my web site.

16:13.235 --> 16:15.536
I do real estate.

16:15.570 --> 16:17.137
He was really fast
and really cheap,

16:17.172 --> 16:19.290
and we got
to be friends.

16:19.324 --> 16:22.760
At least online.
Then yesterday he calls me up

16:22.794 --> 16:24.578
and says there's a problem
in his apartment.

16:24.629 --> 16:26.580
Is there a chance that
he could crash here tonight?

16:26.615 --> 16:28.549
And I'm, like... Bless you.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.651
You have cats?

16:30.685 --> 16:31.552
Two of them.

16:31.586 --> 16:33.721
You know, Roland was
allergic, too.

16:33.755 --> 16:35.389
He couldn't stop
sneezing.

16:35.423 --> 16:37.308
I actually thought maybe
that was the reason

16:37.342 --> 16:39.426
why he just bolted
without saying good-bye.

16:39.477 --> 16:41.228
And then I saw the news.

16:41.263 --> 16:43.430
Did he say anything
about where he was headed?

16:43.481 --> 16:45.749
No, nothing.

16:45.784 --> 16:47.735
Bless you.

16:47.769 --> 16:50.771
Did he... did he mention
anyone else? Anyone specific?

16:50.822 --> 16:53.090
No. Like who?

16:53.124 --> 16:54.525
Like, a short guy?

16:56.111 --> 17:00.281
Or, or anyone,
family, friends? Anyone?

17:00.332 --> 17:03.167
I wish I could help.
I really do. I'm sorry. No.

17:04.068 --> 17:05.269
Bless you.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.039
For before.

17:10.258 --> 17:11.625
We'd like to monitor

17:11.675 --> 17:13.210
your calls if you don't mind.

17:13.243 --> 17:14.295
Yes, please.

17:32.113 --> 17:34.198
What was on this table
last night?

17:34.232 --> 17:35.282
I don't know.

17:35.317 --> 17:36.984
Right here. There's something...

17:37.035 --> 17:39.737
Can you see droplets
around it?

17:39.771 --> 17:43.574
You must have sneezed around it.
It looks like a piece of paper.

17:43.608 --> 17:45.993
It was probably
my foreclosure listings.

17:46.044 --> 17:48.128
I had just gotten
a new batch in.

17:48.163 --> 17:51.382
And then I printed them out,
and I was actually...

17:51.416 --> 17:53.884
A list of vacant houses?

17:53.919 --> 17:54.752
Yeah.

17:54.786 --> 17:57.888
Can you get a copy, please?
Of course.

18:30.872 --> 18:33.040
LAPD! Open up!

18:35.844 --> 18:40.014
Stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop!
Hands up! Hands up now!

18:40.048 --> 18:41.432
Get on the ground!
Hands up!

18:41.466 --> 18:42.549
Turn around slowly!

18:42.600 --> 18:43.550
Keep your hands up!

18:49.274 --> 18:50.774
Get your head up!

18:50.809 --> 18:52.359
Keep still!

18:53.311 --> 18:54.561
In custody.

18:54.612 --> 18:56.063
- Nice move.
- Thanks.

18:56.114 --> 18:57.948
It's Muay Thai.
You should come.

18:59.484 --> 19:03.137
I'm sick. I don't know
what's wrong with me.

19:03.171 --> 19:05.139
I tried to see
a doctor to have them

19:05.173 --> 19:07.558
X-ray my head
or something,

19:07.592 --> 19:09.693
but they just sent me home.

19:09.711 --> 19:12.346
I keep having these thoughts.

19:12.380 --> 19:15.065
You don't know
what it's like to not be able

19:15.100 --> 19:16.784
to control
what's in your own head.

19:16.818 --> 19:18.802
When I saw the guy
at the bus stop,

19:18.837 --> 19:20.304
something just clicked.

19:20.338 --> 19:21.372
Thought all these people,

19:21.406 --> 19:24.675
maybe somebody would
stop me, but...

19:24.709 --> 19:26.260
Why Mr. Kalmack?

19:26.294 --> 19:29.096
He was always so nice to me.

19:29.147 --> 19:31.348
I don't have many friends.

19:31.382 --> 19:32.566
He would talk to me,

19:32.600 --> 19:35.419
maybe help explain
to me what to do.

19:35.453 --> 19:37.821
But I was talking to him,
I was looking at him,

19:37.856 --> 19:40.390
and I couldn't stop staring at
the letter opener on the desk.

19:40.408 --> 19:42.276
And it was like I just had to...

19:42.310 --> 19:44.978
I didn't even know what was
happening until he was...

19:45.013 --> 19:47.648
Part of it didn't
even feel real.

19:47.682 --> 19:49.500
It felt like I was dreaming.

19:51.453 --> 19:54.321
And then I woke up,
and he was dead.

19:54.355 --> 19:57.674
And then you ran.

19:57.709 --> 20:01.345
Where did you go to?

20:01.379 --> 20:03.413
I just drove around.

20:03.431 --> 20:05.799
My head was all messed up.

20:05.850 --> 20:07.418
Called Thompson,
but then I thought,

20:07.452 --> 20:08.952
"what if it
happened again?"

20:08.987 --> 20:10.871
"What if I did something
to him?" So, I..

20:10.905 --> 20:13.373
So I just got out of there.

20:13.408 --> 20:15.192
Did you talk to anyone?

20:15.226 --> 20:17.144
No.

20:17.178 --> 20:18.062
Why?

20:18.096 --> 20:20.697
Anyone you knew
from, uh... work?

20:20.732 --> 20:22.483
Maybe a short guy,
dark hair?

20:22.534 --> 20:24.735
- Detective...
- No. What is he talking about?

20:24.769 --> 20:27.604
Mr. Petrowski,
can you give us a minute?

20:33.611 --> 20:34.661
He already confessed!

20:34.712 --> 20:36.113
What the hell
are you doing?

20:36.131 --> 20:37.548
I just want
to make sure

20:37.582 --> 20:38.615
we're not missing
anything.

20:38.650 --> 20:40.017
You're compromising
the case.

20:40.051 --> 20:42.136
You plant the idea
that we're looking for some guy,

20:42.170 --> 20:44.471
whoever this guy is,
the attorney starts spinning,

20:44.506 --> 20:46.390
and all of a sudden
there's doubt.

20:46.424 --> 20:47.591
The whole thing falls apart.

20:47.625 --> 20:51.512
It is over. We got him.
He confessed, all right?!

20:54.766 --> 20:56.233
Go home.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.518
I'll finish
taking the statement.

21:05.910 --> 21:07.811
Hello?

21:10.165 --> 21:11.515
Are you here?

22:11.809 --> 22:14.428
No, no, no... Please.

22:18.149 --> 22:20.567
Rex!

22:20.602 --> 22:22.186
Rex!

22:34.465 --> 22:36.667
No, there's no reason
for you to be here.

22:36.701 --> 22:37.901
The case is closed.

22:37.919 --> 22:40.604
And yet here we are.

22:49.130 --> 22:50.950
Why am I still here?

22:51.630 --> 22:53.465
Why won't you let me
get back to my son?

22:53.496 --> 22:54.529
I told you.

22:54.563 --> 22:56.031
I know what you know.

22:56.065 --> 22:57.916
You thought it was
about the case, so...

22:57.950 --> 22:59.668
I thought it was
about the case.

22:59.702 --> 23:02.421
What is it about?

23:02.455 --> 23:04.339
Well, maybe it's not
about anything.

23:04.374 --> 23:07.275
Maybe Dr. Lee
was just right.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.177
- Maybe this is all there is.
- No.

23:09.212 --> 23:10.846
No.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.131
- I think so.
- I won't have that.

23:13.182 --> 23:15.684
- There's something...
- Michael?

23:17.854 --> 23:19.187
Who are you talking to?

23:19.222 --> 23:22.891
No one. I, I'm
talking to myself.

23:22.925 --> 23:25.593
Just working
something out.

23:25.611 --> 23:28.163
Y-you feeling all right?

23:28.197 --> 23:30.866
Yeah, yeah, it's that,
uh, you know,

23:30.900 --> 23:34.119
I had a tough couple of days.
Tough cases.

23:34.153 --> 23:36.571
It's complicated sometimes.

23:36.605 --> 23:37.956
Okay.

23:37.990 --> 23:41.410
You know you're meeting
Emma's father today.

23:41.444 --> 23:42.828
- No, I can't.
- Michael, please.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.796
- Listen, I can't. I...
- Michael...

23:44.831 --> 23:47.332
I feel like the longer
that this goes unresolved,

23:47.383 --> 23:49.334
the worse it gets
for everybody.

23:49.385 --> 23:50.802
Just talk to him.

23:50.837 --> 23:53.438
I feel like you
could really reach him.

23:58.344 --> 24:00.762
Yeah. Sure.

24:06.319 --> 24:09.154
Would you just leave me alone
for a few minutes?

24:09.188 --> 24:11.273
How could I leave you alone
if I'm you?

24:13.860 --> 24:15.861
Just stay here.

24:26.839 --> 24:28.924
As much as you and
your wife have seen fit

24:28.958 --> 24:31.593
to insert yourselves
into my family's business,

24:31.627 --> 24:34.679
this is between Emma,
her mother, and myself.

24:34.714 --> 24:36.465
Look, I have no desire
to stick my nose in

24:36.499 --> 24:37.883
where it doesn't belong.

24:37.934 --> 24:41.136
But you have to understand,
she's living at my house.

24:41.170 --> 24:44.055
So, I'm forced...

24:48.677 --> 24:51.029
So...

24:51.063 --> 24:55.367
I thought if we... you and I...
could talk face to face...

24:55.401 --> 24:57.119
My daughter has no idea

24:57.153 --> 24:59.204
what she's getting herself into.

24:59.238 --> 25:02.207
She's come to believe
that raising a baby

25:02.241 --> 25:04.626
will be no more
than a hiccup.

25:04.660 --> 25:07.662
Now, her mother and I
are trying to impress

25:07.696 --> 25:08.460
Michael, come here.

25:08.461 --> 25:09.748
Upon her exactly how isolating

25:09.799 --> 25:10.749
and difficult
this whole...

25:10.800 --> 25:12.134
Michael, I think
you need to see this.

25:12.168 --> 25:14.803
- Come over here.
- Are you listening to me?!

25:14.837 --> 25:17.722
- Over there... look!
- Absolutely.

25:17.757 --> 25:20.091
- You...
- You asked to see me.

25:20.143 --> 25:23.211
I-I-I-I'm not feeling,

25:23.229 --> 25:25.897
Michael, look at this!
You've got to see this.

25:25.932 --> 25:28.266
Why don't you say
what you have to say, hmm?

25:28.317 --> 25:30.986
- Michael! Come out here right now!
- Otherwise, let my wife and I...

25:31.020 --> 25:32.687
Handle things.

25:32.721 --> 25:33.939
Excuse me?!

25:35.107 --> 25:39.778
No, I, I'm sorry. I
didn't mean to, uh...

25:39.829 --> 25:41.029
Michael,
come here.

25:41.998 --> 25:43.782
Michael,
I see me.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.916
Through the window... that's me!

25:44.951 --> 25:46.117
I see me!

25:46.169 --> 25:48.403
Look!
Outside the window!

25:49.789 --> 25:50.839
That's me!

25:56.262 --> 25:58.513
What are you doing!?

25:58.548 --> 25:59.798
Get off the road!

26:03.135 --> 26:04.553
Stop!

26:16.765 --> 26:18.650
I told you to look!

26:18.701 --> 26:21.286
I told you,
and you wouldn't listen!

26:31.914 --> 26:33.999
<i>I see a little silhouetto
of a man</i>

26:34.050 --> 26:37.886
<i>Scaramouche, Scaramouche,
will you do the fandango?</i>

26:37.920 --> 26:40.132
<i>thunderbolt and lightning,
very, very frightening</i>

26:40.133 --> 26:41.156
You guys are killing me.

26:41.190 --> 26:43.391
- You're destroying a sacred song.
- We're making you crazy.

26:43.426 --> 26:44.726
- You're killing me!
- All right, Rex again!

26:44.760 --> 26:45.911
No, no!

26:45.945 --> 26:46.978
Okay.

26:47.013 --> 26:49.381
<i>Galileo, Galileo...
Galileo, Galileo...</i>

26:49.415 --> 26:50.982
Are you okay?!

26:51.017 --> 26:52.017
Are you all right?

26:55.321 --> 26:58.023
I saw someone I...
I need to talk to.

26:58.074 --> 26:59.474
But what were
you thinking?

26:59.492 --> 27:00.992
You almost
got yourself killed.

27:07.950 --> 27:08.917
Where you going?

27:08.951 --> 27:11.870
I'm pursuing a lead.

27:11.921 --> 27:15.123
You can't go! You
can't leave the accident!

27:16.959 --> 27:19.928
You can't leave
the scene of an accident!

27:23.299 --> 27:26.501
Little heavier
on the eyebrows.

27:26.519 --> 27:27.719
Like this?

27:27.770 --> 27:29.204
Yeah.

27:30.473 --> 27:32.357
Can you stretch it out?

27:32.391 --> 27:34.192
Make it longer?

27:37.146 --> 27:38.296
Stop!

27:38.331 --> 27:39.481
Stop. Stop.

27:40.933 --> 27:42.200
That's him.

27:45.854 --> 27:47.072
That's not bad.

27:47.106 --> 27:48.506
You said he was short?

27:48.541 --> 27:50.692
Like 5'5 ", 5'6".

27:50.710 --> 27:52.127
- Listen, can you...
- Michael, what's going on?

27:52.161 --> 27:53.545
We just got reports
of an accident

27:53.579 --> 27:54.796
- and you were on the scene?
- Not now, not now.

27:54.830 --> 27:55.997
Harper wants
to talk to you.

27:56.031 --> 27:57.299
Not now, Vega!

28:00.536 --> 28:01.886
Can we look for a match?

28:01.921 --> 28:03.421
I know who this is.

28:03.472 --> 28:04.706
What? He's in the system?

28:04.724 --> 28:07.726
This is Ed Hawkins
over at the West bureau.

28:07.760 --> 28:09.744
He's a cop?

28:09.779 --> 28:12.097
He's partnered
up with Isaiah Freeman.

28:12.131 --> 28:14.015
Bird?

28:14.049 --> 28:15.567
Is that your old partner?

28:17.770 --> 28:20.572
Michael, wait. What am I
supposed to tell Harper?

28:35.336 --> 28:36.954
So, they ship me off
to Western.

28:36.988 --> 28:38.539
We barely talk
for a couple of months,

28:38.590 --> 28:40.791
and then you need to meet me

28:40.825 --> 28:41.842
in ten minutes?

28:41.876 --> 28:44.611
I know, I'm sorry.
I just, uh...

28:46.664 --> 28:48.849
What do you make
of your new partner?

28:48.883 --> 28:52.669
Ed? Well, he seems
like good people, you know?

28:52.687 --> 28:55.338
He's sharp on the scene, has
your back in the office, why?

28:57.776 --> 28:59.810
I don't know...
I keep...

28:59.844 --> 29:01.812
I mean, I...
I got something going on.

29:01.846 --> 29:04.626
And, uh... I can't figure out...

29:04.627 --> 29:06.867
Bird, we got to go!

29:06.901 --> 29:08.852
Ed, hey.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.537
This Ed Hawkins.

29:10.572 --> 29:12.856
Michael. Michael Britten.

29:12.874 --> 29:13.957
Yeah, yeah, I know.

29:13.992 --> 29:15.375
Bird talks about you
all the time,

29:15.410 --> 29:17.411
mostly as a not so subtle way
of pointing out

29:17.462 --> 29:18.662
I'm slower than
his old partner.

29:18.696 --> 29:22.249
Did I see you this morning
on Beverly?

29:22.300 --> 29:23.550
Beverly?

29:23.585 --> 29:26.036
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

29:26.054 --> 29:27.087
My doc's right there.

29:27.138 --> 29:29.873
Anyway, good to see you.

29:29.891 --> 29:32.810
Wait. H-h-hang on.

29:32.844 --> 29:34.261
Let me ask you
something.

29:34.312 --> 29:37.564
I know this is going
to sound weird, but...

29:39.383 --> 29:40.934
Do we know each other?

29:40.985 --> 29:42.770
Somewhere, I mean,
I feel like...

29:42.821 --> 29:44.521
Were you working?

29:44.555 --> 29:47.908
Something... w-we...
Met somewhere?

29:52.063 --> 29:53.247
You don't remember?

29:53.281 --> 29:55.199
What?

29:56.785 --> 29:58.502
Your accident, Michael.

29:58.536 --> 30:01.171
I was one of the first
on the scene.

30:01.206 --> 30:04.291
I tried to help.

30:07.462 --> 30:10.964
Yeah... I don't remember much.

30:10.999 --> 30:12.683
Yeah, of course.

30:12.717 --> 30:13.884
I can imagine.

30:13.918 --> 30:17.420
I... sorry about your son.

30:20.475 --> 30:22.476
Give us a second.

30:27.482 --> 30:29.066
Mike, you all right?

30:32.387 --> 30:33.821
Yeah.

30:58.279 --> 31:02.266
<i>Is this the real life?</i>

31:02.300 --> 31:04.668
<i>Is this just fantasy?</i>

31:04.702 --> 31:07.821
<i>caught in a landslide</i>

31:07.856 --> 31:13.944
<i>no escape from reality
open your eyes</i>

31:13.978 --> 31:15.495
<i>look up to the skies...</i>

31:15.530 --> 31:18.198
<i>I see a little silhouetto
of a man</i>

31:18.249 --> 31:21.084
<i>Scaramouche, Scaramouche,
will you do the fandango?</i>

31:21.119 --> 31:23.086
<i>thunderbolt and lightning</i>

31:23.121 --> 31:24.621
<i>very, very frightening</i>
You're killing me.

31:24.655 --> 31:25.956
You're killing me.

31:25.990 --> 31:28.091
This-this is a sacred song

31:28.126 --> 31:29.960
from my childhood.

31:29.994 --> 31:31.929
<i>You're destroying</i>
<i>a sacred song.</i>

31:31.963 --> 31:34.631
<i>You're killing me.</i>

31:35.967 --> 31:37.935
<i>Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo...</i>

31:37.969 --> 31:40.020
All right.

31:40.054 --> 31:42.356
- If you want us to stop, just say...
- That'll shut you up.

31:42.390 --> 31:43.640
Mom, they train him
to drive like this.

31:43.674 --> 31:44.858
I know! Absolutely.

31:44.893 --> 31:47.361
Just watch the curves, okay?

31:50.131 --> 31:52.149
Michael, what's going on?

31:52.183 --> 31:54.201
I talked to Emma.
She was crying.

31:54.235 --> 31:56.069
She said that you said something
or did something to her father.

31:56.104 --> 31:58.188
Something about running out
into traffic?

31:59.908 --> 32:01.375
What are you doing on the floor?

32:04.045 --> 32:06.230
He's gone.

32:08.532 --> 32:10.667
He's really gone.

32:13.238 --> 32:14.638
He's gone.

32:14.672 --> 32:16.807
Michael.

32:16.841 --> 32:19.459
Everything's my fault.

32:19.494 --> 32:21.378
I did it.

32:21.396 --> 32:24.264
It's not your fault.

32:25.867 --> 32:27.517
I took our...

32:30.054 --> 32:33.140
...our boy...

32:35.476 --> 32:37.811
My little baby boy...

32:40.848 --> 32:42.833
...and I killed him.

32:42.867 --> 32:44.084
Look at me.

32:44.118 --> 32:45.502
Look at me.

32:45.536 --> 32:46.753
That was an accident.

32:46.788 --> 32:48.922
No, no, no.

32:48.957 --> 32:50.073
No.

32:50.091 --> 32:51.408
I don't...
I don't blame you.

32:51.426 --> 32:53.677
Well, you should.
You told me to slow down.

32:55.213 --> 32:57.431
Stop it.

33:00.351 --> 33:02.602
It... it...

33:04.939 --> 33:06.940
It's not okay.

33:11.646 --> 33:14.648
You were trying so hard
to stay strong for me.

33:18.353 --> 33:20.370
You don't have
to pretend any more.

33:24.592 --> 33:27.277
You don't have
to do that.

33:27.295 --> 33:29.629
We're in this together.

33:32.467 --> 33:34.468
It's just us.

33:51.853 --> 33:54.955
Morning.

34:01.553 --> 34:05.053
Michael, you have to understand
that I've always worried,

34:05.432 --> 34:06.932
that you were
throwing yourself

34:06.967 --> 34:08.717
back into the job
before you were ready.

34:08.768 --> 34:11.971
And I-I let you do that
because you seemed to need it,

34:12.005 --> 34:13.505
and that was
my mistake.

34:13.523 --> 34:17.777
But from where we sit now,
with you chasing imaginary leads

34:17.811 --> 34:19.395
and the department
looking at lawsuits

34:19.446 --> 34:21.697
and thousands of dollars
in property dam...

34:21.731 --> 34:23.514
Not to mention,
how do I explain

34:23.533 --> 34:26.068
that one of my officers
ran through traffic

34:26.119 --> 34:30.206
and then ran away from the scene
of the resulting accidents?

34:32.859 --> 34:34.460
I'm sorry.

34:34.494 --> 34:38.496
I... I thought I was
through the worst of it.

34:40.750 --> 34:42.083
I'm sorry.

34:42.135 --> 34:43.702
They're going to hand down
a suspension,

34:43.719 --> 34:46.639
pending a full investigation
into your actions.

34:46.672 --> 34:48.591
I think you need
to take this time

34:48.641 --> 34:52.377
to do what you weren't ready
or able to do before.

34:52.395 --> 34:55.231
Just let yourself process.

34:55.264 --> 34:57.233
Let yourself grieve.

34:57.267 --> 35:00.903
And then, we'll
see where we are.

35:12.749 --> 35:15.451
I killed my son, Captain.

35:15.502 --> 35:17.169
You can keep them.

35:27.814 --> 35:29.849
I'm sorry.

35:32.285 --> 35:36.989
I'm s... I'm so sorry.

35:44.364 --> 35:46.598
What are you doing here?

35:46.616 --> 35:48.467
What do you want
from me?

35:48.502 --> 35:49.652
I don't know.

35:49.703 --> 35:51.203
Look, I get it, okay?

35:51.238 --> 35:52.204
I remember.

35:52.239 --> 35:56.292
I-I... I give up.

35:56.326 --> 35:58.610
Can't you just go?
Can't you just...

35:58.628 --> 36:01.964
Can't you just leave me alone?

36:55.402 --> 36:58.637
<i>Thanks for agreeing to see me.</i>

36:58.672 --> 37:02.408
<i>And I... I apologize for</i>
<i>my behavior the other day.</i>

37:05.295 --> 37:08.130
The truth is that...

37:08.164 --> 37:13.619
I don't know if it's Emma
and the baby or... what.

37:13.653 --> 37:17.072
And I'm-I'm having
a lot more difficulty

37:17.123 --> 37:19.875
dealing with Rex's death
than I thought.

37:19.909 --> 37:21.760
And...

37:23.046 --> 37:27.416
I know I'm in no position
to tell you what to do.

37:27.450 --> 37:32.738
I just wanted to tell you
that losing a child is...

37:36.309 --> 37:41.263
...is the worst thing
that has ever happened to me.

37:41.298 --> 37:43.399
And-and to watch you

37:43.433 --> 37:46.485
voluntarily cut yourself
off from her...

37:49.389 --> 37:53.242
I would give anything...

37:53.276 --> 37:57.746
Anything for one more day...

37:57.781 --> 37:59.782
One more hour...

38:04.537 --> 38:10.826
...one more... One more
second with my boy.

38:10.860 --> 38:13.095
You know?

38:13.129 --> 38:16.298
And, uh, and...

38:16.349 --> 38:20.853
You can hate her or her decision
or the baby or us,

38:20.887 --> 38:23.188
but none of it matters.

38:23.223 --> 38:27.009
You just hold her tight...

38:27.043 --> 38:29.044
And you don't let her go.

38:33.316 --> 38:38.404
Because she... You never know.

38:54.220 --> 38:56.788
That was a good
joke on you, dad.

38:57.974 --> 39:00.726
It's my dad.

39:04.814 --> 39:06.398
Dad?

39:20.363 --> 39:21.864
Thank you.

39:23.917 --> 39:27.035
We don't know
what he's saying yet.

39:27.070 --> 39:29.521
Yeah, well, they're talking.
It's a start.

39:35.745 --> 39:38.547
Still kind of hard
to believe,

39:38.598 --> 39:41.600
No, it's just starting
to sink in.

40:01.738 --> 40:05.707
<i>Is this the real life?</i>

40:05.742 --> 40:08.093
<i>Is this just fantasy?</i>

40:08.128 --> 40:11.246
<i>caught in a landslide</i>

40:11.297 --> 40:16.051
<i>no escape from reality
open your eyes</i>

40:16.085 --> 40:18.921
<i>look up to the skies</i>

40:18.972 --> 40:21.640
<i>I see a little silhouetto
of a man</i>

40:21.674 --> 40:24.543
<i>Scaramouche, Scaramouche,
will you do the fandango?</i>

40:24.561 --> 40:26.545
<i>thunderbolt and lightning...</i>

40:26.563 --> 40:28.046
<i>You guys are killing me.</i>

40:28.064 --> 40:29.398
<i>You're killing me.</i>

40:29.432 --> 40:32.901
<i>This-this is a sacred song</i>
<i>from my childhood.</i>

40:32.936 --> 40:34.069
<i>You're destroying it.</i>

40:34.103 --> 40:36.488
All right.

40:36.523 --> 40:38.557
- If you want us to stop, just say...
- That'll shut you up.

40:38.575 --> 40:40.058
Mom, they trained him
to drive like this.

40:40.076 --> 40:41.059
I know. Absolutely.

40:41.077 --> 40:42.894
Just watch the curves, okay?

40:42.912 --> 40:43.895
Let's do it again.

40:43.913 --> 40:44.896
From the top?
Yeah.

40:44.914 --> 40:45.897
Have a heart.

40:45.915 --> 40:47.783
<i>Is this the real life?</i>

40:47.834 --> 40:50.285
<i>Is this just fantasy?</i>

40:50.336 --> 40:53.205
<i>caught in a landslide</i>

40:53.239 --> 40:55.907
<i>no escape from reality</i>

41:07.954 --> 41:09.137
Dad?

41:11.191 --> 41:13.192
Dad?

41:15.261 --> 41:17.362
Rex. Thank God!

41:19.399 --> 41:20.599
My boy.

41:20.617 --> 41:23.151
I thought I'd never
see you again.

41:23.203 --> 41:24.152
You okay?

41:24.204 --> 41:25.153
Yeah.

41:34.914 --> 41:36.114
You okay?

41:36.132 --> 41:37.115
Yeah.

41:37.133 --> 41:39.134
You okay, Mr. Britten?

41:50.179 --> 41:51.847
Yeah.

42:05.662 --> 42:07.529
<i>Dr. Evans?</i>

42:07.580 --> 42:09.698
<i>Detective Britten?</i>

42:09.749 --> 42:11.667
<i>Can I see you?</i>

42:11.701 --> 42:13.118
<i>Now?</i>

42:13.152 --> 42:14.586
<i>If possible.</i>

42:14.621 --> 42:16.338
What's going on?

42:16.372 --> 42:19.007
I need to talk something through
with someone, and...

42:19.042 --> 42:22.160
You're the only one
I can trust now.

42:22.178 --> 42:24.012
What is it?

42:26.733 --> 42:29.851
I was stuck, with Hannah.

42:29.886 --> 42:33.739
And I thought it was because
I had to... I don't know...

42:33.773 --> 42:35.941
Accept or understand.

42:35.975 --> 42:38.527
But it wasn't that at all.

42:38.561 --> 42:40.646
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.497
There was no accident.

42:42.532 --> 42:46.201
<i>That's what I had to understand.</i>

42:48.237 --> 42:50.072
They were trying to kill me.

42:50.106 --> 42:51.523
Who?

42:51.541 --> 42:55.861
<i>Detective Britten,
who was trying to kill you?</i>

42:55.895 --> 42:57.396
Another cop.

42:57.430 --> 42:59.414
Are you sure?

43:02.051 --> 43:04.202
Yeah.

43:04.220 --> 43:06.021
I'm sure.

43:06.055 --> 43:08.023
I'll meet you in half an hour.
