00:04.000 --> 00:05.720
<i>* In this world *</i>

00:05.800 --> 00:07.000
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

00:07.080 --> 00:10.800
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

00:10.880 --> 00:13.120
<i>* We'll make this right *</i>

00:13.200 --> 00:17.560
<i>* Find our way</i>
<i>Through this mystery *</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.120

00:19.200 --> 00:21.000

00:21.080 --> 00:22.400

00:22.480 --> 00:24.360

00:29.480 --> 00:30.840

00:30.920 --> 00:33.080
<i>* Together *</i>

00:33.160 --> 00:34.520

00:34.600 --> 00:37.920

00:38.000 --> 00:39.480

00:39.560 --> 00:41.200

00:41.280 --> 00:42.440

00:42.520 --> 00:45.320

00:45.400 --> 00:49.040
<i>* I just wanna be... *</i>

01:00.840 --> 01:03.280
I never thought
it would feel so strange...

01:04.599 --> 01:06.600
the water between my toes.

01:08.160 --> 01:09.680
Evie, I'm so sorry.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.200
I didn't mean for
this to happen.

01:12.280 --> 01:15.040
I was trying to protect you.
-I don't blame you.

01:17.120 --> 01:19.200
We both lied to each other.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.400
<i>Weilan has been
nothing but trouble</i>

01:31.480 --> 01:33.880
since she turned up
with her tail-snatching friend.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.760
We don't know the
dragon followed her,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.200
and despite what happened,
she was trying to help.

01:38.280 --> 01:41.000
She lied to the mermaid council,
Evie lost her tail,

01:41.080 --> 01:43.440
and the dragon is still out there
waiting for the next full moon.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.640
Ondina--
-You know I'm right.

01:45.720 --> 01:48.280
And if she does hang around till
the next full moon, what then?

01:48.360 --> 01:50.760
She comes up with another brainless
plan and we all lose our tails?

01:50.840 --> 01:53.720
Ondina, she's--
-No, Mimmi. It has to be said.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.680
The best thing would be
for Weilan to move on.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.120
You could have said something.

02:20.480 --> 02:23.520
Just act normal, like nothing happened.
-Got it.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.400
Hey, Evie!
It's good to see you back.

02:30.480 --> 02:32.160
I haven't been anywhere.

02:33.160 --> 02:36.880
No. She just means... It's
good to see you any, anytime.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.680
Yeah. Oh, hey, Evie.

02:38.760 --> 02:43.120
You know, I'm more than happy to look
after the shop for you after school...

02:43.200 --> 02:46.040
if you're still feeling a bit...
you know.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.120
A bit what?

02:48.200 --> 02:50.400
We just know how much
you loved being a mermaid.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.000
And, I mean, if it was me I'd--
- Yes.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.080
Losing my tail was a big deal.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.840
But it's done and there's
nothing anyone can do about it,

02:58.920 --> 03:01.920
so can we just drop it? Please.

03:04.880 --> 03:07.200
Hey, on the bright side, now you
can take a shower standing up.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.680
I hope the fish are not also
taking the day off.

03:54.240 --> 03:57.200
Uncle Shen, remember?
From market.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.400
Hi.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.240
No school today?

04:02.280 --> 04:04.640
Free period.
-Oh.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.360
How'd the puzzle box
work out for you?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.240
Did you solve it?

04:12.320 --> 04:13.920
Still a work in progress.

04:15.600 --> 04:18.279
Some problems not
so easy to solve.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.519
Some take time.

04:21.760 --> 04:23.600
Why do I not see you
at my shop lately?

04:24.480 --> 04:25.840
New stock arrive.

04:25.920 --> 04:28.400
I give discount to
regular customer.

04:28.480 --> 04:30.280
Yeah, well...

04:30.360 --> 04:33.080
I've been kind of busy
messing things up for everybody.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.640
Maybe you'll have better luck
with the fish.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.120
I'll see you around.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.840
Oh, my...
my eyesight not so good anymore.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.120
Can you help me tie the hook?

04:55.240 --> 04:56.960
Are you gonna sit here all day?

05:00.040 --> 05:02.240
You can't sulk forever.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.920
Evie must be feeling terrible.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.720
We should cheer her up.

05:06.800 --> 05:07.840
How?

05:07.920 --> 05:10.800
We should make her some Arctic
Marshmallow. She loves that.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.360
She doesn't need dessert.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.120
Well, what do you suggest?
We can't get her tail back.

05:17.160 --> 05:18.440
Maybe we can.

05:21.040 --> 05:22.520
Impossible.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.720
According to Weilan,
when a mermaid loses her tail

05:24.800 --> 05:26.640
to a water dragon,
it's gone forever.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.720
But Evie's only a half-mermaid.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.960
Remember the power of 50
moons spell we tried on Zac?

05:32.040 --> 05:34.160
That's how Evie got her powers
in the first place.

05:34.240 --> 05:35.920
There's no guarantee
that would work again.

05:36.000 --> 05:38.600
Even if there's a chance,
we should try. For Evie's sake.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.240
We should ask her first. When she
gets home from school this afternoon.

05:41.320 --> 05:43.040
No. We should do it now.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.560
We'll do a remote spell.
-Is that a good idea?

05:45.640 --> 05:47.040
Remote spells are
hard to pull off.

05:47.120 --> 05:49.200
The longer we wait,
the less chance we have.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.840
Imagine if you lost your tail.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.680
Wouldn't you do
anything to get it back?

05:58.720 --> 05:59.920
Are you sure this
is a good idea?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.880
We're giving Evie her tail back.
I'm not seeing a problem.

06:02.960 --> 06:04.640
What if she suddenly
gets a tail in public?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.920
She's at school. She won't
be anywhere near water!

06:07.000 --> 06:08.160
Let's go already.

06:23.320 --> 06:26.480
How will we know when it's worked?
-The potion will vanish.

06:27.480 --> 06:28.840
Here we go.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.560
<i>Process of osmosis</i>

06:33.120 --> 06:36.560
occurs when molecules,
in this case water,

06:36.640 --> 06:40.720
pass from a higher concentration
to a lower concentration

06:40.800 --> 06:43.640
across a partially
permeable membrane.

06:44.440 --> 06:47.480
Now, if you will turn to page--
- Oh!

06:48.720 --> 06:51.360
Everything all right there,
Evie?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.240
Sorry, Ms. Trumble.

06:56.520 --> 07:00.120
Turn to page 147...

07:01.160 --> 07:03.160
and look at the tables
comparing hypertonic...

07:03.240 --> 07:04.320
Are you okay?

07:04.400 --> 07:08.520
...isotonic and hypotonic solutions.
-Does it look like I'm okay?

07:09.520 --> 07:10.720
Is it working?

07:11.440 --> 07:12.440
I don't think so.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.080
Keep trying.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.920
Is this really the place
for aerobics, Evie?

07:31.000 --> 07:32.160
Sorry.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.040
Take your seat.

07:37.000 --> 07:39.080
It's starting to break up.

07:39.160 --> 07:40.360
You're losing it!

07:54.280 --> 07:56.440
I've tried. It's not working.

07:56.520 --> 07:58.680
Maybe it just needs a boost.

07:58.760 --> 08:00.200
Ondina, no!

08:07.120 --> 08:09.880
Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

08:09.960 --> 08:11.400
A bit tingly.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.800
Look! The potion's vanished.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.120
It must have worked.
- I guess.

08:17.200 --> 08:18.880
I knew we could do it.

08:41.919 --> 08:42.919
You like it?

08:44.960 --> 08:50.080
Rare blend, only grown
in the highlands of Fujian.

08:50.160 --> 08:51.160
It's lovely.

08:52.160 --> 08:54.000
Where did you get it?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.280
Local supermarket.

09:02.520 --> 09:04.520
Something on your mind?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.320
A problem shared...

09:15.400 --> 09:17.320
is a problem halved.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.000
I tried to fix something.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.480
A friend got hurt.

09:31.560 --> 09:35.800
If you were trying to help, I'm
sure your friend will forgive you.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.800
Not for this.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.360
Her life will never be the same.

09:44.400 --> 09:46.120
Never is a long time--
-No.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.360
You don't understand.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.800
I'd do anything to put things
back the way they were.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.080
But I can't.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.760
I want to tell her
that I'm so sorry...

10:03.120 --> 10:05.040
but I can't do that either.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.120
The best thing is for me
to just disappear.

10:11.840 --> 10:13.520
You mean run away.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.560
The school's on the other side
of the park.

10:21.640 --> 10:23.800
We'll wait till they have a
break and then talk to Evie then.

10:25.280 --> 10:26.960
What are you doing?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.280
Something's wrong.

10:28.760 --> 10:29.760
What?

10:29.840 --> 10:31.760
I can't get legs.

10:32.520 --> 10:33.520
Are you sure?

10:33.600 --> 10:35.680
I've been cooking myself
for the last five minutes.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.120
I'm boiled dry.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.040
What did you do to me?
-Me?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.920
I never told you to use your moon ring.
-You should have stopped me.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.240
Do something.
-Calm down. We'll sort this out.

10:45.920 --> 10:47.040
What about Evie?

10:48.520 --> 10:49.960
You swim back to the grotto.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.560
I'll go get Evie
and meet you there.

10:53.400 --> 10:56.240
A long time ago, in China...

10:56.320 --> 11:00.080
my family lend me
money to start shop.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.240
I was not very smart.

11:03.960 --> 11:06.640
Shop failed.

11:06.720 --> 11:10.000
I was so ashamed I run away.

11:12.400 --> 11:14.120
You look like you've done well.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.400
Well, I'm much smarter now.

11:18.320 --> 11:20.680
But I still regret running away.

11:22.560 --> 11:24.360
I'm not running away.

11:25.880 --> 11:28.040
It's more like a...

11:28.960 --> 11:30.760
strategic withdrawal.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.880
You cannot run from problem,
Weilan.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.800
It follows you, like shadow.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.360
You must turn and face it.

11:48.840 --> 11:52.080
Be brave. Be strong, like water.

11:53.360 --> 11:54.680
Water's not strong.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.400
Water is the most
powerful force on Earth.

12:02.840 --> 12:06.320
A river can wear away a rock.

12:06.400 --> 12:09.920
The waves can change
the shape of continents.

12:11.560 --> 12:16.360
And yet water has
grace and beauty, too.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.640
Like you.

12:22.680 --> 12:24.600
You've been in the sun too long,
Uncle Shen.

12:26.920 --> 12:29.240
Oh, perhaps you are right.

12:32.720 --> 12:36.080
You help me carry
back to my shop. Okay?

12:40.800 --> 12:42.360
What just happened back there?

12:42.440 --> 12:44.560
I have no idea.
-Evie, how do you feel?

12:44.640 --> 12:45.720
Why do you want to know?

12:45.800 --> 12:48.960
Ondina and I tried a long-distance spell
on you to try and get your tail back.

12:49.040 --> 12:52.040
Well, that explains the crazy
dance moves in class.

12:52.120 --> 12:54.840
You didn't think to ask me first?
-There was no time.

12:54.920 --> 12:56.840
Come on, let's see if it worked.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.360
I'm so sorry, Evie.

13:02.440 --> 13:04.280
I didn't mean to
embarrass you in class.

13:05.160 --> 13:07.960
If this works, all is forgiven.

13:10.280 --> 13:11.440
Ready?

13:12.720 --> 13:13.840
Okay.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.360
Thank you for trying.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.680
Yeah.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.640
Well, about that...

13:31.680 --> 13:34.000
there was a slight complication.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.440
Ow!

13:37.520 --> 13:39.360
Oh. Be careful!

13:39.440 --> 13:42.080
God. You're really heavy.

13:42.160 --> 13:43.160
Watch it!

13:44.840 --> 13:46.720
Ow. Ow, ow, ow!

13:51.360 --> 13:53.280
Don't worry, Ondina.
We are going to fix this.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.520
Like we fixed Evie?
- And whose idea was that?

13:56.600 --> 13:58.480
Call Rita.
She'll have an answer.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.280
What about Weilan?
-What about her?

14:00.360 --> 14:02.200
Well, she might be able to help.

14:02.280 --> 14:03.400
Are you crazy?

14:03.480 --> 14:06.240
I don't want to lose
my tail permanently!

14:06.320 --> 14:08.520
Rita's not answering.
Maybe she's in a meeting.

14:09.960 --> 14:12.360
Well, don't just stand there!
Go and look for her!

14:14.400 --> 14:16.080
Sorry.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.040
Go on. You can say it.

14:24.040 --> 14:25.480
What?

14:25.560 --> 14:27.720
I messed up, didn't I?

14:28.840 --> 14:29.880
We all make mistakes.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.640
You don't have to sugar-coat it,
Mimmi. I get it.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.480
It's my own fault.
-Well...

14:35.520 --> 14:38.200
now I guess you know
how Weilan feels.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.680
Oh, careful! Careful.

15:00.760 --> 15:02.920
Oh.
-What is it?

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
Oh.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.400
Very beautiful painting
of ancient myth.

15:07.480 --> 15:09.360
The Legend of Jiaolong.

15:12.960 --> 15:14.840
Ferocious dragon.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.000
See. People run from dragon.

15:19.840 --> 15:20.840
Like you.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.800
What do you mean?

15:24.880 --> 15:27.920
You have dragon in your mind.

15:28.960 --> 15:32.160
It is that what you fear,
inside.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.440
Even if you run away
from this place...

15:36.240 --> 15:37.320
trouble will follow.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.240
Are you sure you want to leave?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.240
I don't know.

15:42.320 --> 15:46.840
If you do decide to go, make
sure it is for right reason.

15:47.920 --> 15:51.160
Leave under a blue sky,
not a cloud.

15:52.480 --> 15:54.320
Here, I wanna give you this.

16:00.280 --> 16:01.280
What is it?

16:01.360 --> 16:03.000
Prawn crackers.

16:03.080 --> 16:06.320
No one should make up mind
on empty stomach.

16:07.480 --> 16:08.480
Thank you.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.240
Nice tail.
-I'm just giving it a stretch.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.160
The sandstone feels
good on my scales.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.400
What are you doing?

16:45.120 --> 16:47.880
You got your wish. I'm leaving.

16:49.280 --> 16:52.720
With any luck, the dragon will follow
me and your pod will be out of danger.

16:52.800 --> 16:53.960
Whoa!

16:56.760 --> 16:58.200
Are you stuck like that?

17:02.040 --> 17:05.400
Only because I was trying to fix your
mistake and get Evie her tail back.

17:05.480 --> 17:07.839
I told you, it's irreversible.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.480
That's why your spell backfired.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.520
I can probably
fix what happened.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.079
Like you fixed the dragon?

17:27.480 --> 17:28.520
Weilan?

17:29.320 --> 17:30.360
Weilan, stop!

17:44.040 --> 17:45.560
Okay.

17:45.640 --> 17:48.880
I admit that you did what
you did to try and help.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.520
That's not what you
said this morning.

17:52.600 --> 17:55.160
Maybe I've been a
bit harsh on you.

17:55.240 --> 17:57.760
But more than anything,
I just wanna protect the pod.

17:57.840 --> 17:58.920
So do I.

18:02.840 --> 18:05.440
I never meant for
Evie to get hurt.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.120
I wish I could
make things right.

18:11.240 --> 18:12.840
Not just getting her tail back.

18:14.240 --> 18:15.680
The dragon, too.

18:15.760 --> 18:17.840
Well, you're not gonna be
much help if you leave.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.480
If we're gonna to
defeat the dragon...

18:21.360 --> 18:23.400
we need to work together.

18:23.480 --> 18:24.800
All of us.

18:31.320 --> 18:32.760
Then we better
start by fixing you.

18:35.640 --> 18:38.160
The Golden Palm Technique should do it.
-Wait.

18:38.240 --> 18:39.560
Will it hurt?

18:39.640 --> 18:40.960
Not at all.

18:41.880 --> 18:43.720
But there's a chance
you'll turn into a crab.

18:43.800 --> 18:45.000
What?

18:45.720 --> 18:46.840
Kidding.

18:48.800 --> 18:50.800
Now show me your palm,
like this.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.360
And don't move.

19:13.560 --> 19:14.640
Did it work?

19:14.720 --> 19:15.960
You tell me.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.320
Let's hope we're not too late.

19:24.400 --> 19:25.560
What were you thinking?

19:28.320 --> 19:29.720
What happened?

19:30.400 --> 19:33.640
Weilan decided to show off some of
her eastern spell-breaking magic.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.880
Her cup of tea isn't bad either.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.960
Well, I'm just glad
everything's back to normal.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.480
Weilan.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.160
I'm sorry for missing
school today, Rita.

19:51.040 --> 19:54.080
I just had some personal stuff
I needed to sort through.

19:54.160 --> 19:56.600
Then I'll expect to see you
at school tomorrow?

19:56.680 --> 19:58.320
Wouldn't miss it.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.880
Good. Oh!

20:00.960 --> 20:02.840
Double homework,
due first thing.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.920
Evie... I'm so sorry.

20:19.760 --> 20:21.200
You know, it's strange.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.320
I feel like a weight
has lifted off my shoulders.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.160
This belongs to the pod.

20:41.360 --> 20:43.040
Don't get me wrong.

20:43.120 --> 20:47.840
Being a mermaid was a dream come
true and I'll miss having a tail.

20:49.520 --> 20:52.080
And we will miss having
you swim with us.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.240
Who says I can't swim with you?

20:55.240 --> 20:56.600
I'm a pretty good diver,
you know.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.080
The best.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.320
Is that so?

20:59.400 --> 21:03.000
And she's always been
fast in the water.

21:03.080 --> 21:05.040
Bet you can't beat us to Mako.

21:05.120 --> 21:06.280
Mmm.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.000
Two words...

21:08.080 --> 21:09.280
speed boat.

21:22.280 --> 21:24.040
Chosen your dive buddy yet?

21:25.240 --> 21:26.400
What's this?

21:27.280 --> 21:29.000
You got nothing else
planned for tonight?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.720
Well, I did have a few offers...

21:32.880 --> 21:35.360
but none quite as good as a
night dive with the old man.

21:36.880 --> 21:41.200
Permission to come aboard?
-Yeah. Permission granted!

22:33.440 --> 22:34.440
Hey.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.920
Weilan.
-What are you doing here?

22:37.840 --> 22:39.680
You don't mind if I
bunk with you, do you?

22:39.760 --> 22:42.440
Not at all.
You're always welcome.

22:43.120 --> 22:44.560
You don't snore, do you?

22:45.960 --> 22:47.120
Only when I sleep.

22:47.200 --> 22:48.760
Ha-ha!

22:50.320 --> 22:53.160
Good night, Weilan.
Good night, Ondina.

22:53.240 --> 22:54.760
Good night, Mimmi.

22:55.760 --> 22:56.840
Good night, Weilan.

22:58.600 --> 22:59.960
Good night.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.160
<i>* In this world *</i>

23:09.240 --> 23:10.720
<i>* We're all alone *</i>

23:10.800 --> 23:14.000
<i>* You know I love</i>
<i>My island home *</i>

23:14.080 --> 23:15.760

23:15.840 --> 23:21.080

23:29.280 --> 23:30.920

23:31.000 --> 23:32.400

23:32.480 --> 23:34.440
