00:01.055 --> 00:03.390
Previously on Smallville:

00:03.570 --> 00:06.506
- I think Lex has a piece of the spaceship.
- Are you sure?

00:06.674 --> 00:10.075
Roger Nixon. I'm a journalist,
and I'd like to write a story about you.

00:10.244 --> 00:13.008
- Whitney's going off to join the Marines.
- Really?

00:13.180 --> 00:14.238
If you're gonna take me on, son...

00:14.415 --> 00:17.350
...you're gonna have to bring your game
up to a whole different level.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.418
Just promise me Saturday night's
gonna be great.

00:19.587 --> 00:20.815
It'll be a night you won't forget.

00:20.988 --> 00:23.821
There's a whole lot more to your friend
Clark Kent than meets the eye.

00:23.991 --> 00:25.253
You'd better pray you're not wrong.

00:27.395 --> 00:29.056
You're not my enemy. You're my son.

00:31.899 --> 00:35.995
I believe the term is, "Cry havoc
and let slip the dogs of war."

00:40.341 --> 00:42.775
- Lana's there.
- Don't worry. I'm sure she's home by now.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.207
I'll tell the entire world about your son!

00:53.087 --> 00:55.112
Jonathan, look!

00:56.891 --> 00:58.290
Damn it!

00:59.260 --> 01:01.194
Help me!

01:03.597 --> 01:04.688
But he knows everything!

01:04.864 --> 01:07.766
- I will not let him destroy this family.
- No! Please!

01:08.436 --> 01:10.063
Jonathan!

01:12.139 --> 01:13.367
Clark!

01:15.943 --> 01:17.808
No!

01:18.412 --> 01:21.040
And now, the season premiere of Smallville.

02:23.043 --> 02:24.601
Lex!

02:25.880 --> 02:28.007
I'm your father!

02:34.388 --> 02:35.878
Son!

02:59.547 --> 03:00.809
Dad!

03:01.715 --> 03:04.946
Dad! No!

03:28.008 --> 03:30.374
Nixon!

03:40.654 --> 03:43.885
- Give me the camera!
- Get the hell away from me!

04:17.358 --> 04:18.791
Lana?

04:18.959 --> 04:20.358
Lana.

05:38.806 --> 05:41.036
I need help!

05:41.475 --> 05:43.500
I need a doctor here!

05:45.179 --> 05:47.841
- I need help. Now.
- What have we got?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.075
Pupils are responsive.

05:51.953 --> 05:54.251
Respiration appears normal.

05:54.689 --> 05:56.088
Got a good pulse.

05:56.257 --> 05:59.090
She's gonna be all right.
Can you tell me her name?

06:06.567 --> 06:08.899
Mom! Dad!

06:12.139 --> 06:14.733
Mom? Mom! Mom!

06:20.481 --> 06:23.177
- I'm gonna get you to a hospital.
- No, Clark, listen to me.

06:23.417 --> 06:25.647
- That reporter was in the cellar.
- Nixon?

06:25.820 --> 06:28.721
He videotaped the ship.
He's gonna expose your secret.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.448
- Your father chased him out into the storm.
- I've gotta find them.

06:33.427 --> 06:36.362
Mom? Where's the ship?

06:42.336 --> 06:47.273
There's swelling in his vertebrae, resulting
in partial loss of nerve control in his legs.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.671
His spleen is ruptured...

06:50.011 --> 06:52.809
...and he's sustained severe trauma
to his optic nerve.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.177
I want a medevac to Metropolis General.
I want a team of specialists.

06:56.350 --> 06:58.910
Your father's critical.
Moving him is not an option.

06:59.120 --> 07:01.850
- This isn't just any patient.
- I know who Lionel Luthor is.

07:02.023 --> 07:06.016
- I cannot give him any special treatment.
- That's not what I meant.

07:06.928 --> 07:10.364
He's my father.
Do everything you can for him.

07:14.969 --> 07:16.266
Lex.

07:17.004 --> 07:18.767
Lex.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.975
Yeah, Dad, I'm here.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.807
Don't worry.

07:25.980 --> 07:30.349
I'll fly in specialists from Metropolis
to personally supervise your case.

07:30.518 --> 07:32.645
I saw it...

07:32.820 --> 07:36.187
...in your eyes, son...

07:36.524 --> 07:38.754
...what you were thinking.

07:39.694 --> 07:44.290
Life would be so easy...

07:44.465 --> 07:47.593
...if I was out of your way.

07:51.305 --> 07:54.934
Dad, I'm sorry.

08:02.717 --> 08:04.582
Dad!

08:06.120 --> 08:08.554
- Dad!
- He hasn't been back to the house!

08:08.723 --> 08:10.486
Did you call the sheriff?
The hospital?

08:10.758 --> 08:13.249
- The phones are down.
- Dad grew up in tornado country.

08:13.427 --> 08:17.625
- The first thing he'd do is take shelter.
- I don't know if he was thinking straight.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.028
I've never seen your father that angry.

08:20.201 --> 08:22.863
He said he wasn't gonna let Nixon
destroy our family.

08:24.138 --> 08:25.730
Do you think he...?

08:26.040 --> 08:28.338
No, he would never do that.

08:43.424 --> 08:47.724
Oh, no! I won't say anything
about your son, I swear to God!

08:49.096 --> 08:51.587
Please! Don't kill me!

08:55.770 --> 08:57.465
Oh, God.

08:57.638 --> 09:01.301
- Oh, God. I thought you were gonna kill me.
- Yeah, you would think that.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.916
- Hey, Dorothy, back from Oz?
- Chloe.

09:13.087 --> 09:15.112
What are you doing?
Shouldn't you be in bed?

09:15.289 --> 09:18.486
I'm okay. The doctor says
it's just a mild concussion.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.158
Besides, a lot of people need this bed
a lot more than I do.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.661
Well, I'm just glad you're okay.
What happened?

09:24.832 --> 09:30.168
Well, I was driving back after dropping
Whitney off, when the wind picked up.

09:30.337 --> 09:35.536
This mailbox slammed against
my windshield, and I went off the road.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.735
That's when I saw the twisters.

09:39.513 --> 09:42.346
- Before I knew it, the truck was sucked up.
- God.

09:42.516 --> 09:47.146
You walked away with a small bump. That's
amazing, even by Smallville standards.

09:47.321 --> 09:50.119
- No, it's impossible.
- What?

09:50.291 --> 09:53.317
Nothing. The next thing I knew,
I was waking up here.

09:53.494 --> 09:57.897
So you clicked your heels, said, "There's
no place like home," and ended up here.

09:58.065 --> 10:00.329
Apparently Clark brought me in.

10:00.534 --> 10:03.697
- Clark?
- Yeah, have you seen him?

10:04.171 --> 10:07.834
No, not since he vanished from the dance.
I spent three hours looking for him.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.875
Guess the Spring Formal was
kind of a bust, huh?

10:11.312 --> 10:14.941
Yeah, well, at least now I know
where he disappeared to.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.646
If it's any consolation,
you guys looked great together.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.514
It's not, but thanks.

10:31.665 --> 10:33.030
Dad?

10:34.235 --> 10:38.001
Clark, I ran into your mother at the
hospital. She told me about your dad.

10:38.172 --> 10:41.539
I checked every acre of this place,
I gotta head for the woods.

10:43.444 --> 10:44.775
Clark.

10:45.579 --> 10:49.538
My father was injured in the twister.
He's in pretty bad shape.

10:49.917 --> 10:54.786
- Lex, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do?
- It's in the doctor's hands now.

10:55.923 --> 10:59.017
During the storm, my father was trapped
beneath a column.

10:59.193 --> 11:02.026
If I hadn't pulled him out,
he would've died.

11:02.563 --> 11:06.090
Before I did, I hesitated.

11:09.570 --> 11:13.472
I was thinking that maybe my life would
be better off if I just left him to die.

11:15.209 --> 11:17.473
- You saved him, that's the important part.
- No.

11:17.645 --> 11:22.139
My father won't see it that way.
Forgiveness is not in his emotional lexicon.

11:22.316 --> 11:25.581
If anything, he'll probably see
my saving him as a sign of weakness.

11:27.021 --> 11:28.784
What are you gonna do?

11:31.492 --> 11:33.722
Help my friend find his dad.

11:33.894 --> 11:35.657
You got another flashlight?

11:40.134 --> 11:42.830
- Dad!
- Mr. Kent!

11:44.104 --> 11:45.901
Mr. Kent!

11:49.877 --> 11:51.674
Dad!

12:15.069 --> 12:17.469
- Do you know whose car that is?
- No.

12:17.638 --> 12:20.801
I think we can cover more ground
if we split up.

12:21.008 --> 12:22.441
Yeah.

12:22.643 --> 12:25.669
- I'll meet you back here in a half-hour.
- Okay.

12:39.860 --> 12:41.327
Great.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.135
What are you doing?

12:49.303 --> 12:51.430
Looking for my cell phone.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.505
It's our only hope.

12:54.742 --> 12:58.838
The greatest story in human history, and
I'm not gonna get a chance to write it.

12:59.013 --> 13:01.106
Clark is not a story, he's my son.

13:01.282 --> 13:05.048
And I'm not gonna let you sabotage
his life while you make yourself famous.

13:05.219 --> 13:09.519
Is that why you chased me?
What were you planning on doing, Kent?

13:09.690 --> 13:12.386
Were you gonna bludgeon me
and bury me in a shallow grave?

13:12.559 --> 13:16.996
You were trespassing on my property,
and you tried to kill my son in that truck.

13:17.164 --> 13:23.569
You have the most amazing being on Earth
doing chores on your farm.

13:24.505 --> 13:29.169
Why are you hiding him? Tell the world
and let them see for themselves.

13:29.343 --> 13:32.039
I think I should leave that up to him
for when he's older.

13:32.212 --> 13:35.511
Well, when do you suppose that'll be?
Draft age? Drinking age?

13:35.683 --> 13:36.980
When he's ready.

13:37.151 --> 13:40.245
Why don't you stop playing the protector
and admit the truth.

13:40.421 --> 13:43.584
You kept him because you couldn't
have children of your own.

13:43.757 --> 13:47.955
We kept him because he is our son
and we love him.

13:48.128 --> 13:51.655
He's not your son, you deluded hick!

13:51.832 --> 13:54.027
He's not even human.

13:58.739 --> 14:01.503
You can kill me for saying this,
but you know I'm right.

14:01.675 --> 14:06.112
You're just a small man whose son's
destiny is too big for you to comprehend.

14:09.917 --> 14:13.785
Clark doesn't belong to you.
He belongs to the world.

14:21.729 --> 14:23.924
Hello? Lex?

14:24.932 --> 14:27.958
Nixon? Where the hell are you?

14:28.435 --> 14:31.666
You stupid son of a bitch!
I thought you wanted to get out of here!

14:31.839 --> 14:35.206
I did want out of here, till I realized
you were in bed with Lex Luthor.

14:35.376 --> 14:40.211
And I would rather rot down here than
watch the two of you destroy my son's life!

14:45.953 --> 14:48.444
Nixon, you still there?

14:48.622 --> 14:51.887
Just calling the fire department
so we can get a rescue team out here.

14:52.059 --> 14:55.551
No, you weren't.
I heard you trying to talk to Roger Nixon.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.789
He was at the farm today.
He was with my dad when the tornado hit.

14:58.966 --> 15:00.866
Clark, I didn't know Nixon was involved.

15:01.034 --> 15:04.470
Why should I believe you?
You already lied about knowing him once.

15:06.306 --> 15:09.173
That's the second time you've
hesitated today.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.811
Maybe what my dad said about you
is true.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.276
Clark, wait.

15:13.447 --> 15:16.974
- You're tired and upset.
- Don't try to turn this around on me!

15:17.151 --> 15:20.245
Are you really here to find my dad,
or to find Nixon?

15:21.121 --> 15:23.646
- Do you even have to ask?
- I don't have time for this.

15:23.824 --> 15:26.554
- I've gotta find my dad.
- Clark!

15:28.862 --> 15:30.659
Dad!

15:41.709 --> 15:43.438
I'll talk to the Red Cross people...

15:43.611 --> 15:46.512
...see if they have any new information
about your father.

15:46.681 --> 15:48.012
Clark.

15:49.117 --> 15:51.278
- Any luck?
- We looked all night.

15:51.452 --> 15:54.683
The search-and-rescue team
combed the farm but didn't find anything.

15:54.856 --> 15:58.121
I don't know what to do,
he's been missing for over 12 hours.

15:59.627 --> 16:01.925
You'll find him, Clark. I know it.

16:03.931 --> 16:05.398
Thanks.

16:05.967 --> 16:09.960
- I thought you'd be home recuperating.
- I wanted to help.

16:10.371 --> 16:14.774
You know, a lot of people helped me out
after the meteor shower. Meant a lot.

16:15.810 --> 16:17.971
I'm just glad you're okay.

16:20.481 --> 16:22.574
So how did you find me?

16:24.252 --> 16:27.312
I was lucky, I guess.
You were in a field next to the road.

16:27.488 --> 16:30.355
You must have been thrown free
from the truck.

16:31.926 --> 16:33.553
Is that really what happened?

16:34.328 --> 16:36.091
Yeah.

16:37.598 --> 16:39.361
Why?

16:39.534 --> 16:43.561
I just keep seeing something
that doesn't make any sense.

16:43.738 --> 16:47.174
The truck was caught up in the tornado,
and you...

16:47.475 --> 16:49.272
You just...

16:50.044 --> 16:51.443
Clark.

16:51.913 --> 16:53.744
No new word.

16:54.315 --> 16:57.978
I'd better get back to work.
You'll find him.

16:58.453 --> 17:03.083
I'm gonna stay and work the phones. If
anybody's seen or found him, they'll call in.

17:03.257 --> 17:06.385
They discovered an old couple
trapped in their garage this morning.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.256
So there's still hope.

17:08.596 --> 17:11.759
Dad's missing because of me.
I brought this upon us.

17:11.933 --> 17:16.131
You can't blame yourself.
You can't change who you are.

17:16.304 --> 17:19.272
As long as you live,
people will try to exploit you.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.465
Your father and I have tried to shelter you
as long as possible...

17:22.643 --> 17:24.941
...but one day we won't be there for you.

17:25.113 --> 17:27.877
You'll have to carry the burden
of your gifts on your own.

17:28.049 --> 17:30.176
- Don't say that, Mom.
- When your day comes...

17:30.351 --> 17:34.117
...I have no doubt in my heart
that you'll make us proud.

17:34.889 --> 17:36.914
Now go back out there.

17:46.000 --> 17:50.937
These old foundations, they mix lead in
with the cement for stability.

17:51.105 --> 17:55.064
- Afraid we're gonna die of lead poisoning?
- Clark can't see through lead.

17:57.044 --> 17:59.569
He can see through solid objects?

17:59.814 --> 18:02.749
Unbelievable. What else can he do?

18:03.518 --> 18:06.009
Do you have any idea
what I'd do with his abilities?

18:06.187 --> 18:09.679
The wealth, the power he
could amass, it's unimaginable.

18:09.857 --> 18:13.759
You are exactly the reason why
I keep his abilities a secret.

18:14.395 --> 18:16.920
If it wasn't me,
it would've been someone else.

18:17.098 --> 18:19.658
It was just a matter of time
before the story got out.

18:19.834 --> 18:22.826
- Yeah.
- The people have a right to know.

18:23.004 --> 18:26.371
Without any regard to the consequences
to my son.

18:27.975 --> 18:29.670
Mr. Kent...

18:30.178 --> 18:34.114
...since the beginning of time, people have
been looking at the stars, and wondering:

18:34.282 --> 18:36.182
"What's out there?"

18:37.418 --> 18:41.047
Clark is the answer
that they have been waiting for.

18:45.993 --> 18:49.588
- I think I know a way out of here.
- You gonna tell me what that is?

18:49.764 --> 18:52.130
You give me the tape of the ship,
and I will.

18:52.300 --> 18:54.165
That's not gonna happen.

18:54.335 --> 18:57.862
It's your life or your story.

18:58.039 --> 19:00.530
You've gotta decide which is
more important to you.

19:02.577 --> 19:03.942
I have.

19:29.303 --> 19:31.430
You gonna share your plan with me?

19:37.144 --> 19:40.170
Feel that. Go on.

19:44.552 --> 19:46.417
- The mortar's weaker here.
- Yeah.

19:46.587 --> 19:50.387
If we can get through here, I'm sure that
we can tunnel up to the surface.

20:01.335 --> 20:03.667
- Clark.
- What do you want?

20:04.705 --> 20:07.299
I should have come out
and told you the truth right away.

20:07.475 --> 20:10.535
I do know Roger Nixon.
I was just trying to protect you.

20:10.711 --> 20:12.736
Protect me from what?

20:14.615 --> 20:17.584
Before the tornado,
Nixon approached me.

20:17.752 --> 20:20.186
He offered to sell me information
about your family.

20:22.556 --> 20:25.252
- What kind of information?
- It doesn't matter. He's a liar.

20:25.426 --> 20:26.859
He'll do anything for a story.

20:27.061 --> 20:31.327
I warned him to stay away
from your family. When I saw his car, I...

20:31.499 --> 20:35.435
I realized he might have had something
to do with your father's disappearance.

20:36.804 --> 20:38.237
Why didn't you tell me before?

20:38.406 --> 20:40.966
I didn't want to alarm you
unless I knew for sure.

20:41.142 --> 20:44.168
You know, Lex, I don't know what
to believe anymore.

20:44.679 --> 20:46.112
Believe that I'm your friend.

20:48.349 --> 20:50.783
I've got something to show you.

20:56.757 --> 20:59.419
- What's that?
- It's a map.

20:59.961 --> 21:02.953
A cellular frequency grid, to be exact.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.291
I had my people look into it.

21:05.900 --> 21:09.802
Only one cell tower survived the storm,
meaning Nixon, and possibly your father...

21:09.971 --> 21:13.031
...had to be within a one-mile radius of
where we were last night.

21:13.207 --> 21:15.835
I don't know if it will help,
but it's worth a shot.

21:17.545 --> 21:20.343
- Mr. Kent!
- Dad!

21:20.514 --> 21:25.645
- Well, this is the edge of the grid.
- There are no structures marked on the map.

21:25.820 --> 21:27.447
Sorry, Clark.

21:27.722 --> 21:30.122
Wait, what's that?

21:30.725 --> 21:33.023
The twister must have dropped it here.

21:47.942 --> 21:50.206
- He's not in here.
- What are you, part bloodhound?

21:50.378 --> 21:53.404
Yeah. How do you know? Mr. Kent!

21:54.048 --> 21:55.948
Dad!

21:56.917 --> 21:58.111
Mr. Kent!

21:58.285 --> 22:00.776
- Did you hear that?
- It's the kids. Chloe! Pete!

22:00.955 --> 22:02.513
- Help!
- We're down here!

22:02.690 --> 22:06.456
They can't hear us! They can't.
I gotta keep on digging. Go!

22:06.727 --> 22:09.594
Roger, take it easy! It's not stable
down here.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.997
I got your legs!

22:17.004 --> 22:18.699
Hang on!

22:20.307 --> 22:21.934
Did you hear something?

22:31.552 --> 22:34.521
Come on, let's start again.

22:34.822 --> 22:38.280
- Mr. Kent?
- Dad!

23:04.119 --> 23:07.452
Here we see a terrifying example
of the tornado's fury.

23:07.622 --> 23:09.522
This truck was literally ripped apart.

23:10.091 --> 23:13.060
Incredibly, the young driver, Lana Lang,
survived.

23:13.228 --> 23:17.756
Reminding us that, even in the midst
of utter devastation, miracles can happen.

23:17.932 --> 23:20.662
It must have been awful for you.

23:21.102 --> 23:25.129
Yeah. I don't think I've ever been
that scared in my entire life.

23:25.306 --> 23:27.501
I'm glad you're all right.

23:29.277 --> 23:31.677
Thanks for all your help, Mrs. Kent.

23:31.880 --> 23:35.680
- I know it must be hard for you right now.
- I'm a saint.

23:36.951 --> 23:40.478
I just can't believe how familiar
all this feels.

23:40.655 --> 23:43.021
- The meteor shower?
- Yeah. God.

23:43.191 --> 23:46.854
- I remember it like it was yesterday.
- Yeah, me too.

23:47.028 --> 23:49.895
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to dredge up bad memories.

23:50.064 --> 23:52.464
It's okay. For so long it seemed
to define me.

23:52.634 --> 23:55.660
That fairy princess picture
on Time magazine.

23:56.671 --> 24:01.438
Well, if it makes you feel any better,
you made one wish come true that day.

24:01.609 --> 24:05.238
Jonathan and I were in Nell's buying
flowers, right before the meteor shower...

24:05.580 --> 24:08.811
...and you were sitting on the counter
with your wings and wand...

24:08.983 --> 24:12.578
...and you asked me if I wanted
to make a wish, so I did.

24:12.954 --> 24:16.048
And not long after that,
Clark came into our lives.

24:18.693 --> 24:21.184
I've never even told Clark that story.

24:24.966 --> 24:27.958
Clark is so lucky to have you and Mr. Kent
as parents.

24:29.003 --> 24:32.564
I've always been kind of envious.
You seem so open.

24:33.041 --> 24:36.807
I'm glad that you and Clark
have become close.

24:37.512 --> 24:39.480
Yeah. Me too.

24:44.919 --> 24:47.444
- Mr. Kent!
- Mr. Kent?

24:49.057 --> 24:50.581
Mr. Kent!

24:50.925 --> 24:52.517
Chloe?

24:53.294 --> 24:56.821
I've been wanting to apologize
for leaving you at the formal.

24:56.998 --> 25:00.559
Didn't I tell you that leaving in the
middle of a tornado to save a friend...

25:00.735 --> 25:02.532
...totally gets you off the hook?

25:02.704 --> 25:06.299
- Besides, I know you'd do the same for me.
- Oh, in a heartbeat.

25:06.474 --> 25:08.738
So how can I make it up to you?

25:08.910 --> 25:10.844
Actually, you know, I've been thinking.

25:11.012 --> 25:14.209
It's funny how a natural disaster
puts your life in perspective.

25:14.382 --> 25:17.545
But I think it might be better
if we just stay really good friends.

25:17.719 --> 25:20.517
Anything other than that
just gets too complicated.

25:24.959 --> 25:27.359
Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a good idea.

25:27.862 --> 25:29.762
- You do?
- Yeah.

25:30.465 --> 25:35.334
Yeah, our friendship is so important to me,
the last thing I want to do is screw it up.

25:36.404 --> 25:41.899
Good. Great. Perfect. I'm really glad
we got that straightened out.

25:42.944 --> 25:44.275
I'm gonna check over here.

25:44.445 --> 25:48.074
Okay, I'll catch up in a sec.
My feet are throbbing.

25:59.594 --> 26:01.357
Mr. Kent!

26:01.763 --> 26:03.526
- Hey.
- Hey.

26:04.666 --> 26:08.124
- What's up with the fake smile?
- Nothing.

26:09.270 --> 26:12.501
Clark and I just reaffirmed
that we're really good friends.

26:12.707 --> 26:14.504
And nothing else.

26:17.545 --> 26:21.140
- Pulled the "friends" card on you, huh?
- No, I did.

26:21.316 --> 26:23.307
Defense mechanism.

26:24.519 --> 26:26.453
Listen, Chloe...

26:27.288 --> 26:29.483
...it's okay to feel bummed out.

26:29.824 --> 26:32.224
Last night was supposed to be special...

26:32.961 --> 26:34.986
...and it got ruined.

26:35.930 --> 26:38.865
It was just so close to being perfect.

26:40.969 --> 26:45.702
Listen to me, I sound so pathetic.
A tornado hit, people are in real trouble...

26:45.873 --> 26:51.038
...and I'm upset because Clark
didn't fulfill my wish-fulfillment fantasy.

26:52.614 --> 26:55.139
You must think I'm an awful person.

26:55.416 --> 26:58.783
Yeah, you're a real monster.

26:59.053 --> 27:00.452
Come on.

27:06.327 --> 27:08.124
I can't breathe.

27:09.998 --> 27:13.263
The cave-in must have cut off
the air supply.

27:25.647 --> 27:29.413
Dying in a tomb, that's ironic.

27:30.151 --> 27:34.019
At least you've got a legacy
to leave behind.

27:35.490 --> 27:38.288
That's something to be proud of.

27:40.628 --> 27:43.358
First time Clark used his abilities...

27:45.767 --> 27:48.099
...he'd crawled under...

27:48.469 --> 27:52.371
...a big oak bed that my grandfather
had made, and I...

27:52.540 --> 27:57.170
I crawled underneath to try and get
him out, and then, all of a sudden, the...

27:57.345 --> 28:00.007
The frame just came up in the air.

28:02.116 --> 28:07.782
He was a toddler lifting, I don't know what
it was, 500 pounds over his head.

28:07.955 --> 28:09.217
What did you do?

28:09.390 --> 28:13.326
We decided to take him to a doctor
or a scientist.

28:14.262 --> 28:16.389
Somebody more equipped...

28:17.265 --> 28:19.460
...to understand than we were.

28:19.734 --> 28:26.037
But when we got in front of the office,
Martha said that if we left him there...

28:28.876 --> 28:32.334
...that they would want to keep him,
and we'd never see him again.

28:34.182 --> 28:36.173
So I took him home.

28:37.985 --> 28:40.852
Now, that may have been a mistake.

28:44.225 --> 28:47.319
But it was a mistake
I'd gladly make again.

28:51.733 --> 28:53.064
Time is of the essence.

28:53.234 --> 28:56.863
The spine may heal, but the optic nerve
will get worse if it goes untreated.

28:57.038 --> 29:00.872
- So surgery's the only option.
- No, I recommend against this.

29:01.042 --> 29:04.443
I say, let the patient's condition stabilize
before surgery is attempted.

29:05.113 --> 29:08.742
Yes, surgery's risky, but the alternative
could be worse.

29:10.752 --> 29:12.242
It's your decision.

29:13.020 --> 29:14.647
Do it.

29:15.189 --> 29:16.622
Fine.

29:19.527 --> 29:20.858
Where'd you get these maps?

29:21.028 --> 29:23.553
My mom borrowed them
from the county planner's office.

29:23.731 --> 29:25.961
They list every zoning change
going back to 1920.

29:26.134 --> 29:29.968
Look, the plans from 1988 show
an old church near Hobson's Pond.

29:30.138 --> 29:33.505
- I've never seen a church there.
- It was destroyed in the meteor shower.

29:33.775 --> 29:36.107
According to this,
there's a crypt in the basement.

29:36.277 --> 29:38.404
Your dad could have known about it.

29:39.247 --> 29:42.683
I was right there. The motor home must
have been concealing the entrance.

29:42.850 --> 29:46.581
Clark! You can't dig him out
on your own.

29:46.788 --> 29:51.248
Clark, Pete and I'll go into town. We'll get
a rescue team and meet you out there.

29:51.626 --> 29:52.854
Okay!

30:21.289 --> 30:23.314
- Dad!
- Clark!

30:23.491 --> 30:25.482
- Dad!
- Clark.

30:36.204 --> 30:38.695
Kent, what's happening to him?

30:38.873 --> 30:40.966
You gotta get him away
from the meteor rocks.

30:41.275 --> 30:43.300
They make him sick.

30:44.045 --> 30:46.536
Come on, get him out of here!

30:51.652 --> 30:53.449
What are you doing?

30:55.423 --> 30:58.358
I don't need the tape. I got all
the evidence I need right here.

30:58.526 --> 31:00.187
What are you doing?

31:01.395 --> 31:05.297
Nixon! You don't understand!

31:05.466 --> 31:06.865
The rocks...

31:07.435 --> 31:08.834
Clark...

31:25.319 --> 31:27.480
Oh, son of a...

31:31.792 --> 31:33.453
You're not...

31:33.728 --> 31:36.561
...taking my son!

31:56.083 --> 31:59.780
Like I said, the people have
a right to know.

32:00.288 --> 32:02.779
And unlike you, Mr. Kent...

32:02.957 --> 32:06.358
...I am willing to kill
for what I believe in.

32:22.877 --> 32:24.310
Clark.

32:26.881 --> 32:30.044
- Mr. Kent, are you okay?
- Yeah.

32:33.087 --> 32:34.679
Son.

32:34.855 --> 32:36.720
You've gotta help me.

32:44.065 --> 32:46.932
Clark, are you okay?

32:48.536 --> 32:50.265
I'll survive.

33:09.157 --> 33:11.921
Your dad's got a cracked rib,
but he'll be all right.

33:12.093 --> 33:14.584
Well, like you said, he's a survivor.

33:14.763 --> 33:17.732
And so are you. I never realized
how strong you were until today.

33:17.899 --> 33:19.628
Thanks, Clark, but I was terrified.

33:19.801 --> 33:22.770
You didn't show it.
You were like super mom.

33:23.004 --> 33:24.665
Dad, how you feeling?

33:24.839 --> 33:26.272
Thank you.

33:26.541 --> 33:29.442
Kind of like a house fell on me.
That's how I feel.

33:30.045 --> 33:35.142
- Dad, I'm glad that you didn't, you know...
- What, kill Nixon?

33:36.084 --> 33:40.919
I have to admit, it was the hardest thing I
ever did, took every fiber of my being.

33:41.089 --> 33:45.355
But I started thinking about you and what
your Mom and I've tried to teach you.

33:45.527 --> 33:48.860
I realized if I had done that,
Nixon would have won.

33:49.030 --> 33:51.089
It's a good thing Lex was there.

33:51.566 --> 33:52.965
Clark.

33:54.302 --> 33:58.830
Nixon told me that Lex offered
to pay him for information on us.

34:00.408 --> 34:02.808
Lex told me he warned Nixon
to stay away.

34:04.012 --> 34:06.606
One of them is lying, son.

34:09.717 --> 34:13.484
The question you need to ask yourself is,
which one tried to kill you...

34:13.655 --> 34:15.953
...and which one saved your life?

34:18.393 --> 34:21.089
If I have any more questions,
I'll give you a call.

34:21.262 --> 34:25.027
- Thanks. Mr. Kent.
- Lex.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.263
- Look...
- Lex...

34:34.109 --> 34:37.373
You saved my life,
and I want to say thank you.

34:43.752 --> 34:45.185
To a fresh start.

34:49.991 --> 34:51.652
Yeah.

35:54.489 --> 35:55.888
Clark.

35:58.026 --> 36:00.961
Your mom told me what happened
with you and Lana in the tornado.

36:01.129 --> 36:04.155
The only person who was there,
and I can't even share it with her.

36:04.332 --> 36:07.597
Well, son, I'm here, you can share it
with me if you want.

36:10.271 --> 36:12.933
Dad, I've survived a lot.

36:14.008 --> 36:15.805
Being inside that twister...

36:15.977 --> 36:18.275
I've never been so scared in my life.

36:18.446 --> 36:22.177
I couldn't see anything. Things were
bouncing off me. I didn't have any control.

36:23.017 --> 36:25.815
It could've been the wind,
but I moved toward the truck...

36:25.987 --> 36:28.956
...and it felt like I was willing myself
to do it.

36:32.627 --> 36:34.652
It felt like I was flying.

36:44.539 --> 36:46.029
Lex.

36:47.709 --> 36:49.734
Lex.

36:49.911 --> 36:51.242
Dad?

36:53.414 --> 36:54.972
Dad.

36:55.149 --> 36:56.741
How are you?

36:57.585 --> 36:59.485
The doctors won't tell me
what's going on.

36:59.654 --> 37:03.886
I know. I wanted to tell you myself.

37:04.659 --> 37:09.119
There's every chance
I'm gonna get back...

37:09.564 --> 37:11.532
...the full use of my legs.

37:12.967 --> 37:16.494
Well, that's great news. Isn't it?

37:16.671 --> 37:20.368
I need to say something to you.

37:20.875 --> 37:24.641
If I've acted ruthlessly...

37:24.812 --> 37:29.715
...it was because I knew my opponents
wouldn't hesitate to do the same.

37:30.051 --> 37:34.988
I know you've always seen us
as opponents.

37:35.690 --> 37:39.421
Lex, when I needed help...

37:42.263 --> 37:44.527
...you saved my life.

37:44.699 --> 37:48.066
And I thank you, son.

37:49.304 --> 37:50.862
Listen.

37:51.873 --> 37:55.809
I know you agreed to go right ahead...

37:55.977 --> 37:59.913
...right away, to operate.

38:00.515 --> 38:05.452
- I thought it best to take immediate action.
- I would have done the same thing.

38:05.620 --> 38:07.554
And we both...

38:10.458 --> 38:12.358
...would have been wrong.

38:15.697 --> 38:17.756
What are you saying?

38:21.569 --> 38:23.901
I'm blind.

38:24.072 --> 38:26.540
The operation failed.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.835
And that's not going to change.

38:29.010 --> 38:32.673
It would have been better
if you had not helped me.

38:32.847 --> 38:35.907
If you'd let me...

38:37.251 --> 38:39.014
...die.

38:43.091 --> 38:44.649
Lex?

38:49.063 --> 38:50.360
Lex.

38:56.037 --> 38:57.527
Lex.

39:02.844 --> 39:04.937
What are you doing, Clark?

39:05.780 --> 39:08.510
- Thinking.
- Looks like you're hiding.

39:10.018 --> 39:12.885
I just can't wait for things
to get back to normal.

39:13.621 --> 39:15.589
It won't.

39:16.457 --> 39:17.719
Why do you say that?

39:17.892 --> 39:20.759
Nell used to tell me that
after the meteor shower.

39:21.496 --> 39:23.191
But these events change you.

39:23.364 --> 39:27.664
Wipes out your illusions.
You discover things about yourself.

39:27.835 --> 39:29.928
What'd you discover?

39:30.338 --> 39:33.705
I've always had this sense
that I was going to die young.

39:33.908 --> 39:37.776
Maybe because of my parents.
Felt guilty I'd survived.

39:41.916 --> 39:44.817
When the tornado came,
I thought...

39:45.720 --> 39:49.315
...this was it, fate had finally found me.

39:51.292 --> 39:53.021
Then I saw you in the truck...

39:53.661 --> 39:57.722
...and you put your arms around me and
told me everything was going to be okay.

39:58.766 --> 40:00.700
I know, it sounds crazy.

40:00.868 --> 40:05.669
But I started to think of all the other
times you've been there to protect me.

40:05.873 --> 40:09.502
I thought, "Maybe there's more
to Clark Kent than meets the eye."

40:17.719 --> 40:21.155
You're right. It does sound crazy.

40:22.090 --> 40:24.217
There's nothing more to me
than what you see.

40:27.295 --> 40:28.660
Clark.

40:30.665 --> 40:33.065
You know you can tell me anything, right?

40:34.836 --> 40:38.328
I know, Lana.
But I wasn't in that truck.

40:38.673 --> 40:42.131
Then how did I survive?
It doesn't make any sense.

40:44.112 --> 40:46.444
Maybe you just weren't meant
to die young.

40:50.685 --> 40:52.585
Just remember:

40:53.621 --> 40:56.522
You can't hide out here forever.
