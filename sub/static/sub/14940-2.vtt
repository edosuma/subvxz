Previously on <i>Alphas...</i>

00:02.778 --> 00:04.712
- Gary?
- Nina, Gary's in trouble.

00:04.780 --> 00:07.250
He needs us.
They came.

00:07.317 --> 00:09.385
- I'm here for Gary, not you.
- Right.

00:09.452 --> 00:10.486
What happened between
the two of you?

00:10.553 --> 00:12.020
I woke up.

00:12.088 --> 00:13.255
Yeah, is that what you call
pushing everyone you meet?

00:13.323 --> 00:15.390
You need help.
I need to run the program.

00:15.458 --> 00:17.793
I decide what happens
to the Alphas we locate,

00:17.860 --> 00:21.130
I approve of the assignments,
and with no interference.

00:21.781 --> 00:23.495
Gary and I just found something
that is huge.

00:23.520 --> 00:24.853
This is from the Civil War.

00:24.878 --> 00:26.063
There's Stanton Parish.

00:26.088 --> 00:28.781
Out there somewhere,
planning God knows what.

00:30.210 --> 00:33.712
Let's get to work.

What's wrong?

03:22.426 --> 03:25.797
Nothing.

03:25.865 --> 03:28.904
It's just, uh...

03:28.972 --> 03:33.012
now that your dad's back...

03:33.080 --> 03:34.615
when he asked me
to check in on you,

03:34.683 --> 03:36.486
I'm not sure this
is what he had in mind.

03:36.554 --> 03:40.092
Oh, I don't know.

03:40.161 --> 03:42.597
He did grow up in the '60s.

03:42.665 --> 03:48.442
Dani, when we tell him,
things are bound to get weird.

03:48.510 --> 03:50.846
And then, of course,
there's Nina.

03:50.913 --> 03:52.916
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Mm.

03:52.984 --> 03:55.856
No ex-girlfriends in the bed.

03:58.462 --> 04:02.668
I like this.

04:02.736 --> 04:06.408
I don't want it to change.

04:06.476 --> 04:09.314
Well...

04:09.381 --> 04:13.320
well, we don't tell him.

04:13.388 --> 04:15.223
- Send the files over.
- All right.

04:15.291 --> 04:16.591
They're gonna want
a pros and cons...

04:16.660 --> 04:17.827
Details, just got 'em.

04:17.894 --> 04:19.329
Morning, Dr. Rosen.

04:19.398 --> 04:21.433
- Uh, good morning...
- It's my chow!

04:21.500 --> 04:24.104
- Whoever you are.
- No one is allowed to use it!

04:24.172 --> 04:25.473
- Where's my pudding?
- It's only my stuff!

04:25.541 --> 04:26.809
That's a rule!
No excuses!

04:26.876 --> 04:28.411
- Agent Bell, listen!
- No, don't touch me.

04:28.478 --> 04:29.745
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Get away from me!

04:29.813 --> 04:32.480
What is going--
easy, easy. Easy, partner.

04:32.548 --> 04:34.116
- Gary, Gary...
- Gary, please.

04:34.184 --> 04:36.019
Gary, you know better than
to shove people like that.

04:36.087 --> 04:37.455
What happened?
They provoked me!

04:37.523 --> 04:39.591
I'll show you! Look.
Where's my pudding?

04:39.659 --> 04:40.959
Hadn't even expired--
with this crap!

04:41.027 --> 04:42.128
Gary.

04:42.197 --> 04:43.130
- None of this is mine!
- Gary, Gary.

04:43.198 --> 04:44.533
It's all theirs!

04:44.601 --> 04:45.702
Well, maybe he didn't
understand

04:45.770 --> 04:47.209
how important your shelf
is to you.

04:47.277 --> 04:48.479
You want to start arguing
with office mates--

04:48.547 --> 04:49.482
No, no!
I shouldn't have to explain.

04:49.550 --> 04:50.819
My name was on there!

04:50.887 --> 04:52.022
Well, we'll put your name
back, all right?

04:52.089 --> 04:53.392
No, no!
It's not all right!

04:53.459 --> 04:54.460
'Cause even if
it's just my pudding,

04:54.528 --> 04:55.695
it's still stealing.

04:55.763 --> 04:56.797
It's stealing!
He should go to jail!

04:56.865 --> 04:57.864
Gary.

04:57.932 --> 04:59.263
- Bill, arrest him.
- Okay--

04:59.331 --> 05:01.427
- Don't provoke me!
- Don't touch him.

05:01.495 --> 05:04.730
All right?
Don't touch him.

05:07.572 --> 05:11.048
Dr. Rosen!
I'm slamming my door!

05:13.826 --> 05:17.101
- Hey!
- Hey.

05:17.169 --> 05:18.840
Suck up all those
little dust mites yet?

05:18.908 --> 05:20.478
Hey, I just cleaned there.

05:20.546 --> 05:22.248
No, you know what, actually?
It's dead skin.

05:22.316 --> 05:24.452
Whose, I have no idea.

05:24.519 --> 05:27.588
The really nasty stuff
was on the phone.

05:27.656 --> 05:29.523
Just breathing through it.

05:29.591 --> 05:32.295
Fake it till you make it.

05:34.365 --> 05:35.866
She in yet?

05:35.934 --> 05:37.801
You know Nina isn't the most
prompt person in the world.

05:37.869 --> 05:39.203
Hmm.

05:39.271 --> 05:41.540
It's gonna be weird,
isn't it?

05:41.608 --> 05:42.775
You two working here together?

05:42.842 --> 05:44.644
No, no.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.582
We're...we're cool.

05:46.650 --> 05:49.319
Really? 'Cause
your pupils just dilated.

05:49.387 --> 05:52.189
And your heart rate is up.

05:52.257 --> 05:53.791
Good to have you back, Rach.

05:55.794 --> 05:59.734
Gotta love that
government start paperwork.

05:59.802 --> 06:01.238
You know, to be honest,

06:01.306 --> 06:04.210
I did enjoy putting
"mental institution"

06:04.277 --> 06:08.548
under "previous address."

06:08.616 --> 06:10.584
I see we have
quite a few new faces here.

06:10.652 --> 06:12.819
Analysts mostly...

06:12.887 --> 06:14.722
here to support you
and your team.

06:14.790 --> 06:16.324
Yeah, which,
loosely translated,

06:16.392 --> 06:17.392
means "keeping an eye on me."

06:17.460 --> 06:18.628
You're an indicted felon

06:18.695 --> 06:20.830
who was on
a court-ordered psych hold.

06:20.898 --> 06:23.634
Had to call in a lot of favors
to get you out.

06:23.702 --> 06:27.439
Well, let's not pretend it was
an act of benevolence, Nathan.

06:27.507 --> 06:30.277
You need me.
I'm not your enemy, Lee.

06:30.344 --> 06:31.745
If you're gonna accomplish
anything,

06:31.813 --> 06:34.151
we're gonna have
to do this together.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.223
Fair enough.

06:37.291 --> 06:40.226
Perhaps you can tell me
something about this.

06:44.869 --> 06:47.874
TNK America crash.
Uh...

06:47.942 --> 06:50.111
Cargo train exploded outside
of Jersey City.

06:50.179 --> 06:53.548
Destroying 9 tons
of high-sulfur coal

06:53.616 --> 06:56.652
13 tons
of pressure-treated lumber,

06:56.720 --> 06:58.755
and 30 cars
of copper wire

06:58.822 --> 07:00.790
and municipal-grade
electrical equipment.

07:00.858 --> 07:03.526
Yeah, it set the Con Ed
maintenance schedule back

07:03.594 --> 07:04.727
six months.

07:04.795 --> 07:07.029
What's on your mind?

07:07.096 --> 07:09.197
With every loss,
there is often a beneficiary.

07:09.265 --> 07:12.834
I'm just wondering...
who benefited from this.

07:12.902 --> 07:15.103
The FBI have any suspects?

07:15.170 --> 07:16.604
It was an accident.

07:16.672 --> 07:18.906
I saw the preliminary
D.O.T. report.

07:18.974 --> 07:20.974
There was no evidence
of a device.

07:21.042 --> 07:23.176
That's exactly how
Stanton Parish operates.

07:23.244 --> 07:25.378
In the shadows.

07:25.446 --> 07:28.247
His signature is often
no signature at all.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.248
Is that what this is about?

07:30.316 --> 07:34.953
Your 200-year-old
Alpha bogeyman?

07:35.020 --> 07:37.922
You advocate bloodshed
and war.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.058
Nothing that you or I
can do to stop that.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.794
It's inevitable.
You'll forgive me if I try.

07:45.263 --> 07:50.467
Well, I wish he were,
as you intimate, a delusion.

07:50.535 --> 07:52.102
But he is very real, Nathan,

07:52.169 --> 07:54.470
and, I believe,
extremely dangerous.

07:54.537 --> 07:58.772
So, uh, we gotta keyword hit.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.976
NYPD. We have an assault
and possible abduction.

08:03.044 --> 08:04.444
A whole lotta weirdness.

08:04.512 --> 08:05.745
Good to have you back, Lee.

08:05.813 --> 08:07.213
May I see that, please?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.348
Why don't you just
get settled in,

08:09.415 --> 08:10.582
and Hicks and I'll
take care of it.

08:10.650 --> 08:14.286
I'm settled in fine.
May I see that?

08:24.496 --> 08:27.598
He stepped here...
and here.

08:30.505 --> 08:33.006
Then there.

08:33.075 --> 08:34.107
Whatever.
Doc, listen.

08:34.176 --> 08:35.642
Witness statements say

08:35.710 --> 08:37.277
that whoever attacked this guy,
no one actually saw him.

08:37.345 --> 08:39.479
So what's up with Gary-vision?
Eat my pudding at 2:30.

08:39.547 --> 08:41.714
But I can't,
because it was stolen.

08:41.782 --> 08:43.049
Gary, please,
we need your help.

08:43.116 --> 08:44.283
Yeah, I know.

08:44.350 --> 08:46.584
Ok, I found a blur.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.186
We're looking
for someone blurry.

08:49.254 --> 08:51.088
And, Bill!
It's not Gary-vision.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.390
It's electromagnetic perception.
Right.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.525
Here.

08:56.593 --> 09:00.200
- How fast is that footage?
- Four frames a second, or five.

09:00.268 --> 09:01.508
They should
upgrade, though.

09:01.576 --> 09:03.611
Bill, this guy is moving...

09:03.678 --> 09:06.012
almost ten times
normal human speed.

09:06.080 --> 09:08.882
All the while,
dragging a grown man.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.784
He must be burning at least
10,000 calories an hour.

09:11.852 --> 09:13.452
My pudding had calories.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.920
Now I'm never gonna get
to taste them.

09:14.987 --> 09:16.988
Wait.

09:17.056 --> 09:18.990
I found the same blur.

09:19.058 --> 09:20.825
Here. Broadway and 9th.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.160
There.
He's crossing the street.

09:22.227 --> 09:24.195
Not--Dr. Rosen,
he's not using the walk signal.

09:24.263 --> 09:25.996
That's reckless.

09:26.063 --> 09:28.230
That's five blocks
from the kidnapping.

09:28.298 --> 09:29.865
Bill, let me speak
with Rachel, please.

09:29.933 --> 09:30.933
Right.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.835
- Gary--
- Hello.

09:33.902 --> 09:35.036
Rachel, it's safe to say,

09:35.104 --> 09:36.469
we're looking for an Alpha

09:36.536 --> 09:38.604
with an extraordinarily
accelerated metabolism,

09:38.672 --> 09:41.607
which means his body could
literally be eating itself.

09:41.674 --> 09:43.308
- Okay.
- So, uh,

09:43.376 --> 09:45.477
you should be
on alert for an odor.

09:45.544 --> 09:48.480
Something like, um,
bad breath or rotten meat.

09:48.548 --> 09:50.582
So, basically,
he was emitting ketones?

09:50.649 --> 09:54.218
You could have just
said that, Dr. Rosen.

09:54.285 --> 09:57.687
I smell cheese and pasta,

09:57.755 --> 09:59.822
sour wine and...

10:01.758 --> 10:04.459
lilac perfume.

10:04.527 --> 10:06.194
New girlfriend?

10:06.262 --> 10:08.963
I accidentally bought
the wrong soap.

10:09.031 --> 10:10.397
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:10.465 --> 10:11.632
You did?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.934
That's definitely
the wrong soap, Hicks.

10:14.002 --> 10:15.835
- It's this way, you guys.
- Yes.

10:15.903 --> 10:18.771
It's definitely in here--
the scent.

10:18.839 --> 10:21.007
Man, this place stinks.
You smell that?

10:21.075 --> 10:23.443
I don't know, Doc,
it seems like some sort of...

10:23.510 --> 10:26.345
fish, uh, processing plant
or something.

10:26.412 --> 10:28.480
You know, I think we need
to call in tactical.

10:28.548 --> 10:29.748
Bill, this is a kidnapping.

10:29.816 --> 10:32.482
We do not have time
to wait for a TAC-team.

10:32.550 --> 10:34.443
Every second counts.

10:34.511 --> 10:36.641
Kind of lost the scent.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.143
All I smell is fish.

10:38.210 --> 10:44.012
- We got this, Rachel. Back out.
- Okay.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.111
Hey, check this out.

10:46.179 --> 10:49.109
It's wiped down.
Somebody must have grabbed it.

10:49.177 --> 10:51.077
Look at this.
Don't touch that.

10:51.145 --> 10:53.112
Remember, you don't want
to put prints on those.

10:53.180 --> 10:56.748
All right, we'll, uh--
plan "B," then.

10:56.816 --> 10:58.816
Why don't you do
your thing and...

10:58.884 --> 11:00.651
rip this puppy off.
Watch this.

11:00.719 --> 11:03.852
Brains over brawn.
Works every time.

11:03.920 --> 11:06.020
Oh, oh, ouch!

11:06.088 --> 11:08.022
You okay?

11:08.089 --> 11:09.856
What the hell?

11:12.009 --> 11:13.770
I traced the prints
on the screwdriver

11:13.795 --> 11:15.259
to Eli Aquino.

11:15.482 --> 11:17.746
One arrest, a couple years ago,
for stealing cars in Queens.

11:17.835 --> 11:20.961
Now this guy was chased
for four blocks

11:21.025 --> 11:22.255
by a motorcycle cop.

11:22.323 --> 11:24.451
Was clocked
at 45 miles an hour, on foot.

11:24.519 --> 11:27.012
Yeah, which brought him
to the attention of the D.O.D.,

11:27.079 --> 11:29.875
who decided to forgo
the constitutional niceties

11:29.943 --> 11:32.768
of due process, and directly
sent him to Building Seven.

11:32.836 --> 11:35.162
He was out as soon as Scipio
and his guys opened the doors.

11:35.229 --> 11:37.425
Yeah, good.
That was a bad place.

11:37.492 --> 11:38.889
Hey, Binghamton sent
Eli's medical records.

11:38.954 --> 11:40.184
They should be in the drop box.

11:40.252 --> 11:42.318
Rachel, I thought
you had taken a break.

11:42.386 --> 11:43.653
I've seen dead bodies before.

11:43.721 --> 11:45.318
No, that's not what
we talked about...

11:45.386 --> 11:49.477
I believe Rachel
can decide for herself.

11:49.545 --> 11:51.873
Gary, can you get
that drop box?

11:51.938 --> 11:53.536
Yep.

11:54.770 --> 11:57.102
Oh, yes.
Just as I suspected.

11:57.169 --> 12:01.111
Eli has an enlarged
suprachiasmatic nucleus.

12:01.179 --> 12:02.279
This is the region
of the brain

12:02.347 --> 12:03.781
that controls
our circadian rhythms,

12:03.848 --> 12:06.584
and this accounts
for his enhanced speed.

12:06.651 --> 12:08.186
But it comes
at quite a high price.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.187
Gary, would you go back
to the picture of--

12:10.255 --> 12:11.689
yes, this one.

12:11.757 --> 12:14.893
Now this is Eli when he
was arrested two years ago.

12:14.961 --> 12:16.327
And there should be
another photo.

12:17.863 --> 12:21.298
Yes. And this is his
high school yearbook picture.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.133
Four years ago.
Four years ago?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.668
That would make him 22.

12:24.736 --> 12:26.269
But he looks so much older now.

12:26.337 --> 12:28.037
That's because he is,
Rachel.

12:28.105 --> 12:30.406
He ages at
an ever-accelerating rate.

12:30.474 --> 12:32.408
It's a condition similar
to progeria,

12:32.476 --> 12:33.709
but it's much more acute.

12:33.777 --> 12:35.411
Okay, so what happened.

12:35.478 --> 12:36.879
I mean, getting older doesn't
turn you into a murderer.

12:36.946 --> 12:38.447
This guy have "kill a guy
with a screwdriver"

12:38.514 --> 12:39.848
on his bucket list?

12:39.916 --> 12:40.949
He doesn't have
a history of violence.

12:41.017 --> 12:42.617
As far as we know, Bill.

12:42.685 --> 12:44.086
Gary, would you check and see

12:44.154 --> 12:46.021
if there have been any similar
crimes since the breakout?

12:46.089 --> 12:48.557
Bill, I think we should bring
Mrs.,uh, what's her name?

12:48.624 --> 12:49.891
Already on it.

12:49.958 --> 12:51.625
Have them bringing up
the victim's wife.

12:51.693 --> 12:53.927
So I'll see if she's got
a connection to Eli.

12:53.995 --> 12:55.262
In the meantime,

12:55.329 --> 12:57.397
Rachel and Hicks can check out
incident reports.

12:57.465 --> 12:58.898
Lot of work to do, folks.
Let's go.

13:10.544 --> 13:12.076
Hey, how's it going?

13:12.144 --> 13:13.443
Miss anything exciting?

13:13.511 --> 13:16.440
Uh...uh, no.

13:16.507 --> 13:19.307
Just the, uh,
usual craziness.

13:19.375 --> 13:23.411
Glad I slept in.

13:23.479 --> 13:25.847
No! Don't even think about it!

13:25.914 --> 13:29.116
Government jerk-ass!
Gary, take it easy, relax.

13:29.184 --> 13:30.417
No, that's what he is.
A jerk-ass.

13:30.485 --> 13:32.151
It's good.
He fears me now.

13:32.219 --> 13:33.952
Oh, hey, Nina.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.488
You're late.
We start at 9:00 a.m.

13:36.555 --> 13:38.556
So nice to be back.

13:38.624 --> 13:40.524
Oh, Hicks,
I can't find anyone else

13:40.592 --> 13:42.326
who was killed
with a screwdriver.

13:42.393 --> 13:43.426
I found some other people

13:43.493 --> 13:44.893
who were killed
with wrenches, though.

13:44.961 --> 13:46.995
Yeah, screwdriver's
not the important part, Gary.

13:47.062 --> 13:48.729
Uh, Eli's fast.

13:48.797 --> 13:50.364
Speed.
We're looking for speed.

13:50.431 --> 13:51.998
Oh, well, why didn't you
tell me that in the first place?

13:52.066 --> 13:53.199
And Hicks...

13:53.267 --> 13:54.467
You need to respond
to your texts.

13:54.534 --> 13:55.901
You've got six texts.

13:55.969 --> 13:58.237
If someone sends you one,
then you should respond

13:58.305 --> 13:59.572
to those,
when someone sends you--

13:59.639 --> 14:00.473
Okay, Gary, I'll take care
of that. Thanks.

14:00.540 --> 14:03.942
He never answers his texts.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.676
What did you have
for breakfast?

14:05.744 --> 14:07.545
You had something good.
It says...

14:07.612 --> 14:08.879
It says,
"this morning was yummy."

14:08.947 --> 14:10.848
Did you have pancakes?
Gary, that stuff is private.

14:10.915 --> 14:12.316
We've talked about that,
haven't we?

14:12.384 --> 14:13.817
Oh, it's
Dr. Rosen's daughter.

14:13.885 --> 14:15.018
You had pancakes
with Dani Rosen?

14:15.086 --> 14:16.787
Gary, I swear to you, listen.

14:16.855 --> 14:18.889
Now you tell anyone about this,
I will kill you.

14:18.956 --> 14:21.758
No, you wouldn't kill me.
That'd be premeditated homicide.

14:21.826 --> 14:23.159
You'd go to jail.

14:23.227 --> 14:27.029
You'd go to jail.

14:31.734 --> 14:34.369
Oh, what've you got there?

14:34.437 --> 14:35.871
Too much.

14:35.938 --> 14:36.904
What do you think?

14:36.972 --> 14:39.407
What is it? Van Gogh?

14:39.475 --> 14:42.176
That's an amazing print.

14:42.244 --> 14:44.112
Print.

14:44.179 --> 14:46.047
Right.

14:46.115 --> 14:48.383
Nina.
What? Nin--

14:48.451 --> 14:49.818
Don't start, okay?

14:49.886 --> 14:51.086
It's beautiful.

14:51.153 --> 14:52.220
This is very upsetting.

14:52.288 --> 14:53.455
What are you gonna do?

14:53.522 --> 14:55.090
Just push
whomever shows up here

14:55.157 --> 14:56.357
to reclaim this
when they realize--

14:56.425 --> 14:59.593
I like it.
It matches the couch.

14:59.661 --> 15:01.295
Nina, your life is out
of control.

15:01.363 --> 15:02.863
And it's more
than just the painting.

15:02.931 --> 15:04.832
You know it is.

15:04.899 --> 15:07.100
You also know what you need
to do to reclaim it.

15:07.168 --> 15:08.868
Show up here on time,

15:08.936 --> 15:10.103
you have
to honor your commitments,

15:10.170 --> 15:12.338
and no pushing
unless absolutely necessary,

15:12.406 --> 15:14.374
or I can't have you
on this team.

15:14.441 --> 15:16.309
Right?

15:16.377 --> 15:19.912
Sorry.
Hi, Nina.

15:19.980 --> 15:21.547
Nice painting.

15:21.615 --> 15:23.682
I think Bill needs help
interviewing the wife, so--

15:23.750 --> 15:27.552
Sure.

15:27.620 --> 15:28.987
I've never seen him before.

15:29.054 --> 15:31.289
I've already been through this
with the police.

15:31.357 --> 15:35.125
All right.
She doesn't know anything.

15:35.193 --> 15:36.426
We need to be sure.

15:36.494 --> 15:37.794
Are you in charge here?

15:37.862 --> 15:38.995
'Cause I need to go.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.297
I have funeral arrangements
to make.

15:40.364 --> 15:41.598
Yes, I understand, ma'am.

15:41.666 --> 15:43.366
We're moving
as quickly as we can.

15:43.434 --> 15:46.135
Now, this young lady's
gonna ask you a few questions.

15:46.203 --> 15:49.838
If it's all right, hmm?

15:49.906 --> 15:52.408
Gently.

15:54.777 --> 15:56.111
Calm down.

16:00.819 --> 16:02.319
What do you know about him?

16:02.387 --> 16:04.588
Nothing.

16:04.655 --> 16:06.823
I've never seen him before.

16:06.890 --> 16:09.892
Like I said,
she doesn't know anything.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.660
Great.

16:12.728 --> 16:14.695
Is there anything else
we should know?

16:14.763 --> 16:19.366
Anything you're hiding?

16:19.434 --> 16:20.701
I had an affair
with Jay's brother.

16:20.769 --> 16:22.936
We never paid taxes
on any of the money

16:23.004 --> 16:26.005
that Jay made
at the clinic in Stamford.

16:26.073 --> 16:27.773
I stole a scarf once
from Bloomingdale's,

16:27.841 --> 16:29.241
because I just didn't want
to stand in line.

16:29.308 --> 16:30.609
Okay, thank--
thank you very much.

16:30.676 --> 16:33.344
I masturbate every day,
when Jay goes to work.

16:36.648 --> 16:40.050
Nina.

16:40.117 --> 16:42.919
Thank you.

16:46.189 --> 16:47.289
What?

16:47.357 --> 16:48.757
No, you're not sorry!

16:48.825 --> 16:51.059
You people are always in my way.

16:51.127 --> 16:53.028
I'm trying
to do important work here.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.295
Gary, Gary,
you all right?

16:54.363 --> 16:56.064
No, he made contact with me.

16:56.131 --> 16:57.598
- You okay?
- I don't like these people.

16:57.666 --> 16:58.966
Well, listen,
to tell you the truth,

16:59.034 --> 17:00.332
I don't either,

17:00.400 --> 17:02.094
but we have
to work with them for now,

17:02.162 --> 17:03.592
so just try to be more polite.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.426
Maybe you should
just ignore them, all right?

17:05.494 --> 17:07.127
Listen, have you come up
with any similar crimes?

17:07.194 --> 17:09.329
Barely any.
Just one so far.

17:09.396 --> 17:10.631
Similar to Dr. Westman's?

17:10.698 --> 17:13.002
Yeah, just like it.

17:13.069 --> 17:14.704
Abduction on 8th and Ellis.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.810
And the people there said
that all they saw was a blur.

17:16.878 --> 17:19.580
But that's the only one I found,
so I'm gonna keep looking.

17:19.647 --> 17:22.349
Well, we'll need to speak
with the investigating officer.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.684
He's not there yet.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.586
The police only just
got the call.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.087
Happened eight minutes ago.

17:28.155 --> 17:30.523
What?
Eight minutes ago?

17:30.591 --> 17:34.628
Gary! Wh--
Yeah. Just happened.

17:34.696 --> 17:36.062
Maybe the victim
is still alive.

17:36.130 --> 17:37.564
Well, yeah,
his number's listed,

17:37.632 --> 17:39.365
and he has a service.

17:39.433 --> 17:40.799
Do you want me
to ping his cell?

17:40.867 --> 17:42.835
Yes, yes, immediately.
Please.

17:42.903 --> 17:45.905
- Okay.
- Bill?

17:45.973 --> 17:47.573
You saw me once a week
for six months.

17:47.641 --> 17:48.941
You expect me
to believe that, huh?

17:49.009 --> 17:50.376
I saw many patients.

17:50.444 --> 17:52.144
I'm sorry.
I don't remember!

17:52.212 --> 17:53.478
Let me tell you something.

17:53.546 --> 17:55.080
You know what?
It doesn't even matter, okay?

17:55.147 --> 17:56.014
'Cause you're a dead man.
You're a freaking dead man.

17:56.081 --> 18:00.751
I'm gonna cut your throat.

18:04.422 --> 18:07.057
Move it!

18:07.125 --> 18:09.259
Move!
Patrol the block!

18:43.539 --> 18:45.692
He kept saying
that he was a patient of mine.

18:45.765 --> 18:48.466
But I'm telling you,
I have no idea who he is.

18:48.534 --> 18:53.170
Uh, perhaps you will
recognize him now, hmm?

18:53.238 --> 18:54.638
That kid.

18:54.706 --> 18:57.707
What does he have to do
with this man who attacked me?

18:57.775 --> 19:01.311
It's the same person--
Eli Aquino.

19:01.379 --> 19:02.845
He suffers
from accelerated aging.

19:02.913 --> 19:05.047
Okay, who are you people,
anyways?

19:05.115 --> 19:06.615
And why am I not speaking
to the police, here?

19:06.683 --> 19:09.952
Because we are the ones that
saved your ass.

19:10.020 --> 19:12.188
We work with the police,
Dr. Casey.

19:12.255 --> 19:13.655
Now you're gonna need
some protection.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.280
But in order for us
to provide you that,

19:15.348 --> 19:16.715
we're gonna need
your cooperation.

19:16.782 --> 19:18.216
Otherwise,
you're gonna look like this,

19:18.284 --> 19:21.919
if he comes back
looking for you.

19:21.987 --> 19:24.320
That's Jay Westman.

19:24.388 --> 19:25.888
Was Jay Westman.

19:25.956 --> 19:27.924
He worked for
the Yankee Medical Group.

19:27.991 --> 19:29.258
Is that a clinic in
Stamford, Connecticut,

19:29.326 --> 19:30.426
by any chance?

19:30.494 --> 19:31.794
Yes.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.596
Well, what were you
doing there?

19:33.664 --> 19:36.998
We were researching therapies
in pediatric hyperactivity.

19:37.066 --> 19:38.166
Mmhmm.

19:38.234 --> 19:39.434
I was not in charge
of anything.

19:39.502 --> 19:42.070
I just administered the BWE.
And that's all.

19:42.137 --> 19:44.472
You administered the BWE?
What is that?

19:44.540 --> 19:46.307
Brainwave entrainment therapy.

19:46.375 --> 19:49.176
Uses light and sound
to alter brain structures.

19:49.244 --> 19:50.877
Highly controversial.

19:50.945 --> 19:51.978
As far as I know,
that has not progressed

19:52.046 --> 19:53.245
beyond the experimental stage.

19:53.313 --> 19:55.014
Wait, what are we saying?

19:55.082 --> 19:56.348
That he's using kids
as guinea pigs?

19:56.416 --> 19:58.817
Listen, all those parents
signed releases.

19:58.885 --> 20:02.253
And we did do some
very significant research.

20:02.321 --> 20:03.321
Yeah, well,
your significant research

20:03.389 --> 20:05.789
is coming back to kill you.

20:19.338 --> 20:25.142
Easy now.

20:25.210 --> 20:27.978
That should help
with the pain.

20:28.045 --> 20:31.147
Thank you.

20:31.215 --> 20:32.815
It's better than morphine,

20:32.883 --> 20:35.584
and you don't need
a prescription.

20:35.652 --> 20:37.286
The doctor's don't think
that she'll come back

20:37.354 --> 20:41.757
for a last good-bye.

20:41.824 --> 20:46.395
Meaning, she'll have a few
long, gray, painful weeks,

20:46.462 --> 20:49.565
and...

20:49.633 --> 20:51.467
then she'll be gone.

20:54.937 --> 20:56.437
That's awful.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.839
No one should have
to bury a grandchild.

20:58.907 --> 21:00.474
I've buried 31.

21:00.542 --> 21:03.976
She's the last.

21:04.044 --> 21:07.507
She was a lovely child.

21:07.575 --> 21:11.041
She only knew me
as a distant cousin.

21:13.511 --> 21:15.979
I'm glad we spent time
together.

21:21.318 --> 21:23.219
How's your father?

21:23.286 --> 21:26.018
Now that he's
amongst the free?

21:33.258 --> 21:37.226
Anxious?

21:37.294 --> 21:40.429
You could...talk to him.

21:40.497 --> 21:43.532
Explain how things could be.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.067
You said you wanted
to reach out to him.

21:46.135 --> 21:48.103
He needs to get there
on his own.

21:48.171 --> 21:53.308
At least part of the way.

21:53.375 --> 21:57.911
And Cameron?

21:57.979 --> 22:00.647
He's good.

22:00.715 --> 22:02.516
He's a nice guy.

22:02.583 --> 22:05.118
Which is kind of a first
for me.

22:05.186 --> 22:07.720
Hmm.

22:07.788 --> 22:10.756
I hope that
you two can remain friends.

22:10.824 --> 22:12.224
What?

22:12.292 --> 22:13.825
With your father back,
you can't afford

22:13.893 --> 22:16.494
to lose control
of your emotions.

22:16.562 --> 22:20.331
You know how you get
when you're involved.

22:20.399 --> 22:24.634
We all make sacrifices.

22:28.727 --> 22:30.493
Hey!

22:30.561 --> 22:33.195
This is nice surprise,
huh?

22:33.263 --> 22:35.797
Couldn't get through the day
without a little Hicks fix?

22:35.864 --> 22:37.598
That was literally my best line.

22:37.666 --> 22:39.133
Come on.
What's up?

22:41.802 --> 22:44.203
Look, Cam, uh...

22:44.271 --> 22:46.338
I like you...a lot.
Yeah.

22:46.406 --> 22:50.173
Um, and this has been great.

22:50.241 --> 22:51.935
"This has been great"?

22:52.003 --> 22:54.364
Where is this going?

22:54.431 --> 22:56.498
It's like you said, um,

22:56.565 --> 23:01.400
my dad's back now,
and things are too complicated.

23:01.467 --> 23:06.401
So, um, I think it's probably
best if we just end this.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.369
Now where is this
coming from?

23:08.436 --> 23:10.436
Come on.

23:10.504 --> 23:11.636
Come on,
we have a connection, right?

23:11.704 --> 23:13.070
No, no, look.

23:13.138 --> 23:14.371
We have a connection,
and I'm not talking about him.

23:14.438 --> 23:15.904
It's brain chemistry, Cam.

23:15.972 --> 23:18.439
- No, no, Dani, that is not it.
- It's the way my ability works.

23:18.507 --> 23:19.772
Dani, that's not it.

23:19.840 --> 23:21.473
Look, every guy
I've ever been with

23:21.541 --> 23:22.674
has said the same thing, okay?

23:22.741 --> 23:28.543
It's a hyperlimbic
feedback loop.

23:28.611 --> 23:29.810
What you're feeling,
it's not real.

23:29.877 --> 23:30.910
Listen to me.

23:30.978 --> 23:33.377
- No, we're not...
- Dani.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.511
- Real, okay?
- Dani, don't do this, okay?

23:35.579 --> 23:37.679
Sorry.

23:42.680 --> 23:45.143
It's unbelievable,
what this guy's been doing

23:45.211 --> 23:46.710
with these kids.

23:46.778 --> 23:49.344
Forget pulling his license,
this guy needs to go to jail.

23:49.412 --> 23:52.346
You're right, of course,
but we have to let him go.

23:52.413 --> 23:53.613
What are you talking about?

23:53.680 --> 23:55.514
Bill, it's only
a matter of time

23:55.582 --> 23:57.782
before Eli tries
to get at Dr. Casey again.

23:57.849 --> 24:00.749
And, uh, when he does,
you and Cameron will be waiting.

24:00.817 --> 24:02.050
You want to use him as bait?

24:02.118 --> 24:05.351
Doc, are you--
do you know how fast Eli is?

24:05.419 --> 24:07.385
Casey will be dead,
and Eli will be gone.

24:07.453 --> 24:10.019
Yeah. And I also know
how fast Cameron can react.

24:10.086 --> 24:11.319
And you too,
when you need to.

24:11.387 --> 24:13.287
And what, with
the support Gary is providing,

24:13.354 --> 24:14.620
I am betting on this team.

24:14.688 --> 24:18.556
Doc, there is no team.

24:18.623 --> 24:20.289
Whatever team we have
is not ready.

24:20.357 --> 24:22.957
I think
they are ready, Bill.

24:23.025 --> 24:24.925
Why are you doubting
my decision?

24:24.993 --> 24:26.725
'Cause I've been here
for the last eight months,

24:26.793 --> 24:28.226
every day, okay?
Yeah, mmhmm.

24:28.294 --> 24:29.860
And you've been back--what?--
Less than a week?

24:29.928 --> 24:33.862
Listen, Bill, I know
what you're going through.

24:33.929 --> 24:36.262
I went away,
and things fell apart.

24:36.330 --> 24:38.830
And you took control
of the team.

24:38.898 --> 24:41.465
And now I'm back, and it's
causing you a lot of anxiety.

24:41.532 --> 24:43.065
Losing control
has never been something

24:43.133 --> 24:44.799
you've been comfortable with.

24:44.867 --> 24:46.000
This about <i>me</i> losing control?
Is that what you're saying?

24:46.067 --> 24:47.400
- Listen.
- I'm a control freak?

24:47.468 --> 24:48.700
Bill, you've taken care
of things marvelously

24:48.768 --> 24:49.968
since I've been gone.

24:50.035 --> 24:51.302
You and I both know
what happened here

24:51.369 --> 24:54.103
is because of your ego.
Excuse me?

24:54.170 --> 24:56.438
You went
on national television

24:56.505 --> 24:57.738
talking about Alphas.
Yes.

24:57.806 --> 25:00.240
Without telling us?
Without telling me?

25:00.307 --> 25:02.341
Why did you pull that stunt?
Because I needed to.

25:02.409 --> 25:04.377
No, no, what you needed.
You needed to hear your name.

25:04.445 --> 25:05.748
You needed to make
some kind of statement,

25:05.816 --> 25:07.317
and we were left
to clean up the mess.

25:07.385 --> 25:09.419
Hell, yes, I've got doubts!

25:09.487 --> 25:11.887
If you truly feel that way,
maybe you should just go.

25:14.823 --> 25:18.123
Yeah.

25:28.599 --> 25:31.828
Wouldn't want to be
on the other end of that thing.

25:31.886 --> 25:33.319
Just tranq darts.

25:33.386 --> 25:36.188
We're laying a trap
for Aquino tonight.

25:36.256 --> 25:38.456
Look...

25:38.524 --> 25:40.258
I know you're angry,

25:40.325 --> 25:43.694
and...I get it.

25:43.761 --> 25:45.561
No, seriously, Nina,
I'm over it.

25:45.629 --> 25:49.631
Well, I'm not.

25:49.699 --> 25:52.835
I never should have used
my ability on you.

25:52.902 --> 25:56.337
Sometimes it just...

25:56.405 --> 25:59.640
it happens, and...

25:59.708 --> 26:01.676
I didn't even know
I was using it.

26:01.744 --> 26:03.845
And we had something.

26:03.912 --> 26:09.216
And...I ruined it.

26:09.283 --> 26:10.550
It's okay.

26:10.618 --> 26:14.620
No, it's not.

26:14.688 --> 26:16.622
I want to make things right.

26:16.689 --> 26:22.593
I want us to try again.

26:27.065 --> 26:31.466
Look, Nina,
I'm seeing someone.

26:31.534 --> 26:34.067
What?

26:38.773 --> 26:40.073
Who?
Doesn't matter.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.174
No, I want to know.

26:41.242 --> 26:42.342
It doesn't make
any difference.

26:42.410 --> 26:45.245
Tell me who she is!

26:45.313 --> 26:47.613
Nina, what's wrong?

26:47.681 --> 26:48.714
Don't pretend you didn't know,
okay?

26:48.782 --> 26:50.249
Because you know everything!

26:55.254 --> 26:56.754
It seems quiet.

26:56.821 --> 26:58.589
You sure the entrances
are clear, Gary?

26:58.656 --> 27:00.791
Yeah, don't worry.
I'm on my game.

27:00.859 --> 27:03.360
Dr. Casey's building
has really good cameras.

27:03.428 --> 27:04.628
Anything, Hicks?

27:04.696 --> 27:07.664
- Uh, sorry, what?
- Come on, focus, bro.

27:07.732 --> 27:11.101
Know Casey's a douche, but we're
supposed to keep him alive.

27:11.169 --> 27:13.270
Hicks is distracted
by his girl problems.

27:13.338 --> 27:15.138
Ha! I don't have
girl problems,

27:15.206 --> 27:17.673
so I have complete focus.

27:17.741 --> 27:19.508
You're having problems
with Nina, huh?

27:19.576 --> 27:22.277
No, he had breakfast
with Dani Rosen,

27:22.345 --> 27:23.611
and she said
that it "was yummy."

27:23.679 --> 27:25.412
But Hicks wouldn't tell me
what they ate.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.848
- Is that so?
- Hmph.

27:27.916 --> 27:31.051
Wait, Hicks, was breakfast
not really breakfast?

27:31.118 --> 27:32.418
Was breakfast sex?

27:32.486 --> 27:34.520
I am not having
this conversation right now.

27:34.588 --> 27:37.957
- Hicks, I broke your sex code.
- Dani Rosen?

27:38.025 --> 27:41.694
With either one of you.

27:44.831 --> 27:47.766
Nina's not returning
any of my calls.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.537
Dr. Rosen I've never seen her
this upset.

27:53.605 --> 27:57.040
I don't know what to do--
Well, Rachel, um...

27:57.107 --> 27:58.841
she'll be fine.

27:58.909 --> 28:00.776
She's just working
on some things.

28:00.844 --> 28:02.444
I've seen her
like this before.

28:02.512 --> 28:05.213
And...you shouldn't worry
about it.

28:05.281 --> 28:07.749
- Do you need some help?
- Uh, no, no.

28:07.817 --> 28:10.084
I'm all right.

28:10.152 --> 28:11.719
Why don't you go home?
You can get some rest.

28:11.787 --> 28:14.555
You know what?
I'm gonna go to the stakeout.

28:14.623 --> 28:15.890
Eli's really fast,

28:15.958 --> 28:17.658
and the guys could use
an extra set of eyes.

28:17.726 --> 28:20.894
You're right, Rachel.
Thank you.

28:31.971 --> 28:35.740
Nina--

28:42.681 --> 28:46.483
Eli?

28:48.085 --> 28:52.621
Please.
Don't make me hurt you.

28:52.689 --> 28:55.924
I'm not here to kill you,
but I...

28:55.992 --> 28:57.459
I will if you don't do
what I want.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.529
Well, what is it
that you want, Eli?

28:59.597 --> 29:01.998
I just--

29:02.066 --> 29:04.434
I want you to stop this.
Please.

29:04.502 --> 29:06.136
Is that why you killed
Dr. Westman?

29:06.203 --> 29:07.637
Be-because he wouldn't help you?

29:07.705 --> 29:09.638
No, he just--he didn't care.

29:09.706 --> 29:11.140
He pretended
like he didn't remember me.

29:11.207 --> 29:13.042
Like I just--I didn't--
I was nothing.

29:13.109 --> 29:14.409
Like I didn't matter.

29:14.477 --> 29:16.745
I'm not like
those doctors, Eli.

29:16.813 --> 29:18.947
I promise you,
I do not see you that way.

29:19.014 --> 29:22.884
I'm 22 years old!
Look at me!

29:25.954 --> 29:30.561
It was wrong,
what they did to you.

29:30.628 --> 29:34.868
Eli, I know how precious
time is to you.

29:34.936 --> 29:38.337
I will do everything I can
as quickly as I can

29:38.405 --> 29:42.874
to help you,
but I need you to trust me.

29:42.942 --> 29:46.711
Please.

29:46.779 --> 29:48.647
Are you really having sex
with Dani?

29:48.714 --> 29:50.148
Oh, did we not finish
talking about this?

29:50.215 --> 29:51.749
I mean she's
Dr. Rosen's daughter.

29:51.817 --> 29:55.218
- Please, somebody, say yes.
- No, I don't understand.

29:55.286 --> 29:56.787
Okay, you break up with Nina,

29:56.854 --> 29:58.421
because she used her ability
on you,

29:58.489 --> 29:59.889
but then you like it
when Dani does?

29:59.957 --> 30:01.224
It's manipulation both ways.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.759
- No, it's totally different.
- How?

30:03.827 --> 30:07.095
Well, you know, hot steamy
sex is always different.

30:07.163 --> 30:09.595
So that's the difference, huh?
Hot sex?

30:09.663 --> 30:11.729
No, it's not--

30:11.797 --> 30:13.965
Listen, it's about
a connection, okay?

30:14.032 --> 30:16.534
Now Dani says
it's her ability,

30:16.602 --> 30:18.169
but...I'm telling you,

30:18.237 --> 30:19.604
I never felt this way,

30:19.672 --> 30:21.572
but, please, let it go.

30:21.640 --> 30:23.140
This is wrong.

30:23.208 --> 30:24.908
Mindblowing sex
could never be wrong, ever.

30:24.976 --> 30:26.843
No, this.
This is wrong.

30:26.911 --> 30:28.978
Okay, we've been here
for too long.

30:29.046 --> 30:31.247
Eli--he's not patient, right?
He doesn't have time--

30:31.315 --> 30:33.116
What, are you the Eli expert,
now? Come on now.

30:33.184 --> 30:36.319
In the office,
I felt something.

30:36.387 --> 30:40.256
Bill, I think we're waiting
in the wrong place.

30:40.324 --> 30:43.025
Come on, you two.

30:45.795 --> 30:47.495
Gotta try to stay still,
but I'm just,

30:47.563 --> 30:49.597
You know,
I'm not good at it.

30:49.665 --> 30:50.932
What does it say?

30:51.000 --> 30:54.201
Uh, Eli, I know
this is difficult for you.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.136
Just.
We're getting there.

30:56.204 --> 30:58.472
And I just want you to know
that the MRI is just one

30:58.539 --> 30:59.739
of many tests that I'm going
to need to run.

30:59.807 --> 31:01.308
Oh, God.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.842
They ran me through a million
of those things at Stamford.

31:02.910 --> 31:04.210
Well, do you remember
the names of any of them?

31:04.278 --> 31:05.411
Of course, I don't.

31:05.479 --> 31:06.879
Or any of the equipment
they used?

31:06.947 --> 31:07.713
All I know is they kept
putting me through stuff,

31:07.781 --> 31:09.314
and things just got worse.

31:09.381 --> 31:10.481
I just kept getting older and
faster, and older and faster.

31:10.549 --> 31:12.315
Maybe that was
their intention.

31:16.952 --> 31:20.120
Who's this dude?
I know him.

31:20.188 --> 31:22.022
You know Stanton Parish?

31:22.090 --> 31:23.257
I don't know his name.

31:23.325 --> 31:24.391
But I saw him a few times
at the clinic.

31:24.459 --> 31:25.626
Wait, wait.
He was a patient?

31:25.694 --> 31:26.961
No, man,
he ran the joint.

31:27.028 --> 31:28.462
Why do you have his picture?

31:28.530 --> 31:29.463
Do you work for him
or something?

31:29.531 --> 31:30.964
No, no, no.

31:31.032 --> 31:33.467
I most certainly
do not work for him.

31:33.534 --> 31:35.535
Eli, what else can you tell me
about him.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.570
How about nothing,
all right?

31:37.637 --> 31:38.971
He's not the important one here.
I am.

31:39.039 --> 31:41.607
So let's focus on me
a little bit, okay?

31:41.675 --> 31:44.539
Focus.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.342
Rosen's phone is on voicemail.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.576
I'm gonna call Cley.

31:53.644 --> 31:54.744
Dani?

31:54.812 --> 31:55.879
Cam, it's me.

31:55.946 --> 31:57.213
Look, I'm at the office.

31:57.281 --> 31:58.481
There's a guy here with my dad.

31:58.548 --> 32:00.249
It just--I don't know.

32:00.316 --> 32:03.852
It doesn't feel right.

32:08.424 --> 32:10.157
- Who the hell is this?
- It's my daughter.

32:10.225 --> 32:11.325
She just called somebody!

32:11.392 --> 32:13.360
She's screwing
the whole thing up!

32:13.427 --> 32:15.928
Listen, Eli.
Listen to me please.

32:15.996 --> 32:18.197
I promised to help you
and I will.

32:18.265 --> 32:19.898
Now you want some answers?

32:19.966 --> 32:22.433
I think I know
where we can find some.

32:22.501 --> 32:23.968
Just leave my daughter
out of this.

32:24.036 --> 32:27.171
She has nothing to do
with this.

32:40.816 --> 32:42.183
You okay?
You all right?

32:42.251 --> 32:44.051
He took my dad.

32:44.119 --> 32:47.955
I don't know where.
Okay.

32:48.022 --> 32:51.123
Gary I need you to ping
Dr. Rosen's phone now.

32:51.191 --> 32:54.493
His phone's at the office,
but it's broke.

32:54.561 --> 32:56.562
But he has the extended
warranty, so that's okay.

32:56.630 --> 32:58.430
I don't care, okay?

32:58.498 --> 32:59.698
Do what you have to do
to find him.

32:59.766 --> 33:03.368
Let's go.

33:03.435 --> 33:06.237
Okay, he just went past
the camera at 287.

33:06.304 --> 33:08.472
He's going really fast
and he's going to get a ticket.

33:08.540 --> 33:10.607
Oh, but there's
road construction.

33:10.675 --> 33:12.508
Want you to watch
for upcoming exits, okay?

33:12.576 --> 33:15.778
Find us an alternate route.
We need to catch up to them.

33:15.846 --> 33:17.880
Dani, don't worry,
we won't lose 'em.

33:26.047 --> 33:28.981
It was here.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.183
The medical clinic
was here?

33:31.250 --> 33:33.251
427 Addison.
You're sure about this?

33:33.319 --> 33:35.420
Yankee Medical Group?

33:35.488 --> 33:37.889
Yeah, I remember
that church.

33:37.957 --> 33:39.891
Well, I'm sorry Eli.

33:39.959 --> 33:41.793
I'd hoped we'd find
some answers here.

33:41.861 --> 33:44.329
What now?
More tests?

33:44.397 --> 33:46.064
Yes, we can do that.

33:46.131 --> 33:48.099
No. Oh, man.

33:48.167 --> 33:49.867
This is so unfair.

33:49.935 --> 33:51.435
I just want things to go back
to the way they were.

33:51.503 --> 33:52.703
I have to be honest with you.

33:52.771 --> 33:55.506
That's not going
to be possible.

33:55.574 --> 33:57.174
We may be able
to slow down the process,

33:57.241 --> 33:59.041
but it cannot be reversed.

34:04.847 --> 34:06.281
You told him where
we were going?

34:06.349 --> 34:07.749
No, no, I didn't.

34:07.816 --> 34:09.250
- No, you did!
- I promise you, I didn't.

34:09.318 --> 34:11.118
You never wanted to help me.
You're just like all the rest.

34:11.186 --> 34:13.120
Over there.

34:13.188 --> 34:16.056
They're in the church.

34:20.228 --> 34:23.396
I can slit his throat faster
than you can pull that trigger.

34:23.464 --> 34:24.797
Cameron, no!

34:24.864 --> 34:29.068
No one is killing anyone
here today!

34:29.136 --> 34:30.536
I'm gonna die anyway.

34:30.603 --> 34:31.938
Listen to me, Eli.

34:32.005 --> 34:34.540
You could have years left
to live.

34:34.608 --> 34:35.975
Don't throw that away.

34:36.042 --> 34:38.610
- You said I could trust you.
- Yes, and you can.

34:38.678 --> 34:40.645
I know how desperate
you feel right now.

34:40.713 --> 34:42.413
No, you don't.
Nobody does.

34:42.481 --> 34:44.516
There's nobody like me.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.085
- Dani, stay back!
- Eli.

34:46.154 --> 34:50.728
- Dani.
- It's okay.

34:50.795 --> 34:53.964
You shouldn't have
followed us here tonight.

34:54.032 --> 34:57.000
I can help.

35:09.445 --> 35:11.046
Oh, my God.

35:13.549 --> 35:17.585
It feels so good
to slow down.

35:19.555 --> 35:21.355
Thank you.

35:24.126 --> 35:27.528
Dani!

35:37.339 --> 35:41.008
Who took the shot?
Who took that shot?

35:41.076 --> 35:42.677
He was just a kid.

36:00.793 --> 36:05.362
An investigation
is currently underway.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.797
It's still not clear
who took the shot.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.966
So you guys are saying
you didn't do a chamber check?

36:09.034 --> 36:10.667
An investigation is underway.

36:10.735 --> 36:12.102
Uh, Nathan,

36:12.169 --> 36:14.370
we have complete confidence
in you and your team.

36:14.438 --> 36:16.605
I'm sure Agent Harken wasn't
trying to imply anything.

36:16.673 --> 36:18.040
I appreciate that.

36:18.107 --> 36:20.008
I know you'll get
to the bottom of this.

36:20.076 --> 36:23.545
But said, uh,
I'm sure you can see

36:23.613 --> 36:26.715
that my team is a little
out of sync at the moment.

36:26.782 --> 36:28.049
It's entirely my fault.

36:28.117 --> 36:29.617
I take full responsibility
for that,

36:29.685 --> 36:31.986
'cause I really haven't
been able to make them

36:32.054 --> 36:34.188
comfortable with all
the changes around here.

36:34.256 --> 36:36.287
I get it, we're jammed
in here pretty tight.

36:36.354 --> 36:37.654
Yes, we are.

36:37.721 --> 36:39.521
It would be easier
if we had a little more space--

36:39.589 --> 36:42.224
breathing room, if you will.

36:42.291 --> 36:43.324
Believe me, my people
are saying the same thing.

36:43.392 --> 36:44.559
Well, I'm not surprised.

36:44.626 --> 36:48.028
Um, but, you know,
we may all be in luck.

36:48.096 --> 36:50.063
Bill, was it you who told me

36:50.131 --> 36:53.266
about the third floor
being available for lease?

36:53.334 --> 36:54.467
Yeah, I did.

36:54.535 --> 36:56.035
I told you
about the third floor.

36:56.103 --> 36:57.269
Third floor?

36:57.337 --> 37:01.974
Yeah, the entire third floor.

37:02.041 --> 37:07.178
I'll look into it.

37:12.484 --> 37:14.050
Played that one
really well, Doc.

37:14.118 --> 37:15.785
"An investigation
is under way"?

37:15.853 --> 37:18.053
You looked like you wanted
to strangle him for that, but--

37:18.121 --> 37:23.532
Bill, I told that young man
that he could trust me.

37:23.599 --> 37:27.042
And--
and he was gunned down just--

37:28.644 --> 37:30.345
Listen, Bill, um--

37:30.412 --> 37:34.916
what you said earlier,
about my motives, my hubris,

37:34.984 --> 37:36.284
there's probably a lot
of truth in that.

37:36.352 --> 37:39.153
I have let you all down
in some fashion.

37:39.221 --> 37:44.290
And, uh, and I hope
to make it up to you.

37:44.357 --> 37:49.694
Look, um, I wanted
to be straight with you.

37:49.761 --> 37:50.861
Please.

37:50.928 --> 37:54.130
I want to be with him.

37:57.001 --> 38:01.972
I appreciate your candor.

38:02.039 --> 38:04.407
You deserve to be happy.

38:04.475 --> 38:08.144
As does Mr. Hicks.

38:08.212 --> 38:11.013
Just be careful.

38:13.483 --> 38:17.419
Hey, where's Nina?

38:17.487 --> 38:18.787
Has anyone heard from her?

38:18.854 --> 38:23.691
Hicks hasn't.
But he has heard from Dani.

38:23.759 --> 38:25.425
He calls her "baby",
which is weird,

38:25.493 --> 38:26.826
because they're the same age.

38:26.894 --> 38:28.328
Gary, listen,
I will kill you, okay?

38:28.395 --> 38:29.562
No, I'll kill you first.

38:29.630 --> 38:31.263
I get up at 7:42.

38:31.331 --> 38:35.200
Gary.

38:35.268 --> 38:38.737
What happened last night
was--was very, very wrong

38:38.804 --> 38:40.938
on probably every level.

38:41.006 --> 38:43.374
Sheer incompetence
or something worse.

38:43.442 --> 38:44.709
Yeah, it was the government.
They killed him.

38:44.776 --> 38:46.844
That's what they do.
They're jerk-asses.

38:46.912 --> 38:49.247
Dr. Rosen, I told you,
I tried to warn you,

38:49.314 --> 38:50.914
when they stole my pudding.

38:50.982 --> 38:52.015
Well, be that as it may,
Gary, we are going

38:52.083 --> 38:53.449
to continue
to work with Mr. Cley,

38:53.517 --> 38:54.684
and his tactical agents,

38:54.752 --> 38:57.220
and his group of analysts.

38:57.288 --> 38:59.322
But with one
very important adjustment--

38:59.390 --> 39:01.057
they will no longer be privy

39:01.124 --> 39:04.126
to any of the inner workings
of this office.

39:07.562 --> 39:10.364
They may very well
have killed...

39:10.431 --> 39:13.233
our first concrete connection
to Stanton Parish.

39:13.300 --> 39:14.801
Wait, are you saying
that Stanton Parish

39:14.869 --> 39:16.269
is connected to Eli's death?

39:16.337 --> 39:18.604
Rachel, I don't know,
but I'm not ruling anything out.

39:18.672 --> 39:19.872
But if he is,

39:19.940 --> 39:23.941
it has some
very serious implications.

39:24.008 --> 39:26.709
Which means
that the people in this room,

39:26.776 --> 39:28.109
and this includes Nina,

39:28.177 --> 39:32.213
are the only people
that you can truly count on.

39:32.280 --> 39:33.981
From this moment on,
you are to consider this

39:34.048 --> 39:36.382
as your only
circle of trust.

40:11.625 --> 40:15.627
Sleep well, sweet angel.

40:23.568 --> 40:25.536
Shh, shh, shh.

41:01.672 --> 41:06.942
Thought I might
find you here.

41:07.010 --> 41:09.545
1920 Le Regle de jeu.

41:09.612 --> 41:13.748
Hmm, always
the most expensive, right?

41:13.816 --> 41:18.853
I hear you killed
another Alpha.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.721
That's not fair.

41:20.789 --> 41:23.023
Yeah, well, a lot of people
like me die around you,

41:23.091 --> 41:27.059
but it's never your fault.

41:27.127 --> 41:28.894
All right, so what's going on
with you, Nina?

41:28.962 --> 41:30.296
Why haven't you returned
our calls?

41:30.363 --> 41:31.964
I'm done.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.733
- You're what?
- I'm done.

41:34.801 --> 41:38.737
So you can tell Rachel
that she can have the Van Gogh.

41:38.804 --> 41:40.805
It's pointless
without the couch.

41:40.873 --> 41:45.209
And consider this
my resignation letter.

41:45.277 --> 41:50.747
Oh, and, um...FYI...

41:50.815 --> 41:54.550
Hicks is nailing your daughter.

41:54.618 --> 41:56.285
Nina, it's important for you

41:56.353 --> 41:59.587
to be among people you can trust
when you're like this.

41:59.655 --> 42:02.023
- Trust?
- Alone is not good--

42:02.091 --> 42:04.158
Stop talking.

42:04.226 --> 42:07.194
Get this through your head.

42:07.261 --> 42:10.597
It's over.

42:10.664 --> 42:12.498
I'm gone.

42:23.309 --> 42:24.776
Excuse me, sir.

42:24.844 --> 42:26.678
I'm sorry,
we're closing.
