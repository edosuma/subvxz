WEBVTT

00:09.277 --> 00:11.245
Previously on Billions...

00:11.345 --> 00:13.981
NFL thinks it would be
best for all involved

00:14.082 --> 00:15.583
if you didn't bid.

00:15.683 --> 00:16.584
Stated reason?

00:16.684 --> 00:18.086
Public perception.

00:18.186 --> 00:20.654
I think we should start
something -- a business.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.723
Yay!

00:22.823 --> 00:24.792
I'm already set up
in an office of my own,

00:24.892 --> 00:25.993
starting to see clients.

00:26.094 --> 00:29.997
-Is that permanent?
-I'm not sure...yet.

00:30.098 --> 00:31.832
I'm keeping my options open.

00:31.932 --> 00:33.301
Say hello to my nephew,
Marco.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.368
Kid just got elected

00:34.468 --> 00:36.070
to county executive
up in Sandicot.

00:36.170 --> 00:38.272
I'm Marc. An honor to meet you,
Mr. Axelrod.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.541
You will give me
what I need.

00:40.641 --> 00:43.344
Or maybe we'll have
a pepperoni slice in Yonkers.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.313
We can invite your boss.

00:45.413 --> 00:47.315
Sleeping well
has become important to me.

00:47.415 --> 00:49.117
So is looking my daughter
in the eye,

00:49.217 --> 00:51.285
knowing she's looking back
at a good person.

00:51.385 --> 00:53.554
Congratulations.
If I fire you now, it'll look

00:53.654 --> 00:55.656
like the administration
is protecting Boyd,

00:55.756 --> 00:56.924
obstructing justice.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.692
There's a reason
no one's done this.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.394
I'll just fire you
in a few months.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.695
All you've bought is time.

01:01.795 --> 01:03.964
I got news last night
I never wanted to get --

01:04.064 --> 01:05.899
Chuck Rhoades,
coming at me.

01:05.999 --> 01:08.236
You squared off with him,
walked away unmarked.

01:08.336 --> 01:10.838
I need your playbook,
I need to know how to beat him.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.706
Lawrence Boyd
can be friend to no man.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.543
He needs to dominate you
in his own mind

01:15.643 --> 01:17.745
by heaving his seed
into your bride.

01:19.680 --> 01:20.781
Turn it off.

01:20.881 --> 01:22.783
Disgrace him.
Humble him.

01:22.883 --> 01:24.752
Boyd's been rigging
Treasury bids.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.287
I'll get you whatever I can.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.055
Whatever it takes,
I'm in.

01:42.670 --> 01:45.739
* ominous music *

01:52.913 --> 01:56.684
I've seeded
over 125 companies.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.118
I don't do it
to make money.

01:58.219 --> 02:02.055
If money comes with that,
and it always has, that's fine.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.057
But it's not the driver.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.093
I do it for the same reason

02:06.194 --> 02:08.529
that Edison created
telephonic communication,

02:08.629 --> 02:10.431
Oppenheimer
harnessed nuclear fission,

02:10.531 --> 02:13.267
and DJ Kool Herc set up
two turntables and a microphone

02:13.367 --> 02:15.769
on Sedgewick Avenue
in the Bronx --

02:15.869 --> 02:20.674
to move at great velocity
towards a better future.

02:20.774 --> 02:22.676
And this?

02:22.776 --> 02:24.945
This represents
the culmination of it all.

02:25.045 --> 02:27.948
Farpoint isn't just going to
bring the earth closer together.

02:28.048 --> 02:30.518
It's going to bring us
closer to what's out there.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.855
This is the first one
you sent into orbit.

02:34.955 --> 02:35.989
Yeah.

02:36.089 --> 02:39.493
We're two generations
beyond Manticore.

02:39.593 --> 02:40.761
Manticore-3 --

02:40.861 --> 02:44.198
"The first ship to make
a manned mission to Mars."

02:44.298 --> 02:46.700
That your impersonation
of me?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.203
Well, you've certainly
said it enough times.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.708
That's how
I make it happen.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.313
Elena Gabriel.

02:59.413 --> 03:02.149
Lead candidate
for that first mission.

03:02.250 --> 03:03.751
Well, it'll take
a couple of days

03:03.851 --> 03:05.453
for me to do
a full work-up on it.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.221
We have a conference room
set aside.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.989
I appreciate that,
but since she has

03:09.089 --> 03:10.558
no prior relationship
with me --

03:10.658 --> 03:12.360
Build rapport
however you want, okay?

03:12.460 --> 03:14.828
Just, keep in mind,
we're not giving her the keys

03:14.928 --> 03:17.565
to a school bus here.
This is a $1.2 billion vessel.

03:17.665 --> 03:19.267
And your legacy.
I get all that.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.035
You need to know that she's
psychologically bulletproof.

03:22.135 --> 03:25.406
There she is.
Right on time.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.707
Does that mean anything?

03:26.807 --> 03:30.210
Yeah, that her watch works.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.679
Elena Gabriel.

03:31.779 --> 03:34.315
Ah, dominant handshake.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.616
Intentional?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.018
You tell me.

03:38.118 --> 03:41.789
Elena will show you
around the facility.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.925
I know what you're
doing with the lawsuit.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.527
What am I doing
with the lawsuit?

03:46.627 --> 03:48.629
Look, Axe,
I spent seven years

03:48.729 --> 03:50.364
and more money
than I care to admit

03:50.464 --> 03:52.733
fighting the S.E.C.
just to clear my name.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.868
-And you did.
-Fuck, yeah, I did,

03:54.968 --> 03:56.404
but in those seven years,

03:56.504 --> 03:58.706
I tried to buy
two baseball teams.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.575
You may notice --
I don't own a baseball team.

04:01.675 --> 04:04.545
You think the S.E.C.
was the dealbreaker?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.880
It fucking didn't help.
That's for damn sure.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.582
Look, Axe,
we're different, right?

04:08.682 --> 04:10.217
We didn't inherit
our money.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.586
We earned it
calling bullshit early,

04:12.686 --> 04:14.788
often, and very publicly.

04:14.888 --> 04:16.290
The NFL
doesn't like that shit.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.459
They're afraid
you're gonna break etiquette,

04:18.559 --> 04:19.793
come in long and loud.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.396
They think you're gonna be
the Mark Cuban of the NFL.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.264
Oh, so I'm pre-fucked?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.899
You need to make it clear
to them

04:25.999 --> 04:27.568
that you're hanging up
the gloves

04:27.668 --> 04:28.969
and moving on to a new phase.

04:29.069 --> 04:31.038
You know
what else you need to do?

04:31.138 --> 04:33.541
You need to stop fucking
with the U.S. attorney.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.942
I'm not gonna do that.

04:35.042 --> 04:36.510
Come on, Axe.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.579
So, when are
they gonna make the decision?

04:38.679 --> 04:39.747
This week.

04:39.847 --> 04:41.649
You know,
even if you win this lawsuit,

04:41.749 --> 04:43.216
that's the long game.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.687
If you really want this team,
you got to ask yourself --

04:46.787 --> 04:50.591
How are you gonna change
hearts and minds today?

04:50.691 --> 04:53.694
* ominous music *

05:02.470 --> 05:04.938
Well, the Japanese
would be proud.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.174
You waited
until the meal was done.

05:08.876 --> 05:11.144
But at this point,
hit me with it,

05:11.244 --> 05:12.980
and let us both
get on with our days.

05:13.080 --> 05:14.682
What's the status
on Spartan-Ives?

05:14.782 --> 05:17.050
-Only a matter of time.
-How much time?

05:19.920 --> 05:22.122
-How much time I got?
-Not a lot.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.524
The AG
didn't appreciate you

05:23.624 --> 05:25.225
leaking news
of your investigation.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.561
I didn't leak it.
I denied it when asked.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.297
Okay. You've lodged official
protest of my statement.

05:30.398 --> 05:32.366
Say what you came to say.

05:32.466 --> 05:35.235
You're alive as long
as you're making progress.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.937
But the AG thinks
that you stalled,

05:37.037 --> 05:39.673
she's gonna show you
the Hans Gruber Memorial Exit.

05:41.509 --> 05:44.011
Well, it's nice to hear you
take the potential demise

05:44.111 --> 05:46.480
of my career so seriously.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.416
Laugh or cry.
You know what I mean?

05:48.516 --> 05:50.918
I sure do.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.723
* tense music *

06:04.665 --> 06:05.899
Get me Bensinger.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.669
Very few things get the third
wealthiest man in America

06:08.769 --> 06:09.970
- to leave home.

06:10.070 --> 06:12.172
A handful
of economic conferences

06:12.272 --> 06:14.775
and reeling in billionaires
for the Giving Oath.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.176
No conferences are happening

06:16.276 --> 06:17.978
in the city right now,
Mr. Bensinger.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.680
Well done, young man.

06:19.780 --> 06:22.616
If your publication
will grant me a 48-hour hold,

06:22.716 --> 06:24.184
I'll give you
a head start.

06:24.284 --> 06:26.153
Of course.

06:26.253 --> 06:28.556
Richard Winstead
is joining us

06:28.656 --> 06:31.058
and pledging
80% of his assets.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.627
It's a great act
of philanthropy.

06:36.964 --> 06:38.832
Excuse me.

06:41.101 --> 06:43.270
Robert.
A rare treat.

06:43.370 --> 06:45.939
Can you find some time for me
while you're visiting?

06:46.039 --> 06:47.140
The city's so noisy.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.709
If you want
to have a real talk,

06:48.809 --> 06:50.478
come to the house
in Shaker Heights.

06:50.578 --> 06:53.246
That's a kind offer, but I
don't want to wait that long.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.615
What are you doing tonight?

06:54.715 --> 06:56.784
Bridge game,
grabbing a hot dog.

06:56.884 --> 06:58.452
So, the usual?

06:58.552 --> 07:00.554
If I know you,
you're gonna stop at a cart,

07:00.654 --> 07:03.457
or, even worse,
order room service.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.826
New York is,
in some respects, a fine city,

07:05.926 --> 07:07.795
but not where cased meats
are concerned.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.797
I got a place.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.298
I think it
more than stacks up

07:11.398 --> 07:12.966
against what you got
in Cleveland.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.536
Challenge accepted.
I'll see you tonight.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.741
It doesn't matter what I do.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.342
The faucet's run dry.

07:22.442 --> 07:23.911
What does that mean?

07:24.011 --> 07:25.713
I can't get anything
on Spartan-Ives'

07:25.813 --> 07:27.481
Treasury bid-rigging
'cause there is

07:27.581 --> 07:29.416
no Spartan-Ives'
Treasury bid-rigging.

07:29.517 --> 07:32.152
That's bullshit.
We all know it's happening.

07:32.252 --> 07:35.122
It was, till news got out that
you guys were targeting them,

07:35.222 --> 07:36.557
and then they just,
you know.

07:36.657 --> 07:39.326
Boyd's snake
crawled back up his flap.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.829
Look, I don't know
what I'm supposed to do here.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.665
I can't share a bed
with my wife.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.901
I can't move out, 'cause
then she'll know that I know.

07:48.001 --> 07:50.237
I spend half my day at home
in the bathroom.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.639
She thinks I have the shits.

07:51.739 --> 07:53.440
Look, I don't think
I'm gonna be able

07:53.541 --> 07:55.275
to help you get Boyd.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.210
I mean, I want to,
but --

07:57.310 --> 08:01.549
Your boss violated the sanctity
of your marital bed,

08:01.649 --> 08:03.316
and you can't man up to --

08:03.416 --> 08:04.718
Bryan.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.520
He's all man.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.990
He's John Wayne
in Liberty Valance.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.860
'Cause most fellas in
his position would run and hide,

08:12.960 --> 08:14.828
but he is standing in.

08:14.928 --> 08:17.164
Now, I don't know
if I'd be man enough

08:17.264 --> 08:21.168
to watch my wife sleep next
to me, knowing what he knows.

08:21.268 --> 08:25.372
Mr. McKinnon,
a bit more time,

08:25.472 --> 08:27.841
and your struggle
will have been worth it.

08:27.941 --> 08:29.342
Players return to their mean.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.611
And we will be waiting.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.648
Get back to work.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.617
Keep it together.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.519
We'll find another way
to nail Lawrence Boyd,

08:39.620 --> 08:40.554
and when we do,

08:40.654 --> 08:41.722
we'll need you.

08:51.565 --> 08:53.767
Setback.
Not a defeat.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.304
I promise.

09:01.408 --> 09:04.077
I could go through
the Panama Papers,

09:04.177 --> 09:06.714
look at all the assets
that offshore firm was hiding.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.481
Boyd didn't have
money there.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.950
There's no direct link
to him.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.586
Maybe we'll find someone else
to flip up the chain.

09:12.686 --> 09:16.256
The problem isn't
the missing link to the top.

09:16.356 --> 09:18.759
The problem is the top.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.861
* suspenseful music *

09:26.767 --> 09:28.636
-Your friend Lawrence Boyd.
-Mm-hmm.

09:28.736 --> 09:29.870
You said he was ready.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.038
Fuck.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.940
There's a methodology
I deploy

09:33.040 --> 09:35.508
that gets the results
you've come to expect.

09:35.609 --> 09:39.212
But he isn't letting me take
the steps I need to.

09:39.312 --> 09:42.182
Do you want me to take actions
I deem necessary

09:42.282 --> 09:43.416
without his approval?

09:43.516 --> 09:45.052
No, keep offering help.

09:45.152 --> 09:49.389
If he's too genteel to accept,
there's nothing we can do.

09:50.490 --> 09:53.627
Whose house?

09:53.727 --> 09:56.229
Whose house?

09:56.329 --> 09:57.931
- Lonnie's house.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.833
All right.

09:59.933 --> 10:00.834
Whose house?

10:00.934 --> 10:02.602
I'm not fucking saying it.

10:02.703 --> 10:04.004
Aw,
you're breaking my heart,

10:04.104 --> 10:06.039
but whether you admit it
or not,

10:06.139 --> 10:08.241
it is, in fact...

10:08.341 --> 10:10.010
Lonnie's house.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.079
You did not
just close another one.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.882
Yeah. Predator this week,
Panamanian drug lord last week,

10:14.982 --> 10:16.717
but who's keeping score?

10:16.817 --> 10:19.586
Uh, by the way, how's that
whole Spartan-Ives thing going?

10:19.687 --> 10:20.954
Solid.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.956
Great.

10:25.993 --> 10:27.560
Hey, there.

10:35.202 --> 10:36.103
New look?

10:36.203 --> 10:38.105
Oh.
The wife.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.272
Understood.

10:39.372 --> 10:41.809
Rhoades' motion to dismiss
was denied.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.576
Boom! Body shot!

10:43.677 --> 10:45.846
Deposition's confirmed
for Thursday,

10:45.946 --> 10:48.381
but we should postpone.

10:48.481 --> 10:49.582
Oh, yeah. I know.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.785
That's what I would say
were I my own lawyer.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.621
Yet we press on.

10:54.722 --> 10:57.791
If he doesn't get to depose me,
I don't get to depose him.

10:57.891 --> 10:58.892
It has to happen now.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.494
Ah. The NFL.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.496
I heard you were down
to the final three.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.966
Yeah. Even for me,
this kind of chance?

11:06.066 --> 11:07.634
I know.
Of course.

11:07.735 --> 11:11.271
Most folks, when they get
their first job on the Street,

11:11.371 --> 11:13.106
cold-calling
out of phone books,

11:13.206 --> 11:16.710
they think the idea is,
get the mark to yes.

11:16.810 --> 11:20.680
But the way I saw it -- and it
bought me a 911 my first year --

11:20.781 --> 11:23.250
is never give them
a reason to say no,

11:23.350 --> 11:26.319
because if you take "no"
out of their vocabulary...

11:26.419 --> 11:28.221
"Yes" is
the only word left.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.724
And right now,
Chuck Rhoades' accusations,

11:30.824 --> 11:34.227
his insinuations --
That's their no...

11:34.327 --> 11:37.097
unless I can make it clear

11:37.197 --> 11:39.232
he was the one
who crossed the line.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.668
You have
to know going in --

11:41.769 --> 11:44.637
Depositions are
unpredictable beasts.

11:44.738 --> 11:47.274
In depos, I've seen things
you wouldn't believe.

11:47.374 --> 11:48.742
Attack ships on fire?

11:48.842 --> 11:52.512
Yes. The very best cases
gone forever,

11:52.612 --> 11:54.181
like tears in rain.

11:54.281 --> 11:58.285
No replicant... no lawyer
is gonna rattle me.

11:59.920 --> 12:04.124
Mr. Axelrod, you say
the U.S. attorney harassed you,

12:04.224 --> 12:06.726
that he overstepped
the bounds of his office.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.962
Are you sure he didn't have
legitimate reason

12:09.062 --> 12:10.630
to come
to your place of business?

12:10.730 --> 12:11.899
At that hour? No.

12:11.999 --> 12:13.200
His wife worked for you.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.868
Could have been coming
to see her.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.469
His wife
had quit working for me.

12:16.569 --> 12:17.971
She'd also quit
being his wife.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.306
Don't be cute.

12:19.406 --> 12:21.775
If you want this to help you
in the PR department,

12:21.875 --> 12:23.176
keep the digs
off the record.

12:23.276 --> 12:24.477
What about Mick Danzig?

12:24.577 --> 12:26.980
Do you deny bribing police
to wipe out his arrest?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.882
Of course.
I would nev--

12:28.982 --> 12:31.718
Fuck.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.220
Yeah.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.755
Let's not give him
a perjury charge for nothing.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.726
I know you don't get rattled,
but if you get rattled,

12:39.827 --> 12:43.230
even for a second,
don't answer.

12:43.330 --> 12:45.365
Just ask for a break.

12:48.501 --> 12:51.338
So...
you want a break now?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.640
Keep 'em coming.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.312
That's the shaker room.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.150
I don't see a lot
of Amish furniture in there.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.953
That's funny.
I like jokes.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.822
No, it's where metallurgy
gets subjected

13:08.922 --> 13:11.691
to the speed and pressure
it'll face in space.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.426
It's where things
tend to break.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.928
Why do you want
to go up there?

13:15.028 --> 13:17.130
It's
the undiscovered country.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.367
Hmm.
That's from Hamlet.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.269
He was describing death.

13:22.369 --> 13:25.272
It's the final frontier.

13:25.372 --> 13:27.908
How about in your own words?

13:34.247 --> 13:37.250
Everyone I went to school with
works on one of two things --

13:37.350 --> 13:41.088
theoretical particle physics
or the next great start-up.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.822
You don't care
about those things?

13:42.923 --> 13:45.125
I have too much self-respect
to be an academic,

13:45.225 --> 13:46.994
so number one is out.

13:47.094 --> 13:50.730
And the pure money grab,
while intoxicating in theory,

13:50.830 --> 13:53.566
never seems to leave anyone
any better off than they were

13:53.666 --> 13:57.270
the moment they had the big idea
in the first place...

13:57.370 --> 13:59.372
because they are
still stuck here,

13:59.472 --> 14:01.808
bound to this place
and its limitations

14:01.909 --> 14:05.745
of fuel, space,
and class struggle.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.748
Face it --
Earth is pretty screwed.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.721
Where does that leave you?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.394
I want to do
something impossible.

14:21.494 --> 14:25.933
I want to point to the sky,
at another planet,

14:26.033 --> 14:29.636
and say,
"I used to live there."

14:31.871 --> 14:34.607
I don't think
I've said that out loud before.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.110
Does it sound silly?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.245
No.

14:43.850 --> 14:46.019
Following Axelrod's
a nonstarter.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.220
Why?

14:47.320 --> 14:48.855
He's got operatives, pros --

14:48.956 --> 14:49.889
with him, on him.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.058
They hang back.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.526
His own staff probably
doesn't know they're there,

14:53.626 --> 14:54.661
but they are.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.930
I saw a guy I used to
work with at the Bureau.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.798
Quality agent.
Lucky he didn't see me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.301
This would be much easier
for your son to assign --

15:01.401 --> 15:02.335
No, no.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.137
This has
nothing to do with him.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.006
He can't even know
about it.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.507
Understood.

15:07.607 --> 15:09.376
Maybe you don't
personally do it.

15:09.476 --> 15:10.944
No.
They'd make anybody.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.314
They're squared away.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.848
Drop down a rung.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.117
Follow his top people.

15:17.217 --> 15:19.319
Okay.

15:19.419 --> 15:23.356
And this... is for you.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.425
Results on the other subject.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.128
Surveillance of a federal
employee is a Class E felony,

15:28.228 --> 15:29.696
so if you want me
to keep it up,

15:29.796 --> 15:31.931
I'm gonna need
to charge you a higher rate.

15:32.032 --> 15:34.467
Then it's a good day
for business.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.241
Yes?

15:41.341 --> 15:43.510
Your father's driver
dropped this off for you.

15:43.610 --> 15:46.046
Oh.

15:46.146 --> 15:49.816
* brooding music *

15:59.226 --> 16:02.996
-Thanks, man.
-For you, Bryan, anything.

16:03.096 --> 16:05.165
That coffee is terrible.

16:05.265 --> 16:06.799
How do you drink it?

16:10.237 --> 16:13.006
I close my eyes
and think of England.

16:13.106 --> 16:16.543
When you close your eyes,
I want you to think of me.

16:17.944 --> 16:19.012
Coming after you.

16:19.112 --> 16:21.214
Like my own personal
Anton Chigurh?

16:21.314 --> 16:25.452
Oh, no. I'm not
some surrealist nightmare.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.520
I'm flesh and blood.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.357
I feel like you've got
some bedrock misunderstandings

16:30.457 --> 16:31.558
about government work.

16:31.658 --> 16:35.528
The Spartan-Ives investigation
isn't going anywhere.

16:35.628 --> 16:39.899
It's not going
to save Chuck's job.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.337
Who told you that?

16:44.437 --> 16:47.407
Don't throw away
a promising career

16:47.507 --> 16:51.444
over a selective
and misguided sense of loyalty.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.213
Your boss is going down,

16:53.313 --> 16:56.383
so why not finish Chuck off
yourself

16:56.483 --> 16:59.386
and earn some Justice points
with the deathblow?

17:16.436 --> 17:18.571
So, we're finally
gonna have the talk?

17:18.671 --> 17:22.242
Well, you've been reaching out
to me for five years.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.678
This isn't
how I like to do it.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.447
You prefer the house?

17:27.547 --> 17:28.548
It's more intimate.

17:28.648 --> 17:29.916
For a seduction?

17:30.016 --> 17:33.220
When you ask a person
to invest his money with you,

17:33.320 --> 17:34.921
that's a seduction.

17:35.021 --> 17:37.023
When you ask him
to pledge his net worth --

17:37.124 --> 17:39.726
That's what the Mongols did
when they sacked a village.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.528
I was gonna say
it's a marriage.

17:41.628 --> 17:44.464
Well, the Mongols
called it that, too.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.633
Look, I get
why you've been putting me off.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.067
Most people don't like

17:48.168 --> 17:50.537
to think about giving
their money away.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.905
It makes them think
they're gonna die.

17:53.005 --> 17:57.177
But you can rest assured --
You are gonna die.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.146
Yes.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.348
A man
tries a lot of things.

18:01.448 --> 18:04.784
He fucks, he fathers,
he letters his name

18:04.884 --> 18:07.720
above doorways he'd never
otherwise walk through.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.289
Any of this sound familiar?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.825
How's your hot dog?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.128
Goddamn delicious.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.896
Why do
you make so much money?

18:16.996 --> 18:18.831
Because I can.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.099
Bullshit.

18:20.200 --> 18:22.635
A lot of things you can do
that you don't --

18:22.735 --> 18:25.372
bark like a seal,
ride the subway.

18:25.472 --> 18:28.341
You make money
because it feels good.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.677
Well, here's
the crazy thing.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.879
Giving it away
feels better.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.618
Do you remember what it felt
like to make that first million?

18:40.753 --> 18:42.455
I didn't feel
that good again

18:42.555 --> 18:46.793
until I pledged to give away
20,000 times that.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.529
It's the cure.

18:49.629 --> 18:53.300
Accumulation with no end
in sight is gluttony.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.967
That's the disease.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.669
I thought it was a sin.

18:56.769 --> 18:58.438
Fuck sin.
Fuck piety.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.440
I'm talking
about what you can use.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.175
Gluttony hollows you out.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.076
Giving goes the other way.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.480
I know. It's a fucking paradox,
but I worked it out.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.817
The reason that nothing levers
up your happiness like giving

19:10.917 --> 19:13.720
is because it puts you back
in charge of the only thing

19:13.820 --> 19:18.625
that you ever really
cared about -- yourself.

19:18.725 --> 19:20.893
That's why I founded
the Giving Oath.

19:23.062 --> 19:26.132
And that's
why I'm sitting here.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.509
Aw.

19:36.609 --> 19:38.611
Fuck.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.984
I like the way you fight
to pass my guard,

19:45.084 --> 19:48.087
but you practically dove
into that arm lock.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.889
You've got to learn
the difference

19:49.989 --> 19:53.059
between naive aggression
and effective aggression.

19:53.159 --> 19:56.028
Yeah.

20:12.512 --> 20:14.113
Yeah?

20:15.382 --> 20:18.685
That's not what you were
wearing at the office.

20:18.785 --> 20:20.219
No.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.424
I found something.

20:24.524 --> 20:26.393
I was looking through
the Panama Papers.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.160
There was a link to Boyd,
after all?

20:28.261 --> 20:30.597
No.
He's not hiding money there.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.334
Your father is.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.105
That's what couldn't wait
till morning?

20:39.205 --> 20:42.208
No. He stashed $12 million
in an offshore account.

20:42.309 --> 20:43.843
I know.

20:45.278 --> 20:47.314
You knew about this?

20:47.414 --> 20:49.181
He didn't do
anything illegal.

20:49.282 --> 20:50.650
He didn't stash it.

20:50.750 --> 20:53.453
Moving money that way
is not a crime.

20:53.553 --> 20:55.322
It's just bad PR.

20:57.223 --> 21:00.327
But what is it that
really bothers you, Bryan?

21:00.427 --> 21:01.861
The fact
that he hid the money

21:01.961 --> 21:05.298
or the fact that he had
that much in the first place?

21:11.037 --> 21:12.705
* suspenseful music *

21:12.805 --> 21:13.940
Here it is.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.675
No, not that one.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.510
The Carolina sauces
are too vinegary.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.379
I want something spicy.

21:19.479 --> 21:22.382
I'm sick
of the barbecue sauce.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.984
So, Wags?

21:25.084 --> 21:26.486
Hitting it hard.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.988
He has a standing appointment
every morning.

21:29.088 --> 21:31.157
He has his own IV stand
in his room.

21:31.257 --> 21:33.526
Yeah,
he's fucked right now.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.261
I'll deal with it soon.

21:36.596 --> 21:38.598
He showed me this.

21:38.698 --> 21:42.034
Says it came
to his work e-mail.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.571
It's Dan Wolfe's company.

21:44.671 --> 21:46.839
Private equity guy
who invests in healthcare.

21:46.939 --> 21:49.141
They've got real money
behind them.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.411
Well, they're hitting
on our customer base now

21:51.511 --> 21:53.012
and undercutting us.

21:53.112 --> 21:57.283
So I was thinking we change
our focus to smaller firms,

21:57.384 --> 21:59.185
maybe out in New Jersey.

21:59.285 --> 22:00.653
Yeah, let's let him
bigfoot us

22:00.753 --> 22:03.423
into becoming, like, a lovely
little boutique, you know?

22:03.523 --> 22:05.057
We can open
a bed-and-breakfast

22:05.157 --> 22:08.127
and serve intravenous
maple syrup to our guests.

22:08.227 --> 22:09.562
You want to fight?

22:09.662 --> 22:12.231
This is our fucking corner,
Stringer.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.938
Yellowbird.

22:20.407 --> 22:23.476
You are going to obtain
and execute

22:23.576 --> 22:25.778
a search warrant
for Spartan-Ives.

22:25.878 --> 22:27.380
What's the basis
for the warrant?

22:27.480 --> 22:28.648
Quote stuffing.

22:28.748 --> 22:30.650
I brought you that a year ago.

22:30.750 --> 22:33.085
You called me a piker
for wanting to go after it.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.887
Yeah, you said
high-frequency trading

22:34.987 --> 22:37.056
confuses juries
more than advanced calculus.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.591
It is advanced calculus.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.561
This is the first wave
at Normandy.

22:41.661 --> 22:43.596
You know what happened
on the first wave.

22:43.696 --> 22:45.698
-Got cut down.
-Right.

22:45.798 --> 22:49.135
Ensuring that the second wave
had a fighting chance.

22:49.235 --> 22:51.170
Judge Wailand
is expecting you,

22:51.270 --> 22:55.274
so go make like a piker --

22:55.374 --> 22:56.909
today.

22:58.344 --> 22:59.579
Hey.

22:59.679 --> 23:00.947
Hey.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.381
Miss me that much?

23:02.482 --> 23:03.783
Hm, yeah.

23:03.883 --> 23:06.152
And I wanted to talk
to a few of your employees,

23:06.252 --> 23:07.454
who are also my clients.

23:07.554 --> 23:08.855
Sure. Why?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.624
Just to gauge their experience
and overall satisfaction.

23:11.724 --> 23:15.528
So, you didn't want
to see if they or you

23:15.628 --> 23:18.865
are being specifically targeted
by Dan Wolfe's Mercy Squad?

23:18.965 --> 23:20.567
I am, right?

23:21.801 --> 23:24.103
-Fuck.
-It's okay.

23:24.203 --> 23:26.038
I'll call Wolfe,
ask for some courtesy,

23:26.138 --> 23:27.106
have him back off.

23:27.206 --> 23:29.776
You will not.
I'll handle it.

23:29.876 --> 23:31.110
How?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.412
I'm a businesswoman.
I'll handle it.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.019
You signed up
for the Giving Oath?

23:40.119 --> 23:42.088
You've gone soft.
How much are you giving?

23:42.188 --> 23:45.592
Nobody needs to know
what he does or doesn't do.

23:45.692 --> 23:47.694
The giving is later.
The headlines are now.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.896
You planted it...
so you'd look like the type

23:49.996 --> 23:52.999
of charity-minded champion that
gets to steward a sacred trust,

23:53.099 --> 23:54.366
like a sports franchise.

23:54.467 --> 23:57.570
Didn't want to just sit back
and leave it to the gods.

23:59.772 --> 24:01.941
* tense music *

24:02.041 --> 24:03.442
It worked.
I mean, you got me.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.677
Yeah.

24:04.777 --> 24:07.113
But you've
also been hitting the IV

24:07.213 --> 24:09.215
- a little hard lately.

24:09.315 --> 24:11.651
I barely touch the stuff.

24:13.352 --> 24:15.321
Every day.

24:16.689 --> 24:18.725
* suspenseful music *

24:22.962 --> 24:26.098
Do you believe
Chuck really has this?

24:26.198 --> 24:27.534
That, or he's losing it.

24:27.634 --> 24:29.602
Either way
is good for you.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.871
So smile.
Enjoy it.

24:33.405 --> 24:36.809
You're really okay
with leaving Earth behind?

24:36.909 --> 24:39.846
Leaving your family behind,
potentially forever?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.849
I'm an only child.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.383
Was that lonely or...

24:44.483 --> 24:48.054
It was ideal, in the truest
sense of that word.

24:48.154 --> 24:49.556
Because I could deploy
language

24:49.656 --> 24:51.357
from
an early developmental stage,

24:51.457 --> 24:53.392
we all got really
used to talking.

24:53.492 --> 24:55.695
Oh.
That must have been nice.

24:55.795 --> 24:57.363
We communicated
in my family, too,

24:57.463 --> 24:59.732
but there were more of us,
and most of the time,

24:59.832 --> 25:02.001
it wasn't conversation
with a capital C.

25:02.101 --> 25:04.370
It's hard to find people
you could just...

25:05.204 --> 25:06.472
Do you --

25:06.573 --> 25:09.141
This may sound like a weird
non-answer-question thing,

25:09.241 --> 25:10.376
but do you like Wilco?

25:10.476 --> 25:11.711
Yeah.

25:11.811 --> 25:15.381
Yes, I love the one
with "Jesus, don't cry."

25:15.481 --> 25:18.250
Yeah, me too,
because in that one,

25:18.350 --> 25:19.686
Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett

25:19.786 --> 25:22.655
had found in each other
a perfect mind meld.

25:22.755 --> 25:25.057
They communicated
on a level few ever reach.

25:25.157 --> 25:28.460
But the thing about Wilco
in that moment is,

25:28.561 --> 25:30.329
it was
never that good again.

25:30.429 --> 25:31.497
Bennett left the group.

25:31.598 --> 25:33.132
Somehow,
even though each had

25:33.232 --> 25:35.234
to know
the other made him better,

25:35.334 --> 25:37.837
they just couldn't find a way
to keep going together.

25:37.937 --> 25:39.538
Did the band break up?

25:39.639 --> 25:42.241
No. Even without Bennett,
Wilco was Wilco.

25:42.341 --> 25:43.409
It kept trucking along.

25:43.509 --> 25:44.944
And Bennett?

25:45.044 --> 25:48.648
He died,
just a couple years later.

25:48.748 --> 25:49.949
He OD'd.

25:50.049 --> 25:54.386
Somehow, on his own,
he couldn't keep it together.

25:54.486 --> 25:57.489
Makes you wonder
how you can find a true partner

25:57.590 --> 25:59.291
and keep them.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.996
Who is that person
for you?

26:08.668 --> 26:10.269
You've never found them.

26:14.073 --> 26:15.642
You've never looked.

26:15.742 --> 26:18.277
If things got messy,

26:18.377 --> 26:20.446
I wasn't sure
I could keep trucking.

26:20.546 --> 26:22.749
You didn't want a relationship
holding you back

26:22.849 --> 26:24.450
from doing
what you love most.

26:24.550 --> 26:28.054
Yeah, that's...

26:28.154 --> 26:30.389
Yeah.

26:30.489 --> 26:32.792
Thank you
for talking to me.

26:32.892 --> 26:34.226
That's it?

26:34.326 --> 26:36.495
That's it.

26:38.564 --> 26:40.967
My dad taught me.

26:41.067 --> 26:44.003
He knew I'd always be
competing against men.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.505
Wanted me to have
some measure of control.

26:46.605 --> 26:49.876
You're gonna do
great things.

26:53.946 --> 26:58.985
Whatever you heard in that
meeting made you squeamish.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.153
You know what Rhoades is,
Bryan.

27:01.253 --> 27:04.290
You know
he should be out of a job.

27:04.390 --> 27:08.360
And I know
you made that call.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.141
You rang, boss?

27:39.358 --> 27:42.729
I need you to reach out to Boyd
and set up a meeting.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.897
Just the two of you?

27:44.997 --> 27:46.098
Mm-hmm.

27:49.268 --> 27:51.570
This is what the warrant
was setting up.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.039
Second wave.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.909
Where's the meeting?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.078
Not in our offices.
We're not there yet.

27:59.178 --> 28:03.415
No.
No, he picks the spot.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.718
I come to him.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.486
I even ask him
for something.

28:07.586 --> 28:10.656
Trying to hoist him
on his own --

28:10.757 --> 28:13.926
No. It doesn't matter
what I ask for.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.799
You know, the best way
to bond with someone

28:19.899 --> 28:21.367
isn't doing a favor.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.135
It's asking for one.

28:23.235 --> 28:24.670
That's the Franklin Effect.

28:24.771 --> 28:26.973
You make the other person
feel valued,

28:27.073 --> 28:28.741
like you've
given them power...

28:28.841 --> 28:30.276
so you won't hurt them.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.379
Now, that's how I need Boyd
to feel.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.317
* suspenseful music *

28:42.254 --> 28:44.556
Now, isn't this
a literary club?

28:44.656 --> 28:45.858
I've written a book --

28:45.958 --> 28:47.459
"Steady at the Helm."

28:47.559 --> 28:48.727
Sure.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.797
I tore through it
in one sitting.

28:50.897 --> 28:52.865
The club motto
actually comes from a poem.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.100
Mm.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.069
"In the afternoon,
they came unto a land..."

28:57.169 --> 28:59.638
Where they assumed
a supine position

28:59.738 --> 29:02.141
and sucked
each other's dicks.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.410
That's Tennyson, right?

29:04.510 --> 29:07.146
More or less.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.580
What's the topic, Chuck?

29:10.682 --> 29:14.286
The state of war we're in

29:14.386 --> 29:15.988
and what you can do
to end it.

29:16.088 --> 29:18.190
I don't write
polite letters.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.326
I don't like
to plea-bargain.

29:20.426 --> 29:21.627
I like to fight.

29:21.727 --> 29:24.563
You sure you want to take
life advice from Roy Cohn?

29:24.663 --> 29:28.667
He got things done,
and he was a generous man.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.804
Mentored Trump,
mentored me.

29:31.904 --> 29:34.073
What have you grown
in your shade?

29:34.173 --> 29:38.344
I have all the king's men
arrayed behind me.

29:38.444 --> 29:41.747
And yet a tentative hold
on your commission.

29:41.848 --> 29:45.484
Yes, the AG
is not very happy with me,

29:45.584 --> 29:48.620
yet she seems to like you
for some reason.

29:48.720 --> 29:52.058
Maybe because
I don't turn a man's house

29:52.158 --> 29:53.625
upside down for nothing

29:53.725 --> 29:55.761
just so other people
will look at me.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.401
You're right.

30:02.501 --> 30:06.906
I don't have much
on Spartan-Ives.

30:07.006 --> 30:08.540
I'm here to ask a favor.

30:15.081 --> 30:18.885
You have
a strong compliance department.

30:18.985 --> 30:24.156
I was hoping that you might put
on an internal investigation.

30:24.256 --> 30:27.359
Make it look like you're
responding to my pressure.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.395
Why would I do that?

30:29.495 --> 30:32.164
Because,
after a year or so,

30:32.264 --> 30:35.001
when your investigation
is over,

30:35.101 --> 30:36.702
my office signs off on it.

30:36.802 --> 30:39.972
I declare
I've cleaned up Wall Street,

30:40.072 --> 30:43.675
and you crow about how you've
swept the rogue elements

30:43.775 --> 30:46.278
out of your own shop.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.680
It's a win all around.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.983
Not if I have
to wait a year.

30:51.083 --> 30:54.153
I want to get out
from under this immediately.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.787
I am not taking this
with me

30:55.888 --> 30:58.390
on the boat off Antibes
this summer.

31:01.760 --> 31:03.595
Then what can you
give me now?

31:05.431 --> 31:07.499
How about this?

31:07.599 --> 31:09.601
There are
a few mid-level guys

31:09.701 --> 31:12.704
my compliance department
has flagged.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.273
What if I sacrifice them?

31:15.674 --> 31:18.978
Well, that might give me
the cloak I need to move on.

31:21.180 --> 31:23.950
Yeah. And you would get
to fire them for cause

31:24.050 --> 31:25.584
and save
three months' severance.

31:25.684 --> 31:26.885
Six.

31:26.986 --> 31:30.056
You are munificent.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.692
And thank you.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.827
Have your guy call mine.

31:35.928 --> 31:38.564
They can coordinate
press releases.

31:52.778 --> 31:55.314
All right,
90-second cool down.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.418
Go.

31:59.518 --> 32:01.320
Rachman pulled his bid
for the team.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.956
Couldn't afford it or knew
it was going another way?

32:04.056 --> 32:06.492
Someone let the league know
about his FCPA issues,

32:06.592 --> 32:09.261
and with you and Bensinger
splashed all over the papers,

32:09.361 --> 32:11.463
he didn't want
to drown in your rising tide.

32:11.563 --> 32:14.066
There's only one other bidder
left, and it's a group.

32:14.166 --> 32:15.401
He can't afford it solo.

32:15.501 --> 32:17.836
* Are you ready
for some football? *

32:17.936 --> 32:19.371
Yes, I am.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.107
Let's finish this.

32:21.207 --> 32:22.975
Will you draft
the Giving Oath letter?

32:23.075 --> 32:25.277
-What do you want in there?
-The usual stuff --

32:25.377 --> 32:27.179
-good for people, communities.
-Got it.

32:27.279 --> 32:30.182
And when it's done, you give it
to Bill to read to the world.

32:30.282 --> 32:31.183
Gates or Clinton?

32:31.283 --> 32:32.551
Either.

32:32.651 --> 32:35.021
Both.

32:37.356 --> 32:40.792
You always were
a fucking pisser, Lara.

32:40.892 --> 32:43.029
Little
Lara fucking Benjamin.

32:43.129 --> 32:44.430
She's not Benjamin
anymore.

32:44.530 --> 32:45.998
She's aristocratic now.

32:46.098 --> 32:48.867
No.
What I'm not is little.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.669
I'm all grown up.

32:50.769 --> 32:53.005
You serious about this?

32:53.105 --> 32:54.606
Can you hook it up?

32:54.706 --> 32:56.942
Sure.
I know just the right girl.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.445
I think she graduated,
she's certified, everything.

32:59.545 --> 33:01.147
I don't think
she passed the test.

33:01.247 --> 33:04.050
Either way,
she's the right girl.

33:04.150 --> 33:05.217
Mercy Squad?

33:05.317 --> 33:08.154
Yeah,
that's what it's called,

33:08.254 --> 33:11.357
but I need it to stay
all the way quiet.

33:11.457 --> 33:14.660
* And let the truth be told *

33:14.760 --> 33:16.295
Hey, no, no, no, no.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.496
You're family.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.098
To pay the girl.

33:22.368 --> 33:23.369
Okay.

33:24.803 --> 33:27.005
Anything
for Dean's little sister.

33:27.106 --> 33:29.441
To Dean.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.910
* Whoo-hoo *

33:32.010 --> 33:34.546
* Hey, hey,
I got to pick myself up... *

33:38.950 --> 33:41.187
Rhoades reached out to me.

33:41.287 --> 33:44.556
Did you cut off his hand?

33:47.693 --> 33:49.395
You did the other thing.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.030
You would have cut off
his hand, right?

33:52.131 --> 33:55.534
That's me.

33:57.303 --> 33:59.971
I have another source I can
check to be sure it's legit.

34:00.072 --> 34:02.007
I'll be careful.

34:02.108 --> 34:03.275
You better be.

34:05.677 --> 34:08.747
Your advice was appreciated,
and it wasn't wrong,

34:08.847 --> 34:10.649
but ask a barber
if you need a haircut,

34:10.749 --> 34:12.384
he's always gonna say yes.

34:12.484 --> 34:14.953
I asked a warrior.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.389
But not everyone out there's
a savage.

34:17.489 --> 34:20.459
Rhoades opened his eyes
to the bigger picture.

34:32.504 --> 34:34.072
Are we playing it too safe?

34:34.173 --> 34:35.841
These are
just the initial questions

34:35.941 --> 34:37.376
I'm gonna be asking Axe.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.045
I'm giving him a little Rumble
in the Jungle at first.

34:40.146 --> 34:41.313
Bomaye.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.081
Yeah.
I'm gonna do all that,

34:43.182 --> 34:45.451
you understand,
at the deposition.

34:45.551 --> 34:48.587
But I got to say it again --
You shouldn't come.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.922
It should be cold,
clinical.

34:51.022 --> 34:52.658
You're worried
I'll say something.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.660
Yes, I am.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.094
Anything unscripted
from you

34:56.195 --> 34:57.896
could put you
in an even deeper hole.

34:57.996 --> 34:59.265
I won't say a word.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.400
Well, then, why come?

35:01.500 --> 35:03.802
Trust me,
it'll have value.

35:03.902 --> 35:06.838
My mere presence
will make Axelrod stumble.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.740
It's too risky.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.042
I don't want the whole thing
becoming a circus.

35:11.143 --> 35:13.179
Just let me bore him
into fucking up.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.381
Come!

35:16.382 --> 35:18.049
I'm sorry.
I thought you were alone.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.452
That's okay.
I could use a cup of coffee.

35:27.759 --> 35:29.628
What's on your mind?

35:34.533 --> 35:36.702
My father.

35:36.802 --> 35:38.637
What happened?

35:38.737 --> 35:41.039
He isn't who I thought.

35:41.139 --> 35:44.610
Well, every child
in the history of the world

35:44.710 --> 35:45.677
has learned that.

35:45.777 --> 35:46.712
I'm not naive.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.480
No, never thought you were.

35:48.580 --> 35:51.250
But when he gave me advice,

35:51.350 --> 35:54.820
I looked at it
through a certain prism...

35:54.920 --> 35:57.423
knowing
that he had integrity.

35:59.258 --> 36:00.959
Now I...

36:01.059 --> 36:04.896
I find out he has
a pile of money offshore.

36:06.432 --> 36:08.534
Legal tax avoidance,

36:08.634 --> 36:12.003
but he has
always sold himself to me

36:12.103 --> 36:14.139
as somebody
who doesn't avoid.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.007
Mm.

36:18.710 --> 36:20.912
Don't be so hard
on your old man.

36:24.416 --> 36:27.353
Reach out to him.

36:27.453 --> 36:29.988
Don't keep
the disappointment inside.

36:30.088 --> 36:32.258
Let him know what's going on.

36:36.428 --> 36:42.834
So, you got a few sacrificial
Spartan-Ives shitheads

36:42.934 --> 36:45.437
that nobody had heard of
yesterday

36:45.537 --> 36:48.307
and nobody will remember
tomorrow.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.609
You sure that's enough
to save your job?

36:51.943 --> 36:54.513
But be careful,
'cause that kind of directness

36:54.613 --> 36:56.282
is a change of pace.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.817
I did the best I could.

36:58.917 --> 37:00.519
That's what
there was to get.

37:00.619 --> 37:02.521
It can't be where you live.

37:02.621 --> 37:05.524
You'll need
to keep going after Boyd.

37:05.624 --> 37:09.795
No. You can't get blood
from a C.E.O.

37:09.895 --> 37:12.664
If I'm out of a job,
then I can finally earn

37:12.764 --> 37:17.035
some of that money
everyone's always talking about.

37:17.135 --> 37:18.337
Okay, sonny.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.174
I'm sure
you know what you're doing.

37:25.511 --> 37:27.012
Mmm.

37:31.483 --> 37:34.586
You have to protect
the parent-child relationship.

37:34.686 --> 37:40.125
Anyone else in the world
will fuck you over --

37:40.225 --> 37:42.561
friends, lovers...

37:42.661 --> 37:43.795
bosses.

37:48.967 --> 37:52.170
No, your father
is the one person

37:52.270 --> 37:56.274
you're gonna be able
to count on when it matters.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.682
Soft 6?

38:03.782 --> 38:06.818
No.
You can swing free.

38:11.423 --> 38:15.260
You can swing free,
and not just here.

38:15.361 --> 38:17.162
Chuck meant what he said.

38:19.631 --> 38:21.333
The investigation's over?

38:23.669 --> 38:26.805
And you'll put in a word
for him with the AG?

38:28.540 --> 38:30.876
He's showing a real awareness
of the landscape.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.110
You must be proud.

38:32.210 --> 38:34.646
I've always been proud.

38:34.746 --> 38:36.715
Now I'm happy for him.

38:45.557 --> 38:47.459
Elena's brilliant...

38:47.559 --> 38:49.461
ideal for research...

38:51.062 --> 38:52.931
...but not a fit
for the program.

38:56.134 --> 38:57.035
Why?

38:59.438 --> 39:03.409
She's a leaver, a ghost.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.076
She's never faced
real adversity,

39:05.176 --> 39:07.312
never had to deal
with terrible consequences.

39:07.413 --> 39:10.582
When something goes wrong
in space, as it always does,

39:10.682 --> 39:12.551
she's gonna crack.

39:12.651 --> 39:16.555
So, your judgment is what?

39:16.655 --> 39:18.356
She needs a trip
to the shaker room.

39:18.457 --> 39:19.725
Who among us doesn't?

39:19.825 --> 39:21.427
Reject her.

39:21.527 --> 39:23.629
If she comes crawling back,
reject her again.

39:23.729 --> 39:26.432
If six months later,
she makes another attempt,

39:26.532 --> 39:27.933
stress test her once more.

39:28.033 --> 39:30.769
I can't wait to run
my next candidate by you

39:30.869 --> 39:34.105
so we can do this
all over again.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.708
I'm not sure
I'm gonna be available.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.312
I've realized
I like working with people,

39:41.413 --> 39:43.081
not just judging them.

39:43.181 --> 39:46.585
That's not all it is.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.559
Look...

39:53.659 --> 39:57.663
we all have to chase
our truest calling.

39:59.765 --> 40:04.770
Mine is to make
this universe traversable

40:04.870 --> 40:07.238
and to leave this company
a living organism

40:07.338 --> 40:12.077
that can thrive long after
I've gone off on Manticore-IX.

40:13.645 --> 40:18.517
To do that, I need stewards.

40:18.617 --> 40:22.454
That's not what
you're looking for me to do.

40:22.554 --> 40:25.591
You're asking me to sort people
into one box or another,

40:25.691 --> 40:28.093
like a second-rate Freud,
which --

40:28.193 --> 40:29.394
which is Freud.

40:29.495 --> 40:33.665
Anyone with a DSM-V
and a label maker can do that.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.801
I don't want distance.

40:35.901 --> 40:38.236
I like getting messy.

40:39.671 --> 40:43.108
The power of the instant --
That's what excites me.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.343
Ice into steam -- or back.

40:46.678 --> 40:49.581
Is this a test? To see
if I come crawling back?

40:49.681 --> 40:52.083
No.

40:52.183 --> 40:54.620
I don't test people
that way.

41:07.365 --> 41:09.467
But...

41:09.568 --> 41:11.002
if you ever decide

41:11.102 --> 41:13.271
to grapple with why you feel
happiness for you

41:13.371 --> 41:15.974
can only exist
light-years away

41:16.074 --> 41:20.311
or in the company
of hairless 21-year-old girls,

41:20.411 --> 41:23.815
come see me.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.017
We can fix that quick.

41:33.091 --> 41:35.060
Holy shit.

41:35.160 --> 41:35.994
No.

41:36.094 --> 41:37.495
What's up?

41:37.596 --> 41:40.532
Dan Wolfe just got popped
for aggravated pimping.

41:40.632 --> 41:42.768
Mercy Squad nurses
were turning tricks.

41:42.868 --> 41:45.804
One of them solicited sex
from a PM at Vista Verde.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.180
Hey, babe.

41:55.280 --> 41:57.082
How'd you do it?

41:59.084 --> 42:01.519
I told you --
I'm a businesswoman.

42:01.620 --> 42:04.856
That you are.

42:04.956 --> 42:07.859
Love you. Bye.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.061
You should really put
a bocce court in.

42:10.161 --> 42:12.230
This floor is so level,
it's a waste not to.

42:12.330 --> 42:14.499
I'm kicking myself
I didn't think of that.

42:14.600 --> 42:15.967
Thanks for taking
the meeting.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.502
Anything for Bruno.

42:17.603 --> 42:21.006
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:21.106 --> 42:22.540
Thank you, Bruno.

42:22.641 --> 42:23.975
Sure.

42:25.577 --> 42:26.511
Do your best.

42:26.612 --> 42:28.113
-Yeah.
-Right.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.416
This is incredible.
What do you put in it?

42:31.516 --> 42:33.585
Dough, sauce, cheese.

42:33.685 --> 42:36.187
That's insane. What's, like,
your secret ingredient?

42:36.287 --> 42:37.956
Well, I start
with the dough

42:38.056 --> 42:40.759
and a little sauce
and then cheese.

42:40.859 --> 42:42.427
Huh. Awesome.

42:42.527 --> 42:44.329
Keep it up.

42:46.965 --> 42:48.566
He called you Marco
out there.

42:48.667 --> 42:50.268
I go by Marc
outside the family.

42:50.368 --> 42:51.970
-Uh-huh?
-Yeah.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.271
I shortened it.

42:53.371 --> 42:55.340
Yeah, no, I get that.

42:55.440 --> 42:57.108
Me, I'm proud
of where I come from.

42:57.208 --> 42:59.244
Oh, I'm intensely proud
of my people.

42:59.344 --> 43:01.112
-That's why I'm here.
-Mm-hmm.

43:02.848 --> 43:04.115
Are we waiting for someone?

43:04.215 --> 43:05.550
No.

43:05.651 --> 43:07.518
Sit.

43:09.354 --> 43:12.991
So... tell me.

43:13.091 --> 43:15.560
Aside from your pride,

43:15.661 --> 43:18.797
why would I ever put
any of my money

43:18.897 --> 43:20.565
in your corner
of the state?

43:20.666 --> 43:23.935
Sandicot's downtown
is ripe for redevelopment.

43:24.035 --> 43:25.336
Buildings
waiting to be razed

43:25.436 --> 43:27.405
and replaced
with LEED-certified condos

43:27.505 --> 43:29.307
and a city council
on which I sit...

43:29.407 --> 43:30.308
Mm-hmm.

43:30.408 --> 43:31.977
...which is
highly motivated to --

43:32.077 --> 43:34.612
Okay.
What you've just described --

43:34.713 --> 43:37.182
and no offense,
since I know it's your home --

43:37.282 --> 43:40.385
but what you've just described
is a shithole.

43:40.485 --> 43:42.587
The whole county's
on the edge of default.

43:42.688 --> 43:46.257
It's not called a distressed
debt because we're thriving.

43:46.357 --> 43:49.761
You get to buy it cheap --
pennies on the dollar.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.330
Yeah, more like millions
on hundreds of millions.

43:52.430 --> 43:54.265
Well, think of that upside.

43:54.365 --> 43:58.704
Look, I get offers like this
every day.

43:58.804 --> 44:00.872
The only reason
you got through this door --

44:00.972 --> 44:03.141
I know. And I don't expect
you to do this deal

44:03.241 --> 44:04.575
as a favor to my uncle.

44:04.676 --> 44:07.345
I expect you to do it
because of the casino.

44:07.445 --> 44:09.647
You buried the lede, kid.
Come on.

44:09.748 --> 44:11.683
Okay.
Tell me about the casino.

44:11.783 --> 44:14.485
It's gonna be paradise.

44:14.585 --> 44:16.554
Monte Carlo.

44:16.654 --> 44:18.857
You never been
to Monte Carlo, have you?

44:20.391 --> 44:23.361
It's the Sandicot
of the Riviera.

44:30.201 --> 44:31.336
Tell me.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.973
Okay, I don't care
if you spit or swallow.

44:35.073 --> 44:36.742
Just don't keep me waiting.

44:36.842 --> 44:38.509
The faucet's back on.

44:38.609 --> 44:39.845
It worked?

44:39.945 --> 44:41.012
Overnight.

44:41.980 --> 44:44.315
So, what do you want me
to do now?

44:44.415 --> 44:46.417
Am I going to have
to wear a wire?

44:46.517 --> 44:48.586
You're gonna be a hero.

44:48.686 --> 44:50.021
Talk soon.

44:53.859 --> 44:57.929
Spartan-Ives is back
to rigging Treasury auctions.

44:58.029 --> 44:59.430
We've got a beachhead.

44:59.530 --> 45:03.902
Sometimes you just got to trust
people to be who they are.

45:05.570 --> 45:08.039
Every time I think
maybe I'm caught up...

45:08.139 --> 45:11.009
Mm.
Long time in this racket.

45:11.109 --> 45:13.711
Still impressive.

45:13.812 --> 45:15.346
Thank you.

45:15.446 --> 45:17.415
Come on.
Let's hit the Gorilla truck.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.818
No, I'm not gonna watch
you eat a number five.

45:19.918 --> 45:22.087
Onions and -- Unh-unh.

45:22.187 --> 45:23.922
Stay here
and have some hand salad.

45:24.022 --> 45:25.623
Please.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.325
Do me this favor.

45:30.762 --> 45:33.531
Do you think they really have
the inside track with Albany

45:33.631 --> 45:35.733
-on a gaming license?
-I don't want to guess.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.735
I want you to know
so that I know.

45:37.836 --> 45:39.470
Okay.

45:39.570 --> 45:41.072
And if it checks out,

45:41.172 --> 45:43.674
you know, that's the kind
of giving I can get behind.

45:43.775 --> 45:45.944
I mean, this is how
all charities should work.

45:46.044 --> 45:48.479
You mean benefiting you
more than anybody else?

45:50.248 --> 45:53.151
As much as.
Not more.

45:57.455 --> 46:00.058
People noticing
you have a new favorite.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.559
They're not happy
about it.

46:01.659 --> 46:04.462
Anybody who makes me money
is my favorite.

46:05.663 --> 46:08.333
Uh, look, Axe,
I know I'm late.

46:08.433 --> 46:10.902
Take a seat. You missed
the Sandicot meeting.

46:11.002 --> 46:13.271
-I'm sorry.
-Went fine without you.

46:15.740 --> 46:17.008
Take a fucking seat.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.377
I can't.

46:21.512 --> 46:23.348
Why are wearing sweatpants?

46:25.050 --> 46:26.517
Could you...

46:26.617 --> 46:29.120
Steph, step out, please.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.263
I woke up in a hotel
this morning.

46:38.363 --> 46:40.331
You're living
in the fucking Pierre.

46:40.431 --> 46:43.701
This was
the Americana Suites,

46:43.801 --> 46:46.771
some shit dive
next to Port Authority,

46:46.872 --> 46:48.473
with my ass on fire.

46:48.573 --> 46:51.376
And...

46:51.476 --> 46:53.778
I saw I had a tattoo.

46:53.879 --> 46:56.447
On your ass?

46:56.547 --> 46:58.884
Yeah.

46:58.984 --> 47:02.353
You got an ass tattoo?

47:02.453 --> 47:07.392
All evidence
points to that being the case.

47:09.627 --> 47:11.629
I need to see it.

47:11.729 --> 47:12.563
You want to --

47:12.663 --> 47:13.965
No, don't want to.

47:14.065 --> 47:16.367
No. I need to.

47:25.743 --> 47:28.779
What the fuck is that?

47:28.880 --> 47:30.048
Is that Yosemite --

47:30.148 --> 47:32.884
I think so.

47:32.984 --> 47:34.920
I was a fan.

47:37.255 --> 47:39.557
I'm sending you somewhere.

47:41.159 --> 47:42.660
Please, not rehab.

47:42.760 --> 47:46.064
No, not rehab.

47:46.164 --> 47:49.167
Well, you know what Dr. Sarno
says about that kind of pain.

47:53.004 --> 47:54.505
Excuse me.

47:59.144 --> 48:00.511
Yes?

48:05.050 --> 48:06.751
I'll buzz you in.

48:08.586 --> 48:10.755
I am so sorry.
I need one second.

48:16.327 --> 48:18.463
Want to hear a funny story?

48:18.563 --> 48:19.830
Not really.

48:19.931 --> 48:21.332
I need help.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.970
Did he send you?

48:25.070 --> 48:26.871
Yeah.

48:26.972 --> 48:29.207
But it's not for him.
I really do need help.

48:29.307 --> 48:31.409
You've always needed help.

48:31.509 --> 48:33.211
What's different now?

48:48.893 --> 48:51.729
I don't even remember
how I got it.

48:56.467 --> 48:58.103
Okay.

48:59.670 --> 49:01.172
Mnh-mnh.
Not today.

49:01.272 --> 49:04.075
I'm no longer available
to you on standby.

49:04.175 --> 49:07.845
So you want me to call
and schedule an appointment?

49:07.945 --> 49:10.381
Yes.

49:10.481 --> 49:12.183
Like a fucking grown-up.

49:14.385 --> 49:16.187
I can do that.

49:24.895 --> 49:27.198
I knew you'd reach out.

49:27.298 --> 49:30.001
Cooperating
was always the smart move.

49:33.071 --> 49:35.873
You think I tipped you?
Prove it.

49:38.543 --> 49:42.080
You think I had
a moment of moral confusion,

49:42.180 --> 49:44.182
forgetting why I do
what I do and who for?

49:44.282 --> 49:46.317
Prove it.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.453
You think
Chuck screwed up?

49:48.553 --> 49:50.188
Earn your 150k...

49:50.288 --> 49:51.822
You're making a mistake.

49:51.922 --> 49:53.524
...and prove it.

49:53.624 --> 49:57.395
Chuck Rhoades has proven shit
no one should be able to.

49:57.495 --> 49:59.264
And if he were going after
this case,

49:59.364 --> 50:01.866
he would have the target
nailed, dead to rights.

50:01.966 --> 50:03.568
But Chuck is lucky

50:03.668 --> 50:06.804
because he's not
being chased by himself.

50:06.904 --> 50:08.306
He's being chased by you.

50:08.406 --> 50:12.710
Nearer, My God, to Thee.

50:12.810 --> 50:14.845
Back the fuck off.

50:14.945 --> 50:18.249
That was the last song
the band played on the Titanic,

50:18.349 --> 50:21.552
and it is a dreary tune.

50:21.652 --> 50:23.954
I offered you a lifeboat.

50:24.055 --> 50:27.092
You picked up a violin.

50:27.192 --> 50:29.026
Happy fiddling, Bryan.

50:41.606 --> 50:44.775
* What do you mean,
I don't believe in God? *

50:44.875 --> 50:48.413
* I talk to him every day *

50:48.513 --> 50:51.582
* What do you mean, I don't
support your system? *

50:51.682 --> 50:54.252
* I go to court when I have to *

50:55.520 --> 50:58.589
* What do you mean, I can't get
to work on time? *

50:58.689 --> 51:02.026
* I got nothing better to do *

51:02.127 --> 51:05.296
* And what do you mean,
I don't pay my bills? *

51:05.396 --> 51:07.832
* Why do you think I'm broke? *

51:07.932 --> 51:10.268
* Huh? *

51:10.368 --> 51:13.904
* If there's a new way *

51:14.004 --> 51:16.141
-* I'll be the first in line *
-Oh!

51:16.241 --> 51:17.708
You flinched.

51:17.808 --> 51:20.945
* But it better work this time *

51:31.289 --> 51:33.458
Mr. Axelrod, good day.

51:33.558 --> 51:39.130
I'm Ira Schirmer, attorney
for Charles Rhoades Jr.

51:40.665 --> 51:44.101
I'll be asking you
a few questions.

51:44.202 --> 51:46.771
Orrin Bach
for Robert Axelrod.

51:46.871 --> 51:47.905
Are you ready?

51:48.005 --> 51:49.640
Rock and roll.

51:49.740 --> 51:51.942
Let's go on the record.

51:54.044 --> 51:56.046
You assert that Mr. Rhoades
harassed you --

51:56.147 --> 51:57.815
I'm sorry.
Can we go off the record?

51:59.817 --> 52:04.121
I just wanted to say,
you did a great job rebuilding.

52:05.623 --> 52:07.592
Sometimes I laugh myself
to sleep at night

52:07.692 --> 52:09.960
just thinking about you
ripping the place apart.

52:10.060 --> 52:11.429
-Hey, Chuck.
-Oh.

52:11.529 --> 52:13.431
You know,
I never think about it.

52:13.531 --> 52:16.000
But then, of course,
I'm not alone at night.

52:16.100 --> 52:17.668
Let's go
back on the record.

52:20.638 --> 52:23.140
You assert
that Mr. Rhoades harassed you.

52:23.241 --> 52:24.275
Off the record.

52:25.943 --> 52:27.712
Where are
you sleeping now?

52:27.812 --> 52:29.247
Bobby.

52:29.347 --> 52:31.416
Suitable accommodations.

52:31.516 --> 52:33.318
Mm-hmm.
Who paid for it -- me or Daddy?

52:33.418 --> 52:35.520
We all know
Uncle Sam pays you shit.

52:35.620 --> 52:37.422
It was me.

52:37.522 --> 52:39.390
Found some loose change
in the cushions.

52:39.490 --> 52:41.292
Is this going to happen
or --

52:41.392 --> 52:42.627
Back on the record.

52:45.330 --> 52:47.232
You assert
that Mr. Rhoades harassed you.

52:47.332 --> 52:49.700
How do you know he didn't
have a legitimate reason

52:49.800 --> 52:50.801
to be in your office?

52:50.901 --> 52:52.603
Well, it was
the middle of the night.

52:52.703 --> 52:55.206
He didn't come with a SWAT team,
not even a subpoena.

52:55.306 --> 52:57.808
It was just him,
trying to intimidate me.

52:57.908 --> 52:59.310
But his wife works for you.

52:59.410 --> 53:01.145
He could have been
coming to see her.

53:01.246 --> 53:04.114
His wife
had quit working for me.

53:08.118 --> 53:11.556
So, are you saying you did or
didn't intercede with the police

53:11.656 --> 53:14.592
and bribe them regarding
your employee, Mick Danzig?

53:14.692 --> 53:15.993
-I --
-Objection.

53:16.093 --> 53:18.162
This is a deposition.
Objections are waived.

53:18.263 --> 53:19.564
Except to form.

53:19.664 --> 53:21.666
That was
a compound question.

53:21.766 --> 53:22.667
I can answer.

53:22.767 --> 53:24.669
A smart man
listens to his lawyer.

53:24.769 --> 53:27.405
I'll rephrase.

53:27.505 --> 53:31.242
Did you bribe the police
regarding Mick Danzig?

53:32.977 --> 53:37.014
Look, this whole thing
is about what he did.

53:37.114 --> 53:38.283
That question isn't.

53:38.383 --> 53:39.917
So you're declining
to answer?

53:40.017 --> 53:41.185
Yes.

53:41.286 --> 53:43.220
An element of your claim
is damages.

53:43.321 --> 53:45.756
Are you willing
to open up your books

53:45.856 --> 53:47.725
to show
the concrete monetary damages

53:47.825 --> 53:49.260
you've supposedly incurred?

53:49.360 --> 53:51.262
Yes, I have damages.

53:51.362 --> 53:54.532
No, I am not willing
to show my books at this time.

53:54.632 --> 53:58.336
Ah, so then you must not be
asserting actual damages?

53:58.436 --> 53:59.870
You're saying
that your damages

53:59.970 --> 54:02.640
can be presumed
from Mr. Rhoades' actions?

54:02.740 --> 54:04.275
Right.

54:04.375 --> 54:05.776
Right.

54:05.876 --> 54:10.615
Legally, we call these mental
or emotional damages.

54:10.715 --> 54:12.283
So...

54:12.383 --> 54:14.218
are you saying
Chuck hurt you mentally,

54:14.319 --> 54:16.521
or are you saying
he hurt you emotionally?

54:30.267 --> 54:32.169
I'd like to take a break.

54:32.269 --> 54:34.672
Oh, you don't want to announce
to the whole Street

54:34.772 --> 54:36.341
that Chuck
hurt your feelings?

54:36.441 --> 54:38.643
He got into your head,
threw you off your game?

54:38.743 --> 54:41.446
Turn the camera off.
We're taking a break.

54:53.324 --> 54:54.258
What?

54:54.359 --> 54:56.827
Sanford Bensinger
is on the phone.

55:02.933 --> 55:04.602
Sandy.

55:04.702 --> 55:07.538
We call it the Giving Oath
because you fucking swear it.

55:07.638 --> 55:09.206
Do you understand
what an oath is?

55:09.306 --> 55:11.308
I do.

55:11.409 --> 55:15.746
I do, and I've already begun
moving on what we discussed,

55:15.846 --> 55:18.616
and actually,
I was gonna reach out to you

55:18.716 --> 55:20.718
to talk
about structuring a trust.

55:20.818 --> 55:22.653
You mean a photo op?

55:22.753 --> 55:24.121
Maybe in costume.

55:24.221 --> 55:25.723
Me as John the Baptist,

55:25.823 --> 55:27.291
you as the Son of Man.

55:27.392 --> 55:29.727
Hey, look, Sandy,
I'm as --

55:29.827 --> 55:31.596
I'm as upset as you are

55:31.696 --> 55:33.831
that our meeting
got tipped off to --

55:33.931 --> 55:37.234
Do me the courtesy of not lying
again on this phone call.

55:37.334 --> 55:40.438
I do not appreciate
being used.

55:40.538 --> 55:43.574
I got to be where I am
by connecting the dots,

55:43.674 --> 55:47.077
scores
of randomly placed ones.

55:47.177 --> 55:51.516
The NFL
is turning you down.

55:51.616 --> 55:54.218
I asked for the favor
of telling you myself.

56:01.526 --> 56:03.160
They're, um...

56:05.696 --> 56:08.499
They're really gonna walk away
from the highest bid?

56:08.599 --> 56:12.603
Sports franchises are how we
knight people in this country.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.505
And you're not royalty.

56:14.605 --> 56:17.074
You're a robber baron.

56:43.901 --> 56:45.903
* suspenseful music *

57:12.897 --> 57:14.832
We're talking
about damages.

57:16.934 --> 57:22.106
I have actual,
concrete, monetary ones.

57:24.575 --> 57:27.311
You cost me
a professional football team.

57:29.680 --> 57:32.116
Can we go
back on the record?

57:32.216 --> 57:36.186
Actually, I think
we need a break now.

57:36.286 --> 57:38.088
No.
Let's continue.

57:38.188 --> 57:40.257
A wise man
always listens to his lawyer.

57:40.357 --> 57:43.093
I keep my own counsel.
Let's keep going.

57:43.193 --> 57:45.029
Fucking right, we will.

57:47.898 --> 57:50.400
Fire away.

57:52.302 --> 57:55.439
* If there's a new way *

57:55.540 --> 57:59.009
* I'll be the first in line *

57:59.109 --> 58:01.478
* But it better work this time *

58:07.685 --> 58:11.188
* What do you mean,
I hurt your feelings? *

58:11.288 --> 58:14.725
* I didn't know
you had any feelings *

58:14.825 --> 58:17.828
* What do you mean,
I ain't kind? *

58:17.928 --> 58:19.930
* I'm just not your kind *
