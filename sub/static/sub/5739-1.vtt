01:40.815 --> 01:44.895
Look at me.
Calm down. Calm down!

01:45.055 --> 01:48.495
What happened to
the others? Look at me.

01:48.575 --> 01:51.495
Fucking dead!
The whole fucking platoon!

01:51.575 --> 01:55.095
- The Sarge totally lost it,
went nuts. Killed everyone!
- What?

01:55.215 --> 01:57.495
Get off me!
Let me go!

01:57.615 --> 02:00.175
They're all dead!
All fucking gone!

02:00.295 --> 02:03.015
Ah, you son-of-a-bitch!

02:03.135 --> 02:06.135
Let's get the fuck
outta here!

02:06.255 --> 02:09.735
Come on, man, let's move.
Move! Come on, man. Come on!

03:58.936 --> 04:00.896
Sarge?

04:04.576 --> 04:07.016
What the hell
happened here?

04:16.736 --> 04:20.096
They wouldn't listen.

04:20.216 --> 04:22.536
The village was cleared.

04:22.656 --> 04:25.536
These people are innocent.

04:25.656 --> 04:28.376
They're all
fucking traitors.

04:28.496 --> 04:31.416
You turn around and they
stab ya in the back.

04:31.536 --> 04:33.496
Hey, Sarge?

04:35.017 --> 04:39.577
My tour's up. I just
want to go home.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.297
Come on. Let's go home.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.457
Let's go.

04:44.577 --> 04:47.777
Just like the others.
You just want to leave.

04:49.537 --> 04:51.537
Like none of this shit
ever happened?

04:53.657 --> 04:58.497
It happened! And it
doesn't just go away.

04:58.617 --> 05:01.617
You just can't walk away,
d'you hear me?

05:03.137 --> 05:05.097
Do you hear me?

05:12.017 --> 05:16.297
You're a traitor, too.
Aren't you, farm boy?

05:16.417 --> 05:18.657
No.

05:20.057 --> 05:22.777
Prove it.

05:22.857 --> 05:28.177
Kill her! Kill that
motherfuckin' traitor.

05:28.257 --> 05:30.777
That's an order!

05:37.497 --> 05:39.817
Get up. Come on!

05:39.937 --> 05:42.057
Come on!

05:44.737 --> 05:47.217
Come on.

05:52.377 --> 05:54.977
Run!

06:07.617 --> 06:09.817
No!

07:08.258 --> 07:11.218
You got four minutes!
Four minutes!

07:26.138 --> 07:29.258
- Okay, next.
- Four more.

07:29.378 --> 07:32.018
- I mean, I can't find his tags.
- Excuse me, sir.

07:32.138 --> 07:34.698
All right, here we go.
What the-

07:34.818 --> 07:38.738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

07:38.858 --> 07:41.498
Nice touch. I'd hate to be
the poor schmuck...

07:41.618 --> 07:45.618
who has to explain this shit
back home to Ma and Pa, huh?

07:45.738 --> 07:48.098
Sir, how do we write
this one up?

07:48.178 --> 07:50.098
I mean, what do we say
happened here?

07:50.178 --> 07:52.458
Nothin'. Nothin' happened
here at all.

07:52.578 --> 07:55.818
MIA. We didn't find anyone.
D'you understand me?

07:55.938 --> 07:59.218
What. They're gonna
call this MIA?

07:59.338 --> 08:04.178
Lincoln, this is Eagle.
Come in. I've got
a code zebra. Can you copy?

08:04.298 --> 08:07.258
Only a few hours ago.
At least ten bodies.

08:07.378 --> 08:11.498
- Yes, sir. Pack 'em in ice.
- We're movin' out.

08:11.618 --> 08:14.058
Great.

08:14.178 --> 08:16.098
Ice.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.619
Let's move it, move it, move it!
Let's go, go, go!

11:05.300 --> 11:07.700
All right.
How's the picture?

11:10.420 --> 11:14.740
- Pretty ugly.
- Very funny. Very funny.

11:14.900 --> 11:17.340
I need a ladder.

11:17.420 --> 11:20.620
Can you see me?
How's my hair?

11:20.740 --> 11:22.900
Let's go.

11:22.980 --> 11:26.980
- Somebody my size. Yeah.
- Systems check.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.020
Next.

11:30.860 --> 11:34.420
- How's the focus?
- Next.

11:34.500 --> 11:36.540
Good. Let's go.

11:36.620 --> 11:38.900
Okay, brother, go.

11:39.020 --> 11:40.900
All right, so
we got 'em all.

11:41.020 --> 11:43.620
We don't have much time.

12:14.460 --> 12:17.701
- Position seven, status.
- They're bringing
the next one out.

12:27.381 --> 12:31.901
Excuse me. Excuse me, please.
I'll have a statement for you
later on, okay? Thank you.

12:34.141 --> 12:36.621
Colonel, they just
killed another hostage.

12:36.701 --> 12:38.941
- Current status.
- We can't even take
one of them down.

12:39.061 --> 12:41.701
They're all linked
to an intercom system.

12:53.221 --> 12:55.141
They're in the water.

12:57.141 --> 12:59.621
Colonel. Where'd
you drop 'em off?

12:59.781 --> 13:03.861
- About a mile and a half away.
- Mile and a half?
We got 13 minutes.

13:07.821 --> 13:11.261
- Ah, yo!
- Hold on a minute. Hold on.

13:11.381 --> 13:13.821
Hi. I'm with the press, CNA.
Uh. They're waiting for me
right there.

13:13.901 --> 13:16.301
Right through there.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.541
- I'm cancelling the remote.
- Aw, Charles, will you relax?

13:19.661 --> 13:22.101
- We're supposed to go
live here in one minute.
- He's gonna kill me.

13:22.221 --> 13:24.901
- He's absolutely gonna kill me.
- Look out.

13:24.981 --> 13:27.021
- Hey, where you goin'?
- See? There she is.

13:31.221 --> 13:33.181
I know. I'm running
a little late.

13:33.261 --> 13:35.501
- A little?
- Well, you know that
traffic killed me.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.581
- Veronica, we're live in 20.
- Twenty?
- Where the hell were you?

13:37.701 --> 13:39.981
- I've been phoning
your hotel for hours.
- Your mark?

13:40.061 --> 13:41.781
- I got my mark.
- Come on, come on, come on.

13:41.861 --> 13:44.381
- We're on the satellite.
- Glasses.
- Glasses.

13:44.501 --> 13:47.101
- Mike.
- Mike. Okay.

13:47.221 --> 13:49.941
- Ten. Nine. Eight, seven-
- Nice shoes.

13:50.061 --> 13:52.341
- No feet.
- Hey, stop screwin' around.
Come on.

13:52.461 --> 13:55.181
- Three, and live.
- Cigarette!

13:55.301 --> 13:59.061
With nearly 30 hostages held
inside the power station at
the base of the structure.

13:59.141 --> 14:01.781
The gunmen claim that
they will not release
any of their prisoners...

14:01.941 --> 14:04.501
until various of their comrades
are released from federal
penitentiaries...

14:04.661 --> 14:07.181
- across the United States.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

14:07.341 --> 14:09.261
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

14:10.741 --> 14:12.662
Keep your eyes open.

14:16.302 --> 14:18.262
Shut up!

14:20.902 --> 14:24.342
I said shut up!

14:24.462 --> 14:26.942
Hey, do as you're told
and you won't get hurt.

14:27.062 --> 14:29.462
Quiet down.

14:29.542 --> 14:31.742
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

14:41.822 --> 14:44.502
- Colonel, they're at the tower.
- We need a unit.
- A mile and a half...

14:44.622 --> 14:47.662
under four minutes?

14:47.782 --> 14:49.702
They're eight seconds
behind schedule.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.422
This is Veronica Roberts
reporting live for CNA.

14:52.542 --> 14:55.622
- And we're out.
- See? What'd I tell ya?
No problem.

14:55.742 --> 14:58.462
No problem? This network
does not revolve around you.

14:58.582 --> 15:01.422
Well, what are you saying,
Charles, I'm not the center
of the universe? Is that it?

15:01.502 --> 15:04.462
- Don't crack wise with me.
- Come on, lighten up, Charles.

15:04.542 --> 15:07.462
I mean, okay, I don't play
the game by your rules, but
I always get you the story.

15:07.582 --> 15:11.182
You think just because
you broke a few stories
that you're indispensable.

15:11.342 --> 15:13.342
Well, I had a little chat
with the network today,

15:13.502 --> 15:15.982
- and you know what. Ronnie?
- No, what, Chuck?

15:17.302 --> 15:19.222
You're fired.

15:26.822 --> 15:29.262
They're entering
the drain-off tunnels.

15:34.542 --> 15:37.862
GR13, take aim
and hold fire.

15:37.942 --> 15:42.622
- Checkpoint one, all clear.
- Checkpoint two, all clear.

15:42.742 --> 15:46.582
GR44 is in position.
Take aim. Fire.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.662
Fire.

15:48.782 --> 15:51.182
Move in and secure
the objective.

15:52.262 --> 15:54.222
Clear that
image up.

15:54.302 --> 15:56.222
Clear it.

15:57.302 --> 15:59.262
Got it.

16:11.943 --> 16:14.263
Interceptors are
secured and powered.

16:14.383 --> 16:16.943
- Begin playback.
- Playback.

16:17.103 --> 16:21.023
- Rolling.
- Checkpoint one, all clear.

16:21.143 --> 16:23.143
Checkpoint two, all clear.

16:23.263 --> 16:25.783
Checkpoint three, all clear.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.583
They're buying it.

16:33.903 --> 16:35.863
Who the hell
are these guys?

16:55.943 --> 16:59.223
- Okay, okay, here we go.
Here we go.
- Terminate objectives.

16:59.343 --> 17:01.343
Checkpoint three, all clear.

17:05.943 --> 17:09.183
Activate interceptors now.

17:11.782 --> 17:13.943
I think homeboy's startin'
to like this shit.

17:14.063 --> 17:16.463
Don't be ridiculous.
Continue playback.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.183
Checkpoint three,
all clear.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.023
- Okay, we're inside.
- Begin phase two.

17:34.103 --> 17:35.903
Phase two initiated.

17:46.063 --> 17:48.543
- Look at this guy.
- How the hell did he-

17:48.663 --> 17:52.663
- Hold it there, buddy!
- Hey! Hold it, pal!

17:52.783 --> 17:55.103
Two gunmen, semiautomatic,

17:55.223 --> 17:58.303
fully loaded,
main target to rear,

17:58.463 --> 18:01.183
loaded pistol and
explosives detonator.

18:01.303 --> 18:03.304
Shoot him!

18:15.464 --> 18:19.024
You are cleared- I repeat:
You are cleared to proceed.

18:38.424 --> 18:41.944
GR13, all clear.

18:42.024 --> 18:45.664
No injuries. Gentlemen,
I think everybody's okay.

19:01.344 --> 19:05.424
- Arizona team.
- GR44, status report.

19:08.384 --> 19:12.184
- GR44, do you read me?
- Problem?

19:12.264 --> 19:15.264
- He's- He's not responding.
- Well, try another frequency.

19:15.384 --> 19:18.744
GR44, status report, now.

19:18.864 --> 19:21.544
Kill the motherfuckin'
traitor.

19:23.304 --> 19:25.304
That's an order!

19:28.944 --> 19:30.784
GR44, respond!

19:33.384 --> 19:36.144
Colonel Perry, how many
of the UniSols were
injured in the rescue?

19:36.304 --> 19:40.064
- Who are these guys, anyway?
- I will address your questions
accordingly.

19:40.184 --> 19:44.664
As you all know, this marks
the third successful mission
for the universal soldiers,

19:44.784 --> 19:49.104
again without any casualties
and without any injuries.

19:49.224 --> 19:51.064
As to the identity
of the UniSols,

19:51.184 --> 19:53.064
- that still remains classified.
- But, Colonel-

19:53.184 --> 19:57.705
These men have families,
and I will not do anything
to jeopardize their lives.

19:57.825 --> 20:00.185
- Now if you'll excuse me. I have
other matters to attend to.
- But, Colonel-

20:00.305 --> 20:03.105
- Thank you.
- Lieutenant. Could I
have a statement, please?

20:03.225 --> 20:06.145
There will be a complete
briefing this evening.

20:06.265 --> 20:08.785
We can't shoot these guys.
What the hell are we doin' here?
We need pictures.

20:08.945 --> 20:12.385
Lieutenant, please, just,
just one statement. Please.

20:12.505 --> 20:14.425
Lieutenant!

20:19.865 --> 20:23.745
Huey, I've got an idea.

20:23.865 --> 20:25.745
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

20:25.865 --> 20:27.345
I hate when you do this.

20:36.465 --> 20:40.145
Ronnie, what are ya doing?
This is too close!

20:40.305 --> 20:42.185
They're gonna see us.

20:49.545 --> 20:52.065
We shouldn't be here.

20:52.185 --> 20:54.945
All these guards. They must
still be in there, huh?

20:55.025 --> 20:56.985
Yeah.

20:58.665 --> 21:02.185
- You getting this?
- Those guys got one
hell of a mobile home.

21:14.225 --> 21:18.225
They're turning blue.
Lowering to final stage...

21:18.385 --> 21:20.905
at 60 sub-zero.

21:21.025 --> 21:23.865
He just froze up. We can't
figure out what happened.

21:23.985 --> 21:26.265
- What do you mean "froze up"?
- At the end of the mission,

21:26.385 --> 21:29.625
he became completely
unresponsive.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.985
- Did he overheat?
- Colonel, he hardly
broke a sweat.

21:33.065 --> 21:36.065
GR44.

21:36.145 --> 21:39.345
Why did you not respond?

21:41.705 --> 21:44.265
What happened?

21:44.345 --> 21:47.185
- Innocent.
- Innocent?

21:47.305 --> 21:49.785
What do you mean
by "innocent"?

21:49.945 --> 21:52.265
The village was cleared.

21:52.385 --> 21:54.826
The girl was innocent,
Sarge.

21:54.986 --> 21:57.866
Sarge? Wh-wh-who the hell's
he talkin' about?

21:57.986 --> 22:01.666
That could be
an old memory.

22:01.786 --> 22:04.466
I think we should take him out
of the program until we can run
some tests on him...

22:04.586 --> 22:06.906
and find out what's
going on in his head.

22:07.026 --> 22:09.946
- GR44 stays with the program.
- But, Colonel-

22:10.066 --> 22:14.266
He just got a little mixed up.
Just give him the serum.

22:21.946 --> 22:26.426
Okay. Guys, memory clearance.
Take your positions.

22:27.586 --> 22:30.266
Activate injection.

22:48.906 --> 22:52.066
They're moving something
else onto the Tarmac.

22:52.146 --> 22:54.626
- We're not gonna get
anything from out here.
- Ronnie, are you nuts?

22:54.746 --> 22:57.146
It's a classified
military operation.

22:57.226 --> 22:59.426
You're not gonna get within
ten yards of that truck.

22:59.546 --> 23:01.706
I'll be right back.

23:08.866 --> 23:12.946
- You were confused.
- I was confused.

23:13.066 --> 23:16.666
You must follow orders
at all times.

23:16.786 --> 23:19.306
I must follow my orders.

23:19.426 --> 23:22.266
- He's fine.
- Well. If you say so.

23:22.346 --> 23:24.466
You're in charge.

23:35.186 --> 23:39.106
Here we go.
Oh, this looks pretty bad.

23:41.826 --> 23:44.386
Looks pretty bad.

23:44.506 --> 23:47.626
As soon as the
flotation chamber is filled,
we'll have to put him in.

23:48.907 --> 23:51.027
Great.

23:55.027 --> 23:57.707
I always have to do this part.
I hate this part.

24:00.307 --> 24:05.187
Hey, Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!
Can I get a little help on this?

24:16.947 --> 24:20.107
Jesus. No casualties
or injuries, huh?

24:20.227 --> 24:23.667
Power up the cooling generators
on the flotation chamber.
He's almost ready.

24:23.787 --> 24:25.707
You got it.

24:27.187 --> 24:29.787
- He's ready. Yes, sir.
- Bring him in. Thank you.

24:31.947 --> 24:34.587
Prepare for flotation
chamber entry.

24:57.387 --> 25:00.107
Colonel, we've spotted
an intruder.

25:05.547 --> 25:09.827
Who the fuck is that?
She's takin' pictures.

25:09.947 --> 25:13.307
- Huey!
- Oh. Shit. What the hell
has she done this time?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.307
Start the car!

25:18.107 --> 25:20.467
I think now would be
a good time to leave, Huey.

25:20.587 --> 25:22.587
- What'd you get?
- Redemption.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.027
Let's get outta here.

25:26.867 --> 25:29.307
- Shit. Watch out!
- Look what you're doin'.

25:43.948 --> 25:45.868
D'you think we lost 'em?

25:55.548 --> 25:57.828
How ya doin'?

25:57.948 --> 26:02.268
Uh, Veronica Roberts,
uh, uh, CNA.

26:05.228 --> 26:07.828
You wanna help me out?

26:10.388 --> 26:13.348
Thank you. Thank you very-
Hey, hey, hey! Easy!

26:13.468 --> 26:16.748
- Take it easy, man.
- Ow! Oh!

26:18.308 --> 26:20.588
Let go of me!

26:20.708 --> 26:22.588
- Huey. Hu-
- Okay, okay.

26:25.628 --> 26:28.628
You all right?

26:28.748 --> 26:31.268
Okay, they got 'em.
Bingo.

26:31.388 --> 26:33.268
I want to speak
to someone in charge.

26:36.908 --> 26:40.628
- You guys speak English?
- Awaiting instructions.

26:40.708 --> 26:44.508
Tell them to find that film
and bring those civilians
back to base.

26:44.628 --> 26:49.468
I'm sure that we can handle this
whole situation, all right? Uh,
if I could make a phone call.

26:49.588 --> 26:51.588
- What's wrong with these guys?
- I don't know.
- GR13.

26:51.708 --> 26:53.588
Get the film
and return to base.

26:53.708 --> 26:58.588
- The film.
- Uh, fellas. Look,
I don't know where-

26:58.708 --> 27:01.268
- Hey, hey,
I don't know what you-
- Hey, she didn't do anything.

27:03.268 --> 27:06.228
Christ! GR13, cease fire!
Cease fire!

27:06.308 --> 27:09.748
Do you read me? Cease fire!
Cease fire! I repeat:

27:10.908 --> 27:13.268
- Fire. Fire.
- That's an order!

27:27.628 --> 27:29.908
GR86, visual.

27:30.028 --> 27:32.468
What the fuck is he doin'?

27:32.588 --> 27:36.108
Stop the girl.
Shoot if you have to.

27:41.269 --> 27:44.149
GR44. stop the car.

27:44.269 --> 27:48.069
That is an order.

27:48.149 --> 27:51.589
- Whaddya doin'? Whaddya doin'?
- He stopped the car.
- Cease fire! Cease fire!

27:51.709 --> 27:55.349
What the hell you doing?
Come on! Get out of here!

27:55.509 --> 27:58.349
Hey, go! Jesus Christ,
they're gonna kill us!

27:58.429 --> 28:03.189
- GR44, turn the car around.
- Are you deaf?

28:03.309 --> 28:06.029
You are simply confused.

28:06.149 --> 28:09.909
- I'm confused.
- What are you talking about,
man? Let's go. Hit it!

28:10.029 --> 28:14.589
- Do not listen to her.
- What the hell is that thing?

28:14.669 --> 28:19.469
- GR44, can you hear me?
- Will you stop fuckin'-
Stupid piece of shit!

28:19.549 --> 28:21.949
Shit! The bitch cut me off.

28:22.069 --> 28:25.789
- Go!
- I must follow orders.

28:25.909 --> 28:29.109
Bull shit.
Hit the road!

28:29.229 --> 28:31.549
Shit!

28:31.629 --> 28:33.629
Woodward, do something,
will ya?

28:37.309 --> 28:39.229
Traitor.

28:44.669 --> 28:46.909
He didn't do anything.

28:47.029 --> 28:49.109
Well. They're not gonna get away
with this shit. I swear to God,

28:49.229 --> 28:52.629
- they're not gonna
get away with this shit.
- You ready?

28:52.709 --> 28:54.829
- Just about.
- We have to take him
out of the loop.

28:54.909 --> 28:57.949
- He shot a man, for God's sake.
- Don't tell me what to do.

28:58.069 --> 29:01.749
Right now I need
every soldier I've got.
We're goin' after them.

29:03.229 --> 29:05.709
Colonel Perry.

29:05.869 --> 29:08.389
We killed an innocent man.

29:08.549 --> 29:10.829
What do you suggest
we do, Woodward?

29:10.949 --> 29:13.629
Let that reporter run off
with one of our UniSols?

29:13.749 --> 29:15.989
We can't just cover this up.

29:16.069 --> 29:19.349
We have a moral obligation
to tell the truth about this.

29:19.469 --> 29:23.149
I thought you were more
clever than that, Woodward.

29:23.269 --> 29:26.469
This whole goddamn program
is off the shelf.

29:26.549 --> 29:29.589
Do you really think
for one second those
wimps at the Pentagon...

29:29.709 --> 29:33.309
would allow the regeneration
of dead soldiers,

29:33.389 --> 29:35.950
American soldiers?

29:36.110 --> 29:38.430
I don't think I can be
a part of this anymore.

29:40.270 --> 29:43.710
If this is uncovered now,
we're all goin' to jail.

29:43.790 --> 29:46.190
Do I make myself clear?

29:51.110 --> 29:53.830
Why did you do that?

29:53.950 --> 29:55.870
Why did you help me out
like that?

29:55.950 --> 29:59.950
My tour's up.
Just want to go home.

30:00.070 --> 30:03.110
But I can't
until you're safe.

30:03.230 --> 30:05.510
Wh-what do you mean?

30:07.230 --> 30:10.670
My God! You've been shot!

30:10.750 --> 30:14.510
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, we
gotta stop the bleeding.

30:14.590 --> 30:15.790
Oh, God.

30:15.910 --> 30:18.150
Jesus Christ, it's gotta
hurt you, man.

30:28.990 --> 30:32.430
The bleeding has stopped.

30:34.950 --> 30:37.270
Get in here.
Secure your positions.

30:38.350 --> 30:40.910
All right,
secure and lock!

31:00.350 --> 31:03.830
What, wh-why are we stopping
now? What happened?

31:03.950 --> 31:06.150
Out of gas.

31:10.390 --> 31:13.590
We're out of gas.
Why not?

31:13.750 --> 31:15.670
Shit! God!

31:31.471 --> 31:35.591
- Oh, God.
- Tracking system activated
and we're in business.

31:35.671 --> 31:39.311
We've picked 'em up moving due
east seven miles ahead of us.

31:39.431 --> 31:41.311
Estimated time
of interception.

31:41.431 --> 31:43.711
- Four minutes.
- Four minutes and marking.

32:01.631 --> 32:04.631
How ya doin'?

32:04.751 --> 32:08.671
You must be pretty tired
after all that,
that pushing and stuff.

32:08.751 --> 32:12.271
Okay. Well,
I'm gonna go on the-
I'll be right back, all right?

32:14.511 --> 32:17.711
- Where you going?
- I'm gonna go make
a phone call.

32:17.791 --> 32:19.751
You mind?

32:22.071 --> 32:23.991
Okay? Okay.

32:32.031 --> 32:33.471
Okay.

32:35.431 --> 32:37.991
Change.

32:38.071 --> 32:40.831
Okay. All right.

32:50.631 --> 32:54.231
- I need some gas.
- Oh, ran out of gas yesterday.

32:54.351 --> 32:57.751
Uh, refuelin' truck will
be here in the morning.

32:59.471 --> 33:02.391
You wanna rent
a roo- room?

33:03.991 --> 33:05.991
Nice outfit.

33:06.111 --> 33:08.311
Shit.

33:08.431 --> 33:11.351
Hey, pal, you don't
look so good.

33:16.191 --> 33:19.431
- I need to cool down.
- Oh, well, all our rooms...

33:19.511 --> 33:21.431
all have air-conditioning,
you know?

33:21.511 --> 33:25.111
Got some with water beds.

33:25.231 --> 33:27.312
Hey. The, uh, pay phone's out.
Do you have a phone I can use?

33:27.432 --> 33:30.912
All our rooms all
have telephones, too,
only $50 a night.

33:31.072 --> 33:33.872
No, no, look, I don't need
a room, I need a phone.

33:33.992 --> 33:38.952
- What about this one?
- Oh, uh, sorry, that's, uh,
for employees only. Yeah.

33:56.952 --> 34:00.392
Oh, well. Since there's
the two of you, see, that's
called double occupancy.

34:00.552 --> 34:02.992
That's another ten dollars.
Yeah.

34:03.152 --> 34:05.712
Yeah, okay. Great.

34:05.832 --> 34:10.592
And a matter of a small
$20 security deposit.

34:10.672 --> 34:12.592
Of course. Twenty dollars.
Here you are.

34:12.672 --> 34:15.752
- Have a nice stay.
- Great.

34:28.472 --> 34:31.672
Great. Maybe there's already
something on the news.

34:57.352 --> 35:00.072
Commence UniSol
deployment.

35:00.152 --> 35:03.072
B and C teams, take
supporting positions.

35:05.912 --> 35:09.872
GR13, seek and destroy
local communication lines...

35:09.952 --> 35:12.512
in target area.

35:14.512 --> 35:19.312
And one prays for
the expedient. Concise handling
of the terrorist situation.

35:19.432 --> 35:23.713
In a related story.
Only hours after the rescue
at McKinley dam,

35:23.833 --> 35:26.233
news reporters become
news makers.

35:26.313 --> 35:29.353
Reporting live from
the scene, Chris Garfield.

35:29.473 --> 35:32.633
In a surprising development.
A CNA cameraman, Huey Taylor.

35:32.713 --> 35:36.513
Was shot and killed in
a motel room in neighboring
Eagle Rock City.

35:36.593 --> 35:40.113
Witnesses allege that Veronica
Roberts, a CNA correspondent,

35:40.233 --> 35:42.273
shot him after
an apparent argument.

35:42.393 --> 35:44.873
- No. I don't believe it.
- Cocaine and other narcotics
were found at the scene.

35:44.993 --> 35:47.993
No way.

35:48.073 --> 35:52.953
No way.
I don't believe this.

35:53.033 --> 35:55.673
They are not gonna get
away with this, man.
I mean, this is crazy.

35:55.793 --> 35:59.873
- You must return to your room.
- There isn't- I mean,
for cryin' out loud.

35:59.993 --> 36:01.953
Mother, come here.

36:02.073 --> 36:05.833
There has got to be a phone that
works in this godforsaken place.

36:05.913 --> 36:09.193
- This area is not secure.
- You know, why don't you-

36:10.753 --> 36:13.433
What are you doing?

36:13.553 --> 36:15.793
It's not safe for you
out here.

36:15.953 --> 36:17.993
Where're your clothes?

36:18.153 --> 36:20.753
I have to-

36:20.913 --> 36:23.913
I have to cool down.

36:31.513 --> 36:33.993
My God! You're burning up!

36:39.593 --> 36:43.473
I-I-I need i-ice.

36:44.513 --> 36:47.313
Okay, okay.

36:48.513 --> 36:50.513
Shame on ya.

36:53.993 --> 36:57.833
GR13, continue advance.

36:57.953 --> 36:59.953
Target in center
of structure.

37:06.073 --> 37:08.993
What the devil's she doin'
with all that ice?

37:09.073 --> 37:11.233
Maybe I should
call the police.

37:11.313 --> 37:15.713
I've heard of cold showers
before, but this is just
ridiculous.

37:15.833 --> 37:18.634
How ya doin'?

37:18.754 --> 37:22.234
I got all the ice
that I, I could. Uh,

37:22.354 --> 37:24.834
you okay?

37:26.834 --> 37:28.794
How's your-

37:31.914 --> 37:34.594
Your wound.

37:38.434 --> 37:41.234
It's, it's healing.

37:41.314 --> 37:45.994
I'm- I'm, uh, gonna make
that phone call and, uh,

37:46.114 --> 37:47.994
I'll, uh, call a doctor...

37:48.114 --> 37:51.874
or something.

37:51.954 --> 37:53.954
Heat and infrared check.

37:54.074 --> 37:57.754
Munitions and firearms
identifier powered and working.

37:57.914 --> 38:00.394
- Don't even start
with me, all right?
- Hey!

38:00.474 --> 38:03.274
- And take this lock off.
No, I'll take it off.
- Hey!

38:03.394 --> 38:06.874
Hey, lady, what are you
doin' to the phone?

38:06.994 --> 38:09.274
- You know how much
these things cost me?
- Sh-Shut up.

38:09.394 --> 38:12.034
- Forget- You got
a lot of nerve.
- Will you shut up?

38:12.114 --> 38:14.594
- This one doesn't work either.
- Huh?

38:14.714 --> 38:17.274
Women just don't know
how to use phones.

38:17.394 --> 38:19.314
You killed it!

38:21.354 --> 38:24.674
Hey, this is coming out
of your security deposit.

38:24.754 --> 38:29.314
Goddamn it.
He's got her in sight.

38:29.434 --> 38:33.394
GR13 has a lock on the girl.
What do you want me to do?

38:33.474 --> 38:36.154
- Tell him to wait
'til they're together.
- GR13, hold your fire...

38:36.274 --> 38:38.794
and maintain surveillance.

38:54.474 --> 38:58.514
Now, back to "Nixon and
the War Years, Part Seven."

38:58.634 --> 39:01.754
We will keep America the
strongest nation in the world,

39:01.914 --> 39:05.914
and we will couple that
strength with firm diplomacy.

39:06.034 --> 39:08.994
No apologies,
no regrets.

39:09.074 --> 39:11.034
Uh, there was no question
about that...

39:11.154 --> 39:14.355
because, as you know,
when I resigned,

39:14.435 --> 39:17.555
uh, later, President Ford
issued a pardon.

39:17.635 --> 39:22.595
When I accepted the pardon.
In that I made it very clear...

39:22.675 --> 39:25.075
that I regretted
what had happened.
And to what's, in effect,

39:25.195 --> 39:28.595
an apology for what had
happened. There are, however-

39:28.715 --> 39:30.675
I want that place
completely surrounded.

39:30.795 --> 39:35.955
GR86 and 61, take positions
at the rear of the motel.

39:36.115 --> 39:39.035
...on the war in
Vietnam, uh, who-

39:39.155 --> 39:41.635
How are you. Uh-
How you feeling?

39:41.795 --> 39:44.595
The war is over.

39:44.675 --> 39:45.995
Maybe not.

39:47.275 --> 39:50.795
All focus to visual. Powering
alternate scanning devices.

39:50.875 --> 39:54.195
Motion detectors
locked in.

39:54.275 --> 39:56.195
You know, something really weird
is going on around here.

39:56.275 --> 39:58.435
None of the phones in
this entire hotel work.

39:58.555 --> 40:01.275
I mean, there
hasn't been a storm.

40:24.515 --> 40:27.235
Okay, we got 'em
in the second room now.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.635
You better
duck and cover.

40:37.115 --> 40:40.635
- Follow me.
- Okay.

41:03.435 --> 41:06.675
The last wall is solid concrete.
He's not goin' anywhere.

41:09.876 --> 41:12.436
I think we got him trapped.

41:14.316 --> 41:16.436
Well, go ahead.
Knock it down.

41:17.556 --> 41:19.996
What?

41:20.116 --> 41:22.076
Get down.

41:27.396 --> 41:29.796
Soldiers, move in.

41:47.116 --> 41:50.556
Where in the hell is he?

41:50.636 --> 41:53.596
- I think we lost him.
- That's impossible.

41:53.676 --> 41:57.756
Garth, get back to your station
and get me some tracking,
for Christ's sake.

42:00.676 --> 42:03.036
- You have a car?
- Uh-huh.

42:03.116 --> 42:05.516
- Give me the keys.
- Hurry up. Tell him to hurry.

42:05.636 --> 42:08.316
- Hurry.
- Ya got 'em?

42:08.436 --> 42:11.116
- Thank you.
- Oh, good.

42:13.076 --> 42:14.916
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

42:15.036 --> 42:19.516
I am so, so sorry. Believe me,
I had nothing to do with this.
Really. I had no idea.

42:23.156 --> 42:25.436
- They're leavin' the motel.
- Damn it!

42:34.596 --> 42:37.036
- Hey!
- Oh, my God!

42:53.276 --> 42:55.876
Come on, Woodward.
I need you out here.

42:57.876 --> 42:59.876
Way to go, Garth.

43:04.317 --> 43:07.077
Twenty-dollar
security deposit, huh?

43:15.157 --> 43:16.997
Woodward.

43:28.757 --> 43:30.757
He's trying to cool himself.

43:36.437 --> 43:38.637
Are you sure they're
not following us?

43:38.757 --> 43:40.477
No.

43:40.597 --> 43:44.277
- You're such a comfort.
- Buckle up.

43:44.397 --> 43:47.677
- I'm fine.
- It's for your safety.

43:47.797 --> 43:49.677
How can you be
so damn calm?

43:49.797 --> 43:53.237
I mean. Your buddies back there
just shot enough ammo at us
to destroy eastern Europe,

43:53.317 --> 43:57.757
and you're sitting here bitching
at me about a goddamn seat belt?

43:57.877 --> 44:01.517
All right, all right, all right.
Here we go. All right?

44:01.637 --> 44:05.957
I'm all buckled up. All right,
look. Mr. Top Secret.

44:07.317 --> 44:09.597
I want some answers, okay?

44:09.717 --> 44:15.077
I mean, first of all, you know,
you, uh, you push a car faster
than my mother drives, okay?

44:15.197 --> 44:17.917
Uh, uh, you use ice like
other people use band-aids,

44:18.037 --> 44:20.797
and, and, and, and then you
just, you run through walls.

44:20.877 --> 44:24.397
Now. I'm sorry,
you know. But this is not
normal human behavior.

44:24.517 --> 44:27.917
Now just who the hell
are you?

44:27.997 --> 44:31.317
Where are you from, anyway? Are
you from France or Canada or-

44:31.397 --> 44:35.197
I mean, I figure you
gotta be French or something
because of your accent.

44:35.317 --> 44:38.437
What accent?

44:38.597 --> 44:41.757
All right, look, you. Um, you
got a family? You got friends?

44:41.837 --> 44:45.717
I mean, is there a Mrs. 44
waiting for you someplace? Uh-

44:45.837 --> 44:48.917
I mean, are you
avoiding my questions,
or. Or don't you know?

45:08.318 --> 45:11.278
What the hell
did they do to you?

45:11.398 --> 45:13.318
I don't know.

45:19.758 --> 45:22.998
But I'm going to find out.

45:49.078 --> 45:52.518
- Hey. Lady. No smokin'
around the pumps.
- I'm sorry.

45:52.638 --> 45:55.318
- Come on.
- Hey! Hey, come on! Would you
quit pulling on my arm?

45:55.438 --> 45:58.158
- It hurts.
- Park the car.

45:58.278 --> 46:00.758
- Park the-
- Let's go.

46:00.878 --> 46:03.678
- Park the car?
- I need some help.

46:03.798 --> 46:06.478
You need some help?
Oh, hey, come on. Man. I can't
help you with this thing.

46:06.558 --> 46:08.558
- Get in.
- Hey! Come on!

46:08.678 --> 46:11.158
What are you doing? Huh?

46:13.998 --> 46:16.518
Oh, come on, man,
not this again, huh?

46:16.678 --> 46:20.598
Is this necessary? Well,
could you at least leave
your pants on this time?

46:21.758 --> 46:24.158
Great. Just great.

46:24.238 --> 46:26.358
There must be
a tracking device on me.

46:26.438 --> 46:28.358
Well, what do you want
me to do about it?

46:28.438 --> 46:30.398
Look for something unusual.

46:32.318 --> 46:34.358
Something hard.

46:37.158 --> 46:39.438
Okay. All right.

46:44.198 --> 46:46.518
Stay in shape, don't ya?

46:46.598 --> 46:50.038
- What are you doing in there?
- Nothing!

46:50.158 --> 46:52.278
What do you mean
park your car?

46:52.398 --> 46:54.399
What, you never heard
of valet parking?

46:54.519 --> 46:56.999
Valet. Do I look
like a valet?

46:57.119 --> 46:59.399
What does this look like.
Beverly Hills?

46:59.519 --> 47:01.839
Is that supposed
to be there?

47:01.959 --> 47:06.519
Yes. Ye-yeah, it is. It's,
uh, it's very- very normal.

47:06.639 --> 47:08.559
Keep going.

47:09.879 --> 47:12.279
Right.

47:15.279 --> 47:17.919
Update informational
computer scanning system.

47:18.039 --> 47:21.319
They've stopped
up ahead in front of
a single-story structure.

47:21.439 --> 47:25.439
I think I found something. Right
here on the back of your leg.

47:32.599 --> 47:35.439
- Cut it out.
- Cut it out?

47:35.559 --> 47:39.159
Hey, wait a minute. I-l-I
can't- I can't cut it out.
I'm not gonna cut you.

47:42.199 --> 47:45.079
Oh! Oh, God!

47:49.519 --> 47:51.839
Oh, shit! Shit!

47:51.959 --> 47:56.119
You best hurry up
and get out of there.
I got a business to run here.

47:59.359 --> 48:01.679
- Take it.
- What?

48:01.799 --> 48:04.199
- Take it!
- Take it?

48:04.279 --> 48:07.239
We don't have
too much time.

48:07.319 --> 48:11.119
Oh, fu-
God, this is so gross!

48:14.959 --> 48:18.039
Oh, God,
this is so gross.

48:18.119 --> 48:20.759
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

48:22.519 --> 48:25.919
Good.
I gotta lie down.

48:47.599 --> 48:50.760
I want a complete scan
of the entire area.

48:53.520 --> 48:56.200
Enabling infrared.

48:56.320 --> 48:59.080
- That's his car.
- Scanning for body heat.

48:59.160 --> 49:01.600
- Got it.
- Arms.

49:01.760 --> 49:04.480
Pistol, fully loaded.
Desert Eagle. Semiautomatic.

49:04.600 --> 49:07.000
- That's him.
- Motions and heat scan.

49:07.120 --> 49:09.480
Follow tracking.
Flanking advance pattern.

49:09.600 --> 49:13.880
Three teams,
north, east, south.

49:14.000 --> 49:17.640
- Converge on my command.
- Team, advance.

49:17.760 --> 49:20.680
Surround target.
Teams east and south,

49:20.800 --> 49:23.840
prepare for break and ram.

49:32.680 --> 49:35.840
Prepare for break and ram.
Full charge.

49:35.960 --> 49:38.800
- Okay, guys, move in.
- Full charge.

49:45.000 --> 49:46.800
No, no! He tricked us!
H-hold on!

49:50.080 --> 49:53.080
Move out! Move out! All
UniSols, retreat immediately!

49:53.160 --> 49:56.960
Evacuate! Let's go!
Get out of there!

49:57.800 --> 50:00.600
Take cover!

50:04.800 --> 50:07.040
- Take cover!
- What the hell was that?

50:16.000 --> 50:20.480
Oh, my God.
They're on fire.

50:20.600 --> 50:24.760
Portable coolant.
Portable coolant, quick!

50:34.440 --> 50:36.280
Sarge!

50:36.360 --> 50:39.600
Get him out! Extinguishers!
Woodward, Garth!

50:39.720 --> 50:42.560
Garth! Get over here!
Get this guy. Get this guy.

50:42.720 --> 50:46.561
- Quick! Quick! Quick!
- GR74. Get GR14.

50:46.681 --> 50:48.641
Over here, Woodward!
Get him. Get him down.

50:50.561 --> 50:53.961
Damn you! Put him out,
I said! All right,
get those coolants ready!

50:54.041 --> 50:56.001
Get that truck operating!

50:58.001 --> 51:00.921
Woodward, get 'em over here!
Get more-

51:05.921 --> 51:08.441
Hurry up.

51:08.521 --> 51:10.961
- Yes. Sarge.
- God!

51:16.761 --> 51:18.681
Whoa.

51:20.641 --> 51:24.001
- Huh?
- Get over here!
Get over here! Get GR74!

51:24.081 --> 51:26.041
Get him out!
Put that coolant on him!

51:27.921 --> 51:32.721
- We need more extinguishers!
- Got it, got it. Let's go!

51:32.841 --> 51:36.041
- Come on! Hurry!
- Huh?

51:36.121 --> 51:38.761
Well, here I go again.
I'm outta here.

51:46.361 --> 51:49.841
- Come on. We're gonna
lose these two, Colonel.
- $250 million apiece,

51:49.961 --> 51:51.961
- we can't afford
to lose any of 'em.
- Buckle up.

51:52.121 --> 51:54.681
Seat belt, right.
Okay, go. Go!

52:29.881 --> 52:33.841
Oh, Jesus.
He should've buckled up.

52:33.921 --> 52:37.601
He's getting up. Go!
Go, go, go, go, go! Go!

52:51.362 --> 52:56.162
Shit! They're pullin' the plug.
Pack it up. We're headin' home.

52:56.322 --> 52:59.202
- Everybody, back into the truck.
Come on, everybody.
- Let's go! Let's move it!

52:59.322 --> 53:01.402
Woodward, what the hell
are you doin'?

53:01.562 --> 53:04.242
Yes, it's ice!
Get back in the truck!

53:04.362 --> 53:06.282
Pack it up!

53:11.042 --> 53:15.882
Get back into the truck, GR13.
The mission is cancelled.

53:20.082 --> 53:22.002
GR13.

53:23.322 --> 53:25.802
I said it's over.

53:25.922 --> 53:30.122
My name is Sergeant
Andrew Scott.

54:00.962 --> 54:04.482
He's just a mess. Lieutenant,
could you contact Colonel Perry?

54:04.602 --> 54:07.602
We'd like to have him
back in here. Thank you.

54:09.802 --> 54:11.882
You're wasting your time.

54:13.562 --> 54:17.162
- He can't hear you.
- Jesus!

54:17.242 --> 54:20.042
I've relieved Colonel Perry
of his command.

54:20.122 --> 54:23.202
GR13, this mission
has been cancelled.

54:23.282 --> 54:26.762
I order you back
to the cooling chamber, now!

54:26.882 --> 54:28.802
Orders?

54:30.882 --> 54:33.282
I'm giving the orders
from now on.

54:34.602 --> 54:38.163
We have a mission
to complete.

54:52.923 --> 54:54.883
Any questions?

54:57.683 --> 54:59.123
Uh-oh.

55:01.963 --> 55:04.843
- Somethin' to drink?
- Uh. Yeah. I'll just
have coffee.

55:04.923 --> 55:06.883
Okay. You?

55:12.123 --> 55:14.603
Brenda?

55:14.763 --> 55:17.683
Yes, Joe?

55:17.803 --> 55:21.643
Hey, uh, you want
something to drink?

55:21.763 --> 55:26.283
- Yeah? Okay.
He'll have a soda pop.
- Great.

55:26.403 --> 55:29.003
- He's not gonna make it.
- Will you just shut up?
He'll hear you!

55:29.083 --> 55:32.083
- Dr. Haines-
- Look, if he thinks
that we failed,

55:32.203 --> 55:34.123
he's gonna kill us both.

55:34.203 --> 55:37.483
You just keep working. If he
asks anything, just stall him.

55:41.683 --> 55:44.323
What's he doing?

55:47.003 --> 55:51.723
Overloading on muscle enhancers.
He's making himself stronger.

55:51.803 --> 55:54.843
Oh, great.
That's just what we need.

55:58.603 --> 56:01.683
You know, I feel like I'm
back in high school again.

56:01.803 --> 56:05.203
I can't make heads or tails
out of any of this stuff.

56:05.323 --> 56:08.083
But apparently, whatever
they've done to you,

56:08.203 --> 56:11.843
it's been done
on a genetic level.

56:11.963 --> 56:17.443
"The Surgeon General has warned
that cigarettes could be
hazardous to your health."

56:17.563 --> 56:20.403
Yeah, well, don't believe
everything you read.

56:23.203 --> 56:27.123
- Hey. Hey, hey!
That is my last pack.
- Are you ready to order?

56:27.243 --> 56:29.643
Uh, uh. Uh, yeah.
Just, uh-

56:29.723 --> 56:32.644
Just bring us
two of your specials.

56:32.764 --> 56:36.124
N-Now look,
they constantly refer to
a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

56:36.244 --> 56:38.404
Now, do you recognize
that name?

56:38.524 --> 56:40.724
No?

56:40.844 --> 56:43.084
Nothing. Hmm.

56:43.204 --> 56:45.804
I think I saw a number
in here somewhere.

56:45.924 --> 56:48.604
Do you think
you can help me?

56:48.724 --> 56:51.324
Well, it's, uh,
definitely worth a shot.

56:58.404 --> 57:01.844
- What?
- Why are you doing
all this for me?

57:04.124 --> 57:06.844
I'm not. All right?

57:06.964 --> 57:10.564
I'm not doing all this for you.
I'm doing it for me.

57:10.684 --> 57:12.684
I mean, you may not
realize this yet, but...

57:12.804 --> 57:15.164
you are one hell of a story.

57:17.444 --> 57:19.924
I wouldn't worry, though.
Uh, when the truth comes out,

57:20.004 --> 57:22.804
they'll, they'll probably
make you a hero.

57:22.964 --> 57:28.404
Ah. Here we go. "CG."
Christopher Gregor.

57:31.084 --> 57:34.124
All right, look, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna go check this out.
You, uh, you stay here...

57:34.244 --> 57:36.804
and wait for
the specials, okay?

57:36.924 --> 57:40.204
All right? Oh, uh,
do you have a phone?

57:40.284 --> 57:42.684
Out there.

57:42.804 --> 57:44.724
- Thanks.
- Here's the special.

58:32.205 --> 58:34.645
Sergeant Scott.

58:34.765 --> 58:36.925
Could I have
a word with you?

58:37.005 --> 58:39.085
I'm all ears.

58:41.445 --> 58:45.245
Your thermal monitor.
It's registering hot.

58:54.765 --> 58:57.765
Uh-oh. Nap time.

59:06.805 --> 59:09.285
Are you nuts?

59:09.405 --> 59:11.885
Why'd you tell him that?

59:12.005 --> 59:13.925
Quadruple his serum.

59:16.885 --> 59:19.325
What?

59:19.445 --> 59:21.405
I'm going inside.

59:24.085 --> 59:28.165
When he sits down,
I'll give you a signal.

59:28.285 --> 59:30.245
You increase the pressure,

59:30.325 --> 59:33.845
and I'll engage the injection
device on the arm of his chair.

59:41.525 --> 59:43.765
No, no, no.

59:43.845 --> 59:46.725
It'll look better if I go.

01:00:27.126 --> 01:00:29.086
Is there a problem. Medic?

01:00:29.166 --> 01:00:32.646
No, I'm just checking
the, uh, injection device.

01:00:32.766 --> 01:00:35.406
- Was it broken?
- It's making some
strange noises.

01:00:35.526 --> 01:00:37.326
I just wanted to make
an adjustment.

01:00:37.446 --> 01:00:40.726
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

01:00:43.086 --> 01:00:45.006
Let's see if it still works.

01:00:46.846 --> 01:00:49.646
Dr. Haines!

01:00:49.766 --> 01:00:52.366
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Are you ready?

01:00:52.486 --> 01:00:55.646
- It's memory clearance time.
- Stop it! Get up! No!

01:00:55.766 --> 01:00:58.326
- Stop it! You're gonna kill him!
- Dr. Haines! Dr. Haines!

01:00:58.406 --> 01:01:01.206
- Let him go!
- No!

01:01:02.566 --> 01:01:07.166
- Don't. Stop it!
- Get off me! Get off me!

01:01:07.286 --> 01:01:09.246
Get off of me!

01:01:23.046 --> 01:01:25.926
Shit. A fax.

01:01:47.886 --> 01:01:50.926
Hey. You got enough money
to pay for all this?

01:01:52.646 --> 01:01:54.926
You know, money? Cash?

01:01:55.006 --> 01:01:57.406
Dollars? Dinero?

01:02:03.046 --> 01:02:05.006
Hank!

01:02:05.126 --> 01:02:08.686
- Yeah.
- We got ourselves
a deadbeat back here.

01:02:08.806 --> 01:02:13.046
- What?
- He can't pay.

01:02:13.126 --> 01:02:15.406
Move it, Brenda.

01:02:15.526 --> 01:02:19.367
Hey, punk, I been slavin'
all day makin' that slop.

01:02:21.527 --> 01:02:24.487
- The food is good.
- Fuckin' A it is.

01:02:24.567 --> 01:02:28.807
The question is. How are
you going to pay for it?

01:02:31.807 --> 01:02:33.207
I don't know.

01:02:33.287 --> 01:02:35.767
You don't know.
Ain't that cute.

01:02:35.847 --> 01:02:38.407
I'm gonna bust
your head, punk.

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:41.687
I don't want to hurt you.

01:02:41.807 --> 01:02:44.687
Me? You don't want
to hurt Hank?

01:03:11.967 --> 01:03:14.167
I just want to eat.

01:03:14.287 --> 01:03:16.687
- Operator.
- Uh, yeah. Operator,
uh, a local number:

01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:20.127
Prefix KL5,
a Dr. Christopher Gregor.

01:03:26.567 --> 01:03:28.527
Hey, look, you ugly
son-of-a-bitch!

01:03:43.847 --> 01:03:48.647
Hey! You better put that down,
you son-of-a-bitch, because now
I'm gonna make you bleed!

01:03:48.727 --> 01:03:50.247
- May I help you?
- Uh, Veteran's Hospital?

01:03:50.367 --> 01:03:52.847
- Yes.
- Great. Operator, can you
tell me exactly where that is?

01:03:52.967 --> 01:03:55.847
- 1087 Clinton Avenue.
- Clinton. Wonderful.

01:03:55.927 --> 01:03:57.887
Thank you very much.

01:04:04.167 --> 01:04:06.167
Oh, shit.

01:04:23.168 --> 01:04:25.888
How was lunch, huh?

01:05:06.128 --> 01:05:08.168
I'm lookin' for a deserter.

01:05:08.328 --> 01:05:11.288
He's traveling
with a female POW.

01:05:11.368 --> 01:05:15.488
- Beat it, asshole.
- Hey. Soldier boy.
I'll be your POW.

01:05:15.608 --> 01:05:18.688
Nice necklace. I got one
just like it made out of noses.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.928
Now, they're in this
white and yellow Buick...

01:05:28.048 --> 01:05:31.568
with no front or rear window.

01:05:31.688 --> 01:05:34.328
Does that refresh your memory?

01:05:46.888 --> 01:05:49.048
GR74.

01:05:49.168 --> 01:05:52.608
Sergeant Scott
has issued an order.

01:05:52.728 --> 01:05:54.808
Will you obey that order?

01:05:54.928 --> 01:05:58.128
Yes, sir.

01:05:58.248 --> 01:06:02.448
He would like for you
to hold this for 30 seconds...

01:06:02.568 --> 01:06:04.488
and then drop it.

01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:15.249
One, two, three-

01:06:15.369 --> 01:06:18.769
- I know which way they went.
You got a pencil?
- Yeah? Sure.

01:06:18.849 --> 01:06:21.369
By the way, I like your belt.
Can I have it?

01:06:23.049 --> 01:06:25.529
25, 26-

01:06:42.449 --> 01:06:45.209
Hey! Where's the freezer?

01:07:20.129 --> 01:07:23.569
- Can I help you?
- Uh, yes, we would like
to speak with Dr. Gregor?

01:07:23.649 --> 01:07:26.609
Do you have an appointment?

01:07:26.729 --> 01:07:28.729
Yes. Yes, we do.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:34.409
- Follow me.
- Thank you.

01:07:37.449 --> 01:07:39.649
- Wait in there.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:07:46.929 --> 01:07:48.889
Oh. God.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:55.169
Oh, man, I'd kill for
a cigarette right now.

01:07:55.329 --> 01:07:58.089
You would kill someone
for a cigarette?

01:07:58.169 --> 01:08:02.129
No, no. It's an expression.
You know, a figure of speech.

01:08:02.249 --> 01:08:06.690
I mean, I wouldn't actually
kill someone for a cigarette.

01:08:06.810 --> 01:08:10.250
I might hurt 'em bad
at this point, but I
don't think I'd kill 'em.

01:08:14.130 --> 01:08:16.649
Dr. Gregor,
excuse me.

01:08:16.770 --> 01:08:19.970
- Yes? What is it?
- There's a young couple
here to see you.

01:08:20.090 --> 01:08:24.050
- They say they have
an appointment.
- Appointment?

01:08:33.930 --> 01:08:37.010
- No!
- Clear!

01:08:38.410 --> 01:08:40.649
Clear.

01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:47.250
It's all right, Luc.

01:08:47.330 --> 01:08:50.010
It's all right.
It's over.

01:09:02.770 --> 01:09:05.170
I-I saw it.

01:09:05.290 --> 01:09:08.130
I remember h- home.

01:09:08.210 --> 01:09:11.010
Is he all right? Let's
get him into the bathroom.

01:09:11.130 --> 01:09:12.370
We have to cover him
with ice.

01:09:13.410 --> 01:09:16.930
I said stand at attention,
private! Stand up!

01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:30.810
Goddamn it! The whole fuckin'
platoon's droppin' like flies!

01:09:34.330 --> 01:09:36.850
What the hell
are you staring at?

01:09:36.970 --> 01:09:41.649
Do you have any idea what
it's like out there? Do you?

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:46.649
Well, I'm fighting this
thing, man. It's like
kick ass or kiss ass.

01:09:46.770 --> 01:09:49.890
And I'm bustin' heads.

01:09:50.010 --> 01:09:52.330
It's the only way
to win this fucking war.

01:09:55.850 --> 01:09:57.770
And these shitheads,

01:09:59.891 --> 01:10:03.931
these yellow, traitoring
motherfuckers,

01:10:06.251 --> 01:10:08.731
they're everywhere.

01:10:14.651 --> 01:10:15.971
And I,

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:21.851
Sergeant Andrew Scott
of the U.S. Army,

01:10:24.811 --> 01:10:29.371
I'm gonna teach 'em all.

01:10:29.491 --> 01:10:31.531
- Hey. Freeze!
- Get down!

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:37.611
Drop your weapon!

01:10:40.251 --> 01:10:42.171
See?

01:10:44.411 --> 01:10:47.891
They're everywhere.

01:10:48.011 --> 01:10:51.651
How could you, a doctor,
be a party to this?

01:10:53.211 --> 01:10:56.331
I've been asking myself
that question for years.

01:10:56.451 --> 01:11:00.251
- Tell me how it worked.
- By hyper-accelerating
the bodies,

01:11:00.371 --> 01:11:05.251
we discovered that we could turn
dead flesh into living tissue.

01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:07.251
But to make the process work,

01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:10.091
the bodies ran at
dangerously high temperatures,

01:11:10.211 --> 01:11:12.291
needed to be constantly cooled,

01:11:12.411 --> 01:11:15.811
the brain sedated.
Controlled.

01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:19.531
Otherwise, it would
eventually stroke.

01:11:19.651 --> 01:11:22.571
- What are you saying, Doctor?
- Dr. Gregor.

01:11:22.651 --> 01:11:25.251
Excuse me.
Yes? What is it?

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:30.411
Thanks.

01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:37.491
Officials believe
Colonel Perry was shot and
killed early this morning.

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:41.011
Authorities are still looking
for reporter Veronica Roberts.

01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:43.731
Believed to be linked
to the two deaths.

01:11:43.851 --> 01:11:47.771
- They've set you up.
- Closer to home. A robbery
at Hayes Supermarket...

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:49.891
turned deadly when
three armed men...

01:11:50.051 --> 01:11:52.331
entered the supermarket
earlier today.

01:11:52.411 --> 01:11:57.012
- The leader of the gang
was videotaped-
- Regressive traumatic recall.

01:11:57.132 --> 01:12:01.492
- What?
- Trauma inflicted
at the time of death.

01:12:01.612 --> 01:12:04.052
See, in Luc's case.
He wanted to go home.

01:12:04.172 --> 01:12:08.172
When he awoke as a UniSol, he
returned to that single emotion.

01:12:08.292 --> 01:12:13.252
As for Scott. He thinks
he's still in Vietnam
fighting the insurgents.

01:12:13.372 --> 01:12:15.612
He doesn't realize
he's alive.

01:12:15.732 --> 01:12:17.852
He's not.

01:12:17.932 --> 01:12:22.012
He's dead. Just like me.

01:12:22.172 --> 01:12:26.172
- Be sure to write.
- Now boarding,
Los Angeles Express.

01:12:26.332 --> 01:12:28.332
Now boarding.

01:12:28.492 --> 01:12:30.772
This is insane.

01:12:30.892 --> 01:12:33.732
You heard what the doctor said.
You need medical help.

01:12:33.852 --> 01:12:35.772
I think that you should just
turn yourself in...

01:12:35.852 --> 01:12:38.012
and, and get started
on your treatments again.

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:40.972
- And then?
- Well, then we expose
everything.

01:12:41.092 --> 01:12:43.572
I mean, Dr. Gregor
will help us.

01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:46.412
I just want to go home.

01:12:46.532 --> 01:12:50.172
You don't seem to understand.
There's a chance
you won't make it.

01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:52.932
- I'm already dead.
- No, you're not.

01:12:53.092 --> 01:12:55.732
Goddamn it, you are
not dead, all right?

01:12:55.852 --> 01:13:00.732
You're alive. And that is
precious. You don't just
throw that away.

01:13:00.812 --> 01:13:03.732
Now boarding,
Los Angeles direct line.

01:13:11.092 --> 01:13:13.252
A bus ticket? Wh-

01:13:13.372 --> 01:13:15.532
To Los Angeles.

01:13:19.812 --> 01:13:23.852
Well- Wh-wh-what
is this for?

01:13:23.932 --> 01:13:25.892
You're safe now.

01:13:27.332 --> 01:13:29.532
He's only coming after me.

01:13:29.692 --> 01:13:32.772
You know, you're, you're
making a big mistake here.

01:13:32.932 --> 01:13:36.012
You've got your story.
That's what you wanted.

01:13:36.132 --> 01:13:38.932
You think-

01:13:39.012 --> 01:13:43.612
Last call, Los Angeles
Express. Now boarding.

01:13:43.692 --> 01:13:45.972
Last call.

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:50.173
Passengers bound for
Los Angeles, now boarding.

01:13:50.293 --> 01:13:52.693
Last call.

01:14:49.293 --> 01:14:52.333
You should have left me
while you had a chance.

01:14:55.093 --> 01:14:57.853
What,
and miss all the fun?

01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:29.053
Shit!

01:15:31.493 --> 01:15:35.453
We're gonna take 'em over
to County right now. Should
get there just after lunch.

01:15:43.493 --> 01:15:45.814
Oh, shit!

01:15:53.014 --> 01:15:55.534
Get rid of 'em.

01:15:57.934 --> 01:16:00.014
Oh, shit.

01:16:08.654 --> 01:16:12.694
- Got you now. Boy.
- Jesus Christ, he-
He's comin' right for us!

01:16:21.254 --> 01:16:23.374
Hey! Driver!

01:16:23.454 --> 01:16:25.974
Get us outta here!
Help!

01:16:38.894 --> 01:16:40.894
Holy shit!

01:16:48.614 --> 01:16:52.574
Excuse me. You should check
on your driver, pal.

01:16:52.694 --> 01:16:54.854
He don't look too hot.

01:17:02.334 --> 01:17:05.254
- What do we do now?
- We have to stop the bus.

01:17:05.374 --> 01:17:08.294
Oh. Gee, that's a great idea.
What a concept.

01:17:14.734 --> 01:17:17.734
What are you doing now?

01:17:17.814 --> 01:17:19.894
What the hell!

01:17:50.735 --> 01:17:52.775
Is it working?

01:18:06.815 --> 01:18:09.415
- Oh, God.
- Do you want to play catch?

01:18:09.495 --> 01:18:11.775
What do I do?
What do I do?

01:18:20.855 --> 01:18:22.735
Oh, shit!

01:18:22.855 --> 01:18:26.215
Can't find it. Here.
Oh, God.

01:18:31.535 --> 01:18:33.775
Are we having fun yet?

01:18:53.735 --> 01:18:55.735
Oh, my God!

01:18:58.575 --> 01:19:00.855
- You jump.
- W-W-Wait a minute.

01:19:00.975 --> 01:19:04.015
Wh-What happened to that whole
idea about stopping the bus?
I mean, I liked that idea.

01:19:04.175 --> 01:19:08.175
- You jump!
- I'm not goin' anywhere
without you.

01:19:18.455 --> 01:19:22.455
- We'll jump together.
- Okay. Together.

01:19:24.815 --> 01:19:27.495
Okay. Okay.

01:19:27.575 --> 01:19:29.935
Oh, shit.

01:19:53.456 --> 01:19:57.256
Hit him!
Hit him hard!

01:20:15.816 --> 01:20:19.296
Get the fuck up. Soldier!
Get the fuck up!

01:20:25.136 --> 01:20:27.456
Fuck!

01:21:08.976 --> 01:21:11.936
Freeze!

01:21:12.056 --> 01:21:14.536
Now, hold it right there!

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:23.616
Turn around. Get down
on your knees right now.

01:21:23.736 --> 01:21:26.416
Put your hands
over your head.

01:21:26.536 --> 01:21:29.856
Put your hands
over your head!

01:21:36.417 --> 01:21:39.537
I had three brothers.
Come on. Let's go.

01:21:41.937 --> 01:21:44.297
Keys. Come on! Get up!

01:21:44.377 --> 01:21:47.137
Money. Here. Here we go.

01:21:47.217 --> 01:21:51.697
Thank you. Come on, here we go.
Let's go, let's go.

01:21:51.817 --> 01:21:54.937
Get in the car.
I'll drive, I'll drive.

01:21:57.017 --> 01:21:59.057
Come on. Get in the car.
Hurry up!

01:22:02.257 --> 01:22:04.817
I'm gonna take you home.

01:22:06.937 --> 01:22:08.897
Buckle up.

01:22:59.537 --> 01:23:01.977
John, there's somebody
in the driveway. I think.

01:23:09.177 --> 01:23:10.617
Mrs. Devreux?

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:21.897
John, come here!
Oh, Luc, mon fils! Luc!

01:23:35.858 --> 01:23:38.578
Uh, wait a minute. What do
you mean Charles isn't there?

01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:41.418
Well, where the hell is he?

01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:44.898
No, look, I-I don't care
what you've heard, all right?
It's not true.

01:23:46.658 --> 01:23:48.618
No, look-

01:23:50.818 --> 01:23:52.698
- All right.
- Okay. Uh, yeah, yeah.

01:23:52.818 --> 01:23:56.378
- He's alive.
- I'll meet them there.

01:23:56.498 --> 01:23:57.898
All right.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.978
Um, I'm gonna
have to get going.

01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:09.538
A news van from
the network is gonna meet me
at the Sheriff's station.

01:24:09.658 --> 01:24:13.978
They still don't believe me,
but, uh, I think we'll be able
to change their minds.

01:24:15.218 --> 01:24:17.178
You okay?

01:24:17.298 --> 01:24:20.218
So many things are missing.

01:24:20.298 --> 01:24:22.938
So many things I remember.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:26.818
So many things I, I can't.

01:24:26.938 --> 01:24:30.698
Luc, it has been 25 years.

01:24:33.138 --> 01:24:35.338
Such a long time, 25 years.

01:24:37.458 --> 01:24:41.178
I'll never get
those years back.

01:24:41.258 --> 01:24:43.218
Look at it this way:

01:24:45.618 --> 01:24:47.818
You look great
for a 50-year-old.

01:24:54.018 --> 01:24:56.138
Care for a cup,
Miss Roberts?

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.098
Oh, um.

01:24:58.218 --> 01:25:02.578
No, no, I, uh,
I better get going, ya know.
They'll be waiting for me.

01:25:07.378 --> 01:25:10.938
- Be careful. It's
turning into a downpour.
- Okay.

01:25:11.098 --> 01:25:13.178
- Thank you. Thank you both.
- You're welcome.

01:25:18.818 --> 01:25:21.899
You gonna be all right?

01:25:22.019 --> 01:25:23.659
In time.

01:25:25.459 --> 01:25:30.379
You know something?
I haven't smoked a cigarette
in almost two days.

01:25:31.819 --> 01:25:34.299
Maybe I'll quit.

01:25:37.339 --> 01:25:39.299
I'll see ya.

01:25:57.779 --> 01:26:00.139
Shit.

01:26:00.259 --> 01:26:02.179
Where's the key?

01:26:03.499 --> 01:26:07.379
Oh, come on. Shit!

01:26:12.339 --> 01:26:14.699
Lookin' for somethin'?

01:26:26.139 --> 01:26:28.059
Ma?

01:26:40.979 --> 01:26:42.979
Mom? Are you there?

01:26:54.819 --> 01:26:56.619
Devreux!

01:26:56.739 --> 01:27:00.219
Devreux, can you hear me?
Nice farm.

01:27:00.339 --> 01:27:03.259
Exactly like you
described it back in 'Nam.

01:27:03.339 --> 01:27:06.859
Why don't you come out here and
join a little family reunion?

01:27:08.859 --> 01:27:12.979
I mean, what the hell
are you waitin' for.
Farm boy? Are you deaf?

01:27:18.340 --> 01:27:20.740
Get your ass out here!

01:27:20.900 --> 01:27:23.820
We have some
unfinished business. You and me.

01:27:29.220 --> 01:27:32.940
Wow! She really
has beautiful ears.

01:27:33.020 --> 01:27:34.940
Sarge.

01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:39.460
You want me? I'm here.
Let the girl go.

01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.740
Don't tell me
what to do, soldier.

01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:45.780
I give the orders
around here, and you're
gonna have to learn that.

01:27:47.620 --> 01:27:49.980
She's a fuckin'
gook traitor.

01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:54.340
I gave you an order to kill her.
Now you're gonna have to
fulfill that order. Private.

01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:58.100
Scott, the war...

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:00.180
is over.

01:28:01.540 --> 01:28:03.460
Not for me.

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.260
Not for her. Not for you.

01:28:48.820 --> 01:28:52.260
You can't run
from this war, soldier.

01:28:52.380 --> 01:28:55.860
Not under my command, huh?

01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:58.860
You've grown weak.

01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:02.980
You should've
taken your...

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:05.700
medication.

01:29:45.621 --> 01:29:47.861
Come on. Get up and fight.

01:29:57.701 --> 01:30:01.261
Now I'm gonna teach you about
the chain of command, private.

01:30:03.381 --> 01:30:06.021
When I say jump,

01:30:06.141 --> 01:30:10.141
you say, "How high?"
Got it? Got it?

01:30:10.301 --> 01:30:12.981
Why can't you get it
into your fucking head?

01:30:20.221 --> 01:30:23.381
I gave you
an order, soldier.

01:30:23.461 --> 01:30:27.141
Now let me see you
waste that gook traitor.

01:30:32.661 --> 01:30:35.901
Now where're we gonna
shoot her? In the stomach?

01:30:37.421 --> 01:30:39.861
Nah. In the chest?

01:30:41.461 --> 01:30:46.101
No. I think
we should shoot her...

01:30:46.221 --> 01:30:49.061
in the head!

01:30:50.221 --> 01:30:53.101
Ready. Fire!

01:30:56.661 --> 01:30:59.701
It's empty!

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.421
It's empty!

01:31:08.542 --> 01:31:10.582
Luc!

01:31:10.702 --> 01:31:12.742
Oh, God!

01:31:13.542 --> 01:31:15.942
Oh, God, help!

01:31:16.662 --> 01:31:18.662
Come on!

01:31:22.102 --> 01:31:24.582
- Luc!
- Run!

01:31:24.702 --> 01:31:27.022
No!

01:31:27.102 --> 01:31:29.422
Run!

01:31:34.622 --> 01:31:36.622
Run.

01:31:40.982 --> 01:31:43.462
No!

01:32:21.542 --> 01:32:23.462
Well, that's
the spirit, soldier.

01:32:37.982 --> 01:32:41.542
I mean, this is
a serious matter. Private.

01:32:41.662 --> 01:32:44.142
I can't believe you got your
poor folks involved in this too.

01:32:46.462 --> 01:32:50.902
Well, I got
a little secret for you, boy.
You're up for a court-martial.

01:32:53.342 --> 01:32:55.942
- You ready to go to trial?
- Give me your best shot.

01:33:14.903 --> 01:33:19.103
Gee, I'm awful sorry
about this, but you're
all sentenced to death.

01:33:24.143 --> 01:33:26.503
Say good night, asshole.

01:33:31.903 --> 01:33:33.823
Good night, asshole.

01:35:00.744 --> 01:35:03.904
You're dead, soldier.

01:35:03.984 --> 01:35:07.264
No. I'm alive.

01:36:29.704 --> 01:36:33.344
You're discharged, Sarge.

01:36:48.304 --> 01:36:52.384
- Luc, son.
- You okay, Dad? Mom?

01:36:52.544 --> 01:36:54.465
Don't worry about us.

01:36:57.945 --> 01:37:00.345
It's over, dear.

01:37:00.425 --> 01:37:02.625
Here, let me help you.

01:37:30.625 --> 01:37:32.625
Are you okay?

01:37:34.025 --> 01:37:36.785
I have a- I have a little
bit of a headache, but-

01:37:43.065 --> 01:37:46.585
- Where is he?
- Around.

01:37:48.265 --> 01:37:50.025
How do you feel?

01:37:51.905 --> 01:37:54.545
Like a 50-year-old.
