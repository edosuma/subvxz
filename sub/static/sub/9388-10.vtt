00:34.415 --> 00:36.933
Lois,...

00:36.968 --> 00:39.442
My...

00:39.477 --> 00:41.916
I'm...

00:41.917 --> 00:44.686
They...

00:44.721 --> 00:47.325
Wow...

00:47.360 --> 00:48.600
Meg, please,
I'm talking.

00:48.601 --> 00:51.938
Over a thousand people entered
the contest and they chose mine.

00:51.939 --> 00:53.701
Well, that's
wonderful, Brian.

00:53.736 --> 00:55.490
Yeah, that's
a great achievement.

00:55.497 --> 00:57.560
Just like the first
chemotherapy patient

00:57.564 --> 00:59.335
to figure out
the handkerchief look.

01:01.716 --> 01:03.367
Honey, get in here!

01:03.395 --> 01:04.218
What is it?

01:04.218 --> 01:05.612
Just... just get in here!

01:05.788 --> 01:06.571
What...?

01:06.598 --> 01:07.961
Oh, my God.

01:08.166 --> 01:08.830
Right.

01:08.835 --> 01:09.902
It's like you...

01:09.905 --> 01:11.551
Don't even have cancer!

01:11.596 --> 01:13.211
- I know.
- Oh, my God.

01:14.287 --> 01:16.602
No, but I still have
pretty aggressive cancer.

01:19.928 --> 01:20.652
Come on, Peter.

01:20.656 --> 01:22.652
We're gonna be late for lunch
with Mom and Dad.

01:23.717 --> 01:26.261
Oh. Right.

01:26.268 --> 01:27.643
You didn't forget,
did you?

01:27.646 --> 01:28.951
No, no, I didn't forget.

01:28.965 --> 01:30.960
Let me just go change
out of this fishing gear.

01:33.728 --> 01:34.900
Hey, Peter, what's up?

01:34.948 --> 01:35.753
Come on, come on,
we got to go now.

01:35.795 --> 01:37.402
We got to go now.
Come on, Joe! Joe! Quagmire!

01:37.437 --> 01:38.402
Come on.
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:38.436 --> 01:39.823
Pull the car around.
Come on, let's go.

01:42.628 --> 01:43.573
Hello?

01:43.866 --> 01:45.183
Lois, this is Peter.

01:45.475 --> 01:47.811
I'm afraid that on my way
to the bedroom to change,

01:47.818 --> 01:48.801
I took ill.

01:48.907 --> 01:50.620
You'd best go to lunch
without me.

01:50.625 --> 01:51.900
Why do I hear an engine?

01:52.005 --> 01:54.503
Uh... because my stomach
is rumbling in a way

01:54.508 --> 01:56.892
that sounds like the engine
of Joe's fishing truck.

01:56.897 --> 01:58.000
Peter, are you lying?

01:58.006 --> 01:59.643
Oh, now she's a doctor, guys.

01:59.756 --> 02:00.592
Hey, Lois!

02:00.607 --> 02:01.502
Quagmire says hi.

02:01.508 --> 02:03.620
Damn it, Peter, you're going
fishing, aren't you?

02:03.627 --> 02:06.213
You promised you'd come to lunch
with my parents today.

02:06.215 --> 02:08.770
Well, Lois, until we get
an appointment secretary,

02:08.815 --> 02:11.280
things like this are gonna continue
to fall through the cracks.

02:11.288 --> 02:13.862
My parents are not gonna
like this, Peter.

02:13.907 --> 02:16.573
You know they're still angry at
how you behaved at our wedding.

02:18.037 --> 02:20.811
You may now kiss the bride,
Kiss her?

02:21.086 --> 02:23.840
I am gonna
destroy her.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.912
Mom, are you still mad
at Dad about yesterday?

02:31.945 --> 02:33.140
Well, sort of.

02:33.185 --> 02:35.282
I mean, we planned that
lunch two weeks ago.

02:35.398 --> 02:36.923
But he promised
he'd go with me

02:36.936 --> 02:38.901
to put flowers on my
grandmother's grave

02:38.938 --> 02:40.870
this afternoon, so i guess it's all right.

02:40.918 --> 02:42.373
Peter, are you ready...?

02:42.745 --> 02:45.223
Oh. Right.

02:49.387 --> 02:52.383
So, uh, a lot of tension
with Peter lately, huh?

02:52.397 --> 02:54.281
Ugh, that's an
understatement, Brian.

02:54.285 --> 02:56.433
He's been incredibly
thoughtless lately.

02:56.438 --> 02:58.190
Even more so than usual.

02:58.396 --> 03:00.243
But tonight
is our sex night,

03:00.248 --> 03:03.250
and a little physical release
will do us both some good.

03:03.387 --> 03:05.943
Peter, are you...?
Oh, come on!

03:05.956 --> 03:08.823
Lois, I know it's late, but me and
the guys were going beekeeping.

03:08.826 --> 03:11.290
Oh, my God, what the
hell is wrong with you?!

03:11.297 --> 03:14.031
Whoa, someone just
yelled themselves

03:14.037 --> 03:15.963
out of honey with breakfast.

03:15.986 --> 03:18.931
I don't need honey, Peter,
I need a husband who wants

03:18.938 --> 03:20.153
to spend time with me.

03:20.218 --> 03:21.691
Can I make a suggestion?

03:21.826 --> 03:24.120
All you two have done
is argue about stuff

03:24.165 --> 03:25.241
for the past two weeks.

03:25.296 --> 03:27.310
It's my guess you could
use a vacation.

03:27.595 --> 03:29.033
Why don't you come out
to Martha's Vineyard

03:29.036 --> 03:30.691
and watch me accept my award.

03:30.726 --> 03:33.372
Wow, does that
sound wonderful.

03:33.376 --> 03:35.202
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that sounds expensive.

03:35.207 --> 03:37.250
Can't we just do something
fun here at the house?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.413
It's just as relaxing.

03:38.675 --> 03:42.183
Hey, guys, I've decided
I'm gonna take up the drums.

03:42.815 --> 03:44.380
I'll start packing.

03:57.075 --> 04:00.303
Look, Quagmire, we're only gonna
be on Martha's Vineyard for a couple days.

04:00.316 --> 04:01.752
Can't you just watch the kids?

04:02.397 --> 04:05.691
Aw, man, you're more of a
letdown than Fruit Stripe gum.

04:09.228 --> 04:10.472
What are we gonna do, Lois?

04:10.476 --> 04:12.921
re out of town.

04:12.928 --> 04:14.312
Well, what about Cleveland?

04:14.346 --> 04:16.853
He's on the road touring
with Black Box.

04:25.178 --> 04:29.102
Everybody, everybody
Everybody, everybody

04:29.557 --> 04:30.892
Well, wait a minute,
what about that

04:30.898 --> 04:32.671
nice old man who
lives up the street?

04:32.747 --> 04:35.160
Oh, yeah, maybe Herbert
could watch the kids.

04:35.168 --> 04:36.631
He seems like a responsible guy.

04:37.146 --> 04:40.383
So it would only be till Monday
and we could pay you for it.

04:40.496 --> 04:42.143
Yeah, and it's real easy,
I promise.

04:42.148 --> 04:44.460
I mean, you've spent time
watching children, right?

04:44.468 --> 04:46.323
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, I have.

04:46.367 --> 04:47.643
Wonderful.

04:57.128 --> 04:58.772
Brian, this is wonderful.

04:59.127 --> 05:00.620
I feel like one
of the Kennedys.

05:00.818 --> 05:02.793
You know, the overprivileged
drunk ones,

05:02.835 --> 05:04.782
not the socially responsible dead ones.

05:04.818 --> 05:06.910
You know, this resort offers
some wonderful amenities.

05:06.918 --> 05:10.113
They have bird watching, wine
tasting, horseback riding.

05:10.155 --> 05:11.953
Yeah, they also have
stork startling.

05:13.616 --> 05:16.122
Squawkety, squawkety, squawkety,
squawkety, squawkety, squawkety!

05:17.238 --> 05:21.591
Your bird intelligence is no match
for my people intelligence.

05:24.817 --> 05:27.381
All right, children,
your mammy and pappy

05:27.387 --> 05:30.393
asked me to look after you
for the next couple days.

05:30.428 --> 05:33.282
So I want to lay down
a few ground rules.

05:33.356 --> 05:35.570
No cussing,
clean your plates,

05:35.577 --> 05:39.722
and only a half hour of radio
and then it's off to bed.

05:39.726 --> 05:40.881
Well, that sucks.

05:40.885 --> 05:42.462
And don't you mouth off to me

05:42.497 --> 05:44.720
or I'm gonna slap you
right in your penis.

05:44.888 --> 05:47.573
No offense, Mr. Herbert,
but I'm a 17-year-old girl

05:47.575 --> 05:48.840
and I don't need you here.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.782
Well, no offense
to you, Meg,

05:50.807 --> 05:54.162
but you're a 17-year-old girl
and I don't need you here.

06:00.218 --> 06:01.830
What do you think's
keeping Peter?

06:02.085 --> 06:04.582
I hope he gets here before
they give you your award.

06:04.586 --> 06:05.780
Well, you're here, Lois.

06:05.788 --> 06:06.690
That's enough for me.

06:06.707 --> 06:09.993
Oh, you always know
just what to say.

06:10.246 --> 06:13.303
And now, reading a passage
from his grand prize-winning

06:13.315 --> 06:16.352
short essay, "Amazing Grace,"
tonight's guest of honor,

06:16.355 --> 06:17.913
Mr. Brian Griffin.

06:21.267 --> 06:22.240
Thank you very much.

06:23.295 --> 06:26.383
"She was grace in name
and in essence.

06:26.686 --> 06:29.021
"To those she loved,
she exuded strength,

06:29.026 --> 06:31.130
"life, laughter and light.

06:31.645 --> 06:33.432
"And to me, also sorrow.

06:33.686 --> 06:36.340
"For circumstance had bound her
to my best friend,

06:36.346 --> 06:39.931
"through whom we met in the
warmth and serenity of her home.

06:40.265 --> 06:42.481
"Nothing from the first day
I saw her

06:42.487 --> 06:44.571
"and no one that has
happened to me since

06:44.716 --> 06:47.361
"has ever been as frightening
and as confusing.

06:48.127 --> 06:50.773
"For no person I've ever known
has ever done more

06:50.776 --> 06:53.580
"to make me feel more sure,
more insecure,

06:53.904 --> 06:56.765
more important
and less significant. "

07:05.386 --> 07:07.327
That was beautiful,
Brian.

07:07.615 --> 07:09.089
Well, you know
what they say-

07:09.349 --> 07:10.612
write what's
in your heart.

07:10.956 --> 07:12.023
Hey, oh!

07:12.027 --> 07:15.271
Oh, did-did I miss
Byron's reward?

07:15.306 --> 07:16.601
Brian's award.

07:16.606 --> 07:18.140
And, yes, you did, Peter.

07:18.538 --> 07:20.563
You've been
a good son, Brian.

07:20.565 --> 07:22.970
And I'm sorry
you're so sick.

07:23.387 --> 07:24.030
What?

07:24.268 --> 07:25.770
Peter, where the hell
have you been?

07:25.847 --> 07:29.570
Every time that
we go to a hotel,

07:29.607 --> 07:32.083
you hide the key to
the minibar from me.

07:32.438 --> 07:34.192
But I found it.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.280
Found it.

07:37.078 --> 07:38.990
You're a piece of
work, you know that?

07:38.996 --> 07:40.843
An hour late
and you're drunk.

07:40.846 --> 07:43.902
You had an opportunity to share
a beautiful moment with Brian

07:43.905 --> 07:47.893
and you wasted it, wasted it like
the Osmond family wastes water.

07:49.375 --> 07:51.542
Who's in the shower?
Is it Donny?

07:51.725 --> 07:54.182
No, I showered earlier.
It could be Meryl.

07:54.186 --> 07:55.593
Meryl's right here.

07:55.955 --> 07:57.023
Well, where's Jimmy?

07:57.036 --> 07:59.270
Jimmy's running through
the sprinklers in the yard.

07:59.728 --> 08:00.723
Is it Marie?

08:00.728 --> 08:02.501
No, no one's in there.

08:02.507 --> 08:05.673
So the shower's just running
with no one in there?

08:05.677 --> 08:06.470
That's right.

08:06.656 --> 08:08.692
Well, I'll be
a son of a gun.

08:14.576 --> 08:15.801
Hey.
Good morning.

08:15.807 --> 08:17.310
Oh, good morning, Brian.

08:17.838 --> 08:20.502
Ooh, that's a lovely
fragrance you're wearing.

08:20.547 --> 08:21.290
What is it?

08:21.336 --> 08:21.942
Oh, this?

08:21.948 --> 08:24.282
This is Hartz-Mountain
flea dip.

08:24.287 --> 08:26.203
Kills ticks, fleas,
and mosquitoes.

08:26.205 --> 08:27.183
It's very potent.

08:27.357 --> 08:29.592
Almost as potent as
the inspiration you give me

08:29.597 --> 08:32.020
to plumb the deepest
fathoms of my soul

08:32.025 --> 08:34.842
for a literary bounty
of truth and loveliness.

08:38.325 --> 08:40.520
Aah! That's
so much better.

08:42.076 --> 08:43.159
Ah, morning, Lois.

08:43.615 --> 08:45.090
I'm sorry about
last night.

08:45.178 --> 08:46.721
I promise I'll
make it up to you.

08:46.725 --> 08:48.470
Well, if you really
mean that,

08:48.506 --> 08:51.311
I was hoping we could go
paddle boating today.

08:51.338 --> 08:52.710
Great, but can we
do it after 5:00?

08:52.728 --> 08:53.780
There's a ballgame on.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.722
Oh, well, then, maybe
Brian and I can hang out.

08:56.725 --> 08:57.701
Do you mind, Brian?

08:57.807 --> 08:58.881
No, not at all.

08:58.888 --> 09:01.320
Good, now can you move, please?
You're blocking the screen.

09:01.348 --> 09:02.260
We now return to

09:02.266 --> 09:05.281
Damn, Nature, You Scary
on BET.

09:05.515 --> 09:06.750
Damn, look at that
son-bitch go.

09:06.755 --> 09:07.731
He hauling ass.

09:08.627 --> 09:10.700
That thing come by my house,
I kill it.

09:13.885 --> 09:15.791
That little rat looking thing
just got ate.

09:15.837 --> 09:17.940
Damn, Nature, you scary!

10:50.975 --> 10:52.702
Y'all know
what day it is?

10:52.707 --> 10:53.250
No.

10:53.296 --> 10:54.933
It's bath day.

10:54.985 --> 10:57.300
I don't want to take a bath.

10:57.826 --> 11:01.090
Not for you, silly.
It's bath day forme.

11:01.386 --> 11:03.001
But I can't wash myself.

11:03.265 --> 11:06.142
Know anybody with a pair
of strong, young hands

11:06.185 --> 11:07.971
to help me in and
out of the tub?

11:08.965 --> 11:10.522
Aw, rats!

11:14.798 --> 11:17.122
Oh, I had so much
fun today, Brian.

11:17.345 --> 11:18.242
So did I.

11:18.376 --> 11:20.051
Hey, you feel like
grabbing something to eat?

11:20.096 --> 11:21.603
Oh, I'd love to,
but Peter and I

11:21.605 --> 11:24.123
were gonna get dinner at
that little place by the...

11:25.315 --> 11:27.963
Lois...

11:27.967 --> 11:30.970
Went to...

11:31.218 --> 11:33.870
Well... looks
like lamfree.

11:33.987 --> 11:35.421
Hey, you know
what might be fun?

11:35.517 --> 11:36.940
How about we just
order room service

11:36.946 --> 11:38.802
and watch a couple
of bad movies?

11:38.988 --> 11:40.513
Yeah, that does
sound like fun.

11:40.516 --> 11:41.860
I'll go rentVanilla Sky.

11:41.868 --> 11:44.410
I said a bad movie,
not an abortion.

11:47.667 --> 11:50.232
Ah, this is gonna be great-
a whole evening with Lois!

11:50.236 --> 11:51.821
We are gonna have
such a fun time.

11:51.896 --> 11:52.730
Lois, my darling!

11:52.768 --> 11:55.790
Couple of steaks, some wine,
maybe a couple of sundaes...

11:55.888 --> 11:56.853
Lois, my darling!

11:57.117 --> 11:58.822
...little music,
some candlelight.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.213
Lois, my darling!

12:01.505 --> 12:04.632
What am I doing?
This is Lois, Peter's wife.

12:04.768 --> 12:07.123
H- How can I even think
about trying anything?

12:08.546 --> 12:09.070
Hello?

12:09.076 --> 12:11.251
Hey, Brian, it's me.
I got a question for you.

12:11.298 --> 12:13.293
Herbert and I
are playing Scattergories.

12:13.296 --> 12:16.152
Would you count Nyquil
as a beverage?

12:17.006 --> 12:18.202
- No, right?
- No.

12:18.205 --> 12:20.220
Yeah, not gonna fly, old man.
Thanks, Brian.

12:20.268 --> 12:24.000
Damn it! I'm missing
Boy Meets Worldfor this?

12:28.485 --> 12:30.150
This is so much fun, Brian.

12:30.197 --> 12:31.823
Well, it's a
Saturday night-

12:31.827 --> 12:34.000
sorry the video store
pickings were a little sparse.

12:34.077 --> 12:35.441
Hope you like
Roman Holiday.

12:35.696 --> 12:37.380
Tee-hee! I lied.

12:37.385 --> 12:39.192
I was a princess
the whole time.

12:39.197 --> 12:40.130
You bitch!

12:40.165 --> 12:42.170
I'm gonna punch you
in the face!

12:42.685 --> 12:44.702
Ah, that was
a lovely dinner.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.980
I saved all my scraps
in a bag for you.

12:46.986 --> 12:50.901
Thanks. You know, Lois,
I'm sure you've already

12:50.917 --> 12:52.140
figured this out, but...

12:52.285 --> 12:55.442
that essay I wrote-
I wrote it about you.

12:55.636 --> 12:59.891
Aw... I had a hunch.
Thank you, Brian.

13:00.208 --> 13:02.170
I'm glad you
shared that with me.

13:02.286 --> 13:04.762
Well, you know, Lois,
you mean a lot to me.

13:04.768 --> 13:07.431
I mean, things you say
and things you do

13:07.435 --> 13:09.471
resonate with me
in a big way.

13:09.976 --> 13:11.540
When you drive away
to go to the market,

13:11.546 --> 13:13.641
I just don't know what
to do with myself.

13:13.827 --> 13:14.921
And then when
I hear that car

13:14.966 --> 13:17.253
coming up the driveway,
I just go berserk.

13:17.257 --> 13:19.792
I mean, you know, half the time, when
you go to the market,

13:19.837 --> 13:22.503
I just assume you're
leaving forever, and when you get back,

13:22.546 --> 13:25.181
I realize I have no idea
how long you've been gone, and I...

13:26.146 --> 13:27.621
Well, you know what,
I'm-I'm rambling. I...

13:28.117 --> 13:29.680
Would you like
some more champagne?

13:29.725 --> 13:30.921
I'd love some.

13:33.206 --> 13:34.941
Ah! My head is swimming.

13:37.365 --> 13:39.260
Oh, my God!
Brian, no!

13:39.478 --> 13:40.630
Now, stop it!

13:40.707 --> 13:41.700
What are you doing?!

13:41.706 --> 13:42.870
I can't help myself, Lois!

13:42.976 --> 13:44.711
I know you're married to
Peter, but I love you and

13:44.755 --> 13:46.020
I can't stand it anymore!

13:46.665 --> 13:47.761
Brian, no!

13:47.767 --> 13:49.600
No! Get down! Get down!

13:50.055 --> 13:51.511
This is a good sweater!

13:54.838 --> 13:56.581
Brian, I think
you'd better go.

14:04.258 --> 14:06.610
Lois, I'd really like
to talk about this.

14:08.077 --> 14:10.103
No! Stop scratching
the door!

14:14.165 --> 14:15.720
Oh, my God, I attacked Lois!

14:16.198 --> 14:18.181
What the hell was I thinking?
I'm a rapist!

14:18.187 --> 14:19.412
I'm-I'm no better than...

14:19.417 --> 14:22.190
Kobe Bryant or Mike Tyson
or Reagan!

14:23.448 --> 14:25.570
Hey, Brian, another
Scattergories question.

14:25.578 --> 14:29.490
The category is "Type of Pet. "
Herbert put "Cambodian. "

14:29.528 --> 14:30.710
That's not right, right?

14:30.717 --> 14:32.890
Look, Stewie, I can't talk
about this now, all right?

14:32.895 --> 14:34.173
Geez, what's
yourproblem?

14:34.175 --> 14:35.160
I- I just...

14:35.167 --> 14:38.723
I did a bad thing,
and I don't know what to do about it.

14:39.108 --> 14:40.961
I feel like
I'm losing my mind.

14:40.988 --> 14:43.721
Ugh! That's howlfelt at
that Grateful Dead show.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.803
Does anybody want
to buy my shirt?!

14:47.007 --> 14:49.840
I'll trade you my shirt
for a grilled cheese!

14:50.195 --> 14:51.563
So, what happened, sport?

14:51.965 --> 14:54.283
Come on, talk to
your pal, Stewie.

14:54.326 --> 14:55.380
All right, but only because

14:55.385 --> 14:56.411
I've got to tell somebody.

14:57.516 --> 15:00.541
I- I pretty much just
threw myself at Lois.

15:00.598 --> 15:02.723
So, you finally
did it, huh?

15:03.306 --> 15:05.101
Well, look, Brian,
as your friend,

15:05.178 --> 15:06.360
I- I should tell you

15:06.366 --> 15:08.250
that that vagina is ground zero, man.

15:08.256 --> 15:09.060
I mean, I-I just...

15:09.066 --> 15:10.651
I wrecked that thing
on the way out.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.070
And just to be a jerk,

15:12.076 --> 15:14.120
I carved "Brooks was here" in the wall.

15:14.905 --> 15:16.090
Did-did you see that?

15:17.086 --> 15:18.310
Did you see
"Brooks was here"?

15:18.316 --> 15:19.310
We didn't have sex.

15:19.315 --> 15:20.813
'Course, what with
Chris going before me,

15:20.816 --> 15:22.703
I pretty much just
walked out of there.

15:23.058 --> 15:24.273
Didn't even have
to stoop over.

15:24.805 --> 15:26.071
There was even room to

15:26.078 --> 15:27.613
twirl a cane as I strolled.

15:27.626 --> 15:28.402
You're exaggerating.

15:28.478 --> 15:31.063
Only a little bit-
that's the messed-up thing.

15:35.298 --> 15:36.063
Morning, Lois.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.332
Peter, there you are.

15:37.585 --> 15:39.843
Were you down at that hotel bar
all night again?

15:39.845 --> 15:42.080
I was, Lois- and you know
who's staying at this hotel?

15:42.087 --> 15:43.433
Nathan Lane!

15:43.436 --> 15:45.472
We got wasted at the bar,
and he ended up

15:45.476 --> 15:46.550
asking me to marry him.

15:46.557 --> 15:48.572
So I convinced this
minister to do the job,

15:48.577 --> 15:49.900
but the joke's on Nathan Lane,

15:49.916 --> 15:51.610
'cause gay people
can't get married!

15:51.677 --> 15:53.531
They can in this
state, Peter.

15:54.896 --> 15:57.610
Well, in that case,
we're registered at Filene's.

15:57.615 --> 16:00.760
God, you've spent half
this entire trip intoxicated!

16:00.808 --> 16:02.901
Oh, I'm intoxicated
all right, Lois-

16:02.946 --> 16:04.371
by the beauty and magic

16:04.378 --> 16:05.692
of Martha's Vineyard.

16:05.857 --> 16:07.310
Nantucket, Cape Cod,

16:07.316 --> 16:09.512
and all the great destinations

16:09.548 --> 16:10.772
that make Massachusetts

16:10.777 --> 16:12.102
the wondrous place it is.

16:13.197 --> 16:15.103
<i>The spirit of Massachusetts</i>

16:15.107 --> 16:16.803
<i>is the spirit of America</i>

16:16.806 --> 16:18.953
<i>The spirit of what's old</i>

16:18.958 --> 16:20.203
<i>and what's new</i>

16:20.485 --> 16:22.520
<i>The spirit of Massachusetts</i>

16:22.525 --> 16:24.333
<i>is the spirit of America</i>

16:24.336 --> 16:27.690
<i>The spirit
of the red, white and blue.</i>

16:29.898 --> 16:30.893
I am so glad Brian

16:30.895 --> 16:32.331
brought us out here, Lois.

16:32.337 --> 16:34.050
He's a real pal,
you know that?

16:34.056 --> 16:35.540
Well, it's actually Brian

16:35.545 --> 16:37.213
I need to talk to you about.

16:37.217 --> 16:39.093
Boy, he's a hell
of a guy, isn't he?

16:39.135 --> 16:41.361
He's the one guy
I know I can trust.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.253
Brian tried
to have sex with me.

16:45.195 --> 16:46.393
Was he bigger than me?

16:50.118 --> 16:51.531
"... and they told Peter

16:51.538 --> 16:53.122
to stay away from the wolf.

16:53.225 --> 16:55.150
But he didn't
listen to them... "

16:55.158 --> 16:56.861
'cause he's his own man.

16:57.226 --> 17:00.250
And he knew that sometimes
the things that seem

17:00.257 --> 17:02.640
the most dangerous turn out

17:02.707 --> 17:04.330
to be the most fun!

17:04.545 --> 17:06.732
Yes, sir, it was a good day

17:06.734 --> 17:08.032
for young Peter.

17:18.336 --> 17:19.811
Are you a pedophile?

17:26.768 --> 17:27.470
Hey, uh...

17:28.288 --> 17:29.250
Lois told me there was

17:29.255 --> 17:30.132
some funny business.

17:30.135 --> 17:31.133
Yeah, what of it?

17:31.136 --> 17:31.970
Well, it's just...

17:31.976 --> 17:34.370
I can't help but feel
a little betrayed, Brian.

17:34.475 --> 17:36.743
Lois is my wife,
and... well, I mean,

17:36.758 --> 17:37.970
all the dry food I've bought

17:37.976 --> 17:38.972
for you over the years?

17:38.977 --> 17:40.902
Yeah, well, you don't
deserve her, you know that?

17:40.906 --> 17:41.472
Say what, now?

17:41.476 --> 17:42.901
You don't deserve her.

17:42.905 --> 17:45.203
She does nothing
but give and give and give,

17:45.245 --> 17:46.072
and you repay her

17:46.086 --> 17:47.500
with selfishness and neglect.

17:47.517 --> 17:48.770
I mean, you've barely spent

17:48.778 --> 17:50.750
any time with her at
all on this vacation.

17:50.756 --> 17:52.052
Well, who the hell are you to

17:52.057 --> 17:53.441
tell me how to run my marriage?

17:53.446 --> 17:54.941
You can't even hang on
to a girlfriend

17:54.986 --> 17:55.973
for more than a couple months!

17:55.977 --> 17:57.373
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

17:57.375 --> 18:00.202
Oh, you're a freakin' train
wreck with that crap, Brian.

18:00.247 --> 18:01.852
You couldn't even get
Gillian to take you back,

18:01.857 --> 18:03.801
and she was dumber
than Lou Ferrigno.

18:35.645 --> 18:36.932
Stop it!
Stop it!

18:36.935 --> 18:38.181
Get off my husband!

18:38.225 --> 18:39.430
Wait a minute, Brian.

18:39.758 --> 18:42.582
Nathan Lane is right.
What are we doing?

18:42.727 --> 18:44.523
Look, I'm sorry, all right?

18:44.526 --> 18:47.360
It's just... wh-when
you have feelings for someone

18:47.367 --> 18:48.843
that are strong enough,
you just...

18:49.948 --> 18:52.250
I don't know, lose sight
of the rest of the world.

18:52.318 --> 18:54.163
Brian, she's my wife.

18:54.588 --> 18:55.901
And you're my best pal.

18:56.586 --> 18:58.372
So what are we
gonna do about this?

18:59.746 --> 19:03.511
I promise, Peter,
nothing like this will ever happen again.

19:04.457 --> 19:05.583
Thanks, old buddy.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.211
Yeah, blah, blah, blah!

19:07.246 --> 19:08.503
That's all well and good, Peter.

19:08.508 --> 19:10.152
Now, get ready, we're having

19:10.158 --> 19:11.750
dinner with my parents tonight!

19:12.348 --> 19:15.013
Oh. Right.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.490
I just feel terrible
about this whole thing, Lois.

19:21.835 --> 19:23.043
Can you ever forgive me?

19:23.088 --> 19:25.671
Yes, Brian, I can.

19:26.175 --> 19:27.243
But there's something

19:27.246 --> 19:28.250
you deserve to know.

19:28.255 --> 19:29.002
What's that?

19:29.207 --> 19:29.692
Well...

19:30.595 --> 19:33.061
it's not like I haven't
thought about it.

19:33.176 --> 19:33.883
Really?

19:33.907 --> 19:37.561
Well,yes. I mean,
you and I have a lot in common,

19:37.607 --> 19:38.902
and we've spent so much time

19:38.906 --> 19:40.340
together over the years, and...

19:41.065 --> 19:45.100
of course, that essay you wrote,
oh, it really touched my heart.

19:45.176 --> 19:47.551
Well, to be honest, Lois,
I ripped off

19:47.555 --> 19:49.841
most of that speech
from Summer of '42.

19:50.056 --> 19:53.031
Well, it was still nice.

19:53.166 --> 19:54.392
Let me just ask you this.

19:54.585 --> 19:56.112
When these thoughts about you

19:56.117 --> 19:57.640
and I have crossed your mind,

19:57.787 --> 19:59.950
is it... good?

20:00.055 --> 20:00.942
What do you mean?

20:01.016 --> 20:02.340
Well, uh, uh...

20:03.396 --> 20:04.170
Yeah.

20:04.215 --> 20:06.233
Well, a lot of times when Peter and

20:06.237 --> 20:08.321
I are having sex, I feel suffocated.

20:08.326 --> 20:09.421
But with you, I imagine

20:09.427 --> 20:10.620
it would be like doing it

20:10.625 --> 20:12.060
with a stuffed animal.

20:12.205 --> 20:13.412
Everybody ready to go?

20:13.516 --> 20:14.481
All set, Peter.

20:14.496 --> 20:15.461
Good.

20:16.266 --> 20:18.191
Well, we may be leaving
Martha's Vineyard,

20:18.197 --> 20:19.883
but the spirit
of this wonderful place

20:19.888 --> 20:21.323
will stay in our hearts

20:21.328 --> 20:22.382
all the way home.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.863
'Cause after all...

20:24.315 --> 20:26.281
