00:07.966 --> 00:09.176
Hey, Otis!

00:09.259 --> 00:11.094
-Otis
-Otis!

00:11.178 --> 00:14.306
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:14.389 --> 00:15.641
Hit the brakes!

00:15.724 --> 00:17.559
-Otis
-Otis!

00:17.643 --> 00:20.729
Let's get rolling with Otis

00:20.812 --> 00:21.897
Let's get rolling!

00:21.980 --> 00:24.900
Together on the farm
We play and we work hard

00:24.983 --> 00:28.111
-With help from Otis the tractor
-Yeah!

00:28.195 --> 00:31.365
When he feels his heart glowing
Otis gets going

00:31.448 --> 00:34.576
-So let's get rolling with Otis
-Otis!

00:37.788 --> 00:40.415
"Celeste's Pumpkin Problem."

00:43.043 --> 00:44.753
Calling all pumpkins!

00:44.837 --> 00:47.673
The Biggest Pumpkin Contest is
about to start.

00:51.218 --> 00:54.596
Hopping hay bales!
I better get my pumpkin to the barn.

00:59.059 --> 01:03.188
Sweet pumpkin pie!
That's one big pumpkin, Daisy.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.272
Thanks.

01:06.316 --> 01:10.028
Moo-wow! Yours is huge too, Otis.

01:10.112 --> 01:14.199
Cock-a-doodle-'scuse me.
Big pumpkin coming through.

01:30.132 --> 01:32.926
Time to find out
who grew the biggest pumpkin

01:33.010 --> 01:35.429
and gets the pumpkin prize.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.392
-Who grew the biggest one, Louie? Who?
-Yeah.

01:40.475 --> 01:42.978
My trusty measuring stick will
let us know.

01:45.731 --> 01:47.024
I can't wait!

01:47.107 --> 01:48.233
Who's it gonna be?

01:48.317 --> 01:50.944
-They're all so big.
-Let's see.

01:51.028 --> 01:52.905
I hope it's mine.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.823
Wait!

01:54.907 --> 01:56.450
Celeste isn't here.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.077
Where is she?

01:59.161 --> 02:01.496
-I haven't seen her.
-Me neither.

02:01.580 --> 02:02.998
I'll go look for her.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.209
Thanks, Otis.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.211
Where could Celeste be?

02:12.925 --> 02:14.343
I know!

02:16.011 --> 02:18.597
Don't start the contest without us, Louie.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.642
Okay. But please hurry.

02:23.519 --> 02:26.813
Celeste? Celeste?

02:30.776 --> 02:33.111
Great gargantuan gourd!

02:33.195 --> 02:35.113
This pumpkin is humongous!

02:39.159 --> 02:40.827
Move.

02:40.911 --> 02:45.624
Hold the hay.
Is the pumpkin talking to me?

02:46.333 --> 02:48.919
-Otis?
-Pumpkin?

02:49.002 --> 02:51.964
I didn't know pumpkins could talk.

02:53.799 --> 02:55.926
Or oink. Wait.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.014
Is that you, Celeste?

03:01.098 --> 03:02.099
Yep.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.142
What are you doing?

03:04.226 --> 03:10.274
Trying to get my pumpkin to the contest.

03:14.111 --> 03:17.531
It's a really big pumpkin.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.450
Right? Isn't it beautiful?

03:21.368 --> 03:24.079
How did it get so big?

03:24.162 --> 03:26.248
I'm so happy you asked.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.792
First, I planted a seed.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.502
Like this one.

03:31.086 --> 03:35.382
Then I watered it
and sang it my special song.

03:36.592 --> 03:40.137
Oink, oink, oink, I'm a little pig

03:40.220 --> 03:44.057
But soon I'll have a pumpkin
That's really big

03:44.558 --> 03:47.144
Pumpkins just love it
when you sing to them.

03:47.227 --> 03:50.731
And I gave my pumpkin lots of love.

03:52.065 --> 03:56.570
And then it grew and grew and grew
to this!

03:57.404 --> 03:58.405
Wow!

03:58.488 --> 04:02.409
You're definitely gonna win
the Biggest Pumpkin Contest, Celeste.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.871
Well…

04:08.457 --> 04:12.544
I don't think so.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.173
Hit the brakes. Why not, Celeste?

04:17.257 --> 04:21.470
It's too big to move.

04:24.306 --> 04:27.434
If I can't get my pumpkin to the contest,

04:27.518 --> 04:29.811
there's no way I can win.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.980
I'm so frustrated!

04:35.400 --> 04:36.693
I'm a hearty helper.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.449
There must be a way
to get it to the contest.

04:44.201 --> 04:46.662
Can we try moving it together, Celeste?

04:47.287 --> 04:49.373
Yes, yes, yes, please!

04:49.456 --> 04:51.458
Then let's get rolling.

04:59.049 --> 05:00.717
I see the problem.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.594
Your pumpkin's stuck in here.

05:02.678 --> 05:07.140
I'll use my forklift to lift it out
so we can get it to the barn.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.309
We're going to the contest!

05:13.021 --> 05:15.649
Which way should I go?

05:17.776 --> 05:18.902
This way.

05:20.279 --> 05:22.072
No. The other way.

05:22.948 --> 05:25.367
Oops. No. The other-other way.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.122
Oh, no!

05:30.205 --> 05:33.542
Pumpkin!

05:33.625 --> 05:36.003
No! It's gonna break!

05:36.587 --> 05:38.088
Not if I can help it!

05:41.341 --> 05:44.011
Putt, puff, puttedy pocks.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.930
We'll stop that pumpkin
from hitting those rocks.

05:48.932 --> 05:51.894
Great gears! We can use those tires.

05:58.358 --> 05:59.359
We did it!

06:01.778 --> 06:04.323
Otis, we saved my pumpkin.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.366
But…

06:07.784 --> 06:09.745
Oh, no.

06:09.828 --> 06:12.414
We're on the wrong side of the hill.

06:15.042 --> 06:19.171
We'll never get it to the barn
for the Biggest Pumpkin Contest.

06:21.006 --> 06:23.258
Sorry, pumpkin pal.

06:23.342 --> 06:24.927
I think we could've won.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.180
I know. I'm disappointed too.

06:35.187 --> 06:38.941
Celeste, I can try
to push it up the hill with my scoop.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.444
Oh, Otis! Yes, yes, yes!

06:46.949 --> 06:49.117
Let's get rolling.

06:50.035 --> 06:53.247
Putt, puff, puttedy mill.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.334
I'll move the pumpkin up this hill.

06:58.919 --> 07:03.340
-You can do it, Otis!
-I can do this.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.010
Go, Otis! Go! You're almost there.

07:10.180 --> 07:14.268
Putt, puff, puttedy mill.

07:14.351 --> 07:19.106
I'll move this pumpkin up this…

07:19.189 --> 07:20.399
Hill!

07:22.317 --> 07:25.487
We made it to the top.
We made it to the top!

07:27.155 --> 07:28.699
We sure did.

07:29.616 --> 07:34.788
Look, pumpkin.
Soon everybody will see how big you are.

07:34.872 --> 07:39.084
Let's go slowly. Okay, pumpkin?

07:40.127 --> 07:45.799
-Really slowly.
-Really slowly.

07:47.259 --> 07:50.220
Too fast, pumpkin. Too fast!

07:50.804 --> 07:53.599
Uh-oh! It's heading
straight for the other pumpkins!

07:53.682 --> 07:56.435
No! It's gonna crash!

07:56.518 --> 07:58.312
We've gotta stop that pumpkin!

08:01.064 --> 08:02.274
Watch out!

08:02.357 --> 08:05.444
-Runaway pumpkin!
-Out of the way!

08:05.527 --> 08:07.029
Watch out!

08:11.658 --> 08:14.578
Now, that's a big pumpkin.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.163
Pumpkin on the loose!

08:17.331 --> 08:19.124
Giant pumpkin coming through.

08:19.208 --> 08:20.751
Move out of the way!

08:22.377 --> 08:25.589
Quick, everyone, save your pumpkins.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.929
Cock-a-doodle-oh, no!

08:35.224 --> 08:37.392
Thanks for the warning, Otis.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.312
Gotta go faster.

08:43.607 --> 08:44.608
No!

08:44.691 --> 08:46.860
It's heading right for that wagon.

08:47.653 --> 08:49.029
Think, Otis. Think.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.823
I've got it! My winch!

08:59.915 --> 09:01.500
It's gonna hit the cart!

09:02.042 --> 09:03.418
I can't watch.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.420
Come on, pumpkin.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.468
-Baa-eautiful save.
-Way to moo-ve.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.053
Cock-a-doodle-did it!

09:13.136 --> 09:16.098
Otis, you saved it! You saved it!

09:19.268 --> 09:22.145
Let's get it
to the Biggest Pumpkin Contest.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.106
Farm-tastic.

09:31.113 --> 09:33.574
Let's put it right here.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.204
One stick.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.126
Two sticks.

09:50.757 --> 09:51.758
Thanks, Otis.

09:52.885 --> 09:54.553
Three sticks high.

09:58.182 --> 10:01.768
By my measurements, I can definitively say

10:01.852 --> 10:05.397
that this is the biggest pumpkin
in the contest.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.399
Congratulations.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.193
-Yeah!
-All right!

10:09.860 --> 10:11.945
Celeste, you won!

10:12.446 --> 10:15.365
Yay! I'm so happy, I could spin!

10:18.702 --> 10:20.662
Whoo-moo, Celeste.

10:21.246 --> 10:23.999
How'd you get your pumpkin to be so big?

10:24.082 --> 10:26.793
I sang to it, like this.

10:27.503 --> 10:30.714
Oink, oink, oink, I'm a little pig

10:30.797 --> 10:34.635
And now I have a pumpkin
That is really big

10:36.178 --> 10:39.806
And I couldn't have gotten it here
without your help, Otis.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.435
Celeste.

10:43.519 --> 10:45.938
On this farm, we all help each other.

10:47.356 --> 10:50.692
This is for you, Celeste.
Hooray for our winner.

10:52.819 --> 10:56.031
Did you hear that, pumpkin? We won!

11:04.456 --> 11:07.751
Oh, no! Celeste, your pumpkin.

11:10.379 --> 11:11.630
It's okay.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.424
Now there's enough to share with everyone.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.509
Dig in!

11:17.302 --> 11:18.303
Yum!

11:18.387 --> 11:20.430
-So good!
-Yummy!

11:21.557 --> 11:24.977
Not only is it the biggest pumpkin,

11:25.060 --> 11:27.229
but it's also the most delicious.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.151
The yummiest pumpkin ever!

11:33.235 --> 11:35.070
-Scrumptious!
-So good!

11:39.199 --> 11:41.201
"Quest To Save The Nest."

11:49.459 --> 11:52.254
Plowing the field, plowing the field

11:52.337 --> 11:54.381
Plow, plow, plow, plow, plow

11:59.803 --> 12:00.804
Tweet, tweet?

12:22.242 --> 12:24.578
Where are those tweets coming from?

12:35.797 --> 12:37.424
There's a nest on the door.

12:42.721 --> 12:44.389
Hi there, Mama Bird.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.767
And hello, little eggs.

12:51.355 --> 12:53.106
They're gonna hatch soon?

12:57.569 --> 13:00.864
I can't wait
to meet your little baby birds.

13:01.448 --> 13:06.286
Baby birds, baby birds
Soon we're gonna meet the baby birds

13:16.338 --> 13:17.714
What is that?

13:18.966 --> 13:20.050
Hit the brakes!

13:22.135 --> 13:25.055
All this rumbling's gonna
make the nest fall!

13:27.558 --> 13:30.644
I'm worried about your nest too.
How can I help?

13:36.275 --> 13:40.654
Okay. I'll hold the door steady
so your nest won't fall.

13:46.410 --> 13:47.619
Kevin!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.834
Kevin!

13:57.546 --> 13:58.547
Otis!

13:59.423 --> 14:00.883
Whatcha doing?

14:02.843 --> 14:04.970
I was protecting this nest.

14:05.971 --> 14:07.181
Hi, Mama Bird.

14:08.557 --> 14:10.976
Look at those wittle bitty eggs.

14:12.561 --> 14:15.314
I can't wait to meet them when they hatch.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.696
They're gonna hatch soon?

14:22.779 --> 14:26.450
Yep. But your bumping and vrooming was
making the nest shake.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.705
We have to be really careful
so it doesn't fall.

14:34.082 --> 14:35.334
Gotcha, Otis.

14:36.793 --> 14:38.754
I have to move all those hay bales.

14:38.837 --> 14:41.465
But I'll be careful
not to bounce the nest.

14:41.548 --> 14:44.092
I can't wait to meet your babies,
Mama Bird.

14:49.598 --> 14:50.974
See ya later.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.860
Hiya, Polly-pup.

15:03.111 --> 15:04.863
I can't play right now.

15:04.947 --> 15:08.867
I'm watching Mama Bird's nest.
Her babies are gonna hatch soon.

15:13.914 --> 15:15.290
I know you're hungry.

15:16.333 --> 15:20.003
I'll get the snacks.
They're right over here in the barn.

15:21.296 --> 15:22.714
If he opens the door,

15:23.382 --> 15:24.800
the nest will fall.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.426
Sal! Don't move!

15:32.057 --> 15:33.141
Can I move now?

15:34.476 --> 15:35.561
Sure, Sal.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.523
But you can't open that door!

15:40.232 --> 15:41.233
Yes, I can.

15:41.316 --> 15:45.404
I just pull it open like I always do.

15:45.487 --> 15:50.200
No, Sal. We can't open it
because there's a nest in the door.

15:50.284 --> 15:52.536
A nest? In the door?

15:55.706 --> 15:57.666
Look at those little eggs.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.549
Did you see the little crack, Otis?

16:05.632 --> 16:07.426
The eggs are gonna hatch soon.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.761
I will not touch that door.

16:12.806 --> 16:16.018
There's just one problem.

16:16.101 --> 16:18.228
All the chicken feed is in the barn.

16:19.855 --> 16:22.357
And it's the chicks' snack time.

16:22.441 --> 16:25.152
Look at those sad chickie faces.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.950
Chickies, we'll get your snack.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.035
But how?

16:35.537 --> 16:38.248
Putt, puff, puttedy pink.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.586
I need to take a deep breath and think.

16:47.007 --> 16:50.511
Now, what can we use to get that snack?

16:53.597 --> 16:54.598
No.

16:56.016 --> 16:57.017
No.

17:01.355 --> 17:02.356
No.

17:05.233 --> 17:06.359
Yes!

17:06.443 --> 17:08.028
Sal!

17:08.111 --> 17:12.950
If I move that hay elevator to the window,
could you get in the barn that way?

17:16.912 --> 17:20.332
Yes. Let's cock-a-doodle-do it.

17:20.415 --> 17:21.916
Let's get rolling.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.421
I love it when he says that.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.856
There you go, Sal.

17:45.315 --> 17:46.859
-Ready?
-Ready.

17:51.071 --> 17:53.699
I'll be back
with your snacks soon, chickies.

18:00.622 --> 18:01.707
Here I go.

18:09.506 --> 18:12.509
Hello, chicken feed.
You're coming with me.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.189
-Did you get it, Sal?
-Sure did!

18:26.106 --> 18:27.733
I mean, sure did.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.655
That was a farm-tastic idea. Thanks, Otis.

18:34.198 --> 18:35.616
See ya later, Mama Bird.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.545
It looks like they're gonna hatch soon.

18:48.629 --> 18:53.383
Baby birds, baby birds
Soon we're gonna meet the baby birds

18:55.302 --> 18:58.305
Kevin, the baby birds are about to hatch.

19:00.307 --> 19:03.560
I have to unload all this hay,
but I'll come right back.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.979
Just gotta grab this one last hay bale.

19:11.527 --> 19:12.861
The door!

19:14.655 --> 19:15.656
The nest!

19:17.199 --> 19:19.576
-Gotta vroom.
-Kevin!

19:23.914 --> 19:26.208
Hit the brakes! Kevin, wait!

19:30.963 --> 19:33.590
Oh, no. Mama Bird sounds so scared.

19:36.051 --> 19:38.762
Let's get rolling to save that nest.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.182
Kevin! Stop!

19:44.226 --> 19:45.769
Don't toss out that hay!

19:47.813 --> 19:49.439
Kevin!

19:55.612 --> 19:57.197
He can't hear me.

20:00.659 --> 20:02.327
Gotta go faster.

20:02.411 --> 20:07.541
Putt, puff, puttedy best.
I'll catch up to Kevin and save that nest.

20:25.893 --> 20:28.770
Kevin! Don't toss that last hay bale!

20:31.565 --> 20:33.066
I'm coming!

20:34.234 --> 20:37.321
I'll catch you!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.784
Are you okay, Mama Bird?

20:48.332 --> 20:49.458
Otis?

20:52.294 --> 20:54.505
I didn't know they were back there.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.552
Big K is glad you saved the day, Otis.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.556
Come on.

21:04.640 --> 21:08.268
Let's go back to the barn. Very carefully.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.941
Now, where should we put this nest?

21:23.534 --> 21:26.245
There you go.
You'll be safe here, Mama Bird.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.582
The eggs are hatching!

21:32.960 --> 21:34.086
I see a beak!

21:34.169 --> 21:36.964
What? I can't miss this!

21:40.425 --> 21:43.220
Come on, little birdie. You can do it!

21:43.303 --> 21:44.555
Go, birdie, go!

21:44.638 --> 21:46.723
-Hatch.
-Almost there.

21:49.184 --> 21:51.061
So cute.

21:55.816 --> 21:57.860
The second egg is hatching!

21:59.987 --> 22:01.488
And the last one!

22:07.578 --> 22:10.205
Baby birds, baby birds

22:10.289 --> 22:13.208
Nice to meet you, baby birds

22:17.671 --> 22:19.506
Happy to help, Mama Bird.

22:22.926 --> 22:25.012
Way to be a hearty helper, Otis.

22:25.637 --> 22:28.223
On this farm, we're all hearty helpers.

22:30.267 --> 22:31.810
-You are the cutest!
-Awesome!

22:31.894 --> 22:34.855
-Wait till you see the farm!
-Look at those little beaks.

22:34.938 --> 22:36.940
-Cock-a-doodle-whoo-hoo!
-Yeah!
