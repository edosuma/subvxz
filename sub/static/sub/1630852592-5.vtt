How long...
have you been posting your mail...

01:35.680 --> 01:37.120
in a dog waste bin?

01:38.000 --> 01:39.280
About a year now, I'd say.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.080
Right. I mean, it says "dog waste" on it.

01:42.480 --> 01:43.960
Yeah, but my eyes are shot to shit.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.560
-Right.
-[man] I'm blind as a bat.

01:45.640 --> 01:48.440
These aren't mine. I lost mine.
I found these on a bus.

01:48.800 --> 01:49.760
-They're no good.
-Right.

01:49.840 --> 01:51.960
Gotta be near the house,
need a piss every ten minutes.

01:52.040 --> 01:53.680
I got a prostate like a coconut.

01:54.480 --> 01:57.560
This is the least of my worries,
to be honest with you, with all that.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.120
Anyway, where was I?

02:00.520 --> 02:03.320
So... Right, my sister, yeah?
She lives in Australia.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.840
I'm thinking,
"Why's she ignoring me?"

02:04.920 --> 02:06.880
-You were writing to her, and she wasn't--
-Yeah.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.840
-But you were putting them in there?
-Well, yeah. I'm not on email, see.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.800
I keep getting threatening letters
from the gas and the electricity.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.360
I said, "Hey, I've paid,"
I said, "and I'll prove it to you."

02:15.440 --> 02:16.800
So, I sent them another letter.

02:16.880 --> 02:19.760
And I put it in here, with all my letters,
in all that shit!

02:20.080 --> 02:22.680
What did you think the smell was?
Wasn't that a clue?

02:23.080 --> 02:25.080
-I thought that was me.
-You thought it was you?

02:25.160 --> 02:27.160
There's a similar smell in the house,
to be honest.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.640
-I've got nobody to be hygienic for.
-[Tony] No?

02:29.720 --> 02:32.160
Nah. No point, is there?
No one to wash for.

02:33.440 --> 02:35.600
-Yourself, maybe?
-No, no point, is there?

02:36.200 --> 02:39.840
No point to anything, is there, really?
I don't know where they took the letters.

02:39.920 --> 02:42.400
Where do they take dog shit?
They probably bury it, do they?

02:42.520 --> 02:44.520
That's where we're all gonna end up,
though, innit?

02:44.960 --> 02:49.400
You know, we're all just future shit,
you know? I've got no self-esteem, I have.

02:49.480 --> 02:51.160
No.

02:51.600 --> 02:53.600
That's why I never had a relationship.

02:53.680 --> 02:55.360
You've never had a relationship?

02:56.160 --> 02:57.800
'Cause I knew that if I did...

02:58.640 --> 03:01.440
that she's going to find somebody,
see, better than me.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.600
Better than me, at that.
And then leave me, wouldn't she? Eh?

03:10.480 --> 03:13.400
Right, come on, then. What's your angle
on this? What's it gonna be?

03:13.480 --> 03:18.320
I don't think there is an angle.
You've been posting your letters in a...

03:19.280 --> 03:23.040
a box of shit for a year.
That is pretty much it.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.480
There's a moral to the story,
though, ain't there? Gotta be.

03:25.560 --> 03:28.680
You know, be careful.
Careful now where you post your letters.

03:30.320 --> 03:31.640
-Take a picture.
-Yeah.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.400
-Hurry up. I need a piss.
-[Lenny] All right.

03:35.480 --> 03:36.760
-Get on with it.
-[shutter clicks]

03:36.840 --> 03:38.320
-Hang on. Got it?
-Great.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.240
[man] All right.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.080
-There he goes.
-Yep.

03:43.960 --> 03:45.520
-[Tony] That's depressing.
-[Lenny] Yeah.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.000
[Tony] Imagine never having a relationship
in case it ends.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.320
A relationship <i>is </i>life.

03:51.800 --> 03:52.720
Exactly.

03:55.480 --> 03:56.600
I've had a good life.

03:57.040 --> 04:00.360
-Well, it's still going!
-No, I know. I know.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.720
Look, he's pissing where he stands.
Like a dog.

04:07.240 --> 04:09.800
[Tony] That's the best he's felt all day,
that piss.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.400
Right, I'm off to see my dad.

04:14.200 --> 04:15.400
Right. I'm just gonna...

04:15.480 --> 04:16.760
-See you later.
-See ya.

04:19.800 --> 04:20.680
[shutter clicks]

04:22.120 --> 04:24.040
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

04:24.560 --> 04:26.360
-[nurse] You all right?
-Yeah. Um...

04:27.000 --> 04:28.520
Is he OK? He seems a bit...

04:29.360 --> 04:31.880
-Yeah. Well, he's been a bit up and down.
-[Tony grunts]

04:31.960 --> 04:33.600
Perky this morning, though, eh?

04:33.960 --> 04:35.040
Called Simon a cunt.

04:36.040 --> 04:36.880
Did he?

04:36.960 --> 04:39.160
[chuckles]
Yeah, I thought you'd like that.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.280
That's my boy!

04:43.120 --> 04:45.080
Anyway, I'd better get on.
I've got to--

04:45.160 --> 04:48.120
Um, I'm going to that revue thing tonight,

04:48.200 --> 04:49.360
-if you wanna...
-Oh!

04:49.440 --> 04:51.480
-I'm working, sorry.
-Right. Yeah.

04:51.560 --> 04:52.760
Well, it's no big deal.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.240
If you want to chat,
give me a call... or text.

04:56.800 --> 04:58.840
-[chuckles] OK.
-All right.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
See you later.

05:06.400 --> 05:07.880
Do you want to lie down, Dad?

05:10.440 --> 05:12.360
-Yeah.
-Yeah? Come on, then.

05:13.640 --> 05:15.040
[Tony's dad exhales heavily]

05:15.120 --> 05:16.280
-Come on.
-Yeah.

05:16.840 --> 05:18.200
[Tony's dad groans lightly]

05:19.520 --> 05:22.920
And I know that nothing's...
you know, certain or anything, but...

05:23.000 --> 05:25.560
Jill's gonna come with me
to the revue.

05:25.640 --> 05:28.400
-What revue?
-It's a local theater thing.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.120
Oh, yeah?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.480
Plenty of thespussy knocking about, then?

05:33.560 --> 05:34.640
No, I don't think so.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.200
It's... more like...

05:37.120 --> 05:39.680
um, local people doing some songs, and...

05:39.760 --> 05:42.000
I mean, there's one woman
who does feminist poetry.

05:42.080 --> 05:43.320
[scoffs] Feminists!

05:43.400 --> 05:47.280
Lesbians make me laugh, you know.
They use dildos and stuff, don't they?

05:47.760 --> 05:48.680
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

05:48.760 --> 05:52.440
Sorry, do you like cock or don't you?
You're confusing me here, darling.

05:52.520 --> 05:54.840
Make your fucking mind up.
D'you know what I mean?

05:57.040 --> 05:58.040
Yeah!

05:58.120 --> 05:59.520
-Do you?
-Yeah. No, it's...

06:00.040 --> 06:01.560
er... a good point.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.440
I actually had to...
let down that chick at work.

06:05.960 --> 06:09.760
She was coming on a bit strong.
I was like... "Nah.

06:11.040 --> 06:12.360
Back... Back off, baby."

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
-Wise.
-Yeah.

06:13.520 --> 06:16.960
-Don't shit on your own doorstep, brother.
-That's what I thought, yeah.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.520
Anyway, she's in the bank
if you need a nosh.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.640
[chuckles lightly] OK.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.600
-Fancy seeing you here.
-[Anne laughs] 

06:29.000 --> 06:31.520
-You OK?
-Yeah.

06:32.000 --> 06:34.960
Still covering awful local stories
that no one cares about,

06:35.520 --> 06:36.840
upsetting people I like,

06:37.280 --> 06:38.440
trying to keep my job,

06:39.040 --> 06:40.440
and not kill anyone. You?

06:40.960 --> 06:42.800
[laughs heartily]

06:44.120 --> 06:45.080
Ah...

06:45.680 --> 06:48.680
It's nice to hear you moan
about work, and...

06:49.320 --> 06:51.720
relationships, just like a normal person.

06:53.520 --> 06:56.360
-Yeah, I suppose this is progress.
-Mm.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.600
I should pay you for these chats.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.440
All that money I waste on the shrink,
this is much better.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.120
Your friendship means more to me
than money.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.160
Are you lonely?

07:15.040 --> 07:16.440
I only miss one person.

07:18.160 --> 07:20.640
Yep. Me too.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.160
-What?
-Um...

07:28.720 --> 07:30.880
Do you want to go to the revue tonight?

07:34.000 --> 07:36.480
I don't think so.
I don't get out much these days.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.240
It's hardly out. It's less out than this!

07:39.760 --> 07:42.560
And it's still just sitting down
looking at something.

07:42.960 --> 07:43.960
It'll be funny.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.080
Come on.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.320
OK.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.840
-Yeah?
-I'll pop in.

07:52.480 --> 07:53.320
Brilliant.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.320
[Paul] I'd very much like to thank you all
for letting me share your day.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.880
Hi. Um... Would you like to go
to the revue thing tonight?

08:02.440 --> 08:03.440
What is it?

08:03.520 --> 08:05.000
Awful, probably.

08:05.080 --> 08:07.680
But some of us are going down,
and someone I... um...

08:07.760 --> 08:09.920
Just it might be fun.
I thought you might...

08:10.480 --> 08:11.760
Uh, sure, yeah. Why not?

08:12.200 --> 08:14.960
Great. It's at the community hall
at 7:30. 

08:15.360 --> 08:18.080
But we'd get there early enough
for a drink if you want, or just...

08:18.160 --> 08:20.640
Is there a dress code?
Should I wear a suit or...?

08:20.720 --> 08:22.920
No. It's really not a posh do. [chuckles]

08:23.000 --> 08:25.200
What would you wear
to visit a mental home?

08:25.280 --> 08:27.240
But... you know, look nice.

08:28.080 --> 08:29.120
-So--
-Look nice?

08:29.200 --> 08:31.280
I mean... groomed, whatever.

08:31.360 --> 08:32.200
Oh.

08:32.920 --> 08:33.800
OK.

08:33.880 --> 08:35.600
-Brilliant.
-Well, I'll see you later.

08:36.800 --> 08:37.640
Good.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.320
-Look.
-What are you doing?

08:53.400 --> 08:56.600
-[James] Just limbering up.
-[Valerie] This is an office.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.120
-[June] Hiya.
-Hi.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.800
-What you doing?
-Just limbering up.

09:03.880 --> 09:06.120
Come on, you.
Let's get you down that hall.

09:07.280 --> 09:08.840
If your dad could see you now.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.680
What happened? Is he dead?

09:11.760 --> 09:15.960
No, he walked out on us.
James did his head in, didn't ya?

09:16.040 --> 09:18.120
-[James] I was a bit of a handful.
-[June] Mm.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.560
Thought there was something wrong
with him at first.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.200
He even had to see the school doctor.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.600
-Thought I was mad [chuckles].
-Or backward.

09:24.680 --> 09:27.440
[James] Yeah, I was terrible at everything
at school.

09:27.520 --> 09:30.440
I was more interested in, like,
entertaining people, you know?

09:30.840 --> 09:34.240
-And there wasn't anything wrong with you?
-Oh, no. Not, like, mental or anything.

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
Overweight and... hyperactive, but--

09:36.400 --> 09:37.600
Just really annoying.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.440
Mm. His dad said, "It's either him or me.

09:40.520 --> 09:42.640
One of us has got to go
for this to work."

09:42.720 --> 09:43.760
And you chose him?

09:43.840 --> 09:46.480
Oh, no. I chose his dad at first.
But when we asked James to leave,

09:46.560 --> 09:48.760
he broke down,
threatened to kill himself, didn't ya?

09:49.120 --> 09:49.960
Yeah.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.680
Found someone better now, anyway.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.320
[June giggles]

09:59.880 --> 10:01.600
Right, let's get going.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.400
Yeah. Lots to do. I'm starving as well.

10:04.480 --> 10:06.640
[June] No, don't be eating too much.
You always do that:

10:06.720 --> 10:09.240
get excited, all churned up,
and then you've got to dance around--

10:09.320 --> 10:12.040
If you're getting food, um,
I'll... I'll come with you.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.280
[sniggers]

10:14.400 --> 10:15.240
See ya.

10:15.600 --> 10:16.440
[Lenny] Wait!

10:17.840 --> 10:20.360
-Good.
-[Kath] I'd better get off an' all.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.160
To, uh... get ready for tonight.

10:26.720 --> 10:27.880
Got a date.

10:32.360 --> 10:33.200
So...

10:34.840 --> 10:36.000
-See ya later.
-Bye.

10:37.360 --> 10:38.360
[Sandy] Bye.

10:45.080 --> 10:46.600
Looking forward to tonight?

10:48.360 --> 10:49.520
It's work, isn't it?

10:50.680 --> 10:51.760
[Tony] Yeah, but...

10:53.040 --> 10:54.040
might be fun.

10:54.560 --> 10:55.760
[chuckles sadly] Yeah.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.560
We laugh at James
for living with his mum,

10:59.640 --> 11:02.440
but he's ten years younger than me,
I live with my mum.

11:03.440 --> 11:04.600
Everyone's got a date.

11:05.680 --> 11:06.680
I haven't.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.960
-Sorry.
-No, I mean...

11:10.680 --> 11:13.320
you're not the only one.
It's no big deal.

11:14.560 --> 11:15.600
There's no rush.

11:16.160 --> 11:17.480
Don't wallow. It's...

11:18.960 --> 11:20.200
You get addicted to it.

11:22.480 --> 11:23.640
I am, I think.

11:24.480 --> 11:25.480
Grief, I mean.

11:26.880 --> 11:30.320

Do you know what I mean? I just...

11:31.840 --> 11:34.960
When summat goes well or I see
a glimpse of hope, I get confused.

11:35.720 --> 11:39.360
And then when it all turns to shit,
I go, "Oh, there it is.

11:40.880 --> 11:43.440
Now we can get drunk and wait for death."
[chuckles]

11:45.320 --> 11:46.840

11:54.040 --> 11:56.440
I wish I'd danced with Lisa
every time she asked.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.320
It was 'cause I was embarrassed sometimes
or lazy.

12:00.680 --> 12:02.000
Oh, what I'd give for...

12:02.800 --> 12:04.440
just five minutes with her now.

12:05.960 --> 12:07.920
Just holding her. Just moving around.

-You gonna go again?

12:25.480 --> 12:27.800
Well, I've hardly had any of this,
but I'd normally--

12:27.880 --> 12:30.000
Hiya. My date.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.320

12:36.760 --> 12:39.480
-Secondhand.
-Still a Rolls Royce. Very successful.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.880
Yeah, I made a lot of money in scrap.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.040

I couldn't afford that.

13:06.680 --> 13:08.800
-Not in a million years.
-No.

I've shoved my cock up my arse.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.720
-So, how does that work?
-Ooh! Now he's interested!

13:16.440 --> 13:18.840
Trade secrets, innit?
Nah, you're a mate.

13:18.920 --> 13:21.000
Basically, I cram it up there flaccid...

13:21.080 --> 13:22.880
and then I wait for it to get hard.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.800
It's the only way it can be done,
if I'm honest.

13:25.880 --> 13:27.400
I think a bit too honest.
