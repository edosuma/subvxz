00:04.505 --> 00:06.038
This is so exciting,

00:06.039 --> 00:07.639
our first meeting with a comedy manager.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.007
I love going out to breakfast

00:09.008 --> 00:10.108
because no one ever judges you

00:10.109 --> 00:11.211
for not getting a salad.

00:11.212 --> 00:12.512
I'll judge you.

00:12.513 --> 00:14.646
You two are so bloody funny together.

00:14.647 --> 00:16.014
You know, Richard, in Australia,

00:16.015 --> 00:17.082
are the kangaroos

00:17.083 --> 00:18.350
as prevalent as squirrels here?

00:18.351 --> 00:19.119
I could beat up a kangaroo.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.186
You could not!

00:20.187 --> 00:21.319
- Yes I could.
- You could not.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.154
I have no reason to but I could.

00:23.155 --> 00:24.356
Are you looking for representation?

00:24.357 --> 00:25.425
Oh my god, are you kidding?

00:25.426 --> 00:27.126
- Always, yes!
- Yeah.

00:27.127 --> 00:28.227
That was easy.

00:28.228 --> 00:29.427
Yes, we have a manager now.

00:29.428 --> 00:30.495
All right, slow down.

00:30.496 --> 00:31.396
Let's start this gradually.

00:31.397 --> 00:32.531
We'll try a few things

00:32.531 --> 00:33.798
and build a relationship.

00:33.799 --> 00:34.735
I'd like to have a relationship

00:34.736 --> 00:36.269
with a fresh kangaroo.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.302
I'll bop them right in the nose,

00:37.303 --> 00:38.603
give them the old paintbrush.

00:38.604 --> 00:40.272
You're obsessed with kangaroos.

00:40.273 --> 00:41.673
Are you interested in writing jobs?

00:41.674 --> 00:43.275
- Oh my God, yes. Of course.
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:43.276 --> 00:44.543
I'd like any job where I'm considered

00:44.544 --> 00:46.046
the person with the most social skills.

00:46.047 --> 00:49.081
And I always hated pants with zippers.

00:49.082 --> 00:51.049
Even Later with Chris Hardwick is looking.

00:51.050 --> 00:53.518
After Jimmy Fallon, Seth
Meyers, Carson Daly,

00:53.519 --> 00:54.553
it's a live show that recaps

00:54.554 --> 00:56.054
the entire late night block.

00:56.055 --> 00:57.355
Exactly what we needed.

00:57.356 --> 00:59.124
- I've been saying that!
- Yeah, yeah, finally!

00:59.125 --> 01:00.759
So in the packet, what
do we have to write?

01:00.760 --> 01:01.660
Monologue jokes,

01:01.661 --> 01:02.661
Twitter hashtag games.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.162
- Great.
- Absolutely.

01:04.163 --> 01:05.465
We will kill it, we will crush it.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.733
It's due tomorrow morning.

01:07.734 --> 01:10.469
I am so ready to write television

01:10.470 --> 01:12.537
instead of just watching
it and recapping it.

01:12.538 --> 01:14.306
This is huge, Billy, do you realize

01:14.307 --> 01:15.540
how many people started out

01:15.541 --> 01:16.675
as late night television writers?

01:16.676 --> 01:18.209
Mel Brooks, Woody Allen.

01:18.210 --> 01:19.778
I know, I can't wait to
marry my own daughter

01:19.779 --> 01:22.414
and start writing terrible
movie scripts ten years ago.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.583
I'm so proud of Woody
Allen, he paid so many dues

01:24.584 --> 01:26.051
and he finally got what he always wanted.

01:26.052 --> 01:27.554
- An Amazon series.
- An Amazon series.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.559
Hello Billy, Noodles.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.126
Why are you surrounded with the vestiges

01:35.127 --> 01:36.294
of print journalism?

01:36.295 --> 01:37.429
We have an opportunity

01:37.430 --> 01:38.730
to be television writers.

01:38.731 --> 01:40.599
Yes, and we are looking at newspapers

01:40.600 --> 01:41.466
because we have to write jokes

01:41.467 --> 01:42.703
about current events.

01:42.704 --> 01:45.205
Which newspapers are bursting with.

01:47.074 --> 01:48.441
Oh, Ebola's back!

01:48.442 --> 01:49.642
Uh oh!

01:49.643 --> 01:51.142
We could do something like, uh,

01:51.143 --> 01:52.512
Angelina Jolie is a director,

01:52.513 --> 01:54.413
and now Ebola's back?

01:54.414 --> 01:55.748
- Uh oh!
- Uh oh!

01:55.749 --> 01:57.248
- Right?
- But we need premise, like--

01:57.249 --> 01:58.385
You know how they talk on talk shows,

01:58.386 --> 02:00.353
like, uh, in the news today.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.353
You guys hear about this?

02:01.354 --> 02:02.656
Here's a funny story, or...

02:02.657 --> 02:05.658
Joe Biden had dinner in New York City.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.425
Yeah, Joe Biden had
dinner in New York City.

02:07.426 --> 02:08.660
Joe Biden had dinner in New York City.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.161
Joe Biden dinner in New York City.

02:10.162 --> 02:12.063
Joe Biden tonight had
dinner in New York City.

02:12.064 --> 02:14.366
What a-- what a--
what a clod, right?

02:14.367 --> 02:15.502
That's our take on him.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.103
Yeah.

02:17.104 --> 02:19.039
We could write a joke about the Taliban.

02:19.040 --> 02:20.172
Yes.

02:20.173 --> 02:22.041
Like, the Taliban's awful,

02:22.042 --> 02:24.144
and Angelina Jolie is directing now?

02:24.145 --> 02:25.711
- Uh oh!
- Uh oh!

02:25.712 --> 02:28.179
Sounds like you two are
off to a great start.

02:28.180 --> 02:30.250
Text me if you don't
want paella for dinner.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.351
Consider yourself texted.

02:35.455 --> 02:36.156
Julie, you okay?

02:36.157 --> 02:37.289
Yeah, why?

02:37.290 --> 02:38.423
Because Arthur was whistling

02:38.424 --> 02:39.691
and you didn't say anything.

02:39.692 --> 02:41.192
It was like you didn't mind.

02:41.193 --> 02:42.596
You know, I have oddly been more serene

02:42.597 --> 02:45.731
these past few days, and nauseous.

02:45.732 --> 02:48.267
And late for my period, oh my God!

02:48.268 --> 02:50.301
- What if I'm pregnant?
- You're not pregnant.

02:50.302 --> 02:51.503
- There's no way I'm pregnant.
- No.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.071
But then there's that TV show

02:53.072 --> 02:54.439
of women that went to the bathroom one day

02:54.440 --> 02:55.674
and, surprise, you don't have to poop,

02:55.675 --> 02:57.008
you're a human mother.

02:57.009 --> 02:58.612
I don't watch that show.

02:58.613 --> 02:59.979
Oh my god.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.181
What if I'm pregnant?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.085
None of these pregnancy tests
are gonna be accurate.

03:07.086 --> 03:08.188
- Why not?
- I'm on this

03:08.189 --> 03:10.389
illegal Canadian HCG hormone

03:10.390 --> 03:12.490
I ordered from a spam
email to lose weight.

03:12.491 --> 03:13.792
Well, that sounds perfectly safe.

03:13.793 --> 03:15.295
Yeah, I know, but what's the alternative,

03:15.296 --> 03:16.796
portion control?

03:16.797 --> 03:18.231
Now, any of these tests I take

03:18.232 --> 03:21.167
is gonna give me a false negative.

03:21.168 --> 03:23.069
I'm gonna call my doctor.

03:23.070 --> 03:26.038
Oh, lube has its own aisle here, fancy.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.239
My doctor can't see me until Friday,

03:28.240 --> 03:29.407
so I decided to stock up

03:29.408 --> 03:31.342
on Hope tampons in the meantime.

03:31.343 --> 03:33.445
I'm sure your body will get the hint.

03:33.446 --> 03:35.380
You know, as impressed
as I was with Richard,

03:35.381 --> 03:37.015
I just don't know if he's
the right match for us.

03:37.016 --> 03:38.450
There's something about him.

03:38.451 --> 03:40.685
I can't tell if he's
sleazy or just Australian.

03:40.686 --> 03:41.653
So, if he's the wrong manager,

03:41.654 --> 03:42.721
we can always leave.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.189
I mean, nothing is permanent.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.024
Except, you know, parenthood.

03:46.025 --> 03:48.059
Well, not the show
Parenthood, that's over.

03:48.060 --> 03:49.096
Every lesbian I'm friends with on Facebook

03:49.097 --> 03:50.362
loved that show.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.663
I know, it was so important to them

03:51.664 --> 03:53.431
to let all their friends
know when they cried.

03:53.432 --> 03:54.466
Yeah, how did lesbians let us know

03:54.467 --> 03:56.069
they were crying before Facebook?

03:56.070 --> 03:57.236
Smoke signals.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.139
Oh my God.

04:00.140 --> 04:02.476
The Huffington Post: Print Edition?

04:02.477 --> 04:04.210
Are you kidding me?

04:04.211 --> 04:05.444
This is a joke?

04:05.445 --> 04:07.279
No, this is real.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.413
Everything you liked about
the Huffington Post

04:08.414 --> 04:09.547
without any of the convenience.

04:09.548 --> 04:11.249
And who says print is dead?

04:11.250 --> 04:13.284
Somebody at a party I would
never want to talk to.

04:13.285 --> 04:16.353
Look at this, how do they
afford all of this ink?

04:16.355 --> 04:17.689
Every person in the known universe

04:17.690 --> 04:19.224
is a columnist in here.

04:19.225 --> 04:20.524
Well, to be fair, could we really

04:20.526 --> 04:21.993
have gone another day without reading

04:21.994 --> 04:23.762
Phoebe Tutnauer's haunting personal essay

04:23.763 --> 04:25.699
about her bad experience with Airbnb?

04:25.700 --> 04:27.032
I must buy this!

04:31.104 --> 04:33.138
I'm glad we got candy. It helps me think.

04:33.139 --> 04:35.573
Mm-hm, me too. It's good for
our brains; It's like fish.

04:35.574 --> 04:37.041
Do you ever read about those rich women

04:37.042 --> 04:38.276
whose dermatologists tell them to eat

04:38.277 --> 04:40.078
so much salmon that they joke,

04:40.079 --> 04:42.280
"Maybe I'm one day gonna become a salmon!"

04:42.281 --> 04:43.782
Yeah, like someone who's like,

04:43.783 --> 04:45.283
"Oh, if I ate another a blueberry,

04:45.284 --> 04:47.120
I think I'm gonna become a blueberry."

04:47.121 --> 04:50.055
It's like, no, you're not.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.658
I think it's from Willy Wonka.

04:51.659 --> 04:52.726
Mm.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.463
We should get something on the page.

04:56.464 --> 04:57.196
Yeah.

04:57.197 --> 04:58.196
We're supposed to come up

04:58.197 --> 04:59.364
with Twitter hashtag games.

04:59.365 --> 05:00.598
Why don't we go on Twitter,

05:00.599 --> 05:02.100
look at some actual hashtag games?

05:02.101 --> 05:02.969
Like research.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.171
Mm-hm.

05:06.000 --> 05:12.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:15.382 --> 05:16.516
This isn't working.

05:16.517 --> 05:17.349
I know.

05:17.350 --> 05:19.051
You know why?

05:19.052 --> 05:20.718
This isn't a proper work environment.

05:20.719 --> 05:22.620
I was just thinking that,
I didn't want to say it.

05:22.621 --> 05:24.491
We need to make it more like
a comedy writer's room.

05:24.492 --> 05:27.393
You know what comedy writer's rooms have?

05:27.394 --> 05:28.428
Ping pong tables.

05:28.429 --> 05:29.728
Yes. Yes!

05:29.729 --> 05:33.132
It'll free up our minds for jokes

05:33.133 --> 05:35.266
because their hands are moving around!

05:35.267 --> 05:36.367
- In motion.
- We should get one.

05:36.368 --> 05:37.604
- Let's go get it.
- At a...

05:37.605 --> 05:39.705
Um... a sporting goods store?

05:39.706 --> 05:40.972
Yep, we'll write on the train.

05:40.973 --> 05:41.739
Yep, I'll bring my laptop.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.642
I'll bring mine too.

05:46.613 --> 05:48.646
I'm glad we didn't write on the train.

05:48.647 --> 05:50.715
Yeah, you know, I think
if you start to obsess

05:50.716 --> 05:52.283
too much about the actual writing,

05:52.284 --> 05:53.585
you miss the opportunity to be

05:53.586 --> 05:55.486
inspired by changing your environment.

05:55.487 --> 05:56.688
Yeah, speaking of which,

05:56.689 --> 05:58.089
let's get the ping pong table

05:58.090 --> 05:59.557
and get the hell out of here.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.092
I know, I'm getting flashbacks

06:01.093 --> 06:03.094
to all those jocks in my high school.

06:03.095 --> 06:06.266
Oh my God, you know what my
worst nightmare would be?

06:06.267 --> 06:07.700
What if I am pregnant

06:07.701 --> 06:08.768
and I end up having a son,

06:08.769 --> 06:10.169
and he's athletic

06:10.170 --> 06:12.271
and well adjusted and popular.

06:12.272 --> 06:14.641
And, oh my God, what if he's not gay?

06:14.642 --> 06:16.709
Julie, stop being crazy.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.276
I promise you, if you have a son,

06:18.277 --> 06:20.245
he will be as gay as Jason Gould.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.214
Thank you, but still,

06:21.215 --> 06:22.581
could you imagine?

06:22.582 --> 06:24.517
What if he tried to high five me one time?

06:24.518 --> 06:25.117
Ugh.

06:25.118 --> 06:26.318
I know.

06:26.319 --> 06:27.385
So which is the black side

06:27.386 --> 06:28.253
and which is the red side?

06:28.254 --> 06:29.153
Are they different

06:29.154 --> 06:31.356
or is it the same kind of rubber?

06:31.357 --> 06:32.690
I didn't know these were wood.

06:32.691 --> 06:34.392
- Is it real wood?
- Hey folks, I'm Rita.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.526
Looking for a ping pong table?

06:35.527 --> 06:37.061
- Yeah, I think so.
- Possibly.

06:37.062 --> 06:38.563
Well, the thing I like about this one

06:38.564 --> 06:40.765
is this integrated ball
storage apron right here.

06:40.766 --> 06:42.002
It's right at the knee length.

06:42.003 --> 06:42.701
It's nice.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.169
Holds a lot of balls.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.471
Oh my God, this is really expensive.

06:46.472 --> 06:49.207
Well, don't make any
decisions you can't back up.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.109
You know, I always like
to tell my customers

06:51.110 --> 06:52.176
to sleep on it when it comes

06:52.177 --> 06:53.745
to making big purchases.

06:53.746 --> 06:55.446
Doesn't make me the best
salesgirl on the floor,

06:55.447 --> 06:57.183
but, at least I have a good conscience.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.451
Well, we all make choices.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.120
Choices, huh.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.987
Hey, you want to hear a funny story?

07:02.988 --> 07:04.555
I used to be an Olympic gymnast.

07:04.556 --> 07:05.623
That is... funny.

07:05.624 --> 07:07.158
Yeah, I even got an offer

07:07.159 --> 07:08.760
to be on the cover of a box of Wheaties,

07:08.761 --> 07:10.428
but then a much trashier cereal

07:10.429 --> 07:11.765
approached me for twice the money

07:11.766 --> 07:13.299
and I couldn't say no.

07:13.300 --> 07:14.334
After my photo was published

07:14.335 --> 07:16.368
on box after box of Slappies,

07:16.369 --> 07:18.003
my career was over.

07:18.004 --> 07:19.337
What the hell are Slappies?

07:19.338 --> 07:20.538
Oh, they're off the market now.

07:20.539 --> 07:21.639
They were kind of like Wheaties,

07:21.640 --> 07:23.043
but they glowed in the dark.

07:23.044 --> 07:25.210
Turns out the 27,000%

07:25.211 --> 07:27.312
of a daily recommended
allowance of mercury

07:27.313 --> 07:28.713
is "too much of a good thing."

07:28.714 --> 07:29.516
Are you serious?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.749
That's horrible!

07:30.750 --> 07:32.786
Yeah... sure wish I turned them down

07:32.787 --> 07:34.386
when I had the chance.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.755
Anyhoozle, how about this pivoting

07:36.756 --> 07:39.325
72 inch cotton blend net.

07:39.326 --> 07:40.627
Look at that, you can catch blue crabs

07:40.628 --> 07:42.695
in something like that, right?

07:42.696 --> 07:44.362
- You guys go crabbing?
- Yeah...

07:44.363 --> 07:45.663
We're never gonna play ping pong.

07:45.664 --> 07:47.165
No, and now that I see it in person,

07:47.166 --> 07:48.266
I don't think it's as inspirational

07:48.267 --> 07:49.467
as I thought it would be.

07:49.468 --> 07:50.435
We're not, like, sportsmen.

07:50.436 --> 07:51.536
Now that we're here,

07:51.537 --> 07:53.371
it just, it's--
it's not a good idea.

07:53.372 --> 07:56.209
Okay, well what the fuck am
I doing here then, right?

07:56.210 --> 07:57.376
Oh, wow...

07:57.377 --> 07:58.477
Clarence!

07:58.478 --> 08:01.213
Okay, back to the packet.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.082
I have an idea.

08:03.083 --> 08:05.249
What if we went to the Paley Center,

08:05.250 --> 08:06.651
and we watched old episodes

08:06.652 --> 08:08.319
of late night talk shows for inspiration.

08:08.320 --> 08:10.121
Yes! I've always wanted to do that.

08:10.122 --> 08:11.222
You can go and you can watch,

08:11.223 --> 08:13.758
like, Steve Alan and Jack
Paar, and all of it.

08:13.759 --> 08:15.193
Yes, even if we just watch a couple

08:15.194 --> 08:16.429
of episodes of Johnny Carson,

08:16.430 --> 08:17.796
it will inspire us.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.597
Totally. What was that thing Johnny Carson

08:19.598 --> 08:21.334
used to do, oh no, punch women.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.634
Yes.

08:22.635 --> 08:24.304
I am so glad we left the Paley Center

08:24.305 --> 08:25.537
to get mani-pedis.

08:25.538 --> 08:27.005
Me too, how are we supposed to sit

08:27.006 --> 08:28.606
through a single episode
of any of that shit?

08:28.607 --> 08:30.308
I know, right, it's so boring.

08:30.309 --> 08:32.610
I mean, Ernie Kovacs, suck my dick.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.214
That was a different time.

08:34.215 --> 08:35.114
Were they?

08:35.115 --> 08:36.547
I mean, it's 2015, and still,

08:36.548 --> 08:37.615
every single talk show host

08:37.616 --> 08:39.082
on network late night TV

08:39.083 --> 08:40.320
is a straight white man.

08:40.321 --> 08:42.020
Hm, I don't know.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.457
Colbert's too smart not to at least be bi.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.293
See, girls that age,

08:48.294 --> 08:49.794
you just sneeze on them
and they get pregnant.

08:49.795 --> 08:51.262
But what erotic foreplay?

08:51.263 --> 08:52.597
Seriously though, I'm 35,

08:52.598 --> 08:54.665
what if this is my last
chance to get pregnant?

08:54.666 --> 08:55.668
Do you want to be pregnant?

08:55.669 --> 08:56.735
No!

08:56.736 --> 08:57.703
Oh, thank God.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.003
But what if I do one day,

08:59.004 --> 09:00.304
and when the time is
right I'm not able to?

09:00.305 --> 09:01.305
Well, what if you do one day

09:01.306 --> 09:02.607
and then you become one of those people

09:02.608 --> 09:04.175
that only talks about
their baby all the time,

09:04.176 --> 09:06.477
and then I have to find a new friend?

09:06.478 --> 09:07.747
God, look at the masthead on this thing.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.381
It's huge!

09:09.382 --> 09:11.249
Oh good, Bill Maher has something to say.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.051
How could he still call them "New Rules"?

09:13.052 --> 09:15.286
He's been on the air since
his hair was still mauve.

09:15.287 --> 09:17.490
I don't know, we need fresh
voices on television.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.158
I know, ours!

09:19.159 --> 09:20.224
I just want to dive in

09:20.225 --> 09:21.294
and write, write, write!

09:21.295 --> 09:22.461
Me too!

09:22.462 --> 09:23.361
You know what would be fun?

09:23.362 --> 09:24.330
To go to a movie.

09:24.331 --> 09:25.397
A movie.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.697
So it's later than we thought,

09:26.698 --> 09:27.634
I'm still glad we saw that.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.068
Me too.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.168
The only annoying thing is how many

09:30.169 --> 09:31.569
of our friends were in it.

09:31.570 --> 09:33.704
Anything at this point
that's Apatow-adjacent

09:33.705 --> 09:36.042
we just have to accept
is gonna star everyone

09:36.043 --> 09:38.377
we went into improv class with.

09:38.378 --> 09:40.011
- Oh no.
- What's wrong?

09:40.012 --> 09:41.179
Is the baby kicking?

09:41.180 --> 09:42.313
I don't have my laptop.

09:42.314 --> 09:44.017
But our sex tape is in the cloud!

09:44.018 --> 09:45.451
Ah!

09:45.452 --> 09:46.486
Seriously, though, I don't have my laptop.

09:53.159 --> 09:55.495
Sorry, guys, no laptop
in the lost and found.

09:55.496 --> 09:56.762
Really? I-- I--

09:56.763 --> 09:58.996
Could just ask Rita if it was near

09:58.997 --> 09:59.997
the ping pong table?

09:59.998 --> 10:01.132
I-- I know it has to be there.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.533
Well, Rita's shift ended, uh...

10:02.534 --> 10:04.402
maybe she took the laptop home.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.638
My friend has a lot of
classified information

10:05.639 --> 10:07.206
on that computer.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.708
She's a very important
businesswoman-- sir!

10:08.709 --> 10:10.109
She works for NASA.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.577
NASA?

10:11.578 --> 10:12.710
Those are the same sons of bitches

10:12.711 --> 10:14.212
who put me in this chair.

10:14.213 --> 10:15.279
I beg your pardon?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.647
There was this beautiful girl,

10:16.648 --> 10:18.382
you see, and it wasn't typical a girl

10:18.383 --> 10:19.684
that stunning would talk to me.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.688
Anyway, she asked me to accompany her

10:21.689 --> 10:23.622
to space camp.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.357
I should've said no.

10:25.358 --> 10:26.993
And what happened at space camp?

10:26.994 --> 10:29.094
I destroyed both my eardrums.

10:29.095 --> 10:30.394
Lost my equilibrium.

10:30.395 --> 10:31.764
What happened to the girl?

10:31.765 --> 10:33.198
Eh, she got away.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.135
Ground control to major bummer.

10:35.136 --> 10:37.302
Well, I'll go give Rita a call.

10:37.303 --> 10:38.604
Thank you so much.

10:38.605 --> 10:39.738
Yeah, thanks.

10:39.739 --> 10:42.174
Billy, I can't lose my laptop.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.708
Do you have a lot of naked
pictures of yourself on there?

10:43.709 --> 10:45.176
Of course, I'm more concerned

10:45.177 --> 10:46.711
about the emails badmouthing people.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.280
- Right.
- Amy Pascal has nothing on me.

10:49.281 --> 10:50.615
She's an angel compared to you.

10:50.616 --> 10:51.782
You're the same way.

10:51.783 --> 10:53.184
- I mean, come on.
- No, I know.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.418
If anyone published your emails,

10:54.419 --> 10:56.154
wouldn't you much rather
it was just, like,

10:56.155 --> 10:57.288
an unflattering photo of you naked?

10:57.289 --> 10:58.089
Are you kidding, I don't care

10:58.090 --> 10:58.591
what people say about my dick.

10:58.592 --> 11:00.192
Hey, NASA!

11:00.193 --> 11:01.360
Good news.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.493
Rita's got your laptop.

11:02.494 --> 11:03.694
- Are you serious?
- Oh yes!

11:03.695 --> 11:05.296
Oh my God, thank you so much!

11:05.297 --> 11:06.664
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.367
She said to meet her
near Astor Place at six.

11:09.368 --> 11:11.135
- Okay.
- She's got a voice lesson.

11:11.136 --> 11:13.206
Oh, wow, I wouldn't think
Rita could carry a tune.

11:13.207 --> 11:14.706
Shut your mouth!

11:14.707 --> 11:17.509
There's a lot of things Rita can do!

11:18.545 --> 11:19.511
This is good.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.545
We're meeting Rita at six

11:20.546 --> 11:21.714
so now we have three hours to write.

11:21.715 --> 11:22.648
Yes, exactly.

11:22.649 --> 11:23.648
All right, so...

11:23.649 --> 11:25.082
Should I type, or do you want to type?

11:25.083 --> 11:26.684
- We can switch off, we--
- We'll switch off.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.152
You wanna trade off,
like, every half hour?

11:28.153 --> 11:29.253
- Fifteen minutes.
- Okay.

11:29.254 --> 11:30.421
Why don't we trade off every ten minutes.

11:30.422 --> 11:31.389
- You should start.
- Okay.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.423
- You know.
- My keyboard's,

11:32.424 --> 11:33.793
like, disgusting at this point.

11:33.794 --> 11:37.663
Excuse me, um, I'm just
going to the restroom.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.363
If a guy comes in, about 5'9"

11:39.364 --> 11:40.598
wearing a purple scarf,

11:40.599 --> 11:41.332
will you tell him that

11:41.333 --> 11:42.402
I'll be right back, please?

11:42.403 --> 11:44.636
Yeah, sure.

11:44.637 --> 11:45.536
You're looking at my eyebrows, aren't you?

11:45.537 --> 11:47.104
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

11:47.105 --> 11:48.072
- You're looking at my eyebrows.
- No, I'm not.

11:48.073 --> 11:49.073
- No, no.
- No.

11:49.074 --> 11:49.974
They're obvious.

11:49.975 --> 11:50.743
- Yes, you are.
- I don't know.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.044
They look great.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.344
I got my hair done for this date,

11:53.345 --> 11:55.313
and the lady at the salon convinced me

11:55.314 --> 11:57.281
to darken them to make my eyes pop.

11:57.282 --> 11:58.416
First they turned black,

11:58.417 --> 11:59.586
so she put bleach on them,

11:59.587 --> 12:01.453
then... they turned yellow,

12:01.454 --> 12:03.488
so she put a gloss on them.

12:03.489 --> 12:05.490
Then they turned to mid gray.

12:05.491 --> 12:07.660
Next thing I knew, my eyebrows were gone.

12:07.661 --> 12:10.162
Oh my God.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.065
Be careful what you say yes to.

12:18.338 --> 12:19.670
Wow, I'm telling you,

12:19.671 --> 12:21.038
you don't know what it means to be alone

12:21.039 --> 12:22.208
until you're alone in New York.

12:22.209 --> 12:23.342
I know, right?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.709
All right, we have to do this.

12:24.710 --> 12:26.577
Hey, can I just borrow
your laptop real quick?

12:26.578 --> 12:28.548
I'm just gonna look up
abortion clinics on Yelp.

12:28.549 --> 12:31.283
Okay.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.719
Oh, this one got four and a half stars.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.119
Oh!

12:38.258 --> 12:40.358
She is almost a half hour late.

12:40.359 --> 12:41.728
What if she doesn't even have my laptop?

12:41.729 --> 12:45.197
What if this whole thing was just a con?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.101
Hi.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.535
You waiting for Rita?

12:50.536 --> 12:51.704
Yeah, so are you--

12:51.705 --> 12:53.605
I'm Kiki, her roommate.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.340
Rita's at urgent care.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.376
Oh, is she okay?

12:57.377 --> 12:58.544
Yeah, she'll be all right.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.345
Rita's Rita.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.281
Ah, here's your laptop.

13:02.282 --> 13:04.283
Oh, thank you so much.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.686
You have no idea what this means to me.

13:06.687 --> 13:08.553
No, I don't.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.789
Do you want to buy some coke?

13:12.091 --> 13:13.225
Mm.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.294
We just need index cards.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.595
Cowards.

13:24.370 --> 13:26.172
We bought a lot of stuff from Staples.

13:26.173 --> 13:28.140
We really did.

13:28.141 --> 13:31.510
And yet, we have not
written a single word.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.011
I know.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.047
We've wasted the day.

13:34.048 --> 13:35.580
We've wasted our day.

13:35.581 --> 13:37.048
We don't have anything on the page.

13:37.049 --> 13:37.782
What are we gonna do?

13:37.783 --> 13:38.683
What are we gonna do?

13:38.684 --> 13:39.550
I'm panicking!

13:39.551 --> 13:40.119
All right, don't panic!

13:40.120 --> 13:41.053
Motivate me!

13:41.054 --> 13:43.354
Okay, think of all the opportunities

13:43.355 --> 13:45.589
we didn't even get the chance to fail at.

13:45.590 --> 13:47.393
Right, this time if we don't get the job,

13:47.394 --> 13:48.660
it's our fault,

13:48.661 --> 13:51.596
and we can't blame the world.

13:51.597 --> 13:54.032
That's a nightmare.

13:54.033 --> 13:55.001
Let's write this packet.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.511
- Suzanne Somers!
- Somers!

14:10.316 --> 14:12.384
That is indeed a packet.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.386
It wasn't as fun as I thought

14:13.387 --> 14:15.087
it was going to be, but--

14:15.088 --> 14:17.321
No, but we did get to eat candy, so.

14:17.322 --> 14:18.191
Should I hit send?

14:18.192 --> 14:20.292
Yeah, hit send.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.761
Ah!

14:23.429 --> 14:24.429
Finished?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.764
Yes, whether or not

14:25.765 --> 14:28.433
we get this job is now in God's hands.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.669
Yes, he mostly concerns himself

14:29.670 --> 14:31.236
with staffing matters.

14:31.237 --> 14:33.137
I am so proud of you, Noodles.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.238
I can't believe how you just

14:34.239 --> 14:36.008
pushed that out all by yourself.

14:36.009 --> 14:38.477
God, you're so strong.

14:38.478 --> 14:39.645
I wish I could've helped.

14:39.646 --> 14:41.613
Thanks, Crackers.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.416
Text me if you don't want duck for dinner.

14:43.417 --> 14:45.685
Consider yourself texted.

14:50.123 --> 14:51.391
You think he knows?

14:51.392 --> 14:53.191
I hope not.

14:53.192 --> 14:54.594
Arthur would be a good dad.

14:54.595 --> 14:57.496
A weird dad, but a good dad.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.363
Oh, I don't know what to do.

14:59.364 --> 15:00.464
Let's fall asleep watching

15:00.465 --> 15:02.301
The Talk like our forefathers did.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.503
Oh, okay.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.709
Oh my God, Julie, wake up.

15:09.710 --> 15:11.109
What?

15:11.110 --> 15:12.745
Um, it turns out Richard does

15:12.746 --> 15:15.280
come from a performance background.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.614
What do you mean, porn?

15:16.615 --> 15:19.417
So what? I'd do porn if I had a thigh gap.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.421
No, no, no, look at this, please.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.524
Puppetry of the Penis?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.125
Richard was in that?

15:27.126 --> 15:29.594
- Puppetry of the Penis!
- Ah!

15:29.595 --> 15:31.731
Don't you remember, it
started in Australia!

15:31.732 --> 15:33.165
I saw that Real Sex,

15:33.166 --> 15:34.598
there was the guy that was, like,

15:34.599 --> 15:36.233
"I was at the bar doing dick tricks.

15:36.234 --> 15:37.234
There was another bloke

15:37.235 --> 15:38.469
and he was doing dick tricks

15:38.470 --> 15:40.171
and we were like, "Let's team up!"

15:40.172 --> 15:42.640
That was--
that happens in Australia!

15:42.641 --> 15:43.741
You want to watch this?

15:43.742 --> 15:45.075
I want to see what he can do.

15:45.076 --> 15:48.045
Okay, he'll turn his
penis into a tangerine.

15:48.046 --> 15:49.582
You met the curious elephant

15:49.583 --> 15:51.383
and the hairy hyena.

15:51.384 --> 15:52.485
But who here wants to see

15:52.486 --> 15:55.487
a juicy submarine sandwich?

15:55.488 --> 15:58.590
No, no! No! No! No!

15:58.591 --> 16:00.525
We just stayed up all night,

16:00.526 --> 16:02.193
based on a suggestion coming from someone

16:02.194 --> 16:04.528
who's more likely to know
the founder of Burning Man

16:04.529 --> 16:06.297
than have any legitimate connections

16:06.298 --> 16:07.298
in show business.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.968
It must be so stretched out.

16:08.969 --> 16:10.068
Oh, my God.

16:10.604 --> 16:12.571
Oh, my God.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.338
Ah!

16:13.339 --> 16:14.673
Who is it? No.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.707
Hey, Richard?

16:15.708 --> 16:17.676
No.

16:17.677 --> 16:21.079
No, I'm gonna put you on speaker, hold on.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.281
What shape is his penis in right now--

16:22.282 --> 16:23.215
Oh, sorry.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.381
Hi Billy, hi Julie.

16:24.382 --> 16:26.283
So the head writer of Even
Later with Chris Hardwick

16:26.284 --> 16:27.585
loved your packet and he wants to meet

16:27.586 --> 16:28.586
with you this afternoon.

16:28.587 --> 16:29.753
- Whoa!
- Oh my God.

16:29.754 --> 16:31.355
- That's amazing!
- That's amazing!

16:31.356 --> 16:33.092
Thank you so much, we'll
call you right back!

16:33.093 --> 16:34.192
Thank you!

16:34.193 --> 16:36.329
The greatest dick trick
the devil ever played

16:36.330 --> 16:39.030
was getting us that interview.

16:39.031 --> 16:41.066
Oh my God, oh.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.132
He's--
you know what?

16:42.133 --> 16:43.603
He's got a pretty asshole.

16:56.449 --> 16:57.315
Wow.

16:57.316 --> 16:58.383
The Doors!

16:58.384 --> 16:59.350
You can really play.

16:59.351 --> 17:00.451
Yeah, I'm a lefty,

17:00.452 --> 17:02.622
I play a righty guitar
though, like Hendrix?

17:02.623 --> 17:04.589
Just like Jimi Henge.

17:04.589 --> 17:07.192
So, Billy and Julie.

17:07.193 --> 17:09.026
Yes, thank you so much
for meeting with us.

17:09.027 --> 17:10.426
We're really excited to be here.

17:10.428 --> 17:12.598
And, uh, Richard said that
you really liked our packet.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.330
Yes.

17:13.332 --> 17:14.265
So, thank you very much,

17:14.266 --> 17:15.266
that means a lot coming from you.

17:15.267 --> 17:16.534
We worked really hard on it.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.371
To be honest, I didn't read it,

17:18.372 --> 17:21.106
but I'm sure it's awesome.

17:21.107 --> 17:23.040
I mean, network has been up my fuckin' ass

17:23.040 --> 17:24.343
about a diversity hire

17:24.344 --> 17:27.145
ever since Jezebel did another post

17:27.146 --> 17:30.014
about how there's no female
writers in late night.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.049
So do I count as a woman because I'm gay?

17:32.050 --> 17:34.018
All right, so let me level with you guys.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.354
Unless you take a fuckin' shit

17:35.355 --> 17:36.621
right on my desk,

17:36.622 --> 17:39.056
or if you aren't cool, you got this.

17:39.057 --> 17:40.524
What do you mean by cool?

17:40.525 --> 17:42.126
You know, just how it's, like, not safe

17:42.127 --> 17:44.328
to joke about anything anymore, right?

17:44.329 --> 17:46.030
You guys probably deal
with that shit a lot.

17:46.031 --> 17:48.032
We want to make the show
that we want to make.

17:48.033 --> 17:50.067
We don't want to have any regrets.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.468
We don't want to wake up the next morning

17:51.469 --> 17:52.703
and think, "You know what?

17:52.704 --> 17:53.504
We shouldn't have taken

17:53.505 --> 17:54.574
that network note,

17:54.575 --> 17:57.008
we should have said no."

17:57.009 --> 17:59.777
Everyone we bump into
has all these regrets.

17:59.778 --> 18:02.415
I mean, glow in the dark ping pong lady,

18:02.416 --> 18:04.215
scabby brows.

18:04.216 --> 18:05.683
Space camp wheelchair.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.017
What's space camp wheelchair?

18:07.018 --> 18:07.720
Is that in your packet?

18:07.721 --> 18:09.020
Chris'll love that.

18:09.021 --> 18:10.421
Everyone we've spoken
to in the past 24 hours

18:10.422 --> 18:12.489
should have said no when they said yes.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.091
And now it's time for us

18:14.092 --> 18:15.459
to learn from their mistakes?

18:15.460 --> 18:16.594
That's right. And you're gonna be

18:16.595 --> 18:18.329
the first person we say no to.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.130
I mean, can you imagine
working with this guy?

18:20.131 --> 18:21.332
Is this some kind of bit?

18:21.333 --> 18:22.700
And whether or not I'm pregnant,

18:22.701 --> 18:24.303
I am getting an abortion today.

18:24.304 --> 18:25.370
That's right.

18:25.371 --> 18:27.371
I am terminating this opportunity

18:27.372 --> 18:29.041
before it gets any bigger.

18:29.042 --> 18:30.141
All right, cool.

18:30.142 --> 18:31.609
Uh, well, I got a meeting, so.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.478
Oh, you have a meeting?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.279
Oh, where, in 1968,

18:34.280 --> 18:36.281
before feminism was invented?

18:36.282 --> 18:38.115
Do you think you're cool
or like, punk rock,

18:38.116 --> 18:40.184
why, because you DVR Anthony Bourdain?

18:40.185 --> 18:41.485
You're probably one of those guys

18:41.486 --> 18:43.723
that thinks John Lennon
was edgier than Yoko.

18:43.724 --> 18:45.724
Yoko Ono was the best thing

18:45.725 --> 18:47.424
that ever happened at John Lennon.

18:47.425 --> 18:49.493
The Beatles were holding Yoko Ono back.

18:49.494 --> 18:51.195
The only reason I wish Jim Morrison

18:51.196 --> 18:53.030
was still alive today is just to see

18:53.031 --> 18:54.166
how fat he could have gotten.

18:54.167 --> 18:55.333
Oh my God!

18:55.334 --> 18:56.702
Jim Morrison would have had

18:56.703 --> 18:59.204
a field day at a Dairy Queen.

18:59.205 --> 19:00.537
I mean, could you imagine

19:00.538 --> 19:02.508
Jim Morrison around a Blizzard?

19:02.509 --> 19:05.210
Holy shit, the Blizzard King.

19:07.246 --> 19:10.481
All right. The Blizzard King
is fuckin' funny, though.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.615
Uh, Stephanie, will you bring me

19:11.616 --> 19:13.486
that black guy's packet, please?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.659
That was intensely satisfying.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.027
We can say no to things
we don't want to do!

19:23.028 --> 19:24.128
Yeah, and if Richard freaks out

19:24.129 --> 19:25.663
about how we treated Adam,

19:25.664 --> 19:28.300
I will remind him he used
to be a penis puppeteer.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.503
Billy, I need you to leave the bathroom.

19:32.504 --> 19:33.570
- Why?
- Please, right now.

19:33.571 --> 19:34.705
- Okay.
- For lady reasons.

19:34.706 --> 19:35.973
- Okay.
- Thank you, thank you.

19:35.974 --> 19:36.640
- Thank you.
- All right.

19:36.641 --> 19:37.343
- Okay.
- Bye.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.411
All right.

19:39.412 --> 19:41.079
I'm not pregnant!

19:41.080 --> 19:43.348
I love my period!

19:43.349 --> 19:46.451
These pipes are clean!

19:46.452 --> 19:48.286
Okay, congratulations.

19:48.287 --> 19:51.156
Oh, Julie, it's Richard.

19:51.157 --> 19:52.457
Hey.

19:52.458 --> 19:55.793
So, you're not mad at us
for turning down the job?

19:55.794 --> 19:58.462
Nah, that guy's supposed
to be a real asshole.

19:58.463 --> 19:59.730
I just think it's great to have clients

19:59.731 --> 20:01.400
who know what they don't want.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.635
C-- c-- c-- clients?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.303
Whoa!

20:05.304 --> 20:06.503
I just wish when I was your age,

20:06.504 --> 20:08.172
I'd said no to an opportunity

20:08.173 --> 20:09.575
that my mate presented me with.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.310
Um, Richard, I think I know

20:12.311 --> 20:13.612
what performance opportunity

20:13.613 --> 20:15.046
you're talking about.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.749
We've seen the submarine sandwich.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.984
Okay, well, a youthful
indiscretion perhaps,

20:19.985 --> 20:21.518
that lasted, like, a decade.

20:21.519 --> 20:22.988
You're a grown man who put your penis

20:22.989 --> 20:25.056
into the shape of a Koala.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.159
Okay, okay, Even Later is out.

20:27.160 --> 20:27.726
Right.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.761
Well you've already conquered

20:28.762 --> 20:31.296
the world of magazines, I see.

20:31.297 --> 20:32.396
What are you talking about?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.532
These columns are amazing.

20:33.533 --> 20:34.466
What?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.666
Well, your columns in here.

20:35.667 --> 20:37.067
- They're fantastic.
- Mm-hm.

20:37.068 --> 20:38.170
We're columnists?

20:38.171 --> 20:40.572
Yeah, page 484, 485.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.239
"We Should Be Allowed To
Have Cookies For Breakfast"

20:42.240 --> 20:43.240
by Julie Kessler.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.608
Billy, you're in here, too!

20:44.609 --> 20:46.779
Yes, I submitted a column to HuffPo!

20:46.780 --> 20:48.046
I totally forgot!

20:48.047 --> 20:49.380
Me too, holy shit.

20:49.381 --> 20:51.550
I didn't know that they
published it, oh my God.

20:51.551 --> 20:55.019
"Why I Hate Other Gay
Men" by Billy Epstein.

20:55.020 --> 20:56.221
It holds up.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.556
We're in a magazine, yes!

20:58.557 --> 21:00.425
You guys are on fire!

21:00.426 --> 21:04.129
Richard, now that we're
your new favorite clients,

21:04.130 --> 21:06.064
can you please do us a favor

21:06.065 --> 21:09.033
and show us just one dick trick, please!

21:09.034 --> 21:10.300
- Oh no.
- Please, please, please?

21:10.301 --> 21:11.602
- Everybody ready?
- No, Julie!

21:11.603 --> 21:12.603
- Are you ready?
- No, we're in public!

21:12.604 --> 21:14.006
Yes, we're gonna take you

21:14.007 --> 21:17.008
on a safari of the Australian Outback.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.577
Yeah, yeah. All right, all right.

21:19.578 --> 21:21.011
Guess what kind of critter this is.

21:21.012 --> 21:22.114
- Oh, um.
- Oh, um...

21:22.115 --> 21:23.748
Um, um, it's a wombat!

21:23.749 --> 21:24.683
It's a wombat!

21:24.684 --> 21:26.417
It's Nicole Kidman!

21:26.418 --> 21:27.351
It's a kangaroo?

21:27.352 --> 21:28.352
It's a kangaroo?

21:28.353 --> 21:29.455
I could beat up a kangaroo!

21:30.964 --> 21:33.077
