<i>Previously on The Bridge...</i>

00:03.735 --> 00:06.477
I'll let her go...
for a price.

00:06.512 --> 00:07.705
It's all over the Internet.

00:07.772 --> 00:09.573
They're calling him
the Bridge Butcher.

00:09.641 --> 00:11.226
She's got a day a best.

00:11.308 --> 00:12.607
Frye just got the call.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.122
Who'll be making the drop?

00:14.279 --> 00:15.479
Gedman.

00:15.547 --> 00:17.481
I look forward
to meeting him.

00:17.549 --> 00:20.351
- You Ralph Gedman?
- Yeah.

00:20.418 --> 00:22.299
I'm supposed
to give you this.

Hi.

04:48.867 --> 04:50.802
Sonya Cross, El Paso PD.

04:50.869 --> 04:52.680
- I know.
- Hey.

04:53.538 --> 04:55.006
You don't answer you phone.

04:55.241 --> 04:56.624
Sunday night?

04:57.703 --> 04:58.504
Gus...

_____

05:00.056 --> 05:01.346
What are you doing here?

05:01.414 --> 05:03.348
I went to the Palm Motel.

05:03.416 --> 05:04.349
By yourself?

05:04.417 --> 05:05.350
Yes.

05:05.418 --> 05:06.718
They I.D.'d Ralph Gedman.

05:06.786 --> 05:09.387
He visited Cristina Fuentes
every week.

05:09.455 --> 05:11.823
Okay, okay.
Have dinner with us.

05:11.890 --> 05:13.825
Gedman was a personal kill.

05:13.892 --> 05:15.059
Why else cut his head off?

05:15.127 --> 05:16.828
And whose gonna be next?

05:16.895 --> 05:20.548
20 minutes. And then we
talk about beheadings.

05:22.931 --> 05:24.537

Oh...

05:35.814 --> 05:37.682

05:41.787 --> 05:44.422
Why do you keep looking
at me?

05:44.490 --> 05:47.225
I don't.

05:47.292 --> 05:48.615
I'm not.

05:50.162 --> 05:53.598
Gus has been following
the case on the Internet.

05:53.666 --> 05:55.600
How is the girl
from the desert?

05:55.668 --> 05:56.568
Still unconscious.

05:56.635 --> 05:58.705
Mm, we're not supposed
to talk about that.

06:00.033 --> 06:01.756
Right.

06:01.907 --> 06:03.207
Mmm!

06:03.275 --> 06:06.183
You left your wallet
at Charlotte Millwright's.

06:09.796 --> 06:11.094
Thank you.

06:11.654 --> 06:13.240
Who's Charlotte Millwright?

06:13.275 --> 06:14.719
The woman on the bridge.

06:14.787 --> 06:17.154
Part of the case.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.192
Not very hungry?

06:21.970 --> 06:23.609
Doesn't taste good.

06:27.266 --> 06:29.901

08:30.422 --> 08:32.390
Came in last night.
Shoplifting.

08:32.457 --> 08:34.392
No one came to pick her up?

08:34.458 --> 08:36.561
- I don't know.
- Hey.

08:36.629 --> 08:39.898
Fed nuthuggers are hogging
all the info on Gedman.

08:39.965 --> 08:40.932
Find a bead?

08:41.000 --> 08:43.267
Bigger than the last one,
in with the money.

08:43.335 --> 08:45.269
Have you seen his FBI file?

08:45.337 --> 08:47.530
No, ma'am,
but they have.

08:53.178 --> 08:55.112
Give us a little time.

08:55.180 --> 08:57.214
We need to see
Ralph Gedman's file.

08:57.282 --> 08:59.617
Look,
he was one of ours.

08:59.685 --> 09:01.739
He took that video
of Cristina Fuentes,

09:01.777 --> 09:03.898
and that was the first link
between two victims,

09:03.973 --> 09:05.837
and that's our only lead.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.086
You'll get your chance.

09:09.469 --> 09:10.912
There he goes.

09:11.296 --> 09:13.932
Like I said, nuthuggers.

09:15.431 --> 09:16.730
Where have you been?

09:17.664 --> 09:19.062
In the back.

09:20.105 --> 09:21.372
Sleeping?

09:21.440 --> 09:24.308
Yeah, Sonya, sleeping.

09:26.913 --> 09:29.447
Damn. Sorry, buddy.

09:39.904 --> 09:42.498
The killer knew Gedman
well enough

09:42.752 --> 09:44.936
to know about the video.

09:45.464 --> 09:48.299
We dropped the tail
on Steven Linder?

09:48.842 --> 09:51.474
Yes, he's no longer
our person of interest.

09:51.509 --> 09:53.404
He's of interest to me.

09:53.472 --> 09:55.033
Can we focus on the killer?

09:55.038 --> 09:57.950
You can.
I'm gonna find this <i>pendejo.</i>

09:58.027 --> 10:00.319
- Hey.
- Thanks.

10:02.122 --> 10:03.915
He got the toss last night.

10:04.049 --> 10:06.784
He needs to go get mad
at somebody.

10:06.852 --> 10:10.588
Oh. Okay.

10:10.656 --> 10:12.289
Where's your mother?

10:12.357 --> 10:13.424
She hasn't been home.

10:13.492 --> 10:16.094
- How long?
- Two days.

10:16.161 --> 10:18.513
Jesus. That woman.

10:19.698 --> 10:22.033
I didn't steal the earrings.

10:22.677 --> 10:25.055
They let you try them on,
and I just... I forgot.

10:25.090 --> 10:26.537
Okay. I buy that.

10:31.092 --> 10:32.289
How much was the bail?

10:32.477 --> 10:33.897
More than your mother
can afford,

10:34.032 --> 10:36.848
and I'm gonna charge her,
believe me.

10:37.016 --> 10:39.117
Can I stay with you?

10:39.184 --> 10:40.952
No, honey.

10:41.020 --> 10:43.346
Heather's not used to kids.

10:44.036 --> 10:45.341
Okay.

10:48.049 --> 10:49.479
I can walk.

10:49.504 --> 10:52.196
- I'll drive you.
- No, it... it's fine.

10:52.264 --> 10:54.565
I do have
an appointment in 20.

10:55.295 --> 10:56.633
Bye.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.417
Hey.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.293
We're good, right?

11:03.942 --> 11:05.959
Yeah. Right.

11:06.107 --> 11:07.788
All right.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.506
She'll be unconscious
for a while.

11:16.609 --> 11:17.825
She still hasn't spoken.

11:17.941 --> 11:19.140
- Just a few words.
- Like what?

11:19.259 --> 11:20.391
_____

11:20.531 --> 11:21.770
Like that.

11:24.029 --> 11:26.492
No, I agree.
Okay, bye.

11:27.241 --> 11:29.306
Who were you talking to?

11:31.275 --> 11:32.827
It's none of your business.

11:32.899 --> 11:34.273
Was that him?

11:34.308 --> 11:36.578
If it was, I would have to tell you,
wouldn't I?

11:38.468 --> 11:40.012
Doesn't mean that you would.

11:40.071 --> 11:41.618
Mm.

11:43.990 --> 11:46.239
Two full days,
and he still hasn't called.

11:46.484 --> 11:49.545
That's my math, too.

11:50.723 --> 11:53.110
I don't understand why.

11:53.792 --> 11:56.069
Maybe he's resting
on his laurels,

11:56.204 --> 11:59.199
after he made you and the Feds
look like a bunch of chumps.

12:02.201 --> 12:04.370
You do a lot of drugs,
don't you?

12:08.197 --> 12:09.651
What?

12:10.042 --> 12:11.989
Why?

12:14.793 --> 12:16.871
I'm not telling you that.

12:21.887 --> 12:23.696
'Cause they're there...

12:23.940 --> 12:25.951
and they're fun.

12:27.426 --> 12:31.604
They make you hate yourself
just a little bit less.

12:52.851 --> 12:54.300
Where's Eva?

12:55.289 --> 12:56.518
Who?

12:56.553 --> 12:58.593
You stole her.

13:00.798 --> 13:01.823
No.

13:01.961 --> 13:03.431
<i>Sí, sí, sí...</i>

13:03.466 --> 13:06.435
I need her back.

13:40.765 --> 13:44.035
Steven Linder,
I know you're in there.

13:55.914 --> 13:57.115
Steven.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.169
Yeah?

14:00.204 --> 14:03.687
Detective Marco Ruiz.
Remember me?

14:03.755 --> 14:04.889
Yeah.

14:04.957 --> 14:07.012
Can I come in?

14:08.894 --> 14:11.162
Um, I prefer that you didn't.

14:11.230 --> 14:13.703
It's, uh, it's kind of a mess.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.454
I was thinking
what you said the other day...

14:17.754 --> 14:19.647
That you help people.

14:19.671 --> 14:21.867
Are you helping anyone now?

14:24.977 --> 14:27.578
Um, I work at the shelter.

14:27.645 --> 14:30.291
You go over
the bridge a lot?

14:30.407 --> 14:31.813
Some.

14:32.217 --> 14:35.068
12 times last month.

14:36.355 --> 14:38.589
I like Mexican food.

14:38.656 --> 14:41.647
No white person
goes to Juarez that often,

14:41.839 --> 14:43.794
unless they're up to something.

14:44.129 --> 14:45.913
Oh? Like what.

14:46.831 --> 14:49.520
That's what
I'm going to find out.

14:52.304 --> 14:54.805
Okay.

14:55.390 --> 14:57.320
Okay.

14:58.645 --> 15:01.025
You have a good day.

15:44.818 --> 15:47.153
I wish we could tap
Frye's phone.

15:47.220 --> 15:48.353
Would be nice.

15:48.421 --> 15:51.359
He's not going to tell us
if the killer calls again.

15:51.394 --> 15:53.680
He wants the story for himself.

15:53.715 --> 15:55.282
Selfish.

15:55.317 --> 15:57.027
How long can they stonewall?

15:57.095 --> 15:58.229
Their property.

15:58.297 --> 16:00.043
Could be a spell.

16:03.235 --> 16:06.437
I thought we were
one big happy team.

16:07.557 --> 16:10.208
Hey, you know,
I need a root canal.

16:10.249 --> 16:12.434
That's why I'm in a mood.
What's your excuse?

16:12.544 --> 16:14.145
He slept on a bench.

16:14.180 --> 16:15.846
He did what?

16:15.914 --> 16:17.014
In the back room.

16:17.082 --> 16:19.450
I can speak for myself,
thank you.

16:19.518 --> 16:22.067
Slept on a bench
in the back room.

16:25.857 --> 16:28.236
Well, you got me beat.

16:33.365 --> 16:35.700
What was the fight about?

16:35.767 --> 16:36.900
What do you think?

16:36.968 --> 16:39.770
How would I know?

16:39.838 --> 16:41.834
Sonya, you gave me back
my wallet

16:41.869 --> 16:44.074
right in front of my wife.

16:45.505 --> 16:46.534
So...

16:46.778 --> 16:49.313
I dropped it
in another woman's house.

16:49.381 --> 16:51.533
You had sex
with Charlotte Millwright?

16:52.322 --> 16:53.697
Yes.

16:53.732 --> 16:55.219
You're married.

16:55.287 --> 16:58.589
Yes, I know.

16:58.657 --> 17:00.391
Look, we're partners.

17:00.459 --> 17:03.160
Partners look out
for each other.

17:03.228 --> 17:05.492
That's an unwritten rule.

17:07.310 --> 17:09.432
Just forget it.

17:10.469 --> 17:14.037
Oh, man.

17:17.502 --> 17:19.444
Where are you sleeping
tonight?

17:19.578 --> 17:21.444
I don't know.

17:22.361 --> 17:23.430
I have a couch.

17:23.565 --> 17:26.156
You can sleep on the couch
if you like.

19:31.810 --> 19:33.411
Hmm.

19:33.478 --> 19:35.379
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:35.447 --> 19:36.881
What are you writing?

19:37.427 --> 19:40.234
Ask me no questions,
and I'll tell you no lies.

19:42.186 --> 19:44.321
I don't like to drink alone.

19:44.389 --> 19:47.157
Well, I don't like
weird unannounced visits.

19:47.225 --> 19:50.795
We have things in common.

19:50.862 --> 19:52.362
Oh, yeah? Such as?

19:52.431 --> 19:54.064
Well, Gedman...

19:54.132 --> 19:56.099
The killer left me his head.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.736
Left you his body.

19:58.804 --> 20:01.539
Very, very special.

20:04.643 --> 20:06.610
Did you see him?

20:06.678 --> 20:08.479
No.

20:08.547 --> 20:09.780
I did.

20:09.848 --> 20:10.915
Sort of.

20:10.982 --> 20:14.452
I feel like I can almost describe him,
but then...

20:14.519 --> 20:17.688
nothing's there.

20:17.756 --> 20:19.790
I can hear his voice.

20:19.858 --> 20:21.959
What's it sound like?

20:22.026 --> 20:24.127
Hollow.

20:24.195 --> 20:25.162
Huh.

20:25.229 --> 20:26.923
Shit. Ai, yi, yi.

20:27.039 --> 20:28.523
Sorry.

20:29.337 --> 20:30.973
So sorry.

20:31.169 --> 20:33.677
- This is where I work!
- It was an accident.

20:42.814 --> 20:44.618
She's talking.

20:46.885 --> 20:48.452
What's this?

20:48.520 --> 20:49.960
Daniel Frye's phone.

20:50.859 --> 20:52.271
How did you get it?

20:53.058 --> 20:56.528
_____

20:56.663 --> 20:58.646
_____

20:59.063 --> 21:01.365
She says she saw a car.

21:01.432 --> 21:03.133
What did it look like?

21:03.401 --> 21:04.589
_____

21:05.804 --> 21:07.603
_____

21:08.504 --> 21:09.478
_____

21:13.978 --> 21:15.744
_____

21:16.749 --> 21:19.425
_____

21:21.312 --> 21:21.983
_____

21:22.921 --> 21:24.735
_____

21:25.190 --> 21:26.600
_____

21:27.664 --> 21:29.020
_____

21:29.761 --> 21:30.761
What is she saying?

21:30.829 --> 21:31.810
Hold on.

21:31.849 --> 21:34.079
_____

21:34.253 --> 21:35.190
_____

21:35.584 --> 21:36.296
_____

21:37.435 --> 21:39.637
She wants asylum.

21:46.917 --> 21:48.453
You going
to the library opening?

21:48.661 --> 21:52.252
I should.
I have to. Want to.

21:52.287 --> 21:53.554
But...

21:53.589 --> 21:56.587
But, um,
I just haven't gotten tickets.

21:57.819 --> 22:00.810
You seem, uh...
distracted.

22:02.213 --> 22:03.675
Am I?

22:03.710 --> 22:05.133
Yeah, what's going on.

22:10.472 --> 22:12.540
My husband.

22:12.608 --> 22:14.142
He's, um...

22:14.209 --> 22:15.710
Is he all right?

22:15.778 --> 22:18.179
Yeah.

22:19.715 --> 22:22.316
We're just not doing well.

22:22.384 --> 22:26.254
Oh. I'm sorry.

22:29.125 --> 22:32.393
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:32.461 --> 22:34.595
Kenny, this is Gus,
my stepson.

22:34.664 --> 22:37.732
Oh, I've heard about you.

22:37.800 --> 22:39.233
You have?

22:39.301 --> 22:41.936
She brags about you
all the time.

22:42.004 --> 22:44.005
She does?

22:44.073 --> 22:45.140
I'll, uh...

22:45.207 --> 22:47.330
- I'll see you back there.
- Okay.

22:49.378 --> 22:51.279
How are you?

22:51.346 --> 22:53.948
Okay.

22:54.016 --> 22:57.652
I, uh... I wondered
about a ride over the bridge.

22:57.720 --> 22:59.837
Sure.
Around 6:00?

23:01.057 --> 23:03.717
I know you're mad
at my dad.

23:05.861 --> 23:07.708
Yeah.

23:08.530 --> 23:11.099
He doesn't think
about anybody but himself.

23:11.167 --> 23:16.146
You know, how it affects you or...
or me.

23:16.906 --> 23:19.697
Gus, you know
you can stay at the house

23:19.814 --> 23:21.459
no matter what, right?

23:21.744 --> 23:23.678
I can?

23:23.746 --> 23:26.214
Of course.
I'm not mad at you.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.282
Because I-I could stay
with Tico... It's-it's fine.

23:28.350 --> 23:29.851
No, no, no, no, no, no.

23:29.919 --> 23:32.149
You stay home.
Okay?

23:32.419 --> 23:34.710
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:13.863 --> 24:15.096
Yeah.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.738
There's a problem with Maria.

24:19.019 --> 24:20.427
Which is...

24:20.495 --> 24:22.151
You tell him.

24:22.171 --> 24:24.639
She wants asylum
before she talks.

24:24.706 --> 24:27.976
She has information,
but he encouraged her to wait.

24:28.043 --> 24:29.343
Really?

24:30.281 --> 24:31.622
She has a baby in Houston.

24:31.748 --> 24:33.214
She's been through a lot.

24:33.282 --> 24:34.182
So she wants a visa.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.658
I'd like to help her.

24:35.693 --> 24:37.839
Well, I know somebody
at Homeland Security.

24:37.874 --> 24:39.220
It's gonna take forever.

24:39.288 --> 24:41.222
Oh, look, she needs this.

24:41.290 --> 24:43.224
And there's a chance
that we can help her.

24:43.292 --> 24:45.226
So I'll reach out.

24:46.003 --> 24:47.513
Excuse me.
Detective Ruiz?

24:47.548 --> 24:49.247
Excuse me.

24:49.899 --> 24:51.833
Charlotte Millwright
has called twice.

24:51.901 --> 24:53.835
What would you like
me to say to her?

24:53.903 --> 24:56.838
Um, I'll call her back.

24:56.906 --> 24:59.174
- Okay.
- What?

24:59.241 --> 25:00.909
Nothing.

25:00.976 --> 25:04.645
Just seen it too many times.

26:08.443 --> 26:10.845
Oh, dear.

26:34.736 --> 26:35.917
Hello?

26:36.025 --> 26:37.272
Danny?

26:37.339 --> 26:39.607
- Danny...
- Danny Frye?

26:39.674 --> 26:41.675
Who's this?

26:53.822 --> 26:55.530
Daniel?

26:56.096 --> 26:58.206
Sonya Cross,
El Paso PD.

27:03.420 --> 27:05.777
Call back. Call back.

27:15.744 --> 27:18.146
Sonya Cross,
El Paso PD.

27:18.213 --> 27:20.848
You're working late.

27:20.916 --> 27:21.849
Yes.

27:21.917 --> 27:24.018
How did you get that phone?

27:24.086 --> 27:26.354
You don't like surprises?

27:26.422 --> 27:28.838
You talk
as if you know me.

27:30.359 --> 27:33.706
- I understand you.
- Maybe.

27:34.697 --> 27:36.896
I've been studying you.

27:37.266 --> 27:39.467
And eventually, I will find you.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.235
We'll see.

27:41.303 --> 27:43.204
You knew Ralph Gedman.

27:43.272 --> 27:45.206
Better than others.

27:45.274 --> 27:46.874
You knew his secrets.

27:46.942 --> 27:48.676
I showed what he was.

27:48.743 --> 27:51.212
How about Cristina Fuentes?

27:51.280 --> 27:52.947
How'd you get the video?

27:53.015 --> 27:54.715
I'm not special.

27:54.783 --> 27:56.951
That wasn't the question.

27:57.019 --> 27:59.621
If I knew, others knew.

28:01.090 --> 28:02.190
What others?

28:02.257 --> 28:05.226
Institutions know,
and they ignore,

28:05.294 --> 28:06.995
and they protect.

28:07.062 --> 28:10.831
Gedman's institution?
The FBI?

28:12.101 --> 28:14.102
Hello?

28:16.505 --> 28:18.473
Hello?

28:29.037 --> 28:30.537
How's Will doing?

28:30.605 --> 28:34.374
Oh, he's still fightin'
the good fight.

28:34.375 --> 28:36.910
They got him stationed
someplace north of Jalalabad.

28:37.695 --> 28:39.206
He can't tell us where.

28:39.241 --> 28:40.681
- That's hard.
- Yep.

28:40.748 --> 28:42.883
Carmen's going more
than a little crazy.

28:42.951 --> 28:44.379
That why you're here?

28:44.414 --> 28:45.886
No. No, I wouldn' presume.

28:45.954 --> 28:48.123
I'm here because of the woman
in the desert.

28:48.158 --> 28:50.557
- She's asked for asylum.
- Ah, I bet she did.

28:50.625 --> 28:53.433
And I could use
her cooperation.

28:53.468 --> 28:55.020
We talking U Visa?

28:55.357 --> 28:57.429
Yeah. She's the victim
of a public crime.

28:57.464 --> 28:58.567
That's a tough one, Hank.

28:58.602 --> 29:00.175
She could help us
catch this guy.

29:00.210 --> 29:01.335
We have no dog
in that fight.

29:01.402 --> 29:02.369
Yes, you do.

29:02.437 --> 29:04.338
Homeland Security
doesn't want him out there

29:04.374 --> 29:06.210
making political statements
about the border,

29:06.245 --> 29:08.575
getting everybody all riled up.

29:08.643 --> 29:10.577
I'll try.

29:10.645 --> 29:12.012
Good. Clock's ticking.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.680
Can you try right now?

29:14.248 --> 29:16.128
Geez, you're bossy.

29:16.684 --> 29:17.917
Not always.

29:17.985 --> 29:19.686
I'll make some calls.

29:19.754 --> 29:21.688
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

29:21.756 --> 29:23.776
- Good to see you.
- Mm-hmm.

29:36.271 --> 29:38.072
Hey.

29:38.139 --> 29:39.974
Hello.

29:40.041 --> 29:42.042
Hi.

29:44.880 --> 29:46.413
How are you?

29:47.273 --> 29:48.923
I'm fine.
Do you want anything?

29:48.958 --> 29:51.279
Uh, no, thanks.

29:57.558 --> 29:59.818
Actually, I'm not fine.

30:00.595 --> 30:02.342
No?

30:02.590 --> 30:04.618
Do you know Graciela Rivera?

30:04.653 --> 30:07.999
Yeah, everyone in Juarez
knows her.

30:08.869 --> 30:11.480
'Cause I'm mixed up with her.

30:12.307 --> 30:14.938
No, no,
you don't want that.

30:17.779 --> 30:21.526
The night
that you were... over...

30:23.384 --> 30:26.243
she strung up
one of my horses.

30:27.755 --> 30:30.123
Yep, that's Graciela.

30:30.191 --> 30:31.325
Is she crazy?

30:31.392 --> 30:33.872
She'll burn your life down.

30:34.629 --> 30:36.756
So what do I do?

30:38.232 --> 30:41.402
Wait. Just... wait.

30:42.970 --> 30:46.306
Power like hers...
it snuffs itself out.

30:46.474 --> 30:48.176
Wait for how long?

30:48.705 --> 30:50.965
A year, two.

30:51.278 --> 30:52.879
Until it's over.

30:52.947 --> 30:54.047
So I just let her

30:54.114 --> 30:56.049
move these people
through my land.

30:56.116 --> 30:57.384
Eh...

30:57.452 --> 31:00.721
Don't tell me too much, please.

31:00.788 --> 31:04.909
Okay.
So I take the long view.

31:05.960 --> 31:09.914
Just...
Live your life.

31:12.333 --> 31:14.497
How's your life?

31:14.802 --> 31:18.060
A little rough.

31:23.644 --> 31:25.956
Thank you for meeting me.

31:27.882 --> 31:31.518
I have to take
the long view, too.

31:56.058 --> 31:57.100
_____

31:58.446 --> 32:00.068
<i>Americana?</i>

32:08.356 --> 32:10.302
D-Do you want to come up?

32:11.686 --> 32:13.727
I got beer.

32:32.046 --> 32:33.699
Where were you?

32:34.349 --> 32:36.269
Charlotte Millwright.

32:36.818 --> 32:38.300
More sex?

32:38.509 --> 32:40.870
No.

32:41.585 --> 32:43.980
Did you steal
Daniel Frye's phone?

32:45.192 --> 32:48.394
Ask me no questions,
I'll tell you no lies.

32:48.463 --> 32:51.130
That's against the law.

32:51.198 --> 32:53.533
Maybe I took in by mistake.

32:53.601 --> 32:57.804
Maybe he left it somewhere
and I found it.

33:01.041 --> 33:03.577
He called.

33:03.644 --> 33:05.051
The killer.

33:05.129 --> 33:06.494
And...

33:06.581 --> 33:10.350
The FBI knew
about Cristina and the video.

33:10.417 --> 33:11.852
That's what they've been hiding.

33:11.919 --> 33:15.088
That's why
they won't share their files.

33:15.155 --> 33:17.557
Well, they will now.

33:20.060 --> 33:23.329
What am I gonna say to Fry
about this phone?

33:23.397 --> 33:27.032
Just drop it into
the "Lost and Found," El Paso Times.

33:28.435 --> 33:29.581
Any luck?

33:29.688 --> 33:31.840
As a matter of fact, yes.

33:32.172 --> 33:34.007
Got Maria into the system.

33:34.074 --> 33:35.479
U Visa.

33:35.867 --> 33:37.096
Great.

33:37.131 --> 33:39.218
Yeah.
They're processing the papers.

33:39.253 --> 33:41.230
You'll have them
to give to her in the morning.

33:41.265 --> 33:44.718
Thank you, Hank.
Really. It means a lot to me.

33:45.642 --> 33:47.250
All right,
I'm gonna go home.

33:47.254 --> 33:48.655
Yeah, all right.

33:48.723 --> 33:50.056
You coming?

33:50.422 --> 33:52.204
Oh. Yeah.

33:53.093 --> 33:54.899
Thank you.

33:55.830 --> 33:56.830
Good night.

33:57.097 --> 33:58.993
Good night.

34:04.672 --> 34:05.772
Thanks.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.273
<i>Gracias.</i>

34:07.341 --> 34:09.375
Sit.

34:21.188 --> 34:22.621
What's your name?

34:25.225 --> 34:27.092
Mando.

34:27.161 --> 34:29.563
I'm Gina.

34:32.699 --> 34:34.868
Who else is here?

34:35.469 --> 34:36.386
_____

34:36.521 --> 34:37.516
_____

34:37.621 --> 34:38.652
_____

34:38.790 --> 34:40.623
_____

34:43.377 --> 34:44.681
_____

35:16.577 --> 35:17.811
Well, hello.

35:22.416 --> 35:24.417
Guess.

35:27.588 --> 35:34.060
You dickhead.
It's Charlotte. Uh...

35:34.128 --> 35:36.062
Just, uh...

35:36.130 --> 35:38.331
drinking wine...

35:38.398 --> 35:42.468
thinking about that night
on the skiff...

35:42.536 --> 35:45.411
you, me, Bartles & Jaymes.

35:49.777 --> 35:52.847
_____

35:53.229 --> 35:56.238
_____

35:56.949 --> 35:57.558
_____

35:58.760 --> 35:59.783
_____

36:00.688 --> 36:01.825
_____

36:01.981 --> 36:02.753
_____

36:03.924 --> 36:05.021
_____

36:11.181 --> 36:12.944
Es...? Esme!

36:49.303 --> 36:50.737
Good night.

36:50.805 --> 36:52.806
Yeah, good night.

36:57.144 --> 36:58.907
Who did those drawings?

37:00.814 --> 37:02.680
Jim Dobbs.

37:04.451 --> 37:07.553
It looks like
they were made by a child.

37:07.621 --> 37:09.555
He's not a child.

37:09.623 --> 37:12.025
He's brain-damaged.

37:14.528 --> 37:16.562
How do you know him?

37:31.145 --> 37:33.980
He killed my sister.

37:41.756 --> 37:44.423
When did she die?

37:44.491 --> 37:47.127
When I was 15.

37:47.194 --> 37:48.883
So young.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.326
She was 18.

37:50.464 --> 37:53.390
- Waitress at a truck stop.
- Yeah?

37:55.335 --> 37:58.772
Oh, there's lots of...
violence off the highways

37:58.839 --> 38:01.241
and rest stops and such.

38:08.015 --> 38:12.418
Was it a violent death?

38:38.813 --> 38:42.715
I'm sure you miss her
very much.

38:42.783 --> 38:45.218
Sometimes.

38:49.890 --> 38:52.258
But she's gone.

39:06.889 --> 39:08.477
What was he going to do?

39:08.775 --> 39:10.142
Kidnap you.

39:10.210 --> 39:12.177
What?

39:12.245 --> 39:14.287
Throw you in the trunk,
drive you somewhere,

39:14.360 --> 39:16.014
call your parents for money.

39:16.116 --> 39:17.249
Are you kidding?

39:17.318 --> 39:19.151
No. They do that here.

39:20.086 --> 39:21.927
What's that?

39:22.489 --> 39:24.892
Eight girls were found.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.328
Dead?

39:28.395 --> 39:31.263
Yeah, dead.

39:31.332 --> 39:33.666
He got them.

39:33.734 --> 39:35.519
Who?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.385
<i>La Bestia.</i>

39:37.705 --> 39:39.323
The Beast.

39:40.741 --> 39:42.342
That's what we call him.

39:42.409 --> 39:45.715
The one who's killing
all the girls.

39:46.780 --> 39:49.048
Is it one person?

39:49.115 --> 39:54.587
One, two, a hundred...
No one knows.

39:54.655 --> 39:58.290
So, he's just... the Beast.

40:33.928 --> 40:35.769
_____

40:35.892 --> 40:37.617
_____

40:38.499 --> 40:40.133
Now tell us what you saw.

40:40.301 --> 40:41.154
_____

40:41.302 --> 40:43.397
Excuse me.
Please, tell us what you saw.

40:46.522 --> 40:49.594
_____

40:50.058 --> 40:51.799
_____

40:51.929 --> 40:53.232
She couldn't see his face.

40:53.270 --> 40:54.786
Uh-huh.

40:54.985 --> 40:57.539
_____

40:58.519 --> 40:59.501
_____

40:59.999 --> 41:03.912
_____

41:04.127 --> 41:06.520
_____

41:07.848 --> 41:09.165
_____

41:10.004 --> 41:10.809
_____

41:14.701 --> 41:18.170
She says, uh,
it was like a police car.

41:18.238 --> 41:20.673
Maybe he's one of us.

41:36.205 --> 41:38.493
Don't your parents
wonder where you are?

41:39.797 --> 41:41.065
No.

41:41.100 --> 41:43.582
Why not?

41:44.898 --> 41:46.298
My dad's obsessed

41:46.366 --> 41:49.368
with his bitchy girlfriend
and her fake tits.

41:50.260 --> 41:51.985
And your mom?

41:53.273 --> 41:55.469
Just, uh...

41:57.260 --> 41:59.023
messed up.

42:01.747 --> 42:03.712
Here, take these.

42:04.678 --> 42:06.179
Thanks.

42:07.654 --> 42:09.885
I guess I'm going.

42:11.884 --> 42:14.178
Don't come back, okay.

42:14.260 --> 42:16.958
You could turn
into a pink cross.

42:18.732 --> 42:22.429
Yeah. Okay.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.637
My sister's one of 'em.

42:30.410 --> 42:32.490
She got killed?

42:33.446 --> 42:35.515
Disappeared.

42:35.649 --> 42:38.732
Took the bus to her factory job,

42:39.320 --> 42:41.723
never come back.

42:43.969 --> 42:45.908
Gosh.

42:46.292 --> 42:48.293
Yeah.

42:51.297 --> 42:53.298
Keep the change.

42:57.304 --> 42:58.737
You came.

42:58.805 --> 43:00.672
You call, I come.

43:00.740 --> 43:02.308
If you know what I mean.

43:04.110 --> 43:05.704
Oh.

43:08.481 --> 43:10.249
Pilates?

43:10.317 --> 43:11.683
Yes.

43:11.751 --> 43:12.977
Nice.

43:14.287 --> 43:16.188
Look at you... all hot widow.

43:16.256 --> 43:18.390
You're smokin', baby.

43:18.458 --> 43:19.558
How's Tampa?

43:19.625 --> 43:21.991
Buggy. Moist.

43:23.478 --> 43:25.417
Is this your spread?

43:25.552 --> 43:27.399
The whole damn thing.

43:28.668 --> 43:30.707
You did good.

43:31.537 --> 43:32.905
Now...

43:32.973 --> 43:35.674
let's have a few drinks,
and I'll show you my new tattoo.

43:41.214 --> 43:43.582
Hey, Cooper.
This for us?

43:43.649 --> 43:44.955
Yes, ma'am.

43:45.028 --> 43:46.792
I'd keep that on.

43:46.908 --> 43:50.285
FBI sent Gedman
to the head shrinker.

43:53.038 --> 43:54.393
Did they redact
the doctor's name?

43:54.460 --> 43:56.828
No, ma'am.
Peter Meadows.

43:56.897 --> 43:59.331
Let's go see him.

44:55.755 --> 44:58.413
Oh... oh...

45:11.838 --> 45:14.557
_____

45:24.494 --> 45:26.147
Did you call in the unit?

45:26.282 --> 45:27.715
No.

45:59.519 --> 46:01.663
Show me your hands!

46:09.830 --> 46:11.885
Show me your hands.

46:31.443 --> 46:32.724
Ready?

46:33.637 --> 46:35.528
Police!

46:36.507 --> 46:37.946
Are you hurt?

46:38.303 --> 46:40.414
You're safe now.

46:40.802 --> 46:42.469
You.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.782
I saw him.

46:47.206 --> 46:49.415
I saw the Beast.
