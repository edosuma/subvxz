your new positive attitude

08:03.348 --> 08:05.883

you once described as

08:05.884 --> 08:07.351
"America's stinky butt."

08:07.352 --> 08:08.902
But then, after we met
the marshal,

08:08.937 --> 08:10.187
you said something very strange.

08:10.188 --> 08:11.739
It was "squirt-anly," wasn't it?

08:11.740 --> 08:13.357
No, something much stranger.

08:13.358 --> 08:16.727
[slowed audio] You were right.

08:16.728 --> 08:18.779
I knew then that you
were up to something,

08:18.780 --> 08:19.997
so I followed you here.

08:19.998 --> 08:21.949
I guessed the combination
on the first try:

08:21.950 --> 08:24.034

- My mom's birthday.

- No.
- The moon landing.

- Nope.
- Fine, you're right.

follow orders?

08:42.804 --> 08:44.221

this stupid place,

08:44.222 --> 08:45.556

is that its mayors keep dying,

08:47.559 --> 08:48.559

09:56.094 --> 09:57.344

Wrong, Mr. Fart.
He was a jerk and he sucked.

10:00.599 --> 10:02.466

10:02.467 --> 10:04.668

15:08.131 --> 15:09.882
How did the snake removal go?

15:09.883 --> 15:11.967
Eeeee!

15:11.968 --> 15:14.283
It was good. It was good.

15:16.556 --> 15:18.174
[raps door]

15:18.175 --> 15:20.509
Ms. Karfton,
you don't know us, but...

15:20.510 --> 15:21.894
Uh, yeah, I do.

15:21.895 --> 15:24.680
I got you on video looking
like a couple of dumbasses.

15:24.681 --> 15:25.681
[chuckles]

15:25.682 --> 15:26.766
I like to think I handled it

15:26.767 --> 15:28.067
with some amount of grace.

15:28.068 --> 15:29.902
Nope, you looked dumber
than my kid Jaden,

15:29.903 --> 15:31.687
and his eyes are perma-crossed.

15:31.688 --> 15:33.339
You want to see? Hey, Jaden!

15:33.340 --> 15:35.073
No, that's not necessary.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.108
Have you posted
that video to the Internet?

15:37.160 --> 15:38.244
Not yet.

15:38.245 --> 15:39.528
Ran out of data on my phone

15:39.529 --> 15:40.852
because of all the porn
I watched.

15:40.864 --> 15:42.148
We don't know each other.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.549
You could've just said you
were out of data.

15:43.550 --> 15:44.917
I'm uploading the video tomorrow

15:44.918 --> 15:46.001
at my cousin's wedding.

15:46.002 --> 15:47.586
Dog track has free Wi-Fi.

15:47.587 --> 15:49.588
Would you ever consider
not uploading it

15:49.589 --> 15:50.623
and deleting it instead?

15:50.624 --> 15:51.924
If our boss sees that video,

15:51.925 --> 15:52.958
we could be fired.

15:52.959 --> 15:54.293
I don't care about you.

15:54.294 --> 15:55.795
A great viral video like that

15:55.796 --> 15:57.797
could fetch me ten grand.

15:57.798 --> 16:00.549
And do you know what type
of tanning bed I could get

16:00.550 --> 16:03.135
for that kind of money?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.437
A mid-range one.

16:04.438 --> 16:06.722
Not necessary.
Your tan is great as-is.

16:06.723 --> 16:08.641
You look like...

16:08.642 --> 16:10.059
an evenly-stained deck.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.527
All right, dude.
Keep it in your pants.

16:11.528 --> 16:13.946
Like, I get why
you're into this,

16:13.947 --> 16:16.781
and I could see something
going on with us later,

16:16.817 --> 16:18.733
but right now, I need the cash.

16:18.785 --> 16:20.953
Wait, what if we gave you
the $10,000?

16:20.954 --> 16:23.621
Make it 15, you got a deal.

16:23.657 --> 16:25.458
[sighs] Fine.

16:25.459 --> 16:28.494
Meet us tonight at
the Fun Zone... 8:00.

16:28.495 --> 16:29.545
I will.

16:29.546 --> 16:31.463
Wear something cute.

16:34.718 --> 16:36.051
We don't have
that kind of money.

16:36.052 --> 16:37.052
Don't worry.

16:37.053 --> 16:39.305
I still have a few
tricks up my sleeve.

16:39.306 --> 16:40.840
The only thing
I need you to do is...

16:40.841 --> 16:42.007
I'm not gonna
show you my tattoo.

16:42.008 --> 16:43.175
Come on, just give me a hint.

16:43.176 --> 16:44.410
Is it an antique boat?

16:44.411 --> 16:47.430
Is it a musket?
Is it me on a dragon?

16:47.431 --> 16:49.899
Sir, is it me on a dragon?

16:49.900 --> 16:52.935
Boom. $15,000 cash.

16:52.936 --> 16:54.769
Wow. How'd you get it?

16:54.821 --> 16:56.205
Oh, you didn't.

16:56.206 --> 16:57.823
You just stuck a few 20s

16:57.824 --> 16:59.492
around a bunch
of corn dog coupons.

16:59.493 --> 17:00.693
Smart, right?

17:00.694 --> 17:01.894
What if she decides to count it?

17:01.895 --> 17:03.078
Oh, I'm not too
worried about that.

17:03.079 --> 17:04.662
She doesn't strike me
as a big counter.

17:04.698 --> 17:05.865
Oh, well, that's
quite an assumption.

17:05.866 --> 17:08.083
So... so this is your big plan.

17:08.084 --> 17:09.702
Oh, we need to call this off.

17:09.703 --> 17:11.787
No, this is our best shot.

17:11.788 --> 17:13.705
And right now,
it's our only shot.

17:13.707 --> 17:15.374
Where's my money, bitch?

17:15.375 --> 17:17.509
Charming.
I see you brought friends.

17:17.544 --> 17:18.676
Oh, yeah, for backup.

17:18.678 --> 17:21.096
Well, here is your money.

17:21.097 --> 17:24.133
It's all there if you
want to count it.

17:24.134 --> 17:25.718
Hey, I graduated high school.

17:25.719 --> 17:27.852
I don't have to prove to you
I can count.

17:27.887 --> 17:29.221
Of course not.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.689
Of course not.

17:30.690 --> 17:32.691
Here's the phone.
You can delete the video.

17:32.692 --> 17:34.827
- Thank you... pictures...
- Hey, Billy, check it out.

17:34.828 --> 17:37.279
I'ma stick $1,000
out of my zipper.

17:37.280 --> 17:39.815
Hey, what the hell?

17:39.816 --> 17:42.034
This isn't real money.

17:42.035 --> 17:43.201
Hey, give me my phone.

17:43.236 --> 17:44.620
You're gonna have
to catch me first.

17:44.621 --> 17:45.905
Argh!

17:45.906 --> 17:49.909
[laughing] You really
thought that would work?

17:49.910 --> 17:52.661
This video is going viral.

17:52.662 --> 17:55.164
And you...

17:55.165 --> 17:57.066
this can still happen anytime.

17:57.067 --> 17:58.750
You know where I live.

18:01.304 --> 18:02.638
You okay?

18:02.639 --> 18:04.924
[grunts] Yeah.

18:04.925 --> 18:06.174
- A little sore, but...
- Good.

18:06.226 --> 18:07.760
Then I can excoriate you freely.

18:07.761 --> 18:09.458
You half-assed living
in Florida,

18:09.479 --> 18:11.096
and you half-assed
getting the phone back.

18:11.097 --> 18:12.681
You've probably blown our cover,

18:12.682 --> 18:14.767
which means the marshals
will have to move us.

18:14.768 --> 18:16.569
And when they do,
I'm gonna demand

18:16.570 --> 18:18.020
they send us to
different cities,

18:18.021 --> 18:20.439
because I don't want you
anywhere near me.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.856
I swapped the phones.

18:21.908 --> 18:22.908
What?

18:22.909 --> 18:25.661
I got the video.

18:25.662 --> 18:26.695
Sorry.

18:26.696 --> 18:28.496
I won't bother you anymore.

18:28.532 --> 18:29.864
Bye, Greg.

18:34.118 --> 18:36.290
Lastly, hole 13
on the mini golf course

18:36.291 --> 18:38.376
is missing, so tell
all the players

18:38.377 --> 18:40.461
to just repeat hole 12.

18:40.462 --> 18:41.796
All right, dismissed.

18:41.797 --> 18:43.881
Damn, Greg, you are killing it

18:43.882 --> 18:45.231
as assistant manager.

18:45.267 --> 18:47.218
I mean, having the idea
to have people come in

18:47.219 --> 18:49.719
at 9:00 a.m....that has
really helped business.

18:49.721 --> 18:51.772
Yes, that is when the sign
says we're open.

18:51.773 --> 18:53.391
Yeah.
Look, there's one other thing.

18:53.392 --> 18:55.443
Now that you're management,
I need you to promise me

18:55.444 --> 18:57.110
that you're gonna
lay off the drugs.

18:57.145 --> 18:58.896
Just a little... I don't want
to kill your whole

18:58.897 --> 19:02.566
stoney vibe or anything.

19:02.567 --> 19:04.068
- I'll try.
- Thank you.

19:04.069 --> 19:05.903
You keep this up,

19:05.904 --> 19:08.289
and I genuinely believe
that you could be night manager

19:08.290 --> 19:10.140
in, like, two to three years.

19:10.175 --> 19:11.959
Yes.

19:11.960 --> 19:14.962
Two or three years.

19:14.963 --> 19:16.797
Here.

19:16.798 --> 19:19.249
In Florida.

19:19.251 --> 19:20.634
Well, it's an all-terrain
vehicle,

19:20.635 --> 19:22.303
so yeah, you can do doughnuts

19:22.304 --> 19:23.504
in your living room.

19:23.505 --> 19:25.056
Hi, I hear you're
the man to talk to

19:25.057 --> 19:30.344
about the XTR-XP 49789WJ8-09
Xtreme four-wheel drive Z-Cat.

19:30.345 --> 19:31.512
Sir, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

19:31.513 --> 19:32.646
I think you might
be more comfortable

19:32.647 --> 19:34.181
speaking with one of
our other associates.

19:34.182 --> 19:36.267
No, no, I need to talk
to this particular associate

19:36.268 --> 19:38.819
and apologize for saying he

19:38.820 --> 19:41.355
half-assed his ATV
sales technique.

19:41.356 --> 19:43.491
Well, that's very nice,
but I've moved on,

19:43.492 --> 19:44.575
and I'm with customers,

19:44.576 --> 19:45.860
so thanks.

19:45.861 --> 19:47.194
These machines are death traps.

19:47.195 --> 19:48.646
If you purchase one,

19:48.647 --> 19:50.331
you will be maimed.

19:50.332 --> 19:51.748
[laughs] You won't be maimed.

19:51.783 --> 19:53.284
Most of the injuries
are internal.

19:53.285 --> 19:54.535
You know what?

19:54.536 --> 19:55.786
I'm gonna speak with this
gentleman for one moment.

19:55.787 --> 19:57.171
I'm so sorry.
Give me a second.

19:57.172 --> 19:59.623
Sir, can I speak with you
over here?

19:59.624 --> 20:01.124
[whispering]
What is this all about?

20:01.176 --> 20:02.943
I've been staying away from you;
I got a job.

20:02.944 --> 20:04.562
I'm trying to make the best
of it, just like you said.

20:04.563 --> 20:06.714
Well, don't bother.
Making the best of it sucks.

20:06.715 --> 20:08.215
I want to go home.

20:08.216 --> 20:09.967
This town is a crap circus.

20:09.968 --> 20:11.135
What has gotten into you?

20:11.136 --> 20:12.803
You clearly got the promotion
like you wanted.

20:12.804 --> 20:13.888
Congratulations, by the way.

20:13.889 --> 20:14.939
The blue looks great on you.

20:14.940 --> 20:16.307
The day we spent
acting like cops

20:16.308 --> 20:17.475
and getting that video back

20:17.476 --> 20:19.226
was the only time
I've felt alive

20:19.227 --> 20:20.478
since we've been down here.

20:20.479 --> 20:22.613
So what are you saying?

20:22.614 --> 20:24.281
Can I take this
for a test drive?

20:24.282 --> 20:26.484
Yeah, sure.

20:26.485 --> 20:28.035
[clears throat]
The ignition is here.

20:28.036 --> 20:30.121
I've ridden ATVs before...

20:30.122 --> 20:33.624
antiquing in the Berkshires.

20:33.625 --> 20:34.792
[engine revving]

20:34.793 --> 20:36.793
[tires squealing]

20:42.000 --> 20:43.501
Oh, my files.

20:43.502 --> 20:45.336
My beautiful files.

20:45.337 --> 20:47.003
I've looked over
what you've got.

20:47.055 --> 20:49.423
Given your resources,
very impressive, but...

20:49.424 --> 20:50.574
I know.

20:50.575 --> 20:51.809
It'll take me months
to find Figgis,

20:51.810 --> 20:53.610
but we'll find him faster
if we work together.

20:53.612 --> 20:54.979
What if we don't find Figgis?

20:54.980 --> 20:57.648
What if Figgis finds us?

20:57.649 --> 20:59.316
But I thought you
deleted the file.

20:59.317 --> 21:00.367
I was going to,

21:00.368 --> 21:01.836
but this camera phone camera

21:01.837 --> 21:03.404
is not the same kind
of camera phone camera

21:03.405 --> 21:05.790
as I have, so I couldn't
figure out how.

21:05.791 --> 21:06.907
But I'm glad I didn't.

21:06.908 --> 21:08.843
I say we post this video

21:08.844 --> 21:11.045
and use it to lure
Figgis down here,

21:11.046 --> 21:13.163
making ourselves into bait.

21:13.215 --> 21:15.299
And once Figgis is here,
we take him down,

21:15.300 --> 21:17.918
climb out of America's steaming
orifice, and go home.

21:17.919 --> 21:19.637
I like the way you're
thinking, Greg.

21:19.638 --> 21:21.472
It's Holt.

21:21.473 --> 21:23.590
Captain Raymond Holt.

21:23.625 --> 21:24.842
[sighs]

21:24.843 --> 21:27.490
Now come and get us, Figgis.
