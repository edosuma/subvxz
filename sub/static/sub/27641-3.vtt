WEBVTT

00:02.196 --> 00:04.740
This programme contains strong
language and adult humour.

00:04.740 --> 00:07.716
Aw!What?I miss the neck brace.
It was like a powerful turtleneck.

00:07.716 --> 00:10.356
You looked like Robert Redford in
The Way We Were.

00:10.356 --> 00:13.236
Well, should I...get a cravat?

00:13.236 --> 00:15.780
Well, you can't just go
from brace to nothing!

00:15.780 --> 00:18.660
THEY LAUGH
So, all good?

00:18.660 --> 00:22.236
Yeah. Got the all-clear.
Got the clean, full bill of health.

00:22.236 --> 00:26.980
She even said that my weight loss
has made my penis look bigger.

00:26.980 --> 00:29.076
Did you tell her about
the bed sweats?

00:29.076 --> 00:31.716
Yeah. She wasn't worried about that.
Really?

00:31.716 --> 00:34.476
Did you tell her how it soaks
the whole bed now?

00:34.476 --> 00:36.516
Did she not think
that's weird and gross?

00:36.516 --> 00:39.516
She didn't use those words.
Did you show her the brown thing

00:39.516 --> 00:41.916
that just grew on your leg?
First of all, it's beige,

00:41.916 --> 00:44.916
and, er... Does it bother you
that I've been declared healthy?

00:44.916 --> 00:50.020
No, it doesn't bother me.
It's great. It's just interesting

00:50.020 --> 00:53.436
that you can spend 40 years
inhaling sausage rolls

00:53.436 --> 00:55.620
and get rewarded with
a clean bill of health.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.460
Good for you.
You should get a check-up.

00:59.460 --> 01:02.436
I'm fine.Oh, are you, now?
I mean, you LOOK fine,

01:02.436 --> 01:06.180
but could be a mess in there.
HE LAUGHS

01:06.180 --> 01:08.796
What are you laughing at?
I'm just thinking, you know,

01:08.796 --> 01:11.556
one day each of us is gonna go
to the doctor and be told,

01:11.556 --> 01:15.996
"I have extremely bad news."
Jesus Christ!

01:15.996 --> 01:19.620
You know, I think
I'm gonna train for a ten-K.

01:19.620 --> 01:22.020
Do you wanna join me?
No.

01:22.020 --> 01:25.116
Why?
Because you fart when you run.

01:25.116 --> 01:27.996
Well, if you ran faster, you wouldn't
have to huff 'em, slowpoke.

01:27.996 --> 01:30.876
"Slowpoke"? Oh, my God!

01:30.876 --> 01:33.876
I totally run faster than you.

01:33.876 --> 01:38.196
No, you don't.

01:38.196 --> 01:41.196
This is ridiculous!

01:41.196 --> 01:44.676
It's just silly. I'm wearing heels.

01:44.676 --> 01:50.340
And carrying a bag.
I wasn't even trying.

01:50.340 --> 01:58.356
Now I'm trying!

01:58.356 --> 02:01.116
I had no idea I was so healthy.
I'm thinking about competing

02:01.116 --> 02:04.116
in a Masters Tournament.
I don't think you qualify for those

02:04.116 --> 02:07.620
just by being old. I think you also
have to be good at a sport.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.996
Well, their loss.

02:09.996 --> 02:12.756
I had the full check-up myself
a few weeks back.

02:12.756 --> 02:15.036
Tanya wants to start trying
for a baby.

02:15.036 --> 02:17.676
I figured if I do it right now,
immediately,

02:17.676 --> 02:20.316
there's probably just enough time
for me to watch it grow up

02:20.316 --> 02:23.940
before I run out of steam. According
   to my haircuts, I'm fucked.

02:23.940 --> 02:27.516
Wow! Why would you do that?
Because she wants a baby.

02:27.516 --> 02:30.036
I already tried to tell her to do it
     with somebody younger,

02:30.036 --> 02:33.060
but she likes me. And, you know,
she's got a good career,

02:33.060 --> 02:36.156
and her folks have money, so,
you know, if I get Alzheimer's

02:36.156 --> 02:40.356
or assassinated, her and the wee one
     should be all set.Mm.

02:40.356 --> 02:42.876
You've really thought this through.
Plus, Tanya's on board

02:42.876 --> 02:45.540
for all my sexual proclivities,
and that is not a given

02:45.540 --> 02:48.276
for every woman I meet.
Huh! Tell me about it!

02:48.276 --> 02:50.500
Dave and I'll start a prayer circle
for you.

02:50.500 --> 02:52.596
No, no. I support older dads.

02:52.596 --> 02:55.476
I mean, I'm in my late 40s.
I've just had a baby.

02:55.476 --> 02:58.180
Um, I know I'm not as old as you,
but -

02:58.180 --> 03:01.236
I'm the same age as you are, son.

03:01.236 --> 03:03.780
Really?!

03:03.780 --> 03:06.036
Oh! Hey, that reminds me.

03:06.036 --> 03:10.020
Got something to show you.

03:10.020 --> 03:13.236
Is that what we're eating right now?
BOTH LAUGH

03:13.236 --> 03:17.700
That is Mr Barnaby Honeypot,
Daphne's new pony.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.916
Did you ride it here?
Is it tied to a post out front?

03:20.916 --> 03:23.940
No! It's on our farm!

03:23.940 --> 03:27.780
Oh! We bought a farm...in Kent.
Yeah.

03:27.780 --> 03:30.396
I bought it because I don't want
Daphne getting stabbed to death

03:30.396 --> 03:34.020
in London. Huh! I'm such a dad now!
HE LAUGHS

03:34.020 --> 03:36.636
Actually,
we're going down this weekend.

03:36.636 --> 03:39.636
You guys wanna come?
You can bring the kids.Fuck, yeah.

03:39.636 --> 03:42.396
I can't this weekend. Tanya and I
are taking some mushrooms

03:42.396 --> 03:45.636
and going to a Renaissance fair
in Norfolk.

03:45.636 --> 03:48.100
What?

03:48.100 --> 03:50.676
I mean, I feel pretty healthy.
I feel good,

03:50.676 --> 03:52.900
except for the peeing myself thing.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.356
It used to just happen
when I was trampolining,

03:55.356 --> 03:59.460
and now it's just...whenever.
As needed.

03:59.460 --> 04:02.076
Is there anything we could do
about that?God, no.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.116
We're probably closer to
curing cancer

04:04.116 --> 04:07.356
than figuring out how
the hell mothers not pee
when they don't want to.Oh.

04:07.356 --> 04:09.636
So, we've got your tests back.

04:09.636 --> 04:13.060
I'm afraid your cholesterol level
is quite high for a woman your age.

04:13.060 --> 04:15.876
Are you sure?
My cholesterol feels fine.

04:15.876 --> 04:18.036
Also, your bloods are indicating
a high level of fat

04:18.036 --> 04:21.396
around your organs,
and, I have to say,

04:21.396 --> 04:24.156
your mobility isn't great.
What? What does that mean?

04:24.156 --> 04:26.556
Er, you couldn't touch your toes
earlier.

04:26.556 --> 04:29.700
Some people just can't do that.
It's like wiggling your ears

04:29.700 --> 04:31.780
or moon-walking.
But the good news is,

04:31.780 --> 04:34.836
your weight is within the healthy
limit for your age and height.

04:34.836 --> 04:38.500
So the package is the right size,
but what's inside is just shit?

04:38.500 --> 04:40.740
No.You're saying if you took
a normal-size mannequin

04:40.740 --> 04:44.916
and filled it with meatballs
and margarine, that'd be me?

04:44.916 --> 04:48.276
That's not what I'm saying.
Medically that's what you're saying.

04:48.276 --> 04:51.396
Fine.

04:51.396 --> 04:56.580
I just never thought of myself
as unhealthy before. I'm a runner.

04:56.580 --> 04:58.660
How are you a runner?
KNOCK AT DOOR

04:58.660 --> 05:02.676
I used to run cross-country at uni.
Yeah. I used to build pillow forts.

05:02.676 --> 05:04.956
It doesn't mean
I'm currently an architect.

05:04.956 --> 05:07.596
Yeah, but...muscle memory!

05:07.596 --> 05:10.356
Hey!
Are you going raving?

05:10.356 --> 05:12.996
No, running.What, I'm baby-sitting
so you can go running?

05:12.996 --> 05:15.300
Yeah.
Fair enough.

05:15.300 --> 05:18.396
You know, you should be careful.
My uncle Kevin started running

05:18.396 --> 05:22.116
when he was your age - like,
60 or whatever. He did one run

05:22.116 --> 05:25.236
and collapsed and died.
Well, that's unlikely to happen.

05:25.236 --> 05:28.356
Older people are better off standing
 still. You get to a certain age

05:28.356 --> 05:30.756
and you start exercising,
you shake bad stuff loose

05:30.756 --> 05:32.916
and it gets in your bloodstream
and it poisons ya,

05:32.916 --> 05:35.316
and you just drop dead
straight away.

05:35.316 --> 05:42.156
OK. See you about half seven, Anna.
Thank you.

05:42.156 --> 05:46.236
How far was that?
Er, 2.3 miles.

05:46.236 --> 05:50.196
What? Miles? Well, bloody hell!

05:50.196 --> 05:52.260
That's good.

05:52.260 --> 05:56.196
We'll get a Tube back, though,
right?Oh, yeah.

05:56.196 --> 06:00.580
ENGINE ROARS
So fuckin' dangerous.

06:00.580 --> 06:04.116
What if a kid ran out?
Tell him to slow down.

06:04.116 --> 06:07.140
Slow down.

06:07.140 --> 06:09.220
Argh! Oh!

06:09.220 --> 06:11.940
Agh!What just happened?
Oh, God, my eyes!

06:11.940 --> 06:14.916
Agh! Oh, my God, it's acid!
What?!

06:14.916 --> 06:17.436
Rob!
Argh!Rob!

06:17.436 --> 06:20.316
Oh, wait. It tastes like juice.

06:20.316 --> 06:23.316
It... No, it's just juice.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.756
Argh!

06:24.756 --> 06:28.740
Oh!
Bloody hell!

06:28.740 --> 06:31.596
That was a bit dramatic!
Oh, really?!

06:31.596 --> 06:37.716
Well, you didn't just have
acidic juice shot in your face.

06:37.716 --> 06:44.796
Fuckin' heck!

06:44.796 --> 06:47.676
Do you wanna start running with me?
Not really. Why?

06:47.676 --> 06:50.820
Because I've got fatty organs,
and Rob won't run with me anymore

06:50.820 --> 06:53.556
because he's scared of London.
I don't wanna join a gym

06:53.556 --> 06:56.196
because of the mirrors.
And the people."Oh, and the smell."

06:56.196 --> 06:58.596
It's like every breath you take
has wiggled its way

06:58.596 --> 07:00.636
through 20 pairs of sweaty buttocks.

07:00.636 --> 07:03.940
Do you want to come to military
fitness in the park with me?

07:03.940 --> 07:07.476
Yeah, sure. How do I do that? Do I -
PHONE BEEPS

07:07.476 --> 07:11.436
Fran, I'll call you back, OK?

07:11.436 --> 07:14.620
What's up? Are you all right?I'm
just calling to check that you're OK.

07:14.620 --> 07:17.556
Have you seen the news?"No. Why?"
There was an incident in town.

07:17.556 --> 07:20.700
A guy drove a car into a crowd
of people in front of the M&M store.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.036
No, that was me. I wanted some M&Ms
and I forgot my purse.

07:24.036 --> 07:28.356
Honey, a guy died, OK? There was
a stampede. It's very upsetting!

07:28.356 --> 07:31.836
I tell you what's upsetting, is
you thought I was at the M&M store.

07:31.836 --> 07:34.476
All right. Well, just stay away from
that whole area.

07:34.476 --> 08:01.716
What about Kinder Egg Village?
Can I go there?

08:01.716 --> 08:03.756
SHE GASPS

08:03.756 --> 08:08.380
HE UNZIPS
SHE GASPS

08:08.380 --> 08:15.756
BOTH GRUNT

08:15.756 --> 08:22.836
Fuck! No!
HE PANTS

08:22.836 --> 08:25.660
BOTH GRUNT AND MOAN

08:25.660 --> 08:33.636
Aah!
SHE MOANS / GASPS

08:33.636 --> 08:44.436
HE GRUNTS / BREATHES HEAVILY

08:44.436 --> 08:47.436
Same time next week.
See you then.

08:47.436 --> 08:50.196
Goodbye, Douglas.

08:50.196 --> 09:14.992
Don't say my name.

09:14.992 --> 09:17.992
Welcome to paradise!

09:17.992 --> 09:19.736
HE LAUGHS

09:19.736 --> 09:21.712
Wow!

09:21.712 --> 09:23.992
HE LAUGHS
Mwah!

09:23.992 --> 09:26.392
Through here we have
the kitchen garden.

09:26.392 --> 09:30.592
Every vegetable you could ever need
- er, carrots, baby carrots,

09:30.592 --> 09:32.632
purple carrots...
Cool!

09:32.632 --> 09:37.336
And this is what sealed the deal
when we were viewing the place.

09:37.336 --> 09:40.912
A sewer?
No, man!

09:40.912 --> 09:47.096
It's a bunker!

09:47.096 --> 09:50.152
You wanna get in?
Oh, no. I try never to go in holes.

09:50.152 --> 09:53.392
Caves, holes, tubes...
Not really my scene.

09:53.392 --> 09:56.536
You might wanna think about it, with
the state of the world these days.

09:56.536 --> 10:01.792
I mean, if you have a family,
you really should have a bunker.

10:01.792 --> 10:04.432
It's something to consider.
SHE LAUGHS

10:04.432 --> 10:06.776
We're not getting a bunker!

10:06.776 --> 10:09.232
BABY GURGLES

10:09.232 --> 10:12.856
So, do you have Daphne strapped
to you all the time?Sure.

10:12.856 --> 10:15.112
How do you shower?
Oh, I have a waterproof one.

10:15.112 --> 10:17.176
SHE LAUGHS

10:17.176 --> 10:20.696
Dave's a very involved parent.
There's not much for me to do,

10:20.696 --> 10:23.632
outside of flopping out the odd tit.

10:23.632 --> 10:26.752
Hey, it is a pleasure
and a privilege.

10:26.752 --> 10:30.832
Oh, I love being a dad! It is the
highest high of all. Am I right?

10:30.832 --> 10:33.112
I dunno. I feel like having kids

10:33.112 --> 10:36.376
is like strapping yourself
to a Formula 1 race car. Boom!

10:36.376 --> 10:38.512
Your life is over.
But not in a bad way.

10:38.512 --> 10:40.912
Yeah. You just have to take
everything you ever wanted

10:40.912 --> 10:45.352
and put it in a box,
because you never...

10:45.352 --> 10:49.016
But, yeah. It's great, you know?

10:49.016 --> 10:52.216
So, you think this could become
a permanent move?Oh, yeah.No.

10:52.216 --> 10:54.832
Nn-nn.

10:54.832 --> 10:59.032
Well, I dunno. I dunno if I want
Daphne growing up in London.

10:59.032 --> 11:01.552
You slip on a banana peel there,
go to the emergency room,

11:01.552 --> 11:03.592
it takes you six hours to get seen

11:03.592 --> 11:06.952
because of all the knife victims
bleeding out all over the floors.

11:06.952 --> 11:10.456
Everyone at this table, including
you, knows that's not true.

11:10.456 --> 11:13.192
I dunno.
I mean, when I was attacked...

11:13.192 --> 11:16.552
With juice.
..with what we now know was juice...

11:16.552 --> 11:18.712
Well, we figured it out pretty fast.

11:18.712 --> 11:21.592
All right.
Well, outside I was screaming,

11:21.592 --> 11:25.672
but inside, I was just, like,
"Oh, right. Now this. Yeah."

11:25.672 --> 11:28.312
It's like there's this
low-level feeling of menace there

11:28.312 --> 11:31.432
that we've all gotten used to,
but that I never really noticed

11:31.432 --> 11:33.712
before the attack.
It was juice!

11:33.712 --> 11:36.856
Look, I don't care if MY face
gets melted, you know?

11:36.856 --> 11:40.432
I'm married.Hang on. I...
I care if your face gets melted.

11:40.432 --> 11:43.096
I have to look at you.
Well, no. All I'm saying is,

11:43.096 --> 11:46.936
I care more if our kids' faces
get melted, you know?

11:46.936 --> 11:51.952
I don't want my kids' faces
to get melted. That's all I'm saying.

11:51.952 --> 11:57.016
Why'd you buy a baby a pony?

11:57.016 --> 11:58.672
What...?

11:58.672 --> 12:04.216
So, Chris and the buxom ingenue
went away for the weekend.

12:04.216 --> 12:07.312
Jeffrey chose to stay with
his friend Toby instead of me,

12:07.312 --> 12:09.656
which I found devastating.
Mm.

12:09.656 --> 12:11.992
So, that's something
you've got to look forward to

12:11.992 --> 12:15.256
when your kids get older, and
they throw you out in the rubbish,

12:15.256 --> 12:18.136
the coffee grounds and fish heads.
He'll come back to you.

12:18.136 --> 12:20.696
It's probably just a phase, right?
Yeah.

12:20.696 --> 12:27.472
Anyway, I've got my volunteer work.
I've got my loom.

12:27.472 --> 12:30.712
And Douglas is keeping me occupied,
texting me.

12:30.712 --> 12:34.072
Like an eager puppy since we started
        that little game.

12:34.072 --> 12:36.856
A puppy
with a throbbing human penis.

12:36.856 --> 12:41.392
Ah, Jesus, Fran! It's all a bit
Apple Tree Yard, isn't it?

12:41.392 --> 12:43.552
No.

12:43.552 --> 12:45.976
The sex is, like...

12:45.976 --> 12:49.192
Everything about him,
I mean physically, is just...

12:49.192 --> 12:52.432
Even his scrotum's attractive.
How can you say that?

12:52.432 --> 12:54.952
The scrotum's a design flaw.

12:54.952 --> 12:57.976
You ask ten women what the worst
thing they saw in their life was,

12:57.976 --> 13:00.592
for eight of them
it'll be scrotum-related.

13:00.592 --> 13:03.352
Well, I like what I like.

13:03.352 --> 13:06.232
I don't follow the herd.
Girls, we like to talk!

13:06.232 --> 13:11.392
Green 12, squat jumps the length of
the cones. Green seven, you can skip.

13:11.392 --> 13:20.272
All right.

13:20.272 --> 13:25.016
Engage your core while you skip.
What?Engage your core.

13:25.016 --> 13:26.992
Yeah.
Flex it!

13:26.992 --> 13:29.272
Tighten it!
I am!

13:29.272 --> 13:32.152
Fucking hell!
Can you make it harder than that?

13:32.152 --> 13:35.392
No!
OK. Green 12, you can start skipping.

13:35.392 --> 13:48.856
Green seven, burpees.

13:48.856 --> 13:50.992
What are you doing?
Why are you taking photos?

13:50.992 --> 14:05.512
For my Facebook page.
Well, hang on. Just let me...

14:05.512 --> 14:08.392
His face was blurry
because he was on a moped,

14:08.392 --> 14:10.792
and, you know,
I had juice in my eyes.

14:10.792 --> 14:14.512
Right.And I don't wanna sound
bigoted, but he was brown.

14:14.512 --> 14:17.816
Er, Mediterranean brown,
not, like, Muslim brown.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.752
Um, I can't say
that he wasn't Muslim,

14:20.752 --> 14:23.512
but I don't care.
That's not my angle.

14:23.512 --> 14:27.352
Um, is there a statute of limitations
for a crime like this?

14:27.352 --> 14:29.816
Well, I'm more comfortable
calling it a prank.

14:29.816 --> 14:32.392
All right. Well,
whatever you wanna file it under.

14:32.392 --> 14:34.792
I think I'm gonna file it
under juice.

14:34.792 --> 14:38.152
It was juice this time. I mean,
I think it could've been a rehearsal,

14:38.152 --> 14:40.376
you know, pre-calculated.

14:40.376 --> 14:43.432
I think it might've been a rehearsal
for a bigger plan.

14:43.432 --> 14:45.656
You know, they did that for 9/11.

14:45.656 --> 14:50.776
Do you work in security?
No. Pharmaceuticals.

14:50.776 --> 14:59.896
HE SLURPS

14:59.896 --> 15:02.992
Hey!

15:02.992 --> 15:05.176
What are you doing?

15:05.176 --> 15:07.312
I just saw one of those guys
from the house next door

15:07.312 --> 15:09.496
that you were worried about.
What guys?

15:09.496 --> 15:11.632
When was I worried about them?

15:11.632 --> 15:14.632
Don't you think there's something up
with them? I mean, who are they?

15:14.632 --> 15:17.176
It's a gang of guys living together.
They're not gay.

15:17.176 --> 15:19.736
How do you know?
I've never seen 'em do one gay thing!

15:19.736 --> 15:23.272
Have you ever seen 'em kiss?
Have they ever seen US kiss?

15:23.272 --> 15:25.912
OK. Here's the thing.
They come and they go.

15:25.912 --> 15:28.552
They have that bright
fluorescent light on all the time.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.616
OK. What do you think they're doing
in there?

15:30.616 --> 15:32.632
I've narrowed it down to
two possibilities.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.936
It's either a weed farm...house,

15:34.936 --> 15:37.312
or they're making weapons.

15:37.312 --> 15:41.632
Oh, my God! You need to stop this.

15:41.632 --> 15:43.912
We have to be vigilant.
I reported my attack today

15:43.912 --> 15:47.032
to the police, and they didn't seem
to take it seriously at all.

15:47.032 --> 15:51.472
No shit.You know, we should think
about something like Dave's setup.

15:51.472 --> 15:54.712
I mean, obviously a bunker's insane,
but maybe a panic room.

15:54.712 --> 15:57.712
Not a full panic room,
but maybe some Kevlar curtains,

15:57.712 --> 16:00.536
and, you know, soundproofing.
Oh, my God!

16:00.536 --> 16:04.912
What?
Jesus, that pisses me off!

16:04.912 --> 16:07.912
Look at the state of me!
You look fine!

16:07.912 --> 16:12.832
Oh, great. Great. Now I can never
trust anything you say ever again.

16:12.832 --> 16:14.872
What the f-...

16:14.872 --> 16:16.696
What's a Baba Yaga?

16:16.696 --> 16:19.312
It's like
a Russian folklore monster.

16:19.312 --> 16:22.072
It's a thing that lives in the woods
and eats kids.

16:22.072 --> 16:25.336
Why were you reading about Baba Yaga?
 I'm not. I'm reading a comment

16:25.336 --> 16:29.152
under a picture of me.
Why am I purple?

16:29.152 --> 16:31.432
Someone put a purple filter on me.

16:31.432 --> 16:36.352
Ah, come on!

16:36.352 --> 16:39.592
THEY LAUGH
Hey, buddy, you're back!

16:39.592 --> 16:41.992
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Jeffrey.

16:41.992 --> 16:45.176
Yo.If you're hungry,
there's halloumi burgers here.

16:45.176 --> 16:49.672
No, thanks.
I've eaten my halloumi for the year.

16:49.672 --> 16:54.352
How was the show? My friend LaVar
saw it. He said it was terrific.

16:54.352 --> 16:57.712
Really?
Well, we had to use two understudies,

16:57.712 --> 17:00.056
and one of them improvised
the entire second act,

17:00.056 --> 17:03.736
and it tanked. So,
who's full of shit - you or LaVar?

17:03.736 --> 17:06.616
Jeffrey!

17:06.616 --> 17:18.952
I'm going to bed.

17:18.952 --> 17:21.232
That was rude!

17:21.232 --> 17:24.376
Look,
I'm sorry things are different.

17:24.376 --> 17:28.072
I'm sorry your mum and I split up,
but we were unhappy,

17:28.072 --> 17:31.432
and we didn't want you
to be around that.I was fine.

17:31.432 --> 17:36.232
And you guys might have been
miserable, but at least you were
miserable in one place - our home.

17:36.232 --> 17:39.592
Now you're just miserable
in two places.I'm not miserable.

17:39.592 --> 17:43.072
You will be, because there's no way
that that is gonna last.

17:43.072 --> 17:45.832
She'll get bored of having
an old-man boyfriend and leave you,

17:45.832 --> 17:48.856
and then you go running back to Mom
and she won't take you back,

17:48.856 --> 17:52.912
then the next thing you know,
you'll be 50, bald, and alone.

17:52.912 --> 17:56.216
I'm gonna be 50 in November.
How am I gonna go bald that fast?

17:56.216 --> 17:59.632
Are you gonna hold me down to shave
my head? I know you're angry,

17:59.632 --> 18:02.632
but I will press charges. Don't you
fucking think that I won't.

18:02.632 --> 18:05.392
THEY LAUGH

18:05.392 --> 18:19.912
Come here.

18:19.912 --> 18:23.632
I think, green ten, if for the rest
of the day you wanna join beginners?

18:23.632 --> 18:28.312
All right? Got a blue bib.
I'm not a beginner at working out.

18:28.312 --> 18:31.736
I'm gonna stay with my friend.
It's not about killing yourself.

18:31.736 --> 18:35.032
It's about doing your best,
working up a sweat, having fun.

18:35.032 --> 18:37.672
I'm not here to have fun.
I'm here to get rid of the fat

18:37.672 --> 18:40.672
around my organs,
and I'm not joining beginners, OK?

18:40.672 --> 18:45.112
That's humiliating.
You puked behind the tree earlier.

18:45.112 --> 18:47.752
Let's just see how you get on
at a lighter pace.

18:47.752 --> 18:53.176
We don't want you
having a heart attack.

18:53.176 --> 18:55.312
Fuck this.

18:55.312 --> 18:56.872
Seriously...

18:56.872 --> 19:01.672
fuck...this pretend-army bullshit.
Let's go, Fran.

19:01.672 --> 19:05.176
I've paid for a block of classes,
so I'll be staying.

19:05.176 --> 19:09.016
And you know what?
You can take down those photos

19:09.016 --> 19:11.272
that you put up of me
on your website,

19:11.272 --> 19:14.152
because I did not agree to those.
You posed for them.Yeah!

19:14.152 --> 19:16.856
Because I didn't know
you'd be using them to humiliate me,

19:16.856 --> 19:20.392
did I? Manipulating them,
putting joke filters on there!

19:20.392 --> 19:25.192
I didn't.Well, somebody put some
sort of purple filter on there, OK?

19:25.192 --> 19:27.472
Like,
"Ha, ha, ha. Look at this idiot,

19:27.472 --> 19:29.656
getting ready to have
a heart attack!"

19:29.656 --> 19:33.656
Look, I know this is tough, OK?
But that's what we're here for.

19:33.656 --> 19:40.432
You can do this. Six weeks ago,
Suzy was in the same shape as you.

19:40.432 --> 19:48.712
Look at her now.

19:48.712 --> 19:52.072
Will you take the photos down?

19:52.072 --> 19:56.272
Will you at least disable comments?

19:56.272 --> 20:15.736
SHE SIGHS

20:15.736 --> 20:17.992
I called my mum yesterday.

20:17.992 --> 20:20.992
She told me two of my aunties died
of heart disease.

20:20.992 --> 20:23.752
Well, you're Irish, so, what -
you have, like, 85 aunts?

20:23.752 --> 20:26.776
If only two of them died of
heart disease, it's pretty good.

20:26.776 --> 20:29.272
Yeah, but what about my dad?
He died young.

20:29.272 --> 20:33.592
Well, honey, he was 70.
70? That's nothing these days.

20:33.592 --> 20:37.336
It's like dying in your 40s.
My parents had me in their 30s.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.336
I had my dad all my adult life.
He knew his grand-kids, sort of.

20:41.336 --> 20:44.872
If I die in my 70s,
my kids will barely be 30.

20:44.872 --> 20:48.832
They won't have had kids.
No way, not millennials.

20:48.832 --> 20:52.216
They don't give a shit about anyone.
Well, you can't think like that.

20:52.216 --> 20:55.312
I mean, maybe Frankie'll get a girl
pregnant when he's 17.

20:55.312 --> 20:57.712
Well, that would be terrible.

20:57.712 --> 21:01.912
Would it? I mean, you'd get to know
your grand-kids longer, so...

21:01.912 --> 21:04.792
I'm just sayin',
nobody knows what's gonna happen.

21:04.792 --> 21:07.576
I just wanna live a decent while.
That's all.

21:07.576 --> 21:10.192
I don't want my heart to pack in.

21:10.192 --> 21:13.432
Your heart's not gonna pack in.
And, if it does,

21:13.432 --> 21:17.512
I'll defibrillate you.
It's not even a big deal these days.

21:17.512 --> 21:19.576
Promise?

21:19.576 --> 21:22.312
SHE CHUCKLES

21:22.312 --> 21:25.792
OK.

21:25.792 --> 21:29.512
Oh, shit! Fuck! I forgot!

21:29.512 --> 21:35.152
I got you something.

21:35.152 --> 21:38.392
Aww!
I miss the neck brace.

21:38.392 --> 21:44.056
Do you like it? Try it on!

21:44.056 --> 21:46.192
SHE LAUGHS
Take it off.

21:46.192 --> 21:49.072
Seriously,
you look like a fisherman simpleton.

21:49.072 --> 21:51.352
Oh!
HE LAUGHS

21:51.352 --> 21:54.136
I look like I'm gonna try and sell
you a home-made Mooncup

21:54.136 --> 21:56.752
out of the back of my Subaru.
SHE LAUGHS

21:56.752 --> 22:00.712
You look like a... You look like
a college poetry teacher

22:00.712 --> 22:02.872
who tells girls he invented
the "Me Too" hashtag.

22:02.872 --> 22:04.552
HE LAUGHS

22:04.552 --> 22:07.912
I look like, er,
one of those Dutch guys, you know?

22:07.912 --> 22:09.976
Who?
Who ride the thing.

22:09.976 --> 22:12.232
No. Which...
You know, they...

22:12.232 --> 22:16.672
Well, I can't think of the, um...
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

22:16.672 --> 22:28.312
SHE CHUCKLES

22:28.312 --> 22:31.072
That's the guy.What?
That's the guy who attacked me.

22:31.072 --> 22:33.496
What are you doing?
Hey! Hey, asshole

22:33.496 --> 22:36.832
who squirted juice in my face.
Who you calling arsehole?

22:36.832 --> 22:39.112
I'm calling an asshole an asshole.

22:39.112 --> 22:41.992
Whoa!
You can't touch me. I'm 13.

22:41.992 --> 22:46.192
What? Really?
Well, you're pretty tall for 13.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.672
You should've thought of that before
you did your acidic-juice attack.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.432
What are you doing?
You're still on probation.

22:52.432 --> 22:54.952
Plus they're children.
I realise that now.

22:54.952 --> 22:57.976
I'm just gonna scare 'em.
Wait...

22:57.976 --> 23:00.592
You know,
I dunno where the heck you get off -

23:00.592 --> 23:02.992
Argh! Agh! Oh!

23:02.992 --> 23:05.992
Oh, yeah. Good one!

23:05.992 --> 23:08.032
Well, guess what?
I'm not scared this time,

23:08.032 --> 23:11.576
because I know that it's...
What is that - pineapple juice?

23:11.576 --> 23:13.552
HE LAUGHS
What, are you a baby?

23:13.552 --> 23:15.832
Why don't you drink an adult juice?

23:15.832 --> 23:19.192
THEY LAUGH
Whatever.

23:19.192 --> 23:26.032
Let's go.

23:26.032 --> 23:30.472
Did you scare them?
They'll remember me.

23:30.472 --> 23:53.816
