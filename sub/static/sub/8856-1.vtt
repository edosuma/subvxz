19:27.208 --> 19:28.708
REALITY CHECK.

19:28.792 --> 19:33.083
I THINK I CAN RECOGNIZE
MY OWN PARENTS'
HANDWRITING, EDDY.

19:33.167 --> 19:35.000
PUH-LEASE.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.208
Ed:
VROOM, VROOM, VROOM.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.875
I CUT THE AIR IN TWO!

19:40.958 --> 19:42.583
THIS SIDE'S YOURS,
DOUBLE-D.

19:42.667 --> 19:45.375
WE CAN SHARE
THE AIR, ED.

19:45.458 --> 19:47.875
IT'S MY AIR.
I AIN'T SHARING.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.000
ED, STOP SAWING THE AIR.

19:50.083 --> 19:51.167
MY RUG!

19:51.250 --> 19:55.583
SHAG RUGS ARE
A MAGNET FOR DISCARDED
NAIL TRIMMINGS.

19:55.667 --> 19:56.875
MY MAGAZINES!

19:56.958 --> 19:59.792
I HAVE PLENTY
OF EDUCATIONAL
READING MATERIAL

19:59.875 --> 20:00.792
WE CAN SHARE.

20:00.875 --> 20:02.125
NOT TO WORRY.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.000
THAT'S IT!

20:03.083 --> 20:04.583
PUT BACK
MY MAGAZINES,

20:04.667 --> 20:07.917
MY SHAG RUG,
AND MY AIR!

20:10.458 --> 20:11.292
MY MIRROR BALL!

20:11.375 --> 20:13.458
OOPS. IT WASN'T ME.

20:13.542 --> 20:15.125
SORRY.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.042
GET OUT OF MY ROOM!

20:18.125 --> 20:20.208
YOU'RE A PEST!

20:20.042 --> 20:23.083
FINE, NO NEED
TO REPEAT YOURSELF.

20:23.167 --> 20:25.542
NO, SIR,
I'M A GOOD LISTENER.

20:25.625 --> 20:28.208
I'LL JUST SLEEP UNDER
A BENCH SOMEWHERE,

20:28.292 --> 20:30.708
SEEING AS I CAN'T
RETURN TO MY HOME

20:30.792 --> 20:34.125
OR RELY ON MY FRIENDS.

20:34.875 --> 20:36.042
Eddy: OUT WITH YA!

20:36.125 --> 20:39.917
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME FOREVER
TO FIX ALL THIS AIR.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.792
WHAT'S WITH YOU?

20:45.875 --> 20:46.625
WHAT?

20:46.708 --> 20:48.917
STOP LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.083
DON'T--DON'T MAKE ME
HAVE TO KICK YOU OUT.

20:57.208 --> 20:58.292
DOUBLE-D!

20:58.375 --> 21:01.917
A ROCK PROVIDES SHELTER
TO MANY ARTHROPODS.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.292
DOUBLE-D,
DON'T TOUCH THAT ROCK!

21:04.375 --> 21:06.583
IT IS YOURS,
I SUPPOSE.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.750
I'LL GO ELSEWHERE.

21:07.833 --> 21:08.583
NO, WAIT.

21:08.667 --> 21:09.542
YOU GOT IT
ALL WRONG, PAL.

21:09.625 --> 21:10.583
IT WAS ALL ED'S FAULT,

21:10.667 --> 21:12.625
AND KEVIN, AS USUAL.

21:12.708 --> 21:13.500
KEVIN?

21:13.583 --> 21:15.500
YEAH, THAT
SQUARE-HEADED JERK.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.792
BUT KEVIN WASN'T
IN THIS SHOW, EDDY.

21:17.875 --> 21:21.417
THERE YOU GO.
SO MY ROOM'S YOUR ROOM.

21:21.500 --> 21:23.708
THANK YOU, EDDY.
THANK YOU.

21:23.792 --> 21:25.583
YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW
I WAS THERE.

21:25.667 --> 21:29.750
UH, OUR FACES
ARE TOUCHING, DOUBLE-D.

21:36.083 --> 21:38.167
NICE AND COMFY,
DOUBLE-D?

21:38.000 --> 21:40.042
TUCK ME, EDDY.

21:42.417 --> 21:44.042
THANK YOU, EDDY.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.375
HERE'S YOUR WARM MILK.

21:56.042 --> 21:58.292
"BIOLOGY
FOR THE ASTUTE."

21:58.375 --> 21:59.542
GOOD CHOICE, EDDY.

21:59.625 --> 22:01.208
"AND SO FROM
A STILL POND,

22:01.292 --> 22:05.125
A YOUNG MOSQUITO,
ALSO KNOWN AS
THE LARV--"

22:05.208 --> 22:06.417
WHAT'S THIS WORD?

22:06.500 --> 22:07.750
LARVA, EDDY.

22:07.833 --> 22:09.333
OH, YEAH.
WHERE WAS I?

22:09.417 --> 22:10.417
YOU KNOW, EDDY,

22:10.500 --> 22:12.167
MOTHER AND FATHER
BEFORE BED

22:12.250 --> 22:15.125
WOULD USUALLY
MASSAGE MY FEET.

22:15.000 --> 22:18.042
IT RELAXES ME SO.

22:18.125 --> 22:19.625
ED!

22:40.167 --> 22:41.458
ED, EDD, AND EDDY!
